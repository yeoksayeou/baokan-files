    "A great patriot, a great revolutionary, a great man – that is Mr. Sun Yat-sen."
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen's former adjutant, the Canadian Ma Kun, began his long conversation with the reporter with this sentence. Ma Kun was invited to China to participate in the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth.
    "I met Mr. Sun Yat-sen in 1908 when I was only twenty-one years old, in Calgary, Canada. At that time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was running around advocating for the Chee Kung Tong and the Tongmenghui, promoting his revolutionary ideas."
    The white-haired, ruddy-faced Canadian recalled.
    Since meeting Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Ma Kun, along with Chinese revolutionaries in Canada and the United States, engaged in activities such as contacting overseas Chinese, gathering righteous people, raising funds, and protecting Mr. Sun Yat-sen for the Chinese revolution. After the end of World War I, Ma Kun arrived in China in early 1921 at the invitation of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, directly participating in the Chinese revolution and serving as Mr. Sun Yat-sen's colonel adjutant, later awarded the rank of general by the Guangzhou Revolutionary Government.
    Until Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, Ma Kun was either by his side or on assignments, maintaining close contact with Mr. Sun Yat-sen throughout.
    Why would a Canadian follow Sun Yat-sen so loyally, risking his life for the Chinese revolution? The reporter couldn't help but ask this question. Ma Kun excitedly raised his hand and said, almost word by word, "I have never seen a person with blood and guts who, after coming into contact with Mr. Sun Yat-sen, hearing his speeches, and receiving his teachings, was unwilling to follow him in revolution. Mr. Sun Yat-sen often told me that the purpose of his revolution was first to make China a country respected by all countries in the world; to establish a government of the people, by the people, and for the people; he also wanted to ensure that everyone had food to eat, that workers could enjoy the fruits of their labor, and that children could receive education. What a great ambition!"
    "Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a very kind person, he loved the people," Ma Kun continued, "I remember when I was in Guangzhou, whenever overseas Chinese came to see him, he would always find time to have long talks with them, asking about their family situation and inquiring about the news of other comrades, making everyone feel very close to him. In his rare free time, he often went to the countryside to talk to the farmers, inquiring in detail about the people's suffering. Once, he even asked his adjutant to write down the address of a poor peasant woman and send relief supplies to her. But whenever wealthy merchants or so-called big shots came to visit him, we knew that they wouldn't talk for long."
    Then Ma Kun told a story to illustrate Mr. Sun Yat-sen's generosity and magnanimity. The incident happened at the Guangzhou General Headquarters. One day, Mr. Sun Yat-sen heard someone shouting and sent Adjutant Ma Xiang to investigate. Ma Xiang reported that a young suspected spy had been caught and was being tortured. Mr. Sun Yat-sen ordered the suspect to be brought to his office and had a sincere conversation with him alone; then he warned those responsible for the interrogation not to use torture during the interrogation in the future. "In this way, a friendly conversation made the spy sent by the Northern Warlords repent, and from then on he became a diligent worker who was loyal to Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionary cause."
    The topic turned to anecdotes of Mr. Sun Yat-sen commanding the revolutionary war. Ma Kun stood up from the sofa, pacing the room while speaking eloquently:
    "Once, a battle took place outside Guangzhou City. When Mr. Sun heard that our army's position was tight, he decided to go to the front line to inspect. On the way to the front by train, a train suddenly came head-on. The two trains had to stop midway. Mr. Sun got off the train and saw that the opposite train was carrying our troops, led by the commander of the front line where the fighting was fierce."
    Speaking here, Ma Kun suddenly picked up his cane from beside the wardrobe and pointed it forward. "Mr. Sun Yat-sen pointed his cane at the front and said to the commander, 'The enemy is in that direction, what are you doing in Guangzhou?' Under the personal supervision of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the troops who planned to escape back to Guangzhou were re-deployed to the front line, reversing the battle and achieving victory."
    Ma Kun also talked about Mr. Sun Yat-sen's fearless spirit in resolutely opposing imperialist interference in China's internal affairs. At that time, China's customs were entirely controlled by foreign powers. These foreign forces allocated all the surplus of customs revenue after paying the principal and interest of China's foreign debts to the Northern Warlords. Ma Kun said, "These funds actually became military expenses to support the Northern Warlords in carrying out civil war, so Mr. Sun Yat-sen decided to recover the Guangzhou Customs and allocate the surplus revenue to the revolutionary government. At this time, Britain, the United States, France, yes, and Portugal, all sent warships to threaten Guangzhou, and the situation was very critical. Mr. Sun Yat-sen knew that the strength of the enemy was vastly different from ours, but he said that history would eventually prove that his approach to recovering the customs was correct, and he persisted."
    "Speaking of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's contribution to the revolutionary cause, I don't think we should ignore the Whampoa Military Academy," Ma Kun reminded. "When I followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen to Guangzhou in 1921, he urgently felt that in order to unify the north and overthrow the warlords, it was necessary to establish a revolutionary armed force. But first we had to find a group of military instructors. On the one hand, Mr. Sun Yat-sen wanted us to hire instructors from Britain, the United States, and Canada, and on the other hand, he telegraphed the Soviet ambassador stationed in Beijing, asking him to help hire Soviet advisors. At that time, the great powers only recognized the Beijing warlord regime and did not recognize Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary regime, so it was difficult to recruit instructors from Britain, the United States, and other countries. However, soon after, Borodin led a group of Soviet advisors to Guangzhou.
    Ma Kun said: "When I first arrived in Guangzhou, there was a saying: 'One Yunnan soldier is worth two or three Guangdong soldiers.' However, after the officers trained in the Whampoa Military Academy were assigned to various camps and regiments to serve as instructors, the situation changed. In less than a year or two, another saying spread: 'One Guangdong soldier is worth two or three Yunnan soldiers.'"
    However, Ma Kun emphasized: "The Whampoa Military Academy is not just a place to train ordinary people into officers and soldiers. Its achievement, I think, lies in its political education for officers about their military responsibilities and what they should fight for. This is also a factor in the victory of the Northern Expedition."
    "You know, the director of the political department of the Whampoa Military Academy back then was none other than the Premier of your People's Republic today."
    Regarding Mr. Sun Yat-sen's private life, Ma Kun said with infinite remembrance: "Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a very diligent and simple person. He was always either reading, writing, or lecturing. His only entertainment was to occasionally visit Baiyun Mountain or go to the countryside to chat with farmers, and even such opportunities for relaxation were few and far between. Many people say that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was poor all his life and had no savings, but who knows that when he died, not only was there no surplus wealth, but even the residence in Shanghai donated by overseas Chinese in the Americas was mortgaged? What a great revolutionary, what a great man."
    Didn't Mr. Sun Yat-sen have any shortcomings? Ma Kun asked himself this question. "If Mr. Sun Yat-sen had any shortcomings, I think it was his excessive kindness. He couldn't imagine that anyone would commit crimes against their own country. He once mistakenly regarded some people who were solely engaged in seeking personal gain as people who were working for the country and the people and trusted them."
    Asked about his personal friendship with Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Ma Kun said, "What can I say? He was a true patriot, a true leader. Anyone with a little brain, including his enemies, couldn't help but admire his integrity, sincerity, greatness, and talent. I was just one of his followers."
    Speaking of his two visits to the new China, Ma Kun said, "I am very happy about the progress I have seen in China." He said that before he came to China last December, he thought that anyone in China who dared to mention Sun Yat-sen's name would be in danger of being regarded as a reactionary. "Who knew that after I arrived in China, I saw people everywhere respecting Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and I realized that the rumors about Mr. Sun Yat-sen from the outside world were all unfounded."
    He said he had visited many factories and agricultural producers' cooperatives. "I saw that the lives of people everywhere have been greatly improved compared to the past. I have never seen so many smiling faces. Here I saw socialism. I am very happy to see that in China, many democratic parties are working together under the leadership of the Communist Party to build a socialist society. All this has opened my eyes."

    访孙中山先生生前的副官——马坤
    新华社记者　周立方
    “伟大的爱国者、伟大的革命家，伟大的人——这就是孙中山先生。”
    中山先生生前的副官、加拿大人马坤以这句话开始了同记者的长谈。马坤这次是应邀参加孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念来中国的。
    “我认识中山先生，还是1908年，我才二十一岁，在加拿大柯尔加利城的时候。那时中山先生正为致公堂、同盟会事奔走呼号，宣传他的革命主张。”
    这位白发皓然而红光满面的加拿大人这样回忆说。
    自从认识中山先生之后，马坤就在加拿大、美国各地同中国革命志士一道，为中国革命事业从事联络华侨、召集义士、筹措经费、保护中山先生等工作。第一次世界大战结束之后，马坤应中山先生召于1921年初抵达中国，直接参加中国革命，并任中山先生的上校副官，以后又由广州革命政府授予将军衔。
    一直到中山先生逝世的时候止，马坤不是随侍在侧，就是衔命奔驰，同中山先生始终保持着亲密的联系。
    为什么一个加拿大人会这样忠心耿耿地追随孙中山先生，为中国革命事业而出生入死呢？记者禁不住提出了这个问题。马坤兴奋地举起手，几乎一字一顿地说道，“我还没有见过一个有血性的人，在同中山先生有所接触，听了他的讲演，受到他的教导之后，而不愿意随着他去革命的。中山先生常对我说，他革命的目的首先是要使中国成为一个受世界各国尊敬的国家；建立一个民有、民治、民享的政府；他还要使人人都有饭吃，使劳动者能享受自己劳动的成果；使儿童受到教育。这是何等的抱负！”
    “中山先生是一个非常仁慈的人，他热爱人民，”马坤继续说，“我记得在广州的时候，凡有华侨来看他，他总是抽暇同他们长谈，问起他们家庭的情况，打听其他同志的消息，使大家感到十分亲切。在他难得的空闲时间里，他常到乡下去同农民谈话，详细询问民间疾苦。有一次他还叫副官把一个贫苦农妇的地址写下来，着人送救济物品去。但是每当富商巨贾，或者所谓的大人物来拜访他的时候，我们都知道他们是不会谈多久的。”
    接着马坤讲了一个故事来说明中山先生的敦厚博大的胸怀。事情发生在广州大本营。一天，中山先生听到有人在叫喊，就派马湘副官去察看究竟。马湘报告说捉住了一个年轻的间谍嫌疑犯，正在加以刑讯。中山先生吩咐把嫌疑犯带到他的办公室去，并且单独同他作了恳切的谈话；然后又告诫负责审讯的人以后不得在审讯中施用刑罚。“就这样，凭着一席和蔼的谈话使那个北洋军阀派来的间谍翻然悔悟，从此成了效忠中山先生和革命事业的勤奋的工作者。”
    话题转到中山先生当年在指挥革命战争中的轶事。马坤从沙发上站了起来，一面在房间里踱着阔步，一面滔滔不绝地讲了下去：
    “有一次，广州城外发生战斗。先生听说我军阵地吃紧，就决定到前线去视察。在我们乘火车赴前线途中，迎面突然开来了一列火车。两列火车不得不中途停止下来。先生下车一看，发现对面那列车上载有我军部队，率领他们的正是战事激烈的那条战线上的指挥官。”
    说到这里，马坤突地从衣橱旁边拿起他的手杖向前一指。“中山先生就这样用手杖指着前方对指挥官说，‘敌人在那个方向，你们到广州去干什么？’打算逃回广州的部队在中山先生亲自督率之下重新开赴前线，扭转了战局，获得了胜利。”
    马坤又谈到中山先生坚决反对帝国主义干涉中国内政的大无畏精神。当时中国海关尽操在列强各国手中。这些外国势力把海关岁入除去支付中国所欠外债的本息之后的盈余，全部拨交北洋军阀。马坤说，“这些款项实际上成了支持北洋军阀进行内战的军费，因此中山先生决定要收复广州海关，并把岁入盈余拨交革命政府。这时英国、美国、法国，不错，还有葡萄牙，都出动炮舰威胁广州，形势十分危急。中山先生明知敌我力量悬殊，但是他说历史终会证明他收复海关的做法是对的，并且坚持了下去。”
    “谈到中山先生对革命事业的建树，我想我们不应该忽略黄埔军官学校，”马坤提醒说。“1921年我随中山先生到广州的时候，他迫切地感觉到为了北上统一，打倒军阀，必须建立一支革命的武装力量。但是我们首先要找到一批军事教官。中山先生一方面要我们向英、美、加各国聘请教官，一方面打电报给驻北京的苏联大使，请他协助延聘苏联顾问。当时列强各国只承认北京军阀政权，不承认中山先生的革命政权，因此从英美等国招聘教官困难很多。但是，不久后鲍罗亭就率领着一批苏联顾问到广州来了。
    马坤说：“我初到广州的时候，那里还流传着这样一句话：‘一个滇军抵得两三个粤军。’然而在黄埔军官学校训练出来的军官分配到各营团去担任教官之后，局面就改变了。不到一两年，另外一句话流传起来了：‘一个粤军抵得两三个滇军了。’”
    但是，马坤强调指出：“黄埔军官学校并不仅是一个把普通人训练成军官和士兵的场所。它的成果，我认为，在于它对士官们进行了有关军人职责以及他们应该为什么而战的政治教育。这也就是北伐战争胜利的一个因素。”
    “你知道，当年黄埔军官学校的政治部主任不是别人，正是今天你们人民共和国的总理啊。”
    关于孙中山先生的私生活，马坤带着无限怀念的心情说：“中山先生是个十分勤勉朴素的人。他一向不是读书、写作就是讲演。他唯一的娱乐就是偶尔到白云山去游览，到乡下去同农民闲谈，就是这种消遣的机会也是屈指可数的。许多人都说中山先生一生清贫，了无积蓄，但是谁知道他逝世的时候，不仅没有余财，就连在上海的那所美洲华侨捐赠的住宅都抵押出去了呢，多么伟大的革命家，多么伟大的人啊。”
    难道孙中山先生就没有缺点吗？马坤自己提出了这个问题。“假如说中山先生有任何缺点的话，我认为那就是他的过分仁慈。他竟不能想像还有人会对自己的国家犯罪。他曾经误把一些专事谋取私利的人当作了为国为民的人而加以信任。”
    问到他同中山先生的私人友谊，马坤说，“我能够说什么呢？他是一个真正的爱国者，真正的领袖。只要稍有头脑的人，包括他的敌人在内，没有不敬佩他的正直、诚恳、伟大和才干的。我只不过是他的一个追随者而已。”
    马坤在谈到他两度访问新中国的印象时说，“我在中国所见到的进步使我十分高兴。”他说他去年12月到中国来之前，还以为在中国只要有人敢于提到孙中山的名字就有被当作反动派的危险。“哪知我到中国之后，到处看到人们对中山先生怀着尊敬，才知道外界关于孙中山先生的传说都是毫无根据的流言。”
    他说他参观了许多工厂和农业生产合作社。“我看到各地老百姓的生活比从前是大大提高了。我从来没有看见过这样多的欢笑的面孔。在这里我看见了社会主义。我很高兴看到在中国许多民主党派在共产党领导下同心协力，为建设社会主义社会而努力。这一切打开了我的眼界。”
