    Egyptian People Are Unyielding
    Port Said Residents Refuse to Cooperate with Occupiers

    Xinhua News Agency, 14th - According to Western news agencies, Egyptian residents of Port Said are resolutely refusing to cooperate with the Anglo-French occupation forces. Shops in the city remained closed on November 13, and the entire city life is at a standstill. Most parts of the city have no electricity, and some areas have only two hours of water supply per day.
    Traitors who cooperate with the Anglo-French forces are being sanctioned by patriots. Leaflets warning people not to cooperate with the enemy are circulating in the city.
    On November 12, an important machine in the city's central telephone exchange was taken away, and telecommunications between Port Fuad and Port Said, which are under Anglo-French occupation, were interrupted for several hours. In the western district of Port Said, patriotic speeches were given, and residents gathered in many places to listen. Anglo-French army patrols were forced to disperse the crowds. Local residents often listen to broadcasts from Cairo Radio. The Anglo-French occupation authorities stated that they would soon jam the broadcasts from Cairo Radio.

    埃及人民不可屈服
    塞得港居民拒绝同占领者合作
    新华社14日讯　据西方通讯社报道，塞得港的埃及居民坚决拒绝同英法占领军合作，城内的商店到11月13日仍然拒绝开门营业，整个城市生活处在停顿状态。这个城市的大部分地区没有电力，某些地区水的供应每天只有两小时。
    同英法军队合作的通敌分子受到爱国者的制裁。城内流传着警告人们不要和敌人合作的传单。
    11月12日，市内中央电话交换台的一部重要机器被人取走，在英法军队占领下的福得港同塞得港之间的电讯中断了好几个钟点。在塞得港西区，有人发表爱国演说，居民在好些地方聚集起来听讲，英法军队的巡逻队强迫驱散人群。当地居民经常收听开罗电台的广播，英法占领军当局表示，不久就要以电波扰乱开罗电台的广播。
