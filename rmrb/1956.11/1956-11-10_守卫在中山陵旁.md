    Before the ninetieth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, we visited Fan Liang and Qiu You, staff members of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing. They used to serve as guards for Mr. Sun Yat-sen and later, for a long time, guarded Mr. Sun Yat-sen's tomb.

    What force supported them, enabling them to steadfastly hold their guard posts for thirty years as if it were just one day? That is the greatness of Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

    If we were to ask, what benefits did Mr. Sun Yat-sen ever give them? Then, that benefit is that he taught them the principles of being a person. When they first stood guard for Mr. Sun Yat-sen at Yuexiu Building (now the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall), Mr. Sun Yat-sen kindly asked them: "Why did you come here? Do you want to become officials?" The reply was "To save the country." Mr. Sun Yat-sen smiled. Mr. Sun Yat-sen often taught them the great principle of being "public servants of the people," "Life should be for the purpose of service, not for the purpose of acquisition, don't be high officials, but do great things."

    Sun Yat-sen's countless speeches at Guangdong Higher Normal School (the predecessor of Sun Yat-sen University), Huangpu Military Academy, and Guangzhou First Park, had "influenced" them, causing them to believe in the later revolutionary Three Principles of the People. In daily life contact, they even felt more deeply the greatness of Sun Yat-sen's personality. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was not afraid of the strike by the comprador class Chen Lianbo's Merchant Corps and the rebellion of the counter-revolutionary Chen Jiongming, but he was so kind and generous to his subordinates. Mr. Sun Yat-sen did not allow those close to him to call him "President" or "Generalissimo," but asked them to call him "Mr." When Mr. Sun Yat-sen departed for a speech, he was unaccustomed to seeing guards standing outside the car window, and often walked with the guards to the school because of this. At Nanhua Temple, Mr. Sun Yat-sen ate winter mushroom porridge and roast piglet with the guards, and during an outing in Baiyun Mountain, Mr. Sun Yat-sen initiated the organization of a mountain climbing race for the guard team. These ordinary and trivial things, however, infected the guards everywhere and they never forgot them.

    After Sun Yat-sen's death, those who recited the "will" but harbored ulterior motives took the opportunity to usurp the fruits of the revolution, while these guards who had been deeply spiritually influenced by Sun Yat-sen silently grieved and loyally guarded Sun Yat-sen's mourning hall. When the high officials of the Kuomintang asked them "what official positions they wanted to take," they replied: "We are from humble backgrounds, and do not want to be officials, we would rather follow Mr. Sun Yat-sen in life and death."

    After the completion of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, the main gate of the mausoleum was a four-inch thick bronze door, on which was installed a very delicate and mysterious lock. The white-haired old locksmith taught four young guards the secret of opening this lock. Every morning, they personally gently opened the bronze door to let fresh air into the mausoleum, and in the evening, they carefully locked the bronze door and silently said goodnight to the spirit.

    Among these four young guards, one was Qiu You, who is now a 52-year-old man. People still often see him personally carrying a load of clean water, stepping up more than three hundred and ninety stone steps, and scrubbing every corner of the mausoleum clean.

    However, when people talk to him about the past years, Qiu You, this 52-year-old man, feels endless bitterness and pain in his heart. In the third year after he accompanied the remains from Beijing to Nanjing, the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang authorities, under the pretext of reducing redundant personnel and adjusting the establishment, wanted to dismiss more than twenty guards who faithfully guarded the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Qiu You and Xiao Hongxi and the other three who had originally accompanied the remains to Nanjing were also included in the surplus list. Despite repeated requests, negotiations were ineffective. Finally, the four had to bid farewell to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, which they had accompanied for three years, and went their separate ways.

    The Chinese nation was in a deep national crisis. Chiang Kai-shek abandoned Sun Yat-sen's remains and fled to Chongqing. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum still stood tall on Purple Mountain, and the guards who accompanied Mr. Sun, like hundreds of millions of people across the country, unyieldingly survived the eight years of disaster.

    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Qiu You searched for old friends everywhere. Through personal connections, he finally returned to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in 1945. Qiu You stepped up the stone steps of the mausoleum one by one with mixed feelings. The desolate scene of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum after the catastrophe evoked his infinite emotion. When he walked to the "The World is for All" pavilion, he learned from the conversations of the guards that right under this pavilion, the foreign rulers had shot and killed his old comrades-in-arms – the guards who had defended the mausoleum, Liu Xiang, Wen Yan, Huang Hui and others. Walking further up, the bullet marks on the stone steps were still vivid. The bottom of the bronze cauldron was pierced through, and the knife marks on the edge of the cauldron were still there. Entering the mausoleum, the four walls were desolate, and the ground was covered with dust. The last bronze door of the mausoleum had been hacked and chopped out of shape. This scene by scene, tightly tugged at the heartstrings of Qiu You, this loyal peasant. When he discovered that the face of Sun Yat-sen's statue had been damaged, he couldn't help but burst into tears. He stood motionless in front of the mausoleum for a long time, unable to utter a sound, as if he could hear Sun Yat-sen's impassioned voice again: "If imperialism is not overthrown, the Chinese nation will not gain freedom and independence!" At this time, Qiu You understood Sun Yat-sen's nationalist thought even more.

    The Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum after the "miserable victory" was still bleak. The big bureaucrats of the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang complained that the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum was built too high, and cars could not drive up, so they rarely came to pay their respects, and even fewer people presented wreaths.

    One sunny day, a group of visitors to the mausoleum, dressed in simple clothes and with a friendly attitude, came to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. They respectfully entered the mausoleum and presented wreaths with ribbons that read, "To the Spirit of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Presented respectfully by Zhou Enlai, Head of the Delegation of the Chinese Communist Party, and all members." At this time, it is hard to imagine the feelings of joy and sorrow mingled in the heart of Fan Liang, the guard of the mausoleum. Fan Liang really did not expect that the spirit of Mr. Sun Yat-sen would receive the condolences and comfort of the Communist Party and Mr. Sun Yat-sen's old friend Zhou Enlai at this time!

    After paying respects to the mausoleum, Comrade Zhou Enlai saw more than ten sentries standing with guns and asked, "Are they military police?" Fan Liang said, "This is the escort team sent by Director Ma Xiang (Mr. Sun Yat-sen's former adjutant, who was then the Director of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Guarding Office)." Comrade Zhou Enlai expressed his great gratitude. Before leaving, he gave Fan Liang two business cards and asked him to pass them on to Mr. Ma Xiang. One business card was printed with Zhou Enlai's name, and the other was printed with He Chengxiang's name.

    This group of visitors to the mausoleum left an unforgettable impression on Fan Liang's heart. In those dark days, a ray of light began to appear in their minds. In 1949, Nanjing was liberated. From this time on, the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum truly received the respect and care it deserved.

    Today's Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, although the sound of falling leaves from the plane trees can also make people feel the atmosphere of late autumn, the warm sunshine, the neatly trimmed evergreen pines and cypresses, and the vigorous blooming flowers in the botanical garden, bring spring in autumn to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Not long ago, representatives of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Congress came to pay their respects to the mausoleum. Representative Zhou Shoujuan recited a seven-character quatrain: "Dense shade lines the road, deep green, Tall bamboo and pines, a great collection, The world is for all, now realized, May this intention be reported to Mr. Sun Yat-sen". Now, the number of people from home and abroad who come to pay their respects is increasing year by year. From January to October this year alone, there have been 1.2 million domestic visitors and more than 4,000 international friends. Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of China's socialist revolution, has been here, and Soekarno, Indonesia's best friend of the Chinese people, has also been here. He once said: "Sun Yat-sen is not only the leader of the Chinese people, but also the leader of the Asian people."

    Many young people took their oaths to join the League in front of the mausoleum, and many children raised their hands in salute in front of the statues. Among these many young people, there are the sons and daughters of the young guards of that year. Fan Liang is now the father of six children, and the guard Qiu You is now the father of seven children. Their children work in the Qaidam Basin, study in universities, and more of them study in middle and primary schools. These guards of Sun Yat-sen have broken free from the years of neglect before liberation and are living respected and peaceful lives. They will more faithfully guard the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and spend their old age happily.

    守卫在中山陵旁
    本报记者　张竞　甄为民
    在孙中山诞辰九十周年纪念日前，我们访问了南京中山陵的工作人员范良、丘有。他们两人过去给中山先生充当卫士，以后，长期地看守着中山先生的陵墓。
    是什么力量支持着他们，使他们三十年如一日地坚守着卫士的岗位呢？这就是中山先生伟大的地方。
    如果说，中山先生曾经给他们什么好处？那末，这个好处就是教会他们做人的道理。当他们第一次在越秀楼（现为中山纪念堂）为中山先生站岗的时候，中山先生曾经亲切地问过他们：“你们为什么要到我们这里来？你想做官吗？”答复是“为了救国”。中山先生笑了。先生常常教育他们做“人民公仆”的大道理，“人生要以服务为目的，不可以夺取为目的，不要做大官，要做大事业。”
    孙中山先生在广东高等师范学堂（即中山大学前身）、黄埔军校、广州第一公园等地的无数次演说，曾经“感化”过他们，使他们相信了后期的革命的三民主义。在日常生活的接触中，更使他们感到中山先生的伟大人格。中山先生不畏买办阶级陈廉伯商团的罢市和反革命陈炯明的叛变，而对于自己的部下，又是那样的仁慈宽厚。中山先生不允许亲近他的人称他为“大总统”“大元帅”，而要他们称自己为“先生”。先生出发演讲，看到汽车窗外站立着卫士，很不习惯，往往因此而和卫士一起步行到学校中去。在南华寺，先生和卫士们共同吃过冬菇稀饭和烤小猪，在白云山郊游，先生发起组织卫士队的登山竞走。这些平凡和琐碎的小事，却处处使卫士们受到感染而永志不忘。
    中山先生死后，那一些口念“遗嘱”而心怀异志的人，趁势篡夺革命果实，而这些曾经在精神上深深受过中山先生感染的卫士们，却默默含哀，忠诚地守着中山先生的灵堂。当国民党的大官们问他们“愿做什么官”的时候，他们回答说：“我们是苦出身，不愿做什么官，情愿生死追随中山先生。”
    中山陵建成后，陵寝的正门，是一扇四寸厚的铜门，就在这铜门上，装着一把非常精巧奥妙的锁钥，白发苍苍的老锁匠教会四个年青的卫士打开这把钥锁的秘密。每天清晨，他们亲手把铜门轻轻打开，让陵寝换上新鲜的空气，黄昏，又小心地把铜门锁上，默默地向英灵道晚安。
    在这四个青年卫士中，有一个就是丘有，现在他已经是五十二岁的老人了，人们还常看见他亲自挑着一担清水，踏上三百九十多级石阶，把陵堂的每一个角落洗刷得干干净净。
    可是，当人们和他一谈起过去的年月，丘有，这五十二岁的老人的心里，就涌起了无限的辛酸和痛楚。在他陪着遗灵由北京来南京后的第三年，蒋介石国民党当权者，借裁减冗员，调整编制的名义，便要把忠心守卫着中山陵的二十多个卫士遣散，丘有和原来陪着灵寝来南京的肖洪禧等四人，也列入了编余的名单，虽经再三要求，但交涉无效，最后，四个人只得依依不舍地告别了这陪伴了三年的中山陵墓各奔前程了。
    中华民族在深重的民族危机中。蒋介石丢下了中山先生的遗体，逃到重庆去了。中山先生的陵墓依然屹立在紫金山上，陪伴着先生的卫士和全国亿万人民一样，不屈地渡过了八年的灾难。
    抗战胜利后，丘有四处寻访故友，通过私人关系，终于在1945年，又回到了中山陵来了。丘有怀着万感交集的心情，一级一级踏上了陵墓的石阶。劫后中山陵的凄凉景象，勾起了他无限的感慨。当他走到“天下为公”亭下，从守陵警察的谈话中，知道就在这亭子下，异族统治者曾经枪杀了他的老战友——坚守着陵墓的卫士刘祥、温燕、黄惠三等多人。再走上去，石级上累累弹痕，还历历在目，铜鼎鼎底洞穿，鼎边刀痕犹在，进入灵堂，四壁萧条，遍地尘埃，陵寝最后那道铜门，已经被刀砍斧削得不成样子。此情此景，一步步紧扣着丘有这个忠实农民的心弦，当他发现中山先生座像的面部被损坏时，已经禁不住热泪盈眶。他呆立在陵前，半天都发不出声来，耳边好像又响起了中山先生的慷慨激昂的声音：“帝国主义不打倒，中华民族就得不到自由独立！”这时候，丘有才更加明白了中山先生民族主义的思想。
    “惨胜”之后的中山陵，依然在惨淡中，蒋介石国民党的大官僚们，埋怨中山陵建筑得太高，汽车开不上去，很少前来拜谒，献花圈的人就更少了。
    一个晴朗的日子，中山陵来了一批穿著朴素、态度和蔼的谒陵人，他们恭恭敬敬地进入了灵堂，献上了花圈，花圈飘带上写着，“孙中山先生灵右。中国共产党代表团团长周恩来暨全体团员敬献”。这时，你很难想像守灵的卫士范良的悲喜交集的心情。范良真没有想到中山先生的英灵，却在这时候得到共产党和中山先生的故旧周恩来的悼念和慰籍！
    谒陵以后，周恩来同志看到十多个荷枪站立的岗哨，问：“他们是宪兵吗？”范良说“这是马湘处长（中山先生生前的副官，当时担任中山陵拱卫处长）派来的拱卫队，周恩来同志表示非常感谢！”临行前，并交给范良两张名片，要他转交给马湘先生。一张名片上印着周恩来的名字，另一张印着何成湘的名字。
    这批谒陵人在范良心中，留下了难忘的印象，在那黑暗的日子里，他们脑海中开始出现了一线光明。1949年，南京解放了，从这时起，中山陵才真正的受到了应有的尊重和爱护。
    今日的中山陵，虽然从梧桐叶落声中，也能使人感受到深秋的气味，但是那和煦的阳光，那修剪得齐整的苍松翠柏，那植物园里的挺劲盛开的百花，给中山陵带来了秋天里的春天。不久前，江苏省人民代表大会的代表曾来谒陵，代表周瘦鹃先生曾口占七绝一首：“浓荫夹道沉沉绿，修竹齐松大集成，天下为公今实现，好将斯意告先生”。现在，国内外来仰谒的人逐年增加，单今年1至10月，国内就有一百二十万人，国际友人有四千多，我国社会主义革命的领导者毛泽东主席曾经来到过这里，中国人民最好的朋友、印度尼西亚总统苏加诺也曾经来到过这里。他曾说过：“孙中山不但是中国人民的领袖，而且也是亚洲人民的领袖”。
    许多青年在陵前宣誓入团，许多少年儿童在雕像前举起了致敬的手，在这许多青少年中，就有当年的青年卫士的儿女。范良现在是六个孩子的父亲，卫士丘有现在是七个孩子的父亲，他们的儿女，有的在柴达木盆地工作，有的在大学里学习，更多的是在中、小学里读书。孙中山先生的这些卫士已摆脱了解放前受人冷落的岁月，过着受人尊敬的安乐的日子，他们将更忠实地守护在中山陵前，欢乐地度过他们的晚年。
