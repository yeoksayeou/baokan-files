Xinhua News Agency, 31st. From late October, over 1,700 branches of the Beijing Sewing Production Cooperative and some jointly-owned public-private sewing shops have been accepting orders for cotton clothes from residents, guaranteeing completion within half a month.

Recently, Beijing experienced a strain on winter clothing processing. This is because people's purchasing power increased after the wage reform, and many women, after joining the workforce, did not have time to sew their own clothes, so the number and quantity of clothing purchased increased. At the same time, commercial departments, fearing a shortage of clothing, have been placing orders with sewing cooperatives and shops since autumn, occupying some of the sewing capacity that was previously available for customers' small jobs.

Now, the Beijing Sewing Production Cooperative Union and the Clothing Industry Company have taken the following measures to solve this problem: all sewing cooperatives and shops will prioritize making cotton clothes, followed by leather clothes, and then single-layer clothes; service-oriented sewing cooperatives and shops have stopped accepting processing orders from commercial departments, and orders already accepted will be transferred to manufacturing-oriented sewing cooperatives and shops; some manufacturing-oriented cooperatives and shops have adjusted their labor organization and extracted manpower to support their service-oriented counterparts; housewives near the branches are being absorbed as temporary auxiliary workers as appropriate; the Municipal Sewing Cooperative Union has also adjusted the labor force based on the uneven workload of each sewing cooperative.

### 北京缝纫社缝纫店  先给居民做棉衣

    北京缝纫社缝纫店
    先给居民做棉衣
    据新华社31日讯　从10月下旬起，北京市缝纫生产社的一千七百多个门市部和部分公私合营缝纫店，都已接受居民的棉装加工，保证在半个月内交活。
    北京最近曾出现冬季服装加工的紧张情况。这是因为在工资改革以后人民购买力提高，许多妇女参加劳动以后没有时间自缝服装，因此购买服装的人数和数量增加。同时，商业部门怕服装不够卖，入秋以来纷向缝纫社和店铺加工订货，占据部分为顾客作零活的缝纫能力。
    现在，北京市缝纫生产合作社联合社和服装工业公司采取了以下的措施来解决这个问题：各缝纫社和店铺都先做棉服，次做皮服，后作单服；服务性的缝纫社和店铺停止接受商业部门的加工定货，以往接受的移交给制造性的缝纫社和店铺去做；有些制造性的社、店调整了劳动组织，抽出力量支援服务性的同行；酌情吸收门市部附近的家庭妇女做临时辅助工；市缝纫联合社也根据各缝纫社忙闲不均的情况，调剂了劳动力。
