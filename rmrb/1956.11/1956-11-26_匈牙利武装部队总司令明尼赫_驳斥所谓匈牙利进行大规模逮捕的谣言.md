Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 24th: Hungarian People's Republic Armed Forces Commander Münnich, in a conversation with a "People's Freedom" reporter, refuted rumors of mass arrests in Hungary. Münnich said that arrests or detentions are carried out by the Hungarian Armed Forces.

Münnich said, "I would like to emphasize once again that not a single Hungarian citizen has been deported abroad. All those arrested have solid evidence proving that they committed specific crimes such as murder, robbery, sabotage, or violent disruption of work. Of course, those who take actions to obstruct the restoration of normal order will also be detained. There are also cases where someone has accused someone out of personal revenge. But as soon as the matter is clarified, the detained person is immediately released."

Münnich said, "Everyone knows that thousands of prisoners have escaped from prisons. Therefore, it is only natural that more arrests are being made at the moment than at other times. However, some people are taking advantage of this situation to spread all kinds of absurd rumors."

    匈牙利武装部队总司令明尼赫
    驳斥所谓匈牙利进行大规模逮捕的谣言
    新华社25日讯　塔斯社布达佩斯24日讯：匈牙利人民共和国武装部队总司令明尼赫在对“人民自由报”记者的谈话中，驳斥了所谓匈牙利进行大规模逮捕的谣言。明尼赫说，逮捕或者拘留，都是由匈牙利武装部队来执行的。
    明尼赫说，我想再一次着重指出，没有一个匈牙利公民被放逐国外。凡是被逮捕的，都有确凿的证据证明他们犯有杀害、抢劫、怠工或者是暴力破坏工作这些具体的罪行。当然，那些采取行动来阻挠恢复正常秩序的人也要被拘留。也有这种情况，有人由于私仇告发了某一个人。但是只要事情一查明，被拘留的人就立即被释放。
    明尼赫说，大家知道，从监狱里逃出了几千名犯人。因此，目前比其他时候进行较多的逮捕，这是十分自然的事。但是，有人利用这种情况来散布各种无稽的谣言。
