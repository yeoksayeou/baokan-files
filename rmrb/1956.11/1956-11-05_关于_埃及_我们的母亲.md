About "Egypt - Our Mother"
Ma Hanbing, former Deputy Head and Artistic Director of the Chinese Cultural and Artistic Delegation to Egypt

The Cultural and Artistic Delegation of the People's Republic of China visited the Republic of Egypt this year. In addition to introducing Chinese art, the delegation also learned some Egyptian songs and dances. "Egypt - Our Mother" is one of them.

This song is popular among the broad masses of the Egyptian people and the armed forces of the Republic of Egypt. At every mass gathering, people sing this song and march into the venue in neat steps. This song inspires the Egyptian people to love their motherland and encourages the Egyptian people and army to bravely defeat the invaders and defend the freedom and independence of their country. Today, as British and French colonialists shamelessly and frantically attack the sacred territory of Egypt, this song will inevitably inspire the broad masses of the Egyptian people and army to bravely resist foreign invaders.

The tune of this song is a folk song. It is said that the lyricist was a young Egyptian soldier. He disappeared during the overthrow of the Farouk dynasty, and his whereabouts are still unknown. When singing this song, it starts from section A to section B. After section B is finished, section A is sung again, and then section B is skipped to sing section C. After section C is finished, section A is sung again to end. When singing, it is required to be solemn and powerful. This song can be sung as a march.

    关于“埃及——我们的母亲”
    前中国赴埃及文化艺术代表团副团长兼艺术指导  马寒冰
    中华人民共和国文化艺术代表团，今年访问了埃及共和国。代表团除介绍我国的艺术外，还学习了埃及的若干歌曲和舞蹈。“埃及——我们的母亲”就是其中的一个。
    这首歌曲流行在广大埃及人民和埃及共和国军队当中，每次群众集会时，人们都唱着这首歌曲，迈着整齐的步伐，进入会场。这首歌曲激励着埃及人民热爱自己的祖国，鼓舞着埃及人民和军队，英勇地击败侵略者，保卫祖国的自由和独立。今天，当英、法殖民主义者无耻地、疯狂地进攻着埃及神圣领土的时候，这支歌曲必然会鼓舞着广大埃及人民和军队，英勇地去抗击外来侵略者。
    这首歌曲的曲调是民间歌曲，据说词作者是一个年青的埃及军人。在推翻法鲁克王朝时失踪，迄今还不知道他的下落。演唱这支歌曲的时候，先由A段至B段，B段唱完后再唱A段，然后跳过B段唱C段，C段唱完后再唱A段结束。演唱时要求严肃，雄壮有力。这支歌曲可以作为进行曲唱。
