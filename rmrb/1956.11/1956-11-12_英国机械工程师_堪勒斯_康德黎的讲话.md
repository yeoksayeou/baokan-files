Mr. Chairman, Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen!

It is a great honor to be invited to say a few words today. I am speaking on behalf of my family. My elder brother, Sir Keith Kenderdine, is unable to leave London due to the short notice, so he asked me to represent him.

When we were young, my brothers and I were very familiar with Mr. Sun, because before the revolution, whenever he came to England, he always stayed at our house. In 1911, when he received a telegram from China asking him to return immediately to organize the government, he was staying at our house.

We all know Mr. Sun's greatness and wisdom, but our brothers' memories of him are personal, and our main memory is of his great kindness. Whether he was in contemplation or in lively discussion of important issues with my father or others, whenever we greeted him, he always spoke to us kindly. Although we were children, we knew he was a great man.

I remember an incident that happened at our country residence: Mr. Sun, with a unique expression, was walking back and forth in the garden, his hands behind his back, his head lowered in thought. I was very young at the time, about seven or eight years old. I was about to run over and greet him when I suddenly stopped. "No," I said to myself, "it's best not to disturb him; he may be thinking about something very important." So I started to slip away. But Mr. Sun suddenly saw me. He smiled, stopped, called me over, touched my head, and said a few kind words. I remember the scene clearly—the afternoon sun shining on Mr. Sun's face, his gray suit, the lush green trees—as if it were yesterday.

My family loved Mr. Sun, and we all felt he was a remarkable figure whose great plan to modernize China would one day be realized. He foresaw and warned us that there would be many difficulties ahead and that success would be slow; but we had no doubt that his ideals would eventually triumph; even if he himself might not live to see that day. That is why we are gathered here today, just as my brother (Admiral Sir Colin Kenderdine) and I had the honor of attending Mr. Sun's state funeral in Nanjing in 1929. We are now gathered to commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of one of the greatest figures in the world.

I have nothing more to say.

I wish you peace and prosperity.

### 英国机械工程师  堪勒斯·康德黎的讲话

    英国机械工程师
    堪勒斯·康德黎的讲话主席先生，诸位阁下，
    女士们和先生们！
    今天我被邀来说几句话，感到非常荣幸。我是代表我的家庭来说话的。我的长兄，凯斯·康德黎爵士，因为时间仓促不能离开伦敦，所以要我来代表他。
    当我们年轻的时候，我的兄弟们和我同孙先生都很熟识，因为在革命以前，每当他来到英国，总是住在我们家里。在1911年，当他从中国收到一份电报，要他立刻回国组织政府的时候，他就住在我们家里。
    我们都知道孙先生的伟大和智慧，但是我们兄弟们对他的记忆是属于个人方面的，而我们的主要记忆是他的伟大的慈祥。不论是在他沉思的时候，还是在同我的父亲或别人热烈地讨论重大问题的时候，每当我们向他招呼，他总是和颜悦色地同我们讲几句话。我们虽然是小孩子，然而我们都知道他是一个伟大的人。
    我记得在我们乡间的住所发生的一件事：孙先生以一种独特的神情，正在花园里走来走去，两手放在背后，低着头在沉思。那时我还很小，大约七、八岁。我正要跑过去同他招呼，忽然又停了下来。“不，”我对自己说，“最好不要打扰他；他也许正在思考很重要的事情。”于是我开始溜走。可是孙先生突然看到我了。他笑了一笑，停了下来，叫我过去，在我头上摸了一下，亲切地说了几句话。我清楚地记得那时的情景——午后的阳光照在孙先生的脸上，他的那套灰色的衣服，葱绿的树木——就如同昨天一样。
    我家里的人都喜爱孙先生，我们都觉得他是一个了不起的人物，他的革新中国的伟大计划终有一天会实现。他预见到并且警告我们说。前面有很多困难，成功是缓慢的；但是我们毫不怀疑他的理想最后总会胜利的；即使他自己可能亲眼看不到这一天。这就是为什么我们今天要聚集在这里，正如我的哥哥（海军上将柯林·康德黎爵士）和我有幸在1929年参加在南京举行的孙先生的国葬典礼一样。我们现在集会是要在他的诞辰九十周年之日，追念世界上最伟大的人物之一。
    我再没有要说的话了。
    我祝你们有和平有繁荣。
