    The first phase of construction of the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant has been completed. During the first phase of construction, by adopting the principle of building while producing, it has already manufactured excellent power generation equipment for ten hydroelectric power stations across the country. In addition, according to incomplete statistics, this factory has produced more than 240 types and thousands of pieces of motor products since it began production in 1952, supplying nearly two thousand factories, enterprises, and mines domestically.

    This factory was designed and built by China itself. In the process of building while producing, Chinese technicians also independently designed and manufactured 12,000 kW hydro-turbine generator units and other AC and DC motors. Self-designing and building factories, self-designing and manufacturing products, this may not be much in industrialized countries. But in China, especially in such a factory, which began construction in 1951 during the period of national economic recovery, it is a big deal that it can quickly manufacture products that meet modern requirements in just a few years. Zhu Renkan, the deputy chief engineer of this factory, said meaningfully that in the old China, even with patchwork efforts over decades, only small motors of several hundred kilowatts could be manufactured. But we have been able to make 5,000 kVA AC motors and 2,500 kW DC motors in just four or five years, and we are still trial-producing larger and larger hydro-turbine generator units. How can this not increase our confidence in accelerating socialist construction?

    When reporters visited this factory, they saw cranes hoisting and transporting generator castings weighing tens of tons back and forth in the hydro-turbine generator workshop. Next to the huge precision machines, young workers were skillfully processing parts for 15,000 kW hydro-turbine generators. According to the factory负责人, in recent years, the entire factory has basically mastered new technologies through technical education measures such as apprenticeship contracts, short-term training classes, and the method of learning by doing. The work efficiency and labor productivity of employees have significantly improved in recent years.

    What difficulties will be encountered in carrying out construction while producing and self-designing and self-producing in large-scale factories? And how are these difficulties resolved? The reporter specifically interviewed Wu Peilun, the deputy director of this factory, about this matter. He said that the first difficulty encountered was design. Due to the lack of technical talent, technical data, and experience, it was necessary to learn from Soviet materials while seeking advice from relevant domestic departments and Soviet experts whenever possible. After doing this, the main errors in the design were corrected in a timely manner, and the factory buildings were built to meet the requirements. The second difficulty was the heavy construction tasks, large investment, and long construction time, but the production tasks were urgent. In the face of this difficulty, the factory adopted the method of constructing while producing, and putting the main workshops into production in stages and batches. It is inevitable that there will be disorder in a workshop where both production and construction are carried out. This requires strengthening planning management and better arranging production and construction work through work plans. In addition, the factory immediately trial-produced 3,000 kW to 6,000 kW hydroelectric power generation equipment shortly after the construction and commissioning of the medium-sized factory buildings, which laid the foundation for the construction of large factory buildings and the trial production of 10,000 kW hydroelectric power generation equipment. Therefore, the difficulties were reduced when trial-producing 10,000 kW power generation equipment.

    Mastering new production technologies was a major problem faced by all newly built factories after they were put into production. The experience of the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant is that it is necessary to be good at learning and follow the mass line. When this factory began production, there were only two production designers for hydro-turbine generator equipment. However, because the technical personnel insisted on learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, mechanization and advanced operation methods were successively implemented in the manufacture of several components, so that the manufactured equipment was gradually improved to a modern level. When the product quality was not high, the entire factory launched a mass quality inspection movement and a mass technical learning activity, which gradually eliminated the phenomenon of large numbers of products being returned to the factory for repairs in the past.

    Now, the second phase of the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant is underway, and all production workers are also working enthusiastically. People have reason to believe that in the near future, they will make greater contributions in manufacturing internationally advanced modern large-scale power generation equipment.

    边建设边生产的哈尔滨电机厂
    新华社记者　章洛　吴建民
    哈尔滨电机厂第一期建设工程已经完成了。在第一期工程建设期中，由于采取了边建设边生产的方针，它已经为全国十个水力发电站制造了优良的发电设备。另外据不完全统计，这个工厂从1952年开始生产以来，到现在已经生产了二百四十多种、几千件电机产品，供应了国内近两千个工厂、企业和矿山。
    这个工厂是我国自己设计和建设的；在边建设边生产的过程中，也由我国技术人员自己设计和制造成功了一万二千瓩水轮发电机组以及其他交流、直流电机等产品。自行设计和建设工厂，自行设计和制造产品，这在工业发达的国家，原算不了什么。但是在中国，特别是在这样一个工厂，它是在1951年国家经济恢复时期开始建设的，它在短短的几年里就迅速地制造出符合现代化要求的产品，却是一件大事情。这个工厂的副主任工程师朱仁堪意味深长地说，在旧中国的几十年里，七拚八凑也只能制造几百瓩的小型电动机，可是我们仅仅用了四、五年时间，就能够做出五千千伏安的交流电机和二千五百瓩的直流电机，并且还在试制越来越大的大型水轮发电机组。这样，怎能不增加我们对加速建设社会主义的信心呢。
    当记者访问这座工厂的时候，在水轮发电机厂房里看到吊车正在装吊着几十吨重的发电机铸件，来回搬运。在巨大的精密机器旁边，年青的工人们正在熟练地加工着一万五千瓩的水轮发电机部件。据厂里的负责人说，几年来，全厂通过师徒合同、短期训练班等技术教育措施和边做边学的方法，数以千计的职工已经基本上掌握了新技术。职工们的工作效率和劳动生产率几年来已经有了显著提高。
    在大型工厂中进行边建设，边生产和自行设计、自行生产，将要碰到些什么困难？这些困难又如何解决的呢？记者为这件事专门访问了这个厂的副厂长吴佩纶。他说，首先碰到的是设计的困难。因为缺乏技术人才、技术资料和经验，这就需要一方面摸索着学习苏联资料，同时争取一切可能向国内有关部门和苏联专家请教。这样做了以后，才及时地纠正了设计的主要错误，把厂房合乎要求地建设起来。第二个困难是建厂任务重、投资大、建设时间长但生产任务紧迫。在这个困难面前，工厂采取了一面建设一面生产、主要车间分期分批地投入生产的办法。在一个车间既要生产又要建设，紊乱是难免的，这就要求加强计划管理，通过作业计划，更好地安排生产和建设工作。另外，工厂在中型厂房建成投入生产不久，就马上试制三千瓩到六千瓩的水力发电设备，这样就为大型厂房建成和试制一万瓩水力发电设备打下基础，因此在试制一万瓩发电设备的时候，困难也就减少了。
    掌握新的生产技术，曾经是所有新建工厂投入生产后所面临的主要问题。哈尔滨电机厂的体会是，要善于学习和走群众路线。这个工厂开始投入生产的时候，只有两个水轮发电机设备的生产设计人员。但是，由于技术人员坚持学习苏联的先进经验，在若干部件的制造方面先后实行了机械化和先进操作方法，因此使制造出来的设备逐步提高到现代化的水平。当产品质量不高的时候，全厂又掀起了群众性的质量检查运动和群众性的技术学习活动，使得过去大批产品退厂返修的现象逐渐消除。
    现在，哈尔滨电机厂第二期工程正在紧张进行，全厂生产职工也在热情地进行工作。人们有理由相信，他们在不久的将来，在制造国际水平的现代化大型发电设备方面，将会作出更大的贡献。
