    The Story of Chasing Bandits
    Original work by Yang Shangwu

    1. One day in 1951, three PLA soldiers who had lost contact while pursuing bandits were walking in the Gobi Desert. They had not eaten for three days and had not had water for five days. But they were still searching for the traces of the bandit leader Jin Zhizhong.
    2. Soldier Xiao Jiang could no longer walk due to bleeding, hunger, and thirst. Platoon leader Zhong Yongsheng went to find water and saw a small yellow mud depression ahead. He poked five feet deep with his bayonet, but did not see even a bit of wet soil.
    3. There was a pile of reeds in the distance. The platoon leader thought, "Where there is grass, there must be water." When he dug three feet deep, there was indeed wet soil, and the roots of the grass were moist. He really wanted to suck on them first, but he did not, and instead gave them to Xiao Jiang and soldier Li Yugen.
    4. After everyone sucked on the wet soil, their throats felt much better, and they continued to walk forward with difficulty.
    5. After walking for only half a mile, Xiao Jiang felt dizzy and lightheaded. The boundless desert was spinning, and his eyes were flashing. He fainted. Zhong Yongsheng hurriedly held Xiao Jiang in his arms and felt his pulse. Li Yugen stared at the platoon leader's face.
    6. Li Yugen discovered many animal skeletons not far away. These were left by businessmen or Tibetan people who died here on their way to Lhasa on a pilgrimage many years ago. He thought there might be carrying poles there. He went there and found a carrying pole. So he tore his cloth sheet into strips and twisted them into rope, and finally tied them into a stretcher.
    7. They carried the stretcher forward. Each step sank into a large sand pit. Sweat dripped from the tip of their noses. Every step required the strength of their entire bodies.
    8. Xiao Jiang woke up and found that he was being carried. He felt very sad. He thought: The platoon leader is also injured, and everyone has not eaten a grain of rice or drunk a mouthful of water for three or four days. Why add so much suffering to his comrades? So, while they were panting and stopping, he climbed out of the stretcher and staggered forward.

    追匪记
    原作　杨尚武
    画　陈兴华
    改编　缪波
    1、1951年的一天，戈壁滩上走着三个因追击土匪而失去联络的解放军战士。他们已经三天没吃东西，五天没喝到水了。但依然追寻着匪首金治中的踪迹。
    2、战士小姜因为流血和饥渴再也走不动了。班长钟永胜去找水源，看到前边有一片小黄泥洼地。他用刺刀戳了五尺深，连一点湿土也不见。
    3、远处有一堆芨芨草，班长想：有草定会有水。当他刨了三尺深的时候，果然有湿土了，草根上湿润润的。他真想先去吮一吮，但没有这样作，却让给了小姜和战士李玉根。
    4、大家吮了吮湿土以后，喉咙确实好受的多了，接着又艰难地向前走着。
    5、走了没半里路，小姜觉得头昏脑胀，无边的沙漠在旋转，眼里直冒火花，一下就昏倒了。钟永胜急忙把小姜抱在怀里摸着脉膊，李玉根凝视着班长的面孔。
    6、李玉根发现不远的地方有很多牲口的骨架，这不知是多少年前的生意人或藏民向拉萨朝圣时死在这里留下的。他想那里可能有杠架。走到那里果然找到一副杠架。于是他把自己的布单撕开拧成绳，最后捆成了一副担架。
    7、他们抬着担架往前走，一踩下去就是一个大砂窝，汗顺着鼻尖往下流，每走一步都得使着全身的力气。
    8、小姜苏醒过来，发现自己被抬着，心里非常难过，他想：班长也负了伤，大家三、四天没吃一粒米、未喝一口水了，为什么给自己的战友添这么多苦呢？他就趁他俩喘气停步的时候，爬出了担架，一颠一歪地向前走去。
                                        （未完，待续）
