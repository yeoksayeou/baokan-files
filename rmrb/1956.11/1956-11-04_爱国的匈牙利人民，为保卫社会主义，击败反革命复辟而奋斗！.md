    The situation in Hungary is currently in a state of serious chaos and danger. Despite being unable to even protect the security of its own Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Nagy government has not ceased its activities of betraying the socialist cause of Hungary and the interests of the Hungarian nation in both domestic and foreign policy. Nagy organized the government under the guise of a communist, and when he began to lead the government, he stated that he would be loyal to the socialist cause of Hungary. However, it now appears that this was merely a deception. Counter-revolutionary elements in Hungary are taking advantage of the chaotic situation under the Nagy government to resume their activities, establish parties and organizations under various names, and launch a frenzied attack on revolutionary forces. In many places, counter-revolutionary terrorists have attacked Communist Party organs and killed Communist Party members. Ferenc Nagy, the counter-revolutionary ringleader who fled abroad, and many other reactionary exiled politicians have rushed to Vienna or returned directly to Budapest to engage in conspiracies. Former Hungarian fascists with weapons are crossing the Austro-Hungarian border into Hungary in batches. At the same time, the US government, which has always openly advocated the subversion of socialist countries in Eastern Europe, is now "expressing respect" to Hungary in its time of terror, and has proposed providing the Nagy government with $20 million in material aid.
    The patriotic people of Hungary can now see clearly that although the counter-revolutionary terrorists also wave the banners of patriotism, independence, and freedom, they are by no means representatives of the Hungarian national interest. They are traitors to the Hungarian nation, and traitors to the great Hungarian patriots Kossuth and Petőfi. These counter-revolutionary elements are actually the direct successors of Horthy, who implemented fascist terror rule in Hungary from 1919 to 1944. During the period when imperialist forces overthrew the Hungarian Socialist Republic in 1919 and enabled Horthy to seize power, tens of thousands of Hungarian workers were massacred, 70,000 were arrested and imprisoned, and the Communist Party was forced to go underground. Horthy's reactionary rule not only impoverished Hungary, but also, by participating in Hitler's anti-Soviet war, almost completely destroyed the Hungarian army, and caused Hungary to be occupied by Hitler's troops in 1944. It was only due to the heroic advance of the Soviet army, and the active cooperation of the Hungarian Communists, other patriots, and the broad masses of the people with the Soviet army, that the Hungarian nation regained its independence and freedom. Can the patriotic people of Hungary forget this unforgettable and painful lesson? Can they regard the remnants of Horthy, who brought calamity to the country and the people, as patriots? Can they expect counter-revolutionary terrorists, who are as anti-communist and anti-Soviet as Horthy, who are prepared to massacre Hungarian workers in the same way, to overthrow the Hungarian socialist system in the same way, and to lead Hungary to destruction in the same way, to defend Hungary's independence and freedom? All patriots who can correctly judge the situation can easily recognize that only a socialist Hungary can defend its independence and freedom, realize its national interests, and enable Hungary to embark on the road of prosperity, wealth, and happiness. And a counter-revolutionary Hungary can only become a tool for Western imperialist elements to carry out new wars of aggression, and will repeat the tragic ending of Horthy's rule.
    The Hungarian people have already laid the foundation for socialism in the past eleven years. The Hungarian working class has eliminated the capitalist system of exploitation and become the leading class of the country. Hungarian peasants have obtained land from the landlords and are embarking on the road of agricultural collectivization. These fruits already achieved by the Hungarian working people are recorded in the People's Republic Constitution of 1949. The Constitution stipulates that the Hungarian People's Republic "protects the power and freedom of the Hungarian working people, safeguards the independence of the country, struggles against any form of exploitation, and organizes social forces to implement socialist construction." The Hungarian working people must not allow their fruits of struggle to be easily taken back by the counter-revolutionary adventurers who were originally overthrown and driven away. Therefore, the urgent task of the Hungarian working people and all true patriots at present is to immediately mobilize, use all possible conditions, unite all possible forces, seize the opportunity, overcome the counter-revolutionary danger, save the socialist cause of Hungary, and defend the independence and freedom of the People's Hungary.
    Recently, people have often compared the events in Hungary with the events in Poland. This is, of course, completely incorrect. Poland adheres to the socialist system, and continues to support the Warsaw Treaty, and continues to implement a policy of friendship with the Soviet Union. In Hungary, however, the counter-revolutionary forces are dominant, and the Nagy government has already announced its withdrawal from the Warsaw Treaty. The Polish United Workers' Party issued a declaration, pointing out that "the reactionary forces that dragged Hungary into disaster are resolutely condemned by Poland," and all socialists should adopt this attitude.
    The struggle of the Hungarian working people is not isolated and helpless. The working people of Hungary's neighboring countries have expressed close concern about the fate of the Hungarian people and the future of the Hungarian socialist cause. Public opinion in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia has pointed out the danger of counter-revolutionary restoration in Hungary, and has expressed support for the struggle of the Hungarian working people to defend the socialist cause. The Executive Committee of the Italian Communist Party specifically pointed out the necessity of the Soviet army remaining in Hungary at the present time, because otherwise it would inevitably lead to anarchy and white terror, and make Hungary a center for provoking peace in the entire European region. Similarly, our people, while supporting the Egyptian people, are also closely concerned about the struggle of the Hungarian people against counter-revolutionary restoration elements. The current situation in Hungary reminds our people of the situation after Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei betrayed the revolution in 1927. But the Hungarian people today are in a much more advantageous position than the Chinese people at that time. We believe that although the Hungarian people are temporarily encountering serious difficulties, they will surely find a way out of these difficulties and will achieve final victory.

### 爱国的匈牙利人民，为保卫社会主义，击败反革命复辟而奋斗！

    爱国的匈牙利人民，为保卫社会主义，击败反革命复辟而奋斗！
    匈牙利的局势目前正处在严重的混乱和危险中。纳吉政府尽管连自己外交部机关的安全都不能保护，却没有停止在内外政策方面对于匈牙利社会主义事业和匈牙利民族利益的背叛活动。纳吉是以共产主义者的身份组织政府的，在他开始领导政府职务的时候曾经表示他将忠于匈牙利的社会主义事业，但是现在看来，这只是一种欺骗。匈牙利的反革命分子利用纳吉政府下面的混乱局势恢复活动，成立各种名目的党派和组织，向革命力量进行疯狂的进攻。许多地方的反革命恐怖分子袭击共产党的机关，杀死共产党员。逃亡在国外的反革命魁首费伦茨·纳吉和其他许多反动的流亡政客，纷纷赶到维也纳或者直接回到布达佩斯进行阴谋活动。拿着武器的前匈牙利法西斯分子一批一批地越过奥匈边境而进入匈牙利。与此同时，从来公开主张颠复东欧各社会主义国家的美国政府，现在却向恐怖中的匈牙利“表示敬意”，并且提出要用两千万美元的物资援助纳吉政府。
    匈牙利爱国人民现在可以看明白：反革命恐怖分子虽然也打着爱国、独立、自由的旗帜，却决不是匈牙利民族利益的代表者。他们是匈牙利民族的叛徒，是匈牙利伟大爱国者柯树特和裴多斐的叛徒。这些反革命分子实际上是1919—1944年在匈牙利实行法西斯恐怖统治的霍尔第的直接继承人。在帝国主义势力推翻1919年匈牙利社会主义共和国而使霍尔第取得政权的期间，匈牙利几万工人遭受屠杀，七万人被捕下狱，共产党被迫转入地下。霍尔第的反动统治不但使匈牙利民穷财尽，而且由于参加希特勒的反苏战争，使匈牙利军队差不多全部复没，使匈牙利全国在1944年间被希特勒军队所占领。只是由于苏联军队的英勇进军，由于匈牙利共产党人、其他爱国分子和广大人民群众对于苏联军队的积极配合，匈牙利民族才重新获得独立和自由。匈牙利的爱国人民难道能忘记这一段记忆犹新的惨痛教训吗？难道能把祸国殃民的霍尔第的余孽看成是爱国者吗？难道能指望跟霍尔第同样反共反苏，准备同样屠杀匈牙利工人，同样推翻匈牙利社会主义制度，同样把匈牙利引向毁灭境地的反革命恐怖分子去保卫匈牙利的独立和自由吗？一切能够正确判断局势的爱国者都不难认识：只有社会主义的匈牙利，才能保卫自己的独立和自由，实现自己的民族利益，才能使匈牙利走上富强、繁荣、幸福的道路。而反革命的匈牙利，就只能成为西方帝国主义分子进行新的侵略战争的工具，就会重复霍尔第统治的悲惨结局。
    匈牙利人民在过去十一年中已经建立了社会主义的基础。匈牙利工人阶级已经消灭了资本家的剥削制度，成为国家的领导阶级。匈牙利农民已经从地主手中取得了土地，并且正在走上农业集体化的道路。匈牙利劳动人民所已经取得的这些果实记载在1949年的人民共和国宪法中。宪法规定匈牙利人民共和国“保护匈牙利劳动人民的政权和自由，维护国家的独立，与任何形式的剥削制度进行斗争，并组织社会力量实行社会主义建设。”匈牙利劳动人民决不能让自己的斗争果实，轻轻地被本来已经打倒了、赶跑了的反革命冒险家夺回去。因此，匈牙利劳动人民和全体真正爱国者当前的迫切任务，就是立即动员起来，利用一切可能利用的条件，联合一切可能联合的力量，抓紧时机，战胜反革命危险，挽救匈牙利的社会主义事业，保卫人民匈牙利的独立和自由。
    在最近期间，人们往往把匈牙利的事件同波兰的事件相提并论。这当然是完全不正确的。波兰坚持社会主义制度，并且继续拥护华沙条约，继续实行对苏友好的政策。而在匈牙利，反革命势力却占着优势，并且纳吉政府已经宣布退出华沙条约。波兰统一工人党发表宣言，指出“把匈牙利拖进浩劫的反动势力受到波兰坚决的谴责”，一切社会主义者都应当采取这个态度。
    匈牙利劳动人民的斗争不是孤立无援的。匈牙利邻近各国的劳动人民都对匈牙利人民的命运和匈牙利社会主义事业的前途表现了密切的关怀。苏联、捷克、波兰、南斯拉夫各国的舆论都指出了匈牙利的反革命复辟的危险，都表示支持匈牙利劳动人民保卫社会主义事业的斗争。意大利共产党执行委员会特别指出了苏联军队在目前时期留驻在匈牙利的必要性，因为否则就不可避免地引起无政府状态和白色恐怖，并且使匈牙利成为对整个欧洲地区的和平进行挑衅的中心。同样，我国人民在声援埃及人民的同时，也密切地关怀着匈牙利人民反对反革命复辟分子的斗争。匈牙利目前的局势使我国人民回想起1927年蒋介石、汪精卫背叛革命以后的局势。但是今天的匈牙利人民比当时中国人民的条件有利得多。我们相信，匈牙利人民虽然暂时遭遇着严重的困难，但是他们一定能够找到脱出这种困难的道路，并将取得最后的胜利。
