    Investigation and Research Must Be Realistic

    The "Dazhong Daily" of Shandong Province published an editorial on the 16th of this month, introducing the realistic investigation and research methods of Junan County in the province during the autumn agricultural cooperation movement. The title of the editorial is "A Noteworthy Method of Investigation and Research."

    The editorial detailed the work process of investigation and research. The main points are: Before the merger of cooperatives began this autumn, the Junan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) notified the district and township Party organizations to thoroughly understand the demands of the peasants for merging cooperatives. As a result, the Zhu Lu and Sang Zhuang districts, where the foundation of cooperation was relatively good, the CCP District Committee believed that large cooperatives should not be merged. The remaining fifteen CCP District Committees all reported that merging into large cooperatives was a universal demand of the peasants. According to the plans of various districts, the county's one thousand and nineteen agricultural cooperatives would be merged into about three hundred, with each cooperative having a scale of about five hundred households. The Junan County Committee of the CCP accepted the lessons of subjectivist errors in the spring work, and specially convened symposiums for district committee secretaries and township cadres, and also had individual talks with some cadres with a focus. After a series of work, problems were discovered. It turned out that some district and township cadres, after hearing about the merger of cooperatives, repeatedly inquired about the tone and framework from above, thinking that the larger the cooperatives were, the better, and that being small would be considered backward. Some township cadres were afraid that they would not be able to serve as township cadres after the township was merged, and wanted to merge into large cooperatives to become cadres of large cooperatives. Under the guidance of these ideas, many district and township cadres went down to "investigate and research" with a "the bigger the cooperatives, the better" mindset. Some district and township cadres even first talked about the superiority of large cooperatives at the meeting, and then asked everyone to discuss it. Based on this situation, the Junan County Committee of the CCP required district and township cadres to conduct objective and multi-faceted investigation and research on the one hand, and sent several main responsible cadres to go deep into the countryside for investigation and research on the other hand. As a result, the results of the investigation and research conducted by the county, districts, and townships separately were basically the same, and merging into large cooperatives was not a universal demand of the peasants. The opinions of the peasants were: the road of merging into large cooperatives is good, but the pace is too fast. However, some CCP District Committees believed that the peasants had no opinions of their own and would listen to whatever leadership they were given. The Junan County Committee of the CCP recognized that this opinion, which was contrary to the Party's mass line, represented the true thoughts of a large number of cadres. These cadres did not understand that investigation and research is to truly understand the opinions of the masses, and after analysis and research, to concentrate these opinions and form them into the opinions of the leadership, rather than imposing the opinions of the leadership on the masses. Therefore, the Junan County Committee of the CCP did not criticize these cadres, but instead sorted out, analyzed, criticized, and generalized the materials from various investigations, and used them to persuade and educate them. They finally understood the truth, and the ideological problems were basically resolved. Finally, based on investigation and research, the Junan County Committee of the CCP decided to merge only two hundred cooperatives in the county, and leave the rest untouched.

    Finally, the editorial pointed out that the realistic investigation and research methods of Junan County in the work of merging cooperatives are very good, and this method should be paid attention to in any work.

### 调查研究要实事求是

    调查研究要实事求是
    山东省“大众日报”在本月16日发表社论，介绍这个省莒南县在秋季农业合作化运动中实事求是的调查研究方法。社论的题目就是
  “一个值得注意的调查研究方法”。
    社论详细地介绍了调查研究的工作过程。主要是：今年秋季并社工作开始以前，中共莒南县委员会通知区、乡党委机关深入了解农民群众对于并社的要求。结果，全县合作化基础较好的朱芦、桑庄两个区，中共区委员会认为不能并大社，其余十五个中共区委员会都反映并大社是农民群众的普遍要求。各区规划加在一起，全县一千零一十九个农业社要合并成约三百个，每个社的规模是五百户左右。中共莒南县委员会接受春季工作中主观主义错误的教训，便专门召开了区委书记座谈会、乡干部座谈会，并且有重点地和一些干部作了个别谈话。经过一系列的工作，发现了问题。原来有些区、乡干部听说并社以后，一再探听上边的口气和框框，以为社并得越大越好，小了怕被说是落后。有些乡干部怕并乡以后不能再当乡干部，想并成大社当大社干部。在这种种思想指导下，许多区、乡干部就带着一个“社并得越大越好”的框子下去“调查研究”。有些区、乡干部下去以后，甚至先在会上讲大社的优越性，然后让大家来讨论。中共莒南县委员会根据这种情况，就一面要求区、乡干部客观地多方面地调查研究，一面派几个主要负责干部深入农村去调查研究。这样一来，县、区、乡分头调查研究的结果基本相同，并大社并不是农民群众的普遍要求。农民群众的意见是：并大社的道路是好的，就是步子走得太快了。但是，也有一部分中共区委员会认为农民群众没有主见，怎样领导怎样听。中共莒南县委员会认识到，这种和党的群众路线相违背的意见，代表了很大一部分干部的真实思想。这些干部不了解，调查研究就是要真正了解群众的意见，经过分析研究，把这些意见集中起来，形成为领导的意见，而不是把领导的意见强加给群众。因此，中共莒南县委员会不是去批评这些干部，而是把从各方面调查来的材料加以整理、分析、批判和概括，用来说服教育他们。他们也终于弄通了道理，思想问题基本上得到了解决。最后，中共莒南县委员会在调查研究的基础上，决定全县只合并二百个社，其余都不动。
    末了，社论指出，莒南县在并社工作上实事求是的调查研究方法很好，这种方法是在任何一项工作中都应当注意的。
