    Welcome Modern Translations of Ancient Philosophy Papers
    After reading Ren Jiyu's "Modern Translation of Fan Zhen's 'On the Extinction of the Soul'" published on page 7 of your newspaper on November 2nd, I felt it was very good. Many ancient Chinese philosophers have good works, but they are written in classical Chinese, which ordinary people cannot understand, and it is not easy to find these works. Therefore, I hope that newspapers can publish more modern translations of ancient Chinese philosophical papers in the future.

    欢迎古代哲学论文的今译
    11月2日你报第七版上发表的任继愈的“范缜‘神灭论’今译”我读后感觉很好。我国古代哲学家有许多好的著作，但用的都是古文，一般人读不懂，也不容易找到这些著作。所以希望报纸今后能多发表中国古代哲学论文的今译。
