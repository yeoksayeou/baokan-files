    Comrades:
    I speak here on behalf of the nation's workers and trade union organizations. We fully endorse our government's statement regarding the Anglo-French armed invasion of Egypt. The Anglo-French governments' invasion of Egypt has aroused the righteous indignation of millions of workers across the country. The workers at the Shanghai China Textile Machinery Plant, who are manufacturing textile machines for Egypt, said that we manufacture textile machines for Egypt hoping that the Egyptian people can live a peaceful and happy life, and we will never allow the Anglo-French governments to disrupt the Egyptian people's peaceful life. This voice of justice represents the firm will of millions of workers across the country.
    Not long ago, the Chinese trade unions welcomed worker representatives from Egypt and other Arab countries. We said to the Egyptian and Arab worker representatives that Chinese workers would certainly support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. I say it again here, all Chinese workers will unite with Asian and African workers, and together with peace-loving people around the world, resolutely support the Egyptian people and fight to stop the Anglo-French armed aggression. We will not allow the British and French imperialists to seize the Suez Canal from the Egyptian people; the Suez Canal will always belong to the Egyptian people.
    The struggle of the Egyptian people is just, and peace-loving people all over the world stand by the Egyptian people. The Egyptian people are sure to achieve final victory.

    中华全国总工会主席
    赖若愚的讲话
    同志们：
    我代表全国职工和工会组织在这里说话。我们完全拥护我国政府关于英法武装侵略埃及的声明。英、法政府对埃及进行侵略，已经引起全国千百万职工的义愤。正在为埃及制造织布机的上海中国纺织机械厂的工人们说，我们为埃及制造织布机，希望埃及人民过和平幸福的生活，我们决不容许英、法政府破坏埃及人民的和平生活。这种正义的声音，代表着全国千百万职工的坚决意志。
    中国工会不久以前欢迎过埃及和阿拉伯各国的工人代表，我们曾当着埃及和阿拉伯各国工人代表的面说过，中国职工一定支援埃及人民的正义斗争。我在这里再说一遍，中国全体职工将同亚非工人团结一致，和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，坚决支持埃及人民，为制止英法的武装侵略而进行斗争。我们不准许英法帝国主义者把苏伊士运河从埃及人民的手里抢走，苏伊士运河永远属于埃及人民。
    埃及人民的斗争是正义的，全世界爱好和平的人民站在埃及人民一边，埃及人民一定要取得最后的胜利。
