Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th -- Hong Kong news: The donations from people's organizations in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City to the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions to aid workers victimized in the Kowloon riots have been distributed by the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions' Committee for Relief and Assistance to Workers and Compatriots Victimized in the Kowloon Riots, starting on the 7th. Yesterday, twenty-nine workers who sustained serious and minor injuries received consolation money ranging from HK$300 to HK$3,000.

The workers who received the relief funds from the motherland's people were very excited. One worker, who was seriously injured and is still receiving treatment, said that although his injuries were severe, hearing about the enthusiastic support from compatriots in the motherland, coupled with the care and attention from fellow workers, even his pain was lessened, and his recovery was especially fast. A worker surnamed Lai, who was seriously injured, said: In this Tsuen Wan massacre created by Kuomintang secret agents, although many workers died and were injured, we feel infinite warmth and will never forget the atrocities of the secret agents because we have the love of all Hong Kong workers and the support of compatriots in the motherland. A worker surnamed Bai stated that he would do a better job of promoting the unity and welfare of Hong Kong and Kowloon workers as a repayment to Hong Kong and Kowloon workers and compatriots in the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th -- Hong Kong news: The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce sent representatives on the 7th to Tsuen Wan and Kowloon City, areas severely affected by the Kowloon riots, to express condolences to the victimized trade unions, workers' medical clinics, trade union welfare organizations, and shops.

When the representatives arrived in Tsuen Wan, they were jointly received by representatives from the Tsuen Wan Workers' Medical Clinic, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Silk Weaving Industry General Union, the Tsuen Wan Branch of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Enamelware Industry General Union, the Tsuen Wan Workers' Service Department of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Workers' General Union, and the Tsuen Wan Workers' Service Department of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Rubber and Plastics Industry General Union. They expressed their gratitude to the General Chamber of Commerce for their condolences. The workers' representatives said that although they had suffered trauma, the condolences and support came from all directions, making them feel warm and more confident. In their conversation, the representatives of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the workers' representatives mentioned that the Kuomintang secret agents created this inhuman atrocity, making more people recognize their hideous faces. They all expressed that they would unite even more closely in the future.

The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce also sent letters on the 7th to various victimized units in the Kowloon riots to express condolences, and announced that they had sent a letter to the Hong Kong British authorities, requesting severe sanctions against the rioters so that the lives and property of residents would be effectively protected in the future.
