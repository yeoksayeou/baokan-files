Visiting Han Qixiang in Yan'an
Shen Hui

One afternoon in July, in the courtyard of a guest house in Yan'an, the writers' and artists' delegation met with folk artist and vice chairman of the Chinese Balladry Research Association, Comrade Han Qixiang.

To welcome the visiting guests, Han Qixiang, holding a sanxian (three-stringed plucked instrument) and wearing clappers on his feet, performed moving songs for us. "The Great Victory of Yichuan" sang of the Shaanxi people's love for Chairman Mao and "Old General" Peng. "Liu Qiao's Reunion" sang of the tragic situation of women in the old society and their joy at liberation in the new society. He also sang the words in his heart: "Magpies chirp, welcoming writers and artists from Beijing. Asking me why I haven't created much in recent years, it's because there's rarely anyone to help me..."

Han Qixiang often thinks of the many comrades and literary and art workers who once worked in Yan'an. The arrival of the writers' and artists' delegation brought back many memories for him. He talked about how he was despised and humiliated in the old society. Since the arrival of the Communist Party, he had been liberated and participated in the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers. The "Liu Qiao's Reunion" he wrote received praise from the masses and literary and art workers, which made him feel unparalleled glory. How could he forget the people who helped him to be liberated?

Despite the difficulties of his blindness, Han Qixiang strives to work for the Party. In addition to going deep into the countryside for propaganda, he also experiences life in the countryside and collects a lot of material. He wants to write about the changes in the countryside in recent years.

He honorably joined the Communist Party of China in 1955. Recalling his joining the Party, he said: "I wanted to join the Party led by Chairman Mao a long time ago. If I joined the Party, I couldn't do other work, but I could sing for the Party and the people. The Party accepted my request as a blind person and approved my joining the Party. After receiving the notice of approval, I was so happy that I couldn't sleep all night. I got up and picked up my stringed instrument to sing. What else could I do besides singing? I think I should work for the Party wholeheartedly in the future and contribute everything to the Party. I want to sing more and create more."

Comrade Han Qixiang is now working in the Yan'an Cultural Center. It is difficult for the Cultural Center to help him with his creation, both in terms of manpower and resources. After the Shaanxi Federation of Literary and Art Circles was abolished, even fewer people helped him. He had someone record his creations "Three Months After Joining the Cooperative," "Three Days After Joining the Cooperative," and "Zhang Jingcai" and send them to "Shaanxi Literature and Art," which then forwarded these manuscripts to the Xi'an People's Publishing House, but there has been no news to this day. He also wants to write his "Account of Liberation" and his experiences of life in the countryside in recent years.

Han Qixiang told us about his requests, he said: "I am blind, and I am particularly concerned about the problems of the blind. There are now 560 blind people in northern Shaanxi, 80 percent of whom can speak and sing. There are many people like Li Youyuan, who wrote "The East is Red". Zhou Yongfu of the Yan'an Song and Dance Troupe has composed "Red Guards", and Zhang Wanbao of Yulin has composed many Shuntian You, and also composed "Fighting the Flood". These people are also not being taken care of. If someone helps them, they will create good things." Han Qixiang also has criticisms and suggestions for literary and art work. He said: "I feel that the government only pays attention to large forms of literary and art, and not to small forms. Large forms of film and drama are taken care of, but storytelling has not been asked about until now." He also told us: "I hope you will reflect to the higher authorities when you go back, and don't give up helping the literary and art work in northern Shaanxi. We must find ways for blind artists, run schools for the blind, let them study, study well and work well, and solve their livelihood problems. They are now performing on the streets of the city, and the police come to drive them away, saying that they are obstructing traffic; in the countryside, the cadres come to interfere, saying that they are obstructing production, so that some of them have returned to fortune-telling to make a living." Speaking of this, Han Qixiang expressed great heartache.

This folk artist spoke to us with fervent enthusiasm and earnest words about everything. He was so concerned about folk art and so concerned about his fellow artists. In fact, his own life is not good enough, and he also has difficulties in his work, but he puts them in a secondary position. We were deeply moved. We are willing to help him and willing to tell what he said to those who care about him.

    在延安访韩起祥
    沈慧
    七月的一个下午，在延安的一个招待所的庭院里，作家、艺术家参观团同民间艺术家、中国曲艺研究会副主席韩起祥同志会了面。
    韩起祥为了欢迎来访问的客人，他手抱着三弦琴，脚蹬着拍板，为我们表演了动人的歌曲。“宜川大胜利”唱出了陕北人民对毛主席、彭“老总”的热爱。“刘巧团圆”唱出了妇女在旧社会的悲惨境遇和在新社会翻身的喜悦。他也唱出了他自己的内心里的话：“喜鹊叫喳喳，欢迎北京来的作家、艺术家。问我这几年为啥不创作，苦的是没有人常常帮助咱……”
    韩起祥时常想念曾经在延安工作过的许多同志和文艺工作者们。由于作家、艺术家参观团的到来，更引起了他很多的回忆。他谈起在旧社会里怎样被贱视，受侮辱。自从来了共产党，他翻了身，参加了全国文学艺术工作者代表大会。他编的“刘巧团圆”受到了群众和文艺工作者的赞扬，使他感到了无上的荣耀。他怎能把帮他翻身的人忘怀了呢？
    韩起祥不顾自己双目失明的困难，努力为党工作。他除了深入到农村进行宣传以外，他还在农村中体验生活，搜集了很多材料。他想把近几年农村中的变化写出来。
    他于1955年光荣地参加了中国共产党。他回忆他入党的经过说：“我很早就想参加毛主席领导的党，加入了党不能作别的工作，我可以歌唱党，歌唱人民。党接受了我这个没有眼睛的人的要求，批准了我入党。我接到被批准入党的通知以后，喜欢得一夜也没睡。我起来拿起弦子来歌唱，除了歌唱我还能做什么？我想今后更要一心一意地为党工作，把自己的一切贡献给党。我要多多歌唱，我要多多创作。”
    韩起祥同志现在在延安文化馆工作，文化馆要帮助他创作，从人力物力上来说，都是有困难的。陕西文联取消了以后，更没有人帮助他。他曾找人把创作的“出社三个月” “入社三天”和“张敬财”记录下来送给“陕西文艺”，“陕西文艺”又把这几篇稿子转给西安人民出版社，至今没有消息。他还想写出他的“翻身记”和这几年在农村体验的生活。
    韩起祥对我们谈出了他的要求，他说：“我是个盲人，特别关心盲人的问题。现在陕北有盲人五百六十名，其中百分之八十能说能唱，像写“东方红”的李有源那样的人很多。延安歌舞团的周永福编有“赤卫军”，榆林的张万宝，编了很多顺天游，还编了一个“向洪水作斗争”。这些人同样是没人管的。如果有人帮助他们，他们会创作出好东西来的。”韩起祥对于文艺工作也有批评和建议。他说：“我感觉到政府对于文艺事业，只注重大形式，不注重小形式。大形式的电影、戏剧是有人管的，说书直到现在还没人来问。”他又告诉我们：“希望你们回去向上级反映，千万别放弃了对陕北文艺工作的帮助。要给盲艺人想办法，办盲人学校，让他们学习，学习好了好工作，并且解决他们的生活问题。他们现在在城市街头演出，警察来赶，说是妨碍交通；在农村演出干部来干涉，说是妨碍生产，弄得他们有的又恢复了算卦维持生活。”说到这里韩起祥表示非常痛心。
    这位民间艺人以火热的心情和恳切的语句同我们谈了一切，他是那样地对民间文艺关心，那样地对同行的艺人关心。其实他自己的生活也不够好，工作也有困难，他都放在次要的地位了。我们深深地受了感动。我们愿意帮助他，愿意把他说的话告诉关心他的人。
