Commercial Institutions Should Be Streamlined
Lin Wei

"Fly-Swatting Cadres"

    In April of this year, Huixian County in northern Henan established a retail department of an aquatic products company, which was then abolished in August of this year. The reason for the abolition was too little business. According to the Huixian County Party Committee, this retail department had three cadres, but they could only sell two yuan worth of goods in a month. With nothing to do, they spent all day swatting flies and were once called "fly-swatting cadres." The reason for the lack of business is that few people in the northern rural areas eat fish and shrimp. As for high-end seafood such as sea cucumbers and shark fins, no one even asked about them. It can be said that the three cadres were basically squatting there for four or five months for nothing.

    Talking about such a thing seems insignificant: a newly established department that is not familiar with market needs and brings in some materials that cannot be sold locally, is there anything to be surprised about? Wouldn't it be over if it were relocated elsewhere?

    Talking about this one thing (or a few things) alone, it can indeed be said like this. But linked to this matter is a very large and common problem—the widespread "downward extension" and "single-line operation" of many specialized commercial institutions in the past two years, especially this year. Even if subjectivist errors do not occur in the allocation of goods, there are still many issues that need to be thoroughly considered.

The Reality of Single-Line Operation

    Take the coal and construction company established in Huixian County in the second quarter of this year as an example. Before the establishment of the coal and construction company, coal was managed by the supply and marketing cooperative. The supply and marketing cooperative system in Huixian County, in addition to the county cooperative, also had eighteen grassroots cooperatives and sixty distribution outlets, a total of seventy-eight points selling coal at the same time, making it relatively convenient for farmers to buy coal. Starting from the second quarter, these seventy-eight points handed over the business of selling coal to the newly built twelve points of the coal and construction company. At this time, it became very inconvenient for farmers in various villages to buy coal, and some villages had to travel forty or fifty li to buy coal. As a result, complaints arose everywhere. Due to the inconvenience of buying coal, farmers tried to replace coal with other fuels as much as possible, resulting in a sharp decline in coal consumption and sluggish business for the company. In the past, the county supply and marketing cooperative only had one person wholesaling coal, but now a specialized company has been added, with a dozen or so cadres, but the result is that the state has coal that cannot be sold, and it is difficult for the masses to buy. Later, unable to continue, it was decided that the supply and marketing cooperative would sell coal again. Now some of it has been handed back.

    The situation of the timber company established in the second quarter of this year is not much better either. In the past, the county supply and marketing cooperative also managed this business, with four cadres being sufficient. Now the timber company has twelve cadres, but the turnover is less than in the past (last year, the supply and marketing cooperative's monthly purchase and supply of timber was 12,000 yuan, while this year, the timber company's monthly purchase and supply from April to August was 5,782 yuan, a decrease of more than half). The reason for the decrease is that there are no grassroots organizations below, making it very inconvenient for the masses to sell timber. Now it has been changed back to the supply and marketing cooperative for collection.

    The food company also once wanted to operate in a straight line to the end (to the masses). However, it is hard to imagine asking rural women to run dozens of li to find the food company to sell a few eggs. The result, of course, would be that most of the eggs would be eaten by the chicken farmers themselves, reducing the number of chickens raised. The company failed to complete its purchase tasks, and after a few days, it couldn't continue and closed down, handing it over to the supply and marketing cooperative.

    Huixian County has not established a professional oil and fat company, and the oil and fat business is still managed by the supply and marketing cooperative. However, Xinxiang County, forty li away from Huixian County, has already established a professional oil and fat company. According to the Xinxiang County Governor, the experience of the past year has proven that the premature downward extension of professional oil and fat institutions is not of much benefit, and may even be harmful. Before the establishment of the oil and fat company, the purchase of oilseeds, processing, and selling of oil were all managed by the supply and marketing cooperative. This county's supply and marketing cooperative had eleven grassroots cooperatives and seventy-plus distribution outlets, a total of more than eighty business points. In addition to purchasing cotton, they also organized the masses to gin cotton and use cottonseed to extract oil (good cottonseeds were used as seeds). Xinxiang County is a cotton-producing area, and many cotton farmers gin their own cotton and sell cottonseed. More people want to exchange their own oilseed rations (3.5 jin of oilseeds retained per person per year) for oil. In the past, farmers could conveniently sell their cottonseed to the supply and marketing cooperative in their village and township at any time, and at the same time exchange it for oil to eat, or buy back cloth or other things, without wasting any time. After the establishment of the oil and fat company, it was said that the oilseeds were to be purchased by the oil and fat company. However, this company only has two business points, which is impossible. The actual situation is that the oil and fat company only purchases peanuts, sesame, and hemp seeds. Cottonseed is purchased by the grain bureau (the grain bureau has ten business points in the county). However, the grain bureau only accepts grades below five, and grades above five are to be purchased by the purchasing bureau (which has ten purchasing stations below). As a result, the following situation occurred: farmers took cottonseed and ran several li to the oil and fat company to sell, but it was not accepted; then they ran several li to the grain company to sell, but it was not accepted, saying that it was above grade five; finally, they ran several li to the purchasing bureau (station) to sell. It was good if they sold it here; sometimes, the purchasing bureau (station) would not accept it either, saying that it was below grade five. What grade is it exactly? It's unclear. Farmers could not sell the cottonseed they were holding and were very angry. They complained all the way: "Carrying a pig's head but unable to find the temple gate, what kind of system is this!" The Zhaipo Township Agricultural Cooperative had more than 5,000 jin of bad cottonseed. In the past, it would have been sold to the village supply and marketing cooperative. Now it has to be sent to Dazhaoying Township, seven or eight li away, to be sold to the grain bureau. However, after it was delivered, the oil and fat company cadres living in the bureau said that it had to be sent to Xinxiang City, more than twenty li away, otherwise they would not buy it. In this way, the foot price simply exceeded the selling price. The farmers were angry and pulled it back home to prepare for composting, not selling it.

    The Xinxiang County Oil and Fat Company has thirty-six people, all of whom were added to strengthen this specialty. But the result is that things are more difficult to handle: the state cannot collect oilseeds, and farmers cannot sell oilseeds. (Or, more scientifically speaking: buying and selling oilseeds has become more difficult.) Seven of Xinxiang County's eleven grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives have no oil to sell, which is said to be largely related to the above situation.

Caused by the Downward Extension of the Purchasing System

    The situation of the Purchasing Bureau is similar. The Purchasing Bureau is responsible for purchasing five kinds of materials: cotton, hemp, tobacco, tea, and animal products, mainly cotton (other materials are rarely available here). This work is highly seasonal, with only three or four months of work per year. In the past, it was managed by the supply and marketing cooperative. Usually, everyone did other business, and when the cotton purchasing season came, they concentrated their efforts on purchasing cotton. The work was quick. After finishing, they immediately did other things, and there was no idle labor. After agricultural cooperation, cotton was not collected household by household in small packages, but agricultural cooperatives pulled it in whole carts, weighed it in whole carts, which was several times faster than in the past. Even if cotton production increased a lot, the supply and marketing cooperative could still cope. In fact, cotton production did not increase very much, and even if the supply and marketing cooperative added people, it would not need to add many.

    The professional purchasing bureau seems to be larger than the specialized commercial institutions in the commercial sector. In the Xinxiang area, the fourteen counties have a total of 1,314 staff members, averaging nearly 100 people per county. Xinxiang County has 230 people. With such a large professional institution, is the cotton purchasing work done better? Is it faster for the masses to sell cotton? No. On the contrary. Xinxiang's important cotton-producing area, Qiliying Township (including several villages), had four stations for collecting cotton last year, but this year three stations were reduced, leaving one station. Xingning Township had two stations collecting cotton last year, but this year one station was also reduced. As a result, farmers have to travel many roads to deliver cotton. Good seed cotton must be sent directly to Xiaoji Township (where there is a large processing plant) more than twenty miles away. The Niurenwang Agricultural Cooperative in Xingning Township planted 8,000 mu of cotton this year and needs to sell 1.6 million jin of good seed cotton. The entire village mobilized sixteen large carts and forty-eight livestock to continuously send it to Xiaoji, which would take more than a hundred days to complete. What about autumn planting and winter farming? As for farmers having to run twenty or thirty li to another village (Dazhaoying) to collect money after selling cotton, this trouble need not be mentioned.

Are There Too Many or Too Few Specialized Institutions?

    The many problems mentioned above seem to boil down to one point - the specialized system institutions and staff are still too few to meet the needs of actual work. People may well ask: if each specialized system establishes a ubiquitous grassroots institution like the supply and marketing cooperative, establishes hundreds of business points in each county, employs the same number of staff, and becomes more than a dozen sets of parallel and complete systems, wouldn't the problem be solved? Yes, this is indeed a thorough solution. But there is a big contradiction - if the increase in production and consumption is one or twenty percent (this hypothetical number is close to the facts), while the increase in commercial institutions and commercial staff is one or two thousand percent, is this reasonable? According to Xinxiang Prefecture statistics, the total number of people eating public grain in the fourteen counties' supply and marketing cooperatives plus their grassroots institutions is now 6,394. Assuming that there are ten specialized systems, if each system has as many institutions and personnel as the supply and marketing cooperative, then 63,940 people would be eating public grain. This number is terrifying.

What Role Do County Wholesale Institutions Play?

    Reassigning many rural grassroots purchase and sales businesses to the supply and marketing cooperative is, from the current point of view, the inevitable result of the development of things. However, the specialized wholesale institutions (some called companies, some called bureaus) "extended" from above to the county level still continue to exist. Take Huixian County as an example. Huixian now has seven specialized county-level wholesale institutions, including coal construction, timber, food, salt, department stores, textiles (mainly cloth), and knitwear, with a total of 114 fixed cadres, as well as an unequal number of employees, who actually enjoy almost the same treatment, only not cadres in name. The food company alone regularly has thirty-three such employees, whose task is to escort cattle, sheep, pigs, etc. These seven systems' wholesale business was previously undertaken by the county supply and marketing cooperative (the heavy tasks of purchasing cotton, tobacco, hemp, and livestock products, which are now undertaken by the 73 people in the county purchasing bureau, were also all undertaken by the county supply and marketing cooperative), while at that time the entire county supply and marketing cooperative only had 110 people. Now the number of staff in the county supply and marketing cooperative has increased, and the overall task of purchasing and supplying has not changed much, but seven parallel wholesale institutions and a large purchasing institution have been added.

    With so many wholesale institutions, has the wholesale work been accelerated or improved? It is enough to give an example of salt. Before the establishment of the county salt company (perhaps called the salt affairs bureau), the county supply and marketing cooperative was responsible for the wholesale of salt. The county cooperative bought a large batch of salt from the prefecture wholesale institution (located in Xinxiang) or other institutions, and immediately notified the grassroots cooperatives to prepare warehouses, prepare people and vehicles, and go to the Luwangfen station in the east of Huixian City to transport the salt. As soon as the train arrived, everyone immediately distributed it, and it was done in one go. What about now? In addition to a small portion of salt that can be directly transferred from the station after booking, the salt company has to prepare its own warehouses and employ people to store it, waiting for the grassroots cooperatives to buy it in batches and resell it to the masses. Isn't this an extra step for no reason, adding some costs for circulation and storage? To save this step, you can only discuss it with the county supply and marketing cooperative in advance, and the county supply and marketing cooperative will inform its subordinate grassroots cooperatives, and everyone will go directly to the station to transport salt when the time comes. But if this is the case, then why set up such an institution as the salt company?

    The situation and problems in other specialties are similar.

Views of Some Leading Comrades in Xinxiang Area

    Regarding this issue, at the beginning of November, I spoke with the Xinxiang Prefectural Party Committee Secretary and several county Party committee secretaries in the Xinxiang area, who were attending a meeting of the Henan Provincial Party Committee. Later, I also spoke with the Xinxiang County Governor and several county Party committees in Huixian County. Everyone unanimously felt that the downward extension of many professional institutions to the county is a waste and has other disadvantages. The Huixian County Party Committee Secretary gave an example: the Bobi Township grassroots supply and marketing cooperative bought hemp in its township, and in the past, it only needed to report to the county cooperative. Now the county cooperative has to transfer the procedures to the purchasing bureau, and the purchasing bureau neither wholesales nor retails, but only transfers it to the department store company, and the department store company transfers it back to the supply and marketing cooperative. The hemp did not move in Bobi, but the selling price increased by 40%. This is obviously harmful and useless to both producers and consumers. The Jixian County Party Committee Secretary also gave a similar example of the situation of purchasing and selling cowhide in Jixian County.

    Regarding the purchasing bureau, the Wenxian County Party Committee Secretary said: there are only three or four months of work a year. In the remaining eight or nine months, they have nothing to do, so they go to check the cotton pre-purchase contract to see if cotton has been planted and whether it is growing well, and sometimes they issue forms to investigate how many times the cotton has been hoed, whether topdressing has been applied, and whether it has been pruned. These are not things that they must do, and even if they don't take care of them, others will, and their management will only cause trouble for everyone.

    Comrade Wang Qingfeng, director of the Henan Provincial Purchasing Department Office, did not deny these facts either. He also told me that the purchasing institutions in Xinyang and Nanyang areas have even less work because there is very little cotton, hemp, and tobacco there. Comrade Shi Yupu, Deputy Director of the Henan Provincial Department of Commerce, also said to me when talking about the aquatic products company that this company is "too large and unreasonable." He said: "Let the fishmongers directly wholesale goods to the fish farms, why go through the aquatic products company?"

    Since it is unreasonable, why did it become like this? There is a common view in everyone's talks that when each system was making long-term plans, it was divorced from the current actual production and consumption levels in rural areas. Seeing what institutions the central government has and what institutions the province has, they believe that the prefecture, county, and even the countryside need what institutions, so-called "the sparrow is small, but it has all the vital organs." As a result, those who did not have county institutions set up county institutions one after another, and those who had county institutions stepped up the establishment of rural institutions. A section of three people became a bureau of thirty people, and a bureau of three sections became a bureau of five or six sections. Sections stepped up the establishment of shares, and shares added people one after another. Institutions and personnel rapidly expanded in this blind expansion competition. Huixian originally had more than 500 cadres, but now there are more than 1,800, and it is said that according to the plans of various systems, there are 2,600 or 2,700 people.

What To Do

    What to do? The common opinion of the Party and government organs in the Xinxiang area is to engage in comprehensive stores. Whether it is called a supply and marketing cooperative or a state-owned store (or what company), the practice must be to both purchase and supply. In addition to supplying department stores and cloth, it also supplies oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, Beijing and Guangxi groceries; in addition to purchasing waste copper, scrap iron, and small local products (as the current supply and marketing cooperative does), it also purchases cotton, hemp, eggs, peanuts, and medicinal materials. The goal should be to have one or two commercial institutions (more people are also possible) in a village to buy back what farmers want to sell and sell what farmers want to buy, which is convenient for serving farmers, convenient for completing state tasks, and can save a lot of staff. As for the degree of integration, this needs to be carefully studied based on the actual situation. The general characteristics of rural areas in the north are: two or three hundred households, a thousand people, there are several kinds of materials to sell, and there are also several kinds of things to buy; the types are quite many, but the quantity of each type is very small. If each system comes to set up an institution, there will be nothing to do. If not? Farmers are very inconvenient, they will complain, and it will also affect production and consumption. Adapting to this situation, of course, there is only one way to operate comprehensively. Other methods are difficult to implement at present.

    Regarding the wholesale institutions of various systems at the county level and in large market towns, everyone believes that they are superfluous. The general opinion is to restore the previous method - the fourteen counties are all wholesaled by one or several general stations in the prefecture. All grassroots business units in the county are wholesaled by the county supply and marketing cooperative or another similar institution. This can not only accelerate the circulation of commodities but also save many wholesale institutions and personnel.

    This seems to have the suspicion of "reversing the car" - the more advanced society is, the more detailed the division of labor should be. But I think: if social productivity only develops to the first stage, and the division of labor in the commercial sector has exceeded the second and third stages, then this excessively detailed division of labor is not only not beneficial but also harmful; not only can it not promote the development of productivity, but it will also hinder the development of productivity. The preceding materials can all testify to this conclusion. Comrades who engage in commerce and purchasing in the province and prefecture told me that the original consideration was: the supply and marketing cooperative sometimes takes care of the center (such as purchasing cotton in the fourth quarter) and cannot take care of other things, fearing that it will delay things; but the facts have proven that the premature and widespread downward extension of professional institutions has not made the state's purchasing and sales tasks completed better, nor has it made farmers get more convenience, and the situation is the opposite.

    The Xinxiang County Governor told me: when the supply and marketing cooperative was originally responsible for the cotton purchasing task, there was a 5% handling fee. It is said that later, I don't know which agency calculated this handling fee and estimated that it was enough to support a professional system, so that's how it was done. I don't know if this is true. If it is true, I think there are two points worth considering: first, the state spends the same amount of money, but it is different for farmers: in the past, it was very convenient to sell products, but now it is very inconvenient. Second, if the state does not use this group of cadres in this position but uses them in other positions, perhaps they can do many things that benefit the country and the people, but now they cannot.

    These words may have deviations and errors, and I hope readers will correct them.

    商业机构应当精简
    林韦
    “打蝇干部”
    豫北辉县在今年4月设立了一个水产公司门市部，今年8月又撤销了。撤销的原因，是生意太少。据辉县县委谈，这个门市部有三个干部，但一个月只能卖二元钱的货。闲着没事作，成天打苍蝇，曾经被称作“打蝇干部”。生意少的原因，是北方农村很少有人吃鱼虾。至于海参、鱼翅之类的高级海味，更是无人问津。可以说，三个干部几乎是白白在那里蹲了四、五个月。
    谈这样一件事似乎意义不大：一个刚建立工作的新部门不熟悉市场需要，调来一些此地无销路的物资，这有什么值得大惊小怪的呢？重新调到别处不就完了么？
    单谈这一件事（或几件事），的确可以这样说。但与这件事相联结的却是一个很大很普遍的问题——商业方面的许多专业机构在二年来特别是今年来普遍“下伸”和“一条线经营”的问题。即使在调拨商品上不发生主观主义的错误，也还是有许多问题要作彻底的考虑。
    一条线经营实况
    以今年第二季度在辉县设立的煤建公司为例。煤建公司成立以前，煤炭由供销合作社经营。供销社系统在辉县除了县社，还有十八个基层社，六十个分销店，总共有七十八个点同时卖煤，农民买煤是比较方便的。从第二季度起，这七十八个点把卖煤的业务交给了煤建公司新建的十二个点。这时候，各村农民买煤就很不方便了，有的村要跑四、五十里才能买到煤。于是埋怨之声四起。买煤不便，农民就尽量用别的燃料来代替煤，结果是煤的消费大减，公司生意萧条。过去县供销社只有一个人批发煤，现在增加了一个专业公司，十来个干部，却是国家有煤卖不掉，群众要买很难找。后来实在干不下去，又决定由供销社卖煤。现在一部分已经又交过去了。
    今年第二季度建立的木材公司，情形也并不更好。过去县供销社兼营这项业务，有四个干部即可。现在木材公司有十二个干部，营业额却不如过去多（去年供销社每月在木材方面收购加供应是一万二千元，今年木材公司从4月到8月每月收购加供应是五千七百八十二元，减少一半还多。减少的原因，是下面没有基层组织，群众要卖木材很不方便。现在又改由供销社代收了。
    食品公司今年也曾经要直线经营到底（到群众）。可是，要让农妇们跑几十里路去找食品公司卖几个鸡蛋，这是很难想像的。结果当然会是鸡蛋多半由养鸡人自己吃了，养鸡的减少，公司完不成收购任务，搞了几天搞不下去，还是收了摊子，交给供销社了。
    辉县没有成立专业的油脂公司，油脂业务现在仍由供销社兼营。但与辉县相距四十里的新乡县已经成立了专业的油脂公司。据新乡县长谈，一年来的经验，证明油脂专业机构过早的下伸并无多大好处，甚至还有害处。在油脂公司成立以前，收购油料，加工，卖油，都由供销社经营。这个县的供销社下面有十一个基层社，七十多个分销店，一共八十多个营业点。它们除了收购棉花，还组织群众轧花，用棉籽榨油（好的棉籽作了种籽）。新乡县是产棉区，有许多棉农自己轧了花，拿棉籽出卖。更多的人要拿自用的油料（一人一年三斤半油的油料自留）去换油。在以前，农民随时可以把棉籽很方便地卖给本村本乡的供销社，同时换回油来吃，也可以买回布匹或其他东西，完全不要费什么时间。油脂公司成立了，说是油料归油脂公司收购。但这个公司只有二个营业点，办不到。实际情形是油脂公司只收购花生，芝麻，大麻子。棉籽则由粮食局收购（粮食局在全县有十个营业点）。但粮食局只收五级以下的，五级以上的要由采购局（下面有十个采购站）收购。结果就出现这样情形：农民拿了棉籽跑了若干里路到油脂公司去卖，不收；又跑若干里路找粮食公司去卖，也不收，说这是五级以上的；最后再跑若干里路到采购局（站）去卖。在这里卖掉了还算不错；有时候，采购局（站）也不收，说这是五级以下的。究竟是哪一级？弄不清。农民拿着棉籽卖不出，非常恼火。一路走一路埋怨：“提着猪头找不到庙门，这算什么制度呀！”翟坡乡农业社有五千多斤不好的棉籽，在往年，卖给本村供销社就完了。现在要送到七、八里外的大召营乡去卖给粮食局。但在送到以后，局内住着的油脂公司干部又说必须送到二十多里以外的新乡市，不然不肯买。这样，脚价简直超过了售价。农民生气，就拉回家去准备沤粪，不卖了。
    新乡县油脂公司有三十六人，都是为加强这项专业而增设的。但结果是事情更不好办了：国家要收油料收不起来，农民要卖油料卖不出去。（或者科学些说：买卖油料都增加了困难。）新乡县有十一个基层供销社，其中七个社没油可卖，据说和上述情况有很大关系。
    采购系统机构下伸所引起的
    采购局的情形也类似。采购局管的是收购棉、麻、烟、茶、畜产等五种物资，主要是购棉（其他物资这儿很少）。这工作有很大季节性，一年只三、四个月有事。过去由供销社经营，平时大家干别的业务，购棉季节到了就集中力量购棉。工作很快。干完了马上就干别的，并无窝工现象。农业合作化以后，收棉不是一户一户一小包一小包的收，而是农业社整车整车拉来，整车整车过磅，比过去快几倍。即使棉花增产很多，供销社也还是可以应付的。而事实上棉花增产并不很多，供销社就是添人，也添不了几个就行了。
    专业的采购局，似乎比商业方面的各专业公司机构都大。新乡地区十四个县，共有一千三百一十四个工作人员，每县平均近百人。新乡一县有二百三十人。有了这样庞大的专业机构，购棉工作是不是作得更好一些呢？群众售棉是不是更快一点呢？不然。而且适得其反。新乡重要产棉区七里营乡（包括若干村）去年有四个站收棉，今年减了三个站，剩了一个站。兴宁乡去年二个站收棉，今年也减了一个站。这一来，农民卖棉就必须跑许多路去送。良种的籽棉更必须直送二十多里以外的小冀乡（那里有大加工厂）。兴宁乡的牛仁旺农业社今年植棉八千亩，要卖一百六十万斤良种籽棉。全村动员十六辆大车，四十八头牲口不间断地往小冀送，也得送一百来天才能送完。秋种和冬耕怎办呢？至于农民卖了棉要跑二、三十里到另一村（大召营）取款，这麻烦就不必说了。
    专业机构是太多还是太少
    上面所说的许多问题，似乎可以归结到一点——各专业系统机构和工作人员仍然太少，不能满足实际工作的需要。人们很可能这样发问：每个专业系统都像供销社一样建立一套无所不在的基层机构，在每县成立成百个营业点，用上同样多的工作人员，成为十多套平行的完整的系统，问题不就解决了么？是的，这确实是彻底办法。但有一个很大的矛盾——生产消费的增加是百分之一、二十（这个假设数是接近事实的），商业机构和商业工作人员的增加是百分之一、二千，这难道是合理的么？新乡专区统计，十四个县的县供销社加上它们的基层机构，现在吃公粮人员的总数是六千三百九十四人。就按十个专业系统计算，如果每个系统都有供销社那么多的机构和人员，那就要有六万三千九百四十人吃公粮。这数目是很可怕的。
    县的批发机构起什么作用
    许多农村基层购销业务重新交给供销社，从现在看，是事情发展的必然结果。但是从上面“伸”到县级的各专业的批发机构（有的称公司，有的称局）还继续存在着。以辉县为例。辉县现在还有煤建、木材、食品、盐务、百货、纺织品（主要是布匹）、针织品等七个专业的县级批发机构，共有固定的干部一百一十四人，另外还有人数不等的雇员，实际上也享受着差不多同等的待遇，只是名义上不是干部罢了。仅食品公司就经常有三十三个这样的雇员，任务是赶送牛羊猪等。这七个系统的批发业务，以前都是县供销社担负（现在县采购局七十三人所担负的收购棉、烟、麻、畜产的繁重任务，以前也统由县供销社担负），而那时整个县供销社只有一百一十人。现在县供销社的人员增加了整个收购和供应的任务也并无很大变化，但却增加了七套并行的批发机构，一套很大的收购机构。
    有了许多批发机构，批发工作是否加快了或改善了呢？这只要举出食盐方面作例就够了。在县的盐业公司（也许是叫盐务局）成立以前，县供销社担任盐的批发。县社向专区批发机构（设在新乡）或其他机构买好了大批的盐，马上通知各基层社准备仓库，准备人和车，到辉县城东的潞王坟车站去运盐。火车一到，大家马上分配完毕，一道手就行了。现在呢？盐业公司除过预订的一小部分可以直接从车站转手以外，大部都要自己准备仓库，自己用人保存，等各基层社来成批买去，转卖群众。这不是无故多一层手，多一些流转和保管的费用么？要节省这层手续，只有事前和县供销社商量好，由县供销社转知所属各基层社，到时候都到车站直接运盐。可是如果这样，那又何必多设盐业公司这样一个机构呢？
    其他专业，情况和问题也类似。
    新乡地区一些领导同志的看法
    关于这个问题，11月初我同正在河南省委开会的新乡地委书记及新乡地区几个县委书记谈过一次。以后同新乡县长和辉县几个县委也谈过。大家都一致感觉到现在许多专业机构下伸到县是一种浪费，而且有其他害处。辉县县委书记举例说：薄壁镇基层供销社在本镇买了麻，从前只要报到县社就完了。现在县社还要转手续给采购局，采购局不批发也不零售，只是转批给百货公司，百货公司又批回供销社。麻在薄壁未动，售价就提高了40％。对于生产者和消费者，这显然都是有害无益的。汲县县委书记对于汲县收售牛皮的情形，也举出了同样的例子。
    关于采购局，温县县委书记的说法是：一年只有三、四个月工作。其余八、九个月时间没事作，就去检查一下棉花预购合同，看棉花种了没有，长得好不好，有时候就发表格来，调查棉花锄了几遍，上了追肥没有，打杈没有。这些都不是他们非干不可的事，他们不管也还有别人管，他们管了反而给大家添麻烦。
    河南省采购厅办公室主任王青锋同志也没有否定这些事实。他还告诉我，信阳、南阳地区采购机构工作更少，因为那里棉、麻、烟都很少。河南省商业厅副厅长石玉璞同志对我谈到水产公司时，也说这公司“机构太大，太不合理”。他说：“让鱼贩直接到鱼场批货就行了，何必再经水产公司这一道手？”
    既然不合理，为什么会成为这样的呢？大家的谈话中有一个共同的看法，就是各系统在长期规划的时候，脱离了当前农村的实际生产水平和消费水平，看中央有什么机构，省里有什么机构，就认为专区和县里以至乡村里都需要什么机构，所谓“麻雀虽小，五脏俱全”。于是，没有县机构的纷纷设立县机构，有了县机构的加紧建
  立乡村机构，三个人的科变成了三十个人的局，
  三个科的局变成了五、六个科的局，科下面加紧建股，股下面纷纷添人。机构和人事就在这种盲目的扩充竞赛中迅速地膨胀了。辉县原来干部有五百多人，现在成了一千八百多人，据说按各系统的规划是二千六、七百人。
                  怎么办
      怎么办呢？新乡地区党政机关的共同意见，是搞综合性商店。不管叫作供销社也好，叫作国营商店（或者什么公司）也好，反正作法必须是既收购，也供应。既供应百货、布匹，也供应油盐酱醋、京广杂货；既收购废铜烂铁、小土特产（像目前供销社所作的），也收购棉麻鸡蛋花生药材。目标应当是在一个乡村有一、二个商业机构（人多一点也可），就能把农民要卖的买回来，把农民要买的卖出去，既便于服务农民，也便于完成国家任务，工作人员也可以节约很多。至于综合到什么程度，这要根据实际情况详细研究。北方农村的一般特点是：二、三百户人家，千把人口，有若干种物资要出卖，也有若干种东西要购买；种类相当多，但每一类数量都很小。各系统都来设机构，就无事作。不设呢？农民很不方便，要埋怨，也会影响生产和消费。适应这种情况，当然只有综合经营一途。其他办法在目前都很难行通。
    关于县级的和大集镇上的各系统批发机构，大家认为是多余的。普遍的意见，是恢复从前的办法——十四个县都由专区的一个或几个总站批发。全县各基层营业单位统由县供销社或另外一个类似的机构批发。这样既可加速商品流转，也可节省许多批发机构和人员。
    这样作有点“开倒车”嫌疑——社会越进步，分工应当越细密。但是我以为：社会生产力如果只发展到第一阶段，而商业方面的分工已经超过第二、第三阶段，那么这样过分细密的分工就不但没有好处，反而有害处；不但不能促进生产力发展，还会阻碍生产力发展。前面的材料，都可以给这种论断作证。省和专区搞商业和采购的同志告诉我，原来的考虑是：供销社有时顾了中心（如第四季度购棉），顾不了其他，怕耽误事情；但事实证明专业机构过早地普遍下伸，并没有使国家购销任务完成得更好，也没有使农民得到更多的方便，而且情况是相反的。
    新乡县长告诉我：原来购棉任务由供销社负担时，里面有5％的手续费。据说后来不知哪个机关把这笔手续费一算，估计足够养一个专业系统，于是就这样作了。我不知道是否如此。如果属实，我以为有两点值得考虑：第一、国家花钱相等，但对农民却不一样：以前出售产品很方便，现在大大不方便了。第二、如果国家不把这批干部用在这个岗位，而用到其他岗位，也许他们可以作出许多福国利民的事，而现在却不能。
    这些话可能有偏差，有错误，希望读者指正。
