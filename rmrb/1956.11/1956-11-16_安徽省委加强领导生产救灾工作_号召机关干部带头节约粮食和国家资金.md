    Anhui Provincial Party Committee Strengthens Leadership in Production and Disaster Relief
    Calls on Government Cadres to Take the Lead in Conserving Grain and State Funds
    (Our Dispatch from Hefei, November 14th) The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently adopted important measures to strengthen leadership in production, disaster relief, and conservation. Two work teams and two work groups, comprising one hundred and ten people drawn from the directly affiliated organs of the Provincial Committee, have been dispatched to the disaster-stricken counties in the Fuyang and Bengbu Special Districts, and some disaster-stricken counties in the Wuhu Special District, respectively, to carry out work. These work teams and work groups are personally led by the ministers of the various departments of the Provincial Committee and the directors of government bureaus. Their tasks are to specifically assist the leading departments of the counties in the disaster areas in effectively leading the masses to do the following work well: First, mobilize and inspect the vegetable planting work of farmers in the disaster areas, mobilize the masses to use private plots to grow vegetables, borrow idle land from cooperatives in winter to grow vegetables, plant vegetables around houses, and intercrop vegetables in wheat fields. In the Huai River disaster area, each person should plant two fen of vegetables, and in the Yangtze River area, each person should plant one fen of vegetables; Second, mobilize the masses to dry vegetables, with each person in severely affected areas drying ten jin of dried vegetables, and each person in lightly affected areas drying fifteen jin of dried vegetables; Third, mobilize the masses to plant more early-maturing crops; Fourth, determine, inspect, and supervise the development of sideline production in the disaster areas. The work teams and work groups will also help various localities to do a good job in grain work, rectification of the cooperatives, and inspection of autumn planting. The winter water conservancy projects should be appropriately arranged according to the material and financial resources of the masses. The Provincial Committee requires the leading departments of the counties in the disaster areas and the work teams and groups to do the above work specifically and reliably with the spirit of disaster relief in 1954, in order to lay the foundation for weathering the famine, conserving national grain and funds, and launching large-scale production next spring.
    In order to support the disaster areas and national construction, the Provincial Committee has held several meetings, calling for a vigorous conservation movement, starting from the directly affiliated organs, requiring everyone to first conserve grain and state funds, and also advocating conservation for individual cadres. Now the directly affiliated organs of the province have universally carried out communication, and have begun to take conservation measures in capital construction and grain. This conservation movement will soon be launched throughout the province. (Yu Ming)

    本报合肥14日电　中共安徽省委最近采取重要措施，加强生产救灾和节约的领导工作。由省委直属机关抽调一百一十人组成的两个工作队和两个工作组，已分别到阜阳、蚌埠两专区各受灾县，及芜湖专区部分受灾县，去进行工作。这些工作队和工作组，由省委各部部长和政府厅长亲自领导。他们的任务是，具体帮助灾区各县的领导部门，确实领导群众作好以下工作：一、发动和检查灾区农民的种菜工作，要发动群众利用自留地种菜，借合作社冬闲地种菜，家前屋后种菜，在麦地里带种菜。沿淮灾区要作到每人种二分地的菜，沿江要作到每人种一分地的菜；二、要发动群众晒干菜，重灾区要每人晒十斤干菜，轻灾区要作到每人晒十五斤干菜；三、要发动群众多种早熟作物；四、确定检查督促灾区开展副业生产。工作队和工作组并且要帮助各地作好粮食工作，整社工作，检查秋种工作。对水利冬修则要根据群众物力财力作适当安排。省委要求灾区各县领导部门和工作队、组，要以1954年的救灾精神，具体可靠地作好以上工作，为度荒、节约国家粮食、资金，及明年春天开展大生产打下基础。
    为了支援灾区和国家建设，省委几次开会，号召从直属机关起，大力开展节约运动，要求大家首先节约粮食，节约国家资金，对于干部个人也提倡节约。现在省直属机关已经普遍进行传达，并开始在基本建设及粮食方面，采取节约措施。这一节约运动即将在全省开展起来。（于明）
