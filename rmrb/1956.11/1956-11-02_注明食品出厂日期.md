    Indicate the Production Date of Food Products
    In stores, people generally determine the production date of dairy products, canned goods, candies, biscuits, cigarettes, and various wines based on how new or old the trademark appears and the quality of the packaging. Newly produced products may be mistaken for old stock because the trademark is not clean, while old stock with a still-new trademark may be mistaken for new products. Whether food is fresh or spoiled is very important to people's health. Therefore, it is hoped that food factories will indicate the production date on the trademarks or packaging of various products, and indicate the shelf life for products with a limited time. Canned goods and dairy products should indicate the ingredients they contain. This can prevent stale food from entering the market and also facilitate consumers' selection. Wu Xiangting

    注明食品出厂日期
    店铺里卖的乳制品、罐头、糖果、饼干、香烟和各种酒，一般人都是根据商标的新旧，外形的好坏来断定产品的出厂日期的。新生产出来的产品因为商标不干净而当成陈货；陈货的商标尚新，也可能被认作是新产品。食品新鲜或变质，对人的健康有很大关系。所以希望食品工厂在各种产品的商标上或包装盒上注明出厂日期，有时间性的产品要注明保存期限；罐头、乳制品要注明所含成分。这样可以杜绝陈腐食品流入市场，也便利消费者选购。　吴香亭
