    Local Industry Cannot Be Separated from Local Needs
    Wang Xiuqing, Zhao Wenzheng
    In late October, we visited the local state-owned Linfen Machinery Factory and the joint state-private Taiji Iron Factory in Linfen.

    In these two factories, there were piles of unsold products and raw materials everywhere. The Taiji factory's site was already small, and with these unsold products and raw materials piled up, it seemed even smaller. It was inconvenient for workers to move around, and accidents involving falls and bumps occurred frequently. Wang Guangming, the secretary of the Party branch, said: "This factory has a history of more than thirty years. Before the joint state-private ownership, it mainly manufactured and repaired various agricultural tools: balers, cotton gins, noodle presses, and plowshares, which were sold throughout southern Shanxi. Many farmers would come to us with any work they needed, but now it's different. After the joint state-private ownership last year, the factory couldn't decide what work to do; the tasks were completely assigned by higher authorities. This year, the factory made 1,500 waterwheels, and 1,000 of them are piled up in the factory, unable to be sold. The value of the piled-up waterwheels and raw materials alone is 170,000 yuan, and we have been living on loans from April until now."

    The Linfen Machinery Factory is twice the size of the Taiji factory, with a total of 320 employees and relatively complete mechanical equipment. We originally thought the situation would be better than Taiji, but after we interviewed Comrade Su Zheng, the factory director, we found that the two factories were very similar. Director Su Zheng said: "We often have people but no goods, and goods but no people. On the one hand, we can't complete the plan. Even if we complete the plan, we can't sell the products. The value of the waterwheels and steam engines piled up in the factory is more than 200,000 yuan, and the value of the piled-up materials is also more than 200,000 yuan. In addition to occupying all the factory's working capital, we have also borrowed more than 200,000 yuan from the bank."

    Comrades from the Industry Department of the Jinan Prefectural Party Committee told us that 42 new and expanded local state-owned factories would be built in various counties this year. If they are not built, they will not be able to meet the needs of the growing agricultural production. However, after visiting these two factories, we felt that it was not a lack of industrial production, but a surplus of production without sales channels.

    What exactly is going on! To this end, we also went to the Rural Work Department of the Prefectural Party Committee, the Jinan Office of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the Handicraft Cooperative. The situation we learned here was the opposite of what we learned in the factories. The responsible comrade of the Production Materials Management Department of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative said: "This year, we actually supplied farmers with various means of production worth more than 29 million yuan, and the plan for next year is to increase by 20% compared to this year. This includes more than 25,000 sets of various power machines and new agricultural tools. Many of these things are purchased from all over the country. Although the Linfen Machinery Factory can manufacture hillside plows, we ordered 3,000 sets from them this year, but none had been produced by the end of September." Wang Xinlin, the chief of the Production Technology Guidance Section of the Handicraft Cooperative, said: "Many of the machines we needed this year have not materialized. After compression, we need at least 547,000 yuan worth of handicraft machinery next year, but we still can't order anything from there. This year, we have traveled all over the Northeast, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Xi'an to buy diesel engines and gas engines, and the travel expenses alone cost thousands of yuan." The Rural Work Department of the Prefectural Party Committee has even more grievances. Deputy Minister Dong Qing said: "At present, there are more than 20,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows, 1,471 seeders, and 2,000 diesel engines, coal gas engines, and other power machines in the rural areas of southern Shanxi. In addition, there are ten tractor stations, with a total of 363 standard machines. There are many agricultural machines, but there is nowhere to repair them when they break down. At present, 26 tractors in the district have been out of service for four months to more than a year. The parts of 31 machines are damaged. Because these machines cannot be repaired in time, more than 60,000 mu of land that could be cultivated by machines has not been cultivated. The gas engine of an agricultural cooperative in Xiangfen County broke down, and because it could not be repaired locally, it ran to a factory in Fujian to repair it. Therefore, the members of the agricultural cooperative generally reflected that agricultural machines are good, but there is nowhere to repair them when they break down. When they go to a factory, they all say they don't have time and can't take care of it." This situation is deeply felt even by the Linfen Machinery Factory and the Taiji Factory. As Director Su Zheng of the Linfen Machinery Factory said: "The factory's path is getting narrower and narrower. It is very difficult for us to ignore the agricultural cooperatives when they come to us, but what can we do? The tasks assigned by the higher authorities, can you say you won't complete them?"

    These facts show that there is a contradiction between the production tasks of local industry and the needs of the local people. Local industry should first meet the needs of local farmers and craftsmen. This is the established policy, and the First Congress of the Shanxi Provincial Party Representatives has also made a resolution on this. However, in actual implementation, this problem has not been solved. The leading organs of local industry in Shanxi Province often only focus on the whole province and the whole district, and rarely pay attention to the relationship between local industry and the production and life of the local people. They control the factories very tightly, and only assign them production tasks in batches and sets, and the factories have no autonomy. Some leading cadres in these factories are only willing to produce in batches, and are unwilling to do small jobs, believing that repairing and patching up has no future. In this way, the relationship between local industry and the local people has become estranged, the needs of the local people cannot be met, and the development of local industry is also affected. It is hoped that this issue will attract the attention of relevant departments.

    地方工业不能离开地方需要
    王秀清　赵文正
    10月下旬，我们在临汾访问了地方国营临汾机械厂和公私合营泰记铁工厂。
    这两个工厂里到处堆放着大量的产品和原材料。泰记工厂的场地本来不大，堆上这些卖不出的产品和原材料，就显得更加狭小了。工人们来往行走都不方便，时常发生跌摔碰伤事故。党支部书记王光明说：“这个工厂已有三十多年的厂史，公私合营以前，主要是制造和修理各种各样的农具：打包机、压花机、压面机以及犁铧等产品行销晋南各地。很多农民有了什么活都来找，可是现在不同了。去年公私合营后，做什么活，厂里做不了主，完全由上级统一分配任务。今年厂里做了一千五百部水车，就有一千部积压在厂里卖不出去，光积压的水车和原料就值十七万元，从4月至现在，一直在靠贷款过活。”
    临汾机械厂比泰记工厂大一倍，全厂共有三百二十名职工，各种机械设备比较齐全，原以为情况一定比泰记好些，但当我们访问了厂长苏政同志后，却发现两厂大同小异。苏政厂长说：“我们经常是有人没货，有货没人。一方面是完不成计划。完成了计划也推销不出去。现在厂里积压的水车、蒸汽机价值二十多万元，积压的材料也是二十多万元。除把厂里的全部流动资金占用之外，还向银行贷了二十多万元。”
    中共晋南地委工业部的同志向我们介绍情况时，曾说今年要在各县新建和扩建四十二个地方国营工厂。如果不建设就不能满足日益发展的农业生产的需要。而在访问了这两个工厂后，我们觉得似乎不是工业生产不足，而是生产有余，没有销路。
    这到底是怎么一回事！为此，我们又跑到地委农村工作部、供销社晋南办事处和手工业社。在这里同在工厂了解到的情况正相反。供销社生产资料经理部负责同志说：今年我们实际供应了农民各种生产资料达二千九百多万元，明年计划比今年增加20％。其中包括各种动力机器和新式农具二万五千多部。这些东西有很多是从全国各地采购的。临汾机械厂虽然能够制造山地犁；但我们今年与他们订购了三千部，到9月底一部也未出厂。手工业社生产技术指导科科长王新林同志说：“我们今年需要的很多机具落空了，经过压缩，明年最少需要五十四万七千元的手工业机械，至今那里也订不到货，今年为了买柴油机、煤气机曾跑遍了东北、上海、天津、西安等地，光路费就花了千、百元。”地委农村工作部更有满肚子的牢骚。副部长冬青同志说：“现在晋南农村有二万多部双轮双铧犁、一千四百七十一部播种机、二千来部柴油机、锅驼机等动力机器，另外还有十个拖拉机站，共计三百六十三部标准机台。农业机械很多，就是坏了没处修理。现在全区已有二十六台拖拉机停车四个月至一年以上。有三十一台的零件损坏了。因为这些机器不能及时修理，有六万余亩能用机器耕种的土地没有耕种。襄汾县一个农业社的煤气机坏了，因当地不给修理，曾跑到福建一个工厂去修理。因此，农业社社员普遍反映，农业机器好是好，就是坏了没处修。走到那个工厂都说没时间，顾不上。”这种情况，就连临汾机械厂和泰记工厂也是深深体会到的。正如临汾机械厂厂长苏政同志所说：“工厂的路子愈走愈窄，农业社来找我们，我们不理也很难过，但有什么办法呢？上级给分配的任务，你能说不完成吗？”
    这些事实说明地方工业的生产任务同当地人民的需要之间存在着矛盾。地方工业应当首先满足当地农民和手工业者的需要，这是既定的方针，山西省第一次党代表大会也就此作了决议。但在实际执行中，这个问题却没有解决。山西省地方工业的领导机关往往只就全省、全区着眼，而很少注意到地方工业与当地人民的生产和生活的关系。他们对工厂卡的很死，只是给他们成批成套的分配生产任务，厂内没有自治权。这些工厂某些领导干部也只愿成批生产，不愿做小量活件，认为修修补补，没有前途。这样，地方工业同当地人民的关系反而疏远了，当地人民的需要不能满足，地方工业的发展也受到影响，这个问题希望能引起有关部门的注意。
