Xinhua News Agency, November 11th - According to TASS, Paris, November 10th: The working people of France continue to protest against the attacks by fascist bandits on the offices of progressive organizations.

    Despite a ban issued by the Prefect of the Rhône department, thousands of working people in Lyon marched through the streets on the 9th, shouting slogans like "Do not allow fascism to act recklessly." Afterwards, a mass rally was held in a central square.

    Large-scale anti-fascist demonstrations were also held in cities such as Nice, Nancy, and Firminy. Yesterday, workers in many enterprises stopped work and held mass rallies, resolutely condemning the destructive activities of fascist organizations and reaffirming their anti-fascist determination.

    The French Communist Party issued a statement emphasizing that counter-revolutionary forces are attempting to create chaos in France. The statement said that now, as in the past, the active movements of fascist forces are always related to the intensification of the international situation, which this time is caused by the adventurous behavior of France and Britain in Egypt. It is necessary to repel the fascist offensive in order to save the Republic and prevent war. The Progressive Republican Union also issued a statement pointing out that the French reactionaries, out of hatred for the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary, have launched a movement against progressive organizations in France.

    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社巴黎10日讯：法国劳动人民继续抗议法西斯匪徒对进步组织办公处的袭击。
    尽管罗尼省省长下令禁止，但是9日里昂的成千的劳动人民喊着“不许法西斯主义胡作非为”的口号在街上游行。然后，在一个中央广场上举行了群众大会。
    在尼萨、南锡、非尔松等城市也举行了声势浩大的反法西斯游行。许多企业的劳动者昨天停止了工作，举行群众大会，坚决谴责法西斯组织的破坏活动，重申反法西斯主义的决心。
    法国共产党发表声明强调指出，反革命势力企图在法国引起混乱。声明说，现在和过去一样，法西斯势力的积极活动总是与国际局势的尖锐化有关，这次国际局势的尖锐化是由于法国和英国在埃及的冒险行为而引起的。必须击退法西斯主义的进攻，以便挽救共和国和防止战争。进步共和联盟也发表声明指出，法国反动派由于痛恨匈牙利的反革命叛乱被镇压下去，所以发起了反对法国进步组织的运动。（附图片）
