	The "Package, Delay, Push, Rely" Methods Are Unacceptable
	--Hoping the First Ministry of Machine Building Will Improve Ordering Work
	This year, the First Ministry of Machine Building has adopted the methods of "package, delay, push, rely" for mechanical products ordered by some domestic units. They package the tasks, but delay signing contracts, push internally, and finally simply cancel the contracts. This practice has caused great losses to the user units.
	This year, when we submitted an order for ball bearings to the Soviet Union, the First Ministry of Machine Building kept several tens of thousands of them for its affiliated factories to produce, but not a single one had been delivered by the end of August. They promised to supply only 0.58% of what should have been supplied in the fourth quarter.
	Some materials, the First Ministry of Machine Building is fully capable of supplying, as long as their internal units do not bicker with each other. For example, we need ten items of steel balls, totaling tens of thousands, and applied for orders from the First Ministry of Machine Building at the National Ordering Conference in February. However, to this day, the First Ministry of Machine Building has not agreed to accept the order. When we negotiated with the Sales Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, they said: "You go to the Automotive Industry Administration Bureau of our Ministry and ask the Automotive Bureau to assign the task, then we will accept the order." When we arrived at the Automotive Bureau, the Automotive Bureau said: "Ordering is the business of the Sales Bureau. We will do whatever the Sales Bureau asks us to do." For this matter, we ran to the Sales Bureau eight times and to the Automotive Bureau six times, met with section chiefs and division chiefs, and it took half a year to finally get through the Automotive Bureau. Because the production of these steel balls is not difficult, the Automotive Bureau directly assigned the task to the manufacturing plant. However, the Sales Bureau said: "Although the Automotive Bureau has already assigned the task, we don’t know whether the manufacturing plant has included this task in its plan. We must have the manufacturing plant report the production plan before we accept the order." The problem has been delayed like this and has not been resolved until now.
	It is understandable that some products cannot meet the needs because the production capacity of the manufacturing plant is limited. However, the manufacturing plant can still refuse to accept the ordering task that has been approved by the First Ministry of Machine Building. If you go to the Sales Bureau again and ask them to think of a solution, they will at most write you a letter of introduction, asking the manufacturing plant to "try their best" to find a solution, and we have to run back and forth between the Sales Bureau and the manufacturing plant.
	What is more serious is that they often cancel contracts arbitrarily without consulting the ordering party.
	Work delays also increase the difficulty of ordering and supply work. Take this year’s National Ordering Conference of the First Ministry of Machine Building as an example. It took nearly three months from reporting the ordering plan to signing the specific contract. The things needed in the second quarter were not signed until the end of April. Adding two to three months of production cycle, it is simply impossible to supply them in the second quarter. This artificially increases the tension of supply.
	With the rapid development of the national industry, the new equipment and new materials required by various industrial departments are also increasing day by day, which will inevitably make the relationship between the departments more complicated and frequent. If the chaotic and irresponsible phenomena of the First Ministry of Machine Building in external cooperation are not changed quickly, it will inevitably hinder the national industrial construction. We sincerely hope that the First Ministry of Machine Building will quickly improve its work in this regard. Luo Huaiyi

### “包、拖、推、赖”的办法要不得——希望第一机械工业部改进订货工作

    “包、拖、推、赖”的办法要不得
    ——希望第一机械工业部改进订货工作
    今年，第一机械工业部对于国内某些单位订购的机械产品，采取了“包”、“拖”、“推”、“赖”的办法。他们把任务包下来，但又拖着不签订合同，内部互相推，最后干脆取消合同。这种做法，给使用单位造成很大损失。
    今年我们向苏联提出滚珠轴承订货的时候，第一机械工业部把其中的若干万个留下来给所属工厂生产，可是直到今年8月底止，一个也没有交货。他们答应第四季度供应的只相当于应该供应的0.58％。
    有些器材，第一机械工业部是完全有条件供应的，只要他们内部各单位不互相扯皮。例如我们需要十项钢珠共若干万个，在2月份全国订货会议上就向第一机械工业部申请订货，可是一直到现在，第一机械工业部还没有答应是否接受订货。我们到第一机械工业部销售局交涉时，他们说：“你们去和我部汽车工业管理局交涉，要汽车局下任务，我们就接受订货。”我们到了汽车局，汽车局又说：“订货是销售局的事，销售局要我们作什么，我们就照办。”为这事，我们跑了八趟销售局，跑了六趟汽车局，见了科长又见处长，历时半年，总算把汽车局这一关打通了。由于生产这些钢珠并不困难，汽车局就把任务直接下达到承制厂。可是销售局又说：“虽然汽车局已经下了任务，但不知承制厂是否已经把这个任务列入了计划，必须要承制厂把生产计划报来以后，我们才接受订货。”问题就这样被拖下来，直到现在还没解决。
    因为承制厂的生产能力有限，有些产品不能满足需要，这是可以理解的。但是，已经第一机械工业部批准的订货任务，承制厂仍可以不接受订货。如果你再去找销售局，要他们给想想办法，他们最多给你写一封介绍信，请承制厂“尽量”设法解决，而我们就得在销售局和承制厂之间跑来跑去。
    更严重的是他们经常不征求订货方的同意，任意取消合同。
    工作拖拉也给订货和供应工作增加困难。就拿今年第一机械工业部的全国订货会议来说，从上报订货计划到签订具体合同，前后将近三个月。第二季度要的东西，到4月底才签订合同，加上两个月到三个月的生产周期，第二季度根本就不可能供应了。这就人为地加重了供应的紧张。
    随着国家工业的迅速发展，各工业部门所需要的新装备、新器材也日益增加，这就必然使各部门之间的关系更加错综频繁。如果第一机械工业部对外协作上的混乱和不负责任现象不迅速改变，必然会妨碍国家工业建设。我们十分希望第一机械工业部迅速改进这方面的工作。　罗怀毅
