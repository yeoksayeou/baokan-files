Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, November 24th: Benxi City's total industrial output value has reached the level specified in the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Among the main products, raw coal, steel, iron ore, steel ingots, and others have already completed the production levels of the Five-Year Plan. The city's industrial production costs have also been reduced by nearly 3% compared with the original Five-Year Plan target.

The main reason why Benxi City's state-owned and locally state-owned enterprises reached the total output value level of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule is that existing enterprises have greatly unleashed their production potential this year. This year, the total output value of the city's existing state-owned factories and mines increased by approximately 40% compared to last year, a figure that greatly exceeds the annual growth rate of total output value in the past three years. Benxi Steel Plant, under Benxi Iron and Steel Company, has paid attention to solving the problem of steelmaking capacity being lower than steel rolling and forging capacity in the past two years. It added three electric furnaces in existing factory buildings and widely adopted new technologies to increase steel production. This year's steel output will increase by 90% compared to last year. The refractory material factory under Benxi Iron and Steel Company not only reversed the situation of low refractory brick quality this year but also increased production by about 50%. This year, Cai Tun Shaft of Benxi Mining Bureau has increased raw coal production by more than 70% compared to last year because a part of the new mining area began to be mined. In addition, the Niuxintai Coal Mine, with an annual output of more than 200,000 tons, also resumed production this year.

This year, in the case of relatively rapid growth in production volume, factories and mines in Benxi City also encountered difficulties that have not been seen in previous years. For example, the use of a large number of lean iron ore for ironmaking once caused production instability, the supply of iron ore and scrap steel was insufficient, and transportation could not keep up, etc.

    本溪市工业总产值达到五年计划规定的水平
    提前完成原煤、钢材、铁矿石和钢锭等产品的产量指标
    新华社本溪24日电　本溪市工业总产值提前达到了五年计划规定的水平。在主要产品中，原煤、钢材、铁矿石、钢锭等已经完成五年计划的产量水平，全市工业生产成本也比五年计划原指标降低了近3％。
    本溪市国营、地方国营企业提前达到五年计划总产值水平的主要原因，是今年现有企业大大发挥了生产潜力。今年，全市现有国营厂矿的总产值比去年提高了约40％，这个数字大大超过了过去三年每年总产值的增长速度。本溪钢铁公司所属本溪钢厂，近两年来由于注意解决炼钢能力小于轧钢和锻钢能力的问题，在现有厂房内增添三座电炉，并且广泛采用增加钢产量的新技术，今年的钢材产量将比去年增加90％。本溪钢铁公司所属的耐火材料厂，今年不但扭转了耐火砖质量低的局面，产量也相应提高50％左右。本溪矿务局彩屯竖井今年由于有一部分新采煤区开始开采，原煤产量比去年提高了70％以上。此外，年产二十多万吨的牛心台煤矿也在今年恢复生产。
    本溪市各厂矿今年在生产量增长较快的情况下，也遇到了历年来所没有的困难。如采用大量贫铁矿炼铁而一度引起生产不稳定，铁矿石和废钢供应不足，交通运输方面跟不上等等。
