    "Menstrual Card"
    Agricultural cooperatives in YuHang County, Zhejiang Province, have widely promoted the "menstrual card" and "pregnancy registration" methods to take care of the special difficulties of female cooperative members.
    This method was first implemented in March of this year by the Second Production Team of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Shengli Township, YuHang County. Each young and middle-aged female cooperative member in this production team has a hard paper card called the "Menstrual Card," with her name written on it. Whenever their period comes, they hand their menstrual card to the female team leader; when female members become pregnant, they also register with the female team leader. In this way, when the production team allocates labor, they know which female members are menstruating and which are pregnant, and can pay attention to their physical strength, appropriately assigning them light labor, and not letting them do heavy work or work in paddy fields. When a female member's menstruation stops, she retrieves the menstrual card from the team leader.
    In the past, when the team allocated work, they didn't know which female members were menstruating or newly pregnant, so they didn't pay attention to their needs. When women who were menstruating or newly pregnant were assigned heavy work or work in paddy fields, they were often embarrassed to voice their concerns, resulting in them not being able to do the work well and damaging their health. Since the new method was adopted nearly eight months ago, no female members have experienced miscarriages or menstrual problems. The team's labor force has increased, and everyone's work points have also increased.

### “月经牌”

    “月经牌”
    浙江省余杭县的农业社里普遍推广了“月经牌”和“孕期登记”的办法，照顾女社员的特殊困难。
    这个办法是余杭县胜利乡的前进农业社第二生产队在今年3月间最先开始实行的。这个生产队的青壮年女社员每人各有一张硬纸片叫做“月经牌”，上面写着自己的名字。每当月经来的时候，她们就把自己的月经牌交给女小组长；女社员怀孕了，也向女小组长登记一下。这样，生产队在进行劳力分工的时候，就知道那个女社员来月经，那个怀了孕，就能注意照顾她们体力，适当分配给她们轻微劳动，不让她们干重活和下水田。女社员月经停了，就把月经牌从小组长那里取回来。
    过去这个队在分工的时候，不知道那个女社员来月经，那个刚怀孕，就没有注意照顾。来月经或刚怀孕的妇女分配到干重活和下水田的时候，又因为怕难为情，不愿意提意见，结果，往往活干不好，身体又搞坏了。新办法被采用将近八个月以来，女社员再也没有发生过流产或患月经病的情况。队里劳动力增加，大家劳动工分也增加了。
