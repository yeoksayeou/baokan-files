Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 23rd - Farmer Pu Bogao, who raised forty-one pigs in one year, is estimated to earn more than 1,100 yuan from this endeavor.

    Pu Bogao is the deputy director of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Panlong Township, Nanchong County, Sichuan Province. His family has twenty members, and they have raised a total of forty-one pigs from last winter to the present. Besides those already sold, they still have twenty-two pigs of various sizes. Among them, two Rongchang breed white pigs have already grown to over 400 catties each.

    Not long ago, Pu Bogao introduced his family's experience in raising a large number of pigs at an enlarged meeting of district and township cadres convened by the Nanchong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. One of his experiences is solving the feed problem from various aspects. His family makes full use of the private plots and the feed plots allocated by the cooperative (the cooperative stipulates that each member is allocated one fen of feed land for each pig raised), intercropping, interplanting, and rotating a large number of high-yielding feed crops such as sugar beets, chard, and radishes according to the soil quality and season. His family pays close attention to storing all possible feed. For example, sweet potato vines, sweet potato peels, pea leaves, and broad bean leaves are stored by silage or dry storage methods. Over the past year, his family has harvested and stored about 200,000 catties of feed. His entire family also implements a reasonable division of labor, with two women (and sometimes children) regularly going to the fields to collect wild pig feed. In addition, his family also attaches great importance to carefully selecting pig breeds, feeding pigs regularly and quantitatively, and keeping the pigsty clean, etc.

    蒲伯高家养猪四十一只
    新华社成都23日电　一年内养了四十一只猪的农民蒲伯高，据计算从这方面获得的收入将达到一千一百多元。
    蒲伯高是四川省南充县蟠龙乡先锋农业社的副主任。他全家有二十口人，从去年冬天到现在共养猪四十一只。除已经卖掉的外，现在还养着大、中、小猪二十二只。其中两只荣昌种白猪，都已经长到四百多斤重。
    不久以前，蒲伯高在中共南充县委员会召开的区、乡干部扩大会议上，介绍了他家大量养猪的经验。一条经验是从多方面解决了饲料问题。他家充分利用自留地和社里拨给的饲料地（社里规定社员每养一只猪便拨给一分饲料地），根据土质和季节，套种、间种和轮种了大量甜菜、牛皮菜、萝卜等高产的饲料作物。他家很注意储藏一切可能得到的饲料。如红薯藤、红薯皮、豌豆叶、蚕豆叶等，都采用青贮或干贮的办法储藏起来。一年来，他家收获和储藏的饲料有二十万斤左右。他全家还实行合理分工，经常保持有两个妇女（有时还有小孩）到野外去采集野生猪饲料。此外，他家也很重视精选猪种，喂猪定食定量，保持猪圈清洁等。
