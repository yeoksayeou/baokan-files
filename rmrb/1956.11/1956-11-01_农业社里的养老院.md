    Nursing Home in the Agricultural Cooperative
    Chen Chuang
    The setting sun, like a red orange, hid itself in the lush green trees. The ox carts returning late rumbled across the boundless fields. In the village, wisps of smoke rose from the earthen-yellow thatched roofs, curling towards the clear blue sky.

    Director Wang of the Red Flower Agricultural Cooperative, who had lived here for more than forty years, always felt a sense of fascination with these beautiful and tranquil scenes. He silently gazed for a while, then grabbed my arm and said, "Didn't you want to understand the cooperative's situation? Come on, let's first go check out the nursing home on the east side of the village." I knew that the nursing home was established after the advanced cooperative was formed; this was something unheard of in this place for thousands of years.

    At this time, at the entrance of the nursing home, in twos and threes, some were visiting the elderly, and others were bringing small snacks. As we stepped into the nursing home, we suddenly saw four or five children wearing red scarves swarming in from the gate. As soon as they entered, they raised a hand and shouted in unison to the old people with canes, "Hello, Grandpa!" "Hello, Grandma!" As soon as the words fell, they rushed up to help the elderly sweep the kang and clean the yard.

    Under the jujube tree in the courtyard, there was an old woman who was blind in both eyes. She was originally sitting and weaving straw braid, but as soon as she heard the children's voices, she hurriedly dropped the straw braid in her hand and walked over, groping as if searching for something, shaking her feet, and greeting the children, "Rest a while and have a bowl of tea, ah, look how busy you are, just like little wild horses." The children jumped for joy and replied in unison, "Not tired, not tired, we are not tired!" The old woman sighed helplessly, and then asked this and that, trying to talk to the children.

    It turned out that this old woman was not a local, nor did she have a proper name; everyone just called her Granny Ding. In 1932, her husband died. At that time, there was war and chaos, and she had no land and no children, so she had no food or clothing. Later, due to overwork, she also went blind. Thus, she was all alone. Even when the wind and snow filled the sky, and foot-long icicles hung from the eaves, she had to hold a broken bowl, hunch her back, and tremble as she leaned against people's doors begging for food.

    The visitors left one after another. The children also cleaned up the yard and said goodbye to Granny Ding.

    "Rest a while before you go, rest a while." Granny Ding kept waving to the children and insisted on seeing them off. With great difficulty, the children persuaded her to go back. Her few silver hairs fluttered in the wind, and she smiled sweetly.

    Director Wang saw that Granny Ding was staggering and unsteady, and hurriedly went up to help her, asking with a grin, "Is it better in the nursing home than when you were begging?" Granny Ding pursed her mouth, which had lost its teeth, and nodded repeatedly, "Good, good, even better than in the elementary cooperative!" Once the topic was opened, Granny Ding kept muttering non-stop. She said that Old Man Xingwang was so sick that he couldn't even moan, but this time, Dr. Zhang had treated him so well that he could sit up and eat a steamed bun. Later, as if she wanted to tell us some secret news, she deliberately lowered her voice: "Old Man Xingwang is over eighty years old. We used to go to his door to beg for food. It's just that his son was unworthy, eating, drinking, whoring, gambling, and even taking up opium. In just a few years, Old Man Xingwang's one qing of land and five large tile-roofed houses were all ruined by his son. Afterwards, his son died, and then there was a famine, so he had no choice but to beg for food. Truly, a thousand-mile shed, there's no banquet that doesn't end!"

    I don't know when, Dr. Zhang from the agricultural cooperative clinic had already arrived with his medicine kit. When we helped Granny Ding into the house, he was giving Old Man Xingwang an injection. When Old Man Xingwang saw that Director Wang had arrived, he struggled to sit up after receiving the injection. He grabbed Director Wang's hand and said excitedly, "Director, sit down, sit down!" At this time, Granny Ding was again muttering and asking Dr. Zhang about treating her eyes. Dr. Zhang opened her eyelids to take a look and said that it had been many years, and to treat it, she would probably have to go to a large hospital for surgery. When Granny Ding heard about surgery, as if the doctor was going to dig out her eyes, she waved her hands repeatedly and said, "Dr. Zhang, we won't go, even though you see that I'm blind, I still have two bright eyes in my heart!" This made everyone in the room laugh.

    The sky slowly darkened, and we said goodbye to the old people and came out. Just as we walked out of the gate, we ran into two young men carrying two buckets of water, rushing to deliver them to the nursing home. Director Wang smiled and waved his arms to them: "Young men, hurry up, you're late again this time!"

    农业社里的养老院
    陈窗
    夕阳像一只红色的橘子，躲进了碧绿茵茵的树林。晚归的牛车，在一望无边的田野上辘辘地震响着。村子里，一缕缕炊烟，正从土黄色的茅屋顶上，袅袅地升向晴碧的天空。
    红花农业社的王社长，在这儿住了四十多年，对这些优美而恬静的景色，总怀着迷恋的心情。他默默地呆望了一会，一把拉住我说：“你不是要了解社里的情况吗？走，咱们先上村东头养老院去瞧瞧。”我知道，养老院是在高级社成立后才建立的，在这儿，是千古未闻的新事哩。
    这时候，在养老院的门口，三三两两，有去探望老人们的，也有去送些零碎吃食的。我们跨进养老院的时候，忽然看见四、五个系红领巾的孩子，从大门口拥进来。他们一进门，举起一只手，向那些拄着拐棍的老人们齐声喊，“爷爷好！”“奶奶好！”话音刚落，就一哄而上，帮助老人们扫炕和打扫院落。
    在院子里的枣树下，有一位双目失明的老婆婆，原本是坐着织草帽辫的，一听见孩子们的声音，赶忙把手里的草帽辫丢下，像摸索什么似的，抖动着两只脚走过来，向孩子们招呼：“快歇歇喝碗茶吧，唉，看你们忙的，真像小野马似的。”孩子们欢蹦欢跳，齐声回答：“不累，不累，我们不累！”老婆婆无可奈何地叹了一口气，就问这问那的，找孩子们说话。
    原来，这位老婆婆并不是本村人，也没个正经名字，大家只喊她丁老婆婆。1932年她的丈夫死了，那时兵荒马乱的，她家里既无田地又无儿女，吃穿都无着落。往后又因劳累过度，眼睛也瞎了。这样，她孤零零一个人，那怕是风雪满天，屋檐上挂了一尺来长的冰柱，也只好托着一只破碗，躬着背，抖抖索索地依在人家门上求乞。
    来探望的人陆续地走了。孩子们也把院落收拾好了，就向丁老婆婆告别。
    “歇歇再走啊，歇歇啊。”丁老婆婆直向孩子们招手，并硬要去送。好容易，孩子们才把她劝了回去。她的几根银色的头发在风中飘动着，她甜滋滋地笑着。
    王社长见丁老婆婆颤颤巍巍地走不稳当，赶忙上去扶她，笑嘻嘻地问：“在养老院里，比你要饭那阵子好吧？”丁老婆婆努了努已经脱落牙齿的嘴，连连点头说：“好，好，比初级社那阵子还要好！”话一提起头，丁老婆婆就嘀咕个不休。她说兴旺老爹病得连哼都不会哼了，这回也叫张大夫治得能坐起来吃一个馒头了。说到后来，她好像要告诉我们什么秘密消息似的，故意放低了声音：“兴旺老爹八十多啦。咱从前上他门上去要过饭呢。就是啊，他儿子不争气，吃穿嫖赌，还抽上了大烟，不上几年，兴旺老爹的一顷来地、五间大瓦房，全败在他儿子手里了。往后，他儿子一死，又遇上了灾荒，他也就只好去要饭了。真是，千里搭凉篷，那有不散的筵席！”
    不知是什么时候，农业社诊疗所的张大夫已经提着药箱来了。我们扶丁老婆婆进屋的时候，他正在替兴旺老爹打针。兴旺老爹见是王社长来了，刚打好针，就吃力地坐起来，他一把握住王社长的手，激动地说：“社长，坐，坐啊！”这时候，丁老婆婆又嘀嘀咕咕地在问张大夫关于治眼睛的事儿。张大夫翻开她的眼皮瞧了瞧，说是年数多了，要治恐怕也得上大医院去开刀。丁老婆婆一听说开刀，就像大夫要挖她眼睛似的，连连摆手说：“张大夫，咱不去啦，你别瞧咱眼瞎，咱心里还生着两只明明亮亮的眼睛呢！”这一说，把满屋子的人都说得笑了起来。
    天色慢慢地黑了，我们辞别了老人们出来。刚走出大门，正碰上两个小伙子挑着两担水飞也似地给养老院送来。王社长含着笑意，向他们挥动着手臂：“小伙子，快点，这回你们又落后啦！”
