Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 3rd: Rome dispatch: The Executive Committee of the Italian Communist Party passed a resolution on November 3rd stating that if Soviet troops were to withdraw from Hungary under the present circumstances, it would "cause anarchy and white terror" in Hungary.

If this situation were to occur, Hungary would become "a center for provoking peace in the entire European region."

The resolution declared that the Soviet Union "has accomplished and is accomplishing irreplaceable tasks in the struggle of all peoples against imperialism, in defense of peace, and in the struggle for liberation from class enslavement."

"Without the aid of the Soviet Union, without the strength and the existence of the Soviet Union, the progress of all countries moving towards socialism would be much slower, more difficult, and more painful."

    意大利共产党执委会通过决议说
    苏联军队目前不能撤出匈牙利
    新华社布拉格3日电　罗马消息：意大利共产党执行委员会在11月3日通过的一项决议中说，苏联军队在目前的情况下从匈牙利撤走的话，就将在匈牙利“引起无政府状态和白色恐怖”。
    如果这种情况发生了，匈牙利就将成为“对整个欧洲地区的和平进行挑衅的中心”。
    决议宣布，苏联“在各国人民反对帝国主义、保卫和平和争取从阶级奴役下解放出来的斗争中，已经完成并且正在完成不可代替的任务”。
    “如果没有苏联的援助，如果没有苏联的力量和苏联的存在，所有走向社会主义的国家的进展就会慢得多，艰难得多和痛苦得多。”
