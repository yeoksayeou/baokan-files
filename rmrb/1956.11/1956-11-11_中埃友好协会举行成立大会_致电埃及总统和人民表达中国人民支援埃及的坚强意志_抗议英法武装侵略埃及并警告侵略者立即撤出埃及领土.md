Xinhua News Agency, 10th – The China-Egypt Friendship Association held its inaugural meeting this morning at the Capital Theater in Beijing. Bao Erhan, president of the association, said at the meeting: "The main task of this association is to do its utmost to assist the Chinese People's Committee to Support Egypt Against Aggression to jointly strive to support Egypt in resisting British, French, and Israeli aggression. We firmly declare that until the invading armies of Britain, France, and Israel have withdrawn from Egyptian soil, the Chinese people will continue to stand with the people of the world and take all effective measures to support the Egyptian people until the aggressors are driven out of Egyptian territory."

Bao Erhan said that there is a traditional friendship between China and Egypt. In particular, both of our countries gained freedom and independence from the struggle against colonialist aggression. We are friends in adversity.

Bao Erhan said that the aggression against Egypt by British and French colonialists and Israeli troops has aroused the anger of all the Chinese people. Now, a nationwide movement to support Egypt has penetrated every corner and every stratum of China. The Chinese people will use practical actions to express our firm will to defend world peace and support the Egyptian people in resisting aggression.

Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Peng Dehuai and He Long, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Saifudin, Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, Vice Minister of Culture Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Mayor of Beijing Le Songsheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Yang Hansheng, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Chen Shutong, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs Zhang Xiruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Lai Ruoyu, Vice President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation Li Dequan, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation Liao Chengzhi, and Vice Director of the China Islamic Cultural Association Ma Songting attended today's inaugural meeting.

Egyptian Ambassador to China Hassan Ragab, Commercial Representative Far, Cultural Attaché Badran, and others were also invited to participate in the inaugural meeting.

Vice President of the China-Egypt Friendship Association Da Pangsheng first delivered the opening speech at the meeting. He pointed out that the establishment of the association marks the development of friendly relations between China and Egypt. The purpose of the association is to further strengthen the friendly relations between China and Egypt and support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. Then President Bao Erhan spoke.

Egyptian Ambassador to China Ragab addressed the meeting. On behalf of the Egyptian people, he warmly welcomed the establishment of the China-Egypt Friendship Association and wished the association good results. He hoped that the purpose of the association would be to bring the views of China and Egypt closer in political, economic, cultural, and social aspects.

After reviewing the traditional friendship between China and Egypt, Ambassador Ragab said that the colonialist countries are unwilling to see the restoration and development of friendship between China and Egypt, and are unwilling to see Egypt become an independent and sovereign country, expressing friendship with friendly countries and resisting aggressive countries. They cannot stand this new atmosphere and cannot bear to hear this new song, so they decided to use force to extinguish this country. The Ambassador emphasized that he is full of confidence that with the mutual assistance and friendship of the people of Asia and Africa, we will surely make the enemies of peace reap what they have sown. Because our principle, as declared at the Bandung Conference, is to establish world peace on a solid foundation, and such peace can guarantee the tranquility of all mankind. The Ambassador's speech won extremely warm applause.

The inaugural meeting unanimously adopted a telegram to Egyptian President Nasser and the Egyptian people, stating that the 600 million Chinese people will always be with the Egyptian people, wishing the friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian people to further grow in the common struggle, and wishing the Egyptian people to win the final victory in the struggle against the British and French aggressors.

Another telegram passed by the meeting protested the armed aggression against Egypt by Britain and France, and warned the British and French governments to immediately stop slaughtering the Egyptian people and immediately withdraw all invading troops from Egypt.

    中埃友好协会举行成立大会
    致电埃及总统和人民表达中国人民支援埃及的坚强意志  抗议英法武装侵略埃及并警告侵略者立即撤出埃及领土
    新华社10日讯　中国埃及友好协会今天上午在北京首都剧场举行成立大会。协会会长包尔汉在成立大会上说：“本会的主要任务是尽最大努力来协助中国人民支援埃及反抗侵略委员会来共同为支援埃及反抗英法以侵略而努力。我们坚决表示：在英法以三个国家的侵略军队还没有退出埃及国土以前，中国人民将继续和全世界人民在一起，采取一切有效措施支援埃及人民，直到把侵略者从埃及领土上赶出去。”
    包尔汉说，中国和埃及之间有着传统的友谊。特别是我们两个国家，都是从反殖民主义侵略的斗争中获得自由和独立的。我们是患难与共的朋友。
    包尔汉说，英法殖民主义者和以色列的军队侵略埃及的行为，激起了全中国人民的愤怒。现在，全国规模支援埃及的运动已深入到中国的各个角落、各个阶层中去，中国人民要用实际行动来表达我们保卫世界和平、支援埃及人民反抗侵略的坚强意志。
    国务院总理周恩来，副总理彭德怀、贺龙，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长赛福鼎，对外贸易部部长叶季壮，外交部副部长张闻天，文化部副部长张致祥，北京市副市长乐松生，中国人民对外文化协会副会长阳翰笙，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席陈叔通，中国人民外交学会会长张奚若，中华全国总工会主席赖若愚，中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席李德全，中华全国民主青年联合会主席廖承志，中国回民文化协进会副主任马松亭等出席了今天的成立大会。
    埃及驻华大使哈桑·拉加卜、商务代表法尔、文化专员巴德朗等也应邀参加了成立大会。
    中国埃及友好协会副会长达浦生今天首先在会上致开幕词。他指出协会的成立标志着中国埃及友好关系的发展。协会的宗旨是进一步加强中埃两国的友好关系，支援埃及人民的正义斗争。接着包尔汉会长讲了话。
    埃及驻中国大使拉加卜在大会上致词。他代表埃及全国人民热烈欢迎中国埃及友好协会的成立，预祝这个协会获得良好的成绩。他希望这个协会的宗旨是使中埃两国在政治、经济、文化和社会等方面的观点互相接近。
    拉加卜大使在回溯了中埃两国传统的友谊以后说，殖民主义各国不愿意看见中埃两国友谊的恢复和发展，不愿意看见埃及成为一个独立自主的国家，跟友好的国家表示友好，对侵略的国家进行抵抗，它们看不惯这种新气象，听不惯这种新的歌曲，所以它们决定用武力来扑灭这个国家。大使强调说，他满怀信心地希望凭着亚非各国人民的互助合作和友谊，我们一定能使和平的敌人自食其果。因为我们的原则正如万隆会议所宣布的那样是把世界和平建立在坚定的基础之上，这样的和平才能保证全人类的安宁。大使的讲话博得了极其热烈的掌声。
    成立大会一致通过了致埃及共和国总统纳赛尔和埃及人民的电文，表示六万万中国人民将永远同埃及人民在一起，祝中埃两国人民的友谊在共同的战斗中进一步成长，祝埃及人民反抗英法侵略者的斗争获得最后的胜利。
    大会通过的另一封电文抗议英法武装侵略埃及，警告英法政府立即停止屠杀埃及人民，立即从埃及撤退全部侵略军队。
