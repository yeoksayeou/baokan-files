To overcome blindness in the supply of means of production, Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative conducts in-depth investigations in rural areas and formulates next year's supply tasks based on needs

(Our newspaper dispatch) The Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, learning from the lessons of the huge losses caused by the blind organization and distribution of means of production in the spring and summer of this year, first conducted in-depth investigation and research work before convening a meeting on the supply of means of production in mid-October.

The Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative achieved certain successes in organizing and supplying means of production this spring. Up to the third quarter of this year, the total supply increased by more than 50% compared with the same period last year. However, in the spring and summer of this year, the provincial cooperative, without conducting thorough investigation and research, blindly allocated new-style farm tools such as double-wheeled double-shared plows and rice threshers downward, and did not provide specific guidance and inspection after the allocation, resulting in serious backlogs in most parts of the province. The county-level supply and marketing cooperatives also suffered from this subjective style of thinking that did not involve investigation and research. In May and June of this year, the stock of pesticides in more than 50 county cooperatives was sufficient for supply, but they still requested large quantities of pesticides from the provincial cooperative, most of which were later stockpiled. The Nan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, without considering the actual needs of farmers, prepared more than 12,000 rice-harvesting sheets for use during the early rice harvest, but only sold more than 3,500 sheets. In many areas, small farm tools such as bamboo baskets, sickles, and sun-drying mats needed for the autumn harvest were out of stock due to insufficient prior preparation by the supply and marketing cooperatives.

The Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, learning from the above lessons, sent out four working groups in August and September to investigate the needs for means of production in agricultural cooperatives for next year. The investigation revealed that the supply of fertilizer will be an important task next year. The Xinghua Advanced Cooperative in Lingling County will need 40% more commercial fertilizer next year than this year. In some areas with favorable natural conditions and well-done technical guidance, farmers are very fond of new-style farm tools. The investigation also revealed that regulating draft cattle is an important task. The province's draft cattle are basically sufficient, but their distribution is uneven. Currently, in cattle-producing areas, one draft animal averages only a dozen to twenty mu of cultivated land, while in cattle-deficient areas, one animal will bear more than sixty mu, up to one hundred mu of cultivated land.

Based on these investigation materials, the meeting on the supply of means of production believed that the main task in the supply of means of production in Hunan Province next year is to vigorously tap local fertilizer sources. The amount of fertilizer needed by agricultural cooperatives next year is very large, while the amount of commercial fertilizer is still small. Only by vigorously tapping local fertilizer sources can the requirements of agricultural cooperatives be met. The meeting summarized and exchanged experiences in tapping local fertilizer sources. The meeting also pointed out that in areas with favorable natural conditions, new-style farm tools should be actively and steadily promoted, and technical guidance should be strengthened. In the regulation of draft cattle, the main approach is to adjust regional price differences and organize established cattle markets to transfer draft cattle from cattle-producing areas to cattle-deficient areas. Many county supply and marketing cooperatives have also conducted typical investigation work, preparing to further formulate specific supply plans and organize sources of goods based on local conditions to welcome the spring plowing next year.

    克服生产资料供应工作中的盲目性
    湖南省供销社深入农村进行调查，根据需要规定明年供应任务
    本报讯　湖南省供销合作社，接受今年春夏两季盲目组织和分配生产资料造成巨大损失的教训，在10月中旬召开生产资料供应工作会议之前，先进行了深入的调查研究工作。
    湖南省供销社今年春天在组织和供应生产资料工作上，是取得一定成绩的。至今年第三季度止，供应总额比去年同期增加50％强。但是，在今年春夏两季，省社不经切实调查研究，盲目地往下调拨双轮双铧犁和打稻机等新式农具，调拨后又不加具体指导和检查，结果在全省多数地区造成严重的积压情况。县一级的供销社也存在这种不调查研究的主观主义思想作风。今年5、6月间，五十多个县社库存的农药已够供应，还向省社要了大批农药，后来大部分也积压下来了。南县供销社没有根据农民的实际需要，在收割早稻前准备了收稻时用的围页一万二千多床，最后只销出去三千五百多床。许多地区秋收需要的箩筐、镰刀、晒簟等小农具，却因供销社事先准备不足，而发生脱销的现象。
    湖南省供销合作社接受以上教训，在8、9月时派出去四个工作组，到各地农业社调查明年生产资料的需要情况。调查中发现明年的肥料供应是一项重要的任务，零陵县星华高级社明年比今年要增加40％的商品肥料。部分自然条件具备而技术指导工作又做得较好的地区，农民很喜欢新式农具。在调查中也发现，调剂耕牛是件重要的任务。全省耕牛基本上是够用的，但是分布得不均匀。现在产牛区一头耕牛平均只负担十几亩到二十亩耕地，缺牛区一头牛则将负担六十亩以上最高到一百亩的耕地。
    根据这些调查材料，生产资料供应会议认为，湖南省明年生产资料供应工作中的主要任务，是大力发掘地方肥源。明年农业社肥料的需要数量很大，而商品肥料仍为数不多，只有大力发掘地方肥源才能满足农业社的要求。会上总结和交流了发掘地方肥源的经验。会议也指出：在自然条件具备的地区，应积极稳步地推广新式农具，加强技术指导工作。在耕牛的调剂工作上，主要从调整地区差价和组织有习惯的耕牛市场入手，从产牛地区调剂耕牛到缺牛地区去。许多县供销社也都作了典型调查工作，准备进一步因地制宜地制定具体的供应计划和组织货源，迎接明年春耕。　（高长任）
