Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th: Hong Kong dispatch: Lam Mun-yuk, a senior high school student at Hong Kong's Heung To Middle School, handed over two records of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's speeches to the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" on the 6th, entrusting "Ta Kung Pao" to transfer them to relevant organizations to be presented to the nation.

The two records are parts of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's speeches "Encouraging the People" and "Admonishing Comrades," recorded by the "Shanghai China Evening News Gramophone Department."

These two records were purchased by Lam Mun-yuk's late father in Indonesia more than twenty years ago and have been carefully preserved until now. This time, in response to the call to donate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's relics and manuscripts, she dedicated them.

    香港学生献出演讲录音片
    新华社广州8日电　香港消息：香港香岛中学高中三女学生林满玉6日把两张孙中山先生的演讲录音片交给香港“大公报”，托“大公报”转交有关机构献给国家。
    这两张录音片是孙中山先生演讲的“勉励国民”和“告诫同志”的一部分，是由“上海中国晚报留声部”录制的。
    这两张录音片是林满玉已故父亲二十多年前在印度尼西亚购买到的，一直被小心保藏到现在。这次她为了响应捐献孙中山先生遗物遗墨的号召，把它献了出来。
