Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 8th - The Indian Information Bureau announced today the recent exchange of letters between the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and the Prime Minister of India, Nehru, regarding the issue of British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt.

In his letter, Bulganin informed Nehru that, due to the threatening developments in the Egyptian situation, the Soviet government had decided to once again raise the issue in the United Nations organization regarding taking measures to stop British and French aggression. Furthermore, he suggested to the United States that all United Nations member states advocating for the maintenance of peace should, without delay, take joint military action, primarily military action by the Soviet Union and the United States, according to the decisions of the United Nations, to halt the aggression. His letter also stated that the Soviet government had issued a firm warning to Britain and France. He pointed out the importance of India's opinions in stopping the aggression.

In his reply, Nehru said, "We are deeply disturbed by Israel's invasion of Egypt, as well as the aggression against Egypt by the United Kingdom and France. We also deeply regret the disregard shown for the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. At a time when Egypt is facing a profound crisis, when its independence is threatened, and when there is an attempt to force it to accept political and other decisions under the pressure of superior force, we are in complete sympathy with Egypt in this respect. This aggression not only threatens Egypt, but also threatens other countries that may not have sufficient strength to resist aggression."

Nehru said that the resolutions recently passed by the United Nations General Assembly not only lead to a ceasefire but also create the possibility of compelling the invading forces to withdraw from Egyptian territory. If this goal can be achieved, then it will be easier to resolve the entire issue by methods that guarantee Egypt's independence and peacefully resolve outstanding issues.

Nehru also stated in his reply that although he fully agreed that any act of aggression should be stopped, he believed that military action should be avoided.

Nehru said: "We believe that even at this later stage, it is still possible to save peace from the battle that will suffocate it. Your great country can play a major role in resolving this issue. We in India will, of course, assist to the best of our ability with full determination and all our strength."

### 就英、法、以侵略埃及问题  布尔加宁和尼赫鲁交换了信件

    就英、法、以侵略埃及问题
    布尔加宁和尼赫鲁交换了信件
    新华社新德里8日电　印度新闻局今天公布了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和印度总理尼赫鲁最近关于英、法和以色列侵略埃及问题的来往信件。
    布尔加宁在他的信中告诉尼赫鲁，由于埃及局势的发展具有威胁性，苏联政府决定再次在联合国组织中提出关于采取措施制止英法侵略的问题，并且向美国建议，所有主张维持和平的联合国会员国毫不迟延地根据联合国的决定，采取联合军事行动，首先是苏联和美国的军事行动，来制止侵略。他的信还说，苏联政府已经向英法提出了坚决的警告。他指出印度的意见在制止侵略方面的重要性。
    尼赫鲁在复信中说，我们对以色列的入侵埃及，以及联合王国和法国的侵略埃及深感不安。我们对联合国大会决议受到轻视也深感遗憾。在埃及达到深刻危机的时候，当它的独立受到威胁和有人企图以优势兵力的压力来强迫它接受政治性决定和其他决定的时候，我们完全同情埃及这一方面。这种侵略不仅威胁着埃及，而且威胁着那些可能没有足够的力量来抵抗侵略的其他国家。
    尼赫鲁说，最近联合国大会通过的决议不仅会导致停火，而且会促使侵略军撤离埃及领土的可能性是完全存在的。如果能达到这一目的，那末，用保障埃及的独立和和平解决未决的问题的方法来解决整个问题，这就比较容易了。
    尼赫鲁还在复信中表示，他虽然完全同意应当制止任何侵略行动，但是认为应当避免采取军事行动。
    尼赫鲁说：“我们认为，即使是在这样较迟的阶段，还是可能从那将要窒息和平的战斗中拯救出和平的。伟大的贵国在解决这个问题方面可以起很大的作用。我们在印度，当然，将以充分的决心和尽我们的一切力量来进行我们能力所及的帮助。”
