    Do Not Undermine the Normal Hospital System
    Zheng Gao

    The article "Is Thirty Yuan Important? Or is a Person's Life Important?" published on page 4 of the People's Daily on August 13th, criticized the mechanical enforcement of the rule that patients must pay before being admitted to the hospital at the Hui County People's Hospital in Henan Province, as well as the serious incident of a patient's death due to the irresponsibility of certain staff members.

    The Party and government leaders and hospital staff in Hui County have taken the newspaper's criticism seriously. County Chief Xi Guanghua personally went to the hospital to lead the handling of the incident and ordered the relevant derelict personnel to make a public self-criticism. All hospital staff members spent a week studying and discussing the newspaper's criticism and formulated specific methods and necessary systems for improving their work. The Henan Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office Health Section also made the Hui County hospital incident a key topic of discussion at a meeting of health section chiefs and hospital directors from all counties in the prefecture. They examined the bourgeois medical work style existing in the health departments in light of the situation in each county and proposed methods for rectification.

    The attitude and approach of the Hui County People's Hospital and its leading organs toward the newspaper's criticism are correct and should be welcomed. However, the newspaper's criticism of the Hui County People's Hospital has created an undesirable misconception among some people. That is: some people mistakenly believe that the Hui County People's Hospital was criticized for asking patients for money, so from now on, medical treatment can be obtained without paying. For example, a family member of a cadre from the Hui County Tax Bureau refused to pay after receiving medical treatment. When the hospital asked him for money, he said, "Still asking for money? The criticism in the newspaper was too light!" And the staff of the Hui County People's Hospital, having been criticized by the newspaper for their mechanical enforcement of the system, no longer dared to insist on the normal charging system, resulting in outstanding debts of more than 5,600 yuan in August and September alone, which affected the hospital's business development.

    In our daily work and life, shortcomings and mistakes are inevitable, so we need to constantly engage in criticism and self-criticism. Newspapers should criticize typical and serious shortcomings and mistakes, as well as general shortcomings and mistakes. However, some of our staff members have an incorrect view: it seems that once criticized by the newspaper, they are completely useless and can no longer hold their heads up. The fact that some people in Hui County do not pay when they see a doctor at the hospital, in addition to the selfish desire to take advantage of public resources, also reflects this incorrect view of newspaper criticism. The Hui County People's Hospital has accepted the newspaper's criticism, improved its work system, and stipulated that patients with acute and serious illnesses who cannot temporarily pay the hospitalization fee can postpone payment and receive treatment first. We should welcome this reform of the Hui County People's Hospital and should never undermine the normal rules and regulations of the hospital because of it.

    不要破坏医院正常的制度
    郑高
    8月13日人民日报第四版发表的“三十块钱重要呢？一个人的生命重要呢？”一文，批评了河南省辉县人民医院机械执行病人入院必须缴费的制度以及某些工作人员不负责任以致造成病人死亡的严重事件。
    辉县的党政领导同志和医院的工作人员对报纸的批评都很重视。县长席光华亲自到医院领导处理这一事件，责令有关失职人员作了公开检讨。全院工作人员对报纸的批评进行了一周的学习和讨论，并订出了改进工作的具体办法和必要制度。河南新乡专员公署卫生科也在全专区各县卫生科长、院长会议上对辉县医院事件作了重点讨论，并联系各县情况检查了卫生部门存在的资产阶级医疗作风，提出了改正的办法。
    辉县人民医院和它的领导机关对待报纸的批评所持的态度和做法是正确的，是应该受到欢迎的。但是，报纸对辉县人民医院的批评在一部分人中却产生了不应有的错觉，这就是：有些人错误地认为辉县人民医院是因为向病人要钱受到批评的，因此今后看病就可以不花钱了。如辉县税务局一个干部的家属看完了病后不给钱，医院向他要钱的时候，却说：“还要钱呢？报上登（批评）的还轻？”而辉县人民医院的工作人员，由于受到了报纸对他们机械执行制度的批评，连正常的收费制度也不敢坚持了，以致在八、九两月外欠款就达五千六百元之多，影响了医院业务的开展。
    在我们的日常工作和生活中不可避免地会有缺点和错误，因此就需要经常地进行批评和自我批评。报纸对典型的严重的缺点和错误要批评，对一般的缺点和错误也同样要批评，但是在我们某些工作人员中，却有这样一种不正确的看法：好像一被报纸批评了就再一无是处，就再也抬不起头来。辉县的某些人到医院看病不给钱，除去占公家的便宜的思想在作怪以外，也反映了对报纸批评的这种不正确的看法。辉县人民医院接受了报纸的批评，改进了工作制度，规定急重病人入院治疗暂时缴不出住院费的可以缓缴，先治病后缴费。我们应该欢迎辉县人民医院的这种改革，绝不应该因此破坏医院的正常的规章制度。
