Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 17th: The Henan Province Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Work Conference recently decided to launch a mass livestock protection and love movement throughout the province this winter and next spring to enhance livestock physique and ensure their safe overwintering. Due to severe flooding in some areas during the summer and autumn rainy seasons, a large amount of crop stalks and straws that could be used as livestock feed have rotted. Of the province's existing more than seven million head of livestock, it is estimated that there is still a shortage of 1.7 billion catties of fodder. Livestock sheds in disaster areas that were flooded and collapsed have not yet been fully rebuilt. Livestock management in some areas is currently inadequate, and epidemics still occur from time to time. Therefore, during the livestock protection and love movement this winter and next spring, the conference called on non-disaster areas to continue to strengthen livestock physique, ensure that most livestock reach a medium level of fatness or above, and strive for full fatness; disaster areas should prevent the spread of livestock epidemics and resolutely stop the phenomenon of livestock becoming weak and dying.

To achieve the above requirements, the conference pointed out that all localities should further strengthen ideological education on livestock protection and love for farmers, especially feeders, conscientiously implement mutually beneficial policies and various reward systems for protecting and breeding livestock, and seize favorable opportunities to do a good job in storing and protecting grass. The conference believes that agricultural cooperatives in various localities should clarify the surplus or shortage of fodder by formulating storage and grass use plans, and adjust with each other in a planned way. Cooperatives in disaster areas with greater difficulties in fodder can organize livestock to graze in areas with more grass or foster them elsewhere. All localities should conduct a general inspection of livestock pens and actively prepare for wind and cold protection equipment. In terms of feeding management, the contract system and the method of feeding in groups and in separate troughs should be earnestly promoted according to the different types and sizes, strengths and weaknesses of livestock. In addition, the conference also conducted special research on how to strengthen the leadership of livestock work and unite traditional Chinese veterinarians.

More than 1,300 animal husbandry and veterinary workers from various localities participated in the conference. They also extensively exchanged experiences in livestock feeding management, breeding, and epidemic prevention and control.

    河南重视保护牲畜过冬
    决定在全省开展保畜爱畜运动
    据新华社郑州17日电　最近举行的河南省畜牧兽医工作会议，决定今冬明春在全省开展群众性的保畜爱畜运动，以增强牲畜体质，保证牲畜安全过冬。由于夏、秋雨季部分地区连续遭受严重的水灾，许多可以用作牲畜饲草的农作物秆秸大量霉坏，全省现有七百多万头牲畜，据估算仍缺饲草十七亿斤。灾区被淹倒塌的畜舍，还没有完全修建起来。部分地区目前牲畜管理不善，疫病仍不时发生。因此在今冬明春的保畜爱畜运动中，会议要求非灾区继续增强牲畜体质，保证大部牲畜达到中等膘以上，争取全膘；灾区防止牲畜疫病蔓延，坚决制止牲畜瘦弱死亡的现象。
    为实现上述要求，这次会议指出，各地应当进一步加强对农民特别是饲养员的保畜爱畜的思想教育，认真贯彻执行互利政策以及保护和繁殖牲畜的各项奖励制度，抓紧有利时机做好储草、保草工作。会议认为，各地农业社要通过制定储草和用草规划，弄清饲草余缺情况，有计划地相互调剂。灾区饲草困难较大的社，可以组织牲畜到草多地区就食或寄养。各地对于牲畜厩舍要普遍检查一次，积极做好防风御寒设备。在饲养管理上，要根据牲畜的不同种类和大小、强弱等，认真推行包干制度和分组、分槽喂养的办法。此外，对于如何加强牲畜工作的领导和团结中兽医等问题，会议也作了专门的研究。
    参加这次会议的各地畜牧兽医工作人员共一千三百多人。他们还广泛交流了牲畜的饲养管理、繁殖和疫病防治等经验。
