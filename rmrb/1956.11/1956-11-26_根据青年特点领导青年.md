    Leading Youth According to Their Characteristics
    Yi Qin
    Our Party has always attached great importance to the role of youth and the Youth League organization in the life of the country. Over the past few years, under the correct leadership of the Party, the Chinese Communist Youth League has not only established a nationwide organization with 20 million members, but also united the vast number of young people through the Youth League organization, actively participated in the country's and society's political, economic, and cultural life, and correctly played the role of the Party's assistant. The political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and the new Party Constitution adopted by the Congress highly appraised the youth of our country, and at the same time required Party organizations at all levels to closely care for the ideological and organizational work of the Youth League.
    How can Party organizations implement the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress" and further lead the work of the Youth League? The key still lies in carrying out work according to the characteristics of youth. During the Second National Congress of the Youth League in June 1953, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong clearly instructed that, in addition to continuing to cooperate with the Party's central tasks, the Youth League should also have independent work suitable for the characteristics of youth. In the past few years, many local Party organizations, in leading the work of the Youth League, have, in accordance with this instruction of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, carried out various independent activities of the Youth League according to the characteristics of the youth. However, in some places, this problem has not been solved to this day.
    What is the reason that prevents Party organizations from leading the work of the Youth League according to the characteristics of youth?
    This is because many local Party organizations only see the commonality of youth and other masses, and do not see the uniqueness of youth, only emphasizing that youth should participate in the Party's central tasks, while neglecting to lead the Youth League to carry out independent activities according to the requirements of the central tasks, and even believing that carrying out independent activities will affect the Party's central tasks and is an act of seeking independence from the Party. Therefore, there is insufficient support and too many restrictions. This spring, when the cadres of the Youth League County Committee of Huanglong County, Shaanxi Province, asked the County Party Committee to hold a meeting of full-time cadres of the Youth League to study the work of the League, the County Party Secretary actually said: "They are all revolutionary work, why emphasize the work of one's own department? When we reach the Communist society, won't the Youth League still get credit?" A small number of Party organizations only grasp the cadres of the Youth League, but do not grasp the organization of the Youth League. As a result, all the League cadres are "unified" to engage in central tasks or fixed in one place to engage in a specific work, and the Youth League organization exists only in name, losing normal contact with the vast number of young people. In Guixi County, Jiangxi Province, from August 1955 to May 1956, for a full ten months, there were no cadres doing the work of the Youth League specifically. Although a cadre was assigned in February of this year, before taking office, he was transferred to do archival work. Obviously, this kind of thinking and practice of some Party organizations has greatly damaged the enthusiasm and creativity of the Youth League and weakened the role of the League organization.
    Youth, as a mass, do have common points with other masses. Therefore, young workers should participate in trade unions, and young farmers should participate in agricultural producers' cooperatives. However, youth after all have characteristics unique to youth, such as enthusiasm, initiative, courage, optimism, etc. Youth also have many problems that general adults have already solved and that young people have not yet begun to feel, such as seeking knowledge, growing up, love, marriage, and so on. These special problems cannot be completely solved by general mass organizations. If attention is not paid to solving them or they are not solved well, it will affect the exertion of youth's enthusiasm. Therefore, the reason why our Party wants to establish a Youth League organization in addition to other mass organizations and emphasizes leading the Youth League to carry out independent activities is to attach importance to these characteristics of youth, pay attention to solving the special problems of youth, and give play to the special role of youth. If the Youth League and other mass organizations only have commonality and no particularity, then why have a Youth League organization? And why emphasize carrying out independent activities?
    The Party Central Committee pointed out in the "Instructions to Party Committees at All Levels on Strengthening the Party's Leadership over the Youth League": "The more the Youth League can adopt various methods suitable for the characteristics of youth to carry out work among young people, the more it can unite and educate the vast number of young people to actively participate in the Party's central work." Isn't this clearly stated? The League organization should be allowed to carry out activities according to its own characteristics. This kind of activity not only does not conflict with the Party's central work, but also helps to complete the Party's central work. The situation in Lixian County, Hebei Province, which was introduced by the China Youth Daily some time ago, provides us with some useful experiences and lessons. The work of the Youth League in Lixian County was not very active before May of last year. At that time, due to neglecting to carry out the League's independent activities according to the characteristics of youth, the vast majority of full-time League cadres were transferred to do other work, and they were stationed at points or contracted villages for a long time. The League cadres could not move, and the daily work of many district and township League organizations was "contracted" by the Party District Committee or the Party Branch. What was the result? The League organization was disconnected from top to bottom, and there was no communication. The work of the League organization came to a standstill. Later, the Lixian County Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted an inspection, changed its leadership methods, boldly assigned tasks to the League organization according to the characteristics of youth, and led the youth to carry out various activities. In this way, the League cadres became more energetic and the work became more active. For example, in the second half of last year, the County Party Committee specifically asked the Youth League to lead the youth to do a good job in corn artificial pollination, land reclamation, fertilizer accumulation, and elimination of the four pests. As a result, these tasks were completed very well. They completed more than 66,000 mu of corn artificial pollination, more than doubling the task given by the Party, and reclaimed more than 4,800 mu of wasteland in seventeen days. This spring, the League also led the youth to dig more than 4,500 brick wells, accounting for about 75% of the total number of wells dug in the county. It can be seen from this that carrying out independent activities according to the characteristics of youth will not hinder the central work, but will be able to unite and educate the vast number of young people to actively participate in the central work; it is not "seeking independence," but it will be able to make the youth truly become an active shock force under the unified leadership of the Party.
    Some people worry that if activities are carried out according to the characteristics of youth, will some League organizations experience a phenomenon where they are not in sync with the steps of the relevant departments? This is possible. But this phenomenon can be prevented as long as the Party organization strengthens ideological leadership, and the League organization will not seek independence from the Party organization, but will obey the unified leadership of the Party.
    Some Party organizations, although they can see the characteristics of young people, are still unwilling to give play to the characteristics of young people. They say: Young men are good, but they are "inexperienced" and "enthusiastic but lack experience." Therefore, if they are not strictly controlled, they will make mistakes. This statement is also incorrect. As long as a person does not stop breathing, it is impossible to never make mistakes. Moreover, because young people are young and have just embarked on the road of life, lacking experience in struggle and ideological cultivation, they are more likely to make mistakes than adults and old people. What is so strange about this? Therefore, we should not "be afraid of young people making mistakes," but should strengthen the leadership of the League organization, do more education and encouragement, and do less simple criticism and accusations, so that they make fewer mistakes or do not make big mistakes; and be able to correct their mistakes quickly after they have made them. The Lixian County Committee is an example. The County Committee strengthened the leadership of the League in many ways. In addition to a member of the County Committee concurrently managing the work of the League, it was also decided that the positive and negative secretaries of the County and District League Committees (not members of the Party Committee at the same level) should attend the Party Committee meetings at the same level, so that they can understand the intentions of the leaders at any time and correctly arrange the work of the League. In order to facilitate the correct implementation of the instructions of the County League Committee by the grass-roots League organizations, the County Party Committee added comments to some important plans and instructions of the League Committee, so that the League organization would not be likely to make mistakes. What should we do with the League organizations that have already made mistakes? We should only strengthen leadership and help them correct their mistakes.
    Of course, on the other hand, the League organization should also humbly listen to the opinions of the Party organization, and try to avoid making fewer mistakes and not making big mistakes, so as to more correctly complete the Party's tasks.
    The Eighth National Congress of the Party ended almost two months ago, and Party organizations at all levels are currently checking subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism in accordance with the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress." We enthusiastically hope that Party organizations at all levels can also check the problems that exist in leading the work of the Youth League, so that the work of the League can better implement the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress." We believe that in the near future, a new atmosphere will appear in the work of the Youth League in various places.

    根据青年特点领导青年
    宜勤
    我们党从来就十分重视青年和青年团组织在国家生活中的作用。几年以来，我国青年团在党的正确领导下，不仅建立了一个拥有二千万团员的全国性的组织，而且通过团组织团结了广大青年，积极地参加了国家的和社会的政治生活、经济生活和文化生活，正确地发挥了党的助手作用。这次党的第八次全国代表大会的政治报告和大会所通过的新党章，对我国青年作了极高的估价，同时要求各级党组织密切地关怀青年团的思想工作和组织工作。
    党组织如何贯彻“八大”精神，进一步领导好青年团工作呢？关键仍旧在于按照青年特点进行工作。在1953年6月青年团第二次全国代表大会期间，党中央和毛泽东同志就曾明确指示，青年团除了应继续配合党的中心工作以外，还要有适合青年特点的独立工作。在过去几年中，许多地方党组织在领导青年团工作中，已经按照党中央和毛泽东同志的这一指示，根据青年的特点，开展了青年团的多种多样的独立活动。但是，也有一些地方，至今还没有解决这一问题。
    是什么原因障碍着党组织去根据青年的特点来领导团组织的工作呢？
    这就因为不少地方的党组织只看到青年和其他群众共同性的一面，没有看到青年特殊性的一面，只强调青年应该参加党的中心工作，而忽视根据中心工作的要求，来领导青年团开展独立活动，甚至认为开展独立活动，会影响党的中心工作，是向党闹独立性。因此支持不足，限制过多。今年春天，陕西省黄龙县团县委的干部向党委要求开团的专职干部会，研究团的工作，县委书记竟然说：“都是革命工作嘛，何必强调本部门的工作呢？将来到了共产主义社会，还没团的功劳吗？”少数党组织只抓团的干部，不抓团的组织，结果团干部统统被“统”去搞中心工作或者固定在一个地方搞一个具体工作，团组织名存实亡，失去了和广大青年的正常联系。江西省贵溪县，自1955年8月至1956年5月，整整十个月没有专做团的工作的干部。今年2月虽然给配备了一名干部，可是，还没有到职，又被调去搞档案工作。显然，某些党组织的这种想法和做法，已经大大地伤害了青年团的积极性创造性，削弱了团组织的作用。
    青年，作为一个群众来讲，和其他群众确实有共同的地方，因此，青年工人应该参加工会，青年农民应该参加农业生产合作社。但是，青年毕竟具有青年所独有的特点，比如热情、积极、勇敢、乐观等。青年还有许多一般成年人所早已解决、少年人还没有开始感到的问题，如求知识、长身体、恋爱、婚姻等等问题，这些特殊问题就不是一般的群众组织所能完全解决的。如果不注意解决或者解决得不好，就会影响到青年积极性的发挥。因此，我们党之所以要在其他群众组织之外，再建立一个青年团的组织，并且强调领导青年团开展独立活动，就是为了重视青年的这些特点，注意解决青年的特殊问题，发挥青年的特殊作用。如果青年团和其他群众组织只有共同性而没有特殊性，又何必要青年团这样一个组织呢？更又何必强调开展独立活动呢？
    党中央在“关于加强党对青年团的领导给各级党委的指示”中已经指出：“青年团愈能采取多种多样的适合青年特点的方法在青年中进行工作，就愈能团结和教育广大青年群众来积极参加党的中心工作”。这不是说得很清楚了吗？应该让团组织按照自己的特点来进行活动，这种活动不仅和党的中心工作没有矛盾，而且有助于党的中心工作的完成。前些日子中国青年报所介绍的河北省蠡县的情况，为我们提供了一些有益的经验教训。蠡县的青年团工作，在去年5月以前是不大活跃的。当时，由于忽视按照青年特点，开展团的独立活动，把绝大部分团的专职干部调去做其他工作，并且长期蹲点或包村，团干部动不了，许多区、乡团的日常工作，就由党区委或党支部“包揽”起来。结果呢？团的组织上下断线，互不通气，团组织的工作便停顿起来。后来中共蠡县县委进行了检查，改变了领导方法，根据青年特点，大胆地分配给团组织任务，领导青年开展了各种活动，这样团的干部劲头就大了，工作也活跃起来了。例如在去年下半年，县委特别要求青年团领导青年做好玉米人工授粉、开荒、积肥、除四害等工作，结果，这些任务都完成得很好。他们完成了玉米人工授粉六万六千多亩，超过了党所给予的任务的一倍，并在十七天内开荒四千八百多亩。今年春天，团又领导青年挖砖井四千五百多眼，占全县挖井总数的75％左右。由此可见，按照青年特点，开展独立活动，并不会妨碍中心工作，而是更能团结和教育广大青年来积极参加中心工作；并不是“闹独立性”，而是更能在党的统一领导下，使青年真正成为一支活跃的突击力量。
    照青年的特点进行活动，有的人耽心有好些团组织会不会发生和各个有关部门步调不够一致的现象呢？有这种可能。但是这种现象是可以防止的，只要党组织加强思想领导，团组织不会向党组织闹独立性，而会服从党的统一领导的。
    也有些地方的党组织虽然能够看到青年人的特点，但是，他们也仍然不愿意发挥青年的特点。他们说：青年小伙子好是好，就是“嘴上没毛，做事不牢”、“热情有余，经验不足”，因此，不控制得严一点，他们就会发生错误。这种说法也是不对的。一个人只要在没有停止呼吸的时候，就不可能绝对不犯错误，何况青年人究竟因为他们年青，刚刚走上生活的道路，缺少斗争经验，缺少思想修养，因此，也就有可能比成年人、老年人容易犯错误，这又有什么可以奇怪的。所以不应该“怕青年人犯错误”，而应该是加强对团组织的领导，多做教育多鼓励，少做简单的批评和指责，使他们少犯错误或不犯大错误；犯了错误以后能够很快纠正。蠡县县委就是一个例子。县委从多方面加强了对团的领导，县委除有一个委员兼管团的工作外，并决定县、区团委的正副书记（不是同级党委委员）列席同级党委会议，使他们能随时领会领导意图，正确安排团的工作。为便于基层团组织正确贯彻执行团县委的指示，团委有些重要的计划和指示，县委都加了批语，这样团组织就不大会发生错误。对于已经发生错误的团组织怎么办呢？也只应该加强领导，帮助他们改正错误。
    当然，在另一方面，团组织也应该虚心听取党组织的意见，尽力避免少犯错误不犯大错误，从而更加正确地完成党的任务。
    党的第八次全国代表大会结束了快两个月了，各级党组织目前正在根据“八大”精神，检查主观主义，官僚主义和宗派主义，我们热情地希望各级党组织也能同时检查一下在领导青年团工作中所存在的问题，从而使团的工作更好地贯彻“八大”精神。我们相信，在不久的将来，各地青年团工作将会出现一番新气象。
