Xinhua News Agency, November 13th -- According to TASS, Rome, November 12th: Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti delivered a speech at a mass rally in Perugia, Italy, on November 11th to celebrate the 39th anniversary of the October Revolution. He spoke about the development of the international communist movement and especially about the Hungarian incident.

Togliatti pointed out that the great October Socialist Revolution of 1917 in Russia broke open a link in the chains of world imperialism and capitalism. Since then, the world communist movement has grown stronger. At the same time, capitalist countries are attempting to reverse the great movement of people in former colonies to strive for complete independence and freedom, attempting to prevent the trend of international tension from easing, and plunging the world back into the vortex of the Cold War. They are also attempting to prevent the people of countries building socialism from moving forward.

Togliatti said that in all countries ruled by communists, the existing foundation of the regime is expanding, and the country is advancing along the road of socialism. After the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, some countries immediately realized what work needed to be done to adapt to the current situation, while other countries did not understand this principle and postponed the process. Togliatti criticized the mistakes made by the former Hungarian leaders in the work of building socialism. He said that at the beginning of the Hungarian incident, the people expressed some dissatisfaction with the mistakes made by the Hungarian leaders in the past. However, class enemies attempted to use this movement to organize armed riots to overthrow the socialist system.

Togliatti said that it was not only correct but also necessary for the Soviet army to help the Kadar Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, at the request of the government, to put down the white terror in the country. The Soviet assistance saved the foundation of the Hungarian socialist regime and prevented a dangerous provocation and source of war from appearing on the border of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.

Togliatti also talked about the situation in Italy. He pointed out that in recent times, reactionary forces and fascists have become rampant. But the working class will forcefully counter all conspiracies and provocations.

Xinhua News Agency, November 13th -- According to TASS, Paris, November 12th: "L'Humanité" published an article by French Communist Party Secretary Duclos commenting on the Hungarian incident. Duclos said: "Representatives of reactionary and fascist forces have stirred up sensational clamor around the Hungarian incident. On the Hungarian incident, they have gained the support of the leaders of the Socialist Party, and they have been using their newspapers and national radio stations to propagate to people that the Hungarian counter-revolution still maintains a considerable military presence. Their purpose is to create favorable conditions for foreign interference in Hungary's internal affairs."

Duclos emphasized: "War provocateurs are trying to create an excuse for interference in the internal affairs of this country. For the sake of peace, the people of all countries should stop this interference."

    陶里亚蒂和杜克洛在评论匈牙利事件时指出
    必须反击战争挑拨者干涉阴谋
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社罗马12日讯：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂11日在意大利柏鲁基亚市庆祝十月革命三十九周年的群众集会上发表了演说，谈到国际共产主义运动的发展，并且特别谈到匈牙利事件。
    陶里亚蒂指出，1917年伟大的十月社会主义革命在俄国把世界帝国主义和资本主义的锁链打开了一个环节。从那时以来，世界共产主义运动壮大起来了。同时，资本主义国家企图使旧日殖民地的人民争取完全独立和自由的巨大运动倒退，企图阻止国际紧张局势的趋向缓和，使世界重新陷入冷战的漩涡。他们还企图阻止正在建设社会主义的各国人民向前迈进。
    陶里亚蒂说，在一切共产党人当政的国家里，政权的现有基础正在扩大，国家正在沿着社会主义的道路前进。在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后，有一些国家立刻认识到必须做些什么工作来适应目前的形势，而另一些国家就没有懂得这个道理，并且推延这个进程。陶里亚蒂批评匈牙利前领导人在建设社会主义的工作中所犯的错误。他说，匈牙利事件发生之初，人民是对匈牙利领导人过去所犯的错误表现了某种不满情绪。然而，阶级敌人企图利用这个运动来组织武装暴动，以推翻社会主义制度。
    陶里亚蒂说，苏联军队应卡达尔的工农革命政府的要求帮助这个政府扑灭国内的白色恐怖，不仅是正确的，而且是必要的。苏联的帮助挽救了匈牙利社会主义政权的基础，防止了一个危险的挑衅和战争的策源地出现在苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和南斯拉夫的边境上。
    陶里亚蒂还谈到意大利的局势。他指出，最近一个时期，反动势力和法西斯分子猖狂起来。但是工人阶级将有力地反击一切阴谋和挑衅。
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社巴黎12日讯：“人道报”刊载了法国共产党书记杜克洛评述匈牙利事件的文章。杜克洛说：“反动派和法西斯势力的代表人物围绕匈牙利事件掀起了耸人听闻的喧嚷。在匈牙利事件上，他们获得了社会党领袖的支持，他们一直通过自己的报纸和国家广播电台向人们宣传说，匈牙利的反革命还保有相当大的军事阵地。他们的目的在于为外国干涉匈牙利内政创造良好条件。”
    杜克洛强调说：“战争挑拨者企图制造对这个国家内政的干涉是没有任何借口的。为了和平的利益，各国人民应该制止这种干涉。”
