One Person Offers a Good Idea

The Xinnong First Agricultural Cooperative in Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, initiated a "One Person Offers a Good Idea" campaign, and the cooperative members put forward more than one hundred suggestions. Among the suggestions, twenty-one types of sideline businesses were found to be feasible, which could increase income by more than 35,000 yuan.

After seeing the benefits of promoting democracy, the cooperative cadres of Xinnong First Cooperative have listed soliciting opinions from cooperative members as a regular task. The picture shows cooperative director Yuan Shengui (first person on the left) soliciting opinions from cooperative members.
