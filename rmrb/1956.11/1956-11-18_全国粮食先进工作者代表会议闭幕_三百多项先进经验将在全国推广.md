At this thirteen-day meeting, more than 700 representatives exchanged 796 advanced experiences related to grain procurement, storage, supply, processing, transportation, oils and fats, and planning statistics. More than 330 of these advanced experiences will be promoted nationwide.

All the representatives attending the meeting also proposed eleven initiatives to launch an advanced worker movement to the staff of all grain work departments nationwide. The initiatives require grain workers across the country to earnestly implement and master the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, and to do a good job in grain production and supply.

Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian spoke at today's meeting. He encouraged all the representatives attending the meeting to maintain closer ties with the masses in their work and to conscientiously do their work better. Li Xiannian called on grain workers across the country to further tap the potential of their work and take the lead in participating in the movement to increase production and practice economy, improve business management in all business aspects, and save grain and accumulate funds for the country.

Vice Minister of Food Gao Jinchun delivered the closing speech. He said that the advanced experiences exchanged at this meeting, due to the adoption of methods such as conference exchanges combined with visits to the exhibition hall of advanced experiences in grain work, enabled the representatives to deeply and specifically understand each advanced experience.

At the closing ceremony, Minister of Food Zhang Naiqi, on behalf of the Ministry of Food, awarded bonuses and certificates to the advanced workers and representatives of advanced units attending the meeting.

During the meeting, Soviet expert Danilin, who works at the Ministry of Food, gave a report to all representatives on the grain food storage business and the flour milling, rice milling, and mixed feed industries of the Soviet Grain Products Department in the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan. Professors, engineers, and researchers from relevant research institutions who were invited to participate in the meeting also held discussions on issues such as grain processing and storage.
