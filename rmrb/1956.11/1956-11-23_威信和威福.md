Title: Prestige and Abuse of Power

Since liberation, leaders and cadres at all levels of the Party and the government have enjoyed extremely high prestige in the hearts of the people throughout the country. Within the organs, leaders also enjoy high prestige in the hearts of the cadres. This is a new atmosphere, a good atmosphere, in the new China.

However, in some places, a very small number of leaders and cadres still have some misunderstandings about prestige, believing that speaking is final, saying east is not west, being wrong is also right, and doing wrong is also right is having prestige. If subordinates have their own opinions, and the people have dissenting views, they are all considered to be attacking the leadership, undermining prestige, or having no respect for the leadership, and resisting the organization.

These very few people often reduce prestige in order to increase prestige; lose prestige in order to gain prestige. Because their behavior has nothing to do with establishing prestige, they are similar to the so-called "ministers of power and fortune" in ancient times, wielding power and acting arbitrarily, even infringing on the rights of citizens and forcing people to death. This style of wielding power and acting arbitrarily has reached a very serious level in a very few places.

A comrade from the Nanjing Geological Exploration Company submitted a manuscript to "New Observation," and the company's leaders retaliated by repeatedly attacking the author in the year-end appraisal and job assignment, and at the Party branch meeting, forcing the "New Observation" editorial department to come forward to prove the author's innocence (see "New Observation" No. 22, page 27, this year). May I ask, is this behavior of the company's leaders increasing prestige, or wielding power and acting arbitrarily?

The district chief, township head, and Party branch secretary of Yuezhuang District, Yiyuan County, Shandong Province, suppressed criticism, retaliated barbarically, and illegally humiliated, hung up, and controlled Zheng Zhimei, the glorious family member of a martyr (see "People's Daily," August 29). Township cadres in Taitou Village, Wu District, Ding County, Hebei Province, extorted "red tickets" from the theater troupe. When they failed to achieve their goal, they ordered the troupe to stop performing, and incited the masses to disrupt theater order and injure more than 20 actors (see "People's Daily," November 9). The arbitrary and tyrannical behavior of these people is a further step than the behavior of the leaders of the Nanjing Geological Exploration Company.

However, even more serious are some cases of forcing people to death, such as: Liu Yunzhen, the head of a health section in Liaoning Province, persecuted nurse Lan Peichu (see "People's Daily," October 21); the district party secretary and members of Tuqiao District, Huangmei County, Hubei Province, interfered with freedom of marriage, causing two communists to sacrifice their lives (see "People's Daily," November 1); Li Yanshou, the director of a state-owned farm in Changshan County, Zhejiang Province, forced orders, causing an excellent worker to commit suicide (see "People's Daily," November 2).

The style of the above-mentioned farm director, district party secretary and members, and health section chief has nothing to do with establishing prestige. They are just acting arbitrarily, wielding power and acting arbitrarily, alienating themselves from the masses, and violating the principles of the Party!

They either do not understand, or have forgotten what prestige is. Marxists and Leninists believe that prestige is to be won by reason and humility. Prestige cannot be exchanged for arrogance, let alone forced by wielding power and acting arbitrarily.

To strive for prestige, one must rely on reason and humility; to maintain prestige, one must also rely on reason and humility. Arrogance does not necessarily have good results, but wielding power and acting arbitrarily will certainly bring misfortune.

It is easy for leaders and cadres to have "power." They can always show off their power to subordinates and the people; it is not easy to have "trust," to gain the trust of subordinates and the people. Showing off power does not necessarily gain the trust of subordinates and the people; wielding power and acting arbitrarily will certainly not gain the trust of subordinates and the people.

Only true prestige can make subordinates and the people submit willingly. Otherwise, subordinates and the people will obey superficially but not sincerely, dare not criticize in person, but criticize fiercely behind their backs. What is the value of such "prestige"?

Prestige with a mass base is true prestige, consolidated prestige. And the mass base of prestige is to be built with "caring for the masses," and cannot be piled up with "wielding power and acting arbitrarily."

Prestige and wielding power and acting arbitrarily are opposite and not complementary. The more one wields power and acts arbitrarily, the less prestige one has. Leaders and cadres with prestige should cherish prestige at all times and avoid wielding power and acting arbitrarily at all times. The Party, the government, and the people will always cherish those with prestige and will never tolerate those who wield power and act arbitrarily.

### 威信和威福

    威信和威福
    高植
    解放以后，党和政府的各级领导和干部，在全国人民的心目中，享有极其崇高的威信。在机关内部，领导者也在干部的心目中，享有崇高的威信。这是新中国的新气象，好气象。
    但是在某些地方，还有很少数的领导者和干部，对于威信还有些误解，以为说一不二，说东不西，说错了也对，做错了也对，才是有威信。若是下级有自己的主张，人民有反对的意见，就一律认为是打击领导，破坏威信，或是目无领导，反抗组织。
    这些很少数的人，往往为了增加威信，反而减少了威信；为了争取威信，反而丧失了威信。因为他们的行为已经和建立威信无关，他们已类似古代的所谓“威福之臣”，是在作威作福，甚至侵犯公民权利、逼死人命了。这种威福作风，在极少数的地方，到了很严重的程度。
    南京地质勘探公司的一位同志在“新观察”上投了稿，公司的领导就加以报复，在年终鉴定和分配工作上，在党支部大会上，一再打击作者，使得“新观察”编辑部不得不出面证明作者无罪（见本年“新观察”第22期，27页）。请问，公司领导的这种行为，是增加威信呢，是作威作福呢？
    山东沂源县悦庄区的区长、乡长、党支部书记，压制批评，野蛮报复，违法地凌辱、吊打、管制光荣的烈士家属郑志美（见8月29日“人民日报”）。河北省定县五区台头村的乡干部们，向剧团勒索“红票”，不达目的，便勒令剧团停演，并鼓动群众破坏剧场秩序，打伤演员二十多人（见11月9日“人民日报”）。这些人的作威作福的行为，比南京地质勘探公司的领导的行为，是更进一步了。
    然而更严重的是还有一些逼死人命的事，例如：辽宁省的一个卫生科科长刘云振，迫害女护士兰培初（见10月21日“人民日报”）；湖北省黄梅县土桥区区委书记和委员们干涉婚姻自由，使两个共产党员牺牲（见11月1日“人民日报”）；浙江常山县国营农场场长李延寿强迫命令，使一个优秀工人自杀（见11月2日“人民日报”）。
    上述的农场场长、区委书记和委员、卫生科科长的作风，同建立威信毫不相干，他们只是一意孤行，作威作福，脱离群众，违背了党的原则！
    他们或者是不了解，或者是忘记了什么是威信。马克思列宁主义者认为，威信是要凭理智和谦逊去争取的。威信不是威风可以换取的，更不是作威作福可以逼取到手的。
    争取威信，要凭理智和谦逊；维护威信，也要凭理智和谦逊。威风不一定有好结果，而作威作福却一定会带来不幸。
    领导者和干部，要有“威”是很容易的，可以随时向下级向人民摆摆威风；要有“信”，要得到下级和人民的信任，就不容易了。摆摆威风，不一定得到下级和人民的信任；作威作福，却一定得不到下级和人民的信任。
    只有真正的威信，才能使下级和人民心服乐从。不然的话，下级和人民，面服心不服，当面不敢批评，背后大事抨击。那样的“威信”又有什么价值？
    有群众基础的威信，才是真正的威信，巩固的威信。而威信的群众基础，是要用“关心群众”去建立的，是不能用“作威作福”去堆砌的。
    威信和作威作福是相反而不相成的。越是作威作福，越没有威信。有威信的领导者和干部，既要处处爱惜威信，又要时时戒绝作威作福。党、政府、人民，永远爱护有威信的人，绝不姑息作威作福的人。
