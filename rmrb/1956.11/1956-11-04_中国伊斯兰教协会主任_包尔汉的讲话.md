Brothers and sisters, comrades, and friends from all walks of life!

While people from all walks of life in our country are holding a conference in our capital, British and French imperialists and their accomplice Israel are carrying out robbery activities of killing and arson in Egypt. Ignoring the sacred rights of the Asian and African people stipulated by the Asian-African Conference a year ago and the condemnation of peace-loving people all over the world, the British and French imperialists and their accomplice Israel openly violated the United Nations Charter and launched a war of aggression against Egypt, threatening the safety of the world's humanity. This barbaric act of aggression by British and French imperialism, which undermines Egyptian sovereignty, has aroused the anger of the Egyptian and Arab people, as well as the anger of all peace-loving people around the world. The Egyptian people and the Arab people have urgently mobilized and are heroically resisting the aggression of British and French imperialism and its accomplice Israel. British and French imperialism is trying to grab a straw to save their lives after falling into the water, but the result will inevitably be to drown even deeper.

Egypt and the Arab people have a glorious history of fighting to safeguard their independence and sovereignty, and they have awakened. The era in which British and French imperialism used deception, instigation, and the creation of colonial markets in Asian and African countries is over. British and French imperialists should understand that any attempt to restore any of their past colonies is impossible and extremely foolish. Some Asian and African countries that have just freed themselves from colonial rule are facing aggression from British and French imperialism while they are healing the serious wounds left by the colonialists and beginning to build their happy lives. They have expressed the greatest anger at this aggression. We know that war will destroy the fruits of thousands of years of hard work by all mankind and bring disaster to all mankind; therefore, all peace-loving people are angry at the British and French aggressors.

The liberation struggle of the Egyptian and Arab people is an inevitable trend in the development of human society, and no force can stop it. The British and French imperialist war of aggression is bound to "play with fire and get burned."

We, the ten million Muslims in China, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely support the statement issued by our government on the British and French armed aggression against Egypt. We also call on Muslims and peace-loving people all over the world (including the British and French people) to unite, resolutely support the heroic Egyptian people, resolutely oppose the British and French imperialist aggression against Egypt, resolutely demand that the British and French imperialists immediately stop armed intervention, immediately withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory, and resolutely demand that the United Nations take effective measures to stop the British and French imperialist aggression.

Justice is on the side of the Egyptian and Arab people. The British and French imperialist war of aggression is bound to fail, and final victory will surely belong to the just Egyptian and Arab people.

We shout:

Long live the just struggle of the Egyptian and Arab people!

    包尔汉的讲话
    各界兄弟姊妹们，同志们，朋友们！
    当我们各界人民在我国首都举行大会的时候，英法帝国主义及其走卒以色列，却在埃及进行杀人放火的强盗勾当。英、法帝国主义及其走卒以色列不顾一年前亚非会议规定的亚非人民的神圣权利和全世界爱好和平人类的斥责，公开违背联合国宪章，发动了侵略埃及的战争，威胁着世界人类的安全。英、法帝国主义的这种蛮横的、破坏埃及主权的侵略行为，不仅引起埃及和阿拉伯各国人民的愤怒，而且引起全世界所有爱好和平人类的愤怒。埃及人民和阿拉伯人民已经紧急动员起来，英勇的抵抗英法帝国主义和他的走卒以色列的侵略。英法帝国主义企图在跌入水中后抓住一根茅草救命，其结果必然淹得更深。
    埃及和阿拉伯人民，富有维护自己独立主权而斗争的光荣历史，他们已经觉醒了。英法帝国主义在亚非各国使用欺骗、挑拨，制造殖民主义市场的时代已经过去了。英法帝国主义者应该了解，企图恢复他们过去任何殖民地的行动都是不可能的、最愚蠢的。刚刚摆脱了殖民主义统治的一些亚非国家，当他们正在医治着殖民主义者遗留给他们的严重创伤，开始建设他们的幸福的生活的时候，又面临英法帝国主义的侵略，它们对这种侵略表示了最大的愤怒。我们知道，战争会摧毁全人类数千年辛勤劳动所创造的成果，会给全人类带来灾难；因此，所有爱好和平的人类都对英法侵略者表示愤怒。
    埃及和阿拉伯各国人民的解放斗争，这是人类社会发展的必然趋势，任何力量也阻挡不住。英法帝国主义的侵略战争必然是“玩火自焚”。
    我们中国一千万穆斯林同全国人民一起坚决拥护我国政府发表的关于英法武装侵略埃及的声明。我们并要求全世界穆斯林和爱好和平的人民（包括英法人民在内）团结起来，坚决支援英勇的埃及人民，坚决反对英法帝国主义对埃及的侵略，坚决要求英法帝国主义立即停止武装干涉，立即把他们的军队撤出埃及领土，坚决要求联合国迅速采取有效措施，制止英法帝国主义的侵略暴行。
    正义在埃及和阿拉伯人民方面，英法帝国主义的侵略战争必定失败，最后胜利必然属于正义的埃及人民和阿拉伯人民。
    我们高呼：
    埃及和阿拉伯各国人民的正义斗争万岁！
