    Soviet Union Launches Large-Scale Aid to Hungary
    (By our Moscow correspondent on the 11th) The Soviet people are currently transporting large quantities of grain, meat, butter, glass, cement, steel, and other supplies to Hungary. On November 9th, 3,000 tons of wheat were shipped from the southern regions of the Soviet Union. On November 10th, the Odessa Flour Mill and the Odessa Macaroni Factory sent 2,800 tons of flour and ten carloads of macaroni to Hungary. The forest areas in southern Soviet Union have delivered construction timber on schedule, and 600 carloads of firewood are also about to leave for Hungary.
    To help the Hungarian people quickly restore a peaceful life, Donbas workers are striving to complete their transportation plan ahead of schedule. Workers at the Lisichansk Glass Factory produced 50,000 square meters of glass in a short period. Workers at the Kiev Steel Plant are rushing to produce 1,500 tons of steel to be shipped to Hungary on schedule. In addition, trains loaded with various supplies are constantly leaving for Hungary from Moscow, Leningrad, Lviv, and other places.
