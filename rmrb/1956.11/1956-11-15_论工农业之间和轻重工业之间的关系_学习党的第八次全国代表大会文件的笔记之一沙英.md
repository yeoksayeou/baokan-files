I.

When we are engaged in socialist construction, because the working class leads the state power, and the economic lifeline is in the hands of the state, under the leadership of the socialist economy, the national economy has been rapidly restored and developed. In particular, the Party has determined the general line for the transition period, which makes it possible for us to lead the national economy with plans according to the goal of building socialism. With the victorious progress of the socialist revolution, the public ownership of the means of production has been expanding and consolidating, and it is even more necessary to carry out production according to a certain plan. Because the national economy is a unified and organic whole composed of numerous enterprises in many departments, without a correct and unified overall plan to lead, each acting on its own, blindly developing, without a unified goal and mutual cooperation, it is simply unimaginable to carry out socialist large-scale production. In Lenin's words: The great task of the socialist revolution is to turn the entire state economic mechanism into a large machine, into an economic organism that makes hundreds of millions of people work according to a plan. Of course, the centralized planned leadership of the national economy does not deny the necessary independence and initiative of various departments and enterprises.

To carry out planned leadership of the national economy, there must be scientific foresight. In order to avoid mistakes and make fewer mistakes, we must base our economic plans on the understanding of objective economic laws and the correct estimation of domestic and foreign conditions. This first requires us to master and be good at using the law of planned (proportionate) development of the national economy. Because this law in the socialist economy is a production regulator that meets the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism. Only by following this law, according to China's specific conditions and development trends, making the various departments interconnected, coordinated and consistent, and developing in a planned and proportionate manner, can we avoid chaos and waste, most effectively use our human, material and financial resources, and smoothly carry out production and construction, so as to obtain good results.

Our first five-year plan for guiding the development of the national economy was formulated in this way. Now this plan has been implemented for more than three years. Judging from the great achievements we have already made, thanks to the hard work of the people of the whole country, the tasks stipulated in this plan will be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule. That is to say, practice has proved that this plan is generally correct, basically in line with objective economic laws and China's actual conditions, and also in line with the requirements of the Party's general line, so it can guide the development of the national economy to achieve such great achievements. Of course, due to our lack of experience, insufficient understanding of the laws of planned economic development, and lack of comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the economic situation, coupled with the existence of many objective difficulties, this plan is not perfect, and there are still many shortcomings and errors. However, some of these shortcomings and errors have been corrected, and some still need to be overcome in the future.

Now the Party Central Committee has put forward the proposal for the second five-year plan. In this proposal, the basic tasks, main outlines and several main problems of the second five-year plan are clearly stipulated and explained. According to the specific policies and various indicators stipulated in this proposal, with the realization of the second five-year plan, China's national economy will have a huge and rapid development, preparing the necessary conditions for basically realizing the general line of the transition period during the third five-year plan period. The central task of the Party and the people of the whole country at present is to strive to overfulfill the first five-year plan and actively prepare for the second five-year plan. In order to complete this central task, according to our existing experience in economic construction, and with reference to the experience of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, we must pay attention to solving the relationship between industry and agriculture and between light and heavy industry in the future. Because this is the most important issue for us to carry out planned leadership of the national economy. If the relationship between them is not properly arranged and a disproportionate phenomenon occurs, it will have serious consequences for our socialist economic construction. Therefore, both Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report to the Eighth National Congress and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report on the proposal for the second five-year plan raised and elaborated on this issue, which deserves our attention and research.

II.

Industry and agriculture are the two most important sectors in the national economy, and stipulating the correct proportion between industry and agriculture is of paramount significance. If the proportion between industry and agriculture is not properly stipulated, making the two sectors uncoordinated, this is not just a simple technical issue, nor does it only affect the development of the national economy, but also affects the relationship between the working class and the peasants. Therefore, the relationship between industry and agriculture is a fundamental issue for building a socialist economy and a central issue for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

When studying the relationship between industry and agriculture, we should first point out that although the development of industry and agriculture is mutually dependent, mutually promoting, mutually influencing and mutually restricting, industry leads agriculture, cities lead rural areas, and the development of industry is the foundation of the development of the entire national economy. For example, we can only develop industry and provide agriculture with sufficient machines, fuel, electricity and fertilizers, so as to transform the technologically backward agriculture into modern large-scale agriculture based on advanced technology. The most important issue for us to build socialism is to build the material foundation of socialism, that is, large-scale industry. In large-scale industry, the department that produces the means of production, that is, heavy industry, occupies a decisive position. Only by developing large-scale industry, especially heavy industry, can we guarantee the transformation of the entire national economy on the basis of advanced technology, guarantee economic independence, consolidate national defense, and achieve the victory of socialism. Especially since China was originally an economically backward country, before liberation, China's modern industry accounted for only a small proportion of the national economy (in 1949, the output value of industry using machines accounted for about 17% of the total output value of industry and agriculture), and it was mainly light industry. Under this situation of extremely backward national economy, we need to develop industry, especially heavy industry. Only by developing industry, implementing socialist industrialization, and building a basically complete industrial system, so that industrial production occupies a major position in social production, and heavy industry production occupies a significant advantage in the entire industrial production, can we overcome the contradiction between China's advanced social system and backward social productive forces, and transform the poor and weak agricultural country into a rich and strong industrial country. Because of this, the Party's general line in the transition period takes the gradual realization of national socialist industrialization as the main body; our first five-year plan also takes the establishment of the initial foundation of socialist industrialization as the focus of development; our second five-year plan also regards industrial construction as the primary task in order to establish a solid foundation for socialist industrialization. This is completely correct.

Vigorously developing industry does not mean that agriculture can be ignored. We must pay enough attention to the development of agriculture. Agriculture plays an important role in ensuring that the material and cultural needs of the entire society are constantly growing. Agriculture includes grain, technical crops and animal husbandry, etc., which all occupy very important positions in the national economy. The first goal of agriculture is to produce grain. Only with the increase in grain production can we guarantee the people's need for food. China is a large country with a population of 600 million. Without the increase in grain production, it is difficult to meet and improve the people's living standards. In 1952, China's grain output was more than 320 billion catties of raw grain (including potatoes). If calculated according to the national average population, each person only got more than 500 catties of raw grain per year. This is a very low level. Now the population of cities and industrial and mining areas is about 80 million. With the development of industrialization, the population of cities and industrial and mining areas will inevitably increase rapidly, and the demand for grain and non-staple food will naturally continue to increase. In addition, in order to defend against natural disasters and various unexpected events, we must also store a sufficient amount of grain.

Our increasingly developed industry, especially light industry, needs agriculture to supply raw materials. For example, cotton, hemp, sugar cane, soybeans, peanuts, etc., are all important raw materials for industry. It can be said that about 90% or more of the raw materials for light industry rely on agriculture. Therefore, the quality of agricultural harvests directly affects the speed of growth of light industry and even the entire industry. The year with the fastest industrial growth in 1953 was the year when the total industrial output value increased by 31.7% compared with 1952, mainly because of the bumper agricultural harvest in 1952. 1955 was the year with the slowest industrial growth rate. The total industrial output value only increased by 8% compared with the previous year. The main reason was that agriculture in 1953 and 1954 did not fully complete the plan due to disasters. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "The production level of commercial grain and industrial raw materials in our country is now very low, while the country's demand for these materials is increasing year by year. This is a sharp contradiction." If this contradiction is not resolved, "our socialist industrialization will encounter great difficulties, and we will not be able to complete socialist industrialization." ("On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation") It can be seen from this how important agriculture is to guaranteeing the development of industry.

Moreover, agriculture is one of the important sources of capital accumulation required for socialist industrialization. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago: "Peasants - this is the main body of China's industrial market. Only they can supply the most abundant grain and raw materials, and absorb the largest amount of industrial products." ("On the Coalition Government") There are more than 500 million farmers in China, and their purchasing power is not high now (of course, it has increased compared with before liberation), but with the rapid development of agricultural cooperation and the increase in agricultural production, the purchasing power of farmers will increase day by day. This is a vast domestic market. The quantity of light industrial products and means of production they need is astonishing. If we can exchange a large number of industrial products for farmers' agricultural products, it will not only meet the farmers' material needs, but also accumulate a large amount of capital for the country's industrialization.

It can be seen from this that we concentrate our efforts on developing industry, but we must never reduce the significance of agricultural development. Only with the corresponding development of agriculture and the support of the vast number of farmers can our industrialization be realized. We must prevent and overcome the phenomenon of separation between agriculture and industry, so that the two are closely combined, with the development of industry driving the development of agriculture, and the development of agriculture promoting the development of industry. Comrade Mao Zedong said very correctly: "We must not divide and isolate the two things of industry and agriculture, socialist industrialization and socialist agricultural transformation, and we must not only emphasize one aspect and weaken the other." ("On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation") What has happened since the establishment of the new China is this: first, the agricultural economy was restored and developed, creating conditions for the recovery and development of industry; then the development of industry drove the development of agriculture; after the winter of 1955, the upsurge of agricultural cooperation turned around and promoted the development of industry, causing us to consider increasing the speed of industry.

It can be seen from this that our first five-year plan emphasized the significance of developing agriculture while determining the policy of socialist industrialization, and pointed out that developing agriculture is the basic condition for guaranteeing the development of industry and the completion of the entire economic plan. This is correct. The construction practice in recent years has proved this point. Although in the process of construction, for a short period of time, we did not grasp the promotion of agricultural development tightly enough, and there were some delays in the issue of agricultural cooperation, but this was quickly corrected. Under the call of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, we opposed the right-leaning conservative thinking, implemented the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which led to an upsurge of cooperation, correctly solved the problem of agricultural cooperation, and then there was an upsurge of agricultural production. The CPC Central Committee, in the situation of the upsurge of cooperation and the upsurge of agricultural production, put forward the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967", which further promoted the development of agricultural production.

It can be seen from this that our proposal for the second five-year plan requires that agriculture be raised to a higher level in the direction pointed out by the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967. Grain, cash crops and agricultural and sideline products need to be actively developed to meet the needs of the entire national economy. This is a correct and should be adopted. Now, we must give full play to the superior conditions that agriculture has basically realized cooperation, rely on the collective strength of cooperatives and the support of the government, and take various active measures to promote the increase in agricultural production.

III.

In the national economic plan, it is necessary to maintain the correct proportion between heavy industry and light industry. This is also an extremely important issue.

According to the theory of reproduction in Marxist-Leninist economics, the entire social production is divided into two major categories, namely, the production of the means of production (Category I) and the production of consumer goods (Category II). In order to ensure the expanded reproduction of various departments of the national economy, in order to ensure the continuous progress of technology, the continued development of productive forces, and the continuous improvement of labor productivity, it is necessary to give priority to the growth of Category I, that is, the means of production. This is an objective economic law. Lenin wrote in "Review of Economic Romanticism": "In order to expand production ('accumulation' in the absolute sense), it is necessary to first produce the means of production, and to do this, it is necessary to expand the social production sector that manufactures the means of production." Therefore, in order to adapt to this economic law, it is necessary to give priority to the development of heavy industry, especially the machinery manufacturing industry and the metallurgical industry, in order to create a strong socialist material production base, technically equip and continuously develop agriculture, light industry and other industrial sectors that produce consumer goods, so as to ensure the country's economic independence and national defense forces. Therefore, the development speed of heavy industry should exceed the development speed of the production sector of people's consumer goods. This is a truth proved by the entire historical experience of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Especially in old China, the output value of the means of production industry only accounted for 23% of the total industrial output value in 1936, and only 26.6% in 1949. Heavy industry was very poor and weak. In order to change this situation, it is even more necessary to ensure the priority development of heavy industry. Because of this, our Party's general line emphasizes that the central link in realizing socialist industrialization is to develop the country's heavy industry; the construction of heavy industry occupies the most important position in the industrial construction of our first five-year plan; our second five-year plan is still to continue economic construction centered on heavy industry in order to establish a solid foundation for China's socialist industrialization.

However, giving priority to the development of heavy industry must not ignore light industry, and light industry must be developed accordingly while developing heavy industry.

Only by developing light industry can we meet the needs of the people's lives. With the development of the socialist economy, on the basis of production growth, the people's purchasing power is increasing day by day, and the demand for consumer goods is constantly increasing. Only by meeting this constantly growing need can we stimulate and promote the further development of production. Therefore, this requires the development of light industry. For example, in 1956 alone, the number of new workers added to various departments of the national economy reached 840,000; the average wage of employees nationwide increased by 14.5%. Due to the increase in wages, the income increase of employees nationwide will reach more than 1.25 billion yuan. According to the proposal of the second five-year plan, the number of employees will increase by about 6 million to 7 million in five years; the average wage of workers and staff will increase by 25% to 30%. The number of workers is constantly increasing, and wages are constantly increasing, and naturally the demand for consumer goods is constantly increasing. Due to the agricultural cooperation and the development of agricultural production, the income and purchasing power of farmers are increasing day by day, and their demand for light industrial products is also increasing day by day. According to the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), by 1967, the national total output of grain will increase by more than one and a half times compared with the output in 1955, and the national total output of cotton will increase by two times compared with the output in 1955. During the second five-year plan period, the total income of farmers may increase by 25% to 30%. If we do not have a large number of industrial products (especially light industrial products) to exchange for their agricultural products to meet the farmers' requirements, and there is a shortage of commodity supply, it will not only affect the stability of the market and prices, but also affect the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. However, the stability of prices and the market is a very necessary condition for ensuring the smooth progress of socialist construction - mainly heavy industry construction; consolidating the worker-peasant alliance is of decisive significance for the cause of the Party and the state. Therefore, in order to gradually improve the people's material and cultural living standards on the basis of production development, we must develop light industry accordingly. This meets the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism, otherwise it will hinder the growth of the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in building socialism.

Developing light industry is not only to meet the needs of the people's lives, but also to accumulate a large amount of capital for the country's industrialization. Everyone knows that the characteristics of light industry are less investment, shorter construction time, faster capital turnover, and more profit. If the funds accumulated by light industry and textile industry enterprises for the state from 1953 to 1955 are used, then more than a dozen steel plants with an annual output of 500,000 tons of steel can be built. During this period, the state's investment in light industry's capital construction funds plus working capital was less than a quarter of the above figure. And the basic construction of light industry enterprises can generally recover all the funds within one year. Because light industry has a fast turnover, usually a spinning mill, a sugar mill or another light industry factory can earn back several times, at least half to one times the money within one year, which is much faster than heavy industry in accumulating funds. Therefore, if we really like to develop heavy industry, we must develop light industry and agriculture, so that we can have a large amount of funds to meet the needs of developing heavy industry.

Moreover, the development of heavy industry requires the cooperation of light industry in production. For example, if we want to build an automobile factory, we need many light industry factories to supply it with products, such as rubber, cork, cowhide, phenolic plastics, etc., manufactured by light industry, which are all indispensable. For example, to manufacture machines, we need belts; to manufacture cement, we need paper bags to hold cement, which requires some light industry to cooperate with.

It can be seen from this that while giving priority to the construction policy of developing heavy industry, in order to meet the needs of the people and the country, we must attach importance to the development of light industry. Although the growth of heavy industry should be faster and the proportion should be larger, the growth of light industry should be slower and the proportion should be smaller, but the difference between light and heavy industry should not be too large, the distance should not be too far, and the phenomenon of disconnection should be formed, so that the production of consumer goods cannot meet the growth of social purchasing power, and the accumulation of funds cannot meet the requirements of the expansion of the national scale. The view that the development of light industry and the development of heavy industry are opposed is one-sided and wrong. If, under the conditions allowed by funds, raw materials, and the market, and under the guidance of the state, accelerate the development of light industry according to a certain proportion, instead of blindly and one-sidedly developing it, it is precisely conducive to the development of heavy industry, and it is precisely for the purpose of developing heavy industry more and faster.

It can be seen from this that the investment ratio of light and heavy industry stipulated in our first five-year plan is generally appropriate. The first five-year plan stipulates that in industrial investment, the investment in heavy industry accounts for 88.8%, and the investment in light industry accounts for 11.2%, that is, the ratio between the two is eight to one. The determination of this ratio is based on the principle of giving priority to the production of the means of production on the one hand, and on the other hand, it is based on the actual situation in China at that time. The actual situation in China at that time was: the foundation of China's heavy industry was particularly weak, and light industry occupied a dominant position (heavy industry only accounted for 40% of industry in 1952); during the years from 1952 to 1955, the basic situation of light industry production was that there was insufficient raw materials but surplus equipment; in addition, my country has a vast handicraft industry, which can make up for the shortcomings of modern industry. Therefore, according to this situation, the ratio is naturally larger for heavy industry and smaller for light industry; but later in the process of implementation, the state increased some investment in light industry, increasing the original 65 light industry construction units to 99, so that the investment ratio of heavy industry and light industry may be changed to seven to one as a result of the implementation of the five-year plan. According to the proposal of the second five-year plan, during the second five-year plan period, considering that the people's consumption level will gradually increase, the production capacity of some light industrial products will feel insufficient, so it is decided to appropriately increase the proportion of light industrial investment. This should be said to be necessary and correct.

IV.

The issue of the relationship between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry seems to be an old issue, and there is no need to talk about it more; but in fact, not everyone understands it very clearly. In the past few years, many wrong views have occurred on these issues. When our Party put forward the policy of socialist industrialization, some people doubted the industry's leadership of agriculture. They felt that more than 80% of China's population are farmers, and agriculture is fundamental. How can we say that industry leads agriculture? Everyone knows that the issue of agricultural cooperation once caused a great debate. At that time, some comrades with right-leaning conservative thinking believed that socialist industrialization could move forward in isolation from agricultural cooperation, industry could move forward in isolation from agriculture, and therefore adopted a particularly slow speed for agricultural cooperation, even with "resolute contraction" and "massive dissolution" of many agricultural cooperatives, to tie up the development of agriculture, so that the pace of agricultural development and the pace of industrial development are not adapted. On the issue of the relationship between heavy industry and light industry, there is a view of "inversion of light and heavy", thinking that "developing heavy industry will affect people's lives", "developing heavy industry will undermine the worker-peasant alliance", "today our international environment is different from that of the Soviet Union at that time, and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, there is no need to rush to develop heavy industry". These are all neglecting heavy industry, attempting to reduce the speed of heavy industry and advocating first developing light industry or making the various sectors of the national economy "advance side by side". However, there is also a view of "heavy heavy light", that is, believing that heavy industry is important and light industry is not important, and therefore one-sidedly emphasizes the significance of developing heavy industry, attempting to reduce the development speed of light industry as much as possible, so that heavy and light industry are disconnected. Our Party has waged a serious struggle against these erroneous views, adhered to the correct policy, and ensured the smooth progress of socialist construction; even those who held erroneous views have mostly realized their mistakes and turned to support the Party's policy after criticism. However, it can be proved from this that truly clarifying this relationship, this contradiction, existing between industry and agriculture and between light and heavy industry, and solving this relationship and overcoming this contradiction well, is of great significance for mobilizing all available forces and positive factors to serve socialism.

Then, why do some people have these erroneous views? In addition to those who have ulterior motives, generally speaking, they are mostly due to insufficient experience and cognitive errors. They are either unclear about the relationship between industry and agriculture and between light and heavy industry, or their understanding is insufficient, or they neglect the experience of the Soviet Union or have an incorrect understanding of the experience of the Soviet Union; they either do not study objective economic laws enough, or they do not pay enough attention to investigating and studying the actual situation and development trends of our country, so they often produce subjective and one-sided errors. "The so-called subjectivity is not knowing how to look at problems objectively, that is, not knowing how to look at problems from a materialist point of view." "The so-called one-sidedness is not knowing how to look at problems comprehensively." ("On Contradiction") They often look at problems in isolation rather than in connection with each other. They do not understand the internal contradictions of objective things and the characteristics of the various aspects of the contradictions. Sometimes they only see one side and not the other, only see the part and not the whole. Therefore, they cannot find the correct method to solve the contradiction. When they pay attention to industry, they neglect agriculture; when they emphasize heavy industry, they neglect light industry, or vice versa. Therefore, they cannot find the correct method to solve the contradiction between industry and agriculture and between light and heavy industry. Of course, there are many objective reasons for the occurrence of these errors. From this we can realize how important it is for a Party cadre and a state worker to seriously study dialectical materialism and political economy in order to do their job well and better serve socialism. Only by seriously studying Marxist-Leninist science, correcting our way of thinking, mastering the laws of economic development, and strengthening investigation and research, being good at summarizing experience, and constantly making specific analysis of specific problems, can we find the correct method to solve problems and overcome the errors of subjectivism (including dogmatism and empiricism) and bureaucracy. Everyone should draw experience from the debate and resolution of this issue, so that the future construction work can progress smoothly. Especially when we are drafting the second five-year plan, we must put the planned indicators of industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, etc. on a basis that is both active and prudent and reliable, and we must oppose the bias of right-leaning conservative thinking; we must also oppose the bias of being impatient and rash. In this regard, Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his political report to the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "The speed of development must be active, so as not to lose the opportunity and fall into the error of conservatism; it must also be prudent and reliable, so as not to deviate from the correct proportion of economic development, making the people's burden too heavy, or making different departments disconnected from each other, so that the plan cannot be completed, causing waste, which is the error of adventurism."

    论工农业之间和轻重工业之间的关系
    ——学习党的第八次全国代表大会文件的笔记之一
    沙英
    一
    当我们进行社会主义建设的时候，由于工人阶级领导着国家政权，经济命脉都掌握在国家手中，在社会主义经济领导之下，国民经济得到迅速的恢复和发展，特别是党确定了在过渡时期的总路线，这就使得我们有可能根据建设社会主义的目标，用计划来领导国民经济。随着社会主义革命的胜利进展，生产资料的公有制日益扩大和巩固，按照一定的计划进行生产就显得更加必要。因为国民经济是由许多部门的无数企业组成的一个统一的有机的整体，如果没有一个正确的统一的总计划来领导，各自为政，盲目发展，没有统一的目标和相互的配合，要进行社会主义大生产，那简直是不可想像的。用列宁的话说：社会主义革命的巨大任务，就是要把全部国家经济机构变成一架大机器，变成一个使几万万人都遵照一个计划工作的经济机体。当然，对国民经济进行集中的计划领导，并不是否认各个部门、各个企业有必要的独立性和主动性。
    对国民经济进行计划领导，要有科学的预见。为了不犯错误和少犯错误，我们一定要把自己的经济计划建立在对于客观经济规律的认识、对于国内外条件的正确估计的基础上。这首先要求我们掌握并善于利用国民经济有计划（按比例）发展的规律。因为这个规律在社会主义经济中，是适合社会主义的基本经济规律的要求的生产调节者。只有遵照这个规律，根据我国的具体情况和发展趋势，使各个部门相互联系，协调一致，有计划地按比例地发展，才能避免混乱和浪费，最有效地利用我们的人力、物力和财力，顺利地进行生产和建设，从而得到良好的结果。
    我们指导国民经济发展的第一个五年计划就是这样制定的。现在这个计划已经执行三年多了，从我们已获得的巨大成就来看，由于全国人民辛勤的努力，这个计划所规定的任务，将要被提前完成和超额完成。这就是说，实践已经证明这个计划大体上是正确的，是基本上符合客观的经济规律和我国的实际情况的，也是符合党的总路线的要求的，所以它才能指导国民经济的发展获得这样大的成就。当然，由于我们的经验不足，对国民经济有计划发展的规律的认识不够，对经济情况还缺乏全面、深刻的了解，再加客观上许多困难的存在，这个计划还不是完美的，还是有不少缺点和错误的。不过这些缺点和错误有的已经纠正，有的还需要今后注意克服。
    现在党中央又提出了第二个五年计划的建议，在这个建议中，对第二个五年计划的基本任务，主要轮廓和若干主要问题都作了明确的规定和说明。根据这个建议所规定的具体方针和各种指标看来，第二个五年计划的实现，我国的国民经济将有巨大而迅速的发展，为在第三个五年计划期间基本上实现过渡时期的总路线准备好必要的条件。现在党和全国人民当前的中心任务，是争取超额完成第一个五年计划和积极准备第二个五年计划。为了完成这个中心任务，根据我们已有的经济建设的经验，并参照苏联和各人民民主国家的经验，今后我们一定要注意解决关于工农业之间和轻重工业之间的关系问题。因为这是我们对国民经济进行计划领导的最重要的问题，如果对它们之间的关系安排不当，发生比例失调的现象，就会使我们的社会主义经济建设发生严重的后果。所以刘少奇同志在向八大的政治报告中和周恩来同志关于第二个五年计划建议的报告中都提出并阐明了这个问题，值得我们注意和研究。
    二
    工业和农业是国民经济中两个最重要的部门，规定工业和农业间的正确比例具有头等的意义。如果工业和农业间的比例规定得不恰当，使两个部门不协调，这不只是一个简单的技术性的问题，也不仅只影响国民经济的发展，而且会影响到工农联盟的关系。所以说工业与农业的关系是建成社会主义经济的根本问题，是巩固工农联盟的中心问题。
    在研究工农业之间的关系时，首先我们应当指出：虽然工农业的发展是互相依赖、互相促进、互相影响和互相制约的，但是工业是领导农业的，城市是领导农村的，工业的发展是整个国民经济发展的基础。譬如说，我们只有发展工业，为农业生产充足的机器、燃料、电力和肥料时，才能使技术落后的农业，转变成为建立在进步技术基础上的现代的大农业。我们建设社会主义，最重要的问题，是要建设社会主义的物质基础，即大工业。在大工业中占决定地位的是生产生产资料的部门，即重工业。只有发展大工业特别是重工业，才能保证在先进技术的基础上改造整个国民经济，保证经济的独立、国防的巩固和社会主义的胜利。特别是我国原是一个经济很落后的国家，在解放前我国的现代工业在国民经济中只占很少的比重（在1949年，使用机器的工业的产值约占工农业生产总值的17％左右），而且主要是一些轻工业。在这种国民经济十分落后的情况之下，我们就更加需要发展工业，特别是重工业。只有发展工业、实行社会主义工业化，建成一个基本上完整的工业体系，使工业生产在社会生产中占主要地位，使重工业生产在整个工业生产中占显著的优势，才能克服我国在先进的社会制度同落后的社会生产力之间的矛盾，才能把贫弱的农业国变为富强的工业国。正因为如此，我们党在过渡时期的总路线才以逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化为主体；我们第一个五年计划也以建立社会主义工业化的初步基础作为发展的重点；我们第二个五年计划也把工业建设当作首要的任务，以便建立起社会主义工业化的巩固基础。这是完全正确的。
    大力发展工业，并不是说可以忽视农业。我们一定要对农业的发展应有足够的重视。农业对于保证满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要起着重要的作用。农业包括粮食、技术作物和动物饲养业等，它们在国民经济中都占着很重要的地位。农业的第一个目的是生产粮食。只有粮食的增产，才能保证人民对于食物的需要。我国是一个拥有六万万人口的大国，如果没有粮食的增产，那是很难满足和提高人民的生活水平的。我国1952年粮食产量为三千二百多亿斤原粮（包括薯类），如按全国人口平均计算，则每人每年仅得原粮五百多斤。这是一个很低的水平。现在城市和工矿区的人口约有八千万，随着工业化的发展，城市和工矿区的人口必定迅速增加，对粮食和副食品的需要自然也不断增长。再加上为了防御自然灾害和种种意外事件，我们还要储存足够数量的粮食。
    我们日益发展的工业特别是轻工业需要由农业供给原料。例如棉、麻、甘蔗、大豆、花生等等，都是工业的重要原料。可以说轻工业的原料大约有90％以上是依靠农业供给的。因此，农业收成的好坏，直接影响轻工业以至整个工业增长的速度。1953年工业增长的速度是最快的一年，工业总产值比1952年增加了31.7％，这主要的原因是1952年的农业丰收。1955年是工业增长速度最慢的一年，工业总产值较上年只增加了8％，其主要原因是1953和1954这两年的农业因灾害而没有全部完成计划。毛泽东同志曾指出：“我国的商品粮食和工业原料的生产水平，现在是很低的，而国家对于这些物资的需要却是一年一年地增大，这是一个尖锐的矛盾。”如果不解决这个矛盾，“我们的社会主义工业化事业就会遇到绝大的困难，我们就不可能完成社会主义工业化。”（“关于农业合作化问题”）由此可见，农业保证工业的发展是如何的重要了。
    而且，农业是社会主义工业化所需的资金积累的重要来源之一。毛泽东同志早就指出：“农民——这是中国工业市场的主体。只有他们能够供给最丰富的粮食和原料，并吸收最大量的工业品。”（“论联合政府”）我国农民在五万万以上，他们的购买力虽然现在还不高（当然比解放前是提高了一些），但是随着农业合作化的迅速发展和农业生产的提高，农民的购买力将日益提高。这是一个广大的国内市场。他们所需要的轻工业品和生产资料，其数量之大都是惊人的。如果我们能以大量的工业品去交换农民的农产品，那是既满足了农民的物资需要，又为国家工业化积累了大量的资金。
    由此可见，我们集中力量发展工业，但绝不能减轻农业发展的意义。只有农业的相应发展，只有广大农民的支持，我们的工业化事业才能实现。我们要防止和克服农业同工业脱节的现象，使两者密切结合起来，以工业的发展带动农业的发展，以农业的发展推动工业的发展。毛泽东同志说得非常对：“我们对于工业和农业、社会主义的工业化和社会主义的农业改造这样两件事，决不可以分割起来和互相孤立起来去看，决不可以只强调一方面，减弱另一方面。”（“关于农业合作化问题”）自新中国建立以来所发生的事情就是这样：首先使农业经济恢复和发展，造成工业恢复和发展的条件；随后是工业的发展带动了农业的发展；到1955年冬以后，农业合作化的高潮反转过来又推动工业的发展，使我们考虑增加工业的速度。
    由此可见，我国的第一个五年计划在确定社会主义工业化方针的同时，强调了发展农业的意义，指出发展农业是保证工业发展和全部经济计划完成的基本条件，这是正确的。几年来的建设实践已经证明了这一点。虽然在建设的过程中曾在一个短时期内，我们对推动农业的发展方面抓得不紧，在农业合作化问题上有些耽搁，但这很快就被纠正了。在党中央和毛泽东同志的号召之下，反对了右倾保守思想，执行了中央七届六中全会“关于农业合作化问题的决议”，从而出现了一个合作化的高潮，正确地解决了农业合作化问题，并紧接着出现了农业生产的高潮。中共中央又在合作化高潮和农业生产高潮的形势下提出了“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要”（草案），更加推动了农业生产的发展。
    由此可见，我们第二个五年计划的建议，要求按照1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）所指出的方向，把农业提到更高的水平，不论粮食、经济作物和农副业产品都需要积极发展，以适应整个国民经济的需要，是正确的、应当被采纳的建议。现在，我们就要充分发挥农业已经基本上实现合作化这个优越条件，依靠合作社的集体力量和政府的支援，采取各种积极的措施，来促进农业的增产。
    三
    在国民经济计划中，重工业和轻工业之间，要保持正确的比例。这也是一个极为重要的问题。
    根据马克思列宁主义经济学关于再生产的理论，社会的全部生产分作两大部类，即生产资料的生产（第一部类）和消费资料的生产（第二部类）。为了保证国民经济各部门的扩大再生产，为了保证技术的不断进步、生产力的继续发展和劳动生产率的不断提高，就必须使第一部类即生产资料的增长占优先地位。这是一条客观的经济规律。列宁在“评经济浪漫主义”一文中曾写道：“为了扩大生产（绝对意义上的‘积累’），必须首先生产生产资料，而要做到这一点，就必须扩大制造生产资料的社会生产部门。”因此，为了适应这种经济规律，就要优先发展重工业，特别是机器制造业和冶金工业，以便创立强大的社会主义的物质生产基础，从技术上装备并不断发展农业、轻工业和生产消费品的其他工业部门，从而保证国家的经济独立和国防力量。因此，重工业的发展速度就要超过人民消费品生产部门的发展速度。这是苏联及其他社会主义国家发展的全部历史经验所证明了的道理。特别是在旧中国，生产资料工业的产值在1936年只占全部工业产值的23％，到1949年也只占26.6％，重工业非常贫弱。为了改变这种情况，更要保证重工业的优先发展。正因为如此，我们党的总路线强调了实现社会主义工业化的中心环节是发展国家的重工业；我们第一个五年计划的工业建设中重工业的建设占最重要的地位；我们第二个五年计划仍然是继续进行以重工业为中心的经济建设，以便建立我国社会主义工业化的巩固基础。
    但是，优先发展重工业，绝不能忽视轻工业，必须在发展重工业的同时，相应地发展轻工业。
    只有发展轻工业才可以满足人民生活的需要。随着社会主义经济的发展，在生产增长的基础上，人民的购买力日益提高，对生活消费品的需要不断增加，只有满足了这种经常增长的需要，才能对生产的进一步发展起着刺激和推动的作用。因此，这就需要轻工业的发展。例如在1956年一年内，国民经济各部门增加的新工人就达八十四万人；全国职工的平均工资提高14.5％。由于工资提高，全国职工增加的收入将达十二点五亿余元。根据第二个五年计划的建议，五年内要增加职工六百万人到七百万人左右；工人和职员的平均工资将增加25％到30％。工人不断增加，工资不断提高，自然对于生活消费品的需要不断增加。由于农业合作化和农业生产的发展，农民的收入和购买力日益提高，他们对轻工业品的需要也日益增加。根据全国农业发展纲要（草案），到1967年，粮食的全国总产量将比1955年的产量增加一倍半以上，棉花的全国总产量比1955年的产量增加两倍。在第二个五年计划期内，农民的全部收入可能增长25％到30％，如果我们没有大量的工业品（特别是轻工业品）来交换他们的农产品，以满足农民的要求，从而出现商品供应缺乏的情况，那就不仅要影响市场和物价的稳定，而且要影响工农联盟的巩固。可是物价和市场的稳定，却是保证社会主义建设——主要是重工业建设顺利前进的十分必要的条件；巩固工农联盟却又是对党和国家的事业具有决定的意义。因此，为了在生产发展的基础上逐步提高人民的物质和文化生活水平，我们就要相应地发展轻工业，这是符合社会主义的基本经济规律的要求的，否则就会妨碍人民群众建设社会主义的积极性和创造性的增长。
    发展轻工业不仅是为了满足人民生活的需要，而且可以为国家工业化积累大量的资金。大家都知道，轻工业的特点，是投资较少、建设时间较短、资金周转较快、赢利较多。如果把1953到1955这三年间轻工业和纺织工业的企业为国家积累的资金加以使用的话，那就可以建设十几个年产五十万吨钢的钢铁厂。而在这个时期，国家投资于轻工业的基本建设经费加上流动资金，还不到上述数字的四分之一。并且轻工业企业的基本建设一般都在一年以内就能全部收回资金。因为轻工业周转快，通常一个纱厂、一个糖厂或其他一个轻工业工厂，在一年之内就可以赚回几倍至少可赚回一半到一倍的钱，比重工业积累资金快得多。因此，如果我们真正喜欢发展重工业，那就必须发展轻工业和农业，这样才能有大量资金来满足发展重工业的需要。
    而且，发展重工业是需要轻工业在生产上加以配合的，例如我们要建设一个汽车厂，就需要许多轻工业工厂为它供应产品，像轻工业制造的橡胶类、软木类、牛皮类、胶木类等等，都是必不可少的。再如制造机器，就需要皮带；制造水泥，就需要装水泥的纸袋，这都要有一些轻工业与之配合的。
    由此可见，在优先发展重工业的建设方针的同时，为了满足人民和国家的需要，必须重视轻工业的发展。虽然重工业的增长要快些，比重要大些，轻工业的增长要慢些，比重要小些，但轻重工业之间不能相差过大，距离过远，形成脱节的现象，使消费品的生产不能适应社会购买力的增长，使资金积累不能适应国家规模扩大的要求。那种把轻工业的发展和重工业的发展相对立的观点是片面的、错误的。如果在资金、原料、市场所允许的情况下，并且在国家指导之下，按照一定的比例，加速发展轻工业，而不是盲目的片面的发展，那正是有助于重工业的发展，正是为了更多、更快地发展重工业。
    由此可见，我们第一个五年计划规定的轻重工业的投资比例大体上是适当的。第一个五年计划规定：在工业投资中重工业方面的投资占88.8％，轻工业方面的投资占11.2％，即两者之间的比例为八比一。这种比例的确定，一方面是从生产资料生产优先增长的原理出发，一方面是从当时中国的实际情况出发。当时中国的实际情况是：中国重工业的基础特别薄弱，轻工业占优势地位（1952年重工业在工业中只占40％）；1952至1955这几年内，轻工业生产的基本情况是原料不足而设备有余；加以我国还有广大的手工业，可以补足现代工业的不足。因此，根据这种情况确定的比例，自然是重工业的比重较大，轻工业的比重较小；但是后来在执行的过程中，国家曾经增加了一些轻工业的投资，将原来的六十五个轻工业建设单位增加到九十九个，使五年计划执行的结果，重工业和轻工业的投资比例有可能改变为七比一。根据第二个五年计划的建议，在第二个五年计划期间，由于考虑到人民消费水平逐步提高，若干轻工业品的生产能力将感不足，所以决定适当地提高轻工业投资所占的比重。这应当说是必要的和正确的。
    四
    关于工业和农业、重工业和轻工业的关系问题，好像是老问题，不需多谈了；但是实际上并不是所有的人都理解得很清楚的。几年来在这些问题上曾发生过许多错误的观点。当我们党提出社会主义工业化的政策的时候，便有人对工业领导农业抱有怀疑，他们觉得：中国农民占人口80％以上，农业是根本，怎么能说工业领导农业呢？大家都知道，关于农业合作化的问题曾引起了一场大辩论，当时有些抱右倾保守思想的同志，认为社会主义工业化可以离开农业合作化、工业可以离开农业而孤立地前进，因而对农业合作化采取特别迟缓的速度，甚至以“坚决收缩”和“大批解散”许多农业合作社，来束缚农业的发展，使农业发展的步骤和工业发展的步骤不相适应。在重工业和轻工业的关系问题上，有一种“轻重倒置”的观点，认为“发展重工业就会影响人民生活”、“发展重工业就会破坏工农联盟”、“今天我们所处的国际环境与苏联当时不同，而且有苏联的援助，所以不要忙于发展重工业”，这都是忽视重工业、企图降低重工业的速度而主张先发展轻工业或使国民经济各部门“齐头并进”的论调。但是也有一种“重重轻轻”的观点，即认为重工业重要而轻工业不重要，因而片面地强调发展重工业的意义，企图尽量减低轻工业的发展速度，使轻重工业脱节。我们党曾对这些错误观点作了严肃的斗争，坚持了正确的方针，保证了社会主义建设的顺利进展；就是那些持有错误观点的人，经过批判之后，也大都认识了自己的错误，转而拥护党的方针。不过，从此可以证明，真正搞清楚工农业之间和轻重工业之间存在着的这种关系、这种矛盾，并很好地解决这种关系、克服这种矛盾而前进，对于调动一切可用的力量和积极因素为社会主义服务，具有极重要的意义。
    那末，为什么有些人会产生这些错误的观点呢？除了那些别有用心的人以外，一般地说，大都是因为经验不足和认识上的错误。他们不是对工农业之间和轻重工业之间的关系不清楚或认识不足，就是忽视苏联的经验或者对苏联的经验作不正确的了解；他们不是对客观的经济规律学习不够，就是对调查研究我国的实际情况和发展趋势注意不够，所以便常常产生主观性、片面性的错误。“所谓主观性，就是不知道客观地看问题，也就是不知道用唯物的观点去看问题。”“所谓片面性，就是不知道全面地看问题。”（“矛盾论”）他们往往孤立地而不是互相联系地看问题，他们不了解客观事物的内部矛盾及矛盾各方面的特点，有时只看见一方而看不见另一方，只看见局部而看不见全体。因此，他们找不出解决矛盾的正确方法。当他们注意工业时便忽视了农业，当他们强调重工业时便忽视了轻工业，或者是相反的情况。因此，他们找不到解决工农业之间和轻重工业之间的矛盾的正确方法。当然，他们这种错误的发生也是有许多客观原因的。从此我们可以体会到，为了做好自己的工作，更好地为社会主义服务，一个党的干部和国家的工作人员，认真研究辩证唯物主义，认真学习政治经济学的知识，是如何的重要了。只有认真学习马克思列宁主义的科学，端正我们的思想方法，掌握经济发展的规律，并加强调查研究，善于总结经验，经常对具体问题作具体分析，才能找到解决问题的正确方法，克服主观主义（包括教条主义和经验主义）和官僚主义的错误。大家都应当从这个问题的争论和解决中吸取经验，使今后的建设工作顺利进展。特别是当我们在编制第二个五年计划草案的时候，必须把工业和农业、重工业和轻工业等等计划指标放在既积极而又稳妥可靠的基础上，既要反对右倾保守思想的偏向；又要反对急躁冒进的偏向。对此，刘少奇同志在向党的第八次全国代表大会的政治报告中指出：“发展速度必须是积极的，以免丧失时机，陷入保守主义的错误；又必须是稳妥可靠的，以免脱离经济发展的正确比例，使人民的负担过重，或者使不同的部门互相脱节，使计划不能完成，造成浪费，那就是冒险主义的错误。”
