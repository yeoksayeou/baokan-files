Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd: Damascus Dispatch: Syrian Prime Minister Sabri al-Asali said in a radio address to the Syrian nation yesterday that Syria is "determined to stand with Egypt to the end and share its destiny."

Asali reiterated Syria's decision to fulfill its obligations to Egypt and is placing Syrian troops at the disposal of the Syrian-Egyptian Joint Command under the leadership of Egyptian Army Commander-in-Chief General Abdel Hakim Amer.

In his broadcast, Asali condemned the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt, considering it "the most serious harm to international morality and international relations." He said, "This aggression puts the world's conscience to a severe test. If the test fails, the United Nations will have no meaning."

Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd: Amman Dispatch: Jordanian King Hussein said in a radio address to the nation today that the war in Egypt is not just the war of one country, Egypt, but of all Arab countries. Jordan must be prepared to make sacrifices.

Hussein said that the Arab countries have never been in such a critical situation as they are today.

He continued: "They are facing a period of testing today, requiring patience and a firm belief in their right to fight for freedom and sovereignty. We can even say that the war currently being waged on the beloved land of Egypt will determine our long-term future."

Hussein also said that during this period, our country will bravely face the attack on Egypt by Israel, an enemy of peace, supported by the two great powers of Britain and France.

It is reported that King Hussein has assured Egyptian President Nasser that Jordan, with its well-equipped army, is ready for any sudden eventuality.

The Jordanian people were shocked and indignant at the news of the British and French aggression against Egypt.

When the news spread in the Jordanian sector of Jerusalem, groups of young people stopped working and immediately went to army headquarters to apply to join the volunteer army.

Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd: TASS Beirut, November 1st: According to newspaper reports, Lebanese President Chamoun has telegraphed the heads of Arab states, suggesting that an emergency summit of Arab states be convened immediately to discuss the current situation and take the necessary measures to deal with Israel and the Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt.

    据新华社2日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理萨布里·阿萨利昨天向叙利亚全国发表广播说，叙利亚“决心同埃及并肩走到底并且同埃及共命运”。
    阿萨利重申叙利亚决定履行它对埃及的义务，并正在把叙利亚的军队交由叙埃联合陆军司令部调遣而置于埃及陆军总司令阿卜杜勒·哈基姆·阿密尔将军的领导之下。
    阿萨利在广播中谴责英法对埃及的侵略，认为这是“对国际道义和国际关系最严重的伤害”。他说，“这次侵略使世界良心受到严重的考验。要是考验失败，联合国的存在就没有一点意义。”
    新华社2日讯　安曼消息：约旦国王侯赛尼今天在对全国发表的广播演说中说，在埃及的战争，不仅仅是埃及一个国家的战争，而且是所有阿拉伯国家的战争。约旦必须准备付出牺牲。
    侯赛尼说，阿拉伯国家从来没有处在像今天这样的危急局势中。
    他继续说：“他们今天面临着一段考验时期，需要耐心并且坚信他们争取自由和主权的权利。我们甚至可以这样说，目前正在可爱的埃及土地上进行的战争将要决定我们长远的未来。”
    侯赛尼还说，在这个时期，我们的国家将要勇敢地正视受到英法两个大国支持的、和平的敌人以色列对埃及的进攻。
    据报道，侯赛尼国王已经向埃及总统纳赛尔保证：约旦以它的装备很好的军队随时应付任何突然事变。
    约旦人民对于英国和法国侵略埃及的消息感到震惊和愤慨。
    当消息在耶路撒冷约旦区传开以后，成群结队的青年人停止了工作，并且立即到陆军总部要求加入志愿军。
    新华社2日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特1日讯：据报纸消息，黎巴嫩总统夏蒙已经拍电报给阿拉伯各国首脑，建议立刻召开阿拉伯国家首脑紧急会议，讨论目前发生的情况，并且采取必要的措施，来对付以色列以及英法对埃及的武装进攻。
    新华社2日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩总理阿卜杜拉·雅非11月1日说，到现在为止，约旦、伊拉克、叙利亚和利比亚已经接受了黎巴嫩总统夏蒙提出的召开阿拉伯国家首脑紧急会议来考虑中东局势的建议。
    伊拉克国王费萨尔提议贝鲁特作为会议地点。
