Comrades: World peace and civilization are now under serious threat and have suffered localized destruction. This is because the heroic Republic of Egypt, the link between the two continents of Asia and Africa, has been subjected to aggressive attacks by the Anglo-French colonial imperialists and their partner Israel using naval, land, and air forces. Peaceful and innocent people in Egypt and beautiful cities have suffered cruel massacres and bombings. Egyptian national territory has been occupied by the enemy, and the aggression is continuing to expand. The Anglo-French colonial imperialist aggressors, in order to seize the Suez Canal, plunder oil resources in the Middle East, expand colonial territories, and oppress weak national states, have brazenly disregarded the opposition, protests, condemnation, and appeals of people all over the world (including the British and French people), disregarded the destruction of the United Nations Charter, international law, and international treaties, and disregarded the advice and warnings of all peace-loving and justice-advocating countries. They have adopted a barbaric and insane policy of aggressive war that violates justice, violates humanity, destroys peace, and destroys civilization. This heinous crime is absolutely intolerable to all peace-loving, civilized, democratic, free, independent, and equal people. This robber behavior of murder, arson, rampant tyranny, plunder, and robbery will inevitably meet with a thorough and tragic defeat under the joint counterattack of the heroic Egyptian people and the people of the world. Today, the heroic Egyptian people, for the sake of human dignity, for the sake of human justice, for the sake of world peace, for the sake of national territorial integrity, national sovereignty, national independence, and for the survival and happiness of their descendants, have united like steel under the leadership of their wise leaders and are carrying out a nationwide war of resistance against aggression. Today, the great national war of resistance being waged by the heroic Egyptian people is also a war to defend world peace and uphold justice. The people of the world are supporting them and sympathizing with them; they are their reserve forces in various forms. Our four million citizens of Beijing are their reserve forces, and the six hundred million people of China are also their reserve forces. Final victory will surely belong to the heroic Egyptian people and to the people who defend peace and advocate justice. Since the Suez Canal issue arose, our Chinese government, the Chinese people, all nationalities, all classes, and all democratic parties have consistently stood on the side of the Egyptian people, issuing stern and righteous statements and protests, condemning and opposing the colonialists' aggressive intentions. Now that our people across the country see the Anglo-French imperialists openly waging a war of aggression, they are even more angry and excited. Demonstrations and parades are being held throughout the country to support our government's policy of defending peace and opposing aggression, to support the Egyptian people's war of resistance, and to call on all peace-loving people around the world to unite and fight for the common cause of defending peace and opposing aggression. The Chinese people must unite more closely, heighten vigilance, strengthen all construction work, and enhance the strength to aid the Egyptian people in their war of resistance.
    People of the world who love peace, unite!
    Down with British and French imperialism!
    Extinguish the flames of war that are destroying world peace!
    Long live the victory of the Egyptian people's war of resistance!
    Long live world peace!

    章伯钧的讲话
    同胞们：现在世界和平和文明受到了严重的威胁，遭到了局部的破坏。这就是亚非两大洲纽带地域英雄的埃及共和国受到了英法殖民帝国主义者同他们的伙伴以色列发起的海陆空军的侵略进攻。埃及和平无辜的人民，同美丽的城市遭受了残酷的屠杀和轰炸。埃及国家领土遭受了敌人的占领，并且侵略正在继续扩张。英法殖民帝国主义侵略者为了霸占苏伊士运河，为了掠夺中近东石油资源，为了扩张殖民领土和压迫弱小民族国家，竟公然不顾及全世界人民（包括英法人民在内）的反对、抗议、谴责和呼吁，不顾及破坏联合国宪章、国际公法、国际条约，更不顾及一切爱好和平、主张公道国家的劝告和警告，采取了违背正义、违背人道、破坏和平、毁灭文明的野蛮的疯狂的侵略战争的政策。这一种罪恶滔天的罪行是一切爱好和平、文明、民主、自由、独立、平等的人民绝对不能容忍的。这一种杀人放火横行霸道掠夺抢劫的强盗行为，必然在英勇的埃及人民和全世界人民的力量共同反击之下遭到彻底的悲惨的失败。现在英雄的埃及人民为了人类的尊严，为了人类的正义，为了世界和平，为了国家领土完整、国家主权、民族独立和为了子子孙孙的生存幸福，已经像钢铁一般地团结起来，在他们英明领袖领导之下，进行了全国抗战，反抗侵略。今天，英雄的埃及人民所进行的伟大的全民抗战，也就是为保卫世界和平和伸张正义而战。全世界人民都在支援他们，同情他们，都是他们各式各样的后备军。我们全北京市四百万市民就是他们的后备军，全中国六亿人民也都是他们的后备军。最后的胜利一定属于英雄的埃及人民，属于保卫和平主张正义的人民。我们中国政府、中国人民、各民族、各阶级、各民主党派自从苏伊士运河问题发生以来，就一直站在埃及人民方面，发表了词严义正的声明和抗议，谴责和反对殖民主义者的侵略的企图。现在我们全国人民看到英法帝国主义公然进行侵略战争更加愤怒，更加激动起来，全国举行示威游行，支持我们政府保卫和平反对侵略的政策，声援埃及人民抗战，要求全世界一切爱好和平人民一致起来为保卫和平反对侵略的共同事业而奋斗。中国人民要更加团结起来，提高警惕，加强一切建设工作，增强援助埃及人民抗战的力量。
    全世界爱好和平人民团结起来！
    打倒英法帝国主义！
    扑灭破坏世界和平的战火！
    埃及人民抗战胜利万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
