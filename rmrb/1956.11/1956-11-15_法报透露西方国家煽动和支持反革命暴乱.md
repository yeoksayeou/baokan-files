Xinhua News Agency, November 14th, dispatch from TASS, Paris, November 13th: Some articles published in French newspapers prove the fascist nature of the Hungarian riots.
    "Le Parisien Libéré" reporter, Gaigneux, said in an article that he met three Hungarians in Vienna who had participated in the counter-revolutionary riots. These three were all former members of the Foreign Legion who had participated in the war against the Vietnamese people. When the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries started the riots, they immediately went to Hungary from France. Gaigneux said that he learned from the conversations of these Hungarians that three hundred former Foreign Legionnaires on the side of the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries had already been sent to Hungary from France.
    "France-Soir" reporter Gaudet, who was in Budapest when the riots broke out, said that when the riots began in the Hungarian capital, "many of the reports about the situation in Budapest that I heard (broadcast by foreign radio stations) were fabricated. We also heard broadcasts from the 'Radio Free Europe' station in Munich, and its broadcasts, along with its tone and calls for riots, caused a lot of harm. Recently, many Hungarians have said to us: 'These broadcasts caused serious bloodshed.'"
    Gaudet described the atrocities of the Hungarian fascist bandits and their killing of patriots who fought to uphold the socialist system. The reporter said: "Several hundred such people were killed, they were hung upside down and beaten." He continued: "The most reactionary and blatant fascists openly expressed their anti-Russian sentiments. Mindszenty, who had just been released, attempted to speak on the radio and in newspapers as a national political leader… The Nagy government was swept away by the political incitement of some politicians who had ties to the Horthy regime in the past."

    法报透露西方国家煽动和支持反革命暴乱
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社巴黎13日讯：法国报纸刊载的一些文章证明了这次匈牙利暴乱的法西斯性质。
    “解放了的巴黎人报”记者加涅昂在一篇文章里说，他在维也纳会见了三个参加了反革命暴乱的匈牙利人。这三个人都是曾经参加反对越南人民的战争的外籍军团的人员。当匈牙利反革命分子一开始暴乱，他们就立刻从法国到匈牙利去。加涅昂说，他在这几个匈牙利人的谈话中知道，站在匈牙利反革命方面的三百个前外籍军团人员已经从法国被派到匈牙利去。
    在暴乱发生的时候在布达佩斯的“法兰西晚报”记者戈戴说，在匈牙利首都开始发生暴乱的时候，“我所听到（外国电台广播的）许多报道布达佩斯情况的消息都是捏造的。我们还听到‘自由欧洲’电台从慕尼黑发出的广播，它的广播以及它的语调和暴乱号召造成了很多恶果。最近许多匈牙利人向我们说：‘这些广播引起了严重的流血事件。’”
    戈戴叙述了匈牙利法西斯匪徒的暴行和他们残杀为维护社会主义制度而斗争的爱国者的情况。记者说：“好几百这样的人被杀害了，他们被倒吊起来，遭到毒打。”他接着说：“最反动和最露骨的法西斯分子公开表示他们的反俄情绪。刚被释放的明曾蒂就企图以国家政治领导人的身份在广播中和报纸上讲话……纳吉政府被一些过去同霍尔蒂政权有联系的政治家的政治性煽动卷走了。”
