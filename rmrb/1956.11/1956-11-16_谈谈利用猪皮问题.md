Raw material shortages are currently a major problem for the leather industry. If we take the resources and needs of 1953 (excluding military and export use) as 100, then the changes for this year and next year are as follows:

Year		Resource Situation	Actual Need	Need as % of Resources
1953		100		100		73.33
1956		165.7		244.2		108.32
1957 (Projected)	172.9		276.4		117.55

Currently, most of the raw hides for leather making in our country are cow hides. Pigskin has the greatest potential, but is used very little. At present, there are over 100 million pigs raised in the country, with 70 to 80 million slaughtered annually. If we could peel the skin off 10%, that would be 7 to 8 million hides, which could completely satisfy consumers' needs for leather products. Pigskin has a wide range of uses. The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe all use pigskin as the main raw material for leather making. High-end leather products in developed capitalist countries also use pigskin as a raw material. Therefore, in the absence of a synthetic leather industry in our country, fully utilizing pigskin is truly the main way to overcome the shortage of resources in the leather industry.

Some people believe that most areas of our country have a habit of eating meat with skin, and skinless meat is not welcomed by consumers. Some people believe that peeling 5.7 million hides, with each hide weighing 13 *shi jin* (a Chinese unit of weight, approximately 6.5 kg), would reduce meat supply by 74.41 million *shi jin* due to peeling, equivalent to more than 740,000 fat pigs weighing 100 *jin* each, and that peeling is especially inappropriate given the current insufficient meat supply. Moreover, skinless meat is prone to drying out, which leads to spoilage. These situations do exist, but they can be resolved. In actual life, not all meat skin is eaten, and discarding is very common.

Taking Chongqing as an example, in the past, *Nanhua* stores (stores selling dried goods and local products) could collect more than 1.2 million *jin* of dried shredded pigskin every year. A restaurant in Xi'an peels off several thousand *jin* of dried pigskin every year, leaving it to mold in the shed. Similar situations exist in Shanghai and Changsha. Pigskin thrown on tables in the canteens of government agencies is visible everywhere. According to understanding, large and small restaurants, eateries, and state organs and groups in cities consume approximately 20 million pigs annually. If one-quarter of the pigskin could be peeled, that would be 5 million hides. From the 20 million pigs consumed by citizens, peeling one-sixth would yield more than 3 million hides. The remainder, plus the pigskin that can be peeled from canned meat for export, and the areas with peeling habits such as Shandong, Jiaodong, and Wenzhou, can produce 6 million hides annually, which can completely solve the problem of cowhide shortage. Not utilizing these available pigskins should be considered a serious waste.

    谈谈利用猪皮问题
  　卢启民
    原料资源不够，是制革工业当前的一个重大问题。如果以1953年资源和需要量（不包括军需和出口用）为一百，那末今年和明年的变化如下：
    年　度　		资源情况　实际需要　需要为资源的％
    1953年　		100　	   100　	73.33
    1956年　		165.7　	   244.2　	108.32
    1957年（预计）　	172.9　	   276.4　	117.55
    目前，我国制革的原皮大部分是牛皮。猪皮的潜力最大，但用得很少。目前全国饲养的猪有一亿多头，每年屠宰七、八千万头，如果能剥下10％，就有七、八百万张，可以完全满足消费者对革制品的需要。猪皮的使用范围很广。苏联和东欧各人民民主国家无一不把猪皮做制革的主要原料。资本主义发达的国家的高级革制品也有采用猪皮作原料的。所以，在我国还没有人造皮革工业的情况下，充分利用猪皮，实在是克服制革工业资源不足的主要办法。
    有人认为我国大部分地区有吃带皮肉的习惯，剥皮肉不受消费者欢迎；有人认为剥皮五百七十万张，每张以十三市斤计，即因剥皮而减少肉食供应量七千四百十万市斤，相当于一百斤重的肥猪七十四万多头，特别是在目前肉食供应不足的情况下，更不应该剥皮。而且剥皮肉容易风干，促成损耗。这些情况是确实存在的，但是可以解决。因为在实际生活中，肉皮并没有全部吃掉，丢弃现象很普遍。
    以重庆市为例，过去每年南货店就可以收购碎干猪皮一百二十多万斤。西安市一家饭店每年剥下的干猪皮，就有几千斤，让它在棚子里发霉。上海、长沙也都有类似情况。机关食堂扔在桌上的猪皮到处可见。据了解，在城市中的大小饭馆、菜馆和国家机关、团体，每年大约食用二千万头猪。如能剥取四分之一的猪皮，就是五百万张。消费在市民中的二千万头猪里，剥取六分之一，就是三百多万张。其余还有出口罐头肉可以剥皮，加上山东、胶东、温州等有剥皮习惯的地区，每年可以剥皮六百万张，完全能解决牛皮不足的问题。这些可以利用的猪皮不利用，应该说是严重的浪费。
