Beware of "Aggressors Feigning a Ceasefire"
Syrian Prime Minister Calls for Vigilance

Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: Syrian Prime Minister and Military Commander Sabri al-Asali called for vigilance on November 10th.

In a statement broadcast by Damascus Radio on the evening of November 10th, the Syrian Prime Minister said: "I must reiterate that we are still at the beginning of the battle. Harsh days and painful stages still prevent us from laying down our burdens. The aggressors feign a ceasefire, but in fact are still plotting to launch attacks."

He went on to say: "We must remain vigilant without any relaxation until they have returned to their bases in their own countries." He said: Syria is "determined to fight to the final victory."

The Syrian Prime Minister said: "I must express my respect and gratitude to the leaders and people of the Soviet Union, who in this great disaster are a ray of light, a piece of hope, and a sharp sword on the side of justice."

    据新华社11日讯　叙利亚总理兼军事统帅萨布里·阿萨利11月10日号召保持警戒。
    这位叙利亚总理在由大马士革电台10日晚上广播的一项文告中说：“我必须重申，我们仍然处在战斗的开始阶段。严酷的日子和痛苦的阶段仍然使我们不能放下我们的重担。强夺者假装停火，事实上仍在策划发动攻击。”

    这位叙利亚总理说：“我必须向苏联的领袖们和人民表示我的敬意和感谢，他们在这次大灾难中是我们的一线光明，一片希望，和正义方面的一把利剑。”
