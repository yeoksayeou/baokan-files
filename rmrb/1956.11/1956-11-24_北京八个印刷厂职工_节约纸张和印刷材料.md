Xinhua News Agency, 23rd - Workers in eight printing factories in Beijing have saved a considerable amount of paper and printing materials such as ink and machine oil this year.

    The five printing factories under the Beijing Printing Company saved more than 57 reams of paper in October by utilizing waste paper scraps and suggesting changes to paper sizes to printing units. Workers at the Foreign Languages Printing Factory hold a pre-shift meeting before each shift to discuss conservation and technical issues. Their waste paper rate this year is 58% lower than the prescribed target, and 75.49% lower than the actual waste in the same period last year. The Beijing Printing Factory learned from the experience of relevant factories in Shanghai and implemented a "three-check" system of self-inspection, mutual inspection, and random inspection to reduce the defective product rate, saving more than 120 reams of paper in the first ten months of this year. The factory's workers also learned from advanced Soviet experience and replaced hide glue rollers with potato glue rollers, reducing the amount of ink used to print one ream of paper from the original 4.48 ounces to 2.6 ounces, saving more than 7,000 catties of ink from January to October.

    北京八个印刷厂职工
    节约纸张和印刷材料
    新华社23日讯　北京有八个印刷厂的职工，今年以来节约了不少纸张和油墨、机油等印刷材料。
    北京印刷公司领导的五个印刷工厂，由于利用废纸边和向印刷单位建议更改开数，10月份节约了纸张五十七令多。外文印刷厂的工人们每次上班前都开一个班前会议，研究节约和技术问题。他们今年的废纸率比规定的指标少58％，同去年同期的实际报废数比较，降低了75.49％。北京印刷厂学习上海有关工厂经验，实行自检、互检、抽检的“三检”制度，减少了废品率，今年十个月中就节约一百二十多令纸。这个厂的工人还学习了苏联先进经验，把牛皮胶滚改为土豆胶滚，使印一令纸所用的油墨由原来的四点四八两减少到二点六两，1月到10月共省下了七千多斤油墨。
