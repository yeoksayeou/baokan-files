    Vietnam News Agency Reports the Truth About the Quyen An Commune Riot
    Refuting Fabrications by American and South Vietnamese News Agencies
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 26th: The Vietnam News Agency was authorized on the 25th to refute the rumors spread by American and South Vietnamese news agencies and newspapers regarding the riots that occurred in several communes in Nghe An province, North Vietnam, and to report the truth about the incident.
    The Vietnam News Agency said: American and South Vietnamese news agencies and newspapers have recently published many reports about the events that occurred in Quyen An Commune, Nghe An province, claiming that the entire population of Nghe An province participated in a "rebellion" against the government, and that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent several divisions of troops, commanded by Chinese officers, to suppress the people, resulting in hundreds of casualties.
    The Vietnam News Agency is authorized to refute these reports, which are pure fabrications. The truth is that in mid-November, some saboteurs took advantage of the mistakes made in land reform to stir up discontent among the residents of Quyen An Commune and several neighboring communes. They incited residents to attack People's Army soldiers who were there to explain government policies. These saboteurs even incited the people to oppose and attack government workers and People's Army soldiers, resulting in the deaths of two people, one of whom was a soldier.
    The Vietnam News Agency said that the saboteurs have been arrested and order has been restored. Now, Quyen An Commune and other parts of Nghe An province are calm.

    越南通讯社报道琼安乡骚乱事件真相
    驳斥美国和南越新闻机构造谣
    新华社河内26日电　越南通讯社在25日受权驳斥了美国、南越的通讯社和报纸就越南北方义安省几个乡中发生的骚乱事件所进行的造谣，并且报道了这一事件的真相。
    越南通讯社说：美国和南越的通讯社和报纸最近就义安省琼安乡发生的事件发表了许多消息，说什么整个义安省的居民都参加了反对政府的“叛变”，还说什么越南民主共和国政府派了几师军队镇压人民，这些军队是由中国军官指挥的，冲突造成了数百人的伤亡。
    越南通讯社受权驳斥这些消息，这些消息纯粹是捏造的。真相是在11月中旬，一些破坏分子利用在土地改革中犯的错误，在琼安乡和它附近的几个乡的居民中间煽动不满情绪。他们煽动居民攻击当时正在那里解释政府政策的人民军战士。这些破坏分子甚至还煽动人民反对和袭击政府工作人员和人民军战士，结果打死二人，其中有一个是战士。
    越南通讯社说，破坏分子已经被逮捕，秩序已经恢复。现在，琼安乡和义安省其他地方已平静无事。
