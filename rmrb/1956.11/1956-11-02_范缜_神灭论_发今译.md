Fan Zhen's "On the Extinction of the Soul" - New Translation by Ren Jiyu

[Translator's Note] Many of Fan Zhen's works have been lost. The extant "On the Extinction of the Soul" is a surviving fragment of his complete works, published in 507 AD. Even within these fragmented remnants, it reveals a radiance that shines through the ages. This essay establishes Fan Zhen's immortal position in philosophical history. It is a militant essay advocating atheism, with argumentation and analysis, and strong logical consistency.

The essay is written in the form of self-questioning and self-answering. This was a popular style of argumentative essay during the Northern and Southern Dynasties, called "self-established guest and host." The "Question:" (guest) in the article represents the opposing view, and the "Answer:" (host) represents the author's affirmative proposition.

This essay also has some weaknesses. For example, on individual issues, the materialist viewpoint is not thorough enough, and the argumentation method is sometimes not rigorous enough. Some issues readers will distinguish themselves, and some issues need to be further studied and analyzed.

This article is translated based on the original text of "Hongming Ji" in the "Sibu Congkan" edition. When "Hongming Ji" has errors, some corrections have been made with reference to the original text of "On the Extinction of the Soul" quoted in the "Biography of Fan Zhen" in "Book of Liang."

    Question: You say that the spirit (Translator's note: The word "神" used in this essay refers to "spirit," but also to "soul." Those who advocated "the soul does not perish" at that time believed that it was the soul that caused people to produce spiritual functions. The soul could be attached to the human body, and after death, the soul would transfer to other places, but it would not be extinguished. Fan Zhen's "On the Extinction of the Soul" launched a struggle against this popular superstitious idea of "the soul does not perish." It is not appropriate to translate it as "soul," and it is also different from the meaning of spirit as we commonly use it today. Readers are asked to pay attention.) will be extinguished, how do you know it will be extinguished?

    Answer: The spirit is the form, and the form is the spirit. Therefore, the form exists, and the spirit exists; the form decays, and the spirit also perishes.

    Question: Ignorance is called the form, and knowledge is called the spirit. Knowledge and ignorance are fundamentally two different things. Spirit and form cannot be confused in principle. I cannot agree with the statement that form and spirit are the same thing.

    Answer: Form is the substance of the spirit (Translator's note: "质" has the meaning of "matter" and the meaning of "entity." Now it is translated as "substance"). Spirit is the function of the form. Therefore, the form refers to its substance, and the spirit refers to its function. Form and spirit cannot be separated.

    Question: The spirit is neither a substance, nor is the form a function, but the two cannot be separated. Where is its theoretical basis?

    Answer: [Spirit and form] have different names, but in essence, they are the same thing.

    Question: [Spirit and form] have different names. How can you say they are the same thing?

    Answer: The relationship between spirit and body is just like the relationship between sharpness and blade. The relationship between body and function is just like the relationship between blade and sharpness. It is called sharpness, of course, it is not the blade; it is called blade, of course, it is not sharpness. But without sharpness, there is no so-called blade; without the blade, there is no so-called sharpness. I have never heard of sharpness existing independently without the blade. How can you say that the form dies and the spirit can exist independently?

    Question: The relationship between blade and sharpness may be as you say, but the principle of form and spirit is not like this. Why do I say this? The substance of trees has no sensation, and the substance of humans has sensation. Humans have the same substance as trees, but have different sensations from trees. Doesn't this illustrate that trees only have one characteristic, while humans have two characteristics?

    Answer: That's strange! If humans have the same substance as trees as the form, and have the sensation different from trees as the spirit, then it can be according to your statement. In fact, the substance of humans [lies in the fact that] it has sensation, and the substance of trees [lies in the fact that] it has no sensation. The substance of humans is not the substance of trees, and the substance of trees is not the substance of humans. How can [humans] have both the same substance as trees and the different sensation from trees?

    Question: The reason why the substance of humans is different from the substance of trees is that it has sensation. If humans have no sensation, what is the difference between them and trees?

    Answer: Humans have no insensate substance, just as trees have no sentient form.

    Question: Isn't the form of a dead person an insensate substance?

    Answer: This (the dead person) is an insensate substance.

    Question: Since this is the case, it can be seen that humans do have both the same substance as trees and the different sensation from trees.

    Answer: Dead people have the same substance as trees but do not have a different sensation from trees. Living people have a different sensation from trees but do not have the same substance as trees.

    Question: Aren't the bones of the dead the form of the living?

    Answer: The living form is not the dead form, and the dead form is not the living form. They are fundamentally different categories. How can there be a living form but have dead bones?

    Question: If the living form is not the dead bones at all, then the dead bones should not be produced from the living form. Since it is not produced from the living form, then where do these (dead) bones come from?

    Answer: This is the living form that has turned into the dead bones!

    Question: The living form can turn into dead bones. Isn't it precisely because there is life that there is death? It can be seen that the form of the dead is also the form of the living.

    Answer: If [we use the argument] that a living tree becomes a dead tree [to reason], how can it be said that the substance of the dead tree is the form of the living tree?

    Question: The form of the living tree can turn into the form of the dead tree. It can be seen that the form of the dead tree is also the form of the living tree. It is like the form of strands of silk turning into the form of thread. The form of the thread is also the form of the silk. What's the difference?

    Answer: If [according to your statement] the dead tree is the living tree and the living tree is the dead tree, then it should wither when the tree is alive and bear fruit when the tree is dead. The living tree should not turn into a dead tree, because [according to your statement] the living tree is the dead tree, so the dead tree does not need to come from the living tree. [According to your statement] Since the living tree and the dead tree are the same, why not first turn from the dead tree into the living tree? Why must it first turn from the living tree into the dead tree? What is the reason for this? As for silk and thread, they exist simultaneously [not that the silk is destroyed before becoming thread], so they cannot be used as a metaphor for this debate.

    Question: When the living human form decays, it should die immediately. Why do people always die gradually?

    Answer: [This is because] all forms that are born and die must have a certain procedure. What happens suddenly will inevitably disappear suddenly; what happens gradually will inevitably disappear gradually. What happens suddenly is like a storm; what happens gradually is like animals and plants. There are sudden occurrences and gradual occurrences. This is the law of things.

    Question: You say "form is spirit." Then are organs like "hands" also spirit?

    Answer: They all have their spiritual aspects.

    Question: If you say that limbs like hands have their spiritual aspects, and the spirit can think, then limbs like hands should also be able to think.

    Answer: Limbs like hands have the feeling of pain and itching, but they do not have the thought of distinguishing right from wrong.

    Question: Are feeling and thinking the same thing, or are they two different things?

    Answer: Feeling is also thinking. What is superficial is called feeling, and what is profound is called thinking.

    Question: If this is the case, there should be two kinds of thinking. Since there are two kinds of thinking, are there also two kinds of spirit?

    Answer: A person has only one form, how can there be two kinds of spirit?

    Question: If there cannot be two kinds of spirit, how can there be both the feeling of knowing pain and itching and the thought of distinguishing right from wrong?

    Answer: For example, although hands and feet are different, they are still limbs of the same person; although distinguishing right from wrong and sensing pain and itching are not the same, they are still the spirit of the same person.

    Question: The thought of distinguishing right from wrong has nothing to do with hands and feet. What is it related to?

    Answer: The thought of distinguishing right from wrong is governed by the heart.

    Question: Is the heart the heart of the five organs? Is it not?

    Answer: Yes.

    Question: What is different about the five organs that only the heart has the function of distinguishing right from wrong?

    Answer: What is different about the seven orifices, and the functions they perform are not the same? What is the reason for this?

    Question: The function of thinking is not restricted in any way. How do you know that it is governed by the heart?

    Answer: Diseases of the heart will cause the function of thinking to be abnormal. Therefore, I know that the heart is the foundation of thinking.

    Question: How do you know that thinking is not entrusted to aspects like the eyes?

    Answer: If the function of thinking could be entrusted to aspects like the eyes, why would the function of the eyes not be entrusted to the aspects of the ears?

    Question: Thinking itself has no foundation, so it can be entrusted to the aspects of the eyes. The eyes have their own foundation, so they are not entrusted to other sensory organs.

    Answer: Why do the eyes have their foundation and thinking has no foundation? If thinking has no foundation in my form and can be entrusted to any place, then the magnified emotions can be entrusted to Wang Er's body; Li San's personality can be entrusted to Zhao Si's body. Is that so? It is not, right?

    Question: The form of the "sage" is just like the form of ordinary people, but there is ultimately a difference between ordinary people and "sages." Therefore, I know that form and spirit are two different things.

    Answer: No, pure gold has luster, and impure gold has no luster. How can pure gold with luster have impure substances without luster? From this point of view, how can the spirit of the "sage" be entrusted to the bodies of ordinary people? Naturally, the spirit of ordinary people will not be entrusted to the bodies of "sages." Therefore, Yao had eyebrows of eight colors, Shun had eyes with double pupils, the Yellow Emperor's forehead was like a dragon, and Gaotao's mouth was shaped like a horse. These are all special features of the external form of the body. Bigan's heart had seven orifices arranged side by side, and Jiang Wei's gall bladder was the size of a fist. These are all special features of internal organs. From this, it can be seen that the special features of "sages" are often different from ordinary people. "Sages" not only surpass the multitude in morality, but they are also different from ordinary people in form. The saying that the forms of ordinary people and "sages" are the same, I think is not appropriate.

    Question: You say that the form of "sages" must be different from ordinary people. Then may I ask, Yang Huo's appearance was like Confucius, and Xiang Yu's eyes were like Shun's. Shun, Xiang Yu, Confucius, and Yang Huo, their talents were different, but their appearances were similar. What is the reason for this?

    Answer: Minerals look like jade but are not jade, and chickens look like phoenixes but are not phoenixes. Such phenomena do exist in things, and humans are no exception. Xiang Yu's and Yang Huo's appearances [resembled Shun's and Confucius's] but were not truly similar. Their internal organs were different. Even if their external forms were similar, it would be futile.

    Question: It is understandable that there is a difference between ordinary people and "sages," and their forms are not consistent. "Sages" are all perfect, and in principle, there should be no difference. However, Confucius and the Duke of Zhou had different appearances, and Tang and King Wen also had different appearances. Therefore, it can be further proven that the spirit does not depend on the form.

    Answer: The reason why "sages" are the same as "sages" is that they all have the organs of "sages," but the organs themselves are not necessarily the same. Just as horses of different colors can all be fast horses, and jade of different colors can all be beautiful jade. Therefore, the Jishi Bi of the Jin state and the He Shi Bi of the Chu state are both priceless; Hua, Liu, Lu, and Li can all travel thousands of miles.

    Question: I have already learned that form and spirit are not two different things. It is true that the spirit perishes with the decay of the form, and the reasoning should be like this. May I ask, the ancient books say: "Establish ancestral temples for [ghosts and spirits], and the ghosts and spirits will enjoy it." What does this mean?

    Answer: This is the method of education of "sages." The purpose is to comply with the emotions of filial sons and correct the tendencies of laziness and unfaithfulness. The so-called making them divine and enlightening them, is what this means.

    Question: Boyou's ghost, wearing armor, disturbed the state of Zheng; Peng Sheng's ghost transformed into a wild boar and appeared. It is written clearly in the classics. How can it be considered that this is merely using the way of gods to educate people? (Note: Zuo Zhuan, Seventh Year of Duke Zhao, Boyou, a nobleman of Zheng, was killed in a civil war. Later, the people of Zheng often disturbed each other. Someone shouted, "Boyou is coming," and the whole city was frightened and ran around. The story of Peng Sheng is found in Zuo Zhuan, Eighteenth Year of Duke Huan, and Eighth Year of Duke Zhuang. Peng Sheng was killed, and the book records that Peng Sheng transformed into a wild boar and appeared.)

    Answer: Strange things are vague, sometimes true and sometimes false. There are too many people who die violently. I have never heard of them all turning into ghosts. Why would only Peng Sheng and Boyou turn into ghosts? One moment it is a person, and the next moment it is a pig. They are probably not Peng Sheng of Qi and Boyou, the son of the Duke of Zheng.

    Question: The "Book of Changes" says: "Therefore, understanding the situation of ghosts and spirits is similar to heaven and earth and does not violate them," and also says, "A car is filled with ghosts." What is the meaning of these words?

    Answer: There are birds and beasts, which is the distinction between flying and walking; there are people and ghosts, which is the distinction between hidden and obvious. As for people dying and turning into ghosts, and ghosts perishing and turning back into people, this is something I cannot understand.

    Question: What is the practical significance of understanding the principle of the extinction of the spirit?

    Answer: The harm of Buddhism to politics and the corruption of monks to customs are like a violent wind and dense fog, spreading widely. I am grieved by this social malady and want to save it from its sinking. People would rather ruin their families to seek monks and worship Buddha, but they do not care for relatives or pity the poor. What is the reason for this? It is because there are too many selfish plans and too little intention to save people. Therefore, when giving a handful of rice to a poor friend, the emotion of stinginess is revealed on the face; when donating thousands of stones of grain to wealthy monks, one feels comfortable from the heart to the pores. Isn't it because monks have exaggerated promises of advance payment (Translator's note: refers to the monks' lies that giving alms can enter heaven), and poor friends have no return of even half a pint? Helping people is not about saving them from their urgent needs, and doing good deeds is only for selfish purposes. [Buddhism] deceives people with vague lies, frightens people with the pain of hell, lures people with exaggerated words, and attracts people with the happiness of heaven. Therefore, it makes people abandon the clothing of Confucian scholars and put on the robes of monks; abolish traditional ritual vessels and put on water bottles and begging bowls (Note: Kasaya and bottles and bowls are the clothes and utensils of monks, which were introduced from India and are different from the ethnic customs of China at that time); families are separated from each other; everyone's descendants are extinguished! To the point that soldiers are useless in the ranks, officials are vacant in the organs, grain is eaten up by idle monks, and wealth is exhausted by extravagant temple buildings! Bad people are rampant and cannot be prohibited, but they chant "Amitabha" loudly! All of this is caused by Buddhism. If its source is not curbed, its harm will have no boundaries.

    If it can be recognized that the generation of all things is due to its own causes, the complex phenomena are entirely its own changes, suddenly they occur by themselves, and suddenly they perish by themselves. There is no need to prevent its occurrence, and there is no need to grieve its perishing. Following the laws of nature, everyone is satisfied with their own nature: laborers are content with their fields, and rulers maintain their simplicity. After planting the fields, then eating, the grain will not be exhausted; after raising silkworms, then making clothes, the clothes will not be exhausted. Those below offer the excess products to those above; those above treat those below with a non-interfering attitude. In this way, life can be preserved, parents can be supported, oneself can be satisfied, others can be satisfied, the country can be stabilized, and the monarch can dominate. All of this is due to this principle!

    范缜“神灭论”发今译
    任继愈
    【译者附记】范缜有许多著作都失散了，现存的“神灭论”是他全部著作中残存的一部分，发表在507年。就在这些断简残篇中，已透露出照耀千古的光芒，这篇论文奠定了范缜在哲学史上不朽的地位。这是一篇充满了战斗性、宣扬无神论的论文，它有论证、有分析，逻辑性也相当强。
    论文是用自己设问，自己答复的方式写的。这是南北朝时流行的辩论文的体裁，叫做“自设宾主”。文章中的“问曰”（宾）代表反面的意见，“答曰”（主）代表作者正面的主张。
    这篇论文也有一些弱点，比如说，在个别问题上唯物主义的观点不够彻底，在论证方法上有时不够严密。有些问题读者自己会辨别，也有些问题要进一步来研究、分析。
    本文是根据“四部丛刊”本“弘明集”的原文译出的。“弘明集”有错误时，就参照“梁书”的“范缜传”所引用的“神灭论”原文作了一些校正。
    问：您说精神（译者按：这篇论文中所用的“神”字，固然指的“精神”，但也指的“灵魂”。当时主张“神不灭”的人，认为使人产生精神作用的是灵魂，灵魂可以附在人的身体上，人死后，灵魂又转移到其他的地方，但不会消灭。范缜的神灭论就是针对当时流行的这种“灵魂不灭”的迷信思想展开斗争的。译作“灵魂”不太妥当，译作“精神”也和今天我们常用的精神的含义有差别。希望读者注意。）会消灭，怎样知道它会消灭呢？
    答：精神就是形体，形体就是精神，因此，形体存在，精神才存在，形体衰亡，精神也就消灭。
    问：无知，才叫做形体，有知，才叫做精神。有知和无知根本是两回事，精神和形体，原则上不能混为一谈。形体和精神是一回事的说法，不是我所能同意的。
    答：形体是精神的质体（译者按：“质”有“物质”的意义，又有“实体”的意义，现在把它译为“质体”），精神是形体的作用。所以形体是指的它的质体，精神是指的它的作用。形体和精神不能割裂。
    问：精神既不是质体，形体又不是作用，但二者又不能割裂，它的理论根据在哪里？
    答：〔精神和形体〕名称不同，而实质上是一回事。
    问：〔精神和形体〕名称既然不同，如何能说是一回事？
    答：精神和身体的关系，恰如锋利和刀刃的关系一样。身体和作用的关系，恰如刀刃和锋利的关系一样。既叫做锋利，当然不是刀刃；既叫做刀刃，当然不是锋利。但是离开了锋利就无所谓刀刃，离开了刀刃就无所谓锋利。从来没有听说过刀刃不存在而锋利单独存在的，哪能说形体死亡而精神能单独存在？
    问：刀刃和锋利的关系，可能像您所说的那样，但是形体和精神，它的道理却不是这样。为什么这样说呢？树木的质体是没有知觉的，人类的质体是有知觉的。人类既有相同于树木的质体，却有不同于树木的知觉。岂不是说明了树木只有一种特性，人类有两种特性吗？
    答：这话可奇怪了！人类若有以相同于树木的质体作为形体，又有以相异于树木的知觉作为精神，倒可以照您的说法；事实上人类的质体，〔就在于它〕有知觉，树木的质体，〔就在于它〕没有知觉。人类的质体不是树木的质体，树木的质体也不是人类的质体。〔人类〕怎么可能既有同于树木的质体，又有异于树木的知觉呢？
    问：人类的质体之所以不同于树木的质体的地方，就在于它有知觉。人类若是没有知觉，它和树木有什么区别呢？
    答：人类没有无知觉的质体，恰如树木没有有知觉的形体一样。
    问：死人的形体岂不就是没有知觉的体质吗？
    答：这（死人）是没有知觉的质体。
    问：既然这样，可见人类确实既有相同于树木的质体又有不同于树木的知觉了。
    答：死人虽然有相同于树木的质体却没有不同于树木的知觉；活人虽有不同于树木的知觉，却没有相同于树木的质体。
    问：死人的骨胳不就是活人的形体吗？
    答：活的形体不是死的形体，死的形体也不是活的形体，根本是不同的两类，怎能有活人的形体却有死人的骨胳呢？
    问：如果活人的形体根本不是死人的骨胳，死人的骨胳也就应当不从活人的形体产生。既然不从活人的形体产生，那末这（死人的）骨胳是从哪里来的？
    答：这是活人的形体变成了死人的骨胳的啊！
    问：活人的形体能变为死人的骨胳，岂不正是因为有了生才有死，可见死人的形体也就是活人的形体了。
    答：如果根据活的树变成枯的树木〔来推论〕，枯树的质体怎能说就是活树的形体？
    问：活树的形体既能变成枯树的形体，可见枯树的形体也就是活树的形体。好像一条一条的丝的形体变成了线的形体，线的形体也就是丝的形体。这有什么不同呢？
    答：若〔照你的说法〕枯树就是活树，活树就是枯树，就应当在树活的时候雕零，树枯的时候结果。活树不应当变成枯树，因为〔照你的说法〕活树即是枯树，所以枯树不必从活树变来了。〔照你的说法〕活树枯树既然一样，为什么不先从枯树变成活树，一定先从活树变成枯树，这是什么道理呢？至于丝和缕是同时存在的〔不是丝消灭后才成为缕〕，不能用来作为这个辩论的比喻。
    问：当活人形体衰亡时，应当立刻死去，为什么人总是逐渐地死去呢？
    答：〔这是因为〕凡是生灭的形体，必须有一定的程序的原故。突然发生的，必然突然消灭；逐渐发生的，必然逐渐消灭。突然发生的，像狂风暴雨就是；逐渐发生的，像动物植物就是。有突然发生的，也有逐渐发生的，这是事物的规律。
    问：您说“形体即是精神”，那末像“手”这些器官也是精神吗？
    答：都有它的精神方面。
    问：如果说手这类肢体都有它的精神的方面，精神能思虑，手这类肢体也应当能思虑了。
    答：手这类肢体有痛痒的感觉，但没有辨别是非的思虑。
    问：感觉和思虑是一回事，还是两回事？
    答：感觉也就是思虑。粗浅的叫做感觉，深刻的叫做思虑。
    问：既是这样，应当有两种思虑了，思虑既然有两种，难道精神也有两种吗？
    答：人的形体只有一个，精神哪能有两种呢？
    问：如果不能有两种精神，怎么能够既有知痛知痒的感觉又有辨别是非的思虑？
    答：比如手足虽然不同，总归是一个人的肢体；辨别是非，感知痛痒虽不相同，也总归是一个人的精神。
    问：辨别是非的思虑和手足无关，和什么有关呢？
    答：辨别是非的思虑是由心这一器官主宰的。
    问：心器官是五脏的心吗？不是吗？
    答：是的。
    问：五脏有什么不同，而单单心有辨别是非的思虑作用呢？
    答：七窍又有什么不同，而所担任的职能并不一样，这是什么原故呢？
    问：思虑作用不受任何局限，何以知道是心器官所主宰的？
    答：心有疾病就会使思虑作用失常，因此知道心器官是思虑的基础。
    问：怎样知道思虑不寄托于眼这些方面呢？
    答：假若思虑作用可寄托于眼这些方面，眼的作用为什么不寄托于耳这一方面呢？
    问：思虑自身没有基础，所以可寄托于眼这一方面。眼自有它的基础，所以不寄托于其他感官方面。
    答：眼为什么有它的基础而思虑没有它的基础呢？假如思虑在我的形体上没有基础，可寄托在任何地方，那么张大的情感可以寄托在王二的身上；李三的性格可以寄托在赵四的身上。是这样吗？不是吧。
    问：“圣人”的形体也恰如一般人的形体，而究竟有一般人和“圣人”的差别。所以知道形体和精神是两回事。
    答：不然，纯金有光泽，杂质的金没有光泽。有光泽的纯金怎会有无光泽的杂质？由此看来，怎会有“圣人”的精神反而寄托在一般人的形体之中？自然也不会有一般人的精神寄托在“圣人”的形体之中。因此，尧有八彩的眉毛，舜有双瞳孔的眼睛，黄帝的前额像龙，皋陶的口形像马，这些都是身体外形的特殊；比干的心，七个孔窍并列，姜维的胆有拳那样大，这些都是内部器官的特别。由此可见，“圣人”的特殊，常常和普通人不一样，“圣人”不仅在道德上超出众人，就在形体上也是与众不同的。所谓一般人和“圣人”形体一样的说法，我认为不妥当。
    问：您说“圣人”的形体一定不同于一般人，那么请问阳货的相貌像孔子，项羽的眼睛像舜，舜、项羽、孔子、阳货，他们的才智不同而形貌相似，这是什么原故？
    答：珉像玉却不是玉，鸡像凤却不是凤，事物中确有这种现象，人类也不例外。项羽，阳货的相貌〔和舜、孔子〕相似，却不真相似，他们的内部器官不同，虽外形类似，也是枉然。
    问：一般人和“圣人”有差别，而形体不一致，这是说得通的；“圣人”都是圆满的，照道理讲没有两样，但是孔子和周公的相貌不同，汤和文王的相貌也两样，因此更可以证明，精神不依赖于形体了。
    答：“圣人”和“圣人”之所以相同，在于他们都有“圣人”的器官，但器官本身不一定相同。如同马的毛色不同却都可以是快马，玉的色泽不同而都可以是美玉一样。因此，晋国的棘氏璧，楚国的和氏璧，都价值连城；骅、骝、騄、骊都能远行千里。
    问：形体和精神不是两回事，已经领教了。形体衰亡精神也随着消灭，道理确也应当这样。请问古书上说：“为〔鬼神〕建立宗庙，鬼神飨受它”，这是什么意思呢？
    答：这是“圣人”的教化方法啊。目的在于顺从孝子的情感，并纠正偷惰不忠厚的倾向。所谓神而明之，就是这个意思了。
    问：伯有的鬼披着甲，惊扰郑国，彭生的鬼化为野猪出现。在经典中写得清清楚楚，怎能认为这仅仅是利用神道来教化人们呢？（注：左传昭公七年，郑国贵族伯有在内战中被杀，后来郑国的人民常常有人自相惊扰，有人喊“伯有来了”，于是全城的人，吓得乱跑。彭生事见左传桓公十八年及庄公八年彭生被杀事，书上记载彭生死后化为野猪出现。）
    答：奇怪的事情是渺茫的，或真或假。遭到凶死的太多了，没有听说都变成了鬼，为什么单单彭生、伯有就会变成了鬼呢？一会儿是人，一会儿又是猪，未必就是齐国的彭生，郑国的伯有公子啊。
    问：“周易”说：“因此认识鬼神的情况和天地相似而不违背”，又说“装满了一车鬼”，这些话的意义何在呢？
    答：有禽有兽，这是飞和走的区分；有人有鬼，这是隐蔽和明显的区分。至于人死变成鬼，鬼消灭了又变成人，这是我无法理解的。
    问：认识了精神消灭的道理，有什么实际意义呢？
    答：佛教对政治的危害，和尚对风俗的腐蚀，就像狂风迷雾一样，广泛地传播着。我痛心社会上这种弊端，并要挽救它的沈沦。人们宁可倾家荡产去求僧拜佛，但是不照顾亲戚，不怜惜穷困，这是什么原因呢？就是由于自私的打算过多，救人的意思太少。因此，送给穷朋友一把米，吝惜的情绪就流露在脸上；捐赠豪富的和尚上千石的粮食，就从内心到汗毛也感到舒畅。岂不是因为和尚有夸大的预偿的诺言（译者按：指和尚用布施可以进天堂的谎话），而穷朋友没有一升半斗的报答吗？帮助人，却不在于救人急难，做好事仅仅为了自私。〔佛教〕用渺茫的谎言迷惑人，用地狱的痛苦吓唬人，用夸大的言词引诱人，用天堂的快乐招引人。所以使得人们抛弃了儒者的服装，披上僧人的袈裟；废掉了传统的礼器，摆上了水瓶饭钵（注：袈裟和瓶、钵都是和尚的衣服和用具，是从印度传来的，和当时中国民族习惯不一样）；家家骨肉分离；人人子嗣绝灭！以至于使得士兵在行伍中无用，官吏在机关中缺额，粮食被游手好闲的僧众吃光，财富被奢侈的寺院建筑耗尽！坏人充斥，不能禁止，却高颂“阿弥陀佛”！这都是佛教所造成的。它的源流不加遏止，它的祸害就没有边际。
    如果能够认识到万物的生成是由于它自己的原因，复杂的现象完全是它自己在变化，忽然自己发生了，忽然自己消灭了。对它的发生既不能防止，对它的消灭也无须留恋。顺从着自然的法则，各人满足自己的本性：劳动者安于他们的田野，统治者保持他们的朴素。种了田然后吃饭，粮食是吃不完的；养了蚕然后制衣，衣服是穿不尽的。在下者把多余的产品奉养在上者；在上者以不干涉的态度对待在下者。这样，就可以保全生命，可以赡养父母，可以满足自己，可以满足别人，可以使国家安定，可以使君主称霸，都是由于这个原则啊！
