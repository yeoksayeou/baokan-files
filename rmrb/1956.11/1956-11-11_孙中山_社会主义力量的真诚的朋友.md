    Sun Yat-sen—A Sincere Friend of Socialist Forces
    Ma Hongmo

    November 12th of this year marks the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. The Chinese people commemorate this great pioneer of the Chinese revolution with reverence. Sun Yat-sen's life traversed a glorious and arduous path, as he progressed from a bourgeois democrat to a sincere friend of socialist forces.

    For nearly a century, especially since the late nineteenth century, the disasters of the Chinese nation have been extremely profound. The Chinese people and countless revolutionary pioneers have waged long and arduous struggles to break free from semi-colonial and semi-feudal rule and to achieve China's democratic independence. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was one of these revolutionary pioneers.

    After the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Kang Youwei, China's earliest bourgeois politician and reformist, attempted to lead China onto the path of national independence and capitalist development through top-down reforms. Simultaneously with Kang Youwei's reformist political movement, there erupted an anti-imperialist peasant movement with the "Boxers" as its organizational form, with the Chinese people attempting to drive imperialism out of China with their own armed forces. However, under the opposition of the domestic feudal ruling class and the intervention of international imperialism, both movements suffered tragic failures one after another.

    The Chinese feudal ruling class, having been violently shaken by domestic revolutionary forces, completely surrendered to imperialism after its defeat in the foreign war of 1900. This caused the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism to be concentratedly expressed as hatred for the alien rule of the Qing Dynasty. The people demanded the overthrow of this dynasty and the fundamental transformation of China.

    The bourgeois revolutionaries represented by Sun Yat-sen put forward the demands of the bourgeois democratic revolution amidst the gradually rising revolutionary enthusiasm of the people. Sun Yat-sen put forward the "Three Principles of the People" of the bourgeoisie, namely, "nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood," and the program of a bourgeois republic: "Expel the Tartars, restore China, establish a republic, and equalize land rights." This declared the end of the era of reformist political movements and spontaneous peasant resistance struggles. From then on, China entered a formal era of bourgeois revolution.

    The Xinhai Revolution broke out in 1911. The Xinhai Revolution ended the rule of the feudal autocratic empire of two thousand years, deeply rooted the idea of a democratic republic in the hearts of the people, and made it impossible for any counter-revolutionary element to continue to rule China in the old form, opening up a new and broad road for the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. Although the Xinhai Revolution ultimately failed due to the usurpation of the fruits of the revolution by the reactionaries led by Yuan Shikai, the significant role this revolution played in Chinese history can never be erased.

    After the failure of the Xinhai Revolution, domestic counter-revolutionary currents began to rise. In this dark and reactionary era, Sun Yat-sen waged an unyielding struggle against the Beijing government controlled by various factions of the Northern Warlords under the banner of "Protecting the Constitution." Although the struggle to "Protect the Constitution" had its progressive significance, the forces that Sun Yat-sen relied on in this struggle at that time were not the broad masses of the people, but the opposition within the camp of the great landlords and big bourgeoisie—the local warlords of the southwestern provinces. The opposition of this great landlord and big bourgeoisie camp to the Northern Warlords was very limited. They could both split and cooperate with the Northern Warlords, and the only criterion for deciding on the split and cooperation was their factional self-interest, which had nothing to do with Sun Yat-sen's democratic demands. Therefore, in the decade or so after the Xinhai Revolution, there were times of north-south division and times of north-south cooperation. Despite the fact that the counter-revolutionary camp was so often divided and united, Sun Yat-sen was still in a state of isolation and helplessness. In a private letter, he said that in the decade or so after the Xinhai Revolution, "a few party members who pleaded for the people were in a state of isolation and helplessness, and the bureaucrats and bandits then took advantage of them, not for a moment." Time and time again, failures did not force Sun Yat-sen to abandon the banner of democracy, but his inner pain is self-evident. Only after the victory of the October Revolution and the founding of the Chinese Communist Party did Sun Yat-sen find true allies.

    Sun Yat-sen welcomed the October Revolution, welcomed the assistance of socialist Soviet Union to the Chinese revolution, and welcomed the cooperation of the Chinese Communist Party with him. He put forward the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, and made new interpretations of the Three Principles of the People. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Mr. Sun Yat-sen was great not only because he led the great Xinhai Revolution (although it was a democratic revolution of the old era), but also because he was able to 'conform to the trend of the world and meet the needs of the people,' and put forward the three major revolutionary policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants, and made new interpretations of the Three Principles of the People, establishing the New Three Principles of the People with the three major policies."

    The nationalism in the old Three Principles of the People took "anti-Manchu" as its main content. The "anti-Manchu" democratic revolution certainly had its progressive significance, and the "anti-Manchu" appeal was also enthusiastically responded to by the broad masses of the people in the country, but the failure to put forward a clear slogan against imperialism was a major defect in the nationalism of the old Three Principles of the People.

    The Principle of People's Livelihood, centered on equalizing land rights, reflected the desire of the broad masses of Chinese peasants to be liberated from the feudal land ownership system, but it also reflected that what the revolutionary struggle required to abolish was only the feudal property ownership system and not others. This and the Principle of Democracy in the Three Principles of the People, which opposed only feudal autocracy and not bourgeois democratic politics, were also anti-feudal programs of the bourgeoisie. The feudal land ownership system was one of the root causes of the deep national disasters of modern China, and this ownership system became the material basis for imperialist rule in China. Therefore, fundamentally destroying the feudal land ownership system was the urgent requirement of the Chinese people for nearly a century. In order to realize this requirement, it is necessary to link the equalization of land rights with the peasants' acquisition of land. History has proved that without the policy of "land to the tiller," the slogans of equalizing land rights and democratic politics are just empty words. The old Three Principles of the People had defects in the way to solve this problem. Instead of relying on the masses to rise up and fight for political and economic rights, they set some frameworks (such as the method of equalizing land rights is to assess the land price of the world, and implementing democratic politics is divided into three periods: military administration, tutelage, and constitutionalism) to limit the masses from rising up. This precisely demonstrates the conservatism and compromising nature of the old Three Principles of the People.

    The contradiction between revolutionariness and compromising, the contradiction between the revolutionary program and the conservative methods adopted to achieve this program, is also a manifestation of the weakness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie. Because the old Three Principles of the People also contained the negative elements of compromising and conservatism, after the test of the Xinhai Revolution, especially after the Xinhai Revolution, in the context of rising domestic counter-revolutionary currents, it lost its role in mobilizing the people.

    The declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, issued in 1924, was a sign of Sun Yat-sen's democratic revolutionary thought developing to a new stage. The interpretation of the Three Principles of the People in this declaration was defined by Sun Yat-sen as the "true interpretation."

    The declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang pointed out that the Xinhai Revolution did not complete the task of opposing imperialism and feudalism, that imperialist oppression of China remained the same, and that domestic warlords relied on international imperialism to harm the people; therefore, it called on the people to rise up against imperialism and strive for national liberation.

    In explaining the Principle of People's Livelihood, this declaration linked the equalization of land rights with meeting the land demands of the peasants; and it proposed various measures to improve the lives of the working class. It called on workers and peasants to participate in the revolutionary movement, and affirmed: "Therefore, the national revolution must rely on the participation of farmers and workers across the country before it can be victorious, which is undoubtedly true."

    The New Three Principles of the People solved the national liberation movement by linking it to the workers and peasants striving for economic and political rights, thus overcoming the compromising and conservatism in the Old Three Principles of the People. The regime to be established by such a revolutionary movement could not be a bourgeois dictatorship, but a joint dictatorship of various revolutionary democratic classes. The explanation of the Principle of Democracy in the declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang clearly pointed this out: "The so-called democratic system in modern countries is often monopolized by the bourgeoisie and has become a tool for oppressing the common people. If the Kuomintang's Principle of Democracy is to be shared by the general public, and not to be privately owned by a few people."

    Nationalism against imperialism and striving for national liberation, the Principle of People's Livelihood of "land to the tiller," and the Principle of Democracy "shared by the general public," such Three Principles of the People embodied the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolutionary demands, and at the same time linked these two demands together.

    For the victory of the revolution in a democratic country, it is necessary to rely on the socialist Soviet Union's assistance to the Chinese revolution, and it is necessary to rely on the Chinese Communist Party and the workers and peasants it leads. This stipulates the inseparable link between the three major policies and the New Three Principles of the People. Without the three major policies, there would be no New Three Principles of the People, and there would be no victory of the Chinese democratic revolution. It was precisely in this way that Sun Yat-sen proceeded from the standpoint of a bourgeois democrat and became a sincere friend of socialist forces.

    Bourgeois revolutionaries in history, when they resisted the old system, often did not appear as spokespersons for a class at first, but as spokespersons for the interests of the whole people. They expressed the interests of the bourgeoisie as the common interests of all members of society, and regarded themselves as fighters for the interests of the whole people, declaring that they were friends of the people. The reason why they could do this was because, under the rule of the old system, the bourgeoisie had not yet elevated itself to the ruling class, and its interests were still somewhat related to the interests of the masses of the people, so bourgeois politicians could play the role of representatives of the interests of the whole people. However, as the revolutionary struggle developed, when the masses of the people gradually formed into an organized force and appeared on the historical stage with their own demands, bourgeois politicians immediately stood on the anti-people's position. Thus, yesterday's friends became today's enemies, and yesterday's enemies became today's friends. History has proved that these revolutionaries who call themselves friends of the people could only be spokespersons for the bourgeoisie in the past and in the present, and their words and deeds could not exceed the limits required by the bourgeoisie. The great democrat Sun Yat-sen, in his revolutionary activities in his later years, proved with irrefutable facts that he had surpassed the limits that past bourgeois revolutionaries had never been able to surpass.

    Sun Yat-sen gave the October Revolution an extremely high evaluation, believing that "With the Russian Revolution, the human race in the world gave birth to a great hope." He warmly welcomed the Soviet Union's assistance to the Chinese revolution, and asked the Chinese Kuomintang and the Chinese people to learn from the Russian Revolution. He repeatedly pointed out: "If our party does not take Russia as a teacher in the future revolution, there will be no achievement." This great revolutionary, in the last few minutes before leaving the world, was still concerned about the future of the Chinese revolution, and still did not forget to consolidate the great revolutionary friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. In order to adhere to the policy of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, he carried out a serious struggle with the right-wing elements within the Kuomintang. He called on workers and peasants to organize and strive for political and economic rights. Sun Yat-sen was not afraid of or hostile to socialist forces, but saw the dawn of the new century and the future of the Chinese nation from their development and growth. The slander and intimidation of all domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces could not shake his beliefs in the slightest. This is the highest point of Sun Yat-sen's democratic development, and it is also the reason why Sun Yat-sen will be immortal.

    It is not accidental that Sun Yat-sen was able to achieve such great achievements.

    Sun Yat-sen was once the banner of the awakening era of the Chinese nation. He opposed national oppression, was dissatisfied with the exploitation system, naively sympathized with the suffering of the working people, and carried out a firm and unswerving struggle for China's independence and democracy for a long time. These precious qualities and noble integrity made Sun Yat-sen never stick to the old ways. For the sake of the revolution, he always moved forward with the times.

    After the failure of the Xinhai Revolution, Sun Yat-sen had realized in painful groping that the reason why the past revolution could not succeed was "all due to the failure of the method." But what was the correct method? Sun Yat-sen could not answer this question at that time. The October Revolution opened a new era in human history, and the Chinese proletariat also stepped onto the political stage at this time, forming its vanguard—the Chinese Communist Party. The unprecedented drastic changes in domestic and foreign historical conditions saw the emergence of new revolutionary ideas, new methods, and new forms of struggle. Facts have proved that only the socialist country of the Soviet Union is a friend of oppressed nations, and only the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese workers and peasants are the basic forces of the Chinese revolution. Without the participation, support, and help of socialist forces, there would be no victory in the Chinese democratic revolution. History has determined that the true democrats of China must be sincere friends of socialist forces, and only sincere friends of socialist forces are true fighters against imperialism and feudalism and for China's independence and democracy. Sun Yat-sen supplemented and revised his democratic thought under this new historical condition, and announced that he would cooperate with socialist forces to jointly strive for China's independence and democracy. This is precisely the path that a great democrat must take.

    The Chinese working class is the inheritor of the great cause of all revolutionary pioneers in China. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have not only achieved the victory of the democratic revolution, but are also carrying out the great cause of socialist construction. The people of China and the Soviet Union have formed an unbreakable friendship, just as Sun Yat-sen said: "The two countries will join hands in the great battle to win freedom for the oppressed nations of the world and achieve victory." We have completed and far exceeded Sun Yat-sen's ideals. Commemorating Sun Yat-sen, commemorating this great revolutionary pioneer of China, will inspire us to move forward with confidence.

    孙中山——社会主义力量的真诚的朋友
    马鸿谟
    今年的11月12日，是孙中山先生诞生的九十周年纪念日。中国人民怀着崇敬的心情来纪念这一位中国革命的伟大先行者。孙中山的一生，经历着一条光辉而艰巨的道路，他从资产阶级的民主主义者进而成为社会主义力量的真诚的朋友。
    近百年来，特别是十九世纪末叶以来，中华民族的灾难是极为深重的。中国人民和无数革命先行者为了摆脱半殖民地半封建的统治，为了中国的民主独立，进行了长期的艰苦的斗争。孙中山先生就是这一些革命先行者中间的一个。
    1894年中日战争后，中国最早的资产阶级政治家、改良主义者康有为，企图经过自上而下的改革使中国走上民族独立和发展资本主义的道路。同康有为的改良主义政治运动同时，爆发了以“义和团”为其组织形式的农民的反帝国主义运动，中国人民企图以自己的武装力量把帝国主义逐出中国。但是，在国内封建统治阶级的反对和国际帝国主义的干涉下，这两种运动都先后遭到了悲惨的失败。
    中国的封建统治阶级由于受到国内革命力量猛烈的震动，在1900年对外战争失败后，彻底地投降了帝国主义。这就使得中国人民反对帝国主义、封建主义的斗争，集中地表现为对大清王朝异族统治者的仇恨。人民要求推翻这个王朝，从根本上改造中国。
    以孙中山为代表的资产阶级革命派，就在人民革命热情逐渐高涨的情况下，提出了资产阶级民主革命的要求。孙中山提出了“民族、民权、民生”的资产阶级的民主主义思想，提出了“驱除鞑虏、恢复中华、建立民国、平均地权”的资产阶级共和国的纲领，这就宣告了改良主义政治运动和农民自发性反抗斗争时代的结束。自此，中国进入了一个正规的资产阶级革命时代。
    1911年暴发了辛亥革命。辛亥革命结束了二千年来封建专制帝国的统治，使民主共和国的思想深入人心，使任何反革命分子都不可能再按照旧的形式继续统治中国，为中国人民的革命斗争打开一条新的宽阔的道路。辛亥革命虽然以袁世凯领导的反动派篡夺了革命果实而终归失败，但这次革命在中国历史上所起的重大作用却是永远不能磨灭的。
    辛亥革命失败后，国内反革命逆流开始高涨。在这个黑暗反动的年代里，孙中山在“护法”的口号下和北洋军阀各派所操纵的北京政府进行了不屈不挠的斗争。“护法”的斗争虽然有其进步意义，但当时孙中山在这一斗争中所依靠的力量，还不是广大的人民群众，而是大地主大资产阶级阵营中的反对派——西南各省的地方军阀。这个大地主大资产阶级阵营中的反对派，同北洋军阀之间的对立是非常有限的，他们同北洋军阀既可以分裂，也可以合作，决定分裂和合作的唯一标准是他们的派系私利，而同孙中山的民主主义要求完全无关。因此在辛亥革命后十余年内，忽而是南北分裂，忽而是南北合作。尽管反革命阵营是这样的时分时合、分合不定，而孙中山先生依然是处于孤立无援的境地。他在一封私人信件中说：辛亥革命后十余年来，“少数为民请命之党人，陷于孤立无援之苦况，而官僚与盗贼遂从而齮齕之，曾不须臾”。一次又一次的失败，固然没有迫使孙中山放弃民主主义的旗帜，但他内心的痛苦是不言可知的。只有在十月革命取得胜利和中国共产党成立后，孙中山才找到了真正的同盟者。
    孙中山欢迎十月革命，欢迎社会主义的苏联对中国革命的援助，欢迎中国共产党和他合作。他提出了联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策，对三民主义作了新的解释。正如毛泽东同志所说：“孙中山先生之所以伟大，不但因为他领导了伟大的辛亥革命（虽然是旧时期的民主革命），而且因为他能够‘适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群需要’，提出了联俄、联共、扶助工农的三大革命政策，对三民主义作了新的解释，树立了三大政策的新三民主义。”
    旧三民主义中的民族主义，以“反满”为主要内容。“反满”的民主革命固然有其进步意义，“反满”的号召在国内广大人民群众中也得到热烈反应，但是没有提出明确的反对帝国主义口号，是旧三民主义中民族主义的重大缺陷。
    以平均地权为核心的民生主义，反映了中国广大农民渴望着从封建的土地所有制度下解放出来的要求，但同时也反映了革命斗争所要求取消的只是封建的财产所有制而不是其它，这和三民主义中的民权主义所反对的只是封建专制主义而不是资产阶级的民主政治，同样是资产阶级的反封建主义的纲领。封建的土地所有制是造成近代中国民族灾难深重的根本原因之一，而这种所有制又成为帝国主义统治中国的物质基础。因此，从根本上破坏封建土地所有制，是近百年来中国人民的迫切要求。为实现这种要求，就必须把平均地权和农民的取得土地联系起来。历史证明，离开了“耕者有其田”的方针，平均地权、民主政治的口号不过是一句空话。旧三民主义对解决这个问题的办法是有缺陷的，它不是依靠群众自己起来争取政治经济上的权利，而是定出一些框子（如平均地权的办法是核定天下之地价，实行民主政治是分为军政、训政、宪政三时期等）限制群众起来，这正表现了旧三民主义中的保守性与妥协性。
    革命性与妥协性的矛盾，革命的纲领与为实现此纲领而采取的保守性的办法之间的矛盾，也正是中国民族资产阶级软弱性的表现。由于旧三民主义中还包含着妥协性与保守性的消极成分，经过辛亥革命的考验，特别是辛亥革命后，在国内反革命逆流高涨的情况下，它就失去了动员人民的作用。
    1924年发布的国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言，是孙中山民主革命思想发展到一个新的阶段的标志。这个宣言中对三民主义所作的解释，被孙中山定为“真释”。
    国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言指出：辛亥革命并没有完成反对帝国主义、封建主义的任务，帝国主义对中国的压迫依然如故，而国内军阀则依托于国际帝国主义残害人民；因此它号召人民起来反对帝国主义，争取民族解放。
    在说明民生主义时，这个宣言把平均地权同满足农民的土地要求联系起来；并提出了各种改善工人阶级生活的措施。它号召工人和农民起来参加革命之运动，并肯定地指出：“故国民革命，必恃全国农夫工人之参加，然后可以决胜，盖无疑者”。
    新三民主义把民族解放运动同工人、农民争取经济政治上的权利联系起来解决，它就克服了旧三民主义中的妥协性和保守性。这样的革命运动所要建立起来的政权，就不能是资产阶级专政，而是各革命民主阶级联合专政。国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言中对民权主义的解释，曾明确地指出了这一点：“近世各国所谓民权制度，往往为资产阶级所专有，适成为压迫平民之工具。若国民党之民权主义，则为一般平民所共有，非少数人所得而私也。”
    反对帝国主义、争取民族解放的民族主义，“耕者有其田”的民生主义，“为一般平民所共有”的民权主义，这样的三民主义才体现了中国人民反帝国主义、反封建主义的民主革命要求，同时把这两种要求联系了起来。
    为了民主国家革命的胜利，就必须依靠社会主义苏联对中国革命的援助，必须依靠中国共产党和它所领导的工农群众，这就规定了三大政策和新三民主义的不可分割的联系。没有三大政策，就没有新三民主义，也没有中国民主革命的胜利。也正是这样，孙中山从资产阶级民主主义者的立场出发，进而成为社会主义力量的真诚的朋友。
    历史上的资产阶级革命家，在其对旧制度进行反抗时，最初往往不是以一个阶级的代言人的姿态出现，而是以全民利益的代言人的姿态出现的。他们把资产阶级的利害表示为一切社会成员的共同利害，把自己看作是为全民利益而战的斗士，宣布自己是人民之友。其所以能够这样，是因为在旧制度的统治下，资产阶级还没有把自己提升为统治阶级，它的利害同人民群众的利害还有着某些联系，因此资产阶级的政治家得以把自己扮演成为全民利益的代表者。可是，随着革命斗争的发展，人民群众逐渐形成为有组织的力量，并带着自己的要求在历史舞台上出现时，资产阶级的政治家就立即站到反人民的立场上来了，于是昨天的朋友变成了今天的敌人，昨天的敌人变成了今天的朋友。历史证明，这一些自称为人民之友的革命家，他们过去和现在只能是资产阶级的代言人，他们的言论行为都不可能超过资产阶级所要求的界限。伟大的民主主义者孙中山，在他晚年的革命活动中，以无可辩驳的事实证明他超越了过去资产阶级革命家所从来未能超越的界限。
    孙中山给十月革命以极崇高的评价，他认为：“有了俄国革命，世界人类便生出了一个大希望”。他热烈地欢迎苏联对中国革命的援助，要求中国国民党、中国人民向俄国革命学习，他再三地指出：“我党今后之革命，非以俄为师，断无成就”。这位伟大的革命家，当离开人间的前几分钟，还关心着中国革命的前途，还念念不忘巩固中苏人民的伟大的革命的友谊。为了坚持国共合作的方针，他和国民党内部的右派分子进行了严重的斗争。他号召工人农民组织起来，争取政治经济上的权利。对于社会主义的力量，孙中山不是害怕更不是仇视，而是从他的发展壮大中看出新世纪的曙光，看出中华民族的未来。一切国内外反革命力量的污蔑恫吓丝毫也不能动摇他的信念。这是孙中山民主主义发展的最高点，也是孙中山之所以永垂不朽的地方。
    使孙中山所以能获得这样伟大的成就，并不是偶然的。
    孙中山曾是中华民族觉醒时代的旗帜，他反对民族压迫，不满意剥削制度，天真地同情劳动人民的遭遇，为了中国的独立民主他长期地进行了坚定不移的斗争。这样宝贵的品质和崇高的气节，使孙中山从不故步自封，为了革命的利益他永远地随着时代前进。
    辛亥革命失败后，孙中山在痛苦的摸索中已经体会到过去革命之所以不能成功，“皆由于方法未善之过”。但是正确的方法是什么，孙中山当时还不能回答这个问题。十月革命开辟了人类历史的新时期，中国无产阶级也在这时登上了政治舞台，组成了自己的前锋队——中国共产党。国内外历史条件的空前剧变，出现了革命的新思想、新办法、新的斗争形式。事实证明，只有社会主义的国家苏联，才是被压迫民族的朋友，只有中国共产党和中国的工农群众才是中国革命的基本力量，离开了社会主义力量的参加、支持与帮助，就不会有中国民主革命的胜利。历史决定了中国真正的民主主义者就必须是社会主义力量的真诚朋友，也只有社会主义力量的真诚的朋友，才是真正反对帝国主义、封建主义，为中国的独立与民主而斗争的战士。孙中山在这个新的历史条件下，对他的民主主义思想进行了补充和修改，宣布他同社会主义力量合作以共同争取中国的独立和民主，这正是一位伟大的民主主义者所必然要走的道路。
    中国工人阶级是中国一切革命先行者的伟大事业的继承者，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下不只取得了民主革命的胜利，而且正在进行着伟大的社会主义建设事业。中苏两国的人民结成牢不可破的友谊，正如孙中山所说的：“两国在争取世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进，以取得胜利”。我们已经完成并远远地超过了孙中山的理想。纪念孙中山，纪念这位中国伟大的革命先行者，将鼓舞着我们满怀信心的前进。（附图片）
