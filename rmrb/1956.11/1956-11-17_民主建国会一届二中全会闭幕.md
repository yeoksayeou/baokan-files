Xinhua News Agency, 16th - The Second Plenary Session of the First Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association concluded today.

　　The meeting adopted a resolution on the current work guidelines and tasks of the Democratic National Construction Association (DNCA). The resolution pointed out that the current work guideline and central task of the DNCA is to further cultivate and improve industrialist and businessman members to become backbone elements in the industrial and commercial circles, assist the state in thoroughly completing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and actively participate in socialist construction.

　　The meeting adopted a resolution on discussing several major principles of current concern. The resolution tasked the Standing Committee of the DNCA Central Committee to lead organizations at all levels to organize all members to conduct in-depth discussions based on the spirit of the resolution of this meeting, in order to achieve consensus in ideological understanding, so that the DNCA and all its members can better fulfill the historical tasks undertaken under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The meeting also adopted resolutions on the work report of the Standing Committee of the DNCA Central Committee, etc. The resolution approved the work report of the Central Standing Committee.

　　The First Session of the Second Plenary of the DNCA began on November 5. After reviewing and summarizing the work of the past year, the meeting focused on discussing several principled issues closely related to the current work guidelines and tasks of the DNCA - the assessment of the national bourgeoisie and the relationship between the working class and the national bourgeoisie, and formulated the current work guidelines and tasks of the DNCA. The discussion of several principled issues and other issues at the meeting was very enthusiastic, with a total of one hundred and twenty-five people speaking at the conference. Speakers generally carried out criticism and self-criticism, and the meeting was filled with a serious and earnest atmosphere.

　　Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the DNCA, delivered a closing speech at today's meeting. He said that the ability of this meeting to conduct in-depth discussions on political and principled issues, thereby clarifying the current work guidelines and tasks of the DNCA, is of great significance. If these political and principled issues are not clarified, the DNCA will obviously be unable to carry out its work.

　　Li Zhuchen said that our common aspiration is to thoroughly implement the resolutions of the meeting, so that every member of the DNCA can achieve consistent understanding and improve their thinking. Only in this way can the DNCA and all its members be able to exert greater strength in the final completion of socialist transformation and the active participation in the cause of socialist construction.

    民主建国会一届二中全会闭幕
    新华社16日讯　中国民主建国会第一届中央委员会第二次全体会议今天闭幕。
  会议通过了关于民建当前工作方针、任务的决定。决定指出民建当前的工作方针和中心任务是进一步培养和提高工商业者会员成为工商界中的骨干分子，协助国家彻底完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，积极参加社会主义建设。
    会议通过了关于讨论当前几个主要原则问题的决议。决议责成民建中央常务委员会，领导各级地方组织根据这次会议的决议精神，组织全体会员作深入的讨论，以求得思想认识上的一致，使民建和全体会员能更好地在中国共产党的领导下，完成所担负的历史任务。会议还通过了关于民建中央常务委员会工作报告等决议。决议批准中央常务委员会的工作报告。
    民建一届二中全会是从11月5日开始举行的。会议在检查和总结了一年多来的工作以后，着重讨论了几个和民建当前工作的方针任务密切有关的原则问题——关于当前民族资产阶级的估价问题和关于工人阶级和民族资产阶级的关系问题，并制定了民建当前工作的方针、任务。会议对几个原则问题和其他问题的讨论，非常热烈，在大会上发言的共有一百二十五人。发言的人一般都开展了批评和自我批评，会议充满了严肃、认真的气氛。
    民建副主任委员李烛尘在今天的会上致闭幕词。他说，这次会议能够就政治原则问题进行深入的讨论，从而明确了民建当前工作的方针、任务，这是具有重大意义的。这些政治原则问题如果不搞清楚，显然我会是无法进行工作的。
    李烛尘说，我们的共同愿望是把会议的决议很好地贯彻下去，使民建每个成员都能认识一致，在思想上有所提高，只有这样，才能使民建和全体成员都能在最后完成社会主义改造，积极参加社会主义建设的事业中发挥出更大的力量。
