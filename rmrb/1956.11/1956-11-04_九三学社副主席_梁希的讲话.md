    Liang Xi, Vice Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said:
    Ignoring the warnings of the Egyptian people and the opposition of world public opinion, British and French colonialists have brazenly launched a large-scale armed invasion of Egypt. British and French planes are bombing peaceful residents in Cairo and the Suez Canal area. Egypt's territory and sovereignty are being trampled upon, and the Egyptian people are being slaughtered by British and French executioners. The 600 million people of China are filled with immense anger at this naked act of aggression by British and French colonialists. We firmly support the statement issued by our government on November 1 regarding the British and French armed aggression against Egypt and pledge to do everything in our power to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people to defend national independence and resist aggression.
    The people of the world can see very clearly that the ultimatums issued by the British and French governments to the Egyptian government are nothing but a clumsy trick of robbers. Would a small country like Israel, with a population of just over one million, dare to launch an armed attack on Egypt, with a population of over twenty million, if it were not for the planning and support of Britain and France? The British and French colonialists' excuse of protecting the Suez Canal to carry out armed intervention in Egypt is even more unreasonable. The Suez Canal is a canal excavated by the Egyptian people on their own territory. The Egyptian government's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, which had been unreasonably controlled by British and French colonialists for a long time, is a completely justified and legal act and is Egypt's internal affair, in which no country has the right to interfere. The British and French governments have always held a hostile attitude towards this reasonable and legitimate measure by the Egyptian government, attempting to use force to undermine Egypt's sovereignty. Even after the United Nations Security Council made a "resolution on the six principles for resolving the Suez Canal issue," Britain and France repeatedly delayed holding negotiations with the Egyptian government, while secretly instigating Israel to launch an armed attack on Egypt, using this as an excuse to carry out armed aggression against Egypt. This blatant act of robbery by Britain and France is a violation of the United Nations Charter and the principles of international law, and a provocation against the Egyptian people, the Arab people, and all peace-loving people in the world. It has been strongly opposed by the people of the world, including the people of Britain and France.
    The fact that we are meeting here today shows that the people of the Chinese capital and the 600 million people of China stand firmly against the brutal aggression of the British and French colonialists against the Egyptian people. We want to seriously warn the British and French governments that your attempts to use a policy of war to suppress the vigorously developing national independence movements of the Asian and African people and to maintain your declining colonial rule are absolutely impossible. It has been a full ten years since the end of World War II, and many countries are engaged in peaceful construction, while some countries are still recovering from the wounds of war. The people of the world are against war and demand peace. What you are currently doing in Egypt is no different from the acts of aggression of Hitler and Mussolini in those years. Have you forgotten the disasters that Hitler and Mussolini inflicted on the people of Britain and France? Are not the shameful ends of these two fascist aggressors a bloody lesson for you?
    Brave Egyptian people, your struggle is not isolated. The Chinese people stand firmly on your side. All peace-loving and just people in the world support you. On behalf of all members of the Jiusan Society and the scientists, technicians, cultural and educational workers, and medical and health workers with whom we are associated, I express our full support to you. Final victory belongs to the Egyptian people and to all peace-loving people.

    梁希的讲话
    英、法殖民主义者不顾埃及人民的警告和全世界舆论的反对，悍然发动了对埃及的大规模武装进攻。英法两国的飞机正在轰炸开罗和苏伊士运河地区的和平居民。埃及的领土和主权，遭受到蹂躏，埃及的人民被英法刽子手们屠杀。中国六万万人民对于英、法殖民主义者这种赤裸裸的侵略行为，感到无比的愤怒。我们坚决拥护我国政府11月1日所发表的“关于英、法武装侵略埃及的声明”，誓以全力来支援埃及人民维护民族独立、反抗侵略的正义斗争。
    全世界人民都看得很清楚，英、法两国政府致埃及政府的最后通牒，完全是强盗们掩耳盗铃的一种手段。仅仅有一百多万人口的以色列这么一个小国，如果不是英、法从中策划和支持，难道它敢向有两千多万人口的埃及发动武装进攻吗？英、法殖民主义者以所谓保护苏伊士运河为借口，而对埃及实行武装干涉，更是没有道理的。苏伊士运河是埃及人民在自己的领土上开凿出来的一条运河，埃及政府把英、法殖民主义者长期无理把持的苏伊士运河公司收归国有，完全是正当的、合法的行为，而且是埃及的内政，任何国家无权过问。英、法两国政府对于埃及政府这种合理合法的措施，一直抱着仇视的态度，企图用武力来破坏埃及的主权，甚至在联合国安全理事会作出“解决苏伊士运河问题六项原则的决议”以后，英、法还一再拖延同埃及政府举行谈判，同时却暗中唆使以色列武装进攻埃及，即以此为借口，来武装侵略埃及。英、法两国这种明目张胆的强盗行为，是对联合国宪章和国际法原则的破坏，是对埃及人民、阿拉伯人民和世界上一切爱好和平的人民的挑衅，它已经受到全世界人民、包括英、法两国人民的强烈反对。
    今天我们在这里开会，就说明了中国首都人民和全中国六万万人民一起坚决反对英、法殖民主义者对埃及人民的横暴侵略。我们要严重地警告英、法两国政府，你们要想用战争政策，来镇压蓬勃发展的亚非人民的民族独立运动，来维护日落西山的殖民统治，是绝对办不到的。第二次世界大战结束以后到现在整整十年，许多国家都在进行和平建设，有些国家还在恢复战争的创伤。全世界人民都反对战争，要求和平。你们目前在埃及的所作所为，与当年希特勒、墨索里尼的侵略行为并没有两样。你们难道忘记了希特勒、墨索里尼对英、法两国人民所加的灾害么？这两个法西斯侵略者的可耻下场，对你们难道不是血淋淋的教训么？
    英勇的埃及人民，你们的斗争不是孤立的。中国人民坚决地站在你们一边。全世界爱好和平和正义的人民都支持你们。我代表九三学社全体社员和我们所联系的科学、技术、文教、医药卫生工作者，向你们表示全力支持。最后胜利属于埃及人民，属于一切爱好和平的人民。
