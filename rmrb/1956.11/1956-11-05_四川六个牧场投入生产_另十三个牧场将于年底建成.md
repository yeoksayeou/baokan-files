Six newly built pastures in Sichuan Province, including those in Suining, Nanchuan, and Leshan, and three expanded pastures in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Nanjiang have already gone into production this year. An additional thirteen pastures are scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.

These nineteen state-owned pastures are being built by the state to breed and improve livestock breeds and to supply milk for urban residents' consumption. Among them, the Chongqing and Chengdu dairy farms have more than 600 high-quality dairy cows, producing more than 10,000 catties of milk daily for the people of Chongqing and Chengdu. Many other pastures are primarily focused on breeding and improving livestock breeds. These pastures have already purchased more than 640 fine breeds of cattle such as Qinchuan cattle and Dutch hybrid cattle, more than 400 fine breeds of pigs, as well as a portion of fine breeds of livestock and poultry such as Xinjiang sheep, Soviet Gartz sheep, and Leghorn chickens.

    据新华社讯　四川省今年已有遂宁、南川、乐山等三个新建牧场和重庆、成都、南江等三个扩建牧场投入生产。另外还有十三个牧场也将在年底建成。
    这十九个国营牧场是国家为了繁殖和改良牲畜品种和供应城市人民牛奶食用的需要而建设的。其中重庆、成都两个乳牛牧场共有良种乳牛六百多头，每天能生产一万多斤牛奶供应重庆、成都两市人民食用。其他许多牧场以繁殖和改良牲畜品种为主要任务。这些牧场现在已买回秦川牛、荷兰杂种牛等优良品种牛六百四十多头，良种猪四百多只，另外还有一部分新疆羊、苏联盖茨羊、来航鸡等良种畜、禽。
