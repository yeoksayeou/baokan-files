    New Type of Open-Top Railcar

    The 冖12 type sixty-ton all-steel bottom-dump open-top railcar has been successfully trial-produced at the Qiqihar Railway Vehicle Manufacturing Plant.

    This open-top railcar is made of all-steel welding, with a solid structure and large load capacity, suitable for transporting goods such as coal, ore, coke, timber, and steel. When designing this open-top railcar, the Qiqihar Railway Vehicle Manufacturing Plant referred to Soviet data and, in light of China's specific conditions, modified some of the structure. For example, the weight of the car body structure was reduced from the original twenty-one rows of over twenty-three tons to just over twenty tons, which not only reduced manufacturing costs but also improved transportation efficiency.

    新型敞车
    冖12型六十吨全钢底开门敞车已在齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂试制成功。
    这种敞车是由全钢焊接的，构造坚固，载重量大，适于载运煤、矿石、焦炭、木材、钢材等货物。齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂在设计这种敞车时，曾根据苏联资料，结合我国具体情况，改变了部分结构。如把车身结构由原来的二十一列二十三吨多减低为二十吨多一点，不仅降低了制造成本，还提高了运输效率。　（马瞻）
