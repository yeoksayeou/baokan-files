    What is the Polish Western Border Issue?
    Q: What is the Polish western border issue?
    A: Poland's western border with Germany is the Oder-Neisse line. This western border of Poland was established after World War II. It not only conforms to historical reality, but has also been affirmed by solemn international agreements.
    The Polish territory east of the Oder-Neisse line and along the Baltic Sea has belonged to the Polish people since ancient times. However, due to the Polish feudal lords' policy of plundering the East, Poland's position was weakened, which gradually led the German feudal lords to seize the territory along the Oder River and the Baltic coast. After World War I, the Polish people widely launched a movement demanding the return of the land occupied by Germany, but because the Polish landlord and bourgeois government did not support the people's struggle, and because the Allied Powers did not agree, only a part of Silesia (Upper Silesia), the province of Poznan, and a part of the coast were returned to Poland. At that time, in order to give Poland access to the sea, only a narrow corridor leading to the Baltic Sea was delineated, which was the so-called Danzig Corridor. Most of Poland's Silesia and coastal areas remained in German hands.
    In 1945, the Soviet army defeated fascist Germany, and after the liberation of Poland, the Polish people recovered their original lost territories. At the same time, Poland's new borders were discussed and recognized in international conferences and documents. At the Crimean Conference of the leaders of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom in February 1945, a common agreement was finally reached due to the Soviet Union's insistence on safeguarding Poland's sovereignty and independence. The leaders of the three countries acknowledged that Poland should receive the territories in the north and west that originally belonged to Poland. In August of the same year, the Potsdam Agreement signed by the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom stipulated the division of the Polish western border even more clearly. The agreement stated: "The leaders of the three governments agreed that, before the final determination of the western border of Poland, the former German territory, namely the Baltic Sea west of Swinemünde, along the Oder River to its confluence with the western section of the Neisse River, then along the western section of the Neisse River to the Czechoslovak border line to the east, including East Prussia which was decided by this conference not to be under Soviet jurisdiction, and including the area of the former Free City of Danzig, should be administered by the Polish government and, for this purpose, should not be considered part of the Soviet occupation zone in Germany."
    In order to confirm the border between the two countries, the People's Republic of Poland and the German Democratic Republic issued a joint declaration in July 1950, jointly recognizing the Oder-Neisse line as the national border between Poland and Germany. On January 27, 1951, the delegations of the two governments signed an agreement in the city of Frankfurt on the Oder River, solemnly reaffirming the national border between the two countries, which had already become a reality after the war.
    The new border between Poland and Germany is a peaceful boundary between the two countries, which not only conforms to the interests of the Polish people, but also to the interests of the German people. However, the Western revanchist forces have not forgotten the interests of the Junker landlords in the coastal areas, the metallurgical enterprises in Silesia, and the shipyards in Gdansk. These forces constantly deny the rationality of the established existing Polish borders. They are stepping up the arming of West Germany, creating a threat to the security of the Polish border.
    The recent Soviet-Polish talks in Moscow are another heavy blow to the Western revanchist forces. The joint statement issued by the Soviet and Polish parties and governments stated: "The Soviet-Polish alliance, which has the same interests as the Soviet and Polish peoples, is a reliable guarantee of their security. This alliance is an extremely important factor in consolidating the independence of the People's Republic of Poland and defending the inviolability of its borders on the Oder and Neisse Rivers."

    什么是波兰西部边界问题
    问：什么是波兰西部边界问题？
    答：波兰的西部是以奥得—尼斯河与德国为界，波兰的这条西部边界是第二次世界大战以后划定的。它不仅符合于历史的现实，而且是由庄严的国际协定肯定下来的。
    奥得—尼斯河以东和沿波罗的海的波兰领土，自古以来就是属于波兰人民的。但是由于波兰封建主所实施的对东方掠夺的政策，削弱了波兰的地位，从而促使德国的封建主逐渐把沿奥得河和波罗的海沿岸的领土夺了过去。第一次世界大战以后，波兰人民曾广泛展开要求收回被德国占领的土地的运动，但是由于波兰地主和资产阶级的政府不支持人民的斗争，又由于协约国不同意，结果只有西里西亚的一部分（即上西里西亚）、波兹南省和沿海的一部分归还了波兰。当时，为了使波兰有出海口，仅只划出了一条通向波罗的海的狭长走廊地带，这就是所谓但泽走廊。波兰的西里西亚和沿海地带的大部分仍然留在德国人的手里。
    1945年，苏联军队击败了法西斯德国，波兰全国获得解放后，波兰人民才收复了原来的失地。同时在国际会议和国际文件中对波兰的新疆界也作了讨论和承认。1945年2月在苏美英三国领袖的克里米亚会议上，由于苏联坚持地维护波兰的主权和独立，最后达成了共同的协议。三国领袖承认：波兰应该得到原来就属于波兰的北部和西部的领土。同年8月，苏、美、英三国签订的波茨坦协定，对于波兰西部边界的划分问题规定得更加明确了。协定中说：“三国政府领袖同意，在波兰西部边界最后划定前，以前德国之领土，即自斯维内蒙德以西之波罗的海，沿奥得河至与尼斯河西段会流处，再沿尼斯河西段至捷克斯洛伐克边境线以东，包括经本会议决定不归苏联管辖之东普鲁士，并包括以前之但泽自由市区域，应由波兰政府管辖，且为达到此种目的，应不得视为苏联在德占领区之一部分。”
    为了确认两国的边界，波兰人民共和国和德意志民主共和国曾在1950年7月发表联合宣言，共同承认以奥得—尼斯河为波、德两国的国界。1951年1月27日，两国政府代表团又在奥得河畔的法兰克福城签订了一项协定，重新庄严地肯定了已经在战后成为事实的两国国界。
    波、德的新边界是波、德两国之间的和平的界限，它不仅符合于波兰人民的利益，也符合于德国人民的利益。但是西方复仇主义势力并没有忘记沿海地区的容克地主的利益、西里西亚的冶金企业和革但斯克的造船厂，这些势力经常否认已确定的现有波兰疆界的合理性，它们正在加紧武装西德，造成了对波兰边界安全的威胁。
    最近在莫斯科举行的苏波会谈，对于西方复仇主义势力来说，又是一次沉重的打击。苏波两国党和政府发表的联合声明中说：“同苏联人民和波兰人民有同等利害关系的苏波联盟，是它们的安全的可靠保障。这个联盟是巩固波兰人民共和国的独立和保卫它的在奥德河和尼斯河边界上的疆界的不可侵犯性的极其重要的因素。”　（竞）
