    Island Garden
    Ye Yao
      Early in the morning, there was a heavy rain, but as soon as the sun came out, it became scorching hot. I sat in a small sampan and crossed the bay to a small island. As the boat approached the shore, I asked the boatman who was rowing: "Which hilltop is Rat Mountain?"
    "Comrade, are you going to the Naval ×× Coastal Artillery Company? They live next to that small hilltop."
    He rowed the boat and looked up at a hilltop. Then, as if correcting a student who had asked the wrong question, he said loudly:
    "That mountain can't be called Rat Mountain anymore. In the past, there were many big rats there. Now, if you go and see, I guarantee you won't even find a baby rat, all wiped out by the naval comrades. Now, there are cannons on that mountain. Don't even mention the ones running on the ground, even the ones floating on the sea and flying in the sky, what kind of rat isn't afraid of our navy! The fishermen on our island have given the mountain a new name, Tiger Mountain..."
    This made me wonder: Could the rats here swim and fly? After the explanation of a fellow passenger, I understood: "Rats floating on the sea" refers to enemy ships, and "rats flying in the sky" refers to enemy planes. I looked at the boatman's face, a dark purple face weathered by the sea breeze and sun; the wrinkles crawling on his forehead and around his eyes indicated that he was at least over fifty years old. He was an old fisherman on this island, now a member of the fishing production cooperative. The proud expression on his face when he talked about our navy made you trust and be moved.
    The boat docked, and he stood at the bow, pointing to a stone-paved path and said to me: "Walk along this street, then turn right, there is a big road, at the end of the big road there is a gray tiled house, that is the navy's barracks... Go and see, their residence is like a garden!"
    Following the old man's directions, I walked through the narrow streets of the fishing village, turned right, and walked onto a wide road. On both sides of the road were tiled houses, the residences of the fishermen on the island. In front of a house hung with various brocade banners, a dozen young fisher girls were sitting, knitting fishing nets; a wooden sign in front of the door indicated that this was the work site of the island's fishing production cooperative. Near this house, there were two tall boilers, and several fishermen were baking nets; in the distance on the seashore, there was the sound of dinging and donging as they repaired fishing boats...
  The fishermen on the island are busy preparing to welcome the upcoming ribbonfish season!
      I walked along the road, with rice paddies and sweet potato fields on both sides forming a green expanse. In the fishing village, I hardly saw any trees, but on both sides of the road, I saw two rows of large-leaved trees that I couldn't name, standing neatly along the road, stretching all the way to the foot of the distant mountain.
    Walking to the end of the road, the scenery in front of me made people exclaim in their hearts: What an extraordinary place! No wonder the old man rowing the boat said it was like a garden! An elaborately woven bamboo fence enclosed a large sports field on the right, and the trees planted along the fence were lush and shady; several rows of neat barracks were located under the cliffs of "Tiger Mountain," with a large flower garden between each row of barracks; past the sports field was another pond of flower gardens; white and pink lotuses were in full bloom in a long lotus pond; grapevines were also planted next to the lotus pond. Walking along a seawall and turning into a secluded path, a wooden sign with an arrow read "Seaside Park"; further ahead, there was another wooden sign that said "Home of the Soldiers." This is not the army barracks we imagined, it is indeed a veritable "Seaside Park." The gray barracks where the soldiers live are hidden among the half-mountain groves and countless flowers. Fiery red cockscomb flowers, cannas, pale yellow roses, sky blue morning glories... all kinds of flowers are competing for beauty here. Where did the flowers and trees come from? They are not the local "residents" of the island, but came here from Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces to "settle down." A few years ago, the soldiers came to this weed-filled island, and they wanted to "make the island their home" and "turn the barren island into a paradise." They not only chopped off half of "Tiger Mountain" and built barracks with their own hands, but also removed the waist-deep weeds and built flower gardens. They wrote letters to their hometowns to ask for various flower seeds, and bought tree saplings from various places. They finally let the fragrance of their hometown flowers float on this island, and let the trees of the motherland grow on this hillside... And the road under our feet? It's not a muddy sheep intestine path that gets muddy when it rains. It was paved with pebbles of the same size, carefully selected by the soldiers from islands dozens of miles away. Gray and black smooth pebbles form all kinds of beautiful patterns: five-pointed stars, plum blossom petals... interspersed and embedded on the wide road. The soldiers gave them various names, this one is called "Glory Road", that one is called "National Defense Road", and another one is called "Hero Road"... After the rain, the pebbles are particularly clean and shiny. Walking on such a road, looking at the surrounding scenery, would you believe that this is on a small island in the East China Sea? Although there are no tiled roofs, red walls, carved beams and painted pillars of pavilions and pavilions, what is its true mountain and real water inferior to the Beihai Park and Zhongshan Park in Beijing?
    I walked with the company's political instructor along the winding communication trenches to the position of the coastal artillery company. The soldiers on duty were concentrating on monitoring the sea, and the thick-caliber coastal guns were squatting on the position with their heads held high and mighty. Standing on the hilltop, we looked out over the coast of our motherland. The continuous mountains in the sea are part of the Zhoushan Islands; dots of fishing sails are scattered on the sea, here is our inexhaustible big fish warehouse. Looking back at the whole island: three sides are plains, one side faces the mountains. It is just a small piece of land floating in the East China Sea, one of the more than five hundred islands in the Zhoushan Islands. In the past, like countless nearby islands, it was plagued by diseases and covered with weeds; now it stands on the eastern gateway of the motherland, and the soldiers have turned it into a seaside paradise with their own hands, into a steel fortress to defend the motherland...

    岛上花园
    叶遥
      一清早便下了一场暴雨，但太
  阳刚一露头，就炙热烫人。我坐着一只小舢舨，渡过港湾的海面，到一个小岛上去。船快靠岸时，我问摇橹
  的船夫：“哪个山头是老鼠山？”
    “同志，你是去海军××岸炮连的吧？他们就住在那座小山头旁边。”
    他一面摇橹，一面仰头往一座山头望望。接着，他像纠正一个问错了话的小学生似的，高声粗气地说：
    “如今那座山可不能再叫老鼠山了。过去那里老鼠又多又大，现在你去看看，保管连一只老鼠小崽也找不到啦，全给海军同志打光了。如今，那山上安着大炮，别说地上跑的，就是海上漂的，天上飞的，哪个样的老鼠不怕咱们的海军！我们岛上的渔民给山起了新名字叫老虎山。……”
    这话使我纳闷：难道这里的老鼠会游水，会飞吗？经过同船人的解释，我才弄明白：“海上漂的老鼠”是指敌人的舰艇，“天上飞的老鼠”是指敌人的飞机。我看看船夫的脸，那是一张被海风吹、太阳晒，变成酱紫色的脸；额头上、眼角边爬满的皱纹，说明他至少有五十岁开外。他是这个岛上的老渔民，现在是渔业生产合作社的社员。他谈起我们海军时脸上显出的自豪神情，使你信赖，感动。
    船靠岸了，他站在船头上，指着一条石板铺的小路对我说：“沿着这条街走，再向右转弯，有一条大马路，大马路的尽头有一片灰色瓦房，那就是海军的营房……。你去看看，他们的住处像个花园哩！”
    我按照老人的指点，穿过渔村的狭窄街道，向右转，走上一条宽宽的马路。马路两旁是一片瓦屋，这是岛上渔民的住处。一座挂满了各种锦旗的屋子门前，坐着十几个
  年青的渔家姑娘，正在结渔网；门
  前挂的木牌标明这是岛上渔业生产合作社的工作场地。这座房子的附近，搭有两个高大的锅炉，有几个渔民正在烤网；远处的海边上，响着叮叮咚咚修理渔船的声音，……
  岛上的渔民正在忙着迎接即将到来的带鱼汛呢！
      我沿着马路走去，两旁的稻田、番薯地连成油绿一片，几个妇女正在田里耕作。在渔村里，我几乎没有看到什么树木，但马路两边，我却看到两行我叫不出名字的大叶树，沿着马路整齐地挺立着，一直沿伸到远处的山脚下。
    走到马路尽头，眼前出现的景色，使人不得不在心里叫道：好一个不平常的去处啊！怪不得那位摇橹的老人说这里像个花园哩！编结精巧的竹篱笆围墙，把右边一个大体育场圈起来，沿着篱笆种植的树木，枝叶繁茂，绿树成荫；好几排整齐的营房座落在“老虎山”的峭壁下，一排营房和一排营房之间，都有一个大大的花圃，体育场过去又是一池花圃；一个长长的莲池里，白的和粉红色的荷花正在盛开；莲池旁边还种有葡萄树。走过一段海堤，弯进一条幽径，一个有箭头的木牌上写着“海滨公园”；再往前走，又有一个木牌，上面写着“战士之家”。这儿哪是我们想像中的军队营房啊，它的的确确是名副其实的“海滨公园”。战士们住的灰色营房，被掩藏在半山的丛树林和无数的花卉之间。火红的鸡冠花、美人蕉，淡黄色的月季花，天蓝色的牵牛花……各种各样的花，都在这里争艳。要问花、树是从哪里来的？它们可不是岛上的本地“居民”，而是从山东、安徽、江苏、浙江内地来这里“落户”的。几年前，战士们来到了这个杂草丛生的岛上，他们要以“岛、屿为家”，要把“荒岛变成乐园”，他们不但劈掉半边“老虎山”，亲手盖起了营房，而且把深得齐腰的荒草铲除，建造了一座座花圃。他们写信到家乡去要各种花籽，到各地买树秧，他们终于让家乡的花香飘在这海岛上，让祖国大陆的树木长在这山腰上……。脚下的路呢？可不是一下雨就稀泥的羊肠小道。那是战士们从几十里外的海岛上，精心挑选来的大小相同的鹅卵石铺成的。灰色和黑色的光滑石子，组成了各式各样的美丽图案：五星、梅花瓣……间隔着嵌在宽宽的路上。战士们给它们起了各种名字，这一条叫“光荣路”，那一条叫“海防路”，另一条叫“英雄路”……。雨过天晴，石子显得格外光洁晶莹。走在这样的路上，看着四周的景色，你会相信这是在东海里的一个小岛上吗？这里虽然没有碧瓦红墙、雕梁画柱的楼台亭阁，但它的真山真水，比起北京的北海公园、中山公园来，又有什么逊色呢？
    我同连的指导员，沿着弯弯曲曲的交通沟，走到岸炮连的阵地上去。值班的战士们正在聚精会神地监视着海面，粗口径的岸炮威武地昂着头蹲在阵地上。我们站在山头上，眺望祖国的海岸，海中连绵不断的山峦是舟山群岛的一部分岛屿；点点渔帆散布在海面上，这里是我们取之不尽的大鱼仓。回头环顾全岛：三面平原，一面临山，它只是飘浮在东海里的一小块陆地，是舟山群岛五百多个岛屿中的一个。过去这里像无数附近的海岛一样，疾病蔓延，野草满地；现在它站在祖国的东大门上，战士们用双手把它变成了海上乐园，变成了保卫祖国的钢铁堡垒……。
