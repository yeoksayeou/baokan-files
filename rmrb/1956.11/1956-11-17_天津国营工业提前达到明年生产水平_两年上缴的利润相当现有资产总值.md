Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 16th. According to recent statistics from the Tianjin Municipal Statistics Bureau, the total output value of Tianjin's state-owned industries, which accounts for one-third of Tianjin's total industrial output value, has already reached the planned level for 1957 ahead of schedule. Among the twenty-nine types of products included in the plan, the output of twenty-two types has reached the 1957 targets ahead of schedule.

Tianjin's state-owned industries are almost entirely old enterprises. Since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, the production level has been rapidly improved through preliminary equipment balancing and renovation. The state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant, which has developed the fastest, has increased its planned steel production by 81% this year compared to 1952, and steel products by 1.25 times, after adding and renovating steelmaking and steel rolling equipment. The machinery industry has expanded from the original repair and assembly factories into a number of factories capable of independently manufacturing machinery, producing large diesel engines, gasoline engines, precision machine tools, wires and other products. State-owned cotton textile factories produced more than 900 million meters of cotton cloth from 1953 to the end of October this year.

In order to renovate the old equipment of Tianjin's state-owned industries, the state has spent a small amount of investment in recent years; the investment figure is less than one-ninth compared to the amount of funds accumulated by these factories for the state during the same period. From 1953 to 1955, the profits remitted to the state by state-owned industries were equivalent to the total existing assets of Tianjin's state-owned industries.

    天津国营工业提前达到明年生产水平
    两年上缴的利润相当现有资产总值
    新华社天津16日电　天津市统计局最近统计，占天津工业总产值三分之一的天津国营工业，总产值已经提前达到1957年的计划水平。列入计划的二十九种产品的产量，有二十二种提前达到了1957年的指标。
    天津国营工业几乎全部是旧企业。在执行第一个五年计划以来，经过初步的设备平衡和改造，生产水平有了迅速提高。发展最快的国营天津钢厂，在增添和改造了炼钢、轧钢设备以后，今年钢的计划产量比1952年增加81％，钢材增加1.25倍。机械工业已经在原来的修配工厂的基础上，扩建成为一批能够独立制造机械的工厂，生产了大型柴油机、汽油机、精密机床、电线等产品。国营棉纺织厂从1953年到今年10月底，共生产了棉布九亿多公尺。
    为了改造天津国营工业的旧有设备，这几年来国家花费了少量投资；投资数字同这些工厂在同期内为国家积累的资金数字相比，还不及九分之一。从1953年到1955年，国营工业上缴给国家的利润相当于天津国营工业现有的资产总值。
