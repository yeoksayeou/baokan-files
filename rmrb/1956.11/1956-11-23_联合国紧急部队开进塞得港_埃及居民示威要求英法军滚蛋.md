Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd, Cairo Dispatch: A unit of the United Nations Emergency Force, consisting of approximately two hundred Norwegian officers and soldiers, entered Port Said from Abu Suweir near Ismailia on November 21st. Major Miller (Danish), from the UN inspection team, arrived in the British and French occupied zone by train with this unit.

When the UN force arrived in Port Said, thousands of Egyptian residents held demonstrations outside the train station, chanting slogans demanding the immediate withdrawal of British and French troops.

Armed British soldiers lined up to block the demonstrating crowds. Stockwell, the commander of the British and French occupation forces in Port Said, who was also at the train station, ran in front of the demonstrating crowd himself, arrested one person, and ordered guards to arrest another demonstrator holding a picture of Nasser.

As the UN force proceeded from the train station to their encampment, large groups of Egyptian children continuously chanted "Nasser, Nasser!" in front of the unit. After the UN force arrived at the encampment, a team of British soldiers quickly rushed to the streets to disperse the demonstrating crowd, but people who retreated to the side of the road continued to shout Nasser's name.

According to Western news agencies, when Stockwell, the commander of the British and French occupation forces in Port Said, was asked whether the arrival of the UN force meant that British troops would begin to withdraw from Port Said, he said: "I have no knowledge of that. As far as I know, that is not the case." He said he had not received orders to withdraw his troops. He also said that he did not know what responsibilities the UN force had in relation to the British troops in Port Said until he had spoken with Major Miller.

    联合国紧急部队开进塞得港
    埃及居民示威要求英法军滚蛋
    新华社22日讯　开罗消息：由大约二百个挪威官兵组成的一支联合国紧急部队在11月21日从伊士美利亚附近的阿布苏威尔进入塞得港。联合国视察小组的米勒少校（丹麦人）同这支部队一起乘火车到达英法侵略军队占领区。
    当联合国部队到达塞得港时，成千的埃及居民在火车站外面举行了示威，他们高呼口号，要求英法军队立即撤走。
    武装的英国兵列队挡住了示威群众。当时也在火车站的塞得港英法占领军司令司托克威尔自己跑到示威的人群前面抓捕了一个群众，并且命令卫兵拘捕了另一个举着纳赛尔像的示威者。
    当联合国部队从火车站走往宿营地的时候，大群的埃及孩子不断在部队的前面高呼：“纳赛尔，纳赛尔！”在联合国部队到达宿营地以后，一队英国兵立即迅速地赶到街上驱散示威群众，但是避到路旁的人群仍然高呼纳赛尔的名字。
    据西方通讯社报道，有人问塞得港英法占领军司令司托克威尔，联合国部队的到达是否意味着英国军队将开始撤出塞得港，他说：“我对这点毫无所知。据我所知，不是这样。”他说，他没有接到命令要他撤退他的军队。他还说，在他同米勒少校会谈以前，他不知道联合国部队同塞得港英国军队有关的责任是什么。
