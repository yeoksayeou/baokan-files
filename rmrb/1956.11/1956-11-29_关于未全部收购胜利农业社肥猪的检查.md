    Inspection Regarding the Failure to Fully Acquire Fat Pigs from the Victory Agricultural Cooperative
    The reader's letter "Why Not Buy These Fat Pigs?" published in the October 20th "Reader's Letters" column was a criticism of us, and we humbly accept it.

    It is true that the Victory Agricultural Cooperative had sixty to seventy pigs weighing over 100 catties each in early August, but more than ten of them suffered from swine fever (and later died), and some did not meet export standards due to their fatness, so the Wucun purchasing team only purchased twelve pigs. Because the purchasing personnel were temporary workers, their attitude was blunt, and they did not explain things clearly, which caused dissatisfaction among the members of the Victory Agricultural Cooperative. This was mainly caused by our failure to carry out the work in a thorough and specific manner. We have convened a meeting of all purchasing personnel at the Wucun purchasing team to study ways to improve purchasing in the future.

    关于未全部收购胜利农业社肥猪的检查
    10月20日读者来信栏登载的“为什么不收这些肥猪”是对我们的批评，我们虚心接受。
    胜利农业社8月初喂足一百斤以上的生猪确有六、七十头，但其中有十余头患有瘟疫（后来死掉），有的膘肥不合出口标准，所以吴村收购组仅收了十二头。由于收购人员系临时工人，态度生硬，解释不清楚，致引起胜利农业社的不满。这主要是我们布置工作不深入、不具体造成的。我们已在吴村收购组召开了全体收购人员会议，研究了今后改进收购的办法。
