    On "Doing It Yourself"
    Jing Yu
    When I talked with factory directors, they mentioned that the most difficult thing for them to deal with was the excessive number of tasks and "too many mothers-in-law." Higher-level administrative leaders included ministries and bureaus, departments and divisions. Locally, there were municipal and district Party committees, trade unions, labor bureaus, and education bureaus. Countless relationships constantly led to matters being directly assigned to factory directors.
    In Tianjin, each local industrial bureau had five to seven bureau directors, some specifically in charge of production plans, some in charge of technology, some in charge of personnel, some in charge of finance, and some in charge of security and hygiene... When they assigned work, they sometimes lacked unified planning. Often, at the same time, one bureau director would emphasize the importance of their assigned task and demand that the factory director be personally responsible, while another bureau director would also emphasize the importance of their work and demand that the factory director be personally responsible, and the third, fourth, and fifth bureau directors would also emphasize the importance of their work and demand that the factory director be personally responsible. In short, they were all superiors, and all instructions had to be carried out. In reality, these tasks were indeed important. However, the factory directors faced a dilemma. Some factories had two directors, one full and one deputy, while some factories only had one director, and some of the directors were newly transferred and lacked even basic industrial knowledge. How could a factory director handle so many important matters at the same time? In this situation, some factory directors lamented, "The more detailed the division of labor at the top, the more unlucky those at the bottom become." "If you get up late, the mothers-in-law are unhappy; if you get up early, your husband is unhappy." Although this saying is not entirely appropriate, it reflects a problem in the work.
    Despite how busy the factory directors were, these matters were directly related to production and were part of their daily responsibilities. As long as the factory directors made reasonable arrangements based on the actual conditions of their factories, and the superiors were considerate of the difficulties below, the problem could be handled relatively well. Unfortunately, some people often emphasized the importance of their work and did not understand the difficulties of the factories. In particular, some departments that were not directly related to factory production frequently assigned tasks to the factory directors. For example, the electricity bureau wanted to promote electricity conservation and required the factory director to personally attend meetings; the military service bureau wanted to recruit soldiers and also required the factory director to personally make a mobilization report; the bank wanted the factory director to help promote savings; the public security bureau wanted the factory director to conduct traffic rule publicity; and even department stores handled installment purchases, and when workers failed to pay on time, they would also ask the factory director to collect the debts. If the factory director could not "do it himself" or delegate it to someone else, they would think that you did not value their work or that you did not have a sufficient understanding of the political significance of a certain task. As a result, the factory directors were overwhelmed.
    Of course, the leader taking responsibility and doing it himself is an important guarantee for doing a good job. In order to combat bureaucracy, we often emphasize this point in our work. However, the reason we emphasize this point is not to require every leader to personally handle every major and minor matter under their management, but to require them to focus their main energy on the main aspects, grasp the key links, and do it themselves. From the perspective of each issuing unit, countless matters are very important. However, when these matters arrive at the factory together, they may not all be equally important. Some things need to be done urgently, some must be done slowly, and some things that cannot be done for the time being have to be temporarily put aside. In specific handling, some things need to be handled by the factory director personally, while some things can be resolved by the deputy director or relevant departments. If the factory director has to "attend to everything personally," regardless of the size of the matter, he is bound to become a hardworking and painstaking bureaucrat.
    In order to cherish the factory director's time and value factory production, comrades who go directly to the factory should consider the actual difficulties of the factory as much as possible and provide some concrete help to the factory. Documents issued to the factory should be arranged as uniformly as possible, allowing the factory director to handle them flexibly, and do not turn them into bureaucrats.

    关于“亲自动手”
    静宇
    跟厂长们接触，谈起他们最难对付的事情就是任务多，“婆婆多”。上级行政领导有部有局，有司有处，地方上有市委、区委、工会、劳动局、教育局，千头万绪的关系，都经常有事情直接下到工厂找厂长。
    天津市各个地方工业局都有五位到七位局长，有专管生产计划的，有专管技术的，有专管人事的，有专管财务的，还有专管保安卫生的……。他们布置工作时，有时缺乏统一安排，往往在同一时间里，这位局长强调自己布置的工作重要，要厂长亲自负责，另一位局长也强调自己的工作重要，也要厂长亲自负责，而第三第四第五位局长也都强调自己的工作重要，都要厂长亲自负责。总之，都是上级，指示都得执行，而实际上这些工作也确实都是重要的，可是，当厂长的就遇到难题了，有的工厂有两位厂长，一正一副，有的工厂只有一位厂长，而且有的厂长是新调来的，连工业基本知识都很缺乏。试问一个厂长怎能把这许多都很重要的事情同时办好呢？在这种情况下，有的厂长无限慨叹地说：“上面分工越细，下面越倒霉”。“起晚了婆婆不满意，起早了丈夫不满意”。这种说法虽然不尽合适，但反映了工作中的一个问题。
    尽管厂长如何忙得焦头烂额，毕竟这些事情都是和生产有着直接关系的，都是厂长分内的日常工作，只要厂长根据本厂实际情况，进行合理安排，上级又能体谅下面的困难，问题也比较好办了。可惜，有些人常常强调自己的工作重要，不体谅工厂的困难。特别是有些跟工厂生产没有直接关系的部门，也经常向厂长布置任务。例如电业局要开展节约用电工作，要厂长亲自开会；兵役局要征兵，也要厂长亲自作动员报告；银行要厂长帮助开展储蓄工作；公安局要厂长进行交通规则的宣传；甚至百货商店办理赊购业务，因为工人没有如期偿付也要向厂长讨账。如果厂长不能“亲自动手”，或者委托别人处理，他们就认为你不重视他们的工作。或者说你对某项工作的政治意义认识不足。于是，当厂长的大有应接不暇之概。
    当然，首长负责，亲自动手，是做好工作的重要保证。为了反对官僚主义，我们在工作上也常常强调这一点；但是，我们所以强调这一点，并不是要求每个首长对于他所掌管的大事小事都要亲自动手，而是要求他把主要的精力放在主要方面，抓住主要环节，亲自动手。千头万绪的事情，从每个发布单位看来都是十分重要的，但是，这些事情一齐到了工厂以后未必都是同等重要的。有些事情需要急办，有些必须缓办，还有些一时无法办到的事情只好暂时不办。在具体处理上，有些事情需要厂长亲自办理，有些事情由副厂长或有关主管部门就可解决了。如果不论大事小事，都要厂长“事必躬亲”，势必弄得厂长变成一个辛辛苦苦的事务主义者。
    为了珍惜厂长的时间，重视工厂的生产，凡是直接到工厂的同志，需要多多考虑工厂的实际困难，给工厂一些具体帮助，凡是下达到工厂的文件，尽可能统一安排，允许厂长机动处理，千万不要让他们变为事务主义者。
