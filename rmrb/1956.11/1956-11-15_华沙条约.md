    The Warsaw Treaty
    Question: What is the Warsaw Treaty?
    Answer: On May 14, 1955, the Soviet Union and eight other European countries, including Poland, signed a Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance in Warsaw. Because this treaty was signed in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, it is called the Warsaw Treaty.
    The Warsaw Treaty was signed under the following international circumstances. Western countries such as the United States, Britain, and France violated the obligations they undertook in the treaties concluded with the Soviet Union during the Second World War to jointly deal with German militarist aggression. On October 23, 1954, they signed the Paris Agreement, openly stipulating the restoration of German militarism, the establishment of West German armed forces, and the inclusion of West Germany into the North Atlantic bloc against other European countries. The resurgence of German militarism, which had launched two world wars in a single generation, could not but deepen the danger of war, thereby posing a serious threat to European peace and security.
    In order to ensure their own security, the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries decided to take necessary measures. In May 1955, the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania held a meeting in Warsaw. After consultations among representatives of the various countries, they jointly signed the Warsaw Treaty. Our government sent Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the State Council, as an observer to attend the meeting, representing our government's full support and cooperation for all the decisions made at the meeting.
    The ultimate purpose of the Warsaw Treaty was to "guarantee the peaceful labor of their people, to guarantee the inviolability of their borders and territories, and to ensure defense against possible aggression."
    In order to strengthen their defense capabilities, the Warsaw Treaty member states decided to establish a joint command of armed forces to command the armed forces of each country that the contracting parties allocated to its command in accordance with the agreement. These joint armed forces will be stationed on the territory of the contracting states according to the needs of joint defense and the agreements of these countries.
    The Warsaw Treaty was valid for twenty years. If none of the contracting parties submit a statement declaring the treaty invalid to the Polish government one year before the expiration date, the treaty will continue to be valid for ten years. However, if a collective security system is established in Europe, the Warsaw Treaty will become invalid from the day the all-European collective security treaty comes into effect.
    The Warsaw Treaty came into effect on June 4, 1955, after the contracting states successively deposited their instruments of ratification with the Polish government.
    According to the provisions of the Warsaw Treaty, Soviet troops are stationed in Hungary and Romania due to the needs of joint defense and the agreement of the government. In Poland, Soviet troops are stationed in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and the Warsaw Treaty.

    华沙条约
    问：什么是华沙条约？
    答：1955年5月14日，苏联和波兰等八个欧洲国家在华沙签订了一项友好合作互助条约，由于这项条约是在波兰首都华沙签订的，因此称它为华沙条约。
    华沙条约当时是在这样的国际形势下签订的。美英法等西方国家违背它们在第二次世界大战的年代里同苏联所缔结的共同对付德国军国主义侵略的条约中所承担的义务，在1954年10月23日签订了巴黎协定，公然规定恢复德国军国主义，建立西德武装部队并把西德拉入反对欧洲其他国家的北大西洋集团。曾在一代的生活里发动了两次世界大战的德国军国主义的再起，不能不加深了战争的危险，从而给欧洲和平和安全带来严重威胁。
    苏联和东欧社会主义国家为了保障自身的安全，决定采取必要的措施。1955年5月，苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚等八个国家在华沙举行会议，经过各国代表磋商的结果共同签订了华沙条约。我国政府曾派遣国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀以观察员的身份出席了这次会议，代表我国政府表示对会议所作出的一切决定给予全力的支持和合作。
    华沙条约缔结的最终目的是为了“保障它们的人民的和平劳动，保证它们的疆界和领土的不可侵犯性并确保对可能的侵略的防御。”
    华沙条约的缔约国家为了加强防御力量，决定成立武装部队联合司令部，统率缔约各方根据协议拨归其指挥的各国武装力量。这些联合武装部队将根据联合防御的需要和这些国家的协议在缔约国领土上驻扎。
    华沙条约的有效期限是二十年。如果缔约国各方在满期的前一年没有向波兰政府提出宣告条约无效的声明，条约将继续生效十年。但是如果在欧洲建立了集体安全体系，那末华沙条约就将从全欧集体安全条约生效的那天起失效。
    缔约各国先后向波兰政府交存了批准书后，华沙条约便从1955年6月4日起开始生效。
    根据华沙条约中的规定，由于联合防御的需要和政府的协议，苏联部队驻扎在匈牙利和罗马尼亚两国。在波兰，苏联军队是根据波茨坦协定和华沙条约而驻扎的。
