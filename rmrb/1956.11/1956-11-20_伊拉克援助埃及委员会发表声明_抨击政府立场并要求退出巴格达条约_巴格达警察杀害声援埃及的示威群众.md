Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 16th (TASS): The Iraqi Aid to Egypt Committee, jointly formed by representatives of various Iraqi parties and organizations, issued a letter to the Iraqi people, expressing its support for fraternal Egypt. It severely criticized the Iraqi government's position and insisted that Iraq should withdraw from the Baghdad Pact.

The letter to the Iraqi people, published in the Syrian "Flag Newspaper," stated that Nuri al-Said hypocritically says he supports Egypt, while at the same time allowing British pilots to move freely and giving them the right to use Iraqi airports. Nuri al-Said's declaration of a state of emergency nationwide is not to aid Egypt, but to hinder aid to Egypt and to isolate the Iraqi people from the people of other Arab countries.

The letter to the people concludes by calling on the working people of Iraq to carry out a resolute struggle to eliminate imperialism and its running dogs.

According to the Turkish News Agency, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said replied to the agency's reporter by telephone that Iraq had not considered the issue of withdrawing from the Baghdad Pact.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: According to a United Press International dispatch from Damascus on the 17th, many people in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, have been killed or injured by police in the past two weeks while participating in demonstrations in support of Egypt.

The report said that, according to a witness, police opened fire during a demonstration in Baghdad, killing ten people and wounding nine.

    据新华社讯　塔斯社大马士革16日讯：由伊拉克各党派和团体的代表联合组成的伊拉克援助埃及委员会发表了告伊拉克人民书，表示声援兄弟的埃及。它严厉批评了伊拉克政府的立场，并且坚持伊拉克应当退出巴格达条约。
    刊载在叙利亚“旗帜报”上的这份告伊拉克人民书说，努里·赛义德一面假仁假义地说他支持埃及，同时他又让英国的飞行员自由行动，给他们使用伊拉克机场的权利。努里·赛义德宣布全国处于非常状态，这不是为了援助埃及，而是为了阻碍对埃及的援助，为了把伊拉克人民同其他阿拉伯国家人民隔离开来。
    告人民书最后号召伊拉克的劳动人民为消灭帝国主义及其走狗而进行坚决的斗争。
    据土耳其通讯社报道，伊拉克首相努里·赛义德在电话中答复该社记者说，伊拉克没有考虑退出巴格达条约的问题。
    新华社18日讯　据合众社大马士革17日消息说，伊拉克首都巴格达有许多人在过去两星期参加声援埃及的示威游行时被警察打死或打伤。
    消息说，据一个目睹者说，在巴格达的一次示威游行中，警察开枪打死了十个人，打伤了九个人。
