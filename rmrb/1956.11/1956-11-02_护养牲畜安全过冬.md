Xinhua News Agency, October 30th – According to statistics from early October, nine provinces (regions) and cities, including Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Beijing, have ensiled a total of 2.4 billion catties of various feeds, a threefold increase compared to the total national ensiling volume last year. In addition, farmers in these provinces (regions) and cities have also cut and sun-dried 14 billion catties of green hay, with Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces having the most.

The above-mentioned silage and cut-and-dried green hay are mostly corn stalks, sweet potato vines, peanut vines, and grasses such as wild millet, barnyard grass, and alkali grass, which have less fiber, are easy to digest, and are rich in nutrients.

This year, Party committees and agricultural departments in these regions have strengthened their leadership over silage work, holding silage technology transmission meetings and silage technology training classes at the county level. Agricultural departments and livestock health stations in some areas have also organized silage work teams and silage technology guidance groups to go to various townships and villages for inspection and guidance. When carrying out this work, many agricultural cooperatives reasonably arranged labor, organized silage shock brigades and production teams, and launched silage and grass-cutting competitions.

Reserving Forage and Building Sheds
This newspaper reports that rural pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia are seizing the opportunity to store winter forage and build livestock sheds.

In early October, 125 young people from four pastoral production cooperatives, Jinxing, Aiguo, Hongqi, and Jinguang, in Junwang Banner, Ikezhao League, formed grass-cutting shock brigades and went to the surveyed grasslands to cut grass in shifts, determined to complete this year's grass-cutting plan. Keerqin Right Front Banner in Hulunbuir League has completed over 98% of its grass-cutting plan, and grass-cutting work in the Ulan Mao Du pastoral area is still continuing. Solun Banner's Hui Sumu organized about 20 cadres to go deep into various grass-cutting areas to strengthen leadership. The seven pastoral cooperatives in Baiyin Ao'er Gacha, Ongniud Banner, Zhaowuda League, also overcame the members' reluctance to cut grass and reasonably arranged current production by cooperative. Now, both regions have overfulfilled their grass-cutting tasks.

To strive to achieve "every livestock has a pen, every pen has a shed," over 10,000 livestock sheds of various sizes have been renovated and newly built in Heping Di Quan administrative region of Kalaqin Banner, Fengzhen County, Zhaowuda League, and other places.

Improving the Livestock Feeding System
This newspaper reports that the two agricultural cooperatives in Xinglongshan Township, Changling County, Jilin Province, have a total of 1,007 draft animals and 1,391 non-draft animals. These livestock are very weak, and the general draft animals only have half膘 (fatness), and some old and weak livestock are at risk of not surviving the winter.

The township leaders organized these two cooperatives to study this issue and proposed specific measures to ensure the safe wintering of livestock.

The first is to prepare sufficient forage. After detailed calculation, the two agricultural cooperatives still lack 500,000 catties of wild dry grass, so the cooperatives are making every effort to store 630,000 catties of silage, plus bean "kisses" and corn leaves, which will be enough. They are also preparing to leave sufficient livestock feed.

For some old and weak livestock, the method of "feeding in separate troughs and assigning dedicated personnel" is adopted. They should be used as little as possible, and even if they are used, they should do light work. A comprehensive renovation of all livestock sheds in the cooperative is being carried out.

In terms of use and feeding, improve the livestock handover system between feeders and teamsters. Specific requirements have been put forward for teamsters and feeders, the compensation for feeders has been reasonably adjusted, and a reward and punishment system has been established.

Ensuring Sheds are Impermeable to Wind and Rain
This newspaper reports that the First Agricultural Cooperative of Dujiao Village, Mabang Township, Da Jin County, Sichuan Province, has paid attention to arranging livestock for the winter this year. The cooperative recently held a meeting of members, deciding to build new sheds for those livestock pens without sheds, and repair the dilapidated livestock pens to make them impervious to wind and rain. All of the cooperative's more than 100 mu of corn stalks will be reserved as feed, and members will be mobilized to go to the mountains to cut grass and store enough winter feed.

The 20 members of the First Agricultural Cooperative in Dujiao Village have a total of 165 head of dairy cows, pien cattle, yellow cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep. In the past, everyone did not pay attention to livestock protection. The 26 mixed pens either lacked sheds or were dilapidated, unable to shield from wind and rain. At the same time, the frost and snow season is approaching, and winter forage has not yet been stored. At that time, people thought that it was inevitable that a few livestock would die in winter. Now that agricultural cooperatives have been established, the members have decided not to let the livestock suffer from cold and hunger in winter, and to avoid deaths.

    护养牲畜安全过冬
    青贮了大批饲料
    新华社30日讯　据10月初的统计，河南、河北、山东、山西、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古和北京等九个省（区）、市青贮的各种饲料已达二十四亿斤，比去年全国全年的青贮量增加了三倍。此外，这些省（区）市农民还割晒了一百四十亿斤青干草，其中以河南、河北、山西三省为最多。
    以上的青贮饲料和割晒的青干草，绝大部分是纤维少、容易消化而且养分丰富的玉米秸、甘薯藤、花生秧和野稗、马唐及碱草等草类。
    今年这些地区的党委和农业部门都加强了对青贮饲料工作的领导，以县为单位召开了青贮技术传授会和举办了青贮技术训练班。有些地区的农业部门和家畜保健站等，还组织了青贮工作组和青贮技术辅导团，分赴各乡、村巡回检查和指导。许多地区的农业社在开展这一工作的时候，都合理地安排了劳力，组织了青贮突击队和生产队，开展了青贮打草竞赛。
    储备饲草修搭棚圈
    本报讯　内蒙古牧区农村正抓紧时机为牲畜打储过冬饲草，修搭棚圈。
    10月上旬，伊克昭盟郡王旗金星、爱国、红旗、金光等四个牧业生产合作社的一百二十五名青年，组成了打草突击队，前往经过勘查的草场上分片流动打草，他们决心要完成今年的打草计划。呼伦贝尔盟科尔沁右翼前旗已完成打草计划的98％以上，乌兰毛都牧区的打草工作仍在继续；索伦旗辉苏木组织二十来名干部深入各打草场加强领导。昭乌达盟翁牛特旗白音敖尔嘎查的七个牧业社，也克服了社员不愿打草的思想，以社为单位合理安排了当前生产。现在，这两个地区都已经超额完成了打草任务。
    为争取做到“有畜就有圈，有圈就有棚”，昭乌达盟喀喇沁旗和平地泉行政区丰镇县等地，已经整修、新建了大小牲畜棚圈一万多间。
    健全饲养牲畜制度
    本报讯　吉林长岭县兴隆山乡的两个农业社，共有役畜一千零七头，非役畜一千三百九十一头。这些牲口都很瘦弱，一般的耕畜只能有半膘，有一部分老弱牲畜还有过不去冬的危险。
    乡的领导上组织这两个合作社研究了这个问题，提出了使牲口安全过冬的具体措施。
    首先是准备充足的草料。两个农业社经过详细计算还缺五十万斤野干草，社里就抓紧储存了六十三万斤青贮饲料，再加上豆“吻”子、苞米叶就够用了。又准备留下充足的牲口料。
    对一些老弱牲畜，采取“分槽饲养，专人负责”的办法。尽量少使用，就是使用也要干轻活。把全社的畜舍普遍进行一次整修。
    在使用和饲养上，健全饲养员和车老板之间的牲畜交接制度。对车老板和饲养员都提出具体要求，合理地调整了饲养员的报酬，建立了奖惩制度。
    做到棚圈风雨不透
    本报讯　四川大金县马邦乡独脚村第一农业社今年注意了安排牲畜过冬工作。社里最近召开了一次社员大会，决定要给无棚的畜圈盖上新棚，修好已破烂的牲畜圈，做到不透风雨；社里一百余亩玉米秆全部留作饲料，并发动社员上山割草，储备足够的过冬饲料。
    独脚村第一农业社二十户社员共有奶牛、犏牛、黄牛、马、猪、羊等一百六十五头。以往大家对护畜工作不重视，二十六个混合圈不是缺棚便是破烂，不能遮蔽风雨，同时，霜雪期快到，还未储备过冬草料，那时，人们认为，冬天死几头牲口是不可避免的。现在建立了农业社，社员们决定不让牲口在冬天受冻受饿，避免死亡。
