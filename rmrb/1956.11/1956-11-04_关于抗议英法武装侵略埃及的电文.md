    Telegram Protesting the Anglo-French Armed Aggression Against Egypt
    We are extremely indignant at the British and French governments' brazen launch of a large-scale armed attack on Egypt, and we express our strong protest against this heinous act of robbery by the British and French governments.

    We resolutely oppose the Anglo-French invading forces bombing Egyptian territory!
    We resolutely oppose the Anglo-French invading forces slaughtering the Egyptian people!

    The war of aggression launched by Britain and France against Egypt not only seriously infringes upon Egypt's territory and sovereignty, but also directly undermines peace in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the world, and threatens the safety of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. We absolutely cannot sit idly by!

    We solemnly warn the British and French governments that they must immediately withdraw all invading forces from Egyptian territory and immediately stop their reckless adventurism!

    The people of the capital of the People's Republic of China and the entire Chinese people will unite with the people of Asia, Africa, and other countries around the world to resolutely support Egypt's just struggle to defend its motherland, resist Anglo-French aggression, and safeguard peace, and to drive the Anglo-French aggressors and their tools of aggression out of Egyptian territory.
                  People from All Walks of Life in the Chinese Capital Supporting Egypt's Resistance Against Anglo-French Aggression Conference
