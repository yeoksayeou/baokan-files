Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th. The entire workforce of the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory is earnestly resolving the difficulties of insufficient raw materials, and this year's production plan is expected to be completed ahead of schedule.

　　The Shenyang Air Compressor Factory is currently the only factory in the country specializing in the manufacture of various air compressors, and its products are supplied throughout the country. At the beginning of this year, the factory's employees formulated an advanced production plan amidst a new high tide of socialist industrial construction. However, the execution of this plan encountered great difficulties due to insufficient supply of steel materials. The workers considered how much the nation's mines and construction sites needed various air compressors. For the sake of the country and for themselves, they had to find a way to solve the raw material problem and complete this year's plan. Before liberation, this air compressor factory was originally an automobile repair shop, and there was scrap steel and iron everywhere left over from that time. Based on this situation, the workers launched a campaign to collect scrap steel and iron. They used their spare time to dig and excavate, and from the end of August to the present, they have collected more than 200 tons of scrap iron alone. They also learned the Jinan Machine Tool Factory's method of "recycling crushed iron filings" and used all of the more than 100 tons of crushed iron filings cut from the factory's machine tools as raw materials for casting.

　　In the production process, the workers, from top to bottom, were of one mind, advocating for both quality and economy, and trying every means to save raw materials. In the third quarter alone, the casting workshop saved more than 100 tons of cast iron, while the rejection rate of castings was reduced by 10% compared to the second quarter. It is estimated that the entire factory can save about 900 tons of pig iron by the end of the year, and can guarantee the good quality of various products. At the same time, the technicians in the design department, by finding a way to change the design of the original three-hundred-horsepower air compressor, which was driven by a belt, to a direct-drive air compressor, eliminated the need for iron wheels for transmission on the machine, saving more than two tons of pig iron stock for each compressor, and also saving a lot of electricity during use.

　　The workers paid special attention to proactively contacting fraternal factories and exchanging what they had for what they needed. Once, the leading cadres of this factory heard that the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory had surplus pig iron, so they took the initiative to send people to contact them, and as a result, they obtained more than 400 tons of pig iron. They also exchanged materials with other factories and mines, obtaining more than 80 tons of pig iron, which was used as reserve material for the first quarter of next year.

### 开源节流保证原材料供应  沈阳空气压缩机厂今年计划可提前完成

    开源节流保证原材料供应
    沈阳空气压缩机厂今年计划可提前完成
    新华社沈阳16日电　沈阳空气压缩机厂全体职工认真解决原材料不足的困难，今年生产计划预计可以提前完成。
    沈阳空气压缩机厂是目前全国专门制造各种空气压缩机的唯一的工厂，它的产品供应了全国各地。今年年初，这个厂的职工在社会主义工业建设新高涨中制定了先进的生产计划。但是因为钢铁材料供应不足，执行这个计划遇到了很大的困难。职工们考虑到，全国矿山，建筑工地多么需要各种空气压缩机呀，为了国家、也为了自己，一定要想办法解决原材料问题，完成今年的计划。这个空气压缩机工厂解放以前原是个汽车修配厂，那时留下的废钢破铁到处都是。根据这种情况，职工们就开展了搜集废钢铁的活动。他们利用工余时间，挖的挖，掘的掘，从8月底到现在，仅搜集到的废铁一项，就有两百多吨。他们还学习了济南机床厂“碎铁屑回用”的办法，把全厂机床上切削下来的一百多吨碎铁屑，全部用来作了铸造的原材料。
    在生产过程中，职工们更是上下一心，提倡又好、又省，想尽办法节约原材料。在第三季度内，仅铸工一个车间就节约了一百多吨铸铁，而铸件的废品率反比第二季度降低10％。全厂到年底约计能节约出生铁九百多吨，并且可以保证各种产品质量良好。同时，设计科的技术人员，由于设法把原来由皮带传动的三百匹马力空气压缩机的设计改成直连式的空气压缩机，省去了机器上传动用的铁轮，使每台压缩机不仅能够节省两吨多生铁荒料，而且在使用的时候还能节省不少电力。
    职工们特别注意主动地同兄弟工厂联系，互通有无。有一次，这个工厂的领导干部听说哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂有余存的生铁，就主动派人去联系，结果弄到了四百多吨生铁。他们还同其他厂矿互通有无，交换到了八十多吨生铁，作为明年第一季度的储备材料。
