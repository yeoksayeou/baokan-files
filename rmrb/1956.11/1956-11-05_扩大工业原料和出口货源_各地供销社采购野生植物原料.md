Expanding Industrial Raw Materials and Export Sources
Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Regions Purchase Wild Plant Materials

(Our report) Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have purchased two to three hundred kinds of wild plant materials, many of which are industrial raw materials and export goods currently needed by the country. For example, the *shan mian pi* (mountain cotton bark) and *menghua pi* (dream flower bark) from Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangxi and other places have slender, soft, and tough fibers, making them the main raw materials for manufacturing waxed paper. *Honggen* (red root), discovered in Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan and other places, contains about 30% tannin and is a good tanning extract material. Tanning extract made from *honggen*, or used to tan leather, is of good quality and costs less than imported goods. Acorns are widely distributed and produced in large quantities in China. They are a kind of wild fruit containing a large amount of starch. In addition to being used as afforestation seeds, experiments in Liaoning, Henan, Sichuan, and other places have shown that they can replace staple grains to brew alcohol and liquor, with an alcohol yield of over 40%-50%, and the quality of the liquor is also good. Acorns are also good feed. *Shan Cang Zi* (Litsea cubeba) is also widely distributed in the Jiangnan area of China and belongs to the Lauraceae woody plants. The outer skin contains volatile oil, which can be distilled into *Shan Cang Zi* oil, containing more than 70% citral, which is a high-grade edible flavoring oil, and can also be used to manufacture high-grade perfumes, which are in great demand in the domestic, especially the international market. Various other wild plant oil materials, such as *chunshu zi* (Ailanthus altissima seeds), *canger zi* (cocklebur seeds), and *yanhao zi* (Salicornia europaea seeds), are being actively purchased in various regions, and it is planned to increase the country's production of various wild plant oils by more than 10,000 tons.

In carrying out the procurement of wild plant materials, the supply and marketing cooperatives have obtained the support and assistance of relevant industrial departments, export departments, and scientific research departments, which has solved the difficulties in acquisition technology, product testing, and product utilization. For example, farmers and supply and marketing cooperatives in the western Hubei mountain area did not recognize *shan mian pi* and *menghua pi*. This spring, the Zhejiang Provincial Industrial Department Paper Company sent five technicians to western Hubei to help the supply and marketing cooperatives carry out procurement. As a result, it was discovered that this kind of plant grows on the mountains of various counties.

In developing wild plant materials, in order to enable the vast number of farmers to recognize varieties and master collection and production techniques, the supply and marketing cooperatives have also adopted methods such as collecting plant specimens, formulating product samples, and organizing exhibitions to widely carry out publicity work. In order to ensure the normal production and supply of certain woody plant materials, attention has also been paid in procurement to educating farmers to closely integrate collection and cultivation in order to prevent the phenomenon of only collecting without cultivating.

Currently, it is the procurement season for most wild plant materials, and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are actively carrying out procurement, and paying attention to focusing on summarizing existing experiences to create conditions for large-scale procurement and utilization of wild plant materials in the future.

    扩大工业原料和出口货源
    各地供销社采购野生植物原料
    本报讯　各地供销合作社收购了二、三百种野生植物原料，其中很多是当前国家需要的工业原料和出口货源。例如，湖北、湖南、四川、江西等地的山棉皮和梦花皮具有细长、柔软、坚韧的纤维质，是制造皮腊纸的主要原料。湖北、湖南、四川等地发现的红根，含单宁在30％左右，是一种良好的拷胶原料，用红根制成的拷胶或用以鞣制皮革，质量很好，而成本较进口货低。橡子在我国分布广，产量大，是一种含有大量淀粉的野生果实，除作造林种子外，在辽宁、河南、四川等地试验，可代替主粮酿造酒精和饮酒，出酒率在40％—50％以上，酒的质量也好；橡子还是良好的饲料。山苍子在我国江南地区分布也很广，属樟科木本植物，外皮含有挥发性油，可蒸馏为山苍子油，含柠檬醛70％以上，是一种高级食用香料油，也可以制造高级香精，在国内、特别是国际市场上需要量很大。关于其他各种野生植物油料，如椿树子，苍耳子、盐蒿子等各地正在积极开展采购，计划可为国家增加多种野生植物油脂一万吨以上。
    供销合作社在开展野生植物原料的采购工作中，取得了有关工业部门、出口部门和科学研究部门的支持和协助，解决了收购技术，产品化验和产品利用中的困难。如鄂西山区的农民和供销社都不认识山棉皮和梦花皮，今春浙江省工业厅造纸公司派了五个技术人员，到鄂西帮助供销社开展收购，结果发现各县山上都生长这种植物。
    在开展野生植物原料中，为了使广大农民认识品种和掌握采集和生产技术，供销合作社还采取采集植物标本、制定产品样品、组织览展等方式，广泛地进行了宣传工作。为了保证某些木本植物原料的正常生产和供应，在采购中还注意了教育农民将采集与培植密切结合起来，以防止只采集不培植的现象。
    目前正是大部分野生植物原料的采购季节，各地供销合作社正积极地开展收购，并注意有重点地总结现有的经验，为今后大量采购和利用野生植物原料创造条件。　（西生）
