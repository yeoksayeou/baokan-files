Albania on the Move

Today is the 12th anniversary of Albania's liberation. Over the past twelve years, under the leadership of the Party, the Albanian people have made great achievements in economic and cultural construction and are currently striving to fulfill the second five-year plan for developing the national economy.

Achievements of the Past Twelve Years

Albania has adopted a series of measures to achieve socialist industrialization. In the past twelve years, Albania has renovated, expanded, and newly built many factories. In 1955 (the last year of the first five-year plan), the total industrial output increased by tenfold and a half compared with the pre-war year of 1938. The socialist component has taken an overwhelming advantage in industry. Albania has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an industrial and agricultural country.

In agriculture, agricultural production and the cooperative movement have developed. Due to the enormous work of draining marshlands, large areas of swamp have been turned into fertile fields. The country's arable land area has expanded by 70% compared to 1938. The expansion of arable land and the improvement of cultivation methods have significantly increased agricultural output. From 1950 to 1955, annual grain production increased by 67%. At the same time, agriculture has embarked on the road of socialist development. In 1946, Albania had only six agricultural production cooperatives, but now it has developed to seven hundred and twenty-eight; plus two hundred and eighty mutual aid teams, their land accounts for 31.5% of the country's total arable land. The socialist component in agriculture has been greatly consolidated.

On the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production, people's lives have also improved. Compared with 1955 and 1950, the real wages of workers have increased by 20%, and the income of farmers has increased by 35%. In the past twelve years, the development of cultural and educational undertakings has also made great achievements: illiteracy among people under the age of forty has been eliminated, and primary compulsory education has been implemented nationwide; seven-year compulsory education has been implemented in cities and some rural areas. Albania, which did not have even one higher education institution before liberation, now has six. Before liberation, there were only eight nurseries in the country; now, almost every institution and enterprise has one.

A Bright Future

The successive implementation of the two-year plan of 1949-1950 and the five-year plan of 1951-1955 has provided the People's Republic of Albania with a foundation for further developing industry and agriculture and improving the material and cultural living standards of the people. The second five-year plan, which began this year, has opened up a brighter future for the Albanian people. The plan stipulates further development of industry, especially the mining industry, with an increase of 92% in industrial output within five years. By 1960, coal production will reach eighty-two times that of 1938.

The second five-year plan, in view of the fact that the slow development of agriculture in the past has hindered the rapid development of industry, particularly emphasizes the rapid development of agriculture on the basis of reorganizing agricultural production according to socialist principles. The plan stipulates that the cooperation of the plains areas should be completed by 1960, and the cooperative arable land area will account for 70% of the country's total arable land. The total arable land area will be 19% larger than in 1955. Grain production will reach 146% of 1955 and 243% of 1938. It is expected that by the end of the second five-year plan, Albania's agricultural production will guarantee the supply of grain and technical crops needed by the country.

Within five years, the real wages of workers and staff will increase by 25%. At the same time, with the growth of production, the prices of daily necessities will continue to decrease, and the supply of industrial products and food per capita will greatly increase. In order to further improve living conditions, the area of new houses built during the second five-year plan will increase by 47% compared with the first five-year plan. The recently announced decision to reduce retail prices of industrial products and grain from November 26 this year, and the decision to increase the wages of low-paid employees by 41.4% from next year, are important steps taken by the Albanian Labor Party and the government to improve the people's living standards during the second five-year plan.

    前进中的阿尔巴尼亚
    今天是阿尔巴尼亚解放十二周年纪念日。十二年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在党的领导下，已在经济和文化建设方面取得了很大成就，目前正在为实现发展国民经济的第二个五年计划而奋斗。
    解放十二年来的成就
    阿尔巴尼亚在实现社会主义工业化方面采取了一系列措施。在过去的十二年内，阿尔巴尼亚改建、扩建和新建了许多工厂。1955年
  （第一个五年计划的最后一年），工业总产量比战前1938年增加了十倍半。社会主义成分在工业中已占压倒优势。阿尔巴尼亚已经从一个落后的农业国变成了一个工农业国家。
    农业方面，农业生产和合作化事业都有了发展。由于进行了排干沼泽地的巨大工作，大片泥塘变成了良田。全国耕地面积比1938年扩大了70％。耕地面积的扩大和耕作方法的改进，使农业产量有了显著的提高。从1950年到1955年，粮食的年产量增加了67％。同时，农业也走上了社会主义发展的道路。阿尔巴尼亚在1946年还只有六个农业生产合作社，而现在已经发展到七百二十八个；加上二百八十个互助组，它们的土地共占全国耕地面积的31.5％。农业中的社会主义成分大大地巩固了。
    在工农业生产发展的基础上，人民生活也得到了改善。以1955年和1950年相比，工人的实际工资增加了20％，农民收入增加了35％。十二年来，文化教育事业的发展也取得了巨大的成就：扫清了四十岁以下的文盲，全国实行了初等义务教育，城市和有些乡村实行了七年制义务教育。解放前连一所高等学校都没有的阿尔巴尼亚，现在有六所高等院校。解放前全国只有八个托儿所，现在几乎每个机关、企业都有。
    光辉的前景
    1949—1950年的两年计划和1951—1955年的五年计划的相继实现，使阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国具备了进一步发展工农业、提高人民物质和文化生活水平的基础。从今年开始实行的第二个五年计划，为阿尔巴尼亚人民开辟了更加光辉的前景。计划规定进一步发展工业，特别是采矿业，在五年内使工业产量增加92％。到1960年，煤的产量将达到1938年的八十二倍。
    第二个五年计划鉴于过去农业发展的迟缓阻碍了工业的迅速发展，特别强调在根据社会主义原则改组农业生产的基础上迅速发展农业。计划规定到1960年应完成平原地区的合作化，合作化的耕地面积将占全国耕地面积的70％。整个耕地面积将比1955年扩大19％。粮食产量将达到1955年的146％，1938年的243％。预计到第二个五年计划结束时，阿尔巴尼亚的农业生产将保证供应本国所需要的粮食和技术作物。
    五年内，工人和职员的实际工资将增加25％。同时，随着增产的生长，将不断降低日用品价格，并大大增加按人口计算的工业品和食品的供给量。为了进一步改善居住条件，第二个五年计划期间新建房屋的面积将比第一个五年计划增加47％。最近公布的关于自今年11月26日降低工业品和粮食零售价格的决定，以及规定从明年起把低薪职工工资提高41.4％的决定，就是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府在第二个五年计划期间提高人民生活水平的重要步骤之一。　（麋）（附图片）
