Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Li Zhuchen, Deputy Director of the China Democratic National Construction Association (MNDCA), stated at the Second Plenary Session of the First Central Committee of the MNDCA on the 5th that the MNDCA should further strengthen unity in the future and strive to assist the state in thoroughly completing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

Li Zhuchen made this statement while delivering a work report on behalf of the Standing Committee of the MNDCA Central Committee. In his report, Li Zhuchen pointed out that since the First Plenary Session of the First Central Committee of the MNDCA, the domestic political situation has undergone fundamental changes, the socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory nationwide, and capitalist industry and commerce nationwide have basically implemented overall public-private partnership, with fixed interest rates implemented in these joint ventures, fundamentally changing the social status and working relationships of capitalist industrialists and merchants.

The report stated that the MNDCA's work has made significant progress in the past year. During the upsurge of overall public-private partnership, under the leadership of the Party and the government, MNDCA organizations at all levels and all members participated in the various tasks of joint operation with great enthusiasm. Subsequently, they assisted the government in doing a good job in asset verification, personnel arrangements, and economic restructuring. It is worth mentioning that after the overall public-private partnership, many local MNDCA organizations promptly encouraged and promoted members to actively participate in socialist emulation drives. Many members have joined the glorious ranks of advanced producers and advanced workers. They not only contributed their talents and improved their ideological understanding and political awareness in the competition but also gained the respect of employees and improved the cooperative relationship between the public and private sectors.

Over the past year, the MNDCA's organization has grown significantly and has been consolidated and improved to a certain extent. Compared with the First Plenary Session of the First Central Committee of the MNDCA, the total number of members has increased by 1.7 times, and the number of organizational units has also increased by nearly one time.

Li Zhuchen then discussed the shortcomings and problems existing in the MNDCA's work in cultivating and educating its members and representing the legitimate interests of the industrial and commercial sectors. The report stated that these shortcomings and problems are primarily due to the MNDCA Central Committee Standing Committee having unrealistic phenomena in political and ideological leadership, as well as serious bureaucratic work styles in routine work, and the principle of collective leadership of the Central Committee has not been well implemented, and there is a lack of an atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism.

Li Zhuchen emphasized in his report that the work of the past year has shown that the MNDCA's previously established working principles and central tasks of cultivating and improving its industrial and commercial members to become backbone members of the industrial and commercial sectors are correct. Developing progressive core forces in the industrial and commercial sectors, continuously expanding the ranks of backbone members, and playing a backbone leading role is one of the main experiences of the basic victory of the socialist transformation of China's national bourgeoisie. In the future, the MNDCA must, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, adhere to this working principle and central task in accordance with the needs of the country's complete socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

Li Zhuchen said that in the past year, the MNDCA has gained some experience in how to do a good job in cultivating and improving industrial and commercial members, especially:

First, a comprehensive and correct analysis should be made of the dual nature of China's national bourgeoisie, and based on the new situation after the overall public-private partnership, an educational policy of criticism, encouragement, and emphasis on encouragement should be adhered to. Although the relations of production have undergone fundamental changes after the overall public-private partnership, fixed interest rates still exist, the capitalist ownership of the means of production has not been finally eliminated, and ideological transformation lags behind the development of the objective situation, so the dual nature of the bourgeoisie still exists. Some people believe that the dual nature of China's national bourgeoisie "no longer exists" or "should not be mentioned," thus ignoring the aspect that should continue to accept socialist transformation, which is wrong. At the same time, since the positive aspect of China's national bourgeoisie now occupies a dominant position, we should pay special attention to giving play to this positive role. In the work of cultivating and educating members, we should adhere to the educational policy of encouragement, criticism, and emphasis on encouragement, so as to fully develop any positive role, and ensure that wrong thoughts and actions can be educated and corrected in a timely manner through criticism.

Second, enterprises must be used as a base for cultivating and improving industrial and commercial members; and encouraging and promoting industrial and commercial members to actively participate in socialist emulation drives must be regarded as the central link in cultivating and improving members and giving play to their backbone role.

Third, members should be encouraged and educated to dare to represent the legitimate interests of the industrial and commercial sectors; and to fully exert the supervisory role of democratic parties and their members in national affairs.

Fourth, organize and mobilize industrial and commercial members to participate in various political theory studies in the industrial and commercial sectors and continuously improve their patriotism and socialist ideological awareness. The report also discussed some other aspects of experience.

Li Zhuchen said at the end of his report that the China Democratic National Construction Association, as a democratic party that unites and educates the national bourgeoisie of China, has become a democratic party that serves socialism more clearly in terms of understanding and practice. Our tasks are even greater. Let us unite, and strive vigorously to assist the state in thoroughly completing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, and build the motherland into a great socialist country.

### 中国民主建国会副主任委员  李烛尘在民建一届二中全会上作工作报告

    中国民主建国会副主任委员
    李烛尘在民建一届二中全会上作工作报告
    新华社7日讯　中国民主建国会副主任委员李烛尘5日在民建第一届中央委员会第二次全体会议上说，中国民主建国会今后要进一步加强团结，为协助国家彻底完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造而奋斗。
    李烛尘是代表民建中央常务委员会作工作报告时说的。李烛尘在报告中指出，从民建第一届中央委员会第一次全体会议以来的一年多时间里，国内政治形势已经起了根本的变化，社会主义革命已经在全国范围内取得了决定性的胜利，全国资本主义工商业已经基本上实行了全行业的公私合营，在这些公私合营企业中实行了定息的办法，资本主义工商业者的社会地位和工作关系已经起了根本性的变化。
    报告说，民建在这一年多时间内的工作有了巨大的进展。在全行业公私合营高潮到来的时候，在党和政府领导下，民建各级组织和全体会员都以巨大的热情参加了合营的各项工作。接着，又协助政府做好清产核资、人事安排和经济改组等工作。值得提出的是，在全行业公私合营以后，民建的不少地方组织都及时鼓励和推动会员积极参加了社会主义竞赛。许多会员走进了先进生产者和先进工作者的光荣行列。他们不但在竞赛中贡献了自己的才能，提高了思想认识和政治觉悟，而且得到了职工的重视，改进了公私双方合作共事关系。
    一年多来，民建的组织有了很大的发展，并且有了一定的巩固和提高，和民建一届一中全会时相比，现在的会员总数已增加了一·七倍，组织单位也增加了将近一倍。
    李烛尘在报告中接着谈到了民建在对会员的培养教育工作和在代表工商界的合法利益等方面存在的缺点和问题。报告说，这些缺点和问题的存在，首先是由于民建中央常务委员会在政治思想领导方面有不切实际的现象，同时在经常工作方面有严重的官僚主义作风，中央的集体领导原则也没有很好的贯彻，缺乏批评与自我批评的空气。
    李烛尘在报告中强调指出，一年多来的工作表明，民建过去规定的培养、提高本会工商业者会员成为工商界中的骨干分子的工作方针和中心任务是正确的。在工商界中发展进步核心力量，不断地扩大骨干分子的队伍，起骨干带头作用，是我国民族资产阶级进行社会主义改造取得基本胜利的主要经验之一。民建今后一定要在中国共产党的领导下，按照国家对资本主义工商业彻底完成社会主义改造的需要，坚持这一工作方针和中心任务的进一步贯彻。
    李烛尘说，过去一年多工作中，民建对于怎样做好培养和提高工商业者会员的工作，取得了一些经验，其中特别是：
    第一、应当对中国民族资产阶级的两面性做全面的、正确的分析，根据全行业公私合营以后的新情况，坚持有批评、有鼓励、以鼓励为主的教育方针。在全行业公私合营以后，虽然生产关系起了根本的变化，但是，定息还存在，生产资料的资本主义所有制还没有最后消灭，而且思想改造还落后于客观形势的发展，因此资产阶级的两面性还是存在的。有人认为中国民族资产阶级的两面性“已经没有了”，或者“不应该提了”，因而忽视了应当继续接受社会主义改造的一面，这是错误的。同时，由于目前中国民族资产阶级分子积极的一面已占主要的地位，我们就应该特别重视发挥积极作用这一方面，在对会员的培养教育工作中，也就应当坚持有鼓励、有批评、以鼓励为主的教育方针，以利于任何一点积极作用都得到充分发挥，而使错误的思想、行动也能通过批评得到及时的教育和纠正。
    第二、必须以企业作为培养和提高工商业者会员的基地；把鼓励和推动工商业者会员积极参加社会主义竞赛，当作培养和提高会员、发挥骨干作用的中心环节。
    第三、要鼓励和教育会员，敢于代表工商界的合法利益；并且充分发挥民主党派及其成员在国家事务中的监督作用。
    第四、组织和动员工商业者会员，参加工商界的各种政治理论学习，不断提高爱国主义和社会主义思想觉悟。报告中还谈到了一些其他方面的经验。
    李烛尘在报告的最后说，中国民主建国会作为一个团结、教育中国民族资产阶级分子的民主党派，已经成为一个在认识上和实践上都更为明确地为社会主义服务的民主党派了。我们的任务是更加重大了。让我们团结起来，生气勃勃地为协助国家彻底完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，为把祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而努力奋斗。
