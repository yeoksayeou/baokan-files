Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The All-China Sports Federation replied on the 7th to Mr. Rie, Honorary Secretary of the International Lawn Tennis Federation, deciding to send a delegation to participate in the 1957 Davis Cup Pacific Zone Tournament.

Not long ago, Mr. Rie sent a copy of his letter to the Australian Lawn Tennis Association to the All-China Sports Federation. In this letter, Mr. Rie wrote that he had received a letter from the so-called "China National Tennis Association" in Taiwan requesting to participate in the 1957 Davis Cup Pacific Zone Tournament and requesting to join the International Lawn Tennis Federation as a member.

Mr. Rie wrote: "I understand that since 1953, the All-China Sports Federation has been recognized as the organization governing lawn tennis in China, and they have paid membership dues and received all correspondence from the International Tennis Federation. At the International Tennis Federation Congress held on July 11, 1956, the All-China Sports Federation sent two representatives to represent China. Therefore, undoubtedly the China National Tennis Association does not have the formal qualifications, so it cannot send a team to participate in the Davis Cup competition."

    1957年台维斯杯太平洋区域网球赛
    我国决定派代表队参加
    新华社8日讯　中华全国体育总会7日复函给国际草地网球联合会名誉秘书里艾，决定派代表队参加1957年台维斯杯赛的太平洋区域赛。
    里艾不久以前，把他致澳大利亚草地网球协会的信的抄件，寄给中华全国体育总会。里艾在这封信里写道，他已经收到台湾的所谓“中华全国网球协会”要求参加1957年台维斯杯赛太平洋区域赛和要求加入国际草地网球联合会为会员的信。
    里艾写道：“我了解到，自从1953年中华全国体育总会就已被承认为在中国管辖草地网球运动的机构，他们已经缴了会费，并且收到所有国际网球联合会寄出的函件。在1956年7月11日召开的国际网球联合会代表大会上，中华全国体育总会派了两个代表出席代表中国。因此，无疑地中华全国网球协会没有正式的资格，所以它不能派队参加台维斯杯比赛。”
