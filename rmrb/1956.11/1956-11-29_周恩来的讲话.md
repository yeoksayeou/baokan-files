Zhou Enlai's Speech
Dear Prime Minister Nehru, Dear Friends:

I am very pleased to be invited once again to visit our great neighbor, the Republic of India. I bring to the people of India the brotherly greetings of the Chinese people.

Since my first visit to India two and a half years ago, the friendship between our two nations has been further strengthened on the basis of the Five Principles – Panchsheel. Today, we meet again as old friends, and the joyous mood we express fully embodies the close and great friendship that currently exists between the people of our two countries.

In the past two years or more, while our two peoples have been engaged in their respective constructions, they have increasingly expanded our two countries' economic cooperation and cultural exchange. During this visit, we will see your construction achievements and learn from you.

Our two countries' cooperation in international affairs has also become closer. As the countries that first proposed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the friendship and cooperation between India and China are of particular importance in promoting world peace and international cooperation. I sincerely hope that through this visit, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries will be further consolidated and developed. I equally hope that through the contact between leaders of our two countries, we will be able to further work together for the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

Thank you for giving us such a grand and warm welcome.

Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Indian people!

Long live peace in Asia and the world!

    周恩来的讲话亲爱的尼赫鲁总理阁下、亲爱的朋友们：
    我能够再一次应邀访问我们的伟大邻邦印度共和国，感到十分高兴。我为印度人民带来了中国人民兄弟般的问候。
    自从两年半以前我第一次访问印度以后，我们两国之间的友谊已经在五项原则——潘查希拉——的基础上进一步加强了。今天我们作为老朋友重新相会，我们表现的愉快心情，充分体现出目前存在于我们两国人民之间亲密而伟大的友谊。
    两年多以来，我们两国人民在各自进行建设的同时，日益开展了我们两国之间的经济合作和文化交流。我们将在这次访问期间看到你们建设的成就，并向你们学习。
    我们两国在国际事务中的合作也已经更加紧密。作为首先倡议和平共处五项原则的国家，印度和中国之间的友谊和合作，对于促进世界和平和国际合作，具有特别重要的意义。我衷心地希望通过我们这次的访问，我们两国之间的友好合作关系将更加巩固和发展。我同样地希望，通过我们两国领导人员的接触，我们两国将能进一步为亚洲和世界和平的事业而共同努力。
    感谢你们给予我们这样盛大、热烈的欢迎。
    中印两国人民之间永恒的友谊万岁！
    亚洲和世界的和平万岁！
