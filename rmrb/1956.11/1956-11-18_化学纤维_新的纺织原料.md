Chemical Fibers – A New Textile Raw Material
    Sun Junli

    There are many chemical fiber products on the domestic market and in the recent Japanese commodity exhibition in Beijing, such as socks, tablecloths, raincoats, clothing fabrics, etc., which are very popular.

    Chemical fibers, also known as artificial fibers, are made from wood, waste cotton, cotton linter, reeds, bamboo, wheat straw, coal, water, lime, and other materials.

    Chemical fibers can be divided into two major categories: modified fibers and synthetic fibers, with each category further divided into several types. Chemical fibers have properties such as elasticity, insect resistance, stain resistance, easy washing, and no need for ironing, all of which surpass natural fibers. The heat resistance, softness, and moisture absorption of chemical fibers also exceed those of cotton, wool, and silk fabrics. Their warmth retention is second only to wool, and after dyeing, the colors are bright and dazzling.

    Chemical fibers are not only suitable for manufacturing high-grade fabrics, but also for manufacturing tire cord fabrics, filter cloths, conveyor belts, electrical insulation wires, ship cables, fishing nets, ropes, work clothes, medical sutures, etc. A car tire made of viscose fiber cord fabric can travel 50,000 to 100,000 kilometers, while a car tire made of cotton cord fabric can only travel 25,000 to 60,000 kilometers.

    The level of our country's textile industry is very low. In terms of the average amount of textiles allocated per person per year, Japan currently has seven kilograms, Czechoslovakia has eight point one kilograms, the United Kingdom has twelve point four kilograms, and the United States has nineteen point one kilograms, while our country has less than two kilograms. If we raise our country's level to ten kilograms, then we must have six million tons of textile raw materials every year, while the current national textile raw materials are only one point five to one point six million tons. Relying solely on increasing natural textile raw materials is not feasible, because the production of cotton and wool requires vast amounts of land, which conflicts with increasing grain production. Developing chemical fibers will not have this conflict. For example, each spruce tree (averaging three cubic meters) can produce 660 kilograms of textile fiber, and it occupies only ten square meters of land. This 660 kilograms of fiber is equivalent to one point five hectares of cotton or four point four hectares of hemp. Other raw materials such as coal, water, air, lime, etc., do not occupy farmland at all. Therefore, developing chemical fibers is the direction for our country to open up new textile raw materials in the future.

    Currently, our country is planning to build and restore its own chemical fiber factories. In the near future, chemical fiber products made from domestically produced raw materials will be available on the Chinese market.

    化学纤维——新的纺织原料
    孙君立
    在国内市场上和最近在北京展出的日本商品展览会上，有不少化学纤维制品，如袜子、台布、雨衣、衣料等，都很受人欢迎。
    化学纤维，也叫人造纤维，是利用木材、废棉、棉短绒、芦苇和竹、麦秸、煤、水、石灰等制成。
    化学纤维可分改造纤维和合成纤维两大类，每一类又分好几种。化学纤维具有伸缩性，耐虫蛀，不易沾污，容易洗涤，无需烫熨，这些性能都超过天然纤维。化学纤维的耐热、柔软，吸湿等性能，也超过棉、毛、丝织品，保暖性仅次于羊毛，而且染色后，色泽鲜艳夺目。
    化学纤维不仅适于制造高级织物，而且适于制造轮胎帘子布，过滤布，运输带，电绝缘线，船缆，鱼网，绳索，工作服，医疗用缝合线等等。一个用粘胶纤维帘子布制成的汽车轮胎，可以行驶五万到十万公里，而用棉线帘子布制成的汽车轮胎只能走二万五、六千公里。
    我国纺织工业水平是很低的。以每人平均每年分得的纺织品来说，目前日本是七公斤，捷克斯洛伐克是八点一公斤，英国是十二点四公斤，美国是十九点一公斤，我国还不到二公斤。如果把我国的水平提高到十公斤，那末每年必须有六百万吨纺织原料，而目前全国的纺织原料只有一百五、六十万吨。如果仅仅依靠增加天然纺织原料是不行的，因为生产棉花、羊毛，需要广大的土地，这跟增产粮食有矛盾。发展化学纤维就不会有这种矛盾。例如每一株云杉（平均以三立方公尺计算）可以制造六百六十公斤纺织纤维，它所占土地面积，只不过十平方公尺，这六百六十公斤纤维，相当于一点五公顷的棉花，或者四点四公顷的麻。其它原料如煤、水、空气、石灰等等，根本不占农作物的土地。由此可见，发展化学纤维，是今后我国开辟新纺织原料的方向。
    现在，我国正在筹建和恢复自己的化学纤维工厂。不久的将来，在我国市场上，就可以买到用国产原料制造的化学纤维制品了。
