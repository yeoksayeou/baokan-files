International Notes

    Simple-Minded
    The commander of the invading Egyptian forces, General Keightley, commander of the Anglo-French Allied Forces in the Mediterranean, publicly threatened Egypt on November 1, saying that Egypt could only reduce "loss of life and property" if it accepted "international control of the canal area." This decorated pirate chief shamelessly boasted: "We have the power to inflict very heavy blows."
    Compared to the white-gloved Eden and his ilk, Keightley, who carries a gun, is obviously more simple-minded. Keightley's simple-mindedness is evident in two areas: First, he believes that with the military power of Britain and France, he can inflict "heavy blows" on Egypt, which has only recently become independent. This man, who lives by aggression, only sees the weapons, but not the people who wield them. However, Britain also "has the power" in Malaya and Kenya, so why can't it conquer the people there? This point obviously didn't flash through Keightley's mind. Second, Eden and his ilk are still dreaming of using nonsense such as "freedom of navigation" and "peace in the Middle East" to cover up the Anglo-French aggression, while Keightley nakedly admits that Britain's killing and arson in Egypt is to achieve the so-called "international control" method of seizing the canal. In this way, the British general gave the British prime minister and diplomats a resounding slap in the face.

    脑筋简单
    侵埃军队的指挥者，地中海英法联军司令凯特莱在11月1日公开恫吓埃及说，埃及只有接受“国际管制运河地区的办法”，才可以减少“生命和财产的遭受损失”。这个挂肩章的海盗头子无耻地吹嘘道：“我们有力量来进行非常沉重的打击。”
    拿枪杆的凯特莱和戴白手套的艾登之流比较起来，显然是脑筋更简单一些。凯特莱的脑筋简单表现在两个地方：第一，他以为凭着英法两个大国的军事力量，就能给刚刚独立不久的埃及以“沉重的打击”。这个靠侵略吃饭的人只看到武器，却没有看到拿武器的人。可是，英国在马来亚、怯尼亚也是“有力量”的，为什么就不能征服那里的人民呢？凯特莱的脑子里显然没有闪过这一点。第二，艾登之流还在梦想用什么为了“航行自由”、为了“中东和平”那类鬼话来为英法的侵略行为打掩护，而凯特莱却赤裸裸地供认英国到埃及杀人放火，就是为了要实现夺取运河的所谓“国际管制”办法。这样，英国的将军就给英国的首相和外交官吃了一记清脆的耳光。
