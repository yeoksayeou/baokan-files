    After the Opening of the Free Market
    Wuhan’s Fresh Fish Supply Increases; Yidu County’s Dried and Fresh Fruits Sell Well
    (Our newspaper dispatch) After the opening of the Wuhan Municipal Aquatic Products Free Market, the market has become active. The variety of aquatic products on the market has increased, and the supply of fresh and live food has increased by 50,000 jin compared to the past. In the past, small vendors in Wuhan "waited for customers to come to their door" and relied solely on state-owned companies for supplies. Now they have organized their own purchasing power and gone deep into the production areas for free procurement. To facilitate consumers, they have set up fixed or mobile aquatic product stalls in the streets and alleys, and some even provide services such as gutting and processing, proactively delivering fish to people's doors. At the same time, the quality of aquatic products has improved since the market implemented pricing based on quality grades.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 27th: Mountainous areas in the southwest of Yidu County, Shandong Province, are rich in dried and fresh fruits. In the past, the county's supply and marketing cooperative dared not handle them for fear of spoilage, so the sales of various fresh fruits were very poor. Since the opening of the free market under state leadership in early November, merchants from various places have come to the production areas to purchase. Even the Huang pears, which had never left the county before, have been transported and sold to Tianjin, Jinan, and other places. The soft jujubes produced locally used to have no market at all, and farmers had no choice but to let them rot on the trees. Recently, purchasing agents from Dalian purchased 200,000 jin. This year's persimmons have had a bumper harvest, and are very cheap locally, selling for only two fen per jin. Now, due to foreign purchases, they can sell for three or four fen per jin. Allowing farmers to trade and negotiate prices independently has changed the unreasonable prices of some minor local products in the past. For example, the price of wild jujubes, which can be used as medicinal materials, has also increased compared to the past.
    Now, the supply and sales volume of dried and fresh fruits in this county have increased greatly. More than 10,000 jin of walnuts, hawthorns, and hawthorn slices are now transported from Yidu Station every day. The trust warehouse recently opened by the Yidu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has purchased 300,000 jin of dried persimmons on behalf of foreign merchants.

    开放自由市场以后
    武汉鲜鱼上市量增加  益都县的干鲜果畅销
    本报讯　武汉市水产自由市场开放后，市场显得活跃起来。上市的水产品种花色增多，鲜活食品上市量比过去增加五万斤。武汉市的小商小贩过去“等客上门”，单纯依靠国营公司进货；现在他们组织了自己的采购力量，深入到产区自由采购。他们为了方便消费者，在大街小巷都设有固定或流动的水产摊贩，有的还代客剖制加工，主动地把鱼送上门。同时，市场上实行了按质分等论价以后水产的质量有了提高。

    据新华社济南27日电　山东省益都县西南部的山区盛产干鲜果，过去这个县的供销社因怕腐烂不敢经营，因此各种鲜果的销路都很不好。从11月初开放国家领导下的自由市场后，各地客商前来产地采购，连从未出过县的黄梨也运销到天津、济南等地。当地出产的软枣过去根本没有销路，农民只好让它烂在树上，最近大连的采购员采购了二十万斤。今年柿子普遍丰收，在当地很不值钱，每斤只能卖两分钱，现在由于外商采购，每斤已可卖到三、四分钱。由于允许农民贸易自行议价，改变了过去一些小土产价格不合理的现象。如可以做药材用的酸枣，价格也比过去有所提高。
    现在，这个县干鲜果的上市量和销售量已大大增加。现在每天由益都车站运出的核桃、山楂、楂片有一万多斤。益都县供销合作社新近开设的信托货栈，代外地客商采购的柿饼就有三十万斤。
