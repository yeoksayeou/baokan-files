    “Telling the Leaders to Start Fires”
    Ma Bian
    A group of translators were transferred to a certain factory, but they had nothing to do for months on end. Everyone was bored and repeatedly suggested to the leaders that they needed work, but there was no response. As a result, everyone was full of complaints and referred to each other as “retirees.”
    Presumably, the leaders felt it was necessary to give these translators some education. The head of the Cadre Section personally convened a meeting. At the meeting, he said with great conviction: “...Firefighters don't often have work to do either, do they? If they also complained about needing work, wouldn't that be the same as telling the leaders to start fires?”
    Good heavens! It's rare that the head of the Cadre Section could come up with such a brilliant analogy! Wanting work "is the same as telling the leaders to start fires," what a bizarre logic!

    “叫领导去放火”
    马鞭
    一批翻译人员调到某厂，一连几个月没事做。大家闲得发慌，屡次向领导提意见要求工作，也没反应。于是大家牢骚满腹，见面互称
  “休养员”。
    大概领导认为有对这些翻译人员进行一次教育的必要了。干部科长便亲自召集了一次会议。在会上他振振有词地说：“……消防队员不是也常没有工作吗？如果他们也提意见要工作，这不是等于叫领导去放火吗？”
    我的天！难得干部科长想出了这一个绝妙的譬喻！要工作，“等于叫领导去放火”，多么奇特的逻辑！
