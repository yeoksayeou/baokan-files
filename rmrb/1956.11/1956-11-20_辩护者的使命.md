The "New York Times" was quick to defend the invaders as soon as Britain, France, and Israel launched their invasion of Egypt, exposing the hypocrisy of the United States' opposition to the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt.

The newspaper's editorial on November 1 stated that "in the sense that aggression means a military attack across another country's borders, Israel, Britain, and France should be considered aggressors." However, it went on to argue that "the problem is not that simple," and astonishingly asserted: "On the contrary, if anyone has committed the crime of aggression, it is none other than the President of Egypt." What was the reason? The "New York Times" listed many of Egypt's crimes, one of the greatest being Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, which it claimed was tantamount to "waging war against Israel, Britain, and France."

In the United States, there are various people who defend the Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of Egypt, but few have dared to distort the facts as blatantly as the "New York Times."

A few days later, the "New York Times" published a letter from a reader who was by no means a supporter of Egypt, but expressed "incomprehension" of the "reasoning" of the "New York Times." He wrote: "This editorial demonstrates a contradictory position on the definition of 'aggression.' On the one hand, you find it difficult to use it to describe the actions of Israel, France, and Britain, while on the other hand, you do not hesitate to apply it to Nasser."

As a mouthpiece for the State Department, the "New York Times" does not care about these things when it shows itself to be a mortal enemy of the Egyptian people.

The "New York Times" bears a special mission. It openly calls for "relying on the alliance that maintains the free world" to "deal with Nasser" and to "deal with" the Soviet Union, whose prestige is growing due to its assistance to Egypt and the just struggle of the people of the Middle East. This is the true face of the United States' current encouragement of the Anglo-French-Israeli aggressors and standing with them.

However, while the "New York Times" acts as a defender of the Anglo-French-Israeli aggressors and calls for strengthening the "alliance," it does not harbor any good intentions towards Britain and France. The United States is using the banner of "alliance" to control Egypt and replace Britain and France in the Middle East. (Ya)

    辩护者的使命
    “纽约时报”早在英法以刚刚发动侵埃战争的时候，就忙着出来替侵略者辩护，暴露出美国反对英法以进攻埃及的虚伪面目。
    这家报纸11月1日的社论说：“从侵略是指越过别国边境实行军事进攻的意义来看，以色列、英国和法国应当是侵略者。”但是，接着它又认为，“问题并不是这样简单”，而且令人吃惊地断言：“恰恰相反，如果曾有某个人犯了侵略罪，那末这不是别人，正是埃及的总统。”理由何在？“纽约时报”列举了埃及许多罪名，其中一个大罪名是埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有，据说这就不啻是“同以色列、英国和法国进行了战争。”
    在美国，有各种各样的替英法以侵略埃及作辩护的人，但是还很少有人胆敢像“纽约时报”这样颠倒是非。
    过了几天，“纽约时报”刊出了一封读者来信，这位读者决不是埃及的支持者，但是他表示对“纽约时报”的“推理”“无法理解”。他写道：“这篇社论对于
  ‘侵略’这个字的定义，表现了前后矛盾的立场。一方面你们觉得难于用它来形容以色列、法国和英国的行动，另一方面你们却又毫不犹豫地把它加在纳赛尔身上。”
    作为国务院的喉舌的“纽约时报”，当它表明自己是埃及人民的死对头的时候，它是顾不得这些的。
    “纽约时报”担负着一种特殊的使命。它露骨地号召：“依靠维持自由世界的联盟”，“对付纳赛尔”，“对付”由于援助埃及和中东人民的正义斗争而日益提高威望的苏联。这正是美国目前怂恿英法以侵略者并同它们站在一起的真面目。
    但是，在“纽约时报”充当英法以侵略者的辩护人，叫喊加强“联盟”的时候，对英法也并不怀着什么善良的意图。美国是在打着“联盟”的旗帜，既想控制埃及，又要取代英法在中东的地位。（亚）
