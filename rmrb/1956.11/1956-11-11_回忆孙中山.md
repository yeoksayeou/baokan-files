    Remembering Sun Yat-sen
    Song Qingling
    Human history in the twentieth century is developing rapidly, presenting a new look. Especially China, which has suffered deeply, has ignited the sparks of revolution in the past half-century, constantly innovating, forging ahead, transforming from decay to new life, from darkness to light. A vibrant phenomenon has put an end to all that is old and obsolete. As we commemorate Sun Yat-sen's ninetieth birthday, let us recall that we have not only eliminated the imperialism and feudalism that Sun Yat-sen hated during his lifetime, and turned the democracy he pursued throughout his life from an ideal into reality; but also the socialism that Sun Yat-sen yearned for has also achieved a rapid and decisive victory in the past year through agricultural collectivization and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Even the "Industrial Plan" that he painstakingly devised has been concretely manifested in the Five-Year Plan. Soon, the first Five-Year Plan will be successfully completed, creating a better and happier tomorrow for the people of new China.
    These vivid realities have completely changed the face of our country. Although Sun Yat-sen could not personally witness the realization of his ideals, all these developments are the goals he strived for throughout his life. Because he was born into a poor peasant family, he suffered from the devastation of feudalism and imperialism. The awakening of the Chinese people after the Opium War and the failure of the Hundred Days' Reform made him realize that the path of reform and compromise would not work. Therefore, in 1905, in order to change the destiny of his country, he organized the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) and proposed to overthrow the Qing government. At that time, although limited by historical conditions, it only took the parliamentary systems of France and the United States as examples of revolution, and did not see the great power of the working class, but the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 finally declared the end of China's two thousand years of feudal monarchy.
    From the perspective of the essence of the parliamentary system, although it is more progressive than the feudal monarchy, it cannot solve the tasks of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. Therefore, Yuan Shikai restored the monarchy and made himself emperor. As soon as Sun Yat-sen heard this news, he rushed back to China from Japan and instigated the Second Revolution against Yuan. After Yuan Shikai died, the Northern Warlords, in order to maintain their feudal rule, abolished the parliamentary system again. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen rose up again to lead the Constitutional Protection Movement and fight against them, but in July 1918, he was squeezed out by the Southern Warlords and returned to Shanghai.
    Although Sun Yat-sen suffered one setback and failure after another in his revolutionary practice, he always adhered to the justice of patriotism in his unyielding struggle, and through practice, he humbly learned and constantly pursued progress. For example, when he retreated to Shanghai in a state of hesitation, he founded the "Construction Magazine" and "Weekly Review" to find the truth of the revolution, and finally found the truth of the revolution. Because the great victory of the October Revolution established a proletarian dictatorship in the world, pointing out a bright path for the whole world, and the outbreak of the May Fourth Movement also opened up a new situation for the revolution in China. In October 1920, Sun Yat-sen returned to Guangdong again to establish a revolutionary base with an unyielding revolutionary spirit, but had to return to Shanghai due to Chen Jiongming's rebellion.
    Although Sun Yat-sen suffered countless blows in the revolutionary struggle, the truth of the revolution finally emerged from the painful experience of failure. Therefore, in the declaration of the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, Sun Yat-sen mentioned: "Although the revolution is called successful... after a short time, it has been forced by the situation to compromise with the counter-revolutionary autocratic class. This kind of compromise is in fact indirectly harmonized with imperialism, and is the root cause of the first failure of the revolution." He also said: "Since the Xinhai Revolution and up to now, China's situation has not only made no progress, but has become increasingly worse. The tyranny of the warlords and the erosion of the great powers are becoming more and more serious, making China deeply mired in the hell of a semi-colony..." From this passage, we can understand how Sun Yat-sen learned from his failures and how much he hated the collusion between feudal warlords and imperialism. The turning point in Sun Yat-sen's thinking made him sincerely accept the assistance of the international working class and the Chinese working class, and thus put forward the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers. At this time, Sun Yat-sen reinterpreted the content of the Three Principles of the People, that is, nationalism takes anti-imperialism as the main content, democracy takes people's democracy as the main content, and people's livelihood takes land to the tiller as the main content. From then on, the revolutionary Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party formed an alliance against imperialism and feudalism, and launched a new revolutionary struggle, which made the Chinese revolution between 1924 and 1927 gain unprecedented development.
    Because Sun Yat-sen found the direction of the revolution from revolutionary practice and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, he pointed out that these three major policies are the only way to implement the Three Principles of the People. And take the Principle of People's Livelihood as the most basic issue of the revolution. This is to abandon bourgeois democracy in thought and begin to realize the importance of relying on the masses of workers and peasants. Therefore, when the Russian October Revolution broke out, he immediately sent a telegram to the Soviet government and Lenin to congratulate them on their success. He pointed out: "With the Russian revolution, a hope has emerged for the world's humanity." From this point, we can appreciate his disgust and despair for capitalism. After the October Revolution, the Soviet government immediately issued a declaration to China, declaring the abolition of the privileges acquired by the Russian imperial government in China. This friendly expression made Sun Yat-sen sincerely understand the great significance of the Soviet Union's friendship. He said: "We have established unequal treaties with many countries... We have become the subjugated slaves of more than a dozen countries. Recently, a new Russia has emerged, automatically abolishing all unequal treaties between China and Russia, returning the special rights obtained by Tsarist Russia in China, abandoning the position of master, not recognizing us as slaves, but recognizing us as friends." From then on, Sun Yat-sen deeply realized the correct path that the Chinese revolution "cannot succeed without taking Russia as a teacher" and humbly learned from the Soviet Union. At the same time, at the Second National Congress of the Kuomintang, he put forward the basic slogans of the first stage of the Chinese revolution, namely "Down with imperialism" and "Down with feudal warlords". In the early period of 1923, due to the development of the new revolutionary situation, Sun Yat-sen convened a meeting with representatives of the Communist Party and reorganized the Kuomintang, making it an organizational form of the revolutionary united front, laying the foundation for the Northern Expedition.
    Judging from Sun Yat-sen's forty years of revolutionary practice, his great transformation in his later years conformed to the demands of the Chinese people, so that the revolutionary Three Principles of the People and the minimum program of the Chinese Communist Party—New Democracy—reached a basic consensus on several principles. Because he felt that the road of capitalism was impassable. Therefore, in his will, he proposed, "We must awaken the masses and unite with the nations of the world that treat me equally to fight together."
    In the thirty-one years since his death, although the Chiang Kai-shek clique has engaged in activities that betrayed the motherland and harmed the people, the people of the whole country have realized a revolutionary truth, that is, the Chinese revolution must be led by the working class and its political party—the Chinese Communist Party—to achieve the goal of victory. Because Marxism-Leninism is a universal truth. It is invincible and unconquerable. The Chinese revolution has found this direction of progress, and has achieved unprecedented development, and its achievements in the two revolutionary stages have exceeded Sun Yat-sen's ideals.
    Thanks to Chairman Mao's correct leadership, the Chinese people have achieved revolutionary victory. Today, China's international status has been unprecedentedly improved and it has become an independent and democratic country. It has been in an important position in international affairs. We have formed an unbreakable friendship with the great socialist Soviet Union, and established brotherly friendship with the people's democratic countries. This great alliance and friendship has become an invincible force to defend the Far East and world peace. In terms of our motherland's production, unprecedented high growth has been achieved in a short period of seven years. The current peasants are not only at the level of land to the tiller, but are also embarking on the road of collectivization, and the lives of the vast number of peasants have been greatly improved through the improvement of labor production. At the same time, our industry and commerce are not only at the level of restricting capital, but are also embarking on the road of socialism. It has also achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of world peace, and shattered the conspiracy of war-mongering. For example, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence initiated by China and India have been recognized by Asia, Africa and many countries in the world. There are now twenty-eight countries that have established diplomatic relations with China, with a population of more than one billion.
    In a word, the great power of the people has promoted the wheel of history, and through the two stages of the New Democratic and Socialist revolutions, it has transformed semi-feudal and semi-colonial China into an independent and free socialist China, and has become a strong country on the international stage. In every corner, we can see a thriving new atmosphere, full of unlimited bright prospects. Not only has it turned Sun Yat-sen's lifelong ideals into reality, but it has also far exceeded his ideals. In the overall victory of the people's revolution, in memory of the revolutionary pioneers, we should appreciate his patriotic enthusiasm, his revolutionary perseverance, his determination to learn from the Soviet Union, his fighting spirit, and continue to fight for socialist construction and world peace under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    回忆孙中山
    宋庆龄
    二十世纪的人类历史在飞速地发展，呈现着新的面貌。特别是灾难深重的中国，在半世纪以来，燃着了革命的火花，不断地推陈出新、迈步前进；由腐朽到新生，由黑暗走向光明。一片生气蓬勃的现象，结束了古老陈旧的一切。当着纪念孙中山九十诞辰的时候，回忆一下，现在我们不仅消灭了孙中山生前所痛恨的帝国主义和封建主义，使他毕生所追求的民主主义由理想变为现实；就是孙中山所憧憬的社会主义，也在最近一年来，通过了农业合作化和资本主义工商业改造，迅速地取得了决定性的胜利。连过去他所悉心擘划的“实业计划”，也在五年计划中具体表现出来。不久，第一个五年计划即将胜利完成，替新中国人民创造美好幸福的明天。
    这些活生生的现实，使我们国家的面貌完全改变。孙中山虽然不可能亲眼看见他的理想实现，但这一切发展都是他毕生奋斗的目标。因为他出身是个贫农家里的贫儿，受尽了封建主义和帝国主义的摧残。在鸦片战争后中国人民的觉醒和戊戌政变的失败，使他认识到改良妥协的路是走不通的。因而在1905年为了改变自己国家的命运，组织革命同盟会，提出了推翻清朝政府。那时虽限于历史条件，只拿法国、美国的议会制度做革命的榜样，没有看到工人阶级的伟大力量，可是1911年的辛亥革命，终于宣告中国两千年封建帝制的结束。
    从议会制度的本质来说，虽比封建帝制较为进步，却不能解决反帝国主义和反封建主义的任务。因而当时袁世凯恢复了君主制度，自己做了皇帝。孙中山一听到这消息就从日本赶回国来，策动反袁的第二次革命。到袁世凯死了以后，北洋军阀为了维持他们的封建统治，又把议会制度取消了。因此，孙中山又起来领导了护法运动和他们进行斗争，但在1918年7月因遭受了南方军阀的排挤，回到上海。
    在孙中山的革命实践中虽遭到一次又一次的挫折和失败，但是他在不屈不挠中始终坚持爱国主义的正义，而且通过实践，虚心学习和不断地追求进步。例如他在徬徨的情绪中退居上海时，创办了“建设杂志”与“星期评论”，去寻找革命真理，最后终于将革命真理找到了。因为十月革命的伟大胜利，在世界上建立了一个无产阶级专政的国家，给全世界指出了一条光明的道路，同时“五四”运动的爆发也在中国开辟了革命的新局面。到了1920年10月，孙中山以不屈不挠的革命精神再度回到广东建立革命基地，但又因陈炯明叛变不得不回到上海。
    孙中山尽管在革命斗争中受到无数的打击，革命的真理终于在失败的痛苦经验中显现出来。所以在中国国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言中，孙中山提到：“革命虽号成功……曾几何时，已为情势所迫，不得已而与反革命的专制阶级谋妥协。此种妥协，实间接与帝国主义相调和，遂为革命第一次失败之根源。”他又说：“自辛亥革命以后，以迄于今，中国之情况，不但无进步可言，且有江河日下之势。军阀之专横，列强之侵蚀，日益加厉，令中国深入半殖民地之泥犁地狱……。”我们从这一段话可以体会孙中山如何从失败中吸取了经验，体会到他是怎样地痛恨封建军阀与帝国主义互相勾结。孙中山思想上的转折，使他真诚地接受了国际工人阶级和中国工人阶级的援助，从而提出了联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策。就在这个时候，孙中山重新解释了三民主义的内容，即民族主义以反帝国主义为主要内容，民权主义是以人民民主为主要内容，民生主义是以耕者有其田为主要内容。从此，革命的国民党与中国共产党结成了反帝国主义和反封建主义的联盟，展开了新的革命斗争，使在1924年至1927年间的中国革命获得空前的发展。
    由于孙中山从革命实践中和苏联的先进经验中找出了革命的方向，指出这三大政策是实行三民主义的唯一方法。而以民生主义为革命的最基本问题。这就是在思想上抛弃了资产阶级的民主，开始认识到依靠工农群众的重要性。所以当俄国十月革命爆发后，他立即致电苏维埃政府和列宁祝贺他们的成功。他指出：“有了俄国革命，世界人类便生出了一个希望。”我们从这点可以体会到他对资本主义的厌恶和绝望。十月革命之后，苏维埃政府立刻向中国发表宣言，声明取消俄罗斯帝国政府在中国取得的特权。这种友好的表示使孙中山衷心地了解苏联这种友谊的伟大意义。他说：“我们和许多国家立了不平等的条约，……做了十几个国家的亡国奴，最近新产生了一个俄国，自动的废除中俄一切不平等条约，交回帝俄在中国所得的特别权利，放弃主人的地位，不认我们是奴隶，认我们是朋友。”从此以后，孙中山深切体会到中国革命“非以俄为师断无成就”的正确道路，虚心地向苏联学习。同时在国民党第二次全国代表大会中提出了中国革命第一阶段的基本口号，即“打倒帝国主义”，和“打倒封建军阀”。在1923年初期，由于新的革命形势发展，孙中山召开了有共产党代表参加的会议和改组了国民党，使它成为革命统一战线的组织形式，给北伐战争奠定了基础。
    从孙中山四十年的革命实践看起来，他在晚年的伟大转变符合于中国人民的要求，使革命的三民主义同中国共产党的最低纲领——新民主主义在若干原则上达到基本上的一致。因为他感到资本主义的道路走不通了。所以在他的遗嘱里，提出，“必须唤起民众，及联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗。”
    他逝世三十一年来，蒋介石集团虽进行了叛卖祖国危害人民的勾当，但全国人民已认识到一条革命的真理，那就是中国革命必须由工人阶级及其政党——中国共产党的领导才能达到胜利的目的。因为马克思列宁主义是放诸四海而皆准的真理。它是战无不胜的，攻无不克的。中国革命找到这个前进方向，才获得空前的发展，在两个革命阶段中的成就超过了孙中山的理想。
    由于毛主席的正确领导，中国人民已取得了革命的胜利。今天中国的国际地位已经空前提高，成为一个独立民主的国家。在国际事务中已居于重要的地位。我们同伟大的社会主义苏联结成了牢不可破的友谊，和各国人民民主国家建立了兄弟般的友谊。这种伟大的同盟和友谊成为保卫远东和世界和平的无敌力量。从我们祖国的生产方面说，在短短的七年中取得了空前的高涨。现在的农民已不只在耕者有其田的水平上而是走上了合作化的道路，广大农民通过劳动生产的提高，生活已大大地改善。同时我们的工商业也不只在节制资本的水平上而是走上了社会主义的道路。在世界的和平事业中也获得了辉煌的成就，粉碎了战争叫嚣的阴谋。例如由我国和印度倡议的和平共处五项原则，得到世界上亚洲、非洲和许多国家的承认。现在与我国建立邦交的国家有二十八个，拥有十亿以上的人口。
    总的一句，伟大的人民力量，已推动了历史的车轮，通过新民主主义和社会主义革命的两个阶段，把半封建半殖民地的中国一变而为独立自由的社会主义的中国，在国际舞台上成为一个强盛的国家。在每一个角落都可看到蓬勃发展的新生气象，充满着无限的光明前景。不仅把孙中山奋斗一生的理想变成现实，而且远远地超过了他的理想。我们在人民革命的全面胜利中，追念革命先行者，应该从他的爱国热情，从他的革命毅力，从他的学习苏联的决心，体会到他的奋斗精神，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，为社会主义建设和世界和平事业继续奋斗。（附图片）
