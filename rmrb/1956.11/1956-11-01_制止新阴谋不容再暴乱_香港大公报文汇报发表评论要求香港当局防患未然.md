Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 31st: News from Hong Kong: Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po published short commentaries today, exposing the Kuomintang secret agents' conspiracy to create another riot.

Ta Kung Pao, in a short commentary titled "Prevent New Conspiracies, No More Riots Allowed," said: Although the Kowloon riot has passed, some signs indicate that Kuomintang secret agents are still attempting to create another riot, and they are even attempting to use more cunning and shameless methods to confuse people and achieve their goal of shifting blame. This is very noteworthy!

After listing many facts from reader complaints illustrating the Kuomintang secret agents' conspiracy to plan another riot, the newspaper pointed out: "All of these are despicable and vicious. Although these tricks are not new to those familiar with the Kuomintang secret agents' usual behavior, their conspiratorial preparations pose an unacceptable threat to the safety of life and property of Hong Kong residents. Hong Kong residents should be highly vigilant and pay close attention." The newspaper called on the British authorities in Hong Kong to take firm measures to resolutely stop the Kuomintang secret agents' criminal activities.

Wen Wei Po's short commentary said: Due to the Kowloon riot, the Hong Kong authorities did not take preventative measures beforehand and did not severely punish the instigators afterward. This has made the evildoers and escaped rioters even more daring and lawless. The commentary said: "Therefore, we hope that the Hong Kong authorities will learn from the painful lessons of the past, not only to quickly investigate the specific circumstances of the Kuomintang secret agents' conspiracy to create new incidents, deal with them, and take preventative measures, but also to earnestly take responsibility for ensuring the safety of the lives and property of Hong Kong and Kowloon workers, and not repeat the same mistakes."

    制止新阴谋不容再暴乱
    香港大公报文汇报发表评论要求香港当局防患未然
    新华社广州31日电　香港消息：大公报和文汇报今天发表短评，揭露国民党特务分子正在准备制造另一次暴乱的阴谋。
    大公报在题为“制止新阴谋，不容再暴乱”的短评中说：九龙大暴乱虽已过去，但有些迹象显示国民党特务仍企图制造另一次暴乱，而且他们还企图用更奸滑无耻的办法，混淆人们的耳目，以达到移尸嫁祸的目的。这是非常值得注意的！
    这家报纸在列举了许多读者投诉的事实，说明国民党特务分子又在进行策划另一次暴乱的阴谋活动以后指出：“凡此种种，都是卑鄙而毒辣的。虽然，在熟悉国民党特务一向所作所为的人，这些花样并不新鲜，但他们的这些阴谋准备，对于香港居民的生命财产安全，实系不可容许的威胁。值得香港居民提高警惕，密切注视。”这家报纸要求香港英国当局采取坚决的措施，认真制止国民党特务分子这种罪恶的活动。
    文汇报短评说：由于九龙暴乱事件，香港当局事前未有防范，事后未有严惩祸首，这就使得作恶的元凶和漏网的暴徒更胆大妄为，目无法理。短评说：“因此，我们希望香港当局，接受上次惨痛教训，不仅要迅速追查国民党特务阴谋制造新事件的具体情况，加以处理，防患未然；而且要切实负起保障港九工人同胞生命财产的安全，不要重蹈复辙。”
