Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 16th: The United Nations General Assembly held continuous meetings on the afternoon and evening of the 15th to continue discussing agenda items. The meetings mainly involved a fierce debate on the issue of Chinese representation. The Indian representative, Lall, proposed an amendment to the resolution passed by the General Committee on the 14th under the manipulation of the United States, which stipulated that the current session of the General Assembly would not discuss the issue of Chinese representation: 1. Not to include the issue of Chinese representation proposed by India on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly; 2. Not to discuss any proposals regarding the expulsion of Kuomintang elements or allowing representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the current session.

The Indian amendment advocated deleting the word "not" in the first paragraph and canceling the second paragraph. When introducing this amendment, Indian representative Lall pointed out that the American proposal passed by the General Committee exceeded the committee's authority.

The U.S. representative attempted to have the General Assembly hastily end the debate on this issue, but did not succeed. The meeting is scheduled to continue the debate today.

Before the debate on the issue of Chinese representation began, the meeting decided by a majority vote, despite the opposition of some colonial countries, to include the Cyprus issue, the West Irian issue, and the Algerian issue on the General Assembly's agenda.

The meeting also decided, despite the opposition of the representative of the Union of South Africa, to include the issue of the unequal status of people of Indian descent in the Union of South Africa and the issue of the South African government's implementation of apartheid policies on the General Assembly's agenda.

In addition, most items were passed without discussion or voting.

When the General Assembly turned to discuss the General Committee's resolution on the issue of Chinese representation, Soviet representative Shepilov stated that the United Nations organization, with the participation of seventy-nine countries, could not succumb to the will of one or a few countries on the issue of Chinese representation. Otherwise, it would only harm the United Nations organization itself.

He said that the United Nations General Assembly has been facing the issue of restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations for the seventh time. China's rights are beyond dispute. It is time to stop this abuse of the United Nations' moral and political capital by refusing to discuss the issue of Chinese representation. One out of every four people on this planet is Chinese, and yet the United Nations, an international organization that calls itself universal, does not have China's legitimate representatives.

Shepilov vehemently denounced the conspiracy to create two Chinas, saying that this conspiracy is a provocation against the great Chinese people, and also a provocation against the United Nations. This is essentially asking the United Nations to praise the United States for its permanent occupation of the Chinese island of Taiwan. Neither in the past nor now have there ever been two Chinas, there is only one China—the People's Republic of China.

Shepilov said that it is clear that those who are creating this conspiracy are playing with fire, because the Chinese people will never allow any part of Chinese territory to be taken away. Liberating Taiwan is the internal affair of the Chinese people.

Shepilov concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation fully supports the proposal put forward by the delegation of the Republic of India to immediately restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. We ask the delegations of other countries to also support this long overdue proposal. The Soviet delegation firmly insists on immediately and positively resolving the issue of restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.

U.S. representative Lodge, using the so-called "precedent" as an excuse, tried his best to advocate for the adoption of the General Committee's recommendation. He also said that India's proposal was "unnecessary" and that "he did not want to talk about the substance of the matter now."

The representatives of Britain, Ireland, and Kuomintang elements supported Lodge.

Yugoslav representative Popovic and Czechoslovak representative David supported India's proposal. Popovic said that the government of the People's Republic of China is the only government that can represent the Chinese people and fulfill the obligations contained in the United Nations Charter, and that without the presence of Chinese representatives, it is useless to discuss many issues. David said that the United States supports the Chiang Kai-shek elements in order to maintain its base in Taiwan to threaten peace and security in the Far East.

At the evening meeting, representatives from countries such as Indonesia, Nepal, Romania, and Albania spoke in support of India's amendment to the General Committee's recommendation. Australian representative Casey sided with the United States. U.S. representative Nolan spoke attacking India and slandering China. Indian representative Menon once again suggested adjournment, which the meeting accepted, and it was decided to continue the debate on the 16th.

    联大继续辩论议程问题
    谢皮洛夫痛斥制造“两个中国”的阴谋
    印度代表提出修正案要求大会讨论中国代表权问题
    据新华社16日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会15日下午和晚间连续举行会议，继续讨论议程问题。会议主要就中国代表权的问题展开了激烈的辩论。印度代表拉尔对总务委员会14日在美国操纵下通过的本届会议不讨论中国代表权的决议案提出了一项修正案，总务委员会的决议案规定：一、不把印度所提出的中国代表权的问题列入本届大会议程；二、在本届会议上不讨论任何关于排斥国民党分子或者让中华人民共和国代表出席的提案。
    印度的修正案主张删去第一段中的“不”字，并且取消第二段。印度代表拉尔在提出这个修正案时指出，总务委员会通过的美国议案超越了委员会的权限。
    美国代表企图使大会草草结束关于这个问题的辩论，但是没有达到目的。会议定今天继续辩论。
    在就中国代表权问题展开辩论之前，会议不顾一些殖民国家的反对以多数票决定把塞浦路斯问题、西伊里安问题和阿尔及利亚问题列入大会议程。
    会议还不顾南非联邦代表的反对，决定把南非联邦内印度血统人不平等地位问题和南非联邦政府实行种族隔离政策问题列入大会议程。
    另外还有大部分项目没有经过讨论和表决就通过了。
    苏联代表谢皮洛夫在大会转向讨论总务委员会关于中国代表权问题的决议时发言指出，有七十九个国家参加的联合国组织，在中国代表权问题上不能屈从于一个或者少数国家的意志。否则，就只会对联合国组织本身造成损害。
    他说，联合国大会面临恢复中国在联合国的合法权利的问题已经是第七次了。中国的权利毫无争辩的余地。拒绝讨论中国代表权问题这种滥用联合国道义和政治资本的行为，到了应当停止的时候了。我们这个行星上四个人中有一个是中国人，而在美其名为普遍性的国际组织联合国里却没有中国的合法代表。
    谢皮洛夫痛斥制造两个中国的阴谋，他说，这一阴谋是对伟大中国人民的挑衅，同时也是对联合国的挑衅，这样实质上就是要联合国去赞颂美国永远占领中国岛屿台湾。无论过去和现在，根本就没有两个中国，只有一个中国——中华人民共和国。
    谢皮洛夫说，很清楚，制造这种阴谋的人是在玩火，因为中国人民决不容许中国领土的任何一部分被夺去。解放台湾，这是中国人民的内部事情。
    谢皮洛夫最后说，苏联代表团完全支持印度共和国代表团提出的立即恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的建议。我们要求其他国家的代表团也支持这个早已成熟了的建议。苏联代表团坚决主张，立即肯定地解决恢复中国在联合国的合法权利的问题。
    美国代表洛奇以所谓“有先例可援”作借口，竭力主张通过总务委员会的建议。他并且说，印度的提案“是不必要的”，“现在他不想谈事情的实质”。
    英国、爱尔兰和国民党分子的代表支持洛奇。
    南斯拉夫代表波波维奇和捷克斯洛伐克代表戴维支持印度的建议。波波维奇说，中华人民共和国政府是唯一能够代表中国人民履行联合国宪章所包含的义务的政府，没有中国代表出席，有许多问题讨论是没有用的。戴维说，美国支持蒋介石分子是为了维持它在台湾的基地以威胁远东的和平和安全。
    在晚间会议上，印度尼西亚、尼泊尔、罗马尼亚和阿尔巴尼亚等国家的代表都发言支持印度对总务委员会建议的修正案。澳大利亚代表凯西替美国的立场帮腔。美国代表诺兰发言攻击印度和污蔑中国。印度代表梅农再一次建议休会，会议接受了这个建议，并且定于16日继续辩论。
