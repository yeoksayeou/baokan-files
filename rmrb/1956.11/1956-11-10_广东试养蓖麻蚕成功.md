Guangdong Successfully Trials Castor Silkworm Farming

    (Our report) This year, the Sericulture Improvement Institute of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture conducted the first trial rearing of castor silkworms in thirteen counties, including Xingning, Suixi, Chenghai, Kaiping, and Yingde. The results showed that, on average, 40 jin of fresh cocoons could be harvested per 10,000 silkworms. The Du'bei Agricultural Cooperative in Xingning County even achieved a high-yield record of 53 jin of cocoons per 10,000 silkworms.

    Castor silkworms are highly adaptable. In Guangdong, they can be raised seven to eight times a year, and they can spin cocoons after about fifteen days of feeding in the summer. The silk is snow-white and lustrous, finer than domestic silkworm silk, and can be used as a high-quality raw material for spun silk and synthetic wool short fibers. The silkworm pupae are also excellent feed for domestic poultry. Currently, many areas in the province are actively expanding castor bean cultivation in preparation for raising even larger quantities of castor silkworms next year. (Xiao Juncheng)

    广东试养蓖麻蚕成功
    本报讯　今年，广东省农业厅蚕业改进所第一次在兴宁、遂溪、澄海、开平、英德等十三个县试养蓖麻蚕，结果一般每万头蚕可收获鲜茧四十斤。兴宁县笃陂农业社还创造了每万头蚕产茧五十三斤的高产纪录。
    蓖麻蚕的适应性较强，在广东一年可养七至八回，夏天饲养十五天左右就可吐丝结茧。丝质雪白而富光泽，比家蚕丝细致，可作优良的绢纺和代羊毛短纤维原料；蚕蛹又可作家禽的良好饲料。现在，全省许多地区正积极扩种蓖麻，准备明年更大量地饲养。　（肖俊城）
