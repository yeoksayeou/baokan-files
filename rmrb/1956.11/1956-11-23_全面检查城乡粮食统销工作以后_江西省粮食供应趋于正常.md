Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 21st November: Since late October, Jiangxi Province has been conducting a comprehensive inspection of the unified purchase and sale of grain in urban and rural areas to correct the phenomenon of overly generous grain supply.

Currently, thirty-eight cities and towns have completed this work, and one hundred cities and towns are in the process of inspection. After inspection, the grain supply is tending towards normal. The average daily sales volume in the province from November 6th to 10th decreased by 5.84% compared to November 1st to 5th. By the end of September, the Qingshan Coal Mine in Pingxiang had a surplus of 19,900 catties of grain due to excessively high quotas, which has all been transferred to offset the November supply. In Anyi County, residents previously had a quota of thirty to thirty-one catties per person per month. During this inspection, different supply standards were determined based on the labor intensity of the residents, which can reduce the monthly supply by 43,000 catties. At the same time, attention was also paid to correcting the phenomenon of under-supply. Seven grain-deficient households in Miaoling Township, Xiushui County, were omitted due to the carelessness of the staff and had been borrowing grain for two months. They are now being supplied on a monthly basis and have been issued grain for the past two months.

Since July, Jiangxi Province's grain supply in urban and rural areas has exceeded sales volume month by month due to the relaxation of the grain department's leadership over the unified purchase and sale of grain. The province's sales volume in the third quarter exceeded the planned target by 30.9%, and increased by 12.3% compared to the same period last year.

    全面检查城乡粮食统销工作以后
    江西省粮食供应趋于正常
    新华社南昌21日电　江西省从10月下旬起，全面检查城乡粮食统销工作，纠正粮食供应偏宽现象。
    现在，已经有三十八个市镇结束了这一工作，有一百个市镇正在进行检查工作。经过检查，粮食供应趋于正常。全省11月6日至10日平均日销量，较11月1日至5日减少5.84％。萍乡青山煤矿到9月底止，定量偏宽多余的现粮有一万九千九百多斤，已全部转抵11月份的供应。安义县居民，过去每人每月定量三十至三十一斤，这次检查中，根据居民劳动强弱情况，分别核定不同的供应标准，每月可减少供应四万三千斤。同时，也注意了纠正少供应的现象。修水县庙岭乡七户缺粮户，因工作人员不细致漏掉了，两个月以来都是借粮吃，现已按月供应并且补发了过去两个月的粮食。
    江西省自7月份以来，由于粮食部门放松了对粮食统销工作的领导，城乡粮食供应月月超过销售量。全省第三季度销量超过计划指标30.9％，与去年同期比较，超销12.3％。
