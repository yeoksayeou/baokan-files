    If You Treat Commune Members Well, They Will Treat You Well
    Deng Yuxian
    Editor's Note: Deng Yuxian is the leader of the Second Production Team of the Yongfeng Cooperative in Daloufang Township, Andong County, Liaoning Province. From this recorded conversation, we can understand the reasons why the style of commandism has become more prevalent among some key members in some cooperatives after the establishment of advanced cooperatives. We can also understand that as long as ideological education is strengthened patiently and in a timely manner, this style is not difficult to correct. Furthermore, we can understand that if the unhealthy work style of the key members in the cooperative is transformed, the commune members will cherish them even more, and their enthusiasm for running the cooperative will be even higher.
    Last winter, after our large cooperative was established, I became the production team leader. At that time, I thought: This time it's an advanced cooperative, easy to lead! Every household is vying to join the cooperative, and the commune members' land and livestock belong to the cooperative. The commune members have no power to decide, so they have to do whatever the leadership tells them to do! It definitely shouldn't be more difficult to lead than when I led a small elementary cooperative of twenty-five households last year. I never thought that I still had to do persuasive education, propaganda, and explanation work with the commune members. Although the management committee meetings also talked about not using coercion and commandism with the commune members and being patient..., I didn't seriously follow that.
    One morning, production group leader Sun Wenli was late for breakfast. The commune members in his group were waiting for him to lead them in their work. If he was late, the whole group would slack off. Without saying anything to him, I immediately asked: Do you want to be the group leader? If you don't want to do it, give up your position early. You're responsible for delaying production. Sun Wenli didn't accept this, and retorted a couple of times. Seeing that he wasn't being humble, I scolded him again. I thought I wouldn't let you off easy, I would definitely remove him as group leader. From then on, Sun Wenli had opinions about me, and his work enthusiasm was not as good as before.
    During the summer hoeing season, the administrative group leader asked Zhao Lianke to provide labor for road construction. He didn't want to go, fearing it would delay earning points. He asked me: "Why do you have to ask me to build the road?" I got angry again and said, "You are a citizen, so you have to build the road. You have to go, there's no democracy to discuss with you." He said again: "If what I said is wrong, you can educate me, why are you so fierce?" I got even angrier and said: Even prisoners escorted by the court don't want to go, but they still have to be escorted! After I said this, Zhao Lianke left with a red face and a thick neck. Although he provided labor, his opinion of me was quite negative.
    The comrades of the Party general branch committee learned about my repeated actions. In early July, the deputy secretary of the general branch talked to me, first telling me about the benefits of running the cooperative democratically, and then reading the newspaper to me (I am illiterate), explaining the reasons why coercion and commandism cannot do a good job. At first, I didn't feel anything in my heart. However, I gradually began to think about it. I thought: Why do the commune members all have opinions about me? Why aren't other production teams like this? How would the commune members view me if I continued to do this? The more I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I felt. I regretted it. I said to the deputy secretary of the branch: "The commune members in the team have opinions about me, it's all my fault, it's all my fault for being too tough on them!" He patiently said to me: It doesn't matter if you have shortcomings, as long as you are willing to correct them. In the future, discuss things with the commune members properly, and the commune members will still support you. He also pointed out many work methods for me. I really felt happy in my heart. I was determined to correct these shortcomings in the future.
    Then, a meeting of the commune members in the team was convened. I made a self-criticism to everyone. Tears almost fell from my eyes. I really let down the commune members. When I was reprimanding people, I almost wanted to humiliate them to death. I made a resolution to the commune members, saying: Let's see how we do in the future. After the self-criticism, I talked to some commune members individually and made a self-criticism to them again. Zhao Lianke said: "It's not just your fault, we also have shortcomings. Let's work hard in the future, let's not worry about the past!" All the commune members said: Let's work hard and be stronger than other teams. This time the Party general branch's help to me was really great. From then on, I changed my attitude towards the commune members. Once, I discovered that production group leader Lu Guifu had privately recorded twelve points. At that time, my anger almost came up, but after thinking about it, I backed down. I very patiently said to him: "It's not right for you to record points privately! Is it reasonable to get paid without working?" His face turned red, he confessed his shortcomings, and immediately erased the points. Also, there was this person named Yu Defa, who had never liked to work much, and coupled with a slight illness, he hadn't done much work. I went to his house several times, explaining the principle of distribution according to work in detail. After listening, he also felt that it was wrong not to work, and proposed to do some light work. I discussed it with the group leader and let him graze the livestock. He agreed very much and started working. During the fall harvest, I saw that Wang Zhixian was not working with any spirit. I felt like something was on his mind. After understanding, it was because his family had no food to eat, and he was worried about not having a solution. I discussed it with the cooperative director and borrowed twenty yuan for him, and also lent him forty-eight jin of grain from my house. After his family's food problem was solved, he looked at me as if he wanted to say something, his expression and eyes always a bit affectionate. The commune members now all say: "Our team leader is really different from the past. He is really ambitious and changes his shortcomings as soon as he says he will." Now the commune members and I are especially close. (Recorded by Ma Weifu)

    你对社员好，社员才能对你好
    邓玉贤
    编者按　邓玉贤是辽宁省安东县大楼房乡永丰社第二生产队队长。从他这篇谈话记录中，我们可以了解到办了高级社以后某些社里的骨干分子中更多地发生了强迫命令作风的原因；也可以了解到，只要及时地耐心地加强思想教育工作，这种作风是不难纠正的；还可以了解到，社内骨干分子的不良作风转变了，社员群众就会更加爱护他们，办社的积极性就会更加高涨。
    去年冬天，我们的大社建成以后，我做了生产队长。当时我想：这回是高级社，好领导啦！家家户户都争着入社，社员的土地牲口都归了社，社员个人没有支配的权力，领导上叫他们干什么他们还不得干什么！决不能比我去年领导一个二十五户的小初级社难领导。我一点也没想到对社员还得作说服教育、宣传解释工作。管委会开会虽然也讲过对社员不能强迫命令，要耐心……，我也没有认真照着做。
    有一天早晨，生产组长孙文礼吃饭晚了点，他那组社员都等他来领导干活，他来晚了全组可就窝了点工。我什么没对他讲，开头就问：你愿不愿意当组长啦？你不愿意干趁早倒地方，窝工耽误生产你得负责。孙文礼也没服劲，顶了我两句。我看他还不虚心，就又斥责了他一顿。我寻思不用你僵，非撤掉你的组长不可。孙文礼从那以后，对我就有了意见，他干活的情绪也赶不上先前那样好。
    夏锄期间，行政组长叫赵连科出民工修公路，他不愿意去，害怕耽误挣分，他问我：“修公路怎么非叫我去？”我又来火了，我说：“你是个公民你就得修公路，你不去不行，和你们不能讲民主。”他又说：“我说的不对你对我教育教育，你横什么？”我更火了，我说：法院押的犯人，他还能愿意？可是就要押他！我这么一说，赵连科脸红脖子粗地走了；虽然出了民工，对我的意见可不小。
    我屡次这样办事，党总支委员会的同志知道了。在7月初，总支副书记找我谈话，首先和我讲了一些民主办社的好处，又念报给我听，（我不识字）对我讲强迫命令干不好工作的道理。我心里开始还不觉得什么。可是，渐渐又琢磨起来。我琢磨：社员为什么对我都有意见呢？人家别的生产队怎么没像这样呢？我这样干下去社员会怎样看待我呢？我越想越觉得心里不好受。我后悔了。我对支部副书记说：“队里社员对我有意见，都是怨我不对，都是怨我对他们太强硬啦！”他又耐心对我说：有缺点不要紧，只要肯改正，今后有事好好和社员商量，社员还是会拥护的。他又给我指出了很多的工作方法。我心里可真觉得爽快了。我下决心今后这些缺点一定改掉。
    接着，召开了队里的社员会议。我向大家作了检讨。我眼泪差点落下来。我确实对不起社员，在训斥人家的时候，简直想把人家辱死。我对社员下了决心，我说：好坏今后咱们再看吧。检讨完以后，我又找些社员个别讲了一讲，对他们又重新作了检讨。赵连科说：“这不怪你自己，我们也有缺点，今后咱们好好干，过去的事咱就别管啦！”各个社员都说：咱们好好干，一定要比别的队强一些。党总支这一次对我的帮助可真大。从那以后，我对社员改样了。有一次我发现生产组长卢贵富私自记了十二分。当时我的火刚想来，一寻思，又退了。我对他很耐心地说：“你私下记分不对呀！不劳动得报酬合理吗？”他脸红了一红，检讨了自己缺点，立刻把分抹去了。还有于德发这个人，素来就不大爱劳动，再加上稍有点病，就没干多少活。我就到他家说了好几次，详细解释了按劳取酬原则。他听过了也觉得不干活是不对，提出要干一些轻快活。我就和组长研究让他放牲口，他很同意，开始劳动了。挂锄积肥，我看王之贤干活一点精神没有，心里好像有事，一了解，是因为他家没有粮食吃了，他心里发愁没有办法。我和社主任商量给他借了二十元，又把我家的粮食借给他四十八斤。他家的吃粮问题解决了，他看见我好像不知想说些什么，脸色眼光总是有些深情。社员现在都说：“咱们队长真和过去大不一样啦。真有志气，有缺点说改就改。”现在社员和我都特别亲近。（马伟夫记）
