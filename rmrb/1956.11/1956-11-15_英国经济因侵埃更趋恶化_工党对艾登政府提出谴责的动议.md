Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from London: The British Labour Party introduced a motion in the House of Commons on the 12th, condemning the government's aggression against Egypt, which has exacerbated Britain's already serious economic situation.

　　Harold Wilson, Labour's principal spokesman on economic matters, spoke first. He believed that the cost of Britain's invasion of Egypt would likely undermine the entire basis of this year's budget. He said that the government's actions in Egypt would cost Britain an extra $200 million to $300 million in oil. “In people's minds,” the pound would have to be devalued again next year. He questioned whether the government was hoping to obtain a dollar loan.

　　Minister of Supply Reginald Maudling defended the government's policy. He denied that the pound would be devalued. At the same time, he admitted that the aggression in the Middle East had made Britain's dollars "somewhat tight." However, he also said that the exact impact could not be estimated until experts had examined the damage to the Suez Canal and the oil pipeline from the Iraqi oil fields. Maudling said that oil consumption in Britain and other Western European countries had already been reduced by 10%; preparations are still being made to take further action if necessary. He estimated the cost of the invasion of Egypt to be between 35 million and 45 million pounds.

　　Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan admitted that the invasion of Egypt had a serious impact on Britain's economy and foreign exchange reserves. But he also said that this impact was only temporary. He also praised the government's aggression, saying that it prompted the United Nations to establish its first "international emergency force," and that this "perhaps prevented a third world war."

　　The Labour Party's motion was defeated by 259 votes to 321.

    英国经济因侵埃更趋恶化
    工党对艾登政府提出谴责的动议
    新华社13日讯　伦敦消息：英国工党12日在下院提出一项动议，谴责政府侵略埃及的行动使英国严重的经济情况更加恶化。
    工党在经济问题上的主要发言人哈罗德·威尔逊首先发言。他认为，英国侵略埃及的费用很可能破坏今年预算的整个基础。他说，政府在埃及的行动将使英国在石油方面要多付出两亿到三亿美元。“在人们心目中”，明年英镑将不得不再度贬值。他质问政府是否希望得到一笔美元贷款。
    军需供应大臣雷金纳德·莫德林为政府政策辩解。他否认英镑将贬值。同时他承认，侵略中东使英国的美元有些拮据”但是他又说，在专家检查过苏伊士运河和从伊拉克油田引油的输油管的破坏情况以前，还不能确切地估计出影响有多大。莫德林说，在英国和其他西欧国家里，石油消费量已经削减了10％；现在还在准备在必要的时候采取进一步的行动。他估计侵略埃及的费用大概在三千五百万英镑到四千五百万英镑之间。
    财政大臣麦克米伦承认侵略埃及对英国的经济和外汇储备有严重的影响。但是他又说，这种影响只是暂时的。他还称赞政府的侵略行动，说这种行动促使联合国建立起它的第一支“国际紧急部队”，还说这“也许就制止了第三次世界大战”。
    工党的动议以二百五十九票对三百二十一票遭到否决。
