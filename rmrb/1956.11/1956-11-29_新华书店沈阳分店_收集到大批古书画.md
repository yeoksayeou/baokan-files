    Xinhua Bookstore Shenyang Branch
    Collects a Large Number of Ancient Books and Paintings
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Xinhua Bookstore Shenyang Branch has collected a large number of valuable ancient Chinese and foreign books and paintings this year, including more than 35,000 copies and 70,000 volumes of ancient books on classical literature, history, science and technology, medicine, agriculture, historical materials, and other aspects. Among them are the Ming Dynasty edition of "Compendium of Materia Medica" and "Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng" by the famous medical scientist Li Shizhen, the Ming Dynasty edition of "Yuefu Poetry Collection," and "San Dai Ji Jin Wen Cun," which studies the origin of Chinese characters, as well as the almost-lost "Landscape Middle Hall" personally painted by Gao Qipei, a finger painter of the Qing Dynasty in our country. There are also more than 20 handwritten poems by Wei Xiejun, a famous poet from outside the Guan during the Xianfeng period of the Qing Dynasty. These ancient books are valuable cultural heritage of our country. The store has now provided these ancient books to teachers, scientists, and doctors of traditional Chinese medicine in more than ten units, including Shenyang Agricultural College, Pharmaceutical College, and Liaoning Library, for their research and reference.
