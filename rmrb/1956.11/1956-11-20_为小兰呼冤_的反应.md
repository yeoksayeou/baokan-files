Reactions to "Injustice for Xiaolan"

    After this newspaper published Hanzi's "Injustice for Xiaolan" on page eight on October 21st, we have received over 500 letters and manuscripts from readers in more than 20 provinces (autonomous regions) and cities. The letters unanimously express regret for the deceased, condemn the despicable thoughts and actions of Liu Yunzhen and others, and demand that relevant departments give them serious punishment.

    Many young people pointed out in their letters that in our bright and splendid new society, there are indeed some people with serious bureaucratism and privilege-seeking thinking. In order to maintain their so-called "prestige" and "dignity," and to satisfy their personal desires, they even use their power to harm young people, obstruct their progress, causing young people's depression, dejection, and even tragic consequences. These people are indifferent to and disregard the young people's fervent requests to join the Party and the League. They even use some non-principled issues of the youth as an excuse to prevent them from joining the League and the Party. They do not care about the sufferings of lower-level workers, do not pay attention to their voices and demands, do not value their enthusiasm, and do not support their struggle against bureaucratism. The letters unanimously expressed the need to wage a resolute struggle against the above phenomena, and requested that Party organizations and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels give them firm support in this struggle.

    Letters from some Party League and trade union workers pointed out that Xiao Lan's death should be taken as a profound lesson to overcome the phenomenon of indifference to the reasonable demands of young people in their work. They should protect young people's irreconcilable struggle against backward phenomena.

    Many people believe that young people should also learn a lesson from Xiao Lan's death. They should have the courage and confidence to struggle, have full trust in the Party and the masses, and should not commit suicide passively. Reader Bai Shi believes that in our bright and splendid society, as long as we continue to struggle, victory will surely belong to the just. Some people cited the Jikai Fu incident as an example to illustrate that the situation was far more severe than Liu Yunzhen and others oppressing Xiao Lan, but through the parties' resolute struggle and the support of higher-level Party organizations and state organs, complete victory was still achieved.

    Some people have accused and exposed some incidents in their letters, and the editorial department has forwarded these letters to the relevant departments for investigation and handling.

### “为小兰呼冤”的反应

    “为小兰呼冤”的反应
    本报10月21日八版发表了菡子的“为小兰呼冤”一文后，已收到读者从二十多个省（自治区）、市寄来的五百多封信和稿件，来信一致对死者表示惋惜，指责刘云振等人的卑劣思想和行为，并要求有关部门给以严正的处理。
    许多青年的来信中指出，在我们光明灿烂的新社会里，的确还有一些人有着严重的官僚主义和特权思想，他们为了保持个人的所谓“威信”、“尊严”，为了满足个人的私欲，竟至利用权力戕害青年，阻挡青年们前进的道路，造成青年的苦闷、消沉，甚至造成惨痛的后果。这些人对青年们入党、入团的热烈要求，加以冷淡和漠视，甚至借口青年的某些并非原则性的问题来阻止他们入团，入党，不关心下层工作人员的疾苦，不注意他们的呼声、要求，不重视他们的积极性，不支持他们对官僚主义的斗争。来信中一致表示要对上述种种现象进行坚决的斗争，并要求各地党组织、青年团组织给他们这种斗争以坚决的支持。
    一些党团和工会工作者的来信指出：应把小兰的死当作一个深刻的教训，克服工作中对青年合理的要求的漠不关心现象，应该保护青年向落后现象进行不调和的斗争。
    许多人认为青年们也应当从小兰的死取得教训，应该有斗争的勇气和信心，对党和群众应有充分的信赖，不应该消极自杀。读者白石认为：在我们这个光明灿烂的社会里，只要斗争下去，胜利一定是属于正义的人的。有人举了纪凯夫事件作例来说明，情况远比刘云振等压迫小兰为厉害，但是经过当事人的坚决斗争，上级党组织和国家机关的支持，还是取得了完全的胜利。
    有些人在来信中控诉和揭发了一些事件，编辑部已把这些信件转交有关部门调查处理。
