Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, delivered a speech in Beijing today, discussing the "issue of building the China-Myanmar Friendship Mansion" that Premier Zhou Enlai and he "are committed to."

Chairman U Nu delivered his speech at a gathering attended by over 1,500 people this afternoon at the invitation of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

At 2:40 PM, Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice-Chairman of the CPC Central Committee, and others accompanied Chairman U Nu and other Burmese guests onto the stage. The venue erupted in warm applause to welcome the Burmese guests.

When discussing the construction of the Friendship Mansion, Chairman U Nu said that this is "an issue related to the mutual interests of the Burmese and Chinese people." He said: "If people superficially imagine such a mansion, they may feel that it would be difficult to make this friendship sincere and lasting." He mentioned the ideological differences between China and Myanmar. However, he said, the cultivation and consolidation of friendship should be based on the common factors that characterize the people of both countries. He said that which ideology Chinese and Burmese people should adopt can only be decided by the Chinese and Burmese themselves. Therefore, mere ideological differences should never become an obstacle to promoting good relations between China and Myanmar.

After listing some facts, Chairman U Nu said that there are many similarities between the people of China and Myanmar. He expressed no doubt that eternal friendship could be established between China and Myanmar. He said, "I would like to emphasize that a necessary factor in building this friendship is the Five Principles endorsed by Premier Zhou Enlai and myself."

Subsequently, Chairman U Nu analyzed in detail the contribution of these Five Principles to China-Myanmar friendship and explained that the Burmese leaders and people wholeheartedly endorse and support these Five Principles.

Chairman U Nu's speech was repeatedly interrupted by thunderous applause.

At the beginning of the meeting, Li Jishen, Vice-Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, spoke, warmly welcoming "old friend of the Chinese people" Chairman U Nu. He said: Chairman U Nu is an outstanding Burmese politician, one of the initiators of the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has made many contributions to promoting China-Myanmar friendship, strengthening Asian-African solidarity, and safeguarding world peace. Now, Chairman U Nu is working closely with Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe to continue his efforts to strengthen friendly cooperation between China and Myanmar.

Speaking of Chairman U Nu's talks with Chinese state leaders, Li Jishen said that these talks will further enhance the friendly relations between China and Myanmar and will also be conducive to the solidarity of Asian and African countries and world peace.

After Chairman U Nu finished his speech, Chairman Zhou Enlai delivered a speech, expressing his gratitude for his speech. Chairman Zhou Enlai said: I believe that after Chairman U Nu's visit to China again and his moving speech today, it will make a greater contribution to the friendship between China and Myanmar and the solidarity of the people of the two countries. On behalf of the Chinese people, I would like to reiterate here: We will always adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and strive for the further development and consolidation of the friendship between the people of China and Myanmar.

Other Burmese guests who came to China for a visit with Chairman U Nu, the head of the Burmese Women's Delegation, Burmese Ambassador to China U Hla Maung and his wife were also invited to attend today's meeting.

Those present at today's meeting included the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Standing Committee members and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consulative Conference, representatives of the National People's Congress, heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations in China, cadres from various departments of the CPC Central Committee, heads and staff of various offices, ministries, commissions, and directly affiliated institutions of the State Council, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar, heads of the China-Myanmar Friendship Association, and people from all walks of life in Beijing.

    在政协全国委员会举行的盛大集会上
    吴努发表演说谈建立“中缅友谊大厦”
    新华社2日讯　缅甸联邦反法西斯自由同盟主席吴努今天在北京发表演说，谈周恩来总理和他“所致力的建设中缅友谊大厦的问题”。
    吴努主席是在今天下午应中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会的邀请，在一个有一千五百多人参加的集会上发表演说的。
    下午二时四十分，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会主席、中共中央副主席周恩来等人陪同吴努主席和其他缅甸客人们登上主席台。这时会场响起了热烈的掌声，向缅甸客人们表示欢迎。
    吴努主席在谈到建设友谊大厦时说，这是“关系到缅甸和中国人民双方面利益的一个问题”。他说：“如果人们粗浅地设想这样一座大厦时，也许会感觉到要使这种友谊真诚和持久是会遭遇到困难的。他谈到中缅两国在意识形态上有差异。但是，他说，友谊的培养和巩固应当建立在标志着两国人民特点的共同因素的基础上。他说，中国人和缅甸人应该采择那一种意识形态，这只能由中国人、缅甸人自己去决定。因此仅仅意识形态上的差异绝不应该成为促进中缅两国良好关系的障碍。
    吴努主席在列举了一些事实后说，中缅两国人民之间是有不少相同点的。他表示丝毫不怀疑中国和缅甸之间能够建立永恒的友谊。他说，我愿意强调一下，建成这种友谊的一个必要因素，就是周恩来总理和我所赞同的五项原则。
    接着，吴努主席详细分析了这五项原则对中缅友谊的贡献，并且说明缅甸领袖们和人民是衷心的赞同和支持这五项原则的。
    吴努主席的演说不断为暴风雨般的掌声所打断。
    在会议开始时，政协全国委员会副主席李济深曾在会上讲话，他对“中国人民的老朋友”吴努主席表示热烈欢迎。他说：吴努主席是缅甸的杰出政治家，是著名的和平共处五项原则倡议人之一，对促进中缅友好、加强亚非国家团结和维护世界和平有过很多贡献。现在吴努主席正和缅甸联邦政府吴巴瑞总理紧密合作，继续为加强中缅两国友好合作而努力。
    谈到吴努主席同我国国家领导人进行会谈时，李济深说，这些会谈将会进一步增进中缅两国的友好关系，同时也会有利于亚非各国的团结和世界和平。
    吴努主席演说结束后，周恩来主席致词，对他的演说表示感谢。周恩来主席说：我相信经过吴努主席这次再度来中国访问和他今天这篇动人的演说，对于中缅两国的友谊和两国人民的团结将会有更大的贡献。我代表中国人民愿在这里再一次表示：我们是永远坚持和平共处的五项原则，为中缅人民的友谊进一步的发展和巩固而努力。
    和吴努主席一起来中国访问的其他缅甸客人们，缅甸妇女代表团负责人，缅甸驻中国大使吴拉茂和夫人也都应邀出席了今天的会议。
    出席今天会议的，有中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会主席、副主席、常务委员和委员，全国人民代表大会代表，中国各民主党派、各人民团体负责人，中共中央各部门干部，国务院各办公室和各部、委以及直属机构的负责人和机关干部，外交部负责人，中国驻缅甸大使，中缅友好协会负责人以及北京市各界人士。
