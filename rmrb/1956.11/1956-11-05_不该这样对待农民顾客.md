　　Farmers Should Not Be Treated This Way
　　Jiang Xia
　　Businessmen in the old society had one characteristic: they conducted business based on who they were dealing with. They were extremely obsequious and provided attentive service to those who looked grand and dressed lavishly, while they were very cold to ordinary working people. Especially those "rustic" farmer customers often became the target of their bullying. However, even at that time, people did not approve of this behavior, contemptuously calling such businessmen "snobs." Unfortunately, this "snobbish" practice has not completely disappeared in the new society. Please take a look at the two reader letters published below.
　　Why did the sales staff of the Daodong Department Store in Siping City ignore that farmer customer? Why did they dare to kick and beat this farmer customer, pushing him from upstairs to downstairs? If it is said that they lack moral education for socialist commercial workers, have they even forgotten that the national constitution stipulates that human rights must not be violated? It seems that they are no longer socialist commercial workers serving the people, but rather aristocratic masters who oppress the people in the old society! The Daodong Department Store in Siping City should regard this incident as its own great shame.
　　It cannot be said that the occurrence of this behavior is accidental. People often see varying degrees of discrimination against farmers in other commercial sectors as well. It is understood that the reason why some commercial departments' salespersons and service personnel intentionally or unintentionally treat farmer customers slowly is because, in their view: farmers are rustic, cannot buy much, but bring a lot of "trouble."
　　This is obviously extremely wrong. First, not everyone who goes to a department store wants to buy a large quantity of goods; sometimes, although they want to buy a lot, the department store does not have suitable items. This situation is, of course, no exception for farmer customers. Second, can farmers really not afford to buy a large quantity of goods? No. According to typical investigations in Henan, Hebei, and Zhejiang provinces, the purchasing power of farmers in 1955 increased by 38.4% compared to 1954, and it is estimated that it will increase by 52.56% in 1956 compared to 1955. Moreover, even if farmers do not buy anything at all in the store, but just visit and look around, they should not be treated with a rude attitude!
　　Farmers do not often come to the city unless they have something to do, and they are relatively unfamiliar with urban life. Therefore, when they come to the city, they are not as comfortable as city dwellers in terms of walking, lodging, eating, or buying things; therefore, they will feel a lot of inconvenience and difficulties in the city. In this case, all socialist commercial and service industry workers who come into contact with farmers should warmly receive them, patiently understand their needs, proactively plan for them, make them live comfortably, enable them to buy satisfactory things with less money, and leave them with a good impression of the city. This is a political task that socialist commercial workers cannot ignore.

    不该这样对待农民顾客
    江夏
    旧社会的生意人有一个特点，他们做生意是看人行事的：对待外表堂皇、穿得阔气的人百般恭顺，服务周到；对待普通的劳动人民却十分冷淡。特别是那些“土里土气”的农民顾客，常常成为他们欺侮的对象。但是，就是在当时，人们也并不赞成这种行为，他们轻蔑地把这种生意人叫作“势利眼”。可惜得很，这种“势利眼”的作风在新社会里并没有完全绝迹。请看看下面发表的两封读者来信吧。
    四平市道东百货公司的营业人员为什么不理睬那位农民顾客？为什么竟敢连踢带打把这位农民顾客从楼上推到楼下？如果说他们是缺乏社会主义商业工作人员的道德教育，难道他们连国家宪法所规定的不许侵犯人权也忘记了吗？看起来他们已经不像是为人民服务的社会主义商业工作人员，而像是旧社会里欺压人民的贵族老爷了！四平市道东百货公司应该把这件事看成是自己的奇耻大辱。
    不能说这种行为的发生是偶然的。人们也常常在其它商业部门看到程度不同的歧视农民的现象。据了解，有些商业部门的营业员、服务员所以有意无意地慢怠农民顾客，是因为在他们看来：农民土里土气，买不了多少东西，却招来很多“麻烦”。
    这显然是极端错误的。第一、去百货公司的人，不一定都要买大量商品；有时虽然想买很多东西，但百货公司却没有合适的。这种情况对农民顾客当然也不会例外。第二、农民顾客真的买不起大量商品吗？不是。根据河南、河北、浙江三省的典型调查，1955年农民购买力较1954年增长38.4％，1956年预计将比1955年增长52.56％。再说，即使农民到商店里一点东西也不买，只是参观参观，也不该用蛮横的态度对待他们啊！
    农民没有事情是不常进城的，他们对城市生活是比较生疏的。因此，他们进城的时候，不论在走路、住宿、吃饭、购买东西等方面都不像城里人那么自如；因此，他们在城市中会感到很多不方便和困难。在这种情况下，一切和农民相接触的社会主义商业和服务性行业的工作人员，都应该热情地接待农民，耐心地了解他们的需要，主动地为他们打算，使他们生活得安适，使他们花较少的钱买到称心满意的东西，使他们对城市留下良好的印象。这是社会主义商业工作人员不容忽视的一项政治任务。
