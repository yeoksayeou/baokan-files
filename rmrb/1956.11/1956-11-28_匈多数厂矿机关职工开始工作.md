Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 26th: According to TASS, the majority of workers and staff in factories, mines, power stations, state organs, and social organizations across Hungary, responding to the call of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and the Workers' Council, resumed work on November 26th.

　　In Budapest, the number of workers reporting for work at various factories on this day reached 80%. Approximately four-fifths of the workers at the New Pest Tractor Factory have resumed production, and the textile factories here are operating in two shifts. The "Duna" shoe factory in Small Pest has already produced goods.

　　Almost all industrial enterprises feel an extreme shortage of raw materials, fuel, and especially electricity. This is the main difficulty now hindering the complete normalization of production. The Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other socialist countries are providing Hungary with the coal, raw materials, and equipment necessary for production. According to the recent agreement signed between the Romanian and Hungarian governments, a large amount of goods aided by Romania has already been transported to the eastern region of Hungary.

　　The situation in the countryside is gradually stabilizing. On this day, more than 5,500 people reported for work at the Győr Vehicle Manufacturing Plant, Hungary's largest. Those who failed to report for work without a valid reason were considered to have resigned. In Mosonmagyaróvár, almost all workers in various industrial enterprises have reported for work. Most enterprises in Nyíregyháza have resumed production. The agricultural machinery repair factory here also almost fully resumed operation on this day. Miners in Várpalota began work. They plan to mine seventy cars of coal daily by the middle of this week. In Tatabánya, an increasing number of miners are beginning to work.

    匈多数厂矿机关职工开始工作
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯26日讯：匈牙利全国大多数的工厂、矿井、电站、国家机关和社会机关的工人和职员，响应了工农革命政府和工人委员会的号召，在11月26日又开始工作了。
    布达佩斯各工厂这一天上工的职工已经达到80％。新佩斯拖拉机工厂的工人约近五分之四已经恢复生产，这里的纺织工厂分为两班工作。小佩斯“杜纳”制鞋工厂已经制造出产品。
    差不多所有的工业企业都感到原料、燃料极端不足，特别是电力不足。这就是现在生产完全正常化的主要困难。苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和其他社会主义国家正在提供匈牙利生产上所必需的煤以及原料和设备。根据最近罗匈两国政府签订的协定，罗马尼亚援助的大量货物已经运到匈牙利东部地区。
    外地情况日渐稳定。匈牙利全国最大的吉厄尔车辆制造厂这一天有五千五百多人上工。无故不上工的人被认为辞职。在莫松马乔罗瓦市，各工业企业中几乎全部工人都已经上工。尼雷吉哈佐大部分企业已经恢复生产。这里的农业机器修理厂这一天也几乎已经全部开工。瓦尔波拉塔矿工们开始工作。到本周中，他们打算每天开采七十车皮的煤。在托托巴尼奥越来越多矿工开始工作。
