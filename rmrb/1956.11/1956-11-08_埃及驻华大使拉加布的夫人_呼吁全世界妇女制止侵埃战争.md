Xinhua News Agency, 7th - Mrs. Ragab, wife of the Ambassador of the Republic of Egypt to China, issued an appeal to women all over the world today, urging women everywhere to do everything they can to stop the Anglo-French imperialist aggression against Egypt.

The appeal was read at a press conference held by Ambassador Ragab this morning.

The full text of Mrs. Ragab’s appeal to women around the world is as follows:

Great Britain, France, and Israel have launched an attack on Egyptian territory without any legitimate reason. In doing so, they have killed thousands of innocent mothers and children in undefended cities, and destroyed many homes and properties, leaving thousands homeless. Even hospitals, monasteries, and churches have not been spared in their unjust attacks.

As a woman, I appeal to women all over the world to do everything in their power to stop not only the unjust war against Egypt, but also any unjust war anywhere in the world.

Thanks to the progress of modern science and the arts, our world has become much smaller than it used to seem.

Destructive weapons are becoming many times more deadly than they were twenty years ago. A conflagration in any region of our troubled world, no matter how far it may seem from your own country, can spread to your own homes in a very short time. As a mother with an only son on the front lines defending his country, I appeal to mothers around the world to do everything in their power to stop wars of aggression. I especially appeal to the mothers of Britain and France, whose sons are being sent to the shores of Egypt to die not for any just cause, but merely to satisfy the insatiable greed of imperialist warmongers.

As a member of the Egyptian Red Crescent Society and the Red Cross, I appeal to the Red Crescent and Red Cross societies and similar relief organizations around the world to rush all medical supplies, medicines, and nurses to Egypt. Egyptian hospitals are struggling to cope with the large number of casualties caused by the air raids on Egyptian cities.

As for the Chinese people and women, I express my sincere respect for all they have done to help the cause of Egypt. I have seen thousands of Chinese women and girls walking for hours in the city streets of China in the rain and cold weather to express their solidarity with the struggle of Egypt and their anger at the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt. To all of them, I would like to express my heartfelt and infinite gratitude.

### 埃及驻华大使拉加布的夫人  呼吁全世界妇女制止侵埃战争

    埃及驻华大使拉加布的夫人
    呼吁全世界妇女制止侵埃战争
    新华社7日讯　埃及共和国驻中国大使拉加布的夫人今天向全世界妇女发出呼吁书，吁请全世界的妇女尽她们所能来制止英法帝国主义对埃及的侵略。
    呼吁书是今天上午在拉加布大使举行的记者招待会上宣读的。
    拉加布大使的夫人向全世界妇女发出的呼吁书全文如下：
    英国、法国和以色列毫无正当理由地对埃及领土发动了攻击。它们在这样做的时候杀害了不设防城市中的数以千计的无辜母亲和儿童，和摧毁了许多房屋和财产，致使数以千计的人无家可归。甚至医院、寺院和教堂在它们的不正义攻击中也不能幸免。
    作为一个妇女，我吁请全世界的妇女尽她们所能来制止不仅是对埃及的不正义战争，而且还有世界任何地方的不正义战争。
    由于现代科学和艺术的进展，我们的世界已变得比它过去看起来要小得多了。
    毁灭性的武器正在变得比它们二十年前的情况要致命得不知多少。在我们这个多事的世界的任何地区发生的战火，不论它看起来离开你们的国家多么远，可以在非常短的时间内波及到你们自己的家园。作为有一个独子在前线保卫祖国的母亲，我吁请全世界的母亲们尽她们所能来制止侵略战争。我特别吁请英国和法国的母亲们，她们的儿子不是为了任何正当的理由、只是为了满足帝国主义战争贩子的无餍贪欲而被送到埃及海岸上去就死。
    作为埃及的红新月会和红十字会的一个成员，我吁请世界各地的红新月会和红十字会以及类似的救济组织赶运一切医药用具、药品和护士到埃及去。埃及的各医院正在应付不了在对埃及城市的空袭中所造成的大量伤亡。
    至于中国人民和妇女，我对他们为了帮助埃及的事业而做的一切表示诚挚的敬意。我已经看到过数以千计的中国妇女和女孩子在中国的城市街道上在大雨中和很冷的气候中行走数小时以表示她们同埃及的斗争的休戚相共以及她们对英法侵略埃及的愤怒。对她们全体，我愿意衷心表示无限的感谢。
