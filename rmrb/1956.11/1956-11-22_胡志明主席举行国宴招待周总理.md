Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 21st: Chairman Ho Chi Minh hosted a state banquet tonight in honor of Premier Zhou Enlai, who is currently visiting Vietnam, as well as Vice Premier He Long and other accompanying personnel.

At the banquet, Ho Chi Minh said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Vietnam and his upcoming visits to other friendly Asian countries, he believed, would certainly strengthen the unity of the Asian people and further develop the Five Principles.

Ho Chi Minh said that he was very pleased with the Chinese Premier's visit to Vietnam, which brought with it the warm friendship of the Chinese people. He said that for more than 30 years, thanks to the Chinese Communist Party, the good-neighborly relations between the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples, which have existed since ancient times, have become even closer.

Ho Chi Minh quoted a simple saying of the Vietnamese people to express their deep feelings for the Chinese people. He said that a cadre from the South said, "When I heard the news of Premier Zhou Enlai's friendly visit to Vietnam, I thought of the continuous assistance and support the Chinese people have given to the Vietnamese people, and of the Chinese comrades who helped us in Vietnam, some of whom have given their lives. We are a heroic nation, and to be able to have such good brothers makes us even more confident that we can overcome any difficulties."

Ho Chi Minh also said, "For me, Zhou Enlai is my brother. We have shared joys and sorrows and worked together in the revolution. He has been my close comrade-in-arms for more than 30 years."

In his reply, Zhou Enlai said that he thanked Chairman Ho Chi Minh for his enthusiastic speech. He said that Chairman Ho's assessment of their visit was actually an assessment of the Chinese people and an expression of friendship toward the Chinese people. He wished to take this close friendship back and convey it to the Chinese people.

Zhou Enlai said that the assistance that Chairman Ho had mentioned China given to Vietnam was not worth mentioning; the real strength came from the Vietnamese people. It was the Vietnamese people who, with their own strength, carried out a heroic struggle for liberation, achieved a great victory, and carried out arduous reconstruction work. The Chinese people are proud to have such heroic brotherly people!

Zhou Enlai said that Chairman Ho had just mentioned that he had known him personally more than 30 years ago. "Yes, 34 years ago, I met Chairman Ho in Paris. He was my guide at the time. He was already a mature Marxist at that time, and I had just joined the Communist Party. He is my elder brother."

Zhou Enlai said that over the past 30 years, he had also seen the path taken by the Vietnamese people from Chairman Ho's experience and had seen the spirit of long-term hard work of the Vietnamese people. In the more than 30 years that he had known Chairman Ho, his life had always been so simple and unadorned, and his appearance, spirit, and way of life had not changed. During this visit, he also saw the excellent style of the Vietnamese people, like that of Chairman Ho Chi Minh. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are continuing to promote the spirit of hard work and simplicity. We have learned a great deal from Chairman Ho and the Vietnamese people in this regard. Every nation, regardless of its size, has something worth learning from it. On the eve of our departure, I would like to thank you all. Our visit has not been in vain. We have learned many things from your hard work, simplicity, and hardworking spirit, and we will take it back to the Chinese people as a precious gift!"

Tonight's banquet was held in a very intimate and friendly atmosphere throughout. During the banquet, Chairman Ho Chi Minh and Premier Zhou Enlai also pinned red roses on each other's chests.

Attending tonight's banquet were Premier Pham Van Dong, Vice Premiers Phan Ke Toai and Vo Nguyen Giap, Standing Committee Chairman of the Vietnamese National Assembly Ton Duc Thang, ministers of various ministries of the Vietnamese government, leading officials of various parties and people's organizations, heads of diplomatic missions in Hanoi, representatives of the International Commission, and nearly one hundred other people.

    胡志明主席举行国宴招待周总理
    新华社河内21日电　胡志明主席今天晚上举行国宴，招待现在越南访问的周恩来总理和随同前来访问的贺龙副总理和其他人员。
    胡志明在宴会上说，周恩来总理这次访问了越南，并且将访问其他亚洲友好国家，我相信，通过这次友好的访问，一定将加强亚洲人民的团结，一定会使五项原则得到更广泛、更进一步的发展。
    胡志明说，他对中国总理的这次访问越南，并且带来了中国人民亲切的友谊感到非常高兴。他说，三十多年来，由于有了中国共产党，已经使得越中两国人民自古以来的善邻关系更加亲密起来。
    胡志明引了一位越南人民所说的朴素的语言，来表达越南人民对中国人民的亲切感情，他说，有一位来自南方的干部说，在听到周恩来总理来到越南作友好访问的消息的时候，我联想到中国人民不断给予越南人民的援助和支持，联想到在越南帮助我们的中国同志，有的已经付出他们的生命；我们是英雄的民族，而又能得到这样好的兄弟，这就使我们更加相信我们不管有任何的困难，都能够加以克服。
    胡志明还说，对我来说，周恩来是我的兄弟，我们曾经在一起共甘苦、一起做革命工作。他是我三十多年来的亲密的战友。
    周恩来在答辞中说，他感谢胡志明主席的热情的讲话。他说，胡主席对他们这次的访问的估价，实际上是对中国人民的估价，对中国人民的友好表示，他愿把这种亲密的友谊带回去转达给中国人民。
    周恩来说，胡主席所说的中国对越南的援助是不足称道的，真正的力量是来自越南人民。是越南人民以自己的力量，进行了英勇的解放斗争，取得了伟大的胜利，进行了艰巨的恢复建设工作。中国人民以有这样英勇的兄弟人民而骄傲！
    周恩来说，胡主席刚才提到我个人在三十多年前认识了他。是的，三十四年前，我在巴黎认识了胡主席，他是当时我的引路人。他在当时已经是一个成熟的马克思主义者，而我那时候还刚刚加入共产党。他是我的老大哥。
    周恩来说，三十多年来，我也从胡主席的经历看到了越南人民所走过的道路，看到越南人民长期艰苦奋斗的精神。在我认识胡主席的三十多年中，他的生活永远是如此简单朴素，他的样子、精神和生活方式都没有改变。在这次访问中，我也看到了越南人民像胡志明主席这样的优良作风。中国人民在毛泽东主席的指导下，正在继续提倡艰苦朴素的精神。这一点，我们从胡主席和越南人民身上得到了很好的学习。任何民族不分大小，都有它值得学习的地方。在离别的前夕，我愿感谢各位，我们这次没有白来，我们已经从你们的勤劳朴实、艰苦奋斗的作风中学到许多东西，我们将把它当作高贵的礼物，带回去给中国人民！
    今晚的宴会始终在非常亲密友好的气氛中进行。席间，胡志明主席和周恩来总理还互相在胸前带上了红玫瑰花。
    参加今晚宴会的有：总理范文同，副总理潘继遂、武元甲，越南国民大会常务委员会委员长孙德胜，越南政府各部部长，各党派和人民团体的主要负责人，各国驻河内的使节和国际委员会代表等近一百人。
