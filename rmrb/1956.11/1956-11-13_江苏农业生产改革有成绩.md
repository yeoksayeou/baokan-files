Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Jiangsu Province has achieved success this year in implementing agricultural production reforms on more than 15 million mu of land, increasing grain production by approximately 1 billion jin.

In the Taihu Lake high-yield rice area, 600,000 mu of single-season rice were converted to double-season rice. The average yield of early and late rice crops reached 700 to 750 jin per mu, an increase of 200 jin compared to single-season rice. In the Lixiahe area and the mountainous areas of Zhenjiang and Yangzhou, where the conversion from indica rice to japonica rice was most extensive, the yield of over 7 million mu of japonica rice increased by nearly 500 million jin compared to the original indica rice. Farmers in Binhai, Funing, Huai'an, and other counties along both banks of the Subei Irrigation Canal converted dry land into paddy fields and planted rice on a large scale for the first time, achieving double the yield compared to the original dry land miscellaneous grain crops. Farmers in various regions also adapted to local conditions and converted more than 5 million mu of low-yield crops to locally recognized high-yield crops such as corn and sweet potatoes, resulting in excellent harvests.

In the work of agricultural production reform, the state provided multi-faceted support to farmers. Prior to planting, Jiangsu Province established an Agricultural Technology Guidance Committee. The committee organized more than 500 agricultural scientists, agricultural professors, and agricultural technicians to delve into the base points of production reform work, conduct typical investigations and special studies, and guide the overall work through the base points. These technicians trained over 1 million agricultural cooperative technicians in various places to promote agricultural production reform. In terms of means of production, the state supplied Jiangsu farmers with more improved seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, sprayers, and new agricultural tools this year than last year. Government agencies at all levels led agricultural cooperatives in building nearly 500 million cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects, providing water conservancy conditions for agricultural production reform.

Following the success of agricultural production reform, agricultural cooperatives in various regions are currently summarizing experiences and formulating production reform plans for next year. The Lianmeng Agricultural Cooperative in Taixian County plans to increase the area for agricultural production reform next year by 39% compared to this year.

    江苏农业生产改革有成绩
    新华社南京电　江苏省今年在一千五百多万亩土地上实行农业生产改革获得成功，增产粮食十亿斤左右。
    太湖水稻高产地区单季稻改双季稻六十万亩，早晚两季平均每亩收七百斤到七百五十斤，比种单季稻增产两百斤。籼稻改粳稻最多的里下河地区和镇（江）扬（州）山区，七百多万亩粳稻比原来种籼稻增产近五亿斤。苏北灌溉总渠两岸的滨海、阜宁、淮安等县农民把旱地改成水田，第一次大面积种水稻，获得比原来种旱地杂粮作物增产一倍的成就。各地农民还因地制宜把五百多万亩低产作物改种当地认可的高产作物玉米、甘薯等，结果收成也很好。
    在农业生产改革工作中，国家对农民作了多方面的支持。播种以前，江苏省成立了农业技术指导委员会。委员会组织五百多位农业科学家、农学教授和农业技术员，深入生产改革工作的基点，作典型调查和专题研究，通过基点去指导全面。这些技术人员在各地为推行农业生产改革而训练的农业社技术员，有一百多万人。在生产资料方面，今年国家供应给江苏省农民的良种、肥料、农药、药械和新式农具都比去年多。各级政府机关领导农业社兴修水利工程近五亿土方，为农业生产改革提供了水利条件。
    农业生产改革获得成功以后，各地农业社目前正一面总结经验，一面制定明年的生产改革计划。泰县联盟农业社计划明年实行农业生产改革的面积比今年增加39％。
