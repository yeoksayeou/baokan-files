　　Starting with Summarizing Work

　　1956 is coming to an end. Rural work this year has developed very rapidly and has been very rich in content; the vast number of rural grassroots cadres have also been particularly busy and hardworking. This year, there are many good experiences that should be summarized and promoted, and at the same time, there are many errors and shortcomings that urgently need to be checked and overcome. Shanxi Province has decided that the rectification of the cooperative and the Party in rural areas this winter and next spring should start with checking and summarizing work, which is absolutely necessary.

　　The basic spirit of the rectification of the cooperative and the Party should first of all be to protect the socialist enthusiasm of cadres and the masses well, rather than to attack or damage it. Simple criticism, even punishment, is very easy, but it is not beneficial. It is not so easy to absorb experience and lessons and improve understanding and awareness through rectification work; however, only by doing so can we promote the victorious advancement of various rural tasks.

    从总结工作入手
    1956年快要过去了。这一年的农村工作，发展非常迅速，内容十分丰富；广大的农村基层干部也特别紧张和辛苦。这一年间，有许多好的经验应当总结和推广，同时也有不少错误和缺点急待检查和克服。山西省已经决定今冬明春农村的整社和整党工作从检查总结工作入手，这是完全必要的。
    整社和整党的基本精神，首先应该是很好地保护干部和群众的社会主义积极性，而不是打击它，损伤它。简单的批评以至处分，是很容易的，但是并没有什么好处。通过整顿工作吸取经验教训，提高认识和觉悟，是不那么容易的；可是，只有这样做，才能推动农村的各项工作胜利前进。
