The Soviet government's declaration on October 30 regarding the basis for developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is a document of great significance in the current international situation. This declaration is a powerful contribution to further consolidating the unity of socialist countries, promoting the common economic upsurge of socialist countries, and strengthening the struggle of the people of socialist countries against the forces of imperialist aggression. The Government of the People's Republic of China has already issued a statement on November 1 expressing its support for the Soviet government's declaration. Newspapers in European people's democratic countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia have also widely praised this declaration.

The solidarity of the socialist countries, headed by the great Soviet Union, is the most important pillar of the world's cause of peace and the cause of human progress. Due to the consistency of their ideological foundation and their goals of struggle, socialist countries have formed an unprecedented brotherly relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation. It is precisely because of this brotherly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation of socialist countries that some countries that were originally economically backward and subjected to imperialist plunder and oppression have been able to break away from the shackles of imperialism and achieve rapid development. In this regard, the Soviet Union's multifaceted and enormous assistance to other fraternal countries and peoples has played the most significant role. The internationalist solidarity of socialist countries, their common economic upsurge, and their common firm stance in maintaining world peace and opposing imperialist aggression have made the imperialists' new war plans encounter serious difficulties and filled the working people and progressive forces around the world with confidence in the future. Therefore, doing everything possible to consolidate and strengthen the unity of socialist countries is the sacred duty of socialist countries to the interests of their own people and the interests of all mankind.

The socialist cause is a new cause in human history. All new undertakings are inevitably prone to errors of one kind or another due to lack of experience. The situation is no exception in the relations between socialist countries; this is not surprising. However, socialist countries are the opposite of capitalist countries: First, although socialist countries have made mistakes in their mutual relations, they have much greater achievements, which have helped socialist countries achieve rapid social and economic progress and will make even greater social and economic progress possible in the future; second, the errors in the relations between socialist countries are all correctable and eliminable, and in fact, the errors that have occurred in the past have either been corrected or are being corrected. Therefore, this situation must not be used as an excuse to break the unity of socialist countries, nor must it be used as an excuse to break the friendship with the Soviet Union. The Soviet government's declaration of October 30 indicates that the Soviet Union is unconditionally loyal to the common interests of the great unity of socialist countries, and loyal to the Marxist-Leninist principles of national equality and proletarian internationalism. This correct attitude of the Soviet government, which places the interests of the unity of socialist countries above all else, should be the common attitude of socialist countries when considering issues of mutual relations.

As weapons for consolidating the unity of socialist countries, there are not only the socialist economic and political systems of socialist countries, not only the internationalist principles of the working class and the Marxist-Leninist principles of the working-class parties of socialist countries, but also various treaties and agreements of the countries concerned. The Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed in Warsaw on May 14, 1955 by Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia (the representative of the Government of the People's Republic of China participated in the Warsaw Conference as an observer and declared its full support and cooperation) is of particular importance for the consolidation of the socialist camp. The Warsaw Treaty guarantees that the people of European socialist countries can safely build their own beautiful future lives without being isolated and helpless in the face of the aggressive forces of Western imperialism, and guarantees that the socialist camp will not be broken one by one by Western imperialism and the counter-revolutionary forces of various countries who have always hated the socialist system, have always conspired to subvert socialist countries, and attempted to realize the capitalist and fascist counter-revolutionary restoration in socialist countries. Under the conditions that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is preparing for imperialist wars, continues to exist, the Warsaw Treaty must continue to exist. It is not only a guarantee for the security of European socialist countries, but also the most powerful guarantee for world peace as a whole.

The imperialist forces and the small number of counter-revolutionaries at home and abroad in Eastern European countries, in order to prepare for a new world war, in order to carry out capitalist and fascist restoration in Eastern European countries, are frantically carrying out anti-Soviet agitation by using various excuses and lies, because they know that as long as they leave the most powerful center of the socialist camp, the Soviet Union, it will be easier to destroy other socialist countries. They are trying their best to mislead the masses of certain countries, forcing the people of Eastern European countries to forget the profound friendship of the Soviet people who used a lot of blood in the Second World War to eliminate the Hitler occupiers, liberate the people of Eastern European countries, and then give huge economic assistance to the people of Eastern European countries. They are forcing the people of Eastern European countries to forget all the great benefits brought about by the socialist system, and to forget all the profound disasters caused by capitalism and fascism. They wantonly slander the Soviet Union, slander the communist parties of various countries, and slander the socialist principles and the Marxist-Leninist principles, in order to realize their most despicable and most vicious reactionary conspiracy. They attempt to destroy the fraternal friendship of socialist countries and destroy the Warsaw Treaty, which guarantees the common security of socialist countries. This counter-revolutionary plan of the imperialist aggressors, in coordination with their bloody offensive against the Egyptian people, constitutes a serious threat to the cause of peace and the cause of the working people in the current world. At this critical moment, all peace-loving and freedom-loving people, all peace-loving and freedom-loving youth, must maintain a high degree of vigilance! Do not let the cunning enemy realize their poisonous plan, but unite closely around the communist party, and use firmness in the socialist cause, and firmness in the principle of the unity of socialist countries, to smash the enemy's poisonous plan!

The Chinese people deeply sympathize with the experience of the Hungarian people in recent events. The hearts of the Chinese people are on the side of the kind working people of Hungary, on the side of the sincere patriots of Hungary, and on the side of the staunch socialist fighters of Hungary. There is no doubt that the mistakes made by some Hungarian leaders in their work in the past period have caused much misfortune to the Hungarian people, but the independence, freedom, and happiness of Hungary can only be realized in socialist countries. Leaving socialism means leaving a bright future, and will only bring serious disasters to the Hungarian nation. We painfully see that a very small number of counter-revolutionary conspirators are taking advantage of the situation in an attempt to carry out capitalist restoration and fascist terror in Hungary, and are attempting to open a gap in Hungary to break the unity of socialist countries and destroy the Warsaw Treaty. All peace-loving people in the world are worried about this situation, and only the vicious reactionaries are happy. But the people cannot be deceived after all. Tortuous and dangerous changes are educating the working masses of Hungary. We watch Budapest and Hungary with hope and confidence, hoping that all far-sighted, patriotic, and progressive forces in Hungary can resolutely unite, correctly lead the struggle of the masses, safeguard all the socialist achievements that the Hungarian working people have already gained in hard struggle, safeguard the People's Republic Constitution that the Hungarian people solemnly passed in 1949, and safeguard the flesh-and-blood friendship between the Hungarian people and the people of socialist countries.

The Chinese people are also keenly concerned about the vast people of other socialist countries in Eastern Europe who are building their new lives, and are concerned about the vast youth of these countries who are preparing to build new lives. The Chinese people hope that they can use the influence of comrades to help the socialist cause of Hungary, which is in a serious situation, and defend the great internationalist unity of socialist countries centered on the Soviet Union with their own active actions.

Based on its own countless painful experiences over the past century, the Chinese people deeply recognize the cunning means of imperialism and its lackeys, know that no matter what sweet words any imperialist and any of its lackeys say, including various liberal sweet words, their ultimate goal is only to suck the blood of the working people, and therefore never have any illusions about them. On the contrary, the Chinese people have found sincere and great brotherly friendship among the Soviet people and the people of other socialist countries. Therefore, the Chinese people firmly stand on the side of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The friendship between The People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union is permanently unshakable, because this friendship is related to the most fundamental interests of the eight hundred million people of the two countries, and harming this interest, other interests will inevitably suffer as a result. The Chinese people firmly believe that only by consolidating and strengthening the unity between socialist countries can the people of socialist countries move towards peace, security, and towards the only bright road of independence, freedom, and happiness. Let us shout: Long live the great unity of socialist countries!

    社会主义各国的伟大团结万岁
    苏联政府在10月30日发表的关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言，是目前国际形势下有重大意义的文件。这个宣言对于进一步巩固社会主义各国的团结，促进社会主义各国共同的经济高涨和加强社会主义各国人民反对帝国主义侵略势力的斗争，是一个有力的贡献。中华人民共和国政府已经在11月1日发表声明，对于苏联政府的宣言表示支持。欧洲的人民民主国家波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、南斯拉夫等国的报纸，对于这一宣言也普遍加以赞扬。
    以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结一致，是世界和平事业和人类进步事业的最重要的支柱。社会主义国家由于思想基础和奋斗目标的一致，形成了人类历史上前所未有的兄弟式的互助合作关系。正是由于社会主义国家的这种兄弟般的团结一致和互助合作，一些原来在经济上落后的、受帝国主义掠夺和压迫的国家才能够摆脱帝国主义的枷锁，得到了迅速的发展。在这一方面，苏联对于其他各兄弟国家和各国人民的多方面的巨大援助，起了最显著的作用。社会主义各国的国际主义团结，它们的共同的经济高涨，它们对于维护世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略的共同的坚定立场，使帝国主义的新的战争计划遇到了严重的困难，使全世界劳动人民和进步力量对于前途充满了信心。因此，尽一切力量巩固和加强社会主义各国的团结，是社会主义各国对于本国人民利益和全人类利益的崇高职责。
    社会主义事业是人类历史上的新事业。一切新事业都不免由于缺乏经验而发生这样那样的错误。在社会主义国家的相互关系方面，情形也不能例外；这是毫不奇怪的。但是社会主义国家同资本主义国家相反：第一，社会主义国家在相互关系方面虽然犯过错误，但是它们有更大得多的成绩，这些成绩帮助了社会主义各国获得了迅速的社会进步和经济进步，并且将使今后更大的社会进步和经济进步成为可能；第二，社会主义国家相互关系方面的错误都是可以改正和消除的，事实上过去所发生过的错误或者已经改正了，或者也正在改正中。因此，这种情况决不能成为破裂社会主义国家团结的口实，决不能成为破裂对于苏联的友谊的口实。苏联政府10月30日的宣言，表示苏联无条件地忠于社会主义各国伟大团结的共同利益，忠于马克思列宁主义的民族平等原则和无产阶级国际主义原则。苏联政府的这种把社会主义各国团结一致的利益看得高于一切的正确态度，应该是社会主义各国在考虑相互关系问题的时候的共同态度。
    作为巩固社会主义各国团结的武器的，不仅有社会主义各国的社会主义经济政治制度，不仅有社会主义各国工人阶级的国际主义原则和工人阶级政党的马克思列宁主义原则，而且有有关各国的各种条约和协定。1955年5月14日在华沙由阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克签订的友好合作互助条约（中华人民共和国政府代表曾以观察员身份参与华沙会议，并且声明给予完全的支持和合作），对于社会主义阵营的巩固具有特别重要的作用。华沙条约保证欧洲社会主义阵营各国的人民可以安全地建设自己的未来的美好生活，而不致在西方帝国主义侵略势力面前孤立无援，保证社会主义阵营各国不致被一贯仇视社会主义制度、一贯阴谋颠复社会主义各国、企图在社会主义各国实现资本主义的和法西斯主义的反革命复辟的西方帝国主义和各国反革命势力所各个击破。当西方帝国主义准备侵略战争的北大西洋公约继续存在的条件之下，华沙条约就必须继续存在。它不但是欧洲各社会主义国家安全的保障，而且是整个世界和平的最有力的保障。
    帝国主义势力和东欧各国国内外的少数反革命分子，为了准备新的世界大战，为了在东欧各国实行资本主义的和法西斯主义的复辟，正在利用各种借口和谎言疯狂地进行反对苏联的煽动，因为他们知道，只要离开社会主义阵营最强大的中心苏联，那么，其他社会主义国家就比较容易摧毁。他们竭力想把某些国家的群众引入迷途，硬要东欧各国人民忘记苏联人民在第二次世界大战中用大量鲜血消灭希特勒占领者、解放东欧各国人民、随后又给东欧各国人民巨大的经济援助的深厚情谊。他们硬要东欧各国人民忘记社会主义制度所带来的一切伟大利益，忘记资本主义、法西斯主义所造成的一切深重灾难。他们肆意诬蔑苏联，诬蔑各国共产党，诬蔑社会主义原则和马克思列宁主义原则，以便实现他们的最卑鄙最凶恶的反动阴谋。他们企图摧毁社会主义各国的兄弟友谊，摧毁保障社会主义各国共同安全的华沙条约。帝国主义侵略者的这个反革命计划，同他们对于埃及人民的血腥进攻互相配合，构成了对于当前世界的和平事业和劳动人民事业的严重威胁。在这个严重的时刻，一切爱好和平和自由的人民，一切爱好和平和自由的青年，必须保持高度的警惕！不要让狡猾的敌人实现他们的毒计，而要紧密团结在共产主义政党的周围，用对于社会主义事业的坚定性，用对于社会主义各国团结一致原则的坚定性，粉碎敌人的毒计！
    中国人民深深同情匈牙利人民在最近的事件中的遭遇。中国人民的心是在匈牙利善良的劳动人民方面，是在匈牙利的真诚的爱国者方面，是在匈牙利的坚贞的社会主义战士方面。毫无疑问，匈牙利的一些领导者在过去时期的工作中所犯的错误给匈牙利人民造成了许多不幸，但是匈牙利的独立、自由、幸福却只能在社会主义国家中实现，离开了社会主义也就离开了光明的未来，就只能为匈牙利民族招来严重的灾难。我们痛心地看到，极少数反革命阴谋家正在利用局势，企图在匈牙利实行资本主义复辟和法西斯恐怖，企图从匈牙利打开破裂社会主义国家团结、破坏华沙条约的缺口。对于这种情形，全世界爱好和平的人民都感到忧虑，只有凶恶的反动派才感到高兴。但是人民究竟是不能蒙蔽的。曲折的和危险的变化教育着匈牙利的劳动群众。我们满怀希望和信心注视着布达佩斯和匈牙利全国，希望匈牙利的一切有远见的爱国的进步的力量能够坚决地团结起来，正确地领导群众的斗争，维护匈牙利劳动人民在艰苦斗争中所已经获得的一切社会主义成果，维护匈牙利人民在1949年所庄严地通过了的人民共和国宪法，维护匈牙利人民同社会主义各国人民之间的情同骨肉的友谊。
    中国人民也殷切地关怀着东欧其他社会主义国家的建设着自己的新生活的广大人民，关怀着这些国家的准备建设新生活的广大青年。中国人民希望他们能够以同志的影响帮助处在严重状况下的匈牙利的社会主义事业，并且以自己的积极行动捍卫以苏联为中心的社会主义各国的伟大的国际主义团结。
    中国人民根据自己百年来的无数惨痛经验，深切地认识了帝国主义及其走狗的狡猾手段，知道任何帝国主义者及其任何走狗无论口头上说什么花言巧语，包括各种自由主义的花言巧语在内，他们的最后的目的就只是要吸尽劳动人民的鲜血，因而对于他们决不抱任何幻想。相反，中国人民在苏联人民和其他社会主义国家人民中间却找到了真诚的伟大的兄弟友谊。因此，中国人民坚决地站在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营方面。中华人民共和国同苏联的友谊是永久不可动摇的，因为这个友谊关系着两国八亿人口的最根本的利益，危害了这个利益，其他的利益也就必然要随着遭受危害。中国人民坚信，只有巩固和加强社会主义各国之间的团结，才是社会主义各国人民走向和平、安全，走向独立、自由、幸福的唯一光明道路。让我们高呼：社会主义各国的伟大团结万岁！
