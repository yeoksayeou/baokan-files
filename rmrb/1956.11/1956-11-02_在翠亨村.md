    In Cuiheng Village
    By Our Correspondent Lin Li
    From Guangzhou, a three-and-a-half-hour bus ride takes you to Zhongshan County. Then, along the highway leading to Macau, another twenty-eight kilometers brings you to Cuiheng Village, the hometown of our great Chinese thinker and democratic revolutionary, Mr. Sun Yat-sen.
    Surrounded by mountains and lush forests, the scenery here is extremely beautiful. As you approach Cuiheng Village, you'll see a towering banyan tree on the east side of the main road, proudly standing in front of an ordinary residence. The courtyard gate of this residence is low and short, making the seven large characters above the doorway very eye-catching: "Sun Yat-sen's Former Residence." It was here that the great Mr. Sun Yat-sen was born on November 12, 1866.
    The residence is not large, with earthen walls only about six feet high, but they look like they're made of cement, a testament to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's labor alongside the bricklayers. Inside the courtyard, there is a well and a magnolia tree. There is also a tamarind tree that Mr. Sun Yat-sen transplanted from Southeast Asia when he was twenty years old.
    Shortly after Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925, this tree was blown down by a storm, and its branches and leaves gradually turned yellow and withered. After liberation, the People's Government sent people to support the trunk with stone pillars, and the branches and leaves gradually flourished again. Now, the tree is laden with fruit, as delightful as the magnolia tree beside it.
    The only building in the courtyard is a two-story building with three rooms on each floor and a corridor. It is said that the people of Cuiheng Village generally build houses facing east, otherwise misfortune will befall them. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who accepted advanced ideas, did not believe in this superstition and insisted on building this building facing west. The building also imitated Western styles, with seven arched doorways, making it very unique. Because of this, the locals called it the "Foreign Building."
    Inside, the "Foreign Building" is a standard Chinese style. The middle room is the main room, with two side rooms on the left and right. The main room is furnished as it was in the old days, with chairs, stools, and tea tables neatly arranged on both sides. The north side room was originally the bedroom of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and his wife. Two portraits, hung by Mr. Sun Yat-sen himself, still hang on the north wall. The old-fashioned large bed that Mr. Sun Yat-sen used is still placed against the east wall in its original state. The medical bed, stethoscope, and tables and stools that Mr. Sun Yat-sen used when he practiced medicine are also well-preserved in their original places.
    On the walls of the main room and the south side room, photographs, copies, or transcripts of documents relating to Mr. Sun Yat-sen are hung in chronological order. These outline Mr. Sun Yat-sen's glorious and great life and also reflect, in fragments, the history of the Chinese revolution during this period. The photo display in the main room begins with Comrade Mao Zedong's overall evaluation of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's historical role. This evaluation is copied in golden regular script on a red paper and framed with glass. The original text is: "Mr. Sun Yat-sen is great not only because he led the great Xinhai Revolution (although it was a democratic revolution of the old period), but also because he was able to 'adapt to the world's trends and meet the needs of the people,' put forward the three major revolutionary policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, gave a new interpretation to the Three People's Principles, and established the new Three People's Principles of the three major policies."
    Following this evaluation are scenes from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's school days. Here are a photo of Mr. Sun Yat-sen at the age of eighteen, a photocopy of his diploma from the University of Hong Kong, a photo of the English books awarded to him by the King of Hawaii, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen's medical instruments and advertising photos.
    The cultural relics reflecting Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary activities begin with his initiation of the founding of the Xingzhonghui (Revive China Society). Here are fragments of photos of the Xingzhonghui Declaration, the draft of the General Charter of the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League), and the Provisional Constitution, as well as photos of Mr. Sun Yat-sen taking office as the President. Noteworthy is the photo of Lu Haodong after his martyrdom. In the revolutionary struggle led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Lu Haodong was the first person to sacrifice for the revolution and was also a native of Cuiheng Village.
    In this section of cultural relics, there are also photos reflecting Mr. Sun Yat-sen's leadership of the Xinhai Revolution.
    The photographs displayed in the south side room mainly reflect the changes in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thinking in the later period of the revolution. Here are photos of him serving as Grand Marshal of the Army and Navy, copies and clippings of orders, photos of him being elected as Extraordinary President, photos of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and his wife Soong Ching-ling, and copies of letters written to the Soviet government. During this period, Mr. Sun Yat-sen experienced the pain of "having the name of a republic without the reality of a republic." He had been searching for the correct direction to lead the Chinese revolution until the Soviet envoy Joffe came to China and made contact with the Chinese Communists, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen found this direction. He put forward the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, enriched the Three People's Principles, and reorganized the Kuomintang organizationally. Now on display here are excerpts from the Kuomintang Reorganization Declaration, the Kuomintang's First National Congress, and the amended Party Constitution and Program.
    Also excerpted here is a manuscript of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's speech at the "Peasant Movement Training Institute" on "Tillers Should Have Their Own Land." From here, we can see that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's policy of "assisting peasants and workers" was not only a theoretical understanding but also his true feelings. In this speech, he said: "The peasants are the largest majority of the Chinese people. If the peasants do not participate in the revolution, then our revolution has no foundation. This reorganization of the Kuomintang, to join the peasant movement, is to use the peasants as the foundation. We want the peasants to be the foundation of our party's revolution." Therefore, he continued, only if the peasant movement is done well, "can our foundation be consolidated. Our revolution can succeed. If this foundation cannot be consolidated, our revolution will fail."
    During this period, Mr. Sun Yat-sen also gave speeches on the workers' movement and speeches on women's issues. He had long had relations with the leading organs of the workers' movement—the trade unions. Here is a photo of a receipt that reads: "Received three thousand yuan in assistance from the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions." The date is October 21, 1922. It is clear that he had an understanding of the working class. There was also a certain material foundation as a background. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's "alliance with Russia" policy can be seen from the grief expressed at the death of Lenin. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen heard the news of Lenin's death, he immediately ordered the national flag to be flown at half-mast. When he gave a speech at the memorial service for Lenin, he adopted a solemn national form—a white carpet was laid at his feet, and all government officials stood behind him. Now, displayed here is a photo of him standing on a white carpet giving a speech and a photo of the flag being flown at half-mast. His grief looks so sincere and touching.
    After Mr. Sun Yat-sen completed the task of reorganizing the Kuomintang, he accepted Mr. Feng Yuxiang's invitation to leave Guangdong for the north to discuss national construction plans. Unexpectedly, he became bedridden in Tianjin. A photo of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in Tianjin serves as proof of this historical period. Then, there are photos of Mr. Sun Yat-sen moving from Tianjin to Beijing, living in Tieshizi Hutong to recuperate, as well as excerpts from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's letter to the Soviet government while he was ill, and photos of the funeral and mourning at his residence in Tieshizi Hutong after his death, and photos of the transfer of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's coffin to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing four years later.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen died, but his call for "peaceful struggle to save China" has become a signal for national action. In this exhibition, there are photos of the vigorous Northern Expedition, film clips of the three great revolutionary stages experienced by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party after the Chiang Kai-shek clique betrayed the revolution, and finally a shot of Chairman Mao Zedong standing on Tiananmen Square in Beijing announcing the founding of the People's Republic of China. That is to say, the independent, free, and prosperous new China that Mr. Sun Yat-sen pursued throughout his life was completed by the Chinese Communist Party leading the people of the whole country.
    Leaving Sun Yat-sen's former residence and turning around, you will find the office of the Cuiheng Collective Farm. Lin Qiaoling, a staff member of the Cuiheng District, found He Runfang, the head of the farm, and Feng Dabao, the secretary of the branch, to introduce me to excerpts of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's materials and the situation of the farm.
    There were originally three families with the surname Sun in Cuiheng Village, all of whom were relatives of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The ancestors of the Sun family were originally in Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, but when they moved to Cuiheng Village is no longer known. The three households in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's time have also moved elsewhere. Mr. Sun Yat-sen spent his childhood in Cuiheng Village, but rarely returned home afterward. He returned once in 1913, and the villagers thought he had brought gold and silver treasures, but the answer he got was: "I don't have anything. What I brought back is revolutionary thought." Mr. Sun Yat-sen did not live in Cuiheng Village for a long time, but he liked this place very much and also liked the people of Cuiheng Village.
    What is Cuiheng Village, which Mr. Sun Yat-sen cared about, like now? Not only has the realization of "tillers have their own land" that Mr. Sun Yat-sen pursued been realized, but also, a step further, on March 12 this year, the anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the peasants of Cuiheng Village united with the peasants of nearby Changshapu, Zhutouyuan, Pingding Village, and Xiasha Village to establish the Cuiheng Collective Farm. The early rice harvest of the Cuiheng Collective Farm this year increased by 68% compared to last year's early rice. In addition, the farm also owns a large truck and a rice milling machine with twenty-five horsepower. There are one hundred and eighty-one cattle on the pasture and thirty-six kinds of sideline businesses. He Runfang and others are most interested in the rice milling machine. They said that the rice milling machine can be converted into a small generator and can also be converted into a water pump. This spring, there was a fairly serious drought here. Because the water was pumped by this rice milling machine converted into a water pump, all the rice fields were irrigated, resulting in a higher harvest than last year. ... Hearing these simple narratives, I thought to myself: If Mr. Sun Yat-sen were still alive, if Mr. Sun Yat-sen came to Cuiheng Village at such a moment, he would say with a smile:
    Fellow villagers! Collective farmers! I congratulate you! ...
    Standing at the south entrance of Cuiheng Village, looking north through the lush and magnificent trees, you will find a huge palace-like building at the foot of Plow Tip Mountain. This classical palace building is the "Sun Yat-sen Memorial Middle School" founded to commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen.
    The main buildings of the Memorial Middle School have five halls. They are divided into three layers, forming a trapezoid. The highest layer is called "Yixian Hall," which is a two-story building with flying eaves and corners. The top of the building is covered with emerald blue glazed tiles. The middle and lower layers each have two high-rise buildings, standing in front of the "Yixian Hall," like the wings or arms of the "Yixian Hall." Standing in the high-rise building on the east side of the middle level is called "Qingling Hall," which was originally a girls' dormitory and is now used as a classroom and science instrument laboratory. The building on the west side is called "Heling Hall," which is to commemorate another revolutionary from Cuiheng Village, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's comrade-in-arms Yang Heling, and contains classrooms. The two high-rise buildings on the bottom layer are called "Shouping Hall" and "Haodong Hall." The former is to commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen's eldest brother, and the latter is to commemorate the famous general who died for the country during the Guangzhou Uprising.
    The construction area of the Memorial Middle School was originally eight thousand square meters, and another two thousand and three hundred square meters have been added in recent years. It has its own electricity, running water, and power generation equipment. It can be said to be one of the best-equipped middle schools in China. Now, all the teachers and students of the school are commemorating the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth with practical actions of hard work and study.

    在翠亨村
    本报记者　林里
    从广州出发，坐三个半钟头的汽车，到中山县城。再沿着通往澳门的公路，前进二十八公里，就到了我们伟大祖国的思想家、民主主义革命家孙中山先生的故乡——翠亨村。
    这里群山环抱，林木蓊郁，风景十分优美。直朝翠亨村走去，你会看见，大道东侧有一棵高不可攀的榕树，傲然屹立在一幢普通住宅的门前。这住宅的院门又低又矮，显得门楣上的七个大字非常醒目：“孙中山先生故居”。1866年11月12日，伟大的中山先生就诞生在这里。
    宅院不大，土墙头不过六尺高，看去却像水泥筑成的，这是中山先生和泥瓦匠一起劳动的成绩。院里一口井，一棵玉兰花树。还有一棵酸子树，是中山先生二十岁那年，从南洋移植过来的。
    1925年孙中山先生逝世后不久，这棵树被一阵风暴吹得倒了下来，后来枝叶逐渐枯黄。解放后，人民政府派人用石柱将树干托住，枝叶又逐渐茂盛起来，现在满树果实累累，跟旁边的玉兰花树一样惹人喜爱。
    院内的房屋建筑只有一幢楼房，分两层，上下各三间，有走廊。据说，翠亨村的人们盖房子，一般都是坐西朝东，否则就有祸害临门之虞。接受了先进思想的中山先生不信这一套，偏偏盖了这幢坐东朝西的楼房。楼房上下，又仿照西方形式，筑了七个穹形门楼，样子十分别致。因为这些，当地人管它叫“洋楼”。
    洋楼里面，却是标准的中国形式。当中一间正房，左右两个耳房。正房陈设依然像当年一样，椅凳茶几，整齐地摆在两边。北耳房原是中山先生及其夫人的卧室。北墙上依旧挂着先生自己挂上的两张像片。先生当年用过的古式大床，还原封原样的靠在东墙根。先生当年行医用过的病床、听诊器和桌凳，还完好的保留在原地。
    正房和南耳房的墙壁上，依着编年次序，挂着中山先生的照片、文件副本或抄本。这些，概括了中山先生光荣而伟大的一生，也片断地反映了这个时期的中国革命的历史。正房的照片陈列，是从毛泽东同志对中山先生的历史作用的总评价开始的。这段评语用金色楷书，抄录在一张红纸上，又用玻璃装了起来。原文是：“孙中山先生之所以伟大，不但因为他领导了伟大的辛亥革命（虽然是旧时期的民主革命），而且因为他能够‘适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要’，提出了联俄、联共、扶助农工三大革命政策，对三民主义作了新的解释，树立了三大政策的新三民主义。”
    接着这段评语，是中山先生求学时期的情景。这里有先生十八岁时的照片，有在香港大学的毕业证书的副照，有夏威夷国王奖给他英文书籍的照片，还有先生行医时的用具、广告照等。
    反映中山先生革命活动的文物，是从先生发起成立兴中会开始的。这里有兴中会宣言、中国同盟会总章草案、临时约法等等的片断照片，有先生就职大总统的照片。引人注意的是陆皓东殉难后的照片。在中山先生领导的革命斗争中，陆皓东是为革命牺牲的第一人，也是翠亨村人。
    在这部分文物中，还有反映先生领导辛亥革命的照片。
    南耳房里陈列的照片，主要反映了中山先生革命后期的思想变化。这里有他充任陆海军大元帅的照片、命令的副本和剪报，有被选为非常大总统的照片，还有先生同夫人宋庆龄的合影，有写给苏联政府的信的抄本。这一时期，中山先生经历了“有民国之名，无民国之实”的苦恼，他一直去找寻领导中国革命的正确方向，直到苏联特使越飞来华，跟中国共产党人发生了关系，中山先生才找到了这个方向。提出了联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策，充实了三民主义，并从组织上改组了国民党。现在陈列在这里的，有国民党改组宣言、国民党第一次全国代表大会、修改后的党章党纲的片断照片。
    这里还摘录一段中山先生在“农民运动讲习所”所讲“耕者要有其田”的讲稿。从这里，我们可以看到，中山先生的“扶助农工”的政策，不仅是理论上的认识，而且是他的真情实感。他在这篇演讲中说：“农民是我们中国人民之中的最大多数。如果农民不来参加革命。就是我们革命没有基础。国民党这次改组。要加入农民运动。就是要用农民来做基础。要农民来做本党革命的基础。”因此，他继续说，只有做好了农民运动，“我们的基础可以巩固。我们的革命便可以成功。如果这种基础不能巩固。我们的革命便要失败。”
    这时期，中山先生也做过关于工人运动的讲演，关于妇女问题的讲演。他同工人运动的领导机关——工会，早已发生了关系。这里有一张收款字据的照片，上面写着：“收到香港总工会助款三千元正。”时间是1922年10月21日。可见他对于工人阶级的认识。也有一定的物质基础做背景，中山先生的“联俄”政策，可以从列宁逝世时所表现的悲痛心情中看出。中山先生听到列宁逝世的消息，立即命令全国下半旗致哀。他在追悼列宁的大会上发表演说时，采取了庄严的民族形式——，脚下铺了白毯，所有政府官员都站在后面。现在，这里就陈列了他站在白毯上发表演讲的照片和下半旗致哀的照片。他那悲痛的心情，显得那么真切而感人。
    中山先生完成了改组国民党的任务之后，应了冯玉祥先生的邀请离粤北上，借以商讨建国大计。不料，行至天津即卧床不起。先生在天津时的照片，作了这段历史的证明。随后，是先生从天津迁往北京，住在铁狮子胡同养病的照片，还有先生在病中致苏联政府书的文字摘录，以及先生死后，铁狮子胡同住所治丧致哀时的照片和四年后将中山先生灵柩移往南京中山陵的照片等。
    中山先生死了，他那“和平奋斗救中国”的呼唤，却变成了举国行动的信号。在这部陈列物中，有轰轰烈烈的北伐战争时的照片，有蒋介石集团叛变革命后，全国人民在中国共产党领导下经历了三次伟大革命阶段的片断剪影，最后是毛泽东主席站在北京天安门上，宣布中华人民共和国成立的镜头。就是说，中山先生毕生追求的独立、自由和繁荣的新中国，是由中国共产党领导全国人民完成的。
    从中山故居出来，往后一转，便是翠亨集体农庄的办公室。翠亨区的工作人员林乔龄，找来农庄主任何润芳、支部书记冯大保，给我介绍了中山先生的片断材料和农庄情形。
    翠亨村原有三家姓孙的，都是中山先生的家人。孙家的祖先原在广东省东莞县，什么时候迁来翠亨村，已经无从查知。中山先生时代的三户人家，也都早已迁往别处。中山先生在翠亨村度过了他的童年，往后就很少回家。1913年回来过一次，乡亲们以为他带来了金银财宝，但得到的回答是：“我什么东西也没有。带回来的只是革命思想。”中山先生在翠亨村住的时间不多，但他非常喜欢这个地方，也很喜欢翠亨村的人民。
    先生关怀过的翠亨村现在怎样呢？不但实现了先生追求的耕者有其田，而且更进了一步，于今年3月12日孙中山先生逝世纪念日，翠亨村的农民联合了附近的长沙埔、竹头园、平顶村和下沙村的农民，成立了翠亨集体农庄。翠亨集体农庄今年早稻收成，比去年的早稻增产68％。此外，农庄还拥有大卡车一辆，二十五匹马力的碾米机一台。牧场里有一百八十一头牛，还有三十六种副业。何润芳等人最感兴趣的是碾米机。他们说，碾米机可以改装成小型发电机，还可以改装成抽水机。今年春天，这里本来遭受了相当严重的旱灾。因为有这台碾米机改成的抽水机抽水，全部稻田得到了灌溉，结果就得到了比去年还要高的收成。……听到这些朴素的叙述，我心里想：要是中山先生还活着的话，要是中山先生也在这样的时刻，来翠亨村看看的话，他一定会满怀笑容地说：
    乡亲们！集体农民们！我向你们祝贺！……
    站在翠亨村的南口，透过那青葱而壮丽的树林向北望去，你会发觉犁头尖的山下，有一座宫殿式的巨大建筑。这座古典式的宫殿建筑，就是为纪念中山先生而创办的“中山纪念中学”。
    纪念中学的主要建筑有五座殿堂。分三层，成梯形。最高一层叫“逸仙堂”，是个有着飞檐楼角的两层高楼。楼顶上盖着翠蓝色的琉璃瓦。中层和下层各有两幢高楼，分立在“逸仙堂”的前方，又像是“逸仙堂”的两翼或两臂。站在中层靠东的高楼，叫“庆龄堂”，原是女生宿舍，现在作了教室和科学仪器试验室。靠西边的那一幢，叫“鹤龄堂”，是为纪念翠亨村的另一革命家，中山先生的战友杨鹤龄的，里面是教室。最下层的两幢高楼，一叫“寿屏堂”，一叫“皓东堂”。前者是纪念中山先生的大哥，后者是纪念广州起义时为国捐躯的名将。
    纪念中学的建筑面积原有八千平方公尺，这几年来又增建了二千三百平方公尺。拥有自己的电灯、自来水和发电设备。可说是我国设备最好的中学之一。现在，全校师生正以努力工作、学习的实际行动来纪念中山先生的九十周年诞辰。
