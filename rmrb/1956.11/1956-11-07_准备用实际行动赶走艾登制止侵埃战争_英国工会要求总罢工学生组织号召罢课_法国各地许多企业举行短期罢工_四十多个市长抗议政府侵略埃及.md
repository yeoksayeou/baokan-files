    Preparing to use practical actions to drive away Eden and stop the war of aggression against Egypt
    British trade unions demand general strike, student organizations call for strikes
    Short-term strikes held in many enterprises throughout France; more than forty mayors protest against the government's invasion of Egypt
    Xinhua News Agency, London, 6th. More and more workers and trade union members throughout Britain are demanding a general strike to force Eden to resign and stop the Anglo-French war of aggression in Egypt.
    On November 5, the Fire Brigades Union demanded a general strike. The shop stewards committee of the London Port Shipbuilders and Mechanical Engineering Workers Union Federation, representing thousands of ship repair workers, called on the union council to use its strike power.
    Many large trade unions and trade union regional committees pledged on November 5 to support the movement launched by the Labour Party National Committee under the slogan "Law, not war".
    Students, who have played an important role in the fight against the war, are also demanding strikes. The Asian-African Students Liaison Committee, representing approximately 10,000 students from nineteen British student organizations, has called for a one-day strike on November 7.
    Eighty Oxford University students protested to members of parliament in the central lobby of the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 5th regarding the government's policy in Egypt.
    A petition signed by approximately one thousand Birmingham students calling for an end to the war will be delivered to the university's honorary president, Eden.
    Students from the Universities of Liverpool and Nottingham, as well as the London School of Economics, also petitioned members of parliament on the 5th, demanding an end to the aggression against Egypt.
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th. TASS, Paris, 5th: Enterprises in Paris and the provinces of Seine-Maritime, Moselle, Nord, and other places held short strikes on November 3, with strikers demanding that the government immediately cease its armed aggression against Egypt and that French troops return home.
    A delegation of French youth also went to the Prime Minister's office to make similar demands. More than forty mayors of the department of Dordogne issued a joint statement protesting against the government's adoption of "military actions incompatible with French traditions and interests".
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Paris dispatch: A report released by the European Economic Cooperation Bureau on the 5th warned that France must control its inflation, otherwise the French economy will face a more serious "imbalance."
    The report pointed out that France is currently experiencing "severe inflation," with prices spiraling upward. The report also pointed out that the poor harvest of agricultural products caused by the severe cold last winter, the shrinking labor market, and the government's huge military expenses in North Africa have all worsened France's economic situation.
    The European Economic Cooperation Bureau made this analysis after investigating France's economic situation during the eighteen months ending June 30, 1956.

    准备用实际行动赶走艾登制止侵埃战争
    英国工会要求总罢工学生组织号召罢课
    法国各地许多企业举行短期罢工　四十多个市长抗议政府侵略埃及
    据新华社伦敦6日电　英国各地越来越多的工人和工会会员要求举行总罢工来迫使艾登辞职和制止英法在埃及的侵略战争。
    11月5日，消防队员工会要求举行总罢工。代表成千修船工人的伦敦港造船工人及机械工业工人工会联合会车间代表委员会号召工会理事会使用它的罢工力量。
    许多大工会和工会区域委员会5日保证支持工党全国委员会在“要法律，不要战争”的口号下发动的运动。
    在反对战争的斗争中起了重要作用的学生们也要求罢课。代表十九个英国学生组织中约一万个学生的亚非学生联系委员会已经号召在11月7日罢课一天。
    八十个牛津大学学生5日下午在下院中央休息室就政府在埃及的政策向议员们表示抗议。
    由大约一千个伯明翰学生签名呼吁制止战争的请愿书将交给大学名誉校长艾登。
    利物浦和诺丁汉的大学以及伦敦经济学院的学生们5日也向议员们请愿，要求制止对埃及的侵略。
    据新华社6日讯　塔斯社巴黎5日讯：巴黎和尼罗河口省、摩塞尔省、诺尔省及其他地方的企业11月3日举行了短时间的罢工，罢工者要求政府立即停止武装侵略埃及，并且要求法国军队回国。
    法国青年代表团也到总理办公厅去提出类似的要求。多顿涅省四十多个市长发表了联合声明，抗议政府采取“同法国传统和利益不相容的军事行动”。
    据新华社6日讯　巴黎消息：欧洲经济合作局5日发表的报告警告说，法国必须控制它的通货膨胀，否则法国经济将面临更严重的“不平衡”。
    报告指出，法国目前存在着“严重的通货膨胀”，物价在盘旋上升。报告还指出，去年冬季酷寒所造成的农产品歉收，劳动市场的萎缩和政府在北非浩大的军事费用，都使得法国的经济情况恶化。
    欧洲经济合作局是在调查了截至1956年6月底为止的十八个月中法国经济情况之后，作出这个分析的。
