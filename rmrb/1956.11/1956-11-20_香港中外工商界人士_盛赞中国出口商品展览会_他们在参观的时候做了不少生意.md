Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 16th: More than sixty Hong Kong businessmen and foreign merchants who participated in the Chinese Export Commodities Fair told those who welcomed them upon their return to Hong Kong yesterday that their trip to Guangzhou had been "very rewarding."

Wang Kuancheng, Vice Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Importers' and Exporters' Association and Standing Committee Member of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said upon his return to Hong Kong on the 15th that the fair was very large, and the commodities on display were numerous and exquisite. After the visit, everyone felt it was a feast for the eyes. He said: The Chinese and foreign businessmen participating in this exhibition have gained a great deal and have done a lot of business. A cloth factory in Hong Kong did more than six million Hong Kong dollars worth of business at the fair, and a company also did more than six million Hong Kong dollars worth of business.

Lin Chengchi, a director of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said: The Hong Kong and Kowloon Fujian businessmen made more than 10 million Hong Kong dollars worth of business shortly after the opening of the exhibition. Everyone at the exhibition praised the domestic goods. Many people who have made business deals have returned to Hong Kong and plan to go to Guangzhou again to do business.

Mr. Eimanz, manager of a British company, said that he visited the Commodities Fair for two days, ordered a batch of knitted handbags for women, and brought back some textile samples and price lists for consideration. He said that the quality of these textiles is very good and they will definitely have a market in the UK. Mr. Eimanz said that the scale of the exhibition is comparable to other commodity exhibitions held around the world. Another Swedish import merchant, Mr. Jonker, also believes that this exhibition is comparable to any other exhibition of the same nature in other countries.

    香港中外工商界人士
    盛赞中国出口商品展览会
    他们在参观的时候做了不少生意
    新华社广州16日电　参加中国出口商品展览会的香港工商界人士和外国商人六十多人昨天回到香港时，对欢迎者说，他们这次到广州“收获很大”。
    香港中华出入口商会副理事长、中华总商会常董王宽诚15日回到香港时说，展览会的场面非常大，展出的商品种类很多，都很精美。参观后，大家都认为美不胜收。他说：参加这次展览会的中外工商界人士都有极大的收获，都作了不少生意。香港的一家布厂在展览会上做了六百多万元港币生意，有一家公司也做了港币六百多万元生意。
    中华总商会会董林诚致说：这次福建籍的港九工商界在展览会开幕不久，就做了一千多万元港币的生意。大家在展览会上看见国产商品都赞不绝口。有不少做成生意的人回到香港后，还打算再赴广州做生意。
    一家英国公司的经理伊曼组说，他在商品展览会参观了两天，订购了一批女用的针织手袋，还带回一些纺织品的样品和价目表回来考虑。他说，这些纺织品的质地很好，在英国一定有销路。伊曼组说，展览会的展出规模，可以和世界各地举行的其他商品展览会媲美。另外一位瑞典进口商人容克也认为这个展览会可以和任何一个其他国家的同样性质的展览会相比。
