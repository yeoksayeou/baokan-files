    Xinhua News Agency, London, 15th: Nadin, a Conservative who recently resigned from his positions as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and British Representative to the United Nations, announced on the 14th that he was giving up his position as a Conservative Member of Parliament.
    Nadin, who is only thirty-six years old and was once a capable assistant to Eden in foreign affairs, has stated that he could no longer defend the government's position in Parliament because he disagreed with the government's policy towards Egypt.
    In a letter notifying the Conservative organization in his constituency of Midleton (in Leicestershire) of this decision, Nadin expressed his dissatisfaction with the Conservative organization in this constituency for continuing to support the Eden government's policies.

    不满英保守党政府政策
    纳丁宣布退出议会
    新华社15日讯　伦敦消息：刚刚辞去英国外交部国务大臣和英国驻联合国代表职务的保守党人纳丁又在14日宣布，他放弃作为保守党议员的职务。
    这个年仅三十六岁的、曾经是艾登在外交事务上的得力助手的纳丁宣布过，由于他不同意政府对埃及采取的政策，他不可能再在议会里维护政府的立场。
    纳丁在把这一决定通知他所属的选区密尔敦（在列斯特郡）的保守党组织的信件中，对于这个选区的保守党组织继续支持艾登政府的政策表示不满。
