Xinhua News Agency, 21st. Xinhua News Agency reporter Lu Gongmin reports: After Beijing relaxed market management, the quantity and variety of agricultural and sideline products sold by farmers in the city, such as vermicelli, sweet potatoes, vegetables, brooms, willow grass woven items, chicks, aquatic products, and eggs, have increased significantly compared to the past. On average, 6,000 chicks are brought to market every day, and some farmers even sell them on the streets and in alleys, which is welcomed by urban residents. The quality of the goods is generally also better, and the amount of vegetables on the market at the Tianqiao vegetable station has increased by two or three times compared to the past.

With the expansion of urban-rural trade, a new problem worthy of attention has also emerged: farmers entering the city are gradually turning into commercial peddlers. When they first enter the city, they still bring some small local products from the countryside, but after selling them, they do not return, instead setting up stalls and pushing carts to do business and make money. A considerable number of farmers even come empty-handed, living in the city to buy and sell locally, profiting from the difference. These farmers stay in the farmer service centers for ten days, half a month, or even a month or two. The four farmer service centers in the urban and suburban areas are often filled with five or six thousand farmers and peddlers. There are also some farmers without accommodation who push carts and carry burdens to sell along the streets during the day, and sleep on the streets at night, making everywhere their home.

Because these farmers entering the city are unmanaged, especially lacking organized trading venues, their trafficking is highly speculative. They once set up dozens of large pots outside Guang'anmen to fry the wet peanuts they collected from the suburbs every day, and then distributed them to hundreds of farmers to set up stalls in the city and sell them at high prices. Some farmers' commercial activities are organized collectively by agricultural producers' cooperatives. The deputy director of the Xusheng Agricultural Production Cooperative of Dawu Township in Anxin County, Hebei Province, led 150 cooperative members to live in Beijing for a long time to sell scrap copper. Every day, they went to the suburbs to buy scrap copper at a price about twice as high as the state's purchase price, and then sold it to the city's joint public-private small iron factories and handicraft production cooperatives at even higher prices, with a daily turnover of as much as 6,000 yuan. The Guang'anmen Farmer Service Center is home to more than 500 farmers engaged in this kind of business. Many farmers also use retail prices to buy industrial products supplied to the city's residents in bulk and sell them to other places. Due to their blind trafficking, many commodities are circulating in a roundabout way. The Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ding County, Hebei Province, transported 50,000 catties of cattails to Beijing for sale, while the county's supply and marketing cooperative sent people to Beijing to buy cattails.

Market prices have become chaotic. Bran is sold at a unified price of 5.6 cents per catty, but they sell it for 10 cents. The most serious problem is the purchase and sale price of peanuts. The state stipulates that the highest price for dry peanuts is 12 cents per catty, but farmers buy wet peanuts for 14 to 17 cents and sell them for 48 cents per catty after frying, and peanut kernels are as high as 80 cents per catty. Although the relevant commercial departments have banned the free operation of these unified purchase materials, there are still many hawkers selling peanuts on the streets.

Currently, commercial departments have organized work groups to investigate and study these situations and problems, and will formulate management measures in terms of business scope, prices, and market management.

    北京市放宽市场管理后出现新问题
    一些农民专门经商投机贩运
    商业部门组织工作组调查研究解决这个问题
    新华社21日讯　新华社记者卢恭敏报道：北京市放宽市场管理以后，农民们进城出售粉条、白薯、蔬菜、扫帚、柳草编组物、小鸡、水产、鸡蛋等各种土产和副产品的数量和品种，比过去增加很多。每天光小鸡平均就上市六千只，有些农民还流动在街头和小巷出卖，受到城市居民的欢迎。商品质量一般也比较好，天桥菜站的蔬菜上市量比过去增加了两、三倍。
    随着城乡贸易的扩大，也出现一种很值得注意的新问题，这就是进城的农民慢慢变成了商业小贩了。他们在刚进城时，还从农村带来一些小土产，但卖完后就不回去了，到处摆摊和推小车做生意赚钱。甚至有相当多的农民是空手而来，住在城里就地购销，从中营利。这些农民在农民服务所一住就是十几天或一、两个月，城厢的四个农民服务所经常住满着五、六千个农民和小贩。还有一些没有住处的农民，在白天推着小车，挑着担子沿街叫卖，夜晚便露宿街头、到处为家。
    这些进城的农民由于无人管理，特别是缺乏有领导的交易场所，贩运带有很大的投机性。他们在广安门外曾设置了几十口大锅，把每天从市郊收购的湿花生炒熟，然后分由数百个农民入城设摊高价出售。农民进城经营商业有些是农业生产合作社集体组织的。河北省安新县大五乡旭升农业生产合作社副主任率领一百五十个社员，长期住在北京贩卖杂铜，他们每天到郊区用高于国家收价一倍左右的价格收购杂铜，再以更高的价格卖给本市的公私合营小铁工厂和手工业生产合作社，每天经营额多达六千元。广安门农民服务所就住着五百多个经营这种生意的农民。不少农民还用零售价格成批购买供应本市居民用的工业品，到外地出卖。由于他们的盲目贩运，也造成许多商品迂回流转现象。河北省定县黎明农业生产合作社运来五万斤蒲草在北京推销，而这个县的供销合作社却又派人来北京购买蒲草。
    市场价格已出现混乱现象。麸皮统销价每斤才五分六厘，他们以一角出售。最严重的是花生的购销价格，国家规定干花生价格最高是一角二分，而农民以一角四分到一角七分的价格买湿花生，炒熟后每斤以四角八分销售，花生米每斤高达八角。虽然有关商业部门已经取缔这种统购物资的自由经营，但街头上叫卖花生的小贩依然很多。
    目前，商业部门已经组织工作组，正在对这些情况和问题进行调查研究，将从经营范围、价格、市场管理等方面制定出管理办法。
