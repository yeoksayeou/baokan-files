Xinhua News Agency, November 20th – The oil supply shortage in Western European countries, caused by the situation in the Middle East, is worsening daily and is having serious consequences. According to a United Press report, since most Western European countries have only enough oil to last about three months, the governments of many countries are planning to implement oil rationing after Christmas.

    The French government has decided that, starting from November 24th, gasoline stations will stop supplying fuel for forty-eight hours every weekend (from Saturday noon to Monday noon). Due to insufficient fuel oil supplies, many factories using oil as a power source have switched to coal, resulting in a shortage of coal for household use. The lack of fuel oil has severely impacted the French automobile industry, and some automobile factories have already begun to shorten their working days. Parisian newspapers point out that many businesses may be forced to shut down or reduce production due to the threat of insufficient oil.

    In Britain, bus services have been reduced. National newspapers are promoting the need to conserve oil and are asking people with cars not to use them. As a result, the number of people taking car trips to the suburbs on Sundays has greatly decreased. On November 18th (Sunday), the number of vehicles on the roads leading from London to the suburbs was reduced by half.

    On the 16th, the Norwegian government announced a 10% reduction in oil supplies to vehicle and heating companies.

    On the 16th, the Italian government also requested Italian companies supplying fuel oil to reduce sales by 5%.

    Denmark currently has enough fuel oil in storage for only eight weeks.

    In West Germany, gasoline prices have already begun to rise.

    西欧各国石油荒日益严重
    大多数国家存油只够用三个月
    新华社20日讯　由于中东局势而引起的西欧各国石油供应不足的情况日益恶化，并且正在产生严重的后果。据合众社消息说，由于西欧大多数国家的石油供应大约都只能维持三个月左右，许多国家的政府已经计划要在圣诞节以后实行油料配给制度。
    法国政府已经决定，从11月24日起，实行汽油站每周末（从星期六中午到星期一中午）停止供应四十八小时的制度。由于燃料用油供应不足，许多使用油料作动力的工厂已经改为燃煤，结果引起了家庭用煤的短缺。燃料用油的缺乏使法国汽车工业受到很大打击，一些汽车工厂已经开始缩短工作日。巴黎报纸指出，许多企业都可能因为石油不足的威胁而被迫停工或是缩减生产。
    在英国，公共汽车的班次已经减少。全国的报纸都在宣传必须节约石油，并且要求有汽车的人不要使用自己的汽车。因此，星期天坐汽车出去郊游的人大大减少了。11月18日（星期天），在从伦敦通往郊外的大路上，车辆减少了一半。
    挪威政府16日已经宣布把供给车辆和暖气公司用的石油削减10％。
    意大利政府16日也要求意大利供应燃料用油的企业把销售量削减5％。
    丹麦目前储存的燃料用油只够用八个星期。
    在西德，汽油的价格已经开始上涨。
