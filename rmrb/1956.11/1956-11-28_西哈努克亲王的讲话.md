Prince Sihanouk's Speech

Mr. Prime Minister, our dearest Chinese friends, ladies and gentlemen:

As the King's representative, it is a privilege and an honor for me to express, on behalf of our government and the entire nation, to our dearest guest, Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, our gratitude for the speech he just delivered. At the same time, I would also like to thank Prime Minister Zhou for his thoughtfulness in arranging this reception for the honor of the Cambodian government on the eve of his departure.

We hope that during your short stay in our country, as you visit the main economic, industrial, and cultural centers of our Cambodia, and come into contact with our leaders, some young people, and the people, Prime Minister Zhou will be able to use your customary wisdom to discover the love, faith, and gratitude of the Cambodian people for you and for the great country you represent.

I am certain that no foreign guest has ever received such a widespread and enthusiastic welcome and aroused such an exciting response in Cambodia as you have. Mr. Prime Minister, Phnom Penh, Kampong Cham Province, and Siem Reap Province have unreservedly dedicated their hearts to you.

If our welcome is fortunate enough to please you, please do not think that it comes from a desire to please or has some speculative nature. We have always been accustomed to treating our guests according to their value, not according to their power or our interests. We value moral and spiritual values ​​most highly, and we do not understand flattering political tactics.

Our overly honest insistence has sometimes miscalculated us. Our diplomacy, based solely on loyalty and adhering to the principles of logic and truth, has been, or will (and I fear it will) be misunderstood by some major powers or criticized by some public opinion circles. But it is impossible to change the personality of a nation that has been forged over many centuries.

Mr. Prime Minister, as you know, we build our foreign policy on a neutral path. These neutral lines have also been misunderstood abroad, that is to say, apart from a few wise people including your Prime Minister, some say we are too selfish, some say we are playing tricks, and have received alms from both sides. These people completely misunderstand us.

We want neutrality because we have experienced and therefore know the damage that a small country can suffer, whether it is willing or unwilling to participate in disputes between major power groups. We want neutrality because we refuse to allow certain people to interfere in our affairs under some pretext and drag us out of the political path that our national interests should follow. We want neutrality because we know that we can only contribute a ridiculously small amount of strength to a certain group, but it may bring disaster to our sovereignty, peace, and national unity.

However, our neutrality is not selfish. We absolutely do not want to retreat into an ivory tower. We firmly participate in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, so that when possible, we can use our influence to enable other countries, for fear of the disasters brought by war, to rebuild their friendship on the basis of mutual respect for independence and mutual benefit. We believe that the Panchashila should be earnestly implemented under any circumstances. We believe that large and small countries are morally equal. We believe in all promises, and we are prepared to defend peace in the world. This principle is not too far from what Your Excellency said in our parliament. After having the honor of participating in the United Nations, participating in the United Nations Charter, which advocates that all countries practice tolerance and live in harmony with each other as good neighbors, Cambodia has the obligation to resolve international disputes by peaceful means and to avoid violent violations of foreign sovereignty and independence.

We are very grateful for foreign aid, if it is only to send aid to our poor people to build their country and develop their economic independence. This is extremely obvious, just like the assistance China has given us.

I dare say that in the parliament and in the cabinet meetings, we have determined that we would rather not have any aid that comes with even the slightest bit of selling our independence and freedom. This is our very simple but also very firm position. All of this can be judged from our words and deeds when we fought for independence. When foreign countries invaded our territory, at the Geneva and Bandung conferences, in the countries I visited, and in events such as Egypt and Hungary, we unflinchingly followed these principles: defending peace, realizing peaceful coexistence through action, and mutual respect for national sovereignty, Non-interference in internal affairs—these are the driving forces behind our actions.

I would also like to say that we are not selfish, nor will we be ungrateful. The word ungratefulness is the greatest sin for us Buddhists.

There are many people, many countries, who prefer flattering and servile attitudes to honesty, but the Cambodian people's simplicity, honesty, self-esteem, and love of freedom will not flatter or act. However, when they offer you friendship, just as they have just offered it to you, Prime Minister Zhou, you Prime Minister Zhou can believe that he will not ask you to take it back.

Mr. Prime Minister, I dare to say this to you in order to let you know that our national character is like this, and this kind of national friendship from conscience will not deceive people. Our people admire your extraordinary talent that has made your country great and prosperous. We firmly obey and implement Panchashila in order to rebuild the bridge of friendship between our two nations. Our people faithfully participate in these principles initiated by the great country represented by Your Excellency. They believe that China's friendship does not hinder their free development, does not buy their independence and their sovereignty, or their political ideals and their democratic path.

Mr. Prime Minister, from your sincere attitude and your smile, from the understanding you have shown for our wishes, our people can obtain the guarantee that in the future there will be no misunderstandings between our two nations, that we can hold hands and respect each other's sovereignty and cooperate for prosperity and peace.

In the name of the entire Cambodian people, in the name of the King and Queen whom I represent tonight, and in my own name, I express my deepest gratitude for your visit. China's friendship to us is more precious than anything and any language.

Your visit is the most glorious page written in our history, and our compatriots, both young and old, will preserve an unforgettable memory.

All our warm blessings will follow you, Prime Minister, we bless your "Journey for Friendship" and your own great success.

We ask you to convey to Chairman Mao Zedong and the people of the whole country our warm blessings for their happiness and prosperity.

I ask you to drink a toast to Chairman Mao Zedong and Prime Minister Zhou Enlai.

### 西哈努克亲王的讲话

1956-11-28
第4版()
专栏：

    西哈努克亲王的讲话总理先生，我们最亲爱的中国朋友，诸位先生：
    作为国王的代表，对我是一种特权和荣誉能够在今晚向我们最亲爱的贵宾，周恩来总理先生，来表示我们的政府和全国人民对他刚才所发表的讲话的感谢，同时我也要感谢总理先生的细心，在离开这儿的前一天，为了柬埔寨政府的荣誉而安排了这个招待会。
    我们希望在您逗留在我们的国土上的短短的几天里，在您参观了我们柬埔寨的主要的经济、工业、和文化生活的中心点，并且接触了我们的负责人、一些青年和人民以后，总理先生能够用您的惯有的机智，来发现柬埔寨全国人民对您和对您所代表的伟大的国家的敬爱、信仰和感戴的心情。
    我敢肯定的就是，从来没有一个外来的宾客，能够同您一样在柬埔寨得到这样普遍的、热烈的欢迎和激起这么兴奋的反应。总理先生，金边市、磅湛省、暹粒省，没有迟疑地把他们的心奉献给您。
    如果我们的欢迎能够荣幸地得到您的欢心的话，请您不要以为这是出自讨好的心理，或是有某种投机的性质。我们向来惯于按照我们的客人的价值来招待他，而不是按照他的威权或者我们的利益来招待他的。我们以道义的、精神的价值为最高，我们并不懂得用讨好的政治手腕。
    我们过于诚实的坚持曾经使我们失算。我们的外交仅凭忠信，依从逻辑和真理为原则，曾经，或者还要（这是我恐怕会有的）遭到某一些强国的误解，或者某一些舆论界的批评。但是人们是不可能改变一个历很多世纪所铸成的民族的个性的。
    总理先生，就如您所知道的那样，我们把我们的外交政策建筑在中立的路线上。这些中立路线也是在国外被人家误会了，就是说，除开了包括了您总理先生在内的几位明智的人士而外，有的说我们太自私了，有的说在玩把戏，已经得到了两方面的施舍。这些人是完全不了解我们的。
    我们要中立，是因为我们经历了、因而知道了一个小国不论它愿意或者不愿意参加大国集团的争端，所可能遭到的损害。我们要中立，因为我们不肯让某些人以某种借口来干预我们的事情，来把我们拖出我们的国家利益所应当遵循的政治路线。我们要中立，是因为我们知道我们只可能贡献给某一个集团极可笑的力量，然而却可能对我们的主权、安静和民族团结带来灾害。
    但是，我们的中立并不是自私的。我们绝对不想退隐到象牙塔里去。我们坚决地参加了和平共处的五项原则，以便在可能的时候，以我们的影响来使得其他的国家，为了害怕战争所带来的灾害，能够在互相尊重独立和互利的基础上，来重建他们的友情。我们相信潘查希拉无论在什么情形下都是要切切实实地实施的，我们相信大小国家在道义上是平等的，我们相信一切的诺言，我们准备着为世界保卫和平。这个原则离阁下在我们议会上所说的是不会太远的。在有幸参加了联合国组织，参加了这个主张各国力行容恕、彼此以善邻之道和睦相处的联合国宪章以后，柬埔寨就有义务以和平的手段来解决国际的争端，来避免以暴力侵犯外国的主权和独立。
    外来的援助，如果仅仅是送来援助我们的穷苦的人民来建设他们的国家，来发展他们的经济独立的话，我们是非常感激的。这是极其明显的，就好像中国给予我们的援助一样。
    我敢说，在议会和在内阁会议上，我们已经确定，任何附带什么一点点出卖我们的独立和自由的援助，我们宁可不要。这是我们很简单的然而也是很坚定的立场。所有这一切，人们都可以从我们在争取独立的时候的言行中判明。当外国侵略我们的国土的时候，在日内瓦和在万隆会议上，在我所访问的国家里和在例如埃及和匈牙利的事件中，我们是绝对不退缩地遵行着这些原则：保卫和平，以行动来实现和平共处，互相尊重国家主权，互不干涉内政，这些都是我们的行动的原动力。
    我还要说，我们并不自私，我们也不会忘恩负义。忘恩这个字，对我们信奉佛教的人民来说，是一种最大的罪恶。
    有很多人，有很多的国家，对讨好奉承和奴颜婢膝的态度，比对诚实更喜欢，但是柬埔寨人民的单纯、诚实、自尊和爱好自由的个性是不会阿谀献媚地做作的。但是，要是他们把友情献给您的时候，就像他刚才献给您总理先生的时候，您总理先生就可以相信他是不会再向您要回来的。
    总理先生，我敢这样向您说，就是为了要您知道我们的民族气节是这样的，这种来自良知的民族友谊是不会骗人的。我们的人民敬爱您的使您的国家达到伟大和繁荣的超人才干。我们坚决地服从和实现潘查希拉是为了来重建我们两个民族间的友谊的桥梁。我们的人民很忠实地参加了以阁下为代表的大国所发起的这些原则。他们相信中国的友谊并不阻碍他们自由的发展，并不收买他们的独立和他们的主权，或者他们的政治理想和他们的民主路线。
    总理先生，我们的人民，从您的诚恳的态度和您的笑容中，从您对我们的愿望所表现的理解中，可以得到将来我们两个民族间可以没有什么误会而手牵手地互相尊重主权和为繁荣和和平而合作的保证。
    以全柬埔寨人民的名义，以我今晚所代表的国王和王后的名义，以我自己的名义，我向您这次光临访问致深深的感谢。中国对我们的友谊是比无论什么东西和语言都更加宝贵的。
    您这次的访问，是写在我们的史册上最辉煌的一页，我们的同胞，无论青年和老年，都将保存永不消逝的纪念。
    我们一切的热烈的祝福，将跟着您，总理先生，我们祝福您的“为了友谊的旅行”和您自己的伟大成功。
    我们要求您向毛泽东主席和全国人民转达我们对他们的幸福和繁荣的热烈祝福。
    我请诸位为毛泽东主席、周恩来总理干杯。
