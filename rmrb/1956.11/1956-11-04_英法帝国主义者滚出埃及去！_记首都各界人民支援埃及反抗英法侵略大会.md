English and French Imperialists Get Out of Egypt!
    ——A Record of the People of the Capital Supporting the Egyptian People's Resistance Against Anglo-French Aggression
  　By Our Reporter
      Over 400,000 enraged people of Beijing gathered in front of Tiananmen Square yesterday. Over 400,000 hands were raised high, shouting in unison, "English and French Imperialists get out of Egypt!"
    Over 400,000 enraged people came to Tiananmen Square. An endless sea of people, thousands of red flags, and tens of thousands of triangular colored flags covered with slogans, flames seemed to spew out the Chinese people's anger towards imperialism.
    What is the situation of the war in Egypt? What is the fate of our brothers on the banks of the Nile? People held newspapers in their hands, reading them excitedly. Those without newspapers gathered in circles to listen to others read. After reading, seeing that there was still time before the meeting started, they sat together to discuss their feelings.
    Groups of students from the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics surrounded their professors. One professor was talking about the story of the Anglo-French Allied Forces and the Eight-Power Allied Forces occupying Beijing, and about his personal participation in the "December 9th" anti-imperialist struggle. Another professor, who had participated in the Chinese People's Liberation War, was talking about the story of the Chinese people using inferior weapons to resist counter-revolutionary armed forces. Their stories educated the young students to cherish the tradition of the Chinese youth's anti-imperialist struggle, and to understand the difficult road of revolutionary struggle; they also aroused the young students' respect for the struggling Egyptian people even more.
    To the east of the reviewing stand were the workers of the Beijing No. 1 Construction Company. Their work is very busy. In the past few years, they have built so many buildings in Beijing. The bombs thrown by the Anglo-French bandits on the peaceful constructions in Cairo were like bombs exploding in their hearts. How much labor was destroyed in the explosions. They found a map, looked at it carefully, and marked the places where the bombs were dropped with red ink. The signs on the coats of Hua Zukun and Xie Dequan, workers of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, were particularly eye-catching. They and more than a hundred partners were sent to Fengtai to study pipe pile foundation work. These days, after work, everyone rushed to read the newspaper or listened to the radio. Late at night, people were still talking about the situation in Egypt. Chinese workers cannot stand idly by and watch imperialism run rampant. We must show the Anglo-French imperialists what we're made of!
    The workers of the Changxindian Railway Factory, who had a glorious history in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, also came to Tiananmen today. Model worker Ti Baotian and lathe workers Han Jingzhong, Gao Fengyun, and Li Qin unanimously expressed their willingness to sacrifice everything to support the Egyptian people. They said: "If imperialists bully our Egyptian worker brothers, it's just like we ourselves are being bullied. We must work hard to increase production to support them."
    Farmers from the suburbs also rushed here today. They had just harvested the crops from the fields, and the fruits of a year's labor were about to be happily distributed. "Imperialists are going to destroy our peaceful life again!" This sentence ignited their hearts like fire. Braving the cold wind, they rushed to the city early in the morning. Zhang Xiuwen, the 19-year-old deputy director of the May 1st Agricultural Production Cooperative, said well: "Our cooperative has increased its income again this year, and life is getting better year by year. We can't just watch our Egyptian farmer brothers suffer."
    Under the banner of Peking University, there was a team of more than seven thousand people. The students of Peking University sent a telegram to their Egyptian classmates at Cairo University last night to pay their respects. International students studying at Peking University from North Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Mongolia, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic also came to Tiananmen today with their Chinese classmates to participate in the rally. Indonesian student Sumarsuno said: "It is an act of aggression for the British and French to fight in Egyptian territory. I fully support our cabinet's decision to invite the Prime Ministers of the Colombo countries to meet and discuss the issue of stopping the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt."
    Among the many young people, these hundreds of elderly men and women stood together, looking so energetic. This is the residents' team from Taotiao Hutong, Dongsi. Aunt Hui Zixi's pair of thin, small feet looked worrying. She hadn't walked so many miles at once in recent years! Strangely, she wasn't tired at all today! It was a mother's heart that was supporting her! Another young mother, Xie Cheng, is only in her twenties this year, and she has a little daughter who is just over two years old. She has been anxiously watching the news about Egypt these days. She said: "It's really like growing up in a garden when children are born in our country. Our happy life is brought about by peace. Thinking of the Egyptian mothers and children bleeding and dying under the whistling of bombs these days, I really can't bear it anymore." She said: "We must rescue Egypt, rescue the Egyptian mothers and children!"
    In Tiananmen Square, there was also a group of marching people wearing red scarves. They were students from the No. 2 Experimental Primary School, the No. 2 Central Primary School, the Dongmaweimao Hutong Primary School, and the Bingjiaochang Primary School. Their teachers had all come to the rally. They had no classes this afternoon. On the way home from school, they sneaked over here to attend the meeting. Their parents didn't know yet. Would they blame them? Would they say they were naughty? However, they said aggrievedly: "We already understand things! Egyptian children can't go to school, of course we have to oppose the bad Anglo-French people."
    A team of athletes wearing bright red jerseys also appeared in Tiananmen Square. Some of them came from the distant south, Guangdong Province, and some came from the northernmost Heilongjiang. They came to Beijing to participate in the 1956 Eight County Football Championship. They had just finished the competition in the morning, and when they heard the news of the mass rally, they didn't even have time to change their clothes and came to participate in the rally.
    Standing in Tiananmen Square today were the leaders of China's democratic parties, leaders of the workers' movement, women's movement, and youth movement, leaders of Islamic and other religious organizations, representatives of the industrial and commercial circles, famous professors, scientists, writers... Whether it was an old man with a long beard or a young person just starting their life, everyone's face revealed an unsuppressed anger.
    At 2:20 p.m., the rally began.
    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, led and presided over the mass rally. This famous peace fighter stood on the Tiananmen Gate Tower and declared to the world: The Chinese people stand on the side of Egypt! The Chinese people resolutely and forever support the Egyptian people's sacred war of resistance to safeguard national sovereignty and national independence! Guo Moruo condemned Britain and France as "shameful aggressors" and "the chief culprits in destroying peace."
    His impassioned speech expressed the will of the people throughout the venue, and was interrupted countless times by applause and cheers.
    The leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, various democratic parties, and people's organizations spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that the heroic Egyptian people are fighting to defend world peace and uphold justice. The Egyptian people's struggle is not isolated. 600 million Chinese people fully support the heroic struggle of their Egyptian brothers and sisters! The righteous people of the whole world are their reserves.
    Mr. Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, had not recovered from a long illness, and he had not participated in social activities for a long time. He came to the mass rally to speak today despite his illness. Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, was so excited that she could hardly finish her speech. She and the wife of the Egyptian ambassador embraced each other warmly and for a long time on Tiananmen Square.
    When Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, asked: "Dear young comrades, do you have the confidence to smash the aggression of British and French imperialism?"
    More than 400,000 people answered him in unison: "Yes!"
    Slogan-like waves swept through the venue. Hundreds of thousands of small flags waved together. The mass rally warmly welcomed the speech of the representative of heroic Egypt.
    Egyptian Ambassador Hassan Ragab walked to the microphone. His voice was heavy, but full of strength. He said: While we are meeting, imperialism is destroying our cities and villages, setting fire to the crops in the fields, and massacring tens of thousands of women and children. However, they cannot extinguish the spirit of the Egyptian people's struggle.
    After passing the two telegrams "On Supporting the Egyptian People's Resistance Against Anglo-French Aggression" and "On Protesting the Anglo-French Armed Aggression Against Egypt," the parade began.
    People first came to the front of the British Chargé d'Affaires Office on Zhengyi Road. The parade was led by the presidium of the conference, including Chen Shutong, Lai Ruoyu, Liu Ningyi, and Hu Yaobang.
    The masses were very excited. They walked to the front of the British representative office and shouted slogans: "No burning! No aggression!" "Oppose aggression, defend peace!" "Down with imperialism!" "Long live Egypt!" Many people raised slogan signs and cartoon signs in front of the British, showing them.
    Another parade demonstration team went straight to the Egyptian Embassy via Yuhe Bridge and Dongjiaominxiang. Walking at the front of the team were Guo Moruo, Zhang Bojun, Bao Erhan, Liao Chengzhi, Zhu Xuefan, Shao Lizi, Huang Shaohong, Cao Mengjun and others. They and the marching crowd shouted slogans such as "Anglo-French aggressive troops immediately withdraw from Egypt!" and "Defend world peace!".
    Egyptian Ambassador to China, Ragab, received Guo Moruo and others in the embassy's living room.
    At this time, the marching crowd outside the embassy, ​​together with Egyptian professor Ali Anulfiqi from the Islamic Scriptures Academy, were shouting "Long live China and Egypt!" in Chinese. When Egyptian Ambassador to China Ragab and Bao Erhan and others appeared on the balcony, the slogans and cheers became even louder. Badras, the cultural attache of the Egyptian Embassy in China, addressed the crowd. He said: "I just came from Egypt today. I bring greetings from the Egyptian people to the Chinese people. I left my family and friends in Egypt, but I am very happy that I have found relatives and friends in China. Let me extend my greetings to the Chinese government and people, you are our best friends."
    At this time, representatives from various units and groups recommended from the parade team had lined up from the balcony to the stairs. Snowflakes of support letters and condolence letters were handed to Ambassador Ragab from their hands. A letter from all the teachers, students and staff of the Beijing Institute of Physical Education was delivered by one hundred students, relaying from the school to the embassy.
    Tens of thousands of marching people, like a surging tide, flowed into the courtyard of the embassy, ​​and the passionate songs of support and slogans continued into the night. (Attached photo)

    英法帝国主义者滚出埃及去！
    ——记首都各界人民支援埃及反抗英法侵略大会
  　本报记者
      四十多万被激怒了的北京人民昨天在天安门前集会。四十多万双手高高举起，齐声高呼“英法帝国主义滚出埃及去！”
    四十多万被激怒的群众来到天安门广场上。一眼望不尽的密密的人群，成千面红旗和几万面三角的写满标语的彩旗，火焰似地喷吐出中国人民对于帝国主义的愤怒。
    埃及的战况怎样了？尼罗河畔的兄弟们的命运怎么样了？人们手里拿着报纸在激动地读着。没有报纸的就围成个圈听人念。念完以后看看离开会的时间还早，就坐在一起谈感想。
    北京航空学院的一群群学生围在他们的教授身边。这一位教授在谈英法联军和八国联军占领北京的故事，在谈他亲身参加“一二九”反帝斗争的故事。那里一位参加过中国人民解放战争的教授在谈中国人民以劣势的武装抗击反革命武装的故事。他们的故事教育着青年学生珍视中国青年反帝斗争的传统，了解革命斗争的艰难道路；也更加激起了青年学生对于斗争中的埃及人民的敬意。
    在观礼台东边的是北京市第一建筑公司的工人。他们的工作很忙。几年来他们在北京盖起了多少座楼房啊。英法强盗扔在开罗的和平建筑上的炸弹就像炸在他们心上。多少劳动在爆炸声中毁灭了。他们把地图找来，仔细的看，用红笔标出扔炸弹的地方。武汉长江大桥工程局工人华祖焜和谢德全外衣上的标志特别引人注意。他们和一百多伙伴派到丰台研究管柱基础工作。这几天大伙一下班，不是抢着看报，就是围着听广播。晚上夜深了，人们还在谈论埃及的局势。中国工人不能眼睁睁看着帝国主义逞凶。一定要给英法帝国主义者一点颜色看！
    在反帝反封建斗争中有过光辉历史的长辛店铁路工厂的职工们今天也来到天安门。这个工厂的劳动模范遆宝田和车工韩景仲、高凤云、李勤等一致表示不惜牺牲一切来支援埃及人民。他们说：“帝国主义欺负埃及工人弟兄，也就好比我们自己被欺负一样。我们要努力增产支援他们。”
    郊区的农民今天也赶来了。他们刚把地里的庄稼收起，一年的劳动果实正待喜滋滋地来分配。“帝国主义又要来破坏咱们的和平生活啦”这一句话像火一样地点燃了他们的心胸。他们冒着寒风，一清早就赶到城里来了。五一农业生产合作社的十九岁的副社长张秀文说得好：“我们今年社里又增加了收入，光景一年比一年过得好。可不能眼看着咱们的埃及农民弟兄遭灾难。”
    在北京大学的旗帜下面，是七千多人的队伍。北大的学生在昨天晚间打电报向开罗大学的埃及同学们致敬。在北京大学读书的朝鲜、越南、印度尼西亚、印度、蒙古、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、南斯拉夫、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国的留学生，今天也同中国同学一同来天安门参加大会。印度尼西亚学生苏玛苏诺说：“英法到埃及领土内作战是一种侵略行为，我完全拥护我们内阁关于邀请科伦坡国家总理开会，商讨制止英法侵略埃及问题的决定。”
    在许许多多年轻人中间，这几百位上了年纪的老大爷、老大娘站在一起精神显得多么好呀。这是东四桃条胡同的居民队伍。惠子熙大娘的一双瘦小的脚看来令人担心，她几年来还没有像今天一下子走这么几里路哩！奇怪今天怎么一点也不累呀！这是一颗母亲的心在支持着她！另一个年轻的母亲谢诚今年才二十多岁，她有一个刚满二岁的小女儿。她最近这些日子总是非常焦急地看着报道埃及的消息。她说：“孩子生在我们祖国真像长在花园里一样，我们的幸福生活是和平带来的。想到这几天埃及的母亲和孩子正在炸弹的呼啸下流血和死亡，真是再也忍受不住。”她说：“要抢救埃及，抢救埃及的母亲和孩子！”
    在天安门广场上，还有一群带着红领巾的游行群众。他们是第二实验小学、第二中心小学、东马尾帽胡同小学、冰窖场小学的学生。他们的老师都来参加大会了，他们今天下午没有课，放学回家的路上，他们溜到这里来开会了。他们的爸爸妈妈还不知道哩。会责怪他们吗？会说他们调皮吗？可是，他们委屈地说：“我们已经懂事了呀！埃及的小朋友不能上学，我们当然要反对英法坏人”。
    在天安门广场上还出现了一支穿着鲜红的球衣的运动员队伍。他们有的来自遥远的南方广东省，有的来自最北的黑龙江，这次来北京参加1956年八县足球锦标赛。上午刚比赛完毕，他们听到召开群众大会的消息，连衣服也来不及换便来参加大会了。
    今天在天安门上站着的，有中国各民主党派的负责人、工人运动、妇女运动和青年运动的领袖、伊斯兰教和其他宗教团体的负责人、工商界的代表、著名的教授、科学家、作家……。无论是长髯垂胸的老人，还是刚刚走向生活的青年，每个人的脸上都流露着难以抑止的愤怒。
    下午二时二十分，大会开始。
    中国保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若领导和主持了这次群众大会。这位著名的和平战士站在天安门城楼上，向全世界宣告说：中国人民站在埃及这一边！中国人民坚决地、永远地支持埃及人民为维护国家主权和民族独立而进行的神圣抗战！郭沫若谴责英国和法国是“可耻的侵略者”，是“破坏和平的罪魁”。
    他的慷慨激昂的讲话，表达了全场群众的意志，无数次地被鼓掌和欢呼所打断。
    中国共产党、各民主党派和人民团体的负责人在会上讲了话，他们指出，英雄的埃及人民是为保卫世界和平和伸张正义而战。埃及人民的斗争不是孤立的，六亿中国人民全力支持埃及兄弟姊妹们的英勇的斗争！全世界正义的人民都是他们的后备军。
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦老先生久病未愈，他已经好久没有参加社会活动。他今天是抱病到群众大会来讲话的。全国妇联副主席李德全激动得几乎不能讲完她的话。她和埃及大使夫人在天安门上长久地、热烈地拥抱在一起。
    当青年团中央书记处书记胡耀邦问：“亲爱的青年同志们，粉碎英、法帝国主义的侵略，你们说有没有把握？”
    四十多万群众同声一致的回答他说：“有！”
    海啸一样的口号扫过会场。几十万面小旗一齐挥动。群众大会热烈地欢迎英雄埃及的代表讲话。
    埃及大使哈桑·拉加布走到扩音器前面。他的声音是沉重的，但是充满力量。他说：当我们正在开会的时候，帝国主义正在炸毁我们的城市和乡村，放火焚烧田野里的庄稼、屠杀成千成万的妇女儿童。但是，他们扑灭不了埃及人民斗争的精神。
    在通过了“关于支援埃及人民反抗英法侵略”和“关于抗议英法武装侵略埃及”两个电文以后，游行开始。
    人们首先来到正义路英国代办处的门前。游行队伍由大会主席团陈叔通、赖若愚、刘宁一、胡耀邦等带队。
    群众十分激动。他们走到英代办处门前高呼：“不许放火！不许侵略！”“反对侵略，保卫和平！”“打倒帝国主义！”“埃及万岁！”等口号。许多人把标语牌和漫画牌抬到英国人面前，给他们看。
    另一路游行示威的队伍经过御河桥、东交民巷直奔埃及大使馆。走在队伍最前面的有郭沫若、章伯钧、包尔汉、廖承志、朱学范、邵力子、黄绍竑、曹孟君等人。他们和游行队伍一同高呼“英法侵略军队立刻从埃及撤退！”“保卫世界和平！”等口号。
    埃及驻我国大使拉加布在使馆的客厅内接见了郭沫若等人。
    这时大使馆外面的游行群众，正和伊斯兰教经学院埃及教授阿里·安尔菲其一起用中文高呼“中国埃及万岁！”当埃及驻我国大使拉加布和包尔汉等出现在阳台上的时候，口号声和欢呼声更加响亮了。埃及驻我国大使馆文化专员巴德拉斯向群众讲了话，他说：“我今天刚从埃及来，我带来了埃及人民给中国人民的问候。我离开了在埃及的家庭和亲友，但是我非常高兴在中国我找到了亲戚和朋友。让我致意中国政府和人民，你们是我们最好的朋友。”
    这时从游行队伍中各单位、团体推举出来的代表们，已经从阳台上一直排列到楼梯上，雪片般的声援书、慰问信纷纷从他们手中交给拉加布大使。北京体育学院全体师生员工的一封信，是由一百名同学，从学校接力跑到大使馆送来的。
    成千上万的游行队伍，像汹涌澎湃的海潮一般流进大使馆的院落，激昂的支援歌声和口号声一直持续到黑夜。（附图片）
