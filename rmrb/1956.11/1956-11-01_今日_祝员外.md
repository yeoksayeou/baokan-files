    Today's "Landlord Zhu"
    Yi Qin
    I remember when watching the Yue opera "The Butterfly Lovers," people's emotions were stirred for a long time. Many people deeply sympathized with Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai and angrily cursed "Landlord Zhu" as "old feudal" and "old stubborn." Now, it is no longer the era in which Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai lived, but in real life, people with stubborn feudal ideas like "Landlord Zhu" have not disappeared. Moreover, some revolutionary cadres and Communist Party members are even playing the role of "Landlord Zhu."
    This is not an exaggeration. Please look at a fact revealed by the Hubei Daily some time ago: Xiong Jinzhi, a women's cadre and Communist Party member in Tuqiao District, Huangmei County, Hubei Province, and Zhang Yiqing, a township cadre and Communist Party member in Outang Township of the same district, developed love in their work. On January 8, 1956, they happily went to the Tuqiao District Office to register their marriage. Who knew that after the District Committee learned about this, it convened a meeting of the District Committee members. At the meeting, from the District Committee Secretary to several District Committee members, all disagreed with their marriage because: first, Xiong Jinzhi was a district cadre and Zhang Yiqing was a township cadre, and marriage would be "detrimental to Xiong's future"; second, it was unreasonable for Xiong Jinzhi to fall in love soon after her divorce; third, some people suspected that Xiong and Zhang had worked together in the past and might have "improper relations between men and women." If their marriage was approved, it would have "a bad political impact." Subsequently, District Committee Secretary Zhou Shuxun, Deputy District Committee Secretary Zhang Zurong, and other District Committee members, respectively, approached Xiong Jinzhi to "enlighten her ideologically"; however, Xiong Jinzhi firmly said: "We will be together until the end of time." Seeing that persuasion was ineffective, the District Committee sent Organization Committee member Huang Shifang to investigate whether Xiong and Zhang had "improper relations between men and women." Because Huang Shifang could not find any evidence anywhere, he adopted the method of intimidation and deception, forcing Xiong and Zhang to admit that they had "married privately." As a result, at the branch party member meeting, they were not only "struggled against" and "ridiculed," but also considered to have "violated the law," and "it would be impossible for them to get married, even if iron trees bloomed." Xiong and Zhang were subjected to such unreasonable interference and insult, and hanged themselves on March 8.
    Of course, we do not approve of the suicide of Xiong Jinzhi and Zhang Yiqing, but this tragedy should be the responsibility of the Tuqiao District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Zhou Shuxun. Why did they interfere with and obstruct the freedom of marriage of young men and women so much? What dirty things are buried deep in their minds? How different are their thoughts from those of "Landlord Zhu"? In those years, "Landlord Zhu" disliked "the poverty of the Liang family," so he felt that marrying his daughter to Liang Shanbo was "not a good match." Now, they believe that a district cadre marrying a township cadre is "detrimental to the woman's future." In those years, "Landlord Zhu" believed that his daughter's marriage must be arranged by her parents. Now, they believe that the marriage of a Communist Party member should be arranged by their District Committee. The situations are different, and the statements are different, but the essence is the same. Moreover, judging from the consequences, they are indeed worse than "Landlord Zhu." Because Landlord Zhu was only the head of a family, and no matter how strict the family rules were, they could only be used to discipline Zhu Yingtai and arrange Zhu Yingtai's marriage. However, Zhou Shuxun and others are the heads of a district. Therefore, they can not only arrange the marriage of Xiong Jinzhi and Zhang Yiqing, but also arrange the marriage of thousands of Xiong Jinzhi and Zhang Yiqing. Then, the harm and the harm caused by "Landlord Zhu" cannot be compared on the same day. In addition, compared with "Landlord Zhu," they can find more "reasons," such as saying that it is "unreasonable" to fall in love with someone soon after a divorce. Does it mean that a divorced person must wait for some time before falling in love and remarrying to be considered "reasonable"?
    From the above situation, it is not difficult to see that deep in the minds of Zhou Shuxun, the secretary of the Tuqiao District Committee, and others, not only are the feudal ideas of "Landlord Zhu" buried, but also the privileged ideas of the old bureaucrats are contaminated.
    The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China has been promulgated for six years, and such a tragedy has occurred. It cannot but arouse serious attention. According to the materials that have been obtained, similar incidents are not limited to this one. For example, such a thing happened in Funan District, Fushun City. Qu Suyan, a young member of the Communist Youth League in Yingshou Village, fell in love with Yuan Shiying, the former accountant of the village health center. However, Qu's mother disliked Yuan Shiying for being "poor" and firmly opposed it. The village party branch secretary and the village head also persuaded Qu, saying: "With your looks, Xiao Yan, you have to find a cadre above the district committee level. If you are with Yuan Shiying, you won't even be able to drink the northwest wind in the future." Qu and Yuan were desperate and wanted to commit suicide several times. After the Funan District Committee heard the news of their attempted suicide, not only did it not come out to intervene in the matter, but it also changed its original decision to recruit Qu Suyan as a salesperson in the district supply and marketing cooperative. It was not until recently that the matter was investigated and resolved by the Fushun City Women's Federation.
    The problem is very clear: to implement the Marriage Law, we must fight against these modern "Landlord Zhus," liquidate the feudal ideas among these people, and make these people wake up and realize that they only have the responsibility to implement the Marriage Law, and have no right to interfere with and arrange other people's marriages. And such illegal means as intimidation and fraud used by the secretary and members of the Tuqiao District Committee to interfere in the private affairs of a couple (this couple did not harm the interests of any third party, because neither of them had a spouse.), and the case of causing death due to interference with freedom of marriage must be punished by law. Because they have seriously violated the Marriage Law and caused serious consequences. Failure to sanction will not guarantee freedom of marriage, and the people's freedom and rights will be arbitrarily violated.

    今日“祝员外”
    宜勤
    记得在看越剧“梁山伯与祝英台”的时候，人们的情绪久久不能平静，许多人对梁山伯、祝英台深表同情，愤恨地骂“祝员外”是“老封建”、“老顽固”。现在，已经不是梁山伯、祝英台所处的时代，但是，在现实生活里，具有“祝员外”那样顽固的封建思想的人，却没有绝迹。而且有些革命干部、共产党员也居然扮起“祝员外”的角色来。
    这并不是夸张，请看湖北日报前些时候揭发出来的一件事实：湖北省黄梅县土桥区妇女干部、共产党员熊金枝和该区藕塘乡乡干部、共产党员张义清，在一起工作中建立了爱情，1956年1月8日，他俩兴高采烈地到土桥区公所登记结婚。谁知区委会知道这件事后，竟召开了区委委员会议，会上，从区委书记到几个区委委员都不同意他们结婚，原因是：一、熊金枝是区干部，张义清是乡干部，结婚后对熊
  “前途不利”；二、熊金枝离婚不久，就与人谈恋爱，是不合乎情理的；三、有人怀疑熊、张二人过去曾在一起工作，可能有“不正当的男女关系”，如果批准他们结婚，“政治影响不好”。随后，就由区委书记周树勋、区委副书记张祖荣和其他区委委员，分别找熊金枝“打通思想”；但是，熊金枝坚定地说：“我俩海枯石烂也要在一起”。区委会见动员无效，又派了组织委员黄世芳去调查熊、张二人是否有“不正当的男女关系”。黄世芳因为到处找不到证据，就采取了恐吓诈骗的办法，迫使熊、张二人承认曾经“私自结婚”，于是，在支部党员大会上，他们两人不仅受到了“斗争”，受到了“嘲笑”，并且被认为是“犯了法”，“要想结婚，就是铁树开花也不可能”。熊、张二人受到这种无理的干涉和侮辱，便在3月8日悬梁自缢了。
    当然，我们并不赞成熊金枝和张义清这种自杀的行为，但是，这一悲剧应该由以周树勋为首的中共土桥区委员会负责任。为什么他们要对青年男女的婚姻自由如此横加干涉和阻挠呢？他们的思想深处究竟埋藏着什么肮脏的东西呢？他们的思想和“祝员外”的思想又有多大差别呢？当年“祝员外”嫌“梁家贫寒”，因此感到把女儿嫁给梁山伯是“门不当”、“户不对”，如今，他们却认为：区干部嫁给乡干部是对女方“前途不利”；当年，“祝员外”认为女儿的婚姻，必须由父母来包办，如今，他们却认为：一个共产党员的婚姻应该由他们区委会来包办。情况不同，说法不一，实质都是一样。而且，从后果看，他们比起“祝员外”来，确实有过之而无不及。因为祝员外终久只是一家之长，家法再严些，也只能用来管教祝英台，包办祝英台的婚姻而已；而周树勋等人，却是一区之长，因此，他们不仅可以包办熊金枝和张义清的婚姻，还可以包办千万个熊金枝和张义清的婚姻，那么，其危害性和“祝员外”所造成的危害当然不能“同日而语”了。另外，他们比起“祝员外”来，还会找出更多的“理由”，譬如说什么离婚不久，就同人谈恋爱是“不合乎情理”；难道说离过婚的人，一定要等多少时候以后再谈恋爱、再结婚，才算是“合乎情理”吗？
    从以上情况中，不难看出：土桥区委书记周树勋等人的思想深处，不仅埋藏着“祝员外”的封建思想，而且还沾染了旧官僚的特权思想。
    中华人民共和国婚姻法颁布六年了，竟然发生了这种悲剧，实在不能不引起严重的注意。根据现在已经得到的材料，类似这样的事件，并不是仅此一件。譬如抚顺市抚南区就曾发生这样的事，该区英守村青年团员屈素彦爱上了该村卫生所前任会计袁士英。但是屈的母亲嫌袁士英“穷”，坚决反对。村党支部书记、村长也劝屈说：“凭着你小彦姑娘，得找个区委以上的干部，你跟袁士英，将来喝西北风也喝不上”。屈袁二人走投无路，几次想自杀。抚南区区委听到他们企图自杀的消息后，不仅没有出来干预此事，反而因此改变了原来录用屈素彦为区供销社营业员的决定。直到最近，此事才由抚顺市妇联调查解决。
    问题非常明白：要贯彻执行婚姻法，必须对这些今日的“祝员外”进行斗争，在这些人当中清算一下封建思想，必须使这些人清醒过来，使他们认识到他们只有贯彻执行婚姻法的责任，而没有干涉和包办人家婚姻的权利。而像土桥区委书记和委员们这样用恐吓诈骗的违法手段去干预一对恋人的私事（这对恋人并未损害任何第三者的利益，因为双方都无配偶。），因干涉婚姻自由而造成人命案件的事情，更必须实行法律制裁。因为他们严重地违犯了婚姻法，并且造成了严重的后果。不制裁就不能保障婚姻自由，人民的自由权利就会经常受到任意的侵犯。
