Xi'an Trials Freshwater Fish Farming

    The Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Xi'an, near the Chan River, successfully trialed freshwater fish farming for the first time by using water from the Chan River. The more than 600,000 fish fry purchased from Wuhan in June have grown rapidly and have not died. This fish was about the size of a mosquito larva when it was put into the fish pond in June, and now it is seven or eight inches long and weighs more than ten taels.

    西安试养淡水鱼
    西安市郊区滻河附近的红光农业生产合作社，引用滻河水，首次试养淡水鱼成功。该社6月间从武汉购回的六十多万尾鱼苗，成长很快，没有发生死亡。这条鱼6月份放进鱼池的时候，同孑孓差不多大小，现在已有七、八寸长，十多两重了。　新华社记者　姜国宪摄
