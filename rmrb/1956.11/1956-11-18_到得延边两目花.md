Arriving in Yanbian, My Eyes Opened
Kang Tuo

Two

In the poetic land of Yanbian, the rice paddies I have mentioned several times are truly a beautiful poem. When I went to Yanbian in mid-August, the "People's Daily" had just reported on the experience of high rice yields here a month earlier, and specifically published an editorial titled "Can Rice be Grown on a Large Scale in the North?". However, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I, who am no stranger to rice paddies, would never have associated this crop with poetry.

On a morning when the drizzle had just stopped, I went to see the rice paddies of the Cui Zhusong Agricultural Cooperative mentioned in the "People's Daily" report. It was in Changbai Township, Yanji City, in an advanced cooperative of two hundred and fifty households that had been fully collectivized at the township level. Labor model Cui Zhusong had gone to Yanji for a meeting, and several cadres from the cooperative guided us on the tour. What I saw was gold everywhere—a type of rice called Aomori No. 5, a late-maturing, early-harvesting variety. Although it was still early in the harvest season, the newly emerging rice grains were tightly packed in a seemingly endless warehouse, and spread out densely layer upon layer on a green carpet-like ocean. In this North Manchurian basin, where you have to wear a jacket by mid-August, the rice paddies were actually growing more lushly than the rice-producing areas along Dongting Lake that I remembered from many years ago, and all of them were densely planted. However, the cooperative cadres said that this was not yet using the latest dense planting method; this was just ordinary rice land, one crop a year, with an average yield of only eight or nine hundred catties per mu…

The cooperative cadres spoke very plainly, but I couldn't help but feel flustered by this number that even exceeded the general yield of double-cropping rice in the south. So, when I walked into another thirty-five mu of high-yield rice land, I didn't even care about the mud on the narrow field ridges obscured by the rice leaves and just kept drilling forward. This rice was called Yuanzi No. 2, late-harvesting and early-planting, with a yield of one thousand four hundred catties per mu. Squatting by the field, you could see the densely packed rice stalks forming beautiful small triangular patterns—three holes per mound, seven or eight plants per hole, and each mound and each hole forming straight lines regardless of their horizontal or diagonal position, creating gaps that appeared to be non-ventilated but were actually ventilated. Here, the ears of rice had not yet fully emerged, but just as the sun peeked out, the scattered early-growing pearl-like grains, in the sunlight, emitted a rising heat, like already ripe, soft, and non-greasy white rice, truly tempting people to drool.

The cooperative cadres talked to us about this year's harvest. They were full of joy about the recent continuous sunny weather after the long rains—the rice was eagerly waiting for the warm water warmed by the sun to promote the growth of the grains. They also talked about various rice-growing techniques. When they heard that rice was not widely grown in the North China region, and some rice farmers did not even know how to transplant rice seedlings, one person blurted out with a laugh:

"Don't know how to transplant rice seedlings? That's can't be allowed to fall behind!"

This person's appearance and language indicated that he was a Han Chinese. Someone introduced him as saying that his Korean was even better than that of the Korean people. In fact, this one sentence of his was well said—it spoke to the high level of rice-growing technology of the Korean compatriots.

High-level technology brings a happy life. We saw that the guest room in the house of middle peasant Li Zhengkui was simply a bright and spacious hall, with four silk quilts in one glass cabinet and a large stack of printed cotton bedding in another. He is a work-point recorder in a production team, with a family of seven and not many laborers, so he can only be considered a middle-income household in the cooperative; but his income last year, after all expenses, still had a surplus of more than six hundred yuan…

And Cui Zhusong's agricultural cooperative is not particularly special in the Yanbian countryside. We also know Jin Shirong, who is famous throughout the country, whose cooperative has grown from forty-eight households in 1951 to one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven households today—including three hundred and eighty Han Chinese households. They also have an agricultural machinery station serving twelve units in the surrounding area, with a total of fourteen tractors and many other mechanized agricultural tools. There are also fairly new-style cattle sheds and a kindergarten of urban scale. Their land stretches from the plains to the deep mountains, and two thousand eight hundred mu of their special product, yellow tobacco, is growing vigorously, so much so that as a smoker, passing by the place where the women were harvesting tobacco leaves, I truly felt as if I were inhaling intoxicating smoke after a meal. Of course, they mainly produce rice. I asked Jin Shirong about the yield of his rice paddies, and he said:

"The average yield per mu is nine hundred catties. However, there has been too much rain this year…"

He seemed uncertain, but I understood that this was his prudence and modesty. On our way together, groups of Han Chinese children came to him shouting, "Jin Shirong, Jin Shirong," and Korean women even came from afar to shake his hand; old people in white clothes would even perform national etiquette to him, and he always treated them with the same naturalness… All of this is precisely a reflection of his humility and prudence, isn't it? When I visited him, it was a beautiful sunny day; I knew that their rice paddies would also achieve a splendid harvest.

    到得延边两目花

    在延边的诗的土地上，我几次提到过的稻地实在是一首优美的诗。当我八月中旬去往延边的时候，“人民日报”刚刚在一个月以前报道过这里水稻丰产的经验，并且专为这件事发表了题名“北方能大量种水稻吗”的社论。不过，如果不是亲眼看见，我这个对稻田并不太陌生的人，是决不会把这种庄稼同诗联系起来的。
    我在一个细雨刚停的上午，去看“人民日报”报道中提到过的崔竹松农业社的稻地。那是在延吉市的长白乡，在一个全乡化的二百五十户的高级社里。劳动模范崔竹松上延吉开会去了，社里的几个干部指引着我们参观。我看见的是遍地黄金——一种名叫青森五号的晚种早收的稻子。尽管离收割季节还早，那刚刚吐出的稻粒，却已经在一个望不到头的仓库里紧紧挤塞着，又像是在一块海洋般的绿毯上层层密密地摊晒开来。在这个八月中旬就得穿上夹衣的北满盆地，稻田竟会比我印象中多年前的洞庭湖滨产米区长得还要肥硕，并且全部都是密植。然而，社里的干部却说，这还没有采用最新式的密植法；这也只是一般的稻地，一年一季，平均亩产不过八九百斤……
    社干部的话说得十分平易，我却不能不在这个甚至要超过南方双季稻一般产量的数字前面，给弄得手足失措。于是，等到走进另外三十五亩高产稻地，我竟至不顾被稻叶遮没了的狭窄田坎上的泥泞而直往前钻。这种稻名叫元子二号，晚收早种，亩产一千四百斤。蹲在田边，可以看到密聚的稻秆组成了小三角形的美术图案——每堆三穴，每穴七八株，各堆各穴不论横斜都互成直线，而这就貌似不通风却实际有通风的间隙。这里还没怎么吐穗，不过，恰好太阳露脸，那零星的早生的珍珠颗粒，在阳光中冒着腾腾的热气，宛如已经熟透的软而不腻的白米饭，真要引得人口角流涎。
    社里的干部同我们谈起了今年的年景。他们对久雨以后最近开始连续放晴的天气充满喜悦——水稻正迫切等待给太阳晒暖的温水催生谷粒。他们又谈起了种稻的各种技术。当他们听说华北地区种稻不多，有些稻农甚至还不会插秧的时候，有一个人竟冲口而出地笑道：
    “不会插秧？那可是再不能落后啦！”
    这个人的长相和语言，说明了他是一个汉族。有人介绍他说，他的朝鲜话比朝鲜族说的还好。其实，他这一句话就说的不错——说出了朝鲜族同胞种稻技术的高强。
    高强的技术就带来了美满的生活。我们看到中农李正奎家的客室简直是一个敞亮的厅堂，一只玻璃柜内放着四条绸被，另一只内还有一大叠花布被褥。他是一个生产队的记工员，家中七口人，劳力不多，只能算社里的中等户；但他去年的收入却除了一切花销，还有六百多元的剩余……
    而崔竹松他们农业社在延边农村也并不算特别。我们还知道闻名全国的金时龙，他那个合作社已经从1951年的四十八户发展到如今的一千七百七十七户——其中有汉族三百八十户。他们那里还有一个为远近十二个单位服务的农业机器站，站内共有十四台拖拉机和其它许多机械化的农具。那里并有相当新式的牛舍，有城市规模的幼儿园。那里的土地从平原伸展到深山，二千八百亩特产的黄烟正长得肥头大耳，以至于我这个抽烟的人路过妇女们收割烟叶之处，真如饭后吸着了使人迷醉的浓烟。当然那里主要也是出产稻米。我问了问金时龙稻田的产量，他说：
    “平均亩产九百斤。不过，今年雨水太多……”
    他好像不敢肯定，但我却懂得这是他的谨慎和谦虚。在我们同行的路上，汉族儿童一群群拥来对他喊着：“金时龙，金时龙”，朝鲜族妇女也要老远赶来同他握手；白衣的老人更要向他施一施民族礼节，而他也总是同样自然地对待……所有这一切，不都正是他谦虚谨慎的反映么？我访问他的时候，正是大好的晴天；我知道，他们的稻田也同样会获得锦绣似的丰收的。
