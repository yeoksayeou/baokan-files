Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch from Amman: Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi announced in Parliament on the 27th that the Jordanian government has decided to abolish the military alliance with Britain and demanded that all British troops withdraw from Jordanian territory. He also announced that the Jordanian government is considering establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and other countries.

This decision to end the unequal treaty signed between Jordan and Britain in 1948 was met with enthusiastic applause in Parliament.

In his speech, Prime Minister Nabulsi vehemently criticized Britain's aggression against Egypt. He said, "In order to take consistent action with the Arab sister countries that provide us with financial assistance, the government will abolish this treaty, cancel British bases, and arrange for the withdrawal of British troops from this country."

The Prime Minister said that the Jordanian government has agreed in principle to accept aid from Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia to compensate for the "aid" Jordan previously received from Britain under the Anglo-Jordanian treaty. He also announced that the Jordanian government agrees to an economic union between Syria and Jordan.

Nabulsi advocated that the foreign policies of all Arab countries must be consistent, saying that his government will promote good relations with all countries friendly to the Arabs.

The Prime Minister condemned the Baghdad Pact, considering it "dangerous for the Arabs," and said his government would never join it.

Nabulsi announced that strong steps will be taken to strengthen the country's armed forces. "The government will arm our army with effective weapons—especially the air force, and will cooperate with Arab countries in this regard."

Nabulsi said that Jordan has established a "national liberation regime" which will be based on "constitutional democratic principles." He said that the government will soon formulate appropriate laws stipulating the freedom of individuals, political parties, newspapers, and local autonomy."

He said that the government believes that the current electoral law and government administrative institutions need to be reorganized.

The Prime Minister resolutely denied the possibility of concluding a peace treaty with Israel.

Nabulsi paid tribute to "the struggle of the sister country Egypt in the face of British, French, and Israeli aggression, its heroism, and its steadfast spirit." He said that all Jordanians unanimously "extend joyful and admiring congratulations to President Nasser and all Egyptian officers, soldiers, and civilians."
