    China Firmly Stands with Egypt
    Egyptian Ambassador Talks About China's Aid to Egypt
    Egyptian Ambassador Hassan Ragheb said today: "New China is providing timely and generous aid to relieve Egypt's war casualties, which shows that it is writing a new page in humanitarian history."
    The Egyptian ambassador made a statement at a press conference this morning, saying: "I can be sure that in these days of severe trials, China will always stand in the forefront as Egypt's best and most sincere friend.
    "Within twenty-four hours after the Egyptian people issued a call for assistance, China responded very beautifully to this call." He said that the Chinese government opened an account of 20 million Swiss francs in the name of Egypt, allowing it to purchase any materials it needs in its difficulties.
    Ambassador Ragheb continued: "When Premier Zhou Enlai handed me this decision, he told me that he felt very sorry that due to the existing amount of Swiss franc foreign exchange, he could not provide more assistance, and other countries' currencies would be frozen when allocated to Egypt."
    He revealed that thousands of tons of grain and other relief supplies requested by Egypt are on their way to Egypt. He also said: "The Chinese Red Cross has donated 170,000 Swiss francs to the Egyptian Red Crescent Society as a relief fund for the war dead and wounded. A team of nurses and doctors is being prepared for Egypt's emergency needs."
    The Egyptian Ambassador continued, in addition to the material assistance provided by China, the Egyptian Embassy in Beijing receives thousands of letters every day from students, workers, farmers and others. He said that some letters were written by elementary school students under the age of ten.
    Ambassador Ragheb said that China is registering volunteers. But he said that he has not received a response from his government regarding the issue of volunteers going to Egypt. He said: "Egypt still has great trust and confidence in the United Nations Organization to fully implement its resolutions on the withdrawal of all aggressor troops from Egyptian territory."
    However, the ambassador warned: "In the event that the United Nations resolutions cannot be implemented - which we all hope will not happen - the Egyptian government can take any action at will."
    Ambassador Ragheb condemned the Anglo-French aggression, considering it the "most brutal attack", he said: "Imperialism, which is heading towards death, will not leave a clean name in this world.
    "The Anglo-French attack on Egyptian territory and the indiscriminate bombing of cities has written one of the darkest chapters in the history of imperialism, and the whole world will never forget it in future generations."
    Ambassador Ragheb declared: "The heroic struggle of Port Said will forever be recorded in the history of heroic struggle. Imperialism has learned a very severe lesson this time, and it must thoroughly consider this lesson before launching another attack on freedom-loving countries."

    中国坚决站在埃及一边
    埃及大使谈我国援助埃及
    新华社17日讯　埃及大使哈桑·拉加卜今天说：“新中国正在提供及时而慷慨的援助来救济埃及的战争伤亡人员，这表明它正在人道历史上写下崭新的一页。”
    这位埃及大使今天上午在一次记者招待会上发表声明说：“我可以肯定，在这些严酷的考验的日子里，中国将永远站在埃及的最好的和真挚的朋友的前列。
    “在埃及人民发出要求援助的呼吁后二十四小时内，中国就非常漂亮地响应了这个呼吁。”他说，中国政府在埃及的名义下开了两千万瑞士法郎的户头，让它购买它在困难中所需要的任何物资。
    拉加卜大使接着说：“在周恩来总理把这个决定交给我的时候，他告诉我，他感到很遗憾，由于现有的瑞士法郎的外汇的数字，不能够援助更多的款项，而别的国家的货币一拨给埃及的时候就会遭到冻结。”
    他透露，埃及所要求的数以千吨计的粮食和其他救济物资正在运往埃及的途中。他又说：“中国红十字会捐给埃及红新月会十七万瑞士法郎，作为战争中的死伤人员的救济基金。一个护士和医生工作团正在准备中，以备埃及万一的需要。”
    埃及大使继续说道，除了中国所提供的物质援助以外，埃及驻北京大使馆每天都接到千百封学生、工人、农民和其他的人写来的信。他说，有些信是十岁以下的小学生写来的。
    拉加卜大使说，中国正在登记志愿人员。但是他说，他还没有接到他的政府对关于志愿人员去埃及问题的答复。他说：“埃及对于联合国组织充分执行它所作出的关于从埃及领土撤退一切侵略军的决议仍然怀有很大的信任和信心。”
    但是，这位大使警告说：“万一联合国的决议不能实施——我们都希望这种情况不会发生——，埃及政府可以随意采取任何行动。”
    拉加卜大使谴责英法的侵略行为，认为这是“最残暴的进攻”，他说：“正在走向死亡的帝国主义不会在这个世界上留一个清白名声的。
    “英法对埃及国土的进攻和滥炸城市，这在帝国主义的历史上写下了最黑暗的篇章之一，全世界在今后的世代中绝不会忘记它。”
    拉加卜大使宣称：“塞得港的英勇斗争将永远记载在英勇斗争的历史中。帝国主义这一次得到了非常严厉的教训，它不得不在再对爱好自由的国家发动进攻之前彻底地考虑这个教训。”
