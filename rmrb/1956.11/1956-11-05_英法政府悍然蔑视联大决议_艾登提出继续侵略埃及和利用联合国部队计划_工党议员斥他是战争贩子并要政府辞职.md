Xinhua News Agency, London, November 4th: British Prime Minister Eden announced in the House of Commons on the 3rd that Britain and France had decided to reject the ceasefire resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly emergency session and continue military aggression against Egypt. Opposition leader Gaitskell believed that Eden's words were "the most unfortunate speech made in the House of Commons since 1939," and he accused the government of "openly defying the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly."

Eden said in an emergency meeting of the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 3rd that the British and French governments "still believe that police action must be completed quickly to stop the war currently threatening the Suez Canal, prevent the recurrence of such a war, and pave the way for a decisive solution to the Arab-Israeli war—which threatens to disintegrate many countries."

Eden then put forward three conditions, believing that military action could only be stopped if these three conditions were met:

1.  The governments of Egypt and Israel agree to allow a United Nations force to maintain peace.
2.  The United Nations decides to establish and maintain such a force until a peaceful Arab-Israeli settlement is reached and until a satisfactory agreement is reached on the Suez Canal issue, both of which are guaranteed by the United Nations.
3.  Before the United Nations force is established, the belligerents agree to allow a limited number of British and French troops to be stationed between the belligerents immediately.

Opposition leader Gaitskell said in his speech that the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly required the parties engaged in hostilities to agree to an immediate ceasefire and to stop transporting military forces and weapons into the region. He said, "Unfortunately, the news that British aircraft are continuing and intensifying bombing, and the Prime Minister's statement, make it perfectly clear that the British government is not implementing this recommendation. We are faced with a situation in which our government is openly defying the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly. For our part, we can only say that we believe such a practice is absolutely regrettable."

Gaitskell questioned Eden's three conditions, saying that the opposition party did not believe it was Britain's responsibility to stipulate any conditions. He said that it was its responsibility to accept the majority decision.

Gaitskell said that the Suez Canal was blocked. Therefore, far from facilitating the passage of ships through the Suez Canal, the government's actions had the opposite effect.

Gaitskell said that all the government had done was to interfere in Egypt, which had clearly been attacked by Israel. "What they have done is bomb many civilian and military facilities in Egypt. What they have done is destroy all confidence in collective security."

He continued, all the government has already done is to destroy the United Nations system, which the Prime Minister once called "the hope of mankind."

When talking about the proposed United Nations police force, Gaitskell questioned, what reason is there for such a police force to operate in the canal area? Does this mean that Egypt must be forced to accept the eighteen-nation proposal? Why involve the solution of the Suez Canal issue here? Gaitskell said that Eden's proposal disregarded the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly.

Gaitskell called for Eden to resign, saying, "If Britain is to be saved from the predicament into which the government has plunged it, there is only one way, and that is to change the leadership of the government."

He concluded, "We must have a new government and a new prime minister."

His words aroused warm applause.

The emergency meeting of the House of Commons lasted a total of three hours. At the end of the debate, the chaotic situation in the meeting hall was rarely seen in many years. Labor MPs waved the documents in their hands, shouted "warmongers," and demanded that the government resign.

Xinhua News Agency, November 4th: Paris dispatch: The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a formal statement on November 3, rejecting the ceasefire resolution of the United Nations General Assembly. The statement said that after considering the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, the French government, together with the British government, decided to continue to intensify their military operations against Egypt.

The statement then put forward three conditions for stopping the attack on Egypt, which were exactly the same as the three conditions put forward by British Prime Minister Eden in the House of Commons.

The same day's United Press news quoted Paris political commentators as saying: Britain and France will try their best to argue that the British and French troops should become the core of any "international police force" under the auspices of the United Nations.

    英法政府悍然蔑视联大决议
    艾登提出继续侵略埃及和利用联合国部队计划
    工党议员斥他是战争贩子并要政府辞职
    据新华社伦敦4日电　英国首相艾登3日在下院宣布，英法决定拒绝联合国大会紧急会议通过的停火决议，继续在埃及进行军事侵略。反对党领袖盖次克尔认为艾登的话是“从1939年以来在下院所作的最不幸的发言”，他斥责政府是“公开蔑视联合国大会的决议”。
    艾登3日下午在下院紧急会议上发言时说，英法两国政府“仍然认定，必须赶紧完成警察行动以停止目前正在威胁着苏伊士运河的战争，阻止这种战争的再起，并且为决定性地解决阿拉伯和以色列战争——它有瓦解许多国家之势——开辟道路”。
    艾登接着提出了三个条件，他认为，只有这三个条件得到满足，才可以停止军事行动。这三个条件是：
    一、埃及和以色列两国政府同意让一支联合国部队来保持和平。
    二、联合国决定建立并维持这种部队，直到阿拉伯—以色列的和平解决办法得以达成，直到关于苏伊士运河问题取得令人满意的协议，而这两项协议又都得到联合国的保证的时候为止。
    三、在联合国部队建立以前，交战双方同意立即让英法军队中人数有限的部队驻扎在交战双方之间。
    反对党领袖盖次克尔发言说，联合国大会通过的决议要求从事敌对行动的各方同意立即停火，并且停止把军事部队和武器运进这个地区。他说，“不幸的是，英国飞机继续而且是加强轰炸的消息以及首相发表的声明都完全清楚地表明，英国政府并没有执行这个建议。我们面临着我们的政府公然蔑视联合国大会的决议的情况。在我们方面，我们只能说，我们认为这样的做法是绝对令人遗憾的。”
    盖次克尔在质问艾登规定的三个条件时说，反对党认为，规定任何条件不是英国的本分。他说，接受多数决定才是它的责任。
    盖次克尔说，苏伊士运河被封锁了。因此，远没有为船只通过苏伊士运河提供方便，政府的行动刚好起了相反的效果。
    盖次克尔说，政府所做的一切是干涉显然已受到以色列进攻的埃及。“他们所做的是轰炸埃及的许多平民和军事设施。他们所做的是摧毁对集体安全的一切信心。”
    他继续说，政府所已经做的一切是要摧毁曾被首相一度说成是“人类的希望”的联合国的制度。
    盖次克尔在谈到建议中的联合国警察部队时质问道，到底有什么理由要这样的警察部队在运河地区活动呢？这是不是说，埃及必须被迫接受十八国建议？为什么把解决苏伊士运河的问题牵连到这里面去？盖次克尔说，艾登的建议蔑视了联合国大会的决议。
    盖次克尔在要求艾登辞职时说，“如果英国要从政府已经使它陷入的那种困境中得救，那只有一条道路，就是改变政府的领导。”
    他最后说，“我们必须有新的政府和新的首相。”
    他的话引起了热烈的掌声。
    这次下院紧急会议一共进行了三小时。在辩论结束的时候，会议厅内混乱不堪的情况是多年以来所少见的。工党议员挥舞着手里的文件，大叫“战争贩子”，并且要求政府辞职。
    新华社4日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部11月3日发表正式声明，拒绝接受联合国大会的停火决议。声明说，法国政府同英国政府在考虑了联合国大会决议以后，决定继续加紧它们对埃及的军事行动。
    声明接着提出了停止进攻埃及的三项条件，这三项条件和英国首相艾登在下院提出的三项条件完全一样。
    同一天的合众社消息援引巴黎政治评论家的话说：英法将竭力主张，英法的军队应当成为在联合国主持下的任何“国际警察部队”的核心。
