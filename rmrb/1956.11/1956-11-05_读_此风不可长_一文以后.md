    After Reading "This Trend Must Not Be Encouraged"
    Editor's Note: The editorial department frequently receives opinions from readers after reading the newspaper. They enthusiastically express their views and attitudes towards the events or issues reported in our newspaper. To further strengthen the connection between the newspaper and its readers and to enrich the content of the newspaper, we have established a special column "Reader's Comments" to publish such contributions.
    Below are some opinions written by readers after reading the article "This Trend Must Not Be Encouraged" published on the third page of our newspaper on October 6th. That article exposed the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Commerce for using its privilege to prioritize the supply of certain valuable commodities to some leading cadres in the province. Some readers expressed their firm opposition to this practice; a few readers believed that this was the right thing to do. Now, we have selected and published some of these letters from both sides below.
    "This Trend" Has Not Stopped
    After the publication of "This Trend Must Not Be Encouraged," a similar situation recently occurred in a commercial department in Heilongjiang Province. The situation is as follows:
    On October 8th, a purchasing agent from the Harbin No. 1 Department Store went to the Heilongjiang Provincial Department Store Wholesale Station to allocate goods. A section chief named Sun, who was in charge of allocating watches, said: "Let's allocate all the Roman watches that have come this time to you." Then Section Chief Sun said: "A total of ten of these watches have arrived. The station will keep seven, and you can take the rest back!" In this way, seven-tenths of the Roman watches were divided up in the station's office. It is said that such situations are "commonplace" in Harbin.
    When will this bad phenomenon disappear? 　　　　　　　Wu Ming
    Privileged Thinking is at Work
    After reading Comrade Wen Ji's article "This Trend Must Not Be Encouraged," we fully support Comrade Wen's opinion.
    We believe that Deputy Director Shi of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Commerce and Director Zhang of the Finance and Trade Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee have some bad ideas from the old society in their minds. It seems that being an "official" makes one superior in everything and entitled to privileges, even to the point of treating the people's department store as a privately owned shop.
    It is even more wrong for Deputy Director Shi to take dozens of watches worth 9,000 yuan from the department store wholesale station with an official letter without paying for them to this day.
    We request the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee to seriously deal with these issues. 　　　　　　Wen Haoji, Shi Zailai
    Violating Financial Discipline
    I was very angry when I saw the "secret store" run by the Harbin Department Store, as exposed in the article "This Trend Must Not Be Encouraged." In particular, it is even more wrong that the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Commerce took fifty "Roman" watches from the Heilongjiang Provincial Department Store Wholesale Station in July this year for the use of leading cadres of the organization, and has not paid a penny to this day. This is not only a problem of them using commercial privileges, but also a violation of national financial discipline. It has prevented the recovery of 9,000 yuan in cash for three months, which has affected the country's capital turnover. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant departments conduct a prompt inspection and handling. Min

    This is the Right Thing to Do
    After reading Comrade Wen Ji's article "This Trend Must Not Be Encouraged" published on the third page of the People's Daily on October 6th, I have different opinions regarding how commercial departments should manage and sell valuable or rare high-end goods. I think there are only a few ways to sell these sought-after commodities: one is to put them on display in the store for buyers to snap up; another is not to put them on display in the store, but to sell them to organizations and groups; or another method is to compromise the above two methods. Which method of selling goods is better? Snapping up is detrimental to both the customer and the store, because the customer has to waste time queuing, and it is difficult to buy satisfactory goods in a crowded rush. At the same time, the order of the store is not well maintained, and haven't some stores already had their counters broken by the crowd?
    The purchase of high-value commodities requires higher purchasing power. In order to adapt to the increased purchasing power of these leading cadres and experts with higher wage incomes after the wage reform, commercial departments should provide them with a portion of high-value commodities. Is it worthy of criticism to allow leading cadres and experts to reduce the time spent queuing to buy goods, and to spend more time on their work? If it is thought that leading cadres and experts should all queue up to buy goods in the same way, I think how is this different from the views of egalitarians?
    I also thought of some situations, such as providing pork to factories and hospitals first, and providing good pork to experts; hospitals have special clinics for leading cadres..., are these all things that "must not be encouraged"?
    It is said that employees of the railway department have a system of riding trains without paying fares; coal miners have a rule of burning coal without paying for it. Then, since commercial department personnel do not have permission to buy rare commodities with priority, is it considered a "privilege" even to fulfill a little responsibility to supply good commodities to leading cadres and experts with priority? 　　　　　　　Hongcai

### 读“此风不可长”一文以后

    读“此风不可长”一文以后
    编者按　编辑部经常收到读者在读报以后寄来的意见，他们热情地对本报报道的事件或问题提出自己的看法，表示自己的态度。为了进一步密切报纸和读者的联系，充实报纸的内容，我们特设“读报杂感”专栏，发表这一类的稿件。
    下面是一些读者读了本报10月6日第三版发表的“此风不可长”一文以后写出的意见。那篇文章揭发了黑龙江省商业厅利用特权，把某些名贵的商品优先供应给该省的某些领导干部。有些读者对这种作法表示坚决反对；个别读者认为这样做是应该的。现在，我们把这两方面的来信选择一部分刊登在下面。
    “此风”仍未息
    “此风不可长”一文发表之后，类似情况最近又在黑龙江省的一个商业部门里发生了。事情经过是这样的：
    10月8日，哈尔滨市第一百货商店的进货员到黑龙江省百货批发站去拨货，该站负责拨表的一位孙科长说：“这次来的罗马牌的表全部拨给你们吧。”接着孙科长又说：“这种表一共来了十块，站里留下七块，剩下的你拿回去吧！”就这样，在该站的办公室里就把罗马牌表瓜分掉十分之七。据说，像这样的情况在哈尔滨是“屡见不鲜”的。
    什么时候才能使这种坏现象绝迹呢？　　　　　　　吾鸣
    特权思想在作怪
    我们看了闻集同志写的“此风不可长”一文后，完全支持闻同志的意见。
    我们认为黑龙江省商业厅史副厅长和中共黑龙江省委财贸部张部长的脑子中存在有旧社会的一些坏思想，似乎作“官”的一切都超人一等，就享有特权，甚至把人民的百货公司当成了私人开的店。
    史副厅长凭公函从百货公司批发站拿走价值九千元的几十块手表，至今不给钱，更是不对的。
    我们要求中共黑龙江省委严肃处理这些问题。　温好伋　时再来
    违犯了财政纪律
    我看到“此风不可长”一文中所揭发的哈尔滨市百货公司举办“秘密商店”的事情感到很气愤。尤其是黑龙江省商业厅在今年7月向黑龙江省百货批发站拿走的五十块供机关首长使用的“罗马”表，至今分文未付，更是不对的。这不仅是他们利用商业特权问题，而且是违犯国家财经纪律的问题。使九千元的现金三个来月的时间未回笼，影响了国家的资金周转，因此我建议有关部门迅速进行检查处理。民
    这样作是对的
    看了人民日报10月6日第三版登载的闻集同志写的“此风不可长”后，关于对名贵商品或稀有的高档货，商业部门应该怎样掌握和销售的问题，我有不同的意见。我想出售这些供不应求的商品的方法不外有以下几种：一种是摆在商店里让购买者去抢购；一种是不摆在商店里，按机关、团体分售；或者再一种方法就是把上面两种办法折中一下。哪一种出售商品的方法好呢？抢购，对顾主和商店都是不利的，因为顾主要浪费时间去排队，并且挤挤慌慌地也难买到可心的商品。同时，商店的秩序也不好维持，有的商店不是已经把柜台给挤坏了吗？
    对高贵商品的购买，是要有较高的购买力的。为了适应这些工资收入较高的首长和专家们在工资改革以后购买力增长的情况，商业部门是应当供给他们一部分高贵商品的。让首长和专家们减少些排队购货的时间，而把更多的时间用于工作，难道这是值得责难的吗？如果认为首长和专家们都要一律同样地去排队购买，我想这又与平均主义者的观点有什么不同呢？
    我又想到这样一些情况，对猪肉，先供应给工厂和医院，把好猪肉供给专家；医院里设有为首长们诊病的特诊室……，这些都是属于“不可长”么？
    据说铁路部门的职工有坐火车不付车费的制度；煤矿工人有烧煤不掏煤钱的规定。那么商业部门的人员既然没有自己优先买到稀有商品的许可，就连尽一点把好商品优先供应给首长和专家们的责任，也算是“特权”吗？　　　　鸿彩
