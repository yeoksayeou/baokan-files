Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 24th: Soviet experts assisting China in surveying the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway recently helped surveying personnel select a more ideal route. This eliminates the need to construct a large tunnel, originally required, that would have been two and a half kilometers long, potentially saving more than 3.8 million yuan in investment.

When railway surveyors were initially selecting a route west of Lanzhou, they believed that although the terrain on the south bank of the Yellow River was relatively flat, there was an 800-meter-long section of mountainous area with geological conditions similar to those of severe landslide and mudslide zones. Therefore, the preliminary decision was to move the route to the north bank of the Yellow River, which would require passing through the steep Bapan Gorge and excavating a large tunnel longer than the Qinling Tunnel on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Soviet experts believed that the situation on the south bank of the Yellow River still warranted further investigation. They went deep into the field with Chinese technicians and discovered that these gravels were originally caused by rock cracking and weathering, not landslides. After research, the originally selected route on the north bank of the Yellow River was decided to be moved to the south bank of the Yellow River.

    苏联专家为兰青铁路选线
    一条线路节省投资三百多万元
    据新华社兰州24日电　帮助我国勘测兰（州）青（海）铁路的苏联专家，最近帮助勘测人员选定了一条比较理想的线路，减少了原来需要修筑的一座二公里半长的大隧道，可以节省投资三百八十多万元。
    铁路勘测人员原来在兰州西面选择线路的时候，认为黄河南岸的地势虽然比较平坦，但是有一段八百公尺长的山地，地质情况和严重的塌方滑坡地区很相似，因此，初步决定把线路移在黄河北岸，这样，就要穿过险峻的八盘峡，开凿一座比宝成铁路上秦岭隧道还长的大隧道。苏联专家认为黄河南岸的情况仍旧有进一步研究的必要，就和中国的技术人员深入现场调查，发现这些碎石原来是岩石裂开风化造成的，并不是坍方。经过研究，原选的黄河北岸线决定移到黄河南岸。
