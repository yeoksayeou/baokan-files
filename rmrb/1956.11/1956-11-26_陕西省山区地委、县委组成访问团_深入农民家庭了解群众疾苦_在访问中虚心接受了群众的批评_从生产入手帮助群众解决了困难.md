Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 23rd: By mid-November, the activity of key visits to the people organized by the Chinese Communist Party in all mountainous areas of Shaanxi Province had come to an end.

This visit started in September and October. The Party committees of various mountainous prefectures and counties in the Communist Party of China dispatched cadres to form visiting delegations (groups), led by leading cadres, to go to the countryside. Many remote and barren deep mountainous areas that county-level and above leading cadres rarely visited in the past were also visited this time.

During the visits, cadres went to farmers' homes to have heart-to-heart talks, some lived in poor farmers' homes, to understand the problems existing in their lives. Some cadres also held small-scale forums of three or five households, or went to the fields to understand the production situation of the people in the mountainous areas.

The masses in various places criticized the leading organs for not paying enough attention to the work in the mountainous areas, rarely conducting in-depth investigations and research in the mountainous areas, and often using methods to guide production in the plains to guide production in the mountainous areas. For example, this year, the blind promotion of close planting and good varieties of corn such as "Golden Queen" in the mountainous areas resulted in reduced production. In particular, since the basic realization of agricultural cooperation this year, the leading organs have relaxed their leadership over diversified operations in the mountainous areas, and some have even restricted it in many ways. In addition, the downgrading and price suppression when purchasing mountain goods and local specialties have greatly reduced the income of the people in the mountainous areas. The work style of coercion and command among cadres in the mountainous areas is quite common. The masses put forward many opinions on these issues. At the same time, they put forward many suggestions and requirements on how to change the current production and living conditions in the mountainous areas.

The visiting delegations (groups) humbly adopted these criticisms and suggestions, and made public self-criticisms to the masses on the shortcomings and errors in their leadership work. At the same time, in coordination with district and township cadres, they started with production and solved the problems that the farmers urgently needed to solve. The autumn crops of the first agricultural cooperative in Guofenglous Township, Shanyang County, suffered heavy losses, and the masses were uneasy. The visiting cadres assisted the agricultural cooperative in studying and solving the production, supply, and marketing problems in developing sideline production, which satisfied the members. When the visiting group of the Nan County Committee of the Communist Party of China visited Liziping and Taiyangping villages, the director of the agricultural cooperative here, Tang Xingyou, suppressed democracy and intimidated the members. In the past, the members dared not raise their opinions. This time, the visiting group adopted the form of a democratic management inspection meeting to enable the members to boldly put forward criticisms and suggestions for improving leadership. The director of the cooperative made a sincere self-criticism and solved the problems that had not been solved for a long time.

The visiting delegations (groups) also gave strong assistance to the production and living difficulties of the people in the mountainous areas. Fourteen counties, including Nanzheng and Lueyang, issued more than 10,000 yuan in loans to agricultural cooperatives and farmers who had difficulties in production, assisted them in purchasing the necessary means of production, and solved the difficulties of many farmers who lacked food and clothing. For farmers who are currently living in poverty, only ten counties, including Shangxian and Zhidan, have issued more than 5,000 yuan in relief funds to more than 300 farmers. Various places have also distributed clothing and bedding to poor households lacking winter clothes and cotton quilts. Many visiting delegations (groups) had doctors participating, providing free medical treatment to farmers in the mountainous areas.

    陕西省山区地委、县委组成访问团
    深入农民家庭了解群众疾苦
    在访问中虚心接受了群众的批评
    从生产入手帮助群众解决了困难
    新华社西安23日电　到本月中旬止，在陕西全省山区，中共组织重点访问人民群众的活动已经全部结束。
    这次访问是在9、10月间开始的，中共各山区地委、县委都抽调干部组成访问团（组），由领导干部率领下乡。过去县以上领导干部很少到过的许多边远贫瘠的深山区，此次也进行了访问。
    访问中，干部们挨门逐户深入到农民家庭中去谈心，有的就住在贫苦的农民家中，了解他们生活上存在的问题。有些干部还普遍召开了三、五户的小型座谈会，或者到田间去了解山区人民生产情况。
    各地群众对领导机关不够重视山区工作，很少到山区来深入调查研究，常以指导平川地区的方法指导山区生产提出批评。例如，今年在山区盲目推广密植和“金皇后”玉米等良种，造成减产。特别是从今年基本上实现农业合作化以后，领导机关放松了对山区的多种经营领导，有的反而多方限制，加之对山货土特产收购时压级压价，大大减少了山区人民的收益。而山区干部中的强迫命令作风相当普遍。对这些问题群众提出许多意见。同时对如何改变山区生产、生活现状提出不少建议和要求。
    访问团（组）虚心采纳了这些批评、建议，就领导工作中的缺点、错误向群众进行了公开检讨。同时，协同区、乡干部从生产入手，解决了农民迫切需要解决的问题。山阳县过风楼乡第一农业社的秋作物受灾损失很大，群众思想不安，访问干部协助农业社研究解决了开展副业生产上的产、供、销问题，社员感到满意。中共南郑县委访问组在李子坪、太阳坪两村访问时，这里的农业社主任唐兴有压制民主，威吓社员，过去社员不敢提意见。此次访问组采取民主办社检查会的形式使社员们大胆提出批评和改进领导的建议，社主任作了诚恳的检讨，解决了长期未能解决的问题。
    对山区人民的生产和生活上的困难，访问团（组）也给以有力的帮助。南郑、略阳等十四个县给生产上有困难的农业社和农户发放了一万多元贷款，协助他们添置了必要的生产资料，解决了不少农户缺少口粮和被服的困难。对目前生活贫困的农民，仅商县、志丹等十县就给三百多户农民发了五千多元救济款。各地还给缺冬衣、棉被的贫困户发了衣被。许多访问团（组）都有医生参加，为山区农民免费治病。
