Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 22nd: Egyptian President Nasser said on November 21st: "Egypt's policy is one of national independence. Egypt and the Egyptian people value this independence more than life itself."

In a written statement, he said that his country is independent of both the Eastern and Western blocs. He said, "Just as Egypt is determined to maintain its political independence, Egypt is equally determined to maintain its ideological independence." He said he would never be a stooge of any country.

Nasser said: "The Egyptian revolutionary government is committed to the universal ideals of justice between people, justice between countries, equality for all people and all countries in the world, and individual and personal freedom. In order to achieve these ideals, the new Egypt will work according to its own religious doctrines and cultural traditions."

While emphasizing national independence, Nasser also emphasized the need for international cooperation. He said: "Egypt deeply understands the necessity of international cooperation. Because it is located at one of the world's historic crossroads, it is impossible for it not to have this understanding. Egypt hopes to cooperate with other countries—a glorious cooperation. Specifically, Egypt particularly insists on upholding international law." He said: "Not only that, I also hope that international law can be expanded to meet the needs of the complex modern world."

Nasser refuted the claim that he was trying to establish a vast Arab empire. He said: "Like all other countries, Egypt has a special fraternal feeling for those countries that share a common cultural tradition with it and those former colonial countries that are also in the stage of transition to independence, democracy, and economic progress. However, the idea of ​​trying to create an Arab empire or trying to control such an empire is something that Egypt and I personally abhor."

Nasser said that Arab countries are working towards the ideal of fruitful cooperation. "But like Egypt, every Arab country cherishes its national integrity. The concept of Arab imperialism is a foreign fabrication, or ignorant foreign propaganda, or something even worse."

Nasser pointed out that the basic goal of his government is to "greatly improve the economic and social conditions of the Egyptian people as a free and independent nation."

He said: I am really concentrating my government's strength to achieve this goal. However, it cannot be done until some very urgent problems are resolved.

Nasser said: "I ask the governments of all countries in the world, every child of God, to make a concerted and earnest effort to seek a just and glorious solution to these problems."

    埃及对民族独立比对生命还宝贵
    纳赛尔发表声明强调民族独立和国际合作
    新华社22日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统纳赛尔11月21日说：“埃及的政策是民族独立的政策。埃及和埃及人对这种独立比对生命本身还宝贵。”
    他在一篇书面声明中说，他的国家无论对东方集团还是对西方集团都是独立的。他说，“正和埃及决心保有政治上的独立一样，埃及同样也决心保有意识形态上的独立”。他说，他永远不会做任何国家的走卒。
    纳赛尔说：“埃及革命政府致力于人与人之间保持公正、国与国之间保持公正、一切人和一切国家在世界上平等相处以及个人和人身自由这样一些普遍的理想。为了实现这些理想，新埃及将根据它自己的宗教教义和文化传统进行努力。”
    纳赛尔在强调民族独立的同时，又强调要进行国际合作。他说：“埃及深深了解进行国际合作的必要性。由于它正位于世界的历史性的十字路口之一，因此它不可能没有这种了解。埃及希望同其他国家进行合作——一种光荣的合作。具体地说，埃及特别坚持维护国际法。”他说：“不仅如此，我还希望国际法能够扩大到足以满足复杂的现代世界的需要。”
    纳赛尔驳斥所谓他正试图建立一个广泛的阿拉伯帝国的说法。他说：“同其他一切国家一样，埃及对于同它是有共同文化传统的那些国家和同它同样处在过渡到独立、民主和经济进步这一阶段的那些前殖民地国家也怀有一种特别的手足之情。但是，企图创立一个阿拉伯帝国或是企图控制这样一个帝国这种想法是埃及和我本人深恶痛绝的。”
    纳赛尔说：阿拉伯国家正朝着进行有成效的合作这种理想的方向努力。“但是正像埃及一样，每个阿拉伯国家都珍爱它的国家完整。关于阿拉伯帝国主义的概念是外国捏造的说法，或者是出于无知的外国宣传，或者是更要糟糕的东西。”
    纳赛尔指出，他的政府的基本目标是要“大大改善作为自由和独立的民族的埃及人民的经济和社会状况”。
    他说：我切实集中我的政府的力量来实现的正是这个目的。但是，在某些非常迫切的问题解决以前，是不能够那样做的。
    纳赛尔说：“我要求全世界所有国家的政府、要求上帝的每一个儿女，共同进行认真的努力来求得这些问题的公正而光荣的解决。”
