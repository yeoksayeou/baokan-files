    Northwest Engineering Bureau Corrects Wasteful Practices
    Mobilizes the Masses to Launch a Struggle for Thrift
    (Our Newspaper News) Since the beginning of September, the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the Northwest Bureau) system has mobilized all employees to launch a comprehensive campaign to conserve resources and oppose waste.
    The Northwest Bureau suffered serious waste in the first half of the year. Not only did it fail to complete the cost reduction plan, but it also lost four to five million yuan (part of which could be recovered from the client), and its loan debts reached more than 14 million yuan. Due to poor material management, unreasonable use, and operational errors, 274 tons of steel, 1,856 tons of cement, and 1,559 cubic meters of wood were wasted in the first half of the year. These materials could have been used to build approximately 50,000 to 60,000 square meters of mixed-structure houses. Under the guiding ideology of "the more people, the better," it strived to transfer more labor, resulting in a large amount of worker idleness. This resulted in a loss of more than 49,000 workdays in the first half of the year. Adding the overtime workdays, the wage fund overspent a total of 970,000 yuan in the first half of the year. They had thousands of machines, but their utilization rate was very low. Some units, for the sake of "being prepared for any eventuality," rented machinery even if they didn't use it, resulting in significant waste.
    Starting in September, the Northwest Bureau and its subordinate companies and work areas universally mobilized employees to expose and criticize wasteful phenomena, and from top to bottom, proposed comprehensive conservation measures, which were then discussed, supplemented, and revised from bottom to top. According to incomplete statistics for the third quarter, 330 tons of steel were saved by using methods such as cold-drawing of steel bars and spot welding of short materials. 224 tons of cement were saved by using dry-hard concrete, cement admixtures, and clinker-free cement. Many work areas made full use of old wood.
    In terms of labor utilization, they emphasized strictly controlling and allocating labor according to the labor plan. The Second Engineering Company also implemented a three-day labor force balancing method, unified balancing and allocating the labor force in each work area, solving the problem of insufficient labor and worker idleness between work areas.
    More importantly, after mobilizing the masses to expose and criticize past waste, the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the employees were enhanced, and the bureaucracy of the leadership was deeply criticized. Now, various management systems and conservation measures such as team-based economic accounting, material quota system, mixed work teams, and piece-rate wage system have been successfully implemented, and the workers are conducting mutual inspection and supervision. The wasteful phenomenon of “stepping on gold” on the site has been greatly improved. The leaders of the Northwest Bureau and its subordinate companies and work areas have initially established a comprehensive view of "more, faster, better, and more economical" from the lessons of the first half of the year, overfulfilling the third quarter plan by 5.2%, and making great progress in reducing costs.

### 西北工程管理局纠正浪费现象  发动群众开展节约斗争

    西北工程管理局纠正浪费现象
    发动群众开展节约斗争
    本报讯　9月初以来，西北工程管理总局（以下简称西管局）系统，发动全体职工开展了全面节约、反对浪费的斗争。
    西管局上半年浪费现象严重，不但没完成降低成本计划，反而赔了四、五百万元（其中有一部分还可以向甲方收回），贷款欠款达一千四百多万元。由于材料管理不善，使用不合理和操作错误，上半年浪费了钢材二百七十四吨，水泥一千八百五十六吨，木材一千五百五十九立方公尺。用这些材料大约可以建筑五、六万平方公尺混合结构的房子。在“人多好办事”的指导思想下，尽量争取多调劳动力，造成大量工人窝工。上半年为此损失了四万九千多个工日。再把加班加点的工日加在一起，上半年工资基金共超支了九十七万元。他们拥有数千台机械，但利用率很低。有些单位为了“有备无患”，有机械就租，租了来又不用，造成很大浪费。
    从9月份开始，西管局及所属各公司、工区普遍发动职工揭发批判浪费现象，自上而下地提出了全面节约措施，又自下而上地进行了讨论补充和修正。据三季度不完全的统计，由于采用了钢筋冷拉、短料点焊后使用等办法，节约了钢材三百三十吨。采用干硬性混凝土、水泥掺合料、无熟料水泥等办法，节约水泥二百二十四吨。很多工区充分利用了旧木料。
    在使用劳动力方面，他们重视了严格控制和按劳动计划调配劳动力的办法。第二工程公司还实行了三日劳动力平衡办法，统一平衡调配各工区的劳动力，解决了工区之间劳动力不足和窝工的现象。
    更重要的是，通过发动群众揭发批判过去的浪费现象以后，提高了职工的积极性和责任感，对领导上的官僚主义给了深刻的批判。现在，队组经济核算、限额领料、混合工作队、计件工资制等各项管理制度和节约措施顺利推行了，工人群众互相进行检查和监督。现场上
  “脚踏黄金”的浪费现象，有了极大的改善。西管局及所属各公司、工区的领导人员，从上半年的教训中初步树立了“多、快、好、省”的全面观点，超额5.2％完成了三季度计划，降低成本工作也有很大好转。
