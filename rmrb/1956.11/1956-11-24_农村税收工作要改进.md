    Rural Tax Work Needs Improvement
  　Gao Changren
    In the rural areas of Hunan Province, due to unreasonable situations in tax work, and also because some tax officials have a coercive command style and a purely task-oriented view, agricultural cooperatives have gradually developed a new contradiction with the tax departments since the summer when they began to develop diversified operations. In individual areas, this contradiction has affected the enthusiasm of agricultural cooperatives to develop diversified operations and engage in sideline production. The Nanzhushan Tax Office in Xiangtan County also levied a 5.3% income tax on the wage income of agricultural cooperative members who did odd jobs such as picking sand. In Liuyang County, some tax officials often went to the mountains to watch, and when they saw houses being built there, they rushed to collect timber tax for building the houses. One farmer spent only 300 yuan to build a house, but as a result, the tax authorities levied 180 yuan in taxes. Once, an agricultural cooperative sent someone to the street to sell 50 jin of fresh fish, and the Fangling Market Tax Office in Chaling County asked him to pay taxes. The cooperative member selling the fish asked to pay the tax after the fish was sold because he had no money, but the tax office detained the fish. As a result, the market dispersed, the fish rotted, and the agricultural cooperative still had to pay taxes according to the regulations. Huang Xinwu, a staff member of the Chuanshanping Tax Office in Xiangyin County, urged Hu Jianhe, a middle peasant, to pay brick and tile tax. When Hu Jianhe had no cash, Huang Xinwu even picked up a ladder and claimed he would dismantle the house. Farmers in these areas have a lot of complaints about the style of rural tax officials. Some farmers reflect: when working individually, there was no tax, but now that we are organized, we have to pay taxes.
    The main reason for this situation is that tax work has not kept up with the new situation after agricultural cooperation. Now, the rural economy has undergone fundamental changes, but the tax system is still basically the tax system before agricultural cooperation. Although the leading organs have also issued some supplementary regulations, they have not fundamentally and comprehensively solved the problem. At the same time, the thinking of tax officials is also lagging behind the situation. In many specific issues, they still treat today's collectivized farmers with the attitude and practices of the past towards rich peasants and speculators. In this way, contradictions constantly arise between the tax departments and the agricultural cooperatives. Many leaders of tax authorities only pursue more tax revenue, and rarely ask whether cadres are correctly implementing policies or following the mass line in their work. The Longhui County tax authorities once set "work quotas" for each tax cadre, believing that those who overfulfilled the tax collection task were advanced producers. As a result, some tax cadres in some areas developed a serious coercive command style.
    It is time to quickly change these wrong practices! It is time to fundamentally improve rural tax work!

    农村税收工作要改进
  　高长任
    在湖南省农村里，由于税收工作中有不合理的情况，又由于某些税收工作人员有强迫命令的作风和单纯的任务观点，农业社自今年夏季开展多种经营以来就和税收部门逐渐发生了一种新的矛盾。这种矛盾在个别地区已影响到农业社发展多种经营、从事副业生产的积极性。湘潭县南竹山税务所对农业社社员做挑砂子等零工的工资收入，也要征收5.3％的所得税。浏阳县有些税收工作人员经常跑到山上去了望，看到那里盖房子，就跑到那里去收盖房子的木料税。有一户农民盖房子只花三百元，结果却被税务机关征收了一百八十元的税。有一次，一个农业社派人上街卖五十斤鲜鱼，茶陵县舫舲市税务所要他交税。卖鱼的社员因身上没钱要求等鱼卖了再纳税，税务所便把鱼扣下来。结果，市场散了，鱼臭了，农业社还得照章纳税。湘阴县川山坪税务所工作人员黄心悟，向中农胡坚和催交砖瓦税，胡坚和没有现款，黄心悟竟搬起楼梯，声称要拆屋。这些地区的农民对农村税收工作人员的作风很有意见。有些农民反映：单干时不要税，组织起来反要收税了。
    产生这种情况的主要原因，是税收工作还没有赶上农业合作化以后的新形势。现在，农村经济已经发生根本变化，但税制基本上还是农业合作化以前的税制。领导机关虽然也发布了一些补充规定，但没有从根本上全面地解决问题。同时，税收工作人员的思想也还落在形势的后面，在许多具体问题上，仍然以过去对待富农、投机商人的态度和做法，来对待今天的已经集体化的农民。这样，就使税收部门和农业社之间不断地发生矛盾。许多税务机关领导人只追求多收税，对于干部在工作中是否正确执行政策，是否走群众路线，则很少过问。隆回县税务机关曾给每个税收干部制定“工作定额”，认为超额完成收税任务的便是先进生产者。部分地区的税收干部因此产生了严重的强迫命令作风。
    是赶快改变这种种错误作法的时候了！是从根本上改进农村税收工作的时候了！
