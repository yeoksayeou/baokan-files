Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, November 27th: A recent speech by Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy after returning home from the Middle East has aroused the anger of Pakistani politicians. In his speech, Suhrawardy said that those who oppose the Baghdad Pact are "spies bought by the enemy."

According to newspapers, people from the Dhaka Awami League believe that this is a "rash speech" that will hinder the actions already taken to eliminate divisions within the Awami League.

Yar Mohammad Khan, Chairman of the Dhaka Awami League and member of the East Pakistan Awami League Working Committee, pointed out in a speech that the East Pakistan Awami League Council has passed a resolution demanding the abolition of all military treaties concluded with foreign countries. He asked whether Suhrawardy was scolding the East Pakistan Awami League organization as spies bought by the enemy.

Bhashani, Chairman of the East Pakistan Awami League, said that he was worried about Pakistan's current policies.

Dhaka City Awami League staff criticized Suhrawardy's speech at a meeting held on November 22. A resolution passed at the meeting stated: "Pakistan has lost the friendship and goodwill of the Muslim world due to its participation in the Baghdad Pact and other treaties."

According to the "Morning Post" on November 26, a spokesman for the Pakistan Democratic Party, a political party participating in the East Pakistan United Government, said that Suhrawardy's speech "is clearly a slander against the Democratic Party."

The spokesman pointed out that Suhrawardy may lose the support of the twelve members of the Democratic Party parliamentary group, which has been fiercely criticizing the current foreign policy of the Pakistani government.

    硬说巴格达条约反对者是“特务”
    巴基斯坦总理的谈话激起政界公愤
    据新华社卡拉奇27日电　巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底最近从中东回国后发表的一篇谈话激起了巴基斯坦政界人士的愤怒。苏拉瓦底在他的那篇谈话中说，那些反对巴格达条约的人是“被敌人收买的特务”。
    据报纸报道，达卡人民联盟人士认为，这是一篇“轻率的谈话”，它会妨碍为了消除人民联盟内部的分裂而已经采取的行动。
    达卡人民联盟主席、东巴基斯坦人民联盟工作委员会委员雅尔·穆罕默德汗在一篇谈话中指出，东巴基斯坦人民联盟理事会已经通过了要求废除同外国缔结的一切军事条约的决议。他问道，苏拉瓦底是不是在责骂东巴基斯坦人民联盟组织是被敌人收买的特务呢？
    东巴基斯坦人民联盟主席巴沙尼说，他为巴基斯坦目前的政策担忧。
    达卡城人民联盟工作人员在11月22日举行的一次会议上批评苏拉瓦底的谈话。会议通过的一项决议说：“巴基斯坦由于参加了巴格达条约和其他条约，已经丧失了穆斯林世界的友谊和亲善”。
    据11月26日的“晨报”报道，参加东巴基斯坦联合政府的一个政党——巴基斯坦民主党的发言人说，苏拉瓦底的谈话“显然是诽谤民主党”。
    这位发言人指出，苏拉瓦底可能失去民主党议会党团十二个议员的支持，民主党议会党团一直在猛烈批评巴基斯坦政府现在的外交政策。
