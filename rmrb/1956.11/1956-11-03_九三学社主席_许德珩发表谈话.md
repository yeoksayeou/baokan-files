    Chairman of the Jiusan Society
    Xu Deheng Issues a Statement
    Today, Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, issued the following statement on the issue of British and French aggression against Egypt:
    Regardless of the opposition of world public opinion, the British and French colonialists, after instigating Israel to attack Egypt, brazenly launched an armed invasion of Egypt under the pretext of protecting the Suez Canal. The Egyptian people, in order to protect the security of their country and peace in the Middle East, are taking up arms to deal a head-on blow to the invaders. The 600 million Chinese people condemn this barbaric act of aggression by the British and French colonialists with irrepressible anger. We resolutely support the solemn statement issued by our government on November 1 regarding the British and French armed invasion of Egypt. We express our full support for the heroic Egyptian people who are resisting aggression and defending peace.
    As Indian Prime Minister Nehru rightly said, "In my diplomatic experience, I have never encountered a more blatant act of naked aggression than what Britain and France are trying to do." The British and French aggressors are the culprits who are destroying peace! No amount of clever words from Eden and Mollet can mask the hideous bandit faces of the British and French colonialists.
    The British and French aggression against Egypt is a serious test for the United Nations. The United Nations Security Council has made a resolution on six principles regarding the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal, providing a path for peaceful consultation to solve this problem. The Egyptian government has also stated more than once that it is willing to hold negotiations with Britain and France on the basis of not undermining sovereignty and dignity. However, Britain and France are now disregarding the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world, disregarding the principles of the UN Charter and the resolutions of the Security Council, and moving towards the dead end of destroying peace. The United Nations should immediately take effective measures to stop it.
    There is an old Chinese saying: "Those who play with fire will get burned." British and French colonialists! Is the end of the American invasion of Korea not a clear lesson for you? If you have not completely lost your senses, you should immediately pull back from the brink, stop all acts of aggression in Egypt, and return to the path of peaceful consultation that the people of the world, including the people of Britain and France, are eagerly hoping for. If you insist on pursuing a policy of aggression and a policy of war, then you will inevitably suffer the consequences.

    九三学社主席
    许德珩发表谈话
    九三学社主席许德珩今天就英、法侵略埃及问题发表谈话如下：
    英、法殖民主义者不顾全世界舆论的反对，在唆使以色列进攻埃及以后，竟以所谓保护苏伊士运河为借口，悍然发动了对埃及的武装进攻。埃及人民为了保护自己国家的安全和中东的和平，正拿起了武器给侵略者以迎头痛击。中国六万万人民怀着不可遏制的愤怒谴责英、法殖民主义者这种野蛮的侵略行为。我们坚决拥护我国政府11月1日所发表的关于英、法武装侵略埃及的严正声明。我们对于英勇地反抗侵略、保卫和平的埃及人民，表示全力支持。
    印度尼赫鲁总理说得好：“在我的外交经历中，我从来没有遇到过比英国和法国正在试图做的事更为粗暴的赤裸裸的侵略行为。”英法侵略者是破坏和平的罪人！艾登和摩勒的任何巧妙的言词也不能掩饰英、法殖民主义者狰狞的强盗面目了。
    英、法侵略埃及的行为对于联合国是一个严重的考验。联合国安全理事会曾经对苏伊士运河航行自由问题作出了六项原则的决议，给这个问题的解决提供了和平协商的途径，埃及政府也曾不止一次地声明，愿意在不损害主权和尊严的基础上，同英、法举行谈判。可是英、法现在竟然不顾世界人民的和平愿望，不顾联合国宪章的原则和安全理事会的决议，走向破坏和平的绝路。联合国应该立即采取有效措施，予以制止。
    中国有一句古话：“玩火者将自焚”。英、法殖民主义者们！美国侵略朝鲜的结局，对你们难道不是明显的教训吗？你们假如还没有完全失去理智，应该立刻悬崖勒马，停止在埃及的一切侵略行为，回到全世界人民、也是英、法两国人民所迫切期望的和平协商的道路上来。如果还要坚持侵略政策和战争政策，那么，你们必将自食其恶果。
