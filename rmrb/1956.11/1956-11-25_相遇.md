    Encounter
    Li Yong
    On Jinggang Mountain he dulled his bayonet,
    And shed fresh blood by the Dadu River,
    Fierce battles in Taihang exhausted his warhorse,
    Waving his saber he crossed the Yangtze!
    He has traveled over mountains and rivers,
    His body covered with war wounds,
    This battle-hardened hero,
    Now lays his hands on the blueprint for construction!
    We joyfully reminisce about our separation,
    Recalling the hard-fought times of the past,
    He tightly grasped my hands,
    And told me about the factory where he works.
    “In the city we liberated,
    A brand new factory has been built,
    The small grass hut of the command post back then,
    Has been transformed into an office building.
    In front of the factory is the Martyrs' Cemetery,
    The smoke from the chimneys drifts towards the graves,
    I planted red flowers and green grass in front of the graves,
    How many times have I seen the faces of the martyrs in my dreams!
    Who can say that I am old and weak,
    The fiery flames of youth surge in my chest,
    As long as there is a breath left in me,
    I will take on the cause of the martyrs!”
    Soon I got off the train to part,
    Wishing the old commander good health.
    He followed the speeding train,
    Dashing like an arrow straight ahead!

    相遇
    李涌
    在井岗山他用钝了刺刀，
    又把鲜血洒在大渡河旁，
    血战太行累死了战马，
    挥舞着军刀横渡长江！
    他走过了千山万水，
    身上布满战争的创伤，
    这位身经百战的英雄，
    又双手按在建设的蓝图上！
    我们欢乐地畅叙别情，
    回忆以往苦战的时光，
    他紧紧握住我的两手，
    向我述说他所在的工厂。
    “我们解放的那座城市，
    修起一座崭新的工厂，
    当时指挥部的小草屋，
    改建成办公的楼房。
    工厂前边是烈士公墓，
    烟囱的青烟飘向墓旁，
    我在墓前栽上红花绿草，
    多少梦中看见烈士的脸庞！
    谁能说我年老力衰，
    青春的烈火在我的胸中鼓荡，
    只要我一息尚存，
    便把先烈的事业担当！”
    不久我下车分别，
    祝老首长身体健康。
    他随着飞驰的列车，
    箭似地直奔前方！
