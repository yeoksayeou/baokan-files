    Xinhua News Agency report: Shanghai’s Second Bureau of Light Industry and four other units recently hired legal counsel. The hired individuals are lawyers formerly from the Shanghai Legal Counsel Office. They periodically work at the hiring units, providing timely assistance to the units on legal matters, offering consultations, and acting as agents in litigation.

    A housing dispute that administrative leaders had been negotiating for six months without resolution was recently resolved reasonably with the assistance of legal counsel. The dispute was that the Qingde Rubber Factory, under the Second Bureau of Light Industry, wanted to reclaim housing occupied by the No. 35 Hardware Production Cooperative of the Bureau of Handicrafts, because this occupation was hindering the production development and improvement of worker welfare at the Qingde Rubber Factory. However, the No. 35 Hardware Production Cooperative believed that it was currently difficult to relocate completely. Therefore, administrative leaders on both sides repeatedly negotiated without success. After Liang Jincheng, the legal counsel, arrived at the Second Bureau of Light Industry, he studied the dispute in detail, conducted on-site investigations, and pointed out at the negotiation meeting that the actions of the No. 35 Hardware Production Cooperative were illegal. He supported the reasonable suggestion of the Qingde Rubber Factory to reclaim the housing. At that time, in an atmosphere of obeying the law and mutual understanding, both parties agreed to adopt a gradual return method to resolve the dispute.

    Legal counsel also regularly receive staff and workers who need assistance at the units that hired them. Yang Cunzhong, legal counsel for the No. 1 Automotive Depot of the Public Utilities Bureau, during one reception, spent four hours drafting eight legal documents for staff and workers, including complaints about interference with family marriage.

    A worker from the Hengfeng Cotton Mill complained to the mill's legal counsel, Li Xue, that the mill should not have dismissed him. After investigating, Li Xue pointed out to the mill that the handling of this worker was in conflict with the law. The mill listened to this advice and eventually reinstated the worker.

    上海部分企业单位聘请法律顾问
    据新华社讯　上海市第二轻工业局等五个单位，不久前聘请了法律顾问。受聘的人是原在上海法律顾问处的律师，他们定期到主聘单位办公，及时帮助各单位对涉及法律方面的问题进行咨询、代理诉讼等工作。
    一件经过行政领导协商半年还没有解决的房屋纠纷，最近在法律顾问的协助下，得到了合理的解决。这件纠纷是：第二轻工业局所属庆德橡胶厂要收回手工业局第三五金生产合作社占用的房屋，因为这种占用已经妨碍了庆德橡胶厂的生产发展和工人福利的改善；而第三五金生产合作社认为目前要全部迁移确有困难。所以双方行政领导方面一再协商没有成功。法律顾问梁金城到第二轻工业局以后，详细地研究了这件纠纷，作了实地调查，并且在双方协商会上指出第三五金生产合作社的行为是违法的，他支持庆德橡胶厂收回房屋的合理意见。当时，双方在遵守法律、互相谅解的气氛中，同意采取逐步归还的办法来解决这件纠纷。
    法律顾问还定期在受聘单位接待需要帮助的职工群众。公用事业管理局汽车一场法律顾问杨存中在一次接待过程中，用四个小时为职工代写了妨害家庭婚姻的诉讼状等文书八件。
    恒丰棉纺织厂一个工人向厂的法律顾问李雪申诉厂方不应该开除他的工作，李雪经过调查，就向厂方提出对这个工人的处理有同法律相抵触的地方。厂方听取了这个意见，最后恢复了这个工人的工作。
