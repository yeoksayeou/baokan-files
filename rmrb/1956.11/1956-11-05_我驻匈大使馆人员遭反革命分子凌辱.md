Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 4th - News from Budapest states that in Budapest, where white terror is rampant, the Chinese Embassy in Hungary and Chinese personnel in Hungary are constantly subjected to humiliation by Hungarian counter-revolutionary elements. Counter-revolutionary elements attempted to dig out the five stars on the national flag on the Chinese Embassy's car. When personnel from the Chinese Embassy went out, Hungarian counter-revolutionary elements repeatedly and groundlessly insulted them. Some wanted to strip the personnel of the Chinese Embassy of their hats and clothes, and some said: "Why don't you roll back!" Chinese students in Hungary have also repeatedly suffered similar insults.

Personnel from other socialist countries stationed in Hungary have also become targets of provocation by counter-revolutionary elements, and their cars have often been shot at.

    我驻匈大使馆人员遭反革命分子凌辱
    新华社布拉格4日电　从布达佩斯来的消息说：在白色恐怖猖狂的布达佩斯，中国驻匈牙利大使馆和中国在匈牙利的人员不断受到匈牙利反革命分子的凌辱。反革命分子曾企图挖去中国大使馆汽车上的国旗上的五星。当中国大使馆人员外出时，匈牙利反革命分子一再对他们无端横加侮辱。有的要剥取中国大使馆人员的衣帽，有的说：“你们还不滚回去！”中国留匈学生也屡次遭到类似的侮辱。
    其他社会主义国家驻匈人员也成为反革命分子挑衅的对象，他们的汽车常常遭到枪击。
