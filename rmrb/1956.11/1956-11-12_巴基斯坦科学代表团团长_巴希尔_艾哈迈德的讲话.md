Dear friends!

I am greatly honored to be able to participate in the commemoration of the 90th anniversary of the birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great pioneer of the Chinese socialist revolution and the founder of the Republic of China. My colleagues in the Pakistani scientific community and myself are deeply grateful for your invitation and are deeply honored to be able to commemorate this great leader with you in the beautiful capital of your great country. Mr. Sun Yat-sen is not only a leader of China, but also a leader of all of Asia. As Asians, we are as proud of him as the Chinese people. Mr. Sun's theories, policies and endeavors, which finally led the Chinese people to freedom, also inspired the leaders of other Asian countries to fight against foreign rule and lead their people to freedom. Not only should China be grateful to Mr. Sun for what it is today, but Asia should also be deeply grateful to Mr. Sun for his guidance.

Mr. Sun came from a poor peasant family. From his own experience, he understood the fate of Chinese peasants. He felt injustice about this and believed that it was against human justice. He knew that as long as this unfair phenomenon was corrected, the fate of the Chinese people could be improved, and the Chinese society and economy could be transformed. He devoted himself to this work with all his strength. Unfortunately, he passed away too early, but the cause he planned and founded has been successfully completed by the current great leaders of China. As a result, his motherland is now prosperous and strong. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and his colleagues, China is developing and progressing rapidly. Freedom and equality have been realized, and the lives and work of farmers are happy and satisfying. Mr. Sun Yat-sen in heaven must have been comforted, because the goals he planned and fought for have been mostly achieved and are achieving glorious results.

The situation in most parts of Asia is now the same as it was in China during the time of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The people of Asia have received new inspiration from China's achievements. Under this inspiration, they are working hard in their own special environments and in their own ways to achieve the same achievements for their people. Their confidence has been greatly strengthened by knowing that they can get your goodwill, cooperation, and moral and material support.

We in Pakistan are also working hard to develop our country and improve the lives of our people. The vast majority of our people are poor and lack food and clothing. We scientists believe that science can raise them from this situation to a decent standard of living. We believe that science must be used to improve human well-being, to make life on this earth happy and fulfilling. We believe that through active cooperation between us, science can be developed in both our countries. We sincerely and warmly call for safeguarding peace and promoting peace; because without peace, we cannot achieve the goals we are striving for. We advocate vigorously striving for friendship and cooperation among Asian countries and all other countries with similar goals.

My colleagues and I have lived in your great country for more than half a month. We have seen how the new China is moving forward and have also seen some of the achievements that have already been made. In all of this, we have sensed the profound thoughts and immortal cause of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Along with our memories of this conference, we will take with us in our hearts the spark of inspiration, which is the spark of inspiration that the life and career of Mr. Sun Yat-sen have given us; we will draw great strength from here to serve the people of our country.

### 巴基斯坦科学代表团团长  巴希尔·艾哈迈德的讲话

    巴基斯坦科学代表团团长
    巴希尔·艾哈迈德的讲话亲爱的朋友们！
    我能参加中国社会主义革命的伟大先驱和创建中华民国的孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念大会，感到莫大的荣幸。巴基斯坦科学界的同事们和我自己深深感谢你们的邀请，并深以能在你们伟大国家的美丽首都同你们一起纪念这位伟大领袖为荣幸。孙中山先生不仅是中国的领袖，而且是全亚洲的领袖。作为亚洲人，我们同中国人民一样地以他而自豪。孙先生的那些终于引导中国人民获得自由的理论、政策和事业，也鼓舞了其他亚洲国家的领袖为反对外国统治和领导本国人民获得自由而奋斗。不但中国之所以有今天应当感谢孙先生，而且亚洲之所以有今天也应当深深地感谢于孙先生的先导。
    孙先生出身于贫苦的农家。他从自己的经验中了解中国农民的命运。他为此感到不平，并认为这是违反人类正义的。他知道只要纠正这种不公平的现象，就可以改善中国人民群众的命运，并改造中国的社会和经济。他对这个工作是全力以赴的。不幸他逝世过早，但他所计划的和创始的事业，已为中国现在的伟大领袖们成功地完成了。其结果是，他的祖国现在繁荣富强了。在毛泽东主席和他的同事们的英明领导下，中国正在迅速地发展和进步。自由平等实现了，农民的生活和工作是愉快的和令人满意的。孙先生在天之灵，一定得到了安慰，因为他所计划和为之而奋斗的目标，已经大部实现，并且正在获得光荣的成果。
    现在亚洲大部分地区的情况仍然和孙中山先生时代中国的情况一样。亚洲人民从中国的成就得到新的鼓舞。在这种鼓舞下，他们在自己各自的特殊环境里，用他们自己的方式，正在辛勤地工作着，为他们的人民争取同样的成就。由于他们知道可以得到你们的善意、合作以及道义的和物质的支援，这就大大地加强了他们的信心。
    我们在巴基斯坦也在为了发展我们的国家和改善我国人民的生活而辛勤地工作着。我国的广大人民是贫苦的，衣食不足的。我们科学工作者相信，科学可以把他们从这种境况中提高到一个像样的生活水平。我们相信，科学必须用以改进人的福利，用以使人在这个地球上的生活变得快乐和满足。我们相信，通过我们之间的积极合作，科学是能在我们两国得到发展的。我们真诚地和热烈地要求保障和平，促进和平；因为没有和平，我们就不能达到我们所要争取的目标。我们主张在亚洲国家之间以及具有相似的目标的一切其他国家之间，大力争取亲善和合作。
    我的同事们和我在你们伟大的国家住了半个多月。我们看到新中国是在怎样地前进，也看到了一些已有的成就。在所有这一切上，我们都觉察到孙中山先生的深厚思想和不朽的事业。连同我们对这次大会记忆，我们将要在我们的心里带去那种鼓舞的火花，这就是孙中山先生的一生和事业所给我们的鼓舞的火花；我们将从这里汲取巨大的力量以服务于我国的人民。
