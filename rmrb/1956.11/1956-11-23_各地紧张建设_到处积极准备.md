Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Dispatch: The first calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer plant in China, currently under construction in Leshan, Sichuan, has already produced its first batch of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer.

Calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer is a new type of quick-acting chemical phosphate fertilizer. It is made by mixing phosphate rock powder with magnesium-containing phosphorus material and firing it at high temperature. The Sichuan Provincial Chemical Industry Administration and the Leshan Phosphate Fertilizer Plant began joint research on this phosphate fertilizer in 1955, and succeeded after many experiments. Farm test results prove that it is not only highly effective but also has the characteristics of being insoluble in water, not requiring a mixed fermentation process, and being suitable for acidic and sandy soils.

It is expected that the factory will be fully completed by the end of this year, with an annual output of about 10,000 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch: A high-grade perfume factory has begun construction on the banks of the Pearl River in southern Guangzhou.

This state-owned Guangzhou Fragrant Flower Extraction Factory is scheduled to be completed in June next year. Its production process will be mechanized and continuous: fresh flowers will be sent to the flower extraction machine by conveyor belt, and then processed through liquid dissolution, filtration, clarification, and concentration to make perfume. According to the design capacity, this factory can produce two tons of fragrant flower concrete from six kinds of fragrant flowers, such as jasmine, rose, and white orchid, every year. The manufacture of these high-grade perfumes requires processing more than 1,000 tons of fresh flowers. In addition to meeting the needs of the Chinese people, the products can also be exported.

One of the main products of this perfume factory, jasmine concrete, will be a new product in the world. Jasmine is a special product of China. According to Chinese ancient books, the Chinese people have been planting jasmine for more than 2,000 years. It is especially abundant in Guangzhou.

This newspaper reports: The Hengfeng Shuttle Factory in Jiangxi Province is currently preparing to build a new factory, which is expected to be completed and put into production in May next year.

The shuttles produced by this factory are of good quality and low price, so textile factories in large cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Shenyang, Taiyuan, Chongqing, and Wuhan have placed orders with it. The preparation work is now in full swing. The new factory being expanded is located in Yingtan and is expected to be completed in May next year. The production volume of the new factory is very large, it is estimated that it can supply the shuttles used by more than forty textile mills with 50,000 spindles.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd: The Chongqing Plastics Factory is undergoing reconstruction. After the reconstruction of this factory is completed, the output will be more than ten times larger than now, and many new products needed by heavy industry and people's lives will also be produced.

The plastics industry is an important sector in modern chemical industry. Products made of different plastics have the characteristics of insulation, acid resistance, and non-conductivity. The construction of China's heavy industry needs more plastic products, such as electrical insulation materials needed by the power industry, bakelite bushings used in the metallurgical industry, acid-resistant pipes used in the chemical industry, and steering wheels for tractors and automobiles.

After the reconstruction of the Chongqing Plastics Factory is completed, it will produce large quantities of acid aldehydes, acid-resistant plastics and universal adhesives. These plastics can be made into the various industrial products mentioned above. In addition, the factory will also produce an amino plastic, which will be used to make all kinds of exquisite, flexible, and beautifully colored daily necessities for the people. This factory will be put into production in the fourth quarter of next year.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 22nd: After the dam site of the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station was selected, workers are conducting large-scale drilling in the riverbed of the dam site area, striving to determine the dam site axis before the end of this year.

Within the area of ​​several hundred meters of the already selected dam site area, employees have installed ten drilling rigs on the Yellow River. Some of these drilling rigs are mounted on iron boats, wooden boats, and wooden cages, and some are mounted on steel wire bridges. Now all the drilling rigs have been covered with warm sheds, which look like groups of small sailboats from a distance.

The Yellow River has a rapid current, and drilling in the riverbed will be the most arduous part of the exploration work of the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station. In order to submit relevant data for dam construction before the Yellow River freezes, the drilling workers are working day and night using a flow-line operation method.

Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, 22nd: In the Sishui Basin of the Sanmenxia Reservoir area of ​​the Yellow River, geological exploration work began on the 20th for the construction of a waterproof dam.

Sishui is located in the southwest of Shanxi Province and is a tributary of the Yellow River. The Sishui Basin in the lower reaches of Sishui has a well-known salt lake, and agricultural products are also abundant. In the future, when the Sanmenxia Reservoir dam retains floodwater to a certain amount, the water in the reservoir will invade the Sishui Basin. In order to protect this basin, a waterproof earth dam will be built at the southwest end of the basin.

The exploration work to collect design data for this earth dam project is undertaken by some members of the Sanmenxia Geological Exploration Team. They plan to drill twenty-two boreholes here, with a total drilling length of 1,500 meters, which is expected to be completed in January next year.

    各地紧张建设  到处积极准备
    第一个生产钙镁磷肥
    据新华社成都电　正在四川乐山建设的我国第一座钙镁磷肥厂，已经烧出第一批钙镁磷肥。
    钙镁磷肥是一种新的化学速效磷肥，它是用磷矿粉混合含镁磷物，经过高温烧成的。四川省化学工业管理局同乐山磷肥厂从1955年开始联合研究这种磷肥，经过许多次的试验，才得到成功。根据农场试验结果证明，它不仅肥效高，而且具有不溶解于水，不需要混合发酵过程，以及适应于酸性和砂质土壤的特点。
    预计这座厂将在今年底全部建成，每年产量在一万吨左右。
    把鲜花变成高级香料
    据新华社广州电　一座高级香料制造厂开始在广州市南部的珠江河畔动工兴建。
    这座国营广州香花浸提厂预定在明年6月建成。它的生产过程将是机械化的连续性生产：鲜花由传送带送到浸花机里，经过液解、过滤、澄清、浓缩制成香料。按照设计能力，这个厂每年可以出产茉莉、玫瑰、白玉兰等六种香花浸膏二吨。制造这些高级香料需要处理鲜花一千多吨。产品除了满足我国人民的需要以外，还可以出口。
    这个香料厂的主要产品之一——茉莉浸膏，将是世界上的新产品。茉莉花是中国的特产，根据中国古书的记载，中国人民栽种茉莉花已经有二千多年的历史。在广州尤多。
    鹰潭梭子厂
    本报讯　江西省横峰梭子厂目前正在筹建新厂，预计明年5月份竣工投入生产。
    这个厂生产的梭子质量好、价格低，所以上海、天津、北京、沈阳、太原、重庆、武汉等大城市的纺织厂都纷纷向它订货。现在筹建工作正在紧张进行。扩建的新厂建在鹰潭，预计明年5月竣工。新厂的生产量是很大的，估计可供给四十多个五万纱绽子的纺织厂所用的梭子。
    一改建，增产十倍
    新华社重庆22电　重庆塑料厂正在进行改建工程。这个厂改建完成以后，产量将比现在增大十倍以上，还将生产许多重工业和人民生活需要的新产品。
    塑料工业是现代化学工业中的重要部门。用不同塑料造成的产品，有绝热、耐酸和不导电等特点。我国重工业的建设，需要更多的塑料产品，如电力工业需用的电器绝缘器材，冶金工业用的胶木布司，化学工业用的耐酸管道，拖拉机、汽车的方向盘等。
    重庆塑料厂改建完成以后，将大批生产酸酫、耐酸等塑料和万能胶，这些塑料可以制成上述各种工业用品。另外，这个厂还将生产一种胺基塑料，用以制成各式精巧灵便，色泽美观的人民生活日用品。这个厂明年第四季度投入生产。
    在刘家峡河心
    新华社兰州22日电　刘家峡水电站的坝址选定以后，工人们正在坝址区进行大规模的河心钻探，争取在今年年底以前确定坝址轴线。
    在已经选定的坝址区的几百公尺范围内，职工们在黄河水上安设了十部钻机。这些钻机有的架在铁船、木船、木笼上，也有的架在钢丝桥上。现在各个钻机上都搭盖了暖棚，远远望去，好像成群结队的小帆船。
    黄河水流急，河心钻探将是刘家峡水电站勘探工作中的最艰巨部分。钻探工人们为了在黄河封冻以前提出筑坝的有关资料，正在采用流水作业法，日日夜夜进行工作。
    三门峡水库一角
    新华社三门峡22日电　在黄河三门峡水库库区的涑水盆地，20日开始为建筑防水坝而进行地质勘探工作。
    涑水在山西省的西南部，是黄河支流之一。涑水下游的涑水盆地有驰名远近的盐池，农产也很丰富。将来当三门峡水库大坝拦洪蓄水达到一定数量的时候，水库里的水要侵入涑水盆地。为了保护这个盆地，要在盆地的西南端建筑一条防水土坝。
    为这条土坝工程搜集设计资料的勘探工作，是由三门峡地质勘探总队的部分人员负担的。他们计划在这里钻二十二个钻孔，钻孔总长一千五百公尺，预计明年1月完成。
