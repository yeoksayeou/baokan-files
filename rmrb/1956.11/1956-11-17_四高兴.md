    "Four Joys"
    "Bumper harvests across the board, increased production in every field" – this is how the members of the Wangjialing Jiyi Agricultural Cooperative in Lu'an County, Shanxi Province, evaluated the cooperative's production achievements in the year since it became an advanced cooperative.

    This year, the total output of grain crops managed by the cooperative reached 240,639 jin, more than double last year's total output.

    When formulating the distribution plan, the members unanimously proposed selling 14,000 jin of surplus grain to the state (the original task was 10,000 jin). In addition, it was decided to set aside 10,000 jin as reserve grain.

    As the total output of the cooperative increased, the income of the members increased, and their lives became better. Wang Haoqiu's family of eight received 11,227 jin of grain, an average of more than 1,400 jin per person. Wang Lai-tong, a "Five Guarantees" household, received 500 jin of rations per person, and the cooperative also gave them 40 yuan in cash. Member Wang Manhui excitedly said: "After setting up the advanced cooperative, there are four joys: first, I am happy that the total output has increased, and every family has a full granary; second, I am happy to support industrialization by selling 4,000 jin more grain; third, I am happy that our lives have greatly improved; fourth, I am happy that we have reserve grain and are not afraid of future disasters!"

    “四高兴”
    “样样丰收、块块增产”，这是山西潞安县王家岭集益农业社社员给该社转高级社一年来的生产成绩作的评价。
    这个社今年经营的粮食作物，总产量达到二十四万零六百三十九斤，超过去年总产量一倍。
    在制定分配方案的时候，社员们一致提议卖给国家一万四千斤余粮（原定任务是一万斤）。此外，还决定留出一万斤储备粮。
    随着全社的增产，社员的收入增多了，生活过的也就更好了，社员王好秋，全家八口人，可分粮一万一千二百二十七斤，每人平均一千四百多斤。“五保”户王来桶，每人除吃到五百斤口粮外，社里还给了四十元现款。社员王满会兴奋地说：“办起高级社后有四高兴：一高兴总产量提高，家家粮满仓；二高兴支援工业化，多卖四千斤粮；三高兴生活大改善；四高兴有了储备粮，不怕今后遭灾荒！”
