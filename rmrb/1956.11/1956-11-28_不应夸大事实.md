    Facts Should Not Be Exaggerated
    The news about the "Cultural Palace Capable of Holding 30,000 People" published on page three of your newspaper on October 23rd, and the news about "Fengfeng Building a Workers' Cultural Palace" published on page two of the Hebei Daily on October 17th, both exaggerated the facts. The truth is this: the Fengfeng Mining Bureau, Basic Construction Bureau, Geological Office, and the Mining Area Trade Union are building a workers' club in a concentrated residential area for employees. After completion, this club will only be able to accommodate 1,200 people for activities at the same time.

    不应夸大事实
    你报在10月23日三版发表的“容纳三万人的文化宫”的消息，和河北日报10月17日二版发表的“峰峰兴建工人文化宫”的消息，都夸大了事实。事实是这样：峰峰矿务局、基本建设局、地质办事处、矿区工会四个单位在职工居住集中的地方兴建一个工人俱乐部，这个俱乐部建成后只能容纳一千二百人同时活动。
