Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 1st: The United Nations Afro-Asian group issued a statement on the evening of October 31st, condemning the aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, and demanding a halt to the bombing of Egypt and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Egyptian territory.

The Afro-Asian group met after the UN Security Council made its decision to convene an emergency special session of the General Assembly. The vast majority of the twenty-three countries in the group attended the meeting and all agreed to the statement issued afterwards.

The statement said: "The member states of the Afro-Asian group note with anger that the land and cities of Egypt have been invaded and bombed by Israeli, British and French forces, causing loss of life and property to the Egyptian people. No member state of the United Nations, not even a permanent member of the Security Council, can act arbitrarily in disregard of the law."

	"The member states of the Afro-Asian group strongly condemn the naked violation of Egyptian sovereignty by Israel, Britain, and France, and the serious damage to the Charter of the United Nations caused by this act."

The statement demanded that the armies of Israel, Britain, and France "immediately stop bombing Egyptian territory and people, immediately withdraw from Egyptian territory, and act in accordance with the moral spirit expressed throughout the world through the United Nations agencies."

The statement added, "The member states of the Afro-Asian group believe that the serious nature of the current crisis does not require doubt, but rather requires continued efforts within the United Nations and trust in the United Nations. The member states of the Afro-Asian group fully agree with the decision of the Security Council to convene an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly on this issue."

The Chairman of the Afro-Asian Group for October, Indonesian representative Sudjarwo, said that the Afro-Asian Group is drafting a motion to be submitted to the emergency special session of the General Assembly.

    联合国亚非集团发表声明
    要求英法以军队撤出埃及
    新华社1日讯　纽约消息：联合国亚非集团10月31日晚上发表声明，谴责英、法和以色列对埃及的侵略，并且要求停止轰炸埃及和撤退埃及境内的所有外国部队。
    亚非集团在联合国安全理事会作出关于召开大会紧急特别会议的决定以后举行了会议。这个集团的二十三个国家中绝大多数国家出席了这次会议，并且都同意会后发表的声明。
    这篇声明说：“亚非集团的成员国以愤怒的心情注意到埃及的国土和城市受到以色列、英国和法国部队的入侵和轰炸，因此而使埃及人的生命财产遭受到损失。联合国的任何会员国，甚至是安全理事会的常任理事国都不可以不顾法律而肆意行动。”
      “亚非集团的成员国强烈地谴责以色列、英国和法国对埃及主权的赤裸裸的侵犯行为，以及这一行为所引起的对联合国宪章的严重破坏。”
    声明要求以色列、英国和法国的军队“立即停止轰炸埃及的领土和人民，立即撤离埃及的国土并且依照全世界通过联合国各机构所表示的道义精神来采取行动。”
    声明又说，“亚非集团的成员国认为，目前危机的严重性质不是要求怀疑，而是要求继续在联合国进行努力和对联合国信任。亚非集团的成员国完全同意安全理事会就这个问题召开一次联合国大会紧急特别会议的决定。”
    亚非集团10月份主席、印度尼西亚代表苏加沃说，亚非集团正在草拟一项提交大会紧急特别会议的动议。
