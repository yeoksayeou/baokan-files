    Rare High Silkworm Cocoon Yield

    (Our dispatch) The unit yield of silkworm cocoons in Shanxi Province has always been low. This year, due to the strengthening of technical guidance and the promotion of improved silkworm varieties, great achievements have been made in silkworm cocoon production, and rare high-yield records have appeared. Qingshui, Yangcheng, Lingchuan, Gaoping, Jincheng and other counties raised a total of 47,873 improved spring silkworm breeds this year, with an average yield of 48 jin and 15 liang per breed, more than twice that of local silkworm breeds, and the total output exceeded the original plan by more than 230,000 jin. The women's silkworm breeding group led by Xue Fengying, a member of the Communist Youth League of the Xinsheng Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qingshui County, achieved unprecedented success in breeding improved silkworm varieties. Four silkworm breeds produced a total of 389 jin of cocoons, with an average yield of 97 jin and 4 liang per breed, greatly exceeding the highest unit yield in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other key silkworm cocoon producing areas in China.

    罕有的高额产茧量
    本报讯　山西省蚕桑单位产量向来不高，今年，由于加强了技术指导和推广了改良蚕种，蚕茧生产获得了很大成绩，并出现了罕有的高产纪录。沁水、阳城、陵川、高平、晋城等县，今年共养改良春蚕四万七千八百七十三张，平均每张产茧四十八斤十五两，超过本地蚕种一倍以上，总产量超过原计划二十三万多斤。沁水县新胜高级农业生产合作社青年团员薛凤英领导的妇女养蚕组养的改良蚕种得到了空前的丰收。有四张蚕种共产茧三百八十九斤，平均每张产茧九十七斤四两，大大地超过了我国重点蚕茧产区江苏、浙江等地的最高单位产量。　（马秀林）
