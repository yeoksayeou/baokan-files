Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 26th: Anshan City is already covered with thick white snow, but in the greenhouses of agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs, which produce vegetables, it is like spring. Green cucumber vines are hanging with three-inch-long small cucumbers, and bright red tomatoes are already ripe.

　　These vegetables are all cultivated using natural sunlight and do not require heating even when the weather is as cold as minus thirty degrees. The cost of vegetables produced in unheated greenhouses is more than half lower than that of artificially heated greenhouses.

　　Anshan farmers have been operating these greenhouses for more than twenty years. In the past two years, with the help of agricultural technicians, farmers have summarized their experience in greenhouse vegetable production and improved the structure of the greenhouses.

　　From the 19th to the 24th, agricultural technicians and representatives of agricultural cooperatives from more than twenty counties and suburbs north of the Yangtze River carefully visited and studied the structure of the greenhouses and the vegetable production process in Anshan, preparing to go back and promote them.

    不加温的温室
    据新华社鞍山26日电　鞍山市已经盖上了厚厚的白雪，但在郊区农业社生产蔬菜的温室里，却像春天一样，绿色的黄瓜藤上挂着三寸多长的小黄瓜，鲜红的西红柿已经成熟了。
    这些蔬菜都是利用天然的阳光培植的，即使在天气冷到零下三十度的情况下，也不用加温。不加温的温室生产的蔬菜，成本比人工加温的温室低一半多。
    鞍山农民经营这种温室已经有二十多年了。近两年来，在农业技术人员的帮助下，农民总结了温室生产蔬菜的经验，并改进了温室的构造。
    19日到24日，来自北京和长江以北的二十多个县城和郊区的农业技术人员和农业社的代表，在鞍山细致地参观和研究了温室的构造和蔬菜生产过程等经验准备回去推广。
