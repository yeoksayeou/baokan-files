    Enamel Mug
    Wan Quan
    Every time I walk into a department store and see those clean white, soft beige, and attractively patterned enamel mugs, I feel a sense of pleasure.
    When I was in middle school, due to a girl's fastidiousness, I liked to use white enamelware. I remember that back then, buying a pure white Swedish-made large mug cost more than five silver dollars and required going to foreign shops like "Hall & Holtz." In Chongqing in 1939, a certain store imported a batch of enamel mugs from the Burma Road, and the price was naturally more expensive than before the war. I scraped together the money and asked a friend to bring one back from the city; my friend was perhaps too nervous, and dropped the mug on the ground as soon as they left the store, chipping off a piece of the enamel.
    Later, I took this scarred mug to the anti-Japanese base area. Its uses unexpectedly increased—drinking water, holding rice, heating dishes, cooking porridge for sick comrades, and when necessary, it could even serve as a "washbasin" or "bathtub." From then on, the mug and I developed a deeper "fighting friendship."
    In 1946, I came to Beiping. I really wanted to buy a new mug to replace the old one that had served me so faithfully. But at that time, it was not easy to buy such things in Beiping. Once, at the Dongdan Xiaoshi market (dear reader, the Dongdan Street Garden and Wangfujing Street roadside were once full of small stalls selling used goods, a market prepared by those forced by food and clothing for those with low purchasing power), I found a pure white Swedish mug at a stall with only a few items for sale. This was exactly what I needed. But the stall owner's asking price exceeded my ability to pay. I hoped she would lower the price, but she burst into tears; it was then that I realized she was a young woman who looked like an intellectual. She explained that she had a sick family member who needed money for medicine, and she was selling things she used at home. I immediately paid the price with all the money I had. She urged me to buy something else, and although I felt heavy-hearted and wanted to help her, I really had no more money. Later, after leaving Beiping, this mug accompanied me through several years of the Liberation War, and it often reminded me vividly of the tearful look in that young woman's eyes—the eyes of the people of Beiping suffering in poverty and civil war.
    In 1949, I entered the city again. My husband bought me a beige mug with all his pocket money as a souvenir of victory. This one was American-made; the department store at the time said, "This beige enamel is only available in American products." Unfortunately, it was no longer so important to me. First, because as I got older, I had lost my obsession with certain small details of life; second, in the peaceful city life, the mug's uses had returned to normal. However, even now when I come across various enamel mugs, I can't help but take a look at them. Because those that are as pure white as Swedish products, and those that are beige "only available in American products," are now all made in China; and the variety of designs and colors is constantly increasing, and the price is much cheaper.
    The housewife who sold her own mug at the Dongdan stall back then must have already purchased a new, domestically made mug. (Attached image)

    搪瓷茶缸
    万全
    每走进百货公司，看到那些洁白的、柔和的米黄色的和花色诱人的搪瓷茶缸，总感到一种愉快。
    上中学的时候，由于少女的洁癖，喜欢使用白色的搪瓷器皿。记得那时候要买一只瑞典货的纯白大茶缸，要花五块多光洋，得进“惠罗公司”之类外国铺子。1939年在重庆，某商店从滇缅路运进来一批搪瓷茶缸，价钱当然比战前更贵。我凑足了钱，托朋友进城捎了一只；我的朋友也许过于紧张，一出商店门就将茶缸掉在地上，摔脱了一块瓷。
    以后，我带着这只有疤痕的茶缸进了抗日根据地。它的用途倒意外地多起来了——喝水、盛饭、热菜，给生病的同志煮粥，必要时还可以代行“面盆”、“浴缸”的职责。从此，茶缸和我有了进一步的“战斗的友情”。
    1946年来到北平。很想买一只新的茶缸，代替那只为我鞠躬尽瘁的旧茶缸。可是当时的北平还不易买到这玩意。有一次，在东单小市上（亲爱的读者，现在的东单街心花园和王府井大街路旁，当年曾满布卖旧货的小摊，那是为衣食所迫的人们替那些购买力低微的人们所准备的市场），在一个只有几件售品的地摊上，我发现了一只纯白的瑞典茶缸。这正是我所需要的。可是地摊女主人的索价超过我的购买力。我希望她降低售价，她竟眼泪盈眶；这时我才发觉她是一个知识分子模样的青年妇女。她解释说家有病人等钱吃药，所卖的是自己家用的东西。我马上尽我所有付了价款。她劝说我再买一件什么，我虽然心情沉重，很想帮她的忙，但也实在没有钱了。以后，离开了北平，这只茶缸又陪伴我经历了解放战争中的几年，而且，它常常使我清晰地回忆起那位青年妇女的含泪的眼神——在穷困与内战中经受着痛苦的北平人民的眼神。
    1949年又进入城市。我的丈夫以他的全部零用钱买了一只米黄色茶缸赠我，作为胜利的纪念。这一只是美国货，当时百货店说：“这种米色搪瓷只有美国货。”可惜，它对于我并不重要了。一来因为年岁增加，已经失去对于某些生活小节的执着；二来和平的城市生活中，茶缸的用途已经回复正常。可是，至今我碰到各种搪瓷茶缸，仍不免要看它们一眼。因为像瑞典货一样纯白的也好，“只有美国货”的米黄色的也好，都已经是我们中国的出品了；而且品种花色常在增加，价钱也便宜得多了。
    当年东单地摊上那位出卖了自用茶缸的主妇，想必早已添置了我国自制的新的茶缸吧。（附图片）
