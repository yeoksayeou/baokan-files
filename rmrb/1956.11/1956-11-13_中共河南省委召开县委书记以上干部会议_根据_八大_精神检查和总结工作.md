Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 9th. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of cadres at the county party secretary level and above from October 20th to November 5th. In accordance with the spirit of the Party's Eighth National Congress, the meeting inspected and summarized work, and exposed and criticized shortcomings and errors such as subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism.

The meeting first studied the various reports and resolutions of the Party's Eighth National Congress, and then reviewed the work of Henan Province. The meeting believed that since the Party's First Henan Provincial Congress, Party organizations at all levels have paid attention to opposing right-leaning conservatism and impetuous adventurism, and the guiding ideology has been relatively clear. At the same time, the revised plan is also more realistic. During this period, the development of all aspects of the province's work has been normal. At the same time, the leadership style of Party committees at all levels has undergone relatively significant changes, and they have begun to pay attention to investigation and research, and to guide work in accordance with local conditions.

The cadres attending the meeting also focused on criticizing the harm caused by subjectivist thinking to practical work. The meeting pointed out that the main reason why impetuous and adventurous tendencies arose after opposing right-leaning conservative ideas in the first half of this year was: because they had no clear understanding of the situation and did not conduct in-depth investigation and research, but acted based on enthusiasm and subjective wishes. In the preparation of agricultural plans, they blindly pursued advanced levels and raised indicators at each level, resulting in indicators that were impossible to achieve among the masses. In the preparation of industrial production and capital construction plans, they also failed to fully consider the connections between all aspects, resulting in plans that changed repeatedly, and some still could not achieve balanced development.

The meeting also focused on examining the specific manifestations of bureaucracy and sectarianism. Due to the large number of institutions and overlapping levels, the phenomenon of "five excesses" (too many offices, meetings, documents, reports, and telephone calls) in the leading organs of various localities was widespread. For example, the Kaifeng Prefectural Commissioner's Office had a total of 28 special offices in addition to its formal establishment; the Kaifeng Prefectural Commissioner concurrently held 14 positions. Many leading cadres were trapped in red tape and routine affairs all day long, unable to go deep among the masses and listen to their opinions. Due to the subjectivism and bureaucracy of the leadership, it also promoted the growth of commandism among lower-level cadres. The meeting criticized the erroneous phenomenon of some agricultural cooperatives arbitrarily punishing members. For example, the Shiqiaolu Township Agricultural Cooperative in Changge County stipulated more than a dozen methods for punishing cooperative members' work points. During the wheat harvest and summer planting alone, 473 members were fined in the 19 production teams of the cooperative.

In order to effectively carry out the struggle against subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism, the meeting decided to organize cadres throughout the province to systematically study the "Eighth National Congress" documents this winter and next spring, and to rectify and improve the ideological style of cadres on the basis of carefully studying the documents and raising ideological awareness. The meeting decided that after this systematic rectification and study, cadre meetings should be held roughly every three to four months to continue to implement the spirit of rectification and to improve the ideological level of cadres by summarizing and reviewing work. In addition, the Spring Festival should be used every year to carry out more systematic rectification to form a system. The meeting required leading organs at all levels to greatly strengthen investigation and research on actual situations. The provincial, prefectural, and municipal party committees should establish special investigation and research institutions, stipulate regular investigation and research systems, and promote a general atmosphere of investigation and research among cadres.

In addition, the meeting also determined that responsible cadres of the provincial, prefectural, and municipal party committees should spend two months each year going to the countryside and factories; responsible cadres of party organizations at the county level and in factories and enterprises should spend four months each year going deep into grassroots organizations to specifically check and help with work. Each member of the provincial, prefectural, and municipal party committees should be assigned to regularly contact a special area, a county, or a commune, a factory or mine, or a trading enterprise in order to connect with reality and connect with the masses.

    中共河南省委召开县委书记以上干部会议
    根据“八大”精神检查和总结工作
    会议确定今后省委、地委、市委的负责干部每年要有两个月的时间下乡下厂，县一级和工厂企业中党组织的负责干部每年要有四个月的时间深入基层工作
    新华社郑州9日电　中共河南省委员会在10月20日到11月5日召开了全省县委书记以上干部会议。会议根据党的全国第八次代表大会精神，检查和总结了工作，揭发和批判了主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义等缺点和错误。
    会议首先学习了党的第八次全国代表大会的各项报告和决议，然后对河南省的工作进行了检查。会议认为：自从党的河南省第一次代表大会以后，党的各级组织注意反对了右倾保守思想和急躁冒进情绪，领导思想比较明确，同时经过修订的计划，也比较切合实际。在这期间，全省各方面工作的发展都是正常的。同时，各级党委的领导作风都有了比较显著的转变，开始注意调查研究，因地制宜地指导工作。
    到会的干部还着重批评了主观主义思想对于实际工作所造成的危害。会议指出，今年上半年在反对了右倾保守思想以后，所以又产生了急躁冒进偏向的主要原因是：由于心中无数，没有深入实际进行调查研究，而是凭热情和主观愿望办事。在编制农业计划中，盲目追求先进，层层提高指标，结果到群众中变成了一个不可能实现的指标。在编制工业生产和基本建设计划时，也因为没有完整地考虑到各方面的联系，结果，计划一变再变，有的仍然不能得到平衡发展。
    会议还集中检查了官僚主义和宗派主义的具体表现。由于机构庞大、层次重叠，各地领导机关的办公室多、会议多、文件多、表报多、电话多的五多现象普遍存在。如开封专署除正式编制外，共有各种专门办公室二十八个；开封专署专员一人兼十四职。不少领导干部终日陷入文牍主义和事务主义，不能深入群众，倾听群众的意见。由于领导上的主观主义和官僚主义，也促使下级干部的命令主义作风在滋长。会议批评了有些农业社任意处罚社员的错误现象。如长葛石桥路乡农业社规定处罚社员工分办法有十几种，仅在麦收夏种中，全社十九个生产队被罚的社员就有四百七十三人。
    为了有效地开展反对主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的斗争，会议确定今冬明春要组织全省干部系统学习“八大”的文件，并在精读文件、提高思想认识的基础上，整顿和提高干部的思想作风。会议决定，各地经过这次系统地整风学习以后，大体上每三四个月要召开一次干部会议，继续贯彻整风精神，通过总结检查工作，以提高干部的思想水平。此外，并要利用每年的春节时间，进行比较系统地整顿，以此形成制度。会议要求各级领导机关都要大大加强对于实际情况的调查研究。省委、地委、市委要建立专门的调查研究机构，规定经常进行调查研究的制度，并在干部中提倡普遍进行调查研究的风气。
    另外，会议还确定省委、地委、市委负责干部每年要有两个月的时间下乡、下厂；县一级和工厂、企业中党组织负责干部每年要有四个月的时间深入基层组织，具体检查帮助工作。省委、地委、市委每个委员都要确定经常联系一个专区、一个县或一个社、一个厂矿或贸易企业，以便联系实际，联系群众。
