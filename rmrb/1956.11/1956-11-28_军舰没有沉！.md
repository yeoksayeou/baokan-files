“The Warship Didn't Sink!”
    Lu Qiming
    The sea and air were filled with dark clouds, the sky was pitch black, and the warship continued its night voyage.

    Except for the watchkeepers, the sailors on the warship had been in bed for over an hour. Suddenly, a level-one combat readiness alarm sounded, and the sailors quickly assembled. The captain issued an order from the bridge:

    "Starboard side, below the waterline, hit by a shell and taking on water, breach is three and a half inches wide and two inches high, quick, take action!"

    At this time, the lights were already dimmed. I stood on the bridge, watching the sailors' agile and skilled movements. In the dark, some went to get fire extinguishers, others to get wooden plugs and water hoses... They were so familiar with their warship and weapons, neither confused nor grabbing the wrong tools. This greatly surprised me, a newcomer to the ship, because I once even fumbled in the wrong direction when trying to find the toilet. In an instant, the sailors rushed to the "breach" to "take action." At this moment, I saw the political commissar come over, and he shouted sternly:

    "The warship is sinking!"

    The sailors looked around, then at the political commissar. One sailor timidly said, "Political Commissar, this is a drill. The warship is sailing fine, how can you say it's sinking?"

    "Everyone, assemble on the aft deck!"

    The sailors stood neatly on the aft deck, listening to the political commissar's speech in silence: "...A sailor asked me, 'Aren't we standing fine on the deck, how can you say the warship has already sunk?' Comrades, our warship is indeed sinking! In the drill just now, the task of Private Zhao Zhiqing was to plug the 'breach' with a wooden plug, and the task of Corporal Zheng Jianguo was to hold the wooden plug in place with an iron bar. However, Zhao Zhiqing only made a show of putting the wooden plug in the hole, and Zheng Jianguo didn't even hold the wooden plug in place before reporting 'rescue completed.' Comrades, the power of water is great, how could this stop the seawater from rushing in!" He paused, looked at everyone, and said, "Drills are not games, they are for combat. Every action must meet combat requirements, so that we can improve our combat skills! Comrades, do you understand?"

    "Understood!" The sailors' loud answer broke through the silent sea and air.

    It was already two o'clock in the morning, and the warship was still sailing. A drill order was suddenly issued from the command platform again. When the sailors quickly rushed to another "breach" to take action, the political commissar stood nearby, observing every sailor's movements with extreme care. The more he watched, the happier he became.

    "Report to the Political Commissar, leak plugged, the warship didn't sink!" Zheng Jianguo walked over and reported to him.

    "I saw it. This drill was very good. Zhao Zhiqing and Zheng Jianguo's actions were very realistic. Comrades, we must train ourselves in this way, so that we can skillfully use the weapons and equipment in our hands in various complex and difficult conditions. Only in this way can we quickly annihilate the enemy in battle!"

    “军舰没有沉！”
    陆其明
    海空乌云密布，天漆黑，军舰继续夜航。
    军舰上除值更人员外，水兵们已经上床睡觉一个多小时了。突然，一级战备的警报响了起来，水兵们很快集合，舰长从驾驶台上下达了一道命令：
    “右舷，水线以下，中弹进水，破损口宽三寸五，高二寸，迅速抢救！”
    这时灯火已被管制了。我站在舰桥上看着水兵们敏捷、熟练的动作：他们在黑夜里，有去拿灭火器的，有去拿木塞、水龙头的……他们对自己的军舰和武器装备是那么熟悉，既不乱也不拿错器具。这一点使我上舰不久的人大为惊奇，因为我有一次连上厕所都摸错了地方。一瞬间，水兵们奔到“破损”的地方“抢救”。这时候，我看见政委也走过来，他严厉地喊了一声：
    “军舰下沉了！”
    水兵们环顾着周围，又望了望政委，有一个水兵胆怯地说：“政委同志，这是操演，军舰不是好好地在航行，怎么说沉了呢？”
    “全体后甲板上集合！”
    水兵们都整齐地站在后甲板上，一声不响地听着政委的讲话：“……有个水兵问我，‘我们不是好好地站在甲板上，怎么说军舰已经沉了呢？’同志们，我们的军舰的的确确是沉了！刚才操演中，上等兵赵志清的任务是用木塞堵住‘破损’的口子，下士郑建国的任务是用铁杆顶住木塞。但是，赵志清的木塞只是在口子上做了一个样子，郑建国的铁杆呢，也没有顶住木塞就报告‘抢救完毕’。同志们，水的力量是很大的，这怎么顶得住海水涌进来呢！”他顿了顿，望望大家，又说：“操演不是游戏，是为了作战，每一个动作都要符合战斗要求，这样才能提高我们的作战本领！同志们，听懂了没有？”
    “懂啦！”水兵们宏亮的回答声，冲破了静寂的海空。
    已经是午夜两点钟了，军舰还在继续航行，指挥台上又突然下达了操演的命令。当水兵们迅速向另一个“破损”处抢救的时候，政委站在附近，他极其细致地观察着每一个水兵的动作，他越看越高兴。
    “报告政委同志，堵漏完毕，军舰没有沉！”郑建国走过来向他报告。
    “我看见了，这次操演得很好，赵志清和郑建国的动作很逼真，同志们，我们就要这样来锻炼自己，使自己能在各种复杂困难条件下，都能熟练地运用自己手中的武器和器械，这样我们才能在战斗中迅速地歼灭敌人！”
