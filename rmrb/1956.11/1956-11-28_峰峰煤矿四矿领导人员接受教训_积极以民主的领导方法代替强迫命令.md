Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 27th—Since June of this year, the leadership cadres at all levels of the state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine's Fourth Mine have changed their coercive and commandist work style, which has strengthened the relationship between cadres and workers, and the workers' production enthusiasm has surged.

In the first half of 1955, the mine failed to meet the state plan for several consecutive months, workers' labor discipline was lax, and the management system was also chaotic. The leadership believed that simply relying on criticism and persuasion could not solve the problem, so they formulated more than a dozen systems for deducting workers' wages. As a result, the production enthusiasm of the workers was seriously harmed, production remained in an abnormal state, and it fostered bureaucracy and a coercive style of leadership.

In order to change this situation, with the specific help of the Fengfeng Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the leading cadres conducted inspections from top to bottom. The Secretary of the General Party Branch of the mine and the mine director publicly reviewed their past mistakes to all employees, and all the deducted wages were returned to the workers. In addition, a solicitation of opinions committee was jointly established by the Party organization, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League. Based on the criticisms and suggestions made by the employees, a series of specific measures and methods were developed to improve the leadership style. As a result, the democratic spirit within the enterprise was promoted, and the workers' enthusiasm for production grew higher and higher.

Now, the vast majority of cadres in the mine have changed their original rigid attitude and are paying attention to cherishing the slightest progress of the workers. Recently, a deputy mine director went down the mine and saw two workers preparing to cut a long prop timber into short prop timbers for use. He explained the importance of saving wood to the workers, and then together with the workers, he found short prop timbers to replace them. At that time, the two workers were very moved and said that they would never use large materials for small purposes again. The leading cadres and relevant functional department personnel of this mine spend about half of their time each week going down the mine, to the workers' dormitories, wards, and canteens to understand the difficulties and problems of the workers in production, thought, and life. Many long-standing problems have been solved. Since November, the mine has also changed its past practice of having only a few leading cadres compile monthly plans and forcing employees to implement them. Now, after the leadership puts forward preliminary economic indicators, they are handed over to the workers for discussion. The workers said: "In the past, the plan controlled people, but now people control the plan. We must find a way to complete the plan we have made ourselves."

    峰峰煤矿四矿领导人员接受教训
    积极以民主的领导方法代替强迫命令
    新华社保定27日电　国营峰峰煤矿四矿各级领导干部从今年6月以来改变了强迫命令和惩办主义的作风以后，密切了干部和工人之间的关系，工人生产热情高涨。
    1955年上半年，这个矿连续几个月完不成国家计划，工人劳动纪律松弛，管理制度也很混乱。领导方面认为，要扭转这种局面单靠批评、说服教育不能解决问题，因此制定了十几种扣罚工人工资的制度。执行的结果，严重地伤害了工人的生产积极性，生产仍是处于不正常状态，而且助长了领导上的官僚主义和强迫命令作风。
    为了改变这种状况，这个矿在中共峰峰市委的具体帮助下，领导干部由上而下地进行了检查，矿的中共党总支书记、矿长公开向全体职工检讨了过去的错误，扣罚工人的工资全部退还。另外，还由中共党组织、行政、工会、青年团共同成立了征求意见委员会，根据职工提出的批评和建议，作出一系列改进领导作风的具体措施和办法。因此，企业内的民主精神得到发扬，工人的生产劲头越来越高。
    现在，这个矿绝大多数的干部都改变了原来生硬的态度，注意爱护工人的点滴进步。最近，有一次一位副矿长下矿井看到两个工人正在准备把一根长坑木截成短坑木使用，他向工人说明了节约木材的重要意义，然后又同工人一起去找到了短坑木来代替。当时这两个工人很受感动，表示以后再也不大材小用了。这个矿的领导干部和有关职能科室人员，每周有一半左右的时间到井下、职工宿舍、病房、食堂去了解职工生产、思想、生活的困难和问题，许多过去长期存在的问题都得到了解决。11月份以来，这个矿还改变了以往只是少数领导干部编制月计划，硬要职工贯彻的作法。现在领导方面提出初步经济指标以后，就交给工人群众讨论，工人们说：“过去是计划制人，现在是人制计划，我们自己制定的计划，就得一定想办法完成它。”
