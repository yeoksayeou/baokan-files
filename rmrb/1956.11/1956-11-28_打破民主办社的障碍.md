    Break Down Obstacles to Democratic Cooperative Management
    Currently, democratic life is abnormal in many agricultural production cooperatives. The coercive and commanding style of some grassroots cadres has seen new developments. Many important issues concerning the entire cooperative, which should originally be discussed and approved by all members, are often decided arbitrarily by a few leading cadres, who then force the members to implement them. Some issues, although discussed by the members, are merely to complete the formality of approval, and are actually decided by the cadres. The phenomenon of arbitrarily deducting work points from members who have opinions, and arbitrarily stopping members from working, also occurs frequently in some places. In this situation, how can members "love the cooperative as their home" and fully unleash their enthusiasm for production?
    After the basic realization of agricultural collectivization, the vast majority of manpower, materials, and finances in rural areas are concentrated in agricultural production cooperatives. An agricultural production cooperative often includes thousands of households of farmers, controlling the livelihoods of these thousands of households. This concentration in economy and leadership overcomes all the weaknesses of the small-peasant economy, facilitates the adoption of new production-increasing measures, focuses the main strength on key links for increasing production, and better fulfills the state's agricultural production increase plans and improves the lives of farmers. However, this concentration in economy and leadership also generates new contradictions. On the one hand, in order to facilitate production leadership, cooperatives must establish relatively complete organizational structures. Thus, from the management committee to the production team, and from the production team to the production group, the leadership layers have increased. The "individual networking" and "door-to-door" working methods that were often used by the main grassroots cadres in rural areas when leading production and implementing policies are easily abandoned. In this situation, bureaucracy and administrative order style easily grow. On the other hand, because members completely rely on the cooperative for their family's livelihood, they often care about their income and other specific interests; the leading cadres of the cooperative, however, often focus more on the overall situation of the cooperative and often do not consider or take care of the individual interests of the members adequately. The most fundamental way to resolve these contradictions is to implement the policy of democratic cooperative management, allowing the vast majority of members to truly be masters of their own affairs in the cooperative; adhere to the mass line working method of "consulting with the masses on everything," and always pay attention to overcoming bureaucracy and coercive command style. Only in this way can the sense of ownership and production enthusiasm of the members be fully mobilized and the cooperative be well-managed.
    However, the policy of democratic cooperative management will inevitably encounter many obstacles in its implementation. We must break down these obstacles.
    Some people believe that after farmers join fully socialist cooperatives, they only care about labor work points and not about the collective interests of the cooperative. Therefore, it is enough to give them work to do; as for being masters of their own affairs, that is the cadres' business. It is true that members do care about labor work points. The lives of their entire family, old and young, depend on these work points, so how can they not care? However, it is wrong to oppose the members' concern for labor work points to their concern for collective interests, and to think that members only care about work points and not about collective interests. In fact, most members already understand that the amount of work points each person receives, and the value of each work point, entirely depends on the good or bad operation and management of the agricultural cooperative. If the cooperative reduces production, what is the use of getting more work points? Some members seem to not care much about collective interests for the moment precisely because the cooperative cadres have not respected their right to be masters of their own affairs, and have not done a good job of enlightening and helping them to participate in cooperative management. If the cooperative cadres truly respect the rights of each member, the vast majority of members will certainly show great concern for the collective interests of the entire cooperative.
    Some people believe that now the cooperative is large and there are many people, and "a hundred people have a hundred minds," so it is impossible to obtain the consent of all members to do things. Therefore, they regard "consulting with the masses on everything" as asking for trouble, and regard holding meetings to discuss issues as "going through the motions." This view is also wrong. Of course, the awareness of the members varies, the experience of the members varies, the opinions of the members are sometimes correct and sometimes wrong, and the demands of the members are sometimes appropriate and sometimes excessive. Their views on certain important issues may not be completely consistent at the beginning. However, precisely because the affairs of the cooperative are very complex, grassroots cadres must not deal with various issues simply. They should collect various different opinions, consider and discuss them repeatedly, and then patiently consult with the masses in order to reach a consistent conclusion. Only in this way can incorrect opinions be corrected and inconsistent opinions converge. It should be believed that although the members' views on certain things are different, everyone's fundamental purpose in running the cooperative is the same, and everyone hopes to increase production and increase income. There are no insurmountable contradictions between members and members, and between members and the collective. Being afraid of members' inconsistent opinions and not daring to solve certain divergent opinions can only show that certain cooperative cadres lack the patience to do mass work.
    Some people also think this way: "My coercive command is for the collective interest, for the benefit of all members," and "Although mistakes have occurred, they are excusable." This year, some places promoted advanced production technologies, and although they did not obtain the consent of the masses, the result was actually increased production due to various factors, so this argument became even louder. We should clarify one question: when the masses do have conservative ideas, what should the leaders do? Should they force their way through stubbornly? Or should they repeatedly conduct persuasion and education, and patiently wait for the masses to become aware? When Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a report on the revision of the Party Constitution on behalf of the Party Central Committee, he said: "The more the people's awareness, enthusiasm, and creativity develop, the more the cause of the working class develops." And coercive command, blind recklessness are the most ferocious enemies of the masses' awareness, enthusiasm, and creativity, it can ruin our cause, and should never be excused for any reason.
    The reason why many grassroots cadres have a coercive command style is closely related to the subjective plans, targets, and mandatory decisions of the superiors. Sometimes, coercive command arises precisely from this. Many people with a coercive command style do not know that coercive command is wrong, but they believe that "listening to the opinions of the masses makes it difficult to complete the tasks assigned by the superiors." Some even say: "When we have meetings in the county and district, if our own ideas are not clear, the superiors force us to clear them. In the end, if they are not clear, we still have to accept the task, otherwise we will have to examine our conservative thinking. When we return to the cooperative, we can only use this method to delegate downwards." During the upsurge of cooperativization, many comrades leading rural work only saw the smooth side of the work, ignored the difficult side, were blindly optimistic, and impatient, no longer conducted detailed investigations and research, did not patiently listen to the opinions of the cadres and masses below, formulated plans based on subjective wishes, and forced the lower levels to implement them. Although some grassroots cadres knew that there were difficulties in completing the task, they forced the masses to implement it because they were afraid of being criticized for "not obeying the state plan." In order to implement the policy of democratic cooperative management, the superior leading organs must also change their subjective and bureaucratic thinking style, improve their leadership methods, so that agricultural production cooperatives can both accept the guidance of the state plan and maintain considerable management independence.

    打破民主办社的障碍
    现在有不少农业生产合作社里的民主生活是不正常的。有些基层干部的强迫命令作风有了新的发展。许多关系全社的重大问题，本来应该由全体社员讨论通过，却往往由少数领导干部自作主张，强制社员执行。有些问题虽然经过了社员的讨论，但这种讨论只是为了完成通过的手续，实际上还是干部决定的。对有意见的社员乱扣工分、随便停止社员劳动的现象，在一些地方也时常发生。在这种情况下，怎么能使社员“爱社如家”，充分发挥社员的生产积极性呢？
    在基本实现农业合作化以后，农村中绝大部分人力、物力、财力都集中到农业生产合作社中。一个农业生产合作社往往包括千百户农民，掌握着千百户农民的生计。这种经济上和领导上的集中，克服了小农经济的一切弱点，便于采取新的增产措施，把主要力量用于主要增产环节上，更好地完成国家的农业增产计划和改善农民生活。但是，这种经济上和领导上的集中，也产生了新的矛盾。一方面，合作社为了便于领导生产，必须设置比较完备的组织机构。于是，从管理委员会到生产队，从生产队到生产组，领导层次多起来了。过去农村的主要基层干部领导生产、执行政策的时候常常采用的“个别串连”、“送上门去”的工作方法，就容易被放弃了。在这种情况下，官僚主义和行政命令作风很容易滋长起来。另一方面，由于社员把一家的生计完全寄托于合作社，他们经常关心自己的收入和其他具体利益；合作社的领导干部，却常常较多地从合作社的全面着眼，而对社员的个人利益常常考虑不周，照顾不够。要解决这些矛盾，最根本的办法，是贯彻民主办社的方针，让广大社员真正在合作社里当家作主；坚持“有事和群众商量”的群众路线的工作方法，随时随地注意克服官僚主义和强迫命令作风。只有这样，才能把社员群众的主人翁感觉和生产积极性充分发动起来，把合作社办好。
    但是，民主办社的方针在执行中不可避免地会遇到许多障碍。对于这些障碍，我们必须予以打破。
    有些人认为农民加入完全社会主义性质的合作社以后，他们仅仅关心劳动工分，而不关心合作社的集体利益。因此，只要给他们活干就行了；至于当家作主，那是干部的事。不错，社员确实关心劳动工分。他们全家老少的生活，都是依靠这些工分，他们怎么能不关心呢？但是，把社员关心劳动工分和关心集体利益对立起来，认为社员只关心工分而不关心集体利益，这是错误的。其实，大多数社员已经懂得，每个人得到的工分的多少，每个工分的报酬的大小，完全取决于农业社经营管理的好坏。如果合作社减产了，多得一些工分又有什么用呢？有些社员一时显得不大关心集体利益，正是由于社干部没有尊重他们当家作主的权利，没有很好地启发和帮助他们参加社务管理。如果社干部真正尊重每个社员的权利，广大社员就一定会表现出对于全社的集体利益的巨大关心。
    有些人认为现在社大人多，人多嘴多，“百姓百条心”，办事情要取得全体社员同意是不可能的。因此，他们把“有事要和群众商量”看成是自找麻烦，把开会讨论问题当作是“走走形式”。这种看法同样是错误的。当然，社员的觉悟有高有低，社员的经验有多有少，社员的意见有的正确有的错误，社员的要求有的恰当有的过高。他们对于某些重大问题的看法，在开始的时候也不可能完全一致。但是，正因为合作社里的事情非常复杂，基层干部处理各种问题就更加不能简单从事。他们应该把各种不同的意见搜集起来，加以反复的考虑和讨论，再同群众耐心地商量，以便得出一致的结论。只有这样，不正确的意见才能得到修正，不一致的意见才会趋于一致。应该相信，社员对某些事情的看法尽管不同，大家对于办社的根本目的总是一致的，大家都是希望增加生产、增加收入的。社员和社员、社员和集体之间并没有什么不可克服的矛盾。害怕社员意见不一致而不敢着手解决某些分歧的意见，这只能说明某些社干部缺乏做群众工作的耐心罢了。
    有的人还这样想：“我强迫命令是为了集体利益，为了社员大家”，“虽然发生了错误，却是情有可原的”。今年有的地方推广先进生产技术，虽然没有取得群众的同意，但是因为有多种因素的影响，结果竟然增产了，于是这种论调就更响起来了。我们应该弄清楚一个问题：当群众确有保守思想的时候，领导者应该怎么办？是硬着头皮蛮干呢？还是反复地进行说服教育，耐心地等待群众觉悟呢？邓小平同志代表党中央作修改党章报告的时候说：“人民群众的觉悟性、积极性、创造性愈是发展，工人阶级的事业就愈是发展”。而强迫命令、盲目蛮干却是群众的觉悟性、积极性、创造性的最凶恶的敌人，它能断送我们的事业，绝不要以任何借口加以原谅。
    许多基层干部所以发生强迫命令作风，和上级的主观主义的计划、指标和强制性的决定很有关系。有时候，强迫命令正是从这里产生的。许多有强迫命令作风的人，并非不知道强迫命令是错误的，但是，他们认为“听从群众的意见，就难完成上级分配的任务。”有的还说：“我们在县、区开会，自己思想不通，上级硬给打通，最后如果不通，也得把任务接受下来，不然就得检查保守思想。回到社里，只好用这种办法向下派。”在合作化高潮中，有不少领导农村工作的同志，只看到工作中顺利的一面，忽视了困难的一面，盲目乐观，急躁冒进，不再进行细致的调查研究，不耐心听取下面干部和群众的意见，凭主观愿望订出计划，硬要下面执行。某些基层干部虽然知道完成任务有困难，但是因为害怕受到“不服从国家计划”的批评，也就强迫群众执行。为了贯彻民主办社的方针，上级领导机关也要改变主观主义、官僚主义的思想作风，改善领导方法，使农业生产合作社既接受国家的计划指导，又能保持相当的经营独立性。
