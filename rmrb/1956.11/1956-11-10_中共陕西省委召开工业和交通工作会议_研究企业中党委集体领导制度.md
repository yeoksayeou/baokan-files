    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Electric Dispatch The CCP Shaanxi Provincial Committee recently convened a provincial industrial and transportation work conference to discuss the issue of the Party's leadership system within enterprises.

    The meeting reviewed how, over the past few years, the implementation or preparation for the implementation of the "one-chief system" in industrial and transportation enterprises across the province has generally weakened the Party's leadership role in enterprises. The Party organizations in some enterprises have become subordinate to the administration; some issues involving policy and direction were not submitted to the Party committee for discussion but were decided solely by the administrative负责人 [fù zé rén - person in charge/principal]. In some cases, even when the Party committee discussed and made decisions, the administrative负责人 [fù zé rén - person in charge/principal] did not resolutely implement them. At the same time, bureaucracy, commandism, and complacency grew within the enterprises, and instances of disunity among cadres increased. After fully promoting democracy and criticizing the "one-chief system," the participants in the meeting unanimously supported the establishment of a leadership system centered on the Party committee, combining collective leadership and individual responsibility within the enterprise. Implementing the Party committee leadership system is to implement the Party's collective leadership system and strengthen the Party's actual leadership over enterprises to better run the enterprises, and it does not reduce the responsibility of administrative leadership.

    In addition to unifying understanding ideologically, the meeting also proposed, based on the provisions of the new Party Constitution, that Party organizations at the grassroots level that should be established must be established quickly; those that have already been established but whose organization is not sound enough should be improved. Based on the principle that Party cadres are equivalent to administrative cadres, the responsible cadres of Party organizations at all levels in enterprises must be appropriately adjusted in some cases. Adjustments should be made in a planned manner, preventing rashness. When discussing production plans and other related issues, enterprise Party organizations may invite non-Party engineering and technical cadres to attend meetings and listen to their opinions.

    Fang Zhongru, Secretary of the CCP Shaanxi Provincial Committee, said in his concluding remarks: When implementing the resolutions of the meeting, all units should combine this with the provincial committee's unified plan to study the "Eighth National Congress" documents, and while launching a campaign against subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism, discuss the issue of establishing the Party's leadership system in enterprises. The Provincial Committee will organize a working group to go to enterprises to check on the implementation of the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress" and the resolutions of this meeting.

    More than 700 people attended the meeting, including Party committee secretaries, Party member factory directors or managers from various factories, mines, and other enterprises in Shaanxi Province.

    中共陕西省委召开工业和交通工作会议
    研究企业中党委集体领导制度
    新华社西安电　中共陕西省委最近召开全省工业和交通工作会议，讨论企业内党的领导制度的问题。
    会议回顾过去几年来，在全省工业和交通企业中，由于实行了或者准备实行“一长制”，使党对企业的领导作用普遍降低了。有些企业的党组织变成了行政的附属机构，有些带有方针政策性的问题，不提交党委讨论，而由行政负责人单独决定；有的虽经党委讨论决定，但行政负责人也不坚决执行。同时，企业内部滋长了官僚主义、命令主义和骄傲自满情绪，干部间不团结的现象也增多起来。参加会议的人在充分发扬民主，批判了“一长制”以后，一致拥护应在企业内部建立以党委为核心的、集体领导和个人负责相结合的领导制度。实行党委领导制度，是为了贯彻党的集体领导制度和加强党对企业的实际领导，以便把企业办得更好，而并不是减轻了行政领导的责任。
    会议除了在思想上统一认识以外，又根据新党章的规定，提出凡是应该建立党的基层委员会的单位，必须迅速建立起来；凡是已经建立的单位，但组织还不够健全的应把它健全起来。根据党委干部相当于行政干部的原则，企业中各级党组织的负责干部，有的必须作适当调整。调整时要有计划地进行，防止草率从事。企业党组织在讨论生产计划和其他有关问题的时候，可以吸收非党的工程技术干部列席会议，倾听他们的意见。
    中共陕西省委员会书记方仲如在做会议总结时说：各单位在执行会议决议时，应该结合省委统一布置的学习“八大”文件的规定，在展开反对主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义的同时，讨论建立企业中党的领导制度的问题。省委将组织一个工作组，到企业去检查贯彻“八大”精神和这次会议决议的情况。
    参加这次会议的有陕西省各工厂、矿山和其它企业的党委书记、党员厂长或经理等七百多人。
