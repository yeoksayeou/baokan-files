Xinhua News Agency, November 6th: Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a report today at the National Congress of Active Elements of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Dependents, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers in Socialist Construction.

In his report, Gan Siqi said that you have made outstanding contributions to the people in our country's great people's democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction. You are the closest relatives and comrades-in-arms of our comrades in the army, and we feel very honored by your achievements. Here, with boundless excitement, I extend my cordial respect to you and, through you, to the comrades of the families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers.

In his report, Gan Siqi talked about the contributions made by families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers in various parts of the country to the socialist construction of the motherland. He said: "In the countryside, in industrial and mining enterprises, and in state organs, tens of thousands of you have become respected labor heroes, advanced producers, or model workers, have been elected as people's representatives, cooperative cadres, or have become cadres in industrial and mining enterprises and state organs. For example, among the 7,962 demobilized soldiers working at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, 3,766 have been trained as technicians or cadres at the section-chief level or above, and 201 of them have been elected as advanced producers. Gan Siqi said that these are only some of the more prominent examples. It can be said that among the families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers across the country, there are countless outstanding talents. This is what all the comrades of our People's Liberation Army are most delighted about."

Gan Siqi concluded by saying: "You are people who have a particularly close relationship with the Party and the revolution. I believe you will firmly remember the glorious responsibility on your shoulders. In order to better fulfill your tasks, our comrades in the army hope that you will always maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition in the cause of socialist construction, and earnestly hope that you, together with millions of families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, and together with the people of the whole country, will strive to build our great motherland into a strong socialist industrial country."

In the afternoon, the active elements attending the meeting held group discussions on the report made by Xie Juezai at yesterday's meeting and Gan Siqi's report today.

    在全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人积极分子大会上
    甘泗淇鼓励大家继续为社会主义建设奋斗
    新华社6日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部副主任甘泗淇今天在全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会上作了报告。
    甘泗淇在报告中说，你们在我国伟大的人民民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，为人民立下了卓著的功勋。你们是我们部队同志最亲密的亲人和战友，你们的功绩使我们感到十分光荣。我在这里以无限兴奋的心情，向你们，并通过你们向烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人同志们，表示亲切的敬意。
    甘泗琪在报告中谈到了各地烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人在祖国社会主义建设中所作出的贡献。他说：“在农村中、在工矿企业和国家机关中，你们当中成千成万的人成了受人尊敬的劳动英雄、先进生产者或模范工作者，被选为人民代表，合作社干部，或做了工矿企业和国家机关的干部。例如，参加鞍山钢铁公司工作的七千九百六十二名复员军人中被培养成为技术工人、股长以上的干部的就有三千七百六十六人，其中有二百○一人当选为先进生产者。甘泗淇说，这仅是部分较显著的例子，可以说，在我们全国的烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人中还不知道有多少数不尽的优秀人材。这是我们人民解放军的全体同志们最感到欢欣鼓舞的。
    甘泗淇最后说：“你们是与党和革命的关系特别密切的人，相信你们一定牢牢记住自己肩膀上的光荣的责任。为了更好地履行自己的任务，我们部队同志希望你们在社会主义建设事业中永远保持和发扬光荣传统，并热望你们和千百万烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人一道，和全国人民一道，为把我们伟大的祖国建设成为一个强大的社会主义的工业国而奋斗。
    下午，到会的积极分子分组讨论了谢觉哉在昨天会上作的报告和今天甘泗淇的报告。
