Xinhua News Agency, London, November 14th: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Johnson, issued a statement to the press on the 12th, refuting the comparison between the military aggression against Egypt and the situation in Hungary. He pointed out that Soviet troops acted at the invitation of the Hungarian government, "while we (Britain) were not invited to Egypt."

The 83-year-old Archbishop also said that the Soviet action was "to prevent (Hungary) from returning to the era of fascism," while Britain's action against Egypt was "an attempt (to make Egypt) return to the era of imperialism and colonialism."

    约翰逊说埃、匈局势不能并论
    新华社14日讯　伦敦消息：英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊12日向报界发表一项声明，驳斥把对埃及的军事侵略和匈牙利局势相提并论的说法。他指出，苏联军队是接受匈牙利政府的邀请而行动的，“而我们（英国）则没有被邀请去埃及。”
    这位八十三岁的老教长还说：苏联的行动是“为了防止（匈牙利）退回到法西斯主义时代去”，而英国对埃及的行动却是“企图（使埃及）退回到帝国主义和殖民主义时代去”。
