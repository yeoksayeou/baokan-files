Xinhua News Agency, New York, 8th: The United Nations General Assembly's emergency meeting on the afternoon of November 7th passed the Asian-African countries' proposal demanding the withdrawal of the Anglo-French-Israeli aggressor troops from Egypt, and the proposal from Argentina and other countries regarding the organization of an emergency force.

    Before the vote, the General Assembly discussed these two proposals.

    Nepalese representative Shah said, "The aggressor nations have presented the General Assembly with a fait accompli. It seems that the responsible countries, once they gain a foothold in Egypt, do not want to withdraw." He said that the demand for withdrawal has "no exceptions."

    Iraqi representative Janabi said, "Israel's actions and the actions of Britain and France are colluding. Their meeting point is the Suez Canal."

    Polish representative Birecki proposed an amendment to the six-nation proposal to establish a United Nations International Emergency Force, advocating for the inclusion of Czechoslovakia in the advisory committee. He said that the composition of the committee members should be allocated in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter. The committee should not be influenced by political bias.

    Yugoslav representative Brilej pointed out that a ceasefire alone is not enough; after the ceasefire, all landed troops must withdraw. He said that the Asian-African group's proposal will achieve this goal. The six-nation proposal is a "natural consequence" of the earlier decision regarding the International Emergency Force. He supported Poland's suggestion to allow Czechoslovakia to participate in the advisory committee of this force.

    The Burmese representative supported the Asian-African proposal and the six-nation draft, saying that this is because he believes that "peace is impossible while hostile forces are occupying Egypt."

    British representative Dixon supported the six-nation proposal, but he opposed the Asian-African countries' proposal because it called for the immediate withdrawal of British and French troops. Dixon tried every possible means to find excuses for the continued presence of the British and French aggressor troops on Egyptian territory, thereby exposing their ambition to retake the canal.

    French representative de Guiringaud also expressed disagreement with the Asian-African countries' proposal. He said that France's withdrawal of troops would depend on the "speed of the formation of the United Nations force." He also said that "a vacuum must not be left between the Egyptian and Israeli forces."

    Indian representative Menon said that the United Nations General Assembly must "pay great attention" to the issue of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Egypt. Israel must withdraw from Egypt.

    He said that India would participate in the International Emergency Force if this force was established on the premise of the immediate withdrawal of all troops to the ceasefire line. He emphasized that India believes that this plan means that this force "has no possibility of an occupying mission infringing on Egyptian sovereignty in this region, but only freedom of activity in this region."

    The Libyan representative requested that priority be given to the issue of withdrawing all troops from Egypt. Ceylonese representative Goonewardene said that the Asian-African countries' demand for "immediate" withdrawal of troops from Egypt means "without delay and swiftly." After some other representatives spoke, the meeting began voting.

    The first vote was on Poland's amendment to the six-nation proposal—adding Czechoslovakia to the United Nations Force Advisory Committee—which was rejected by a vote of twenty-three in favor, thirty-one against, and fourteen abstentions.

    The second vote unanimously passed Denmark's proposed amendment to the wording of the six-nation proposal.

    The General Assembly then agreed, without holding a formal vote, to have Ceylon replace Iran on the advisory committee. No one objected.

    After voting separately on several paragraphs of the six-nation proposal, the General Assembly passed the full text of the proposal by an overwhelming majority.

    The General Assembly then also passed the Asian-African countries' proposal.

    Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov, in explaining the Soviet Union's reason for abstaining from voting on the six-nation proposal, accused the plan to send United Nations forces to the Middle East as illegal because it undermined the Security Council's sole authority in this regard. He said, "One cannot ignore the fact that only after the Egyptian people suffered heavy losses, civilians were massacred, and the aggressors seized large tracts of land and practically achieved the goals they put forward in their first ultimatum to Egypt, did the aggressors agree to end the war... Now there are some new circumstances indicating that they are attempting to entrench themselves in the Suez region for a long time and control this region."

    Kuznetsov accused that the proposal to leave British and French technicians in the region to clear the obstacles in the canal showed that Britain and France were willing to stay their troops there for as long as they wanted.

    Kuznetsov insisted that the immediate withdrawal of all aggressor troops would create the necessary conditions for the restoration of peace in the region, and he suggested setting a clear time limit for the withdrawal of these troops.

    He pointed out that the plan for the United Nations International Emergency Force to accept control from the British and French forces is an open attempt to obtain a decision on the Suez Canal issue that caters to Britain and France. The Soviet representative believes it is necessary to point out that the establishment of the International Emergency Force is a violation of the United Nations Charter.

    He said, it is clear that this motion is by no means intended to use international armed forces to stop the aggression against Egypt, but to hand over a large area of ​​Egyptian territory to them. Does the occupation by international forces mean the Egyptian government giving up control? he asked. But considering that the aggressors have been forced to agree to the entry of the international forces, the Soviet delegation abstained from voting.

    Kuznetsov concluded by saying: The Soviet Union is ready to make its own contribution to the rapid cessation of aggression and the promotion of a solution to the Suez Canal issue.

### 苏代表指出建立紧急部队违反宪章  建议联合国明确规定英法以侵略军撤退期限

    苏代表指出建立紧急部队违反宪章
    建议联合国明确规定英法以侵略军撤退期限
    据新华社8日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会11月7日下午的紧急会议通过了亚非国家要求英、法、以三国侵略部队撤出埃及的提案和阿根廷等国家关于组织紧急部队的提案。
    在表决以前，大会就这两个提案进行讨论。
    尼泊尔代表沙阿说，“侵略国家已经使大会面对一个既成事实。应该负责任的国家在埃及一旦得到一个立足点，看来就不想撤退了。”他说，对于撤退的要求来说是“没有例外”的。
    伊拉克代表贾纳德说，“以色列的行动和英法两国的行动是勾通的。它们的会师地点是苏伊士运河。”
    波兰代表比列茨基对建立联合国国际紧急部队的六国提案提出一个修正案，主张把捷克斯洛伐克包括在咨询委员会内。他说，委员会的委员的组成应该按照联合国宪章的精神来分配。委员会不应该受到政治偏见的影响。
    南斯拉夫代表布里列伊指出，单单停火是不够的，停火以后必须撤退所有登陆的部队。他说，亚非集团的提案将达到这个目的。而六国提案是关于国际紧急部队的前些时候的决定的“自然的结果”。他支持波兰主张让捷克斯洛伐克参加这支部队的咨询委员会的建议。
    缅甸代表支持亚非提案和六国草案，他说，这是因为他相信，“在敌对部队占领着埃及的时候，和平是不可能实现的。”
    英国代表狄克逊支持六国提案，但是他反对亚非国家的提案，因为它提出要英法部队立即撤退。狄克逊千方百计地为英、法两国的侵略军队继续留驻在埃及领土上寻找借口，从而暴露了它们重新夺取运河的野心。
    法国代表德居兰加也表示不同意亚非国家的提案。他说，法国撤出部队要看“联合国部队组成的迅速程度”而定。他还说什么“决不能在埃及和以色列部队之间留下真空地带。”
    印度代表梅农说：联合国大会必须“非常重视”以色列军队撤出埃及的问题。以色列必须撤出埃及。
    他说，印度将参加国际紧急部队，假如这个部队是在一切部队立即撤退到停战线以后的前提下建立的话。他强调说，印度认为这个计划意味着这支部队“在这个地区没有可能侵犯埃及主权的占领任务而只有在这个地区活动的自由”。
    利比亚代表要求优先处理使一切军队都撤出埃及的问题。锡兰代表古纳瓦地尼说，亚非国家要求“立即”从埃及撤退军队，这是意味着“毫不迟延和迅速”。在其他一些代表发言以后，会议开始表决。
    第一次就波兰对六国提案的修正案——在联合国部队咨询委员会中增加捷克斯洛伐克——进行表决，结果以二十三票赞成，三十一票反对和十四票弃权被否决。
    第二次表决一致通过了丹麦提出关于六国提案措辞方面的修改。
    大会接着没有举行正式表决就同意由锡兰来代替伊朗参加咨询委员会。没有人表示反对。
    大会在分别表决六国提案的几段以后，以绝大多数票通过了这个提案的全文。
    大会接着还通过了亚非国家的提案。
    苏联外交部副部长库兹涅佐夫在解释苏联在表决六国提案中弃权的原因的时候，指责派遣联合国部队去中东的计划是非法的，因为它破坏了安全理事会在这方面的唯一的职权。他说，“人们不能不置一词地忽视这样的事实，那就是仅仅在埃及人民遭到严重损失，平民惨遭杀害以及在侵略者夺取大片土地和实际上达到了他们在第一个给埃及的最后通牒中提出的目的以后，侵略者才同意结束战争……现在还有一些新的情况表明，他们企图在苏伊士地区长期盘踞下来并且控制这个地区。”
    库兹涅佐夫指责说，要把英、法两国技术人员留在那个地区去清除运河的障碍物的主张表明，英法两国愿意把它们的部队留在那里多久就留多久。
    库兹涅佐夫坚持说，所有侵略军队的立即撤退将为这个地区的恢复和平创造必要的条件，他建议为撤退这些军队订出明确的时间限制。
    他指出，规定从英法部队手中接受控制权的联合国国际紧急部队计划是公开企图得到一个在苏伊士运河问题上迎合英国和法国的决定。苏联代表认为必须指出，国际紧急部队的建立是违反联合国宪章的。
    他说，很明白，这个议案绝不是打算利用国际武装部队去实施关于制止对埃及的侵略，而是要把一大片埃及领土交给它们。国际部队的占领就意味着埃及政府的放弃控制权，这难道还不明显吗？他说，但是考虑到受侵略者已经被迫同意国际部队的进入，苏联代表团在投票时弃了权。
    库兹涅佐夫最后说：苏联对于迅速制止侵略和促成苏伊士运河问题的解决，准备作出自己的贡献。
