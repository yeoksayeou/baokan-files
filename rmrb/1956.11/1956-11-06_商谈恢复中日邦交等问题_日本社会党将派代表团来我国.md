Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from Tokyo: Japan Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo said on the 4th in Hofu City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, that in order to negotiate with China on the issue of restoring diplomatic relations and other important issues between the two countries, the Socialist Party has decided to send a formal delegation to China around January 20th of next year.

Suzuki said that he did not think the Taiwan issue would become a major obstacle to the normalization of relations between China and Japan. He pointed out that China itself will solve the Taiwan issue because it is its internal affair.

Suzuki said that the Socialist Party delegation to be sent to China will not be an ordinary goodwill delegation or an observation delegation. It will consult with the Chinese side on methods for restoring diplomatic relations between China and Japan, specific methods for promoting cooperation between the Japan Socialist Party's five-year economic plan and China's second five-year plan, and specific plans for developing trade and cultural exchanges.

The Japan Socialist Party recently published its first draft of a five-year economic plan. This draft advocates nationalizing basic industries and abolishing the "Defense Agency." The draft stipulates that steps should be taken to increase Japan's trade with China, the Soviet Union, other socialist countries, and Asian and African countries. The draft says, "Doing so will revise and completely change the current conservative government's policy of relying on the United States." The draft also states that the Socialist Party will also make resolute efforts to coordinate Japan's industrialization plans with those of China and other Southeast Asian countries.

    商谈恢复中日邦交等问题
    日本社会党将派代表团来我国
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎4日在山口县防府市说，社会党为了就同中国恢复邦交问题和两国之间的其他重要问题进行协商，已经决定在明年1月20日前后派遣一个正式的代表团到中国去。
    铃木说，他想台湾问题将不会成为中日两国关系正常化的大障碍。他指出，中国自己将会解决台湾问题，因为这是它的内部的问题。
    铃木说，将被派到中国去的社会党代表团将不是一般的亲善代表团或者考察代表团。它将同中国方面协商中日两国恢复邦交的方法、促进日本社会党的五年经济计划同中国的第二个五年计划之间的合作的具体方法、发展贸易和文化交流的具体方案等。
    日本社会党最近发表了它的第一个五年经济计划草案。这个草案主张把基本工业改归国有和废除“防卫厅”。草案规定要采取步骤来增加日本同中国、苏联和其他社会主义国家以及同亚非国家的贸易。草案说，“这样做将修正和完全改变日本现在的保守政府依赖美国的政策”。草案还说，社会党也将坚决努力使日本工业化计划同中国以及其他东南亚国家的计划配合起来。
