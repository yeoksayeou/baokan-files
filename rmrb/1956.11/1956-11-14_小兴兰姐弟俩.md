　　Little Xinglan and Her Younger Brother
　　Accountant Lao Li was engrossed in his work at his desk when a little girl came skipping in. Clutching her schoolbag, she shouted as soon as she crossed the threshold, "Uncle, the teacher wants the book money!" Lao Li quickly put down his pen and asked with a smile, "How much is it?" "One yuan." "Is that enough?" "Yes, it is." Lao Li thought for a moment, then took out one yuan and fifty cents from the drawer and handed it to her, kindly saying, "Here's an extra fifty cents. Besides paying for the books, buy some paper and pencils. Study hard!" "Okay!" The girl agreed and ran out happily with the money in her pocket. This girl is an orphan from the Wuer Agricultural Cooperative in Beizhen County, Liaoning. She is only eleven years old this year and her name is He Xinglan. She has a seven-year-old brother named He Xinggui.

　　One day in January this year, Xinglan's mother died of a serious illness, less than a year after her husband's death. The two children, left behind, wailed and cried, clinging to their mother's body. Relatives and neighbors were also worried about these two children who had lost their parents, but who could come up with a good solution? It was at this time that the Wuer Agricultural Cooperative took on the responsibility of supporting them. The cooperative first bought a coffin and buried the children's mother, and then settled them in the home of their relatives. From then on, the cooperative became their warm home.

　　This year, the cooperative took care of the two siblings in every possible way. Clothes, rice, firewood, and pocket money were all sent to them in a timely manner. Cooperative directors Wu Xiuyan and Zhang Zhenjin often visited them to comfort them and immediately solved any difficulties they had. They were especially well taken care of during festivals and when changing clothes between seasons, making them very happy. As soon as summer arrived, they were each given a new set of summer clothes. During the Dragon Boat Festival, Zhang Zhenjin brought meat, yellow rice, and reed leaves to their home. The cooperative members were also very concerned, often helping the children carry firewood and push the millstone.

　　In September, when the elementary school enrolled new first-graders, Xinglan, who hadn't been able to go to school when her mother was alive, went to school happily with the other children. Recently, the cooperative carried out the autumn harvest distribution, leaving enough food and pocket money for the two siblings, and bought more than twenty feet of twill fabric, which was sent to the cooperative's tailoring group to make cotton clothes for them.

    小兴兰姐弟俩
    会计员老李正伏在办公桌上聚精会神地办公，忽然从外面蹦蹦跳跳地跑进一个小女孩。她挟着书包，一迈进门坎，就喊：“叔叔，老师要书钱啦！”老李赶快撂下笔，笑着问道：“要多少钱哪？”“一块钱。”“够用吗？”“够了。”老李稍思索了一下，便从抽屉里取出一元五角钱递给她，亲切地嘱咐说：“多给你拿五角钱，除了交书钱，再买点纸、笔，要好好念书哇！”“嗯！”这个女孩一边答应，一边把钱揣在怀里，乐呵呵地跑出去了。这个女孩子，是辽宁北镇县五二农业社的孤儿。她今年才十一岁，名叫何兴兰，还有个七岁的弟弟，叫何兴贵。
    今年正月间的一天，兴兰的妈妈在丈夫死去不到一年的光景，也得重病死了。留下的两个孩子，抱着妈妈的尸体嚎啕痛哭。亲戚邻居也为这两个失去父母的孩子担忧，可是有谁能给想出个好办法呢？就在这个时候，五二农业社负起了扶养的责任。社里首先买棺材埋葬了孩子的妈妈，然后又把他们安置在他们的亲戚家里。从此，合作社就成了他们的温暖的家。
    这一年，社里对她姐弟俩的照顾，真是无微不至。穿衣呀、吃米呀、烧柴呀、零花钱呀，都及时地给他们送去。社主任吴秀岩、张振金，还时常到他们的住处去看望、安慰，稍有困难问题就马上给解决。逢年遇节、两季交接换衣服的时候，更是照顾得使他们乐呵呵的。刚一入夏，就给他俩每人做了一套新夏服；过端午节的时候，张振金又把肉、黄米、粽叶送到他们家里。社员们也很关心，常常替孩子背柴、推碾。
    9月间，小学招收一年级新生的时候，这个在妈妈活着还没能上学的小兴兰，和其他孩子们一起，欢欢乐乐地上学了。最近，社里进行秋收分配，给她姐弟俩留出了足够的口粮和零花钱，买了二十多尺斜纹布，送到社里的裁缝组，给他们赶制棉衣。
