    Long Live the Great Soviet Union, Defender of Peace!
    Today is the 39th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The Chinese people, who are confidently engaged in the great cause of socialist construction, together with the working people of the world, celebrate this glorious festival with boundless joy and gratitude, a festival that has opened the way to human happiness and a bright future.
    The existence of the socialist state of the Soviet Union, born from the victory of the October Revolution, and the vibrant fact of its growing strength, powerfully attract all oppressed people and make socialist ideas increasingly popular. In the short period of less than forty years, the socialist cause has developed rapidly. Today, the socialist countries of the world have formed a powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union. They possess nine hundred million people, accounting for more than one-third of the world's total population. They have become a continuous expanse in Europe and Asia, forming a powerful world system capable of mutual support and assistance.
    The socialist countries, headed by the Soviet Union, have established fraternal relations of mutual cooperation because they share the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism. In the mutual assistance and cooperation among socialist countries, the great and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union has played a particularly significant role. Soviet aid has not only enabled the rapid development of the backward economies of some fraternal countries, but also guaranteed their peace, security, territorial integrity, and sovereignty. The existence and development of the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, the great unity among the countries participating in this camp, and their jointly adopted peaceful and friendly policies in foreign relations have seriously undermined the imperialist schemes of aggression and expansion, and made their policies of aggressive war encounter increasing difficulties.
    Today, India, Egypt, Indonesia, Burma, and many other Asian and African countries have broken free from the shackles of colonial oppression and achieved national independence. Together with the socialist countries, they have formed a vast "peace zone" with a population of nearly fifteen hundred million. The vigorous development of national independence movements and the formation of a vast "peace zone" have become a serious obstacle to imperialism in pursuing its policies of aggression and war.
    In a situation where the wheels of history are constantly advancing towards peace, independence, and socialism, how terrified and heartbroken are the moribund imperialist reactionary forces! They fear the existence of socialist countries and their great unity as if they fear the end of the world. They are doing everything possible to carry out various conspiracies and tricks, trying to subvert socialist countries and carry out counter-revolutionary restoration in these countries. Recently, imperialist forces and Hungarian counter-revolutionaries, taking advantage of the masses' dissatisfaction with some of the mistakes made by the Party and the government in the past, launched an armed rebellion against the people's democratic system in Hungary, attempting to restore capitalism and fascism, which once put the people's democratic system and socialist cause of Hungary in danger. Now, with the assistance of the Soviet army, the Hungarian people have smashed the counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy, saved the socialist cause of Hungary and the national independence and people's democracy of Hungary, but the imperialist and counter-revolutionary forces will never be reconciled. In this situation, the people of socialist countries must strengthen the great unity of socialist countries a thousand times, consolidate the friendly relations between socialist countries and the Soviet Union, and completely smash all conspiracies of imperialist and counter-revolutionary forces.
    The imperialist reactionary forces fear the national independence movements of various countries as much as gophers fear the sun. In order to remove the obstacles on the road to implementing their plans of aggression and war, and in order to save the collapsing colonial rule system, the imperialist aggressors are using all means to oppose all countries that have just won national independence, and to destroy and suppress the national independence movements of various countries.
    British and French colonialists have launched a war of aggression against Egypt in collusion with Israel. The British and French naval and air forces have carried out frenzied war actions against Egypt, and British and French paratrooper units have landed in the Suez Canal area, preparing for a major offensive.
    The frenzied acts of aggression by British and French colonialists are not only aimed at destroying the independent country of Egypt, but also at restoring their colonial rule over the entire Middle East. The flames of war ignited in Egypt by British and French aggressors not only destroy peace and security in the Middle East, but also seriously threaten the entire world peace cause.
    Now, all peace-loving countries and people in the world unanimously protest against the heinous acts of the British, French, and Israeli aggressors in destroying peace, and resolutely demand an immediate stop to the aggression. The Soviet government has taken various measures to resolutely support the just struggle of the Egyptian people who have suffered aggression. The Soviet government has proposed to the US government to immediately use the troops of the US and the Soviet Union to stop the aggression of Britain and France. The Soviet Union has also submitted a proposal to the Security Council requesting that emergency and effective measures be taken to stop the war of aggression launched by Britain, France, and Israel. At the same time, the Soviet government sternly warned the British, French, and Israeli governments that "the Soviet government is determined to use force to eliminate the aggressors and restore peace in the East." This series of strong actions taken by the Soviet government fully proves that the Soviet Union is the most determined defender of world peace and the freedom and independence of Asian and African countries. We socialist countries, all people who love peace and advocate justice, must further unite and resolutely support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. Supporting the struggle of the Egyptian people is also fighting to defend peace, defend independence, and defend human justice and progress.
    Our people have formed an unbreakable fraternal alliance with the Soviet Union in the common cause of defending peace and striving for human progress. While celebrating the 39th anniversary of the great October Revolution, our people are determined to stand firmly with the people of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and with all peace-loving countries and people in the world, to fight against aggression, defend peace in Asia, Africa and the world, and promote the cause of human progress. Let us shout: Long live the great Soviet Union, defender of peace!

    伟大的和平保卫者苏联万岁！
    今天是伟大的十月社会主义革命三十九周年。正在满怀信心地进行伟大的社会主义建设的中国人民，和全世界劳动人民一起，以无限欢欣和感激的心情，来庆祝这个为人类幸福和光明未来开辟了道路的光辉节日。
    由于十月革命胜利而产生的社会主义国家苏联的存在和它愈来愈壮大的生动事实，强有力地吸引着一切被压迫的人民，使社会主义思想越来越深入人心。在不到四十年的短短时期中，社会主义事业已经得到了迅速的发展。现在在世界上的社会主义国家，已经组成了以苏联为首的强大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营，它们拥有了九亿人口，占据世界总人口的三分之一以上，它们在欧亚两洲已经连成一片，成为能够互相呼应、互相支援的强大的世界体系。
    以苏联为首的社会主义国家，由于它们具有马克思列宁主义的共同思想，因此已经建立了兄弟般的互相合作关系。在社会主义各国的互助合作中，苏联的伟大无私的援助起了特别显著的作用。苏联的援助不仅使一些兄弟国家落后的经济得到了迅速的发展，而且使它们的和平、安全、领土和主权的完整得到了保证。强大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营的存在和发展，参加这一阵营的各个国家相互之间的伟大团结，和它们在对外关系上共同采取的和平友好政策，严重地打击了帝国主义的侵略扩张阴谋，使它们的侵略战争政策遭到愈来愈大的困难。
    今天，印度、埃及、印度尼西亚、缅甸以及其他许多亚非国家已经挣脱了殖民压迫的锁链，取得了民族的独立，它们并且已经同社会主义国家一起，形成了拥有将近十五亿人口的幅员广阔的“和平地区”。民族独立运动的蓬勃发展和广大“和平地区”的形成，成为帝国主义在推行侵略和战争政策的道路上的严重障碍。
    在历史车轮向着和平、独立和社会主义不断前进的局势下，日暮途穷的帝国主义反动势力是多么恐惧、多么痛心疾首呵！它们像害怕世界末日一样地害怕社会主义国家的存在和它们之间的伟大团结。它们千方百计地进行各种阴谋诡计，力图颠复社会主义国家，在这些国家内实行反革命的复辟。最近帝国主义势力和匈牙利的反革命分子，利用群众对党和政府过去所犯的一些错误的不满情绪，向匈牙利的人民民主制度发动武装叛乱，力图实行资本主义和法西斯的复辟，曾经使匈牙利的人民民主制度和社会主义事业一度处在危险中。现在，匈牙利人民在苏军的援助下，虽然已经粉碎了反革命的复辟阴谋，挽救了匈牙利的社会主义事业和匈牙利的民族独立和人民民主，但是帝国主义和反革命势力是决不会甘心的。在这种情况下，社会主义各国人民就必须千百倍地加强社会主义各国的大团结，巩固社会主义各国同苏联的友好关系，彻底粉碎帝国主义和反革命势力的一切阴谋。
    帝国主义反动势力同样像土拨鼠害怕太阳一样地害怕各国的民族独立运动。为了扫除它们推行侵略和战争计划道路上的障碍，为了挽救正在解体的殖民统治制度，帝国主义侵略者正在使用一切手段，反对一切刚刚争得民族独立的国家，摧残和镇压各国的民族独立运动。
    英法殖民主义者已经伙同以色列向埃及发动了侵略战争，英法的海空军已经向埃及进行了疯狂的战争行动，英法的伞兵部队已经在苏伊士运河地区着陆，准备大举进攻。
    英法殖民者疯狂的侵略行动，不仅要摧毁埃及的这个独立国家，而且要恢复它们对整个中东的殖民统治。英法侵略者在埃及燃起的战火，不但破坏了中东的和平安全，而且严重地威胁着整个世界和平事业。
    现在全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民，都一致抗议英、法、以色列侵略者破坏和平的凶恶行为，坚决要求立即制止侵略。苏联政府已采取各种措施，坚决支援遭受侵略的埃及人民的正义斗争。苏联政府已向美国政府建议，立即调用美苏两国的军队制止英法的侵略。苏联并在安全理事会提出一项议案，要求采取紧急有效措施，制止英、法、以色列发动的侵略战争。苏联政府同时严厉警告英、法、以色列政府，“苏联政府决心使用武力来歼灭侵略者和恢复东方和平。”苏联政府所采取的这一系列有力的行动，充分证明了苏联是世界和平和亚非国家自由和独立的最坚决的保卫者。我们社会主义国家，一切爱好和平、崇尚正义的人们，必须进一步联合起来，坚决支援埃及人民的正义斗争。支援埃及人民的斗争，也就是为保卫和平、保卫独立和人类正义和进步事业的斗争。
    我国人民在保卫和平、争取人类进步的共同事业中，已同苏联结成了牢不可破的兄弟同盟。在欢庆伟大的十月革命三十九周年的时候，我国人民坚决同以苏联为首的社会主义各国人民在一起，并同世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民在一起，为反对侵略、保卫亚非和世界的和平、促进人类的进步事业而奋斗。让我们高呼：伟大的和平保卫者苏联万岁！
