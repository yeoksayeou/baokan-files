    Discussing the Issue of Restraining the Anglo-French Aggression Against Egypt
    Indonesia Decides to Invite the Prime Ministers of the Colombo Powers to a Meeting
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 2nd: The Indonesian cabinet decided on the evening of November 1st to invite the Prime Ministers of the other four Colombo Powers, namely Burma, Ceylon, India, and Pakistan, to hold a meeting as soon as possible to discuss the issue of restraining the Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt.
    The communique issued after the cabinet held a special meeting stated that after carefully studying the situation in the Middle East, the cabinet believes that the attacks by Israel, Britain, and France on Egypt and the bombing of Egyptian cities "are acts of aggression, which we strongly condemn." These acts of aggression are particularly worthy of condemnation because the Security Council is working towards a peaceful resolution.
    The communique stated: "The government believes that no member state of the United Nations, especially the permanent members of the Security Council, can decide everything solely based on its own intentions.
    The government demands that Israel, Britain, and France immediately cease their attacks, withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory, and act in accordance with the principles of the United Nations.
    The government also calls on all Asian and African countries that have solemnly expressed their support for the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference to work together to stop the aggression against Egypt, one of the participating countries of the Asian-African Conference."
    The communique stated: "In this regard, the government has invited the Colombo Powers to hold a meeting of Prime Ministers as soon as possible, as the first step in the efforts of Asian and African countries."

    商讨制止英法侵略埃及问题
    印度尼西亚决定邀请科伦坡国家总理开会
    新华社雅加达2日电　印度尼西亚内阁在11月1日晚上决定邀请缅甸、锡兰、印度和巴基斯坦其他四个科伦坡国家的总理尽早举行会议，来商讨制止英法武装侵略埃及的问题。
    内阁在举行特别会议以后发表的公报说，内阁在仔细地研究了中东情况以后认为，以色列、英国和法国对埃及的进攻以及对埃及城市的轰炸“是一种侵略行为，对此我们加以强烈的谴责”。这种侵略行为之所以特别需要加以谴责，是因为安全理事会正在致力于和平解决的时候。
    公报说：“政府认为，联合国中任何会员国、特别是安全理事会的常任理事国，不可以只根据本国的意图来决定一切。
    政府要求以色列、英国和法国立即停止它们的进攻，从埃及领土上撤退它们的军队，并且根据联合国的原则办事。
    政府还要求曾经庄严地表示支持万隆会议十项原则的所有亚非国家共同努力来制止对亚非会议参加国之一的埃及的侵略。”
    公报说：“在这方面，政府已经邀请科伦坡国家尽早举行总理会议，作为亚非各国的第一步努力。”
