Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 16th: The Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party held its 29th plenary session from November 12th to 14th and adopted a letter to the people of the German Democratic Republic.

    Socialist Unity Party Central Committee Politburo member, Mr. Hidewan, delivered a report on behalf of the Politburo at the meeting. In his report, he reviewed the implementation of the resolutions of the 28th Central Committee plenary session and presented the lessons that could be learned from international events. After discussion, the meeting unanimously approved the Politburo's report.

    Subsequently, Socialist Unity Party Central Committee First Secretary Ulbricht and Central Committee Secretary Ziller presented reports on the rights of workers in enterprises and the preparations for implementing the forty-five-hour workweek, respectively. In addition, the meeting heard a report on the issue of increasing pensions.

    The Central Committee plenary session endorsed Ulbricht's report on the Politburo's discussion of the rights of workers in enterprises and decided to publish this report as a basis for exchanging opinions on this issue and to submit it to enterprises for discussion. The meeting also decided to submit the plan to shorten working hours and the proposal to increase pensions to the People's Chamber and the government of the German Democratic Republic. The meeting also unanimously approved proposals for adjusting some organizational issues and decided to establish a Youth Affairs Committee.

    In the "Letter to the People of the German Democratic Republic" adopted at the meeting, it was stated: The millions of citizens of the German Democratic Republic, non-party masses and party members, large and small groups in enterprises, cities, and towns, deeply moved by the struggle of Hungarian workers and peasants to crush the counter-revolutionary rebellion and by Egypt's resistance to the Anglo-French armed aggression, have sent letters, letters of support, and resolutions to the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party. These letters and resolutions fully demonstrate the solidarity of the working people of democratic Germany with the German Socialist Unity Party, and also show that the party is consistent with the wishes and demands of all working people in word and deed.

    The letter praised the spirit of international solidarity shown by the working people in providing financial and material assistance to the people of Hungary and Egypt, and also praised the will and strength of the working people to crush all conspiracies of the enemies of the German Democratic Republic in the bud.

    In the letter to the people, the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party thanked the people of the republic for their support of the party and the government and wished them even greater success in the struggle and work of strengthening the worker-peasant power of the republic.
