Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 20th (TASS dispatch): Newspapers report that the US Ambassador to Syria delivered a note from the US government to the Syrian government. The note stated that, due to the suspension of navigation in the Suez Canal and the destruction of oil pipelines in some Arab countries, the US government requested the Syrian government to allow oil from the Kirkuk region (Iraq) to be transported through Syrian territory to Lebanese ports.

The newspapers stated that Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali and Foreign Minister Bitar had firmly rejected the US government's request. They said that there would be no discussion of transporting oil through Syrian territory until the British, French, and Israeli troops withdrew from Egypt. Because Syria is an ally of Egypt, agreeing to this request would be supplying materials to the Anglo-French war machine that is invading Egypt.

    美国要求假道运出石油
    叙利亚政府严词拒绝
    据新华社讯　塔斯社大马士革20日讯：报纸消息说，美国驻叙利亚大使曾经把美国政府的一个照会交给叙利亚政府。照会说，由于苏伊士运河航运停顿以及一些阿拉伯国家中的油管遭到破坏，美国政府请求叙利亚政府同意让基尔库克区（伊拉克）的石油通过叙利亚领土运往黎巴嫩港口。
    报纸说，叙利亚总理阿萨利和外交部长比塔尔已经坚决拒绝美国政府的要求。他们说，在英、法和以色列军队撤出埃及以前根本谈不到通过叙利亚领土运输石油的问题。因为叙利亚是埃及的盟国，它如果答应这个要求，那就是给侵略埃及的英法战争机器供应物资。
