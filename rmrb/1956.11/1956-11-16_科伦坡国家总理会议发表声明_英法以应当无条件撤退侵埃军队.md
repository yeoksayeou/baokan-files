Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 15th: The Colombo National Prime Ministers Conference held in New Delhi concluded on November 14th.

The Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, and Indonesia participated in the meeting. The Prime Minister of Pakistan did not attend.

In a statement issued after the meeting, the four Prime Ministers expressed satisfaction with the strong expression of world public opinion, both within and outside the United Nations, against the aggression against Egypt, and with the United Nations General Assembly's resolutions instructing the cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of British, French, and Israeli troops. However, the Prime Ministers noted with regret that the armed forces of Britain, France, and Israel had not yet withdrawn from Egypt, and that the aggressor governments had put forward various conditions which they believed had to be met before withdrawal could take place. The Prime Ministers strongly disapproved of the imposition of any such conditions and considered such reservations to be contrary to the instructions of the United Nations General Assembly. They believed that the Assembly's resolutions should be implemented immediately and fully, and that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Egyptian territory.

The statement said that the Prime Ministers welcomed the establishment of the United Nations International Force. This force should be temporary and its authority should be strictly limited to the scope of the instructions set out in the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. Any delay in the implementation of these resolutions and the withdrawal of foreign troops would further complicate the situation and exacerbate the current serious situation. As long as foreign troops have not completely withdrawn from Egyptian territory, it will be impossible to normalize the situation or consider any other issues.

In a joint statement, the four Prime Ministers, referring to the Hungarian event, said that they believed that Soviet troops should be withdrawn from Hungary quickly, and that the Hungarian people should be allowed to freely decide their own future and the form of government they will have, without any outside interference. The Prime Ministers commended the United Nations resolutions calling for immediate assistance to Hungary to alleviate hardship. The need for assistance in Egypt is equally pressing. They will recommend that their governments provide such assistance to both regions as far as possible, and they also believe that the whole world will fully express sympathy and generously assist this humanitarian cause.

The joint statement, referring to the Algerian issue, said that there, despite repression, the struggle for freedom continues. Recently, several Algerian leaders were arrested by the French authorities. This shows how bizarre things great powers can do in trying to suppress the demand for freedom.

After expressing opposition to the revival of colonialism, the joint statement said that the Prime Ministers firmly believed that world peace can only be guaranteed on the basis of freedom and disarmament. They also expressed opposition to military treaties and alliances.

The statement said that the Prime Ministers believed that the only path to peace is the realization of the Bandung Principles. They reaffirmed their adherence to these principles, including the Panchsheel Five Principles. The danger of war inherent in the current serious international situation is largely due to disregard of these principles and continued reliance on military treaties and the establishment of bases for armed forces in foreign countries. The Prime Ministers also believed that every effort should be made to support and strengthen the United Nations so that it can fulfill its mission of maintaining peace. They welcomed the continued close cooperation of the Asian-African group of countries in the United Nations.

The joint statement concluded by saying that recent events have cast a shadow of war over the world. The Prime Ministers hoped that the situation would improve, but in any case, serious dislocations have already occurred in the areas of economy, trade, shipping, and supply, and this situation may continue for some time. Colombo nations should take cooperative action on this issue, and any mechanism that is deemed necessary to conduct such joint consultations should be established.

### 科伦坡国家总理会议发表声明  英法以应当无条件撤退侵埃军队

    科伦坡国家总理会议发表声明
    英法以应当无条件撤退侵埃军队
    新华社新德里15日电　在新德里举行的科伦坡国家总理会议已经在11月14日闭幕。
    参加这次会议的有缅甸、锡兰、印度和印度尼西亚四国的总理，巴基斯坦总理没有参加。
    四国总理在会后发表的声明说，他们对于世界舆论在联合国内外都有力地表示反对侵略埃及，以及联合国大会通过了指示停止敌对行动和撤退英、法、以三国部队的决议，表示满意。但是，总理们遗憾地注意到，英、法、以三国武装部队还没有从埃及撤退，而且侵略国政府又提出了各式各样的条件，这些政府认为，在进行撤退以前，必须实现这些条件。总理们对提出任何这样的条件是很不以为然的，并且认为，这种保留条件是违背联合国大会的指示的。他们认为，应该立即彻底执行大会的决议，一切外国部队都应该撤出埃及领土。
    声明说，总理们欢迎成立联合国国际部队。这种部队应该是暂时的，它的职权应该严格地限制在联合国大会决议所提出的各种指示的范围内。如果在执行这种决议和撤退外国军队方面有任何拖延，就会使情况更加复杂，目前的严重局势就会更加严重了。只要外国部队一天没有完全撤出埃及领土，就无法使局势趋于正常，也无法考虑其他任何的问题。
    四国总理在联合声明中提到匈牙利事件时说，他们认为，苏联部队应该迅速撤出匈牙利，并且认为，应该让匈牙利人民在不受任何方面的外交干涉的情况下自由地决定他们自己的前途和他们将要获得的政府的形式。总理们称赞联合国所通过的呼吁立即向匈牙利提供援助来救济困难的决议。埃及对于援助的需要也是同样迫切的。他们将要建议他们的政府尽可能向这两个地区提供这种援助，他们也相信，全世界都将充分表示同情，慷慨地协助这种人道主义的事业。
    联合声明在提到阿尔及利亚问题时说，在那里，尽管进行镇压，争取自由的斗争还在继续下去。最近，几位阿尔及利亚的领袖被法国当局拘捕了。这表明，大国为了设法压制对自由的要求可以作出多么离奇的事情来。
    联合声明在表示反对殖民主义的复活之后说，总理们坚决认为，世界和平只有在自由和裁军的基础上才能得到保证。他们并且表示反对军事条约和联盟。
    声明说，总理们相信，和平的唯一道路就是实现万隆原则。他们重申他们遵守把潘查希拉五项原则包括在内的这些原则。目前严重的国际局势中包藏的战争危险，在很大程度上就是由于漠视这些原则、继续依靠军事条约和在外国为武装部队建立的基地而产生的。总理们还认为应该尽一切努力来支持和加强联合国，以使它履行它的维护和平的任务。他们欢迎联合国亚非集团国家不断进行密切的合作。
    联合声明最后说，最近的事件已经给全世界投上了战争的阴影。总理们希望局势好转，但是无论如何，在经济、贸易、航运和供应方面已经发生了严重的脱节情况，这种情况可能要继续一个时期。科伦坡国家应该在这个问题上共同采取合作性的行动，凡是认为进行这种联合磋商可能是必要的任何机构都应该建立起来。
