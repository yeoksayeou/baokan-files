Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar Telegram: The Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has adopted the method of special technical meetings to organize engineering and technical personnel and specialized technical workers to study and resolve eleven special technical problems encountered by the factory in the trial manufacture of new products.

The structure of new products such as the double-column vertical lathe and precision semi-automatic lathe trial-produced by the factory this year is more complex than the factory's previous products. For example, the tool holder spring of the vertical lathe is shaped like a watch mainspring, which has never been produced in China; some parts are very large, exceeding the processing capacity of the factory's equipment. Therefore, it often affects the progress of the new product trial production plan.

In the second half of this year, the factory strengthened the trial production of new products. First, the chief engineer, chief process engineer, and chief forging engineer formed a technical leadership core group to specifically guide process technicians in making various plans to solve special technical problems. Then, special technical meetings were held to organize relevant department and workshop leaders, engineering technicians, and skilled workers to discuss and revise the plans. In the past two months or so, through the discussion and on-site research of these technical meetings, the wisdom of the masses has been concentrated, and the technical problems that have been delayed for more than half a year have been solved.

Because workers who directly process parts participate in special technical meetings, workers have a deeper understanding of the processing methods, which can prevent quality accidents during processing.

In addition to leading discussions and determining plans at special technical meetings, the technical core group also inspects the processing of new products at the meetings, thereby promoting the progress of the trial production of new products. The parts of the three new vertical lathes trial-produced by this factory this year have entered the final assembly stage because special technical problems have been resolved. Soon, China's self-made new vertical lathes can be successfully trial-produced.

    通过专题研究会发扬职工智慧
    齐齐哈尔第一机床厂将制成新式立式车床
    据新华社齐齐哈尔电　齐齐哈尔第一机床厂采用专题技术会议的办法，组织工程技术人员和专业技术工人研究解决了工厂在新产品试制中出现的十一项特殊的技术问题。
    这个厂今年试制的双柱立式车床和精密半自动化车床等新产品的结构，都比工厂以往的产品复杂。像立式车床的刀架弹簧，形状像钟表发条，国内一向没有生产过；有的部件很大，超过工厂设备加工能力。因此往往影响新产品试制计划的进度。
    今年下半年，工厂加强了新产品试制工作，首先由总工程师、总工艺师、总锻冶师组成了技术领导核心组，具体指导工艺技术人员做出解决特殊技术问题的各种方案，然后召开专题技术会议，组织有关科室、车间负责干部、工程技术人员和技术工人进行讨论修正。两个多月以来，通过这些技术会议的讨论和实地研究，集中了群众智慧，把半年多来拖延未决的技术问题都解决了。
    由于吸收直接加工部件的工人参加专题技术会议，工人对加工方法领会较深，因此可以防止加工中的质量事故。
    技术核心组在专题技术会议上除了领导讨论和确定方案以外，还在会上检查新产品加工情况，从而推动新产品试制工作的进展。这个厂今年试制的三种新式立式车床的部件，由于特殊技术问题获得解决，现在已经进入总装配阶段。不久以后，我国自制的新式立式车床就可以试制成功。
