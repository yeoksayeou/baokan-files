Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd dispatch from New York: TASS reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov spoke on November 22nd at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly. His speech was entitled "The Responsibility of the United Nations to Block the Path of Aggression and Reactionary Forces."

Shepilov said that not long ago, the main characteristic of the international situation was the easing of tensions. This easing made it possible to hold the Geneva Four-Power Summit in 1955, which marked a new stage in the history of post-war international relations. However, the "Geneva spirit" displeased certain powerful groups interested in the arms race. They have always relied on dangerous provocations and adventurous policies to intensify international relations.

The Prestige and Future of the United Nations are at a Critical Juncture

Not long ago, military actions broke out in the Near East, which was the result of conspiracies against the freedom and independence of the Arab peoples. The armed aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt created a dangerous situation that endangered peace and sharply raised the threat of a third world war to the people of all countries.

In Eastern Europe, Hungarian fascist plotters, with the support of international reactionary forces, attempted to overthrow the people's democratic system, deprive the Hungarian people of the fruits of their democratic freedoms, and once again turn Hungary into a vassal state of the imperialist powers. However, this attempt failed.

The aggression against Egypt and the fascist rebellion in Hungary are two links in the same chain. Here is a manifestation of the far-reaching conspiracies with dangerous consequences perpetrated by certain international forces. In this situation, the United Nations' responsibility to maintain peace and security is particularly significant, and its prestige and future are at a decisive juncture.

The United Nations Should Firmly Demand that Britain, France, and Israel Withdraw from Egypt

Shepilov then sternly condemned the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt and refuted the various "reasons" put forward by the British and French governments to justify this act of aggression.

Shepilov said that the flames of war in the Near East have been extinguished, but the red-hot coals are still burning in the embers. Currently, the Soviet Union is very concerned that although a ceasefire has been superficially achieved in Egypt, the British, French, and Israeli troops in Egyptian territory are delaying their withdrawal, and there are reports that the interventionists are even concentrating their forces in the area. Therefore, as long as the invading troops remain in Egyptian territory, there is no guarantee that the war will not break out again. The United Nations General Assembly should once again firmly demand that the British, French, and Israeli troops immediately and completely withdraw from Egypt.

The Soviet delegation believes that measures must be taken to ensure that Israel will never again carry out new provocations against its neighbors and to ensure peace and tranquility in the Near East.

Regarding the United Nations International Police Force, Shepilov said that the General Assembly's decision to establish this force was a violation of the United Nations Charter. At the same time, as long as the British, French, and Israeli troops withdraw from Egypt, the United Nations police force is unnecessary. However, the Soviet delegation took into account that Egypt has expressed its consent to the entry of the United Nations force. In this case, it can be considered that the United Nations force can be stationed along the demarcation line between Israel and Egypt previously stipulated by the armistice agreement. After the British and French troops leave Port Said, the international force should no longer be stationed in Port Said and the entire Suez Canal area, and as long as Egypt deems it necessary, the United Nations force should immediately withdraw from the demarcation line and the entire Egyptian territory.

Shepilov said that at present, ensuring the immediate withdrawal of the invading forces from Egyptian territory is a cause that concerns the honor of the United Nations and the honor of all peace-loving forces.

The United Nations should also demand that Britain, France, and Israel stop creating threats or tensions on the Israeli-Jordanian border and the Israeli-Syrian border, and immediately stop any actions that may cause such a situation, in order to achieve genuine tranquility in this region of the Arab East.

Shepilov then spoke about the attempts by international reactionary forces to intensify the international situation by exploiting the Hungarian issue. He pointed out that one of the manifestations of the reactionary forces restoring the Cold War policy is the subversion carried out by relevant agencies in some Western countries against socialist countries. This "work" has long taken the form of unprecedented interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states.

The General Assembly Should Seriously Discuss the Soviet Union's Recent Disarmament Proposals

Shepilov then spoke about the issue of disarmament. He said that the issue of disarmament can and should be resolved. Our primary responsibility is not only to help eliminate the dangerous source of a new war in the Near East but also to create conditions that exclude the possibility of similar conflicts occurring again in the future. We support any practical measures that are conducive to the cause of peace. But what we need is not some expedient repairs on the edifice of peace, but a fundamental solution to the problems that trouble mankind.

Shepilov said that the main and most urgent issue of decisive significance for consolidating peace is disarmament. As long as we grasp this link, the entire international situation will fundamentally improve. The Soviet delegation requests the General Assembly to discuss the Soviet Union's recent disarmament proposals with due importance.

Propose Convening a World Economic Conference in 1957

When talking about the United Nations and international economic cooperation, Shepilov said that the Soviet Union advocates active economic cooperation on a world scale in the interests of the people of all countries. Differences in the social systems of various countries cannot and should not hinder this cooperation. Contrary to the slogan of the Atlantic Group "Let us arm!", our slogan is "Let us trade!". The United Nations and its economic organizations have not paid due attention to the issue of international trade. The illegal resolution adopted in 1950 prohibiting trade with the People's Republic of China has not yet been repealed, which cannot but hinder the development of healthy international economic ties. The Soviet delegation intends to submit a proposal on the establishment of a world trade organization within the framework of the United Nations, and requests this session to review it. This new institution can refer to the good experience accumulated by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, and the Economic Commission for Latin America in its work.

The Soviet delegation also proposes to hold a world economic conference in 1957, inviting all countries to participate, regardless of whether they are members of the United Nations. Such an economic conference will be able to discuss the following types of issues: 1. Further develop world trade and establish a world trade organization within the framework of the United Nations; 2. Implement international economic cooperation to help underdeveloped countries establish independent national economies; 3. International credit and financial issues.

The United Nations Cannot Stand Aside from the Struggle of Colonial Peoples

Shepilov then emphasized that the colonial system should be eliminated. He said that the great process of liberation and revival of the people of Asia and Africa is a characteristic of the present era. However, colonialism is far from being eliminated. Many countries are still in colonial and semi-colonial status. Even those countries that have recently gained independence often come into conflict with various forms of colonialism.

The United Nations cannot stand aside from the great process of liberation of colonial peoples.

Speaking of the issue of trusteeships, Shepilov suggested that the United Nations General Assembly should now adopt a resolution stipulating the shortest possible deadline for the independence of the people of each trust territory. He said that each trust territory should now have the right to send observers representing locally elected administrative bodies to attend United Nations meetings.

The Phenomenon of Excluding China from the United Nations Should End

Shepilov then said that the Soviet people, like the people of all peace-loving countries, once again express their great indignation that due to the fault of certain countries, the issue of the representation of the world's largest country—the People's Republic of China—in the United Nations has not been resolved at this session. Our primary and fundamental obligation is to correct this appalling injustice in the United Nations: the lack of legitimate representatives of the 600 million Chinese people. This not only involves the issue of respecting the inalienable rights of the People's Republic of China, but also, to a considerable extent, the issue of respecting the basic principles and prestige of the United Nations. It is time to end this unreasonable phenomenon.

Shepilov finally said that the people of all countries have put forward a common solemn demand to the representatives of the United Nations in various languages—strive for lasting peace, eliminate the atmosphere of hostility and mistrust in the international atmosphere, and ensure that mankind can engage in peaceful labor with peace of mind. Let us eliminate everything that hinders the improvement of the international situation and hinders the United Nations from fulfilling its important mission.

### 苏联外长在联大全体会议上指出  联合国应堵塞侵略和反动的道路

    苏联外长在联大全体会议上指出
    联合国应堵塞侵略和反动的道路
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫11月22日在联合国大会全体会议上发言，题目是“联合国的职责是堵塞侵略和反动势力的道路”。
    谢皮洛夫说，就在不久以前，国际局势的主要特点还是紧张局面的缓和。这种缓和使得有可能在1955年举行了标志着战后时期国际关系发展史上的新阶段的日内瓦四国政府首脑会议。但是，“日内瓦精神”却使某些同军备竞赛有利益关系的有势力集团感到不满意。他们一向指望借助于危险的挑拨和冒险政策使国际关系尖锐化。
    联合国的威信和前途处于严重关头
    不久以前，近东地区爆发了军事行动，这是阴谋反对阿拉伯各国人民的自由和独立的结果。英、法和以色列对埃及的武装侵犯造成了危及和平的危险局面，并且十分尖锐地向各国人民提出了第三次世界大战的威胁的问题。
    在东欧，匈牙利法西斯阴谋分子在国际反动势力的支持之下企图推翻人民民主制度，剥夺匈牙利人民所获得的民主自由的成果，重新把匈牙利变成帝国主义列强的附庸国。但是，这种企图失败了。
    对埃及的侵略和匈牙利的法西斯暴动是同一链条中的两个环节。这里表现了某些国际势力所搞的那些包藏着危险后果远大的阴谋。在这种情况下，联合国维护和平和安全的责任特别重大，它的威信和前途已经处在决定性的关头。
    联合国应坚决要求英法以从埃及撤军
    谢皮洛夫接着严词谴责了英、法和以色列对埃及的侵略，并且驳斥了英法政府为这种侵略行为辩护的种种“理由”。
    谢皮洛夫说，近东的战火就这样熄灭了，但是烧红的煤炭仍然在余烬中燃烧着。目前，苏联十分不安的是，虽然表面上在埃及已经停火，但是埃及领土上的英、法、以色列的军队却迟迟不撤退，而且有消息说，干涉者甚至还在这一地区结集兵力。因此，只要侵略军队仍旧留在埃及领土上，就没有任何保障保证战争不再起。联合国大会应该再一次十分坚决地要求英、法和以色列的军队立刻完全从埃及撤退。
    苏联代表团认为，必须采取措施使以色列今后再也不可能对邻国进行新的挑衅，确保近东的和平和安宁。
    至于联合国国际警察部队，谢皮洛夫说大会决定建立这支部队是违反联合国宪章的。同时，只要英、法和以色列军队撤出埃及，联合国警察部队就是没有必要的。但是，苏联代表团考虑到埃及已经表示同意联合国军队的进入。在这种情况下可以认为，联合国部队可以驻扎在以前由停战协定所规定的以色列和埃及的分界线沿线。在英、法军队离开塞得港以后，国际部队就不应当再驻扎在塞得港和整个苏伊士运河区，只要埃及认为有必要，联合国部队就应当立刻撤离分界线和整个埃及领土。
    谢皮洛夫说，在目前，保证侵略军立即撤出埃及领土是联合国荣誉攸关的事业、是全体和平力量荣誉攸关的事业。
    联合国还应当要求英国、法国和以色列停止在以色列—约旦边境和以色列—叙利亚边境造成威胁或紧张状态，立即停止可能造成这种局面的任何行动，以求在阿拉伯东方这一地区达到真正的平静。
    谢皮洛夫接着谈到国际反动势力利用匈牙利问题使国际局势尖锐化的企图。他指出，现在反动势力又在恢复冷战政策的表现之一就是一些西方国家的有关机关对社会主义国家所进行的颠覆。这种“工作”早已就采取了史无前例的干涉主权国家内政的形式。
    联大应认真讨论苏联最近的裁军建议
    谢皮洛夫接着谈到裁军问题。他说，裁军问题可以而且应当解决。我们首要的职责在于，不仅要帮助消除近东新战争的危险策源地，而且要创造排除今后再发生类似冲突的可能性的条件。我们赞同任何有利于和平事业的实际措施。但是我们需要的不是在和平大厦上做些权宜的修补工作，而是根本解决使人类感到不安的问题。
    谢皮洛夫说，对巩固和平有决定意义的主要和最迫切的问题是裁军，只要抓住这个环节，整个国际局势就会有根本的好转。苏联代表团要求大会以应有的重视来讨论苏联最近的裁军建议。
    建议1957年召开世界经济会议
    谢皮洛夫在谈到联合国和国际经济合作的问题时说，苏联主张本着各国人民的利益实行世界规模的积极经济合作。各国社会制度的不同不可能、也不应当妨害这种合作。和大西洋集团的口号“让我们武装起来！”相反，我们的口号是“让我们进行贸易！”。联合国和它的经济组织还没有对国际贸易问题予以应有的注意。1950年所通过的关于禁止和中华人民共和国进行贸易的非法决议，到现在还没有废除，这不能不阻碍健康的国际经济联系的发展。苏联代表团打算提出关于在联合国范围内建立一个世界性贸易组织的建议，请本届会议审查。这个新的机构在它的工作中可以参考联合国欧洲经济委员会、亚洲及远东经济委员会和拉丁美洲经济委员会所积累的良好经验。
    苏联代表团还建议在1957年举行世界经济会议，邀请一切国家参加，不问它们是否联合国会员国。这样一个经济会议将能讨论下列一类问题：一、进一步发展世界贸易，在联合国的范围内成立一个世界贸易组织；二、实行国际经济合作来帮助不发达国家建立独立的民族经济；三、国际信贷和金融问题。
    联合国不能置身殖民地人民斗争之外
    谢皮洛夫接着强调，殖民主义制度应当消灭。他说，亚非各国人民的解放和复兴的伟大过程是当代的特点。但是，殖民主义远还没有消灭。许多国家仍然处在殖民地和半殖民地地位。即使不久前获得独立的那些国家也会经常同各种形式的殖民主义发生冲突。
    联合国不能置身于殖民地人民解放的伟大进程之外。
    谈到托管地问题，谢皮洛夫建议联合国大会现在就通过一项决议，规定让各托管地人民独立的最短期限。他说，现在就应当让各托管地有权派遣观察员代表当地民选的行政机构出席联合国会议。
    应该结束排斥中国在联合国外的现象
    谢皮洛夫接着说，苏联人民和一切爱好和平的国家的人民一样，对由于某些国家的过错在这届大会上又没有解决世界上最大国家——中华人民共和国在联合国中的代表权的问题再次表示极大的愤慨。我们首要和基本的义务就是要纠正联合国的这种惊人的不公平的现象：没有六亿中国人民的合法代表。这不仅涉及到尊重中华人民共和国不可剥夺的权利问题，同时也在不小的程度上涉及到尊重联合国的基本原则和威望问题。应该是结束这种不合理现象的时候了。
    谢皮洛夫最后说，各国人民用各种言语向联合国代表提出了一个共同的庄严要求——争取持久和平、消除国际气氛中的敌视和互不信任的气氛以及保障人类安心从事和平劳动。让我们消灭一切妨碍国际局势好转、妨碍联合国履行它的重大使命的东西。
