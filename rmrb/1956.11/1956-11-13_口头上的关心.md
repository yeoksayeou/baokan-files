    Lip Service
    The newly built activated carbon workshop of the state-owned Tianjin Oil and Fat Chemical Factory was officially put into production on June 13th of this year. People would surely think that working in this new factory building would be very fortunate! But in reality, this is not the case. As soon as the workers enter the workshop, a dry, smoky smell hits them. The temperature in the firing furnace is above 1000 degrees Celsius, but there is no insulation equipment around the furnace wall. The radiant heat black globe temperature between furnace No. 2 and furnace No. 3 is as high as 95 degrees Celsius. Flames shooting out of the furnace opening are one or two feet long. Under such conditions, according to regulations, workers should only stay for 50 to 60 seconds, but in reality, workers work continuously for 40 to 50 minutes. Not only is there no fire barrier equipment in front of the furnace, but there are also no protective devices.
    Although the factory leaders repeatedly say "We are very concerned about the workers," the reality is quite different. During the preparation for the construction of the activated carbon workshop and after the workshop was put into production, the safety technology section raised the issue of paying attention to this problem, but it did not receive the support it deserved. Only after worker Sun Dianhe's hair, eyebrows, and beard were burned off did the factory buy two sets of asbestos clothing. But with four people operating at the same time, they had to wear the upper and lower parts separately, which still could not guarantee safe operation. May I ask: How can people believe that the leadership is "very concerned about the workers"?

### 口头上的关心

    口头上的关心
    国营天津油脂化学厂新建的活性炭车间，今年6月13日才正式投入生产。人们一定会以为在这座新厂房里工作该是多么幸运！其实不然，工人们一走进车间，干燥的夹着煤烟的气味就扑鼻而来。烧料炉里的温度在摄氏一千度以上，但是炉壁的四周没有隔热的设备，二号炉和三号炉之间的辐射热黑球温度高达摄氏九十五度，从炉口喷射出来的火苗有一、二尺远，在这样的情况下，按理工人只能停留五十秒至六十秒钟，实际上工人却连续工作四、五十分钟。炉前不但没有挡火设备，而且连防护用具也没有。
    工厂的领导人虽然一再说“我们是很关心工人的”，但实际上是另一回事。在筹建活性炭车间以及车间投入生产以后，安全技术科都提出过要注意这个问题，但没有得到应有的支持。直到工人孙殿和的头发、眉毛、胡子都被烧光以后，厂里才买了两套石棉衣。但四个人同时操作，只好上身下身分开穿，结果还是不能保证安全操作。请问：怎能使人相信领导上是“很关心工人”的？　　任象琦
