Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 21st: Since the beginning of this year, twenty-one mechanical factories in Shenyang, including Shenyang Water Pump Factory, have promoted more than 3,000 cadres, more than three times the number promoted in the entire last year. Among them, more than 980 newly promoted enterprise management personnel and engineering technicians have supported emerging industrial sectors, and the remaining two-thirds of the newly promoted cadres have strengthened the leadership of Shenyang's mechanical industrial enterprises. Now, the shortage of cadres, which has persisted for a long time, has been basically reversed in Shenyang's mechanical factories.

The improvement in the cadre situation in Shenyang's mechanical industry system is mainly due to the strengthening of cadre management, cultivation, and training work by the Chinese Communist Party organizations in the enterprises. In the twenty-one mechanical factories in Shenyang, 76% of the Chinese Communist Party branches have formulated work plans for cultivating and promoting cadres. The factories have successively selected more than 1,300 cadres at the level of section chief, workshop director, and party branch secretary to participate in technical schools or training courses to study various professional knowledge. In addition, more than 43,000 mechanical workers have participated in various studies this year, an increase of 70% compared to last year.

In order to summarize and exchange the experience of various factories in cultivating, training, promoting, and managing cadres, the Second Industrial Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a cadre work conference of mechanical industrial enterprises in mid-November, which summarized the cadre training, promotion, and management work of the past year, and introduced the cadre work experience of seven units including Shenyang Water Pump Factory.

    缺乏干部莫叫苦，积极培养是正途
    沈阳二十一个机床厂年来提拔三千多名干部
    新华社沈阳21日电　沈阳水泵厂等二十一个机械工厂今年以来已经提拔了三千多名干部，比去年全年提拔的干部多三倍以上。其中有九百八十多名新提拔的企业管理人员和工程技术人员支援了新兴的工业部门，其余三分之二新提拔起来的干部加强了沈阳机械工业企业的领导力量。现在，沈阳各机械工厂基本上已经扭转了长时期来干部不足的局面。
    沈阳机械工业系统的干部状况能够好转，主要是因为中国共产党组织在企业中加强了对干部的管理和培养训练工作。在沈阳的二十一个机械工厂里，有占76％的中国共产党支部都订有培养和提拔干部的工作规划。各工厂已经先后选拔了一千三百多名科长、车间主任、党支部书记以上干部参加技术学校或训练班，学习各种专业知识。此外，今年参加各种学习的机械工人有四万三千多人，比去年增加了70％。
    中共沈阳市委员会第二工业部，为了总结和交流各工厂培养训练、提拔、管理干部的工作经验，在11月中旬召开了机械工业企业干部工作会议，对一年来的干部培训、提拔、管理工作作了总结，介绍了沈阳水泵厂等七个单位的干部工作经验。
