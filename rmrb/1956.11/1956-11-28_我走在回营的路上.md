I walk on the road back to camp,
The sunlight gleams on my bayonet.
Who is singing nearby?
The song is so loud and clear.
Is it the Yi people's lusheng providing accompaniment?
Or the Tibetan people's erhu?
Which girl is pouring out her love?
Which young man is proposing to her?
Miao people, don't play your bamboo琴,
Herdsman, please stop your flute,
Tell me, what festival is today,
Why is everyone so jubilant?!
Ah, you are having a get-together with the exploration team from Beijing,
Awakening the sleeping mountains with song;
The ore clangs under their hammers,
The treasures in the mountains shine in their hands.
Honored guests from Beijing,
Tents can be pitched everywhere here,
Wild beasts will not hinder your work,
We are standing guard on the mountaintops!

    我走在回营的路上
    藏族战士　饶阶巴桑
    我走在回营的路上，
    刺刀上闪耀着阳光。
    是谁在附近唱歌？
    歌声是这样的嘹亮。
    伴奏的是彝族的芦笙？
    还是藏族的胡琴？
    是哪位姑娘在倾吐爱情？
    是哪位小伙子向她求婚？
    苗家的竹琴不要吹动，
    牧人呵，请停一停你的笛声，
    告诉我，今天是什么节日，
    大家为什么这样欢腾？！
    呵，你们同北京来的勘探队联欢，
    用歌声唤醒了沉睡的群山；
    矿石在他们铁锤下铿锵，
    山中的宝贝在他们手里发光。
    来自北京的贵客呵，
    这儿到处可以搭起篷帐，
    野兽不会妨碍你们工作，
    有我们在山头上站岗！
