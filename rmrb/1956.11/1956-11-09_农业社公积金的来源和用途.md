Answering Readers' Questions

	Readers have written in to reflect that some agricultural production cooperatives, when formulating distribution plans, deduct agricultural taxes, management fees, public accumulation funds, and public welfare funds from the total income, and then distribute the remainder entirely to the members. Some of these agricultural cooperatives, which do not deduct production costs, either keep the public accumulation fund as next year's production costs or count the share fund as this year's production expenditure. The amount of the public accumulation fund deducted also varies. Some readers are also unclear about what public accumulation fund is, how to deduct it, and how to use it, and hope for answers. Now, based on the demands they have raised, the relevant questions about the public accumulation fund are answered as follows:

	The public accumulation fund is the public accumulation in the agricultural cooperative. Its sources are roughly in three aspects: First, a portion is deducted from the agricultural cooperative's annual income; second, the bonuses issued to the agricultural cooperative by the government and the money donated to the cooperative by others; third, the appreciation of fixed assets (such as small trees growing into forests, etc.). The most important source is a portion deducted from the total income of agricultural and sideline industries. How to deduct it? According to the regulations of the model charter for advanced agricultural production cooperatives, the agricultural cooperative should, under the principle of both enabling the members' personal income to increase year by year and increasing the public accumulation of the agricultural cooperative, retain a certain proportion of the public accumulation fund (including the repayment of due basic construction loans and investments) from the annual income. This proportion generally shall not exceed 8% of the actual income (total income minus various production consumption), and cooperatives planting cash crops can increase it to 12%. However, cooperatives with small income increases can retain less, and in the event of a famine year, they can retain less or not at all. In a bumper harvest year, on the premise of ensuring the increase of the members' personal income, they can also retain more. Regarding the use of the public accumulation fund, there are also clear regulations in the model charter for advanced cooperatives: "The public accumulation fund shall be used for production expenses needed to expand production, reserve seeds, feed, and increase the fixed assets of the cooperative, and shall not be used for other purposes." Specifically, it can be used in three aspects: First, it can be used for capital construction on the land and the cost of adding means of production, such as repairing land, maintaining water and soil, digging wells, opening canals, building dikes and dams, building small reservoirs, reclaiming wasteland, afforestation, and purchasing livestock, large farm tools, agricultural machinery, sideline production equipment, etc. When carrying out these constructions and purchases, productive expenditures should be the main focus, and non-productive expenditures, such as building offices, purchasing recreational supplies, etc., can be postponed at present when income increases are not large. Second, it is used as a reserve fund. Such as reserving some seeds, feed, and other necessary materials to prevent disasters and crop failures. Third, it is used as working capital for expanded reproduction. In addition to the above expenditures, the public accumulation fund cannot be used for other purposes. Therefore, it is incorrect to regard the public accumulation fund as production costs, and production costs should be retained from the total annual income.

	The share fund is the bottom money paid by members when joining the cooperative. Part of it can be used to purchase members' means of production, and part of it can be used as production costs. The part used as production costs should be deducted and kept after the autumn harvest for use again next year.

### 农业社公积金的来源和用途

    农业社公积金的来源和用途
    读者来信反映：有些农业生产合作社在制定分配方案时，从总收入中扣除了农业税、管理费、公积金和公益金以后，便全部分给了社员。这些没有扣除生产费的农业社，有的把公积金留作明年的生产费，有的把股份基金算了今年的生产开支。扣除公积金的数量也多少不一。还有些读者对什么是公积金，怎样扣除和怎样使用公积金也搞不清楚，希望解答。现在根据他们提出的要求，把有关公积金的问题答复如下：
    公积金是农业社里的公共积累，它的来源大约有三个方面：一、从农业社每年的收入中扣除一部分；二、政府发给农业社的奖金和别人赠送给社里的钱；三、固定财产的增值（如小树成林等）。其中最主要的来源是从农副业总收入中扣除的一部分。怎样扣除呢？根据高级农业生产合作社示范章程的规定，农业社在既能使社员的个人收入逐年有所增加，又能增加农业社公共积累的原则下，应该从每年的收入中留出一定比例的公积金（包括归还到期的基本建设贷款和投资在内）。这个比例一般不得超过实际收入（总收入除去各项生产消耗）的8％，种植经济作物的社可以增加到12％。但是，增加收入不多的社可以少留些，遇到荒年也可以少留或不留，丰收年在保证社员个人收入增加的条件下，也可以多留些。关于公积金的用途，在高级社示范章程中也有明确规定：“公积金用作扩大生产所需要的生产费用、储备种籽、饲料和增添合作社固定财产的费用，不能挪作他用。”具体地说，可以用在三个方面：一、用作在土地上进行基本建设和添置生产资料的费用，如修整土地、保持水土、打井、开渠、修堤筑坝、建筑小型水库、垦荒、造林以及购买牲畜、大型农具、农业机器、副业生产设备等。在进行这些建设和购置的时候，应当以生产性的开支为主，非生产性的开支，如修建办公室、购买文娱用品等，在目前收入增加不多的情况下，可以酌情缓办。二、用作储备基金。如储备一些种籽、饲料和其他必需物资，以防灾荒和歉收等。三、用作扩大再生产的周转费。除以上几项开支外，公积金不能挪作其他用途。因此，把公积金当作生产费是不对的，生产费应当在每年的总收入中留下。
    股份基金是社员入社时交纳的底垫。它的一部分可作为收买社员生产资料用，一部分作为生产费。作生产费的部分，秋收后要扣下留着明年再用。
