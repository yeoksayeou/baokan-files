Speech by Vice Chairman Li Jishen at a Meeting Held by the CPPCC National Committee

Respectable Mr. U Nu:
Friends and Comrades:

Today, the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference invites Mr. U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, an old friend of the Chinese people who is currently on a friendly visit to our country, to speak. On behalf of all members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I extend a warm welcome to Chairman U Nu.

As everyone knows, Mr. U Nu is an outstanding Burmese politician and one of the initiators of the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He has made many contributions to promoting Sino-Burmese friendship, strengthening the unity of Asian and African countries, and safeguarding world peace. His name is very familiar and dear to the Chinese people.

The Burmese people waged a long and heroic struggle against colonial rule to achieve national independence and achieved victory eight years ago. In recent years, the Burmese people have also made great achievements in building their own country. These are inseparable from the efforts of Mr. U Nu, one of the founders of the Burmese nation.

Mr. U Nu, along with other leaders of the Colombo countries, actively initiated and participated in the historic Asian-African Conference and powerfully promoted unity and cooperation among Asian and African countries. At the Asian-African Conference, he pointed out: "We must eliminate any idea that war is inevitable. War is a luxury that mankind can no longer afford. Mankind must turn its thoughts to peace and oppose war." In September 1955, Mr. U Nu also said, "Continuous efforts should be made to eradicate colonialism, which is the root of the disease that endangers the cause of peace." This opposition to colonialism, opposition to war, and full of confidence in the inevitable victory of peace greatly encouraged the anti-colonial struggle of Asian and African countries and peoples.

Mr. U Nu is a good friend of the Chinese people. He has always expressed sympathy and support for all efforts made by the Chinese people to safeguard national independence, promote international peace, and friendship. In 1954, the Prime Ministers of China and Burma jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which brought the traditional friendship between China and Burma into a new stage. The economic trade, technical cooperation, and cultural exchanges between our two countries have been significantly developed, and the friendly exchanges between the two peoples have become more frequent. The Chinese people will never forget a person like Mr. U Nu who has played a foundational role in the new friendly relations between China and Burma. Although Mr. U Nu no longer holds a position in the Burmese government, as the Chairman of the ruling party of Burma, the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, he is working closely with Prime Minister U Ba Swe of the Burmese Federation to continue to strengthen the friendly cooperation between China and Burma.

This time, Mr. U Nu came to our country for a visit and held friendly talks with our national leaders. We believe that these talks will further enhance the friendly relations between the two countries and will also be conducive to the unity of Asian and African countries and world peace.

Now, we invite Mr. U Nu to speak.

    在政协全国委员会举行的集会上
    李济深副主席的讲话尊敬的吴努阁下：朋友们、同志们：
    今天中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会邀请现在我国进行友好访问的中国人民的老朋友、缅甸联邦反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努阁下讲话。我代表中国人民政治协商会议全体委员向吴努主席表示热烈的欢迎。
    大家知道，吴努阁下是缅甸的杰出政治家，是著名的和平共处五项原则的倡议人之一，对促进中缅友好、加强亚非国家团结和维护世界和平有过很多贡献，他的名字对于中国人民是十分熟悉而且很亲切的。
    缅甸人民为了反对殖民主义统治，争取民族独立曾经进行长期的英勇斗争，并且在八年前取得了胜利。这几年来，缅甸人民在建设自己国家的事业中又取得了很大的成就。这些都是和作为缅甸国家的缔造人之一——吴努阁下的努力分不开的。
    吴努阁下和其他科伦坡国家的领袖一道，积极发起和参加了具有历史意义的亚非会议，并有力地推进了亚非国家之间的团结和合作。他在亚非会议上曾经指出：“要把任何认为战争不可避免的思想袪除，战争是人类再也不能够负担得起的奢侈品，人类必须把思想转向和平，反对战争。”1955年9月吴努阁下又说道，“应当进行不断的努力来根除殖民主义，它是危害和平事业的疾病的根源。”这种反对殖民主义、反对战争和充满了对和平必然胜利的信心，大大鼓舞了亚非国家和人民反殖民主义的斗争。
    吴努阁下是中国人民的好朋友，他对中国人民维护民族独立、促进国际和平和友好的一切努力一向表示同情和支持。1954年中缅两国总理共同倡导了和平共处的五项原则，使得中缅两国的传统友谊进入了一个新的阶段，我们两国间的经济贸易、技术合作、文化交流得到了显著的发展，两国人民的友好往来更加频繁了。中国人民对于像吴努阁下这样一位对中缅两国新的友好关系起过奠基作用的人，是绝不会忘记的。现在吴努阁下虽然不再在缅甸政府中担任职位，但是作为缅甸执政党，缅甸联邦反法西斯人民自由同盟的主席，他正和缅甸联邦政府吴巴瑞总理紧密合作，继续为加强中缅两国友好合作而努力。
    这次，吴努阁下来我国访问并同我国国家领导人进行友好会谈。我们相信，这些会谈将会进一步增进两国的友好关系，同时也会有利于亚非各国的团结和世界和平。
    现在，我们请吴努阁下讲话。
