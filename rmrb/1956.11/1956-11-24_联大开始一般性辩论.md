Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the 22nd for a general debate. Representatives from France, the Soviet Union, the United States, Ceylon, and other countries delivered speeches at the meeting.

    French Foreign Minister Pineau, in his speech, tried his best to defend the military actions of France and Britain in invading Egypt. He said that the "main actions taken by France and Britain in Egypt were to bomb airports and destroy aircraft on the ground. Warnings were always given during the planned joint bombings so that Egyptian personnel had time to take cover." However, Pineau admitted that "the Port Said incident was an exception."

    Pineau attempted to equate the Anglo-French military aggression against Egypt with the struggle of the Hungarian people to defend their socialist achievements, and incited the desire of some countries to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs, saying that "either the United Nations makes every country accept its decisions, or it should not impose its decisions on any country," attempting to find excuses for the delay of France and Britain in withdrawing their invading troops from Egypt.

    Pineau said that the Soviet Union's recent disarmament proposals "did not help at all" in solving the disarmament issue.

    Pineau also said that the Algerian issue is "a domestic French issue outside the jurisdiction of the United Nations."

    After Pineau's speech, Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov made a long speech.

    The speech of US representative Lodge showed that the US government intended to reject the Soviet disarmament proposal once again. Lodge said that the Soviet agreement to implement "aerial photography" in specific areas was not the plan proposed by the United States earlier. He said that the US plan was to conduct aerial photography over the Soviet Union.

    The head of the Ceylon delegation, Bandaranaike, demanded that Britain, France, and Israel immediately withdraw their troops invading Egypt. He said, "The situation in Egypt remains dangerous. It is not necessary for a large number of United Nations troops to arrive on the scene before the troops of the three invading countries begin to withdraw."

    Bandaranaike also advocated restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations to make the United Nations a truly representative international organization.

    Representatives from Austria, the Philippines, Jordan, Libya, Tunisia, and many other countries also spoke at yesterday's meeting.

    Before the general debate yesterday, the General Assembly had already resumed the general debate on the evening of the 21st. At that meeting, representatives from Australia, New Zealand, and Spain tried their best to defend the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt. The Italian representative tried to distort the truth of the Hungarian incident and slander the Soviet Union. The head of the Greek delegation, Karamanlis, talked about the continuing existence of colonialism and Greece's unsuccessful attempts to resolve the Cyprus issue in the United Nations. He also talked about the issue of countries gradually disarming before achieving complete disarmament.

    联大开始一般性辩论
    据新华社23日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会22日全体会议进行一般性辩论，法国、苏联、美国、锡兰等国家的代表在会上发了言。
    法国外交部长比诺在发言中竭力替法英两国侵略埃及的军事行动辩护。他说，法英两国“在埃及采取的主要行动是轰炸机场，炸毁地面上的飞机。在进行计划中的联合轰炸时，总是作出警告，使埃及人员来得及躲避”。可是，比诺承认，“塞得港事件是一个例外”。
    比诺力图把英法对埃及的军事侵略同匈牙利人民捍卫社会主义成果的斗争相提并论，并且煽动某些国家干涉匈牙利内政的欲望，说什么“联合国要末使每一个国家接受它的决定，要末就不要把它的决定加之于任何一个国家”。企图为法、英两国迟迟不肯撤退侵略埃及的军队寻找借口。
    比诺说，苏联最近的裁军建议对于裁军问题的解决“丝毫没有助益”。
    比诺还说阿尔及利亚问题是
  “在联合国职权范围以外的法国内政问题”。
    在比诺发言以后，苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫作了长篇发言。
    美国代表洛奇的发言显示了美国政府打算再一次拒绝苏联的裁军建议。洛奇说，苏联同意在特定地区实行“空中摄影”的计划不是美国早先建议的计划。他说，美国的计划是要去苏联进行空中摄影。
    锡兰代表团团长班达拉奈克要求英、法和以色列立即撤退它们侵略埃及的部队。他说，“埃及的局势仍然是危险的。不一定先要大量的联合国部队到场然后三个侵略国家的部队才开始撤退。”
    班达拉奈克还主张恢复中国在联合国的合法席位以使联合国成为一个具有真正代表性的国际机构。
    昨天会议上发言的还有奥地利、菲律宾、约旦、利比亚、突尼斯等许多国家的代表。
    在昨天进行一般辩论以前，大会在21日晚间还已经恢复了一般辩论。在那一次会上，澳大利亚、新西兰和西班牙的代表竭力替英、法侵略埃及的行动辩护。意大利代表极力歪曲匈牙利事件的真相并且污蔑苏联。希腊代表团团长卡拉曼利斯谈到殖民主义仍然存在，希腊想在联合国解决塞浦路斯问题还没有成功。他还谈到在实现全面裁军以前，各国先逐步裁军的问题。
