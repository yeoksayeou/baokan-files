    Pay Attention to Selecting and Publishing Readers' Opinions from Various Regions
    The People's Daily has a "Reader Forum" column, which fills the newspaper with the voices of the masses. However, most of the published articles are from readers in Beijing. For example, the three articles published on October 18th under the title "Supporting the Just Struggle of Bao Huier and Others" were all written by readers in Beijing. Publishing articles from Beijing readers may be more timely, but some "Reader Forums" appear in the newspaper several days after the event occurred. The People's Daily is a national newspaper, and it should pay attention to selecting and publishing readers' opinions from various regions.

    注意选登各地读者的意见
    人民日报辟有“读者论坛”专栏，使报纸上充满群众的声音。但发表的多是北京读者的，如10月18日发表的以“支持鲍惠尔等人的正义斗争”为题的三篇稿件，都是北京读者所写。发表北京读者的稿件也许及时些，但有些“读者论坛”是事件发生后好几天才见报的。人民日报是全国性的报纸，可以注意选登各地读者的意见。
