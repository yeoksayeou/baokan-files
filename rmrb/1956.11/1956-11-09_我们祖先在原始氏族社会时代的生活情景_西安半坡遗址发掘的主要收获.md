    The Living Scenarios of Our Ancestors in the Primitive Clan Society Era
    ——Major Gains from the Excavation of the Banpo Site in Xi'an—— 　 Shi Xingbang
    Historians, based on legends and textual research, believe that in ancient times, the main areas of activity of our ancestors were in the Central Plains of the Yellow River basin and the Northwest region. Indeed, on the terraces along the rivers in today's Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Gansu provinces, many Neolithic cultural sites have been discovered. Among them, the most numerous and widely distributed, we call the "Yangshao Culture" sites, because the artifacts belonging to this cultural system were first discovered in Yangshao Village, Mianchi County, Henan Province.
    The "Yangshao Culture" sites are the most precious cultural treasures left by our ancestors four or five thousand years ago. We can regard each site as a complete museum preserving our ancestors in the primitive clan society era. As long as it is excavated, we can see a relatively complete picture of their lives at that time. At the same time, they are also good libraries for studying the living conditions of our ancestors at that time. As long as it is opened, we can understand: how our ancestors lived, how they struggled with nature to obtain the necessities of life, what tools they used for labor and production, what houses they lived in, what food they ate, what clothes they wore, what kind of social life they led, and what their living customs, ideologies, and religious beliefs were like. All of these, in the past, we could only glimpse a shadow from vague myths and legends or far-fetched documentary records. However, now, with the rapid development of our people's archaeological work, in our archaeological research and excavation work of these ancient cultural sites, we can personally see the true living conditions of our ancestors at that time.
    One of these many underground museums and primitive libraries – the Yangshao Culture site in Banpo, Xi'an – has been excavated by us in the past two years. Although the area we have excavated is less than half of the total area, the material cultural remains left by the people at that time are very rich, which can help us to explain the general situation of our ancestors' lives at that time.
    Economic Life Mainly Based on Agriculture
    The natural environment of the Banpo site is very beautiful. Behind it is the historically famous Baling Plateau, and in front of it is the Chan River, one of the eight rivers of Chang'an. In the middle is a fertile river valley terrace, and the site is in the center of this terrace. Our ancestors chose such a fertile land and settled down to manage the common life of their clan. Within the clan territory, the residential area was in the center of the site, the kiln site for firing pottery was in the east, the public cemetery for burying the dead was in the north, and a ditch separated the cemetery and the residential area. Such a division of areas can precisely illustrate the general characteristics of primitive clan society.
    At that time, the lives of our ancestors mainly relied on engaging in agricultural production activities. The labor production tools they used included stone axes, stone adzes, stone knives, pottery knives, bone saws, bone hoes, and other roughly made stone tools. They may have also used wooden digging sticks and other things. They used these primitive and simple tools to cut down trees, cultivate land, sow grains, and harvest crops on the nearby river valley terrace. The grain they planted, as far as we know, was millet, which is common in North China today. In the autumn of 1954, a pottery jar containing millet was discovered in a small pit under a house. Although the millet in the jar was decayed, its husks still looked very clear. Also, last year, a pile of grain husks was found in a cellar inside the No. 7 square house. Without a fairly developed agriculture, there would be no such remains. Sedentary life is an inevitable phenomenon of agricultural production development and an important proof of agricultural production development. The development of agricultural production enabled our ancestors to live here for a relatively long time. This fact can be illustrated by the rich cultural accumulation layer, which is four or five meters deep. However, from the perspective of the level of productive forces at that time, agriculture was still in the stage of hoeing agriculture. Due to the weakness and inability to cope with natural disasters, this primitive form of agricultural production alone could not guarantee their carefree life. Therefore, in addition to farming, our ancestors also engaged in various auxiliary production activities such as raising livestock, hunting, fishing, and collecting wild fruits to make up for the shortage of their means of living.
    We know that the domesticated animals raised at that time were dogs and pigs. The main hunting target was deer. The hunting tools were mostly bows and arrows and spears. Most of the arrowheads were made of bone. These arrowheads were not only diverse in style but also exquisitely made and very sharp. The spearheads were made of bone and stone. In primitive times, there was not much difference in the function of weapons and tools, so stone axes and wooden sticks were also often used as hunting tools. Fishing seemed to be quite developed at that time. We discovered many bone fishhooks, fish spears, and stone flakes used as net sinkers. The most prominent of these is the fishhook. Although it is made of bone, its craftsmanship and beauty are comparable to those made of steel wire today. In addition, many colored pottery wares are decorated with realistic fish patterns. All of these can illustrate that fishing occupied an important position in life at that time. Although the gathering economy was in a secondary position at that time, it still existed; we often found fruit pits left over from their food in the ash soil, around the houses, or next to the stove. In short, at that time, everything in the surrounding nature that people's strength could achieve and could be used as food, our ancestors took it to enrich their lives.
    What can best reflect the living conditions at that time are the houses they lived in. Our ancestors lived in two different types of houses at that time, one was round and the other was square; the round ones were more numerous than the square ones, and the construction technology was also more advanced. Whether round or square, their common features were: the doors of the houses all faced south, and there were two very low partition walls on both sides of the entrance. In the middle of the house was a stove pit for burning fire, which is the same as the habits of many fraternal ethnic groups today. These houses were often piled together one above the other, which can illustrate the length of time they lived here and the situation of the evolution before and after. Now, let us look at the structure and characteristics of various houses.
    Square houses are divided into two categories: square and rectangular. The shape is square or rectangular, and the four corners are round. The area is usually about sixteen to thirty-six square meters. Only one square house discovered in 1954 was relatively large. One side that was well preserved was twelve meters long, and there were four large pillars with a diameter of about half a meter in the middle. Its location was in the center of the residential area. We speculate that it may have been the residence of the tribal chief or a place where clan members gathered for meetings and discussions. The structure of the square house is simple. Most of them first dig a square pit with rounded corners about one meter or half a meter deep on the ground, and then smear a layer of grass-mixed mud on the pit wall to be used as the wall. The thickness of this layer of grass mud is from two centimeters to one decimeter. The roof is erected from the original ground around the pit with wooden rafters. The wooden rafters are then covered with a thick layer of grass mud about one decimeter to two decimeters. One to four wooden pillars in the middle of the house support the roof. The entrance for people to enter and exit is a narrow passage that can only accommodate one person. Some are slopes, and some are steps. Daily necessities are scattered in every corner of the house. We have discovered a total of twelve such houses, and they are well preserved.
    Round houses are also divided into two categories: one is perfectly round, and the other is oval. The perfectly round ones are more numerous. The structure of this type of house is more complex than that of the square houses. Some are like square houses, also digging a pit and then smearing the walls with mud, but there are wooden pillars around to support the walls. Most of them are built on the ground. The walls are made of wooden pillars as the skeleton, and the two sides are smeared with mud. The walls are on average about two decimeters thick. The wooden pillar skeletons are arranged very densely. An average round house with a diameter of five meters requires more than sixty or seventy wooden pillars. Some of these wooden skeletons are thin wooden sticks, and some are thick pieces of wood that are split into various shapes to be used as wooden boards. The roof is arranged with wooden rafters as closely as square houses. The top is also covered with a very thick layer of grass mud. The place where the roof and the wooden walls are connected is tied with rattan or straw ropes. The doorway is relatively open and flat, not as narrow as the square houses. The pillars supporting the roof are as few as two and as many as six, mostly standing in the middle of the house or on both sides of the stove pit. Restoring this type of house makes it look very much like a "Mongolian yurt." A total of twenty-eight such houses have been discovered, most of which are broken.
    Near the houses, there is always one or several cellars for storing things. Their use is the same as our warehouses or storage rooms today. They are places for placing things; they can hold utensils or store food; they are generally round bag-shaped pits with a small mouth and a large bottom. The diameter of the large bottom is about two meters, and the diameter of the small bottom is less than one meter. The difference between the diameter of the mouth and the diameter of the bottom is often more than double, so it is made into this shape, perhaps for the sake of protecting it more conveniently on top.
    Inside the houses, in the cellars, or on the nearby garbage piles, a large number of utensils used in their daily lives were found. Most of these utensils are pottery, totaling forty or fifty different styles. The ones that we can name are urns, basins, bowls, jars, pots, tripods, cups, dishes, basins, pointed-bottom bottles, and other various jars, as well as some artifacts that cannot be named. If we carefully analyze so many utensils, we will understand that they are made of different materials and adapted to the corresponding shapes according to special uses. For example, urns and jars with a large mouth and a small bottom are mainly used as cooking utensils, either for cooking rice or boiling water, so they are made of coarse sandy pottery that is relatively fire-resistant; basins and bowls are probably used for holding water or placing food, so they are made of fine mud. Not only is there no sand mixed inside, but the surface is polished very smoothly, and some are also painted with patterns to decorate it; pointed-bottom bottles may be for drawing water, because they are used frequently and are easily broken, so the pottery soil used to make them is also particularly hard. In addition to pottery, there are bone daggers and some small stone tools.
    When we are in the middle of these houses, facing these red-hot stove pits, with animal bones and charcoal piled up next to them, and fruit pits and snail shells scattered near the broken pottery, it is as if we are personally seeing the living scenes of our ancestors in this environment; they are sitting around the blazing fire, roasting the meat of hunted beasts, or swallowing ground grain flour, and some are even chewing on the wild fruits they have gathered with relish. Perhaps the mother is breastfeeding the hungry child, and the elders are endlessly teaching the young lads the simple production techniques they have accumulated in their lives.
    Above, I have described what our ancestors ate, lived in, and used. Now, let's take a look at the clothes they wore and what they used to make decorations. We have not found direct evidence of clothing, but it can be asserted that it was no problem for people to wear clothes regularly at that time. The skins of hunted wild animals could naturally be made into clothes to resist the cold, and cloth woven from plant fibers such as wild hemp could also be used as clothes. It is certain that there was textile at that time. Many pottery and stone spindle whorls were found at the site. In addition, various different thread patterns and imprints of coarse cloth were left on the surface of the pottery, as well as dozens of exquisite bone needles with small eyes. These can be used as evidence for sewing clothes, because even now, some backward civilizations still use this material and tools to make clothes, and our ancestors may have been in a similar situation.
    People always love beauty. Although the environment in which our ancestors lived was so difficult, they still did not forget to decorate themselves. We have found a lot of decorations, the most common of which are pottery rings, and there are also stone rings, which are all worn on the body. Two jade earrings with small holes were found. In the tomb of a child, dozens of small stone beads were strung together around his waist. Sometimes, perforated shells, drilled animal teeth, or various shell pieces ground into various shapes were worn on the body to beautify themselves. Some of these decorations are very exquisitely made.
    Manufacturing of Tools and Utensils and Art
    I would like to talk about how the production tools and daily necessities used by our ancestors mentioned above were manufactured, because the technology for manufacturing tools marks the level of productive forces development. Our ancestors were already in the developed Neolithic Age, and the technology for manufacturing tools and utensils had reached a fairly high level. The stone tool manufacturing was mainly manifested in the polishing technology. This is the most advanced method of stone-making technology. Large tools such as axes, adzes, and chisels have undergone a series of procedures of striking and polishing or hammering and polishing. The manufactured appliances can be said to be handy and in line with the actual purpose of use. In addition to polished stone tools, the more primitive struck stone tools still exist, but the technology is less advanced than before. Often, a piece is struck from a natural pebble and slightly modified to be used as a knife or a knocker. In most cases, the manufacture of bone tools adopts the method of shaving and grinding; the bone material is cut or knocked into strips or flakes of the initial shape, and then finely ground. Most of the grinding is done on the practical parts, such as the tip of the shovel and the blade of the awl, and some are completely polished like needles. There are also those that utilize the natural shape of the bones. However, there are also manufacturing techniques, such as the small needles for sewing clothes with small holes, which we can only admire its ingenuity when we see it, but we still cannot know what tools were used to make it and how it was made.
    The most representative of the technological level at that time was pottery making. There was no potter's wheel at that time, and the utensils were all made by hand. The most common method is the coiling method, that is, using mud strips to coil up layer by layer to create an artistic form, and then trim the inside and outside. Large utensils are sometimes standardized with molds, and small ones can be done by hand. Fine mud utensils are also polished on the surface, and they are very smooth after firing. The rough pottery jars often have traces of rope imprints on the outside, which are the traces of the beating during manufacturing and are also a primitive form of decoration. Red is the most common color, which is related to its manufacturing method. Due to the relationship of the firing temperature, various mixed colors such as gray, brown, and black also appear.
    The high skill of pottery making is colored pottery, which is one of the characteristics of the "Yangshao Culture"; no matter from the exquisite shape and the vivid and realistic painting, it can show the creative artistic genius of our ancestors. Most of the colored utensils are red, and the color is black or purple. They are painted on the outside of bowls and pots or inside the basins. Among the patterns, geometric patterns such as triangles, strips, and squares are the most common; the more prominent are the images of animals such as fish, deer, and human faces. These images are very realistic, from which it can be seen that our ancestors were able to deeply observe the internal characteristics of things, grasp the characteristics and express their images without losing the original shape. Moreover, in terms of material selection, it was not blindly imagined out of thin air, but taken from the surrounding natural world and the things closely related to their lives, which fully demonstrated the realistic significance of simple primitive art.
    The kiln sites for manufacturing these pottery wares are close to the east of the residential area. There are two types of kilns for firing pottery: one is a straight kiln, one end of the cylinder is the kiln mouth, which is the place for adding firewood and burning fire; the other end is the kiln chamber, which is the part for placing pottery. The kiln chamber is a circular plane, with small rectangular fire eyes around it. Flames enter the kiln chamber from these small fire eyes. This kiln is very small, and the diameter of the kiln chamber is only 0.8 meters. Ordinary pottery can be fired in five or six pieces, and the large ones are only one or two. The other type of kiln is larger, and its shape is also different from the former. Its structure is: the bottom is a bag-shaped pit-like furnace, and the kiln chamber is above the furnace, with several large fire eyes in the middle that penetrate each other. These kilns for firing pottery are of great help to us in understanding the pottery-making technology at that time. Their scale is small and their structure is simple, but the scientific principles applied are no different from the most advanced pottery kilns today.
    Burial System and Customs
    The above describes everything about our ancestors when they were alive. Here, I will briefly talk about the system and customs of burying the dead. At that time, great attention was already paid to the burial of the dead; adults and children were treated in different ways.
    After a child died, they were buried next to the house. The method of burial was to dig a pit, put a large coarse pottery urn, put the child's body inside, and then cover it with a fine mud pottery bowl or basin. This kind of urn burial for children was often buried together in several or dozens of pieces. In total, we discovered more than fifty urn coffins, most of which did not have burial objects. Why did people at that time bury the bodies of children next to the house? I think it may have been to prevent harm from wild animals, showing their concern for children.
    After an adult died, they were buried in the public cemetery of the commune. This cemetery is located in the north of the residential area, and the burial has a certain system. Most of them are buried with their heads to the west, facing upwards, with their limbs stretched straight, which is the same as the burial situation today. The positions of the tombs are arranged very neatly, and they are in rows and columns in the east-west or north-south direction. Most of the tombs are dug into rectangular pits. The burial tools are no longer clear, and only one place has traces of primitive coffins with wooden boards inserted around the body, but there is no lid or bottom. The burial objects are all utensils commonly used in daily life, mainly pottery, and also decorations, but there are no production tools at all. This may be because production tools were more valuable and belonged to the commune, and could not be taken away by private individuals. The burial objects were placed at the feet or pressed on the lower limbs, and their number ranged from one to ten. Decorations were mostly on the head or waist. The millet of the grain buried for the deceased was also preserved in a pottery bowl in a tomb. The vast majority of these tombs are buried with one person in one place, of which only one place each of two-person joint burial and four-person joint burial were found. In addition, there is a burial custom - the secondary burial system, that is, after a person dies, the body is placed in one place, and after the flesh decays, the bones are collected and buried together. There are only six such burials. There is also a custom of prone burial, that is, when burying people, the body is placed in a crawling position, facing the ground. There are fifteen places belonging to this category. The latter two types of burials have no burial objects.
    The religious consciousness of the people at that time can also be reflected by the burial customs. The concern for people after death and the burial rituals indicate that life after death is the same as life before death. The things they used are placed in the tomb, and even the limited grain obtained from hard work is given to the dead, so that they will not be hungry and live safely after death, just like before death.
    The living conditions of our ancestors in the Banpo Neolithic Age were roughly like this.
    The rich gains from the excavation of the Banpo Neolithic cultural site not only enable us to understand the living conditions of our ancestors in the primitive clan commune era, but also powerfully refute the fallacies fabricated by imperialist elements that our country has no ancient culture. In order to better preserve this ancient cultural site with special historical value, the Party and the government have decided to establish the first site museum in our country here. In addition to building a special exhibition hall to display all the cultural relics excavated, a large site hall will also be built on the exposed site to protect the main building foundation sites in their original state. The construction project will be completed next year. People who come to Xi'an in the future can see the living scenes of our ancestors in the primitive clan society era. (Attached pictures)

    我们祖先在原始氏族社会时代的生活情景
    ——西安半坡遗址发掘的主要收获—— 　 石兴邦
    历史学家根据传说和文献的考证，认为在远古时代，我们祖先活动的主要地区是在黄河流域的中原地区和西北一带。的确，在今日河南、陕西、山西和甘肃等省的河流两岸的台地上，发现了许多新石器时代文化遗址。其中数量最多而分布最广的，我们称为“仰韶文化”遗址，因为属于这一文化系统的东西，最初是在河南渑池县仰韶村发现的。
    “仰韶文化”遗址，是四、五千年以前我们祖先遗留下来的最珍贵的文化宝库。每一个遗址，我们都可把它当作是保存我们祖先在原始氏族社会时代的一个完备的博物馆，只要把它发掘出来，就能够看到他们那时一幅比较完整的生活图景。同时，它们也是研究我们祖先当时生活状况的一个好的图书馆，只要把它揭开，就可以了解：我们祖先是怎样生活的，他们如何与自然界作斗争来取得自己必需的生活资料，他们用什么工具从事劳动生产，他们住什么房子、吃什么食物、穿什么衣服，他们过怎样的社会生活，他们的生活习俗、思想意识和宗教信仰又是怎样的。所有这些，过去我们仅仅从渺茫的神话传说中，或者是穿凿附会的文献纪录里，才能窥见一点影子。可是，现在在我们人民考古事业的迅速发展的情况下，在我们对这些古文化遗址的考古研究的发掘工作中，就能够亲眼看到那时我们祖先生活的真实情景了。
    在这许多地下博物馆和原始图书馆中的一个——西安半坡仰韶文化遗址——被我们在最近两年来把它发掘出来了。虽然我们所发掘的范围还不到全部面积的二分之一，但是所发现出来的当时人们所遗留下来的物质文化遗存是很丰富的，它能够帮助我们来说明我们祖先在那时生活的一般情况。
    以农业为主的经济生活
    半坡遗址的自然环境是很幽美的，后面靠的是历史上有名的坝陵原，前面紧临长安八水之一的浐河，中间是一块肥沃的河谷台地，遗址就是在这个台地的中心。我们祖先就选择了这样一片肥美的土地，定居下来经营他们氏族的共同生活。在氏族领土的范围内，居住的地方是在遗址的中心，东边是烧制陶器的窑址，北边是埋葬死者的公共墓地，在墓地和居住区之间，隔了一条沟渠。这样的划分地区，正可以说明原始氏族社会的一般特征。
    当时，我们祖先的生活，主要是依靠从事农业生产活动来维持的。他们所使用的劳动生产工具有石斧、石锛、石刀、陶刀、骨锯、骨锄和其他一些打制的粗糙的石制工具，可能还用木制的掘土棒一类的东西。他们就是利用这些原始的简陋的工具，在附近的河谷台地上，砍伐树木，翻耕土地，播种谷物，收割庄稼。他们所种植的粮食，我们所知道的是今日华北一带所常见的谷子（粟）。1954年秋季，在一个房子下面的一个小坑中，发现了盛有谷子的陶罐子，盛在罐子里的谷子虽然腐朽了，可是它的皮壳一粒一粒看起来还很清楚。还有去年在七号方形房子里面的一个地窖中，也发现了一堆粮食壳皮。如果没有相当发达的农业，那是不会有这种遗迹的。定居生活是农业生产发展的必然现象，是农业生产发展的一个重要的证明。农业生产的发展，使我们祖先比较长期地在这里生活下去。从丰富的厚达四、五公尺深的文化堆积层，就可以说明这个事实。不过，从当时生产力发展的水平来说，农业还在锄掘农业的阶段。由于应付自然灾害的软弱无力，仅仅凭这种原始形态的农业生产并不能保证他们的生活就无忧无虑。因此，除了农耕而外，祖先们还从事于畜养家畜、打猎、捕鱼和采集野生果实等种种辅助的生产活动，来弥补他们生活资料的不足。
    那时饲养的家畜，我们知道的有狗和猪，打猎的主要对象是鹿，打猎的工具大部分是用弓箭和标枪，箭头大多数是用骨头作的，这些箭头，不仅样式多，而且做的精巧，非常锋利。枪头有骨的，也有石的。在原始时代，武器和工具在功用上是没有多大区别的，所以石斧、木棒也常常作为猎具来用。捕鱼在当时似乎相当发达了。我们发现了许多骨制的鱼钩、鱼叉和用石片作成的网坠。其中最突出的是钓鱼钩，虽则是用骨头作的，但制工之巧，形式之美，和我们今日用钢丝作成的可以比美。还有，在彩色陶器里面也多绘有鱼形花纹，而且很逼真。凡此种种，都可以说明捕鱼在当时生活上是占有一定重要的地位。采集经济尽管在当时处于次要地位，但是仍然是存在的；我们在灰土中、房子周围或火炉的旁边，常常找到他们食余的果核。总之，在那个时候，凡是周围自然界所有的，人们力量可以作到的，能够作为食料的一切东西，我们祖先就把它取来充实自己的生活。
    最能够体现当时生活状况的是居住的房子。我们祖先在那时居住着两种不同型式的房子，一种是圆的，一种是方的；圆形的比方形的多，建筑的技术也比较进步。不管是圆的或是方的，它们的共同特点是：房子门都是向南开着，一进门两边是很低的两道隔墙，房子中间是一个烧火的灶坑，这和今日许多兄弟民族的习惯一样。这些房子，往往几个上下压在一起，这可以说明在这里居住时间的久暂和前后演变的情况。现在，让我们看看各种房子的构造和特点。
    方形房子有正方形和长方形两类，形状是方的或者是长方的，四角则是圆的，面积普通在十六到三十六平方公尺左右，只有1954年发现的一个方房子比较大，保存较好的一边长达十二公尺，中间有四个直径约半米的大柱子，它的位置在居住区的中心。我们推测，它很可能是部落酋长的住宅，或者是氏族成员共同集会议事的场所。方形房子的构造简单，最多的是先在地面上挖一个深约一公尺或半公尺的圆角方坑，在坑壁上涂抹一层草拌泥土就当墙壁来用，这层草泥土厚由二厘米至一分米不等，屋顶是沿坑的周围从原来地面用木椽架起来的，木椽上面再涂厚约一分米至二分米的草泥土，房子中间有一个至四个木柱撑持屋顶。人们出入的门户，是仅仅能容一人通过的窄道，有的是斜坡，有些是台阶；日常使用的东西，则散布在房子的各个角落里。这种房子，我们共发现了十二个，保存得还好。
    圆形的房子也有两类，一类是成正圆的，一类则是呈椭圆形的，正圆形较多，这种房子的构造比方形房子复杂。有些和方形房子一样，也挖一个坑，再用泥土涂抹墙壁，但周围有木柱来支持墙壁。多数是平地建筑起来的，墙壁是用木柱作骨干，两边涂抹泥土，墙壁平均厚二分米左右，木柱骨干排列得很密集，平均直径五公尺的一个圆形房子，要用六、七十根以上的木柱子。这些木头骨干，有些是细的木棍子，有些是粗的木头劈成各种形状的木板子来用的。屋顶和方形房子一样，是用木椽紧密地排列起来的。上面也是涂一层很厚的草泥土，屋顶与墙壁木头相接的地方是用藤条或草绳一类的东西所缠扎起来的。门口比较开阔平坦，没有方形房子那样狭窄。撑持屋顶的柱子，少至两根，多到六根，多立在房子中间或灶坑的两旁。这种房子把它复原起来，非常像“蒙古包”的样子。这种房子共发现了二十八个，大部分都破碎了。
    在房子的附近，总有一个或数个贮藏东西的地窖，它们的用途和我们今日的仓库或贮藏室一样，是放置东西的处所；可以放器皿，也可以藏食物；一般都是口小底大的圆形袋状坑，大的底径约二公尺左右，小的不到一公尺，口径和底径之差往往相差一倍以上，所以作成这个样子，也许是为了在上面保护起来比较方便。
    在房子里面、地窖中或是附近的垃圾堆上，发现了大量的他们在日常生活方面所用的器皿，这些器皿大多数是陶器，总计起来，有四、五十种不同的样式。我们能叫出名称来的有瓮、盆、钵、碗、壶、鼎、杯、皿、盂、尖底瓶，以及其他各式各样的罐子，此外还有无法命名的一些器物。我们把这样多的器皿，仔细地分析一下，就明白了他们是根据特殊的用途而用不同的质料造成与之相适应的形状的。例如，大口小底的瓮和罐，主要是用作炊器，不是煮饭就是烧水，因此是用比较耐火的粗砂陶来作的；盆、钵一类的器皿，大概是用以盛水或放置食物的，就用细泥来作，不但里面不夹砂，而且表面打磨得很光滑，有些上面还绘有纹彩来装饰它；尖底瓶这种器物，可能是汲水的，因为它用的次数多，容易碰破，所以用以制造的陶土也是特别坚硬。除陶器外，还有骨制的匕和石制的一些小型工具。
    当我们置身于这些房子中间，面对着这些烧红的灶坑、旁边堆积的兽骨和木炭，在破碎的陶器附近散布着食余的果核和螺壳，就好像亲眼看到我们祖先在这种境界中的生活情景了；他们围坐在生着烈火的火炉旁边，烧烤着猎获的兽肉，或者吞食着磨碎的谷粉，有些人还津津有味地咀嚼着采来的野果，也许母亲正在为饥饿的孩子哺乳，老人们滔滔不绝地向年轻小伙子传授他们一生累积起来的简单的生产技术。
    上面我已经叙述了我们祖先吃的、住的和使用的东西，现在再来看一看他们穿的衣服和用什么来做装饰品。我们没有发现衣服的直接证据，但可断言，那时的人们经常穿衣服是不成问题了。猎获野兽的皮自然可以作成衣服来抵御寒冷，采用野麻一类的植物纤维织成的布也可以作为衣服来穿的。当时有了纺织是肯定的，在遗址里面发现了许多陶制的和石制的纺线锤，另外在陶器的表面上还留有各种不同的线纹和粗布的印迹，还有数十枚精巧的穿有小眼的骨针。这些都可以作为缝制衣服的证据，因为直至现在，有些后进文明的部族，仍然是用这种材料和工具来做衣服的，我们祖先可能和他们的情形相似。
    人总是爱美的。祖先们虽然所处环境是那样的艰苦，他们还忘不了装饰自己。我们发现了很多的装饰品，最多的是陶环，石环也有，这些都是佩在身上的。玉石作的穿有小孔的耳坠子发现了两个，在一个小孩的墓中有数十粒小的石珠子贯穿起来围绕在他的腰里，有时还用穿了孔的介壳、钻了眼的兽牙或磨成各式各样的蚌片佩挂在身上来美化自己。这些装饰品有些制作得很精美。
    工具用具的制造和艺术
    我想再来谈谈上面提到的我们祖先所使用的生产工具和生活用具是怎样制造的，因为对于工具制造的技艺标志着生产力发展的水平。我们祖先当时已经处在发达的新石器时代，制造工具和用具的技术已经达到相当高的水平，在石器制造上主要表现为磨光的技术，这是制石工艺最进步的方法，如大型的斧、锛、凿等工具都经过了打制磨光或捶琢磨光的一系列手续，制造出来的器具，可说得心应手，合于实际使用的目的。除磨光的石器外，比较原始的打制的石制石工艺还是存在的，不过在技术上较前退步了，往往是从一块自然的河卵石上打下一片稍加修饰即作为刀子或敲砸器来用的。骨器的制造在大多数的场合下，是采用削磨的方法；将骨料截成或敲砸成条状的或片状的初形，然后加以细磨，磨的多半是实用的部分，如铲子的尖和锥子的刃，也有通体磨光的像针。也有按照骨头的自然形状加以利用的。可是还有的制造技术，如缝衣服的细小的带有小孔的针，我们见了只赞叹它的巧妙，但是用什么工具作成的和怎样作成的，现在还是无法知道。
    最能代表当时工艺水平的是制陶术。那时还没有陶轮，器物都是用手来作的，最普通的作法是盘条法，就是用泥条一层一层地盘起来，作成艺术的形式，然后内外面加以修整。大型的器物有时用模子来规范，小型的用手就行了。细泥作的器物，表面还加以打磨，烧成后很光滑。粗糙的陶罐，外表常常有绳子拍印的痕迹，这是制造时所拍打的遗迹，也是一种原始的装饰。颜色以红色最多，这和它的制造方法有关，由于火候的关系，还呈现出了灰、褐、黑等各种互相混合的颜色。
    制陶术的高度技艺是彩色陶器，这是“仰韶文化”的特点之一；不论从造形的精美和彩绘的生动逼真，都可以表现出我们祖先创造性的艺术天才。有彩的器物多是红色，彩是黑的或紫色的，绘在钵、壶的外表或盆子的里面，花纹中以三角、条形和方格的几何形花纹为最多；比较突出的是动物如鱼、鹿、人面形等等的形象，这些形象都很真实，由此可以看出，我们祖先已经能够深入地观察事物内部的特质，抓住特点而不失原形地表现它们的形象。而且在取材方面，也不是盲无目的地凭空想出来的，而是从周围自然界与他们生活相密切联系的事物中所摄取的，这就十足地表现出了朴实的原始艺术的现实意义。
    制造这些陶器的窑址，紧靠在居住区的东边。烧陶器的窑有两种样子，一种是直筒窑，筒子的一端是窑口，是加薪烧火的地方；另一端是窑室，是放置陶器的部分。窑室是一个圆形的平面，四周有长方形的小火眼，火焰从这些小火眼中进入窑室。这种窑很小，窑室直径不过零点八公尺，一般的陶器可以烧五、六个，大的也不过一两个而已。另一种窑比较大，形状也和前者不同，它的构造是：下面是袋状坑样子的火炉，窑室在火炉的上面，中间有几个大的火眼，互相穿通。这些烧陶器的窑对我们了解当时制陶工艺上有很大的帮助。它们的规模是小的，结构也简单，可是应用的科学原理和今日最进步的陶窑也没有什么不同。
    埋葬的制度和习俗
    以上所叙述的是我们祖先活在世上的时候的一切情况，这里再来简要地把埋葬死人的制度和习俗说一说。那时，对人死后的埋葬，已经很注意了；对成年人和小孩子，是采取不同的方式来处理的。
    小孩子死了后，都埋在房子的旁边，埋葬的方法是将地挖一个坑，放一个大的粗陶瓮，把孩子的尸体放在里面，然后上面再盖一个细泥作的陶钵或陶盆。这种埋小孩的瓮棺葬，往往数个或数十个埋在一起，总共我们发现了五十多个瓮棺，里面大部分没有随葬的东西。为什么当时人要把孩子的尸体埋在房子的旁边呢？我想可能是为了防止野兽的伤害，表现出了他们对孩子的关心。
    成年人死了后，埋葬在公社的公共墓地里。这个墓地，位在居住区的北边，埋葬有一定的制度，最多是头向西，面向上，四肢伸直，和我们今日的埋人情形一样。墓坑的位置排列得很整齐，东西或南北都是成行成列的。墓坑多是挖一个长方坑，葬具已经看不清楚，只发现一处有用木板插在尸体周围的原始的棺材痕迹，但没有盖，也没有底。随葬的东西，都是日常生活上所常用的器皿，主要是陶器，也有装饰品，但完全没有生产工具，这可能是因为生产工具比较贵重且归公社所有，不能给私人带去。随葬的器物，都放在脚下或压在下肢上面，它们的数目由一个至十个不等，装饰品多在头部或腰间。在一个墓的陶钵里面还保留给死者埋葬的粮食的谷子。这些墓绝大多数是一个人葬在一处，其中只发现了二人合葬，四人合葬的各一处。此外，还有一种葬俗——二次埋葬制，就是人死后，将尸体放在一处，肉体腐烂后，再将骨头收拢起来埋在一起，这种葬法只有六个。还有一种俯身葬的习俗，是埋人时将尸体放置作爬伏状，面向地下，属于这一类的有十五处。后面这两种葬法都没有随葬品。
    由埋葬的习俗，也可以反映出当时人们的宗教意识。对人死后的关怀和埋葬的仪式，表示人死后和生前一样的生活，将他们所用的东西，放在墓里，甚至把辛勤劳动所获得的有限的粮食也给了死人，好让他们在死后和生前一样不受饥饿，安然无恙地生活下去。
    在半坡新石器时代，我们祖先的生活状况，大致就是这样。
    半坡新石器时代文化遗址发掘的丰富收获，不但使我们能够了解我们祖先在原始氏族公社时代的生活情景，而且有力地驳斥了帝国主义分子所捏造的我国没有远古文化的谬论。党和政府为了更好地保存这一具有特殊历史价值的古文化遗址，已经决定在这里成立我国第一个遗址博物馆，除建筑专门的陈列室陈列所发掘出的一切文化遗物外，还在揭露出来的遗址上面，修一个大的遗址馆，将主要的房屋建筑基址原封不动地保护起来。建馆工程将在明年完成。以后到西安的人都可以看到我们祖先在原始氏族社会时代的生活情景。（附图片）
