Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 27th:

    Gomulka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, spoke with Hank, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Polish Coal Miners' Union, on the 25th, answering some of the questions raised by Hank.

    Gomulka said that the coal mining industry is a fundamental sector of Poland's industry and has a decisive significance for the national economy. The failure to complete the coal mining plans last year and this year has added many difficulties to the national economy. The reduction in coal exports has also increased the trade deficit. At the same time, domestic demand for coal is also increasing, and even with reduced coal exports, domestic needs cannot be fully met, especially in winter. He said that this problem can only be solved by the miners.

    Gomulka said that the Party and the government are well aware of the working and living conditions of the miners, and this was also discussed at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee. He fully agreed with the union's opinion that the wages of coal miners should generally be higher than those in other industrial sectors. He agreed to meet all the legitimate demands of the miners.

    Gomulka also pointed out that if production is not increased and only wages are unilaterally raised, there is a danger of inflation. He said that the wages of coal miners will inevitably be raised, and while raising wages, this should be explained to the working class, and coal miners should be called upon to help the people's government and the people of the country increase coal production. He also pointed out that it will take some time to further increase wages. The future is bright, but this is not a matter of a day or two. He said, "We ask the workers to give us the time necessary to realize our intentions."

    Regarding the issue of abolishing Sunday work, Gomulka pointed out that the Party and the government fully understand that it is wrong to make workers work on Sundays, and it is also legitimate for workers to demand the abolition of this. He said that the plan for 1957, which was formulated some time ago, still stipulated that mines had to work twelve Sundays. He said that he would submit this issue to the Party's leadership for discussion. He hoped that coal miners could compensate for the reduced coal production due to the abolition of Sunday work by eliminating absenteeism and improving labor organization during normal working days.

    Gomulka particularly pointed out that Polish coal miners have more than once helped the people's government and the people of the country overcome difficulties with their patriotic selfless labor. He believed that if the country needed the miners to work a few more Sundays in 1957, the miners would not refuse.

    Gomulka also spoke about the issue of worker autonomy. He believes that this is an important measure to improve the management of socialist enterprises. However, he asked the workers to be cautious and to rely on practical experience to formulate specific forms, organizations, and specific working methods for worker autonomy. He called on the miners to pay attention to discipline in their work and respect the instructions of administrative management personnel.

    哥穆尔卡谈煤矿工人的问题
    据新华社华沙27日电　波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡在25日同波兰煤矿工人工会执行委员会主席汉克谈话，答复了汉克提出的一些问题。
    哥穆尔卡说，煤矿工业是波兰的基本工业部门，对全国经济有着决定性的意义。由于去年和今年的采煤计划没有完成，就使国民经济增加了许多困难。由于煤的出口减少，也就使对外贸易增加了入超。同时国内煤的需求量也在增加着，尽管减少煤的出口量，还是不能完全满足国内需要，特别是在冬季。他说，这个问题只能由矿工来解决。
    哥穆尔卡说，党和政府很了解矿工们的工作和生活条件，在党的八中全会上也曾讨论过这一点。他完全同意工会的意见，煤矿工人的工资一般应高于其他工业部门。他同意满足矿工的一切正当的要求。
    哥穆尔卡同时也指出，如果不提高生产而只是单方面地提高工资，就有通货膨胀的危险。他说，煤矿工人的工资必将提高，在提高工资的同时应当向工人阶级说明这一点，号召煤矿工人帮助人民政权和全国人民增加煤的产量。他还指出，要经过一定时间才能更多提高工资。前景是美好的。但是这不是一朝一夕的事。他说，“我们请工人们给我们以必需的时间来实现我们的意图。”
    在谈到取消星期日工作制的问题时，哥穆尔卡指出，党和政府完全明白使工人在星期日工作是不对的，工人要求取消这一点也是正当的。他说，前些时制定的1957年的计划中，还规定矿上有十二个星期日要工作。他说，他将把这个问题提交党的领导机关讨论。他希望煤矿工人能够在正常的工作日用消除缺勤、改善劳动组织等方法来补救因取消星期日工作而减少的采煤量。
    哥穆尔卡特别指出波兰煤矿工人过去曾经不止一次用爱国的忘我劳动来帮助人民政权和全国人民克服困难。他相信，假如国家需要矿工们在1957年再工作几个星期日的话，矿工们是不会拒绝的。
    哥穆尔卡还谈到了工人自治的问题。他认为这是改善社会主义企业经营的重要的措施。但是，他请工人们要慎重，要靠实践中的经验来制定具体的工人自治的形式、组织和具体工作方法。他号召矿工们在工作中注意纪律性，尊重行政管理人员的指示。
