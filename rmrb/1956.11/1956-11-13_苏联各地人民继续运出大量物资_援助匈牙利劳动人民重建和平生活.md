Xinhua News Agency, 12th: TASS reports: People from all parts of the Soviet Union continue to transport materials to assist the Hungarian working people.

    In the city of Lviv, near the Hungarian border, workers are launching a labor upsurge to help their Hungarian worker brothers. The employees of the "Red Sugar Factory" have been processing several thousand quintals of raw materials beyond their plan every day for the past few days. They once loaded an entire train of sugar for the Hungarian working people in just over a day. The workers of the Khodorov factory have also shipped 3,000 tons of sugar. On the 11th, the working people of Lviv also shipped a refrigerated train of fresh meat.

    Railway employees in Lviv have also been working particularly hard these days. An increasing amount of supplies are being transported to Hungary through this area from regions such as Stalino and Kharkov. In the past two days, this trunk line has transported more than 2,000 carloads of food and building materials to Hungary. Railway employees have specially organized the dispatching management of these trains so that they can run at high speed.

    In the Uzhgorod section, railway workers have also organized the rapid transfer of goods from Soviet cars to Hungarian cars. In addition, many new machines have been used to keep the transfer work going day and night.

    Rafters in Cherepovets, in the north of the Soviet Union, have also shipped forty-seven carloads of timber to the Hungarian working people.

    Now, they are preparing to cooperate with the railway workers to ship the remaining seventy-three carloads of timber ahead of schedule.

    苏联各地人民继续运出大量物资
    援助匈牙利劳动人民重建和平生活
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联各地人民继续运出物资，接济匈牙利劳动人民。
    在接近匈牙利边境的利沃夫城，工人为了援助匈牙利工人弟兄，正掀起了劳动热潮。“红色制糖厂”的职工这几天每天都要超计划地加工几千公担的原料。他们曾经用一昼夜多一点的时间装载了整列车的糖运给匈牙利劳动人民。霍多罗夫工厂的职工也已经运出了三千吨糖。利沃夫劳动人民还在11日运出一列冷藏火车的鲜肉。
    利沃夫铁路员工这几天也特别紧张地劳动着。从斯大林诺、哈尔科夫等地区运往匈牙利途经这里的物资越来越多。最近两天，这条干线已经为匈牙利运去二千多车皮的食品和建筑材料。铁路员工特地对这些列车的运转组织了调度管理，使它们都能以高速运行。
    在乌兹哥罗德段，铁路职工还组织了从苏联的车皮把物资迅速转装到匈牙利的车皮的工作。此外，还运用了许多新机器，使转运工作日夜不停地进行。
    远在苏联北部的切列波维次的筏运工人也给匈牙利劳动人民运去了四十七车皮的木料。
    现在，他们正准备同铁路工人合作，提前运出其余一批七十三车皮的木料。
