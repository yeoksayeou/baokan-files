Visiting Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Cenotaph
    Ma Gongyu
        In the ancient temple, I paid homage to the great man in autumn,
        Events of forty years ago are still truly remembered.
        His heroic spirit underground must be smiling,
        Today's China is being renewed daily.
    This is one of the quatrains I wrote when visiting Dr. Sun Yat-sen's cenotaph at the Temple of Azure Clouds in the Western Hills. The high and clear autumn sky is the best time of year in Beijing. On a windless, cloudless, neither cold nor warm morning, I took a car from the eastern city all the way to the foot of the Western Hills. The Western Hills are a place I visited decades ago, and their appearance is very different now than it was then. After liberation, through the renovation and construction by the People's Government, closing off mountains for afforestation, and various measures, the Western Hills, like other scenic areas, have changed from a state of decline and desolation to a fresh and vibrant atmosphere. Although it is already late autumn, the mountains are lush and green, no different from spring and summer. I ascended to the Temple of Azure Clouds, and in the solemn Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, I viewed various memorabilia and the crystal coffin donated by the Soviet Union, and then walked to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's cenotaph and gave the highest salute. At this time, I couldn't help but recall the old events of more than forty years ago.

    In 1909, I was still studying in Hangzhou. One day, I received propaganda from students studying in Japan in Tokyo, which read: "Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocates revolution... All descendants of the Yellow Emperor, those with vigor and blood, should rise up..." After reading it, my classmates and I were very moved. We secretly hid the propaganda to avoid causing trouble, and discussed with our classmates how to respond to Mr. Sun's revolution. I proposed that we cut off our queues first to show our disobedience to the Qing system. Chen Junyang, Chen Shuping, Dong Zhongguang, Chen Zhongtao, Liu Fuzhong... and other classmates in the same dormitory all agreed, and all cut off their queues overnight. Although this matter was small, it caused inconvenience. At that time, the Qing court strictly guarded against revolution, and officials often took the opportunity to capture revolutionaries to gain merit and be promoted. If we who cut off our queues were suspected of being revolutionaries and taken to the yamen, what would we do? So, when returning to our hometown during the winter vacation, we still put a small queue in our caps.

    In 1912, I had already graduated and was still in Hangzhou. One day, I saw a large poster on the street, knowing that Mr. Sun was going to give a speech at the Mapo Lane School of Law and Politics. I was extremely happy. As soon as the time came, I rushed into the venue and sat in the first row. His passionate and inspiring speech moved people deeply. After listening to the speech, a Mr. Shen took me and two young people named He and Yan to the lounge to see Mr. Sun. He asked us a few questions and encouraged us a few words. Although the time was very short, his enthusiasm for caring for young people could be fully expressed in his attitude and words. This impression was deeply engraved in my mind and will never disappear. Since then, I hurried back to my hometown and devoted myself to education and literary work, and had no chance to see Dr. Sun Yat-sen again.

    This year is the ninetieth anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. At this time, I have the opportunity to visit Mr. Sun's cenotaph, and I can't help but have great feelings in my heart. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was a great pioneer of the democratic revolution, who devoted his life to the revolutionary cause, but his ideals had not been realized in the past, and only today have they been realized. Today's China has become an independent, free, and happy country, with endless beautiful scenery ahead. If Dr. Sun Yat-sen knew in death, he would be so happy!

    谒中山先生衣冠冢
    马公愚
        古寺乘秋礼伟人，
        卌年前事记犹真。
        英灵地下应含笑，
        今日神州正日新。
    这是我在西山碧云寺谒孙中山先生衣冠冢时所作的绝句之一。天高气爽的秋季，是北京一年中最好的时候，在一个无风无云不寒不暖的早晨，我从东城坐车直到西山脚下。西山是我数十年前游过的地方，现在的面貌与从前大不相同了。解放以后，经人民政府修整兴建，封山育林，种种措施，西山也和其他风景区一样，改变了衰老荒凉的状态，出现了新鲜蓬勃的气象，虽然已是深秋，而满山葱翠，不异春夏。我登上碧云寺，在庄严的中山纪念堂里，瞻览了各种纪念品和苏联赠送的水晶棺材之后，便走到中山先生衣冠冢前，行一个最敬礼。在这时候，不禁回忆起四十几年前的旧事了。
    1909年，我还在杭州念书，一天接到留日学生从东京寄来的宣传品，内容有：“孙逸仙先生提倡革命……凡属炎黄旧裔，血气之伦，皆当奋起……”等语。我和几个同学看了之后，都非常感动，一面把这张宣传品秘密藏起来、避免惹祸，一面与同学商量怎样表示响应孙先生的革命，我提议先把辫子剪了，表示不服从清制，共寝室的陈君阳、陈叔平、董仲光、陈仲陶、刘复中……诸同学都同意，一夕之间，全剪了辫子。此事虽小，可是引起不便。这时，清廷严防革命，官吏往往以捉拿革命党为立功升官的机会，我们剪了辫子的，万一被认为有革命党的嫌疑，捉将官里去，怎么办呢？于是在寒假回乡的时候，仍旧在小帽里装了一条小辫子。
    1912年，我已经毕业了，还在杭州，一天在街上看见大招贴，知道孙先生要在马坡巷法政学堂演说，我高兴极了。一到时间，我便抢先进会场，坐在第一排。他激昂慷慨的演词，句句动人。听完了演说之后，一位姓沈的，带我和何、严两个青年，到休息室里，见孙先生。他询问我们几句，勉励我们几句，时间虽很短，而他爱护青年的热情，从态度上和言词上，完全可以表现出来，这印象深深地留在我的脑际，永久不会消失。从此以后，我遄返故乡，埋头于教育生活和文艺工作，没有机会再见孙中山先生了。
    今年是孙中山先生诞辰九十周年，我在这个时候，有机会参谒先生的衣冠冢，我心中情不自禁地，有很大的感想。孙中山先生是一位伟大的民主革命先行者，一生辛苦致力革命事业，可是他的理想，过去还没有实现，今天才实现了。今天的中国，已成为一个独立自由幸福的国家，前面正有无穷的美景。假使孙中山先生死而有知，他一定是多么高兴呀！
