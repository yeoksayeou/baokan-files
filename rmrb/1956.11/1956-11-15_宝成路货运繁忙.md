Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 12th – Since the Baoji-Chengdu Railway began regular freight train service in October, the connection between Sichuan Province and other parts of the country has become closer. Chongqing has received steel, anti-corrosion railway sleepers, and general merchandise from all over the country via the railway. Trainloads of tanker cars from the Yumen Oilfield have appeared at stations in the suburbs of Chengdu. The last steel beam for the Fuxi River Bridge on the Neijiang-Kunming Railway was also successfully transported from Anshan Iron and Steel to the Neijiang-Kunming Railway construction site by rail.

Gasoline, diesel, lubricating oil, and steel, which were previously transported by the Sichuan River, have begun to be rerouted on a large scale. In October alone, more than 14,000 tons were transported into Sichuan via the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Grain, which was previously transported out of Sichuan via the Sichuan River, also saw more than 15,000 tons transported to various parts of the country via the Baoji-Chengdu Railway in October.

Currently, Guangyuan, an important town in northern Sichuan, has become another land-water transportation hub in Sichuan Province. Hundreds of wooden boats on the Jialing River are picking up general merchandise and fabrics unloaded from trains in Guangyuan and transporting them to various places along the river. The Chengdu Railway Station is also experiencing unprecedented busyness.

    宝成路货运繁忙
    新华社重庆12日电　宝成铁路从10月份定期行驶货物列车以来，四川省和全国各地的联系更加密切了。重庆市已由铁路运来全国各地的钢材、防腐枕木和日用百货。成都市郊的车站出现了来自玉门油矿的成列的油罐车。内昆铁路釜溪河大桥最后一孔钢梁，也从鞍钢经过铁路顺利地运到内昆铁路工地。
    一向由川江运进的汽油、柴油、润滑油和钢材已经开始大规模改道。仅10月份经宝成铁路运进四川的就有一万四千多吨。一向由川江运出的粮食，10月份也有一万五千多吨经宝成铁路运往全国各地。
    目前，四川北部重镇广元，已经成为四川省另一水陆联运枢纽。嘉陵江上数以百计的木船正在广元接运从火车上卸下来的日用百货和布匹等，再运往沿江各地。成都火车站也出现前所未有的繁忙景象。
