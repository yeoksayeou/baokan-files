Heilongjiang Daily Discussion: What are the Main Contradictions in Rural Areas After Advanced Cooperativization?

Starting from September 9th, the Heilongjiang Daily organized a discussion on the question of what the main contradictions in rural areas are after advanced cooperativization, and received many articles participating in the discussion. As of November 9th, a total of six articles have been selected and published, putting forward several different views, the main points of which are as follows:

The first opinion is that the backwardness of the new economy and business management is the main contradiction in rural areas today after advanced cooperativization. This is because: First, at present, cooperative societies generally have some problems in business management that urgently need to be solved. If these problems are not solved, that is, if business management is not improved, production development will be seriously hindered. Therefore, the gradual resolution of this contradiction is the key to whether agricultural production can grow rapidly at present. Second, increasing the income of members is a basic condition for consolidating cooperative societies, but to increase the income of members, it is necessary not only to increase production but also to run the society diligently and frugally and to distribute income correctly. Whether this can be achieved depends mainly on the quality of business management (especially financial management). Third, if business management cannot adapt to the contradictions of the new economic relations, it will have an important impact and effect on many contradictions in rural areas today. The backwardness of business management has a negative impact on the individualistic and selfish psychology of members and on the full utilization of existing means of production, and it causes or deepens the development of contradictions in these areas.

The second opinion is that the relationship between individual interests and collective interests is the main contradiction in rural areas today. This is because, after advanced cooperativization, the Party's main task in rural areas is to comprehensively consolidate this new type of socialist economy politically and economically, and to rely on it to develop agricultural production on a large scale. To this end, it is necessary to mobilize all positive factors that can be mobilized in rural areas, strive to increase productivity, and comprehensively develop agricultural production. And in the productive forces, the decisive factor is the laborers. This makes it understandable that the key to increasing rural productivity lies in improving the production enthusiasm of laborers and fully utilizing all the positive factors of laborers in building socialism. However, the main problem currently hindering the exertion of laborers' production enthusiasm is the excessive emphasis on collective interests and the neglect of individual interests. Therefore, to increase productivity and give full play to the labor enthusiasm of farmers, it is necessary to correctly handle the issue of collective and individual interests. And the issue of individual interests and collective interests has become a basic issue that promotes everything and drives everything in rural areas today, and it has also become a major contradiction in rural areas today.

The third opinion is that the contradiction between the vast number of members' demands for running advanced high-level cooperatives well and the current reality of agricultural cooperatives is the main contradiction in rural areas today. This is also the contradiction between the needs of the peasant masses for increased production, increased income, and cultural life and the inability of current production, income, and cultural and economic life to meet those needs. The essence of this contradiction is actually the contradiction between the advanced socialist nature of economic organizations and the backward productive forces, that is, the contradiction between the new relations of production and the old productive forces. Because the aforementioned contradictions between new economic organizations and backward management, or between individuals and collectives, all arise under these circumstances. At the same time, from the perspective of resolving contradictions, resolving the contradictions between individuals and collectives, and between new economic organizations and backward management, are all for the overall resolution of the contradiction between the new relations of production and the backward productive forces, and serve it. Of course, solving the problems of backward management, individual and collective relations, etc., is very important in current rural work, but the resolution of these problems can only solve certain aspects of rural social development issues, and not the basic and main aspects. The main issue is still the development of social productive forces.

The fourth opinion is that the contradiction between the advanced socialist system and the backward social productive forces is the main contradiction in rural areas today. Because, China's advanced cooperative societies were established without mechanization, and China's industry cannot currently supply a large number of agricultural machines to rural areas to mechanize agriculture. Therefore, the current rural production tools and technical level are basically handicraft-style. This handicraft-style production tool and technology make it impossible for advanced cooperative societies to fully exert their superiority and make productivity improve rapidly. As a result, after joining the cooperative, farmers actively demand large machine production and demand to increase productivity quickly, but in reality, the backward productive forces cannot meet this demand. This contradiction between the advanced social system and the backward productive forces is the main contradiction in rural areas today. And due to the existence of this contradiction, some other inevitable contradictions have also arisen, such as the contradictions between individuals and collectives, between the long-term interests and current interests of the society, and a series of other contradictions.

This discussion is still ongoing.

### 黑龙江日报讨论：高级合作化后农村的主要矛盾是什么？

    黑龙江日报讨论：高级合作化后农村的主要矛盾是什么？
    高级合作化后，农村的主要矛盾是什么？黑龙江日报于9月9日开始，组织了关于这一问题的讨论，收到了很多参加讨论的文章。到11月9日止，一共选刊了六篇文章，提出了几种不同的看法，主要的论点如下：
    第一种意见认为，新的经济和经营管理上的落后是高级合作化后当前农村的主要矛盾。这因为：第一，目前合作社在经营管理方面普遍存在着一些急待解决的问题，这些问题如不解决，即经营管理不改善不提高，生产的发展就会受到严重的阻碍。所以，这个矛盾的逐步解决，是目前农业生产能否迅速增长的关键。第二，增加社员收入是巩固合作社的一个基本条件，但是要增加社员收入，不仅要增加生产，还必须勤俭办社和正确分配收益。而能否做到这一点，主要在于经营管理工作（首先是财务管理）的好坏。第三，经营管理如不能适应新的经济关系的矛盾，对当前农村中许多矛盾都起着重要的影响和作用。经营管理的落后，对社员的个人主义自私心理，对现有生产资料的充分利用都发生不好的影响，并引起或者加深这些方面矛盾的发展。
    第二种意见认为，个人利益和集体利益的关系，是当前农村的主要矛盾。这因为，高级合作化后，党在农村的主要任务是从政治上、经济上全面地巩固这种新型的社会主义经济，并依靠它大规模地发展农业生产。为此，就必须调动农村一切可以调动的积极因素，努力提高生产力，全面地发展农业生产。而在生产力中，起决定性因素的又是劳动者。这就可以理解，提高农村生产力的关键，就在于提高劳动者的生产积极性并充分发挥劳动者的一切建设社会主义的积极因素。但目前妨碍劳动者生产积极性发挥的主要问题，就是过分地强调了集体利益，忽视了个人的利益。因此，要提高生产力，发挥农民的劳动积极性，就必须正确处理集体和个人的利益问题。而个人利益和集体利益就成了当前农村中推动一切、带动一切的一个基本问题，也就成了当前农村中的一个主要矛盾。
    第三种意见认为，广大社员要求办好先进的高级社和当前农业社现实状况之间的矛盾才是当前农村的主要矛盾。这也就是农民群众对增加生产、增加收入以及文化生活的需要和当前生产、收入以及文化经济生活不能满足需要之间的矛盾。这种矛盾的本质，实际上就是先进的社会主义性质的经济组织和落后的生产力之间的矛盾，也就是新的生产关系和旧的生产力的矛盾。因为前述新的经济组织和管理落后之间，或者是个人和集体之间的矛盾，都是在这种情况下出现的。同时，从解决矛盾的关系来看，解决个人和集体之间的矛盾、新经济组织和管理落后之间的矛盾，都是为了总的解决新的生产关系和落后生产力之间的矛盾，并且为它而服务的。当然，解决管理落后、个人和集体关系等矛盾问题，在当前农村工作中是很重要的，但是，这些问题的解决，都只能解决农村社会发展问题上的某些方面。而不是基本的和主要的方面，主要的还是社会生产力的发展问题。
    第四种意见认为，先进的社会主义制度同落后的社会生产力之间的矛盾是当前农村的主要矛盾。因为，我国的高级合作社是在没有机械化的情况下建立起来的，我国工业目前还不能供给农村大量的农业机器使农业机械化，所以目前农村生产工具和技术水平基本上是手工业式的。这种手工业式的生产工具和技术就使高级合作社不能充分发挥其优越性，使生产力得到很快的提高。其结果，农民入社后积极要求大机器生产，要求很快地提高生产力，但实际上，落后的生产力不能满足这一要求。这种先进的社会制度和落后的生产力之间的矛盾才是当前农村的主要矛盾。而由于这一矛盾的存在，也就产生了其他一些难免的矛盾，如个人和集体之间、社的长远利益和当前利益等一系列的矛盾。
    这一讨论现在仍在继续进行中。
