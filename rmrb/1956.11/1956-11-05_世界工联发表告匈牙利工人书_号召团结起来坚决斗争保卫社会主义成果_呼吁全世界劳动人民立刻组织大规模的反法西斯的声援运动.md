Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 4th. The World Federation of Trade Unions issued a letter to Hungarian workers and workers of the world here on November 3rd, signed by General Secretary Louis Saillant.

The letter to the workers stated that in Hungary, the danger of fascism is growing. Reactionary forces have once again raised their heads. Now, they are clearly exposing a long-planned conspiracy. They are attempting to restore old privileges, return factories to capitalists, allow big landlords to repossess their old territories, and eliminate fundamental socialist achievements.

They want to deceive the working people, instigating them to oppose the socialist camp, just as they have tried to do in all past counter-revolutionary adventures and during the great October Revolution of 1917.

In order to maintain their gains, the counter-revolutionary forces are trying to eliminate all those who oppose their conspiracy through terror. Armed bandits are using hanging, shooting, and torture. Today, we seem to be witnessing the restoration of the White forces in Hungary in 1919.

In this complex situation, the World Federation of Trade Unions believes it has a responsibility to once again warn the Hungarian working people and the Central Council of Hungarian Trade Unions about this grave danger. The moment for their active unity and increased vigilance has arrived.

The World Federation of Trade Unions believes that the Hungarian working people will closely unite their ranks, restore the democratic life of the trade unions, and unite all national forces who hate fascism around them, engaging in a determined struggle to defend socialist achievements, thereby preventing the restoration of old privilege groups and suppressing domestic counter-revolutionary terror.

The World Federation of Trade Unions assures the Hungarian working people as brothers that in this struggle, they can count on the full and enthusiastic solidarity of the working people of the world and all democratic and progressive forces.

The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on the working people of the world and their trade unions to immediately organize a large-scale anti-fascist solidarity movement.

The World Federation of Trade Unions reiterates its complete trust in the Hungarian working people. It believes that the Hungarian working people will be vigilant and will strive to keep Hungary in the ever-advancing camp of peace, and to continue to be a country that enjoys national sovereignty and is advancing on the road of social progress, democracy, and socialism.

    世界工联发表告匈牙利工人书
    号召团结起来坚决斗争保卫社会主义成果
    呼吁全世界劳动人民立刻组织大规模的反法西斯的声援运动
    新华社布拉格4日电　世界工会联合会11月3日在这里发表了由总书记路易·赛扬签署的告匈牙利工人和全世界工人书。
    告工人书中说，在匈牙利，法西斯主义的危险越来越大了。反动势力已经又一次抬头了。现在，他们正在明显地暴露出了秘密策划已久的阴谋。他们企图恢复旧有的特权，把工厂归还资本家，使大地主重新占有旧有领地，消灭基本的社会主义成果。
    他们想欺骗劳动人民，唆使劳动人民去反对社会主义阵营，就像他们在过去的一切反革命冒险中和1917年伟大的十月革命时期所力图做的那样。
    为了保持已得的成就，反革命力量力图用恐怖手段消灭一切反对他们的阴谋的人。武装匪徒正在用绞死、枪杀和拷打的手段。今天我们就像看到了1919年白色分子在匈牙利复辟的景象。
    在这种复杂的情况下，世界工联认为它自己有责任就这种严重危险再次向匈牙利劳动人民和匈牙利工会中央理事会发出警告。他们积极团结和提高警惕的时刻已经来到了。
    世界工联相信，匈牙利劳动人民将紧密团结自己的队伍，重新恢复工会的民主生活，并且把痛恨法西斯主义的一切民族力量团结在自己的周围，进行坚决的斗争以保卫社会主义成果，从而阻止往日的特权集团的复辟，镇压国内的反革命恐怖。
    世界工会联合会向匈牙利劳动人民作兄弟的保证，在这次斗争中，他们可以指望得到全世界劳动人民和一切民主和进步力量的充分和热烈的声援。
    世界工联号召全世界劳动人民和他们的工会立刻组织大规模的反法西斯声援运动。
    世界工会联合会再次表示对匈牙利劳动人民的完全信任。它相信，匈牙利劳动人民将提高警惕，并且将争取使匈牙利留在不断前进的和平阵营里，使匈牙利继续是享有国家主权、并且是在社会进步、民主和社会主义道路上迈进的国家。
