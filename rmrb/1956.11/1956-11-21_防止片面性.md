Preventing One-Sidedness
Shi Hong

There is a phenomenon of one-sidedness currently in investigative work. Some cadres, when going to the grassroots to understand the situation, often don't first acquire a large amount of material and conduct a comprehensive analysis to arrive at appropriate conclusions. Instead, they start from subjective intentions, seize upon some superficial phenomena, and then force conclusions, resulting in a great deal of subjectivity and blindness in their work.

In 1953, Shanghai factories conducted an education campaign among workers against purely economic viewpoints. The higher-level organization said that workers held purely economic viewpoints, so when cadres went to the factories to understand the situation, they collected materials everywhere about workers' "hedonistic" thought manifestations in order to illustrate the harm of purely economic viewpoints. To achieve the goal of collecting materials, they described some phenomena unrelated to purely economic viewpoints as manifestations of purely economic viewpoints. For example, female workers perming their hair and wearing colorful clothes were used to illustrate the evil consequences of purely economic viewpoints. As a result, people were panicked, and even workers dared not hang a piece of salted meat at home, because if the cadres saw it, they would take it as an "example" of workers' hedonistic behavior.

The situation has changed greatly this year. The higher-level leading organs say that the factory's leadership personnel have a phenomenon of not caring about the workers' living difficulties, so the cadres of the lower-level organs are collecting materials everywhere about the workers' living difficulties. Some workers' lives are not bitter, but the cadres still chase after them and ask: "What difficulties do you have? Tell me, I can reflect it upwards and help you solve it." Many factory trade unions respond to every request. As long as the worker is short of money, they think he must have "difficulties," so they subsidize him. A Communist Party member of the Shanghai Lixing Thermos Factory said to the branch secretary with distress: "The masses of workers in our workshop do not need relief. What should we do?" He was worried that he would be criticized by the branch for not caring about the masses. Some Party members braced themselves to find materials in this regard. Now some people are even questioning whether it was wrong to oppose purely economic viewpoints in 1953.

Are the workers' living difficulties a new phenomenon that emerged in 1956? Of course not. It's just that in 1953, when the cadres went down to understand the situation, they didn't make a comprehensive understanding and didn't analyze and study the problem. They only looked for materials related to the manifestations of "purely economic viewpoints," resulting in an excessive exaggeration of that aspect of the situation and neglecting this aspect of the situation. And now? It's just the opposite.

This one-sidedness in investigative work has fostered bad habits among some grassroots cadres of not going deep into their work, not being diligent, and lacking analysis and research on problems. Some grassroots cadres said: "We have both 'leftist' and 'rightist' materials on hand. If the higher-level says that the current work is 'leftist,' we will take out the 'leftist' materials. If the higher-level says that the current work is 'rightist,' we will take out the 'rightist' materials. But whether it is 'leftist' or 'rightist,' we are not clear." Obviously, even if there is more such material, it cannot accurately reflect the actual situation.

Investigative work can overcome subjectivism, but if this kind of work style is not changed, subjectivism still cannot be overcome.

    防止片面性
    世鸿
    目前在调查工作中有一种片面性的现象。有些干部到基层去了解情况，往往不是首先占有大量材料，进行全面分析，从而做出恰当的结论；而是从主观意图出发，抓住一些表面现象，就牵强附会地来下结论，结果就使工作带上很大的主观性和盲目性。
    1953年，上海各工厂曾在工人中进行过一次反对单纯经济观点的教育。上级组织说，工人中有单纯经济观点，于是干部到工厂中去了解情况时就到处收集工人“享乐主义”思想表现的材料，以便说明单纯经济观点的危害性。为了达到收集材料的目的，他们把一些和单纯经济观点无关的现象也说成是单纯经济观点的表现。譬如说，女工烫头发，穿花衣服，这些也都用来说明单纯经济观点造成的恶果。结果弄得人心惶惶，甚至工人不敢在家中挂一块咸肉，因为干部来看到了也会拿去当作工人享乐主义表现的一个“例子”。
    今年情况大变了。上级领导机关说工厂的领导人员有不关心工人生活疾苦的现象，于是下级机关的干部到处收集工人生活疾苦的材料。有些工人生活并不苦，干部还追着问：“你到底有什么困难，告诉我，我可以反映上去，帮你解决。”许多工厂的工会是有求必应，只要工人手头没有钱，就认为他一定有“困难”，于是就补助他。上海立兴热水瓶厂一个党员对支部书记苦恼地说：“我们车间内工人群众不需要救济，怎么办呢？”他担心因此会受到支部的批评，说他不关心群众。有些党员则硬着头皮去找这方面的材料。现在有些人甚至在怀疑1953年反对单纯经济观点是否反错了。
    难道工人生活疾苦是1956年产生的新现象吗？当然不是的，只是1953年干部下去了解情况时不作全盘了解，对问题不作分析研究，光找有关“单纯经济观点”的表现的材料，结果就过分地夸大了那一方面的情况，忽视了这方面的情况；现在呢？则又刚相反。
    调查工作中这种片面性养成了一些基层干部在工作时不深入，不艰苦，对问题缺乏分析研究的坏习惯。有些基层干部说：“我们手头‘左’、右两种材料都有，上级如说现在工作‘左’了，我们就拿出‘左’的材料；上级说现在工作中‘右’了，我们就拿出右的材料，但到底是‘左’是‘右’，我们也不清楚。”显然，这样的材料即使更多，也不能恰如其分地反映实际情况。
    调查工作可以克服主观主义，但如果像上面这种工作作风不改变，主观主义还是克服不了的。
