Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 29th: The United Nations General Assembly continued its general debate on the morning and afternoon of November 28th.

    Bulgarian Foreign Minister Lukanov said that the aggression against Egypt must be ended, and all invading forces must be withdrawn from the country immediately.

    Lukanov demanded the restoration of the lawful seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

    Sudanese Foreign Minister Mahgoub also demanded the withdrawal of British, French, and Israeli troops, and he also demanded that the United Nations instruct Britain and France to compensate Egypt for the losses caused by their aggression.

    Yugoslav State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Popovic condemned the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt. He said that it is not permissible to use the troops stationed on Egyptian territory to exert pressure on Egypt to obtain concessions. Speaking of the situation in Hungary, he said that "the explanations made by the directly concerned government cannot satisfy anyone." At the same time, he expressed the hope that a calm and normal life would soon be restored in Hungary and advised "certain foreign politicians not to exploit the current difficulties of the Hungarian people for propaganda and to achieve their strategic goals."

    French representative Broustra tried to deny the news that France was continuing to amass troops in Egypt.

    Cuban representative Núñez-Portuondo once again made inflammatory remarks about the situation in Hungary.

    Then, Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi spoke.

    He sternly condemned the aggression by Britain, France, and Israel and demanded that the United Nations investigate this act of aggression. He said that the United Nations should conduct a thorough investigation of all the conspiracies, plans, and events of this conspiracy and tripartite aggression in order to identify the perpetrators. In addition, Egypt's right to compensation must be recognized. The enormous damage and destruction suffered by Egypt must be restored.

    Fawzi said: The dignity of the United Nations Charter has been utterly destroyed by Britain, France, and Israel. Their despicable conspiracy and aggression against Egypt will be forever infamous in the record of treachery and shame.

    Fawzi said that we have repeatedly waited for the three aggressors to have a minimum of respect for world opinion, but it has been in vain for us to wait for this to happen.

    Fawzi said that the Egyptian question confronts the world with a choice: to conduct world cooperation on the basis of equality, or to maintain the degenerate relations of tyranny and colonialism?

    Fawzi finally demanded that Britain, France, and Israel fully comply with the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and stop playing the most vulgar and inappropriate hide-and-seek games with these resolutions. Fawzi expressed his gratitude to those who supported Egypt's resistance to aggression, saying that Egypt "will always remember, will never forget the good deeds of those who sincerely supported Egypt in times of trial and emergency."

    Indonesian Foreign Minister Abdulgani demanded the complete and unconditional withdrawal of British, French, and Israeli forces from Egypt.

    Abdulgani expressed regret that the People's Republic of China was excluded from the United Nations.

    Representatives of the Netherlands, Thailand, and Chile also spoke at the meeting that day.

    联大继续进行一般性辩论
    埃及外长要求彻底调查英法以侵略行为
    据新华社29日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会11月28日上午和下午继续进行一般性辩论。
    保加利亚外交部长卢卡诺夫说，必须结束对埃及的侵略、立刻从这个国家撤出所有的侵略部队。
    卢卡诺夫要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位。
    苏丹外交部长马哈古卜也要求英、法和以色列军队撤退，他并且要求联合国责成英法两国赔偿由于它们侵略埃及而给埃及带来的损失。
    南斯拉夫外交国务秘书长波波维奇谴责英、法和以色列对埃及的侵略。他说，不许可利用驻在埃及国土上的部队来对埃及施加压力以取得让步。在谈到匈牙利局势的时候，他说“直接有关的政府所作的解释并不能使任何人感到满意”。同时，他表示希望平静和正常的生活很快在匈牙利恢复，并且劝告“某些外国政界人士不要利用匈牙利人民目前的困难来进行宣传和达到他们的战略目的”。
    法国代表布鲁斯特拉力图否认法国继续在埃及集结部队的消息。
    古巴代表努奈斯—波图翁多再一次就匈牙利局势作了煽惑性的发言。
    接着，埃及外交部长法齐发言。
    他义正词严地斥责英、法和以色列的侵略，并且要求联合国对这种侵略行为进行调查。他说，联合国应该对这个共谋和三国侵略的一切阴谋计划和事件进行彻底的调查，以便判明犯罪者。此外，埃及要求赔偿的权利必须得到承认。埃及所遭受的巨大损伤和破坏必须得到恢复。
    法齐说：联合国宪章的尊严已经在英、法和以色列的手中破坏无遗，它们对埃及的卑鄙阴谋和侵略将在背信和耻辱的记录上遗臭万年。
    法齐说，我们一再等待三个侵略者对世界舆论有最低限度的尊重，但是我们等待这种事情的发生是徒然的。
    法齐说，埃及问题使世界面临这样的抉择：究竟在平等的基础上进行世界合作呢？还是保持暴政和殖民主义的退化的关系呢？
    法齐最后要求英、法和以色列完全遵从联合国大会的决议，并且停止他们对这些决议所玩的最下流和最不应该的捉迷藏的把戏。法齐对支持埃及反抗侵略的人们表示感谢，他说，埃及“将永远记住，将永远不会忘记那些在考验的时刻和紧急的时候真诚地支持埃及的人们的好的行动。”
    印度尼西亚外交部长阿卜杜加尼要求英、法和以色列完全而无条件地退出埃及。
    阿卜杜加尼对中华人民共和国被排斥在联合国之外表示遗憾。
    在这一天会议上发言的还有荷兰、泰国和智利等国家的代表。
