Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 15th. The three paper mills affiliated with the state-owned Sichuan Paper Industry Company—namely, the 601, 602, and Zhongyuan Paper Mills—which account for approximately 70% of Sichuan Province's paper industry output, are undergoing reconstruction.

The Zhongyuan Paper Mill in Yibin, where the reconstruction project began earliest, has essentially completed its first phase and will soon begin trial production. At the Chongqing 601 Paper Mill, newly built bamboo storage warehouses, raw material preparation workshop buildings, finished product workshop buildings, dormitories, and offices have already been erected along the Jialing River. Reconstruction of the original paper mill buildings is scheduled to begin in November. At the Yibin 602 Paper Mill, construction of new paper mill buildings and cooking workshop buildings is now starting with ground leveling.

After the reconstruction projects of all three factories are completed by the end of next year, the production of coated printing paper at the 601 Mill will increase threefold compared to the present, the production of cement bag paper at the Zhongyuan Paper Mill will increase fourfold, and the production of newsprint at the 602 Mill will also increase threefold. Simultaneously, after reconstruction, due to the expanded scale of production, the number of management personnel and production support workers will be relatively reduced, and costs can also be lowered compared to the present.

All three factories have paid attention to improving working conditions during the reconstruction process. After the reconstruction, heavy physical labor in the production process will be replaced by machinery. All three factories will establish cable car wharves on the riverbank for unloading raw materials and finished products. In the production process within the factories, conveyor belts, air ducts, pumps, and other equipment will be used to transport raw materials and rough materials, replacing manual labor.

    四川省改建三个造纸厂
    新华社重庆15日电　约占四川省造纸工业产量70％的国营四川造纸工业公司所属六零一、六零二、中元等三个造纸工厂，正在改建。
    改建工程开始最早的宜宾中元造纸厂，第一期工程已经基本完成，不久就要试生产。重庆六零一造纸厂新建的竹料仓库、备料工段厂房、完成工段厂房、宿舍和办公室等建筑物，已经在嘉陵江边耸立起来；在原有基础上重建的造纸厂房，也在11月动工。宜宾六零二造纸厂新建的造纸厂房和蒸煮工段厂房，现在正在开始平地基。
    三个工厂的改建工程在明年年底全部完成以后，六○一厂的胶板印刷纸产量将比现在增加三倍，中元造纸厂水泥袋纸的产量将增加四倍，六○二厂新闻纸的产量也将增加三倍。同时，三个厂在改建以后，因为生产规模扩大，管理人员和生产辅助工人相对减少，成本也可以比现在降低。
    三个工厂在改建中都注意了改善劳动条件。改建以后，生产过程中的笨重体力劳动将由机械代替。三个厂都将在河边建立起卸原材料和成品的缆车码头。在厂内的生产过程中，也将用运输带、风管、泵浦等代替人力，来输送原料和粗料。
