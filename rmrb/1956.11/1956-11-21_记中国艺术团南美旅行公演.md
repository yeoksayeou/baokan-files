    A Record of the Chinese Art Troupe's Performance Tour in South America
    Zhao Feng
    The Chinese Art Troupe's performance tour in Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina was widely welcomed by the people of South American countries. Public opinion pointed out that this was a new milestone in the cultural relations between China and Latin America, and also a major event in Latin American cultural life.
    When the agent organizing the Chinese Art Troupe's South American performances contacted theaters in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, the locals all thought: "It is hard to imagine that a foreign troupe, especially one visiting for the first time, would perform in each city for two weeks." The Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, considered one of the largest theaters in the Americas, regularly features world-class singers during its opera season. Even this grand theater, with the longest history, most seats, and best acoustics in the Americas, also believed that it was unprecedented in more than a decade for a foreign troupe to perform continuously for half a month and still be frequently sold out. In São Paulo, Brazil, a stage manager who had worked at the Municipal Theater for forty-five years said: "In his lifetime of theatrical experience, he had never seen a foreign troupe receive such a warm welcome from the Brazilian public."
    I recall that when I first arrived in Santiago, Chile, many Chilean friends who had been to Europe and China repeatedly told me: "The South American public is not like the Parisian public, and in another sense, not like the Chinese public, because they are not as enthusiastic as Parisians, nor as sentimental as Beijingers. If they don't applaud as enthusiastically, it definitely doesn't mean they don't like your art." But the reality exceeded the expectations of these friends. The South American public can be said to have welcomed the Chinese artists from afar with rare enthusiasm. Many beautiful memories will be forever unforgettable for the Chinese artists. In the cold early spring of Santiago, even though our performance had already started for more than an hour, hundreds of people were often still waiting outside the theater. The actors of Montevideo, due to the frequent conflicts with our performance times, did not have the opportunity to see our performances. We organized a report and a small performance to entertain them. Our Uruguayan colleagues unanimously believed that our performance methods, training methods, and the characteristics of our classical drama art expression had a great inspiration for their future artistic creation. Critics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, believed that this was the most successful performance in the history of the Municipal Theater. After each performance in Buenos Aires, the public sometimes even waited in the late night rain to pay tribute to the actors. In the last few days, people had to queue for two or three hours to buy tickets.
    Chinese classical drama reached more than 146,000 direct audience members in Latin America, and more than 1.5 million viewers watched through television. In particular, we had the opportunity to make initial contact with leaders in the Latin American cultural and artistic circles, as well as the social public. We also had the opportunity to appreciate the outstanding artistic creations of Latin American artists and to come into contact with the Latin American cultural and artistic traditions and rich and diverse folk art. Undoubtedly, this is of great significance for promoting mutual understanding between the people of China and Latin America.
    The high respect of Latin American people for Chinese culture is extremely touching. For example, many museums collect ancient Chinese works of art. In the National Museum of Decorative Arts in Buenos Aires, nearly one-third of the exhibits are Chinese works of art. Many families consider it an honor to have a Chinese object, and many women flaunt their Chinese silk clothes in theaters and at banquets. People talk about Lao Tzu and Confucius with reverence. However, despite this, there is really too little contact and understanding between the Chinese and South American people. Some even say that no country seems as well understood as China, but in reality is more misunderstood. A Brazilian friend asked: Do Chinese children only know about Indians and poisonous snakes when it comes to Brazil? Similarly, the Chinese art exhibition held in Buenos Aires, in addition to many extremely beautiful and precious exhibits, also displayed the shoes of Chinese women with bound feet and opium pipes. Therefore, a newspaper reported when the Chinese Art Troupe first performed: "Strangely, why are the Chinese not surprised." This shows how important it is to strengthen contact and understanding between the people of the world. Chinese artists are proud to be able to make some contribution to this noble cause and are willing to make further efforts.
    The travel performance of the Chinese Art Troupe was particularly praised by the cultural and artistic circles and the social public in South America. In addition to the unique characteristics of Chinese classical drama in content and form, it is also because of the attitude and work that the Chinese people have towards their own national cultural heritage. Through the specific programs performed by the Chinese Art Troupe, many South American cultural and artistic figures often talked to us about how to establish and develop new artistic creations on the basis of national traditions. They often said that "Chinese artists treat national heritage with respect, critically reform with caution, and actively and boldly create, which is of great reference significance to them." After watching our performance, a famous folklorist was so moved that he gave us the original manuscript of his thesis on folk pottery art and said: "Your performance will have an impact on my research methods." When Chinese artists talked to them about the issue of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," they believed that this was not only enlightening to them but also of practical significance to them.
    The unique characteristics of Chinese classical drama in content and form have led many critics to unanimously believe that "Chinese Peking Opera has opened up a new world of drama." A Brazilian newspaper said that only after we watched the performance did we understand why the European theater community, inspired by Chinese classical drama, proposed the necessity and possibility of reforming Western drama forms. Professor Olto of the University of Chile said: "Chinese drama is an all-round drama. This form of drama that combines song, dance, poetry, drama, and music into one is the goal that the West is pursuing but has not yet achieved." South American public opinion praised the realistic content of Chinese classical drama, and also praised the realistic expression methods and unique national characteristics of Chinese classical drama. The Chilean magazine "Eva" said: "Chinese classical drama vividly and realistically portrays human life, and the audience can very easily understand everything they perform." The Argentine newspaper "La Prensa" said: "The realistic approach enables Chinese artists to keenly observe things and human feelings, and subtly express things and human feelings."
    South American public opinion and the public unanimously praised the talents of Chinese actors and artists. The Chilean newspaper "Ultimas Noticias" said: "The speed of the Chinese actors' movements is as brilliant as the fireworks and as fast as the sparks." The famous Brazilian poet Mendes said: "The performance of the Chinese Art Troupe is wonderful, perfect, great, and unique." Professor Castello, a famous Brazilian scholar, said: "The performance of Chinese art is wonderful. Before I find another adjective, I can only say it is wonderful." The Chilean Minister of Education, Vidal, said: "This is an amazing performance, almost unbelievable." Many newspapers said that the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe was a brilliant and unprecedented success.
    The rich and diverse characteristics of Chinese folk songs and dances and their full of life atmosphere gave the South American public and cultural and artistic circles a very deep impression. People often say: "The Red Silk Dance shows the spirit and joy of the Chinese people, and the Lotus Dance is as gentle and beautiful as a dream." The performance of Chinese folk music made many composers believe that they can find healthy creative principles from it, that is, to concentrate on using melody as the main means of expression, and to use varied timbre contrasts to replace complicated orchestration methods. Chinese singers performed folk songs from South American countries, which was regarded by the South American public as a concrete expression of friendship. Young Chinese dancers learned South American folk dances, which was considered a respect for South American cultural traditions by Chinese artists and became a beautiful story in the dance world.
    The South American tour of the Chinese Art Troupe concretely demonstrated the Chinese people's friendly wishes to the South American people. Therefore, the South American public also warmly received the Chinese Art Troupe. Similarly, it should be said that the South American people's friendly reception of Chinese artists is also a manifestation of the South American people's general desire to strengthen friendly cultural relations with the Chinese people. The Chinese Art Troupe will never forget the mountains, rivers, and cultural relics of South America; but even more, they will not forget the warm friendship of the South American people. The many beautiful memories of the Chinese artists' visit to South America, especially the initial contact with the customs and culture of South America, will surely help the future artistic creation of the Chinese artists. But more importantly, the South American tour of the Chinese Art Troupe marks a new beginning of the friendly relations between the Chinese and South American people. Not to mention, almost all the South American colleagues we contacted expressed their strong desire to visit China, and the South American public unanimously hoped that the Chinese Art Troupe could visit South America again in the near future. This alone is enough to show how eager the people of the world are to strengthen mutual understanding, and strengthening this cultural relationship will surely have a beneficial and lasting impact and contribution to strengthening the friendly relations between the people of all countries and enriching the national cultures of the people of all countries.

    记中国艺术团南美旅行公演
    赵沨
    中国艺术团在智利、乌拉圭、巴西、阿根廷作了旅行演出，受到了南美各国人民的普遍欢迎。舆论指出这是中国和拉丁美洲文化关系的新的里程碑，也是拉丁美洲文化生活中的重大事件。
    组织中国艺术团南美演出的代理人，同阿根廷、巴西、智利这些国家的剧场接洽的时候，当地的人们都认为：“一个外国剧团，特别是初次访问的外国剧团，要在每个城市演出两个星期之久，这是很难想像的”。被认为美洲最大剧场之一的布宜诺斯艾利斯的科郎剧场，它的歌剧季节经常有世界第一流的歌星们参加。就连这个在南北美洲历史最久，座位最多、建筑音响最好的大剧院，同样也认为一个外国剧团能连续表演半个月而常常满座，是十多年来从未有过的。在巴西的圣保罗，一个在市立剧院服务四十五年的舞台监督说：“在他一生的戏剧生活的经历中，从未见过一个外国剧团受到巴西公众如此热烈的欢迎。”
    我回想起刚到智利的圣地亚哥的时候，许多到过欧洲和中国的智利朋友再三向我打招呼说：“南美的公众不像巴黎公众，在另一种意义上也不像中国的公众，因为他们不像巴黎人那样的狂热，和北京人那样的深情，假使他们不那样热烈地鼓掌，这绝对不是表示他们不喜爱你们的艺术”。但是事实超乎这些朋友们的意料之外，南美的公众可以说用一种少见的热情欢迎了远道而来的中国艺术家。许多美丽的记忆将是中国艺术家永远难以忘记的。在寒冷的圣地亚哥的初春，虽然我们的演出已经开始了一个多钟头了，而剧场外面还经常守候着数以百计的公众。蒙得维的亚的戏剧演员们由于我们相互的演出时间经常冲突，没有机会能看到我们的演出，我们组织了一个报告会和一个小型的演出来招待他们。乌拉圭同行们一致认为，我们的表演方法和训练方法以及我们古典戏剧艺术表现上的特点，对于他们今后的艺术创造有着极大的启发意义。巴西里约热内卢的评论家认为这是市立剧院有历史以来最成功的演出。布宜诺斯艾利斯的公众每当演出完毕后，有时甚至冒着雨在深夜守候着向演员们致意。最后几天购票的人要排队守候二、三个小时方能买到戏票。
    中国古典戏剧在拉丁美洲的直接观众达十四万六千多人，通过电视欣赏的观众在一百五十万人以上。特别是我们有机会能和拉丁美洲文化艺术界，以及社会公众的领袖做了初次的接触。而我们也得到机会欣赏拉丁美洲艺术家们的优秀艺术创造，接触了拉丁美洲的文化艺术传统和丰富多采的民间艺术，无疑地这对促进中国和拉丁美洲人民间的相互了解是有着重大意义的。
    拉丁美洲人民对中国文化高度尊重的事例，极为令人感动。譬如，许多博物馆收藏着中国古代的艺术品。在布宜诺斯艾利斯的国家装饰博物馆里将近三分之一的展览品都是中国艺术品，许多家庭中以有一件中国器物为荣耀，许多妇女在剧场中和在宴会上向人们炫耀她们的中国丝绸衣服。人们用尊敬的心情谈论着老子、孔子。但是尽管如此，中国和南美人民之间是真的太缺乏接触和了解了。甚至有人说没有一个国家像中国这样看来很为人所了解，而实质上却更多地被人误解。一个巴西朋友问：是否中国的孩子关于巴西只知道印第安人和毒蛇呢？与此相类似，布宜诺斯艾利斯举办的中国艺术展览中，除了许多极美丽、极名贵的展览品外，也展出了中国小脚妇女的鞋子和鸦片烟枪。所以有家报纸在报道中国艺术团首次演出时说：“奇怪的是为什么中国人并不奇怪”。由此可见加强世界各国人民间的接触和了解是如何的重要。中国的艺术家能为这一崇高事业作出些许的贡献，我们引以为荣，并愿作更进一步的努力。
    中国艺术团的旅行演出，所以特别受到南美的文化艺术界和社会公众的推崇，除了中国古典戏剧在内容和形式上所独具的特点之外，还因为中国人民对待自己民族文化遗产所持的态度和所做的工作。通过中国艺术团所演出的具体节目，许多南美文化艺术界人士经常和我们交谈如何在民族传统的基础上建立和发展新的艺术创造的这一问题。他们经常说“中国艺术家尊重地对待民族遗产，慎重地批判改革，积极地大胆创造，这对他们也有着极大的借鉴的意义”。一位著名的民俗学家在看了我们的演出之后，感动地把他所写的民间陶器艺术论文的原稿送给了我们，并且说：“你们的演出将对我的治学方法有所影响”。中国的艺术家们和他们谈到百花齐放、百家争鸣的问题时，他们认为这不仅对他们有所启发而且也将对他们有着实践的意义。
    中国古典戏剧在内容上和形式上所独具的特点，使许多评论一致认为“中国京剧打开了戏剧的一个新世界”。巴西的报纸说只有当我们看了演出之后，才了解为什么欧洲戏剧界因为中国古典戏剧的启发而提出对西方戏剧形式进行改革的必须和可能。智利大学的奥尔托斯教授说：“中国戏剧是一种全能戏剧，这种熔合歌、舞、诗、剧、乐于一炉的戏剧形式是西方正在追求而还未达到的目标。”南美舆论盛赞中国古典戏剧的现实主义的内容，并且对中国古典戏剧的现实主义的表现方法和独具的民族特点也备极赞扬。智利的“埃娃”画报说：“中国古典戏剧逼真地、生动地表现了人的生活，而观众又可以非常容易地了解他们所表演的一切。”阿根廷的“新闻报”说：“现实主义的手法，使中国艺术家能够锐敏地观察事物和人情，并且微妙地表现事物和人情。”
    南美的舆论和公众一致推崇中国演员艺术家们的才能。智利的“最后消息报”说：“中国演员的动作的迅速有如焰火的灿烂和火花般的迅速闪灭”。著名的巴西诗人孟德斯说：“中国艺术团的演出是奇妙的、完美、伟大而独特的”。巴西的著名学者卡斯特洛教授说：“中国艺术之演出是绝妙的，在我还没有找到另外形容词之前，我只能说是绝妙的。”智利的教育部长维达尔说：“这是惊人的演出，甚至几乎是使人难以置信的。”许多报纸都说，中国艺术团的演出，是从未见过的辉煌成功的演出。
    中国民间歌舞的丰富多采和充满生活气息的特点给南美公众和文化艺术界以极为深刻的印象。人们常说：“红绸舞表现了中国人民的气概和欢乐，荷花舞像梦境一样的温柔和美丽。”中国民间音乐的表演，使许多作曲家认为可以从中寻找出健康的创造原则，那就是集中地用曲调来作为主要表现手段，变化多端的音色对比来代替繁琐的配器方法。中国歌唱家表演了南美国家的民歌，被南美公众认为是友谊的具体表现。中国的年青的舞蹈家们学习了南美的民间舞蹈，这被认为是中国艺术家对南美文化传统的尊敬并在舞蹈界传为美谈。
    中国艺术团的南美旅行演出，具体表现了中国人民对南美人民的友好愿望。所以南美的公众也热情地接待了中国艺术团。同样应该说，南美人民对中国艺术家的友好接待也是南美人民极愿加强和中国人民的友好文化关系的普遍愿望的表现。中国艺术团永远忘不了南美的山川文物；但更忘不了南美人民的热烈的情谊。中国艺术家访问南美的许多美丽的回忆，特别是对南美风土文物的初步接触，这必将有助于中国艺术家的今后的艺术创作。但更重要的是中国艺术团南美的旅行演出，标志着中国人民和南美人民友好关系的一个新的开始。别的不说，差不多我们接触到的所有的南美的同行们，都表示了他们也极愿访问中国的愿望，而南美的公众又一致地希望中国艺术团能在不久的将来，再一次地访问南美。仅这一点，就足以说明了世界各国人民间是多么迫切的希望彼此加强相互间的了解，而加强这种文化关系，也必将对加强各国人民的友好关系和丰富各国人民的民族文化有着有益的和久而弥彰的作用和贡献。（附图片）
