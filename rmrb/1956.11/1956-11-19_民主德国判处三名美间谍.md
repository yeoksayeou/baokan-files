Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 18th. According to a report by the German News Agency, the three American spies who were tried in Dresden were sentenced on the 16th to four, five and ten years of imprisonment respectively.

The trial proved that the American spy agency was organizing systematic subversive activities against the people's democratic countries. Since the beginning of 1954, ninety-two spies who had been sent to Poland and Czechoslovakia have been arrested on the territory of the German Democratic Republic. The state prosecutor said that the trial also showed that West Berlin was being used as a base for organizing criminal activities.

    民主德国判处三名美间谍
    新华社柏林18日电　据德意志通讯社报道，在德累斯顿受到审讯的三名美国特务已经在16日分别被判处了四年、五年和十年的徒刑。
    审讯证明，美国特务机关组织着反对人民民主国家的有系统的颠覆活动。从1954年年初以来，在德意志民主共和国领土上已经逮捕了九十二名被派到波兰和捷克斯洛伐克进行活动的间谍。国家检察官说，这次的审讯也说明，西柏林被当作一个组织罪恶活动的基地。
