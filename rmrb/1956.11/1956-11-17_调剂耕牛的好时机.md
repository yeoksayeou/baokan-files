	A Good Time to Regulate Draft Cattle
	Gao Changren
	Since the severe flooding in the counties near Dongting Lake in 1954, Hunan Province has felt a shortage of cattle power. Last winter and this spring, the Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased more than 28,000 head of draft cattle from other provinces and within the province to support areas lacking cattle. However, the lake area still lacks cattle. During the busy spring farming season this year, counties such as Nanxian, Anxiang, and Yuanjiang had to organize large numbers of people to pull plows. In Anxiang County alone, more than 30,000 people were engaged in this arduous labor. According to the preliminary plan of Changde Prefecture, 40,000 head of draft cattle need to be purchased this winter and next spring to meet the needs of agricultural cooperatives for spring plowing next year.
	Between this summer and autumn, the Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent out work groups to conduct many typical investigations. The investigation materials prove that the number of draft cattle and cultivated land is very unbalanced throughout the province. In the lake areas that lack cattle, each head of cattle has to plow an average of more than 60 mu of land throughout the year, while in the mountainous areas that produce cattle, many agricultural cooperatives only plow a dozen to twenty mu per head of cattle. The general situation is that the lake areas lack cattle, the mountainous areas have surplus cattle, and the hilly areas basically have enough cattle for self-sufficiency. If the cattle could be reasonably regulated within the province, the problem of cattle shortage in the lake areas could be basically solved.
	Based on this situation, the Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative is now actively preparing to organize the regulation of draft cattle. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative has formulated a plan to regulate 50,000 head of draft cattle within the province this winter and next spring. After the basic realization of advanced agricultural cooperation throughout the province, cattle transactions have changed from being decentralized to centralized. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative is prepared to adapt to this situation by improving its working methods. Full-time cadres will be assigned in various places to organize and lead the inherent draft cattle markets, reasonably adjust regional price differences and seasonal price differences, promote the natural circulation of draft cattle, and encourage agricultural cooperatives to breed draft cattle. There are still many difficulties in completing the plan to regulate 50,000 head of draft cattle within the province. The most important problem at present is that agricultural cooperatives in cattle-producing areas are not only unwilling to sell marketable draft cattle, but also try their best to purchase strong cattle; however, small cattle that enter the cooperative are still regarded as a "burden," either lowering the price during valuation or selling them cheaply after entering the cooperative. Therefore, it is difficult to regulate draft cattle well by relying solely on the economic work of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. It is necessary to educate agricultural cooperative cadres and mobilize agricultural cooperatives with surplus cattle power to voluntarily sell a batch of strong cattle (which can be matched with small cattle) to support cattle-deficient areas. This can save agricultural cooperatives in cattle-producing areas a portion of the feeding costs, which is also beneficial to increasing income.
  After winter planting, it is a relatively idle season for draft cattle, and it is also a good time to regulate draft cattle. If we procrastinate and miss the winter, it will be too late to address the regulation of draft cattle when spring plowing arrives next year.

    调剂耕牛的好时机
    高长任
    从1954年洞庭湖附近各县遭受严重水灾以后，湖南省就感到牛力不足。去冬今春，湖南省供销合作社曾在外省和本省内收购了二万八千多头耕牛，支援缺牛地区。但是滨湖地区仍然缺牛。今年春季农忙的时候，南县、安乡、沅江等县不得不组织大批人力来拉犁。仅安乡县，就有三万多人从事这种繁重的劳动。据常德专区初步计划，今冬明春需要购进四万头耕牛，才能满足农业社明年春耕时的需要。
    在今年夏、秋之间，湖南省供销社曾派出工作组作了许多典型调查。调查材料证明，全省耕牛耕地数量很不平衡。在缺牛的湖区，一头牛全年平均要耕作六十亩以上，而在产牛的山区，很多农业社每头牛只耕作十几亩到二十亩。总的情况是湖区缺牛，山区有余牛，丘陵地区的耕牛基本上自给。如果能合理地在省内调剂一下，湖区缺牛问题是可以得到基本解决的。
    根据这个情况，湖南省供销社现在正在积极准备组织耕牛的调剂工作。供销社已制定了今冬明春在省内调剂五万头耕牛的计划。全省基本实现高级农业合作化后，耕牛交易已由分散变为集中。供销社准备适应这种情况改进工作方法。在各地将要配备专职干部，组织和领导固有的耕牛市场，合理调整地区差价和季节差价，促使耕牛自然流转，鼓励农业社繁殖耕牛。要完成省内调剂五万头耕牛的计划，还是有不少困难的。当前最主要的问题，是产牛区的农业社不但不愿意出售可以出售的耕牛，而且尽量想办法购进壮牛；但是对于入社的小牛，却仍然当作“包袱”，或者折价时压低价格，或者入社后又贱价出卖。因此，要把耕牛调剂好，光靠供销社的经济工作，是很难办到的。有必要对农业社干部进行教育，动员牛力有余的农业社自愿出售一批壮牛（可以搭配小牛），支援缺牛地区。这可以使产牛地区的农业社节省一部分饲养成本，对增加收入也是有利的。
  冬种之后，便是耕牛较闲的季节，也是调剂耕牛的适当时机。如果因循蹉跎，错过了冬季，到明年春耕时再抓调剂耕牛这件事，可就晚了。
