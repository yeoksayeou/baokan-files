    On Decency
    Jun Yi
    This is something I heard someone say:
    A journalist from a people's democratic country came to visit a department of a local Chinese Communist Party organization in our area. The Party committee organization was housed in an old building, and the paint on the floorboards had completely peeled off. The comrade receiving him felt a little uneasy about this. Unexpectedly, at the end of the visit, the journalist expressed being deeply moved by the building. He earnestly said: "I didn't expect the Chinese Party to live in such a house, for the ruling party to be so simple!"
    Another incident I personally experienced:
    At a banquet, several of us female comrades were at the same table with a foreign female guest. This guest smiled and said to us: "Every Chinese woman I've seen is beautiful. But..." She made a turn: "If you could pay more attention to dressing, you would be even more beautiful." Then she said: In their country, there are many magazines that focus on women's fashion, specifically teaching women how to choose fabrics, how to apply rouge, curl their hair... We Chinese female comrades exchanged smiles (of course, we were all wearing our most beautiful clothes that day). Naturally, we explained a few words at the time. But now that I think about it, I feel that it is an honor for us Chinese women, especially senior Chinese intellectual women, to appear simple in the eyes of foreigners. It is truly our honor to not distance ourselves from the living standards of our people, and to not be extravagant and flashy! It's just a pity that we haven't been able to fully achieve this yet.
    Our people have always respected plainness and simplicity, and disliked extravagance. Those who hold high positions and are able to live in thatched huts and earthen steps, and wear old clothes, have always been written about in primers for children to learn from. Only those decadent rulers and treacherous ministers of subjugated nations, such as Emperor Yang of Sui and Jia Sidao, specially focused on pomp and circumstance, treating grand displays as a matter of decency. "Red hats hum, black hats holler, the master sits in a sedan chair watching plum blossoms..." such entourages have merely become laughing stocks in people's stories for many years.
    Shouldn't we think about these things?
    In daily life, is it really a decent thing to compete with others, with foreigners, in clothing, shoes, hats, and household utensils?
    On holidays, are long lines of public cars parked in front of parks and theaters where there are no meetings really a decent thing?
    Don't think these are small things, don't resent those who like to be critical. It's all for socialism! Everyone knows this. In some occasions of emphasizing extravagance and wanting pomp and decency, we can also understand that the motivations are not all unclean. However, decency and indecency originally depend on how people view it. And truly insightful people will see what is truly glorious and truly worthy of being moved, and what is not so decent. The words of the journalist quoted earlier are an example.
    (I hereby solemnly declare that what this short article criticizes has absolutely nothing to do with the enjoyment of wearing floral cotton clothes and eating sweets by young students and workers, so as to avoid some people who are particularly sensitive to the actions of young people from linking these issues to them again.)

    论体面
    君宜
    这是我听人家讲的一件事：
    一个人民民主国家的记者来访问我们某地中共地方组织的一个部门。这个党委机关住的是一幢旧楼房，楼板上的油漆都剥落完了。接待的同志为这很感到点不安。不料，这位记者在访问结束的时候却表示为这幢楼房所深深感动。他恳切地说：“我想不到中国党能住这样的房子，当权的政党能这样朴素！”
    另一件是我亲身经历的：
    在一个宴会里我们几个女同志和一位外国的女宾同席。这位女宾笑着对我们说：“我所见到的中国妇女，还没有一个长得不美的。但是……”她转了一个弯子：“如果你们能在装饰上再讲究些，那就更美了。”于是她说：在她们国家里，有不少讲究妇女时装的杂志，专教妇女怎样选衣料、怎样涂胭脂、卷头发……。我们几个中国女同志相视一笑（当然，那天我们事实上已经都穿了各人最漂亮的衣裳）。当时自然也解释了几句。但是现在想来，我却觉得：我们中国妇女，尤其是中国的高级知识妇女，能在外国人的眼里看来是朴素的，这正是我们的光荣。我们能不远离我们的人民的生活水平，不奢靡浮华，这真是我们的光荣！所惜我们还并未能完全做到这样罢了。
    我国的人民一向就敬重淡泊朴素，讨厌铺张。身居高位而能住茅茨土阶、穿旧衣服的人，从来总是被写在幼学读本上给孩子们学习的。只有那些亡国的昏君奸相，像隋炀帝、贾似道之类，才专门讲究排场，把排场大当做体面事。“红帽哼兮黑帽呵，老爷坐轿看梅花……”这样的前呼后拥，只不过成了多少年来人们传说的笑柄。
    我们不该想一想这些事吗？
    日常生活中，在衣服鞋帽、起居器用上和别人、和外国人比赛，难道真是一件体面的事？
    假日，在并无任何会议的公园和剧场门口，排着一长列一长列的公家小汽车，难道真是一件体面的事？
    别觉得这是小事，别讨厌爱说话的人挑眼罢。都是为了社会主义嘛！这谁都知道。在有些场合里的讲铺张、要排场体面，我们也能体谅那动机并不都是不干净的。可是，体面与不体面，这本来在于人们怎么看法。而真正有见识的人，是会看出什么才是真正光荣、真正值得感动的事，什么事则是并不怎么体面的。前面引述的那位记者的话，就是一例。
    （我这篇短文所指摘的，与青年学生、职工的穿花棉衣吃糖果之类享受，完全无关，特此郑重声明，以免有些对青年的举动特别敏感的人又要把这些问题往他们身上联系。）
