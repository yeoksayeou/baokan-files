Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: According to TASS, Paris, 9th dispatch: The French fascists' bandit-like attacks on the French Communist Party Central Committee office and the Democratic Newspaper office have aroused widespread anger and protests from the French working people.

"L'Humanité" published on the 9th a long list of Parisian enterprises whose employees held short strikes demanding severe punishment for the unscrupulous thugs. Short strikes were also held in enterprises in the suburbs of Paris and in cities in various provinces.

On the 8th, mass rallies and demonstrations were held in many cities such as Marseille, Tours, Amiens, and Tarbes. In Marseille, several thousand enterprise workers and dockworkers overwhelmed the fascists' demonstration.

The working people of Tours prevented the sabotage of the fascist thugs' local organizations. These bad elements originally attempted to organize provocative demonstrations in front of the Communist Party office. The working people shouted in unison, "Fascism won't work," and drove away the reactionaries.

In a call to the working people of the country, the French General Confederation of Labor pointed out that the fascists were hoping for a split in the working class, and therefore the General Confederation called on the working people to hold a national anti-fascist struggle day on November 13, organizing demonstrations, mass rallies, and short strikes to show the unity of the working people.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: TASS, Rome, 9th dispatch: Due to the fascists' attack on the headquarters of the French Communist Party Central Committee and the "L'Humanité" newspaper office, Italian workers expressed their support for the French Communist Party. Sending telegrams to the leading organs of the French Communist Party were: the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, the Secretariat of the Italian Socialist Party, the Communist parliamentary groups of the Italian Chamber of Deputies and Senate, and many trade union organizations affiliated with the Italian General Confederation of Labor. Many enterprises in Italy convened various mass gatherings, at which resolutions were passed protesting the bandit-like attacks by French reactionaries.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: TASS, Rome, 10th dispatch: The Italian working people angrily condemned the provocative acts of the French reactionary forces in attacking progressive organizations.

According to "Unità" newspaper, 80,000 people in Bologna held an anti-fascist mass rally, expressing their support for the French Communist Party and protesting the thugs' attack on the French Communist Party Central Committee office and the "L'Humanité" newspaper office.

Workers in many factories in Milan also held mass rallies to support the French Communist Party.
