Xinhua News Agency, Baoding Electric Dispatch: The Hebei Province Livestock Production Conference, recently held, decided that the province will increase hog raising by more than 1,270,000 in 1957. Including the originally raised pigs, by the end of 1957, the total number of pigs raised in Hebei Province will reach 6 million.

Hebei Province is one of the provinces in our country with a large number of pigs raised. Although seven special districts in Hebei Province suffered from varying degrees of flooding this year, it is estimated that by the end of this year, the total number of pigs raised in the province will still increase by about 800,000 compared to last year.

The meeting specifically analyzed the favorable conditions and objective difficulties for developing pig raising in various places, and exchanged experiences in pig raising. Everyone unanimously believed that after the advanced cooperative transformation, the favorable conditions for raising pigs have increased. As long as the relevant departments earnestly help the masses open up feed sources, prevent and control pig diseases, promote good pig raising experiences, and stipulate reasonable methods for purchasing hogs, it is entirely possible to complete next year's pig raising plan.

    河北省畜牧生产会议决定
    明年增养毛猪一百二十多万只
    据新华社保定电　最近举行的河北省畜牧生产会议决定全省1957年增养毛猪一百二十七万多只。包括原来饲养的猪在内，到1957年底，河北省养猪总数将达到六百万只。
    河北省是我国养猪较多的省份之一。今年河北省虽有七个专区遭受了不同程度的水灾，但是，预计到今年年底，全省养猪总数仍将比去年增加八十万只左右。
    会议具体分析了各地发展养猪的有利条件和客观困难，交流了养猪经验。大家一致认为，高级合作化以后，养猪的有利条件增多了，只要有关部门认真帮助群众开辟饲料来源、防治猪病、推广好的养猪经验，并规定合理的收购毛猪的办法，完成明年的养猪计划是完全可能的。
