    New-Style Grinding Machine
    The crankshafts for the Liberation brand automobiles shipped from Changchun yesterday completed their processing trials on the domestically produced, Soviet-style "3421" crankshaft grinding machine, test-manufactured by the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant. The test results proved that the precision of the automobile crankshafts processed with this new type of domestically produced grinding machine can reach an accuracy of one-hundredth of a millimeter, and the quality fully meets the requirements.
    The "3421" crankshaft grinding machine is the first new product trial-manufactured by the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant in excess of the twenty-two new products stipulated by the Five-Year Plan, which they completed ahead of schedule. Its operation is semi-automated, and it can process one automobile crankshaft every twenty minutes. In an automobile factory with an annual output of 30,000 trucks, two such grinding machines can meet the entire crankshaft grinding needs.
    The workers of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant are also trial-manufacturing another type of crankshaft grinding machine and a cylindrical grinding machine. They are striving to produce three more new grinding machines than the new product plan stipulated by the First Five-Year Plan by the end of this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新式磨床
    从长春运来的解放牌汽车的曲轴，昨天在上海机床厂试制的仿苏式“三四二一”型曲轴磨床上结束了加工试验。试验的结果证明，用这种国产的新型磨床加工的汽车曲轴，精密度可以达到不差一公丝，质量完全符合要求。
    “三四二一”型曲轴磨床是上海机床厂提前完成了五年计划规定的二十二种新产品以后，超额试制的第一种新产品。它的操作是半自动化的，每二十分钟就可以加工一根汽车曲轴。在年产三万辆载重汽车的汽车厂里，两台这样的磨床就可以满足全部曲轴磨削的需要。
    上海机床厂的职工还正在试制另外一种曲轴磨床和一种外圆磨床。他们争取在今年年底前比第一个五年计划规定的新品种计划多出产三种新磨床。　（新华社）
