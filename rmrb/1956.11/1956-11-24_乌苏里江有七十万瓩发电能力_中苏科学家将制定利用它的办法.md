Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: According to a TASS report: Chinese and Soviet scientists have conducted three joint surveys of the Ussuri River and its tributaries on the Sino-Soviet border. The results of the survey proved that six regulating reservoirs can be built on this river. The total power generation capacity of the hydropower stations built on these reservoirs will reach 700,000 kilowatts.

In addition, they also collected materials for formulating the construction of a cascade of hydropower stations on the Suifen River, which flows through China and the Soviet Union.

The Ussuri River has very unique water characteristics, and it can cause great losses to the national economies of China and the Soviet Union during floods. At present, a comprehensive survey team jointly formed by Chinese and Soviet scientists is investigating and studying this river in order to formulate methods for utilizing it.

    乌苏里江有七十万瓩发电能力
    中苏科学家将制定利用它的办法
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社报道：中国和苏联的科学家已经对中苏交界的乌苏里江和它的支流进行了三次联合考察。考察的结果证明，在这条河流上可以建筑六个调节水库。在这些水库上建筑的水电站的总发电能力将达七十万瓩。
    此外，他们还收集了关于制定在流经中苏两国的绥芬河上建设水电站阶梯的材料。
    乌苏里江的水性非常独特，它在涨水的时候能够给中苏两国的国民经济带来极大的损失。目前，由中苏科学家联合组成的综合考察队正在考察研究这条河流，以制定出利用它的办法。
