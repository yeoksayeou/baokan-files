Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from New York: At the United Nations General Assembly meeting on the morning of the 16th, the United States, using its manipulated mechanical majority, once again obstructed the inclusion of the issue of China's representation on the agenda of the General Assembly.

When voting on the amendment proposed by the Indian representative to the first point of the General Committee's resolution, representatives from twenty-five countries voted in favor of the Indian proposal. These countries were: Hungary, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sudan, Sweden, Syria, Ukraine, USSR, Yemen, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Albania, Bulgaria, Burma, Byelorussia, Cambodia, Ceylon, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, Finland. Representatives from nine countries abstained: Israel, Jordan, Laos, Lebanon, Libya, Mexico, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia. The United States, Britain, France, Italy, Brazil, Thailand, the Philippines, Canada and forty-five other delegations voted against it.

The result of the vote on the second part of the Indian proposal to the General Committee resolution was: twenty-four votes in favor, forty-seven votes against, and eight abstentions. Cambodia, which initially voted in favor, changed its vote to abstain; Lebanon and Mexico, which initially abstained, changed their votes to against.

The debate on the issue of China's representation in the United Nations in recent days shows that the US position has been supported by Britain and some Commonwealth countries such as Australia. People outside the United Nations meetings pointed out that Britain is doing this to gain US public support for its aggression against Egypt.

The debate surrounding the issue of China's representation and the final voting results on this issue also illustrate that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the United States to realize its conspiracy to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate status in the United Nations. The Associated Press said that the debate on this issue "dragged on much longer than usual at the General Assembly." At last year's General Assembly, twelve countries supported the proposal to discuss China's representation issue, while this year, the number of countries advocating discussion of China's representation issue has greatly increased.

During the debate on this issue at the morning meeting on the 16th, representatives from Hungary, Sudan, and Syria all spoke in support of the Indian proposal. Syrian representative Zeineddine said that the motives of those who neither recognize the People's Republic of China nor want to see its representatives in the United Nations are still understandable; however, it is difficult to explain the attitude of those who have recognized the government of the People's Republic of China, while at the same time making every effort to obstruct the restoration of its legitimate seat in the United Nations.

The French representative repeated the so-called "the time is not yet ripe" argument for discussing this issue, which the British representative made at the meeting on the 15th.

Iranian representative Ardalan admitted that the General Committee's resolution exceeded its authority, but he said that he agreed with its resolution.

Indian representative Menon made a long speech, in which he sternly refuted all kinds of "arguments" put forward to obstruct the discussion of the issue of China's representation. He also fiercely criticized US representative Lodge's unreasonable attack on India at the evening meeting on the 15th. In that speech, Nolan described India as the "main speaker" in the Soviet Union's movement to restore China's seat.

Menon demanded that Lodge "publicly or privately apologize" for Nolan's speech. He said that Nolan's speech was an act of insulting the delegation of another UN member state. Such talk is a major impediment to international friendship. He asked Nolan to "see a doctor or a psychiatrist" for his hostile behavior towards China.

Menon concluded by saying that he believed that those who still so stubbornly ignore ironclad realities will soon be forced to abandon this unrealistic attitude. His speech aroused warm applause.

After some disgusting and ugly performances by Peruvian representative Belaúnde and Chiang Kai-shek elements, the meeting proceeded to a vote. Under US manipulation and pressure, the meeting rejected India's amendment to the General Committee's resolution.

    在美国操纵和压力下
    中国代表权问题未列入联大议程
    梅农指斥美国代表敌视中国的行为
    新华社17日讯　纽约消息：在联合国大会16日上午会议上，美国利用它所操纵的机械多数再一次阻挠把中国代表权问题列入大会议程。
    在就印度代表对总务委员会的决议案的第一点提出的修正案进行表决时，有二十五个国家的代表投票支持印度提案，这些国家是：匈牙利、印度、印度尼西亚、尼泊尔、挪威、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏丹、瑞典、叙利亚、乌克兰、苏联、也门、南斯拉夫、阿富汗、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、缅甸、白俄罗斯、柬埔寨、锡兰、捷克斯洛伐克，丹麦、埃及、芬兰。九个国家的代表弃权，他们是：以色列、约旦、老挝、黎巴嫩、利比亚、墨西哥、葡萄牙、沙特阿拉伯、突尼斯。美国、英国、法国、意大利、巴西、泰国、菲律宾、加拿大等四十五个代表团投反对票。
    印度对总务委员会决议案第二部分的提案的表决结果是：二十四票赞成，四十七票反对，八票弃权。第一次投赞成票的柬埔寨改投了弃权票；第一次投弃权票的黎巴嫩和墨西哥改投了反对票。
    几天来在联合国里进行的关于中国代表权问题的辩论表明，美国的立场受到了英国和像澳大利亚等一部分英联邦国家的支持。联合国会议外的人士指出，英国所以这样作是要换取美国对它侵略埃及的行动的公开支持。
    围绕着中国代表权问题进行的辩论和关于这个问题的最后表决结果也说明，美国要实现它阻挠恢复中国在联合国的合法地位的阴谋是越来越困难了。美联社说，关于这个问题的辩论“在大会上拖得比往常要长得多”。在去年大会上，支持讨论中国代表权问题的提案的有十二个国家，而在今年，主张讨论中国代表权问题的国家是大大增加了。
    在16日上午会议辩论这个问题时，匈牙利、苏丹和叙利亚的代表都发言支持印度的提案。叙利亚代表宰尼丁说，有人既不承认中华人民共和国，也不愿意在联合国里看到它的代表，这种人的动机还是可以理解的；可是，有人既已承认中华人民共和国政府，同时却又竭力阻挠恢复它在联合国的合法席位，这种人的态度无论如何是难以解释的。
    法国代表重复了英国代表在15日会议上发表的所谓讨论这个问题的“时机还没有成熟”的论调。
    伊朗代表安迪让承认总务委员会的决议超越了它的权限，但是他又说他赞成它的决议。
    印度代表梅农作了长篇发言，他严正驳斥了为阻挠讨论中国代表权问题而提出的形形色色的“论点”。他还猛烈抨击美国代表诺兰在15日晚间会议上对印度的无理攻击，诺兰在他那次发言里把印度说成是苏联争取恢复中国席位的运动的“主要发言人”。
    梅农要求洛奇为诺兰的发言“公开或者是私下表示道歉”。他说，诺兰的发言是犯了侮辱另一个联合国成员国代表团的罪行。这种谈话是对国际友好的一个重大妨害。他要求诺兰为他的敌视中国的行为而“去看看医生或者是精神病医生”。
    梅农最后说，他相信，那些直到现在还如此固执地无视铁一般的现实的人，将很快被迫放弃这种不现实的态度。他的发言引起了热烈的掌声。
    在秘鲁代表贝朗德和蒋介石分子作了一些令人发呕的丑恶表演后，会议进行表决。在美国的操纵和压力下，会议否决了印度对总务委员会决议的修正案。
