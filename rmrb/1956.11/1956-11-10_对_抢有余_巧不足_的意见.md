    Opinions on “‘Grasping’ Has Excess, ‘Skill’ is Insufficient”
    After reading the article “‘Grasping’ Has Excess, ‘Skill’ is Insufficient” published in the People's Daily on August 6th, I have some different opinions. I think this article is very one-sided.
    The textile industry system has promoted many advanced experiences in the advanced producer movement. In addition to the advanced experiences summarized and promoted by various regions themselves, more than 400 items were collected and introduced at the National Textile Industry Advanced Producers Conference. Among these many advanced experiences, some may still have shortcomings, but the author believes that most of them have some common shortcomings, that is, "'grasping' has excess, 'skill' is insufficient," that is, they all rely on increasing labor intensity. This is an exaggeration and vague statement.
    Take the "untwisting and joining method" promoted in the spinning workshop as an example. The strength of this joining method is higher than any original joining method. It is not "even undetectable with precision instruments." According to the single yarn strength test of Beijing State-owned Cotton Factory No. 2, the average strength of the untwisting joint is 316.8 grams, and the average strength of the flat joint is 206.7 grams.
    The author also said that the untwisting joint requires bending over to join, which is very inconvenient and strenuous for pregnant women and tall people, which is also inaccurate. Like other joining methods, the "untwisting joining method" does not require bending over. If a person is tall and the machine is short, and bending over is required, flat joining and other joining methods also require bending over. This is not a shortcoming of the untwisting joining method itself. At the same time, the untwisting joining method does not require workers to see whether the twist on each yarn is completely untwisted, as the author said. Generally, skilled workers can untwist it with just a movement of two fingers.
    In terms of operation time, because the untwisting joint has one more action, the time is slightly extended. According to measurements, the average "untwisting joint" of Zhang Meilan, a national advanced producer representative, is 4.31 seconds, and the average "flat joint" of Shanghai State-owned Cotton Factory No. 11 is 3.91 seconds, a difference of 0.4 seconds. The impact is not significant. It will not, as the author said, "keep workers busy with joining all day long," nor will it "distract the energy of patrol cleaning work."
    Another opinion of the author is that "from the perspective of the entire production process, the spinning workshop mainly strengthens patrol and does more cleaning work to reduce broken ends." This is also worth discussing. Spinning workers should of course master patrol and rationally arrange cleaning work, but it is not comprehensive if they only pay attention to patrol and cleaning and do not pay attention to the basic operations of spinning workers such as joining and changing roving. From the perspective of the entire production process, improving the joining method is of great significance, because the quality of spinning joints directly affects the broken ends and defects of the rear engineering (winding, warping, weaving, etc.). Comrade Kovalev said when he visited the "untwisting joint" at the Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill: Although the spinning joint time is slightly longer, the broken ends of the rear engineering are reduced, and the total time is still saved.
    Recently, the Ministry of Textile Industry and the National Committee of the Textile Trade Union organized 18 national textile industry advanced producer representatives to hold advanced experience learning classes in areas where textile enterprises are concentrated to disseminate 16 advanced experiences (including untwisting joints), which were welcomed by the majority of employees. It is wrong to say that the common shortcoming of these experiences is to increase the labor intensity of workers, and the trick is just a "grasping" character.
    It can be seen that the author's statement that the promotion of these advanced experiences has increased unpleasant accidents such as work-related injuries, diseases, absenteeism, and miscarriages of female workers is also unbelievable. The author listed the miscarriage figures of Shanghai State-owned Cotton Factory No. 5. May I ask if it has been investigated? It seems very convincing, but which advanced experiences have been promoted by Factory No. 5? Which of these experiences caused these unpleasant things? If the blame is indiscriminately and generally attributed to the promotion of advanced experiences in the textile industry system, it can only obscure people's understanding and will not do any good to the promotion of advanced experiences or the prevention of the occurrence of "unpleasant events."
    Many advanced experiences are not perfect and need to be studied and discussed in all aspects, but only with a basis and a realistic attitude can we help each other and improve together.

### 对“‘抢’有余‘巧’不足”的意见

专栏：读报杂感

    对“‘抢’有余‘巧’不足”的意见
    读了8月6日人民日报发表的“‘抢’有余‘巧’不足”一文，有些不同的看法，我认为这篇文章是有很大的片面性的。
    纺织工业系统在先进生产者运动中，推广了不少先进经验。除了各个地区自己总结推广的以外，光在全国纺织工业先进生产者会议上集中起来整理介绍的就有四百多项。其中属于运转操作方面的先进经验，确定在全国普遍推广的有二十二项。这许多先进经验，有一些可能还有缺点，但作者认为其中大部分都有一些共同的缺点，就是“抢”有余“巧”不足，也就是说都是靠增加劳动强度的。这未免是夸大的含糊其词的说法。
    就拿细纱车间推广的“解拈接头法”来说，这个接头法比原来任何接头法的强力都要提高，并不是“甚至用精密仪器也测不出来”的。根据北京国棉二厂单纱强力的试验，解拈接头强力平均为三百一十六点八克，平接头平均为二百○六点七克。
    作者又说解拈接头要弯下腰去接，对孕妇和高个子非常不便，非常吃力，也是不确切的。“解拈接头法”和其他接头法一样，并不需要弯腰，如果个子高，机器矮，需要弯腰的话，平接头和别的接头方法也一样要弯腰，这并不是解拈接头法本身的缺点。同时解拈接头法也并没有像作者所说的要求工人看清楚每一根细纱上的拈度是不是完全解开，一般操作熟练的工人只要两个手指一动，就可解开了。
    在操作时间上，因为解拈接头多一个动作，时间有所延长，根据测定，全国先进生产者代表张梅兰，“解拈接头”平均是4.31秒，上海国棉十一厂“平接头”平均是3.91秒，相差0.4秒。影响并不大。不致像作者所说的“使工人成天忙于接头”，也不致“分散巡回清洁工作的精力”。
    作者另一意见，认为“从整个生产过程来看，细纱车间主要是加强巡回，多做清洁工作以减少断头”。这也是值得商榷的。细纱工人当然要掌握巡回、合理安排清洁工作，但如果仅仅注意巡回和清洁，不注意细纱工人的接头，换粗纱等基本操作，也是不全面的。从整个生产过程来看，改进接头方法，却有很多意义，因为细纱接头质量的好坏直接影响后部工程（络筒整经、织布等）的断头和疵点。郭瓦廖夫同志在北京清河制呢厂参观“解拈接头”时就说过：虽然细纱接头时间稍有延长，但后部工程断头减少，总的时间还是节省了。
    最近纺织工业部和纺织工会全国委员会组织了十八名全国纺织工业先进生产者代表，在各个纺织企业集中的地区举办先进经验学习班，传播十六项先进经验（包括解拈接头），受到广大职工的欢迎。说这些经验共同的缺点是增加工人劳动强度，其窍门仅仅是一个“抢”字，那是不对的。
    由此可见，作者说由于推广这些先进经验，增加了工伤事故、疾病、缺勤、女工流产等不愉快的事故的说法也是不能令人相信的。作者列举上海国棉五厂的流产数字，试问是否经过调查？好像很有说服力，可是究竟五厂推广了那些先进经验？究竟那些经验的推广造成了这些不愉快的事情？如果不加区别的笼统的归罪于纺织工业系统推广先进经验，只能是模糊人们的认识，对推广先进经验或者是防止“不愉快的事件”的产生都没有什么好处。
    很多先进经验，都还不是十全十美的，需要各方面来研究讨论，但只有有根据的，持实事求是的态度，才能互相帮助，共同提高。
