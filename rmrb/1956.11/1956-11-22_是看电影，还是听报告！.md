    Watching a Movie or Listening to a Report!
    On the evening of October 30th, the mobile film projection team gave a movie show to the farmers in Xiaqiao Village, Sixi District, Taishun County, Zhejiang Province. The film was "Qin Xianglian." When the farmers heard this news, they spread it as a great happy event. We cadres who have been working in rural areas for a long time were of course also very happy. At around six o'clock, the engine's motor roared, and the audience focused their attention on the screen, waiting for the screening. An cadre, we don't know where from, suddenly walked to the front of the audience and started giving a report. The content of the report was about the autumn harvest distribution, "secondly" followed by "secondly," and "supplement" followed by "supplement," talking non-stop. We counted, there were a total of twelve "secondly's" and nine "supplements." An hour passed before people could catch their breath. Who knew that the report was not over yet, followed by lengthy speeches on health work, the varieties and prices of agricultural by-products, etc. It was almost nine o'clock before the movie started showing. We ask, is this really letting everyone watch a movie or listen to a report?

    是看电影，还是听报告！
    10月30日晚上，电影巡回放映队在浙江省泰顺县泗溪区下桥村给农民放映电影，影片是“秦香莲”。农民听到了这个消息，都把它当作极大的喜事传开来，我们长期作农村工作的干部，当然也十分欢喜。六时左右，发动机的马达就发出轰隆的响声，观众都聚精会神地注视着银幕，等待着放映。不知道那里来的一位干部，突然走到了观众面前，作起报告来了。报告的内容是秋收的分配情况，“其次”接着“其次”，“补充”接着“补充”，滔滔不绝。我们统计了一下，共有十二个“其次”，九个“补充”。一个钟头过去了，人们才喘了一口气。谁知道报告还没有到此结束，接着又来了个卫生工作、农业副产品的品种、价格等长篇演说，快到九点钟了，电影才开始放映。试问，这究竟是让大家看电影还是听报告？
