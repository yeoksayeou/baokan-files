For a long time, people have often used fire to explain life. When a person is alive, the body is warm, and it becomes cold after death. This common phenomenon led people to imagine that life is like fire, and the extinction of the fire of life is death. "Heaven cannot develop all things without this fire, and man cannot nourish the root of life without this fire." This is an ancient Chinese saying. Ancient Greek scholars had similar views. But at that time, people did not understand fire, let alone life.

Another sign of death is the cessation of breathing. A person suffocates if locked in an enclosed box, and a fire goes out if confined in an enclosed container. Before the discovery of oxygen, many scholars explored the relationship between combustion and respiration, but they did not get the correct answer.

Combustible materials are not limited to organic matter, so it is inappropriate to use fire to explain the characteristics of life, but the study of fire opened the door to the study of life.

In the seventeenth century, the "phlogiston theory" prevailed. Chemists at that time believed that there was a component in combustible materials called "phlogiston." Combustion was the release of "phlogiston" from combustible materials, leaving ash. Under the influence of this theory, physiologists believed that there was an invisible fire burning inside the human body, constantly releasing "phlogiston." They noticed that people's breath turned into mist in winter. They said that the mist-like substance was "phlogiston."

Oxygen was discovered in 1772 by the Swede Scheele and in 1774 by the Englishman Priestley. But although they discovered oxygen, they did not know that oxygen existed in the air, so they did not understand the relationship between oxygen and combustion. It was the French chemist Lavoisier who proved that oxygen is the main component of air and completely overturned the "phlogiston" theory. It turned out that combustion was not the release of "phlogiston" by combustible materials, but the combination of combustible materials with oxygen. "Phlogiston" simply did not exist. From this discovery, the correct way to explain respiration was found. Inhaling oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide and water is the process of respiration. This common knowledge, which is now known to everyone, was indeed an epoch-making discovery in biological science.

With the development of chemistry and biological science, people have understood the properties of oxygen and its role in living organisms, and therefore understand how to use oxygen to serve human health.

People must use oxygen when flying in airplanes at high altitudes. The higher the altitude, the thinner the air and the lower the air pressure. Generally speaking, above an altitude of three thousand meters above sea level, people begin to feel uncomfortable. Above five thousand meters, many people find it unbearable if they do not inhale additional oxygen. Without inhaling additional oxygen, no one can persist in flying above eight thousand meters.

No part of the human body tissue does not need oxygen. The brain is the first to be affected when oxygen is lacking. When flying at high altitudes, the pilot must first inhale additional oxygen; otherwise, the function of his brain will be reduced, and his eyes and hands will not be able to function freely.

By using pressure and cooling, oxygen can be condensed into liquid. In the future, when people travel to other planets, they must carry this liquid with them.

After oxygen is inhaled into the lungs, it is transported throughout the body by the blood. Hemoglobin in red blood cells is responsible for carrying oxygen. That is to say, oxygen and hemoglobin combine easily. But there is another gas that combines very easily with hemoglobin, and that is carbon monoxide, a component of coal gas. If carbon monoxide enters a person's blood and occupies a lot of hemoglobin, taking the place of oxygen, the person will be poisoned. Due to the lack of oxygen in the body, it can even lead to death. The way to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning is to prevent carbon monoxide from staying indoors; the way to treat carbon monoxide poisoning is to provide fresh air or pure oxygen.

When a patient has circulatory or respiratory problems, the greatest threat to life is insufficient oxygen in the body. At this time, it is not enough to just inhale the oxygen in the air, one must inhale pure oxygen. Thanks to oxygen therapy, many critically ill patients can overcome life's difficulties. Pure oxygen is usually compressed and stored in steel cylinders. When used, a rubber tube connected to the steel cylinder is inserted into the patient's nostrils for the patient to inhale. Oxygen can also be continuously delivered to a tent, allowing the patient to sit or lie in the tent and breathe.

    谈养气的功能
    穆晨
    很早以前，人们常常用火来解释生命。人在生存的时候身体是温暖的，死后就变冷。这个普通的现象使人设想：生命和火一样，生命之火的熄灭，就是死亡。“天非此火，不能发育万物，人非此火，不能生养命根。”这是中国古代的说法。古代希腊的学者也有类似的见解。但当时人们不理解火，更不理解生命。
    死亡的另一标志是呼吸停止。人如果关在密闭的箱子里会闷死，火如果关在密闭的器具里会熄灭。在养气没有被发现之前，很多学者就在探讨燃烧和呼吸的关系，但是得不到正确的解答。
    可燃的东西不仅限于有机物质，因此用火来说明生命的特征是不恰当的，可是火的研究给生命的研究打开了大门。
    十七世纪，盛行着一种“燃素说”。那时的化学家认为可燃的东西里面有一种成分，叫做“燃素”，燃烧就是可燃的东西放出“燃素”，留下灰烬。在这种学说影响之下，生理学家就认为人的身体里面有一种看不见的火在燃烧，也在不断放出“燃素”。他们注意到人在冬天的时候哈气成雾，他们说，那种雾状的东西就是“燃素”。
    养气是在1772年由瑞典人希雷，1774年由英国人普里斯特里发现的。但是他们虽然发现了养气，可是不知道养气在空气里面存在，因此还不明了养气和燃烧的关系。证明了养气是空气的主要成分，并且彻底推翻了“燃素”之说的是法国的化学家拉瓦西。原来燃烧不是可燃的东西放出什么“燃素”，而是可燃的东西与养气的化合。“燃素”是根本不存在的。从这个发现，才找到正确说明呼吸作用的途径。吸入养气，排出二养化碳和水，就是呼吸的过程。这个现在人所共知的常识，确曾是生物科学上一个划时代的发现。
    随着化学和生物科学的发展，人们懂得了养气的性能和养气在生物体内的作用，因此也就懂得了怎样利用养气为人类的健康服务。
    人在高空乘飞机飞行，必须利用养气。离地面愈高，空气也就愈稀薄，气压也就愈低。一般来说，超过拔海三千公尺的高度，人就开始有些不舒服的感觉。超过五千公尺，如果不另外吸入养气，很多人就会感到难以忍受。如果不另外吸入养气，谁也不能坚持八千公尺以上的飞行。
    人体组织，没有一部分不需要养气。养气缺少时，首先受到影响的是大脑。在高空飞行时，飞机师首先要另外吸入养气；不然的话，他的大脑的功能就会减退，他的眼和手就不能运用自如。
    用加压和冷却的办法，可以使养气凝缩成液体。将来，人到其他星球去旅行，必须把这种液体带在身边。
    养气吸入肺部以后，靠血液运输到全身。负责携带养气的是红血球里面的血红蛋白。也就是说，养气和血红蛋白很容易结合。可是另外还有一种气体，很容易和血红蛋白结合，那就是煤气——一养化碳。如果煤气到人的血液里面霸占了很多血红蛋白，夺去了养气的位置，人就会中毒，由于体内养气缺少，甚至起引死亡。防止煤气中毒的办法是不叫煤气留在室内；救治煤气中毒的办法是供给新鲜的空气或者纯粹的养气。
    当病人发生循环障碍或者呼吸障碍的时候，对生命最大的威胁是体内养气不足。这时仅仅吸入空气里面的养气是很不够的，必须吸入纯粹的养气。由于有了养气疗法，很多危急的病人得以渡过生命的难关。纯粹的养气平常是压缩保存在钢筒里面的，用时把连接钢筒的橡皮管插在病人的鼻孔里，供病人吸入。也可以把养气不断输送到一个帐幕里面，使病人坐卧在帐幕里面呼吸。
