    I am very happy to have this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Burma-China Friendship Association at the commemoration of the 90th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth.
    Dr. Sun Yat-sen, one of the greatest leaders of awakened Asia, is the symbol of Chinese nationalism. The national movement he initiated and led was closely linked to the national movement in India. When he was alive, Burma was part of India; therefore, Burma's national movement was also linked to the national movement he led. In fact, when he died, our country's first national leader, the late U Ottama, represented the All-India Muslim Conference and the General Council of Burmese Associations at his funeral in Guangzhou.
    After Dr. Sun's death, we carefully studied the doctrines he left to the Chinese people. Therefore, we were able to learn a lot from his doctrines. In 1937, the Nagani Publishing Club published a Burmese translation of Dr. Sun's "Three Principles of the People." U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, was the founder and chairman of the Nagani Publishing Club.
    The national movements of Burma and China have had close ties since very early on, and now they are united in friendship based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This development is very natural. Therefore, on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, friends, let us remember his doctrine of nationalism and solemnly swear to use nationalism to eliminate colonialism and to establish world peace based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
    Long live Burma-China friendship!
    Long live world peace!

### 缅甸中国友好协会主席  信波的讲话

    缅甸中国友好协会主席
    信波的讲话
    我感到非常高兴，有这个机会代表缅中友好协会在纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年的大会上讲话。
    已经觉醒的亚洲的最大的领袖之一孙中山先生是中国民族主义的标志。他所发起和领导的民族运动与印度的民族运动是密切联系在一起的。在他生时，缅甸是印度的一部分；因此，缅甸的民族运动也是同他所领导的民族运动联系在一起的。事实上，当他死的时候，我国的第一个民族领袖、已故的吴奥塔玛，曾经代表全印回民大会和缅甸各协会总理事会参加在广州举行的他的葬礼。
    孙先生死后，我们认真地研究他留给中国人民的学说。因此我们能从他的学说中得到不少的教益。1937年，纳甘尼出版俱乐部出版了孙先生的“三民主义”缅文译本。反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努就是纳甘尼出版俱乐部的创始人和主席。
    缅中两国的民族运动在很早以前就有密切的联系，而现在又根据和平共处的五项原则友好地团结起来。这种发展是很自然的。所以，在纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年的时候，朋友们，让我们牢记他的民族主义学说，并庄严地宣誓，要用民族主义来消灭殖民主义，并根据和平共处的五项原则来建立世界和平。
    缅中友好万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
