(Xinhua News Agency, Hailar) Three refrigerated railway cars carrying thirty-eight tons of frozen beef and mutton departed from the state-owned Hailar Meat Joint Processing Factory in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on October 31st, bound for the port of Tianjin. This is the first batch of frozen beef and mutton processed by this factory for Egypt. The remaining two hundred tons of finished products that have already been processed will be shipped out one after another in the coming days. According to the Egyptian order, this factory will process several hundred tons of frozen beef and mutton in early November.

According to Egyptian requirements, these beef and mutton products are all produced in accordance with Islamic dietary laws. During slaughter, two Imams from the Hailar Mosque perform the slaughtering. During the production process, workers pay special attention to cleanliness. Before loading the cars, the cars were scrubbed with hot water and lined with clean paper at the suggestion of the Imams. Finally, the Imams signed off on the departure.

    为埃及加工冻牛羊肉
    新华社海拉尔电　三节冷藏车厢装着三十八吨冻牛肉和冻羊肉，10月31日从内蒙古自治区国营海拉尔肉类联合加工厂开出运往天津港口。这是这个工厂为埃及加工的首批冻牛肉和冻羊肉。其余已经加工出的二百多吨成品，将在近日陆续出厂。根据埃及这一批定货任务，这个厂还将在11月上旬加工出几百吨冻牛肉和冻羊肉。
    根据埃及要求，这些牛、羊肉，都是按照伊斯兰教教规规定生产的。屠宰的时候，由海拉尔市清真寺的两位阿訇下刀。在生产过程中，工人们特别注意做到洁净。在装上车厢之前，按照阿訇提议，用热水刷洗了车厢，并铺上洁净的纸张。最后，由阿訇签字发车。
