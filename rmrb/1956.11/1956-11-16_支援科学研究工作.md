    With the development of our country's socialist cause, scientific research work is becoming increasingly important. Our Party and government are striving to create the necessary conditions for scientific research work, in order to realize the twelve-year plan for scientific development and strive to bring many important and urgently needed scientific and technological fields as close as possible to the world's advanced levels. We must rely on our own scientific and technological forces to solve major technical problems in industrial, agricultural, and national defense construction.

    At present, scientific research work has already obtained many convenient conditions, but there are still many difficulties. In terms of material conditions, many scientific departments' laboratories and libraries are not sufficient; many equipment, materials, books, and data for scientific research work cannot be fully supplied. In terms of manpower, there are still not enough scientific and technical personnel, and many scientific departments lack cadres and assistants for scientific organization work. These difficulties affect the implementation of scientific research plans to some extent.

    Of course, our country's socialist construction tasks are heavy and require huge amounts of resources. It is difficult to allocate a large amount of manpower and material resources to supply scientific departments outside of the plan. At the same time, some people hold a myopic view, thinking that scientific research is a work that does not produce results in the short term, and is something that can be done or not done, sooner or later. Therefore, the requests made by many scientific institutions and universities are often met with indifference, mutual buck-passing, and no one is responsible for solving them. For example, a certain research institution spent a great deal of effort to buy three bags of cement and one pound of glycerin, but still found it difficult to obtain them. This kind of example is probably not isolated, and it reflects the lack of sufficient understanding of scientific work by some people. This view must be corrected, and we must pay practical and serious attention to supporting scientific research work in all aspects.

    First of all, it is necessary to distinguish between the important and the urgent, and solve the difficult problems in scientific research work with emphasis, according to the principle of focusing on development. There are many categories of scientific research work, all of which are very useful and need to be developed diligently. However, because the state's financial and human resources are limited, if we use our strength equally, we will inevitably end up achieving nothing. Therefore, we must grasp the important and urgent parts, and try our best to meet their reasonable needs. Here, it should be affirmed that some departments have planned and deployed too many and too large scientific institutions, hoping to complete what should be done in twelve years in the first few years. This is not right. On the other hand, it should also be pointed out that if the most important and urgent projects in scientific research work have the conditions to be carried out but are not carried out diligently, and the time is delayed, this is extremely undesirable.

    According to a preliminary survey by a university, the most urgently needed equipment and reagents of the school amount to more than 4,000 kinds. Whether it is heavy machinery, precision instruments, or lead wire, angle iron, pig liver, or sheep bile, they are all needed for their research work. The relevant parties should practically and specifically help them solve these problems, without being bothered by complexity or trouble. Party and government leading organs and production and trade departments at all levels should treat supporting scientific research work as a new task, not only attaching importance to it ideologically, but also actively cooperating with them in their work. We should listen more to the voices and opinions of scientific workers, collect their useful suggestions, and learn about things that we are not familiar with. In particular, production and trade departments should seriously familiarize themselves with the working characteristics of scientific departments, take care of their special difficulties, and flexibly help them solve problems. Scientific research work itself has an exploratory nature, and some scientific departments and scientific research projects are newly established. Sometimes, they themselves cannot fully predict what experiments to do and what equipment they need; and when they need them, they are often impatient. At the same time, the equipment they need is often sporadic rather than in large quantities. Relevant production and trade departments should proactively take care of them in light of these characteristics and should not force them to rigidly abide by the supply system. For example, the regional supply system is necessary for the entire national construction, and it is appropriate to require most agencies to do so. However, when scientific research departments need certain equipment but cannot buy it locally, the regions that have this equipment should give special consideration and sell it to them. For example, foreign trade departments and some enterprises that produce scientific equipment can require general customers to order in batches, but scientific research departments should be allowed to order sporadically within the possible scope. Some sporadic equipment, although not on the production plan, should also be produced for them if possible. As for the enterprises that originally had cooperative relations with scientific departments, the relevant enterprise leading departments should actively assist them in restoring this cooperative relationship, and expand this cooperative relationship when necessary.

    In the future, at an appropriate time, national economic organs should consider formulating some effective systems to completely solve the problem of equipment supply to scientific departments.

    The national personnel departments should also speed up the allocation of a group of scientific organization work cadres and assistants to strengthen scientific research departments as much as possible. The problem that some scientists hold too many concurrent posts and participate in too many social activities should be solved quickly. At present, the central-level scientific departments stipulate fixed social activity time for scientists, and other time is at the disposal of scientists and must not be occupied. This method can be promoted.

    Scientific research institutions must clearly understand the state of national human and financial resources, organize their business well, learn to be careful in calculation, incorporate scientific career plans into the national plan, be good at using state help, take care of national difficulties, practice diligence and frugality, and maximize the effectiveness of limited talents and materials. After breaking the conservative tendencies, it is necessary to prevent the egalitarianism and rash advance tendencies that may exist in the work, and it is even more necessary to prevent the wasteful and extravagant atmosphere of spending money but not doing things, or spending more money and doing less things. The development plan of the work must be based on a solid and reliable foundation. We hope that our country's scientists can inherit the glorious tradition of hard struggle of our people in the years of revolutionary war, be good at overcoming difficulties, and work with workers and peasants to carry out creative labor under the conditions of insufficient manpower and equipment, and do more and better work.

    支援科学研究工作
    随着我国社会主义事业的发展，科学研究工作越来越显得重要了。我们的党和政府正在努力为科学研究工作创造必要的条件，以便实现科学发展的十二年规划，争取许多重要的急需的科学和技术部门尽快地接近世界先进水平，依靠我国本身的科学技术力量来解决工业、农业和国防建设中的重大技术问题。
    目前，科学研究工作已经取得了许多方便条件，但是困难也还不少。在物质条件方面，许多科学部门的试验室、图书馆等都不够用；进行科学研究工作的许多设备、器材、图书、资料还不能得到充分的供给。在人力方面，科学技术工作人员还很不够，不少科学部门还缺少科学组织工作的干部和助手。这些困难在某种程度上影响了科学研究计划的执行。
    当然，我国社会主义建设任务繁重，需用浩大，在计划以外，再抽调大量人力、物力供给科学部门是有困难的。同时，也有的抱着一种近视观点，以为科学研究是长期不见效果的工作，是可有可无可迟可早的工作。因此，有许多科学机关和高等学校提出的要求常常遭到冷遇，互相推脱，无人负责解决。例如某个研究机关为了买三袋水泥，一磅甘油，费了极大周折，尚不易到手。这种事例恐怕不是个别的，它反映了一部分人对科学工作缺乏足够的认识。这种观点必须加以纠正，必须从各个方面切实认真地注意支援科学研究工作。
    首先必须分别轻重缓急，按照重点发展的方针，有重点地解决科学研究工作中的困难问题。科学研究工作门类很多，都有很大的用处，都需要努力发展，但由于国家财力、人力是有限的，如果平均使用力量，势必落得一事无成。因此必须抓紧那种既重要而又紧急的部分，想尽办法，满足它们的合理需要。在这里，应当肯定，某些部门将科学机构设置计划部署得过多过大，希望把十二年内应做的事都放在前几年一气完成，这是不对的。另一方面也要指出，科学研究工作中最重要而又紧急的项目，如果有条件举办而不努力举办，耽误了时间，这是极不应该的。
    根据某一大学初步统计，该校最急需的器材和试剂就有四千多种，无论重型机器、精密仪表，以及铅丝、三角铁、猪肝、羊胆，都是他们进行研究工作所需要的。对于这些，各有关方面要切实具体地帮助他们解决，不要嫌复杂、怕麻烦。各级党政领导机关和生产、贸易部门，应当把支持科学研究工作，当作一项新的任务来进行，不仅要在思想上重视起来，而且要积极主动地配合他们进行工作。要多倾听科学工作者的呼声和意见，收集他们有益的建议，不熟悉的事情就要去学。尤其是生产、贸易部门，要认真熟悉科学部门的工作特点，照顾他们的特殊困难，灵活变通地帮助他们解决问题。科学研究工作本身具有探索性质，加之有些科学部门和科学研究项目是新建立起来的，要做什么试验，需要何种器材，有时他们自己也难以完全预计；而当他们要用的时候又往往迫不及待。同时，他们所需要的器材又往往是零星的而不是大批的。有关生产、贸易部门，针对这些特点，要主动地照顾他们，不要强求他们死板遵守供应制度。如分区供应制度，对整个国家建设来说是必要的，对大多数机关这样要求也是适当的，可是科学研究部门需要某些器材而又在当地买不到的时候，有这种器材的地区就应该特殊照顾，卖给他们。又如对外贸易部门和某些生产科学器材的企业，对一般主顾可以要求他们整批订购，而对科学研究部门就应当在可能范围内允许他们零星订购。有些零星器材，虽然生产计划上没有，但如果可能也应该为他们生产。至于原先同科学部门有协作关系的企业，有关企业领导部门要主动协助他们把这种协作关系恢复起来，必要时还可以扩大这种协作关系。
    今后在适当时期内，国家经济机关应考虑订出一些有效的制度，彻底解决对科学部门的器材供应问题。
    国家人事部门，也要尽可能加快调配一批科学组织工作干部和助手去充实科学研究部门。某些科学家兼职过多和社会活动过多的问题应当赶快解决。目前中央一级各科学部门，给科学家规定出固定的社会活动时间，其它时间都由科学家支配，不得侵占。这种办法可以推广。
    科学研究机关必须清楚地了解国家人力和财力的状况，组织好自己的业务，学会精打细算，把科学事业计划纳入国家计划轨道，善于使用国家帮助，照顾国家困难，勤俭节约，使有限的人才和物资发挥最大的效能。在打破保守倾向之后，必须防止工作中可能有的百端俱举的平均主义和冒进倾向，更必须防止只花钱不办事、多花钱少办事的浪费铺张风气。必须把工作的发展计划安置在扎实可靠的基础上。我们希望我国科学家能够继承我国人民在革命战争年代里的艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，善于克服困难，和工农群众一道，在人力设备还不充分的条件下进行创造性的劳动，把工作做得更多更好。
