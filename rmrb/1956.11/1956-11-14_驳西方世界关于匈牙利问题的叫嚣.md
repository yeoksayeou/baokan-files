Title: Refuting the Western World's Clamor on the Hungarian Question

The Western countries are making a great fuss about the so-called Hungarian question. The representatives of Western countries in the United Nations General Assembly, disregarding the unanimous opposition of the Hungarian government and other countries in the socialist camp, have repeatedly discussed Hungary's internal affairs and passed illegal resolutions interfering in Hungary's internal affairs. The Western "majority" in the United Nations, disregarding the fact that the presence of Soviet troops in Hungary is purely within the scope of the powers of the two countries, made a resolution demanding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary. Many countries have made various gestures of so-called sympathy for the Hungarian people and launched a violent anti-Soviet and anti-communist movement.

Who are they "sympathizing" with exactly?

As recently as the 9th of this month, a Reuters correspondent in Vienna was gloating and exaggerating the introduction of Budapest radio, saying: "The rebels looted a distillery in Pest-Hidegkút, shops were looted... At Budapest West Station, trucks were opened and things were robbed... Many buildings were set on fire... In several districts, the Communist Party headquarters were attacked by rebels, and in other districts, rebels came out of the cellars to surrender." Then, the Reuters reporter, apparently deliberately obliterating the fact that most of the rebels had surrendered, judged through the mouths of "observers in Vienna": "These messages may mean that the rebels are gaining ground again in Budapest."

The rebels did not "gain ground again in Budapest." This is just wishful thinking of the imperialist world. In any case, the Reuters reporter has made a sketch here of the behavior of the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries who were praised by the Western countries as "freedom fighters." Who are they? A group of murderers who rob, set fires, and commit violence against the people! May I ask the gentlemen of the United Nations, why shouldn't these murderers be resolutely suppressed?

These murderers are the people who killed, hanged, and burned Communist Party members and other sincere patriots in Budapest and other places in Hungary ten days ago, that is, the people commanded by Horthy's fascist officer Pál Maléter (Maléter led the armed rebellion from October 23 and was finally appointed "Minister of Defense" by Nagy), that is, the people relied on by the traitor Cardinal Mindszenty (Mindszenty called on the radio on the 3rd of this month to abolish socialism and restore capitalism and church privileges, and on the 4th went to the American embassy to "take refuge").

Western countries are trying their best to pretend to be friends of the Hungarian people, pretending to be protectors of Hungarian "freedom." When terrorists killed and set fires everywhere, attempting to restore fascist rule, Western countries tried their best to praise them; and when those murderers and arsonists were suppressed by socialist forces, they flew flags at half-mast to "express their condolences." This is the "friendship" of Western countries towards the Hungarian people! This is the "freedom" that Western countries hope for Hungary!

Let's take a look at who these protectors of "freedom" are?

In the emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the 4th of this month, the speech of the Spanish representative De Lequerica supporting the United States' proposal to interfere in Hungary can be taken to represent the faces of all these heroes. He said: "Now that Hungary is suffering, let us speak out from our hearts. We hope that the United Nations will intervene to liberate this country... I have seen thousands of people lose their lives in my own country, so I cry out loudly in enthusiastic support of the American proposal." It turns out that Spain, the only country in the world that openly practices fascism, the Franco regime that killed thousands of real freedom fighters, is crying out loudly for the "liberation" of Hungary! The American proposal and the American plan to "liberate" Hungary have been enthusiastically supported by the Franco regime, and it is not difficult for people to understand its essence.

The governments of Britain and France, despite being stained with the blood of Egyptians and Algerians, are also vanguards of protecting Hungarian "freedom" together with the United States. British Prime Minister Eden said on the 9th: In Hungary, the freedom and survival of a heroic nation has been wiped out by "the most brutal suppression." But Britain's aggression against Egypt was only "doing what the United Nations could not do at that time without police forces," that is... "maintaining peace" by bombing Egypt. French Prime Minister Mollet said it even more shamelessly on the 8th. According to him, the actions of Britain and France "have never been war actions against Egypt. Who dares to say that Cairo has been treated like Budapest?" "The Soviet intervention in the past few days must have made the free world better understand what France's actions in North Africa mean and what it means to leave."

Mollet said: The Hungarian events show which countries are truly concerned about freedom. We think this sentence is completely correct, but not according to Mollet's own meaning. It would of course be best if the Hungarian government could smoothly suppress the armed rebellion of the fascist elements supported by the West (even Western countries cannot deny that this is a rebellion). Now that the Hungarian government's own strength is not enough, and it is requesting assistance from Soviet troops, this does not make any difference to the essence of the matter. The Soviet Union is precisely concerned about and defending Hungary's freedom here. Everyone with a political conscience can easily understand by calming down: If Hungary does not request assistance from Soviet troops, and if Soviet troops do not come out to help, it can only become a fascist hell, and can only become an outpost for imperialism to further subvert the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe and create a new world war. What freedom can this give the Hungarian people? What good is this for world peace and human progress? The Soviet government just issued a declaration on October 30, reaffirming respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the people's democratic countries, preparing to re-study the issue of the stationing of Soviet troops in Hungary and other countries with the Warsaw Treaty countries, and had actually withdrawn from Budapest. If it were not absolutely necessary, forced by comradely feelings, forced by the duty of socialist countries to share weal and woe, forced by the fully exposed and imminent situation of the fascist restoration conspiracy, the Soviet army would certainly not be willing to take on difficulties and re-deploy. Isn't all this extremely obvious? The Soviet Union's assistance to the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government in suppressing the rebellion does not violate its October 30 declaration or the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Soviet army does not want an inch of Hungarian soil. After order is restored in Hungary, the Soviet Union and Hungary will still hold negotiations on the issue of stationing troops under the Warsaw Treaty. Even then, no United Nations police force will be introduced to carry out any international management of any territory or waters within Hungary. Therefore, if the Soviet Union's assistance to Hungary and the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt are compared side by side, it is either due to malice or misunderstanding. The fact is exactly the opposite. When the Anglo-French aggressors were killing and setting fires in Egypt and Algeria, it was also when Western countries were instigating fascist elements to kill and set fires in Hungary with weapons supplied by the West. When the Soviet government resolutely supported Egypt in resisting aggression, it was also when the Soviet government resolutely assisted Hungary in opposing the restoration of fascism. It can be seen from this that the Soviet Union's position on the Hungarian people and the Egyptian people is consistent, that is, to assist them in defending freedom and opposing imperialism. Similarly, the positions of many Western countries on the Hungarian people and the Egyptian people are also consistent, that is, to massacre them, attempt to enslave them, deprive them of their sovereignty, and interfere in their internal affairs. The freedom and survival of the Hungarian nation, like the freedom and survival of the Egyptian nation, have not been wiped out as Eden said; although Eden and other imperialist elements did dream of wiping them out, such dreams have failed on both fronts. Cairo has indeed not received "the same treatment as Budapest," because the Anglo-French air force bombed Cairo, while Soviet soldiers did not help the Egyptians put out fires there, as they did in Budapest. But the Soviet Union did intervene in the actions of Britain and France in Egypt, forcing Britain and France to accept a ceasefire. To paraphrase Mollet's words: The actions of Britain and France in North Africa in the past few days must have made the oppressed world better understand what the Soviet Union's intervention means and what its departure means for Hungary.

Hungarian Prime Minister Kádár said well in a broadcast on the 11th: "Whoever believes that the Soviet army should withdraw from our country first, whether he wants to or not, is in favor of counter-revolution, in favor of the shackles of imperialism, and in favor of abandoning national independence." The Western countries of the United Nations are demanding just that. The current "majority" in the United Nations will never support the socialist aspirations of the people of socialist countries; on the contrary, they are prepared to push Hungary and all people's democratic countries onto the road of Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Ngo Dinh Diem without hesitation. This is the essence of the several resolutions passed by the emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. The United Nations' resolution demanding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary proves precisely that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary will only benefit imperialism and will never benefit the Hungarian people.

We believe that the Soviet Union's actions in Hungary are completely just, not only because Soviet troops are stationed in Hungary only under the Warsaw Treaty and are helping to restore order only at the request of the Hungarian government, but also because this request of the Hungarian government is in line with the true wishes of the Hungarian people. Precisely because of this, the counter-revolutionary forces can be quickly crushed, and the social order of Hungary can be determined to gradually turn to stability throughout the country. Although the Hungarian people have expressed legitimate dissatisfaction with the work of the past government, they have never demanded to abandon socialism and accept fascism. The restoration activities of armed fascist elements are by no means a "spontaneous" mass action, but a group of conspirators imposed on the Hungarian people under the instigation of the United States and other Western countries, a point even pointed out by the Associated Press correspondent in Vienna: "Otherwise, how can one explain the appearance of green, white, and red flags with the Archbishop's cross in one day and night, or even within a few hours of the start of the rebellion? And how can one explain the tricolor armbands on the rebels' arms? Not to mention the weapons, 'seizing' cannot explain the source of the weapons, especially the trucks that transported the rebels to strategic strongholds and the motorcycles ridden by the messengers at the beginning of the street fighting cannot be explained."

Of course, the entire process of the Hungarian events is complex. There are various people who are dissatisfied with the work of the past government, and there are various people who participated in the rebellion, not all of them are fascist elements. Moreover, foreign troops assisting in suppressing the rebellion is always a very special situation, no matter how pure and kind the motives are, it is inevitable that some people will temporarily misunderstand it. The malicious distortions of many bourgeois newspapers make it even more difficult for ordinary people to understand the truth. Today, there are such ordinary people who echo the anti-Soviet and anti-communist clamor manufactured by imperialism. But lies will not live long. Clouds will not always stay in the sky. After order is completely restored in Hungary, people will see more clearly what the Hungarian people are asking for, and whether the Soviet Union has harmed or defended Hungary's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. It is not surprising that the reactionaries are stirring up an anti-Soviet and anti-communist trend. Everyone remembers that there was a worldwide anti-Soviet and anti-communist trend in 1939. Anti-Soviet and anti-communist elements made all kinds of slanders against the Soviet Union and the Communist Parties of various countries, which once caused a lot of confusion in the socialist ranks. But, as time went by, these slanders went bankrupt, and the prestige of the Soviet Union and the Communist Parties of various countries increased even more. Similarly, under the instigation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, there have been anti-Soviet and anti-communist trends in China time and time again; until February 1946, the reactionaries launched the last anti-Soviet parade and smashed the Chongqing-based Xinhua Daily, the organ of the Chinese Communist Party, and Democracy Daily, the organ of the China Democratic League. But all this instigation did not save the rule of the reactionaries. The people who were temporarily deceived finally recognized who was the enemy and who was the friend. The reactionaries of Western countries want to use the Hungarian issue to legalize their conspiracy activities to subvert the people's democratic countries, to undermine the prestige of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, to attack the international socialist movement, and to divert world public opinion's attention to the Egyptian issue. But their plans will not be fulfilled. The Hungarian counter-revolutionaries called out to Western imperialism on the radio: Help! Help! But imperialism was ultimately unable to save their lives, and in the end it could not save its own life. No matter how difficult and tortuous the road of socialism is (this is caused by complex historical conditions), it is still the only bright road for all mankind in the world.

The Hungarian events are also a major test for socialists in various countries. The Hungarian events are testing whether they are truly loyal to the principles of socialism and the principles of proletarian internationalism in the turbulent waves of struggle, and whether they can maintain a clear Marxist mind in difficult and complex environments without falling into wavering, frustration, and confusion. The Communist Parties of many countries in Western Europe have not been overwhelmed by temporary difficulties. They have resolutely explained the truth with a spirit of great internationalism, and have therefore been subjected to the crazy attacks of the reactionaries. The central organs of the French Communist Party were burned down by thugs, and the French Communist Party's L'Humanité and the progressive newspaper Libération were also attacked by thugs. This is not their failure, but precisely their glory. We pay them the lofty respect of communism.

### 驳西方世界关于匈牙利问题的叫嚣

    驳西方世界关于匈牙利问题的叫嚣
    西方各国正在所谓匈牙利问题上大吵大闹。联合国大会的西方国家代表不顾匈牙利政府和社会主义阵营其他各国的一致反对，几次讨论匈牙利的内政，并且通过了干涉匈牙利内政的非法决议。联合国中西方的“多数”不顾苏军驻在匈牙利纯粹是苏匈两国权力范围以内的问题，作出决议要求苏军撤出匈牙利。许多国家作出了各种各样的所谓同情匈牙利人民的姿态，并且发动了反苏反共的狂暴运动。
    究竟他们所“同情”的是谁？
    就在本月9日，路透社驻维也纳记者还在幸灾乐祸地和夸大其词地介绍布达佩斯的广播说：“叛乱分子抢劫了佩斯—海德卡特的一个酒坊，商店被抢劫了……在布达佩斯西车站，卡车被打开了，东西被抢光了。……许多建筑物被纵火焚烧。……在几个区内，共产党党部遭到了叛乱分子的袭击，而在其他各区，叛乱分子从地窖中出来投降。”然后，路透社记者显然故意抹煞大多数叛乱分子已经投降的事实，借“维也纳的观察家们”的嘴判断道：“这些消息可能意味着，叛乱分子又在布达佩斯得势。”
    叛乱分子并没有“又在布达佩斯得势”。这不过是帝国主义世界的单相思罢了。无论如何，路透社记者对于被西方国家捧成“自由战士”的匈牙利反革命分子的行状，在这里是作了一幅素描。他们是谁？是一群对人民抢劫、放火、行凶的凶手！请问联合国的老爷们，为什么不应该坚决镇压这些凶手呢？
    这些凶手也就是十天以前在布达佩斯和匈牙利其他地方打死、吊死、烧死共产党员和其他真诚爱国者的人，也就是霍尔蒂的法西斯军官帕耳·马勒特所指挥的人（马勒特从10月23日就领导武装叛乱，最后还被纳吉任命为“国防部长”），也就是犯叛国罪的红衣主教明曾蒂所依靠的人（明曾蒂在本月3日还在广播电台号召取消社会主义，恢复资本主义和教会特权，在4日就到美国公使馆“避难”）。
    西方国家竭力装做匈牙利人民的朋友，装做匈牙利“自由”的保护者。当恐怖分子到处杀人放火、企图恢复法西斯统治的时候，西方国家就竭力加以歌颂；而当那些杀人犯放火犯受到社会主义力量镇压的时候，它们就下半旗“志哀”。这就是西方国家对于匈牙利人民的“友谊”！这就是西方国家所希望于匈牙利的“自由”！
    我们再看看，究竟这些“自由”的保护者们是谁？
    在本月4日联合国大会紧急会议上，西班牙代表德莱克里卡支持美国的干涉匈牙利的提案的演说，或者可以拿来代表所有这些英雄好汉的面目。他说：“现在匈牙利既然在受苦难，我们就说出我们内心的话。我们希望联合国进行干涉以解放这个国家。……我在我自己的国家里曾看到成千上万的人丧失生命，因此我大声疾呼热烈支持美国提案。”原来今天世界上唯一公开奉行法西斯主义的国家西班牙，杀死了成千上万真正自由战士的佛朗哥政权，是在大声疾呼地要求匈牙利的“解放”！美国的提案和美国“解放”匈牙利的计划，得到了佛朗哥政权的热烈支持，人们就不难了解它的底细了。
    英国和法国的政府，尽管手上染满了埃及人和阿尔及利亚人的鲜血，也是跟美国在一起保护匈牙利“自由”的急先锋。英国首相艾登在9日说：在匈牙利，一个英勇的民族的自由和生存被“最残酷的镇压”消灭了。但是英国对于埃及的侵略，却只是“做了联合国在当时没有警察部队所不能做的事情”，这就是……用轰炸埃及来“维护和平”。法国总理摩勒在8日说得更不要脸了。据他说，英法的行动“从来都不曾是对埃及的战争行动。谁敢说开罗遭到了布达佩斯那样的对待呢？”“在过去几天中苏联的干预，一定使自由世界更好地了解到，法国在北非的行动意味着什么，以及它离开意味着什么。”
    摩勒说：匈牙利的事件表明什么国家是真正关心自由的。我们认为这句话说得完全正确，不过不是按摩勒自己的意思罢了。匈牙利政府如果能够自己顺利地镇压西方所支持的法西斯分子的武装叛乱（连西方国家也无法否认这是叛乱），那当然是再好不过。现在匈牙利政府自己力量不够，请求苏联军队援助，这对于事情的实质并没有两样。苏联在这里正是关心了而且捍卫了匈牙利的自由。每一个有政治良心的人把头脑冷静一下，就都不难了解：目前的匈牙利，如果不请求苏联军队出来援助，如果苏联军队不出来援助，就只能变为法西斯的地狱，就只能变为帝国主义进一步颠复东欧各人民民主国家和制造新的世界大战的前哨。这能给匈牙利人民什么自由？这对于世界和平和人类进步有什么好处？苏联政府在10月30日刚发出了宣言，重申尊重各人民民主国家的主权和领土完整，准备同华沙条约各国重新研究苏军驻在匈牙利等国的问题，并且实际上已经撤出布达佩斯。如果不是万不得已，迫于同志之情，迫于社会主义各国共患难之义，迫于法西斯复辟阴谋毕露、间不容发之势，苏军必然不肯甘蹈困难，重新出动。这一切不是异常明显吗？苏联协助匈牙利工农革命政府镇压叛乱，并不违背它的10月30日的宣言或者和平共处五项原则。苏联军队并不要匈牙利的一寸土。在匈牙利秩序平定以后，苏匈两国仍将就根据华沙条约驻军问题举行谈判。就在那时，也不会引进什么联合国警察部队，去对匈牙利境内的任何领土领水实行什么国际管理。因此，如果把苏联援助匈牙利和英法侵略埃及两件事相提并论，不是由于恶意，就是由于误会。事实恰恰相反。当英法侵略者在埃及和阿尔及利亚杀人放火的时候，也就是西方国家策动法西斯分子用西方所供给的武器在匈牙利杀人放火的时候。当苏联政府毅然决然地支持埃及反抗侵略的时候，也就是苏联政府毅然决然地援助匈牙利反对法西斯复辟的时候。由此可见，苏联对于匈牙利人民的立场和对于埃及人民的立场是一致的，这就是援助他们保卫自由，反对帝国主义。同样，许多西方国家对于匈牙利人民和埃及人民的立场也是一致的，这就是屠杀他们，企图奴役他们，剥夺他们的主权，干涉他们的内政。匈牙利民族的自由和生存，同埃及民族的自由和生存一样，并没有像艾登所说的那样被消灭；虽然艾登和其他帝国主义分子的确梦想加以消灭，但是这样的梦想在两个前线上都失败了。开罗诚然没有得到“布达佩斯那样的对待”，因为英法的空军轰炸了开罗，而苏联军人并没有在那里帮助埃及人救火，像他们在布达佩斯所做的那样。但是苏联究竟也干预了英法在埃及的行动，使英法不得不接受停火。把摩勒的话换一个说法吧：在过去几天中英法在北非的行动，一定使被压迫的世界更好地了解到，苏联的干预意味着什么，以及它离开对于匈牙利意味着什么。
    匈牙利总理卡达尔在11日的广播中说得好：“谁认为首先苏军应该撤出我国，不管他愿不愿意，他就是赞成反革命，赞成帝国主义的桎梏，赞成放弃民族独立。”联合国的西方国家正是这样要求的。联合国目前的“多数”决不会支持社会主义各国人民的社会主义愿望；相反，他们准备毫不踌躇地把匈牙利和一切人民民主国家推上蒋介石、李承晚、吴庭艳的道路。这就是联合国大会紧急会议所通过的几次决议的实质。联合国通过决议要求苏军撤出匈牙利，正是证明了苏军撤出匈牙利只有利于帝国主义，而决不会有利于匈牙利人民。
    我们认为苏联在匈牙利的行动完全是出于正义的，这不仅因为苏联军队只是根据华沙条约才驻在匈牙利，只是根据匈牙利政府的请求才帮助恢复秩序，而且因为匈牙利政府的这种请求符合于匈牙利人民的真实愿望。正因为这样，反革命势力才能迅速地被粉碎，匈牙利的社会秩序才能确定地在全国范围内逐步转向安定。匈牙利人民虽然对于过去政府的工作表现了正当的不满，却始终没有要求抛弃社会主义而接受法西斯主义。武装法西斯分子的复辟活动决不是什么“自发”的群众行动，而是一伙阴谋家在美国和其他西方国家的策动之下强加在匈牙利人民头上的，这一点甚至合众社驻维也纳的记者也指出来了：“不然，怎样解释一昼夜之间，甚至叛乱发动几个小时之内，就出现了飘扬着大主教十字架的绿白红旗帜呢？又怎样解释暴乱者臂上的三色臂章呢？更不用说武器了，‘夺取’是不能解释武器的来源的，特别是巷战开始时把暴乱者载运到战略据点去的卡车和传令兵乘坐着的摩托车更无法解释。”
    当然，匈牙利事件的整个过程是复杂的。不满过去政府工作的固然有各种人，就是参加叛乱的也有各种人，并不都是法西斯分子。而且外国军队协助镇压叛乱总是一种非常情况，无论动机怎样纯洁善良，总难免引起一部分人暂时的不了解。许多资产阶级报纸的恶毒的歪曲，更加使普通人难于认识真相。今天附和帝国主义所制造的反苏反共叫嚣的，就有这样一些普通人在内。但是谎话是活不长的。乌云不会老是停在天空。在匈牙利的秩序完全恢复以后，人们就会更明白地看到，匈牙利人民所要求的究竟是什么，苏联究竟是损害了还是捍卫了匈牙利的独立、主权和领土完整。反动派煽起反苏反共的潮流，这并不值得奇怪。大家记得，在1939年就曾有过世界范围的反苏反共潮流，反苏反共分子对苏联和各国共产党做了种种污蔑，在社会主义队伍中曾一度引起了许多混乱。但是，随着时间的推移，这些污蔑都破产了，苏联和各国共产党的威信都更加增长了。同样的，在国民党反动派的煽动之下，中国也曾有过一次又一次的反苏反共潮流；直到1946年2月，反动派还发动了最后一次反苏游行，并且捣毁了重庆的中国共产党机关报新华日报和中国民主同盟的机关报民主报。但是一切这种煽动并没有能够挽救反动派的统治。一时受了蒙蔽的人们终于还是认清了谁是敌，谁是友。西方各国的反动派想利用匈牙利的题目使他们颠复人民民主国家的阴谋活动合法化，想借此破坏苏联和各人民民主国家的威信，进攻国际社会主义运动，并且想借此转移世界舆论对于埃及问题的注意。但是他们的计策是不会如愿以偿的。匈牙利的反革命分子在电台上向西方帝国主义呼叫：救命啊！救命啊！但是帝国主义究竟没有能救他们的命，而且最后也无法救自己的命。社会主义的道路无论有怎样的艰难曲折（这是复杂的历史条件造成的），仍然是全世界人类的唯一光明道路。
    匈牙利事件对于各国社会主义者也是一个重大的考验。匈牙利事件考验着他们在斗争的惊涛骇浪中对于社会主义的原则和无产阶级国际主义的原则是否真正忠诚，在困难复杂的环境里面是否能保持马克思主义的清醒头脑，而不陷入动摇、沮丧和迷误。西欧很多国家的共产党没有被一时的困难所压倒，他们用大无畏的国际主义精神坚决地说明了真理，因而受了反动派的疯狂的攻击。法国共产党的中央机关被暴徒焚毁，法共的人道报和进步报纸解放报也被暴徒袭击。这不是他们的失败，而正是他们的光荣。我们向他们致共产主义的崇高的敬意。
