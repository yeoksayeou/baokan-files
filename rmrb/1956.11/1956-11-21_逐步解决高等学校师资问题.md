Gradually Solve the Problem of Faculty in Higher Education
By Our Staff Commentator

To cultivate a sufficient number of outstanding science and technology experts, to accomplish the arduous task of scientific research, and to improve and enhance the quality of higher education, the decisive key is to effectively solve the problem of faculty in higher education.

The basic situation of the current faculty in higher education is: small in number and poor in quality. With the exception of a few teachers who are academically specialized, the majority of teachers are limited by their academic level and lack teaching experience. The improvement of the faculty's level lags far behind the growing task of cadre training, the requirements for improving teaching quality, and the development of scientific research. If this situation continues, it will be difficult for higher education to implement the principle determined in the resolution on the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which states that "the number of students should be increased as much as possible while ensuring a certain quality," and it will be difficult to undertake the heavy task of scientific research. This will have serious consequences for China's socialist construction and the development of higher education.

In order to solve the problem of faculty in higher education, it is necessary to fully exploit the potential of the existing faculty, especially to vigorously cultivate new forces, and to gradually improve the teaching and scientific levels of existing teachers.

China's faculty in higher education has expanded rapidly, and the socialist consciousness of teachers has also greatly improved. As long as the potential of the existing faculty is fully utilized, the faculty shortage in higher education can be relatively reduced, and the existing teachers can concentrate more time and energy on further studies and improvement. In order to better utilize the potential of the existing faculty, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the Party's policy towards intellectuals, continue to help teachers continuously improve their socialist consciousness through political theory study, ideological transformation, and criticism of academic ideas; make reasonable adjustments to various school tasks and the use of human resources, and strive to ensure that teachers have five-sixths of their time each week to engage in teaching and scientific research; gradually improve the living conditions and housing conditions of teachers within the limits of national financial and material resources; and equip teachers with specialized expertise with necessary assistants and assist in solving problems such as equipment, books, and materials as much as possible. Necessary and rational adjustments should be made to the use of faculty resources between schools and between various teaching and research groups within the school. Achieving this is not something that can be done overnight and requires a series of measures and overall planning to gradually realize.

In order to ensure that the growth of faculty in higher education can adapt to the requirements of the rapid development of higher education, the state first needs to supplement a sufficient number of outstanding graduates from higher education as teaching assistants and graduate students each year in batches. To this end, various user departments are required, for the long-term interests of cadre training, to temporarily endure some pain in the next few years and appropriately reduce the number of graduates they require, leaving a necessary number and quality of excellent teachers for the schools. In addition to meeting the necessary number of teachers calculated based on the enrollment tasks in recent years, the State Economic Commission and other relevant departments should also prepare some reserve numbers for cultivating teaching leaders and backbone personnel for new schools as much as possible. If these required numbers are not fully allocated, some senior students can be assigned to undertake some teaching work that they can handle. It generally takes about three years of further study and improvement to train an ordinary teacher who can teach courses, and it is difficult to guarantee the quality of teaching with the current method of learning and teaching at the same time. It generally takes more than ten years to cultivate a high-level faculty member above the associate professor level who is of excellent quality and high level, capable of both teaching and scientific research. The task of higher education is not only to train university undergraduates, but also to be responsible for training senior teaching and scientific research personnel such as associate doctors and doctors in the future. If existing teachers are not given time to improve their studies, it will be impossible to train senior teaching and scientific research personnel. The kind of shortsighted approach that only cares about allocating teaching assistants to teach courses in the current year and ignores the long-term needs of teaching and scientific research is a shortsighted approach. In addition, higher education institutions can also organize scientific research personnel and engineering technicians from factories and mines to teach part-time, so that these part-time teachers have enough time to prepare lessons and participate in school teaching and research group activities, so as to ensure teaching quality and strengthen the connection between theory and practice.

Meeting the need for the number of teachers is only one aspect of the problem. Another aspect is to ensure and improve the quality of the faculty. Good teachers produce good students; only faculty of good quality can cultivate excellent science and technology experts. In order to improve the quality of the faculty, we must first help existing teachers in a planned way to gradually improve their academic level and professional skills through on-the-job spare-time learning, short-term off-the-job further studies, participation in relevant production internships, professional conferences, and academic research. This requires ensuring that they have time to study and the necessary books and materials, and that they study under the guidance of senior teachers with high academic levels in teaching and research groups. It should be understood that due to the increasingly heavy tasks of teaching and scientific research in higher education, it is difficult to transfer a large number of teachers for long-term off-the-job learning and further studies. Therefore, on-the-job spare-time learning has become the main way to improve the level of teachers. Secondly, we must vigorously develop the graduate departments of higher education. We should select outstanding university graduates with more than two or three years of practical work experience to become graduate students in a planned way, and make full use of Soviet experts and Chinese experts to guide graduate students' studies. According to advanced Soviet experience, the basic measure to improve the quality of faculty is to train faculty with the level of associate doctors through graduate departments. In some key universities, higher-level faculty can also be trained. At present, in addition to vigorously running domestic university graduate departments, China must also send outstanding university graduates or incumbent teachers to universities in the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries as graduate students in a planned way. There are still many majors and specializations in China that are scientific gaps. In order to fill these gaps in a relatively short period of time, the main method is to send graduate students and advanced teachers to study new majors abroad.

For the improvement of existing faculty and the training of graduate students, the leaders of each school, each department, and each teaching and research office can organize all teachers to formulate on-the-job further study plans based on the outline of the long-term plan to be determined for higher education in China in the future, and the tasks of the scientific research plan of the Scientific Research Planning Committee of the State Council, and continuously improve their Marxist-Leninist theory, scientific and technological level, and teaching professional ability through various effective methods. At the same time, training plans for domestic and foreign graduate students should also be formulated according to needs and possible conditions. According to the provisions of the degree and academic title system to be established by the state, actively engage in scientific writing, on-the-job further studies, and apply for leave to do degree theses and take associate doctoral and doctoral degrees when they have improved to a certain level. The school leadership should also, according to the state's degree and academic title regulations and the scientific achievements made by teachers in their on-the-job further studies, assist the scientific research departments and the degree committee and other relevant parties to evaluate teachers' degrees and review and upgrade academic titles based on teachers' achievements in teaching and scientific research.

Universities should actively and proactively cooperate with factories, mines, enterprises, and scientific research institutions to jointly train a large number of new teachers and improve the level of existing teachers. Under the premise of completing the teaching plan, school teachers should help factories, mines, enterprises, and scientific research institutions solve various theoretical and practical problems in national construction through scientific research, while factories, mines, enterprises, and scientific research institutions should proactively give schools more help in terms of manpower and material resources and reduce the difficulties for school teachers to further their studies and improve.

The relevant departments of local Party committees and school Party organizations must fully recognize that the cultivation and improvement of faculty is not only the decisive key to the future development of higher education, but also the basic condition for cultivating senior scientific researchers, and an important guarantee for completing the task of striving to bring the most urgently needed scientific departments close to the world's advanced level within the next twelve years. They must urge the relevant government departments to care about the political life of teachers, ensure that they have time to further their studies and improve, gradually improve their working conditions and living conditions, and encourage them to give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity in teaching and scientific research.

    逐步解决高等学校师资问题
    本报评论员
    要想培养数量足够的、优秀的科学技术专家，要想完成科学研究工作的艰巨任务，改进和提高高等教育的质量，决定性的关键就是要切实解决高等学校的师资问题。
    目前高等学校师资的基本情况是：数量少，质量也差，除少数的学有专长的教师外，大多数教师受到学术水平的限制，缺乏教学经验。师资水平的提高，还远远赶不上培养干部任务的增长、提高教学质量和开展科学研究的要求。这种情况再继续下去，高等学校就难于贯彻中国共产党第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议中所确定的“应当在保证一定质量的条件下，尽可能地继续增加学生的数量”的方针，就不易承担繁重的科学研究的任务，这对我国社会主义建设和高等教育的发展都将产生严重的后果。
    为了解决高等学校的师资问题，就需要充分发挥现有师资的潜在力量，尤其要大力培养新生力量，逐步提高现有教师的教学和科学水平。
    我国高等学校的教师队伍已经迅速地扩大了，教师的社会主义觉悟也大大提高了。只要把教师的潜在力量充分地发挥起来，就可以相对地减少高等学校的师资困难，并使现有教师能够集中更多的时间和精力来进修提高。为了更好地发挥现有师资的潜力，就要认真地贯彻党对知识分子的政策，继续帮助教师们通过政治理论学习、思想改造和学术思想批判，不断地提高社会主义觉悟；对学校各项工作和人力使用进行合理地调整，尽力保证教师每周能有六分之五的时间来从事教学和科学研究工作；在国家财力物力可能条件下，逐步地来改善教师们的生活条件和居住条件；对于学有专长的教师，应尽可能地配备必要的助手和协助解决仪器设备、图书资料等问题；学校和学校之间和校内各个教研组之间，对于师资人力的使用，要进行必要的合理调整。要做到这一点，并不是一蹴而成，必须采取一系列的办法，统筹安排，才能逐步地实现。
    为着使高等学校师资力量的成长能够适应高等教育迅速发展的要求，首先就需要国家逐年分批地补充数量足够的高等学校优秀的毕业生当助教和研究生。为此，要求各个用人的业务部门为着培养干部长远利益的打算，在最近几年内，要忍痛一时，适当地少要一些毕业生，为学校留下必要数量和质量优秀的师资。除了满足这几年根据招生任务计算的必须要有的师资外，国家经济委员会等有关部门还应该尽可能准备一些为新校培养教学领导骨干的后备数字。假如这些需要数字分配不足额的话，可以酌情提前部分高年级学生担任一部分可以担任的教学工作。要想培养一个普通能开课的师资，一般地也需要三年左右的时间来进修提高，现在那种现学现教的办法是很难保证教学质量的。要想培养一个质量优秀水平很高的既能从事教学又能进行科学研究的副教授以上的高级师资，一般地得花上十年以上的时间。高等学校的任务不仅仅要培养大学本科毕业生，今后还要负责培养副博士和博士等高级教学和科学研究人员，对现有教师不给时间让他们进修提高的话，那就无法培养高级教学和科学研究人员。那种只顾当年分配助教开课，不顾教学和科学研究长远需要的后备数字，是一种近视的做法。此外，高等学校还可以组织科学研究人员和厂矿工程技术人员来兼课，要使这些兼课的人能有足够的备课时间和参加学校教研组活动的机会，以便保证教学质量和加强理论与实际的联系。
    解决师资数量上的需要只是问题的一个方面，另一个方面就是要保证和提高师资的质量。好师出好徒，只有质量好的师资才能培养优秀的科学技术专家。为着提高师资质量，首先要有计划地帮助现有教师，通过在职业余学习、短期离职进修、参加有关本身业务的生产实习、专业会议、学术研究等方式，来逐步提高自己的学术水平和业务能力。这就要保证他们有学习的时间和必须的图书资料，并在教研组中学术水平较高的老教师指导下来进修。要知道，由于高等学校教学和科学研究工作任务日益繁重，很难抽调大批教师长期离职学习进修，因此，在职业余学习便成为提高教师水平的主要方式。其次要大力发展高等学校研究生部，应当有计划地选拔具有两三年以上实际工作经验的优秀的大学毕业生去当研究生，充分运用苏联专家和中国专家来指导研究生学习。根据苏联先进经验，提高师资质量的基本措施，就是通过研究生部来培养具有副博士水平的师资。在一些重点高等学校还可以培养更高一级的师资。现在我国除了大力办好国内高等学校研究生部以外，还要有计划地派遣优秀的大学毕业生或在职教师到苏联及东欧人民民主国家高等学校去当研究生。我国还有很多专业和专门化是科学上的缺门，为着能够在较短的时间内把这些缺门都补足起来，主要的办法就是派遣研究生和进修教师到国外去学习新的专业。
    对于现有师资的提高和研究生的培养，要求各个学校和各个系、各个教研室的领导上，可根据我国高等教育今后要确定的远景规划的轮廓，和国务院科学研究规划委员会关于我国科学研究规划的任务，组织全体教师拟订在职进修的计划，通过各种有效办法，来不断地提高马克思列宁主义理论、科学技术水平和教学业务能力。同时也要根据需要和可能的条件，来拟定国内外研究生的培养计划。根据国家将要建立的学位学衔制度的规定，积极从事科学著述，在职进修和提高到一定水平时，可以申请离职做学位论文，考副博士和博士学位。学校领导方面，也要根据国家学位学衔的规定和教师在职进修所取得的科学上的成就，协助科学研究部门和将要建立的学位委员会等有关方面，来评定教师的学位，并根据教师在教学工作和科学研究上的成就，来审定和晋级学衔。
    高等学校要积极地主动地和厂矿企业及科学研究机关通力合作，共同努力来培养大批新的师资和提高原有师资的水平，学校教师应该在完成教学计划的前提下，通过科学研究来帮助厂矿企业和协助科学研究机关共同解决国家建设中的各种理论问题与实际问题，而厂矿企业和科学研究机关要主动地在人力上和物力上给学校更多的帮助，减少学校教师进修提高的困难。
    地方党委有关部门和学校党组织，要充分认识到培养和提高师资不仅是今后高等教育发展的决定关键，而且是培养高级科学研究人员的基本条件，是完成争取最急需的科学部门在今后十二年内接近世界先进水平任务的重要保证，要督促政府有关部门关心教师的政治生活，保证他们有进修提高的时间，逐步地改善他们的工作条件和生活条件，鼓励他们在教学和科学研究工作上发挥积极性和创造性。
