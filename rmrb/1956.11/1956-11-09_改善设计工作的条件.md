    Improving the Conditions for Design Work
    Artificially Created Task Tension
    After graduating from school, I went to work at the Anshan Branch of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute. In these four years, batches of drawings for several large projects have been sent out from our hands, and one factory after another designed by us has been put into production. This is our design staff's small contribution to the motherland, and it is also the greatest comfort we have received.
    But at the same time, I also feel a kind of unspeakable depression. For several years, we have been working under extreme tension. Of course, our country is advancing towards socialism at an astonishing speed, and as one of the construction workers of the motherland, it is perfectly right to work hard. However, the facts are not entirely convincing. Many projects could have started design earlier, but the responsible departments were slow to make decisions or kept changing them, which delayed a lot of time. And after the task is issued, they demand that the design drawings must be submitted in a very short time. For a project, no matter how much it is delayed in the front, the construction time is fixed, and the construction material preparation time must not be less than one year to one and a half years. The remaining time, whether it is more or less, is all the design time. If you feel that the time is not enough, the higher authorities will ask us to combine the three stages of design into two stages, and the two stages of design into one stage. In short, we must submit the drawings on time. Unilaterally requiring the design department to "break the routine" to complete the task, why can't the higher authorities "break the routine" when deciding on the task and preparing materials for construction? Isn't this creating artificial tension? For the preliminary design of a large project, it is difficult to ensure that the design meets the principles of economic rationality and technical advancement without repeated comparison and research of the plan. The construction drawings of many projects cannot be submitted within the prescribed time at all, and we have to work overtime, disrupt the design process, disregard the staggered relationships between the various professions, and try to compress the time for considering problems and reviewing drawings. The quality of the drawings rushed out in this way can be imagined. In particular, the prescribed dates for many projects are not national construction requirements, but are subjectively determined by the staff of the ministry. For example, the experimental factory we are currently designing is a brand new job with no experience at all. Soviet experts also specifically told us to consider more, study more, and compare repeatedly. However, the ministry instructed that the preliminary design should be completed within four months. After the various professions within the design institute arranged it, the total time given to the main subject department was less than two months. Just carefully considering the overall plan of the entire factory took two weeks. If we are really so eager to build the factory, there is nothing to say. In fact, the state has not yet arranged this plan at all, and even the factory site has not been approved. There are also projects where the plan has not been determined and tasks are assigned for design. For example, a factory in the southwest that was built in the spring of this year submitted a preliminary design in just three months, but after it was submitted, there was no follow-up, and finally the project was cut from this year's plan. It is said that the plan has to be changed, either larger or smaller, and has to be reworked. As for the rush to get the drawings out due to difficulties in the supply of materials and equipment, or insufficient construction forces, they have been stored in the warehouse. This phenomenon occurs even more frequently.
    Due to the perennial rush to complete tasks, most of the comrades in the design department are not in good health, and they do not have time to study and rest well, or even to take a good look at their own drawings.
    "Shortcuts" Worth Considering
    In order to complete the task, the design department has taken some measures, or "shortcuts," some of which are worth considering. For example, the extensive use of reuse materials has played a certain positive role in completing the task; however, it has also produced deviations in blindly copying and not seeking improvement. Some new comrades who participated in the work took on the main design. Regardless of whether they understand it or not, they still cut and paste the drawings and hand them out. Errors generated in one project are not corrected in several subsequent projects, and there is no mention of adopting new technologies. The "parallel operation method" implemented among the various professions also has shortcomings. Before the drawings of the main subject department are made, the task must be given to the cooperating department first. This "parallel operation" disrupts the entire design process. The quality of the drawings designed in the chaos is of course difficult to guarantee.
    Unreasonable Unilateral Demands
    Let's talk about the relationship between the design unit and the construction unit! It is said that this relationship has always been very "tense." The lack of humility and acceptance of opinions by the design staff is one of the reasons. But in many places, the construction unit does create passivity for the design unit. Let's talk about the opinions on the design. They should be put forward in stages according to the design process. Once the preliminary design is approved, opinions on equipment capacity, layout, and production system should no longer be raised. However, often after we submit the construction drawings, the construction unit repeatedly asks us to change the equipment capacity or change the production system. Sometimes, we calculate some equipment capacities according to Soviet quotas, and the construction unit is very dissatisfied and accuses us of "not considering the Chinese situation at all." Of course, it is necessary to combine the design with the Chinese situation, but is it unreasonable to uniformly adopt Soviet quotas that basically conform to the Chinese situation for such major issues as equipment capacity when China does not currently have quotas? Sometimes certain personnel of the construction unit see something in a factory abroad, or find some materials in that new magazine, and regardless of whether they understand it or not, or whether this technology is mature or has any special uses, they insist that the design unit change it according to his opinion. If we agree to change it, the past time is wasted, and it cannot be modified in a short time, which disrupts the current design plan. If we do not agree to change it, then a lot of hats such as "not humble" and "arrogant" will be put on us.
    Some equipment data should be supplied by the construction unit according to the contract, but the construction unit often delays giving it, making it impossible to carry out the design work. By the time the data arrives, the design is mostly half done. At this time, they also put forward "deadline for submitting the design, otherwise the construction will be delayed, and the design unit will be fully responsible." Some equipment or special materials have been proposed by the design department long ago. Obviously, they can be purchased in advance, but the construction unit does not solve it, and drags on and on. When the drawings are sent to the site for construction, they request to change the materials or equipment. If you don't change it, the construction period will be delayed and the country will suffer losses. If you want to change it, you have to abandon all previous efforts, and sometimes even change the operating system because of changing one device.
    There are also uncoordinated relationships between the design unit and the construction unit. Due to the low quality of the design, the construction unit's plan is affected, and even serious waste is caused. This is something that design workers should strive to improve. However, in many cases, the construction unit pushes the problem of the construction plan to the designer, and sometimes even puts forward a lot of opinions, saying "the design is wrong," but in fact, it is not a problem after inspection. There are also some times when the drawings must be modified due to the opinions of the construction unit, expert suggestions, or other reasons. Originally, it does not affect the construction plan, or even if it does affect the construction plan, it can be solved as long as the construction unit properly arranges it, but the construction unit often insists on not changing it. These all add to the difficulty of design work.
    Difficult to Connect with Reality
    The leaders have repeatedly called on the design staff to go deep into the site, combine with reality, and improve and improve the design level. In recent years, we have paid attention to this issue and have been constantly striving in this direction. However, the objective conditions for connecting with reality are not so good. For example, from the day of handover and trial operation, the factory designed by us, the equipment and pipelines that are so familiar to us, have become inaccessible to us. This year, the Benxi factory designed by us started construction, and we specially sent several comrades to understand the problems in the start of construction, but they were blocked outside the factory gate. No matter what proof you have, you are not allowed to enter the factory during construction.
    The factory is usually not welcome to us either. To go to the factory to take a look, especially to see a more important workshop, I don't know how many procedures you have to go through. We are next to Angang, the largest enterprise in the country. It should be very convenient to go to the factory, but this is not the case. It is even more difficult to go to the factory to do some investigation and research work. The workshop only cares about completing its own tasks. It is impossible to convince them to help the design department do some experiments to improve technology, no matter how much you reason with them. I think Angang has such good conditions, and many of its workshops are first-class in the Soviet Union. It cannot be said that it is a good place to train design personnel. Why can't the leaders help us and the site to sign contracts to train design personnel and carry out research work in a planned way? This year, the ministry spent a lot of money to send people abroad to study, which is of course a good thing. But I think that with a small amount of money, Angang, this enterprise, can train a large number of design personnel and carry out a lot of research work, and the results may not be worse than studying abroad.
    These are my personal opinions, which may be very one-sided. However, if these problems cannot be solved well, it will greatly hinder the improvement of our design level.

### 改善设计工作的条件

    改善设计工作的条件
    人为的任务紧张
    我从学校毕业后就到黑色冶金设计院鞍山分院工作。在这四年里，几个大工程的图纸从我们手中一批批的送出去，我们设计的工厂一个接着一个投入生产。这是我们设计人员对祖国的微小的贡献，也是我们所得到的最大的安慰。
    但在这同时，我也感觉到一种难言的苦闷。几年来，我们一直是在极度紧张的状态下工作着。当然，我们的国家正在以惊人的速度走向社会主义，作为祖国建设者之一的设计工作人员，工作紧张是完全应该的。但是，事实并不完全令人心服。很多工程本来可以提前开始设计，但是主管部门下达任务时迟迟不决，或变来变去，耽误了很多时间。而等任务下来以后，又要求一定得在很短时间内交出设计图。一个工程，不管前面怎样拖，建厂时间是限死了的，中间施工备料时间绝不能少于一年到一年半，剩下来的时间，多也好，少也好，就是全部设计时间。如果觉得时间不够，上级会要我们把三段设计并成两段设计，两段设计并成一段设计，总之要按期交图。单方面的要求设计部门“打破常规”完成任务，为什么上级决定任务，中间的施工备料，就不能“打破常规”？这不是造成人为的紧张么？一个大工程的初步设计，如果不是经过反复比较研究方案，很难保证设计出来的东西都能符合经济上合理和技术上先进的原则。有很多工程的施工图在规定的时间内，根本无法交出，不得不加班加点，打乱设计程序，不顾各专业的交错关系，尽量压缩考虑问题和审核图纸时间。这样仓促赶出来的图纸，其质量好坏是可以想见的。尤其是很多工程的规定日期，并非是国家建设要求，而是由部里的工作人员主观决定的。如目前我们正在设计的某试验工厂，是全新的工作，一点经验也没有，苏联专家还特别告诉我们要多考虑、多研究和反复比较。然而，部里却指示要四个月内完成初步设计。设计院内部各专业一安排，给主体科的全部时间不足两个月，只是细致地考虑了一下全厂的总平面图就用了两个星期。如果真的这样急于建厂也没有话说，事实上国家还根本没有安排这项计划，甚至连厂址还没批准呢。也有的工程，方案根本没定就布置任务作设计，如今年春季作的西南某厂，短短三个月交出了初步设计，但交出来以后，一直没有下文，最后索兴从今年的计划里把这个项目削掉了。据说方案还要改，不是变大，就是变小，还得返工呢。至于因材料设备供应困难，或施工力量不足，把图纸急急忙忙赶出去了，却一直放在库里存着。这种现象更是经常发生。
    由于常年赶任务，设计部门的大部分工作同志身体都不很好，没有时间好好学习和休息，甚至于没有时间好好看看自己作的图纸。
    值得考虑的“窍门”
    为了完成任务，设计部门采取一些措施，或者叫“窍门”，其中有一些做法是值得考虑的。例如，大量利用复用资料，对完成任务起了一定的积极作用；但是也产生了盲目搬用，不求改进的偏差。有些新参加工作的同志担负了主要的设计，不管懂不懂，照样把图纸剪剪贴贴交出去。在一个工程上产生的错误，在以后几个工程上都不改，至于采用新的技术更谈不上。在各专业之间实行的“平行作业法”也有缺点。主体科图纸还没作出来，就先得给配合科提任务。这种“平行作业”，把整个设计程序都打乱了。在混乱中设计出来的图纸，质量当然是很难保证的。
    不合理的单方面要求
    再谈谈设计单位和建设单位的关系吧！这种关系据说一直是很“紧张”。这里设计人员不虚心不接受意见是原因之一。但在很多地方建设单位也的确给设计单位造成被动。就说对设计的意见吧，应当是按照设计程序按阶段地提出。初步设计一批准，在设备能力、布置、生产系统方面的意见就不应再提了。可是，往往在我们把施工图纸交出以后，建设单位还一再要求我们变更设备能力或改变生产系统。有些时候，有些设备能力我们是按照苏联的定额计算的，建设单位就很不满意地指责我们“一点也不考虑中国情况。”当然，设计要结合中国情况是必要的，但像设备能力这样重大的问题，在中国目前还没有定额的情况下，统一采用基本上符合中国情况的苏联定额难道不合理吗？有时建设单位的某些人员从国外某厂看到一些东西，或在那本新杂志上找到点材料，不管弄懂没有，也不管这项技术是否成熟，有什么特殊用途，就坚持要设计单位按照他的意见改。如果答应改吧，那过去的时间算白白用掉，而且也不是短时间所能修改好的，又打乱了当前的设计计划。如果不答应改吧，那么“不虚心，”“自高自大，”等一大堆帽子就被扣上来了。
    有些设备资料按合同应由建设单位供应，但建设单位往往迟迟不给，使设计工作没法进行。等到资料来的时候，多半是设计已做了一半了。这时候，又提出“限期交设计，否则延误施工，由设计单位负完全责任。”有些设备或特殊材料，设计部门早已提出了，明明是可以事先购置的，建设单位却不去解决，一拖再拖，等图纸发到现场要施工了，才来请求变更材料或设备。你不改吧，工期延误了国家受损失。你要改吧，就得前功尽弃，甚至有时因为改变一个设备，连操作系统都要变更。
    设计单位和施工单位的关系也有不协调的地方。由于设计质量不高，使施工单位计划受影响，甚至造成严重的浪费现象是有的。这对设计工作者来说，是应该力求改进的。但是，也有不少情况是施工单位的施工计划一有问题就往设计者身上推，有时甚至提出一大堆意见，说“设计错了”，实际一检查却不是什么问题。还有一些时候，因为建设单位的意见，专家建议或其他原因必须修改图纸，本来不影响施工计划的，或虽有影响只要施工单位妥为安排就可以解决的，而施工单位往往坚持不改。这些都增加了设计工作的困难。
    联系实际难
    领导上一再号召设计人员深入现场，结合实际，改进和提高设计水平。近年来我们已注意了这个问题，不断向这个方向努力。但是，联系实际的客观条件却不那么好。例如，从交工试车的那天起，由我们亲手设计出来的工厂，对我们那样熟悉的设备和管道，对我们就都成为不可接近的了。今年我们设计的本溪某厂开工，我们专门派了几个同志去了解开工中的问题，却被阻于工厂大门之外。无论你有什么证明，开工时一律不许进厂。
  　平时工厂对我们也是不欢迎的。要下厂去看一看，特别是看比较重要的车间，不知道要经过多少道手续。我们就在全国最大的企业——鞍钢的旁边，下厂应该是很方便的，但事实并不这样。如到工厂去做点调查研究工作就更加困难。车间里只管自己完成任务，要说帮助设计部门做些试验以改进提高技术，讲多少道理也讲不通。我觉得鞍钢有这样好的条件，其中很多车间在苏联都是第一流的，不能不说是培养设计人员的一个好地方，为什么领导上不能帮助我们和现场订立合同，有计划地培养设计人员，开展研究工作呢？今年部里拿出很多经费派人出国学习，这当然是好的。但我想用少许的钱，在鞍钢这个企业可以培养大批的设计人员，开展很多研究工作，其结果不一定比出国学习更差。
    这些都是我个人的看法，可能很片面。不过，这些问题如不能很好地解决，对我们设计水平的提高，是会有很大妨碍的。
