Xinhua News Agency, 10th - Over 12,000 tons of goods including soybeans, peanuts, and flaxseed have been loaded onto ships and will be transported to Hungary immediately. Another 44,000 tons of materials will also be loaded and shipped within the year. These materials are allocated according to the trade agreement between China and Hungary, and China will strive to transport these materials to Hungary ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th - A large quantity of cold-proof fur materials is about to be shipped from Tianjin to the People's Republic of Hungary.

This batch of fur materials includes more than 6,500 lambskin rugs and 30,000 sheepskins. In order to support the Hungarian people, the Tianjin branch of the China National Native Produce & Animal By-Products Import & Export Corporation has decided to ship these goods as early as possible, ahead of the schedule stipulated in the original trade contract.

A few days ago, the workers of a fur processing factory under the Tianjin Municipal Agricultural Products Purchasing Bureau were very excited after hearing that the Hungarian people had crushed the conspiracy of the counter-revolutionary elements. The workers selecting lambskins, whose original daily quota was 2,800 pieces, increased it to 3,000 pieces. Huang Rongfu, a technical worker and advanced producer, said: "Winter has come, and the cold felt by the Hungarian brothers who have suffered accidental injuries is also our cold. We must send warmth to them as soon as possible."

Along with these fur materials, 10,000 kilograms of camel hair and a large amount of cotton and other cold-proof materials will also be shipped to Hungary.

    我国争取提前把大批物资运往匈牙利
    新华社10日讯　一万二千多吨大豆、花生仁、亚麻子等货物已经装上轮船，马上就要运往匈牙利。还有四万四千多吨物资也要在年内装运。这些物资都是根据中匈两国贸易协定调拨的，中国将争取提前把这些物资运到匈牙利去。
    新华社天津10日电　大批防寒皮毛料，即将从天津运往匈牙利人民共和国。
    这批皮毛料中有六千五百多条羊羔褥和三万张羊皮。中国畜产出口公司天津分公司为了支援匈牙利人民，决定把这些商品尽可能地比原贸易合同规定的时间提前发运。
    前几天，天津市农产品采购局的一个皮毛整理厂的工人们听到匈牙利人民粉碎了反革命分子的阴谋以后，情绪非常振奋，挑选羔皮的工人原来每天定额是两千八百张，他们提高到三千张。技术工人、先进生产者黄荣甫说：“冬天已经来到了，遭受意外伤害的匈牙利弟兄的寒冷，也就是我们的寒冷，我们一定要把温暖赶快给他们送去。”
    将和这些皮毛料一起运去匈牙利的还有一万公斤的骆驼毛和大量的棉花等防寒物资。
