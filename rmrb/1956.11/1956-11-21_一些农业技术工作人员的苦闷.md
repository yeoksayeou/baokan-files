Some Agricultural Technicians' Distress

I am a staff member of the Duoba Agricultural Technology Extension Station in Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province. The agricultural technology extension station is an indispensable unit for completing the socialist transformation of the countryside, but many staff members here (including myself) cannot concentrate on the work of the extension station. There is a popular saying in the technology extension station: "A second-rate mind, a labor hero's legs, and a peddler's mouth."

	I. The quality of cadres in the technology extension station is not high: In some counties, cadres who have made mistakes or are considered difficult to deal with are sent to the agricultural technology extension station, and little attention is paid to political and ideological education at ordinary times. As a result, the extension station is generally considered a unit that good people do not come to, and even those comrades who were originally better begin to doubt whether they have made any mistakes before, and their thinking begins to fluctuate.

	II. The cadres of the extension station cannot concentrate on their own duties. In principle, engaging in central work is beneficial to the work of the extension station and can cooperate with it. But in fact, this is not entirely the case. Last year, during the "three fixings" of grain, all five cadres of our station went to the countryside to engage in the "three fixings," and the autumn plowing and winter irrigation work was not carried out. At the end of the year, we were supposed to summarize the work of the extension station for the whole year, but we had to go and do conscription work. The extension station has become a unit without summaries or plans, and the cadres of the extension station have become mobile cadres of the district office, drawn upon whenever needed.

	III. The cadres of the extension station are like peddlers, only able to bring back and sell a little of what they get from above, and their professional level cannot be improved. Usually, if you read thicker books, they say you are aiming too high; if you read books on mathematics, physics, and chemistry, they say you are not concentrating on your work and want to go to university. Some of our leading cadres are constantly shouting that "the professional level of cadres cannot keep up with the actual needs"; but in reality, there are no specific arrangements for cadres to study, and there is also a small trend around us that is hindering cadres from studying.

The cadres of the extension station run around in the countryside all day, the farthest place being thirty or forty li back and forth; we asked to buy a bicycle, but the county finance department did not approve our plan.

At first, I thought that the situation in our station was an isolated phenomenon. After I attended the provincial technology extension work conference this year, I realized that this is a fairly common problem throughout the province, and many technical cadres are as distressed as I am. Therefore, I feel it is necessary to raise this issue in the newspaper and ask the relevant departments to quickly strengthen the leadership of the technology extension station. 　Jiang Zixing

### 一些农业技术工作人员的苦闷

    一些农业技术工作人员的苦闷
    我是青海省湟中县哆吧农业技术推广站的一个工作人员。农业技术推广站是完成农村社会主义改造中不可缺少的一个单位，可是我们这里有很多工作人员（包括我自己在内）对推广站工作却不能安心。在技术推广站中流行着这样一句话：“二流子的脑袋，劳动英雄的腿，卖膏药的嘴。”
    一、技术推广站的干部质量不高：在有的县里将犯了错误或是大家认为没有办法对付的干部往农业技术推广站里送，平时的政治思想教育又很少有人过问。因而，推广站就被一般人认为是一个好人不来的单位，原来较好的同志，甚至也怀疑自己以前犯过啥错误没有，思想开始波动起来。
    二、推广站的干部不能专心做自己本分的工作。从道理上来说，搞中心工作对推广站的工作是有利的，可以配合。但事实上并不完全如此。去年粮食“三定”的时候，我们全站五个干部全都下乡搞“三定”了，秋耕和冬灌工作就没有搞。到年底，我们要总结推广站全年的工作，可是又要去搞兵役工作。推广站成了一个没有总结和计划的单位，推广站的干部也变成区公所的机动干部，啥时候要啥时候抽。
    三、推广站的干部同贩货郎一样，只能从上面贩一点回来就卖一点，业务水平提不高。平时看比较厚一些的书就说你是好高骛远，看数理化的书就说是不安心工作，想升大学。我们有些领导干部整天在喊“干部业务水平赶不上实际需要”；可是实际上对干部学习并没有具体的安排，在我们周围还有一小股歪风，在阻碍着干部学习。
    推广站的干部整天在乡下跑，最远的地方来回三、四十里；我们要求买一辆自行车，可是县财政科不批准我们的计划。
    起初，我以为像我们站里这样的情况是个别现象，今年我参加全省技术推广工作会议以后，才知道这在全省是一个相当普遍的问题，很多技术干部也和我一样地苦闷。因此，我觉得有必要在报纸上提出这个问题，请有关部门赶快加强对技术推广站的领导。　蒋紫星
