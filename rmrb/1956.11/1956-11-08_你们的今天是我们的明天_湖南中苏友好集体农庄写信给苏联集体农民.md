    "Your Today Is Our Tomorrow"
    --Hunan China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm Writes to Soviet Collective Farmers--
    The original Jiumu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changsha County, Hunan Province, solemnly held a naming ceremony on the 5th to rename itself the "China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm." On this day, all the male and female farm members, dressed in festive attire, gathered from all directions towards the open space in front of the farm, carrying red flags and beating drums, early in the morning. Representatives from the Hunan Province and Changsha County branches of the China-Soviet Friendship Association, as well as representatives from some organizations, members of agricultural production cooperatives in the surrounding two or three *li*, and local primary school students also came to offer their congratulations. More than 2,500 people attended the celebration.
    After speeches by the chairman of the collective farm and several guests, all the farm members unanimously passed a letter to the Soviet collective farm brothers and sisters. The letter stated that you have already achieved great victories and rich experience in agriculture, and the path you have taken is precisely the path we are currently taking. Your today is our tomorrow. Every member of our farm is eager to establish communication with you, and we hope that you will give us more information about advanced experiences in agricultural production technology and collective farm management, so that we can learn from you better and run our farm better.
    The "China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm" is located in the northeastern corner of Changsha City, Hunan Province, in a hilly area. It produces crops such as rice, tea, oil tea, and buckwheat, and yields three harvests a year. The entire farm has 461 households, with 2,370 *mu* of paddy fields and 365 *mu* of dry land. The naming of this farm as the "China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm" was passed at a general meeting of members of the original Jiumu Agricultural Production Cooperative. In recent days, the entire farm has been celebrating like a happy event, with every household posting large red couplets on their doors and colorful slogans on the walls. All 454 blackboard newspapers and wooden bulletin boards throughout the farm have also published this good news. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “你们的今天是我们的明天”
    ——湖南中苏友好集体农庄写信给苏联集体农民——
    湖南省长沙县原九木农业生产合作社，5日隆重举行改名为“中苏友好集体农庄”的命名大会。这一天，全体男女庄员们穿着节日服装，一清晨就打着红旗、敲起锣鼓从四面八方向农庄前坪会场集中。湖南省、长沙县的中苏友好协会和一些机关的代表以及周围二、三里外的农业生产合作社社员和当地小学学生也都赶来祝贺。参加庆祝大会的共有二千五百多人。
    在集体农庄主席和几位来宾讲完话后，全体庄员一致通过了给苏联集体农庄兄弟姊妹们的一封信。信中说，你们在农业上已经取得了伟大的胜利和丰富的经验，你们所走的道路正是我们目前要走的道路，你们的今天，正是我们的明天。我们每个庄员都迫切地希望和你们建立通信联系，希望你们多多给我们介绍农业生产技术上和集体农庄经营管理上的先进经验，以便我们更好地向你们学习，使我们的农庄办得好一些。
    “中苏友好集体农庄”在湖南省长沙市的东北角，是个丘陵地区，这里出产稻谷、茶叶、油茶、荞麦等作物，一年三熟。全庄共四百六十一户，有稻田二千三百七十亩和旱土三百六十五亩。这个农庄命名为“中苏友好集体农庄”，是在原九木农业生产合作社一次社员大会上通过的。这几天来，全庄像办喜事一样，家家户户都贴上大红门联，在墙壁上贴着彩色标语。全庄四百五十四块黑板报和木板报也都全部登载了这个喜讯。　（新华社）
