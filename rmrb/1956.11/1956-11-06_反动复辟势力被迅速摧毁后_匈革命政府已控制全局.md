Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 5th - Budapest Dispatch: After the reactionary restoration forces in Hungary were quickly destroyed, the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government has taken control of the overall situation in the country, and revolutionary order is being restored and established in Budapest and other places.

All the working people and true patriots in Hungary who cherish the people's regime are warmly responding to the call of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, actively participating in disarming the counter-revolutionary groups and sweeping away the nests of counter-revolutionary resistance. Faced with the powerful people's revolutionary forces, the fascist bandits entrenched in some public buildings hurriedly laid down their arms and surrendered on November 4th. The Nagy government, which cleared the way for counter-revolution and reactionary forces, no longer exists.

The proclamations and programs of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government have deeply attracted the working people and all upright patriotic people. In factories and even on the streets, people are enthusiastically discussing the calls and programs put forward in the Revolutionary Government's "Letter to the Hungarian People" and expressing their willingness to actively implement this program. Many workers who were deceived by counter-revolutionary propaganda have now had their eyes opened. They have clearly seen how the enemies of the people's system have tortured and strangled revolutionary workers, social activists, and outstanding representatives of the Hungarian people for more than ten days, and how they are trying to restore the rule of capitalists and landlords in Hungary.

In its "Letter to the Hungarian People" issued on November 4th, the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government pointed out that the new government is convinced that stable order and tranquility will soon be established throughout the country. It called on all working people and patriots to do their best to assist the government and its institutions in carrying out these tasks, and called on each of them to fulfill their direct obligations in their own production and work posts. This call has been widely responded to.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 5th - Budapest Dispatch: The Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government issued a letter to the Hungarian people in Budapest on the 4th. The letter to the people said: "The development of the situation in Hungary on November 4th has resulted in the complete failure of the reactionary forces. The Imre Nagy government, which cleared the way for the reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries, has collapsed and no longer exists.

Everyone has seen the painful scenes of the reactionaries carrying out atrocities and persecuting revolutionary workers, social activists, and peaceful residents.

The socialist forces of People's Hungary, together with the Soviet troops who came to assist at the request of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, have selflessly completed their tasks.

Revolutionary workers, communists, and social activists loyal to their people's regime and the great cause of socialism have emerged from underground.

The revolutionary government of People's Hungary calls on all workers, peasants, intellectuals, university students, all young people, and all patriots throughout the country to do their utmost to assist the government and government institutions, and everyone should stand on their own production section and complete their direct responsibilities in their own posts.

The Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government deeply believes that a stable order and tranquility throughout the country can be restored in the shortest possible time."

    反动复辟势力被迅速摧毁后
    匈革命政府已控制全局
    新华社布拉格5日电　布达佩斯消息：匈牙利的反动复辟势力被迅速摧毁以后，匈牙利工农革命政府已经控制了全国的局势，布达佩斯和各地的革命秩序正在恢复和建立起来。
    匈牙利一切珍惜人民政权的劳动人民和真正的爱国者，热烈响应工农革命政府的号召，积极参加解除反革命集团武装和扫荡反革命反抗巢穴的工作。在强大的人民革命力量面前，盘踞在一些公共建筑物中的法西斯匪徒，在11月4日这一天赶忙缴械、投降了。为反革命和反动势力扫清道路的纳吉政府不再存在了。
    工农革命政府的文告和纲领深深地吸引住劳动人民和全体正直的爱国人民。在各工厂里，甚至在街道上，人们都在热烈讨论革命政府“告匈牙利人民书”中提出的号召和纲领，并且表示要积极实现这一纲领。曾经上了反革命宣传的当的许多劳动者，现在眼睛都明亮了。他们已经看清楚：人民制度的敌人十多天来如何拷打、绞杀了革命的工人、社会活动家和匈牙利人民的优秀代表，并且在如何力图恢复资本家和地主在匈牙利的统治。
    工农革命政府在11月4日发布的“致匈牙利人民书”中指出，新政府深信，很快就要在全国确立稳定的秩序和安定。号召全体劳动人民和爱国者们尽力来协助政府和政府的机构进行这些工作，并且号召他们每个人在自己的生产和工作岗位上履行自己的直接义务。这个号召已经得到广泛的响应。
    新华社布拉格5日电　布达佩斯消息：匈牙利工农革命政府4日在布达佩斯发表了致匈牙利人民书。致人民书说：“11月4日匈牙利事态的发展使得反动势力完全失败。为反动派和反革命扫清道路的伊姆雷·纳吉政府瓦解了并且不再存在了。
    大家都看到了反动派实施暴行和迫害革命工人、社会活动家、和平居民的沉痛情景。
    人民匈牙利的社会主义力量同应匈牙利工农革命政府请求前来援助的苏联军队一道，奋不顾身地完成了他们的任务。
    忠于自己的人民制度和伟大的社会主义事业的革命工人、共产党员、社会活动家从地下出来了。
    人民匈牙利的革命政府号召全体工人、农民、知识分子、大学生、全体青年、全国一切爱国者尽量协助政府和政府机构，每个人应该站在自己的生产工段上、站在自己的岗位上完成自己的直接职责。
    匈牙利工农革命政府深深相信，全国稳定的秩序和安宁在最短期间就可以恢复。”
