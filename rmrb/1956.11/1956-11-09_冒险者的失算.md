    Adventurers' Miscalculation

    In the early stages of World War II, Hitler implemented a method of issuing war reports based on pre-conceived battle outcomes, with the aim of boosting the morale of the invading soldiers and flaunting his success in battle.

    This time, the British and French troops' invasion of Egypt also adopted Hitler's trick.

    On November 5th, British and French forces sent paratroopers to attack Port Said. On this day, apparently according to a pre-arranged plan, British Prime Minister Eden, the French Ministry of Defense, and the British-French Allied Forces headquarters in Cyprus simultaneously announced that the Egyptian garrison in Port Said had "surrendered." They even vividly described how "a ceasefire has been ordered" in Port Said, "Egyptian troops have laid down their arms," and "Egyptian police are currently performing their duties under the control of the Allied forces."

    However, these disciples of Hitler did not anticipate that they would not have the same temporary good fortune as their ancestor. They imagined that the Egyptian garrison had "surrendered," but the cruel reality was that the Egyptian garrison had annihilated all of the first batch of invading troops that landed. Although the invaders continued to transport paratroopers and send naval landings, the heroic Egyptian army, police, and residents were resolutely resisting the invaders with united hatred. This forced the head of the invading forces—British-French Allied Forces Commander Keightley—to change his tune and say that they had encountered "difficult and fierce fighting."

    The battle of Port Said proves that aggressors who rely on force and take risks always miscalculate. (Ping)

    冒险者的失算
    在第二次世界大战的初期，希特勒实行过一种按照事先设想的作战结果来发表战报的办法，借以鼓励侵略军士兵的士气，也炫耀它在作战中是多么得心应手。
    这次英法军队侵略埃及也搬用了希特勒这个手法。
    11月5日，英法派遣伞兵进攻塞得港。这一天，显然按照一个预定的计划，英国首相艾登、法国国防部和塞浦路斯的英法联军总部同时宣布：塞得港的埃及守军“已经投降”。他们甚至活龙活现地说什么在塞得港“已经下令停火”、“埃及军队已经放下武器”、“埃及警察目前在联军的控制下执行任务”。
    但是，这一伙希特勒的徒子徒孙们没有预料到，他们竟没有他们的祖师爷那种能够逞凶一时的运气。他们想像埃及守军“已经投降”，而无情的事实却是埃及守军把第一批着陆的侵略军队全部歼灭了。尽管侵略者继续运去伞兵，又派遣海军登陆，可是英勇的埃及陆军、警察和居民都在敌忾同仇地坚决抗击着侵略者。这使得侵略军头子——英法联军司令凯特莱也不能改过口来说，他们遭遇了“艰巨而猛烈的战斗”。
    塞得港的战斗证明：恃强冒险的侵略者总是失算的。（平）
