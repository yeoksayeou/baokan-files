　　Talking About Organizing Books

　　Just in Beijing, how many books are piled up there unorganized? Units with libraries, please check yourselves. Out of every ten thousand volumes, how many have been cataloged, shelved, and made available for use? Starting with the libraries of the Academy of Sciences and Peking University, let's display all the uncataloged and unshelved books that are gathering dust and work together to do a thorough job of organization. Having books but not organizing them, not making them available for use, not allowing them to play their due role, and not letting them serve scientific research is a hegemonic act of hoarding information and monopolizing academia. Perhaps this statement is a bit too strong. The main reason is still the limitations of various objective conditions, especially the problem of space. We can't entirely blame the people in charge for lacking sincerity or plans.

　　A university library from another province once suggested to the Peking University Library: "If your library is not organized within two years, then we will come and divide it up."

　　"No stimulation, no action." I believe that libraries with one million or hundreds of thousands of books yet to be organized should make every effort to proactively organize and catalog them, so that within two years, so many useful books that have been hidden from the light of day can be liberated from boxes and from bundles piled up in dark rooms, and given to readers who want to use them and urgently need them.

　　One way to urge accelerated organization is to temporarily stop buying new books if the existing new books have not been organized, temporarily stop buying old books if the existing old books have not been organized, and temporarily stop buying foreign books and periodicals if the existing foreign books and periodicals have not been organized. Only after the old ones are organized can new ones be bought. Otherwise, they will accumulate more and more, and when will they ever be cleared? Furthermore, if the old ones are not organized, especially old books, there is no way to buy them again, because it is not known whether these books already exist or not. This is like "refusing to eat for fear of choking," but it may not be a bad idea. New books and foreign books are urgently needed, so this method may not be applicable, but for old books, it can be used completely.

　　Regarding the method of organizing and cataloging, it should be "simple and without lofty theories." Don't talk high-mindedly about what kind of "classification method" should be used, as long as the book can be found. A shelf list is always better than no list at all. The books are shelved in the order in which they are organized, and the catalog is written accordingly. This work can be done even by people who have not studied any classification method. Then, write an "author index" and a "title index," which will make it even easier for readers to find books. "If there is surplus energy," then engage in the compilation of a "classification index." The reason why the current organization work is progressing so slowly is, in part, because the plan is to first classify and catalog, and then shelve according to the classification. This is the most foolish method. We should learn from the book shelving methods of large libraries in other countries. Small libraries should of course classify and catalog, but large libraries may as well first shelve according to broad categories, or even shelve without any classification at all, and then compile three indexes: "author," "title," and "classification."

　　For the classification and cataloging of ancient books, there is no need to "unify with foreign countries," that is Wang Yunwu's bad method. The "Records of the Grand Historian" and the "Book of Han" should of course be classified into the "History" category, but where should books like "Dream Pool Essays," "West Stream Collection of Talks," "Purple Peach Studio Miscellany," and "Sharing Sweet Words," which account for a large proportion of ancient books, be classified? My idea is that the classification of ancient books should not be too complicated. It is better to honestly follow the "Siku" cataloging method, first compile it, and provide it for those who need to use these books. There is no need to keep circling around the "classification method," trying to come up with ideas, but never producing a "catalog." (To be continued)

    谈整书
    就在北京，把书堆在那里没有整理的有多少。有图书馆的单位，自己去检查一下吧。每一万册里已经编目上架，可供使用的有多少册？从科学院图书馆、北京大学图书馆开始，把束之高阁的未编目上架的书籍，全部陈列出来，群策群力地做一番彻底的整理工作吧。有书而不加整理，不给人使用，不使其发挥应有的作用，不让它们为科学研究服务，那就是把持资料，垄断学术的霸道行为。也许，这句话说得分量太重了些，主要的原因，还是为了种种的客观条件所限制，特别是，房子问题，不能全怪主持的人们没有诚意，没有计划。
    有一个外省的大学的图书馆，曾经向北京大学图书馆提意见道：“两年之内，你们的图书馆如果还没有整理好，那末，我们就要来分了。”
    “不激不发”。我相信，有一百万册或数十万册书还没有整理的图书馆，应该尽量发挥主动的力量，做好整理编目的工作，使之在两年之内，把那末许多不见天日的有用的图书，从箱子里，从堆在黑房的一包包一捆捆里解放出来，给想使用、十分需要使用它们的读者们阅读。
    有一个督促加速整理的办法，凡新书没有整理好的，暂时停止买新书，古旧书没有整理好的，暂时停止买古旧书，外文书刊没有整理好的，暂时停止买外文书刊。等到把旧的整理好了，才能买新的。否则越积越多，何年何月才能清理完毕呢？再者旧的没有整理好，特别像古旧书之类，也没有法子再去购买，因为不知究竟已经有了没有这些书。这虽是“因噎废食”，但未尝不是一个好办法。新书、外文书待用迫切，也许不适用这个办法，但像古旧书，就完全可以用之了。
    关于整理编目的方法，应该是“卑之无甚高论”，不要高谈什么式的“分类法”，只要能找到书就行。一本排架目录，比没有目录总强得多。书按整理的先后上架，目录就照此写下去。这个工作就是没有学过任何分类法的人也都可以做。然后，再写“著者索引”和“书名索引”，那便更方便读者们的检书了。“行有余力”，然后才再从事于“分类索引”的编制。现在的整理工作，进行得十分缓慢之故，其原因之一，就是要先行分类编目，然后再分类上架。这是最笨的方法。应该学习别的国家的大图书馆的排书上架的办法。小型的图书馆当然应该分类编目，但大型的图书馆则不妨先行按大类上架，甚至全不分类即行上架，然后再编“著者”、“书目”、“分类”三个索引。
    古书的分类编目，大可不必“中外统一”，那是王云五的坏方法。“史记”、“汉书”固然应该归到“历史类”去，但像占古书里分量很大的“梦溪笔谈”、“西溪丛话”、“紫桃轩杂缀”、“分甘余话”等等，应该归到那一类去？我的想法，古书的分类，还是不要多生枝节，老老实实地照“四库”编目，先行编出，供给需要使用这些书的人应用为是。不必老在“分类法”上兜圈子，想主意，而总编不出“书目”来。　（续完）
