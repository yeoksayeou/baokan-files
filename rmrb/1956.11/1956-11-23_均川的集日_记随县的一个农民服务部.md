    The Market Day at Junchuan
    ——A Record of a Farmer Service Department in Sui County
    Huang Zhi
    Junchuan is a market town in Sui County, Hubei Province. I heard that the farmer service department here was doing a good job. October 27th happened to be the market day in Junchuan, so I traveled from Suixian County town to Junchuan that day.
    This is a small market town with only three or four hundred households; however, it is also a lively market town: almost all the shops lining the streets are stores, and male and female farmers are going in and out of the eleven outlets of the supply and marketing cooperative. The four sizable farmer canteens are mostly full.
    When I turned to the river side of the market town, I found that this area was even more lively than the market town itself: a large bamboo and woodenware market, a large mountain goods market, and two pig and cattle markets. The miscellaneous wood, small bamboo, pottery, and wooden buckets, carrying poles, hoe handles, baskets, earth baskets, wooden beds, wooden tables, etc. made by farmers, although crude, are very sturdy and are all traded in this area. Although it was time to close the market, trading was still going on.
    This is the farmer service department organized by the supply and marketing cooperative.
    Originally, farmers could freely buy and sell anywhere in the market town, as long as they were willing. However, most farmers naturally came to the farmer service department to trade.
    There is a reason why the farmer service department is so lively.
    In the eyes of the farmers, they will not suffer losses when doing business here, and the prices are fair. Here, buying and selling are concentrated, making it convenient for both parties to freely negotiate prices. If the buyer and seller each stick to their own opinions, and the transaction is difficult to complete, the traders of the farmer service department will come to help complete the transaction. The traders are familiar with the business and the market situation, and the prices they quote are generally more reasonable; sometimes they also organize the surrounding farmers watching the excitement to jointly negotiate prices, so that both the buyer and seller are satisfied. When the comrades of the supply and marketing cooperative talked about the role of the traders in this regard, they also believed that this was something that the personnel of the supply and marketing cooperative could not replace, because they were not as knowledgeable.
    Farmers come to the market from twenty, thirty, or even more remote places, and another wish is to be able to sell their products conveniently. If the seller comes, what should be done if there is no buyer? The farmer service department must of course solve this difficulty for the seller. I went to the pig market and saw that, apart from the traders and some people buying pigs, very few pig sellers were present. I inquired and found out that the farmers had handed the pigs over to the traders and had gone to drink tea or do other things. They didn't need to stay here, they just needed to find the traders to get the pig money when the market closed. If there are too many things on the market, it would be troublesome for the farmers to take them back if they can't sell them. Therefore, the supply and marketing cooperative came up with another good idea. They lent a sum of money to the farmer service department, so that the service department could buy all the goods that the farmers could not sell, could be sold later, and would not deteriorate in storage at the price, and sell them in their own outlets. On this day, I saw a lot of hoe handles, baskets, wooden chairs, and other things that had been purchased in the mountain goods store. Some farmers want to keep the products they brought to sell at the next market, so the service department keeps them safe for the farmers, categorizing them and writing their names on them. If the farmer's goods cannot be sold today, and they do not have change to spend, and they have to bring some oil and salt home, they do not have to worry, the service department can lend them a little money according to the value of the goods left by the farmers. During the busy farming season, when farmers do not have time to go to the market to sell things, the traders go to the countryside to buy the farmers' things.
    The farmer service department is not only limited to organizing farmer trade, but also actively guides farmers in sideline production. They are now in contact with nine agricultural cooperatives, and regularly understand the sideline production of these agricultural cooperatives, the types and quantities of production, and according to the needs of the market, publicize the specifications of the products to the agricultural cooperatives, explaining which products can be sold and which cannot. For example, not long ago, very little small bamboo was listed on the market for several consecutive market days. The traders sent a letter to the agricultural cooperatives producing small bamboo to let them get some goods. As a result, people could still buy small bamboo on the market as usual at the next market.
    Doing a good job in the service department not only greatly promoted farmer trade, but also properly arranged for traders (that is, the brokers of the past). The supply and marketing cooperative helped the service department to select its own manager, and according to the size of the value of the goods, stipulated different handling fees (from 1% [cattle, pigs] to 3% [bamboo and wood], some are 5%). More than a dozen traders determine the distribution of handling fees using the method of "dead division and active value" according to the principle of distribution according to work. I interviewed Yang Chunbin, a trader in the mountain goods industry, and learned that before the supply and marketing cooperative strengthened its leadership in farmer trade, in April, he only earned six yuan, and still needed to rely on government subsidies to solve the living problems of his family of four, but now the situation has completely improved. In August, he received 29 yuan in handling fees, and it will increase greatly in October.
    The farmer service department in Junchuan District has achieved such results only because the supply and marketing cooperative has strengthened its leadership in farmer trade and correctly arranged all aspects of its work.

    均川的集日
    ——记随县的一个农民服务部
    黄植
    均川是湖北随县一个集镇。听说这里农民服务部搞得比较好，10月27日刚好是均川的集日，这天，我便由随县城关赶去。
    这是一个小小的集镇，不过三、四百户人家；然而它又是一个热闹的集镇：街道两旁几乎都是商店，男女农民在供销社的十一个门市部进进出出，四个不小的农民食堂大都满座。
    当我转到集镇临河的一面，才发现这一带比集镇上更加热闹：竹木器市场一大片，山货市场一大片，另外还有两个猪、牛市场。农民出卖的杂木、小竹、陶器，以及制作尽管粗糙但非常结实的木桶、扁担、锄把、篮子、土筐、木床、木桌之类，都放在这一带交易。虽然这时该散市了，但交易还继续在进行。
    这就是供销社组织的农民服务部。
    本来集镇上任何地方，只要农民愿意，都可以自由买卖。但绝大部分农民自然而然地跑到农民服务部来交易。
    农民服务部这样热热闹闹，是有道理的。
    在农民看来，这里作买卖不会吃亏，价格公平。在这里，买卖集中，双方便于自由议价。如果买卖双方各执一词，成交发生困难的时候，农民服务部的交易员便走来帮助成交。交易员都是熟悉业务和行情的，他们说出的价格一般是比较合理的；有时他们也组织周围看热闹的农民共同议价，结果使买卖双方都心满意足。供销社的同志谈到交易员在这方面的作用的时候，也认为这是供销社的人员代替不了的，因为没有他们那样内行。
    农民从二十里、三十里甚至更远的地方来赶集，另一个愿望就是要求能把产品很方便的卖出去。卖方来了，没有买方怎应办呢？农民服务部当然要给卖方解决这个困难。我走到买猪的市上，看到除了交易员和一些买猪的人以外，卖猪的人很少在场。我探问了一下，才知道农民把猪交给交易员都去喝茶或干别的事去了，他们用不着呆在这里，只在散集的时候去找交易员拿猪钱就行。上市的东西多了，要是卖不了再挑回去农民也会感到麻烦。于是供销社又出了一个好主意，他们贷一笔钱给农民服务部，让服务部把农民卖不了的、以后可以卖出的、保存起来不会变质的货品都照价收买起来，在自己设的门市部内卖出。这一天，我在山货行就看见收买下来的锄把、篮子、木椅等东西不少。有些农民想把带来的产品留到下一集再卖，服务部便给农民保存好，分门别类，写上名字。农民的货物今天卖不出去，没有零钱花，又得捎点油盐回家，这也不用操心，服务部可以根据农民留下的货物的价值，适当借支给他们一点钱。在农忙的时候，农民没有时间上市卖东西，交易员便下乡去，收买农民的东西。
    农民服务部不仅仅限于组织农民贸易，而且主动地指导农民进行副业生产。他们现在已经同九个农业社有了联系，经常了解这些农业社的副业生产情况，生产的种类和数量，并且根据市场的需要情况，向农业社宣传产品的规格，说明哪些产品能销，哪些不能销。例如，不久以前，一连几个集日小竹上市很少，交易员便捎信给产小竹的农业社让他们弄点货，于是，人们下一集便照常可以在市上买到小竹了。
    搞好服务部，不仅大大促进了农民贸易，也适当安排了交易员（就是过去牙行经纪人）。供销社帮助服务部选出自己的经理，并根据货品价值的大小，规定了不同的手续费，（由1％〔牛、猪〕至3％〔竹木〕，个别的是5％）十多个交易员依据按劳取酬的原则，确定用死分活值的方法分配手续费。我访问山货业交易员杨纯彬，知道在供销社未加强对农民贸易的领导以前，4月份他仅收入六元钱，还需依靠政府的补助来解决四口之家的生活问题，但现在情况已经完全好转了。8月份他分得手续费二十九元，10月份还要大大增加。
    均川区的农民服务部只因为供销社加强了农民贸易的领导，正确地安排了各方面的工作，才得到这样的成绩。
