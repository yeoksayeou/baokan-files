Our government submitted a statement to the British and French governments on November 3rd, strongly protesting the barbaric act of aggression against Egypt by Britain and France, and seriously warning the British and French governments that if they are obstinate and refuse to pull back from the brink, they will face immeasurable and serious consequences. The protest and warning that our government has made to the British and French aggressors embodies the firm will of our six hundred million Chinese people. In the past few days, the people of our country have launched large-scale demonstrations and protest movements against the British and French aggression against Egypt, demonstrating the will and strength of the Chinese people. Anyone with a clear head should not ignore this serious warning.

The armed aggression against Egypt by British and French aggressors is not only a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter, but also a public challenge to the solemn resolutions of the Asian-African Conference. Therefore, Asian and African countries and their peoples cannot ignore the aggressive acts of Britain and France. China, as a participant in the Asian-African Conference, has a responsibility, in accordance with the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference, to take all possible measures to oppose colonial aggression and safeguard peace in the Asian-African region, in order to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people and strike at the arrogance of the aggressors. Since the British and French aggressors colluded with Israel to launch an attack on Egypt, the governments and peoples of Asian and African countries have severely protested the aggressive acts of the British and French governments and unanimously demanded that immediate measures be taken to stop the aggression against Egypt. The Indonesian Parliament has passed a resolution demanding that the United Nations declare Britain and France as aggressors and take sanctions. Asian and African countries urgently feel the need to work together and take action to support the Egyptian people and oppose the aggressors.

Currently, the United Nations General Assembly is discussing the issue of Egypt being invaded by Britain, France, and Israel. On November 1st, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution with an overwhelming majority of sixty-four votes, demanding that the belligerents immediately cease fire and withdraw all troops to behind the original Israel-Egypt armistice line. The passage of this resolution reflects the demands of the people of the world and also reflects the extreme political and moral isolation of the aggressors.

However, the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly does not mean that the flames of war have been extinguished and the aggression has been stopped. The United Nations must now take rapid and effective steps to force Israeli troops to withdraw from Egyptian territory immediately, and order Britain and France to immediately cease military action against Egypt. Since the British and French forces' attack on the Suez Canal area has already begun, the United Nations' actions must be faster than the actions of the British and French aggressors. As Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out: "The important thing is: how to make the United Nations process proceed faster, faster than the process of war." The aggressors must not be allowed to occupy the Suez Canal area, and then use the fait accompli to coerce in order to achieve their goal of occupying Egyptian territory. The Suez Canal issue can only be resolved peacefully on the basis of stopping the aggression and fully restoring Egypt's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Any disguised interference is not allowed.

At present, the major task facing all peace-loving people in the world, especially the people of Asian and African countries, is to further unite and take various effective measures to force Britain, France, and Israel to immediately stop the aggression and retreat to the places where they started the aggression. To this end, the Chinese people are determined to wage a resolute struggle together with the Egyptian people, the people of Asian and African countries, and the people of the world, and will never give up until the goal is achieved.

### 中国对英法的抗议和警告

    中国对英法的抗议和警告
    我国政府在11月3日向英国和法国政府提交了一项声明，强烈地抗议英、法侵略埃及的野蛮行为，并严重警告英国和法国政府，如果它们执迷不悟，拒绝悬崖勒马，那末，它们就要面对无可估量的严重后果。我国政府对英国、法国侵略者所提出的抗议和警告，体现了我们六亿中国人民的坚决意志。最近这几天里，我国各地人民掀起了大规模的反对英、法侵略埃及的游行示威和抗议运动，显示了中国人民的意志和力量。凡是神志清醒的人，都不应当忽视这个严重警告。
    英、法侵略者对埃及进行的武装侵略，不但是粗暴地破坏了联合国宪章，而且是对亚非会议庄严决议的公然挑战。因此，亚非国家及其人民对于英、法的侵略行为，决不能置之不理。中国是亚非会议的参与国，有责任按照亚非会议的决议，为反对殖民侵略，维护亚非地区的和平而采取一切可能的措施，以支持埃及人民的正义斗争，打击侵略者的凶焰。自从英、法侵略者同以色列勾结在一起向埃及发动进攻以来，亚非国家的政府和人民都严厉地抗议英、法政府的侵略行为，一致要求立即采取措施制止对埃及的侵略。印度尼西亚国会已经通过决议，要求联合国宣布英、法为侵略者，并且采取制裁行动。亚非国家都迫切地感到必须共同努力，采取行动，支持埃及人民，反对侵略者。
    现在，联合国大会正在讨论埃及遭到英、法、以色列侵略的问题。11月1日联合国大会以六十四票的压倒多数通过了决议，要求敌对双方立即停火，并把一切部队撤到原来的以色列—埃及停战线的后面。这个决议的通过反映了全世界人民的要求，也反映了侵略者在政治上和道义上的极端孤立。
    但是，联合国大会的决议并不等于战火被扑灭和侵略被制止。联合国现在必须迅速采取有效的步骤，强制以色列军队立即撤出埃及领土，勒令英国和法国立即停止对埃及的军事行动。由于英、法军队对苏伊士运河区的进攻已经开始，因此，联合国的行动必须快过于英法侵略者的行动。正如印度尼赫鲁总理所指出的：“要紧的事情是：怎样使联合国的进程进行得快一些，比战争的进程快一些。”决不能容许侵略者侵占苏伊士运河区，然后凭借既成事实进行要挟，以达到它们侵占埃及领土的目的。苏伊士运河问题只能在停止侵略、并且完全恢复埃及主权和领土完整的基础上，才能得到和平解决。任何变相的干涉都是不能容许的。
    目前放在全世界爱好和平人民特别是亚非各国人民面前的重大任务，就是要进一步团结起来，采取各种有效措施，迫使英、法和以色列立即停止侵略，退回到它们开始发动侵略的地方去。为此中国人民决心同埃及人民、亚非各国人民和全世界人民一起进行坚决斗争，不达目的决不罢休。
