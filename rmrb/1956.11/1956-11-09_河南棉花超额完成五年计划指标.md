Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 7th: Henan Province's total cotton production this year is estimated to reach 435 million catties, an increase of 28% compared to last year; it also exceeds the target for the final year of the First Five-Year Plan by more than 62.7 million catties.

According to the Henan Provincial agricultural department, cotton production in low-yield areas throughout the province has greatly increased this year. Among them, eleven counties have increased their output by more than 50% compared to last year, and seven counties have increased by more than 100%. Nanyang Prefecture, which has consistently had low cotton yields, had more than 180,000 mu of cotton fields with an average yield of 50 catties of ginned cotton per mu, and more than 20,000 mu with an average yield of about 100 catties of ginned cotton per mu.

This year, due to disasters in Henan Province, 900,000 mu of cotton fields were abandoned throughout the province. However, thanks to the bumper harvest in other areas of the province, this loss was compensated for, and the plan was exceeded.

    河南棉花超额完成五年计划指标
    新华社郑州7日电　河南省今年棉花总产量预计达到四亿三千五百多万斤，比去年增产28％；也超额六千二百七十多万斤完成第一个五年计划最后一年的指标。
    据河南省农业部门的了解，今年全省棉花低产地区的产量有了很大的提高，其中有十一个县的产量较去年增加了五成以上，七个县增加了一倍以上。棉花产量一向很低的南阳专区，今年有十八万多亩棉田每亩平均产量达皮棉五十斤，二万多亩每亩平均产皮棉一百斤左右。
    今年，河南省因灾害侵袭，全省有九十万亩棉田被废弃。但是，由于全省其他地区丰收，补偿了这个损失并超额完成了计划。
