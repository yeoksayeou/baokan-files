    Should Discipline One's Own Children
    To the Editor:
        Some time ago, I had the opportunity to live next door to Zhu Kaiquan, the President of the Jiangxi Provincial Higher People's Court, and his family for a few days. President Zhu has two sons, one about ten years old and the other about seven or eight. They were fighting all day long, disturbing the neighbors, but no one dared to say a word to them. President Zhu had a correspondent, a young man in his twenties who was quite honest. The two children usually beat and scolded him. One day, they were scolding the correspondent again and even picked up a large stone to hit him. President Zhu not only did not educate his children, but instead believed his children's words and blamed the correspondent for hitting the children (in fact, he did not hit them at all). As a result, as soon as President Zhu left, the two children immediately chased after the correspondent to beat him. The older child picked up a stone the size of a bowl and hit the correspondent, injuring his right chest. President Zhu's wife came out of the room after seeing this, and she neither asked about the correspondent's injuries, nor did she blame the children for their barbaric behavior, but just stared at the children and the correspondent and smiled.
        The children of the janitor in the yard were also often chased and beaten by President Zhu's two sons. Once, these two children were about to hit the janitor's children again, and the janitor's old mother said not to fight. Then they used stones and bruised the old woman's leg. Another time, the two children broke many of the flowers planted by the janitor by the roadside. I said something to them, and they picked up the flower branches in their hands and chased me to hit me. I had to dodge, and they cursed vulgarities behind me.
        However, what is puzzling is that although these two children have become "little tyrants," and their words and deeds are so hateful, their father—President Zhu of the Provincial Higher People's Court—is oblivious to it. Not only does he not educate his children, but also defends his children's behavior when others offer opinions to him. He often says to people: The child is sick, you can't say anything to him, you have to indulge him and make him happy. Obviously, this is not loving the child, but harming the child. I hope that President Zhu and his wife can change their attitude of indulgence and leniency towards their children and truly take responsibility for educating their children.
                                                                                                Li Guohua
    Editor's Note: According to our investigation, President Zhu Kaiquan's younger son does suffer from epilepsy; however, even so, President Zhu Kaiquan's attitude of letting his children beat and scold people is wrong. Comrade Zhu Kaiquan is the President of the People's Court, and he and his wife are both Communist Party members, and should exemplarily abide by the laws of the state and communist morality, and earnestly take responsibility for disciplining their children; and in the case of a child with an illness, some effective measures should be taken to prevent them from hitting and scolding people, which is the attitude that parents should take.

### 应当管教自己的孩子

    应当管教自己的孩子编辑同志：
    前一个时期，我有机会和江西省高级人民法院院长朱开铨一家作了几天邻居。朱院长家有两个男孩子，大的有十来岁，小的约七、八岁，他们成天打架，弄得四邻不安，却没有人敢说他们一句。朱院长有个通讯员，二十多岁的小伙子，人挺老实，两个孩子平常对他不是打就是骂。有一天，他们又骂通讯员，而且拿起一块大石头要打他。朱院长不但不教育自己的孩子，反而轻信孩子的话，责备通讯员不该打孩子（其实根本没有打）。因此，等朱院长走后，两个孩子马上追着要打通讯员，大孩子捡起一块碗口大的石头就朝通讯员打去，打伤了他的右胸。朱院长的妻子从房里出来看到这一情况后，既没有问一问通讯员的伤势如何，更没有责备孩子的这种野蛮行为，只是瞅着孩子和通讯员笑。
    院里看房工友的几个孩子也经常被朱院长的两个儿子追打。有一次，这两个孩子又要打工友的孩子，工友的老太太说了一句不要打架，他们就用石头打青肿了老太太的腿。又一次，两个孩子把工友种在路边的花折了许多，我在旁边说了一句，他们就拿起手上的花枝追着我又要打，我只好躲开，他们就在后面骂下流话。
    但是，令人不解的是，尽管这两个孩子已经成了“小霸王”，他们的言语行为是多么地令人愤恨，可是他们的爸爸——省高级人民法院的朱院长，却熟视无睹，不但不对孩子进行教育，而且当别人向他提出意见时，还为孩子的这种行为辩护。他常对人说：孩子有病，说不得，要顺着他，让他高兴。很明显，这种做法不是在爱护孩子，而是在害孩子。我希望朱院长夫妇能够改变放纵和姑息孩子的态度，切实地负起教育子女的责任。　李国华
    编者附注：根据我们调查，朱开铨同志的小的一个男孩子确实患有羊癫痫症；但是即使如此，朱开铨同志对自己孩子打骂人的行为采取放任不管的态度是不对的。朱开铨同志是人民法院院长，他和他的爱人又都是共产党员，应该模范地遵守国家的法律和共产主义道德，切实地负起管教孩子的责任；而在孩子有病的情况下，则应该采取一些有效的措施，防止他们打人和骂人，才是作父母的应该采取的态度。
