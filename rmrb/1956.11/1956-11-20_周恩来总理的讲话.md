Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Dear Premier Pham Van Dong,
Dear Chairman Tran Duy Hung of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee,
Dear friends and comrades,

Please allow me to first express my heartfelt gratitude to you for giving us such a friendly, warm, and grand welcome. On behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, I extend fraternal greetings to the people of Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Hanoi is a city with a rich revolutionary tradition. In this city, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was officially proclaimed in September 1945. As the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi symbolizes Vietnam's independence. The perfidious attacks of the colonialists once caused Hanoi to fall again, but thanks to the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, Hanoi has returned to the hands of the Vietnamese people. Hanoi symbolizes the victory of the Vietnamese people.

The brilliant victories achieved under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Hồ Chí Minh have inspired all oppressed nations around the world. After eight years of persistent resistance, the Vietnamese people finally dealt a decisive blow to the colonialists in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, proving that any oppressed nation, as long as they unite and persist in their struggle, can defeat the colonialists.

The victory of the Vietnamese people forced the colonialists to sign the Geneva Accords, which enabled the re-liberation of Hanoi, consolidated the North of Vietnam, and restored peace in Indochina. The Geneva Accords stipulated that Vietnam should achieve peaceful reunification through national elections. Due to obstruction and sabotage by the United States, this provision has not been implemented to this day. However, the whole of Vietnam is a single country, and the Vietnamese people, regardless of North or South, demand reunification. The Chinese government and people firmly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese government and people to uphold the Geneva Accords and achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

The people of China and Vietnam, who have sympathized with and supported each other in times of adversity, have established a deep fraternal friendship. Since our two countries overthrew colonial rule and established people's democratic systems, the friendly relations between our two countries have gained full conditions for development. In January 1950, shortly after the birth of the People's Republic of China, our two countries quickly established diplomatic relations. For more than six years, the relations between the people and governments of our two countries have become increasingly close, and economic, cultural exchanges and other forms of contact have become increasingly frequent. Premier Pham Van Dong's visit to China in 1954 and President Ho Chi Minh's visit in 1955 played a significant role in enhancing the friendship and cooperation between our two countries.

Our friendship and cooperation are based on the Five Principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. At the same time, our two countries are united by the common ideal of socialism and the spirit of internationalism. Therefore, our friendship is eternal and unbreakable.

The Chinese and Vietnamese people both love peace. The Chinese and Vietnamese people are firmly opposed to colonialism. At the Geneva Conference and the Bandung Conference, our two countries worked together to defend peace, safeguard national independence, and promote international cooperation. Since the Bandung Conference, the movement against colonialism and for national independence has been further developed in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In the ranks of defending peace and opposing war, there are not only socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, but also many Asian and African countries determined to strive for and safeguard their national independence, and other countries that tend to peace and neutrality and oppose joining aggressive blocs, as well as peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world. There is no doubt that the forces of peace have been greatly strengthened, and the forces of imperialist war are becoming increasingly weakened.

It should be pointed out that the imperialists are not reconciled to their defeat. Recently, Britain, France, and Israel flagrantly invaded Egypt. Not only have they not withdrawn their troops from Egypt, but they are also increasing their armed forces and military equipment. The United States is also attempting to use the name of the United Nations to intervene in and control the Suez Canal, and to impose the so-called "Dulles Plan," which infringes on Egypt's sovereignty, on the Egyptian people. These imperialists even vainly attempt to subvert socialist countries and shamelessly slander socialist countries in an attempt to divert the world's attention from their aggression against Egypt.

However, the imperialists will never achieve their goals. The imperialists' aggression against Egypt has been met with heroic resistance from the Egyptian people and the people of Arab countries, and resolute opposition from the people of Asia and Africa and all peace-loving countries and people around the world. The imperialists' attempt to subvert socialist countries has also failed. Under the aggression and offensive of imperialism, the awareness of the people of Asia, Africa, and the world has been raised, and they have become more aware of the need to strengthen the unity of all peace-loving forces in the world. The Chinese and Vietnamese people, who have long experience in struggle, have a deeper understanding that unity is strength. We believe that the friendly and united people of China and Vietnam will certainly make greater contributions to peace in Asia and the world.

Long live the Democratic Republic of Vietnam!
Long live the friendship between the people of China and Vietnam!
Long live the unbreakable unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live the unity of the people of Asia and Africa, the people of the world!
Long live peace in Asia and the world!

### 周恩来总理的讲话

专栏：

    周恩来总理的讲话亲爱的总理范文同同志：亲爱的河内市行政委员会主席陈维兴同志：亲爱的朋友们，同志们：
    请允许我首先向你们表示衷心的感谢，感谢你们给我们这样友好、热烈、盛大的欢迎。我代表中华人民共和国政府和人民，向你们越南民主共和国首都河内的人民，致兄弟般的敬礼。
    河内是一个富有革命传统的城市。在这个城市里，越南民主共和国在1945年9月正式宣告成立。作为越南民主共和国的首都，河内象征着越南的独立。殖民主义者背信弃义的进攻曾经使河内再次沦陷，但是，由于越南人民的英勇斗争，河内又重新回到越南人民的手中。河内象征着越南人民的胜利。
    越南人民在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的领导下所取得的辉煌胜利，鼓舞了全世界被压迫的民族。越南人民经过了八年的持久抗战终于在奠边府战役中给予殖民主义者以决定性的打击，这就证明了，任何被压迫的民族只要团结一致、坚持斗争，他们就能够打败殖民主义者。
    越南人民的胜利迫使殖民主义者签订日内瓦协议，使河内重新解放，使越南北部获得了巩固的机会，使印度支那和平获得了恢复。日内瓦协议规定，越南应该通过全国选举实现和平统一。由于美国的阻挠和破坏，这一规定至今没有能够实施。但是，整个越南是一个单一的国家，越南人民不分南北都要求统一。中国政府和人民坚决支持越南政府和人民维护日内瓦协定和实现祖国和平统一的正义斗争。
    在患难中相互同情和相互支持的中越两国人民已经建立了兄弟般的深厚友谊。自从我们两国推翻了殖民主义的统治，建立了人民民主制度以来，我们两国的友好关系更获得了充分发展的条件。1950年1月，中华人民共和国诞生后不久，我们两国就迅速地建立了邦交。六年多以来，我们两国人民之间和两国政府之间的关系日益密切，经济、文化交流和其他各种形式的接触往来日益频繁。1954年范文同总理和1955年胡志明主席到中国的访问，对于增进我们两国之间的友谊和合作更起了重大的作用。
    我们的友谊和合作是建立在互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则的基础上的。同时，我们两国又是以社会主义的共同理想和国际主义的精神团结在一起的。因此，我们的友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的。
      中国人民和越南人民都热爱和平。中国人民和越南人民都坚决反对殖民主义。在日内瓦会议和万隆会议中，我们两国曾经为保卫和平、维护民族独立和促进国际合作而共同努力。万隆会议以后，反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的运动在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲又有了进一步的开展。在保卫和平、反对战争的队伍中，不仅有着以苏联为首的社会主义国家，而且还有许多决心争取和维护自己的民族独立的亚非国家，和趋向和平中立、反对参加侵略集团的其他国家，还有全世界爱好和平和主持正义的人民。毫无疑问，和平力量是大大地加强了，帝国主义战争势力是越来越削弱了。
    应该指出，帝国主义者是不会甘心于他们的失败的。最近，英国、法国和以色列公然侵略埃及。他们不仅没有从埃及撤兵，而且还在增派武装力量和军事装备。美国还企图假借联合国的名义，插手控制苏伊士运河，把侵犯埃及主权的所谓“杜勒斯计划”强加在埃及人民的身上。这些帝国主义甚至于还妄想颠复社会主义国家，并且对社会主义国家无耻地进行诬蔑，企图转移世界人民对他们侵略埃及的注意。
    但是，帝国主义者是决不能达到他们的目的的。帝国主义者对埃及的侵略已经遭到埃及人民和阿拉伯各国人民的英勇的反抗和亚非人民以及全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的坚决反对。帝国主义者颠复社会主义国家的妄想也遭到了失败。在帝国主义的侵略和进攻下，亚非人民和世界人民的觉悟提高了，他们更加认识到全世界爱好和平的力量加强团结的必要。具有长期斗争经验的中越人民更深刻体会到团结就是力量。我们相信，友好团结的中越两国人民一定能够为亚洲和世界和平做出更大的贡献。
    越南民主共和国万岁！
    中越两国人民的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义国家牢不可破的团结万岁！
    亚非人民、全世界人民团结万岁！
    亚洲和世界和平万岁！
