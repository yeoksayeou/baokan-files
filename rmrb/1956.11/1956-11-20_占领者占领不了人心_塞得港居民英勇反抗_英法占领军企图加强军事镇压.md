Xinhua News Agency, November 19th dispatch from Cairo: Lieutenant General Stockwell, commander of the Anglo-French occupation forces in Port Said, has requested higher authorities to grant him new powers to intensify military control over Port Said in order to further suppress the resistance and non-cooperation of local residents.

The non-cooperative behavior of Port Said residents towards the occupation forces has become a thorny issue for the occupation authorities. Colonel George Evans, the civil affairs officer of the Anglo-French occupation forces, said that the local residents are more "difficult to deal with" than expected.

Evans also said that a public announcement has been drafted to warn the people of Port Said that action will be taken unless their behavior improves. He said that this announcement is now awaiting approval from the highest authorities of the Allied Command.

Since the Anglo-French forces occupied Port Said, the local Egyptian residents, disregarding the persecution by the Anglo-French forces, have resolutely refused to cooperate with them. Shops refuse to open, slogans denouncing the invaders appear daily on walls and sidewalks, and individual collaborators have been sanctioned by patriots.

    英法占领军企图加强军事镇压
    新华社19日讯　开罗消息：塞得港英法占领军司令司托克威尔中将已经要求上级授以新的权力来加紧对塞得港实行军事管制，以便进一步镇压当地居民的反抗和不合作行为。
    塞得港居民对占领军的不合作行为，已经使占领军当局感到棘手，英法占领军的民政官乔治·伊凡斯上校说，当地居民比所预料的更为“难以对付”。
    伊凡斯还说，已经拟定了一项公告来警告塞得港人民，除非他们的行为有改进，否则就要采取行动。他说，这一公告现在正等待联军司令部最高级当局批准。
    自从英法军队占领塞得港以来，当地埃及居民不顾英法军队的迫害，一直坚决拒绝同它们合作。商店拒绝开门营业，在墙上和人行道上每天出现斥责侵略者的口号，个别通敌分子遭到了爱国者的制裁。
