    The Current Situation in Budapest
    By Our Correspondent Hu Sisheng
    From a national perspective, normal life has been established throughout Hungary. In cities other than Budapest, most factories have resumed work, transportation has gradually recovered, and shops are open as usual. In agriculture, field work is progressing normally in most states. In some states, autumn sowing has been completed by three-quarters, and in Vas and Zala counties, it has been completed by 90%. According to reports from various places, most agricultural production cooperatives are still holding their ground, while a small number of cooperatives established by administrative orders have been dissolved. The autumn sowing area of state-owned farms has reached 300,000 holds, exceeding the original plan.
    The current situation in Budapest can be summarized in one sentence: peaceful life has been restored, but normal order has not been fully established. On the one hand, most agencies have started working, some factories, construction workers, transport workers, postal and telecommunications workers have resumed work, food stores continue to operate, and the tense atmosphere in the city has eased; but on the other hand, many factories have not yet resumed work, and some inflammatory reactionary leaflets can still be seen in the city, including leaflets calling on workers not to go to work.
    Because Budapest's population accounts for 18% of Hungary's total population and its industrial production accounts for 60%-70% of Hungary's total, the failure to fully restore normal order in Budapest has a significant impact on the country. An editorial in the "People's Free Press" on November 14 pointed out that this weeks-long work stoppage in Budapest would lead to inflation and national poverty. The editorial also pointed out that the so-called "strike is the unanimous will of the workers" is a shameless lie, because if inflation like in 1945 and 1946 were to occur, the workers would suffer the most. Hungarian Free Trade Union Chairman Gáspár Sándor also called on workers in Budapest who have not resumed work to go to work immediately and pointed out that the vast majority of workers want to work.
    Honest Hungarian patriots are concerned about the further improvement of the situation in Budapest. Therefore, the critical suggestions made by workers at the Budapest Optical Instrument Factory in a letter to the government have attracted attention. The workers at this factory put forward the following five requirements: First, establish a new and strong armed force, and establish three or four divisions in the shortest possible time; second, weapons scattered in various places should be collected and confiscated as soon as possible; third, resolutely stop all counter-revolutionary attempts, including inciting and distributing reactionary leaflets; fourth, report accurate and detailed news to the people every day through newspapers and radio stations; fifth, workers who do not go to work by the 10th will not be given material assistance. Some observers believe that if these suggestions of the workers are implemented, it will obviously help to fully establish normal order in the capital.
    There are reports that Budapest is organizing the National Defense Force and the police. In some districts, these armed forces of the Hungarian people have replaced the Soviet army in maintaining order. At present, the task of these people's armed forces is to maintain order and collect scattered weapons. It is understood that these armed forces will switch to clothing with Hungarian national characteristics. These days, these clothes and police cars painted with the new Kossuth coat of arms can already be seen on the streets of Budapest.
    The situation in Budapest is still developing. International public opinion is closely watching. The Hungarian fascist leader Horthy, who fled to Lisbon, Portugal, also wants to make a comeback, issuing a statement saying that he is willing to "do his part for Hungary." However, one thing is certain now: for the likes of Horthy, the era of him riding a white horse and flaunting his power in Hungary is buried forever. Budapest, 15th

    布达佩斯目前的情况
    本报记者　胡思升
    从全国范围来说，正常生活已经在全匈牙利建立起来。除布达佩斯外的各城市，工厂大部都已复工，交通运输已陆续恢复，商店照常营业。在农业方面，多数州的田野工作进行得很正常。在一些州里，秋播工作完成了四分之三，在伏斯州和查拉州已完成了90％。据各地来的消息说，大部分农业生产合作社仍然坚守着自己的阵地，有少数依靠行政命令手段建立起来的社已经解散了。国营农场的秋播面积已达三十万霍尔德，超过了原订计划。
    布达佩斯目前的情况，概括一句话，就是和平生活已经恢复，但正常秩序还没有全部建立起来。一方面，大多数机关已经开始办公，一部分工厂和建筑工人、运输工人、邮电工人等已经复工，食品商店继续营业，市内紧张气氛已经缓和下来；但另一方面，仍有不少工厂至今没有复工，市内还可以看到一些煽动性的反动传单，包括号召工人不要上工的传单。
    由于布达佩斯的人口占全匈牙利的18％。工业生产占全匈牙利的60％—70％，因此，布达佩斯正常秩序的没有全部恢复，对全国有着不小的影响。11月14日“人民自由报”的社论就指出布达佩斯这种延长数周的停工将导致通货膨胀和国家的贫穷，这篇社论并指出所谓“罢工是工人一致意志”的说法是无耻的撒谎，因为如果像1945年和1946年通货膨胀来临的话，首先受苦的是工人。匈牙利自由工会主席加什帕尔·山道尔也号召布达佩斯没有复工的工人立即上工。并指出绝大多数工人都是想工作的。
    匈牙利正直的爱国者都关心着布达佩斯情况的进一步改善。因此，布达佩斯光学仪器厂工人写给政府的信中所提出的批评性建议引起了人们的注意。这个工厂的工人提出了如下五点要求：第一，建立新的坚强的武装部队，在最短期间内建立三、四个师；第二，应该尽快地搜集和没收流散各处的武器；第三，坚决制止一切反革命的尝试，包括煽动和散发反动传单；第四，每天通过报纸和电台向人民报告确实和详细的消息；第五，到10日为止不上班的工人，不给予物质上的帮助。有人观察，工人的这些建议如果加以贯彻，显然有助于首都正常秩序的全部建立。
    有消息说，布达佩斯正在组织国防军和警察。在一些区，这些匈牙利人民的武装已代替苏军维持秩序。目前这些人民武装的任务是维持秩序和搜罗散落开来的武器。据了解，这些武装部队将改用有匈牙利民族特色的服装。这两天在布达佩斯街上已经可以看到这些服装和绘有新的科苏特国徽的警车。
    布达佩斯的局势还在发展。各国舆论都在密切注视着。逃亡到葡萄牙里斯本的匈牙利法西斯头子霍尔蒂也还想卷土重来，发表声明说什么愿“为匈牙利出一把力”。但是，现在有一点是可以肯定的，对于霍尔蒂之流来说，他在匈牙利骑着白马逞威作福的时代已经永远埋葬掉了。　15日布达佩斯
