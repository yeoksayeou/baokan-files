    Peacock Mountain
    By our reporter Chen Yongjin
    "This black soil is really fertile! Even if you plant firewood sticks, they will blossom. If you plant cotton, the harvest won't be less than in Xinjiang." Liu Xiaosan grabbed a handful of black soil from the ground, smelled it, and said with a smile to the young people around him.
    As soon as I arrived at the youth shock brigade, I asked Liu Xiaosan what the name of the small hill where they lived was. He thought for a long time before saying:
    "This small hill doesn't have a name." After a pause, he added, "Because there are many peacocks on this mountain, some people call it Peacock Mountain."
    "Are there really peacocks?" I asked.
    "Listen!" Xiaosan reminded me to pay attention to the loud "ge ge ga ga" sound, "That's the sound of peacocks. Peacocks call after it rains. We don't have clocks, roosters, or sparrows in our youth reclamation team. These peacocks are the ones who wake us up in the morning. As soon as it's dawn, they start calling 'ge ga ge ga'."
    "Have you seen them?" I asked Liu Xiaosan.
    "We see them almost every day when we're reclaiming the fields. They often fly low over the treetops from this small hill to that small hill. Once, when I went to look at the wasteland over there, several peacocks were displaying their plumage and competing for beauty. I walked within ten steps of them before they flew away. Since we reclaimed this land and planted crops, the peacocks have moved to the south. When the south wind blows, we can hear them even more clearly." After talking about the peacocks for a while, Liu Xiaosan switched to the topic of harvest. He said, "We'll have a bumper harvest this year. Next year, we'll build tile-roofed houses here. There will be a garden to the west and hot springs to the south. In the future, we'll also build houses near the hot springs so we can take baths."
    Who could not be enchanted by this place! This place, which has been occupied by peacocks and other birds and animals since ancient times, has now been visited by some brave young men and women. It is they who have made this land, covered with weeds and forests, grow peanuts, corn, and soybeans; it is they who have made this land grow sugarcane and cotton; it is they who have made this land grow coffee and pineapples, watermelons... How could the peacocks not display their plumage when they saw these new, beautiful young people?
    Here, you can see both the Gaoligong Mountains to the east and the peaceful Nujiang River flowing by. Here, you can also see the fine horses and yellow cattle that the young men and women have brought. Here, you can also hear the "Orchid Flower" tune that the young men and women love to play most.
    Liu Xiaosan's idea of reclaiming wasteland in the borderlands of the motherland was sparked after seeing a movie about the Beijing youth reclamation team reclaiming wasteland in the wilderness of the Great Northern Wilderness. He could no longer settle down in that iron factory. He became fascinated with going to the borderlands of the motherland to reclaim wasteland. In the past, he had dreamed of being a soldier in the People's Liberation Army, wearing a green military uniform, and carrying a light machine gun. At that time, others criticized him, saying that there was no war now, and the work in the factory was as important as being in the army. Later, he was still approved to come to the borderlands.
    There are many difficulties in coming to the borderlands, but for Liu Xiaosan, difficulties mean happiness and joy. What is difficulty? A child who entered the factory at the age of eight and grew up entirely on his own labor, from a cigarette factory to an iron factory, had experienced countless hardships and difficulties. After liberation, especially after he joined the Communist Youth League, his life became as broad as a fish in a tank returning to the Yangtze River and the sea. In January of this year, he and more than four hundred young men and women arrived at the Nujiang River area at the foot of the Gaoligong Mountains at the same time. The four hundred or so people of the youth farm lived in a small village called Xincheng, which only had eighteen families. It was difficult to even find roads here. As soon as you went out, you were met with endless forests. They were so dense that people couldn't even get through them. Underneath the trees was fertile black soil.
    The next day, reclamation officially began. Some comrades were so excited to start reclaiming that they didn't even bother to eat breakfast. But when they arrived in the forest, their enthusiasm immediately cooled down. So many tree stumps, so many thorns, where should they start? This was completely different from the Great Northern Wilderness seen in the movies. Xiaosan was the leader of a production team, and he mobilized everyone to dig out these shrubs and tree stumps according to the farm's instructions. Some of the people who came to reclaim the land were workers, some were students, and some were city residents. Most of them had never planted land, let alone reclaimed wasteland. They didn't know how to use a hoe. The ground was as hard as stone, and the hoe only made a little progress. In this hard black soil, they also encountered ant nests they had never seen before. These ants sometimes crawled into people's pants and stung them like bees. Many people had to run to the side and take off their pants to catch the ants. There were also so many large, gourd-like yellow ant nests in the trees. As soon as you dug up a tree stump, yellow ants would fall on your head, and the ants often stung people's faces until they were swollen. On the first day, Xiaosan's team of sixty-odd people only reclaimed three-tenths of an acre. How insignificant was three-tenths of an acre in this hilly area! Many people also got blisters on their hands; on the third day, many people wrapped their hands and continued to reclaim the land. At night, some of the female comrades even started to cry. They could not see the light in this rich land, and even the strong Xiaosan began to feel that the real difficulties had arrived.
    During their reclamation days, the high tide of rural collectivization and industrial and commercial transformation was constantly transmitted from the radio and the newspapers. This caused them further unease. Some said: If I hadn't come here, I would have joined the cooperative; if I hadn't come here, our factory would have become a joint public-private enterprise; our store would have also become a joint venture.
    At this time, the farm launched a labor competition. Five winning red flags landed in Liu Xiaosan's team.
    In February, the entire farm opened up 500 acres of land, and people's vision became broader. The calluses on people's hands hardened, their cotton seedlings came out, and the agave also survived. One day, farm director Yang Yitang stood in the cotton field and pointed to the slightly more distant hilly area and said to Xiaosan: "We need to transfer a team to open up that piece of wasteland all the way to the Nujiang River. In order to guarantee the completion of the state's reclamation task, our farm needs to establish a shock brigade."
    Xiaosan's mind was shaken. Should our production team go? Here we still have food to eat, and at least we have a house. If we go over there, will the comrades go? Xiaosan made up his mind: Communists are here to overcome difficulties. What difficulties can I, Liu Xiaosan, not overcome? During a break, Xiaosan said to the comrades of his third team:
    "The wasteland nearby has been almost completely reclaimed. The farm has proposed that a production team go out to open up that piece of wasteland to the east. Let's go!"
    "We don't care about the difficulties. Our team must go to the front," several enthusiastic young people immediately expressed to Liu Xiaosan. As long as there are activists, it is easy to handle. Xiaosan surveyed almost all sixty-odd people in the team. He knew that more than twenty people were willing to go, and if he held a meeting to propose it to everyone else, it wouldn't be a problem. Two days later, Xiaosan proposed to everyone to strive to become a youth shock brigade. Everyone expressed their determination to reclaim wasteland on the spot. But after the meeting, several female comrades started to cry. Some said that her bamboo bed had just been made and she was leaving again! Some said that there wasn't even a house in that place, and they had to carry grain to eat from here. Just then, the farm's plan came out, and Xiaosan told everyone about the plan, saying:
    "Our youth reclamation team will open up to the edge of the Nujiang River to the east, and to the Banana Grove River to the south. We will have a bumper harvest this year, and we will build tile-roofed houses next year. The farm's cars will be bought soon, and soon, those who have loved ones can bring their loved ones here, and those who want to get married can register for marriage."
    "The captain should take the lead! The captain should take the lead!" Some people shouted.
    "I don't have one," Xiaosan said.
    "You do! You're just afraid to make it public. It's an eighteen-year-old girl with two braids. She's a student."
    That night, the people of the youth reclamation team also held a dance party to celebrate going to reclaim wasteland on that red soil ridge by the Nujiang River.
    On February 4, Liu Xiaosan led his second production team to the eastern mountain ridge. Xiaosan had come here many times in the past few days. He really liked this piece of land. The water from the mountain could be completely diverted for irrigation. You could harvest as much as you wanted from this land.
    The first job they did here was to cut bamboo and thatch to build houses. They didn't have houses, so this group of young people slept under a large, unnamed tree at night. Although they were tired from the day, they still played the harmonica, erhu, and flute until midnight. To prevent attacks by wild animals, they made a pile of fire by the tree. The comrades fell asleep, but Xiaosan still couldn't close his eyes. Although it was February, and although they were under the open sky, some people still kicked their quilts to the side. Xiaosan would get up from time to time to check on those who had kicked off their quilts and cover them again. As soon as it dawned, Xiaosan was awakened by the "ge ga ge ga" calls of the nearby peacocks. The comrades got up early, some cut bamboo, and some thatched. While they were thatching, several peacocks displayed their plumage nearby. How beautiful! Where could you find such a good place? Someone said: In the future, when we have more income and our homes are built, we must catch a few small peacocks and raise them in the garden.
    Brave people are happier in hard times. On the night of the 30th, the male comrades' houses had not yet been built, and a strong wind came with heavy rain. The small thatched houses creaked in the wind. It was raining outside, and it was raining inside. The quilts and clothes were all wet. These young men and women sang the song "Marching into the Wasteland" in the rhythm of the storm. Xiaosan was so happy to hear these people singing that he couldn't close his mouth. He thought silently: There's no problem, what difficulties are we afraid of with these good young people.
    Unexpected difficulties fell on their heads again. Those tomb-like mounds under the bushes were all ant nests. Very thick trees were bitten to death by them. People had to dig out the tree roots, which were as dense as spider webs, level the ant nests, break them up, and burn the ants. They could only open up such a small piece of wasteland in a day.
    Farm director Yang Yitang came to this new land. This mature leader of the youth reclamation team expressed his dissatisfaction with Liu Xiaosan. He said, "You were opening up one acre a day with ten people over there. Why are you opening up so little here?"
    The seventh team and the fourth team were transferred to help them. When these young people saw that the second production team had only opened up six acres of land in five days, they deliberately teased them, saying:
    "Your winning team is not simple. You are the banner of the entire farm!"
    On the first day, several comrades from the fourth and seventh teams broke their hoes, and some people couldn't even dig up a tree stump in a day. The farm director asked them to revise their plan. Xiaosan ran to the nearby Unity Agricultural Cooperative to ask them how they dug up tree stumps here. The people of the Unity Cooperative taught them to dig up the tree roots first and then lift them with large wooden sticks. This method doubled their work efficiency.
    By the time I arrived at Peacock Mountain, the glorious title of "Youth Shock Brigade" had already fallen on Liu Xiaosan's team, and Liu Xiaosan's lover had sent endless encouragement from the Honghe River.
    It is the hands of brave young people that have made the Hengduan Mountains more colorful. In this place, as in many places, life is boiling. Here, the songs of young men and women are sung from morning to night, until late at night. The songs, along with the calls of the peacocks, sing the praises of this brave labor and creation.

    孔雀山

    “这黑土地可真肥呀！栽上木柴棒子也会开花，如果种棉花的话，不会比新疆少收”。刘小三从地上抓了一把黑土，放在鼻子上闻了闻笑着对他周围的几个小青年说。
    我一到青年突击队就问刘小三他们住的小山包叫什么山？他想了半天才说：
    “这个小山包没有名字。”停了不大会又说：“因为这个山上孔雀多，有人叫它孔雀山。”
    “真有孔雀吗？”我问。
    “你听！”小三提醒我注意那高昂地咯咯嘎嘎的声音，“这就是孔雀的叫声。孔雀在下罢雨后就叫；我们这青年垦荒队里没有钟表，也没有公鸡和麻雀，早晨喊醒我们起床的就是这些孔雀。天一亮就咯嘎咯嘎的叫起来。”
    “你们看到过吗？”我问刘小三。
    “我们在田里开荒几乎天天看到，它常常低低地扫着树稍从这个小山包飞到那个小山包。有一次我到那边看荒地，几个孔雀正在一块开屏比美，我走得离它十来步远才飞走。从我们把这片地开了荒种上庄稼，孔雀搬到南边。南风一吹就听得更清楚。”刘小三谈了一会孔雀就转到丰收上来，他说：“今年丰收了，明年这里就会盖瓦房，西面是花园，南面是温泉，将来在温泉那里也要盖上房子，好洗澡。”
    谁能不迷这块地方呢！这自古以来就为孔雀和其他鸟兽所占据的地方，现在来了一些勇敢的青年小伙子和姑娘，是他们使这块长满荒草和丛林的土地长了花生，玉米和大豆；是他们使这块土地长了甘蔗和棉花；是他们使这块土地长出了咖啡和波萝、西瓜……。孔雀见了这些新来的漂亮的青年人们能不开屏吗。
    在这里，你同时可以看到东边的高黎贡山和平静的怒江流水；在这里你同时可以看到青年男女们牵来的骏马和黄牛，在这里你还可以听到青年男女们最爱吹奏的“兰花花”曲子。
    刘小三想到祖国边疆开荒的念头，是看到北京的青年垦荒队在北大荒的原野上开荒的电影后引起的，他再也不能在那个铁工厂里安定下来了。他入迷地想去祖国的边疆开荒。在以往他曾梦想着当个解放军穿上绿色的军衣，扛上一挺轻机枪。当时别人批评他，说现在又不打仗，工厂里的活和在军队里一样重要。后来他还是被批准到边疆来了。
    到边疆困难是很多的，但对刘小三来说，困难就意味着幸福和快乐。什么是困难呢？一个从八岁就进到工厂里全靠自己劳动长大的孩子，从纸烟厂到打铁厂，苦头困难不知经过了多少，解放了，特别从他参加青年团后，他的生活真像水缸的鱼儿回到长江大海一样宽广。今年1月间，他跟四百多青年男女，同时到达了高黎贡山下的怒江地区。青年农场的四百来人就住在叫作新城?的一个才有十八家人家的小村子上。在这里连道路都很难找到，一出门就是一眼望不尽的树林子。密得连人也钻不进去，林木的下面是肥沃的黑土。
    第二天，开荒正式开始了。有些同志听到动手开荒了，连早饭也没顾得吃。一到那树林里，人们的热情顿时冷下来了，那么多树头，那么多荆棘，到底从那里下手呢？这和电影上看到的北大荒完全不同。小三是生产队的一个队长，他动员大家按着场里的指示把这些灌木、树头刨掉。这些来开荒的人们有的是工人，有的是学生、市民，大多数没种过地，更没开过荒，他们不知道镢头怎么用。地硬得像石头一样，镢头下去只开得一点点。在这坚硬的黑土里，又出现了未曾见过的黑蚂蚁窝。这些蚂蚁有时钻到人的裤子里，像蜂子一样的刺人，很多人要跑到一边脱下裤子捉蚂蚁，树上也有那么多像大葫芦一样大的黄蚂蚁窝，只要刨树疙瘩，黄蚂蚁就会落在头上来，蚂蚁往往把人的脸刺肿。第一天小三队的六十多个人才开了三分地。三分地在这块丘陵地带该是多么渺小啊！好多人的手上还磨出了血泡；第三天不少人把手包起来开荒。夜里有的女同志居然啼哭起来了。她们在这块富饶的土地上看不到光明，连坚强的小三也开始感到困难真正的到来了。
    就在他们开荒的日子，农村合作化，工商业改造的高潮从收音机里，从报纸上不断传来。这又引起了他们的不安。有的说：要不来这里自己也参加合作社了；要不来这里，我们工厂也公私合营了；我们的商店也合营了。
    就在这时候，农场里提出了劳动竞赛的号召。五个优胜红旗落在刘小三队里三个。
    二月里，全场开了五百亩田，人们的目光看得远了。人们手上的茧老了，他们种的棉花苗苗出来了，龙舌兰也活了。有一天场长杨一堂站在棉花田里指着较远一点的丘陵地带对小三说：“我们需要调出一个队把那片片荒地开出来，直到怒江边。”为了保证完成国家的开荒任务，我们场里需要成立个突击队。
    小三的思想震动了，我们这个生产队是不是去呢？这里还有饭吃，总算有个房子，要到那边去同志们是不是去呢？小三思想一横：共产党员就是来克服困难的，我刘小三有什么困难不能克服呢？休息的时候小三向他们第三队的同志说：
    “这附近的荒地开得差不多了，场里提出要一个生产队出去开东面那片片荒地，我们这个队去吧！”
    “管他困难不困难，我们这个队要搞到前面去。”有几个积极的小青年当场就向刘小三表示了。只要有了积极分子就好办，小三几乎把全队六十来个人全部调查了一遍，他知道有二十多个人愿意去，其他人，如果开个会向大家提出也会不成问题。两天后，小三向大家提出争取当个青年突击队。当场大家都表示了要去开荒的决心。可是会后却有几个女同志哭起来了。有的说她的小竹床刚刚做好就又走啦！有的说到那块地方连个房子也没有，吃饭得从这里扛粮食。正在这时候，场里的规划出来了，小三给大家讲了规划说：
    “我们青年垦荒队东边要开到怒江边，南面要开到芭蕉林河，今年丰收了，明年就要盖瓦房，我们场里的汽车等不了多久就买来了，等不了多久，有爱人的就可把爱人接来，愿意结婚的就登记结婚。”
    “队长带头，队长带头。”有些人嚷嚷着。
    “我没有。”小三说。
    “有啦！还不敢公开，是一个十八岁的姑娘，扎着两个辫子，是个学生。”
    这天晚上，青年垦荒队的人们还为到怒江边的那片红土岗岗上开荒举行了跳舞晚会。
      2月4日，刘小三带着他的第二生产队往东面山岗岗上来了。在这几天以前小三来过好多次，他可真喜欢这片土地，山上的水完全可以引下来灌溉，这样的土地，真是想叫它收多少就能收多少。
    他们来到这里的第一个工作，就是砍竹子割茅草盖房子。没有房子，夜里他们这一伙青年睡在一棵不知名的大树下。虽然疲惫了一天，他们还是吹口琴、拉二胡、吹笛子，直到半夜还不睡。为了防备野兽的袭击，在树边弄了一堆火。同志们睡着了，小三还是合不上眼。虽然是二月，虽然在无遮拦的树下，有些人还把被子蹬在一边，小三一会起来瞧瞧给那些蹬开被子的人再盖上。天刚亮，小三就为近边的咯嘎咯嘎孔雀叫声喊醒了。同志们早早地起来，有的砍竹子，有的割茅草。正割茅草的时候，几只孔雀在近边开屏了，多美呀！往哪里找这样的好地方呢？有人说：将来收入多了，家园盖好了，一定要抓几只小孔雀养在花园里。
    勇敢的人在艰苦的日子里显得更快乐。30日的夜晚，男同志的房子还没盖好，狂风卷着大雨来了，小草房被风吹得吱吱叫唤，外面下，屋里也下，被子、衣服都被淋湿了，这些男女青年们都在狂风暴雨的节奏里唱起向荒地进军的歌子来。小三听到这些人的歌声乐得合不上嘴，他默默地想着：没问题了，有这些好青年还怕什么困难。
    没有料想到的困难又降落到他们的头上来。那些灌木丛下的像坟头样的土堆，都是蚂蚁窝。很粗的树木被他们咬死了。人们要把那密如蛛网的树根刨下来把那蚂蚁窝铲平打碎，把蚂蚁烧掉。一天仅仅开那么一点荒地。
    场长杨一堂到这块新地上来，这个老成的青年垦荒队的领导人表现了对刘小三的不满，他说：“你们在那边十个人一天开一亩，到这里怎么开这样一点点。”
    第七队和第四队调来帮助他们了。这些青年们一看第二生产队五天才开了六亩地，故意逗他们说：
    “你们这优胜队可不简单，你们可是全场的旗帜啦！”
    第四第七队的同志第一天就有几个把镢头刨坏了，有的人一天还刨不掉一个树疙瘩。场长叫他们修订计划。小三跑到近处的团结农业合作社里，问他们在这里怎样刨树疙瘩。团结社的人教他们先把树根刨掉，然后用大木棍子掀。这个办法使他们工作效率提高了一倍。
    我到孔雀山的日子，“青年突击队”的光荣称号已经落在刘小三的队里了，刘小三的爱人从红河边寄来了无限鼓舞的情意。
    是勇敢的青年的双手，使横断山多采了。在这个地方像很多地方一样，生活在沸腾着。在这里，年青小伙子和姑娘的歌声，从早唱到晚，唱到深夜。歌声和着孔雀的叫声，歌唱着这勇敢的劳动和创造。
