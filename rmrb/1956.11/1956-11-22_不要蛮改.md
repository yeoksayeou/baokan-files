    "Don't Arbitrarily Change It"
    Lin Ruji
    Last month, I wrote an article for a literary journal discussing Mr. Lu Xun's essays (titled "The Ideological and Artistic Characteristics of Lu Xun's Essays"). In it, I quoted a passage from Lu Xun's "Essays Written in a Makeshift Shelter," specifically from "Post-Illness Musings," which included the original sentence: "Now, they are posing as the remnants of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, holding grudges like the Ming Dynasty loyalists." Every character here was copied exactly from the complete collection of Lu Xun's works. Although I did consider at the time that using the word "Manchu" might be inappropriate now, since it was Mr. Lu Xun's original text from over twenty years ago, and his and my article's intention was not focused on this point, I thought it was not a problem at all. However, when the journal was printed, I saw that "Manchu Qing" had been changed to "Former Qing." Looking at the returned manuscript after it was printed by the editorial department, I realized that it was the editor who had made the change. How ridiculous! Even when quoting the words of predecessors, one must follow today's new rules and modify them! Our 1956 editorial comrades are even changing Mr. Lu Xun's words from 1934; this should be considered a strange event in this year's commemoration of the 20th anniversary of Lu Xun's death.
    If I were to criticize this editor, he might plausibly argue: I am complying with the superior's notification that the term "Manchu Qing" should not be used in future articles. But one only needs to retort: that refers to not using it now, not requiring that even when quoting previous texts, one must avoid and alter it.
    Failing to distinguish between conditions and time, and not handling issues according to specific circumstances, but mechanically and dogmatically implementing certain instructions, even an editor changing a single character in an article can become a problem.
    According to the self-imposed rules of this editor, if all instances of "Manchu Qing" in past texts should be changed, I really don't know what will happen to the soon-to-be-published collection of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's writings. Changing "Manchu Qing" to "Former Qing" in writings after the 1911 Revolution might seem barely acceptable, but how should Sun Yat-sen's writings before the 1911 Revolution be changed? To "Present Qing"? I would like to ask this overly pedantic editor, and ask him to try looking at such a modified article to see if he wouldn't burst out laughing!
    I am not afraid that readers will misunderstand that I would boldly change Mr. Lu Xun's original text, and thus am using this joke to declare myself innocent. I want to raise a more important issue about editors arbitrarily changing manuscripts, which is worthy of their attention and everyone's discussion.
    I really want to make this request to some editors: "Don't arbitrarily change it!"
    Postscript: After finishing this short article, I saw He Xiangning's "Fragments of Memories of Mr. Sun Yat-sen" published in the People's Daily on October 29th, in which the term "Manchu Qing" appeared several times, which answered my incidentally raised small question, and also illustrated that such dogmatic editors are relatively unusual.

### “不要蛮改”

    “不要蛮改”
    林如稷
    上月我为一个文艺刊物写了一篇谈鲁迅先生杂文的文章（题名为“鲁迅杂文的思想与艺术特点”），内中引用鲁迅先生“且介亭杂文”里“病后余谈”上面的一段话，中间有一句原文是“现在以明遗老之仇的满清的遗老自居”。这里每一个字都是照鲁迅全集本钞录的。当时我虽然也想到那个“满”字现在要用是不妥的，但那既是鲁迅先生二十几年前的原文，并且他的和我的文章本意也不在这上面，所以认为是毫无问题。但刊物印出来之后，一看“满清”变为“前清”了，原稿由编辑部印后寄回时再看，更知道是编辑同志所改。这是怎样的可笑，连引用前人的文字也必须遵照今日的新规去把它修改过！我们1956年的编辑同志，会追改到1934年鲁迅先生的文字；这也要算今年纪念鲁迅逝世20周年中一件奇事吧。
    我这样责难这位编辑同志，他似乎很可如此辩解的：我是在遵守上级的通报，说今后文章中不要用“满清”字样呀。但只须再这样反问一句，那是说现在不要用，不是要求今日引用前人文句也要避免而为之改过呢。
    不分清条件时间，不依照具体情况来处理问题，只是机械地、教条主义地执行某项指示，连当编辑人修改文章里一个字也可以成问题的。
    照这位编辑同志自立的清规戒律，如果过去的文字中所用“满清”字样都应改过，我真不知不久要印行的孙中山先生文集该是怎样？写在辛亥以后的“满清”字样改为“前清”还似乎勉强可以过去，那孙先生写在辛亥革命以前的又如何改呢？改为“今清”吗？我想请教于这位过于拘泥的编者，并请他拿那样改过的文章来试看一下，是不是会哑然失笑！
    我并不是为了恐怕读者误会我会胆大妄改鲁迅先生的原文，便借这笑话来自行声明，我是想提出一个较重要的关于编辑同志妄改文稿的问题，这是值得他们注意和大家来讨论的。
    我真要向有些编辑同志提出这样一个请求：“不要蛮改”！
    附记：短文写完，看到10月29日的人民日报登载的何香凝先生的“对中山先生的片段回忆”，文中“满清”字样数见，算是回答了我那附带引起的小疑问，也说明了那样教条主义的编辑，是较为特殊的。
