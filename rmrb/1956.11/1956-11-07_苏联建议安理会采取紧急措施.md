Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 6th. Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov wrote a letter to the President of the United Nations Security Council, Jalal Abdoh, on November 5th.

The letter stated that Egypt is suffering from aggression by Britain, France, and Israel. The number of peaceful residents sacrificing their lives is increasing, and material wealth is being destroyed. Although the emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on November 2nd made a decision to cease military action and withdraw all foreign troops that have invaded Egypt, the war of aggression against Egypt is intensifying.

The current situation dictates that the United Nations must take urgent and effective measures to stop the aggression. If, at this critical juncture, the United Nations is unable to stop the aggressors, it will lose the trust of the people of the world, and its lofty ideals and principles will be damaged beyond repair.

The Soviet government requests that the Security Council convene an immediate meeting to discuss the following issue: "The question of the British, French, and Israeli governments' failure to implement the resolution made by the emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, and the question of taking urgent measures to stop the aforementioned countries' aggression against Egypt."

The letter put forward a Soviet proposal. The proposal stated, "The Security Council notes that the recommendation adopted by the emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on November 2, 1956, that the governments of Britain, France, and Israel immediately cease military action against Egypt and withdraw their troops from Egypt has not been implemented by the aforementioned countries, and military action against Egypt is continuing.

Believes that urgent measures must be taken to stop the aggression against Egypt launched by Britain, France, and Israel.

Recommends that the governments of the United Kingdom, France, and Israel immediately cease all military action against Egypt within twelve hours from the time of the adoption of this resolution, and withdraw the troops invading Egyptian territory within three days.

If Britain, France, and Israel do not implement this resolution within the specified period, then, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, all member states of the United Nations, especially the permanent members of the Security Council with strong air and naval forces, the United States and the Soviet Union, it is necessary to provide military assistance and other assistance to the Republic of Egypt, which has been subjected to aggression, that is, to send naval and air forces, army units, volunteer forces, instructors, and supply military equipment or other kinds of assistance.”

The letter stated that the Soviet government declares that it is willing to contribute its share to stop the aggressors and defend the victims of aggression, and is willing to work with everyone to send the necessary air and naval forces to Egypt for this purpose to restore peace.

The Soviet government expressed its firm conviction that the member states of the United Nations will take necessary measures to safeguard Egypt's sovereignty and restore peace.

The letter finally requested that the Soviet government's letter be distributed to all members of the Security Council and all other member states of the United Nations.

    苏联建议安理会采取紧急措施
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫11月5日给联合国安全理事会主席贾拉尔·阿卜杜写了一封信。
    信中说，埃及遭受到英、法和以色列的侵略，和平居民牺牲的人数越来越增加，物质财富在毁灭。虽然联合国大会11月2日紧急会议作出了关于停止军事行动和撤出所有已经侵入埃及的外国军队的决定，但是侵略埃及的战争越来越激烈。
    目前的局势决定了联合国必须采取紧急的有效措施以制止侵略。假如在这个紧要关头，联合国没有能力制止侵略者，那末它就会失去全世界人民的信任，而它的崇高的理想和原则将被损坏无余。
    苏联政府要求安理会立即召开会议讨论下列问题：“关于英国、法国和以色列政府不履行联合国大会紧急会议所作出的决议的问题，关于采取紧急措施以制止上述国家侵略埃及的问题”。
    信中提出了苏联的一个提案。提案说，“安全理事会注意到，联合国大会1956年11月2日紧急会议所通过的建议英国、法国和以色列政府立即停止对埃及的军事行动以及把他们的军队撤出埃及的决议没有被上述国家所执行，对埃及的军事行动还在继续。
    认为必须采取紧急措施制止英国、法国、以色列发动的对埃及的侵略。
    建议英国、法国和以色列三国政府从通过本决议的时候起立即在十二小时内停止对埃及的一切军事行动，并且在三天之内撤出侵入埃及领土的军队。
    如果英、法和以色列不在限定的期间内执行本决议，那么，根据联合国宪章，联合国所有成员国，首先是拥有强大空军和海军的安全理事会常任理事国美国和苏联，有必要向遭受侵略的埃及共和国提供军事援助和其他援助，即派遣海军和空军、陆军部队、志愿军、教官，供给军事装备或其他种类的援助。”
    信中说，苏联政府声明，它愿贡献自己的一份力量去制止侵略者，保卫侵略的受害者，愿和大家协力为这个目的派遣必要的空军和海军到埃及去恢复和平。
    苏联政府表示深信，联合国会员国将采取必要措施来维护埃及的主权和恢复和平。
    这封信最后要求把苏联政府的这封信分发给安全理事会全体理事国和联合国所有其他会员国。
