    Using the Pretext of "Defensive Alert," Harboring Evil Intentions
    The United States Strengthens Military Deployments Worldwide
    According to Xinhua News Agency reports, the United States authorities are strengthening their military deployments worldwide. This deployment began after the U.S. Department of Defense issued orders on November 7 to the commanders of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed around the world to strengthen their so-called "defensive alert."
    According to an Associated Press report on the 8th, the Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet has ordered all warships and troops to be on "alert" status around the clock. A task force belonging to this fleet has already sailed to an undisclosed destination.
    Meanwhile, according to a U.S. Navy spokesman on the 9th, naval ships and aircraft based at ports on the U.S. West Coast have been ordered to prepare "for immediate deployment should the tense situation in the Middle East require it." U.S. First Fleet Commander Dennison said that some ships of the Pacific Fleet have been ordered to "stand by," "ready to sail to the Western Pacific."
    According to an Associated Press report, on the 9th, the Pacific Fleet ordered a partial news blackout on the movements of ships: ship departures will not be announced in advance, but only after the fact. This order specifically concerns aircraft carriers.
    In the Mediterranean, the United States has also strengthened its military power. International News Service said that the U.S. Sixth Fleet will add two aircraft carriers carrying atomic bombers. At the same time, at a large U.S. heavy bomber base in Saudi Arabia, all leaves have been cancelled in order to be "ready for any unexpected events that may occur in this Arab country."
    According to International News Service reports, as of the 10th, more than 100,000 U.S. troops stationed in the Far East have entered a war "alert status." A spokesman for the so-called "U.S. Taiwan Defense Command" in Taiwan also said that the U.S. military and the Chiang Kai-shek troops have adopted a "posture of alert."

    借口“防御戒备”　怀抱不良企图
    美国在世界各地加强军事部署
    据新华社讯　美国当局正在世界各地加强它的军事部署。这次部署是从11月7日美国国防部向美国驻在世界各地的海陆空军司令官们发出加强所谓“防御戒备”的命令后开始的。
    据美联社8日消息，美国大西洋舰队司令已经下令所有的战舰和部队整日处于“戒备”状态。属于这一舰队的一支特遣舰队已经驶往未经宣布的目的地。
    同时，据美国海军发言人在9日透露，以美国西海岸各港口为基地的海军舰只和飞机已奉命进行准备，“以便一旦中东紧张局势需要时立即进行部署”。美国第一舰队司令丹尼逊说，太平洋舰队的某些舰只已奉命“戒备”，“准备驶往西太平洋去”。
    据美联社报道，太平洋舰队在9日命令对舰只的行动实行部分的消息封锁：事先不宣布舰只出发消息，而只是在事后公布出动情况。这个命令特别涉及航空母舰。
    在地中海方面，美国也加强了它的军力。国际新闻社说，美国第六舰队将增加两艘带原子轰炸机的航空母舰。同时，在沙特阿拉伯的一个美国大型重轰炸机基地已经取消了一切休假，以便“随时准备应付这个阿拉伯国家中可能发生的任何意外”。
    据国际新闻社报道，到10日为止，驻扎在远东的十万多美军已经进入战争“戒备状态”。在台湾的所谓“美军协防台湾司令部”发言人也说，美军和蒋军已经采取了“戒备姿态”。
