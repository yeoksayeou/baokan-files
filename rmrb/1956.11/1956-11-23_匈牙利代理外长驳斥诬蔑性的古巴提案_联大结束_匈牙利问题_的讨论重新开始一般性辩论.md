Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd, dispatch from TASS, New York, November 21st: The Acting Foreign Minister of Hungary, Mr. Szebes, sent a telegram to the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Hammarskjöld, strongly refuting the so-called proposal put forward by the Cuban delegation at the 11th session of the UN General Assembly, which demanded that the Soviet Union and Hungary "cease the deportation of Hungarian youth to the Soviet Union."

Szebes stated in the telegram: "Due to the events of recent weeks, it is absolutely necessary for Hungary to isolate those fascist terrorists, anti-social agitators, and armed bandits who appear near factories from time to time, threaten workers, and use terror to prevent them from going to work, and to eliminate the large numbers of robbers, thieves, fugitives, and other criminals who hinder the restoration of domestic law and order and threaten social security and peace. Therefore, the Hungarian authorities and the military forces performing police functions have made arrests. The case of each arrested person is being thoroughly investigated, and if it is determined that someone has not committed serious crimes and anti-social activities, he will be released quickly. This has been the situation up to now. If the investigation results show that the arrested person has committed a serious crime, then he will be handed over to the procuratorial organs and courts under their jurisdiction so that criminal proceedings can be brought against him. Despite all kinds of malicious rumors, not a single arrested person has been sent outside Hungary."

The telegram stated that the government of the Hungarian People's Republic declares that the Cuban proposal is based only on malicious rumors spread by those who are hostile to the Hungarian People's Republic. The telegram requested Hammarskjöld to announce this statement at the 11th session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd, dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly continued its meeting on the morning and afternoon of November 21st to discuss the "Hungarian Question." The meeting passed the three proposals before the Assembly.

One proposal was the so-called "deportation of Hungarian citizens" proposal put forward by Cuba. The General Assembly passed this proposal with 55 votes in favor, 10 votes against, and 14 abstentions. The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and the People's Democratic countries voted against it, and India, Egypt, Indonesia, and Finland abstained. As Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov pointed out at the meeting, during the discussion of this proposal, neither those who put forward this proposal nor those who supported it were able to present any facts to substantiate their unfounded accusations.

Syrian representative Zeineddine, who abstained from voting on the Cuban proposal, made an urgent appeal to the Assembly during the debate, requesting the Assembly not to dwell on the "Hungarian Question" and should immediately consider the "imminent" acts of aggression by Britain, France, and Israel against Syria.

Zeineddine said that he was ordered to "present these facts to the Security Council and the General Assembly. The Syrian government requests the Assembly to consider this issue immediately."

Another representative who abstained from voting on the Cuban proposal, Rizk of Lebanon, said that Lebanon has always been willing to stand at the forefront in the struggle for freedom anywhere. But he complained that the United Nations has always been hesitant to support such struggles in Algeria, Egypt, and Cyprus. He asked: "Are the lives of Algerians, Egyptians, and Cypriots not as valuable as the lives of Hungarians?"

The second proposal was a proposal put forward by India, Indonesia, and Ceylon. This proposal requested Hungary to agree to allow the United Nations Secretary-General to appoint observers to enter Hungary for investigation "without prejudice to Hungarian sovereignty."

The voting results for the proposal of India, Indonesia, and Ceylon were: 57 votes in favor, 8 votes against, and 14 abstentions. Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, and the Soviet Union voted against it. Chile, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, Jordan, Panama, Paraguay, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, Yugoslavia, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique abstained.

The head of the delegation of the Hungarian People's Republic, Horvath, said that according to the instructions of the government, he opposed the proposal of India, Indonesia, and Ceylon. He added that the Hungarian government is ready to hold talks with the United Nations Secretary-General at any time on issues related to helping Hungary.

The third proposal was a proposal put forward by the United States, Argentina, Belgium, and Denmark. This proposal requested the United Nations Secretary-General and member states to provide "care" and "resettlement" for Hungarian "refugees" abroad.

When speaking in support of this proposal, US representative Nolan insisted that "those who have left Hungary do not want to return home," and that "the free countries of the world will never agree" to let Hungarian citizens who are now wandering abroad return to Hungary.

Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov spoke on this proposal. He pointed out that this proposal showed that someone was forcing Hungarians to abandon their motherland and "sever their ties with their motherland."

Shepilov analyzed the situation of the so-called "refugees": The Hungarian "refugees" mentioned in the proposal are actually those fascist bandits who fled abroad after committing heinous crimes against the Hungarian people, most of whom were fascist elements who entered Hungary in the first few days of the rebellion. Obviously, it violates the UN Charter to place this criminal group, which has committed heinous crimes against the Hungarian people, under the protection of the United Nations as "refugees." ...However, a group of truly patriotic Hungarian citizens who had to take refuge abroad during the riots are also currently abroad because the fascist rioters did not provide security even to the most peaceful people. The United Nations should show appropriate concern for these Hungarians and enable them to return to their motherland as soon as possible. Many Hungarian citizens who are still abroad now know the actual situation, and they all demand to return to their motherland.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Horvath disagreed with this proposal. He proposed an amendment to the proposal of the United States, Argentina, and other countries, requesting all countries to take rapid measures to ensure the return of refugees. However, this amendment was rejected by the General Assembly.

The voting results for the proposal of the United States and Argentina and other countries were: 69 votes in favor, 2 votes against, and 8 abstentions. Hungary and Romania voted against it. Poland, the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, and Sudan abstained.

The General Assembly's discussion on the "Hungarian Question" ended here, and it was decided to resume the general debate of the delegations of various countries that evening.

    匈牙利代理外长驳斥诬蔑性的古巴提案
    联大结束“匈牙利问题”的讨论重新开始一般性辩论
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社纽约21日讯：匈牙利代理外交部长谢贝什打给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德一份电报，严正驳斥古巴代表团在联合国大会第十一届会议上提出的所谓要求苏联和匈牙利“停止把匈牙利青年流放到苏联去”的提案。
    谢贝什在电报中说：“由于最近几周的事件，匈牙利绝对有必要隔离那些不时出现在工厂附近、威胁工人并对他们施行恐怖手段以阻挠他们上工的法西斯恐怖分子、反社会活动的煽动分子和武装匪徒，清除那些阻挠国内法律和秩序的恢复、威胁社会安全和和平的大批强盗、窃贼、逃犯和其他刑事犯。因此，匈牙利当局和执行警察职能的军事部队进行了逮捕。对每一个被捕者的案件在进行周密的调查，如果确定某人没有严重罪行和反社会活动，就会把他迅速释放。到现在为止的情况就是这样。如果调查结果表明被捕者犯有严重罪行，那末就把他交给职权所属的检察机关和法院，以便对他提出刑事诉讼。尽管有种种别有用心的谣言，而事实上并没有一个被捕者被送往匈牙利国外”。
    电报中说，匈牙利人民共和国政府声明，古巴提案的根据只是那些敌视匈牙利人民共和国的人发出的别有用心的谣言。电报要求哈马舍尔德把这个声明在联合国大会第十一届会议上宣布。
    据新华社22日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会11月21日上午和下午继续举行会议，讨论“匈牙利问题”。会议通过了摆在大会面前的三项提案。
    一项提案是古巴提出的所谓“匈牙利公民被流放”的提案。大会以五十五票赞成，十票反对和十四票弃权通过了这项提案。投反对票的是苏联、南斯拉夫和各人民民主国家，弃权的有印度、埃及、印度尼西亚等国家和芬兰。正如苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫在会上所指出的，在讨论这个提案的时候，无论是提出这个提案的人或者是那些支持这个提案的人，都没有能够提出任何事实来证实自己的毫无根据的指责。
    对古巴提案投弃权票的叙利亚代表宰尼丁在辩论过程中向大会紧急呼吁，要求大会不要在“匈牙利问题”上议论不休，而应该马上考虑英、法和以色列对叙利亚的“迫在眉睫”的侵略行动。
    宰尼丁说，他奉命“向安全理事会和大会提出这些事实。叙利亚政府要求大会马上考虑这个问题”。
    另一个对古巴提案投弃权票的代表，黎巴嫩的里兹克说，黎巴嫩在任何地方争取自由的斗争中总是愿意站在最前列的。但是他抱怨说，联合国对于支持阿尔及利亚、埃及和塞浦路斯的这种斗争一向是迟疑不前的。他问道：“难道阿尔及利亚人、埃及人和塞浦路斯人的生命没有匈牙利人的生命那样宝贵吗？”
    第二项提案是印度、印度尼西亚和锡兰三国提出的提案。这项提案要求匈牙利答应联合国秘书长在“不妨害匈牙利主权的情况下”，让秘书长指派观察员进入匈牙利进行调查。
    印度、印度尼西亚和锡兰三国提案的表决结果是：五十七票赞成，八票反对，十四票弃权。投反对票的是阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、乌克兰、苏联，弃权的是智利、古巴、多米尼加共和国、埃及、埃塞俄比亚、约旦、巴拿马、巴拉圭、波兰、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、也门、南斯拉夫和蒋介石分子。
    匈牙利人民共和国代表团团长霍瓦特说，根据政府的指示，他反对印度、印度尼西亚和锡兰的提案。他补充说，匈牙利政府准备随时同联合国秘书长就有关帮助匈牙利的问题进行会谈。
    第三个提案是美国、阿根廷、比利时和丹麦提出的一项提案。这项提案要求联合国秘书长和各会员国对匈牙利在国外的“难民”予以“照顾”，并且“重新安置”他们。
    美国代表诺兰在发言支持这个提案时，硬说“那些离开匈牙利的人是不想回国的”，“全世界的自由国家决不同意”让现在流落在国外的匈牙利公民返回匈牙利去。
    苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫就这个提案发了言。他指出，这个提案表明了，有人正在强迫匈牙利人背弃祖国，“使他们与祖国断绝关系”。
    谢皮洛夫对所说的“难民”的情况进行分析说：提案中所说的匈牙利“难民”实际上是那些在对匈牙利人民犯了滔天罪行以后逃往国外的法西斯匪帮，其中大部分是在叛乱的头几天进入匈牙利的法西斯分子。显然，把这种对匈牙利人民犯过滔天罪行的犯罪集团作为“难民”置于联合国的保护下是违反联合国宪章的。……但是，在骚乱期间不得不到外国去避难的一批真正爱国的匈牙利公民目前也在国外，因为法西斯骚乱分子甚至对最和平的人民都不给予安全。联合国对这些匈牙利人应当表示适当的关怀，使他们尽快返回祖国。到现在还在国外的许多匈牙利公民已经知道实际情况，他们都要求返回祖国。
    匈牙利外交部长霍瓦特不同意这个提案。他对美国和阿根廷等国的提案提出一项修正案，要求所有国家采取迅速措施保证难民回国。但是这项修正案遭到大会否决。
    美国和阿根廷等国提案的表决结果是：六十九票赞成，两票反对，八票弃权。匈牙利和罗马尼亚投反对票。波兰、苏联、乌克兰、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克和苏丹弃权。
    大会关于“匈牙利问题”的讨论至此结束，并且决定在当天晚上重新开始进行各国代表团的一般辩论。
