Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 26th: Since the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed the National Preferential Pension Law in mid-July, more than 10 million people in the Russian Federal Republic alone have enjoyed the benefits of the newly established higher standard of preferential pensions by the beginning of October. From the beginning of October to mid-November, more than 310,000 people who had not previously enjoyed preferential pensions received them.
　　This was stated by Muravyeva, Minister of Social Security of the Russian Federal Republic, to Soviet and foreign journalists in Moscow on November 24.
　　Muravyeva also said that in 1955, Soviet residents received a total of 154 billion rubles in state subsidies, an increase of 32 billion rubles compared with 1950. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the state spent 689 billion rubles in this area. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, this will increase to approximately 970 billion rubles.
　　Muravyeva said that with the development of socialist countries, the continuous growth of social labor productivity, and the continuous increase in national income, the Soviet government is allocating more and more funds to guarantee the lives of people who have lost their ability to work. For example, the social insurance budget in 1955 was 26.5 billion rubles, while in 1940 it was only 8.6 billion rubles.

    失去劳动能力的人的生活越来越有保障
    俄罗斯联邦一千多万人享受优抚金
    新华社莫斯科26日电　自从苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议7月中通过国家优抚金法以来，到10月初为止，单是俄罗斯联邦共和国就有一千多万人享受到新定的标准较高的优抚金的好处。而从10月初到11月中，以前没有享受过优抚金的三十一万多人都领到了优抚金。
    俄罗斯联邦共和国社会赡养部长穆拉维耶娃11月24日在莫斯科对苏联和外国的新闻记者谈到了这个情况。
    穆拉维耶娃还说，1955年苏联居民获得的国家补助金总共为一千五百四十亿卢布，比1950年增加了三百二十亿卢布。在第五个五年计划中，国家用在这方面的费用为六千八百九十亿卢布。而在第六个五年计划中就要增加到约九千七百亿卢布。
    穆拉维耶娃说，随着社会主义国家的发展、社会劳动生产率的不断增长和国民收入的不断增加，苏联政府拨出越来越多的资金来保障失去劳动能力的人的生活。例如1955年的社会保险预算是二百六十五亿卢布，而1940年只有八十六亿卢布。
