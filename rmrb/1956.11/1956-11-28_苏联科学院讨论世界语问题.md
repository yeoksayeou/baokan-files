Soviet Academy of Sciences Discusses Esperanto Issues

    According to the "Scientific Life" column in the Soviet journal "Problems of Linguistics," No. 4, 1956 (July-August issue), the Soviet Academy of Sciences held a meeting earlier this year to discuss the Esperanto issue. This took place at a meeting of the General Linguistics and Comparative Historical Linguistics Group of the Academic Committee of the Institute of Linguistics. Bukalev, Deputy Director of the Institute of Linguistics and Doctor of Linguistic Sciences, first gave a report at the meeting entitled "On the Current Situation of the International Auxiliary Language Issue."

    The report pointed out that no scientific worker can absolutely only understand their native language in their research work. In the current situation, it is inevitable that they must master multiple foreign languages, and many documents must be translated into multiple languages. Therefore, scientists have long begun to experiment with international auxiliary language schemes to overcome this difficulty. In addition, due to the increasing development of international relations, not only the scientific community needs international auxiliary languages, but also the cultural, economic, and various other relations have such requirements. The report pointed out that it is not feasible to use an existing national language as an international auxiliary language. Attempts to promote English, or to promote "Basic English" revised based on English, have failed. The report also stated that some people once intended to use Latin as an international auxiliary language, but after World War II, schemes to reform Latin have received less and less attention.

    The report said: Another way to solve the international auxiliary language issue is to adopt an artificial language. The most famous and widely used in this regard is "Esperanto." Professor Bukalev briefly reviewed the seventy-year history since the publication of the first Esperanto book, pointed out the specific situation of the current Esperanto movement, and explained that Esperanto not only proved that artificial international auxiliary languages are theoretically possible, but also its existence and activities have practically proven this point.

    After his report, Bukalev also answered many questions from the attendees, such as why Esperanto was able to overcome many other international language schemes of the same era, and the role of Esperanto in safeguarding peace and strengthening mutual understanding among people of all countries, etc.

    Polkovsky, Director of the Institute of Linguistics and Doctor of Linguistic Sciences, and senior researchers from the Institute, including Maidinskaya, Tzilkov, Gornung, Reformatsky, Gukhman, and Leningrad University teacher Andreyev, all spoke at the meeting. The speakers unanimously affirmed Bukalev's report, pointed out the practical value of Esperanto, and pointed out that attention should be paid to the study of issues related to Esperanto. The speeches also mentioned that Esperanto is an easy-to-learn and expressive language. One speaker believed that the use of Esperanto should be separated from the issue of future international auxiliary languages, because Esperanto is only a product based on the Indo-European language family and has not yet considered various Asian languages. However, the attendees acknowledged that theoretical research should be conducted on Esperanto, and it should be studied from the perspective of the significance of collective language experiments.

    After discussing Bukalev's report, the meeting decided to listen to Bukalev's second report in the near future, namely, a report on Esperanto as a linguistic research object. The "Problems of Linguistics" magazine also decided to publish an essay on the issue of international auxiliary languages in its latest issue.

    苏联科学院讨论世界语问题
    据苏联“语言学问题”1956年第四期（7、8月号）“科学生活”栏报道，苏联科学院今年年初曾经开会讨论过世界语问题。这是在语言研究所学术委员会普通语言学和比较历史语言学组的会议上进行的。语言学研究所副所长、语言科学博士布卡略夫首先在会上作了“关于国际辅助语问题的现状”的报告。
    报告指出，任何一个科学工作者在他的研究工作中绝对不能只懂得本国语文。在目前情况下，他不可避免地要掌握多种外国语文，而且许多文献都必须互相翻译成多种文字，因此长久以来科学家们就开始试验一些国际辅助语的方案来克服这个困难。此外，由于国际关系的日益发展，不仅科学界需要国际辅助语，而且在文化、经济和各种关系上都有了这样的要求。报告指出，拿现存的一种民族语来作国际辅助语是行不通的。曾经有人企图推行英语，或者推行根据英语改订而成的“基本英语”，这些企图都失败了。报告又说，曾经有人打算利用拉丁语来做国际辅助语，但是在第二次世界大战后，改造拉丁语的方案也越来越少被人注意了。
    报告说：解决国际辅助语问题的另一条途径，就是采取人工性的语言。在这方面最著名的、而又应用最广的就是“世界语”（ESPERANTO）。布卡略夫教授简单地回顾了世界语第一本书出版以来七十年的历史，指出了目前世界语运动的具体情况，说明世界语不仅证明了人工性的国际辅助语在理论上是可能的，而且它的存在和活动在实践上也证明了这一点。
    布卡略夫在报告之后还回答了与会者的许多问题，例如世界语为什么能够战胜同时代的许多其他国际语方案，世界语在保卫和平加强各国人民相互之间的了解上所起的作用等等。
    语言研究所所长、语言科学博士波尔柯夫斯基，研究所的高级研究人员迈丁斯卡娅、齐尔柯夫、戈尔农、里福尔玛茨基、古赫曼，列宁格勒大学教师安德列耶夫在会上都发了言。发言者一致肯定了布卡略夫的报告，指出了世界语的实用价值，并且指出应当注意研究有关世界语的问题。发言中也谈到，世界语是一种容易学习、表现力也很强的语言。有一个发言者认为，应当把使用世界语与未来的国际辅助语这个问题分别开来，因为世界语只是以印欧语系为基础的产物，还没有考虑到亚洲各种语言。但是，与会者承认，应当对世界语进行理论研究，并且应当就集体的语言实验的意义上来加以研究。
    讨论了布卡略夫的报告后，会议决定在最近时期听取布卡略夫的第二个报告，即关于世界语作为语言学研究对象的报告。“语言学问题”杂志也决定在最近一期中发表关于国际辅助语问题的论文。
