What to Do When Some Commune Members' Incomes Decrease?
Shihchiachuang Special District's counties have analyzed various reasons why some commune members' incomes might decrease and have adopted various measures to help them increase their incomes.
    (By Our Correspondent) Shihchiachuang Special District's counties have adopted various methods to help agricultural cooperative members whose incomes may decrease to increase their incomes.
    This year, the counties in Shihchiachuang Special District suffered natural disasters of varying degrees, and the autumn's major crops mostly experienced reduced yields. By the end of October, over 95% of the district's 4,700+ agricultural cooperatives had formulated distribution plans. According to preliminary statistics from over 2,200 non-disaster and lightly affected cooperatives in eighteen counties, including Gaocheng, Jin County, Hengshui, and Zhengding, only over 500 cooperatives (approximately 27%) could ensure that more than 90% of their members' incomes increased, while other cooperatives could generally only guarantee income increases for 70% to 80% of their members; the incomes of members in disaster-stricken cooperatives were generally lower than last year. Therefore, during distribution, each county has made helping needy households whose incomes may decrease to increase their incomes one of its most important current tasks.
    Why would these members experience decreased incomes? According to analyses of situations in various locations, in addition to the impact of natural disasters, the common reasons include: some agricultural cooperatives deducted excessive public reserve funds, etc.; some focused solely on single-crop production in the first half of the year, neglecting diversified operations; some were joint-village cooperatives where economic foundations differed between villages, resulting in 100% income increases for members in poorer villages while most members in wealthier villages could not increase their incomes; some production teams had problematic original contracted work and output quotas, with some teams expending the same amount of labor as others but failing to achieve the original target output; and a few cooperatives suffered from inexperienced cooperative cadres who lacked proper management skills.
    Generally, there are several circumstances for members whose incomes decrease: wealthier households with more and better land experience significant income reductions after the cancellation of land dividends; households with fewer laborers and more dependents, who previously relied on land dividends, now have many people dependent on one person's income, and their income cannot increase, leading to difficulties in their lives; households with fruit tree income or special sideline income no longer have this income after joining the cooperative; households that incidentally lost labor power or cannot work as much due to illness or other reasons cannot keep up with their previous income; elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households who previously relied on relatives and friends for production cannot rely on others after joining the cooperative; and some village and cooperative cadres who lose work time due to public duties, although receiving subsidies, still have lower incomes than ordinary members.
    Various measures have been adopted in income distribution and sideline production to help these members whose incomes may decrease to increase their incomes. Gaocheng County's methods include: helping these households with reduced income to engage in sideline occupations; arranging more work opportunities for them, allowing them to contribute more labor; striving for early repayment of the price of the means of production that these needy households contributed upon joining the cooperative; organizing temporary mutual aid and borrowing; and allocating a portion of the public welfare fund to help them. The Maozhuang Township Agricultural Cooperative made arrangements for over 120 needy households with an average income of less than forty yuan per person, planning to organize them to participate in transportation, selling tofu, firing brick kilns, pushing carts, woodworking, and other productions, which could basically solve the problems of these needy households. Some cooperatives in Hengshui and other counties also formulated income-increasing plans for needy households whose incomes may decrease, on a household-by-household basis.
    During distribution, various locations, based on local conditions and the severity of disasters, compressed the proportion of retained public reserve funds as much as possible. It is understood that the preliminary distribution plans made by the cooperatives generally allocated too much to public reserve funds, welfare funds, and production funds, given this year's specific circumstances. According to information from twenty counties, ninety-seven cooperatives allocated over 40% of their total income to the cooperative. The Xing'an Cooperative in Gaocheng County initially set a distribution plan that allocated as much as 66% of the total income to the cooperative; each labor day averaged only three cents. The members were ideologically confused, and many said: "We worked hard all year, for nothing." After recalculating the accounts in detail, the cooperative only retained 35% of the total income, and the value of each labor day increased from three cents to nine cents, which raised the members' morale. Some cooperatives severely affected by disasters only deducted the most necessary production funds and other expenses, such as seeds, feed, and a small amount of public welfare funds.
    Various counties have researched appropriate solutions to the problems of unreasonable contracted work and output quotas in some cooperatives and the distribution problems in joint-village cooperatives. (Keli Lin)

    部分社员收入减少，怎么办？
    石家庄专区各县分析了一些社员收入可能减少的各种原因，采取各种措施帮助他们增加收入。
    本报讯　石家庄专区各县采取了种种办法帮助可能减少收入的农业社社员增加收入。
    石家庄专区各县今年遭受了程度不等的自然灾害，秋季主要农作物大部减产。到10月下旬，全区四千七百多个农业社，已经有95％作出了分配方案。据藁城、晋县、衡水、正定等十八个县的二千二百多个非灾和轻灾社的初步统计，只有五百多个社（约占27％）能做到90％以上的社员增加收入，其他社一般只能保证70％至80％的社员增加收入；受灾社社员收入一般都不及去年。因此，各县在分配中都把帮助可能减少收入的困难户增加收入，作为当前的重要工作之一。
    这些社员为什么会减少收入呢？据各地情况分析，除自然灾害的影响以外，一般的还有以下几种原因：有些是农业社扣除公积金等过多；有些是前半年生产单一化，放松了多种经营；有些是联村社，各村经济基础不同，贫村社员100％增加收入，而富村大部社员不能增加收入；有些是各生产队之间原定的包工包产方案有问题，有的队花费了和别的队同样的劳动却没达到原定的产量；还有少数社是因为社干部缺少经验，经营不善，管理不好。
    各地减少收入的社员，一般有这样几种情况：土地较多较好的富裕户，取消土地分红后收入显著减少；劳力少人口多的户，过去依靠一部分土地分红，现在许多人靠一人吃饭，而收入却不能增加，生活发生困难；有果树收入或有特殊副业收入的户，入社后这些收入没有了；偶然丧失劳力或因疾病等不能多出工的户收入赶不上过去；过去投亲投友进行生产的老弱孤寡户，加入社后，不能依靠别人了；还有些是村干部、社干部因公误工，虽有补贴，收入仍不及一般社员。
    各地在收益分配中和副业生产中采取了多种措施帮助这些可能减少收入的社员增加收入。藁城县采取的办法是：帮助这些减少收入的户搞副业；多给他们安排活路，让他们多出些工；对这些困难户入社的生产资料价款争取早还；组织临时的互助互借；从公益金中抽出一部分帮助他们。毛庄乡农业社在分配中对平均每人收入在四十元以下的一百二十多个困难户，分别进行了安排，打算组织他们参加运输、卖豆腐、烧砖窑、推小车、作木工等等生产，基本上可以解决这些困难户的问题。衡水等县有些社对可能减少收入的困难户，还按户作出了增加收入的方案。
    在分配中，各地根据当地情况和灾情轻重，尽可能地压缩留公积金等的比例。据了解，各社开始所作的预分方案，按照今年的具体情况来说，留公积金，公益金和生产资金的比例一般都偏大。据二十个县的了解，社里留的部分占总收入的40％以上的社有九十七个。藁城县兴安社初次定的分配方案，社里留下的竟达总收入的66％；每个劳动日平均才分到三角钱。社员思想混乱，不少人说：“一年忙到头，白干了。”经过重新细算账，社里只留下总收入的35％，每个劳动日的价值由三角提高到九角，社员情绪才高涨起来。有些灾情较重的社，只扣除最必需的生产资金和其他费用，如种籽、饲料和少量的公益金等。
    各县对一些社包工包产方案不合理的问题和联村社的分配问题，都研究出了适当的解决办法。　（克林）
