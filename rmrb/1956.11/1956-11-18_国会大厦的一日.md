A Day in the Parliament Building
By Our Correspondent Hu Shihsheng

　　The Budapest of November 3, 1956, was a city where white terror, like a host of demons, threatened every honest resident. The Parliament Building on Kossuth Square by the Danube was spending the last day of its dark days.

　　The eighteenth-century-style arched doors on the front of the building remained as before. In front of the arched doors stood the two sculpted lions familiar to the people of Budapest. On this day, four tanks served as their armed companions, and patrols of counterrevolutionary armed forces strode back and forth with resounding leather boots. Inside the building's long corridors, guards with submachine guns stood every few steps. Under such heavily guarded, siege-like protection, the government controlled by the counterrevolutionaries was entrenched here.

　　In the office of the Minister of State inside the building, one could see a man of short stature, around sixty years old, with white hair. This was the former Hungarian President Tildy. The man, who had suddenly become a minister, had not forgotten his accustomed gentlemanly airs. He held an American cigarette in his right hand, waiting for someone to light it for him, while discoursing in an unnatural voice: "I have not been involved in political activities for these past few years... The aim of our struggle is for independence and freedom. We demand the withdrawal of Soviet troops. We declare Hungary neutral, and we want to bring this issue to the United Nations..." His underlying meaning was very clear: to unite international reactionary forces to pull Hungary out of the socialist orbit.

　　On this day, one could see all kinds of figures in this building. From the main entrance, officers wearing uniforms from the Horthy era with beards appeared; there were those wearing jackets, top hats, who constantly said "Morning" (in English) when meeting people; and there were urban bandits who had just been released from prison by the counterrevolutionaries. In the corridors, one could see former landlords and major shareholders everywhere. These people crowded into the offices of various ministers, calling themselves Smallholders Party members (it is understood that these people had long been expelled from the Smallholders Party), demanding the return of the one hundred or two hundred holds of land that the people had confiscated from them for their collaboration with the Hitler fascists; some former factory owners and shareholders who claimed to belong to the Social Democratic Party proposed to abolish the decree nationalizing factories with more than one hundred or one hundred fifty workers. At this time, the major shareholder of the former Győr wool textile factory, who lived in Vienna, immediately telegraphed back, announcing that he would soon return to handle the takeover.

　　Officers of the Horthy era ran to the Parliament Building to arrest those they were dissatisfied with, and they even wanted to arrest Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, and Rónai, Chairman of the National Assembly, with revolvers. Similarly, reactionary officers in other areas also ignited the flames of white terror: some villages and towns set up counterrevolutionary military tribunals, sentencing the village and town Party secretaries to death; in Győr County, the so-called Arrow Cross Party was established, and the main task of this organization was to kill Communist Party members. Horthy, whose whereabouts had long been unknown, also appeared in Lisbon, Portugal. Seeing that the figures in the Parliament Building shared his common interests, this Hungarian fascist chieftain immediately expressed his willingness to return to serve...

　　However, the forces of the revolution could no longer tolerate it. On the morning of November 4, with the sound of artillery fire, the government entrenched in the Parliament Building, serving as a tool of the counterrevolutionaries, came to an end. Although Mindszenty cried "The national situation is serious, God bless" on the radio, the situation was no longer in the hands of the Mindszenty clique, but in the hands of the people.

    国会大厦的一日
    本报记者　胡思升
    1956年11月3日的布达佩斯，白色恐怖像一群魔鬼，威胁着全城每一个正直的居民。多瑙河边科苏特广场上的国会大厦，在度过它黑色日子的最后一天。
    大厦正面，十八世纪风格的拱形门依然如旧。拱形门的前面，站着布达佩斯人熟悉的两头雕塑成的狮子，就在这一天，四辆坦克做着它的武装伴侣，反革命武装的巡逻兵跨着响亮的皮靴来回走动。大厦里边的长廊，每隔几步就有一个端着冲锋枪的卫兵。在如此警卫森严、如临大敌的保护下，掌握在反革命手里的政府就盘踞在这里。
    在大厦内的国务部长办公室内，可以看到一个身材不高、六十岁上下年纪、白色头发的人，这就是前匈牙利总统蒂尔迪。这个一跃而为部长的人还没有忘记对他十分习惯的绅士派头，右手拿着美国烟，一面等待人家给他点火，一面用不自然的声音在高谈阔论：“我这几年来一直不参加政治活动……我们这次斗争的目的是为了独立和自由。我们要求苏军撤出。我们宣布匈牙利中立，要把这个问题提到联合国。……”他的言下之意是很清楚的，纠合国际反动力量把匈牙利从社会主义的轨道上拉出来。
    这天，在这座大厦里，可以看到各式各样的人物。从大门那边，出现了穿着霍尔蒂时代军服的留胡子的军官；有身穿夹克、头带礼帽、见人时口中不时“冒宁”（英文早安）的人；有刚从监狱里被反革命放出来的城市匪徒。在走廊里到处可以看见以前的大地主和大股东们。这些人挤进各部部长的办公室，自称为小农党人（据了解这些人早就被小农党开除了），要求把当年人民由于他们和希特勒法西斯合作而被没收的一百或二百霍尔德土地“物归原主”；一些自称属于社会民主党的前工厂主和股东们提议取消拥有一百或一百五十个工人以上的工厂国有化的法令。就在这个时候，住在维也纳的前吉厄尔州毛纺织厂的大股东马上拍电报回来，宣布他不久将回来办理接收工作。
    霍尔蒂时代的军官跑到国会大厦逮捕他们不满意的人，他们甚至拿着转盘枪要逮捕匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比和国民议会主席罗奈伊。同样，外地的反动军官也燃起了白色恐怖的火焰：有的村镇设立了反革命的军事刑庭，判处村镇党的书记以死刑；在吉厄尔州成立了所谓箭十字党，这个组织的主要任务是杀害共产党员。长久以来人们不知其生死的霍尔蒂也在葡萄牙里斯本出现了。这个匈牙利法西斯头子看见国会大厦里的人物同他有着共同的志趣，马上表示愿回来效劳……。
    但是，革命的力量已经不能忍耐了。11月4日清晨一声炮响，盘踞在国会大厦里的充当反革命工具的政府就此寿终正寝。明曾蒂虽然在电台呼叫“国情严重，上帝保佑”，但形势已经不属于明曾蒂之流，而是掌握在人民的手中了。
