Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The film "The Great Sun Yat-sen" was completed today by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio. The film will be released on November 12th, the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth.

This is a documentary film. It records Mr. Sun Yat-sen's brilliant achievements in his lifelong commitment to the democratic revolution.

The film begins at the Sun Yat-sen's former residence in Cuiheng Village, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, where Mr. Sun Yat-sen spent his childhood. Then, it introduces Mr. Sun Yat-sen's early years abroad, uniting revolutionary patriots, organizing the "Revive China Society" and the "Tongmenghui" successively, leading the democratic revolution unyieldingly, and organizing many armed uprisings, paying significant sacrifices, and finally launching the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, establishing the Republic of China, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen being elected as the Provisional President.

The film shot Mr. Sun Yat-sen's former residence in Shanghai. After Mr. Sun Yat-sen was forced by imperialism and its running dog Yuan Shikai to resign as Provisional President in 1912, he began to contact the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Union in this former residence, and completed immortal works such as "The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction," "Sun Wen's Doctrine," and "The Industrial Plan."

The film uses many precious documents and photos to illustrate the important development of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in politics and thought in his later years, especially the profound influence of the great October Socialist Revolution of 1917 on him.

The film introduces Mr. Sun Yat-sen's acceptance of the Chinese Communist Party's proposal to establish the "Alliance with Russia, Alliance with the Communist Party, and Assistance to Farmers and Workers" policy, reorganize the Kuomintang, and publish the famous "Manifesto of the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang," which made a new interpretation of the Three Principles of the People. From the film, you can see the words written by Mr. Sun Yat-sen himself, "In the future, the revolution will not succeed without taking Russia as its teacher."

Unforgettable historical scenes are left on the screen. Among them are the scenes of Mr. Sun Yat-sen delivering a speech to the soldiers at the oath-taking rally of the Northern Expedition Army held in Shaoguan, Guangdong Province more than 30 years ago, and the scene of marching north; there is also the true scene of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death in Beijing, and his coffin being transported from Beijing to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing. The film also shot the situation of people forever remembering Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and famous people at home and abroad paying respect to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Sun Yat-sen's former residence.

The film finally records that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great patriotic ideals were finally realized in 1949 under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

    影片——“伟大的孙中山”摄制完成即将上映
    新华社9日讯　影片“伟大的孙中山”今天由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄制完成。影片将在孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念日——11月12日上映。
    这是一部文献影片。它纪录了中山先生毕生从事民主革命的光辉业迹。
    影片从中山先生度过童年的地方——广东省中山县翠亨村中山故居开始。接着，介绍中山先生早年在国外团结革命志士，先后组织“兴中会”、“同盟会”，不屈不挠地领导民主革命，以及多次组织武装起义，付出重大的牺牲，终于在1911年举行辛亥革命，成立中华民国，中山先生被举为临时大总统等情况。
    影片拍摄了中山先生的上海故居。中山先生在1912年受帝国主义及其走狗袁世凯的逼迫辞去临时大总统后，在这所故居里开始和中国共产党、和苏联进行了接触，并完成了“民权初步”、“孙文学说”、“实业计划”等不朽著作。
    影片通过许多珍贵的文献、照片，说明中山先生晚年在政治上和思想上的重要发展，特别是1917年伟大的十月社会主义革命给他的深刻影响。
    影片介绍了中山先生接受中国共产党的建议，确定“联俄、联共、扶助农工”的三大政策，改组国民党，并发表有名的“中国国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言”，对三民主义作了新的解释等情况。从影片上，可以看到中山先生亲笔写的“今后之革命非以俄为师断无成就”等字样。
    银幕上留下了永恒难忘的历史镜头。其中有三十多年前中山先生在广东省韶关举行的北伐军誓师大会上向士兵发表演说和北上的情景；还有中山先生在北京逝世，灵柩由北京运往南京中山陵的真实情景。影片还拍摄了人们永远追念中山先生，国内外著名人士瞻仰中山陵、中山故居的情况。
    影片最后纪录了孙中山先生伟大的爱国理想，终于在1949年，在中国共产党领导下实现的情形。
