Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: The "Soviet Film Week," which began in twenty cities across the country in early November, has mostly concluded.

The Film Week was an unprecedented success. In the first group of cities to hold the Film Week—Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Urumqi—there were over 2.7 million viewers. In Shanghai, the city's twenty-three cinemas screened 591 showings. In Shenyang alone, there were over 710,000 viewers. In Dalian-Lushun, eleven cinemas universally added screenings, with some cinemas showing seven consecutive screenings in a single day. Many viewers in the rural suburbs of Hangzhou also travelled to the city to see the film "The Reluctant Son-in-Law," which was screened as part of the Film Week. This film reflects the conflict between advanced and backward thinking in Soviet collective farms.

Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: The Soviet film workers delegation, which was invited to China to participate in the "Soviet Film Week" activities, returned home by plane from Beijing today.

The delegation arrived in Beijing on November 5th. They met with over 25,000 audience members in Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and other places, and established a deep friendship with people in the Chinese film industry.

The head of the delegation, Kalashnikov, will remain in Beijing temporarily due to other matters. Member Maretskaya already returned to Moscow on the 18th.
