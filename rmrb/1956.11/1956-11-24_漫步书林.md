    On Printing Books

    Ancient books are often passed down as unique copies, making widespread circulation difficult. Some are original manuscripts, making them the only one of their kind in the world. When the quantity is small but the number of people who want to read them is large, then re-"printing" is the only way to go. Just printing a hundred or a thousand copies is already a transformation into a hundred or a thousand, able to supply hundreds or thousands of people, or even more. Some old newspapers are extremely precious "unique copies." Because too many people are looking for materials, the words have been worn away from repeated reading, and the paper has become fragile. They have reached the point where they can no longer be read, yet people are still reading them. Why not hurry up and re-"print" several copies? Some old magazines, starting from the first issue, are already nearly decades or a century old. Complete sets are no longer available, especially foreign language and specialized magazines. Then, reprinting five or six hundred or even a thousand copies is completely necessary. This can really be regarded as directly serving scientific research.

    However, the method of reprinting those foreign language, complete sets of old magazines is greatly worth considering. Mr. Xiang Da, director of the Peking University Library, complained to me that he has a complete set of foreign language mathematics magazines, etc., and those who reprint them borrow them from him. How can he not lend them out? But when they are returned after printing, the original books are already so fragile that they can no longer be read. It turns out that they used the "Longmen" style of photographic reproduction, disassembling the original books and printing them page by page directly on the plate. This method can be described as extremely reckless and destructive. It may be possible to do this for the reprinting of newly published books, because the original books are not difficult to obtain, and it will not hurt too much to ruin one or two copies. To treat the precious collections of libraries with such a method is really only considering the present and not the future. How can we be worthy of the valuable property of the country! Why not spend more effort and more money to use photolithography or offset printing methods? The original book will not be damaged, the layout will be exceptionally clear, and the money that subscribers have to spend will not increase too much. Why not do it? This kind of rough attitude and method of treating the country's valuable books cannot be allowed to continue.

    Speaking of photographic reproduction, shouldn't the attitude towards the original ancient books be more cautious and more attentive to protecting the original books? Generally speaking, the basic idea of cherishing the original ancient books has been established, but some publishers still have a rough attitude. The original book is disassembled for photography. When it is restored, the style has changed somewhat. Some are bound so poorly that they are completely messed up. I had a copy of the illustrations of Water Margin, which was borrowed by a publishing house for photographic plate making. When it was returned to me several months later, many pages were covered with white paper, with a lot of instructions written on them. If I tear them off, the pages of the original book will break along with them, so I have to let it be covered in scraps of paper. How can this not be infuriating!

    However, even though some re-"printing" methods are not right, re-"printing" is still a good thing, and it is a necessary thing.

    There are many ways to print books. Here, I will only talk about the reprinting of ancient books. According to the methods of re-"printing" ancient books, there are those that are photographically reproduced from the original books, those that are typeset with lead characters, those that are punctuated, and even those that are given new annotations.

    In the past, people always loved to print the Classics, Histories, Philosophers, and Collections together, the so-called "Four Series Congkan," "Four Series Beiyao," etc., which were very popular, just in time to match the so-called "National Studies Must-Read Book List," which was popular in the world. It was very boring, just allowing the living rooms of the rich to have a set of novel furnishings. Among them, "Four Series Congkan" used good editions and photographically reproduced them, while "Four Series Beiyao" used common editions and typeset them. Some of the books in "Four Series Beiyao" that were typeset according to "ancient editions" were actually stolen from "Four Series Congkan," like Tang Meng Haoran's collection, which is one piece of evidence. There was also the "National Studies Basic Series," which was punctuated, and the "Student National Studies Series," which was a new selection and given new annotations. They all used the big signboard of "National Studies" or "Four Series" to encompass a lot of things. But all those things are far from enough for experts to use, but they are too difficult for beginners to use. At the same time, there are too many useless things. It is better to have the "Four Books and Five Classics," "Collection of Philosophers," "Selections of Refined Literature," etc., published by the World Bookstore in the past, which were very useful, cheap, and easy to use. The "Supplement to the Twenty-Five Histories" published by the Kaiming Bookstore was for experts to use.

    Now, if we re-"print" ancient books, we should take the strengths of the past and discard the weaknesses. In other words, all-encompassing things should no longer exist, unless it is stated that they are specifically for medium and small libraries. In fact, even medium and small libraries will not welcome that kind of "Four Series" and "National Studies." How much of it is "waste"! But more specialized things are necessary, and they are needed by both experts and beginners.

    谈印书
    古书常是孤本传世，难于广泛地流通。有些是原稿本，那末，更是天壤间只此一帙了。数量少而欲读之者多，那末，势非出于重“印”之一途不可。仅仅只印它百部、千部吧，已经是化身为百，为千，能够供给千百个人或更多的人使用的了。有些旧报纸，极为珍贵的“孤本”，为了找材料的人太多，已经被翻阅得字迹都磨消了，纸张都松脆了，已经到了不可再阅的地步，然而还有人在翻阅。为什么不赶紧地重“印”它若干份呢？有些旧杂志，从第一号起，已经将近几十年或百年了，全份的不可再得，特别是外文的、专门性的杂志，那末，翻印个五六百份乃至千份，也是完全必要的。这实在可算是直接地为科学研究服务了。
    但那些外文的整套的旧杂志的翻印方法，却大大地值得考虑。北京大学图书馆主任向达先生向我诉苦，他那里藏有外文的全套数学杂志等等，翻印者们向他借出重印。怎能不借给他们呢？等到印毕归还，原书已经松脆得不能再读了。原来是用了“龙门”式的影印方法，将原书拆散了，一页页地直接上版印出的。这个方法，可谓鲁莽灭裂之极，对于新出版的书的重印，或者可以如此做，因为原书还不难得，糟蹋一部、两部的，还不会怎么心痛。对于宝贵的图书馆的珍藏品，也用如此的方法处理之，实在未免只顾眼前，不问后果了。如何对得住国家的宝贵财产呢！为什么不多花些功夫，多用些费用，改用石版或胶版的照相影印的方法呢？原书既可不受损伤，版面也格外显得清晰，预约者所要花的钱也并不会增得太多的。何乐而不为呢？这样地粗暴地对待国家所有的珍贵的图书的态度和办法是不能再容许继续下去的了。
    说起照相影印来，对待原本古书的态度岂是更谨慎、更仔细注意于保护原书些？一般说来，爱护原本古书的基本思想是建立起来了，但有的出版社态度还不免粗暴。原书是被拆散了照相的，等到还原时，式样就有些更变了。有的装订得四不像，十分地狼狈。我有一册水浒传的插图，被一个出版社借去照相制版。等到若干月之后还给我时，许多页上都贴满了白纸，写了不少说明，要一撕下，原书的页子，就会随之而破裂了，只好随它那样满身披挂了碎纸条下去。怎不令人气愤呢！
    不过尽管有些重“印”的办法不对头，重“印”还是一件好事，而且是一件必要的事。
    印书的办法多矣。这里只谈谈古书的重印。按重“印”古书的办法，有照原书影印的，有用铅字排印的，有加以标点的，更有加以新的注解的。
    在过去，总爱经史子集一道印，所谓“四部丛刊”，“四部备要”之类，流行甚广，恰好配合所谓“国学必读书目”之类的风行于世，大是无聊，只不过让有钱人的客厅里有一套新颖的陈设而已。在其间，“四部丛刊”是采用善本，加以影印的，“四部备要”则是采取通行本，加以排印的。“四部备要”里的若干照“古本”排印的书，其实只是窃之于“四部丛刊”的，像唐孟浩然集，就是一个证据。还有“国学基本丛书”则是加以标点的，“学生国学丛书”则是新的选本，并加以新的注解的。他们都是用“国学”或“四部”的大招牌，包罗了不少东西。但所有那些东西，给专家们使用是万万不够的，给初学者们使用却又嫌其太艰深，同时，没有用的东西也太多。还不如像从前世界书店出版的“四书五经”、“诸子集成”、“文选”等，反而大有用处，廉价而使用方便。开明书店出版的“二十五史补编”则是供给专家们使用的。
    现在如果重“印”古书，应该取过去之所长，而弃去其所短，换一句话，就是说，包罗万有的东西不应该再有了，除非说明是专门供给中、小型图书馆用的。其实，连中、小型的图书馆，对于那一类的“四部”、“国学”也是不会欢迎的。其中有多少是“废物”！但比较专门化的东西却是必要的，且无论对于专家们或初学者们都是需要的。
