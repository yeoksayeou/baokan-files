Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 19th: The Indian government said in a statement issued on November 18th that India believes the UN Emergency Force sent to Egypt should have no connection with the operation or management of the Suez Canal. The statement said that the Indian government agreed to the UN Secretary-General's request to send troops only to help restore peace in West Asia.

The statement said that India had indicated that the stationing of international forces in Egypt should in no way be regarded as a continuation of the Anglo-French military occupation of the Suez region, and had emphasized that the force should only be stationed there temporarily. It also stated that the terms under which the force operates must be fully acceptable to Egypt.

The statement said that the first batch of troops provided by India had arrived in Naples, Italy, en route to Egypt, and the second batch was scheduled to fly to Egypt on November 21.

    印度重申联合国部队只能暂驻埃及
    并应同苏伊士运河的经营管理毫无关系
    新华社新德里19日电　印度政府在11月18日发表的一篇声明说，印度认为，派遣到埃及去的联合国紧急部队应当同苏伊士运河的经营或管理毫无关系。声明说，印度政府所以同意了联合国秘书长要它派遣军队的请求，只是为了帮助恢复西亚的和平。
    声明说，印度曾经表明，国际部队驻扎在埃及决不应该被认为是英法对苏伊士区的军事占领的延续，并且曾强调指出，这支部队只能暂时驻扎在那里。它还曾经表明，这支部队的行动所依据的条件必须是埃及完全可以接受的。
    声明说，印度提供的第一批部队已经在前往埃及途中到达意大利那不勒斯，第二批预定在11月21日乘飞机前往埃及。
