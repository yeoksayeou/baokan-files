Xinhua News Agency, London, November 1st. The British Labour Party proposed on October 31st a motion of impeachment strongly condemning the government's war policy towards Egypt. This proposal will be discussed in the House of Commons on November 1st.

Hugh Gaitskell warned the government in the House of Commons on October 31st: "I must tell the government and the country that we cannot support the actions they have taken, and we feel we must use every constitutional means at our disposal to oppose this action."

Gaitskell believes that the government's decision is a "very foolish action, and we will regret the unfortunate consequences of this action for many years."

He said: "British armed intervention is clearly a violation of the United Nations Charter."

He doubted whether Britain and France would get a supporter in the United Nations General Assembly. He said: "The whole world believes that this is clearly a pretext to seize the Suez Canal."

Labour MP Arthur Henderson said: The government is already waging war. He believes that this war is morally and legally wrong. He condemned the government for undermining the solemn guarantees it made when signing the charter.

Labour MP Desmond Donnelly also warned the government that demonstrations will be held throughout Britain in the coming weeks. He said: "We will do everything we can to try to salvage the situation in the interests of the country. We believe that the only way to achieve this goal is to replace the government."

Prime Minister Eden refused to provide Parliament with any information on the movements of British and French ground forces. He only repeated his statement on October 30th that British and French forces would intervene with the necessary force. He emphasized: "We stand by what we have said, and we will do what we say." He added that if Egypt does not respond quickly, the British and French troops will have no choice but to enter the Suez Canal area.

Shouts demanding the government "resign" erupted in Parliament.

Eden moved that the House of Commons agree to the actions taken by the government. He asked the House of Commons to hold a vote of confidence on this motion on November 1st.

British Foreign Secretary Lloyd announced that the British and French air forces have begun bombing Egypt. He said, "It is completely untrue that Cairo was bombed." However, he added that he could not provide details of the air strikes because "the bombing is still in progress."

House of Commons Leader Butler announced that the House of Commons session, originally scheduled to end on November 1st, has been extended to 5:00 PM Greenwich Mean Time on November 5th due to the international situation.

    英国议会中爆发出撤换政府的喊声
    工党对艾登政府提出弹劾案
    据新华社伦敦1日电　英国工党10月31日提出了一项强烈谴责政府对埃及的战争政策的弹劾案。这个提案将在10月1日在下院讨论。
    盖次克尔10月31日在下院警告政府说：“我必须告诉政府和全国，我们不能支持他们所采取的行动，并且我们觉得必须利用我们所能用的一切宪法手段来反对这一行动。”
    盖次克尔认为，政府的决定是“非常愚笨的行动，我们将要为这个行动的不幸后果遗憾多年”。
    他说：“英国的武装干涉显然是违反联合国宪章的。”
    他怀疑英法在联合国大会中是否会得到一个支持者。他说：“全世界都认为这显然是想夺取苏伊士运河的托辞。”
    工党议员阿瑟·汉德逊说：政府已经在进行战争。他认为，这种战争在道义上和法律上都是错误的。他谴责政府破坏了它在签署宪章时所作的庄严保证。
    工党议员德斯蒙德·唐纳利也警告政府说，在今后几个星期内，英国各地将举行示威。他说：“我们将尽我们力之所能设法按照国家的利益来挽救局势。我们认为，能够达到这样的目的的唯一方法是撤换政府。”
    艾登首相拒绝向议会提供英法地面部队移动的任何消息。他只重复他10月30日发表的关于英法部队将以必要的力量进行干涉的声明，他着重指出：“我们坚持我们已经说过的话，我们将说到做到。”他又说，如果埃及不迅速答复，英法两国军队除了开入苏伊士运河区以外，没有别的办法。
    议会中爆发了要求政府“辞职”的喊声。
    艾登提出动议，要下院同意政府所采取的行动。他要求下院在11月1日就这个动议举行信任投票。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德宣布，英法空军已经开始对埃及进行轰炸。他说，“开罗受到轰炸是完全不真实的”。但是，他又说，他不能奉告空袭详情，因为“轰炸仍在进行中”。
    下院领袖巴特勒宣布，原定11月1日结束的议会下院会议因为国际局势关系，延长到11月5日格林威治时间十七点再行结束。
