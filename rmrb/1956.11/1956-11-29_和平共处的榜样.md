    A Model of Peaceful Coexistence
    Premier Zhou Enlai has concluded his friendly visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia and issued a joint statement with Prime Minister San Yun. The moving and far-reaching friendly exchanges between China and Cambodia are not only a brilliant development of the long-standing friendship between the two peoples, but also a good example of sincere implementation of peaceful coexistence between countries.
      Since the resumption of contact at the Geneva Conference and the Bandung Conference, the friendship between China and Cambodia has been growing. In February of this year, the joint statement issued by Prince Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai during the Prince's visit to China laid the foundation for peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between the two countries. Since then, the two governments have signed trade agreements and economic assistance agreements, established economic delegations to each other, and increased trade and economic cooperation between the two countries. During Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long's visit to Cambodia, they were warmly and cordially received by the King and Queen of Cambodia, Prince Sihanouk, and Cambodian government leaders, and were enthusiastically welcomed by the people of Phnom Penh and other parts of Cambodia. These vivid facts demonstrate the depth of the foundation of friendship between the two peoples, and also demonstrate the great vitality of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in promoting peace and friendship.
    In the joint statement, the two governments reaffirmed their confidence in the Five Principles, and both sides agreed that the policies adopted in accordance with the Five Principles are not only conducive to the prosperity of the two peoples, but also conducive to maintaining peace in Asia and the world. The two countries are determined to thoroughly implement the Five Principles so that such relations become a model of international cooperation and understanding between peoples, and contribute to peace in Asia and the world. This confidence and determination of the two governments reflects the greatest interests of the two peoples and will be supported by the two peoples.
    As a concrete measure to implement the Five Principles and enhance the friendship between the two peoples, the joint statement expressed the desire to maintain and develop relations between the two countries, especially economic relations. This is also the common wish of the people of China and Cambodia. The Chinese people have suffered from colonial aggression for a long time, and are now doing their best to carry out national construction in order to change China's backwardness. Therefore, we need a lasting peaceful international environment. We have the deepest brotherly feelings for many Asian countries in situations similar to ours, because the consolidation and development of independent Asian countries are the most important factors in maintaining peace in Asia and the world. Prince Sihanouk and the Royal Government of Cambodia adhere to a policy of peace and neutrality, bravely defend Cambodia's independence despite the threats of certain international forces, and strive to promote international peace and national construction, winning the sympathy and admiration of all peace-loving countries and people. The Chinese people sincerely hope to promote economic development with each other through equal and mutually beneficial trade relations and economic cooperation relations between China and Cambodia.
    In the joint communique, the two governments expressed satisfaction with the fact that Chinese nationals in Cambodia have always lived in friendship and harmony with the Cambodian people. Premier Zhou Enlai also urged the overseas Chinese in Cambodia to strive to promote friendly relations between China and Cambodia. This is a concrete manifestation of the two governments strengthening Sino-Cambodian friendship in all aspects, and it will surely be supported by the people of the two countries, especially the overseas Chinese in Cambodia who love their motherland and value Sino-Cambodian friendship.
    The Chinese people are deeply convinced that Premier Zhou Enlai's friendly visit to Cambodia and the warm reception of our government leaders by the entire country of Cambodia have greatly deepened the mutual understanding between the two peoples, and the bridge of friendship between the two countries is even more solid; the friendly and cooperative relations between the people of China and Cambodia will surely achieve further development on this basis.

    和平共处的榜样
    周恩来总理已经结束了在柬埔寨王国的友好访问，并和桑云首相发表了联合声明。中柬两国之间的令人感动的和影响深远的友好交往，不但是两国人民悠久友谊的光辉发展，而且将成为各国之间忠诚地实现和平共处的良好榜样。
      自从在日内瓦会议和万隆会议上恢复接触以来，中柬两国之间的友谊是与日俱增地发展的。今年2月，西哈努克亲王在访问我国期间同周恩来总理发表的联合声明，奠定了两国之间和平共处和友好合作关系的基础。在此以后，两国政府更签订了贸易协定和经济援助协定，互设了经济代表团，增进了两国之间的贸易来往和经济合作关系。这次，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在柬埔寨访问期间，受到了柬埔寨国王和王后、西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨政府领导人十分隆重的亲切的接待，受到了金边市和柬埔寨各地广大人民极为热烈的欢迎。这些生动的事实，说明了两国人民友谊基础的深厚，也说明了和平共处五项原则对于促进和平友好所具有的巨大生命力。
    两国政府在联合声明中重申了对于五项原则的信心，双方一致认为依照五项原则所采取的政策不仅有利于两国人民的繁荣，而且有利于维护亚洲和世界的和平。两国决心彻底实现五项原则，以便使这样的关系成为国际合作和各国人民之间谅解的榜样，并对亚洲和世界的和平作出贡献。两国政府的这种信心和决心，反映了两国人民的最大利益，必将得到两国人民的拥护。
    作为实现五项原则和增进两国人民的友谊的具体措施之一，联合声明表示了要保持和发展两国之间的关系、特别是经济关系的愿望。这也是中柬两国人民的共同愿望。我国人民曾经长期遭受殖民主义侵略的祸害，现在正以全力进行国家建设，以便改变我国的落后状态。因此，我们需要一个持久的和平的国际环境。我们对于处境和我们相似的许多亚洲国家，怀有最深切的兄弟般的感情，因为取得独立的亚洲各国的巩固和发展，乃是维护亚洲和世界和平最重要的因素。西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨王国政府坚持奉行和平中立政策，不顾某些国际势力的威胁英勇地捍卫柬埔寨的独立，并且努力促进国际和平和国家建设，赢得了所有爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和钦敬。中国人民衷心地期望通过中柬两国之间的平等互利的贸易关系和经济合作关系，来互相促进经济的发展。
    在联合公报中，两国政府对于我国侨民同柬埔寨人民一向友好地和正确地相处的事实表示满意，周恩来总理并叮嘱旅柬华侨为促进中柬两国的友好关系而努力。这是两国政府从各个方面来加强中柬友谊的具体表现，它必将得到两国人民、特别是热爱祖国和重视中柬友谊的旅柬华侨的拥护。
    中国人民深信，周恩来总理这次在柬埔寨的友好访问和柬埔寨全国上下对我国政府领导人的盛情接待，已经使得两国人民之间的相互了解大大地加深了，两国之间的友谊的桥梁更加坚实了；中柬两国人民之间的友好合作关系，必将在这个基础上获得更进一步的发展。
