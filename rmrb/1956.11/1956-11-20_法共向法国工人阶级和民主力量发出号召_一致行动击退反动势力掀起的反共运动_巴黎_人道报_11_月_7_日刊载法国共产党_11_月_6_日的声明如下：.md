    The following is the statement of the French Communist Party on November 6, published in the Paris "Humanité" on November 7:
    United action to deal with reactionaries and Fascism.
    The recent provocations and attacks by fascist shock troops in Paris against the "Humanité" office, the location of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and similar attacks against the locations of several democratic groups in other provinces, reveal the full significance of the anti-communist, anti-Soviet hysteria against the French working class and the people.
    These atrocities demonstrate the annoyance of the reactionaries and fascists after the failure of the counter-revolution in Hungary, a failure due to the actions of the Hungarian people and the actions of the Soviet army at the request of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Government.
    The massacre and torture of the finest sons of the Hungarian working class, reminiscent of the practices of the Nazi Gestapo, the destruction of historical sites, and the smashing of the Hungarian Working People's Party headquarters—all these lawless acts hailed by the reactionaries have nothing in common with freedom and are merely the hallmarks of Fascism.
    Cardinal Mindszenty, former landlord and oppressor of Hungarian peasants Prince Esterházy, and the bloody dictator Horthy have expressed their support for the Hungarian counter-revolutionary movement, with the same attitude as the French fascists....
    It is increasingly clear that the Hungarian counter-revolutionary movement, instigated by foreign imperialism, aims not only to restore the old capitalist and feudal systems in Hungary, but also to drive a wedge within the socialist camp, thereby allowing the war-makers to approach the Soviet border and turn Hungary into an aggression base that could be used to launch a third world war.
    From the Hungarian counter-revolutionary movement that seeks to eliminate the freedom of the Hungarian people, to the reactionaries and fascists in France who cheer the aggression against Egypt, is a connected chain.
    The fascists, with repeated provocative demonstrations, arrogantly claiming to control the streets, and clearly seeking to create the atmosphere of February 6 (1934), can only arouse a strong counterattack from the French working class and the people.
    The fascists of the likes of Tixier-Vignancour and Dides, the gang that once colluded with Pétain and Hitler, are portraying Horthy's supporters as defenders of the people's freedom. Franco and the Vatican are fully supporting the Hungarian counter-revolutionary movement. Faced with these facts, Communists and Socialists, all laborers and democrats who love freedom and peace, should fulfill their responsibilities.
    The current government, allowing the fascists to do whatever they want, obeyed the reactionaries and banned the November 7 meeting at the Winter Velodrome, once again backing the reactionaries' disruptive activities.
    Socialist laborers, you must be uneasy about seeing your leaders pursuing reactionary policies while colluding with the fascists' disruptive activities.
    Like in 1934 when we fought back against Fascism, together with your Communist brothers, you will fight to thwart fascist provocations and attacks, to block the path of reactionaries and enemies of freedom and peace.
    The current task for the working class and democratic forces, more urgent than ever, is to unite in action to defend freedom and peace.
    Now more than ever, it is imperative to be vigilant in factories, neighborhoods, and villages so that all attempts by reactionaries and fascists cannot succeed.
    As long as we work together with one heart and one mind, we can save the threatened freedom and the world peace facing crisis.
                                French Communist Party

    法共向法国工人阶级和民主力量发出号召
    一致行动击退反动势力掀起的反共运动
    巴黎“人道报”11月7日刊载法国共产党11月6日的声明如下：
    一致行动对付反动派和法西斯主义。
    法西斯突击队最近在巴黎对“人道报”社址、法国共产党中央委员会所在地的挑衅和袭击，以及对外省若干民主团体所在地的类似的袭击，揭露了针对法国工人阶级和人民的反共、反苏歇斯底里运动的全部意义。
    这种暴行表明反动派和法西斯分子看到反革命在匈牙利失败之后的恼怒，而反革命的失败是由于匈牙利人民采取行动和苏军在匈牙利工农政府要求下行动的结果。
    对匈牙利工人阶级最优秀的儿子的屠杀和施加酷刑，使人记忆起纳粹秘密国家警察的作法，破坏名胜古迹、捣毁匈牙利劳动人民党总部，所有这些受到反动派欢呼的横行不法举动都同自由毫无共同之处，只是法西斯主义的标志。
    明曾蒂大主教、前大地主匈牙利农民压迫者埃斯特哈齐亲王、血腥独裁者霍尔蒂表明态度支持匈牙利反革命运动，同法国法西斯分子的态度是同一性质的……。
    日益明显，受到外国帝国主义鼓动的匈牙利反革命运动，其目的不仅仅在于在匈牙利恢复旧资本主义和封建主义制度，还要在社会主义阵营内部打入一个楔子，从而使战争制造者逼近苏联边境并使匈牙利变成可能用来发动第三次世界大战的一个侵略基地。
    从力求消灭匈牙利人民的自由的匈牙利反革命运动，到在法国欢呼侵略埃及的反动和法西斯分子，是连接起来的一条链子。
    一再挑衅示威、狂妄到说要控制住街道、显然力求制造（1934年）2月6日气氛的法西斯分子，只能引起法国工人阶级和人民的有力反击。
    蒂克西埃—维尼扬古尔和迪德之流的法西斯分子、曾经同贝当和希特勒勾结的那伙人，把霍尔蒂的拥护者说成是人民自由的保卫者，佛朗哥和梵蒂冈则全力支持匈牙利反革命运动，在这些事实面前，共产党人和社会党人，热爱自由与和平事业的一切劳动者、民主主义者应该尽到他们的责任。
    让法西斯分子为所欲为的现政府听命于反动派而禁止了11月7日冬季赛车场的集会，从而再一次替反动派的捣乱活动作后盾。
    社会党劳动者，看到你们的领导人奉行反动政策同时又和法西斯分子的捣乱活动勾结起来，你们一定不免要为此感到不安。
    像在1934年反击法西斯主义一样，同你们的共产党弟兄在一起，你们将为挫败法西斯挑衅和袭击而斗争，来堵塞反动派以及自由与和平的敌人的道路。
    工人阶级和民主力量比任何时候更加迫切的当前任务是团结一致采取行动来保卫自由与和平。
    现在比任何时候更加迫切需要在工厂、住区和乡村中提高警惕，以使反动派和法西斯的一切尝试不能得逞。
    只要我们协力同心一致行动，我们就能拯救受到威胁的自由和面临危机的世界和平。
                                法国共产党
                                1956年11月6日
