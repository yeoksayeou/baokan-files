    Hengyang Prefectural Committee Issues Circular Urging No Discrimination Against Individual Farmers
    (Our Dispatch) The CPC Hengyang Prefectural Committee in Hunan Province is taking measures to correct the phenomenon of discrimination and harsh treatment of individual farmers that has occurred in various localities since the establishment of advanced cooperatives.
    In Hengyang region, after the basic completion of advanced agricultural cooperativization in early October this year, there are still 5.1% of farmers working individually. Many agricultural cooperatives have adopted erroneous practices such as sarcasm, harsh treatment, and exclusion towards these individual farmers. In Changling Township, Changning, the Lianmeng Cooperative, in order to facilitate operations, forcibly transferred the three mu of large fields in front of Guo Huaide's house, an individual farmer, to the cooperative, and compensated him with three mu of inferior fields more than a mile away. In Zhaping Cooperative, Shijiang Township, Hengyang, the fields of two individual farming households were in the middle of the cooperative's fields. The cooperative emphasized that the fields should be contiguous, and without the consent of these two households, sent thirteen cooperative members to dig up 1.6 mu and plant wheat. Some cooperatives insisted that individual households buy more public bonds, and some did not provide relief to households in difficulty, or provided less relief.
    The CPC Hengyang Prefectural Committee issued a circular on October 27, severely criticizing these phenomena. It pointed out that the consequences of this approach could be two-fold: one is to force all households into the cooperative in the short term, which will affect the production and consolidation of the cooperative; the other is to alienate individual households from the cooperative, and even lead to worse incidents. The Prefectural Committee requested all counties to take resolute measures to educate and guide cadres, cooperative cadres, and members. They must adopt a policy of unity, education, and enthusiastic assistance towards individual farmers. Even if there is only one household left, there must be no discrimination. Cooperatives should carry out ideological education for individual households, help them solve some difficulties in production and life, and invite them to participate in some cooperative meetings to raise their awareness and improve unity. On economic issues, individual households must not be treated harshly, and everything should be treated equally with cooperative members in accordance with the policy. The exchange of fields and land must be completely voluntary, and any infringement on the property of individual households that has occurred must be compensated in full. (Kuang Luan)

    衡阳地委通报不要歧视个体农户
    本报讯　中共湖南省衡阳地委正在采取措施，纠正各地在高级合作化以后发生的歧视、苛待单干农民的现象。
    衡阳地区在今年10月上旬基本完成高级农业合作化以后，还有5.1％的单干农民。有不少农业社对这些单干农民采取了讽刺、苛待、排挤等错误作法。常宁长岭乡联盟社，为了便于经营，将单干户郭怀德门口的三亩大丘强迫归社，另补给他一里多远的三亩差田。衡阳石江乡渣平社有二户单干农民的田在社的田的中间，社强调田要连片，不经这两户同意，就派了十三个社员挖了一点六亩种上麦子。有的社硬要单干户多买公债，有的不给困难户以救济或少给救济。
    中共衡阳地委10月27日发出通报，严厉地批评了这些现象。指出这种作法的后果有两个可能：其一是在短期内把所有的户都卡到社里来，将影响合作社的生产和巩固；其二使单干户远离合作社，甚至酿成更坏的事件。地委要求各县采取坚决措施，教育辅导干部、社干与社员，对单干农民必须采取团结、教育、热情帮助的方针，哪怕只剩一户也不能歧视。合作社对单干户要进行思想教育，帮助他们解决生产和生活上的一些困难，邀请参加社里的一些会议，以提高他们的觉悟，搞好团结。在经济问题上，绝不能苛待单干户，一切都应按政策与社员一视同仁。换田、换土必须完全自愿，已发生侵犯单干户财产的要如数补偿。（邝麓安）
