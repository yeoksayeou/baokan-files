Sun Yat-sen was a great patriot and revolutionary pioneer of our country, as well as an outstanding thinker and scientist. His lifelong pursuit of continuous revolution and progress was the result of his lifelong continuous study of science. When China was defeated in the Sino-French War in 1885, he had the ambition to "overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish the Republic of China." Around the time of the establishment of the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), he advocated revolution with the slogan "Expel the Tartars, restore China, establish the Republic of China, and equalize land ownership." From the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty, to around the May Fourth Movement, he completed works such as "The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction," "The General Plan of National Reconstruction," "The Three Principles of the People," and "Industrial Plan." These were the great achievements of Sun Yat-sen's national revolutionary thought and old democratic revolutionary thought. After the success of the great Russian October Revolution, his revolutionary ideas progressed with the times. In January 1924, he completed his revolutionary proposition of the "Alliance with Russia, Alliance with the Communist Party, and Assistance to Farmers and Workers" and issued the historically significant "Manifesto of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang," laying the foundation for overthrowing the rule of the Northern Warlords and creating the conditions for the new democratic revolution. After Mr. Zhongshan passed away, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, completed the bourgeois democratic revolution. Now, the socialist transformation has achieved a comprehensive and decisive victory, and socialist construction is flourishing. The People's Republic of China stands tall in the world as a large and strong nation. If Mr. Zhongshan were still alive today, his joy and excitement would be beyond the description of words.

Mr. Zhongshan's achievements lie in the fact that he studied medicine in his early years and acquired the natural science technique of "treating illnesses and saving people." In studying Chinese classical works, he inherited the traditional Chinese spirit of "the world belongs to all" and "the great harmony of the world." When the Chinese people were still living like slaves and cattle in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, Mr. Zhongshan's thinking had already progressed ahead of the English bourgeois democratic revolution of the seventeenth century and the French bourgeois democratic revolution of the eighteenth century. Since "learning from Russia," Mr. Zhongshan's thinking has surpassed that of all philosophers in capitalist countries. Because he advocated the doctrine of "knowing is difficult, doing is easy," his thinking never lagged behind objective practice. The so-called "knowing is difficult" means seeking knowledge through hard work, not the "agnosticism" of the bourgeoisie. The so-called "doing is easy" means implementing immediately after solving problems through scientific research, not "blindly rushing forward." Therefore, as the people of the whole country commemorate the 90th anniversary of the birth of Sun Yat-sen, I hope: 1. Comrades in the scientific community will emulate Sun Yat-sen's spirit of scientific research and work hard to study science in order to implement the call of the Party and the government to "march towards science." 2. Military and political personnel in Taiwan should immediately organize a delegation to visit the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing or participate in the commemorative meeting in Beijing, or organize a tour group to visit various places. "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times," which can help them understand what Sun Yat-sen meant by "knowing is difficult." 3. Senior military and political personnel in Taiwan should also recall a virtue of Sun Yat-sen, which is to prioritize the interests of the people and take personal interests lightly. For the sake of domestic peace, he twice resigned as President and twice abandoned the position of Grand Marshal. This spirit of "doing is easy" and "peaceful struggle to save China" of Sun Yat-sen is also what the 600 million people hope you will learn well.

    学习中山先生研究科学的精神
    胡庶华
    孙中山先生是我国伟大的爱国者和革命先行者，也是我国杰出的思想家和科学家，他一生继续不断地革命，继续不断地进步，是他一生继续不断地研究科学的成果。当中国在1885年中法战争失败时，他即有“颠复清廷，创建民国之志”。同盟会成立前后，他以“驱除鞑虏，恢复中华，建立民国，平均地权”号召革命。自辛亥推翻清朝帝制到“五四”运动左右，他完成了“建国方略”，“建国大纲”，“三民主义”，“实业计划”等著作，这是孙中山先生的民族革命思想和旧民主主义革命思想的伟大成就。俄国伟大的十月革命成功后，他的革命思想又随着时代的进步而进步，到1924年1月，完成了他的“联俄，联共，扶助农工”三大政策的革命主张，发出了有历史意义的“国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言”，奠定了推翻北洋军阀统治的基础，创造了新民主主义革命的条件。中山先生逝世以后，中国人民在中国共产党领导下完成了资产阶级民主革命，现在社会主义改造取得了全面的决定性的胜利，而社会主义建设又正在蓬勃发展中，中华人民共和国巍然屹立于世界蔚为大而且强的国家，中山先生假如今日尚在人间，他的喜悦和兴奋的心情，当非语言文字所能形容。
    中山先生之所以取得这些成就，在于他早岁学医，获得了自然科学中“治病救人”的技术，在学习中国经典著作中，他又继承了中国古代“天下为公，世界大同”的传统精神。当中国人民尚在半封建半殖民地社会里，过着奴隶牛马生活的时候，而中山先生的思想已进步到十七世纪英国资产阶级民主革命和十八世纪法国资产阶级民主革命的前面。自从“以俄为师”之后，中山先生的思想又超过了一切资本主义国家的哲学家们的前面。由于他倡导“知难行易”的学说，所以他的思想从来不落后于客观实践。所谓“知难”就是要从刻苦钻研中求知，而不是资产阶级的“不可知论”。所谓“行易”，就是要从科学研究中解决了问题之后，立即执行，而不是“盲目冒进”。因此，在全国人民纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年的时候，我希望：一，科学界的同志们效法孙中山先生研究科学的精神，努力研究科学，以贯彻党和政府“向科学大进军”的号召。二，台湾军政人员立即组织代表团到南京谒中山陵或到北京参加纪念大会，或组织参观团到各地参观，“百闻不如一见”，可以体会到孙中山先生所谓“知难”。三，台湾高级军政人员还要回忆孙中山先生的一种美德，就是人民利益为重，个人利益为轻；他为了国内和平，曾经两次辞去大总统，两次放弃大元帅而不为，孙中山先生这种“行易”和“和平、奋斗救中国”的精神，也是六亿人民希望你们好好学习的。
