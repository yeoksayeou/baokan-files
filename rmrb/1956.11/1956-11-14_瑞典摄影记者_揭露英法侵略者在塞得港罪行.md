    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 12th: The Egyptian Information Bureau published a statement by Swedish photojournalist Anderssen, who had been to Port Said after it was occupied by Anglo-French aggressor forces. In his statement, he said: "I feel that the terror and terrible methods of treating civilians that I saw in Port Said are something I have never seen anywhere else."

    He said that the Anglo-French aggressors believe that their attacks on Egyptian residents can be called "police actions." This means that they don't know what humanity is.

    Anderssen said: "I entered Port Said a few hours after the ceasefire was announced, and I found it to be a flaming, smoke-filled hell. I saw children searching for their parents among the ruins of houses destroyed by bombs, among the broken walls and rubble. I saw many parents digging with bloody hands in the rubble, searching for their dead children. I saw thousands of corpses behind some hospitals that had not been destroyed, in the ruins that were still smoking. Two hospitals were completely destroyed, and all nine hundred patients in the hospitals were killed. Can bombing the city, strafing civilian houses and streets with machine guns be called a 'police action'? I think this is terror and massacre."

    Anderssen pointed out that British officers tried to prevent him from leaving Port Said. He said: "People secretly brought me out of this hell, so that the whole world would know what the situation in Port Said was like. This is a disgrace to Britain. This is a stain that can never be washed away."

    The journalist said: "I interviewed residents in Port Said, doctors from the hospitals, the head of the fire brigade, and ordinary men and women. I saw the corpses of children and women with bullet wounds in their backs, who were killed while running to air-raid shelters. In the Gamalia district, six blocks of wooden houses were attacked with incendiary bombs. During the two hours I stayed here, I saw two hundred and seventy corpses being carried out of the rubble. There is nothing more to add to this situation. This tragic situation is beyond description."

    Anderssen's statement was accompanied by some photos he took in Port Said. The photos show the bombed-out city, and the corpses of women and children massacred by the aggressor forces. (Attached picture)

    瑞典摄影记者
    揭露英法侵略者在塞得港罪行
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社开罗12日讯：埃及情报局发表了瑞典摄影记者安德逊的谈话，这位瑞典摄影记者在塞得港被英法侵略军占领后曾到过那里。他在谈话中说：“我觉得我在塞得港所看到的那种对待平民的恐怖和可怕手段，是我从来没有在别的地方看到过的。”
    他说，英法侵略者认为他们对埃及居民的攻击可以称为“警察行动”。这就是说，他们不知道什么叫做人道。
    安德逊说道：“在宣布停火后几小时我进入了塞得港，我发现这是一个烈焰腾腾、浓烟漫弥的地狱。我看到，在被炸弹毁掉的房屋的废墟上，孩子们在断墙残垣中找寻他们的父母。我看到许多父母用流着血的双手在瓦砾中扒，找寻他们死掉的孩子。我看到，在有些没有被炸毁的医院的后面，在还冒着烟的废墟上有几千具尸体。两个医院完全被炸毁了，医院中的九百个病人全部被炸死。飞机轰炸市区、用机枪扫射民房和街道，这能够叫做‘警察行动’吗？我认为这是恐怖和屠杀。”
    安德逊指出英国军官企图阻挡他离开塞得港。他说：“人们秘密地把我从这个地狱带出来，好让全世界知道塞得港的情形怎样。这是英国的耻辱。这是永远洗刷不掉的污点。”
    这位记者说：“我曾在塞得港的居民中采访，从医院医生、消防队队长，普通的男男女女那里采访了消息。我看到了背上中弹的儿童和妇女的尸体，他们是在跑向防空洞的时候被打死的。在加马利亚区，有六个木板房的街区遭到燃烧弹的袭击。我在这里停留的两小时中就看见从瓦砾场中抬出二百七十具尸体。对这种情况再也不能补充什么了。这种惨状是笔墨难以形容的。”
    安德逊发表的谈话附有他在塞得港摄的一些照片。照片上是被炸毁的市区、被侵略军屠杀的妇女和儿童的尸体。（附图片）
