Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 23rd: According to the Polish Press Agency, "Worker's Tribune," a newspaper in Katowice, an industrial city in southwestern Poland, published the remarks made by Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz when he received its representatives regarding the Soviet-Polish talks and the joint statement.

    Regarding the question of how the coal supplied by Poland to the Soviet Union in the years after 1953 was settled, Cyrankiewicz said that from 1954 to 1956, the price of the coal we supplied was determined according to world prices. According to the method of fixing prices for one or two years adopted in trade between our two countries, the price of coal supplied to the Soviet Union was a few percent lower than the price of coal in other markets. Therefore, the prices of certain materials supplied by the Soviet Union to Poland were also correspondingly lower than world prices.

    The newspaper's representative asked: Gomulka said that Poland owed the Soviet Union more than two billion rubles. The Soviet-Polish joint statement said that the Soviet Union would grant Poland a long-term credit loan to purchase goods worth 700 million rubles. What kind of rubles are these referring to?

    Cyrankiewicz said: As far as the debt we owe is concerned, the rubles mentioned above are so-called clearing rubles, which are based on world prices. The value of one such ruble is many times higher than the value of the zloty in the Polish domestic market.

    The newspaper's representative asked: Who bears the cost of maintaining the Soviet military forces stationed on Polish territory?

    Cyrankiewicz said: The Soviet government bears the cost of the Soviet troops. The accounts for the goods supplied by Poland to these troops are settled according to the usual export prices. All labor services used by these troops must be paid for according to our regulations.

    西伦凯维兹解释苏波声明中一些具体问题
    据新华社华沙23日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰西南部工业城市卡托维兹的“工人论坛报”刊载了波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹接见它的代表的时候就波苏会谈和联合声明所发表的谈话。
    谈到1953年以后几年内波兰供给苏联的煤是用什么方法来结算账目的问题时，西伦凯维兹说，从1954年到1956年这段期间，我们所供给的煤的价格是按照世界价格的标准而定的。根据我们两国在贸易上采用了一、两年的固定价格的办法，供给苏联的煤的价格比其他市场上的煤的价格低百分之几，因此，苏联所供给波兰的某些物资的价格同时也相应地低于世界价格。
    这家报纸的代表问到：哥穆尔卡说过波兰欠苏联的债款多达二十亿卢布以上，苏波联合声明说苏联将给予波兰以长期信用贷款来购买价值七亿卢布的货物，这些所指的是什么样的卢布？
    西伦凯维兹说：如就我们所欠的债款而论，上面所指的卢布是所谓结算卢布，也就是以世界价格为根据的卢布。一个这样的卢布的价值比波兰国内市场兹罗提的价值要高好多倍。
    这家报纸的代表问：苏联军事部队驻在波兰领土上，是由谁负担维持这些军队的费用？
    西伦凯维兹说：负担苏联军队费用的是苏联政府。波兰供给这些部队的货物的账目按照通常的出口价格结算。这些部队所使用的一切劳务都要按照我们的规定付钱。
