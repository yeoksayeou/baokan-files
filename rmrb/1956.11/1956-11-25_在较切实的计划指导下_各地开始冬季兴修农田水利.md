Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: Most regions across the country have already begun winter farmland and water conservancy construction. Some regions started earlier; the farmland and water conservancy projects currently under construction in Heilongjiang Province already account for 30% of the total project volume for this winter and next spring. In Anhui Province, 109 farmland and water conservancy projects in 33 counties have completed over 160,000 cubic meters of earthwork. In Heze Prefecture, Shandong Province, more than 50% of the 10,000+ water wells destroyed by floods have been repaired. Winter construction work in other regions is also expanding rapidly.

This year's winter farmland and water conservancy construction plans in various regions are more realistic. At a recent water conservancy conference, Guangdong Province criticized the past tendency of blindly pursuing speed and scale, and revised its farmland and water conservancy project construction plans for this winter and next spring. In the past, water conservancy construction focused on the grain-producing areas of Chao汕 and the Pearl River Delta. Now, it has been decided to place the majority of water conservancy investment in Zhanjiang, Hainan and other prefectures where water and drought disasters are relatively serious, as well as old revolutionary base areas, ethnic minority areas, and hometowns of overseas Chinese, in order to accelerate the transformation of the economic landscape of these regions. According to natural conditions and needs, Zhejiang Province has decided to carry out projects such as repairing dikes, dredging rivers and canals, expanding water networks, and building small reservoirs and ponds in the plains north of the Qiantang River which are prone to flooding, the coastal plains which suffer from both drought and flooding and are affected by tidal erosion, and in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas. Hunan, Shandong, Anhui, Shaanxi, Gansu, Guizhou and other places have also been repairing existing farmland and water conservancy projects while carrying out new farmland and water conservancy project construction based on strengthened investigation and research and planning, in accordance with the needs of agricultural collectivization development.

In order to smoothly carry out winter farmland and water conservancy construction and ensure the quality of projects, many regions successively held water conservancy work conferences since August, and began to prepare the organization of manpower, materials, and financial resources. Anhui, Hunan and other provinces have established leading organizations for water conservancy construction at all levels. Water conservancy work cadres and experts from many provinces and regions have also organized working groups to go to various places to provide guidance.

    在较切实的计划指导下
    各地开始冬季兴修农田水利
    新华社22日讯　全国大部分地区已经开始冬季兴修农田水利。有些地区动工较早，黑龙江省目前修建的农田水利工程，已经占到今冬明春总工程量的30％。安徽省三十三个县兴修的一百零九个农田水利工程，已经完成十六万多个土方。山东省菏泽专区被洪水冲毁的一万多眼水井，已经修复了50％以上。其他地区的冬修工作也在迅速扩展。
    今年各地冬季兴修农田水利的计划都比较切合实际。广东省在最近举行的水利会议上，批判了过去的盲目求急求大的偏向，重新修订了今冬明春农田水利工程的修建计划。过去水利建设偏重于潮汕地区和珠江三角洲一带产粮地区，现在决定把大部分水利投资放在水旱灾害比较重的湛江、海南等专区，以及老革命根据地、少数民族地区和侨乡，以便加速改变这些地区的经济面貌。浙江省根据自然条件和需要，决定在钱塘江以北的平原易涝地区、旱涝兼有并且受海潮侵袭的沿海平原地区，以及在山区和半山区，分别进行修堤、疏浚河渠、增辟水网、修建小型水库和塘坝等工程。湖南、山东、安徽、陕西、甘肃、贵州等地也都根据农业合作化发展的需要，一面整修旧有的农田水利工程，一面在加强调查研究和规划的基础上进行新的农田水利工程建设。
    为了顺利开展冬季农田水利兴修工作和保证工程的质量，许多地区在8月份以来曾先后召开了水利工作会议，着手进行人力、物力、财力的组织准备工作。安徽、湖南等省都逐级建立了领导兴修水利工作的机构。许多省、区的水利工作干部和专家还组织工作组，前往各地指导。
