Xinhua News Agency, November 15th dispatch from Geneva: The Swiss Labour Party's Steering Committee published a statement on the current situation on November 8th in the "Workers' Voice" newspaper in Geneva, condemning the anti-Soviet and anti-communist movement stirred up by the West under the guise of the Hungarian event.

The statement reminded the Swiss people that "In the era of Hitler and Mussolini, hysterical anti-Soviet sentiment once helped prepare a world war, and this time, its consequences would be a much greater disaster for mankind."

When discussing the situation in Hungary, the statement expressed the Labour Party's sincere hope that the new Hungarian government would do everything possible to implement the necessary reforms in the shortest possible time, in order to heal the wounds suffered by the Hungarian people with the help of international solidarity.

The statement solemnly pointed out that those who silently tolerated or even agreed with and supported Hitler and Mussolini's bloody aggression against the Spanish people, those who were silent or expressed their agreement with the bloody suppression of the Algerian or Cypriot people's independence movement, and those who began to openly support the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, were not qualified to lecture Hungary.

In its statement, the Labour Party called on the Swiss people, especially the working class, not to participate in the current anti-communist movement, because this movement helps prepare for war, and at the same time, it will hinder Switzerland's social progress and worsen the living standards of the working people.

    瑞士劳动党发表声明
    谴责西方煽动反苏反共
    据新华社15日讯　日内瓦消息：瑞士劳动党指导委员会11月8日在日内瓦“工人之声报”上发表了关于当前局势的声明，谴责西方假借匈牙利事件所煽起的反苏反共运动。
    这篇声明提醒瑞士人民说：“在希特勒和墨索里尼时代，歇斯底里的反苏情绪曾经一度有助于准备一次世界大战，而这一次，其后果对人类来说将是大得多的灾难。”
    这篇声明在谈到匈牙利局势的时候表示，劳动党热切希望匈牙利新政府尽一切努力，以便在最短期间实行必需的改革，以便在国际团结的援助下医治匈牙利人民所遭受的创伤。
    声明严正地指出，那些默默容忍或甚至同意和支持希特勒和墨索里尼对西班牙人民进行血腥侵略的人们，那些对于血腥镇压阿尔及利亚或塞浦路斯人民独立运动哑口无言或者表示同意的人们，那些开始越来越公开地支持英法两国侵略埃及的人们，都没有资格对匈牙利说长道短。
    劳动党在声明中号召瑞士人民，特别是工人阶级不要参加目前掀起的反共运动，因为这一运动有助于准备战争，同时它会阻碍瑞士的社会进步和使劳动人民的生活水平恶化。
