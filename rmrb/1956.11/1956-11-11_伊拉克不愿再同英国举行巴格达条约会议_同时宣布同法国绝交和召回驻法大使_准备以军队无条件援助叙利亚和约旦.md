Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 10th: Iraq announced on November 9th that it was severing diplomatic relations with France and that it would no longer participate in Baghdad Pact conferences with Britain.

    The Iraqi government notified the French Ambassador to Iraq of its decision to sever diplomatic relations on the afternoon of November 9th. The Iraqi Ambassador to France was also ordered to return home as soon as possible. The Iraqi government's statement said that the decision to sever relations with France was due to France's long-standing attitude towards Arab countries, which hindered good relations between them.
    The Iraqi cabinet also decided that, despite the ceasefire in Egypt, Iraq was no longer willing to hold meetings with Britain as a member of the Baghdad Pact. The government statement said that Iraq would limit its Baghdad Pact activities to meetings with the three Muslim member states of Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 10th (TASS): According to Iraqi sources, large-scale demonstrations have been held in Baghdad in the past two days, with demonstrators firmly demanding effective aid to Egypt and demanding Iraq's immediate withdrawal from the Baghdad Military Pact.
    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 10th: The Iraqi government issued a communique on November 9th stating that Iraqi troops would immediately provide unconditional assistance to Syria and Jordan in the event of "danger of aggression."
    The communique also stated that Iraq advocates resolving the Palestinian issue in accordance with the 1947 United Nations resolution on the partition of Palestine. The communique said that the Iraqi government is making its greatest efforts in this regard.
    The communique also called on the governments and peoples of Arab countries to "cooperate courageously and patiently at this decisive moment."
    The Iraqi government recently held a meeting with the other three Muslim member states of the Baghdad Pact in Tehran. After the meeting, the Iraqi government issued this communique in Baghdad.
