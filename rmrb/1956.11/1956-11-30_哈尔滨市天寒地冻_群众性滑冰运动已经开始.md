    Harbin City is Freezing Cold:
    Mass Ice Skating Movement Has Begun
    (Our dispatch) Since several heavy snowfalls in Harbin, mass ice skating activities in many factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools have become active.
    The Municipal Sports Commission, the Federation of Trade Unions, and the Communist Youth League have made unified arrangements for winter sports activities, guiding grassroots organizations to carry out activities.
    This winter, in addition to Nangang, Children's, and People's Stadiums, the Municipal Sports Commission has also built a standard ice hockey rink suitable for international competitions on the artificial lake. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has also built two ice hockey rinks in the workers' lighted stadium, and a large speed skating rink in the Baqu Park.
    Currently, many outstanding ice athletes in Harbin are taking the lead in actively training at the Nangang ice rink, which has already been prepared. The Harbin Electric Motor Factory's ice rink has been prepared, and the ice hockey team has begun practicing on the ice. After the completion of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory's ice hockey rink, it held a friendly match with the Municipal No. 1 Middle School ice hockey team on the 18th. In addition to continuing to consolidate its original ice hockey team, the Harbin Woolen Mill will also vigorously develop speed skating and figure skating activities this winter. The ice rink in front of the Municipal People's Committee was opened on November 17th, and by the 19th, more than 1,000 people had participated in ice skating activities. Middle schools and above have generally built ice rinks and added ice skates. The Northeast Agricultural College has prepared three ice rinks and one ice mountain this winter, and has purchased 400 pairs of ice skates. According to the teaching requirements of ice sports, No. 17 Middle School also guarantees seven to ten hours of skating classes this semester. Many primary schools are also preparing to build small ice rinks and ice slides to meet children's demands for ice sports.
