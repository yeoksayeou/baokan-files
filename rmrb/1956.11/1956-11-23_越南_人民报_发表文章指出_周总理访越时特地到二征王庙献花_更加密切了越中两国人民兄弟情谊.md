Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 21st. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an article today entitled "Brotherly Friendship," stating that Premier Zhou Enlai specially presented flowers at the Hai Ba Trung Temple during his visit to Vietnam to express his respect for the Vietnamese national heroines. This moving event further cemented the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the people of Vietnam and the people of China.

The article said: Nearly two thousand years ago, two female national heroines led the Vietnamese people's predecessors in resisting great nationalism, waging a war of resistance against the invading troops of the Han Dynasty, and defending our freedom and independence.

The article said: The Chinese Communist Party pays special attention to opposing great nationalism. Today's China is greatly different from the China of the past. Great nationalism is being eliminated and replaced by brotherly friendship.

The article said: In 1949, shortly after the success of the Chinese Revolution, Chairman Mao Zedong instructed that "Zhennanguan" be renamed "Munan Pass." This matter has great significance.

The "People's Daily" also said that China was the first country to recognize the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. At the Geneva Conference, Chinese representative Comrade Zhou Enlai, together with the Soviet representative, worked hard to restore peace in Indochina. China has given Vietnam 800 million Chinese yuan and provided technical assistance to help Vietnam restore its economy and develop its culture.

    越南“人民报”发表文章指出
    周总理访越时特地到二征王庙献花  更加密切了越中两国人民兄弟情谊
    新华社河内21日电　越南“人民报”今天以“兄弟的情谊”为题发表文章说：周恩来总理在这次访问越南的时候，特地到二征王庙献花，表示对越南民族英雄的敬意。这件令人感动的事情，更加密切了越南人民同中国人民之间牢不可破的兄弟的情谊。
    文章说：近两千年以前，两位女民族英雄曾经领导越南人民的前辈反对大民族主义，进行抗战，反对汉朝的侵略军队，保卫我们的自由和独立。
    文章说：中国共产党特别注意反对大民族主义。今天的中国和过去的中国大大的不同了，大民族主义正在被清除，而代之以兄弟的情谊。
    文章说：在1949年，中国革命成功不久，毛泽东主席指示把“镇南关”改名为“睦南关”。这件事情具有重大的意义。
    “人民报”又说，中国是第一个承认越南民主共和国的国家。在日内瓦会议上，中国代表周恩来同志曾经同苏联代表一起为恢复印度支那的和平而努力斗争。中国赠送给越南八亿中国人民币，并且给了技术援助来帮助越南恢复经济和发展文化。
