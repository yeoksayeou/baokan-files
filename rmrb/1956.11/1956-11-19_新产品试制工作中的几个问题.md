Several Problems in New Product Trial Production

In recent years, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company has trial-produced more than 100 new steel products, but some problems still exist. With the increasing number of new steel product trial production tasks in the future, in order to make preparations as soon as possible, I would like to raise a few problems we have encountered in our work here, hoping that relevant departments will pay attention to solving them.

	I. There should be comprehensive planning

According to the national plan, some steel plants of Anshan Iron and Steel will only be able to complete their basic construction tasks and put them into production after a few years. However, some departments do not proceed from this actual situation and require Anshan Iron and Steel to trial-produce and supply the products of these plants this year. For example, the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Second Ministry of Machine Building require Anshan Iron and Steel to trial-produce and supply cold-rolled sheets, but the cold-rolling workshop has not yet been built. In order to avoid the occurrence of this phenomenon, the development plans of steel-using departments and the basic construction plans of steel plants should have unified planning.

The steel plants of Anshan Iron and Steel that have already started construction have a certain scope of tasks, varieties, and quality, according to their equipment conditions. Some new varieties can be trial-produced, but the existing plants need to be appropriately expanded. The high-quality steel plates needed by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant are products of this nature. The steel plates they want need annealing and pickling, but the existing medium plate plant of Anshan Iron and Steel does not have these equipments. To meet their requirements, the existing medium plate plant has to be expanded. This not only expands the task scope of the medium plate plant, but also affects the long-term development plan of this plant and the overall layout plan of the country. Relevant leading departments should consider such major issues as a whole.

	II. Strengthen planning

Trial production of new products in steel plants requires more use of all production equipment. This is a characteristic of steel plants because a steel plant can only produce one product at a time.

In the trial production of new products in Anshan Iron and Steel, there is a long-term unresolved problem, which is the contradiction between the trial production of new products and the production plan. On the surface, the trial production of new products also has a plan, but because it is not included in the general product production plan, it is essentially a plan outside the production plan. That is to say, when the general product production plan can be completed ahead of schedule, there is time to trial-produce new products. If the general product plan cannot be completed, then there is no time to carry out the trial production of new products, resulting in the failure of the new product trial production plan. In order to solve this problem, I think the overall control of new product trial production work should be transferred from the current technical department to the planning department. The new products to be trial-produced should first be included in the plan, and then the technical department will carry out the trial production through technical measures. Otherwise, it is only determined to trial-produce, but not scheduling it into the plan is still not guaranteed.

If the new product trial production plan is uniformly managed by the planning department, it is more convenient to solve temporary problems. Because whether it is an ordered product or a trial-produced new product, there are relatively urgent and deferrable distinctions. In this way, the planning department has a comprehensive grasp, arranges them according to their priorities, and unifies them. If there are any problems, they can be adjusted in a unified manner, and the problems are relatively easy to solve.

	III. Act according to technical conditions

The material-using departments and the production departments do not have a unified understanding of the technical conditions of some new products, and the technical conditions required by some material-using departments are unrealistic, which also brings many difficulties to the formulation of technical conditions. For example, for a new product trial-produced by a certain department, when discussing the technical conditions, they insisted on guaranteeing mechanical performance, and said that this was the opinion of Soviet experts. But when the Soviet experts came to Anshan Iron and Steel, they said that this requirement was not necessary. For another example, a certain plant requested the trial production of a new variety of steel, and successively put forward three different technical conditions. But when the Soviet experts from this factory came to Anshan Iron and Steel, they also said that such high requirements were not necessary. This situation happens frequently. We hope that when the material-using departments formulate the technical conditions for new products, they should instruct their technical departments to carefully formulate them, and then the person in charge should sign and implement them. The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has recently done a better job. The technical conditions they have recently put forward have been approved by the chief engineer of their plant, but there are not many units that do this at present.

	IV. Internal Work

To trial-produce new products, it is also necessary to strengthen the internal work of the enterprise. Some plants in Anshan Iron and Steel attach great importance to the trial production of new products, while some plants do not attach importance to it. The steel trial-produced by some plants has not been subjected to finishing and inspection for a long time, and some plants do not summarize after the trial production, resulting in the loss of the trial-produced new products. Some plants did not take samples according to the prescribed methods or made sampling errors, so that correct inspection could not be carried out after the trial production. The root cause of these problems is that, in addition to not attaching importance to this work ideologically, many units do not have a fixed organizational structure, and there is no dedicated person in charge. At present, the Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant, the Medium Section Steel Rolling Plant, and the Second Sheet Plant have successively established technical sections or technical offices to strengthen the specific leadership of this work, but other plants still do not have corresponding organizations. This is very wrong and should be corrected.

### 新产品试制工作中的几个问题

    新产品试制工作中的几个问题
    鞍山钢铁公司最近几年来，已经试制了一百多种钢材新产品，但也还存在一些问题。今后钢材新产品试制任务越来越多，为了早日作好准备，在这里把我们工作中所碰到的几个问题提出来，希望有关部门能注意加以解决。
      一、要有全面规划
    按照国家计划，鞍钢有些钢材厂是要在几年之后才能完成基本建设任务投入生产的。但有些部门却不从这一实际情况出发，要鞍钢今年就试制并且供应这些厂的产品。例如第一机械工业部和第二机械工业部要鞍钢试制和供应冷轧薄板，而目前冷轧车间还没有建造。为了避免这种现象的发生，钢材用料部门的发展计划和钢厂基本建设计划应当有统一的规划。
    鞍钢目前已经开工的钢材厂，根据设备情况，不仅任务有一定范围，品种和质量也是有一定范围的。有些新品种虽然可以试制，但需要对现有的厂进行适当的扩建。第一汽车制造厂需要的优质钢板，就是属于这类性质的产品。他们要的钢板需要退火和酸洗，而鞍钢现有的中板厂没有这些设备；要满足他们的要求，就得把现有的中板厂加以扩建。这不仅扩大了中板厂的任务范围，并将影响这个厂的远景发展计划和全国总的布置计划。像这样的重大问题，有关领导部门就应该加以统盘考虑。
      二、加强计划性
    钢材厂试制新产品更要占用全部生产设备，这是钢材厂的特点。因为一个钢材厂在同一时间内只能生产一种产品。
    鞍钢新产品试制中，有一个长期没有解决的问题，这就是新产品试制和生产计划的矛盾。表面上看起来新产品试制也有计划，但由于没有纳入一般产品生产计划以内，实质上只是生产计划外的计划，也就是说当一般产品生产计划能够提前完成的时候，新产品就有时间试制；如果一般产品计划完不成，那么就没有时间进行新产品试制，以致使新产品试制计划落空。为了解决这个问题，我认为新产品试制工作的全面掌握，应当从目前的技术部门转移到计划部门。把要试制的新产品首先纳入计划以内，然后由技术部门通过技术措施进行试制。否则只是确定要试制，但排不上计划仍然是没有保证的。
    新产品试制计划统一由计划部门管理，临时发生问题，解决起来也比较方便。因为不管是订货的产品，或者试制的新产品，都有比较紧急的和可缓办的区别，这样由计划部门全面掌握，分别轻重缓急统一安排，有了问题再统一加以调剂，问题是比较容易解决的。
    三、根据技术条件办事
    用料部门和生产部门对有些新产品的技术条件没有统一的认识，某些用料部门要求的技术条件不切实际，也给制定技术条件带来了很多困难。例如某部要求试制的某项新产品，在商订技术条件的时候，坚持要求保证机械性能，并且说这是苏联专家的意见。但苏联专家到鞍钢时说并不需要这项要求。另如某厂要求试制的某项新品种钢材，曾先后提了三个不同的技术条件。但当这个厂的苏联专家到鞍钢来的时候，也说用不着那么高的要求。这种情况是经常发生的。我们希望用料部门在拟订新产品技术条件的时候，应该责成他们的技术部门审慎拟订，然后由负责人签字执行。第一汽车制造厂最近作得比较好，他们最近提出的技术条件都是经过他们厂的总工程师批准过的，但这样作的单位目前并不多。
      四、内部的工作
    试制新产品，还需要加强企业内部的工作，鞍钢有些厂对新产品试制比较重视，有些厂就很不重视。有些厂试制的钢材竟长期不作精整和检查工作，有的厂试制以后不加总结，以致试制出来的新产品发生丢失的情形。有的厂没有按规定办法采取试样或者发生取样错误，以致试制后无法进行正确的检验。发生这些问题的根本原因，除掉思想上不重视这个工作以外，不少单位没有固定的组织机构，没有专人负责也有关系。目前鞍钢无缝钢管厂、中型轧钢厂和第二薄板厂都先后成立了技术科或技术室，加强这一工作的具体领导，但其他各厂，至今仍然还没有相应的组织。这是很不对的，应该改正这种作法。
