    Eleven County Volleyball Tournament Concludes
    Taishan and Helong Teams Win Men's and Women's Championships Respectively
    Xinhua News Agency report The Taishan County Men's Volleyball Team from Guangdong Province and the Helong County Women's Volleyball Team from the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province, with excellent records of ten wins in ten matches and eight wins in eight matches respectively, won the championships in the men's and women's groups in the 1956 Eleven County Volleyball Tournament.
    The Taishan County Men's Volleyball Team, known as the "Volleyball Hometown" of China, won all ten matches with an absolute advantage of three to zero.
    The strong Jinjiang County Men's Volleyball Team from Fujian Province suffered only one defeat in ten matches against the Taishan County team (men), and won the runner-up in the men's group with nine wins and one loss. The runner-up in the women's group was the Wangqing County team with eight wins and one loss. The third place winners in the men's and women's groups were the Fuqing County team and the Yanji County team, respectively.
    Many people believe that the superb skills of the Taishan County Men's Volleyball Team can indeed be compared with the top domestic teams. They are tenacious in fighting spirit, powerful in attack, and their players have relatively even skills. They generally can play "fast-paced ball" and make "diving saves."
    The Eleven County Volleyball Tournament, which started on the 11th, has now come to an end. The closing ceremony will be held on the 24th and prizes will be awarded to the winning teams.

    十一县排球锦标赛结束
    台山、和龙两队分别获男女冠军
    新华社讯　广东省台山县男子排球队和吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州的和龙县女排球队，在1956年十一县排球锦标赛中，分别以十战十胜和八战八胜的优异成绩获得了男子组和女子组的冠军。
    被称为中国“排球之乡”的台山县男子排球队在十场比赛中，都是以三比零的绝对优势战胜对方的。
    实力坚强的福建省晋江县男子排球队，在十场比赛中，仅在同台山县队（男）一战中受挫，以九胜一败的结果获得男子组亚军。获得女子组亚军的是九战八胜的汪清县队。男子组和女子组的第三名分别是福清县队和延吉县队。
    许多人认为，台山县男子排球队的高超技术，确能与国内第一流球队媲美。他们在比赛中斗志顽强，进攻力量强大，队员的技术比较平均，一般都能打“快板球”和“鱼跃救球”。
    从11日开始的十一县排球锦标赛，到今天为止，已经全部结束。24日将举行闭幕式并给优胜队发奖。
