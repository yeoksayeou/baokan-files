Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 28th: According to a survey by the Shandong Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, less than one-third of the province's more than 63,000 agricultural production cooperatives truly implement equal pay for equal work for male and female cadres. In most agricultural cooperatives, male and female cadres hold the same positions, but receive different treatment. Li Yun'gui, the female vice-chairman of the "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Dingtao County, and the male vice-chairman share the same work responsibilities and achieve similar results, but the male vice-chairman is allocated 115 workdays of subsidies for the year, while Li Yun'gui only receives 55 workdays of subsidies. In the Linqi area, many agricultural cooperatives pay their male chairmen two to five times more in labor remuneration than their female chairmen. Due to unreasonable labor remuneration, the work enthusiasm of some female cadres has been affected, and even the harmony of their families.

The Shandong Provincial Democratic Women's Federation believes that the reason for this problem is that in the past, attention was only paid to equal pay for equal work for male and female members, while insufficient attention was paid to equal pay for equal work for male and female cadres. At the same time, many cadres still hold the idea of ​​disregarding women. In order to properly solve this problem, the Shandong Provincial Democratic Women's Federation suggested that the Communist Party of China Shandong provincial organizations and agricultural production cooperatives inspect and rectify the phenomenon of unreasonable remuneration for female cadres during the autumn harvest distribution, in accordance with the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women.

    在山东许多农业社里
    男女社干部同工不同酬
    省妇联建议在秋收分配中纠正
    据新华社济南28日电　据山东省民主妇女联合会调查，全省六万三千多个农业生产合作社中，真正实行男女干部同工同酬的社不到三分之一。在大部分农业社里，男女干部担任同样职务，得到的待遇却不相同。定陶县“五一”农业社女副社长李云贵和男副社长同样分工担负一定工作，效果也差不多，但男副社长全年确定补助一百一十五个劳动日，而李云贵只补助五十五个劳动日。临沂专区有不少农业社男社长所得的劳动报酬比女社长高出两倍到五倍。由于劳动报酬不合理，现在已经影响到一部分女干部的工作积极性，甚至影响到她们家庭的和睦。
    山东省民主妇联认为，产生这一问题的原因，首先是过去只注重了男女社员的同工同酬，而对于男女干部的同工同酬注意不够；同时，在很多干部中，现在还存在着轻视妇女的思想。为了妥善地解决这个问题，山东省民主妇联建议中共山东省各级组织和农业生产合作社，在秋季收益分配中，根据男女同工同酬的原则，检查纠正女干部所得报酬不合理的现象。
