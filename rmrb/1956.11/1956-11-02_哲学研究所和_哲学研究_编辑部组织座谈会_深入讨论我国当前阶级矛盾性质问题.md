    Philosophy Institute and "Philosophical Research" Editorial Department Organize Symposium
    Deeply Discuss the Nature of Current Class Contradictions in China

    On October 22nd and 23rd, the Philosophy Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the editorial department of the monthly journal "Philosophical Research" jointly organized a symposium to discuss the nature of the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class during the transition period in China. More than twenty units were invited to attend, with over a hundred participants. The symposium was presided over by Comrade Pan Zinian, Director of the Philosophy Institute. This was the largest symposium held since the discussion of this issue in newspapers and magazines. The speeches were enthusiastic, with many debates, fully embodying the spirit of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."

    "Both Antagonistic and Non-Antagonistic"

    The symposium began with a representative from Ta Kung Pao introducing the basic situation of their organized discussions and the issues debated. Then, Ding Weizhi spoke on behalf of Li Xuekun, Ma Zhongyang, and himself.

    Ding Weizhi said: Contradictions can simultaneously possess both antagonistic and non-antagonistic aspects. He believes that the nature of a contradiction can change in the process of its development. Generally speaking, the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class is antagonistic, but this does not mean it is antagonistic at all times. The contradiction between the two classes can differ under special historical conditions. The Chinese national bourgeoisie has a dual character, so their contradiction with the working class also has a dual character, with both antagonistic and non-antagonistic aspects. Neglecting the latter means neglecting the particularity of the contradiction. However, antagonism and non-antagonism are not in a state of equilibrium; sometimes antagonism is the dominant aspect, and sometimes non-antagonism is the dominant aspect. When antagonism becomes dominant, the basic nature of this contradiction is antagonistic, but non-antagonism still exists. This change in the position and proportion of the dual nature is the process of transformation of the basic nature of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class.

    Zhou Liquan analyzed the concept of the nature of contradiction from a logical perspective. He believes that when studying the nature of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class, we must see both universality or commonality and particularity or individuality, and these two are connected. The nature of things includes both the universality and the particularity of contradictions, and the two are combined, both being the nature of things. Regarding antagonistic contradictions, he believes that the fundamental nature of antagonism and the forms of antagonistic struggle are both distinct and related. Antagonistic contradictions generally develop towards antagonistic forms of struggle, and only under special conditions do they take non-antagonistic forms. Conversely, the relationship between non-antagonistic contradictions and non-antagonistic forms of struggle is the same. He said that Comrade Huang Nansen's article pointed out that the nature of contradiction and the form of struggle are different, which is very important. However, he equated the fundamental nature with other natures, thus excluding the particularity of the contradiction. Guan Feng's criticism of this is correct. If we equate the nature of contradiction with the fundamental nature of contradiction, many problems cannot be explained clearly: the fundamental nature of the contradiction between the landlord class and the people, and between the national bourgeoisie and the working class, is antagonistic, which makes it impossible to distinguish between these two obviously different contradictions. Difference is always a difference in nature, and although the particularity of a contradiction is not its fundamental nature, it is also the nature of the contradiction. He said: The so-called "different qualities of contradictions can only be resolved with different qualities of methods." The quality he is referring to here includes both universality and particularity.

    Two Diametrically Opposed Opinions

    Guan Feng elaborated on his views at the meeting on the afternoon of the first day. He said that he believes antagonism reflects the particularity of the struggle of contradictions; antagonism always refers to struggle, not to unity. The nature of a contradiction can be examined from many aspects; antagonism only reflects the particular side of the nature of the struggle of the contradiction, and only reflects the form of a certain period of the struggle of the contradiction. Antagonism is an external antagonistic or conflicting form of struggle. Guan Feng said: "The main reasons for opposing my opinion are: external antagonism refers to the form of struggle, and form and nature cannot be confused; method and nature cannot be confused." He responded to this opposition by saying: contradictions have commonality and individuality. The commonality is: unity is relative, struggle is absolute. Antagonism and non-antagonism belong to the issue of the particularity of the struggle of contradictions, and the study of particularity should start with how the contradiction struggles. Struggle is absolute, but specific struggles have different forms. Here, the word "form" cannot be understood rigidly. The struggle between the two sides of a contradiction is the movement of the contradiction, the basic content of the contradiction. Antagonistic and non-antagonistic forms of struggle are two different forms of the movement of things; it is impossible to discuss whether a contradiction is antagonistic or non-antagonistic by leaving the movement and content of the contradiction, and by leaving the form of struggle. Secondly, antagonism cannot be simply attributed to exploitative relations. Exploiters can also have antagonism with each other. Exploitation is not the only factor determining antagonism; to examine what determines antagonism, we must not only look at the exploitative relations, but also at the relations between each side of the contradiction and other classes and strata, and the balance of power between the two sides of the contradiction. Third, there is a distinction between antagonistic factors and antagonistic contradictions; having antagonistic factors does not equal antagonism, and antagonism only develops when antagonistic factors develop. Guan Feng said: He used the term "antagonistic factors" because antagonistic factors do not exclude the contradiction from simultaneously having non-antagonistic factors, nor do they exclude the possibility that the struggle of the contradiction is not yet antagonistic. He also believes that once the subjective initiative policy is realized, it becomes an objective fact in turn; the Party and the state have stipulated a policy of peaceful transformation, mobilizing the masses to carry out struggles, which is a huge practical force that cannot but change the nature of the contradiction. In addition, Guan Feng criticized Feng Ding's article in Ta Kung Pao, which used the example of a cat eating a mouse without consciousness or theory to illustrate that there are no antagonistic contradictions in nature. He believes that this is inappropriate because whether there is antagonism or not is irrelevant to whether there is consciousness or theory.

    Feng Ding then spoke, saying: Comrade Guan Feng's views are worth discussing. Guan Feng looks at essence from the form of struggle, which is correct in principle, and essence cannot be separated from form, but the problem is that essence is gradually deepened. Exploitative relations are the commonality of the contradictions between various different exploiting classes and exploited classes. Although commonality is relatively poor, it is also the most essential. The conditions for the development of capitalism in China are changing, so the nature of the contradiction is also changing. However, the most essential feature of capitalism is the exploitation of surplus value, which still exists at present and has not yet completed its qualitative change. Although fixed interest has fundamentally changed capitalism, fixed interest is still based on the bourgeoisie's ownership of the means of production, and it is still the exploitation of the workers' surplus value. Therefore, not only does the contradiction still exist, but the contradiction is still antagonistic. The nature of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class has its intricate and complex particularity or individuality, but this individuality must not exceed its commonality—the mutually antagonistic nature of exploitation and being exploited, and it is this most essential relationship that determines the nature of the contradiction between them. Therefore, it is wrong to say that the nature of the contradiction is not antagonistic. He disagreed with Guan Feng's argument that the form in which the two sides of a contradiction struggle can determine the nature of the contradiction, believing that this is to determine its essence by form, and to negate its commonality by individuality. At the same time, he also opposed the view that the nature of contradiction is both antagonistic and non-antagonistic, as well as the view that it is antagonistic at one time and non-antagonistic at another. His reason is that essence is relatively fixed. He said that antagonistic contradictions are generally resolved through antagonistic forms, and it is special that they are resolved through peaceful forms. And in resolving antagonistic class contradictions, peaceful forms are only a supplement to antagonistic forms.

    Xiao Qian said in his speech that he basically agreed with Feng Ding's opinion, but he put forward further views. He said: "An antagonistic contradiction is a contradiction in which the interests of one group are based on harming the interests of another group." Antagonism includes exploitative relations, but it is not just exploitative relations, such as imperialists are all exploiters, but they can also have antagonism with each other. He said that the method of resolving contradictions is basically related to the nature of the contradiction, and content determines form; peaceful transformation is also backed by violence, so it is also an antagonistic method.

    Several Issues in Group Discussions

    Group discussions were held on the morning of the second day. In the group speeches, most of them basically agreed with Feng Ding's views, and some comrades supported Guan Feng's views.

    Some comrades raised the issue of research methods at the group meetings. Some comrades mentioned that the nature of a contradiction can only be understood by specifically analyzing the particularity of the contradiction, but many people's research methods start from concepts and use concepts to fit facts; what fits the concept of antagonism is called antagonism, and what does not fit the concept is called non-antagonism. But everyone has their own definition of the concept, and since the language is not consistent, it is difficult to reach a consensus. Someone further proposed that we should not entangle ourselves in the concept of antagonism, but should start from policies and facts. If the facts do not match the popular concepts, we should also respect the facts and revise the concepts. One comrade said: The commonality and individuality of contradictions are different in different countries, and the study of the development of things should especially focus on individuality. We should study many philosophical concepts from China's actual situation, and we can supplement and develop them. Some comrades proposed that the issue of concepts must still be studied. Now everyone has no doubts about the policy, and the disagreement lies in how to summarize it theoretically. Therefore, we cannot escape the discussion of concepts; clarifying the concept so that it is both logical and historical will help solve the problem.

    Some comrades believe that it is wrong for Guan Feng to confuse the nature and form of contradiction. The main contradiction and the antagonistic contradiction should also be distinguished, and Guan Feng confuses them. Some comrades said that Guan Feng leaves the commonality to talk about the particularity, and attempts to replace everything with form. Some people feel that if we explain social life according to Guan Feng's argument, many problems will not make sense; for example, in minority areas, we did not use land reform to resolve contradictions, and we would come to the conclusion that the contradiction between exploiters and exploited in minority areas is non-antagonistic. Someone also criticized Ding Weizhi for confusing the main contradiction and the secondary contradiction, and the antagonistic contradiction and the non-antagonistic contradiction; using the political and economic union between the two classes to cover up the fundamental opposition of their interests. Some comrades said that the exploitative relationship is the focus of the nature of the contradiction, so antagonism is the fundamental nature. Many comrades expressed that they could not agree with Xiao Qian's statement that peaceful transformation is also antagonism. There was an opinion at the meeting that the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class in China is antagonistic in the economy and non-antagonistic in politics. Generally speaking, the economic aspect is the main aspect, but in China at present, the political aspect is the main aspect, so it is non-antagonistic; after the whole industry is jointly operated, it cannot be said that there is antagonism in the economy. The meeting also talked about the issue of whether there are antagonistic contradictions in nature. Everyone believed that further research is needed, and especially hoped that natural scientists would participate in the discussion.

    Understanding of "Peaceful Transformation"

    Ai Siqi spoke at the conference on the afternoon of the 23rd, believing that the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class is antagonistic. He said that the research method must abide by principles on the one hand, and start from facts on the other hand, and facts are the most important. Comrade Guan Feng only paid attention to the method of resolving contradictions and ignored the position of the contradiction, but this is the first issue. From the perspective of commonality, the bourgeoisie and the working class are in a position of exploitation and being exploited, which is essentially conflicting. We should affirm that the contradiction between them is antagonistic based on this. Although the most fundamental nature contains conflict, it does not necessarily manifest itself as a form of conflict. Since the nature is antagonistic, antagonism cannot be completely avoided in the resolution process. From the perspective of individuality, the Chinese national bourgeoisie has weaknesses, which makes their antagonistic material strength not great. Antagonism has its commonality and its individuality, and weakness is its antagonistic individuality, not that individuality is non-antagonistic. This weakness, coupled with the fact that the national bourgeoisie has common ground and progressiveness with the working class in politics, has weakened antagonism. But this does not mean that there is no antagonism, and the process of peaceful transformation still contains some antagonism. Ai Siqi said that regarding the form of struggle, there is a view at the meeting that it seems that the form of antagonism is an outbreak, or that peaceful struggle is non-antagonistic. He believes that peaceful transformation can include many non-antagonistic struggles, but it does not mean that it is non-antagonistic in nature. He said: "Here, I do not completely agree with Comrade Feng Ding. I believe that peaceful transformation includes both non-antagonistic struggles and antagonistic struggles. The peaceful path means that we can avoid the method of war, maintain the united front, unite and struggle, seek unity through struggle, and carry out conflicts and antagonism within the united front." Therefore, the peaceful path and the non-antagonistic form are not the same thing. An outbreak is a form of antagonism, but it is not the only form; the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns were antagonistic, but they were not outbreaks.

    Before the symposium ended, Pan Zinian made a speech, affirming the practical significance of this discussion, and said that the discussion still needs to be continued and that this symposium cannot draw any conclusions. His personal opinion is basically the same as that of Feng Ding and Ai Siqi. What needs to be supplemented is the role of the regime in resolving antagonistic contradictions. He said that our seizure of power is also the first step in the struggle against the bourgeoisie. The problem afterwards is the problem of ownership. With political power and control of the economic lifeline, peaceful transformation is possible. But to seize political power and economic lifeline, we must have armed forces, which is the backing of peaceful transformation and a material thing. He believes that contradictions cannot be transformed from antagonistic to non-antagonistic. Before the bourgeoisie is eliminated, contradictions are only quantitative changes. The contradiction is basically resolved, but it is not completely resolved. After public-private partnership, there are still issues of public and private ownership, and there is still antagonism. Regarding the issue of research methods, he believes that there is not enough discussion of specific processes in the discussion, so the concepts seem empty.

    This symposium was relatively successful. Everyone conducted a more in-depth discussion on some issues, which is helpful for further展开展开 the discussion on this issue. In order to further study, the Philosophy Institute and the editorial department of the monthly journal "Philosophical Research" will organize academics to conduct more in-depth discussions.

    哲学研究所和“哲学研究”编辑部组织座谈会
    深入讨论我国当前阶级矛盾性质问题
    10月22、23日，中国科学院哲学研究所和“哲学研究”月刊编辑部联合组织了一次座谈会，讨论我国过渡时期民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾性质的问题。应邀出席的共有二十多个单位，一百多人。座谈会由哲学研究所所长潘梓年同志主持。这是从报刊上讨论这个问题以来召开的最大的一次座谈会，会上发言很热烈，有不少争论，充分体现了百家争鸣的精神。
    “既有对抗性，又有非对抗性”
    座谈会首先由大公报社的代表介绍了他们组织讨论的基本情况和争论的问题。接着由丁伟志代表李学昆、马仲扬和他自己发言。
    丁伟志说：矛盾的对抗性与非对抗性是可能兼有的。他认为，矛盾的性质在发展过程中是可以变化的。一般说来，资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾是对抗性的，但不能就此说在任何时候都是对抗性的。两个阶级的矛盾在特殊的历史条件下可以有所不同。中国民族资产阶级有两重性，因此他们和工人阶级的矛盾也有两重性，除了对抗性外还有非对抗性，忽视了后者就是忽视了矛盾的特殊性。但对抗性与非对抗性并不是处于平衡状态的，有时对抗是主导的一面，有时非对抗是主导的一面。当着对抗性成为主要的时候，这一矛盾的基本性质就是对抗的，但非对抗性也仍存在着。这种两重性质的位置的变化、比重的变化，也就是中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾基本性质的转化过程。
    周礼全从逻辑上分析了矛盾性质的概念。他认为我们在研究中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾的性质时，既要看到普遍性或共性，又要看到特殊性或个性，这两者是联系的。事物的性质既包括矛盾的普遍性也包括矛盾的特殊性，两者是结合在一起的，两者都是事物的性质。关于对抗性的矛盾，他认为，根本性质的对抗和对抗的斗争形式也是既有分别又有联系的。对抗性的矛盾一般说来是向对抗性斗争形式发展的，只有在特殊的条件下才采取非对抗的形式，反过来，非对抗性的矛盾和非对抗性斗争形式的关系也是这样。他说，黄枬森同志的文章中提出矛盾的性质和斗争的形式是不同的，这很重要。但他把根本性质和其他性质等同起来，因而就排除了矛盾的特殊性，这一点关锋同志的批评是对的。如果把矛盾的性质和矛盾的根本性质等同，就有很多问题说不清楚：地主阶级和人民之间、民族资产阶级和工人阶级之间，矛盾的根本性质都是对抗的，这就无法区别这两种显然不同的矛盾了。不同总是性质的不同，矛盾的特殊性虽不是根本性质，但也是矛盾的性质。他说：所谓“不同质的矛盾，只有用不同质的方法才能解决。”这里所说的质，他认为既指普遍性也指特殊性。
    针锋相对的两种意见
    关锋在第一天下午的会上申述了自己的意见，他说：他认为对抗是反映矛盾斗争的特殊性的；对抗总是指斗争，不是指同一。矛盾的性质可以从多方面去考察；而对抗只是反映了矛盾斗争性质的特殊的一面，而且只是反映矛盾斗争的某一时期的形式。对抗是外部对抗或冲突的斗争形式。关锋说：“反对我的意见的主要理由是：外部对抗是指斗争形式，形式与性质不能混为一谈；方法和性质不能混为一谈。”他回答这种反对意见说：矛盾有共性和个性。共性是：统一是相对的，斗争是绝对的。对抗与非对抗是属于矛盾斗争的特殊性的问题，而研究特殊性应从矛盾怎样斗争着手。斗争是绝对的，但具体斗争有不同的形式。在这里不能死板的了解“形式”一词。矛盾双方的斗争，就是矛盾的运动、矛盾的基本内容，对抗和非对抗的斗争形式就是事物运动的两种不同形态；离开矛盾的运动、内容，离开斗争的形式来谈矛盾是对抗还是非对抗是不成的。其次，对抗也不能只简单地归结为剥削关系，同是剥削者，相互之间也可以发生对抗，剥削不是决定对抗的唯一因素；考察对抗是由什么决定的，不但要从剥削系关来看，还要从矛盾双方各和其他阶级、阶层的关系、矛盾双方力量对比来看。第三，对抗的因素和对抗性的矛盾有区别；有对抗因素不就等于对抗，对抗因素发展起来才成为对抗。关锋说：他使用“对抗性因素”这个名词，因为对抗性因素并不排斥矛盾同时具有非对抗的因素，也不排斥矛盾的斗争可能还不是对抗的。他并认为，主观能动性的政策一旦实现，就反过来成为客观的事实；党和国家规定了和平改造的政策，动员群众进行斗争，这就是一个巨大的实际力量，不能不使矛盾性质发生变化。此外，关锋对冯定在大公报上发表的文章中，以猫并不是有意识有理论地去吃老鼠为例来说明自然界没有对抗性矛盾这一点，提出了批评。他认为这是不妥当的。因为对抗与否和有没有意识和理论的问题不相干。
    冯定接着发言，他说：关锋同志的意见是值得讨论的。关锋从斗争的形式来看本质，原则上是对的，本质不能离开形式，但问题在于本质是逐步深入的。剥削关系是各种不同的剥削阶级和被剥削阶级之间的矛盾的共性，共性虽是比较贫乏的，却也是最本质的。中国资本主义发展的条件是在变化的，所以矛盾性质也在变化。但资本主义最本质的特征是剥削剩余价值，这一点在目前仍存在，并没有最后完成质变。定息虽然使资本主义起了根本意义的变化，但定息终究还是根据资产阶级对生产资料的所有权而来的，还是对工人的剩余价值的剥削，所以，不仅还存在着矛盾，而且矛盾还是对抗性的。中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾性质是有其错综复杂的特殊性或个性的，但是这种个性决不能超出其共性——剥削和被剥削的相互对抗性质，正是这种最本质的关系决定了他们之间的矛盾性质。因此，说矛盾的性质不是对抗的，是不对的。他不同意关锋的矛盾双方怎样进行斗争的形式可以决定矛盾性质的论点，认为这是以形式来决定其本质，以个性来否定其共性。同时他也反对矛盾性质既有对抗又有非对抗的看法，以及某一时期对抗某一时期不对抗的看法。他的理由是：本质是相当固定的。他说，对抗性质的矛盾通过对抗形式来解决，这是一般的，通过和平形式来解决，这是特殊的。而在解决对抗性质的阶级矛盾中，和平形式总不过是对抗形式的补充罢了。
    萧前在他的发言中说他基本上同意冯定的意见，但他提出了进一步的看法。他说：“对抗性矛盾是一个集团的利益建立在损害另一个集团利益的基础上的矛盾。”对抗包括剥削关系，但不止是剥削关系，如帝国主义者都是剥削者，但他们之间也可以有对抗。他说，解决矛盾的方法基本上是和矛盾的性质相联系的，内容是决定形式的；和平改造也是有暴力作后盾的，所以也是对抗的方式。
    小组讨论中的若干问题
    第二天上午进行了分组讨论。在小组发言中，多数是基本上同意冯定的看法的，也有若干同志支持关锋的看法。
    小组会上有些同志提出了研究方法的问题。有的同志提到：只有具体分析矛盾的特殊性才能了解矛盾的性质，但不少人的研究方法是从概念出发，用概念去套事实；合乎对抗这个概念的就叫它对抗，不合乎这个概念的就叫它非对抗。但各人又都有自己对概念的定义，语言既不一致，看法也就难得一致了。有人就进一步提出，不应该纠缠在对抗的概念上，应该从政策和事实出发，如果事实和流行的概念不合时，也应该尊重事实，修正概念。有位同志说：矛盾的共性和个性是各国不同的，而研究事物发展尤应重视个性，许多哲学上的概念我们应该从中国的实际出发来研究，对它们可以有所补充和发展。有的同志提出概念问题也还是必须研究的，现在对政策大家都没有怀疑，分歧在于如何从理论上概括，因此就不能逃避对概念的探讨；弄清概念，使它既合乎逻辑又合乎历史，就有助于问题的解决。
    有些同志认为关锋将矛盾的性质和形式混为一谈是不对的。主要矛盾和对抗性矛盾也应该区分，而关锋将它们混淆了。有的同志说，关锋离开了共性来谈特殊性，企图用形式来代替一切。有人觉得如果照关锋的论点来解释社会生活，那么许多问题会讲不通；如在少数民族地区我们没有用土地改革的办法来解决矛盾，就会得出少数民族地区剥削者和被剥削者间的矛盾是非对抗性的结论。有人也批评丁伟志把主要矛盾和次要矛盾，对抗性矛盾和非对抗性矛盾混同了；用两个阶级间政治经济上的联合来掩盖他们之间的根本利益上的对立。有的同志说，剥削关系是矛盾性质的重点，所以对抗是根本性质。不少同志表示不能同意萧前所说的和平改造也是对抗。会上有一种意见认为：我国民族资产阶级和工人阶级在经济上是对抗性的，在政治上则是非对抗性的，一般说来经济方面是主要的，但在目前的中国，政治方面是主要的，所以是非对抗性的；在全行业合营后，经济上也不能说有对抗性。会上还说到自然界有无对抗性矛盾的问题，大家认为需要进一步研究，特别希望自然科学家们来参加探讨。
    对“和平改造”的认识
    艾思奇在23日下午的大会上发言，他认为民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾是对抗性的。他说，研究方法一方面要遵守原则，一方面要从事实出发，而事实是首要的。关锋同志只注意到解决矛盾的办法，而忽视了矛盾所处的地位，但这是第一位的问题。从共性讲，资产阶级和工人阶级处于剥削与被剥削的地位，本质上带有冲突性质。正应该根据这一点来肯定它们之间的矛盾是对抗性的。虽然最根本的性质包含着冲突，但不一定明显地表现为冲突的形式。既然性质是对抗的，在解决过程中也就不能完全避免对抗。从个性讲，我国民族资产阶级具有软弱性，这就使他们对抗的物质力量不大。对抗有其共性，也有其个性，软弱性即其对抗的个性，并不是个性是非对抗的。这种软弱性加上民族资产阶级在政治上和工人阶级有共同点、有进步性，就都减弱了对抗性。但这并不能说无对抗，和平改造过程中也还是包含一些对抗的。艾思奇说，关于斗争的形式，会上有一种看法，好像对抗的形式就是爆发，或者说和平斗争就是非对抗。他以为，和平改造可以包含许多非对抗的斗争，但不等于就是非对抗性质。他说：“这里我和冯定同志不完全一致。我认为和平改造既包括非对抗斗争，也包括对抗斗争。和平的道路是说可以不采取战争的方式，保持统一战线，又团结又斗争，以斗争求团结，在统一战线内部进行冲突、对抗。”因此和平道路和非对抗形式不是一回事。爆发是对抗的一种形式，但并非是唯一的形式；“三反”“五反”是对抗，但并非爆发。
    在座谈会结束前，潘梓年作了发言，他肯定了这次讨论的实际意义，并说讨论还待继续展开，这次座谈会还不能作出什么结论。他个人意见和冯定、艾思奇的基本相同，需要补充的是政权在解决对抗性矛盾上的作用。他说我们夺取政权也就是对资产阶级斗争的第一步。以后的问题则是所有制的问题。有了政权、掌握了经济命脉，和平改造才可能。但要掌握政权和经济命脉都要有武装，这是和平改造的后盾，是物质的东西。他认为矛盾不能从对抗转化到非对抗。资产阶级消灭前矛盾都只是量变。矛盾基本解决了，并不是完全解决了。公私合营后还是有公有私、有所有制问题，就还有对抗。关于研究方法问题，他认为讨论中对具体过程探讨得不够，因此概念显得空虚。
    这次座谈会是开得比较成功的。座谈会中大家对一些问题作了比较深入的探讨，对于进一步展开关于这个问题的讨论是有帮助的。为了更进一步地研究，哲学研究所和“哲学研究”月刊编辑部将组织学术界人士作更深入的讨论。
