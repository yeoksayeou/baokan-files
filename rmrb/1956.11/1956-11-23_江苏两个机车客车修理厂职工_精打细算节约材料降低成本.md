(Dispatch from our newspaper in Nanjing) The employees of the state-owned Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory and Puzhen Passenger Car Repair Factory are practicing careful calculation and strict economy everywhere. The Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory saved a total of 784 tons of new steel and 491 cubic meters of timber in August, September, and October, which can be used to manufacture sixty freight trains. The Puzhen Passenger Car Repair Factory saved raw materials worth 690,000 yuan in the ten months since the first quarter of this year, and overfulfilled the cost plan.

Both of these factories are relatively large-scale repair factories. Therefore, their greatest source of savings is to fully utilize materials dismantled from old carriages to replace new materials. When inspecting and repairing freight cars and locomotives, the employees of the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory established a system for visual inspection and approval of major parts during inspection, correcting the wasteful phenomenon of dismantling all parts in the past, and fully utilizing old steel wheels, wheel axles, steel plates, and other materials, while ensuring quality. The utilization rate of old timber has also increased from 21% in the first half of the year to 37%. At the same time, technicians and workers jointly studied and compiled thirty-six types of tangential sawing operation cards, sawing timber according to the diameter of each log and the specifications required for freight cars. In October, the finished product rate of raw timber increased by 4.9% compared to the original target. Since January of this year, the Puzhen Passenger Car Repair Factory has implemented a workshop economic accounting system throughout the factory. Each workshop formulates specific savings plans on a monthly basis based on the targets issued by the factory, and conducts competitions with each other. The accounting department also promoted "detailed budget recording" in the passenger car system, so that employees know the profit and loss situation and identify weak links before starting to repair each carriage. After these measures were implemented, a spirit of careful calculation emerged throughout the factory.

    江苏两个机车客车修理厂职工
    精打细算节约材料降低成本
    本报南京电　国营戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂与浦镇客车修理厂的职工们，处处精打细算，厉行节约。戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂在8、9、10三个月中共节约新钢材七百八十四吨，木材四百九十一立方公尺，可以制造六十辆货物列车。浦镇客车修理厂从今年一季度以来的十个月内，节约原材料价值达六十九万元，成本计划超额完成。
    这两个工厂都是规模较大的修理性质的工厂。因此，他们节约的最大源泉，就是充分利用旧车厢上拆下来的材料代替新料。戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂职工在检修货车、机车时，建立了检修时的外观检查和主要配件审批制度，纠正了过去把机件全部拆光的浪费现象，充分利用了旧的钢轮、轮轴、钢板等材料，而且保证质量。旧木材的利用率也由上半年的21％提高到37％。同时，技术人员与工人共同研究编制了三十六种围心锯解操作卡片，根据每根原木直径的大小和货车要求的规格来解锯木材，10月份原木制成率已比原指标提高4.9％。浦镇客车修理厂从今年1月份起，便在全厂推行了班组经济核算制，每个班组都根据厂部下达的指标，逐月订出具体的节约计划，互相展开竞赛。会计部门又在客车系统推行了“细录预算”，使职工们在开始修理每节车厢以前，就知道盈亏情况，找出薄弱环节。这些措施实行以后，在全厂出现了精打细算的风气。
