How to Improve and Develop Translation Work
Zeng Yanxiu

Currently, the long-term plans of relevant departments for translating important world academic works have been preliminarily finalized. The list of books is extensive. Taking philosophy, social sciences, and international relations as examples, the preliminary catalog already exceeds a thousand titles, and most of them are relatively complex and lengthy. To accomplish this arduous task within twelve years, it is necessary to make intensive efforts and adopt certain necessary measures. To complete this significant task and generally improve our translation work, I believe that the following issues need to be addressed.

First, let's discuss the guiding principles of translation work. Here, I will focus on philosophy and social sciences. Since liberation, there has been a high tide of learning Marxism-Leninism in our country, and there has been a particular need for translations in this area. In fact, we have translated many good books, which have played a positive role in improving our scientific level, especially in the ideological transformation of intellectuals and the establishment of a communist worldview. However, in the past six or seven years, there have been significant shortcomings in our work in this area. This is because the entire translation work in philosophy and social sciences has been somewhat blind and characterized by laissez-faire and a lack of management. The most prominent manifestation of this shortcoming is the lack of seriousness in selecting books for translation. In some cases, it is difficult to see any selection process at all. The editorial departments and translators of some publishing houses lack correct ideological guidance when doing this work. They do not seriously study the contents of the original books. Regardless of whether they are nutritious or valuable, they translate them if they encounter them, and they do not translate them if they don’t. There is no planning at all. As a result, while many good books have been published, many books and pamphlets with relatively low levels, that is, dogmatic books that are empty and lack persuasiveness, have also been published. These publications of poor quality, whether in terms of their theoretical level, data collection, research methods, or writing methods, have few merits.

What is the fundamental purpose of publishing translations?

The purpose is to inherit and absorb the advanced cultural and scientific achievements of all nations in the world to help our country's socialist construction, improve our cultural and scientific level, and promote and stimulate our scientific research. There are so many publications in the world that we certainly cannot translate them all. We must be selective. What should we select? This requires a principle. This principle is that all translation work must revolve around the above-mentioned fundamental purpose. The translation of any book or article should contribute to the completion of the above tasks to a greater or lesser extent. This requires taking what others have and supplementing what we lack; taking what others are good at and supplementing what we are weak in; taking what others have refined and supplementing what we have crude. In short, we must aim high. Otherwise, it may lead to a waste of human and material resources. Specifically, we must follow the following principles. First, we must select those works that have advanced scientific levels and creativity, those works that are the latest and highest scientific research results in the current stage in their respective fields. Second, we must select the outstanding cultural achievements of all nations that have been preserved in history, those important works and representative works of various schools of thought, especially advanced schools of thought, that have had a significant impact on the progress of mankind. Third, we must select those works that have abundant modern data or historical data. Fourth, we must select those areas that we usually call gaps or particularly weak departments in our country's scientific work. Although the level of some original works in this category is not very high, they can also be translated because no one in our country has seriously studied them. Finally, we must select outstanding general and popular readings that can serve as examples or references in writing methods. The intermediate and popular readings of a country, especially such readings in philosophy and social sciences, should be mainly solved by their own works, because such readings particularly need to be written in connection with the national conditions in order to achieve results.

Here, let us briefly discuss the relationship between promoting authorship and establishing correct translation work principles. I believe that in order to improve the quality of translated books and promote publishing institutions to strive to flourish creation, publishing management agencies need to stipulate the ratio of works to translations in certain publishing houses and change the current situation where translations account for most or all of the books published by some publishing houses (except for those that specialize in publishing translations). In this way, the number of books published annually by some publishing houses may temporarily decrease, and it does not matter if it temporarily decreases. For example, it should be stipulated that publishing institutions must seriously treat translations, and publishing houses should never blindly select and translate books without knowing the contents of the original books in advance. Translators should also have an in-depth understanding of the contents of the original works and provide a responsible introduction to the publishing house. Everyone should understand that there is value in translating before starting to translate.

Second, we need to talk about exploring potential translation power and the organization of translation power. At present, we have not yet formed a strong team of translators. In the past few years, it has been difficult not only to organize the translation of classical academic works, but also to organize the translation of current lengthy works. If we continue to do it the old way, it is unlikely that we will be able to complete the long-term translation plan. In order to ensure that we can complete the current and long-term translation work in the plan, I think that the following measures can and should be gradually adopted: First, teachers and teaching and research groups in various universities can include the translation of certain classical academic and literary works in their research plans. Because, in order to translate these books well, it is necessary to read a lot of books and conduct a lot of research work, and these books are first needed by teachers and students in universities. Therefore, it is necessary for teachers in universities to undertake this task and should not be regarded as "not doing their job." Second, we must fully organize and give play to the power of translators scattered in agencies, schools, enterprises, and society. Some of them have relatively high language proficiency and professional knowledge. Due to the lack of organization, although they have interdependent relationships with publishing institutions, there is no medium to connect them. Therefore, we suggest that relevant departments and publishing houses should regularly invite translators to hold forums, strengthen connections, and solve their various difficulties at any time. In addition, the remuneration for the translation of classical academic works and famous literary works should be appropriately increased. This is a very laborious task, and the requirements for the translated manuscripts are relatively strict. It is reasonable to appropriately increase the translation remuneration for such books.

Finally, we need to talk about how publishing houses handle translated manuscripts. The editors of publishing houses are accustomed to checking the original text word by word against the translation, but the editorial manpower is very limited. Therefore, some books have to sleep in the editorial room after being translated. They cannot be published for one or two years, which greatly damages the enthusiasm of the translators. The People's Publishing House and Sanlian Bookstore have had this problem for a long time, and they have not completely overcome it yet. I believe that the editor does not have the responsibility to check the entire book word by word for the translator. It is the translator's and proofreader's own business to make the translation perfect and readable. It is not right for some irresponsible translators to place their hopes on the editorial department's repeated revisions. The editor's responsibility is to fully understand the translator's ability in advance by themselves and by consulting experts, and to try to understand the quality of the translated manuscript during the translation process to determine whether to accept it. The already translated manuscript can be roughly judged from reading the translation, and a part of it can be extracted and studied against the original text; then, some more important opinions can be put forward for the translator to consider and revise. If the level of the translated manuscript is too low and it can only be barely used after relying on the editor's repeated revisions, it is not enough for publication and can only be temporarily rejected with reason, but cannot be re-translated by the editor on behalf of the translator. However, some publishing houses are accustomed to doing this, which should be corrected.

Translation work is like transporting seeds from abroad and planting them in the soil of China to make them flourish. If done well, it will greatly help improve the level of Chinese culture and science. The significance of this work is very significant. We should not look down on this work, but should develop and improve this work as soon as possible.

    如何改进和发展翻译工作
    曾彦修
    现在，各有关部门关于翻译世界重要学术著作的长远规划，已经初步定出来了。书目繁多，仅以哲学、社会科学、国际关系这一方面而论，初步目录已在千种以上，而且大多数是比较艰深和篇幅较大的。要在十二年内完成这个艰巨的任务，是非作种种紧张的努力和采取一些必要的措施不可的。为了完成这个重大的任务和一般地改进我们的翻译工作，我觉得有如下一些问题需要加以解决。
    首先，让我们来谈谈翻译工作的方针问题。这里仅以哲学、社会科学为例。解放以来，我国学习马克思列宁主义的热潮是很高的，对于这方面的翻译书感到了特别的需要。事实上我们也译出了不少的好书，这对于提高我们的科学水平，特别是对知识分子的思想改造和共产主义世界观的建立，是起了良好作用的。但是，过去六、七年，我们在这方面的工作却还有不小的缺点。这就是整个哲学、社会科学翻译工作有盲目性，存在着放任自流、无人管理的状态。这个缺点的突出的表现，就是对于翻译书的选择很不认真，在某些情形下，甚至看不出有什么选择来。有些出版社的编辑部和翻译者，在做这件工作时，缺乏一种正确的思想指导，根本不去认真研究原书的内容，不管有没有营养，有没有价值，碰上就译，碰不上就不译，一点规划也没有。结果，便在出版了不少好书的同时，也出版了不少水平比较低的，即内容空洞的没有什么说服力的教条主义的书和小册子。这些质量不高的出版物，无论就它的理论水平、资料采集、研究方法和写作方法来说，可取的地方都不多。
    我们出版翻译书的根本目的何在呢？
    目的在于继承和吸收世界各民族先进的文化科学成果，用以帮助我国的社会主义建设，提高我国的文化科学水平，并推动和刺激我国的科学研究。世界各国的出版物那么多，我们当然不能一一翻译，必须有所选择。选什么呢？这就必须有一个原则。这个原则就是：一切翻译工作，都必须围绕着上述这一个根本目的而行，任何一册书一篇文章的翻译，都要或多或少地有助于上述任务的完成。这就必须是取人之有，补我之缺；取人之长，补我之短；取人之精，补我之粗；总之，要取法乎上。不这样，就可能造成人力物力上的浪费。具体地说就是要遵循下面的一些原则。首先，是选择那些具有先进科学水平和创造性的著作，那些在目前阶段属于该方面的最新的和最高的科学研究成果的著作。其次，是历史上留存下来的各民族优秀的文化成果，那些在人类进步过程中有重大影响的各个学派，特别是先进学派的重要著作和代表性著作。再次，是那些具有丰富的现代资料或者历史资料的著作。复次，就是平常我们所讲的我国科学工作中的缺门或者特别薄弱的部门。这类著作中的某些原著的水平虽不甚高，但是在我国却没有人认真研究过，也可以翻译。最后，就是在写作方法上可以作为范例或者可以作为参考之用的杰出的普通读物和通俗读物。一个国家的中级的和通俗的读物，特别是哲学、社会科学方面的这类读物，无论如何应该主要由自己的著作来解决，因为这类读物特别需要联系到本国的情况来写，才容易收到效果。
    这里，顺便谈谈繁荣著作与建立正确的翻译工作方针之间的关系的问题。我以为，为了提高翻译书的质量和推动出版机构去努力繁荣创作，出版管理机构有必要规定某些出版社的著作与翻译的比例，改变某些出版社所出的书中翻译书占了大部分或绝大部分的现状（某些专门出版翻译书的当然例外）。这样一来，某些出版社的全年出书种数可能暂时减少，那么就让它暂时减少也不要紧。又如，应该作出出版机构必须严肃地对待翻译书的规定，绝不允许出版社事先根本不了解原书的内容，就盲目地加以选译，译者也应该对原著的内容作深入的了解，并对出版社作负责的介绍，大家都弄清楚了有可译的价值之后才开始译。
    其次，要谈谈发掘潜在的翻译力量和翻译力量的组织问题。目前，我们还没有形成一个力量雄厚的翻译工作者的队伍。过去几年，不仅组织古典学术著作的翻译很困难，就是组织当前的篇幅较大的著作的翻译也很困难。如果照老办法作下去，要想完成长远翻译规划的任务，是很少有可能的。为了保证能够完成目前的和长远规划中的翻译工作，我觉得有下列的一些措施是可以而且应该逐渐采取的：一是各高等学校的教师和教研组可以把翻译某些古典学术、文艺著作，列入自己的研究计划之内。因为，要把这些书译得好，就必须读很多书，进行很多的研究工作，而这些书又首先是高等学校的师生们所需要的。因此，由高等学校的教师们来担负这个任务是必要的，不能把它看作是“不务正业”。二是要充分组织发挥散处在机关、学校、企业和社会上的翻译者的力量。他们中有一些人的语文水平和专业知识水平都是比较高的，由于没有组织，虽然他们与出版机构之间都有互相依赖的关系，却没有一个媒介把他们连结起来。因此，我们建议由有关部门和有关出版社经常地邀集翻译工作者举行座谈会，加强联系，并随时解决他们的各种困难问题。此外，古典学术著作与文学名著的翻译工作的报酬，应该适当的提高一些。这是一件很吃力的工作，对译稿的要求也比较严格，适当提高这类书的翻译稿酬是合理的。
    最后，要谈谈出版社对翻译稿件的处理问题。出版社的编辑人员习惯于将原稿对照原文逐字校订，但是编辑人力很有限，因此有些书译好后就只好放在编辑室睡觉。一年两年出不来，大大损伤了译者的积极性。人民出版社和三联书店等处长期以来就有这个毛病，现在也还没有完全克服。我以为，编辑没有替译者逐字校订全书的责任，把译稿弄得完美可读是译者和校者自己的事情，某些责任心不强的译者把希望寄托在编辑部三番五次的修改是不对的。编者的责任，是由自己并请教专家于事前充分了解译者的能力，并在翻译的过程中设法了解译稿的质量以定取舍。已经译成的稿件可以从阅读译文中作出大体的判断，并抽出一部分对照原文加以研究；然后提出一些比较重大的意见由译者考虑修改。如果译稿水平过低，主要依靠编辑多次校改才勉强可用，那是不够出版条件的，只能暂时据理退稿，而不能由编辑代替译者重译一遍。但是有些出版社却习惯于这样作，这是应该改正的。
    翻译工作正像从外国运来种籽种植到中国的土壤上使其发荣滋长一样，弄得好，就大大有助于中国文化科学水平的提高。这件工作的意义是十分重大的，不应该看不起这件工作，而应该赶快发展和改进这方面的工作。
