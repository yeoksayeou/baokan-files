Xinhua News Agency, November 5th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent identical notes to the British and French embassies on November 4th. The content of the notes is as follows:

    The Soviet government has already expressed its attitude towards the aggressive actions of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt. The Soviet government has now received information that the British and French naval commands have announced a blockade of merchant ship navigation in certain areas of the eastern Mediterranean and the northern Red Sea.

    These actions by Britain and France violate the universally recognized principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas and, in essence, signify that the British and French governments are implementing a maritime blockade of the coasts of Egypt and several other Mediterranean countries.

    The blockade of navigation in certain areas of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea makes the use of the Suez Canal impossible. In this way, Britain and France are clearly violating the 1888 Constantinople Convention regarding the Suez Canal. As everyone knows, according to Article 1 of this convention, the signatory countries (including Britain and France) shall not disrupt the free use of the canal, whether in times of war or peace. The convention stipulates that no right of blockade shall be exercised over the canal.

    The Soviet government believes that the aforementioned actions of Britain and France are aggressive actions that not only harm Egypt but also harm the interests of other countries. The Soviet government cannot ignore the illegal actions of Britain and France, especially since these actions were taken after the Emergency Session of the United Nations General Assembly advocated an immediate ceasefire, cessation of military operations, and the restoration of navigation on the Suez Canal.

    The Soviet government firmly protests this illegal action by Britain and France and declares that the British and French governments shall bear the responsibility for all possible consequences of this action.

    根据君士坦丁堡公约维护自由通航原则
    苏联抗议英法非法封锁苏伊士运河
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部11月4日给英国和法国大使馆同样照会各一份，照会内容如下：
    苏联政府已经表示了自己对英国、法国和以色列向埃及实行侵略行动的态度。苏联政府现在获得消息，英法海军指挥部宣布封锁地中海东部以及红海北部某些地区的商船航行。
    英法的这种行动是违反公认的公海上自由通航的原则的，而且实质上意味着英法政府对埃及及其他若干地中海国家的沿岸实行海洋封锁。
    封锁地中海和红海某些地区的航行使苏伊士运河的使用成为不可能，这样英法就明显地破坏了1888年关于苏伊士运河的君士坦丁堡公约。大家知道，根据这项公约第一条，条约国（其中也包括英国和法国）无论在战时和和平时期都不得破坏自由使用运河。公约指出，对运河绝对不能行使封锁权。
    苏联政府认为英法的上述行为不仅是损害埃及而且也是损害其他国家利益的侵略行动。苏联政府对英法的非法行动不能视而无睹，特别是因为这些行动是在联合国大会紧急会议主张立即停火、停止军事行动和恢复苏伊士运河通航以后采取的。
    苏联政府坚决抗议英法方面这种非法行动，同时声明，这种行动的一切可能发生的后果的责任都应由英法政府担负。
