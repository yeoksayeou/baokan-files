    Effective Steps Should Be Taken to Force the Aggressor Troops to Withdraw from Egypt

    On November 24th, the United Nations General Assembly passed the joint proposal of the Asian-African group of countries, once again demanding that the United Kingdom, France, and Israel abide by the United Nations resolutions and immediately withdraw their invading troops from Egyptian territory.

    More than twenty days have passed since the United Nations passed resolutions on November 1st and 7th demanding the withdrawal of troops by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel. However, the fact is that the United Kingdom, France, and Israel have no intention of implementing the United Nations resolutions at all. They create various unreasonable excuses and put forward various conditions in an attempt to refuse to implement the United Nations resolutions requiring them to withdraw their invading troops. Now, the United Nations General Assembly has passed a resolution for the third time to urge the United Kingdom, France, and Israel to withdraw their troops, which shows that the majority of member states in the United Nations are determined to stop aggression and maintain peace in the Middle East. However, after the United Nations makes a resolution, resolute and effective steps should also be taken to break all the excuses of the United Kingdom, France, and Israel for refusing to implement the United Nations resolutions, and to ensure that the invading troops of the United Kingdom, France, and Israel immediately withdraw from Egyptian territory. Because, as long as the invading troops of the United Kingdom, France, and Israel do not withdraw from Egypt for a single day, there will be no guarantee of peace in the Middle East, and war may break out again. Moreover, if the United Nations does not take effective steps to force the aggressors to implement the decisions of the General Assembly, it will also damage the credibility of the United Nations.

    At present, the main excuse for the United Kingdom and France to refuse to withdraw their invading troops from Egyptian territory is to ensure the so-called "clearing of the canal" and the establishment of the so-called "international control" of the canal. These pretexts, in addition to nakedly exposing the original intention of the United Kingdom and France colluding with Israel to launch a war of aggression against Egypt, are simply untenable. The withdrawal of all invading troops from Egyptian territory and the settlement of the Suez Canal issue are completely two different things. To solve the Suez Canal issue, to "clear the canal," all foreign invading troops must first be withdrawn from Egypt, and this is only possible on the basis of respecting Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal. The United Kingdom and France are delaying and refusing to implement the United Nations resolutions requiring them to withdraw their troops, and are attempting to use the United Nations Emergency Force to achieve the goals they did not achieve in launching the war of aggression. This will not work. Using any foreign troops to exert pressure on Egypt is a blatant violation of Egyptian sovereignty.

    The United Kingdom and France's collusion with Israel to not implement the United Nations resolutions requiring them to withdraw their troops will only prolong the war crisis in the Middle East, prevent the Suez Canal from being opened to navigation as soon as possible, and bring more serious consequences to their own domestic economy and people's lives. Since the United Kingdom and France cut off the Suez Canal, their domestic economic life has encountered great difficulties, especially the oil panic, which is threatening their industrial production and the daily lives of their people, thereby causing a domestic political crisis.

    Now there are various facts showing that the way for the United Kingdom and France to get rid of this difficult situation is not to withdraw troops from Egypt in accordance with the United Nations resolutions and to peacefully negotiate with Egypt to resolve the canal issue as soon as possible, but to attempt to create disputes within Arab countries and provoke new wars of aggression in the Middle East. They are now on the one hand instigating Israel to gather troops on the Syrian border, threatening Syria's security; on the other hand, they are instigating certain Baghdad Pact countries to use pressure on Syria, demanding that Syria change its current policy of maintaining independent sovereignty and cooperating with Egypt and other Arab countries in solidarity. Therefore, the United Nations should demand that the United Kingdom, France, and Israel immediately stop the emergency situation they have created on the Israeli-Syrian border, and immediately stop the threats and conspiracies they are carrying out against the Syrian government.

    The fact that the United Kingdom, France, and Israel dare to act wilfully in Egypt and the Middle East, regardless of the previous resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, is inseparable from the attitude of the United States. While voting in the United Nations General Assembly to support the resolution demanding the withdrawal of troops from Egypt by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel, the United States is also advocating confusing the Suez Canal issue with the troop withdrawal issue. This is actually encouraging the United Kingdom, France, and Israel to delay withdrawing troops from Egypt. US representative Lodge openly stated in the United Nations General Assembly that since the United Kingdom and France have announced their plans to withdraw part of their troops, the United Nations "does not need" to pass the Asian-African group of countries' proposal, which further exposes the US's intention.

    The withdrawal of a small portion of the invading troops of the United Kingdom, France, and Israel from Egypt is precisely the trick of the so-called "symbolic withdrawal" that they have long announced, the purpose of which is only to perfunctorily deal with the condemnation of the United Nations General Assembly and the world's just public opinion. World public opinion will never be fooled by the tricks played by the aggressors. As Egypt has repeatedly stated, the issue of restoring freedom of navigation in the canal cannot be discussed until the invading troops have completely withdrawn from Egyptian territory.

### 应该采取有效的步骤  迫使侵略军撤出埃及

    应该采取有效的步骤  迫使侵略军撤出埃及
    11月24日，联合国大会通过了亚非集团国家联合提案，再一次要求英、法和以色列三国遵守联合国决议，立即从埃及的领土上撤退它们的侵略军队。
    自从11月1日和7日联合国通过要求英、法和以色列撤军的决议以来，时间已过去了二十多天。但是，事实证明英、法和以色列根本没有打算执行联合国的决议，它们制造各种无理的借口，提出各种各样的条件，企图拒绝执行联合国要求它们撤退侵略军队的决议。现在，联合国大会第三次通过决议来督促英、法和以色列三国撤军，这表明联合国中的大多数会员国具有制止侵略、维护中东和平的决心。但是，在联合国作出决议之后，还应该采取坚决和有效的步骤，打破英、法和以色列拒不执行联合国决议的一切借口，保证英、法和以色列三国侵略军立即从埃及领土上撤退出去。因为，只要英、法和以色列侵略军一天不撤离埃及，中东和平就一天没有保障，战争就可能再起。而且，联合国不采取有效步骤迫使侵略者执行大会的决定，也有损于联合国的信誉。
    目前，英、法拒绝从埃及领土上撤退它们的侵略军队的主要借口是，要保证所谓“清理运河”和建立运河的所谓“国际管制”。这些托词，除了赤裸裸地暴露了英、法勾结以色列发动对埃及侵略战争的本意以外，是根本站不住脚的。从埃及领土上撤退一切侵略军队和解决苏伊士运河问题，完全是两回事。要解决苏伊士运河问题，要“清理运河”，首先必须从埃及撤退一切外国侵略军队，并在尊重埃及对苏伊士运河的主权的基础上才有可能。英、法拖延和拒绝执行联合国要它们撤军的决议，而又企图利用联合国紧急部队来达到它们在发动侵略战争中所没有达到的目的，这是行不通的。利用任何外国军队对埃及施加压力，都是对埃及主权的公然侵犯。
    英、法勾结以色列不执行联合国要求它们撤军的决议，只会使中东的战争危机延长，使苏伊士运河不能早日通航，并给它们自己的国内经济和人民生活带来更加严重的后果。自英、法切断苏伊士运河以来，它们国内的经济生活已经发生了很大的困难，特别是石油的恐慌，正威胁着它们的工业生产和人民的日常生活，从而引起了它们国内的政治危机。
    现在有种种事实表明，英、法摆脱这种困难处境的办法，不是要依照联合国的决议从埃及撤军，早日同埃及和平协商解决运河问题，而是企图在阿拉伯国家内部制造争端，在中东挑起新的侵略战争。它们现在正一方面唆使以色列向叙利亚边境集结军队，威胁叙利亚的安全；一方面又唆使某些巴格达集团国家对叙利亚使用压力，要叙利亚改变目前维护独立主权和同埃及等阿拉伯国家团结合作的政策。因此，联合国应当要求英、法和以色列立即制止它们在以色列—叙利亚边境造成的紧急状态，立即制止它们针对叙利亚政府所进行的威胁和阴谋活动。
    英、法和以色列敢于不顾联合国大会的历次决议，在埃及和中东地区为所欲为，这同美国的态度是分不开的。美国在联合国大会上投票支持要求英、法和以色列军队撤出埃及的决议的同时，却又主张把苏伊士运河问题同撤军问题混淆起来。这实际上是鼓励英、法和以色列拖延从埃及撤军。美国代表洛奇在联合国大会上公然认为英、法既已宣布撤退它们部分军队的计划，联合国就“没有必要”再通过亚非集团国家提案的说法，更暴露了美国的这种用心。
    英、法和以色列侵略军队从埃及撤退一小部分，正是它们早已宣布过的所谓“象征性撤军”的诡计，目的只是为了搪塞联合国大会和世界公正舆论的谴责。世界舆论绝不会上侵略者玩弄诡计的当。正如埃及所一再表示，侵略军队不完全撤出埃及领土，就谈不到恢复运河的航行自由问题。
