Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The 40th plenary session of the State Council was held on the morning of the 16th.

After hearing the explanation by Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu, the meeting adopted the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Nepal on Maintaining Friendly Relations and on Trade and Transportation between the Tibet Region of China and Nepal" and decided to submit this agreement to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review and approval.

The meeting approved the "Notice of the State Council on Halting the Establishment of New Agencies and Expansion of Staffing in State Organs," approved the "Decision of the State Council on Establishing the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Weishan Yi Autonomous County, Yongjian Hui Autonomous County, and Abolishing Weishan County in Yunnan Province," the "Decision of the State Council on Abolishing Tonghai and Hexi Counties and Establishing Qilu County in Yunnan Province," the "Decision of the State Council on Abolishing Anning County in Yunnan Province," the "Decision of the State Council on Establishing Nanping City in Fujian Province," the "Decision of the State Council on Establishing Pingxiang City in Guangxi Province," and the "Decision of the State Council on Establishing Shaobian Yao Autonomous County in Guangdong Province."

Finally, the meeting approved several personnel appointments and removals.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The State Council's notice regarding the cessation of establishing new organizations and expanding staffing in state organs is as follows:

Although the organizational structures and staffing levels of state organs at all levels have been streamlined several times, the phenomena of overlapping organizations and overstaffing remain very serious. This not only wastes a significant amount of human, material, and financial resources, but more importantly, it fosters the development of bureaucracy in the work of state organs. In order to streamline state organs, overcome bureaucracy, improve work efficiency, strengthen leadership in administrative and enterprise grassroots units, and ensure the correct implementation of various policies of the Party and the government, it is now decided that, from the date of arrival of this notice, state organs at all levels shall cease establishing new organizations and increasing personnel. Vacancies arising from external transfers or enrollment in schools by existing personnel will also no longer be filled. If individual units genuinely need to increase personnel, those under local administration should report to the provincial, autonomous region, or directly administered municipality people's committee for approval; those under the central level should report to the State Council for approval.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The State Council issued an instruction on November 14th, requiring all localities not to automatically raise the purchasing prices of state-purchased agricultural products and agricultural and sideline products uniformly purchased by state-owned commercial companies and supply and marketing cooperatives.

The instruction first pointed out that recently, some regions have automatically increased the purchasing prices of state-purchased and uniformly purchased agricultural and sideline products, failing to take into account overall balance, affecting the prices of agricultural and sideline products in neighboring regions, and also creating unreasonable price ratios between agricultural and sideline products. For this reason, the State Council specifically stipulates that for all state-purchased agricultural products and agricultural and sideline products uniformly purchased by state-owned commercial companies and supply and marketing cooperatives, whether in concentrated production areas or in dispersed production areas, in markets controlled by the central government or in markets controlled by provinces and counties, if the purchasing prices must be increased, opinions may be submitted to the State Council or the relevant departments under the State Council for research. Before approval is granted, all localities should not raise prices on their own, so as not to affect the overall price arrangements in other regions.

    国务院决定国家机关停止增设机构扩大编制
    指示各地不要自动提高统购和收购的农副产品价格
    新华社16日讯　国务院全体会议第四十次会议在16日上午举行。
    会议听了外交部副部长章汉夫的说明以后，通过了“中华人民共和国和尼泊尔王国保持友好关系以及关于中国西藏地方和尼泊尔之间的通商和交通的协定”，并且决定将这一协定提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会审核批准。
    会议通过了关于国家机关停止增设机构扩大编制的通知，通过了“国务院关于设置云南省大理白族自治州、巍山彝族自治县、永建回族自治县和撤销巍山县的决定”“国务院关于撤销云南省通海、河西两县和设置杞麓县的决定”“国务院关于撤销云南省安宁县的决定”“国务院关于设置福建省南平市的决定”“国务院关于设置广西省凭祥市的决定”和“国务院关于设置广东省韶边瑶族自治县的决定”。
    会议最后通过了任免事项多起。
    新华社16日讯　国务院关于国家机关停止增设机构扩大编制的通知如下：
    各级国家机关的机构编制，虽然曾进行过几次精简，但是机构重叠，人浮于事的现象仍很严重。这不仅浪费了大量的人力物力和财力，更重要的是助长了国家机关工作中官僚主义的发展。为了精简国家机关，克服官僚主义，提高工作效率，加强行政和事业企业基层单位的领导力量，保证正确地贯彻党和政府的各项政策，现决定自本通知到达之日起，各级国家机关，一律停止增设新的机构，增加人员，原有人员因外调或入学有了空额时也不再补充。个别单位如有确实需要增加的，属地方的应报省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会批准；属中央一级的应报国务院批准。
    新华社16日讯　国务院在11月14日发出指示，要求各地不得自动提高国家统购的农产品和委托国营商业公司、供销合作社统一收购的农副产品的收购价格。
    指示首先指出，最近以来，某些地区自动提高了国家统购的和统一收购的农副产品的收购价格，未能照顾全面的平衡，影响到毗邻地区农副产品的价格，同时也造成了农副产品之间比价不合理现象。为此，国务院特规定：凡属国家统购的农产品和委托国营商业公司和供销合作社统一收购的农副产品，无论在集中产区或在分散产区，在中央掌握的市场或在省、县掌握的市场，其收购价格如果必须提高，可向国务院或者国务院所属主管部门提出意见，进行研究，在未批准以前，各地不要自行提价，以免影响其他地区对价格的全面安排。
