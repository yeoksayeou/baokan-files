    Recent Developments in West Germany
    Xí Línshēng
    The recent developments in West Germany are noteworthy.
    The Adenauer government is intensifying its rearmament efforts, deepening the division of Germany. Since the West German Federal Parliament passed the conscription law, the government has begun registering young men of conscription age starting from October 15th, preparing to establish the officer corps for the first two divisions this November. The Ministry of Defense has also openly decided to recruit the most ferocious SS executioners from the Hitler era as the backbone of the West German army. West German arms industry will also officially begin producing various weapons. The Ministry of Defense is also drafting plans to produce atomic weapons in West Germany, and Adenauer himself has clamored that "the new West German army must ultimately be equipped with atomic weapons." It is clear that the West German government's intention with rearmament is to build an aggressive army equipped with atomic weapons, with Hitler's SS as its core, and they are trying their best to establish such an army before the general election to consolidate their position.
    However, the Adenauer government's plan is not easy to achieve. It has met with strong opposition from the people. Many West German youth organizations, including youth trade union workers, the West German Student Union, and the youth organizations of the West German Social Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party, have firmly opposed conscription. A large number of young people refuse to register for military service every day, and many are flocking to East Germany. The West German Trade Union Federation, the largest in West Germany with more than six million members, also called for opposition to conscription at its recent congress and supported all forces opposing conscription. Currently, the forces in West Germany opposing conscription are beginning to organize. The West German "International Association of Conscientious Objectors" already has forty-two local organizations with a large number of members. Another "Duisburg Peace Friends Commune" aimed at opposing conscription has also been formally established recently. All of this has greatly promoted the movement against conscription in West Germany. Recently, many local government officials, including mayors and town heads, have refused to carry out the West German government's work of registering young people of conscription age on the grounds of "conscientious objection to military service," causing the registration of conscription-age youth to stall in Dortmund, Lünen, Wilhelmshaven and other places. The West German bourgeois newspaper "Welt am Sonntag" acknowledged that a new anti-militaristic wave is sweeping West Germany.
    Faced with this strong opposition from the people, the West German government has had to make some concessions on the surface, shortening the original eighteen-month conscription period to twelve months. This decision has caused panic and unease in the United States and the NATO countries.
    At the same time, the West German government, considering that the issue of peaceful reunification will become a "major issue" in next year's general election (Reuters), is trying to shift the blame for the failure to resolve the German reunification issue onto the Soviet Union in order to divert people's attention. In its note to the Soviet Union on September 7th, it falsely accused the Soviet Union of obstructing German reunification. The United States, Britain, and France also sent similar notes to the Soviet Union on October 10th, coordinating with the West German government's actions. They did not put forward any suggestions that would help promote German reunification in the notes, but only repeated the old plan of annexing East Germany through so-called "free elections," which had long been unworkable. Recently, Adenauer and West German Defense Minister Strauss have also taken advantage of the Hungarian incident to slander the Soviet Union, attempting to stir up a "cold war" against the Soviet Union to suppress the calls within West Germany for improved relations with the Soviet Union.
    However, the Soviet Union's consistent attitude of supporting the restoration of German unity cannot be distorted. In its reply to West Germany, the Soviet Union reiterated this position: Since there are currently two states in Germany, the only realistic way to unify Germany is to have negotiations between the two Germanies. This proposition is the only practical and feasible one, and it has been widely supported by the German people. The German Democratic Republic has repeatedly put forward suggestions for the two German governments to strengthen cooperation and hold negotiations. The reaction of the West German public is also becoming increasingly strong.
    The West German Free Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, and people from all walks of life have generally expressed dissatisfaction with the West German government's note to the Soviet Union. The chairman of the Free Democratic Party, Dehler, recently said, "We cannot allow the Federal Government to refuse peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union." The broad masses of people in West Germany believe that promoting friendly relations with the Soviet Union is conducive to realizing the desire for reunification, and they are constantly taking further actions to strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Parties and parliamentary groups in the Federal Parliament, including some members of the Christian Democratic Union, accepted the invitation to visit the Soviet Union despite the opposition of the Adenauer government and decided to send a delegation to visit the Soviet Union. The West German Senate accepted the same invitation.
    What is even more noteworthy is that the proposition of promoting the resolution of the German issue through consultation and cooperation between the two Germanies has been accepted by more and more people in West Germany. Saarland Parliament Speaker Schneider recently called for direct negotiations between the people of East and West Germany and advocated that a "Pan-German Committee" composed of representatives from East and West Germany be the first step. The Seventh All-German Christian Congress held in West Germany in August, attended by more than 50,000 East and West German Christians, also called for understanding between the two Germanies. Among those attending the conference were the Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Dieckmann, Deputy Prime Minister Nuschke, West German President Heuss, and Federal Parliament Speaker Gerstenmaier. At the same time, the Pan-German Bloc, the opposition party in the West German parliament, recently advocated that the West German government hold negotiations with the leaders of the German Democratic Republic. What is even more noteworthy is that the West German Free Democratic Party recently held talks with the East German Free Democratic Party on the issue of German reunification and reached an agreement to support open exchange of views between the two parts of Germany on the domestic conditions for reunification. This powerfully refutes the lies of Western countries that cooperation between the two parts of Germany is impossible due to the ideological opposition between East and West Germany.
    Another noteworthy development in the West German situation is the recent proposal by Adenauer to organize a "European Federation." Adenauer's proposal is closely linked to the West German government's domestic and foreign policies. The development of West Germany's economic strength in the past year has made West Germany a powerful competitor in the capitalist world market. West Germany's automobile exports have surpassed those of Britain and the United States to rank first, ship exports have also surpassed Britain, and steel, pig iron production, and chemical exports have also surpassed Britain to rank second. West Germany's trade with several major countries in Western Europe has surpassed that of Britain and the United States to rank first, and in Latin America, West Germany has surpassed Britain to rank second. West German forces have also powerfully penetrated Britain's traditional markets. Now that West Germany is attempting to organize a "European Federation," it is seeking to further gain a dominant position in the politics and economy of Western Europe to facilitate its political and economic expansion.
    However, West Germany's demand for external expansion inevitably deepens the contradictions between West Germany and capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France. In particular, due to the increasing economic strength of West Germany, West German monopoly capital, on the one hand, needs to rely on the United States to enhance its position in Western Europe, and on the other hand, it is also trying to get rid of the shackles of the United States. In fact, the "European Federation" advocated by West Germany, like the plan proposed by Britain to establish a "Western European Free Trade Area" and a "third force," reflects the growing trend of anti-Americanism in Western Europe. Adenauer himself admitted that his proposed "European Federation" plan is "related to the resentment and disappointment" felt by Britain and France towards American policy and is intended to counter the "huge pressure" from the United States. He said: "The vital needs of European countries and the vital needs of the United States are not always the same."
    However, the West German government's policy of insisting on reviving militarism has increasingly isolated and destabilized its domestic situation. Following the Pan-German Bloc, the Free Democratic Party has also completely withdrawn from the government coalition, and recently the ministers of the Free People's Party have also disagreed with Adenauer and offered their resignations. Within Adenauer's own Christian Democratic Union, forces opposing Adenauer are also on the rise. The influence of the Social Democratic Party, the largest opposition party to the Adenauer government, is increasing. In the municipal elections held in the five major states of North Rhine-Westphalia in West Germany on October 28th and November 11th, the Social Democratic Party received significantly more votes than the Christian Democratic Union. Now all opposition forces are brewing to organize a joint force to overthrow the Adenauer government. Many Western newspapers and periodicals are also predicting the danger that Adenauer may collapse in next year's general election. "The New York Times" said: "Next year's German general election may produce a fundamentally changed situation," and it called on the United States to prepare to improve relations between the United States and the West German Social Democratic Party in order to "face unpleasant realities." All of this shows that the reactionary policies pursued by the Adenauer government are unrealistic and full of crises.

    最近西德的局势
    席林生
    最近西德局势的发展，值得注意。
    阿登纳政府正在加紧重新武装，加深德国的分裂。自从西德联邦议会通过征兵法后，政府从10月15日起开始登记兵役适龄青年，准备在今年11月建立起头两个师的军官团。国防部还公然决定召募希特勒时代最凶恶的刽子手党卫军作为西德军队的骨干。西德的军火工业也将正式开始生产各种武器。国防部还正在拟订在西德生产原子武器的计划，阿登纳自己也叫嚷“西德新军最后必须用原子武器装备起来”。很明显，西德政府心目中的重新武装是要建立一支以希特勒党卫军为主的配备原子武器的侵略性军队，并且他们竭力想在大选之前把这样一支军队建立起来，以巩固他们的地位。
    但是，阿登纳政府的这种打算并不是容易达到的。它遭到了人民的强烈的反对。西德许多青年组织，包括青年工会工作者、西德学生联合会以及西德社会民主党、自由民主党等的青年组织都坚决反对征兵。每天大批的青年拒绝兵役登记，有许多青年在纷纷投奔民主德国。西德最大的拥有六百多万会员的工会联合会在不久前召开的代表大会上也号召反对征兵，支持一切反对征兵的力量。目前，西德反对征兵的力量开始组织起来。西德“反对服兵役者国际协会”已经有了四十二个地方组织，拥有大批会员。另一个以反对征兵为宗旨的“杜伊斯堡和平之友公社”也在最近正式成立起来。这都大大地推动了西德反对征兵的运动。最近，许多包括市长镇长的地方政府当局的官员纷纷以“从良心上反对服兵役”为理由而拒绝执行西德政府的登记适龄青年的工作，致使在多特蒙德、吕嫩、威廉港等地的登记兵役青年的工作停顿下来。西德资产阶级报纸“星期日世界报”承认，一个新的反军国主义浪潮正在席卷西德。
    面对着人民的这种强烈的反对，西德政府不得不在表面上作出一些让步，把原来所坚持的十八个月的兵役期限缩短为十二个月。这个决定引起了美国和北大西洋集团国家的恐慌和不安。
    同时西德政府考虑到和平统一问题将成为明年大选中一个“最主要的问题”（路透社），因此，为了转移人们的视线，竟然想把德国统一问题不能解决的责任推在苏联身上。在它9月7日给苏联的照会中，诬赖苏联阻挠德国统一。美、英、法三国也在10月10日向苏联发出了同样的照会，策应西德政府的行动。它们在照会中丝毫没有提出任何有助于促进德国重新统一的建议，而只是重复早就行不通的所谓经由“自由选举”吞并民主德国的老方案。而最近，阿登纳和西德国防部长斯特劳斯又借匈牙利事件大肆污蔑苏联，企图煽起对苏联的“冷战”，来压制西德内部要求改善和苏联关系的呼声。
    但是苏联一贯支持恢复德国统一的态度是不容歪曲的。苏联在给西德的复照中重申这个主张：由于目前在德国存在着两个国家，因而统一德国的唯一现实的道路就是两个德国之间进行谈判。这个主张是唯一切实可行的，已经得到了德国人民的普遍支持。德意志民主共和国无数次地提出了两个德国政府加强合作和进行谈判的建议。西德公众的反应也越来越强烈。
    西德自由民主党、社会民主党等和各阶层人士对西德政府给苏联的照会，普遍表示不满。自由民主党主席戴勒在最近说，“我们不能容许联邦政府拒绝同苏联和平共处。”西德广大阶层人士认为促进同苏联的友好关系，有利于实现统一的愿望，并不断地采取更进一步的行动来争取祖国的和平统一。联邦议会中各党派、议会党团，包括基督教民主联盟一些成员在内，不顾阿登纳政府的反对，接受了访苏的邀请，决定派代表团访问苏联。西德参议院接受了同样的邀请。
    更值得注意的是，要求通过两个德国之间的协商和合作来促进解决德国问题的主张，已经为越来越多的西德人士所接受。萨尔议会议长施奈德最近要求东德和西德人民进行直接谈判，并主张由东西德的代表组成“全德委员会”作为第一个步骤。8月份在西德举行的有五万多东、西德基督教徒参加的第七届全德基督教代表大会也呼吁两个德国之间求得谅解。参加这个大会的有民主德国人民议院主席狄克曼、副总理努舍克和西德总统豪斯、联邦议会主席格斯登美尔等。同时西德在议会中的反对党全德集团最近也主张西德政府同民主德国的领导人举行谈判。更引起注意的是，不久前西德自由民主党同东德自由民主党就德国统一问题举行了会谈，并达成协议，决定支持德国两部分之间就统一的国内条件进行公开的意见交换。这都有力地驳斥了西方国家所谓由于东、西德之间意识形态的对立而不可能使德国两部分进行合作的谎言。
    西德局势另一个值得注意的发展是，最近阿登纳提出组织“欧洲联邦”的计划。阿登纳提出这个计划是和西德政府的国内外政策有着密切的联系的。最近一年来西德的经济实力的发展，已使西德成为资本主义世界市场的强有力的竞争者。西德的小汽车输出已经超过英美而占第一位，船只的输出也超过英国，钢和生铁的生产以及化学品的输出也已超过英国而居第二位。西德对西欧的几个主要国家贸易已超过英美而占第一位，在拉丁美洲西德也超过英国而居第二位，西德势力还有力地渗入英国的传统的市场。现在西德企图组织“欧洲联邦”，是想进一步在西欧的政治和经济中取得支配地位，以便利它的政治和经济的扩张。
    但是西德的这种对外扩张的要求，不可避免地加深了西德和美、英、法等资本主义国家之间的矛盾。特别是由于西德经济力量日益增强，西德垄断资本一方面须要依靠美国来增强它在西欧的地位，另一方面也在力图摆脱美国对它的束缚。事实上西德鼓吹的“欧洲联邦”，同英国提出的成立“西欧自由贸易区”和“第三种势力”的计划一样，正是反映了西欧正在发展中的对抗美国的趋势。阿登纳自己就承认，他提出的“欧洲联邦”计划，是同英法对美国政策所感到的“怨懑和失望是有一定的关系的”，是为了对付美国的“巨大压力”的。他说：“欧洲国家的切身需要和美国的切身需要并不总是一致的”。
    但是，西德政府坚持复活军国主义的政策，已使它在国内的处境日益陷于孤立和不稳定。继全德集团之后，自由民主党也完全退出了政府联盟，而最近自由人民党的部长也和阿登纳发生分歧而提出辞职。就在阿登纳自己的基督教民主联盟内部，反对阿登纳的势力也在抬头。阿登纳政府的最大反对党——社会民主党的影响正在提高，在10月28日和11月11日西德北莱因—威斯特伐利亚等五大州举行的市政选举中，社会民主党得到的票数都大大超过基督教民主联盟。现在所有反对派力量都在酝酿组织联合力量，争取推翻阿登纳政府。许多西方国家报刊也在纷纷预测阿登纳在明年大选中有可能垮台的危险。“纽约时报”说：“明年的德国大选可能产生一个根本改观的局势”，它并要求美国准备改善美国和西德社会民主党的关系，以便“面对不愉快的现实”。这一切表明，阿登纳政府所执行的反动政策，是不现实的，充满危机的。
