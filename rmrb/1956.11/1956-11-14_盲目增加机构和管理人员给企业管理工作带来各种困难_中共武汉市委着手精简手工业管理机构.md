Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 12th November (Reporter Tao Jin Yan): The administrative management organizations of the handicraft industry system in Wuhan are complex and overlapping, and the personnel are dispersed, which has brought many obstacles to the work and increased the economic burden on grassroots cooperatives.

According to investigations, the current handicraft industry system in Wuhan, from the Municipal Federation to the Municipal and District Professional Federations, plus suburban offices, etc., has a total of ninety-two management organizations with one thousand one hundred and thirty-nine cadres. Compared with the high tide of handicraft cooperation, both the number of institutions and personnel have increased more than twofold. Among the handicraft cadres the reporter contacted, none did not complain about the artificial work obstacles caused by excessive institutional layers.

The bloated and overlapping institutions greatly affect the depth of work. Cadres of cooperatives, especially business cadres of some larger professional federations, are often surrounded by meetings, documents, and reports, and do not have enough time to go deep into grassroots societies to understand the situation. Some cooperatives in the Hanyang District, after being organized this year, have not yet seen cadres from the District Professional Federation visit them. The directors of grassroots societies are busy attending meetings, processing documents, and reporting at each level. In the past, the ten-day report to the Municipal Federation could be delivered in no more than three days, but now it generally takes ten days to transfer. An application report from the Second Chalk Production Group of Jiang'an District was passed up and down a total of eight times, circulating for more than four months, but the problem has still not been resolved.

Complex institutions and excessive management personnel have resulted in huge administrative expenses. In the first half of this year, the administrative expenses of the city's handicraft industry system were 325,000 yuan. In the second half of the year, due to the gradual completion of personnel allocation at all levels of institutions, the budget suddenly increased to 722,000 yuan, a large portion of which was wages for staff. This increases the burden of administrative expenses paid by grassroots societies.

Recently, at the handicraft industry political work conference convened by the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CPC, directors and cadres of federations at all levels exposed the shortcomings of the current complex organizational structure and demanded adjustments. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CPC has decided to abolish the municipal and district-level professional federations, establish district federations with several functional and professional sections, and reduce more than 400 staff members while streamlining the institutions.

    盲目增加机构和管理人员给企业管理工作带来各种困难
    中共武汉市委着手精简手工业管理机构
    新华社武汉12日电　新华社记者陶锦琰报道：武汉市手工业系统行政管理机构庞杂重叠，人员分散，给工作带来了许多妨碍，同时加重了基层合作社的经济负担。
    据调查，目前武汉市手工业系统，从市联合社到市、区专业联合社，加上郊区办事处等等，共有九十二个管理机构，拥有干部一千一百三十九人。同手工业合作化高潮以前比较，机构和人员都增加两倍以上。记者在接触到的部分手工业干部中，没有一个不抱怨机构层次过多所造成的人为的工作障碍。
    机构臃肿重叠，在很大程度上影响着工作不能深入。合作社的干部，特别是一些行业较大的专业联合社的业务干部，经常被会议、文件、报表等所围困，没有足够的时间深入到基层社去了解情况。汉阳区有些合作社今年组织起来后，还没看见区专业联合社的干部去过。基层社的主任忙于开会、处理文件和层层汇报。过去上达市联合社的旬报表不超过三天就可以送到，现在一般要经过十天才能转到。江岸区第二粉笔生产小组的一项申请报告，上传下达共八次，周转了四个多月，问题仍旧没有解决。
    机构庞杂和管理人员过多，造成行政开支浩大。今年上半年全市手工业系统的行政费用是三十二万五千元，下半年由于各级机构人员陆续配备齐全，预算骤然增加到七十二万二千元，其中很大一部分是工作人员的工资支出。这样基层社上缴行政费用的负担就加重了。
    最近，在中共武汉市委员会召开的手工业政治工作会议上，各级联合社主任和干部揭露了目前组织机构庞杂的缺点，要求加以调整。中共武汉市委员会已经决定撤消市、区级专业联合社，建立区联合社，下设若干职能科和专业科，在精简机构同时，还将减少工作人员四百多人。
