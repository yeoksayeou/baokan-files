    Agricultural Cooperatives Should Not Blindly Engage in Commerce

    Recently, in Shandong Province, a trend of agricultural production cooperatives engaging in commerce has greatly increased. Let's look at a few examples: The Yin Haiming Agricultural Cooperative in Jiaoyue District, Jiaoxian County, opened a restaurant at the market, and also set up stalls to retail over forty kinds of goods such as various dried and fresh aquatic products, small general merchandise, and vermicelli. They even used more than ten handcarts to transport and sell eggs and industrial products. The Xinxingji Agricultural Cooperative in Heze County sold dry tobacco, soy sauce, and vinegar in the market town, and also opened hotels and restaurants, which forced the supply and marketing cooperative's cooperative restaurant to close. The Duanzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in the Third District of Heze County did not hand over the grain that should have been purchased by the state in the summer, but now it has taken out 30,000 jin of wheat to open a restaurant.

    The restaurant opened by the Yan Shikuo Village Agricultural Cooperative in Juancheng County has been selling steamed buns, dumplings, noodles, sesame cakes, etc. for more than a month. Some agricultural cooperatives even took the opportunity to purchase and transport goods for resale. For example, individual cadres of the He Township Agricultural Cooperative in Liangtang, Guanxian County, purchased more than 2,500 jin of soybean cake from the state in the name of the agricultural cooperative and transported it to Huangchengji for sale, earning a commercial profit of more than one hundred yuan.

    Why do agricultural cooperatives want to engage in commerce? The reason is that sideline production decreased in the first half of the year, and the county and district leaders only called for increasing the income of cooperative members, but lacked specific leadership and arrangements. The agricultural cooperatives did not clearly define the boundaries between sideline production and commerce, and engaged in whatever made more money.

    The serious problem is that some county and district party committees still believe that "it doesn't matter to engage in a little commerce to increase the income of cooperative members," and not only do they fail to stop it in time, but they even support it. For example, the Jing Mountain District Committee of Jiaoxian County insisted that the supply and marketing cooperative transfer the restaurant to the Shiqiao Agricultural Cooperative to operate. The Shimen District Supply and Marketing Cooperative transferred the slaughtering team to the agricultural cooperative according to the decision of the district committee. The Agricultural Cooperative of Dingtao County bought sewing machines to make and sell clothing and hats, but did not have cloth coupons. The county party committee asked the Bureau of Commerce to approve the cloth coupons (the Bureau of Commerce did not agree). In this way, the tendency of agricultural cooperatives to develop commerce has been further fueled to a great extent.

    As a result of agricultural production cooperatives engaging in commerce, normal agricultural and sideline production has suffered undue losses. For example, the Chengguan Lighthouse Agricultural Cooperative in Laiyang County opened restaurants and hotels and was busy operating commerce, relaxing agricultural production. In some fields, weeds were taller than the corn, and only fifty jin of corn were harvested per mu.

    Agricultural cooperatives engaging in commercial activities not only affects the development of diverse rural sideline production and winter agricultural production, but also brings some chaos to the rural market, directly affecting the completion of the current national procurement plan. Since many agricultural cooperatives sell pasta, black market activities for grain are constantly occurring in some rural markets. For example, the market price of wheat in Heze is 70% higher per jin than the listed price. Many agricultural cooperatives in Zheng Baotun District, Xiajin County, grind sesame oil themselves for sale, and the price of 1.2 yuan per jin is actually twice as high as the price of the supply and marketing cooperative. Because the commercial activities of agricultural cooperatives compete with the canteens of local supply and marketing cooperatives, many organized peddlers and canteens have encountered difficulties such as small operating volume and high expenses. This year, Heze Prefecture planted 150,000 mu of sesame. Because agricultural cooperatives have successively requested the refund of state pre-purchase deposits, the state has only purchased 9.09% of the original contract amount. The same is true for other cottonseed, etc. Many agricultural cooperatives are willing to keep it for their own processing and not sell it to the state.

    Opening up the free market will greatly activate some farmer trade, which is very inevitable. However, it is necessary to distinguish between farmers' self-production and self-sales and purely commercial activities such as engaging in transportation and opening restaurants. Xiang Cun, Huang Zeming

    At present, in the Shangqiu area of Henan, many agricultural cooperatives are engaging in trafficking and reselling commerce and food service in order to develop diversified operations. The Fengshou Agricultural Cooperative in Huiyang Command Camp extracted more than 30 people and more than 1,000 yuan of funds to set up seven stalls to sell candy, cigarettes and meals, etc. The Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Xiayi County resold socks, towels, and miscellaneous general merchandise; the Second District Agricultural Cooperative in Suixian County pulled all the people engaged in the catering industry into the agricultural cooperative, and treated their catering industry as a sideline of the cooperative; the Houlou Agricultural Cooperative in Xiayi County also purchased livestock and slaughtered them for sale. In these areas, not only does it make it difficult for supply and marketing cooperatives to arrange private merchants, but it also affects the income of peddlers to varying degrees. Ma Qingsheng, a tobacco vendor in the Eighth District of Luyi County, had a turnover of 1,170 yuan in August. Since the Jiatun Agricultural Cooperative set up a tobacco stall next to Ma Qingsheng, he only did 836 yuan of business in September. According to the understanding of Xiangcheng County, in areas where agricultural cooperatives operate the same commodities as peddlers, the income of peddlers is half less than that of peddlers in other areas. In addition, some problems have also arisen in the management of the market. The market price of oil cakes in the Willow River Market of Ningling County is 2.2 jiao per jin, while the agricultural cooperative sells it for 4 jiao per jin; Liang Boren, a member of the Chenji Agricultural Cooperative in Yongcheng County, slaughtered sheep for sale. When Fan Yongqing, a cadre of the supply and marketing cooperative, went to stop him, Liang Boren threatened to kill Fan Yongqing with a knife. When these problems occurred, the local relevant departments actually said, "More cars do not hinder the road, and more boats do not hinder the port," and did not stop them. A state-owned grain store cadre was beaten for going to stop an agricultural cooperative operating a restaurant in Huaiyang County.

    Some agricultural cooperatives in Gansu Province have blindly engaged in commerce. More than 20 cooperative members of the Daqiao, Hejiaba and other agricultural cooperatives in Xihe County went to Datan and Baihe in Li County to sell cloth, small general merchandise, cigarettes, and salt. Some farmers near towns in Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous County, Gangu, Tianshui, Li County and other places opened hotels, sold steamed buns, and sold meals in towns, causing the catering industry in towns to increase blindly. The Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Ershilipu, Tianshui County, in addition to raising its own pigs for slaughter and sale, also purchased pigs nearby to sell meat. The Chengguan District of Xihe County recently added 78 commercial households, of which 54 were agricultural cooperative members. At the material exchange meeting in Luomen Town, Wushan County, it was found that many of the tea merchants were farmers. These farmers took local specialties to Xi'an, Baoji, Lanzhou and other places to sell, and when they returned, they bought tea and other items to sell in small towns in order to make huge profits. The Longquanlong Agricultural Cooperative in Pan'an Town, Gangu County, set up a restaurant in Jiajiazhuang and sold steamed buns and tofu. Two of the three small merchants in the town have had their business squeezed out. Tie Fu

    农业社不应该盲目经营商业
    近来，山东省有些农业生产合作社经营商业之风大起。举几个例子吧：胶县贾悦区尹海明农业社在集市开设一个菜馆，还摆摊零售各种干鲜水产、小百货、粉条等四十多种商品，并且用十多辆手推车贩运鸡蛋和工业品出卖；菏泽县新兴集农业社在集镇上出售旱烟、酱油和醋，还开设旅馆、饭馆，因而供销社的合作饭店被迫停业。菏泽县三区段庄农业社夏季应征购的粮食没有交给国家，现在却拿出三万斤小麦开起饭馆来了。
    鄄城县阎什口村农业社开的饭店，经营馍馍、包子、面条、烧饼等已有一个多月了。有的农业社更趁机套购和贩运。如冠县梁堂乡合乡村农业社个别干部，以农业社名义向国家购买豆饼二千五百余斤后，运至皇城集出售，从中获取商业利润百余元。
    为什么农业社要经营商业呢？原来是上半年副业生产减少了，县区领导只叫增加社员收入，又缺乏具体领导和安排，农业社对经营副业和商业的界线划分不清，什么赚钱多就经营什么。
    严重的问题是，有的县区党委还认为“增加社员收入，搞一点商业不要紧”，不仅不及时加以制止，甚至还给予支持。如胶县荆山区委一定要供销社把饭店移交给石桥农业社经营；石门区供销社根据区委的决定，把屠宰组交给农业社了；定陶县农业社买缝纫机做成衣、帽子卖，没有布票，县委就让商业局批给布票（商业局未同意）。这样，在很大程度上更助长了农业社发展商业的倾向。
    农业生产合作社经营商业的结果，已使正常的农副业生产遭到了不应有的损失。如莱阳县城关灯塔农业社开设饭馆、旅馆，忙于经营商业，放松了农业生产，有些田里野草比玉米长得高，一亩地只打五十斤玉米。
    农业社从事商业性质的活动，不仅影响农村多种多样副业生产的开展和冬季的农业生产，而且带来了农村市场的某些混乱，直接影响当前国家采购计划的完成。由于农业社卖面食的很多，有些农村市场不断发生粮食的黑市活动，如菏泽小麦每斤市价高于牌价70％。夏津县郑保屯区不少农业社自己用芝麻磨香油卖，每斤卖价一元二角竟比供销社售价高一倍。因为农业社的商业活动和当地供销社的食堂等进行竞争，使不少组织起来的商贩和食堂遇到经营额小、开支大等困难。菏泽全区今年种植芝麻十五万亩，由于农业社纷纷要求退还国家预购定金，至今国家只收购起原有合同数的9.09％；其他棉籽等也是如此，许多农业社愿留作自己加工，不卖给国家。
    开放自由市场，有些农民贸易将大大活跃起来，这是很必然的。但必须把农民自产自销与从事贩运和开饭铺等纯商业活动的界限区别开。　向村、黄泽民
    现在河南商丘地区有不少农业社为了开展多种经营，竟去从事贩卖性的商业和饭食等活动。淮阳指挥营丰收农业社抽出三十余人、一千多元资金，设立了七个摊子，卖糖、纸烟和饭食等；夏邑县五星农业社贩卖袜子、毛巾以及零星百货等商品；睢县二区农业社把所有经营饮食业的人都拉到农业社里，把他们经营的饮食业作为社的副业经营；夏邑县候楼农业社还购买牲畜自行宰杀去卖。在这些地区不仅使供销社安排私商感到困难，同时也程度不同地影响了商贩的收入。鹿邑县八区烟贩马庆生8月份经营额达一千一百七十元，自从贾摊农业社在马庆生旁边设立一个烟摊以后，9月份只做了八百三十六元的生意。据项城县了解凡农业社与商贩经营同等商品的地区，商贩收入要低于其他地区商贩收入的一半。另外，在市场的管理上也出现了一些问题，宁陵县柳河集油馍的市价是二角二分一斤，而农业社就卖到四角一斤；永城县陈集农业社社员梁伯仁杀羊贩卖，供销社干部范永清前去制止，梁伯仁就掂着刀要杀范永清。淮阳县有个农业社经营饭食，国营粮店的干部去制止，竟被打了一顿。当这些问题发生时，当地有关部门竟说“车多不碍路、船多不碍港，”而不去制止。
                吕振铎、叶茂春
    甘肃省有些农业社有盲目经营商业的情况，西和县大桥、何家坝等农业社，曾有二十多个社员到礼县大滩、白河等地卖布匹、小百货、纸烟、食盐等。张家川回族自治县、甘谷、天水、礼县等地城镇附近的一些农民，到镇上开旅店，卖馍，卖饭，使城镇饮食业盲目增加。天水县二十里铺东方红农业社，除自养生猪自宰、自销外，还在附近收购生猪卖肉。西和县城关区最近又增加商业户七十八户，其中有农业社员五十四户。武山县洛门镇物资交流会上，发现茶叶客商中有不少是农民。这些农民把土特产品拿到西安、宝鸡、兰州等地去卖，回来时买茶叶等物到小镇上出售，以牟取暴利。甘谷县盘安镇龙泉龙农业社在贾家庄设立饭馆，并有馒头、豆腐出售，镇上三户小商贩已有二户的营业被挤垮。　铁夫
