Increased Rapeseed Purchase Prices and Fertilizer Supply
Sichuan Farmers Expand Rapeseed Planting Area

(Our Chengdu dispatch) Sichuan Province farmers are actively expanding the rapeseed planting area. The province will sow 5.8 million mu of rapeseed this year, an increase of more than 6% over last year. In order to increase farmers' enthusiasm for rapeseed production, the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee, in accordance with the State Council's instruction to "increase the purchase price of rapeseed," announced a decision to increase the purchase price of rapeseed by 25% and organized cadres to widely publicize this to farmers, dispelling the concerns of some farmers that planting rapeseed would not be worthwhile. At the same time, relevant provincial departments also supplied 2,000 tons of oil cake, 588 tons of phosphate rock powder, and 10,000 tons of ammonium sulfate to help farmers solve the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer. Some places also helped farmers solve the problems of improved varieties and rapeseed planting techniques. The Luzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office transferred more than 13,500 jin of improved varieties from Luxian County to support farmers in Fushun, Longchang, Hejiang, Gulin, and Gusong counties. Now, in the major rapeseed producing area of the western Sichuan Plain, most of the more than 1.26 million mu of rapeseed has been sown, and the rapeseed seedlings transplanted are already growing tender green leaves. In order to increase the yield per unit area of rapeseed, farmers in various places have also paid attention to improving farming techniques. The area for improved varieties has generally been expanded compared with last year. About 40% of the more than 1.2 million mu of rapeseed planted on the western Sichuan Plain are selected "Victory Rapeseed" improved varieties. In Jinxi District, Peng'an County, "Victory Rapeseed" accounts for more than 90% of the more than 8,600 mu of rapeseed planted. Half of the rapeseed in Bishan District, Pingchang County, is strip-planted. (Zhi Dong)

    提高油菜籽收购价格和供应肥料
    四川农民扩大油菜播种面积
    本报成都电　四川省农民积极扩大油菜播种面积，全省今年将播种油菜五百八十万亩，比去年扩大6％多。为了提高农民油菜生产积极性，四川省人民委员会根据国务院“提高油菜籽的收购价格”的指示，公布了将油菜籽收购价格提高25％的决定，并组织干部广泛向农民进行了宣传，解除了部分农民怕种油菜划不来的顾虑，同时，省级有关部门，还供应了油枯二千吨，磷矿粉五百八十八吨，硫酸錏一万吨，帮助农民解决了肥料不足的困难。有的地方还帮助农民解决了良种和种油菜的技术问题。泸州专署就从泸县调剂出了良种一万三千五百多斤，支援富顺、隆昌、合江、古蔺、古宋等县农民。现在油菜主要产区的川西平原，一百二十六万多亩油菜，大部已经播完，育苗移栽的油菜，已长出嫩绿的叶片。为提高油菜单位面积产量，各地农民还注意了改进耕作技术。良种推广面积，一般都比去年扩大了，川西平原种的一百二十多万亩油菜，有40％左右是选用的“胜利油菜”良种。蓬安县金溪区种的八千六百多亩油菜，“胜利油菜”占90％以上。平昌县笔山区的油菜，有半数实行了条播。　　　（治东）
