Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 22nd: In major industrial cities such as Nanjing, Wuxi, Xuzhou and Changzhou in Jiangsu Province, more than 80% of the staff in factories and mines are now participating in socialist competitions.

Many departments in factories and mines have begun to focus on production and solve key production problems. After the departments of Nantong Dasheng Textile Auxiliary Factory strengthened cooperation between departments and between departments and workshops, they solved the long-standing problem of uneven yarn count. For a period of time, the parts of the double-wheeled double-shared plow in Xuzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory had quality problems. The factory's inspection department, with the cooperation of relevant departments, conducted an inspection and found that most of the parts that did not fully meet the specifications were related to the technological regulations. The technical department responsible for technological regulations held a forum for workshop technicians to study and use methods such as consultation to find problems and formulate improvement measures. The technical personnel of each workshop and department listed the measures and plans as personal competition conditions. In this way, the technological regulations were successfully implemented, and the problem of non-conforming parts was solved.

Through socialist competitions, department personnel have also begun to learn how to use the mass line method of work, improve their work, and improve the level of enterprise management. For example, the process department and technical inspection department of Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, in view of the situation of many defective products, many reworkings, and low quality in production, organized sixteen process and inspection personnel to go deep into the workshop to study and formulate process standards and technical standards, so that workers can more clearly understand the quality standards of products and their own responsibilities.

    江苏省各厂矿
    广泛展开科室竞赛
    据新华社南京22日电　江苏省南京、无锡、徐州和常州等主要工业城市各厂矿，目前有80％以上的科室人员参加了社会主义竞赛。
    各厂矿的许多科室开始面向生产，解决生产中的关键问题。南通市大生纺织副厂科室同科室、科室同车间之间加强协作以后，解决了长期存在的棉纱支数不匀的问题。徐州农业机械厂有一个时期双轮双铧犁零件的质量有问题，厂里的检查课在有关课室的配合下作了检查，发现不完全符合规格的零件大都同工艺规程有关。负责工艺规程的技术课就召开车间技术员座谈会研究，并且用会诊等办法找毛病，订出改进措施，各车间和科室的技术人员把措施计划列为个人竞赛条件。这样工艺规程得以顺利地贯彻执行，零件不符合规格的问题得到了解决。
    科室人员通过社会主义竞赛，还开始学习运用群众路线的工作方法，改进工作，提高企业管理水平。如戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂工艺科和技术检查科，针对生产上废品多、返修多、质量低的情况，组织十六个工艺和检验人员，深入车间研究制定工艺标准和技术标准，使工人更加明确了解产品的质量标准和自己的责任。
