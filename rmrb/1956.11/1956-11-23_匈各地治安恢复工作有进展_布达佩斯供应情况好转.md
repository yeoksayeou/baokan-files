Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 22nd: The work of restoring public order in various parts of Hungary is making progress. In the capital, Budapest, public security organs, with the support of the masses, are continuously cracking down on and arresting counter-revolutionaries, robbers, and escaped criminals.

According to the "People's Freedom Daily," the Budapest public security forces arrested an armed group on the evening of the 20th that frequently shot at trams, fired at workers going to work, and robbed shops and pedestrians. The leader of this group of robbers, Peter, had previously served six years in prison for robbery.

In Csongrád County, the authorities had already re-imprisoned a group of bandits who had escaped from prison on the 19th. In Baranya County, the police also put a group of escaped bandits back in prison.

The Hungarian National Prosecutor's Office issued a notice stating that criminal offenders who are on the run can have their sentences reduced if they voluntarily return to prison to report; otherwise, they will be apprehended by the public security forces; if they continue to commit evil after escaping, they will be doubly punished. Many prisoners have now voluntarily returned to prison.

Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: According to a TASS report: Rezső Nyers, the supply commissioner of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, said in an interview published in the "People's Freedom Daily" on November 21st that the supply of bread, sugar, flour, oils and fats, and tobacco to residents in Budapest has reached normal levels in recent days. Measures are being taken to fully meet residents' needs for other items.

Nyers said that 3,100 of the 3,500 food stores in Budapest have reopened. Damaged stores have begun to be repaired. Enterprises are organizing food stores to supply workers with necessary consumer goods. All the most important food industrial enterprises have also resumed production.

Nyers also said that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have provided Hungary with a total of 48 million U.S. dollars in aid. Part of this aid has been handed over to Hungary for disposal free of charge. The goods transported to Hungary, in addition to grain, also include a large amount of building materials, coal, oil, and other types of industrial raw materials.

According to the "People's Freedom Daily," Hungary will receive a total of 340,000 tons of coal from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria in the shortest possible time.

    匈各地治安恢复工作有进展
    布达佩斯供应情况好转
    据新华社布达佩斯22日电　匈牙利各地的治安恢复工作正在取得进展。首都布达佩斯公安机关在群众的支持下，不断破获、逮捕反革命分子、抢劫犯和越狱的罪犯。
    据“人民自由报”报道，布达佩斯公安部队在20日晚逮捕了一个经常向电车开枪、射击上班的工人、抢劫商店和行人的武装小组。这批抢劫者的头目彼得，过去曾经因抢劫案坐过六年牢。
    在琼格拉德州，有关当局在19日已经把从监狱中逃跑的一批盗匪重新监禁起来。在巴拉涅亚州，警察也把一批越狱的盗匪重新投入监狱。
    匈牙利国家检察总署发出通告说，在逃的刑事犯如自动回狱报到可以减刑，否则将由公安部队捉拿归案；如逃狱后继续作恶就加倍处分。现在已经有许多犯人自动回狱。
    据新华社22日讯　据塔斯社报道：匈牙利工农革命政府的供应专员雷热·涅尔什11月21日在“人民自由报”发表谈话说，布达佩斯最近几天对居民需用的面包、糖、面粉、油脂和烟类的供应量，已经达到了通常的水平。目前正采取措施以充分满足居民对其他物品的需要。
    涅尔什说，布达佩斯的三千五百家食品商店已经有三千一百家开业了。被损毁的商店已经开始修复。各企业正在组织食品商店，以供应工人必要的消费品。所有最重要的食品工业企业也已经恢复了生产。
    涅尔什还说，苏联和其他社会主义国家已经给匈牙利提供了总数达四千八百万美元的援助。这种援助的一部分已经无偿地交由匈牙利处理。运到匈牙利的商品，除了粮食以外，还包括有大量的建筑材料、煤、油类和其他种类的工业原料。
    又据“人民自由报”报道，匈牙利从苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚共获得的三十四万吨煤，将在最短期内运来。
