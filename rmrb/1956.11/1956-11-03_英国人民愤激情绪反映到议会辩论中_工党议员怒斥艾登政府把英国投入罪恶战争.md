Xinhua News Agency, London, 2nd November. The House of Commons session on November 1st reflected the extreme opposition of the British people to the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt. Labour MPs angrily shouted "Resign," "Shameful," "Fascists," and "War Criminals" at Eden and other government leaders. The shouting became so intense that the House of Commons had to adjourn for half an hour.

According to parliamentary rules, the Speaker can order the meeting to be suspended when "serious disorder" occurs. According to British sources who are familiar with the parliamentary situation, this is the first time since 1923 that the meeting has been adjourned due to this situation.

When Defense Minister Head calmly announced to the House of Commons the news of British aircraft bombing Egypt, opposition MPs shouted "You should be ashamed!"

Labour leader Gaitskell said: "British aircraft bombing Egypt is not for self-defense, not for collective defense, but a blatant disregard for the United Nations Charter, which is truly shameful."

Gaitskell demanded that the government guarantee that it would immediately accept any decision made by a two-thirds majority of the United Nations General Assembly and that it would not take any further military action before such a decision was made.

Labour MP Sydney Silverman said, "The Defense Minister just spoke about using bombers, sinking ships, dropping bombs, and destroying life and property in a country that is clearly friendly to us. But there is no declaration of war."

Silverman said that it seemed as if the (Defense) Minister was telling the House of Commons that he had been using his power to force the British people to engage in illegal acts that caused death. He also said, "Can the House of Commons make it clear that people who swear allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen do not need to commit murder everywhere in the world because of this oath?"

Government leaders could not answer many questions. When Gaitskell questioned the government: Has war been declared on Egypt? Eden sat in silence, refusing to answer. At this time, Labour MPs shouted: "Answer!" "Fascist!" "Coward!" "Do you have the courage to stand up?"

Eden finally stood up and said that he would talk about all aspects of the situation in future replies.

However, the House of Commons was in an uproar and order was disrupted. Therefore, the Speaker announced a recess of half an hour. When the government ministers left the meeting room during the recess, Labour MPs stood up and shouted "Resign! Resign!"

Eden reiterated the Anglo-French position when he spoke after the House of Commons reconvened. He said: "We fully recognize the dangers of the actions we have taken, but given that we bear full responsibility and have sufficient information, we believe this is the only action that our two governments can take. We insist on this action."

Ignoring the worldwide reaction against Anglo-French actions, Eden singled out Australian Prime Minister Menzies' long statement supporting Britain to read to the House of Commons, to prove that there were still some people who supported him.

Eden exposed the true purpose of the Anglo-French action, because he said that if Egypt accepted the eighteen-nation proposal for "international control" of the Suez Canal, "the canal itself and many problems of this situation would have been resolved." Labour MP Bevan questioned Eden and asked him to explain how he linked these two events together. Eden, amidst jeers from Labour MPs, said: "If there had been immediate progress on this issue, I have no doubt that it would have significantly eased the atmosphere in other tense areas."

In the evening, while the House of Commons was debating the Labour Party's motion of censure against the government's policy of aggression in Egypt, hundreds of people crowded outside Parliament, chanting "We want peace!" "We don't want war!" "Eden must go!"

The government mobilized the police to disperse the crowd. They rode tall horses and drove the masses from one street to another, and even spectators and passers-by on the sidewalks were dispersed by the police. Finally, the police vans also arrived, threatening to arrest those who wished to express their desire for peace.

James Griffiths, in presenting Labour's motion of censure against the government to the House of Commons, said: "This week has been a dark and tragic week for our country." He continued: "The government, by plunging our country into an unjust and criminal war, has seriously violated the opinion of millions of our people, and we believe, the will of the majority of our compatriots."

He said that this action may have dealt a fatal blow to the Commonwealth and irreparably damaged alliances with Britain's friendly countries.

Griffiths said that the United Nations General Assembly would definitely declare our government—far more seriously, declare our country—an aggressor by a two-thirds majority. He also said: "When we vote in favor of this motion, we are speaking on behalf of the best people in Britain, and we ask the government to step aside" and give way to another.

Bevan asked: What is the difference between the wording of the Prime Minister's ultimatum to Egypt and the wording of the German ultimatum to Belgium on August 2, 1940?

He said: "Every country that tries to justify itself uses such wording, and I can almost quote all the ultimatums that Hitler issued to the countries he invaded."

After quoting the German ultimatum to Norway, Bevan said: "We only need to replace Norway with Egypt. This is simply speaking intimidation. Behind this, there is not even something that resembles legal grounds."

Bevan asked: "Does the government really think that if it conquers Egypt, that will be the end of the matter?"

"Does it intend to make Britain bleed in Egypt, just as France is bleeding to death in Algeria?"

He said that the government should state that it does not intend to further guide mankind on this path.

He continued, amidst enthusiastic cheers from Labour MPs: "Unless it can say that in the name of humanity, then for God's sake, get out!"

When the debate ended at about midnight, people anxiously hoping to stop the aggression were still waiting outside the heavily guarded Parliament, and police vans were parked at the gate of Parliament. As a result of the vote, because the Conservative Party after all had a majority in Parliament, the motion of censure was defeated by 324 votes to 255. After that, the House of Commons approved the government's action by 323 votes to 255.

People outside Parliament expressed their opinions, saying: "We don't want war," "We don't think Britain should attack Egypt," "We've had enough of war."

### 英国人民愤激情绪反映到议会辩论中  工党议员怒斥艾登政府把英国投入罪恶战争

    英国人民愤激情绪反映到议会辩论中
    工党议员怒斥艾登政府把英国投入罪恶战争
    新华社伦敦2日电　11月1日下院开会的情况反映了英国人民极端反对英法对埃及的侵略，工党议员愤怒地向艾登和其他政府领袖大叫“辞职”“可耻”“法西斯分子”和“战争罪犯”。叫嚷声变得如此剧烈，以致下院的会议不得不休会半小时。
    根据议会规则，当发生“严重的混乱情况”时，议长可以命令会议暂停进行。据长期熟悉议会情况的英国人士说，这是自从1923年以来会议第一次因这种情况而休会的。
    当国防大臣赫德泰然自若地向下院宣布英国飞机轰炸埃及的消息时，反对党议员大叫“你应当感到羞耻！”
    工党领袖盖次克尔说：“英国飞机轰炸埃及不是为了自卫、不是为了进行集体防御，而是公然蔑视联合国宪章，这真是可耻。”
    盖次克尔要求政府保证，在联合国大会以三分之二的多数作出任何决定时，政府将立即予以接受并且在作出这种决定之前不再采取进一步的军事行动。
    工党议员悉尼·锡尔弗曼说，“刚才国防大臣谈到了使用轰炸机，击沉船只，投掷炸弹，摧毁在一个显然和我们有着友好关系的国家里的生命财产。但是没有宣战”。
    锡尔弗曼说，看来好像（国防）大臣在告诉下院他一直在运用他的权力强迫英国人民去干造成生命死亡的非法行为。他又说，“下院能不能弄清楚，宣誓效忠女王陛下的人们不会因这种誓言而需要在世界上到处犯杀人罪呢？”
    政府领袖对许多问题都不能回答。当盖次克尔质问政府：是否已经对埃及宣战？艾登沉默地坐着拒绝回答。这时工党议员们就大叫：“答复！”“法西斯！”“胆小鬼！”“你有勇气站起来吗？”
    艾登终于站起来说，他将在以后的答复中谈到局势的各方面。
    但是下院嚷成一片，秩序大乱。因此，议长宣布休会半小时。当政府大臣们在休会时间离开会议室的时候，工党议员们站起来大叫“辞职！辞职！”
    艾登在下院复会之后发言时重申英法的态度。他说：“我们充分认识到我们所采取的行动的危险性，但是在我们负起全部责任和我们获得充分情报的情况下，我们认为这是我们两国政府所能采取的唯一行动。我们坚持这种行动。”
    艾登不理会全世界反对英法行动的反应，单单挑选了澳大利亚总理孟席斯的支持英国的长篇声明向下院宣读，来证明还有一些人支持他。
    艾登暴露了英法行动的真正目的，因为他说，如果埃及接受了“国际管制”苏伊士运河的十八国建议，“运河本身和这个局势的很多问题就会是已经获得解决的了”。工党议员比万质问艾登，要他解释他是如何把这两个事件联系在一起的。艾登在工党议员们的嘲笑声中说：“如果在这个问题上曾经获得立即的进展的话，我毫无疑问地认为，那就会使其他的紧张地区已经获得相当的缓和气氛了。”
    晚上，当下院正在辩论工党提出的对政府在埃及的侵略政策的弹劾动议的时候，成百的人拥挤在议会外面高呼“我们要和平！”“我们不要战争！”“艾登必须滚蛋！”
    政府动员了警察来驱散人群。他们骑着高头大马，把群众从一条街赶到另一条街，甚至在人行道上的看客和过路人也被警察驱散。最后，警察局的囚车也开来了，扬言要逮捕希望表示他们的和平愿望的人。
    詹姆斯·葛莱菲斯在下院提出工党对政府的弹劾动议时说：“这个星期对我国说来是一个黑暗的和悲惨的星期。”他继续说道：“政府由于使我国投入了不义的和罪恶的战争已经严重地违背了我国千百万人的意见，我们相信，违背了我们的大多数同胞的意志。”
    他说，这个行动可能已经给了英联邦以致命的打击，无可补救地损害了同英国的友邦的联盟。
    葛莱菲斯说，联合国大会一定会以三分之二的多数宣布我国政府——远为严重的是宣布我国——为侵略者。他又说：“我们在投票赞成这个动议的时候，我们是代表英国最优秀的人说话的，我们要求政府让开”，把地位让给另外一个。
    比万问道：首相在他发给埃及的最后通牒中的措词，同德国人在1940年8月2日发给比利时的最后通牒中的措词之间有哪一点不同呢？
    他说：“每一个企图为自己辩解的国家都是这样措词的，我差不多能够引述希特勒向他所侵略的国家发出的一切最后通牒。”
    比万在引述德国向挪威发出的最后通牒之后说：“我们只需用埃及来代替挪威就行了。这就是干脆讲威吓的话。在这后面，甚至连类乎法律理由的东西都是没有的。”
    比万问道：“政府是否真的以为，要是它征服了埃及，事情就算完了呢？”
    “它是否打算使英国在埃及流血，就像法国正在阿尔及利亚流血到死一样呢？”
    他说，政府应该说明它不打算再进一步引导人类在这条道路上前进。
    他在工党议员发出热烈的欢呼声中接着说：“除非它能够以人类的名义那样说，否则为了上帝，请滚蛋！”
    辩论大约在半夜结束的时候，弹劾的动议提付表决，那时候，焦虑地希望制止侵略的人们仍然守候在严加保护的议会外面，警察的囚车就停在议会的大门口。表决结果，由于保守党毕竟在议会中占有多数，弹劾动议以二百五十五票对三百二十四票被击败了。这之后，下院又以三百二十三票对二百五十五票批准了政府的行动。
    在议会外面的人们发表意见说：“我们不要战争”，“我们觉得英国不应该进攻埃及”，“仗我们已经打够了。”
