Among them are mothers of revolutionary martyrs, veteran Red Army soldiers from the Second Domestic Revolutionary War period and family members of Red Army martyrs, disabled soldiers who have lost their sight or both lower limbs but still insist on working and have made great contributions, and demobilized soldiers who have made significant achievements on the production front.

He said: "Chairman Mao instructed us: 'Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory.' You have not disappointed the Party and Chairman Mao's expectations of you, which was the case during the war and even more so during the construction period." In his report, he called on the activists present and the families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers across the country to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, unite the masses, move forward together, and become a permanently active force in socialist construction.

　　In his report, Xie Juezai also talked about the achievements and shortcomings of the preferential treatment and demobilization resettlement work over the past few years. He hoped that civil affairs departments at all levels would earnestly examine the preferential treatment and demobilization resettlement work, formulate specific improvement measures, and further improve the preferential treatment and demobilization resettlement work.
