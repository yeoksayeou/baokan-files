    Opposing Food Waste
    Pu Lü District Grain Station, Tongliang, Sichuan

    Rice in the Bran, Worms in the Granary
    Sales Not Following Regulations

    On the afternoon of September 12th, I, along with Comrade Ye Benzhang, director of the Tongliang Grain Bureau Processing Factory in Sichuan, inspected the work at the Pu Lü District Grain Station. We discovered that the processed rice husks contained a lot of broken rice, unhusked rice, and small rice particles. From five jin of rice husks, we extracted twelve liang of broken rice, small rice particles, and unhusked rice. That evening, the grain station held a meeting of the heads of each grain point. People didn't believe it, so they processed another nineteen jin of rice husks, and again extracted two dou and two jin of small rice particles and unhusked rice. The next day, I went to the Qinglong Grain Point of the station to inspect, and their processed rice husks also contained a large amount of broken rice. This time, the station processed 2.9 million jin of rice paddy. Assuming 1,800 jin of rice husks per 10,000 jin of rice paddy, there would be 522,000 jin of rice husks. And assuming one jin of broken rice is extracted from every fifteen jin of rice husks, there should be a loss of 34,800 jin of broken rice and small rice particles. At the local price of 4.6 fen per jin of lower-grade broken rice, the total loss would be over 1,600 yuan.

    The station's rate of producing refined rice after processing is also very poor. Generally, 75 to 77 jin of refined rice are recovered from every 100 jin of rice paddy. However, after processing rice paddy at the Qinglong Grain Point, only 71.4 jin of refined rice were produced per 100 jin (the higher authority requires 78 to 79 jin of refined rice to be processed from every 100 jin of rice paddy). If we calculate this, there will be another loss of tens of thousands of jin.

    The grain storage work at this station is even worse. I randomly inspected some civilian granaries at the Qinglong Grain Point and found that the pest infestation in each granary was very serious. I sifted one kilogram of grain in the granary of Hu Kaishi in the sixth village of the point, and found more than 1,300 insects. The same was true in the granary of Yan Huaqing in the same village. The insect infestation inside the granaries was serious, and most of the rice grains were hollowed out by insects. It was impossible to find a pest-free granary in the whole district, whether it was a public or civilian granary. Due to poor storage, more than 100,000 jin of grain in the district have been eaten by insects.

    The station is also very chaotic in its purchase and sale operations, and does not follow the national policy for unified grain purchase and sales. The grain consumption of various government agencies, schools, organizations, and industrial and commercial households does not follow the supply plan; they sell as much as they buy. There is no one responsible for the custody of various grain vouchers, and grain coupons are everywhere. The grain points do not hand in or account for the grain coupons collected from the sale of rice.

    Are the above-mentioned serious problems caused by a shortage of cadres? No, there are not few cadres at all. There are 34 cadres in the whole district, plus more than 40 temporary and long-term employees. The backbone of the cadres is also strong, with eight Party members and six Youth League members. Moreover, the grain station in the district has a relatively small storage task. The average storage volume per storekeeper is less than one million jin, while the special bureau and county bureau require each storekeeper to manage 1.5 million jin. However, they did not conscientiously do this work well.

    I am very heartbroken to see these serious problems. I request the higher authorities to conduct a thorough inspection of the work of this station in a timely manner and to give serious punishment to the irresponsible cadres. At the same time, I hope that the work of other grain stations can also be given attention.

        Some Areas in Jiangsu
    Government Canteens Hoarding Grain
    Too Much Grain Supplied for Cooked Food

    In many areas of Jiangsu Province, the unified grain sales policy is too lax. Mess halls and canteens are not strictly enforcing the system of collecting grain coupons, resulting in many government agencies and enterprises hoarding and wasting large quantities of grain.

    The mess hall of the Xupu District government in Changshu County had already saved more than 1,500 jin of grain coupons and rice in August, and still deliberately told the grain department that they did not have enough grain and applied for subsidies. The Yancheng Company of Taizhou stipulates that family members of employees who come to the agency to eat for less than half a month do not need to pay grain coupons. The New Haizhou Power Plant employees’ canteen had nine jin of leftover noodles after a meal, all of which were poured into the sewage pool.

    Blindly expanding the supply of grain for the cooked food industry has also caused a lot of waste. Suzhou's biscuits have a lot of inventory; more than 10,000 jin have become moldy or infested with insects. The cooked food industry in Yangzhou used more than double the amount of grain in September compared to the previous monthly consumption.

    These phenomena have already attracted the attention of the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Department, and they are trying to correct them. However, eliminating these phenomena requires the cooperation and assistance of all parties. This situation of wasting grain should also arouse the vigilance of relevant departments in other parts of the country. Lu Ning

    Yuele Grain Depot, Huachi County, Gansu Province
    Consistently Neglecting Grain Storage
    More Than 10,000 Jin of Grain Spoiled

    The staff of the Yuele Grain Depot in Huachi County, Gansu Province, has consistently failed to attach importance to grain inspection and storage. In the past year or two, several accidents of grain spoilage and deterioration have occurred, causing significant losses to people's property. In 1954, the depot had an accident in which more than 2,000 jin of buckwheat became damp, but this did not attract the attention of the grain depot负责人 [fù zé rén - person in charge]. In July of this year, more than 3,000 jin of grain deteriorated and became moldy. Then, on two separate occasions, more than 15,000 jin of grain were found to be moldy. In total, more than 18,000 jin of grain have spoiled this year. It is said that this is not the full figure for the spoiled grain.

    Why does this grain depot repeatedly have grain spoilage accidents? It is hoped that the relevant departments will investigate and deal with this.

        Anshan Grain Depot, Liaoning
    180 Tons of Wheat Bran Shipped Out
    Containing Large Amounts of Flour

    In October, the Anshan Grain Depot in Liaoning Province shipped 180 tons of wheat bran for animal feed to the Ninghe County Grain Bureau in Hebei Province. After inspection by the Ninghe Grain Bureau, the bran contained a lot of flour residue. Processing experiments showed that these bran could still produce a lot of dark flour, and the quality was higher than ordinary second-grade flour, and was completely edible. It is such a pity that the Anshan Grain Depot treated it as animal feed!

    This kind of careless phenomenon in grain processing is by no means isolated; every year, I don't know how much grain is wasted for the country. I suggest everyone pay attention to this issue.

    Some Units in Linfen, Shanxi
    Leftover Food and Steamed Buns Thrown Everywhere
    Flour and Rice Moldy and Infested with Insects

    Serious waste of grain exists in units such as the People's Hospital, the Food and Beverage Company, and the Department Store in Linfen County, Shanxi Province. In the People's Hospital of Linfen County, many pieces of steamed buns and leftover rice floated in the kitchen's sewage buckets. Of the ten employees' drawers that were inspected, five contained moldy and spoiled, inedible steamed buns, totaling more than three jin. Of the 29 bags of flour in the inventory of the No. 2 Canteen of the Linfen County Food and Beverage Company, 12 were moldy and spoiled. All of the more than 200 jin of rice in stock were infested with insects. In order to dispose of its backlog of condensed milk, the Linfen County Department Store processed 4,000 jin of biscuits using grain and condensed milk. Due to poor storage, more than 1,900 jin of biscuits were infested with insects. The selling price was reduced from 7.7 jiao per jin to 4.5 jiao, which not only resulted in economic losses, but also wasted grain.

### 反对浪费粮食

    反对浪费粮食
    四川铜梁蒲吕区粮站
    糠里有米仓里生虫
    销粮不按制度办事
    9月12日下午，我同四川铜梁粮食局加工厂厂长叶本章同志在蒲吕区粮站检查工作，发现加工过的谷壳内有很多碎米、谷子和碛米。在五市斤谷壳中，就车出碎米、碛米、谷子有十二两。我们又车了谷壳十九斤，又车出碛米、碛碎米二斗谷二斤。当天晚上，粮站召开各粮点的点长会议，大家还不相信，又去车谷壳十九斤，结果也车出碎米二斗、谷二斤来。第二天，我到该站庆隆粮点去检查，他们加工的谷壳里也是有大量的碎米。这次该站加工稻谷二百九十万斤，以每万斤折谷壳一千八百斤计，就有谷壳五十二万二千斤。又以每十五斤谷壳车出碎米一斤计，就该损失碎米、碛米达三万四千八百斤。每斤按当地下等碎米价四分六计，共损失人民币一千六百多元。
    该站加工后碛米的成率也是非常低劣的。一般每百斤稻谷加工收回碛米七十五斤至七十七斤左右。而庆隆粮点稻谷加工后的碛米每百斤才七十一斤四两，（上级要求是每百斤稻谷加工碛米是七十八斤至七十九斤），如果计算起来又是数万斤的损失啊。
    该站的粮食保管工作更是糟糕。我抽查了庆隆粮点部分民仓存粮，发现每仓的虫害都非常严重，我在该点六村胡开仕仓中，筛了一公斤粮食。虫子就有一千三百多头。该村严华清的仓内也是如此。仓内虫害严重，大部分的谷粒被虫钻空；全区不论公仓和民仓找不出一间无虫粮仓。由于保管不善，全区被虫子吃光了的粮食达十多万斤。
    该站在购销业务上也非常混乱，不按国家粮食统销政策办事。各机关学校团体以及工商户用粮都不执行供应计划，买多少就卖多少。各种粮食证明票无专人负责保管，遍地都是粮票。粮点销售大米收回的粮票，也不上缴，也不报帐。
    产生以上严重的问题是干部少了吗？不，干部一点也不少，全区有干部三十四人，加上临时雇用和长期雇用的有四十多人。干部中骨干也很强，有党员八人、团员六人，而该区粮站的保管任务又比较小，每个保管员的保管量平均还不到一百万斤，专局和县局的要求每个保管员的保管量一百五十万斤。然而他们并没有认真搞好这件工作。
    我看到这些严重问题，真是痛心得很。要求上级及时对该站的工作进行彻底的检查，对不负责任的干部给以严肃处理，同时希望其他粮站的工作也能加以注意。

        江苏一些地区
  机关食堂积压粮食
    熟食用粮供应过多
    江苏省许多地区粮食统销偏松，伙食单位执行收粮票的制度不严，许多机关、企业大量积压和浪费粮食。
    常熟县浒浦区机关食堂在8月份已结余了一千五百多斤粮票和大米，还故意向粮食部门喊粮食不够吃，申请补助。泰州市盐业公司规定：职工家属来机关吃饭在半个月以内的，不收粮票。新海连市电厂职工食堂吃了一次面条剩下了九斤，全部倒在污水池里。
    盲目扩大供应熟食业用粮，造成浪费的情况也不少。苏州市的饼干积压很多，现在已有一万多斤发霉或生了虫。扬州市熟食业9月份用粮比过去每月用粮增加一倍多。
    这些现象，虽然已经引起江苏省粮食厅的注意，并且正在设法纠正，但是，要消除这些现象，还需要各方面的配合和帮助。这种浪费粮食的情况，也值得引起全国其他地方有关部门的警惕。　鲁　宁
    甘肃华池县悦乐粮库
    一贯忽视粮食保管
    一万多斤粮食霉坏
    甘肃省华池县悦乐粮库的工作人员一贯不重视粮食检查和保管工作，近一两年来，数次发生粮食霉坏变质事故，使人民财产受到重大损失。1954年，该库曾发生两千多斤荞麦受湿事故，但是并没有引起粮库负责人注意。今年7月，又有三千多斤粮食霉坏变质。接着，又先后两次发现一万五千多斤粮食霉坏。共计今年霉坏粮食一万八千多斤。据说，这还不是全部霉坏粮食的数字。
    为什么这个粮库会一而再地发生粮食霉坏事故呢？希望有关部门检查处理。

        辽宁鞍山粮库
    调出麦麸一百八十吨
    内含大量的面粉
    辽宁省鞍山粮库10月份调给河北省宁河县粮食局饲料麦麸一百八十吨。经宁河粮食局检查，麸内含粉渣很多，加工试验结果，这些麸皮还能出许多黑面，质量高于一般次粉，完全可以食用。鞍山粮库把它当作饲料来处理，这是多么可惜呀！
    像这种加工粮食漫不经心的现象，绝不是个别的；每年不知给国家浪费多少粮食。我建议大家注意这个问题。
        韩立田　郑子田　杨凤池	    山西临汾一些单位
    剩饭剩馍到处乱扔
    面粉大米发霉生虫
    山西省临汾县人民医院、饮食业公司、百货公司等单位都存在着严重的浪费粮食的情况。临汾县人民医院厨房的污水桶中飘浮着不少馍块和剩饭。在被检查的十个职工的抽屉中，就有五个人的抽屉存放有已经霉坏变质、不能食用的馒头，共有三斤之多。临汾县饮食业公司第二食堂库存的二十九袋面粉，就有十二袋霉坏变质。库存的二百多斤大米，也全部生了虫。临汾县百货公司为了处理积压的炼乳，用粮食和炼乳加工了四千斤饼干，由于保管不善，结果有一千九百多斤饼干生了虫，售价从每斤七角七分降为四角五分，不但在经济上受到损失，而且也浪费了粮食。
