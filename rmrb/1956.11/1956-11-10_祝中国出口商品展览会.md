    The "Chinese Export Commodities Fair" sponsored by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade has opened in Guangzhou. We extend our congratulations to this grand fair and warmly welcome foreign business people, overseas Chinese businessmen, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao who have been invited to visit and trade with us.
    The Chinese Export Commodities Fair held this time in Guangzhou is the largest exhibition since the founding of our country. It exhibits new products of our heavy industry, light industry, handicrafts and valuable native products. Some of these commodities are traditional export commodities of our country, and some are newly produced commodities in our socialist construction. Through this exhibition, it will inevitably enhance the understanding of foreign business people of the variety, quality, specifications and production potential of our export commodities, thereby promoting trade and economic cooperation between our country and other countries.
    The exhibition of the Chinese Export Commodities Fair once again powerfully proves that developing trade relations between countries on the basis of mutual respect for national sovereignty and equality and mutual benefit is a principle consistently followed by our government. Our government and people have always advocated that, on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and equality and mutual benefit, we are willing to establish and develop trade relations with any country in the world, regardless of its social system or whether it has diplomatic relations with our country. This proposition is consistent with our country's peaceful foreign policy; at the same time, it also shows the strong desire of our government and people for world peace and the development of international trade. It is precisely because our government has implemented this principle that trade relations between our country and many countries have been gradually established and developed. Especially since the Asian-African Conference, this trade relationship has been more broadly developed. This development is specifically manifested in the increase in trade relations and the increase in trade volume between our country and various countries. At present, there are sixty-eight countries and regions that have trade relations with our country, of which twenty-one countries have signed intergovernmental trade agreements with our country. In 1955, my country's total trade volume was 2.6 times that of the early days of liberation in 1950, with an average annual increase of 21%. My country's trade volume with the Asian-African region increased by about 18.4% in 1955 compared with 1954; in the first half of 1956, my country's trade volume with the Asian-African region increased by 53% compared with the same period in 1955. In recent years, in addition to continuing to consolidate and develop trade relations with many Southeast Asian countries, our country has also concluded intergovernmental trade agreements and transaction contracts with Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Cambodia and other countries, and the exchange of letters with the Sudanese government also expressed the desire to develop trade between the two countries. These agreements and contracts are in line with the principles of equality and mutual benefit, friendly cooperation, and mutual respect for national sovereignty; this is in sharp contrast to the colonialist countries' consistent policy of manipulating and devaluing the raw materials produced by Asian and African countries, dumping their own surplus products, monopolizing other countries' markets, and infringing on other countries' economic independence and national interests.
    The development of trade relations between our country and various countries is based on the needs of both parties' economic development. The facts of the past can prove this. Many Asian and African countries need a large number of industrial products, so we have supplied building steel, iron nails, iron wire, paper, cloth, machinery, certain complete sets of equipment and other industrial products according to the needs of each country; at the same time, our country has also purchased a large amount of cotton, jute, sacks, copra, etc., which our country needs, from Asian and African countries. This kind of trade relationship is carried out under the principle of mutual benefit on both sides. Both economically and technically, it is conducive to promoting the independent economic development of each other. This cooperation will undoubtedly help to ensure the national independence of Asian and African countries and expand the area of ​​peace, which is conducive to maintaining lasting world peace and beneficial to the improvement of the lives of the people of all countries. Although the scope of this cooperation is not yet widespread, since everyone has a common desire for peace, cooperation, and independent development of their own economies, the development of normal trade between us is completely necessary and possible.
    Our government is also willing to develop trade relations with other countries in the world (including Western countries) on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. Although the United States has imposed an embargo on our country and forced many countries to adopt the same policy towards our country, in the past few years, our country's trade with Western countries has still increased considerably. Chinese business groups have successively signed trade agreements and transaction contracts with business groups from many countries such as Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Chile. The embargo policy adopted by the US aggression group, which violates the interests of the people of all countries, has been met with increasingly strong opposition from all parties. Now, more and more business people and officials from various countries, including some business people and officials from Western countries, have gradually realized that the implementation of the "blockade" and "embargo" policies and trade discrimination policies has not restricted the successful implementation of the first five-year plan of the People's Republic of China and the continued rise of the national economy; on the contrary, it has only increased the economic difficulties of Western countries and countries controlled by Western imperialism, and damaged their own interests. They are increasingly strongly demanding the cancellation of the "blockade" and "embargo." We can say with certainty that this unreasonable man-made obstacle will sooner or later go bankrupt completely.
    The exhibition of the Chinese Export Commodities Fair also shows that on the basis of the continuous development of our country's industry and agriculture, the production potential of export commodities is growing, and the material foundation of our foreign trade is expanding and consolidating. Various materials suitable for export among our industrial and agricultural products are increasing to varying degrees every year. With the development of our country's production, the types of export commodities will increase year by year. Many heavy industrial products, such as various machine tools, complete sets of light industrial equipment, water conservancy irrigation equipment, electric motors, diesel engines, construction machinery, chemical products, etc., can also be exported or have begun to be exported. In addition, our country also has many traditional export commodities, which have always been commonly used by people of all countries and our compatriots. Such as silk, silk, tea, egg products, porcelain, various fresh fruits and foods, canned foods, various dried fruits, winter vegetables, rosin, vermicelli, various medicinal materials, handicrafts and other native products, the output has increased to varying degrees, and the quality, specifications, packaging, etc. have also been greatly improved and improved. At the same time, our country also needs to import means of production and a certain amount of consumer goods urgently needed by the people's lives from abroad. It can be seen that our country's trade with all countries in the world has broad prospects.
    The Chinese Export Commodities Fair plays an extremely important role in promoting mutual understanding between countries and strengthening trade exchanges and economic cooperation between our country and various countries. We wish this exhibition a major victory and success, and sincerely hope that trade relations between our country and countries around the world, especially countries in the Asian-African region, will develop more widely.

### 祝中国出口商品展览会

    祝中国出口商品展览会
    中国国际贸易促进委员会主办的“中国出口商品展览会”在广州开幕了。我们对这个盛大的展览会表示祝贺，并对应邀前来我国参观和交易的国外工商界人士、侨商以及港澳同胞，表示热烈的欢迎。
    这次在广州举行的中国出口商品展览会，是我国开国以来规模最大的一个展览会。它展出的出口商品，有我国重工业、轻工业、手工艺的新产品和名贵的土特产品等。这些商品，有的是我国传统的出口商品，有的是我国在社会主义建设中新出产的商品。通过这次展出，必然会增进国外工商界人士对我国出口商品的品种、质量、规格以及它的生产潜力的了解，从而促进我国同各国的贸易往来和经济合作。
    中国出口商品展览会的展出，又一次有力地证明，在互相尊重国家主权和平等互利的基础上，发展各国之间的贸易关系，是我国政府一贯遵循的原则。我国政府和人民一向主张，在互相尊重主权和平等互利的基础上，愿同世界上任何一个国家建立和发展贸易关系，不论它的社会制度如何，也不论它同我国有无外交关系。这种主张同我国的和平外交政策是一致的；同时这也表明了我国政府和人民要求世界和平、要求发展国际贸易的强烈愿望。正是由于我国政府贯彻执行了这个原则，我国同许多国家间的贸易关系已经逐步建立和发展起来。特别是从亚非会议以来，这种贸易关系更有了广泛的发展。这种发展，具体地表现在我国同各国的贸易关系的增进和贸易额的增长上。目前和我国有贸易关系的国家和地区有六十八个，其中有二十一个国家同我国签订了政府间的贸易协定。1955年我国贸易总额为解放初期1950年的二点六倍，平均每年递增21％。我国对亚非地区贸易额，1955年比1954年增长了18.4％左右；1956年上半年，我国同亚非地区贸易额又比1955年同期增加了53％。近年来，我国除了继续巩固和发展同许多东南亚国家的贸易关系以外，并同埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、柬埔寨等国缔结了政府间的贸易协定和交易合同，同苏丹政府的换文也表达了发展两国贸易的愿望。这些协定和合同都是符合平等互利、友好互助和互相尊重国家主权的原则的；这同殖民主义国家一贯采取的对亚非国家所生产的原料操纵、压价、倾销它们本国的剩余产品、垄断别国市场、侵犯别国经济独立和民族利益的政策，恰恰成为鲜明的对比。
    我国同各国贸易关系的发展，是建立在有利于双方经济发展需要的基础上的。过去的事实就可以证明这一点。很多亚非国家需要大量的工业用品，我们就根据各个国家的需要供应了建筑钢材、铁钉、铁丝、纸张、布匹、机器、某些成套设备及其他工业产品；同时，我国也从亚非国家大量地购进了我国所需要的棉花、黄麻、麻袋、椰干等。这种贸易关系，都是在双方自愿互利的原则下进行的。无论在经济上和技术上，都有利于促进彼此经济的独立发展。这种合作，无疑地将有助于保障亚非各国的民族独立和扩大和平地区，有利于维护世界的持久和平，有益于各国人民生活的改善。尽管这种合作的范围现在还不够普遍，但由于大家都有要求和平、要求合作、要求独立发展自己经济的共同愿望，我们之间的正常贸易的发展是完全必要的、可能的。
    我国政府还愿意在平等互利的原则下，同世界上其他国家（包括西方国家）发展贸易关系。尽管美国对我国实行禁运，并且强迫许多国家对我国采取同样的政策，但是，几年来我国同西方国家的贸易还是有了相当的增长。我国工商团体先后和英国、法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰、瑞士、智利等许多国家的工商团体签订了贸易协议和交易合同。美国侵略集团所采取的违反各国人民利益的禁运政策，已经遭到各方面日益强烈的反对。现在，已经有越来越多的各国工商界人士和官方人士，包括西方国家某些工商界人士和官方人士，都逐渐体会到“封锁”“禁运”政策和贸易歧视政策实行的结果，并没有限制住中华人民共和国第一个五年计划胜利进行和国民经济继续高涨；相反地，只增加了西方国家和受西方帝国主义控制的国家的经济困难，损害了他们自己的利益。他们越来越强烈地要求取消“封锁”“禁运”。我们可以肯定地说：这个不合理的人为的障碍，早晚是会彻底破产的。
    中国出口商品展览会的展出还表明，在我国工业、农业不断发展的基础上，出口商品的生产潜力正在日益增长，我国对外贸易的物质基础正在日益扩大和巩固。我国工农业产品中各种适宜于出口的物资，每年都有不同程度的增长。随着我国生产的发展，出口商品的种类将会逐年增加。许多重工业产品，如各种工作母机、轻工业成套设备、水利灌溉设备、电动机、柴油机、建筑机械、化学产品等，也可以输出或已开始输出。此外，我国还有许多传统的出口商品，是一向为各国人民和我国侨胞所惯用的。如绸缎、绢丝、茶叶、蛋品、瓷器、各种鲜果食品、罐头食品、各种干果、冬菜、松香、粉丝、各种药材、手工艺品及其他各种土特产品等，产量都有不同程度的增加，质量、规格、包装等也有了相当的改善和提高。同时，我国也需要从国外输入生产资料和一定数量的人民生活迫切需要的消费品。由此可见，我国同世界各国的贸易是有广阔前途的。
    中国出口商品展览会，对于促进各国间的互相了解，加强我国和各国间的贸易往来和经济合作，具有极其重大的作用。我们预祝这个展览会获得重大的胜利和成就，并衷心地希望我国和世界各国，特别是和亚非地区各国之间的贸易关系，更广泛地发展起来。
