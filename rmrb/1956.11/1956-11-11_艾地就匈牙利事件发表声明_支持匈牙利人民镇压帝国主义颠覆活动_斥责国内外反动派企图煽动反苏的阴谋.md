Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 10th: The Jakarta "People's Daily" published on November 7th a statement by D.N. Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, regarding the Hungarian events.

The statement said that just as the Indonesian people were busy devoting all their efforts to supporting Egypt's struggle against the military aggression jointly launched by the three aggressor nations of Britain, France, and Israel, Indonesian reactionaries, represented by some leaders of the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party, and their newspapers, began to vigorously agitate regarding the so-called "Soviet military attack on Hungary."

Through this agitation, they equated the Soviet Union's foreign policy with the foreign policies of countries like the United States, Britain, and France. At the same time, they also suggested that the Warsaw Pact was no different from imperialist aggressive pacts such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The statement said that, first of all, it must be pointed out that, unlike the foreign policies of imperialist countries such as the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands, which aim to enslave other countries by controlling their economic lifelines, political and military power, the Soviet Union's foreign policy advocates international cooperation and peace among all countries, large and small, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

The relationship between the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democracies, in addition to being based on the aforementioned Five Principles, is also built on the common goal and unity of defending and safeguarding the security of the socialist achievements gained in the struggle against imperialist counter-revolutionary conspiracies and efforts. To this end, these countries signed the Warsaw Pact on May 14, 1955.

The statement said that the way People's Democracies defend socialist achievements is primarily through military defense, using it to counter armed intervention and aggression by imperialists like the United States and Britain, whether this intervention and aggression manifests itself as a new war they are planning in Europe, or as counter-revolutionary activities such as terrorist activities and sabotage they carry out against the People's Democracies.

The statement pointed out that everyone knows that the United States government, in accordance with the resolution passed by the US Congress in April 1951 (allocating 100 million US dollars for the implementation of the Mutual Security Act), formally organized anti-national aggressive activities in these countries. The basic purpose of this imperialist activity is to eliminate the socialist achievements of these countries. Therefore, it is precisely the governments of the United States and other imperialist countries that are interfering in Hungary's internal affairs.

The statement said that in order to suppress imperialist subversive activities, the Hungarian government led by Kádár invoked Article 4 of the Warsaw Treaty and requested military assistance from the Soviet Union. Based on this fact, the Soviet Union's military assistance to Hungary is legitimate and does not violate the will of the recipient country. The issue is that it is for the purpose of defending and safeguarding the achievements of socialism. According to the Warsaw Treaty, the Soviet Union is obliged to fulfill this request and dispatch its armed forces to assist the Hungarian government and people in defending the established People's Democratic state. That is to say, the Soviet army's assistance is to resist and frustrate the counter-revolutionary and destructive activities of the United States, Britain, and other imperialists aimed at overthrowing the legitimate People's Democratic regime and restoring the capitalist and landlord regime.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet army's actions in Hungary are distinctly different from the invasion of Egypt by the armies of Britain, France, and Israel. The invasion of Egypt by the three countries of Britain, France, and Israel is indeed an act of aggression.

The statement concluded by saying that the Indonesian Communist Party supports the efforts of the Hungarian people and workers, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and with the strong assistance of the Soviet army, to defend Hungary's socialist achievements and people's democracy. The Indonesian Communist Party urges the Indonesian government and all the people to maintain a vigilant attitude towards the conspiracies of the reactionaries. The reactionaries' conspiracy is consistent with the imperialists' scheme: that is, to divert the attention and efforts of the Indonesian people from the Egyptian people's struggle against Anglo-French-Israeli aggression.

### 艾地就匈牙利事件发表声明  支持匈牙利人民镇压帝国主义颠覆活动  斥责国内外反动派企图煽动反苏的阴谋

    艾地就匈牙利事件发表声明
    支持匈牙利人民镇压帝国主义颠覆活动  斥责国内外反动派企图煽动反苏的阴谋
    新华社雅加达10日电　雅加达“人民日报”11月7日登载了印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地关于匈牙利事件的声明。
    声明说，正当印度尼西亚人民忙于全力地支援埃及反抗英法以三个侵略国共同发动的军事侵略的斗争的时候，以马斯友美党、印度尼西亚社会党的一些领袖为代表的印度尼西亚反动派和它们的报纸，却开始大事进行所谓“苏联对匈牙利的军事进攻”的煽动。
    通过这种煽动，他们把苏联的外交政策和美英法等国的外交政策等同看待。同时，它们也说似乎华沙条约是和帝国主义的侵略性公约如北大西洋公约和东南亚条约组织没有两样。
    声明说，首先，必须指出，和目的在于通过控制别国的经济命脉、政治和军事权力来奴役别国的美英法荷等帝国主义国家的外交政策不同，苏联的外交政策是主张在和平共处五项原则的基础上实现一切大小国家间的国际合作和和平。
    苏联和东欧人民民主国家间的关系，除了基于上述五项原则之外，还建立在为保卫和维护在反对帝国主义反革命的阴谋和努力中所获得的社会主义成果的安全这个共同目的和团结一致的基础上。为此，这些国家在1955年5月14日签订了华沙条约。
    声明说，人民民主国家保卫社会主义成果的方式，首先是军事保卫的方式，用它来对付美英等帝国主义的武装干预和侵略，不论这种干预和侵略是表现为它们所筹划的欧洲新战争，还是表现为它们对人民民主国家所进行的恐怖活动、破坏活动等反革命活动。
    声明指出，人人都知道，美国政府依照美国国会1951年4月通过的决议（拨款一亿美元供实施共同安全法案之用），正式组织在这些国家的反国家的侵略性活动。这种帝国主义活动的基本目的，就是要取消这些国家的社会主义成果。因此，正是美国和其他帝国主义国家的政府干预匈牙利的内政。
    声明说，为了镇压帝国主义的颠复活动，由卡达尔领导的匈牙利政府援引了华沙条约第四条要求苏联给予军事援助。基于这个事实，苏联对匈牙利的军事援助是合法的，而不违反受援国家的意愿的。问题在于这是为了保卫和维护社会主义的成果。根据华沙条约，苏联有义务满足这个要求，而调遣他的武装部队来协助匈牙利政府和人民保卫已经建立起来的人民民主国家。就是说，苏军的援助是为了反抗和挫败美英等帝国主义目的在于推翻合法的人民民主政权和恢复资本家和地主政权的反革命和破坏活动。
    声明指出，苏军在匈牙利的行动和英法以军队进攻埃及是截然不同的。英法以三国进攻埃及确实是一种侵略行动。
    声明最后说，印度尼西亚共产党支持匈牙利人民和工人在匈牙利社会主义工人党领导下和苏军大力援助下正在为保卫匈牙利的社会主义成果和人民民主而作的努力。印度尼西亚共产党吁请印度尼西亚政府和全体人民对反动派的阴谋保持警惕的态度。反动派的阴谋是和帝国主义者的这个计谋是一致的：这就是目的在于转移印度尼西亚人民对埃及人民反抗英法以侵略的斗争所寄予的注意力和所作的努力。
