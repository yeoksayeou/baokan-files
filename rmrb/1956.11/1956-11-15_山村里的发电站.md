    Hydroelectric Station in a Mountain Village
    Tu Zhengfeng
    In June and July of this year, the Sumeng Village in Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, built a 12-kilowatt wooden turbine power station. It can supply electricity for production and lighting to more than 700 farm households in eleven natural villages, including Sumeng, Houxu, and Xiayuan.
    This hydropower station is one of the five different prime mover (hydropower, diesel, gas, low-grade fuel oil, and steam) power station experiments established by the China National Transportation Electric Engineering & Equipment Corporation in the Zhejiang area. During the construction process, they signed a contract with the Sumeng Village Lianqun Agricultural Cooperative, adopted a deferred payment method for electrical equipment, provided free technical assistance, imparted mechanical management and safe electricity use knowledge to the farmers, and trained two electrical workers for this agricultural cooperative. The investment in the station was only 16,000 yuan, while the annual income from rice milling and processing alone can reach more than 1,700 yuan.
    Farmers in mountainous areas of our country have long used local materials to manufacture wooden wheels and build water-powered mills along mountain streams to replace manual labor for husking rice, grinding flour, and making paper. According to a survey by the Rural Small Hydropower Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Department, among the 81 counties in the province, except for the coastal islands and the plains of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, where there are fewer, farmers in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas have built more than 5,000 large and small water-powered mills along streams. In Jiande County alone, there are more than 150, most of which can be converted into small hydropower stations with a capacity of 5 to 25 kilowatts.
    Generating electricity with wooden turbines is about half the price of iron turbines, and it can also be manufactured and used locally in mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation. Wooden turbines are lightweight, technically simpler, and easier to install and maintain. Based on the experience of training farmer administrators at the Sumeng small hydropower station, cooperative members with a junior high school education can basically operate and manage it after three months of practice. Wooden turbines are suitable for lower heads of water. They can be used to generate electricity with water heads ranging from below 10 meters to above 2 meters. These favorable conditions enable small villages scattered in deep mountains and narrow valleys to install electric lights. The relevant central departments have decided to promote this throughout the country. The China National Transportation Electric Engineering & Equipment Corporation's branches and sub-branches in 21 provinces and cities, including Fujian, Hunan, Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Xinjiang, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Tianjin, have successively sent 49 representatives to Zhejiang to learn from the experience of building stations.

    山村里的发电站
    屠正峰
    今年六、七月间，浙江省金华县苏孟村兴建了一座十二瓩的木制水轮机发电站。它可供应苏孟、后徐、下元等十一个自然村七百多农户的生产和照明用电。
    这座水电站是中国交通电工器材公司在浙江地区试验建立五种不同原动力（水力、柴油、煤气、低级燃料油和蒸气）发电站中的一个。在建站过程中，他们同苏孟村联群农业合作社订立合同，在电工器材上采取赊销分期付款的办法；技术上给予无代价的帮助，向农民传授了机械管理和安全用电知识，并为这个农业社培养了两名电气工人。建站的投资只有一万六千元，而全年仅稻谷碾磨加工收入就可达一千七百多元。
    我国山区农民很早就有人就地取材制造木轮、沿山溪建造水碓来代替人力舂米、磨面和造纸。据浙江省水利厅农村小型水力发电处的调查，全省八十一个县中除了沿海岛屿和杭（州）、嘉（兴）、湖（州）平原地区较少外，山区和半山区农民沿溪建造大小水碓有五千多处，仅建德一县就有一百五十多处，其中大部分可以用来改建为五至二十五瓩的小型水力发电站。
    用木制的水轮机发电，价格比铁质的水轮机便宜一半左右，在交通不便的山区还可以就地制造应用。木制水轮机轻便，技术较简单，安装和检修也方便。根据苏孟小型水力发电站培养农民管理员的经验，有初中文化程度的社员，经过三个月的实习就基本上可以操纵管理。木制水轮机适用于较低的水头。在十公尺以下至二公尺以上的水头都可用来发电。这些有利条件使分散居住在深山狭谷的小村落也可以装上电灯。中央有关部门已经决定在全国农村推广。福建、湖南、山东、河南、四川、江苏、新疆和上海、广州、重庆、天津等二十一个省、市的中国交通电工器材分、支公司，已先后派出了四十九个代表，去浙江学习建站经验。
