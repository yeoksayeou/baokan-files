Xinhua News Agency, 7th - Under the firm opposition of the entire world and the serious warning from the Soviet Union, the British and French governments announced on the evening of November 6th that they had ordered their armed forces attacking Egypt to implement a ceasefire at midnight on the 6th, "unless they are attacked (by the other side)." The notifications from Britain and France regarding the ceasefire issue were published by United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the same day.

This decision was made jointly by Britain and France after urgent consultations, under the repeated demands of the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Session for all parties to immediately cease fire and the serious warning from the Soviet Union against British and French aggression. Although Britain and France expressed their willingness to implement a ceasefire in their notifications to the United Nations, they also put forward various conditions.

The British notification stated, "If the Secretary-General can confirm that the Egyptian government and the Israeli government have unconditionally accepted the ceasefire, and that the international force to be established will be capable of guaranteeing and supervising the implementation of the objectives stipulated in the implementation clauses of the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly on November 2nd, the Queen's government will agree to cease further military operations."

At the same time, this notification also revealed the plans of Britain and France to continue stationing their troops in the area along the canal under the pretext of "clearing obstacles in the canal." The notification stated: "Clearing the obstacles in the canal and its entrances is an extremely urgent matter that is beneficial to world shipping and trade. British and French forces have the equipment to carry out this task, and the Queen's government suggests that the technical personnel accompanying the British and French forces immediately begin this work."

The notification said: "Before confirming the above points, the Queen's government will order its troops to cease fire at midnight tonight (the 6th), unless they are attacked first." The content of the French notification to the United Nations was essentially the same as the British notification.

The notifications from Britain and France made no mention of the United Nations Emergency Assembly's demand for the withdrawal of the invading forces from Egypt, and did not provide any indication of preparing to withdraw from the Egyptian territory they had occupied, including part of the Suez Canal area. It is particularly noteworthy that the French official spokesperson's explanation of the British and French decision on the ceasefire issue. This spokesperson emphasized that British and French troops would continue to remain in the canal area until Egypt "fully accepts" the ceasefire conditions and the United Nations international force is established. In this regard, France has simultaneously proposed convening a Security Council meeting in its notification to the United Nations to "draft clear ceasefire conditions and resolve the Middle East issue." The French spokesperson also said that the reason why Britain and France considered implementing a ceasefire was because they believed that through the current military operations, their original goal of "depriving Egypt of control and management of the Suez Canal" had been "achieved."

At the same time, just before the announced ceasefire deadline of Britain and France was about to arrive, the British and French aggressor troops were launching particularly fierce attacks and offensives against important strongholds along the Suez Canal. Egyptian Representative to the United Nations, Loutfi, in a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General published at 18:15 Greenwich time on the 6th, sternly condemned the criminal act of Britain and France for making a "ceasefire" gesture on the one hand, while intensifying armed attacks on the other. The letter said: "Port Said is fighting heroically and has not, as the British representative said, 'been ordered' to cease fire.

"Cairo, Alexandria, Ismailia, Suez, and Port Said, as well as many other cities and civilians, have been and are still being subjected to fierce bombardments—this violates the basic principles of humanity—since yesterday, these bombardments have harmed the lives of thousands upon thousands of innocent civilians; this is also completely contrary to the statement by the United Kingdom representative that 'an order has been issued to immediately cease all bombardments against the entirety of Egypt.'"

This newspaper reporter Pan Fei, London, 7th urgent telegram. Last night, Prime Minister Eden announced in the House of Commons that Britain had accepted the ceasefire. Just the day before, Eden had claimed that Britain would continue its war of aggression against Egypt. This dramatic shift is the result of the struggle of peace-loving countries and people, especially the British people. At the same time, almost all British newspapers pointed out that Soviet Minister of the Council of Ministers Bulganin's letter played a decisive role.

It is said that when the text of the letter from Moscow was received, Mr. Eden was hurriedly called out of bed. Then, the exchange of telegrams began between the Atlantic and the English Channel. After that, there was a lengthy and tense cabinet meeting. When the Queen's speech was read in Parliament, Eden and Lloyd were not present.

The "Manchester Guardian" asked in its editorial, what prompted the Prime Minister to change his mind? He has indeed changed, because he accepted yesterday what he refused to accept on Monday. The editorial answered that it is very likely that Russia's tough and meaningful warning had something to do with this shift.

Secondly, a nationwide anti-war movement in Britain is growing. Following Sunday's mass rally in London, mass rallies were held successively in major towns and cities. Workers are at the forefront of the movement. New calls for strong action have been heard across the country. Yesterday afternoon, in Crawley, a newly emerging industrial city in southern England, workers took the lead in taking strong action. They put down their tools and walked out of the factories.

Discontent with the Conservative government is rapidly spreading among people of all walks of life. The danger of deteriorating economic conditions looms. The Ministry of Food has announced that as a result of the crisis, the prices of daily necessities are likely to rise. This is why people called last week the darkest week, and more and more people are joining the anti-war movement.

Third, facing the prospect of defeat in a shameful war, and the universal indignation of the people of the world, as well as the opposition of the British people, a crisis and division appeared within the ruling group. The resignation of Foreign Office Minister of State Nutting demonstrates the confusion among Conservative leaders. Even newspapers that were pro-Conservative a few days ago have begun to attack the actions of the Conservative government.

It is because of all these factors that the Eden government had to stop its adventurous war and accept an immediate ceasefire in Egypt. However, to completely stop the aggression and restore peace in the Middle East, a arduous struggle is still required.

### 在全世界坚决反对和苏联严重警告下  英法被迫宣布停火  埃及驻联合国代表严斥英法一面宣布“停火”一面加紧进攻

    在全世界坚决反对和苏联严重警告下
    英法被迫宣布停火
    埃及驻联合国代表严斥英法一面宣布“停火”一面加紧进攻
    新华社7日讯　英法两国政府在11月6日晚间宣布，已经下令它们进攻埃及的武装部队在6日午夜实行停火，“除非它们遭到（对方的）攻击”。英法两国关于停火问题的通知同一天由联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德加以公布。
    这个决定是在联合国大会紧急会议一再要求各方立即停火和苏联对英法侵略提出严重警告的情况下，英法两国经过紧急商谈以后共同作出的。英法两国在它们给联合国的通知中虽然表示准备实行停火，但是同时又提出了种种条件。
    英国的通知说，“如果秘书长能够证实埃及政府和以色列政府已经无条件地接受了停火，而将要成立的国际部队将有能力保证和监督联合国大会11月2日通过的决议的实施条款中所规定的目标的实现，女王政府将同意停止进一步的军事行动。”
    同时，这个通知还透露了英法两国在“清除运河障碍物”的借口下，准备把他们的军队继续驻扎在沿运河区域的计划。通知说：“清除运河中和它的入口处的障碍物，是有利于世界航运和贸易的极为急迫的事情。英国和法国的部队有执行这个任务的装备，女王政府建议英法部队的随军技术人员立即开始进行这件工作。”
    通知说：“在证实以上各点以前，女王政府将命令它的部队在今晚（六日）午夜时停火，除非它们先受到攻击。”法国给联合国的通知和英国的通知的内容实质上完全一样。
    英法两国的通知完全不提联合国紧急大会关于把侵略部队撤出埃及的要求，并且没有提供任何准备退出它们所侵占的包括一部分苏伊士运河地区在内的埃及领土的迹象。特别值得注意的是，法国官方发言人对英法关于停火问题决定所作的解释。这个发言人强调，在埃及“完全接受”停火条件和联合国国际部队成立以前，英法军队将继续留在运河地区。在这方面，法国已经在它的给联合国的通知中同时提出要求召开安全理事会会议来“起草明确的停火条件和解决中东问题”的建议。这个法国发言人还说，英法之所以考虑到实行停火，是因为它们认为通过目前的军事行动，它们原有的“剥夺埃及对苏伊士运河方面的控制和管理”的目的已经“达到”。
    同时，就在英法所宣布的停火生效期限即将到来以前，英法侵略军还在对苏伊士运河沿岸重要据点展开特别猛烈的袭击和进攻。埃及驻联合国代表卢特菲在6日格林威治时间十八点十五分公布的给联合国秘书长的一封信里严厉斥责英法一面作出“停火”姿态，一面又加紧武装进攻的罪恶行径。这封信说：“塞得港正在英勇地战斗着，并没有像英国代表所说的‘已经下令’停火。
    “开罗、亚历山大港、伊士美利亚、苏伊士和塞得港以及许多其它城市和平民已经受到并且现在还在受到猛烈的轰炸——这是违反人道的基本原则的——从昨天以来，这些轰炸使成千上万的无辜平民的生命受到伤害；这也是和联合王国代表所说‘已经下令立刻停止对整个埃及的一切轰炸’的说法完全相反的。”
    本报记者潘非伦敦7日急电  昨夜艾登首相在下院宣布英国接受停火。就在前一天，艾登曾声称英国将继续进行侵埃战争。这一个戏剧性的转变，是爱好和平的国家和人民，首先是英国人民斗争的结果。同时几乎是全部英国报纸都指出这一点：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的信起了决定性作用。
    据说，当收到莫斯科来的信件文本时，艾登先生被从床上匆匆喊起来。接着在大西洋和英伦海峡之间开始了交换电讯。之后，是冗长而又紧张的内阁会议。女皇的演说词在议会里宣读的时候，艾登和劳埃德都没有出席。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”在它的社论里问道，是什么促使首相回心转意的呢？他确实是改变了，因为他昨天接受了他在星期一所拒绝接受的东西。社论回答说，俄国的强硬而又意味深长的警告跟这个转变有些关系，这是很可能的。
    其次，在英国一个全国性的制止战争的运动正在日益高涨。继星期日的伦敦群众大会之后，在各大城镇相继举行了群众大会。工人在运动中站在最前列。全国各地响起了采取有力行动的新呼声。昨天下午，在南英格兰新兴工业城市克劳里，工人们率先采取了有力的行动。他们放下了工具，走出了工厂。
    对保守党政府的不满正迅速地在各阶层人民当中蔓延开来。经济状况恶化的危险隐约在望。粮食部已宣布，由于危机的结果，日用必需品的价格很可能上涨。这就是人民所以把上星期叫做最黑暗的一周，并且愈来愈多的人参加反对战争运动的缘故。
    第三，由于面临着在一场可耻的战争中失败的前景，和全世界人民的普遍愤慨，以及英国人民的反对，统治集团中呈现了危机和分裂。外交部国务大臣纳丁的辞职表现出在保守党领导人物当中的混乱。连几天前还是亲保守党的报纸，也开始攻击保守党政府的行动了。
    正是由于这一切因素，艾登政府才不得不停止其冒险战争和接受立即在埃及停火。但是要想彻底制止侵略，恢复在中东的和平，仍然需要进行艰苦的斗争。
