The talks held in Moscow between the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Government delegation, and the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Government delegation of the Polish People's Republic, concluded successfully on November 18. In the joint statement issued at the end of the talks, the leaders of the Soviet Union and Poland expressed unanimous views on a number of major international issues and a common determination to safeguard world peace. Furthermore, based on the Marxist-Leninist principle of equality among all peoples, they made many important decisions regarding the friendly relations between the two countries.

These talks embodied the fraternal relations of mutual respect, mutual trust, and mutual assistance between socialist countries, and embodied the necessary principles for relations between socialist countries put forward by the Soviet government in its declaration of October 30, namely, complete equality, respect of territorial integrity, respect for national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. Comrade Gomulka said in his speech on November 18: "The course and outcome of our talks with the Soviet side fully confirm that the Soviet government's declaration of October 30 is not just empty words, but an important factor that is now concretely manifested in the relations established between Poland and the Soviet Union, and between the Polish United Workers' Party, and, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on the basis of completely equal socialist principles." Some clouds between the two countries and two parties have dissipated, and the sunshine of further cooperation has shone through. All those who care about the international socialist cause and world peace will feel gratified by this.

During the negotiations, great attention was paid to the issue of economic relations between the two countries. Both sides resolved to develop economic cooperation between the two countries in the future on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and fraternal mutual assistance. The Soviet Union decided to supply Poland with 1.4 million tons of grain on credit in 1957, which is a huge assistance to the Polish people. In addition, the Soviet Union also agreed to lend Poland a loan of 700 million rubles. In the past few years, the Soviet Union has also granted Poland considerable loans. Now, according to the consultations between the two countries, the Soviet loans that Poland has used up to November 1 this year are considered to have been repaid, in order to compensate for the shortfall in the proceeds from Poland's sale of coal to the Soviet Union from 1946 to 1953.

The joint statement emphasized the importance of the Soviet-Polish alliance, in which both countries have equal interests. Considering the current international situation, the Soviet Union and Poland believe that it is appropriate for Soviet troops to remain temporarily stationed in Poland. As everyone knows, the imperialist camp headed by the United States has never ceased its subversive activities against socialist countries, and in recent times, these activities have become even more blatant and rampant. The North Atlantic aggressive bloc has established many military bases surrounding the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, targeting these countries. Revanchist militarist forces have already been rearmed in West Germany, seriously threatening the security of Poland and the whole of Europe. Not long ago, West German Chancellor Adenauer nakedly stated that "Germany will never give up its claim to the German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line, which are now controlled by the Polish government." Under these circumstances, the continued presence of Soviet troops in Poland is obviously of great importance for defending Poland's independence and the security of its western border, for defending Poland's socialist construction and the people's peaceful life, and for defending the peace of the whole of Europe. Anyone who has a sufficient assessment of the current situation will clearly realize that as long as the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and its military bases exist, the military cooperation and joint measures taken by socialist countries to ensure collective security cannot be dispensed with for a single day.

But the significance of the Soviet-Polish talks goes far beyond this.

One of the major international significances of the Soviet-Polish talks is that it has set a vivid example for the correct relations between socialist countries. The relations between socialist countries must conform to the principles of complete equality, respect for the inviolability of territory, respect for national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs; they must conform to the principles of solidarity, friendship, mutual benefit and mutual assistance, jointly promoting the economic upsurge of all countries, and jointly opposing imperialist aggression. However, the establishment of these principles does not mean that mistakes that violate these principles will not occur. Errors have existed in the past and exist now, and will not be completely absent in the future. The question is how to deal with these errors, whether these errors can be corrected in a timely and resolute manner, so that the influence of the errors can be more easily eliminated without being expanded. The Soviet-Polish talks prove that errors in the relations between socialist countries must be corrected, and can be completely corrected. This fact will greatly strengthen the faith of the people of socialist countries and socialists around the world in internationalism. In the future, among socialist countries, as long as the larger countries pay attention to opposing the errors of great-power chauvinism (which is the main thing), and the smaller countries pay attention to opposing the errors of nationalism (which is also necessary), then the unity and friendship among socialist countries on the basis of equality will inevitably be further consolidated and developed.

The Soviet-Polish talks are a great encouragement to the Soviet and Polish peoples, because they have laid a new and solid foundation for the friendly relations between the two countries, and such friendly relations are indispensable for the national security and people's happiness of the Soviet Union and Poland. This is also an encouragement to the people of other socialist countries, because the broad masses of the people of socialist countries are closely concerned about the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Poland, and hope that such friendly relations can continue to develop. The Soviet-Polish talks will have a positive impact on the Hungarian people, not only because the Soviet Union and Poland have expressed a common understanding of the situation in Hungary, but also because the Hungarian people can understand the truth about Soviet policy from the results of the Soviet-Polish talks. The Hungarian people can see that the Soviet Union is indeed pursuing a policy of equality and friendly mutual assistance towards the various People's Democratic countries, and not conquest, aggression, and plunder; what the imperialist propaganda machine says is just rumor and slander. If there have been any incorrect aspects in the relationship between the Soviet Union and Hungary in the past, the Soviet Union will resolutely correct them, just as it did for the Polish comrades, and strive to eliminate the impact of those errors. The Hungarian people who have doubts about Soviet policy, as well as all the kind and upright people around the world who care about the Hungarian events, can also see from the results of the Soviet-Polish talks that the actions of the Soviet army in Hungary are only to assist the socialist cause in Hungary, and there is absolutely no other purpose; as long as the subversive forces of imperialism in Hungary are eliminated and order in Hungary is completely restored, the Soviet government and the Hungarian government will definitely hold completely equal talks similar to the Soviet-Polish talks, and will definitely make arrangements for the issue of the Soviet army in Hungary that are fully in line with the interests of Hungarian independence and sovereignty.

Imperialism and the reactionary forces of the world are trying to use the events that have recently occurred in Eastern Europe to destroy the socialist camp and destroy the socialist movements in various countries. This situation reminds us of the old saying "we're all in the same boat in stormy weather". All socialist countries, all socialist parties, and all socialists in the world are sitting in a big boat, and must brave the storm to reach the victorious shore. With a powerful enemy in front of us, our socialist ranks can only achieve the great common goal if we earnestly strengthen unity between countries, between parties, within countries, and within parties. Doing things that are conducive to unity, saying things that are conducive to unity, resolving all misunderstandings and differences through consultation on the premise of taking the overall situation into account and subordinating to the overall interests, and not taking rash, crude, uncompromising, and reckless steps to harm the unity of the international socialist cause, and not instigating internal conflicts and divisions – this is the approach that can be welcomed and can win people's hearts. The Soviet-Polish talks show that many misunderstandings and differences between Marxists can indeed be eliminated or reduced on the basis of unity, through consultation involving mutual understanding and mutual concession, and through necessary criticism and self-criticism. We hope that the socialist forces around the world will continue to develop this atmosphere, cherish unity, and strengthen unity.

### 苏波会谈的国际意义

    苏波会谈的国际意义
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府代表团同波兰统一工人党中央委员会和波兰人民共和国政府代表团在莫斯科所举行的会谈，已经在11月18日圆满结束了。在双方会谈结束时发表的联合声明中，苏波两国领导人表示了对于当前一些重大国际问题的一致看法和维护世界和平的共同决心，并且根据马克思列宁主义的各国人民平等的原则，就两国的友好关系问题作出了许多重要的决定。
    这次会谈体现了社会主义国家之间互相尊重、互相信任和互相帮助的兄弟般的关系，体现了苏联政府在10月30日宣言中所提出的社会主义国家相互关系中必要的原则，这就是：完全平等，尊重领土的不可侵犯性，尊重国家独立和主权，互不干涉内政。哥穆尔卡同志在11月18日的讲话中说：“我们同苏联方面举行会谈的经过和成果都充分地证实，苏联政府1956年10月30日的宣言并不是空话，而是一种重要的因素，这个因素现在已经具体地表现在波兰和苏联之间以及波兰统一工人党和苏联共产党之间在完全平等的社会主义原则基础上建立的关系上。”苏波两国和两党之间的一些阴云消散了，进一步合作的阳光照耀了起来。所有关心国际社会主义事业和关心世界和平的人们，对此都会感觉欣慰。
    在谈判过程中，两国之间的经济关系问题受到了很大的注意。双方决心今后在平等互利和兄弟互助的基础上发展两国的经济合作。苏联决定以赊卖的方式在1957年对波兰供应一百四十万吨谷物，这是对波兰人民的巨大援助。此外，苏联还同意贷给波兰为数七亿卢布的贷款。在过去几年内，苏联也曾贷给波兰相当多的贷款。现在，根据两国的协商，到今年11月1日为止，波兰已经动用了的苏联贷款被认为已经偿还，以便补偿1946年到1953年间波兰向苏联售煤所得价款的不足之处。
    联合声明强调了同苏波有同等利害关系的苏波联盟的重要性。由于考虑到当前的国际局势，苏波两国认为，苏联军队暂时驻留在波兰境内是适宜的。大家知道，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营从来没有停止过对于社会主义各国的颠复活动，而在最近期间，这种活动是更加露骨、更加猖狂了。北大西洋侵略集团在苏联和人民民主国家的外围，建立了许多针对着这些国家的军事基地。复仇主义的军国主义势力已经在西德被重新武装起来，严重地威胁着波兰和整个欧洲的安全。就在不久以前，西德总理阿登纳还赤裸裸地表示过，“德国永远不会放弃对现在被波兰政府控制着的奥得—尼斯河分界线以东的德国领土的要求。”在这种情况之下，苏联军队留驻在波兰境内，对于保卫波兰的独立和西部边疆的安全，对于保卫波兰的社会主义建设和人民的和平生活，以及对于保卫整个欧洲的和平，显然具有重大的作用。每一个对当前局势有足够估计的人，都会清醒地认识到，只要北大西洋侵略集团和它的军事基地存在一天，社会主义各国为了保障集体安全而采取的军事合作和联合措施，就一天也不能缺少。
    但是苏波会谈的意义远不以此为限。
    苏波会谈的重大国际意义之一，是它为社会主义各国之间的正确关系作出了一个生动的榜样。社会主义各国之间的关系必须符合于完全平等、尊重领土的不可侵犯性、尊重国家独立和主权、互不干涉内政的原则，必须符合于团结友好、互利互助、共同促进各国经济高涨、共同反对帝国主义侵略的原则。但是确立了这些原则，不等于不会发生违背这些原则的错误，错误无论在过去和现在都是有的，将来也不会完全没有。问题是在怎样对待这些错误，能否及时地坚决地纠正这些错误，以便使错误的影响比较容易消除而不致扩大。苏波会谈证明，社会主义各国相互关系中的错误是必须纠正的，也是完全可以纠正的。这个事实，一定会大大加强社会主义各国的人民和全世界社会主义者对于国际主义的信念。今后，在社会主义各国之间，只要较大的国家注意反对大国主义的错误（这是主要的），而较小的国家注意反对民族主义的错误（这也是必需的），那么，社会主义各国之间在平等基础上的团结和友谊，必然能够得到进一步的巩固和发展。
    苏波会谈对于苏联人民和波兰人民是巨大的鼓舞，因为它给苏波两国的友好关系从新奠定了坚固的基础，而这种友好关系对于苏波两国的国家安全和人民幸福是不可缺少的。这同样也是对其他社会主义国家的人民的鼓舞，因为社会主义各国的广大人民都密切关心苏波两国和两国人民的友好关系，希望这种友好关系能够继续发展。苏波会谈对于匈牙利人民将有良好的影响，这不但因为苏波两国对匈牙利局势表示了共同的认识，而且因为匈牙利人民可以从苏波会谈的结果，认清苏联政策的真相。匈牙利人民可以看出：苏联对于各人民民主国家所实行的果然是平等和友好互助的政策，而不是征服、侵略和掠夺；帝国主义宣传机关所说的，只是造谣污蔑罢了。苏联和匈牙利之间的关系在过去有什么不正确的地方，苏联也会像对波兰同志所作的那样，坚决地加以纠正，努力消除那些错误所产生的影响。对于苏联政策有所疑虑的匈牙利人民，以及全世界关心匈牙利事件的一切善良正直的人士，还可以从苏波会谈的结果看出：苏联军队在匈牙利的行动，仅仅是为了援助匈牙利的社会主义事业，决没有任何其他目的；只要帝国主义在匈牙利的颠复势力消灭、匈牙利秩序完全恢复以后，苏联政府和匈牙利政府一定会举行类似苏波会谈的完全平等的会谈，对于在匈牙利的苏军问题一定会作出完全符合匈牙利独立和主权的利益的安排。
    帝国主义和全世界反动势力都正在力图利用最近在东欧发生的事件摧毁社会主义阵营，摧毁世界各国的社会主义运动。这种情况使我们想起“风雨同舟”的古话。全世界一切社会主义国家，一切社会主义政党，一切社会主义者，都是坐在一只大船上，要迎着暴风雨达到胜利的彼岸。大敌当前，我们社会主义的队伍只有在国与国之间，在党与党之间，在国家内部和党的内部，认真地加强团结，才能达到伟大的共同的目的。作有利于团结的事，说有利于团结的话，一切误解和分歧都在顾全大局、服从总的利益的前提下协商解决，而不采取轻率的、粗暴的、不留余地的和不计后果的步骤损害国际社会主义事业的团结，而不鼓动内部的冲突和分裂，——这才是能够受欢迎、能够得人心的方针。苏波会谈表明，马克思主义者之间的许多误解和分歧，确是可以在团结的基础上，经过互相谅解互相忍让的协商，也经过必要的批评和自我批评，加以消除或者缩小的。我们希望全世界的社会主义力量继续发展这个气氛，珍视团结，加强团结。
