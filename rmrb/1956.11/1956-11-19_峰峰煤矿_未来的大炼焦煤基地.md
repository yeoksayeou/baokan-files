Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 18th. The Fengfeng Coal Mine in southern Hebei Province is being gradually built into one of China's largest coking coal bases. According to preliminary plans, from now until 1967, several new pairs of mine shafts will be started each year at this mine.

Currently, the Fengfeng mining area presents a busy construction scene everywhere. Thousands of construction workers are stepping up the construction of three pairs of new mine shafts and the renovation of an existing production mine shaft. In addition, two pairs of large vertical shafts have already begun or are about to begin construction preparation work, and will be started at the end of this year and next year. These newly built mine shafts, except for one pair that is being built with Soviet assistance, are all designed by China itself according to the latest technical standards.

In order to meet the needs of mine construction, the original power plant in this mining area is being expanded, and another modern thermal power plant will begin construction next year. Of the three large-scale coal washing plants planned, the ancillary projects for two coal washing plants have already started construction. A factory that produces rock powder for preventing underground coal dust explosions is about to install equipment. The railway special line is under intense roadbed construction and the tracks can be laid next year.

With the development of mine construction, worker villages are being rapidly built in the center of the mining area. Roadsides that were barren a few months ago are now being constructed with worker housing that can accommodate more than 20,000 people. Newly built schools, hospitals, sanatoriums, cultural palaces, cinemas, and department stores have all been completed.

    峰峰煤矿——未来的大炼焦煤基地
    新华社保定18日电　河北省南部的峰峰煤矿，正在逐步建设成为我国最大的炼焦煤基地之一。按照初步制定的规划，这个矿从现在起到1967年为止，每年都将有几对新的矿井开工建设。
    现在，峰峰矿区到处呈现着一片繁忙的建设景象。数千名建设者正在加紧建设三对新的矿井和改建一对原有生产矿井。另有两对大型竖井也已经开始和将要开始进行施工准备工作，今年年底和明年将要动工兴建。这些新建的矿井，除了其中一对是苏联帮助建设的以外，其余都是我国自己按照最新的技术标准设计的。
    为了适应矿井建设的需要，这个矿区原有的电厂正在扩建，并且将在明年开始建设另一座近代化的热电厂。规划中规定要建设的三座规模宏大的洗煤厂，有两座洗煤厂的附属工程已经开始施工。一座生产预防井下煤尘爆炸用的岩粉的工厂，最近就要安装设备。铁路专线正在紧张的修筑路基，明年就可以铺好轨道。
    随着矿井建设的发展，在矿区的中心，一座座的工人村镇正在迅速建成。几个月前还是一片荒野的公路两旁，正在建造可以供给二万多人居住的工人住宅。新盖的学校、医院、疗养院、文化宫、电影院和百货公司等，都已经落成。
