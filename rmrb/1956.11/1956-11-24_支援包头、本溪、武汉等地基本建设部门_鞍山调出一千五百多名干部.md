Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 23rd. In the past ten and a half months, the Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation has transferred more than 1,500 experienced management and technical cadres to support basic construction departments in Baotou, Benxi, Wuhan, and other places.

This company transferred these cadres under the condition of even more arduous construction tasks. The personnel of many functional departments under it have been reduced by one-third to one-half compared with last year, but the labor intensity has not increased, because many complicated work procedures and unnecessary systems have been eliminated. For example, the cadre department had a total of 61 people last year, but now there are only 27 people. Due to the clear division of labor, the enthusiasm of the cadres has been stimulated, and the phenomenon of work delays and shirking responsibility has been greatly reduced.

In the past few years, this company has systematically adopted many methods such as cadre training, running night universities, spare-time schools, and technical lectures to cultivate and improve the working ability of cadres. Many jobs that used to be undertaken by two or three people can now be done by one person. Several hundred university graduates of 1952 and experienced veteran workers have been promoted to leadership positions this year to replace the transferred cadres.

    支援包头、本溪、武汉等地基本建设部门
    鞍山调出一千五百多名干部
    新华社鞍山23日电　在过去十个半月中，鞍山冶金建筑总公司抽调出一千五百多名有经验的管理干部和技术干部，支援包头、本溪、武汉等地的基本建设部门。
    这个公司是在建设任务更繁重的情况下调出这些干部的。现在它所属的许多职能机构的人员，比去年减少了三分之一到二分之一，但是劳动强度并未增加，原因是取消了许多繁杂的工作手续和不必要的制度。例如干部处去年共有六十一人，现在只有二十七人，由于分工明确，激发了干部的积极性，工作拖延推诿的现象大大减少。
    这个公司在过去几年中，有计划地采取干部轮训、开办夜大学、业余学校、技术讲座等许多方式，培养提高了干部的工作能力。有很多工作过去是两三个人才担负起来，现在只要一个人就够了。几百名1952年毕业的大学生和有工作经验的老工人，今年已经被提拔到领导岗位上来，代替调出的干部。
