    中国出口商品展览会已接待观众二十万人
    新华社广州19日电　中国出口商品展览会开幕十天来已接待了二十万零五千多个参观者。现在还有七十一万多人登记要求参观。
    在参观的人群中，有广州和附近各县的各界人民，港澳同胞和海外华侨，亚非地区和欧洲部分国家的商人。他们对展览会丰富多采的国产新商品很感兴趣。澳门著名的工商界人士姚景槐说：参观后，我感到祖国的进步一日千里，内心充满了自豪感。姚景槐对澳门“大众报”记者说，“在展览会中，各种商品都比以前进步。其中以解放牌汽车、火车头、六千瓩的汽轮发电机等最引人注目。各种纺织品、工业馆中的机器、各种日用品，都使人想一看再看”。
    外国商人对展览会也很称赞。一位曾在中国经商二十多年的外国商人说：“展出的商品包罗万象。从来没有想到中国能生产这么多的货品，并且能够将这些货物出口”。
    据新华社广州19日电　今天是中国出口商品展览会开幕后的第十天，大会先后已经作了将近一千笔生意，成交总数突破了五百万英镑。
    大会成交的一千多种商品中，除了棉布、松香、桂皮、丝、柑橘等传统的主要出口商品外，还有第一次出口的大片瓦、大橘饼、鱼脯松等商品。欧洲的商人头一回买了我国的药酒、油毛毡和小锁头。印度尼西亚和柬埔寨的商人也对挂销和厂丝感到兴趣。十天内，糖果饼干和鸡毛帚等小商品也卖了五十多万美元。
    这次和我国交易的有二百多个商户。他们来自亚非地区和欧洲十四个国家，还有港澳工商界人士。过去很少和我国贸易往来的寮国商人，这次也来了，并且第一次购买了一批松香、布匹、铁钉和啤酒。商人们对大会的交易相当满意。
