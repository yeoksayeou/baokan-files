    Yuxi County Formulates Specific Measures
    to Manage the Public Property of Agricultural Cooperatives
    (Reported by this newspaper) Yuxi County, Yunnan, recently discovered many cases of poor public property management during the "Ten Checks and Ten Comparisons" campaign carried out in various cooperatives. After research by the Yuxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in addition to educating members to care about collective interests and cherish public property, it plans to strengthen the management of agricultural cooperative public property in the following aspects: (1) Each cooperative's public property must have a sound management system. From now on, all public property should be sorted, itemized, and registered by category. (2) Select people with a strong sense of responsibility and concern for public property to be fixed as custodians. Strictly implement the post-use handover and acceptance system. Give custodians reasonable labor remuneration. (3) In livestock breeding management, in addition to strengthening political and ideological education for breeders, a breeding management system should be formulated that rewards work and overproduction. This is to ensure the reproduction of the cooperative's livestock and prevent loss of public property.

    玉溪县制定具体办法
    管理农业社的公共财产
    本报讯　云南玉溪县最近在各社开展的“十查十比”中，发现很多对公共财产管理不好的现象。中共玉溪县委会经研究后，除教育社员关心集体利益，爱护公共财产外，拟从以下几个方面来加强农业社公共财产的管理：（一）每个社的公共财产须有健全的管理制度。从现在起，分门别类的把所有公共财产逐件清理，造册登记。（二）选择责任心比较强对公共财产关心的人固定为保管员。严格执行用后交接验收制度。对保管员给以合理的劳动报酬。（三）牲畜饲养管理，除对饲养员加强政治思想教育外，应制定按劳取酬、超产奖励的饲养管理制度。以确保社的牲畜繁殖和公共财产不受损失。
