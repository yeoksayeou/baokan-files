The Day of Victory for the Albanian People
Albanian Writer, Republic Prize Winner S. Spahiu

November 29, 1944, after five years of heroic and unprecedented struggle, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Communist Party (now the Albanian Labor Party) and with the help of the Soviet army, were liberated from the rule of Italian fascists, German Nazis, and domestic feudal bourgeoisie. For centuries, our people have been fighting for freedom. Our peasants, like the Chinese peasants, have shed blood and sacrificed themselves to obtain land. However, it was not until twelve years ago today that the people truly became masters of their own destiny, becoming the true owners of the motherland's material and spiritual wealth.

The feudal bourgeois system and Nazi rule left us with poverty and ignorance. 90% of the people were illiterate. The vast majority of cities were turned into ruins. We had gloriously shed blood for freedom, and after 1944, the great spirit shown in the national liberation struggle turned into boundless enthusiasm for labor, which is the foundation for building socialism.

In Albania, everything had to start from scratch. For the first time, workers built their own factories, and peasants cultivated freely on their own land. For the first time, we heard the roar of trains in our country, and for the first time, we used tractors to cultivate our fields. For the first time, we founded drama and opera houses, and for the first time, we established institutions of higher learning, where the children of workers and peasants studied. In short, for every great economic and cultural construction, the Albanian people should say: "This is the first time." The great economic, political, cultural, and social reforms have significantly changed the face of Albania. At the end of the first five-year plan in 1955, our motherland had transformed from a backward agricultural country into a progressive industrial and agricultural country, and from a culturally backward country into a cultured country. Scientific, literary, and artistic fields that did not exist in the past have now achieved unprecedented development. We have eliminated illiteracy among people under the age of forty.

If we express the victory of the first five-year plan in numbers, we can see that, compared to 1938 (the last year of feudal bourgeois rule in our country), the total industrial output increased by ten and a half times, grain production increased by 67%, national income increased by 70%, real wages of workers increased by 20%, and farmers' income increased by 35%.

Our Party, which had cultivated countless freedom fighters in the past, is now cultivating countless heroes and fighters for building socialism. The Soviet Union helped us win freedom, and today, in order to make our motherland prosperous and happy, the Soviet Union has given us great assistance in our economic construction, and other people's democratic countries have also given us fraternal aid. The great Chinese people have been our dearest brothers since 1949. We—one million four hundred thousand people on the Adriatic coast—are building a new life today with the material and spiritual assistance of the nine hundred million builders of the socialist camp.

With the great assistance of the socialist camp, our people are following the instructions of the Third Congress of the Albanian Labor Party held in May this year, and are carrying out the construction of the second five-year plan (1956-1960). The second five-year plan has opened up a new and important stage for further consolidating our people's democratic system and ensuring the happiness of the people. Compared with the first five-year plan, the total industrial output will increase by 92%. Grain production in 1960 will increase by 46% compared to 1955, and by 243% compared to 1938. By the end of the second five-year plan (1960), agricultural cooperativization will be completed in all plain and hilly areas, and if mutual aid groups are included, their cultivated area will account for more than 85% of the country's cultivated area. Education, literature, science, and art will also have greater development than in the first five-year plan.

The completion of the second five-year plan will be a great victory for our country's socialist construction and for further consolidating and developing the socialist relations between the countries of the socialist camp.

Under the wise leadership of the Party, the entire Albanian people, led by the working class, are working enthusiastically and selflessly for brilliant new victories. They know that on this victorious road that began on November 29, 1944, they will certainly continue to receive fraternal and comprehensive assistance from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries. We are thousands of miles away from the People's Republic of China, but countless strands of friendship connect the hearts of our two peoples closely together. Our two peoples have suffered the same poverty and exploitation. Like you, we have suffered all kinds of oppression from the feudal bourgeoisie. Like you, we have carried out centuries of resolute struggle for freedom. Our two peoples have fought heroically against the enemy, and today we are both enthusiastically building socialism. Our people cherish the friendship between the Albanian and Chinese peoples as they protect their own eyes. Our people are proud and happy to have such dear and loyal friends as the great Chinese people. We are as infinitely excited about the achievements of the Chinese people as we are about our own.

Today, the Albanian people celebrate November 29—the 12th anniversary of liberation—with confidence in the victories they have achieved and in having such friends. (Special contribution to this newspaper)

    阿尔巴尼亚人民胜利的日子
    阿尔巴尼亚作家共和国奖金获得者  斯·斯巴修
    1944年11月29日，阿尔巴尼亚人民经过了五年英勇的史无前例的斗争，在阿尔巴尼亚共产党（现在的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党）的领导和苏联军队的帮助下，从意大利法西斯和德国纳粹以及国内封建资产阶级统治下获得了解放。几世纪来，我国人民就一直在为自由而斗争。我国农民也像中国农民一样为了获得土地而流血牺牲。可是，直到十二年前的今天，人民才真正当家作主，成了祖国物质和精神财富的真正主人。
    封建资产阶级制度和纳粹统治给我们留下来的是贫困和愚昧。90％的人民是文盲。绝大多数城市变成了废墟。我们曾为自由而光荣地流血斗争，而在1944年以后，在民族解放斗争中所表现的伟大精神就变成了对劳动的无限热忱，而这正是建设社会主义的基础。
    在阿尔巴尼亚一切都得从头开始。工人们第一次建筑起了自己的工厂，农民也是第一次在自由的土地上耕种。在我国第一次听到了火车的吼声，第一次用拖拉机来耕种我们的田地。我们第一次创办了话剧和歌剧院，第一次建立了高等学府，同时也是第一次有工人和农民的子弟在那儿学习。总之，对于每一个伟大的经济和文化建设，阿尔巴尼亚人民都应该说：“这是第一次”。经济、政治、文化和社会的伟大改革，显著地改变了阿尔巴尼亚的面貌。第一个五年计划末，1955年，我们的祖国已由一个落后的农业国变成了一个进步的工农业国家，已经从一个文化落后的国家变成了一个有文化的国家。过去所没有的科学、文学和艺术部门，今天都获得了空前的发展。我们已经扫除了四十岁以下的文盲。
    如果用数目字来表达第一个五年计划的胜利，那么我们可以看到：以1955年同1938年（封建资产阶级统治我国的最后一年）相比，工业总产量增加了十倍半，粮食产量增加了67％，国民收入增加了70％，工人实际工资提高了20％，农民的收入增加了35％。
    我们的党在过去曾培养出了无数的自由战士，今天它也培养了无数建设社会主义的英雄和战士。苏联曾帮助我们争得了自由，而今天为了使我们祖国繁荣和幸福，苏联在我国经济建设方面又给了我们很大的帮助，同时各人民民主国家也给了我们兄弟般的援助。伟大的中国人民从1949年以后就一直是我们最亲爱的兄弟。我们——在亚得里亚海边的一百四十万人民——在社会主义阵营九亿建设者的物质和精神的援助下，今天正在建设着新的生活。
    在社会主义阵营巨大的援助下，我国人民正遵循着今年5月间召开的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第三次代表大会的指示，进行着第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）的建设。第二个五年计划为进一步巩固我国人民民主制度和保证人民的幸福，开辟了一个新的重要的阶段。以第二个五年计划同第一个五年计划相比，工业总产量将增加92％。1960年的粮食产量将比1955年增加46％，为1938年的243％。到第二个五年计划末（1960年），在所有的平原地区和丘陵地区将完成农业合作化，如果包括互助组，其耕地面积将占全国耕地面积的85％以上。教育、文学、科学和艺术比第一个五年计划也将有更大的发展。
    第二个五年计划的完成，将是我国社会主义建设以及进一步巩固和发展社会主义阵营各国间社会主义关系的一个伟大的胜利。
    在党的英明领导下，以工人阶级为首的全体阿尔巴尼亚人民就是这样为了光辉灿烂的新胜利而热情地忘我地劳动着。他们知道，在这条从1944年11月29日开始的胜利道路上，今后也一定会得到苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家的兄弟般的全面的帮助。我们和中华人民共和国远隔万里，可是千丝万缕的友谊把我们两国人民的心紧紧地连接在一起。我们两国人民都曾遭受过同样的贫困和剥削。我们像你们一样受尽了封建资产阶级的压迫。我们和你们一样，为了争取自由曾经进行了几世纪坚决的斗争，我们两国人民都曾英勇地同敌人作过战，而今天我们又都在热情地建设社会主义。我国人民像保护眼珠一样地保护着阿中两国人民的友谊。我国人民因为有像伟大中国人民这样亲爱的忠实的朋友而感到自豪和高兴。我们对中国人民所获得的成就像对自己的成就一样感到无限兴奋。
    今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民以所取得的胜利、以自己有这样的朋友而满怀信心地来庆祝11月29日——解放十二周年纪念日。（本报特约稿）
