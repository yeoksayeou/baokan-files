Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 12th: The Shanghai Electromechanical Products Design Company, established this year, has already designed quite a few new machines. These include industrial single-arm gantry planers, ramie textile machines, agricultural fertilizer spreaders, potato harvesters, and casting sand mold making machines to support fraternal countries.

In the first half of the year, the company's designers designed an average of one new machine and thirty kinds of machine parts every two working days.

This company was established on the basis of the original Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Heavy Industry's Technology Department, and absorbed a group of technical personnel from private factories and society. It has now become a design team with 180 people. The design tasks have expanded from simply designing electromechanical products to recently conducting factory process design for six electromechanical factories.

    自己设计新机器
    新华社上海12日电　今年成立的上海市机电产品设计公司，已经设计出不少新机器。其中有工业用的单臂龙门刨床、苎麻纺织机，农业用的撒肥机、马铃薯收割机，和支援兄弟国家的铸件砂模造器机。
    上半年，这个公司的设计人员，平均每两个工作日，就设计出一种新机器和三十种机器配件。
    这个公司是在原上海市重工业局技术处的基础上，吸收了一批私营厂和社会上的技术人员成立的。现在已经成为一支拥有一百八十人的设计队伍。设计任务从过去单纯设计机电产品，扩大到最近为六个机电工厂进行工厂工艺设计。
