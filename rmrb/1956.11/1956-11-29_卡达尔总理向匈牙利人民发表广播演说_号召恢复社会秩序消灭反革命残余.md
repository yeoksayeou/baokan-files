Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 28th: Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government Premier Kadar delivered a radio address to the nation on the evening of the 26th from Budapest Radio.

    Remnants of Counter-Revolutionaries Cannot Escape the Fate of Being Eliminated

    Premier Kadar first addressed the issue of restoring socialist rule of law and social order. He said, "As you know, organized counter-revolutionary armed forces were eliminated in the days following November 4th. The remaining elements, divided into small groups, mainly harass Budapest, occasionally appearing in factories and attempting to intimidate workers with terror, forcing them to refuse to resume work. However, these remnants have also met the same fate. Now, after the end of the armed conflict, the task of maintaining and strengthening public security in the capital increasingly falls on the Hungarian revolutionary forces and police organs, and in the localities, increasingly on the police organs. It can be said that they are performing this extremely important task with increasing satisfaction. The search for and arrest of ordinary criminals released from prisons by the enemies of our system during this incident is also progressing successfully. Currently, the work of searching for and arresting lurking counter-revolutionaries and hostile elements and handing them over to the courts is also underway."

    "Based on the above situation, I believe it is necessary to clearly and unequivocally declare the following:

    Firstly, in order to maintain the order of the People's Republic and ensure the safety of the working people, the government believes that the primary task at present is to unhesitatingly search for, eliminate, and bring to justice all lurking counter-revolutionaries and all counter-revolutionary provocateurs and those who have committed general crimes. On this issue, we will not yield, nor is there room for negotiation, because doing so would be a crime against the people.

    Secondly, I once again unequivocally declare that we will practice and ensure that everyone abides by the promise made by the government in its appeal on November 4th, that is, no one will be held accountable for all workers who participated in the mass movement that began on October 23rd."

    "However, other problems have now arisen in restoring national order. While life is becoming more and more orderly in the vast majority of factories and institutions, anarchy and abuse of power have emerged in some places. This phenomenon should be stopped without delay. We must ensure that the workers' committees in all production enterprises carry out tasks within the scope of their legally prescribed powers. At the same time, we should resolutely stop the illegal activities carried out by some workers' committees that would cause serious damage to the national economy.

    The activities of most of the committees established in various ministries, agencies, and schools under various names are in a very anarchic state and hinder the work of agencies and schools. It is hoped that the leaders of agencies and schools will resolutely stop the activities of committees that hinder work.

    Finally, an indispensable condition for the complete restoration of order is that everyone must abide by the instructions of the appointed leaders who are responsible for the work (such as the leaders of government ministries and bureaus, the chairmen and secretaries of the executive committees of local conferences, the leaders of schools and factories, engineers and foremen, and all other responsible leaders)."

    Resolutely Promote the Democratization of Social Life and Restore the Rule of Law

    Kadar then emphasized that the government will resolutely promote the democratization of all social life, eradicate bureaucracy in government leadership and economic leadership, and strengthen the democratic nature of agencies, schools, and enterprises. However, democracy itself also includes the rule of law. The government will resolutely strive to ensure that all workers enjoy extensive democracy in the future, while exercising dictatorship over the enemy.

    He said, "Now that various major conditions are in place, we hope and strive to restore the rule of law as quickly and as perfectly as possible throughout the country and in all aspects of life. A week or two ago, in many places, armed counter-revolutionary terrorists intimidated honest citizens who hoped to resume work and strive to restore the rule of law. Fortunately, this situation has changed. However, all honest people who advocate resuming work and restoring order are still under the spiritual threat of saboteurs. The government firmly believes that if there are still people who should be under terror for a certain period of time in our country, these people should not be honest workers, peasants, intellectuals, and progressive democrats, but should be those who violate the law, fascist agitators, counter-revolutionaries, and enemies of our People's Republic."

    Almost All Enterprises Have Resumed Work; Peasants Have Never Stopped Working

    Kadar then discussed the issue of labor production. He said, "After about three weeks of strikes that paralyzed the country, almost all enterprises in our country are now starting to resume work. In this regard, I should especially mention and commend agricultural laborers. Among the peasants, whether they are cooperative members or individual farmers, none accepted the provocative call to stop working. Without any centralized leadership, they completed 80% to 90% of the autumn harvest. In industrial enterprises, commerce, and transportation, work has begun, but at present we cannot say that production is normal, and local and temporary strikes still occur from time to time, and these strikes cause serious losses. Although this wave of strikes is declining day by day, it has not completely stopped. There are two reasons for this phenomenon. First, the counter-revolutionary forces are still active behind the development of events, putting forward the most absurd demands, attempting to cause the most serious economic losses possible throughout the country, so that after economic difficulties, they can launch another attack on our democratic system. Second, in some places, good workers are not always able to clearly recognize that linking the resumption of work with demands that cannot be met temporarily harms their own interests."

    Government Will Be Reorganized and Strengthened After Life Returns to Normal

    Kadar continued, "According to the government's statement on November 4th, after life has completely returned to normal, we will reorganize the government and strengthen the government with communists, outstanding non-party members, and experts. The only requirement we have for non-party members is that they work on the basis of socialism and that they protect socialist achievements. We will not carry out any government reorganization as long as life has not completely returned to normal. We only hope that such a possibility will appear as soon as possible. However, we cannot do this under the pressure of counter-revolutionaries or under the pressure of good-natured workers who have gone astray. We have deeply learned the lessons of the Nagy government. The fight against counter-revolution must be done by crushing the counter-revolution, not by making concessions."

    "What was the situation of the Nagy government? Under the pressure of counter-revolution, a minister was replaced every hour. The government's activities were completely trapped in discussing and implementing these constantly changing demands. The government was unable to fulfill its actual responsibilities. The counter-revolution became stronger and stronger, and was progressing every hour."

    Kadar said that in some places, someone represents the workers and says that the workers will only work if all the workers' demands are met. Many of these demands are legitimate, but the problem is that these demands cannot be met at present. Our decision to raise wages has reached such a limit that inflation will occur beyond this limit. It is easy to talk about raising wages, and it is also easy to print banknotes, but we must never do this. No sensible person wants inflation, because the burden of inflation falls first on the shoulders of the workers. In order to meet all reasonable demands, there must be a foundation, and this foundation is created by labor. Therefore, production labor must be started immediately everywhere, first of all, arranging the production of coal and electricity."

    The Nagy Government Committed an Irreparable Mistake Against the People

    Kadar then spoke about Imre Nagy. He said, "I believe that this issue has already become a past historical issue, and our people will soon move beyond this issue on the agenda. The Nagy government and Nagy himself committed an irreparable mistake against the Hungarian people. In fact, due to its incompetence and numbness under the counter-revolutionary attack, he covered up and condoned the evil counter-revolutionary white terror. Even as a Communist Party member, he played an unforgivable role. If he was incompetent, he should have openly told everyone the truth and then resigned. He did not do this, but instead used his name to cover up this terror. Finally, on the morning of November 4th, he called for resistance against the Soviet army that was invited to stop the crimes of white terror, and after announcing on the radio that the government was still in its position, he picked up his briefcase and slipped out the small door to the Yugoslav embassy in Hungary to seek refuge. A few days later, through diplomatic channels, he expressed his hope to leave the territory of the Hungarian People's Republic. Considering the wishes of Nagy and his companions themselves, we made it possible for them to leave the territory of the Hungarian People's Republic."

    When the government of the Romanian People's Republic agreed to let Nagy go to Romania for refuge, Nagy left Hungary on November 23rd. Kadar said, "We have promised to exempt him from prosecution for his serious mistakes. We will honor this promise."

    Reiterates Opposition to UN Interference in Hungary's Internal Affairs

    Finally, Premier Kadar addressed the issue of UN interference in Hungary's internal affairs and the issue of the Soviet army. He said, "We believe that all the painful events that began on October 23rd are internal affairs of Hungary, and no one has the right to interfere in these matters. As for the withdrawal of the Soviet army, this is also an internal affair of Hungary, and legally speaking, this is clearly beyond dispute. The Soviet army is stationed on Hungarian territory based on a multilateral agreement between several countries, and they participated in the struggle at the request of the legitimate government of Hungary. With this assistance, the Soviet Union not only helped save the Hungarian people from counter-revolutionary terror, but also prevented the formation of a hotbed of war."

    Kadar said, "At present, only by relying on the Hungarian working people can we start work, restore order, consolidate the people's regime, and ensure a peaceful and creative life in our country. We have many wounds now, but we can and must heal these wounds. However, how long it will take for us to solve all social problems and problems related to national sovereignty depends on ourselves. Although the progressive forces of the world support us, everything still depends on our work."

### 卡达尔总理向匈牙利人民发表广播演说  号召恢复社会秩序消灭反革命残余

    卡达尔总理向匈牙利人民发表广播演说
    号召恢复社会秩序消灭反革命残余
    新华社布达佩斯28日电　匈牙利工农革命政府总理卡达尔26日晚在布达佩斯电台向全国人民发表了广播演说。
    残余反革命分子逃不掉被消灭的命运
    卡达尔总理首先谈到了恢复社会主义法制和社会秩序的问题。他说，大家知道，有组织的反革命武装力量在11月4日以后的几天内已经被消灭了。而残余的一部分则分成小股，主要在布达佩斯骚扰，不时在工厂中出现和试图用恐怖手段来恫吓工人、强迫他们拒绝复工。但是，这些残余分子也遭到了同样的命运。现在，在结束了武装冲突以后，维持和加强治安的任务在首都就越来越落到匈牙利革命部队和警察机关的身上，在地方上则越来越落到警察机关的身上。可以说，它们执行这项极为重要的任务的情况是日益令人满意的。对在这次事件中被我们制度的敌人从监狱中释放出来的普通罪犯的搜捕工作，也进行得很成功。现在，搜寻和逮捕潜伏下来的反革命分子和敌对分子并且把他们交给法院的工作也在进行中。
    根据上述情况，我认为有必要明确地、毫不含糊地声明如下：
    首先，为了维持人民共和国的秩序和保证劳动人民的安全，政府认为目前的首要任务是毫不迟疑地搜查、消灭和法办所有潜伏的反革命分子以及一切反革命挑衅者和犯了一般罪行的人。在这个问题上，我们决不退让，也没有谈判的余地，因为如果那样做将是对人民犯罪。
    其次，我再一次毫不含糊地声明，我们将实践并且使人人都遵守政府在11月4日的呼吁中所作出的诺言，即对于一切参加了10月23日开始的群众运动的劳动者将不予以追究。
    但是，在恢复国家秩序方面现在又出现了其他一些问题。当绝大部分工厂、机关中生活越来越有秩序的时候，有的地方却产生了无秩序和滥用职权的现象。应该毫不迟延地终止这种现象。我们必须保证使所有生产企业中的工人委员会实行法律规定的职权范围内的任务。同时应该坚决制止某些工人委员会所进行的会给国民经济带来严重损失的违法活动。
    在各个部、机关、学校中成立的各种各样名称的委员会中，大多数的活动都处于十分无政府状态，并且妨碍机关和学校的工作。希望机关和学校的领导人坚决制止那些阻碍工作的委员会的活动。
    最后，完全恢复秩序所必不可少的条件是：每个人都必须遵守被任命的要对工作负责的领导者（如政府各部和局的领导人，地方会议执行委员会主席和秘书，学校和工厂领导人，工程师和工长以及所有其他负责的领导人）的指示。
    坚决发扬社会生活的民主化　恢复法制
    卡达尔接着强调指出，政府将坚决发扬全部社会生活的民主化，要根除政府领导和经济领导中的官僚主义作风；加强机关、学校、企业的民主性质。但是，民主本身也包含着法制。政府将坚决努力在将来保证一切劳动者享有广泛的民主，同时要对敌人实行专政。
    他说，既然各种主要条件已经具备，我们希望而且努力争取在全国、在生活各方面尽快地而且尽可能完善地恢复法制。一两个星期之前，在许多地方，武装的反革命恐怖分子曾经恫吓希望复工和努力恢复法制的正直公民。幸而，这种局面已经改变了。但是，一切主张复工和恢复秩序的正直人们，目前还处在捣乱分子的精神威胁之下。政府坚决认为：假如说在我国还有人应该在一定的时期内处于恐怖之下，这种人不应该是正直的工人、农民、知识分子和进步民主人士，而应该是破坏法律的人、法西斯鼓动者和反革命分子以及我们人民共和国的敌人。
    几乎全部企业开始复工　农民从未停止工作
    卡达尔接着谈到劳动生产问题。他说，在大约三个星期的罢工使得全国瘫痪之后，现在我国几乎全部企业都正在开始复工。在这方面，我应该特别提到和表扬农业劳动者。在农民中，不论是合作社社员或者是个体农民，都没有接受停止工作这种挑拨性的号召。他们在没有任何集中领导的情况下，完成了80％到90％的秋收工作。在工业企业、商业和运输业中，已经开始工作，但是，目前我们不能说生产是正常进行的，还不时发生局部性和临时性罢工，而且这些罢工造成了严重损失。这种罢工浪潮虽然在逐日减退，但是还没有完全停止。产生这种现象有两个原因。首先是反革命势力还在事态发展的背后活动，他们提出最荒谬的要求，企图在全国造成尽可能最严重的经济损失，以便在经济困难之后能够对我们的民主制度发动又一次进攻。其次是在若干地方，善良的劳动者并不是总能清楚地认识到，他们把复工同暂时还不能实现的要求联系起来就是损害自己的利益。
    生活恢复正常后将改组和加强政府
    卡达尔接着说，根据政府11月4日的声明，在生活完全恢复正常以后，我们将改组政府，以共产党员、优秀的非党人士和专家来加强政府。我们对非党人士提出的唯一要求就是：希望他们在社会主义的基础上工作，希望他们保护社会主义成果。只要生活一天没有完全恢复正常，我们就不进行任何政府改组。我们只是希望这样的可能性尽快出现。可是，我们不能在反革命的压力下、也不能在走入迷途的善良劳动群众的压力下这样做。我们深深吸取了纳吉政府的教训。向反革命作斗争必须用粉碎反革命的办法，而不是用让步的办法。
    纳吉政府的情况怎样呢？在反革命的压力下，每过一小时就换一个部长。政府的活动完全陷于讨论和执行这种换了又换的要求。政府不能够履行它的现实职责。反革命越来越强大，而且每一小时都在进展。
    卡达尔说，在某些地方，有人代表工人说，只有满足工人的全部要求，工人才工作。其中许多要求是正当的，但是问题在于，现在无法满足这些要求。我们提高工资的决定已经达到了这样的限度，超过这个限度就会发生通货膨胀。谈谈提高工资是容易的，印刷钞票也是容易的，但是我们决不能这样做。没有一个明智的人希望通货膨胀，因为通货膨胀的重担首先压在劳动者的肩上。为了满足一切合理的要求，必须要有基础，而这个基础是用劳动创造的。因此，现在各地必须立即开始进行生产劳动，首先是安排煤和电力的生产。
    纳吉政府对人民犯了不可弥补的错误
    卡达尔然后谈到了伊姆雷·纳吉。他说，我认为，这个问题已经是一个成了过去的历史问题了，而我们的人民即将在日程上越过这一问题。纳吉政府和纳吉本人对匈牙利人民犯了不可弥补的错误。事实上，由于它在反革命进攻之下的无能和麻木，他掩护和包庇了罪恶的反革命白色恐怖。即使作为共产党员，他也起了不可饶恕的作用。假如他无能，就应该公开告诉大家真相，然后辞职。他没有这样做，反而以自己的名义来掩盖这种恐怖。最后，在11月4日上午，他号召抵抗被请来制止白色恐怖罪行的苏联军队，他在电台上宣布政府仍然留在岗位上之后，就拿起皮包从小门溜出去跑到南斯拉夫驻匈牙利大使馆去要求避难。几天以后，经过外交途径，他表示希望离开匈牙利人民共和国领土。考虑到纳吉和他的同伴自己的愿望，我们使他们得到可能离开了匈牙利人民共和国领土。
    当罗马尼亚人民共和国政府答应让纳吉到罗马尼亚去避难之后，纳吉在11月23日便离开了匈牙利。卡达尔说，我们已经答应，对他的严重错误免予追究。我们将信守这一诺言。
    再次表示反对联合国干涉匈牙利内政
    最后，卡达尔总理谈到了联合国干涉匈牙利内政和有关苏联军队的问题。他说，我们认为，从10月23日开始的一切令人痛心的事件都是匈牙利的内部事情，谁也没有权利干涉这些事情。至于苏联军队撤退问题，这也是匈牙利的内政问题，从法律上说这是明显的不容争辩的。苏联军队驻在匈牙利领土上是依据几个国家的多边协定，它们参与斗争是应匈牙利合法政府的请求。苏联用这种援助，不仅协助挽救了匈牙利人民免于反革命恐怖，而且阻止了一个战争策源地的形成。
    卡达尔说，目前，只有依靠匈牙利劳动人民才能在我们国家内开始工作，恢复秩序，巩固人民政权和保证和平的、创造性的生活。现在我们有很多创伤，但是我们能够，而且一定能治好这些创伤。不过，究竟需要多长的时间我们才能解决所有的社会问题以及和国家主权有关的问题，那就要看我们自己了。虽然世界的进步力量支持着我们，但是一切还取决于我们的工作。
