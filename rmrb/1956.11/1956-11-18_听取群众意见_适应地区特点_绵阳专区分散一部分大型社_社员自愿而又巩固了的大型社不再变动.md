Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 16th - Leading organs in various counties of Mianyang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, have recently listened to the opinions of agricultural cooperative members and cadres. Based on specific circumstances, they have appropriately reduced the size or restored the original state of a batch of large-scale elementary agricultural production cooperatives that were merged after July this year and did not meet the conditions.

More than half of the fifteen counties under Mianyang Prefecture are mountainous and hilly areas, with vast terrain and inconvenient transportation. In July of this year, the entire region carried out cooperative mergers, and more than 1,100 small agricultural cooperatives were merged into 344 large-scale cooperatives. The number of member households in the agricultural cooperatives increased from an average of 48 households per cooperative to 181 households. These cooperatives are preparing to be upgraded to advanced cooperatives this winter and next spring. After the mergers, most of them were consolidated and actively engaged in production. However, about 15% to 20% of them, due to the blind pursuit of large scale by some cadres during the merger process, believed that "sooner or later cooperatives will be merged and upgraded, it is better to merge sooner than later," and that "fewer braids are easier to grab and easier to lead." As a result, they forcibly merged cooperatives regardless of their conditions. For example, the Guanghua Agricultural Cooperative in Liugou Township, Jiange County, was formed by merging seven small cooperatives in the vicinity into a large-scale cooperative. The entire cooperative extended as far as fifteen *hua li* [7.5 km], separated by mountains and rivers, with difficult transportation and different farming habits. Township cadres, in order to catch the wave of establishing large cooperatives, forced them to merge together, resulting in dissatisfaction among cooperative members and cadres. In some other cooperatives, after the mergers, the cadres had weaker capabilities and lacked management experience, and the leadership strength was not commensurate with the size of the cooperatives. Dongba Cooperative in Guangyuan County, after the merger this spring, suffered production chaos due to a lack of management experience, resulting in a 39% reduction in production this year. More than 150 pigs and cattle died in the cooperative, resulting in significant losses.

In addition, in 15% to 20% of the cooperatives throughout the region after the mergers, one cooperative or one production team often wanted to withdraw and produce independently. These cooperatives and production teams mainly did so because of residential relationships, living in the same mountain valley, riverbank, or sharing an irrigation ditch, making independent management more convenient.

The leading organs of various counties have taken different approaches to these agricultural cooperatives based on local conditions. For large-scale cooperatives that were voluntarily merged by most members and have been consolidated, no changes were made, allowing them to continue to consolidate and improve. For some forcibly merged cooperatives, they were promptly devolved and restored to their original small cooperatives based on the opinions of the members. In addition, based on the opinions of some cooperative members, the size of some agricultural cooperatives was reduced, allowing these agricultural cooperatives or production teams to withdraw and operate independently. During the handling process, cadres in various localities explained to the members that it was not that they did not want to run large cooperatives or that running large cooperatives was not good, but that the primary consideration was to benefit production.

    听取群众意见　适应地区特点
    绵阳专区分散一部分大型社
    社员自愿而又巩固了的大型社不再变动
    新华社成都16日电　四川省绵阳专区各县领导机关，最近听取农业社社员和干部的意见，并且根据具体情况，将今年7月以后合并的一批不合条件的大型初级农业生产合作社，适当划小或恢复原状。
    绵阳专区所属十五个县，有半数以上是山地和丘陵地区，地势辽阔，交通不便。今年7月，全区进行了并社工作，一千一百多个小型农业社被合并为三百四十四个大型社；农业社的社员户数由原来每社平均四十八户扩大到一百八十一户。这些社准备今冬明春升为高级社。并社以后，大多数都得到巩固，积极投入生产。但其中约占总数的15％到20％的社，由于在并社工作中，部分干部盲目求大，认为“早晚都要并社升级，晚并不如早并”，“辫子少了好抓，领导起来方便”，因而不顾各社条件，强迫合并。例如剑阁县柳沟乡光华农业社，是由附近七个小社合并组成大型社，全社范围远达十五华里，中间隔山隔河，交通困难，耕作习惯也不相同，乡干部为了赶浪头办大社，强迫并在一起，结果弄得社员、社干部不满意。还有一些社在合并以后，干部能力较弱，管理经验缺乏，领导力量与社的规模很不相适应。广元县东坝社，今年春天并社以后，由于缺乏管理经验引起生产混乱，因而今年减产39％，社里的猪、牛死掉一百五十多头，损失很大。
    此外，全区还有15％到20％的社在合并以后，往往其中有一个社或一个生产队愿意退出单独生产，这些社和生产队，主要因为居住关系，住在一条山沟，一处河坝或共同使用一条水渠灌溉，这样独立经营比较方便。
    各县领导机关根据当地具体情况对这些农业社都分别进行处理。对于大部分社员自愿并社而又巩固了的大型社，不再变动，让他们继续巩固提高；对于一部分强迫合并的社，根据社员的意见，及时分散，恢复原来的小社。另外，还根据一部分社员的意见，缩小了有些农业社规模，让这部分农业社或是生产队退出，由他们单独经营。各地干部在处理当中，都向社员说明并非不办大社或办大社不好，而是为了首先从有利生产出发的道理。
