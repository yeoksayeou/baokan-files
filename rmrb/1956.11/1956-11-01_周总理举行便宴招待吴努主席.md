    The Minister of Kachin Affairs of the Union of Burma, U Zanhta Hsin; the Chairman of the Kachin State Cultural and Economic Association of the Union of Burma, Shinwa Nao; the former Minister of Kachin Affairs and Chairman of Kachin Affairs of the Union of Burma, Duwa Zao Lang; the Judge of the High Court of the Union of Burma, U Min Teng; the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Burma, Ba Lin Dun; the Secretary of Kachin Affairs, U Shan Long; the Executive Secretary of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, Bo Din Maoji; the Director of the Research Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, U Khin Nyu; and the Ambassador of Burma to China, U La Mao, were also invited to the banquet.

    Among those present were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Vice Chairmen of the Nationalities Affairs Commission Wang Feng and Liu Chun, and Chinese Ambassador to Burma Yao Zhongming.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 31st – The Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, U Nu, announced today that he would donate 50 tons of rice to the workers of the state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory, which is manufacturing textile machinery for Burma. Chairman U Nu made the announcement to Vice Director Zhang Yintang after visiting the factory.

    This morning, Chairman U Nu, accompanied by Vice Mayor of Tianjin Li Gengtao, visited every workshop of the factory. Chairman U Nu stopped next to a newly manufactured sizing machine coated with butter in the assembly workshop. At this time, Vice Director Zhang Yintang said to Chairman U Nu: "This newly manufactured sizing machine is being prepared for shipment to Burma. It has electrified automatic detection of broken ends and automatic stop devices, and can size 320 meters per minute, which is twice as efficient as the old sizing machine." When Chairman U Nu and his entourage watched a roving frame with 124 spindles being test-run, Zhang Yintang told Chairman U Nu that this roving frame was designed and manufactured according to the characteristics of Burmese cotton fiber. This is the last of the sixteen roving frames manufactured for Burma, and the test run is very good. It will soon be shipped to Yangon together with the other four types of textile machinery manufactured by this factory for Burma.

    Engineer Wang Chuanyu and Special Parts Workshop Director Wang Houyu brought the rollers on the roving frame, the spindles on the twisting machine, and the steel ring traveler to Chairman U Nu as souvenirs. Chairman U Nu, holding these crystal-clear parts, said to the host: I will take them back to show the Burmese people, so that they know how you are helping us manufacture machines.

    Chairman U Nu and his entourage then left the state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory and drove to view the city and climb the sixth floor of the Department Store Heping Road Store to overlook the city scenery. When Chairman U Nu visited the fourth floor of the shopping mall, the person in charge of the store selected a dozen records of the most popular songs in China and gave them to Chairman U Nu.

    After ending his visit to Tianjin, Chairman U Nu and his entourage took a train back to Beijing at 1:33 pm today.

    周总理举行便宴招待吴努主席
    新华社31日讯　国务院总理周恩来今晚举行便宴，招待缅甸联邦反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努。
    缅甸联邦克钦部部长吴赞塔信、缅甸联邦克钦邦文化经济协会主席申瓦闹、缅甸联邦前克钦部部长兼克钦部政务主席杜瓦藻朗、缅甸联邦高级法院法官吴敏登、缅甸联邦外交部常任秘书巴林顿、克钦部秘书吴珊龙、缅甸联邦反法西斯人民自由同盟执行秘书波丁貌基、外交部研究司司长吴钦纽，缅甸驻华大使吴拉茂也应邀出席了宴会。
    出席作陪的，有外交部副部长章汉夫，民族事务委员会副主任汪锋、刘春，中国驻缅甸大使姚仲明等人。
    据新华社天津31日电　缅甸联邦反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努今天宣布赠送五十吨大米给正在为缅甸制造纺织机器的国营天津纺织机械厂的职工。吴努主席是在参观了这个工厂以后向副厂长张荫棠宣布的。
    今天上午，吴努主席在天津市副市长李耕涛的陪同下，参观了这个工厂的每一个车间。吴努主席在装配车间一台涂上黄油的新型整经机旁停了下来。这时，副厂长张荫棠向吴努主席说：“这台新制成的整经机正在准备装箱运往缅甸。它有电气化自动发觉断头和自动停车等装置，每一分钟可以整经三百二十公尺，比旧式整经机的效率要高两倍。当吴努主席和他的随行人员观看一台正在试运转的有一百二十四枚锭子的粗纱机时，张荫棠告诉吴努主席说：这种粗纱机是按照缅甸棉花纤维的特点设计制造的。这是为缅甸制造的十六台粗纱机中的最后一台，试运转的情况很好，不久就要和这个工厂为缅甸制造的另外四种纺织机器一起运到仰光去。
    这个工厂的工程师王传钰和专件车间主任王厚裕拿来粗纱机上的罗拉、拈线机上的锭子和钢领圈送给吴努主席作纪念。吴努主席拿着这些晶莹发光的机件，对主人说：我将把它带回去给缅甸人民看，让他们知道你们是在怎样帮助我们制造机器。
    吴努主席和他的随行人员随后离开了国营天津纺织机械厂，驱车观看市容并登上百货公司和平路商店的六楼鸟瞰全市风光。这个商店的负责人在吴努主席参观四楼商场时，选了十来张在中国最流行的歌曲唱片送给了吴努主席。
    吴努主席和他的随行人员结束了在天津的访问后，在今天下午一时三十三分乘火车回北京。
