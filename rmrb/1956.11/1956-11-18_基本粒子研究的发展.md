The scientific argument that all matter in the world is composed of atoms of elements was basically established in the last century. Mendeleev's famous periodic table of elements shows the intrinsic connections between the atoms of various elements. The hydrogen atom is the simplest atom. It is composed of a positively charged particle and a negatively charged particle. We call the positively charged particle a proton and the negatively charged particle an electron. A proton is more than 1,800 times heavier than an electron. People believe that protons and electrons are "elementary particles" used to form atoms.

Originally, people thought that light was a wave. At the end of the last century, scientists established the wave theory of light. However, since the discovery of the photoelectric effect (the phenomenon that light shining on a metal can cause the metal to emit electrons is called the photoelectric effect), people have tried to use the wave theory to explain this phenomenon, but the conclusions obtained were inconsistent with reality. To draw conclusions consistent with the facts, people should regard light as a kind of particle, which is called a photon. Therefore, a photon has both wave characteristics and particle characteristics. The unity of these two characteristics of particles is one of the great achievements of modern physics. A photon is uncharged and always moves at the speed of light (30 billion centimeters per second). Its properties are different from those of protons and electrons; it is another kind of elementary particle.

After people conducted more detailed research on the atomic nucleus, they realized that elementary particles are not only electrons, protons, and photons, and that so-called elementary particles are not the simplest particles. They exhibit very complex phenomena and are very complex particles.

In the process of studying the atomic nucleus, people discovered the neutron. Neutrons are emitted from the inside of the atomic nucleus, so people came to the conclusion that the atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. The characteristics of neutrons are different from those of protons, electrons, and photons. It is uncharged, but its mass is about the same as the mass of a proton. In addition, neutrons have another characteristic: they are unstable and can decay into a proton, and at the same time emit an electron and a very small (less than one percent of the mass of an electron) uncharged neutrino. The average lifespan of a neutron is thirteen minutes.

A neutron is an elementary particle. Although it can decay into a proton and emit an electron and a neutrino, this absolutely does not mean that a neutron is composed of three elementary particles: a proton, an electron, and a neutrino. Because in many atomic nuclear decay phenomena, we often see that protons in the atomic nucleus can also be converted into neutrons, and at the same time emit a positively charged electron (the so-called positron) and a neutrino. The decay of a neutron is an inherent characteristic of the neutron.

A neutrino is also an elementary particle. Because it is uncharged and has a small mass, it is difficult for us to discover it. However, we must assume its existence in the study of decay theory. Later, people did many experiments, all of which confirmed that this assumption was correct.

Positrons were first discovered when studying cosmic rays. Its mass is the same as that of an electron, but it is positively charged and is also an elementary particle. In some cases, for example, when a photon with a large energy of more than one million electron volts is near an atomic nucleus, it can simultaneously generate an electron and a positron, which is called pair production. Electrons and positrons can also be converted into photons. It can be seen that the mutual conversion of elementary particles is a very common phenomenon.

The above describes the situation of people's understanding of elementary particles before 1935. These elementary particles can probably be divided into two categories: one category is particles with a lighter mass, such as photons, neutrinos, electrons, and positrons; the other category is particles with a heavier mass, such as protons and neutrons.

Recently, people have discovered a new elementary particle, the antiproton. Its mass is the same as that of a proton, but the charge it carries is opposite to the charge carried by a proton.

When people studied the strong force (i.e., nuclear force) between protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus in 1935, they theoretically predicted the existence of a particle with a mass about 200 times the mass of an electron. Later, when studying cosmic rays in 1937, they discovered a particle with a mass of 207 times the mass of an electron. At that time, it was believed that this particle was the one predicted in the nuclear force theory. However, it was later learned that this particle does not have a strong interaction with the atomic nucleus, so it cannot be considered the particle predicted in the nuclear force theory. People call this particle a muon. Because its mass is between the mass of an electron and the mass of a proton, it is called a "meson." A muon can decay into an electron and two neutrinos.

In 1947, people discovered a new meson in the study of cosmic rays. This meson is called a pion. It has a strong interaction with the atomic nucleus. In addition to discovering positively charged pions and negatively charged pions, people also discovered neutral (uncharged) pions. The mass of a positively charged pion and a negatively charged pion is 273 times the mass of an electron, and its average lifespan is one percent of the average lifespan of a muon. It can decay into a charged muon and a neutrino.

The mass of a neutral pion is 265 times the mass of an electron, and its average lifespan is one ten-millionth of the average lifespan of a charged pion. It often decays into two photons.

Pions can not only be found in cosmic rays, but people can now use high-energy accelerators to artificially create pions. In this way, people can control the production of pions. This enables us to study the various characteristics of pions in more detail.

Due to improvements in research technology and research conditions, after people used cloud chambers and photographic emulsions to conduct cosmic ray research on high mountains, they discovered many new elementary particles. We can divide these elementary particles that have been discovered into two categories according to their mass: one category of elementary particles has a mass about three times larger than that of pions. This category of elementary particles is called heavy mesons, which includes charged and neutral ones. The other category of elementary particles is heavier than neutrons, protons, and antiprotons. This category of elementary particles is called hyperons. Hyperons also have charged and neutral ones.

We have now discovered many kinds of heavy mesons and hyperons.

Heavy mesons and hyperons can not only be found in cosmic rays, but people can also obtain them artificially using high-energy accelerators. This provides favorable conditions for people to study the characteristics of heavy mesons and hyperons. Now, in the process of studying elementary particles, people first preliminarily explore the production conditions and some main characteristics of a certain type of elementary particle in the study of cosmic rays, and then build a high-energy accelerator to produce this particle for more detailed and systematic research.

Due to the increasing development of science and technology, we are likely to discover more elementary particles than the number of heavy mesons and hyperons we now know. The increase in the number of elementary particles and the understanding of their characteristics are of paramount importance for people to understand the material world. People's research on atoms can penetrate from the understanding of the macroscopic world into the understanding of the microscopic world. The research on elementary particles will surely enable people to further understand the material world. So far, people's understanding of elementary particles is still insufficient and is still in its initial stage. The study of the internal connections and mutual conversion laws between elementary particles has just begun. Therefore, this new field in the field of physics requires many hardworking scientists to cultivate.

Chinese scientists have always paid attention to the research of elementary particles. Today, under the strong leadership of the Party and the government in scientific research work, they will surely make new contributions in this area.

    基本粒子研究的发展
    金星南
    世界上的一切物质都是由元素的原子所组成的科学论证，基本上是在上世纪内确立的。著名的门捷列夫的元素周期表，表明了各种元素的原子之间的内在联系。氢原子是最简单的原子。它是由一个带正电的粒子和一个带负电的粒子所组成的。我们把带正电的粒子叫做质子，带负电的粒子叫做电子。质子比电子要重一千八百多倍。人们认为质子和电子是用来组成原子的“基本粒子”。
    原先人们认为光是一种波动，在上世纪末科学家建立了光的波动理论。但自从光电效应（光照在金属上能使金属放出电子，这种现象称为光电效应。）发现以后，人们就企图用波动理论来解释这种现象，但所得到的结论是和实际相矛盾的。要得出和事实相符合的结论，人们应该把光认为是一种粒子，这种粒子叫做光子。所以光子具有波动特性和微粒特性。粒子对于这两种特性的统一是近代物理学的伟大成就之一。光子不带电，永远以光的速度（每秒钟三百亿厘米）运动着。它的性质和质子、电子都不同，它是另一种基本粒子。
    人们对原子核进行了更详细的研究之后，才知道基本粒子不只有电子、质子、光子，并且所谓基本粒子也不是最简单的粒子。它们呈现着很复杂的现象，是很复杂的粒子。
    在研究原子核的过程中，人们发现了中子。中子是从原子核内部放出的，所以人们作出这样的结论：原子核是由质子和中子组成的。中子的特性和质子、电子、光子都不同，它不带电，但它的质量和质子的质量差不多相同。此外，中子还有一种特性：它是不稳定的，它能蜕变为质子，并且同时放出一个电子和一个质量很小（不及电子的质量百分之一）的不带电的中微子。中子的平均寿命为十三分。
    中子是一种基本粒子。虽然它能蜕变为质子并放出一个电子和一个中微子，这绝不表示中子是由质子、电子、中微子三个基本粒子所组成的。因为在很多原子核的蜕变现象中，我们常常见到原子核中的质子也能转化为中子，并同时放出一个带正电的电子（即所谓正电子）和一个中微子。中子的蜕变是中子的固有特性。
    中微子也是一种基本粒子，由于它既不带电，质量又小，所以我们很难发现它。但我们在蜕变理论的研究上必须要假定它的存在。以后人们做了许多实验，都肯定了这个假定是正确的。
    正电子是在研究宇宙线的时候首先发现的。它的质量和电子相同，但带有正电，它也是一种基本粒子。在某些情况下，例如能量较大的一兆电子伏以上的光子在某一原子核附近，可以同时产生一个电子和一个正电子，即所谓对产生。电子和正电子也可以转化为光子。由此可见，基本粒子的相互转化是一个很普遍的现象。
    上面所叙述的是1935年以前人们对于基本粒子的认识的情况。这些基本粒子大概可分为两大类：一类是质量较轻的粒子，如光子、中微子、电子、正电子；另一类是质量较重的粒子，如质子、中子。
    最近人们又发现了一种新的基本粒子，即反质子。它的质量和质子一样，但它所带的电荷和质子所带的电荷相反。
    当1935年人们研究原子核中质子和中子间的强大的作用力（即核力）的时候，在理论上预言了有一种质量约为电子质量二百倍的粒子存在。后来在1937年研究宇宙线时，发现了质量为电子质量二百零七倍的粒子，当时认为这种粒子就是在核力理论上所预言的那一种粒子。但是以后知道这种粒子和原子核的作用力不大，所以不能认为它是在核力理论上所预言的那一种粒子。人们称这种粒子为米欧介子。因为它的质量是在电子的质量和质子的质量之间的，所以称之为“介子”。米欧介子可以蜕变为一个电子和二个中微子。
    在1947年，人们又在宇宙线的研究中发现了一种新的介子。这种介子称为派爱介子，它和原子核的作用力很强。除发现带正电的派爱介子和带负电的派爱介子外，人们还发现了中性的（不带电的）派爱介子。带正电的派爱介子和带负电的派爱介子的质量为电子质量的二百七十三倍，它的平均寿命等于米欧介子的平均寿命的百分之一，它可以蜕变为带电的米欧介子和中微子。
    中性的派爱介子的质量为电子质量的二百六十五倍，它的平均寿命等于带电派爱介子的平均寿命的一千万分之一，它常蜕变为二个光子。
    派爱介子不仅在宇宙线中可以找到，人们现在可以利用高能加速器人工制造派爱介子。这样，人们就可以控制派爱介子的产生。这就使得我们能够更详细地来研究派爱介子的各种特性了。
    由于研究技术和研究条件的改进，人们在高山上利用云雾室和照相乳胶进行宇宙线的研究后，又发现了很多新的基本粒子。目前已经发现的这些基本粒子，我们可以按照它们的质量分为两大类：其中一类基本粒子的质量比派爱介子约大三倍，这类基本粒子称为重介子，里面有带电的和中性的。另一类基本粒子的质量比中子、质子和反质子都重，这类基本粒子叫做超子。超子也有带电的与中性的。
    我们现在已经发现的重介子和超子有许多种。
    重介子与超子不但能在宇宙线中找到，并且人们也能利用高能加速器的人工方法获得。这样对于人们研究重介子和超子的特性提供了有利的条件。现在人们在研究基本粒子的过程中，首先在宇宙线的研究中初步地探索某类基本粒子的产生条件和一些主要特性，然后再造高能加速器来产生这种粒子，作更详细的有系统的研究。
    由于科学技术的日益发展，我们很可能发现比现在我们所知道的重介子与超子的数目更多的基本粒子。基本粒子的数目增多，以及对于它们的特性的了解，对于人们认识物质世界是具有头等重要的意义的。人们对于原子的研究，就能从宏观世界的认识深入地进入微观世界的认识。对于基本粒子的研究，必定可以使人们对于物质世界的认识更进一步。到目前为止，人们对于基本粒子的认识还十分不够，还处于初步的阶段。对于基本粒子间的内在联系和互相转化的规律的研究还是刚刚开始。所以这片物理学领域中的新园地是需要很多刻苦耐劳的科学家们去开垦的。
    我国的科学家对基本粒子的研究一向是注意的。今天他们在党和政府对科学研究工作坚强的领导下，在这方面一定能作出新的贡献。
