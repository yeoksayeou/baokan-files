Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 13th. A group of woodworking and sewing handicraft workers who moved from Shanghai, Tianjin and other places to Xining City have recently moved into newly built cooperative factories for production due to business development.

This group of handicraft workers, after moving to Xining this year, organized themselves into cooperative factories for production. The woodworking factory produced tens of thousands of pieces of office furniture and more than a thousand sets of sofas for various organizations and groups in Xining City. It also produced more than seven thousand pieces of equipment such as laboratory tables, examination beds, and instrument cabinets for several large hospitals such as Xining City People's Hospital and Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital. In addition to producing more than 20,000 sets of clothing for the citizens of Xining in batches, the sewing factory also processed fashionable clothes, suits and children's clothing for customers. The iron bed hardware factory, in the case of insufficient steel, processed old gasoline drums into materials for making iron beds, and the iron beds produced are beautiful and durable.

As a result of business development, the original workplaces were not enough, so new factories were established in the suburbs of Xining City.

Now, the woodworking factory is using its accumulated funds to add ten machines such as planers, universal tenoners, and mortisers. Together with the original machines, it will adopt semi-mechanized production next year, and the production capacity will be three times higher than this year. The sewing factory is also adding sewing equipment.

    支援内地的手工业者
    新华社西宁13日电　从上海、天津等地迁来西宁市的一批木器、缝纫手工业者，由于业务发展，最近陆续搬进新建的合作工厂里生产。
    这批手工业者今年先后迁来西宁以后，就组织成合作工厂进行生产。木器厂为西宁市各机关团体生产了上万件办公家具和一千多套沙发，为西宁市人民医院、青海省人民医院等几个大医院生产了七千多件化验台、诊断床、仪器柜等设备。缝纫厂除了成批地生产了两万多套服装供应西宁市民以外，还为顾客加工了时装、西服和童装。铁床五金厂在钢材不足的情况下，把旧汽油桶加工成为做铁床的材料，制出的铁床美观耐用。
    业务发展的结果，原来的工作地点不够用了，所以在西宁市郊区建立了新的工厂。
    现在木器厂利用他们积累的资金，增添了刨料机、万能开榫机、打眼机等十部机器，加上原来的机器，明年将采取半机械化生产，生产能力将比今年提高三倍。缝纫厂也在添置缝纫设备。
