    Two Kinds of Treatment
    Workers at the cooperative cafeteria in Gushui District, Qijiang County, Sichuan Province, treat peasant customers with a rude attitude. At 5:00 PM on October 7th, two peasants went to this cooperative cafeteria to eat. They planned to buy a serving of stir-fried pork with soy sauce, a tofu soup, and two bowls of rice. The salesperson said impatiently, "No meat, no rice, just eat noodles." The two peasants had no choice but to buy two bowls of noodles.

    Just as they found seats, several more people came in to eat. At this point, the salesperson's attitude changed completely. He quickly stood up to greet them, "Comrades, what would you like to eat? We have meat, chicken, and other dishes."

    The peasants saw that these people were able to buy stir-fried dishes and wanted to add a stir-fried dish themselves. The waiter, Zhao Tianrong, said unhappily, "No way." The peasants asked, "Why? Why can others buy stir-fried dishes but we can't?" This question angered Zhao Tianrong, who flew into a rage: "Why are you asking? Even if we had some, we wouldn't sell it to you!" He even cursed the two peasants as "bastards." The two sides started arguing.

    The working style of the staff at the Gushui District Cooperative Cafeteria is very bad. Why should peasant customers be discriminated against when everyone is paying to eat? Relevant departments should strengthen their education, and those with consistently poor service attitudes should be severely criticized.　　　　　He Dong

    两样待遇
    四川省綦江县赶水区合作食堂的工作人员用粗暴的态度对待农民顾客。10月7日下午五时，有两个农民到这个合作食堂吃饭，他们准备买一份酱爆肉、一个豆腐汤、两碗饭。营业员很不耐烦地说：“没有肉没有饭，你们吃面吧。”两个农民只好买了两碗面条。
    他们刚找好座位，又有几个吃饭的人走进来，这时营业员的态度可就不同了，他连忙起来打招呼“同志你们吃啥？有肉、有鸡、还有别的菜。”
    农民看到这些人买到了炒菜，也想添一个炒菜，服务员赵天荣很不高兴地说：“没有”。农民问：“为什么，别人能买炒菜我们不能买呢？”这一问惹得赵天荣恼怒起来，他大发雷霆：“问什么？就是有也不卖给你们吃。”还骂这两个农民“混账”。双方吵了起来。
    赶水区合作食堂工作人员的这种作风是很恶劣的，为什么一样花钱吃饭，农民顾客就该受歧视呢？有关部门要对他们加强教育，对于服务态度一贯不好的人，应该给以严厉的批评。　　　　　河东
