Prime Minister Pham Van Dong delivered a farewell speech at the airport. He said that although Premier Zhou's stay in Vietnam was short, it was filled with the feelings of friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples. These few short days will leave an indelible impression in the hearts of the Vietnamese people forever.

He stated that the joint communiqué signed after the talks between the two sides shows that the Vietnamese and Chinese governments share the same views on major issues in the international situation and on the relations between our two countries. Both sides agreed on the need to strengthen the unity between peace-loving countries, especially between Asian and African countries, in order to thwart the imperialists' conspiracies of colonial aggression. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the existing cooperation between the two countries and agreed to further develop good relations between the two countries in all aspects based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the lofty proletarian internationalist spirit. The Vietnamese people are greatly encouraged by the generous and selfless assistance provided by the Chinese people in the cause of building Vietnam's homeland and the active support given by the Chinese people in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the homeland based on the Geneva Accords. The Vietnamese people deeply realize that the inseparable relationship with the Chinese people is an important factor in consolidating North Vietnam and striving for the reunification of the homeland.

Finally, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, on behalf of the Government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wished Premier Zhou Enlai success in his visit to Asian countries, making a significant contribution to the cause of uniting the people of Asian countries in defending peace and opposing colonial aggression.

Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a farewell speech. He once again expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the warm welcome and cordial hospitality of the Vietnamese people.

He said that your beautiful country and your achievements in work have made a deep impression on us. We are particularly impressed by your spirit of hard work, diligence and simplicity. Through this visit, we are even more aware that the Chinese people must continue to humbly learn from the many strengths of the Vietnamese people.

Premier Zhou Enlai continued, "The leaders of our two governments have held close talks over the past few days and signed a joint communiqué. The two governments guarantee that in our mutual relations and in our relations with other countries, we will strictly abide by the Five Principles and resolutely prevent chauvinistic errors. We believe that this will not only further consolidate and develop the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, but will also help enhance mutual trust and cooperation between countries around the world."

Finally, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, wished the Democratic Republic of Vietnam greater achievements in all aspects of construction, wished the Vietnamese people continuous victories in the cause of striving for the peaceful reunification of the homeland, and wished the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples to continue to develop.
