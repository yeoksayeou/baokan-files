    Disaster Victims Should Not Be Treated This Way
    We are members of the Fourth Agricultural Production Cooperative in Puhui Temple Township, Queshan County, Henan Province. This year, our county suffered a disaster, and the Party and the government have been very concerned about us. In addition to providing us with relief funds and winter clothing, they also organized and led us to engage in sideline production for self-salvation. In order to reduce the burden on the government, with the assistance of the Queshan County Production Relief Office and other units, we signed a contract with the Fourth Basic Construction and Installation Company 404 Construction Site of the Central Petroleum Industry Department to quarry stones. The contract clearly stipulated a quantity of more than 2,200 cubic meters, a period of two months, and specified the specifications, quality, and excavation location (the excavation location was designated by them). After the contract was signed, all our cooperative members worked day and night to open the mountain and quarry stones. However, they only purchased part of the stone we produced according to the contract, and refused to purchase the remaining 400-plus cubic meters, worth more than 1,000 yuan. After several contacts by the Queshan County Support Office, they only agreed to accept about 20 cubic meters.
    These stones are the result of the hard work of all our cooperative members. We request the leaders of the 404 Construction Site to purchase all of them in accordance with the contract and not let us suffer losses. We also hope that the relevant leaders will promptly investigate and deal with this issue.
    All members of the Fourth Agricultural Production Cooperative

    不应该这样对待灾民
    我们是河南省确山县普会寺乡第四农业生产合作社的社员。今年我县受灾，党和政府都很关心我们，除发给我们救济款、寒衣以外，又组织领导我们搞副业生产自救。为了减轻政府的负担，我们曾在确山县生产救灾办公室等单位的协助下，同中央石油工业部第四基本建设安装公司四○四工地签订了采挖石头的合同。合同明文规定的数量是二千二百多方，时间两个月，并规定了规格、质量和挖掘地点（挖掘地点是他们指定的）。合同订好以后，我们全体社员就夜以继日地开山、采石。可是我们按照合同生产的石方，他们只收购了一部分，剩下的四百多方、合人民币一千多元，他们竟拒绝收购。后经确山县支援办公室几次联系，才答应收二十来方。
    这些石方是我们全体社员辛勤劳动的成果，我们要求四○四工地的领导者要按照合同规定全部收购，不要让我们吃亏。也希望有关领导方面迅速检查并且处理这个问题。
