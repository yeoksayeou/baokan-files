    Is It Good to Establish Ethnic Joint Cooperatives?

    The "Yunnan Daily" published an editorial on November 20th entitled "Is it Better to Establish Single-Ethnic Cooperatives or Joint Cooperatives?"

    Yunnan is a province with many ethnic groups. When cooperatives were being planned in various places, the question arose: in areas where multiple ethnic groups live together, is it better to establish single-ethnic cooperatives or ethnic joint cooperatives? The editorial first discussed the facts of the past year. The editorial stated: Looking at the agricultural cooperatives established in various parts of Yunnan Province this year, ethnic cooperatives account for more than 60%. Whether single-ethnic or joint cooperatives, most have been able to increase production. Some joint cooperatives have already gained experience in mutual learning and complementing each other. However, many joint cooperatives have indeed encountered many difficulties and problems in the process of consolidation. The most prominent are: the issue of mutual trust between ethnic groups; the differences in production technology levels leading to differences in production cooperation and remuneration; and the problems that arise in production activities due to different customs and habits. Facts have proved that some problems cannot be solved well in a short period of time, and mishandling them may even cause ethnic disputes. The experience of the previous period has proved that in areas where ethnic groups live together, in order to better take care of the differences in production, life, and customs of various ethnic groups, it is generally advisable to establish single-ethnic cooperatives when cooperatives are first established if it is possible to do so. Judging from the opinions reflected by ethnic minority masses in various places recently when deliberating on the transition of cooperatives, this is also in line with their requirements and wishes. This spring, in some places, joint cooperatives formed by ethnic groups whose production and living conditions are too disparate to be taken care of can be transformed into single-ethnic cooperatives based on the voluntary wishes of the members of each ethnic group.

    In many areas where multiple ethnic groups live together, the residential patterns of the ethnic groups are intertwined and dispersed, the economic ties are very close, the production and living conditions are not too different, and the ethnic relations are relatively good. In such places, it is still possible for several ethnic groups to establish joint cooperatives; this is beneficial for learning from each other's strengths and improving together. However, according to the experience of various places, more preparations should be made to establish joint cooperatives: cadres from all ethnic groups must be trained and assigned within the cooperative; the habits of all ethnic groups must be respected; especially in organizing production, full attention must be paid to the production technology level of each ethnic group, and they must be good at leveraging the strengths of each ethnic group and carrying out reasonable division of labor. In the distribution, the different needs of all ethnic groups must be taken into account, attention should be paid to taking care of and protecting the interests of ethnic minority members, and it should be ensured that members of all ethnic groups can increase their income.

    This editorial pointed out: Whether it is better to establish single-ethnic cooperatives or ethnic joint cooperatives, the key issue lies in earnestly implementing the principle of voluntarism, based on the characteristics of each place, starting from the perspective of being conducive to production and conducive to ethnic unity. Whether it is in terms of the policy of joining cooperatives, the organizational form, or the management system, we must earnestly listen to the opinions of ethnic minority masses, fully take into account ethnic characteristics, and never mechanically apply the experience of other places, or allow only a few cadres to make subjective and dogmatic decisions.

### 办民族联合社好不好？

    办民族联合社好不好？
    11月20日“云南日报”以“是办单一民族社还是办联合社？”为题发表了一篇社论。
    云南是一个多民族的省份。各地在酝酿办合作社的时候，就发生了这样一个问题：在多民族杂居的地区，到底是办单一民族社好呢，还是办民族联合社好？社论先就一年来的事实作了论述。社论说：从今年云南省各地所办的农业社来看，民族社占60％以上。不管是单一社还是联合社，大多数能够增产。有的联合社已经取得了几个民族互相学习取长补短的经验。但是，许多联合社在巩固的过程当中也确实遇到了不少困难和问题。比较突出的是：民族间的互相信任问题；生产技术水平悬殊所引起的生产协作与报酬的差异问题；风俗习惯不同在生产活动中所出现的问题。事实证明，有些问题不是较短时期内所能很好地解决的，处理不好甚至会引起民族纠纷。前一时期的经验已经证明，在民族杂居区，为了更好地照顾各民族的生产、生活以及风俗习惯等方面的不同，在开始办社的时候，凡是能够办单一民族社的，一般以办单一民族社为宜；从各地最近在酝酿转社中少数民族群众所反映的意见来看，这样做也是符合他们的要求和意愿的。今年春天，有些地方勉强把一些生产、生活条件过于悬殊难以兼顾的民族凑成的联合社，可以根据各民族社员的自愿转为单一民族社。
    在许多民族杂居区中，各族居住情况是交错、分散的，经济联系也很密切，生产、生活条件不太悬殊，民族关系又比较好。在这样的地方，仍然可以由几个民族办联合社；这对取长补短、共同提高是有好处的。不过，根据各地的经验，要办联合社，就要作更多的准备：社内一定要培养、配备各民族的干部；尊重各民族的习惯；特别是在组织生产中，要充分注意各民族的生产技术水平，善于发挥各民族的特长，进行合理分工。在分配的时候要照顾各民族的不同需要，要注意照顾和保护少数民族社员的利益，保证各族社员都能增加收入。
    这篇社论指出：不管办单一民族社也好，办民族联合社也好，关键问题还在于切实执行自愿原则，根据各地特点，从有利于生产和有利于民族团结出发。不管在入社政策问题上、组织形式问题上，管理制度上，都要认真听取少数民族群众的意见，充分照顾民族特点，决不能硬搬别处的经验，或者只由少数干部主观主义地硬性决定。
