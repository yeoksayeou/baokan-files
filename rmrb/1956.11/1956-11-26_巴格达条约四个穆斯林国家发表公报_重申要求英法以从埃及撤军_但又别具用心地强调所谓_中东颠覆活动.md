Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The four Muslim member countries of the Baghdad Pact, after holding a four-day meeting in Baghdad, issued a communiqué on November 23, reaffirming their demand that Britain, France, and Israel withdraw their troops from Egypt.

The communiqué also stated that the four countries noted the recent communiqué issued by the heads of Arab states in Beirut, and generally speaking, it was in line with their own views.

However, it is worth noting that the four-country meeting communiqué specifically emphasized that they viewed the so-called "rising tide of subversive activities in the Middle East" with "unease and shock," and would "take all necessary measures to deal with this threat." This emphasis by the four-country meeting is utterly incompatible with its expressed support for Arab countries against aggression.

The Associated Press, on the 22nd, quoted well-informed sources in Baghdad as saying that Pakistani President Mirza went to discuss "the problem of the growing communist influence in the Middle East" with the King of Saudi Arabia on the 21st.

According to authoritative sources in London, British authorities are brewing a conspiracy to interfere in Syria, which supports Egypt and firmly opposes the British and French aggression. This conspiracy of the British authorities is based on their fabricated claim of a so-called "crisis of communist infiltration" in Syria.

Meanwhile, according to United Press International, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan, belonging to the Baghdad Pact group, are "advising" Syria to change the policies it is pursuing.

Xinhua News Agency, November 24th dispatch: Damascus newspapers reported that under the influence of the imperialists, the participants of the Baghdad meeting are repeating the old tune—planning to establish an "Islamic Defense Group" with the participation of all Arab countries as well as Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. This group will be related to Britain through the four member countries of the Baghdad Pact, and to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization through Pakistan. Britain and the United States are both members of this organization.

### 巴格达条约四个穆斯林国家发表公报  重申要求英法以从埃及撤军  但又别具用心地强调所谓“中东颠覆活动”

    巴格达条约四个穆斯林国家发表公报
    重申要求英法以从埃及撤军
    但又别具用心地强调所谓“中东颠覆活动”
    据新华社讯　参加巴格达条约的四个穆斯林国家在巴格达举行四天会议后11月23日发表公报，重申要求英、法、以三国撤出它们在埃及的军队。
    公报还说，四国注意到各阿拉伯国家首脑最近在贝鲁特发表的公报，一般地说，这是和它们自己的意见一致的。
    但是，值得注意的是，四国会议公报特别强调它们以“不安和震惊的心情”注视着所谓“中东颠复活动的日益高涨的浪潮”，并且还要“采取一切必要的措施来对付这种威胁”。四国会议这种强调和它表示要支持阿拉伯国反对侵略的立场，是十分不调和的。
    美联社22日援引巴格达消息灵通人士的话说，巴基斯坦总统米尔扎21日去同沙特阿拉伯国王讨论了“在中东日益增长的共产主义的影响的问题”。
    另据伦敦权威人士透露，英国当局正在酝酿着对支持埃及、坚决反对英法侵略的叙利亚进行干涉的阴谋。英国当局的这种阴谋是以他们的捏造的所谓叙利亚存在着“共产党渗入危机”的说法作借口的。
    同时，据合众社报道，属于巴格达条约集团的土耳其、伊拉克、伊朗和巴基斯坦正在“劝告”叙利亚改变它所奉行的政策。
    据新华社24日讯　大马士革报纸报道，在帝国主义者的影响下，巴格达会议参加者重弹旧调——计划建立有一切阿拉伯国家以及土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦参加的“伊斯兰防御集团”。这个集团将通过巴格达条约的四个成员国同英国发生关系，并且通过巴基斯坦同东南亚条约组织发生关系，英国和美国都是这个组织的成员国。
