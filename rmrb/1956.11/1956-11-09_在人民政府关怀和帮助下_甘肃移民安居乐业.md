    Under the Care and Assistance of the People's Government,
    Gansu Immigrants Live and Work in Peace and Contentment
    (Our newspaper dispatch) More than 79,200 immigrants who moved to Gansu Province from all over the country this year are living and working in peace and contentment under the care and assistance of the People's Government.
    The immigrants who moved to Gansu Province this year have all participated in production and work. Among them, the first batch of immigrants reaped a bumper harvest in the summer and autumn production seasons. Most of them have not only achieved self-sufficiency, but some also have surplus grain. The autumn harvest distributed to 134 immigrant households in the Fifth Township of Dunhuang County is enough to eat until next summer. Zhou Yanshan, a Beijing immigrant in the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative of Helan County, has already earned 2,170 work points, which can be distributed at least 5,700 jin of grain, enough for a family of five to eat. He also received an income from sideline production.
    Winter is coming, and the Gansu Provincial People's Committee is sewing cotton-padded clothes for the immigrants. According to the responsible comrade of the Gansu Provincial Immigration Bureau, more than 60% of the immigrants can get a complete set of cotton-padded clothes. In areas with relatively cold climates, the government also plans to distribute a leather coat to each immigrant household. In addition, the Gansu Province and county People's Committees are stepping up the construction of new houses for the immigrants. In Zhangye alone, it is planned to build about 20,000 rooms. Some immigrants have already moved into new houses. Their children have also entered schools, and some have also enjoyed student grants. The provincial health institutions have also organized a large number of medical teams (groups) to conduct mobile medical services in the immigrant areas. (Kuang Kuang)

    在人民政府关怀和帮助下
    甘肃移民安居乐业
    本报讯　今年从全国各地迁移到甘肃省的七万九千二百多名移民，在人民政府的关怀和帮助之下，过着安居乐业的生活。
    今年迁到甘肃省的移民，全部参加了生产和工作。其中第一批移民在夏、秋两季生产中，大部分获得了丰收，不但达到了自给，有的还有了余粮。敦煌县第五乡一百三十四户移民秋收分到的粮食，足够吃到明年夏季；贺兰县红星农业社的北京移民周彦山已经挣到了两千一百七十个劳动工分，至少可以分到粮食五千七百多斤，足够五口之家吃用，他还从副业生产中得到一笔收入。
    冬天来了，甘肃省人民委员会正在为移民缝制棉衣。据甘肃省移民局负责同志说，60％以上的移民可以得到全套棉衣，气候比较寒冷的地区，政府还准备发给每户移民一件皮衣。此外，甘肃省和各县人民委员会还加紧为移民盖造新房，仅张掖一地就计划修盖两万间左右，部分移民已经搬进了新房。他们的儿童也都进了学校，有的还享受了助学金的待遇。省的各级卫生机构还组织了大批医疗队（组）在移民区进行巡回医疗。（匡匡）
