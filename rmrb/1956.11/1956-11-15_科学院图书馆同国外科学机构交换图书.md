Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has now established book exchange relationships with over 800 scientific institutions in 52 countries. At the end of last year, it had relationships with just over 400 units in 41 countries.

Exchanging books with foreign scientific institutions is a measure to improve work in the Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences following the call made at the Party Central Committee's conference on intellectual problems in January and February this year to catch up with the world's advanced scientific levels as quickly as possible.

The Library of the Academy of Sciences has a collection of 1.1 million volumes, of which 70,000 were added this year. Since the first half of this year, the library has ordered 9,300 types of back issues and current issues of periodicals from abroad. In addition, it has purchased some valuable books, including the only existing microscopic films of all the Dunhuang scrolls held by the British Museum in London, totaling 105 rolls. Currently, the library has compiled catalogs of Chinese and various foreign language chemical periodicals, as well as Russian periodicals, for the convenience of scientists to consult. The work of duplicating scientific data microfilm is also actively underway.

The library has newly opened a Natural Science Reading Room and a Social Science Reading Room, displaying new periodicals, dictionaries, manuals, encyclopedias, yearbooks, bibliographies, indexes, atlases and other reference books.

    科学院图书馆同国外科学机构交换图书
    据新华社讯　中国科学院图书馆现在已经同五十二个国家的八百多个科学机构建立了交换图书的关系。去年年底，同这个图书馆建立关系的只有四十一个国家的四百多个单位。
    同国外科学机构交换图书，是今年1月到2月党中央召开关于知识分子问题会议上提出尽速赶上世界先进科学水平的号召以后，中国科学院图书馆改进工作的一项措施。
    科学院图书馆藏书已有一百十万册，其中七万册是今年增加的。今年上半年以来，图书馆向国外订购了过期期刊和现期期刊共九千三百种。另外，还购买了一些有价值的图书，其中有目前我国仅有的伦敦大英博物馆所藏全部敦煌卷子显微影片，共一百零五卷。现在，图书馆已经编成了本馆和各研究所的图书馆、室的中文和各种外文的化学期刊目录，以及俄文期刊目录，以便科学家查阅。复制科学资料显微影片的工作也正在积极进行。
    这个图书馆新辟了自然科学阅览室和社会科学阅览室，陈列的书籍中有新到期刊和词典、手册、百科全书、年鉴、书目、索引、图谱等参考用书。
