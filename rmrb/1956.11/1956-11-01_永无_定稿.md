	Never a "Final Draft"
	Shi Hong
	Some municipal-level agencies often write "Preliminary Draft," "Draft," or "Unfinalized Draft" on various work instructions issued to district-level agencies and grassroots organizations. Strangely, as time passes, what you find in the archives are still "Preliminary Draft," "Draft," or "Unfinalized Draft," with no "Final Draft."

	On August 27th of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Election Committee Office issued a "Regulation on Several Policy Boundaries for Reviewing Voter Qualifications" to the district election committee offices, and instructed them to complete the voter qualification review work by mid-September. Obviously, the task was very urgent, but on September 5th, the Municipal Election Committee Office issued a second "Regulation," making many revisions to the first "Regulation." This caused the grassroots work to take many detours and delayed the completion time. What was going on? It turned out that the "Regulation" issued on August 27th was the "Fourth Draft," and the one issued on September 5th was the "Fifth Draft." With only a few days left until mid-September, would there be a "Sixth Draft" or "Seventh Draft"? And when could there be a final "Final Draft"? When the district election committees asked the Municipal Election Committee Office for instructions, the answer they received was: "We don't know." So everyone had to bite the bullet and act according to the fifth "Draft." Even stranger, the "Shanghai Voter Registration Work Implementation Measures" was also a "Draft." Now that the registration work has ended, the "Final Draft" has not yet been released. It seems that it will not be and does not need to be released.

	In the archives of a district people's committee in Shanghai, I found many such documents that only had "Drafts" and never a "Final Draft." For example, the Shanghai Labor Bureau issued a "Work Plan on Mobilizing Unemployed and Unoccupied Personnel in the City to Participate in National Construction in the Northwest Region" to various districts in January of this year. This work was completed as early as the end of March this year, but this plan is still a "Draft" to this day.

	Before deciding on a new important measure or plan, the leading organs first issue a "Preliminary Draft," "Draft," or "Unfinalized Draft" to solicit opinions from the grassroots and subordinates, and then make a "Final Draft"; or first formulate a "Provisional Method," try it out for a period, and finally make a "Final Draft." This is a good way to avoid subjectivism in the work and is completely necessary. But by doing so, there should always be a "Final Draft" in the end, and for some problems that must be decisively solved by the leaders, it is even more necessary to have a "Final Draft" as soon as possible, because it is the leader's responsibility to make timely decisions on matters within their scope of responsibility.

	The phenomenon of only seeing "Preliminary Drafts" and "Drafts" and never "Final Drafts" in leadership work reflects that the leaders are clueless about their leadership work. They have not paid attention to summarizing experience in practice, improving themselves, nor have they studied problems in depth. Therefore, they are clueless when the work starts, and they are still clueless when the work ends. They are clueless this year, and they will be clueless next year. For example, the voter registration work implementation measures are not being done for the first time. If the experience of voter registration work in the first general election had been summarized, they should now have a clear idea. Because they are clueless for a long time, they can only issue "Preliminary Drafts" and "Drafts" forever, and cannot have a "Final Draft."

	In future archives, if we can see more "Final Draft" documents, this may be a record and symbol of our continuously improving leadership level.

    永无“定稿”
    世鸿
    有些市级机关给区级机关和基层组织发各种工作指示时经常写上“初稿”“草稿”“未定稿”之类的字样。奇怪的是事过境迁，你从档案材料中找到的还是“初稿”“草稿”“未定稿”，没有“定稿”。
    上海市选举委员会办公室今年8月27日给各区选举委员会办公室发出一份“关于审查选民资格的若干政策界限的规定”，并且责成他们在9月中旬完成选民资格审查工作。显然，任务是十分迫切的，但9月5日，市选举委员会办公室又发来第二个“规定”，对第一次发的“规定”作了很多修改，这就使基层工作走了很多弯路，耽搁了完成的时间。是怎么一回事呢？原来8月27日发的一份“规定”是“四稿”（即第四次草稿），而9月5日所发的则是“五稿”（即第五次草稿），离开9月中旬只有几天了，还有没有“六稿”“七稿”呢？而且何时可以有最后的“定稿”呢？各区选举委员会向市选举委员会办公室请示时，得到的答复是：“不知道”。于是大家只好硬着头皮按第五次“草稿”办事。更奇怪的是连一份“上海市选民登记工作实施办法”，也是“草稿”。现在登记工作已经结束，“定稿”还没有出来。看来是不会也不需要出来了。
    我在上海一个区人民委员会档案中找到不少这类只有“草稿”永无“定稿”的文件。譬如上海劳动局今年1月份发给各区一份“关于动员本市失业无业人员的壮工参加西北地区国家建设的工作方案”，这个工作早在今年3月底就做完了，但这个方案至今还是“草稿”。
    领导机关在决定某项新的重要措施和计划之前，先把“初稿”“草稿”“未定稿”发下去，征求一下基层同下级的意见，再作“定稿”；或者先订出一个“暂行办法”，试行一个时期，最后作出“定稿”，这是避免工作中主观主义的良好办法，是完全需要的。但这样做，最后总该有“定稿”，而且对一些必须由领导者当机立断加以解决的问题，那就更需要早有“定稿”，因为对自己职责范围内的事及时做出决定，这是领导者的责任。
    在领导工作中只见“初稿”“草稿”永无“定稿”的现象反映了领导者对自己的领导工作心中无数，他们没有注意在实践中总结经验，提高自己，也没有深入实际研究问题，因此工作开始时心中无数，工作结束时心中还是无数。今年心中无数，明年还是无数。譬如说，选民登记工作实施办法，这并非是第一次做，如果总结过第一次普选时选民登记工作的经验，现在应该心中有数。因为长期是心中无数，这就永远只能发“初稿”“草稿”，不能有“定稿”。
    在今后的档案中，如果能多看到“定稿”的文件，这也许是我们领导水平不断提高的记录和标志。
