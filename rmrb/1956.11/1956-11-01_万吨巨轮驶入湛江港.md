    Ten-Thousand-Ton Giant Ship Enters Zhanjiang Port
    (Reported by Southern Daily) The Polish People's Republic's ten-thousand-ton ocean freighter "Marcin Kasprzak" sailed into Zhanjiang Port in mid-October carrying over ten thousand tons of goods, receiving a warm welcome from Zhanjiang Port workers.
    This giant ship, traveling from over ten thousand nautical miles away over a voyage of more than forty days, transported a large batch of equipment from the Polish People's Republic to Zhanjiang Port in support of our country's industrial construction. From the day the ship arrived at Zhanjiang Port, several gantry cranes and more than a dozen electric shovels and electric flatbed trucks on the dock became busy. They worked day and night to load and unload cargo on the dock. The entire process of unloading cargo was done mechanically. The more than ten thousand tons of cargo carried by this ship were completely unloaded in only one hundred and thirty-five hours and fifteen minutes, which was almost fifty-five hours ahead of the original schedule.
    Because Zhanjiang Port has good equipment, and the main projects of the first phase of port construction—wharves, harbor basins, waterways, and navigation marks—have been basically completed, the "Marcin Kasprzak" entered and exited the port and docked at the wharf very smoothly.

    万吨巨轮驶入湛江港
    据南方日报讯　波兰人民共和国的万吨远洋巨轮“玛布切克”号于10月中旬载着上万吨货物驶进湛江港，受到湛江港职工的热烈欢迎。
    这艘巨轮从一万多浬以外，经过四十多天的航程，把波兰人民共和国支援我国工业建设的大批器材运到湛江港。从轮船到达湛江港那天起，码头上的几部龙门式起重机和十多部电铲车、电板车繁忙起来了。它们不分昼夜地在码头上起运货物。起卸货物的全部过程都是用机械进行的。这艘船运来的上万吨货物只用了一百三十五小时零十五分钟就全部卸下了，比原定计划提前了差不多五十五小时。
    由于湛江港设备良好，第一期建港的主要工程——码头、港池、航道、航标等已经基本完工，因此“玛布切克”号进出港口和停泊码头都很顺利。
