    Mountain Product Purchase Prices Should Be Unified

    Many state-owned and jointly state-private enterprises purchase mountain products at varying prices. According to the deputy director of the Shicao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingtai, Hebei, this cooperative sold more than 800 jin of apricot kernels to the supply and marketing cooperative this year at a purchase price of 2 jiao per jin, while other enterprises offered 3 jiao 2 fen per jin. They still have 1,000 jin of peppercorns in storage because the price set by the supply and marketing cooperative is 2 yuan 2 jiao per jin, while other enterprises are offering 3 yuan 3 jiao per jin, a difference of more than 1,000 yuan on this one transaction alone. The Qianshantou Agricultural Production Cooperative has more than 1,000 jin of honey. The price set by the supply and marketing cooperative is 4 jiao 8 fen per jin, while other enterprises are offering 5 jiao 3 fen. They wanted to sell to other enterprises, but they were afraid to sell without authorization. This situation must be changed quickly. The supply and marketing cooperative should consult with the agricultural production cooperatives to negotiate prices based on market developments so that farmers do not suffer losses. Local authorities should also strengthen supervision to stop the phenomenon of arbitrarily suppressing and raising purchase prices. ·He Li·

    山货收购价格要统一
    许多国营和公私合营企业上山收购山货收购价格高低不一。据河北邢台石槽农业生产合作社副主任反映：这个社今年卖给供销社八百多斤杏仁，每斤收购价二角，而别的企业来买每斤出价三角二分；他们现在还存着一千斤花椒没有出卖，原因是供销社规定的价格每斤二元二角，而别的企业去买每斤出价三元三角，光这一笔买卖就相差一千多元。前山头农业生产合作社有蜂蜜一千多斤，供销社规定的价钱是四角八分一斤，而别的企业去买则出价五角三分；他们本想卖给别的企业，但是又不敢随便卖。这种情况要赶快改变。供销社应该根据市场发展情况和各农业生产合作社协商议价，不使农民吃亏，当地主管部门也要加强监督，制止任意压价和抬价收购的现象。·贺笠·
