Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 31st - The "Jiang Ya" ship, which sank more than seven years ago off the coast of Wusong, fully loaded with passengers, was completely salvaged yesterday.

The salvage operation began on May 16th this year, and the stern section of the sunken ship was raised to the surface more than two months ago. While divers were flushing away the silt from the sunken ship at the bottom of the water, they also recovered many remains and some gold bracelets, rings, pens, and other items belonging to the deceased.

The "Jiang Ya" was preparing to sail from Shanghai to Ningbo on the afternoon of December 3rd, 1948, before liberation. However, when the ship sailed to the Tongsha sea area outside Wusong, a violent explosion suddenly occurred in the rear of the ship, and it gradually sank. At that time, the ship's radio had been destroyed and could not send out a distress call. It was not until more than an hour later that a passing ship sent out a distress signal on its behalf. According to an appeal published in Shanghai newspapers by representatives of the families of the victims at the time, the Kuomintang's China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received the distress telegram at 8:00 p.m., but did not dispatch a rescue ship until 3:00 a.m. the next morning, delaying the rescue for seven hours. Only seven or eight hundred passengers were rescued, while more than three thousand eight hundred people tragically died. Among the bodies salvaged by divers at the time, some mothers were still tightly embracing their children, and older brothers were firmly holding onto their younger brothers, a truly heartbreaking sight. As for the reason for the ship's sudden explosion, the Kuomintang's China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has never provided a clear explanation.

After the news of the salvage of the "Jiang Ya" began to spread, the families of the victims wrote to the salvage engineering department one after another, inquiring about how the remains would be handled. Zhang Zhikui, Director of the Salvage Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they have already begun to work with relevant units to prepare for the proper handling of the remains of the deceased, and are also preparing to send technicians to study the cause of the ship's explosion.

### 沉没七年的江亚轮捞起来了

    沉没七年的江亚轮捞起来了
    新华社上海31日电　七年多以前满载着旅客沉没在吴淞口外的江亚轮，昨天已经全部被打捞起来。
    打捞工程在今年5月16日开工后，沉船尾部的一段，早在两个多月前便捞出水面。潜水员们在水底冲除沉船淤泥的时候，还捞起了许多尸骨和一些死者的金手镯、戒指、钢笔等。
    江亚轮是在解放前1948年12月3日下午准备从上海驶往宁波的；但是当轮船航到吴淞口外铜沙洋面附近的时候，船体后部突然发生猛烈的爆炸，随后逐渐下沉。当时船上的电台已经被毁，无法呼救。过了一个多钟头，才由一艘路过的轮船代发出呼救讯号。据当时死难旅客家属代表在上海报纸上刊登的呼吁书说，国民党的招商局晚上八时接到求救电报，到第二天早晨三时才派出抢救船，拖延七小时之久。救出的旅客只有七、八百人，而惨遭死难者达三千八百多人。当时被潜水员们捞起的死尸中，有的母亲还紧抱着孩子，哥哥牢牢地拉着弟弟，惨不忍睹。至于轮船突然爆炸的原因，国民党的招商局也一直没有明确的解答。
    这次江亚轮开始打捞的消息传出以后，死难旅客的家属纷纷写信给打捞工程部门，询问尸骨怎样安置。交通部打捞工程局局长张智魁对新华社记者说，他们已经会同有关单位，着手筹备妥善处理死者遗骨的问题，并且准备派技术人员研究轮船爆炸的原因。
