Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 24th -- Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike said in Washington on the 23rd: British and French troops must leave the Suez Canal area quickly, and there must be no more hesitation or delay. He said: The withdrawal of these troops is necessary so that work can begin to clear the Suez Canal of obstacles, which is essential to the welfare of many countries.

Bandaranaike emphasized that the new proposal put forward by Asian and African countries to the United Nations General Assembly, demanding the immediate withdrawal of British, French and Israeli troops, should show that world public opinion is almost unanimous in demanding a swift troop withdrawal. He believed that this proposal would be supported by a majority of countries, including the Scandinavian countries.

He also said: In order to facilitate the United Nations' efforts to seek a solution to the border issues between Israel and Arab countries, it is also necessary for Israeli troops to withdraw from their current positions.

The Prime Minister of Ceylon made these remarks to reporters before meeting with U.S. Acting Secretary of State Hoover.

    排除苏伊士运河的人为障碍
    锡兰总理再促英法迅速撤军
    新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克23日在华盛顿发表谈话说：英法军队必须迅速离开苏伊士运河区，决不能再犹疑不决或拖延。他说：撤退这些军队是必要的，这样一来才能开始进行对许多国家的福利十分必要的清理苏伊士运河障碍的工作。
    班达拉奈克强调指出：亚非国家向联合国大会提出的要求英法和以色列军队立即撤退的新提案，应当显示世界舆论差不多是一致要求迅速撤军。他相信这个提案会得到大多数国家的支持，包括斯堪的纳维亚国家在内。
    他还说：为了便利联合国努力谋求以色列同阿拉伯国家的边界问题的解决，以色列军队撤出他们现有的阵地也是必要的。
    锡兰总理是在会见美国代理国务卿胡佛之前，对记者说这番话的。
