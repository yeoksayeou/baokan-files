    Congratulatory Telegram from the President of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association
    Xinhua News Agency, November 12th – Tetsu Katayama, President of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, sent a telegram congratulating the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. The telegram reads as follows:
    Today, as your country cherishes social equality, steadily carries out socialist construction, and, in the international arena, contributes to world peace by adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence based on the Bandung Spirit, a grand commemoration of the 90th anniversary of the birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the pioneer of the Chinese revolution and the great leader who strived to expel foreign reactionary forces from China and achieve national independence, is being solemnly held in an atmosphere of heartfelt admiration and respect from the 600 million Chinese people. I extend my warmest congratulations.
    In our Japan, there are many people who had close friendships with Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and many who were influenced by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Moreover, many of the papers and speeches Mr. Sun Yat-sen wrote and gave in Japan have had a profound impact on Japanese progressive intellectuals, workers, and young students, leaving them deeply moved.
    From this, it can be seen that the emotions of the Japanese people in fondly remembering Mr. Sun Yat-sen are deep and unwavering.
    The Bandung Conference concentrated the solidarity of Asian and African countries, and today, when reactionary forces led by England and France are carrying out armed aggression against the Egyptian people, Asian and African countries have not hesitated to express their firm opposition and have protested with boundless hatred against the reactionary forces that infringe upon national sovereignty. The friendship and solidarity of Asian and African countries is becoming increasingly consolidated.
    The spirit of Mr. Sun Yat-sen is still vividly alive in people's hearts, and the spirit advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen has now become the foundation of the Bandung Spirit.
    I believe that Mr. Sun Yat-sen can not only be called the "Father of China," but even saying he is the "Father of Asia and Africa" would not be an exaggeration.
    My wish is that, in our Japan, we will strive even harder for the independence of our country, achieve peace, and promote prosperity, so that Japan and China can coexist and prosper together in a relationship of eternal friendship and cooperation.
    I extend my deep respect and congratulations to today's conference, and hope to further promote economic and cultural exchanges between Japan and China.
                        Tetsu Katayama

    Xinhua News Agency, November 12th – Tadatsugu Shimazu, President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, sent a telegram congratulating the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. The telegram reads as follows:
    To Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Beijing:
    I duly received your telegram of October 29th, and I am honored to send the following reply:
    On the occasion of the entire Chinese nation commemorating the 90th anniversary of the birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the pioneer of Chinese democracy and a great humanitarian, I am deeply honored to have the opportunity to express my congratulations. The Chinese Red Cross Society, which was strongly supported by Mr. Sun, has maintained and is expanding its activities based on the humanitarian spirit of the Red Cross for half a century. Especially after World War II, it made tremendous efforts to repatriate a large number of Japanese personnel; for this, the Japanese Red Cross Society is deeply grateful.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen, proceeding from lofty humanitarianism, often showed deep concern for the sufferings of the people. As the Chinese Red Cross Society and all its members participate in the commemorative meeting, the Japanese Red Cross Society, as a close fraternal organization, expresses its heartfelt congratulations.

   Congratulatory Letter from Kuraishi Takeshiro
    Xinhua News Agency, November 12th – Takeshiro Kuraishi, Professor at Tokyo University, Japan, sent a letter congratulating the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. The congratulatory letter reads as follows:
      Not long ago, when Soviet Representative Tikhvinsky visited Tokyo University, Representative Tikhvinsky said, "I specialize in studying the history of China from the Hundred Days' Reform to the Xinhai Revolution, especially what kind of help Japanese people gave to those patriots who participated in this reform and revolution, and I need relevant information in this regard." Upon hearing this, what immediately came to my mind was "Thirty-Three Years' Dream" written by "Miyazaki Toten." During Mr. Sun Yat-sen's exile, "Toten" completely forgot about the existence of his own family and devoted himself to protecting Mr. Sun's safety and maintaining his life. The first time I read this book, I was moved to tears. Especially: when planning the revolution, Mr. Zhongshan once confided to "Toten," "Although you are a foreigner, why are you so enthusiastic about the Chinese revolution?" This record in the book is still fresh in my memory, and it cannot be explained by abstract concepts such as humanitarianism. It is nothing more than a kind of close and intimate feeling that feels other people's pain as one's own. How beautiful is this kind of closeness beyond national borders that is like father and son, husband and wife, and brothers! While recommending this book to Representative Tikhvinsky, I was deeply moved again by the myriad connections between China and Japan. I heard that a celebration of the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth is being held in Beijing, and I would like to express my feelings briefly. At the same time, I sincerely hope that this close and intimate relationship between Japan and China can be revived on the occasion of this commemoration, and I even more hope that this closeness between the peoples of the two countries can grow and deepen in the future.
     Takeshiro Kuraishi

    To Mr. Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Beijing:

    Congratulatory Telegram from the President of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association
    Xinhua News Agency, November 12th – Hatim A. Alavi, President of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association, sent a telegram congratulating the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. The telegram reads as follows:
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away on March 12, 1925, at the age of fifty-eight. At the end of his life, he shouted the call of "Peace, Struggle, Save China!" It can be said that the final call of this great revolutionary leader was not only a summary of his life's work but also a final testament left to those who inherited him to complete the task of building China, a task that Sun Yat-sen himself had begun with great heroism fifty years ago.
    In 1905, Mr. Sun Yat-sen gathered thirty young Chinese students in Brussels and explained the Three Principles of the People to them. Now, half a century later, the Three Principles of the People has become a political program for one-fifth of the world's population, and today, thousands upon thousands of Chinese people fully understand the policies that this great revolutionary put forward on the podium in Brussels at that time. I believe that the Three Principles of the People is not only applicable to China but also to the whole world, and perhaps I can say that it is particularly applicable to Pakistan. In China and Pakistan, all those who truly want the people of the two countries to get closer to each other and form an unbreakable alliance must study the Three Principles of the People and apply it to their respective domestic and international relations. Under the leadership of the People's Government, China has successfully implemented the Principle of People's Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People through land reform. I hope that in the coming years, more and more leaders in Pakistan will be able to see with their own eyes the amazing achievements China has made in realizing this ideal of Mr. Sun Yat-sen.
    China's current leaders, including Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, held inconspicuous positions in Sun Yat-sen's Guangzhou government at the time. If others have disappeared today while these leaders are guiding China's national affairs, it is because they truly and profoundly understood Mr. Sun's teachings when they were young and wholeheartedly struggled to realize his teachings. Indeed, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was always a Chinese patriot; he lived for China and died for China. But the great cause he accomplished for China and the teachings he left behind have made him an immortal figure in the world. That's why, today, as you celebrate the ninetieth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, we in Pakistan also pay tribute to him. The Pakistan-China Friendship Association commemorates your great national leader together with you with the same feelings.

I believe that this great day will give the Chinese people new impetus to realize the lofty ideals of Mr. Sun, one of Asia's great leaders and most talented sons. I take this opportunity to wish China continued prosperity and happiness.

    日中文化交流协会会长的贺电
    新华社12日讯　日本中国文化交流协会会长片山哲来电祝贺孙中山先生诞辰九十周年。电文如下：
    今天，正当贵国热爱社会平等，稳步地进行社会主义建设，并在国际方面根据万隆精神奉行和平五项原则，对世界和平作出贡献的时候，在六亿中国人民衷心景仰和敬爱的气氛中，隆重地举行了纪念中国革命的先驱者和曾经努力奋斗、驱逐外国反动势力出中国、争取民族独立的伟大的领导者孙中山先生诞辰九十周年的纪念大会，谨致热烈的庆贺。
    在我们日本，有很多人同孙中山先生有过亲密的友谊，并且有很多人受过孙中山先生的熏陶。而且，孙中山先生在日本所写的许多论文和发表的演说，对日本的先进知识分子、工人和青年学生产生了深刻的影响，使他们感念不已。
    由此可见，日本国民亲切地怀念孙中山先生的情感，是至深且笃的。
    在万隆会议中曾经集中表现出亚非各国的团结，而在以英法为首的反动势力对埃及人民进行武装侵略的今天，亚非各国毫不犹豫地表示坚决反对，对侵犯民族主权的反动势力，怀着无限的憎恨提出了抗议。亚非各国的友谊和团结，是愈加巩固起来了。
    孙中山先生的精神，今天仍旧跃然地活在人们的心里，孙中山先生所倡导的精神，现在已成为万隆精神的基础。
    我觉得，孙中山先生不仅可称为“中国之父”，甚至说他是“亚非各国之父”，也决不是过分的。
    我的愿望是，在我们日本，今后要更加努力争取祖国的独立，实现和平，增进繁荣，以便使日中两国在永远的友谊和合作的关系中共存共荣。
    我对今天的大会谨致深切的敬意和祝贺，并且希望更进一步促进日中两国在经济和文化方面的交流。

    孙逸仙从崇高的人道主义出发，对人民群众的疾苦经常表现了深切的关怀。在此中国红十字会及其全体会员参加纪念大会之时，日本红十字会作为一个亲密的兄弟团体，表示衷心的祝贺。

  仓石武四郎的贺信
    新华社12日讯　日本东京大学教授仓石武四郎来信祝贺孙中山先生诞辰九十周年。贺信如下：
      不久以前，苏联齐赫文代表来访东京大学时，齐代表曾说：“自己专门研究中国由戊戌政变到辛亥革命期间的历史，尤其对参加了中国这种革新、革命的志士们，日本人给与了什么样的帮助，自己需要有关这方面的资料”。听后，立时涌现到我心头的是“宫崎滔天”写的“三十三年之梦”。在孙中山先生亡命中，“滔天”完全忘记自己家族的存在致力于保护先生的安全，维持先生的生活。在我第一次阅读这本著作时，感动得流下了眼泪。尤其是：在筹划革命时，中山先生曾向“滔天”开怀述说：“你虽然是外国人，但是为什么对中国革命这样热心呢？”书中的这一记载至今记忆犹新，这决不是用人道主义这类抽象的观念所能说明的。这不外是把别人的痛苦当作自己的痛苦而感受的一种至亲至近的感情。超越国界的这种情同父子夫妇，兄弟骨肉的亲密，该是何等的美丽。在我推荐这本著作给齐代表的同时，对中日两国之间的千丝万缕的关系，又重新受到深深的感动。听说：在北京举行孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念，我特略表寸感，同时，切望日中两国之间的这种至亲至近的亲密借这次纪念的机会能够复活起来，更切望这种两国人民之间的亲密今后更能成长加深。　　仓石武四郎

    巴中友协主席的贺电
    新华社12日讯　巴基斯坦中国友好协会主席哈提姆·阿·阿拉维来电祝贺孙中山先生诞辰九十周年。电文如下：
    1925年3月12日孙中山先生逝世，享年五十八岁，临终时他喊出了“和平、奋斗、救中国！”的呼声。可以说，这位伟大的革命领袖在临终时的呼声不仅是对他毕生的工作的总结，而且是给那些继承他来完成建设中国的事业的领导者们所留下的最后遗嘱，这一事业是孙中山自己在五十年前就极其英勇地着手进行的。
    1905年孙中山先生在布鲁塞尔集合了三十个中国的青年学生，向他们讲解三民主义。现在，经过了半个世纪，三民主义已经成为占全人类五分之一人口的政治纲领，今天千千万万的中国人民已经充分了解这位伟大的革命家当时在布鲁塞尔讲台上所提出的政策。我相信，三民主义不仅适用于中国，而且也适用于全世界，也许我可以说，它特别适用于巴基斯坦。在中国和巴基斯坦，凡是真正愿意中巴两国人民互相接近并结成牢不可破的联盟的人们，都必须学习三民主义，并且把它应用到各自国内和国际关系方面。中国在人民政府的领导下已经通过土地改革成功地实现了三民主义中的民生主义。我希望，在今后几年内巴基斯坦会有愈来愈多的领导人能亲眼看到中国为实现孙中山先生的这一理想所取得的惊人成就。
    中国目前的领导者，包括毛泽东和周恩来在内，在当时孙中山的广州政府里担任着不很重要的职务。如果说今天别的人已经销声匿迹而这些领导者则指导着中国的国家事务，这是因为他们在年青的时候就真正深刻地理解了孙先生的学说，并且全心全意地为实现他的学说而奋斗。的确，孙中山先生始终是一位中国的爱国者，他为中国而生，为中国而死。但是他为中国所完成的很大的事业以及他所留下来的学说使他成为全世界的一位不朽的人物。正因为这样，今天当你们在庆祝孙中山诞生九十周年的时候，我们在巴基斯坦也向他致敬。巴中友好协会怀着同样的心情和你们一起纪念你们伟大的民族领袖。
