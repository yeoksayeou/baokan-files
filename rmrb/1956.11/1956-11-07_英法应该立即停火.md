　　The governments of Britain and France, ignoring the warnings of world public opinion and disregarding the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly for an immediate ceasefire, have intensified their aggression against Egypt. This extremely arrogant attitude of the British and French aggressors poses an unprecedentedly serious threat to world peace. Peace-loving people all over the world demand that effective measures be taken immediately to stop the armed aggression of Britain and France and to uphold international law and human justice.
　　At this moment, the Soviet Union, as a powerful force for peace and a moral force, as a major power closely related to the peace and security of the Middle East, responding to the demands of the anxious people of the world, proposed to the United States that the two countries cooperate closely and immediately use the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union to stop the aggression of Britain and France. At the same time, the Soviet Union submitted a proposal to the United Nations Security Council requesting that measures be taken immediately to stop the aggressive war of Britain, France and Israel. The proposal also demanded that if Britain, France and Israel do not withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory within the specified time, "all member states of the United Nations, especially the permanent members of the Security Council, the United States and the Soviet Union, which possess strong air and naval forces, should provide military and other assistance to the Republic of Egypt, which has been subjected to aggression, namely, dispatching naval and air forces, ground forces, volunteers, instructors, and supplying military equipment or other kinds of assistance."
　　The Soviet Union's proposal to the United States and its proposal in the Security Council fully prove that the Soviet Union is the most resolute defender of world peace and the freedom and independence of all nations. If the United States and the Security Council accept the Soviet Union's proposal, it would be possible to use the anti-aggression forces of the entire world to force the British and French aggressors to stop their aggression against Egypt, end the bloodshed and sacrifice of the Egyptian people, and eliminate the danger of the spread and expansion of the war.
　　However, the Soviet Union's just proposal was immediately rejected by the United States with absurd excuses. In the Security Council, the United States once again stood with the British and French aggressors, opposing the Soviet proposal, with the result that the proposal was not adopted. This attitude of the United States fully demonstrates that, at the critical moment in Egypt, the position taken by the United States is the same as that of the British and French colonialists. It is only paying lip service to the suffering and sacrifice of the Egyptian people, and what it is pursuing is not human justice, but only base and selfish interests.
　　However, the wishes of peace-loving people cannot be stifled by the United States. The Soviet Union has already submitted its own draft resolution to the United Nations General Assembly, requesting the United Nations General Assembly to convene an emergency meeting promptly for discussion. At the same time, the Soviet Union has also issued stern warnings directly to the governments of Britain, France and Israel. Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, demanded in a letter to the British and French governments that they immediately cease their aggression and warned that "the Soviet government is determined to use force to destroy the aggressors and restore peace in the East. It is hoped that Eden and Mollet and the British and French governments will, at this critical moment, show the rationality they should have, soberly assess the current situation, and draw appropriate conclusions from it." This warning from the Soviet government is timely and powerful. Our government warned the British and French governments on November 3 to consider the immeasurable serious consequences that would inevitably arise from persisting in aggression. The British and French governments should turn back quickly while there is still time and immediately stop their aggression against Egypt.
　　The United Nations General Assembly has twice adopted resolutions demanding that the belligerents in Egypt immediately cease fire and withdraw their forces behind the Israel-Egypt armistice line. Egypt had already accepted this resolution on November 2. According to reports, Israel also notified the United Nations on November 5 that it unconditionally agreed to a ceasefire. Although Israel has not yet expressed its attitude toward withdrawing to the armistice line, in any case, the whole world can see that only Britain and France are still carrying out naked and barbaric aggression against Egypt. What reason do Britain and France have for not ceasing fire immediately?
　　The aggression carried out by Britain and France has aroused widespread resistance at home and is internationally isolated as never before. In the two votes in the United Nations General Assembly, apart from Israel, only Australia and New Zealand echoed Britain and France. Now, in the face of the Soviet Union's proposals and warnings, Britain and France are not only suffering moral sanctions, but also suffering actual threats. If Britain and France do not cease fire immediately, when will they?
　　Since the invasion of Egypt by Britain, France and Israel, the heroic Egyptian people, with inferior equipment, have valiantly resisted the British, French and Israeli aggressors, giving the aggressors a heavy blow. Peace-loving people all over the world are watching the struggle of the Egyptian people with infinite admiration and respect, and are supporting the Egyptian people with all their strength. The Egyptian people are facing the British, French and Israeli aggressors, and their struggle is arduous. But time is becoming increasingly unfavorable to the British and French aggressors. As long as Egypt can persist in the war of resistance, the British and French governments will inevitably encounter irresistible domestic and international pressure, and will inevitably encounter insurmountable military and political difficulties. They have been politically and morally bankrupt. The voices of opposition to aggression among their domestic people and troops are rising. Their oil in the Middle East has stopped flowing. The Soviet Union's proposals and warnings show that the Soviet Union, the loyal friend of the Middle Eastern people, will never sit idly by regarding the situation in Egypt. The Egyptian people should not be afraid of temporary setbacks and difficulties. Final victory will surely belong to the just, heroic, and world-supported Egypt.

### 英法应该立即停火

    英法应该立即停火
    英、法两国政府不顾世界舆论的警告，蔑视联合国大会通过的立即停火的决议，变本加厉地加紧了对埃及的侵略行动。英、法侵略者这种蛮横已极的态度，使世界和平受到了空前严重的威胁。全世界爱好和平的人民都要求立即采取有效手段制止英、法两国的武装侵略，维护国际法治和人类正义。
    在这个时候，苏联作为强大的和平力量和道义力量，作为同中东的和平和安全有切身关系的大国，顺应着焦虑不安的全世界人民的要求，向美国建议两国紧密合作，立即调用美、苏两国的军队制止英、法的侵略。同时，苏联在联合国安全理事会提出了一项提案，要求立即采取措施制止英、法和以色列的侵略战争。提案中并且要求，如果英、法和以色列不在规定的时间内把军队撤出埃及领土，“联合国所有成员国，首先是拥有强大空军和海军的安全理事会常任理事国美国和苏联，有必要向遭受侵略的埃及共和国提供军事援助和其他援助，即派遣海军和空军、陆军部队、志愿军、教官，供给军事装备或其他种类的援助”。
    苏联向美国提出的建议和在安全理事会提出的提案，充分证明苏联是世界和平和各国人民的自由和独立的最坚决的捍卫者。如果美国和安全理事会接受了苏联的主张，就有可能以全世界的反侵略的力量，使英、法侵略者不得不停止它们对埃及的侵略，结束埃及人民的流血和牺牲，并且消除战火蔓延和扩大的危险。
    但是，苏联的充满正义的建议，竟被美国以荒谬的借口立即加以拒绝。在安全理事会中，美国又同英、法侵略者站在一起，反对苏联的提案，以致这个提案没有能获得通过。美国的这种态度，充分说明，在埃及的危急关头，美国所采取的立场是同英、法一样的殖民主义者的立场。它对于埃及人民的痛苦和牺牲只是说说空话，它所追求的并不是人类正义，而只是卑鄙的自私的利益。
    然而，爱好和平的人民的愿望并不是美国所能扼杀的。苏联已经向联合国大会提出了自己的议案，要求联合国大会迅速召集紧急会议予以讨论。同时，苏联还直接向英、法和以色列政府提出了严厉的警告。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在给英、法政府的信中要求它们立即停止侵略行动，并且警告说，“苏联政府决心使用武力来歼灭侵略者和恢复东方和平。希望艾登和摩勒及英法政府在这紧急关头，能表现出应有的理智，清醒地估计当前局势，并且从中作出适当的结论。”苏联政府的这个警告是及时而有力的。我国政府在11月3日就曾经警告英、法政府，要它们考虑坚持侵略必然会引起的不可估量的严重后果。英、法政府应该在这为时未晚的时候赶快回头，立即停止对埃及的侵略。
    联合国大会已经两次通过决议，要求在埃及的敌对双方立即停火，并把部队撤退到以色列—埃及停战线后面。埃及还在11月2日就已经接受了这一决议。据消息说，以色列在11月5日也已经通知联合国，无条件同意停火。虽然以色列对于撤退到停战线以后还没有表示态度，但是无论如何，全世界都可以看到，只有英法两国还在向埃及进行着赤裸裸的、野蛮的侵略了。英法有什么理由还不立即停火呢？
    英法进行的侵略在国内已经引起广大的反抗，在国际陷于空前的孤立。在联合国大会两次表决中，附和英法的除以色列外，只有澳大利亚和新西兰两国。现在，在苏联的提案和警告面前，英法不仅遭受着道义的制裁，而且遭受着实际的威胁。英法还不立即停火，更待何时？
    从英、法和以色列进犯埃及以来，英雄的埃及人民以劣势的装备，英勇地抗击英、法和以色列侵略者，给了侵略者以沉重的打击。全世界爱好和平的人民都在以无限钦佩和崇敬的心情注视着埃及人民的斗争，并且在以一切力量支援埃及人民。埃及人民面对着英、法、以色列侵略者，他们的斗争是艰苦的。但是时间对于英、法侵略者正在变得愈来愈不利。只要埃及能够坚持抗战，英法政府必将遇到无法抵抗的国内外压力，必将遇到无法解决的军事政治困难。它们在政治上和道义上已经彻底破产。它们国内人民和军队中的反对侵略的呼声正在日益高涨。它们在中东的石油已经停流。苏联的提案和警告，表示中东人民的忠实友人苏联决不会对于埃及的局势坐视不理。埃及人民不要怕暂时的挫折和困难，最后胜利一定属于正义的、英雄的、得到全世界支持的埃及。
