    Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Position in Modern Chinese History
    – Commemorating the Ninetieth Anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth –
    Deng Chumin
    In the modern history of the Chinese democratic revolution, it was divided into the revolutionary faction and the reformist faction from the beginning. The revolutionary faction, headed by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, inherited the revolutionary tradition of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and pioneered the New Democratic Revolution; the reformist faction, headed by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, inherited the tradition of the Westernization Movement of Li Hongzhang and Zhang Zhidong, and laid the foundation for the constitutional monarchists before and after the 1911 Revolution.
    The revolutionary faction, headed by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, founded the Xingzhonghui in Honolulu in 1894 (the year of the Sino-Japanese War), and launched the Xingzhonghui's newspaper "China Daily," competing with the royalist party's newspaper "Qingyi Bao." At the same time, based on his experience and insights from years of investigations and activities in Europe, America, and Japan, Mr. Sun Yat-sen began to put forward the Three People's Principles. He once said: "After escaping from London, I stayed in Europe to investigate its political customs and interact with its virtuous and heroic figures in both the government and the opposition. In the past two years, I have gained a lot of experience and realized that even if a country is rich and powerful and its people's rights are developed like the European powers, it still cannot bring its people to a land of ultimate bliss. Therefore, European patriots still have a social revolution movement. I want to make a once-and-for-all plan, so I adopted the Principle of People's Livelihood to solve it simultaneously with the issues of nationalism and democracy. This is how the Three People's Principles were completed." Later, in 1905, the Xingzhonghui merged with the "Guangfuhui" (headed by Zhang Taiyan) and the "Huaxinghui" (headed by Huang Xing) to form the Revolutionary Alliance, proposing the revolutionary program of "Expelling the Tartars, restoring China, establishing a republic, and equalizing land ownership," and pointed out in the declaration: "In addition to expelling the Tartars and restoring China, the state system and the people's livelihood still need to be changed. Although there are myriad details, the consistent spirit is 'freedom,' 'equality,' and 'fraternity.' Therefore, the previous generation was a heroic revolution, and today is a national revolution. The so-called national revolution is that the people of a country all have the spirit of 'freedom,' 'equality,' and 'fraternity,' that is, they all bear the responsibility of revolution, and the military government is only its organ. From now on, the responsibility of the people is the responsibility of the military government; the功绩of the military government is the功绩of the people. The military government and the people work together to fulfill their responsibilities."
    According to the Three People's Principles, the program and declaration of the Tongmenghui proposed by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, it already has the ideas of a modern bourgeois democratic revolution, which is to replace the old feudal rule with a bourgeois democratic republic. The proposal of the slogan "Principle of People's Livelihood" and "Equalization of Land Ownership," although it did not really solve any social problems and land problems at that time, still has its important practical significance. Because at that time, the three major issues of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood were indeed universal problems that all Chinese people in semi-colonial and semi-feudal society had to solve urgently. The Tongmenghui marked the establishment of a national bourgeois revolutionary party in modern Chinese history. Any revolutionary class, without a revolutionary party to lead it, cannot carry out the revolution; any revolutionary party, without a revolutionary, outstanding, and wise leader to lead it, cannot carry out the revolution. Historical materialism does not deny the role of individuals in the development of history, let alone deny the great role of a great leader of a revolutionary party in the development of history.
  "The meaning of party organization and leadership lies in cultivating the necessary knowledge, the necessary experience, and the necessary - in addition to knowledge and experience - political vigilance, in order to quickly and correctly solve complex political problems." (See Lenin's "Left-Wing Communism: an Infantile Disorder"). Mr. Sun Yat-sen was such a leader at that time. Since there was a revolutionary party led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, a clear revolutionary program was put forward. Lenin called it "the program of the great Chinese democrats." He also pointed out that Mr. Sun Yat-sen already fully understood the inadequacy of racial revolution, directly raised the issue of the people's living conditions, the issue of mass struggle, and expressed warm sympathy for the laborers and the exploited, which was far-sighted.
    The national bourgeois revolutionary faction headed by Mr. Sun Yat-sen not only led the national bourgeoisie to rise up in revolution at that time, but also led the urban petty bourgeoisie, peasants, intellectuals, and vagrant proletariat to rise up in revolution. Mr. Sun Yat-sen at that time attached great importance to the revolutionary forces of the "secret societies" and the "New Army." At the same time, he also mobilized some peasants, but often not directly, but indirectly, and the mobilization was also very insufficient. Even some anti-tax and anti-tax movements, anti-loan road construction and mining movements, and endless missionary cases were not well utilized. But this did not prevent the success of the 1911 Revolution; nor did it damage Mr. Sun Yat-sen's position in modern Chinese history. Mr. Sun Yat-sen in modern Chinese history is always a great democrat and revolutionary, he represents an era - from the Opium War to the May Fourth Movement.
    The 1911 Revolution was the first bourgeois democratic revolution in modern Chinese history, and it was a success. It had its successful aspects, which was to overthrow the oldest autocratic emperor political system in Chinese history and also in world history, and opened up a new era of democratic republics in China and Asia. This has great significance for the later development of Chinese history, and also has great significance for the oppressed and exploited nations in Asia and Africa in their struggle for national independence, that is, the anti-colonialist movement. Even for the development of world history, it has great significance, which is its first successful aspect.
    The second successful aspect of the 1911 Revolution is that it broke the "national prison" of the Qing government's rule over the Chinese people. This "national prison" was not only needed by the Qing government to maintain its long-term rule in China, but also needed by the evil imperialist powers to maintain their long-term rule in China. Therefore, breaking this "national prison" also meant pointing the spearhead of the democratic revolution first at the revolutionary call for anti-Qing struggle. Under the objective historical conditions at that time, it cannot be said that it was a correct step. Although the emphasis on anti-Qing let go of a real enemy - imperialism, and because the anti-Qing was oversimplified, it let go of a real enemy - feudal forces, but that was limited by the historical conditions at that time, otherwise, it would not be possible to form a very broad anti-Qing national united front, and the task of anti-Qing could not be realized. Only after the task of anti-Qing was first realized and the "national prison" was broken, could the Chinese people come out, pick up the weapons of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and continue to struggle. Therefore, the 1911 Revolution was by no means just a matter of cutting a few braids, as later people said.
    Naturally, the 1911 Revolution had its successful aspects, and it also had its failures, that is to say, it only realized the first half of its revolutionary program, "Expelling the Tartars, restoring China," but did not realize the second half of its revolutionary program, "Establishing a republic, equalizing land ownership," and the failure was more than the success. Because after the 1911 Revolution, the Northern Warlord Yuan Shikai replaced the rule of the Qing government, and imperialism and feudal forces were not only not overthrown, but, as Lenin said in his article "Backward Europe and Advanced Asia" in 1913, foreign imperialism was uniting with all the dark retrogressive forces in China to restrain and oppress China, making the historical demand for opening up the road to independent development of Chinese national capitalism stillborn; and the entire Chinese people, due to the betrayal of the Northern Warlords, were still, and even further, living a dark and miserable life under the enslavement of imperialism and the exploitation of feudal forces. This runs counter to the main tasks that the 1911 Revolution wanted to complete, that is, to develop Chinese capitalism and establish a bourgeois democratic republic. This is where it failed. Its failure was also limited by the historical conditions at that time, because at the beginning of the 20th century, the powers of capitalism had entered the imperialist stage of its final stage, and would not allow China to take the capitalist road again. The awakening of the Chinese nation, especially the gradual transformation of the Chinese working class from a "class in itself" to a "class for itself" and its entry into the political arena, also did not allow China to take the capitalist road again. This is the objective law of historical development.
    The failure of the 1911 Revolution did not damage Mr. Sun Yat-sen's position in modern Chinese history. On the contrary, the lessons of this failure made Mr. Sun Yat-sen reorganize the Chinese Kuomintang in 1924 and reinterpret his Three People's Principles. And clearly put forward the tasks of the Chinese revolution against imperialism and feudalism and the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, so that the revolutionary Three People's Principles reached a basic consensus in principle with the New Democracy put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, thus establishing an alliance with the Chinese Communist Party against imperialism and feudalism, and for the first time forming a people's democratic united front led by the working class, and launched a new revolutionary struggle.
    "Taking Russia as a teacher" and "Following the path of the Russians" are important signs of the development of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thought. The revolutionary tasks that Mr. Sun Yat-sen did not complete, and the revolutionary ideals that he did not realize, are now all completed and realized by the Chinese people's revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party. That is, in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese People to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and established thePeople's Republic of China, thoroughly completing the bourgeois democratic revolution; and in the second half of 1955 and the first half of 1956, the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to achieve a comprehensive and decisive victory in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, that is, to achieve a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. Commemorating the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth in the midst of the jubilant voices of victory has its indelible historical significance.
    Our domestic and foreign enemies have not been completely eliminated, our Taiwan has not been liberated, we must not only learn from the 1911 Revolution, but also from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of daring to criticize himself and constantly pursuing progress, closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao, and strive for the construction of socialism, for the defense of world peace, especially for supporting Egypt and stopping the invasion of the Anglo-French bandits, and push the anti-colonialist movement to its peak.
    Our study of modern Chinese history and Mr. Sun Yat-sen's position in modern Chinese history is to clearly understand: what historical tasks we have struggled for in the past, what historical tasks we are struggling for now, and what historical tasks we will struggle for in the future.
    Comrades, friends: Clearly recognize that the main body of history is the people, firmly grasp the objective laws of historical development, and transform history from understanding history. This is the most precious and most lofty gift we can offer to commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth.

    孙中山先生在中国近代史上的地位
    ——纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年——
    邓初民
    在中国民主革命的近代史中，一开始就分为革命派和改良派。革命派以孙中山先生为首，上承太平天国革命传统，下开新民主主义革命的先河；改良派以康有为、梁启超为首，上承李鸿章、张之洞洋务运动传统，下为辛亥革命前后君主立宪派奠立了基础。
    以孙中山先生为首的革命派，1894年（即甲午战争之年），成立兴中会于檀香山，创刊兴中会的机关报“中国报”，与保皇党的机关报“清议报”相争辩。同时，孙中山先生根据几年来在欧、美、日本各国考察的心得与活动的经验，开始提出了三民主义的主张，他曾说：“伦敦脱险后，则暂留欧洲，以实行考察其政治风俗，并接交其朝野贤豪。两年之中，所见所闻，殊多心得，始知徒致国家富强，民权发达如欧洲列强者，犹未能登斯民于极乐之乡也。是以欧洲志士，犹有社会革命之运动也。予欲为一劳永逸之计，乃采取民生主义，以与民族、民权问题，同时解决，此三民主义之主张所由完成也。”后于1905年，兴中会即与“光复会”（以章太炎为首）、“华兴会”（以黄兴为首）合并，组织革命同盟会，提出了“驱除鞑虏、恢复中华，建立民国、平均地权”的革命纲领，并在宣言中指出：“于驱除鞑虏，恢复中华之外，国体民生，尚待变更，虽经纬万端，要其一贯之精神则为‘自由’
  ‘平等’‘博爱’；故前代为英雄革命，今日为国民革命。所谓国民革命者，一国之人皆有‘自由’‘平等’‘博爱’之精神，即皆负革命之责任，军政府特为其机关而已。自今以往，国民之责任，即军政府之责任；军政府之功，即国民之功。军政府与国民同心协力，以尽责任。”
    根据孙中山先生所提出的三民主义、同盟会的纲领和宣言，已具有现代资产阶级民主革命的思想，正是要以资产阶级的民主共和国代替旧的封建统治。“民生主义”和“平均地权”这个口号的提出，虽然并不曾真正解决当时什么社会问题和土地问题，但仍有它重要的现实意义。因为当时民族、民权、民生三大问题，确是半殖民地半封建社会的全体中国人民身上所要迫切解决的普遍问题。同盟会标志着中国近代史上一个民族资产阶级革命政党的树立。任何一个革命的阶级，如果没有一个革命的政党来领导，革命是不可能进行的；任何一个革命的政党，如果没有一个革命的、杰出的、英明的领袖来领导，革命也是不可能进行的。历史唯物主义并没有否认个人在历史发展中的作用，更没有否认一个革命政党的伟大领袖在历史发展中的伟大作用。
  “党的组织与领袖的意义，即在于锻炼出必需的知识，必需的经验，必需的——除了知识与经验外——政治警觉力，以便迅速地正确地解决复杂的政治问题。”（见列宁著“左派幼稚病”）孙中山先生在当时就是这样的一个领袖。自从有了以孙中山先生为领袖的革命政党，才提出了明确的革命纲领。列宁曾把它称为“伟大的中国民主派的纲领”。他并且指出：孙中山先生已经完全懂得种族革命之不够，直接提出民众生活状况问题，群众斗争问题，对劳动者与被剥削者表示热烈的同情，是具有远见的。
    以孙中山先生为首的民族资产阶级革命派，当时不仅领导了民族资产阶级起来革命，而且也领导了城市小资产阶级、农民、知识分子及游民无产阶级起来革命。孙中山先生当时是很看重“会党”与“新军”的革命力量的，同时，也发动了一部分农民，不过往往不是直接的，而是间接的，而且发动的也很不够，甚至有些抗捐、抗税运动，反对借款筑路、开矿运动，层出不穷的教案运动，都没有好好利用。但这并没有阻止辛亥革命的成功；也没有损害孙中山先生在中国近代史上的地位。孙中山先生在中国近代史上，总是一个伟大的民主主义的革命家，他代表着一个时代——从鸦片战争到五四运动这一个时代。
    辛亥革命是中国近代史上第一次的资产阶级民主革命，而且取得了胜利，有它成功的地方，这就是推翻了中国历史上而且也是世界历史上最古老的专制皇帝政治制度，开辟了中国和亚洲民主共和国的新纪元，这对于中国后来历史的发展有很大的意义，对于亚非两洲被压迫、被剥削的民族，争取民族独立运动亦即反殖民主义运动，也有很大的意义。甚至对于世界历史的发展，都有很大的意义，这是它第一个成功的地方。
    辛亥革命的第二个成功的地方，是在它打破了清朝政府统治中国人民的“民族牢狱”，这一“民族牢狱”不仅是清朝政府为了维持其在中国的长期统治所需要的，而且是万恶的帝国主义列强为要维持其在华的长期统治所需要的。因此打破这个“民族牢狱”，也就是把民主革命的矛头首先指向反清斗争的革命号召。这在当时客观的历史条件上，不能不说是一个正确的步骤。虽然由于强调反清，放走了一个真正敌人——帝国主义，又由于把反清过于简单化了，又放走了一个真正的敌人——封建势力，但那是受了当时的历史条件所限制的，否则，就不能结成很广泛的反清民族统一战线，不能实现反清的任务，反帝反封建就根本谈不到。只有首先实现了反清的任务，打破了这座“民族牢狱”以后，中国人民才能走出来，拿起反帝反封建的武器，继续斗争下去。因此辛亥革命决不是像后来人们所说的那样只剪了几条辫子就完事。
    自然，辛亥革命有它成功的地方，也有它失败的地方，这就是说，它只实现了它革命纲领的上一半，“驱除鞑虏，恢复中华”，而没有实现它革命纲领的下一半，“建立民国，平均地权”，而且失败是多于成功的。因为在辛亥革命以后，北洋军阀袁世凯代替了清朝政府的统治，帝国主义和封建势力不仅没有被推翻，而且正像列宁于1913年在他所写的“落后的欧洲与先进的亚洲”一文中说过的一样，外国帝国主义正与中国一切黑暗复古势力联合着来羁轭和压迫中国，使开辟中国民族资本主义独立发展道路的历史要求又成了流产；而整个中国民众且由于北洋军阀的出卖，依然并进一步在帝国主义的奴役下，封建势力的榨取下，度着黑暗凄惨的生活。这是与辛亥革命所要完成的主要任务，亦即发展中国资本主义，建立资产阶级民主共和国的任务背道而驰的。这就是它失败的地方。它的失败，也是受到当时历史条件的限制的，因为二十世纪初列强资本主义已进入它的最后阶段的帝国主义，不容许中国再走资本主义的路。中国民族的觉醒特别是中国工人阶级已逐步由“自在的阶级”转变为
  “自为的阶级”而走上了政治舞台，也不容许中国再走资本主义的路。这是历史发展的客观规律。
    辛亥革命的失败，并没有损害孙中山先生在中国近代史上的地位。反之，这种失败的教训，却使得孙中山先生在1924年改组了中国国民党，重新解释了他的三民主义。并明确的提出了中国革命反帝反封建的任务和联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策，使革命的三民主义同中国共产党所提出来的新民主主义在原则上达到了基本的一致，因而同中国共产党建立了反帝反封建的联盟，第一次结成了以工人阶级领导的人民民主统一战线，展开了新的革命斗争。
    “以俄为师”，“走俄国人的路”，是孙中山先生思想发展的重要标志。孙中山先生所没有完成的革命任务，和他所没有实现的革命理想，今天，都由中国共产党所领导的中国人民革命，一一完成了，一一实现了。这就是1949年中国共产党领导中国人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治，建立了中华人民共和国，彻底完成了资产阶级的民主革命；又在1955年下半年和1956年上半年中国共产党领导中国人民取得了农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的全面的决定性的胜利，也就是取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利。在万众欢腾的胜利声中来纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年，这是有它不可磨灭的历史意义的。
    我们国内外的敌人还没有完全消灭，我们的台湾还没有解放，我们不仅要从辛亥革命中取得教训，我们还要从孙中山先生勇于批判自己和不断追求进步的精神中，紧密地团结在以毛主席为首的中国共产党的周围，为建设社会主义、为保卫世界和平、特别为要支援埃及、制止英法强盗的侵略，把反殖民主义的运动推进到最高峰而奋斗。
    我们研究中国近代史和孙中山先生在中国近代史上的地位，就是为着要认识清楚：过去我们曾为什么历史任务而奋斗过，现在正在为着什么历史任务而奋斗，将来还要为着什么历史任务而奋斗。
    同志们，朋友们：明确认识历史的主体是人民，牢牢掌握历史发展的客观规律，从认识历史到改造历史。这才是我们纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年最珍贵、最崇高的献礼。
