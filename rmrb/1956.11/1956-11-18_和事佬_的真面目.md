    The True Face of the "Peacemaker"
    Hu Ping
    The attitude of the US government in the Middle East situation of protecting and supporting the British and French aggressors has now become increasingly obvious, arousing more and more attention; because this has become an important factor in promoting the continued deterioration of the Middle East situation, and even re-igniting the war.
    When Britain, France, and Israel began their offensive against Egypt, the US government adopted a two-faced attitude. On the one hand, it joined the vast majority of countries inside and outside the United Nations in expressing opposition to the armed aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, and preemptively proposed a ceasefire resolution in the United Nations, playing the "peacemaker" in front of world public opinion; but on the other hand, in its actual actions, it not only had no intention of stopping the British and French aggressors, but also took various measures to weaken Egypt's power to resist aggression, and attempted to obstruct the just actions of peace-loving countries and people to aid Egypt and stop the aggression.
    The first measure taken by the US government when Britain, France, and Israel launched their war of aggression against Egypt was not to try to stop the aggression, but to announce the suspension of the transport of military supplies to Egypt and Israel, while stating that it would not interrupt military aid to Britain and France. This action by the United States was clearly detrimental to Egypt and beneficial to the British and French aggressors. Subsequently, at the meeting of the United Nations Security Council on November 5, the United States openly stood with the British and French aggressors, voting against the Security Council taking emergency measures to stop the aggression. At the same time, the US government rejected the Soviet Union's proposal for joint action by the US and the Soviet Union to restore peace in the Middle East. Currently, just as the British and French aggressors are violating the UN General Assembly resolution, refusing to withdraw their troops from Egypt, and continuing to gather forces in Port Said to prepare to restart the war, the US government has repeatedly claimed its opposition to countries supporting volunteer personnel entering the Middle East to assist Egypt in resisting aggression, and at the same time ordered a ban on US citizens volunteering to support Egypt. The United States is conducting activities in the United Nations, attempting to create a resolution prohibiting volunteer personnel from entering Egypt, placing Egypt in a position of isolation and helplessness in the face of powerful enemies, in order to benefit the British and French aggressors in doing whatever they want in Egypt.
    What is even more noteworthy is that the United States is now massively transferring troops and generals, moving a huge fleet from the US West Coast to the Mediterranean and the Western Pacific, and conducting war preparations at US military bases in Europe and Asia. This is clearly intimidating Egypt and Arab countries, as well as all countries and peoples willing to support Egypt in resisting aggression, and emboldening the British and French aggressors.
    The US government's two-faced approach, saying one thing and doing another, on the Middle East situation is not accidental. Because, although the United States has contradictions and differences with Britain and France on the issue of aggression against Egypt, the basic goals are the same. That is: to work together to seize control of the Suez Canal, thwart Egypt's just actions to safeguard national sovereignty, and use this to intimidate other Arab and Asian-African countries, in order to re-establish a colonialist system in the Near and Middle East.
    Everyone remembers that in the early stages of the Suez Canal issue, the attitudes of the United States, Britain, and France were the same. At the two London conferences, the United States took the lead in proposing the so-called "Dulles Plan" and the "Users' Association Plan," and, together with Britain and France, exerted crude pressure on Egypt. Therefore, the differences between the United States and Britain and France are only differences in the means and steps of how to force Egypt to submit. Britain and France initially attempted to seize the canal through armed adventure, and reorganize their colonialist flags in the Middle East; while the US government attempted to appear as a "peacemaker." In the eyes of the United States, it is more beneficial for it to bargain on the canal issue than to participate in combat. Because this can take the opportunity to expand its influence in the Middle East, squeeze out the colonial interests of Britain and France, and replace them. But even at that time, the United States did not completely disagree with Britain and France's plans for some kind of adventure. The most obvious fact is that the US government and oil monopoly groups, under the pretext of preparing to "boycott" the Suez Canal, completed an "emergency plan for transporting oil to Europe without going through the Suez Canal" in a very short period of time (including repairing a batch of reserve oil tankers, expanding oil production in the Americas, etc.). This US oil plan played a major role in encouraging Britain and France to take adventurous actions.
    After Britain and France colluded with Israel to launch an armed invasion of Egypt, the United States fell into extremely acute contradictions. Because at that time the US election had entered a decisive moment, if the Republican government adventurously fought alongside Britain and France, then the "peace" banner on which it relied to win over voters would be completely bankrupt; and if the United States stayed out of it, then the result of the war, whether Britain and France succeeded or failed, would be unfavorable to the United States. According to US officials, the original expectation of Britain and France was that they could occupy the Suez Canal Zone in a very short period of time, destroy the national governments of Egypt and other Arab countries, and they had even drafted plans to divide up certain Arab countries. If this fantasy could become a reality, it would greatly threaten the position of the United States in the Middle East, and the results of its years of painstaking efforts to squeeze out Britain and France would be taken away by Britain and France. But the United States is even more worried that if Britain and France suffer major setbacks in the war of aggression against Egypt, it will weaken the strength of the entire imperialist camp and endanger the colonial interests of the United States in the Middle East.
    Due to this situation, Eisenhower quickly claimed on October 31 that the United States was "not involved" in the war, and demanded that the "fighting be localized" and "the conflict be ended," continuing to play the role of "peacemaker." Later, seeing that Britain and France had been resolutely resisted by the Egyptian army and people, and had been strongly opposed by their own people and the whole world, especially after the Soviet government issued serious warnings to Britain and France, the situation of Britain and France became increasingly unfavorable, so the United States gradually revealed its biased and protective attitude towards the aggressors. Since the US election has passed, a chorus of renewed unity and concerted action has been issued between the US, Britain, and France.
    Until now, the US government has never condemned Britain and France's aggression against Egypt, nor has it actively urged Britain, France, and Israel to implement the United Nations resolution to immediately withdraw their troops from Egypt; on the contrary, its actions are to resist the pressure on the British and French aggressors by various means, and it is particularly keen to confuse the issue of British and French troop withdrawal with the resolution of the Suez Canal issue. It is not difficult to see that the current attempt of the United States is to use the fact that Britain and France forcibly occupy part of Egyptian territory and intensify the threat to Middle East peace as capital to pressure Egypt to make concessions, in order to achieve the goal of international control of the Suez Canal that the US, Britain, and France could not achieve originally.
    It must be pointed out that it is as unrealistic for Britain and France to hope to rely on the protection and support of the United States to achieve the goals they failed to achieve in the war after being forced to cease fire as it was for them to have that beautiful fantasy before launching the war. Egypt and the other eight Arab countries have united as one, and they have expressed their firm determination to have Britain, France, and Israel withdraw their troops quickly and defend Egypt's sovereignty; the powerful strength of other countries that are determined to support Egypt in resisting aggression cannot be stopped by the intimidation of the United States. Some people in the United States and Britain and France are currently trying to use slander against Egypt to divide the unity of Arab countries, and use the smoke screen of anti-communism to divide the unity between the anti-aggression forces of the world. Facts have proved that this can only be a fantasy. All anti-aggression forces in the world are not only paying attention to the movements of Britain and France in Egypt, but will also be especially vigilant about the insidious tricks played by the United States wearing the mask of a "peacemaker."

    “和事佬”的真面目
    胡平
    美国政府在中东局势问题上所采取的庇护和支持英法侵略者的态度，现在已经日益明显，引起了人们越来越大的注意；因为这已成为促使中东局势继续恶化，甚至重新引起战争的重要因素。
    在英法和以色列开始进攻埃及的时候，美国政府是采取两面态度的。一方面，它和联合国内外的绝大多数国家一道，表示反对英法和以色列对埃及的武装进攻，并且在联合国抢先提出要求停火的提案，在世界舆论面前装“和事佬”；但另一方面，它在实际行动上，却不但无意制止英法侵略者，而且采取各种措施来削弱埃及反抗侵略的力量，并且企图阻挠爱好和平的国家和人民援助埃及、制止侵略的正义行动。
    就在英法以三国发动对埃及的侵略战争开始时美国政府所采取的第一个措施，也不是设法来制止侵略，而是宣布停止向埃及和以色列运送军事物资，同时表示不中断给英法以军事援助。美国这个行动，显然不利于埃及，而有利于英法侵略者。随后，在联合国安全理事会11月5日的会议上，美国竟公开地和英法侵略者站在一起，投票反对安理会采取制止侵略的紧急措施。同时，美国政府拒绝了苏联提出的由美苏两国采取联合行动来恢复中东和平的建议。目前，正当英法侵略者违反联大决议，拒不从埃及撤兵，并在塞得港继续集聚兵力、准备重启战端的时候，美国政府竟一再声称反对各国支援埃及反抗侵略的志愿人员进入中东，同时下令禁止美国公民志愿支援埃及。美国正在联合国内进行活动，企图搞出一个禁止志愿人员进入埃及的决议，使埃及在强敌压境的形势下处于孤立无援的地位，以利于英法侵略者在埃及为所欲为。
    更值得注意的，是美国现在正在大量地调兵遣将，从美国西海岸把庞大的舰队调到地中海和西太平洋，并在欧亚各地的美国军事基地进行战争准备。这显然是在向埃及和阿拉伯国家以及一切愿意支援埃及反抗侵略的国家和人民施行恫吓，为英法侵略者壮胆。
    美国政府在中东局势问题上采取这种口是心非的两面做法，不是偶然的。因为，美国同英法两国在侵略埃及的问题上虽然有着矛盾和分歧，可是基本的目的却是一致的。那就是：合力夺取苏伊士运河的控制权，挫败埃及维护民族主权的正义行动，并借此威吓其他阿拉伯国家和亚非国家，以便在中近东重新建立殖民主义制度。
    大家还记得，在苏伊士运河问题发生的初期，美国和英法的态度是相同的。在两次伦敦会议上，美国带头提出了所谓“杜勒斯计划”和“使用国协会计划”，和英法一道向埃及施加了粗暴的压力。因此，美国和英法的分歧只是在如何迫使埃及屈服的手段和步骤上的分歧。英法两国一开始就企图以武装冒险来夺取运河，重整它们在中东的殖民主义旗鼓；而美国政府则企图以“和事佬”姿态出现。在美国看来，它在运河问题上采取讨价还价，比参加作战对它更有利。因为这可以乘机扩大它在中东的影响，排挤英法的殖民利益，取而代之。但是，即使在那个时候，美国也并不是完全不同意英法作某种冒险的打算的。一个最明显的事实是：美国政府和石油垄断集团以所谓准备“抵制”苏伊士运河为借口，在很短的时间内完成了一个“不经苏伊士运河而向欧洲运输石油的紧急计划”（包括修理一批后备油船、扩大美洲的石油生产等）。美国的这个石油计划，对于鼓励英法采取冒险行动是起了重大作用的。
    在英法勾结以色列发动对埃及的武装侵略之后，美国陷入了极尖锐的矛盾之中。因为当时美国大选已进入决定性的时刻，共和党政府如果随同英法冒险作战，那末它赖以笼络选民的“和平”幌子就会完全破产；而如果美国置身事外，那么战争的结果无论是英法得逞或失利都对美国不利。据美国官方人士透露，英法两国原来预想的结果是它们可以在极短的时间内占领苏伊士运河区，摧毁埃及和其他阿拉伯国家的民族政府，它们甚至已经拟定了瓜分某些阿拉伯国家的计划。这个幻想如果能成为事实，对美国在中东的地位威胁很大，它多年来苦心排挤英法所取得的成果就会被英法夺去。但美国更担心的是英法如果在侵埃战争中遭到重大挫折，那就会削弱整个帝国主义阵营的力量，并且危及美国在中东的殖民利益。
      由于这种形势，所以艾森豪威尔在10月31日赶紧声称美国“不卷入”战争，并且要求“战斗局部化”和“结束冲突”，继续扮做“和事佬”的角色。以后看到英法受到了埃及军民的坚决抗击，遭到了它们国内人民和全世界的强烈反对，特别是苏联政府向英法提出严重警告之后，英法的处境越发不利，这样，美国就逐渐露出褊袒侵略者的本相来了。由于美国的大选已过，美英法之间已发出一片重新团结，一致行动的喊声。
    直到目前为止，美国政府从来没有谴责过英法对埃及的侵略行动，也不积极督促英法和以色列执行立即从埃及撤军的联合国决议；相反地，它的行动是以各种办法来抵挡英法侵略者所受到的压力，并且特别热衷于要把英法撤兵的问题同苏伊士运河问题的解决混淆到一起。不难看出，美国目前的企图是想以英法强占一部分埃及领土和加紧威胁中东和平为资本，压迫埃及让步，以实现美英法原来所不能达到的国际管制苏伊士运河的目的。
    必须指出，英法两国在被迫停火之后，还希望依靠美国的庇护和支持来达到它们在战争中所未能达到的目的，这是同它们在发动战争前所抱的那种美妙幻想一样不现实的。埃及和其他八个阿拉伯国家已经团结一致，它们表示了要英法和以色列迅速撤兵和捍卫埃及主权的坚定的决心；其他决心支援埃及反抗侵略的国家的强大力量，也绝不是美国的恫吓所能挡得住的。美国和英法的某些人目前力图用诽谤埃及的办法来分化阿拉伯国家的团结，用反共的烟幕来分化全世界反侵略力量之间的团结，事实证明这只能是一种幻想。全世界的一切反侵略力量不但注意着英法在埃及的动静，而且将特别警惕着美国披着“和事佬”的外衣玩弄的阴险诡计。
