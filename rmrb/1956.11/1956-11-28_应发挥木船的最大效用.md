    Maximize the Effectiveness of Wooden Boats

    Currently, the utilization rate of wooden boats on the Yangtze River is very low. Many wooden boats have no goods to transport, and the phenomenon of returning empty is also serious. For example, many materials transported from Sichuan to other provinces are transported by wooden boats to Yichang and then transferred to steamers. These wooden boats are mostly empty when they return from Yichang. However, the Yichang Port Authority has goods that cannot be shipped out.

    Why does this phenomenon of the busy being busy and the idle being idle occur? The main reason is that the material consignment units and other relevant departments have not paid attention to the utilization of wooden boats, or they do not trust wooden boats enough, thinking that wooden boats are slow, the freight is high, and the danger is great. In fact, these are not problems. Although steamers are faster than wooden boats, the current backlog of materials in ports and the long waiting time for ships sometimes make them slower than wooden boats. For example, the pickled mustard tuber that the Fengjie Trading Company transported to Yichang waited a month for a steamer but could not be loaded. Later, it was still transported by wooden boats. If it had been shipped by wooden boats earlier, it would have been a month faster. In terms of freight, steamers classify goods and calculate the freight by grade, while wooden boats calculate it by tonnage. Large boats have lower freight unit prices, and small boats have higher freight unit prices. There is a return freight fee for no return cargo, but if there is a return cargo, there is no return freight fee in either direction. If you understand the freight calculation methods of steamers and wooden boats and calculate and compare the two, you can save some money on using wooden boats, and it is not necessarily more expensive than steamer freight. As for the danger of wooden boats, I believe that it can be avoided as long as attention is paid to safety measures.

    Therefore, I hope that material consignment units and relevant departments will pay attention to using wooden boat transportation. Wooden boats can be used for anything that steamers cannot transport in a timely manner. Materials transported from Sichuan to Hankou can also be transported directly by wooden boats. This can not only reduce the burden on intermediate ports, but also reduce the burden on destination ports, because wooden boats can still load cargo from the destination port to return, reducing the backlog of materials in ports. In order to ensure better cooperation between steamers and wooden boats in transportation, it is best for the wooden boat shipping management department and the port department to establish some necessary contact systems.

### 应发挥木船的最大效用

    应发挥木船的最大效用
    目前，长江航线上的木船利用率很低，很多木船无货运，回空现象也严重。如在四川运出省外的物资，很多都是以木船运至宜昌转轮船，这些木船到宜昌后大都是空着回去，但是，宜昌港务局却又存着货运不出去。
    为什么会出现这种忙的忙、闲的闲的现象呢？主要是由于物资托运单位等有关部门没有注意对木船的利用，或对木船还不够信任，认为木船慢，运费高，危险大等。其实这些并不是问题。轮船虽然比木船快，但目前港口物资积压多和候船时间长，有时就不如木船快了。如奉节贸易公司运往宜昌的大头菜，要了一个月的轮船，没装到，后来还是用木船运出了，如果早用木船装运，还快一个月的时间。在运费方面，轮船是将货物分类论级计费，木船则以吨位算，船大运费单价低，船小运费单价高；无回头货计回空费，若是顺载及有回头货，来去都不计回空费。如果懂得轮船和木船运费计算办法，两者加以计算考较，在使用木船运费上是可以节省一些的，不一定比轮船运费高。至于说木船危险，我认为，只要注意安全措施是可以避免的。
    因此，希望物资托运单位及有关部门注意利用木船运输，凡轮船不能及时承运的可给木船运。从四川运往汉口的物资，也可以利用木船直运，这样不仅可减轻中途港的负担，同时也可以减轻目的港的负担，因为木船仍可从目的港装载货物返回，减少港口物资积压。为了保证轮船木船在运输上能更好地配合，木船航运管理部门与港务部门，最好能建立一些必要的联系制度。　　　　　　　　秦大明
