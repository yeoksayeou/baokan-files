Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th: This year, over four thousand people in Shanghai who had lost items recovered them at the city's bus depots, rickshaw management offices, and People's Amusement Park.

Among these items were gold-cased watches, fountain pens, savings deposit slips worth hundreds or thousands of yuan, fans, umbrellas, and handkerchiefs.

These items were found by ticket sellers, rickshaw workers, People's Police, and some citizens in various public places.

The bus depot has specially set aside two lost-and-found rooms for owners of lost property. Cao Guoqing, an outstanding worker who also manages the lost-and-found room at the First Depot, patiently categorizes and numbers the large number of lost items to make it easier for owners to claim them. For some lost items that do not contain the owner's name or address, Cao Guoqing contacts the bank to inquire about the owner's whereabouts based on the savings deposit slip account number; or he carefully examines and studies a few written-on pieces of paper and seemingly unimportant receipts and IOUs in the lost items, and finds the owner through his work unit, relatives, and friends.

Many rickshaw workers often, during their service hours, ride their rickshaws to deliver lost items to the owner's home. One rainy night, a female passenger, carrying her purchased goods, hurriedly jumped off the rickshaw and returned home. She discovered that the black handbag she was carrying was missing. The handbag contained over 20,000 yuan in bank deposit slips, as well as cash, seals, and fountain pens. She couldn't remember where she lost the handbag and searched anxiously at home, unable to eat dinner. At this time, Yan Yicai, the rickshaw worker who found the handbag on his rickshaw, also had no appetite for dinner. He gave up his business and braved the heavy rain for five li to take the handbag to the neighborhood committee near his residence. He and the neighborhood committee cadres searched repeatedly through the lost items and finally found the owner's name and address on an envelope in the handbag. When the owner, Zhao Huizhen, went to the rickshaw management office to collect the handbag, she offered Yan Yicai some rewards as a memento, but Yan Yicai repeatedly refused to accept them.

Yan Yicai has personally returned fountain pens, raincoats, keys, and other items to their owners many times, and he recently received a special award from the Shanghai Rickshaw Management Authority for this.

In various public places in Shanghai, the "Beware of Pickpockets" signs are no longer visible; instead, they have been replaced by many letters and banners from owners of lost property praising the act of finding and returning lost property.

### “拾金不昧”的锦旗代替了“谨防扒手”的牌子  上海四千多人领回了失物

    “拾金不昧”的锦旗代替了“谨防扒手”的牌子
    上海四千多人领回了失物
    新华社上海25日电　四千多个遗失东西的人，今年在上海市公共汽车车场、三轮车管理所和人民游乐场领回了失物。
    这些物件中有金壳手表、钢笔、成百上千元的储蓄存款单、扇子、雨伞和手帕等。
    这些物件是售票员、三轮车工人、人民警察和一些市民在各个公共场所拾到的。
    公共汽车车场为失主专辟了两间失物保管室。兼管第一车场失物保管室工作的是优秀工作者曹国庆，他耐心地把大量失物分类编号，以便利失主前来认领。有些失物中没有失主的姓名、地址，曹国庆就根据失物中的储蓄存款单帐号，向银行查问失主下落；或者根据失物中几张写过的信纸和看起来是无关紧要的发票、借据，进行仔细察看、研究，通过失主的工作单位、亲戚朋友找到失主。
    很多三轮车工人常常在服务时间内，踏着车，把失物送到失主家里。在一个下雨的夜晚，一位女乘客拿着买来的东西，匆匆跳下三轮车回到家里。她发觉随身带着的黑色手提皮包找不到了，皮包里有二万多元银行存款单据，还有现款、图章、钢笔等物品。她记不清皮包遗失在哪里，烦恼地在家里找寻，无心吃晚饭。这时，在自己车上拾到这个皮包的三轮车工人严义才也无心吃晚饭，他放弃了生意，冒着大雨赶了五里路，把皮包带到自己住宅附近的居民委员会去。他和居民委员会干部一道在失物中反复找寻，才从皮包中的一个信封上找到了失主的姓名和地址。当失主赵慧珍到三轮车管理所去领取皮包时，把一些酬劳品送给严义才留作纪念，严义才再三不肯收。
    严义才曾经多次把钢笔、雨衣、钥匙等物亲自送还失主，因此他最近得到了上海市三轮车管理机关给予的特等奖。
    上海各个公共场所里已经看不到“谨防扒手”的牌子，代替它的是失主送来的许多表扬拾金不昧的信件和锦旗。
