Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 16th - The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a plenary (enlarged) meeting. In accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, democracy was fully promoted to inspect and criticize the shortcomings of subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism in the Party's leadership work.

This enlarged meeting was held from October 25th to November 11th. More than 800 people attended the meeting, including Party cadres at the district level and above from various prefectures, counties (cities) in agricultural and pastoral areas, the Qaidam region, and provincial departments.

This meeting first spent more than half of its time repeatedly studying the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and, in connection with their own ideological situation and the actual situation of their work, carried out in-depth and meticulous inspections in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, summarizing the achievements, experiences, and existing problems in their work.

More than 100 people spoke at the meeting, affirming the achievements of their work while particularly criticizing the shortcomings. They pointed out that the main problem in the Party's work in Qinghai Province is that the ideological level of leadership lags behind the changes in real life. For example, since the winter of last year, resource exploration work for oil, coal, iron, etc., centered on the Qaidam Basin, has been carried out throughout the province. This work is large-scale and developing rapidly, but Qinghai Province's various forces are insufficient, and the foundation is very weak. The leadership's ideological understanding of this new situation and new circumstances is insufficient, and they have not been able to make timely and appropriate arrangements, resulting in a state of being busy, chaotic, and passive in terms of material supply and transportation. In terms of rural work, since the realization of agricultural cooperation, many new problems have emerged in rural areas, such as the relationship between cooperatives and members, the relationship between cooperatives and the state, as well as issues in production, supply, and sales, which have not been dealt with in a timely manner. In addition, because the leading organs are busy with paperwork, there is little systematic investigation and research into the specific situation in actual work. As a result, problems in the work cannot be solved in a timely manner, and the key tasks and overall work have not been well arranged, often resulting in a situation of being overwhelmed and unable to cope.

The meeting also examined the shortcomings existing in Qinghai Province in the relations between cadres of Party organizations at all levels, between Party cadres and non-Party cadres, between various departments, and between people of all ethnic groups. The meeting believes that the implementation of the collective leadership system at all levels of leading organs, the full promotion of democracy, and the exertion of the initiative of various Party committee members are insufficient; there are shortcomings in the handling of comrades who have made mistakes; there are still problems in the mutual cooperation between some units, and some comrades often overemphasize the importance and difficulty of their own work, without considering the overall situation enough; some cadres still have more or less pride, complacency, and liberalism, which also affects unity. At the same time, Han Chinese Party cadres still have remnants of Han chauvinism in their dealings with ethnic minority cadres, and they are not patient enough to cultivate and help ethnic minority cadres; there are also shortcomings in Party cadres' respect for the powers and functions of non-Party democratic personages and in their specific assistance to them.

After examining and analyzing the above situation, in order to successfully complete the more arduous tasks facing the Party organizations in Qinghai Province, such as large-scale resource exploration, the construction of large-scale industry, and the socialist transformation of animal husbandry, the meeting adopted a resolution on "further strengthening unity, fully promoting democracy, closely connecting with the masses, and going deep into practical work," and made specific arrangements for the work in 1957.

This meeting also invited some non-Party democratic personages to attend as observers.

    中共青海省委召开扩大会议
    根据“八大”精神检查领导工作
    会议指出主要问题是党的领导思想水平落后于现实生活的变化
    新华社西宁16日电　中共青海省委员会最近举行全体会议（扩大），根据中共第八次全国代表大会决议的精神，充分发扬民主，检查和批判了党的领导工作上的主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的缺点。
    这次扩大会议是从10月25日到11月11日举行的。参加会议的有八百多人，他们是来自农业区和牧业区各州、县（市）、柴达木地区以及省级各部门的区级以上的党员干部。
    这次会议首先用了一半以上的时间，反复地学习中共第八次全国代表大会的文件，并且联系自己的思想情况和本单位工作的实际情况，以批评和自我批评的精神，进行深入细致的检查，总结出工作中的成绩、经验和存在的问题。
    有一百多人在会上发言，他们肯定了工作的成绩，同时特别批评了缺点。他们指出，青海省党的工作中的主要问题是领导思想水平落后于现实生活的变化。如从去年冬季以来，在全省范围内进行了以柴达木盆地为中心的石油、煤、铁等资源勘探工作，这些工作规模宏大而且发展迅速，而青海省的各种力量不足，基础十分薄弱，领导思想上对这一新的形势和新的情况认识不足，没有能够及时地加以妥善的安排，以致在物资供应和交通运输等方面处于忙乱和被动状态。在农村工作方面，自从实现了农业合作化以后，农村中出现了许多新的问题，如社与社员之间、社与国家之间的关系，以及产、供、销等方面的问题，没有能够得到及时的处理。另外，由于领导机关忙于文牍事务，对实际工作中的具体情况系统地调查研究少，因而工作中存在的问题不能及时加以解决，对于重点工作和全盘工作也就未能很好地加以安排，往往顾此失彼，处于招架应付的局面。
    会议还检查了青海省在各级党组织的干部之间、党员干部和非党干部之间、各部门之间、各族人民之间的关系等方面存在的缺点。会议认为，各级领导机关切实贯彻执行集体领导制度、充分发扬民主和发挥各个党委委员的积极性是不够的；对犯有错误的同志的处理有缺点；在一些单位之间的相互协作上还存在有问题，有的同志往往过分强调自己工作的重要和困难，对于整体考虑得不够；有些干部还或多或少地存在着骄傲自满情绪和自由主义，因此也影响着团结。同时，汉族党员干部在和少数民族干部相处中，仍然残存着大汉族主义，对少数民族干部不能耐心地加以培养和帮助；党员干部尊重党外民主人士的职权和对他们的具体帮助也还有缺点。
    会议在检查和分析了以上情况以后，为了很好地完成摆在青海省党组织面前的更大规模的资源勘探、大型工业的建设和牧业的社会主义改造等艰巨任务，通过了一项“进一步增强团结、充分发扬民主、密切联系群众、深入实际工作”的决议，并且对1957年的工作做了具体安排。
    这次会议还邀请了一部分党外民主人士列席。
