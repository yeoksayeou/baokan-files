    周恩来总理访问越中友好协会
    新华社河内19日电　周恩来总理今天下午六点半在范文同总理和中国驻越南大使罗贵波陪同下，到越中友好协会进行访问。在那里，他受到越中友好协会会长裴纪和副会长阮春水、陈辉燎的热情招待。
    裴纪老人指着挂在大厅里的毛泽东主席和胡志明主席握手的巨幅绣像说，这是越中两国人民友谊的象征，愿越中两国人民像他们的领袖一样永远站在一起。
    周恩来总理说，他很高兴能有机会到越中友好协会进行访问，他同意裴纪会长所说的话。他说，让我们大家，让我们的后代，就像胡志明主席和毛泽东主席紧握着手一样，永远并肩前进——向着社会主义和共产主义前进！
    在周恩来告辞之前，裴纪会长代表越中友好协会把一套银制茶具赠给周总理留念。周恩来笑着说，好，我代表中国人民接受这个友谊的礼品。
    周恩来总理还为越中友好协会题字留念。
