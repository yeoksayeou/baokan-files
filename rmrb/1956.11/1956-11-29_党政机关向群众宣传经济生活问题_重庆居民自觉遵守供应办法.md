Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 28th: Chongqing's leading organs are actively conducting propaganda and education work among the people regarding issues of the people's economic life.

    Responsible persons from the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee gave reports at cadre meetings on "How to Understand the Problem of Supply Falling Short of Demand for Certain Commodities," analyzed the reasons for the supply of some commodities not meeting demand, and emphasized that Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and personnel in government organs should strictly abide by state supply measures, practice strict economy, maintain a diligent and thrifty work style, and set an example among the people.

    Most of the city's organs, schools, factories, and mines have also conducted education work in this regard for their employees, students, and residents. After listening to the reports, a large number of activists from more than thirty street offices in the city center held symposiums in residential areas to publicize and explain the situation. After understanding the reasons for the supply of meat, vegetable oil, and other commodities falling short of demand, many residents consciously abide by supply measures. In Jiulongpo District in the suburbs of the city, 40% of residents and farmers have heard these reports. Some members of agricultural cooperatives have proposed increasing the raising of fattened pigs, appropriately reducing the amount of pork used for personal consumption during the New Year and other festivals, and increasing the supply to the city as much as possible.

    Commercial, local industrial, and handicraft departments are also actively taking measures to improve the production and supply of various materials, and are conducting education among cadres and employees in their systems on caring about the people's economic life and establishing a concept of serving consumers.
