Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: The Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court on the 17th tried the case of Li Zhuoru, a state organ cadre, who exceeded his authority and infringed upon citizens' rights. The verdict was that Li Zhuoru was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, suspended for one year.

The defendant, Li Zhuoru, is currently the director of the office of the Guangzhou City Sports Commission and formerly served concurrently as the director of the preparatory office for the Ershaotou construction site of the Guangzhou City Sports Commission. On the afternoon of January 25th of this year, Li Yuqiong, the general affairs clerk of the office, lost 20.08 yuan in meal expenses and 10 jin of food stamps. After Li Zhuoru learned about this, he neither reported the case to the public security organs nor listened to the dissuasion of staff members Liang Guangde and Liao Hezhen, and illegally and arbitrarily decided to conduct a personal and residential search of Yi Xuxu, his reason being that Yi Xuxu was present when the money was counted by Li Yuqiong, the person who lost the money. After 23.67 yuan was found on Yi Xuxu, Li Zhuoru concluded that Yi Xuxu was the thief. He had a private conversation with Yi Xuxu, asking her to make a self-criticism at the general cadre meeting the next day. At the meeting, some people suspected that the items stolen in the past were also stolen by Yi Xuxu, which led to the meeting developing into a pursuit and struggle against Yi Xuxu. Yi Xuxu was forced to admit that she had committed theft in the past. At the end of the meeting, based on someone's proposal, Li Zhuoru decided to give Yi Xuxu two days to reflect and restricted Yi Xuxu's freedom of movement. After the meeting, Li Zhuoru also said to another staff member, Wang Zhen: "In the future, any letters Yi Xuxu receives or visitors she has must go through the organization." Finally, when Li Zhuoru saw a suicide note Yi Xuxu sent to her lover, he unreasonably accused Yi Xuxu of "trying to threaten the organization with suicide" and had another private conversation with her, criticizing her. On the morning of January 27th, Yi Xuxu finally committed suicide.

When the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court heard the case, it held that after the defendant, Li Zhuoru, discovered the embezzlement of public funds, he did not report it to the public security and procuratorial organs, but exceeded his authority and illegally made a series of decisions, such as searching his staff, detaining letters, and restricting personal freedom, infringing upon the rights of citizens granted by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. When someone spoke at the meeting to pursue and struggle against Yi Xuxu, Li Zhuoru did not correct it. All these illegal and erroneous acts led to Yi Xuxu's suicide, causing serious consequences. The defendant Li Zhuoru's behavior constituted a crime of negligence. However, since the defendant was able to confess his guilt and show sincere repentance, the court decided to give Li Zhuoru a lighter sentence of one year of imprisonment, suspended for one year.

On the 18th, the Guangzhou Daily published a commentary on the matter, criticizing the erroneous view that some people believed that Li Zhuoru had always been active in his work and had no bad motives in dealing with Yi Xuxu, so he could be exempted from legal punishment. The newspaper believes that the dignity of the constitution cannot be arbitrarily destroyed. The commentary emphasized that state personnel should learn from Li Zhuoru's illegal incident, strengthen their awareness of the legal system, and eliminate illegal phenomena.

    公民权利不容侵犯
    广州市体委干部李卓儒侵犯人身自由受到法律制裁
    新华社广州讯　广州市中级人民法院17日审判国家机关干部李卓儒逾越职权侵犯公民权利案。审判结果，判处李卓儒有期徒刑一年，缓刑一年执行。
    被告李卓儒现任广州市体育运动委员会办公室主任，曾经兼任广州市体育运动委员会二少头工地筹建办公室主任。今年1月25日下午，办公室总务黎玉琼丢了膳费二十元零八角和粮票十斤。李卓儒知道这件事后，既没有向公安机关报案，又不听工作人员梁广德和廖和珍的劝阻，非法擅自决定对易煦煦进行人身和住宅搜查，他的理由是丢款人黎玉琼点款时易煦煦曾在场。从易煦煦身上搜出二十三元六角七分后，李卓儒便认定易煦煦是偷钱的人，找易煦煦个别谈话，要易煦煦在第二天的全体干部大会上检讨。会上，有些人怀疑以前失窃的东西也是易煦煦偷的，以致会议发展成对易煦煦追逼、斗争。易煦煦被迫承认以前有偷窃行为。会末，李卓儒根据有人提议，决定给易煦煦两天的时间进行反省，并限制易煦煦的行动自由。会后，李卓儒还对另一工作人员王真说：“以后易煦煦有信件或有人来访要通过组织。”最后，李卓儒看到易煦煦寄给她的爱人的一封表示要自杀的绝笔信的时候，还无理地指责易煦煦是“想用自杀来威胁组织”，并且又同她作个别谈话，对她提出批评。1月27日早晨，易煦煦终于自杀身死。
    广州市中级人民法院在审理这个案件时，认为被告李卓儒发现公款失窃以后不向公安、检察机关报告，竟逾越职权非法作出对所属工作人员进行搜查、扣查信件、限制人身自由等一系列的决定，侵犯了中华人民共和国宪法所赋予公民的权利；在大会上有人发言向易煦煦进行追逼、斗争的时候，李卓儒又没有加以纠正。所有这些违法和错误行为，促使易煦煦自杀死亡，造成严重的恶果。被告李卓儒这种行为，已经构成过失犯罪。但由于被告尚能坦白认罪，有真诚悔改的表现，法院决定从轻判处李卓儒徒刑一年，缓刑一年执行。
    18日，广州日报曾就此事发表了评论，批评有些人认为李卓儒工作一贯积极，处理易煦煦事又并无不良动机，因此可以免予法律处分的错误看法。报纸认为，宪法的尊严是不能够随意破坏的。评论强调说，国家工作人员应从李卓儒违法事件中吸取教训，加强法制观念，消灭违法现象。
