Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th - The Yangchun County People's Committee in Guangdong Province recently held a plenary meeting and, based on the suggestions put forward by the Yangchun County People's Procuratorate, made a resolution to correct the error of failing to convene county People's Congress meetings and People's Committee meetings according to legal timeframes for a long period in the past. In addition to guaranteeing the implementation of the resolution, the County People's Committee also organized inspection teams to urge People's Committees at the township level to convene township People's Congress meetings on time.

The first meeting of the First Yangchun County People's Congress was held in June 1954, and the second meeting was not held until January of this year. The County People's Committee also only held three meetings from January to September this year. This violates the provisions of the "Organizational Law of Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees at All Levels of the People's Republic of China," which stipulates that county People's Congress meetings should be held twice a year, and county People's Committee meetings should be held once a month. The Yangchun County People's Procuratorate believes that the main reason for this situation is that the leading cadres of the County People's Committee have a weak sense of the legal system and often use the excuse of being busy with central work, incorrectly replacing the County People's Congress meetings and People's Committee meetings with cadre expansion meetings. This prevents the people's organs of power from properly exercising their functions and powers.

The situation discovered by the Yangchun County People's Procuratorate has attracted the attention of the Guangdong Provincial People's Procuratorate. The Provincial People's Procuratorate then conducted a preliminary inspection of the situation throughout the province and submitted a petition to the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, requesting that it order the People's Committees at all levels under its jurisdiction to conduct inspections so that the relevant cadres can receive legal education and ensure that the legal provisions for holding local People's Congress meetings and local People's Committee meetings on schedule are effectively implemented in the future.

    接受县人民检察院加强法制观念的建议，
    阳春县保证按时召开人民代表大会会议
    新华社广州8日电　广东省阳春县人民委员会最近召开全体会议，根据阳春县人民检察院提出的建议，作出了纠正过去长期不遵守法律规定时间召开县人民代表大会会议和人民委员会会议的错误的决议。县人民委员会除了保证决议的执行以外，并组织视察组，督促各乡人民委员会按时召开乡人民代表大会会议。
    阳春县第一届人民代表大会第一次会议是1954年6月召开的，直到今年1月才召开第二次会议；县人民委员会从今年1月到9月份也只开过三次会议。这就违反了中华人民共和国地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法中，关于县人民代表大会会议每年举行二次，县人民委员会会议每月举行一次的规定。阳春县人民检察院认为，造成这种情况的主要原因，是县人民委员会领导人员法制观念不强，往往借口中心工作忙，不正确地以干部扩大会议代替县人民代表大会会议和人民委员会会议。这就使得人民权力机关不能正常行使职权。
    阳春县人民检察院所发现的情况，已引起广东省人民检察院的重视。省人民检察院随即对全省情况进行初步检察，并向广东省人民委员会提出提请书，要求责成所属各级人民委员会进行检查，使有关干部得到一次法制教育，保证今后切实执行按期举行地方各级人民代表大会会议和地方各级人民委员会会议的法律规定。
