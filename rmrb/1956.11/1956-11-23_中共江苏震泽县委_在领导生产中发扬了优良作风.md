Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd: Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province, achieved an average yield of 902 jin per mu for over 140,000 mu of grain crops (double cropping of rice and wheat), ahead of schedule in realizing the increased production target set in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) to be achieved by 1957. The county's more than 14,000 mu of fruits such as Yangmei (Chinese bayberry), plums, loquats, and oranges also saw increased production compared to previous years. Among them, the famous "Dongting Red" oranges increased by more than 50% compared to last year.

Zhenze County is located in the center and on the shores of Taihu Lake. Farmers grow fruit trees near the mountains and grain crops near the water. This year, the county was hit by three typhoons and four rainstorms in succession, and also experienced insect pests and diseases such as rice stem borers. However, thanks to the realization of agricultural cooperativization throughout the county, a bumper harvest was still achieved this year. Last winter and this spring, in the upsurge of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the county's farmers built over one million cubic meters of farmland water conservancy projects, equivalent to the total of all previous years since liberation. The natural fertilizers accumulated by agricultural cooperatives are piled up everywhere like small mountains. The amount of fertilizer applied to many farmlands has never been as much as this year. In the past, a lot of grain was lost due to stem borer damage.

The Zhenze County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has a relatively thorough work style in leading agricultural production. The implementation of each increase production technical measure generally goes through mobilizing the masses, setting examples, training farmer technicians, etc., so it is not easy to go out of shape when implemented. Some leading cadres often go to agricultural cooperatives to investigate and research, and help solve problems as soon as they encounter them. For example, in the spring, wheat turned yellow, and in the autumn, rice turned yellow. There were different opinions, and no one knew the reason. After the leading cadres of the Zhenze County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party went to the countryside for investigation, they found that the wheat turned yellow due to drought, and the rice turned yellow due to disease. In both cases, farmers were immediately mobilized to prescribe the right medicine, so that wheat seedlings and rice universally revived and turned green. When lower-level cadres report situations and problems to their superiors, the county committee does not rush to draw conclusions, but repeatedly investigates and verifies to avoid the phenomenon of exaggeration. This has greatly reduced the losses caused by subjectivism and bureaucratism in the work.

Although Zhenze County has increased production this year, the production costs of many agricultural cooperatives are higher than in previous years; there has also been waste in the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the struggle against wind disasters and insect pests.

### 中共江苏震泽县委  在领导生产中发扬了优良作风

    中共江苏震泽县委
    在领导生产中发扬了优良作风
    据新华社南京22日电　江苏省震泽县今年十四万多亩粮食作物（稻、麦连作）平均每亩产九百零二斤，提前实现了全国农业发展纲要（草案）中规定到1957年实现的增产指标。全县一万四千多亩杨梅、梅子、枇杷、桔子等水果，也都比往年增产。其中著名的“洞庭红”桔子比去年增产五成以上。
    震泽县地处太湖中心和湖滨。农民傍山种植果树，傍水种植粮食作物。今年这个县先后受到三次台风、四次暴雨的袭击，还发生过水稻螟虫等虫、病害。但是，由于全县实现了农业合作化，今年仍然丰收。去冬今春，全县农民在合作化运动高潮中曾经兴修了一百多万土方的农田水利工程，等于解放以来历年的总和。农业社积聚的自然肥料，到处堆得像小山一样。很多农田的施肥量从来没有像今年这样多。往年因螟虫为害而损失很多粮食。
    中共震泽县委员会在领导农业生产方面，作风比较深入。每一项增产技术措施的推行，一般都经过发动群众，做出样子，训练农民技术员等等，因此贯彻实行起来不容易走样子。有些领导干部经常到农业社调查研究，一遇到问题就帮助解决。例如春季小麦发黄，秋季水稻发黄，众口纷纭，不知原因何在。经过中共震泽县委领导干部先后下乡调查以后，发现麦子是受旱发黄，稻子是患病发黄。两次都立即发动农民对症下药，使麦苗、稻子普遍复活转青。下面干部向上汇报情况和问题的时候，县委并不忙着下结论，而是反复地调查核对，避免发生虚夸的现象。这样就大大地减少了工作中因主观主义和官僚主义而引起的损失。
    震泽县今年虽然增产了，但是不少农业社生产成本比往年高；在同风灾、虫害作斗争中施用化学肥料和农药的时候，也有浪费现象。
