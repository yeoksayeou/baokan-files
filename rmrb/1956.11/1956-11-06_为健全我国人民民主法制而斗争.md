Struggle to Strengthen Our Country's People's Democratic Legal System
Li Qi

(I)

The Eighth National Congress of the Party paid great attention to the issue of strengthening our country's people's democratic legal system. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the political report of the Central Committee of the Party: "One of our pressing tasks in the current state work is to begin systematically formulating relatively complete laws and improving our country's legal system." Comrade Dong Biwu made a special speech at the conference on strengthening the Party's leadership over legal work, put forward many necessary measures to improve the legal system, and severely criticized the erroneous tendency to neglect the legal system. Finally, the resolution of the conference on the political report stipulated that our country's people's democratic legal system must be further strengthened, and emphasized: "All state organs and state personnel must strictly abide by the state laws, so that the people's democratic rights are fully protected by the state." The instructions of the Eighth National Congress of the Party on strengthening our country's legal system and the tasks put forward for legislative work are completely in line with the needs of our country's socialist construction and the aspirations of the people of the whole country, and also provide great support and encouragement to our country's legal workers and judicial workers.

(II)

Our country's people's democratic legal system is the most revolutionary and progressive socialist type of legal system in the world. It has developed in the democratic revolution and socialist revolution led by the working class in our country. It is a powerful weapon for safeguarding the achievements of the revolution, guaranteeing the democratic rights of citizens, and exercising dictatorship over enemies at home and abroad.

In the various periods of the domestic revolutionary war, with the establishment and development of various revolutionary base areas, the people's revolutionary government formulated many necessary laws and decrees and established a revolutionary legal system. This played a great role in consolidating the order of the revolutionary base areas, supporting the struggle of the masses, and winning the victory of the war. Because the task of the revolutionary struggle at this time was to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in China, to liberate the entire nation and liberate social productive forces, and the main method of revolutionary struggle was to mobilize the masses and carry out armed struggle to defeat powerful enemies at home and abroad, it was impossible to formulate relatively complete laws and establish a sound legal system at this time.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, national unification was achieved, all laws, decrees, and judicial systems of the Kuomintang reactionary government that oppressed the people were abolished, and the "Common Program" and other laws and decrees protecting the people were formulated as a temporary constitution. A people's judicial system and revolutionary legal system were established throughout the country. However, at this time, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces continued to weigh on the people's heads, and it was necessary to continue to mobilize the masses and let them act directly to thoroughly eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, complete the historical tasks of the democratic revolution that had not yet been completed, and create good conditions for the socialist revolution and socialist construction. This situation of struggle made it impossible to establish a sound legal system in a period after the founding of New China. The laws and decrees promulgated by the state were mostly temporary and programmatic, rather than complete laws. This was completely necessary and appropriate at the time.

The situation is different now. Today, we have not only completed the various social reforms of the democratic revolution, basically eliminated the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, convened the First National People's Congress, and formulated the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, but we have also basically completed the historical tasks of socialist transformation stipulated in the Constitution and achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. In order to consolidate the order of socialist construction, complete laws and a legal system are needed. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his political report: "Now that the period of revolutionary storms has passed, new relations of production have been established, and the task of struggle has become protecting the smooth development of social productive forces, the methods of struggle must also change accordingly, and a complete legal system is absolutely necessary."

(III)

Some comrades believe that we did not have a complete legal system in the past, but relied on the Party's policies, and didn't we do a good job? Haven't we achieved great victories? Therefore, they believe that formulating complete laws and improving the country's legal system is not an urgent task.

This view is incorrect. It is a right-leaning conservative ideology that is satisfied with the achievements and experiences of the past, thereby causing understanding to lag behind actual development. Let's first take the struggle against counter-revolutionaries. After the two large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaigns that began in 1950 and the second half of 1955, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have indeed been greatly weakened, and it has become increasingly difficult for them to carry out sabotage activities. However, because they generally wear disguises and carry out concealed activities within the people, we cannot deal with exposed or relatively exposed counter-revolutionaries as easily as in the past. The logic is very simple: the difference between a wolf and a sheep is very clear, but if a wolf in sheep's clothing sneaks into a flock of sheep, it is not so easy to identify. In this situation, if we don't do well, it is very likely that we will harm our own people and let go of the real enemies. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign that began in the second half of 1955, especially the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in government organs, was not as easy to do as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign in 1950 because it mainly involved fighting against hidden enemies. To ensure that public security organs, procuratorial organs, and judicial organs can better and accurately strike at various counter-revolutionaries, it is not enough to have only correct policies and lines for suppressing counter-revolutionaries. We must also have a complete legal system. That is to say, we must earnestly implement the system of division of responsibilities and mutual restraint among public security organs, procuratorial organs, and judicial organs in terms of the legal system, so that investigation, prosecution, trial, and labor reform work are strictly carried out in accordance with legal procedures and regulations. It is necessary to improve the trial system and the lawyer system, and fully protect the defendant's litigation rights and defense rights. To achieve this step, it is necessary not only to further comprehensively implement the Organic Law of the People's Courts, the Organic Law of the People's Procuratorates, and the Regulations on Labor Reform, but also to have a complete criminal law and criminal procedure law, as well as other relevant laws. Only in this way is it possible to eliminate all counter-revolutionaries without wrongly accusing a single good person.

Secondly, today, because "the task of struggle has become protecting the smooth development of social productive forces," the focus of the revolutionary legal system is no longer just on fighting against counter-revolutionaries, but must also strengthen the struggle against all other criminals who endanger social management order and citizens' rights. It is obviously inappropriate to only emphasize the struggle against counter-revolutionaries while neglecting or relaxing the struggle against other criminals. As for those who attribute all kinds of criminal offenses to counter-revolutionary acts, or punish them according to the Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, that is even more inappropriate. Because this will not only expand the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, but will also inevitably lead to improper sentencing in some non-counter-revolutionary cases, that is, the crime and the punishment are not commensurate. The interests of the state should be fully protected, and the struggle against all criminal acts that endanger the interests of the state is the glorious and sacred duty of our public security organs, procuratorial organs, and judicial organs. At the same time, the rights of citizens should also be fully protected, and the struggle against all criminal acts that endanger the rights of citizens is also the glorious and sacred duty of our public security organs, procuratorial organs, and judicial organs. It is obviously incorrect to juxtapose the two and emphasize the public while neglecting the private, or to adopt an indifferent attitude towards infringements of citizens' rights. This does not meet the Party's requirement of "fully protecting the people's democratic rights by the state." One of the fundamental differences between our country's people's democratic legal system and the legal system of capitalist countries lies in the fact that the rights of every citizen are fully protected by the state, and the state is responsible for investigating all criminal acts, regardless of whether they infringe on the interests of the state or the rights of citizens, and will never allow criminals who should be punished by law – no matter how high their social status – to go unpunished. Especially because of the victory of socialist transformation, criminal cases have been greatly reduced, and civil cases have relatively increased (according to statistics from fourteen provinces and cities including Hebei and Beijing in April 1956, civil cases accepted by the people's courts have accounted for 62.9% of the total number of cases received). In order to fully protect the rights of citizens, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people in building socialism, establish a normal social life and social production order, adjust social relations, and promote the development of production and material and cultural life, it is necessary to have relatively complete laws, including criminal law, civil law, procedural law, and other basic laws. Without these complete laws, it is very difficult to educate the people, prevent crimes, consolidate and develop the socialist economic base, and thoroughly correct certain chaotic and unreasonable phenomena existing in judicial work. Therefore, the Eighth National Congress of the Party proposed formulating relatively complete laws and improving our country's legal system, which is completely in line with our struggle needs.

Of course, it is also wrong to regard the law as omnipotent, believing that with complete laws, all problems can be easily solved, and therefore one can sit back and relax, eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, and prevent any wrongful convictions from happening again. However, the problem today is not here, but that our laws are not yet complete, and that, as pointed out in the resolution of the Eighth National Congress of the Party on the political report, it is necessary to "gradually and systematically formulate complete laws."

Some comrades believe that "with a complete legal system, our hands and feet will be bound, which will be detrimental to our work." This view is also wrong.

The basic principle of our country's people's democratic legal system is that the activities of state organs must be based on the law, and cannot exceed the limits prescribed by law. All state organ personnel and citizens must abide by the law, and all illegal acts must be stopped. Therefore, improving the legal system, in a certain sense, is precisely to bind people's hands and feet, but it does not bind people's hands and feet from fighting against enemies at home and abroad, nor does it bind people's hands and feet from seeking benefits and happiness for the country, the people, and humanity. Instead, it binds the hands and feet of those counter-revolutionaries and all criminals from carrying out criminal activities, and it binds the hands and feet of those in state organs who abuse their power, act arbitrarily, engage in malpractice for personal gain, embezzle and accept bribes, and infringe on the interests of the state and the rights of citizens, so that they can be law-abiding, work diligently, and not violate laws and regulations. What's wrong with this for work? What's wrong with this for the country and the people? There are only benefits and no harm. Under our country's people's democratic system, the more complete the laws and the sounder the legal system, the more fully the interests of the state and the rights of citizens can be protected, the more quickly our people can get rid of certain feudal and capitalist ideas and bad habits that still affect people's actions and lives today, and the fewer counter-revolutionaries and all criminals there will be. If they dare to carry out criminal activities, they will be more easily exposed. Because the law stipulates what kind of behavior is a crime, what kind of behavior is not a crime, what is prohibited by law, and what is protected by law, this can not only encourage the people to avoid evil and do good, but also encourage the people to fight against criminals and implement mass supervision, thereby preventing crime and reducing crime.

Today, the tendency to disregard the legal system that exists among some of our Party members and state personnel is most prominently manifested in their failure to attach importance to or abide by state laws, their contempt for and obliteration of the rights of the people, their view of themselves as special figures perched above the people, and even their abuse of power, arbitrary actions, infringement of citizens' personal and property rights, which demonstrates a feudal and capitalist privileged mentality. The basic characteristic of this ideology is a lack of respect for the rights of the people and a lack of a concept of equality before the law. It is not surprising that this kind of thinking still exists in our Party. Old China was a country without democracy. The privileged mentality formed by long-term feudal rule in terms of ideology cannot be eliminated in a short period of time. The existence of this kind of thinking cannot but be reflected in our Party. Our Party has already done a great deal of work to eliminate these feudal and capitalist ideas inside and outside the Party in the past, and will continue to do so vigorously in the future. I believe that in order to improve our country's legal system, fully protect the rights of citizens, and oppose this privileged mentality and various illegal acts arising therefrom, it is very important.

The idea of disregarding the legal system also has another source in some people, which is the influence of the traditional Chinese idea of ​​disregarding the rule of law and jurisprudence.

Lao Tzu once said, "The more laws and decrees there are, the more thieves there will be." Confucianism even advocated the rule of ritual and despised the rule of law. The great historian Sima Qian, in the preface to the "Biographies of Cruel Officials" in "Historical Records," severely criticized the harm of the Qin Dynasty's overly strict legal net and praised the benefits of the Han Dynasty's "net leaking fish that can swallow boats." For thousands of years, people have been greatly influenced by this Confucian and Taoist thought of disregarding the rule of law. This is an important reason why jurisprudence has not flourished in China for a long time. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Shen Jiaben wrote this about the jurisprudence of the Ming and Qing dynasties in "On the Rise and Fall of Jurisprudence": In the Ming Dynasty, "the books on jurisprudence that the world knows about are only dozens of families, or they are passed down or not passed down, because no one attaches importance to them. In this dynasty, those who study jurisprudence and are respected by the world are no more than a few people. The country has no special subject, and everyone despises it. Ji Wenda compiled the 'Siku Quanshu' ['Complete Library of the Four Treasuries'], and the 'Political Books Category' only included two parts, and the 'Catalogue' only included five parts. The annotation said: 'Punishment cannot be abolished in a prosperous age, but it is also not respected in a prosperous age. The records only preserve the outline and do not seek completeness.' The Siku Catalogue is a book written by command, and the trend of the world belongs to it. Now that this theory is created above, the people below follow the trend, and this is why jurisprudence is declining day by day." In fact, Ji Yun's thinking of despising jurisprudence was still dominated by the traditional Chinese Confucian and Taoist thought, and it was not his "original theory." After the Republic of China, warlords fought each other, and guns came first. There was no way to talk about the legal system. People who studied law mostly regarded it as a stepping stone to promotion and fortune, so jurisprudence was even less valued by the world. Today, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has many research institutes, but there is no jurisprudence research institute. There are many courses on Marxism-Leninism in Party schools, but there are no courses on Marxist-Leninist jurisprudence. Many people are willing to do other scientific research work, but are unwilling to do jurisprudence research work. Phenomena such as this, which despise jurisprudence, naturally have other various subjective and objective reasons, and there are various difficulties in solving problems. But I think that this traditional Chinese thought of despising the rule of law and jurisprudence still plays a role in the thinking of some people, and it cannot but be a factor.

In summary, to improve our country's legal system, ideologically, we must fight against the right-leaning conservative thinking that is satisfied with the achievements and experiences of past work, we must fight against feudal and capitalist ideas, and we must fight against the traditional Chinese ideas of despising the rule of law and jurisprudence. All of this can be boiled down to one point: opposing the bourgeois legal thought that is divorced from the masses of the people. This is the main task on the ideological front of political and legal affairs in implementing the instructions of the Eighth National Congress of the Party on the political report regarding the improvement of our country's legal system.

(IV)

In order to improve our country's legal system, I think we should start from the following four aspects.

1. Strengthen legislative work. Comrade Dong Biwu has already given specific instructions on this in his speech at the "Eighth National Congress" meeting, so I will not say more here. I just want to say one sentence, that is, I deeply hope that the criminal law and the criminal procedure law can be formulated as soon as possible. At the same time, the drafting of the civil law and the civil procedure law should be actively carried out.

2. Further improve the judicial organs and the judicial system. Here, improving the people's procuratorial organs and the lawyer system is of great significance. The procuratorial organs have the responsibility of supreme legal supervision. Fully and effectively fulfilling their responsibilities will undoubtedly greatly improve our country's judicial system. The view of underestimating the role of the procuratorial organs and believing that the procuratorial organs are dispensable is completely wrong. Secondly, lawyers are the legal advisors of the people. Through the lawyers' defense, they can not only effectively help the defendants in litigation, but also effectively help the judicial organs to correctly handle cases. This has been well proven by the fact that all places where lawyer associations or legal advisory offices have been established and lawyers have been able to seriously fulfill their responsibilities have been warmly supported by the people.

3. Strengthen legal education and oppose all illegal and criminal acts. In this regard, opposing illegal and criminal acts among state personnel is of even greater significance. Here, I would like to start with a specific illegal event. On August 17, 1956, the Guangming Daily published "A Strange Letter Found in the Files." In this short article, the author revealed the following fact: Zhang Xianmin, a member of the Handan Prefectural Committee of Hebei Province, wanted to divorce his wife Han Qiaofeng from his hometown of Feixiang (Feixiang is a county under the leadership of the Handan Prefectural Committee), but without going through any legal procedures, he only sent a secret letter to the Feixiang County People's Court, and the court declared a divorce verdict – even though the defendant Han Qiaofeng firmly refused to divorce. This secret letter was written as follows:

"…I am preparing to divorce, please help me. My opinion is that after you receive the letter, do not tell anyone, and you personally handle it for me. There are relatives near the city, and it will cause me difficulties if I say it, and it will also add some trouble to you, right? When necessary, you must take 'decisive' and 'rapid' measures, and do not delay for a long time. My opinion is that you should go to my house in Dongying Village the night before to persuade her to divorce. The next day, you should do the formalities and send them to me..."

After the recipient of the Feixiang County People's Court received this urgent secret letter, he quickly went to Zhang Xianmin's home in Dongying Village, found Han Qiaofeng, and persuaded her to divorce. Han firmly disagreed, and the recipient "quickly" and "decisively" ruled for a divorce in December 1955. The child was temporarily raised by the woman, and the man paid ten yuan per month, which was later changed to thirty yuan.

Some comrades did not pay attention after reading the above news and felt that this was a "small matter" and didn't matter. Is it still a "small matter" that Zhang Xianmin abused his authority and the judge perverted the law for personal gain? The national law allows divorce, so why not formally file a lawsuit? Why not follow the legal procedures? Is it because we are Party and state cadres that we can become "special figures" perched above the people and not abide by the national law? And can the court make an illegal verdict? Clearly, in this situation, it is impossible to fully protect the rights of citizens. I believe that to improve our country's legal system and establish our country's strict rule of law spirit, we must start by earnestly exposing and handling these "small matters" and publicizing them widely, so that Party members and state personnel can clearly understand that even these "small matters" are not allowed by the state.

4. Strengthen legal science work. This is a big issue. Here, I would like to put forward only the following points of view. (1) We should be determined to establish the Institute of Jurisprudence. Delaying it for too long will be detrimental to our work. If the cadres cannot be fully equipped at once, we can first establish some groups and start work. (2) We must adhere to the principle of studying Marxist-Leninist jurisprudence from China's reality and Chairman Mao's instruction on "being good at learning." In the past seven years since liberation, generally speaking, the Party Central Committee's correct policy has been implemented in the field of jurisprudence. But it cannot be denied that in some people there is still a dogmatic tendency to mechanically apply foreign experience without considering China's actual situation or analyzing it. Today, China's jurisprudence is still in its infancy and has not yet embarked on its original stage. This requires the efforts of jurists across the country. At the same time, the state's early formulation of various basic codes will vigorously promote the formation and development of Chinese jurisprudence schools. After seven years of efforts, our country today has a vigorous new young team on the jurisprudence front. Its weaknesses are that its combat effectiveness is not strong enough, its knowledge preparation is not sufficient, and it still has a dogmatic tendency in some aspects. The way to overcome this is to "be good at learning." The "learning, and more learning" that Comrade Mao Zedong instructed in his opening speech at the Eighth National Congress of the Party is of special significance to our country's jurisprudence workers. (3) We must mobilize all positive factors and implement the Party's "letting a hundred flowers bloom" policy in legal research. After judicial reform and the criticism of their old legal views and self-transformation in recent years, many old jurists have made great progress. Therefore, those who are able to teach today should be helped to teach. Chinese jurisprudence works and legal history materials have been very rich for thousands of years. The codes of each dynasty since the Tang Dynasty have also been preserved intact.整理和注释这些东西，是需要很大的力量的；其次，翻译介绍世界法学名著和法制史料，也需要各方面的力量去做。据我了解，各高等院校和研究机关，在团结和使用老教授、旧的学者和调动一切积极因素上，恐怕法学方面是做的最差的了。这主要是由于在我们的工作中存在着某种程度的宗派主义倾向，而这种倾向又和有些同志对于司法改革反旧法观点斗争的了解有不正确处有关。司法改革主要是反对司法人员中当时存在的严重的旧法观点和衙门作风，反对贪赃枉法，胡作非为，严重脱离群众的现象，从而从思想上、组织上纯洁各级人民法院，保证人民司法制度的确立和党的司法政策的贯彻。这是完全必要的、正确的。但反对司法人员在运用法律上的旧法观点以及工作上的衙门作风，同反对资产阶级的法学观点虽有联系，却并不是一回事，更不是否认过去的法学历史，历史只能批判它，是无法否定的。研究中国法学而否认国民党统治时期的这一段法学的历史，并不是历史唯物主义的态度。不仅这样，正因为资产阶级法学在今天还有它的影响，才更需要用马克思列宁主义观点去批判它，以教育人民和干部。在这方面过去做的还是太少。而贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，不仅可以有力地克服今天我国法学上还存在着的教条主义的倾向和其他某些缺点，使我国这支年青的法学队伍很快成长起来，同时也是用马克思列宁主义观点批判和克服资产阶级法学观点，以教育人民和提高干部的好方法。

To improve our country's legal system is by no means an easy task. Do not think that all problems will be solved once the Party's instructions are given. This is still a process of struggle. Today, the key to improving the legal system lies in formulating complete laws (first formulating criminal law and criminal procedure law) and strengthening law-abiding education for cadres. Although there are still many difficulties on the road to improving the national legal system, we believe that these difficulties can be completely overcome under the leadership of the Party.

(V)

We firmly believe that the socialist legal system is incomparably superior to the capitalist legal system, that our people's democracy is many times more democratic than bourgeois democracy, and that our people's democratic system is an entire era ahead of the capitalist system. Of course, this does not mean that our legal construction has been done very well and does not need to be improved further. No. As far as our China is concerned, our people's democratic legal system is still in the early stage of construction, and it still needs great development. It will take a long process to complete the country's legal system and penetrate people's hearts, and to make socialist principles and morality the conscious action norms of 600 million people. When people no longer feel bound by abiding by the law, and when everyone in society recognizes "necessity" and becomes truly free, there will be no more illegal and criminal things happening. By then, the state will completely disappear, and laws and legal systems will no longer be needed.

"The ultimate goal of punishment is no punishment." In China's past exploitative class society, this was just a nice-sounding phrase, just people's yearning for a better future life, which has never been realized and can never be realized. Today, in our country, this lofty ideal of the Chinese people for a better future life has had sufficient conditions for realization because the exploitative system has been basically eliminated. The Eighth National Congress of the Party proposed formulating complete laws and improving our country's legal system, which is an important step towards realizing this ideal of human beings for a better life and reaching a communist society of "no punishment." It can also be said to be a new starting point.

### 为健全我国人民民主法制而斗争

    为健全我国人民民主法制而斗争
    李琪
    （一）
    党的第八次全国代表大会对于健全我国人民民主法制的问题，给了很大的注意。刘少奇同志在党中央委员会的政治报告中指出：“我们目前在国家工作中的迫切任务之一，是着手系统地制定比较完备的法律，健全我们国家的法制。”董必武同志在大会上就加强党对法制工作的领导问题，作了专题发言，提出了许多健全法制的必要措施，并严厉批评了轻视法制的错误倾向。最后，大会关于政治报告的决议中，确定必须进一步加强我国人民民主法制，并强调指出：“一切国家机关和国家工作人员必须严格遵守国家的法律，使人民的民主权利充分地受到国家的保护。”党的第八次全国代表大会关于健全我国法制的指示以及对立法工作提出的任务，是完全符合我国社会主义建设的需要和全国人民的愿望的，也是给我国法律工作者和司法工作者的很大的支持和鼓舞。
    （二）
    我国的人民民主法制，是属于世界上最革命、最进步的社会主义类型的法制，它是在我国工人阶级领导的民主革命和社会主义革命斗争中发展起来的，是维护革命胜利的成果，保障公民的民主权利，对国内外敌人实行专政的有力武器。
    还在国内革命战争的各个时期，随着各个革命根据地的建立和发展，人民革命政府就制定了不少的、必要的法律和法令，建立了革命法制。这对巩固革命根据地的秩序，支持群众的斗争，争取战争的胜利，是起了很大的作用的。由于这时革命斗争的任务是推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，以解放全民族、解放社会生产力，而革命斗争的方法，主要是发动群众，进行武装斗争，以战胜国内外强大敌人，因而这时还不可能制定比较完备的法律和建立健全的法制。
    中华人民共和国成立后，实现了全国的统一，废除了国民党反动政府的一切压迫人民的法律、法令和司法制度，制定了作为临时宪法的“共同纲领”和其他各项保护人民的法律和法令，在全国范围内建立起人民司法制度和革命法制。但这时反革命残余势力还继续压在人民头上，必须继续发动群众，由群众直接行动，彻底肃清反革命残余势力，以巩固人民民主专政，完成民主革命尚未完成的历史任务，并给社会主义革命和社会主义建设创造良好条件。这种斗争的情势，就使新中国成立后的一个时期内，还不可能建立起健全的法制；国家颁布的法律和法令，多具有临时性和纲领性，而不是完备的法律。这在当时是完全必要的和适当的。
    现在的情况不同了。今天我们不仅已完成了民主革命的各项社会改革，基本上肃清了残余的反革命势力，召开了第一届全国人民代表大会，制定了中华人民共和国宪法，而且已经基本上完成了宪法所规定的各项社会主义改造的历史任务，取得了社会主义革命的决定胜利。为了巩固社会主义建设的秩序，这就需要有完备的法律和法制。正如刘少奇同志在政治报告中所指出的：“现在，革命的暴风雨时期已经过去了，新的生产关系已经建立起来，斗争的任务已经变为保护社会生产力的顺利发展，因此，斗争的方法也就必须跟着改变，完备的法制就是完全必要的了。”
    （三）
    有的同志认为，我们过去没有完备的法制，只是依靠党的政策，工作不也做得很好吗？我们不是取得了伟大的胜利吗？从而认为制定完备的法律，健全国家的法制，并不是当务之急。
    这种观点，是不正确的，是满足于过去已有的成就和经验从而使认识落后于实际发展的一种右倾保守思想。我们先拿同反革命作斗争来说。经过1950年和1955年下半年开始的两次大规模的镇压反革命运动之后，反革命残余势力的确已经大大地削弱了，他们进行破坏活动是已经越来越困难了，但由于他们一般地是披着伪装的外衣钻在人民内部进行隐蔽活动，所以我们也就不能像过去对付暴露的或者比较暴露的反革命分子那么容易了。道理很简单，狼和羊的区别是很清楚的，但披着羊皮的狼钻在羊群里，要识别出来就不是那么容易了。在这种情况下，如果做得不好，就很可能伤害我们自己的人，而放纵了真正的敌人。1955年下半年开始的镇压反革命运动，特别是机关肃反，由于主要是和隐蔽的敌人作斗争，所以就不如1950年的镇压反革命运动好做，就是这个道理。为了保证公安机关、检察机关和审判机关能够更好地、准确地打击各种反革命分子，只有肃反的正确政策和路线，是已经不够的了，还必须要有完备的法制。这就是说，必须要切实贯彻公安机关、检察机关和审判机关在法制方面的分工负责和互相制约的制度，使侦查、起诉、审判、劳改等工作都严格地按照法定的程序和规定进行；必须要健全审判制度和律师制度，充分保护被告人的诉讼权利和辩护权利。要做到这一步，这就不仅要进一步全面地贯彻人民法院组织法，人民检察院组织法，劳动改造条例，而且还需要完备的刑法和刑事诉讼法以及其他有关的法律。只有这样，才有可能肃清一切反革命分子，而不冤枉一个好人。
    其次，今天由于“斗争的任务已经变为保护社会生产力的顺利发展”，因而革命法制的锋芒，已经不仅仅是同反革命分子作斗争，而且还必须加强同一切危害社会管理秩序和公民权利的其他犯罪分子作斗争。只强调和反革命分子作斗争，而忽视或放松和其他犯罪分子作斗争，显然是不妥当的。至于有的人把各种刑事犯罪行为都归结为反革命行为，或者都按惩治反革命条例治罪，那更是不妥当的；因为这不仅会把肃反扩大化，而且也势必会造成一部分非反革命案件判刑不当，即罪与刑不相适应。国家的利益应该受到充分的保护，同一切危害国家利益的犯罪行为作斗争，这是我们公安机关、检察机关、审判机关的光荣的神圣职责；同时，公民的权利也应该受到充分的保护，同一切危害公民权利的犯罪行为作斗争，也同样是我们公安机关、检察机关、审判机关的光荣的神圣职责，把两者对立起来而重公轻私的观点，或者对公民权利遭受侵犯采取漠不关心的态度，显然都是不正确的，是不符合党的“使人民的民主权利充分地受到国家的保护”的要求的。我国的人民民主法制和资本主义国家的法制的根本区别之一，就在于：每个公民的权利都充分地受到国家的保护，一切犯罪行为，不管侵犯的是国家的利益还是公民的权利，国家都要负责追究到底，绝不允许应受法律制裁的犯罪者——不管他的社会地位有多么高——逍遥法外。特别是由于社会主义改造的胜利，刑事案件已大大减少，民事案件已相对地日益增加（据1956年4月份河北、北京等十四个省、市的统计，人民法院受理的民事案件已经占到收案总数的62.9％）。为了充分保护公民的权利，发挥人民建设社会主义的积极性和创造性，为了建立正常的社会生活和社会生产的秩序，调整社会关系，促进生产和物质文化生活的发展，就必须要有比较完备的法律，要有刑法、民法、诉讼法以及其他一些基本法。没有这些完备的法律，要教育人民，预防犯罪，巩固和发展社会主义的经济基础，并彻底纠正司法工作中存在的某些混乱的不合理的现象，是很困难的。因之，党的第八次全国代表大会提出制定比较完备的法律，健全我国的法制，乃是完全符合我们斗争的需要的。
    当然，把法律看成万能，以为有了完备的法律，一切问题就可迎刃而解，因而就可以高枕无忧，就可以肃清一切反革命分子，就可以不再发生任何错案，那当然也是不对的。不过，今天的问题，还不在这里，而在于我们的法律还不完备，而在于如党的第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议所指出的，需要“逐步地系统地制定完备的法律”。
    有的同志认为，“有了完备的法制，就会束缚我们的手足，反而对工作不利。”这种观点也是错误的。
    我国的人民民主法制的基本原则，就是国家机关的活动必须依据法律，不能超出法律规定的限制以外，一切国家机关工作人员和公民都必须遵守法律，而制止一切违法行为。因之，健全法制在一定意义上说来，正就是为了束缚人们的手足，但它不是束缚人们去进行反对国内外敌人的手足，不是束缚人们去为国家、为人民、为人类谋利益求幸福的手足，而是束缚那些反革命分子和一切犯罪分子去进行犯罪活动的手足，而是束缚国家工作人员中那些滥用职权，擅作威福，营私舞弊，贪污受贿，侵犯国家利益和公民权利的分子的手足，使他们奉公守法，勤恳工作，不得违法乱纪。这对工作有什么不好呢？对国家、对人民有什么不好呢？只有好处，没有害处。在我国人民民主制度下，法律越完备，法制越健全，国家的利益和公民的权利，就越能得到充分的保护，我国人民就越能迅速地摆脱今天还影响着人们的行动和生活的某些封建主义的、资本主义的观念和恶习，反革命分子和一切犯罪分子就越能减少，如果他们敢于进行犯罪活动，也就越容易被揭发。因为法律规定了何种行为是犯罪，何种行为不是犯罪，何者是法律禁止的，何者是法律保护的，这不仅可以勉励人民避恶向善，并且可以鼓励人民向犯罪分子作斗争，实行群众的检察和监督，从而预防犯罪，减少犯罪。
    今天在我们某些党员和国家工作人员中存在的轻视法制的倾向，最突出的表现，就是不重视或者不遵守国家的法律，蔑视和抹煞人民的权利，把自己看成是高踞人民之上的特殊人物，甚至滥用职权，擅作威福，侵犯公民的人身和权利，表现着一种封建主义的、资本主义的特权思想。这种思想的基本特征，就是不尊重人民的权利，没有在法律上一律平等的观念。在我们的党内还存在有这种思想，也并不奇怪。旧中国是个没有民主的国家，长期的封建统治在观念形态上所形成的特权思想，在一个短的时期内是决不可能肃清的。这种思想的存在，就不能不反映到我们党内来。我们党为了肃清党内外的这些封建主义的、资本主义的思想，在过去已经做了巨大的工作，今后还要继续大力去做。我认为，为了健全我国的法制，使公民的权利受到充分的保护，反对这种特权思想以及由此而产生的各种违法行为，是非常重要的。
    轻视法制的思想，在一部分人中还有着另一个来源，这就是中国历史上的轻视法治、轻视法学的传统思想的影响。
    老子曾说过“法令滋彰，盗贼多有”的话。儒家更是主张礼治而鄙视法治的。大历史学家司马迁在“史记”“酷吏列传”序中，曾猛烈地批评过秦朝法网太密的害处，歌颂过汉朝“网漏于吞舟之鱼”的好处。几千年来人们受儒道家这种轻视法治思想的影响是很大的，这是中国在过去长时期中法学不振的一个重要原因。清末沈家本在“法学盛衰说”中对明清两代法学曾这样写过：明朝“研究法学之书，世所知者约数十家，或传或不传，盖无人重视之故也。本朝讲究法学为世所推重者不过数人，国无专科，群相鄙弃。纪文达编纂‘四库全书’‘政书类’法令之属，仅收二部，‘存目’仅收五部，其按语谓：‘刑为盛世所不能废，而亦盛世所不尚。所录略存梗概，不求备也。’夫四库目录乃奉命撰述之书，天下趋向之所属，今创此论于上，下之人从风而靡，此法学之所以日衰也。”其实纪昀的轻法学的思想，也还是受着中国儒道家的传统思想的支配，并不是他的什么“创论”。民国以后，军阀混战，枪杆子第一，根本说不上什么法制，学法律的人，又多把它当作升官发财的敲门砖，因而法学也就更不为世人所重视。今天中国科学院有很多研究所，就是没有法学研究所，党校中有很多马克思列宁主义的课程，就是没有马克思列宁主义法学的课程，不少人愿意做其他科学研究工作，而不愿意做法学研究工作。诸如此类轻视法学的现象，固然还有其他种种主客观的原因，有对问题解决的各种困难，但我觉得，中国历史上轻视法治和法学的这种传统思想还在一部分人的思想中发生作用，不能不是一个因素。
    总括以上所说，要健全我们国家的法制，在思想上，就必须同满足于过去工作的成就和经验的右倾保守思想作斗争，就必须和封建主义的、资本主义的思想作斗争，就必须和旧中国轻视法治和法学的传统思想作斗争。这一切可以归结到一点：反对脱离人民群众的资产阶级的法律思想。这就是贯彻党的第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议中关于健全我国法制的指示在政法思想战线上的主要任务。
    （四）
    为了健全我国的法制，我认为应当从以下四个方面着手。
    一、加强立法工作。董必武同志在“八大”会议上的发言对此已有具体的指示，我在这里就不再多说了。我只想说一句，就是深切地希望能够先把刑法和刑事诉讼法早日制定出来。同时应积极进行民法和民事诉讼法的起草工作。
    二、进一步健全司法机关和司法制度。在这里健全人民检察机关和律师制度具有重要的意义。检察机关是有法律最高监督之责的，全面地有力地履行自己的职责，无疑地就可大大地健全我国的司法制度。轻视检察机关的作用，认为检察机关可有可无的观点，是完全错误的。其次，律师是人民的法律顾问，通过律师的辩护，不仅可以有力地帮助被告进行诉讼，而且可以有力地帮助司法机关正确地处理案件。这一时期凡是建立了律师协会或法律顾问处，而律师又能认真负起自己职责的地方，都得到人民群众的热烈拥护，就是很好的证明。
    三、加强守法教育，反对一切违法犯罪的行为。在这方面，反对国家工作人员中的违法犯罪行为，具有着更重要的意义。这里我想从一件具体的违法事件说起。1956年8月17日光明日报登载了“在卷宗里发现的一封奇怪的信”。在这篇短文中，作者揭发了这样的事实：河北省邯郸地委会张先民要和他肥乡原籍老婆韩巧凤离婚（肥乡是邯郸地委领导下的一个县），但不经过任何法律程序，只给肥乡县人民法院去了一封密信，法院就宣告判决离婚——虽然被告韩巧凤坚决不离。这封密信是这样写的：
    “……我准备离婚，请你给我帮忙。我的意见，你接信后，不要告诉任何人，你亲自给我办一下。城附近有亲戚，说出会给我造成困难，给你也会增加一些麻烦，你说是吗？在必要时，你要采取‘果断’、‘迅速’的办法，不要拖长时间。我的意见，你头天晚上到我家动员一下，第二天，你办个手续给我送去……”
    肥乡县人民法院收信人接到这封紧急密信后，就迅速到了张先民的家里东营村，找到韩巧凤，动员她离婚，韩坚决不同意，收信人就“迅速”、“果断”地于1955年12月判决离婚，小孩暂归女方抚养，男方每月付给十元，后改判为三十元。
    有的同志看了上述这条新闻后，并没有引起注意，觉得这是个“小事”，不算什么。张先民滥用权威，审判员徇情卖法，这还是“小事”吗？国家法律是允许离婚的，为什么不正式起诉？不按照法定程序进行？难道因为我们是党和国家的干部，就可以成为高踞人民之上的“特殊人物”而不遵守国家的法律吗？而法院也就可以作出非法的判决吗？很清楚地，在这种情况下，要使公民的权利受到充分的保护，是决不可能的。我认为要健全我们国家的法制，确立我国严格的法治精神，就必须从认真揭露和处理这些“小事”做起，并广为宣传，使党员和国家工作人员都清楚地了解到，即使是这些“小事”，国家也是不允许的。
    四、加强法律科学工作。这是个大问题。这里我想只提出以下几点意见。（一）应下决心把法学研究所成立起来，拖得过久，对工作是会有损害的。如果干部不能一下配备齐，可先成立些小组，开始工作。（二）必须坚持从中国实际出发研究马克思列宁主义法学的方针和毛主席关于“善于学习”的指示。解放后七年来，在法学方面总的说来，是贯彻了党中央的这一正确方针的。但也不容否认，在一些人中还存在有不考虑中国实际情况，不加分析地机械搬用外国经验的教条主义的偏向。今天中国的法学，还处在一个幼年时代，还没有走上它的独创阶段，这要靠全国法学家们的努力，同时国家早日制定出各种基本法典，也会有力地促进中国法学派的形成和发展。经过七年来的努力，我国今天在法学战线上已有了一支生气勃勃的新的年青的队伍，它的弱点是战斗力还不强，知识准备还不够，并在某些方面还存在有教条主义的偏向。克服的办法，就是“善于学习”。毛泽东同志在党的第八次全国代表大会开幕词中所指示的“学习，再学习”，向世界各国人民学习，对我国法学工作者来说，更有着特殊的意义。（三）在法学研究上要调动一切积极因素，贯彻党的“百家争鸣”的方针。不少旧法学者经过司法改革对自己旧法观点的批判以及这几年来的自我改造，已有了很大进步，因之今天能够开课的，应帮助他们开课。几千年来中国法学著作和法制史料是很丰富的，自唐以下各朝的法典也都保存无缺，整理和注释这些东西，是需要很大的力量的；其次，翻译介绍世界法学名著和法制史料，也需要各方面的力量去做。据我了解，各高等院校和研究机关，在团结和使用老教授、旧的学者和调动一切积极因素上，恐怕法学方面是做的最差的了。这主要是由于在我们的工作中存在着某种程度的宗派主义倾向，而这种倾向又和有些同志对于司法改革反旧法观点斗争的了解有不正确处有关。司法改革主要是反对司法人员中当时存在的严重的旧法观点和衙门作风，反对贪赃枉法，胡作非为，严重脱离群众的现象，从而从思想上、组织上纯洁各级人民法院，保证人民司法制度的确立和党的司法政策的贯彻。这是完全必要的、正确的。但反对司法人员在运用法律上的旧法观点以及工作上的衙门作风，同反对资产阶级的法学观点虽有联系，却并不是一回事，更不是否认过去的法学历史，历史只能批判它，是无法否定的。研究中国法学而否认国民党统治时期的这一段法学的历史，并不是历史唯物主义的态度。不仅这样，正因为资产阶级法学在今天还有它的影响，才更需要用马克思列宁主义观点去批判它，以教育人民和干部。在这方面过去做的还是太少。而贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，不仅可以有力地克服今天我国法学上还存在着的教条主义的倾向和其他某些缺点，使我国这支年青的法学队伍很快成长起来，同时也是用马克思列宁主义观点批判和克服资产阶级法学观点，以教育人民和提高干部的好方法。
    健全我们国家的法制，这决不是一件容易的事，决不要以为有了党的指示就什么问题都解决了，这还是一个斗争的过程。今天健全法制的关键在于：制定完备的法律（首先制定刑法和刑事诉讼法）和加强干部的守法教育。虽然在健全国家法制的道路上还存在着许多困难，但我们相信，在党的领导下，这些困难是完全可以克服的。
    （五）
   我们坚信，社会主义法制要比资本主义法制优越到不可比拟，我们的人民民主比资产阶级民主要民主得不知多少倍，我们的人民民主制度要比资本主义制度前进整整一个时代。当然这并不是说，我们的法制建设一切都已经做得很好了，不需要再改进了。不是的。就我们中国来说，我们的人民民主法制还处在建设的初期，还需要有很大的发展，要使国家的法制完备起来并深入人心，使社会主义原则、道德成为六亿人民自觉的行动规范，还需要一个很长的过程。等到人们对守法不再有束缚手足之感，等到社会上每个人都认识了“必然”而成为真正自由之人的时候，就不会再有违法犯罪的事情发生了，到那时候国家也就完全消亡了，法律、法制也就用不着了。
    “刑期于无刑”，在中国过去剥削阶级社会里，只是一句好听的话，只是人们对于未来美好生活的向往，是从来没有实现过和永远不能实现的。中国人民这种对未来美好生活的崇高理想，今天在我们的国家里，由于已基本上消灭了剥削制度，已经有了充分实现的条件。党的第八次全国代表大会提出要制定完备的法律，健全我国的法制，就是为了实现人类这种美好生活的理想，达到“无刑”的共产主义社会的一个重要步骤，也可以说是一个新的起点。
