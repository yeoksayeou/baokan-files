    The Blood of the Hungarian Communists Was Not Shed in Vain
  　Our Correspondent　Hu Sisheng
    "They murdered many of our respected fighters who had struggled for decades:
    Imre Mező, Secretary of the Budapest Party Committee, an old fighter of the Csepel workers' movement… They also massively murdered other prestigious sons of the working class and peasantry.” These are a few sentences from an open letter signed by Apro (Minister of Heavy Industry of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government), Kádár (Prime Minister of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government), and two others at a critical moment for the Hungarian socialist cause. This letter used the fact of the counter-revolutionaries' murder of communists to open the eyes of many patriots.
    On the morning of October 30th, counter-revolutionary bandits began to surround the Budapest City Party Committee headquarters located in Republic Square. At the same time, the Party Committees in various districts were also surrounded. In order to incite some of the deceived masses, the counter-revolutionaries spread rumors that many ordinary people were being held in the basement of the City Party Committee. The bandits mobilized tanks and artillery to attack the City Party Committee building. Many staff members were injured. In order to protect the lives of other Party workers, Comrade Imre Mező, the City Party Secretary, personally went out with two officers to negotiate with the attackers. As soon as Comrade Mező stepped out the door, a volley of prepared bullets hit him…
    This volley of bullets was a signal for a major offensive. The bandits swarmed into the City Party Committee building, treating every Party worker inside with extreme barbarity. Some comrades were beheaded after being beaten to death, some were doused with gasoline and burned alive, and some were subjected to lingering death. The counter-revolutionaries inhumanely dug out the hearts of the victims and displayed them for all to see. Even the barber working in the building was not spared. They beat the barber unconscious and forced him to admit that he was a Communist Party member. When the barber protested, the bandits killed him. During this day of white terror, the blood of countless Communist Party members taught the people: leniency towards counter-revolutionaries is cruelty towards the people.
    On November 1st, after struggling on the edge of death for several hours, Comrade Imre Mező's heart stopped beating. Shortly before his death, he used his last strength to say two sentences to his wife: "Tell Comrade Kádár to be stronger and to pay attention to his own safety." Then he added: "Raise the two children well." These two sentences became the last words of a fighter who had dedicated his life to the cause of the working class.
    Recently, we met Comrade Imre Né, the wife of Comrade Imre Mező. Comrade Imre Né and her husband had worked tirelessly for the Party's cause together for over twenty years. As soon as we met, her inner grief quickly spread to us. She was wearing black clothes and sitting on the sofa in the living room, talking about Comrade Mező's life in a slow and heavy tone.
    "Comrade Mező was born into a poor peasant family. He herded livestock from the age of nine and never went to school. At the age of thirteen, he went to a neighboring village to learn tailoring. His impoverished life did not prevent him from studying diligently on his own. In 1927, he joined the Communist Party in Belgium. From then on, he began his conscious struggle for the cause of communism. Soon after, he became a leader of a secret Hungarian Party organization in Belgium. During his time in Belgium, he was arrested several times and once deported. But these tortures did not diminish his will to fight in the slightest. In 1936, when fascist troops attacked Spain, Mező joined the International Brigades and fought against fascism in Spain, where he was wounded twice. He left Spain in 1939. After that, Mező continued to do Party work in France and other places until the liberation of Hungary. In liberated Hungary, Mező continued to engage in Party work, successively serving as the Organization Minister of the Budapest City Committee and the City Party Secretary.”
    "Comrade Mező liked to be close to the workers, and the workers also liked to talk to him. Therefore, Comrade Mező deeply felt the adverse consequences of the mistakes made by Rákosi and others in recent years in real life. He reported to the Central Committee more than once, reflecting the living conditions and demands of the masses. He opposed Rákosi's practice of excluding old Marxists, and he opposed the style of some leaders who did not care about the hardships of the masses. He often said that the monthly salary of Party cadres working in factories was only six hundred and eighty forints, which was not enough to support a family. He also opposed the bad habit of Party leaders being aloof and not going to factories and rural areas. However, Rákosi and others ignored these opinions, thinking that the situation he reflected was too one-sided. In the past, the bureaucratic style of leaders being detached from the masses often made Comrade Mező restless. He deeply knew that the domestic situation was serious."
    Comrade Imre Né thought and talked, her tone becoming more and more firm. She finally said in a heavier tone: "Although we are now in a difficult period, we are not isolated. … I have been doing Party work since I was young, and I will continue to do Party work in the future, and do my best for the Party's cause. As for the two children, I will definitely raise them well to become successors to Comrade Mező's cause."
    Comrade Mező and many outstanding sons of the Hungarian working class have sacrificed themselves. The counter-revolutionary forces wanted to kill them because they knew that Communists were loyal fighters for the socialist cause. The counter-revolutionary forces thought that killing Communists would enable them to easily overthrow the worker-peasant regime. However, when the counter-revolution began to kill Communists, they thoroughly exposed themselves as enemies of the people. The blood of the Hungarian Communists has awakened all honest Hungarians to rise up and fight to defeat the counter-revolutionaries' vicious plots and save the socialist cause. The blood of the Hungarian Communists was not shed in vain.

    匈牙利共产党人的血不是白流的
  　本报记者　胡思升
    “他们杀害了我们的许多曾经在数十年中进行斗争的可敬的战士：
    布达佩斯党委员会书记伊姆雷·麦泽，切佩尔工人运动的老战士……他们还大规模地杀害了工人阶级和农民的其他有声望的儿子。”这是在匈牙利社会主义事业生死存亡关头时由奥普罗（匈牙利工农革命政府重工业部长）、卡达尔（匈牙利工农革命政府总理）等四人签署发出的一封公开信中的几句话。这封信用反革命分子杀害共产党员的血的事实擦亮了许多爱国者的眼睛。
    10月30日上午，反革命匪徒开始包围位于共和国广场的布达佩斯市党委会总部，与此同时，各区的党委会也被包围了。为了煽动一部分被蒙蔽的群众，反革命分子造谣说在市党委会地下室禁闭了许多老百姓。匪徒们动员了坦克和炮来攻击市党委会大楼。很多工作人员被打伤了。为了保护其他党的工作人员的生命，市委书记伊姆雷·麦泽同志亲自同两个军官一起出外同进攻者谈判。麦泽同志刚走出门，一排准备好的子弹打在他的身上……。
    这一排子弹是一个大举进攻的信号，匪徒们蜂拥而入市党委会大楼，以极端野蛮的手段对待大楼内的每一个党的工作人员。有些同志被打死后又被割下头来，有的被浇上汽油后烧死，有一些同志被凌迟，反革命分子毫无人性地把被害人的心挖出来示众。甚至连在大楼内工作的理发师也难幸免，他们把这个理发师打昏过去，硬逼他承认是共产党员。当这个理发师申辩时，匪徒们就把他打死了。在这个白色恐怖的日子里，无数共产党员的鲜血教育了人们：对反革命分子的宽大，就是对人民的残忍。
    11月1日，经过几个小时在死亡边缘的挣扎，伊姆雷·麦泽同志的心脏停止了跳动。在逝世前不久，他用他最后的精力向他的夫人吐出了两句话：“转告卡达尔同志，叫他更坚强起来，同时注意自己的安全。”接着又说：“好好扶养两个孩子。”这两句话就成了毕生为工人阶级事业奋斗不懈的战士的最后遗言。
    最近，我们会见了伊姆雷·麦泽同志的夫人伊姆雷·耐同志。伊姆雷·耐同志同她的丈夫二十多年来一起为党的事业奋斗不懈。我们一见面，她那内心的悲痛迅速地传给了我们。她穿着黑色的衣服，坐在客厅内的沙发上，用缓慢而沉重的声调谈起麦泽同志的一生。
    “麦泽同志生在一个贫苦农民的家庭。九岁起就放牲口，从来没有上过学。十三岁到邻村去学裁缝。贫困的生活没有阻止他刻苦的自学。1927年，他在比利时加入了共产党。从此就开始了他自觉地为共产主义事业奋斗的生活。不久后他成了在比利时的匈牙利党的秘密组织的一个领导人。在比利时的时期，他几次被捕，有一次被驱逐出境。但是这些折磨丝毫没有挫折他的斗争的意志。1936年，法西斯军队进攻西班牙，麦泽参加了国际纵队，在西班牙为反法西斯而战斗，他受了两次伤。于1939年离开了西班牙。在这以后，麦泽在法国等地继续做党的工作，一直到匈牙利解放。在解放后的匈牙利，麦泽继续从事党的工作，先后任布达佩斯市委会组织部长和市委书记。”
    “麦泽同志很喜欢接近工人，工人也很喜欢同他谈话。因此麦泽同志深深地感觉到最近几年来拉科西等所犯的错误在实际生活中引起的不良后果。他不止一次地向中央写报告，反映群众的生活情况和要求。他反对拉科西排斥老的马克思主义者的做法，他反对某些领导人不关心群众生活疾苦的作风。他时常说，在工厂工作的党的干部每月薪金只有六百八十福林，这是不能养活家庭的。他也反对党的领导高高在上不下工厂农村的恶习。但是拉科西等人对这些意见都置之不理，认为他反映的情况太片面。过去领导人这种脱离群众的官僚主义作风常常使麦泽同志寝食不安。他深深知道国内的情况是严重的。”
    伊姆雷·耐同志一面想，一面谈，语调越来越坚定了。她最后以加重的语调说：“虽然现在我们处在困难的时期，但我们并不是孤立的。……我从年轻时起就从事党的工作，我以后还要做党的工作，为党的事业尽力。至于两个小孩，我一定好好把他们扶养成为麦泽同志事业的继承人。”
    麦泽同志和匈牙利工人阶级的许多优秀儿子是牺牲了。反革命势力所以要杀害他们，是因为他们知道共产党人是社会主义事业的忠诚战士。反革命力量以为，杀死共产党人就能够使他们轻而易举地推翻工农的政权。但是，当反革命一开始杀害共产党人的时候，他们就彻底暴露出自己是人民的敌人。匈牙利共产党人的血唤醒了一切正直的匈牙利人起来为击败反革命的毒辣图谋、挽救社会主义事业而斗争。匈牙利共产党人的血不是白流的。
