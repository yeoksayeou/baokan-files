    China's Foreign Trade Develops Rapidly
    Complete Sets of Machinery and Equipment and Steel Begin to Be Exported
    (Our dispatch from Guangzhou, 7th) In recent years, China's foreign trade work has greatly developed along with the achievements of China's economic construction. On the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty, China has now established trade relations with sixty-eight countries and regions, of which twenty-one countries have signed intergovernmental trade agreements with China. In 1955, China's total import and export trade volume was 2.6 times that of the early post-liberation period of 1950. China's trade with Asian and African countries in 1955 saw a 18.4% increase in the total import and export trade volume compared to 1954.
    With the continuous growth of China's industrial and agricultural production and the increasing scale of economic construction, China's need for imported materials is increasing day by day; there have also been great changes in export commodities. Now, not only has the quantity and variety of China's traditional export commodities increased year by year, but many industrial products have also been exported to foreign countries as new varieties. In the past year or more, China has successively exported steel produced in China to Burma, India, and Egypt. Many heavy industrial products such as various machine tools, complete sets of light industrial equipment, water conservancy irrigation equipment, electric motors, diesel engines... and other products can be exported or have begun to be exported. In June of this year, the governments of China and Cambodia signed an agreement on economic assistance. According to this agreement, China will supply Cambodia with the equipment and materials needed to establish textile factories, cement factories, paper mills, plywood factories, as well as to develop agricultural water conservancy, supply rural electricity, and build universities, hospitals, gymnasiums, roads, and bridges. In July of this year, China also signed a contract with Burma to supply Burma with complete sets of equipment for building textile factories. In 1950, China's exports of industrial products accounted for only 15.4% of the total export value, but in 1955 this had increased to 40.4%. In the future, it will certainly provide more export materials to promote international cooperation and improve the lives of people in all countries.

    我国对外贸易发展迅速
    成套机械设备和钢材开始输出
    本报广州7日电　我国对外贸易工作，几年来随着我国经济建设的成就有了很大的发展。在平等互利和互相尊重主权的基础上，目前我国已同六十八个国家和地区建立贸易关系，其中有二十一个国家同我国签订有政府间贸易协定。1955年我国进出口贸易总额为解放初期1950年的二点六倍。我国同亚非国家的贸易，1955年的进出口贸易总额比1954年增加18.4％。
    随着我国工农业生产不断增长和经济建设规模日益扩大，我国所需要进口物资正日益增加；出口商品也有很大变化。现在，不仅我国传统的出口商品的数量和品种已逐年增加，许多工业产品也作为新品种向外国出口了。最近一年多来，我国曾先后向缅甸、印度、埃及输出了我国生产的钢材。许多重工业产品如各种工作母机、轻工业成套设备、水利灌溉设备、电动机、柴油机……等产品也可以出口或已开始出口。今年6月，我国同柬埔寨两国政府签订了关于经济援助的协定，根据这个协定，我国将供应柬埔寨建立纺织厂、水泥厂、造纸厂、胶合板厂以及如发展农业水利、供应农村电力和建设大学、医院、体育馆、道路、桥梁等所需要的设备和物资。今年7月我国也同缅甸签订了供应缅甸建设纺织厂成套设备的合同。1950年我国出口的工业产品只占出口总额15.4％，1955年已提高到40.4％。今后必将提供更多的出口物资，以促进国际间的合作和改善各国人民的生活。
