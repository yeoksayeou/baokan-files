	The leaves of the two rows of elm trees have fallen, and their gray-black branches stretch into the air.
	The Smolny Institute is nestled deep within the woods, with only a red flag fluttering on the roof visible from a distance.
	Here, we first see two short, colonnaded corridor-like buildings. On the left is written: "The First Soviet of the Proletarian Dictatorship"; on the right: "Workers of All Countries, Unite!"
	All around is quiet. The azure sky sets off the oil-yellow walls of the Smolny Institute, making it appear both solemn and elegant. A full-body bronze statue of Lenin stands before us, his gaze fixed on the distance, his right arm extended, pointing the way forward. His face is so kind, his spirit so concentrated, we seem to hear him saying: "Comrades! Advance from here!"
	Thirty-nine years ago, he stood on these steps, announcing the plan and route of the offensive to the revolutionary soldiers; here he led the October Revolution…
	Thirty-nine years ago, when darkness fell upon the earth, Petrograd was pitch black, without streetlights, without pedestrians, only the windows of the Smolny Institute glowed with light. Teams of armed workers came from all corners of the city to receive their offensive tasks…
	I stood here for a long time.
	Smolny Institute! How many historical events are linked to you! Thirty-nine years ago, representatives of workers, peasants, and soldiers from all over came into the hall of the Smolny Institute, where they established the first Soviet regime, where they wrote the first Soviet decrees: Land to the people, stop the war! …
	The autumn sun has already hidden behind the trees, and the evening wind is biting.
	An old man was sitting on a long chair. I walked over and asked him, "Uncle, aren't you cold sitting here?"
	"No, comrade, I'm not resting, I'm waiting for my granddaughter."
	"Where did she go?"
	The old man pointed to a building not far away and said to me, "She is studying at that school."
	After a while, several eight- or nine-year-old girls ran to the old man's side like a flock of sparrows. The old man asked them, "Children, why are you so late getting out of school today?"
	The children scrambled to answer, "We practiced singing today. We are going to celebrate the October Revolution Day."

    在斯摩尔尼宫门前
    左钊
    两行榆树的叶子已经落光，灰黑色的枝桠伸在空中。
    斯摩尔尼宫埋在树林的深处，从远处看只有一面红旗飘在屋顶。
    在这里，我们首先看到的是两个不长的带园柱的走廊式的建筑，在左边写着：“无产阶级专政的第一个苏维埃”；在右边写着：“全世界无产者，联合起来！”
    四周静静的。蔚蓝色的天空衬上斯摩尔尼宫油黄的墙壁，显得又庄严，又幽雅。列宁的全身铜像立在我们面前，他的眼光注视着远方，他伸着右臂指着前进的方向，他的面容是这样亲切，他的精神是如此集中，我们似乎听他在说：“同志们！从这里前进！”
    三十九年前他就站在这个台阶上，向革命士兵宣布着进攻的计划和路线；在这里他领导了十月革命……。
    三十九年前，当黑夜降临大地的时候，彼得堡一片漆黑，没有路灯，没有行人，只有斯摩尔尼宫的窗子里闪耀着灯光。一队队武装起来的工人，从城市的各个角落来到这里领取进攻的任务……。
    我久久地站在这里。
    斯摩尔尼宫！有多少历史事件和你连在一起！三十九年前，从各地来的工农兵代表走进了斯摩尔尼宫的大厅，在这里他们建立了第一个苏维埃政权，在这里写了第一道苏维埃法令：土地归人民，停止战争！…………
    秋天的太阳已经藏在树后，晚风袭人。
    在一个长椅子上坐着一位老人，我走过去问他：“老伯伯，您在这里休息不冷吗？”
    “不，同志，我不是在休息，我在等我的孙女儿。”
    “她到什么地方去了？”
    老人指着不远的一座楼房向我说：“她在那个学校上学。”
    过了一会，几个八、九岁的小姑娘像群小麻雀一样跑到老人的身边。老人问他们：“孩子们，今天放学为什么这么晚呢？”
    孩子们抢着回答说：“我们今天练歌，我们要庆祝十月革命节。”
