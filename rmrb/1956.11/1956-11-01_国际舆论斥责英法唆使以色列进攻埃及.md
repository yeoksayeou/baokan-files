Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 31st - According to TASS, Anwar Sadat wrote in "The Republic" that Israel's armed invasion of Egypt proves that "the imperialist offensive against the Arab people has reached its peak."
    Other Egyptian newspapers also emphasized the seriousness of the situation caused by Western countries instigating the Israeli army to invade Egyptian territory.
    "People's News" pointed out: "Today we are facing not only Israel but the entire strength of Western imperialism. ... Arab nationalism will become a major force, which the imperialist countries will never be reconciled to. The imperialist countries know very well that the victory of Arab nationalism is the end of imperialist rule over the extremely important region of the Arab East."
    "Al-Ahram" pointed out the imperialist conspiracy against Arab countries and said that Israel played an important role in this conspiracy. The newspaper said that London, Paris, and Tel Aviv meticulously planned the details of this conspiracy last week.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, October 31st - According to TASS, the Lebanese "Telegraph" said: "We accuse the West of instigating Israel to start a war."
    The newspaper said: "The purpose of Israel's attack is to create reasons for Western countries to intervene, to ensure that Western countries can land and seize some bases, including the Suez Canal."
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 31st - When Islamic Teachers Association leader Darlan commented on the Israeli army's invasion of Egypt on October 30th, he told an Antara News Agency reporter, "We should of course express our solidarity with Egypt."
    He said that Israel had once again violated the ceasefire agreement and launched an open attack on Egypt. He demanded that the Security Council impose sanctions on Israel.
    Mrs. Pujo Bintoro, Chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, said that Israel's attack on the Egyptian border has complicated the situation.
    She added that she, in principle, advocates the peaceful resolution of all international disputes, but if Israel refuses to withdraw peacefully, the Security Council should take immediate action.
    "East Star News" and "Independent News" both believe today that Israel's attack on Egypt is closely related to the Suez Canal dispute and point out that Britain played an important role behind the scenes.
    "Independent News" said that through military attacks, Britain seems to want to prevent the realization of Arab unity and destroy the Nasser government.
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 31st - Calcutta dispatch: Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe said in Calcutta today that the recent developments on the Suez Canal issue constitute "the most serious threat to peace."
    U Ba Swe arrived in Calcutta by plane today with a 21-member delegation from Yangon en route to Bombay to attend the Asian Socialist Party Conference.
    U Ba Swe said that the situation in the Suez area has reached a point where incidents can happen at any time, but "we will strive to maintain peace."
    Xinhua News Agency, October 31st - Tokyo News: Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu issued a statement this afternoon saying that the Japanese government hopes that the Middle East issue can be resolved peacefully, and that the Japanese government will adhere to the policy of non-interference in other countries' disputes and do its utmost to maintain peace.

    国际舆论斥责英法唆使以色列进攻埃及
    埃及
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社开罗30日讯：安瓦尔·萨达特在“共和国报”上写道，以色列武装侵犯埃及这一事件证明，“帝国主义对阿拉伯人民的进攻已到了顶点的时刻”。
    埃及其他报纸也都强调指出西方国家指使以色列军队侵犯埃及领土所造成的局势的严重性。
    “人民报”指出：“今天我们面对着的不仅是以色列，而且是西方帝国主义的全部力量。……阿拉伯民族主义将成为一种重大的力量，这是帝国主义国家永远不甘心的。帝国主义国家知道得很清楚，阿拉伯民族主义的胜利，这就是帝国主义对阿拉伯东方极其重要地区的统治的告终。”
    “金字塔报”指出，帝国主义对阿拉伯国家的阴谋，并且说以色列在这一阴谋中担当了重要角色。这家报纸说，伦敦、巴黎、特拉维夫在上一星期详细地策划了这一阴谋的细节。    黎巴嫩
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社贝鲁特30日讯：黎巴嫩“电讯报”说：“我们控告西方，因为它唆使以色列发动战争。”
    这家报纸说：“以色列的进攻目的，是给西方国家制造理由来进行干涉，是保证西方国家能够登陆以夺取包括苏伊士运河在内的某些基地。”
    印度尼西亚
    新华社雅加达31日电  伊斯兰教师联合会领袖达兰10月30日在就以色列军队侵略埃及一事发表评论的时候，对安塔拉通讯社记者说，“我们当然应当表示我们对埃及的声援。”
    他说，以色列再度违反了停火协定，对埃及发动了公开的攻击。他要求安全理事会对以色列进行制裁。
    议会外交小组委员会主席普佐邦托罗夫人说，以色列对埃及边境发动的攻击使得局势变得更加复杂了。
    她又说，她在原则上是主张和平解决一切国际纠纷的，但是如果以色列拒绝和平撤退的话，安理会应当立刻采取行动。
    “东星报”和“独立报”今天都认为以色列对埃及发动的攻击是同苏伊士运河纠纷密切相联的，并且指出英国在后面起了重要的作用。
    “独立报”说，通过军事攻击，英国似乎想防止阿拉伯国家的团结实现，并且摧毁纳赛尔政府。
    缅甸
    新华社新德里31日电　加尔各答消息：缅甸总理吴巴瑞今天在加尔各答说，最近在苏伊士运河问题上的发展形成了“对和平的最严重的威胁”。
    吴巴瑞是率领一个二十一人的代表团今天从仰光前往孟买出席亚洲社会党会议的途中乘飞机到达加尔各答的。
    吴巴瑞说，苏伊士地区的局势到了任何时候都会发生事端的地步，但是“我们将努力维持和平”。
    日本
    新华社31日讯　东京消息：日本外务相重光葵今天下午发表谈话说，日本政府希望中东的问题能够得到和平解决，日本政府要坚持不干预别国的争端、竭尽全力维持和平的方针。
