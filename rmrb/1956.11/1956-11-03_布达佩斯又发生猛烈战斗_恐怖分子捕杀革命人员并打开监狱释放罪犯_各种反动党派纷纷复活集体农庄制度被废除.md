Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 2nd: Budapest Dispatch: The struggle between terrorists and revolutionary forces is continuing in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. This morning, fierce fighting broke out again in Budapest, with barricades being erected in the streets and machine guns firing.

In Budapest and other parts of Hungary, armed terrorists are engaging in terrorist activities. The main targets of their searches and killings are soldiers of the Public Security Forces. It has been reported that mobs soaked the corpses of dozens of murdered Public Security Forces soldiers in gasoline and set them on fire. During the attack on a party branch of the Hungarian Working People's Party on October 31st, terrorists hung captured personnel upside down and beat them to death. At the same time, counter-revolutionaries set up checkpoints all over Budapest to search for leaders of state organs and the Working People's Party.

In recent days, in Budapest and many areas where disturbances have occurred, armed terrorists have opened prisons and released criminals sentenced to imprisonment for various crimes since the establishment of the people's government, including bandits and drunkards. These social dregs have fueled the atmosphere of terror in the area. For example, on October 31st, Budapest Radio broadcast news about prisoners released from prisons engaging in looting.

According to Budapest Radio, a minister of the Nagy government announced the abolition of the collective farm system from October 30th. In Szekszárd, the "National Committee" of rioters announced the "return" of vineyards nationalized three years ago.

In Budapest and other places, political parties of various political forces that had been overthrown by the working people have organized themselves. The former National Peasant Party announced that their party has been rebuilt in Budapest and other places, and the party is officially called the "Petőfi Party." A "Catholic Party" announced its establishment in Budapest on November 1st.

In Kecskemét, the provincial, district, and municipal organs of the Hungarian Working People's Party have been dissolved, and local organizations of the Smallholders Party have been restored.

On the afternoon of November 1st, former political prisoners released from different prisons held a conference at the "Urania" cinema in Budapest. They decided to organize a national association of former political prisoners.

At the same time, fascists and reactionaries who were driven out of Hungary after 1945 as enemies of the Hungarian people have also revived. They are gathering from all corners of the capitalist world to the western border of Hungary. According to the German News Agency on October 29th, Hungarian fascists living in camps in Nuremberg and Fürth in West Germany since the end of the war will be sent to Hungary. The West German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur announced that "some of these Hungarians have already set off to join the fighting."

According to Vienna Radio, Ferenc Nagy, the former leader of the Hungarian Smallholders Party and former Prime Minister who fled abroad in 1947, arrived in Vienna by plane on October 30th. While living in the United States after fleeing Hungary, Ferenc Nagy published a book in 1948 about preparing a reactionary coup against the People's Government in Hungary.

The so-called "free radio stations" in the Hungarian cities of Győr and Mosonmagyaróvár, near the Austrian border, are being smuggled into Hungary across the border. These radio stations receive programs from abroad, and their slogans are forwarded by the American "Radio Free Europe."

    布达佩斯又发生猛烈战斗
    恐怖分子捕杀革命人员并打开监狱释放罪犯
    各种反动党派纷纷复活集体农庄制度被废除
    新华社布拉格2日电　布达佩斯消息：匈牙利首都布达佩斯的恐怖分子和革命力量的斗争正在继续。今天早晨，布达佩斯又发生了猛烈的战斗，大街上正在敷设路障，而且还有机枪扫射。
    在布达佩斯和匈牙利其它地方，武装恐怖分子正在进行恐怖活动。被搜捕杀害的主要对象是公安部队的战士。有人看到暴徒把几十名杀害了的公安部队战士的尸体，用汽油浸过以后在放火焚烧。恐怖分子在10月31日攻击劳动人民党的一个党部的战斗中，把俘掳到的人员倒吊起来活活打死。同时，反革命分子在布达佩斯到处设立关卡，搜捕国家机关和劳动人民党的领导人员。
    这几天来，在布达佩斯和许多发生骚乱的地区，武装恐怖分子打开了监狱，把人民政权建立以来因各种罪行而被判处徒刑的犯罪分子释放出来，其中包括盗匪和酗酒罪犯等。这些社会上的残渣助长了当地的恐怖气氛。例如，10月31日，布达佩斯电台就广播了一些有关从监狱中释放出来的犯人进行抢劫的消息。
    据布达佩斯电台广播，纳吉政府的一位部长宣布从10月30日起废除集体农庄制度。在塞克萨德，骚乱分子的“国民委员会”宣布把在三年前收归国家所有的葡萄园予以“归还”。
    在布达佩斯和各地，各种过去已经被劳动人民推翻了的政治势力的政党纷纷组织起来。前国家农民党宣布，它们的党在最近布达佩斯和各地重建起来，这个党的名称已经正式叫作“裴多菲党”。一个“天主教党”11月1日宣布在布达佩斯成立。
    在刻斯克美特，匈牙利劳动人民党的省、区和市镇的机关已经被解散，而当地的小农党组织已经恢复。
    11月1日下午，从不同的监狱里释放出来的前政治犯在布达佩斯“乌拉尼亚”电影院召开了一个大会。他们决定组织一个前政治犯的全国协会。
    和这同时，那些在1945年以后作为匈牙利人民的敌人被赶出匈牙利的法西斯分子和反动分子也重新振作起来。他们纷纷从资本主义世界一切角落集结到匈牙利西部边境。据德意志通讯社10月29日报道，自从战争结束后一直居住在西德的纽伦堡和佛尔特的营地的匈牙利法西斯分子将被派遣到匈牙利去。西德通讯社德意志新闻社宣布，“这些匈牙利人中的某一些已经首途去参加战斗。”
    据维也纳电台报道，曾在1947年逃亡国外的前匈牙利小农党领袖、前总理费伦茨·纳吉，10月30日乘飞机到达了维也纳。费伦茨·纳吉在逃出匈牙利住在美国的时候，曾经在1948年出版了一本关于在匈牙利准备反对人民政府的反动政变的书。
    在靠近奥地利边境的匈牙利城市——吉厄尔和莫松马乔罗瓦——的所谓“自由电台”是越过边境运进匈牙利的。这些电台从国外得到节目，它们的口号由美国的“自由欧洲”电台转发。
