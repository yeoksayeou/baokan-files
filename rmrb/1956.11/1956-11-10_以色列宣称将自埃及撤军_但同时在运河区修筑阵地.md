Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from Jerusalem: Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, in a radio address shortly after midnight on November 8th, announced that the Israeli government "has decided to notify the United Nations Secretary-General that Israel is prepared to withdraw its troops from Egyptian territory immediately after the United Nations Emergency Force has definitely entered the Canal Zone."

Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from New York: Israel officially announced on November 8th that it would withdraw its troops from Egypt and cooperate with the United Nations police force to be sent to the Middle East.

The Israeli delegation to the United Nations has received instructions from Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir regarding this guarantee. The delegation announced: "Ambassador Eban will soon transmit to the United Nations Secretary-General a letter from Foreign Minister Golda Meir regarding Israel's guarantee to withdraw its troops from Egypt and to cooperate with the proposed United Nations force to be sent to Egypt for the purpose of achieving this goal."

However, news from Israel indicates that, to date, there are no signs of Israeli troops preparing to withdraw from Egyptian territory. United Press International, in a dispatch from Jerusalem, stated that in order to "consolidate" the Egyptian territory occupied by Israel, Israeli engineers began digging a "final line of defense" ten miles east of the Suez Canal on the 8th. The report states that they are constructing "more permanent positions."

    以色列宣称将自埃及撤军
    但同时在运河区修筑阵地
    新华社9日讯　耶路撒冷消息：以色列总理本—古里安11月8日午夜过后不久在一篇广播讲话中宣布，以色列政府“已经决定通知联合国秘书长，以色列准备在联合国紧急部队肯定进入运河地区以后，立即撤回它在埃及境内的军队”。
    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：以色列11月8日正式宣布，它将从埃及撤退它的部队，并且要同即将派去中东的联合国警察部队合作。
    以色列驻联合国代表团已经接到以色列外交部长果尔达·梅厄夫人关于这项保证的训令。代表团宣布：“伊班大使不久就要把外交部长果尔达·梅厄关于以色列保证自埃及撤退它的部队和为了达到这个目的而同拟议中的即将派去埃及的联合国部队合作的信件转交联合国秘书长。”
    但是从以色列来的消息表明，到目前为止并没有以色列军队准备撤出埃及领土的迹象。合众社耶路撒冷消息说，为了“巩固”以色列侵占的埃及领土，以色列工兵已经在8日开始在苏伊士运河以东十英里的地方挖掘“最后防线”。消息说，他们正在修筑“比较永久的阵地”。
