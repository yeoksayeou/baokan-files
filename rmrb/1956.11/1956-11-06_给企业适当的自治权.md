Giving Enterprises Appropriate Autonomy
Zhang Shihong

In his "Political Report to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China," Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out that higher-level state organs should change the phenomenon of excessive and rigid control over enterprises. This phenomenon has hindered the due initiative and flexibility of enterprises, causing undue losses to their work.

The facts completely correspond to the situation pointed out by Comrade Liu Shaoqi. Currently, the demand for granting enterprises appropriate autonomy has become an increasingly common and urgent request from responsible cadres in various enterprises.

In Shanghai, the heads of some state-owned factories and joint state-private enterprises often say that due to the excessive and rigid control of higher-level state organs in areas such as planning management, financial management, cadre management, employee deployment, and welfare facilities, they cannot do many things and cannot manage them, only playing the role of "abacus beads." They cannot manage, but as heads of enterprises, they have to manage, which cannot but make them feel troubled.

At present, the general manager of a state-owned factory has only about 200 to 500 yuan of flexibility in finance (depending on the size and nature of the factory); joint state-private enterprises have even less, and some new joint ventures have no financial power at all, even buying a bar of soap has to be approved by the higher-level specialized company. A factory always inevitably has some expenditures outside the budget, and many expenditures will always exceed 500 yuan or 200 yuan. Once this figure is exceeded, countless troubles follow. For example, Shanghai experienced high temperatures this summer, and the State Council instructed factories in the south to have cooling equipment in all high-temperature workshops. Many joint state-private enterprises did not have cooling equipment, and installing cooling equipment would cost money, and it would always exceed 200 yuan. So they reported to the higher-level specialized company, and after repeated delays in official correspondence, not to mention the delay, the strange thing is that many specialized companies still handled such urgent matters according to the "old rules." For example, the labor protection department of one specialized company agreed to the factory purchasing cooling equipment, but the finance department did not approve it, saying that according to "regulations," this money was not in the third-quarter plan and would be allocated to the factory after the budget was made in the fourth quarter. The administration and trade union of the Shanghai Jiejing Glass Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, had dealt with the affiliated specialized company eleven times to solve the problem of cooling equipment, and it was not resolved until the newspaper criticized the matter. But at this time, the weather had already cooled down. Excessive control over financial management also hinders enterprises from improving production technology in a timely manner. After some enterprises accept a certain order, workers put forward some valuable rationalization proposals in order to ensure the completion or early completion of the task, but the trial and implementation of these proposals costs money, and the factory cannot make decisions. For the factory, several hundred yuan is an important matter, but once it reaches the higher-level organs, it may not be taken seriously, and it often takes a month or two to get approval for the expenditure. By this time, the order is almost completed, and the significance of the rationalization proposal is not great. Situations like the above cannot but arouse the dissatisfaction of the workers and frustrate their enthusiasm for production.

The situation is the same in finance as it is in employee deployment and cadre management. The factory does not have the flexibility to transfer labor. In the same urban area, one factory has a surplus of labor and another factory has a shortage of labor, but they cannot transfer a person on their own. In personnel management, some state-owned factories have to report the transfer of a section-level cadre not only to the municipal-level organs for approval, but also to the central organs for approval, which puts the factory in a very passive position in terms of cadre transfer.

Higher-level organs should manage important matters, and even some trivial matters that can be completely ignored must also be managed. Opening a skylight in the factory, opening an emergency exit, and building a toilet must be reported for approval, often after several twists and turns, and the result is still not approved. The Shanghai Lixing Thermos Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, dealt with the affiliated company for more than a year in order to build a simple toilet, and it was finally resolved after the factory's party organization issued an appeal to the municipal party committee, the district party committee, and the Light Industry Bureau.

If higher-level organs over-centralize power and take on everything, can they manage well? Facts have proved that not only can they not manage well, but they also cannot manage at all. Rigid and excessive systems not only hinder the initiative and flexibility of enterprises, but also bind the hands and feet of higher-level organs themselves. Some enterprises propose solutions to problems, and higher-level organs know that they are good, but do not support them, and they cannot come up with solutions themselves. As a result, leadership becomes an obstacle to solving practical problems. Consider the following facts: During the high heat this summer, many joint state-private enterprises in Shanghai could not buy materials for cooling equipment (such as motors, fans, blowers, etc.). They reported to the affiliated specialized companies, but the specialized companies also had no way. However, after the Industry Section of the Changning District People's Committee conducted a survey, it found that some other joint state-private enterprises in the district had some surplus motors and fans that were not in use. Obviously, if the factories in the entire district could allocate them to each other, the problem could be solved. But it was not possible. The District People's Committee did not have such power, so they asked the specialized companies for instructions, requesting the specialized companies to allow the factories in the district to allocate to each other. However, according to the regulations, the materials of each specialized company can only be allocated within the factories affiliated to the company, so each specialized company cannot make decisions. So they asked the leading organs of these companies, the Municipal Light Industry Bureau and the Heavy Industry Bureau, for instructions, but the reply from these bureaus was: Although this method is good, it cannot be done because there cannot be allocation relationships between factories in different bureaus. So they went to the Third and Fourth Offices of the Municipal People's Committee, the leading organs of the bureaus, but the offices also said "no" for the same reason. On the one hand, the companies and bureaus are unable to solve the practical difficulties of the affiliated factories; on the other hand, they do not agree with the factories' request to solve the problem by themselves. Isn't this a contradictory phenomenon? It is indeed contradictory, but this is precisely the reality.

The fundamental way to solve this contradiction is: under the unified national policy and plan, to give factories certain flexibility and autonomy, so that they can solve the problems they can solve themselves in accordance with local conditions and in accordance with the times, and enable the factories to establish their own cooperative relationships within a certain range. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his "Political Report to the Eighth National Congress": "The leading organs of our economic departments must conscientiously manage what should be managed well, and not manage what can be ignored or should not be managed." The current situation is that higher-level organs, in order to cope with many things that can be ignored or should not be managed, have made the institutions bloated and large, resulting in the phenomenon of being fat at the top and thin at the bottom, and being top-heavy. If the management is too much and too rigid, the leading departments cannot but fall into事務主义 and 文牍主义, unable to truly go deep into the enterprises and solve the various major problems in the enterprises in a timely and concrete manner. As a result, the real leadership is relaxed, and what should be managed is not managed well. It can be seen from this that giving enterprises appropriate autonomy is not only urgently needed to improve the enterprises themselves, but also urgently needed to improve the work of the enterprise leading departments.

### 给企业适当的自治权

    给企业适当的自治权
    章世鸿
    刘少奇同志在“中国共产党中央委员会向第八次全国代表大会的政治报告”中指出，上级国家机关应该改变对于企业管得过多、过死的现象，这种现象已经妨碍了企业应有的主动性和机动性，使工作受到不应有的损失。
    事实完全符合刘少奇同志所指出的这种情况。目前，要求给企业适当的自治权已经成为各企业负责干部愈来愈普遍、愈来愈迫切的要求。
    在上海，一些国营工厂和公私合营工厂的负责人经常这样说，由于上级国家机关在计划管理、财务管理、干部管理、职工调配、福利设施等方面管得过多、过死，许多事他们做不了，管不了，只能起“算盘珠子”的作用。管不了，但作为企业的负责人又非管不可，这不能不使他们感到棘手。
    目前一般国营工厂厂长在财务方面大概只有二百元到五百元的机动权（视厂的大小、性质不同）；公私合营企业就更少，有的新合营企业根本没有财权，连买一块肥皂都要由上级专业公司来批。一个工厂总难免有些预算以外的支出，而许多支出总得超过五百元或二百元，一旦超过这个数字，数不尽的麻烦就接踵而来。例如今年夏天上海高热，国务院指示南方工厂各高温车间应有降温设备。有许多公私合营工厂没有降温设备，而要装置降温设备，就得花钱，而且总得超过二百元。于是就向上级专业公司打报告，公文往返拖延，耽搁日子这且不说，奇怪的是许多专业公司对这样火烧眉毛的事仍然按“老规矩”办事。例如，有的专业公司劳保科同意工厂购置降温设备，但财务科不批准，说根据“制度”，这笔钱在第三季度计划中没有，要工厂造了预算，第四季度才拨给。上海公私合营洁晶玻璃厂行政和工会为了解决降温设备问题同所属专业公司先后打了十一次交道，直到报纸对这件事提出了批评，才得到解决。可是这时候天气已凉快了。对财务管理控制过死，也妨碍企业及时改进生产技术。有些企业在接受某项订货任务后，工人们为了保证完成或提前完成任务，提出一些很有价值的合理化建议，但试行和实现这些建议就得花钱，厂内不能作主。对工厂来说，几百元钱是件重要的事，一到上级机关，就不一定被人重视，往往一个月两个月才得到同意开支，这时候，订货任务也快完成了，合理化建议的意义就不大。类似上面这些情况，不能不引起工人群众的不满，挫折了工人的生产积极性。
    财务上是这样，职工调配、干部管理上也是这样。工厂没有调动劳动力的机动权，同在一个市区内，这个工厂劳动力过剩，那个工厂劳动力不足，他们不能自行调动一个人。在人事管理上，有些国营工厂调动一个科长级干部，不但要呈报市级机关批，更要送到中央机关批，使厂内在干部调动方面陷于极大的被动。
    上级机关大事要管，甚至一些完全可以不管的小事也要管。厂内开一个天窗，开一个太平门，修造一个厕所都得呈报批准，往往几番周折，结果还是不准。公私合营上海立兴热水瓶厂为了修造一个简单的厕所，和所属公司打了一年多交道，最后还是由工厂党组织向市委、区委、轻工业局等发了呼吁后才得以解决。
    上级机关把权力过分集中，事无巨细一概包揽，能否管好呢？事实证明，不但管不好，而且也管不了。订得过死、过多的制度，不但妨碍了企业的主动性和机动性，而且也束缚了上级机关自己的手足。有些事企业提出了解决的办法，上级机关明知是好的，但不支持，而自己又拿不出办法，结果领导竟成为解决实际问题中的一种阻力。请看下面的事实：今年夏天高热时，上海有许多公私合营工厂买不到降温设备的材料（如马达、风扇、鼓风器等），他们向所属专业公司提出，专业公司也没有办法。但当时长宁区人民委员会工业科作了一次摸底后，即发现区内另一些公私合营工厂有一些多余不用的马达和风扇，显然，如果全区各厂相互调拨一下，问题是可以解决的。但不行。区人民委员会没有这样的权利，于是他们向各专业公司请示，要求专业公司允许区内各厂相互调拨。但按制度规定，各专业公司的物资只能在本公司所属工厂内部调拨，因此各专业公司都不能作主。于是他们又请示这些公司的领导机关市轻工业局、重工业局，但这些局的答复是：虽然这个办法是好的，但办不到，因为不同局的工厂之间不能有调拨关系。于是他们又找局的领导机关市人民委员会第三、第四办公室，办公室也以同样的理由说“不行”。一方面公司和局无力解决所属工厂的实际困难；另一方面，各工厂要求自行调拨解决又不同意，这不是矛盾的现象吗？的确是矛盾的，但这正是现实的矛盾。
    解决这个矛盾的根本办法是：在国家统一的政策、计划下，给工厂以一定的机动权力和自治权力，使他们能够因地制宜、因时制宜地解决他们本身可以解决的问题，使各工厂之间能够在一定范围内建立自己的协作关系。刘少奇同志在“八大”的政治报告中指出：“我们的经济部门的领导机关必须认真把该管的事管好，而不要去管那些可以不管或者不该管的事。”目前的情况是上级机关为了应付许多可以不管或者不该管的事，弄得机构臃肿庞大，出现了上面肥，下面瘦，头重脚轻的现象。管得过多、过死，领导部门就不能不陷于事务主义、文牍主义的忙乱中，不能真正深入企业，及时地具体地解决企业中各种重大的问题，结果是放松了真正的领导，使该管的事反而管得不好。由此可见，给企业适当的自治权力，不但是改进企业本身所迫切需要的，也是改进企业领导部门的工作所迫切需要的。
