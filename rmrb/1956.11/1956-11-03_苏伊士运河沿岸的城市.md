Cities Along the Suez Canal

	Port Said
	Port Said is the gateway to the Suez Canal, located on the Mediterranean coast at the northern entrance of the Suez Canal. Port Said was built simultaneously with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1859.

	Port Said is an excellent trading port and was once a huge naval base for the British colonial army. Its docks have a total length of fifteen kilometers and can accommodate giant seagoing vessels. Hundreds of thousands of passengers pass through this port every year. The port is equipped with coal and gasoline supply stations so that ships passing through the Suez Canal can refuel here. There are railways and highways from Port Said to Cairo, the capital of Egypt.

	The population of Port Said has grown significantly over the past half-century. In 1882, the population was 17,000; now it is about 180,000, making it the third most populous city in Egypt.

	Port Said is the headquarters of the Suez Canal Company. On the east bank of Port Said is Port Fouad, which was established in 1926. It houses the Suez Canal Company's harbors and the company's financial and commercial institutions.

	Since Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, Port Said has been managed by the Egyptian customs authorities.

	Suez
	Suez is an ancient city at the southern end of the Suez Canal, built in the seventh century. After the Ottoman Empire conquered Egypt in the sixteenth century, Suez became a naval base and commercial city. It is an important port on the Suez Canal with a population of about 100,000.

	Directly opposite Suez is Port Tawfiq, where some of the Suez Canal Company's institutions and businesses are located. There are railways and highways from Suez directly to Cairo and Port Said. British colonists used to store large quantities of fuel and munitions here. There are several airports in the surrounding area.

	Ismailia
	Ismailia is located in the middle reaches of the Suez Canal, on the west bank of Lake Timsah. It is the third largest port on the Suez Canal, with a population of about 40,000. There are railways and highways from Ismailia to Cairo, Suez, Port Said and other places.

	Ismailia was once a foreign concession occupied by the British army. The British Middle East Air Force headquarters and the Suez Canal Technical Administration were located here. There are huge air force bases, airports and other military equipment near the suburbs. There are shipbuilding docks for medium-sized vessels in the port.

	Before the British troops withdrew from the Suez Canal Zone, there used to be many entertainment venues for the British occupation forces here. In the past, in the urban area of Ismailia, the residences of foreign colonists and British occupiers had beautiful gardens, fountains, and gurgling streams; but in the low huts of the vast majority of the people, there was only hunger and poverty.

	Sinai Peninsula
	The Sinai Peninsula is located east of the Suez Canal. It is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Red Sea to the south, the Gulf of Suez to the west, and the Gulf of Aqaba to the southeast. The northeastern border of the peninsula borders Israel. The southern part of the peninsula is mountainous, with many peaks of the Sinai Mountains. The central part is a plateau with an average height of 1,000 meters. The northern part is a vast sandy dune area. Rainfall is extremely rare on the Sinai Peninsula, and the climate in the southwest of the peninsula is very dry.

	The peninsula has a variety of minerals. Known minerals include oil, manganese, copper, gemstones, and iron ore.

	According to the 1947 statistics, the peninsula has a population of 38,000, most of whom live in the northwest. The average population density on the peninsula is only 0.7 people per square kilometer.

	There is a railway on the peninsula from Kantara on the Suez Canal to the border of Palestine.

    苏伊士运河沿岸的城市
    塞得港
    塞得港是苏伊士运河的咽喉，位于地中海沿岸和苏伊士运河的北口。在苏伊士运河于1859年开凿的同时，塞得港也就建成了。
    塞得港是一个优良的贸易港，曾经是英国殖民军的一个巨大的海军据点。它的码头的总长度有十五公里，可以容纳巨型的海轮。每年有几十万旅客经过这个港口。港口内设有一些煤和汽油的供应站，以便通过苏伊士运河的船只在这里添加燃料。从塞得港有铁路和公路通往埃及首都开罗。
    塞得港的人口半个多世纪以来有显著的增长。1882年人口为一万七千人；而现在已有人口十八万左右，成为埃及第三个人口最多的大城市。
    塞得港是苏伊士运河公司的所在地。在塞得港的东岸有福德港，它是在1926年建立的。这里有属于苏伊士运河公司的港湾，以及公司的财务和商业机构。
    自埃及宣布苏伊士运河公司国有化以后，塞得港已由埃及的海关当局负责管理。
    苏伊士
    苏伊士是苏伊士运河南端的一个古老的城市，建于第七世纪。十六世纪鄂图曼帝国征服埃及以后，苏伊士就变成了海军基地和商业城市。这是苏伊士运河的一个重要港口，居民约有十万人。
    在苏伊士的斜对岸是托菲克港，苏伊士运河公司的一些机构和企业就设在这里。从苏伊士有铁路和公路直通开罗和塞得港。英国殖民者曾经在这里储藏有大量燃料、军火。周围有好几个飞机场。
    伊士美利亚
    伊士美利亚位于苏伊士运河中游，提姆萨湖的西岸。它是苏伊士运河的第三大港。人口约四万。从伊士美利亚有铁路和公路通向开罗、苏伊士和塞得港等地。
    伊士美利亚曾经是英军占领的外国租借地，英国在中近东地区的空军司令部和苏伊士运河技术管理处都设在这里。城郊附近有巨大的空军基地、飞机场以及其它的军事设备。在港口上有中型船只的造船台。 
    在英国军队撤出苏伊士运河区以前，这里曾经有过许多英国占领军的娱乐场所。过去，在伊士美利亚的市区内，外国殖民者和英国占领者的住宅里有着美丽的花园、喷水泉和潺潺的小溪；但在广大人民低矮的小屋里只有饥饿和穷困。
    西奈半岛
    西奈半岛位于苏伊士运河以东。北靠地中海，南临红海，西面是苏伊士湾，东南面是阿喀巴湾。半岛的东北边境同以色列毗邻。半岛的南部是山区，磐踞着西奈山脉的许多高峰。中部是平均高度为一千公尺的高原。北部是广袤的砂丘地带。西奈半岛上雨量极少，在半岛的西南部气候非常干燥。
    半岛上有多种矿产。已知的有石油、锰、铜、宝石和铁矿苗等。
    半岛上居民据1947年统计是三万八千人，他们多集居于西北部。半岛上平均人口的密度是一平方公里只有0.7人。
    半岛上有铁路从苏伊士运河上的堪塔拉通到巴勒斯坦的边境。
