    Is Running a Newspaper Just Preparing to Waste?
    The "Anhui Culture News," published by the Anhui Culture Bureau, has a circulation of only five to six thousand copies per issue. In order to expand publicity, the editorial department prints many more copies each time: more than 32,000 extra copies in June, more than 3,000 extra copies in July, and more than 4,000 extra copies in August. Some of these extra copies are taken to the countryside for retail, while others are piled up at home gathering dust. In order to save paper, we have suggested reducing the print run several times. However, the person in charge of the editorial department said, "Running a newspaper is just preparing to waste." Up to now, more than 1,000 extra copies are still printed each issue.
    The leaders of the Anhui Provincial Culture Bureau are aware of the tight paper supply situation. They control the use of paper by other units very strictly, even prohibiting the random use of cut-off "scraps." But we don't understand why they don't care about the waste of paper by their own affiliated units? Could it be that they also think, "Running a newspaper is just preparing to waste"?

### 办报就是准备浪费的？

    办报就是准备浪费的？
    安徽文化局出版的“安徽文化报”，每期发行只有五、六千份。编辑部为了扩大宣传每次都多印很多份报纸：6月份多印三万二千多份，7月份多印三千多份，8月份多印四千多份。这些多印的报纸，一部分拉到农村去零售，另一部分则堆在家里积灰尘。为了节约纸张，我们曾几次建议少印一些。但编辑部负责同志说：“办报就是准备浪费的。”直到现在，每期还多印一千多份。
    纸张供应紧张情况，安徽省文化局的领导上是知道的。他们对别的单位的用纸控制得很严，甚至连裁下的“破片”也不准乱用。但我们不明白他们为什么对自己所属单位的浪费纸张不加过问？莫非他们也认为：“办报就是准备浪费的”？
