    Banners and Drums
    Ping Xin
    In the clear days of the great advance of science and art, the sight of various banners flying and drums beating on all sides is a new scene that inspires and boosts morale. China's magnificent socialist cultural construction requires activating all positive factors and advocating various creative spirits; therefore, it not only allows competition for novelty and excellence but also provides a broad front for scientific and artistic troops of various designations: if it is a banner, it can fly; if it is a drum, it can sound. It is not difficult to imagine that when the order for the great advance of science and art was first issued, in addition to cloud banners, tiger banners, luan banners, falcon banners... and thunder drums, whale drums, kui drums, tuo drums... which are sufficient to boost the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend, Hundred Flowers Bloom," there must also be feather "banners" and frog "drums" secretly opposing "contention" and "bloom." On this point, I very much agree with what Mr. Shu Wu said: "Will dogmatism thus willingly retreat, fold its banners, and silence its drums? No, no, absolutely not." (Shu Wu's "Struggling Just Treat it as Struggling" in "Wenhui Daily" "Pen Club" on October 22)
    But perhaps because Mr. Shu Wu was too eager for battle and exerted too much force, in the process of wielding his battle-axe in one go, he forgot that the battle between the side that advocates the spirit of creation and independent thinking and the other side that stubbornly clings to dogmas and guards its own interests is not as clearly divided as a ball game or a boxing match; rather, the battle lines between them are intertwined; those who superficially support the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend, Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy but secretly cling to dogmas can take their distorted Marxism-Leninism as a battle "banner" for continued resistance, and take their imagined politics as a war "drum" for opportunistic counterattacks; while the warriors who sincerely want to fight for this policy can also shout "Hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism," and shout "Art workers must not forget politics," this kind of shouting is also an indispensable sound. If, without distinguishing between right and wrong, both of the above two different kinds of "banners and drums" are regarded as "the struggle and counterattack of dogmatism" ("Struggling Just Treat it as Struggling"), and the battle-axe is wielded wildly, it is naturally enjoyable, but once the goal of the battle is disrupted, the results of the battle are very questionable.
    Of course, such a great wielding of the battle-axe is by no means enough to mistakenly injure the warriors who are truly greatly unfurling the banner of Marxism-Leninism, because they are by no means a disorganized rabble who cannot withstand a single chop; but it is obviously not enough to damage even a bit of the skin of the dogmatists, because after a period of confusion, they are happy to hide behind the anti-dogmatic Marxists and remain unscathed. What makes people uneasy is some spectators who lack the ability to judge, and who may unintentionally eat the random axes of the brave Li Kui, who is eager to contend, in their thinking.
    Since the Party issued the call for "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend, Hundred Flowers Bloom," among the tens of millions of intellectuals, I was one who burst out with cheers from the bottom of my heart. But I have never opened my mouth or written a word for this unprecedented happy event concerning the century-old plan of culture, because I think the important thing is to prepare to contend, prepare to bloom. Since all sides are singing praises and cheering, the absence of my little song will in no way detract from the vastness of the sea of music. Today, after reading Mr. Shu Wu's "Struggling Just Treat it as Struggling," I can't help but hum a few tunes.
    Mobilizing all scientific and artistic forces to serve the socialist construction of the motherland for a long time should be the general direction of "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend, Hundred Flowers Bloom," and to march in this direction for a long time, the leadership of Marxism-Leninism is absolutely indispensable. Direction and leadership not only do not hinder "contention" and "bloom," but also promote intellectual, scientific, and artistic richness, diversity, and liveliness, and encourage people to展开 debates on different opinions and competitions of different styles. Even on the Marxist-Leninist front, various banners can be flown and various war drums can be sounded. No one is qualified to say that under a unified worldview and historical view, only one family, one sect, one faction is allowed to monopolize everything forever, and that on any issue and in any labor, only one formula, one conclusion, one style is allowed to monopolize everything forever. Similarly, no one is qualified to say that non-Marxist-Leninist schools have no right to speak and create in socialist territory; the thoughts, doctrines, arts, and politics of various parties, factions, families, and sects have different depths of relationship, but they have their own boundaries and have no reason to be mixed into one.
    Marxism, which has been repeatedly verified by countless historical facts for more than a hundred years, is like an all-encompassing universe, it can accommodate countless clusters, constellations and nebulae, it can allow every star and every star cluster to freely emit light, and it is not afraid of any variable stars and comets disturbing its harmony. Therefore, we do not need to worry that greatly unfurling the banner of Marxism-Leninism will block the broad road of "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend, Hundred Flowers Bloom," and scare away many intellectuals who want to "contend" and are waiting to "bloom." The only question is to open the socialist ideological front, scientific construction site, and art garden to all citizens, and let every scientific team and artistic team, every scientific warrior and artistic warrior, sing bravely and fight vigorously for the motherland and mankind.
    Let us hold the banner of Marxism-Leninism even higher, and let us beat the drums of socialism even louder.
    October 22, 1956, in Shanghai

    旗鼓
    平心
    在科学和艺术大进军的晴朗日子里，各色旗帜竞飞，各方鼓鼙齐鸣，乃是振奋人心鼓舞士气的新景象。我国极其宏伟的社会主义文化建设，需要活跃一切积极因素，倡导各种创造精神；因此不但容许争奇斗胜，而且要为各个不同番号的科学部队和艺术部队供给广阔的阵地：是旗就可以飘，是鼓就可以响。不难设想，当着科学与艺术大进军的号令初次发出的时候，除了出现足为“百家争鸣，百花齐放”助威增色的云旗、虎旗、鸾旗、隼旗……和雷鼓、鲸鼓、夔鼓、鼍鼓……而外，也一定会有暗中反对“争鸣”、“齐放”的羽“旗”与蛙“鼓”。在这一点上，我很同意舒芜先生所说的：“教条主义就这样自甘退让，掩旗息鼓而去么？不会，不会，断然不会”。（10月22日“文汇报”“笔会”舒芜作“挣扎只当他挣扎”）
    但是也许由于舒芜先生求战过急，用力过猛，在一鼓作气大抡板斧的当儿，忘记了崇尚创造精神提倡独立思考的一方，跟死啃教条株守门户的另一方交战，并不像赛球斗拳那样壁垒分明，他们彼此间的战线宁可说是犬牙交错的；表面上拥护“百家争鸣，百花齐放”方针而内心抱住教条不放的分子，可以拿他们所曲解的马克思列宁主义作为继续顽抗的战“旗”，拿他们所臆想的政治作为伺隙反攻的军“鼓”；而诚心愿意为这方针奋斗的战士们，也可以大喊“高举马克思列宁主义旗帜”，大喊“艺术工作者不能忘记政治”，这一类的呐喊也就是一种不可缺少的鸣声。若果不分皂白，把上面两种不同性质的“旗鼓”一律看做“教条主义的挣扎和反攻”（“挣扎只当他挣扎”），抡起板斧乱砍，痛快自然是痛快，而战斗的目标一经搅乱，战果也就很可怀疑了。
    当然，这样的大挥板斧，绝不足以误伤真正大张马克思列宁主义旗鼓的战士，因为他们决不是那样经不起一砍的乌合之众；但显然也不足以损及教条主义者的一片皮肉，因为经过一番淆混，他们正乐得躲在反教条主义的马克思主义者的背后，安然无恙。使人放不下心的，倒是一些缺乏判断能力的观战者，他们在思想上很可能无意中吃到勇于争鸣的李逵的乱斧。
    自从党发出“百家争鸣，百花齐放”的号召以后，在千千万万的知识分子中，我是从心底里迸出欢呼声的一个。但我不曾为这件有关文化百年大计的空前喜事开过一次口，写过一个字，因为我认为要紧的是准备鸣，准备放。既然四面八方都在高歌颂赞，欢声动地，少了我的一声小唱，决无损于乐海的泱漭。今天读了舒芜先生的“挣扎只当他挣扎”，却忍不住要哼几声。
    动员一切科学和艺术的力量，为祖国的社会主义建设长期服务，这应该是“百家争鸣，百花齐放”的总方向，而要朝这个方向长征，万万少不得马克思列宁主义的领导。方向与领导非但决不妨碍“争鸣”与“齐放”，而且会提倡思想上、科学上和艺术上的丰富多采与活泼清新，鼓励人们展开不同意见的争辩和不同风格的竞赛。即如在马克思列宁主义阵地上，就可以飘起各家旗帜，敲起各家战鼓。谁也没有资格说，在统一的世界观与历史观之下，永远只容许一家、一宗、一派专断一切，在任何问题任何劳作上，永远只容许一个公式、一个结论、一个风格包办一切。同样，谁也没有资格说，非马克思列宁主义的流派在社会主义国土里没有发言权和创作权，各党、各派、各家、各宗的思想、学说、艺术和政治都有深浅不同的关系，但彼此各有分野，它们绝无混同为一的理由。
    经过一百多年无量历史事实反复证验的马克思主义，正像一个无所不包的宇宙，它容得下无数的星团、星座和星云，可以让每颗星星和每个星群自由发光，而决不害怕任何变星和慧星扰乱它的和谐。因此，我们正不必顾虑大张马克思列宁主义的旗鼓，就会阻塞“百家争鸣，百花齐放”的康庄大道，吓跑了许多欲“鸣”待
  “放”的知识分子。问题只在于让社会主义的思想阵地、科学工地和艺术园地向一切公民开放，让每一个科学队伍和艺术队伍、每一个科学战士和艺术战士为了祖国和人类，勇敢地歌唱，活泼地战斗。
    让我们把马克思列宁主义的旗帜举得更高些，让我们把社会主义的战鼓敲得更响些。　1956年10月22日于上海
