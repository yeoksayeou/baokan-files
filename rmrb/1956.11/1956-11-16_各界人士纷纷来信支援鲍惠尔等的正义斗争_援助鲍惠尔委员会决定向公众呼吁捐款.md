    This Newspaper Reports: The former editor of the Shanghai *Millard's Review*, Powell, and others, have been persecuted by the US government for exposing the US policy of aggression against China and Korea. After relevant articles and commentaries on this event were published in newspapers and magazines in various places, it has attracted widespread attention and close concern. People have written letters expressing great indignation at the US reactionary authorities' attempt to carry out fascist persecution of Powell and others; expressing warm sympathy and support for these three American journalists who love truth and uphold the just struggle. Some people are also willing to help financially and have already sent donations for Powell and others to use for legal defense in the United States. Some of the letter writers are former readers of *Millard's Review*, and more are people from all walks of life who are indignant at the US government's persecution of Powell and others. A worker couple wrote in a letter that in addition to protesting to the US authorities who persecuted Powell and others, they will donate a portion of their labor competition bonus, which they had just received, to Powell and others to express their sentiments. A student from Tsinghua University in Beijing wrote in a letter that he believes the US authorities' unreasonable persecution of Powell and others is bound to be shattered by the facts, and he specially donated a sum of money as a sign of support for the struggle of Powell and others. Another couple who had studied in the United States and have now returned to New China wrote in a letter that they wanted to donate some money for the Powell-Schuman case, which was originally a gift from their American friends to their young daughter. They believe that donating this gift to the three brave American journalists who are fighting for the truth for their defense is more beneficial.
    It is reported that the Committee to Aid Powell and Others has also raised a sum of money among the members first and has sent it to Powell and others for their defense in the US court. Now, encouraged by the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life and the leading donations of the committee members, the committee has decided to widely appeal to the public for donations, and hopes that donors will send this donation directly to Mr. Lu Yi Ai Li, Chairman of the Committee, Room 251, Beijing Hotel, or to the Shanghai *Wenhui Daily* for collection.

    各界人士纷纷来信支援鲍惠尔等的正义斗争
    援助鲍惠尔委员会决定向公众呼吁捐款
    本报讯　前上海密勒氏评论报编辑鲍惠尔等，由于揭露了美国对中国和朝鲜的侵略政策而遭到美国政府的迫害。这一事件由各地的报纸杂志刊载了有关的文章和评论以后，已经引起了人们的广泛注视和密切的关怀。人们纷纷来信，对于企图对鲍惠尔等进行法西斯迫害的美国反动当局，表示极大的愤懑；对于热爱真理和坚持正义斗争的这三位美国新闻工作者，表示热烈的同情和支援。有些人还愿意解囊相助，并已经送来了捐款，以供鲍惠尔等在美国进行法律辩护之用。这些来信的人，有些是前密勒氏评论报的读者，更多的是对美国政府迫害鲍惠尔等的案件激于义愤的各界人士。有一对工人夫妇来信说，他们除了向迫害鲍惠尔等的美国当局提出抗议外，并将他们自己刚领到的一笔劳动竞赛奖金，捐赠一部分给鲍惠尔等，以表心意。北京清华大学一个学生来信说，他相信美国当局无理迫害鲍惠尔等的阴谋，一定会被事实所粉碎，他特地捐赠了一笔钱，作为支持鲍惠尔等三人进行斗争的表示。还有一对曾在美国留学现已回到新中国的夫妇来信说，他们要为鲍惠尔、舒曼案件捐一些钱，这些钱本来是他们的美国朋友赠送给他们的小女儿的，他们认为把这个礼物捐给正在为真理而奋斗的三位勇敢的美国新闻工作者，以供其辩护之用，更有益处。
    据悉，援助鲍惠尔等委员会也已经在委员当中先筹集了一笔钱，并已送交鲍惠尔等以供其在美国法院作辩护之用。该委员会现在因为受到各界人士的热心支援和委员们的带头捐助的鼓舞，决定向公众广泛呼吁捐款，并希望捐款人今后将此项捐款直接寄交北京饭店二五一号该委员会主席路易·艾黎先生，或寄交上海文汇报代收亦可。
