Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 15th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company’s product costs in October were 2.37 million yuan lower than the state plan; 18.02% lower than the average actual product cost per month last year. This is the month with the lowest product costs for Anshan Iron and Steel.

In the first half of the year, Anshan Iron and Steel’s product costs had exceeded the budget month by month. Starting in July, the factories and mines implemented economic accounting systems and conservation measures, which reversed the situation of cost overruns. The seamless steel pipe plant carried out conservation movements such as the utilization of waste materials, saving the country 330,000 yuan in wealth from July to October. The improvement in Anshan Iron and Steel's production situation after July is also the main reason for the monthly decline in costs. In October, the rolling mills increased production by more than 40,000 tons of steel billets and steel, reducing product costs by 940,000 yuan. Production generally increased in the mines, and costs were also reduced. The Dashiqiao Magnesite Mine alone reduced costs by 110,000 yuan in October. In terms of raw material consumption, the primary rolling mill used 3,500 tons less steel in rolling steel billets in October, and the iron-smelting plant also saved a large amount of ore and coke.

    鞍钢十月份降低成本二百多万元
    新华社鞍山15日电　鞍山钢铁公司十月份产品成本比国家计划降低了二百三十七万元；比去年每月平均的实际产品成本降低了18.02％。这是鞍钢产品成本最低的一个月。
    在上半年，鞍钢产品成本曾经逐月超支，从7月开始，各厂矿贯彻经济核算制度和节约措施，才扭转了成本超支的局面。无缝钢管厂开展利用废料等节约运动，从7月到10月为国家节约了三十三万元的财富。7月份以后鞍钢生产情况好转，也是成本逐月下降的主要原因。10月份各轧钢厂增产了四万多吨钢坯和钢材，使产品成本降低了九十四万元。各矿山普遍增产，成本也都有降低，仅是大石桥镁矿一个单位，在10月份就降低成本十一万元。在原材料消耗方面，10月份初轧厂轧制钢坯少用了三千五百多吨钢，炼铁厂也节约了大量矿石和焦炭。
