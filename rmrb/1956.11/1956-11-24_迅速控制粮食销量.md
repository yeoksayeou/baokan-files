    Rapidly Control Grain Sales

    With the development of national economic construction, the living standards of urban and rural residents should correspondingly improve. This requires a constant and appropriate increase in the supply of grain. However, China is a large country with a population of 600 million, and increasing the grain supply for 600 million people is not a simple matter. For a considerable period, the situation of insufficient grain production will still exist. If grain supply is not strictly and systematically controlled, if the objectively large increase in grain demand is not appropriately restrained, billions of jin of grain could be sold unconsciously with the slightest relaxation.

    Since the summer of this year, many comrades have neglected this basic situation and relaxed their vigilance on the grain issue, resulting in an unreasonable increase in national grain sales. The grain sales volume in the four months from July to October this year increased by billions of jin compared to the same period last year; the grain sales volume in the first half of November this year increased by hundreds of millions of jin compared to the same period last year. Because the actual sales volume in the first five months greatly exceeded the plan, the sales targets for the seven months from December this year to June next year are already lower than the actual sales volume in the same period of the previous year. If the grain sales volume in these seven months continues to increase compared to the same period last year, the problem will become serious.

    When the state formulated this year's grain purchase and sales plan, it fully considered and appropriately accommodated the reasonable factors for increasing grain sales in various aspects. The state plan for grain requisition this year is less than the previous year, while the grain sold is more than the previous year. Under the current circumstances of relatively low levels of industrial and agricultural production in our country, the state has indeed made the greatest efforts to increase grain supply to urban and rural residents. A considerable portion of the aforementioned over-sales is reasonable and is what the state planned to sell more of. For example, to support disaster-stricken people in production and overcoming famine, to develop certain needed sideline occupations that are important to the national economy and the people's livelihood, to meet the needs of reasonably increasing urban populations, and to appropriately raise unreasonable supply standards, etc.

    However, a large portion of the aforementioned over-sales is also unreasonable. This is mainly reflected in: the grain ration standards for urban residents were generally too tight at the beginning, but after several adjustments, they are now generally too loose. According to investigations, the average grain ration in many cities and towns is now three to four jin higher than the original standard. The rural grain supply situation is also abnormal. In areas where grain sales could be stopped after the autumn harvest, the supply was not stopped in a timely manner. Some places still have the phenomenon of issuing grain purchase slips casually. Some agricultural production cooperatives, in order to increase income, use the cooperative's grain to open restaurants, and then ask the state for supplies. The standards for grain consumption in the cooked food industry in large and medium-sized cities are too broad, and many places have in fact abandoned planned control. The practice of rural residents entering cities to obtain grain with grain coupons has fallen into a state of laissez-faire in many places; in particular, the method of differential subsidies for temporary migrant workers has been discontinued in many places.

    The facts fully prove that now, whether in cities or rural areas, whether in industries or among residents, grain supply is generally too loose. In order to curb the development of this phenomenon, the Party and government leading organs in cities and rural areas must immediately take necessary and appropriate measures, in accordance with the "Instructions on Current Grain Work" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on November 21, to compress unreasonable grain sales. Generally speaking, large and medium-sized cities should tighten control even more. Cities and towns are places that consume a lot of grain. In these places, not only should the unreasonable portions of residents' grain rations be compressed, but it should also be stipulated that migrant workers participating in national economic construction and national defense construction must continue to bring grain coupons to obtain grain, and the portion of their actual grain consumption that is insufficient should be subsidized by the state. Grain consumption by industries should be compressed, and control should be exercised according to a standard that is slightly looser than the supply volume in 1954-1955 but slightly tighter than the current supply volume.

    In terms of unified grain sales in rural areas, the method of supplying grain according to fixed sales quantities with vouchers should be strictly implemented. In general, grain should not be supplied to grain-producing areas that have not suffered disasters this year before February next year, unless there is an actual need. Grain-deficient households in rural areas should receive supplies, but the principle of eating one's own grain first and then the state's grain, and supplying grain when there is a shortage, must continue to be implemented. People's committees at all levels should formulate and issue grain supply targets level by level on a quarterly and monthly basis, and strictly control grain sales. Agricultural production cooperatives should become models for implementing the state's grain policy. When distributing grain, they should abide by the following principles: first, ensure the completion of the state-approved requisition tasks (including the increased purchase of increased production), and ensure that the state-approved supply targets are not exceeded; reserve the necessary seeds, the basic rations for all members and their families, and the necessary feed; then appropriately take care of members with strong labor power, more workdays, and large consumption; if there is surplus grain, it should be used to develop sideline production. Agricultural production cooperatives operating sideline production with grain as raw materials cannot use members' rations and seeds. In order to arrange unified grain sales and unified grain purchase at the same time, and combine them for implementation, the unified sales figures should be verified to the cooperative, arranged to the household, and obtained the consent and recognition of the cooperative and the grain-deficient households, and then the grain supply certificate should be issued.

    As long as all localities earnestly do the above-mentioned work, the situation of grain sales will quickly tend to be reasonable. The leading organs in many places have already begun to grasp the leadership of unified grain sales work, which is very necessary. We hope that all localities across the country will act quickly in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on November 21.

### 迅速控制粮食销量

    迅速控制粮食销量
    随着国家经济建设的发展，城乡居民的生活水平应该相应地提高。这就必须不断地适当地增加粮食的供应量。但是，我国是一个有六亿人口的大国，要对六亿人口增加粮食的供应量不是一件简单的事。在一个相当长的时间内，粮食生产不足的情况仍然会存在。如果对粮食供应不加以严格的、有计划的控制，如果对客观上大量增加的粮食需要不加以适当的节制，只要手头略微一松，几十亿斤粮食就可能不知不觉地销售出去。
    今年入夏以来，许多同志忽视了这个基本情况，对粮食问题放松了警惕，全国粮食销售量已经不合理地增加了。今年7月至10月四个月的粮食销售量，比去年同期增加了几十亿斤；今年11月上半月的粮食销售量，比去年同期增加了几亿斤。由于前五个月的实销量突破计划很多，今年12月到明年6月这七个月的销售指标，已比上年度同期的实销量少。如果这七个月的粮食销售量比去年同期继续增加，那末，问题就会严重起来。
    国家制定本年度粮食购销计划的时候，曾经充分地注意到和适当地照顾了各个方面增加粮食销量的合理因素。本年度国家计划征购的粮食比上年度为少，而销售的粮食却比上年度多。在我国目前工农业生产水平都还较低的情况下，国家为了对城乡居民增加粮食供应，确实尽了最大的努力。前面说的多销的粮食，其中就有相当一部分是合理的，是国家在计划中要多销的。比如，为了支援灾区人民生产渡荒，发展某些国计民生所需要的副业，满足城市合理增加的人口的需要，适当提高不合理的供应标准等等。
    但是，前面说的多销的粮食，也有很大一部分是不合理的。这主要表现在：市镇居民口粮定量标准在开始的时候一般偏紧，经过几次调整以后，现在又是一般偏松。据调查，许多市镇现在的口粮平均定量要比原定标准多三至四斤。农村粮食供应情况也不正常，在秋收后可以不出售粮食的地方，并没有及时停止供应。有些地方仍然有随便开条购粮的现象。有些农业生产合作社为了增加收入，用社里的粮食开设饭店，回头又向国家要求供应。大、中城市熟食行业用粮的标准过宽，不少地方事实上已经放弃了计划控制。农村进城人口带粮票领粮就食的办法，在不少地方已经陷于自流；特别是临时民工差额补贴的办法，在不少地方已经停止实行。
    事实充分证明，现在不论城市、农村，不论行业、居民，在粮食供应方面，一般都是偏松了。为了制止这种现象的发展，城市、农村的党政领导机关，必须按照中共中央和国务院在11月21日发布的“关于当前粮食工作的指示”，立即采取必要和适当的办法，把不合理的粮食销量压缩下来。一般地说，大、中城市应该抓的更紧一点。城镇是消耗粮食很多的地方，在这些地方不仅应该压缩居民口粮中不合理的部分，而且应该规定，参加国家经济建设和国防建设的民工，必须继续带粮票领粮就食，他们实际用粮不足的部分应由国家补助。行业用粮应该压缩，大致可以按照比1954至1955年度的供应量略宽，比目前的供应量略紧一些的标准，来加以控制。
    在农村粮食统销方面，应该严格实行按定销数量凭证供应的办法。凡是今年没有受灾的产粮区，在明年2月以前，如非实际需要，一般地不要供应粮食。农村中的缺粮户应该得到供应，但是必须继续贯彻执行先吃自己的后吃国家的、什么时候缺粮什么时候供应的原则。各级人民委员会有必要按季按月层层制定和下达粮食供应指标，严格控制粮食销量。农业生产合作社应该成为执行国家粮食政策的模范。它在分配粮食的时候，应该遵守下列原则：首先保证完成国家核定的征购任务（包括增产部分的增购任务），保证不突破国家核定的供应指标；留下社内必需的种籽、全体社员及其家属的基本口粮和必要的饲料；然后适当地照顾劳动力强、出工多、消费量大的社员；如果还有余粮，就用来发展副业生产。农业生产合作社经营以粮食为原料的副业生产，不能动用社员的口粮和种籽。为了使粮食统销和粮食统购同时安排，结合进行，应该把统销数字核定到社，安排到户，并且取得合作社和缺粮户的同意和认可，然后发给粮食供应证。
    只要各地认真做好上面所说的各项工作，粮食销售的情况就会很快地趋于合理。现在许多地方的领导机关已经开始抓紧对粮食统销工作的领导，这是非常必要的。我们希望全国一切地方都按照中共中央和国务院11月21日的指示，迅速地行动起来。
