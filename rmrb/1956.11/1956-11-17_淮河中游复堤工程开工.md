Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, November 15th. The post-flood embankment reconstruction project and riprap revetment project in the middle reaches of the Huai River have started successively. The total earthwork for these projects is 30 million cubic meters, and the amount of sand and gravel is 1.35 million cubic meters. More than half of the project tasks are to be completed this winter. Currently, 20,000 stonemasons are quarrying stones in six stone fields along the Huai River, and 180,000 laborers are starting work in succession.

This year, the main tributaries of the Huai River and parts of the main stream's embankments suffered relatively severe damage from floods and typhoons during the flood season. The total length of the embankment sections that need to be repaired is nearly 2,000 li, and these embankments need to be heightened and thickened. The Huai River Management Committee decided to raise the embankments of the Ying River (the largest tributary of the Huai River) by one meter above Fuyang and one and a half meters below Fuyang; the embankments of other rivers will be raised according to specific circumstances. Some important sections of the Huaibei Dam will also be built with permanent riprap revetment projects to enhance their wave resistance during the flood season. The total length of this project reaches more than 270 li. In addition to the main embankment sections of each river, general flood discharge embankments are also planned to be raised by about one meter. Individual flood discharge embankments, taking into account the needs of establishing irrigation projects, have also been decided to be raised by five or six chi and converted into guaranteed embankment sections. After the completion of the above projects, the flood control capacity of these embankment sections can be greatly enhanced.

    淮河中游复堤工程开工
    新华社蚌埠15日电　淮河中游的汛后复堤工程和块石护坡工程已经陆续开工。这些工程的总土方数是三千万公方，沙卵石一百三十五万公方。今年冬季要完成工程任务的一半以上。目前，有两万石工正在沿淮河的六个石场开采块石，有十八万民工正在陆续上工。
    淮河各主要支流及干流部分堤防，今年在汛期遭受洪水台风的侵袭，受损比较严重。需要修复的堤段总长近两千里，这些堤防都要加高培厚。治淮委员会决定把颖河（这是淮河最大的支流）的堤防，在阜阳以上加高一公尺，阜阳以下加高一公尺半；其他河道堤防将根据具体情况加高。淮北大堤一些重要堤段，为了增强汛期的防浪能力，也都将修筑永久性的块石护坡工程，这一工程的总长度达二百七十多里。除了各河道的主要堤段外，一般行洪堤也都准备加高一公尺左右。个别的行洪堤，由于考虑到建立灌溉工程的需要，还决定加高五六尺改为确保堤段。以上工程完成后，可以使这些堤段的防洪能力大大增强。
