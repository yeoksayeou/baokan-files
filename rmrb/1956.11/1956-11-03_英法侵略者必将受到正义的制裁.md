Editor's Note: The news of the British and French launching a war of aggression against Egypt has aroused great indignation among the people of our country. On November 1st and 2nd, our newspaper received hundreds of letters from readers in the capital, protesting against the aggressive acts of Britain and France and expressing sympathy and support for the just struggle of the Egyptian people. Some of the letters are published below:

    The Anger of Youth of All Nationalities
    We, the youth of all nationalities, have finished reading with indignation the news published in the newspaper about the Israeli and Anglo-French imperialist aggression against Egypt, and we can no longer suppress the anger in our hearts. We, the youth of all nationalities in China, love peace and independence, and we resolutely oppose the evil actions of imperialism in provoking war. We warn the British and French colonialists that if they do not stop their aggressive actions, they will surely be opposed by the people of the world.
    We will do our utmost to support the Egyptian people. We believe that with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the Egyptian people will surely be able to defeat British and French imperialism. The British and French colonialists will be punished by justice.

    Mothers' Hearts Fly to the Banks of the Nile
    We are mothers with children. We love peace dearly. After hearing the news of the Anglo-French imperialist armed aggression against Egypt, we express our firm protest against this aggressive act of the Anglo-French imperialists that violates the UN Charter and undermines world peace. We are encouraged by the independence and freedom that the Egyptian people have already achieved and by every victory of the Egyptian people's just struggle! We cannot tolerate the atrocities of imperialists killing and arson. Our hearts—the hearts of mothers who love their children—have now flown to the banks of the Nile. We want to protect the children—the future flowers of mankind—to grow up in a peaceful environment, blooming ever more vigorously.
    British and French colonialists, we warn you: those who play with fire will burn themselves. Quickly put down your heinous butcher knives! The Egyptian people are not isolated. The Egyptian people have the support of billions of righteous people.
        Family Dormitory A6, Central Institute for Nationalities, Yan Xi, Hua Lan, and six others

    As I write these lines, it is already late at night. I turned on the radio, and the announcer is reporting the news of the Anglo-French war of aggression against Egypt. I can't calm down. I seem to see the magnificent buildings of Cairo burning with fire, and I seem to hear the moans of the sisters who were bombed on the streets of Alexandria.
    In the name of a mother of four children, I shout to the Anglo-French colonialists: retract your dirty hands and don't set fire to Egypt! Otherwise, what you will encounter is not only the fiery resistance of the entire Egyptian people but also the stern condemnation of peace-loving people all over the world. Even my child, who is not yet four years old, is shouting loudly after hearing the news on the radio: "Support Uncle Egypt! Support Uncle Egypt!"
    I, an ordinary Chinese woman, will never spare my strength for peace. When millions upon millions of people have awakened and taken action, they will form a sea of fire that will ultimately bury the colonialists.
    —I am preparing!
                                Beijing No. 4 Girls' Middle School Language Teacher Chen Guangyu

    Support from Medical Personnel
    We feel boundless anger at the barbaric and despicable armed aggression of Britain and France. We fully support the Egyptian people's loyal, courageous, patriotic, and national sovereignty-defending spirit of resolutely fighting against the aggressors. We support our government's "Statement on the Anglo-French Armed Aggression Against Egypt." We are workers of the Red Cross, and based on humanitarianism and defending world peace, we stand firmly with the Egyptian people and are ready at all times to dedicate all our strength to support the Egyptian people's just struggle.
        Zhang Jinghe, Wu Feiying, and seventy-two other staff members of the Red Cross Society of China

    Volunteer to Go to Egypt to Defeat the Aggressors
    All the staff and workers of our factory firmly support our government's statement on November 1 and fully support Egypt's anti-colonialist struggle. If the situation requires it, we will take up arms and volunteer to go to Egypt to defeat the aggressors alongside the Egyptian people.
                                  All Staff and Workers of the Beijing Musical Instrument Factory

    Hearing the news of the armed aggression against Egypt by Britain and France, I felt extremely angry! Just as the people of the world are striving for peace and many countries are engaged in peaceful construction, Britain and France have ignited the flames of aggression. This is a malicious disruption of international peace, a serious provocation to the people of the world, and a shameless act of aggression!
    Britain and France have long intended to invade Egypt. Israel's attack on Egypt was launched to create an excuse for this conspiracy. Sure enough, following closely behind Israel, Britain and France raised their butcher knives against the peace-loving people of Egypt!
    The Chinese people will never allow warmongers to disrupt peace and carry out wars of aggression! We warn the British and French governments to immediately put down your butcher knives! We warn the Israeli government to immediately withdraw from the sacred territory of Egypt!
    We ask the British and French people to immediately put pressure on your governments to force them to stop the war of aggression immediately! We appeal to the people of the world to unite and overthrow the warmongers!
    We support the Egyptian people's just struggle to defend their territorial sovereignty, we sympathize with the Egyptian people, and we express to the Egyptian people and government: the Chinese people support you and will always stand with you!
    I express my willingness to participate in all necessary activities to support the Egyptian people's struggle!
    We warn the British and French governments: those who play with fire will burn themselves! Beijing Ding Ergang

    We three are demobilized soldiers. We understand the meaning of freedom and happiness, and at the same time, we deeply understand the harm of war to mankind. Now the British and French imperialists, using Israel's invasion of Egypt as an excuse, disregarding the Egyptian people and the peace-loving people of the world, openly invade Egyptian territory. We cannot ignore this act of aggression. We are willing to join the Egyptian people's just war as volunteers.
                          Beijing Li Yousong Peng Shijie Mao Zhen

    We Firmly Support the Egyptian People's Just Struggle
    The British and French imperialists violated all international laws and morals and openly carried out armed aggression against Egypt. We feel very indignant and protest against this imperialist banditry. We demand that the United Nations take effective measures quickly to stop the Anglo-French aggression.
    We fully support our government's statement on the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt and firmly support the Egyptian people's heroic anti-colonialist struggle. We firmly believe that the Egyptian people, with the support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, will surely achieve victory.
                        All Staff of the Planning Department of the Steel Bureau, Ministry of Metallurgical Industry

    All the staff and workers of the Beijing No. 1 Iron Factory feel extremely indignant at the armed aggression against Egypt by the British and French imperialists. This is a threat to world peace and a threat to countries and peoples who oppose colonialism and demand independence and autonomy. We fully support our government's "Statement on the Anglo-French Armed Aggression Against Egypt." We love peace and oppose aggression. We support the Egyptian people's just struggle. We believe that this act of aggression by the British and French imperialists, which undermines international peace, will inevitably be severely countered by the people of Egypt and Arab countries and will also be resolutely opposed by the people of all countries in the world. We need a peaceful life, and we hope even more that the Egyptian people and the people of all countries can live peaceful and independent lives. Resolutely oppose imperialist aggression. We cannot ignore the Anglo-French imperialist aggression against Egypt.
                              All Staff and Workers of the Beijing No. 1 Iron Factory

    With great anger, we lodge a serious protest against the Anglo-French imperialist and Israeli aggression against Egypt.
    We fully support President Nasser of Egypt in leading the entire Egyptian people in their heroic struggle to safeguard Egypt's sovereignty and dignity.
    We love peace and resolutely oppose colonialist aggression. We oppose any country infringing on the sovereignty of another country. If the British and French imperialists do not stop their aggressive actions, they will reap the consequences of their own evil deeds. Final victory will surely belong to the Egyptian people.
    Egyptian worker friends, fight hard! All peace-loving and just people around the world are on your side. Let us fight together to the end for the cause of justice and peace. All Staff and Workers of the Beijing Municipal Real Estate Administration Construction Engineering Company

    We believe that the Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt has seriously threatened peace and security in the Middle East and the world. We unanimously express our boundless anger and resolute opposition to this act of aggression by imperialism. Peace-loving people all over the world must immediately stop the imperialist aggression. We, the Chinese people, will definitely give strong support to Egypt's just action of resisting aggression and defending sovereignty.
    Zhao Zengji, Yang Hechang, and twenty-nine others from the Beijing Xisi District Federation of Industry and Commerce

    The Chinese people have suffered all forms of aggression and bullying from imperialists. For the sake of their motherland's independence and freedom, the Chinese people waged a long and unyielding struggle against the imperialists. The sacrifices were enormous, but the final victory belonged to us. This is how it is with our country, and this is how it is with the liberation struggles of all oppressed nations. This is how history is.
    We firmly believe that the Egyptian people's just struggle against aggression will surely achieve final victory, and the aggressors will dig their own graves. We want the Anglo-French aggressors to know that the 600 million liberated Chinese people, the people of Asia and Africa, and the people of the world are all the backing of the Egyptian people. We will never ignore the imperialists' aggressive acts.
        Huo Shiliang, Mu Yunfeng, and six others from the Beijing Electric Power Design Branch

    When we learned the news that Britain, France, and Israel had launched a war of aggression against Egypt, we felt extremely angry! After the United Nations had already passed six fair principles for resolving the Suez Canal issue, the Anglo-French imperialists suddenly disregarded international credibility and the solemn obligations they undertook as members of the United Nations. In order to restore their colonial interests in Egypt, they brazenly launched an attack on Egypt. This is an out-and-out act of piracy! Under the leadership of President Nasser, the Egyptian people are waging a just war of resistance to defend their national sovereignty and independence, which has received the deepest sympathy and support from the people of the world. At the same time, we believe that the just war launched by the Egyptian people, with the support of the people of the world, will surely achieve final victory; the war of aggression waged by the Anglo-French imperialists, under the resolute resistance of the Egyptian people and the opposition of the people of the world, will eventually suffer a shameful defeat. As citizens of the People's Republic of China and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we firmly declare here: we must stand with the Egyptian people and the people of the world and support Egypt's just struggle with practical actions. We will never allow the Anglo-French imperialists to realize their arrogant plan to restore colonial rule in Egypt!
    Now, the United Nations General Assembly has convened an emergency meeting to discuss the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt. We believe that the United Nations is currently facing the most serious test. We demand that the United Nations immediately take the most resolute measures, in accordance with the sacred purpose of maintaining world peace, to stop the Anglo-French imperialists' aggression against Egypt. At the same time, we fully support Voroshilov and Bulganin's suggestion in their respective letters to Sukarno and Nehru to immediately convene an emergency meeting of countries participating in the Asian-African Conference to discuss the issue of stopping the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt. We believe that the countries participating in the Bandung Conference will definitely be faithful to the spirit of the Bandung Conference and support the Egyptian people's sacred war to defend national sovereignty and national independence with practical actions, and will never allow the Anglo-French imperialists' aggressive attempts to succeed.
      Navy Soldiers Fan Deyi, Chen Tong, Wang Minde, Han Yongcai, Gu Hanxiang

    The large-scale armed aggression against Egypt by the British and French governments has aroused immense indignation among the people of our country. The Anglo-French imperialists' playing with the flames of war is a provocation to the peace-loving people of the world. We must not ignore it!
    The Anglo-French aggression, under the pretext of "protecting the Suez Canal," is a trampling on international morality. We will never allow this aggressive conspiracy to succeed. We must seriously warn the aggressors: you must clear your heads. In the 1950s of the 20th century, dreaming of reimposing colonialism on the Egyptian people is doomed to failure. No amount of force will overwhelm the Egyptian people's just struggle for independence and autonomy. The Suez Canal issue can only be resolved peacefully.
    All the staff of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce unanimously support the government's statement condemning the Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt. Together with the people of the whole country, we resolutely support the Egyptian people's just struggle with all our strength and resolutely oppose the evil acts of the Anglo-French imperialists. All Staff of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce

    The naked aggression of Britain, France, and Israel in armed aggression against Egypt, attempting to seize the Suez Canal by force, has aroused our great indignation! This barbaric move by Britain and France is clearly a provocation to the peace-loving people of the world and a serious threat to the cause of world peace. We are a cultural organization that educates the vast number of children and young people to oppose wars of aggression and love peace. We will never allow the flames of wars of aggression to harm our children's generation again. We resolutely support the Egyptian people's just struggle to defend their motherland and oppose aggression through our work; and we call on the fathers and mothers of children all over the world: for the safety of Egyptian children's lives, for the sake of children all over the world to be spared the disasters of war, let us mobilize and extinguish the flames of the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt! All Staff of the China Children's Publishing House

    After we heard the extremely hateful news of the joint armed aggression against Egypt by the British and French imperialists, our forty-four young hearts simultaneously ignited flames of unsuppressible anger. The evil actions of the joint armed aggression against Egypt by the British and French imperialists seriously threaten world peace and disrupt human tranquility.
  Like the Egyptian people and peace-loving people all over the world, we need peace and oppose war. We have not forgotten the years of war just past, and we have not forgotten the disasters of broken families, deaths, and displacement brought to us by the war of aggression. We must not allow wars of aggression to destroy human civilization again. We resolutely oppose the British and French imperialists rekindling the evil flames of the war of aggression, and we fully support the Egyptian people's heroic and just struggle to defend national sovereignty and national independence. We once again solemnly warn the Anglo-French imperialist aggressors: the peace-loving and just people of the world will never allow you to set fire to Egypt. If you dare to go against the will of the people of the world, you will move toward the brink of destruction. All Students of Class Two, Senior Three, Beijing No. 5 Middle School

    We Will Sacrifice Everything to Support You
    The British and French imperialists are unreasonable. They want to seize the Suez Canal and prevent the Suez Canal from returning to the embrace of its motherland.
    We know that the Suez Canal is as beautiful as our Chinese rivers, and the Egyptian people will resolutely not allow the robbers to infringe upon it. Today, after the teacher read the newspaper to us, we jumped up excitedly. We know that the British and French imperialists are unreasonable. They want to hinder human peace, and their behavior has aroused our anger. Dear Egyptian friends, we will definitely support your just and heroic struggle. Please send our greetings to the Egyptian children. When you are in trouble, we will sacrifice everything to support you. Even if our dearest people—fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters—join your ranks of struggle and fight with you, we are willing!
    All Members of the First Squadron of Huabei Elementary School, Beijing (Young Pioneers)

    英法侵略者必将受到正义的制裁
    编者按：英国和法国对埃及发动侵略战争的消息传来，引起了我国人民的极大愤慨。11月1日、2日两天之间，本报就收到首都读者的数百封来信，抗议英、法的侵略行为，并表示对埃及人民正义斗争的同情和支持。现将部分来信发表如下：
    各民族青年的愤怒

    我们将尽最大努力支持埃及人民。相信埃及人民在全世界爱好和平的人民支持下，一定能战胜英、法帝国主义。英、法殖民主义者将受到正义的制裁。

    母亲们的心飞到尼罗河畔
    我们是有了孩子的妈妈。我们酷爱和平。我们听到了英法帝国主义武装侵略埃及的消息后，对英法帝国主义的这种违反联合国宪章、破坏世界和平的侵略暴行，表示坚决的抗议。我们为埃及人民已经取得的独立和自由、为埃及人民正义斗争的每一个胜利而鼓舞！我们不能容忍帝国主义者的杀人放火的暴行，我们的心——母亲爱护孩子的心，现在已经飞到尼罗河畔，我们要保护孩子们——人类未来的花朵，在和平的环境中成长起来，愈开愈盛。
    英法殖民主义者，我们警告你们：玩火必自焚其身。赶快放下你们的万恶的屠刀吧；埃及人民不是孤立的，埃及人民有着亿万正义人民的支援。
          中央民族学院家属宿舍甲6号　彦希　华兰等六人
    当我写下这几行字的时候，已经是深夜，我打开收音机，播音员正在报告着英法公然发动侵埃战争的消息，我怎末也宁静不下来。我仿佛看到开罗市的巍峨大厦燃烧着的火光，我仿佛听到亚历山大街头被炸的姐妹们的呻吟。
    我以四个孩子的母亲的名义，向英法殖民者大喝一声：缩回你那肮脏的手，不许在埃及放火！否则，你所遇到的，不仅是全埃及人民烈火般的反抗，而且是全世界爱好和平人民的严厉的挞伐。连我不满四岁的孩子，听到了收音机里的消息，都在大声嚷叫：“援助埃及叔叔！援助埃及叔叔！”
    我，一个普通的中国妇女，为了和平，绝不吝惜自己的力量。当千千万万的人都已觉醒并且行动起来，将会组成一片最终地葬送殖民者的火海。
    ——我在准备着！
                            北京市女四中语文教员　陈光玉
    医务人员的支援
    我们对英法的野蛮的卑鄙的武装侵略行为，感到无比的愤怒。我们完全支持埃及人民忠勇爱国、保卫国家主权、向侵略者坚决斗争的精神。我们拥护我们政府发表的“关于英、法武装侵略埃及的声明”。我们是红十字会的工作者，我们本着人道主义、保卫世界和平的立场，坚决与埃及人民站在一起，时刻准备着献出自己的一切力量，支援埃及人民这一正义的斗争。
          中国红十字会工作人员张景和　吴飞英等七十二人
    志愿到埃及去击败侵略者
    我厂全体职工坚决拥护我国政府11月1日的声明，并全力支持埃及的反殖民主义斗争。如果形势需要的话，我们将拿起武器，志愿到埃及，和埃及人民并肩击败侵略者。
                                  北京市乐器厂全体职工
    听到英法两国武装侵略埃及的消息，我心里非常愤怒！正当世界人民努力谋求和平，许多国家进行和平建设之际，英法却燃起侵略战火，这是对国际和平的恶毒破坏，是对世界人民的严重挑衅，这是无耻的侵略行径！
    英法想侵略埃及，是蓄意已久了的。以色列对埃及的进攻，是为这阴谋制造借口而发动的；果然，紧跟在以色列之后，英、法向爱好和平的埃及人民扬起屠刀！
    中国人民决不容许战争贩子破坏和平，进行侵略战争！我们警告英法政府，立刻放下侵略的屠刀！我们警告以色列政府，立刻退出埃及的神圣国土！
    我们要求英法人民：立刻向政府施加压力，迫使他们马上停止侵略战争！我们向全世界人民呼吁：一致起来打倒战争贩子！
    我们支持埃及人民为维护领土主权的正义斗争，我们同情埃及人民，我们向埃及人民及政府表示：中国人民支持你们，永远和你们站在一起！
    我表示愿意参加支持埃及人民进行斗争的一切必要的活动！
    我们警告英法政府：玩火者必当自焚！　北京　丁尔纲
    我们三人都是转业军人。我们懂得自由幸福的意义，同时也深切地体会到战争对人类的危害。现在英法帝国主义者以以色列侵犯埃及为借口，不顾埃及人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的反对，公然侵犯埃及的领土。对这种侵略行为，我们不能置之不理。我们愿意以志愿兵的身份参加埃及人民的正义战争。
                          北京　李友松　彭士杰　毛震
    我们坚决支持埃及人民的正义斗争
    英法帝国主义违反一切国际公法与道义，公然向埃及实行武装侵略，我们感到十分愤慨，我们抗议这种帝国主义的强盗行为。我们要求联合国迅速采取有效措施来制止英法的侵略行动。
    我们完全拥护我国政府关于英法侵略埃及事件的声明，坚决支持埃及人民的反殖民主义的英勇斗争。我们深信埃及人民在全世界爱好和平的国家与人民的支持下，一定能取得胜利。

    埃及职工朋友们，努力战斗吧！全世界爱好和平的正义人民都站在你们这一边。让我们共同为正义和和平的事业奋斗到底。　北京市房地产管理局修建工程公司全体职工
    我们认为英法武装侵略埃及已经严重地威胁到中东和世界的和平与安全。对帝国主义这一侵略行动，我们一致表示无比的忿怒和坚决的反对。全世界爱好和平的人民必须立即制止帝国主义的侵略行为。我们中国人民对埃及的反抗侵略维护主权的正义行动，一定给以大力的支持。
    北京市西四区工商业联合会　赵增吉　杨鹤昌等二十九人
    中国人民受过帝国主义者给我们的一切形式的侵略、欺侮。中国人民为了自己祖国的独立、自由，向帝国主义者进行了长期不屈不挠的斗争，牺牲是巨大的，但最终胜利是属于我们的。我国是这样，一切被压迫民族的解放斗争也都是这样，历史就是这样。
    我们深信埃及人民正义的反侵略斗争一定会取得最后胜利，而侵略者必将自掘坟墓。我们要叫英、法侵略者们知道，六亿解放了的中国人民和亚、非人民以及全世界人民都是埃及人民的后盾。我们绝不对帝国主义者的侵略行为置之不理。
                北京电力设计分院　霍世亮　穆运丰等六人
    当我们知道英国、法国和以色列对埃及发动侵略战争的消息后，我们感到万分的愤怒！英法帝国主义在联合国已通过解决苏伊士运河问题的六项公正原则后，突然不顾国际信义，不顾自己作为联合国会员国所承担的庄严义务，为了恢复它们在埃及的殖民利益而悍然对埃及发动进攻，这是不折不扣的海盗行为！埃及人民在纳赛尔总统领导之下，为了维护国家的主权和独立而进行正义的抗战，得到了全世界人民最深切的同情和支持。同时，我们相信：埃及人民展开的正义战争，在全世界人民的支持下，一定能得到最后的胜利；英法帝国主义者进行的侵略战争，在埃及人民的坚决抵抗和全世界人民的反对下，最后一定会遭到可耻的失败。我们作为中华人民共和国的公民和中国人民解放军的军人，在这里坚决表示：一定要同埃及人民和全世界人民站在一起，以实际行动支持埃及的正义斗争，绝不允许英法帝国主义者实现他们在埃及恢复殖民主义统治的狂妄打算！
    现在，联合国大会已经召开紧急会议，讨论英法侵略埃及的问题，我们认为：联合国目前已面临最严重的考验，我们要求联合国根据维护世界和平的神圣宗旨，立即采取最坚决的措施，制止英法帝国主义者对埃及的侵略行为。同时，我们完全拥护伏罗希洛夫和布尔加宁分别给苏加诺和尼赫鲁的信中关于立即召开亚非会议参加国的紧急会议以讨论制止英法侵略埃及问题的建议。我们相信，万隆会议参加国一定会忠实于万隆会议的精神，以实际行动支援埃及人民维护国家主权和民族独立的神圣战争，绝不让英法帝国主义的侵略企图得逞。
      海军战士　范德一　陈彤　王敏德　韩永材　顾汉祥
    英国和法国政府对埃及大规模地武装侵略，激起我们全国人民无比的愤慨。英法帝国主义者玩弄战火，是向全世界爱好和平人民的挑衅；我们决不能置之不理！
    英法借口“保护苏伊士运河”为名，进行侵略之实，是对国际道义的蹂躏，我们决不容许这种侵略阴谋得逞。我们要严重警告侵略者：你们要把头脑放清醒些，在二十世纪五十年代的今天，梦想把殖民主义重新加在埃及人民头上是注定要失败的，任何武力也不会压倒埃及人民要求独立自主的正义斗争。苏伊士运河问题只能和平解决。
    我们北京市工商业联合会的全体工作人员，一致拥护政府关于谴责英、法武装侵略埃及的声明，和全国人民一道，坚决以全力支持埃及人民正义的斗争，坚决反对英、法帝国主义的罪恶行为。　北京市工商业联合会全体工作人员
    英、法和以色列武装侵犯埃及，企图武装侵夺苏伊士运河的露骨侵略行动，引起了我们极大的愤慨！英、法这种野蛮的蠢动，显然是对全世界和平人民的挑衅，是对世界和平事业的严重威胁。我们是以出版物来教育广大少年儿童反对侵略战争，热爱和平的文化机关，决不容许侵略战争的烟火再来熏害我们的儿童一代。我们坚决通过我们的工作，全力支持埃及人民保卫祖国反对侵略的正义斗争；并且向全世界孩子们的父亲、母亲们呼吁：为了埃及儿童的生命安全，为了全世界孩子们不再受到战争的灾祸，大家动员起来，扑灭英、法侵略埃及的战火！中国少年儿童出版社全体工作人员
    当我们听到英法帝国主义联合武装侵略埃及的使人万分痛恨的消息以后，我们四十四颗年青的心同时燃烧起压抑不住的愤怒的火焰。英法帝国主义联合武装侵略埃及的罪恶行动，严重的威胁了世界的和平，破坏了人类的安宁。
  同埃及人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一样，我们需要和平，我们反对战争。我们还没有忘记刚刚过去的战火纷飞的岁月，我们还没有忘记侵略战争给我们带来的家破人亡，流离失所的灾难。我们决不准许侵略战争再去摧毁人类的文明。我们坚决反对英法帝国主义重新燃起罪恶的侵略战争的烈火，我们以全力支持埃及人民为维护国家主权和民族独立而进行的英勇正义的斗争。我们再一次严正的警告英法帝国主义侵略者们：全世界爱好和平、主持正义的人民决不能准许你们在埃及放火，如果你们胆敢和全世界人民的意志背道而驰，你们将走向粉身碎骨的死亡的边缘。　北京五中高三二班全体同学
    我们将牺牲一切来支援你们
    英法帝国主义不讲理，要夺取苏伊士运河，不让苏伊士运河回到它祖国的怀抱。
    我们知道苏伊士运河像我们中国的河流一样美丽，埃及人民坚决不能容许强盗们侵犯它。今天，当老师给我们读了报以后，我们激动得跳起来了。我们知道英法帝国主义不讲理，他们要妨碍人类的和平，他们这种行为激起了我们的愤怒。亲爱的埃及朋友，我们一定会支持你们正义英勇的斗争，请代我们问候埃及的小朋友。当你们有困难的时候，我们将牺牲一切支持你们，就是我们最亲爱的人——爸爸、妈妈、哥哥、姐姐参加到你们的斗争行列，和你们一起作战，我们也愿意！
