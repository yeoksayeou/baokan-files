　　"The Elderly Supervision Post"
　　Chen Zequn

　　In our factory, whether a master is scolding a mischievous young worker, or a worker is criticizing a derelict cadre, it’s often accompanied by a saying: "You, you really need to have the Elderly Supervision Post deal with you!"

　　What exactly is "The Elderly Supervision Post?" It hasn't issued anything like the "Alert Bulletin" like the Youth Supervision Post, nor has it publicly criticized anyone over the loudspeaker. Yet, the entire factory knows about it, knows that its host and sole member is a sixty-eight-year-old retired worker, Uncle Liu.

　　What Uncle Liu's real name is, besides the comrades in the personnel department, everyone has long forgotten; it's as if he was born to be called "Uncle." This white-haired old man has been a lathe operator for fifty years. Since 1951, the union has repeatedly mobilized him to retire and enjoy his old age. At first, he always refused, saying: "Don't blame me, Liu, for being insatiable, I'm not ungrateful for your care, but everyone is working so happily, I can't bear to be idle!" It wasn't until he fell ill last year, and his health deteriorated further, that he reluctantly agreed after much persuasion, but he requested that the leadership agree to one condition: he must have an entrance pass for every workshop. The reason being: "I can't live without strolling around the workshop every day!"

　　After retiring, Uncle Liu still lived in the factory dormitory (he had no family; Aunt Liu had died more than thirty years ago, and his only son was drafted into the army by the Kuomintang and has been missing ever since. Uncle Liu has been living alone for many years, and before liberation, he didn't even have a fixed bed). But he didn't spend his old age idly in his small room; you can almost encounter him anywhere in the factory. Wherever there's a problem, wherever there's an accident, when a crowd is gathered to investigate, Uncle Liu is sure to be there. Once, in the middle of the night, a young worker damaged a lathe. Everyone else was still asleep, but Uncle Liu had already arrived at the scene. He looked at the lathe carefully, then criticized the young worker. Finally, he struck the ground heavily with his walking stick: "What kind of work is this! Sleeping on the job! The Youth Supervision Post will post a cartoon of you tomorrow, but tonight, let me, the Elderly Supervision Post, take care of you!"

　　The name "The Elderly Supervision Post" spread from then on.

　　Sometimes you can see Uncle Liu criticizing someone in the supply department: "Are you the purchasing agent for these tools? Even sending a child to buy soy sauce would be better than you!" A moment later, he might be shouting at the union: "Old Zhang, the cold-work master's wife is sick, and a pile of children are left unattended, do you know about it?" Sometimes you can see him bringing several technicians from the technology department, rushing towards the workshop, constantly saying: "Just talking is useless, you'll understand when you see it in the workshop!"

　　Moreover, the scope of supervision is not limited to workshops and departments, his post is sometimes set up in the dormitory hallway. Uncle Liu sits there guarding the night-shift workers, demanding that they all get a full six hours of sleep, otherwise they can forget about going out to play. If some day-shift workers come back and want to sing and make noise, Uncle Liu won't allow it either: "Go sing outside, the night-shift people need to sleep!"

　　"The Elderly Supervision Post" has many intangible files, all stored in Uncle Liu's mind. He is old but has a particularly strong memory. For example, he can tell you that there is something in the scrap yard that can be reused when you are missing something; when he meets you on the road, he will remind you to send the dirty clothes on the bed to the laundry; he will inquire if you forgot to send money home from your last paycheck... Moreover, he is almost a living grade book and attendance list for the after-work cultural school, he remembers everyone's scores and who skipped class to play. Once, he persuaded a young worker to return to class from the illuminated ball field, constantly urging him along the way, saying: "You failed twice, and you're still skipping school! Is a ball game something for someone like you to watch?"

　　However, Uncle Liu is sometimes very kind. I remember one time, a young worker was operating independently for the first time. Uncle Liu returned from "inspecting" the night school after 9 pm, still worried, so he went to the workshop and watched next to the lathe until 12 am, feeling relieved, before leaving. Before leaving, he sincerely praised him: "Truly the seed of a machinist! If your father were still alive, and saw you finish your apprenticeship tonight, he would surely take me out for a drink!"

　　"The Elderly Supervision Post" is not only prestigious within the factory, but has also become famous outside the factory. One worker loved to drink, and his wife couldn't persuade him no matter what, so she complained to Uncle Liu: "Please, old man, talk to him, that drunkard in my house!" The nurses at the hospital are all very happy to see Uncle Liu visiting, because as soon as Uncle Liu arrives, some disobedient young workers will obediently listen to the hospital's instructions.

　　Therefore, Uncle Liu's supervisory duties have become even busier recently. Someone jokingly asked him if he wanted to assign an assistant. Uncle Liu said: "I can still manage now. Next year, there will be three more retirements, and they have all signed up with me. We'll talk about it when the time comes!"

### “老年监督岗”

    “老年监督岗”
    陈泽群
    在我们厂里，不论是师傅教训一个调皮的青工，或者工人指责一个失职的干部，往往少不了这样一句话：“你呀，非得请老年监督岗来治治不可！”
    “老年监督岗”是怎么一回事呢？它既没有像青年监督岗一样出过“警钟快报”之类，也没有在广播器里指名批评过谁，然而全厂都知道它，知道它的主持人兼唯一的成员是一个六十八岁的退休工人，刘大爷。
    刘大爷本来的名字叫啥，除了人事科的同志以外，大家早就不太了然，像是他生来就叫“大爷”似的。这位满头白发的老人，已经做了五十年的车工。打1951年起，工会几次动员他退职养老，他最初总不肯依，说：“莫怪我姓刘的不知足，你们照顾我不是不受情，但大家干得这样欢，叫我闲下来可办不到！”直到去年他病了一场，健康程度就更差了些，好说好劝，他才勉强肯了，但要求领导方面答应他一个条件：各个车间的出入证，他都得领一张。理由是：“我一天不到车间遛遛，就过不得！”
    刘大爷退职后，仍然住在工厂的宿舍里（他没有家，刘大妈已在三十多年以前死去，唯一的儿子被国民党拉去当壮丁以后，一直没有消息。刘大爷一个人活着已经很有些年，解放以前连张固定的床铺也没有）。但他并没有把自己的晚年消磨在他的小房间里，你几乎可以在厂内任何地方遇到他。那里出了问题，那里发生事故，围着一堆人在研究的时候，刘大爷一定也在。有一次，半夜里，一个青工弄坏了一部车床，旁人都还在梦里，而刘大爷却就到了现场。他把车床看了又看，就批评起那个青工来了。最后，拐杖就在地上重重地敲起来：“你这算是那一门！上班打瞌睡！青年监督岗明天会贴你的漫画，今晚先让我这个老年监督岗管管你！”
    “老年监督岗”的名字，从此传开去了。
    有时候你可以看见刘大爷在供应科批评人：“你就是这批工具的采购员么？叫小孩子上街买酱油，也比你强些呀！”一会儿他可又在工会嚷开了：“冷作师傅老张家里老伴病了，一堆孩子没人照顾，你们知道了么？”有时候你可以看见他从工艺科找来几个技术员，匆匆忙忙往车间引去，口里不住地说：“光说没有用，到车间一看你们就明白了！”
    而且，监督范围并不止于车间和科室，他的岗位有时就设在宿舍的走廊上。刘大爷就坐在那里守着那些夜班工人，你们个个都得睡足六点钟，否则休想出去玩。有些白天班的工人回来，谁要唱和闹，刘大爷也是不准的：“你到外面唱去，人家夜班的人要睡！”
    “老年监督岗”有许多无形的档案，都存在刘大爷的脑子里。他年纪大而记性特别强，譬如说他可以当你缺少一件什么东西的时候告诉你废品库有一件什么东西可以改用；在路上碰到的时候，他会提醒你该把床上的脏衣服送给洗衣作，他会查问你上次发工资忘记往家里寄钱没有……。而且他几乎是业余文化学校的一本活的成绩纪录本和点名册，谁的分数多少，谁又贪玩旷了课，他都记得。有一次，他从灯光球场把一个青工劝回课堂，一路走一路不住地劝着说：“你两次不及格，还逃学！球赛是你这号人看的么？”
    然而，刘大爷有时候可和气呢。记得有一个青工第一次单独操作，刘大爷从夜校“巡课”回来已经九点多了，不放心，还到车间去，在车床旁边足足看到十二点，觉得放心了，才离开。走前还着实夸奖了一番：“真是机器匠的种！如果你老子还在世，看到你今晚出了师，少不得要拉我去喝两杯了！”
    “老年监督岗”不但在厂内有威望，在厂外也出了名，一个工人爱喝酒，他妻子怎么劝也不听，就告到大爷面前来了：“求您老人家说说他呀，我家里那个酒鬼！”医院的护士一见刘大爷去探病，就都很高兴，因为大爷一到，有些不听说的青工就都乖乖地肯听医院的话了。
    因此，刘大爷近来的监督业务就更忙了。有人笑问他要不要派个助手，刘大爷说：“现在还能对付，明年该又有三个人退休，他们都已向我报了名。到时候再说吧！”
