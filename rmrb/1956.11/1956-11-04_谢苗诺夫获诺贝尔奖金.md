Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 1st: The Swedish Academy of Sciences has awarded the Nobel Prize to Soviet scientist Academician Semenov, in recognition of his outstanding work in the study of chemical reaction processes.

    Academician Semenov is one of the most famous physicists and physical chemists in the Soviet Union. He has been the director of the Institute of Chemical Physics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences for more than 25 years. His achievements in the study of chemical reaction rates and gas combustion are well-known not only in the Soviet Union but also abroad. The discovery of chemical chain branching reactions and the creation of a rigorous theory explaining these reaction processes and natural phenomena are inseparable from Semenov's name.

    Communist Party member and scientist Semenov is now continuing to study chain reactions with great theoretical significance with his many students. He is the third person in the Soviet Union to receive the Nobel Prize. The two people who received this prize before him were Pavlov (1904) and Mechnikov (1908).

    谢苗诺夫获诺贝尔奖金
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科1日讯：瑞典科学院授予苏联科学家谢苗诺夫院士诺贝尔奖金，奖励他在研究化学反应过程方面的卓越工作。
    谢苗诺夫院士是苏联最著名的物理学家和理化学家之一。他领导苏联科学院物理化学研究所已经有二十五年多了。他在研究化学反应速度和煤气燃烧方面的成就，不仅在苏联而且在外国也是有名的。化学连锁分离反应的发现和说明这种反应过程和自然现象的严整理论的创立，都是与谢苗诺夫的名字分不开的。
    共产党员、科学家谢苗诺夫现在正同他的许多学生继续研究具有巨大理论意义的连锁反应。在苏联，他是第三个获得诺贝尔奖金的人。在他以前获得这种奖金的两个人是巴甫洛夫（1904年）和麦奇尼科夫（1908年）。
