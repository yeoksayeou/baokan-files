Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 12th: The French "Government Gazette" published on the 10th a new government decision to restrict the consumption of gasoline and other petroleum products nationwide. It stipulates that, starting from the 12th, refineries are not allowed to sell highly volatile gasoline, which accounts for one-third of current gasoline consumption. At the same time, diesel and all fuel oil will also be subject to rationing.

Industrial oil, which is currently mainly used by French state-owned railways, power companies, and heavy industry sectors, is already scarce and only enough to supply for four or five weeks.

The gazette pointed out that the measures to restrict oil consumption were directly caused by the "Suez Crisis".

    自食侵埃战争的恶果
    法国限制石油用量
    新华社12日讯　巴黎消息：法国“政府公报”10日刊载了政府关于限制全国汽油和其他石油产品的消费量的一项新决定。它规定，从12日起，炼油厂一律不许销售占目前汽油使用量三分之一的高度挥发性汽油。同时，柴油和所有燃料用油也要实行配给制。
    目前主要是法国国营铁路、电力公司和重工业部门使用的工业用油已经不多，只够供应四五个星期了。
    公报指出，限制石油消费量的措施是“苏伊士危机”直接引起的。
