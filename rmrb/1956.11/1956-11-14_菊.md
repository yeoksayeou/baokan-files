Chrysanthemum

Despite the fierce frost and approaching ice and snow, the chrysanthemums of the capital are on display in Zhongshan Park with an indomitable spirit.

This exhibition features over a thousand varieties of chrysanthemums, totaling more than ten thousand pots, displayed in eight different areas. It is larger and better than in previous years, and the arrangement is more innovative and well-organized.

I began painting chrysanthemums using sketching methods in 1925. At that time, the chrysanthemums were privately grown by two staff members of Tsinghua University, Yang Shouqing and Lu Biguang. They obtained many new varieties through arduous cultivation, and I also learned many methods of painting chrysanthemums. However, for the past thirty-one years, most of my life has been spent in dire straits. Especially during the Anti-Japanese War, there were many years when I had no chrysanthemums to paint, so every chrysanthemum season brought not joy, but indignation.

Now, this is the third Chrysanthemum Exhibition in the capital. Over the past three years, there has been new development every year: the Capital Gardening Bureau collects excellent varieties from the city and all over the country for processing and cultivation. Therefore, in terms of variety and quantity, it has far surpassed the Tsinghua University era. The comrades working in the park always provide convenience for me to sketch in the flower rooms, allowing me to observe carefully and paint frequently in front of the flowers, so that I can harvest something every year.

China was the earliest to cultivate chrysanthemums. Originally, chrysanthemums were very small wild plants. What Tao Yuanming loved was only a kind of small yellow flower. After the Tang and Song dynasties, they were gradually cultivated and enriched, and then spread to Japan and Europe.

The first cold wave after the Frost's Descent has already arrived, but the chrysanthemums are blooming when all other flowers are withering. This is precisely why the Chinese nation loves chrysanthemums.

Now, we can use scientific methods to cultivate chrysanthemums so that they are not limited to blooming in autumn and winter. As long as we use the shading method, covering the flower room with reed curtains and black cloth to keep the daily light exposure below ten hours, while still maintaining air circulation. This will enable early budding and early blooming. This is called "short-day treatment." Last year, our chrysanthemums welcomed the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Party on July 1st, and this year, many chrysanthemums adorned the celebrations for New Year's Day and the "May Day" International Labor Day. The variety of chrysanthemum symbolizes the richness and diversity of our multi-ethnic nation, and they also express the indomitable spirit of our national tradition.

    菊

    霜风多厉，冰雪来侵，而首都的菊花，以不屈不挠的精神，在中山公园展出了。
    这次展览的菊花有一千多品种，共一万多盆，分八处陈列，比往年更多、更好，而布置的方式，也更为新颖、更为妥善了。
    我的用写生方法画菊，是在1925年开始的。当时的菊花是清华大学的两位职员杨寿卿、鲁璧光私人所种，他们在艰苦培养中，得到很多新种。而我也学到很多画菊的方法。但三十一年来，大部的生活是在不堪困苦中度过的。尤其在抗日战争时期，许多年是无菊可画，所以每到菊花时节，没有快乐，只有愤慨。
    现在是首都菊展的第三届了。三年来，每年都有新的发展：首都园林管理局，收集本市和全国各地的佳种，加工培养。所以，在品种和数量上，已经远远超过清华园的时代了。公园中的工作同志，对于我到花房里写生，总是给予方便，使我能够细致地观察，经常地在花前描绘，使我每年都有收获。
    中国培养菊花最早。原来菊花是很小的野生植物。陶渊明所爱的还不过是黄色小花的一种。唐宋以后，逐渐培养，逐渐丰富起来，传至日本，传至欧洲。
    霜降后的第一次寒潮已经来到了，而菊花却在众卉雕落的时候盛开起来，中华民族喜爱菊花，正是为了这个缘故。
    现在，我们能用科学方法培养，使菊花不限于秋冬开花。只要用遮光法，用芦帘黑布把花房遮蔽起来，使每天光照在十小时以下，但空气仍须流通。这样就能提早生蕾，提早放花。这名为“短日照处理”。去年，我们的菊花，在7月1日，欢迎了党的诞生三十五周年，今年元旦和“五一”国际劳动节，都有很多菊花点缀庆祝。菊花的品种繁多象征着我们多民族的丰富多采，它们也表现了我们民族传统的不屈不挠的精神。
