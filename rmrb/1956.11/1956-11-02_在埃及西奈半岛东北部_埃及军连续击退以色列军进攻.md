    在埃及西奈半岛东北部
    埃及军连续击退以色列军进攻
    据新华社1日讯　开罗消息：埃及军方10月31日午后发表的公报说，西奈半岛的战事正在这个半岛的东北部、加沙地区以南伸入埃及领土内约二十英里的奥贾和阿布阿韦吉拉一带进行。
    这项公报说，埃及军队在10月30日下午到31日清晨在阿布阿韦吉拉地方前后击退了以色列军队的两次进攻，使它遭到重大损失，其中包括四辆坦克。以色列军队在31日早晨三点钟又发动了第三次进攻。双方正在激战。
    在10月31日的几次空战中，共有十架以色列飞机被击落。埃及方面有两架飞机没有返航。
    公报说，埃及空军袭击了在以—埃边境上集结的以色列增援部队，并且轰炸了以色列的飞机场，以色列方面受到重大损失。
    公报还说，埃及驱逐舰“易卜拉欣·阿瓦尔号”10月31日在轰击以色列的海法港以后，在返防途中同以色列舰只和飞机进行了遭遇战，埃及舰长在军舰的发动机受伤以后就把这只军舰自行炸沉了。
    另一方面，以色列方面宣称，西奈半岛上的埃及军队实际上已经被以色列军队包围。一支以色列的装甲特遣部队正从阿布阿韦吉拉朝北向位于地中海海岸的阿里希推进，其目的是要包围加沙地带的埃及部队。加沙地带是埃及东北部地中海沿岸同以色列接境的地方。过去以色列军队经常向这个地区侵扰。
    以色列方面还说，以色列的装甲部队已经在10月31日推进到离苏伊士运河十英里的地方。
