    A Childlike Heart
　　Zi Gang
    The three films of the French Film Week have been well received by audiences. Some like their fresh techniques and forms of expression, some like their concise and witty dialogues, and some like certain outstanding actors.
    Among the three films, I like "Forbidden Games" the most, because it is full of a childlike heart and can make the audience reach a state of selflessness. At one point in the plot, I, like many children present, actually laughed out loud; at that time, it seemed out of place in front of many Young Pioneers, but thinking about it afterwards, I am not ashamed of it at all. This unconscious laughter is precisely the effect of the film: to move people of all countries and ages together.
    Of course, this is not a film that purely makes the audience laugh. It is very profound, hiding tears, sighs, and thoughts behind the laughter. It inspires the audience to think, rather than giving away thoughts cheaply to the audience.
    When my family came out of the cinema after watching this film, I heard many children still calling "Michel, Michel..." My eight-year-old daughter was no exception. She was also wondering if those little actors were older or younger than her, and at the same time enthusiastically asked: "Did the little sister find Michel? Why does she have a sign tied around her neck? She is so pitiful without her parents!"
    Our family also thought of the Soviet film "Green Valley": the children, hiding from the sight of adults, are engaged in agricultural science experiments, harvesting a bumper crop from a wheat variety. It reveals the secrets of children's hearts in the socialist era, their wisdom breaking through the gates restricted by adults. The audience feels the joy of the children and also glimpses the complexity and depth of the children's spiritual world.
    "Forbidden Games" is actually sounding an alarm for adults: what kind of impact has war left on children? It is an artistic banner for defending world peace, but it is not a slogan. It also shouts "Long live the friendship of children," but it is also not a slogan.
    It kindly reminds us: if our children were in the situation of the film, they would also play with dead cats, dead dogs, cemeteries, and crosses. What is valuable is that the film does not express this theme in a straight line; it shows several related life scenes: Michel's family, the second sister and her lover, the feud and misunderstanding between the two families... making us feel that if the film is a tree in a landscape painting, then this tree is not only graceful in its trunk, but also lush in its branches and leaves.
    This makes me think of our children's literature works. Not to belittle ourselves, it seems that there are not many works that can be compared to "Forbidden Games" or "Green Valley." Often, there is more adult preaching, and less that naturally opens the hearts of children; that is, lacking a childlike heart. In life, we often let children read adult newspapers and magazines, speak adult words, wear cadre uniforms, or simply, parents rarely talk and play with their children, making themselves lose their childlike heart early, so it's no wonder that a childlike heart cannot be found in the works.
    From now on, we will learn from the traditional and modern cultures of many countries (and even more so, carry forward our own national cultural traditions). We have already benefited a lot from the French Film Week. We increasingly believe that the international cultural treasure house is a whole. The people of every country or nation will take something from it, and at the same time, generation after generation, put something into it, further enriching this treasure house.
    First of all, I thank the producers of this film for "Forbidden Games" awakening a childlike heart in the audience, because it seems that this is exactly what is full in our lives, but has been neglected by us.

    一片童心
　　子冈
    法国电影周的三部影片在观众中获得了好评，有人喜欢它们的新鲜手法和表现形式，有人喜欢它们简洁有风趣的对话，有人喜欢某几个杰出的演员。
    在三部影片中，我最喜欢“禁止的游戏”，因为它充满了一片童心，可以使观众达到忘我的境地。在一个什么情节上，我也像在场的许多儿童一样，竟笑出声音来了；当时在许多红领巾面前仿佛是失态的，但是事后想想，我一点也不为这件事脸红。这种不自觉的失笑正是影片的效果：让不分国界和年龄的人一齐感动。
    自然，这不是一张纯然让观众看后发笑的影片，它很深刻，在笑后面藏着泪，藏着叹息，藏着思想。它启发观众们去思想，而不是把思想廉价地赠送给观众。
    当我们一家人看完这部影片从影院出来，我听见多少孩子还在“米歇尔，米歇尔……”地喊着。我八岁的女儿也不例外，她还研究着那些小演员们比她大还是小，同时也热心追问：“小妹妹找到米歇尔没有？她脖子底下拴个牌儿干么？没有了爸爸妈妈，多可怜哪！”
    我们一家人连带地也想到了苏联影片“绿色山谷”：孩子们躲开成人的视线在从事农业科学的试验，从一种小麦品种得到了丰收，它揭露了社会主义时代中孩子们心灵上的秘密，他们的智慧攻破了成人们限制的闸门，观众们感受到孩子们的喜悦，也窥见了孩子精神世界的复杂深奥。
    “禁止的游戏”实际上是给成人们敲了警钟：战争给孩子留下了什么样的影响，它是保卫世界和平的一面艺术旗帜，但是，它不是口号。它也喊出了“孩子们的友谊万岁”，但是，它也不是口号。
    它亲切地提示我们：假如我们的孩子处在影片中的境地，也会玩起死猫死狗、坟地和十字架的。可贵的是影片不是直线地表现这个主题，它表现了有关的几个生活画面：米歇尔的一家，二姐和他的情人，两家的冤仇和误会……使我们觉得如果影片是风景画上的一棵树木，那么这棵树木不仅树干亭亭多致，而且枝叶繁茂。
    我由此想到了我们的儿童文学作品。不是妄自菲薄，似乎能和“禁止的游戏”或“绿色山谷”相比拟的作品还不多见，往往也是成人说教的居多，自自然然打开儿童们心扉的为少；也即缺少一片童心。在生活里我们常让孩子读大人书报、说大人话、穿干部服，或者索性作父母的也很少和孩子们谈心、游戏，弄得自己很早就丢失了童心，怨不得在作品里找不见童心了。
    从今以后，我们会向很多国家的传统文化和现代文化学习（也更加要发扬自己的民族文化传统），从法国电影周也已经获益不少。我们愈益相信：国际文化宝库是一个整体，每一个国家或民族的人民会从中有所取，同时也一代代投入了什么，更加丰富了这个宝库。
    首先，我为了“禁止的游戏”唤起了观众一片童心而感谢这张影片的制作者，因为仿佛这正是我们生活中充满着、但被我们忽视了的东西。
