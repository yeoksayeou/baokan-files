Instructions of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on Current Grain Work
November 21, 1956

    The current period is a crucial time for the autumn grain unified purchase and the comprehensive arrangement of unified grain sales in rural areas. Grasping this opportunity to purchase and store the grain stipulated for requisition this year, and to make reasonable adjustments to urban and rural grain supply in a timely manner, is a major task for party and government organs at all levels. This year, many localities have not seriously managed grain supply work, resulting in sales exceeding plans, and grain requisition work has not been grasped tightly enough. This situation must be changed immediately. To this end, the CCP Central Committee and the State Council believe that while implementing the October 12th instructions on current grain work, the following instructions should also be implemented.

    I. The grain requisition task for the 1956-1957 fiscal year must be completed in a timely manner. According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, the national grain output in 1956 will increase by more than 20 billion catties compared to 1955; the grain requisition task for the 1956 fiscal year will be reduced by 5.8 billion catties compared to the actual requisition volume of the previous year; it is entirely possible to complete this task. However, it must also be noted that the disasters in Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hunan, Guangxi, Jilin and other provinces in 1956 were severe, and the situation of good and bad harvests varies greatly across the country. Therefore, in order to ensure the completion of this year's grain requisition task, it is necessary to earnestly implement the principle of appropriately increasing purchases in areas with good harvests on the basis of "three fixings" for grain (fixing of output, purchase, and sales). That is, from the increased production of agricultural cooperatives or individual farmers where the actual output exceeds the "three fixings" output, the increase in purchase should not exceed 40%. And it must be ensured that the stipulated requisitioned grain is stored on time and in full. The grain distribution of national agricultural cooperatives should correctly handle the relationship between the state, the agricultural cooperatives, and the members. The distribution of grain in agricultural cooperatives must, in principle, strictly adhere to the following order of priority: First, the state's grain requisition and purchase tasks (including the increased purchase tasks of cooperatives with increased production) must be completed first; Second, seeds necessary for agricultural cooperative production must be retained, and basic rations and necessary feed grain must be distributed to all members; Third, after solving the above two problems, the needs of members with strong labor and more workdays should be taken care of, and the grain for the necessary development of sideline production should be arranged.

    II. The unified grain sales work in rural areas must be closely integrated with the grain requisition work and arranged in a unified manner. While verifying the grain requisition task for surplus grain cooperatives (households) this year, the grain supply indicators for grain-deficient cooperatives (households) this year must be verified. Each agricultural cooperative should follow last year's method, convene a members' meeting at the cooperative level, absorb individual farmers to participate, formally adopt a grain plan, and educate farmers to strictly abide by the state's grain purchase and supply plans and use grain rationally. For seasonal grain-deficient cooperatives (households), a monthly supply plan should be formulated according to the principle of when grain is lacking and when supply begins, and grain supply certificates should be issued directly to grain-deficient members (households). The state grain agencies should divide the areas and assign dedicated personnel to manage them. During the period from November this year to February next year, except for severely affected areas and non-agricultural populations, grain sales should be basically avoided in rural areas, so as to ensure sufficient grain supply in rural areas during the spring plowing season next year. Agricultural cooperatives and individual farmers should be educated not to use rations and seeds for sideline production. To engage in sideline production with surplus grain, only sideline workshops such as flour mills and tofu workshops should be opened, and restaurants should not be opened.

    III. The fixed-quantity grain supply in towns and cities was once too tight, and after several adjustments, it is now generally too loose and should be rationally compressed and adjusted. First, the ration supply for urban residents has increased by an average of three to four catties per person per month over the past year, and the quota standard is already too high. In areas where rice is the staple food, the average should be reduced by one catty per person per month on the current level, and in special cases, it can be reduced by half a catty; in areas where coarse grains and flour are the staple food, the average should be reduced by half a catty to one catty per person per month, and in special cases, the amount of reduction can be less than half a catty. When making the above adjustments, the different situations of residents should be distinguished, with larger reductions for those who should be reduced more, and smaller reductions for those who should be reduced less; individual quotas that are too low should be appropriately increased. Appropriate consideration should be given to newly developed industrial and mining areas. Second, the supply standard for industry grain use should be slightly higher than the level before the implementation of fixed-quantity supply in 1954, and slightly lower than the current actual supply volume; it is necessary to ensure the normal needs of production and the market, and to effectively control sales. Third, the ration supply for migrant workers participating in national economic construction and national defense construction should continue to implement the method of differential subsidies. That is, the grain required by migrant workers should generally be delivered with grain stamps according to the ration standard at home, and the state only subsidizes the insufficient portion of actual grain consumption. Fourth, the purchase of grain replicas such as noodles, sliced noodles, rice flour, and New Year cakes, as well as minor grains, should continue to be carried out with grain stamps.

    IV. Grain agencies at all levels must formulate monthly plans for grain sales in towns and cities and rural areas, issue monthly sales targets, and strictly control them. If over-sales or excessively tight situations are found, inspections should be carried out immediately and resolved in a practical and realistic manner.

    Party and government leading organs at all levels must immediately allocate a period of time to list the current unified purchase and sales of grain in rural areas as the key to rural work, and, as in the past few years, mobilize the entire party and go all out. In cities, sufficient forces should also be organized to rectify the fixed-quantity grain supply in towns and cities. Education on the policy of unified purchase and sales of grain and education on saving grain should be strengthened for all cadres and the people of the whole country to ensure that the current grain work is done effectively.

    中共中央　国务院关于当前粮食工作的指示
    一九五六年十一月二十一日
    目前正是秋粮统购和全面安排农村粮食统销的紧要时期。抓住这一时机，把本年度规定征购的粮食如数征购入库，并且及时地把城乡粮食供应进行合理调整，是各级党政机关当前的重大任务。今年有很多地方，对于粮食供应工作没有认真管理，致使销量超过计划，对于粮食征购工作也还没有抓紧。这种状况必须立即改变。为此，中共中央和国务院认为在贯彻执行10月12日关于目前粮食工作指示的同时，还应当执行如下指示。
    一、1956——1957年度的粮食征购任务，必须及时完成。根据农业部初步统计，1956年全国粮食产量将比1955年增加二百多亿斤；1956年度粮食征购任务比上年度实际征购数量减少五十八亿斤；完成这个任务是完全可能的。但是，又必须看到1956年河北、河南、安徽、江苏、湖南、广西、吉林等省灾情严重，全国各地丰歉情况很不平衡。因此，为了保证完成本年度的粮食征购任务，必须在粮食“三定”的基础上，认真贯彻执行在丰收地区酌量增购的原则。即从农业社或个体农民实际产量多于粮食“三定”产量的增产部分中，增购不超过40％的数量。并且保证把规定征购的粮食，如数按时入库。全国农业合作社的粮食分配，对国家、农业社和社员之间的关系，应当正确处理。农业社分配粮食在原则上必须严格遵守下列先后顺序：第一、首先完成国家的粮食征、购任务（包括增产社的增购任务）；第二、留下农业社生产必需的种子，分给全体社员基本口粮和必要的饲料用粮；第三、在解决了上述两项问题以后，再照顾劳动强和出工多的社员的需要，安排必需发展的副业生产的用粮。
    二、农村粮食统销工作，必须与粮食征购工作密切结合，统一安排。在核定本年度余粮社（户）粮食征购任务的同时，必须把本年度缺粮社（户）的粮食供应指标加以核定。各个农业社应该仿照去年的办法，以社为单位举行社员大会，吸收个体农民参加，正式通过粮食计划，教育农民严格遵守国家粮食收购和供应计划，合理使用粮食。对季节性的缺粮社（户），应当根据什么时候缺粮、什么时候开始供应的原则，规定分月供应计划，把粮食供应证直接发给缺粮的社员（户），由国家粮食机关划分地段，指定专人管理。在今年11月到明年2月这一段时间内，除重灾区和非农业人口外，在农村应当做到基本上不销粮食，以便在明年春耕生产季节，保证农村粮食的充分供应。应当教育农业社和个体农民，不能动用口粮和种子去搞副业生产，用剩余的粮食去经营副业，只能开粉坊、豆腐坊等副业作坊，不应当开设饭店。
    三、市镇粮食定量供应过去曾一度偏紧，经过几次调整以后，目前又一般偏宽，应当进行合理的压缩和调整。第一、市镇居民的口粮供应，一年来每人每月平均增加了三斤到四斤，定量标准已经偏高，要求大米为主食的地区，在现有水平上每人每月平均降低一斤，有特殊情况的可以降低半斤；要求杂粮和面粉为主食的地区，每人每月平均降低半斤到一斤，有特殊情况的，降低的数量可以低于半斤。在进行上述调整的时候，应该区别居民的不同情况，该多降的就多降，该少降的就少降；个别定量偏低的，还应当适当提高。对新发展的工矿区，应予适当照顾。第二、今后对行业用粮的供应标准，应当稍高于1954年实行定量供应前的水平，又略低于现在的实际供应量；既要保证生产和市场的正常需要，又要切实控制销量。第三、对参加国家经济建设和国防建设的民工的口粮供应，应当继续实行差额补助的办法。即民工所需口粮一般应该按照在家的口粮标准交付粮票，国家只补助实际吃粮的不足部分。第四、对挂面、切面、米粉、年糕等粮食复制品和小杂粮，继续实行凭粮票购买的办法。
    四、各级粮食机构，对市镇和农村的粮食销量，必须按月制定计划，下达月度销售指标，严格控制。如果发现超销或过紧的情况，要立即进行检查，并实事求是地加以解决。
    各级党政领导机关，必须立即划出一段时间，把当前农村粮食的统购统销工作列为农村工作的重点，并像过去几年那样，全党动员，全力以赴。在城市，也应当组织足够力量，从事整顿市镇粮食定量供应工作。应该对全体干部和全国人民加强粮食统购统销政策的教育和节约粮食的教育，保证把当前的粮食工作切实做好。
