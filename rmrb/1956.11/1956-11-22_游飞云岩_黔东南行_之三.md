Traveling to Feiyun Rock
——Part 3 of "A Trip to Southeastern Guizhou"
Jian Xian'ai

Many years ago, I heard elders talk about Feiyun Rock in Huangping County. Later, I read a poem by Zheng Ziyin (Zhen), a poet from Zunyi in the Qing Dynasty, praising Feiyun Rock. He began by saying, "The land and its spirits are each divided, Guizhou gains this cloud." In his poem, he recounted how, in order to explore the ancient and wondrous Feiyun Rock, he spared no effort to detour for five days, finally finding this secluded forest. Indeed, seeing it was better than hearing about it. He said that if he could buy a house to live by the rock, looking down at the bustling world below, it would seem like mere flying mosquitoes. This further enhanced my longing.

In 1951, when we participated in the work of southeastern Guizhou, we passed through Huangping in a hurry and did not stop in Dongpo Township (where Feiyun Rock is located). This time, I was able to enjoy the trip and fulfill my desire of more than ten years.

Feiyun Rock, known locally as Feiyun Cave, is located twenty miles east of Huangping in Guizhou. This place is called Dongpo Mountain, also known as Yuetan (Moon Pool). The scenic spot is right by the road. From the road, we could see from afar the high mountains shrouded in mist, nestled in a lush forest, obscuring its face. At the foot of the mountain stood a majestic temple gate made of bluestone, with three upright, dragon-and-snake-like characters "Feiyun Rock" carved in the center of the gate. Below was a blue and white mosaic plaque: "The First Cave Heaven in Southern Guizhou." From the exquisite and delicate Bodhisattva statues and the stone lion carvings on the stone gate, we could see the beautiful creations of the working people of Guizhou. Two long couplets were also embedded on both sides of the gate. The famous Yuetan Temple is located to the left of the mountain gate. According to the "Huangping County Records," it was also called Yuetan Public Hall, built by Zhu Wenrui, a deputy envoy of the Ming Dynasty. Wang Yangming even wrote a memorial inscription for it, which was preserved for many years. After it was destroyed, several houses were still repaired to serve as places for tourists to rest. In the front hall of the temple, there is a plaque inscribed with "Arriving Here Clears the Mind" by Zhizhou Li Peilin in the thirty-second year of Guangxu, which has been blackened by coal smoke. "Yangyun Pavilion" is behind the hall, with an inscription by Qu Hongxun after its reconstruction in the year of Yiwu in the Guangxu reign. Next to the hall is a dry pond, which is Yuetan (Moon Pool). Some people believe that Yuetan Temple and Feiyun Rock complement each other, and once said: "The temple relies on the rock to generate wonder, and the rock gains color from the temple." The spacious main hall has long been without statues, appearing empty.

We met several farmers there, and we started talking to them. An old man said to us: "Comrades, before liberation, we were not allowed to come to Yuetan Temple. Only landlords and wealthy people could play on the mountain, drink wine, and play cards here every day. After the land reform, we set up a primary school in the temple. Later, the People's Government built new school buildings for us, and the temple became empty. I think it would be a good place for our Dongpo Township Advanced Cooperative to hold member meetings, as it is spacious and elegant."

We walked out from the side door on the right of the temple and stepped onto the stone steps. Beside the road was an ancient stele erected by Xiaoliao Jushi in the forty-fourth year of Jiajing. The inscription on the stele had become blurred and illegible. An old gentleman from the Cultural and Historical Research Institute reminded me:

"Pay attention, this is an old stele, three hundred and ninety years from now."

After climbing dozens more winding stone steps, we arrived at Feiyun Rock. The cave is surrounded by a dozen towering, ancient cypress trees, and the noisy chirping of cicadas blended together, making it particularly cool. The rock is semi-circular, seemingly a cave but not quite. Many strange and exquisite stalactites hang upside down, like clouds, some condensing, some stretching, some soaring. Some stalactites also resemble vivid images of birds, beasts, fish, dragons, hanging upside down on the rock. Looking up, the cliffs are steep, making people feel a little dizzy; but the inside is very wide, paved with stone slabs, and the edge of the cave is surrounded by stone railings. Some stone niches and remnants of statues remain on the rock wall. There are several ancient steles in the cave, some of which have been broken. The most eye-catching are the four large characters "Flying from the Sea" inscribed by Marquis Guoyong Yang Fang, each character occupying a stone tablet. Yang Fang, a native of Songtao County, Guizhou, was a submissive lackey of the Qing Dynasty, a butcher who massacred the people of the White Lotus Rebellion in Sichuan, Hubei, and Shaanxi, and the Hui people in Xinjiang. He once served as the governor of Hunan. Grand Scholar Heshen of the Qianlong era also came here and left an inscription. Although he was a corrupt official who sold offices and titles at that time, I think a few sentences in his inscription describing Feiyun Rock are correct:

"...The scenery of Feiyun Rock, taking a detour to climb, the jagged and strange rocks, inlaid and exquisite, like clouds hanging down, like dragons dancing, and like millions of green coins winding among the smoke and purple verdant, one suspects that even the work of ghosts and gods could not create such strangeness..."

Outside the temple gate of Feiyun Rock, there is a stone bridge with green moss. A clear spring flows under the bridge, the water flowing from the distant mountains, making a gurgling sound. I thought of Zheng Ziyin's poem "Ten miles of spring sounds connect to secluded valleys," which probably refers to this place.

    游飞云岩
    ——“黔东南行”之三
    蹇先艾
    很多年以前，我就听见父老们谈起过黄平县的飞云岩。后来读清代诗人遵义郑子尹（珍）咏飞云岩的诗，一开头他就这样赞美道：“扶舆灵秀各有分，贵州得此一朵云。”他在诗里叙述他为了探访古奇的飞云岩，不惜绕了五天的路程，终于找到了这个幽静的峦林，果然见面胜似闻名；他说，如果能够买到一所房子在岩边居住，低头一望，脚下扰攘的人间，简直就同飞蚊一样。这就更增强了我的向往。
    1951年，我们参加黔东南的工作，匆匆地路过黄平，在东坡乡（飞云岩所在地）并没有停车；这次才得畅游，满足了十多年来的愿望。
    飞云岩，当地的人都叫它做飞云洞，在贵州黄平东二十里，这里叫东坡山，又名月潭，名胜就在路旁。在马路上，我们远远地就望见了烟雾缭绕的高山掩映在一片蓊郁的大树林里，看不清它的面貌。山下伫立着一座青石建成的，巍峨的庙门，门中央镂刻了三个直立的，龙蛇飞舞的字“飞云岩”；下面便是一个蓝白色碎磁嵌成的横额：“黔南第一洞天”。从石门上那些精致、小巧的菩萨塑像和石狮的雕工，可以看出贵州劳动人民的美丽创造。门的两旁还嵌得有两副很长的对联。有名的月潭寺便在山门的左侧，据“黄平县志”记载，这里也叫月潭公馆，是明朝副使朱文瑞修建的，王阳明还给它做过碑记，保存了很多年；圮毁以后，仍然修葺了几幢房子，作为游人休息的地方。寺内前殿有一块光绪三十二年知州李培林题的“到此心清”的匾额，已被煤烟熏黑了。“养云阁”就在殿后，有光绪乙未瞿鸿勋在重建以后的题字。殿旁有一个枯竭了的池塘，就是月潭，有人认为月潭寺与飞云岩是互相辉映的，曾经这样说过：“寺附岩以生奇，岩得寺而增色”。轩敞的大殿里早已没有神像了，显得空空洞洞的。
    在那里遇到几个农民，我们便和他们谈起来。一位年老的向我们说：“同志们，解放前我们是不准到月潭寺来的，只有地主老财们才能天天在这里玩山、吃酒、打牌。土地改革以后，我们在庙里办了一所小学；后来人民政府给我们修了新校舍，这庙子就空起来了。我看，我们东坡乡高级社开社员大会，这倒是一个好地方哩，又宽敞，又幽雅。”
    我们从寺右的旁门走出去，一步一步地走上了石级，路旁有一座嘉靖四十四年霄寥居士立的古碑，碑文已经模糊漫漶得看不清了。一位文史馆的老先生提醒我道：
    “你注意，这是一块老碑，离现在有三百九十年了。”
    我们再上了几十步纡回的石梯，就到了飞云岩。岩洞被十几株参天拿云的，古老的柏树围着，烦嚣的蝉声响成了一片，显得特别荫凉。岩是半圆形，似洞非洞，很多奇异玲珑的石乳倒垂着，好像一朵一朵的云彩，有的凝聚，有的舒展，有的飞腾；有些石乳又像鸟兽鱼龙的各种生动的形象倒挂在岩上。抬头一看，壁立千仞，使人有点心摇目眩；但是里面很宽，铺着石板，洞边一带都是石栏围绕着的。岩壁上还留着一些石龛和神像的残迹。洞内有好几块古碑，有的已经断残了。最惹人注目的是果勇侯杨芳题的“海上飞来”四个斗大的字，每一个字占了一块石碑。杨芳，贵州松桃县人，是清朝俯首帖耳的走狗，屠杀川楚教民和新疆回族的刽子手，他曾经做过湖南的提督。乾隆年间的大学士和珅也到过这里，留下了一个碑记，尽管他是当时一个卖官鬻爵的坏人，我觉得他的碑记里有几句对飞云岩的描写，倒是不错的：
    “……飞云岩胜景，纡道登临，巑岏怪石，嵌空玲珑，如云下垂，如蛟起舞，又如青蚨万朵缭绕于烟霞紫翠间，疑鬼斧神工亦不能造此瑰异也。……”
    飞云岩的庙门外，有一座苔痕苍绿的石桥，桥下一泓清泉，水从远远的山间流来，发出淙淙的声音，我想起郑子尹诗里的“十里泉声接幽壑”，大概就是指的这里了。
