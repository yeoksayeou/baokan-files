After the National Handicraft Work Report Conference, wage adjustments have been made in some areas of sixteen provinces and cities (autonomous regions) including Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong. In Weifang, Yichang, and Zhengzhou alone, over 94% of cooperative members have seen an increase in income. In Zhengzhou, an electrical handicraft cooperative saw its members' average wage increase by 40% compared to before. After implementing a policy of diligence and frugality in managing the Tongzhou Iron Handicraft Cooperative, the members' wages in September increased by 62% compared to the same period last year.

Henan Province, based on the different circumstances of different industries, adopted measures such as outsourcing processing or in-house production to arrange auxiliary household labor. According to statistics for the third quarter, seven districts and five cities in Henan Province had placed 7,362 auxiliary laborers for cooperative members.

In many areas, public medical care and other welfare measures were implemented simultaneously with wage adjustments. In Weifang City, Shandong Province, 95.7% of cooperative members have access to public medical care, and it is stipulated that wages will be paid as usual for work-related injuries. Female cooperative members are granted 56 days of maternity leave with full pay. Elderly members who have lost their ability to work can enjoy a monthly living allowance, and funeral expenses are also provided to members' families in the event of death, based on their economic situation. A member of the Yichang Rope Cooperative said, "Now we are not afraid of birth, old age, sickness, or death."

    手工业社调整工资以后
    绝大部分社员收入增加
    本报讯　自从全国手工业汇报会议开过以后，在北京、上海、河北、山西、山东等十六个省市（自治区）的部分地区都做了工资调整工作，仅潍坊、宜昌、郑州三市，就有94％以上的社员增加了收入。郑州市的一个电器手工业合作社，社员平均工资比以前提高40％；通州市铁业手工业合作社实行勤俭办社以后，9月份社员的工资比去年同期提高了62％。
    河南省根据不同行业的不同情况，采取社外加工或社内生产的办法，安排家庭辅助劳动力，据第三季度的统计，河南省七个区五个市共安置了社员辅助劳动力七千三百六十二人。
    有不少地区，在调整工资的同时，实行了公费医疗和其他福利措施。山东省潍坊市95.7％的社员实行了公费医疗，并规定因公负伤工资照发。女社员生育期间给假五十六天，工资照发。年老丧失劳动力的，每月可享受生活补助，社员死亡，也根据其家庭经济情况给予丧葬费。宜昌市制绳社的社员说：“现在生老病死都不怕了”。
