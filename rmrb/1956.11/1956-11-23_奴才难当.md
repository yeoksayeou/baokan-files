　　It's Hard to Be a Lackey

　　After Britain and France launched an armed adventure in the Middle East, the U.S. government took the opportunity to create war hysteria in the Far East. It ordered U.S. troops stationed in the Taiwan Strait and elsewhere to enter a state of "alert," and transferred a U.S. fleet from the Western Hemisphere to the Western Pacific. Seeing this situation, Syngman Rhee, who always acted according to his master's wishes, also wagged his tail. He quickly announced that all of South Korea's armed forces had been ordered to emergency alert and tried to exaggerate the tension as much as possible. On the 14th, he fabricated the rumor in a serious manner that North Korea had recently "detonated several bombs." His subordinates, in order to cater to his wishes, further explained: "Evidence shows that North Korea tested two atomic bombs."

　　Unexpectedly, this time the Syngman Rhee group shouted vigorously but ran into a wall. According to a report by United Press International on the same day, some U.S. military generals in the Far East said that they had no knowledge of any evidence proving that "atomic weapons had been tested in North Korea."

　　Obviously, the American boss did not fail to appreciate Syngman Rhee's service, but just felt that he was lying too much. "Atomic explosions" should not be fabricated casually, because scientific institutions in various countries can judge their authenticity. It doesn't matter if Syngman Rhee makes a fool of himself, but it also exposes his master's trick of creating tension out of thin air. It is no wonder that Syngman Rhee did not gain favor, but instead suffered a rebuff. Syngman Rhee's experience shows that it is not easy for a lackey to fully meet the requirements of his master.

    奴才难当
    英法在中东发动武装冒险之后，美国政府也趁此机会在远东制造战争歇斯底里。它下令驻在台湾海峡等处的美国部队进入“戒备状态”，又从西半球把一支美国舰队调到西太平洋。看到这种情形，一向看主子眼色行事的李承晚，也随着翘起了尾巴。他赶紧宣布，南朝鲜的全体武装部队已经奉命紧急戒备，并且尽量想把局势渲染得紧张一些。他在14日煞有介事地造谣说，北朝鲜最近“爆炸了几颗炸弹”。他的手下人为了迎合他的心意，更进一步解释道：“证据表明，北朝鲜试验了两次原子弹。”
    不料，这次李承晚集团叫得起劲，却碰了一鼻子的灰。据合众社同一天报道，一些在远东的美国军事将领都说，他们根本不知道有任何证据证明“在北朝鲜试验过原子武器。”
    显然，美国老板并非不赏识李承晚的效劳，只是嫌他撒谎撒得过了火。“原子爆炸”是不宜随便捏造的，因为各国的科学机构都能判断真伪。李承晚闹一个笑话不打紧，却连带把他的主子凭空制造紧张局势的一套把戏都拆穿了。这就难怪李承晚没有讨到欢心，却讨了一个没趣。李承晚的遭遇说明，一个奴才要完全迎合它的主子的要求，可不是容易的事。（平）
