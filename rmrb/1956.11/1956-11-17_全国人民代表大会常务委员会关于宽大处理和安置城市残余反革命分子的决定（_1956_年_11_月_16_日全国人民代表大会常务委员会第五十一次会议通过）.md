The struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries in our country has now achieved a decisive victory, and the extremely small number of remaining counter-revolutionaries have become increasingly isolated and divided. In order to give the remaining counter-revolutionaries an opportunity to repent and start anew, further isolate and eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionaries, and mobilize all possible forces to participate in the country's socialist construction, the following decisions are now made on the lenient handling and resettlement of remaining counter-revolutionaries in cities:

I. For counter-revolutionaries who only committed general crimes before liberation, did not engage in sabotage activities after liberation, and are not greatly resented by the people, or for general counter-revolutionaries who, although they committed crimes after liberation, have now ceased their activities, all past wrongdoings shall be forgiven as long as they thoroughly confess their crimes.

II. Counter-revolutionaries who have not yet been brought to justice and who committed serious crimes before liberation and are greatly resented by the people, or counter-revolutionaries who have engaged in serious sabotage activities after liberation, should be called upon to quickly confess their crimes to the People's Government. Those counter-revolutionaries who thoroughly confess their crimes may be treated with leniency: those who deserve the death penalty shall be exempted from the death penalty; those who deserve imprisonment shall be given a lighter sentence or exempted from punishment; meritorious service may offset crimes, and great meritorious service shall be rewarded.

III. Counter-revolutionaries who have fled into the cities, whether they thoroughly confess their crimes on the spot or return to their original locations, shall be handled in accordance with the principle of leniency for confession. Those who are unwilling to return to their original locations for handling after confessing should be appropriately handled on the spot and should not be forced to return to their original locations.

IV. All those who are not prosecuted, exempted from criminal punishment, released after serving their sentences, and those who are under control, who already have fixed occupations, should be resettled according to their industries along with various socialist transformations. Those who have no occupation or no fixed occupation and no means of support shall be planned and arranged by the Municipal People's Committee in a unified manner according to the following methods: those who have no occupation and no means of support in the city, but have the conditions for production or means of support in the countryside, should be mobilized to return to their hometowns to participate in production; those who have no occupation and no means of support in the city, and no conditions for production or means of support in the countryside, but have the ability to work, should be organized to immigrate to produce or find employment locally; those who have lost the ability to work and have no means of support should be taken in for shelter and education. Intellectuals and those with certain specialized skills among these people should be appropriately arranged for work according to their abilities and specialties.

V. All those who are not prosecuted, exempted from criminal punishment, released after serving their sentences, and released from control shall have their status as counter-revolutionaries removed after they have been treated with leniency, or after they have been released from prison and released from control. When removing their status as counter-revolutionaries, it should be discussed and approved by the relevant people's masses and agreed upon by the district or city people's committee without districts, and it should be announced that they will no longer be regarded as counter-revolutionaries in the future, and according to their work or occupation, they can be correspondingly called workers, staff members, shop assistants, members, teachers, and state organ staff members, etc. The above-mentioned categories of people shall have their civil rights protected in accordance with the law. However, within a certain period of time, they shall not hold any important positions in factories, enterprises, organs, organizations, schools, etc.

VI. General members of reactionary organizations, and those who only held reactionary positions but did not actually commit counter-revolutionary crimes, should not be counted as counter-revolutionaries.

Those who revolted in the revolutionary war, even if they had participated in counter-revolutionary organizations in the past or committed counter-revolutionary crimes, should not be counted as counter-revolutionaries as long as they did not engage in counter-revolutionary activities after the revolt.

Former military and political personnel who had joined the People's Liberation Army and were demobilized and transferred to civilian work and sent home should not be regarded as counter-revolutionaries.

The above three categories of people should have the same opportunities for employment as the people's masses and should not be discriminated against.

VII. Those who have already been employed but are exempted from criminal punishment and those who are still under control should be given equal pay for equal work and given the wages they deserve.

VIII. The family members of counter-revolutionaries who have not participated in counter-revolutionary activities should have the same opportunities for employment and schooling as the people's masses and should not be discriminated against.

IX. Current counter-revolutionaries who engage in various sabotage activities should be punished according to law. Counter-revolutionaries who committed serious crimes before liberation and are greatly resented by the people, and counter-revolutionaries who have engaged in serious sabotage activities after liberation, who have not yet been brought to justice in the past but refuse to confess their crimes, should be punished according to law after verification. All counter-revolutionaries who continue to engage in sabotage activities after being treated with leniency shall be severely punished according to law.

    全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于宽大处理和安置城市残余反革命分子的决定
    （1956年11月16日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第五十一次会议通过）
    现在我国镇压反革命的斗争，已经取得了决定性的胜利，极少数残余的反革命分子已经日益孤立和分化。国家为了给予残余的反革命分子悔罪自新的机会，进一步孤立和肃清残余的反革命分子，动员一切可能动员的力量参加国家的社会主义建设，现在对城市残余反革命分子的宽大处理和安置办法作如下决定：
    一、对于解放前只有一般罪行，解放后没有进行破坏活动，民愤不大的反革命分子，或者解放后虽然曾经有过罪行，而现在已经停止活动的一般反革命分子，只要彻底坦白认罪，一概不咎既往。
    二、对于尚未归案法办的在解放前有严重罪行民愤很大的反革命分子，或者在解放后曾经有过严重破坏活动的反革命分子，应当号召他们迅速向人民政府坦白认罪。这些反革命分子中彻底坦白认罪的，可以从宽处理：罪当处死的，一律免处死刑；罪当判处徒刑的，从轻判刑或者免刑；立功的可以折罪，立大功的给予奖励。
    三、逃入城市的反革命分子，无论就地或者回原地彻底坦白认罪，都按坦白从宽的原则处理。坦白后不愿回原地处理的，应当就地作适当处理，不要强迫送回原地。
    四、凡是不予追究的分子、免予刑事处分的分子、刑满释放的分子和被管制的分子，已经有固定职业的，应当随着各项社会主义改造，按行业予以安置。没有职业或者没有固定职业、又没有生活依靠的，由市人民委员会按照下列办法有计划有步骤地进行统筹安排：在城市没有职业，没有生活依靠，在农村有生产条件或者有生活依靠的，应当动员他们回乡参加生产；在城市没有职业，没有生活依靠，在农村也没有生产条件，没有生活依靠，但有劳动能力的，应当组织移民生产或者在当地劳动就业；已丧失劳动能力而生活又无依靠的，应当予以收容教养。对于这类分子中的知识分子和有一定的专门技术的人，应当根据他们的能力和特长，适当安排他们的工作。
    五、凡是不予追究的分子、免予刑事处分的分子、刑满释放的分子和解除管制的分子，在对他们实行宽大处理以后，或者在刑满释放和解除管制以后，应当取消他们的反革命分子的身分。在取消他们的反革命分子身分的时候，应当经过有关的人民群众讨论通过和区或者不设区的市人民委员会同意，宣布今后不再以反革命分子看待，并且依照他们的工作或职业，可以相应地称为工人、职员、店员、社员、教员和国家机关工作人员等。上述各类分子，应当依法保障他们的公民权利。但是在一定时期内，都不得担任工厂、企业、机关、团体、学校等的任何重要职务。
    六、反动组织中的一般成员，以及仅有反动职位而确实没有反革命罪行的人，不应当算作反革命分子。
    在革命战争中起义的人员，纵然历史上曾经参加过反革命组织，或者有过反革命罪行，只要在起义后没有反革命活动，就不应当算作反革命分子。
    旧军政人员曾经参加人民解放军而复员转业资遣回家的更不应当以反革命分子看待。
    以上三类人员，应当和人民群众有同样劳动就业的机会，不得歧视。
    七、对于已经就业的免予刑事处分的分子和尚在被管制中的分子，应当实行同工同酬的原则，给他们以应得的工资。
    八、反革命分子的家属凡是没有参予反革命活动的，应当和人民群众有同样的就业、就学的机会，不得歧视。
    九、对于进行各种破坏活动的现行反革命分子，应当依法惩办。对于在解放前有严重罪行民愤很大的反革命分子，对于在解放后曾经有过严重破坏活动的反革命分子，凡是过去尚未归案法办而又拒不坦白认罪的，经过查证确实，应当依法惩办。对于一切经过宽大处理后仍然继续进行破坏活动的反革命分子，应当依法从严惩办。
