Unite Around the Party
Statement by the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain

The enemies of the working class and the millionaire newspapers are currently launching a fierce attack on the Communist Party. They do so not out of concern for the British workers, the Hungarian workers, the Egyptian workers, or ordinary people anywhere in the world.

They attack the Communist Party because they see it as the most active fighter defending the interests of the working class and socialism. While the Labour Party was still hesitatingly giving formal support to the initial military actions, the Communist Party led the struggle against the Anglo-French aggression in Suez.

It constantly leads every heroic labor struggle and fights for tenants to unite against rent increases. It fights for the labor movement to unite against conservatism. It is faithful to the principles of working-class internationalism.

Today, despite the roaring of the capitalist newspapers, it tells the people the truth about the conspiracies and activities of fascists and counter-revolutionaries inside and outside Hungary. These fascists and counter-revolutionaries, supported by the British millionaire newspaper magnates, are trying to use the legitimate demands of the Hungarian people to restore fascism in Hungary.

The Communist Party will never be bought, defeated, silenced, or intimidated. It will never give up the struggle against capitalism and imperialism. It will never cease its struggle for peace and socialism. All members of our Party will unite around the Party, help strengthen the Party, to answer this attack by the class enemy.

Some comrades have left the Party in the face of current difficulties. But the vast majority of Party members are unwavering. We believe that those who have left the Party have made a big mistake; as things develop, many of them will deeply regret that they took this step instead of staying in the Party and presenting their views to their Party organization.

Of course, the Conservatives and the traditional enemies of the working class are greatly pleased by these people leaving the Communist Party. But anyone who thinks that the result will be that our Party loses its fighting power is making the biggest mistake of their life.

Because of the work our Party is doing and the discussions taking place among our members, our Party will be strengthened on the basis of firm belief, and the unity of the Party will be consolidated.

The capitalist newspapers do not report how, in Party congresses held across the country, Party members, in free and open voting, have shown that an overwhelming majority support the policies of the Executive Committee and the policies of the international communist movement, and support maintaining unity in the struggle against fascism and in defending the cause of socialism and peace.

Unite to fight back against the enemy's attack!
Unite to build and strengthen the Communist Party! (Originally published in the "Daily Worker," London, November 16)

    团结在党的周围
    英国共产党执行委员会的声明
    工人阶级的敌人以及百万富翁的报纸目前正在对共产党进行一次猛烈的进攻。他们这样做并不是出于对英国工人、匈牙利工人、埃及工人或者世界上任何地方的普通人民的关心。
    他们所以进攻共产党，是因为他们看到共产党是维护工人阶级和社会主义的利益的最积极的战士。当工党还在对最初的军事行动迟疑地给予正式支持的时候，共产党就领导反对英法在苏伊士进行侵略的斗争。
    它不断地领导每一个英勇的劳资斗争并且为房客团结一致反对增加房租而斗争。它为劳工运动团结一致反对保守主义而斗争。它忠于工人阶级国际主义的原则。
    今天尽管资本家的报纸咆哮一通，它把匈牙利国内外的法西斯分子和反革命分子的阴谋和活动的真相告诉人民。这些法西斯分子和反革命分子得到英国百万富翁报纸大王的支持并且试图利用匈牙利人民的正当要求使法西斯主义在匈牙利复辟。
    共产党是决不会被收买、被打倒、被封住口或者被吓倒的。它决不会放弃对资本主义和帝国主义的斗争。它决不会停止为和平和社会主义而进行的斗争。我们党的全体党员将团结在党的周围，帮助加强党，来回答阶级敌人的这个进攻。
    有些同志在目前困难的情况下退出了党。但是极大部分党员是坚定不移的。我们认为那些已经退出党的人这样做是大错特错的；随着事态的发展，他们当中有许多人会深深后悔他们当初走了这一步而没有留在党内，向他们的党的组织提出他们的观点。
    当然，保守党人以及工人阶级的传统敌人对于这些人的退出共产党感到莫大的高兴。但是，谁以为结果会使我们的党失去战斗力谁就犯了他生平以来最大的错误。
    由于我们的党在进行的工作以及我们党员中在进行的讨论，我们党将会在坚决信仰的基础上得到加强，党的团结将得到巩固。
    资本家的报纸并不报道，在全国各地举行的党员大会上，党员们如何在自由和公开的投票中表明压倒多数的人支持执行委员会的政策和国际共产主义运动的政策，支持在反对法西斯主义和维护社会主义和和平事业的斗争中保持团结一致。
    团结起来为打退敌人的进攻而斗争！
    团结起来来建设和加强共产党！（原载11月16日伦敦“工人日报”）
