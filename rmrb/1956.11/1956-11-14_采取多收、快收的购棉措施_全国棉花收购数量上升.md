    Adopting Measures to Collect More and Collect Quickly
    National Cotton Purchase Quantity Rises
    Xinhua News Agency, November 11th. Recently, after the agricultural product purchasing agencies in various cotton-producing areas adopted measures to collect more and collect quickly, the quantity of cotton purchased has significantly increased. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agricultural Products Procurement, the national cotton purchase quantity in late October increased by 36% compared to mid-October.
    In the previous period, some agricultural cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas, for the purpose of seed selection, seed preservation, and carrying out cotton ginning sideline production, picked cotton but did not sell it. In response to this situation, agricultural product purchasing agencies in various regions adopted various effective measures. The agricultural product purchasing agencies in Shandong Province required agricultural cooperatives with ginning capacity to quickly process and sell lint cotton, and at the same time mobilized agricultural cooperatives without ginning tools and ginning technology to sell seed cotton or hand over seed cotton to ginning factories for processing and return of cotton seeds. The cotton purchase quantity in this province in late October increased by 15% compared to mid-October. Many places in Hebei Province adopted the method of agricultural cooperatives selling seed cotton and purchasing stations supplying corresponding grades of cotton seeds, which was welcomed by farmers. Some agricultural cooperatives in Chengguan District, Wuqiao County, had poor ginning technology and low cotton quality after processing; the purchasing stations used detailed accounting methods to explain that this was unfavorable to the country and the agricultural cooperatives, and mobilized the agricultural cooperatives to sell seed cotton. Twenty-three agricultural cooperatives therefore changed their original processing plans and actively sold seed cotton. Purchasing stations in Anyang, Xinye and other counties in Henan Province helped agricultural cooperatives improve ginning technology, increasing output by one time and improving quality by one grade, thereby increasing the purchase volume. The agricultural product purchasing agencies of each county in Xiaogan Prefecture, Hubei Province, sent liaison officers to various agricultural cooperatives to understand the cotton sales situation, and mobilized the agricultural cooperatives to sell cotton, which also achieved good results.

    采取多收、快收的购棉措施
    全国棉花收购数量上升
    新华社11日讯　最近各产棉区的农产品采购机构采取多收、快收的措施以后，棉花收购数量显著上升。据农产品采购部统计，10月下旬全国棉花收购数量比中旬上升36％。
    前一时期，各产棉区有些农业社为了选种、保种和开展轧花副业生产，摘下棉花不卖。针对这一情况，各地农产品采购机构便采取了各种有效措施。山东省农产品采购机构要求有轧花力量的农业社赶快加工出售皮棉，同时动员没有轧花工具和轧花技术的农业社出售籽棉或把籽棉交轧花厂加工收回棉籽。这个省10月下旬的棉花收购数量就比中旬上升15％。河北省许多地方采取农业社出售籽棉、采购站供应相应等级的棉籽的办法，受到农民的欢迎。吴桥县城关区有些农业社轧花技术不高，加工后棉花质量低；采购站便用算细账的办法，说明这样对国家、对农业社都是不利的，并且动员农业社出售籽棉。有二十三个农业社因而改变了原来加工的计划，积极出售了籽棉。河南省安阳、新野等县采购站帮助农业社改进轧花技术，使产量提高一倍，品质提高一级，因而增加了收购量。湖北省孝感专区各县农产品采购机构派连络员到各农业社了解售棉情况，并且动员农业社售棉，也收到良好的效果。
