Breaking Down the “Ritual” Barriers Between Men and Women
——Anecdotes from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Student Days
	Luo Jiqun

Sun Yat-sen, "from the year of Yiyou when China was defeated in the Sino-French War (1885), resolved to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish the Republic of China. From then on, he used the school as a place to promote his ideas and medicine as a means to enter society" (Sun Yat-sen's Autobiography). When he was twenty-one years old and studying at the Guangzhou Boji Medical School, there were already male and female students studying together, but they sat on the left and right sides, separated by a curtain. One day, when examining gynecology cases, teachers routinely led students in clinical practice, but only foreign students were allowed to participate, not Chinese students. Sun Yat-sen was very angry and went to the principal's office. The principal was an American named John Glasgow Kerr, the father of Dr. Kerr, who had long been a professor at the former Lingnan University. The principal asked why, and Sun Yat-sen said: We are all students, why discriminate against us Chinese and not allow us to participate in gynecology practice? The principal said: You Chinese have always had "men and women not touching hands when giving or receiving things" and "ritual" barriers, but we Americans don't need to be bound by this. Sun Yat-sen said: Is learning medicine for the purpose of treating diseases and saving people? The principal had to say yes. Sun Yat-sen said: Then is it not the purpose of Chinese students learning medicine to treat diseases and save people? If Chinese women are sick, can't Chinese doctors save them? Which is more important, saving lives or unreasonable “ritual”? The principal had nothing more to say to refute him. From then on, the rule that Chinese students were not allowed to see gynecology cases was broken, and the curtain separating men and women in the classroom was soon removed. From this incident, it can be seen that Sun Yat-sen was revolutionary even in his youth.

Also, Sun Yat-sen's original name was Rixin, taken from the inscription on Tang's washbasin in the Great Learning: "If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation." After arriving at medical school, his teacher Mr. Qu Fengzhi gave him the alias Yixian, and from then on, this name spread throughout the world. Later, Boji Medical School was also renamed Sun Yat-sen Memorial School. As for the name Zhongshan, it was an abbreviation of "Zhongshan Qiao," which he used when he took refuge in Japan after the failure of the revolution.

The above anecdote about Sun Yat-sen was heard from Dr. Liu Qianyi, a classmate one term after Sun Yat-sen. Dr. Liu is five years younger than Sun Yat-sen, now eighty-five years old, and still in good health. Although he originally studied Western medicine, he later became proficient in traditional Chinese medicine and wrote "Categorized Materia Medica Songs" and "Textual Research on Ancient and Modern Different Names of Plants," etc.

    打破男女“礼教”之防
    ——孙中山先生学生时代逸事
    罗冀群
    孙中山“自乙酉中法战败之年（1885），始决倾复清廷创建民国之志。由是以学堂为鼓吹之地，借医术为入世之媒”（中山自传）。当他二十一岁肄业广州博济医学校的时候，已有男女学生同学，但分左右座，并且挂一个帐幔隔开。一天，诊察妇科，照例由教师带领学生临床实习，但只许外国学生实习，而不许中国学生去。中山大愤，闹到校长室，校长是美国人嘉约翰，就是久任前岭南大学教授嘉惠霖医生的父亲。校长问故，中山说：同是学生，为什么歧视我中国人不许往妇科实习？校长道：你们中国人，向来“男女授受不亲”、有“礼教”之防，我们美国人则无须拘此。中山道：学医是否治病救人？校长只好说是。中山道：那么中国学生学医不是治病救人吗？中国妇女有病中国医生不能救吗？究竟救命为重？还是不合理的“礼教”为重？校长再也没有什么话可以难倒他。从此打破了中国学生不许看妇科之例，而教室所设隔别男女的帐幔不久也撤除了。从这事也可以看出中山青年时代便富于革命性。
    又中山原名日新，取大学汤盘铭“苟日新，日日新，又日新”之义。到了医学校后，老师区凤稚先生给他改号逸仙，从此这个名字便传遍了世界。后来博济医学校亦曾改名为孙逸仙纪念学校。至于中山之名，系革命失败避居日本时改名为“中山樵”的省略。
    上举中山逸事一则，是我从中山后一期的同学刘谦一医生处听到的。刘医生小中山五岁，现年八十五，而精神尚健，他虽原习西医而后精研中医，著有“中药分类药性歌”、“植物古今异名考证”等。
