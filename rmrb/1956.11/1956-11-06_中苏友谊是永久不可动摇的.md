Liaoning Province Combines Central Work to Promote Sino-Soviet Friendship
Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 5th. This year, the Liaoning Province and Shenyang City Sino-Soviet Friendship Association closely cooperated with central tasks such as the advanced producer movement, the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives, and the march towards science, to carry out publicity and education activities on Sino-Soviet friendship and the promotion of learning from the Soviet Union among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals.

	According to statistics for the first half of this year, the Liaoning Province and Shenyang City Sino-Soviet Friendship Association compiled and printed 1.31 million copies of materials promoting Sino-Soviet friendship for urban and rural areas, and held more than 200 exhibitions introducing Soviet construction achievements and promoting Sino-Soviet friendship in cultural centers, factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, and military units in Shenyang City, with a total audience of more than 290,000 people. In addition, Sino-Soviet friendship galleries, picture exhibition showcases, or exhibition boards were added in public places such as railway stations, bookstores, and cinemas to introduce Soviet construction achievements. Publicity on Sino-Soviet friendship was also carried out in various forms such as report meetings, literary lectures, story meetings, and sending out Sino-Soviet friendship publicity vehicles.

	This year, the Sino-Soviet friendship publicity of the Liaoning Province and Shenyang City Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was timely and closely coordinated with the central work in terms of content, and gradually deepened. For example, when the advanced producer movement began, the Stakhanov movement in the Soviet Union was introduced, and then what should be learned from it was introduced. After the movement was launched, the experience of the Khrisanova group in completing the plan on an hourly basis and other famous advanced producers in the Soviet Union were introduced in conjunction with the formulation of group plans. At the same time, according to the principle of socialist competition, the collectivist spirit of Soviet workers helping and learning from each other was introduced. Later, with the development of the movement, the experience of Soviet enterprises in handling rationalization proposals and running advanced producer schools, as well as the stories of Soviet workers caring about product quality and learning technology, were introduced.
