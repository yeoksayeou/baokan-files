Xinhua News Agency report: Following the genetics symposium held in Qingdao in August, the Xi'an branch of the Michurin Society recently held its first discussion on genetics issues. Teachers and scientific workers from various schools of thought participating in the discussion focused on the issue of the "material basis of heredity" and engaged in heated debate.

Professor Wen Honghan of the Plant Teaching and Research Group of the Agricultural Department believes that chromosomes may not be the only hereditary material, but they play a leading role in heredity. Wen Honghan divides matter into different categories, believing that inorganic nutrients do not have heredity; plastic substances have a certain degree of heredity; and protoplasm has strong heredity. He said that hereditary material is the product of the long-term interaction of organisms and the environment, and this material determines the heredity of the next generation, while it is still constantly changing.

Lecturer Wei Cong of the Animal Husbandry Teaching and Research Group disagrees with the "gene" theory of the Weismann-Morgan school, which states that gender is determined by chromosomes. He cited examples such as feeding tadpoles with frog meat, resulting in 92% of the offspring being female, to illustrate that animal gender is greatly affected by external conditions and vitality. Lecturer Gao Yongcheng of the Genetic Selection Teaching and Research Group believes that the Weismann-Morgan school has made achievements in accumulating data in genetics, but he also opposes the "gene" theory.

Professor Shi Shenghan of the Soil and Agricultural Chemistry Department raised three questions in his speech. First, is there a parallel relationship or a causal relationship between chromosomes and hereditary phenomena? Second, when chromosomes are changed through drastic changes, can the cytoplasm remain unaffected? Third, does the chromatin of chromosomes represent the hereditary properties of the chromosomes? This old professor, who studies plant physiology, hopes that everyone will help him solve these long-standing problems through free debate.

In addition to some teachers and students from Northwest Agricultural College, experts from the Northwest Agricultural Biology Research Institute and scientific and technical personnel from agricultural experiment stations in various provinces of Northwest China who were attending meetings in the area also participated in the discussion, totaling more than 400 people.

The Xi'an branch of the Michurin Society will continue to organize discussions on issues such as the material basis of heredity and the relationship between heredity and the environment.

### 米丘林学会西安分会  热烈讨论“遗传的物质基础”问题

    米丘林学会西安分会
    热烈讨论“遗传的物质基础”问题
    新华社讯　继八月间在青岛召开的遗传学座谈会后，米丘林学会西安分会最近也举行了关于遗传学问题的第一次讨论会。参加讨论会的各个学派的教师和科学工作者集中对“遗传的物质基础”这个问题展开了热烈的争论。
    农学系植物教研组闻洪汉教授的看法是：染色体可能不是唯一的遗传物质，但它在遗传上是起着主导作用。闻洪汉把物质分成不同的类别，他认为无机养料物质不具有遗传性；塑性物质具有一定的遗传性；原生质则具有强烈的遗传性。他说，遗传物质是长期以来生物和环境共同作用下的产物，这种物质决定着下一代遗传，而它仍在不停地变化。
    家畜饲养教研组讲师魏琮不同意魏斯曼、摩尔根学派的“基因”理论中认为性别决定于染色体的说法。他举出了用青蛙肉喂养蝌蚪，其后代92％都是雌的等例子，说明动物性别在很大程度上是受外界条件和生活力的影响。遗传选种教研组讲师高永成认为魏斯曼、摩尔根学派在遗传学积累资料等方面是有成绩的，但他也反对“基因”的理论。
    土壤农化系教授石声汉在发言中提出了三个问题。一、染色体和遗传现象是平行关系还是因果关系；二、通过剧烈变化，改变染色体时，细胞质能不能不受影响；三、染色体的染色质是不是即代表染色体的遗传性质。这位研究植物生理的老教授希望大家通过自由争辩，帮助他解决这几个三十年来长久不能解决的问题。
    参加这次讨论会的除西北农学院一部分教师和学生外，还有西北农业生物研究所的专家和正在当地开会的西北各省农业试验站的科学技术人员共四百多人。
    米丘林学会西安分会还将就遗传的物质基础、遗传和环境的关系等问题继续组织讨论。
