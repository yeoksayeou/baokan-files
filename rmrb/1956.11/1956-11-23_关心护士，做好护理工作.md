    Care for Nurses, Do a Good Job of Nursing
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    Nursing is a scientific and technical job that occupies an important position in medical and health undertakings. Nurses help doctors to properly complete medical tasks and enhance patients' self-healing ability to resist disease. Whatever the hospital, whatever the patient, nursing work is needed. Incorrect views of nurses should be changed, and nurses' labor should be respected.
    In order to further improve nursing work and give full play to the role of nurses, we must focus on the current situation of nursing work, continuously improve the scientific and technical level of nurses, care for the lives of nurses, and help nurses improve the quality of their work.
    Improving nursing work should start from these aspects.
    All medical institutions should improve the organization and leadership of nurses and related work systems. Are the staffing allocations of each hospital appropriate? Is the division of responsibilities among all practitioners clear? Are nurses playing their due role? All of these need to be carefully studied. In hospitals and wards, there are many things, such as making beds and receiving supplies, that nurses have to do. Some hospitals believe that the work of nurses is only general cleaning work, and they only evaluate the success of nursing work based on how well they do general cleaning work, such as whether the glass is wiped brightly or the floor is swept cleanly. This not only fails to encourage nurses to advance towards science but also reduces the scientific and technical level of nursing work. If hospitals correspondingly establish some junior nursing staff to mainly do general cleaning work, then nurses can get rid of general affairs, strive to improve the scientific and technical level of nursing work, and give greater play to their role.
    Doing a good job in training nurses and gradually improving the medical level of nurses is very important. After liberation, nurse education was set as an intermediate academic system, which could have adapted to the requirements of actual work. However, due to the lack of teachers, there are many problems in teaching materials and practice, and the quality of teaching cannot be guaranteed. Hospital nurse leaders generally also lack the leadership ability of professional technology. The professional and technical study of nurses in service has not attracted attention; coupled with improper use, the medical level and working ability of nurses are difficult to further improve. This naturally cannot satisfy their ambition to do a good job. Health and education departments should consider solving this fundamental problem. Starting from improving teachers and improving leading cadres, establish nurse training institutions, and train a group of senior nursing talents who can both teach and lead. The existing senior nursing talents should be properly arranged so that they can participate in nurse education and nursing technology research as much as possible. At present, we should also pay attention to running nurses' spare-time education to gradually enrich their scientific foundation. For the existing nursing staff with low scientific and technical levels, various effective methods should be used to further help them improve.
    Most of the nurses are young women. Medical and health departments should pay attention to taking care of the work characteristics and physiological characteristics of nurses, care for them in life, and provide them with various convenient conditions in work. However, there are still many medical and health departments that do not do well in this regard, lacking both education and care for them. Some places have set some extremely unreasonable systems for them, such as mothers having to make up the time spent breastfeeding outside of working hours; some hospitals also require nurses to lift patients, and even pregnant nurses cannot be exempted from this heavy labor. Learning scientific and technical knowledge is originally the right of nurses, but some hospitals have set some strange rules for nurses, such as nurses not even being able to participate in Pavlovian learning. How can this be said to be caring and loving? All medical departments should correct these incorrect practices, solve their practical problems in work and life, help them overcome various difficulties, encourage their enthusiasm for work, and settle down in the nursing profession.
    Nursing work has a large scope of relations in the hospital and involves all organizational management work and patient education work. In order to do a good job in nursing, the hospital should have a unified leadership organization to study and guide the overall nursing work at any time to strengthen the business and technical leadership of nursing work. Nurses in various medical departments should still respect the leadership of doctors. Doctors should also care for nurses, help them improve their medical level, and guide their work so that they can better cooperate with medical work and serve as close assistants to doctors.
    Nurses are a large contingent of intellectuals and an important profession for women to participate in social construction. The Chinese Nursing Association is an academic and mass organization of nurses. All trade unions, women's organizations, youth organizations, and relevant academic organizations should care about it and drive it, and the health administrative departments should support it, implement the Party's policy towards intellectuals, oppose the erroneous idea of ​​discriminating against women's occupations, so that this organization can unite all nursing staff, organize self-education, and exchange scientific and technical work experience, and play a greater administrative assistant role.
    In order to give full play to the role of nurses and do a good job in nursing, all relevant parties should actively improve their work and oppose taking a bureaucratic attitude.

    关心护士，做好护理工作
    本报评论员
    护理工作是一项科学技术工作，在医疗卫生事业中占有重要的地位。护士帮助医师妥善地完成医疗任务；增强病人的自愈能力，抵抗疾病。无论什么样的医院，什么样的病人都需要护理工作。对护士的不正确的看法应该改变，护士的劳动应当受到尊重。
    为了进一步做好护理工作，充分发挥护士的作用，就要针对目前护士工作的情况，不断提高护士的科学技术水平，关心护士的生活，帮助护士提高工作质量。
    改进护士工作，要从这些方面来着手。
    各医疗机构要改进对护士的组织领导和有关的工作制度。各医院人员编制配备是否合宜？各从业人员的职责分工是否明确？护士是否发挥了应有的作用？都要好好研究。医院、病房有许多事情，像铺床、领物，等等，都要护士来做。有的医院认为护士的工作只是一般的清洁工作，只根据她们的一般清洁工作做得好丑，如玻璃拭得亮不亮，地扫得干净不干净，来评定护理工作的成绩。这样，不仅不能鼓励护士向科学进军，反而降低了护理工作的科学技术水平。医院如果相应地编制一些初级的护理人员，让他们来主要做一般清洁工作。那末，护士就可以摆脱一般事务，努力提高护理工作的科学技术水平，发挥她们更大的作用。
    做好培养护士的工作，逐步提高护士的医学水平是很重要的。解放以后，护士教育定为中级学制，本来可以适应实际工作的要求。但是，由于师资缺乏，在教材和实习方面都有很多问题，教学质量不能得到保证。医院的护士领导人员，一般也缺乏业务技术的领导能力。在职护士的业务技术学习也没有引起重视；再加上使用不当，以致护士的医学水平和工作能力很难进一步提高。这就很自然地不能满足她们希望做好工作的上进心。卫生、教育部门应当考虑解决这个根本性的问题。从提高师资和提高领导干部着手，建立护士的进修机构，培养一批既能担任教学，又能担任领导工作的高级护理人才。对于现有的高级护理人才应该妥善地安排，尽量使他们能参加护士教育工作和护理技术的研究工作。目前还应该重视举办护士的业余教育，以逐步充实她们的科学基础。对于现有的科学技术水平不高的护理人员，要用各种有效办法，进一步帮助她们提高。
    护士大部分是青年妇女。医疗卫生部门要注意照顾护士的工作特点和生理特点，在生活上关心她们，在工作上给以各种方便条件。可是现在还有许多医疗卫生部门在这一点上做得很不好，对她们既缺乏教育，又缺乏照顾。有的地方却为她们定了些极不合理的制度，如母亲因为哺乳花费的时间，要在工作时间以外补足；也有的医院要护士抬病人，甚至怀孕的护士也不能减免这项笨重的劳动。学习科学技术知识，本来是护士应有的权利，可是有的医院对护士却订了一些奇怪的规矩，如护士连巴甫洛夫学说学习都不能参加。这怎么能说得上关心爱护呢？各医疗部门应该纠正这些不正确的作法，解决她们工作上、生活上的实际问题，帮助她们克服各种困难，鼓舞她们的工作积极性，安心于护士职业。
    护理工作在医院中关系面大，又涉及一切组织管理工作和教育病人工作。为了做好护理工作，医院应该有个统一领导的专门组织，随时研究指导全面的护理工作，以加强护理工作的业务和技术领导。护士在各医疗科室，仍要尊重医师的领导。医师也应该爱护护士，帮助她们提高医学水平，指导她们工作，使她们更好地配合医疗工作，作为医师的亲密助手。
    护士是一支很大的知识分子队伍，是妇女参加社会建设的一项重要职业。中华护士学会是护士的学术性和群众性的组织。各工会、妇女、青年组织和有关各学术组织，都要关怀它，带动它，卫生行政部门更要支持它，贯彻执行党对知识分子的政策，反对歧视妇女职业的错误思想，使这个组织在团结全体护理人员，组织自我教育和交流科学技术工作经验上，发挥更大的行政助手作用。
    为了充分发挥护士的作用，把护理工作做好，各有关方面应该积极改进工作，反对采取官僚主义态度。
