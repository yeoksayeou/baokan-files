Title: Making a Steamer from Winter Melon

I suddenly thought of a familiar story: One cold winter night, the moon was faint and the stars were sparse, two people, A and B, were walking. A suddenly shouted, "There's a snake!" B immediately echoed, "Hey! It's still moving!"

"Oh! It's just a straw hat ring."

"I said, how could there be snakes in winter!"

Although this is a joke, if we pay a little attention in our real lives, it is not difficult to find people of B's type. If others say it's hot, he says it's very hot; if others say it's cold, he says it's freezing cold. Without any personal opinions, simply trying to please. Of course, this kind of person is not always like this to everyone, but depends on the person—especially when superiors are speaking. If the superior asks him, "Maybe a steamer can be made from winter melon?"

"It can be made!" He would answer without hesitation.

"What if it falls apart while steaming?"

"Then how could I be responsible?"

    东瓜做甑子
    唐昌
    我忽然想到这么一个为大家所熟悉的故事：一个严冬的夜晚，月淡星稀，甲乙二人行路。甲忽然大声叫喊：“有蛇。”乙马上接着应声：“嗨哟！还在动！”
    “哟！原来是草帽子圈圈。”
    “我也说冬天哪来的蛇呀！”
    这虽然是一则笑话，但只要在我们现实生活中稍加注意，是不难发现像乙这种类型的人的。别人说烫，他便说挺烫；别人说冷，他便说冰冷。毫无己见，一味讨好。自然这种人也不是逢人都是这样，而是要看人——特别是上级说话。如果上级这样问他：“也许东瓜做得甑子吧？”
    “做得！”他决不迟疑的答应。
    “蒸垮了呢？”
    “那我怎能负责呢。”
