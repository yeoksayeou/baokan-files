Xinhua News Agency, 2nd November. Egyptian Ambassador to China, Ragab, said today that he believes victory is on the side of the Egyptian people, and the victory of the Egyptian people's struggle is also the victory of the people of Asian and African countries.

Ambassador Ragab's remarks were made to a group of reporters at the embassy this morning. As he spoke, large numbers of marching people supporting the Egyptian people's struggle to safeguard their sovereignty were passing outside the embassy. People shouted: "Protest against Anglo-French aggression against Egypt!" "We resolutely support the Egyptian people!"

Ambassador Ragab told reporters: "In the past few days, I have received many letters from the Chinese people, and today the people of Beijing held a parade and demonstration against Anglo-French imperialist aggression and in support of the Egyptian people's just struggle, which makes me very grateful. On behalf of the Egyptian people, I thank the Chinese people.

He said: "We fully understand this action of the Chinese people, because China has also been oppressed by imperialism. The Chinese people have achieved victory with a firm stand, and we, like you, also have a firm stand. I believe that our position will also be supported by all Asian and African countries."

    感谢中国人民支持埃及的斗争
    新华社2日讯　埃及驻中国大使拉加布今天说，我相信胜利是在埃及人民一边，埃及人民斗争的胜利，也就是亚非各国人民的胜利。
    拉加布大使的谈话是今天上午在大使馆内对一群记者讲的。在他发表谈话的时候，大使馆外面正通过着大批支援埃及人民维护主权斗争的游行队伍。人们高呼：“抗议英法侵略埃及！”“我们坚决支持埃及人民！”
    拉加布大使对记者说：“最近几天来，我收到中国人民的许多来信，今天北京人民又举行了反对英法帝国主义侵略、支援埃及人民正义斗争的游行示威，使我非常感激。我以埃及人民的名义感谢中国人民。
    他说：“中国人民的这种行动，我们非常了解，因为中国同样曾经受过帝国主义的压迫。中国人民以坚定的立场，获得了胜利，我们同你们一样也有坚定的立场，我相信我们的立场同样会得到所有亚非国家的支持”。
