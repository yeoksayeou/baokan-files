Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao. The Qingdao Alginate Factory officially started construction on the 18th. The factory buildings utilize idle old factory buildings, and most of the machinery and equipment were transferred and renovated from idle machines of various factories under the Qingdao Municipal Bureau of Light Industry. The total investment in the construction is about 370,000 yuan. The entire project is divided into two phases. The first phase will be completed by the end of this year and will be put into production in the first quarter of next year. The second phase will be completed by the end of next year. After the entire factory is completed, the produced alginate will not only basically meet the needs of the national dyeing and printing industry for sizing materials, but also use a small portion of the higher quality products to supply hospitals as elastic impression materials for dentures.

Alginate is extracted from Sargassum in shallow seas. It is estimated that this type of Sargassum is produced in large quantities along the northern coast of our country, with an estimated annual output of no less than 2,000 tons.

Experiments have proven that alginate is the best sizing material for preparing color pastes for printing and dyeing calico. It is convenient to use as a printing paste, saves grain sizing materials, and has advantages such as good uniformity and easy washing. According to the current annual output of calico in the country, if alginate is used to prepare the color paste, 14 million jin of grain can be saved. In addition, alginate is also one of the best sizing materials for silk factories.

    马尾藻造胶的工厂
    新华社青岛电　青岛褐藻胶工厂18日正式开工兴建。这个厂的厂房利用了闲置的旧厂房，机器设备大部分也是由青岛市轻工业局所属各厂闲置的机器中调用改造成的。建厂投资总额三十七万元左右。全部工程分为两期进行，第一期工程在今年年底完工，明年第一季度就能投入生产；第二期工程将在明年年底以前全部完成。这个厂全部建成以后，所产褐藻胶除了基本上能满足全国印染业需要的糊料以外，还可以用一小部分质量较高的产品供应医院作为镶牙用的弹性印模材料。
    褐藻胶是从浅海里的马尾藻中提炼出来的。据估计，这种马尾藻在我国北部沿海一带大量出产，大约年产量不下两千吨。
    据实验证明，褐藻胶是调制印染花色布色浆的最好浆料。用它做印花浆料使用方便，能节约粮食浆料，而且还有均匀度好、水洗容易等优点。按全国目前花布年产量计算，如果全部使用褐藻胶来调制色浆，可以节约一千四百万斤粮食。此外，褐藻胶也是丝织厂的一种最好的浆料。
