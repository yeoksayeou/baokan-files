    Commemorating the Ninetieth Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth
    Chen Shutong
    His ordeal in London was known to the world,
    He dedicated himself to revolution through hardships and dangers;
    Failure has always been the mother of success,
    Finally, he learned from aligning with Russia.
    Liberation and a new beginning mark a new era,
    His spirit in the afterlife is comforted;
    Taiwan and Penghu's persistence remains a regret,
    They misuse the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun.
    Ninety years of existence are not so strange,
    The dragon and snake's misfortune is a common sorrow of the past;
    The publication of his selected works will spread far and wide,
    Surpassing the myriad praises of the world.
    I first saw his heroic figure in Jinhui,
    Fifty years have passed;
    His immortal spirit is now seen as in the past,
    His two mausoleums stand tall forever, north and south.

    纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年
    陈叔通
    蒙难伦敦世所知，
    献身革命历艰危；
    从来失败成功母，
    最后联俄自得师。
    解放开新是划时，
    九原含笑慰心期；
    台澎嵎负仍遗憾，
    盗用青天白日旗。
    九秩生存未足奇，
    龙蛇运厄古同悲；
    刊行选集流传远，
    犹胜人间万口碑。
    锦辉始面仰英姿，
    五十年来岁月驰；
    不死精神今视昔，
    二陵南北永崔峗。
