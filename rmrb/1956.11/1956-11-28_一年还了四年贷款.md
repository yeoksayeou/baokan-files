    One Year Pays Off Four Years of Loans
    Members of the Puqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanling County, Anhui Province, repaid the bank loans they had owed for four years in their first year of joining the cooperative. Since the autumn harvest, the Puqiao Township Credit Cooperative has been receiving farmers repaying loans from morning till night. More than 8,000 yuan in loans have now been recovered, 80% of which were livelihood loans made to farmers over the past four years.
    A large area of the Puqiao Agricultural Cooperative is often subject to waterlogging disasters. After it was upgraded to a high-level cooperative this year, more than 14,000 mu of double-cropping rice were planted, and all kinds of crops were carefully cultivated. Although some land was still flooded this year, the total grain output still increased by 30% compared with last year. More than 90% of the members have increased their income. Last year, 20% of households lacked grain, but now those households are either surplus grain households or self-sufficient households. Therefore, after the bumper harvest, the members enthusiastically repaid their loans, and after selling the surplus grain, they also deposited more than 8,000 yuan in deposits with the credit cooperative.

    一年还了四年贷款
    安徽省南陵县蒲礄农业生产合作社的社员，入社第一年就偿还了积欠四年的银行贷款。秋收以来，蒲礄乡信用社每天从早到晚都接待着还贷款的农民。现在已收回贷款八千多元，其中有80％都是四年来贷给农民的生活贷款。
    蒲礄农业社有一大片地区经常遭受水涝灾害，今年建成高级社后，改种了一万四千多亩双季稻，对各种农作物都做到了精耕细作，虽然今年仍有部分土地受淹，但粮食总产量仍比去年增加了30％。90％以上的社员都增加了收入。去年有20％的缺粮户，现在缺粮户都成了余粮户或自给户。因此丰收后社员踊跃交还贷款，并且在出售余粮以后还向信用社存了八千多元的存款。　　　　　　　　（新华社）
