By our correspondent Pan Fei, London, November 9th, urgent cable: "Those who play with fire will get burned," this saying fully applies to the British government, which is reaping the fruits of the war of aggression it launched. Since Nutting's resignation, a political crisis has erupted within the Conservative Party, and more people are leaving the Eden government and the Conservative Party.

On November 8th, Sir Edward Boyle, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, also announced his resignation. He said: "As a minister, I do not think I can conscientiously defend the government's recent policies."

Conservative Member of Parliament Carol Mather Banks said that he would remain in the House of Commons as an independent member and would no longer submit to the Conservative Party's reckless orders. Seven other Conservative MPs have publicly announced that they strongly disagree with the government's aggressive policies. Sir Frank Medlicott warned Eden in the House of Commons yesterday that he would no longer support the government unless it agreed to withdraw from Egypt immediately.

British newspapers revealed that since the start of the war of aggression, there have been rumors of serious divisions and conflicts within the Conservative ruling group. It is said that at the cabinet meeting on Monday, some ministers, led by Butler, threatened to oppose Eden's war actions, which almost led to the collapse of the Conservative government.

Eden and his followers pinned their policies on the illusion of a lightning-fast occupation of the Canal Zone, but the opposite has happened. They underestimated Egypt's resolute resistance and the indignation of almost the entire world (including the British people). The aggressors are isolated. The political ties that bind the Commonwealth have been strained to the breaking point. The cessation of traffic through the Suez Canal and the interruption of Middle East oil supplies have presented a series of problems for the British economy, such as a 15% to 20% increase in transportation costs. All of this, of course, cannot but affect the mood of some capitalists. Therefore, rumors about Eden's resignation are rampant.

    英保守党政府政治危机加深
    反对艾登侵略政策的人越来越多
    继纳丁之后财政部经济次官辞职
    本报记者潘非伦敦9日急电  “玩火者将自食其果”这句话完全适用于英国政府，它正在收获它所发动的侵略战争的果实。从纳丁辞职的时候起，保守党内部就迸发了一个政治危机，更多的人相继退出艾登政府和保守党。
    11月8日，财政部经济次官爱华德·波伊尔爵士也宣布辞职。他说：“作为一个部长，我不认为可以心安理得地为政府最近的政策作辩护。”
    保守党议员卡罗·雅尔·班克斯说，他将以独立议员身份留在下议院里，不再屈服保守党的乱命。另有七个保守党议员公开宣布，他们极不同意政府的侵略政策。法兰克·米达里考特爵士昨天在下院里警告艾登说，除非政府同意立即从埃及撤退，否则他不再支持政府了。
    英国报纸透露，从侵略战争发动之日起，一直就传说着在保守党统治集团内有严重的分歧和冲突。据说，在星期一的内阁会议上，以巴特勒为首的一些大臣们声言要反对艾登的战争行为，这使得保守党政府几乎陷于瓦解。
    艾登和他的追随者把他们的政策寄托在闪电式占领运河地区的幻想上面，但事实正好相反。他们估计不到埃及的坚决抵抗，和几乎是全世界（包括英国人民在内）的愤慨。侵略者孤立了。维系着联邦帝国的政治纽结已经紧张到破裂的地步。苏伊士运河的交通停顿、中东石油供应的中断，向英国经济提出了一系列的难题，例如，运输费上涨了15％到20％。这一切当然也不能不影响着一部分资本家的情绪。因此，关于艾登下野的谣传正嚣尘上。
