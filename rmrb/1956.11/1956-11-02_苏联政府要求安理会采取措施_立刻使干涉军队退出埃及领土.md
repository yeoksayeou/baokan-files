Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 31st: The Soviet government issued a statement regarding the armed aggression against Egypt.
The full text of the statement reads:
    Egypt has been invaded. British, French, and Israeli troops have invaded its territory.
    On the night of October 29th, Israeli troops crossed the Egyptian border and began military operations, advancing along the Sinai Peninsula towards the Suez Canal.
    The actions of the Israeli government are acts of armed aggression and a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter. The facts show that the Israeli invasion is clearly intended to create a pretext for Western countries, especially Britain and France, to send their troops into Arab countries, particularly the Suez Canal area.
    The Western countries are using the 1950 tripartite declaration of the United States, Britain, and France, a declaration unanimously opposed by all Arab countries, to mask their acts of aggression. The Israeli government has become a tool in the hands of the imperialist bloc attempting to restore the colonialist system of oppression in the East. It has issued a challenge to the entire Arab people and to the people of Eastern countries fighting against colonialism. The path taken by the extremist ruling group in Israel is a criminal and dangerous path, first and foremost for Israel itself and its future.
    Following the Israeli armed invasion, the British and French governments immediately issued an ultimatum to Egypt on October 30th, demanding that the key areas of Suez, Port Said, and Ismailia on Egyptian territory be handed over to their troops, supposedly to stop the military actions of Israel and Egypt. The Egyptian government refused this demand in order to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Nevertheless, Britain and France sent troops into Egyptian territory. In this way, the British and French governments embarked on the path of armed intervention in Egypt, grossly trampling on the legitimate rights of the sovereign state of Egypt.
    Such actions by the British and French governments are incompatible with the principles and purposes of the United Nations, a gross violation of the obligations they solemnly undertook as members of the United Nations, and an aggression against the Egyptian state.
    The Soviet government strongly condemns the aggressive actions of the British, French, and Israeli governments against Egypt. The freedom-loving people of all countries in the world wholeheartedly sympathize with the just struggle of the Egyptian people to safeguard their national independence.
    The Soviet government believes that, in order to maintain peace and security in the Near and Middle East, the United Nations Security Council should immediately take measures to stop the armed intervention of Britain, France, and Israel in Egypt and to immediately withdraw their interventionist troops from Egyptian territory.
    The Soviet government believes that the entire responsibility for the dangerous consequences arising from the aforementioned acts of aggression against Egypt rests entirely with the governments that undermine peace and security and carry out aggression.

### 苏联政府要求安理会采取措施  立刻使干涉军队退出埃及领土

    苏联政府要求安理会采取措施
    立刻使干涉军队退出埃及领土
    新华社1日讯　塔斯社莫斯科10月31日讯：苏联政府发表了关于埃及遭到武装侵略的声明。
    声明的全文说：
    埃及遭到了侵略。英国、法国和以色列的军队侵入了它的领土。
    10月29日夜，以色列军队越过埃及疆界，开始军事行动，沿着西奈半岛向苏伊士运河推进。
    以色列政府的行动是武装侵略行动，是公开破坏联合国宪章。事实表明，以色列的入侵显然是想造成一个借口，使西方国家、首先是英、法两国把自己的军队开到阿拉伯国家境内，特别是开到苏伊士运河地区。
    西方国家用来掩饰它们的侵略行动的是1950年美、英、法三国发表的殖民主义的宣言，这个宣言是所有阿拉伯国家一致反对的。以色列政府充当了企图在东方恢复殖民主义压迫制度的帝国主义集团手中的工具，它向全体阿拉伯人民，向为反对殖民主义而奋斗的东方各国人民发出了挑战。以色列极端主义的统治集团所走的道路首先对以色列本国来说，对它的前途来说，是一条罪恶的、危险的道路。
    继以色列武装侵犯之后，英国和法国的政府紧接着在10月30日向埃及提出了最后通牒：把埃及领土上的要地苏伊士、塞得港和伊士美利亚交给它们的军队，据说这是为了制止以色列和埃及的军事行动。埃及政府为了捍卫自己主权和领土的完整，拒绝了这一要求。虽然如此，英国和法国还是出兵进入埃及领土。这样，英国和法国的政府就走上了武装干涉埃及的道路，粗暴地践踏了主权国家埃及的合法权利。
    英国和法国政府的这种行动同联合国的原则和宗旨是不相容的，是对它们作为联合国会员国庄严承担的义务的粗暴破坏，是对埃及国家的侵略。
    苏联政府坚决谴责英国、法国和以色列政府对埃及的侵略行动。世界爱好自由的各国人民衷心同情埃及人民维护自己民族独立的正义斗争。
    苏联政府认为，联合国安全理事会为了维持中近东地区的和平和安宁，应该立即采取措施制止英国、法国和以色列武装干涉埃及的行动，使它们的干涉军队立刻退出埃及领土。
    苏联政府认为，由于上述侵略埃及的行动而产生的危险后果的全部责任完全由破坏和平和安全、实行侵略的政府负担。
