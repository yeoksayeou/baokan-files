    More Than One Thousand and Sixty Days
    Wen Tianshen
    Since the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Large Rolling Mill started producing China's first batch of large-sized steel in late November 1953, more than one thousand and sixty days have passed until October. During this period, the factory's workers, under the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts, have mastered the production of forty-seven types of products, including technically complex heavy rails, angle steel, channel steel, I-beams, and seamless steel tube billets. Heavy steel rails rolled by the Large Rolling Mill can be found on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, Baoji-Chengdu Railway, Jining-Erenhot Railway, Litang-Zhanjiang Railway, and Yingtan-Xiamen Railway. New types of channel steel and I-beams from this factory can also be found in locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing plants or shipyards in Shanghai, Dalian, Wuhan, Qiqihar, and Harbin, as well as at the First Automobile Works, tractor factories, Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, Baotou Steel, and the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site. If these rolled steel rails and materials were concentrated, they could be used to build six factories each producing 30,000 tractors annually, or to lay one and a half railways stretching from Manzhouli in the northernmost part of the country, through Beijing, to Guangzhou.

    Factory Director Comrade Li Wen said: When the factory started operations, half of the workers came from the countryside; some veteran workers and new technicians assigned here after graduating from universities and colleges were also unfamiliar with these automated devices. However, in the past thousand days, they have responded to the Party's call to improve technology. From the first day of preparation for production, engineering and technical personnel have actively marched towards science, translating technical regulations, carefully observing the operations of Soviet experts, inviting experts to give lectures, and not letting a single question go unanswered. The technical personnel, workers, and team leaders also put forward the guarantee of "ensuring learning and mastery, and ensuring teaching and mastery." By the time the Soviet experts returned to their country at the end of 1954, nearly five hundred workers in major trades had skillfully mastered the equipment performance and operating procedures. Han Shichang was a new worker when the factory started, but now he can independently operate a heating furnace with new automatic instruments. Sun Lichang, from the finishing section, was a rural youth when he joined the factory, and now he has mastered the latest high-frequency quenching operation. By the end of August this year, due to the increasing proficiency of the workers, labor productivity had increased by 1.8 times compared to the beginning of 1954. In the past thousand days, seventy-three workers in this factory have been promoted to cadres above the level of foreman, and one hundred and fifty-three have been promoted to team leaders.

    The workers have proposed a total of one thousand two hundred and fifty-nine rationalization proposals, of which 40% have been implemented. The repair section created the "joint repair method," which can save 133 hours of repair time throughout the year. The electrical section improved the rolling mill's oscillating table and roller interlocking device, greatly reducing the accidents of steel billets drilling under the oscillating table. In order to produce more steel, the steel billet heating section promoted a labor organization that combines flame wind shovels, which doubled the efficiency of handling steel billets.

    As the workers' technical level gradually improved, the factory's production level also increased year by year. In 1954, it only reached 61% of the designed capacity, but last year it exceeded the designed capacity by 16.6%. This year, the planned output of steel rails and steel materials exceeds the designed capacity by more than 70%.

    In the past thousand days, they have not only been able to roll various new types of heavy rails and steel materials, but have also trained 340 skilled technicians and management cadres for nineteen brother factories. Guo Wude, who was promoted from heating worker's assistant to heating section team leader, is currently training four apprentices for a brother factory. Yang Hua, a twenty-three-year-old female crane operator, was a housewife who had never seen a crane three years ago, but now she is driving a crane with a new apprentice, He Suzhen. Yao Ji, a young electrical equipment assistant engineer who returned from an internship at the Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Works in the Soviet Union three years ago, said: "In order for the motherland to produce more steel and establish more iron and steel joint ventures, we must unreservedly teach everything we know to our new colleagues." This year, the factory plans to train another 586 complete sets of management cadres and workers, from factory directors, section chiefs, dispatchers, to rolling and finishing workers, to support the newly built factories.

    一千零六十多天
    文天申
    鞍钢大型轧钢厂从1953年11月底开始生产中国第一批大型钢材以来，到10月底已经一千零六十多天了。在这段时间里，这个工厂的职工们在苏联专家热忱的指导下，已经掌握了技术上比较复杂的重轨、角钢、槽钢、工字钢以及无缝钢管管坯等四十七种产品的生产。在兰新铁路、宝成铁路、集二线、黎湛铁路和鹰厦铁路上，都找得到大型轧钢厂轧制的重型钢轨。在上海、大连、武汉、齐齐哈尔、哈尔滨等机车车辆制造厂或造船厂，在第一汽车厂和拖拉机厂、武钢、包钢和武汉长江大桥的工地上，也找得到这个厂的新型槽钢、工字钢。如果把这些轧制的钢轨、钢材集中起来，可以修盖六座年产三万部拖拉机的工厂，或者铺设一条半从祖国最北部的满洲里通过北京到达广州的铁路。
    厂长李文同志说：工厂开工时，有一半工人来自农村；部分老工人和新从大专学校毕业分配到这里的技术员，对这些自动化的设备也是陌生的。可是一千多天来他们响应了党对提高技术的号召，从开工准备生产的第一天起，工程技术人员就积极地向科学进军，翻译技术规程，仔细地观察苏联专家操作，请专家讲课，不让一个不懂的问题放过，技术人员、工人、班组长又提出了“包学包会，包教包会”的保证。到1954年底苏联专家回国为止，已经有近五百多名主要工种的工人熟练地掌握了设备性能和操作规程。韩世昌在开工时是个新工人，现在已经能独立掌握一个有新式自动仪器的加热炉。精整工段的孙礼昌入厂时是个农村青年，现在已能掌握最新式的高周波淬火操作了。到今年8月底，由于工人的技术日益熟练，劳动生产率已比1954年初提高一点八倍。一千多天来，这个厂已有七十三个工人被提升为工长以上的干部，有一百五十三人提升为班组长。
    职工们共提出了一千二百五十九件合理化建议。其中40％已经实现。检修工段创造了“联合检修法”，全年可节省检修时间一百三十三小时。电气工段改进轧钢摆动台和轧辊连锁装置，大大地减少了钢坯钻到摆动台下的事故。为了多出钢材，钢坯加热工段推行火焰风铲配合的劳动组织，提高了处理钢坯效率一倍。
    由于工人的技术水平逐步提高，工厂的生产水平也一年比一年提高。1954年还只达到设计能力的61％，去年就超过设计能力的16.6％，今年钢轨钢材的计划产量超过设计能力70％以上。
    一千多天来，他们不仅能轧出各种新型重轨和钢材，还为十九个兄弟厂培养了三百四十名熟练的技术工人和管理干部。从加热工助手提升为加热工段班长的郭武德，目前正为兄弟厂培养四名徒工。二十三岁的女吊车工杨华，三年前还是一个没有见过吊车的家庭妇女，现在已经带着一个新徒工何素珍在驾驶吊车了。三年前从苏联下塔吉尔钢厂实习归来的青年电气设备助理工程师姚继同志说：“为了让祖国出更多的钢材、建立更多的钢铁联合企业，我们要毫无保留地把自己知道的一切教给我们的新同行”。今年，这个厂又计划培训出五百八十六名从厂长、科长、调度员、到轧钢、精整工的成套管理干部和工人，去支援新建工厂。
