	On the same day, Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Abba Eban, notified the United Nations Secretary-General that Israeli troops equivalent to two brigades had been withdrawn from Egyptian territory back to Israel.

Xinhua News Agency, 25th dispatch from Cairo by TASS: Newspapers reported that British troops surrounded the Arab residential area of Port Said on the 23rd, preventing any new demonstrations against the occupiers and intimidating residents.

	Newspapers reported that despite the suppression and persecution by the British and French command, Egyptian patriots wrote many slogans on the walls of houses expressing hatred for the aggressors and love for their motherland.
