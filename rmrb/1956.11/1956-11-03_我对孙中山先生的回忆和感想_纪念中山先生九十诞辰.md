    My Memories and Thoughts on Mr. Sun Yat-sen
    ——Commemorating the Ninetieth Anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth
    Zhang Nanxian

    I am currently hospitalized due to an eye ailment. Upon receiving the notice from the Preparatory Committee for the "Ninetieth Anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth," I was filled with excitement and felt I had much to say.

    Sixty years ago, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was the fighting banner of the Chinese people's democratic revolution. His ideals and actions educated the young generation of the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China. Even today, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great revolutionary spirit remains an inspiration for patriotic youth.

    First and foremost, what I can never forget is Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong perseverance, his indomitable spirit, and his fervent pursuit of truth in the revolution.

    Taking his pursuit of the democratic revolution and the organization of revolutionary political parties as an example, from the organization of the Revive China Society, the Tongmenghui, the Kuomintang, the Chinese Revolutionary Party, the Chinese Kuomintang, to the reorganization of the Chinese Kuomintang, he repeatedly reorganized them to adapt the revolutionary organization to the trends of the world and meet the needs of the people. For example, after the failure of the campaign against Yuan Shikai, party members at the time "held divergent opinions when discussing future undertakings, some remained silent about the revolution, others anticipated it would take ten years, and there was widespread discouragement, mutual recrimination, and the revolutionary spirit and revolutionary organizations of the past twenty years were almost completely crushed." Under these circumstances, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, undaunted, "advocated rapid progress, constrained predecessors, encouraged successors, and re-launched the Chinese Revolutionary Party," proposing that the method of this party organization "must rectify the source: (1) reject bureaucrats, (2) eliminate pseudo-revolutionary parties," to purify the organization and restore the face of the revolutionary party before the Republic of China. Although the number of people who joined the Chinese Revolutionary Party at this time was small and its influence was not great, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of revolutionary courage was inspiring. Especially with the enthusiastic help of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, who offered him suggestions for building the party and the army, Mr. Sun Yat-sen also summarized his past struggles and openly admitted that "the organization of our party, from the Revolutionary Alliance to the Chinese Kuomintang, from a secret group to an open political party, has undergone twenty years in its history... However, summarizing the achievements of the past ten years and measuring its effectiveness, one must admit to failure." And he bravely declared: "Our party, seeing this, based on its self-awareness and courage, issued a declaration of reorganization to demonstrate its necessity." ("Declaration on the Reorganization of the Chinese Kuomintang"). At that time, the reorganization of the Chinese Kuomintang was a major political event that shook people's hearts. I remember that I was working as a clerk in the General Staff Department in Beijing when I suddenly received a letter from Mr. Li Renzhao, the Director of the Western Guangdong Post-War Relief, saying that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was preparing to reorganize and revitalize the Kuomintang, and the revolutionary situation would definitely be refreshed. Mr. Li wanted me to go to Guangdong. When I arrived in Guangdong, I met many old friends and inquired about the reorganization of the Kuomintang by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and learned that the central content of the reorganization was to establish the three major policies of alliance with Russia, cooperation with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers. I also learned that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's attitude toward the reorganization was extremely firm, and even if they were old comrades, if they opposed the three major policies, Mr. Sun Yat-sen would expel them from the party. Hearing this, I was both surprised and delighted, and I greatly admired Mr. Sun Yat-sen as a person who loved the motherland, recognized the trends of the times, and had great魄力, and at the same time felt confident in the victory of the revolution.

    Now, reviewing Mr. Sun Yat-sen's speeches during that period, we can see how firm and clear his understanding of the three major policies was.

    At the opening of the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, Lenin passed away. Mr. Sun Yat-sen delivered a speech at the congress, saying: "Everyone knows that the Russian revolution came after the Chinese revolution, but its success came before China's. Its miraculous achievements are unprecedented in the history of world revolution... From a revolutionary point of view, (Lenin) is truly a great success in revolution, a saint in revolution, and the best model in revolution." He proposed that the congress should formally vote to send a telegram to express condolences. At the end of the same year, Mr. Sun Yat-sen took a route through Japan to the north, where he gave a lecture in Kobe. He said: "Now there is a new country in Europe. This country... Europeans regard it as a poisonous snake and beast. Not human. Afraid to get close to him. We Asians also have many people who have the same view. Who is this country? It is Russia. Russia is now separating from the white people in Europe. Why is he doing this? It is because he advocates Wangdao, not Baidao. He wants to talk about benevolence, righteousness, and morality, not about utilitarianism and power... Europeans... are afraid that his advocacy will succeed and break their Baidao. Therefore, they do not say that Russia is benevolent and righteous, but falsely accuse him of being a rebel against the world." This was Mr. Sun Yat-sen's speech a few months before his death, showing his sympathy and yearning for the emerging Soviet Union.

    Regarding the advocacy of assisting farmers and workers, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said in the "Declaration of the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang": "Therefore, the national revolution must rely on the participation of farmers and workers throughout the country before it can be decisive. There is no doubt about this... The Kuomintang is now engaged in resisting imperialism and warlords and resisting special classes that are unfavorable to farmers and workers in order to seek the liberation of farmers and workers. In other words, it is fighting for farmers and workers, and it is also farmers and workers fighting for themselves." In August of the same year, Mr. Sun Yat-sen again lectured at the Peasant Movement Training Institute on "The Tiller Should Have His Land," pointing out that "farmers are the largest majority of our Chinese people. If farmers do not participate in the revolution, then our revolution has no foundation. The Kuomintang's reorganization this time is to include the peasant movement, which is to use the peasants as a foundation... Now, the results of the farmers' labor can only be divided into 40% for the farmers themselves, and 60% for the landlords. The taxes collected by the government are all paid by the farmers, not by the landlords. This situation is very unfair. We didn't have time before to discover this unfairness and promote it. This promotion is the first time... After the farmers are all united, our revolution can be successful."

    In terms of alliance with the Communist Party, after the reorganization of the Chinese Kuomintang in 1924, Mr. Sun Yat-sen assigned Communist Party comrades to various positions in the party, government, and military to be responsible for political work, and for a time a scene of renewal was presented. This is something everyone is very clear about, so I won't say much more.

    Because Mr. Sun Yat-sen re-explained the true meaning of the Three People's Principles and insisted on the implementation of the three major policies, he transformed the stagnant Kuomintang into a vibrant mass party of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and bourgeoisie. As a result, all levels of society in southern China were mobilized, and in every sector, a vigorous and magnificent atmosphere emerged. Although I was over fifty years old at the time, inspired by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit, I also boosted my spirits and followed behind the comrades, working very hard.

    Unfortunately, Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away in Beijing the second year after reorganizing the Chinese Kuomintang. At this time, the comprador forces and feudal forces buried within the Kuomintang began to stir restlessly, seizing military and political power in the name of supporting the new Three People's Principles and the three major policies during the Northern Expedition. Once the Northern Expedition made victorious progress, they seized the fruits of the revolution and turned around to massacre Communists and workers and peasants. From then on, the reactionaries of the Chinese Kuomintang abandoned the true Three People's Principles based on the three major policies.

    I once had the fantasy that if Mr. Sun Yat-sen had lived for another ten or twenty years, and the revolutionary united front continued to develop, and the revolutionary forces of workers and peasants rose more smoothly, then the relationship between domestic class forces would have become more and more favorable to the New Democratic Revolution. Even if domestic and foreign reactionary forces wanted to rise up in resistance, they would have to be more cautious and more difficult. In this way, the New Democratic Revolution could have been completed more smoothly and earlier. Here, I saw the great role played by outstanding leaders who adapted to social development at important historical junctures, and I cherished Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great spirit of pursuing truth in hard struggle throughout his life. I felt that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's early death made me miss him very much when I commemorated his ninetieth birthday today.

    Secondly, I have another thought. Mr. Sun Yat-sen fought for the democratic revolution throughout his life, and it was not until his later years, when he accepted the help of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, that his revolutionary cause achieved rapid development. And Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong ideal—the New Three People's Principles—and his dying wish—peaceful struggle to save China—were only fully realized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a great pioneer of the democratic revolution in history, but a truly thorough democratic revolution can only be carried out to the end by the proletariat. This made me truly realize the invincible power of Marxism-Leninism. Before liberation, I did not have a clear understanding of the Chinese Communist Party, and I did not understand Marxism-Leninism. Since the split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in 1927, I could not see where China's way out was. After the September 18th Incident, I felt even worse and was worried that China would suffer the tragic fate of national subjugation. Historical facts taught me that the Communist Party reiterated the proposal for a national united front during the Anti-Japanese War and once again took the initiative to cooperate with the Kuomintang to supervise each other and jointly resist Japan, which finally brought China back to life. It was only that some people in the Kuomintang once again repaid kindness with enmity and launched a civil war. History is ruthless. Those who violate social development and the people's wishes will only embark on the road to self-destruction.

    In the past few years, the country has achieved a unified situation that has never been seen in history, and China has leaped from an extremely poor and backward country to become a world power. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people's democratic united front is constantly being consolidated and developed, and even Kuomintang members like me, who are old and incompetent, have received the party's education and been given the highest political rights. Even Mr. Sun Yat-sen, this outstanding pioneer of the democratic revolution, has received a correct and glorious historical evaluation under the party's leadership and from the scientific Marxist perspective, and has received unprecedentedly grand commendation and commemoration from the Chinese people. As one of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's old believers, I cannot restrain my joy and happiness today.

    Finally, I have another thought. While we are solemnly commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen throughout the country, the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan Province are also preparing to commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday. I hope that they will learn from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's patriotic spirit of pursuing truth throughout his life, especially understanding Mr. Sun Yat-sen's dying instruction that "Our party's future revolution will not be successful without learning from Russia," and realize the current domestic and international situation and the Chinese Communist Party's policy of a patriotic and democratic united front, bravely admit their mistakes in front of the people of the country, and return with joy. Only in this way is it the only best action and expression to commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday.

    我对孙中山先生的回忆和感想
    ——纪念中山先生九十诞辰
    张难先
    我因患目疾，现正住在医院。在医院里接到“孙中山先生诞辰九十周年”纪念筹备委员会的通知，满怀兴奋，感到有许多话想说。
    六十年前，中山先生是中国人民民主革命的战斗旗帜，他的理想和行动，教育了清末民初的年青一代。直到如今中山先生伟大的革命精神，仍然是爱国青年的鼓舞力量。
    首先，令我最难忘记的是中山先生一生坚韧不拔、勇往直前的、热烈追求真理的革命精神。
    就以中山先生进行民主革命，组织革命政党的事来说，从组织兴中会、同盟会、国民党、中华革命党、中国国民党、一直到改组中国国民党，他就曾为了使革命组织适应世界潮流，合乎人群需要，迭次在进行改组。例如讨袁失败以后，当时的党人“谈及将来事业，意见纷岐，或缄口不谈革命，或期革命以十年，种种灰心，互相诟谇，二十年来之革命精神与革命团体，几于一蹶不振。”在这种情况下，中山先生不屈不挠，“主张急进，约束前人，激励后进，重新发起中华革命党，”提出这次组党的办法“务在正本清源：（一）屏斥官僚，（二）淘汰伪革命党，”以纯洁组织重新恢复民国以前革命党的面貌。虽然这时参加中华革命党的人数不多，影响不大。中山先生的勇往无前的革命精神是令人感奋的。特别是在苏联和中国共产党热情地帮助中山先生，对他提出建党建军的建议，中山先生也总结了自己过去的斗争经验，公开承认了“吾党组织。自革命同盟会以至中国国民党。由秘密的团体而为公开的政党。其历史上之经过。垂二十年。……然综十数年已往之成绩。而计效程功。不得不自认为失败。”并勇敢地宣称：“吾党有见于此。本其自知之明。自决之勇。发为改组之宣言。以示其必要。”（中国国民党改组宣言）在当时，中国国民党的改组，是震动人心的政治大事，记得那时，我正在北京参谋部当个录事，突接广东西江善后督办李任潮先生来信，说中山先生正在预备改组、刷新国民党，革命局面定将一新，李先生要我到广东去，我到了广东，会见好多老友，探问中山先生改组国民党的情形，才知道改组的中心内容是确定联俄联共扶助农工的三大政策，并且知道中山先生对于改组的态度是异常坚决的，尽管是老同志，如果反对三大政策，中山先生就要开除他的党籍。我听了这些，真是又惊又喜，十分佩服中山先生是热爱祖国，认清时代潮流，有极大魄力的人，同时感到对革命有了胜利的信心。
    现在重温那一个时期中山先生的言论，就可以看出他对于三大政策的认识是多么坚定，多么明确。
    在中国国民党第一次全国代表大会开会时，列宁逝世了，中山先生就在大会上发表演说，说：“大家都知道俄国革命，在中国之后，而成功却在中国之前，其奇功伟绩，真是世界革命史上前所未有。……由革命观点看起来，（列宁）实是一个革命之大成功者，是一个革命中的圣人，是一个革命中最好的模范。”他提出大会应正式表决去一电报，以表哀忱。同年年底，中山先生取道日本北上，在神户讲演，他说：“现在欧洲有一个新国家，这个国家……欧洲人都视他为毒蛇猛兽。不是人类。不敢和他相接近。我们亚洲也有许多人都是这一样的眼光。这个国家是谁呢。就是俄国。俄国现在要和欧洲的白人分家。他为什么要这样做呢。就是因为他主张王道。不主张霸道。他要讲仁义道德。不愿讲功利强权……欧洲人……恐怕他的这种主张成功。打破了他们的霸道。故不说俄国是仁义正道。反诬他是世界的反叛。”这是中山先生在他逝世前几个月的演说，看他对新兴的苏联是何等的同情何等的向往。
    扶助农工的主张，在“中国国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言”中中山先生说道：“故国民革命之运动。必恃全国农夫工人之参加。然后可以决胜。盖无可疑者。………盖国民党现正从事于反抗帝国主义与军阀。反抗不利于农夫工人之特殊阶级。以谋农夫工人之解放。质言之。即为农夫工人而奋斗。亦即农夫工人为自身而奋斗也。”同年8月中山先生又在农民运动讲习所，讲演“耕者要有其田”，指出，“农民是我们中国人民之中的最大多数。如果农民不来参加来革命。就是我们革命没有基础。国民党这次改组。要加入农民运动。就是要用农民来做基础。……现在农民的劳动结果。在农民自己只能分四成。地主得了六成。政府所抽的捐。都是由农民出的。不是由地主出的。像这种情形。是很不公平的。我们从前没有工夫。做发现这种不公平的宣传。这回的宣传是第一次。……农民都联络了之后。我们的革命才可以成功。”
    在联共方面，1924年中国国民党改组以后，中山先生把共产党的同志分派在党政军各个岗位内负责政治工作，一时呈现万象更新的气象，这是大家都很清楚的事，我就不多说了。
    由于中山先生重新解释了三民主义的真义，坚持了三大政策的实现，就把那暮气沉沉的国民党，一变而为生气勃勃的工人、农民、小资产阶级、资产阶级的群众性的政党。于是，南中国的各个阶层都发动起来了，无论在那一界，都呈现出如火如荼的磅礴气象，我那时虽说已是五十多岁的人，受到中山先生革命精神的感召，也鼓动精神，随着各同志之后，工作得非常起劲。
    不幸中山先生在改组中国国民党后第二年他就在北京去世，这时埋藏在国民党内的买办势力封建势力就蠢蠢思动，趁北伐进军时期，以拥护新的三民主义和三大政策为名，把军权政权窃夺在手，等到北伐战争胜利开展，就窃夺了革命果实，反手屠杀共产党人和工农群众，从此中国国民党的反动派就把以三大政策为基础的真三民主义抛弃了。
    我曾有过痴想，假如中山先生多活十年二十年，革命统一战线继续发展下去，工农革命力量更顺利地蓬勃上涨，那时国内阶级力量对比的关系，将会愈来愈对新民主主义革命有利，尽管国内外的反动势力要起来反抗，总要有顾忌些，更困难些，这样，新民主主义革命是有可能更为顺利和更早些完成的，这里，我看见了适应社会发展的杰出领袖人物在历史重要关头所起的巨大作用，怀念着中山先生一生在艰苦奋斗中追求真理的伟大精神，感到中山先生的早逝，因而在今天纪念他的九十诞辰时，令我怀恋不已。
    其次，我又有感想。中山先生为民主革命奋斗一生，直到晚年，接受了苏联和中国共产党的帮助，才使革命事业得到突飞猛晋的发展。而中山先生的毕生理想——新三民主义和他临终时的愿望——和平奋斗救中国，也只是在中国共产党的领导下才得到了完全的实现。中山先生在历史上是一位伟大的民主主义革命先行者，但真正彻底的民主革命是确实只有无产阶级才能把它进行到底的。这使我真正体会到了马克思列宁主义的无坚不摧的威力。我在解放前，对中国共产党是认识不清楚的，对马克思列宁主义，是不了解的，自从1927年国共分裂以后，看不见中国的出路在那里，九一八事变以后，心情更不好了，曾耽心中国会不会遭到亡国的惨运。历史事实教训了我，共产党在抗日时期重申民族统一战线的主张，再一次主动与国民党合作，监督对方共同抗日，才终于把中国起死回生了。只是国民党的一部分人竟又一次以怨报德，发动内战，历史是无情的，违背社会发展人民愿望的，结果只是走上自取灭亡的路。
    几年以来，国家得到了历史上从未有过的统一局面，中国已经从一个极端贫困、落后的国家，飞跃成为世界的强国。在中国共产党正确的领导下，人民民主统一战线正在不断巩固与发展，像我这样老耄无能的国民党员，也得到党的教育，并给以最高的政治权利。就是中山先生这位杰出的民主革命的前驱，也是在党的领导下，在科学的马克思主义的观点下，才得到了正确的光荣的历史评价，得到了中国人民空前隆重的表彰和纪念。作为中山先生的旧信徒之一，我在今天是禁不住喜悦欢欣之情的。
    最后，我还有感想。我们在全国范围内隆重的纪念中山先生的时候，台湾省的国民党军政人员目前也是在筹备纪念中山先生诞辰。希望他们学习中山先生一生追求真理的爱国精神，特别体会中山先生晚年“我党今后之革命非以俄为师断无成就”的遗训，大觉大悟，认清当前的国内外形势，认清中国共产党的爱国民主统一战线的政策，勇敢地在全国人民面前承认错误，欣然来归。只有这样，才是纪念中山先生诞辰唯一最好的行动和表现。
