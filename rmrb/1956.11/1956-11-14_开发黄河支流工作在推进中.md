Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 11th: The basic work on developing the Yellow River's tributaries, which is part of the first phase of the Yellow River comprehensive utilization project, is being actively promoted. This basic work is being carried out to reduce the amount of sediment entering the Sanmenxia Reservoir and to solve the problem of flooding in the lower reaches of the Yellow River.

More than 1,800 employees of the Yellow River Survey and Design Institute, from early spring to now, have conducted surveys, measurements, and drilling work on the San Chuan River, Wuding River, Jing River, Nanluo River, Yi River, and Qin River basins, which are tributaries of the Yellow River from Tuoketuo downstream to Mengjin. This work has collected data for the preliminary design of the basin plans or tributary reservoir projects for each tributary. At the same time, another group of employees at the Yellow River Survey and Design Institute, based on the data collected by the survey teams, have been carrying out hydrological and hydraulic calculations, material testing and analysis, topographic mapping, and planning and compilation work. By late October, the basin plan for the San Chuan River in western Shanxi Province had been completed. This is the third Yellow River tributary basin plan completed after the Fen River basin plan and the Yi-Luo River (i.e., the Yi River and its tributary Nanluo River) basin plan. Based on the natural conditions of the San Chuan River basin, the plan determines that water and soil conservation work should be vigorously carried out in this basin, rather than building large reservoirs.

The survey of the Wuding River basin, one of the major tributaries of the Yellow River in northern Shaanxi Province, has been completed. The survey team returned to Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, in mid-October. They surveyed 23,500 square kilometers of loess hilly areas, loess-covered desert areas, and river source areas in the Wuding River basin, and surveyed ten comparative dam sites for reservoirs on the main stream of the Wuding River. They are now actively compiling a summary of the Wuding River basin plan, which is expected to be formally compiled by January next year.

In eastern Gansu Province and central Shaanxi Province, after six months of arduous fieldwork, the survey team has completed a general survey of 47,800 square kilometers of the Jing River basin, and surveyed 70 dam sites for reservoirs on the main stream, tributaries, and branch ditches. After returning to Zhengzhou City in batches in late October, they are now preparing for the Jing River basin plan.

The survey team, which is collecting design data for the Yi River and Nanluo River reservoir projects, is currently actively conducting drilling work in Guxian and other places on the Yi River and Nanluo River.

In order to completely eliminate the threat of floods to the dikes and dams in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, Qin River reservoirs must also be built while constructing the Yellow River Sanmenxia Reservoir and the Yi River and Nanluo River reservoirs. Originally, when the Qin River basin plan was compiled last year, the reservoir dam site was not well selected due to the complex terrain and geological conditions of the Qin River basin. Therefore, geological surveying and mapping of the Qin River basin has been carried out since September this year. Now, the key geological surveying and mapping work in this basin has ended at the end of October, and the survey team is sorting out the collected data while continuing to conduct geological reconnaissance work in the upper and lower reaches of the Qin River.

### 开发黄河支流工作在推进中

    开发黄河支流工作在推进中
    新华社郑州11日电　黄河综合利用第一期工程中关于开发黄河支流的基本工作，正在积极推进。这一基本工作是为了减少进入三门峡水库的泥沙和解决黄河下游水灾问题而进行的。
    黄河勘测设计院的一千八百多名职工，从今年初春到现在，已经对黄河托克托以下到孟津间的支流三川河、无定河、泾河、南洛河、伊河、沁河流域进行了查勘、测量、钻探等工作，为各个支流流域规划或支流水库工程的初步设计搜集了资料。同时，黄河勘测设计院的另一批职工又根据勘测队搜集来的资料，进行了水文、水利计算、材料试验分析、地形清绘、规划编制等工作。到10月下旬，山西省西部三川河的流域规划已经编制完毕。这是继汾河流域规划和伊洛河（即伊河及其支流南洛河）流域规划以后完成的第三个黄河支流流域规划。根据三川河流域的自然条件，规划中确定将在这个流域内大力地开展水土保持工作，而不建筑大型水库。
    陕西省北部黄河大支流之一的无定河流域，已经查勘完毕。查勘队10月中旬已经返回河南省郑州市。他们在无定河流域查勘了两万三千五百平方公里的黄土丘陵区、黄土盖沙漠区和河源区，在无定河干流勘测了十个水库比较坝址。现在，他们正在积极编制无定河流域规划概要，预计到明年1月可以把正式规划编制出来。
    在甘肃省东部和陕西省中部，查勘队经过六个月的野外艰苦工作，已经对泾河流域四万七千八百平方公里面积做了普查，勘测了干流、支流、支沟水库坝址七十处。他们在10月下旬分批回到郑州市以后，又在着手做泾河流域规划的准备工作。
    为伊河和南洛河水库工程搜集设计资料的勘测队，目前正在伊河、南洛河故县等处积极进行钻探工作。
    为了彻底解除洪水对黄河下游堤坝的威胁，在兴建黄河三门峡水库和伊河、南洛河水库的同时，还要兴建沁河水库。原来在去年编制沁河流域规划时，因沁河流域的地形和地质情况复杂而没有选好水库坝址。因此，从今年9月起又进行了沁河流域的地质测绘工作。现在，这个流域的重点地质测绘工作已经在10月底结束，勘测队正在一面整理搜集到的资料，一面继续在沁河的上游和下游，进行地质普查工作。
