Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd. New York dispatch: The press officer of the Egyptian delegation to the United Nations, A.M. el-Hassani, issued a statement on November 1st at the UN headquarters, saying: "Britain and France have in fact declared war on Egypt in a cowardly and despicable manner together with Israel. French and British bombers are fighting alongside Israeli forces in the Sinai Desert. Israeli airfields are now being used as bases for the French and British air forces."

    Hassani refuted the pretext used by Britain and France for invading the Suez Canal Zone. He said: "When the representatives of Britain and France spoke at the United Nations, they said that they were intervening with military forces to ensure the safety of navigation in the Suez Canal. This utter fabrication has been exposed before world opinion. British warships and aircraft sank an Egyptian destroyer in the canal, thereby blocking the canal. After this, would anyone with logic believe this?"

    Hassani also exposed the atrocities of the British and French air forces in indiscriminate bombing of Egypt, and debunked the lie that the British and French air forces only bombed military targets. He pointed out that "the number of civilians killed and injured by air raids is increasing every hour," and that "Heliopolis Hospital, an Islamic mosque, the Egyptian Military Academy, and innocent civilians have become the targets of the criminal British and French bombing."

    He called on world opinion to stop the aggression crimes of Britain and France.

    埃及驻联合国代表团宣布
    英法已同以色列一起向埃宣战
    新华社2日讯　纽约消息：埃及驻联合国代表团新闻发布人阿·穆·哈萨尼11月1日在联合国总部发表声明说：“英国和法国事实上已经用一种怯懦和可耻的方法和以色列一起向埃及宣战。法国和英国的轰炸机正在和以色列的部队一道在西奈沙漠作战。现在已经把以色列的机场作为法国和英国空军的基地。”
    哈萨尼驳斥了英法两国进兵苏伊士运河区的借口。他说：“英国和法国的代表在联合国发言的时候说，他们是为了确保苏伊士运河的航行安全才以军事部队进行干涉的。这种彻头彻尾的捏造已经在世界舆论面前暴露了。英国的军舰和飞机在运河内击沉了一艘埃及驱逐舰，从而封锁了运河，在这以后，任何懂逻辑的人难道会相信这个吗？”
    哈萨尼还揭露了英法空军在埃及滥炸的暴行，揭露了所谓英法空军只轰炸军事目标的谎言。他指出，“因空袭而死伤的平民每小时都有增加”，“希利奥波利斯医院、一座伊斯兰教寺院、埃及军事学院和无辜的平民都成了罪恶的英法轰炸的目标”。
    他呼吁世界舆论制止英法的侵略罪行。
