Response to Criticism

    The incident of some cadres in Yiyuan County, Shandong Province, beating the family member of a martyr, Zheng Zhimei, which was exposed in the article "Why Beat the Family Member of a Martyr? And Why No Action?" published on page 4 of this newspaper on August 29th, has been dealt with by the Supervisory Committee of the CPC Linyi Prefecture Committee and the Supervisory Office of the Linyi Administrative Office.

    The former District Head, Zhang Chengyin (currently the Director of the County Cooperative), developed from severe bureaucratism, one-sidedly listening to slander from bad elements, to violating laws and regulations; the current District Head, Zhang Zhaolun, severely violated laws and regulations; the Village Head, Du Chunjie, harbored personal grudges because Zheng Zhimei exposed his mistakes and retaliated out of spite. Therefore, they were all given the punishment of removal from their posts both inside and outside the Party.

    The Township Head, Du Bentai, although seriously violated laws and regulations, was influenced by the district cadres, and after education, made a better self-criticism, and was given a warning within the Party.

    In addition, the County Head, Dong Qinxiang, the former Deputy Procurator-General of the Yiyuan County People's Procuratorate, Li Xiujiang, as well as the Yiyuan County People's Court, and the CPC Yiyuan County Committee, made bureaucratic mistakes in handling this incident, and have been ordered to conduct profound self-criticisms.

    Zheng Zhimei suffered illness and caused difficulties in family life due to being hit and persecuted, and the County People's Committee is responsible for providing treatment and resolving her living difficulties.

    吊打烈属郑志美事件已作处理
    8月29日本报四版刊登的“为什么吊打烈属？又为什么不处理？”一文所揭发的山东沂源县的一些干部吊打烈属郑志美事件，已经中共临沂地方监察委员会和临沂专署监察处作了处理。
    前任区长张承印（现任县社主任），从严重官僚主义偏听偏信坏分子一面之词，发展到违法乱纪；现任区长张照伦，严重违法乱纪；村主任杜春杰因郑志美揭发他的错误而存有私人成见，挟嫌报复，因而都给予党内外撤职处分。
    乡长杜本太虽系严重违法乱纪，但系受区干部的影响，经教育后检讨较好，给予党内警告处分。
    另外，县长董钦祥、前沂源县人民检察院副检察长李秀江，以及沂源县人民法院、中共沂源县委，在处理此一事件中存在着官僚主义的错误，已责成他们作深刻检讨。
    郑志美因受打击迫害致疾并造成家庭生活困难，县人民委员会负责给予治疗和解决其生活困难。
