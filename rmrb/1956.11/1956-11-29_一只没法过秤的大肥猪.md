A big fat pig weighing seven or eight hundred jin raised by Zhang Peisheng, a member of the Lihe Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, has aroused the interest of many farmers. One day, people came to see the fat pig being weighed. Weighing this big pig was even more troublesome than Cao Cao using boats to weigh elephants. One scale couldn't handle it, so two scales were used, with a thick wooden board on top. The person operating the scale was sweating profusely, and in the end, they still couldn't get an accurate number. Now, its weight is estimated based on the experience of seasoned farmers. Recently, Zhang Peisheng used a tailor's tape measure to measure its body length and height. It is said that the big pig is more than eight chi long from head to tail, two chi seven cun tall, and one chi two cun wide at the buttocks. Its back is like a long, small tabletop. A pig weighing seventy jin looks like a newborn piglet next to it.

Before the land reform, Zhang Peisheng, in his own words, was a poor peasant who couldn't even afford to keep a dog. Due to lack of food and clothing, he and his wife both had to work as laborers. After the land reform, Zhang Peisheng, like all the poor peasants, was allocated land, a house, and livestock sheds. Zhang Peisheng is an honest farmer who wanted to raise pigs but didn't have the capital. After joining the cooperative, his income increased compared to the past. Apart from food and clothing, he had a little surplus and started raising pigs. The cooperative supported its members in raising pigs, lending them capital for pig raising, allocating feed fields, and the cooperative's animal husbandry technicians also gave the members' pigs vaccinations. With the support of the cooperative, Zhang Peisheng bought a pig weighing more than thirty jin, and with careful care, it gained about one jin of meat per day. This pig has been raised for nearly two years and has never been sick. Zhang Peisheng often says: This pig is my "bank," and my savings are all in it. Now, he can not only afford to raise a pig weighing several hundred jin, but he also has meat pigs, sows, and thirteen piglets in the pen. It can be said that he is raising a whole group of pigs. His home no longer looks like a place where even a dog couldn't be kept. Now, his family has pigs and sheep in the pen, rice and clothing in the house, new bright glass windows have been installed in the rooms, and the children are neatly dressed for school. This year, the couple worked more than two hundred labor days, and with a distribution of one yuan and eight jiao per labor day, his family will earn more than one hundred yuan more than last year in the elementary cooperative.

People who visit Zhang Peisheng's home all praise Zhang Peisheng's pig-raising skills. (Xinhua News Agency)

    一只没法过秤的大肥猪
    江苏省无锡县蠡涸乡农业生产合作社社员张培生养的一只七、八百斤重的大肥猪引起许多农民的兴趣。有一天，人们都来看肥猪过秤。这只大猪过秤，简直比曹操用船秤大象还费事，一个磅秤打不住，用了两个磅秤，上面还搭一块厚木板，把司秤的人忙得一头大汗，最后还没有秤出一个准确的数字。现在算它的重量都是根据有经验农民估计的。最近张培生用量衣服的皮尺量过它的体长和身高。据说那只大猪连头带尾已长达八市尺余，身高二尺七寸，臀部有一尺二寸宽。背部像张长形的小桌面一样。一只七十来斤重的猪和它在一起，相形之下像只初生的乳猪。
    张培生在土地改革以前，用他自己的话说：是个连狗都养不起的贫农。因为缺吃少穿衣食不周，夫妻双双出外帮工。土地改革以后，张培生像所有的贫农一样分到了田、房子还有畜舍。张培生是个老实巴结的庄稼汉，想养猪没有本钱，加入合作社以后，收入比过去增加，除了吃穿还略有剩余，开始喂猪。合作社支持社员养猪，借给养猪本钱，分给饲料田，社里的畜牧兽医技术员还给社员的猪打防疫针。张培生得到合作社的支持，买来一条三十多斤重的猪，又加上细心照料，一天长肉约一斤左右。这只猪养了近两年的时间，从未生过病。张培生常说：这只猪就是我的“银行”，我的存款都在它身上。现在，他不仅养得起一头几百斤的猪，圈里还养了肉猪、母猪和十三头仔猪，可以说得上饲养了一群猪了。他家变得再也不像一头狗也养不起的模样了。现在他家圈里有猪有羊，家里有米有衣，房里新安装了明亮的玻璃窗，孩子们也穿得整整齐齐地上学。今年两口子做了二百多个劳动日，按一个劳动日一元八角分配，他家又要比去年在初级社时多收入一百多元。
    到张培生家参观的人们，都称赞张培生养猪的本领。（新华社）
