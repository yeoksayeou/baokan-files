Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd: According to the Romanian News Agency (Agerpres), Bucharest, November 22nd: Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government Premier János Kádár gave an interview to a Romanian News Agency reporter.

    In answering a question about the current situation in Hungary, Kádár said: By the end of last week, the armed groups within Hungary had been eliminated. Currently, there are some small bands of bandits hiding in the forests. In the provinces, the situation has consolidated relatively quickly, work has resumed, and farmers are diligently carrying out unfinished agricultural tasks. Factories have resumed work, but in some places, work has stopped again in some enterprises because small groups of armed terrorists are threatening workers. The working class has adopted a firmer stance on the issue of resuming work than before. The working class, understanding the weight of its responsibilities, is increasingly unwilling to stand with those who incite people against resuming work and does not allow these elements to participate in meetings. This fact is of great significance. The government has received many requests to quickly reorganize Hungary's forces to maintain public order, as their assistance is sufficient to stop the actions of terrorists who threaten work and public safety. The working class was deeply impressed by the government's decree on the establishment of workers' committees. Workers' committees have full rights regarding factory affairs, establishing local wage systems, and allocating a certain percentage of the factory's income to workers. Kádár said that we are facing the enormous tasks of healing the serious wounds caused by the struggle, starting production, and preventing the imminent danger of inflation.

    Kádár then answered the question of what factors allowed the counter-revolutionary forces to run rampant. He said that the counter-revolutionary forces grew primarily due to the weakness of the Imre Nagy government, which did not stand firm in the face of various manifestations of counter-revolution. On the one hand, it was incompetent; on the other hand, it allowed itself to drift with the tide and repeatedly yielded to the increasingly stubborn demands made by right-wing elements to the government. The plan of the counter-revolutionary forces was drafted by Mindszenty, who advocated the abolition of the Nagy government, opposed democratic and socialist achievements, opposed land reform, and opposed the public ownership of the means of production. At the same time, in many cities and villages, arrests and murders of communists and activists continued, and in many places, ordinary workers were arrested and killed, with atrocious acts occurring one after another.

    When asked about the stage of normalization of life in Budapest, Kádár replied: Generally speaking, the food supply situation in Budapest can be considered satisfactory. The long queues in front of food stores have shortened. However, long queues still exist in front of textile stores, hardware stores, and household goods stores, because fear of inflation has triggered a wave of panic buying. While the police are being reorganized, decisive action will be taken against the bandits, many of whom are criminals who escaped from prison. Work has now begun to restore the city's transportation network. The municipal authorities have been considering ways to meet the needs of the people; due to the depletion of coal reserves, it has become necessary to implement certain restrictions on electricity consumption.

    Regarding the attitude of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government towards international relations, Kádár replied: The attitude of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government can be seen from the government declaration of November 4th. We hope to establish friendly relations with all countries, especially socialist countries, on the basis of full respect for our country's independence and sovereignty. The government cherishes and expresses gratitude to all countries, especially socialist countries, for the assistance they have given to our people during the difficult days they have experienced.

    卡达尔总理谈匈牙利目前的局势
    国内各武装集团已被消灭，还有一些小股匪徒躲在森林里
    政府面临医治创伤、开始生产和防止通货膨胀的巨大任务
    新华社23日讯　据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特22日讯：匈牙利工农革命政府总理卡达尔向罗马尼亚通讯社记者发表了谈话。
    卡达尔在回答关于匈牙利目前局势的问题的时候说：到上周末为止，匈牙利境内各武装集团已经被消灭。目前还有一些小股匪徒躲藏在森林里。在省里，局势已有较迅速的巩固，工作也恢复了，农民们也正在勤劳地进行着未完成的农业工作。各工厂已经复工，但是在若干地方，由于有小股的武装恐怖集团在威胁工人，所以在若干企业里，工作又停顿了。工人阶级对于复工问题采取了比以往坚定的立场。工人阶级由于理解到自己责任重大，所以越来越不愿意同鼓动人们反对复工的分子站在一起，并且不让这些分子参加会议。这一事实是有重要意义的。政府接到了好些请求，要求迅速改组匈牙利的部队以维持公共秩序，因为在他们的协助下足以制止那些威胁到工作和公共安全的恐怖分子的行动。工人阶级对于政府就组织工人委员会问题而颁布的法令，获得了深刻的印象。工人委员会对于有关工厂的事务，建立当地工资制度和从各工厂的收入中分配一定的比例给工人等问题，享有充分的权利。卡达尔说，我们正面临着医治斗争所造成的严重创伤、开始生产和防止有到来的危险的通货膨胀的巨大任务。
    卡达尔接着回答了关于是什么因素使得反革命势力得以猖獗的问题。他说，反革命势力之所以增长，首先是由于伊姆雷·纳吉政府的软弱，这个政府在反革命的各种表现面前没有站稳立场。一方面，它是无能的，另一方面，它让自己随波逐流，并且一再对右翼分子向政府提出的越来越顽强的要求让步。反革命势力的计划是明曾蒂拟订的，明曾蒂主张废除纳吉政府，反对民主和社会主义成就，反对土地改革，并且反对生产资料的公有制。与此同时，在许多城市和乡村，当时仍然在继续逮捕和杀害共产党人和活动分子，在许多地方，逮捕和杀害普通工人，残暴的兽行层出不穷。
    谈到布达佩斯生活正常化所处的阶段的问题时，卡达尔回答说：一般地说，布达佩斯的粮食供应情况可以认为是令人满意的。在粮食店门口排的长蛇阵已经变短了。但是在纺织品商店门口，铁器和家庭用品商店门口，仍然排着长蛇阵，因为害怕通货膨胀的情绪引起了一股抢购的浪潮。在警察整编的同时，将开始对盗匪采取决定性的行动，在这帮人中，许多是从监狱逃出的罪犯。现在已经开始恢复这个城市的交通网的工作。市政当局一直在考虑要满足人民的需要；由于存煤已经用光，所以不得不对电流的消耗实行某种限制。
    关于匈牙利工农革命政府对国际关系所抱的态度的问题，卡达尔回答说：工农革命政府的态度可以从11月4日的政府宣言中看出来。我们希望在充分尊重我国独立和主权的基础上同一切国家、首先是同社会主义国家建立友好关系。政府珍视并且表示感谢各国，特别是社会主义国家在我国人民所经历过的艰难日子里给予我国人民的援助。
