Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th: Purchasing personnel from the Shanghai Jewelry and Jade Company recently acquired six rough diamonds in the Lijiachuang District of Tancheng County, Shandong Province.

　　These diamonds were found by local farmers in mountain沟小溪s and streams. According to the purchasing personnel, there is a diamond mine there. Local farmers told them that every year during the rainy season from April to June, after a heavy wind and rain, these diamonds often appear in the gravel.

　　Most of the rough diamonds purchased are of clean color. The largest weighs four carats and eighty-five points (equivalent to three fen one li and four si in the Chinese market system). One of them is transparent and crystalline, with a faint blue luster, and beautiful natural edges can be seen through a magnifying glass. According to experienced personnel in the Shanghai jewelry industry, this diamond can be called a "fire oil diamond," which is the most valuable type of diamond, even better in quality than ordinary imported diamonds. This batch of diamonds can be used to set jewelry, as well as in industrial technologies such as metal processing, grinding hard materials, manufacturing precision instruments, and cutting glass.

　　Diamonds are a rare mineral, and the places with the largest production have always been tropical Africa, Brazil, Australia, India, and other places.

    山东发现金钢钻石
    新华社上海10日电　上海市珠宝玉器公司的采购人员，最近在山东省郯城县李家庄区买到了六颗毛坯金刚钻石。
    这些金刚钻石是当地农民在山沟小溪中拾到的。据采购人员说，那里有一个金刚石矿。当地农民曾告诉他们，每年4月到6月的雨季中，一场大风大雨过后，往往会在砂砾中出现这种金刚石。
    买回来的这批毛坯钻石，大多数成色洁净，最大的一颗重四克拉八十五分（合中国市制三分一厘零四丝）。其中有一颗透明晶莹，微带淡蓝色的光泽，从放大镜里可以看到美丽的天然菱角。据上海珠宝业中有经验的人员谈，这颗钻可称火油钻，是钻石中价值最高的一种，比一般进口钻的质量还好。这批金刚钻石，可用以镶制首饰，也可以用在金属加工、研磨坚硬材料、制造精密仪器和切划玻璃等工业技术上。
    金刚石是一种稀有的矿物，产量最多的地方一向是热带的非洲、巴西、澳大利亚、印度等地。
