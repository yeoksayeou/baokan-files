　　Since last winter, an unprecedented mass literacy campaign has taken shape on a broad scale. Over 70 million farmers, workers, and citizens across the country have participated in literacy learning, with farmers accounting for about 62 million. The number of participants in literacy learning is nearly one-third of the total number of illiterate young and middle-aged people in our country. According to preliminary statistics from sixteen provinces and cities including Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Beijing, 4.1 million people had already shed their illiterate status by the time of this year's wheat harvest. It is estimated that more people across the country will shake off illiteracy this year.
　　This year's literacy campaign is being carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner under relatively sound organizational leadership. The development of this work is basically healthy. Various localities have generally formulated literacy plans and strengthened leadership over literacy work. Learning organizations, learning systems, and teaching materials for literacy have been improved in various localities based on past work experience and current new situations, and more attention has been paid to the regular learning of farmers, which has improved the efficiency of literacy work to varying degrees. This is the basic characteristic of this year's literacy campaign. However, in the process of carrying out this work, there have also been instances of impatience and rashness. Some areas, without proceeding from the actual situation and without considering subjective and objective conditions, set their literacy plans too high and too urgently, and there were once instances of coercion and commandism. After this phenomenon was corrected, the lower-level literacy leadership departments in some areas became somewhat passive and conservative, and spontaneous phenomena occurred. Some places even inappropriately contracted or even stopped literacy work. These left-right swings have hindered the development of literacy work.
　　Eliminating illiteracy is an important step in realizing our country's cultural revolution. Carrying out socialist construction requires the broad masses of the people to have a certain level of culture and scientific and technological knowledge. There are a large number of illiterate people among our working people, which forms a sharp contradiction with the requirements of production and construction. Therefore, it is necessary to actively and on a large scale carry out literacy work. However, our country has a vast territory, and the economic and cultural development in various regions is uneven, and the development of work is also uneven. Eliminating a large number of illiterate people within the expected time limit is a complex and arduous task. We must have a full estimate and understanding of this situation. All localities must make great efforts to eliminate illiteracy in a planned and gradual manner. On this issue, impatience or conservatism are both wrong.
　　In order to actively and steadily carry out literacy work, all localities should revise existing plans or formulate new plans in a realistic manner, and eliminate illiteracy in batches and phases. The so-called being realistic, phased, and batched means proceeding from the actual situation of the locality, and proceeding according to the characteristics of the locality and the subjective and objective forces, in different orders of priority, urgency, and slowness. The literacy plan is the program of action and should strive to make it in line with reality. If the original plan is too high and cannot be completed, it can be appropriately lowered; where literacy work has not been actively carried out, efforts should be made to carry it out; those who have not formulated a plan should quickly formulate one; if the plan is formulated correctly, then forces should be organized and concrete measures should be taken to strive to complete it. At present, some places, after investigation and research, have divided into several different types based on the organization and production management of agricultural production cooperatives, the number of illiterate people, and the strength of teachers, and have determined different steps to make the plan in line with objective reality and feasible. This is very good and is the best way to overcome impatience and conservatism.
　　Eliminating illiteracy is a mass cultural learning movement. When mobilizing and organizing the masses to learn, we must rely on the masses, abide by the principle of voluntariness, and oppose coercion and commandism. In this regard, it is very important to take care of the learning needs of the masses of different genders and ages and give full play to the role of the literacy association. Generally speaking, the masses are willing to learn culture. However, due to differences in gender, age, occupation, and health status, their attitudes and requirements for cultural learning are not completely the same. When organizing the masses to learn, attention should be paid to these characteristics. Those who are willing to learn and have the conditions to learn should be organized to learn as soon as possible and helped to persevere in their studies; those who have difficulty in learning can be appropriately delayed; those who are temporarily unwilling to learn should be patiently waited for, and should never be forced. In a word, different requirements should be put forward according to different objects. The literacy association is a mass organization, and it plays a major role in mobilizing and organizing social forces and the masses to learn. Although literacy associations have now been generally established in various localities, various localities have not made good use of the power of this organization and given full play to its role, resulting in it being in name only. This should be improved.
　　At present, many places reflect that the phenomenon of relapse into illiteracy among graduates in literacy campaigns is very serious. According to a survey of the three villages of Macun, Xiqu, and Nanguan in Xinjiang County, Shanxi Province, among the 187 people who graduated from 1952 to the present, 56 have become semi-literate. The number of relapsed illiterates accounts for 30% of the number of graduates. In Hongda Agricultural Production Cooperative, Fangshan Township, Heshan County, Liaoning Province, among the 49 people who graduated in 1954, 10 have relapsed into illiteracy. Therefore, while eliminating illiteracy, all localities should take concrete measures to consolidate the achievements of the graduates' learning and further meet their needs for learning cultural and scientific knowledge.
　　Now that we have entered winter, all localities should seize this favorable season for farmers to learn, quickly do a good job in the propaganda and organization work for illiterate people to enroll in school and various material preparations, and on the basis of the original work, further expand the literacy work widely.

### 积极地稳步地扫除文盲

    积极地稳步地扫除文盲
    从去年冬天开始，一个前所未有的群众性的识字运动，在广大范围内形成了。全国农民、职工和市民参加识字学习的有七千万人以上，其中农民占六千二百万左右。参加识字学习的人数将近占我国青壮年文盲总数的三分之一。据河南、湖北、四川和北京等十六个省市的初步统计，今年麦收的时候已经有四百一十万人摆脱文盲状态。估计今年内，全国各地还将有更多的人摆脱文盲状态。
    今年的扫除文盲工作在比较健全的组织领导下，有计划、有步骤地进行。这个工作的发展基本上是健康的。各地普遍制定了扫除文盲规划，加强了对扫除文盲工作的领导。扫除文盲的学习组织、学习制度和教材内容，各地根据历年工作经验和当前新的情况，都作了改进，并且比较注意农民的常年学习，在不同程度上提高了扫除文盲工作的效率。这是今年扫除文盲工作的基本特点。但是，在进行这一工作的过程中，也曾经有过急躁冒进现象。有些地区不从实际情况出发，不根据主观和客观条件，将扫除文盲规划订得偏高偏急，并且一度发生过强迫命令现象。当这种现象被纠正以后，某些地区的县以下的扫除文盲领导部门消极保守思想又有些抬头，发生自流现象，有的地方还不适当地收缩甚至停止了扫除文盲工作。这种左右摇摆的现象，都使扫除文盲工作的开展受到了妨碍。
    扫除文盲是实现我国文化革命的重要步骤。进行社会主义建设事业，需要广大人民具有一定的文化水平和科学技术知识。我国劳动人民当中有大量的文盲，这同生产建设的要求形成了尖锐的矛盾。因此，积极地大规模地开展扫除文盲工作是必需的。但是，我国地区辽阔，各地经济文化发展不平衡，工作发展也不平衡，要在预期的年限内扫除数量众多的文盲，是一个复杂艰巨的任务。我们对于这种情况，必须有充分的估计和认识。各地必须用极大的努力有计划地、逐步地扫除文盲。在这个问题上，急躁冒进或者消极保守都是错误的。
    为了积极地稳步地开展扫除文盲工作，各地应当实事求是地修订已有的计划或者制定新的计划，分期分批地扫除文盲。所谓实事求是、分期分批，就是从本地实际情况出发，根据本地的特点和主客观的力量，分别先后缓急去进行。扫除文盲的计划是行动的纲领，应当力求使它符合实际。原来计划偏高而不能完成的，可以适当降低；扫除文盲工作还没有积极进行的地方，应当努力进行；没有制定计划的应当迅速制定出来；计划制定得正确的，就应当组织力量，采取具体措施，努力完成。目前有些地方经过调查研究，根据农业生产合作社组织和生产管理的好坏，文盲的多少，师资力量强弱等条件，分为几个不同的类型，确定了不同的步骤，使计划符合于客观实际，切实可行。这是很好的，是克服急躁冒进和消极保守的最好的办法。
    扫除文盲是一个群众性的文化学习运动。在动员组织群众学习的时候，必须依靠群众，遵守自愿原则，反对强迫命令。在这方面，照顾不同性别和不同年龄的群众的学习要求，充分发挥扫除文盲协会的作用是很重要的。一般地说，群众是愿意学习文化的。但是由于性别、年龄、职业和身体健康状况等方面的差异，他们对于文化学习的态度和要求不完全一样。在组织群众学习的时候，应注意这些特点。愿意学习而且有条件学习的，应尽先组织他们学习，并且帮助他们很好地坚持学习下去；学习有困难的可以适当延缓；暂时不愿学习的应当耐心等待，绝不能强迫。一句话，应该根据不同的对象，提出不同的要求。扫除文盲协会是群众性的组织，它在动员和组织社会力量以及群众学习方面起着重大的作用。现在各地虽然已经普遍建立了扫除文盲协会，但是，各地却没很好运用这个组织的力量，充分发挥它的作用，结果形同虚设。这是应当改进的。
    目前，许多地方反映，在扫除文盲中已经毕业的学员回生复盲现象很严重。据山西新绛县马村、西曲、南关三个村的调查，自1952年到现在毕业的一百八十七个人当中，已有五十六人变成了半文盲。复盲人数占毕业人数的30％。辽宁省黑山县芳山镇乡宏大农业生产合作社，1954年毕业的四十九人中，有十人已经复盲。因此，在扫除文盲的同时，各地应当采取具体办法，巩固已经毕业的学员学习所得的成果，并且进一步满足他们学习文化科学知识的要求。
    现在已进入冬季，各地应当抓紧这一有利农民学习的季节，迅速做好文盲入学的宣传组织工作和各种物质准备工作，在原有工作的基础上，把扫除文盲工作进一步广泛地开展起来。
