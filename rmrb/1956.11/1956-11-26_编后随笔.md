　　Post-Editing Notes
　　After Failure

　　The Chahayang Farm has excellent natural conditions for developing a diversified economy; in the past, it also engaged in a wide variety of production undertakings. However, that one time, they failed.

　　After failure, what should be done?

　　One approach is: analyze the situation, learn from the lessons, regroup, and continue to move forward.

　　Another approach is: to be dejected, sigh deeply, cease operations, and announce a retreat.

　　At that time, they followed the latter approach. They retreated to the old path of "going it alone."

　　Taking a new path is always bound to encounter many difficulties.

　　Since the new path is the correct path, a path that is much better than the old path, we should use the revolutionary spirit of struggle to deal with all the difficulties on this advancing path.

　　If the way of walking is wrong, and you bump into a stone by the side of the road, how can you blame the road for being wrong?

　　Failure is not the most terrible thing; retreating after a failure without analyzing the reasons for the failure is the most dangerous thing.

　　Experience comes from practice.

　　The Xinghuo Collective Farm's rice production this year also unfortunately suffered a failure; the vast majority of the rice was greatly reduced due to rice blast disease.

　　According to Xinhua News Agency reporters, the main reason for the reduced production was poor seeds—a batch of mixed rice seeds carrying bacteria were transferred from other places just before sowing; the reason for transferring seeds from other places was that the seeds they had saved themselves had gone bad—they had not been stored properly.

　　The Xinghuo Collective Farm had let seeds go bad in the past; this time the same thing happened again. This is even more painful than the first time it happened. Collective undertakings are large and have many things to manage, and there is a lack of experience, which is a fact. But how does experience increase? Doing one more new thing will add one more experience; doing it right will gain experience, and doing it wrong will also gain experience. If experience is gained from failure, then failure becomes our capital; if we fail once but do not remember any experience, that is a real failure.

　　We must find a way and always pay attention to storing seeds properly! — This piece of experience, the comrades of the Xinghuo Collective Farm and other agricultural cooperatives, should take good note of this time.

    编后随笔
    在失败之后
    查哈阳农场有发展多种经济的极好的自然条件；过去也经营过多种多样的生产事业。可是，那一次，他们失败了。
    失败以后，该怎么办呢？
    一种做法是：分析情况，接受教训，重整旗鼓，继续前进。
    一种做法是：垂头丧气，一声长叹，偃旗息鼓，宣布撤退。
    当时，他们就是照后一种办法做的。他们退回“单打一”的老路上去了。
    走一条新的道路，总是难免碰到许多困难的。
    既然新的道路是正确的道路，是比老路好得多的道路，就该用革命者应有的战斗精神去对待这前进的道路上的一切困难。
    走路的方法不对，碰到路旁的石头上了，怎么能怨这条路不对呢？
    失败并不是最可怕的事；失败之后不分析失败的原因就后退才是最危险的事。
    经一事，长一智
    星火集体农庄今年的水稻生产也不幸遭到了失败，绝大部分水稻都因为发生了稻热病而大大减产了。
    减产的原因，据新华社记者报道，主要是种子不良——在播种前夕才从外地调来了一批混杂的带有病菌的稻种；从外地调种子来的原因是自己留的种子坏了——没有储藏好。
    星火集体农庄过去就把种子放坏过；这一次又发生了同样的事情。这比第一次发生更使人痛心。集体的事业，家大业大，经验少，不好管，这是事实。可是，经验怎样才会多起来呢？多做一件新事，就会多一条经验；做对了会得到经验，做错了也会得到经验。如果从失败中得到了经验，那失败也就成了我们的本钱；如果失败了一次却没有记取什么经验，那才是真正的失败。
    一定要想办法而且经常注意把种子储存好！——这一条经验，星火集体农庄和别的农业社的同志们，这一次该好好记下来了。
