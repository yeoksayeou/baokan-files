Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th – Shenyang has another group of mechanical industrial factories that are busily preparing for reconstruction and expansion. Next year, these factories will begin reconstruction with the help of Soviet experts. Prior to this, five factories reconstructed and expanded with the help of Soviet experts have successively gone into production. After reconstruction and expansion, the technical level of these factories has improved significantly. Among them, the Shenyang Cable Factory's production capacity has increased sixfold compared to before the reconstruction.

While helping Shenyang mechanical factories with reconstruction and expansion, Soviet experts also helped many factories improve their production technology and management level. In the first six months of this year, Soviet experts put forward 920 major suggestions addressing the main problems in the production of various factories. The Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory had once suspended production due to poor product quality. Later, with the help of Soviet experts, it improved technical preparation, process regulations, and product design, enabling the factory to quickly resume production. With the specific help of Soviet experts, the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory changed the production organization of the machine assembly workshop, increasing from two assembly lines to five assembly lines. The output of its main product – large rock drills – in September this year has exceeded the designed production capacity by more than five times.

During the period of helping with construction in Shenyang, Soviet experts also enthusiastically cultivated Chinese workers, engineers, and technicians. This year, nine Soviet experts, including Kulagin, systematically taught production knowledge and management experience to enterprise managers, technicians, and workers at the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory. Mechanical workers in various workshops who were previously unable to adjust complex machine tools are now able to independently adjust machine tools after attending the lectures.

    帮助改建一批机械工业工厂
    据新华社沈阳4日电　沈阳又有一批机械工业工厂正在紧张地进行改建扩建的筹备工作。明年，这些工厂将在苏联专家帮助下动工改建，在此以前，由苏联专家帮助改建、扩建的五个工厂，已经先后投入生产。这些工厂在改建、扩建以后，技术水平都有了显著提高，其中的沈阳电缆厂在改建以后生产能力比改建以前提高了六倍。
    苏联专家在帮助沈阳机械工厂改建、扩建的同时，还帮助很多工厂提高了生产技术水平和管理水平。在今年头六个月里，苏联专家针对各工厂生产上的主要问题，提出了九百二十件重大建议。沈阳第二机床厂曾经因为产品质量低劣而停产，后来在苏联专家的帮助下，改进了技术准备、工艺规程和产品设计等，使这个厂很快恢复了生产。沈阳风动工具厂在苏联专家具体帮助下，改变机装车间的生产组织，由两条流水作业线增加到五条流水作业线，今年9月份主要产品——大型凿岩机的产量，已经超过设计生产能力五倍以上。
    苏联专家在沈阳帮助建设期间，还热情地培养了中国工人、工程技术人员。库拉金等九位苏联专家，今年在沈阳第一机床厂向企业管理人员、技术人员和工人，系统地讲授了生产知识和管理经验。过去对复杂的机床不能调整的各车间机械员，在听课以后，已经能够独立调整机床。
