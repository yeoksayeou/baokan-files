    The Division of Labor Between Preservation and Destruction
    Haimo
    The preservation of antiquities is to prevent destruction.
    In Lijiang, Yunnan, a rare and beautiful place in the world, we were fortunate enough to visit the Grand Treasure Palace, the Glazed Tile Palace, and the Great Tranquility Pavilion, the former palaces of the Mu Heaven Kings in Baisha. These were built by Mu Shengbai, the leader of the Naxi people, during his reign. It should be said that these are the most important existing cultural relics of the Naxi people. Inside these buildings from the Tianqi era of the Ming Dynasty, precious murals are still preserved on the walls. I don't understand mural art, but they seem to be in the same style as the murals of Dunhuang. Although the paintings depict Buddhist affairs, they also reflect the production methods and customs of the time. All the brushstrokes on the paintings are vigorous, and it seems that they were created by famous artists of the time. It is said that an art school sent people to copy them, and the masses also told us how carefully they washed the dust off the walls, lit bright lamps, and spent a long time to complete this arduous task. All this shows that these precious relics have been carefully preserved.
    Even more thankfully, a Baisha Ancient Building Repair Committee was established in the spring of 1955, and the People's Government also allocated more than 1,000 yuan for this work. As a result, the Great Tranquility Pavilion and the Glazed Tile Palace have been renewed. At the same time, a new plaque was added in front of the Great Tranquility Pavilion. The calligraphy on the plaque is also exquisite, and the words "Baisha Ancient Building Repair Committee" are inscribed on the plaque in a grand manner.
    All this is a good thing. It is said that such preservation can prevent destruction. Unfortunately, the people of the repair committee and the people who destroy are divided in their labor. They only need to preserve, spend the money, and they have fulfilled their responsibilities. They do not interfere with or prevent destruction.
    Thus, by June of this year, everything had become unrecognizable. Right under the plaque entitled "Baisha Ancient Building Repair Committee," the rooms and courtyard have become sheds, and the gate is merely fastened with a piece of wire. The murals have been blurred by firewood. The entire Glazed Tile Palace has become the office of the cooperative. The main hall is also full of grain. The Naxi ancient scriptures in the scripture pavilion upstairs have been moved to the corridor and are exposed to wind and rain, and no one cares about the loss. In the empty space under the bed in the pavilion where the scriptures were originally stored, there are one or two pairs of broken shoes instead.
    It is heartbreaking that one of the murals was reportedly peeled off the wall and preserved in the Vajra Temple because the wall was about to collapse. Who knew that this place had also become a repair workshop for the Water Conservancy Committee, and a large pile of heavy wooden wheels had crushed the specially preserved mural into powder. Also, an ancient stone tablet in front of the gate here was pulled down, reportedly to be taken to the mill to be used as a stone step.
    It must be further explained that we went to find He Xiangkun, one of the members of the repair committee here, who is also the principal of the elementary school, and asked him, and he said that he could not manage it because the county cadres were all here. We also went to ask two comrades from the county party committee, and they said, "We are engaged in the cooperative movement!"
    Who should be in charge? Does an ordinary citizen have to sit idly by and watch the destruction of culture?

    保存与破坏的分工
    海默
    对古物的保存是为了防止破坏的。
    在云南丽江，这个世界上稀有的美丽地方，我们曾有幸去白沙参观过当年木天王的宫殿大宝积宫、琉璃殿和大定阁。这些都是纳西族领袖木生白在他的全盛时期所兴建的。应该说这是现有的纳西族最主要的文化遗迹。在这些明朝天启年间的建筑内，墙上还保存着珍贵的壁画，我不懂壁画艺术，但看来和敦煌的壁画同出一种风格。画上虽然表现的是佛家的事，但同时也反映了当时的生产方式和习俗。所有画上的笔法都很劲迈，看来是出自当时名家的手笔。据说有一个美术学校还派人来临摹过，群众还告诉我们那时是多么细心地洗掉墙上的灰尘，点着明灯，花了很长的时日才完成了这件艰苦的工作。这一切都说明对于这些宝贵的遗物是用心保存过的。
    更可感谢的是在1955年春还成立了一个白沙古建筑物修理委员会，人民政府还为这工作拨款一千多元。这样，使得大定阁、琉璃殿都焕然一新了，同时，大定阁前还补上一块新匾，匾上的书法也很精雅，而且堂堂皇皇地在匾上题了白沙古建筑物修理委员会的字样。
    这都是好事。按说这样保存是可以免于破坏了，可惜的是修理委员会的人和破坏的人是分工的，他们只要作到保存，把钱花完，就算尽到职责了，他们并不干涉和防止破坏。
    这样，到了今年6月，一切都面目全非了。就在题为白沙古建筑物修理委员会的匾下，房内和院里已变成了草棚，大门仅仅是用一根铁丝扣上的，壁画已被柴草划得模糊不清了。而琉璃殿整个变成了合作社的办公室，大殿内同样堆满谷物，楼上的藏经阁内的纳西族古文的经书被移到廊下任风雨剥蚀，丢失更无人过问，阁内空空的床下原来藏经的位置，倒是换上了一两双破鞋。
    可痛心的是有一幅壁画据说是为了墙壁要倒坍，才从墙上剥下保存在金刚刹内，谁知这儿也变成了水利委员会的修理工场，一大堆沉重的木轮已将这特意保存的壁画砸成粉碎。还有这儿门前的一块古代的石碑也拉倒了，据说要拿到磨房去当石阶。
    必须再说明一点，我们曾去找过这儿修理委员会的委员之一——小学校长和相坤，问他，他说他不能管，因为县上的干部都在这儿。我们又去问县委的两位同志，他们说：“我们是搞合作运动的！”
    究竟谁应该管呢？就是一个普通公民，难道应该坐观破坏文化而不顾吗？
