Xinhua News Agency, Nicosia, 24th: British Governor Harding announced on the evening of the 22nd an expansion of the scope of the death penalty in order to further suppress the resistance of the Cypriot people. He said that anyone found to be keeping or carrying firearms or explosives would be sentenced to death, and that anyone who "associates" with those possessing weapons would also be sentenced to death. He stipulated that judges responsible for the trial should, in all such cases, pronounce the death penalty without considering the possibility of a reduced sentence.
    Harding's decision to expand the scope of the death penalty was announced as the anti-British movement throughout Cyprus reached its peak. According to the Associated Press, this month, the "Struggle for Cyprus" organization killed fifteen British soldiers in attacks against the British colonial army.

    英殖民者向死神乞灵
    在塞浦路斯扩大死刑范围
    据新华社24日讯　尼科西亚消息：英国总督哈定22日晚间宣布扩大死刑的范围，以便进一步镇压塞浦路斯人民的反抗。他说，任何人如果被发现保存或携带火器或炸药将处以死刑，而凡是同藏有武器者“结交”的人也同样要处以死刑。他规定负责审讯的法官凡遇上述情况一律宣判死刑而不能考虑减刑问题。
    哈定关于扩大死刑范围的决定是正当塞浦路斯各地的反英运动达到高峰的时候宣布的。据美联社消息，在这个月，“为塞浦路斯而斗争”组织在对英国殖民军展开的袭击中杀死了十五个英国兵。
