Xinhua News Agency, November 8th dispatch from New York (TASS): The United Nations General Assembly held an emergency meeting on the morning of November 7 to further discuss the issue of British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt. The representatives of nineteen Asian and African nations submitted a new proposal to the General Assembly.

The proposal states: “The General Assembly,

Reaffirming its resolutions passed by overwhelming majority votes on November 2, 3, and 4, 1956,

Noting in particular that the General Assembly, pursuant to the resolution it adopted on November 4, 1956, established the Command of the United Nations Emergency International Force in order to secure and supervise the cessation of hostilities in accordance with all the terms of the resolution of November 2, 1956.

I. Declares that the United Nations is determined to implement its resolutions and the provisions of the Charter;

II. Reaffirms its demand that Israel immediately withdraw all its troops to behind the armistice lines established by the Armistice Agreement of February 24, 1949;

III. Demands that the United Kingdom and France immediately withdraw all their troops from Egyptian territory;

IV Urges the Secretary-General to communicate this resolution to the parties concerned and requests him to report to the Assembly within twenty-four hours of the adoption of this resolution.”

Egyptian representative Loutfi spoke first at the meeting. He pointed out that although Britain and France were talking about a ceasefire, Egypt was still continuing to suffer aggression. Britain, France, and Israel, in defiance of the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the provisions of the United Nations Charter requiring the peaceful settlement of disputes, were continuing their acts of aggression. After bombing Egyptian cities, British and French forces began on November 5 to attempt to seize Port Said. When they failed, they bombed the city, including residential areas, killing many civilians, including women and children. What is the difference between these aggressors and the Nazi war criminals convicted by the Nuremberg Tribunal? Loutfi refuted the claim that British and French forces had been ordered to cease fire. He said that according to recent reports, fighting was still going on in Port Said.

The Egyptian representative said that the armed forces of Britain, France, and Israel should withdraw from Egypt immediately. The proposal of the Asian and African countries should be accepted by the General Assembly.

The representatives of Denmark, Canada, and Ecuador advocated the adoption of the proposal put forward by Argentina, Burma, Ceylon, Denmark, Ecuador, and Sweden regarding the organization of an “International Emergency Force.” This proposal only "mentions" the United Nations General Assembly resolution of November 2 “regarding the cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of troops, and 'other issues' related to military operations on Egyptian territory." The focus of the proposal is on establishing the "United Nations International Emergency Force Command." The six-nation proposal suggests starting to organize the "International Emergency Force" and establishing an advisory committee composed of representatives from Brazil, Canada, Colombia, India, Iran, Norway, and Pakistan in order to "develop those aspects of the plan regarding the establishment and operation of armed forces that the United Nations General Assembly has not resolved."

Speaking next, Ceylon representative Goonewardene said that the countries invading Egypt should withdraw their troops from Egypt.

U.S. representative Lodge suggested adopting two proposals. He said that the United Nations General Assembly had achieved its first goal—stopping the fighting—and should now turn to the second goal—getting the armed forces of Britain, France, and Israel to withdraw from Egypt. Lodge said the "International Emergency Force" should be deployed to Egypt as soon as possible, and the United States was prepared to help transport these forces.

Jordanian representative Rifai called on the General Assembly to unanimously adopt the proposal of the nineteen Asian and African nations. In mentioning the six-nation proposal and the plan to establish an "International Emergency Force," the Jordanian representative said that Israel must immediately guarantee that its troops will withdraw behind the armistice line before this force enters.

Syrian representative Asha said that the British and French aggressors are talking about a ceasefire, but they are trying to force Egypt to accept their terms for resolving the Suez Canal issue.

The Syrian representative said that if the aggressors are willing to implement the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, they should immediately declare that they will withdraw their troops from Egypt. If this point of withdrawing the invading troops is not clarified, the Syrian delegation cannot support any form of plan.

The last speaker at the morning session was Indonesian representative Sukajao. He said that the measure of a ceasefire alone is not enough. A ceasefire without a troop withdrawal simply means the occupation of Egyptian territory by foreign troops. When he addressed the establishment of an "International Emergency Force," he said that this force should be used to ensure the implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and should in no way hinder the resolution of the Suez Canal issue. It must never be allowed that this force or its activities infringe in any way on the sovereignty or territorial integrity of Egypt. In this spirit, the Indonesian delegation generally supports the six-nation proposal regarding the establishment of an International Emergency Force. However, this proposal should be adopted at the same time as the nineteen-nation Asian-African proposal on the withdrawal of invading troops from Egypt.

### 在联合国大会紧急会议上  埃及代表斥责英法仍未停止侵略

    在联合国大会紧急会议上
    埃及代表斥责英法仍未停止侵略
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会11月7日上午举行紧急会议，进一步讨论英法和以色列侵略埃及的问题。亚非十九国代表团向大会提出一项新的提案。
    这项提案说：“大会，
    重申它在1956年11月2日、3日和4日以绝大多数票通过的决议，
    特别注意到大会根据它在1956年11月4日所通过的决议成立了联合国紧急国际部队司令部，以便根据1956年11月2日的决议的全部条款保证和监督敌对行动的停止。
    一、申明联合国有决心执行它的一些决议和宪章的规定；
    二、再一次要求以色列立即把它的全部军队撤退到1949年2月24日停战协定规定的停战线后面；
    三、要求联合王国和法国立即从埃及领土撤出全部军队；
    四、促请秘书长把这个决议通知有关各方，并且要求他在本决议通过后二十四小时内向大会报告。”
    埃及代表卢特菲在会上首先发言。他指出，英法虽然在谈停火，但是埃及仍旧继续遭受侵略。英、法、以色列三国蔑视联合国大会的决议和联合国宪章要求以和平方法解决分歧的规定，继续侵略行为。英法军队在轰炸埃及城市后从11月5日开始企图侵占塞得港。当他们没有得逞的时候，他们就轰炸这个城市，也轰炸了住宅，杀害了许多市民，其中还有妇女和儿童。这些侵略者和被纽伦堡法庭判罪的纳粹战犯之间有什么区别呢？卢特菲反驳了关于英法军队已经受命停火的说法。他说，根据最近的消息，塞得港的战事仍然在进行中。
    埃及代表说，英、法和以色列的武装部队应当立刻撤出埃及。亚非国家的提案应当被大会接受。
    丹麦、加拿大和厄瓜多尔的代表主张通过阿根廷、缅甸、锡兰、丹麦、厄瓜多尔和瑞典六国提出的关于组织“国际紧急部队”的提案。这个提案只是“提到”联合国大会11月2日“关于停止战火、撤退军队和同在埃及领土上的军事行动有关的“其他问题”的决议。提案的重点放在设立“联合国国际紧急部队司令部”的计划上。六国提案建议着手组织“国际紧急部队”和成立一个由巴西、加拿大、哥伦比亚、印度、伊朗、挪威和巴基斯坦代表组成的咨询委员会，以便“发展联合国大会所没有解决的、关于武装部队的建立和行动的计划的那些方面”。
    随后讲话的锡兰代表古纳瓦地尼说，侵犯埃及的国家应当把军队撤出埃及。
    美国代表洛奇建议通过两个提案。他说，联合国大会已经达到了第一个目的——停止战火，目前应该转到第二个目的——使英、法和以色列的武装部队撤出埃及。洛奇说，“国际紧急部队”应当尽速地开进埃及，美国准备帮助输送这些部队。
    约旦代表里法伊吁请大会一致通过十九个亚非国家的提案。约旦代表在提到六国提案和建立“国际紧急部队”的计划时说，必须立即要求以色列保证：在这支部队开进去以前，它的军队就撤到停战线后面去。
    叙利亚代表亚沙说，英法侵略者正在谈论停火，但是，它们企图强迫埃及接受它们的解决苏伊士问题的条件。
    叙利亚代表说，如果侵略者愿意执行联合国大会的决议，他们应当立即声明，他们将自埃及撤军。如果对撤出侵略军队这一点不加以澄清，叙利亚代表团不能支持任何形式的计划。
    在上午会议上最后发言的是印度尼西亚代表苏加沃。他说，单是停火的措施是不够的。停火而不撤军只是意味着由外国的军队来占领埃及的领土。他在谈到建立“国际紧急部队”的问题的时候说，这支部队应当用来保证联合国大会决议的执行，而绝不应当妨碍苏伊士运河问题的解决。绝不能容许这支部队或者是它们的活动在某种程度上触犯埃及的主权或者是领土的完整。本着这种精神，印度尼西亚代表团总的说来是支持六国提案关于建立国际紧急部队的主张的。但是，这个提案应当同亚非十九国关于自埃及撤退侵略军队的提案同时通过。
