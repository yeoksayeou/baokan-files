    A Voice of Justice at the United Nations General Assembly
    At the recently opened Eleventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Indian representative, both in the General Committee and in the United Nations General Assembly, righteously and sternly put forward proposals requesting the Assembly to discuss the issue of Chinese representation and to restore the legitimate rights that the People's Republic of China should have in the United Nations. These proposals have received support from all socialist countries, many Asian and African countries, Nordic countries, and some other countries in the United Nations. However, the U.S. representative continued to stubbornly maintain an unreasonable attitude, adopting despicable methods that violate the rules of procedure of the United Nations, and rallying a majority vote to reject India's proposal, while once again forcing its unreasonable proposal to avoid discussion of the issue of Chinese representation upon the United Nations. On the 17th, the Indian representative submitted another proposal to the United Nations General Assembly, requesting that the decision adopted by the Assembly on the 16th based on the U.S. proposal not to discuss the issue of Chinese representation at this session be declared invalid, because this decision did not receive the support of a two-thirds majority of member states.
    The positions of India and other countries that support India's proposal are entirely just. They reflect these countries' efforts to safeguard the United Nations Charter and its role, to seek world peace, and to ease international tensions. This is an increasingly strong voice of justice emanating from the United Nations, which has been damaged, insulted, and paralyzed for many years.
    Restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is a matter of course. As representatives of the Soviet Union, India, and many other countries have stated more than once in the United Nations, China is one of the founders of the United Nations and one of the five permanent members of the Security Council; China's population accounts for a quarter of the world's population, and the only one that can represent the 600 million Chinese people is the government of the People's Republic of China. The Chiang Kai-shek clique has long been abandoned by the Chinese people; it can only eke out a meager existence in Taiwan relying on U.S. protection. Anyone with a modicum of sense cannot imagine that it can represent the great China. However, the United States has consistently closed its eyes to reality, stubbornly stuffing the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has been abandoned by the Chinese people, into the United Nations while excluding China's legitimate representatives from the United Nations. This is, in effect, an attempt to force the United Nations, this solemn international organization, to follow the U.S.'s disgraceful policy of aggression: interfering in China's internal affairs, being hostile to the 600 million Chinese people, covering up the U.S.'s forcible occupation of China's territory Taiwan, and undermining normal international relations and maintaining tensions. In the past few years, because the majority of countries in the United Nations have succumbed to the United States, this cannot but morally discredit the United Nations. Therefore, the U.S.'s practice of excluding our country from the United Nations has not and cannot cause any harm to our country, because our country is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong; on the contrary, it has damaged the prestige and role of the United Nations and damaged the lofty goals held by all countries in the world when the United Nations was founded.
    Precisely because of this, more and more people inside and outside the United Nations believe that this absurd situation in the United Nations should end immediately, and the United Nations must immediately restore our country's legitimate status in the United Nations. However, the increasingly isolated U.S. government has become even more unreasonable in its attitude towards the United Nations and other UN member states on this issue. It has taken many measures to threaten other countries to follow it, and has sent Nolan, the chief figure of the so-called "China Lobby," who is extremely hostile to the Chinese people, as its representative to the United Nations General Assembly to put pressure on other countries. Nevertheless, the number of countries voting in favor of India's proposal this year, advocating that the issue of Chinese representation be placed on the agenda, reached twenty-five, more than double the number of countries that took the same stance last year. In terms of population, these twenty-five countries, together with China, account for two-thirds of the world's population. The countries that followed the United States in voting are almost all countries that have military treaties with the United States—mainly the Southeast Asia Treaty, the Baghdad Pact, the Inter-American Treaty, and most of the North Atlantic Treaty countries. Among these countries, there are also many that are dissatisfied with the U.S.'s illegal act of excluding the People's Republic of China, but under U.S. pressure, they have involuntarily implemented policies that violate the wishes of their own people.
    What is intolerable is that the British government, which has long recognized our country, has actually taken the unreasonable stance of following the United States in depriving our country of its legitimate rights in the United Nations year after year for its own ulterior motives. This is a very shameful act, and the people of our country cannot but express great indignation at this. Pakistan has friendly and normal diplomatic relations with our country, and the Pakistani Prime Minister, during his visit to our country, also expressed his willingness to work with our country to make the greatest efforts to safeguard world peace and ease international tensions. However, the Pakistani representative voted against India's reasonable proposal at the United Nations this time, which cannot but be regretted.
    However, the ever-increasing influence of the People's Republic of China in world affairs cannot be stopped by any force. The just voices of India, the Soviet Union, and other countries on the issue of restoring our country's representation will one day break through the dark clouds shrouding the United Nations and bring the United Nations back to the correct path of the United Nations Charter.

### 联合国大会上的正义声音

    联合国大会上的正义声音
    在最近开幕的第十一届联合国大会上，印度代表曾先后在总务委员会和联合国大会上义正词严地提出建议，要求大会讨论中国代表权问题，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国应有的合法权利。这些建议，得到了在联合国的所有社会主义国家、很多亚非国家、北欧国家和其他一些国家的支持。但是，美国代表仍然坚持横蛮无理的态度，采取违背联合国议事规则的卑鄙办法，纠合多数票否决了印度的建议，而把它所提出的回避讨论中国代表权问题的无理提案，又一次强加于联合国。印度代表在17日又向联合国大会提出一个提案，要求宣布大会在16日根据美国提案所通过的这届大会不讨论中国代表权问题的决定为无效，因为这个决定并没有得到三分之二的多数会员国的赞同。
    印度和支持印度建议的各国的主张是完全公正的。它反映了这些国家对于维护联合国的宪章和作用，谋求世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势的努力。这是在多年来被损害、被污辱、被瘫痪了的联合国中所发出来的越来越强有力的正义的声音。
    恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，是天经地义的事。正如苏联、印度和其他许多国家的代表在联合国中不止一次地所阐明的，中国是联合国创始者之一，是安全理事会五个常任理事国之一；中国的人口占世界四分之一，唯一能够代表六亿中国人民的是中华人民共和国政府。蒋介石集团早就被中国人民所唾弃，它只是依靠美国的庇护才能在台湾苟延残喘。任何稍有理智的人，都不可能想像它能代表伟大的中国。可是，美国却一直闭着眼睛不顾现实，硬把为中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团塞在联合国里，而把中国的合法代表排斥在联合国之外。这实际上是企图强迫联合国这个庄严的国际组织追随美国的可耻的侵略政策：干涉中国内政，敌视六亿中国人民，掩护美国强占中国的领土台湾，破坏正常的国际关系和保持紧张局势。过去几年来，由于联合国的多数国家屈从美国，这就不能不使联合国在道义上声名扫地。因此，美国在联合国排斥我国的做法，对我国并没有也不可能造成什么损害，因为我们国家正在日益繁荣和壮大；相反地却损害了联合国的威信和作用，损害了世界各国在创立联合国时所怀抱的崇高目标。
    正是因为这样，联合国内外已有越来越多的人认为联合国的这种荒谬情况应当立刻结束，联合国必须立即恢复我国在联合国中的合法地位。可是处境愈来愈孤立的美国政府，在这个问题上对待联合国和其他联合国会员国的态度却更加蛮不讲理了。它采取了许多措施来威胁别的国家跟着它走，并且派出了以极端敌视中国人民出名的所谓“院外援华集团”的首要分子诺兰为代表，到联合国大会来向别的国家施加压力。尽管如此，今年投票支持印度建议、主张把中国代表权问题列入议程的国家却达到二十五国，比去年采取同样态度的国家增加一倍多。就人口来说，这二十五个国家和中国在一起，已达到全世界的三分之二。追随美国投票的国家，差不多全是同美国订有军事条约的国家——主要是东南亚条约、巴格达条约、泛美条约和大多数北大西洋条约国家。而在这些国家中，也有不少是不满意美国排斥中华人民共和国这种非法行为的，但是它们在美国的压力下，竟然身不由主地执行了违反其本国人民愿望的政策。
    令人不能容忍的是，早就承认了我国的英国政府，竟为了它的不可告人的目的，年复一年地采取追随美国剥夺我国在联合国合法权利的无理态度，这是非常可耻的行为，我国人民对此不能不表示极大的愤慨。巴基斯坦同我国有着友好的正常的外交关系，巴基斯坦总理在访问我国期间，并曾表示愿意和我国一道尽最大的努力来维护世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势，但是巴基斯坦代表这次在联合国对印度的合理建议却投了反对票，这不能不使人感到遗憾。
    但是，中华人民共和国在世界事务中越来越大的影响，是任何力量所无法阻挡的。印度、苏联等国在恢复我国代表权问题上所发出的正义的声音，终有一天要冲破笼罩联合国的阴云，使联合国回到联合国宪章的正确道路上来。
