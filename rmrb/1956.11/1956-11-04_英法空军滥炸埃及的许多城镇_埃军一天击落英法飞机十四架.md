Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Cairo: The Anglo-French Air Force spent the entire day of November 2nd indiscriminately bombing many densely populated towns in Egypt. Egyptian religious temples and peaceful residents became the targets of Anglo-French air strikes.

    The Egyptian military announced in a communiqué on the evening of November 2nd that Anglo-French aircraft directly bombed a temple while bombing the city of Cairo. A total of 104 peaceful residents were killed and more than 40 were injured in various locations that day.

    According to the 13th communiqué issued earlier on November 2nd by the Egyptian Army Headquarters: "In the past 24 hours, Anglo-French bombers have carried out a total of 42 air raids on Egyptian towns. Aircraft have been fiercely attacking densely populated towns. The full extent of the losses is not yet known, but one of the results of an air raid on Suez was that a large fishing boat was hit and sunk by Anglo-French bombs right at the entrance to the canal, thus blocking the entrance."

    Anglo-French aircraft encountered fierce interception from the Egyptian Air Force and anti-aircraft fire. An Associated Press correspondent in Cairo, reporting on an air raid he witnessed, said that as British aircraft screamed over Cairo, "Egyptian anti-aircraft guns spewed out fierce fire, and one aircraft was hit" and crashed outside the city.

    The Egyptian military communiqué stated that a total of fourteen Anglo-French aircraft were shot down that day. According to the Middle East News Agency, nine of these fourteen aircraft were shot down in Cairo. In addition, two were shot down in Alexandria and Port Said respectively, and one was shot down in the Nile Delta.

    英法空军滥炸埃及的许多城镇
    埃军一天击落英法飞机十四架
    据新华社3日讯　开罗消息：英法空军11月2日整天对埃及许多人口稠密的城镇滥施轰炸。埃及的宗教寺院和和平居民都成了英法空军袭击的目标。
    埃及军方11月2日晚间发表的公报说，英法飞机在轰炸开罗市的时候，直接投弹炸中了一所寺院。这一天各地共有一百零四个和平居民被炸死，四十多人受伤。
    据埃及陆军司令部在11月2日早些时候发表的第十三号公报说：“过去二十四小时中，英法轰炸机对埃及市镇的空袭次数共为四十二次。飞机一直对人口稠密的市镇猛烈攻击。还不知道全部损失，但是对苏伊士城的一次空袭的结果之一是有一艘大渔船正好在运河入口处被英法炸弹击沉，以致入口被封闭。”
    英法的飞机遭到埃及空军和制空炮火的猛烈拦击。合众社驻开罗记者在报道他所目击的一次空袭时说，当英国飞机尖叫着越过开罗上空的时候，“埃及高射炮喷出了猛烈的炮火，有一架飞机被击中”，在城外坠毁。
    埃及军方的公报说，这一天共有十四架英法飞机被击落。据中东通讯社报道，这十四架飞机中的九架是在开罗被击落的。此外，在亚历山大港和塞得港各击落两架，在尼罗河三角洲击落一架。
