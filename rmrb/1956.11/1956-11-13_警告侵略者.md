    Warning to the Aggressors
    TASS was authorized on November 10 to issue a statement announcing the attitude of the Soviet leadership towards the current situation in Egypt and the Near East. The statement, after pointing out the need to be vigilant against the plot of the British and French aggressors to launch a large-scale war of aggression against Egypt and other countries in the Near East, stated that if Britain, France, and Israel violate the United Nations resolutions, do not withdraw their troops from Egypt, and accumulate forces, creating the danger of renewed military action, then the relevant Soviet authorities will not prevent volunteers from going to Egypt to participate in the Egyptian people's struggle for independence. This is a timely warning to the British, French, and Israeli aggressors. We fully support this solemn statement by the Soviet Union. The Chinese government and people have recently pointed out more than once that the British, French, and Israeli aggressors must immediately withdraw from Egypt, and China cannot sit idly by while Egypt's sovereignty is violated in any form; in order to support Egypt, the Chinese people have begun to take a series of practical measures, including registering volunteers to aid Egypt. These, as well as the surging aid-to-Egypt movements in other Asian and African countries and other parts of the world, should be able to prompt the British, French, and Israeli aggressors, who are attempting to continue and expand their aggression, to wake up in time.
    It has been a week since Britain, France, and Israel announced their agreement to a ceasefire. However, they have only offered empty lies and have not ceased their actual acts of aggression. After announcing the ceasefire, Britain and France continued to bomb and attack Egyptian troops and residents in Port Said, continued to send reinforcements to the Mediterranean and Port Said, and attempted to use Port Said as a bridgehead for further expanding their aggression. They continue to create various excuses for their unwillingness to withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory. After being forced to agree to withdraw troops from Egyptian territory, Israel is now clamoring to forcibly occupy the Gaza Strip. These facts give people reason to suspect that their announcement of a ceasefire is merely a delaying tactic, aimed at deceiving the people of Egypt and the world in order to gain time and a breathing space to relaunch a more ferocious attack on Egypt and other countries in the Near East.
    The facts are now becoming increasingly clear that this attitude of Britain, France, and Israel is being encouraged and supported by the United States. The United States is now actively supporting the United Nations Emergency Force plan, while not firmly demanding the immediate withdrawal of the British, French, and Israeli invading forces. It is consciously creating a situation in which the United Nations Emergency Force will replace the British, French, and Israeli invading forces, in order to realize its long-planned "international control" of the Suez Canal. To support the British and French invading forces, the United States has announced that its military forces have entered a so-called "state of alert" and has increased its naval forces in the Mediterranean. It is attempting to use the shadow of expanding the war to intimidate Egypt and other Asian and African countries, forcing them to give in to the fait accompli created by the collusion of the United States, Britain, and France.
    However, peace cannot be obtained through humiliation. Concessions to aggressors will only arouse the aggressors' greater appetite, and the result will be a more serious disruption of peace. In order to save peace, it is now necessary to force the aggressors to withdraw from Egyptian territory. President Nasser said in a speech at Al-Azhar University in Cairo on November 9: "The Suez Canal will not begin to operate as long as there is a single foreign soldier on Egyptian territory." The government leaders of the Soviet Union, China, India, and other Asian and African countries, as well as government officials and politicians, have also unanimously demanded the immediate withdrawal of British, French, and Israeli troops from Egyptian territory. This is because everyone recognizes that as long as the aggressors have not left Egypt, peace is in danger.
    The Egyptian people and all peace-loving people of the world have no illusions about the aggressors. They are vigilantly watching every step the aggressors take to continue and expand their aggression, and are determined to stop it. This determination is expressed in President Nasser's speech and in the broadcast message of Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali, and is also expressed in the attitude expressed by the Soviet leadership through TASS and in the activities of the Chinese People's Committee to Support Egypt Against Aggression. The British and French aggressors would do well not to have any illusions about this determination of the Egyptian people and the world's peace forces. If the British and French aggressors suffered heavy losses in their invasion of Egypt because they underestimated the strength of the Egyptian people, then underestimating the strength of the peace-loving people of the world will certainly bring a disastrous blow to the aggressors.

    警告侵略者
    塔斯社在11月10日受权发表声明，宣布了苏联领导人士对目前埃及和近东局势的态度。声明在指出必须警惕英、法侵略者重新对埃及和近东其他国家进行大规模侵略战争的阴谋以后说，苏联领导人士指出，如果英国法国和以色列违背联合国决议，不把军队撤出埃及，并且积蓄力量，造成军事行动再起的危险，那么，苏联有关机关就将不阻止志愿人员去埃及参加埃及人民争取独立的斗争。这是对于英、法、以侵略者的一个及时的警告。我们完全支持苏联这一严正表示。中国政府和人民最近曾不止一次地指出英、法、以侵略者必须立即从埃及撤退，中国将不能坐视埃及的主权遭受任何形式的侵犯；为了支援埃及，中国人民已经着手采取一系列的实际措施，包括登记志愿援埃的人员在内。这一些以及在其他亚非国家和世界其他地区风起云涌的援埃运动应当能够促使企图继续和扩大侵略的英、法、以色列侵略者及时醒悟。
    英、法和以色列宣布同意停火已经有一个星期了。但是，它们只提出了空洞的谎言，而没有停止侵略的实际表现。英法在宣布停火以后，仍然在塞得港轰炸和攻击埃及的军队和居民，仍然在把增援的军队开往地中海和塞得港，并且企图把塞得港作为它们进一步扩大侵略的桥头堡。它们仍然在制造种种借口，不愿意撤退在埃及领土上的军队。以色列在被迫同意从埃及领土上撤退军队以后，又在叫嚣要强占加沙地区。这些事实使人们有理由怀疑，它们宣布停火，只不过是一种缓兵之计，目的是想欺骗埃及和全世界的人民，以便取得时间和喘息的机会，来重新发动对埃及和其他中近东国家的更凶恶的进攻。
    现在的事实是越来越清楚了，英、法、以色列的这种态度，是受到美国的鼓励和支持的。美国现在一面积极支持联合国紧急部队计划，一面并不坚决要求英、法、以色列侵略军队立即撤退。它正在有意识地制造用联合国紧急部队接替英、法、以色列侵略军的局面，好实现它筹谋已久的“国际管制”苏伊士运河的计划。为了给英、法侵略军队撑腰，美国已经宣布它的军事力量进入所谓“戒备状态”，并且增加了在地中海的海军兵力。它企图用扩大战争的阴影来恫吓埃及和其它亚非国家，迫使它们在美、英、法串通造成的既成事实前面让步。
    但是，和平是不能以屈辱求得的。对侵略者的让步，只能引起侵略者更大的胃口，其结果将是和平遭到更严重的破坏。为了拯救和平，现在必须迫使侵略者退出埃及的领土。纳赛尔总统11月9日在开罗爱资哈尔大学发表演说时说：“只要埃及领土上还有一名外国兵，苏伊士运河就不会开始通航。”苏联、中国、印度的政府领袖和其他亚非国家的政府和政治家，也一致地提出了英、法、以色列军队立即从埃及领土上撤退的要求。这是因为大家都认识到，只要侵略者还没有离开埃及，和平就处在危险中。
    埃及人民和全世界爱好和平的人民对于侵略者并不抱有任何幻想。他们正在警惕地注视着侵略者继续和扩大侵略的每一步行动，并且决心加以制止。这种决心表现在纳赛尔总统的演说中和叙利亚总理阿萨利的广播文告中，也表现在苏联领导人士通过塔斯社所表示的态度和中国人民支援埃及反抗侵略委员会的活动中。对于埃及人民和世界和平力量的这种决心，英、法侵略者最好也不要抱有任何幻想。如果说，英、法侵略者曾经因为低估了埃及人民的力量而在侵犯埃及的行动中遭到了惨重的损失，那末，低估全世界爱好和平的人民的力量就一定将使侵略者遭到灾难性的打击。
