    New Mongolian language learning has developed into a widespread mass movement in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Since July of this year, approximately 100,000 people throughout the region have participated in learning the New Mongolian script, and approximately 7,000 trained teachers are engaged in teaching the New Mongolian language in government offices, schools, and among the masses. All Mongolian students enrolled in the first grade of primary school this summer are using textbooks in the New Mongolian script.
    The New Mongolian script is a horizontally written language based on the Slavic alphabet used in the Mongolian People's Republic. It is closer to the spoken language of the masses than the old Mongolian script, and has fewer letters, making it easier for the broad masses to master. An illiterate person can read ordinary books and periodicals after half a year of study. In order to carry out this language reform, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region conducted lengthy deliberation and preparation, trained a large number of teachers, and printed more than one million copies of New Mongolian textbooks. The People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also issued reward measures for using and learning the Mongolian language. The Propaganda Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China also stipulated that staff in government offices learning the New Mongolian language can temporarily suspend their theoretical and cultural studies. Currently, over 1,200 Mongolian cadres and over 100 Han cadres in the Party and government organs at the autonomous region level alone are participating in learning the New Mongolian language. According to the plan of the Inner Mongolia Language Reform Committee, the New Mongolian language will be the common language of the autonomous region in three years.

    内蒙古自治区十万人参加新蒙文学习
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区的新蒙文学习已经形成了一个广泛的群众性运动。从今年7月份开始到现在，全区约有十万人参加了新蒙文学习，约有七千名经过训练的教师在机关、学校和群众中担任新蒙文的教学工作。在今年暑期招收的小学一年级蒙古族学生，全部使用了新蒙文课本。
    新蒙文是在蒙古人民共和国通行的用斯拉夫字母拼音的横写文字，它比较旧蒙文更接近群众语言，字母也较少，容易为广大群众所掌握。一个不识字的人，经过半年学习，就可以阅读普通书刊。内蒙古自治区为进行这项文字改革工作，曾进行了长时间的酝酿和准备，训练了大批教师，印刷了一百多万册新蒙文课本。内蒙古自治区人民委员会还发布了使用和学习蒙文的奖励办法。中共内蒙古自治区委员会宣传部还规定机关学习新蒙文的工作人员，可以暂时停止理论和文化学习。现在仅自治区一级的党、政机关里就有一千二百多蒙古族干部和一百多汉族干部参加了新蒙文的学习。根据内蒙古文字改革委员会的计划，三年以后，将以新蒙文作为自治区的通用文字。
