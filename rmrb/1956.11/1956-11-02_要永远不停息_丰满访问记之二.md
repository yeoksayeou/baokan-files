    To Never Stop
    ——A Visit to Fengman, Part Two
    By Our Reporter Chen Ji
    The electric lights in the Fengman valley burn all night; the machines turning at the Fengman Hydropower Station cannot be interrupted.
    Standing on the Fengman dam, we saw the high-voltage power lines extending from the power station like black ropes, climbing over the top of the dam, hanging on iron towers tens of meters high, branching into two routes, crossing mountain peaks and fields, connecting to Jilin, Changchun, Harbin, Fushun, Shenyang, and Anshan, uniting these industrial cities with Fengman to form the longest and most powerful power grid in Northeast China. We heard the rustling sound of the high-voltage power lines and thought of the power generated by Fengman being transmitted to Anshan's large-scale steel rolling plants, turning countless machine tools in Shenyang. We felt that the Fengman Hydropower Station was like a heart, beating day and night. If it stopped beating, it would mean the interruption of production in many factories.
    The workers of the Fengman Hydropower Station understand the weight of their labor. Each of them has the words "Safety First" engraved on their hearts, regarding all accidents as their most vicious enemies.
    Walking into the main switchboard room, a multitude of signs and meters, countless buttons and circuits, came into view. The main switchboard room is the nerve center controlling the entire power station. The work here requires calmness, decisiveness, meticulousness, and caution. A moment of carelessness can have terrible consequences. Engineer Zhao Changhai was not on duty today, but when he saw us, he said without waiting for us to ask, "We Fengman people are never careless in our work. Even if a small mistake doesn't affect the safe transmission of electricity, we'll still feel bad for days and have trouble sleeping. Some people say that working at night is difficult. Actually, we're used to night shifts. No one has ever had a major accident on the night shift. As long as we concentrate, we won't make mistakes." As he said this, he looked at us. I asked him: "What difficulties are there in ensuring safety?" He immediately told me: "The only difficulty is to quickly learn new technologies and master new equipment. Without mastering new technologies, safe production is not reliable."
    At first, I did not understand the profound meaning of his last sentence; later, I learned about the history of the Fengman Hydropower Station and understood that safe production requires not only compliance with labor discipline, but also knowledge of new technologies. Without understanding new technologies, managing such a modern power station is a great hardship. In recent years, the Fengman Hydropower Station has taken a roundabout route in terms of safety in production. Before 1953, the equipment at the Fengman Hydropower Station was still the old equipment from the puppet Manchukuo era. The workers were familiar with the old equipment and managed it well. There were no accidents, and they even created the glorious record of one thousand days without accidents. However, after 1953, new, fully automated equipment began to be installed, and the old semi-automated equipment was gradually refitted. In the face of the new equipment, new technologies were needed. Without new technologies, even the best fully automated equipment could not be managed well. Some leaders did not see this point clearly, but were satisfied with past achievements and did not regard mastering new technologies as a historic task. They themselves did not read the technical documents related to the new equipment, nor did they systematically organize the workers to familiarize themselves with the new equipment through equipment installation and reconstruction work. After the new equipment was put into production, they were afraid to repair it when it malfunctioned. A new type of air switch controlling high-voltage power lines, lacking inspection and maintenance, exploded. The precision machinery of the new type of water turbine governor had not been completely inspected and repaired after running for two years. The automatic paralleling device was almost idle for a year before they dared to use it. Although the new equipment was very good, it would deteriorate if it lacked inspection and maintenance. Accidents involving new equipment were the most frequent, accounting for 64.3% of all accidents. And the root cause of the accidents was the lack of mastery of new technologies.
    At the end of 1955, under the education of the Party, the leaders of the Fengman Hydropower Station criticized the past mistakes of not striving to learn new technologies, united all the workers, and marched toward new technologies. It has now been more than ten months since any major accidents have occurred.
    To advance towards new technologies, it is necessary to fight against all kinds of conservative thinking, especially to oppose the erroneous thinking of not believing in the masses.
    The people of the Fengman Hydropower Station all know the tortuous path of Jia Fuchen, a national advanced producer, in mastering new technologies.
    Jia Fuchen is a stubborn old worker who has always loved to study new technologies, inquire about various new equipment, and has been working for twenty-seven years, proficient in mechanical repair work. At the end of 1954, the air compressor often malfunctioned. Jia Fuchen sat beside the compressor every day, pondering, sometimes getting up in the middle of the night, checking the compressor for faults for more than ten hours at a stretch. He thought over and over, wanting to install a cooling water device beside the compressor to reduce the high temperature and prevent burnout accidents. He told Bai Ziming, the director of the water turbine division, about this method. Bai Ziming felt: "What can we do about the defects of the new equipment!" He replied in an indifferent tone: "Well, let's study it further." Later, Soviet experts invited from Anshan improved some devices of the compressor, but still did not solve the problem of high temperature. Jia Fuchen told the Soviet experts about his method. The Soviet experts agreed and suggested that the leadership adopt it. However, the chief engineer and the director of the water turbine division always thought that the new equipment was complicated and that the workers' methods were not necessarily reliable.
    The compressor continued to malfunction as usual. There were twenty-three failures in 1955. Bai Ziming became anxious, urging Jia Fuchen to repair it day and night. If he couldn't fix it during the day, he would work overtime at night. At that time, the factory also sent people to various places to buy high-temperature compressor oil to prevent accidents. However, high-temperature oil was expensive and could not be bought. Jia Fuchen was very angry and told Vice Director Zhao Qingfu. At this time, it was time to oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, and the leadership supported Jia Fuchen's suggestion and conducted experiments, which proved successful. The problem of equipment accidents was finally solved. Experts from the German Democratic Republic also came to learn about Jia Fuchen's experience.
    This fact has educated many leaders to believe in the power of the workers. Mastering new equipment is not a mysterious matter.
    Now the Fengman Hydropower Station has taken a big step forward in mastering new equipment. The new equipment that they did not dare to repair in the past is now being disassembled and overhauled. The automated equipment that they did not dare to touch in the past is no longer mysterious. Learning new technologies has become a trend. Every morning and evening, offices become classrooms, and the sounds of lectures rise and fall. Some new workers who have only been working for two or three years have also become the main force in the maintenance of new equipment; more than twenty technicians have been promoted to directors, technicians, and engineers; young technicians who have recently graduated from universities can also work independently. Vice Director Zhao Qingfu and Division Director Liu Shiqing, who were old workers in the past, are now effectively leading the work of the hydropower station. Duty engineers Jia Zhuyuan and Zhao Changhai were workers a few years ago, and now they are good engineers familiar with new technologies.
    The equipment of the Fengman Hydropower Station is still being improved. The degree of automation is constantly increasing. Last year, they felt it was very novel to use buttons to start the machines; this year, they are going to use low-frequency self-starting devices, which can start the machines themselves without anyone having to touch them. In the past, they had automatic paralleling devices, but they did not dare to use them; recently, they have refitted automatic devices that do not require human intervention. The Fengman workers have just learned to use new equipment, and they have encountered even newer equipment. They need to learn quickly and break through new technical fortresses. The people of Fengman will not lag behind. The current of Fengman will absolutely not stop.

    要永远不停息
    ——丰满访问记之二
  　本报记者　陈迹
    丰满山谷里的电灯，是彻夜不灭的；丰满水电站转动的机器，是不能中断的。
    我们站在丰满大堤坝上，看见高压输电线，从电站伸出来，像一条条乌黑的绳索，爬过坝顶，挂到几十公尺高的铁塔上去，分成两路，越出山峰，跨过田野，通往吉林，长春、哈尔滨、抚顺、沈阳和鞍山，把这些工业城市和丰满联成一体，组成最长的东北地区强大电网。我们听见高压输电线的沙沙声响，想到丰满发出的电力，传进了鞍山大型轧钢厂，转动了沈阳无数的机床。我们感到丰满水电站是颗心脏，它日夜不停地跳动。它一停止跳动，就意味着许多工厂生产的中断。
    丰满水电站职工懂得他们劳动的分量。他们每个人心上都刻着“安全第一”的字样，把一切事故都看成是自己的最凶恶的敌人。
    走进总配电盘室，各式的标志和仪表，无数的电钮和线路，涌现出来。总配电盘室是控制整个电站的神经枢纽。这里的工作，需要冷静果断、细心谨慎。一不小心，后果是可怕的。工程师赵长海今天不值班，看见我们，不等我们问，就说道：“我们丰满人工作都不马虎。那怕在小动作上出个差错，不影响安全送电，我们也要难过几天，睡不好觉。有人说：夜间工作很困难。“其实，夜间值班，我们都习惯了。谁在夜班也没出大事故。只要精神集中，就出不了岔儿。”他说到这里，望望我们。我问他：要保证安全，还有什么困难。他随即告诉我：“困难么，只有一条，就是赶快学习新技术，掌握新设备。不掌握新技术，安全生产不牢靠。”
    我起先不理解他最后这句话的深刻意义；后来我了解了丰满水电站的历史，才懂得：安全生产，不光需要遵守劳动纪律，更需要懂得新技术。不懂新技术，要管理这样现代化的大电站，是要吃苦头的。最近几年，丰满水电站在安全生产上，曾经走过一段弯路。在1953年以前，丰满水电站的设备，都还是伪满时期的旧设备。职工们熟悉旧设备，管理得很好，没有出事故，还创造过一千天无事故的光荣纪录，但是，1953年以后，新的完全自动化设备开始安装，旧的半自动化设备逐渐改装。在新的设备面前，需要新的技术。缺少新技术，就是再好的完全自动化设备，也管不好。有些领导人员没有看清这一点，却满足过去的成绩，没有把掌握新技术看成是历史性的任务。他们自己没有阅读有关新设备的技术文件，又没有组织职工系统地通过设备安装和改建工作，来熟悉新设备。等到新设备投入生产以后，出了毛病，不敢修理。一种新的控制高压输电线的空气开关，缺少检修和维护，发生爆炸事故。新式的水轮机调速器的精密机械，运行了两年，都没有进行全部检查和检修。自动的并列装置，几乎闲置了一年，才敢使用。新设备虽然很好，但是如果缺乏检修和维护，也会变坏。新设备发生的事故最多，占全部事故总数64.3％。而事故发生的根源，就在于新技术掌握不好。
    1955年末，丰满水电站领导人员在党的教育下，批判过去不努力学习新技术的错误，团结全体职工，向新技术进军。现在已经有十个多月，没有再发生大事故了。
    向新技术进军，要同形形色色的保守思想作斗争，尤其要反对不相信群众的错误思想。
    丰满水电站人们都知道全国先进生产者贾福臣掌握新技术的曲折道路。
    贾福臣是个倔强的老工人，一向喜爱钻研新技术，打听各种新设备，干了二十七年的活，精通机械修理工作。1954年末，空气压缩机常常出毛病。贾福臣天天坐在压缩机旁琢磨，有时候半夜三更起床，一连十几个小时，检查压缩机的毛病。他左思右想，想要在压缩机旁装个冷却水的设备，降低高温，防止烧坏事故。他把这个办法，告诉水轮分场主任白自明。白自明觉得：
  “新设备的缺陷，我们有什么办法！”他爱理不理地答道：“嗯，再研究吧。”后来，从鞍山请来的苏联专家，改进了压缩机的一些装置，也还是没有解决温度高的问题。贾福臣把自己的办法告诉苏联专家。苏联专家很同意，并且建议领导方面采纳。可是总工程师和水轮分场主任总以为新设备复杂，工人的办法不一定可靠。
    压缩机照常出毛病。1955年出了二十三次故障。白自明着急了，日夜催促贾福臣修理，白天修不好，晚上加班加点。当时，厂里还派人到各地购买高温压缩机油，来防止事故。但是高温机油又贵又买不到。贾福臣很气愤，告诉副厂长赵庆夫。这时候，正好要反对右倾保守思想，领导方面才支持了贾福臣建议，并且进行试验，果真成功了。设备事故问题，终于解决了。德意志民主共和国也派来专家，了解贾福臣的经验。
    这个事实，教育了许多领导人员，要相信工人的力量。掌握新设备，不是神秘的事情。
    现在丰满水电站在掌握新设备上，前进了一大步。过去不敢检修的新设备，现在被拆开来，大修一番。过去不敢动的自动化设备，也不神秘了。学习新技术，已经成了风气。每天早晨和夜晚，办公室变成课堂，讲课的声音此起彼伏。一些才工作两三年的新工人，也成了新设备检修的主力军；二十多名技工，被提升为主任、技师和工程师；从大学出来不久的年轻技术员，也能独立工作。副厂长赵庆夫、分场主任刘世清，过去都是老工人，如今有效地领导着水电站工作。值班工程师贾柱远、赵长海几年前是工人，现在已经是熟悉新技术的好工程师。
    丰满水电站的设备，还在改进。自动化的程度，不断提高。去年改用电钮起动机器，觉得很新鲜；今年又要改用低周波自起动装置，根本不要人去动，就能自己起动机器。以往有了自动并列装置，都还不敢用；最近又改装了不要人管的自动装置。丰满职工刚刚学会使用新设备，又遇到了更新的设备。他们需要赶快学习，攻破新的技术堡垒。丰满人是不会落后的。丰满的电流是绝对不会停息的。
