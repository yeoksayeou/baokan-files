    Also on Buying Books
    Ruò Wàng
    Xī Dì's "Wandering Through the Book Forest," serialized in the "People's Daily," has a section specifically discussing buying books. He criticized the behavior of many people who rush into bookstores and, without even asking what the book is about, say sweepingly, "Give me one of each." It's good to point out such absurd behavior in a timely manner. What I want to discuss here is that it is indeed difficult to choose books in bookstores nowadays. When we open a book, we first look at the "content summary," but the content summaries are all the same few sentences, not exceeding two hundred words. If you want to find a typical example of boilerplate writing, I suggest you appreciate the content summaries of various books.
    Books published in the past usually had a preface at the beginning, sometimes written by someone else; if there was no preface, there was an "afterword" or "postscript" at the end. This was very helpful for people buying books. Having a preface at the beginning is like having a collar on a shirt. In recent years, however, we rarely see prefaces or afterwords. Instead, we have many poorly written content summaries. I doubt if anyone even reads these summaries. I don't think this is progress, but regression.
    "Prefaces" or "afterwords" can tell readers how the book was written; or, like Lu Xun in the "afterword" to his collection of essays, explain what fate some of his articles had suffered, and his state of mind when writing a certain article. When we study the "prefaces" written by classical writers in their great works, we can more clearly understand the author's conception and the theme of the creation; this is the most precious material for literary historians. Marx's "Preface" to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy is the starting point of Marxist economics and the materialist conception of history, the essence of Marxist theory. It is absolutely wrong to regard writing "prefaces" or "afterwords" as a waste. It is said that the reason why publications don't have "prefaces" or "afterwords" is not to save money, but because the authors themselves have concerns: they are afraid of revealing self-appreciating emotions in the "preface" and "afterword." If they ask someone else to write it, others also feel that praising the works of close friends may give the impression of being in a small circle; if the praise is inappropriate and the book is criticized, even the person who wrote the preface will be implicated. Who wants to provoke trouble and go the extra mile? It is under such complex emotions that the monotonous "content summary" has emerged, while the "preface" and "afterword" have disappeared.
    I am not advocating that every book must have a "preface" and "afterword." Some books can be written without a preface or afterword. I am only thinking about the people who buy books. Authors may as well boldly speak directly to readers at the beginning and end of the book, saying whatever they want to say. It is also permissible to ask someone to write a preface; if it is biased, discussions can be held. Of course, self-promotion and advertising-style confessions should not be written. As for introducing the content of one's work to readers in a confident tone, I don't think this should be regarded as "self-appreciation" or "self-praise." If he has no confidence, how can he write this book?

    也谈买书
    若望
    西谛在“人民日报”上连载的“漫步书林”，有一节专门谈到买书；他批评了有许多人跑进书店，连书的内容是什么也不问，就大包大揽的说：“每一种给我挑一本”。及时指出这种近乎荒唐的行径是很有好处的。我这里谈的是目下走进书店挑选书籍也确实困难，当我们翻开一本书来，首先看“内容提要”，而内容提要是千篇一律的几句话，不超过二百字。如果要寻找典型的八股文字，我提议诸位不妨去领略一下各书的内容提要。
    过去出的书，一般的在卷首都有一篇序，有的是别人写的序；如果没有序，在书后有“跋”或“后记”之类。这对于买书的人有很大的好处。卷首有序就好比穿衣裳有领子是一样。近几年来，却很少看到有序或后记。取而代之的是不少写得不好的内容提要。我怀疑这些提要倒底有没有人要看。我觉得这不是进步现象，而是倒退。
    “序”或“后记”可以告诉读者这本书怎样写成的；或者像鲁迅在他的杂文集后面的“后记”中，说明他的一些文章遭到过什么样的命运，他在写某篇文章时的心境如何；我们研究古典作家在他们的巨著上写的“序言”，可以更明确了解作者的构思和创作的主题；这对于文学史家是最珍贵的材料。马克思的政治经济学批判的“序言”，乃是马克思主义经济学和唯物史观的出发点，是马克思主义理论的精髓所在。把写“序”或“跋”看做浪费是万万不可的。据说出版物上面不写“序”或“后记”，倒并不是为了节约；而是著作人本身有顾虑：怕在“序”和“后记”中流露自我欣赏的情绪；如果请别人写吧；别人也感到赞扬知己朋友的作品，恐有小圈子之嫌；如果赞扬不当，该书受到批判，连代序的人也得一同连累，谁愿意招惹是非，多此一举呢？在这样错综复杂的情绪之下，才出现了千篇一律的“内容提要”；而“序”和“跋”乃宣告失踪。
    我倒并不主张每本书一定要有“序”和“后记”，有些书是可以不写序或跋的。我只是为了买书的人着想，作者不妨在卷首和书后大胆的向读者直接说话，要说什么就说什么。请人写序也未始不可，写得有偏颇不妨展开讨论。当然，那种自我捧场和广告式的告白是不应该写进去的。至于对自己的作品以自信的口吻向读者介绍其中的内容，我认为不能把这当做“自我欣赏”或“自我表扬”。如果没有自信，他能写得出这本书来吗？
