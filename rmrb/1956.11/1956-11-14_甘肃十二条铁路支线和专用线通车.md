Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, November 13th. Twelve of the fifteen railway branch lines and dedicated lines built in Gansu Province this year to serve economic construction have been completed and opened to traffic; the remaining three are under construction of the roadbed and will soon be laid with tracks.

These lines are distributed on both sides of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang, Longhai, and Baotou-Lanzhou railway trunk lines. After the Lanzhou-Shimen'gou Coal Mine railway opened to traffic, it has used trains to transport a large amount of coal to support the economic construction of Lanzhou. In the past, when horse-drawn carts were used for transportation, a large amount of coal was backlogged in the mining area because the transportation capacity was too low, but this phenomenon has now been eliminated. Since the opening of the Yumen Oilfield branch line and the dedicated lines of the Lanzhou Refinery and Thermal Power Plant, tens of thousands of tons of building materials and huge machines have been transported directly to the construction site, ensuring the progress of capital construction projects in these areas.

    甘肃十二条铁路支线和专用线通车
    新华社兰州13日电　甘肃省今年修筑的十五条为经济建设服务的铁路支线和专用线，已经有十二条完工通车；其余三条正在修筑路基，不久也将铺设轨道。
    这些线路分布在兰新、陇海、包兰等铁路干线的两侧。兰州—石门沟煤矿铁路通车以后，已经利用火车运输了大量煤炭支援兰州市的经济建设。过去利用马车运输的时候，因为运输能力太低，大量煤炭积压在矿区运不出来，现在这种现象已经消除。玉门油矿支线和兰州炼油厂、热电站等专用线通车以来，把成千上万吨的建筑器材和巨大机器直接运到施工现场，保证了这些地区基本建设工程的进展。
