    On the Heilongjiang River, a Conduit of Sino-Soviet Friendship
    Professor Feng Jinglan, Director of the Ore Deposit Research Section, Beijing Institute of Geology

    Because I participated in the Sino-Soviet joint comprehensive expedition to the Heilongjiang River conducted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Academy of Sciences this summer, we repeatedly traveled and surveyed along the Sino-Soviet border on the Heilongjiang River for two months.
    During the seven-thousand-li journey from Manzhouli to Bo Li (Khabarovsk), from the Hulunbuir Grassland to the Sanjiang Plain wetlands, we further strengthened the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and gained a preliminary understanding of the Heilongjiang River as a conduit of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    This broad and steady river, symbolizing "peace," is the longest river in the world used as a boundary between two great nations. It is a great river with a length close to the Yellow River, a water volume exceeding the Pearl River, a drainage area approaching the Yangtze River, and a general width exceeding the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, or the Pearl River.
    On this river, one can see the relics of ancient Chinese culture (the Bo Li Museum houses Chinese coins, Chinese-style armor, and Chinese epitaphs excavated from ancient tombs near Bo Li); one can hear the heroic and moving stories of the Chinese and Soviet people fighting against Japanese imperialist aggression in 1919 and 1945; one can recognize the abundant resources of forests, pastures, agriculture, and minerals along the river; and one can dream of the beautiful prospects of social prosperity that the completion of the Heilongjiang Hydropower Station will bring about with its vast amounts of light and heat.
    However, what is most touching and unforgettable is the deep and unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and between the scientists of the two countries.
    When Chinese and Soviet scientists presented the flowers they collected from the Inner Mongolian grasslands to the graves of the Soviet soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the liberation of Hailar City and the liberation of Northeast China; when the working people along the river enthusiastically waved and cheered at the expedition team; when teams of elementary school students delivered pictures filled with friendly words to the expedition members; when girls sent bouquets of flowers from all directions into the arms of the members; when Young Pioneers tied their most precious red scarves around the necks of the members and pinned their Young Pioneer badges on their lapels; when provincial governors, provincial party secretaries, and border defense officers accompanied the team to visit cityscapes, factories, and schools, and greeted them or bid farewell hundreds of miles away at the border; when thousands of spectators in theaters, cinemas, circuses, and dance halls stood up in unison and applauded warmly to pay tribute to the expedition team; when, amid the merriment of drinking, loud singing, and dancing in embrace; whether they were Soviet or Chinese, workers or peasants, hydrologists, hydro-energy experts, soil scientists, foresters, geologists, newspaper reporters, sailors, or translators, their deep and ardent emotions naturally and closely merged together. They did not seem like strangers, nor like new acquaintances, but like "old friends meeting in a foreign land."
    During these cool and intense two months, Chinese and Soviet scientists lived together, observed together, and worked together; they learned from each other, debated with each other, and criticized each other; they not only understood the characteristics of the Heilongjiang River, but also understood the personality of each team member; they not only clarified the truth, but also strengthened their friendship; because everyone had only one common great goal and slogan, which was to strive to study and develop all the natural resources of the Heilongjiang River and its basin.
    However, it should also be pointed out that the Heilongjiang River system has both advantages and disadvantages for the construction of giant hydropower stations. Its main advantages are: abundant water volume, low sediment content, and small inundation losses; while its main disadvantages are: small riverbed drop, few giant reservoirs, and currently low electricity demand. Especially in China, it is very necessary to vigorously develop geological surveys and mineral exploration in the future, determine the distribution of heavy industrial bases, and expand the electricity market.
    In the current situation, the geological survey work in the Amur River (the name of the Heilongjiang River in the Soviet Union) region of the Soviet Far East has been strengthened since 1946, which is probably ten years earlier than China's geological survey work in the Heilongjiang River region. In order to jointly develop this international friendship and exchange river, the Heilongjiang River, we must redouble our efforts and complete the survey of natural resources on the south bank of the Heilongjiang River as soon as possible, in order to combine our country's plan to vigorously develop the Northeast with our great neighbor's plan to develop the productive forces of the Far East, strengthen the exchange of Sino-Soviet friendship, and make concrete contributions to the happiness and prosperity of the thousands of Chinese and Soviet residents on both sides of the Heilongjiang River.
    All the members of the Sino-Soviet scientific expedition also jointly realized that only after the success of the great October Revolution and the success of the Chinese Revolution, is it necessary and possible to transform the Heilongjiang River, which has always isolated the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, into an object of Sino-Soviet friendship exchange and Sino-Soviet joint construction. From this point of view, commemorating the great October Revolution Day today has a more profound significance for the people of China and the Soviet Union.

### 在中苏友谊交流的黑龙江上

    在中苏友谊交流的黑龙江上
    北京地质学院矿床教研室主任教授　冯景兰
    因为参加中国科学院和苏联科学院今年夏季所进行的黑龙江综合考察工作，我们在黑龙江沿岸的中苏边境上，反复来往旅行考察了两个月。
    从满洲里到伯力，从呼伦贝尔草原到三江口湿地的七千里长途旅行中，我们进一步加强了中苏人民间的友谊，并且也初步认识了中苏友谊交流的黑龙江。
    这条象征着“和平”的宽广而稳静的河流，是世界上以河道作为两个大国分界的最长的河流，是长度近于黄河，水量超过珠江，流域面积接近长江，而一般宽度超过黄河、长江、或珠江的伟大河流。
    在这条河流上，可以看到我国古代文化的遗迹（伯力博物馆收藏有从伯力市附近古墓中所掘出的中国钱币、中国式铠甲和中文墓志铭）；可以听到中苏人民在1919年和1945年两度抗击日本帝国主义侵略的可歌可泣的英勇故事；可以认识到沿江林、牧、农、矿等丰富的资源；也可以梦想到黑龙江水电站建成后发出大量光和热所能引起的社会繁荣的美好远景。
    但是，最使人感动和最使人难忘的是中苏两国人民、中苏两国的科学家们中间的深厚而牢不可破的友谊。
    当中苏科学家们把他们从内蒙古草原所采集的鲜花献给为解放海拉尔市、为解放东北而贡献出自己生命的苏军将士墓的时候；当沿岸劳动人民向考察队热烈招手欢呼的时候；当成队的小学生向考察队员们送递写满了友好词句的画片的时候；当少女们把束束鲜花从四面八方送到队员们的怀抱的时候；当少先队员把他们最宝贵的红领巾系在队员们颈上和把他们的少先队员章别在队员们的衣襟上的时候；当省长、省委书记、边防军官陪同参观市容、工厂、学校，并迎送到百里以外的国境线上握手致意或告别的时候；当剧场、电影院、马戏场、跳舞厅千百观众一致起立热烈鼓掌向考察队致敬的时候；当酒酣耳热，高声歌唱和大家拥抱起舞的时候；不论是苏联人，是中国人，是工人，是农民，是水文学家，是水能学家，是土壤学家，是森林学家，是地质学家，是报馆记者，是船员，是翻译员，他们深挚而热烈的情感，都自然而然地紧密地融合在一起。他们看起来并不像是陌生，并不像是新交，而像是“万里他乡遇故知”。
    在这凉爽而紧张的两个月期间，中苏科学家们共同生活、共同观察、共同工作；互相学习、互相辩论也互相批评；他们不仅了解了黑龙江的特点，而且也了解了每一个队员的个性；不仅阐明了真理，而且也增强了友谊；因为大家只有一个共同的伟大目标和口号，那就是为研究开发黑龙江及其流域的一切天然资源而奋斗。
    但是也应当指出，黑龙江水系对建设巨型水电站来说，有它的优点，也有它的缺点。它的主要优点是：水量丰富，泥沙量少，湮没损失不大；而它的主要缺点是：河床落差小，巨型水库不多，现在电力需要量不大；尤其在中国方面，今后应大力发展地质普查和矿产勘探工作，确定重工业基地的分布，扩大电力市场，都是非常必要的。
    就目前情况来说，苏联远东阿穆尔河（苏联境内黑龙江的名称）地区的地质调查工作，从1946年起，就已经加强，比中国对黑龙江地区的地质调查工作，大概早作了十年。为了共同开发这个国际友谊交流之河的黑龙江，我们必须加倍努力，及早完成黑龙江南岸天然资源的调查工作，以结合我国大力发展东北的计划和我们伟大邻邦发展远东生产力的计划，加强中苏友谊的交流，为黑龙江两岸万千中苏居民的幸福和繁荣作出具体的贡献。
    中苏科学考察队的全体队员同志们也共同认识到只有在伟大十月革命成功之后，在中国革命成功之后，这条向来隔绝中苏两大民族的黑龙江，才有改变为中苏友谊交流、中苏共同建设对象的必要和可能。从这一观点来说，今天纪念伟大的十月革命节，对于中苏两国人民就具有更深刻的意义。
