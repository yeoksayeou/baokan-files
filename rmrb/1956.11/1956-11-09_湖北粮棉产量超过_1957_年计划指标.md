Xinhua News Agency report: Hubei Province has completed and exceeded the 1957 national production plan targets for grain, cotton, and soybeans ahead of schedule. The total grain output of the province is more than 21 billion jin, an increase of 11.7% over last year. Cotton production reached more than 4 million dan, an increase of 36.9% over last year. Soybeans increased by more than 44% over last year.

The biggest feature of Hubei Province's increased production this year is the significant increase in high-yield areas. Last year, the production of 1,000 jin of grain or 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu only appeared in individual areas, but this year the number of such areas has increased significantly.

Agricultural cooperation is the foundation of Hubei Province's bumper harvest this year. Agricultural technology reforms that were impossible to carry out when working individually in the past have begun this year. The province's water conservancy projects exceeded any previous year. The province's fertilizer accumulation was more than 30% higher than last year. Close planting and early sowing have also been widely promoted this year. The natural conditions in Hubei Province were better this year, but some areas also suffered from floods and droughts.

The Party and the state helped agricultural cooperatives train tens of thousands of agricultural technicians and management cadres this year. Financial and economic departments issued more than 160 million yuan in agricultural loans through loans and advance purchases.

    湖北粮棉产量超过1957年计划指标
    据新华社讯　湖北省粮食、棉花、大豆都提前和超额完成了1957年国家生产计划指标。全省的粮食总产量是二百一十亿多斤，比去年增长了11.7％。棉花产量达到了四百万担以上，比去年增长了36.9％。大豆比去年增长了44％强。
    湖北省今年增产的最大特点，是高产量地区大大增多，一亩田产一千斤粮食或一百斤皮棉，在去年还只是在个别地区出现，而今年这种地区增加很多。
    农业合作化是湖北省今年大丰收的基础。过去单干时无力进行的农业技术改革今年开始进行了。全省的水利工程超过了以往任何一年。全省积肥量比去年多30％以上。密植和早播今年也得到普遍推广。今年湖北省自然条件较好，但局部地区也曾发生过水灾和旱灾。
    党和国家今年帮助农业社训练 了成万个农业技术人员和管理干部。财经部门通过贷款和预购发放了农业贷款一亿六千多万元。
