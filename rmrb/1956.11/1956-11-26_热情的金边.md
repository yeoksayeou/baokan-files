Enthusiastic Phnom Penh
By Our Correspondent Zhan Chao

The Mekong River, like a yellow ribbon, spread out beneath the aircraft. Premier Zhou Enlai's plane began to enter Cambodian airspace. Facing the dazzling sunlight, many black dots could be seen moving forward in the distance, and soon appeared on both sides. It turned out to be eight brightly colored escort planes of the Kingdom of Cambodia, specially flown from Phnom Penh to the Cambodian-Laotian border to welcome friends from Beijing.

At 11:30 AM on the 22nd, the Chinese civil aviation plane carrying Premier Zhou Enlai gently landed at Pochentong Airport. Prince Norodom Sihanouk stepped forward quickly to greet Premier Zhou Enlai as he disembarked. The hands of two good friends, the hands of two ancient yet young nations, were clasped tightly together. This moment brought to mind not only Geneva, Bandung, and the moving scenes of Prince Norodom Sihanouk's visit to China this spring, but also the Cambodian monks Mandara and Lobha Luo, who were sent by the king to China to translate scriptures more than 1,400 years ago; the Tang Dynasty monk Yijing, who passed through Cambodia more than 1,200 years ago on his journey to seek scriptures in the south; Zhou Daguan of the Yuan Dynasty, who wrote "A Record of the Customs of Cambodia"; and Zheng He, the Ming Dynasty eunuch who sailed the seas seven times. The hands of our two nations, past, present, and future, will forever be clasped together.

After receiving flowers from nineteen Cambodian and overseas Chinese girls, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long, accompanied by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Prince Penn Nouth, and Prime Minister San Yun, walked along the specially laid red carpet and reviewed the guard of honor of the Royal Government of Cambodia. This was an unusually majestic and moving guard of honor, consisting of a military band in dark purple uniforms, royal guards in sea-blue uniforms, army soldiers in yellow uniforms, navy sailors in white uniforms, air force personnel in gray uniforms, and paratroopers in camouflage uniforms.

Everywhere at Pochentong Airport, the warm hospitality of our gracious hosts was evident. After Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long reviewed the guard of honor, they were led to a newly painted wooden platform, where they met with ministers of the Royal Government and diplomatic personnel from other countries who had been waiting there since early morning. The upper part of this platform was a typical Khmer-style temple roof, allowing people to avoid the sun. The winter in Phnom Penh felt as hot as the height of summer in Beijing. To welcome Premier Zhou Enlai, Prince Norodom Sihanouk had returned to Phnom Penh from New Delhi the night before and had arrived at Pochentong Airport early that morning to personally inspect the preparations.

Two large five-star red flags and three-tower flags were hoisted high on the airport flagpoles, fluttering in the wind. The crowds standing on both sides of the platform and outside the airport fences held up Cambodian and Chinese banners and waved the flags of both countries, repeatedly applauding the cordial greetings of Prince Penn Nouth and Premier Zhou Enlai.

Prince Norodom Sihanouk invited Premier Zhou Enlai to board an open-top car together and proceed towards downtown Phnom Penh. From Pochentong Airport to the center of Phnom Penh is about nine kilometers long, and the entire route was lined with dense crowds of people who enthusiastically cheered Premier Zhou Enlai and Prince Sihanouk, who stood smiling in the car. All government offices and schools were closed for the day, and many shops also closed voluntarily. People poured into the streets at dawn, heading towards Pochentong Airport. In a city of 300,000 people, more than 100,000 participated in the welcoming procession, and the scale of the event can be imagined. Among the welcomers were also many people from all over Cambodia's twelve provinces, even from the most remote province of Stung Treng.

The open-top car carrying Premier Zhou Enlai and Prince Sihanouk, along with other vehicles, turned from Kampuchea Road to Norodom Boulevard, Lycée Street, Sisowath Quay, and Quai de France, finally arriving at the Royal Palace at 1:30 PM. The King, Queen, and Crown Prince specially invited Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long to stay in a magnificent detached palace near their residence, while other accompanying personnel were accommodated in the Royal Residence on the banks of the Mekong River.

At 5:00 PM, King Suramarit and Queen Kossamak, with the most solemn state etiquette, received Premier Zhou Enlai and all accompanying personnel. The reception was held in the imposing Khemarin Palace - the Khmer Palace. At 8:30 PM, the King and Queen held a banquet to entertain Premier Zhou Enlai and all accompanying personnel.

Afterward, Premier Zhou Enlai and others enjoyed a beautiful classical Cambodian dance and music performance in the Royal Palace Theater. It was not until 1:30 AM that Premier Zhou and his entourage returned to the Government Building, and the crowds still lined the streets to welcome them.

Early the next day, many people had already gathered in front of the Royal Palace and the Government Building, their faces seemed familiar. Although we were visiting Cambodia for the first time, peace and friendship had long connected the Chinese and Cambodian people together.

On this day, Premier Zhou Enlai and others visited the Prime Minister's Office, the National Assembly, and the Royal Council, and toured the Silver Pagoda, the Royal School of Medicine, the Museum, and the School of Fine Arts. They received the most solemn reception in all these places. In the evening, the cars drove out of the suburbs in the cool breeze, and the people of the newly built Tonle Bati village, stretching for several kilometers, poured into the streets to welcome them.

For two days, Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage have been living in the warm and enthusiastic friendship of the people of the Cambodian capital. (Phnom Penh, November 24)

    热情的金边
    本报记者　展潮
    湄公河像一条黄色的缎带在机身下面铺展着。周恩来总理乘坐的飞机开始进入了柬埔寨的上空。迎着耀眼的阳光，可以看见远远有许多黑点在向前移动，然后很快就在左右两侧出现，原来是柬埔寨王国八架彩色灿烂的护航机，特地从金边飞到柬埔寨、老挝边境迎接来自北京的友人。
    22日上午11时30分，载着周恩来总理的中国民航机轻轻地降落在波成东机场上。诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下迅步走向前去，迎接着从飞机上下来的周恩来总理。两个好朋友的手，两个古老而又年轻的民族的手，紧紧地握在一起。这一刹那，不仅使人想起了日内瓦、想起了万隆、想起了诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下今年春天访问中国时那些动人的情景；还使人想起了一千四百多年前奉国王之命到中国译经的柬埔寨高僧曼陀罗和倮婆罗、想起了一千二百多年前南行取经路过柬埔寨的唐僧义净、想起了著有“真腊风土记”的元朝周达观、想起了七下西洋的明朝三宝太监郑和。我们两个民族的手，过去、现在和将来，将永远紧握在一起。
    接受过十九位柬埔寨和华侨少女献花以后，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理，由诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王、宾努亲王和桑云首相陪同，踏着特地铺设的红色的长地毡，一路走过来，检阅了柬埔寨王国政府的仪仗队。这是一支异常威武而动人的仪仗队。有穿着深紫色军服的军乐队，穿着海蓝色军服的御林军，穿着黄色军服的陆军，穿着白色军服的海军，穿着灰色军服的空军和穿着保护色军服的伞兵部队。
    在波成东飞机场上，处处都显示着我们殷勤好客的主人的一片热忱。周恩来总理和贺龙副总理检阅了仪仗队，便被引到油漆犹新的木质方坛上，同从早就守候在这里的王国政府大臣们和其他国家外交人员们见面。这个方坛上部是典型的高棉民族庙宇式的屋顶，人们站在这里就可以避免太阳的照射。金边的冬天，仿佛是北京盛夏似的炎热。为着迎接周恩来总理，诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下在头一天夜里从新德里赶回金边，今天又很早就来到波成东飞机场，亲自阅查了各项准备工作。
    两面大幅的五星红旗和三塔旗高悬在飞机场的旗杆上，迎风招展。站在方坛两侧和飞机场栏栅外面的人群，高举着柬埔寨文和中文标语，挥动着两国的国旗，他们一再为宾努亲王和周恩来总理亲切的祝词而鼓掌欢呼。
    诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下请周恩来总理一起登上了敞篷汽车，向金边市区前进。从波成东飞机场到金边市的中心约有九公里长，沿途尽是密密麻麻的人，他们向含笑地站在车上的周恩来总理和西哈努克亲王热烈欢呼。今天各机关学校一律休假，许多商店也自动休息，人们在黎明时就涌上了街头，流向波成东飞机场去。一个三十万人口的城市，有上十万人参加了欢迎的行列，那盛况是可以想像得到的。在欢迎者里面还有许多是从柬埔寨十二个省的各处来的，甚至连最边远的上丁省也有人来。
    周恩来总理和西哈努克亲王乘坐的敞篷汽车和其他的汽车，由贡不路转到诺罗敦大道、李吉街、诗梳屈海傍街、邦夏日街，最后在一时半到达了皇宫。国王、王后和太子特地邀请周恩来总理和贺龙副总理住在他们附近的一座富丽的离宫里，其他随行人员被安顿在湄公河畔的皇家大厦里。
    5时，柬埔寨国王苏拉玛里特和王后以最隆重的国礼，招见了周恩来总理和全体随行人员。接见礼是在巍峨的克马蓝宫——高棉宫中进行的。8时半，国王和王后举行御宴，招待周恩来总理和全体随行人员。
    随后，周恩来总理等在皇宫戏院里欣赏了柬埔寨高棉民族优美的古典歌舞节目。直到清晨一时半，当周总理和随行人员返回政府大厦时，沿途群众依然夹道迎送。
    第二天很早，在王宫和政府大厦前面就已聚集了许多人，那一张张脸孔好像在那里遇见过似的。我们虽是第一次来到柬埔寨，但是和平和友谊早就把中国人民和柬埔寨人民联结在一起了。
    这一天周恩来总理等访问了王国首相府和国民议会、王国会议，参观了银塔、王家医学校、博物馆、美术学校，在所有这些地方都受到了最隆重的接待。傍晚，汽车迎着凉风驰出郊外，绵延数公里长的顿谷新村人民都涌到街头上欢迎。
    两天来周总理和他的随行人员一直生活在柬埔寨首都人民热情洋溢的友谊中。　（11月24日于金边）
