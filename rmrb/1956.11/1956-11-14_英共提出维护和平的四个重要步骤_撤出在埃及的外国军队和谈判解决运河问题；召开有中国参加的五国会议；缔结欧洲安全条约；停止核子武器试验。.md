Xinhua News Agency, London, November 13th: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party unanimously adopted a report by the party's General Secretary, John Gollan, on four important steps to maintain peace.

The British "Daily Worker" published an abstract on November 12th of the report adopted by the Executive Committee on the 10th. The four steps proposed in the report are: First, completely withdraw all foreign troops from Egypt and resolve the canal issue through negotiations based on respect for Egypt's sovereignty and national independence. Second, support Switzerland's proposal to convene a five-power conference, and the British Communist Party suggests that China also participate in this conference. Third, this conference must discuss the conclusion of a European security treaty, which would lead to the end of the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from European countries. Fourth, the conference must also reach an agreement to stop all nuclear bomb tests as the first step towards the complete abolition of nuclear weapons and a general agreement on disarmament measures.

The report said: "What happened in Egypt and Hungary are two parts of a joint offensive by capitalist reactionary forces - on the one hand, against the national liberation movement in the colonies, and on the other hand, against socialism."

Regarding the Egyptian issue, the report said that although a ceasefire has been reached, neither peace has been won nor justice has been won for the victims of aggression. Due to the actions of Eden and Mollet, imperialism has gained a strong foothold in the canal area, and Britain and France have established their bases on Egyptian territory by means of conquest. They have strengthened their position under the guise of a ceasefire.

The report pointed out that Eden is playing tricks. He refuses to offer any guarantee to withdraw British troops. The United Nations General Assembly Emergency Session resolution on November 2nd contained a clause: "Requests that steps be taken, upon the cessation of the fighting, to reopen the Suez Canal and restore secure freedom of navigation." Certain imperialist groups are attempting to interpret this as allowing the use of a United Nations police force to force Egypt to accept the eighteen-nation proposal for the control of the Suez Canal. Eden will interpret this to mean that United Nations forces should occupy the canal.

Throughout the period, the United States has been playing a double game. It supported resolutions condemning Britain and France, while taking no effective action to prevent their actions from continuing to develop. The Americans want to intervene in the resolution of the canal issue.

The report exposed the imperialist conspiracy to equate the problems of Egypt and Hungary. It pointed out that in Hungary, the problem developed to the final stage of whether Hungary wanted fascism and counter-revolution or to save socialism.

The report said: If the fascists win in Hungary, it will increase the danger of war. Peace cannot be maintained solely by the power of public opinion, although the power of public opinion is very important. It also requires the socialist countries and socialist forces; the nature of these two forces determines that they will unswervingly strive for peace.

The report pointed out that the Conservative Party and the right wing of the Labour Party are using the Hungarian events to divide the broad mass movement generated on the Egyptian issue, and put forward the four steps mentioned above for every member of the workers' movement to consider.

The report stated that the British Communist Party is conducting a large-scale discussion of the lessons of these recent events. It calls for continued discussions at party member and branch meetings, while also demanding adherence to party discipline and maintaining party unity, and rejecting anything that may weaken and undermine the party's line.

    英共提出维护和平的四个重要步骤
    撤出在埃及的外国军队和谈判解决运河问题；召开有中国参加的五国会议；缔结欧洲安全条约；停止核子武器试验。
    新华社伦敦13日电　英国共产党执行委员会一致通过了党的总书记约翰·高兰关于维护和平的四个重要步骤的报告。
    英国“工人日报”11月12日摘要刊载了执行委员会在10日所通过的报告。报告提出的四个步骤是：第一，完全撤出在埃及的一切外国军队，并且在尊重埃及的主权和民族独立的基础上通过谈判来解决运河问题。第二，支持瑞士关于召开五国会议的建议，英国共产党建议中国也参加这个会议。第三，这个会议必须讨论缔结欧洲安全条约的问题，这个条约将导致华沙条约和北大西洋公约组织条约的结束和从欧洲国家撤退一切外国军队。第四，会议还必须达成协议来停止一切核子炸弹试验，作为完全废除核子武器和大家就裁军措施达成协议的第一个步骤。
    报告说：“在埃及和匈牙利发生的事情是资本主义反动力量的联合攻势中的两个部分——一方面是反对殖民地的民族解放运动，另一方面是反对社会主义。”
    关于埃及问题，报告说，虽然已经停火，但是，既没有赢得和平，也没有为侵略的受害人赢得公正。由于艾登和摩勒的行动，帝国主义已在运河地区得到了坚强的据点，英国和法国已经用征服的办法在埃及领土上建立了它们的基地。它们已在停火的掩饰下加强了它们的地位。
    报告指出，艾登正在玩弄手法。他拒绝提出撤出英国部队的任何保证。联合国大会紧急会议11月2日的决议中有这样一个条款：“要求在停火生效时就要采取步骤来开放苏伊士运河和恢复可靠的通航自由”。某些帝国主义集团企图把这一点解释成为可以使用联合国警察部队强使埃及接受十八国的管制苏伊士运河建议。艾登将会把这一点的意思解释成为联合国部队应占领运河。
    在整个时期内，美国一直玩弄着两面手法。它支持谴责英法的决议，同时又不采取任何有效的行动来阻止它们的行动继续发展下去。美国人想要插手参与运河问题的解决。
    报告揭露帝国主义阴谋把埃及和匈牙利的问题相提并论。它指出：在匈牙利，问题发展到最后阶段已经成为匈牙利是要法西斯主义和反革命还是要拯救社会主义的问题。
    报告说：如果法西斯分子在匈牙利得胜，那就会增加战争的危险。和平不能光靠舆论的力量来维护，虽然舆论的力量是非常重要的。这也需要有社会主义国家和社会主义力量；它们这两种力量由本质决定就是坚持不渝地为和平而努力。
    报告指出保守党和工党右翼正在利用匈牙利事件来分裂在埃及问题上产生的广大群众运动，并且提出了前面谈到的四个步骤供工人运动的每一个成员考虑。
    报告说明英国共产党正在大规模地讨论最近这些事件的教训。它要求在党员和支部会议上继续进行讨论，同时也要求遵守党的纪律和保持党的团结，拒绝一切可能削弱和破坏党的路线。（附图片）
    11月4日下午，伦敦五万群众在特拉法加广场集会，反对政府侵略埃及。会议进行中有人施放烟幕，企图扰乱会场秩序未逞。
