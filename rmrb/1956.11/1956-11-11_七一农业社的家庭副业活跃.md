The Qiyi Agricultural Cooperative in Gushi County, Henan Province, has reversed the phenomenon of excessively strict control over the working hours of its members, and is actively helping and encouraging members to develop household sidelines. The cooperative's more than 2,300 households are engaged in eight types of household sidelines. They raise more than 33,000 chickens, and the number of pigs and ducks raised has also increased by one to two times compared to last year. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Jing) (Attached picture)

    Members Liu Changyou and Liu Wenxiu's family raise eight white geese, each of which now weighs twelve or thirteen catties.

    The thirteen and a half catties of piglets that the cooperative lent to member Da Yuzhen (right) in April have now grown to more than one hundred catties. The cooperative's livestock medical personnel are explaining scientific pig-raising methods to her.

    七一农业社的家庭副业活跃
    河南省固始县七一农业社扭转将社员劳动时间控制得过严的现象，并积极帮助和鼓励社员开展家庭副业，全社二千三百多户共经营八种家庭副业。他们养了三万三千多只鸡，饲养的猪、鸭也比去年增加一倍到二倍。　新华社记者　孙静摄（附图片）
    社员刘长友、刘文秀两家养的八只白鹅，现在每只已有十二、三斤重。
    4月份社里贷给社员笪玉珍（右）的十三斤半的小猪，现已长成一百多斤。社里的牲畜医务人员正在向她讲述养猪的科学方法。
