    Electron Tubes Permeated with the Friendship of the Soviet People
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Ren Zhiqiao Wang Shaoquan
    China's first modern electron tube factory has been completed in Beijing. The rapid construction of this factory, equipped with world-class technology, is inseparable from Soviet assistance. From the selection of the factory site, design, construction, equipment manufacturing, equipment installation, production preparation, production adjustment, to the organization of electron tube trial production, the Beijing Electron Tube Factory is permeated with the fraternal friendship of the Soviet people.
    To help build the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, more than 30 Soviet electron tube factories and machine manufacturing plants supplied China with the latest machinery and equipment, many of which were Soviet products of 1956. The factory has a large "○○○一" punch press, a product of the Soviet Banaul Mechanical Press Factory, which supplied China with the first newly produced punch press. The Svetlanta Factory in Leningrad, in order to manufacture the latest glass tube cutting machine for China, the designers studied and improved on the machines they used in their factory, redesigned and manufactured them, and after the actual operation by the old workers, proved that there were no shortcomings before the machines were shipped to China. In a Soviet electric vacuum equipment manufacturing plant, the semi-automatic exhaust machine used to remove gas from the electron tubes still required manual loading and unloading. After the factory workers accepted the task of manufacturing an exhaust machine for China, they tried every means to replace manual operation with machine operation for the process of unloading electron tubes, making the exhaust machine more automated. When these newly made exhaust machines were sent to China, some Soviet electron tube factories had not yet used this new equipment.
    Old China did not have an electron tube manufacturing industry. Although a foundation had been laid after liberation, there was still a severe shortage of talent. Although the technical personnel and workers needed by the Beijing Electron Tube Factory received support from various sources, most of them were not highly skilled. In this situation, many Soviet experts came to China at the invitation of our government to help our technicians and workers master the new technology of manufacturing electron tubes. Electron tube factories in Moscow and Leningrad sent complete sets of personnel, including chief engineers, workshop directors, section chiefs, and workers. In the factory, to help Chinese workers overcome the difficulties encountered in their work, they often worked day and night. Each Soviet expert was assigned to help train several Chinese technicians and workers. Some Soviet experts did not rest at night and guided unskilled Chinese technicians and workers in their operations. Once, Soviet expert Zhubkova fell ill, and people advised her to rest. She said, "I came to China to help you, not to rest." During the trial run, a Soviet expert found a problem with the grid winding machine, which could not be adjusted properly. He immediately telegraphed the factory in Leningrad that produced the machine, asking them to send someone to find a solution. Less than five days after the telegram was sent, an engineer and a worker arrived in Beijing by plane with spare parts.
    Many technicians and workers at the Beijing Electron Tube Factory have made rapid progress under the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts, and now they are able to master the technology of manufacturing electron tubes. Due to the improvement of the technical level of the workers in one section of the assembly workshop, the output has increased by twelve and a half times compared with the initial trial production. When one type of electron tube was being trial-produced, the factory leaders and Soviet experts, taking into account the workers' technical conditions, originally planned that 130,000 sets of parts would be needed for the trial production to be successful, but only 35,000 sets of parts were used. Dai Hongfang, the head of the Dumet wire section, was originally a novice. After several months of training by Soviet experts, he is now equivalent to a Grade 2 technician. A female frame assembler named Hu Shufang learned the frame assembly technology at the fastest speed. In the past few months, her product yield has reached 100%. The Soviet expert who was responsible for training Hu Shufang said to her when he was about to return to his country, "You have learned very quickly. After I leave, you must teach more new frame assemblers."
    The workers and cadres of the Beijing Electron Tube Factory have established a deep friendship with the Soviet experts in their joint labor, and they are very grateful for the help of the Soviet experts. A poem written by technician Le Kemin expresses the feelings of all the factory's employees towards the Soviet experts:
    Difficulties, you have never been afraid of, bitterness and tiredness, you always do not care about,
    Dear comrades,
    What song can sing out our respect for you!
    Dear teachers,
    Which poem can express our gratitude to you?

    电子管里渗透着苏联人民的友谊
    新华社记者　任志樵　王邵泉
    我国第一座现代化的电子管厂已经在北京建成了。这个以世界上头等技术装备起来的工厂，能够在短短的时间里迅速地建成，是同苏联的援助分不开的。北京电子管厂，从厂址的选择、设计、建筑施工、设备制造、设备安装、生产准备、生产调整，直到组织电子管的生产试制，都渗透着苏联人民兄弟般的友谊。
    为了帮助建设北京电子管厂，苏联的三十多个电子管厂和机器制造厂给我国供应了最新的机器设备，其中有许多是苏联1956年的产品。厂里有一台“○○○一”号的大型冲床，是苏联巴拿乌机械压力机制造厂的产品，他们把刚生产出来的第一台新型冲床供给了我国。列宁格勒的斯维特朗娜工厂，为了给我国制造最新的玻璃管切割机，设计人员根据他们厂里使用的机器，进行研究，改进缺点，重新设计制造，并且经过老工人的实际操作，证明没有任何缺点，才把机器运来中国。在苏联的一个电真空装备制造厂里，排除电子管气体使用的半自动化排气机，装卸制品还是由人工操作。这个厂的职工接受了给中国制造排气机的任务以后，想尽一切办法将卸电子管的工序由机器来代替人工操作，使排气机更加自动化。当这些新制成的排气机送来中国的时候，苏联的一些电子管厂里还没使用这种新设备。
    旧中国没有电子管制造工业，解放以后虽然开始有了一点基础，但是人材仍然非常缺乏。北京电子管厂需要的技术人员和工人，虽然得到了多方面的支援，但是大都技术水平不高。在这种情况下，许多苏联专家应我国政府的邀请，来帮助我国技术人员和工人掌握制造电子管的新技术。莫斯科和列宁格勒等地的电子管厂，都派来了成套的人材，其中有总工程师、车间主任、工段长和工人。他们在工厂里，为了帮助中国工人克服工作中遇到的困难，经常废寝忘食地工作。每个苏联专家都分工帮助培养几个中国技术人员和工人。有的苏联专家，夜间也不休息，指导着技术未熟练的中国技术人员和工人进行操作。有一次，苏联专家茹勃柯娃生病了，人们劝她休息，她说，我到中国来是为了帮助你们的，不是来休息的。还在试车的时候，一位苏联专家发现绕栅机有点毛病，调整不好，立即打电报给列宁格勒生产这台机器的工厂，请他们派人来想办法。这份电报发去还没有五天，一位工程师和一位工人已经带着备用零件，乘飞机赶到北京来了。
    北京电子管厂许多技术人员和工人，在苏联专家热心培养下，都进步很快，现在已经初步能够掌握制造电子管的技术了。装配车间的一个工段由于工人技术水平的提高，产量比初试制时候提高了十二倍半。有一种电子管在试制的时候，工厂领导方面和苏联专家考虑到工人技术条件，原先预定需要投料十三万套零件才能试制成功，结果只用了三万五千套零件。杜美丝工段长戴鸿方原来是个生手，经过苏联专家几个月的培养，现在已经相当于二级技术员的水平了。有一个叫胡舒芳的女装架工，以最快的速度学会了装架技术，几个月来，她生产的成品率都达到了百分之百。负责培养胡舒芳的苏联专家在临回国的时候对她说，你学得很快，我走了以后，你要教会更多的新装架工。
    北京电子管厂的工人、干部同苏联专家在共同劳动中已经建立起了深厚的友谊，他们对苏联专家的帮助都非常感激。在技术员乐克明写的一首诗里表达了全厂职工对苏联专家的心情：
    困难，你们从来也没有害怕，苦和累，你们总是毫不在意，
    亲爱的同志，
    什么歌能唱出我们对你们的尊敬！
    亲爱的老师，
    哪首诗能写尽我们对你们的感激？
