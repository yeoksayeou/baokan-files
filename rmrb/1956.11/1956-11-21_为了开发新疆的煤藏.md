Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 19th: The Urumqi Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau was recently established. It will undertake the tasks of geological exploration and tunneling construction for the future Urumqi coal industry base.

The Ministry of Coal Industry has transferred more than one hundred geological exploration workers and technicians from Northeast China, North China and other places to this Basic Construction Bureau, and has already started topographic surveying work in the Sidaocha coalfield on the outskirts of Urumqi. Another drilling team with two hundred people and ten drilling rigs is on its way to Xinjiang.

Xinjiang has rich coal reserves. In the vicinity of Urumqi, rich coalfields have been discovered, with multiple and thick coal seams, and open-pit mining is possible in many places. Large-scale mining has not been carried out in these coalfields in the past few years. After the establishment of this Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau, the work of developing coal is about to begin.

    为了开发新疆的煤藏
    据新华社乌鲁木齐19日电乌鲁木齐煤矿基本建设局最近成立。它将担负起未来乌鲁木齐煤炭工业基地的地质勘探和井巷建设任务。
    煤炭工业部已经从东北、华北等地为这个基本建设局调来了一百多名地质勘探工人和技术人员，已经在乌鲁木齐市郊的四道岔井田上展开地形测量工作。另有一个拥有二百人和十部钻机的钻探队，正在来新疆的途中。
    新疆煤的藏量丰富。在乌鲁木齐近郊，就发现储量丰富的煤田，煤层既多且厚，许多地方可以露天开采。在这些煤田上，过去几年没有作过大规模的开采。这个煤矿基本建设局成立之后开发煤的工作即将开始。
