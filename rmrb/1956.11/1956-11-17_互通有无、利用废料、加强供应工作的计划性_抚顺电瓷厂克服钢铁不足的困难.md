Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 16th—The Fushun Electric Porcelain Factory has actively overcome the difficulties caused by the shortage of steel materials. Although the steel materials allocated to the factory by the state this year only account for 60% of the planned needs, they have completed their production tasks on a monthly basis from the beginning of the year to the present.

The main methods used by the Fushun Electric Porcelain Factory to solve the problem of insufficient material supply are to strengthen contacts with other factories, find ways to share resources, collect waste materials, and utilize substitute materials. The factory's purchasing personnel have established regular contact with machinery manufacturing plants in Shenyang, Fushun, and other places to mutually adjust temporarily unused steel, pig iron, springs, steel wires, and other materials. They collected waste steel plate edges left over from the manufacture of large machines by the Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant and the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant to process and manufacture the factory's products composed of small parts. From the beginning of the year to the present, the factory has used 34 tons of waste steel plate edges in production. For some materials that could not be resolved, substitute materials were used as much as possible. For example, the isolating switch operating mechanism produced by the factory needed seamless steel pipes with a thickness of 12 mm, which could not be bought domestically, so they used axles produced by the local rubber tire repair factory, drilled holes, and then used them. This not only replaced the seamless steel pipe but also did not affect the quality of the product. Another example is the unequal angle steel used for making switch frames, which was also difficult to obtain this year, so they used equal angle steel from discarded iron towers from the power sector as a substitute.

The factory's production department and supply department also paid great attention to the rational use of materials and the planning of supply work. Since April of this year, the supply department has formulated a detailed material supply plan for the current month and a preparation plan for the next month in accordance with the production plan every month. Production personnel pay close attention to the conservation and rational use of materials. This year, when making small parts such as switch small shafts and screws, they used leftover material heads and did not receive any new materials.

    互通有无、利用废料、加强供应工作的计划性
    抚顺电瓷厂克服钢铁不足的困难
    新华社抚顺16日电　抚顺电瓷厂积极克服钢铁材料不足的困难，今年国家拨给这个厂的钢铁材料虽然只占计划需要量的60％，可是从年初到现在，他们却按月完成了生产任务。
    抚顺电瓷厂解决材料供应不足的主要办法是加强了同别的工厂的联系，他们设法互通有无、收集废料，以及利用代用材料。这个厂的采购人员同沈阳、抚顺等地的机械制造厂建立了经常联系，把暂时不用的钢材、生铁、弹簧、钢丝等材料互相进行调剂。他们收集了抚顺重型机器厂、沈阳矿山机器厂制造大型机器剩下的废钢板边，来加工制造这个厂由小零件组成的产品。从年初到现在，这个厂使用到生产上去的废钢板边就有三十四吨。一些无法解决的材料，也尽量采用了代用材料。例如这个厂生产的隔离开关操动机构，需要用十二公厘厚的无缝钢管，国内买不到，他们就利用当地胶车修理厂生产的车轴，钻上眼以后使用。这样不但代替了无缝钢管，而且并没有影响产品质量。再如做开关架子用的不等边角铁，今年也很难得到，他们就用电业部门废铁塔上的等边角铁来代替使用。
    这个厂的生产部门和供应部门还非常注意材料的合理使用和供应工作的计划性。从今年4月起，供应部门每个月都按照生产计划详细地订出当月的材料供应计划和下月的准备计划。生产人员很注意材料的节约和合理使用。今年在制做开关小轴、螺丝等小零件的时候，使用的都是剩下来的料头，没有领过一点新材料。
