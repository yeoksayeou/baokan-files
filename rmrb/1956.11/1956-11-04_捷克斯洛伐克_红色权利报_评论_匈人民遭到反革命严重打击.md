Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 3rd: The Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee's organ, "Red Right Daily," wrote in an article commenting on the Hungarian situation that the Hungarian counter-revolutionary forces are rapidly advancing and are attempting to plunder the working people of countries within the peaceful camp. Everything proves that fascist bandits—former Horthy officers—are gaining the upper hand. Although the loss of life and economic losses cannot yet be estimated, it is already clear that the Hungarian people are paying a bloody price for not seeing in time the danger threatening them from the fascist counter-revolutionaries. The Hungarian people did not resist the fascist counter-revolutionaries with effective force and united determination, and even often cleared the way for marches and demonstrations, which not only did not help to correct mistakes and eliminate economic difficulties, but resulted in huge material damage. More importantly, they gave the counter-revolutionaries the opportunity to intensify their dangerous attacks on the fundamental foundations of building socialism in Hungary.

The newspaper continued, stating that it is impossible to fully assess the events in Hungary today. However, it must be seen that the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party did not bravely undertake its task at a crucial moment. It was not able to sufficiently mobilize the country's Communist Party members and the working class, and was unable to lead the working people to defeat the conspiracies of the counter-revolutionaries, who received support from abroad and often received instructions from abroad.

According to recent news, many of those who participated in the rebellion in recent days, even holding leading positions, and were misled by erroneous nationalist slogans, now suddenly understand that the allies they chose, or the allies who joined them, are in fact their enemies.

"Red Right Daily" wrote in another article: "The counter-revolution has inflicted the most serious blow on the Hungarian people. It will take a long time to recover from many such blows, and many cannot be recovered from at all. However, the Hungarian people are faced not only with eliminating material losses. The most difficult and decisive struggle awaits them in defending the achievements of the people's democratic system. Regardless of all the conspiracies of the counter-revolution, the decisive struggle for the Hungarian people to build socialism in their own country awaits them."

    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”评论
    匈人民遭到反革命严重打击
    新华社布拉格3日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会机关报“红色权利报”在一篇评论匈牙利局势的文章中写道，匈牙利的反革命力量正在迅速地前进，同时正在想掠夺和平阵营里的国家的劳动人民。每一件事都证明，法西斯匪帮——前霍尔蒂的军官们——正在占优势。虽然至今还无法估计生命的损失和经济上的损失，但是，已经可以清楚地看出，匈牙利人民因为没有及时看到正在威胁他们的来自法西斯反革命分子的危险，正在付出鲜血的代价。匈牙利人民没有用有效的力量、团结决心来抵抗法西斯反革命分子，而甚至常常为游行和示威扫清道路，这些游行和示威不但没有帮助改正错误和消除经济上的困难，结果反而造成巨大的物质上的损害，同时，更重要的是使反革命分子有机会变本加厉地给在匈牙利建设社会主义的根本基础以危险的打击。
    这家报纸继续说，今天不可能充分地估计匈牙利的事件。但是，人们一定看出，匈牙利劳动人民党的领导在有决定意义的时刻并没有勇敢地承担起它的任务，它没有能够足够地动员全国的共产党员和工人阶级，没有能够领导劳动人民来击败从国外得到支持和经常从外国得到指示的反革命分子的阴谋。
    根据最近的消息，那些在最近的日子里参加叛乱，甚至担任领导职位，并且被错误的民族主义口号引入歧途的人有很多现在突然明白，他们所选择的同盟者，或者加入他们的同盟者，实际上是他们的敌人。
    “红色权利报”在另一篇文章中写道：“反革命使匈牙利人民遭受到最严重的打击。要从许多这样的打击下恢复起来将需要一个长时期，而有许多是完全不能恢复的。然而，匈牙利人民所面临的不仅是要消除物质上的损失。在保卫人民民主制度成果方面还有着最困难和决定性的斗争在等着他们。不顾反革命的一切阴谋，实现匈牙利人民建设本国社会主义的决定性的斗争正在等着他们。”
