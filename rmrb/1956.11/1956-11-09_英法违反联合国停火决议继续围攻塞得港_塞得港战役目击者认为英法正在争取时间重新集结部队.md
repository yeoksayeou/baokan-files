Xinhua News Agency, November 8th: Cairo News: British and French troops continued their offensive in the Port Said area after the ceasefire came into effect.

According to the 33rd communique issued by the General Command of the Egyptian Armed Forces at 15:15 on the 7th, British and French troops, disregarding the order to cease fire at 2:00 local time (midnight Greenwich time), were still besieging Port Said. The enemy's attack on the military and civilians of Port Said was continuing at the time of the communique.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi telegraphed UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld about the situation on the 7th. In his telegram, Fawzi said, "The Egyptian government has, in accordance with the resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly and your request, implemented a ceasefire at 2:00 today (November 7th). However, according to the communique issued by the Egyptian Army Headquarters at 15:15, the armed forces of France and Britain are continuing their hostile actions and firing on the military and civilians of Port Said. They have also surrounded the city and cut off its traffic with the rest of the country." Fawzi requested that his telegram be circulated as a UN document.

Also, according to London news: British Prime Minister Eden also admitted in the House of Commons on November 7th that there had been shooting in Port Said throughout the day on the 7th.

Xinhua News Agency, November 8th: An Associated Press reporter's dispatch from Port Said indicated that British and French troops were still attacking Egyptian troops and residents in Port Said after the ceasefire took effect.

Associated Press, Port Said, November 7th: The city has not returned to peace since the ceasefire took effect. Large British tanks stationed at street corners occasionally fired bursts of shells.

The news said that Egyptians continued to resist. Bursts of gunfire resounded in the streets all day long. After the gunfire, a British soldier could be seen being carried away on a stretcher.

Sometimes the stretcher also carried an Egyptian who had been shot down from a window or a rooftop firing position.

Fires were still slowly burning everywhere in the city. The streets were full of rubble and water flowing from burst water pipes. Many buildings have collapsed or are riddled with bullet holes.

The news said that the ceasefire news was warmly welcomed by the British and French landing troops. However, those with guns on the front lines apparently did not know what the agreement was. There was no sign of fulfilling the ceasefire promise in Port Said.

Xinhua News Agency, November 8th: Cairo News: According to a United Press reporter on the 7th, two Egyptian eyewitnesses who returned to Cairo from Port Said said that the British and French troops encountered fierce resistance when they landed in Port Said. The two eyewitnesses believed that it was very possible that the British and French command suggested a ceasefire in order to buy time to regroup their forces.

The two eyewitnesses also talked about the indiscriminate bombing by the British and French air and naval forces. One of the eyewitnesses said that after the troops from the sea encountered unexpected fierce resistance during the landing, the bombing carried out by the British and French air force and navy under orders caused heavy civilian casualties.

One of the eyewitnesses said that bombs including 500-pound bombs hit the city itself, and more bombs were dropped in the suburbs, where there were also many residents.

He estimated that the casualties on both sides were almost average, and most of the casualties were caused by extremely fierce hand-to-hand combat in the city.

United Press also reported that a neutral military observer made an estimate of the Battle of Port Said, saying that his estimate was reasonable and based on the facts already at hand. His estimate is as follows:

1. The British and French greatly underestimated the strength of the Egyptian troops in Port Said, perhaps without realizing how quickly President Nasser had withdrawn his troops from the Sinai Peninsula.

2. They underestimated the spirit of the civilians sharing the same hatred, which became an important factor in the battle.

The neutral military observer said: "Considering the time required for the operations, one can say that the British and French underestimated Egyptian resistance and overestimated their own intelligence. From their own statements and appeals to Egyptian civilians, one can infer that they had many wishful thoughts, believing that the people did not support Nasser, and things proved that this was a big mistake."

The British and French completed the encirclement of the city of Port Said, but in the encirclement there were still many armed civilians and Egyptian troops, hiding behind fortifications and houses to defend themselves.

The Egyptians are ambushing in the trenches in the southern suburbs of Port Said.

Cairo estimates that the total number of British and French troops landed by air and sea is between 24,000 and 30,000.

The "Republic News" said that implementing a ceasefire without withdrawing troops may be a "conspiracy" of the British and French. The newspaper said: "As long as there are invading forces on our territory, we must be vigilant against any political or military conspiracies."

### 英法违反联合国停火决议继续围攻塞得港  塞得港战役目击者认为英法正在争取时间重新集结部队

    英法违反联合国停火决议继续围攻塞得港
    塞得港战役目击者认为英法正在争取时间重新集结部队
    新华社8日讯　开罗消息：英法军队在停火令生效后仍在塞得港地区继续进攻。
    据埃及武装部队总司令部在7日十五时十五分发表的第三十三号公报说：英国和法国的军队不顾在当地时间二时（格林威治时间午夜）停火的命令，仍然在围攻塞得港。敌军对塞得港军民的进攻一直到这份公报发表的时候仍然在继续中。
    埃及外交部长法齐已在7日把这种情况打电报通知联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德。法齐在电报中说，“埃及政府已经根据联合国大会通过的决议和你的要求，在今天（11月7日）两点钟的时候实行停火。但是，根据埃及陆军总部在十五点十五分发表的公报说，法国和英国的武装部队正在继续进行它们的敌对行动，并且向塞得港的军民开火。它们并且已经包围这个城市和切断它和这个国家其他地方的交通。”法齐要求把他的电报作为联合国的文件分发。
    又据伦敦消息：英国首相艾登11月7日在下院讲话时也承认，7日一天塞得港一直都有射击。
    新华社8日讯　美联社记者从塞得港发出的消息表明，在停火令开始生效以后，英法军队仍然在塞得港进攻埃及军队和居民。
    美联社塞得港7日电说，这个城市在停火令生效后还没有恢复和平。停守在街道角落里的大型英国坦克不时地发出一阵阵的炮火。
    消息说，埃及人继续在进行抵抗。街道上整天响着阵阵突发的枪声。枪声过后接着就可以看到一个英国兵被担架抬走。
    有时候担架也抬着一个从窗户或者是屋顶的射击位置上打下来的埃及人。
    烈火仍然在市里各地缓慢地燃烧着。街道上到处都是瓦砾和从爆开的大水管流出来的水。许多建筑物已经倒塌，或者是被炮弹打得弹痕累累。
    消息说，停火消息受到英法登陆部队士兵的热烈欢迎。但是，到底协定怎么样，那些在前线上拿枪的人显然是不知道的。在塞得港没有履行停火诺言的迹象。
    新华社8日讯　开罗消息：据合众社记者7日报道，从塞得港回到开罗的两位埃及目击者说，英法军队在塞得港登陆时遭到猛烈的抵抗。这两位目击者认为，非常可能英法司令部建议停火是为了要争取时间重新集结它们的部队。
    这两位目击者也谈到英法空海军的狂轰滥炸。目击者之一说，在由海上来的部队登陆时遭到了出乎意外的猛烈抵抗之后，英法空军和海军奉令进行的轰炸造成了很大的平民伤亡。
    目击者之一说，包括五百磅重的炸弹击中了城市本身，更多的炸弹投在郊区，在那里也有很多的居民。
    他估计，双方的伤亡差不多是平均的，大多数的伤亡是由于在城市中的极其激烈的肉搏战造成的。
    合众社消息又说，一位中立的军事观察家作了关于塞得港战役的估计，他说，他的估计是有道理的，是以已经在手边的事实为基础的。他的估计如下：
    一、英法对在塞得港的埃及部队的实力大大地估计错了，或许是没有认识到纳赛尔总统如何迅速地把军队从西奈半岛撤回。
    二、他们对平民同仇敌忾的精神估计错了，这在战斗中成为一个重要的因素。
    这位中立的军事观察家说：“考虑到作战行动所需要的时间，人们可以说英法低估了埃及的抵抗和过高地估计了他们自己的情报。从他们自己的声明和对埃及平民发出的呼吁中人们可以推断，他们存在着很多主观愿望的想法，认为人民是不支持纳赛尔的，而事情证实这是大错特错的。”
    英法完成了对塞得港城市的包围，但是在包围中仍然有许多武装的平民和埃及军队，躲在工事和房屋的后面据守。
    埃及人正埋伏在塞得港南郊的战壕里。
    据开罗方面估计，英法由空降和从海上登陆的军队总数为两万四千人到三万人。
    “共和国报”说实行停火而不撤兵可能是英法的一种“阴谋”。这家报纸说：“只要在我们领土上有侵略部队，我们就必须警惕任何政治、军事阴谋。”
