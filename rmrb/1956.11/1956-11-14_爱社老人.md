    Elderly Woman Loves the Cooperative
    Zhou Yulan, a 76-year-old member of the Shengtian Agricultural Cooperative in Xichuan County, Henan Province, is an elderly woman. She not only enthusiastically does some work suitable for her in the cooperative, but also admirably protects the collective property of the cooperative. Therefore, the members all call her "Elderly Woman Loves the Cooperative."
    During this year's summer harvest, the cooperative encountered continuous heavy rain, and the harvested wheat and broad beans were scattered everywhere. When Zhou Yulan saw this, she couldn't bear to see the cooperative suffer such losses. Disregarding the overcast and rainy weather and muddy roads, she took a broom to sweep and used her hands to pick them up. In this way, during one summer harvest, she swept and picked up more than 750 jin of wheat and broad beans, all of which she handed over to the cooperative. After the autumn harvest began, she picked up another sixteen jin of cotton. These two items alone saved the cooperative from losses worth more than fifty yuan.

    爱社老人
    河南淅川县胜天农业社的社员周玉兰，是个七十六岁的老太婆。她不仅热情地做社里的一些适合她做的活，而且出色地爱护着社里的集体财产。因此，社员们都称她为“爱社老人”。
    今年夏收中，这个社碰上了连绵大雨，收回的麦子、蚕豆丢撒的到处都是。周老太太看到后，不忍心让社里受到这样的损失，她不顾天阴下雨、道路泥泞，带着扫帚去扫，用手去拣。就这样，在一个夏收中，她连扫带拣的麦子、蚕豆就有七百五十多斤，全部交给了合作社。秋收开始以后，她又拣到了十六斤棉花。光这两项，她就为社里避免了价值五十多元的损失。
