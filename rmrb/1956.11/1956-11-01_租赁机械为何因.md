    Why Rented Machinery Lies Idle

    In May of this year, the Third Construction Team directly under the Beijing Municipal Construction Bureau spent more than 500 yuan in transportation costs to bring in two imported single-bucket excavators from a rental unit. When they work, they can accomplish the labor of hundreds of people. However, after being used for only ten days or so, they were left idle. One of them was returned to the rental unit in September, and the other is still sitting idle, costing 58 yuan per day in rental fees. Moreover, the machinery is left out in the open, exposed to the sun and rain, and has already started to rust. It is hoped that the Beijing Municipal Construction Bureau will handle this promptly.

    租赁机械为何因
    北京市建筑局直属三工地今年5月份，花了五百多元运费从出租单位运来了两架进口的单斗式挖土机。它们工作起来能顶几百个人的劳动量。可是运来以后，只干了十几天活，就被闲置起来了。其中有一架已于9月退还出租单位，另一架仍闲在那里，每天需要支付五十八元的租赁费。而且，机械露天放着，日晒夜露，风吹雨打，已开始生锈。希望北京市建筑局迅速处理。
