Rambling Through the Book Forest

    On Distributing Books

    Books are meant to be read and used. In the past, libraries like the Tianyi Pavilion of the Fan family in Ningbo, were merely for storing books. Not to mention outsiders, even the descendants of the Fan family were only allowed to see the books once a year during the book-drying season. In the early Qing Dynasty, Qian Qianyi possessed rare books but often kept them "shrouded in mystery," unwilling to let others know about them, let alone lend them out. But now things are very different. Private collectors of large libraries are becoming fewer and fewer. Even if there are some small collectors, even if they have some rare and good books, they cannot hide them; they must lend them to those who need them. Numerous large and small libraries share their resources with each other, and no one has the need or the possibility of "keeping secrets." Books are public property of the world, and no one can possess them privately. The era of "possessing a hundred cities, not even a king can match" in "privately owning things" has long passed. In the studies of experts, there will always be some books, which are things they use themselves, like furniture and teacups. They are used to them and can't always borrow them from others. It is also possible that there are some good books that shine brilliantly, or even books that are only useful to him, the expert who specializes in this field. Except for him and his apprentices, there is no need to introduce them to "colleagues and fellow practitioners," so it doesn't seem necessary to publicize them widely.

    After sorting out the many uncatalogued and unshelved books in the "hidden" large libraries, there will certainly be many duplicates. As far as I know, the Beijing Library has many copies of Yongzheng's "Vermilion Endorsed Edicts," but they are not very useful. The library of the Palace Museum also has many copies of the printed collections of imperial writings of the Qing Dynasty emperors, and I heard that they have all been distributed to various libraries.

    Distributing duplicate books, or books that one does not need or are not suitable, to other libraries is a "meritorious deed." It is an act of making "books" play a greater and more widespread role, and it is a selfless and upright act. The example I mentioned in my article "Visiting Books," where the Guangzhou Library gave the Song edition of Yang Chengzhai's collection to the Beijing Library, is a typical good example.

    There have also been deviations. For example, during the adjustment of Beijing universities and colleges, there were originally plans to distribute books, but because the competition was too fierce, even a music institution wanted to take away all the music books from the Peking University Library, including many copies that had to be separated from the entire set of series. As a result, they parted unhappily, and not a single book was distributed.

    "Distributing" books in such a piecemeal way will certainly cause problems. There should be a comprehensive plan to first sort out the books initially collected from various places according to the needs of the central government and various regions, distinguishing between priorities and urgency, and allocate them in batches. There should absolutely be no localism or the idea of "enriching the small public while forgetting the big public." The duplicate books or books to be distributed in various large libraries should also be compiled into a draft catalogue in advance, waiting for unified distribution, and should not make decisions on their own and distribute them first. That would cause chaos. How many libraries in the country need "Vermilion Endorsed Edicts" or "Imperial Collections of Writings"?

    Many large libraries still have departmentalism. They don't use them themselves, and they don't allow others to use them. For example, the library of a certain industrial school has a very rich and important collection of books on Western literature, but it refuses to allocate them to research institutions or schools that desperately need these books. It is not clear what the "reason" is! This is also a kind of behavior of controlling or hoarding research materials, which is harmful to the progress of our country's scientific research work.

    谈分书
    书是要读、要用的。从前的藏书楼，像宁波范氏天一阁，只是藏书而已。不要说外边的人，即范氏的子孙们也只许每一年在晒书时候和书见面一次。清初，钱谦益藏有奇书，常常“讳莫如深”，不肯给人知道，更不肯借给人看。但现在却大为不同了。私人的大藏书家，已经一天天地少了。即有若干小藏书家，即有些珍罕的好书，也藏不住，总得借给需要它的人使用。许许多多的大大小小的图书馆，更是彼此互通有无，谁也没有“保密”的必要和可能的了。书是天下之公物，谁也不能拥而私之。古语所谓：“坐拥百城，虽南面王不易也”的“私诸个人”的时代，早已过去了。专家们的书房里，多多少少地总会有些书，那是自己使用的东西，像家俱、茶杯似的，用惯了的，总不能老去借用别人的。也可能，在其间有些光彩焕发的好书，甚至仅仅对于他，那个专搞这一行业的专家，十分有用的书。除了他和他的徒弟们，是不必引人人为“同行、同道”的，那末，似乎也不必要大事宣传。
    在把“不见天日”的许多大图书馆里的未编目上架的书整理出来之后，一定会有许多复本。据我所知，北京图书馆就有不少部雍正的“朱批谕旨”，不过没有多大用处而已。故宫博物院图书馆里也有不少部铅印的清代各帝御制文集，听说，也都分配到各个图书馆去了。
  把复本书，把自己所不需要的或不合用的书，分配给了别的图书馆，那是“功德无量”的事，那是使“书”发挥了更大的更广泛的作用的事，那是毫无私心的光明磊落的事。我在谈访书一文里所说的广州图书馆把宋版杨诚斋集送给了北京图书馆的事，就是典型的一个好例子。
    也有出了偏差的，像北京院校调整的时候，原来也预备分书的，因为争夺得太厉害，甚至有一个音乐机构，要把北京大学图书馆里所有的音乐书籍，包括许多要从整套丛书里拆散出来的本子在内，全都提了走。结果是不欢而散，一部书也没有分成。
    像那样枝枝节节地“分”书，当然会发生问题。应该有一个通盘的计划，先把各地集中的初步整理好的书籍，根据中央及各地的需要，分别先后缓急，一批批地调拨出去。绝对地不应该有地方观念或“肥小公而忘记大公”的思想。各个大图书馆的复本书或待分配的书，也应该先行编个草目，以待统一分配，不宜自作主张，先行分配出去。那是会造成混乱现象的。全国有多少个图书馆需要“朱批谕旨”或“御制文集”的呢？
    有不少大图书馆还存在着本位主义。自己不用，也不许别人用。像一个工业学校图书馆，收藏着十分丰富而重要的关于西洋文学的图书，就是不肯调拨出去，给十分需要这些书籍的研究机构或学校使用。不明白其“道理”何在！这也是属于把持或压积研究资料的一类行为，对于我国科学研究工作的进行是有害的。　（本节未完，待续）
