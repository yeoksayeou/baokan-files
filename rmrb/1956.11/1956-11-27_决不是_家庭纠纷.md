In Yongfeng Township, Jiangyou County, Sichuan Province, after some agricultural cooperatives transitioned to advanced cooperatives at the beginning of this year, many young members, seeing the implementation of remuneration based on labor and the care provided to "Five Guarantee Households," clamored to separate from their elderly parents or deliberately made things difficult for them, wanting them to enjoy "Five Guarantees" treatment in the agricultural cooperatives, attempting to reduce their burdens and troubles. After discovering these problems, the Party and Youth League organizations in the township convened meetings separately, criticized Party members and Youth League members with poor performance, and carried out education on safeguarding collective interests and communist morality. At the same time, through the agricultural cooperative members' congress, they explained the government's promulgated laws and clarified what kind of cooperative members could be considered for "Five Guarantees" care. Through these methods, the thinking of many young people was transformed. Ten Youth League members who originally did not want to support their parents and clamored for separation gradually changed their minds. Now, young people consider it a matter of course to care for their parents.

After agricultural cooperativization, individual interests and collective interests are basically unified. However, under the condition of basic consistency, the contradictions between the two are still manifested in various specific ways in many concrete issues. One of the important tasks of rural Party and Youth League organizations is to constantly pay attention to the specific manifestations of these contradictions in the course of development, and to work in response to these contradictions, so that individual interests that harm collective interests are subordinate to collective interests.

The kind of thinking that emerged among young people in Yongfeng Township after advanced cooperativization is a concrete manifestation of the contradiction between farmers' individual interests and collective interests. If this contradiction is not resolved, selfish and self-interested personal plans will harm the collective interests of the cooperative, and also harm the morality of the new society of supporting and respecting the elderly. Precisely because the Party and Youth League organizations in Yongfeng Township were able to recognize this principle, they did not, like some local Party and Youth League organizations, turn a blind eye to this as a "family dispute," but instead grasped it as an important political and ideological task, which promptly overcame the farmers' selfish and self-interested plans on this issue, overcame the contradiction between individual interests and collective interests, and also conducted a vivid education on communist morality for young people, thereby transforming the social atmosphere.

The practice of Yongfeng Township is worthy of learning by Party and Youth League organizations in various regions.

    决不是“家庭纠纷”
    四川省江油县永丰乡有些农业合作社在今年年初转为高级社以后，不少青年社员看到实行按劳取酬和照顾“五保户”的办法，便闹着要和自己年老的父母分家，或故意刁难自己年老的父母，要他们到农业社里去享受“五保”待遇，企图借此减轻负担和减少麻烦。该乡党、团组织发现这些问题以后，就分别召开了会议，批评了表现不好的党员和团员，并开展了维护集体利益和共产主义道德的教育。同时通过农业社社员大会，向农民解释了政府公布的法令和说明那类社员才能当作五保户照顾。通过这些办法，使得许多青年的思想有了转变。有十个原来不愿供养父母闹着分家的团员，都逐渐转变过来了。现在，青年们把关心父母看做是理所当然的事。
    农业合作化以后，个人利益和集体利益基本上统一起来了，但是，在基本一致的条件下，两者的矛盾在很多具体问题上还表现出各种各样的具体矛盾。农村党、团组织的重要任务之一就是要在事物发展过程中，不断注意这些矛盾的具体表现，针对这种矛盾去进行工作，使损害集体利益的个人利益服从集体利益。
    永丰乡高级合作化以后，在青年中出现的那种思想，正是农民个人利益和集体利益发生矛盾的具体表现，如果不解决这个矛盾，自私自利的个人打算就会损害合作社的集体利益，而且也损害了奉养和尊敬老人的新社会的道德。正因为永丰乡党、团组织能够认识这个道理，他们没有像有些地方党、团组织一样，把这当成“家庭纠纷”熟视无睹，而是当作一项重要的政治、思想工作来抓紧进行，这就及时地克服了农民在这个问题上的自私自利的打算，克服了个人利益和集体利益的矛盾，也对青年进行了一次生动的共产主义道德的教育，并因而转变了社会风气。
    永丰乡的做法是值得各地党、团组织学习的。
