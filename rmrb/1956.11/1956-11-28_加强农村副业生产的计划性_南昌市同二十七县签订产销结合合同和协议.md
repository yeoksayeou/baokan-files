    Strengthening the Planning of Rural Sideline Production
    Nanchang City Signs Production-Sale Combination Contracts and Agreements with Twenty-Seven Counties
    (Reported by this newspaper) Nanchang City and Nanchang Special District jointly convened a conference on urban-rural production and sales relations. Participants included personnel from various commercial departments, as well as responsible personnel from the sideline production offices of various counties and cities. At the meeting, Nanchang City signed urban-rural production-sale combination contracts and agreements with twenty-seven counties, including Nanchang and Poyang, with a transaction value of more than 6.5 million yuan.
    Through the signing of contracts and agreements, the representatives of various counties (cities) participating in the meeting corrected the blindness in rural sideline production and strengthened the planning of production. Originally, some counties blindly produced sweet potato flour and bricks and tiles, resulting in large quantities of stockpiles. After consultation and balancing, they stopped the production of sweet potato flour and appropriately controlled the production of bricks and tiles. For some products, such as the potential for local paper production in Tonggu County was very large, but in the past, it was impossible to figure out the sales, and they did not dare to boldly develop it. After this meeting, the production plan for next year was expanded.
    At the meeting, representatives of various counties, through signing contracts and balancing plans, discovered the production potential of products such as furry chickens, salted fish, eggs, local paper, ginger, palm shreds, and garlic bulbs, and revised their production plans for next year. For example, Wanzai County originally planned to produce 300,000 dan of charcoal next year, but now it has been changed to 1.5 million dan; the original plan was to plant 3,000 mu of ramie next year, but now it has been changed to 12,000 mu. Poyang County originally planned to produce 600,000 chickens next year, but now it has been changed to 800,000, and the purchase plan has also increased from 300,000 to 400,000. Xinyu County also decided to increase the production of 23 new products next year, such as fir bark, bamboo branches, and bamboo yellow.
    Through this production-sale meeting, some varieties of socks, towels, clothing, and cultural supplies needed by the rural areas of Nanchang, Xinjian, Fengcheng, Fengxin, and Anyi counties basically met the requirements of various counties. Nanchang City also considered using methods such as processing shredded radish, dried radish, and brewing wine to help various counties solve the problem of product sales for products such as radishes and acorns that were overproduced in various counties.
    In this signing of contracts and agreements, the method of direct face-to-face trading between production and sales was promoted, which exposed some phenomena of multiple operating links and unreasonable prices in the past, and promoted the improvement of business management by state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives. Some commercial relationships that had been interrupted in the past have also been restored.

    加强农村副业生产的计划性
    南昌市同二十七县签订产销结合合同和协议
    本报讯　南昌市和南昌专区联合召开了城乡产销关系会议。参加会议的有各个商业部门的人员、各县、市副业生产办公室的负责人员等。在会议上，南昌市同南昌、鄱阳等二十七县签订了城乡产销结合合同和协议，成交价值达六百五十多万元。
    参加会议的各县（市）代表，通过签订合同和协议，纠正了农村副业生产中的盲目性，加强了生产的计划性。原来有些县盲目生产山粉、砖瓦，结果大量积压。经过协商平衡以后，就停止了山粉的生产，适当控制了砖瓦的生产。有些产品，如铜鼓县土纸生产潜力很大，过去没有摸清销路，不敢大胆发展，开了这次会议以后，就把明年生产计划扩大了。
    各县代表在会议上通过签订合同、平衡计划，发掘了毛鸡、咸鱼、蛋品、土纸、生姜、棕片、大蒜子等产品的生产潜力，修订了明年的生产计划。如万载县原计划明年生产木炭三十万担，现改为一百五十万担；苎麻原计划明年种三千亩，现改为一万二千亩。鄱阳县原计划明年产鸡六十万只，现改为八十万只，收购计划也由三十万只增为四十万只。新喻县也决定明年增加生产杉树皮、竹枝、竹黄等二十三种新产品。
    通过这次产销会议，南昌、新建、丰城、奉新、安义等县农村需要的袜子、毛巾、服装、文化用品等，有些品种基本上满足了各县的要求。各县生产过剩的萝卜、栎子等产品，南昌市也想到了用加工萝卜丝、萝卜干和酿酒等办法，帮助各县解决产品销路问题。
    在这次签订合同和协议中，推行了产销直接见面交易方法，暴露了一些过去经营环节多、价格不合理的现象，促进了国营商业和供销合作社改善经营管理。有些过去中断了的商业关系也恢复了。
