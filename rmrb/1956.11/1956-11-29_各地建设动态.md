Local Construction Dynamics

Promoting Winter Construction Experience

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 27th: Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation has summarized twenty-six advanced experiences in winter construction and is vigorously promoting them.

Based on past experiences in winter concrete construction, where the faster electric heating method or steam heating method was mostly used, the company decided to adopt the heat storage method for over 70% of concrete projects this year due to a twofold increase in workload compared to last year and a severe shortage of electricity and steam boilers. This method can accelerate the construction progress without requiring electricity or boilers. Simple covering with sawdust or straw bags is sufficient for insulation. Recently, due to a shortage of sawdust, some construction sites have used rice husks as a substitute, with still good results.

To ensure that earthwork projects can continue to be carried out mechanically in winter, relevant departments have adopted the soil loosening and insulation method—covering the soil extraction site with insulation materials or loosening the ground to prevent freezing. In the past, roof waterproofing projects were difficult to carry out in winter. This year, cold mastic was prepared based on advanced Soviet experience, allowing roof waterproofing projects to be carried out even at temperatures as low as minus twenty degrees Celsius.

Mechanized Cement Plant

Xinhua News Agency: A cement plant is under construction in Yao County, Shaanxi Province. Once completed, it will produce 680,000 tons of high-grade quality cement annually, specifically for use in Shaanxi Province's large-scale industrial construction.

This cement plant is expected to go into production by the end of 1958, and its entire production process will be mechanized. Cement raw materials extracted five miles from the plant area will be loaded onto trackless electric vehicles and transported directly to the plant's raw material workshop. All production workshops and transportation pipelines have sealed devices to prevent lime powder from flying and affecting workers' health. This cement plant was designed by the Shenyang Cement Plant Design Institute, commissioned by the Ministry of Building Materials Industry.

Textile Mill in the Qin Chuan Plain

Xinhua News Agency: The third factory of the first group of cotton textile printing and dyeing joint enterprises in the Qin Chuan Plain, Shaanxi Province—the state-owned Northwest Fifth Cotton Textile Mill, has begun trial production.

This factory is located in Baqiao District, eastern suburb of Xi'an City, and has 100,000 spindles and 3,000 looms. In early November this year, it began trial weaving with the fine yarn spun by the factory itself. Now, newly produced cotton from the local area is being continuously sent to the factory's warehouse, waiting for the entire factory's trial production to be completed before being officially handed over to the state to start spinning and weaving. At that time, it will produce a large number of line serge, jean cloth, and fine cloth of high-count yarn.

To Save Copper

Xinhua News Agency: Shanghai Second Bureau of Heavy Industry is expanding a processing plant that can save a large amount of copper—the joint state-private San Ying Electrical Industry Factory.

This factory successfully tested the "electrodeposition" method of adding a layer of purple copper to the surface of iron rollers this spring. Since then, paper mills and paper machine manufacturers in Shanghai and Northeast China have used iron instead of copper to manufacture paper machine rollers, asking the San Ying Electrical Industry Factory to add a layer of electrodeposited copper, or bringing worn-out rollers to add a layer of electrodeposited copper.

In the past, experiments were conducted to clad copper or cast copper on the outside of iron paper machine rollers, but the quality was not as good as using electrodeposition. This factory is now using the same method to successfully test adding copper to printing rollers of printing and dyeing machines, to replace imported printed copper rollers.

This workshop is being expanded. After completion, it will be able to process three thousand rollers for paper machines or printing and dyeing machines each year.

Expanding Twenty-Nine Workshops

Xinhua News Agency: Shanghai Second Bureau of Heavy Industry has invested in expanding workshops for twenty-nine joint state-private factories manufacturing new products this year.

These workshops, which have been invested in for expansion, will manufacture organic glass, metal spraying guns, high-grade welding rods, high-altitude meteorological instruments, new pesticide "1605," Haichang Blue dye, and sunflower seed hull sound insulation boards, and other fifty-three new products with important uses. These new products were trial-produced by this group of factories before and after the implementation of joint state-private ownership.

The Ruifa Metal Spraying and Welding Machine Factory, which has completed expansion, has increased the monthly output of metal spraying guns from one to thirty. The Bincheng Welding Material Manufacturing Factory, which successfully trial-produced high-grade welding rods, will expand a workshop and add machine tools and other equipment, increasing the output of high-grade welding rods by more than one time.

Ancillary Factory Buildings

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 27th: The auxiliary factory buildings of the Chengdu Cutting Tool Factory—the tool workshop and the repair workshop—have begun installing machines. Among them, the tool workshop is for producing fixtures and tools for the factory itself; according to regulations, this workshop should be put into production before the workshops of the cutting tool and measuring tool factory begin production, to ensure the needs of other workshops. After this workshop is put into production, according to the equipment capacity calculation, it can produce 500,000 sets of fixtures and tools annually.

Laying Rails Seven Kilometers a Day

Xinhua News Agency: At 5:40 p.m. on the 25th, the railway laying troops of the Railway Corps on the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway laid the rails to Guokeng Station, which is only fifty-nine kilometers away from Xiamen. From here, there will be a railway branch line leading to Zhangzhou City, a major town in southern Fujian.

When the rails were laid to Guokeng, representatives from all walks of life in Longxi Prefecture, which is rich in fruits, rice, timber, and fish and salt, welcomed the rail-laying troops; members of agricultural production cooperatives along the railway, which produce fruits, selected the largest oranges, bananas, and sugar cane, etc., to give to the Railway Corps officers and soldiers and civilian workers to eat.

Now, the rail-laying troops and the road-building troops pre-laying sleepers are advancing towards Xiamen, the terminus of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, at a speed of more than seven kilometers per day.

Surveying Hydropower Resources

This newspaper reports: Guangxi Province is actively conducting hydropower surveying and general survey work. As of November 17th, it has sent five teams, including geological teams and drilling teams, to conduct hydropower surveying on the Gui River as a priority, and three general survey teams to carry out hydropower general survey work on the Liu River, Long River, Qian River, and Luoqing River in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture.

The Gui River, Liu River, Hongshui River, Zuojiang River, and Youjiang River in the Pearl River system have rapid water flows and large natural drops; in addition, they are located in the subtropical zone, with abundant rainfall all year round and large river flows, so hydropower resources are abundant. According to preliminary estimates, the exploitable hydropower reserves in the province are at least over ten million kilowatts. The hydropower generating capacity of the Dateng Gorge in Guiping County and the Fenghuang Reservoir in Xincheng County, where large-scale dams can be built, will be one-and-a-half to two times larger than that of the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station on the Yellow River. The hydropower capacity of the Songlin Gorge and Wangcun on the Gui River, which are now listed as key survey areas, is also second only to the Xiaofengman Hydropower Station. (Chen Gengxin)

    各地建设动态
    推广冬季施工经验
    据新华社鞍山27日电　鞍山冶金建筑总公司总结出二十六项冬季施工的先进经验，正在大力推广。
    这个公司根据过去在冬季混凝土工程施工中，大部分是采用进度较快的电热法或蒸汽加热法；今年因为工程量比去年增大了两倍，电力和蒸汽锅炉十分缺乏，因此决定在70％以上的混凝土工程上采用蓄热法。这个方法能加快工程进度，不需要电力和锅炉，只要用锯末或草袋盖一盖，就可以保温。最近因为锯末缺乏，部分工地又用谷糠代替，效果仍然很好。
    为了使土方工程在冬季也能照常用机械化施工，有关部门已经采用了松土保温法——把采土场用保温材料盖住，或者把地面搞松，以免冻结。过去冬天屋盖上的防水层工程很难做，今年根据苏联先进经验配制了冷玛?脂，屋盖防水工程在零下二十度的气温下也可以进行。
    机械化的水泥厂
    据新华社讯　在陕西耀县境内正在兴建一座水泥厂。建成以后，它每年可以生产六十八万吨高标号的优质水泥，专门供应陕西省大工业建设使用。
    这座水泥厂预计在1958年底投入生产，它的整个生产过程都将采用机械操作。由厂区五里外开采下来的水泥原料，用挖掘机装上无轨电车，一直送到厂里的原料车间。全部生产车间和运输管道都有密闭装置，以免石灰粉末飞扬，影响工人健康。这座水泥厂是由建筑材料工业部委托沈阳水泥厂设计院设计的。
    秦川平原的纺织厂
    据新华社讯　陕西秦川平原第一组棉纺织印染联合企业的第三座工厂——国营西北第五棉纺织厂，开始试车生产。
    这座工厂建设在西安市东郊灞桥区，它拥有十万枚纱锭和三千分台布机。今年11月上旬就开始用本厂纺出的细纱试行织布。现在，当地出产的新棉正源源送进工厂的仓库，只等全厂试车生产完成以后，就要移交国家正式开工纺纱织布了。那时它将大量织造线哔叽、直贡呢和高支纱的细布。
    为了节省铜
    据新华社讯　上海市第二重工业局正在扩建一个可以大量节约铜的加工厂——公私合营三英电业厂。
    这个工厂在今年春天试验成功在铁制滚筒表面加一层紫铜的“电积”方法。以后，上海和东北等地的造纸厂和造纸机制造厂就用铁代替铜制造造纸机滚筒，请三英电业厂加一层电积铜，或者把用坏了的滚筒拿来加一层电积铜。
    在铁制的造纸机滚筒外面镶铜、铸铜，过去曾经研究试用，但是质量没有用电积的好。这个厂现在又用同样的办法，试验成功在印染机印花滚筒上加铜，以代替进口的印花铜滚筒。
    这个车间正进行扩建，完工后，每年能够加工三千多根造纸机或印染机用的滚筒。
    扩建二十九个车间
    据新华社讯　上海市第二重工业局今年为二十九个制造新产品的公私合营工厂投资扩建车间。
    投资扩建的这些车间，将制造有机玻璃，金属喷涂枪、高级电焊条、高空测候仪、新农药“一六零五”、海昌蓝染料和葵花子壳隔音板等五十三种有重要用途的新产品。这些新产品都是这批工厂在实行公私合营前后试制成功的。
    已经扩建完成的瑞法喷金属电焊机器厂，金属喷涂枪的月产量从一支增加到三十支。试制成功高级电焊条的斌诚电焊材料制造厂，扩建一个车间和增添机床等设备，高级电焊条的产量将增加一倍以上。
    一辅助厂房
    新华社成都27日电　成都刃具厂的辅助厂房——工具车间和修配车间，已经开始安装机器。其中的工具车间是为本厂生产卡具和工具的；按照规定，这个车间应该在刃具及量具两厂房各车间开始生产以前投入生产，以保证其他车间的需要。这个车间投入生产以后，按照设备能力计算，每年能生产五十万台的卡具和工具。
    每天铺轨七公里
    据新华社讯　25日下午五点四十分，铁道兵鹰厦铁路铺轨部队把钢轨铺到了距离厦门只有五十九公里的郭坑车站。从这里，将有一条铁路支线通往闽南主要城镇漳州市。
    当钢轨铺到了郭坑的时候，来自盛产水果、稻谷、木材和鱼盐的龙溪专区的各界人民代表们，夹道欢迎铺轨部队；铁路沿线出产水果的农业生产合作社社员们，挑选出最大的柑桔、香蕉和甘蔗等送给铁道兵官兵和民工们吃。
    现在，铺轨部队和预铺枕木的筑路部队正以每天七公里多的速度向鹰厦铁路的终点厦门挺进。
    勘测水力资源
    本报讯　广西省积极进行水力发电的勘测和普查工作。到11月17日止，已经派出地质队、钻探队等五个队在桂江重点进行水力发电的勘测，有三个普查队在桂西僮族自治州的柳江、龙江、黔江和洛清江等河流开展水力发电的普查工作。
    珠江水系的桂江、柳江、红水河、左江、右江等河流，水流湍急，天然落差大；加之地处亚热带，常年雨量充沛，河水流量大，所以水力资源丰富。据初步估计，全省可资利用的水力发电蕴藏量最少在一千万瓩以上。可以建设大型水坝的桂平县大藤峡和忻城县凤凰水库蕴藏的水力发电量都将比黄河三门峡水力发电站大半倍到一倍。现在被列为勘测重点的桂江松林峡和旺村两处，其水力发电能力也仅次于小丰满水力发电站。　（陈庚辛）
