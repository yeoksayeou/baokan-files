Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, November 10th: According to TASS, some political figures in West Germany are demanding that the so-called "Radio Free Europe," established by the United States in Munich, cease broadcasting provocative statements targeting the Hungarian events. They emphasize that the activities of this radio station within West German territory damage the national dignity of the German people and seriously undermine the sovereignty of their country.

    Filler, chairman of the All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights parliamentary group, pointed out at a meeting of the West German Federal Assembly that it is intolerable for the United States to conduct propaganda against West Germany's Eastern neighbors from within West German territory.
