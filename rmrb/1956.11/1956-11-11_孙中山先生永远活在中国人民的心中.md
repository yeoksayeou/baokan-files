Mr. Sun Yat-sen was born on November 12, 1866, and it has been a full ninety years since then. Mr. Sun Yat-sen dedicated his life to "seeking freedom and equality for China." The liberated Chinese people will always commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the revolutionary pioneer who paved the way for our victory, with lofty respect.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen had the ambition to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish a republic from the defeat of the Sino-French War in 1885. Around the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, he began his revolutionary activities, organizing the Xingzhonghui in Honolulu and Hong Kong, and launching the first armed uprising in Guangzhou. In 1905, he prepared to organize the Tongmenghui in Tokyo, Japan. At that time, I was studying at the Dasei Middle School in Tokyo. One Sunday in early July of that year, classmates studying at the Iwakura Railway School talked about how Cheng Jiachen had written in large letters on the blackboard of the school, "Mr. Sun Yat-sen has arrived in Tokyo." My comrade Dan Maoxin and I went to Cheng Jiachen to inquire about Mr. Sun's residence. After arriving at Cheng Jiachen's residence, he asked about our intentions and immediately invited Mr. Sun out, as Mr. Sun was living in his house at the time. Mr. Sun was very happy to talk with young people with revolutionary aspirations. Upon meeting, without any customary greetings, his first words were, "It is very good that you young people have the ambition to make revolution to save the country." Then he asked what we were studying in Japan. We replied that we were currently at Dasei Middle School and planned to enter military school after the summer vacation. He said, "The great powers want to carve up China, and the Qing government is not seeking to revitalize the country. We patriotic people must take timely action and prepare to launch attacks at any time. If we must wait until we have completed our studies, returned to China, and have troops under our command, I am afraid it will be too late! Revolutionary party members only need to learn how to shoot guns and cannons. The strategies and tactics adopted by the revolutionary army are very different from those of the regular army. Only by taking risks and not fearing sacrifice can we hope for success." When Mr. Sun said these words, his tone was earnest and his demeanor was graceful. At that time, we had also read some revolutionary books and newspapers, had preliminary revolutionary ideas, and accumulated a full of enthusiasm to shed for the independence and freedom of the motherland. Hearing Mr. Sun's words moved us greatly, and without further thought, we expressed our willingness to join the revolutionary organization, wrote the Tongmenghui oath, and presented it to Mr. Sun in person. Mr. Sun shook hands with us, following the custom of the society. This was the beginning of our meeting with Mr. Sun and the beginning of our revolutionary activities under Mr. Sun's leadership.

At that time, there were two completely different lines on the China issue: one was the line of the reformists, who advocated not fundamentally changing the feudal system, but simply establishing a constitutional monarchy to develop domestic capitalism; the other was the line of the revolutionaries, who advocated overthrowing the feudal monarchy, establishing a democratic republic, and achieving the goal of saving the country and the people. History has proven that the former was not feasible, and once the broad masses of people had awakened, it became an obstacle on the revolutionary road. Mr. Sun Yat-sen at that time took a clear revolutionary stance and resolutely opposed the reformist stance.

I remember that around the end of July 1905, Chinese students studying in Japan held a grand meeting at the Fujimiken Building in Tokyo to welcome Mr. Sun, and Mr. Sun delivered a speech at the meeting. After recounting the facts of the Qing government's cruel national oppression, he continued, "Some people think that, historically speaking, China's reform is suitable for a constitutional monarchy. This view is very wrong. You are all students studying in Japan and know that Japan's railways are narrow-gauge, while Europe and America's railways are wide-gauge. Does this mean that when China builds railways in the future, it must first build narrow-gauge and then change to wide-gauge! Why did the students come to Japan to study? Is it to make China rich, strong, independent, and autonomous? If so, then the students must think carefully. Now the Qing government is losing sovereignty and humiliating the country, and the powers, seeing through the incompetence of the Qing government, are vying with each other to use our motherland's beautiful rivers and mountains as their hunting ground. Recently, the talk of carving up China has become rampant. I ask, can those powers who want to invade China allow China to leisurely reform? Please give this a serious consideration and take practical and effective measures to save China from peril! If we cannot catch up quickly, overthrow the corrupt and incompetent Qing government, and establish an independent and free republic, then the tragic disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction will be imminent." Mr. Sun's words were impassioned and his demeanor was majestic. The whole audience was silent, and some were moved to tears.

At that time, many people participated in the revolution out of a simple desire to expel the Manchus. As for what kind of country to build after overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, their thinking was still unclear. Mr. Sun Yat-sen not only put forward the idea of establishing a democratic republic, but also paid attention to how to avoid the malpractices of the European and American capitalist systems. At the same meeting, he said: When we establish a republic, we must also prevent the dictatorship of capitalists. Now the republican regimes in the world are controlled by capitalists, and ordinary poor people cannot receive equal treatment, so there are already advocates of socialism. When our country is founded, we must first pay attention to civil rights and use the latest political construction. Under such historical conditions, he could have this view, which shows his far-sightedness and outstanding insight. Mr. Sun's remarks and insights gave us, who followed him, extremely great enlightenment and influence.

At the end of the same year, Mr. Sun Yat-sen introduced me, along with Huang Fusheng and Zeng Guan, to Yokohama to learn how to make bombs from Comrade Liang Muguang. Mr. Sun also lived in Yokohama, so there were more opportunities to be close to him. When he met with us, he often paid attention to understanding the specific situation in various parts of the country and studying how to expand the revolutionary influence under the then environment. At that time, he had many contacts overseas, and the revolutionary activities had a certain foundation. He wanted us to recruit more people with lofty ideals to participate in the revolution in the country, especially to work among the army, schools, and intellectuals, and to expand the revolutionary influence and strengthen the revolutionary actions from these aspects. The reason why he introduced me to learn bomb-making was also to prepare conditions for practical revolutionary action after returning to China. Subsequently, I went back to China with the mission to carry out revolutionary activities.

After the establishment of the Tongmenghui, it organized many armed uprisings in the country, such as the Chaozhou, Huanggang, and Huizhou uprisings, the Battle of Zhennanguan, and the Guangzhou New Army Uprising. Among them, the largest and most influential was the Guangzhou Uprising on March 29, 1911. This uprising gathered a large amount of manpower and financial resources from comrades at home and abroad, and made a fierce impact on the reactionary rule of the Qing Dynasty. Many outstanding comrades of the Tongmenghui sacrificed themselves in this uprising. The heroic death was, as Mr. Sun said, truly able to "shock the heavens and make the ghosts weep." I personally participated in this uprising, and my comrades-in-arms who fought with me in the revolutionary struggle, Fang Shengdong, Lin Shishuang, Yu Peilun, Qin Bing, etc., all heroically died in this uprising. Due to this failure, Mr. Sun was afraid that comrades would develop pessimistic and disappointed emotions, so he encouraged everyone to cultivate strength, prepare conditions, and continue the revolutionary cause with renewed efforts. Therefore, everyone was even more invigorated and finally achieved the success of the Xinhai Revolution.

After the founding of the Republic of China, Mr. Sun took office as the Provisional President. Soon after, the fruits of the victory of the Xinhai Revolution were usurped by the Beiyang warlords headed by Yuan Shikai. In 1913, Yuan Shikai assassinated Song Jiaoren, removed the military governorships held by Kuomintang members in several southern provinces, and borrowed huge sums of money from five imperialist countries. Mr. Sun raised troops to fight against Yuan, and I participated in this struggle. After the failure of the anti-Yuan campaign, Mr. Sun fled to Japan, and I also went to Tokyo. This was when Mr. Sun, in view of the past organizational looseness and lack of unified will, decided to organize the Chinese Revolutionary Party. I met Mr. Sun and joined the Chinese Revolutionary Party. In 1915, Yuan Shikai stole the country and proclaimed himself emperor. Mr. Sun again raised troops to fight against Yuan, and I also participated in the anti-Yuan military action.

After Yuan Shikai died, other warlord factions rose up, and Zhang Xun, Cao Kun, Wu Peifu, etc. successively seized the Beijing regime. At this time, China was in the darkness of "a long night, when will dawn come?" Mr. Sun Yat-sen carried out one struggle after another, and also experienced one failure after another, and was distressed because he could not find a way to achieve victory in the revolution, but he did not put down the banner of struggle. He finally met the October Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party in despair and began the greatest transformation of his life. Mr. Sun accepted the help of the international working class and the Chinese working class, bravely adopted the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers; and on the basis of these three major policies, convened the First National Congress of the Kuomintang and reorganized the Chinese Kuomintang that he founded. At that time, I was in the army and was nominated by Mr. Sun and elected as a member of the Central Committee. This was the first time I held a party position, and I felt very honored. Mr. Sun sent comrades to convey the major decision to implement the three major policies, and I realized that establishing friendly relations with the Soviet Union, forming a close revolutionary alliance with the Chinese Communist Party, and listing the opposition to imperialism as the primary revolutionary task were of inestimable significance to the development of the Chinese revolution.

When Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary forces were developing vigorously with the help of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, the reactionary forces of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu were also gradually expanding. Mr. Sun hoped that we would rectify the troops, stabilize the local areas, and prepare to respond to the Northern Expedition and overthrow the warlords. At that time, Cao Kun bribed his way to the presidency, and Mr. Sun sent troops to punish the traitors and personally issued an order appointing me as the Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan Army of the Punitive Expeditionary Force. With Mr. Sun's strong leadership, I fought many battles with the armies of the Zhili, Lu, Yu, Chuan, Qian, and E provinces of the Beiyang warlord system mobilized by Wu Peifu. Later, I moved my troops to western Hunan, which was when Mr. Sun set out from Shanghai to the north. In his "Northern Expedition Declaration," he announced that the purpose of this northern expedition was "not only to destroy Cao Wu, but also to ensure that after Cao Wu is destroyed, no one will succeed in the same way; ... not only to overthrow the warlords, but also to overthrow the imperialism on which the warlords depend for their survival." He demanded that "the phenomenon of force combined with imperialism be permanently eliminated from the country." He accepted the proposal of the Chinese Communist Party, calling for a National Conference attended by people from all walks of life, groups, all armies opposing Cao Wu, and political parties to jointly solve domestic problems and abolish unequal treaties. His views were clear and sharply opposed to Zhang Zuolin and Duan Qirui. When he received newspaper reporters in Shanghai, he said: "The measures I advocate in going north this time will certainly conflict with their interests." He announced that he would never compromise with the northern warlords and called on the people of the whole country to support his struggle.

When Mr. Sun Yat-sen was about to leave Shanghai for the north, although he was full of hope to achieve the peaceful reunification of the country, he estimated that it would be difficult to reach a consensus of opinion on the Beiyang warlords, who had imperialism as their background. He wrote a letter in English to me, instructing: If peaceful reunification is hopeless, then contact the National Second Army of Hu Jingyi stationed in Henan and the local forces of Sichuan and Yunnan, make full preparations, and seize the opportunity to recover Wuhan. Later, the evolution of the facts proved that Mr. Sun was far-sighted, and this was also his last instruction to me.

Mr. Sun publicized his revolutionary views along the way and was therefore warmly supported by the people of the whole country. Unfortunately, he fell ill due to overwork and was bedridden. On March 12, 1925, the revolutionary giant of a generation finally left us and passed away.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen was worthy of being a great revolutionary, thinker, and revolutionary leader of a generation. He struggled hard for the Chinese people for forty years, and even on his deathbed, he repeatedly exhorted the revolutionary party members to "must awaken the masses and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together," and predicted that "dawn will soon break," and that China and the Soviet Union "will join hands in the great battle to fight for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world to achieve victory!"

The wheels of history are moving forward. What is gratifying is that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, after a long period of hard struggle, finally broke the chains of imperialism and feudalism, ended the history of being oppressed and enslaved, and are working hard to build a new socialist China. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals, which he worked so hard for and dreamed of during his lifetime, have not only been realized, but also greatly exceeded in breadth and depth.

The Chinese Communist Party - the Chinese working class - the Chinese people are the heirs of all the beautiful ideas and progressive undertakings in the history of our motherland. When we are confidently building a new socialist life, we will never forget every drop of sweat and blood shed by our ancestors, and even more we cannot forget Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who fought for the motherland all his life. His great ideas, revolutionary achievements, and noble personality will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese people.

Now, we solemnly and warmly commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. To commemorate him is to better learn from him, to learn his spirit of loyalty and love for the motherland, to build and defend our great motherland. To learn his spirit of continuous progress, to follow in the footsteps of our ancestors, to move forward in the direction pointed out by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and to go all the way to socialism - communism!

    孙中山先生永远活在中国人民的心中
    熊克武
    孙中山先生诞生于1866年的11月12日，到现在已经整整的九十年了。孙中山先生为“求中国之自由平等”，献出了他的一生。解放了的中国人民，永远怀着崇高的敬意，来纪念为我们开辟胜利道路的革命先行者——孙中山先生。
    孙中山先生从1885年的中法之战失败起，就有了倾复清廷、创建民国的志向。在1894年的中日战争前后，开始了他的革命活动，在檀香山和香港组织兴中会，并在广州发动第一次武装起义；1905年在日本东京准备组织同盟会。当时我在东京大成中学读书，那一年7月初的一个星期天，在岩仓铁道学校读书的同学们谈起，程家柽在该校黑板上大书“孙逸仙先生到了东京”。我和同学但懋辛同志，一道去找程家柽，打听孙先生的住处。到了程家柽的住处后，他问明了来意，立即把孙先生请出来，原来孙先生当时就住在他的家里。孙先生很乐于和一般有志青年接谈，见面之后，没有俗例的客套，头一句话就说，你们青年有志革命救国很好。接着又问我们在日本学什么？我们答现在在大成中学，暑假后准备考入军事学校。他就说：列强想瓜分中国，清廷不图振作，我们爱国志士要及时采取行动，准备随时发难。如果必待学成后归国带了兵才干，恐怕不及待吧！革命党人只要学会打枪炮就够了，革命军与正规军所采取的战略战术迥然不同，只有冒险犯难，不畏牺牲，才可望成功。孙先生讲这些话的时候，言辞恳挚，态度雍容。我们当时也阅读了一些革命书报，具有初步的革命思想，积蓄了满腔的热血，要为祖国的独立自由而挥洒的。听了孙先生的这一席话感动极了，就不再加思索地表示愿意参加革命组织，提笔写好了同盟会的誓约，当面呈交给孙先生；孙先生和我们行会内同志的握手礼。这是我们跟孙先生见面的开始，也是在孙先生领导下从事革命活动的开始。
    那时候，对中国问题，有两种截然不同的路线：一种是改良主义者的路线，主张不要根本改变封建制度，只要建立君主立宪的国家，来发展本国的资本主义；一种是革命者的路线，主张推翻封建帝制，建立民主共和国，来实现救国救民的目的。历史证明，前者是走不通的，而且当广大人民已经觉醒起来以后，就变成了革命道路上的障碍物。孙中山先生在当时是采取了鲜明的革命的立场，而坚决反对改良主义的立场。
    我记得，大约在1905年的7月末，留日的中国学生在东京富士见楼开大会欢迎孙先生，孙先生在会上发表演说。他在缕述了清廷实行残酷民族压迫的事实之后，接着说：“有人以为中国维新从历史上看来，适宜于君主立宪政体。这种见解很不对。你们大家是日本留学生，知道日本的铁道是窄轨，欧美的铁道是宽轨，难道将来中国修铁道也要先修窄轨、然后才改宽轨吗！同学们为什么要到日本来留学，是不是想要中国富国强兵，独立自主？如果是这样的话，那么，同学们就要仔细想一想，现在清廷丧权辱国，有加无已，列强看破了清廷的无能，群起以我们祖国的大好河山，作为他们的逐鹿场，近来瓜分中国之说，甚嚣尘上，试问那些想侵占中国的列强，能够让中国逍遥自在地来改良吗？请大家下一番痛切的考虑，采取切实有效的方法，挽救中国的危亡！如果我们不能急起直追，推翻腐朽无能之清廷，建立独立自由之民国，那么，亡国灭种的惨祸，就会迫在眼前。孙先生言辞激越，气度轩昂，全场阒然无声，有人为之下泪。
    当时许多人参加革命，是出于单纯的排满；至于推翻清室以后，要建立一个什么样的国家，思想上还是不明确的。孙中山先生不仅提出了建立民主共和国的主张，而且注意到了如何避免欧美资本主义制度的流弊。他在同次大会上说：我们建立民国，还要防止资本家专政。现在世界上的共和国政权，都操在资本家手中，一般贫民不能受平等待遇，因而已有倡社会主义者。我国建国时要先注意民权，要用最新的政治建设。在那样的历史条件下，他能有这个看法，足见其眼光的远大，识见的超卓。孙先生的这些言论与见解，给我们这些追随他的人，以极其巨大的启示和影响。
    在同年末，孙中山先生介绍我同黄复生、曾冠三人到横滨，向梁慕光同志学习制造炸弹；孙先生也住在横滨，因此，接近的机会较多。他和我们相见的时候，经常注意了解国内各地方的具体情况，研究在当时环境下如何扩大革命影响。其时他在海外已有很多的联系，革命活动有了一定的基础。他要我们在国内多物色有志之士参加革命，特别在军队、学校和知识分子中间进行工作，要我们从这些方面把革命的影响扩大，把革命的行动加强起来。他之所以介绍我学制炸弹，也是为了回国后在革命的实际行动上准备条件。随后，我即衔命回国，进行革命活动。
    同盟会成立以后，曾在国内组织了好多次武装起义，如潮州、黄冈、惠州的起义，镇南关之役、广州新军起义等，其中规模最大、影响最深的，要算1911年3月29日的广州之役。这一役，聚集了海内外同志的大量人力、财力，向清朝反动统治作猛烈的冲击，许多同盟会的优秀同志都牺牲于这一役，其死事的壮烈，正如孙先生所说的，直可以“惊天地，泣鬼神”。我躬与斯役，和我一块作革命斗争的战友方声洞、林时爽、喻培伦、秦炳等，都在这一役壮烈地成仁了。由于这一次的失败，孙先生恐怕同志中产生悲观失望的情绪，鼓励大家培养力量，准备条件，再接再厉地继续革命事业。因而大家更振奋起来，终于取得辛亥革命的成就。
    民国成立，孙先生就任临时大总统。不久，辛亥革命的胜利果实，被以袁世凯为首的北洋军阀所篡夺了。1913年，袁世凯暗杀了宋教仁，免除南方几省国民党人担任的督军职务，并向五个帝国主义国家兴借巨款。孙先生起兵讨袁，我参加了这一斗争。讨袁失败后，孙先生亡命日本，我也到了东京。这正是中山先生有鉴于过去的组织太松懈，意志不统一，决定组织中华革命党的时候。我会见了孙先生，参加了中华革命党。1915年，袁世凯窃国称帝，先生再次起兵讨袁，我也参加了讨袁的军事行动。
    袁世凯死了，其他各派军阀又起来，张勋、曹锟、吴佩孚等相继窃据北京政权。这时的中国，正处于“长夜漫漫何时旦”的黑暗中，孙中山先生进行了一次又一次的奋斗，也经历了一次又一次的失败，并且因为找不到能够使革命达到胜利的道路而感到痛苦，但是他并没有放下斗争的旗帜。他终于在绝望中遇到了十月革命和中国共产党，开始了他一生中最伟大的转变。孙先生接受了国际工人阶级和中国工人阶级给他的帮助，勇敢地采取了联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策；并且在这三大政策的基础上，召开国民党第一次全国代表大会，改组了他所手创的中国国民党。那时，我在军中，由孙先生提名，被选为中央委员，这是我第一次担任党的职务，感到非常光荣。孙先生曾派同志来传达实行三大政策的重大决定，我由此也就体认到和苏联建立友好关系，和中国共产党结成亲密的革命联盟，把反对帝国主义列为首要的革命任务，对于中国革命的发展，具有着不可估量的意义。
    当孙中山先生在苏联和中国共产党帮助之下，革命力量蓬勃发展起来的时候，曹锟、吴佩孚的反动力量也在逐步扩张，孙先生希望我们整顿部队，安定地方，为响应北伐、打倒军阀作准备。其时曹锟贿选总统，孙先生兴师讨贼，亲下手令任命我为讨贼军川军总司令。我有了孙先生的坚强领导，同吴佩孚动员的北洋军阀体系的直、鲁、豫、川、黔、鄂等省军队作了好多次的战斗。后来我移师湘西，正是孙先生由上海启程北上的时候，他在
  “北上宣言”中宣布，这一次北上，他的目的“不仅在复灭曹吴，尤在曹吴复灭之后，永无同样继起之人；………不仅在推倒军阀，尤在推倒军阀所赖以生存之帝国主义”。要求
  “使武力与帝国主义结合之现象，永绝迹于国内”。他接受中国共产党的主张，号召举行召集有各界人民团体、反对曹吴各军及各政党参加的国民会议，共同解决国内问题，并废除不平等条约。他的主张是鲜明的，与张作霖、段祺瑞尖锐地对立着的。他在上海招待新闻记者时说：“我这次往北方去，所主张的办法，一定是和他们的利益相冲突。”他宣布他决不与北方军阀相妥协，号召全国人民支持他的斗争。
    在孙中山先生将从上海动身北上的时候，虽然满怀希望实现国家的和平统一，但估计到对以帝国主义为背景的北洋军阀，意见将是难于求得一致的。他写了一封英文信给我，指示：如果和平统一无望，即行联络驻在河南的国民二军胡景翼部和川滇的地方实力，作充分的准备，相机规复武汉。后来，事实的演变证明孙先生是有远见的，这也是他对我的最后一次指示。
    孙先生沿途宣传他的革命主张，并因此受到全国人民的热烈拥护。不幸因积劳成疾，卧病不起。1925年的3月12日，一代革命巨人终于离开我们而长逝了。
    孙中山先生不愧为伟大的革命家、思想家，不愧为一代的革命领袖，他为中国人民辛辛苦苦地奋斗了四十年，一直到临终的时候，还谆谆嘱咐革命党人“必须唤起民众及联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗”，并预言“不久即将破晓”，中国和苏“在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利！”
    历史的车轮向前推进，值得欣慰的是，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，经过长时期的艰苦奋斗，终于挣断了帝国主义和封建主义的锁链，结束了被压迫被奴役的历史，正在努力建设社会主义的新中国。孙中山先生生前苦心焦虑、梦寐以求的理想，不仅已经实现了；而且在其广度和深度上，大大地超过了。
    中国共产党——中国工人阶级——中国人民是我们祖国历史上一切美好思想和进步事业的继承人，当我们正在满怀信心地建设社会主义新生活的时候，绝不会忘记我们先人所流出的每一滴汗血，更不能忘记为祖国战斗了一生的孙中山先生。他的伟大思想、革命功业和崇高人格，将永远活在中国人民的心中。
    现在，我们隆重地热烈地纪念孙中山先生诞生九十周年。我们纪念他，就是要更好地学习他，学习他忠心耿耿热爱祖国的精神，建设和保卫我们的伟大祖国。学习他不断进步的精神，跟随着我们先人已经走过的足迹，向着共产党和毛主席所指引的方向，向前迈进，一直走到社会主义——共产主义！
