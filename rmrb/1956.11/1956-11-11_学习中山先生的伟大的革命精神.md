    Learning from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Great Revolutionary Spirit
    Wang Shao'ao
    The ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth is approaching. As we commemorate this great democratic revolutionary, statesman, and thinker, we cannot help but recall his great revolutionary spirit. He was not only strong and resolute in the revolutionary cause, unafraid of difficulties and dangers, strategic and far-sighted, but he also possessed a great spirit and demeanor, capable of uniting people from all walks of life to fight together for the democratic revolution. Here are a few things based on my personal experiences.
    After the victory of the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty's autocratic rule and established the Republic of China, Mr. Sun Yat-sen served as the Provisional President of the Nanjing Government. I and my mentor from the Restoration Society, Mr. Zhang Taiyan, went to the Presidential Palace in Nanjing to meet with Mr. Sun Yat-sen to discuss national affairs. Although I was not a member of the Restoration Society, Mr. Sun Yat-sen treated me sincerely without exception. He repeatedly encouraged Mr. Taiyan and me to strive for the revolutionary cause. However, this caused uneasiness and jealousy in Chen Qimei, who sent Chiang Kai-shek and his henchmen to assassinate Tao Chengzhang, the head of the Zhejiang Restoration Society, in early 1912, causing Mr. Taiyan to have a great misunderstanding of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. This was truly unexpected by Mr. Sun Yat-sen and was certainly not his intention.
    During the Constitutional Protection Movement in 1918, Mr. Sun Yat-sen initiated the convening of an Extraordinary Congress in Guangzhou. I actively responded to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Constitutional Protection Movement and immediately went to Guangzhou to participate in the Extraordinary Congress. Among the members of the Extraordinary Congress at that time, I was the only one who was not a member of the Kuomintang, so I was discriminated against and excluded by some Kuomintang members. But Mr. Sun Yat-sen did not think so at all. Every time he saw me, he always showed great kindness and concern, which deeply moved me.
    In 1924, Mr. Sun Yat-sen risked traveling from Guangzhou to the north to negotiate with Duan Qirui on the issue of convening a National Assembly. Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated for the immediate convening of a popularly elected National Assembly, promoting democracy and abolishing unequal treaties. Duan Qirui and other warlords, for their own selfish purposes, opposed convening a popularly elected National Assembly. As soon as Mr. Sun Yat-sen arrived in Tianjin, his movements were restricted, and it was not easy for ordinary guests to meet him at his residence. I went to see him two or three times at that time, but was always "turned away." Mr. Sun Yat-sen usually loved to be close to the masses, especially enjoying meeting with revolutionaries, so he was very angry in that situation. He repeatedly broke through the encirclement and obstruction of the warlords, went to various places to give speeches, and promoted his revolutionary propositions of convening a National Assembly and abolishing unequal treaties to awaken the masses. But due to his liver disease worsening, he unfortunately passed away on March 12, 1925.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life was a revolutionary life. His Three Great Policies and his advocacy of learning from Russia, his advocacy of convening a National Assembly and abolishing unequal treaties, his advocacy of awakening the people and uniting with all oppressed nations in the world to fight together, played a significant guiding role in our country's revolution. Today, as we commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, the people of our country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have brilliantly realized Mr. Sun Yat-sen's propositions and carried them forward. Our current task is to learn from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit as a great revolutionary, his great spirit and demeanor, to better unite all positive forces at home and abroad that can be united, and to strive to build our country into an advanced socialist industrialized nation.

    学习中山先生的伟大的革命精神
    王绍鏊
    孙中山先生九十诞辰即将到来。当我们纪念这个伟大的民主主义革命家、政治家和思想家的时候，我们不能不回忆起他的伟大的革命精神。他对革命事业不仅坚强刚毅，不怕困难，不怕危险，有政略，有远见；而且他有伟大的气魄和风度，能团结四面八方的人物，为民主革命而共同奋斗。这里根据我亲身体验到的，谈几桩事情。
    1911年辛亥革命胜利之后，推翻了清朝专制统治，建立了中华民国，中山先生担任了南京临时政府大总统，我和光复会导师章太炎先生同赴南京总统府会见中山先生商谈国是。我虽然不是光复会的成员，中山先生也毫不例外地诚恳相待。他一再勉励太炎先生和我为革命事业努力奋斗。可是这件事却引起了陈其美的不安和嫉妒，在1912年初派了蒋介石和他的爪牙刺杀了浙江光复会负责人陶成章，使太炎先生对中山先生发生很大的误会，这实在出乎中山先生的意料，也绝非中山先生的心愿。
    1918年护法之役，中山先生在广州发起召开非常国会，我积极响应中山先生的护法运动，并立即到广州参加非常国会。当时参加非常国会的议员中，只有我一人不是国民党员，因此遭到某些国民党人的歧视和排挤。但是中山先生大不为然，他每次见到我总表示非常亲切和关怀，使我深受感动。
    1924年中山先生从广州冒险到北方来，同段祺瑞谈判召开国民会议问题。中山先生主张马上召开民选的国民会议，发扬民主和废除不平等条约。段祺瑞和其他的军阀为了自私的目的，都反对召开民选的国民会议。中山先生一到天津，行动就受到了限制，他的寓所不易接见一般宾客。我当时两三次去看他，也都遭到“挡驾”。中山先生平素是很爱接近群众的，特别是喜欢同革命人士晤谈，所以他处在那种情况下非常愤怒，他屡次冲破了军阀们的包围和阻挠，赴各处讲演，宣传他召开国民会议和废除不平等条约的革命主张，以唤起群众觉悟。但终因肝疾转剧，于1925年3月12日不幸逝世。
    中山先生的一生是革命的一生。他的三大政策和以俄为师的主张，他的召开国民会议和废除不平等条约的主张，他的唤起民众及联合世界上一切被压迫的民族共同奋斗的主张，对我国革命起了重大的指导作用。今天我们纪念中山先生九十诞辰的时候，我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下已经光辉地实现了中山先生的主张，并且把它发扬光大。我们当前的任务，就是要学习中山先生伟大的革命家的精神，他的伟大的气魄和风度，更好地团结国内外一切可以团结的积极力量，为把我国建设成为先进的社会主义工业化的国家而奋斗。
