    Sights and Sounds from the National Class A Basketball League

    Sister Athletes

    On the afternoon of November 24th, the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education and the "August 1st" Women's team faced off. Wang Peizhen of the Shanghai team met her sister, Wang Heimei (a member of the "August 1st" team) on the court. This was the fourth time the sisters had met as opponents. In a match in Shanghai in 1954, both sisters played center, and during a jump ball, the younger sister injured the older sister's leg. After the game, they returned home, and the younger sister was scolded by their mother.

    Wang Heimei and Wang Peizhen are very close sisters. They often exchange basketball techniques and experiences. The younger sister often learns fast break and shooting techniques from her sister, and the older sister also learns rebounding and baseline dribbling techniques from her sister.

    Teacher-Student Battle of Wits

    Tang Baokun, the experienced coach of the "August 1st" Men's team with thirty years of experience on the court, engaged in fierce strategic competition with several of his students in this league. When the "August 1st" Men's team played against the Shenyang Military Region Men's team, Tang Baokun and his student Lan Wenzhi, the coach of the Shenyang Military Region Men's team, both devised a set of fast-attacking tactics targeting each other's weaknesses. The Shenyang Military Region team initially gained an advantage, but the "August 1st" team caught up, leading to a seesaw battle. Early in the second half, the Shenyang Military Region team regained a nine-point lead, and Tang Baokun quickly redeployed his strategy. However, this time Lan Wenzhi did not understand his teacher's strategy, and the Shenyang Military Region team continued to lose ground. As soon as the game ended, Tang Baokun immediately pointed out Lan Wenzhi's mistake of not controlling the ball well when they were winning. He also praised him for the appropriate use of perimeter screening and seizing opportunities to cut into the basket tactics.

    On the league court, there is often a group of young men and veteran coaches studying tactics together. They are Tang Baokun and his students: Xia Kun, coach of the Public Security Army Men's Basketball Team; Lan Wenzhi, coach of the Shenyang Military Region Men's Basketball Team; Wang Huanxin, coach of the Beijing Military Region Men's Basketball Team; Chen Renkang, coach of the Guangzhou Military Region Men's Basketball Team; and Zhao Xueyuan and Wang Qi, coaches of the "August 1st" Women's team. The students often observe how the teacher masters on-the-spot changes. When the teams of the students are about to play, they always discuss their strategy with the teacher first. When the time comes, the 47-year-old coach also loves to stay by his students' side, giving them pointers when necessary.

    The Last Three Minutes

    In this competition, there were as many as eight games where the outcome was decided by a difference of one or two points in the last few seconds or tens of seconds of a match.

    The games between the Beijing Municipality and "August 1st" Men's teams, and between the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education and Chengdu Institute of Physical Education Women's teams, saw comebacks from defeat in the last two or three seconds. The Shanghai Institute of Physical Education Women's team lost to the Shenyang Institute of Physical Education Women's team by two points on the 18th. On the evening of the 27th, in the last game of the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education Women's team against the Coal Mine Sports Association Women's team, they initially fell behind again. The Shanghai team members were relatively nervous and desperately tried to catch up, but they were still at a disadvantage until the last three minutes. With only a few seconds left in the game, the Coal Mine team was still winning by one point. At this moment, a Coal Mine team player inadvertently fouled, and the Shanghai team took a free throw. As a result, the Shanghai team reversed the defeat with a score of 59 to 58.

### 全国甲级队篮球联赛见闻

    全国甲级队篮球联赛见闻
    姐妹运动员
    11月24日下午，上海体育学院和“八一”女子队交锋。上海队的王佩珍和他的姐姐王黑梅（“八一”队队员）在球场上会见了。姐妹俩像这样作为对手的会见，已经是第四次了。1954年有一次在上海比赛，姐姐和妹妹都打中锋，因为争球，妹妹把姐姐的腿撞伤了。比赛完毕，她们两人回到家里，妹妹被妈妈骂了一顿。
    王黑梅和王佩珍是很要好的一对姐妹。她们经常交流打球的技术和经验。妹妹常向姐姐学习快攻和投篮技术，姐姐也向妹妹学习投篮板球和底线过人的技术。
    师生斗智
    “八一”男子队有着三十年球场经验的老指导唐宝堃，在这一次联赛中和自己培养出来的几个学生在战略上展开剧烈的竞争。当“八一”男子队和沈阳部队男子队比赛的时候，唐宝堃和他的学生沈阳部队男子队指导蓝文治都针对对方弱点，布置了一套快速进攻的战术。沈阳部队队开始得利，后来“八一”队赶上，形成拉锯局面。下半场开始不久，沈阳部队队又赢九分，唐宝堃赶紧重新部署，可是这一回蓝文治没有了解他老师的战略，沈阳部队队就一直失利。比赛刚完，唐宝堃马上就指出蓝文治在赢球的时候没有很好控制球的错误。同时也夸赞他对外围掩护、乘机切入战术运用的恰当。
    在联赛的球场上，经常有一堆年轻小伙子和老指导在一块研究战术。他们是唐宝堃和他的学生，——公安军男子篮球队指导夏堃、沈阳部队男子篮球队指导蓝文治、北京部队男子篮球队指导王焕新、广州部队男子篮球队指导陈仁康和“八一”女队的指导赵学元、王琦。学生们常常观看老师如何掌握临场变化。当学生们所在的队要出阵的时候，总是先将自己的战略和老师商量。到了临场的时候，这个已经四十七岁的老指导也很爱守在学生们旁边，必要时给他们指点一下。
    最后三分钟
    在这次比赛中，常常在一场的最后几秒、或几十秒钟，以一、二分之差决定胜负的比赛竟有八场之多。
    北京市与“八一”男队，上海体育学院和成都体育学院女队的比赛，都是在最后二、三秒钟，出现转败为胜的场面。上海体育学院女子队在18日以二分之差输给沈阳体育学院女子队。27日晚，上海体育学院女子队在最后一场与煤矿体育协会女子队比赛中，起初又失利，上海队队员比较紧张，拚力急追，直到最后三分钟仍然处于劣势。离比赛结束只有几秒钟，煤矿队还赢上海队一分。这时，煤矿队员不慎犯规，上海队罚球，结果上海队以五十九对五十八扭转了败局。
