Xinhua News Agency, November 5th. Letters and telegrams from people across China expressing support for the just struggle of the Egyptian people have been pouring into the Egyptian Embassy in China like snowflakes in recent days. In the four days from November 2nd to 5th, the Egyptian Embassy in China has received over two thousand letters and telegrams of support.

The letters and telegrams of support come from the border regions of our country, the Kangzang Plateau, the southeast coast, and major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Wuhan. The writers include workers, students, government employees, and farmers, as well as scientists, artists, members of various democratic parties, people's organizations, the industrial and commercial sector, religious circles, overseas Chinese, and non-party democratic人士.

Among the more than two thousand letters and telegrams of support, all express that the six hundred million Chinese people stand firmly with the Egyptian people and fully support Egypt. A letter marked "A loyal friend of the Egyptian people - a Chinese family" reads: "We are extremely angry at the shameless aggression of British and French imperialism against Egypt, and at the same time, we are filled with the most profound respect upon hearing the news that President Nasser is leading the entire Egyptian people in a resolute struggle. We will resolutely not allow the parents, brothers, sisters, and children of Egypt to suffer, and our hearts are with you every moment." The letter is signed with the names of the family head, Guo Zichuan, and his family of five, and also includes a photo of the Young Pioneer, Guo Xiaolin.

Many Muslims who believe in Islam throughout the country wrote letters in Arabic to express their support for the just struggle of the Egyptian people. All the Muslims in Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, telegraphed Ambassador Ragheb on the 4th, saying that the Muslim men and women in Jiaxing City are extremely angry at the British and French imperialist aggression against Egypt, and we firmly support your just struggle.

    支援埃及的函电如雪片飞向埃及大使馆
    新华社5日讯　我国各地人民表示支援埃及人民正义斗争的书信和电报连日来像雪片似的飞向埃及驻中国大使馆里来。从2日到5日的四天中，埃及驻华大使馆已收到两千多封支援书信和电报。
    支援书信和电报来自我国的边疆、康藏高原、东南沿海各地和上海、天津、沈阳、武汉等各大城市。写信的人有工人、学生、机关干部和农民，还有科学家、艺术家、各民主党派、人民团体以及工商界、宗教界、华侨和无党派民主人士。
    在两千多封支援书信和电报中，一致表示：六亿中国人民坚决和埃及人民站在一起，以全力支持埃及。一封注明“埃及人民的忠实朋友——中国的一个家庭”的信中写道：“我们怀着极大的愤怒来反对英、法帝国主义对埃及的无耻侵略，同时我们也怀着最崇敬的心情，听到纳赛尔总统领导全埃及人民坚决进行斗争的消息。我们坚决不让埃及的父母兄弟和小朋友受苦难，我们的心每时每刻都和你们在一起。”这封信下面签着这个家庭的家长郭子川一家五口人的名字，还附有少先队员郭小林的照片。
    全国各地许多信仰伊斯兰教的穆斯林们，用阿拉伯文写信表示支援埃及人民的正义斗争。浙江省嘉兴市全体穆斯林4日打电报给拉加布大使说，嘉兴市的穆斯林男女对英法帝国主义侵略埃及都感到无比愤怒，我们坚决支持你们的正义斗争。
