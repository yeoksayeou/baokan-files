    The people of all countries attach great importance to the eleventh United Nations General Assembly, which opened yesterday. Due to the armed aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, and the disruption of peace in the Middle East, and due to the international reactionaries stepping up their conspiracies to interfere in the internal affairs of people's democratic countries, and taking advantage of the situation in Hungary to create an anti-Soviet and anti-communist Cold War movement, the international situation, which had been easing for a year, is now tending to become tense again. This new international countercurrent is a serious challenge to the UN Charter, to peace and international security, and the United Nations should resolutely stop it in order to maintain peace and promote international cooperation.
    Recently, the United Nations has been engaged in intense activity regarding the Middle East situation. It has successively passed resolutions demanding a ceasefire in Egypt and the immediate withdrawal of British, French, and Israeli aggressor troops from Egypt. This is the first time since the United States, under the banner of the United Nations, invaded Korea and brought shame upon the United Nations, that the United Nations has made a resolution against aggressors that conforms to the Charter and the just demands of the people of all countries. Although the British, French, and Israeli aggressors, under the enormous pressure of world peace forces and the serious warnings of the Soviet Union, had to announce a ceasefire, the British and French aggressors have not only refused to implement the United Nations resolutions and withdraw their invading troops from Egypt, but are also attempting to use the international emergency force organized by the United Nations to take over the areas illegally occupied by Britain, France, and Israel in Egypt, in order to achieve the despicable aim of depriving Egypt of its sacred sovereignty over the Suez Canal. And the United States, disguised as a "peace envoy," is stepping up its efforts to take advantage of British and French aggression in order to achieve its own selfish goal of controlling Egypt. This conspiracy of the imperialist bloc is something that the people of all countries can never allow. The United Nations must assume the sacred responsibility stipulated in the Charter and must not allow this conspiracy to succeed. The British, French, and Israeli aggressor troops must unconditionally withdraw from Egypt, and Egypt's sovereignty and territory must not be violated in any form. The Suez Canal issue must be resolved peacefully on the basis of respect for Egyptian sovereignty.
    At the same time, the United States, Britain, France, and their followers have repeatedly forced the United Nations to illegally discuss the so-called "Hungarian situation" and pass resolutions slandering the Soviet Union, attempting to divert world attention from the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel in Egypt and the conspiracy of the United States, Britain, and France to infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty, while attempting to use the United Nations to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs, incite anti-Soviet and anti-people's democratic countries' criminal activities, and further aggravate international tensions. The recent events in Hungary are purely internal affairs of Hungary, and the United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere. The United States, Britain, France, and their followers forcing the United Nations to discuss this is a complete violation of the Charter and a gross interference in Hungary's internal affairs. Therefore, in order to maintain the dignity of the United Nations Charter and prevent it from being tarnished, the United Nations must immediately remove the so-called "Hungarian situation" issue from the agenda.
    The Eleventh United Nations General Assembly also faces urgent tasks in other areas in maintaining peace and the independent sovereignty of all countries. France continues to expand its dirty colonial war in Algeria and has despicably kidnapped the leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front, undermining efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the Algerian issue, making the situation in North Africa even more tense. The legitimate aspirations of the Cypriot people for autonomy and an end to Britain's brutal colonial rule continue to be ignored. The issue of the return of West Irian to Indonesia has also not been resolved to this day. The United States is increasingly undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement, deepening and widening the confrontation between North and South Korea, and threatening peace in Korea. The United Nations should take effective measures to resolve all these issues justly and reasonably.
    Achieving universal disarmament and banning atomic and hydrogen weapons to consolidate world peace is the common demand of the people of the world. Last year, the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries made many efforts and independently greatly reduced their troops, and this practical action proves that the conditions for resolving this urgent international problem have matured. However, the United States, Britain, France, and other Western countries have obstructed the resolution of this problem, so that the United Nations Disarmament Committee and the Disarmament Subcommittee have so far accomplished nothing. The United Nations General Assembly should assume its unshirkable responsibility and make decisions that will lead to practical progress in effectively resolving this problem, to promote international trust and establish peaceful cooperation between countries.
    Last year, the United Nations General Assembly broke the United States' stubborn stance of excluding peaceful and democratic countries from participating in the United Nations and admitted sixteen new member states. However, the issue of the universality of United Nations membership still needs to be completely resolved rationally. The legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China, which has a quarter of the world's population, are still being arbitrarily deprived in the United Nations. Facts have proven that this cannot stop the increasing international status and influence of the People's Republic of China, but it seriously damages the prestige of the United Nations and its role in maintaining peace. Wide world public opinion and an increasing number of member states in the United Nations advocate that this abnormal and harmful situation must be changed, which is completely justified. However, the ruling clique in the United States is still doing everything possible to adhere to its unrealistic policy and is trying once again to obstruct the United Nations from restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. They are doing this in order to continue to be hostile to the People's Republic of China and maintain and exacerbate the tense situation in the Far East. This is resolutely opposed by all those who uphold peace and the United Nations Charter. The United Nations General Assembly should immediately expel the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and restore the legitimate rights and status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
    Under the current situation, it is of great significance to safeguard the United Nations Charter and strengthen the role and prestige of the United Nations. Thanks to the efforts of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the Asian-African group of countries, the previous United Nations General Assembly had some new atmosphere, making it impossible for the United States to easily control the entire United Nations as it did in the past. Over the past year, the strength of socialist forces has continued to increase, and the anti-colonialist struggle has risen to an unprecedented height, giving the imperialist bloc a greater blow. However, the United States and other Western countries are attempting to strengthen their control over the United Nations, making the Eleventh United Nations General Assembly a tool for them to create tension. This cannot but subject the United Nations to yet another new and serious test. It is believed that all peace-loving countries in the United Nations will work harder to safeguard the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, resolutely confront the countercurrent of an anti-peace and anti-national independence movement that international reactionary forces are stepping up to plan and carry out, so that this session of the General Assembly can make due contributions to easing international tensions and consolidating world peace.

    十一届联大应为缓和国际局势作出贡献
    各国人民异常重视昨天开幕的第十一届联合国大会。由于英、法、以色列武装侵略埃及、破坏中东和平，由于国际反动势力加紧阴谋干涉人民民主国家的内政，正在利用匈牙利局势制造反苏反共的冷战运动，使得一年来有了和缓的国际局势又在趋向紧张。这股新的国际逆流是对联合国宪章、和平和国际安全的严重挑衅，联合国应当坚决加以制止，以维护和平，促进国际合作。
    最近联合国曾经对中东局势进行了紧张活动。它先后通过决议，要求在埃及实行停火，英、法、以色列侵略军队立即撤出埃及。这是自从美国打着联合国旗帜侵略朝鲜，使联合国蒙受耻辱以来，联合国第一次对侵略者作出的符合宪章和各国人民正义要求的决议。英、法、以色列侵略者虽然在世界和平力量的巨大压力和苏联的严重警告之下不得不宣布停火，但是英、法侵略者至今不但拒不执行联合国的决议，而把它们的侵略军队撤出埃及，而且正企图利用联合国通过组织的国际紧急部队，来接管英、法、以色列在埃及所非法占领的地区，以达到剥夺埃及对苏伊士运河神圣主权的卑劣目的。而乔装改扮成“和平使者”的美国，正在加紧利用英法的侵略，以图达到自己的控制埃及的自私目的。帝国主义集团的这个阴谋是各国人民决不能容许的。联合国必须负起宪章所规定的神圣职责，决不可容许这种阴谋得逞，英、法、以色列侵略军队必须无条件地撤出埃及，埃及的主权和领土不容受到任何形式的侵犯，苏伊士运河问题必须在尊重埃及主权的基础上谋求和平解决。
    与此同时，美、英、法及其追随者一再强使联合国非法讨论所谓“匈牙利局势”，并通过诬蔑苏联的提案，企图借此转移世界对英、法、以色列在埃及的侵略和美、英、法侵犯埃及主权的阴谋的注意力，同时企图利用联合国来干涉匈牙利的内政，煽动反苏反人民民主国家的种种罪恶活动，进一步加剧国际紧张局势。匈牙利国内最近发生的事件，纯属匈牙利内部的事情，联合国完全无权过问。美、英、法及其追随者迫使联合国讨论，是完全违反宪章的行为，是对匈牙利内政的粗暴干涉。因此，为了维护联合国宪章的尊严而不被污损，联合国必须把所谓“匈牙利局势”问题立即从议程上撤消。
    第十一届联合国大会还在其他方面面临着维护和平和各国独立主权的迫切任务。法国继续扩大在阿尔及利亚进行肮脏的殖民战争，并卑鄙地绑架阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线领袖，破坏谋求和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的努力，使北非的局势更趋紧张。塞浦路斯人民要求自治，结束英国残酷的殖民统治的正当愿望，依然受到漠视。西伊里安归还印度尼西亚的问题也至今没有解决。美国正在有加无已地破坏朝鲜停战协定，加深和扩大南北朝鲜的对立，使朝鲜和平受到威胁。所有这些问题，联合国都应该采取有效措施来公正合理地加以解决。
    实现普遍裁军和禁止原子武器和氢武器，以巩固世界和平，这是世界人民的共同要求。去年，苏联和各人民民主国家作了许多努力，并且单独地大量裁减了军队，这个实际行动证明解决这个急不容缓的国际问题的条件已经成熟。但是，美、英、法等西方国家阻挠了这个问题的解决，使得联合国裁军委员会和裁军小组委员会至今一事无成。联合国大会应该负担起无可旁贷的责任，作出足以导致有效解决这个问题的实际进展的决定，来促进国际信任，确立各国之间的和平合作。
    去年联合国大会曾打破美国排斥和平民主国家参加联合国的顽固立场，接纳了十六个新的会员国。但是，联合国的会员国必须具有普遍性的问题，还有待合理地予以完全解决。拥有全世界人口四分之一的中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，至今仍横遭剥夺。事实证明这并不能阻挡中华人民共和国的国际地位和影响的日益增长，而却使联合国的威信和维护和平的作用受到严重的损害。世界广泛舆论和联合国中越来越多的会员国，都主张必须改变这个不正常的有害情况，这是完全正当的。但是美国统治集团至今仍在千方百计地坚持它的不现实的政策，力图再一次阻挠联合国恢复我国在联合国的合法权利。他们这样做是为了继续敌视中华人民共和国，保持和加剧远东的紧张局势。这是所有维护和平和联合国宪章的人们所坚决反对的。联合国大会应该立即驱逐蒋介石集团的代表，并恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利和地位。
    在目前形势下，维护联合国宪章，加强联合国的作用和威信，具有重大的意义。由于苏联、各人民民主国家和亚非集团国家的努力，上届联合国大会已出现了一些新的气象，使美国不能像过去那样容易地把整个联合国控制在它的手里了。一年来，社会主义力量继续加强，反殖民主义的斗争空前高涨，给了帝国主义集团更大的打击。但是，美国和其他西方国家正在企图加强对联合国的控制，使第十一届联合国大会成为它们制造紧张局势的工具。这不能不使得联合国面临着又一次新的严重考验。人们相信，联合国中一切爱好和平的国家将会更加努力来维护联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，坚决对抗国际反动势力加紧策划和进行的一股反和平反民族独立运动的逆流，使本届大会能够为和缓国际局势、巩固世界和平作出应有的贡献。
