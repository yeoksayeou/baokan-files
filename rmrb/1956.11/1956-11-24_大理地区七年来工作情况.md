Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 23rd - Wang Min, Secretary of the CPC Dali Local Committee, reported on the work situation of the past seven years at the first session of the First People's Congress of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture on behalf of the Local Committee.

He said: Since the completion of land reform in the Dali area in 1953, after more than three years of cooperative work, a high tide of socialist transformation was set off throughout the region last winter and this spring, and a decisive victory was achieved in a very short time. By June of this year, more than 283,000 farm households out of more than 300,900 farm households in the region had joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, accounting for about 92% of the total number of farm households. Among them, farm households participating in advanced agricultural cooperatives accounted for 45% of the farm households that had joined the cooperatives. The socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce in the region has also been basically completed.

He said: Over the past seven years, industrial and agricultural production and other economic and cultural undertakings have been actively restored and developed, and the living standards of all ethnic groups have been gradually improved on the basis of production development. The total grain output has greatly increased in recent years. In 1955, it increased by more than 24% compared with 1952, and it is expected to increase by about 10% this year compared with last year. Calculated on the basis of the agricultural population of the entire region, each person in the region had only more than 628 jin of grain in 1952, and this year it is estimated that each person will have an average of 839 jin. The planting area and total output of economic crops such as cotton, flue-cured tobacco, and rapeseed have also increased rapidly. There was very little industry in the Dali area originally. In recent years, more than 30 factories and mines have been newly built and expanded, and the total output value has increased from 1.7 million yuan in 1952 to more than 4.7 million yuan last year. The people's purchasing power has increased by more than 56% last year compared with 1952. With the development of production and the improvement of people's living standards, commerce, culture, education, health, transportation and other undertakings have also developed accordingly.

He said: In recent years, following the Party's correct ethnic policies, all ethnic groups have been united in a friendly family, a large number of local ethnic cadres have been trained in various tasks, Party and League organizations have been developed, and a large number of ethnic cadres have been promoted to participate in the leadership of Party and government departments, creating the necessary basis for the establishment of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture. The report also reviewed and summarized the experiences and lessons learned in the work over the past few years. He pointed out: In leading agricultural production, in dealing with the relationship between agriculture and sideline occupations, personal interests and collective interests, and national interests, there are still shortcomings of subjectivism and bureaucracy such as generalized leadership, one-sidedness, and neglect of ethnic characteristics, which must be resolutely overcome in the future. The report also put forward opinions on the work for next year, and submitted them to the congress for discussion.

    大理地区七年来工作情况
    新华社昆明23日电　中共云南省大理地方委员会书记王民代表地委在大理白族自治州第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上报告了七年来的工作情况。
    他说：大理地区自从1953年完成土地改革以后，经过三年多的合作化工作，去冬今春在全区掀起了社会主义改造高潮，在很短时间内取得了决定性胜利。到今年6月，全区三十万零九千多个农户中已有二十八万三千多个农户加入了农业生产合作社，约占农户总数的92％。其中参加高级农业社的农户，已占入社农户的45％。全区的手工业和资本主义工商业也基本上完成了社会主义改造。
    他说：七年来积极地恢复和发展了工农业生产和其他经济文化事业，并在生产发展的基础上逐步提高了各族人民的生活水平。几年来粮食总产量有很大增加，1955年比1952年增加24％以上，预计今年又比去年增产一成左右。以全区农业人口计算，1952年全区每人只有粮食六百二十八斤多，今年每人平均预计有八百三十九斤。棉花、烤烟、油菜等经济作物的种植面积和总产量也都有迅速的增加。大理区原有的工业极少，几年来新建和扩建了三十多个厂矿，总产值已由1952年的一百七十万元增长到去年的四百七十多万元。人民购买力去年比1952年已提高56％以上。随着生产的发展和人民生活的提高，商业、文教卫生、交通运输等事业也有了相应的发展。
    他说：几年来遵循了党的正确民族政策，各民族已经团结在一个友好的大家庭里，在各项工作中大量培养了当地民族干部，发展了党团组织，提拔了大批民族干部参加党和政府部门的领导工作，为建立大理白族自治州创造了必要的基础。报告中还检查和总结了几年来工作中的经验教训。他指出：在领导农业生产上、在对待农业和副业、个人利益和集体利益、国家利益等关系方面，还存在着领导一般化、片面性和忽视民族特点等主观主义和官僚主义的缺点，今后必须坚决克服。报告中最后还提出明年工作的意见，提请大会讨论。
