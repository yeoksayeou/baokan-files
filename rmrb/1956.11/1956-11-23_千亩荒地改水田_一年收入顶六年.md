    Thousand Mu of Barren Land Converted to Paddy Fields, One Year's Income Equals Six Years'

    The thousand mu of low-lying ponds in the Third Work Zone of the Taiyangsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Fuxian County, Liaoning, were adjacent to the Fuzhou River. In the past, they were always flooded nine years out of ten, and the grain harvest was very small.

    After the realization of advanced cooperativization this spring, the cooperative led the members to build an eight-li long canal and a solid dam, and transformed the low-lying ponds in the Third Work Zone into nine hundred paddy fields, finally turning harmful water into beneficial water, and low-lying land into fertile land.

    According to the cooperative's actual measurement, this low-lying land can produce 1,500 jin of rice per mu this year, with a total harvest of 1.5 million jin, which is six times more income than planting corn. The members are all smiling from ear to ear. They said happily: "This is what we call 'Thousand mu of barren land converted to paddy fields, one year's income equals six years'!" ·Xiu Hua, Dong Ge·

    千亩荒地改水田  一年收入顶六年
    辽宁复县太阳升农业社第三作业区的千亩洼塘，紧靠复州河，在过去总是十年九涝，收粮很少。
    今年春季实现高级合作化以后，社里领导社员修筑了八里长的水渠和坚固的拦河坝，并把第三作业区的洼塘地修成了九百个水稻池，终于使害水变成了利水，洼地变成了良田。
    经社里实地测算，这块洼地今年一亩可产一千五百斤水稻，总共可收一百五十万斤，比种苞米能增加六倍的收入。社员们都乐得合不上嘴。他们高兴地说：“这就叫‘千亩荒地改水田，一年收入顶六年’哪！”　　　　·秀华、东阁·
