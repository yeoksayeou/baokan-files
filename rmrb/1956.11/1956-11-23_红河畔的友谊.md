    Friendship on the Banks of the Red River
    By Zhan Chao, Our Correspondent in Vietnam

    Incense smoke curled and bells echoed in the Temple of the Two Trung Queens in Hanoi.

    Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Marshal He Long, during their four-day visit to Vietnam, made a special trip to the front of the main hall to pay respects and lay flowers to Vietnam's two female national heroes, Trung Trac and Trung Nhi.

    Trung Trac and Trung Nhi were sisters who, more than 1,900 years ago, in the year 40 AD, led a mass uprising and drove away Su Ding, the Chinese dynasty's governor stationed in the Hanoi area at that time. The elder sister, Trung Trac, took the throne and called herself "Trung Vuong" (Trung Queen). Two years later, in 42 AD, Emperor Guangwu of the Chinese feudal Han dynasty sent Ma Yuan (Ma Fubo) to invade Vietnam, encountering the heroic resistance of Trung Trac and Trung Nhi. Later, in a fierce battle, Trung Trac and Trung Nhi were defeated due to being outnumbered and were forced to leave Me Linh, the capital not far from present-day Hanoi, and finally threw themselves into the river and committed suicide. Some say that the place where Trung Trac and Trung Nhi committed suicide was West Lake in the Hanoi city area today. That is a misunderstanding. In reality, the place where they committed suicide was the Day River (formerly known as the Hat River) to the west of Hanoi, while West Lake was the site of their final battle with the invading army.

    The spirit of Trung Trac and Trung Nhi, who resolutely resisted foreign aggression and sacrificed themselves to protect the country, is deeply admired by the Vietnamese people. After their deaths, the people automatically built a temple in Dong Nhan Village by the river to commemorate them. Later, fearing that it would be washed away by the river, it was moved to its current address. That was in 1819. This address was originally the martial temple and military training ground of the Le Dynasty of Vietnam, located in the southeast of Hanoi city.

    The Vietnamese people respectfully call the Trung Trac and Trung Nhi sisters "Trung Queen" and "Lady" of the Hat family. The temple is filled with incense. In the front center of the temple is a solemn tin-gold memorial tablet, flanked by two large tin elephants. The Trung Queen sisters rode elephants to resist Ma Yuan's invading army. Through the side pavilion doors, one enters the main hall, where huge statues of Trung Trac and Trung Nhi sit upright on the altar, flanked by many statues of female generals, majestic and kind, lifelike. Two bouquets of fresh flowers are placed in front of Trung Trac and Trung Nhi. These are no ordinary flowers, but flowers representing the lofty respect of 600 million Chinese people for the heroes of the Vietnamese people, flowers symbolizing peace and friendship.

    After Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal He Long presented flowers and paid their respects, they were guided on a tour by the female abbess of the temple. They learned in detail about the birth and death dates of the two Trung Queens, their heroic deeds, and the history of the temple.

    At the time of parting, the female abbess of the temple said that she was very grateful for Premier Zhou Enlai's visit, thanking him for bringing the profound friendship of the Chinese people, and that the two Trung Queens, if they were aware, would feel boundless comfort. The car slowly left the courtyard of the Two Trung Queens Temple, and the couplet on the stone archway in front of the courtyard was clearly visible: "Where is the copper pillar that marks the mountain now?" "The land stands at Long Bien and will never move!" Meaning that although the weapons used to resist the invading army are gone, Long Bien (in Hanoi, formerly called Long Bien or Sheng Long) remains the same, fully demonstrating the heroic spirit of the Vietnamese people.

    Those who have had contact with the Vietnamese people will feel that they are so warm, simple, tenacious, and hardworking, and at the same time very brave. To foreign aggressors, the Vietnamese people always "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

    From the Qin and Han dynasties to the Ming and Qing dynasties, the feudal dynasties of China invaded and enslaved Vietnam, and all these great power chauvinist aggressors ended in failure. "Hoan Kiem Lake" in the center of Hanoi is a witness to this history.

    It is said that Hoan Kiem Lake used to be a section of the Nhi River (Red River). Later, the Nhi River flowed north, and this section was separated by sediment and became a lake. At that time, the lake surface was twice as large as it is now, and there was a passage in the lake, one side of the passage called Left View Lake, and the other side called Right View Lake. Later, Right View Lake was gradually filled in, becoming the urban area around today's Drum Street, and Left View Lake was renamed to its current name in May 1430.

    There is an old legend in Vietnamese folklore: More than 500 years ago, a man named Le Loi dug up a precious sword in the earth, and from then on defeated the invading army of the Ming Dynasty of the Chinese feudal dynasty, and established an independent country. He became the emperor, known as Le Thai To. One day, just as Le Loi and his close ministers were taking a boat trip on the lake, they suddenly saw a giant turtle emerge from the water, swimming towards the boat. He hurriedly drew his sword, preparing to strike forward, but the sword was bitten by the turtle and sank to the bottom of the water. This is the origin of the name Hoan Kiem Lake (Lake of the Returned Sword).

    Today, there are still historical sites such as Turtle Tower, Ngoc Son Temple, and Tran Ba Pavilion on Hoan Kiem Lake. Ngoc Son Temple houses the statues of Vietnamese national heroes such as Tran Quoc Tuan who resisted the invading army of the Yuan Dynasty.

    Premier Zhou Enlai and others visited these historical sites one by one with respect.

    In the past century, the Vietnamese people have carried out heroic struggles against the invading French colonialists, and countless heroes and martyrs have fought one after another for the independence and liberation of their motherland. Especially since 1930, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and its predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, have bravely advanced on the revolutionary road of national liberation and democracy. In 1945, they achieved the historically significant victory of the "August Revolution" and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In 1954, they achieved a decisive victory against the armed aggression of French imperialism, restored peace in Indochina, and liberated the northern part of their motherland. The Vietnamese people are working hard to consolidate the North and strive for the unification of the North and South.

    The Vietnamese people's struggle for independence and freedom has always been sincerely supported by the Chinese people. This support became a powerful moral and material force after the Chinese Communist Party established the People's Republic of China.

    From Chairman Mao Zedong's instruction to change "Zhennanguan" (Gate of Suppressing the South) on the Sino-Vietnamese border to "Munanguan" (Gate of Friendship with the South) to Premier Zhou Enlai laying flowers in front of the statue of a Vietnamese female national hero, one can see that China's great modern statesmen are using sincere friendship to repay the debts owed by the great power chauvinist aggressors of past dynasties.

    Premier Zhou Enlai and others left the hospitable capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam this morning. When his silver plane circled the airport once, leaving the cheering crowds behind and flying south, he took with him the affection of the brave, hardworking, and simple Vietnamese people. However, he also left behind the sincere friendship of 600 million Chinese people for 25 million Vietnamese people forever: in the hearts of the people of Hanoi, in the shimmering waves of Hoan Kiem Lake, and also on the stone archway of the Two Trung Queens Temple.

    红河畔的友谊
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    “河内二征王庙”里香烟缭绕、钟声回荡。
    周恩来总理和副总理贺龙元帅在他们访问越南的四天中，特地抽空来到正殿前面，向越南两位女民族英雄征侧和征贰致敬献花。
    征侧、征贰是亲姊妹俩，在一千九百多年前，即公元四十年的时候，率领群众起义，把当时中国王朝派驻河内一带的太守苏定赶走了。大姐征侧就位，号称“征王”。两年后，即公元四十二年，中国封建王朝汉光武帝派马援（马伏波）举兵侵略越南，遭到征侧、征贰的英勇抗拒。后来在一场激战中，征侧、征贰因为寡不敌众而失败，被迫离开距今日河内不远的迷灵京都，最后终于投江自尽了。有人说，征侧、征贰自尽的地方就在今日河内市区里的西湖。那是误会。实际上，他们自尽的地方是在河内西面的底江（过去叫核江），而西湖却是他们和侵略军最后决战之地。
    征侧、征贰那种坚决反抗外国侵略和舍身保国的精神，深深地得到越南人民的敬仰。他们死后，人民便自动在临江的东仁村修建了一座庙宇，以作纪念。后来，因为怕被江水冲刷，便搬到现在地址。那是1819年的事，这地址原来是越南黎朝时的武庙和演武场，位置在河内市区的东南部。
    越南人民都尊称征侧、征贰姊妹为“征王”褐氏“娘娘”。这个庙里香火很盛。庙的前面正中是庄严的锡金牌位，两旁立着两只大锡象。征王两姊妹就是骑着大象抗拒马援的侵略军队的。通过两旁的阁门入内是正殿，征侧、征贰巨大塑像端正坐在神台上，两旁并列着许多女将的塑像，威武慈祥，栩栩如生。两束鲜花摆在征侧、征贰的面前，这不是平常的花，这是代表六亿中国人民对于越南人民英雄崇高敬意的花，这是象征着和平和友谊的花。
    周恩来总理和贺龙元帅献花致敬之后，由庙中的女住持引导巡礼。他们详细地了解了二征王的生死年月，英雄事迹以及庙宇的历史。
    在告别的时候，庙中的女住持说，她非常感激周恩来总理的来访，感谢他带来了中国人民的盛情厚意，二征娘娘有知，将会感到无限宽慰。汽车徐徐地离开二征王庙的庭院，院前石牌坊上的那副对联清晰入目：“山标铜柱今何在？”“地峙龙边迄不移！”意思是说当年抗拒侵略军的武器虽然不在了，二龙边（在河内，过去曾叫龙边或生龙）依然如故，这充分显示了越南人民的英雄气概。
    有过交往的人都会感到越南人民是那么的热情、纯朴、坚韧、勤劳，同时又非常的英勇。对于外来的侵略者，越南人民总是“以眼还眼，以牙还牙”的。
    从秦、汉一直到明、清，中国历代的封建王朝都侵略和奴役过越南，而所有这些大国主义侵略者都以失败告终。河内市中心的“还剑湖”，正是这种历史的见证人。
    据说，还剑湖过去是珥河（红河）的一段，后来，珥河向北流，这段便被泥沙隔离而变成湖泊。当时湖面比现在大两倍，湖中有一条通道，道的一边叫左望湖，另一边叫右望湖。后来右望湖逐渐填平，成为今日鼓行街一带的市区，左望湖到1430年5月才改成现在的名字。
    在越南民间有一个古老的传说：五百多年前，有一个名叫黎利的，在土中挖出一支宝剑，从此击败了中国封建王朝明朝的侵略军，建立了独立的国家，他当了皇帝，号称为黎太祖。有一天，正当黎利和近臣乘船游湖的时候，忽然看见一只巨大的乌龟浮出水面，迎着船身游过来，他就慌忙拔出宝剑，正预备前击，宝剑却被乌龟一口咁住，沉到水底里去了。这是还剑湖得名的由来。
    现在，在还剑湖上还有龟塔、玉山寺和镇波亭等古迹。玉山寺里供有抗拒元朝侵略军的陈国骏等越南民族英雄像。
    周恩来总理等怀着敬意逐一参观了这些古迹。
    在近一个世纪以来，越南人民进行了反对法国殖民主义侵略者的英勇斗争，无数的英雄烈士前仆后继地为自己祖国的独立解放而奋斗。特别是1930年以来，越南人民更在越南劳动党和它的前身印度支那共产党的领导下，在民族、民主的革命大道上奋勇前进，1945年取得了具有历史意义的“八月革命”的胜利，建立了越南民主共和国，1954年又取得了反对法帝国主义武装侵略的决定性胜利，恢复了印度支那的和平，解放了自己祖国的北方。越南人民正在为巩固北方、争取北部和南部的统一而努力。
    越南人民争取独立和自由的斗争一直得到中国人民的衷心支持。这种支持在中国共产党建立了中华人民共和国以后更成为一种强大的道义和物质上的力量。
    从毛泽东主席指示将中越边境上的“镇南关”改为“睦南关”到周恩来总理前往越南女民族英雄的像前献花，都可以看到中国现代的伟大政治家在以诚挚的友谊来偿还历代王朝大国主义侵略者所欠下的债务。
    周恩来总理等已经在今天上午离开了好客的越南民主共和国的首都了。当他的银色飞机绕机场上空一周，把欢送的人群留在后面而向南飞去的时候，他带去了勇敢、勤劳和纯朴的越南人民的情谊，但是，他也把六亿中国人民对二千五百万越南人民的诚挚友谊永远留下：留在河内人的心中，留在还剑湖的波光里，也留在二征王庙的石坊上。
