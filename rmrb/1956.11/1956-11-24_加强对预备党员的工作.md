Strengthening Work with Probationary Party Members
He Zhuo

The new Party Constitution passed by the Eighth National Congress of the Party stipulates that applicants for Party membership must undergo a one-year probationary period after approval before they can be transferred to full membership. It also stipulates: "During the probationary period of probationary party members, the Party organization should conduct preliminary Party education for probationary party members and conduct inspections of the political qualities of probationary party members. The obligations of probationary party members are the same as those of full party members. The rights of probationary party members, except for the lack of the right to elect, be elected, and vote, are also the same as those of full party members." The new Party Constitution's provisions for probationary party members and the probationary period are of great significance for improving the quality of the Party.

The Party conducts strict inspections of every applicant for Party membership; the Party conducts strict supervision and frequent education of every Party member. Given this, what is the special significance of requiring new Party members to undergo a one-year probationary period? The significance is great. Before a person joins the Party, although the Party has already conducted many inspections and understandings of him and carried out necessary education, before a person joins the Party, the Party can only examine his level of awareness based on his understanding of the Party and his performance in general work and social activities. Although the Party can conduct Party education for him, it cannot, after all, make demands on him that are the same as those made on Party members. Before joining the Party, a person can express that he recognizes the Party Program and the Party Constitution, is willing to participate in a Party organization, accept the Party's tasks, and implement the Party's resolutions. However, whether he can actually fulfill these obligations in practical actions cannot be completely determined before joining the Party. Especially when our Party occupies a leading position in the country, it is inevitable that some opportunists will regard joining the Communist Party as a means of pursuing personal fame and gain. These people may say very well before joining the Party, but they may not do very well after joining the Party. With the provision of a probationary period, it is possible not only to more effectively improve the level of awareness of probationary party members from the practice of Party life and to train their working abilities so that they reach the conditions that a formal Communist Party member must possess, but also to enable the Party to further understand the thinking, character, and awareness of probationary party members. Through the actual training of Party life, the Party can observe whether the probationary party member is loyal to the Party, whether he can carry out irreconcilable struggles to safeguard the interests of the Party, whether he has the courage to conduct criticism and self-criticism, and whether he has the fine qualities of caring for and connecting with the masses... Through these inspections, the Party can have more sufficient grounds to decide whether the probationary party member can be transferred to full membership, or whether to extend their probationary period to continue to inspect and educate them, or to cancel their probationary party member status. If these inspection and education work are carried out after they become full party members, it will easily allow some people who have not yet fully possessed the conditions of a Communist Party member, or even some people who should not stay in the Party, to obtain the title of Communist Party member, which is detrimental to improving the quality of the Party.

In the past, the Party Constitution also stipulated different probationary periods (formerly called candidacy periods) based on the different social components of the applicants for Party membership. Many Party organizations, in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution, conscientiously inspected and educated probationary party members. In this regard, there are some good practices worth promoting. For example, regularly giving Party lectures to probationary party members to educate them on Party knowledge; assigning a special person (the probationary party member's introducer or someone with whom he has more working relationships) to conduct individual education for the probationary party member; assigning Party work and social work tasks to probationary party members; and enabling them to receive training from these activities and their daily work to inspect their level of awareness and ideological qualities; stipulating that probationary party members regularly report their ideological situation to the branch or group so that the branch or group can help them overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes in a timely manner, and at the same time point out the direction of their efforts. The urban truck branch of the Hangzhou City Moving Company took these measures to strengthen the inspection and education of probationary party members and achieved good results. In 1956, thirty-seven of the thirty-nine probationary party members in their branch were transferred to full membership on schedule. The branch also made appropriate arrangements for the other two probationary party members. After many Party organizations strengthened the inspection and education of probationary party members, they not only helped the majority of probationary party members improve their level of awareness, but also discovered a small number of probationary party members whose level of awareness was too low and needed to have their probationary period extended or their probationary party member status revoked, and cleared out individual opportunists and bad elements who had infiltrated the Party, ensuring the quality and purity of the Party.

At the same time, it must also be pointed out that in the past, many Party organizations did not properly inspect and educate probationary party members, and even refused to discuss their transfer to full membership on schedule. Or because of the lack of inspection and education in peacetime, the Party organization was unable to deal with their transfer to full membership in a timely manner when the probationary period expired due to a lack of understanding of the situation. For example, the Organization Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted a survey in March of this year. At that time, there were a total of 17,854 probationary party members in the province, of which 14,907 had expired but had not completed the transfer procedures, accounting for 84% of the probationary party members. Similar situations have been found in other provinces and cities. In some places, it was even discovered that the probationary period of probationary party members had been delayed for three or four years. This situation cannot be said to be serious. Some probationary party members who have long possessed the conditions of full party members cannot be transferred to full party membership in a timely manner; some probationary party members whose level of awareness is not high enough, or who have some shortcomings in their ideological qualities, have not received the Party's effective assistance and education during the probationary period and cannot quickly correct their shortcomings and improve themselves. These are all very unfavorable to giving play to the enthusiasm of probationary party members and enhancing the Party's combat effectiveness. At the same time, due to the lack of inspection and education, it may also allow a small number of people who do not yet meet the conditions for Party membership to be transferred to full Party membership, so that individual opportunists and bad elements can infiltrate the Party.

Why is there a phenomenon of neglecting the inspection and education of probationary party members in some Party organizations? This is because many Party workers believe that as long as a certain number of probationary party members are absorbed, the task of developing new Party members is completed. They do not know that probationary party members are not yet full party members, and that the work of probationary party members is an integral part of the entire work of developing new Party members; absorbing a large number of probationary party members without working with them and discussing their transfer to full membership on time means that the task of developing new Party members has not been completed. Some Party workers also believe that whether a probationary party member can be transferred to full membership on schedule mainly depends on his personal efforts, so they do not conduct inspection and education work on them. It is true that the speed of a person's progress is determined by personal efforts, but if a person is only allowed to explore on his own, and no one points out the direction, no one constantly provides guidance from the side, telling you what is right and what is wrong; when a person has shortcomings and mistakes, no one reminds him in time and helps him find ways to correct them, his progress will be very slow, and he may even take many detours. Therefore, when we emphasize that personal progress depends on personal efforts, we must never ignore the Party organization's assistance, education, and supervision, especially for probationary party members, because they are not yet mature in all aspects and have not yet undergone the training and testing of Party life.

Party organizations at all levels must, in accordance with the provisions of the new Party Constitution on the work of probationary party members, strengthen the education and inspection of probationary party members. During the probationary period of probationary party members, systematically conduct education on the basic knowledge of the Party and ideological education in a planned manner, so that they understand the rules of Party life, understand the Party's basic policies, and the obligations that Party members should fulfill; inspect their political qualities and actual class awareness from practical work; appropriately assign them to do Party work, so that they can truly receive the training of Party life during the one-year probationary period, increase their Party knowledge, improve their level of awareness, and reach the conditions that a Party member should possess. In the past, some Party branches believed that probationary party members had a low level and could not undertake Party work, and did not actively use them; other branches had excessive demands on them and did not distinguish them from full party members when assigning work, making their burden too heavy. This not only prevented them from receiving training, but also dampened their enthusiasm. Therefore, work must be assigned appropriately, and specific assistance should be provided to them. For those who still have problems in their political history, the investigation should be clarified during the probationary period and a conclusion should be made so that they can complete the transfer procedures on schedule.

    加强对预备党员的工作
    何卓
    党的第八次全国代表大会通过的新党章规定：申请入党的人经过批准后，必须经过一年的预备期，才能转为正式党员。同时规定：“在预备党员预备期间，党的组织应当向预备党员进行初步的党的教育，并且对于预备党员的政治品质进行考察。预备党员的义务同正式党员一样。预备党员的权利，除了没有选举权、被选举权和表决权以外，也同正式党员一样。”新党章对于预备党员和预备期的规定，对于提高党的质量有很大的意义。
    党对于每一个申请入党的人都要进行严格的考察；党对于每一个党员都要进行严格的监督和经常的教育。既然如此，新入党的人要经过一年的预备期，又有什么特殊意义呢？意义是很大的。一个人在入党前，党虽然已经对他作了很多考察了解，进行了必要的教育，但是，在一个人入党前，党还只能从他对党的认识、从他在一般工作和社会活动中的表现来考察他的觉悟程度。党虽然可以对他进行党的教育，毕竟不能对他提出和党员一样的要求。在入党前一个人可以表示他承认党纲和党章、愿意参加党的一个组织接受党的任务、执行党的决议，但是，在实际行动中他究竟能不能履行这些义务，就不是在入党前所能够完全肯定的。特别是当我们党在全国居于领导地位的时候，就难免有一些投机分子把加入共产党当做追逐个人名利的手段，这些人在入党前可以说得很好，在入党后就不一定做得很好。有了预备期的规定，就不但可以从党的生活的实践中更有效地提高预备党员的觉悟水平，锻炼他们的工作能力，使他们达到一个正式共产党员所必须具备的条件，而且可以使党更进一步了解预备党员的思想、品质和觉悟水平，在党的生活的实际锻炼中，考察预备党员对党是不是忠诚，能不能为维护党的利益而进行不调和的斗争，有没有勇气进行批评和自我批评，有没有关心群众联系群众的优良品质……。通过这些考察，党就可以有更充分的根据来决定预备党员是不是可以转为正式党员、或者是延长他们的预备期，继续对他们进行考察教育，或者取消他们的预备党员资格。如果这些考察教育工作等到他们成为正式党员的时候才进行，就容易让一些还没有完全具备共产党员条件，甚至一些不应该留在党内的人取得共产党员的称号，这对于提高党的质量是有妨害的。
    过去的党章也根据入党者不同的社会成分，分别规定了不同时间的预备期（过去叫候补期）。许多党组织遵照党章的规定，对预备党员认真地进行了考察和教育。在这方面还有着一些值得推行的好作法。比如，定期给预备党员上党课，进行党的知识的教育；指定专人（预备党员的介绍人或者和他工作关系较多的人）对预备党员进行个别教育；分配给预备党员党的工作和社会工作的任务；从这些活动以及他们的日常工作中，使他们受到锻炼，考察他们的觉悟程度和思想品质；规定预备党员定期向支部或小组汇报自己的思想情况，以便支部或小组帮助他们及时克服缺点纠正错误，同时给他们指出努力的方向。中共杭州市搬运公司市区货车支部就是采取了这些措施，加强了对预备党员的考察教育工作，取得了很好的成绩。1956年，他们支部的三十九名预备党员中有三十七名按期转为正式党员。对另外二名预备党员支部也作了适当处理。许多党组织在加强对预备党员的考察教育后，但不帮助大多数预备党员提高了觉悟程度，而且发现了少数觉悟程度太低需要延长预备期或者取消预备党员的资格，清除了个别混入党内的投机分子和坏分子，保证了党的质量和党的纯洁。
    同时也必须指出，过去，不少党组织并没有很好地对预备党员进行考察、教育，甚至不肯按规定的时间讨论他们的转正问题。或者是因为平时缺少考察教育，到了预备期满时，党组织因为不了解情况，而不能及时处理他们的转正问题，例如，中共浙江省委组织部在今年3月间曾做过一次调查，当时全省共有预备党员一万七千八百五十四人，其中预备期满而没有办理转正手续的就有一万四千九百零七人，占预备党员的84％。在其他省市也都发现有类似的情况。有些地方甚至发现有把预备党员的预备期拖延了三、四年之久的。这种情况不能不说是严重的。一些早已具备了正式党员条件的预备党员不能及时转为正式党员；一些觉悟程度还不够高，或者思想品质方面有着一些缺点的预备党员，在预备期间没有受到党的切实的帮助教育，不能迅速地改正缺点，提高自己，这些，对于发挥预备党员的积极性，增强党的战斗力都是很不利的。同时，由于疏于考察教育，还可能使少数还没有具备党员条件的转为正式党员，使个别投机分子、坏分子得以混入党内。
    为什么在有些党组织中存在着忽视对预备党员进行考察教育的现象呢？这是因为有不少党的工作人员认为，只要吸收了一定数量的预备党员就算完成了发展新党员的任务。他们不知道预备党员还不是正式党员，对预备党员的工作，是整个发展新党员工作的一个组成部分；吸收了大批的预备党员，而不对他们进行工作，不按时讨论他们的转正问题，就是没有完成发展新党员的任务。有些党的工作人员还认为预备党员能否按期转正，主要的是要靠他个人的努力，因而就不去对他们进行考察教育工作。不错，一个人进步的快慢，个人的努力是起决定作用的，但是，如果只让一个人独自摸索，没有人给指出方向，没有人经常的从旁给予指引，告诉你哪样做对，哪样做不对；当一个人有了缺点和错误的时候，没有人及时地提醒他并且帮助他寻求改正的办法，他的进步就会很慢，甚至要走不少弯路。因此，当我们强调个人的进步要靠个人的努力时，决不可忽视党组织的帮助、教育和监督作用，特别是对于预备党员，因为他们在各方面都还不成熟，还没有经过党的生活的锻炼和考验。
    各级党的组织，必须按照新党章对预备党员工作的规定，加强对预备党员的教育考察工作。在预备党员的预备期间对他们有计划地、有系统地进行党的基本知识的教育和思想教育，使他们懂得党的生活规则，懂得党的各项基本政策以及党员应该履行的义务；从实际工作中，考察他们的政治品质和实际的阶级觉悟；适当地分配他们做党的工作，使他们在一年的预备期间，能够真正地受到党内生活的锻炼，增长党的知识，提高觉悟程度，达到一个党员所应具备的条件。过去有些党的支部认为候补党员水平低，不能担负党的工作，而不积极地使用他们；也有的支部对他们要求过高，在分配工作时和正式党员不加区别，使他们负担过重，这样不但不能使他们受到锻炼，反而挫伤了他们的积极性，因此，分配工作必须恰当，而且应当对他们进行具体的帮助。对于那些在政治历史上还有问题的人，在预备期间要调查清楚，作出结论，使他们能够按期履行转正手续。
