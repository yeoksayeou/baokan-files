    Yellow River Reservoir Work Team Discovers Many Ancient Relics

    (Our newspaper dispatch) Since the working group of the Yellow River Reservoir Work Team, conducting archaeological excavations in the Hexingzhen near the riverbank construction area of Shan County, Henan, began its work in April of this year, it has made significant gains. The work has now come to a close. This time, more than 230 tombs from the Han, Sui, Tang, Song, and Jin dynasties were excavated, yielding many specimens. Among the most important is a measuring vessel named "Cuo" from the first year of Wang Mang's Shijianguo era. It is inscribed with a text recording the size and capacity of the vessel, and its format is the same as that of a "Xin Jia Liang" which was stolen to Taiwan by the bandit Chiang. In the Tang tombs, a copper ruler and two iron rulers were also discovered. Although many Tang rulers have been passed down, it is rare to have formal scientific records of them being excavated from tombs by archaeologists. These two discoveries provide important data for the study of the ancient system of measurement. Some porcelain unearthed from the Tang tombs is also an important gain. Some of the white porcelain, in particular, is very complete in terms of glaze, body, and shape, and is an important specimen in the study of ceramic history. In particular, two pieces of porcelain with kiln transmutation have a glaze and body very similar to the famous "Jun Kiln" porcelain of the Song dynasty. Further research on them will surely provide a newer understanding of how ancient people mastered copper-containing glaze transmutation. In addition, some Tang dynasty ornaments were also discovered. The diverse makeup styles sung by poets at the time can be exemplified by many physical objects from this discovery.

    黄河水库工作队发现许多古文物
    本报讯　在河南陕县会兴镇附近河滨新城建筑工程地区进行考古发掘工作的黄河水库工作队工作组，自今年4月开始工作以来获得了重要的收获。目前工作已告一段落。这一次共发掘了汉、隋、唐、宋、金等时代的墓葬二百三十余座，得到标本很多。其中最重要的为王莽始建国元年的名叫“撮”的量器，上面刻了一篇铭文，记载本器的体积大小和容量等，其格式和被蒋贼盗往台湾的一件“新嘉量”上的铭文相同。在唐墓中还发现了铜尺一根，铁尺二根，传世的唐尺虽然很多，但正式由考古工作者由墓中取出，有科学记录的还不多见。这两种发现，给研究古代度量制度，提供了重要的资料。唐墓中出土的一些瓷器，也是重要收获之一，如其中的一些白瓷，在釉色、胎骨、造型等方面都很完善，是陶瓷史研究中的重要标本。特别是有窑变的两件瓷器，釉色和胎骨，都酷似宋代的名瓷“均窑”。将来在对它们作进一步的研究后，对古代人们掌握含铜釉窑变的情况，一定会有更新的认识。此外还发现了一些唐代的装饰品，当时诗人所咏述的变化多采的化妆样式，从这次发现中可以得到许多实物的例证。
