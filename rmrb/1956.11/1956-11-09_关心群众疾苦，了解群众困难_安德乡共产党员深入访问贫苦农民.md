    Showing Concern for the Masses' Hardships and Understanding Their Difficulties:
    Communist Party Members in Ande Township Conduct In-Depth Visits to Poor Farmers
    Xinhua News Agency: The Communist Party branch in Ande Township, Chongning County, Sichuan Province, is a branch that pays attention to the hardships of the masses. Recently, more than 100 Communist Party members from this branch visited 105 poor farming households in the township to understand their difficulties in getting through the winter.
    During their visits, the Communist Party members discovered that although these farming households had joined agricultural production cooperatives, their lives were still relatively difficult. Among them, 51 households lacked cotton-padded coats and quilts, the houses of 14 households were too dilapidated to keep out the winter cold, two households had family members who were sick but had no money for medical treatment, and 15 farming households had no money to buy pigs to raise in the winter.
    Based on the reports from the Party members, the Communist Party branch in Ande Township consulted with the 30 agricultural cooperatives in each village. The cooperatives allocated 510 yuan from the public welfare fund to sew cotton-padded coats and quilts for poor cooperative members and invited doctors to treat the sick cooperative members. A portion of bamboo and grain stalks were also allocated, and the Communist Party members took the lead in mobilizing cooperative members to build and repair houses for poor cooperative members free of charge. In addition, the Communist Party branch in Ande Township suggested that the township credit cooperative issue loans of 250 yuan to poor cooperative members for buying pigs and repairing pigsties. Now, these poor farmers can get through the winter.
    The actions of the Communist Party members in Ande Township in visiting and concretely helping the poor farming masses to solve their difficulties were carried out after studying the documents of the First Party Congress of Sichuan Province. This action was supported and loved by the people of the entire township. Luo Fangshi, a widowed and elderly member of the Second Agricultural Cooperative in Village One of the township, who is old and deaf and has difficulties in life, had been using a tattered mosquito net as a quilt for a long time. Communist Party member Zhang Zhengqing recently helped her receive 10 yuan from the public welfare fund and personally went to the market to buy cloth and cotton wadding and made a cotton quilt to send to her. Luo Fangshi tightly grasped Zhang Zhengqing's hand, too moved to speak.

    关心群众疾苦，了解群众困难
    安德乡共产党员深入访问贫苦农民
    新华社讯　中共四川省崇宁县安德乡支部是一个注意关心群众疾苦的支部。最近这个支部的一百多名共产党员，分头访问了本乡一百零五户贫苦农民，了解他们过冬的困难。
    共产党员们在访问中发现：这些农户虽然都已加入农业生产合作社，但生活仍旧比较困难，其中有五十一户缺少棉袄和被盖，有十四户人的房子太破烂，遮不住冬天的风寒，有两户家里有病人无钱医治，有十五户农民冬天没有钱买猪养。
    中共安德乡支部根据党员的汇报，同各村三十个农业社商量，由各社从公益金里拨出五百一十元给贫苦社员缝制棉袄和被盖，为害病的社员请医生诊治。又拨出一部分竹料和谷草，由共产党员们带头发动社员免费为贫苦社员新盖和修补房屋。此外，中共安德乡支部又建议乡信用合作社发放贷款二百五十元，给贫苦社员作买猪和修猪圈之用。现在，这些贫苦农民都可以渡过冬天了。
    安德乡共产党员访问和具体帮助贫苦农民群众解决困难，是在学习了中共四川省第一次党代表大会文件以后进行的。这种行动受到了全乡人民的拥护和爱戴。这个乡一村第二农业社孤寡社员罗方氏，年老耳聋，生活困难，很久以来都是用一床烂蚊帐当被子盖。共产党员张正清最近帮她领来十元公益金，还亲自到街上买布和棉絮，做成棉被给她送去。罗方氏紧紧抓住张正清的手，感动得连话也说不出来。
