Imperialist Subversion Activities Against Hungary
　　Zhang Ye

Numerous facts prove that the recent counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary were the result of long-term subversion activities carried out by imperialist countries against Hungary, which they then seized as an opportunity to instigate.

	Making subversion a policy

For a long time, imperialist countries, especially certain ruling groups in the United States, have regarded subversion against the legitimate governments of socialist countries as a policy they pursue.

On October 10, 1951, the U.S. Congress passed the so-called "Mutual Security Act," openly deciding to allocate one hundred million U.S. dollars to carry out subversion activities against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

Three days after the passage of this bill, then-U.S. President Truman met with a 20-member delegation from the "Federation of Hungarian Americans" at the White House and stated: "What we need is for all nations of the world to enjoy the same personal freedom that we do. After the Yalta and Potsdam conferences, we hoped that Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland would see this situation. Unfortunately, the situation has not changed in this way. We must now further struggle to continue to create the same freedoms in oppressed countries that we enjoy in the United States..." (October 13, 1951, New York radio broadcast) Translated into ordinary language, this means: the United States hates the governments chosen by the people of Eastern European People's Democratic countries, and it is determined to overthrow these governments.

Eisenhower also made subversion of socialist countries one of his campaign platforms during his first run for president. On August 25, 1952, in a speech to the National Convention of the American Legion, he shamelessly listed the names of the countries he wanted to "liberate," including Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, the German Democratic Republic, and three Soviet republics—Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. On December 25 last year, Eisenhower issued a so-called "Christmas message" to the people of Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and other countries, and even stated that the United States supported the violent overthrow of the political systems established in these countries.

On April 16 this year, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a provocative resolution, openly clamoring for the "liberation" of the Eastern European People's Democratic countries. In July, the U.S. Senate decided to allocate an additional $25 million as a "special fund" to strengthen subversion activities against socialist countries. It is worth noting that during this U.S. election, the platforms of the two major U.S. parties (Republican and Democratic) also stated that they intended to continue to interfere in the internal affairs of People's Democratic countries, with the aim of restoring the capitalist system in these countries.

	Collecting and keeping social scum to carry out subversion activities

Imperialist countries have always been the lairs of Hungarian traitors, fascists, and other reactionaries. The brutal fascist dictator Horthy fled to Germany after Soviet troops entered Hungary in 1944, and later went into exile in Portugal. Horthy elements and members of Hungary's fascist party, the Nyilas (Arrow Cross Party), have been entrenched in West Germany and Austria after their defeat, relying on imperialist funding to carry out activities. Ferenc Nagy, a national traitor who participated in the "Hungarian Association," an underground organization of American and British spy agencies that manufactured coups in an attempt to restore fascist rule in Hungary, went into hiding in the United States after the conspiracy failed, and continued to engage in conspiracies under the patronage and support of the United States.

The U.S. government openly supports reactionary organizations such as the "Federation of Hungarian Americans," led by Hungarian fascists, and the "American Hungarian National Council," organized by Hungarian national traitors such as Bela Varga.

The activities of U.S. intelligence organizations in Austria are also mainly aimed at the Eastern European People's Democratic countries. Under the protection of the U.S. consulate in Austria, many branches bearing the sign of "American Liaison Office for Exiles" have been established. The Austrian newspaper "Volksstimme" reported: "The road of the so-called American Liaison Office for Exiles does not lead to Canada or the United States, but sends people to spy training classes in Bavaria, where they undergo short-term training in demolition and radio receivers, and then are sent to neighboring People's Democratic countries."

The U.S. government once supported the organization of military forces in the American-occupied zones of Germany and Austria by fascist Major General Szakó, the leader of the "counter-espionage organization" of the Nyilas. The United States also established a so-called "special force" of the "Liberation Army," composed of Hungarian war criminals and fascists, within the regular U.S. Army. These troops are trained at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, and their mission is to be sent to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries to carry out subversion activities.

Imperialist countries are constantly sending the reactionary elements and specially trained secret agents they keep and harbor to Hungary to carry out subversion activities. In the first half of this year alone, the People's Republic of Hungary arrested forty agents sent by imperialism.

	Systematically directing reactionary propaganda activities

According to Australian journalist Gordon Stewart's exposure in his book "Dollars and Spies," the so-called "National Committee for a Free Europe," organized in 1949 by a group of prominent U.S. citizens, is actually a special agency engaged in subverting People's Democratic countries. Its activities are multifaceted: it established a "Central European Research Institute" specializing in collecting intelligence from various People's Democratic countries; established a "Liaison Department" engaged in collecting exiled reactionary elements; and organized a national committee of the so-called Hungarian government-in-exile. Hungarian national traitor Ferenc Nagy has close ties with this committee. Another major activity of the "Free Europe Committee" is the establishment of a "Free Europe" radio station in Munich, West Germany, which specializes in reactionary propaganda against Hungary and other Eastern European People's Democratic countries. In addition, the "Free Europe" radio station is constantly broadcasting American balloons carrying defamatory propaganda and aerial photography reconnaissance equipment to the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries. From February 8 to July 28, 1956, a total of two hundred and ninety-three American balloons flew into Hungarian airspace.

	Planning and organizing subversion activities

In several treason cases that have occurred since the establishment of the People's Republic of Hungary, there has been ample evidence that they were planned and organized by imperialist countries.

The conspiracy discovered in January 1947 to violently overthrow the Republic and restore the Horthy dictatorship, after investigation, proved to have been launched by then-Prime Minister Ferenc Nagy relying on the United States and Britain.

The treason case of Cardinal Mindszenty, exposed in 1948, was directly directed by the U.S. Minister to Budapest, Chapin. After Mindszenty's conspiracy failed, U.S. agent Colonel Vogeler, with the help of British agent Sanders, organized sabotage activities in Hungary with the aim of paralyzing the Hungarian economy. According to the trial results, some personnel in the U.S. Embassy in Hungary were engaged in espionage and sabotage activities against Hungary. The treasonous activities of Archbishop Grösz, exposed in June 1951, were also directly directed by the U.S. Embassy in Budapest.

The recent counter-revolutionary rebellion further illustrates how rampant the imperialist subversion activities against Hungary have become.

According to the Associated Press, Bela Varga, the chairman of the so-called "American Hungarian National Council," a Hungarian reactionary element hiding in the United States, said at a press conference in New York on the day the Hungarian incident began (October 23) that two weeks earlier, when he was in Europe, he contacted Hungarian "underground activists" and received information from them about "the impending event." According to a Vienna newspaper, shortly before the outbreak of the Hungarian rebellion, a meeting of senior leaders of Hungarian reactionary elements headed by Ferenc Nagy was held in Munich. Ferenc Nagy told the participants that "the decisive day has arrived." He also said that he had recently returned from the United States, where their detailed plan had been agreed upon by the highest authorities in the United States. He and certain U.S. agencies had formulated a more detailed plan to transport weapons and personnel to Hungary. After the outbreak of the rebellion, Ferenc Nagy flew to Vienna on October 30 to carry out activities. Then, batches of counter-revolutionary elements crossed the Austro-Hungarian border from Austria to Hungary to participate in the rebellion.

Recently, the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government also discovered that Western Red Cross organizations, under the guise of "aid" to the Hungarian people, used hundreds of airplanes to transport "aid supplies" and "medicines" during the riots, some of which contained weapons, and among the personnel escorting these supplies were former fascist officers of the old Horthy army and gendarmerie who had lived in West Germany.

After the rebellion was suppressed, Horthy, the heinous enemy of the Hungarian people exiled abroad, personally requested Eisenhower, Eden, and Mollet to support the Hungarian rebels. On November 4, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Lodge, publicly announced that Cardinal Mindszenty, a Hungarian traitor who was released during the rebellion, had fled to the U.S. Embassy in Budapest for "refuge" after the failure of the rebellion.

All of this proves that the outbreak and expansion of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion were planned by imperialist countries after long-term preparation and seized as an opportunity, and they vainly attempted to use this despicable means to carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration in Hungary.

However, the power of the people is irresistible. The patriotic people of Hungary finally saw through the sinister faces of imperialism and reactionary elements and defeated the conspiracy of counter-revolutionary restoration. The imperialist countries' subversion activities against Hungary have once again ended in failure. (Attached picture)

    帝国主义国家对匈牙利的颠覆活动
    章叶
    许多事实证明，匈牙利最近发生的反革命暴乱，是帝国主义国家对匈牙利长期进行颠复活动和乘机策动的结果。
      把进行颠复活动当作一种政策
    长期以来，帝国主义国家，特别是美国的某些统治集团，就把对社会主义国家的合法政府进行颠复活动，作为他们所奉行的一种政策。
    1951年10月10日，美国国会通过所谓“共同安全法”，公然决定拨款一亿美元，用来对苏联和人民民主国家进行颠复活动。
    在这个法案通过后第三天，当时的美国总统杜鲁门就在白宫接见了“旅美匈牙利人联合会”的二十人代表团，并且发表谈话说：“我们需要的是全世界所有各民族都能享受我们一样的个人自由。雅尔达和波茨坦会议之后，我们希望匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰都会出现这种局面。不幸的，情势的变化却不是如此。我们现在要进一步奋斗，在被压迫的国家内继续创造像我们在美国所享受的同样的自由……”（1951年10月13日纽约电台广播）这段话翻译成普通人的话就是：美国仇恨东欧人民民主国家人民所选择的政府，它决心要推翻这些政府。
    艾森豪威尔在他第一次竞选总统的时候，也把颠复社会主义国家作为他的竞选纲领之一。1952年8月25日，他在美国退伍军人团全国代表大会发表的演说中，曾大言不惭地列举了他要“解放”的国家的名单，这些名单中就有匈牙利、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚、德意志民主共和国，还有苏联的三个加盟共和国——拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚和立陶宛。去年12月25日，艾森豪威尔又向匈牙利、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚等国人民发表所谓“圣诞贺词”，竟然表示美国支持用暴力推翻在这些国家中所建立的政治制度。
    今年4月16日，美国众议院曾通过一项挑衅性的决议，公开叫喊要“解放”东欧人民民主国家。7月间，美国参议院决定追加拨款两千五百万美元，作为加强对社会主义国家进行颠复活动的“特别基金”。值得注意的是，在这次美国大选中，美国两个主要政党（共和党和民主党）的竞选纲领也都表示，他们打算继续干涉人民民主国家的内政，目的是要在这些国家中恢复资本主义制度。
    搜罗和豢养社会渣滓进行颠复活动
    帝国主义国家一直就是匈牙利卖国贼、法西斯分子和其他反动分子的窝主。残暴的法西斯独裁者霍尔蒂在1944年苏联军队进入匈牙利后就逃到德国，后来流亡到葡萄牙。霍尔蒂分子和匈牙利的法西斯党尼拉什分子（即箭十字党）在失败后，就盘踞在西德和奥地利，靠着帝国主义的拨款进行活动。参加美英间谍机关地下组织“匈牙利协会”制造政变，企图在匈牙利恢复法西斯统治的民族叛徒费伦茨·纳吉，在阴谋失败后就潜居美国，并在美国的豢养和支持下继续进行阴谋活动。
    美国政府公开支持匈牙利法西斯分子所领导的“旅美匈牙利人联合会”和由匈牙利民族叛徒贝拉·瓦加尔等组织的“美国匈牙利民族委员会”等反动组织。
    美国特务组织在奥地利境内的活动，也主要是针对东欧人民民主国家的。在奥地利的美国领事馆的庇护下，设立了许许多多挂着“流亡者美国联络处”招牌的分支机构。奥地利报纸“奥地利人民之声报”曾报道说：“所谓流亡者美国联络处的道路既不是通向加拿大的，也不是通向美国的，而是把人送到巴伐利亚的间谍训练班，经过短期的爆破和无线电收音机的训练，然后派到邻近的人民民主国家去。”
    美国政府曾经支持尼拉什分子的“反间谍组织”首领法西斯少将萨科在德国和奥地利美占区内组织军事部队。美国并且在正规的美国陆军机构内，建立由匈牙利战犯、法西斯分子组成的所谓“解放军”的“特种部队”。这些部队是在美国北卡罗来那州的布拉哥堡进行训练的，它的任务就是准备派往苏联和人民民主国家进行颠复活动。
    帝国主义国家不断把他们豢养和窝藏的反动分子和受过特殊训练的特务间谍，派到匈牙利来进行颠复活动，光是在今年上半年内，匈牙利人民共和国就逮捕了四十个帝国主义派遣的特务。
      有计划地指挥反动宣传活动
    根据澳大利亚记者戈登·斯图尔特在他所写的“美元与间谍活动”一书揭露的，1949年，一群著名的美国公民组织的所谓“自由欧洲全国委员会”，实际上是一个从事颠复人民民主国家的特务机关。它的活动是多方面的：它设立了一个“中欧研究所”，专门搜集各人民民主国家的情报；设立了一个“联络部”，从事收罗流亡的反动分子；并且组织了所谓匈牙利流亡政府的全国委员会。匈牙利的民族叛徒费伦茨·纳吉就和这个委员会有密切关系。“自由欧洲委员会”的另一个主要活动，是在西德的慕尼黑设立了一个“自由欧洲”广播电台，专门从事反对匈牙利和其他东欧人民民主国家的反动宣传。此外，“自由欧洲”广播电台更不断地向苏联和各人民民主国家放送带有诬蔑性宣传品以及空中摄影侦察仪器的美国气球。从1956年2月8日到7月28日这一期间，共有二百九十三个美国气球飞入匈牙利领空。
          策划和组织颠复活动
    在匈牙利人民共和国成立以后所发生的几次叛国案件中，都有充分的证据证明是帝国主义国家策划和组织的。
    1947年1月发现的企图用暴力推翻共和国并恢复霍尔蒂独裁制度的阴谋，经过调查以后证明是当时的总理费伦茨·纳吉依靠美国和英国发动的。
    1948年揭发的红衣主教明曾蒂叛国案件，是由美国驻布达佩斯公使夏品直接指挥的。在明曾蒂阴谋失败以后，美国特务伏盖勒上校，得到了英国特务桑德斯的帮助，在匈牙利组织了目的是在于瘫痪匈牙利的经济的破坏活动。根据审判结果证明，美国驻匈牙利公使馆中有些人员从事反对匈牙利的间谍和破坏活动。1951年6月揭露的格洛兹大主教的叛国活动，也是美国驻布达佩斯公使馆直接指挥的。
    最近这次反革命叛乱，更加说明了帝国主义对匈牙利进行的颠复活动已发展到多么猖狂的地步。
    据美联社透露，躲在美国的匈牙利反动分子、所谓“美国匈牙利民族委员会”主席贝拉·瓦加尔，在匈牙利事件开始那一天（10月23日），就在纽约的记者招待会上说，两个星期以前当他在欧洲时，他和匈牙利的“地下活动者”取得联系，并且从他们那里得到了关于“即将来临的事件”的情报。另据维也纳报纸透露，在匈牙利叛乱开始以前不久，曾经在慕尼黑举行了以费伦茨·纳吉为首的匈牙利反动分子高级领导人的会议。费伦茨·纳吉向参加会议的人说，“决定的日子到来了”。他还说，他不久以前才从美国回来，他们的详细计划在美国曾经取得最高机关的协议，
  他曾经和美国的某些机关制定了运输武器和人员到匈牙利去的更详细的计划。叛乱爆发后，费伦茨·纳吉曾在10月30日飞到维也纳进行活动。接着就有一批一批的反革命分子从奥地利越过奥匈边境到匈牙利
  参加了叛乱。
    最近匈牙利工农革命政府还发现，西方国家的红十字会假借“援助”匈牙利人民的名义，在暴乱时曾用成百架的飞机运送“援助物资”和“药品”，其中竟夹带着武器，而在押送这些物资的人员当中，有一部分人就是从前居住在西德的旧霍尔蒂军
  队和宪兵队的法西斯军官。
      在暴乱被镇压后，流亡国外的匈牙利人民的凶恶敌人霍尔蒂，曾亲自请求艾森豪威尔、艾登和摩勒支持匈牙利叛乱分子。11月4日，美国驻联合国大使洛奇公开宣布，在暴乱中被释放的匈牙利卖国贼红衣主教明曾蒂，在暴乱失败后已逃到美国驻布达佩斯公使馆“避难”。
    所有这些，都证明匈牙利反革命暴乱的爆发和扩大是帝国主义国家经过长期准备而乘机策动的，他们妄想用这种卑鄙的手段在匈牙利实行反革命复辟。
    但是，人民的力量是不可抗拒的。匈牙利爱国人民终于识破了帝国主义和反动分子的凶恶面目，并且击败了反革命复辟的阴谋。帝国主义国家对匈牙利的颠复活动又一次以失败而告终。（附图片）
