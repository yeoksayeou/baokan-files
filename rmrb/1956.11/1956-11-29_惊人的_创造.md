Amazing "Creation"
    Ji Wan

    Yang Xuanqi is a painter and the captain of the youth shock brigade at construction site 204 of the Second Engineering Company of the Central-South Engineering Management Bureau. Since its establishment in November last year, this shock brigade has exceeded its production quota every month until February of this year. In early February of this year, they studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," criticized right-leaning conservative thought, and revised their original plan into a more advanced one. The "Construction Site Life," the newspaper of the Party Committee of the Central-South Engineering Management Bureau, reported on their plan and published an editorial promoting their experience in revising the plan. From then on, the name of Yang Xuanqi, the captain of the youth shock brigade, made a deep impression on the minds of certain leading personnel.

    In mid-February, the Central-South Engineering Management Bureau conducted a selection of advanced producers to comprehensively launch the advanced producer movement. This work was mainly carried out by the Bureau's Trade Union. At a meeting to review candidates for advanced producers, it was discovered that there were no candidates among the painters, so the issue of nominating supplementary candidates was considered. A more responsible comrade said, "Wasn't Yang Xuanqi praised in the newspaper for leading his youth shock brigade in revising the plan? We can consider including Yang Xuanqi in the list of candidates." The comrade in charge of the Bureau's Trade Union thought this was a good idea. Therefore, a decision was made at the meeting to instruct the Trade Union of the Second Company of Central-South to prepare the material on Yang Xuanqi's advanced deeds and submit it within three to five days. At the same time, Comrade Zhuang Derong was sent by the Bureau's Trade Union to urge the submission of the material. The Company's Trade Union accepted this task, and without conducting any research, immediately instructed the Party branch of Construction Site 204 in the name of the Company Party Committee to complete this task within a limited time. Seeing that the higher authorities were requesting it so urgently, the Party branch of the construction site didn't have time to consider bringing the matter to the branch committee for discussion. They only thought, "The higher authorities know Yang Xuanqi so well, but we haven't felt that he is an advanced producer. Aren't we being too bureaucratic!" The Party branch of the construction site was very worried that the higher authorities would criticize them for bureaucracy, so they immediately called Hu Xiuchuan, the chairman of the trade union, and asked him to complete this task and submit it on time, saying, "This material must be prepared well to win glory for our construction site!" Comrade Hu Xiuchuan slapped his chest and said, "No problem, I will personally prepare the material to ensure the Bureau is satisfied." However, Comrade Hu Xiuchuan had spoken boastfully; he didn't have any material in hand. What should he do? Comrade Hu Xiuchuan had a good solution. He personally went to the units where Yang Xuanqi had worked and other departments to collect all the materials related to Yang Xuanqi and his youth shock brigade. Then he sat alone in the office and began writing. Regarding these materials, regardless of whether they were based on facts, whether they belonged to the collective or to individuals, and even whether they were plans or results that had already been achieved, he tried his best to process them and attribute them to Yang Xuanqi personally, striving to make them vivid and specific.

    The first deed that Comrade Hu Xiuchuan "created" was to write that Yang Xuanqi had "created" the emulsion paint method, an advanced Soviet experience that Hu Dehou and Zhu Dasheng had promoted in their team. He felt that this was very appropriate: Yang Xuanqi was the captain of the youth shock brigade, and the team members' promotion of advanced experience could not be unrelated to his leadership. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to write it on Yang Xuanqi's account. At the same time, promotion wasn't just copying; there was an experimental process. The experiment had a creative component, so writing it as "creation" would be more convincing, wouldn't it? Then, Comrade Hu Xiuchuan "created" the second deed – the suggestion to use large paintbrushes as advanced tools. This suggestion was originally proposed by Chen Changping and Cao Jingchun, and Yang Xuanqi played a certain role in promoting it. Therefore, Comrade Hu Xiuchuan had even more "reason" to write it as "Yang Xuanqi created the large paintbrush, increasing work efficiency by so much." Comrade Hu Xiuchuan didn't put much effort into creating the third deed either. Replacing paint with putty was originally a suggestion made by Yang Xuanqi, but after testing, it couldn't guarantee the quality of the project, so the Company's Rationalization Proposal Committee only agreed to use it on some interior projects, not comprehensively promoted. At the same time, the "70% cost reduction" mentioned in the suggestion was just an estimated figure. However, Comrade Hu Xiuchuan transformed this material, saying that this suggestion could reduce costs by 70% and was being comprehensively promoted. The "creation" work went very smoothly. So Comrade Hu Xiuchuan created the fourth, fifth... model worker deeds. Thus, Comrade Hu Xiuchuan completed the task on time!

    After receiving this material from Comrade Hu Xiuchuan, the Party branch of the construction site did not have anyone review it, did not discuss it at the branch committee, did not discuss it with the masses, and did not even tell Yang Xuanqi about it before hurriedly submitting the material to the Company.

    The Company's Trade Union handed over this material to Comrade Zhuang Derong, who was sent here by the Bureau's Trade Union to specifically urge the submission of material. Comrade Zhuang Derong said, "The company leader has to look at it. I need to stamp it before I can accept it. That's the Bureau's rule." The chairman of the Company's Trade Union said, "I won't look at it. It's okay for Comrade Tang Dayu (a cadre of the Company's Trade Union) to stamp it!" The Company's Trade Union stamped it, and Comrade Zhuang Derong took the material to the Bureau. Seeing that this material had been stamped by the Company, the Bureau's Trade Union naturally trusted it very much. Therefore, after the approval meeting, it was decided that Yang Xuanqi would be a Grade A advanced producer of the Central-South Engineering Management Bureau, attended the Bureau's advanced producer representative meeting, and received material rewards.

    Seeing this situation, the Youth League Committee of the Central-South Engineering Management Bureau reported Yang Xuanqi's model deeds to the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, requesting that the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League award Yang Xuanqi the title of "Youth Shock Worker." Later, the Central-South Engineering Management Bureau sent Yang Xuanqi to attend the National Building Industry Advanced Producer Representative Conference and selected Yang Xuanqi as a representative to the Second Congress of the Communist Party of Wuhan and the First Congress of the Communist Party of Hubei Province. From then on, Yang Xuanqi's name spread throughout the Wuhan area like "a thunderclap from flat ground, with three levels of waves at the Dragon Gate."

    However, the members of Yang Xuanqi's youth shock brigade were not very satisfied. Once, the Second Engineering Company of the Central-South Engineering Management Bureau held an advanced experience exhibition. Yang Xuanqi and his youth shock brigade members Xie Xiuan and others went to visit together. The team members found that the material at the exhibition read "Creator of Emulsion Paint Method, Yang Xuanqi." Immediately, someone questioned Yang Xuanqi face to face about what this was all about. Yang Xuanqi ignored them. The team members became even more dissatisfied. At a Party branch meeting at the construction site, someone exposed the fact that Yang Xuanqi had seized other people's honor. However, the person in charge of the construction site branch believed that this was an attack on Yang Xuanqi. To find out the truth, the team members wrote written materials to the Supervisory Committee of the Party Committee of the Central-South Engineering Management Bureau to file a complaint. The Supervisory Committee of the Party Committee of the Bureau then sent people to investigate and proved that Yang Xuanqi's model worker status was indeed "created."

    Now, who is responsible for this matter? The Bureau's Trade Union believes that the Bureau trusted the Company, and since the Company stamped it, it should be responsible. The Company believes that the Bureau asked for the material, so we had to ask the lower levels to collect it. As for determining what kind of advanced producer Yang Xuanqi was, what does that have to do with us? The Bureau's Youth League Committee believes that our request to the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League to award Yang Xuanqi the title of Youth Shock Worker was based on the material of the Bureau's Trade Union's selection as a Grade A advanced producer. Who knew that the Bureau's Trade Union's material was unreliable? The construction site believes that we are responsible for the discrepancies in the material, but we cannot bear the main responsibility, because the Bureau and the Company urged us so urgently, how could we have had time to verify the facts?

    Each has their own logic, who is right? Smart readers! You be the judge.

    惊人的“创造”
    季万
    杨宣起是中南工程管理总局第二工程公司二○四工地的油漆工、青年突击队队长。这个突击队从去年11月建队以来，到今年2月，月月超过定额完成生产计划。今年2月初旬，他们学习了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，批判了右倾保守思想，把原来订的规划修订为比较先进的规划。中南工程管理总局党委机关报——“工地生活”报道了他们的规划，并发表了社论，推广他们修订规划的经验。从此，青年突击队长杨宣起的名字在某些领导人员的脑海中有了较深刻的印象。
    2月中旬，中南工程管理总局为全面开展先进生产者运动，进行评选先进生产者的工作。这个工作是以局工会为主来进行的。在一次审查先进生产者候选人的会议上，发觉油漆工人中没有候选人，就考虑提补充候选人的问题。有一位比较负责的同志说：“杨宣起领导他的青年突击队修订规划，不是曾受到报纸表扬吗？可考虑杨宣起列入候选人名单中。”局工会负责同志认为很对，于是，会上作了决定，责成中南二公司工会整理杨宣起的先进事迹材料，限三、五天内上报；同时，局工会又派去庄德荣同志专门在那里催等材料。公司工会接受了这个任务，未作研究，立即用公司党委名义责成二○四工地党支部限期完成这个突击任务。工地党支部看见上级要求这样急，也就来不及考虑把这件事情提到支部委员会上讨论，只想到：“上级对杨宣起了解得如此清楚，我们还没感到他是一个先进生产者，未免太官僚了吧！”工地党支部很担心上级批评他们官僚主义，便马上把工会主席胡秀川找来，要他完成这个任务，如期上报，并说：“这个材料要整理得好些，为我们工地争光！”胡秀川同志胸口一拍说：“没问题，我亲自动手整理材料，保证叫局里满意。”可是，胡秀川同志说了大话，手中一点材料也没有，怎么办呢？胡秀川同志很有办法，他亲自到杨宣起曾经工作过的单位及其他部门，把有关杨宣起和他的青年突击队的材料统统搜罗回来，就独自一人静坐办公室里编写起来。对于这些材料，不管它有无根据，不管它是集体的还是个人的，更不管它是计划还是已经取得效果的，都尽可能的经过加工放在杨宣起个人身上，并且力求生动具体些。
    胡秀川同志首先“创造”出来的事迹是把他们队里的胡德厚和祝大胜推广的苏联先进经验——乳剂油漆法写成是杨宣起“创造”的。他觉得这样很合适：杨宣起是青年突击队长，队员推广先进经验，不能与他的领导无关，写在杨宣起账上，也不为过分。同时，推广不是硬搬过来，有一个试验过程，试验中就有创造成分，写为“创造”，不是更有说服力吗？接着胡秀川同志“创造”第二件事迹——使用大排笔先进工具的建议。这个建议，原是陈长平和曹景春二人提出的，杨宣起在推广中起了一定作用。于是胡秀川同志就更有“理由”的把它写成“杨宣起创造了大排笔，提高工效多少多少”了。第三件事迹的创造，胡秀川同志也没有费多大劲。油灰代替油漆，本是杨宣起提的建议，但在试验后因它不能保证工程质量，公司合理化建议委员会鉴定只同意在部分室内工程上使用，没有全面推广。同时，建议中所说的“可降低成本70％”，也只是一个估计数字。可是，胡秀川同志把这份材料摇身一变，说这个建议可以降低成本70％，全面推广起来了。“创造”工作很顺利。于是胡秀川同志创造了第四件，第五件……劳模事迹。于是胡秀川同志如期完成突击任务！
    工地党支部收到胡秀川同志的这份材料后，没有人过目，也没有在支部委员会上研究和通过群众讨论，也没有告诉杨宣起这件事情便急急忙忙地把材料上报了公司。
    公司工会接到这份材料，就向总局工会派在这里专门催促材料的庄德荣同志交差。庄德荣同志说：“公司领导人要看过，盖了章我才能收，这是局里的规定。”公司工会主席说：“我不看了，唐达余同志（公司工会干部）盖个章就行了吧！”公司工会盖了章，庄德荣同志便把材料带到总局里来。总局工会看见这份材料经过公司盖章，自然非常信任，于是经过审批会议，决定杨宣起为中南工程管理总局的甲等先进生产者，出席了总局的先进生产者代表会议，给予物质奖励。
    中南工程管理总局青年团团委看见这种情形，就将杨宣起的模范事迹上报武汉市团委，要求市团委授予杨宣起“青年突击手”称号。以后中南工程管理总局又派杨宣起出席全国建筑业先进生产者代表会议，并选杨宣起为中共武汉市第二次党代表大会和中共湖北省第一次党代表大会的代表。从此，杨宣起这名字就“平地一声雷，禹门三级浪”地在武汉地区传播开了。
    但是，杨宣起青年突击队队员们不大满意。一次中南工程管理总局第二工程公司举办了一个先进经验展览会，杨宣起和他的青年突击队员谢秀安等人一同去参观，队员发现展览会的材料上写有“乳剂油漆法创造人杨宣起”，马上有人当面质问杨宣起这是怎么一回事情。杨宣起没有理睬。队员更不满起来。在一次工地党支部大会上，有人揭发了杨宣起掠取别人荣誉的这一事实。但是，工地支部负责人认为这是打击杨宣起。为了弄清事情真相，队员们写了书面材料向中南工程管理总局党委监察委员会控告。总局党委监察委员会随即派人进行调查，证明杨宣起这个劳模确实是“创造”出来的。
    现在这件事情究竟由谁负责呢？总局工会认为，局里是信任公司的，公司盖了章，就应当负责。公司认为，局里要材料，我们只好叫下面收集，至于确定杨宣起是什么样的先进生产者，跟我们有什么关系呢？总局团委认为，我们要求武汉市团委授予杨宣起青年突击手称号，是根据总局工会评选为甲等先进生产者的材料，谁知总局工会的材料不可靠呢？工地认为，材料有出入我们有责任，但是不能负主要责任，因为总局和公司催的这样紧，叫我们那有时间去核对事实呢？
    公说公理，婆说婆理，究竟谁对呢？聪明的读者！你们来判断吧。
