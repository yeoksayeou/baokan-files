Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 4th: Budapest dispatch: On November 4th, the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government's "Appeal to the Hungarian People!" was published here. The full text is as follows:

		Appeal to the Hungarian People
	The Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government has been formed!

	On October 23rd, a mass movement was launched in our country. The noble purpose of this movement was to correct the anti-Party and anti-people errors committed by Rakosi and his accomplices, and to defend national independence and sovereignty. The weakness of the Imre Nagy government and the increasing strength of counter-revolutionary elements infiltrating the movement have endangered our socialist achievements, our people's state, our worker-peasant regime, and the very existence of our entire homeland.

	This situation has prompted us, Hungarian patriots, to establish the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government.

	The members of the government are:

	Prime Minister: János Kádár

	Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Armed Forces and Public Security: Ferenc Münnich

	Minister of State: György Marosán

	Minister of Foreign Affairs: Imre Horváth

	Minister of Finance: István Kossa

	Minister of Heavy Industry: Antal Apró

	Minister of Agriculture: Imre Dögei

	Minister of Trade: Sándor Rónai

	We are temporarily leaving the other ministerial positions vacant. After the legal system is restored domestically, we will invite representatives of other parties and non-party individuals who are loyal to our people's democracy and are prepared to defend their socialist achievements with us to take office.

	The newly formed government issues the following appeal to the Hungarian people.

	The Call of the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government

	Hungarian brothers!

	Workers!

	Peasants!

	Soldiers!

	Comrades!

	Our country is experiencing a difficult moment. The worker-peasant regime and the sacred socialist cause are in danger. A great danger threatens the achievements of the past twelve years, achievements that you, the Hungarian working people, and especially you, the Hungarian workers, have obtained with your own hands through heroic and selfless labor.

	Counter-revolutionary conspirators are increasingly revealing their true colors. They are brutally persecuting supporters of democracy, and Nyilas elements and other fascist murderers are killing loyal patriots and our excellent comrades.

	We know that our country still has many unresolved problems and many difficulties that we must strive to overcome. The lives of the working people are also far from the level that a country building socialism should have. In the past twelve years under the leadership of the Rakosi and Gerő group, in addition to making progress, many serious mistakes have been made and serious violations of the law have occurred, which have caused legitimate dissatisfaction among the working people.

	Reactionary elements are trying to achieve their selfish goals. They have already reached out to touch our people's democratic system. This means that they intend to return the factories to the capitalists, the land to the landlords, and they intend to once again let the gendarmes, the old officers, and the entire cursed old system of anti-people oppressors and exploiters ride on the backs of the people. If they win, they will not bring you freedom, welfare, and democracy, but slavery, poverty, unemployment, and brutal aristocratic oppression.

	Reactionary elements have taken advantage of the mistakes made in the process of building people's democracy and have misled many honest working people, especially most of the young people who participated in the movement out of a just and patriotic awakening. The working people advocate further promoting democracy in our entire social, economic, and political life to ensure the consolidation of the socialist foundations of our motherland. They loudly demand that Hungary grow and prosper as a free and sovereign country that maintains friendly relations with other socialist countries. Precisely because of this, it is incorrect and criminal to blame these people for participating in the movement.

	Counter-revolutionary forces have taken advantage of the weakness and incompetence of the Imre Nagy government to run rampant with tyranny, massacre, and plunder. We have reason to worry that this force will gain the upper hand.

	With deep sorrow and heavy hearts, we see what a terrible situation counter-revolutionary elements, and even many good and progressive people who consciously or unconsciously abused the slogans of democracy and freedom, thereby clearing the way for the reactionaries, have brought our beloved motherland into.

	Hungarians!

	Brothers!

	Patriotic people!

	Soldiers!

	Citizens!

	The tyranny of the counter-revolutionary elements must be stopped.

	The moment for action has arrived. Let us defend the worker-peasant regime and the achievements of people's democracy. We must restore order and establish security and tranquility in our country!

	The interests of the people and the interests of the motherland require the establishment of a strong and powerful government, a government capable of extricating the country from its current serious situation. For this reason, we have formed the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government.

	The Program of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government

	1. Unconditionally guarantee the national independence and sovereignty of our country.

	2. Repel all attacks to defend the socialist system of our people's democracy, defend our socialist achievements, and advance along the road of building socialism.

	3. Eliminate internal struggles and restore order and domestic peace in the country. The government will not allow any persecution of the working people who participated in these recent events.

	4. Establish fraternal and close friendship relations with all socialist countries on the basis of complete equality and non-interference in internal affairs, and establish our economic ties on the basis of mutual benefit and mutual assistance.

	5. Conduct peaceful cooperation with all countries, regardless of their social systems and forms of management.

	6. Rapidly and vigorously improve the living standards of the working people, especially the working class. Provide the working people with more housing and enable factories to build housing for their employees.

	7. Revise the national economic plan and change the methods of leading the economy according to the characteristics of the country in order to more rapidly improve the living standards of the residents.

	8. Eliminate bureaucracy and enable all strata of the working people to widely enjoy democracy.

	9. Establish worker management in factories and enterprises on a broad democratic basis.

	10. Increase agricultural production, greatly reduce the mandatory sales of agricultural products; help individual working farmers; the government is determined to eradicate all illegal practices that have arisen in the cooperative movement and land consolidation process, and ensure strict adherence to the principle of voluntariness in cooperation.

	11. Guarantee the democratic election of local power organs and revolutionary committees.

	12. Maintain private small industries and commerce in cities and villages.

	13. Persistently develop Hungarian national culture on the basis of our progressive traditions.

	14. The Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, for the sake of our people, our working class, and our homeland, requests the Soviet military command to help our people stop the reactionary and counter-revolutionary dark forces, restore the people's socialist system, and restore order and tranquility in our country.

	15. After order and tranquility are restored in our country, the Hungarian government will begin negotiations with the Soviet government and other participating countries of the Warsaw Pact on the issue of the Soviet military's stay in Hungary.

	Workers!

	Working peasants!

	Intellectuals!

	Hungarian soldiers and officers!

	Stand on the side of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government! Support the just struggle of our people! Defend our people's democratic system! Disarm the counter-revolutionary bandits everywhere!

	Organized workers! Unite your ranks around the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government. Immediately resume work in all enterprises.

	Communists! Set an example of heroism and self-sacrifice, and lead the struggle to defend our people's democracy!

	Working peasants! Defend your land, join hands with your worker brothers to fight for a common cause, for our people's democratic system.

	Hungarian youth, members of the Hungarian Working Youth League! Do not be misled. Only people's democracy can provide you with a bright and free future, defend your future!

	Hungarian working people! To realize your legitimate economic, political, and social demands, the primary condition is to defend the people's democratic regime, restore order, and restore production. The Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government is fighting for all of this and calls on all loyal Hungarian patriots to participate in this selfless struggle.

	Working people! Hungarian friends! Truth and justice are on your side!

	We will surely be victorious!

    匈牙利工农革命政府发表“告匈牙利人民书”
    新华社布拉格4日电　布达佩斯消息：11月4日，这里发表了匈牙利工农革命政府“告匈牙利人民书！”全文如下：
              告匈牙利人民书
    匈牙利工农革命政府组成了！
    10月23日在我国掀起了一个群众运动，这个运动的崇高目的是纠正拉科西和他的同谋者所犯下的反党、反人民的错误，保卫民族独立和主权。伊姆雷·纳吉政府的软弱以及钻入运动中的反革命分子的日益得势，使我们的社会主义成果、我们的人民国家、我们的工农政权和我们整个祖国的生存面临危险。
    这种情况促使我们匈牙利爱国人士建立匈牙利工农革命政府。
    政府的成员是：
    总理：亚诺什·卡达尔
    副总理兼武装部队和公安部部长：费伦茨·明尼奇
    国务部长：捷尔吉·马罗山
    外交部长：伊姆雷·霍瓦特
    财政部长：伊斯特万·科沙
    重工业部长：安托尔·奥普罗
    农业部长：伊姆雷·德盖伊
    贸易部长：山多尔·罗奈伊
    其他的部长职位我们暂时让它空着，要在国内恢复合法的制度以后，邀请忠于我们的人民民主、准备和我们一起保卫自己的社会主义成果的其他党派的代表和无党派人士担任。
    新成立的政府向匈牙利人民发出下列号召。
          工农革命政府的号召
    匈牙利的弟兄们！
    工人们！
    农民们！
    士兵们！
    同志们！
    我们的国家正经历着一个沉重的时刻。工农政权和神圣的社会主义事业处在危险之中。巨大的危险威胁着过去十二年来的成果，这些成果是你们，匈牙利劳动人民，而首先是你们，匈牙利工人以自己的双手经过英雄的忘我劳动而取得的。
    反革命阴谋分子越来越清楚地暴露了自己的面目。他们残酷无情地迫害民主的拥护者，尼拉什分子和其他法西斯凶手杀害忠诚的爱国者和我们优秀的同志。
    我们知道，我们的国家还有许多未解决的问题，还有许多有待我们努力加以克服的困难。劳动人民的生活也同一个建设社会主义的国家所应有的水平差得很远。在拉科西和格罗集团领导下的过去十二年内，除了取得进步之外，也还犯了许多严重的错误，发生过严重破坏法制的事情，这引起了劳动人民正当的不满。
    反动分子力图实现其自私的目的。他们已经伸出手来触动我们的人民民主制度。这就是说，他们打算把工厂归还资本家，把土地归还地主，他们打算重新让宪兵、旧军官、整个令人咀咒的、敌视人民的、压迫者和剥削者的旧制度重新骑在人民的头上。如果他们胜利了，他们给你们带来的不会是自由、福利和民主，而是奴役、贫困、失业和残暴的贵族压迫。
    反动分子利用了在人民民主建设过程中所犯的错误，把许多正直的劳动人民、特别是把大部分出自正义爱国觉悟参加了运动的青年引入了迷途。劳动人民主张在我们整个社会、经济和政治生活中进一步发扬民主，以保证巩固我们祖国的社会主义基础。他们大声疾呼，要求匈牙利作为一个同其他社会主义国家保持友好的自由和主权国家而成长、繁荣起来。正是因为这样，责备这些人参加运动，是不正确的和犯罪的。
    反革命势力利用了伊姆雷·纳吉政府的软弱无能而横行霸道、屠杀和掠夺，我们有必要担心这种力量会占上风。
    我们以深沉的悲痛和沉重的心情看到，反革命分子、甚至还有许多有意识或者无意识地滥用民主和自由口号从而为反动派扫清道路的善良而进步的人士，把我们可爱的祖国带进了多么可怕的境地。
    匈牙利人！
      兄弟们！
        爱国的人们！
            士兵们！
              公民们！
    应当制止反革命分子的横行霸道。
    行动的时刻到了。我们捍卫住工农政权和人民民主成果。我们要恢复秩序，在我国确立安全和安宁！
    人民的利益、祖国的利益要求建立一个坚强有力的政府，建立一个有能力使国家摆脱目前的严重处境的政府。因此，我们组成了匈牙利工农革命政府。
    匈牙利工农革命政府的纲领
    一、无条件地保障我国的民族独立和主权。
    二、击退一切进攻以捍卫我们的人民民主的社会主义制度，捍卫我们的社会主义成果和沿着建设社会主义的道路前进。
    三、消除内部斗争，恢复国家的秩序和国内和平。政府不允许对参加了最近这些事件的劳动人民进行任何迫害。
    四、同一切社会主义国家在完全平等、互不干涉内政的基础上建立起兄弟的紧密的友谊关系，并且在互利、互助的基础上建立起我们的经济联系。
    五、同一切国家，不论其社会制度和管理形式如何，进行和平合作。
    六、迅速大力改善劳动人民、特别是工人阶级的生活水平。给劳动人民更多的住宅，让工厂有可能替自己的职工建设住宅。
    七、根据本国的特点修改国民经济计划并且改变领导经济的方法，以便更迅速地提高居民的生活水平。
    八、消灭官僚主义，使一切劳动人民阶层广泛地享有民主。
    九、各工厂和企业在广泛民主的基础上建立工人管理。
    十、提高农业生产，大大减少农产品义务交售量；帮助个体劳动农民；政府决心铲除在合作化运动和土地整理过程中产生的一切不合法的做法，保证在合作化中严格遵守自愿原则。
  　十一、保证地方政权机构和革命委员会的民主选举。
    十二、在城市和乡村保持私人小工业和商业。
    十三、在我们进步的传统的基础上坚持不懈地发展匈牙利民族文化。
    十四、匈牙利工农革命政府为了我国人民、我国工人阶级和我们祖国的利益请求苏军司令部帮助我国人民制止反动和反革命黑暗势力，恢复人民社会主义制度，恢复我国的秩序和安宁。
    十五、在我国的秩序和安宁恢复后，匈牙利政府即着手同苏联政府和华沙条约其他参加国就苏军驻留匈牙利的问题进行谈判。
    工人们！
    劳动农民们！
    脑力劳动者们！
    匈牙利的士兵和军官们！
    站到匈牙利工农革命政府这边来！支持我国人民的正义斗争！捍卫我们的人民民主制度！解除各地反革命匪帮的武装！
    有组织的工人们！把你们的队伍团结到匈牙利工农革命政府的周围。立即恢复一切企业的工作。
    共产党人！作出英勇和自我牺牲的榜样，领导起捍卫我们人民民主的斗争！
    劳动农民们！捍卫你们的土地、同你们的工人兄弟携手为共同事业、为我们的人民民主制度斗争。
    匈牙利青年们，匈牙利劳动青年联盟盟员们！不要让人引入迷途。只有人民民主才能为你们提供美好的、自由的未来，捍卫你们的未来！
    匈牙利劳动人民！要实现你们正当的经济、政治和社会要求，首要的条件就是捍卫人民民主政权、恢复秩序、恢复生产。匈牙利工农革命政府正在为这一切进行斗争，并且号召一切忠实的匈牙利爱国者参加这个奋不顾身的斗争。
    劳动人民！匈牙利朋友们！真理、正义在你们这一边！
    我们一定会取得胜利！
                    匈牙利工农革命政府
