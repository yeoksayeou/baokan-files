Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 26th: Ten members of the Chinese Art Troupe that visited South America tragically died in a plane crash on November 24th while en route from Zurich, Switzerland, to Prague. The deceased were Li Dechun, Deputy Secretary-General of the Art Troupe; staff members Yu Liang, Deng Ziruo, Rao Qifeng, and Zhang Huaigen; Peking Opera actors Wu Mingshen, Zhang Chunlai, and Liu Youchun; and makeup artists Jiang Wenlin and Wang Wenhua. They boarded a Czechoslovak Airlines plane in Zurich on the afternoon of the 24th. Shortly after takeoff, the plane crashed in an area bordering Switzerland and West Germany. All twenty-three people on board, including the flight crew and passengers, perished. Among the passengers were members of the Czechoslovak ice hockey team in addition to the art troupe members.

The Director of the Czechoslovak Civil Aviation Administration and two technical experts have traveled to the crash site to investigate the cause of the accident.

The Chinese Embassy in Switzerland has dispatched a counselor and other personnel to the crash site to conduct an investigation and handle the aftermath. Currently, Zhao Feng, Deputy Head of the Art Troupe, and two others are continuing to handle the aftermath in Prague.

The remaining seventy-five members of the Art Troupe, led by Head Chu Tunan and Deputy Head Wang Li, have arrived in Moscow in batches before the 25th and will soon return home by train.

The Chinese Art Troupe conducted a performance tour in South America for more than two months, performing in Santiago, the capital of Chile; Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay; Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil; Sao Paulo, the economic and cultural center of Brazil; and Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina. They performed a total of fifty-eight shows, with a total audience of over 146,000 people. Over one million people watched the art troupe's performances on television.

The Peking Opera and folk song and dance performances by this Chinese Art Troupe, which was the first to visit South America, received enthusiastic praise from the audience. The art troupe conducted extensive exchanges with cultural and artistic circles and people from all walks of life in Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina, and received friendly receptions from people of all social strata.

After concluding its performances in Argentina in late October, the art troupe took a period of rest in Switzerland.
