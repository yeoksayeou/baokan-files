No One Should Have "Privileges"
Editor's Note: On November 5th, the "Reading Newspaper Thoughts" column published an article titled "Doing This is Right." The author, Comrade Hongcai, believed that the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Commerce's practice of prioritizing the supply of expensive goods to leaders was correct; demanding that leaders and experts line up to buy things like ordinary customers was a manifestation of egalitarianism. In the past half-month, the editorial department has received hundreds of letters expressing differing views from Hongcai's opinion. The following is a selection of these letters.

There is No Distinction Between "Ordinary" and "Special" Among Customers
The target of commercial work is the general public, and there is no distinction between "ordinary" and "special" here.

Hongcai believes that the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Commerce's use of privileges to prioritize the supply of certain expensive goods to certain leading cadres is "correct." Here, I want to ask: Isn't taking away goods that haven't even been put on the market considered "panic buying"? Don't the vast majority of "ordinary" customers really have the right to buy expensive goods? This is the first point I can't understand. Of course, leaders and experts need to master more, more comprehensive, and more complex work, and we should cherish their time. But if you think about it carefully, everyone in the high tide of socialist construction in the motherland—even a cook—cannot say that their work is unimportant or that their time shouldn't be cherished. If there isn't even a tiny screw, the entire machine won't turn. I think people understand this principle. This is the second point I want to make. The revolutionary teacher Lenin had more work than anyone else, but once when he needed to borrow a book from the library, he wrote on a note with his characteristic humility: "If, according to the library's borrowing rules, this type of reference book is not allowed to be taken home, could I borrow it for one night after the library closes and return it the next morning?" Lenin never saw himself as different from "ordinary" readers in these matters. We often say that we should learn from the revolutionary teachers, but why can't we do it in some specific issues?

Comrade Hongcai also cited the railway department's system of allowing employees to ride trains without paying fares and the coal miners' regulation of burning coal without paying for it as counter-evidence for the commercial department's prioritization of good goods for leaders. I believe Hongcai is confusing "privileges" and "systems," because railway personnel riding trains and coal miners burning coal without paying are "systems." The system is stipulated based on work needs and worker welfare (whether this "system" is reasonable is another matter). But I want to ask, what "system" is it for the commercial department to "prioritize the supply of expensive goods to leaders and experts"? And who "stipulated" it?

I firmly advocate that "this trend must not be allowed to continue," and I think this is simply an "evil trend." We should all work to block this "evil trend." Ran Liangbi

Awaken Those Who Abuse "Privileges"

We must oppose egalitarianism, and people should not object to taking care of leaders and some people with special needs across the board.

I will only analyze the essence of this so-called care from the issue of those fifty watches. Although I am not clear about who bought those watches and why the money has not been paid to this day, it can still be judged that this practice is illegal.

I believe this matter shows that some people deliberately want to use their privileges to achieve both the enjoyment of priority purchasing rights and the wearing of watches without paying cash; on the other hand, the broad masses of workers cannot buy watches even with cash. This is unfair. For some of these people, I think it is not an exaggeration to put a hat on them for infringing on state property and the interests of the people.

The seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that they abuse "privileges" again and again. Due to the influence of the commercial leadership, and due to the understanding of people like Comrade Hongcai, the scope of this "privilege" has spread to grassroots enterprises.

The reason why this "trend" has developed is that those who enjoy this preferential treatment are immersed in the sea of convenience, feeling very comfortable and "dizzy." These people should be awakened; people like Hongcai who understand the problem in this way should be educated so that they can wake up quickly. Yu Sheng

"Secret Shops" Are Illegal
The things revealed in the article "This Trend Must Not Be Allowed to Continue" are what an upright citizen should say.

The task of the commercial department should be to meet the growing material needs of the masses. It should face the masses, including leaders. In our socialist home, there should be no "special people." Lower-level cadres certainly should not regard leaders as "special people"; leaders should not regard themselves as "special people" either. Because it is the root cause of being divorced from the masses and violating laws and regulations. There are no ranks among the customers of the store, so the practice of opening "secret shops" should not exist today.

If opposing the destruction of the system and unprincipled care is also seen as egalitarian thinking, that is a principled error. The kind of thinking and style of "Section Chief Niu" in the film "Before the New Director Arrives" is disgusting. Does Comrade Hongcai also say that Section Chief Niu's approach is correct?

### 谁也不应该有“特权”

专栏：读报杂感

    谁也不应该有“特权”
    编者按　11月5日，“读报杂感”专栏发表了“这样做是对的”一文。作者鸿彩同志认为：黑龙江省商业厅把名贵的商品优先供应首长的做法是对的；要求首长和专家同一般顾客一样排队买东西，是一种平均主义的思想。近半月来，编辑部收到成百件来信，他们对鸿彩的意见提出不同的看法。下面发表是来信中的一部分。
    顾客中没有“一般”和“特殊”之分
    商业工作的对象是人民大众，这里没有什么“一般”与“特殊”之分。
    鸿彩认为黑龙江省商业厅利用特权把某些名贵的商品优先供给某些领导干部，“这样作是对的”。这里我要问：难道把还没有上市的商品优先拿走就不算“抢购”吗？难道这一些绝对多数的“一般”顾主就真的没有权利买到名贵的商品吗？这是我百思不解的第一点。当然，首长和专家们要掌握更多的、更全面的、更复杂的工作，我们应该珍惜他们的时间，可是仔细想一想，目前在祖国社会主义建设高潮中的每一个人——即使是炊事员吧，谁也不能说他们的工作就是不重要的，他们的时间就是不应该珍惜的，如果没有一个即使是渺小的螺丝钉，全部机器也就不会转动，这个道理我想人们是知道的。这是我所要说的第二点。革命导师列宁的工作比起任何一个人来说总该是更多的，可是列宁有一次在需要向图书馆借书时，他就用他特有的谦逊态度在字条上写：“如果根据图书馆借书的规则，这类参考书不许借回家里去看，可否等图书馆闭馆以后，我在晚间借出看一夜，第二天早晨我就一定归还呢？”列宁在这些事情上又何尝把自己看成是与“一般”看书的人不同呢？我们经常在说：要向革命导师学习，可是，为什么在一些具体的问题上就做不到呢？
    鸿彩同志还列举了铁路部门的职工有坐火车不付车费的制度，煤矿工人有烧煤不掏煤钱的规定来作为商业部门把好商品优先供给首长的反证。我认为鸿彩把“特权”和“制度”混淆起来了，因为铁道部门人员坐火车和煤矿工人烧煤不付钱是“制度”，制度是根据工作需要和工人福利等原因规定的，（这种“制度”是否合理是另一件事）；可是，我要请问，商业部门“把名贵商品优先供给首长和专家”是什么“制度”？又是谁“规定”的？
    我坚决主张“此风不可长”，而且认为这简直是一股“歪风”，我们大家都应该来堵塞这股“歪风”。　　　　　　　　　冉良弼
    吼醒滥用“特权”的人
    平均主义我们是要反对的，人们不应该对首长和一些有特殊需要的人的照顾一概加以反对。
    我仅从那五十块表的问题来分析一下这种所谓照顾的实质是什么。我虽然对那些表到底是谁买去的和为什么至今分文未付的原因不清楚，但也可以使人判断这种做法是不合法的。
    我认为这件事说明，有些人故意要利用自己的特权，想达到既要享受优先购买权，又要带不花现钱的表；在另一方面，广大职工群众凭着现钱却买不着表，这是不公道的事。对这样的一些人我看给他们戴上一个侵犯国家财产和人民群众利益的帽子不算过分。
    问题的严重性还在于，他们一而再，再而三的一次又一次的滥用
  “特权”。由于商业领导部门的影响，由于有像鸿彩同志的这些认识，这种“特权”的范围已经蔓延到基层企业了。
    这股“风”所以发展，是因为享受这种优惠的那些人都沉醉在便利自己的大海里，“晕呼呼”地很舒服。应该吼醒这些人；应该对像鸿彩那样认识问题的人进行教育，使他们赶快清醒起来。　　玉生
    “秘密商店”不合法
    “此风不可长”一文中所揭发的事，是一个正直的公民应该说的话。
    商业部门的任务，应该是满足群众日益增涨的物质要求，它要面向群众，首长也包括在内。在我们社会主义的家里，不应当有什么“特殊人物”的存在。下级干部固然不应当以“特殊人物”看待首长；首长更不应当以“特殊人物”自居。因为它是造成脱离群众，违法乱纪的根源。商店的顾客中没有等级存在，因此开办“秘密商店”的作法，在今天是不应该有的现象。
    如果把反对破坏制度，无原则的照顾，也看成是平均主义思想，那是原则性的错误。影片“新局长到来之前”中的“牛科长”的那种思想作风是令人作呕的，难道鸿彩同志也说牛科长的作法是对的吗？
