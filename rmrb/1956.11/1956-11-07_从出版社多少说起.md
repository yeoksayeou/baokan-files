    Starting from the Number of Publishing Houses
    Lí Zhī

    Comrade Zǐ Gāng published a short article on page eight of the People's Daily on October 26th: "Could Publishing Houses Be 'Consolidated'?" The main idea in the article seems to be that there are too many publishing houses at present and that they should be "consolidated" under unified leadership. I have a different opinion on this. Are there too many or too few publishing houses at present? I don't think the problem lies here. In the past, we were not without "consolidation"; on the contrary, some were "consolidated" too much, and some long-standing and distinctive publishing houses were "consolidated" away. As Comrade Zǐ Gāng said, "They are adjusted from time to time, and split up from time to time," so that they "unite after a long time of division, and divide after a long time of unity," but it always gives people the impression: "There are too many publishing houses, and the books are too chaotic." What is the reason for this? Is it really that there are too many publishing houses and that "consolidation" will improve the situation?

    I think not. On the contrary, there are too few distinctive publishing houses. Everyone publishes the same books, everyone has the same face, and even several publishing houses print the same book (as far as I know, Li Zhun's "Cannot Take That Road" has been printed by three central-level publishing houses). If this is the case, there can only be a distinction between "hardcover" and "ordinary," "complete works" and "selected works." If our publishing houses could all be run with their own distinct characteristics, then they would not seem too many but would seem too few.

    Is it necessary to have a large number of editors and unified leadership to run a distinctive publishing house? I don't think so. In the past, some publishing houses that had a great influence had only a few editors, or even only one or two people. Of course, our current situation is different, and the situation of submissions is also different, but the scale of publishing houses is now fundamentally different. Publishing houses like "People's Literature," "Youth," and "Popular" all have several editorial offices and many editors. Why can't they be run with more distinctive characteristics? (Of course, running well is not only reflected in being distinctive; I am only talking about this one characteristic.)

    There is a folk saying: "If you don't have children, blame the bed." I think our views on some things are often like this. For example, sometimes we think there are too many literary journals, and sometimes we think there are too few. Sometimes they are published in thirty-twomo format, and now they are all being changed to sixteenmo format. If there are no excellent works, we blame the poor creative conditions, too many administrative affairs, or too much crude criticism, and so on. Lu Xun, under such dark rule, together with the writers united around him, edited journals, published books, and carried out social activities, creating such a rich cultural treasure for our descendants. Can't we do more and better today under such superior conditions? Therefore, I think we shouldn't look for reasons too much in form, but should solve the problem fundamentally. What is the fundamental problem? This requires everyone to study, and I am only expressing a little foolish opinion. In my opinion, one of the fundamental problems is people, and the full exertion of the strength of existing cadres. Exert it like we fought underground in the era of reactionary rule, like we fought against the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It's a long story, so I'll stop here.

    从出版社多少说起
    黎之
    子冈同志在10月26日人民日报八版发表了一篇短文：“出版社可否‘综合’一下？”文中的主要意思似乎是说目前出版社太多，觉得应该“综合”一下统一领导。对此，我倒有不同的看法。目前出版社是太多还是太少呢？我看问题不在这里。我们过去并不是没有“综合”，相反的，有些“综合”得过火，而把一些历史悠久，特色鲜明的出版社“综合”掉了。正像子冈同志所说的“它们时而调整，时而分家”，这样“合久分，分久合”，但总给人们一种印象：“出版社多，出书太乱”。这是什么道理呢？是不是真的出版社太多了，“综合”一下就会好转呢？
    我想，不是，相反的，倒是有特色的出版社太少，大家都出一样的书，大家都是一个面孔，甚至一本书几个出版社都印（像李准的“不能走那条路”据我所知就有三个中央一级出版社印过）。既然如此，当然只能有“精装”和“普通”之分，“全集”和“选集”之分了。如果我们这些出版社都能办得有自己的鲜明特色，那就不会显得太多而是显得太少了。
    是不是要办得有特色就必须编辑众多，统一领导才行呢？我想也不然，我们看过去有些影响很大的出版社，编辑也不过几个人，甚至有些只有一两个人在顶着。当然，现在我们的局面不同，来稿的情况也不同了，不过，现在出版社的规模已经根本不同了。像“人民文学”“青年”“通俗”等出版社都是几个编辑室，编辑也很多，为什么就不可以办得更有特色一些呢？（当然，办得好不仅仅只表现在有特色上，我只不过仅就这一个特点来说）
    民间有句俗语：“不生孩子，怨炕头”。我觉得我们对一些事情的看法也往往是这样，比如说有时嫌文艺刊物太多，有时又嫌太少。有时出三十二开本，现在又都纷纷改成十六开本。没有优秀的作品出现，就怨创作条件太差，行政事务太多，或者说粗暴批评太多等等。鲁迅先生在那样黑暗的统治下面和团结在他周围的作家一起，又编刊物，又出书，又进行社会活动，为我们后代创造了那样丰富的文化宝藏。难道今天在这样优越的条件下面不能做得更多更好吗？所以，我想，不必太多地去在形式上找原因，还是多从根本上解决问题。什么是根本问题呢？这需要大家研究，我只不过发表一点愚人之见。我看来根本问题之一是人，是现有的干部的力量的充分发挥。发挥得像我们在反动统治时代在地下进行战斗那样，发挥得像我们在和日寇和国民党反动军队作战那样。说来话长，就此停住了。
