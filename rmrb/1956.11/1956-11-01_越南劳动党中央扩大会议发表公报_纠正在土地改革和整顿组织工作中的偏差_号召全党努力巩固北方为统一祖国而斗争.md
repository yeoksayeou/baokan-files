Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 31st: The Office of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party issued a communiqué on the 29th regarding the tenth enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party.

The tenth enlarged meeting was held in September this year. The communiqué stated that while the Vietnam Workers' Party has achieved many successes in leading the people in the struggle to consolidate North Vietnam, it has also made some deviations in certain tasks, such as land reform and organizational consolidation. The tenth enlarged meeting examined and discussed these deviations, pointed out the causes of the errors, proposed corrective measures, and called on the entire Party to unite closely, promote achievements, overcome shortcomings, and continue to forge ahead in the path of revolutionary struggle. The communiqué also announced the decisions of the tenth enlarged meeting on strengthening democratic rule of law, improving the people's livelihood, and the issue of the unification struggle.

Regarding the Land Reform Issue

Regarding the land reform issue, the communiqué pointed out that the land reform movement in North Vietnam has been basically completed. Thus, the Vietnamese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal tasks since 1930 have been basically completed in North Vietnam. At present, the landlord class in North Vietnam has been basically overthrown, land has returned to the hands of the peasants, and more than ten million peasants have been emancipated and become masters of the countryside; tens of thousands of local cadres have been trained. These achievements have made important contributions to consolidating North Vietnam and have created victorious conditions for the development of agriculture, industry, commerce, and cultural undertakings.

The communiqué pointed out that the Vietnam Workers' Party's rural work line is "thoroughly relying on poor and landless peasants, closely uniting with middle peasants, uniting with rich peasants, and abolishing feudalist ownership in a step-by-step, differentiated, orderly, and led manner." The communiqué pointed out that this line was not thoroughly implemented in the land reform. In many places, due to deviations in grasping the classification of rural class components and overestimating the land area and yield of peasants, some poor and landless peasants were attacked; the interests of many middle peasants were infringed upon; rich peasants were treated almost the same as landlords; and landlords who had participated in the war of resistance were not given appropriate consideration. In the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in conjunction with land reform, some places lost direction in their work and mistakenly attacked people in their own ranks. In some places, the people's religious beliefs were violated; in some places, the experience of the plains was mechanically applied to ethnic minorities in mountainous areas.

The communiqué pointed out that these errors are violations of the Party's policies and state laws.

Regarding Organizational Consolidation

Regarding the work of organizational consolidation, the communiqué stated that this work initially achieved some successes, but later, especially during the seventh and eighth phases of rent reduction and the fourth and fifth phases of land reform, errors developed relatively widely and seriously, causing serious damage to the Party organizations in the land reform areas.

The communiqué believes that the basic policy line of the Vietnam Workers' Party is correct, and the errors are mainly due to deviations in guiding ideology in the implementation of the policy line. For example, in mass movements, when "leftist" errors had already occurred, the leadership not only failed to detect these errors but instead emphasized opposing "rightist" tendencies. There were also serious shortcomings in organizational work, such as making the land reform agency a vertical, top-down system with excessive power.

Some cadres responsible for land reform also committed subjective and complacent shortcomings, failing to correctly implement the policy line, becoming detached from reality, and detached from the masses.

The communiqué pointed out that the errors in land reform and organizational consolidation were all "leftist" errors.

The tenth enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party decided that the current task of the entire Party is to resolutely correct the errors in land reform and organizational consolidation, while at the same time, promoting the achievements and victories that have been made.

The guiding principle for correcting errors is to carry out the work resolutely, cautiously, step-by-step, and with emphasis, overcome actions that are harmful to unity, guard against enemy sabotage, maintain rural tranquility; on the basis of ensuring the interests of working peasants, also appropriately take care of the interests of other strata; and grasp the Party's rural line.

The main content of the work of correcting errors is: incorrectly classified components should be corrected and appropriately compensated economically; the rights, reputations, and work of cadres and people who have been wrongly treated should be restored, and assistance should be given to them in life; those who sacrificed because of wrong treatment should be cleared of the charges, and their families should be cared for and comforted; land areas and yields that have been set too high should be reset; decisions to dissolve Party branches or require them to register should be abolished, and erroneous conclusions about the history of these provincial, county party committees and branches should be revoked; so that the previously wrongly treated party committees, branches, etc., become the core of unity and leadership of the people to participate in the work of correcting errors; the work of correcting errors shall be directly responsible by the party committees and local governments at all levels, and must be participated in by the groups and departments in the Fatherland Front.

The communiqué said that the Central Committee felt pained by the aforementioned errors and believed that the Central Committee should be responsible for the shortcomings and errors. However, the direct cause of these shortcomings and errors was due to the serious errors of the comrades who directly guided these tasks. The Central Committee member comrades who directly guided these tasks have made self-criticisms to the Party Central Committee. In order to maintain Party discipline and strengthen the education of these comrades and all cadres and Party members, the Central Committee has given these comrades appropriate disciplinary actions. The Party's attitude towards cadres who make mistakes is to focus on education and help them correct their mistakes.

Strengthening Democratic Rule of Law

Regarding the issue of strengthening democratic rule of law, the communiqué said that the Central Committee believes that since the August Revolution, a people's democratic system that is becoming increasingly strong has been established in Vietnam, which is one of the main factors guaranteeing the victory of Vietnam's war of resistance and the completion of the anti-feudal revolution in North Vietnam. However, there are still shortcomings in democratic rule of law. Therefore, the tenth enlarged meeting of the Central Committee has discussed and submitted necessary supplementary measures to the government and the National Assembly. These measures include: strengthening the education of cadres and people on the people's democratic system; consolidating and strengthening the people's electoral organs; clearly defining the relationship between the National Assembly and the government; revising the constitution; re-electing people's representative meetings and administrative committees at all levels, so that the people can more actively participate in state management and supervision of the regime; strengthening the democratic legal system, and supplementing various laws and regulations of the state; strengthening inspection work to ensure the people's democratic freedoms and rights.

Improving the Living Conditions of Workers, Troops, and Cadres

Regarding the issue of improving the living conditions of workers, troops, cadres, and staff, the communiqué said that the lives of workers, troops, cadres, and staff in Vietnam are still difficult. This Central Committee meeting decided to make suggestions to the government and take some measures to improve their living conditions to a certain extent. At the same time, it is necessary to study a more rational and comprehensive new salary policy and system to encourage production and gradually improve the living conditions of workers, troops, cadres, and staff. This work will be carried out simultaneously with improving the people's livelihood. The Central Committee believes that in order to improve living standards, it is necessary to do a good job in financial and economic work, develop the production of agriculture, industry, and handicrafts, and stabilize prices. To this end, it is necessary to study in detail the current financial and economic situation and formulate comprehensive and practical guidelines and plans for improving this work.

The Struggle for the Reunification of the Motherland

Regarding the struggle for the reunification of the motherland, the communiqué said that in June 1956, the Politburo had reviewed the leadership of the struggle for the reunification of the motherland and put forward specific proposals to continue to promote the struggle movement. The tenth enlarged meeting of the Central Committee agreed with the Politburo's views and proposals, and at the same time emphasized the following points: In the long-term struggle to realize the reunification of the motherland, consolidating the North is a fundamental task, and at the same time, it is necessary to correctly implement the policy of striving for the South; while consolidating the North, it is necessary to vigorously maintain and develop the struggle movement of the compatriots in the South; it is necessary to give full play to the strength of the people to promote the restoration and development of North-South relations.

The communiqué also mentioned that in order to prepare for the next Central Committee meeting, this Central Committee meeting decided to ask the Politburo to draft a plan on the line and policy of economic construction in North Vietnam and the plan to prepare for the convocation of the Third Party Congress.

    越南劳动党中央扩大会议发表公报
    纠正在土地改革和整顿组织工作中的偏差
    号召全党努力巩固北方为统一祖国而斗争
    新华社河内31日电　越南劳动党中央委员会办公厅在29日发表了一个关于越南劳动党中央第十次扩大会议的公报。
    第十次扩大会议是在今年9月间举行的。会议公报说明，越南劳动党在领导人民进行巩固越南北方的斗争中，在取得许多成绩的同时，也在某些工作，例如土地改革和整顿组织的工作中，犯了一些偏差。第十次扩大会议检查和讨论了这些偏差问题，指出了错误产生的原因，提出了改正的办法，号召全党紧密团结，发扬成绩，克服缺点，在革命斗争的道路中继续奋勇前进。公报还宣布了第十次扩大会议对加强民主法治、改善人民生活和统一斗争问题的决定。
    关于土地改革问题
    关于土地改革问题，公报指出，越南北方的土地改革运动已经基本完成。至此，从1930年以来的越南人民的反帝反封建任务，已经在北越基本完成。目前，越南北方的地主阶级已经基本上被推翻，土地回到了农民的手里，一千多万农民翻了身，成了农村的主人；数以万计的地方骨干已经培养出来。这些成果，对于巩固越南北方作出了重要的贡献，并且为发展农业、工商业和文化事业创造了胜利的条件。
    公报指出，越南劳动党的农村工作路线是“彻底依靠贫雇农，紧密团结中农，联合富农，有步骤、有分别、有次序、有领导的废除封建主义的所有制。”公报指出，这一路线在土地改革中没有被贯彻执行。不少地方，由于对划分农村阶级成分掌握有偏差和对农民的土地面积和产量估计过高等原因，使一部分贫雇农受到打击；侵犯了不少中农的利益；对富农差不多和地主一样看待；对参加过抗战的地主也没有给以适当照顾。在结合土地改革镇压现行破坏分子的工作中，有些地方在工作中失去方向，错打了自己队伍里的人。还有些地方，侵犯了人民的宗教信仰；有些地方，错误地把平原地区的经验机械地搬到山区少数民族中去运用。
    公报指出，这些错误是违背党的政策和国家法律的。
    关于整顿组织工作
    关于整顿组织的工作，公报认为，这个工作在起先曾经获得一些成绩，但在以后，尤其是第七、八期减租和第四、五期土地改革中，错误发展得比较普遍和严重，使土地改革地区党的组织受到严重损失。
    公报认为，越南劳动党的基本政策路线是正确的，错误主要是由于在执行政策路线中指导思想有偏差，例如在群众运动中，当“左”倾错误已经产生的时候，领导上不仅没有发现这种错误，反而一味强调反对“右”倾。在组织工作上，也有严重缺点，例如使土地改革机构成为一个垂直的自上而下的系统，具有过大的权力。
    一些担负土地改革工作的干部也犯了主观、自满的缺点，没有正确执行政策路线，脱离实际，脱离群众。
    公报指出，在土地改革和整顿组织工作中的错误，都是“左”倾的错误。
    越南劳动党中央第十次扩大会议决定：目前，全党的任务是坚决纠正土地改革和整顿组织工作中的错误，同时，发扬已经取得的成绩和胜利。
    纠正错误的方针是：坚决、谨慎、有步骤、有重点的进行工作，克服有害于团结的行动，提防敌人的破坏，维持农村的安宁；在保证劳动农民利益的基础上，同时适当照顾其他阶层的利益；掌握党的农村路线。
    纠正错误的工作的主要内容是：划错成分的应予更正，在经济上给予适当补偿；恢复被错误处理的干部和人民的权利、名誉和工作，并且给以生活上的帮助；为因被错误处理而牺牲的人洗刷清楚，给他们的家属以照顾和慰问；土地面积和产量被定得过高的，给以重定；废除错误地解散党的支部或者要它们登记的决定，取消对这一些省、县党委和支部的历史的错误结论；使以前被错误处理的党委、支部等成为团结和领导人民参加纠正错误的工作的核心；纠正错误的工作由各级党委和地方政权直接负责，并须得到祖国战线中的各团体和各部门的参加。
    公报说，对于前述错误，中央会议感到痛心，认为中央对缺点和错误要负责任。但是产生这些缺点和错误的直接的原因，是由于直接指导这些工作的同志的严重错误造成的。直接指导这些工作的中央委员同志已经向党中央做了检讨。为了维护党的纪律，加强对这些同志和全体干部党员的教育，中央已经给予这些同志适当的纪律处分。对犯错误的干部，党的态度是以教育为主，帮助他们纠正错误。
    加强民主法治问题
    关于加强民主法治问题，公报说，中央会议认为从八月革命以来，在越南已经建立起一个日益强大的人民民主制度，这是保证越南抗战胜利和在越南北方完成反封建革命的主要因素之一。然而，在民主法治方面目前仍然存有缺点。因此，中央第十次扩大会议已经讨论并且向政府和国民大会提出必要的补充的措施。这些措施包括：加强在干部和人民中进行关于人民民主制度的教育；整顿和加强人民选举机关；明确规定国民大会和政府的关系；修改宪法；改选各级人民代表会议和行政委员会，使人民更积极地参加国家管理工作和对政权的监督；加强民主法治制度，对国家的各种法律和法令进行补充；加强检查工作以保证人民的民主自由权利。
    改善职工和部队生活问题
    关于改善工人、部队、干部和职员的生活问题，公报说，目前越南的工人、部队、干部和职员的生活仍有困难。这次的中央会议决定向政府提出建议，采取一些措施，以便在一定程度上改善他们的生活。同时要研究一个比较合理和全面的新的薪金政策和制度，以鼓励生产和逐步改善工人、部队、干部和职员的生活。这个工作将和改善人民的生活同时进行。中央会议认为，为了改善生活，必须做好财政经济工作，发展农业、工业、手工业的生产和稳定物价。为此，必须详细研究当前的财经工作情况，并且制定出全面改进这个工作的切实的方针和计划。
    关于统一祖国的斗争问题
    关于统一祖国的斗争问题，公报说，1956年6月政治局曾经对争取祖国统一的斗争的领导进行检查，并且提出具体的主张，以继续推进斗争运动，第十次中央扩大会议同意政治局的看法和主张，同时强调以下几点：在为实现祖国统一的长期斗争中，巩固北方是带根本性的任务，同时必须正确实行争取南方的方针；在巩固北方的同时，必须大力维持和发展南方同胞的斗争运动；必须发挥人民的力量，来促进南北关系的恢复和发展。
    公报还提到，为了准备下一次的中央会议，这次的中央会议决定请政治局就越南北方经济建设的路线和政策以及准备召开第三次党代表大会的计划的问题拟出方案。
