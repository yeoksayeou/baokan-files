    Neijiang-Kunming Railway began laying tracks on the 6th. At 3:30 PM that day, workers from the Youth Track-Laying Team, who had previously worked on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, laid the first rail in the signal box west of Neijiang Station on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, braving the drizzle. This location is the connection point between the Neijiang-Kunming Railway and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway.
    The Neijiang-Kunming Railway is 789 kilometers long, starting from Neijiang, Sichuan, and ending in Kunming, Yunnan. This year, the track-laying task for the Neijiang-Kunming Railway is 69 kilometers. By the end of November, the track-laying team will have laid the tracks through Zigong City, a nationally renowned well salt production area. The track-laying workers have proposed to strive to lay an additional 18 kilometers of track this year, extending to Jingzichang in Yibin.

    内昆铁路开始铺轨
    新华社讯　内昆铁路6日正式铺轨。当天下午三时三十分，曾经铺设过成渝铁路和宝成铁路的青年铺轨队的工人们，冒着细雨，在成渝铁路内江车站以西的号志口地方，铺下了第一根钢轨。这个地方是内昆铁路同成渝铁路的接轨点。
    内昆铁路全长七百八十九公里，起自四川内江，终于云南昆明，今年，内昆铁路的铺轨任务是六十九公里。11月底，铺轨队将把路轨铺过全国闻名的井盐产地——自贡市。铺轨职工提出今年要争取多铺轨十八公里，铺到宜宾的敬梓场。
