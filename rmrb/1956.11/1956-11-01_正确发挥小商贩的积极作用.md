Editor's Note: Since many places across the country have successively opened free markets under state leadership, the business enthusiasm of small vendors has greatly increased. Small vendors in Sichuan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other places have already played a certain role in promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and supplementing the deficiencies of the socialist unified market. However, if small vendors are not given necessary leadership and management, abnormal situations such as speculative profiteering by some small vendors in Wuhan may occur. We are now publishing these two aspects of the situation below for reference by various localities when relaxing the management of rural markets and arranging the work of small vendors.

Small Vendors are Becoming Active

Since September, Beibei District, Chongqing Municipality, Sichuan Province, has continuously received small vendors from Bishan, Guang'an, Ba County, and other places. They have brought various local products and non-staple foods such as chickens, fresh eggs, bamboo, woodenware, and Chinese medicinal materials to the Beibei District market, and purchased some daily necessities and cotton to sell back to farmers in Bishan and other places.

Recently, at every market day in Xiema Town, Beibei District, the tea and travel cooperative stores are filled with these vendors from various places, and the catering industry's business is also booming.

After learning that they could conduct purchasing and sales activities "across regions," small vendors in Yangkou Town, Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, actively resumed their transportation business. Some vendors even transported live chickens, fresh eggs, pears, dried fish, and fermented soybeans from Yangkou Town to Fujian for sale, and then transported back goods such as homespun cloth and ramie from Fujian.

Since the comprehensive opening of free markets under state leadership at the end of September in Changtu County, Liaoning Province, small vendors from Changtu County, Shenyang City, and Siping City and Lishu County in Jilin Province have come to Xia'ertai in Changtu County to purchase small local products and medicinal materials. Every market day, tens of thousands of catties of hawthorn berries and hundreds of catties of mushrooms are bought by vendors. These small local products are things that the local supply and marketing cooperative could not purchase in the past.

Dayudian in Linru County, Henan Province, is a relatively large market in the eastern mountainous area of Linru City, and a distribution center for local products such as persimmons, pears, fresh eggs, furs, medicinal materials, bamboo and willow products produced in the nearby mountainous areas. However, since the local supply and marketing cooperative implemented a monopoly purchase method, market transactions have decreased. Now, the Dayudian market is becoming active with the relaxation of rural market management and the restoration of free purchasing and sales relations for small vendors. Small vendors are actively purchasing local and sideline products from farmers and supplying them with the industrial products they need.

Small vendors in Fuzhou City are frequently engaged in free purchasing activities in the countryside. During the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holidays alone, they purchased and farmers transported more than 2,800 chickens to the market. The market supply of freshwater fish also increased by more than half compared to the supply from the Fuzhou Food Company.

Abnormal Phenomena Appear Among Small Vendors in Wuhan

Some abnormal phenomena have appeared in the arrangement of small vendors in Wuhan. The business operations of some small vendors have deviated from the necessary control and management. They can obtain unlimited supplies from certain state-owned wholesale departments; some people, although they have made money and do not feel financially strained, can still obtain loans from banks. Illegal price increases and profiteering activities by some small vendors have also arisen, such as small vendors in the hardware and old goods industry raising the price of one ton of pig iron to 400 to 500 yuan, while the list price of pig iron from the Wuhan State-owned Hardware Company is only more than 200 yuan per ton. Due to the above reasons, many small vendors have obtained many unreasonable profits. Some vendors in the hardware and old goods industry, who had difficulty maintaining their livelihoods in the past, are now earning more than 1,000 yuan a month.

The main reasons for these phenomena are, first of all, that some departments have only paid attention to the arrangement of small vendors, while neglecting their transformation. For example, some state-owned commercial wholesale departments only focus on meeting the needs of small vendors for goods, but do not study what they operate that is most beneficial to the country and the people, and do not care about the business scope already roughly delineated between large and small vendors; they only care about meeting their loan requirements, but do not understand whether they really need them. Secondly, the relevant departments have not fully and comprehensively publicized the Party's policies on small vendors, and the education work for small vendors has not been done enough. Therefore, they believe that "if there are difficulties, the state will arrange it anyway." Thus, there has been a phenomenon of some small vendors squandering the money they earn while still applying for loans from banks as usual. Third, the relevant departments have relaxed market management while arranging small vendors, and have not frequently delved into understanding the situation and conducting inspections. Some small vendors, because the commodities they operate have a large market demand and the state cannot easily control their sources, take advantage of loopholes to engage in speculation and profiteering.

### 正确发挥小商贩的积极作用

    正确发挥小商贩的积极作用
    编者按　全国许多地方相继开放国家领导下的自由市场后，小商贩的经营积极性大大提高。四川、江西、湖北等地小商贩们，在促进城乡物资交流、补充社会主义统一市场的不足方面已经起了一定的作用。但是，如果对小商贩不加以必要的领导和管理，也可能发生像武汉市部分小商贩投机牟利的不正常情况。现在我们把这两方面的情况发表在下面，以供各地在放宽农村市场管理，安排小商贩工作时参考。
    小商贩们活跃起来了
    四川省从9月份以来，重庆市北碚区不断地接待着来自璧山、广安、巴县等地的小商贩。他们给北碚区市场贩来了鸡、鲜蛋、竹子、木器、中药材等各种土产和副食品，又购买一些日用品和棉花回去卖给璧山等地的农民。
    近来，北碚区歇马场每逢集日，场上的茶旅社合作商店住满了这些来自各地的商贩，饮食业的生意也因此大为兴隆。
    江西省广丰县洋口镇的小商贩，在得知可以“越区”进行购销活动的消息后，积极地恢复了贩运业务。有些商贩还特地从洋口镇贩运毛鸡、鲜蛋、梨、干鱼、豆豉等到福建去卖，然后又从福建贩回土布、苎麻等货物。
    辽宁省昌图县从9月底全面开放国家领导下的自由市场后，昌图县、沈阳市和吉林省的四平市、梨树县等地的小商贩，纷纷到昌图县下二台来采购小土产和药材。每逢集日，上万斤的山里红和数百斤蘑菇，都被小贩买去。这些小土产，都是过去当地供销社收购不了的。
    河南省临汝县大峪店是临汝城东山区一带较大的集市，附近山区所产的柿子、梨、鲜蛋、皮毛、药材、竹柳货等土产品的集散地。但是，自从当地供销社实行了独家包收的办法后，市场交易减少。现在，大峪店市场随着放宽农村市场的管理和小商贩自由购销关系的恢复而活跃起来。小商贩们积极收购农民的土副产品，并且供应给农民所需要的工业品。
    福州市小商贩们下乡自由采购的活动很频繁，单是在中秋、国庆两个节日前后，由他们下乡采购和农民挑运上市的鸡就有二千八百多只。淡水鱼上市量也比福州市食品公司供应量增加了一半以上。
    武汉市小商贩出现
    不正常的现象
    武汉市在安排小商贩中出现了一些不正常的现象。部分小商贩的营业脱离了必要的控制和管理。他们可以从某些国营批发部门无限制地得到货源；有些人虽然赚了钱，资金并不感到困难，但仍旧可从银行得到贷款。有些小商贩的非法抬价、牟取暴利的活动也乘机而起，如五金旧货业的小商贩把一吨生铁的价格抬高到四百元到五百元，而武汉市国营五金公司的生铁牌价每吨只二百多元。由于以上种种原因，不少小商贩得到很多不合理的利润。五金旧货业中有的商贩过去维持生活都很困难，现在竟一个月赚一千元以上。
    产生这些现象的主要原因，首先是由于某些部门只重视了对小商小贩的安排，而忽视了对他们的改造。如有些国营商业批发部门只顾满足小商贩对货源的需要，却不去研究他们经营什么最有利于国家和人民，也不管已经大体上划定的大商小贩之间的经营范围；只管满足他们的贷款要求，却不去了解他们是否真正需要。其次，有关部门没有充分地全面地宣传党对小商小贩的政策，对小商小贩的教育工作做得不够，因此他们认为“有了困难反正有国家来安排”。从而便出现了有些小商贩一面把赚的钱挥霍浪费，一面却照常向银行贷款的现象。第三，有关部门在安排小商贩的同时，放松了市场管理工作，没有经常深入了解情况，进行检查，某些小商贩因为他所经营的商品市场需要量大，而国家又不易掌握其货源，便投机取巧，牟取暴利。
