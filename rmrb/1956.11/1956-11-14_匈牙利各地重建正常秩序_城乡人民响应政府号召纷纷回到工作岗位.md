Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 12th: According to TASS, residents of Budapest are responding to the government's call to resume work and are returning to their jobs. Now, tens of thousands of employees are calmly working again, and many industrial enterprises and institutions have resumed operations. Although trams, trolleybuses, and subways have not resumed operation in the city, buses are running on many routes. The administrative authorities and workers' committees of the factories have organized their own transportation to transport workers to and from work.

The people's power organs are working hard to alleviate the difficult situation that Budapest still faces. In order to restore and construct the destroyed cities and villages as quickly as possible, the Government Restoration and Construction Committee was established in Budapest. The Workers and Peasants Revolutionary Government issued an order to greatly increase the piece-rate wages of construction workers starting today. Work has begun to clean up streets and squares. Buildings with a risk of collapse are being demolished. The doors and windows of shops and offices have been re-glazed. Unexploded mines, grenades and other ammunition are being cleared from the city. Work to restore tram lines and overhead power grids is being carried out on a large scale.

The food situation in Budapest has improved. All grain stores have reopened. The city's slaughterhouses are working at full capacity. On November 12, about twenty carloads of meat and the same amount of fat were transported from other provinces. A large amount of meat and meat products have also been transported from abroad. The Hungarian people are willing to help Budapest's recovery. Eighty thousand geese and ducks were transported from Cegléd. Large quantities of grain are being transported from Szabolcs, Borsod, Baranya and other counties.

The chimneys of the Csepel Metallurgical United Factory in Budapest smoked again on November 12. Although the Óbuda shipyard, automobile factory and other largest enterprises in the city still have many difficulties, and some workshops in the factory cannot start production, the workers have returned to the workshops.

The counter-revolutionary bandits caused great damage to the city's public utilities. Until now, many areas of the capital have no water, electricity, or gas. Measures are now being taken to restore urban public utilities.

People's Daily, Moscow, November 13th: According to a report from a special correspondent of Pravda in Budapest on November 12: On November 12, an atmosphere of peaceful life reappeared on the streets of Budapest. The period when the city's residents dared not leave their homes due to white terror has passed. On the 11th and 12th, residents throughout the city were able to leave their homes and come to the streets from early morning.

Large numbers of transportation vehicles can already be seen on the streets of Budapest. The words "Grain" are written in large characters on the vehicles. The city's food supply is gradually increasing. On November 12, dozens of trucks loaded with supplies from the German Democratic Republic and Poland arrived here.

The first bus appeared on the street. In Moscow Square, groups of residents are getting on the 69 bus. The city's people are beginning to repair the doors and windows of shops and residences destroyed by counter-revolutionaries. The Workers and Peasants Revolutionary Government has drafted construction measures to repair houses. The Budapest Urban Construction Committee was established on November 12 and will be responsible for repairing the urban construction destroyed by counter-revolutionaries. The Budapest urban power grid also began to be repaired on November 12.

Workers in factories in the Budapest urban area are beginning to go to work. Workers at the huge steel mill and Gottwald factory are preparing to start production. The city's schools will also gradually resume classes.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 13th: The Hungarian Workers and Peasants Revolutionary Government is working hard to establish normal order in the country.

Shooting is no longer heard in Budapest. Government agencies have started working. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responding to the call of the revolutionary government, is restoring work. The city post office and the Ministry of Agriculture have started working. The Ministry of Agriculture called on farmers to work hard to complete the autumn harvest and planting, and pointed out that the most important thing at present is to establish order and restore production. Hungarian troops and police are appearing on the streets to maintain law and order. Transportation equipment is being checked and repaired, and more and more buses are running in the city. Rubble on streets and squares is being cleared. Bakeries have begun to supply products as usual, and every bakery has sufficient flour and fuel. Public canteens have also begun to operate as usual. Thanks to the support of the Hungarian countryside and the assistance of fraternal countries, the food supply situation in Budapest is constantly improving. Almost all food stores in Budapest are open for business, and many factories are preparing their own food to supply the needs of their employees. The Ministry of Construction called on construction workers to restore the destroyed houses in large quantities and to collect the broken glass and hand it over to the recycling company.

Railway transportation from Budapest to other places has gradually resumed. Large numbers of trucks carrying milk, vegetables, potatoes and other foods are driving from various agricultural areas to Budapest.

The working people of Budapest are assisting in eliminating bandits. Many guns and cannons handed over by counter-revolutionaries are placed on Lenin Avenue. Residents in various districts have helped the government to eliminate bandits, and reported any abandoned weapons to the police station immediately. Many houses are guarded by residents at their own doors, preventing bad elements from entering. Residents have also reported the whereabouts of saboteurs, demanding that the government eliminate them and protect the safety of residents.

In many areas outside Budapest, the situation has stabilized.

In central and eastern Hungary, the sugar factory, automobile repair factory and sulfuric acid factory in Szolnok have all resumed work. The supply of materials in Szolnok and throughout the county is satisfactory, and people can buy enough dairy products, flour, meat and lard. Szolnok sends 60 to 70 quintals of bread to the capital every day, as well as large quantities of lard, meat, flour and dairy products. The railway lines from Szolnok to Szentes, Cegléd and other places have been restored to transport. Schools have resumed classes since November 8. Autumn field work in Szolnok County is in progress. Tram and bus transportation in Debrecen returned to normal a few days ago. Work to repair damaged houses has begun, and automobile repair shops and other enterprises have resumed work.

In the south, the supply of materials in Kaposvár, the capital of Somogy County, is smooth. In textile factories, sugar factories and food factories, work is being carried out without interruption. This city has provided a great deal of assistance to Budapest and other cities. A large amount of food has been transported from Kaposvár to the capital. The working people of Kaposvár are also transporting food to the cities of Nagykanizsa and Pécs.

Győr in western Hungary is very calm and in good order. Local cinemas have begun showing films. Just like in Szeged and Pécs, transportation in Győr has also resumed. In Zala County, work in the oil fields is progressing actively, but the transportation of products is still very difficult. The farmers in this county are completing autumn field work.

In northern Hungary, all enterprises in Vác County have resumed work. Some factories have not resumed to normal levels due to lack of raw materials and certain technical difficulties. Railway transportation throughout the county has resumed. 90% of employees in Szabolcs County have gone to work. The steel mills and glass factories in Salgótarján have also started work. Some industrial enterprises still lack raw materials. However, this shortage will soon be eliminated, because the important industrial center of Borsod County, Ózd, has promised to transport raw materials. 70% of the miners in the coal mines in this area have gone to work.

    新华社布达佩斯13日电　匈牙利工农革命政府正在全力进行工作，建立国内的正常秩序。
    布达佩斯已不再听到射击声音。政府机关开始了工作。外交部响应革命政府的号召，正在恢复工作。市邮局和农业部已经开始办公。农业部号召农民努力完成秋收秋种工作，并且指出目前最主要的是建立秩序，恢复生产。街头出现了维持治安的匈牙利军队和警察。交通设备正在检查和修理，公共汽车已经越来越多地在市内行驶。街道和广场上的瓦砾正在清除。面包房已经开始照常供应产品，每一个面包房的面粉和燃料都很充足。公共食堂也已经开始照常营业。由于匈牙利乡村的支援和兄弟国家的援助，布达佩斯的粮食供应情况正在不断改善。布达佩斯的食品商店差不多全部开门营业，许多工厂正在自行备办粮食以供应本厂职工的需要。建筑部号召建筑工人大量恢复被破坏的房屋，将碎玻璃搜集起来交到收购公司。
