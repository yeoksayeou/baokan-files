    Busy Freight on the Jining-Erlian Railway
    Since the Jining-Erlian Railway, which connects the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe, began handling international through freight in January this year, the volume of freight has increased month by month. The transportation volume in September was three times that of January. Large machinery supplied by the Soviet Union to equip our new factories and mines, precision instruments from the German Democratic Republic, large quantities of tractors and combine harvesters manufactured by Hungary and Czechoslovakia, automobiles from Poland, and horses and leather from the Mongolian People's Republic are all transported from here. Materials from Eastern European brother countries assisting the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also pass through here. This is a picture of our customs and cargo transfer personnel at the Erlian station inspecting goods from abroad.

    集二铁路货运忙
    联系苏联、蒙古和东欧各人民民主国家的集二铁路，自从今年1月开始办理国际货物联运以来，运货量逐月增加，9月份的运输量等于1月份的三倍。苏联供应我国装备新建厂矿的大型机械、民主德国的精密仪器、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克制造的大批拖拉机和联合收割机、波兰的小汽车、蒙古人民共和国的马匹和皮革，都从这里运来。东欧各兄弟国家援助越南民主共和国的物资也从这里经过。这是二连车站的我国海关和货物交接人员在验收来自国外的货物。
