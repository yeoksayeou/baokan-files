Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 28th -- TASS reports from Stockholm on the 28th: Representatives of the Communist Parties of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden held a meeting in Stockholm on the 25th and 26th and adopted a declaration calling on the governments of the Nordic countries to pursue policies dedicated to ending the "Cold War" and achieving universal disarmament.

The declaration stated: The people of the Nordic countries are anxious that the forces of war and reaction are engaged in open aggression and an increasingly fierce "Cold War," which is causing a sharpening of the international situation. The events in the Near East and Hungary show that an increasingly serious threat of war looms over the Nordic countries and the people of our small countries. The people of the Nordic countries realize that peace is the fundamental condition for making the entire Nordic region prosperous and making fruitful cooperation between these countries possible.

The declaration said that, for the benefit of the Nordic countries, the governments of the Nordic countries should also strive to achieve the following demands: the withdrawal of foreign troops from these countries and the removal of their bases in these countries, a demand for the abolition of military blocs, striving for universal disarmament, the elimination of atomic and hydrogen bomb stockpiles, and a ban on continued testing of such weapons.

    北欧四国共产党发表宣言
    要求结束冷战实行普遍裁军
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩28日讯：丹麦、芬兰、挪威和瑞典四国共产党的代表25日和26日两天在斯德哥尔摩举行了会议，并且通过了一项宣言，要求北欧国家的政府奉行致力于结束“冷战”普遍裁减军备的政策。
    宣言说：北欧人民焦虑的是，战争和反动势力进行公开侵略和越来越炽烈的“冷战”，这引起了国际局势尖锐化。近东和匈牙利事件表明，日益严重的战争威胁笼照着北欧和我们这些小国家的人民。北欧国家人民意识到，和平是使整个北欧繁荣和使这些国家之间的有成效的合作成为可能的基本条件。
    宣言说，为了北欧国家的利益，北欧国家的政府还应当为实现下列要求而努力：外国军队撤离这些国家和撤销它们在这些国家的基地，要求废除军事集团、争取普遍裁减军备、消除原子弹和氢弹储备以及禁止继续试验这种武器。
