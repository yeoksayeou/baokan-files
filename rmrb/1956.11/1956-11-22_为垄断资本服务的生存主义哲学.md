    The pessimistic psychology that often envelops most bourgeois intellectuals is widely disseminated in modern bourgeois philosophy. Decadence and pessimism are most evident in existentialist philosophy, which, along with semantic idealism and Catholic philosophy, is one of the most popular bourgeois philosophical trends of our time. It has deep-rooted foundations in various Western European countries. It is no accident that this trend occurred precisely among French bourgeois intellectuals who were under the iron heel of Hitler during World War II. Similarly, it cannot be considered a coincidence that this trend was particularly popular in West Germany in the first few years after the end of World War II.

    The main representatives of existentialism are Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger in Germany, and Miró-Ponty and Camus in France.

    Christian existentialism is a variant of existentialism that is close to Catholic philosophy and has in fact merged with the latter. In France, this school is represented by the famous reactionary philosopher Gabriel Marcel, author of "Studies on the Essence of Spiritual Life" and "Being and Having."

    Existentialists call Søren Kierkegaard their predecessor. Kierkegaard was a 19th-century Danish philosopher who died in a mental asylum. A recurring theme in Kierkegaard's writings is death and the expectation of death, the fear of death, the struggle with death, and so on. Currently, his works are being heavily promoted by reactionary bourgeois newspapers. Kierkegaard has been regarded as the "prophet" of existentialism, the first philosopher to propose existentialist ideas, while the German reactionary idealist philosopher Nietzsche has been designated as the second "prophet" of existentialism.

    In order to win the support of the masses, existentialists have tried their best to exploit certain erroneous and reactionary ideas in the works of the great Russian writer Dostoevsky.

    What exactly is existentialist philosophy, what does it propagate, what does it advocate, and what does it teach its disciples and followers?

      I. Existentialists' Advocacy of Death

    The first proposition of existentialist philosophy is that "individual existence" is the object of philosophy. This is the starting premise for all other arguments of the existentialists. The objective laws of natural and social development do not interest them; they are only concerned with the subjective psychological world and its inner feelings. Jaspers, one of the most famous existentialists, worked as a psychiatrist for many years, and many specialized works in this field came from his pen. It is worth noting that the existentialists' research is actually limited to the psychology of patients; they do not pay attention to healthy, psychologically balanced people, but to people with morbid psychology and weakened will.

    The next proposition of the existentialists is that human existence does not have what philosophy calls essence as its foundation. Existentialists say, "Existence precedes essence." This is where the name of this philosophical school, "the philosophy of existence," comes from.

    Every school of philosophy always solves a fundamental philosophical problem, namely, what is primary: existence or consciousness. Existentialists solve this basic philosophical problem in their own way, but they also falsify the way the problem is posed. They replace the above basic philosophical question with a vague and confusing question of whether "existence" comes before "essence."

    The existentialists' so-called "existence" refers to subjective intuition and feelings. They believe that the category of "existence" includes: sensations, pleasant and unpleasant moods, emotions of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, sadness, anger, hesitation, and so on. These are all part of the individual's inner world. However, existentialists first reduce "existence" to emotions. They do not see people as social beings, but only as a special condensation of personal feelings. Existentialists replace the objective existence of objects, events, and processes with a process of changing subjective psychological states.

    What does the existentialists' so-called "essence" refer to? In the above-studied problem, essence is understood as: human existence seems to be transformed from something purely accidental and arbitrary into a sum of phenomena, which carries a certain law-abiding nature and has a certain content and the cause of its own occurrence. The phenomena of human psychological life seem to be the revelation of the essence of human existence.

    The existentialists insist that existence has no essence and precedes essence, which means that everything that happens in the human inner world, all the changes that occur in it, the replacement of moods, etc.—all of this seems to have only a purely accidental and meaningless nature. All these changes seem to have no external objective cause. Regarding this, one existentialist once declared: Our birth lacks any cause and any meaning, just as our death is absurd.

    Therefore, the thesis that existence has no essence is also an assertion that human existence is meaningless.

    Everyone can see that this philosophy is extremely decadent, and it weakens the strength and perseverance of the masses. If there is really nothing definite or essential in life, and everything is accidental, meaningless, and foolish, then is it worth living? And the existentialists' answer is: Human life is a contradiction, and it can be said of this contradiction that it would be better if it did not exist.

    Existentialists claim that people are "thrown" or "dropped" into the world. Who, or what force, threw them into the world? Christian existentialists, like Gabriel Marcel and others who share his views, answer this question in this way: "God 'threw' people into the world and then left them alone there."

    Therefore, people are alone and helpless in dealing with the world they feel. And the main feeling of people, the keynote of all his moods, according to the existentialists, is the lonely fear and the fear of death. Jaspers said that human existence is full of "anxiety," "panic," and "fear of death." This argument is a slander against normal, healthy people.

    Progressive thinkers have always pointed out that optimism, seething with vitality, is inherent in a healthy person. The great Dutch materialist Spinoza of the seventeenth century had long said that a free man thinks least about death. The great Russian revolutionary democrat Herzen talked ecstatically about the vigorous optimism that illuminates the difficult and glorious path of fighters for the happiness of the people. He said: "Man is not a pawn in the hands of fate, but the creator of his own future."

    The genius teachers and leaders of the working class, Marx, Engels, and Lenin, have repeatedly emphasized that the inherent characteristics of the proletariat are a deep belief in the future, infinite activity, the will to win the struggle for the liberation of the working people, and a love of life. The revolutionary working class has comprehensively demonstrated all these characteristics in the struggle for socialism, the construction of a communist society, and the creation of a new way of life.

    The existentialists cannot avoid the issue of the relationship between the subjective and the objective world. But do they recognize the existence of an objective material world? Absolutely not. Existentialists often talk about "objects," but in their view, objects are a malicious force that breaks into the human inner world, disrupts the peace of this world, and fills it with "unease."

    Existentialists say that our entire life is a road to death. What will death bring? Death will free us from existence. After death, people transition to a realm of insensible nothingness. And this "nothingness," the existentialists affirm, is the true essence of the world.

    Therefore, this reactionary philosophy is actually a denial of objective reality.

    II. On the Dialectics Fabricated by Existentialists and Where This Dialectics Leads People.

    Can people know the world? The answer to this question can reveal many aspects of existentialist philosophy. The existentialists' answer to this question is negative. In addition, they also speculate on the dialectical relationship between essence and phenomenon, absolute truth and relative truth, and they declare: cognition is like a kitten chasing its own tail. Knowing the truth seems like capturing a bird that people can never catch, although it seems to the person that the bird is about to fall into his hands. They say: To know what is called cognition is to determine what is the essence of the phenomenon. This means that in the chaotic state of events that seem messy and difficult to understand, to find the dominant clues, to find the laws that determine these events, to find the law-abiding chain of cause and effect. But, the existentialists say, since the essence is "nothingness," therefore, in order to understand the essence, people must bid farewell to their own lives and throw themselves into the realm of this "nothingness," in other words, end their lives by suicide. The existentialists also solemnly write that the best way to know the truth seems to be suicide. For example, Jaspers said, "True knowledge can only be obtained under critical circumstances." What is called "critical circumstances?" This refers to the realm between life and death, in other words, there can only be knowledge on the border of imminent death. Jaspers then said: "The experience gained in the moment of suicide is very meaningful."

    In an article published in the Soviet "Pravda" a few years ago, the existentialists were very accurately called "gentlemen of the underworld." Indeed, these are "gentlemen of the underworld" who advocate death and call on people to die. From their philosophy, one can smell the odor of corpses and the breath of decay.

    The philosophy of existentialism is hostile to reason and science. Existentialism despises natural sciences and sociology, denies the existence of objective laws of natural and social development, and denies the possibility of recognizing and appropriately utilizing these laws.

    Existentialists, especially those in West Germany, often claim that they are the heirs to the dialectics created by the representatives of German classical idealism in the nineteenth century. Everyone knows that this dialectics, although idealistic in nature, still has its progressive effect. However, the existentialists' "dialectics" is different in principle from Hegel's dialectics; and it is even further from the truly scientific Marxist materialist dialectics. What the existentialists are talking about is a so-called "tragic dialectics." The extreme pessimism in their philosophy is expressed in an expanded form in this doctrine of "tragic dialectics." The ideological essence of "tragic dialectics" can be summarized as follows: the human world is full of inherent contradictions; these contradictions cannot be resolved, they conflict with each other, and the result of the conflict causes the individual to die tragically.

    In this way, existentialists limit dialectics to the scope of personal consciousness. What is obtained is not the living dialectics of the objective world, but a special schema of the conflict of various personal feelings. At the same time, according to the existentialists, the result of contradictions and conflicts is not progress, but inevitable destruction and the end of all movement.

    Lenin pointed out in his "Philosophical Notebooks" that the "struggle" of opposites carries an objective, non-subjective nature, and is the source of development and progress. Seeing the opposite as the source of development allows us to understand the phenomenon from the "living" life of the phenomenon. Only it provides the key to understanding the "self-movement" of all beings, only it provides the key to understanding "leap," "interruption of gradual process," "the demise of the old and the birth of the new."

    As for the dialectics of existentialists, it is not dialectics at all, it is a metaphysical doctrine with a subjective idealist nature. The purpose of existentialism lies entirely in: making the workers lose their way, isolating them from each other, eliminating the class consciousness of the proletariat, so that they do not regard their class enemies as their opponents, but as partners in a meaningless journey to meet death. It is no accident that Jaspers, one of the giants of existentialism, said: "Studying philosophy is to learn death."

    Here is a question: Does this philosophy of suicide merely find a theoretical basis for pessimism, merely preach that people should be resigned to their fate and not struggle? No, the problem is not just that.

    As already pointed out above, existentialism reflects a decadent psychology that envelops modern imperialist bourgeois groups and a part of the petty bourgeoisie who follow them. Existentialists attempt to make the working people disgusted with themselves. But, do not forget that the philosophy of existentialism also reflects, in its own special form, a war-mongering intention inherent in the most aggressive imperialist elements. In this regard, West German-style existentialism is a prime example.

    For example, Jaspers said that the greatest satisfaction a person can experience is "death like a soldier." In this way, Jaspers is advocating a reactionary idea—the desire to die in battle, an idea that is being used by the heads of West German monopoly capital to make cannon fodder. This "idea" is also an ideological education of the personnel of the various divisions established in the Federal Republic of Germany as the new defense forces. Jaspers even creates a "philosophical basis" for the military and economic "European commonality" promoted by pro-American politicians. He is trying his best to derive this "commonality" from the "depths of the German spirit."

    In his book "On the Origin and Purpose of History," Jaspers talked about the "attack" on Western Europe by the peoples of the Eastern countries he fabricated, and anxiously pointed out the increasing activity of the masses. This kind of argument is also beneficial to the imperialists, because they have long been using the notorious "threat of Eastern countries" to scare people, in order to make the people of Western European countries fall into a state of nervousness and war hysteria.

    In this way, propagating existentialism is not only advocating pessimism and decadence, but also praising militarism and the "soul of soldiers." From here, it is not difficult to see existentialism's loyalty to monopoly capital.

    III. Existentialism's Reactionary Ethics

    The ethics of existentialism cannot but be mentioned. Taking the moral doctrine of the existentialists as an example, it can be most convincingly illustrated that the philosophy of the modern bourgeoisie is full of the spirit of non-moralism. Because if life is a foolish illusion and nonsense, then it can be concluded that there are no and cannot be any definite objective moral standards, and there are no and cannot be any definite criteria for individual behavior. It seems that a person does not have any responsibility to his class, family, relatives, and anyone (including himself). The French existentialist Miró-Ponty wrote that no one has ever "seen a class," which means that there cannot be any obligation in the relationship with the class. People are as they please to themselves and others, and they have no responsibility to anyone. This is one of the basic theses of existentialist ethics. This ethics is a defense of betrayal, apostasy, and all kinds of immoral crimes.

    Existentialists claim that they are "humanitarians" because they are fighters for human "freedom." But, what do they regard as human "freedom?" They regard a person's irresponsibility, in other words, this person's spiritual debauchery, as freedom. We can find such strange words in the existentialists: "People are destined to be free." The word "destined" is used because, in the existentialists' view, freedom is a disaster. They believe that only when a person is "not free," when he can absolutely not settle himself (i.e., death), is he happy. And when he is alive, he is unfortunate, tortured, and suffers, because the "free" he is always racking his brains to think about how he can complete his life's path, and he is also waiting in terror for the future death. From this, the conclusion can be drawn: Do whatever you want, and do not bother your mind with questions such as "what kind of behavior is reasonable"; the "freedom" that drives people to consider such questions is "entangling" people. The existentialists then arbitrarily say that there is no such thing as morality other than what is considered appropriate by this or that subject.

    In the existentialists' discourse on human "freedom," there is no humanism at all. Even the existentialists themselves have to admit this. No wonder Jaspers said when talking about the great German humanist Goethe that he was "not an example to imitate." Yes, what humanism can existentialists actually talk about? Existentialists advocate distrust of human power and propagate non-moralism, which is in principle opposed to humanism. All of this only conforms to the class interests and wishes of the modern reactionary bourgeoisie.

    True humanism is inherent in the glorious revolutionary democrats of the past: Chernyshevsky, Botev, Markovic, Sun Yat-sen, and others. The great teachers of the proletariat, Marx, Engels, and Lenin, showed immortal examples of selfless struggle for the happiness of ordinary people, the bright future of all working people, and communism. The great Soviet writer Gorky said, "Man, this is a title worthy of pride." If a person is separated from society and from the current problems of society, then his life loses its meaning. If a person's life is connected with the fate of the progressive class and dedicates it to the struggle for the happiness of progressive mankind and the ideals of bright humanism, then his life is meaningful and profound.

    Here a question arises: Why is this existentialist philosophy, which is abhorrent to all healthy people, popular in many countries and gaining its supporters?

    The social basis of this philosophy is certain groups of the imperialist bourgeoisie, who feel their inevitable death and use philosophy to justify their unprincipled, anti-people policies. Kierkegaard once said at that time: "One person cannot be anything but an obstacle to another." And the imperialist thinkers are also sure of this. Existentialist philosophy also receives a certain sympathy among some petty bourgeois strata that are devastated and tortured by modern capitalism and see no way out of the current predicament.

    Existentialist philosophy is very suitable for the tastes of those politicians who promote giving up their country's independence and abandoning national sovereignty in various ways. Experience shows that it is precisely those West German bourgeois groups who please American politicians who are extremely sympathetic to existentialism. Since honor, pride, dignity, and responsibility are all insignificant, as the existentialists assert, then there is no need to be surprised that West Germany is dragged into a military group that violates its own vital interests. It seems that the only thing worth bothering about is one's own pocketbook. In this way, the non-moral ethics advocated by the existentialists turns out to be the weapon of modern bourgeois cosmopolitan romantic poets.

    Another question is also worth explaining: What attitude does the most powerful school in bourgeois philosophy, Catholic philosophy, take towards existentialism?

    Generally speaking, Roman Catholic philosophers and Thomists take a two-pronged attitude towards existentialism: on the one hand, Thomists certainly cannot agree with the existentialists—atheists' denial of God. Because the existentialists say that there is nothing sacred and nothing definite, neither God nor matter. The Thomists cannot tolerate this kind of thinking, because this kind of thinking contradicts the Thomists' teachings.

    Nevertheless, existentialists still receive the support of Catholic thinkers. The problem lies in the fact that the pessimism that existentialists propagate in the newspapers is beneficial to the Catholic Church and its philosophy. Catholic thinkers hope that this idea of the meaninglessness of human existence and absolute pessimism, if spread among the masses, will cause people to turn to religion, that is, to the Church, in despair. Therefore, the thinkers and politicians of the Vatican believe that it is beneficial to them since the existentialists want to make people ideologically accept the Catholic worldview.

    Therefore, the Catholic Church usually has a good impression of existentialists, and sometimes Catholic thinkers openly express that the fragility of life advocated by existentialists is completely acceptable to the Catholic worldview, and is still an integral part of it. The alliance between these two factions of bourgeois philosophy is undoubtedly the result of the consistency of the class interests of their main representatives.

    Existentialism is one of the most reactionary philosophical factions in the capitalist world of Western Europe today. It is not without reason that progressive scholars from France, Austria, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and other countries have launched criticisms of this bourgeois philosophy.

    The struggle of Marxist philosophers and all progressive scholars against existentialism is an important and urgent task.

    为垄断资本服务的生存主义哲学
    伊·斯·纳尔斯基
    在现代资产阶级哲学中，经常笼罩着大部分资产阶级知识分子的悲观主义心理得到了广泛的传播。颓废情绪和悲观主义在生存主义哲学中表现得最明显，同语义学唯心主义和天主教哲学一样，生存主义是我们这个时代最流行的资产阶级哲学思潮之一。它在西欧各国有根深蒂固的基础。这一思潮恰好发生在第二次世界大战时期处于希特勒铁蹄下的法国资产阶级知识分子中间，绝不是偶然的。同样，也不能认为第二次世界大战结束后最初几年这一思潮在西德的特别流行是一种偶然的现象。
    生存主义的主要代表，在德国是卡尔·雅斯贝尔斯和马丁·海德格尔，在法国是密劳—庞齐和卡缪兹。
    基督教生存主义是生存主义的一个变种，它同天主教哲学相近，实际上已同后者结合起来。在法国，这个学派以著名的反动哲学家哈伯莱·马赛尔为代表，他是关于“精神生活本质的研究”和“存在和占有”两书的作者。
    生存主义者把夏林·克尔凯郭尔称为他们的先驱。这位克尔凯郭尔是十九世纪丹麦的一位哲学家，死在疯人院里。在克尔凯郭尔的著作中反复论述的一个主题就是：死和死的期待，死的恐惧，死的挣扎等等。目前，他的著作为反动的资产阶级报刊所大肆吹捧。克尔凯郭尔已被看成是生存主义的“先知”，是提出生存主义思想的第一个哲学家，而德国反动的唯心主义哲学家尼采则被指为生存主义的第二个“先知”。
    生存主义者为了博得群众的拥护，竭力利用俄国的伟大作家陀思妥也夫斯基著作中某些错误的和反动的思想。
    生存主义哲学究竟是一种什么东西，它宣传什么，主张什么，教给它的弟子和信徒的又是些什么呢？
      一、生存主义者对死亡的鼓吹
    生存主义哲学的第一个命题是：“个人生存”是哲学的对象。这是生存主义者其他一切论断的出发前提。自然和社会发展的客观规律并不使他们感到兴趣，他们所注意的只是主观心理世界和它的内在感受。著名的生存主义者之一雅斯贝尔斯，曾做过多年的精神病专科医生，这方面的许多专门著作都出之于他的手笔。值得注意的是，生存主义者所研究的实际上仅限于病人的心理；他们不注意健康的、心理平衡的人，却注意有病态心理和意志销沉的人。
    生存主义者的其次一个命题是：人的生存并没有哲学中所谓本质作为它的基础。生存主义者说：“生存先于本质”。由此就产生了这个哲学学派的称号“生存的哲学”。
    一切的哲学学派都总是要解决一个基本的哲学问题，即何者是第一性的：是存在还是意识。生存主义者按照他们自己的方式解决这个哲学的基本问题，但是他们同时伪造了问题的提法。他们以先有“生存”呢还是先有“本质”这样一个含混的、纠缠不清的问题来代替上述的基本哲学问题的提法。
    生存主义者的所谓“生存”就是指主观的直觉和感受。他们认为属于“生存”这个范畴的有：感觉、愉快和不愉快的心情、满足和不满足的情绪、悲伤、愤怒、踌躇等等。这些都是个人的内心世界。但是生存主义者首先把“生存”归结为情绪。他们并不把人看做是社会的存在物，而仅看做是个人感受的特别的凝结物。生存主义者以变化着的主观心理状态过程来代替物体、事件和过程的客观存在。
    生存主义者所谓的“本质”又是指什么呢？在上面所研究的问题中本质被理解为：人的存在似乎是从某种纯属偶然的、任意的东西变成现象的总和，这种总和带有一定的合乎规律的性质，并具有一定的内容和使自己发生的原因。人的心理生活现象仿佛就是人的生存的本质的透露。
    生存主义者硬说，生存没有本质，而且先于本质，这也就是说，人的内心世界所发生的一切，其中发生的一切变化，心情的更替等等——所有这一切似乎都只带有纯属偶然的无意义的性质。所有这些变化似乎都没有任何外在的客观原因。关于这一点，曾有一个生存主义者宣称：我们的降生缺乏任何原因和任何意义，也正像我们的死亡那样荒谬。
    因此，关于生存没有本质的论题，也就是断言人的生存是没有意义的。
    每个人都可以看出，这种哲学是极端颓废的，它削弱人民群众的力量和毅力。如果在生活中真没有任何确定的、本质的东西，一切都是偶然的、无意义的、愚蠢的，那么请问，人是否值得生活下去？而生存主义者的答复是：人的生活就是一种自相矛盾，对于这种矛盾可以这样说，如果没有他，倒会好得多。
    生存主义者声称，人是被“扔到”或“丢到”世界上来的。究竟是被谁、是被那种力量扔到世界上来的呢？基督教生存主义者，像哈伯莱·马赛尔以及和他抱同样见解的人是这样来回答这个问题的：“是上帝把人‘扔到’世界上来，然后让他孤单地留在那里”。
    所以，人是孤独无靠地对付这个他所感受的世界的。而人的主要感受，他的全部心情的主调，根据生存主义者的说法，这就是孤独的恐惧和对死的害怕。雅斯贝尔斯说，人的生存充满了“焦虑”、“惊慌”和“怕死”。这种论调是对正常的、健康的人的污蔑。
    进步阶级的思想家曾一直指出，沸腾着生命力的乐观主义是一个健康人所固有的。十七世纪荷兰的伟大唯物主义者斯宾诺莎早就说过，一个自由的人想得最少的莫过于死亡。伟大的俄国革命民主主义者赫尔岑曾狂喜地谈到那照耀着争取人民的幸福的战士所走的艰难而光荣的道路的生气勃勃的乐观主义。他说：“人并不是为命运所掌握的听任摆布的小卒，而是他自己的未来的创造者。”
    工人阶级的天才导师和领袖马克思、恩格斯和列宁曾屡次强调指出，无产阶级所固有的特点就是对未来的深刻信念，无穷的积极性，争取劳动人民解放斗争胜利的意志，以及对生活的热爱。革命的工人阶级在争取社会主义、建设共产主义社会、创造新的生活方式的斗争中全面地表现了所有这些特点。
    生存主义者不能避而不谈主观同客观世界的关系问题。但他们是否承认客观的物质世界的存在呢？决不承认。生存主义者也常常谈到“客体”，可是，在他们看来，客体是一种恶毒的力量，它闯入人的内心世界，破坏这个世界的平静，使它充满了“不安”。
    生存主义者说，我们的全部生活是走向死亡的道路。死亡究竟会带来什么呢？死亡会使我们摆脱生存。死后，人就过渡到一个无知觉的空无的领域。而这个“空无”，生存主义者肯定说，就是世界的真正本质。
    因此，这种反动的哲学实际上是否认客观现实。
    二、关于生存主义者臆造的辩证法以及这种辩证法把人们引向何处。
    人是否能认识世界？对这一问题的答复可揭示出生存主义哲学的很多方面。生存主义者对这个问题的答复是否定的。此外，他们还在本质和现象、绝对真理和相对真理的辩证关系上进行投机，他们宣称：认识乃是像小猫追逐自己的尾巴那样的东西。认识真理，这仿佛是捕捉一只人所永远捉不到的鸟，虽则在这个人看来，这只鸟好像就要落到他的手里了。他们说：要知道所谓认识也就是确定什么是现象的本质。这也就是说，要在那外表乱七八糟的、难于理解的事件的混乱状态中去发现主导线索，发现决定这些事件的规律，发现原因和结果的合乎规律的链条。但是，生存主义者说，由于本质就是“空无”，因此，为要理解本质，人就必须同自己的生命告别而投到这个“空无”的领域中去，换句话说，就是用自杀来结束生命。生存主义者们还郑重其事地写道，认识真理的最好的途径似乎就是自杀。例如，雅斯贝尔斯说，
  “只有处于临界的景况下才能有真正的认识。”所谓“临界的景况”是什么呢？这是指生和死之间的境界，换句话说，就是只有在濒临死亡的边界上才能有认识。雅斯贝尔斯接着又说：“在自杀的瞬间所得到的经验是非常有意义的。”
    在几年以前苏联“真理报”上刊载的一篇文章中，曾非常准确地把生存主义者称为“阴曹地府的先生们”。的确，这是些“阴曹地府的先生”，他们鼓吹死亡、召唤人们去死。从他们的哲学中可以闻到死尸的气味，腐朽的气息。
    生存主义的哲学敌视理智和科学。生存主义轻视自然科学和社会学，否认自然和社会发展的客观规律的存在，否认认识和适当利用这些规律的可能性。
    生存主义者，特别是在西德的生存主义者，常常宣称，他们是十九世纪德国古典唯心主义代表所创造的辩证法的继承人。大家知道，这种辩证法虽有唯心主义的性质，但仍有它的进步作用。可是生存主义者的“辩证法”和黑格尔的辩证法是原则上不同的；至于同真正科学的马克思主义的唯物主义辩证法则相距更远了。生存主义者所谈的是一种所谓
  “悲剧的辩证法”。他们的哲学中的极端悲观主义在这个“悲剧的辩证法”学说中以扩大的形式表现出来。“悲剧的辩证法”的思想实质可以归结如下：人的世界充满了内在矛盾；这些矛盾是不能解决的，它们互相冲突，而冲突的结果使个人遭到悲剧性的死亡。
    这样，生存主义者就把辩证法局限在个人意识范围之内。所得到的就不是客观世界的活生生的辩证法，而是个人的各种感受的冲突的特殊的图式。同时，按照生存主义者的说法，矛盾冲突的结果，并不是前进，而是不可避免的毁灭，一切运动的终止。
    列宁在他的“哲学笔记”中指出，对立物的“斗争”带有客观的、不以主观为转移的性质，并且是发展和进步的源泉。把对立看作是发展的源泉，使我们能从现象的“活生生的”生命中去认识现象。只有它才提供理解一切存在物的“自己运动”的钥匙，只有它才提供理解“飞跃”、“渐进过程的中断”“旧东西的灭亡和新东西的产生”的钥匙。
    至于生存主义者的辩证法却完全不是辩证法，这是一种形而上学的学说，具有主观唯心主义的性质。生存主义的目的全在于：使劳动者迷失方向，使他们彼此隔绝，消灭无产阶级的阶级自觉，要他们不把自己的阶级敌人看做是自己的反对者，而看做是在迎接死亡的毫无意义的旅途中的伙伴。生存主义的泰斗之一雅斯贝尔斯说：“研究哲理，也就是学习死亡”，这不是偶然的。
    这里有一个疑问：这种自杀哲学是否仅仅为悲观主义找理论根据，仅仅宣传人要听天由命，不要去进行斗争呢？不，问题还不仅如此。
    上面已经指出，生存主义反映了一种颓废心理，这种心理笼罩了现代帝国主义资产阶级集团以及跟随他们走的一部分小资产阶级。生存主义者企图使劳动人民厌恶自己。但是，不要忘记，生存主义的哲学也以它所固有的特殊形式反映了一种为最具有侵略性的帝国主义分子集团所固有的好战意图。在这方面，西德类型的生存主义首先就是一个鲜明例子。
    譬如，雅斯贝尔斯说，一个人所能经受的最大满足就是“像士兵那样的死亡”。这样，雅斯贝尔斯就在宣扬一种反动的思想——战死的渴望，这个思想正由西德垄断资本的头子们利用来制造炮灰。这种“思想”也是现在在德意志联邦共和国中所建立的、作为新国防军的各个师的人员的一种思想教育。雅斯贝尔斯甚至还为亲美的政治家们所宣传的军事和经济的“欧洲共同性”创造“哲学基础”。他正在竭力从“日耳曼精神的深处”，引伸出这种“共同性”。
    雅斯贝尔斯在“关于历史的起源和目的”一书中曾谈到他所臆造的东方国家的人民对西欧的“进攻”，并不安地指出了人民群众日益增长的积极性。这种议论也是有利于帝国主义分子的，因为他们早就在用臭名昭著的“东方国家的威胁”来吓唬人们，以便使西欧各国人民陷于神经质和战争歇斯底里的状态。
    这样，宣传生存主义就不仅在鼓吹悲观主义和颓废情绪，而且还在颂扬军国主义和“军人魂”。从这里不难看出生存主义对垄断资本的效忠。
    三、生存主义的反动伦理学
    对于生存主义的伦理也不能不谈一下。以生存主义者的道德学说为例，可以最令人信服地说明，现代资产阶级的哲学充满着非道德主义的精神。因为如果说生命是一种愚蠢的幻境和废话，那么由此就可得出结论说：没有也不可能有任何一定的客观道德标准，没有也不可能有任何个人行为的确定准则。仿佛一个人对自己的阶级、家庭、亲人以及对任何人（其中包括他自己）都可以不负任何责任。法国的生存主义者密劳—庞齐写道，谁都从来没有“看见过阶级”，这就是说，在对待阶级的关系上不可能有任何的义务。人对于自己和旁人都是随心所欲的，他对谁也没有什么责任。这就是生存主义伦理学的基本论题之一。这种伦理学是为背叛、变节行为以及各种不道德的罪行作辩护的。
    生存主义者声称他们是“人道主义者”，因为他们是争取人的“自由”的战士。但是，请问，他们把什么看做人的“自由”？他们把一个人不负任何义务，换句话说，就是把这个人的精神上的放荡，看做是自由。我们在生存主义者那里可以发现这样奇怪的话：“人是被注定要自由的”。用“注定”这个字眼，是因为在生存主义者看来，自由是一种灾难。他们认为只有当一个人“不自由”的时候，当他绝对不能安置自己（即死亡）的时候，他才是幸福的。而在他活着的时候，他很不幸，受折磨，受苦难，因为“自由”的他老在绞尽脑汁地想，他如何来走完自己的生命的道路，并且还要恐怖地等待着未来的死亡。由此就可以得出这样的结论：随心所欲地干吧，不要用“怎样的行为才算合理”这类问题来麻烦自己的头脑；驱使人们去考虑这类问题的“自由”，在“纠缠”着人。生存主义者接着武断地说，除了为这样或那样的主观所认为是合适的东西以外，不存在任何的所谓道德。
    在生存主义者关于人的“自由”的论述中，丝毫没有人道主义。这一点就连生存主义者自己也不得不承认。无怪雅斯贝尔斯在谈到伟大的德国人道主义者歌德时说道，他“不是一个模仿的榜样”。是的，在实际上生存主义者又能谈得上什么人道主义呢？生存主义者提倡对人的力量的不信任和宣传非道德主义，这在原则上是同人道主义对立的。所有这一切仅仅符合现代反动资产阶级的阶级利益和愿望。
    真正的人道主义是过去的光荣的革命民主主义者：车尔尼雪夫斯基、波特夫、马尔柯维奇、孙逸仙等人所固有的。无产阶级的伟大导师马克思、恩格斯和列宁显示了为普通人民的幸福、全体劳动者的光明未来和共产主义而进行忘我斗争的不朽榜样。伟大的苏联作家高尔基说，“人，这是一个值得自豪的称呼”。如果一个人脱离社会，脱离社会的当前问题，那末他的生命就失掉了意义。一个人的生命如果同进步阶级的命运相联系，并把它献给争取进步人类的幸福、争取光明的人道主义的理想的斗争，那么他的生命就是有意义的、内容深刻的。
    这里发生一个问题：为什么这个为所有健全的人感到厌恶的生存主义哲学能在许多国家中流行，并获得自己的支持者？
    作为这个哲学的社会基础是帝国主义资产阶级的某些集团，他们感到自己必然死亡，就利用哲学来为自己的无原则的、反人民的政策作辩护。克尔凯郭尔在当时曾说过：“一个人对于别人来说，除了是一种障碍之外，不可能是别的什么。”而帝国主义的思想家也是肯定这一点的。生存主义哲学也在一部分被现代资本主义所摧残和折磨，并在现时的绝境中看不到出路的小资产阶级阶层中受到一定的同情。
    生存主义哲学非常适合那些以各种方式宣传放弃自己国家的独立，放弃民族主权的政客的口味。经验表明，正是那些讨好美国政客的西德资产阶级集团是极同情生存主义的。既然荣誉、自豪、尊严、责任，都无所谓，像生存主义者所断言的，那么西德之被拉入和它的切身利益相违反的军事集团，也就无须大惊小怪了。仿佛值得费脑筋的只是自己的口袋罢了。这样，生存主义者所鼓吹的非道德主义伦理，原来是现代资产阶级世界主义浪漫诗人的武器。
    还有一个问题也值得说明一下：资产阶级哲学中最有势力的学派之一，天主教哲学，究竟对生存主义采取怎样的态度？
    一般说来，罗马教皇的天主教哲学家、托马斯主义者对生存主义采取两面的态度：一方面，托马斯主义者当然不能同意生存主义者——无神论者否认上帝的说法。因为生存主义者说，任何神圣的、任何确定的东西都是没有的，既没有上帝，也没有物质。对于他们的这种思想，托马斯主义者是不能容忍的，因为这种思想同托马斯主义者的教义相矛盾。
    虽然如此，生存主义者仍然得到天主教思想家的支持。问题在于，生存主义者在报刊上所宣扬的悲观主义，是有利于天主教会和它的哲学的。天主教的思想家们希望，这种关于人的生存的无意义和绝对悲观主义的思想，倘能在群众中传播，就会使人们在绝望之余转而信教，即转向教会。因此，梵蒂冈的思想家和政客们认为，既然生存主义者想使人们在思想上接受天主教的世界观，那就对他们是有利的。
    因此，天主教会对生存主义者通常总是抱着好感，有时天主教的思想家还亲口公开表示，生存主义者鼓吹的生命的脆弱性，是天主教的世界观完全能接受的，并且还是它的组成部分之一。资产阶级哲学的这两个派别之所以能结成联盟，无疑是它们的主要代表的阶级利益一致的结果。
    生存主义乃是今天西欧资本主义世界中最反动的哲学派别之一。法国、奥地利、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利等国家的进步学者对这个资产阶级哲学展开批判，这不是没有原因的。
    马克思主义哲学家和所有的进步学者反对生存主义的斗争，乃是一项重要而迫切的任务。
