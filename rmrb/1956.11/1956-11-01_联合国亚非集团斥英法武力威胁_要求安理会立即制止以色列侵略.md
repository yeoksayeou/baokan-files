Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 31st: The United Nations Asian-African group today condemned the British and French ultimatum to Egypt as "the most abhorrent re-emergence of imperialism," which will "cause far-reaching and unpredictable consequences in Asia, Africa, and elsewhere."

After the Security Council failed yesterday to take action on Egypt's protest against the British and French ultimatum, the Asian-African group of countries held a meeting. The communique issued after the meeting condemned Britain and France for using their veto power twice in one day "to obstruct the United Nations from taking action on a matter of the utmost importance to international peace and security" "for selfish interests and political purposes." The communique said that the actions of Britain and France, as well as their ultimatum to Egypt, "will surely cause the most serious repercussions in Asia and Africa," and that "the Asian-African group considers this ultimatum to be completely unjustified and a blatant violation of the principles and purposes of the Charter." The communique concluded, "The Asian-African group will urge Britain and France not to use the threat of force contained in the ultimatum."

Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 31st: The United Nations Asian-African group of countries issued a statement after holding an emergency meeting on October 30, demanding that the Security Council immediately take effective action to stop Israel's aggression against Egypt.

    联合国亚非集团斥英法武力威胁
    要求安理会立即制止以色列侵略
    新华社31日讯　纽约消息：联合国亚非集团今天斥责英、法给埃及的最后通牒是“帝国主义最令人厌恶的再发作”，它一定会“在亚洲、非洲和其他地方引起深远的、难以逆料的后果”。
    在安全理事会昨天未能就埃及对英、法最后通牒的抗议采取行动以后，亚非集团国家举行了会议。会后发表的公报谴责英、法“为了自私的利益和政治目的”，在一天内两次使用否决权“阻挠联合国在一个对国际和平和安全有最重大关系的问题上采取行动”。公报说，英、法的这种行为以及它们给埃及的最后通牒“一定会在亚洲和非洲引起最严重的反响”，“亚非集团认为这个最后通牒是完全没有道理的，而且是公然违犯宪章的原则和宗旨”。公报最后说，“亚非集团将敦促英、法两国不要使用最后通牒中包含的武力威胁。”
    新华社31日讯　纽约消息：联合国亚非集团国家10月30日在举行紧急会议后发表了一个声明，要求安全理事会立即采取有效的行动来制止以色列对埃及的侵略。
