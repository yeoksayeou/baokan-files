Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 20th - The CCP Hetao District Committee of Inner Mongolia recently, based on feedback from farmers in various banners and counties, conducted a conscientious inspection and correction of the phenomena of suppressing grades and prices in local grain unified purchase. It also severely criticized the one-sided thinking of some grain procurement staff, who only considered the interests of the state and neglected the interests of the farmers, as well as their actions that violated national grain policies.

This autumn, the grain departments in the Hetao area of Inner Mongolia, without consulting with the local Party committees and governments, and based solely on the instructions of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Grain Bureau, cancelled the historical grain grading system of five grades and nine levels in the Hetao area, and adopted a five-grade purchase system. This cancellation of intermediate grain prices caused widespread dissatisfaction among farmers. Many farmers said, "The grain is the same as last year, but it can't be sold at last year's price."

Based on the opinions of the masses, the CCP Hetao District Committee organized two work teams in mid-October, which arrived at Dalate Hou Banner and Anbei, Wuyuan, and other counties to conduct in-depth inspections. During the inspection, the work teams found that the cancellation of intermediate grain prices caused farmers to suffer a significant loss in income compared to last year; and they also found that some banners and counties raised the standards of grain samples and purchased at low prices and transferred grain at high prices, violating grain policies, which also affected farmers' income. Many of the grain samples displayed in Anbei and Wuyuan counties had grades that were raised to varying degrees compared to the standards stipulated by the state. In Anbei County, where grain work was relatively chaotic, some grain depots even violated national grain policies this year, mixing the purchased substandard grain with fourth and fifth-grade grain, and submitted it as a higher grade. This county also promoted this erroneous practice as an experience in handling substandard grain.

The rude attitude of the grain procurement staff towards the farmers and their unwillingness to listen to the opinions of the masses also caused much trouble for the farmers. In Dalate Hou Banner, after a procurement staff member lowered the grade of a farmer's grain, and the farmer raised an objection, he said impatiently, "If you want to sell, sell it; if you don't want to sell it, take it back!"

After discovering these problems, the CCP Hetao District Committee and the administrative region's grain department, in addition to obtaining the consent of the Autonomous Region Grain Bureau and ordering the grain departments of all banners and counties to immediately restore the intermediate grain prices, also required grain staff at all levels to deeply examine their own capitalist thinking and strictly correct all forms of suppressing grades and prices and bureaucratic work styles. For the irrational grade and price phenomena that have already occurred, they will be properly handled in accordance with the grain policy. At present, in places where the grain unified purchase work has been improved, farmers are actively selling surplus grain to the state.

### 购粮不许压级压价  中共河套地委纠正部分工作人员在购粮工作中的错误

    购粮不许压级压价
    中共河套地委纠正部分工作人员在购粮工作中的错误
    新华社呼和浩特20日电　中共内蒙古河套地方委员会最近根据各旗、县农民的反映，对当地粮食统购中的压等压价现象进行了认真的检查和纠正工作，并对一部分粮食工作人员的只顾国家利益、忽视农民利益的片面思想和违犯国家粮食政策的行为进行了严正的批判。
    今年秋天，内蒙古河套地区的粮食部门，没有同当地党委和政府研究，即根据内蒙古自治区粮食厅的指示，就取消河套地区历年来的粮食五等九级的收购办法，采用了五等收购办法。这个取消粮食中间价格的做法，引起了农民普遍不满。不少农民说：“和去年一样的粮食，但是卖不上去年的价了。”
    中共河套地委根据群众意见，在10月中旬组织了两个工作组，分别到达拉特后旗和安北、五原等县，进行深入的检查。在检查中，工作组发现取消粮食中间价格，使农民的收入比去年受到了许多损失；并发现有些旗、县提高粮食样品的标准和低价收购，高价上调等违犯粮食政策的现象，也影响了农民收入。安北和五原两县陈列的粮食样品中有不少等级都比国家规定的标准有不同程度的提高。在粮食工作比较混乱的安北县，有的粮库今年竟然违犯国家的粮食政策，将收购的等外粮和四、五等粮混存在一起，提高了粮食等级上交。这个县还把这种错误的做法，作为处理等外粮的经验，予以推广。
    对农民态度生硬和不虚心听取群众意见的粮食收购工作人员，也给农民带来许多烦恼。达拉特后旗一个收购工作人员因压低了农民的粮食等级，农民提出意见后，他不耐烦地说：“你卖就卖，不卖就拉回去！”
    中共河套地委和行政区粮食部门发现这些问题后，除了征得自治区粮食厅的同意，责令各旗、县粮食部门迅即恢复粮食的中间价格以外，并要求各级粮食工作人员深入检查自己的资本主义思想，严格纠正各种形式的压等压价现象和官僚主义作风。对于已经发生的等级、价格不合理现象，将依据粮食政策妥善处理。目前，在改善了粮食统购工作的地方，农民已积极把余粮卖给国家。
