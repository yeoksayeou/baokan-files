A common characteristic of subjectivists is that they don't trust others and only believe in themselves. Anyone who opposes them can be readily labeled; they are either conservative or rash, either leftist or rightist. Ai Shangzhu, a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Taishan County Committee in Guangdong Province, head of the Fisheries Department, and concurrently the Party Secretary of the Nanwan District, is a typical example. This spring, when launching the large-scale fisheries production campaign, he demanded that fishermen weave a large fishing net to block the eighteen-li estuary and catch all the fish schools passing through the sea. He did not consult with the county committee on this plan, nor did he discuss it at the district committee meeting, nor did he fully deliberate it among the masses, but ordered its implementation with the Red Star Fishery Cooperative as the key focus. As soon as this proposal was put forward, some cooperative cadres opposed it, believing that the net was too large, would be too heavy to pull through the water, and would not be able to catch fish. Ai Shangzhu not only did not seriously consider this correct opinion, but also criticized those who raised objections as "backward, right-leaning conservatives." As a result, the fishermen spent more than 14,000 workdays weaving a large fishing net that was more than 26,000 feet long, 35 feet high, and weighed more than 33,000 jin. As it turned out, because the net line was thick, the mesh was fine, the resistance was great, and the movement was inconvenient, the fish schools had already fled before the net was even pulled up. In one month, it went to sea seven times, and the total value of the fish caught was only more than 400 yuan, while the gasoline and glass floats consumed in fishing cost more than 1,700 yuan. As a result, the production of many fishery cooperatives was greatly reduced, and the losses of the key cooperative, the Red Star Fishery Cooperative, were particularly serious. According to calculations, the entire cooperative was already in debt of more than 70,000 yuan, with an average debt of more than 400 yuan per laborer.

Ai Shangzhu's subjectivism not only cannot tolerate different opinions from others, but also completely ignores objective practice. When he learned that he had failed four times after going out to sea four times, he did not conduct any analysis or research on the reasons for the failure, nor did he consider whether there was anything wrong with his own subjective wishes. He simply attributed the failure to the wavering thoughts of the cooperative cadres, and therefore he wanted to conduct ideological rectification of the members. In this way, Ai Shangzhu placed himself in a position of refusing to accept any help to correct his mistakes, and hopelessly sank into the abyss of subjectivist error.

If it is said that Ai Shangzhu had bad intentions or improper motives, that would be unfair. He had such good ideas! A large net would block the estuary, catching all the fish in one net, greatly developing fisheries production, and greatly improving the lives of fishermen. However, for subjectivists, this kind of unrealistic wish often backfires. Good things are done badly by them, and good wishes are exchanged for bad results. This is the tragedy of subjectivists.

Ai Shangzhu's subjectivism harmed both others and himself. He harmed so many fishermen that they reduced production and went into debt, and he also harmed himself by being removed from his position. Everyone who has committed subjectivist errors should take this as a warning.

    三万斤重的大鱼网
    主观主义者有一个共同的特点，就是不相信别人，只相信自己。谁要反对他，帽子随时可以扣下来，不是保守，就是冒进，不是左倾，就是右倾。中共广东省台山县委员会委员，渔业部长、兼南湾区区委书记艾尚著，就是一个典型人物。今年春天，在开展渔业大生产运动的时候，他要渔民编织一种大鱼网，把十八里的海口拦起来，把过海的鱼群一网打尽。这个计划，他既没有向县委请示，也没有在区委会上讨论，更没有在群众中进行充分酝酿，就以红星渔业社为重点命令执行。这个主张一提出，有的社干部就反对，认为网太大，吃水流力也大，不能捉鱼，这个正确的意见，艾尚著不但没有认真加以考虑，反而批评提反对意见的人是“落后，右倾保守”。于是渔民花了一万四千多个劳动日，编织了一张二万六千多尺长、三十五尺高、三万三千多斤重的大鱼网。结果因为网线粗，网眼细，阻力很大，动作不便，网还没有拉起，鱼群已经跑光。一个月中间，七次下海，捕鱼所得总值只有四百多元，而捕鱼损耗的汽油和玻璃浮子就折合一千七百多元。以致不少渔业合作社大大减产，重点社红星渔业合作社损失尤其严重。据计算，全社已经负债七万多元，平均每个劳动力负债四百多元。
    艾尚著的主观主义不仅不能容纳别人不同的意见，也十分忽视客观的实践。当他知道四次出海四次失败之后，他没有对失败的原因进行任何分析研究，也没有考虑自己的主观愿望有什么错误，只是仅仅把失败归之于社干部的思想动摇，因而他还要对社员进行思想整顿。这样一来，艾尚著就把自己放在拒绝接受一切帮助他改正错误的地位，无可救药地向主观主义错误的深渊陷了进去。
    如果说艾尚著的存心不良，动机不善，那也是冤枉的。他想得多好啊！大网拦住海口，一网把鱼打尽，渔业生产大发展，渔民生活大改善。可是，这种不切实际的愿望，对主观主义者来说，常常是事与愿违。很好的事被他们办得很坏，很好的愿望换来的是很坏的结果。主观主义者的悲剧就在这里。
    艾尚著的主观主义既害了别人，也害了自己，他害得多少渔民减了产，负了债，也害得他自己被撤消了职务。一切犯有主观主义错误的人，都应该引此为戒。
