    "What Constitutes a Major Issue?"
    Niè Méi
    “What constitutes a major issue?” Many enterprise leaders are now asking the higher-level Party committees for a clear answer as soon as possible. They say that otherwise, it is difficult to implement the system of collective leadership with individual responsibility. On the factory director's side, they feel that some issues do not count as "major" and do not need to be submitted to the Party committee for discussion. However, decisions made individually are not necessarily correct, and if something goes wrong and the masses have complaints, a small problem becomes a big problem. At that time, they will inevitably be labeled as "disrespecting the Party committee" and accused of resisting the Party committee's system of collective leadership. To avoid this possibility, some factory directors submit everything to the Party committee for discussion, regardless of how trivial. On the Party committee secretary's side, they are equally troubled: if they say these are minor issues and the Party committee doesn't discuss them, they cannot avoid self-criticism for abandoning their leadership responsibility if something goes wrong. If they do discuss them, the Party committee will fall into a circle of bureaucratic busywork, spending all day in meetings, and will likely be criticized for "the Party committee taking over everything."

    What to do? These comrades naturally found the best way out: ask the higher-level authorities to define the scope, specifying which issues should be discussed by the Party committee and which can be avoided. This way, they can follow established procedures and no one will make mistakes.

    It is necessary to stipulate a basic scope, suggesting which types of issues in an enterprise should be collectively discussed and decided by the Party committee. However, a principle regulation is not the same as regulations or detailed rules. It can only list a few basic scopes, such as the appointment and removal of relatively important cadres in the enterprise, the formulation of annual, quarterly, and monthly plans, important matters of reform and innovation in the enterprise, and so on. In fact, even without these regulations, everyone knows that these issues should be collectively discussed and decided. Therefore, such a regulation cannot satisfy the demands of the aforementioned comrades. According to these comrades' ideal, this regulation should be like a celestial book, all-encompassing and exhaustive. Any enterprise, any meeting, can find a basis in this book: whether it should be discussed at the Party committee meeting or not.

    Of course, such a celestial book is impossible to have. Everyone knows that the situations of different enterprises are different. The same type of thing, which should be treated as a major issue in this enterprise, may not need to be in that enterprise; which should be treated as a major issue under last year's circumstances, may not need to be this year. To solve "what constitutes a major issue," the main thing is to rely on everyone to grasp it according to the specific time, place, and conditions. Our Party has implemented the system of collective leadership in all our work, whether in the military or in local areas. However, we have not heard of any specific regulations in these areas. Our Party's experience in implementing collective leadership in these areas has been explored and accumulated in long-term practical work, and has never relied on a leading body to write a detailed document in advance to "act according to regulations."

    The key issue is that some comrades have unnecessary ideological concerns and lack the spirit to take responsibility. We do not have much experience in implementing the system of collective leadership with individual responsibility in enterprises, and of course, there will inevitably be negligence and wavering in the specific implementation process. At this time, we should still adopt a collective research attitude: if the Party committee discusses too many specific matters, we should study which ones can be reduced; if a problem arises from a decision made by the factory director, we should study why it went wrong and how such problems should be handled in the future, and whether they need to be collectively discussed and decided. In oneself, do not consider personal gains or losses; towards others, do not demand perfection. In this way, the system of collective leadership with individual responsibility can be smoothly promoted.

    “什么是重大问题”
    涅眉
    “什么是重大问题？”现在有不少企业的领导人员都要求上级党委早一点给一个明确的答案。他们说，要不然，实行集体领导分工负责的制度就很为难。在厂长这方面，觉得有些问题不算“重大”，可以不提交党委讨论。但是，个人决定的问题不一定都正确，如果出了毛病，群众有了意见，小问题就变成了大问题，那时候，就免不了要被戴上一顶“不尊重党委”的帽子，说自己对党委集体领导制度有抗拒情绪。为了避免这种可能，于是有的厂长就事无巨细，什么都提交党委讨论。在党委书记这方面呢，也同样为难：说这些是小问题，党委不讨论吧，万一出了岔子，就不能不检讨党委放弃了领导责任。讨论吧，党委就会陷入成天开会的事务主义圈子，并且多半还要受到“党委包办代替”的批评。
    怎么办呢？这些同志自然而然地找到了一个最好的出路：请上级给画个范围，哪些问题要党委讨论，哪些可以不讨论。这样，有据可查，照章办事，就谁也不会犯错误了。
    规定一个基本范围，提示企业那一类的问题应该由党委集体讨论决定，这是需要的。然而，原则规定并不等于条例、细则。它只能列出几条基本的范围，例如企业中比较重要的干部的任免，年度、季度、月度计划的拟订，企业中重要的应兴应革的事项等等。这些问题，其实不规定，大家也知道是应该集体讨论决定的。因此，这样一个规定不能满足上述那些同志的要求。按照这些同志的理想，这个规定应当像一部天书那样，包罗万象，详尽无遗。任何一个企业，任何一次会议，都可以在这本书上找到根据：应该在党委会上讨论呢，或者可以不讨论。
    当然，这样的天书是不可能有的。大家都知道，各个企业的情况各不相同。同样性质的事情，在这个企业里应该作为重大问题来处理，在那个企业就不一定需要；在去年的情况下应该作为重大问题处理，在今年就不一定需要。要解决“什么是重大问题”，主要的还是要根据具体的时间、地点、条件，靠大家自己来掌握。我们的党在任何工作中，无论是军队里、地方上，都是实行集体领导制度的。然而，我们并没有听到过在这些方面有过什么具体条例。我们党在这些方面实行集体领导的经验，都是在长期的实际工作中摸索、积累起来的，从来没有依靠那一个领导机关事先写出一本详尽的文件来“照章行事”。
    关键问题在于有些同志存在着不必要的思想顾虑，缺乏勇于负责的精神。我们在企业里实行集体领导分工负责制度的经验不多，当然在具体推行的过程中就难免有疏忽、摇摆。在这种时候，仍然应当采取集体研究的态度：党委讨论的具体事务太多了，就研究可以减少那些；厂长个人决定的某个问题出了毛病，就研究为什么会搞错，以后这类问题应该怎样处理，是不是需要集体讨论决定。在自己，不考虑个人得失；对别人，不求全责备。这样，集体领导分工负责制度才能顺利地推行开来。
