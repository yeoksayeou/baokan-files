    Fragmentary Recollections of the Ninetieth Anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth
    Ma Xulun
    Fifty years ago, I saw a Shanghai daily newspaper (probably the Shen Bao) publish a news item about a wanted man named "Sun Wen." At that time, I didn't know who "Sun Wen" was or why he was wanted. The teacher told me: he committed the heinous crime of rebellion. The teacher also told me: the character "Wen" should be replaced with "汶" (Wèn), because the character "文" (Wén) should not be used in the name of a rebel; according to custom, a water radical is added to it. At that time, I didn't ask him what heinous crime of rebellion he had committed. Later, I entered a new-style school (actually a semi-new-style one), and I learned from a teacher named Chen Fuchen that Mr. Sun Wen was from Guangdong and advocated overthrowing the Qing Dynasty. By this time, I had learned the meaning of revolution from Teacher Chen, and I also learned from Teacher Chen that another person from my hometown, Mr. Zhang Binglin, was also a revolutionary. I admired them both very much, and it can be said that my dedication to the revolutionary cause was inspired by them both. Of course, Mr. Sun Yat-sen inspired me even more, because Mr. Zhang Binglin was purely a nationalist revolutionary whose goal was only to overthrow the Qing Dynasty; Mr. Sun Yat-sen emphasized democratic revolution, and naturally he could not expect the Qing Dynasty to accept democratic politics, so it necessarily included overthrowing the Qing Dynasty.

    I recall that in 1924 (the year Mr. Sun Yat-sen went to Beijing), after Yuan Shikai's reactionary system split, the struggle between Xu Shichang and Duan Qirui, two senior military and civilian officials, was intense; I personally heard Duan Qirui say that Juren (Xu Shichang's courtesy name was Juren) was dead, and he wouldn't even send a "condolence couplet." That's how much they hated each other. After Xu Shichang was overthrown (Xu Shichang's downfall was mainly due to their internal relations), Duan Qirui had one less enemy, and he also treated Zhang Zuolin well. Zhang Zuolin gave way, and Duan Qirui seized central power. He himself believed that he was a "revolutionary," and he was unwilling to inherit the title of president (actually, he was being 'honest' and didn't "crown himself king" through a National Assembly election). He created an ancient and elegant title for the top leader – "Chief Executive." In addition to appeasing Zhang Zuolin, he also contacted the Southwest, first and foremost the Chinese Kuomintang. He invited Mr. Sun Yat-sen to Beijing to discuss important matters. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was already ill at this time, but he put the interests of the country first. He knew that Duan Qirui was just a more "refined" warlord, but because the people had suffered under the tyranny of warlords for so long, and Duan Qirui had expressed himself fairly reasonably, he agreed to Duan Qirui's invitation and came to Beijing despite his illness. His illness was already serious, and there were no airplanes at that time, so he had to travel north by land and water, which certainly had an impact on his health. Before Mr. Sun Yat-sen arrived in Beijing, the Kuomintang organization in Beijing had already prepared to welcome him. The people of Beijing were emotionally moved upon hearing Sun Yat-sen's name, and everyone hoped to see Mr. Sun Yat-sen. On the day Mr. Sun Yat-sen arrived in Beijing, early in the morning, the area north of the railway station all the way to Peking Union Medical College Hospital was filled with Beijing people welcoming him, especially near the station, which was so crowded that it blocked traffic. I was a welcoming member of the Party and also represented myself in welcoming Mr. Sun Yat-sen on the train. However, when I saw Mr. Sun Yat-sen sitting alone in a first-class carriage, looking very tired, I felt that at such an old age, he was still serving the people's interests despite his illness after traveling thousands of miles. How should we young people work hard to learn from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's selfless spirit? At this time, I called him "Mr." (this is how party members addressed Mr. Sun Yat-sen), and he glanced at me and nodded. Then, comrades brought a rattan lounge chair that they had hired workers on the train to get, and they carried Mr. Sun Yat-sen onto the rattan chair and then carried him off the train. Immediately, the welcoming crowd expressed their joy and sincerity with a sound that was almost like thunder. Their eyes were all fixed on Mr. Sun Yat-sen. We helped Mr. Sun Yat-sen into the prepared car and drove towards Peking Union Medical College Hospital.

    Everything in the hospital had been prepared long ago, and everything proceeded as usual, but Mr. Sun Yat-sen was suffering from a serious illness, and he was also old, so staying in the hospital temporarily could not be expected to cure him. Therefore, after staying in the hospital for one or two days, he moved to his residence in Tieshizi Hutong. The Party decided on a team to take care of him, led by Comrade Yang Xingfo. I arrived early and returned late almost every day, and I had agreed with Comrade Yang Xingfo that if there was an emergency, he would call me. Unexpectedly, I had just arrived home when he called me, and I rushed back to see that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's condition was as if he was on the verge of death. In the end, there was no way to save the life of a great man of his generation. On March 12, 1925, Mr. Sun Yat-sen left the masses of the people and us forever, but I believe that his spirit is still alive in the hearts of the Chinese people.

    When Mr. Sun Yat-sen's coffin was placed and the funeral procession took place, Duan Qirui used the excuse of "foot pain" to avoid coming, because he was afraid of the masses, because the masses' unanimous mourning for Mr. Sun Yat-sen was also an exposure and protest against the reactionary Duan Qirui regime.

    纪念孙中山先生九十岁生日片断的回忆
    马叙伦
    五十年前，我看到上海出版一份日报（大概是申报）登有通缉“孙汶”的新闻，那时我不知道“孙汶”是什么人，为什么要通缉他？老师给我说：他犯了叛逆大罪，老师还给我说：汶字应该是文字，因为“文”字不应当给叛逆犯人用作名字，照例给它加上水旁。那时，我也不再问他犯了什么叛逆大罪。后来我进了新式的学校（实在是半新式的），才从一位陈黻宸老师那里知道孙文先生是广东人，他主张推翻清朝统治的。这时候我已从陈老师那里知道革命的意义，并从陈老师那里知道还有一位我的乡人章炳麟先生也是革命家。我就对他们两位非常崇拜，可以说我的投身革命事业是被他们两位启发的。当然中山先生给我的启发更大，因为章炳麟先生是单纯的民族主义革命家，他的目的只要推翻清朝统治；中山先生重在民主革命，自然不能希望清朝统治会接受民主政治的，所以必然也包括推翻清朝统治在内。
    我回想到1924年（中山先生到北京的那一年）袁世凯的反动系统分裂后，徐世昌和段祺瑞两个文武大将的斗争是利害的；我曾经亲自听到段祺瑞说，菊人死了（徐世昌号菊人），我并“挽联”也不送一付。相恨到这种程度。在徐世昌被打倒了（徐世昌的被打倒主要是他们的内部关系），段祺瑞少了一个敌人，他对张作霖也敷衍得好，张作霖让了一步，段祺瑞就掌握了中央政权。他自己认为他是“革命”的，他不愿承袭总统的名号（其实倒是他‘老实’，不用国会选举的方式自己“封王”），自己定了一个作为最高领导的古雅名称——“执政”。他除了抚慰张作霖外，也和西南联络，首先是和中国国民党联络，他邀请孙中山先生来京商讨大事。中山先生在这时已经病了，但他是以国家利益为前提的，他明知道段祺瑞不过是较为“文气”的军阀，但他为了人民已苦军阀的蹂躏好久了，段祺瑞也表示得相当合理，所以就答应段祺瑞的邀请，扶病来京。他的病本是严重的，加上那时还没有航空的工具，还是由水陆北来，当然他的身体受到一定的影响。当中山先生到达北京之前，北京的国民党组织已筹备欢迎。北京的人民听到孙中山的名字，顿时情感激动了，大家都希望看到中山先生。中山先生到达北京的这天大早，车站以北直到协和医院，已被北京人民的欢迎队伍站满了，尤其是车站附近，拥挤得遮断了往来。我是党的一个欢迎员，也代表了自己上车欢迎中山先生。可是，我一看到中山先生一人坐在一节头等车厢里，精神非常劳顿，我就感到这样大的年纪还抱病经千里的路程来为人民利益服务，我们后生应该怎样努力学习中山先生的不见自己的精神。这时，我向他叫了一声先生（这是党员叫中山先生称呼），他也向我望了一眼点了点头。接着就是同志们带了车上工友雇了一张藤躺椅，把中山先生抬上了藤椅，便抬了下车。顿时，欢迎的群众表示他们的高兴和诚意的声浪几如雷震。他们的目光都射向中山先生。我们把中山先生扶上了预备好的汽车，就驶向协和医院了。
    医院内早经筹备好了，一切如常进行，但是，中山先生患的是严重的病症，兼以年龄大了，所以不是暂住医院可以希望痊愈的。因此，住院一、二天就移至铁狮子胡同住宅。党里决定了杨杏佛同志领导的侍疾队伍，我是几乎每日早到晚归的，并且我早和杨杏佛同志约好，如有急事就给我电话，不想我才到家，他就来电话了，我又急忙的赶去，看到中山先生的情况已像是弥留之际了。终于无法挽回一代伟人的生命，在1925年3月12日中山先生离开了人民大众和我们而永久不见了，但是我相信他的精神还是活在中国人民的身上。
    中山先生大殓和出殡时，段祺瑞借口“脚痛”不敢到来，因为他怕群众，因为群众对中山先生的同声哀悼，也就是对反动的段祺瑞政权的揭露和抗议。
