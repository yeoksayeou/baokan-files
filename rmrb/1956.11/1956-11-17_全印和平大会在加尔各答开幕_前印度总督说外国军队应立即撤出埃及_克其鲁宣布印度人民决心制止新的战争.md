Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 16th: The All-India Peace Conference, under the auspices of the All-India Peace Council, opened in Calcutta on the 15th. The conference was attended by 1,500 delegates from various states of India, representatives from China, Ceylon, Pakistan, Britain, and New Zealand, as well as approximately 7,000 people from Calcutta.

    The former Governor-General of India, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, delivered the opening address. Speaking on the situation in Egypt, he said: "A mere ceasefire is not enough. An unjust peace is not peace. Egypt must be treated fairly, which means that foreign troops should withdraw from Egypt immediately."

    The conference was chaired by Saifuddin Kitchlew, President of the All-India Peace Council. On behalf of the conference, he announced the determination of the Indian people to prevent the forces of war from pushing the world to the brink of another world war. He said: "The danger of a world war breaking out is indeed great, but we are certain that a united India, together with the people of other countries around the world, is able to and will prevent the outbreak of a third world war." Referring to the recent events in Hungary, he said, "The peace movement will do everything in its power to prevent the use of the Hungarian situation to create new centers of conflict or to exacerbate international tensions." He condemned "certain people with ulterior motives for spreading propaganda smokescreens," and said that India firmly opposes the attempts by Britain and France to use the Hungarian situation to divert people's anger from their aggression against Egypt. He called for broad unity among countries in supporting peace and friendship between nations, and called on the Indian Prime Minister to unite representatives of all parties and groups to mobilize the nation to strive for peace.

    At the meeting, the famous Indian jurist Radha Binod Pal, Zheng Senyu, representative of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, Felton, Vice-Chairman of the British Peace Committee, Saralankara, the representative of Ceylon, and Ali Askad, the representative of the East Pakistan Peace Committee, all spoke.

    Congratulatory messages to the conference from Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, and Ataur Rahman, Chief Minister of East Bengal Province (Pakistan), were also read out at the meeting. The conference also sent telegrams to Prime Minister Nehru and President Nasser, respectively.
