Xinhua News Agency Report: The paper "The Guiding Significance of 'On Practice' for Teaching Theory – Also Discussing the Reactionary Nature of Pragmatist Teaching Theory," written by Jin Shurong, Director of the Education Research Section of the Education Department of Fujian Normal College, was presented for discussion at the First Scientific Symposium of Fujian Normal College, which closed on the 24th.

The paper focuses on illustrating the guiding significance of "On Practice" for revealing the essence and regularity of the teaching process. Professor Jin Shurong, based on the enlightenment of Mao Zedong's "On Practice," examines the social phenomenon of teaching within the social and historical practice of humanity. He believes that the cognitive activity of the teaching process is an inseparable stage in the social and historical process of human understanding of the objective world. He also believes that the cognitive activity of students in teaching is different from the research work of scientists; it only accepts truths that have been scientifically verified, rather than discovering new truths. Therefore, students' cognitive activities must be organized and conducted under the guidance of teachers and according to their age characteristics. When examining the general laws of human cognitive processes as manifested in teaching, he believes that teaching, like other forms of human cognitive activity, must begin with perceptual knowledge. This perceptual knowledge is composed of the teacher's language, literature in textbooks, etc. He opposes the idea that students can begin with rational knowledge in teaching. He believes that a difficult mental activity is required between rational knowledge and practice to complete the leap in the cognitive process.

The professors and experts attending the symposium believed that this paper has practical guiding significance in resolving the issue of linking theory with practice and opposing dogmatism in teaching. At the same time, many opinions were raised. Liu Mingfan, President of Fujian Normal College, pointed out that the paper emphasizes the thinking role of students and neglects the role of practice in the cognitive process, which may lead to a position of idealistic thinking supremacy.

Regarding the relationship between the laws of the cognitive process and the laws of the teaching process, Chen Kemei, Professor of Shanghai First Normal College, believes that Professor Jin Shurong's understanding of language and writing as perceptual knowledge is an insightful view. Lin Lunshan, lecturer of the Marxism-Leninism Teaching and Research Section of Fujian Normal College, also believes that it is inappropriate to completely separate the cognitive activities of students from the research work of scientists, as this will lead to dogmatism in student learning.

In addition to all teachers and senior students of Fujian Normal College, the symposium was attended by more than 1,000 people, including representatives from three universities in Fujian Province, Zhejiang and Jiangxi Normal Colleges, Shanghai First and Second Normal Colleges, Beijing and East China Normal Universities, as well as various secondary schools and relevant departments in Fujian Province.

### 福建师范学院第一次科学讨论会  讨论“实践论”对教学理论的指导意义

    福建师范学院第一次科学讨论会
    讨论“实践论”对教学理论的指导意义
    新华社讯　福建师范学院教育科教研室主任金澍荣所著的论文“实践论”对于教学理论的指导意义——兼论实用主义教学理论的反动性，在24日闭幕的福建师范学院第一次科学讨论会上提出讨论。
    论文着重说明“实践论”对揭示教学过程的本质及其规律性的指导意义。金澍荣教授根据毛泽东的“实践论”的启示，把教学这种社会现象放在人类的社会历史实践中来考察，认为教学过程的认识活动是人类认识客观世界这一社会历史过程中的一个不可分割阶段；也认为教学中学生的认识活动和科学家的研究工作不同，它只是接受已经过科学验证的真理，而不是发现新的真理，因此学生的认识活动必须在教师主导作用下、按照年龄特征来组织和进行。在考察人类认识过程的一般规律在教学中的表现时，他认为教学和人类认识活动的其他形式一样，必须从感性认识开始，这种感性认识是由教师的语言、教科书上的文学等构成的，他反对教学中学生可以从理性认识开始的说法，他认为从理性认识到实践之间要经过一段艰巨的思维活动才能完成认识过程的飞跃。
    参加讨论会的教授专家们认为这篇论文在解决教学过程中关于理论联系实际和反对教学中的教条主义有现实的指导意义，同时提出了不少意见。福建师范学院院长刘明凡指出论文强调学生的思维作用，忽视实践在认识过程中的作用，可能走上唯心主义思维至上的立场。
    关于认识过程的规律和教学过程的规律的关系问题，上海第一师范学院教授陈科美认为金澍荣教授把语言文字等理解为感性认识是精辟的见解。福建师范学院马克思列宁主义教研室讲师林仑山，他还认为把学生的认识活动和科学家的研究工作截然分开是不妥当的，这样会形成学生学习中的教条主义。
    参加这次讨论会的除福建师范学院全体教师和高年级学生外，还有福建省三所高等学校，浙江、江西师范学院、上海第一、第二师范学院、北京、华东师范大学，以及福建省各中等学校和有关部门代表共一千多人。
