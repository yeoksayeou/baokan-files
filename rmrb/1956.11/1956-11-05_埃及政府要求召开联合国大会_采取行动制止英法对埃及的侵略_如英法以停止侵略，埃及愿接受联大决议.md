Xinhua News Agency, 4th. New York, United Nations dispatch: The Egyptian government wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on November 3rd, requesting an immediate meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to take action to stop the Anglo-French illegal attacks on Egypt and the deliberate massacre of peaceful residents, disregarding the General Assembly resolution. The full text of the letter is as follows:

    The whole world recognizes the conspiratorial and unprovoked aggression against Egyptian territory carried out by the Israeli armed forces on October 29th. On October 30th, the collusion between the Israeli side and the United Kingdom and France became clear. It is evident that the Israeli attack was approved and condoned by France and the United Kingdom.

    It is equally clear that France and the United Kingdom encouraged the Israeli offensive in order to find an excuse to intervene in the region and attack and occupy Egyptian territory. The British Prime Minister's ultimatum to the Egyptian government demanded a cessation of hostilities between Egypt and Israel, the withdrawal of armed forces to ten miles from the Suez Canal, and also required the Egyptian government to agree to the occupation of Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez by French and British armed forces, which illustrates this conspiracy.

    The British ultimatum was intentionally made unacceptable to any sovereign nation. The Egyptian government exercised its right as a sovereign and independent nation and rejected the ultimatum. Despite the indignation of world opinion, the French and British governments put their ultimatum into action.

    On the evening of October 31st, the joint French and British forces began attacking the people and territory of Egypt. They launched a planned and savage air force attack on all Egyptian airports, destroying property and causing 250 casualties. The Anglo-French attack on Egypt aroused anger in public opinion everywhere and prompted the Security Council to convene an emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.

    The General Assembly passed the draft resolution proposed by the United States government by an overwhelming majority. The General Assembly's resolution called for an immediate ceasefire, demanded that Israeli troops withdraw behind the armistice line, demanded strict adherence to the provisions of the armistice agreement, called on all member states not to take any action that would delay or hinder the implementation of this resolution, and called for the reopening of the Suez Canal and the restoration of freedom of navigation in the canal.

    The resolution also requested the United Nations Secretary-General to supervise and report to the General Assembly promptly on the implementation of the resolution so that the General Assembly could take further action it deems appropriate in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

    Despite this resolution, which represents the profound conviction of the entire world, Anglo-French air raids continue, even increasing in intensity and frequency. In addition, there are reports that "Anglo-French armed forces are participating in the war against Egyptian forces in the Sinai Peninsula of Egyptian territory."

    Faced with this endless and brutal Anglo-French aggression, the Egyptian government has decided to request an immediate meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to take action it guarantees to take in order to uphold the rule of law, to stop the illegal and unprovoked attacks suffered by Egypt, and to end the deliberate massacre of peaceful residents.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. New York dispatch: The Egyptian government announced that it is willing to accept the United Nations resolution on an immediate ceasefire on the condition that the attacking forces cease their aggression.

    Egyptian Representative to the United Nations, Lutfi, said in a memorandum sent to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 2nd: "Egypt has instructed me to inform Your Excellency: The Egyptian government accepts the resolution passed by the special emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly this morning – November 2, 1956. Of course, acceptance is only possible on the condition that the resolution cannot be implemented if the attacking forces continue their aggression.”

    埃及政府要求召开联合国大会
    采取行动制止英法对埃及的侵略
    如英法以停止侵略，埃及愿接受联大决议
    新华社4日讯  纽约联合国消息：埃及政府在11月3日写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，要求立即召开联合国大会会议，以便采取行动，制止英法不顾大会决议，继续对埃及进行非法攻击和蓄意屠杀和平居民。信件全文如下：
    全世界都认识到10月29日以色列武装部队对埃及领土所进行的阴谋和无端的侵略。10月30日，以色列一方和联合王国、法国另一方之间的勾结明朗化了。显然，以色列发动攻击是法国和联合王国所赞成和纵容的。
    同样明显的是法国和联合王国鼓励以色列进攻为的是要找到借口，以便在这个地区进行干涉及攻击和占领埃及领土。联合王国首相给予埃及政府的最后通牒要求停止埃及和以色列之间的敌对行动、把武装部队撤退到离苏伊士运河十英里的地方，而且还要求埃及政府同意由法国和英国的武装部队占领塞得港、伊士美利亚和苏伊士港，这就说明了这个阴谋。
    英国的最后通牒是有意使它不能为任何一个主权国家所接受的。埃及政府行使了它作为主权和独立国家的权利而拒绝了这个最后通牒。尽管世界舆论感到愤慨，法国和英国政府还是把它们的最后通牒付诸行动了。
    10月31日晚间，法国和英国的联合部队开始进攻埃及的人民及领土。它们用空军对埃及的全部机场发动了有计划的、野蛮的进攻，破坏了财产，造成死伤达二百五十人。英法对埃及的进攻引起了各地舆论的愤怒，并且促使安全理事会召集了联合国大会的紧急会议。
    大会以压倒多数通过了美国政府所提出的决议草案。大会的决议要求立即停火，要求以色列部队撤退到停战线的后面，要求严格遵守停战协定的规定，要求一切会员国不采取任何将会拖延或者阻挠这个决议的执行的行动，以及要求重新开放苏伊士运河和恢复运河的航行自由。
    决议并要求联合国秘书长进行监督，并迅速地向大会报告执行决议的情况，以便大会可以按照联合国宪章采取它认为适当的进一步的行动。
    尽管有了这样的代表整个世界的深刻信念的决议，英法的空袭却仍旧在继续进行，在进攻的猛烈程度和次数上甚至有增无减。此外，还有消息说“英法武装部队正在埃及领土西奈半岛上参加对埃及部队的战争。
    面临着英法这种无休止的、残暴的侵略，埃及政府决定要求立即召开联合国大会会议，以便为了维护法治原则而采取它保证要采取的行动，以制止埃及所遭到的非法的、无端的攻击和结束对和平居民的蓄意的屠杀。
    新华社3日讯　纽约消息：埃及政府宣布，它愿意在进攻军队停止侵略行动的条件下，接受联合国关于立即停火的决议。
    埃及驻联合国代表卢特菲在2日送给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的一个备忘录里面说：“埃及已经指示我通知阁下：埃及政府接受今天早晨——1956年11月2日——联合国大会特别紧急会议通过的决议。当然，只能在这样的条件下接受：如果进攻军队继续它们的侵略，就不能实施这个决议。”
