A De Facto Extinct but Still Existing Organization
Wei Ming

At the end of April 1956, the Wuhan Yangtze Daily published the following advertisement, which was not long, and is copied below: "Announcement of the Wuhan Customs of the People's Republic of China: According to the instruction No. (56) Guan Gong Lin Zi 445 of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, our Customs will be abolished on May 1 of this year and will cease to handle all customs business. This is hereby announced."

It has been six months since then. However, this abolished organization still has basically all of its personnel, with a total of forty people, including the commissioner, heads of departments and offices, section chiefs, and even workers.

What are these many "cadres" "doing"? This is very thought-provoking. It turns out that they still have these tasks: First, there is "customs property" to manage, that is, the famous Wuhan Customs Building in Wuhan, which is the office building for the transportation department, foreign trade department, and agricultural product procurement department. To say that customs cadres have nothing to do would at least wrong some of them; they sometimes even have to work overtime (such as for National Day decorations)! Second, since there are people, there is of course "personnel" to manage, and not doing work is not the fault of the cadres; they still get their grades evaluated and salaries increased, and welfare subsidies... Third, "voluntary labor," with many working as errands for the Hubei Provincial Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. With these three items, what's there to worry about?

If there is nothing else to do, the leadership has its own "magic weapon" - study. Thus, although the cadres are very leisurely in the morning, reading novels and chatting about anecdotes, they are often not slack in the afternoon - reading newspapers aloud to "improve their policy and ideological level."

I have personally seen that from the summer of 1953 to the summer of 1956, the "main task of Wuhan Customs was studying," and from May to October 1956, it was "the only task was studying," or rather, "paralyzed for three years, nominally extinct but actually existing for half a year!" Unfortunately, this kind of strange thing has not disappeared in our country.

    名亡实存的机关
    未鸣
    1956年4月底，武汉长江日报上，出现了这样一则广告，内容不长，抄录如下：“中华人民共和国武汉关公告：我关奉对外贸易部（56）关公林字第445号指示，于本年5月1日撤销，并停止办理所有一切海关业务。特此公告”。
    从那时到现在已经六个月了。可是，这个已经撤销的机关，今天还基本上人马齐全，关长、各处、室主任、股长，直到工友共达四十人。
    这如许“干部”在“干”些什么呢？这是很耐人寻味的。原来，他们还有这几项任务：第一，有“关产”可管，“关产”即武汉市有名的武汉关大厦，也就是交通部门、外贸部门、农产品采购部门的办公大楼。要说海关干部没有事做，至少冤枉了其中一部分人，他们有时甚至要加班（例如国庆节布置）呢！第二，既有人，当然也有“人事”可管，而且不干事不是干部的错，照样得评级提薪，福利补助……。其三，“义务劳动”，为外贸部湖北省特派员办事处当差者甚众。有此三项，何患无事？
    如果再无事可做，领导自有“法宝”——学习。于是，尽管上午干部悠闲得很，看看小说，谈谈掌故，但下午则常常并不松懈——朗读报纸，“提高政策思想水平”。
    我亲眼看见，武汉关从1953年夏到1956年夏是“主要任务在于学习”，1956年5月到10月是“唯一任务在于学习”，或者说，“半身不遂三年，名亡实存半载”！这种怪事不幸在我们国家中仍没有绝迹。
