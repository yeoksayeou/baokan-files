Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: Over forty old Tongmenghui members, as well as elderly people who had worked with or met Mr. Sun Yat-sen, held a symposium in Beijing today to commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday.

In their speeches, the elderly people expressed their deep emotion about the grand commemoration of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday by the people of the whole country this year. Zhou Zhenlin, a delegate to the National People's Congress, said: During the rule of Chiang Kai-shek, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was never commemorated so grandly. Shao Lizi said: This year, many articles commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen have been published in various fields. We should study them well and better inherit Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy.

Chen Qiyuan, in his speech, hoped that old Tongmenghui members in Taiwan and overseas would return to the mainland of the motherland. He said: As a believer in Mr. Sun Yat-sen, one should put the motherland and the people first, and should implement Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will: "Peace, struggle, save China."

The elderly also recalled Mr. Sun Yat-sen's efforts in Japan to oppose the then Qing government, and how he continued to work for the independence and rejuvenation of the motherland after the success of the Xinhai Revolution. They also talked about Mr. Sun Yat-sen's formulation of the Three Great Policies and his earnest teaching of people to take Russia as a teacher.
