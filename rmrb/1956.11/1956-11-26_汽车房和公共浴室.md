　　Car Garage and Public Bathhouse
　　Zhou Jing
　　The Tongchuan Engineering Office has over 500 cadres, but no bathhouse. The cadres hope to build one, but the administrative section replied: "The state has no investment for this." The transportation section's trucks often break down and have to be repaired outdoors. When it's windy and rainy, it affects work. The workers hope to build a simple shed, but the administrative section still replied: "The state has no investment for this."

　　It seems that the state's investment in the Tongchuan Engineering Office is not that generous. If any equipment needs to be added, it needs to be carefully calculated. Efforts should be made to save as much as possible, and things that can be delayed should be delayed, in order to save expenses and accumulate construction funds for the country. In fact, they did not act according to this principle.

　　I don't know where the investment came from, but in October, the administrative section suddenly built a luxurious car garage specifically for parking two small jeeps. The car garage has a construction area of ​​64 square meters, with a total investment of more than 3,300 yuan, an average unit cost of more than 51 yuan. This is 6 yuan higher per square meter than the office building they built last winter. In order to build this car garage, the administrative section first had a technician spend a week designing it: brick and wood structure, stone foundation, concrete lintel, and hollow fire wall, etc. At that time, although the comrades in the budget section raised many opinions, the administrative section turned a deaf ear.

　　Which is more important, the bathhouse problem for more than 500 cadres or the parking problem for two small jeeps? Obviously, the former is more important than the latter. Although the Tongchuan Engineering Office does need a car garage, when building this car garage, it must be considered under the principle of economy, so as to be simple and practical, and should not be extravagant and wasteful. Why do the personnel in the administrative section value two small cars more than the bathhouse for more than 500 people? There are many reasons for this. Perhaps these administrative personnel do not know how to manage finances, or perhaps they are trying to ingratiate themselves with leaders, or perhaps it is for some personal convenience. …In short, no matter how many reasons there are, the most important one is detachment from the masses and a lack of concern for the suffering of the masses.

　　The masses are dissatisfied with such administrative personnel because they are not working for the majority of the masses. In order to effectively solve the difficulties of the masses, it may be worth considering letting out this luxurious car garage to be converted into a bathhouse, and building another shed to store the small jeeps. If this is really done, the masses will be very satisfied.

　　Don't think this is a small matter, because anything that relates to the lives of hundreds of people is no small matter.

    汽车房和公共浴室
  　周静
    铜川工程处有五百多干部，但没有一个浴室，干部们希望修建一个浴室，行政科回答说：“国家没有这笔投资。”运输科的卡车坏了，常常在露天里修理，遇到刮风下雨，就要影响工作，工人们希望搭个简单的棚子，行政科仍旧回答：“国家没有这笔投资。”
    看来，国家投资用在铜川工程处的钱并不是那末宽裕的，如果要添置什么设备，需要精打细算，能节省的尽量节省，能缓办的尽量缓办。节省开支，为国家积累建设资金。事实上，他们并没有按这个原则办事。
    不知道那里来的投资，10月间行政科忽然建设一座豪华的汽车房，这是专门为停放两辆小吉普用的。汽车房的建筑面积六十四平方公尺，总投资三千三百多元，平均单位造价是五十一元多。比去年冬季他们新建的办公室每平方公尺的造价还要高六元。行政科为了要建筑这座汽车房，首先由技术员花了一个星期的时间进行设计：砖木结构，石砌基础，混凝过梁，还有空心火墙等等。当时，虽然预算科的同志提出了不少的意见，行政科却置若罔闻。
    五百多干部的浴室问题同两辆小吉普的停放问题，究竟那个重要呢？显然前者比后者重要，尽管铜川工程处确实需要一个汽车房，但修建这座汽车房的时候，必须考虑在节约的原则下，做到简朴适用，不应该铺张浪费。为什么行政科的人员偏偏把两辆小汽车看得比五百多人的浴室重要呢？分析起来原因很多。可能这些行政人员不会管理财务，也可能他们企图乘此向领导人员讨好，也可能为了个人的某种便利。……总之，不论其中有多少原因，有一条最重要的就是脱离群众，不关心群众疾苦。
    群众对于这样的行政人员是不满意的，因为他不是在为大多数群众办事。为了切实解决群众的困难，不妨可以考虑把这座豪华的汽车房让出来，改建一个浴室，另外搭个棚子存放小吉普车。如果真这样做，群众一定很满意。
    不要认为这是一件小事，因为关系到几百人的生活问题的事情已经不是什么小事了。
