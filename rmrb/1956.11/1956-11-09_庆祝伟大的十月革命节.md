Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 8th: More than 100,000 citizens of Prague held a grand demonstration in Old Town Square on November 7 to celebrate the 39th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

	Czechoslovak Premier Široký told the demonstrators: "The evolution of events in recent weeks has further strengthened our conviction that the basis of the unshakable guarantee of our freedom and independence, the fundamental international guarantee for our successful advance along the socialist road, is our alliance, friendship, and brotherly cooperation with other countries in the camp of peace, first and foremost with the great Soviet Union."

	Široký said that relations with the Soviet Union are deeply rooted in the hearts of the Czechoslovak people. This relationship stems from the historical experience they have exchanged at a high price, from their own experience of the brutality of fascism and the infringement of national rights, and from the fundamental and vital interests of the Czechoslovak people.

	Široký then said that there are few examples in history of such shameless and despicable attacks as the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against the free people of Egypt. Široký, on behalf of the Czechoslovak people, demanded that the aggressors' armed forces immediately withdraw from Egypt.

	Speaking of the great victory of the Hungarian working class over the reactionaries, Široký congratulated the Hungarian people on behalf of the Czechoslovak people and assured them that the Czechoslovak people firmly stand by them in the spirit of solidarity and internationalism.

	Premier Široký's speech was constantly interrupted by cheers and slogans from the crowd. They kept shouting: "Forever stand with the Soviet Union!", "Aggressors get out of Egypt!", "Long live the People's Hungary!"

	Sofia demonstrators shout "Long live Bulgarian-Soviet friendship"

	Bulgarian Communist Party and government leaders Zhivkov, Yugov, Damyanov, and others reviewed the parade from the reviewing stand in "September 9th" Square.

	The mass parade began at 10 a.m. Teams of workers, students, government cadres, scientific workers, literary and art workers, and housewives passed in front of the reviewing stand in "September 9th" Square one after another.

    西罗基说，同苏联的关系，在捷克斯洛伐克人民心中深深扎下了根，这种关系是从他们用高昂的代价折换取来的历史经验中，从他们自己对于法西斯的残暴和国家所遭受的权利侵害的经验中，从捷克斯洛伐克人民的基本切身利益中产生出来的。
    西罗基接着说，像英国、法国和以色列侵略自由的埃及人民这样的无耻而卑鄙的攻击，在历史上只能找出很少几个例子。西罗基代表捷克斯洛伐克人民要求侵略者的武装部队立即撤出埃及。
    在谈到匈牙利工人阶级对反动派的伟大胜利时，西罗基代表捷克斯洛伐克人民向匈牙利人民祝贺，并且向他们提出保证说，捷克斯洛伐克人民本着团结和国际主义的精神坚决地同他们站在一边。
