Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 3rd: Budapest Dispatch: Hungary's revolutionary forces are persisting in the struggle against counter-revolutionary elements in Budapest and throughout Hungary under extremely difficult circumstances.

    On the night of November 2nd, soldiers of the public security forces holding Budapest fought back against the sweeping fire of counter-revolutionary armed forces at an outpost in the city. Inside the city, there was small-scale machine gun and submachine gun fire, interspersed with some mortar fire. It is reported that armed counter-revolutionary elements are rampantly carrying out terrorist activities. Local organizations and members of the Hungarian Working People's Party have become the main targets of counter-revolutionary rioters. The Budapest Municipal Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party has been destroyed. A secretary of the Helvecia organization of the Hungarian Working People's Party in the south was hanged alive, and the organization's building was set on fire by counter-revolutionary elements. The barbaric act of killing public security forces soldiers who have consistently remained loyal to the people's democratic regime during the riots is being intensified. In Budapest, counter-revolutionary elements have organized so-called "revenge squads" to patrol the streets, even the sewers, to search for public security forces soldiers. The bandits shot, hanged, and even poured gasoline on many soldiers and burned them to death. In Miskolc in the east, a mob tied a public security forces soldier to a moving truck and dragged him to death.

    The offices of many social organizations and progressive organizations in Budapest have been looted and burned. Countless Marxist works have been burned in the streets.

    Thugs and thieves released from prisons by counter-revolutionary elements are rampaging. In the past few days, robberies, thefts, and even rapes of women have occurred constantly in Budapest. Counter-revolutionary armed forces are also looting the materials and property of the working people everywhere. In a small place in the Kopuvar area in the west, counter-revolutionary elements forcibly requisitioned thirty quintals of beef and more than ten pigs in one day.

    The counter-revolutionary elements' plot to restore capitalism in Hungary is becoming increasingly apparent. The "Smallholders Party" in Budapest has already put forward a plan to compensate expropriated capitalist factory owners. Many reactionary parties are already talking about so-called "land adjustments," that is, returning the land that was originally distributed to farmers during the people's democratic regime to the landlords. In the Somogy area of Kaposvár in the south, some agricultural producers' cooperatives are being dissolved.

    In some industrial centers, the working masses have gradually realized the true faces of the counter-revolutionary elements who are using the banner of "revolution." Many workers' committees have been organized, and they have stated that they will never allow the expropriated reactionary capitalist factory owners, bank bosses, and landlords to return.

    At present, Hungary has virtually fallen into a state of anarchic chaos. During the riots, "revolutionary committees" of various names were established in Budapest and other parts of the country. Not only were there provincial and municipal "revolutionary committees," but also "revolutionary committees" in many government departments, troops, social organizations, and enterprises. In Budapest, even government departments such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Defense, and the Prosecutor General's Office have established "revolutionary committees." Many of these "revolutionary committees" are controlled by counter-revolutionary elements, who have actually usurped the leadership of government departments, issuing orders and doing whatever they want. The Prosecutor General of the original Prosecutor General's Office was dismissed by the "revolutionary committee" there.

    The Nagy government is actually unable to control the various departments of the government. Nagy himself is also the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but just yesterday (2nd) night, the Foreign Ministry building was attacked by counter-revolutionary armed elements, who drove away the guards there and occupied the building.

    An Agence France-Presse reporter, describing the situation in Budapest, said that "the whole of Budapest presents a pessimistic and tense atmosphere."

    新华社布拉格3日电　布达佩斯消息：匈牙利的革命力量正在十分困难的情况下，在布达佩斯和匈牙利各地坚持对反革命分子的斗争。
    11月2日夜晚，坚守布达佩斯的公安部队战士在城市的一个前哨据点反击反革命武装的扫射。在城内，有小规模的机关枪和冲锋枪的射击，其中还夹杂一些迫击炮声。有消息说，武装反革命分子正在猖狂地进行恐怖活动。各地的劳动人民党党部和党员成了反革命暴徒的主要袭击对象。布达佩斯的劳动人民党市委员会已被捣毁。南部的黑尔维齐亚的劳动人民党组织的一位书记被活活吊死，这个党组织的房子也被反革命分子纵火焚烧。杀害在骚乱过程中一直忠于人民民主政权的公安部队战士的野蛮行为正在加紧进行。在布达佩斯，反革命分子组织所谓“复仇队”在大街上、甚至在下水道里巡逻，搜捕公安部队战士。匪徒们把许多战士枪毙、吊死，甚至还用汽油淋在他们身上烧死，在东部的密斯科尔兹，暴徒把一个公安部队战士拴在一辆开动着的卡车后面活活地拖死。
    布达佩斯的许多社会团体和进步组织的办公地点被劫掠和烧毁。在大街上无数马克思主义的著作被烧毁。
    被反革命分子从狱中释放出来的流氓、盗窃分子正大肆活动。这几天布达佩斯不断发生抢劫、盗窃以至强奸妇女的事件。反革命武装还在到处劫掠劳动人民物资财产。在西部的柯普瓦尔地区的一个小地方，反革命分子在一天内就强征了三十公担的牛肉和十多只猪。
    反革命分子在匈牙利实行资本主义复辟的阴谋，正在越来越明显地暴露出来。在布达佩斯的“小农党”，已经提出对被剥夺了的资本家工厂主进行赔偿的计划。不少反动党派已在谈论所谓“土地调整”，即把原在人民民主政权时期已分配给农民的土地退还给地主。在南部的卡波斯发的绍莫吉地区，一些农业生产合作社正在被解散。
    在一些工业中心，工人群众已逐渐觉察到那些打着“革命”招牌的反革命分子的真面目，许多工人委员会已组织起来，它们表示决不允许被剥夺了的反动的资本家工厂主、银行老板和地主回来。
    目前匈牙利实际上已陷于无政府的混乱状态中。在骚乱期间，在布达佩斯和全国其他地方都成立了各种名目的“革命委员会”。不仅有省的和市的“革命委员会”，而且在许多政府部门、部队、社会团体、企业中都有“革命委员会”。在布达佩斯，甚至连外交部、教育部、国防部、检察总署等政府部门都成立了“革命委员会”。许多这样的“革命委员会”是在反革命分子操纵之下的，他们实际上篡夺了政府部门的领导权，发号施令，为所欲为。原检察总署的检察总长就是被那里的“革命委员会”免职的。
    纳吉政府实际上无法控制政府的各个部门。纳吉本人是兼任外交部长的，但是就在昨天（2日）夜晚，外交部大厦就被反革命武装分子袭击，他们赶走那里的警卫，占领了大厦。
    法新社记者在描述布达佩斯的情势时说，“整个布达佩斯呈现了悲观和紧张的气氛”。
