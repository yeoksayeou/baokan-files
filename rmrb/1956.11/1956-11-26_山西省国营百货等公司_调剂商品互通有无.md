Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Electric Dispatch. The State-Owned Department Store and Textile Company in Shanxi Province recently adopted a method of sending each other "commodity catalogs" to understand their respective inventory and demand, and to conduct planned adjustments. This not only supplied the needs of the peak season market, but also overcame the chaotic phenomenon of blind external procurement in the past.

After the urban and rural markets in Shanxi Province entered the peak season, many grassroots state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives scrambled to send personnel to purchase goods. Major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, as well as neighboring provinces such as Henan, Hebei, and Shaanxi, all had purchasing agents from Shanxi Province. Purchasing agents from various counties and cities in the province also flocked to Taiyuan, competing to purchase goods. Due to the lack of organization and planning in procurement by various units, it not only caused market tension, but also wasted a lot of manpower.

This "commodity catalog" records the commodities that are backlogged or temporarily not needed by the unit, as well as the commodities that are needed by the market but are not available locally, and sends them to fraternal companies for exchange and mutual benefit. Using this method, more than 30 units in the provincial department store and textile company system have adjusted more than 2,000 kinds of commodities between counties and between counties and cities, totaling more than 1.4 million yuan, solving the phenomenon of some commodities being backlogged in one place and out of stock in another. In the past month or so, Taiyuan Department Store Company and Textile Company have used the clues from the "commodity catalogs" of other places to buy back commodities worth more than 460,000 yuan from grassroots stores in more than 20 counties and cities throughout the province. Among them, bicycle lights, watches, milk powder, umbrellas, bed sheets, and sports equipment were all found in the warehouses of grassroots stores.

    山西省国营百货等公司
    调剂商品互通有无
    据新华社太原电　山西省国营百货、针棉织品公司最近采取互送“商品目录”的办法，了解彼此存货和需货情况，并进行有计划的调剂。既供应了旺季市场需要，又克服了过去盲目外出采购的混乱现象。
    山西省城乡市场进入旺季以后，不少基层国营公司和供销合作社争相派员外出采购货物，北京、天津、上海等大城市和邻近的河南、河北、陕西等省都有了山西省的采购员。本省各县、市的采购员也云集太原，争相购货。由于各单位在采购上缺乏组织和计划，不但造成市场紧张，而且浪费了不少人力。
    这种“商品目录”是把本单位压积的或暂时不需要的商品和市场需要而当地又没有货源的商品一一记录下来，印送各兄弟公司，并且依此交换商品，互通有无。利用这个办法，全省百货和针棉织品公司系统就有三十多个单位，在县与县、县与市之间调剂了两千多种商品，总值一百四十多万元，解决了部分商品此处积压彼处脱销的现象。太原市百货公司和针棉织品公司在最近一个多月来，利用外地“商品目录”的线索从全省二十多个县市的基层商店，买回了价值四十六万多元的商品，其中如自行车灯、手表、奶粉、雨伞、床单、运动器具等，都是从基层商店仓库里找到的。
