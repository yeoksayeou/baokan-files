    The Continuous Growth of Minority Workers in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region

    (Our report) Since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the number of minority workers has been continuously growing. According to incomplete statistics, there are already over eight thousand workers, engineers, technicians, and cadres from Mongolian, Hui, Daur, Manchu, Korean, and Uyghur ethnic groups in the region. They are engaged in various technical and management jobs in factories and mines, and some even hold leadership positions. In the Baotou Iron and Steel Company, there are currently twenty-eight minority employees, including eight technicians; one iron ore miner was a Mongolian shepherd in the local pastoral area not long ago. The proportion of minority employees in the Hulunbuir League's forest areas, factories, and mines has also greatly increased. In the Forestry Industry Bureau, there are now Mongolian tractor drivers who operate large tractors in the vast forests to transport timber. The deputy director, workshop director, and product inspection section head of the Hailar Dairy Factory are all Mongolians.

    These minority employees are playing an increasingly important role in the socialist construction of the motherland. Among the forty advanced producers from factories and mines in Hailar City who attended the National and Inner Mongolia Advanced Producers Congresses, thirty-one were from minority ethnic groups. In the Greater Khingan Range forest area, four minority employees also attended the National Advanced Producers Congress. Mongolian tractor driver Wu Liansheng has consistently overfulfilled his timber transportation tasks since 1953, transporting over ten thousand cubic meters of timber for the country and receiving awards twenty-five times in a row. Se Xingga, a Mongolian worker at the Hailar Leather Factory, invented a stretching machine, transforming the factory's leather stretching process from manual to mechanized operation, and was therefore named a labor model six times in a row. Under the education of the Party, the minority employees are also progressing rapidly, and many have joined the Communist Party of China and the Communist Youth League. In the past few years, more than a dozen employees of the Hailar Dairy Factory have joined the Party, accounting for 20% of the factory's Party members.

    Additionally, one hundred and forty young Mongolian men and women have recently joined the work on the Ji(ning)-Er(lian) Railway. After a short training course at the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, this group of young people has been assigned to various business departments such as locomotive, transportation, and telecommunications for internships. During the internship period, Han workers patiently helped them, and contracts for teaching and learning were generally signed between masters and apprentices. Long Tang, a Mongolian worker interning at the Jining Telecommunications Section, has begun to work independently with the help of his Han teacher.

    内蒙古自治区少数民族工人不断成长
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区成立几年来，少数民族工人在不断成长着。据不完全统计，在全区已有蒙古、回、达呼尔、满、朝鲜、维吾尔等族工人、工程技术人员和干部八千余人。他们在厂矿企业内从事各种技术和管理工作，有的还担任领导职务。在包头钢铁公司里，现有二十八名少数民族职工，其中有八名是技术员；有一名铁矿上的矿工在不久以前还是当地牧区的蒙古族牧羊人。呼伦贝尔盟林区和厂矿企业里少数民族职工的比重也有很大增长。森林工业局里出现了蒙古族拖拉机手，他们在大森林里驾驶着大型拖拉机运搬木材。海拉尔牛乳化工厂的副厂长、车间主任、产品检查股等重要的管理职务都由蒙古族的人员担任的。
    这些少数民族职工在祖国社会主义建设中正发挥着日益重要的作用。海拉尔市各厂矿出席全国和内蒙古先进生产者代表大会的四十名先进生产者中，有三十一名是少数民族。大兴安岭林区也有四名少数民族职工出席了全国先进生产者代表大会。蒙古族拖拉机手吴连生，从1953年到现在不断地超额完成运材任务，为国家多运输了上万立方公尺的木材，曾连续二十五次受到奖励。海拉尔皮革厂蒙古族工人色兴嘎创造了一种伸展机，使这个厂伸展皮张的工序由手工变成机器操作，因此曾连续六次被评为劳动模范。少数民族的职工们在党的教育下，进步也很快，许多人都已经参加了中国共产党和青年团。海拉尔牛乳化工厂在几年来已有十数名职工入党，他们占全厂党员人数的20％。

    又讯　最近又有一百四十名蒙古族男、女青年，参加了集（宁）二（连）铁路的工作。这批青年经太原铁路管理局短期训练后，已被分配到机务、车务、电务等各业务部门进行实习。在实习期间，汉族职工耐心地帮助他们，普遍订立了包教、包学的师徒合同。在集宁电务段实习的蒙古族工人龙棠，经过汉族老师帮助已经开始独立进行工作。　　　　　　（旺丹）
