Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 20th: The Dalai Lama departed from Lhasa today, heading to India via Shigatse along with the Panchen Erdeni to attend the 2,500th anniversary commemoration of the Nirvana of Sakyamuni held there. Accompanying the Dalai Lama to India were also his Principal Tutor, the Living Buddha Lingtsang, his Deputy Tutor, the Living Buddha Trijang, and Sokang Wangqing Gelei and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme.

Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet, leading cadres from the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the Tibet Military Region, were present in the western suburbs of Lhasa today to bid farewell to the Dalai Lama. They presented the Dalai Lama with ceremonial silk scarves as a gesture of farewell.

More than 10,000 monks and laypeople of Lhasa gathered in the western suburbs to see off the Dalai Lama, with lama honor guards from major monasteries standing along the roadside. Young Pioneers presented flowers to the Dalai Lama.

The Deputy Consul, Jiacuo Tudeng, of the Indian Consulate General in Lhasa, Tibet, China, as well as Nepalese figures Udai Govi Bishta and Narideva, also went to the suburbs to bid farewell.

Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet and Secretary of the Tibet Working Committe of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a farewell speech, saying, "The Tibetan Buddhist community has made considerable efforts in implementing the Buddha's teachings, loving the motherland, loving peace, and alleviating the suffering of the people; this has led to new developments in the connections between Chinese Tibet and India and Nepal." Zhang Jingwu said, "The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni are not only Buddhist leaders of our Chinese Tibet, but also enjoy high prestige and faith in Asian countries that believe in Buddhism. Their opportunity to meet with Living Buddhas, lay Buddhists, and scholars from all walks of life around the world will make a significant contribution to promoting international unity within the Buddhist community and safeguarding lasting world peace."

The Dalai Lama said in his reply, "As people know, Buddhism is developing normally in Tibet. As the incarnation of Avalokiteśvara who presides over Buddhism, it is a matter of rejoicing for me to participate in this Dharma assembly. I firmly believe that through the conference commemorating the Nirvana of my Buddha, contributions will be made to the immortality of Buddhism, the elimination of war and suffering, and the maintenance of lasting world peace, as advocated by Buddhism."

Before the Dalai Lama left Lhasa, monks and laypeople had continuously visited Norbulingka for seven days to pay homage, and the Dalai Lama also lectured to the monks and laypeople for one day.

    达赖喇嘛动身去印度
    新华社拉萨20日电　达赖喇嘛今天从拉萨出发，取道日喀则和班禅额尔德尼一起前往印度，参加在那里举行的释迦牟尼涅槃二千五百周年纪念大会。随达赖喇嘛同往印度的还有他的正经师林仓活佛、副经师赤江活佛和索康·旺清格来、阿沛·阿旺晋美。
    今天到拉萨西郊去欢送达赖喇嘛的，有中央人民政府驻西藏代表张经武，中共西藏工委、西藏自治区筹备委员会、西藏军区的负责干部。他们向达赖喇嘛送了告别的哈达。
    一万多拉萨僧俗人民在西郊欢送达赖喇嘛，路边站着各大寺院的喇嘛仪仗队。少先队员们向达赖喇嘛献了鲜花。
    印度驻中国西藏拉萨总领事馆的副领事甲错土登和在拉萨的尼泊尔人士宇大公必兴、纳里德巴都也到郊区欢送。
    中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武致欢送词说：“西藏佛教界在执行佛的教旨，热爱祖国，热爱和平，为解脱人民疾苦做了不少努力；使中国西藏和印度、尼泊尔之间的联系得到了新的发展。”张经武说，“达赖、班禅两位大师不仅是我们中国西藏的佛教领袖，而且在亚洲信佛教的国家中享有崇高的声誉和信仰。他们这次能够有机会同世界各界的活佛、居士和学者见面，这对促进佛教界的国际团结，保卫世界持久和平都将取得重大的贡献。”
    达赖喇嘛致答词说：“现在如人们所知，佛教在西藏得到正常的发展。我做为主持佛教的观世音的化身，去参加这次法会，是值得庆喜的事。我坚决相信，通过纪念我佛涅槃的会议，如佛教所主张的对佛教的不灭永存、消除战争和疾苦，以维护世界持久和平等方面有所贡献。”
    达赖喇嘛离开拉萨前，僧俗人民曾连续七天到罗布林卡朝拜，达赖喇嘛还为僧俗人民讲经一天。
