    The Second National Woodcut Exhibition has opened in Beijing. People have deep feelings for woodcuts, and they say this is a festival for woodcut artists.
    In these days, many comrades have written articles, introducing this exhibition from various aspects. Friends who have visited the exhibition have said that this time the works are very lively and rich, with many valuable works by new comrades. They come from very far away, from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to Yunnan and Sichuan in the southwest, from Guangdong in the south to Heilongjiang in the northeast…, reflecting a wide range of life, reflecting our socialist construction life from all aspects.
    People are talking about this exhibition, studying the gains and losses of certain works, offering very insightful opinions, and raising the requirements for woodcut artists, asking them to serve more for literary illustrations and for children of all ages, expanding the scope of service. These opinions are put forward in line with the development speed of socialist construction, and they are very correct from any point of view.
    Thanks to the care of the Party and the people, and the creative efforts of comrades in the woodcut circle, the art of woodcut will undoubtedly usher in a greater situation. However, problems are not absent.
    To this day, we do not have boards for carving woodcuts, comrades who are learning woodcuts cannot buy knives, and students in the printmaking department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts and international students from brother countries cannot buy boards, knives, and other related tools and materials. This is very inconsistent with the scale of our woodcut art development.
    Speaking of this, well-intentioned comrades will surely think of the "Fine Arts Service Department" on Wangfujing in Beijing. That's right, the Fine Arts Service Department has sold these things.
    The festival is supposed to be a happy occasion, but mentioning the Fine Arts Service Department makes one feel very regretful. The Fine Arts Service Department only sells things that international friends like, but rarely sells the tools and materials that artists often need, or has never sold them. There is no need to give more examples. As long as you are willing, anyone can go to the Fine Arts Service Department to see this fact at any time.
    I also want to talk about another related matter.
    In 1953, from a comrade in a seal-carving shop, I learned that there was a workshop in Beijing specializing in making materials for carving seals, which might be able to make some boards for woodcuts for us. However, later, because I couldn't find that comrade from the seal-carving shop, a very valuable clue was broken.
    A year later, by chance, from Comrade Zhang Shunxing, who makes woodcut knives, I got the address of the seal material workshop that we had been looking for for a long time. That afternoon, we found this workshop. We spent nearly three months studying the production and improvement of woodcut boards. Thanks to their enthusiastic research, this small workshop produced a batch of woodcuts that Comrade Li Hua said were "the best wood boards in the history of new woodcuts." International students from our brother countries also believe that this batch of wood boards, including "wood surface" and "wood end," has international standards.
    We were very excited and immediately contacted the printmaking group of the Chinese Artists Association and the Fine Arts Service Department, hoping to help and consolidate this workshop and make it a national supply base for printmaking materials. After nearly half a year of research, consideration, and instructions, the two or three comrades in this small workshop were finally able to join the Fine Arts Service Department.
    Just at this time, coincidentally, the Fine Arts Service Department was changed to be directly under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives. This "new" Fine Arts Service Department was not prepared to absorb this workshop that supplied woodcut boards.
    That's how it is, it's over! This small workshop joined a seal-carving cooperative and can no longer make boards for us because they have already been "cooperativized."
    At this time, some comrades came up with an idea: "Let's find a People's Representative!" Yes! Find oil painter Wu Zuoren, he is a People's Representative. But later I learned that Comrade Wu Zuoren was also angry because the Fine Arts Service Department had also removed a technician who was making oil painting tool materials. The nature of this problem is the same as our problem, and it is very headache-inducing. Then, find cartoonist Hua Junwu, he is also a People's Representative. At this time, it's really a coincidence! The Fine Arts Service Department sent comrades to find us.
    The things we talked about were all happy things: the few comrades in the workshop that specializes in making woodcut boards will soon be able to join the Fine Arts Service Department, and instructions have been sought, and so on. Other woodcut tools and materials will also be produced immediately, but—I need to design the whole thing, because I am engaged in woodcuts.
    Because I am indeed engaged in woodcuts, I had to seriously do this. I spent three nights of work time drawing a stack of design drawings, and I also contacted the relevant comrades of the Fine Arts Service Department on this issue five or six times. In order to solve these designs, I also ran to the hardware company several times, and also did some specific experiments. They said they couldn't find carpenters, and then tried to introduce carpenters to them...
    But how strange, everything seems to have never happened. Half a year has passed, and when I asked the relevant comrades of the Fine Arts Service Department, it was like a lifetime ago. "Ah? Ah?" No one knows where to start. What about the matter? There is no result at all. What exactly is going on?
    I hope that the Fine Arts Service Department can quickly answer our requirements for woodcut art, especially woodcut tools and materials. As far as I know, there are one or two thousand letters from all over the country to the Fine Arts Service Department ordering woodcut boards. On the one hand, there is an objective and urgent need, and on the other hand, there is indifference to the urgent need, as well as erroneous business ideas.
    I hope this short article can produce the desired effect. Improving the supply of woodcut tools and materials is the most practical congratulations to the Second National Woodcut Exhibition.

    版画的节日
    黄永玉
    第二届全国版画展览会在北京开幕了。人们对版画有很深的感情，说这是版画家的节日。
    在这些日子里，很多同志都写了文章，从各方面来介绍了这个展览会。参观过展览会的朋友们，都说这一次的作品很热闹、很丰富，有很多新同志的可贵的作品，来的地方都很远，从内蒙古自治区到西南的云南、四川，从南方的广东到东北的黑龙江………，表现的生活面也很广，从各方面反映出我们社会主义建设的生活。
    人们都在谈论这个展览会，研究某幅作品的得失，意见提得很在行，对版画家的要求提高了，要版画家多为文学插图服务，多为各种年龄的儿童服务，扩大服务的范围。这些意见是配合着社会主义建设的发展速度而提出来的，无论从哪个角度来看，都是很正确的。
    版画艺术由于党和人民的关怀，和版画界同志们创造性的努力，无疑地将会出现一个更大的局面。但是，问题却并不是没有。
    到今天，我们没有刻木刻用的板子，学习木刻的同志买不到刀子，中央美术学院版画系的同学和兄弟国家的留学生买不到板子、刀子和其他有关的工具材料，这是和我们版画艺术发展的规模很不相称的。
    说到此，好心的同志们定会想起北京王府井的“美术服务部”。不错，美术服务部是发售过这些东西。
    过节日本来是应该高兴的，但是一说起美术服务部，就觉得十分遗憾。美术服务部尽卖国际友人喜好的东西，美术家经常需用的工具材料却很少卖，或是从来没有卖过。例子是用不着多举的，只要愿意，谁都可以到美术服务部去看看，就随时可以看到这种事实。
    我还要说说另一件有关的事。
    1953年，从一位刻字铺的同志那里，知道北京有一间专门制作刻字印章材料的作坊，可能为我们做一些木刻用的板子。可是，后来因为找不到刻字铺那位同志了，一个非常珍贵的线索就断了。
    一年后，一个偶然的机会，从打木刻刀的张顺兴同志那儿，得到我们久要寻找的那间印章材料作坊的地址，当天下午，我们就找到了这间作坊。我们用了将近三个多月的时间，来研究木刻板的制作和改进。由于他们的热心钻研，这间小小的作坊，制出了一批正如李桦同志说的“新木刻有史以来最好的木板”，我们兄弟国家的留学生也认为这批包括“木面”“木口”的木板，具有国际水平。
    我们非常兴奋，马上通过中国美术家协会的版画组，和美术服务部联系，希望能帮助和巩固这家作坊，使其成为全国性的版画材料的供应据点。经过将近大半年的研究、考虑、请示，这一间小作坊的两三位同志，总算可以参加到美术服务部去工作了。
    就在这时，事有凑巧，美术服务部改为直接属于全国合作总社领导了。这个“新”的美术服务部不准备吸收这个供应木刻板的作坊。
    事情就是这样，完了！这间小作坊参加了一个刻字合作社，不能再为我们做板子，因为他们已经“合作化”。
    这时候，有的同志想主意了：“我们找人民代表去！”对！找油画家吴作人同志，他是人民代表。但事后知道，吴作人同志也在生气，因为美术服务部把一位正在做油画工具材料的技术人员也弄出去了。这个问题的性质和我们的问题一样，都很使人头痛。那么，找漫画家华君武同志去，他也是人民代表。这时，真巧！美术服务部派同志找我们来了。
    谈的话都是使人高兴的事：专做木刻板那作坊的几位同志很快就可以参加美术服务部，已经请示去了，等等。其他木刻工具材料也马上进行制作，不过，——要请我整个地设计一下，因我是搞木刻的。
    因为我果然是搞木刻的，只好认真地做这件事情。我用了三个夜晚的工作时间画了一叠设计图，还同美术服务部的有关同志就这问题接触过五、六次，为解决这些设计，还跑了几次五金公司，又作了一些具体的实验，他们说找不到木工，又设法去为他们介绍木工……
    可是多么奇怪，一切事情都好像没有发生过似的。半年过去了，问起美术服务部有关的同志，简直恍如隔世，“啊？啊？”谁也不知该从哪里说起。事情呢？一点结果也没有。这到底是怎么一回事呢？
    我希望美术服务部能很快的答复我们对于版画方面尤其是木刻工具材料方面的要求。据我所知，全国各地写信向美术服务部定购木刻板的，就有一两千块之多，一方面是客观的迫切的要求，另一方面则是对于迫切要求的漠视，还有错误的经营思想。
    希望这篇短文能够产生应有的效果。版画工具材料供应工作的改进，是对第二届全国版画展览会的最实际的祝贺。
