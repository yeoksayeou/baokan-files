    Changing the Phenomenon of Overlapping Institutions and Redundant Staff
    Zhejiang Province Holds Meeting to Study Work on Tightening Staffing Levels
    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 23rd dispatch) From November 15th to 19th, the Zhejiang Provincial Staffing Committee convened a meeting of directors of staffing committees from various special districts, directly administered cities, and counties, as well as leading staff from provincial-level organs. The meeting discussed the transitional plan for the administrative organization staffing below the special district level and the work of streamlining state organs.
    During the meeting, attendees revealed many serious instances of overlapping institutions and redundant staff. They believed that this not only wasted a large amount of the state's manpower, materials, and financial resources, but more seriously, it fostered the development of bureaucracy and paperwork within state organs. The meeting discussed the opinions on the draft of the partial adjustment of the administrative organization staffing below the special district level proposed by the Zhejiang Provincial Staffing Committee and unanimously expressed agreement with the principle of appropriate streamlining and partial adjustment proposed by the Provincial Staffing Committee, and the principle of appropriately tightening the staffing of special district-level organs and province-administered cities, while strengthening county and township leadership.
    At the meeting, Zhejiang Province Vice Governor Yang Siyi spoke on the consolidation work. He said that the consolidation work in Zhejiang Province in the past few years has not been thorough enough. At present, subjectivism and bureaucracy are still very serious in state organs at all levels, including business and enterprise organs, and phenomena such as large organizations, numerous levels, unclear responsibilities, low efficiency, and redundant staff are still very common. Yang Siyi emphasized that correct handling of institutional and staffing adjustments must be closely combined with improving leadership, improving work, improving work efficiency, and overcoming subjectivism and bureaucracy. He also asked leading staff of state organs to make ideological and organizational preparations for further streamlining institutions, tightening staffing levels, and launching a conservation campaign in organs next year.
    The meeting determined the tasks of the staffing committees at all levels: to summarize the experience of past consolidation work, grasp the guiding principles and policies of staffing work, study and determine the transitional plan for institutional staffing, master staffing discipline, and carry out investigation and research work.

    改变机构重叠人浮于事的现象
    浙江省开会研究紧缩编制的工作
    本报杭州23日电　11月15日至19日，浙江省编制委员会召开了各专区、直属市、县编制委员会主任和省级机关的领导工作人员会议。会议讨论了专区以下行政机构编制的过渡方案和精简国家机构的工作。
    会议期间，到会人员揭发了不少机构重叠和人浮于事的严重现象。他们认为：这不仅浪费了国家大量的人力、物力和财力，更严重的是助长了国家机关工作中的官僚主义、文牍主义的发展。会上讨论了浙江省编制委员会提出的专区以下行政机构编制局部调整草案的意见，一致表示同意省编制委员会提出的适当精简、局部调整的方针，和适当紧缩专区一级机关、省辖市编制，加强县乡领导的原则。
    会上，浙江省副省长杨思一就整编工作讲了话。他说，浙江省过去几年的整编工作不够彻底，现在全省各级机关，包括事业、企业机关中的主观主义和官僚主义仍很严重，机构庞大、层次繁多、职责不清、效率不高、人浮于事等现象还很普遍。杨思一着重指出：正确处理机构编制调整，必须同改进领导、改进工作、提高工作效率、克服主观主义和官僚主义密切结合起来。他并且要求国家机关领导工作人员为明年进一步精简机构、紧缩编制和在机关中开展节约运动，作好思想准备和组织准备。
    会议确定了各级编制委员会的任务：总结过去历次整编工作的经验，掌握编制工作的方针政策，研究确定机构编制的过渡方案，掌握编制纪律，开展调查研究工作。
