Strengthen Leadership in Current Rural Financial Work

Our Commentator

The State Council has issued instructions on several issues in rural financial work (see page 1 of this newspaper, October 30), requiring all localities to seize the current opportunity of large-scale procurement of agricultural products to recover overdue agricultural loans, absorb rural deposits, and clear prepaid deposits. These tasks are of great significance for preparing agricultural production funds for next year.

This spring, many agricultural production cooperatives raised most of the required working capital and capital construction funds by means of pooling share funds; the state also provided a large number of agricultural loans and a portion of prepaid deposits for agricultural products, supplementing the insufficient portions. These funds played an important role in the smooth realization of the 1956 agricultural production plan and in appropriately meeting the living needs of agricultural cooperative members before the harvest of agricultural products. In the first half of this year, some agricultural cooperatives encountered some difficulties in production and livelihood because sideline production was not well organized and the sideline income of cooperative members decreased. The state then issued a large number of production loans and living loans to help them overcome the difficulties at that time, and also played a great role in the restoration and development of rural sideline production.

Now, most of these loans and some previous old loans have matured. Once the loans have matured, they should be repaid as much as possible. Repaying overdue loans is beneficial to the operation of agricultural cooperatives and also beneficial to the country. For agricultural cooperatives, it can reduce the interest burden, and it can also avoid excessive spending this year and insufficient funds next year; at the same time, repaying old loans also increases the country's lending power for next year, and it can be borrowed again when it needs to be used next year. For the country, it can support this year's procurement, reduce currency issuance, consolidate the stability of the market; at the same time, it can prepare loan funds for next year.

Agricultural income is seasonal. In the early stages of agricultural cooperativization, some cooperative members will always have difficulties during the period between harvests. In order to enable credit cooperatives and banks to maintain greater strength to help these cooperative members overcome the difficulties during the period between harvests, overdue loans should be recovered as much as possible during the season of higher income.

Except for a few areas that have suffered severe natural disasters, the harvest in most areas this year is good, the production of the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives has increased, and the income of the vast majority of cooperative members has increased. Now, the autumn harvest has basically ended, and agricultural cooperatives in various places are carrying out or preparing to distribute income. Next year's production costs and capital construction funds, public welfare funds, etc., must be retained from this year's income. Of these funds retained by agricultural cooperatives, in addition to seeds, feed, forage, and some fertilizers, etc., in kind, a small portion is used for current sideline production and preparations for winter production this year, and another large portion is retained for production next year. This part of the funds retained for use next year becomes a reliable source for repaying overdue loans and increasing rural deposits.

According to the preliminary trial calculation materials of 84 agricultural cooperatives surveyed on the spot in fifteen provinces including Jiangxi, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hebei, Guangdong, Shandong, Jilin, Liaoning, Shanxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan, as long as a positive attitude is adopted towards loan recovery and deposits in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's instructions—government and bank cadres should actively recover loans, agricultural cooperatives and farmers should actively repay loans—most of this year's overdue agricultural loans can be recovered. The survey materials of 84 agricultural cooperatives prove that in agricultural cooperatives where the total income of agriculture and sideline occupations has increased greatly, most of the cooperatives have the strength to fully repay the production cost loans due this year. For example, in the seven non-disaster-stricken cooperatives in five counties surveyed in Henan, a total of 100,533 yuan was withheld for public accumulation funds and production costs in autumn, and 19,552 yuan was owed in overdue loans, of which 17,725 yuan could be repaid, accounting for 90.6% of the overdue loans. In the eight cooperatives surveyed in Hunan, seven cooperatives increased production and only one cooperative decreased production. The eight cooperatives retained a total of 64,164 yuan for production costs, and owed a total of 12,973 yuan in production cost loans. After repaying prepaid purchases, sales on credit, cooperative member investments, and agricultural and sideline production costs that still need to be spent this year, and the physical objects that must be stored (seeds, feed, etc.), 10,459 yuan can be repaid, accounting for 80.6% of the original loan amount. In this type of cooperative, more than 80%-90% of the households have increased their income, and they have the ability to repay all or most of the overdue loans. In this type of cooperative, as long as the work is done well, there is no problem in recovering more than 70%-80% of the overdue loans. In agricultural cooperatives where the total income of agriculture and sideline occupations has increased slightly or decreased slightly, it is difficult to repay all the overdue loans due to the smaller amount of public accumulation funds and production costs retained; however, a large portion of the overdue loans can still be repaid. The number of households in this type of cooperative that have increased their income is still above 80%, and they still have the ability to repay a portion of the loan. In agricultural cooperatives that have suffered severe natural disasters and the total income of agriculture and sideline occupations has decreased greatly, the agricultural cooperative itself has no ability to repay the loan, and most of the cooperative members also have no ability to repay the loan. However, in such cooperatives, the income of each household also varies greatly, and the income of some cooperative members has still increased or remained unchanged. It is still possible to recover overdue loans from this portion of households.

The increase or decrease in farmers' income is a major standard for measuring repayment ability, but it is not the only standard. Specific analysis should be made for certain special circumstances. For example, in actual work, the following situation may be encountered: although some cooperative members have increased their income, their repayment ability is very small because their family assets are too weak and the necessary minimum expenditures in life this year are large (such as no quilts, cotton clothes, etc.). Although the income of some cooperative members has decreased slightly compared with last year, their repayment ability is relatively large because their family assets are not weak and they do not need to add many necessary living supplies.

When carrying out loan recovery, the income and expenditure of agricultural cooperatives and farmers who owe overdue loans should be specifically analyzed. The amount of overdue loans they repay should be determined based on the actual situation of each agricultural cooperative and farmer. For the overdue loans of agricultural cooperatives, the funds used this winter should be retained from the cash portion of the public accumulation fund and next year's production expenses they retain, and the remaining portion can be repaid. If there are still surplus funds after repayment, they can be mobilized to deposit them in credit cooperatives or banks on a voluntary basis, and the credit cooperatives or banks will pay interest according to regulations. For the overdue loans of farmers, except for households that have suffered severe disasters and individual households that have special difficulties, which can be recovered less or temporarily not recovered, the general principle of borrowing and repaying on time should be adhered to.

At present, some places have seized the favorable opportunity of preliminary trial calculation or preliminary distribution of agricultural cooperatives, and have conducted specific research on the income and expenditure of agricultural cooperatives and cooperative members, and the agricultural cooperatives and cooperative members themselves have formulated repayment plans; during the distribution, the cooperative members repay the loans according to the plan with the cash they receive (some can change the original plan if they have special circumstances and raise legitimate reasons). In this way, the agricultural cooperatives and cooperative members are very satisfied, and the results of loan recovery and deposit are also very good.

In many places, the work has not been carried out so meticulously. Some financial staff members have no idea, shout difficulties in vain, do not specifically analyze repayment ability, and do not deeply publicize loan recovery and deposit policies. In such places, the progress of loan recovery is very slow and the results of deposit are very small.

Recovering overdue agricultural loans, absorbing rural deposits, and clearing prepaid deposits are major events related to the peak season market and agricultural production funds for next year. The quality of these tasks directly affects the relationship between the Party and the government and the broad masses of peasants. To do these tasks well, it is necessary to conduct specific analysis and grasp specifically according to the policies stipulated by the Party and the government and the actual situation of agricultural production cooperatives and cooperative members. Therefore, it is not enough to entrust this task only to bank and credit cooperative cadres. Party organizations and people's committees at all levels, especially the Party organizations and people's committees at the county, district, and township levels, must pay special attention to strengthening leadership over the work of banks and credit cooperatives during this period. When arranging unified purchase work and market work, these tasks should be arranged in a unified manner; when leading agricultural cooperatives to carry out income distribution work, propaganda work should be carried out at the same time to recover overdue agricultural loans, absorb deposits, and clear prepaid deposits, calling on agricultural cooperatives and cooperative members to formulate repayment plans according to their own repayment ability, and calling on cooperative members to voluntarily and actively deposit idle money into credit cooperatives. Credit cooperatives should try every means to ensure convenient withdrawals and do a good job in serving farmers. For those who owe prepaid deposits, they should actively clear them when selling grain and cotton.

    加强对当前农村金融工作的领导
    本报评论员
    国务院发布了关于农村金融工作中若干问题的指示（见本报10月30日第一版），要求各地抓紧目前正在大量收购农产品的时机，收回到期农贷，吸收农村存款，清理预购定金。这些工作，对于准备明年的农业生产资金有十分重要的意义。
    今年春天，许多农业生产合作社用平摊股份基金的办法筹集了所需要的大部分流动资金和基本建设资金；国家也提供了大量农业贷款和一部分农产品的预购定金，补充了不足的部分。这些资金对顺利实现1956年的农业生产计划和在农产品收获以前适当满足农业社员的生活需要，起了重要的作用。今年上半年，有些农业社由于副业生产组织得不好，社员的副业收入减少了，一部分社员在生产和生活方面发生了一些困难。国家又发放了大量的生产贷款和生活贷款，帮助他们克服了当时的困难，对农村副业的恢复和发展也起了很大作用。
    现在，这些贷款和以前的一些旧贷款，大部分都已经到期。贷款既已到期，就应该尽力归还。归还到期贷款，对农业社的经营是有利的，对国家也是有利的。对农业社来说，可以减少利息负担，也可以避免今年支用过多，明年资金不够；同时，归还了旧贷，也增加了明年国家的贷款力量，明年需要使用的时候，可以再借。对国家来说，可以支持今年的收购，减少货币投放量，巩固市场的稳定状态；同时，可以为明年准备下贷款资金。
    农业的收入是有季节性的，在农业合作化刚刚实现的时期，一部分社员在青黄不接的时候，总还是会有困难的。为了使信用社和银行保持较大的力量帮助这些社员克服青黄不接时期的困难，应该在收入较多的季节，尽力收回已经到期的贷款。
    除了遭受严重自然灾害的少数地区以外，今年大部分地区的收成是好的，绝大部分农业社的生产提高了，绝大部分社员的收入增加了。现在，秋收已经大体结束，各地农业社正在进行收益分配或准备分配。下一年度的生产费用和基本建设资金、公益金等，都要在今年的收入中留下来。农业社留下的这些资金，除了种子、饲料、饲草和一部分肥料等等实物以外，有一小部是用于目前的副业和准备今年冬季生产使用的，另外一大部则是留作明年生产使用的。留作明年使用的这部分资金，就成为归还到期贷款、增加农村存款的可靠来源。
    根据最近江西、湖南、江苏、浙江、河南、湖北、安徽、河北、广东、山东、吉林、辽宁、山西、贵州、云南等十五个省实地调查的八十四个农业社预分试算的材料看来，只要按照国务院指示的精神，对收贷、存款采取积极的态度——政府和银行干部要积极收贷，农业社和农民要积极还贷，今年的到期农贷大部分是可以收回的。八十四个农业社的调查材料证明：在农副业总收入增加很多的农业社里，对今年到期的生产费用贷款，绝大部分社是有力量全部归还的。如河南调查的五个县七个非灾区社，秋季共扣留公积金生产费用十万零五百三十三元，欠到期贷款一万九千五百五十二元，能还一万七千七百二十五元，占到期贷款的90.6％。湖南调查的八个社，七个社是增产的，只有一个社减产，八个社共留生产费用六万四千一百六十四元，欠生产费用贷款共一万二千九百七十三元，除偿还预购、赊销，社员投资及今年尚需开支的农副业生产费用和必须储存的实物（种子、饲料等）外，能偿还贷款一万零四百五十九元，占原贷款总数的80.6％。这类社里的社员80％—90％以上的户是增加了收入的，他们都有偿还到期贷款全部、大部分的能力。在这类社里，只要做好工作，收回到期贷款的70％—80％以上是没有问题的。在农副业总收入稍有增加或稍有减少的农业社里，由于留公积金和生产费用较少，偿还全部到期贷款就有困难；但是也能归还到期贷款的一大部分。这类社的社员增加收入的户仍然在80％以上，归还一部分贷款的能力仍然是有的。在遭受严重自然灾害，农副业总收入减少很多的农业社里，农业社本身就没有偿还贷款的能力，社员中也是绝大部分没有偿还贷款能力的。但是，在这样的社里，各个农户的收入也是相差很大的，有一部分社员的收入仍然是增加了或者不增不减的，对这一部分户收回到期贷款仍然是可能的。
    农民收入的增减，是衡量偿还能力的一个主要标准，但不是唯一的标准。对于某些特殊情况，应该做具体的分析。例如在实际工作中会遇到这样的情况：有的社员虽然收入增加了，但由于家底太薄，今年生活上必需的起码的支出较多（如没有被子、棉衣等等），偿还能力也很小。有的社员虽然收入比去年稍有减少，却因为家底不薄，需要添置的必需的生活用品不多，偿还能力就比较大。
    在进行收贷的时候，对欠有到期贷款的农业社和农民的收支情况，要进行具体的分析。要从每一个农业社和农民的实际情况出发，确定他们归还到期贷款的数额。对农业社的到期贷款，要在他们留的公积金和下年度生产费用的现金部分中留下今年冬季使用的资金，其余部分可以归还。归还后仍有余资，可以动员他们在自愿原则下存入信用社或银行，由信用社或银行按照规定付给利息。对农民的到期贷款，除受灾严重的户和虽未受灾但有特殊困难的个别户可以少收回或者暂不收回以外，一般的都应该坚持有借有还的原则，按期归还。
    目前，有些地方已经抓紧农业社预分试算或进行预分的有利时机，对农业社和社员的收支情况进行了具体的研究，由农业社和社员自己订出还款计划；在分配的时候，社员就把分到手里的现金按计划归还贷款（有的如果因特殊情况确实按原计划归还，提出正当的理由还可以改变）。这样做，农业社和社员都很满意，收贷和存款的成绩也都很好。
    有很多地方，还没有这样细致地进行工作。有的金融工作人员心中无数，空喊困难，不具体分析偿还能力，不深入宣传收贷和存款政策。这样的地方，收贷的进度很慢，存款的成绩也很小。
    收回到期农贷，吸收农村存款，清理预购定金，是有关旺季市场、有关明年农业生产资金的大事。这些工作做得好坏，直接涉及党和政府同广大农民群众的关系。要作好这些工作，又必须根据党和政府规定的政策和农业生产合作社及社员的实际情况进行具体分析，加以具体的掌握。因此，把这项工作仅仅交给银行和信用社干部去办是不够的。各级党组织和人民委员会，尤其是县、区、乡的党组织和人民委员会，在这一段时间里，必须特别注意加强对于银行和信用社工作的领导。在安排统购工作和市场工作的时候，要把这些工作作统一的安排；在领导农业社进行收益分配工作的时候，要同时进行收回到期农贷、吸收存款、清理预购定金的宣传工作，号召农业社和社员按照自己的偿还能力订出还款计划，号召社员自愿地积极地把闲钱存入信用社。信用社要想尽一切办法，保证做到取款方便，作好对农民的服务工作。对欠有预购定金的，要在出售粮棉的时候积极清理。
