Xinhua News Agency, 20th. According to TASS, Tel Aviv, 19th: The General Secretary of the Israeli Communist Party, Mikunis, wrote in "People's Voice": "No enemy could cause such great damage to the national interests of Israel as the Israeli rulers. The shameful collusion of the Israeli militarist group with the imperialist running dogs pursues two goals: to create a pretext for British and French military intervention in Egypt; to invade and annex the territory of other countries."

Mikunis wrote that the political direction of the Israeli Communist Party is to fight against the war of aggression and to strive for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Egypt.

    以共总书记表明党的政治方针
    争取把以军立即撤离埃及
    据新华社20日讯　据塔斯社特拉维夫19日讯：以色列共产党总书记米库尼斯在“人民呼声报”上写道：“任何一个敌人都不会像以色列执政者那样，使以色列的民族利益遭到这样大的损害。以色列军国主义集团同帝国主义鹰犬所进行的可耻勾结，追求的是两个目的：为英国和法国军事干涉埃及制造借口；侵略别国的领土和吞并这些领土。”
    米库尼斯写道，以色列共产党的政治方针是，为反对侵略战争和争取立即把军队撤离埃及而斗争。
