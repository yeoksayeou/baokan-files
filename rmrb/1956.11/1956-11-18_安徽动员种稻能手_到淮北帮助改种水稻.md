    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 15th. A large number of farmers with rice-planting experience from the well-known rice-producing regions along the Yangtze River, such as Wuhu and Anqing, have recently gone to the Huaibei Plain to help Huaibei farmers change to rice cultivation. As of the 12th, more than 2,270 of these rice-planting experts have arrived in the Huaibei area. According to the planned schedule, the total number of rice-planting experts mobilized to the Huaibei area this year will be 11,000.
    It is the first time in Anhui Province to mobilize such a large technical force within the province for agricultural production reform. Because most farmers in the Huaibei area have not grown rice, they need technical assistance. Rice-planting experts along the Yangtze River will serve as technical instructors for rice planting in Huaibei. They will participate in the entire rice-growing process, from building embankments, storing water, raising seedlings, field management to harvesting. Their work period is about one year. During the work period, the government will provide appropriate care for their lives and medical treatment.
    After all these rice-planting experts arrive in the Huaibei area, the Fuyang and Bengbu special districts will also send the same number of agricultural cooperative members to the agricultural cooperatives along the river to participate in production and learn rice-planting techniques.

    安徽动员种稻能手
    到淮北帮助改种水稻
    新华社合肥15日电　长江沿岸著名产稻区芜湖、安庆等专区的大批有种稻经验的农民，最近前往淮北平原帮助淮北农民改种水稻。到12日止，到达淮北地区的这些种稻能手已经有二千二百七十多人。按照预定计划，今年动员到淮北地区去的种稻能手总数将有一万一千人。
    在省区内调动如此众多的技术力量进行农业上的生产改革，这在安徽省还是第一次。由于淮北地区的大多数农民没有种过水稻，他们需要技术帮助。长江沿岸的种稻能手们，将在淮北充当种稻的技术指导。他们将参加从打圩、蓄水、育秧、田间管理到收割的整个种稻过程。他们的工作期大约一年。在工作期间，政府对他们的生活、医药等方面将给以适当的照顾。
    在这些种稻能手们全部到达淮北地区以后，阜阳、蚌埠两专区也将派出同样多的农业社社员，前往沿江的农业社参加生产，学习种稻技术。
