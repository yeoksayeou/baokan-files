Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 29th: Mr. Murata Shozo, President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and President of the Japan Commodity Exhibition, and Mr. Yadoya Eiichi, head of the Japan Commodity Exhibition Delegation, hosted a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at the Friendship Cinema in the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building at noon today, introducing them to the Japan Commodity Exhibition which will open in Shanghai on December 1st.

At the reception, Mr. Murata Shozo repeatedly stated that holding a Japanese commodity exhibition in China is not just about doing business, but also about hoping to contribute to China's construction, strengthen the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, and promote the early realization of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries.

In response to a reporter's question, Murata Shozo said, "The embargo policy is unreasonable. Most of Japanese public opinion tends to abolish the embargo. Japanese business circles have been working hard to promote the abolition of the embargo for the past two years, and have directly made this request to the President of the United States, a major country participating in the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM)." He said, "Our negotiations only became effective after we learned that countries such as Britain were exporting embargoed goods to China."

He believes that the day for expanding trade between China and Japan will surely arrive.

Mr. Yadoya Eiichi, head of the Japan Commodity Exhibition Delegation, expressed regret that the Japanese commodity exhibition held in China could not fully display various Japanese-made light and heavy industrial equipment. However, he said that the goods exhibited in Shanghai have increased compared to those exhibited in Beijing.

Yadoya Eiichi told reporters that we received news on our way to China that Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi had announced that the Japanese government would approve the sale of embargoed goods exhibited in China. Therefore, all the goods exhibited here that China needs can be left behind.

Before the reception, Chinese and foreign reporters visited the venue of the Japan Commodity Exhibition in the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building.

    扩大中日贸易的日子定会到来
    日本商品展览会明天将在上海开幕
    展出的禁运商品日本政府将批准出售
    据新华社上海29日电　日本国际贸易促进协会会长、日本商品展览会总裁村田省藏和日本商品展览团团长宿谷荣一，今天中午在上海中苏友好大厦的友谊电影院里招待中外记者，向记者们介绍了将于12月1日在上海开幕的日本商品展览会的情况。
    村田省藏先生在招待会上一再表示，在中国举办日本商品展览会不仅是做买卖，而是希望对于中国的建设有所帮助，加强中日两国人民的友谊，以促使两国间的正常邦交早日实现。
    村田省藏在回答记者的问题时说：“禁运政策是不合理的。日本舆论界大多倾向于撤消禁运。日本工商界两年来一直为促使撤消禁运而努力，并且直接向参加巴黎统筹委员会的主要国家美国的总统提出过这个要求。”他说：“直到我们知道英国等国家向中国输出了禁运的商品以后，我们的交涉才有了效力。”
    他认为中日两国间扩大贸易来往的日子一定会到来。
    日本商品展览团团长宿谷荣一对于在中国举行的日本商品展览会上不能充分展出日本出产的各种轻重工业设备表示遗憾。但他说，在上海展出的商品已经比在北京展出的有了增加。
    宿谷荣一告诉记者们说，我们在来中国途中得到消息，日本通商产业相石桥湛山已经宣布日本政府将批准出售在中国展览的禁运商品。因此，在这里展出的商品凡是中国需要的都可以留下来。
    在招待会举行前，中外记者参观了在上海中苏友好大厦的日本商品展览会会场。
