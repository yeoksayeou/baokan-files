Xinhua News Agency, Qingjiang, 28th – The Chinese Communist Party’s Huaiyin Local Committee in Jiangsu Province, through investigation and research, and by summarizing the year's agricultural production work, has initially identified the reasons for the unstable agricultural production locally and some relatively practical measures for leading local farmers to change their impoverished situation.

The Huaiyin Special District is located downstream of the Huai, Yi, Shu, and Si rivers, and has historically been prone to disasters. Since 1949, the state has invested in harnessing the Shu, diverting the Yi, and managing the Huai, basically eliminating the threat of ordinary floods. However, waterlogging still occurs almost every year. Out of the special district’s 19,640,000 mu of cultivated land, over 12 million mu were affected by waterlogging this year. To fundamentally reverse this situation, the CCP Huaiyin Local Committee and the Party organizations of its ten subordinate counties, since the summer, have organized cadres to go to the countryside. Leading cadres from the prefectural and county committees personally participated, combining production with disaster relief work, and conducted in-depth investigations and research. They discovered that the frequent disasters in the area were due to both objective reasons and problems in their work. The most important thing was that, in recent years, they had been satisfied with the results of large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, and universally neglected small-scale farmland water conservancy projects for preventing waterlogging and protecting seedlings. According to local chronicles and the memories of elderly farmers, there have been absolutely no instances of comprehensive disasters caused by drought in the area for decades. However, due to subjectivism and generalization in leadership work, coupled with the coercive commandism of cadres, the entire special district launched a "well-digging for drought prevention" campaign this spring, digging over 30,000 wells in total. As a result, these wells rarely worked, and some have already been silted up by water. Farmers had long had objections to this practice. Other examples include forcing farmers to plant late corn regardless of the late planting season; mechanically stipulating the number of plants per mu when advocating rational close planting; and promoting improved varieties introduced from other places on a large scale without testing. These practices caused considerable losses and aroused dissatisfaction among farmers. In addition, in terms of rural sideline occupations, most sideline production has also declined compared to the past.

Based on repeated investigations and research, the CCP Huaiyin Local Committee finally convened a meeting of county party secretaries, giving full play to democracy, realistically examining and assessing the achievements, shortcomings, and errors in past work, and putting forward guidelines and relatively practical measures for leading local agricultural production in the future. According to the decisions of the meeting, the entire special district will focus on water conservancy work in the future. Starting this winter, in addition to continuing to build the most urgent large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, the focus will be on building small-scale farmland water conservancy projects mainly for flood prevention. Of the special district’s more than 10 million mu of land prone to waterlogging, it is required that over 5 million mu be freed from the threat of waterlogging first this winter and spring, with the remainder to be completed within two or three years. In terms of production leadership, it is required to resolutely correct the single-minded approach, restore and develop rural sideline production such as breeding and weaving; and to continue to steadily and actively promote agricultural production reform.

Currently, Party organizations at the county, district, and lower levels in the Huaiyin Special District have begun to implement the decisions of the meeting, transform their leadership style, organize large numbers of work teams to go to the countryside and enter the cooperatives, combining production with disaster relief work, leading farmers in building farmland water conservancy projects, and developing agricultural and sideline production. They are determined to enrich these measures in practice together with the peasant masses and fundamentally change the local poverty situation.

### 淮阴地委调查当地农业生产不稳定的原因  找出改变当地贫困面貌的实际办法

    淮阴地委调查当地农业生产不稳定的原因
    找出改变当地贫困面貌的实际办法
    新华社清江28日电　中共江苏省淮阴地方委员会在调查研究和总结全年农业生产工作中，初步找出了当地农业生产不稳定的原因和领导当地农民改变贫困面貌的一些比较实际的措施。
    淮阴专区地处淮、沂、沭、泗等河流的下游，历来多灾。1949年以来，经过国家在这里投资先后整沭、导沂、治淮，基本上解除了一般的洪水威胁，但是涝灾还是几乎年年都有。全专区一千九百六十四万亩耕地，今年受涝面积就达到了一千二百多万亩。为了根本扭转这种局面，中共淮阴地方委员会和所属十个县的党组织从夏季以来分别组织干部下乡，由地委、县委负责干部亲自动手，结合生产救灾工作，作了深入的调查研究。他们发现，这个地区的经常受灾除了客观原因以外，工作中也有不少问题。最主要的是，几年来满足于大、中型水利工程的成效，普遍忽视防涝保苗的小型农田水利工程。根据地方志的记载和老年农民的回忆，几十年来当地因旱而全面成灾的情况绝无仅有。但是，由于领导工作中的主观主义和一般化，加上干部的强迫命令作风，今年春季全专区竟然发起“打井防旱”，一共打了三万多口井。结果，这些井很少起作用，而且有的已经被水淤塞。农民对这种做法早就有了意见。其他如不顾生产季节已经太晚，硬要农民种晚玉米；在提倡合理密植的时候，机械地规定每亩的株数；从外地引进的良种不经过试验就大面积推广等等。这些做法都造成不少损失，引起农民不满。此外在农村副业方面，多数副业生产也比过去下降了。
    根据反复调查研究的结果，中共淮阴地方委员会最后召开县委书记会议，充分发扬民主，实事求是地检查和估计了过去工作中的成绩、缺点和错误，并且提出了今后领导当地农业生产的方针和比较实际的措施。根据会议决定，今后全专区将以水利工作为重点。从今年冬季开始，除了继续建筑最迫切的大、中型水利工程以外，将着重兴修以防涝为主的小型农田水利工程。全专区一千多万亩容易受涝的田地，要求在今冬明春首先使五百多万亩免除涝灾的威胁，其余分别在两三年内完成。在生产领导方面，要求坚决纠正单打一的作风，恢复和发展饲养、编织等农村副业生产；要求继续稳步而又积极地推行农业生产改革。
    现在，淮阴专区各县、区以下的党的组织已经开始贯彻执行会议的决定，转变领导作风，组织大批工作组下乡入社，结合生产救灾工作，领导农民兴修农田水利，开展农业和副业生产。他们决心在实践中同农民群众一道充实这些措施，从根本上改变当地的贫困面貌。
