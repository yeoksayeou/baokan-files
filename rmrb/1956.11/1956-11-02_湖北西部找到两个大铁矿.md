Two Large Iron Ore Deposits Found in Western Hubei

(Reported by this newspaper) Geological prospecting teams affiliated with the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, after two years of arduous work, have discovered two large-scale iron ore deposits in western Hubei. One iron ore layer has an outcrop extending continuously for 25 kilometers, with an average thickness of about 2 meters. The vast majority is rich ore, and the preliminary estimate of reserves is 200 million tons. The other iron ore layer is distributed over a length of about 35 kilometers and a width of 17 kilometers, with an average thickness of about 3 meters. Among them, a 11-kilometer-long enrichment zone has an average thickness of more than 3.5 meters, and is almost entirely rich ore. The preliminary estimate of reserves is about 400 million tons. There are also many mineralized spots around and in the middle of these two mining areas, and it has been preliminarily determined that four areas are worth mining.

The proven reserves of these two mines can not only meet the needs of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant after expansion, but also can supply two or three large-scale steel plants for decades of smelting.

    湖北西部找到两个大铁矿
    本报讯　冶金工业部地质局所属的地质勘探队伍，经过两年的艰苦工作，在湖北西部找到了两个规模巨大的铁矿。有一处铁矿层露头连续延长二十五公里，平均厚二公尺左右，绝大部分是富矿，初步估计储量有两亿吨；另一处铁矿层分布长约三十五公里，宽十七公里，平均厚三公尺左右，其中有十一公里长的富集区平均厚度在三公尺半以上，差不多全部都是富矿，初步估计储量约四亿吨。在这两个矿区的外围和中间，还有许多矿化点，现已初步确定有四个地区有开采价值。
    这两个矿已经查明的储量不仅能够满足重庆钢铁厂扩建后的需要，并且可以供应两、三个大型钢铁厂冶炼几十年。
