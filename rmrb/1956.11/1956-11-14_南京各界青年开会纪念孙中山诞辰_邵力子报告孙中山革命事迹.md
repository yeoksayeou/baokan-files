Shao Lizi, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the 90th Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Birth, reported on the revolutionary deeds of Sun Yat-sen to more than 1,000 young people from all walks of life in Nanjing at the Nanjing Youth Commemoration Meeting for the 90th Anniversary of the Birth of the Great Revolutionary Sun Yat-sen on the evening of the 12th.

In his report, Shao Lizi focused on the development of Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary thought and encouraged the youth to learn from his spirit of continuous pursuit of progress and patriotism. He said that Sun Yat-sen encountered many failures in his life's revolutionary activities, but he was never discouraged and always forged ahead.

Shao Lizi also narrated a story about Sun Yat-sen's sympathy for the October Revolution. He said that after the October Revolution, some people in our country at that time were skeptical or even dissatisfied with the Soviet Union, but Sun Yat-sen always persuaded and struggled with these people.

He concluded by saying that Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary ideals have now been realized throughout the country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Young people today are very fortunate to live in this era and should work harder and make greater achievements in the various undertakings of building a socialist motherland.
