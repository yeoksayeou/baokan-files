Xinhua News Agency, November 28th: TASS, Damascus, November 28th: According to the Syrian "Al-Manar" newspaper, demonstrations were held in Iraq's Najaf province on the 26th, protesting the Iraqi government's participation in the imperialist conspiracy against Syria. Troops, acting on the orders of Prime Minister Said, confronted the demonstrators. As a result, twenty protesters were killed and hundreds were injured.

"Al-Manar" wrote that Said's actions in slaughtering demonstrators had written another dirty page in the ugly history of betraying the Arab people.

Xinhua News Agency, November 28th: According to Damascus Radio's broadcast on the 27th, a delegation of Iraqi political figures requested King Faisal to dissolve the Iraqi government headed by Nuri al-Said.

The delegation urged the King to appoint a new government "that can reflect the national demand focused on Iraq's withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact."

Damascus Radio said that in a letter to the King, the delegation stated that the Iraqi government should sever relations with Britain and France to protest their aggression against Egypt, and should prohibit the transport of Iraqi oil to Western Europe.

Xinhua News Agency, November 28th: Damascus dispatch: Syrian Prime Minister Sabri al-Asali announced in parliament on the evening of the 26th that he would issue a formal statement on the issue of Iraq providing a large number of weapons to conspirators to subvert the Syrian government.

A Syrian military spokesperson pointed out when exposing the Iraqi conspiracy last week that the arms were seized when Syria was preparing to stand with Egypt in the anti-imperialist struggle.

At the parliamentary meeting on the evening of the 26th, members strongly criticized the Iraqi government led by Nuri al-Said.

Akram al-Hawrani, leader of the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, said: "Mr. Said's government and the Baghdad Pact have plotted a conspiracy against Syria." He requested the government to expose the "serious criminal activities" carried out by Iraq at the recent Arab heads of state conference in Beirut. Independent parliamentarian Abdul Razzaq al-Nayyif demanded that the government sever diplomatic relations with Iraq.

Xinhua News Agency, November 28th: TASS, Damascus, November 27th: The Syrian public vehemently denounced the imperialist conspirators who are planning the criminal plot to overthrow Syria's current national system.

"Al-Nour" reported that the Syrian government has received tens of millions of telegrams demanding that the conspirators be severely punished.

    代表团促请国王任命一个“能反映集中在伊拉克退出巴格达条约问题上的全国要求”的新政府。
    大马士革电台说，代表团在给国王的意见书中说，伊拉克政府应当同英法断绝关系以抗议英法对埃及的进攻，而且应当禁止让伊拉克的石油运到西欧去。

    在议会26日晚举行的会议上，议员们猛烈抨击努里·赛义德领导的伊拉克政府。
