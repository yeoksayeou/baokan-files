    Don't Turn a Good Deed into a Bad One
    I am a planning staff member of the Central South Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering. Recently, we have been meeting with several construction units every day. The content of the discussions is about requesting the addition of new construction projects such as employee dormitories, canteens, and bathrooms in the fourth quarter. However, because the supply of materials is relatively tight this year, it is difficult to complete even the original planned projects, so most of the added projects cannot be constructed. We have explained these reasons in detail each time, but the construction units always insist on asking us to help solve the problem. They say that if there is no steel bar, bamboo reinforcement can be used, and if there is no bamboo reinforcement, bungalows can be built. Some units are even willing to hand over all the money to the construction company, as long as they get a few buildings by the end of the year.
    Why is this situation occurring? It turns out that since the central government proposed actively improving the material and cultural life of employees, many departments in charge allocated a basic construction investment for welfare to the factories and mines below in late September and early October, and stated that if it was not used up by the end of this year, it would all have to be turned over. The construction units, fearing that they would have to hand it over, were eager to spend the money before the end of the year. Some units even transferred a number of staff members, carrying money to purchase materials in various places, and some units even recruited civil engineering workers and extracted technical personnel from the production side to build on their own... In short, as long as the goal of spending all the money can be achieved.
    I think this is very inappropriate. Since the state has allocated investment, it must comprehensively consider the applicability, durability, and economy of the buildings. During construction, full preparations must be made in accordance with basic construction procedures, and it cannot be as crude as it is now. The state's senior leading organs should pay attention to this situation. In particular, the provision that "it must be used up by the end of the year, otherwise it will be turned over" should be further studied, or it should be clearly stipulated that the investment will still be allocated next year after it is turned over at the end of this year. Otherwise, not only will construction funds be wasted, but a good thing will be turned into a bad one. Tan Fushan

    不要把好事办坏了
    我是建筑工程部中南管理总局的计划工作人员。最近我们每天都要接谈几个兴建单位。接谈的内容都是要求在第四季度内增建职工宿舍、食堂、浴室等新的工程项目。但是因为今年材料供应比较紧张，原定计划都很难全部完成，所以增加项目大部分都不能施工。我们每次都把这些原因作了详细说明，但兴建单位总是坚持要求我们帮助解决。他们说，没有钢筋可以用竹筋，没有竹筋可以盖平房，有的单位甚至愿意把钱全部交给工程公司，只要年底给他们几栋房子就行了。
    为什么会产生这种情况呢？原来是自从中央提出积极改善职工的物质和文化生活以后，很多主管部在9月底和10月初拨给下面厂矿一笔有关福利方面的基本建设投资，并注明如果今年年底用不完就要全部上交。兴建单位唯恐上交，便急着要在年前把这笔钱花出去。有的单位甚至抽调了若干工作人员，携款到各地购买材料，有的单位更自己招揽土木工人，抽出生产方面的技术人员，自己营造……总之，只要能达到把钱花完的目的就行。
    我觉得这样作是十分不妥当的。国家既然拨出投资，就必须对于建筑物的适用、耐久和经济作全面考虑，在施工时必须按照基本建设程序作好充分的准备，不能像目前这样粗制滥造。国家的高级领导机关，应该重视这一情况。特别是对于“必须年底用完，否则上交”的规定，应该再作研究，或者明确规定今年年底上交后明年仍然给拨投资。否则不仅浪费了建设资金，而且会把好事情办坏了。　谭福山
