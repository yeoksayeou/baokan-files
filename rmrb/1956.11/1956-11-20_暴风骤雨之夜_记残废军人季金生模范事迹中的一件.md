    A Night of Storm and Rain
    ——An Account of a Model Deed by Disabled Veteran Ji Jinsheng
    By Our Correspondent Fu Dong
    Ji Jinsheng was sleeping soundly when he suddenly felt someone pushing him. He grunted a few times, turned over, and fell back asleep.

    He had been terribly tired these past few days. Every day, as soon as it was light, he would drag his legless body to the fields. In the evening, he would be busy checking the cooperative's accounts, and he wouldn't finish until late at night. As soon as his head hit the pillow, he knew nothing.

    This time the pushing was more insistent, and he vaguely heard someone shouting. Groggy, he opened his sleepy eyes and saw several people standing on the ground. What happened? Alarmed, he woke up.

    The chairman of the agricultural production cooperative, who was suffering from malaria, held out a trembling note that read: "On the evening of August 2, 1956, there will be a force twelve typhoon. All townships and agricultural production cooperatives should mobilize the villagers to reinforce their houses…"

    August 2nd, isn't that today? He steadied himself and was about to ask when he noticed that the two people standing on the ground were soaked from head to toe, as if they had just crawled out of the river. Ji Jinsheng recognized them. Both of them were members of the district committee. They must have come from the district, seven or eight *li* away, to deliver the notice.

    Seeing that Ji Jinsheng was awake, the two people gave a few instructions and hurried off to other places.

    Ji Jinsheng then realized that outside the window there was both wind and rain. The wind was so strong that it sounded like a plane flying right next to the window, and the rain was pouring down like bucket after bucket of water.

    He had to notify each production team immediately. But unfortunately, the chairman had not been feeling well these past two days, experiencing alternating bouts of fever and chills. Ji Jinsheng decided to go himself. But the chairman refused to allow it at any cost. In such heavy wind and rain, even young men would have difficulty walking, so how could Ji Jinsheng, who had no legs, manage?

    Ji Jinsheng also refused to give in, and their argument woke up his seventy-year-old grandmother. The old lady was extremely anxious and pointed at Ji Jinsheng, saying, "Relying on those three small stools to walk, I guarantee you won't be able to take more than a few steps before the wind blows you over!"

    Ji Jinsheng acted as if he didn't hear her. He put on a woolen coat, wrapped a towel around his head, and went out.

    He sat on a large stool, grabbed a small stool in each hand, and laboriously moved forward step by step.

    It was pitch black all around. He turned on his flashlight, bit it in his mouth for light.

    The wind was roaring, and the large poplar trees, more than a foot thick, looked as if they were about to fall. Facing into the wind, he could hardly breathe. The rain lashed directly at his face. Before he had walked for ten minutes, he was soaked through, and his body felt as heavy as if he were carrying a hundred *jin* of weight.

    The road was very narrow, only about a foot wide, and covered with mud, making it very slippery. The worst thing was that the ground was uneven – low on both sides and high in the middle. He lost his legs in the Liberation War, so it was already inconvenient for him to walk in normal times, let alone in such bad weather. Walking straight was impossible, so he walked sideways like a crab. There were many ditches along the way, the shallowest being two *chi* deep. He also had to be careful not to fall into them.

    As he was walking, his right hand suddenly slipped, and his body tilted to the side, breaking the strap on the stool he was sitting on. Losing his balance, he fell headfirst to the ground. The fall was not light, and it made his eyes see stars, his ears rang, and the ground seemed to sway beneath him.

    "Go back!" The thought flashed through his mind. Just then, he suddenly remembered the small typhoon a few days ago, which, although not big, had blown the roofs off more than a dozen thatched houses. He heard the old people in the village say that decades ago there had been a big typhoon that had blown down many houses and killed several people. "No, I can't go back!" He got up, groped to tie the rope, and continued to "walk" forward.

    The road became increasingly muddy. Before he had gone far, he fell again. In this way, he stumbled and staggered forward step by step. His right middle finger was injured when he hit the stool during a fall, causing excruciating pain. He gritted his teeth and kept "walking."

    As he walked, he thought. He thought of the Soviet legless flying general arduously learning to walk with artificial legs. He thought of the Liberation Army soldiers in the movie "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" crawling on cliffs where even wild beasts had not walked. He thought of the situation in November 1947 when fighting the Kuomintang at Chahe in northern Jiangsu. The environment at that time was much harsher than now. In one night, they had waded across three rivers, the water in the rivers was as freezing as ice, but none of the comrades complained. At the time of the general offensive, the enemy used eighty-seven light machine guns and three heavy machine guns to fire at our small number of soldiers. Batch after batch of soldiers sacrificed themselves, but in the end, we won the victory.

    What difficulty in the world could not be overcome? He felt strength in his body. He crawled for more than an hour in the storm.

    He arrived in front of the vice-chairman's house. The house was swaying in the wind, as if it were about to collapse. The thatch on the roof had long been blown away. A tree two or three *chi* thick in front of the door had its branches broken and hanging down.

    He used all his strength to shout for the vice-chairman. The vice-chairman, Ding Fukui, had just lost his wife. He was busy all day and had to take care of four young children when he returned in the evening, so he fell asleep as soon as he lay down. He had no idea of the storm outside.

    Ding Fukui opened his eyes and saw a person covered in mud from head to toe. For a moment, he did not recognize who it was. When he realized what was happening, he insisted that Ji Jinsheng not go out again. But Ji Jinsheng refused. Finally, they agreed that Ding Fukui would carry Ji Jinsheng to find the deputy director of sideline production and the director of production.

    The wind roared wildly, dragging out long howls. They walked and shouted, "A force twelve typhoon is coming! Everyone, get up quickly and reinforce your houses…"

    They came to a bridge. The bridge was more than four *zhang* long, two *chi* wide, and had no railings on either side. The bridge was smooth and slippery. They tried to take a step, but immediately slipped back. Ji Jinsheng looked at the rushing river water below the bridge and began to worry. It would be easy to slip and fall down while carrying him, and then both of them would surely die. What to do? They decided to crawl across separately. The bridge was so slippery that even Ding Fukui could not crawl steadily, let alone Ji Jinsheng. He crawled two steps forward and retreated one step.

    Finally, they reached the door of the deputy director of sideline production. The deputy director, who was in his fifties, did not have good eyesight and could not see clearly at night. But the old man was very active, so they split up and went to notify each production brigade.

    Ji Jinsheng and Ding Fukui went to the first and fourth brigades. When they passed the third brigade, they suddenly thought of Gu Enze's house. Gu's house was considered the worst in the whole village. It had long been rumored to be about to collapse. They wondered how it was now. They should go and take a look. As they approached Gu's house, they were terrified. The walls of Gu's house were already leaning, and there was a "crackling" sound. Gu Enze was still lying in bed, sound asleep, and his blind mother was groping and shouting in the room next door. The two of them held the wall and struggled for a long time before finally waking Gu Enze. Then, everyone hurriedly went to help the old lady. They had only taken five or six steps out the door when the house collapsed. How dangerous!

    Now Gu Enze carried Ji Jinsheng to the first brigade to shout from door to door. For families without young men, he mobilized others to help drive stakes and tie the houses with ropes.

    Ji Jinsheng did not return home until four o'clock in the morning. His throat was completely hoarse, and he could not say a word. His body was frozen blue and purple, and he was still shivering under the covers.

    He had just closed his eyes for a moment when dawn broke. The cadres came to report. As soon as they entered the door, they said: Most people have never seen such a big wind in their lives. The wind uprooted trees more than three *chi* thick in the village. But not many houses were damaged. Only five collapsed completely. No one was injured or killed. The villagers all said that it was thanks to Comrade Ji Jinsheng last night. If they hadn't taken action early, eighty-six houses in the cooperative would have been in danger.

    "Although Ji Jinsheng's legs are disabled, can you say he is 'useless'? He does more than people with strong bodies! In 1954, he led us to drain water and rescue crops. Last year, he led us to establish the cooperative…" When the members introduced Ji Jinsheng to others, they always said this.

    Ji Jinsheng, this man beloved by the local people, lives in Nantong County, Jiangsu Province. He is the supervisor of the Third Agricultural Production Cooperative of Shuanglou Township and also a member of the general branch committee of Shuanglou Township and the branch secretary of the second and third cooperatives.

    暴风骤雨之夜
    ——记残废军人季金生模范事迹中的一件
    本报记者　傅冬
    季金生睡得正香，忽然觉得有人在推他。他哼了几声，翻了个身又睡着了。
    这些天他累得要命。每天天刚亮，他就拖着没有腿的身子到地里去。晚上又忙着查社里的账，而且一弄就到大半夜。他头一落枕头，就什么也不知道了。
    这一次推得更厉害了，他耳朵里隐隐约约地听见有人在喊。他迷迷糊糊睁开惺松的眼，看见地下站着好几个人。发生了什么事？心里一惊，醒过来了。
    正在打摆子的农业生产合作社社长，伸着颤抖的手递过来个条子，上面写着：1956年8月2日晚有十二级台风，各乡各农业生产合作社应动员老乡把房子扎固……
    8月2日，不就是今天？他定了定神正要问，忽然注意到地下站的两个人浑身上下都是水，就像刚从河里爬出来一样。季金生认得他们。这两人都是区委委员。他们一定是从七、八里外的区里赶来送通知的。
    这两个人见季金生醒了，嘱咐了几句，就赶着到别处去了。
    季金生这时发觉窗外又是风又是雨，风大得像飞机在窗子跟前飞，雨大得像一桶一桶的水往下倒。
    得马上通知各生产队。可是真不巧，社长这两天身上不好过，一阵热一阵冷。季金生决定自己去。但社长说什么都不肯。这样大的风雨，年青的小伙子走起来都困难，没有腿的季金生怎能行呢？
    季金生也不肯让步，两人吵得把七十多岁的老祖母给嚷醒了。老太太急得不得了，指着季金生说：“靠你那三个小板凳走路，保管你出去走不了几步，就给风吹倒了！”
    季金生好像没听见，穿了件绒衣，头上包了块手巾，就出去了。
    他坐在大板凳上，一只手抓着一个小板凳，艰难地一步一步往前挪。
    四周黑漆漆的。他把手电打开，咬在嘴里照亮。
    风在咆哮着，吹得一尺多粗的大杨树都像要倒似的。又是顶风，他连气都难透出来。雨又直冲脸上打。还没有走上十分钟，他全身就湿透了，身上重得像背了百十斤东西。
    路很窄，只一尺来宽，上面又全是泥，滑溜溜的。最糟糕的是地不平——两边低中间高。他在解放战争中失去了双腿，本来平时走路就很不方便，何况又碰上这样的坏天气。直着走是不可能的了，他就横着像螃蟹一样走。路上沟很多，最浅的也有二尺深。他还要随时留心不要跌进去。
    走着走着，不小心右手突然一滑，身子向旁斜了斜，把挂在身上的那个坐板凳上的带子拉断了，身子失去了平衡，头冲着地栽了去。这一栽可不轻，摔得他眼睛直冒火星，耳朵嗡嗡乱响，地也仿佛在身子下晃荡起来。
    “回去吧！”他脑子里闪过了这么一个念头。就在这时，他忽然想起了前几天的那股小台风，虽然不大，还吹掉了十几间草房的屋顶。听村里的老年人说，几十年前有一次大台风，吹倒很多房子，压死好些人。“不，不能回去！”他爬起来，摸索着把绳子结好，又继续向前“走”。
    路上越来越泥了，没走多远，他又摔倒了。就这样，他摔摔跌跌地一点一点往前挨。右手的中指在摔跤时碰到凳子上扭了筋，痛得要死，他咬紧牙关不停地“走”。
    他一面走，一面想。他想起了苏联无脚飞将军在用假腿艰苦地学习走路的情景。他想起了电影“智取华山”中的解放军战士在野兽也没走过的悬崖上爬行的情景。他想起了1947年11月在苏北岔河打国民党时的情景。那时的环境比现在要苦得多。一夜之间，淌过了三条河，河里的水像冰一样冻人，但同志们没一个叫苦。到总攻的时候，敌人用八十七挺轻机枪和三挺重机枪对着我们人数不多的战士射击，一批一批的战士牺牲了，可是最后我们赢得了胜利。
    天下还有什么不能克服的困难？他觉得身上有了力量。就这样他在狂风暴雨里爬了一个多钟头。
    他来到副社长的房子前面。这房子在风里摇摇摆摆，像要倒下来的样子。房上的草早被吹光了。门前一棵二、三尺粗的树，树枝也都被风打断倒挂下来。
    他用尽全身的力量喊副社长。副社长丁福奎刚死了女人，白天忙一天，晚上回来还要照顾四个小孩子，一躺下就睡熟了，外面风雨这么大，他都一点不知道。
    丁福奎睁开眼，看见一个从上到下浑身是泥的人，一时竟没有认出是谁。等他弄清楚是怎么回事的时候，他坚持不让季金生再出去。可是季金生不肯。最后商量好丁福奎背着季金生去找副业主任和生产主任。
    大风拖着长长的呼啸声在疯狂地叫着。他们一路走一路喊：“十二级台风来了，大家快起来整房子……”
    他们走到一个桥跟前。这桥有四丈多长，二尺来宽，两边又没有栏杆。桥上又光又滑，他们试着走了一步，但马上就滑了回来。季金生看着桥下像万马奔腾的河水，发起愁来。背着走很容易滑倒跌下去的，那样两人的命准都没了。怎么办呢？他们决定分开爬着走。桥滑溜得厉害，丁福奎都爬不稳，季金生更别说了，他爬两步，退一步。
    总算挨到了副业主任的家门。五十多岁的副业主任眼睛不大行，夜里看不清道。可是老头儿挺积极，他们便分头到各生产大队去通知。
    季金生和丁福奎到一、四大队去。当他们走过三大队的时候，忽然想起古恩泽的家。古家的房子在全村讲算是最坏的。老早就听说要倒，这阵不知怎样了？该去看看。当他们快走到古家跟前时，吓得心直跳。古家的墙已经歪了，而且“啪啪”乱响。古恩泽却还躺在床上，呼呼大睡，他的瞎了眼的母亲正在隔壁地下乱摸乱喊。他们两人用手扶着墙，费了半天劲好不容易才把古恩泽叫醒。接着大伙就急急忙忙去搀老太太。等他们刚出门走了只五、六步，房子就倒下来了。好险呵！
    现在古恩泽背着季金生到一大队去挨门挨户地喊。家里没青年男子的，他就动员别的人来帮忙打桩、用绳子扎房子。
    季金生一直忙到早晨四点钟才回到家里。他的嗓子完全哑了，一句话也说不出来了。浑身冻成青紫的，躺在被子里还冷得直打颤。
    他刚阖了一下眼，天就亮了。干部们来汇报。大伙一进门就说：好些人长了那么大还没有见过这么大的风，风把村里三尺多粗的树连根拔起。可是房子却没有坏多少，全塌的只有五间。人没有一个伤亡。老乡们都说昨晚多亏了季金生同志，要不是动手动得早，社里有八十六间房子不保险。
    “季金生虽然腿残了，可是你能说他‘废’了吗？他做的事比身体健壮的人还要多呢！1954年领导我们排水、抢救庄稼，去年领导我们成立了合作社……”社员们给人介绍季金生的时候，总是这样说。
    季金生，这个被当地人民热爱的人，住在江苏省南通县，他是双楼乡第三农业生产合作社的监察主任，又是双楼乡的总支委员兼二、三社分支书记。
