To run worker technical schools well, cultivate a large number of skilled technical workers, and meet the needs of national construction is a new and important task. However, we must also prevent blindly launching hasty and rash plans for worker technical schools. According to statistics from eighteen ministries and commissions including industry, transportation, construction, geology, and labor, by the end of this year, worker technical schools will reach 232, with 130,000 students. This includes nearly twenty majors and one hundred and several dozen types of work. This number is very large, but the quality is often not satisfactory.

Currently, some teachers and students have an incorrect or incomplete understanding of the nature and role of worker technical schools, and therefore their morale is not normal. For example, some teachers believe that teaching in worker technical schools "has no future"; some students, especially junior high school graduates, believe that being a technical worker is the state "using pillars as firewood" and "not honorable." Therefore, they are not at ease with their work and study. If these problems are not resolved quickly, they will seriously affect the improvement of teaching quality and bring losses to the national construction. Therefore, local Party committees and the Communist Youth League must strengthen ideological leadership over worker technical schools.

Due to China's industrial backwardness, the existing technical workers are not only insufficient in number, but also have low cultural and technical levels, which are not adapted to the needs of the state. In order to change this situation, in addition to actively finding ways to improve the cultural and technical level of existing workers, it is also necessary to replenish the working class with new blood and enable a large number of young people to directly participate in industrial production. Worker technical schools are a new type of school that has emerged to meet this new requirement. Therefore, the view that worker technical schools "have no future" is incorrect, and it is also inappropriate to require it to meet the standards of general schools.

Party organizations and the Communist Youth League should clearly explain to every young student that mastering one or several modern technologies and engaging in productive labor is one of the glorious futures for junior high school graduates. Junior high school students have a higher cultural level, are older, and physically stronger than primary school students. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to require junior high school students to participate in productive labor. At the same time, in recent years, the number of junior high school students has been increasing year by year, while the number of high school students recruited by the state is limited. It is estimated that in addition to those who are admitted to high schools and secondary technical schools, there will be a large surplus of junior high school students graduating next summer vacation. The normal outlet for this part of the students is to participate in industrial production through worker technical schools, or to directly participate in industrial, agricultural and other various labor. In the past few years, young students who have entered production have generally made rapid progress. They have quickly mastered technology and become the backbone of production, and many have been selected as advanced producers. Engaging in productive labor is the most glorious thing, it can not only give you labor skills and create wealth for society, but also cultivate people's noble qualities. After young students participate in productive labor, they can learn various skills in production, learn culture and improve their technical level in their spare time, and some young workers still have the opportunity to apply for various universities when conditions permit. Going from school to factories and rural areas, and then from factories and rural areas to school, will become the path that many young people will take in the future.

In addition to book knowledge, students in technical schools must undergo a considerable period of production practice to actually master operational techniques. In order to ensure the improvement of teaching quality, Party organizations should ensure that student internship work is done well. The relevant competent departments should include the production internship tasks of worker technical schools in the national plan. For some students who go to factories for internships, the factory Party organizations and administrative departments should provide them with various convenient conditions, give them as much opportunity for independent operation as possible, promptly solve the difficulties in their internships, and ensure the completion of the teaching plan.

Party organizations must help technical schools improve their leadership style and create good learning conditions for students as much as possible. School leaders should be very concerned about the lives of teachers and students, manage food well under existing conditions, make some appropriate adjustments to dormitories, improve teaching quality, and "patiently teach and never be tired" to students, overcoming and preventing bad work styles of treating students with a rude attitude. Establish and improve the school system on a conscious basis. Party organizations should strengthen political and ideological work for teachers, improve their awareness, give full play to their enthusiasm, and promptly absorb outstanding members among them into the Party. The work of the Communist Youth League occupies an indispensable position in the political work of worker technical schools. The Party should strengthen the leadership of the Communist Youth League, break down closed-doorism, absorb qualified young people into the League, unite all the young people in the school, and enliven school life. The League organizations should also educate the vast number of young students to carry forward the style of diligence, thrift, hard work, and simplicity, and with the attitude of being masters, actively help the school leadership overcome difficulties and shortcomings, achieve unity between teachers and students, and complete teaching tasks.

Leadership over worker technical schools must be strengthened, and leadership relations must be unified. Some technical schools have been in a state of "no one caring" for a long time, and this must be overcome quickly. Local Party committees should strengthen the political and ideological leadership of worker technical schools, conscientiously manage the cadres and Party organizational life in these schools, and instruct the relevant departments of the Party to regularly understand and help their work. At the same time, it should be pointed out that some departments subjectively set up very large worker technical schools under extremely inadequate conditions (teachers, equipment, dormitories), which caused many problems. This kind of blind and rash approach must be prevented in the future. All relevant departments should conduct a practical inspection of the worker technical schools under their respective ministries in the near future, and in cooperation with the relevant departments of the local Party committees, conscientiously solve the various problems currently existing in these schools, and run the worker technical schools well.

### 对技工学校要抓紧领导

    对技工学校要抓紧领导
    办好工人技术学校，培养大批熟练的技术工人，满足国家建设的需要，是一项新的重要的工作。但是，我们也必须防止盲目地举办工人技术学校的急躁冒进的计划。目前根据工业、交通、建筑、地质和劳动等十八个部统计，到今年年底止，工人技术学校将达到二百三十二所，在校学生将达到十三万人。其中包括近二十种专业，一百几十种工种。这个数量是很大的了，而质量就往往不能令人满意。
    目前有部分教员和学生，对工人技术学校的性质和作用认识不正确或不完全正确，因而情绪不够正常。如有的教员认为在工人技术学校教书“没有前途”；有的学生特别是初中毕业生，认为当一个技术工人是国家“把栋梁当做了烧火棍”“不光彩”。因此，他们不安心工作，不安心学习。这些问题如果不迅速解决，势必严重影响到教学质量的提高，给国家建设事业带来损失。因此，各地党委和青年团必须加强对工人技术学校的思想领导。
    由于我国工业落后，现有技术工人，不但数量不足，而且，文化和技术水平不高，与国家要求极不适应。为了改变这种状况，除了积极设法提高现有工人文化技术水平之外，还必须给工人阶级补充新的血液，使大批青年直接参加工业生产。工人技术学校是适应这种新的要求而产生的一种新型学校。因此，认为工人技术学校“没有前途”的看法是不对的，拿一般学校的标准来要求它也是不妥当的。
    党组织和青年团应该向每一个青年学员讲清楚，掌握一种或数种现代化技术，从事生产劳动，是初中毕业学生光荣前途之一。初中学生比高小学生的文化水平较高，年龄较大，体力较强，因此，要求初中学生参加到生产劳动中来是完全必要的。同时，近年来初中学生逐年增加，而国家招收高中学生的数字是有一定限度的。估计明年暑假毕业的初中学生除了考入高中和中等技术学校以外，将有大批的剩余。这一部分学生正常的出路就是通过工人技术学校参加工业生产，或直接参加工业、农业及其他各种劳动。几年来投入生产的青年学生一般进步很快，他们迅速掌握了技术，变成了生产中的骨干，不少人被选为先进生产者。从事生产劳动是最光荣的事情，它不仅可以给你劳动技能，为社会创造财富，而且，还可以培养人们的高尚品质。青年学生参加生产劳动以后，在生产中可以学会各种技能，在业余时间可以学习文化和提高技术水平，而且还有一部分青年工人在条件许可的时候仍有投考各种高等学校的机会。由学校到工厂、农村，再由工厂、农村到学校，这将成为今后许多青年所要走的道路。
    技工学校的学生，除了书本知识之外，必须经过相当长时间的生产实习，才能实际掌握操作技术。为了保证教学质量的提高，党组织应该保证把学生实习工作作好。有关的主管部门应该把工人技术学校的生产实习任务列入国家计划之内。对于一部分到工厂实习的学生，工厂党组织和行政方面要给他们以各种便利的条件，尽量给以独立操作的机会，及时解决他们实习中的困难，保证完成教学计划。
    党组织必须帮助技工学校改进领导作风，尽可能给学生创造良好的学习条件。学校的领导干部应该十分关心教员和学生的生活，要在现有条件下，把伙食管好，把宿舍适当作一些调整，提高教学质量，对学生“循循善诱，诲人不倦”，克服和防止以粗暴态度对待学生的坏作风。在自觉的基础上建立与健全学校的制度。党组织对于教员应加强政治思想工作，提高他们的觉悟，充分发挥他们的积极性，把他们中间的优秀分子及时吸收到党内来。团的工作在工人技术学校的政治工作中占有不可忽视的地位。党应该加强对青年团的领导，打破关门主义，把够条件的青年吸收到团内来，团结全校青年，活跃学校生活。团组织还应该教育广大青年学生，发扬克勤克俭艰苦朴素的作风，以主人翁的态度，积极地帮助学校领导上克服困难，克服缺点，做到师生团结，完成教学任务。
    对工人技术学校的领导必须加强，领导关系必须统一。有些技工学校长期处于“三不管”的状态，必须赶紧克服。各地方党委应当加强对于工人技术学校的政治思想领导，认真管理这些学校里的干部和党的组织生活，责成党的有关部门经常了解和帮助他们的工作。同时，应当指出某些部门在条件（师资、设备、宿舍）极不具备的情况下，主观地办起了很大的工人技术学校，因而发生了许多问题，这种盲目冒进的作法，今后必须防止。各有关部门应在最近期间，对各部所属的工人技术学校进行一次切实的检查，协同当地党委有关部门，认真解决目前在这些学校中存在的各项问题，把工人技术学校办好。
