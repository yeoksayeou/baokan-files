    The Struggle to Resume Work
    By Our Correspondent Hu Sisheng

    “When will the factories resume work?” This is a serious problem facing the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government and Budapest, and also a complex struggle they face.

    After two meetings between Premier Kádár of the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government and representatives of the Budapest Central Workers' Council, the opinions from the central government to the workers' councils of various factories were unified. For the benefit of the country and the nation, the call was first made to mobilize workers to resume work, and some unresolved issues would be gradually resolved after work resumed. To this end, the Central Workers' Council called on workers to resume work on the 19th. This is an important and correct decision.

    How is this decision being implemented? With this question in mind, I went to the State Railway Locomotive Factory at noon on the 19th. On the way, I learned that this factory is one of the largest factories in Hungary, producing various electric and steam locomotives, water pumps, bridges, etc. This factory produces not only for domestic use but also for foreign countries. For example, it is currently manufacturing steel beams for the Nile Bridge in Egypt. The factory employs 10,000 workers.

    At 2:00 PM, we arrived at the factory in the 8th district. From the outside, the factory area showed no signs of damage, and black smoke billowed from the chimneys. Upon entering the main gate, workers were leaving in succession, and guards were checking everyone's documents at the entrance. Only then did I learn that, due to the lack of transportation and to ensure safety, the factory was operating on a single shift, stopping work after 2:00 PM.

    “Today, 3,000 workers came to work, mainly from the forging workshop, the foundry workshop, and the bridge-building workshop, accounting for 30% of the factory's workers. If we count from October 23rd, today is the day with the highest number of workers. The remaining workers have not yet come to work for two reasons: one reason is transportation. About 40% of our factory's workers live in the suburbs, but urban transportation has not yet recovered. Another reason is that some people are still inciting workers not to resume work.” The factory director, Gustav, in his fifties, told us in a refined meeting room. As soon as he finished speaking, the chairman of the factory's workers' council, Gubos, continued, "The main task of the workers' council now is to resume work. To this end, we are mobilizing workers to come to work and providing material guarantees, such as food."

    From the conversation with the chairman of the workers' council, we learned that there were some unidentified people carrying out activities in the factory. He said: "Now there are some people in our factory that no one knows. Some claim to be from Csepel Island (an industrial area in Budapest), encouraging workers not to come to work, saying that the workers in Csepel have not gone to work either. Some people even threaten us, saying: 'Don't mobilize workers to come to work, be careful yourselves. London Radio says that many members of the workers' council have been arrested.'" He smiled and then said: "Therefore, we are now preparing to issue new certificates to the workers. Those without certificates will not be allowed to enter the factory." "The purpose of these counter-revolutionaries is to overthrow the government. Now that they cannot take up arms, they want to do everything possible to intimidate workers not to resume work, and they want to drag down the government by stopping production," the factory director added.

    I then learned that the workers' council of this factory, with forty members, was established on October 26th, and not all the workers were present at the time of its establishment. Therefore, Gubos also told me, "After all the workers come to work in the future, a secret ballot will be used to re-elect the workers' council. The current workers' council is temporary." In addition, he also mentioned that the factory is now organizing a workers' self-defense force, whose main task is to maintain order and security.

    After talking for more than an hour, the factory director said that he wanted to go back and see his family, as it would be unsafe if he was too late, and the chairman of the workers' council had a meeting, so we said goodbye and left.

    On the way back, the sun was already setting, but there were still many pedestrians on the street. I got a copy of the newly published "Hungarian Defense Forces" newspaper, which said that although not all the workers in Budapest's major factories had gone to work, some had already started working. For example, most of the workers in the Hungarian Steel Machinery Factory had gone to work. From the shutdown of major factories to the partial resumption of work, this is a turning point. This turning point was produced in struggle, and its further changes until the fundamental turning point will also be full of struggle.

### 复工的斗争

    复工的斗争
    本报记者　胡思升
    “什么时候工厂复工？”这是匈牙利工农革命政府和布达佩斯面临的一个严重的问题，也是面临的一场复杂的斗争。
    经过工农革命政府总理卡达尔同布达佩斯中央工人委员会代表的两次会谈，从中央到各厂的工人委员会的意见都一致了。为了国家和民族的利益，先号召和动员工人复工，有些没有解决的问题待复工后再逐步解决。为此，中央工人委员会号召工人在19日恢复工作。这是一个重要的和正确的决定。
    这个决定实现的情况怎样呢？我带着这样的问题在19日中午去国家铁路机车工厂。在路上，了解到这个工厂是匈牙利大工厂之一，生产各种电气和蒸气机车，抽水机、桥梁等，这个工厂不仅为国内，而且也为国外生产，例如它现在正为埃及尼罗河大桥制造钢梁。这个工厂有一万工人。
    下午两点钟，我们到达位于第八区的这个工厂，从外表看来，这个工厂区没有什么破坏的痕迹，黑烟滚滚地从烟囱内冒出来。走进正门，工人们正陆续出门，警卫在门口检查每人的证件。这时才了解到，由于交通工具的缺乏和为了保证安全，工厂实行一班制，下午二时后就停止工作了。
    “今天上工的有三千工人，主要是锻压车间、铸造车间和造桥车间，占全厂工人的30％，如果从10月23日算起，今天是上工人数最多的一次。其余的工人至今没有上工的原因有两个：“一个原因是交通问题，我们厂里约有40％以上的工人住在郊外，但现在城市交通还没有恢复，另一个原因是有人还在煽动工人不要复工。”厂长古斯塔夫五十上下年纪，在一间精致的会议室同我们谈起来。他刚说完，这个厂的工人委员会主席古博斯接下去说：“现在工人委员会的主要工作是为了复工。为此，我们动员工人上工，并提供了物质保证，如食物等。”
    从工人委员会主席的谈话中，我们了解到工厂里都有一些身份不明的人在进行活动，他说：“现在在我们工厂里有一些谁也不认识的人，有的自称是切佩尔岛（这是布达佩斯的一个工业区）来的，鼓动工人不要上工，说切佩尔的工人也没有上班。有的人甚至还威胁我们说：你们不要动员工人上工，你们自己要小心，伦敦广播说，许多工人委员会委员都被捕了。”说到这里，他笑了一笑后又说：“因此，现在我们准备在工人中间颁发新的证件，没有证件的就不准进入厂内。”“这些反革命分子目的是想推翻政府，他们现在不能拿起武器，就想用尽办法来恐吓工人不要复工，想用生产停顿的办法来拖垮政府。”厂长又补充了这一段话。
    接着我又了解到，这个厂的拥有四十个委员的工人委员会是10月26日成立的，成立的时候并不是全部工人都在场。因此，古博斯又告诉我说：“等将来工人都上工后将用秘密投票方式重新选举，现在的工人委员会是临时的。”此外，他还提到，现在工厂在组织工人自卫队，主要的任务是维持秩序和安全。
    谈了一个多小时，厂长说他要回去看看他的家，再迟了不太安全，而工人委员会主席因为有会议，我们就告辞了出来。
    在回来的时候，夕阳已经西照，可是街上行人还很多。我拿到了一张刚出的“匈牙利国防军”报，知道布达佩斯主要工厂虽然不是所有的工人都已上工，但都已开始有工人上工了，像匈牙利钢铁机器工厂已有大部分工人上工。从主要工厂的停工到部分复工，这是一个转折。这个转折是在斗争中产生的，它的进一步变化直到根本的转折也将充满了斗争。
