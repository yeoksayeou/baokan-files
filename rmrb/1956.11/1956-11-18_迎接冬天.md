Welcoming Winter
By Our Correspondent Shen Shi

In late September, the Karamay oil region was hit by a gale that collapsed more than fifty tents pitched on the Gobi Desert. Wooden-pole tents were naturally out of the question, but even steel-frame tents had their steel beams bent. In the newly built houses, the glass on the windward side was shattered, and some of the iron-sheet roofs were blown away.

The gale issued a warning to the people of the Karamay Mining Bureau: the harsh winter on the Gobi is merciless.

The gale heightened people's vigilance. The original plan to use cotton tents for the winter at the more distant construction sections was changed to dugouts. The original plan to wait until the entire forty-kilometer water pipeline was completed before releasing water was changed to releasing water in sections. The heads of the Mining Bureau went to the construction sections to inspect the preparations for cold protection and insulation. Zhang Wenbin, Director of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration Bureau, also went to Hoboksar Mongol Autonomous County to discuss coal transportation with the leaders of the Autonomous County People's Committee. The gale urged people to prepare for winter at a faster pace, from walking quickly to running.

One evening, a narrow dugout at the Karamay Mining Bureau was filled with people. The electric light emitted a weak, pale yellow glow, and moths kept flying towards the light. The dugout was filled with smoke, and the air was filled with the unpleasant smell of cigarettes. Among those present were the heads of the Mining Bureau, the newly arrived Party Secretary, and the slender Chief Engineer of the Mining Bureau. Comrade Zhi Jingyao, Director of the Mining Bureau, said in a low and slow voice: "There are only two months left before the snowfall. We must make good preparations for the winter in this short period of time..."

Welcoming winter is a heavy burden. At this time, the exploration area has expanded. The distant construction sections are more than a hundred kilometers apart, and the closer ones are thirty to forty kilometers apart. Dozens of exploratory wells are scattered like stars on an area of ​​three thousand square kilometers. The oil region already has tens of thousands of people, and the demand for engineering and domestic water is large. The monthly water supply is not tens or hundreds of tons, but more than ten thousand tons. The oil region has developed so quickly and so rapidly, bringing about a myriad of problems.

Although the face of the oil region is changing rapidly, its geographical and transportation conditions are not well adapted to its development. Karamay is located on the northwestern edge of the Junggar Basin, far from the city. Here, it is just a Gobi Desert and barren land covered with drought-resistant plants. The newly discovered oil fields have started from scratch. Even a toothbrush or a wooden board must be transported from afar. Even the drinking water source is forty kilometers away, so it is no wonder that people here think that water is the most precious thing.

At this time, the highway from Dushanzi to Karamay was not yet open. The ten-ton diesel trucks transferred from Yumen, which could originally travel ninety kilometers per hour, were truly useless here. On such roads, these trucks would either have their steel plates broken or their engines malfunctioning after a few trips, and the repair workers would not know how to repair these trucks! At this time, the forty-kilometer water pipeline from the Manas River to Karamay had just been surveyed, and no one could be found to design the water intake. At this time, of the more than one hundred houses planned to be built, only twenty or so had been completed, and many people were still sleeping in tents. At this time, the boilers ordered from the Northeast had not yet arrived, and the boilers ordered from abroad had not yet been shipped, while the exploratory wells were waiting to install these boilers! Comrade Zhi Jingyao said at the meeting: "At this critical moment, we must maintain a calm mind." Indeed, like housing, vegetable cellars, coal, grain, well insulation, people's cold protection equipment..., the problems, large and small, are intricate and complex, requiring the leaders of the Mining Bureau to maintain a calm mind to consider various issues thoroughly and meticulously. If any of these tasks is neglected, if any of them is out of sync, it may affect winter production and it may affect people's safety. He, the leader of the Mining Bureau, is responsible for every worker.

Ma Jixiang, Director of the Drilling Department, reminded those present that workers in the Hongshanzui construction section had already fallen ill from the cold. He was anxious about the boilers that had not yet arrived. Comrade Ma Jixiang had been to Karamay last year. When drilling the first and second wells, he and the workers spent their first winter here. He had a deep understanding of the harsh winter here. When the cold air passed through, the biting whirlwind rolled up snowflakes and flew all over the sky. The earth was covered with snow. When you stepped on it in felt boots, the snow covered your knees. When the second well was being drilled, a blowout occurred. The water sprayed from the exploratory well fell on the drilling platform, and the drilling platform solidified into an ice hill. Sprayed on the derrick, the derrick turned into an ice tower. The workers chiseled through the solid ice from the bottom of the derrick and drilled in to rescue. Their cotton clothes were splashed wet and immediately froze into ice. He would never forget the hard winter field life. Now, the number of workers in the Drilling Department has increased. Unlike the first winter, there are only one or two drilling teams operating in the field. Many of these newly added workers have not yet experienced the harsh winter here. Thinking of them, his sense of responsibility naturally increases.

The news that workers in the Hongshanzui construction section were falling ill from the cold made Zhang Zhilin, First Secretary of the Karamay Mining Bureau Committee of the Communist Party of China, feel uncomfortable. He said to those present: "We must care for people, care for everyone. We must ensure that no one is frozen in winter." Although Comrade Zhang Zhilin had only been to Karamay for a few days, and he was still a layman to drilling and well testing, he had visited several construction sites and contacted many workers. When he saw the Uyghur and Kazakh workers eating in the canteen opened for ethnic minority workers, he could not drink tea or eat meat. He sighed and said: "Our comrades still don't know how to do people's work, and they often ignore the living habits of ethnic minorities." He usually talked with his comrades and found that some people lacked confidence in preparing for the winter. He said at this meeting: "It is indeed difficult to get through the winter. However, in the face of difficulties, we must not lose confidence. As long as we rely on the workers, mobilize everyone, and think of more ways, the difficulties can be overcome." Indeed, in the face of difficulties, some comrades often feel helpless, and some sit in the office, staring and always waiting, waiting for materials and equipment, waiting to add more people. They seem not to see the workers in front of them, nor to discover their wisdom and strength. Comrade Qin Feng, Deputy Director of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration Bureau, criticized this idea at the meeting. He cited some things that could be done to mobilize the workers. Like poor roads, insufficient transportation capacity, and high vehicle consumption, drivers can be mobilized to find ways to tap transportation potential; like the insulation of exploratory wells, in the case of insufficient wood, it is not necessary to install wooden boards around the bottom of the derrick, reeds can be used instead, and there are plenty of reeds on the banks of Ailik Lake and Manas River. He said: "Waiting will not get us through the winter. Time will not wait for us, nor will it allow us to wait."

The meeting brought new vitality to the Karamay oil region. Previously, people were slowly welcoming winter, and now they are starting to move at a faster pace. Drilling teams, well testing teams, derrick installation teams, transportation stations, mud testing laboratories... began to check the preparations for the winter. What has been done, what is still lacking, what can be solved by ourselves, and what cannot be solved locally, so that the heads of various departments have a clear understanding. The workers use their spare time to go to the Manas River and Ailik Lake to cut reeds in batches. Everyone is moving.

On the construction site of the highway from Dushanzi to Karamay, workers and soldiers are building the last few kilometers of the road. Engineer Weng Lirou, with a pale face and wearing black-rimmed glasses, goes back and forth to the construction site all day long to direct the road construction. Those graduates from Nanjing, Xi'an and Chongqing highway engineering schools live with the workers. They left the big cities and lived on the Gobi Desert all summer, sleeping in tents and drinking turbid water. They saw the cars driving on the bumpy roads, like a thorn in their hearts. In early September, this section of the highway was opened, and they moved to a new construction site with a sense of victory.

From the Manas River to Karamay, drivers transported seamless steel pipes with a diameter of eight inches. The pipeline installation workers from Yumen welded the steel pipes section by section. The welded steel pipes lay like black pythons on the wilderness of the Junggar Basin. Maimaiti Niyazi and his apprentice Yang Guoyou took turns driving a twenty-ton ditch digging machine, digging a two-meter-deep trench along the direction of the steel pipe laying on the Gobi Desert full of pebbles and boulders. After the water pipe was welded, it was coated with asphalt and buried in the trench.

Less than one kilometer from the foothills of Genghis Khan Mountain, the newly built houses look like a small town from a distance. The pink, yellow, and white walls are painted with colored soil produced locally. At night, bright electric lights shine from every window. The vast majority of workers have moved into their new homes. The more distant construction sections are also rushing to build dugouts for the workers to spend the winter. Who would have thought that in just half a year, the desolate Gobi Desert, which had been sleeping for thousands of years, could be decorated so differently by the diligent hands of male and female soldiers of the production and construction corps!

For each exploratory well being drilled, the newly transported boilers have been installed. The workers weave the cut reeds into reed mats, surround the bottom of the derrick, nail them firmly with wooden boards, and apply a layer of clay inside and out. Behind the drilling platform, the mud pool and the diesel engine installation area are made into small houses with wooden pillars and reeds. In this way, in winter, the workers can be less exposed to the cold wind when operating on the drilling platform, and the mud pool will not freeze.

In mid-October, Comrade Zhang Zhilin went to the exploratory well on the Manas River to check the cold protection and insulation work. He saw that the workers had put on cotton clothes rushed out by the sewing workers in Urumqi. In their dormitory, he saw felt boots transported from Tacheng and Yining under the bed. In the kitchen, there were vegetables supplied from various farms in the Manas River Basin. He said to the workers: "So many people are caring for us and supporting us. We cannot let them down!"

Right on the Manas River, some workers used their spare time to cut back reeds, cut down wild sand jujube trees, dig cellars, and build dugouts, preparing to welcome their wives to spend the winter together. They saved money for the country and also solved their own difficulties. It is these lovely workers who erected well derricks one by one on the vast wilderness, allowing crude oil that has been stored for thousands of years to spew out of the formation to the surface. Dysentery, mosquitoes, water shortage, and scorching heat have not stopped them. They are welcoming the winter with unparalleled heroism. Winter, no matter how cold, will surely be subdued by them.

    迎接冬天
    本报记者　沈石
    9月下旬，克拉玛依油区刮了一场暴风，撑在戈壁上的五十多顶帐篷都被吹垮了，木柱撑的帐篷自然不用说，钢架撑的帐篷，连钢梁也折弯了。新落成的房屋，迎风的一面，玻璃都碎了，用铁皮盖的屋顶，有的也被卷走了。
    暴风，向克拉玛依矿务局的人发出了警告：戈壁上的严冬是没有情面的。
    暴风，提高了人们的警惕，原来决定距离较远的工程段用棉帐篷过冬的，改用地窝子来代替了。原来计划四十公里长的水管线，等全线竣工后再放水的，改变为分段放水了。矿务局的负责人分头下到各工程段，检查防寒保温的准备工作。新疆石油管理局局长张文彬，也到了和布克赛尔蒙古族自治县，和自治县人民委员会的负责人商量煤炭的运输问题。暴风，催促人们准备过冬的步伐，从前用快步的，现在用跑步了。
    一个晚上，克拉玛依矿务局一间狭窄的地窝子里，坐满了人。电灯发出微弱的淡黄色的光辉，飞蛾不停地向灯光扑去，地窝子里烟雾缭绕，充满了难闻的纸烟气息。在座的人中，有矿务局的负责人，有新来的党委书记，有身材瘦削的矿务局的总工程师。矿务局局长只景耀同志低沉地慢吞吞地说：“现在离下雪只有两个月了，我们要在这短促的时间内，做好过冬的准备工作……。”
    迎接冬天，这付担子是不轻的。这时候，探区扩大了，远的工程段，相距百余公里，近的也有三、四十公里，几十口探井像星棋一样，罗列在三千平方公里的面积上。油区已经有上万的人了，工程和生活用水需要量大了，每月供应的水，不是几十吨、几百吨，而是万余吨了。油区发展得这么快、这么猛，带来的问题，真是千头万绪。
    油区的面貌固然在迅速地改变，可是，它的地理、交通条件，却和它的开发很不适应。克拉玛依位于准噶尔盆地的西北边缘，远离城市。这里，只是一片戈壁和长满耐旱植物的荒原，新发现的油田，平地起家，哪怕是一枝牙刷，一块木板，都得从远道运来。连饮用的水，水源也在四十公里以外，无怪乎这儿的人都认为水是最可贵的了。
    这时候，从独山子到克拉玛依的公路还没有畅通，从玉门调来的载重十吨的柴油汽车，本来每小时可行驶九十公里的，到这儿，真是英雄无用武之地了，在这样的路上，这种车行驶几趟，不是钢板断了，便是引擎发生了毛病，而修理的工人还不会修理这种车哩！这时候，从玛纳斯河边到克拉玛依长达四十公里的水管线，刚刚测量完毕，引水口还找不着人来设计。这时候，计划修建的一百多栋房屋，只盖好了二十多栋，许多人还睡在帐篷里。这时候，从东北订制的锅炉还没有着落，从国外订购的锅炉还没有运到，而探井上正等着安装这批锅炉哩！只景耀同志在会上说：“在这紧迫关头，我们要保持冷静的头脑。”的确，像房屋、菜窖、煤炭、粮食、井上的保温、人的御寒装备……，大大小小的问题，错综复杂，需要矿务局的领导人保持冷静的头脑，来周密地细致地考虑各种问题。这些工作当中，只要有一项疏忽了，只要有一桩脱节了，就可能影响到冬季生产，就可能影响到人的安全。他，矿务局的领导人，对每一个工人都负有责任。
    钻探处处长马骥祥提醒在座的人，红山嘴工程段的工人已经有受冻生病的，他为迟迟没有运到的锅炉感到焦虑。马骥祥同志在去年就到过克拉玛依，开钻第一、二号井时，他和工人在这儿度过了第一个冬天，这儿严冬的滋味他是体会得较深的。寒流过境的时候，刺骨的旋风，卷起雪花，漫天飞舞。大地被积雪盖住了，穿着毡靴踩下去，雪掩没了膝盖。第二号井正在钻进时，发生了井喷。从探井里喷出来的水，落到钻台上，钻台凝成一座冰丘。喷到井架上，井架变成了冰塔。工人从井架底层凿穿坚冰，钻进去抢救，棉衣溅湿了，立刻结成了冰。艰苦的冬季野外生活，他长远也不会忘怀。现在，钻探处的工人增加了，不像第一个冬天那样，只有一、二个钻井队在野外操作了。这些新添的工人当中，许多人还没有经历过这儿的严冬，想到他们，他的责任感自然加重了。
    红山嘴工程段的工人受冻生病的讯息，使中共克拉玛依矿务局委员会第一书记张芝林听了，感到难受。他向在座的人说：“我们要关心人，关心每一个人，我们要做到在冬天不冻坏一个人。”张芝林同志来克拉玛依虽然还只有几天，他对钻井和试油虽然还是门外汉，他却访问了好几处工地，接触了许多工人，当他在为少数民族工人开办的饭堂里，看到维吾尔、哈萨克工人吃饭时，喝不上茶，吃不上肉，他感叹地说：“我们的同志，还不会做人的工作，还往往忽视少数民族的生活习惯。”他平时和同志们交谈，发觉有的人对准备过冬信心不足。他在这次会上说：“要度过冬天，的确困难重重。但是，在困难面前，我们不能失去信心。只要依靠工人，发动大家，多想办法，困难是可以克服的。”的确，在困难面前，有的同志往往束手无策，有的坐守办公室，张着眼睛，老是等待，等待物资和器材，等待再增加人。他们好像没有看见眼前的工人，没有发现他们的智慧和力量。新疆石油管理局副局长秦峰同志在会上批判了这种思想。他举出一些事情可以发动工人来做。像道路不好，运输力不足，车辆耗损很大，可以发动司机，让他们想办法来发掘运输潜力；像探井的保温，在木料不足的情况下，并不一定要在井架底层的周围安装上木板，可以用芦苇来代替，而艾力克湖和玛纳斯河两岸，有的是芦苇。他说：“等待是过不了冬的，时间不会等待我们，也不容许我们等待。”
    会议给克拉玛依油区带来了新的活力，以前人们在慢吞吞地迎接冬天，现在开始用快的步伐了。钻井队、试油队、井架安装队、运输站、泥浆化验室……开始检查过冬的准备工作。已经做了什么，还短少些什么，哪些可以自己解决，哪些不能就地解决，好让各部门的负责人心中有数。工人们利用工余时间，分批地出发到玛纳斯河边和艾力克湖畔去割芦苇，人们都动起来了。
    从独山子到克拉玛依公路的工地上，工人和战士在修筑最后几公里线路，脸色苍老、戴着黑框眼镜的翁礼柔工程师，终日来往工地上，指挥筑路。那些从南京、西安和重庆公路工程学校来的毕业生，和工人生活在一起。他们离开了大城市，整个夏天，住在戈壁上，睡帐篷，喝混浊的水。他们看到汽车在那尽是坑坑洼洼的路上行驶，像一根刺扎在心上。9月上旬，这段公路畅通了，他们又带着胜利的心情转移到了新的工地。
    从玛纳斯河边到克拉玛依，司机们运来了直径八寸的无缝钢管，玉门来的管线安装工人，把钢管一节一节地焊接起来。焊接好了的钢管，像一根黑色的巨蟒一样躺在准噶尔盆地的荒原上。买买提·尼亚孜和他的徒弟杨国有轮流地驾驶着二十吨重的挖沟机，在满是鹅卵石和块石的戈壁上，顺着钢管铺设的方向，挖开了一道深两公尺的沟槽，水管焊接完毕，涂上沥青，将长埋在沟内。
    离成吉斯汗山麓不到一公里的戈壁上，新盖的房屋，从远处望去，恰像一座小的市镇。粉红色、黄色、白色的墙壁，是利用当地出产的有色的泥土来粉刷的。夜里，每个窗口都射出明亮的电灯光辉。绝大部分工人都已经移进新居了。较远的工程段，也在为工人赶修过冬的地窝子。谁会料到仅仅在半年内，经过生产建设部队男女战士辛勤的双手，把沉睡了千万年的荒凉的戈壁点缀得这样的不同了呢！
    正在钻进的每口探井，新运来的锅炉已经安装好了。工人们把割好的芦苇编成芦席，围在井架底层的周围，用木板钉牢，里里外外，再涂上一层胶泥。钻台后面，泥浆池和柴油机装置的地方，用木柱和芦苇搭成了小房。这样，到了冬天，工人在钻台上操作，可以少受寒风的侵袭，泥浆池也不会冻结了。
    10月中旬，张芝林同志到玛纳斯河边的探井上检查防寒保温工作。他看到工人们已经穿上了乌鲁木齐市缝纫工人赶制的棉衣。在他们宿舍里，他看到床下放着从塔城、伊宁运来的毡靴。伙房里，堆着从玛纳斯河流域各农场供给的菜蔬。他对工人们说：“多少人在关心我们，在支援我们，我们不能辜负他们的情意啊！”
    就在玛纳斯河边，有的工人利用工余时间，割回芦苇，伐回野生的沙枣树，挖好地窖，盖成了地窝子，准备迎接妻子来共同度过冬天。他们为国家节省了金钱，也解决了自己的困难。就是这些可爱的工人，在辽阔无边的荒原上，竖起了一座一座的井架，让蕴藏了千万年的原油从地层中喷出地面来。痢疾、蚊虻、水荒、酷暑，没有难住他们，他们正以无比的英雄气概来迎接冬天。冬天尽管奇寒，一定会被他们慑服的。
