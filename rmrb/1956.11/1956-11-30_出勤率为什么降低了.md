Why is the Attendance Rate Decreasing?
	Lu Chaoqi
	Not long ago, I visited Tianjin and Qingdao. These two cities have a relatively large number of textile factories, so I focused on understanding the situation of the textile factories. Comrades from the State-Owned Industry Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China told me that the attendance rate of textile enterprises this year (excluding those on official leave, which are not counted as absences) is lower than last year, and accidents and sick leave are also more frequent than last year. The average attendance rate of the No. 2 State-Owned Cotton Factory in the first quarter was 92.67%, which was 2.48% lower than the same period last year; the number of work stoppage days was more than 31,000, which was 56% more than the same period last year.
	The statistics for the second quarter are not available, but it is said to be similar to the first quarter.
	In Qingdao, responsible comrades from the State-Owned Industry Department of the Municipal Committee and the Textile Administration Bureau Office also said that the attendance rate of production workers in various textile factories this year is generally about 2% lower than the same period last year, and some factories are as much as 4% to 5% lower. Moreover, according to a joint investigation by the State-Owned Industry Department of the Municipal Committee and other units on the No. 2 and No. 4 State-Owned Cotton Factories, the attendance rate is declining month by month.
	Why has the attendance rate of textile enterprises in these two places decreased? According to my understanding, there are the following reasons:
		Too Many After-Work Activities
	Too many after-work activities are a problem that workers find most distressing. In various textile factories in Tianjin and Qingdao, after a great deal of streamlining of meetings, there is still one production meeting per week, one Party or Communist Youth League activity meeting or trade union activity meeting, one "political activity" meeting, and three sessions at spare-time schools. In fact, many factories have more than three meetings per week. For example, the Qingdao No. 2 State-Owned Cotton Factory held as many as twenty-five "political activity" meetings from January to April this year (according to regulations, there should only be sixteen). According to the content: four times each for propaganda on military service and public bonds, three times for propaganda on the victory of socialist transformation, three times for mobilizing the advanced producer movement, once for relaying the Qingdao Municipal Advanced Producer Representative Conference, and once each for mobilizing to eliminate illiteracy, Spring Festival attendance, worker-peasant alliance, visits to the countryside, relaying the central government's instructions on completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, relaying the overall plan of the factory, public security policy, discussing collective contracts, and labor discipline. After working eight hours a day, workers who go home to eat do not even have time to eat their meals, and then they continue to attend meetings or study culture. Each meeting and cultural study session lasts two hours at most and one and a half hours at least. According to a survey by the Tianjin No. 2 State-Owned Cotton Factory, early-shift workers generally get up at five o'clock in the morning (three o'clock for those who live particularly far away) and do not return home until 8:30 or 9:00 in the evening, that is, they are continuously active for about sixteen hours. There are especially many female workers in textile factories. When they return home, they have to cook, feed their children, wash clothes, or review their lessons. Therefore, they actually do not have eight hours of rest. If they also serve as group leaders or members of the Party, Communist Youth League, trade union, or administration, then they are often dragged to meetings on Sundays as well. This happens every day, month after month, so many workers feel physically exhausted and neurasthenic, which affects their attendance rate.
		Unreasonable Work Quotas
	The Qingdao Textile Trade Union and other units sent people to conduct on-site inspections at the No. 3 State-Owned Cotton Factory and found that the labor intensity is very high for workers who implement operating procedures within the specified quota hours. For example, a worker in the carding workshop who looks after twenty-four machines (spinning 12-count yarn) walks 11.6 li (approximately 5.8 kilometers) during each shift (eight hours), and he has to move 17.3 meters of 7,000 pounds of cotton sliver cans and other items within the specified one and a half hours, which means he has to move an average of 77 pounds per minute. From this, it can be seen that the labor load per minute is quite heavy. Since the elimination of the doffing team in a workshop in 1952, the doffing has been done by the machine operators helping each other, resulting in the machine operators walking more than five li (approximately 2.5 kilometers) more every eight hours and doing all the work of the doffing workers.
	The same is true for the spinning workshop. In June of this year, this workshop changed the original sixteen people in two doffing teams in each work area to ten people in one doffing team. The number of people was reduced and the working hours were compressed, but the work required by the operating procedures was increased. Previously, there were twenty-five minutes of cleaning time after each doffing, and each person cleaned one and a half machines and dug the machine board twice; now there are only ten minutes each time, and each person cleans three machines and digs the machine board three times. Because the specified cleaning time is not enough, many workers use their lunch break (half an hour) to do cleaning work.
		Some Advanced Experiences Have Increased Labor Intensity
	In Tianjin and Qingdao, I have heard people say that the advanced experiences summarized and promoted by the Ministry of Textile Industry, the National Committee of the Textile Trade Union, and various administrations and factories generally help to ensure product output and improve product quality. However, some of these experiences make workers walk more, while others increase operating time. For example, in order to improve the quality of yarn, the blowing room does not research and use broken cotton and mixed cotton equipment, but requires the cotton opening workers to tear the whole package of cotton into pieces by hand, so that the workers have one action every half second. Another example is the spinning workshop of the Qingdao No. 3 State-Owned Cotton Factory, which promoted an "advanced" experience of watching the platform in order to distinguish the responsibility for the peeling roller flowers and the blank yarn. With the promotion of this experience, each worker walks 6.77 li (approximately 3.4 kilometers) more every eight hours. From the perspective of each specific experience, it seems that increasing the labor intensity a little is nothing, but many experiences increase a little, and when concentrated on the workers, the workers cannot bear it. Workers, especially older workers, have opinions on this type of advanced experience. Some people implement the "new experience" when the cadres come, and use the old experience when the cadres leave; some people implement the "new experience" during the day and still use the old experience at night; some people would rather wear the hat of "dead backward" than promote it.
	Of course, there are other reasons affecting the low attendance rate, such as the fact that there are many female workers in textile factories, resulting in more people taking maternity leave; some workers being temporarily transferred to do other work; and some workers attending various meetings outside the factory. However, the main reason is that some arrangements in the work are not reasonable enough, which increases the burden on the workers and affects their health, resulting in a decrease in the attendance rate. Therefore, the relevant units should earnestly solve these problems to ensure that the workers are full of energy and make more achievements in the production increase and economy practice movement.

    出勤率为什么降低了
    陆超祺
    不久以前，我先后到天津、青岛采访。这两个城市的纺织厂比较多，我也就着重了解纺织厂的情况。中共天津市委国营工业部的同志告诉我，今年纺织企业的出勤率（请公假的不算在缺勤内）比去年的低，事故和病假也比去年多。国棉二厂第一季度的平均出勤率为92.67％，比去年同期低2.48％；歇工日数三万一千多个，比去年同期多56％。
    第二季度的没有统计，据说跟第一季的差不多。
    在青岛，市委国营工业部和纺织管理局办公室的负责同志，也说各纺织厂今年生产工人的出勤率，一般都比去年同期的低2％左右，个别的厂要低4％到5％。而且据市委国营工业部等单位共同对国棉二、四厂的调查，出勤率还是逐月下降的。
    这两个地方的纺织企业的出勤率为什么降低了？据我了解有以下几个原因：
        业余活动太多
    业余活动太多，是工人最感苦恼的一个问题。在天津、青岛各纺织厂里，经过大力精简会议以后，每周仍有一次生产会议，一次党团会议或工会活动会议，一次“政治活动”会议，三次上业余学校。事实上，许多工厂每周的会议都超过三次。例如青岛国棉二厂，今年1至4月，召开的“政治活动”会议就有二十五次（按规定只有十六次）之多。按照内容来分：宣传兵役、公债各四次，宣传社会主义改造胜利三次，动员开展先进生产者运动三次，传达青岛市先进生产者代表大会一次，动员扫除文盲、春节出勤、工农联盟、访问农村、传达中央关于提前完成五年计划的指示、传达全厂规划、公安政策、讨论集体合同、劳动纪律等各一次。工人每天工作八小时以后，回家吃饭的人连饭也顾不得吃，就接着开会或者学文化。每次会议和学文化，多的二小时，少的一小时半。据天津国棉二厂调查，早班工人一般都是早上五点钟（路特别远的三点）就起床，晚上八点半或九点才回家，即连续活动十六小时左右。纺织厂里女工特别多。她们回到家里，又要做饭吃，又要喂孩子，洗衣服，或者温习功课。所以，实际上并没有八小时的休息。如果兼任党、团、工会、行政的小组长、委员，那末，星期日也常常被抓来开会。天天如此，月月如此，所以不少工人们感到身体疲乏，神经衰弱，因而影响到出勤率。
        工时定额不合理
    青岛纺织工会等单位派人在国棉三厂现场视察发现，工人在规定的定额工时内贯彻操作规程，其劳动强度是很高的。如梳棉车间一个看二十四台车的值车工人（纺十二支纱），每一个轮班（八小时）巡回所走的路有十一点六里，他要在规定的一小时半内把七千磅棉条筒等物移动十七点三公尺，即平均每分钟要搬七十七磅。由此可见每分钟的劳动荷负是相当重的。有一个车间自从1952年取消落纱小组以后，由值车工互助落纱，结果使值车工每八小时多走五里多路，还要做落纱工人的全部工作。
    细纱车间也一样。这个车间今年6月把原来每个工区两个落纱组十六个人，改为一个落纱组十个人。人少了，工时也压缩了，但操作规程要求做的工作却增加了。以前每落完一次纱有二十五分钟的清洁工作时间，每人只清洁一台半车，挖两次车板；现在每次只有十分钟，每人清洁三台车，挖三次车板。因为规定的清洁工作时间不够，许多工人都利用午饭后的休息时间（半小时）做清洁工作。
      有些先进经验增加了劳动强度
    在天津和青岛，都听到有人说，纺织工业部、纺织工会全国委员会，以及各管理局、各厂所总结和推广的先进经验，一般说来，都有助于保证产品产量和提高产品质量。不过其中有些经验使工人多跑了路，有些则增加了操作时间。例如为了提高纱的质量，清花车间不研究和使用碎棉和混棉设备，却要求和花工人用手把整包棉花撕成一片一片的，使工人每秒半钟就有一个动作。又如青岛国棉三厂细纱车间为了分清出皮辊花和坯纱的责任，就推广了一种“先进”的看台经验。推广了这种经验，每个工人每八小时就多走六点七七里路。从每一个具体的经验看来，好像增加一点劳动强度算不了什么，但是许多经验都增加一点，集中到工人身上，工人就有点吃不消。工人们，特别是年纪比较大的工人对于这一类的先进经验，都有意见。有的人是干部来了执行“新经验”，干部走了就用老经验；有的人是白天执行“新经验”，晚上还是用老经验；有的人宁可顶着“死落后”的帽子也不愿意推广。
    当然影响到出勤率低还有其它的一些原因，如纺织厂女工多，因而请产假的人多；有些工人被临时调走作其他工作；有些工人出席厂外的各种会议。但是主要原因还是工作中有些安排不够合理，增加了工人的负担，影响了工人健康，使得出勤率降低了，因此各有关单位应当切实解决这些问题，保证工人们精神饱满地在增产节约运动中作出更多的成绩。
