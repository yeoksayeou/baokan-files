Xinhua News Agency, 15th - The National Congress of Activists of Revolutionary Martyrs’ Dependents, Military Dependents, Disabled Veterans, and Demobilized Soldiers in Socialist Construction continued its sessions on the 15th.

    Zhang Ze, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, also spoke at the meeting this morning. He said that revolutionary martyrs’ dependents, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers have already made contributions to the motherland, and these glorious contributions will always be remembered in the hearts of the people. Young people living in happiness should thank you; you are the most worthy of respect and should be respected by young people. Zhang Ze said: "Our Communist Youth League organizations should do more work in the area of preferential treatment. In addition to assisting the government in doing a good job in preferential treatment and demobilization resettlement, we must also carry out publicity and education among young people, establish a social atmosphere of respecting revolutionary martyrs’ dependents, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers, further develop the good revolutionary tradition of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, and struggle against those phenomena that discriminate against and exclude revolutionary martyrs’ dependents, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers." Zhang Ze finally expressed the hope that the activists present would continue to carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory.

    Group discussions were held this afternoon. The activists enthusiastically discussed the letter to be adopted at the conference to revolutionary martyrs’ dependents, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers nationwide, as well as the telegrams of salute to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army.

    On the morning of the 14th, the activists listened to a report on agricultural cooperation by Chen Zhengren, Deputy Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
