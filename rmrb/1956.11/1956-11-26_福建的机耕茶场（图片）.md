    Fujian's Mechanized Tea Farm
    Chongan Mechanized Tea Farm is the largest tea farm in Fujian Province. The Wuyi rock tea produced here is famous at home and abroad. In recent years, after using tractors for cultivation, the tea garden area has expanded from several hundred mu in the past to more than 3,000 mu. This is a scene of deep plowing in a young tea garden with a tractor. These newly expanded tea gardens will gradually start producing tea from next year. Photo by Wang Donglin

    福建的机耕茶场
    崇安机耕茶场是福建省最大的茶场，这里盛产的武夷岩茶，驰名国内外。这几年来用拖拉机耕作后，茶园面积由过去的几百亩扩大到三千多亩。这是正在用拖拉机在幼龄茶园中进行深耕的情景。这些新扩种的茶园从明年起将要陆续开始生产茶叶。　王东麟摄
