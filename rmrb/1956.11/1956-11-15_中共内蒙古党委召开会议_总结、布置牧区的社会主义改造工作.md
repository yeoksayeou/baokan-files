Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, November 13th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held its Fourth Pastoral Area Work Conference from October 29th to November 9th. The meeting reviewed, summarized, and deployed the socialist transformation work in the autonomous region's pastoral areas.

The meeting pointed out that under the leadership of the Party, the socialist transformation of animal husbandry in the autonomous region has developed. The number of pastoral production cooperatives has increased from 258 in March of this year to 543, with more than 18,500 herder households participating, accounting for 21.91% of the total number of herder households. Adding the herder households participating in various types of mutual aid teams, they account for 83% of the total number of herder households in the pastoral areas.

Herdsmen participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations have further improved the feeding and management of livestock, and have improved their techniques in breeding improved livestock varieties and treating livestock diseases. The vast majority of cooperatives developed production and increased the income of their members.

With the development of mutual aid and cooperative organisations, the herdsmen who have been nomadic on the grasslands for many years have begun to practice settled nomadism. This year, the 1.07 million mu of fodder bases opened up on the grasslands have also mostly achieved bumper harvests.

In the cooperative movement, many regions have trained cadres, developed Party and League members, strengthened political and ideological work within the cooperatives, and brought into play the leading role of the Party.

The meeting reviewed the shortcomings and errors in the construction of cooperatives in some areas, such as forced orders, violation of the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, insufficient attention to the personal interests of cooperative members, and neglect of unity with mutual aid groups and herdsmen of all ethnic groups, and demanded that Party committees at all levels quickly correct them.

After full discussion, the meeting believed that in the future, in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in pastoral areas, it is necessary to further resolutely implement the general policy of "relying on working herdsmen, uniting all forces that can be united, and gradually realizing the socialist transformation of animal husbandry on the basis of steadily developing animal husbandry production." In order to realize this general policy, the meeting believed that it is necessary to strengthen the ideological and organizational construction of the Party in pastoral areas.

The meeting pointed out: Currently, mutual aid and cooperative organizations in pastoral areas need to fully allocate income, ensure that the vast majority of cooperative members increase their income, and strive to increase the income of all cooperative members, rectify and consolidate existing cooperatives, and fully prepare for production in pastoral areas. During the winter season, cooperatives should not be established, expanded, merged, or transformed into advanced cooperatives.

Liu Chun, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, participated in the meeting and gave instructions at the meeting.

    中共内蒙古党委召开会议
    总结、布置牧区的社会主义改造工作
    新华社呼和浩特13日电　中共内蒙古自治区委员会从10月29日到11月9日召开了第四次牧区工作会议。会议检查、总结和布置了自治区牧区的社会主义改造工作。
    会议指出，在党的领导下自治区畜牧业社会主义改造工作有了发展。牧业生产合作社自今年3月的二百五十八个发展到五百四十三个，入社牧民已达一万八千五百多户，占总牧户的21.91％，加上参加各类互助组的牧户，已占牧区总牧户的83％。
    参加互助合作组织的牧民，已经进一步改善了对牲畜的饲养管理，提高了改良牲畜品种和治疗牲畜疾病等技术。绝大部分的社都发展了生产，增加了社员收入。
    随着互助合作组织的发展，多少年来游牧在草原上的牧民们，开始实行了定居游牧。今年，在草原上开辟的一百零七万亩饲料基地，也大部获得了丰收。
    在合作化运动中，许多地区都培养训练干部，发展了党团员，加强在社内的政治思想工作，发挥了党的领导作用。
    会议对目前有些地区在建社工作中强迫命令，违反自愿互利原则，照顾社员个人利益不够，以及忽视团结互助组和各族牧民等缺点和错误，都作了检查，并要求各级党委迅速纠正。
    会议经过充分讨论后，认为今后在牧区互助合作运动中必须进一步坚决贯彻“依靠劳动牧民，团结一切可能团结的力量，在稳步发展畜牧业生产的基础上，逐步地实现对畜牧业的社会主义改造”的总方针。为了实现这个总方针，会议认为必须加强党在牧区的思想建设与组织建设工作。
    会议指出：当前牧区互助合作组织需全力作好收益分配，保证绝大多数社员并且尽力争取所有社员增加收入，整顿巩固现有社，全面作好牧区生产。入冬季节合作社暂时一律不建、不扩、不并和不转高级社。
    民族事务委员会副主任刘春参加了这次会议，并在会上作了指示。
