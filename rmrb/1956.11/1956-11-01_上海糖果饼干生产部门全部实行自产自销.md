Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Shanghai's candies and biscuits are now all produced and sold by the production departments themselves.

In the past, Shanghai-produced candies and biscuits were exclusively purchased and sold by the China Department Store Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station. Now, the industrial departments have established their own management departments, opened sample showrooms to facilitate customer viewing and selection, and conduct direct transactions. To date, more than 500 grassroots stores and supply and marketing cooperatives from other regions have established supply and sales relationships with the management departments. Previously, they could only purchase Shanghai products from state-owned company wholesale departments within their provinces, and sometimes the goods were not suitable for local consumer preferences. The Shanghai Guangming Food Production Cooperative, a large-scale biscuit producer, has added salesmen and delivery trucks, implementing telephone purchases and door-to-door delivery. Currently, 70% of the candy, biscuit, and tea snack stores in the city sell products from this cooperative. Stores can simply make a phone call, whether for ten or five pounds, and the cooperative will quickly deliver the goods. Consumers can buy freshly baked biscuits from the cooperative in the stores. In the past, when the state-owned company purchasing and supply station handled exclusive sales, biscuits typically went through four stages from the cooperative to the consumer, taking about a week.

After implementing self-production and self-sales, factories and production cooperatives are paying more attention to improving product quality and variety. All sixty-six state-owned and jointly owned state-private candy and biscuit factories in the city have begun to establish product inspection organizations and systems. Industrial companies are also developing standards for the shelf life of each type of candy and biscuit, preparing to implement a product return and exchange policy. The Shanghai Yimin Food Factory No. 3, a local state-owned enterprise, produced a type of round fruit candy that was large and expensive per piece, making it unsuitable for sale by the piece in rural areas. It has now switched to producing small-sized fruit candies to supply the market. After two candy production cooperatives implemented self-sales, they restored their original purchasing and sales relationships with small vendors in urban and suburban areas, and added more than twenty new varieties based on customer feedback. In front of the cooperative's newly opened retail stores, customers are constantly coming and going, and the products are very popular. The two cooperatives' current sales volume has increased by two times compared to before self-sales in May.

### 上海糖果饼干生产部门全部实行自产自销

    上海糖果饼干生产部门全部实行自产自销
    据新华社讯　上海的糖果、饼干已经全部由生产部门自产自销。
    上海生产的糖果、饼干，过去是由中国百货公司上海采购供应站统购包销的。现在，工业部门已经自己成立经理部，开辟样品陈列室，便利顾客看样选购，直接成交。到目前为止，已经有五百多个外地的基层商店和供销合作社等单位同经理部建立了供销关系。过去他们只能向省内的国营公司批发部门购买上海产品，有时商品就不适合当地消费者的爱好。规模很大的、生产饼干的上海光明食品生产合作社，新添了推销员和送货车，实行电话购买，送货上门。现在全市70％的糖果饼干店和茶食店都有这个合作社的产品出售。商店打一个电话，不论十斤五斤，合作社便很快地把货送去。消费者可以在店里买到生产合作社刚出炉的饼干。而过去由国营公司采购供应站包销的时候，饼干从合作社到消费者手中，一般要经过四道环节，时间要相隔一个星期左右。
    实行自产自销以后，工厂和生产合作社更加关心产品质量和花色的改进。全市六十六家国营和公私合营的糖果、饼干工厂已着手建立产品检验的机构和制度，工业公司也正在制订每种糖果、饼干保藏期的标准，准备实行产品保退保换办法。地方国营上海益民食品三厂生产的一种圆形水果糖，颗粒大，每颗价格贵，不适宜在农村论颗出售。现在已改产小颗粒的水果糖供应市场。两个糖果生产合作社实行自销后，同市区和郊区的小商贩等恢复了原有的购销关系，并且根据顾客们的意见增加了二十多种新品种。在合作社新开的门市部面前，顾客络绎不绝，产品很受欢迎。两个社目前销售量比5月份自销前增加了两倍。
