    From Worry to Joy

    Zhang Gaozhi, a member of the Yongxing No. 1 Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Kaijiang County, Sichuan, was constantly calculating when the primary cooperative transitioned to an advanced cooperative last autumn: his family of seven had four underage children, and his wife was often sick and had never worked in the fields. Only he and his eldest daughter could participate in labor. After joining the primary cooperative in 1955, the annual income was 279.30 yuan, which was more than before joining the cooperative. After transitioning to the advanced cooperative, land remuneration was cancelled. Could their original income be guaranteed? He wasn't sure. Therefore, he hesitated to transfer to the advanced cooperative. Later, he reluctantly joined the advanced cooperative with everyone else.

    After the transition, the cooperative appropriately assigned some light work, such as indoor seed selection for both the spring and summer crops, to his wife based on his family's specific labor situation. They also trained his daughter to be a cotton planting technician. As for Zhang Gaozhi himself, the cooperative not only had him do fieldwork but also allowed him to do some noodle processing and other odd jobs. At the same time, his family also raised a pig and some chickens and ducks. In this way, his whole family was able to participate in appropriate labor. This year, they can earn more than 290 yuan. If you add the income from household sideline production, the annual net income will be nearly 340 yuan, which is almost 60 yuan more than last year.

    Zhang Gaozhi, who was full of worries before the transition to the advanced cooperative, now excitedly says, "The advanced cooperative is really good!"

    从顾虑重重到喜笑颜开
    四川开江县永兴第一高级农业社社员张高志，在去年秋天由初级社转高级社的时候，老是盘算着：全家七口人，就有四个未成年的小孩，妻子还是个常常生病从未下田干过活的人，只有自己和大女儿能参加劳动。1955年加入初级社以后，全年收入人民币二百七十九元三角，比起入社以前，收入是增多了。转高级社以后，取消了土地报酬，能不能保证原来的收入呢？还不敢肯定。因此，他对转社犹豫不决。以后，还是勉强随大伙转入了高级社。
    转社以后，社里根据他家的劳动力的具体情况，把大、小春的室内选种等轻活适当地分一些给他妻子来做，又培养他女儿做植棉技术员。至于张高志本人，社里除让他作田间活外，还让他搞一些挂面加工等活路。同时，他家还增养了一头猪和一些鸡鸭。这样，就使他全家都能参加适当的劳动。今年，他们能收入二百九十多元。如果再加上家庭副业收入，全年纯收入将近三百四十元，比去年能多收入近六十元。
    转社前顾虑重重的张高志，现在兴奋地说：“高级社硬是好！”
