Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Western news agencies reported on November 2nd that Britain and France are stepping up their final deployment activities to dispatch invading troops to land in Egypt.

	The huge British and French fleet has gathered at both ends of the Suez Canal. Britain and France continue to transport troops eastward to Cyprus. The British and French Joint Headquarters on this island has announced the list of commanders of the British and French joint task force, including the British and French commanders and deputy commanders of the ground forces, naval forces, and air forces. The British and French headquarters also announced that the activities of the British and French air forces against Egypt "have shifted from completely attacking airport targets to attacking large military transfer operations in the Nile Delta."

	The British official radio station on the island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean roared on the 2nd: "Our warships will unload tanks and artillery on Egyptian territory."

	The British Admiralty told international shipping vessels on the same day not to stay in the Mediterranean along the coasts of Cyprus and Egypt, as well as the southern passage of the Red Sea to the Suez Canal area.

	Meanwhile, the French Ministry of Defense issued a communique in Paris on the 2nd, announcing that the work of the British and French bombing of Egyptian airports and sweeping the sea on both ends of the Suez Canal "has now virtually ended." Therefore, the "goal" of naval and air force activities "will now be to achieve the conditions necessary for the temporary occupation of the canal zone."

	A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said on the same day that despite the United Nations General Assembly passing a resolution with an overwhelming majority calling for a ceasefire by Britain and France, France and Britain will continue to implement their plan to attack the Suez Canal according to the planned schedule.

    英法加紧准备登陆
    新华社3日讯　西方通讯社11月2日的消息表明，英法正加紧进行派遣侵略军在埃及登陆的最后部署活动。
    庞大的英法舰队已经聚集在苏伊士运河的两端。英法继续把军队源源东运到塞浦路斯。设在这个岛上的英法联军总部已经宣布了英法联合特遣部队的司令官名单，其中包括地面部队、海军部队和空军部队的英法正副司令。英法总部同时还宣布，英法空军对埃及的活动“已经从完全袭击机场目标转向袭击尼罗河三角洲的大军事转运营”。
    地中海中的塞浦路斯岛上的英国官方电台在2日咆哮说：“我们的兵舰将把坦克和大炮卸在埃及的领土上。”
    英国海军部在同一天告诉国际航行船只不要停留在塞浦路斯和埃及沿海的地中海以及红海南部通道到苏伊士运河的地区。
    同时，法国国防部2日在巴黎发表的公报宣布，英法轰炸埃及飞机场和扫荡苏伊士运河两端的海面的工作“现在实际上已经结束”。因此，海空军活动的“目标现在将是去实现为暂时占领运河区所必不可少的条件”。
    法国外交部发言人在同一天说，尽管联合国大会以绝大多数通过了要英法停火的决议，法国和英国仍将按照预定计划执行它们进攻苏伊士运河的计划。
