During their visit to China, they learned about the actual situation of tea tree cultivation and tea production in China, and worked with Chinese tea experts to study methods for making tea fragrant, using coarse tea leaves to make tea, and the technology for manufacturing green tea bricks.

    喜讯答喜讯
    苏联奇姆肯特的自动压力机工厂的全体职工，不久前收到了从中国一个正在建设的工厂寄去的一封信。信上说，这个工厂完全有可能提前开工。苏联友人得到了这个喜讯，便热情地展开了讨论。现在，他们已经决定用喜讯回答喜讯，要提前两个月发出中国朋友所订购的全部机器。最优秀的工人被派去制造这些机器，他们都是至少超额一倍完成生产定额的工人。
    红茶种友情
