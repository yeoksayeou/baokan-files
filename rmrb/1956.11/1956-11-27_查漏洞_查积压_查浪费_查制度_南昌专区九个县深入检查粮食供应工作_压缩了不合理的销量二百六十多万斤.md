Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 26th. In the comprehensive grain supply inspection work, nine counties in Nanchang Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, have adopted the method of "Four Investigations" (investigating loopholes, investigating backlogs, investigating waste, and investigating systems) to reduce unreasonable sales by more than 2.6 million jin, and also recovered more than 23,550 jin of surplus grain coupons.

Some time ago, the grain departments of these nine counties believed that agricultural cooperatives had been established and grain production had increased, so they did not strictly control grain sales, resulting in supply arrangements exceeding actual needs. In response to the above situation, the counties successively mobilized the masses to self-report and mutually evaluate, and adopted the "Four Investigations" method to inspect grain supply work according to different situations. Before the inspection by the Wanzai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the average monthly grain supply per person reached 34.1 jin. After the inspection, the actual grain consumption averaged only 29.05 jin, with a monthly surplus of 558 jin. After inspection by the tax bureau, thirty-four people had a monthly surplus of 215 jin of grain. An inspection of 117 households in Tanbu Town in this county resulted in just three households returning 2,284 jin of surplus supply grain. Through the "Four Investigations", Fengcheng County discovered that as much as 1.12 million jin of grain had been supplied with old certificates (which had been invalidated).

Many industries and catering units did not strictly comply with the supply system for grain consumption. In Shangfu Town, Fengxin County, five industries alone had a backlog of 1,035 jin of rice, 3,451 jin of flour, and 1,200 jin of glutinous rice in October. Grain was issued to catering units without counting, as much as was requested. Xinyu County recovered 15,979 jin of grain coupons for grain accumulated but not purchased by catering units in this inspection.

After inspecting and reducing unreasonable grain supplies, these nine counties are further conducting in-depth inspections to ensure that the supply is "determined accurately" and "determined stably", plugging all loopholes, and reducing all unreasonable sales.

    查漏洞　查积压　查浪费　查制度
    南昌专区九个县深入检查粮食供应工作
    压缩了不合理的销量二百六十多万斤
    新华社南昌26日电　江西省南昌专区有九个县在全面检查粮食供应工作中，通过“四查”（查漏洞、查积压、查浪费、查制度）的办法，压缩不合理的销量二百六十多万斤，同时收回了多余粮票二万三千五百五十斤。
    前些时，这九个县的粮食部门认为农业合作化了，粮食增产了，便对粮食销售不加严格控制，因而发生了供应安排超过了实际需要。针对上述情况，各县先后发动了群众自报互评，并根据不同的情况，采取了“四查”办法检查粮食供应工作。万载县供销合作总社检查前，平均每人每月供应粮食达三十四点一斤，检查后实际用粮平均只二十九点零五斤，每月剩余粮食五百五十八斤；税务局经过检查，三十四个人每月就多余粮食二百一十五斤。这个县潭埠镇检查了一百一十七户的结果，其中仅三户就退回了多余供应粮二千二百八十四斤。丰成县通过“四查”，就发现凭旧证（已作废的）供应出去的粮食达一百一十二万斤之多。
    对行业用粮和膳食单位用粮许多没有严格遵守供应制度。奉新县上富镇五个行业，仅10月份就积存大米一千零三十五斤，面粉三千四百五十一斤，糯米一千二百斤。对用膳单位发粮不计数，要多少给多少。新喻县在这次收回用膳单位积存未买粮食的粮票一万五千九百七十九斤。
    这九个县在检查压缩不合理的粮食供应后，还正在进一步作深入的检查，以做到供应“定实”、“定稳”，堵塞一切漏洞，压缩一切不合理的销量。
