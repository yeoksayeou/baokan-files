    Advocate This Approach
  　Wang Pu
    The Party Central Committee has repeatedly emphasized the need to fully leverage the initiative of local areas. Judging from the problem of mechanical industry cooperation in Heilongjiang Province published in yesterday's newspaper, local economic leading organs can do a lot if they take the initiative. Some problems that the central economic leading organs find棘手(jí shǒu, tricky/thorny) can often be readily solved by relying on local forces.
    The production cooperation of the mechanical industry is the most complicated. Various mechanical industry ministries and administrations, stationed in Beijing, manage many factories scattered across various locations. They cannot deeply understand and properly solve all the problems requiring cooperation with other factories for each factory. They are even more unable to understand in detail the equipment capabilities and technical levels of other state-owned factories, local state-owned factories, and joint state-private enterprises that do not belong to their system, making it impossible to judge who to seek cooperation from; nor do they have the power to designate others to cooperate with them. In this way, relying only on the decentralized activities of each factory, searching and stumbling around on their own, it is unknown how much effort will be wasted and how many things will be delayed. Now, the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee and Planning Commission have taken charge of this matter. As a result, each factory learns from others' strengths to offset their weaknesses, and each gets what it needs. The blindness of cooperation between enterprises is reduced, and the completion of the national plan has a reliable guarantee.
    This matter inspires us: it can also be considered whether to broaden the scope of matters managed by various industrial systems in other aspects, and hand over some matters that they cannot manage or manage well to local party and government leading organs. In this way, it may help prevent bureaucracy and solve problems in a timely manner, ensuring production. For example, the adjustment of raw materials and construction materials needed for production, the allocation of construction machinery, transportation power, etc., have been tried out by many local economic leading organs, and they have achieved relatively good results. Other places may as well try this way, and perhaps there are more tasks suitable for this method.
    Of course, implementing such reforms is not simple. Departments will naturally welcome the decentralization of power from various departments if it benefits them; however, since local areas are to balance, there will be inputs and outputs, primary and secondary considerations, and sometimes it will be inevitable to "suffer some losses"; at this time, implementing reforms may be opposed. However, since, overall, doing so is beneficial to our economic work, then we should be determined to do so. If there are shortcomings due to lack of experience, then everyone should study, summarize, and gradually improve; and do not hinder or delay this reform for the sake of certain unilateral considerations.

    提倡这种做法
  　王朴
    党中央再三强调，要充分发挥地方的积极性。从昨日本报发表的黑龙江省解决机械工业的协作问题这件事看来，地方的经济领导机关如果主动起来，是能够做很多事情的。有些在中央经济领导机关感到棘手的问题，依靠地方的力量，往往可以迎刃而解。
    机械工业的生产协作，是最复杂的。各个机械工业部和管理局，驻在北京，管辖着分散在各地的许多个工厂。它们不可能深入了解和妥善地解决每一个工厂所需要别厂协作的全部问题。它们更无法详细了解不属于他们系统的其他国营工厂、地方国营工厂和公私合营工厂的设备能力和技术水平，无从判断可以找谁去协作；更没有权力指定别人来和自己协作。这样，只凭各个工厂分散活动，自己去找去碰，不知道要浪费多少力量，耽误多少事情。现在，黑龙江省人民委员会和计划委员会把这件事管起来了。于是，各个工厂取长补短，各得其所，企业间协作的盲目性减少了，国家计划的完成有了可靠的保证。
    这件事启发我们：还可以考虑是不是在别的方面，也可以把各个产业系统所管的事放宽一些，把一些它们管不了或管不好的事，交给地方党政领导机关去管。这样，也许会有助于防止官僚主义和及时地解决问题，保证生产。比如说，生产所需要的原料和建筑材料的调剂，施工机械、运输力量的调配等等，有不少地方经济领导机关已经试行过，都取得了比较好的效果。别的地方也无妨这样试试看，也许有更多的工作适合采取这种办法呢。
    当然，要实行这样的改革，不是很简单的。把各部门的权力下放，对自己有好处的部门，当然会欢迎；但是，既然要地方来平衡，就会有出有进，有主有次，有时候就难免要“吃些亏”；这时，要实行改革，就可能遭到反对。但是，既然从总的来看，这样做对我们的经济工作有好处，那么，我们就应该下决心这样做。如果因为没有经验，做的有缺点，那么，大家就来研究、总结，逐步改进；而不要为了某些单方面的考虑，阻碍、延缓了这种改革。
