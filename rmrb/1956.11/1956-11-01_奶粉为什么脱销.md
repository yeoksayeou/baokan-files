Why is Milk Powder Out of Stock?
    Zhu Youren

    Recently, a serious shortage of milk powder has occurred in major cities across the country. Many female workers or staff members are worried because they cannot buy milk powder and have crying babies in their arms. In Shenyang alone, the city received more than 150 letters from the people in the third quarter, criticizing commercial departments for not supplying milk powder.
    The fundamental reason for the milk powder shortage is the subjective thinking of the commercial departments. They believe that "milk powder is a slow-moving and unsalable commodity, the sales volume is very small, and the supply can be obtained at any time, so there is no problem in not stocking up." Their business perspective is limited to the circle of overstocking that occurred last year, ignoring the drastic changes in the market this year. After the public-private partnership in the entire industry, many family members of capitalists joined the workforce, and their children were entrusted to others or nurseries to be fed milk powder; after rural women joined advanced cooperatives, the demand for milk powder also increased; in addition, after wage reforms, the income of the vast number of workers increased, improving their living nutrition, and the demand for milk powder also increased significantly. The commercial departments did not fully estimate the changes in milk powder supply and demand caused by these new situations. Instead of urging the industrial departments to improve quality, increase production, and meet the needs of consumers, they repeatedly reduced inventory and narrowed procurement, adopting the approach of selling out before restocking. At the Ninth National Supply Conference held by China General Merchandise Company in February this year, the supply capacity of milk powder for the second and third quarters of this year was 3.55 million pounds, but the regions only requested 1.38 million pounds, only 38.8% of the supply capacity. The remaining 2 million pounds, the regions resolutely refused to take delivery.
    The result of reducing procurement caused a large artificial backlog in the industrial departments. For example, in the first half of this year, the famous "Red Star" brand milk powder produced by Anda Dairy Factory in Heilongjiang Province was overstocked by 300,000 pounds. The factory's warehouses, dormitories, and offices were filled with milk powder, so that the factory had to reduce production. In 1955, the national milk powder production was about 9 million pounds, and in 1956 (plus the figures after the recent increase in production measures) it is estimated that the maximum production can only be 6.2 million pounds.
    In order to solve the "backlog" of milk powder, the industrial departments took price reduction measures, lowering the price twice, with a reduction of 39%. Due to the reduction in the selling price, the purchase price of fresh milk had to be reduced as well, and the purchase price of fresh milk in Heilongjiang was reduced from 22 cents per kilogram to 14 cents. In addition, efforts were made to reach an agreement with Tianjin Export Corporation to strive to export a portion to solve the domestic "backlog."
    Obviously, the social demand for milk powder in 1956 was greater than in 1955, but the total production was less than in 1955. In particular, the inappropriate reduction of the purchase price of fresh milk hindered the normal development of fresh milk production, so that since the third quarter, a shortage of milk powder has appeared in the market, and it has been difficult to buy milk powder everywhere.
    However, the milk powder shortage is a temporary phenomenon. The Ministry of Food Industry has initially determined to produce 9.6 million pounds of milk powder next year, an increase of 54% compared with this year's estimate. At the same time, at the first National Supply Conference held by China Sugar & Confectionery Company in mid-to-late October, the reasons for the milk powder shortage were examined. At present, the management of milk powder is being strengthened from all aspects, and efforts are being made to strive for sources of goods, so that the milk powder shortage will gradually tend to ease, and the supply work will be done well for consumers.

    奶粉为什么脱销
    朱有仁
    最近，全国各大城市发生奶粉严重脱销，许多妇女工人或职员因买不到奶粉，抱着啼哭的婴儿发愁。单沈阳一地，三季度就收到人民来信一百五十多封，指责商业部门为什么不供应奶粉。
    造成奶粉脱销的根本原因是商业部门的主观主义。他们认为“奶粉是冷背滞销商品，销售数量很小，货源可以随要随到，不进货没啥关系”。他们的经营眼光，局限在去年一度发生积压的圈子里，忽视了今年市场的急剧变化。全行业公私合营以后，不少资本家家属参加了工作，他们的小孩委托别人或托儿所代喂奶粉；农村妇女参加高级社后，所需奶粉也有增加；再加上工资改革以后，广大职工收入增加，改善生活营养，对奶粉的需求也有相当增长。商业部门没有充分估计这些新情况所引起的奶粉供求变化，不但不督促工业部门提高质量，增加产量，满足消费者的需要，反而一再压缩库存，缩小进货，采取卖完再进的作法。在今年2月份中国百货公司召开的全国第九届供应会议上，今年二、三季度奶粉货源的供应能力为三百五十五万磅，各地只要了一百三十八万磅，仅及供应能力的38.8％。剩余二百多万磅，各地坚决不肯要货成交。
    缩小进货的结果，使工业部门造成人为的大量积压。例如：在今年上半年，黑龙江省安达奶厂生产的著名“红星”牌奶粉积压三十万磅，该厂的仓库，宿舍，办公室都堆满了奶粉，以致工厂不得不减少生产。1955年全国奶粉生产量约九百万磅，1956年（加上最近增产措施后的数字）预计最多只能生产六百二十万磅。
    工业部门为了解决奶粉的“积压”，采取了降价措施，先后两次调低价格，调低幅度达39％。由于调低了销售价，不得不也调低了鲜奶的收购价，黑龙江鲜奶收购价从每公斤二角二分降到一角四分。此外还设法和天津出口公司达成协议，争取出口一部分来解决国内的“积压”。
    显然的，1956年奶粉的社会需要量大于1955年，总生产量反而小于1955年，特别是不恰当地降低鲜奶收购价，阻碍了鲜奶生产的正常发展，以致自进入三季度，奶粉就出现市场脱销，各地都很难买到奶粉的紧张情况。
    不过，奶粉脱销是暂时现象。食品工业部已初步确定明年生产奶粉九百六十万磅，较今年预计增长54％。同时，中国糖业糕点公司在10月中下旬召开的第一届全国供应会议上，对奶粉脱销的原因，进行了检查。目前，正在从各方面加强对奶粉的经营，并设法争取货源，使奶粉紧张状况逐步趋向缓和，为消费者做好供应工作。
