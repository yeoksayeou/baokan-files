Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 20th: Anhui Province has formulated a sideline production plan from October this year to May next year. In these eight months, the total income from sideline production in the province's rural areas will reach 200 million yuan. This income will be used to offset the losses suffered by some rural areas due to various natural disasters this year, in order to ensure increased income for agricultural cooperative members.

Since Anhui Province strengthened its leadership in sideline production, sideline production has become increasingly active. At present, 90% of the province's more than 18,000 agricultural cooperatives have carried out various sideline productions in conjunction with agricultural production. According to statistics from five special districts alone, the income from sideline production in October reached more than 13.89 million yuan, an increase of more than two and a half times compared to the average monthly income from sideline production in these areas from January to September. Among this, the income from household sideline production of agricultural cooperative members accounted for about half. This has greatly increased the enthusiasm of cooperative members to engage in sideline production.

    安徽省订出副业生产规划
    新华社合肥20日电　安徽省已经制定出从今年10月到明年5月的副业生产规划。在这八个月中，全省农村副业收益将达到两亿元，这些收益将用来弥补今年部分农村遭受各种自然灾害的损失，以保证农业社社员增加收入。
    安徽省自从加强副业生产的领导以后，副业生产日渐活跃起来。目前全省一万八千多个农业社中，有90％的社结合农业生产开展了各种副业生产。仅据五个专区的统计，10月份副业收益达一千三百八十九万多元，比这些地区1月到9月平均每月副业收益增加了两倍半以上，其中农业社社员家庭副业收益约占一半。这就大大提高了社员从事副业生产的积极性。
