    Delineating the Boundaries of Peasant Trade
    —New Problems After Relaxing Rural Market Management

    Since Guangdong Province successively opened rural markets in September, the number of farmers engaged in commercial activities has increased significantly. In Shantou City, there are often more than 400 farmers engaged in buying and selling. Yangjiang County has recently added 592 small vendors in its nine districts, the majority of whom are members of agricultural cooperatives. The occurrence of this situation is mainly due to some agricultural cooperatives not distinguishing the scope of peasant trade, thinking that doing business is peasant trade. The Wanshou Township Agricultural Cooperative in Qingyuan County has set up three stations specifically to purchase chickens, ducks, and geese from farmers at high prices for resale at a profit. The Xinxing Agricultural Cooperative in Xinsheng Township specially organized manpower to transport chickens to Guangzhou for sale, and then transported bananas back from Guangzhou, earning more than 300 yuan in total. The Shidong Agricultural Cooperative in Longchuan County dispatched more than 40 members to travel back and forth between Jiangxi Province, selling salted fish, ceramics, fermented soybeans, and other goods, with each trip taking half a month. Some county and district cadres, in order to increase the income of farmers, not only fail to educate and stop this phenomenon but instead encourage agricultural cooperatives to engage in commercial activities.

    The continuous increase in farmers engaged in business has produced some adverse consequences. The Lianxing Cooperative in Qingyuan County, despite signing a purchase and sales contract with the trade company for 20 dan of fragrant powder, not only failed to execute it but also purchased 40 dan for transport and sale in Guangzhou. From September 1st to 20th in Boluo County, farmers slaughtered and sold 836 pigs privately, affecting the completion of the state's procurement tasks. Farmers' business activities have also affected the operations of small vendors. The tobacco and fruit small vendors in Tiechang Market in Longchuan County have been squeezed out by farmers' business activities. In Dianbai County, more than 30 catering vendors in the county seat are also experiencing financial difficulties due to dozens of nearby farmers engaging in retail sales of cooked food. The result of too many farmers engaging in business has affected the production and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. In the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Dianbai County, one production team of 40 people dispatched 30 people to do rice noodle and vermicelli business, leaving production unattended. Some cooperatives, instead of organizing members to fight drought in waterlogged paddy fields, dispatched members to work as mobile vendors. In the Maba Agricultural Cooperative in Qujiang, 17 households have already withdrawn from the cooperative to become merchants.

    To solve this problem, it is necessary to strengthen education for farmers. The scope of peasant trade must be explained to farmers. After relaxing market management, farmers can freely trade in small local products where supply exceeds demand or supply and demand are balanced, as well as surplus products after completing the unified purchase tasks. Farmers must understand that peasant trade does not allow farmers to engage in transportation and trading activities, but rather to sell part of the products they produce themselves. At the same time, it is also necessary to explain to farmers, through concrete facts, that blindly engaging in commercial activities often leads to many unexpected losses. In addition, agricultural cooperatives must also pay attention to arranging household sideline occupations for members to increase their personal income.

    划清农民贸易的界限
    ——放宽农村市场管理后的新问题
    广东省从9月份先后开放农村市场以后，农民从事商业活动的纷纷增加。汕头市经常有四百多农民在做买卖。阳江县九个区最近增加了五百九十二个小商贩，其中大多数是农业社的社员。这种情况的发生，主要是有些农业社分不清农民贸易的范围，认为做买卖就是农民贸易。清远县万寿乡农业社专设三个站，高价抢购农民的鸡、鸭、鹅，以转手取利。新生乡新星农业社专门组织人力贩鸡来广州市出卖，又从广州贩回大蕉，先后赚了三百多元。龙川县石东农业社抽出四十多个社员，来往于江西省之间，贩卖咸鱼、陶瓷、豆豉等货物，来回一次要半个月。某些县、区干部为了增加农民的收入，对这种现象不但不加教育制止，反而鼓励农业社去从事商业活动。
    经商的农民不断增加，已产生了一些不良的后果。清远县联星社同贸易公司订的二十担香粉的购销合同，他们不但不执行还买入四十担贩运到广州市出售。博罗县从9月1日至20日，农民自宰出售的生猪有八百三十六头，影响国家收购任务的完成。农民经商也影响到小商贩的经营。龙川县铁场墟烟、果小商贩已被农民经商挤垮。电白县城三十多户饮食业商贩，也因附近几十个农民经营起熟食零售而发生生活困难。过多农民经商的结果已影响到农业社的生产和巩固。电白县五星农业社一个生产队四十人，抽出三十人去做米粉、粉条生意，生产没有人管。有些社禾田受旱，不组织社员抗旱，反抽出社员去做流动商贩。曲江马坝农业社已有十七户退社转商。
    要解决这个问题，必须加强对农民的教育。要向农民说明农民贸易的范围。放宽市场管理以后，农民可以自由贸易的，只是供过于求或供求平衡的小土产，及完成统购任务后的剩余产品。要使农民懂得：农民贸易并不是允许农民去从事贩运经商等活动，而是销售自己生产的部分产品。同时也要通过具体事实，向农民说明盲目从事商业活动，往往会遭到许多意想不到的损失。此外，农业社还必须注意安排社员的家庭副业，以增加社员的个人收入。
