    The Problem of Dormitories Being Far From Workplaces is Not Unsolvable
    Shanghai Organizes Dormitory Swaps for Employees
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 22nd - The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee recently established a "Housing Adjustment Committee" to study methods, within the city, of adjusting work units and relocating residences to bring employees' homes closer to their workplaces, reducing commuting time and the fatigue of long-distance travel. Currently, the electrical, mechanical, commercial, postal and telecommunications, municipal administration, and other thirteen industrial trade unions are mobilizing employees whose homes are far from their workplaces to register, in order to study and adjust their situations.
    According to a recent survey of 720,000 employees by relevant departments, approximately 60,000 employees live more than 15 *li* from their workplaces. Many of these employees work in Pudong but live in Puxi, while another group works in Puxi but lives in Pudong. They spend two to three hours commuting each day and spend a considerable amount of money on transportation each month. Public transportation is also particularly crowded during commuting hours. When it is windy or snowy, travel is even more inconvenient. Because too much time is spent commuting, employees' health, studies, leisure cultural activities, and household management are greatly affected.
    Based on these circumstances and the conditions available in all aspects after the socialist transformation of private enterprises in the city, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee decided to gradually solve this long-standing problem. In the past few months, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, the East China Textile Administration Bureau, and the Shanghai Tobacco Industry Company have found ways to transfer more than 2,400 teachers, workers, and staff to schools and factories closer to their homes. These employees were very satisfied after the transfer. On the 16th, these units introduced their experiences in this regard to other units in the city.

    宿舍离工作地点远的问题并非不能解决
    上海组织职工调换宿舍
    新华社上海22日电　上海市人民委员会最近成立“房屋调整委员会”，研究在全市范围内用调动工作单位和迁换住屋等的办法，使职工的住所靠近工作地点，减少上下班的时间和长途乘车的疲劳。现在电业、机械、商业、邮电、市政等十三个产业工会正在发动住家离工作地点较远的职工登记，以便加以研究和调整。
    据有关部门最近在七十二万职工中的调查，约有六万多职工的住所距离工作地点在十五里以上。其中不少职工工作地点在沪东，家在沪西；而另一部分职工恰恰工作地点在沪西，而家在沪东。他们每天上下班要花两三个小时，每月要支出一笔相当可观的车费。各种公共车辆在上下班的时间也因此特别拥挤。逢到刮风下雪，来回更不方便。由于往返所花时间太多，职工的健康、学习、业余文化生活和料理家务都受到很大的影响。
    上海市人民委员会根据这些情况和在全市私营企业社会主义改造以后各方面具备的条件，决定逐步解决这个长期以来没有解决的问题。在前几个月，上海市教育局、华东纺织管理局和上海烟草工业公司等单位已经设法把二千四百多个教员、工人、职员调到了离他们住所较近的学校、工厂去工作。这些职工在调动以后都感到非常满意。在16日，这些单位把这方面的经验向全市其他单位作了介绍。
