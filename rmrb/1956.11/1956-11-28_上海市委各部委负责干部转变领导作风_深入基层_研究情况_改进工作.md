    This newspaper reports: The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of responsible cadres from various departments and commissions on the 9th of this month. The meeting thoroughly discussed issues such as changing subjectivist and bureaucratic work styles, overcoming complacency, discovering problems, and summarizing experiences to prepare for formulating next year's work plan. After the meeting, each department and commission arranged their work based on the spirit of the meeting, and leading comrades from each department and commission personally led groups of cadres to form work teams, which went to grassroots units to understand the situation, summarize experiences, and help the grassroots improve their work.

    The Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, led by Minister Xu Dejian, has already dispatched six section chiefs, three division chiefs, and five staff members to Xuhui, Zhabei, and Yulin districts, as well as directly-affiliated factories of the Municipal Committee, to inspect work. They will start with professional work such as cadre work, organizational guidance, and Party building, and gradually inspect the implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines, the relationship between the Party and the masses, and the ideological situation of Party members and the masses both inside and outside the Party. The goal is to summarize experiences and lessons, propose future work directions, and formulate next year's organizational work plan.

    The Finance and Trade Work Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, led by its ministers, deputy ministers, and section chiefs, will focus on the three industries closely related to people's lives—department stores, food, and textiles—and take turns going to state-owned, joint state-private stores, small shops, and stalls to inspect and study financial and trade work. The Supervision Committee, led by Deputy Secretary Ma Jian, has divided nineteen cadres into three groups, and they have gone to Putuo, Huangpu, and Xincheng districts to understand and study the organizational construction of the district supervision committees and issues in the implementation of policies. The head of the Political and Legal Work Department and section chiefs have led more than twenty cadres to Yangpu and Zhabei districts and some police stations to inspect the work style and policy thinking of cadres in the district's political and legal departments, and to study issues such as mutual restraint and cooperation among the public security, procuratorial, and court departments. The Propaganda Department, led by Minister Shi Ximin, has dispatched thirty-one cadres to several districts and several industrial and commercial enterprises, as well as newspaper offices and publishing houses, to understand the current ideological situation of cadres and Party members, and to study the propaganda of several important current policies. The heads of the Heavy Industry Work Department and the Light Industry Work Department have both led groups of cadres to factories and enterprises to understand and study the continued in-depth development of the advanced producer movement, the relationship between the Party and the masses, the collective leadership of the Party committee, and further strengthening the work of newly established joint state-private enterprises. The United Front Work Department, led by Deputy Minister Wang Zhizhong, has dispatched two section chiefs and three division chiefs to government agencies, factories, and schools to understand the relationship between the Party and the masses, the role of non-Party members, the relationship between public and private parties, and the implementation of policies toward senior intellectuals, and to summarize the united front work of grassroots organizations. Other departments, commissions, and the General Office of the Municipal Committee have also sent leading comrades to lead groups of cadres to the grassroots to carry out work, or are preparing to go deep into the grassroots.

    After leading comrades of various departments and commissions take the lead in going deep into the grassroots and understanding the situation, they will further formulate plans to go deep into the grassroots and among the masses. The responsible comrades will also regularly go down in rotation to establish a work style of linking with reality and linking with the masses, and resolutely overcome subjectivism and bureaucracy.
