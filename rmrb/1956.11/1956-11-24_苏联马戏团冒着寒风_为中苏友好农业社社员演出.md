Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: The performers of the Soviet Circus braved the cold wind at noon today to give an open-air performance for the members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in the western suburbs of Beijing.

Thousands of cooperative members lined the streets to welcome the Soviet artists. Among the crowd were many white-haired old women and children held in their mothers' arms. People were beating drums and gongs, as if celebrating a New Year festival.

The performance took place on the grounds of the township people's committee courtyard.

This small courtyard was packed with thousands of people. Many who could not enter the courtyard watched from the surrounding rooftops, walls, and trees. Suddenly, Boris Vyatkin, Honored Artist and clown, appeared on the wall, greeting the farmers in Chinese. His several performances repeatedly caused the audience to burst into laughter. Honored Artist F. Hertz, bare-chested and bare-legged, braved the cold wind to perform feats of strength, and the audience responded to his enthusiasm with loud applause. The Soviet artists also performed comedic music and martial arts.

After the performance, the cooperative director, on behalf of the members, presented the guests with peanuts, cabbage, and radishes, the cooperative's special products. Asanov, the head of the circus troupe, expressed his gratitude for the cooperative members' hospitality.

Before the performance, the cooperative members also invited the Soviet artists to watch a documentary film of the naming ceremony of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in February of this year. (Picture attached)

On November 23, the Soviet Circus, which was invited to our country for a performance tour, visited the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shijingshan District, western suburbs of Beijing, for a performance. This is a scene of the Soviet artists performing wonderful programs for the members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative.

    苏联马戏团冒着寒风
    为中苏友好农业社社员演出
    新华社23日讯　苏联马戏团的演员们今天中午冒着寒风到北京西郊，为中苏友好农业生产合作社的社员们作了一次露天演出。
    上千的社员们，夹道欢迎苏联艺术家。人群中有许多白发的老大娘和抱在妈妈怀里的孩子。人们敲锣打鼓，好像过年过节一样。
    演出是在乡人民委员会院子里场地上进行的。
    在这个不大的院子里挤满了上千的人。许多不能进院子的人站在四周的房顶上、墙头上、树上观看。突然，功勋演员、滑稽表演家鲍里斯·维亚特金在墙头上出现了，他用中国话向农民们问好。他表演的几个节目，一再逗得满场观众捧腹大笑。功勋演员符·赫尔茨赤身露腿迎着寒风表演了力量杂耍，观众用响亮的掌声答谢他的热情。苏联艺术家们还表演了滑稽音乐和武术等。
    在演出结束以后，社主任代表社员把这个社特产的花生、白菜、萝卜赠给客人们。马戏团团长阿萨诺夫对社员们的招待表示感谢。
    在演出前，社员们还请苏联艺术家们观看了今年2月中苏友好农业生产合作社命名大会的纪录影片。（附图片）
    11月23日应邀来我国作访问演出的苏联马戏团到北京西郊石景山区中苏友好农业生产合作社进行访问演出。这是苏联艺术家们正给中苏友好农业生产合作社的社员们演出精彩节目。
