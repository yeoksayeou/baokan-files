  "My government is paying very close attention to the development of the situation caused by the armed aggression against Egypt in the Middle East."
    Bourguiba asked the President of the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to do his utmost to "prompt the Assembly to take steps to end the current armed aggression suffered by Egypt, and to withdraw those foreign troops that violate the territorial integrity of Egypt in disregard of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter."

The Moroccan government protested this act of aggression and expressed complete solidarity with the Egyptian people.

    据新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：突尼斯和摩洛哥两国政府都通过它们驻美国的大使在11月1日向联合国大会紧急会议提出呼吁，要求制止英法对埃及的侵略。
  突尼斯首相布尔吉巴在给联合国大会紧急会议主席的电报中说：
  “我的政府非常关切地注意对埃及的武装侵略在中东所造成的局势的发展。”
    布尔吉巴要求联合国大会紧急会议的主席竭力“促使大会采取步骤，来结束埃及目前所遭受的武装侵略，并且使那些不顾联合国宪章的宗旨和原则的侵犯埃及领土完整的外国军队撤退”。
    摩洛哥政府在给联合国秘书长的电报中指责法国英国和以色列共谋进行的对埃及的侵略造成了严重的局势，它威胁着全世界的和平，并且侮蔑了联合国组织和违反了联合国宪章的原则。摩洛哥政府对这种侵略行为提出抗议，并且表示同埃及人民完全团结一致。
