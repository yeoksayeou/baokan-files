　　Dalian Port Has Great Potential
　　By our reporter Fan Rongkang
　　Standing on the office building of the Dalian Port Authority and overlooking Dalian Port, one truly feels its extraordinary grandeur. The blue, gentle sea is as calm as a mirror. The crescent-shaped breakwater, thousands of meters long, stretches across the vast sea. Inside the breakwater, alongside the jagged wharves, totaling over ten thousand meters in length, are countless giant ships from all over the world. Hundred-ton A-frame cranes perform handstands like giants. The huge booms of dozens of quay cranes are neatly arranged on the docks. The arms of the cranes inside the high-rise warehouses reach out, and the lowered hooks, like eagles catching chicks, lift large quantities of goods and hide them in the warehouses. Workers ride light electric vehicles, shuttling between the warehouses and the holds of the ships. Dalian Port, the water gateway to Northeast China, is famous at home and abroad for its deep water, ice-free conditions, and its large amount of modern machinery and huge throughput capacity.
　　The docks are busy with loading and unloading. At the entrance to the channel, another large ship, from who knows what country, sails in. I asked Director Tan Songping, "I heard that Dalian Port was severely congested a few months ago. What's the situation now?"
　　Director Tan Songping replied decisively: "No, Dalian Port has never been congested. It was just a bit tense in July and August, and that has completely passed now."
　　This was a truly unexpected answer. What is the difference between tension and congestion?
　　Perhaps sensing my doubt, Director Tan explained: "Of course, it's hard to say exactly what the difference is between congestion and tension, and what the boundary is. However, I can provide you with this information: Historically, Dalian Port's highest annual throughput was 12 million tons. That was during the Japanese occupation. At that time, the mechanical equipment was about the same as it is now, and there wasn't as much as there is now; as for the workers, there were many more than there are now. But who were the workers working for then? The Japanese. Naturally, the efficiency was very low, only six tons per work shift, and that was only one shift. What about now? The work shift efficiency is sixteen tons, working three shifts. Therefore, whether analyzing from the equipment factor or the human factor, we have no reason to doubt that Dalian Port can handle 12 million tons of cargo per year."
　　"That's right, Dalian Port was mainly built by the Japanese. The mechanical equipment at Dalian Port was installed to meet the needs of Japanese imperialism in plundering our country's resources; it is not entirely suitable for the needs of our national economy," Director Tan continued. "Take the Gan Jingzi operating area, for example! There, we have a complete set of mechanized coal loading equipment. During the Japanese occupation, hundreds of thousands of tons of coal were shipped out every month. Now, most of the coal in the Northeast meets the needs of the Northeast's own industry, and the amount exported is very small, so it is impossible to give full play to the efficiency of the equipment. This has a great impact on fulfilling Dalian Port's throughput tasks. Alright! Let's put these factors aside and remove this type of dedicated mechanical equipment, then Dalian Port can still handle at least 7 million tons of cargo a year. What is our annual task now? About 5 million tons. How can we say it's congested!"
　　These words left me speechless. Although I don't agree with the statement that "it's not congestion, it's tension," I have to change my past view that Dalian Port's throughput capacity has reached saturation.
　　But why was Dalian Port also "a bit tense" in July and August this year? Why have some ships historically gone to Dalian Port and then transferred to other ports because they couldn't be unloaded in time? Director Tan said: "This is a management issue. We haven't fully grasped the characteristics of port work. The purpose of port work is to accelerate the turnover of materials as quickly as possible, but our work often fails to adapt to this purpose."
　　Although I have only lived in Dalian Port for a short time, I also deeply feel, on the ground and in conversations with some comrades, that adapting to the characteristics of port work to manage and use the port is still a problem that has not been completely solved. Some of these are the port authority's own work problems, which can and should be improved through the port authority's own efforts, but some, and usually some more fundamental problems, cannot be completely solved by the port authority's own efforts.
　　I visited some front warehouses, which are close to the docks. Except for a portion of the goods that are directly loaded onto ships and trains, most of the goods unloaded from ships and trains are stored in the front warehouses, waiting for ships and trains to come before being transported out. Whether the goods in the front warehouses can be turned over quickly is the key to whether the materials of the entire port can be turned over quickly. However, in the front warehouses of Dalian Port, I saw many goods that had been stored for more than ten days, twenty days, or even more than a month without being transported out. There are many reasons, but one important reason is that the current fee system cannot stimulate the turnover of materials in the front warehouses. A contracted system is now implemented. The cargo owner only pays the port authority a one-time unloading fee, loading fee, and storage fee. The storage fee is calculated for three days, regardless of the actual storage time. The advantage of this fee system is that the procedures are simple, which greatly stimulates cargo owners to concentrate materials in the front warehouses – the front line of the port – as soon as possible. No one wants to store goods in the rear warehouses to increase loading and unloading and incur more costs. However, the disadvantage of this fee system is that a large amount of goods are concentrated in the front warehouses, occupying the limited capacity of the front warehouses, and the goods in the front warehouses cannot actually be turned over once in three days. The old doesn't go, the new comes, and the front warehouses are often crowded. When ships come, there is no place to unload the goods, and when trains come, there is no place to unload the goods, which causes congestion.
　　Therefore, studying how to further improve the port fee system, both to stimulate cargo owners to concentrate goods in the front warehouses as soon as possible and to ensure the fullest use of the capacity of the front warehouses, is a very important issue.
　　Closely related to this issue is the connection between maritime and railway plans. Cargo owners and ports certainly hope that all goods can be transported out as soon as possible, and the shorter the turnover time, the better. However, this only reflects one aspect of the problem – the need. As for whether it is possible, although cargo owners and ports can do their best to strive for it, the fundamental issue lies in whether there are ships and trains. The shortcoming of the current fee system is that it places too much emphasis on needs and ignores possibilities. Especially for ports like Dalian, where the vast majority of throughput is transferred to other places, the failure of maritime and railway plans to connect well is like having one's neck strangled. A batch of goods transshipped in Dalian Port, the railway side approves the cargo owner's consignment plan and undertakes it; the shipping side may not approve the plan and may not have the ability to undertake it, so it accumulates in Dalian Port. Even if both the railway and shipping sides approve the plan, the dates will always be up and down. When the train arrives, the ship may not arrive; when the ship arrives, the train may not arrive. In this way, it will also accumulate in Dalian Port for a period of time.
　　Therefore, while improving the port fee system, how to organize the connection of railway and maritime plans, especially how to organize multimodal transport to ensure the smooth flow of port materials and accelerate the speed of material turnover, is also a very important issue.
　　In the warehouses and storage yards of Dalian Port, you can see the following situation at any time: the same goods, the same variety and specifications, need to be transported to the same location at the same time by the same ship, but because they belong to different cargo owners, they must be stored separately, even if the quantity is small, they cannot be mixed together. The same is true when loading in the ship's hold. The characteristic of ship transport is large tonnage and few hatches, which is suitable for loading large quantities of goods. However, because the goods are separated at the place of shipment, they must also be separated on the ship. This dispersed phenomenon of transportation brings very unfavorable consequences to ports and ships. The capacity of warehouses, storage yards, and ships cannot be fully utilized, and the loading and unloading time is prolonged. Some comrades from the Dalian Port Authority have proposed whether it is possible to establish material distribution departments in the main material distribution centers along the coast, and each unit can apply to these material distribution departments for materials nearby. In this way, maritime transport can be consolidated from fragmented loads. I think this suggestion is worth considering.
　　Dalian Port has great potential. To tap this potential, it depends not only on the Dalian Port Authority itself, but also deserves the joint consideration of the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Railways, and the various departments that use the port.

    大连港的潜力还很大
    本报记者　范荣康
    登上大连区港务管理局的办公大楼，鸟瞰大连港，真有气派非凡的感觉。蓝色的、温柔的海水平静如镜。长达数千公尺的、弯月形的防波堤伸展在辽阔的海面上。防波堤内，总长一万多公尺的锯齿形的码头旁，停泊着一时难以数清数目的，来自世界各国的巨型轮船。一举百吨的人字起重机，像一个巨人在那里表演倒立的姿态。数十台岸壁式起重机的巨大的吊杆，整齐地排列在码头上。高层仓库内探出库内起重机的臂梁，放下来的吊钩，就像老鹰抓小鸡一样，一下子就把大宗货物吊起来藏到仓库里去。工人们踩着一辆辆轻巧的电动车，在仓库和轮船的舱口旁川流不息。大连港，这个东北的水上门户，以水深、不冻，以拥有大量现代化的机械设备和巨大的吞吐能力，而闻名国内外。
    码头上，装卸忙。航道口，又有一只不知是那个国家的大轮船驰了进来。我向谭松平局长问道：“听说前几个月大连港堵塞得很厉害，现在情况怎么样？”
    谭松平局长断然答道：“不，大连港从来没有堵塞过，只是7、8月份有点紧张，现在也完全过去了。”
    这真是个出乎意外的答复。紧张和堵塞有什么不同呢？
    大概是识透了我的疑问，谭局长解释道：“当然，堵塞和紧张有什么不同、以什么为界限还很难说清楚。不过，我可以向你提供这样一个材料：历史上，大连港的最高年吞吐量曾经到过一千二百万吨。那是日本人统治的时候。那时候，“机械设备也同现在差不多，而且还没有现在这么多；至于工人，比现在多多了。可是，那时候工人为谁干活呢？为日本人。效率自然很低，一个工班才六吨，而且还是一班作业。现在呢？工班效率十六吨，三班捣。因此，无论从设备因素，从人的因素来分析，我们都没有任何理由怀疑，大连港每年是可以吞吐一千二百万吨货物的。”
    “不错，大连港主要是日本人建设起来的。大连港的机械设备，是适应日本帝国主义掠夺我国的资源而安装的；它不能完全适合我国国民经济的需要。”谭局长继续说：“例如甘井子作业区吧！那里有全套机械化的装煤设备，日本统治时期每个月都要运出几十万吨煤，现在，东北的煤大都满足东北本地区工业的需要，出口的数量很少，也就不可能充分发挥设备效能了。这对于充实大连港的吞吐任务有很大的影响。好吧！我们把这些因素都丢开，把这类专用的机械设备去掉，那么，大连港一年至少也可以吞吐七百万吨货物。现在我们一年的任务是多少呢？五百万吨左右。怎么说也不能堵塞呵！”
    这一席话，说得我哑口无言。我虽然并不同意“不是堵塞，是紧张”的说法，但是，也不得不改变了过去那种认为大连港的吞吐能力已经达到饱和的程度的看法。
    可是，为什么大连港今年7、8月也“有点紧张”呢？为什么历年来总有一些船只到了大连港，因为不能及时卸货，而转到别的港口去呢？谭局长说：“这是管理上的问题，是我们还没有很好地掌握港口工作的特点。港口工作的目的是尽快地加速物资周转，可是我们的工作常常不能适应这个目的。”
    我在大连港生活的时间虽然很短，但在现场上，在同一些同志的谈话中，也深深感到，适应港口工作的特点，来管理港口，使用港口，还是一个没有完全解决的问题。这里，有些是港务局本身的工作问题，可以由，也应该由港务局自己努力来改进，但有些，而且通常总是有些更根本性的问题，却不完全是港务局本身的努力所能解决的。
    我参观了一些前方仓库，这些仓库紧靠着码头。除了一部分直接装船、装车的货物外，大部分从轮船上和从火车上卸下来的货物，都要在前方仓库里堆存着，等船来了，车来了，再运出去。前方仓库里的货物能不能尽快地周转，是整个港口的物资能不能尽快地周转的关键。然而，在大连港的前方仓库里，我看到的货物，有许多已经堆存了十几天、二十几天，甚至一个多月还没有运出去。原因很多，但有一条是很重要的：现在的收费制度不能刺激前方仓库的物资周转。现在实行着一种包干制。货主托运货物只向港务局交一次卸车费，装船费和堆存费。堆存费不论实际堆存时间的长短，一概按三天计算。这种收费制度的好处是手续简便，大大刺激了货主把物资尽快地集中到前方仓库——港口第一线来，谁也不愿意把货物堆放在后方仓库里增一次捣载，多一次费用。可是，这种收费制度的坏处是，大量货物集中到前方仓库来，占据了前方仓库有限的容积，而前方仓库的货物实际上不可能在三天之内周转一次。旧的不去，新的又来，前方仓库经常拥挤。船来了，货没处卸，车来了，货也没处卸，就造成堵塞。
    因此，研究怎样来进一步地改进港口收费制度，既刺激货主尽快地把货物集中到前方仓库，又保证最充分地使用前方仓库的容积，是一个很重要的问题。
    同这个问题紧相联系的，是海运和铁路计划的衔接问题。货主和港口当然希望所有的货物都能尽快地运出去，周转时间越短越好。然而，这只反映问题的一个方面——需要。至于是否可能，虽然货主和港口方面都可以尽一些力量来争取，但根本问题还在于有没有船，有没有车。现行的收费制度的缺点，就是偏重需要，忽视可能而造成的。特别是像大连这样的港口，吞吐量中绝大部分都是中转到其他地方去的；海运和铁路的计划不能很好的衔接，对大连港说来，就好像脖子给人家卡住了。一批在大连港中转的货物，铁路方面批准了货主的托运计划，承运下来；海运方面却未必批准这个计划，未必有能力承运，于是，就在大连港积压下来。即使铁路和海运方面都批准了这个计划，但日期方面总有上下。车到了，船未必到；船来了，车未必来。这样，也要在大连港积压一个时期。
    因此，在改进港口收费制度的同时，怎样来组织铁路和海运计划的衔接，特别是怎样组织水陆联运，保证港口物资畅通无阻，加速物资周转的速度，也是一个很重要的问题。
    在大连港的仓库里和堆场上，随时可以看到这样的情形：同样的货物，同样的品种规格，要在同一个时间里，用同一只船，运到同一个地点去，只因为它们分属于不同的货主，就得分开来堆放，那怕数量再少，也不能混淆在一起。装在船舱里也是一样。船舶运输的特点是吨位大、舱口少，它适宜装大宗货物。但是，因为货物从发货地就分了家，到船上也得分家。这种运输的分散现象，给港口和船舶带来很不利的后果。仓库、堆场和船舶的容积不能充分利用，装卸作业的时间拖得很久。大连区港务管理局的一些同志提出，是不是可以在沿海主要物资集散地，设立物资分配部门，各个单位就近向这些物资分配部门申请物资。这样，海上运输就可以化零为整了。我想，这个意见是可以考虑的。
    大连港的潜力很大，想把这些潜力发掘出来，不单要靠大连港务局本身，同时也是值得交通部以及铁道部和各个使用港口的部门共同考虑的。
