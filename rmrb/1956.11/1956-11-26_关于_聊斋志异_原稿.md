To the editor regarding the original manuscript of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio":

    I have read Mr. Wang Tongzhao's "Several Anecdotes About Pu Songling," which has helped me learn a great deal about the deeds of my ancestor and has greatly enhanced the glory of his literary legacy. I am deeply grateful.

    However, the first half of the "Original Manuscript of Strange Tales" was handed over by me to County Magistrate Liu Botao in Xifeng County, Liaoning Province, after liberation, to be sent to the Central Ministry of Culture.

    This original manuscript consists of eight thick volumes, re-organized and bound from individual pieces. It was brought to Shenyang from Shandong by my ancestor, Pu Jiaren. At the same time, there was also a most precious scroll, "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio Entertainment Picture," a huge painting six zhang long, which was sold cheaply by my late uncle, Yingfang. Later, I heard that this huge picture was acquired by Wang Jianai, the Commissioner of the Shenyang Tax Supervisory Office of the Puppet Manchukuo. If the government makes great efforts to find the descendants of Wang Jianai, it should not be difficult to obtain it.

    This first half of the original manuscript was handed over to me by my late father for safekeeping. It has been in my possession for more than thirty years. During this period, despite threats and enticements from Japanese and Chinese traitors such as Yuan Jinkai and Chen Shuliu, it was never taken away. It is truly fortunate that it is now in the custody of our government, and I am fortunate as well. Now I would like to take this opportunity to verify the history of this original manuscript and hope to convey this information to Mr. Wang Tongzhao.

### 关于“聊斋志异”原稿

    关于“聊斋志异”原稿编辑同志：
    王统照先生所写的“有关蒲松龄的几则琐谈”，我看到了，使我知道了很多的关于我先祖的事迹，并使先祖的遗墨增光不少，深为感激。
    但所谈的那上半部“聊斋原稿”是解放后我在辽宁西丰县的时候，交由刘伯涛县长送交中央文化部的。
    这部原稿全八厚册，是由零篇重行整理装订的。由我先祖蒲价人从山东原籍带到沈阳。同时尚有最可宝贵的一卷“聊斋行乐图”，长有六丈的巨幅，由先叔父英芳廉价售出，后来听说这幅巨图为伪满沈阳税务监督署长王家鼐所得，倘由政府大力找到王家鼐的后人，谅不难得到。
    这上半部原稿由先父交由我手保管，已有三十余年，中间经日人和汉奸袁金凯、陈漱六等威胁利诱，始终未被夺去，现归我政府来保管实在是这半部原稿的幸运，也是鄙人的幸运。现在我愿趁此机会证实这部原稿的流落经过，并希望转达王统照先生。
