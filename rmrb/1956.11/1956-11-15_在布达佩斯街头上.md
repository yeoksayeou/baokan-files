　　On the streets of Budapest, the wounds of battle strongly stimulate people's eyes. This spring I had seen the bustling crowds, the clanging trams, and the beautiful buses, but now what lies before me are destroyed tram tracks and overhead wires scattered on the road, broken bricks, shattered glass, and scraps of paper everywhere. The famous National Museum has been partially burned down. Rakoczy Street, where the "Free People's Daily" and the large department store are located, is marked by broken walls and windows, and the traces of war are visible everywhere.

　　However, peaceful life has finally arrived. On several main streets, the gradually increasing number of pedestrians walk peacefully. Most of the food stores are open, with long lines in front of the doors. Residents are buying bread, potatoes, sugar, and vegetables in order. Government officials told reporters that due to transportation difficulties, food supply remains a serious problem facing Budapest. On Sunday, the bread in the food stores was sold out by noon. As we walked down the street that day, we were approached by a middle-aged man carrying several loaves of bread home. He asked us with concern if we needed bread. In these difficult times, this ordinary expression made us feel the warmth of friendship in our hearts.

　　I clearly remember that when I arrived in Budapest a few days ago, whirlwinds were sweeping up large piles of withered yellow leaves on the streets, creating a desolate scene. Gunfire could be heard from time to time. People walking on the street were constantly in danger of being attacked by hidden bandits. Just the day after we arrived here (November 8th), desperate bandits opened fire on women queuing to buy bread, killing five innocent women. On this day, the bandits robbed and set fires in various places. The large department store was robbed of goods worth one million forints before Soviet troops and police arrived to stop them. In a word, counter-revolutionary bandits wanted to use bloody terror to prevent the restoration of order in the city. In order to give these bandits one last chance to turn over a new leaf, the Soviet military commandant and the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government issued orders, promising lenient treatment to those who voluntarily surrendered their weapons. At this time, "Radio Free Europe" broadcast in Hungarian, encouraging counter-revolutionary elements not to surrender their weapons but to hide them. Here, revolution and counter-revolution were engaged in a close-quarters battle.

　　On the morning of November 8th, we were sitting in the spacious office of Rubin, the director of the Information Department of the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He walked to the window and asked us to look at the many American, British, and West German cars parked in front of the Foreign Ministry building. Some of the cars were painted with red crosses, and some were covered with the American Stars and Stripes. He pointed his finger and said, "After the Hungarian incident, hundreds of Western journalists rushed to Budapest overnight. Some were in such a hurry that they didn't even bring their passports. Now they are flocking to the Foreign Ministry, and their only request is to be issued documents so that they can safely return home." When we left Director Rubin, many people speaking English and wearing khaki raincoats were clamoring. Someone told me that in the past few days they had been so arrogant, sending out tens of thousands of words of reports every day, stirring up a wave of anti-socialism. Now it seems that they have lost the motivation to work and the "free market" to operate in.

　　Here, one can feel at any time that domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces are carrying out one counterattack after another. On November 10th, a piece of news published in the "Free People's Daily," the organ of the Socialist Workers' Party, was shocking. The news said that during the inspection of one hundred aircraft that arrived on November 2nd and November 3rd, it was found that some of the medical supplies, donated by the Western Red Cross and marked with red crosses, contained weapons, and that some of the people escorting the supplies were Horthy officers who had fled to West Germany. In view of this shocking fact, the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government had no choice but to announce the temporary suspension of so-called relief supplies brought in by the Western Red Cross. The grim struggle has taught people that when necessary, counter-revolutionary elements can operate under various disguises and can even use the humanitarian Red Cross flag to cover up murderous fascist officers.

　　In Kossuth Square in Pest stands an arched building in the eighteenth-century style, which is the Parliament Building. The Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government is working here. After a period of pause, the government, which protects the interests of the people, is working at full speed. The work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Finance is being stepped up. Under the instructions of Minister of Armed Forces and Public Security Münnich, the Hungarian Defense Forces and the People's Police are being organized, and some have already begun to perform their duties. The Minister of Agriculture reported the current situation to the farmers, calling on them to work hard to complete the autumn harvest. The Ministry of Agriculture will strive to support production cooperatives and individual farmers, and announced that agricultural production cooperatives must be developed according to the principle of voluntariness. In order to improve people's lives, the government announced a number of measures, including increasing wages by 10 to 15 percent, abolishing the 4 percent childless tax, and allowing the original owners to redeem items worth less than 500 forints that were mortgaged in pawnshops free of charge. In the city, the work of clearing the streets and inspecting traffic lines is beginning. Workers' pickets are also being organized, with the task of protecting the safety of factories and residents. Major General Grebennik, commander of the Soviet military garrison in Budapest, also called on residents to actively participate in the work of restoring order.

　　It must be admitted that Budapest is still in serious difficulty. But the development of the situation is beneficial to socialist Hungary.

    在布达佩斯街头上
    本报记者　胡思升
    在布达佩斯的街头上，战斗的创伤强烈地刺激着人们的眼睛。今年春天我曾经看见过这里熙攘的人群、叮噹作响的电车和漂亮的公共汽车，但现在摆在面前的是破坏了的电车轨道和散在马路上的架空电线，断砖、碎玻璃和纸片遍地皆是，闻名的民族博物馆被焚毁了一部分，“自由人民报”和大百货公司所在的拉科兹街，断墙破窗，战火的痕迹到处可见。
    但是，和平的生活终究来到了，几条主要的街道上，逐渐增多的行人安祥地走着，大部分食品店都已营业，门口排着长长的行列，居民们在按次序购买面包、土豆、糖和蔬菜。政府人士告诉记者，由于运输方面的困难，食品供应仍然是布达佩斯面临的一个严重问题。星期日，食品店的面包到中午就已经售光，我们这一天在街上行走时，迎面走来一位捧着几个面包回家的中年人，他关心地问我们是不是需要面包；在这种艰难时刻的这种普通的表示，使我们的心里感觉到了友谊的温暖。
    我清楚地记得，前两天我到布达佩斯的时候，旋风卷着街道上大堆枯黄的树叶，一片冷清景象，不时可以听见枪声。人们在街上行走，随时有被躲藏起来的匪徒袭击的危险。就在我们到达这里的第二天（?11月8日），绝望的匪徒们曾向排队购买面包的妇女开枪射击，有五名无辜的妇女死亡。匪徒们在这一天四出抢劫和纵火，大百货公司被匪徒们抢走价值一百万福林的货物，随后被苏军和警察赶到制止。一句话，反革命匪徒想用血的恐怖来阻止城市秩序的恢复。为了给这些匪徒以最后自新的机会，苏军城防司令和匈牙利工农革命政府发布命令，给自动缴枪的人以宽大待遇。就在这个时候，“自由欧洲”电台传来了匈牙利语的广播，鼓动反革命分子不要缴枪，把枪藏起来。在这里，革命和反革命进行着短兵相接的肉搏战。
    11月8日上午，我们坐在匈牙利外交部新闻司司长鲁宾的宽敞的办公室里。他走到窗前要我们看外交部大楼前停靠着的许多各种牌号的美国、英国和西德的小汽车，汽车上面有的漆着红十字，有的复盖着美国星条旗。他用手指点了一下说：“在匈牙利事件发生后，有成百名西方国家的记者星夜赶来布达佩斯，有的匆忙赶到连护照都没有带，现在他们蜂拥到外交部的唯一要求是：发给证件，让他们安全回国。”我们离别鲁宾司长出来时，许多个操英语、穿着卡叽布雨衣的人在乱嚷。有人告诉我，在前几天他们是多么嚣张呀，每天拍发数万字的报道，掀起一股反社会主义的浪潮。现在看来，他们已经失去了工作的动力和活动的“自由市场”。
    在这里随时可以感觉到国内外反革命势力在进行着一次又一次的反扑。11月10日，社会主义工人党机关报“自由人民报”登载的一条消息使人大吃一惊。这条消息说，在检查11月2日和11月3日飞来的一百架飞机时，发现这些由西方红十字会赠送的上面印有红十字的医药物品中，有一部分是武器，而护送物品的人中间有一部分是逃亡在西德的霍尔蒂军官。鉴于这种触目惊心的事实，匈牙利工农革命政府不得已宣布暂时停止由西方运来红十字会的所谓救济物品。严酷的斗争教育了人们：在必要的时候，反革命分子是可以披着各种外衣进行活动的，甚至可以用人道的红十字旗来掩盖杀气腾腾的法西斯军官。
    在佩斯的科苏特广场，矗立着一座有十八世纪风格的拱门状建筑，这是国会大厦。匈牙利工农革命政府就在这里工作。在停顿了一段时期以后，保护人民利益的政府正在全力动作起来。外交部、农业部、财政部的工作正在加紧进行。在武装部队和公安部长明尼奇的指令下，匈牙利的国防军和人民警察正在组织起来，有一部分已经开始执行任务。农业部长向农民报告目前的形势，号召农民努力完成秋收工作，农业部将努力支持生产合作社和个体农民，并宣布一定要根据自愿的原则来发展农业生产合作社。为了改善人民生活，政府宣布了一些措施，其中包括提高工资百分之十到十五，取消百分之四的无子女税，抵押在当铺中的五百福林以下的东西原物主可以无偿地收回等等办法。在市内，清除街道和检查交通线路的工作正在开始进行。工人纠察队也正在组织，任务是保护工厂和居民的安全。布达佩斯苏军城防司令部司令格列拜尼克少将也号召居民积极参加恢复秩序的工作。
    应该承认，布达佩斯现在还处在严重的困难之中。但是局势的发展是有利于社会主义的匈牙利的。
