Reaction to Criticism

    Improved Medical System
    The opinion expressed by Comrade Lu Wen, published in the People's Daily on October 25th, that the medical system of the First Outpatient Department of our hospital was not good and suggesting improvements, is correct. We thank the reader for their criticism. The telephone appointment and limited quota consultation system of our hospital have been abolished successively.
    In the past, our hospital was responsible for the preventive medical tasks of more than 62,000 employees and their families. Due to the shortage of medical staff, there was overcrowding and a few people could not register. At that time, in order to eliminate overcrowding and confusion, we intended to reduce the waste of patients' time through telephone appointments and quota appointments for collective dormitories, but this did not solve the fundamental problem. In order to completely solve the problem, we have now signed entrusted medical contracts with twenty-one medical units, including Jinan City Jurentang Traditional Chinese Medicine Physicians, Jinan City Shizhong District, Huaiyin District, Tianqiao District Joint Medical Institutions and their affiliated clinics, which has basically eliminated the phenomenon of overcrowding and inability to register. However, it cannot be said that the new measures are completely without shortcomings. In the future, we should pay attention to constantly discovering problems and gradually solving them according to the actual situation.

### 改进了看病制度

专栏：对批评的反应

    改进了看病制度
    10月25日人民日报刊载的路闻同志反映我院第一门诊部看病制度不好并建议改进的意见是正确的。我们感谢读者的批评。本院电话预约和限额诊病制度已先后废除。
    过去我院负担着六万二千多职工及家属的预防医疗任务。由于诊疗工作人员不足，存在着看病拥挤和有少数人挂不上号的现象。那时为了消除拥挤和混乱现象，拟通过电话预约及集体宿舍定额预约，以减少病员时间上的浪费，但并没有解决根本问题。为了使问题彻底解决，现在我们已经先后同济南市居仁堂中医师，济南市市中区、槐荫区、天桥区联合医疗机构及其所属分诊所二十一个诊疗单位，订立了委托医疗合同，使看病拥挤和挂不上号的现象基本上消除了。但新的措施还不能说完全没有缺点，今后我们当根据实际情况，注意不断的发现问题，逐步加以解决。
