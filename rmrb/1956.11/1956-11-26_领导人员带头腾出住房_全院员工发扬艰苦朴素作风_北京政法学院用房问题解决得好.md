    Leadership Personnel Take the Lead in Vacating Housing; All Staff and Workers of the Institute Promote a Spirit of Hard Work and Plain Living
    The Housing Problem at the Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law Is Well Resolved
    (Our newspaper reports) The faculty, staff, and students of the Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law have promoted a spirit of hard work and plain living, actively overcoming the difficulties of insufficient housing. The school administration and Party leaders personally took the lead in vacating their own housing for students to live in.
    The Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law originally had 750 students, and this year the number increased by 500, while the housing area increased very little. According to the quota, the housing area should increase by 12,500 square meters, but in reality, only over 4,000 square meters of school buildings were built, and they are not yet completed. In order to overcome the difficulties of insufficient school teaching and living space, the school leadership attached great importance to solving this problem. The school Party committee first made a mobilization report within the Party, and then made another mobilization report at a general meeting of all faculty, staff, and students, calling on all faculty, staff, and students to promote the spirit of hard work and plain living, tap the potential of the school's housing, rationally adjust teaching and living space, and try to increase the number of beds in the existing housing to maximize the utilization rate of the housing, in order to solve the current difficulties of insufficient housing. Subsequently, the entire institute carried out housing adjustments. All administrative and Party leaders actively promoted a spirit of hard work and plain living, overcoming difficulties. Except for President Qian Duansheng, who did not live at the school, Vice Presidents Liu Jingxi and Li Jinbao, Party Secretary Wang Run, Director of General Affairs Xiu Hengsheng, and other comrades all took the lead in vacating their own housing and moving into offices to live. Under their leadership, many administrative personnel also vacated their own housing. In this way, housing was saved, and a dormitory building of more than 2,400 square meters was vacated for students to live in, solving the students' housing problem. In addition, the school also converted the reading room and meeting room into classrooms, solving the teaching space problem.
    Furthermore: The Beijing Institute of Geology has adjusted its teaching and living space, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient school buildings. The Beijing Institute of Geology has increased by more than 1,700 new students this year, and the housing shortage is severe. In order to ensure students' learning, the school leadership adjusted teaching and living space, moving out some laboratories and some teaching and research offices that did not have fixed equipment; for example, the Physical Education Teaching and Research Office moved into the sheds; in addition, some classrooms were converted into dormitories, so that a part of the teaching space was adjusted as student dormitories, and more than 500 students living in the sheds were moved in. Some rooms were also moved out of the administrative office area, such as the Administrative Management Section, which moved to the gatehouse. The Beijing Institute of Geology adjusted teaching and living space to maximize the utilization rate of the housing.

    领导人员带头腾出住房　全院员工发扬艰苦朴素作风
    北京政法学院用房问题解决得好
    本报讯　北京政法学院师生员工发扬了艰苦朴素的作风，积极克服房屋不足的困难，学校行政和党的领导人亲自带头把自己的住房腾出来让给学生住。
    北京政法学院原有学生七百五十人，今年增加五百人，而房屋面积增加很少。按定额房屋面积应增加一万二千五百平方公尺，但实际只兴建四千多平方公尺的校舍，而且到现在还没有完工。为了克服学校教学和生活用房不足的困难，学校领导上非常重视解决这个问题。学校党委首先在党内做了动员报告，在全院师生员工大会上又做了一次动员报告，号召全院师生员工发扬艰苦朴素的作风，挖掘学校房屋的潜力，合理调整教学和生活用房，尽量在原有住房中增加一些床位，发挥房屋的最大利用率，来解决目前房屋不足的困难。接着，全院就进行了房屋的调整工作。全院行政和党的领导人都积极发扬艰苦朴素作风，克服困难。除院长钱端升未住在学校外，副院长刘镜西、李进宝和党委书记王润，总务主任修恒生等同志都带头将自己的住房腾出来，搬到办公室里去住。在他们的带动下，许多行政人员也都把自己的住房腾了出来。这样，就节省了住房，让出了一幢二千四百多平方公尺的宿舍大楼来给学生住，解决了学生的住房问题。另外，学校还把阅览室和会议室改做教室，解决了教学用房问题。
    又讯：北京地质学院调整了教学和生活用房，克服校舍不足的困难。北京地质学院今年增加了一千七百多名新生，住房差得很多。为了保证学生的学习，学校领导方面对教学和生活用房进行了调整，把没有固定设备的实验室和某些教研室移出一部分，如体育教研室就搬到工棚中去；此外，再把一些教室改作宿舍，这样调整出一部分教学用房作为学生宿舍，把住在工棚里的五百多个学生搬了进来。在行政办公的地方也搬出了一部分房间，如行政管理科就搬到校门口传达室去办公。北京地质学院调整教学和生活用房，尽量发挥了房屋的利用率。
