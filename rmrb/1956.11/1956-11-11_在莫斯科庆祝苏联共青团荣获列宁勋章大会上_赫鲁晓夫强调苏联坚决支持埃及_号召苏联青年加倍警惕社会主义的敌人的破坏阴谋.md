Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch from TASS: The All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union has been awarded the Order of Lenin by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

    The decree issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union stated that the Order of Lenin was awarded in recognition of the great achievements of the Komsomol members and Soviet youth in socialist construction, who have consistently and enthusiastically responded to the calls of the Party and the government, and especially to commend their selfless and effective labor in the work of reclaiming wasteland.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS: A rally was held in Moscow's Lenin Central Stadium Sports Palace on November 8th to celebrate the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League's receipt of its fifth order – the Order of Lenin.

    Leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government, heads of the Komsomol Central Committee, as well as young industrial innovators, youth participating in land reclamation, and representatives of youth participating in harvesting crops in reclamation areas also attended the rally.

    Speakers at the rally expressed the determination of Komsomol members and all Soviet youth: that they must be loyal assistants to the Party in the communist construction of the motherland in the future.

    Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, spoke at the rally.

    Khrushchev first extended congratulations on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the youth and Komsomol members of Moscow, and to the patriotic youth across the country who enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and the government to actively participate in the reclamation of virgin and fallow lands.

    Khrushchev said that the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on awarding the Order of Lenin commended the great achievements of the Komsomol members and Soviet youth in socialist construction, who have consistently and enthusiastically responded to the calls of the Party and the government, and especially commended the selfless and outstanding labor of the Komsomol members and Soviet youth in successfully completing the land reclamation work. The Party and the government hope and firmly believe that the Komsomol will continue to enthusiastically respond to such calls in the future.

    Khrushchev pointed out that in recent years, the Soviet people have achieved great and proud successes in increasing agricultural production, especially in reclaiming wasteland. As a result of land reclamation, our grain output has increased rapidly. We are now able to better solve many pressing problems concerning improving the welfare of the Soviet people, further vigorously developing our country, making the country stronger and more prosperous, and better guaranteeing the needs of workers, peasants, and intellectuals.

    Due to the increase in grain production, we are now able to provide more assistance to countries friendly to us. This is socialist mutual assistance.

    Khrushchev also spoke about the achievements of agricultural workers in developing animal husbandry. He said that we believe that by next year, the supply of milk, meat, and other livestock products to domestic residents will be even better. Market prices for food have also been reduced.

    Khrushchev said that the tasks put forward by the 20th Party Congress in increasing agricultural production will undoubtedly be fully completed and overfulfilled. Magnificent prospects and possibilities are unfolding before us in further improving the people's welfare and accelerating our progress towards communism.

    When talking about the major task put forward by the 20th Party Congress of developing industry in the Siberian region, Khrushchev called on Komsomol members to dedicate their boundless energy to developing Siberia's richest regions, building factories and giant power stations there.

    Khrushchev then said that we must unremittingly strengthen the power of our socialist country and the strength of our heroic Soviet army. Everyone knows that not long ago, the imperialists launched a bandit-like attack on Egypt. The Soviet people and all progressive mankind condemned the imperialist plunderers who attacked the freedom-loving people of Egypt. The voice of the Soviet people supporting Egypt has been valued, first of all because of the power of the Soviet Union, because of the unanimous support of the entire Soviet people for the policies of our Party and the Soviet government, and because of the indivisible friendship of the Soviet Union with all socialist countries. We should support the just struggle of the Egyptian people for independence, and work to get the invading forces to withdraw from Egypt. The Suez Canal rightfully belongs to Egypt, and this country has guaranteed in the past and will guarantee in the future, after the canal is restored, the freedom of navigation on the canal for all relevant countries. We must make unremitting efforts to support Egypt, to make all the uninvited guests roll out of Egyptian territory, to severely punish those war criminals who have brought heavy human sacrifices and economic losses to the Egyptian people, so that the aggressors will no longer be keen on infringing upon others in the future.

    Khrushchev also briefly talked about the recent events in Hungary. He pointed out the great political significance of the struggle of Hungarian socialist forces against counter-revolutionary conspiracies. The suppression of the Hungarian counter-revolution was warmly welcomed by the working people of all socialist countries and progressive people all over the world. He said that everyone knows that the enemies of socialism, in order to undermine the foundations of the people's democratic system, have especially targeted the youth, and they have attempted to deceive the youth with false slogans and lead them astray. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly and unswervingly raise vigilance and pay more attention to giving the youth correct education.

    Khrushchev concluded by saying, comrades! Our work should get better day by day, so as to make our country stronger, so that the Soviet people can live better and more prosperously, and so that our country becomes an impregnable fortress for the enemies.

    在莫斯科庆祝苏联共青团荣获列宁勋章大会上
    赫鲁晓夫强调苏联坚决支持埃及
    号召苏联青年加倍警惕社会主义的敌人的破坏阴谋
    据新华社讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联列宁共产主义青年团荣获了苏联最高苏维埃主席团授予的列宁勋章。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团发布授勋的命令说，鉴于一贯热烈响应党和政府号召的共青团员和苏联青年在社会主义建设中有很大功绩，特别是为了表扬他们在开垦荒地的工作中的忘我的和有成效的劳动，特授予列宁勋章。
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社报道：莫斯科青年11月8日在列宁中央运动场体育宫举行大会，庆祝苏联列宁共产主义青年团荣获第五枚勋章——列宁勋章。
    苏联共产党和政府的领导人、共青团中央的负责人以及青年工业革新者、参加垦荒的青年、参加开垦地区收割庄稼工作的青年代表也出席了大会。
    在大会上发言的人表达了共青团员和全体苏联青年的决心：他们今后在祖国的共产主义建设中一定要做党的忠实的助手。
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫在大会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫首先代表苏联共产党中央委员会向莫斯科的青年和共青团员们祝贺，向热烈响应党和政府的号召、积极参加开垦生荒地和熟荒地的全国爱国青年祝贺。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联最高苏维埃主席团关于授予列宁勋章的命令，表扬了一贯热烈响应党和政府号召的共青团员和苏联青年在社会主义建设方面的巨大功绩，特别表扬了共青团员和苏联青年为胜利完成垦荒工作而进行的忘我的、成绩卓著的劳动。党和政府希望并且也深信：共青团今后仍将热烈地响应这样的号召。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在最近几年，苏联人民在提高农业生产特别是开垦荒地方面取得了足以自豪的巨大成就。由于开荒的结果，我国谷物产量迅速提高了。现在我们已经能够较好地解决许多迫切需要解决的关于增进苏联人民福利，更进一步大力发展我们国家、使国家更加强大和繁荣、更好地保证工人、农民和知识分子的需要的问题。
    由于谷物生产的增加，我们现在有可能更多地援助同我们友好的国家。这就是社会主义的互助。
    赫鲁晓夫还谈到了农业劳动者在发展畜牧业方面取得的成就。他说，我们相信，到明年，供应国内居民牛奶、肉类和其他畜产品的情况将更加好转。食品的市场价格也降低了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，第二十次代表大会在增加农产品生产方面所提出的任务，毫无疑问，将要全部完成和超额完成。在进一步提高人民的福利和加快我们走向共产主义的速度的问题上，我们面前正在展开宏伟的远景和可能性。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到第二十次党代表大会提出的在西伯利亚地区发展工业的重大任务时，号召共青团员到那里去献出无比充沛的精力开拓西伯利亚最富饶的地区，在那里建设工厂和巨型发电站。
    赫鲁晓夫随后说，我们必须毫不放松地加强我们社会主义国家的威力，加强我们英勇的苏军的力量。大家都知道，不久以前帝国主义者向埃及发动了强盗的进攻。苏联人民、全体进步人类痛斥进攻爱好自由的埃及人民的帝国主义掠夺者。苏联人民支持埃及的声音受到重视，这首先是由于苏联的威力，由于全体苏联人民一致支持我们党和苏联政府的政策，由于苏联同所有社会主义国家的不可分割的友谊。我们应该支持埃及人民争取独立的正义斗争，致力于使侵略军撤出埃及。苏伊士运河理应属于埃及，这个国家过去保证了并且将来在运河恢复以后也将保证一切有关国家在运河上的航行自由。我们必须毫不放松地努力支持埃及，使所有的不速之客从埃及国土滚出去，使那些给埃及人民带来惨重的人力牺牲和经济损失的战争祸首受到严惩，使侵略者今后不再醉心于侵犯别人。
    赫鲁晓夫还简要地谈到匈牙利最近的事件。他指出匈牙利社会主义力量对反革命阴谋进行斗争的巨大政治意义。匈牙利反革命的被扑灭，受到一切社会主义国家的劳动人民和全世界进步人士的热烈欢迎。他说，大家知道，社会主义的敌人为了破坏人民民主制度的基础，特别看中了青年，他们企图用虚伪的口号来欺骗青年，把青年引离正路。因此，必须经常不渝地提高警惕性，更多地注意对青年给予正确的教育。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，同志们！我们的工作应该一天比一天好，以便使我国的力量更加强大，使苏联人民生活得更好和更富裕，使我们国家成为敌人不可攻破的堡垒。
