Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 22nd - In the first ten months of this year, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed on the Fujian Front have already saved over 828,000 jin of rice and over 1,821,000 jin of firewood.

The cooks of the Fujian Front troops, based on the characteristics of the troops, have summarized some methods of cooking that save rice and firewood. Hu Bingyuan, a cook of the "Dachen Island Company" known by the soldiers as a "cooking expert," has cooked more than 2,000 pots of rice without a single instance of undercooked or burnt rice. Moreover, the rice yield is high, and it does not form a thick crust. Troops using his method of cooking have reduced the average daily rice consumption per person by two to four liang compared to the standard, with one company, the Sixth Company of a certain unit, saving six liang per person per day.

Under the unified leadership of the logistics departments, the troops also renovated the firewood-consuming stoves and assigned special personnel to burn the fire, ensuring even firewood addition and thorough burning, which greatly reduced firewood consumption. Hu Bingyuan only burns four jin of firewood to cook a pot of forty jin of rice, a reduction of about ten jin compared to the past. The Sixth Company of a certain regiment reduced its firewood consumption by 60% compared to the standard.

In order to promote advanced experience, the troops have held several "Cooking Work Symposia" and "Food Exhibitions" since the beginning of spring this year. The logistics department of the Fujian Front troops' leading organs also published a 40,000-word "Selected Compilation of Food Improvement Experiences."

    福建前线部队的做饭能手
    十个月节约大米八十二万多斤木柴一百八十万斤
    新华社福建前线22日电　中国人民解放军驻福建前线部队在今年头十个月中，已经节省大米八十二万八千多斤，木柴一百八十二万一千多斤。
    福建前线各部队的炊事兵们，根据部队特点，总结出一些节省大米和木柴的做饭方法。被官兵们称为“做饭能手”的“大陈岛连”炊事兵胡炳元，他做过两千多锅饭，没有发生一次夹生或烧焦的现象，而且出饭多，不长锅巴。采用他的方法做饭的部队，每人每天平均用米量比标准降低二两到四两，某部六连每人每天节省到六两。
    各部队还在后勤部门统一领导下，改建了费柴火的炉灶，同时指定专人烧火，作到了加柴均匀，木柴烧透，使木柴消耗量大大减少。胡炳元煮一锅四十斤米的饭，只烧四斤木柴，比过去减少了十来斤。某团六连烧柴量比标准降低了60％。
    各部队为了推广先进经验，今年入春以来分别召开了多次“炊事工作座谈会”和“伙食展览会”。福建前线部队领导机关的后勤部门还出版了一本四万字的“伙食改善经验选编”。
