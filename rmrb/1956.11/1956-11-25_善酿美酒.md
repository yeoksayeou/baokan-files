Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 24th: "Shan Niang" wine, the true representative of Shaoxing's famous wine, has resumed production. Thirteen years ago, the Shen Yonghe Winery, the sole producer of this fine wine, was ravaged by the Japanese invaders, and the factory owner was unable to restore production, causing this fine wine to disappear from the market.

This August, the Shaoxing Municipal Industrial and Commercial leadership department, responding to the demands of the masses, began to restore production of this fine wine. They merged several small wineries in the city, added some new factory buildings, and found old winemaking technicians who had worked in the Shen Yonghe Winery to re-establish the Shen Yonghe Winery. Currently, the four winemaking workshops of the Shen Yonghe Winery have officially begun production.

    善酿美酒
    新华社杭州24日电　绍兴名酒的真正代表——“善酿”酒恢复生产。十三年前，独家出产这种美酒的沈永和酒厂由于受到了日寇的洗劫，厂主无力恢复生产，这一美酒曾在市场上绝迹。
    今年8月间，绍兴市工商领导部门接受了群众的要求，着手恢复这种美酒的生产。他们合并了市内几家小酒厂，添造了一些新的厂房，并且找到了原在沈永和酒厂工作过的制酒老技工，重新建立了沈永和酒厂。现在，沈永和酒厂的四个制酒车间已经正式投入生产。
