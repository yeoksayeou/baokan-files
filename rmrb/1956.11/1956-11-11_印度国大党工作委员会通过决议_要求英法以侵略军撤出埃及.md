Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 10th - The Indian National Congress Working Committee, in a resolution passed on November 9th, stated that there could be no peace "until all the aggressive armies withdraw from Egyptian territory and Egyptian sovereignty is fully restored."

The resolution expressed "great indignation and dissatisfaction at Israel's invasion of Egypt and the armed action taken against Egypt by the United Kingdom and France to force Egypt to submit to their will."

The resolution hoped that the United Nations General Assembly's directive on a ceasefire and demanding that the aggressor nations withdraw their armed forces from Egyptian territory would be realized in the near future.

This resolution on "International Affairs" was published in draft form and will be submitted to the Indian National Congress National Committee meeting in Calcutta on November 11th for approval.

The resolution said: "The Indian National Congress National Committee is gravely concerned about recent developments in international affairs. Old and shameful colonial methods have been restored internationally, armed intervention has been carried out in Egypt, and invasion, aggression, and even bombing have been used to force political and other decisions. This has brought the world to the brink of a major war."

The resolution said: "A particularly unfortunate aspect of this situation is the way in which the will proclaimed by the United Nations has been disregarded."

The resolution said: "The Indian National Congress National Committee expresses its deep sympathy to the people of Egypt who have experienced such great suffering, and expresses its approval of the calm manner in which the people of Cairo have remained despite the bombing."

The resolution also addressed the committee's views on the Hungarian issue, advocating "the withdrawal of foreign troops from Hungary, and that the Hungarian people should determine their own future by peaceful means."

The resolution said: "The Indian National Congress National Committee hopes that Asian and African countries, in particular, should cooperate for their security and progress in the spirit of the Bandung Conference, and should strive to extend this spirit of coexistence and cooperation to other parts of the world."

    印度国大党工作委员会通过决议
    要求英法以侵略军撤出埃及
    新华社新德里10日电　印度国大党工作委员会在11月9日通过的一项决议中说，“在所有的侵略军队撤离埃及领土和埃及的主权完全恢复以前”，不可能有和平。
    决议对“以色列侵犯埃及和联合王国同法国为了强迫埃及顺从他们的意志而对埃及采取武装行动表示非常愤慨和不满”。
    决议希望联合国大会关于停火和要求侵略国家从埃及领土撤退它们的武装力量的指令在不久将来就会实现。
    这项关于“国际事务”的决议是以草案的形式发表的，它将被提交11月11日在加尔各答举行的印度国大党全国委员会会议批准。
    决议说：“印度国大党全国委员会严重地关切国际事务最近的发展。在国际上已经恢复了陈旧的可耻的殖民方法，对埃及实行武装干涉，还用侵犯、侵略，甚至轰炸来强迫实行政治的和其他的决定。这已经把世界引向了大战的边缘。”
    决议说：“这种局势中特别令人感到不幸的一点是联合国所宣扬的意愿遭到轻视的那种方式。”
    决议说：“印度国大党全国委员会对经历了如此巨大的苦难的埃及人民表示深切的同情，并且对开罗人民不顾轰炸而保持镇静的举止表示赞许。”
    决议中也谈到委员会对匈牙利问题的意见，它主张“在匈牙利的外国军队撤退，并且，匈牙利人民要用和平方法，来决定他们自己的前途。”
    决议说：“印度国大党全国委员会希望亚非国家特别应该在万隆会议的精神下为了它们的安全和进步共同合作，并且应该努力把这种共处和合作的精神推广到世界的其他部分去。”
