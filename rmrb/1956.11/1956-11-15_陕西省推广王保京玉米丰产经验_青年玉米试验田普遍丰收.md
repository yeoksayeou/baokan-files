Shaanxi Province Promotes Wang Baojing's Experience in High Corn Yields
    Youth Corn Experimental Fields Achieve Widespread Bumper Harvests
    (Our report) In over fifty agricultural cooperatives in Liquan, Ankang, Yijun, Fengxiang, Shangnan, Fu County, Huanglong, Chaoyi, Chunhua, and the suburbs of Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, the youth production teams and planting groups' corn experimental fields promoted Wang Baojing's experience in high yields, achieving widespread bumper harvests with an average yield of over 1,300 jin per mu. Among them, the experimental field of the youth production team of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative, led by Wang Baojing, yielded over 2,070 jin of corn per mu. The corn experimental field of the Zao Ping Cooperative in Chunhua County exceeded the yield of the Fenghuo Cooperative, reaching as high as 2,294 jin per mu.
    This spring, when Wang Baojing's experience in high corn yields began to be promoted, many people did not believe it. They said, "Natural conditions are different; the Fenghuo Cooperative has good soil and irrigated land, so corn yields are high." Some said, "Achieving high yields on 1.8 mu is possible, but it won't work on a large scale." The facts shattered these people's thoughts and statements. This year, the fifty-plus small-area youth corn experimental fields in Shaanxi Province were widely distributed and had different natural conditions, yet they all achieved bumper harvests. The Taian Agricultural Cooperative in Fu County is located on a dry plateau. When the cooperative's youth production team proposed to learn from Wang Baojing and create 1,000-jin corn high-yield fields, some people said, "Wang Baojing's high-yield land is irrigated land in the Qinchuan Plain, while we have narrow gullies and small rivers here. How can we compare?" The youth team did not lose heart. They conscientiously implemented Wang Baojing's measures for high corn yields, resulting in a corn yield of over 1,300 jin per mu in this experimental field. Last year, this land yielded 150 jin of corn per mu, exceeding last year's yield by over nine times.
    The results of large-scale corn high-yields at the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative also proved that the claim that large-scale application wouldn't work was incorrect. The Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative has already harvested 455 mu of corn, with an average yield of 822 jin per mu, of which 121 mu yielded over 1,000 jin per mu. The yield of these 455 mu of corn, plus this year's summer wheat yield (an average of 320 jin of wheat per mu), averages 1,142 jin of grain per mu. (Zhu Bo)

### 陕西省推广王保京玉米丰产经验  青年玉米试验田普遍丰收

    陕西省推广王保京玉米丰产经验
    青年玉米试验田普遍丰收
    本报讯　陕西省醴泉、安康、宜君、凤翔、商南、鄜县、黄龙、朝邑、淳化、西安市郊等地五十多个农业社的青年生产队和种植组的玉米试验田推广王保京丰产经验，普遍获得丰收，平均亩产在一千三百斤以上。其中王保京领导的烽火农业社青年生产队的试验田，亩产玉米二千零七十多斤；淳化县枣萍社玉米试验田的产量超过烽火社的收成，亩产竟达二千二百九十四斤。
    今春当王保京的玉米丰产经验开始推广的时候，很多人不相信。他们说：“自然条件不同，烽火社土质好，又是水浇地，玉米才丰产了。”有的说：“在一亩八分地上搞丰产行，大面积就行不通了。”事实打破了这些人的想法和说法，今年陕西省五十多块小面积青年玉米试验田分布面很广，自然条件又各不相同，却同样获得丰收。鄜县太安农业社位于干旱的高原上，当该社青年生产队提出要向王保京学习，搞千斤玉米丰产田的时候，有些人就说：“王保京的丰产地是秦川的水浇田，咱们这里是窄沟狭川，怎么能和人家比？”青年队并没有泄气，他们认真实行了王保京玉米丰产的各项措施，使得这块试验田的玉米亩产达到一千三百余斤，去年这块地亩产玉米一百五十斤，比去年产量超过九倍。
    烽火农业社大面积玉米丰产的结果，也证明大面积行不通的说法是错误的。烽火农业社已经收获的四百五十五亩玉米，平均亩产八百二十二斤，其中有一百二十一亩，亩产千斤以上，这四百五十五亩玉米产量再加上今年夏季小麦产量（平均每亩收小麦三百二十斤），每亩平均收一千一百四十二斤粮食。（朱波）
