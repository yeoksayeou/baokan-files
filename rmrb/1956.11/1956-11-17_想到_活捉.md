Thinking of "Capturing Alive"
　　Fuxian
　　Seeing the discussion in the newspaper about whether ghosts can appear in classical dramas, I also thought of several ghost operas I had seen before.
　　Some time ago, the Wuhan Han Opera Theatre organized several veteran artists to perform a batch of traditional repertoires. The 74-year-old famous clown Da Heshang (Li Chunsen) also appeared on stage, but his most brilliant "Capturing Alive" was not performed, which greatly disappointed me.
　　Mei Lanfang mentioned Yang San (Mingyu), a Kunqu opera clown, who performed the "Capturing Alive" with "superb skills" in his "Forty Years of Stage Life." I was born late and didn't get to see Yang San's "Zhang San"; Da Heshang's "Zhang San" I have seen, although I don't know how it compares to Yang San, in my opinion, it can also be called "superb skills." I also remember seeing Kunqu and Shaoxing High Opera troupes performing "Capturing Alive" twenty or thirty years ago. The actors also had very good skills. They were as light as paper, and as ghostly as ghosts (although I have never seen ghosts). The wonderful thing about this was roughly similar to Da Heshang, and also similar to Yang San as described by Mei Lanfang. In general, actors without solid skills cannot perform such a play. Forcing it will only become an ugly and terrifying haunting, which will only make people disgusted. In Shaoxing, in the past, they would eat sugarcane tips – the audience would throw the remaining sugarcane tips onto the stage to "criticize" him.
　　When watching this play, people generally only pay attention to the technique and don't care about its content, but it's not entirely like that.
　　I remember when I was a child, when watching "Capturing Alive," besides appreciating those solid skills, I also thought about the content and had doubts. At that time, I thought that Yan Poxi wanted to capture Zhang San alive in order to avenge her death. This was strange: the enemy who killed her was Song Jiang, so why did she come to Zhang San for his life? Because I couldn't understand the lyrics at all, I had to answer this question myself: Poxi thought that if Zhang San hadn't seduced her, she wouldn't have been killed by Song Jiang; therefore, although she died at the hands of Song Jiang, the disaster actually started with Zhang San, and Zhang San was the chief culprit, so revenge should be sought from him. This was a very moralistic view, and at the time, I thought it was very profound.
　　Later, after reading the lyrics of "Capturing Alive" in "Zhui Bai Qiu," I realized that Poxi was not seeking revenge, but was deeply in love with Zhang San. Even as a ghost, she couldn't let him go. "Truly, the silkworm's silk is not exhausted until death." So, she captures her beloved Sanlang alive, "to fly together, and enter the underworld together." It turns out that the playwright is telling us: love is stronger than death!
　　In this way, my interest in this play became deeper.
　　The belief in ghosts, or rather the hope for ghosts, among people in the old society was caused by various social conditions. One of them was the wish of the oppressed. The oppressed people originally believed that "a bad life is better than a good death"; but when they were oppressed to the point where they really couldn't live, they hoped that they could still be ghosts after death, either to take revenge or to live in the ghost world. Like Yan Poxi, she was looking for her Sanlang to continue their love life together in the ghost world. Even revenge is a kind of life. From this, we can see that there were two motivations for suicide at that time. One was simply to seek death and escape the suffering of the present world, which was completely passive. Another was to seek life in another world, in another way; this mood was tragic, but also heroic.
　　From this point of view, the famous saying of the 17th-century French thinker La Bruyère does not apply to our oppressed people in the past. He said: "Man has only three great events: birth, life, and death. He does not think of birth, he is troubled by death, and he forgets life." Our oppressed people in the past did not forget life until death, seeking death for the sake of living, and hoping to live after death. From here, from superstition, we see the people's ardent love for life, and at the same time, we see the cruelty of the old social system to the people.
　　In the new society, superstition still remains among the people, and superstition must be eliminated, and it must be eliminated through scientific propaganda. Naturally, literature and art also have the task of eliminating superstition. However, now, the social conditions that made people hope to be ghosts to continue living have been completely eliminated. Therefore, plays like "Capturing Alive," performed by actors like Da Heshang, with slight reforms, occasionally performed, and with explanations, so that people can appreciate its unique techniques and understand the pain of the people's situation in the old society and their ardent love for life, I think is acceptable. Perhaps it will also be beneficial, making people, in contrast, enhance their love for the new society.
　　As for the places that need to be slightly reformed, first, the lyrics should be compiled in a more popular way; second, the "face-changing" techniques that try to win with terror but only look ugly should be appropriately deleted. – In old performances, that kind of overly terrifying image is contradictory to the content of the play "Capturing Alive."

### 想到“活捉”

    想到“活捉”
    弗先
    看到报纸上关于古典戏剧里可不可以出鬼的讨论，我也想到了从前看过的几出鬼戏。
    前些时，武汉市汉剧院组织了好几位老艺人，演出了一批传统剧目，七十四岁的名丑大和尚（李春森）也上台了，但他的最精采的“活捉”，却没有演出，这使我大为失望。
    梅兰芳在“舞台生活四十年”中，讲到了昆丑杨三（鸣玉）演“活捉”的“绝艺”。我生得晚，没有赶上看到杨三的“张三”；大和尚演的“张三”，则是看过的，虽不知比杨三如何，在我看来，也称得起是“绝艺”了。我还记得，二、三十年前，看过昆班和绍兴的高腔班演“活捉”，演员们也有很好的功夫；他们在身轻如纸，活像幽灵（虽然我并没有见过幽灵）这一点上，妙处大致同大和尚相似，也同梅兰芳所形容的杨三相似。大凡这样的戏，没有一点硬功夫的演员是不能演出的，勉强演来，只会成为丑陋不堪的闹鬼，反而使人生厌了，那在绍兴，从前是要吃甘蔗梢头的——台下的观众会拿吃甘蔗所剩的末梢丢到台上去“批评”他。
    看这戏，一般人们是只注意技术，而不去管它的内容的，然而，也不完全是这样。
    我记得小时候看“活捉”，除了欣赏那些硬功夫，也曾对内容想过一下，从而发生过疑问。那时候，我以为阎婆惜要活捉张三，是为了索命报仇。这就奇怪了：杀她的仇人是宋江，她为什么来索张三的命呢？因为完全听不懂唱词，所以对这疑问，只好自己作了答案：婆惜以为，张三如不来勾引她，她就不至于被宋江杀死；所以，身虽死于宋江，而祸实起于张三，张三才是恶魁祸首，报仇就要向他索命。这是一个很富于道学气的见解，当时自以为很深刻。
    后来读了“缀白裘”里的“活捉”的曲文，这才知道，婆惜不是为的索命报仇，却是为了热恋张三，做了鬼都舍不下，“真个是，春蚕丝，到死未尽”，所以活捉她的心爱的三郎，“效于飞，双双入冥”去的。原来剧作者在告诉我们：爱情比死更坚强呵！
    这样一来，我对这戏的兴趣更深浓了。
    旧社会的人们之相信有鬼，或者说希望有鬼，是由种种社会条件造成的。其中之一，是被压迫者的愿望。被压迫的人民，本来也是认为“好死不如恶活”的；但到被压迫得实在活不下去了的时候，那就希望死后还能做鬼，或者为了可以复仇，或者为了在鬼世界里还能生活。像阎婆惜，就是找她的三郎到鬼世界里去共同继续其恋爱生活的。就是报仇，也是一种生活。由此可知，那时候的自杀者也有两种动机。一是单纯的寻死，脱离现世的苦境，那是完全消极的了。又一种，则是到另一世界，另一方式下去寻生活；这心情是悲惨的，但也是壮烈的。
    这样看来，十七世纪法国思想家拉·勃吕耶尔的那句名言，并不适用于我们过去被压迫的人民了，他说：“人只有三件大事：生、活和死。他不想到生，他苦恼于死，而他忘掉了活。”我们过去的被压迫的人民，则到死不忘活，求死为了活，并且希望死后还要活。从这里，我们从迷信中，看到了人民对生活的热恋，同时也看到旧社会制度对人民的残酷。
    在新社会，人民中间还残存着迷信，迷信必须加以破除，而且必须依靠科学的宣传来进行破除。自然，文艺也有破除迷信的任务。但是，现在，使人希望做鬼以继续生活的社会条件，已经完全消灭了。所以，像“活捉”这样的戏，由大和尚这样的演员，略加改革，间或演出，并附说明，使人们能够欣赏其中特有的技术，并了解旧社会人民的处境的痛苦和对生活的热恋，我以为是可以的。也许还会有益，使人们在对比之下，增强对新社会的热爱。
    至于，须要略加改革的地方，第一，是唱词要编得通俗些；第二，那些想以恐怖取胜却只见得丑恶的“变脸”的技术，应该有适当的删削。——在旧时的演出中，那种过于恐怖的形象，与“活捉”这戏的内容，是矛盾的。
