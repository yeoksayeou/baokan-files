About Mr. Sun Yat-sen

Li Langru (oral account), Chen Xinxian (recorder)

I followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen from 1913, for a total of more than eleven years. I served as his bodyguard adjutant and bodyguard captain, and secretary, often at his side, personally hearing his many instructions, which I will never forget in my life.

"Failure is the mother of success" - this is what Mr. Sun Yat-sen often said. He often used this sentence to encourage himself and exhort his comrades. In 1922, the National Revolutionary Army set out on the Northern Expedition, but it failed due to Chen Jiongming's rebellion in Guangzhou. I went to Shanghai to report the failure to Mr. Sun Yat-sen. He firmly said to me: "'Failure is the mother of success.' Although this time we failed, with the experience of this failure, next time success will be more hopeful." Mr. Sun Yat-sen's indomitable will and revolutionary optimism will never be forgotten by me.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen hated corruption the most. He was very amiable to comrades, subordinates, and the people, and rarely spoke harshly. However, he showed no mercy to corrupt people. When Chen Jiongming rebelled, Yunnan army general Yang Ximin led troops into Guangdong, using the pretext of quelling the rebellion to take the opportunity to engage in large-scale corruption. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was very angry when he learned of this. Once, when Yang Ximin came to see Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Mr. Sun Yat-sen severely reprimanded Yang Ximin on the spot. He said, "As a revolutionary soldier, you are corrupting the people's property and lining your own pockets. How can you be worthy of the people and the country!" Yang Ximin was so ashamed that he lowered his head and stood there without daring to move.

People know that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was frugal and studious. I particularly remember one thing: In 1917, when Mr. Sun Yat-sen was the Grand Marshal, although he was very busy every day, he still read whenever he had time, often sitting alone on a wooden chair reading late into the night. Because that wooden chair was hard and the back was too low, making it very uncomfortable to sit on, the logistics department planned to make a custom-made sofa chair for him. When he found out, he immediately asked me to notify the logistics department not to buy a sofa chair. He said, "Sofa chairs are very expensive, don't buy them. If you have to, buy a high-backed rattan chair, which is cheaper, lighter, and more comfortable." As a result, the logistics department had to return the sofa chair and buy him a rattan chair.

"Alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers" was Mr. Sun Yat-sen's firm political policy in his later years. He often said, "Britain and the United States are only interested in profit and know only how to plunder our country's wealth. Only Russia is sincerely helping our revolution. We must ally with Russia and learn from Russia." He once asked Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, Li Zhangda and a few others, including me, to learn Russian, so that we could prepare to study in Russia. At that time, Liao was in charge of finance, Zhu was the commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Army, and I was a staff officer. We were relatively busy with our work and could not learn Russian, but only Li Zhangda learned it. Later, Mr. Sun Yat-sen sent Li Zhangda to study in Russia.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen admired Lenin very much. In 1924, when he heard the news of Lenin's death in Guangzhou, he was very grieved. On the day of the memorial service, he reported Lenin's life and deeds at the meeting, saying that Lenin was a great revolutionary, and instructed everyone to learn from Lenin and learn from Russia.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen firmly advocated cooperation with the Communist Party, which was opposed by some reactionaries within the Kuomintang at that time. Feng Ziyou was one of the most rampant. Once, Feng Ziyou openly slandered the Communist Party at a meeting. Mr. Sun Yat-sen severely reprimanded him and ordered Feng Ziyou not to see him again in the future.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen has been gone for more than thirty years, but his great spirit of engaging in revolution throughout his life and these deeds will always remain in our hearts.

    关于孙中山先生的几件事
    李朗如口述　陈信贤记
    我从1913年起追随孙中山先生，总共有十一年多。我先后做过他的保卫参军兼保卫队长和秘书等职务，经常在他的身边，亲聆他许多训诲，使我终生不忘。
    “失败是成功之母”——这句话是中山先生经常说的。他经常拿这句话来鼓励自己，勖勉同志。1922年，国民革命军出师北伐，因为陈炯明在广州叛变，以致失败。我到上海把失败的情况向中山先生报告，他坚定地对我说：“‘失败是成功之母’这次虽然失败了，可是有了这失败的经验，下次成功就更有希望了。”中山先生的这种不屈不挠的意志和革命乐观精神，使我永远忘不了。
    中山先生最痛恨贪污的人。他对同志、部属、人民群众都很和蔼可亲，从来很少疾言厉色。但是，对于贪污的人毫不留情。当陈炯明叛变的时候，滇军将领杨希闵领兵入粤，借名平乱，乘机大肆贪污。中山先生知道这件事之后，非常气愤。有一次，杨希闵来见中山先生，中山先生当场把杨希闵严厉地申斥了一顿。他说：“你身为革命军人，却贪污人民财产，中饱私囊，你怎样对得住人民、国家！”骂得杨希闵惭愧低头，站着不敢动弹。
    人们都知道中山先生俭朴、勤学。我特别记得一件事情：1917年，中山先生任大元帅的时候，虽然每天很忙，但是仍然一有空就读书，经常独坐在一张木椅上读到深夜。因为那张木椅硬，椅背太低，坐得很不舒服，庶务计划给他定制一张沙发椅。他知道了，就立即叫我通知庶务不要买沙发椅。他说：“沙发椅价钱很贵，不要买它，要就买一张高背藤椅吧，既省钱，又轻便、舒适。”结果，庶务只好退掉沙发椅，给他买回一张藤椅。
    “联俄、联共、扶助农工”，是中山先生晚年坚定不移的政治方针。他经常说：“英、美唯利是图，只知抢掠我国的财富，只有俄国才真心帮助我们革命，我们一定要联俄，并且以俄为师。”他曾经叫廖仲恺、朱执信、李章达和我等几个人学习俄文，要我们准备去俄国学习。当时，廖负责财政，朱任革命军总司令，我做参谋，工作比较忙，学不成俄文，只有李章达学成。后来，中山先生就派李章达去俄国学习。
    中山先生对列宁很敬仰。1924年他在广州听到列宁逝世的消息，非常痛切。开追悼会那一天，他在会上报告了列宁的生平事迹，说列宁是伟大的革命家，嘱大家要学习列宁，学习俄国。
    中山先生坚决主张和共产党合作，曾经受到当时国民党内的一些反动派反对，冯自由是其中最猖獗的一个。有一次，冯自由在会上公开诋毁共产党，中山先生狠狠地教训了他一顿，并且令冯自由以后不要去见他。
    中山先生离开我们三十多年了，可是他毕生从事革命的伟大精神和这些事迹，却永远留在我们的心里。
