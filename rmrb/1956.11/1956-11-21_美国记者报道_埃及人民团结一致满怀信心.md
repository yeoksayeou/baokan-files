Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 20th: The Egyptian people across the country are now united and full of confidence.

An Associated Press reporter, upon returning to Egypt recently after a month's absence, was first struck by the fact that "the Anglo-French attack on Egypt has not left a single visible scar on the strength of President Nasser's domestic front." The reporter said, "Egypt still appears confident, well-disciplined, and calm. Moreover, every Egyptian is still shouting that familiar slogan: 'Long live Gamal (Nasser)'."

Egypt has carried out rapid repairs to the airport runways, and the scars of the bombing are quickly disappearing. The airport staff showed the same enthusiasm and friendly attitude as in the past.

The report also said that the general mood of the Egyptian residents seemed to be that of victors. They are proud of the discipline they showed during the air raids and the effective blackout implemented in Cairo at that time. Almost every house is plastered with propaganda posters depicting an Egyptian boot trampling on attacking British, French, and Israelis, calling on the people to overthrow the invaders.

    美国记者报道
    埃及人民团结一致满怀信心
    新华社20日讯　开罗消息：埃及全国人民现在正团结一致，满怀信心。
    一个美联社记者在离开一个月以后在最近重新回到埃及时所得到第一个印象是：“英法对埃及的攻击没有在纳赛尔总统的国内战线的力量上遗留下一点看得见的伤痕。”记者说，“埃及看来仍然是满怀信心，纪律良好，平静无事。而且，每一个埃及人仍然喊着这样熟悉的口号：‘加麦尔（纳赛尔）万岁’”。
    埃及对飞机场的跑道进行了迅速的整修工作，使得遭受轰炸的创痕正在很快地消失。飞机场的工作人员表现了和过去一样的热情和友好的态度。
    这篇报道还说，埃及居民的一般情绪显得就是胜利者一样。他们对于自己在空袭时所表现的守纪律的精神以及开罗在这种时候所实行的有效的灯火管制感到骄傲。差不多每一幢房屋上都贴着画着一只埃及皮靴踩着进攻的英国人、法国人和以色列人的宣传画，号召人民打倒侵略者。
