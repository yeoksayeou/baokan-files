    Peasant Service Department

    The current rural free market must not be a free market that is detached from state leadership and completely unmanaged; opening up the rural free market is by no means restoring the old-style capitalist free trade.

    The problem now is how to lead it. This leadership should not be interfering with peasant trade, but rather guiding it according to circumstances, helping it to take the right path, and preventing it from going astray.

    Helping includes persuasion and education, as well as necessary organizational work. The Peasant Service Department is an appropriate form of organizing peasant trade. The Peasant Service Department can organize the original brokers in the rural market, utilize their strengths to serve the peasants; appropriately arrange various trading activities and prices; make it convenient for both buyers and sellers; combine peasant trade with the trade of supply and marketing cooperatives; and appropriately regulate supply and demand.

    What specific organizational forms and working systems are best for the Peasant Service Department still lacks sufficient experience, and we hope that comrades in various regions will pay attention to investigation and research. We hope to publish more good experiences in this regard.

    农民服务部
    目前的农村自由市场，决不能是脱离国家领导的、根本没人管理的自由市场；开放农村自由市场，决不是恢复旧式的资本主义的自由贸易。
    现在的问题是怎样领导它。这种领导，不是对农民贸易横加干涉，而应当是对它因势利导，好好地帮助它走正路，防止它走歪路。
    帮助，包括说服教育，也包括必要的组织工作。农民服务部正是组织农民贸易的一种适当的形式。农民服务部可以把农村市场上原有的经纪人组织起来，利用他们的特长为农民服务；可以把各方面的交易活动和价格作适当地安排；可以使买卖双方都感到便利；可以使农民贸易和供销社的贸易结合起来；可以适当地调剂供求关系。
    农民服务部的具体组织形式和工作制度究竟怎样好，现在还缺乏足够的经验，希望各地的同志们注意调查研究。我们希望能更多地发表这方面的好经验。
