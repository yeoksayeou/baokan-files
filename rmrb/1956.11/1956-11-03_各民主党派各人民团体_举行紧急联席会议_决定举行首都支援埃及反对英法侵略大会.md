Xinhua News Agency, 2nd - Leaders of various democratic parties and people's organizations held an emergency joint meeting tonight to discuss organizing people from all walks of life nationwide to support Egypt in its war against Anglo-French aggression. The meeting unanimously approved the suggestion to hold a mass rally in the capital on November 3rd to support Egypt and oppose Anglo-French aggression.

The joint meeting was convened by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace.

The chairman of the meeting, Chen Shutong, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said at the beginning of the meeting that Britain and France have now openly invaded Egypt, threatening the Asian-African region and world peace. The actions of British and French imperialism have aroused the indignation of people all over the world.

Chen Shutong said that the Chinese government has already issued a statement, and we fully support this statement. Our democratic parties and people's organizations should take action, call on the people of the whole country to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people, and protest against the Anglo-French war of aggression.

Chen Shutong said that the people of the capital have been extraordinarily excited these days. On behalf of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, I propose that a mass rally attended by people from all walks of life be held on November 3rd to support Egypt and resist Anglo-French aggression.

Liu Ningyi, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Liao Chengzhi, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting successively. They said that the war of aggression launched by Britain and France has shocked the people of the world. All of us in China should take action to support the Egyptian people, which is necessary for the Egyptian people, the people of the Near and Middle East, and the people of anti-colonialist countries all over the world.

Li Jishen, chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, suggested in his speech that the protest letter against Anglo-French aggression against Egypt, which will be adopted at the mass rally to be held on November 3rd, should be sent to the parliaments of various countries and the United Nations, calling on the people of all countries to act in unison to stop the Anglo-French imperialist war of aggression.

Huang Yanpei, director of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said in his speech that the China Democratic National Construction Association is about to hold the Second Plenary Session of the First Congress. The members attending the meeting, like the people of the whole country, are very indignant at the war of aggression against Egypt launched by Britain and France. We resolutely oppose the Anglo-French war of aggression and resolutely support the Egyptian people's war of resistance against aggression.
