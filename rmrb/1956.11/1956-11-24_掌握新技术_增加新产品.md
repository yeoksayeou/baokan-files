Master New Technologies, Increase New Products

    New Diesel Engine
    China's first major new product of the First Five-Year Plan, a 600-horsepower large marine diesel engine, has been successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai Joint State-Private New China Power Machinery Factory. Starting from September 28th, this diesel engine underwent 192 hours of test runs and other characteristic tests. Not only did the no-load operation perform well, but the operation was also normal during the 660-horsepower overload test.
    This diesel engine is currently the largest horsepower diesel engine manufactured in China. It was independently tested and designed by Chinese technicians based on a new type of diesel engine manufactured in Czechoslovakia and other relevant data. Compared with the 250-horsepower diesel engine currently produced by the New China Power Machinery Factory, this new type of diesel engine has an average weight reduction of eight kilograms per horsepower and also saves more fuel than the 250-horsepower diesel engine. This diesel engine is flexible to operate, making it suitable for use on ships. In addition, with slight design modifications, this diesel engine can also be used as power equipment for onshore power generation or mining machinery; the horsepower can be increased to 675 horsepower.

    Nickel-Free Aluminum-Iron Magnetic Steel
    Dai Wenzhou and other technicians from the Shanghai Joint State-Private Jiangnan Electrical Equipment Factory have recently successfully trial-produced a type of aluminum-iron magnetic steel that uses absolutely no nickel.
    Magnetic steel is a material with a wide range of uses in the telecommunications and electrical industries. It is needed in the heads of loudspeakers, the earpieces of telephone receivers, and many types of instruments. The manufacture of high-quality magnetic steel requires a significant amount of nickel. Nickel is a rare and precious metal in China, but many important industrial products must use it. Due to the lack of nickel, the production of magnetic steel at the Jiangnan Electrical Equipment Factory has been seriously affected.
    The Jiangnan Electrical Equipment Factory's trial production of aluminum-iron magnetic steel was successful after more than 100 explorations and experiments, mastering the technology of adding carbon to the magnetic steel and quenching the magnetic steel. After testing by the Central Broadcasting Bureau, the reed loudspeakers assembled with this magnetic steel, apart from being slightly larger in volume, have a sound quality no less than that of aluminum-nickel-iron magnetic steel. Using this magnetic steel to manufacture reed loudspeaker heads can save nearly ten tons of nickel per year in Shanghai alone.
    The factory is now actively preparing for production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Automatic Power Controller
    An automatic power controller that can automatically adjust the power of lathes has recently been successfully tested at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory. Test results have proved that this equipment can save a large amount of electricity. All lathes with fluctuating loads can use this controller.
    The automatic power controller was successfully tested by Zhang Weilie, an eighth-grade technician at the factory. He added a current load maintainer and an auxiliary contact controlled by a suction gate to a lathe. This device can automatically adjust the power load according to the number of revolutions and the amount of cut made by the lathe. This avoids the power consumption caused by the frequent use of high power in the past.
    Zhang Weilie is an electrician in the first processing workshop of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory. He began studying this device in August of this year. With the help of engineers from the Taiyuan Power Supply Bureau, he successively drew more than 20 sketches and went through many trials.
    Currently, technicians from the Taiyuan Power Supply Bureau are further studying this device. They say that this device will be recommended to relevant industrial departments nationwide. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Highly Productive Automatic Machine
    The Shanghai Joint State-Private Mingtai Machinery Iron Factory, with the assistance of the Dalong Machinery Factory and the Zhongyuan Motor Factory, has recently successfully trial-produced a high-pressure oil pump powder coating automatic machine.
    The high-pressure oil pump powder coating automatic machine is very efficient, capable of producing seven high-quality welding rods in one second.
    After trial use by the Shanghai Welding Rod Factory, the output is more than double that of the previous spiral lathes, while the number of operating workers has been reduced by half. Moreover, high-quality welding rods can be made using domestically produced medicinal powder (the raw material for coating welding rods), reducing the cost of welding rod production by about 30%. Based on the output of this machine alone, it can save the country 150,000 yuan in foreign exchange each year. (Qian Yanjun)

    What Big Trucks!
    The Qiqihar Railway Vehicle Manufacturing Plant has recently manufactured a batch of new types of freight cars. Among them, one type is a 60-ton low-side gondola for coal; the other is a 60-ton all-steel heavy-duty freight car.
    Because these two types of freight cars are made entirely of steel, they are durable and can carry twice the load of China's existing 30-ton freight cars.
    All-steel heavy-duty freight cars are used to transport heavy equipment produced domestically and abroad. They can be loaded and transported in complete sets or individual pieces, preventing heavy equipment from being dismantled too much and increasing the workload of equipment installation. At the same time, equipment is easier to maintain during transport. Low-side gondolas not only carry more coal than ordinary coal cars but are also convenient for unloading coal, which can greatly reduce the physical labor of coal unloaders. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Non-Exploding Thermos Bottle Liners
    A new glass formula and technical operation method for preventing the explosion of thermos bottle liners has been formulated in Shanghai. This is the result of a technical group led by the Ministry of Light Industry, dedicated to exploring and solving the problem of thermos bottle liner explosions, after three months of research in Shanghai.
    The group included glass experts, engineering and technical personnel selected by thermos bottle factories from various regions, and veteran technicians with decades of operating experience. They started by studying the causes of thermos bottle liner explosions, found a new set of technical operation methods, and formulated nine glass formulas for manufacturing thermos bottle liners. They made a batch of thermos bottle liner blanks using each formula, conducted performance comparison tests on temperature shock and pressure resistance, and selected the best formula. More than 5,000 thermos bottle liners made with this formula were filled with calcium chloride solution exceeding the boiling point of water, stored for 24 hours, and then re-soaked in boiling water without exploding.
    The new formula and technical operation method for manufacturing this type of thermos bottle liner is now ready to be promoted to thermos bottle factories across the country. (Xinhua News Agency)

    掌握新技术  增加新产品
    新柴油机
    我国第一个五年计划的一项重大新产品——六百匹马力的大型船用柴油机，已经由上海公私合营新中动力机厂试制成功。从9月28日起，这台柴油机经过了一百九十二小时的试运转和其它种种特性试验，不仅空运转情况良好，并且在六百六十匹超负荷试验的时候，运转也正常。
    这种柴油机是目前我国制造的马力最大的一种柴油机。它是根据捷克斯洛伐克制造的新式柴油机和其他有关资料，由我国技术人员自行测验、设计的。这种新型柴油机的体重同新中动力机厂目前生产的二百五十匹马力柴油机的体重比较，平均每匹马力轻八公斤；用油也比二百五十匹马力柴油机省。这种柴油机操纵灵活，因此适宜于船上使用。此外，这种柴油机只要稍微改动一些设计，还可以作为陆上发电或矿用机械动力设备；马力可以提高到六百七十五匹。（新华社）
    不用镍的铝铁磁钢
    上海公私合营江南电工器材厂技术人员戴文周等，最近试制成功一种完全不用镍的铝铁磁钢。
    磁钢是电讯、电器工业方面用途相当广的器材。扩音喇叭的头子里，电话耳机的听筒里，以及许多种的仪表里，都需要用磁钢。制造优质磁钢要用相当多的镍。镍在我国是一种稀有的贵金属，而许多重要的工业产品又不得不用镍。因为缺少镍，江南电工器材厂的磁钢生产曾受到相当严重的影响。
    江南电工器材厂试制铝铁磁钢，是经过一百多次摸索试验，掌握了在这种磁钢里加炭和磁钢的淬火技术以后获得成功的。用这种磁钢装配的簧舌喇叭，经中央广播事业管理局测定，除掉体积略大以外，其音质不次于铝镍铁磁钢。用这种磁钢来制造簧舌喇叭头子，在上海一地一年就可以节约近十吨镍。
    现在这个工厂正在积极筹备生产。　（新华社）
    自动用电控制器
    一种可以自动调整车床电力的自动用电控制器，最近在太原矿山机器厂试验成功。测验的结果证明，这种装备可以节省大量电力。一切负荷不固定的车床，都可以使用这种控制器。
    自动用电控制器是这个厂的八级技术工人张伟烈试验成功的。他在一部车床上增加了一个电流负荷维电器和一个吸力闸控制的辅助接触物。这种装置可以根据车床开动的转数和吃刀量，自动调整电力负荷。这样，便避免过去由于经常用大电力运转所造成的电力消耗。
    张伟烈是太原矿山机器厂第一加工车间的电气工。他从今年8月开始研究这种装置。在太原电业局工程师的帮助下，先后画过二十多张草图，经过许多次的试验。
    现在，太原电业局的技术人员正在进一步研究这种装置。他们说，这种装置将向全国各有关工业部门推荐。　（新华社）
    多产的联动机
    上海公私合营明泰机器铁工厂最近在大隆机器厂和中原电机厂协助下，试制成功一种高压油泵涂粉联动机。
    高压油泵涂粉联动机的效率很高，在一秒钟内能生产七根品质优良的电焊棒。
    经上海电焊棒制造厂试用后，产量比过去螺旋车高一倍多，而操作工人却减少了一半，而且，可以采用国产药粉（涂电焊棒的原料）制成品质优良的电焊棒，使电焊棒的成品降低30％左右。单以这套机器的产量计算，每年就可为国家节约十五万元外汇。　（钱严军）
    好大的货车
    齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂最近制造出一批新型货车。其中有一种是载重六十吨的低开门煤车；另外一种是载重六十吨的全钢重型货车。
    这两种货车因为全部是用钢铁制成的，因此坚固耐用，载重量比我国现有的三十吨货车提高了一倍。
    全钢重型货车被用来载运国内外出产的重型设备，可以成套、成件地装运，使重型设备不致因拆散得太厉害而增加安装设备的工作量，同时设备在途中维护也比较容易。低开门煤车不但装煤量比一般煤车多，而且卸煤方便，可以大大减轻卸煤工人的体力劳动。　（新华社）
  不爆的热水瓶胆
    一套新的防止热水瓶胆爆破的玻璃配方和技术操作法，已经在上海制定了。这是轻工业部领导的一个专门探索和解决热水瓶胆爆破问题的技术小组，在上海经过三个月的研究以后所得的结果。
    参加这个小组的有玻璃专家、各地热水瓶厂选派的工程技术人员和积有几十年操作经验的老技工。他们从研究热水瓶胆爆破的原因着手，找出一套新的技术操作法，并且拟订出九种制造热水瓶胆的玻璃配方。他们把每个配方制成的一批热水瓶胆坯子，进行温度突变和承受压力的性能比较试验，选择了其中一种最好的配方。用这种配方制成的五千多只热水瓶胆，灌满了超过水的沸点温度的氯化钙溶液，经过二十四小时的存放，再重新泡上开水，没有发生爆裂。
    现在，制造这种热水瓶胆的新的配方和技术操作法，准备在全国热水瓶厂推广。（新华社）
