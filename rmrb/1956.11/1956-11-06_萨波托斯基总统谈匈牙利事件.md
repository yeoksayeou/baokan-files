Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 5th. Czechoslovak President Zapotocky delivered a radio address in Prague on the evening of November 3rd.

In his speech, President Zapotocky discussed the Hungarian events. Speaking of the rampage of counter-revolutionary forces in Hungary, he pointed out that the plan executed by the Hungarian reactionaries and Western imperialists was directed not only at the Hungarian people's regime, but also at the socialist countries and the entire world. However, we firmly believe that the Hungarian working class and the Hungarian people will not abandon their socialist achievements. Because anyone who has enjoyed even a month of free life will not voluntarily put on the shackles of capitalist enslavement again.

The Czechoslovak people clearly know that world reactionary forces are not only betting on Hungary. They also harbor the aim of subverting the people's democratic countries and dividing their unity. Hostile foreign newspapers have openly expressed disappointment at the strong political and economic situation of Czechoslovakia. However, they still hope that our stability will be disrupted, but this hope has been dashed.

Zapotocky then mentioned that recently, secret agents, spies, and provocateurs have stepped up their infiltration into Czechoslovak territory, but thanks to the vigilance of the security organs and the entire people, they have all been caught.

Zapotocky said that it is precisely in these days that our people have expressed full confidence in the Czechoslovak Communist Party. At its representative conference, the Party drew correct conclusions based on the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Party will do everything possible to make the country prosperous and improve the people's lives.

Speaking of the imperialist aggression against Egypt, Zapotocky said that the Hungarian events and the Egyptian events are a common conspiracy of international reactionary forces and destroyers of peace.

Zapotocky said that we will expand socialist democracy in the future, but we cannot allow our democratic rights to be used to engage in hostile activities that obstruct the cause of socialist construction.

Zapotocky concluded by saying that now, when those who are hostile to peace are trying to alienate socialist countries, our sacred duty is to strengthen friendship and alliance with the great Soviet Union and all socialist countries in the spirit of the Soviet government's declaration on developing and further strengthening friendship between socialist countries.

    萨波托斯基总统谈匈牙利事件
    新华社布拉格5日电　捷克斯洛伐克总统萨波托斯基11月3日晚间在布拉格发表了广播演说。
    萨波托斯基总统在演说中谈到匈牙利事件。他在谈到匈牙利反革命势力在匈牙利逞凶的时候指出，匈牙利反动派和西方帝国主义者所执行的计划不仅针对匈牙利人民政权，并且也针对社会主义各国、针对整个世界。但是，我们坚决相信，匈牙利的工人阶级和匈牙利人民不会放弃他们的社会主义成果。因为凡是得到那怕是一个月自由生活的人，他也不会自愿地再带上资本主义奴役的枷锁。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民清楚地知道，世界反动势力不仅把赌注押在匈牙利。他们还抱着颠复人民民主国家和分裂它们的团结的目的。敌对的外国报纸对于捷克斯洛伐克的政治和经济状况十分巩固，公然表示失望。然而它们仍然希望我们的安定会遭到破坏，但是，这种希望落空了。
    萨波托斯基接着提到最近特务和间谍以及挑衅分子加紧潜入捷克斯洛伐克领土，但是由于保安机关和全体人民的警惕，他们都落网了。
    萨波托斯基说，正是在这些天，我国人民对捷克斯洛伐克共产党表示充分信任。党在它的代表会议上根据苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的历史性的决议得出了正确的结论。党将竭尽一切努力以使国家繁荣和改善人民的生活。
    萨波托斯基讲到帝国主义对埃及的侵略的时候说，匈牙利的事件和埃及的事件是国际反动势力与和平的破坏者的共同勾当。
    萨波托斯基说，我们今后将扩大社会主义民主，但是，我们不能让我们的民主权利被利用来从事阻挠社会主义建设事业的敌对活动。
    萨波托斯基最后说，现在，当敌视和平的人企图离间社会主义国家的时候，我们的神圣责任就是本着苏联政府关于发展和进一步加强社会主义国家之间的友谊的宣言的精神加强同伟大的苏联和所有社会主义国家的友谊和联盟。
