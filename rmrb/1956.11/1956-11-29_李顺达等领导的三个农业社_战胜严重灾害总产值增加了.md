Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 28th -- Xinhua News Agency reporter Wu Zanting reports: The three agricultural production cooperatives led by Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, Shen Jilan, and Wu Houli, who initiated the agricultural production increase competition nationwide, although they suffered severe disasters and did not complete this year's competition plan (after revision), their total output value has exceeded last year's. According to the materials recently released by the three cooperatives: the average yield per mu of food crops in the three cooperatives reached 376 to 400 jin, exceeding last year by 4.4% to 8.8%, and the total output value increased by more than 20.3% to 60% compared with last year. The total output value of the three cooperatives generally exceeded the targets of the first five-year plan. The total output value of the Hongxing Cooperative also exceeded the plan for the national competition.

The three cooperatives jointly proposed a nationwide agricultural production increase competition this spring. Their original plan required that the total output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production this year increase by 59% to 70% compared with last year, and the grain yield per mu should also increase by 100 to 126 jin compared with last year. Later, they respectively revised this overly high production increase target according to the specific conditions of each cooperative. At the same time, they strived to increase fertilizer application, implement measures to transform low-yielding land into high-yielding land, change single cropping to intercropping, and expand multiple cropping, dig canals and wells, expand irrigation area, popularize improved varieties, implement intensive cultivation and rational close planting and other production increase measures. However, in July, the three cooperatives suffered continuous hail, wind, and flood disasters. The Jinxing and Wuyi cooperatives were the most severely affected, and most of the autumn crops were damaged. After the disaster occurred, each cooperative immediately launched a production and disaster relief struggle. The Jinxing and Wuyi cooperatives organized more than 700 male and female members into shock brigades, and universally hoed the more than 2,000 mu of corn and millet fields that were severely affected by the disaster, applied topdressing fertilizer, and replanted radishes in more than 1,200 mu of corn that had been broken and lodged, and also carried out seedling support and soil consolidation. In addition to completing the replanting task of more than 100 mu, the members of the Jinxing Cooperative also planted radishes and vegetable roots on small plots of wasteland in the ravines, newly padded river beaches, and the edges of soil and water conservation pits scattered on the slopes. The members of the Hongxing Cooperative continuously supported more than 650 mu of corn and millet that had been blown down by the wind twice. In the fierce disaster relief struggle, Guo Yu'en and Shen Jilan led the members day and night to inspect the dikes in the rainstorm, and successively rushed to plug four breaches, so that more than 420 mu of crops were spared from flooding. Through these struggles, the total grain output of the Jinxing and Wuyi cooperatives still increased compared with last year.

After the disaster, the three cooperatives vigorously developed animal husbandry, forestry, and various sideline productions. The number of pigs and chickens raised alone has doubled compared with the past. According to statistics in mid-November, the income from sideline production alone in the three cooperatives has reached more than 27,000 yuan, and together with the income from agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production, it has ensured that the income of more than 90% of the members exceeded last year.

At present, the three cooperatives are combining the development of winter production, inspecting and summarizing the situation of carrying out the production increase competition over the past year, and preparing to draw on experience and lessons to formulate next year's production increase plan.

    李顺达等领导的三个农业社
    战胜严重灾害总产值增加了
    新华社太原28日电　新华社记者武赞庭报道：向全国发起农业增产竞赛的李顺达、郭玉恩、申纪兰和武侯梨领导的三个农业生产合作社，虽然遭受严重灾害没有完成今年的竞赛计划，（经过修订的）但总产值都超过了去年。据最近三个社公布的材料：三个社粮食作物每亩平均产量达三百七十六斤到四百斤，超过去年4.4％到8.8％，总产值比去年增加20.3％到60％以上，三个社总产值普遍超额完成了第一个五年计划指标。红星社总产值还超额完成了向全国竞赛的计划。
    三个社是今年春季联名向全国提出开展农业增产竞赛倡议的。他们原计划要求今年农林牧副业的生产总值比去年增加59％到70％，每亩地的粮食产量也要比去年增加一百到一百二十六斤，后来又分别根据各社具体情况，重新修改了这种过高的增产指标。同时努力增施肥料、实行低产变高产、单作变间作和扩大复播，开渠打井，扩大浇地面积，普及优良品种，实行精耕细作和合理密植等增产措施。但到了7月，这三个社连续遭受雹、风、洪水灾害，其中金星、五一两社最重，大部秋作物受到摧残。各个社在发生灾害后，立即开展了生产救灾斗争。金星和五一两个社以七百多个男女社员组织了突击队，把受灾较重的二千多亩玉米和谷子地普遍多锄了一次，施了追肥，其中还有一千二百多亩被打断和倒伏的玉米都补种了萝卜，并进行了扶苗培土。金星社的社员们除完成了一百多亩改种任务外，还在山沟里的小块荒地、新垫成的河滩地和散布在山坡上的水土保持坑壕的边堰上种了萝卜和菜根。红星社的社员连续两次扶起了六百五十多亩被风吹倒的玉米和谷子。在剧烈的抗灾斗争中，郭玉恩和申纪兰曾在暴雨中带领社员夜以继日地检查堤坝，先后抢堵了四个决口，使四百二十多亩作物免除洪水淹没。经过这些斗争，金星和五一两个社的粮食总产量还比去年增产。
    三个社在受灾后大力发展了畜牧、林业和各种副业生产。仅喂养的猪、鸡就比过去增加了一倍左右。到11月中旬统计，三个社仅副业生产的收入已达二万七千多元，连同农林畜牧业生产的收入，就保证了90％以上的社员收入超过了去年。
    目前，三个社正结合开展冬季生产，检查总结一年来开展增产竞赛的情况，准备吸取经验教训制定明年的增产计划。
