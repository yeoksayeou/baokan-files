Xinhua News Agency, November 29th. Chargé d'Affaires of the Albanian Embassy in China, Bino, held a reception tonight to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the liberation of Albania.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Acting Premier Chen Yun attended tonight's reception.

Chen Yun said at the meeting: "Today, when international reactionary forces are frantically provoking the socialist movement, it is of greater significance to strengthen the unity between our two countries and among the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. I believe that in the future, we will continue to develop the friendship and cooperation between our two countries and among the socialist countries in the spirit of mutual respect, mutual trust, mutual assistance, and mutual learning, thereby making greater contributions to the just cause of mankind."

At the beginning of the banquet, Bino said at the meeting that for twelve years, we have established a free and independent life. On the road of socialist construction, various great economic, political, social, and cultural reforms have greatly changed the face of Albania. The achievement of all these achievements is inseparable from the patriotism of the broad masses and the comprehensive and continuous assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries.

Bino also said that the people of our country deeply hate the imperialist aggression conspiracy. The three countries of Britain, France, and Israel used various methods to seize the freedom of the Egyptian people, but the Egyptian people have the support of peace-loving people from all over the world, and the Albanian people also firmly support the Egyptian people.

Bino mentioned that the economic, political, and cultural relations between Albania and China are increasingly consolidated and developed. He said that the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations have received the firm support of our country and peace-loving people all over the world. Without the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, this not only hinders the normal activities of this organization, but also hinders the rational solution of major international issues.

After Bino spoke, Chen Yun continued to say: Under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian government, the heroic Albanian people have achieved great achievements in building socialism. At the same time, the freedom- and peace-loving Albanian people have made many contributions to strengthening international cooperation and maintaining world peace. Albania's international status has been raised to an unprecedented level. The Chinese people are extremely happy about every achievement made by the Albanian people.

Chen Yun mentioned that in recent years, the friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese and Albanian peoples have achieved comprehensive development. He said that the friendly unity, economic mutual assistance, and cultural exchanges between our two countries are more consolidated and developed than at any time in history.

Also present at tonight's reception were Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu, as well as Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Burhan, Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, and people from all walks of life.

Diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China also attended the reception.

    比诺代办举行招待会
    庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放日
    新华社29日讯　阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使馆临时代办比诺今晚举行招待会，庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十二周年。
    刘少奇委员长和陈云代总理出席了今晚招待会。
    陈云在会上讲话说：“今天当国际反动势力向社会主义运动进行疯狂挑衅的时候，加强我们两国间以及以苏联为首的社会主义各国间的团结，更具有重大的意义。我相信，今后我们将继续本着相互尊重、相互信任、相互帮助和相互学习的精神，来发展我们两国和社会主义各国间的友谊和合作，从而对人类正义事业作出更大的贡献。”
    宴会开始时，比诺在会上讲话说，十二年来，我们建立了自由和独立的生活。在社会主义建设的道路上，各种伟大的经济、政治、社会和文化的改革，大大地改变了阿尔巴尼亚的面貌。这一切成就的获得是和广大群众的爱国主义，和苏联、中国的以及各人民民主国家的全面的不断的帮助分不开的。
    比诺又说，我国人民深切地痛恨帝国主义的侵略阴谋。英、法、以三国用各种方法来夺取埃及人民的自由，但是埃及人民有着世界各国爱好和平的人民的支持，阿尔巴尼亚人民也坚决地支持埃及人民。
    比诺谈到，阿中两国的经济、政治和文化关系日益巩固和发展。他说，中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利，受到了我国和全世界爱好和平的人民的坚决支持。没有中华人民共和国的合法代表在联合国组织中，这不但有妨害这一组织的正常活动，同时也阻挡着国际重大问题的合理解决。
    在比诺讲话后，陈云接着讲话说：英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚政府的领导下，在建设社会主义事业中已获得了巨大的成就。同时热爱自由和和平的阿尔巴尼亚人民在加强国际合作和维护世界和平事业中都作出了不少的贡献。阿尔巴尼亚国际地位获得了前所未有的提高。中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民所取得的每一个成就，都感到极大的欢欣。
    陈云谈到，近年来，中阿两国人民的友好合作关系，获得了全面的发展。他说，我们两国间的友好团结、经济互助和文化交流比历史上任何时候都更加巩固和发展了。
    出席今晚招待会的，还有李先念、聂荣臻副总理，郭沫若副委员长，董必武院长，以及政协全国委员会副主席鲍尔汉，外交部代部长张闻天和各界人士。
    各国驻华使节和外交官员也出席了招待会。
