Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th - TASS reported from Moscow on November 15th: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, wrote letters to British Prime Minister Eden and French Prime Minister Mollet on November 15th, requesting that, now that a ceasefire has been achieved in Egypt, no new conflicts should be provoked, and that the British, French, and Israeli troops should withdraw from Egypt immediately.

Bulganin's letter stated: The Soviet government expresses its satisfaction with the cessation of military operations in Egypt. The common goal now is not to provoke conflicts, but to find ways to eliminate the current situation in the Near East that endangers the cause of peace and to peacefully resolve outstanding issues.

The letter pointed out that although a ceasefire has been achieved in Egypt, the British, French, and Israeli troops have been slow to withdraw from Egyptian territory, and there are even reports that armed forces are still being assembled in the region. This situation is dangerous and will only further complicate the situation.

Bulganin hoped that no "measures that could be seen as preparing for a new campaign against Egypt" would be taken. Because, in the current situation, even a small spark could reignite a raging fire here.

The governments of Britain, France, and Israel should "immediately withdraw all invading forces from Egyptian territory, in accordance with the requirements of the Egyptian government and the resolutions of the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly."

The Soviet Union still believes that as long as the British, French, and Israeli troops withdraw from Egyptian territory, there is no need to establish a United Nations armed force. However, given that the Egyptian government has agreed to this in principle, the Soviet government does not object to the entry of the United Nations armed force (into Egypt). However, the issue of the stationing of the United Nations armed force and the duration of their stay in Egypt must be agreed upon by the Egyptian government.

Bulganin believed in the letter that these armed forces could be stationed bilaterally along the military demarcation line between Israel and Egypt as stipulated in the Armistice Agreement. These troops should not be stationed in the Suez Canal area, as this would be contrary to the 1888 Convention. Moreover, troops from countries that supported the aggression against Egypt should not participate in this international armed force.

Bulganin requested that everyone now "work together to find a way to end Israel's provocations against Arab countries." He also advocated for the establishment of an international committee with Egyptian participation to meet Egypt's demands for compensation for the losses it has suffered.

Bulganin finally addressed the issue of the situation in Hungary mentioned by Eden and Mollet in their previous letters to Bulganin. He said: When the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, in view of the danger to the homeland, requested assistance from the Soviet government, we considered it our duty to provide assistance, which is only natural. Any attempt to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs and Hungary's mutual relations with the Soviet Union is completely unjustified and should be resolutely opposed.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th - TASS reported from Moscow on November 15th: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, said in a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion on the 15th that Israeli armed forces should immediately withdraw from Egyptian territory.

At the same time, in order to stabilize the situation in the Near East and eliminate the consequences of the aggression against Egypt, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to take some measures to eliminate the possibility of Israel resuming provocations against its neighbors and to ensure lasting peace and tranquility in the Middle East.

Bulganin continued, it is just that Israel, Britain, and France compensate Egypt for the losses it suffered from the unprovoked aggression. These losses were caused by the destruction of Egyptian cities and towns, the interruption of navigation on the Suez Canal, and the destruction of canal structures. At the same time, Israel must return to Egypt all property looted by the Israeli armed forces that invaded Egypt from Egyptian territory.

According to the United Nations resolution, the United Nations international armed force established with the consent of the Egyptian government should be stationed on the military demarcation line between Israel and Egypt as stipulated in the Armistice Agreement.

Bulganin's letter was a reply to Ben-Gurion's letter to him on November 8th.

In his letter, Ben-Gurion tried to justify Israel's aggressive actions against Egypt. Ben-Gurion insisted that the invasion of Egyptian territory by Israeli armed forces was a necessity for self-defense, while also using Egypt's alleged threat to Israel as an excuse.

Bulganin pointed out in his letter that, in fact, according to a number of Security Council resolutions, the perpetrator of numerous armed attacks on the territory of Arab neighboring countries was precisely Israel, not other Arab countries.

Bulganin said that even when the Israeli government had to accept the decision to withdraw its troops from Egypt, it attempted to propose conditions for the implementation of this requirement, namely reaching a "satisfactory agreement" with the United Nations on the entry of an international armed force into the "Suez Canal area," and it is well known that the Suez Canal area is an inalienable part of the sovereign Egyptian state.

Bulganin said that the Soviet government believes that Israel's current policy of inciting hostility towards the Arabs and suppressing the Arabs is, in fact, a policy that endangers world peace and leads Israel to destruction. In fact, as recent events have demonstrated, this policy only serves the interests of external forces that are trying to restore the colonial system in this region, and we are deeply convinced that this policy is contrary to the interests of all countries in the Middle East without exception.

### 布尔加宁再函英法以要求撤出侵埃部队赔偿埃及损失

    布尔加宁再函英法以要求撤出侵埃部队赔偿埃及损失
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁11月15日分别写信给英国首相艾登和法国总理摩勒，要求在目前埃及已经停火的情况下，不要挑起新的冲突，并且要求英国、法国和以色列的军队立即撤出埃及。
    布尔加宁的信写道：苏联政府对目前埃及境内的军事行动已经停止这一点表示满意。当前的共同目标是，不要挑起冲突，而是设法消除中近东当前危及和平事业的局势，和平解决悬而未决的问题。
    信里指出，埃及境内虽然已经停火，但是英、法和以色列的军队还迟迟没有撤出埃及领土，甚至有消息说，在这一地区还在集结武装部队，这种局面是危险的，它只会使局势进一步复杂化。
    布尔加宁希望不要“采取可能被认为是准备对埃及发动新的战役的措施”。因为，在目前情况下，只要一点点火星就能在这里重新引起熊熊的火焰。
    英、法和以色列三国政府应当“按照埃及政府的要求和联合国大会紧急会议的决议的规定，立即从埃及领土上撤出一切侵略军”。
    苏联仍然认为，只要英、法和以色列的军队撤出埃及领土，就没有必要建立联合国武装部队。但是，鉴于埃及政府在原则上同意这一点，苏联政府不反对联合国武装部队的开入（埃及）。不过，关于联合国武装部队驻扎的问题以及它们驻留埃及的期限问题，必须取得埃及政府的同意。
    布尔加宁在信里认为，这些武装部队可以沿着停战协定所规定的以色列和埃及之间的军事分界线双边驻扎，这些军队不应当驻扎在苏伊士运河地区，因为这是同1888年公约相违背的。而且，支持侵略埃及的国家的军队不能参加这支国际武装部队。
    布尔加宁要求大家现在“同心协力寻找出一种能够结束以色列对阿拉伯国家的挑衅的办法”。他还主张成立一个有埃及参加的国际委员会，来满足埃及关于赔偿它所遭受的损失的要求。
    布尔加宁最后谈到了艾登和摩勒在前次给布尔加宁的信中所提到的匈牙利的局势的问题。他说：当匈牙利工农革命政府鉴于危险临到祖国，请求苏联政府给予帮助的时候，我们认为给予帮助是自己的责任，这是理所当然的事。任何方面企图干涉匈牙利的内政和匈牙利同苏联的互相关系，都是完全没有理由的，这种企图应当坚决加以反对。
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁15日在给以色列总理本—古里安的信中说，以色列武装部队应当立刻撤离埃及领土。
    同时，为了稳定近东地区局势和消除侵略埃及所产生的后果，苏联政府认为有必要采取一些措施，以排除以色列重新对它的邻国进行挑衅的可能性和保障中东的持久和平和安宁。
    布尔加宁接着说，由以色列、英国和法国赔偿遭受无端侵略的埃及所蒙受的损失是公正的。这种损失是由于埃及城市和村镇遭到破坏、由于苏伊士运河中断通航和运河建筑物遭到破坏而造成的。同时，以色列必须把入侵埃及的以色列武装部队从埃及领土上掠夺的一切财产归还埃及。
    根据联合国决议，经埃及政府同意建立的联合国国际武装部队应当驻扎在停战协定所规定的以色列和埃及之间的军事分界线上。
    布尔加宁这封信是对本—古里安11月8日给他的信的答复。
    本—古里安在信中力图为以色列对埃及所采取的侵略行动辩护。本—古里安硬说以色列武装部队侵犯埃及领土是出于自卫的必要，同时还拿埃及对以色列有某种威胁作为借口。
    布尔加宁在信中指出，事实上，根据安全理事会的一些决议，多次武装进攻阿拉伯邻国领土的肇事者恰恰是以色列，而不是其他阿拉伯国家。
    布尔加宁说，以色列政府甚至在不得不接受关于把军队撤出埃及的决定的时候，还企图提出执行这项要求的条件，即同联合国达成一项关于国际武装部队开进“苏伊士运河区”的“令人满意的协议”，而大家知道，苏伊士运河区是自主的埃及国家的不可剥夺的一部分。
    布尔加宁说，苏联政府相信，以色列目前实行的以激起同阿拉伯人的敌意和压制阿拉伯人为方针的政策，实际上是一种危及世界和平的政策、使以色列招致灭亡的政策。事实上，如最近的事件所证明的，这种政策只符合力图在这个地区恢复殖民主义制度的外来势力的利益，我们深信，这种政策是同中近东一无例外的所有国家人民的利益相违背的。
