Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 27th. The Soviet “Literary Gazette” published on November 22nd an open letter from Soviet writers to French writers who recently published a statement in "France Observateur" opposing the just actions of the Soviet army in helping the Hungarian government suppress counter-revolutionary forces. These French writers are Jean-Paul Sartre, Vercors, Claude Roy, Roger Vailland, Jacques-Francis Rolland, and Claude Morgan, among twenty-one others.

The Soviet writers who signed this open letter include: Mikhail Sholokhov, Konstantin Fedin, Leonid Leonov, Valentin Kataev, Alexei Surkov, Nikolai Tikhonov, Konstantin Simonov, Alexander Korneichuk, and thirty-five others.

The letter stated that, indeed, the events in Hungary were painful, but you only see one side of the matter; you only talk about the Soviet army's participation in this event, although this fact does not prevent you from seeing other events happening in the world. When we talk about the Hungarian events and your attitude towards them, we must say: you are wrong! You have not seen the whole truth.

The open letter said that the Hungarian people were dissatisfied with the situation in their country. They were dissatisfied with the Hungarian leaders' failure to express their determination to thoroughly eliminate the damage to socialist democracy and the rule of law in the country, and to strengthen their concern for the needs of the working people. When the Hungarian people raised their legitimate demands to their leaders, everyone in our country sympathized with these demands. On October 30th, the Soviet government issued a declaration on further strengthening the foundations of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Soviet troops also withdrew from Budapest at the request of the then Imre Nagy government. You remember what happened later; the counter-revolutionaries decided that their time had come.

The open letter then talked about the fact that reactionary elements in Western countries, American spy centers there, and the "Radio Free Europe" incited and supported Hungarian counter-revolutionaries, and about the white terror created by counter-revolutionaries and Horthy fascists in Hungary.

The open letter said, you all remember what the Nazis did during the occupation of France. What is the difference between the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries and the Nazis? There is only one difference: the Nazis had seized power in France at that time, while the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries did not succeed in seizing power in Hungary.

We feel that in these difficult days, you have believed the slander, lies, and hostile reports of those who are enemies of our friends in France. It is precisely during these days, when you published statements against us, calling for "the victory of truth," that Soviet soldiers, at the cost of their own lives, saved tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of lives, saving them from the atrocities of the fascists.

If Soviet soldiers had not done this, we are convinced that in a few days you would have written another statement—protesting the mad and bloody atrocities committed by the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries.

The open letter concluded by saying that we do not want the dark past of 1933, when the fascists were in power, to be replayed in history, and we do not want such past events to be repeated in Hungary or anywhere else!

### 苏联作家写信给法国一些作家  说明苏军援助匈牙利的重要意义

    苏联作家写信给法国一些作家
    说明苏军援助匈牙利的重要意义
    新华社莫斯科27日电　苏联“文学报”11月22日刊载了苏联作家给最近在“法兰西观察家”上发表声明反对苏联军队帮助匈牙利政府镇压反革命势力的正义行动的法国作家的一封公开信。这些法国作家是让—保罗·萨特、维尔高尔、克洛德·罗阿、罗歇·瓦伊扬、雅克—弗朗西·罗兰和克洛德·摩岗等二十一人。
    在这封公开信上签名的苏联作家包括：萧洛霍夫、费定、列昂诺夫、卡塔耶夫、苏尔科夫、吉洪诺夫、西蒙诺夫、考涅楚克等三十五人。
    信中说，的确，匈牙利发生的事件是沉痛的，但是，你们仅看到事情的一面，你们只谈苏联军队参加这一事件，尽管这一事实并不妨碍你们看到世界上发生的其他事件。我们谈到匈牙利事件和你们对这个事件的态度时，我们要说：你们是错了！你们没有看见全面的真相。
    公开信说，匈牙利人民不满意自己国内的局势。他们不满意匈牙利的领导人没有表示将坚决彻底地消除国内的对社会主义民主和法制的破坏，并且加强对劳动人民的需要的关怀。当匈牙利人民向他们的领导人提出了人民的正当要求的时候，在我国大家都很同情这种要求。10月30日苏联政府发表了关于进一步加强苏联和其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言。苏联军队应当时的伊姆雷·纳吉政府的请求也从布达佩斯撤退了。你们记得，后来发生了什么事情，反革命分子决定，他们的时候到了。
    公开信接着谈到了西方国家的反动分子、美国在那里的间谍中心和“自由欧洲”电台煽动和支持匈牙利反革命分子的事实，谈到了反革命分子、霍尔蒂法西斯分子在匈牙利制造白色恐怖的情况。
    公开信说，你们都记得，在法国被占领时期纳粹分子干了些什么。匈牙利反革命分子和纳粹分子之间有什么区别呢？只有一点区别：纳粹分子当时曾夺取了法国的政权，而匈牙利反革命分子并没有能夺取匈牙利的政权。
    我们觉得，在这些困难的日子里，你们相信了那些对我国在法国的朋友的诽谤、谎言和敌视报道。正在这些日子里，当你们发表反对我们的声明，号召“真理的胜利”的时候，苏联兵士不惜牺牲自己的生命，挽救了几万人，也许是几十万人的生命，使他们免遭法西斯的残害。
    如果苏联士兵不这样做，我们深信，再过一些时候，你们就会写出另一种声明——抗议匈牙利反革命分子所干的疯狂的、血腥的暴行。
    公开信最后说，我们不愿意使1933年法西斯当政的黑暗的往事在历史上重演，不论在匈牙利或在任何其他地方都不要再重演这样的往事！
