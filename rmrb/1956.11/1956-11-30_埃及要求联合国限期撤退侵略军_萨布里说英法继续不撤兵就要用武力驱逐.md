Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 29th -- Sabri, Director of the Political Bureau of the Egyptian Presidential Office, said at a press conference on the 28th that Egypt has asked UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to stipulate a deadline for the withdrawal of British, French, and Israeli troops from Egypt. He said that this request was made by Foreign Minister Fawzi to the UN Secretary-General.

When asked by reporters about the situation in Syria and Jordan, Sabri said: "Obviously, there is currently a conspiracy against Syria and Jordan. But I think this conspiracy will fail, first because of Arab nationalism, and second because the Iraqi people will never agree to interfere in the internal affairs of Arab neighbors." Sabri said: "Egypt has been in contact with these two countries, and Egypt is ready to help them no matter what may happen."

Sabri's remarks were broadcast by Cairo Radio.

He also said that the Egyptian government will be responsible for clearing the Suez Canal. He said: "The United Nations can only provide us with technical and financial assistance, and it has no right to manage the canal."

Sabri said that the UN Emergency Force will withdraw from Egypt after completing its mission. He said, however, that the Egyptian government reserves the right to demand the withdrawal of this force if it fails to complete its mission and if the British, French, and Israeli troops continue to remain on Egyptian territory.

Sabri warned: "If the aggressor troops remain in Egypt, fighting is very likely to resume in Egypt." Therefore, he said, Egyptian troops need to be further strengthened.

Sabri said that Egypt has requested assistance from some countries in the world, and some countries have expressed their willingness to send volunteers. He said that Egypt has not refused volunteers from coming, but has only postponed the time for volunteers to come.

Sabri refuted the rumor that Soviet officers had fought alongside the Egyptian army, denouncing the rumor as "nonsense." He also stated that Egypt's cooperation with the Soviet Union is cooperation as one country with another, not ideological cooperation.

Sabri denied that all foreigners were forced to leave Egypt. He said that all foreigners can choose to stay or leave on their own, except for those who are considered to be harmful to Egypt. He also denied that the Egyptian government had ordered the expulsion of all Jews. He said: "There are currently bad elements who have been proven to be colluding with the enemy. Only these people will be expelled, and the rest can stay."

    埃及要求联合国限期撤退侵略军
    萨布里说英法继续不撤兵就要用武力驱逐
    新华社29日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统府政治局长萨布里28日在记者招待会上说，埃及已经要求联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德规定英法以色列三国军队撤离埃及的期限。他说，这项要求是由外交部长法齐向联合国秘书长提出的。
    当记者问到关于叙利亚和约旦的局势的时候，萨布里说：“显然，目前存在着反对叙利亚和约旦的阴谋。但是我认为这种阴谋是要失败的，第一由于阿拉伯的民族主义，第二由于伊拉克人民是决不会同意干涉阿拉伯邻国的内政的。”萨布里说：“埃及一直在同这两个国家进行接触，不论可能发生什么情况，埃及都准备帮助他们。”
    萨布里的谈话由开罗电台作了广播。
    他还说，埃及政府将负责清理苏伊士运河。他说：“联合国只可以供应我们技术和财政援助，它无权管理运河。”
    萨布里说，联合国紧急部队完成任务后就将撤出埃及。他说，但是埃及政府保留这样一个权利，即：万一这支部队没有完成任务，万一英法以色列三国军队继续留在埃及领土上的话，埃及就可以要求这支部队撤出。
    萨布里警告说：“假如侵略军队仍然留在埃及的话，在埃及很有可能会重新发生战斗。”因此，他说，需要进一步加强埃及的部队。
    萨布里说，埃及曾经向世界一些国家要求给予援助，有些国家曾经表示愿意派遣志愿人员。他说，埃及没有拒绝志愿人员前来，只是推迟了志愿人员前来的时间。
    萨布里驳斥了所谓苏联军官曾经同埃及军队一起作战的谣言，斥责这种谣言是“胡说”。他还表示，埃及同苏联的合作是作为同一个国家的合作，不是意识形态上的合作。
    萨布里否认所有外国人都被迫离开埃及。他说，除了被认为是危害埃及的人以外，所有外国人都可以自己选择去留。他还否认埃及政府曾经下令驱逐所有犹太人出境。他说：“目前存在着已经证明在同敌人勾结的坏分子。只有这种人将被驱逐出去，其余的人可以留下来。”
