    The Chinese People Will Always Stand With the Hungarian People
    —Welcoming the Hungarian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble
    Chen Yi
    While we are all deeply concerned about the situation in Hungary, the Hungarian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble is visiting our capital. Just as when I met them in Hankou, I deeply admire them. My admiration is not only for their excellent and diverse performances (which I will discuss below), but also for the fact that after they already knew about the sudden events happening in their country, and as one of their members said, faced the danger of "the Party, the nation, and the family being destroyed," they still tried their best to suppress their grief and indignation, and performed for our people and army according to the plan, performance after performance. In Hankou, they even voluntarily added a performance for our army, saying that the army rarely has a Sunday off. Especially when they sang three Chinese songs in Chinese: "The Crescent Moon Climbs Up," "Guerrilla Song," and "Dialogue of Flowers," their pronunciation was so clear and their intonation so harmonious that it can be said they fully grasped the emotions of the Chinese songs. Everyone who heard them felt that this was something that even some Chinese choirs would find difficult to do. Why were they able to do this? They said it was because of their love for the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. I myself deeply felt that this was indeed the reason. They expressed to us more than once, especially during the days when the situation in Hungary was at its most serious, that some of them were singing and dancing on stage, and then going backstage to wipe away tears. The domestic situation made them uneasy, but it was also the warm welcome, care, and warmth of the Chinese comrades, so they all said: "No matter what, we must do a good job in our performances in China and ensure eternal friendship with China." Their leader, Colonel Sokolyi, said at the farewell meeting in Hankou:
    "Thank you for the gifts you sent us (porcelain vases, a specialty of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi). I believe that because of the ten-plus day journey from Beijing to Budapest, we cannot guarantee that every member will not break even one of the porcelain vases they received. But even if the porcelain vases are broken, our friendship will never be broken."
    As he spoke, his eyes sparkled under the reflection of the electric lights, and the audience applauded for a long time.
    Due to what they saw and heard in China, they visited factories, rural areas, schools, and markets, and had extensive contact with people from all walks of life. In particular, Premier Zhou gave them a speech, recounting the story of our army's Long March, and especially pointed out that twenty years ago we had less than 30,000 people, but today we have won victory in all of China. Therefore, Hungary's difficulties are also temporary and will surely be overcome. This gave them great encouragement.
    These contacts and talks, coupled with the daily improvement of the situation in Hungary, and the successive receipt of letters confirming the safety of their families, gave them great confidence, and therefore their performance was unprecedentedly successful. Our audience not only enjoyed a very rich and pleasant experience in the theater, but also could see the excellent national artistic tradition of Hungary and the revolutionary will of the Hungarian people through the performance of this song and dance ensemble. Their singing can truly be described as "singing at the top of their voices," and every member of the choir can be said to be worthy of these four words.
    The first song in the chorus, "The Peacock Flies In": "The beautiful peacock lands on the roof of the prefecture government, he shines with colorful feathers to announce to the people: the fresh wind will blow all over the fields of Hungary, the dreams of the youth will be realized. Let the prefecture government ignite a raging fire, let the hearts of the slaves no longer be tormented."
    This song was written by the great Hungarian composer Kodály, twice a winner of the Hungarian Kossuth Prize. It fully displays the emotions of the Hungarian people's grief and indignation, making people feel that they must rise up in revolution. I can say that the songs they sang this time, such as "Recruiting Song" (excerpt from the opera "Háry János"), "Join Our Ranks," "Soldier's Song," "National Song" (lyrics by the poet Petőfi, music by Kodály—the lyrics are: We will use swords to replace shackles, as our decorations; we will make the name of Hungary shine again.), and "Humorous Serenade," all have a common feature, which is that they can truly inspire people. Listen to the song "Join Our Ranks," even if you don't understand a single word and don't fully understand the meaning, you can completely hear the emotion of the song: "Come, join our ranks, defend the motherland." Sometimes the audience really wants to follow along involuntarily. "Soldier's Song" sings: "With the loud sound of drums and trumpets, we march forward with firm steps. Charge! We bravely throw ourselves into battle. Neither the enemy's fortress nor the beautiful girls can stop us." It is truly magnificent and touches the heart.
    It is said that these songs are very popular among the Hungarian people and have played the role of a bugle call. Today, they can sing them again to mobilize the people, defend socialist Hungary, and severely crack down on counter-revolutionary elements. Even some lyrical songs, such as the four ancient Hungarian folk songs, the second of the Russian folk songs, and the folk song from the Šumadija region: "Félegyháza's good wine is the most famous, the delicious roast duck is on the plate, please drink to your heart's content, I am not stingy at all," are all very optimistic and humorous. When the choir sings these songs, they often come back for encores, and the audience greets the choir with stormy applause as soon as they appear.
    I must especially mention the Russian folk song "Song of the Volga Boatmen" performed a cappella. I am a person with little knowledge and experience in music, but in what I have seen and heard, this is probably one of the best performances. On the evening of November 15th, many Soviet experts praised it repeatedly, some even shouting "Glory!" and took five curtain calls. This song is performed all over our country, and the situation is almost the same. The audience has repeatedly requested an encore. From the performance of this song, we can also see their love for the long-standing traditional art of the Russian people; and this is something that no nationalist chauvinist provoker can stir up, and will be completely shattered in this great art that can touch the conscience of the two nations and exchange the feelings of the two nations.
    It should be said that the choir is the most precious part of this ensemble. Its characteristic is that it has a unified tone, and you can't hear a trace of noise. Whether it is expressing magnificent or lyrical songs, it is equally harmonious. They can have such achievements because they pay attention to it during training; when they recruit, they don't necessarily need students who have graduated from professional schools. The primary thing is the essence of the voice, requiring the same sound to be produced, and training is given once selected. They have been training for seven years, and the great Hungarian composer Kodály has guided them. After the training is mature, it is necessary to consolidate everyone's love for the ensemble, so there are very few changes in the members. Some people seem to be old and old, but he is still very comfortable in this ensemble. In addition to rehearsing various forms and content of chorus, they sometimes perform operas; this makes this ensemble maintain a high level of chorus and gain the love and praise of audiences at home and abroad in Hungary. There is no doubt that they will leave the same impact in our country.
    After Premier Zhou watched their performance and gave them a speech, the choir also sang the song "The Peacock Flies In" to Premier Zhou to thank him; they said that they had no other language, and only used this song to replace their gratitude. Premier Zhou said: "You are resolutely taking the socialist road, and with the help of the socialist family, the suffering you have suffered will soon pass." Vice Premier Peng Dehuai also especially praised the richness and national characteristics of their performances.
    Their dances also have national characteristics. What interests me most is that almost every dance has a plot, and most of them are singing and dancing. For example, the most simple "Porcelain Jar Dance" depicts a group of country girls happily holding porcelain jars and dancing. In the eyes of the audience, they not only see the dance, but also hear the beautiful folk songs. This can indeed be said to be the characteristic of Hungarian song and dance, which is especially worth learning.
    "Morning in the Barracks" has a very rich sense of life, and you can see the simple life of Hungarian soldiers; and how friendly and united the comrades are. Although there is still ridicule in it, the ridicule is well-intentioned.
    "Gypsy Dance" is performed with a high degree of skill, combined with the rich life of the Gypsies. It is extremely moving and real.
    Other single performances such as piano, harp, soprano, and bass solos can be called first-rate.
    It is our honor to receive this group of artists who have inherited the Hungarian national cultural tradition and sing the life of the socialist Hungarian people, and it is indeed a great enjoyment for the audience. Their country is suffering from the destruction after the misfortune, and bad elements are still taking the opportunity to stir up trouble. Therefore, when we listen to their songs and watch their dances, we are watching and listening with a very sympathetic heart, and we often inadvertently exchange feelings with the emotions expressed in their songs and dances. I think this is very natural, this is exactly our brotherly feeling. The socialist family relies on everyone having this kind of feeling, so we can learn from each other, support each other, and achieve victory. Therefore, the visit and performance of the Hungarian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble in our country has a special significance. They all said that they must bring what they saw and felt in China back to Hungary and turn it into the strength to rebuild socialist Hungary and the Hungarian People's Army. And we, those who receive them, as Premier Zhou said to them:
    "The Chinese people will always stand with the Hungarian people and support socialist Hungary!"
    This is also the feeling of every Chinese person.

### 中国人民永远同匈牙利人民在一起——欢迎匈牙利人民军文工团

    中国人民永远同匈牙利人民在一起
    ——欢迎匈牙利人民军文工团
    陈沂
    当我们都十分关心匈牙利的局势的时候，匈牙利人民军文工团来访问我国首都。正如我在汉口见到他们一样，我对他们是十分钦佩的。我钦佩的还不只是他们优秀、多采的演出（这方面我在下面还要谈到），我钦佩的是当他们已经知道他们国家所发生的突然事变之后，正如他们一个团员所说的
  “面临着亡党、亡国、亡家”的危险，他们仍尽力抑制着悲愤，一场一场地按着计划为我们人民和军队演出；在汉口还主动为我们军队加演了一场，他们说，军队是难得有一个星期天的。特别当他们用中国话演唱了中国的三个歌曲：“半个月亮爬上来”、“游击军歌”、“对花”，吐字之清楚，音韵之和谐，可以说是充分掌握了中国歌曲的情感，听过的人都觉得这是中国的有些合唱团都很难办到的。为什么他们能够这样呢？他们说是因为对中国人民、中国共产党、中国人民的领袖毛泽东同志的热爱，我自己也深深感到确确实实是由于这个原因。他们不只一次向我们表示，特别是在匈牙利局势最严重的那几天，他们中有些人一面在前台歌唱和舞蹈、一面完了就到后台去擦泪，是国内的局势使他们放心不下，但也是中国同志对他们的热烈欢迎、体贴和温暖，所以他们都说：“无论如何要搞好在中国的演出，保证永远和中国友好。”他们的领队索柯洛依上校在汉口送别的会上曾这样说：
    “感谢你们送我们的礼物（江西景德镇的特产瓷瓶），我相信，由于北京到布达佩斯有十几天的行程，一路上不能保证每一个团员都把他所得到的瓷瓶一个不打坏，但是，即使瓷瓶打坏、破了，我们的友谊是永远不会破的。”
    说着，他的眼睛在电灯的反射下发出星星的闪光，会场鼓掌经久不息。
    由于在中国的所见所闻，他们参观了工厂、农村、学校、市场，与多方面的人进行了广泛的接触，尤其是周总理给他们讲了话，叙述了我军长征的故事，特别指出二十年前我们还不到三万人，今天我们在全中国胜利了。因此匈牙利的困难也是暂时的，一定会胜利的。给了他们极大的鼓舞。
    这些接触和谈话，加之匈牙利局势一天天好转，他们的家庭的平安家信也陆续收到，所以他们的信心是很大的，因而演出的成绩也是空前的。我们的观众不只是在剧场得到一个非常丰满而愉快的享受，而且可以通过这个文工团的表演看到匈牙利优秀的民族艺术传统，看到匈牙利人民的革命意志。他们的歌唱实在是称得起“引吭高歌”四个字，特别是合唱队的每一个队员对这四个字都可以当之无愧。
    合唱的第一个歌子“孔雀飞来”：“美丽的孔雀落在州府的房顶上，他闪耀着五彩的羽毛向人们宣布：新鲜的风将把匈牙利的田野吹遍，青年的幻想将要实现。让州府燃起熊熊的烈火，让奴隶的心灵再不受折磨”。
    这首歌曲是匈牙利柯树特奖金两次获得者、匈牙利的大作曲家柯达伊写的，充分显示匈牙利人民的悲愤的情绪，使人听了觉得非起来革命不可。我可以说，他们这次所唱的歌，像“募兵曲”（歌剧“哈里·扬努士”选曲）、“参加我们的队伍”、“士兵之歌”、“民族歌”（诗人裴多菲作词、柯达伊作曲——歌词是：我们要用战刀来代替枷锁，作我们的装饰品；我们要使匈牙利这个名字重新发出光芒。）以及“幽默小夜曲”等，都有一个共同的特点，即是真正能振奋人心。你听“参加我们的队伍”这个歌吧，即使你一个字也不懂，意思也不完全明白，但是歌的情感却完全可以听得出：“来，参加我们的队伍，保卫祖国。”观众有时真是不期然地要跟着去哩。“士兵之歌”中这样唱着：“随着战鼓和军号响亮的声音，我们迈着坚定的步伐前进。冲呵！我们勇猛地投入战斗。无论是敌人的堡垒，还是漂亮的姑娘，都不能把我们阻挡”。真是气魄雄伟，打动人心。
    据说这些歌在匈牙利人民中是非常流行的，曾经起过号角作用。今天更可以唱起来去动员人民，保卫社会主义的匈牙利，严厉的打击反革命分子。甚至就是一些抒情的歌，如匈牙利古代民歌四首，俄罗斯民歌、舒莫吉地方民歌的第二首：“菲来特的好酒最出名，肥美的烤鸭在盘中，请大家痛快的喝一顿，我一点也不吝啬心疼”，其情绪也都是非常乐观的而又特具风趣的。合唱队在演唱这些歌曲的时候，常常是重来，而且合唱队一出现观众即报以暴风雨般的掌声。
    我不能不特别提到无伴奏合唱所演唱的俄罗斯民歌“伏尔加船夫曲”，我是一个在音乐方面浅学少见的人，在我所见和听到的这恐怕是唱得最好中的一个，11月15日那天晚上许多苏联专家都连声称赞，有的人甚至喊出“光荣”；谢幕五次。这个歌在我国各地演出，几乎都是这样的情形，观众曾一再要求重唱。从这个歌子的演唱中，也可以看出他们对俄罗斯人民悠久的传统艺术的热爱；而这是任何民族沙文主义的挑拨者所不能挑动的，且会在这种极能打动两个民族的良心，交流两个民族的感情的伟大艺术中被彻底粉碎。
    应该说合唱队是这个团最珍贵的一个组成部分。其特点是它有一个统一的音色，听不出一丝的杂音，无论是表现雄壮或者表现抒情的歌曲都是同样的和谐。他们能有这样的成绩，是因为在训练的时候就很注意；他们在招生的时候，不一定都要什么专科学校毕业学生。首要的一条就是声音的本质，要求发出同样的声音，一经选定即加以训练。他们已经训练了七年，匈牙利的伟大作曲家柯达伊曾经指导过他们。训练成熟以后，就要巩固大家爱这个团，所以团员很少变换，有些人看来岁数已经大了、老了，但他仍是十分安心于这个团。他们除了排演多种形式和内容的合唱外，有时还演歌剧；这就使得这个团一直保留着高度的合唱水平，而获得匈牙利国内和国外观众的爱好和称赞。毫无疑问的，他们在我国也将留下同样的影响。
    周总理在看完了他们演出并给他们讲话之后，合唱队也给周总理唱了“孔雀飞来”之歌来答谢周总理；他们说没有别的语言，只有用这个歌又来代替他们感谢的心情。周总理说：“你们坚决走社会主义的路，又有社会主义大家庭的帮助，你们所受的折磨很快就会过去的。”彭德怀副总理也特别称赞他们演出的丰富和民族特点。
    他们的舞蹈，同样具备着民族特色。使我最感兴趣的是每个舞差不多都有情节，而且又大多是载歌载舞。比方最纯朴的“瓷罐舞”，写一群乡下姑娘，愉快的捧着瓷罐跳舞，在观众看来不只是看到舞，同时听到了优美的民歌。这的确应该说是匈牙利歌舞的特点，特别值得我们学习。
    “兵营里的早晨”有着十分丰富的生活感，可以看出匈牙利士兵所过的朴素的生活；而同志间又是多么友爱团结。尽管其中还有嘲笑，但嘲笑却是善意的。
    “吉普赛舞”是以高度的技巧，结合丰富的吉普赛人的生活来演出的，极为动人和真实。
    其他如单项演出的钢琴、竖琴、女高音、男低音独唱都可以称得起是第一流的。
    我们能接待这一批继承了匈牙利民族文化传统，和歌颂社会主义匈牙利人民生活的艺术家是我们的光荣，对观众说实在是一个极大的享受。他们的国家正遭受着不幸后的破坏，坏分子还在乘机蠢动，因而我们在听他们的歌和看他们的舞的时候，更是以十分同情的心在看和听的，常常会不期然地同他们的歌舞中所表现的感情交流。我以为这是很自然的，这正是我们兄弟般的心情。社会主义大家庭就依靠大家都有这种心情，我们就可以相互学习，相互支持，取得胜利。因之，匈牙利人民军文工团在我国的这次访问演出，更具有特别意义。他们都表示，一定要把在中国所看到的和所感受到的带回匈牙利去，成为再建设社会主义匈牙利和匈牙利人民军的力量。而我们这些接待他们的人，正如周总理给他们说的：
    “中国人民永远同匈牙利人民在一起，支持社会主义的匈牙利！”
    这也就是每一个中国人民的心情。
