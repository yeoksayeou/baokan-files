    Forgot the Basic Principles
    The members of the handicraft cooperatives in Jining City, Shandong Province, lead a very hard life. The Qianjin Honglu Production Cooperative was established earlier and is larger in scale, but the wages of its members have been reduced repeatedly in recent years. In 1952, the highest wage for workers was eighty yuan, and the lowest was twenty-five yuan. Now, the highest is fifty yuan, and the lowest is only nineteen yuan. Members with many children don't even have enough to eat, and it's even harder to make ends meet when they get sick. Due to the decrease in income, many members have withdrawn from the cooperative this year.
    This is not because the cooperative's production is bad, but because the income distribution is unreasonable: 45% for the public accumulation fund, 10% for the education fund, 10% for welfare bonuses, 10% submitted for operating expenses, and only 25% distributed to the members. The purpose of cooperativization is to increase the income of the members and make their lives more prosperous. The leading comrades of the Jining City Handicraft Cooperative Federation have probably forgotten this basic principle.　Wei Yantang

    忘了基本原则
    山东省济宁市的手工业合作社社员生活很苦。前进红炉生产合作社建社较早，规模较大，可是几年来社员的工资一再降低。1952年工人最高工资是八十元，最少的二十五元，现在最高的五十元，最少的只有十九元。孩子多的社员连吃饭都不够，生了病就更没法维持。因为收入减少，今年以来，不少社员都退社了。
    这并不是合作社的生产不好，而是收入分配得不合理：公积金45％，教育基金10％，福利奖金10％，上缴事业费10％，给社员分配才占25％。合作化是为了使社员收入多，生活更加富裕。济宁市的手工业合作联社的领导同志恐怕是忘了这条基本原则了。　魏延堂
