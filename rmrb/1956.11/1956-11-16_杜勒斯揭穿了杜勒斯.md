    Dulles Exposes Dulles
    After the counter-revolutionary armed riot in Hungary, people naturally raised the question: Who was the mastermind behind this riot?
    Perhaps feeling guilty, American political figures immediately sensed countless suspicious eyes cast upon them after the Hungarian incident. Therefore, they deliberately pretended to have nothing to do with the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riot. At the end of last month, U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles mockingly "refuted" the claim that the United States was related to the Hungarian incident, calling it "absurd." U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson also chimed in for Dulles on the same day. He said, "He does not agree... with the notion that the Eisenhower administration instigated this rebellion," and declared, "We have nothing to do with it."
    However, a few days later, another Dulles, closely related to this Dulles, came out and exposed Dulles. The United Press International reported that at a secret meeting of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on November 12, someone asked Central Intelligence Agency Director Allen Dulles whether the United States knew in advance about the sudden developments in Poland and Hungary. … Allen Dulles said that, except for the exact date, he "knew everything about the riots in Poland and Hungary" in advance.
    Allen, in order to show off to Congress, actually forgot about his brother John. Although he only spoke a short sentence, it was much more important than John's lengthy diplomatic rhetoric, because it revealed the real and essential things.
    Now things are very clear: the Hungarian counter-revolutionary armed riot has a close relationship with the American intelligence agencies; a line connects the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries and Allen Dulles's bloody hands. Allen Dulles himself admitted this. Perhaps he did not expect that his sentence not only exposed his brother's shameless lies of defending America, but also exposed his own criminal acts.

### 杜勒斯揭穿了杜勒斯

    杜勒斯揭穿了杜勒斯
    在匈牙利发生反革命武装暴乱以后，人们自然而然地提出这样的问题：谁是这次暴乱事件的幕后策动者？
    也许是做贼心虚，美国的政界人物在匈牙利事件以后立刻感觉到有无数怀疑的眼光投向他们的身上来。因此他们就故意装出一付同匈牙利反革命暴乱事件毫无关系的样子。美国国务卿约翰·杜勒斯在上个月底以嘲讽的神气“驳斥”了指责美国同匈牙利事件有关的说法，认为这种说法是“荒唐”的。美国国防部长威尔逊也在同一天为杜勒斯帮腔。他说“他不同意……这次叛乱是艾森豪威尔政府促成的说法”，而且声明“我们同它毫无关系”。
    但是，过了不几天，同这个杜勒斯有密切关系的另一个杜勒斯就出来揭穿了杜勒斯。美国合众社报道，在美国参院外交委员会11月12日举行的一次秘密会议上，有人问中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯，美国是否在事先就知道波兰、匈牙利事件的突然发展。……艾伦·杜勒斯说，除了确切的日期以外，他在事先“就知道有关波兰和匈牙利的暴动的一切情况了。”
    艾伦为了向国会表功，竟忘记他的哥哥约翰了。他虽然只讲了短短的一句话，却比约翰连篇累牍的外交词令重要得多，因为它泄露了真实的主要的东西。
    现在事情已经很清楚了，匈牙利反革命暴乱事件同美国特务机关是有密切关系的，有一根线接连着匈牙利反革命分子和艾伦·杜勒斯的血手。艾伦·杜勒斯自己招认了这一点。也许他没有想到，他的这一句话不但揭穿了他哥哥为美国狡辩的无耻谎言，而且也揭穿了他自己的罪恶行径。
