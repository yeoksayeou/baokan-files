    There Were Originally Only Six Households There
    Lü Jianzhong
    The weather was clear, and I set off from Jiamusi to the state-owned Youyi Farm in Jixian County.
    The train left Jiamusi City and entered the delta formed by the confluence of the Heilongjiang, Songhua, and Ussuri Rivers. This is a fertile black plain, the main wheat-producing area of Heilongjiang Province. Soviet experts at Youyi Farm affectionately praised it as "China's Ukraine." Some passengers were gazing at the shimmering birch forests in the distance, while others were discussing the tremendous changes taking place in the "Great Northern Wilderness."
    The "Great Northern Wilderness" is a vast and rich place. It has dense forests and lush grasslands, nurturing dense herds of livestock and various rare birds and animals. It has abundant rainfall and extremely rich water resources. In addition to the Heilongjiang, Ussuri, Songhua, Mudanjiang, Nenjiang, and Suifen Rivers, more than 1,700 other rivers of all sizes are densely distributed throughout the region like veins. If these water resources are fully utilized, they can irrigate tens of millions of mu of paddy fields and dry land, and at the same time generate a large amount of electricity.
    I, a person entering the Northern Manchurian prairie for the first time, felt so comfortable and excited. I took out a map, searching for those fascinating places that I had heard about more than once in my childhood: the gold-filled Huma and Mohe, the primeval forest zone that resounded with logging sounds all year round, the beautiful mixed forests and exotic flowers and plants that made up the natural large garden on the banks of the Heilongjiang. …
    Sitting across from me was a very talkative old farmer wearing a sheepskin coat. He was going to a railway public security station to see his son. He leaned over and looked at the map in my hand with curious eyes, then asked me if there was a place called Shuangyagou on it? I couldn't find such a place, so I asked doubtfully: "Are you talking about Shuangyashan?" He immediately frowned, as if defending a wronged relative, and said: "No, no, Shuangyashan is very famous, I know that; I'm talking about Shuangyagou. Well, don't look down on that small mountain gully, I guarded it for thirty years!..."
    The train crossed a bridge, making a roaring sound, and I could hardly hear the last few words of the old man. I sensed that his unfinished words contained a history of blood and tears, just like the experiences of thousands upon thousands of poor people from my Shandong hometown who "闖關東" (migrated to Northeast China).
    Sure enough, after inquiring, he talked at length about his thirty years of experience in the "Great Northern Wilderness."
    The old man's surname was Fan, and his name was Fan Rongjiang. He came to Northeast China from Shouguang County, Shandong Province, in his twenties. He started by farming and fishing by Xingkai Lake. But years of labor did not free him from hunger. On a gloomy autumn night, a gang of local thugs raped and murdered his wife. So he took his two children and wandered to Luobei.
    Although Luobei was sparsely populated and overgrown with weeds at that time, as long as someone could sow seeds into that fertile black soil layer, whether it was wheat or soybeans, each hectare would yield at least one ton of grain a year. As for aquatic products, poultry, beasts, and various precious medicinal materials, they were everywhere. Local people used the proverb "beat roe deer with sticks and scoop fish with ladles, chickens and ducks fly into the rice pot" to describe its wealth. Fan Rongjiang settled down in a Shuangyagou full of wildflowers. There were only six households there, and they were as united as a family, living year after year with very little contact with the outside world. They not only had to work hard for food and clothing, but also had to fight against diseases and wild animals. For more than 20 years, they had been looking forward to people, looking forward to contact with the outside world and getting help, but no one cared about them, maybe no one even knew about them! Natural disasters and man-made calamities continued to attack them. Before the liberation of Northeast China, only three households remained. Disease took away Fan Rongjiang's beloved daughter, and his neighbor entrusted his daughter to him as a daughter-in-law before he died, and told them with tears in his eyes not to leave Shuangyagou, but to live well. They had a common belief: such a rich place would eventually be developed by someone.
    That day finally came. In the spring of 1955, the roar of engines from the mountains broke the silence of Shuangyagou. When they found out that it was the tractor station reclaiming wasteland for a large number of immigrants, and heard that the state would turn the "Great Northern Wilderness," which had been sleeping for thousands of years, completely over in the three five-year plans, they were overjoyed. Fan Rongjiang went home and lifted his three-year-old grandson to the top of his head, murmuring: "Fugen, your good times have come!"
    Fan Rongjiang spoke, gesticulating, his emotions were agitated, his expression was cheerful, and he attracted all the passengers around him.
    The train let out a loud roar, and the Fulitun station arrived. I transferred from here to Youyi Farm by car. I shook Fan Rongjiang's hand tightly and said goodbye reluctantly.
    After that, the old man Fan Rongjiang's shadow often appeared in my mind. Luobei has also become a place that is particularly easy to evoke my inner feelings. I constantly learned from the newspapers and from the letters of the reclamation team members I was familiar with that Luobei was changing its appearance day by day. This year, hundreds of thousands of young reclamation team members from all over the motherland stepped into the Northern Manchurian prairie, holding high the red flag of "marching toward difficulties." More than 30 collective farms have been established in the Luobei reclamation area alone. Recently, they have already obtained the first great harvest from their newly reclaimed more than 30,000 hectares of land.
    The good times that people in the Northern Manchurian prairie have been looking forward to for many years have indeed arrived!

    那里原先只有六户人家
    吕建中
    天气晴朗，我从佳木斯动身到集贤县境内的国营友谊农场。
    列车开出佳木斯市，就穿入由黑龙江、松花江、乌苏里江汇流夹成的三角洲，这是一片肥沃的黑色原野，是黑龙江省主要的产小麦地区，友谊农场的苏联专家们亲切地赞美她是“中国的乌克兰”。旅客们有的在眺望远处闪耀着的桦树林，有的在谈论“北大荒”正经历着的巨大变革。
    “北大荒”，这是个非常辽阔、富庶的地方。这里有茂密的森林和肥美的草原，她养育着稠密的畜群和各种珍禽异兽；这里雨量充沛，水利资源极其丰富，除了黑龙江、乌苏里江以外，松花江、牡丹江、嫩江、绥芬河以及其它大小一千七百多条河流像脉络似地密布全境。如果把这些水利资源充分利用起来，可以灌溉几千万亩的水田和旱田，同时还可以发出大量的电力来。
    我，一个初次踏进北满草原的人，心境是那样舒畅、激动。我拿出地图，寻找着我童年时代就不止一次地听说过的那些迷人的地方：那遍地黄金的呼玛和漠河，那终年沸腾着伐木声响的原始林带，那美丽的混合林和奇花异草构成了天然大花园的黑龙江滨。……
    坐在我对面的是一个很喜欢讲话的、穿一件翻毛皮袄的老农民，他是要到一个铁路公安派出所去看他的儿子。他探过来身子，用好奇的眼神打量着我手里的地图，然后问我这上边可有个双鸦沟？我找不见有这样一个地方，便怀疑地问道：“您说的是双鸭山吧？”他立刻皱一皱眉，像是给一个受了委屈的亲人辩护似地说：“不，不是，双鸭山很有名，这我知道；我说的是双鸦沟。嗯，别看不起那个小山坳啊，我守了它整整三十年！……
    火车穿过一座桥梁，发出轰隆的声响，老汉后面的几句话几乎听不清楚了。我预感到他那没有说完的话里包含着一段血泪史，就像我山东家乡千千万万个“闯关东”的穷苦人们所遭遇过的那样。
    果然，经过探问，他滔滔不绝地述说起他在“北大荒”的三十年的经历。
    这老汉姓樊，叫樊荣江。二十几岁就从山东寿光县到了东北。开始在兴凯湖边种地，也打过鱼。可是终年劳动并没有使他摆脱饥饿。在一个阴霾的秋夜，当地一伙恶棍奸污并且杀害了他的妻子。于是他又带着一双儿女流浪到萝北。
    萝北这地方当时虽然人烟稀少，荒草丛生，可是只要有人能把种子播进那肥沃的黑土层，不管是小麦还是大豆，每垧地一年至少也收一吨粮食。至于那里水产、禽兽以及各种珍贵的药材更是俯拾皆是，当地人们用“棒打獐子瓢舀鱼，鸡鸭飞到饭锅里”的谚语形容她的富庶。樊荣江在一道开满了野花的双鸦沟住下来，那里只有六户人家，他们团结得像一家人，年复一年地过着和外界极少来往的日子。他们不仅要为衣食而辛勤劳动，而且要同疾病和野兽进行搏斗。二十多年来，他们一直望眼欲穿地盼望着人，盼望着和外界接触得到援助，可是从没有人关心过他们，也许根本就没有人知道他们呢！天灾人祸却不断地向他们袭击，东北临解放前，他们只剩下了三户。疾病夺去了樊荣江心爱的女儿，他的邻居临死的时候把女儿托付给他做儿媳，并含着眼泪嘱咐他们不要离开双鸦沟，要好好地过下去。他们有着一个共同的信念：像这样富庶的地方，早晚总会有人来开辟她。
    这一天终于来了，1955年春天，山岭那边发动机的轰响，突破了沉寂的双鸦沟。当他们探听明白那是拖拉机站在给大批移民开垦荒地，并且听说国家在三个五年计划期内，就要把这沉睡了几千年的“北大荒”全部翻一个个儿的时候，他们欢欣若狂了。樊荣江回家把三岁的孙儿举到头顶上，喃喃地说：“福根，你们的好时光来到了！”
    樊荣江说着，比划着，他情绪激动，神采开朗，他吸引住了身边所有的旅客。
    列车拉开嗓子吼叫一声，福利屯车站到了。我从这里换乘汽车到友谊农场。我紧握着樊荣江的手，依依告别。
    这以后，樊荣江老汉的影子时常在我脑际里出现。萝北，也成了特别容易唤起我的内心情感的地方，我不断地从报纸上，从我所熟悉的垦荒队员们的来信中知道，萝北在日新月异地改变着她的面貌。今年祖国各地有十几万青年垦荒队员高举着“向困难进军”的大红旗踏进了北满草原，光萝北垦区就建立了三十多个集体农庄，最近，他们已经从自己新开垦的三万多公顷的土地上获得了第一个大丰收。
    北满草原上人们多年来盼望着的好时光确实来到了！
