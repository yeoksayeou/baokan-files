Xinhua News Agency, Linxia, November 21st. A grand gathering was held in Linxia City on the 20th to celebrate the establishment of the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture. More than 40,000 people participated in the conference, including workers, farmers, and students of the Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups, Hui women wearing various colored velvet headscarves and brightly colored cotton robes, and imams and mullahs from mosques. Many Hui and Han farmers from more than a hundred miles away also arrived early to attend the conference. In Ga'xinj, Linxia County, an area where Hui-Han ethnic clashes have occurred many times in the past century, many Hui and Han members rode together in large carts, joyfully and excitedly arriving at the venue.

Joining the masses in the celebration were the newly elected Governor of the Autonomous Prefecture, responsible cadres of the Linxia Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and several hundred representatives of various ethnic groups who had come to attend the People's Representative Assembly of the Autonomous Prefecture. Gan Chunlei, Director of the General Office of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, and Chen Chengyi, Vice Governor of Gansu Province, also attended the celebration.

On this day, Linxia City was decorated with lanterns and streamers everywhere, and the masses performed programs on the streets. The Han people also joined the Hui people in the Bafang district, where the Hui people live, in a joint celebration. An 88-year-old Hui elder in Linxia City personally wrote a letter to Chairman Mao and handed over an ancient bottle that had been passed down in his family for hundreds of years to Gan Chunlei, asking him to forward it to Chairman Mao. Han Yulin, a 59-year-old woman from the Chengdong District skilled in embroidery, meticulously embroidered a "Pine, Crane, and Deer" tablecloth to present to Chairman Mao, wishing him boundless longevity. The Young Pioneers of the Bafang Hui Girls' Primary School also presented Chairman Mao with a silk banner with large characters embroidered by themselves with their own wisdom: "Thank you for your care and nurturing."

In the evening, the entire street was ablaze with thousands of colored flags and lanterns, and torches illuminated the scene. The people of all ethnic groups were immersed in joy until late at night.
