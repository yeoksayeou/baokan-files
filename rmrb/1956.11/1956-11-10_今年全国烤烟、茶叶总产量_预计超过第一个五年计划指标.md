    This Year's National Total Output of Flue-Cured Tobacco and Tea
    Expected to Exceed the Targets of the First Five-Year Plan
    Xinhua News Agency, 9th. According to preliminary estimates from the Ministry of Agriculture, the total national output of flue-cured tobacco and tea this year has exceeded the original production plan; and both have completed and exceeded the 1957 production targets ahead of schedule.
    It is understood that Yunnan Province's flue-cured tobacco output this year has increased more than threefold compared to last year. Shandong Province's flue-cured tobacco, calculated by harvested area, has an average yield of 219 jin per mu, creating the highest average unit yield in history. Shandong, Yunnan, and other provinces have also seen many high-yield cooperatives and townships with yields of 400 to 700 jin of flue-cured tobacco per mu.
    This year, many famous export tea varieties, such as "Ao Hong," "Min Hong," "Chuan Hong," "Qi Hong," and "Wu Lv" and other high-grade teas, have also increased production compared to last year. Due to the timely harvesting and processing of summer and autumn tea, the output of summer and autumn tea in some areas has increased by 30% to 50% compared to last year.
    The state's vigorous support for tea and flue-cured tobacco producing area farmers, the emphasis placed on the production of these economic crops by Party and government leading organs and agricultural departments in various producing areas, and the promotion of advanced cultivation techniques are the main reasons for the bumper harvest of flue-cured tobacco and tea this year.

    今年全国烤烟、茶叶总产量
    预计超过第一个五年计划指标
    新华社9日讯　据农业部初步预计，今年全国烤烟和茶叶的总产量都超过了原定的生产计划；并且都提前和超额完成了1957年的生产指标。
    据了解，云南省今年烤烟比去年增产了三倍多。山东省全省烤烟按收获面积计算，平均亩产二百十九斤，创造了历史上平均单位产量的最高纪录。山东、云南等省还出现了不少亩产四百斤到七百斤烤烟的丰产社和丰产乡。
    今年许多著名的外销茶类，如澳红、闽红、川红、祁红和婺绿等高级茶，也都比去年增产。由于及时进行了夏茶、秋茶的采制工作，部分地区的夏秋茶的产量比去年提高了30％到50％以上。
    国家对茶叶和烤烟产区农民的大力扶助，各产区党政领导机关和农业部门对这些经济作物生产的重视，以及先进栽培技术的推广，是今年烤烟、茶叶获得丰产的主要原因。
