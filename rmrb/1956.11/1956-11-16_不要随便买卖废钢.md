    Do Not Arbitrarily Buy and Sell Scrap Steel

    Scrap steel is one of the materials allocated uniformly by the state. The state has long stipulated that private buying, selling, transferring, or gifting is not allowed. The State Planning Commission once stipulated that scrap steel from various industrial ministries, transportation, fuel, and other departments of the central government should be purchased and supplied by the Metal Recycling Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry; scrap steel from other central ministries and local state-owned enterprises should be purchased by each province and city for reasonable allocation.

    However, some units, using the excuse of "utilizing waste materials," sell scrap steel to units that should not be acquiring it, preventing the state's planned scrap steel acquisition tasks from being completed as scheduled, seriously affecting the scrap steel supply for steel smelting enterprises. For example, the Shanghai Shipyard under the Ministry of Communications had only completed 64% of its scrap steel submission task by the end of August this year. On September 18th, they even took dozens of tons of scrap steel to exchange for steel materials from the Jiangsu Provincial Handicraft Production Cooperative at a ratio of two to one. This factory still has over one hundred tons of scrap steel, which they are delaying handing over under the pretext of needing to utilize it. A factory in Shanghai under the First Ministry of Machine Building privately sold scrap steel eighty-nine times over three months from May to July, selling a total of six hundred and twelve parts and over twenty thousand catties of other scrap steel. The Shanghai Purchasing Station of the Materials Management Bureau under the Ministry of Construction Engineering sold hundreds of tons of scrap steel to the Jiangxi Provincial Handicraft Cooperative in September. Later, because some scrap steel was too large to handle, it was transferred to the Shanghai Office of the Recycling Bureau, wasting a lot of manpower and resources. The above are just a few examples. In fact, the phenomenon of privately buying, selling, or exchanging scrap steel exists in other regions and units, disrupting the planned recycling and use of scrap steel. Of course, due to the shortage of steel and difficulties in supply, it is correct for some units to use scrap materials to replace good materials. But using the utilization of waste materials as an excuse not to hand over what should be handed over, keeping it in one's own unit, or selling it is wrong.

### 不要随便买卖废钢

    不要随便买卖废钢
    废钢铁是国家统一分配物资之一，国家早有规定不许私自买卖、转让、赠送。国家计划委员会曾规定，中央各工业部、交通运输、燃料等部门的废钢，统由冶金工业部金属回收管理局收购和供应；中央其他部和地方国营企业由各省市收购，以便合理分配。
    但有些单位却借口“利用废料”把废钢铁出售给不应该收购的单位，使国家规定的废钢收购任务不能按计划完成，严重影响了钢铁冶炼企业的废钢供应。例如交通部所属上海船厂到今年8月底止，只完成废钢上交任务64％，9月18日他们竟拿出几十吨废钢向江苏省手工业生产合作社按二比一的办法调换钢材。这个厂尚存有一百多吨废钢也借口要利用迟迟不肯上交。第一机械工业部所属上海某厂，在5至7月份的三个月里私自卖废钢八十九次，共卖出六百一十二个部件和两万多斤其他废钢。建筑工程部所属器材管理局上海采购站，9月份曾售给江西省手工业合作社废钢达数百吨之多，后来因为有些废钢体积太大处理不了又转交给了回收管理局上海办事处，往返浪费了很多人力财力。上面说的，只是几个例子，事实上私自买卖或调换废钢铁的现象，其他地区和其他单位也有，这样就打乱了废钢铁的按计划回收和使用。当然由于钢材不足、供应上有困难，有些单位利用废材代替好材，是对的，但把利用废料当作借口，应上交的不交，存在本单位或者拿出去卖掉，就不对了。
