Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 22nd. Shandong Province's highway transportation is experiencing an exceptionally busy peak season. On major highways such as Yantai-Weifang, Zhangdian-Beizhen, and Linyi-Yanzhou, trucks and rubber-wheeled carts, fully loaded with peanuts, cotton, and various local and special products, are traveling day and night towards railway lines and coastal ports. Upon their return, they are loaded with various industrial products. On mountain roads, there are also more vehicles than usual loaded with supplies.

This year, Shandong Province has achieved unprecedented bumper harvests of grain, cotton, and peanuts, and the export volume of various local products has also increased significantly. Due to the good harvests, the rural areas' need for industrial products is much greater than in previous years. To adapt to this situation, Shandong Province's transportation departments have been paying attention to tapping the potential of transportation from all aspects. Since October, six transportation branch companies in Qingdao, Yantai, Weifang, Linyi, Jining, and Liaocheng have successively implemented double-shift transportation for automobiles, and currently 300 vehicles are participating in double-shift transportation. The transportation companies have also changed the method of low-speed continuous gliding of automobiles, increasing the speed of the automobiles. This item alone is equivalent to increasing the transportation capacity of 277 vehicles. In addition, dozens of large trailers with a load capacity of three tons, which are being rushed to manufacture by the Department of Transportation, will also participate in transportation soon.

While tapping the potential of automobile transportation, all localities are also paying attention to organizing and utilizing civilian transportation forces. By mid-November, in addition to the more than 6,100 rubber-wheeled carts of various transportation professional cooperatives, 35,000 vehicles from agricultural producers' cooperatives have also participated in transportation.

    旺季货物多公路运输忙
    新华社济南22日电　山东省公路运输出现了旺季特旺的现象。烟
  （台）潍（坊）、张（店）北（镇）和临（沂）兖（州）等主要公路干线上，满载花生，棉花和各种土特产品的汽车，胶轮大车，正在昼夜不停地向铁路沿线和沿海港口行驶；而在车辆回来的时候，又载上了各种工业品。在山区大道上，也出现了比平常更多的满载物资的车辆。
    今年山东省粮食、棉花和花生都获得空前丰收，各种土产品的外运量也有显著增加。由于丰收，农村对工业品的需要量也比往年多得多。山东省交通运输部门为了适应这种情况，已经注意从各方面来挖掘运输的潜在力量。从10月份开始，青岛、烟台、潍坊、临沂、济宁和聊城等六个运输分公司都陆续实行了汽车双班运输，参加双班运输的汽车目前已经有三百辆。各运输公司还改变汽车低速连续滑行的办法，提高了汽车的时速。单是这一项就相当于增加了二百七十七辆汽车的运输能力。另外，交通厅正在赶制的几十辆载重三吨的大拖车，最近也将参加运输。
    在挖掘汽车运输潜力的同时，各地还注意组织和运用民间运输力量。到11月中旬，全省参加运输的除了各运输专业合作社的六千一百多辆胶轮马车以外，还有三万五千辆农业生产合作社的车辆。
