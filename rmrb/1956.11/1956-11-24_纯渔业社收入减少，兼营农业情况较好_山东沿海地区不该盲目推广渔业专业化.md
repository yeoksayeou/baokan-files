Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd. (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Chen Yuming): Shandong Province's coastal areas are blindly promoting fishery specialization, resulting in decreased income for some fishery production cooperatives.

In the past, most fishermen in Shandong's coastal areas owned some land, and income from the land was always one of the sources of livelihood for the fishermen. However, since the autumn of last year, when the upsurge of the fishery collectivization movement began, some local organizations of the Chinese Communist Party in the coastal areas demanded that fishery cooperatives implement "specialization" and establish "pure fishery cooperatives," turning the land over to nearby agricultural cooperatives for operation. They believed that specialization would enable fishery cooperatives to concentrate on fishery operations, thereby increasing fish production, without considering the specific conditions of fishery production at the time. At that time, the Shandong Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau, after discovering this situation, felt that the practice of promoting fishery specialization was not appropriate, but they did not conduct further investigation and research to put forward affirmative opinions and suggest that the Party committee correct this practice, but adopted an attitude of letting it go. As a result, according to incomplete statistics, among the province's 806 fishery cooperatives, 233 handed over their land. The vast majority of these cooperatives that handed over their land, with the exception of a very small number that achieved particularly good harvests, saw a decrease in their total income compared to last year. Among the 204 households in the Shuangdao Fishery Cooperative in Weihai City, each household received an average of 204 yuan in fishery income and more than 1,100 jin of grain last year. From January to October this year, each household received an average of 230 yuan in fishery income. Although fishery income increased compared to last year, the total income of the vast majority of members decreased compared to last year because they no longer had agricultural income. The Weiguo Fishery Cooperative in the suburbs of Qingdao received more than 310,000 jin of grain last year. After merging into an advanced cooperative at the end of last year, all the land was handed over to the agricultural cooperative. In addition, fishery income decreased compared to last year. This year, the average income of each household decreased by 41% compared to last year. It is understood that currently, about 16% of the total number of fishing households in the province are experiencing financial difficulties, and most of these fishermen are members of pure fishery cooperatives. In contrast, the income situation of members in fishery cooperatives that also engaged in agriculture was better. The Youhao Fishery Cooperative in Rizhao County had a fishery income of more than 570,000 yuan this year, and also received more than 400,000 jin of grain. The members said: "This year is a double harvest of fishery and agriculture, with grain to eat and money to spend." Although the fishery income of the Shuguang Fishery Cooperative in Yantai City was less than last year, the average member household received 2,500 jin of sweet potatoes alone.

The Shandong Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau has recently studied this situation again and believes that at present, fishery production tools and production technology are still relatively backward, and production is unstable. Therefore, fishery cooperatives that engage in a variety of agricultural and sideline production should be vigorously promoted in large quantities according to local conditions. In this way, on the one hand, it can ensure that the vast majority of members increase their income, and on the other hand, it can also give full play to the labor potential of the members, improve labor productivity, and avoid idleness during the off-season. At the same time, fishery cooperatives engaging in agricultural and sideline production can also support each other economically, which is conducive to the development of various productions. Therefore, they believe that at present, it is necessary to conscientiously summarize and promote the experience of combining fishery and agriculture, and study and solve the specific policies in combining fishery and agriculture, in order to guide fishery cooperatives to carry out diversified operations.

### 纯渔业社收入减少，兼营农业情况较好  山东沿海地区不该盲目推广渔业专业化

    纯渔业社收入减少，兼营农业情况较好
    山东沿海地区不该盲目推广渔业专业化
    据新华社济南23日电　新华社记者陈雨明报道：山东省沿海地区盲目推行渔业专业化，使部分渔业生产合作社收入减少。
    山东省沿海渔民，过去大部分都有一些土地，土地收入一直是渔民们的生活来源之一。但是，从去年秋季进入渔业合作化运动高潮以后，中共在沿海地区的一些地方组织要求渔业社实行“专业化”、办
  “纯渔业社”，把土地交给附近的农业社经营。他们认为，实行专业化，可以使渔业社集中力量经营渔业，从而提高鱼产量，而没有考虑到目前渔业生产的各项具体条件。当时，山东省水产局发现这一情况后，曾经感到推行渔业专业化的做法不够妥当，但是他们没有通过进一步的调查研究，提出肯定的意见，并建议党委纠正这种做法，而采取了放任不管的态度。结果，据不完全统计，在全省的八百零六个渔业社中，有二百三十三个社交出了土地。这些交出了土地的渔业社，除了极少数获得特殊丰收的社以外，绝大多数社的总收入都比去年减少。威海市双岛渔业社的二百零四户社员中，去年每户平均得到渔业收入二百零四元、粮食一千一百多斤，今年1月到10月，每户平均得到渔业收入二百三十元，渔业收入虽然比去年增加了，但是由于没有了农业收入，绝大多数社员的总收入都比去年减少了。青岛市郊的卫国渔业社，去年收入粮食三十一万多斤，去年年底并成高级社以后，土地全部交给了农业社，再加渔业收入比去年减少，今年每户社员的平均收入比去年减少了41％。据了解，现在全省有占总渔户16％左右的渔民，生活发生困难，这些渔民大部分是纯渔业社的社员。与此相反，在兼营农业的渔业社里，社员收入情况就比较好。日照县友好渔业社今年渔业收入五十七万多元，另外还收入了四十多万斤粮食，社员们说：“今年是渔农双丰收，有粮吃、有钱花。”烟台市曙光渔业社虽然今年渔业收入比去年要少，但是仅甘薯一项，平均每户社员就分了二千五百斤。
    山东省水产局最近又专门研究了这方面的情况，认为目前渔业生产工具、生产技术还比较落后，生产不稳定，因此，应该因地制宜地大量提倡兼作农副业多种生产的渔业社。这样，一方面可以保证绝大多数社员增加收入，另一方面，也可以充分发挥社员的劳动潜力，提高劳动生产率，避免渔汛淡季的窝工现象，同时，渔业社兼营农副业生产，还可以在经济上互相接济，以利于各种生产的发展。因此，他们认为当前应当认真总结推广渔农结合的经验，研究解决渔农结合中的各项具体政策，以指导渔业社开展多种经营。
