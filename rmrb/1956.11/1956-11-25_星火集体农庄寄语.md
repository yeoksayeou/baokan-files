Messages from the Spark Collective Farm
By our reporter Lü Jianzhong

    Some time ago, the members of the Spark Collective Farm sent me a letter. The letter began by saying: "Since our last contact with you on the phone, there have been serious changes in the production of our farm. A major flood inundated more than one hundred hectares of our best rice, and the remaining three hundred hectares of rice also suffered from rice blast..."

    To be honest, I felt a little discouraged when I read this. Just over twenty days ago, they told me loudly on the phone: "You can start writing now, our farm's rice is growing very well, and it seems we are sure to complete the plan of 12,000 jin per hectare..."

    The farmers have long held feelings for those who care about them. Since the news of this farm as China's first collective farm appeared in the People's Daily in 1951, letters from people all over the country expressing encouragement and love have never ceased. They gave their farm a meaningful name—"Spark," expressing their deep belief that this spark would become a prairie fire. It is precisely to be faithful to this ideal that they have been constantly creating miracles in production over the years. The income per workday of the farm members has risen from three yuan in 1951 to four yuan and five yuan in 1955—this year their original plan was to earn five yuan and six jiao per workday, and they hoped to use this to explain to the peasant brothers across the country the path they should take. During the high tide of agricultural cooperation across the country, they received even more letters, and the content of the letters was even more touching. When I visited them this spring, they brought out several boxes of letters for me to read. These letters came from soldiers, workers, teachers, students, and composers, and of course, more were from the thousands upon thousands of peasants who had already joined fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives. They asked the farm members to introduce some "most valuable experiences" and wanted to know what kind of life the members of the Spark Collective Farm, as "pioneers," were now living.

    Farm Chairman Jin Baishan and Branch Secretary Li Zaigen repeatedly told me that they were very anxious and sorry, and that it was difficult for them to reply to each letter individually. They naturally thought of the People's Daily, which first introduced their deeds to the people of the whole country. As a reporter, I also felt it was a very pleasant thing to accept their commission.

    What should I convey to the readers? The leaders of the farm introduced me to some aspects of the farm's management: In recent years, they have indeed made a lot of achievements in production management, labor management, financial management, and the Party branch leading the farm members to fight against various kinds of individualism and conservative thinking, and have accumulated a relatively complete set of experiences. Taking quota management as an example, they have already implemented one hundred kinds of quotas in the past, and this year they will implement another one hundred kinds. In this way, almost everything that can be implemented with quotas is included.

    There have also been many achievements in implementing the policy of running the community democratically and thriftily. For example, in the past, the production plan of the village was not discussed by the villagers, and everyone was not aware of the production expenses. The villagers only thought about how many yuan they would get for one workday after the autumn harvest, and then estimated their annual income, and pre-paid and received various daily necessities from the farm. Many villagers did not pay attention to quality when working, and even asked the farm for a broom in their lives. The most typical thing was that last year, the Jiamusi Pharmaceutical Company came to the farm to promote deer antler ginseng pills, which cost twenty-four yuan per jin. The villagers felt that the farm would pay for it anyway, so they ate it first. More than one hundred jin of deer antler ginseng pills were snapped up. By the end of the year, many villagers had overspent, and the farm spent more than 20,000 yuan on medical expenses alone. This year, after the plan was fully discussed by the villagers, everyone understood the benefits of running the community thriftily and came up with many good ideas. For example, accumulating more farm manure instead of chemical fertilizers, implementing direct dry seeding for all rice (watering the rice fields after sowing), irrigating reasonably in stages and quantitatively, rewarding technology for evaluating work points, saving labor to reclaim wasteland and engage in sideline occupations, and ensuring that production expenses and villagers' advances do not exceed the prescribed "defense line," etc. Originally, the farm was going to buy two cars, but after a debate among the villagers, they changed to buying twenty-seven horses and twelve rubber-wheeled carts. This not only saved more than 10,000 yuan in expenses, but also was more suitable for the needs of the farm.

    The farm's leading comrades also led me to visit the farm's various facilities, such as threshing machines, rice milling machines, farm tool repair shops, broadcasting rooms, clubs, nurseries, canteens, and various semi-mechanized agricultural machines, etc., all of which were available. Six rice milling machines can produce 70,000 jin of rice per day and night. The two threshing machines with their necks stretched out outside the door of the rice milling plant were installed by the farm's technicians themselves. To the west of the threshing ground are spacious pigsties and livestock sheds, with a total of one hundred and fifty-two cattle and horses and one hundred and twenty pigs. The total public property of the entire farm is worth about 250,000 yuan. As long as you know that this was just a puddle seven or eight years ago, you can imagine how amazing the labor the villagers have put in here!

    As for the current living standards of the farm members, that is obvious at a glance. Just take the family of Jin Baishan, the chairman of the farm, as an example. He has a capable wife and two children. In the past few years, the family's net income has been more than 1,500 yuan per year, and has reached a maximum of 2,000 yuan. They live in a Korean-style house designed and built by the farm for the villagers three years ago. As soon as you enter the door, there is a bookcase on the kang, a large wall mirror, and two very chic beige wardrobes and quilt cabinets side by side. Open the sliding partition opposite the glass window to reveal a very clean small kitchen with a water pump well, a glass bowl cabinet, and three round Korean pots neatly embedded in the cement countertop. I stayed on this large kang with seven people, including Deputy Governor Yu Jie of Heilongjiang Province. I was worried that everyone would not have brought luggage and would cause trouble for the farm, but at night Jin Baishan opened the door of the quilt cabinet and kept pulling out colorful quilts. His family had all the luggage that we people needed to cover ourselves with.

    Jin Baishan's family life is considered to be above average in the farm. I have also visited several other families, and the situation is similar. Just take Li Zhenshu, the female villager next door to Jin Baishan who has a relatively poor life, she also has the ability to support a pair of children to go to middle school, and eats high-quality rice with two or three dishes for each meal. She is one of the most outstanding laborers among the women of the farm. The night I visited the old villager Du Zaiyan, he was listening to Korean songs on the radio with his children on the kang. He said that he bought the radio because he couldn't read the newspaper, and he liked listening to international affairs the most. This old villager, who worked as a long-term worker for thirty years in the old society, once created a "double-handed rice cutting method," which made rice cutting efficiency twice as high as others. He sincerely taught the technology to others, and some villagers surpassed him after learning the technology, but he was so happy that he couldn't sleep at night. He humbly said to me: "I have no good experience to contribute to the peasant brothers who care about us, I only feel that without the farm, there would be no me!"

    I can't write down all the words that the villagers asked me to convey to the readers, but I still have to write about an old villager named Jiang Dongxun: long eyebrows, red face, a tuft of golden yellow mustache, and very humorous when he speaks. He is now supporting three older children to go to school, one of whom is even a college student. Others say that he has a lot of experience and want him to introduce some "valuable experience" to the peasant brothers who wrote letters. He thought for a while and smiled softly: "Experience, don't do anything that is sorry for the farm." He scratched his scalp and added, "You will regret it if you do." I didn't understand what he meant and asked him to explain it specifically. He seemed a little embarrassed, just squinting his eyes and repeating, "The happiest! The farm gives it." It wasn't until the next day that the villagers told me an interesting story about him:

    He didn't join when the farm was first established, saying that he had a family of ten, big and small, with only two broken quilts, and he was too afraid of poverty to take risks. His wife often attended meetings and was more progressive than him. Later, she finally mobilized him to join. However, he was always worried, afraid of earning too few points and the whole family starving. Once, when he was plowing the field with an ox, he wanted to plow faster and earn more points, so he desperately beat the ox, and in a fit of anger, he crippled the ox. He felt that it was the farm's ox anyway, so he didn't feel bad and secretly went to the livestock farm to exchange it for another one. He thought that this matter would be over as long as no one knew about it. Unexpectedly, at a villager meeting to criticize employment views, his wife exposed him. At that time, he just stood there with his mouth open, unable to say a word. From then on, he resented his wife in his heart. His wife explained the truth to him several times, but he curled his beard and said, "You turn your elbows outward, you, hum!" In the autumn, the farm's rice was harvested, and he did not expect that he would be allocated more than 20,000 jin of rice, which was three or four times higher than his income when he worked alone. He was so happy that he felt deeply ashamed. So he apologized to his wife and automatically ran to the farm management committee to make a review. From then on, whenever he mentioned the benefits of the farm, he regretted doing that thing that was sorry for the farm. After listening to this story, I realized the true meaning of his two sentences, which can be regarded as a "valuable experience" to introduce to peasant brothers who have just joined the community!

    On the morning I was leaving the farm, the neat streets of the farm were filled with golden sunshine. The square in front of the threshing ground was noisy with people, and the welders were repairing the sowing machines nervously. Li Zaigen and I climbed onto a haystack next to a tall transformer bracket, overlooking the irrigation station, tractor station, and the manure transport teams coming and going on the field roads on the edge of the Songhua River. Li Zaigen opened his small notebook, counting the number of villagers participating in manure accumulation that day, and said to me: "You see, this small section of production arrangement was just broadcast last night, and today the villagers have all taken action. As long as there are no irresistible accidental disasters, we will definitely fight against difficulties and report good news of the harvest to everyone in the autumn."

    After parting, I missed them all the time, and I constantly heard about their hard efforts in the process of striving for a bumper rice harvest. The people of the whole country encouraged them to strive for a bumper harvest; and they reported good news of the harvest to the people of the whole country, which was really great. But I didn't expect that they would suddenly encounter a flood...

    I took their letter, recalling all this. Later, I continued to read:

    "...Although we suffered an unexpected disaster, we did not lose confidence in production and disaster relief. We thought: We have overthrown the old society, how can we be frightened by this little flood? We first check our subjective shortcomings... and think of all ways to prepare for next year's production. We have also sent out three sideline production teams—logging teams, transportation teams, and fishing teams. Old villagers Du Zaiyan and Jiang Dongxun have all rolled up their sleeves and gone to the mountains to log. Li Zhenshu and all the women have taken on the autumn harvest of the farm. We resolutely implement the policy of production for self-salvation and thriftily running the community, and strive to earn more than two yuan per workday..."

    After reading the letter, I laughed at myself again. The villagers are so motivated, but I was discouraged. I heard that some villagers in other disaster-stricken communities lack confidence in production and self-salvation, and some only want to rely on government relief. Then, the optimistic attitude and spirit of overcoming difficulties of the members of the Spark Collective Farm may be an encouragement to them.

    星火集体农庄寄语
    本报记者　吕建中
    前些日子，星火集体农庄的庄员们给我寄来一封信，信上一开头就说：“自从上次和你在电话上联系之后，我们农庄生产有了严重的变化，一场大洪水把一百多垧最好的稻子淹没了，其余三百多垧水稻也发生了稻热病。……”
    说实话，当时我读到这里真有点泄气。二十多天前，他们在电话里大声告诉我说：“你可以动笔啦，我们农庄的稻子长得非常好，看来完成每垧一万二千斤的计划是有把握的。……”
    庄员们对于关心他们的人的感情是由来已久的，自从1951年这个农庄作为我国第一个集体农庄的事迹在人民日报上出现以后，全国人民对他们表示鼓励、爱戴的来信从没有间断过；而他们也就给自己的农庄取下一个意义深长的名子——“星火”，表示自己深信这星星之火会变成燎原的火焰。也正是为了忠实于自己这个理想，他们几年来不断地在生产上创造奇迹，农庄每个劳动日的收入从1951年到1955年，一直由三元上升到四元、五元——今年他们的原计划是每个劳动日收入五元六角，他们希望以此向全国农民兄弟说明自己应该走的道路。在全国农业合作化高潮当中，他们收到的来信更多，信的内容也就更感动人了。今年春天我去访问他们的时候，他们抱出几箱子信来给我看。这些来信的有战士、有工人，还有教师、学生和作曲家，当然更多的还是那成千上万已经加入了完全社会主义农业生产合作社的农民，他们要求庄员们给介绍点“最宝贵的经验”，希望知道做为“开路先锋”的星火集体农庄的庄员们现在过着什么样的生活。
    农庄主席金白山和支部书记李在根同志几次向我表示他们很着急也很抱歉，他们很难对来信一一执笔作复。他们很自然地想到了首先把他们的事迹介绍给全国人民的人民日报。我做为一个记者，接受他们的委托也感到是一件很愉快的事。
    向读者转达些什么呢？农庄的领导人曾向我介绍了一些农庄管理方面的情况：几年来，他们在生产管理、劳动管理、财务管理以及党支部领导庄员向各色各样个人主义、保守思想做斗争等方面，确实作出不少成绩，并积累了一套比较完整的经验。就拿定额管理来说，他们过去已经实行了一百种定额，今年还要再实行一百种。这样凡是可以实行定额的差不多都包括进去了。
    在贯彻实行民主办社勤俭办社方针方面也有不少成就。比方说，过去庄里的生产计划不经庄员讨论，生产开支情况大家都不摸底，庄员脑子里光想着秋后一个劳动日分几元钱，再估量自己的一年所得，向农庄预支、领取各种日用品。不少庄员干活不讲质量，而生活上连一把扫帚也伸手向农庄要。最典型的一件事就是去年佳木斯医药公司到农庄推销鹿茸人参丸，每斤二十四元，庄员们觉得反正先由农庄付钱，吃了再说，一百多斤鹿茸人参丸一抢而空。到年底不少庄员超支了，农庄光医药费就开支了两万多元。今年订计划经过庄员们充分讨论，大家都了解了勤俭办社的好处，想出了许多好主意。比如多积农家肥料代替化学肥料，水稻全部实行旱直播（播种后再向稻田里放水），分期定量合理灌溉，评工分要奖励技术，节省劳动力开荒、搞副业，生产开支和社员预支不能超过规定的“防线”等等。原来农庄准备买两部汽车，经过庄员们一场争论，改为买二十七匹马和十二辆胶轮大车。这样不光节省下了一万多元开支，而且更适合于农庄需要。
    农庄领导同志还领我参观了农庄的各种设备，像脱谷机、制米机、农具修理所、广播室、俱乐部、托儿所、食堂以及各种半机械化农业机械等等，应有尽有。六部制米机一昼夜能出米七万斤，制米场房门外那两部挺着脖子的脱谷机是农庄的技术员们自己安装起来的。打谷场西边是宽敞的猪舍和畜棚，共有牛马一百五十二头，猪一百二十只。全农庄的公共财产约值二十五万多元。只要知道七八年前这里还只是一片水洼子，就会想像得出庄员们在这里付出了多么惊人的劳动！
    至于庄员们现在的生活水平，那是一眼就看得出来的。就照农庄主席金白山这个家庭来说吧，他有一个能干的妻子和两个小孩，前几年全家的净收入每年都在一千五百元以上，最高曾达到二千元。他们住着一座三年前农庄统一给庄员设计和修建的朝鲜式房屋，一进门，炕头上一个书橱，一面大挂镜，两旁并排着两个很别致的米黄色衣柜和被柜，拉开玻璃窗对面的一扇活动隔墙，露出一个很干净的小厨房，里边有抽水机井，玻璃碗橱，水泥砌的锅台上整齐的嵌着大小三口圆斗式的朝鲜锅，我是和黑龙江省于杰副省长一行七个人在这铺大炕上住宿的，我担心大家都没带行李会给农庄添麻烦，可是晚上金白山把被柜门一开，花花绿绿的被子一个劲儿往外拉，光他家的行李我们这伙人铺的盖的全都有了。
    金白山的家庭生活在农庄来说是中上等的。我还访问过另外几个家庭，情况都不相上下，就说金白山隔壁那个生活比较差一些的女庄员李贞淑，也还有能力供着一双儿女上中学，每顿饭吃的是上等大米，两三样菜。她是农庄妇女当中劳动最出色的一个。我访问老庄员杜在岩那天晚上，他正在炕头上和孩子们听收音机里的朝鲜歌曲，他说这收音机是因为自己看不成报纸才买的，他顶喜欢听的是国际上的事儿。这个在旧社会当了三十年长工的老庄员曾经创造了一种“双手割稻法”，使割稻效率比别人提高一倍，他真心诚意地把技术传授给别人，有的庄员经过学习技术超过了他，他反倒高兴得晚上睡不着觉。他谦逊地向我说：“我没什么好经验贡献给关心我们的农民兄弟，我只觉得没有农庄就没有我！”
    我不能把庄员们要我传达给读者的话都写出来，不过有个老庄员江东勋我还是要写一下：长眉毛，红面孔、一撮黄灿灿的小胡子，说起话来很有风趣。他现在供着三个大孩子上学，有一个还是大学生哩，别人说他经历多，要他给来信的农民兄弟介绍点“宝贵经验”，他想了想，轻声笑道：“经验嘛，莫做对不起农庄的事。”他搔搔头皮，又跟上一句“做了自己要后悔的”。我不明白他的意思，要求他具体说一说，他像是有点难为情，光是眯拢着眼睛，重复地说着“最幸福的啦！农庄给的。”直到第二天，庄员们才告诉我关于他的一段有趣的故事：
    农庄刚成立起来他不参加，说是自己老老小小十来口，只两条破被子，穷怕了，不敢冒失。他老婆常开会，思想比他进步，后来到底动员他参加了。可是他总是提心吊胆，怕挣分少，全家饿肚子。有一次驾牛犁田，想犁快些，多挣分，就拼命地打牛，一气把牛给打残了，他觉得反正是农庄的牛，不心痛，便悄悄地到畜牧场另换了一头。他以为这件事谁也不知道就算过去了。不料在一次批判雇佣观点的庄员大会上，叫他老婆活托给揭出来了，他当时只张着嘴，呆呆地站在那里说不出话来。从此对他老婆恼恨在心，他老婆几次向他讲道理，他胡子一噘说：“胳膊肘往外拐，你呀，哼！”到了秋天，农庄稻子丰收了，他料想不到自己分到了两万多斤大米，比单干时收入提高了三四倍，他高兴之下深感于心有愧了。于是他向老婆陪了不是，又自动跑到农庄管理委员会去做检讨。从此一提起农庄的好处，他心里就后悔不该做那件对不起农庄的事。听了这段故事，我才体会到他那两句话的真切含义，这算得是向各地刚入社的农民兄弟介绍的一条“宝贵经验”哩！
    我要离开农庄那天早晨，农庄几条整齐的街道上洒满了金色的阳光，打谷场前边的广场上人声嘈杂，电焊工们在紧张地修理着播种机具。我和李在根登上那座高大的变压器支架旁边的一个稻草堆，眺望着矗立在松花江边的灌溉站、拖拉机站和那田间道路上来来往往的送粪车队。李在根翻开小笔记本，一面统计着当天庄员参加积肥的人数，一面向我说道：“您看，昨晚刚广播了这一小段的生产安排，今天庄员就全部行动起来了。只要没有不可抗拒的意外灾害，我们一定向困难作斗争，秋后向大家报告丰收消息。”
    分手以后，我时刻怀念着他们，也不断听到他们在争取水稻丰产过程中的艰苦努力的事迹。全国人民鼓舞着他们争取丰收；而他们又以丰收消息向全国人民报捷，这真是太好了。却没想到竟突然遭到一场洪水。……
    我拿着他们的来信，回忆着这一切。后来，我继续读下去：
    “……虽然遭了意外的灾害，我们并没有失掉生产救灾的信心，我们想：旧社会都叫我们翻过来了，还能叫这点水灾吓倒了？我们首先检查主观方面的缺点……。想一切办法给明年生产做好准备。我们还派出了三个副业生产队——采伐队、运输队、打鱼队，老社员杜在岩和江东勋都卷着袖口上山采伐去了，李贞淑和全体妇女们担当起农庄的秋收。我们坚决贯彻执行生产自救和勤俭办社的方针，争取每个劳动日分到二元多。……”
    看完信我又笑自己，人家庄员们干劲这样大，我倒泄了气。听说别处有些受灾社的社员缺乏生产自救的信心，有的光想依赖政府救济，那么星火集体农庄庄员们这种乐观情绪和克服困难的精神，也许对他们是一个鼓舞吧。
