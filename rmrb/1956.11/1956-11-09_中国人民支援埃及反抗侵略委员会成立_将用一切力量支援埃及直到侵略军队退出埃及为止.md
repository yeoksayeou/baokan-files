Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Leading figures from China's democratic parties and people's organizations held a joint meeting tonight. The meeting decided to establish the Chinese People's Committee to Support Egypt Against Aggression, and adopted the "Declaration of the Chinese People's Committee to Support Egypt Against Aggression."

The joint meeting was convened by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace.

Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, presided over today's meeting. He said that today's meeting mainly discussed the proposal from the joint meeting of democratic parties and people's organizations on November 2nd, to establish the Chinese People's Committee to Support Egypt Against Aggression, to unify the leadership of the entire Chinese people's actions in support of Egypt against Anglo-French aggression.

Subsequently, the leaders of various democratic parties and people's organizations spoke at the meeting, including: Bao Erhan, Wang Shaoyao, Chen Qiyou, Liao Chengzhi, Huang Qixiang, Li Zhuchen, Zhuang Mingli, Wang Zhixiang, Wang Zizhong, Xie Xuehong, Li Dequan, Cao Mengjun, Luo Longji, Chen Hansheng, Zhang Xiruo, Zhu Xuefan, Mo Yichang, Wu Maosun, and others. They unanimously agreed to establish the Chinese People's Committee to Support Egypt Against Aggression, and believed that the establishment of this committee was timely and reflected the will of the 600 million Chinese people.

The leaders of various democratic parties and people's organizations emphasized in their speeches that although the Anglo-French aggressors had to agree to a ceasefire, the war of aggression had not stopped in Egypt. The British, French, and Israeli aggressor troops still occupy Egyptian territory and continue to carry out military conspiracies. The Chinese people must take all effective measures to strive to support the Egyptian people until the aggressor troops withdraw from Egyptian territory.

Many people could not restrain their feelings of anger in their speeches. Li Dequan said that the Chinese Red Cross not only morally supports the Egyptian people along with the people of the whole country, but also has made some material preparations such as medicine. She firmly stated that if she was sent to Egypt, she would immediately take a medical team to Egypt. Cao Mengjun said in her speech that Chinese women absolutely cannot tolerate the continued suffering of Egyptian women and children. We must use practical actions to support Egypt. She said that she would do whatever was needed of her to support Egypt.

The meeting finally decided that the Chinese People's Committee to Support Egypt Against Aggression will convene a plenary meeting of the committee in the coming days.
