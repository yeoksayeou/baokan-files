    Under the leadership of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great organizer and leader of the most respected Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution in the early 20th century, the revolution of 1911 (i.e., the Xinhai Revolution) broke out, overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, which had ruled for nearly three hundred years, bringing the end of the Chinese imperial autocratic regime, and bringing hope to the oppressed peoples of all ethnic groups in China.
    The great Mr. Sun Yat-sen cooperated with the Chinese Communist Party in the cause of national liberation of the Chinese people and established a national united front against imperialism, feudalism, and colonialism. He established friendly relations with the great Soviet Union with great hope. In a letter to the Soviet Union shortly before his death, he said: "I would like to express my warm hope that dawn will soon break, when the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally, and the two countries will join hands and advance together in the great battle for the freedom of the oppressed peoples of the world to achieve victory." The great Mr. Sun Yat-sen's prediction is being realized today.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen's principles and content regarding national issues also changed with the development of the Chinese revolution and the influence of the experience of the October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's new revolutionary national program was stipulated in the declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang as follows: "First, the Chinese nation seeks its own liberation. Second, all ethnic groups within China are equal." The same declaration also stated: "After the victory of the revolution against imperialism and warlords, a free and unified Republic of China (a free union of all ethnic groups) should be organized." Each ethnic group exercises its right to be the master of its own affairs. It can be clearly seen from this that the sharp spearhead of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's nationalism is mainly aimed at imperialism, feudalism, and all colonialists, and it is a nationalism that demands Chinese national independence.
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his report on The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China at the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China on September 15, 1954: "At this time, the great revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, from the experience of many years of struggle, realized that in order to achieve the goal of saving the country, 'we must awaken the masses and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together.' He finally bravely adopted the three major policies of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to agriculture and industry, reorganized the Kuomintang, established an alliance with the Chinese Communist Party against imperialism and feudalism, and launched a new revolutionary struggle."
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen firmly opposed infringing upon the interests of other nations and wars of aggression. He loved peace and demanded that all weak nations become people living free and equal lives. He also opposed the imperialists' transformation of their policies of aggression into a tool to deceive the world—cosmopolitanism. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said: "As for the cosmopolitanism that Europeans are talking about now, it is actually a doctrine of power without justice..."
    The great revolutionary, patriot, and democrat—Mr. Sun Yat-sen—was a great thinker who loved China and demanded that China become a free, liberated, and happy country.
    The wishes of the great Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong struggle have only been realized in the People's Republic of China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The people's revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party has traversed a difficult and glorious road for more than 30 years, finally bringing to an end the slave regime of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism that had long oppressed the people of all ethnic groups in China, and establishing a great family of friendly cooperation among the people of all ethnic groups—the democratic, happy, free, and liberated People's Republic of China. Chairman Mao Zedong said in his opening address at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on September 21, 1949: "Our predecessors never ceased their unyielding struggle against internal and external oppressors, including the Revolution of 1911 led by the great pioneer of the Chinese revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Our predecessors instructed us to fulfill their legacy. We are doing this now. We have united and overthrown internal and external oppressors through the People's Liberation War and the People's Great Revolution, and proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China."
    As we commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of the great revolutionary Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we express our highest respect to him. His great patriotism and his spirit of infinite loyalty to the people will forever be remembered in the hearts of the people of all ethnic groups in our great motherland. Every Chinese should learn from his great patriotic spirit.

    学习孙中山先生热爱祖国的精神
    包尔汉
    二十世纪初在最值得尊敬的中国资产阶级民主革命的伟大的组织者和领导者孙中山先生的领导下，1911年爆发了革命（即辛亥革命），推翻了已经统治将近三百年的清朝帝制，使中国的皇朝专制政权宣告结束，给中国被压迫的各族人民带来了希望。
    伟大的孙中山先生在中国人民的民族解放事业中曾经与中国共产党合作建立了反对帝国主义、封建主义和殖民主义的民族统一战线。他曾以巨大的希望同伟大的苏联建立了友谊关系。他在逝世不久以前向苏联写的一封信中这样说：“我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。”伟大的孙中山先生的这个预见，今天正在实现着。
    孙中山先生关于民族问题的原则和内容，也是随着中国革命的发展和苏联十月社会主义革命经验的影响而变化的。孙中山先生的新的革命的民族纲领在国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言中作了如下规定：“一则中国民族自求解放。二则中国境内各民族一律平等。”在同一宣言中又说：“于反对帝国主义及军阀之革命。获得胜利以后。当组织自由统一的（各民族自由联合的）中华民国。”由各民族行使自己当家做主的权利。从这里显然可以看出：孙中山先生的民族主义的锋利的矛头，主要是对准着帝国主义、封建主义和所有的殖民主义者，它是要求中国民族独立的民族主义。
    刘少奇同志1954年9月15日在中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告中，曾经这样说：“在这个时候，伟大的革命家孙中山，从多年奋斗的经验中，认识了要达到救国的目的‘必须唤起民众，及联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗’。他终于勇敢地采取了联苏、联共、扶助农工的三大政策，改组了国民党，同中国共产党建立了反帝反封建的联盟，展开了新的革命斗争。”
    孙中山先生是坚决反对侵犯别的民族利益和侵略战争的，他热爱和平，不论任何弱小民族，他都要求他们都成为过着自由平等生活的人。他也反对帝国主义者把他们的侵略政策，变相的换为欺骗世人的工具——世界主义。孙中山先生曾经说：“至于欧洲人现在所讲的世界主义，其实就是有强权无公理的主义……”
    伟大的革命家，爱国主义者和民主派——孙中山先生他是热爱中国，要求中国成为自由、解放和幸福的国家的伟大的思想家。
    伟大的孙中山先生一生斗争的愿望，只有在中国共产党领导下的中华人民共和国才实现了。在中国共产党领导下的人民革命，三十几年来踏过了艰难困苦和光荣的道路，终于使帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义长期压迫中国各族人民的奴隶政权宣告结束，并建立了各民族人民友好合作的大家庭——民主幸福自由解放的中华人民共和国。毛泽东主席1949年9月21日在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议的开幕词中曾这样说过：“我们的先人以不屈不挠的斗争反对内外压迫者，从来没有停止过，其中包括伟大的中国革命先行者孙中山先生所领导的辛亥革命在内。我们的先人指示我们，叫我们完成他们的遗志。我们现在是这样做了。我们团结起来，以人民解放战争和人民大革命打倒了内外压迫者，宣布中华人民共和国的成立了。”
    我们在纪念伟大的革命家孙中山先生诞生九十周年的时候，向他表示崇高的敬意。他的那种伟大的爱国主义和对人民无限忠诚的精神，将永远铭记在我们伟大祖国各族人民的心中。我们每个中国人都应该学习他的这种伟大的爱国主义精神。
