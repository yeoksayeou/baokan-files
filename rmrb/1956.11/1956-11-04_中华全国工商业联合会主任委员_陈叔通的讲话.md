Comrades, Mr. Egyptian Ambassador:

The governments of the United Kingdom and France, in order to restore their robber-like colonial policy in the Near East as a whole, used the Suez Canal issue as a pretext to instigate Israeli troops to attack Egypt. Under the pretext of protecting the Suez Canal, they brazenly launched a large-scale attack on Egypt, disregarding the condemnation of world public opinion. This is a bloody war of aggression that has aroused great indignation from the people of China and the people of the world.

The armed aggression against Egypt by the governments of the United Kingdom and France has brutally trampled on Egypt's sovereignty and is also a challenge to the people of Arab countries. It has seriously violated the UN Charter, undermined Asian-African peace, and threatened world peace and security.

We, the national industrialists and businessmen, like the people of the whole country, will never tolerate the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt. We firmly condemn and protest against the Anglo-French governments' war of aggression against Egypt, and firmly demand that the United Kingdom and France immediately withdraw all armed forces. We demand that the United Nations take swift and effective measures to stop Anglo-French aggression and safeguard the dignity of the UN Charter. In order to oppose colonial policies and safeguard world peace, we fully support the heroic struggle of the Egyptian people to safeguard national sovereignty and defend national independence. We believe that the Anglo-French war of aggression is bound to fail, and the Egyptian people's struggle of resistance will surely achieve a great and final victory.

    陈叔通的讲话
    同志们，埃及大使先生：
    英法两国政府为了恢复强盗似的在近东整个的殖民政策，借口苏伊士运河问题，唆使以色列军队进攻埃及，又以保护苏伊士运河为借口，不顾世界一切舆论的谴责，悍然发动了对埃及的大规模的进攻，这是一个血腥的侵略战争，激起了全中国人民和全世界人民的极大愤慨。
    英法两国政府对埃及的武装侵略，横暴地践踏了埃及的主权，同时也是对阿拉伯国家人民的挑战，因而严重地破坏了联合国宪章，破坏了亚非和平，威胁着世界和平和安全。
    我们全国工商业者同全国人民一样，决不能容忍英法对埃及的侵略行为。我们坚决谴责和抗议英法两国政府对埃及的侵略战争，坚决要求英法立即撤退一切武装部队。我们要求联合国迅速采取切实有效的措施制止英法的侵略行为，来保障联合国宪章的尊严。我们为了反对殖民政策，为了维护世界和平，我们全力支持埃及人民为维护国家主权和保卫民族独立而进行的英勇斗争，我们相信英法的侵略战争一定要失败，埃及人民的反抗斗争，一定能够取得伟大的最后的胜利。
