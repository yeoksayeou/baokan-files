    Immediately Stop the Armed Aggression of Egypt by Britain and France
    After instigating Israel to attack Egypt, the British and French governments, using the pretext of protecting the Suez Canal and disregarding the warnings of world opinion, brazenly launched a large-scale armed invasion of Egypt, filling the calm skies of Egypt and the Middle East with the flames of war and subjecting the peace-loving and working Egyptian people to the suffering of war. Since October 31, the British and French air forces have been bombing many peaceful cities in Egypt. The two countries have also established a joint British-French command to direct the armed invasion of Egypt. British and French troops gathered in the Mediterranean are advancing towards the Suez Canal area. The Egyptian people have mobilized to resist the invaders.
    The barbaric act of aggression by the British and French governments violates the universally recognized principles of international law and seriously threatens world peace. Our government issued a statement on November 1, strongly condemning the British and French acts of aggression and firmly supporting the Egyptian people's struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and national independence. The statement demanded that Britain and France immediately stop the aggression, cease their armed provocations against Arab countries, and negotiate peacefully on the Suez Canal issue without further delay. China's 600 million people fully support our government's solemn position and are extremely indignant at the open armed aggression against Egypt by Britain and France!
    The British and French armed aggression against Egypt has been premeditated for a long time. Ever since Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company, Britain and France have concentrated a large number of troops in the Mediterranean and have repeatedly threatened to implement a "tough policy," attempting to coerce Egypt into abandoning its sacred sovereignty over the Suez Canal. For more than three months, the British and French governments have refused to provide assurances that they would not use force to resolve the Suez Canal issue. After the United Nations Security Council made a resolution on the six principles for resolving the Suez Canal issue, Britain and France repeatedly delayed holding negotiations with the Egyptian government, while secretly and actively instigating Israel to launch an armed attack on Egypt in order to create a pretext for armed aggression against Egypt. Before Israel invaded Egypt, the British fleet in the Mediterranean, under the cover of exercises to so-called "test loading equipment," mobilized armed forces to invade Egypt. After Israel invaded Egypt, Britain refused to condemn Israel's aggression while immediately issuing an ultimatum to Egypt demanding that Egypt abandon the Suez Canal area. These are all evidence of Britain and France's deliberate aggression against Egypt. British Prime Minister Eden, after launching the war of aggression against Egypt, sophistically argued that Britain was not "restraining Egypt, but restraining war." At a time when British bombs have already fallen on peaceful cities in Egypt, and when the heinous faces of British and French imperialists, with their inherent aggression, have been completely exposed, Eden's words are simply the height of shamelessness.
    For more than three months, the British and French governments have repeatedly stated that they want Egypt to guarantee the freedom and safety of navigation in the Suez Canal, but now the facts have once again proved that it is not other countries that are undermining the freedom and safety of canal navigation, but Britain and France themselves. The British and French armed aggression against Egypt shows that what they want to seize from the Egyptian people is not just the Suez Canal, but Egypt's entire national sovereignty, the precious national independence that the Egyptian people have achieved through numerous bloody struggles. The shameful acts of aggression by Britain and France are a challenge to the solemn Bandung spirit, a challenge to the more than one billion peace-loving, independence-loving, and freedom-loving people of Asia and Africa, and a challenge to peace-loving people all over the world.
    There is no doubt that the people of Asia and Africa and peace-loving people all over the world will answer this vicious challenge of the imperialists, resolutely support the Egyptian brothers who are fighting a bloody resistance, and not allow the colonialists to run rampant and set fires and loot. The statements issued by the governments of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and India regarding the British and French aggression against Egypt reflect the righteous indignation and demands of the broad masses of people in the world. Under the pressure of the American people, the United States government, while stating that it will not be involved in the British and French acts of aggression, is nevertheless responsible for the fact that today's barbaric acts of aggression by Britain and France are precisely the result of the consistent support they have received from the United States since the Suez Canal issue arose. And now the US government has neither condemned the British and French aggression nor is it prepared to use its influence to stop the British and French aggression. This cannot but make people express extreme suspicion about the role the United States is playing in this war of aggression.
    The British and French armed aggression against Egypt seriously undermines the United Nations Charter and threatens world peace. The Security Council and the United Nations should immediately take strong measures to stop the criminal act of armed aggression against Egypt by Britain and France and ensure that the Suez Canal issue is resolved through peaceful consultation. The broad masses of people in Britain and France should immediately take action to resolutely stop the colonialists' adventurous acts of dragging them into the quagmire of a war of aggression. Our people will stand with the peace-loving people all over the world, firmly support the Egyptian people, and fight to stop the armed aggression by Britain and France.

### 立即制止英、法对埃及的武装侵略

    立即制止英、法对埃及的武装侵略
    英、法两国政府在指使以色列进攻埃及以后，以所谓保护苏伊士运河为借口，不顾世界舆论的警告，悍然发动了对埃及的大规模武装进攻，从而使静朗的埃及和中东的天空，充满了战争的火焰，使珍爱和平和劳动的埃及人民，蒙受着战争的苦难。从10月31日起，英、法空军对埃及许多和平城市进行了轰炸。两国并成立了英、法联军总部，指挥对埃及的武装侵略。集结在地中海地区的英、法军队正在向苏伊士运河区进发。埃及人民已经动员起来准备抵抗侵略者。
    英法两国政府野蛮的侵略行为，违犯了世界公认的国际法原则，严重地威胁了世界和平。我国政府已经在11月1日为此发表声明，强烈谴责英、法的侵略行为，坚决支持埃及人民维护国家主权和民族独立的斗争。声明要求英、法立即停止侵略，制止对阿拉伯国家的武装挑衅，并且不再迟延地就苏伊士运河问题进行和平协商。我国六亿人民完全支持我国政府的严正立场，并且对于英、法两国对埃及公然进行武装侵略感到极大的愤慨！
    英、法对埃及的武装侵略是蓄谋已久了的。自从埃及将苏伊士运河公司收归国有以来，英、法在地中海集中了大量兵力，并且一再扬言要执行“强硬政策”，企图胁迫埃及放弃对苏伊士运河的神圣主权。近三个多月中，英法政府一直拒绝提出不使用武力解决苏伊士运河问题的保证。在联合国安全理事会作出解决苏伊士运河问题六项原则的决议以后，英、法又一再拖延同埃及政府举行谈判，同时却暗地里积极唆使以色列武装进攻埃及，以制造武装侵略埃及的借口。在以色列侵入埃及之前，地中海上的英国舰队就以进行所谓“试验装载设备”的演习为掩护，调动侵略埃及的武装力量。而在以色列侵入埃及以后，英国一面拒绝谴责以色列的侵略行为，一面就立即向埃及提出了要求埃及放弃苏伊士运河区的最后通牒。这都是英法蓄意侵略埃及的罪证。英国首相艾登在发动侵略埃及的战争以后还狡辩说：英国并不是“制止埃及，而是制止战争”。在英国的炸弹已经落在埃及的和平城市的时候，在英、法帝国主义者侵略成性的狰狞面目已经彻底暴露的时候，艾登的这种话实在是无耻已极。
    三个多月来，英、法政府口口声声要埃及保证苏伊士运河的通航自由和安全，但是，现在事实又一次证明，破坏运河航行自由和安全的不是别国，却正是英、法自己。英、法对埃及的武装侵略行动，说明它们所要向埃及人民夺取的，决不止苏伊士运河，而是埃及的整个国家主权，是埃及人民经过了多次流血斗争才取得的珍贵的民族独立。英、法的可耻的侵略行动，是对庄严的万隆精神的挑战，是对十多亿热爱和平、热爱独立和自由的亚非人民的挑战。也是对全世界爱好和平的人民的挑战。
    毫无疑问，亚非人民和全世界爱好和平的人民将要回答帝国主义者的这种凶恶的挑战，坚决支持流血抗战的埃及弟兄，不许殖民主义者横行无忌地放火抢劫。苏联、南斯拉夫和印度等政府就英、法对埃及的侵略所发表的声明，反映了世界广大人民的义愤和要求。美国政府在美国人民的压力之下，虽然表示它将不牵连到英、法的侵略行动中去，但是英、法今天的野蛮侵略行为，正是它们从苏伊士运河问题发生以来一贯受到美国支持的结果。而现在美国政府并没有谴责英、法的侵略，也不准备运用它的影响制止英、法的侵略。这就不能不使人对美国在这场侵略战争中所起的作用表示极大的怀疑。
    英、法对埃及的武装侵略，严重地破坏了联合国宪章，威胁着世界和平。安全理事会和联合国应当立即采取强硬措施，制止英、法的武装侵略埃及的犯罪行为，保证采取和平协商的方式解决苏伊士运河问题。英、法两国的广大人民群众，应当立即行动起来，坚决制止殖民主义者把它们拖向侵略战争火坑的冒险行径。我国人民将同全世界爱好和平的人民在一起，坚决支持埃及人民，为制止英、法的武装侵略而斗争。
