Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Dingfang reports: Bricklayers at three construction sites in the western suburbs of Beijing are using bricks to build a type of arched floor to replace reinforced concrete floors. This type of floor saves 50% of steel and cement compared to reinforced concrete floors, is one-third cheaper to build, and has better sound insulation.

The brick arch floor was successfully tested by the Beijing Design Institute. The person in charge of the design institute told reporters that more than half of the steel and cement used to build a building is used on the floors. If this new type of floor is promoted, it can save a large amount of steel and cement.

The designers conducted an appraisal test on the weight that this type of floor can bear. When they hung iron blocks on the floor, and the weight exceeded the design standard by one time, the floor did not crack at all. Some people worried that this type of floor would crack with slight vibrations. The designers did another interesting experiment. They first dropped a 20-kilogram iron block from a height of 50 centimeters onto a hollow precast floor, and the floor cracked. Then, using the same iron block, they dropped it from a height of 150 centimeters onto the brick arch floor, and the floor vibrated slightly, without any cracks or breaks on the surface.

This type of floor, when hung on the ceiling, is as beautiful as a reinforced concrete floor. It is also very convenient to install heating and sanitary equipment on the floor. Recently, the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Ministry of Urban Construction decided to promote this new type of floor in residential and office building construction nationwide.

    北京设计院试验砖拱楼板成功
    新华社16日讯　新华社记者周定舫报道：北京西郊三个工地的瓦工正在用砖砌成一种拱形楼板来代替钢筋混凝土楼板。这种楼板比钢筋混凝土楼板能节省50％的钢筋和水泥，造价便宜三分之一，而且隔音效果好。
    砖拱楼板是北京市设计院试验成功的。设计院负责人告诉记者说，兴建一幢楼房所用的钢筋、水泥，其中有半数以上用在楼板上。如果推广这种新型楼板，能够节省大量钢筋和水泥。
    设计人员对这种楼板所能承担的重量，做了鉴定试验。当他们把铁块悬挂在楼板上，重量超过设计标准一倍的时候，楼板丝毫没有发生破裂现象。有人担心这种楼板稍受震动，就会裂开。设计人员又做了有趣的试验。他们先用二十公斤重的铁块从五十公分高处落在空心预制楼板上，结果楼板破裂。接着，再用这块铁块，从一百五十公分高处落在砖拱楼板上，楼板稍微震动了一下，表面没有丝毫损裂。
    这种楼板吊上顶棚，同钢筋混凝土楼板一样美观。在楼板上安装暖气和卫生设备也很方便。最近，建筑工程部和城市建设部决定，准备在全国的住宅和办公楼建筑中推广这种新型楼板。
