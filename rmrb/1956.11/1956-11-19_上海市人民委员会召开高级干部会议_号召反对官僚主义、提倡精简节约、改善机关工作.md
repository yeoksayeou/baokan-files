Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 18th: The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee convened a meeting of cadres at the bureau level and above on the 16th. Cao Diqiu, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, delivered a mobilization report at the meeting on opposing bureaucracy, promoting streamlining and economy, and improving the work of the organs.

Cao Diqiu reminded everyone with concrete examples that bureaucratic tendencies in Shanghai's organs at all levels are very serious, with large organizations, many levels, and overstaffing. Many leading cadres are busy with a large number of official documents, forms, and lengthy meetings, and do not understand the situation at the lower levels, thus being divorced from the masses. The tendency of departmentalism and indifference to politics in organs at all levels is also very serious, and the phenomenon of extravagance and waste is growing.

In response to these situations, Cao Diqiu put forward suggestions for improving the work of organs at all levels. He said that to overcome bureaucracy, it is necessary to rectify organizations and rectify the thinking and work style of cadres. Organs at all levels should tighten their staffing and establish and improve systems. The phenomenon of unclear division of responsibilities among subordinate organs must be changed, and at the same time, unified and collective leadership must be strengthened. A thorough inspection should be carried out on the extravagance and waste in housing equipment and car usage in various organs.

    上海市人民委员会召开高级干部会议
    号召反对官僚主义、提倡精简节约、改善机关工作
    新华社上海18日电　上海市人民委员会16日召集局长以上干部举行会议。上海市副市长曹荻秋在会上作了反对官僚主义、提倡精简节约、改善机关工作的动员报告。
    曹荻秋以具体的事例提醒大家，上海各级机关中的官僚主义倾向很严重，机构庞大，层次多，人浮于事。许多领导干部忙在大量的公文、表报和冗长的会议中，不了解下情，脱离群众。各级机关的本位主义和不问政治的倾向也很严重，铺张浪费的现象正在滋长。
    曹荻秋针对这些情况，提出了改进各级机关工作的意见。他说，要克服官僚主义，必须整顿组织，整顿干部思想和作风。各级机关都应该紧缩编制，建立和健全制度。所属机关职责范围不清的现象必须改变，同时要加强统一与集体领导。对各机关的房屋设备、汽车使用中存在的铺张浪费现象，要进行一次检查。
