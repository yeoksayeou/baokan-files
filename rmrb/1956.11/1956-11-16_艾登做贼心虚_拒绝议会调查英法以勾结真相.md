Xinhua News Agency, November 15th dispatch from London: British Prime Minister Eden refused on November 13th to establish an all-party parliamentary committee to investigate whether the British and French governments colluded with Israel before the attack on Egypt.

The suggestion to investigate the government's actions was put forward in the House of Commons by Labor MP Wigg, at which time Eden flatly replied, "The answer is no."

Before refusing the parliamentary investigation into the truth, the British government had repeatedly denied that Britain and France knew of Israel's plan to attack Egypt in advance.

    艾登做贼心虚
    拒绝议会调查英法以勾结真相
    新华社15日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相艾登11月13日拒绝成立一个包括各党派的议会调查委员会来查明英法两国政府是否在进攻埃及以前就同以色列勾结在一起。
    关于调查政府行动的建议是工党议员威格在下院里提出的，当时艾登断然回答说：“答复是不。”
    在拒绝议会调查真相以前，英国政府曾经一再否认英法事先就知道以色列进攻埃及的计划。
