Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th - The "Pravda" published today an editorial entitled "The Hungarian Working People Will Defend Their Socialist Achievements," saying that the documents published in today's "Pravda," such as the "Letter to the Hungarian People" of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, are documents of great political significance. These documents profoundly explain the events that have taken place in Hungary in recent days, and also clarify the program of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government headed by Kadar.

The editorial then introduced the "Letter to the Hungarian People" of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government. The editorial said that the working people of Hungary did not allow domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries to trample on the great socialist achievements. At the critical moment when People's Hungary was facing life and death, all true patriots of Hungary united and firmly opposed those who attempted to take advantage of the legitimate and justified demands of the working people to correct serious errors in past leadership, and to lead the country away from the socialist path. Every worker, peasant, and intellectual in Hungary has personally witnessed the desperate struggle of the counter-revolutionaries during these difficult days, vainly attempting to seize power, return factories to capitalists, return land to landlords, and allow gendarmes and old officers to ride on the heads of the people again. Many honest workers who had been deceived by reactionaries have now opened their eyes and seen the true face of the enemies of the people. The Hungarian people have not allowed the overthrow of the people's democratic system, have not allowed the wheel of history to turn backwards, and have not allowed the old capitalist and landlord system that hated the working people to be restored in the country.

The editorial emphasized that the latest news from Hungary proves that the program of the new government has received the full support of the patriots of People's Hungary. In factories and even on the streets, people are enthusiastically discussing and supporting this program, and expressing their determination to actively implement it. The Hungarian working people are not isolated in their struggle against the enemies of socialism. All socialist countries and all those who cherish the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism express their warm brotherly solidarity with them. There is no doubt that the Hungarian working people, headed by the working class, relying on the fraternal support of the socialist countries, will unite to realize the program of their worker-peasant revolutionary government and to realize the great task of socialist construction.

    苏联“真理报”社论指出
    匈工农革命政府纲领受到人民支持
    新华社莫斯科5日电　“真理报”今日发表题为“匈牙利劳动人民将保卫自己的社会主义成果”的社论说，“真理报”今天刊载的匈牙利工农革命政府“告匈牙利人民书”等文件，是一些具有重要政治意义的文件。这些文件深刻地说明了最近几天在匈牙利发生的事件，还阐明了以卡达尔为首的匈牙利工农革命政府的纲领。
    社论接着介绍了匈牙利工农革命政府的“致匈牙利人民书”。社论说，匈牙利的劳动人民没有让国内外的反革命蹂躏掉伟大的社会主义成果。在人民匈牙利面临生死危险的关头，匈牙利一切真正的爱国者团结一致，坚定不移地反对那些企图利用劳动人民合理地和正当地要求纠正过去领导上的严重错误的机会而使国家离开社会主义道路的人。匈牙利每个工人、农民、脑力劳动者在这艰苦的日子里亲眼看到了反革命的拼命的挣扎，妄想夺取政权，把工厂归还资本家，把土地归还地主，让宪兵和旧军官重新骑在人民的头上。许多曾被反动分子蒙骗了的正直的劳动者现在已睁开了眼睛，看清了人民的敌人的真面貌。匈牙利人民没有容许推翻人民民主制度，没有让历史的车轮倒转，没有让仇恨劳动人民的旧资本家地主制度在国内复辟。
    社论强调说，来自匈牙利的最新的消息证明，新政府的纲领得到人民匈牙利爱国者的完全支持。在各工厂里、甚至在街道上人们都在热烈地讨论和拥护这个纲领，并且表示要积极实现这一纲领的决心。匈牙利劳动人民在反对社会主义敌人的斗争中不是孤立的。各个社会主义国家、所有珍惜和平、民主、社会主义事业的人都对他们表示热烈的兄弟的声援。毫无疑问，以工人阶级为首的匈牙利劳动人民，依靠各社会主义国家的兄弟声援，将团结一致地去实现自己的工农革命政府的纲领，去实现社会主义建设的伟大任务。
