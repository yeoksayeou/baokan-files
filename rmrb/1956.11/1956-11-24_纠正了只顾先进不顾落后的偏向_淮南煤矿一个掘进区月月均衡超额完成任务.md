Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 23rd: The Party branch of the Excavation Zone Two of the Jiulonggang Mine in Huainan Coal Mine helped backward workers improve their ideological and technical levels in all aspects, reversing the passive situation in production that had persisted in this zone for a long time. Since May this year, each team in this zone has overfulfilled its production tasks monthly and evenly. Excavation Team Three, which had failed to complete its production tasks for eight consecutive months, has now been named an advanced production team of the Jiulonggang Coal Mine.

The Party branch of Excavation Zone Two used to only focus on cultivating advanced teams, neglecting specific assistance to backward teams. For example, among the twenty-five workers in the advanced "Resist America" Team Nine, twenty-three were Party members, Youth League members, and activists. Sometimes, when other teams were assigned better work surfaces, they would be transferred to the "Resist America" Team Nine for excavation. As a result, while "Resist America" Team Nine overfulfilled its tasks monthly, the production tasks of the other three teams were frequently unfulfilled. Due to the inability to complete production tasks, workers' incomes decreased, their production enthusiasm further declined, and some teams were even unable to hold production meetings.

After discovering the above situation, the Party branch of Excavation Zone Two first examined and criticized its past one-sided practices. At the same time, it repeatedly conducted education among all employees to make them realize that only when the entire zone is advanced can the entire zone's production tasks be guaranteed. Next, the Party organization, together with the administrative leaders, jointly studied and made appropriate adjustments to the technical forces, transferring thirteen skilled workers from the "Resist America" Team Nine to support the most backward Excavation Team Three, and transferred three workers with relatively poor technical skills from Excavation Team Two to the "Resist America" Team Nine for training.

The Party branch also tried to help workers improve their operational skills in all aspects. For example, after discovering that worker Wang Jingting of "Resist America" Team Nine, due to his mastery of deep-hole blasting techniques, had a greater excavation footage than other workers, they immediately organized forces to summarize his experience and widely promoted it throughout the zone. As a result, the excavation workers throughout the zone basically learned Wang Jingting's drilling method, and excavation efficiency was greatly improved compared to the past.

The Party branch also provided specific care for some workers with special difficulties. For example, worker Fang Zhong of the takeover team had stomach problems, and going to the early and night shifts delayed his medical treatment and often asked for leave. The Party branch suggested to the administration that he be fixed on the middle shift. The workers who received care further leaned towards the organization, and their production enthusiasm was very high.

### 纠正了只顾先进不顾落后的偏向  淮南煤矿一个掘进区月月均衡超额完成任务

    纠正了只顾先进不顾落后的偏向
    淮南煤矿一个掘进区月月均衡超额完成任务
    新华社合肥23日电　中共淮南煤矿九龙岗矿掘进二区的支部，从各方面帮助落后工人提高思想水平和技术水平，扭转了这个区长期以来生产上的被动局面。从今年5月份起，这个区各队每月都均衡地超额完成生产任务。原来连续八个月没有完成生产任务的掘进三队，现在被命名为九龙岗煤矿的先进生产队。
    掘进二区党支部过去只顾培养先进队，放松对落后队的具体帮助。如这个区先进的抗美九队的二十五个工人中，就配备了党员、团员和积极分子二十三人；有时其他队分配到了比较好的工作面，也要调换给抗美九队去掘进。这样，抗美九队虽然月月超额完成任务，其他三个队的生产任务却经常完不成。由于生产任务不能完成，工人收入减少，他们的生产情绪更加低落，有些队连生产会议也开不起来。
    掘进二区的党支部在发现上述情况以后，首先检查和批判了过去的片面做法，同时在全体职工中反复进行教育，使他们认识到只有全区都先进了，才能保证全区完成生产任务。接着，党组织又同行政领导方面共同研究，将技术力量进行适当调配，从抗美九队调出十三个技术工人支援最落后的掘进三队，又从掘进二队调了三个技术水平较差的工人给抗美九队去培养。
    这个党支部还设法从各方面帮助工人提高操作技术水平。如他们在发现抗美九队工人王敬廷由于熟练地掌握了深孔爆破的操作技术，掘进进尺比其他工人都多的经验以后，立刻组织力量进行了总结，并且在全区里普遍推广。因而，使全区的掘进工人基本上都学会了王敬廷的打眼方法，掘进效率比原来大大提高。
    某些工人有特殊困难，党支部还进行了具体照顾。如接管组工人方忠有胃病，上早班和夜班耽误看病，经常请假，党支部就建议行政上把他固定在中班。得到照顾的工人都进一步靠拢了组织，生产情绪非常高。
