    The Red Days of Humanity
    Soviet Writer Dé·Sàsīlāfúsījī

    Even before the Second World War, millions upon millions of people around the world celebrated the anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, regarding it as a great and glorious holiday. But at that time, this day was mainly the national day of the various peoples of the Soviet Union. Of course, it had great international significance, but it was still limited to a certain place.

    There was a time when bourgeois scholars and commentators asserted that the victory of the socialist revolution in one country was a local phenomenon, a unique phenomenon, and could only be explained by special historical, national, and "racial" conditions. They also said that the victory of the socialist revolution was an extraordinary event that deviated from the norm, merely an "experiment" destined to perish sooner or later; it was as if the Russian people had their own path, and no other people would follow this path.

    Thirty years, twenty years, even fifteen years ago, people said and wrote such things. Many people know that these assertions and predictions are simply foolish. Now, a vast and fascinating scene unfolds before all mankind, with the great Chinese people and the working people of the various People's Democracies of Europe and Asia advancing confidently on the road to socialism alongside the people of the Soviet Union. Generally speaking, now it is no longer one socialist country, but many socialist countries. Now we are one-third of humanity, 900 million inhabitants of our planet. Therefore, the trend of historical development is in favor of the socialist road over the capitalist road.

    In another year, the people of the world will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution. Obviously, all kinds of discussions about "experiments" are meaningless.

    The great revolution has successfully withstood all "trial periods." The Second World War further confirmed the consolidation and power of the Soviet Socialist state.

    Now, the international significance of the Great October Revolution lies not only in the fact that thirty-nine years ago, the workers and peasants of one country, for the first time in world history, under the leadership of the Communist Party, eliminated the rule of landlords and capitalists, and took the new socialist state they had built into their own powerful hands; but also in laying the foundation for a new historical era, the era of the destruction of capitalism and the victory of socialism. The October Revolution has become a festival for all liberated humanity.

    There was a time when the revolution was called the "locomotive of history," a term from the steam age when trains were faster than fast horses, and rail transport was a symbol of speed. The socialist revolution requires a new symbolic image. It can probably be said to be the historical jet plane. Modern social and historical situations change quickly. Each anniversary of the October Revolution is situated amidst new and memorable events.

    We only point out two things. The first is the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and the second is the struggle surrounding the Suez Canal.

    The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China is a vivid manifestation of the achievements of the Chinese people. In the seven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese workers, under the leadership of their glorious Communist Party, have completed the great democratic transformation and are now confidently advancing along the road of building socialism.

    The October Revolution, which marked the arrival and establishment of socialism, also marked the colonial people's liberation from dependence on imperialism. The two are inextricably linked. Marx and Lenin theoretically demonstrated this connection. Colonialism is a product of capitalism and its pillar. A blow to capitalism is also a blow to colonialism. The struggle surrounding the Suez Canal clearly demonstrates this.

    The Arab people have long been engaged in the struggle for their own independence. In different eras, the struggle has taken different forms, but at that time, the struggle always ended in failure.

    The Arab people's continuous struggle for independence was greeted by the October Socialist Revolution. The birth of the socialist state also triggered a powerful national liberation movement throughout the world, especially in Asia. This movement spread to China, India, and subsequently to some Arab countries in Asia and Africa. As a result, the people of many countries have won national independence. A few years ago, the Republic of Egypt declared its establishment. At the end of July this year, an important event occurred in the lives of the Egyptian people - the nationalization of the Suez Canal. This event almost coincided with the forced withdrawal of French troops from Tunisia and Morocco.

    Colonialism has lost its old positions. A powerful international force has already grown up before us. The Arab countries are determined to defend their Egyptian brothers, knowing that seizing the Suez Canal is only the beginning of enslaving the entire Arab world. All progressive humanity stands with Egypt.

    Among the powerful ranks of those who uphold peace, democracy, and the freedom of all nations, the communists are at the forefront. There are hundreds of millions of them, and following them are hundreds of millions of non-Party members. This is the great alliance of the revolutionary proletariat with the peasants, with all workers, with all people. The historically significant victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution for the whole world should be attributed to this alliance. The theory of this alliance was researched by Lenin and confirmed by the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Now, it is also being manifested in the struggle of the oppressed nations for national liberation and the struggle of all mankind for peace and friendship among all peoples.

### 人类的红色的日子

    人类的红色的日子
    苏联作家　德·萨斯拉夫斯基
    还在第二次世界大战以前，地球上就有千千万万的人庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命周年纪念日，把它看作一个伟大而光辉的节日。但是，那时这一天主要是苏联各族人民的国庆日。当然，它有巨大的国际意义，但总还是局限于一定的地方。
    曾有一个时候，资产阶级的学者和政论家们断言说，社会主义革命在一个国家的胜利是地方现象，是绝无仅有的现象，而且只能由特殊的历史、民族和“种族”条件来解释。他们还说，社会主义革命的胜利是超越常轨的非常事件，只是一个早晚注定要灭亡的“试验”而已；俄罗斯人民好像有自己的道路，任何其他人民都不会走上这条道路。
    三十年、二十年，甚至十五年以前都有人这样说过，这样写过。很多人都知道这种断言和预言只是愚蠢。现在，全人类眼前展开了一幅巨大的、引人入胜的情景，伟大的中国人民和欧亚各人民民主国家的劳动人民同苏联人民一道在社会主义的道路上满怀信心地前进着。一般说来，现在已经不是一个社会主义国家了，而是许多社会主义国家了。现在我们是人类的三分之一，是我们星球上的九亿居民了。因此，历史发展的趋势是有利于社会主义道路胜过资本主义道路的。
    再过一年，全世界人民将庆祝十月革命的四十周年了。显然，关于“试验”的各种议论是没有任何意义的。
    伟大的革命成功地经受住了一切“试验时期”。第二次世界大战更证实了苏维埃社会主义国家的巩固和威力。
    现在伟大的十月革命的国际意义，不仅在于三十九年以前，一个国家的工人和农民在世界历史上第一次在共产党的领导下消灭了地主和资本家的政权，并把新的、他们所建设的社会主义国家掌握到自己强有力的手中；而且在于奠定了新的历史时代的基础，奠定了资本主义毁灭和社会主义胜利的时代的基础。十月革命已成为全体被解放了的人类的节日。
    曾经有一个时期，革命被称为“历史的火车头”，这是蒸汽时代的术语，那时火车的速度超过了快马，铁路交通是迅速的象征。社会主义革命则需要一个新的象征形象。这大概可以说是历史的喷气式飞机。现代的社会情况和历史情况变化很快。十月革命的每个周年纪念日都处在一些新的值得纪念的事件中。
    我们只指出两件事。第一件是中国共产党的第八次全国代表大会，第二件就是围绕着苏伊士运河的斗争。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会是中国人民的成就的鲜明表现。从中华人民共和国成立后的七年间，中国劳动者在自己光荣的共产党领导下完成了伟大的民主改造，现在正满怀信心地沿着建设社会主义的道路前进。
    标志着社会主义的到来和确立的十月革命，同时也标志着殖民地人民摆脱对帝国主义的依附。两者是不可分割地联系着的。从理论上论证了这种联系的是马克思和列宁。殖民主义是资本主义的产物并且是它的支柱。对资本主义的打击也就是对殖民主义的打击。围绕着苏伊士运河的斗争非常清楚地表明了这一点。
    阿拉伯人民很早以来就从事争取自己独立的斗争。在不同的时代，斗争曾采取了不同的形式，但是，那时的斗争总是以失败告终。
    阿拉伯人争取独立的不断的斗争迎接了十月社会主义革命。社会主义国家的诞生也在全世界，首先是在亚洲，引起了强大的民族解放运动。这个运动波及到中国、印度，以及继它们之后的亚非一些阿拉伯国家。结果，许多国家的人民争取到民族独立。几年以前，埃及共和国宣布成立。今年7月底，埃及人民的生活中发生了一项重要事件——把苏伊士运河收归了国有。这件事几乎是同法军被迫撤出突尼斯和摩洛哥同时发生的。
    殖民主义失掉了自己的旧阵地。强大的国际力量已经在我们面前成长了起来。阿拉伯国家都决心保卫自己的埃及兄弟，他们知道，侵占苏伊士运河只不过是奴役整个阿拉伯世界的开端。全体进步人类都站在埃及方面。
    在拥护和平、民主和各国人民自由的强大队伍中，共产主义者走在最前列。他们有千百万人，跟着他们的还有几亿非党人士。这是革命的无产阶级同农民，同所有劳动者，同所有的人的伟大联盟。伟大的十月社会主义革命的具有全世界历史意义的胜利，应当归功于这种联盟。这种联盟的理论是由列宁研讨的，由苏联和各人民民主国家的社会主义建设经验所证实的。现在，它也在被压迫民族争取民族解放和全人类争取和平和各族人民友好的斗争中获得了表现。
