Soviet Experts Vigorously Cultivate Talent for Our Country
Many New Specialties Established in Beijing's Universities

According to Xinhua News Agency, many new specialties have been successively established in Beijing's universities. In this work, Soviet experts have put in diligent labor.

In the new academic year, a batch of new specialties has been established in eight higher education institutions including Tsinghua University, Peking University, and Beijing Agricultural University. The Soviet expert Chistiakov helped the Department of Power at Tsinghua University establish the thermal equipment automation specialization, and he plans to cultivate a group of teachers with the level of associate doctor within two years. The Soviet television expert Shaplygin came to Tsinghua University not long ago and opened new courses related to television. He personally compiled lecture notes and, in his lectures, raised unsolved problems in current television equipment and possible solutions, giving teachers a direction to strive for when learning this new science. At Peking University, Soviet expert Sandunova opened more than twenty experiments covering a wide range of semiconductors. She personally led six young teachers to conduct experimental work.

The more than forty modern laboratories established by the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology in two years were all established with the help of Soviet experts Skolokhodov, Sokolov, Grigulyan, and others from design to installation. The Beijing Petroleum Institute has received assistance from more than ten Soviet experts in the three years since its establishment. After Soviet expert Belousov arrived at the school, he learned that the foundation for the oil storage and transportation specialty was weak and teachers had difficulty opening courses, so he rushed to write teaching materials, sometimes working past midnight.

Soviet expert Sulonov helped Peking University establish the discipline of higher nervous activity physiology. After he came to Peking University in early 1954, he gave teachers systematic lectures from basic higher nervous activity courses to specialized courses such as analyzer theory. He arranged further study directions according to each person's specific situation and personally guided more than twenty young teachers and graduate students in scientific research. He required each member of the teaching and research office to make at least one academic report per semester in conjunction with the further study plan. Now young teachers have mastered an experimental study related to the physiology of higher nervous activity, and a collective of scientific workers in this scientific field has been formed in the teaching and research office.

The expert Xie Man from the Electronic Physics Teaching and Research Office of the Physics Department of Peking University also brought the latest achievements of electron optics to all teachers. He personally chaired the discussion meetings, which were held three times a week and have continued uninterrupted for a year.

Soviet experts Golina and Manuilenco of Beijing Normal University are experts in preschool education theory. Now more than twenty teachers have systematically studied these specialties, and more than two thousand early childhood education workers across the country have attended their classes.

    苏联专家大力为我国培养人材
    北京各高等学校建立许多新的专业
    据新华社讯　北京各高等学校相继建立了许多新专业。在这一工作中，苏联专家付出了辛勤的劳动。
    在新学年里，清华大学、北京大学和北京农业大学等八个高等院校建立了一批新的专业。苏联专家齐斯佳科夫帮助清华大学动力系建立的热力设备自动化专门化，他计划在两年内培养出一批具有副博士水平的师资。苏联电视专家沙普雷金来到清华大学不久，就开出了有关电视方面的新课程。他亲自编写讲义，在讲课中提出目前各种电视设备中没有解决的问题以及可能解决的方案，使教师在学习这门新科学时有了努力的方向。在北京大学，苏联专家桑都诺娃开出了半导体方面范围很广的二十多个实验。她亲自领导着六个年青教师进行实验工作。
    北京钢铁工业学院在两年中建立的四十多个现代化实验室，都是苏联专家斯克洛霍多夫、索可洛夫、格里古良等人从设计到安装一手帮助建立起来的。北京石油学院在建校以来的三年中，得到十多个苏联专家的帮助。苏联专家别洛乌索夫到校后了解到关于石油储运专业方面的基础薄弱，教师们开课困难，他便赶写教材，有时工作到午夜以后。
    苏联专家苏洛诺夫帮助北京大学建立了高级神经活动生理学这门学科，他在1954年初来到北京大学后，从基础的高级神经活动课程起一直到分析器学说等专门课止，给教师们作了系统的讲授。他根据每个人的具体情况安排进修方向，亲自指导二十多个年青教师和研究生作科学研究工作。他要求教研室的每个成员每学期结合进修计划至少作一次学术报告。现在青年教师们都掌握了有关高级神经活动生理科学的一项实验研究，在教研室形成了这一门科学方面的科学工作者集体。
    北京大学物理系电子物理教研室的专家谢曼，也把电子光学的最新成就带给了全体教师。他亲自主持的讨论会，每周就有三次，一年来从不间断。
    北京师范大学的苏联专家戈林娜、玛努依连柯，是学前教育理论的专家。现在已有二十多个教师系统地学习了这些专业，全国有两千多个幼儿教育工作者都听过他们的课。
