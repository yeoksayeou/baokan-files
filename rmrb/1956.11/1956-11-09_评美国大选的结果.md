    Commentary on the Results of the US Election

    The American election, held every four years, has concluded. In a situation where voters could only choose between Republican and Democratic candidates, Eisenhower was re-elected as president.
    Eisenhower's re-election does not in any way indicate that American voters support the reactionary domestic and foreign policies pursued by the Republican government. On the contrary, the broad masses of the American people are demanding a change in this policy, demanding peace, democracy, civil rights, and economic stability. According to Western reports, Eisenhower's election was the result of the Republican bosses, taking advantage of the extremely undemocratic election system, flowery rhetoric about "peace and prosperity," and Eisenhower's "personal prestige," in a situation where American voters generally expressed aversion and unease towards the current policies of both parties. The recent pretense of peace by the US government in the tense situation in the Middle East, and the forced ceasefire by Britain and France, also "helped President Eisenhower win more votes in his re-election campaign" (Reuters). In reality, the US government has adopted a more hidden and insidious approach in the Middle East, attempting to squeeze out Britain and France, suppress the national independence movements of Arab countries, and establish American colonial rule in the Middle East.
    The general reaction from all sides is that the outcome of this election will not affect current US policy. Associated Press reporter Hightower also said, "Eisenhower's re-election means that the main direction of American policy remains: the kind of direction that has been worked hard to formulate over the past four years." But in "how to handle foreign policy actions," it will be "particularly cautious," that is, to implement aggressive policies with more tricks and conspiracies. Therefore, in order to safeguard peace and security, the people of all countries need to continue the irreconcilable struggle against the US policy of aggression and war with greater vigilance and determination.
    It is worth noting that this US election cannot but reflect the enormous changes that have taken place in the international situation, and the severe difficulties encountered by the current US foreign and domestic policies. The "policy of strength" pursued by the Republican government for the past four years has met setbacks everywhere, its infamous "liberation" policy of subverting the people's democratic countries has also suffered heavy blows, and the international status and prestige of the United States have been greatly reduced. At the same time, domestically, the persecution of McCarthyism, the anti-labor and anti-communist tyranny, the racial discrimination and lynching, and the decline in the lives of farmers caused by the long-term agricultural crisis have further aroused strong dissatisfaction among the masses with the government's policies. Faced with this situation, the Republican government had to try its best to flaunt "peace and prosperity" in an attempt to deceive the people and divert attention from the extremely unfavorable situation. But it is unwilling to change current policies, nor can it come up with practical solutions to deal with the current unfavorable situation. Democratic candidate Stevenson used these facts to attack the Republican Party and made more promises of peace and progress. His proposal to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons and to stop conscription hit the current government's sore spot of frantically expanding the atomic arms race, winning the favor of ordinary voters. This increased the Democratic Party's campaign capital to some extent, and gained an advantage in the gubernatorial and congressional elections, allowing it to continue to be the majority party in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. However, the platform put forward by the Democratic Party in the campaign did not have a fundamental difference from the Republican Party, and there were no signs of any change in the reactionary common policy of the two parties. Stevenson's eloquent campaign speeches were still full of the Cold War stench of anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and imperialist expansion.
    Under such circumstances, the two-party election game played by the American monopoly capital group cannot but appear increasingly senile. On October 11, the Associated Press reported that the campaign activities "have been very lifeless for a long time," and the "long-deceived" American public "lacked interest" in them. Despite the various sensational campaign tactics used by the two parties' candidates, the noisy and crazy propaganda, and the countless "dream" -like promises, the voters' mood still could not be "cheered up." Of the more than 100 million eligible voters, only more than 57 million people voted, and Eisenhower received only more than 33 million votes. This is by no means accidental. American voters are increasingly losing confidence in the Republican government's continued flaunting of "peace and prosperity," and the Democratic Party's bad reputation during its past rule cannot be erased from the voters' memories because of the many eloquent speeches made by its candidates this time. However, under the extremely undemocratic election system, American voters have no other choice, and the American monopoly capital group can still arbitrarily send its favorite political agents into the White House.
    However, it can be seen from this election that in the United States, peace has penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people and is increasingly becoming an important factor in American political life. An increasing number of sober-minded people in the United States have warned that ignoring this sentiment of millions of people will not have good results. Equally noteworthy is that the broad masses of workers, farmers, blacks, and all peace and democratic forces in the United States actively launched independent political activities during the election, and the mass struggle for peace, democratic freedom, civil rights, and economic stability has developed. The American people will one day see through the reactionary ruling group's means of deception, deception, and division by all possible means, and firmly grasp the destiny of the country in their own hands.

### 评美国大选的结果

    评美国大选的结果
    四年一次的美国大选已经揭晓。在选民只能在共和党和民主党候选人之间进行选择的情况下，艾森豪威尔当选连任总统。
    艾森豪威尔的重新当选，决不说明美国选民对共和党政府所奉行的反动的内外政策的支持，而相反地美国广大人民是要求改变这个政策，要求和平、民主、公民权利和经济稳定。据西方的报道，艾森豪威尔的当选，是在美国选民对现行两党政策普遍表示厌恶和不安的情况下，共和党的后台老板利用极不民主的选举制度、关于“和平和繁荣”的花言巧语，以及艾森豪威尔的“个人声望”而取得的结果。最近美国政府在中东紧张局势中标榜和平，英法被迫宣布停火，也“帮助了艾森豪威尔总统在他的连任竞选运动中赢得了更多的选票”（路透社）。实际上美国政府在中东采取了一种更为隐蔽和阴险的手法，企图排挤英法，压制阿拉伯国家的民族独立运动，建立美国在中东的殖民统治。
    各方的反应普遍认为，这次的大选结果不会影响美国的现行政策。美联社记者海托华也说，“艾森豪威尔重新当选意味着美国政策的主要方针仍然是：过去四年所努力制定的那种方针”。但是在“如何处理外交政策行动”的时候将“特别慎重”，也就是以更多的花样和诡计来执行侵略性的政策。因此，为了维护和平和安全，各国人民就需要以更大的警惕和坚定性，来继续同美国的侵略和战争政策作不可调和的斗争。
    值得注意的是，这次美国大选不能不反映出国际局势已经发生巨大变化、美国现行的外交和国内政策遭到重重困难的情况。四年来共和党政府执行的“实力政策”，已经到处碰壁，它的臭名远扬的颠复人民民主国家的“解放”政策，也受到沉重的打击，美国的国际地位和威信大大地降低了。同时，在国内，麦卡锡主义的迫害，反劳工反共的虐政，种族主义的歧视和私刑，以及长期农业危机所造成的农民生活的下降，更加引起了人民群众对政府政策的强烈不满。面对这种形势，共和党政府不得不竭力标榜“和平和繁荣”，企图借此欺骗人民，转移对它十分不利的形势。但是它又不愿意改变现行政策，也提不出应付当前不利局面的实际办法来。民主党候选人史蒂文森利用这些事实，大肆攻击共和党，并作出了更多的和平和进步的诺言。他提出的停止原子武器、氢武器试验和停止征兵的主张，打中了现政府疯狂扩大原子军备竞赛的痛处，博得了普通选民的好感。这曾使得民主党的竞选资本有所增加，并在州长和议员选举中取得了优势，使它继续在参众两院中居于多数党的地位。可是，民主党在竞选中提出的政纲同共和党并无基本分歧，反动的两党共同政策没有任何改变的迹象。史蒂文森在动听的竞选言论中也依旧充满着反苏反共和帝国主义扩张的冷战臭味。
    在这种情况下，美国垄断资本集团玩弄的两党竞选把戏，不能不越来越显得暮气沉沉。10月11日美联社报道说，竞选活动“长期以来非常没有生气”，“长期受骗”的美国公众对之“缺乏兴趣”。尽管两党候选人使用了种种耸人听闻的竞选手法，吵吵嚷嚷的疯狂宣传，和发出数不清的“梦想”般的诺言，但选民的情绪还是“振作”不起来。在已经超过一亿的适龄选民中，投票的人数不过五千七百多万人，艾森豪威尔获得的选票只有三千三百多万张。这决不是偶然的。美国选民对共和党政府继续标榜“和平和繁荣”日益失掉信心，民主党过去执政时的坏名声，也并不因为它的候选人这次发出的许多动听言论而能使选民淡忘。但是在极不民主的选举制度下，美国选民不能有别的抉择，美国垄断资本集团仍可以随意把自己喜爱的政治代理人送进白宫。
    但是，从这次大选可以看出，在美国，和平已经深入人心，并日益成为美国政治生活中的一个重要因素。美国越来越多的清醒人士纷纷发出警告说，忽视千百万人民的这种心情是不会有好结果的。同样值得重视的是，美国广大的劳工、农民、黑人以及一切和平民主力量，在大选期间积极地展开了独立的政治活动，争取和平、民主自由、公民权利和经济稳定的群众性斗争有了发展。美国人民终有一天会识破反动统治集团千方百计地进行的蒙蔽、欺骗和分化的手段，把国家的命运紧紧地掌握在自己的手里。
