    Save the Forests
    In recent months, the phenomenon of indiscriminate logging has occurred in some forest areas of Fujian Province. In Nan'an County, 200,000 trees were felled indiscriminately in May and June. Among the trees felled were many saplings and mother trees. In Xuqi Township, Shaowu County, the entire township had only over 400,000 bamboo plants. This time, except for leaving 4,000 to 5,000 mother bamboo plants, all the rest, even the one- or two-year-old young forests, were completely cut down. Recently, farmers in Zhangpu, Haicheng, and other counties, in addition to indiscriminately logging large quantities of trees on the mountains, have also cut down the roadside and scenic forests in scenic areas, and even dug up the roots of valuable trees such as camphor and nanmu after they were felled. In Shangduan Township, Minhou County, more than 300 members were recently mobilized to enter the forest area and cut down any bamboo they saw, even 400 or more tender green bamboo plants that had only been growing for half a year.
    Indiscriminate logging has brought serious consequences to mountain production and the lives of the masses. This year, many coastal areas of Fujian have experienced difficulties in seed collection due to the destruction of forest resources and the sharp reduction of mother trees, which has affected the development of afforestation work. The act of destroying forests has also frustrated the enthusiasm of the masses for forestry production. After the trees in Luoyuan Township, Minhou County, were indiscriminately felled, the masses said, "Four years of afforestation is not enough for one year of destruction. What's the point of planting now!" Therefore, they did not go to clear weeds in the forest land during the weeding season, nor were they willing to tend to the existing young forests.
    The emergence of these phenomena of destroying trees is by no means accidental. In leading production in many areas, rural cadres one-sidedly emphasize increasing current income, disregarding long-term interests, and only emphasize engaging in sideline occupations to earn more money, mobilizing the masses to go into the mountains to seek treasure, without combining it with education on protecting forest resources. The work groups in four townships in Jiangle County even proposed the slogan of attacking the forests to the masses. In just a few months, the farmers in the four townships went up the mountains and swept away all the fir trees, regardless of size or quality.
    The blind purchase of forest products by timber harvesting units and some commercial departments has also fueled the phenomenon of indiscriminate logging by the masses. The bamboo forest stock in Luoyuan Township, Minhou County, is only 11,000 dan, but the purchasing group has allocated a purchase task of 15,000 dan. The Dongyou District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jian'ou County recently went to Zhangdang Township to purchase 10,000 jin of tung oil bark. As a result, the masses cut down and stripped the bark of all 300 tung trees to sell. The Yong'an County Supply and Marketing Cooperative recently purchased 200,000 jin of tung bark, so the farmers almost cut down all the tung bark in the county.
    The occurrence of indiscriminate logging is also closely related to the improper handling of the issue of production cooperatives' forest land entering the cooperative in some areas. Some cooperatives arbitrarily lowered prices when forest land entered the cooperative, infringing on the rights and interests of forest owners. At the congress for the establishment of the advanced cooperative in Zhangting Township, Jinjiang County, the head of the production cooperative announced that from tomorrow onwards, all mountain forests would be under the jurisdiction of the entire cooperative. Therefore, that night, all the members called their wives and children to go up the mountains to indiscriminately fell trees in large quantities.
    In order to prevent man-made disasters from developing, let's save the forests quickly!　Wu Youcheng

### 救救森林

    救救森林
    近几个月来，福建省部分林区发生了乱砍乱伐森林的现象。南安县五、六月份乱砍林木达二十万株。被砍掉的林木中，有不少幼树和母树。邵武县徐溪乡全乡只有竹林四十多万株，这次除了留下四、五千株母竹以外，其余连一、二年生的幼林都全部砍光。漳浦、海澄等县的农民最近除了上山大量乱砍乱伐以外，把道路旁的和风景区的风景林都砍光，樟木、楠木等贵重树木被砍下后，连树根都挖掉。闽侯县上塅乡最近发动了三百多个社员进入林区见竹就砍，连刚生长半年的幼嫩青竹也被砍了四百多株。
    乱砍乱伐给山区生产和群众生活带来了严重的后患。今年福建沿海许多地区由于森林资源被破坏，母树大大减少，采种感到困难，影响造林工作的开展。破坏森林的行为也挫折了群众的林业生产积极性，闽侯县罗源乡林木被乱砍后群众说：“四年造林不够一年毁，现在造它干什么！”因而到林地劈草季节也不去劈草，对现有幼林也不肯去抚育。
    这些破坏林木的现象的产生，决不是偶然的。许多地区农村干部在领导生产中，片面强调增加目前收入，不顾长远利益，只强调搞副业多赚钱，发动群众进山取宝，没有结合进行保护森林资源的教育。将乐县的四个乡工作组甚至向群众提出向森林进攻的口号，只几个月的时间，四个乡农民上山把杉木不分大小好坏一扫而光。
    木材采伐单位和某些商业部门盲目收购林产品，也助长了群众乱砍乱伐的现象。闽侯县罗源乡竹林蓄积量只有一万一千担，而采购组分配收购任务却达一万五千担。建瓯县东游区供销社最近到张壋乡收购一万斤油桐皮，结果，群众把三百株桐树全部砍死剥皮出卖。永安县供销社最近收购了二十万斤桐皮，因而农民们几乎把全县油桐皮都砍光了。
    乱砍乱伐现象的发生，同某些地区对生产合作社林木入社问题处理不当也有密切关系。有的社在林木入社时任意压价，侵犯林主权益，晋江县张亭乡生产社社长在成立高级社大会上宣布从明天起山林统归全社，因此，当夜全部社员呼妻唤子上山大量滥伐林木。
    为了不让人为的灾害发展下去，快些救救森林吧！　吴又成
