Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 13th. TASS, Cairo, 13th: The Director of the Egyptian Intelligence Service, Hatem, said on the evening of November 12th that, according to experts from the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority, it would take four months for the canal to return to normal navigation.

Hatem said that the aggression by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel not only brought losses to Egypt, but also to many other countries. Because British and French aircraft dropped many bombs in Egypt, several ships sank in the Suez Canal. In order to prevent the Egyptian armed forces from leaving the Sinai Peninsula, the Anglo-French reactionaries bombed the Firdan Bridge and other military bridges on the Suez Canal.

Hatem pointed out that as a result of the British and French air raids on the Suez Canal, twelve ships of various countries were blocked. These ships were transporting goods from Europe to Asia. The scene after the Firdan Bridge on the Suez Canal was destroyed by the British Air Force.

    埃及情报司司长说
    英法侵略者破坏了运河通航
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社开罗13日讯：埃及情报司司长哈特姆11月12日晚间说，据埃及苏伊士运河管理局的专家鉴定，运河要恢复正常通航需要四个月的时间。
    哈特姆说，英、法、以三国的侵略不仅给埃及带来了损失，而且也给其他许多国家带来了损失。由于英国和法国飞机在埃及扔下了许多炸弹，苏伊士运河上有几只船沉掉了。英法反动派为了阻挠埃及武装部队离开西奈半岛，轰炸了菲尔丹桥和苏伊士运河上其他的军用桥梁。
    哈特姆指出，由于英法飞机轰炸苏伊士运河，结果有十二艘各国的船只被封锁住了。这些船只是从欧洲往亚洲运货的。苏伊士运河上的菲尔丹大桥被英国空军炸毁后的景况。
