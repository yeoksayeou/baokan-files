Xinhua News Agency, 2nd, Cairo - Egyptian President Nasser, in a radio address to the nation from Cairo Radio on November 1, said, "Egypt will wage a total war against the tripartite alliance of Britain, France, and Israel in order to defend its freedom and independence."

	He said that Egypt had declared that it would fight forever to defend its sovereignty and freedom. We will fight against the oppressor forces that want to violate our freedom.

	He said, we are defending Egypt's honor, Egypt's freedom, and Egypt's dignity.

	Nasser said in a calm and serious voice, we will wage a major war—this war will be waged by the Egyptian people and the Egyptian forces side by side.

	He called on the people to assist the army in completing its mission. He said: "When the people are awakened and willing to sacrifice their lives, they will always be victorious, even if the enemies who attack them outnumber them. The power of the people is always invincible."

	He pointed out that there have been precedents of small countries with limited resources fighting against great powers. Yugoslavia fought victoriously against Germany's armored forces with small arms, and Germany eventually collapsed. Greece fought and won. Indonesia fought and won. Now you have your Algerian brothers fighting against 500,000 French troops for their freedom. In Cyprus, they are fighting British and French troops for their freedom.

	Nasser said, "We are writing a new page in Egyptian history. We now need patience and confidence to achieve victory. I assure you that I will fight with you for your freedom until the last drop of my blood is shed."

	President Nasser pointed out that Britain, France, and Israel colluded to deal with Egypt, and Egypt was attacked for no reason. At present, the common goal of Britain, France, and Israel is to eliminate our main force. "The conspiracy is now very clear: the Anglo-French-Israeli alliance wants to destroy our air force and isolate our troops in Sinai."

	Nasser said: "Britain, France, and Israel disregard the principles of the United Nations and trample on the UN Charter. Their air force is bombing Cairo and the Canal Zone, attempting to cause panic among the Egyptian people. But they are wrong. They underestimate the patriotic actions of our people who are enthusiastically defending their independence."

	Nasser continued: "At this decisive moment, we have chosen a decision based on honor and dignity. Choosing a decision that means humiliation is unimaginable. Colonialists will never consider your happiness. Now, they are infringing on us, trying to hinder our plans to realize our revival and develop our economy for the happiness of the Egyptian people and for their liberation."

	Nasser said that their aggression was unjustified. They instigated Israel to launch an attack and put it in a dilemma, which it would bitterly regret afterwards. We believe that as long as you have patience and confidence, you will be able to withstand all tests.

	Nasser said to the Egyptian people: "Each of you, my compatriots, is a soldier of the National Liberation Army. We have ordered the distribution of weapons, and we have many weapons. We will fight a fierce war. We will fight from village to village, from place to place, because every one of your compatriots is a soldier who participates in the armed forces to defend our honor, our dignity, and our freedom."

	He said: "We will fight, and we will never lay down our arms."

    纳赛尔号召每一个埃及人拿起武器来
    为保卫埃及的自由独立进行总体战
    指出人民的力量是不可战胜的，现在需要有获取胜利的耐心和信心
    新华社2日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统纳赛尔11月1日在开罗电台向全国发表的广播演说中说，“埃及为了保卫它的自由和独立，将对英国、法国和以色列三国联盟进行总体战”。
    他说，埃及已经宣布它将永远为了保卫它的主权和自由而战。我们将同要想侵犯我们的自由的压迫者部队作战。
    他说，我们正在维护埃及的荣誉，埃及的自由和埃及的尊严。
    纳赛尔以镇定而严肃的声音说，我们将进行一次重大的战争——这次战争将由埃及人民和埃及部队并肩进行。
    他号召人民协助军队完成任务。他说：“当人民觉悟了，并且愿意牺牲自己生命的时候，他们总是会胜利的，即使是向他们发动进攻的敌人在数量上超过了他们。人民的力量始终是不可战胜的。”
    他指出，曾经有过只有有限资源的小国同大国作战的先例。南斯拉夫以小型武器胜利地同德国的装甲部队作战，而德国结果垮台了。希腊进行了战斗而获得了胜利。印度尼西亚进行了战斗而获得了胜利。现在你们有阿尔及利亚兄弟为了他们自由的缘故在同五十万法国军队作战。在塞浦路斯，他们正在为了他们的自由而同英国军队和法国军队作战。
    纳赛尔说：“我们正在写下埃及历史中的新的一页。我们现在需要获得胜利的耐心和信心。我向你们保证，我将为了你们的自由同你们一起战斗到流尽我的最后一滴血。”
    纳赛尔总统指出，英国、法国和以色列串通起来对付埃及，埃及无端遭到攻击。目前英法和以色列的共同目标是消灭我们的主力。“阴谋现在是很清楚了：英法以三国联盟想毁灭我们的空军，使我们在西奈的部队陷于孤立地位。”
    纳赛尔说：“英、法和以色列三国无视联合国组织的原则，践踏联合国宪章。他们的空军在空袭开罗和运河区，企图引起埃及人民的惊惶失措。但是他们错了，他们对于热情捍卫自己的独立的我国人民的爱国行动估计不足。”
    纳赛尔继续说：“在这种决定性的关头，我们选择了立足于荣誉和尊严的决定。选择那种意味着屈辱的决定，这是不可想像的。殖民主义者决不会考虑到你们的幸福，现在，他们正在侵犯我们，企图阻挠我们为埃及人民的幸福、为他们的解放而实现我们的复兴和发展经济的计划。”
    纳赛尔说，它们的侵略是毫无道理的。它们嗾使以色列发动进攻，并且使它处于进退维谷的境地，对于这件事，它事后会沉痛地后悔的。我们相信，只要你们有耐心和信心，你们就能经得住一切考验。
    纳赛尔对埃及全国人民说：“你们每一个人，我的同胞，都是民族解放军的战士。我们已经下令发给武器，我们的武器很多。我们将打一场激烈的战争。我们将从一个村打到另一个村，从一地打到另一地，因为你们同胞每一个都是参加武装部队维护我们的荣誉、维护我们的尊严、维护我们的自由的战士。”
    他说：“我们要战斗，我们决不放下武器。”
