    Greenhouse Built Using Industrial Waste Gas
    (Our newspaper reports) Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province, has built a greenhouse using industrial waste gas. This greenhouse currently has an area of 2,000 square meters and is the first greenhouse in our country to produce vegetables using industrial waste gas heat. The appearance of this greenhouse is similar to an ordinary coal-burning glass greenhouse, with iron pipes installed inside to circulate warm air for insulation, and large heating pipes installed underground. It has stronger insulation and a larger conduction surface than ordinary greenhouses. When the outdoor temperature is minus 40 degrees Celsius, the indoor temperature can still be maintained at a certain level, preventing freezing.
    This greenhouse was built using waste materials from local factories, and the heat source is also factory waste gas, so the production cost is relatively low.
    Just as snowflakes are falling in Qiqihar, the "May Fresh" cowpeas planted in this greenhouse are already being harvested to meet the needs of industrial and mining areas. Cucumbers and peppers have also been transplanted. Thousands of tomato plants are growing particularly lushly, some are already flowering and fruiting, and will soon be available on the market.
    This year, this waste gas heated greenhouse plans to produce 104,800 jin of vegetables, including Shandong and Beijing cucumbers, tomatoes, green peppers, cowpeas, and garlic sprouts. The production volume will account for more than 40% of the local market supply. (Attached picture)

    利用工业废气建造的温室
    本报讯　黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市利用工业废气建造了一座温室。这座温室现有面积二千平方公尺，是我国利用工业废气热生产蔬菜的第一座温室。这座温室的外形同普通烧煤的玻璃温室相似，内部装置铁管通以暖气保温，地下设有大温管。它比普通温室保温力强，传导面大。在室外温度为摄氏零下四十度的时候，室内也能保持一定的温度，不致结冰。
    这座温室是利用当地工厂的废料建成的，热源又是用的工厂废气，因此生产成本比较低。
    正当齐齐哈尔飘起雪花的时候，在这座温室里种植的“五月鲜”豆角已经可以采摘供应工矿区的需要了。黄瓜、辣椒也已经定植。几千棵西红柿生长得特别繁茂，有的已经在开花结果，很快就可以供应市场。
    今年这座废气热温室计划生产十万四千八百斤蔬菜，品种有山东和北京的黄瓜，有西红柿、青椒、豆角、蒜苗等。生产量将占当地市场供应量的40％以上。（附图片）
