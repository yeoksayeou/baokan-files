    On the Eve of the Olympic Games
    By Our Correspondent Hu Qi
    Melbourne, on the southernmost tip of the Australian continent, is extraordinarily busy. In addition to the city's more than 1.5 million residents, tens of thousands of athletes and travelers are pouring in from overseas and across the country, exacerbating traffic congestion and the housing shortage in the city's bustling downtown area. But many Australians and the Olympic Organizing Committee have made great efforts, and Melbourne is ready to welcome athletes and travelers from more than seventy countries.
    The Olympic Games emblem is dotted everywhere on the streets and alleys. A large torch made up of thousands of pieces of glass hangs at a major intersection in the city center, reflecting colorful lights at night. National flags flutter on buildings in the downtown area, symbolizing the peaceful and friendly coexistence of different countries. Shops are posting various Olympic advertisements, and the Olympic five-ring emblem has become the most popular trademark for all kinds of goods. People are talking about the upcoming Olympic Games everywhere. On the streets and in the suburbs, cyclists can be seen practicing before the competition. Newspapers report on the selection trials of the Australian delegation and the arrival of foreign delegations with huge space and large headlines. The change in clothing is the most striking, with women wearing Olympic-style clothing.
    The various stadiums are undergoing final preparations to ensure that they are fully suitable for competition. The central stadium, converted from a cricket field, can accommodate more than 100,000 spectators. The opening ceremony of the 16th Olympic Games will be held here.
    An Olympic Village has been built on a large piece of land eight miles northeast of the city center. It is planned to accommodate four to five thousand athletes and accompanying staff. Most of the houses in the village are bungalows or two-story buildings. These houses are small residences designed to accommodate one or two families. It is said that after the Olympic Games, they will be rented to local people who lack housing. The houses are built in a simple style, with good ventilation, plenty of light, and some modern equipment, such as gas stoves for cooking and heating, beds with wire mattresses and soft blankets, and bathrooms. The houses are built in groups and will be allocated according to the circumstances of each delegation. According to the plan, the Chinese delegation will reside in a group of houses at the very back of the village, surrounded by the residences of several Asian national delegations. The village has various service facilities, such as snack bars, restaurants, department stores, hospitals, banks, training grounds, news and shopping centers, and so on. All female athletes live in a separate area. It is said that the Olympic Committee has hired 2,000 staff to manage the entire village and provide various services to the athletes.
    On the morning of the 29th, the Chairman of the Olympic Organizing Committee, Kent Hughes, officially announced the opening of the Olympic Village. The national flags of the seven national delegations that had already moved in were raised in front of the village gate. These seven countries are Hungary, Ceylon, Malaya, France, Nigeria, Greece and Australia. After a small group of Kuomintang personnel from Taiwan shouted for a while, the Kuomintang flag was actually raised. However, their status is illegal. Only the Chinese Olympic National Delegation is the legal representative of Chinese athletes. They were selected from nationwide selection trials, including three athletes from Hong Kong and Macau, who are now gathering in Guangzhou, preparing to set off for Melbourne.
    The newly built swimming pool has a unique style in architecture. Contrary to ordinary buildings, it is not built in a planar shape, but like a fan, hence it gets a special name "Half-Air Sling", meaning that a hook in the sky is hanging it up. The designers of this swimming pool were some young architects who had graduated from the University of Melbourne a few years ago. They won awards for their brilliant design. Mr. Bolan, one of these architects, was proud of his achievements and enthusiastically explained to the visiting Chinese journalists how the swimming pool was built. In his conversation with us, he strongly expressed his desire to communicate with Chinese construction engineers, and he especially emphasized the importance of close cooperation between scientists from various countries. He said that he was deeply moved by the news of the large-scale construction work being carried out in China.
    Since coming to Australia, I have often met many people who care about China and asked about the Chinese Olympic delegation, its competition events, and the results it may achieve. They were surprised by the Chinese delegation composed of more than 90 outstanding athletes and its superior ability in several sports. Ordinary Australian people have good feelings towards the Chinese people. As soon as they talk about the Chinese delegation, they express their heartfelt welcome. Many times, some ordinary Australians talked to me about the traditional friendship between the people of the two countries. They said that even when they were young, they fell in love with China and its peaceful people who are famous for their hospitality. People who have been to China in recent years are particularly touched by the friendly enthusiasm shown by the Chinese people. They believe that it is extremely foolish not to befriend the Chinese people or to recognize its legitimate position in world affairs.
    However, as a taxi driver said, not everyone in Australia cares about the Chinese people in this way. His conclusion is based on reason. It is very surprising that the Australian people know so little about Chinese sports and the current real situation in China. What is even more noteworthy is that although the Olympic Charter stipulates that each country can only have one delegation, two flags are raised for China somewhere in the Olympic Village, and the name of China is written in two different titles. These and others are confusing people and giving them wrong ideas about China. Fair observers have every reason to believe that some people are pretending not to be involved in politics, but in fact they are playing political tricks on the Chinese people's right to send a delegation to participate in the Olympic Games, thus constituting interference in China's internal affairs.
    People rightly associate these situations with the private visit of Allen Dulles, the head of the US intelligence agency, to Australia. People attach great importance to the protest recently lodged by Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the Chinese Olympic Committee, to the International Olympic Committee. He exposed the conspiracy of some people trying to create a non-existent "China." This conspiracy also violates the Olympic Charter regarding accepting delegations from only one country. Now it remains to be seen what attitude the International Olympic Committee will ultimately take on this. (Melbourne, 31st)

    在奥林匹克运动会前夕
    本报记者　胡骑
    澳大利亚大陆最南端的墨尔本，忙碌异常。除本市一百五十万以上居民外，成千上万的运动家和旅客纷纷从海外和国内各地涌进这已很拥挤的城市，使得城市闹区交通堵塞和房荒情况更加严重。但是许多澳大利亚人和奥林匹克组织委员会还是尽了很大努力，墨尔本已准备好接待来自七十多个国家的运动家和旅客。
    大街小巷到处点缀着奥林匹克大会的徽号。在市中心主要十字路口上，悬挂着一根由千数百片玻璃组成的大火炬，在夜里反射出五光十色的光芒。在市中心区的大厦上，飘扬着各国的旗帜，象征着不同国家之间的和平友好共处。商店纷纷张贴出形形色色的奥林匹克广告，奥林匹克的五环会徽成了各种商品最流行的商标。人们到处谈论着即将到来的奥林匹克竞赛。在各条大街上和郊区，可以看到自行车手们进行着竞赛前的练习。报纸以巨大的篇幅和大号标题报道澳大利亚代表队的选拔赛和外国代表队到达的消息。服装的变化最为醒目，妇女们穿上了奥林匹克款式的衣着。
    各个运动场都在进行最后的整理工作，使之完全适于竞赛之用。由板球场改建成的中央运动场，可容十万余名观众。十六届奥林匹克大会的开幕式将在这里举行。
    在市中心东北八哩外的一片大地上，建筑起一座奥林匹克村。它计划接待四、五千名运动家和随行的工作人员。村里的房屋大部分是平房或两层楼的楼房。这些房子都是按照住居一家或两家人来设计的小住宅，据说在奥林匹克大会结束后，将分租给当地缺乏房屋的人民居住。房屋建筑得很朴素，通风良好，光线充足，还有些现代化设备，如烧饭取暖的煤气炉、有钢丝褥和柔软毯子的床铺、洗澡间等等。房子按一组一组地建成，将根据各个代表队的情况来分配。按照计划，中国代表队住居在村的正后面的一组房屋里，四周是几个亚洲国家代表队的住所。村里有各种服务设备，如小吃店、餐厅、百货店、医院、银行、练习场、新闻和商店中心等等。所有女运动员都住在单独辟出来的一个地区里。据说奥林匹克委员会雇用了两千名工作人员负责管理整个村子，为运动员们提供各种服务。
    29日早上，奥林匹克组织委员会主席肯特·休斯正式宣布奥林匹克村开幕。村子大门前升起了已经住进去的七个国家代表队的国旗。这七个国家是匈牙利、锡兰、马来亚、法国、尼日利亚、希腊和澳大利亚。在一小撮台湾的国民党人员一阵叫嚷以后，居然也升起了国民党的旗帜。但是，他们的地位是非法的。只有中国的奥林匹克国家代表队才是中国运动员的合法代表，他们是从全国性的选拔赛中选拔出来的，其中包括三名香港、澳门地区的运动员，现在正在广州集合，准备启程到墨尔本来。
    新建的游泳馆在建筑上独具一种风格。和一般的建筑物相反，它不是按照平面型建造的，而是像一把扇子，因此得到一个特有的名字“半空吊”，意思是说，一个天上的钩子把它吊起来的。这个游泳馆的设计者一些是刚从墨尔本大学毕业不上几年的青年建筑师，他们因为自己的这个光辉设计而得奖。这些建筑师之一的波尔兰先生，为自己的成就而感到骄傲，并激动地向参观的中国记者们讲解这个游泳场是怎样建成的。在跟我们谈话中，他强烈地表示了愿和中国的建筑工程师们交往的愿望，他特别强调各国的科学家的密切合作的重要性。他说，他深为在中国所进行的大规模建设工作的消息所感动。
    自从来到澳大利亚，我常常遇到许多关心中国的人问到关于中国的奥林匹克代表队、它的竞赛项目、可能达到的成绩等问题。他们对于由九十多名优秀运动家组成的中国代表队及其在若干运动项目上已经表现出的优越的能力等情况，感到惊奇。普通的澳大利亚人民对中国人民有良好的情感。只要一谈到中国代表队，他们就表示衷心的欢迎。有好多次，一些普通的澳大利亚人跟我谈起了两国人民之间的友谊传统。他们说，甚至在他们小的时候，他们就爱上了中国和它的以好客闻名的和平的人民。近几年当中到过中国的人们，对中国人民所表露出来的友好热情特别表示感动。他们认为，不跟中国人民交朋友、或者不承认它在世界事务中的合法地位，是极端愚蠢的。
    但是，正如一个出租汽车司机所说的，在澳大利亚并不是每个人都对中国人民这样关心的。他的这个结论是有根据的。令人十分惊讶的是，澳大利亚人民对中国的体育运动和目前中国的真实情况，所知甚少。更值得注意的是，尽管奥林匹克会章上规定，每个国家只能有一个代表队，但是在奥林匹克村里的某处却为中国升起了两面旗，中国的名字被写成两个不同的称号。这些以及其他，都在迷惑人民，使他们对中国产生错误的概念。公正的观察家完全有理由认为：某些人装成不过问政治的样子，而实际上却正在对中国人民派遣一个代表队参加奥林匹克竞赛的权利玩弄政治诡计，因而构成了对中国内政的干涉。
    人们正当地把这些情况跟美国情报局头子艾伦·杜勒斯的私访澳大利亚联系起来。人们很重视中国奥林匹克委员会秘书长荣高棠最近向国际奥林匹克委员会所提出的抗议。他揭露某些人正企图制造一个根本不存在的“中国”的阴谋。这个阴谋也是违反关于只接受一个国家的代表队的奥林匹克会章的。现在要看国际奥林匹克委员会最后对此采取什么态度。（墨尔本31日电）
