Title: The Net Casters

　　In the morning, a light blue mist had just risen from the sea. A small wooden boat that could hold six or seven people pulled a net rope and rowed towards the shallows. Soon, the people on the wooden boat jumped into the shallow seawater, pulling the net rope towards the beach like trackers, as if afraid the waves would catch up with them.

　　These are the fishermen of the Qingdao Taixi Fishery Cooperative catching fish on the beach, pulling the net...

　　I stood to one side, not seeing where the other end of the net rope was.

　　"How big is your net?"

　　"One hundred fifty or sixty twists!" An old fisherman with a thick black beard, realizing I didn't understand, added, "About seventy or eighty *zhang*!"

　　"How many fish can you catch in one net?"

　　The old fisherman with the black beard looked at me with a smile, not answering. He seemed very mysterious.

　　It was indeed a mystery: in such a wide expanse of sea, after casting this net, who could accurately calculate how many fish could be caught?

　　A young man standing behind the old fisherman, pulling the net rope, with his trouser legs rolled up to his thighs, laughed loudly and said:

　　"In the past, we caught four or five hundred *jin* in one net..." His tone and expression were very heroic.

　　Perhaps the young fisherman's words stirred something in the old fisherman's mind. He chuckled and then said:

　　"We live off the mountain if we're near it, and live off the sea if we're near it!"

　　"Fifth Uncle!" the young fisherman looked up and shouted: "Why are you talking about living off the sea again! More work, more gain, don't you know that!"

　　The old fisherman, called Fifth Uncle, didn't say anything. He lowered his head and continued pulling the net. At this moment, I saw a row of bamboo floats on the surface of the sea. The five people pulling the net on this side were shouting loudly to the four people pulling the net on the other side:

　　"Tighten it up, tighten it up!"

　　It looked like the net was closing and would soon be dragged onto the beach.

　　Suddenly, a shiny, ribbon-like long fish jumped out of the water, followed by another, and another, ah, the fish all jumped outside the bamboo floats and escaped. There must be a lot of fish in this net.

　　I couldn't help but say to the young fisherman:

　　"This net must have four or five hundred *jin*!"

　　This time he just smiled without replying, as if afraid that if he spoke, he would scare the four or five hundred *jin* of fish away. He just desperately pulled the net rope. Then the nine of them moved closer and closer together, closing the mouth of the net. All nine of them stood in the shallow water, bending their backs.

　　How many fish were caught after all? This was a tense moment! Ignoring the incoming tide, I ran towards the fishing net.

　　"How many fish did you catch?" I asked as I ran.

　　The young fisherman shook the net and said very lightly:

　　"Only thirty or forty *jin*!"

　　I saw only a dozen white ribbonfish and a few reddish mullet jumping in the net...

　　I was very disappointed. Just as I was about to say something, I heard the young fisherman shout:

　　"Let's do it twice more!" He seemed to be the leader of the group here.

　　The small wooden boat pulled the net out again. After circling around, the net rope was pulled back again, and the fishermen were pulling like trackers in tense silence. This time, I didn't ask, just quietly waited for the fishing net to come in.

　　The fishing net came in, and I went over to take a look. It was still those dozen or so long white ribbonfish.

　　"Still so few? Why don't you go fishing in the outer sea..."

　　The young fisherman team leader ignored me, but the old Fifth Uncle spoke:

　　"Our small boat and this net are for fishing in these shallows!..."

　　While speaking, he pulled the net rope out again.

　　That morning, I just kept watching here, once, twice, three times, four times, five times... and each time the fishing net was pulled back, there were only those dozen or so white ribbonfish. I became more and more annoyed. I even couldn't help but shout loudly when I saw them preparing to cast the net for the sixth time:

　　"Are you still casting the net?"

　　"Yes!" the old Fifth Uncle shouted at me: "Each time we cast the net, we always catch some fish!"

　　And the young fisherman team leader, who was angry beside him, also shouted an order:

　　"Cast it! One net will be full eventually!"

　　I was stunned by their words. As I watched the small wooden boat wobble and pull the net out again, I suddenly felt that these people were not pulling out a fishing net, and they were not casting a fishing net. What they were taking out was hope, and what they were casting out was hope. It seemed that they would not stop until they pulled back their hope.

　　Because of this, it has been so long, and I still can't forget these net casters.

    撒网的人
    柯蓝
    早晨，海上刚刚升起一层淡淡的蓝雾，一只能坐六七个人的小木船，拉着网绳朝浅滩这边划过来了。马上，木船上的人都跳进浅滩的海水里，像背纤似的拉着网绳朝沙滩上跑着、拉着，仿佛怕海浪追上了他们似的。
    这是青岛台西渔业合作社的渔民们在滨海沙滩捕鱼，拉网……
    我站在一边，没有看见网绳的另一头在哪里。
    “你们这网有多大呀？”
    “一百五六十搓！”一位年老的留着又黑又粗的胡子的渔民发现我没有听懂，又补了一句：“约莫七八十丈！”
    “你们一网能拉多少鱼呀！”
    这位有着黑胡子的老渔民，望着我笑笑，没有回话。出现一副很神秘的样子。
    这的确是一个谜：这么宽阔的海水，这一网撒下去，这又有谁能算准能打到多少鱼呢？
    一个站在老渔民后面拉网绳的青年，裤脚管挽到大腿上，大声笑着讲：
    “过去我们一网就打过四五百斤……”讲话的语气和脸上的表情都是很豪迈的。
    大概是这位青年渔民的话，引起了这位老渔民的心事，他呵了一声，接着说：
    “我们是靠山吃山，靠海吃海的呵！”
    “五爷！”那位青年渔民仰起脸来喊：“怎么又是靠海吃饭啰！多劳多得，你又不是不知道！”
    这位叫五爷的老渔民没有做声。低下头拉他的网去了。这时候我才看见海面上浮着一排上网的竹节筒。这边拉网的五个人朝着那边拉网的四个人在大声喊：
    “收紧啦，收紧啦！”
    看样子，网要收拢了，快拖上河滩来了。
    忽然，水面上凭空跳起一条闪亮的带子一般的长鱼，接着又是一条、两条，呵，鱼都跳到竹筒外面去了，跑掉了。这网里的鱼一定有不少呵。
    我忍不住对那位青年渔民说：
    “这一网怕有四五百斤啦！”
    这回他倒只是笑笑，没有回话，仿佛怕这一说话，把四五百斤鱼说跑了似的。他只是拚命地收网绳。接着他们九个人就都越靠越拢，把网口合拢起来了。九个人都站在浅水里把腰弯了下去。
    到底打了多少鱼呢？这是多紧张的时刻！我也不管涌来的潮水，就朝鱼网那边跑过去了。
    “打了多少鱼？”我一边跑一边问。
    青年渔民拉着网抖了一抖，很轻地说：
    “只有三四十斤！”
    我看见网里只有十几条白色的长刀鱼和几条发红的梭鱼在蹦在跳……
    我很失望。正想说什么，只听见这个青年渔民在喊：
    “再来二网！”看样子他还是这里的小组长咧。
    小木船又把网拉出去了。绕了一个大圈，又把网绳拉回来了，渔民们又在紧张地背纤似的拉着。这一回，我就不问了，在一旁静静地等着鱼网上来。
    鱼网上来了，我走过去一看，还是那十几条长长的白刀鱼。
    “还是这么少？你们为什么不到外海去打鱼咧……”
    青年渔民组长没有理睬我，倒是年老的五爷说话了：
    “我们这小船，这网，就是在这种浅滩打鱼的！……”
    说话中间，又把网绳拉出去了。
    这天上午，我就一直在这里看着，一次，两次，三次，四次，五次……而每次拉回来的鱼网里，都是那么十几条白刀鱼。我是越看越气了。甚至看见他们第六次又准备撒网了，我就忍不住大声说：
    “你们还撒网吗？”
    “撒呵！”年老的五爷大声对着我：“撒一次，我们总打到一些鱼的！”
    而正在旁边生气的青年渔民小组长，也跟着大声地下着命令说：
    “撒！总有一网会打满！”
    我为他们的话怔住了。望着小木船又一摇一摆地把网拉出去的时候，我忽然觉得这些人拉出去的不是鱼网，他们也不是在撒鱼网，他们带出去的是希望，撒出去的也是希望。看来他们不拉回他们的希望，是不会住手的。
    就这样，弄得我这么久了，都不能忘记这些撒网的人。
