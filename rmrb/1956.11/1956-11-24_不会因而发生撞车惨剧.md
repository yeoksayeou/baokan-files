    A Traffic Accident Catastrophe Will Not Occur As A Result
    In the article "Why a National Time Service Network Must Be Established" written by Comrade Li Heng, published on page 7 on October 25, it said: "If there are differences in the times of arriving and departing trains, a traffic accident catastrophe will occur." This statement is not entirely suitable for the situation in our country. At present, the operation of trains in our country basically adopts the distance interval method, and the time interval method is only used in special circumstances. At the same time, communication and signal equipment are installed on our country's railway lines today to ensure traffic safety. The correctness of time is of course very important for railway transportation, but even if trains cannot run according to the prescribed time due to certain reasons, a traffic accident catastrophe will not occur. It is hoped that this will be explained to avoid unnecessary fear among some passengers when taking the train. (Beijing Zhu Yanshou)

    不会因而发生撞车惨剧
    10月25日第七版刊登的李珩同志所写“为什么必须建立国家的授时网”一文中说：“例如来往火车的时刻若有差异，就会演出撞车的惨剧”。这种说法，对于我国的情况不完全适合。目前我国铁路列车的运行，基本上是采用距离间隔法，只有在特殊情况下，才采用时间间隔法。同时，今天我国的铁路线上都安装有通讯和信号设备，来保证行车的安全。时间的正确性对铁路运输来说，当然是相当重要的，但由于某些原因使列车不能按照规定的时间运行，也不会发生撞车惨剧。希望能加以说明，以免有些旅客在乘火车时产生不必要的恐惧心理。　（北京  朱延寿）弗先同志：
