Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 22nd. Two "Liberation" brand vehicles arrived at a motor vehicle unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front on the 21st.

At ten o'clock in the morning, a car with the words "Liberation" inlaid on the front slowly drove into the parking lot of a certain motor vehicle unit. At this time, the officers and soldiers who had long been eager to see the "Liberation" brand vehicles temporarily put down their work and ran to watch. As soon as the car stopped, some people opened the hood, some entered the cab, and some climbed under the car to carefully observe the various machine parts. Everyone praised the car's agility, sturdiness, and beauty in unison.

According to the drivers of these two vehicles, the "Liberation" brand vehicles maintained a normal engine temperature when winding and driving on mountains more than 1,200 meters above sea level without needing to stop to add water. This type of vehicle is very suitable for transportation on roads in mountainous areas.

    解放军用“解放”牌汽车
    新华社福建前线22日电　有两辆“解放”牌汽车21日到达福建前线中国人民解放军某汽车部队。
    上午十点钟，一辆车头上镶着“解放”两字的汽车，缓缓地驶进某汽车部队的停车场。这时，对“解放”牌汽车渴望已久的官兵们，都暂时放下工作跑来观看。汽车一停，有的人打开引擎盖，有的人进入驾驶室，有的人爬到汽车底下，仔细观看各种机器部件，大家异口同声地称赞汽车的灵巧、坚固美观。
    据驾驶这两辆汽车的汽车部队驾驶员说，“解放”牌汽车在拔海一千二百公尺以上的大山上盘旋行驶的时候，机件的热度一直正常，没有停车加水，这种汽车非常适宜在多山地区的公路上运输。
