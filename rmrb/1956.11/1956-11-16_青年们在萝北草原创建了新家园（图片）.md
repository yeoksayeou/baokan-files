Young People Create New Homes on the Luobei Prairie

    A year ago, the Luobei Prairie in Heilongjiang Province was a desolate wilderness. Now, nearly three thousand young people from Beijing, Tianjin, Harbin, Shandong, and other places have transformed it into a beautiful pastoral area. On the newly reclaimed 3,300 hectares of land, grain, soybeans, and other crops have yielded a bumper harvest. Soybeans, accounting for 80% of the planted area, have grown with dense pods and full grains, yielding an average of 2,500 jin per hectare. Various livestock are also breeding. New houses, sports fields, and other facilities are gradually being built. The promising life further strengthens the determination of young people to settle down and build a career in this wilderness. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Wenli photographed.

    A year ago, it was still grassland; now, a new house has been built. This is a corner of the dormitory for members of the Jiaonan Collective Farm in Luobei County.

    The Jiaonan Collective Farm is building a large canteen that can accommodate nearly 500 members.

    The potatoes planted by the Tianjin Youth Collective Farm on the newly reclaimed wasteland have yielded a bumper harvest. The members are transporting the potatoes to the cellar.

    Recently, the Harbin Youth Collective Farm bought nine Harbin White pigs from Harbin, planning to increase the number to 300 next year. A farm worker is brushing the pigs' bodies.

    The radishes planted by the Tianjin Youth Collective Farm have also yielded a bumper harvest. Farm member Ma Yulan (right) is holding a radish that weighs six and a half jin.

    The Harbin Youth Collective Farm originally had 74 oxen and plans to add about 30 dairy cows before the end of the year. These are the newly transported Henan dairy cows.

    青年们在萝北草原创建了新家园
    一年前还是一片荒凉的黑龙江省萝北草原，现在已被来自北京、天津、哈尔滨、山东等地的近三千名青年建设成美丽的田园。新开垦的三千三百公顷土地上，种植的粮食、大豆等作物已获丰收；占种植面积80％的大豆，长得荚密粒大，平均每公顷可收二千五百斤。各种牲畜正在繁殖着。新房屋、运动场等也在逐步建立。美好的生活，更坚定了青年们在荒地上成家立业的决心。　新华社记者　张文礼摄
    一年前还是一片草地，现在已建起一栋新房。这是萝北县胶南集体农庄庄员宿舍的一角。
    胶南集体农庄正在建筑一座可容纳近五百名庄员的大食堂。
    天津青年集体农庄在新开垦的荒地上种的土豆获得丰收。庄员们正将土豆运到窖里去。
    最近哈尔滨青年集体农庄从哈尔滨买来九口哈白猪，计划明年发展到三百口。农庄饲养员正在给猪刷洗身上。
    天津青年集体农庄种的萝卜也获得丰收。庄员马玉兰（右）手中拿的萝卜一个就有六斤半重。
    哈尔滨青年集体农庄原有七十四头耕牛，准备在年内再增加奶牛三十头左右。这是新运到的河南奶牛。
