The sound of a train whistle, "woo woo," awakened Yan Shengfu from his unconsciousness. He was a member of the Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Xinbao'an Town, Huailai County. He opened his eyes and looked up at the car roof and the windows on both sides, feeling very strange: "How did I get on the train? Where's the donkey?"

"Uncle, Uncle, see who I am?" a young man asked softly.

Yan Shengfu looked and saw it was Fan Baochun, a member of the cooperative, and quickly asked, "Baochun, where's our cooperative's donkey?"

"Perfectly fine, not a single hair touched."

"Oh! That's good, good..." He slowly closed his eyes.

"Uncle, do you feel better?" Fan Baochun asked worriedly.

"I, what's wrong with me?" he asked, opening his eyes, his mind unclear.

"You're injured."

"I'm injured?" He tried to lift his arm, but it felt like it weighed a thousand pounds. His body moved slightly, and it hurt to the bone. Half of his face was tightly wrapped in gauze, burning like needles. The pain reminded him of what had happened:

That afternoon, he was driving five donkeys to the north of the city to deliver manure, and had to pass through the railway. These donkeys had only recently joined the cooperative and were not very well integrated. Two of them were walking very fast and ran ahead, while three of them were walking very slowly and lagging behind by dozens of steps.

The two donkeys in front approached the railway, and suddenly, a locomotive appeared around the bend, rushing from east to west with a "woo woo" roar. He immediately shouted "Whoa, whoa" and rushed up to block the donkeys, he couldn't let the cooperative's donkeys get hit! However, the donkeys were frightened by the whistle. Not only did he fail to stop them, but the donkeys ran west along the railway. The train was getting closer and closer, and it looked like the donkeys were in danger. He lunged at the donkeys like a madman…

The donkeys were saved, but he fell down in the "rumbling" sound of the train…

Now, hearing Fan Baochun say that the cooperative's donkeys were fine, not even a hair touched, he was relieved, and a smile appeared on his pale face. At this moment, hundreds of livestock in the cooperative seemed to appear before his eyes, large mules, large horses, and small donkeys, all jumping and kicking, plump and round, which one did he not love! This forty-one-year-old poor peasant had longed to have a head of livestock since he was a child, but for decades he had never even dreamed of a single strand of livestock hair. Only after joining the agricultural cooperative did he have so many livestock. Although they were not his alone, he always felt that they were his. He said, "The cooperative is my home. Which thing in the cooperative has nothing to do with me? Which property doesn't have my share!"

The train was moving forward. When he woke up, he was lying in a bed in the railway hospital. Fan Baochun told him that the doctor had just performed an operation on him, saying it was an external injury and not serious, and told him to rest in peace.

"Rest in peace?" He shook his head, "No, Baochun, let's go back to the cooperative." As he spoke, he sat up with a "whoosh," wanting to get out of bed. Fan Baochun quickly helped him, saying, "No, no! The doctor said you have to rest for a few days before you can leave."

"No, the cooperative is short of manpower these days, we can't stay here." Baochun saw that he couldn't be persuaded, so he called the doctor. After carefully considering his injury, the doctor said that he could go home to recuperate:

"Well, then, you have to take some medicine and be discharged tomorrow."

"No, doctor, my injury is not serious, we will go back tonight. I can't leave the cooperative for a moment..."

They returned home. However, cooperative cadres and members came to visit one after another, and complained that Fan Baochun should not have let him come back. Yan Shengfu felt warm in his heart and tightly held the cooperative director's hand, saying, "Don't worry, everyone! It's okay, I'll be able to work in the fields in a few days."

A few days later, Yan Shengfu appeared in the production team, his face still wrapped in medicated cloth…

    社里的驴
    刘争笑
    一阵“呜呜”的火车汽笛声，使阎生福从昏迷中苏醒过来。他是怀来县新保安镇新华农业社的社员。他睁开眼看看，上面是车顶，两边是车窗，觉得挺奇怪：“怎么跑到火车上来了，驴呢？”
    “大伯，大伯，你看我是谁？”一个年青人轻轻地问。
    阎生福一看，是社员范葆春，忙问：“葆春，咱社的驴呢？”
    “好好的连根毛都没碰着。”
    “哦！那好，好……”他慢慢地阖住了眼。
    “大伯，你觉得好点了吗？”范葆春不放心地问。
    “我，我怎么啦？”他睁开眼，神智不清地问。
    “你受伤了。”
    “我受伤了？”他想抬抬胳膊，可是像有千斤重，身子动了一下，便澈骨似的疼。半个脸紧紧包着纱布，火辣辣的像针扎。疼痛使他记起了发生过的事：
    这天下午，他赶着五头驴往城北送粪，中途要经过铁道。这几头驴刚入社不久，还不怎么合群，有两头走得很快，跑到前面去了，有三头走得很慢，拉后了几十步。
    前面的两头驴挨近铁道了，突然，转弯处出现了火车头，“呜呜 ”吼叫着由东向西急驰而来。他立刻“吁，吁”地大喊着冲上去挡驴，他不能让社里的驴碰着啊！可是，驴被汽笛声吓惊了，他不但没挡住，驴反而顺着铁道边向西跑起来。列车越来越近，眼看驴要有危险了。他像疯了一样向驴扑去……
    驴被救了，他却在火车的“轰隆”声中倒了下去……。
    现在，听范葆春说社里的驴好好的，连根毛都没碰着，他放心了，惨白的脸上露出了笑容。这时，在他眼前仿佛又出现了社里那几百头牲口，大骡子、大马、小毛驴，一个个欢蹦乱跳，滚瓜溜圆，那一个他不喜爱啊！他这个四十一岁的贫农，从小就渴望自己能有一头牲口，可是过去想了几十年，连根牲口毛都没想望上。入了农业社，才有了这么多牲口，虽说这不是他一个人的，但他总觉着是他的，他说：“社就是我的家，社里的事哪一件跟我没关系，哪一宗财产没有我的份！”
    列车在前进。等他醒来，已躺在铁路医院的病床上。范葆春告诉他，医生刚给他动了手术，说是外伤，不要紧，让他安心静养。
      “安心静养？”他摇了摇头，“不行，葆春，咱回社去吧。”说着他就“唿”一下子坐起来，要下床。范葆春急忙扶住他，连说：“不行，不行呀！医生说你得养几天才能走哩。”
    “不，这几天社里正缺人手，咱不能呆在这儿。”葆春看看劝阻不住，只好喊医生。医生仔细考虑他的伤势还可以回家休养后说：
    “那这样吧，你得带些药，明天出院。”
    “不，医生，我的伤不要紧，我们今天夜里就回去。我一会也离不开社……”
    他们回到了家里。可是社干部、社员们一个跟一个跑来看望，还埋怨范葆春不该放他回来。阎生福心里热乎乎的，紧紧握着社主任的手说：“大伙放心吧！不要紧，过两天我就能下地了。”
    几天后，阎生福出现在生产队里，他脸上还裹着药布……。
