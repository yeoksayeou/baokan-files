Reaction to Criticism

    Overcoming the Phenomenon of Dispersed Party Organizations
    The CCP Xinhua County Committee of Hunan Province wrote: After your newspaper published the letter of criticism "Party Organizations Should be Adjusted After the Withdrawal of Districts and Merging of Townships" on August 24, the county committee held a meeting specifically for this purpose and conducted research. It was decided to divide all former district-level organs and units in the county into ten areas, establish a general party branch committee for each area, and establish party branches under it according to the system or unit, with groups under the branch. The general branch committee is directly under the leadership of the county committee and is responsible for the overall management of party work. This has basically overcome the phenomenon of dispersed party organizations that existed before.

    正在克服党组织涣散的现象
    中共湖南新化县委会来信：8月24日你报发表了“撤区并乡后要调整党组织”的批评信后，县委特为此召开了会议，进行了研究。决定把全县原区级机关单位划成十个片，以片为单位成立党的总支委员会，下按系统或单位成立党的分支部，分支部下设小组。总支委员会直属县委领导，负责全盘管理党的工作。这样基本上克服了以前党组织涣散的现象。
