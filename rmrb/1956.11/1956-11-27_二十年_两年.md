    Twenty Years—Two Years
    Chen Zhen
    The Dongya Wool and Linen Textile Factory, famous for producing "Antelope" brand yarn, has been a joint public-private enterprise for two years. Recently, many guests from capitalist countries visited the factory and were very interested in the work and life of Yang Tianshou, the representative of the private shareholders.

    Yang Tianshou worked as a manager in capitalist enterprises for twenty years and has now served as the manager of the joint public-private enterprise for two years.

    Not long ago, a foreign guest asked him: "As a manager, what is the difference between the first twenty years and the last two years?"

    Yang Tianshou replied: "The first twenty years, the days passed slowly, and the hair turned white quickly. The last two years, the days passed quickly, and the hair turned white slowly."

    In the first twenty years, not to mention the humiliating days when the Japanese invaders occupied Tianjin, even during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, politics were so corrupt, finances were so unstable, and inflation devalued the currency every day. The market was a place where the big fish ate the small fish, and the risks were incredibly high. Yang Tianshou recalled his life as a manager at that time, saying: During the day, he guarded the telephone, on tenterhooks, and at night, he lay in bed, haunted by nightmares. One "deal" could make you rich, and another "deal" could leave you penniless. That kind of life was truly a living hell.

    As for now, Yang Tianshou said: "Not only do I not have to live in fear, but my life has a new atmosphere that I have never experienced before." He introduced his work in the new enterprise.

    The Manager's Life in a Joint Venture
    On November 1, 1954, the state formally appointed Yang Tianshou as the manager of the Dongya Wool and Linen Textile Factory, a joint public-private enterprise. From that day on, he ended his managerial work solely serving capitalists and began to exercise the authority of an enterprise manager granted to him by the state. After the new work began, Yang Tianshou was very excited, but there were also many difficulties. For example, in the beginning, department cadres always looked for the public shareholder representative when something happened, and Yang Tianshou couldn't get a word in, which made him feel awkward, thinking that he was "dispensable" in the factory. Later, the party branch and administrative leaders discovered this problem, examined the shortcomings in their work, educated the employees, and repeatedly sought Yang Tianshou's opinions to help him exercise his managerial authority. This year, the state also appointed Yang Tianshou as the deputy manager of the Tianjin Wool, Linen, and Silk Textile Company. Whenever he came to the factory after a day or two, the public shareholder representative and department heads would tell him about the work in the factory during those days, and major issues had to be discussed with him. These things gradually dispelled Yang Tianshou's doubts. He said: I am deeply honored to be so valued by the state. At the same time, I often spur myself to study hard and do a good job. Yang Tianshou reviewed the work he has done in the past two years, and it has increased and become more solid than in the past. For example, he has been paying close attention to the enterprise's management, as well as the work of the private shareholders. In particular, recently, he has put some effort into cost, finance, and product promotion, and he has been going to the workshops more often.

    Remolding Oneself in Cooperation
    Speaking of whether it is easy for capitalists and public shareholder representatives to get along in a joint venture, Yang Tianshou said: This is a new relationship. At first, I was indeed worried, fearing that the East Wind would prevail over the West Wind, or that the West Wind would resist the East Wind. Because of this, I felt a little restrained when approaching the public representatives. But after getting along day and night in work, study, and life, I deeply feel that the public representatives are both good teachers and helpful friends.

    He cited some examples to illustrate his understanding. The overhead shaft in the Dongya Wool Spinning Workshop was unsafe. In the past, the trade union had made several suggestions, hoping to replace it with a "single-row motor." Yang Tianshou had also considered it several times, but never replaced it. After the enterprise became a joint public-private venture, the public representative discussed installing a new overhead shaft with Yang Tianshou and earnestly said: "Workers will not feel at ease and work steadily in an unsafe factory building." And he explained the socialist management principles to him. In this way, Yang Tianshou not only happily agreed to replace the single-row motor, but also examined his own thoughts of neglecting worker safety.

    Yang Tianshou mentioned some ideological education that the party and administration had given him, and said with emotion: "The relationship between capitalists is deceitful. Such deep concern and sincere help as now are nowhere to be found." Now, whenever the public representative gives a report to the employees, Yang Tianshou is willing to listen to it from the side, striving to gain more knowledge. The public representative also often asks Yang Tianshou for advice on production and management issues. When the two of them have nothing to do, they sit together and chat and laugh, without any estrangement.

    Looking Back and Talking About the Future
    The guests also curiously asked: "Are capitalists heartbroken and regretful about giving up the private property of the enterprise?" Yang Tianshou said: "To answer this question, we have to start with the vicissitudes of Dongya's creation."

    That was after the "September 18th" Incident, when the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people across the country was high. They, a group of capitalists, founded "Dongya" - the first wool yarn factory in China. When the first batch of domestically produced "Antelope" brand yarn appeared on the market, it fiercely "resisted" the Japanese "Sparrow" brand and the Western "Bee" brand yarn. At that time, the capitalists also came up with a "Ten Companies" development plan for Dongya, and added a sack factory. But this dream quickly shattered. When the Japanese invaders occupied Tianjin, the "Antelope" brand yarn was forced to stop production. ... It was not until 1952 that the rusted yarn machines were restarted with the support of the People's Government.

    After the Dongya Wool and Linen Textile Factory became a joint public-private venture, both yarn and sacks quickly reached the highest indicators of the enterprise's peak period under private ownership. At this time, the state assigned Dongya a large number of processing tasks for sacks and yarn. Everyone was very happy, but also very anxious, feeling that this was an "unsolvable problem." In the previous twenty years, in order to improve labor productivity, the Dongya capitalists not only bought new machines from abroad, but also sent people to European and American capitalist countries to learn various capitalist enterprise management methods. However, the highest daily output of sacks had never exceeded 4,000. This time, just as they were feeling difficult, the workers put forward many suggestions for improving technology and increasing production. Soon, a new record of 15,000 to 16,000 sacks per day appeared.

    Yang Tianshou said: "As a capitalist, I was somewhat heartbroken and regretful that my shares would become waste paper. However, today, I can see the rapid progress of the enterprise, and see my dream of developing industry in my prime come true. I myself can personally participate in such a historically significant socialist construction work, and gradually transform myself into a truly worthy worker. At the same time, my life is also guaranteed. My children all have jobs now. Some of them are members of the Communist Youth League, and some have joined the Communist Party. In the face of the country's brilliant achievements in construction and the bright future for individuals, giving up exploitation and taking the socialist road is no longer painful or reluctant."

    二十年—两年
    陈珍
    以生产抵羊牌毛线著名的东亚毛麻纺织厂，公私合营两周年了。最近许多来自资本主义国家的客人到厂里参观访问，他们对私股代表杨天受的工作和生活都很感兴趣。
    杨天受过去在资本主义企业里当过二十年经理，现在担任公私合营企业经理的职务也两年了。
    不久以前，一位外国客人问他：“同样当经理，前二十年和后两年又有什么不同？”
    杨天受回答说：“前二十年是日子过得慢，头发白得快，后两年是日子过得快，头发白得慢”。
    前二十年，且不说日寇侵占天津的那一段屈辱的日子，就是在国民党反动统治时期，政治上是那样腐败，财政上又是那样不稳定，而且通货膨胀，币值一日数贬，市场上大鱼吃小鱼，风险大得惊人。杨天受回忆当时经理的生涯说：白天守候着电话机，提心吊胆，晚上躺在床上，恶梦纠缠不清，一个“盘子”可以叫你发财致富，一个“盘子”可以叫你赔得没有裤子穿。那样的生活，真是度日如年。
    至于现在，杨天受说：“我不仅不用提心吊胆地生活，而且生活有了从所未有的新气息。“他介绍了自己在新企业里工作的情况。
    合营企业的经理生活
    1954年11月1日，国家正式任命杨天受担任公私合营东亚毛麻纺织厂的经理。从那天起始，他就结束了单纯为资本家服务的经理工作，开始执行国家给予他的企业管理人员的职权。新的工作开始以后，杨天受很兴奋，但困难也不少。比如，最初一个时期，科室干部有事总找公股代表，杨天受在一旁插不进手，心里就别扭地想到：自己在厂里是“有他不多、无他不少”。后来，党总支和行政领导方面发现了这个问题，对工作中的缺点做了检查，向职工进行了教育，并且几次找杨天受征求意见，帮助他执行经理的职权。今年，国家又任命杨天受兼任了天津市毛麻丝纺织公司的副经理，每当他间隔了一两天到厂里来的时候，公股代表、科室负责干部都要把一两天来厂里的工作情况告诉他，重大的事情，还一定要和他商量。这些事情使杨天受的疑虑逐渐打消了。他说：我能够受到国家的如此器重，是深以为光荣的。同时也就经常鞭策自己努力学习，搞好工作。杨天受回顾这两年来自己做的工作，比过去是增多了、也踏实了。像对于企业的经营管理工作，私股股东方面的工作，他抓得很紧，特别是最近，他对成本、财务、产品的宣传工作等，也下了些工夫，下车间的次数也多了。
    在共事中改造自己
    谈到在合营企业里资本家和公股代表好不好相处的问题，杨天受说：这是一个新的关系，最初，的确担心，怕东风压了西风，也怕西风顶了东风，因为这样，和公方代表接近的时候就感到拘束一些。但是经过在工作中、学习中、生活中朝夕相处，自己深深觉得公股代表是良师，也是益友。
    他举出一些事例说明自己的体会。东亚毛纺车间的天轴不安全，过去工会提过好几次意见，希望换“单行马达”，杨天受也盘算过好几次，总没有换。企业公私合营以后，公股代表找杨天受商量安装新天轴，并且恳切地说：“工人在不安全的厂房里搞生产，一定是不安心，不踏实的。”并且向他解释了社会主义的经营管理原则。这样，就使得杨天受不仅愉快地同意了更换单行马达的意见，而且检查了自己忽视工人安全的思想。
    杨天受提到一些党和行政上对他进行思想教育的事情，感慨地说：“资本家的相互关系是尔虞我诈，像现在这样深切的关怀，真诚的帮助，是找也找不到的。”现在每当公股代表给职工做报告，杨天受都愿意在一旁听听，争取得到更多的教益，而公股代表也常请教杨天受一些生产、经营上的问题。两人没事的时候，还坐在一起谈天说笑，毫无介蒂了。
    抚今追昔话前途
    客人们又好奇地问到：“资本家对放弃企业的私有财产，是不是痛心、惋惜？”杨天受说：“要回答这个问题，得从东亚创建的那一段沧桑史谈起。”
    那是在“九一八”事变之后，全国人民抗日情绪高涨，他们这一批资本家创办了“东亚”——中国第一个毛线工厂。当第一批国产“抵羊牌”毛线出现在市场上的时候，把东洋的“麻雀牌”、西洋的“蜜蜂牌”毛线，曾狠狠地“抵”了一下。当时资本家还搞了个东亚“十大公司”的发展计划，增办了一个麻袋工厂。可是这个梦很快就破灭了。日寇占领天津，“抵羊牌”毛线被迫停了产。……一直到1952年，经过人民政府多方扶持，才把长满了锈的毛线机重新开动起来。
    东亚毛麻纺织厂公私合营以后，毛线、麻袋都很快地达到了企业私营中全盛时期的最高指标。这时候，国家交给“东亚”生产一大批麻袋和毛线的加工任务。大家都很高兴，可是也很着急，感到这是一个没法解决的“难题”。前二十年当中，东亚的资本家为了提高劳动生产率，除了从国外买新型机器之外，还派人到欧美资本主义国家学习了各种资本主义企业管理办法，但是麻袋的最高日产量，一直没超过四千条。而这次，正在他们感到为难的时候，工人们提出了许多改进技术、提高生产的建议，不久，麻袋就出现了日产一万五、六千条的新纪录。
    杨天受说：“我作为一个资本家，对自己的股票将要变为废纸，曾经有些痛心和惋惜。可是，在今天，我能够看到企业一日千里的进步，看到自己壮年时发展工业的梦想变成现实；我自己又能亲自参与这样一项有历史意义的社会主义建设工作，逐步改造自己成为名副其实的劳动者。同时，我的生活也有了保障。我的孩子们现在都有了工作，他们中间有的是青年团员，有的参加了共产党。在国家建设辉煌成就和个人光明前途的面前，自己放弃剥削，走社会主义的路，已经没有什么痛苦和勉强了。”
