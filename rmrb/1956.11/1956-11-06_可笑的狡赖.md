    Ridiculous Quibble
    Recently, British and French aircraft bombed and sank an Egyptian warship in the Suez Canal, cutting off traffic through the canal. However, these sinful bombs also destroyed the biggest shield used by Britain and France to conceal their aggression against Egypt, namely the claim of "maintaining the freedom and safety of navigation in the canal." Because of this, the guilty British government spokesman fell into a very flustered predicament. On the one hand, he had to admit that British and French aircraft did "damage" an Egyptian warship in the canal; on the other hand, he quibbled that the warship "was later scuttled by the Egyptians across the canal." But this guy, who was so addled with lies, forgot that he was in Britain, not by the Suez Canal. How did he know that the warship was "scuttled" by the Egyptians? Did the Egyptian government send him a telegram to inform him?
    Experience has proven that in the court of justice, criminals always babble incoherently. But their incoherent babbling cannot wash away their guilt, but only make their crimes more obvious because of the many loopholes, and arouse the anger and hatred of all upright people.

    可笑的狡赖
    英法飞机最近在苏伊士运河上炸沉了一艘埃及军舰，因而切断了运河的交通。但是，这些罪恶的炸弹，同时也炸毁了英法两国用来掩饰它们侵略埃及的最大的一道挡箭牌，即所谓“维护运河航行的自由和安全”的说法。为了这件事，畏罪的英国政府发言人陷入了十分慌张的窘境。一方面，他不得不承认英法飞机确实在运河上“炸伤”了一艘埃及军舰；另一方面，他又狡赖说，这艘军舰“是后来埃及人横在运河河身凿沉的”。但是，这个撒谎撒昏了头脑的家伙忘记了，他是呆在英国而不是呆在苏伊士运河边，他怎么知道这艘军舰是埃及人“凿沉”的呢？难道是埃及政府打电报通知他的么？
    经验证明，在正义的法庭前，罪犯们总是要牛头不对马嘴地胡说八道的。但他们的这种胡说八道不但不能洗清他们的罪责，而只会是使他们因为破绽百出而更加罪迹昭彰，更引起一切正直的人们的愤怒和憎恨。
