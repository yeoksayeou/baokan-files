Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 5th: Crew members participating in the Yangtze River transport of tug and barge fleets are actively promoting the Soviet Union's advanced push towing method. Currently, the vast majority of fleets traveling upstream, whether in the windy and wavy lower reaches or the rapid currents of the Sichuan River, use the push towing method. The use of push towing for downstream fleets is also above 20% to 30%.

The widespread implementation of push towing has greatly improved the working capacity of Yangtze River tugboats. Compared with 1952, before the promotion of push towing, and January to September of this year, the amount of cargo towed per horsepower by Yangtze River tugboats has more than doubled while maintaining the original speed. At the same time, repeated measurements have proved that after tugboats adopt the push towing method, their coal consumption is also reduced by about 4%.

The push towing method was introduced to Yangtze River sailors by Soviet expert Romanov in 1953. In May of this year, Soviet sailor Belmiyakov from the Volga River also demonstrated the most advanced formation of push towing - single-file push towing - to Yangtze River sailors. These advanced experiences were warmly welcomed by Yangtze River sailors. Although the Yangtze River channel and water flow are different from those in the Soviet Union, the ship types are different, and the equipment on board is also simple, the crew members encountered many difficulties when they started to promote it, but they were not intimidated by these difficulties. When the fleets assembled with new methods had to pass through dangerous channels, the drivers on board would hold "Zhuge Liang meetings" in advance to study countermeasures, and then all of them would go to the bow, sides, and stern of the ship to cooperate in maneuvering. The new style of fleet made it impossible for the drivers to see the front from the original tugboat's driving platform, so they ran to the barge at the front of the fleet to direct, regardless of wind, rain, or scorching sun. Now Yangtze River sailors have explored a complete set of experiences in using push towing on the Yangtze River channel, and even the most difficult to maneuver single-file push towing has been successfully tested in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 5th: Large cargo ships sailing in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are currently promoting the Soviet Union's advanced experience of the shuttle-shaped push towing method.

The first large cargo ship to implement the push towing method, the "People No. 9," used this method to travel upstream against the current, carrying one more 1,000-ton barge than with the original strapping method. The total deadweight of the fleet increased by about 20% compared to the past, the sailing speed increased by 10%, and fuel consumption also decreased.

It is expected that after the widespread promotion of this advanced method among large cargo ships, the materials transported from Shanghai to Hankou can be increased by more than 10,000 tons per month.

### 推行苏联先进的顶推运输法  长江拖轮运货能力提高一倍

    推行苏联先进的顶推运输法
    长江拖轮运货能力提高一倍
    新华社武汉5日电　参加长江运输的拖驳船队的船员们积极推行苏联先进的顶推运输法。现在，逆水上航的船队，无论是在风大浪高的下游或滩多流急的川江，绝大多数都采用顶推法行进。下行船队采用顶推法的也在20％到30％以上。
    顶推运输法的广泛推行，大大提高了长江拖轮的工作能力。以今年1月到9月份和没有推广顶推法前的1952年相比，在维持原有航速的情况下，长江拖轮每匹马力拖运的货物量增加了一倍以上。同时，经过反复测定证明，拖轮采用顶推法航行以后，它的煤耗量也降低了4％左右。
    顶推运输法是在1953年由苏联专家罗曼诺夫介绍给长江海员的。今年5月来自伏尔加河的苏联船员别尔米雅可夫又为长江海员表演了顶推法中最先进的队形——一列式顶推。这些先进经验受到长江海员的热烈欢迎。虽然长江航道、水流与苏联的不同，船型不一样，船上设备也简陋，船员们在开始推广时碰到过很多困难，但是他们并没有被这些困难吓倒。采取新方法编组的船队要过危险航道了，船上的驾驶人员就事先开“诸葛亮会”研究对策，然后，全体出动到船头、船旁、船尾去协力操纵。新式样的船队使驾驶人员站在原来拖轮的驾驶台上看不到前方了，他们就不避风雨烈日跑到船队最前面的驳子上去指挥。现在长江海员已经摸索出了一整套在长江航道上使用顶推运输法的经验，连最不好操纵的一列式顶推法也在长江中、下游试验成功。
    新华社武汉5日电　航行在长江下游的大型货轮，最近正在推行梭形顶推法的苏联先进经验。
    第一艘实行顶推法的大型货轮“人民九号”，采用这种方法逆水上航，比采用原来的绑带法多带了一只载重一千吨的驳船。船队的总载重量比过去提高了20％左右，航行速度加快了10％，燃料耗用量也有减少。
    预计，这种先进方法在大型货轮中普遍推广以后，从上海运向汉口的物资每月可以增加一万吨以上。
