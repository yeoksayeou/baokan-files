    After Preliminary Rectification of Grain Supply Work
    Grain Sales in Hunan Rationally Decreased
    Shanxi's Small and Medium Cities Inspect and Adjust Grain Supply
    (Our newspaper, Changsha dispatch) Hunan Province has achieved initial success in rectifying urban grain supply work.
    Since the third quarter of this year, the phenomenon of wasting grain has generally grown in various parts of Hunan Province, and grain sales in many cities and towns have gradually increased. Many collective catering units do not collect grain coupons for entertaining guests and holding meetings; the food management system of some organizations and groups is unsound, and some employees' family members and outside population do not have grain coupons and grain supply certificates. At the Changsha Geological School, from July to September this year, there were 758 people without grain supply certificates. At the Qingcaoqiao construction site in Hengyang, there were 1,267 people without grain supply certificates from July to September this year. Due to the relatively loose supply of grain for business use, sales increased by about 30% compared with the same period last year.
    Hunan Province convened a conference on urban grain supply work in mid-October. Subsequently, it rectified grain supply and carried out grain saving work in major cities throughout the province, and has now achieved initial results. According to statistics from nine cities and thirty-eight counties in Hunan Province, as of mid-November, 5.02 million catties of grain have been saved, and 780,000 catties of grain have been surplus. Shaoyang City has achieved an average saving of 1.1 liang of grain per person per month. Grain sales in cities such as Hengyang and Changde have gradually decreased. Many people have voluntarily returned surplus grain coupons. (Kuang Luan)
    (Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 24th) Shanxi Province's inspection and adjustment of grain supply in small and medium-sized cities has generally begun. The grain departments of Taiyuan, Yangquan, and Yuci and other cities have completed key inspections of grain consumption units, and have formulated measures to adjust grain supply based on the problems found in the inspection. In order to enable this work to be carried out in depth, the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee recently convened a symposium of mayors and grain bureau chiefs from five cities including Taiyuan, Datong, and Yangquan. At the meeting, in addition to reporting on the situation and problems of grain supply inspection in various cities, the practice of relaxing grain supply due to the growth of blind optimism was criticized. The meeting required all cities to further strengthen management, stop waste, and ensure reasonable supply.
    Since the third quarter of this year, due to the blind optimism of many cadres on the grain issue, the phenomenon of relaxing the supply of grain has occurred in small and medium-sized cities in Shanxi Province. The grain sales in Taiyuan, Datong, Yangquan, Changzhi and other cities in the third quarter all exceeded the planned targets. Since July, the subsidies for grain for collective catering units such as organs, factories, mines, and schools in various cities have been irrationally subsidized on a per capita basis in some places. Due to the excessively loose grain supply, a lot of waste and losses have been caused.

    经过初步整顿粮食供应工作
    湖南粮食销售量合理地下降
    山西中小城市检查调整粮食供应
    本报长沙电　湖南省各地整顿城镇粮食供应工作，已经取得初步成绩。
    今年第三季度以来，湖南省各地普遍滋长了浪费粮食的现象，许多城镇粮食销售量逐渐上升。很多集体伙食单位招待客人和开会用粮不收粮票；某些机关团体的伙食管理制度不健全，有些职工的家属和外来人口不带粮票和粮食供应证件。长沙市地质学校，从今年7月到9月，没有粮食供应证件的达七百五十八人，衡阳青草桥工地在今年7至9月有一千二百六十七人没有粮食供应证件。各地营业用粮由于供应偏松也比去年同一时间销售粮增加约30％。
    湖南省在10月中旬召开了城镇粮食供应工作会议，接着，在全省大城镇整顿粮食供应和开展节约粮食工作，现已取得初步成绩。据湖南省九个市、三十八个县的统计，到11月中旬为止，已节约粮五百零二万斤，节余粮食七十八万斤。邵阳市已做到每人每月平均节约一斤一两粮食，衡阳、常德等城市的粮食销量，已经逐渐下降。很多群众都自动将节余粮票退回。（邝麓安）
    新华社太原24日电　山西省各中、小城市检查和调整粮食供应已经普遍开始。太原、阳泉和榆次等市的粮食部门已经完成对粮食消费单位所做的重点检查，并且已经根据检查中发现的问题，研究制定了调整粮食供应的措施。为了使这一工作能够深入开展，最近山西省人民委员会召集太原、大同、阳泉等五个市的市长和粮食局长举行座谈会。会上，除汇报了各市检查粮食供应的情况和问题外，还批判了因盲目乐观情绪滋长而放宽粮食供应的做法，要求各市进一步加强管理，制止浪费，以保证合理供应。
    今年第三季度以来，山西省各中、小城市由于不少干部对粮食问题盲目乐观，曾经发生放宽供应等现象。太原、大同、阳泉、长治等市第三季度的粮食销售量都超过计划指标。各市从7月份开始对机关、工厂、矿山、学校等集体伙食单位的粮食补助，有的地方在执行中不合理地按人口平均补助。由于粮食供应量偏宽，引起不少浪费和损失。
