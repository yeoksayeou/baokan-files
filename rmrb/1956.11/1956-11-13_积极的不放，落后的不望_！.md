    "Don't Let Go of the Active, Don't Forget the Backward"!
    Kang Weizhong
    Not long ago, a certain agency in Gansu Province held a symposium for rural activists. At the meeting, many people raised the issue of holding too many concurrent posts. The number of concurrent posts was simply astonishing. Among these people, most held seven or eight positions concurrently, and some held more than a dozen. In the past, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulated that activists should not hold more than three concurrent posts, but in reality, this was exceeded by four or five times.
    Holding too many concurrent posts not only affects the work, study, and health of these activists, but also affects their economic income and family relations. Jin Fengting, an activist from Chang'an Township, Zhangye County, holds twelve positions including cooperative director, Communist Youth League secretary, and militia clerk. With so many positions and meetings, one meeting ends and another begins. Last year, he only earned a little over a hundred work points, which he managed to earn by attending meetings during the day and squeezing in labor at night. This year there are even more meetings, and he has even less time to participate in labor. In March, he only did four work points. His whole family is dissatisfied with this approach. His older brother said, "If you don't participate in labor anymore, I won't be able to support you." Angered, he led a youth shock team from the cooperative to the mountains to carry sheep manure as fertilizer; he thought, this would both do the work and earn work points, so he wouldn't be caught in the middle. Who knew that after he climbed mountains and ridges, got up early and went to bed late to carry sheep manure for thirteen days, the cadres in the township, village, and cooperative all fired at him, saying, "You are a League member, you are not doing work at home (actually referring to attending meetings), but secretly running to the mountains to find peace." This made him both laugh and cry.
    Wang Lanxiang (female), the deputy director of the First Cooperative of Yangfang Township, Minqin County, held twelve positions of all sizes, and the commune members called her "Meeting Busy." In March, she attended three meetings in the county, spending more than twenty days, and only labored at home for seven days; in May, she attended three more meetings, and fell ill in bed when she returned. The day after she recovered, she hurriedly rushed to Lanzhou to attend the provincial Communist Youth League representative meeting. According to Wang Lanxiang, she spent three-quarters of her two hundred days this year tied up in meetings, and only did fifty work days. Her enlightened husband didn't say anything, but her sisters-in-law gossiped behind her back, speaking with barbs. When she came back from the meeting, her sisters-in-law would happily leave some food for her; if they were unhappy, they wouldn't even leave food. At the symposium, many such examples were reflected.
    Rural Party and League organizations should solve the problem of activists holding too many concurrent posts, but some rural Party and League organizations not only do not care about and solve the problem, but instead adopt rigid and crude attitudes. For example, an activist named Zhu Liang in Yanchi County, because he held too many concurrent posts and attended meetings every day, became ill from exhaustion. When he had just recovered, he received four notices to attend meetings in one day. Annoyed, he ran to the Party branch to find the secretary, but before he could open his mouth, the secretary waved his hand and said, "Don't say anything!" He went to the district committee to complain, but unexpectedly received a scolding: "You are a League member, shouldn't you do more work? What are you making a fuss about?"
    Why do activists hold so many concurrent posts? Listen to the analysis of Feng Xiangcheng, an activist from Gaoba Township, Wuwei County! He said: The reason why we hold so many concurrent posts is not because we are amazing, but because our superiors—the Party, the League, the Women's Federation, the Armed Forces, the Credit Union…etc.—each say their work is important. They only see these few people. One unit assigns one position, and ten units assign ten positions. They don't cultivate more activists to take on positions. They grab one activist and don't let go. In a word, they are—"Don't Let Go of the Active, Don't Forget the Backward," they don't trust the masses enough.
    Relevant departments and other units with similar situations, please check the work of cultivating activists based on Feng Xiangcheng's opinion.

    “积极的不放，落后的不望”！
    康伟中
    不久以前，甘肃省某机关召开了一个农村积极分子座谈会，会上，许多人提出了他们兼职过多的问题。兼职之多，简直使人吃惊。这些人中，一般都兼七、八个职务，多的有兼十几个职的。过去中共甘肃省委曾规定积极分子兼职不得超过三个，实际上超过规定四、五倍。
    兼职过多，不单影响这些积极分子的工作、学习和身体健康；还影响他们的经济收入和家庭关系。张掖县长安乡积极分子金凤亭，身兼合作社社长、团委书记、民兵队文书等十二个职务，职多会多，这个会开完了，那个会又开始了，去年只挣了一百多个工分，还是白天开会、晚上挤空劳动挣来的。今年会更多了，更没时间参加劳动了，三月份他只作了四分工。这种作法，全家都不满意。他的哥哥说：“你再不参加劳动，我可养活不起你了。”他气愤之下，就带领着合作社内的一个青年突击队，到山里去背羊粪，作肥料；心想，这既搞了工作，又挣了工分，再不会两头受气了。谁知，当他爬山越岭，起早睡晚地背了十三天羊粪回来，乡里、村里、合作社里的干部一齐向他开火了，说：“你是团员，你不在家里搞工作（实际是指开会），偷偷跑到山上躲清静。”这使他哭笑不得。
    民勤县杨坊乡第一合作社副主任王兰香（女），大大小小兼了十二个职，社员们称她为“开会忙”，三月份在县里开了三次会，花费了二十多天时间，在家劳动了七天；五月份又开了三次会，回来就病倒在床上了。病好第二天，又急急忙忙赶到兰州开省团代表会。照王兰香的说法，她今年度过的二百多天中，缠在会议中的时间占了四分之三，作下的劳动日仅有五十个。她的开明的丈夫倒没有说什么，可是妯娌们却在背后嘀咕，说话带刺。开会回来，妯娌们高兴还给留点饭；不高兴连饭也不留。在座谈会上，反映出的这样的例子很多。
    对积极分子兼职过多的问题，农村中的党团组织是应该加以解决的，可是，有些农村党团组织不仅不过问和解决，相反的，却采取了生硬和粗暴的态度。如盐池县一个叫朱亮的积极分子，由于兼职过多，天天开会，累病了；病刚好，一天连接四个通知开会，他气急了，就跑到党支部去找书记，可是，这位书记没等他开口，就把手一摆说：“不要说了！”他到区委会去诉苦，不料又挨了一顿批评：“你是个团员，多干点工作不应该吗？吵吵嚷嚷干什么。”
    为什么积极分子兼职过多呢？听听武威县高坝乡积极分子冯祥成的分析吧！他说：兼职多，并不是我们了不起，而是我们的上级——党、团、妇联、武装、信用……等单位，各说各的工作重要，他们就看见这几个人，一个单位按一个职位，十个单位就按十个职位，他们不去培养更多的积极分子担任职务。抓住一个积极分子死不放。一句话，他们是——“积极的不放，落后的不望”，对群众太不相信了。
    有关部门以及其他有同样情况的单位，请根据冯祥成的意见，检查一下对积极分子的培养工作吧。
