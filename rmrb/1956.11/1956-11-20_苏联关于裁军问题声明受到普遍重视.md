Xinhua News Agency, November 19th: According to TASS, Cairo, November 18th, the Soviet government's statement on disarmament and easing international tensions has drawn great attention from the Egyptian public. All newspapers published the Soviet government's statement.

    "People's Daily" headline: "Soviet Union Proposes New Proposals on Disarmament" "Bulganin Says War Hysteria Creates Danger of Expanded Conflict, Aggression Against Egypt Threatens New World War." "News" headline: "Bulganin Suggests Destroying Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" "Suggests Convening a Meeting to Study Disarmament Plans." "Republic Daily" headline: "Bulganin Says: Military Adventure Against Egypt Not Only Seriously Weakened the Political Position of Britain and France, but Also Weakened Their Military Strategic Position." This newspaper particularly emphasized the part of the statement about preparing a powerful force to counter aggressors.

Xinhua News Agency, November 19th: Washington News: White House Press Secretary Hagerty said at a press conference on the 18th that the US President would "study in detail" the new proposals on disarmament put forward by the Soviet Union.

    According to a report by United Press Washington reporter Gonzales, Eisenhower's special adviser on disarmament, Stassen, after receiving the Soviet proposal, "immediately convened a meeting of the disarmament committees of both houses of Congress. Representatives of the State Department, the Department of Defense, the Atomic Energy Commission, and the Central Intelligence Agency attended the meeting. They began to make a meticulous assessment of the Soviet proposal." Gonzales said: "After the US studies the (Soviet) statement through Stassen's committee, it intends to make cautious explorations through diplomatic channels and the United Nations to clarify some of the Russians' claims." Gonzales also said: "A US official spokesman said that the Soviet proposal on the use of aerial surveillance methods, even if implemented in a limited area, "would be very important."

    All American radio stations and newspapers broadcast and published abstracts of the Soviet statement on disarmament on the 18th. The "New York Times" and the "New York Herald Tribune" both emphasized the Soviet government's proposal on aerial photography in their headlines. "New York Times" reporter Carroll pointed out that the Soviet government's proposal contained "new components worthy of serious attention."

Xinhua News Agency, November 19th: According to TASS, the Soviet government's statement on disarmament has aroused widespread attention from public opinion in Western European countries, and many newspapers have pointed out the great significance of this statement.

    London newspapers reported on the statement on November 18th in a prominent position. Foreign policy commentator Robins of the "Reynolds News" opposed some of the proposals in the statement in his commentary, but he wrote: "Since the Russian proposals help to ease international tensions, they should be carefully studied. In addition to the Soviet proposals, Western countries should also be prepared to put forward their own proposals."

    This newspaper argued in an editorial that the Soviet proposals did not seem to have much new content, but at the same time pointed out that if war is not desired, it is necessary to live in peace with the Soviet Union, so "every possibility must be used to conduct peace negotiations with the Soviet Union."

    Many other British newspapers, such as "The Observer" and "Sunday Graphic," pointed out that the Soviet Union, in order to cater to the hopes of Western countries on the issue of aerial photography plans, had expressed its willingness to study the implementation of this plan in Europe. The commentary in "World News" also emphasized, "Moscow knows where it is going, does Washington know this?"

    Paris newspapers also published the Soviet government's statement. "Humanité Hebdo" specifically mentioned the part of the Soviet government's statement regarding the convening of a five-nation government summit on disarmament and the Soviet government's agreement to consider the issue of aerial photography.

    According to a report by the Italian news agency ANSA, "The Soviet statement has aroused great interest in Italian diplomatic circles. Generally speaking, the initial impression of political observers can be said to be good." The report said, "Although the Soviet proposal seems acceptable at first glance, Rome believes that a very cautious attitude is needed towards this Soviet proposal." The news agency said, "Italian Foreign Minister Martino will discuss the international part of the Soviet proposal with US government officials in Washington. Martino will then report to Prime Minister Segni, and Segni will convey the contents of the report at the cabinet meeting to be held on November 21."

    When talking about the initial reaction of Bonn political figures to the Soviet government's statement, West Germany's Deutsche Press-Agentur said that Fritz Heine, director of the press department of the German Social Democratic Party, believed that the new Soviet proposal was "a step further in the direction of easing tensions." Heine said that the Soviet proposal on monitoring arms reductions deserves particularly detailed study by political and military experts.

    Austria's "Wiener Zeitung" wrote: "The Soviet proposal includes some noteworthy new elements that in some respects cater to the wishes of Western countries." "Österreichische Volksstimme" said that the realization of the Soviet proposal would not only mean an immediate easing of international tensions, but also mean eliminating the danger of atomic war, starting to abolish military blocs, and withdrawing all foreign troops from the territories of other countries.

    苏联关于裁军问题声明受到普遍重视
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社开罗18日讯：苏联政府关于裁军和缓和国际紧张局势问题的声明引起了埃及公众极大的注意。各报刊载了苏联政府的声明。
    “人民报”的标题是：“苏联在裁军方面提出新建议”“布尔加宁说：战争歇斯底里造成扩大冲突的危险，侵略埃及的行为引起了新的世界大战的威胁”。“消息报”的标题是：“布尔加宁建议销毁原子弹和氢弹”“建议召开研究裁军计划的会议”。“共和国报”的标题是：“布尔加宁说：对埃及的军事冒险不但严重地削弱了英法两国的政治地位，而且削弱了它们的军事战略地位”。这家报纸特别强调指出声明中关于准备反击侵略者的强大力量的部分。
    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂18日在记者招待会上说，美国总统对苏联提出的关于裁军问题的新建议将“详细地加以研究”。
    据合众社华盛顿记者冈萨雷斯报道，艾森豪威尔的裁军问题专门顾问史塔生，在接到苏联建议以后，“立即召开了参众两院裁军问题委员会会议。国务院、国防部、原子能委员会和中央情报局的代表都参加了这次会议。他们着手对苏联的建议作细致的估价”。冈萨雷斯说：“美国在史塔生的委员会研究过（苏联）声明以后，打算通过外交途径和联合国作谨慎的试探，以便弄清楚俄国人的某些主张”。冈萨雷斯还说：美国的一位官方发言人说，苏联提出的关于使用空中监督方法问题的建议，即使是在被限定的地区内实行，“也将是十分重要的”。
    美国所有的广播电台和各日报18日都广播和刊载了苏联关于裁军问题声明的摘要。“纽约时报”和“纽约先驱论坛报”在标题中都强调了苏联政府就空中摄影问题所提出的建议。“纽约时报”记者卡罗尔指出，苏联政府的建议包含着“值得严重注意的新成分”。
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联政府关于裁军问题的声明引起西欧国家舆论的普遍重视，许多报纸都指出了这个声明的重大意义。
    伦敦报纸11月18日用显著地位报道了这个声明。“雷诺新闻”的外交政策评论员罗本斯在评论中反对这个声明提出的一些建议，但是他写道：“既然俄国人的建议有助于缓和国际紧张局势，那就应当仔细地加以研究。除了苏联的建议以外，西方国家也应当准备提出它们自己的建议。”
    这一家报纸在社论中硬说苏联的建议好像没有很多新内容，但是同时又指出，如果不希望战争就得同苏联和平共处，所以必须利用“一切可能来同苏联进行关于和平的谈判”。
    其他许多英国报刊，例如“观察家报”和“星期日画报”都指出苏联为了迎合西方国家在空中摄影计划问题上的希望，已经表示愿意研究在欧洲采取这个计划的问题。“世界新闻报”的评论还强调指出，“莫斯科知道它走向何处去，华盛顿知道这点吗？”
    巴黎各报也刊载了苏联政府的声明。“人道报星期刊”特别提到苏联政府声明中关于就裁军问题召开五国政府首脑会议和苏联政府同意考虑空中摄影问题的部分。
    意大利安莎通讯社的消息说，“苏联的声明引起意大利外交界很大的兴趣。一般说来，政治观察家的初步印象可以说是良好的。”消息说，“虽然苏联的建议初看起来似乎是可以接受的，但是罗马方面认为对苏联的这次建议须要采取非常谨慎的态度。”这家通讯社说，“意大利外交部长马蒂诺将在华盛顿同美国政府人士讨论苏联建议的国际部分。马蒂诺然后将向内阁总理塞尼提出报告，而由塞尼在11月21日召开的内阁会议上传达报告的内容。”
    西德的德意志新闻社在谈到波恩政界人士对苏联政府的声明的初步反映时说，德国社会民主党新闻部主任弗里茨·海涅认为，苏联的新建议是“继续向缓和紧张局势的方向迈进的一个步骤”。海涅说，苏联关于监督裁减军备问题的建议值得政治和军事专家们加以特别详细的研究。
    奥地利“维也纳日报”写道：“苏联的建议包括有在某些方面迎合西方国家愿望的一些值得注意的新成分。”“奥地利人民之声报”说，实现苏联的建议不仅是意味着国际紧张局势的立刻缓和，而且还意味着消除原子战争的危险、开始取消军事集团和一切外国军队撤离别国领土。
