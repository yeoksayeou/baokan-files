Opening Up the Free Market Is Not Abandoning All Control
Guangdong Strengthens Leadership over Farmers' Trade

(Our dispatch) The Guangdong Provincial People's Committee held a financial and trade conference from November 15th to 21st, focusing on studying and resolving some problems that have arisen since the opening of the market.

By the end of October, rural free markets in Guangdong Province had been basically opened. After the opening of the free market, the variety and quantity of goods on the market increased significantly. The activity of the rural market further promoted the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, stimulated the development of agricultural and sideline production, and improved the business enthusiasm of small vendors. It also promoted the improvement of the management and business style of state-owned commercial departments.

However, some new problems have also emerged since the opening of the free market. The main ones are soaring prices for certain agricultural and sideline products that are in short supply; market prices are higher than listed prices; some farmers are unwilling to sell their products to the state, and even overturn the original pre-purchase and order contracts, and return pre-purchase payments. The phenomenon of farmers doing business has become widespread, and the number of unlicensed vendors has increased significantly in various places. This situation has begun to affect agricultural production and the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives, and has also caused operational difficulties for some small vendors. Some agricultural cooperatives blindly develop handicrafts, producing and selling their own products, which has also created operational difficulties for handicraft cooperatives.

The meeting believes that the reason for the above problems is mainly that the relevant departments lack leadership over the already opened free market, and propaganda work lags behind the development of actual work. Many cadres and the masses do not understand the meaning and scope of opening up the free market. In some areas, farmers are even allowed to freely transport and sell state-monopolized peanuts and essential commodities such as jute and live pigs. The responsible cadres of some counties even told the masses: "Sell to whoever offers the higher price."

The meeting believes that it is not surprising that these problems arise at the beginning of the opening of the free market. However, if these problems are allowed to continue, they will cause great harm. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly change the current state of laissez-faire towards the free market, widely publicize policies, draw clear lines, strengthen management where it should be strengthened, and resolutely open up where it should be opened up.

According to the spirit of the central instructions and in combination with the specific conditions of the province, the meeting further proposed measures and methods to improve market work, and clearly defined the scope of farmers' trade.

In order to stabilize prices, the meeting stipulated different management methods for various types of commodities. For commodities subject to state monopoly purchase, the management method of statutory prices is adopted. The highest price for farmers to sell surplus products after completing the state's monopoly purchase tasks cannot exceed the state-prescribed unified sales price. For commodities that the state controls the purchase of, the purchase price adopts two types of sales prices: statutory prices and purchase prices with flexible margins. The purchase-sale price difference should be tightened in the producing areas, and the highest sales price should be stipulated in the sales areas to prevent price gouging. For commodities that are not subject to state monopoly purchase or controlled purchase, the state does not post listed prices, and price management mainly adopts the method of periodic production and sales price negotiation.

The meeting believes that ideological education should be strengthened for farmers to stop farmers from engaging in commercial activities such as reselling. As for the contradictions between agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives, the principle of resolution should be: concurrent operation should give way to exclusive operation, and it should be uniformly arranged by the local party and government organs.

The meeting believes that in order to strengthen market management, market management committees should be established immediately in various counties, cities, and towns. In urban areas and key areas, comprehensive or specialized exchanges should be established under the leadership of the market management committee. According to needs, some of the original guilds, godowns, or wholesale stores can be restored. The management and leadership of small vendors must be strengthened, and unlicensed vendors are not allowed to operate. Small vendors from outside must be certified and registered before being allowed to trade, and must abide by local price management, and speculative and illegal activities are strictly prohibited. State-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives must actively improve business management, rationally organize commodity circulation, and better serve producers and consumers.

### 开放自由市场不是放任自流  广东加强对农民贸易的领导

    开放自由市场不是放任自流
    广东加强对农民贸易的领导
    本报讯　广东省人民委员会于11月15日至21日举行财贸会议，着重研究解决市场开放后所发生的一些问题。
    到10月底止，广东省农村自由市场已经基本开放。自由市场开放后，上市的商品品种、数量显著增加。农村市场的活跃，进一步促进了城乡物资交流，刺激了农副业生产的发展，提高了小商贩的经营积极性，同时也促进了国营商业部门经营管理和经营作风的改善。
    但是，自由市场开放后也出现了一些新问题。这主要是某些供不应求的农副产品价格暴涨；市价高于牌价；部分农民不愿把产品卖给国家，甚至推翻原订的预购、订购合同，退还预购款。农民经商的现象已普遍出现，各地无牌摊贩大量增加。这种情况已开始影响到农业生产和农业社的巩固，并造成某些小商贩经营上的困难。有些农业社盲目发展手工业，自产自销，也给手工业合作社造成经营上的困难。
    会议认为：发生以上问题的原因，主要是有关部门对已经开放的自由市场缺乏领导，宣传工作落后于实际工作的发展，许多干部和群众还不了解开放自由市场的意义和范围。有些地区，竟允许农民自由贩运国家统购的花生和必须掌握的黄麻、生猪等。有的县的负责干部竟向群众说：“谁出的价钱高，就卖给谁。”
    会议认为，在开放自由市场的开始，出现这些问题是不奇怪的。但是，如果让这些问题继续存在下去，就会产生很大危害。因此，必须迅速改变目前对自由市场放任自流的状态，广泛地宣传政策，划清界限，该管的必须加强管理，该放的必须坚决开放。
    会议根据中央指示精神，结合本省具体情况，进一步提出了改进市场工作的措施和办法，明确规定了农民贸易的范围。
    为了稳定物价，会议对各类商品规定了不同的管理办法。对统购的商品，采取法定价格的管理办法。农民出售完成国家统购任务后的剩余产品，最高价不能超过国家规定的统销价。由国家掌握收购的商品，收购价根据不同的商品采取法定价格和有机动幅度的收购价格两种销售价，在产区应紧缩购销差价，在销区规定最高的销售价，以防止暴抬价格。不为国家统购和掌握收购的商品，国家不挂牌价，价格管理主要采取定期产销议价的办法掌握。
    会议认为应该对农民加强思想教育，制止农民进行转手买卖等商业活动。至于农业社和手工业社的矛盾，解决的原则应该是：兼营应该让专营，由当地党政机关加以统一安排。
    会议认为，为了加强市场管理，各县、市、镇应立即设立市场管理委员会。在城镇和重点地区，应在市场管理委员会领导下设综合性的或专业性的交易所。根据需要，可以恢复一部分原来的行、栈或批发商店。小商贩的管理领导必须加强，无牌摊贩不准营业。外来的小商贩必须经过认证登记后，才准许交易，并须服从当地的价格管理，严禁投机违法行为。国营商业和供销社必须积极改善经营管理，合理组织商品流转，更好地为生产者和消费者服务。　（尔祥）
