　　Loving the Cooperative and Running it Democratically

　　Rural workers and leaders of agricultural production cooperatives all hope that cooperative members will love the cooperative as their home, and wholeheartedly care for it and cherish it.

　　Love cannot be forced on anyone. If we want members to love the cooperative, we must make them truly feel that the cooperative is lovable, and that they are the masters of the cooperative. It can be said that the cooperative members' love for the cooperative is directly proportional to the democracy of the cooperative cadres: the more extensive and normal the democracy within the cooperative is, the more solid and high-spirited the cooperative members' love for the cooperative will be. The new atmosphere of harmony, democracy, and unity in production that has emerged in the countryside after the agricultural cooperatives in Shangrao Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, implemented the policy of democratic management of cooperatives proves this point.

　　If one attempts to restrain cooperative members by relying only on a few people to stipulate a few rules and force them to "love" the cooperative, that approach will first scare away the cooperative members' love for the cooperative.

    爱社和民主办社
    农村工作人员和农业生产合作社的领导人员都希望社员群众爱社如家，全心全意地关心它，爱护它。
    爱，是谁也勉强不得谁的。要想使社员们爱社，就必须让社员真正感觉到合作社的可爱，让社员都感觉到自己是合作社的主人。可以说，社员们的爱社思想是跟社干部的民主成正比例的：社内民主发扬得越广泛、越正常，社员们爱社的感情就越牢固、越高昂。江西省上饶专区的农业社贯彻执行了民主办社的方针以后，农村中出现的和睦、民主、团结生产的新气象，就证明了这一点。
    如果企图只靠少数人规定几条戒律把社员箍住，强迫社员“爱”社，那种做法，首先就会把社员爱社的心吓跑的。
