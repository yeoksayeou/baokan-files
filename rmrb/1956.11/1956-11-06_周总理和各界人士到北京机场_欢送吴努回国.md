Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Premier Zhou Enlai and people from all walks of life went to Beijing Airport today to welcome U Nu, President of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, his wife and entourage, to see them off on their return home by plane. Yao Zhongming, Chinese Ambassador to Burma, and U Hla Maung, Burmese Ambassador to China, accompanied President U Nu to Kunming on the same plane.

At 8:35 a.m., President U Nu, accompanied by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, arrived at the airport by car. Those who welcomed the Burmese guests here included Chen Yun, He Long, and Li Fuchun, Vice Premiers of the State Council, Guo Moruo and Peng Zhen, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Zhizhong, Cheng Qian, and Long Yun, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council, Zhang Bojun and Bao Erhan and his wife, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Gao Kelin, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, Zhang Hanfu and his wife, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, heads of departments of Chinese state organs, democratic parties, people's organizations, and the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, people from all walks of life, and diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries to China.

In his farewell speech at the airport, President U Nu said: "When we negotiated with the Chinese leaders, they treated us with a very sincere and very fair and reasonable attitude. The Chinese leaders did not treat us as a big country treats a small country, but treated us with the principles of equality and mutual benefit, fairness and reasonableness in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Therefore, I once again express that this is the point that makes me most moved."

President U Nu also spoke about his impressions of his visit to China. He said, "What particularly moved us was that in every place we went, the leaders of the Chinese government, mass leaders and people from all walks of life, and even Chinese children, did not treat us as ordinary friends, but treated us like relatives." "I visited China in 1954 and stayed in China for quite a long time. But two years later, when I visited China again, we saw many new buildings, new factories and other new constructions that we had not seen before. Therefore, when I see this situation, I think that if I visit China again in a few years, even the face of China may not be recognizable. We believe that such rapid national progress, according to Buddhism, is also an auspicious phenomenon."

In the end, President U Nu wished great China further development, wished Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai and other Chinese leaders further success in promoting the prosperity of great China and the Chinese people, and wished Sino-Burmese friendship forever and world peace forever.

Before boarding the plane, the Burmese guests shook hands with the welcomers again to say goodbye, and accepted flowers from the young actors of the China Children's Theater. President U Nu recognized the actress who played Xiao Lan in the play "Malan Flower", praised their theater's performance, and congratulated them on their future success.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 5th. U Nu, President of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, and his wife, accompanied by Yao Zhongming, our Ambassador to Burma, and U Hla Maung, Burmese Ambassador to our country, and his wife, arrived in Chongqing by plane at 3:30 this afternoon. Those who came with them included U Min Thein, Judge of the High Court of Burma, and his wife, and nine other people.

Those who went to the airport to greet them included Ren Baige, Mayor of Chongqing, Chen Chou, Deputy Mayor, Zhou Qinye, Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations.

    周总理和各界人士到北京机场
    欢送吴努回国
    新华社5日讯　缅甸联邦反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努和夫人及随行人员今天上午乘飞机离北京回国。中国驻缅甸大使姚仲明、缅甸驻华大使吴拉茂同机陪送吴努主席到昆明。
    上午八时三十五分，吴努主席由国务院总理、中共中央副主席周恩来陪同坐汽车来到飞机场。在这里欢送缅甸客人们的有国务院副总理陈云、贺龙、李富春，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若、彭真，国防委员会副主席张治中、程潜、龙云，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席章伯钧、包尔汉和夫人，最高人民法院副院长高克林，外交部副部长章汉夫和夫人，中国国家机关各部门、各民主党派、各人民团体和中缅友好协会的负责人，中国人民解放军的将军们和社会各界人士，以及各国驻华使节和外交官员。
    吴努主席在机场发表的告别讲话中说：“当我们和中国领袖谈判时，他们以一种非常真挚和非常公平合理的态度对待我们。中国领袖们并不是以大国对小国的态度来对待我们，而是以和平共处五项原则中的平等互利公平合理的原则来对待我们。因此，我再一次表示这是我感到使我最感动的一点。”
    吴努主席还谈到这次访问中国的印象。他说，“使得我们特别感动的是，我们所到的每一个地方，中国政府的领袖们，群众领袖和各界人民，甚至中国的儿童们，不是以普通朋友来招待我们，而是像亲戚一样来招待我们。”“我在1954年来访问过中国，并且在中国逗留了相当长的时间。但是在两年后的今天，当我再一次到中国来访问时，我们看见了以前所没有见过的许多新建筑物，许多新工厂和其他的新建设。因此，在我看到这种情况的时候，我想当我如果再过几年，我再来访问中国的时候，甚至中国的面貌也不可能认出来了。我们认为像这样迅速的国家进步，按照佛教来说，也是吉祥的现象。”
    吴努主席最后祝伟大的中国获得进一步的发展，祝毛泽东主席、周恩来总理和其他的中国领袖在为促进伟大中国和中国人民的繁荣事业中得到进一步的成功，祝中缅友好万岁和世界和平万岁。
    缅甸客人们在登上飞机以前，同欢送者再次握手告别，并且接受了中国儿童剧院小演员的献花。吴努主席认出了扮演“马兰花”一剧中的小兰的演员，向她赞扬他们剧院的演出，祝贺他们今后获得成功。
