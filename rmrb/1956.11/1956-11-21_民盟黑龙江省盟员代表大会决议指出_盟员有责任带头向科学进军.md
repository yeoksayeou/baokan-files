Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 19th: The resolution passed at the First Delegates' Conference of the China Democratic League in Heilongjiang Province, held from the 16th to the 18th, pointed out that members of the Democratic League have the responsibility to play an active role in the march towards science.

The conference believes that Heilongjiang Province has great potential in agricultural, forestry, and industrial and mining production, but its scientific and technological strength is very weak. There are many young workers, but the atmosphere for academic research is not strong enough. Most of the League members in the province are distributed in cultural education and science and technology departments. In order to change the unsatisfactory situation in this regard in the past, all League members in the province have the responsibility to take the lead in marching towards science. The League organizations should supervise and check that League members conscientiously implement the advancement plan, understand and study the difficulties, problems, and requirements they encounter in the advancement, reflect them to relevant parties, and try to help solve them, in order to assist the province's cultural and scientific leading organs to strengthen Heilongjiang Province's scientific and technological strength and improve cultural and educational levels as soon as possible.

    民盟黑龙江省盟员代表大会决议指出
    盟员有责任带头向科学进军
    新华社哈尔滨19日电　16日到18日召开的中国民主同盟黑龙江省第一次盟员代表大会上通过的决议中指出，民主同盟盟员有责任在科学进军中起积极作用。
    大会认为，黑龙江省农业、林业、工矿企业生产潜力很大，但是科学技术力量很薄弱，青年工作者较多，但学术研究空气不够浓厚。全省盟员大部分分布在文化教育和科学技术部门，为了改变过去在这方面不能令人满意的状况，全省盟员有责任带头向科学进军，盟组织应督促与检查盟员认真执行进军规划，了解研究他们在进军中的困难、问题和要求，向有关方面反映，并且设法帮助解决，以协助全省文化科学领导机关尽快地加强黑龙江省的科学技术力量和提高文化教育水平。
