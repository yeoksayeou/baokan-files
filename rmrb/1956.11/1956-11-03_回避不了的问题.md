Unavoidable Questions

    Amidst the global tide of anger against the Anglo-French armed invasion of Egypt, press conferences at the British Foreign Office have also become tense. However, many reporters flocked there not to hear the British government's sophistry regarding the Anglo-French aggression, but to question the British government, leaving the British Foreign Office spokesperson in a very embarrassing position. According to the Associated Press, at a "most heated" press conference on October 31, "news reporters raised many questions in particular," and the British Foreign Office spokesperson either "refused to answer or tried to evade" them. However, the reporters continued to press with one question after another, and "insisted on an answer from the spokesperson, who then became angry and abruptly ended the press conference."

    What were the questions that the British Foreign Office spokesperson dared not answer? According to reports, one Egyptian reporter asked him to answer: Is the current British government a "democratic government or a fascist government"? Another Spanish reporter asked him if he thought the actions of Britain and France were a "betrayal" of their own allies. Another Asian reporter said: Britain previously said it was "temporarily" occupying the Suez Canal area, but it stayed there for seventy years; now Britain and France say they will occupy it "temporarily" again, how long do they intend to occupy it?

    These questions cannot be avoided. Because ironclad facts have already provided the answer, and the anger and protests of hundreds of millions of people around the world have already provided the answer. The British spokesperson's "angry" ending of the press conference only shows how unspeakable and shameful the invaders are.

    回避不了的问题
    在全世界反对英法武装侵略埃及的怒潮里，英国外交部的记者招待会也紧张起来了。但是，许多记者涌到那里去，并不是为了听取英国政府发言人对英法侵略行为的诡辩，而是向英国政府提出质问，这使得英国外交部的发言人狼狈不堪。据合众社报道，在10月31日的一次“最热烈的”记者招待会上，“新闻记者们特别提出了许多问题”，英国外交部发言人“不是不予答复，就是设法回避”，但是，记者们一个问题接着一个追问下去，并且“非要发言人回答不可，于是发言人恼怒了，忿然结束了招待会。”
    英国外交部发言人不敢回答的是些什么问题呢？据报道，有一个埃及记者要他回答：英国现在的政府究竟是“民主政府呢还是法西斯政府”？又一个西班牙记者问他，他认为英法的行动是不是“出卖”了它们自己的盟国？又一个亚洲记者说：英国上次说它“临时”占领苏伊士运河区，但它在那里呆了七十年；现在英法又说要“临时”占领，它们想占多久？……
    这些问题是回避不了的。因为铁一样的事实已经作回答，全世界成亿人民的忿恨和抗议已经作了回答。英国发言人“忿然”结束了记者招待会，正说明侵略者是多么开不得口，见不得人。
