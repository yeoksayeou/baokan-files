    He Learned His First Lesson in the Mass Line
    By our reporter Cao Baoming
    After improving the efficiency of machines for removing impurities from cotton, the key remaining problem in the cotton cleaning workshop was how to eliminate the "cotton roll翘尾巴" phenomenon.
      "翘尾巴" ("Qiao Weiba," or "upturned tail"), this is the colloquial term used by the workers of the Wuhan Yuhua Yarn Factory for what is technically called "tail-end overweight of cotton rolls." It means that the final portion of the cotton roll, less than one yard long, is too thick and too heavy, exceeding the national standard, thus "翘" ("qiao," or "upturned"). The final portion of the cotton roll, less than one yard long, often exceeds the prescribed weight by only one or two qian (a unit of weight), making it difficult to control. Workers, even some advanced producers, had failed to meet the four related targets for several months. Cotton rolls with upturned tails caused uneven thickness in the spun cotton yarn, which was a major obstacle to improving the quality of cotton yarn.
    Initially, technician Cao Zitong tried to solve this problem by improving the equipment, but he couldn't figure it out. The factory Party committee instructed the workshop to summarize advanced experiences from the operations of the masses and rely on the masses to solve the problem. In the past, some technicians would only take a look at the workers' operations and then write down a few experiences, but the resulting summaries did not match the actual situation and could not be promoted. This time, in response to this shortcoming, the Party committee required them to conduct in-depth observation and research, consult with the masses—especially those with advanced experience—and truly summarize their experiences.
    Based on this instruction, the workshop conducted a general review of the workers' production records and found that Peng Zhengyi produced the fewest cotton rolls with upturned tails, sometimes none at all.
    This discovery made Cao Zitong very excited and also surprised. This was because Peng Zhengyi's nickname was "Naughty," and he was a notorious layabout. In everyone's impression, he worked casually but was full of odd remarks. In any serious situation, his mantra was always: "We work to get paid, that's it!" Which often annoyed everyone. A few days ago, when his child was sick, the trade union gave him ten yuan in aid, and he said that his family was having financial difficulties and wanted to borrow money from the workers' savings and mutual aid society. The workers thought that his family could barely make ends meet, but it was only because he liked to go to small restaurants and spend seven or eight yuan a month on drinks that he had financial difficulties, so they didn't lend him the money. He got angry at the time and insisted on withdrawing from the mutual aid society, leaving everyone with an even worse impression. Everyone disliked the way he stood crookedly and sat with his shoes off, hugging his knees with his hands, saying that he "didn't stand like he should stand and didn't sit like he should sit." Who would have thought that he would have advanced experience in this crucial issue!
    Cao Zitong immediately went to the machine to observe his operations and saw that his movements were simple and agile, better than the average person, but he couldn't see any obvious characteristics. Cao Zitong also went to talk to him about his operational experience, but he refused to talk to him even after three attempts. The technician, who was only twenty-two years old this year, became anxious and said: "If this problem is not solved, the quality of cotton yarn will be poor, which will cause losses to the country, and we all have a responsibility!" This angered Peng Zhengyi, who said: "What skills does a layabout like me have! If you want to solve the problem, go to the model workers!"
    According to Cao Zitong's thinking, which worker wouldn't want the leadership to summarize and promote their experience? He never thought that Peng Zhengyi, this "eccentric," would give him the cold shoulder! He ran off to report to Qian Fulao, the branch secretary and workshop director, but when he saw that Qian Fulao didn't say anything for a long time, he became even more anxious.
    He simply didn't expect that Qian Fulao would self-criticize and say: "Hmm, this is a criticism of our work! In the past, we only paid attention to workers who were active in their performance, and we didn't take good enough care of workers who performed poorly. It's inevitable that he has opinions about the leadership..." Then, Qian Fulao asked: "How did you talk to him?" "I always said that his experience was good and sincerely wanted him to share his experience." Who knew that Qian Fulao would smile and say: "That's the problem. He was already angry at the leadership, and you went to him just to ask for his experience, so he took his anger out on you." "How can you blame me," he thought with some feeling of being wronged, but he didn't say it out loud. Qian Fulao seemed to see through his thoughts and added:
    "Comrade Cao Zitong, it's not easy to do mass work! To rely on the masses, you must first care about the masses, care about their work, care about their lives, and help them solve their problems. Only then will they be willing to talk to you intimately and cooperate with you wholeheartedly. This time, we only let you go to Peng Zhengyi alone, and we didn't explain the working methods to you, which is a shortcoming. We should send comrades from the Party to do his work. You should also go and understand his thoughts, help him solve his problems, and become his close friend."
    After this conversation, the young Cao Zitong became happy. He was a member of the Communist Youth League and was determined to integrate with the workers and combine labor with technology, but he lacked a method. At this time, he went to find the workers who were close to Peng Zhengyi to learn about the situation. Sure enough, as the branch secretary had predicted, Peng Zhengyi was angry at the leaders of the raw cotton workshop. When he was first transferred to work on the cotton roll machine, everyone else was promoted from a Grade 3 worker to a Grade 4 worker as soon as they started working on the machine, but he still received his original Grade 3.5 reserved wage. He was very dissatisfied: "Same workers, treated differently!" Although his salary was later adjusted, he still had opinions. Another time, the workers on cotton roll machines No. 1 and No. 2 failed to meet the target for the rate of standard rolls. He went to work on the machine and completed the target, and he also helped the other two comrades complete the target. Who knew that the workshop would ignore this, not only not give him a reward, but not even make a verbal commendation. He felt even more that the workshop leaders treated him differently, so he took every opportunity to complain and make odd remarks. In addition, he didn't plan his life well and had financial difficulties, so he had even more opinions.
    After Cao Zitong learned about these situations, he went to Peng Zhengyi's house one afternoon. Peng Zhengyi lived in a very remote place. He asked many people, turned many corners, and even reached the riverbank, but he still couldn't find it. Just as he was about to turn back, Peng Zhengyi came out of a small house next to him. He went up to him as soon as he saw him.
    Cao Zitong lived in a building in the factory's collective dormitory. He didn't expect Peng Zhengyi to live in such a dilapidated bungalow with such a poor surrounding environment, and he suddenly had an indescribable feeling in his heart. He couldn't help but ask Peng Zhengyi about his living conditions: How many people are there in your family? What is your monthly income? Do you still go to small restaurants to drink? He also helped Peng Zhengyi calculate his family's income and expenses, arrange his life, and advised him to buy alcohol and drink it at home in the future, instead of going to small restaurants, to spend less money. He also cited the example of Wang Shuangying, a female worker in the fine yarn workshop who was rewarded for creating the "roving package splicing method," and encouraged him by saying: "If a person actively improves his technology and does a good job in production, he will contribute more to the country, and the country will give him more rewards."
    Before he went to Peng Zhengyi's house, Party member Zhang Jiachang had already done a lot of individual work with Peng Zhengyi, and his ideological understanding had changed somewhat. At this time, he saw that Cao Zitong was so enthusiastic towards him, and he couldn't help but think: "Everyone used to say that he was a technician who only cared about the machine and didn't care about people, but how come he cares about our workers' lives today? Really, everyone is changing, everyone is progressing!" He was very touched.
    After that, when Peng Zhengyi was on duty, Cao Zitong would go to watch him from the side. When the two met on the road, Cao Zitong would also ask about his well-being and chat with him. Gradually, Peng Zhengyi saw that the workshop leaders attached so much importance to him, so he took the initiative to say: "Technician, you have asked me to talk about my experience many times, but I haven't talked about it. If a person has good experience and doesn't share it, only completes the plan by himself, then the experience won't have any effect. However, I really don't have any special tricks! There are only two movements that are different from others. One is..."
    When Cao Zitong saw that he had shared his experience, he was so excited that he immediately patted him on the shoulder and said: "Okay! Lao Peng, we'll experiment tomorrow."

    他上了群众路线的第一课
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    在提高了机器清除棉花杂质的效能以后，清花车间剩下的关键问题，便是怎样消灭棉卷翘尾巴的现象。
      “翘尾巴”，这是武汉裕华纱厂职工对技术上叫做“棉卷尾码偏重”的通俗称呼，意思是指棉卷最后不足一码的部分过厚、过重，超过了国家规定，“翘”起来了。棉卷最后不足一码的部分，往往多一二钱棉花便超过了规定的重量，很难掌握。工人们，甚至一些先进生产者连续几个月都没有完成同这有关的四个指标。棉卷翘起尾巴，使纺出的棉纱粗细不匀，是提高棉纱质量的一个大障碍。
    最初，技术员曹子通想从改进设备来解决这个问题，始终没弄出个头绪来。工厂党委指示车间从群众的操作中去总结先进经验，依靠群众来解决问题。过去有的技术人员仅仅看一下工人操作，便写上几条经验，结果总结的跟实际情况不符，没法推广。这次，党委针对这个缺点，要求他们必须深入观测研究，同群众——特别是具有先进经验的人商量，把经验真正总结起来。
    根据这个指示，车间普遍检查了工人们的生产纪录，发现彭正义做的棉卷翘尾巴最少，有时一个也没有。
    这个发现使曹子通很兴奋，也很惊异。因为彭正义的混名儿叫“淘气”，是个著名的吊儿浪当的人物。在大家的印象里，他工作平常，却怪话连天。无论在什么正经场合，他都是那句口头禅：“做工拿钱吃饭呗！”时常闹的大家心里不痛快。前些日子，他小孩生病，工会救济了他十元，他又说家里生活困难，还要工人储蓄互助会借钱给他。工人们认为他家的生活是勉强过得去的，只是因为他爱下小馆喝酒，一月花掉七八元，才造成生活困难，不借给他。他当时就火了，坚决要退出互助会，给大家留下了更坏的印象。大家见他站时歪站着，坐时将鞋一脱，双手抱住膝头，也很讨厌，说他“站没个站像，坐没个坐像”。真想不到竟是他在这个关键问题上有了先进经验！
    曹子通马上到机器旁边去观察他操作，见他动作简练、敏捷，比一般人强些，但看不出什么鲜明的特点。曹子通又去找他谈操作体会，一连找了他三次，他都不肯谈。今年才二十二岁的技术员便急了，说：“这个问题不解决，棉纱质量不好，给国家造成损失，我们每个人都有责任啊！”这下子却将彭正义逼火了，他当时就发话：“我这个吊儿浪当的人有啥技术！你要解决问题，找劳动模范去！”
    按照曹子通的想法，哪个工人不愿意领导上总结和推广他的经验呢？想不到彭正义这个“怪人”却让他碰了一鼻子灰！他气鼓鼓地跑去向支部书记兼车间主任钱福佬汇报，见钱福佬半天没作声，他更着急了。
    他简直没有想到，钱福佬竟自我检讨说：“唔，这是对我们工作的批评啦！我们过去只注意表现积极的工人，对表现较差的工人照顾太差，他不免对领导有意见……”接着，钱福佬又问道：“你是怎么跟他谈的？”“我每次都说他的经验好，很虚心的要他把经验谈出来。”谁知钱福佬笑了笑说：“问题就在这里了。他本来对领导就有气，你去找他又光问他要经验，他就把气出在你身上了。”“怎么能怪我呢，”他当时心里很委屈，但没有说出来。钱福佬却像看穿了他的心思，接着又补充说道：
    “曹子通同志，作群众工作不简单啊！要依靠群众，必须首先关心群众，关心他的工作，关心他的生活，帮助他解决问题，他才肯向你谈知心话，跟你同心合作。我们这次光让你一人去找彭正义，也没有给你交代工作方法，是有缺点的。我们要派党内的同志去作他的工作。你也去了解了解他的心思，帮助他解决问题，同他结成知心朋友。”
    经过这次谈话，年轻的曹子通高兴起来了。他是个青年团员，决心同工人打成一片，做到劳动与技术结合，就是缺少办法。这时，他便去找跟彭正义接近的工人了解情况。果然，不出支部书记所料，彭正义在生车间领导的气。他最初调到成卷机上值车，别人都是一上车就由三级工升为四级工，而他仍然是拿原来的三级半的保留工资。他很不满意：“一样工人，两样看待呀！”虽然后来也将他的工资调整了，但他仍然有意见。又一次，第一、二号成卷机上的工人完不成正卷率的指标，他上车去完成了这个指标，还帮助其他两个同志也完成了指标，谁知车间又将这件事忽略了，不仅没给他奖励，连个口头表扬也没作，他更认为车间领导对他两样看待，一有机会便要发发牢骚，说句把怪话。加上他过日子没计划，生活有困难，意见就更多了。
    曹子通了解这些情况后，便在一个下午到彭正义家去了。彭正义住的地方很偏僻，他问了许多人，拐了许多弯，都走到江边了，还没找到。他正准备折回来，彭正义却从旁边的一间小屋里出来了。他一见便迎了上去。
    曹子通住的是工厂集体宿舍的楼房，没有想到彭正义却住在这么破旧的小平房里，四周环境也不好，心里顿时有种说不出的感觉。他情不自禁地便问起彭正义的生活情况来：家有几口人？一月收入多少？还下小馆喝酒么？他还帮助彭正义计算家庭收支，安排生活，劝他以后打酒回家喝，不下小馆，少花钱。他又举出本厂细纱车间女工王双英创造“粗纱包接法”受奖的例子鼓励他说：“一个人积极提高技术，搞好生产，对国家贡献的多，国家给他的报酬也多。”
    在他到彭正义家里以前，党员张家昌已经对彭正义作了许多个别工作，他的思想认识已有些改变。这时，他又见曹子通对他这样热情，不禁想道：“大家过去都说他是个管机器不管人的技术员，怎么他今天也关心起我们工人的生活来了？真是，大家都在变，都在进步啦！”他很感动。
    以后，彭正义值车，曹子通就去旁边看看。两人在路上碰见，曹子通也问长问短，同他聊聊。渐渐，彭正义见车间领导这样重视他，就主动提出来：“技术员，你三番五次找我谈经验，我都没谈。一个人有了好经验不拿出来，光自己一个人完成计划，这经验也不起啥作用。不过，我实在没啥板眼！只是有两个动作跟别人不同。一个是……”
    曹子通一见他把经验谈出来了，真兴奋的不行，马上就拍了拍他的肩头说：“好！老彭，我们明天就来试验。”
