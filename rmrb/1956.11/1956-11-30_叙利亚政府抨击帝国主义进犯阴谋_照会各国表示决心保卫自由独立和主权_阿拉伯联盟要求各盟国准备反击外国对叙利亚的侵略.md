Xinhua News Agency, November 29th, Damascus Dispatch: It was officially announced that the Syrian government handed notes explaining Syrian foreign policy to the American Embassy, the Soviet Embassy, and other countries' embassies here on the 28th.

The official statement said that these notes called attention to the incitement and deception campaigns carried out by imperialism and Israel.

A Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that the aggressor countries are still delaying their withdrawal from Egypt and are relying on directly or through the Baghdad Pact to stir up disputes in Syria.

The spokesperson condemned the imperialist radio stations, news agencies, and their agents. He said that a "deception campaign is part of the imperialist attempt to restore its lost influence in the Arab world."

The spokesperson said: "Syria has adopted an Arab national policy, which is based on positive neutrality and is insulated from bloc and Cold War policies."

He said that Syria is determined to defend its freedom, independence, and sovereignty, and is equally determined to oppose any interference in its internal affairs from any side.

Xinhua News Agency, November 29th, Cairo Dispatch: Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna said on November 28th that Syria may be subjected to foreign aggression soon. He called on the entire Arab world to conduct spiritual and material mobilization to deal with all emergencies.

Hassouna pointed out: "Based on our recent experience, we should not ignore the possibility of events happening."

Xinhua News Agency, November 29th, London Dispatch: A British Foreign Office spokesperson announced on the 27th that Britain is consulting with France and the United States on the situation in Syria. The spokesperson also said that the British government is also in contact with the four member states of the Baghdad Pact that it controls—Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan, and Iran—on this issue.

Agence France-Presse reported that these four countries superficially pretended to ignore Britain, which was isolated due to its aggression against Egypt. On the other hand, Britain has learned through diplomatic channels the results of their meeting held last week. The communique issued by these four countries after the meeting mentioned the need to "take all necessary measures to deal with" the "increasing surge of subversive activities in the Middle East." Agence France-Presse said that Britain hopes to "prevent" Syria's so-called "adventure" through the "serious warnings" and "firm stance" of Iraq, Turkey, and Pakistan.

At the same time, the U.S. State Department is also attempting to create excuses for interfering in Syria. State Department officials said they have been "concerned" about "reports of the growing influence of communists in Syria."

Under the planning of Western countries, Syria is in serious danger of being subjected to military attack.

Xinhua News Agency, November 29th, Cairo Dispatch: Former Egyptian Minister of State and Editor-in-Chief of "The Republic" Anwar Sadat accused Turkey on the 28th of planning to attack Syria.

Sadat said that Turkey hopes to pull Syria into the Baghdad Pact group by attacking it.

Sadat said that Turkey's fabricated claim that Soviet weapons and volunteers are entering Syria is to create an excuse for the attack.

Sadat also accused Turkey of having prompted Britain to attack Egypt first through the Baghdad Pact. He said that Turkey expected Syria to help Egypt, that Egypt would be quickly defeated, and then it could launch a coup in Syria under the pretext of anti-communism.

He pointed out that this plan failed due to Egypt's firm resistance and President Nasser's decision that Syria should not immediately participate in the battle.

Sadat said: "Let us warn Turkey not to carry out this crazy adventure of attacking Syria, because it cannot think it is more powerful than Britain and France, or than the NATO equipment that was defeated in Port Said."

    叙利亚政府抨击帝国主义进犯阴谋
    照会各国表示决心保卫自由独立和主权
    阿拉伯联盟要求各盟国准备反击外国对叙利亚的侵略
    新华社29日讯　大马士革消息：官方宣布，叙利亚政府28日把解释叙利亚外交政策的照会分别交给这里的美国大使馆、苏联大使馆以及其他国家的使馆。
    官方的声明说，这些照会要求注意帝国主义和以色列所进行的煽动和欺骗运动。
    一位外交部发言人说，侵略国还迟迟不从埃及撤军，而且正在依靠直接地或通过巴格达条约在叙利亚挑起纠纷。
    这位发言人抨击了帝国主义的广播电台、通讯社以及它们的代理人。他说，一个“欺骗运动是帝国主义企图恢复它在阿拉伯世界中失去的势力的尝试的一部分”。
    这位发言人说：“叙利亚已经采取了阿拉伯的民族政策，这项政策是以积极中立为基础的，是同集团和冷战政策绝缘的。”
    他说，叙利亚决心要保卫它的自由、独立和主权，它同样地决心要反对任何方面干涉它的内政。
    新华社29日讯　开罗消息：阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳11月28日说，叙利亚可能会在最近遭到外国的侵略。他要求整个阿拉伯世界进行精神上和物质上的动员来对付一切突发事变。
    哈苏纳指出：“从我们最近的经验来看，我们不应当忽视发生事件的可能性。”
    新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人27日宣布，英国正在就叙利亚局势同法国和美国进行磋商。发言人还说，英国政府也在就这个问题同它所主使的巴格达条约的四个成员国——土耳其、伊拉克、巴基斯坦和伊朗——保持接触。
    法新社消息说，这四个国家表面上假装不理睬因为侵略埃及而陷于孤立的英国，另一方面，英国已经通过外交途径获知了它们在上周举行的会议的结果。这四个国家在会议后发表的公报曾经谈到要“采取一切必要的措施来对付”“中东颠覆活动的日益高涨的浪潮”。法新社说，英国希望通过伊拉克、土耳其和巴基斯坦的“严重警告”和“坚定态度”来“防止”叙利亚的所谓“冒险”。
    和这同时，美国国务院也企图为干涉叙利亚制造借口。国务院的官员们说，他们一直“关切地”注视着关于“共产党在叙利亚的势力越来越大的消息”。
    在西方国家策划下，叙利亚正处在遭受军事进攻的严重危险中。
    新华社29日讯　开罗消息：埃及前国务部长、“共和国报”主编安瓦尔·萨达特28日指责土耳其计划攻击叙利亚。
    萨达特说，土耳其指望用攻击叙利亚的办法来把它拉进巴格达条约集团。
    萨达特说，土耳其所捏造的关于苏联的武器和志愿人员进入叙利亚的说法，是为进攻制造借口。
    萨达特还指责说，土耳其已经通过巴格达条约，促使英国首先进攻埃及。他说，土耳其预计叙利亚会去帮助埃及，埃及会很快地被击败，然后就可以以反共为借口，在叙利亚发动政变。
    他指出，这项计划由于埃及的坚决抵抗和纳赛尔总统所作的叙利亚不应该立即参加战斗的决定而遭到失败。
    萨达特说：“让我们警告土耳其不要进行攻击叙利亚这种疯狂的冒险，因为它不能自以为比英国和法国或比在塞得港被打垮的北大西洋公约组织的装备还来得厉害。”
