    The Egyptian Government Agrees to UN Forces in Egypt
    Solemnly Declares that Stationed Troops Must Not Violate Egyptian Sovereignty
    President Nasser Receives International Force Commander Burns
    Xinhua News Agency, November 13th: Cairo dispatch: According to an official announcement on the evening of November 12th, the Egyptian government has agreed to the entry of United Nations police forces into Egyptian territory, on the condition that their stationing does not violate Egyptian sovereignty.
    The Egyptian government held negotiations with UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to discuss the implementation of the UN General Assembly's resolution demanding the withdrawal of British, French, and Israeli troops from Egypt and the establishment of a UN police force. It was announced that both sides reached an agreement on the points that the Egyptian government had requested clarification on in the afternoon of the 12th.
    According to the agreement, the countries allowed to send troops to participate in the UN forces in Egypt, each dispatch or transport of troops, and the location where the UN forces are stationed, all require the consent of Egypt. If Egypt requests the withdrawal of the UN forces, they must withdraw immediately. After the withdrawal of British and French troops—British and French troops must withdraw immediately in accordance with the UN General Assembly resolution—the UN forces will have no tasks in Port Said and the Suez Canal area. At that time, the work of the UN forces will be limited to the armistice line between Israel and Egypt demarcated in 1949, if Egypt agrees to these troops remaining.
    Egyptian President Nasser received the commander of the UN police force, Burns, on the 12th. On the same day, the first batch of UN truce observers, led by U.S. Colonel Newton Nelson, arrived in Cairo.
    Xinhua News Agency, November 13th: New York dispatch: UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld announced at a press conference on the 12th that he had reached an agreement with the Egyptian government on the entry of the UN "International Emergency Force" into Egypt, and the first personnel of this force will go to Egypt at the beginning of this week. He also announced that he would leave New York on the afternoon of the 13th to go to Cairo to discuss the details with the Egyptian government. After that, he will go to Rome to discuss with the Canadian commander of this UN force, Burns.
    In answering questions from reporters, Hammarskjöld added that he did not intend to discuss the withdrawal of the invading troops from Egypt with Britain, France, and Israel. He said: "This is the work of the staff department, and therefore under the jurisdiction of General Burns, and not within the scope of my trip."
    Xinhua News Agency, November 12th: TASS Cairo dispatch: According to newspaper reports, the Egyptian government decided at a meeting on the evening of November 11th to send a delegation headed by Foreign Minister Fawzi to attend the UN General Assembly meeting on November 15th.

    埃政府同意联合国部队到埃及
    郑重声明驻扎部队不得侵犯埃及主权
    纳赛尔总统接见了国际部队司令伯恩斯
    新华社13日讯　开罗消息：据官方11月12日晚间宣布，埃及政府已经同意联合国警察部队进入埃及领土，条件是它的驻扎不得侵犯埃及主权。
    埃及政府同联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德举行了谈判，讨论关于履行联合国大会通过的要求英、法和以色列军队撤出埃及和建立联合国警察部队的决议的问题。据宣布，双方在12日下午就埃及政府要求澄清的各点达成了协议。
    根据协议，哪些国家得以派军队参加在埃及的联合国部队，每一次派入或者运入军队，联合国军队驻在什么地方，都需要得到埃及的同意。如果埃及要求联合国部队撤走的话，它必须立刻撤走。在英法军队撤走以后——英法军队必须依照联合国大会决议立即撤退——联合国部队在塞得港和苏伊士运河区将没有任何任务。那时候，联合国部队的工作将限定在1949年划定的以色列和埃及停战线上，如果埃及同意这些部队留下来的话。
    埃及总统纳赛尔12日接见了联合国警察部队司令伯恩斯。同一天，以美国的纽顿·纳尔逊上校为首的第一批联合国停战观察员到达开罗。
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德12日在记者招待会上宣布，他同埃及政府已经就联合国“国际紧急部队”进入埃及的问题达成协议，这支部队的第一批人员将在本星期初去埃及。还宣布，他将在13日下午离开纽约前往开罗，以便同埃及政府讨论细节问题。这以后，他还要去罗马同这支联合国部队的加拿大籍司令伯恩斯商谈。
    哈马舍尔德在答复记者提出的问题时补充说，他不准备同英、法、以色列三国商谈从埃及撤退它们的侵略军队的问题。他说：“这是参谋部门的工作，因此属伯恩斯将军的管辖，而不在我这次旅行的范围以内。”
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社开罗讯：据报纸消息，埃及政府在11月11日晚间举行的一次会议上决定派以外交部长法齐为首的代表团在11月15日去出席联合国大会会议。
