Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The Central Bureau of Handicraft Industry and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Handicraft Cooperative Union recently issued a notice to the handicraft departments of various places on quickly resolving the current tense situation of sewing cotton clothes.

The notice pointed out that since the beginning of winter, a tense situation of "no place to sew winter clothes in October" has occurred in many large and medium-sized cities, and even some counties, cities, and market towns. The cotton clothing processing period of many sewing production cooperatives is generally about a month, and some have postponed the delivery date to next year, and some have even posted notices saying "temporarily not accepting work." This situation has seriously affected the people's ability to keep warm through the winter, causing public dissatisfaction.

Although the output of the sewing industry has increased significantly since the realization of cooperation, it still cannot meet the growing needs of the people's lives. The reasons for this tense situation are, first, the development of socialist economic construction, the increase in the number of employed people, and the general increase in wages of workers across the country have significantly increased the number of clothes needed by society. During the peak season for clothing sales in Beijing last year, many cooperatives were still soliciting work everywhere due to product backlogs, but this year it is "not light in the off-season, and even busier in the peak season." From January to October this year, the number of single and cotton clothes processed in batches by Beijing sewing cooperatives increased by one time compared to the whole of last year, but it is still in short supply. At the same time, the people's requirements for the quality and variety of clothing have also increased compared to the past, which has relatively increased working hours and affected output. Second, the labor organization and distribution of service points of some handicraft cooperatives are still unreasonable. After some handicraft cooperatives were organized, they neglected the original production and sales law of "using the busy season to support the off-season" of handicrafts. They mechanically implemented "standardization" in the work system and working hours, still implementing an eight-and-a-half or nine-hour work system in the peak season (it used to be generally more than twelve hours). In this way, the increase in the number of products is affected, and the needs of the masses cannot be met in time. Third, some commercial departments lack reasonable arrangements for ordering plans, have insufficient reserves in the off-season, and order a large amount of processing from handicrafts in the peak season, resulting in crowding together with the retail services of clothing stores that directly serve the public. Due to the unreasonable unit price of some wages, some cooperatives are willing to do batch processing, but unwilling to do retail services, and some are willing to make single clothes, but unwilling to make cotton clothes. Fourth, in addition to the shortage of skilled workers for high-end fine work, the number of general sewing workers in some places also appears to be insufficient.

The notice stated that the handicraft departments in Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Zhangjiakou and other places have basically reversed the tense situation of sewing cotton clothes by taking some active measures. It requires the handicraft departments of various places to refer to these measures and quickly resolve them under the unified leadership of the local party and government based on the specific circumstances of the local area.

These measures are: (1) Service sewing cooperatives should stop processing goods in batches and restore direct service to the masses. Compress the delivery date to the minimum, and separately prioritize, mastering the principle of making cotton clothes first, then single clothes, making retail services first, and then processing small batches. Strengthen the education of members and the inspection and acceptance of products to prevent shoddy products from occurring.

(2) Rationally adjust the labor organization and the distribution of service points. Strengthen the mutual support between decentralized service stations and centralized production cooperatives. Adjust the phenomenon of uneven production tasks between cooperatives and individual households, and between prosperous and remote areas.

(3) According to the production characteristics of handicrafts catching up with work in the peak season, working hours can be extended or shifts can be added on the basis of strengthening education and voluntariness. In this way, it can not only meet the needs of society, but also increase the income of members under the principle of "to each according to his work." In practice, in addition to giving full play to the strength of the current production cooperatives, the time and system for members to participate in amateur schools and literacy studies can also be re-adjusted. If necessary, the amount or frequency of learning can be reduced; meetings and necessary social activities can be streamlined; management work should also be changed accordingly with the extension of production time, such as the receipt and distribution of raw materials, acceptance of finished products, etc.

(4) In addition to giving full play to the strength of handicraft cooperative organizations, state-owned and joint state-private sewing forces are also required to act in a unified manner. Extra-cooperative labor forces such as unlicensed households and household sideline households should be given full play. Some can be absorbed into the cooperative, some can be processed outside the cooperative, and some should be allowed to directly meet with the masses and should not be blindly restricted. Sewing workers who have originally switched careers in some areas can also resume their original careers if they have no other difficulties. Cooperatives (groups) that originally made sewing sundries can also undertake part of the cotton work to expand the processing surface.

(5) Strengthen ideological leadership. Higher-level cooperatives should help grassroots cooperatives solve specific problems, improve the ideology of members, and correct the idea that members are willing to take on large batches of work, but unwilling to do sporadic work, so that members understand that this work is related to the clothing problem of the people and should be completed as a political task.

### 迅速改变缝制棉衣的紧张状况  中央手工业管理局等通知各地采取积极措施

    迅速改变缝制棉衣的紧张状况
    中央手工业管理局等通知各地采取积极措施
    新华社18日讯　中央手工业管理局和全国手工业合作总社筹委会最近向各地手工业部门发出了关于迅速解决目前缝制棉衣的紧张状况的通知。
    这个通知指出，入冬以来，全国许多大中城市，甚至一些县市、集镇，都发生了“十月寒衣无处缝”的紧张情况。许多缝纫生产合作社的棉衣加工期限，一般都在一个月左右，有的已将交活期限推到明年，有的甚至贴出了“暂不收活”的条子。这种情况，严重地影响了群众的防寒过冬，引起了群众的不满。
    缝纫业在实现了合作化以后，虽然产量比过去有了显著的增加，但是仍然不能适应人民生活日益增长的需要。产生这种紧张情况的原因，首先是社会主义经济建设的发展、劳动就业人数增加和全国职工工资的普遍提高，使社会需要的服装数量显著增加。北京市在去年服装销售旺季，很多合作社还因产品积压而到处揽活，今年则是“淡季不淡，旺季更旺”。今年1月份到10月份，北京市缝纫社成批加工的单衣和棉衣，虽然比去年全年增加了一倍，但仍然供不应求。同时，人民群众对服装质量、花色品种的要求，也比过去提高，这就相对地增加了工时，影响到产量。其次，一部分手工业合作社的劳动组织和服务点的分布尚不合理，一部分手工业合作社在组织起来以后，忽视手工业原有“以旺养淡”的产销规律，在工作制度和工作时间上，机械地实行“正规化”，在旺季仍然实行八小时半或九小时工作制（过去一般在十二小时以上），这样，就影响产品数量的增加，使群众需要得不到及时满足。第三，有些商业部门对要货计划缺乏合理安排，淡季储备不足，旺季向手工业大量加工订货，以致与为市民直接服务的服装门市部零活挤在一起。由于部分工资单价的不够合理，以致有些合作社愿作成批加工活，不愿作门市零活，有些愿作单衣，不愿作棉衣。第四，目前除了做高级细活的技术工人不足外，一般缝纫工人的数量，在某些地方，也出现了不够的现象。
    这个通知中说，目前北京、天津、重庆、张家口等地的手工业部门，由于采取了一些积极措施，基本上扭转了缝制棉衣的紧张局面。要求各地手工业部门参照这些措施，根据当地具体情况，在当地党和政府的统一领导下迅速加以解决。
    这些措施是：（一）服务性缝纫社停止成批商品加工，恢复直接为群众服务。把交活日期压缩到最低限度，并分别缓急，掌握先做棉衣、后做单衣，先做门市零活、后做小批加工的原则。加强社员的教育和产品的检查、验收工作，防止粗制滥造现象的发生。
    （二）合理调整劳动组织和服务点的分布。加强分散服务站和集中生产社的互相支援。对合作社与单干户、繁华区和偏僻区生产任务忙闲不均的现象也要加以调整。
    （三）根据手工业旺季赶活的生产特点，在加强教育和自愿的基础上，可以延长工时，也可以增开班次。这样，既能满足社会需要，又能在“按劳取酬”的原则下增加社员的收入。在做法上，除把现在生产社的力量全部发挥外，还可以把社员参加业余学校和扫盲学习的时间和制度，重新加以调整。必要时，可以减少学习分量或次数；精简会议和必要的社会活动；管理工作也应随着生产时间的延长作相应的改变，如原材料的领发，成品验收等。
    （四）除充分发挥手工业合作组织的力量以外，国营的和公私合营的缝纫力量也要求能统一行动。对无照户、家庭副业户等社外劳动力，应当充分加以发挥。有的可以吸收入社，有的可以进行社外加工，有的应当允许他们直接和群众见面，不得盲目加以限制。有些地区原来已转业的缝纫工人，如果没有其他困难，也可以恢复原业。原来作缝纫杂品的合作社（组），也可以承担一部分棉活，以扩大加工面。
    （五）、加强思想领导。上级社应帮助基层社解决具体问题，提高社员思想，纠正社员愿揽大批活，不愿做零星活等思想，使社员了解到这项工作关系到人民群众的穿衣问题，应该当作一项政治任务来完成。
