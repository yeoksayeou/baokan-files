    Spouting Nonsense
    After Britain and France launched the most barbaric and blatant aggression against Egypt, even the most cunning politicians in the invading group could not find a suitable excuse to defend themselves. They say this today and that tomorrow; this one says this, and that one says that. Spouting nonsense, with no fixed standard. They are just like a group of captured accomplices, babbling and denying their crimes in court.
    In the stage of preparing for war, Eden and Mollet claimed that they were fighting to "maintain the freedom and security of navigation on the canal." However, as soon as they found Israel as a tool to provoke the war, they immediately changed their tune, describing their aggression as "stopping the Israeli-Egyptian conflict" and "maintaining peace in the Middle East." However, a few days later, the British Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd suddenly came up with another novel idea—to stop "Russian infiltration in the Middle East" and prevent "the region from falling into the hands of the Soviet Union." According to him, the British and French armed aggression against Egypt had "disrupted the Soviet Union's meticulously planned scheme."
    It is not surprising that the aggressors are talking nonsense in front of the world's court of justice, trying to cover up their crimes. In order to deceive some people, they usually want to make their lies sound more plausible. However, Lennox-Boyd's sophistry, in addition to completely exposing the true colors of this colonial secretary, is something that even he himself would not believe. According to him, it seems that the Middle Eastern countries cannot have their own sovereignty, nor do they know how to defend their own sovereignty; their just struggle to safeguard their national sovereignty is just a "scheme arranged" by the Soviet Union. This excuse of using anti-Sovietism as a pretext for their aggression is exactly the leftover of the fascist Hitler!

    信口雌黄
    英法对埃及发动最野蛮、最露骨的侵略之后，侵略集团中最善于狡辩的政客们也找不到合适的借口来为自己辩护了。他们今天这样说，明天就那样说；这个这样说，那个就那样说。信口雌黄，毫无定准。活像一批被捉住了的同谋犯，在法庭上面胡言乱语，抵赖自己的罪行。
    在准备战争的阶段，艾登和摩勒声称，他们是要为“维护运河的航行自由和安全”而战的。但是，等到他们找到了以色列作为启衅工具之后，他们马上就改口，把他们的侵略行动说成是为了“制止以埃冲突”、“维护中东和平”。但是，不几天之后，英国的殖民大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德忽然又别出心裁地发明了另外一种新说法——为了制止“俄国在中东的渗入”，防止“这个地区落到苏联的手里”。据他说，英法对埃及的武装侵略行动，已经“打乱了苏联的经过周密布置的计划”。
    在世界正义法庭面前，侵略者急不暇择地胡说八道，企图掩盖自己的罪行，这是毫不足怪的。他们为了能够欺骗一些人，通常总想把自己的谎话讲得像样一点。可是，伦诺克斯—波伊德的狡辩，却除了彻底暴露这位殖民大臣的本相以外，是连他自己也不会相信的。照他的说法，似乎中东国家不能有自己的主权，也不知道要捍卫自己的主权；它们维护自己民族主权的正义斗争，只不过是苏联“布置的计划”。这种以反苏作为自己进行侵略的借口，正是法西斯希特勒的余唾！
