Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 17th: The Czechoslovak News Agency reports that the Czechoslovak government delegation, headed by Prime Minister Široký, arrived in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, on the 15th for a visit and held talks with the leaders of the Hungarian government.

    During the talks, the two sides discussed the international situation, the situation in Hungary, and issues related to the assistance provided by the Czechoslovak people to the Hungarian working people who are in economic difficulties.

    Participating in the talks on the Hungarian side were: Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Republic; Kádár, Prime Minister of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government; Marosán, Minister of State; Opró, Minister of Heavy Industry; Rónai, Minister of Trade; Sebes, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and other officials. On the Czechoslovak side were: Prime Minister Široký, Šlechta, Chairman of the State Construction Committee; Procházka, Minister of Health and Chairman of the Czechoslovak People's Party; Kyselý, Minister of Local Industry; Šimovič, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs; Hloch, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, and others.

    At the beginning of the talks, Prime Minister Kádár warmly welcomed the Czechoslovak government delegation and expressed his gratitude to the Czechoslovak people for their selfless assistance to the Hungarian working people. He also explained the situation in Hungary in detail.

    The talks ended that evening. Subsequently, the Czechoslovak government delegation left Budapest and returned to Prague.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 17th: A joint statement signed by the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic and the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic during the visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to Hungary was published here.

    The statement said that on November 15th, the Czechoslovak government delegation visited Budapest to discuss with the Hungarian government certain urgent issues of common interest to both countries arising from the current situation.

    The Hungarian government delegation informed the Czechoslovak government delegation of the events that had occurred in the past few weeks and the current difficult situation.

    The Czechoslovak government delegation noted with satisfaction that the measures taken by the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government had achieved great success in curbing the counter-revolutionary danger, defending the people's democratic system and its achievements, and restoring law and order in the country.

    The Hungarian government delegation expressed its gratitude to the Czechoslovak government and people for their assistance in curbing the counter-revolutionary danger and overcoming economic difficulties.

    Both sides pointed out that when Hungary was facing the threat of the overthrow of the people's democratic system, the restoration of capitalism, and the re-establishment of fascist dictatorship, the Hungarian government, considering its responsibility to the people, exercised its sovereignty and, in accordance with the principles of international law, requested the assistance of Soviet troops to defend the people's democratic system, establish order, and restore domestic tranquility.

    The governments of Hungary and Czechoslovakia, based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, firmly believe that the problems in the future development of the Hungarian events are entirely within the jurisdiction of the relevant institutions of the Hungarian People's Republic. Therefore, certain resolutions passed by the United Nations that violate this principle cannot be considered legal. The two governments hope that the future actions of the United Nations will respect the principle of non-interference in Hungary's internal affairs.

    In discussing the current international situation, both sides first reaffirmed the unwavering desire and will of the two governments to safeguard and consolidate world peace. The international imperialist forces, thirsting for war, are frightened by the easing of international tensions and the growth of the forces of peace, freedom, democracy, and socialism throughout the world. They are using every means to try to turn back the wheel of history, even in certain regions. The evidence of this is that the imperialist forces hope to alienate the countries of the socialist camp, attempting in this way to restore capitalism in individual countries, thereby weakening the main and decisive force defending the cause of world peace—the socialist camp. The reactionary forces' attempt to use the events that occurred in Hungary not long ago to eliminate the democratic system, restore capitalism, and establish a fascist dictatorship in Hungary is undoubtedly also part of the above-mentioned efforts.

    The proof of this is that, under the condemnation of world opinion, Britain, France, and Israel continue to carry out their despicable aggression against Egypt, wanting to stop the great movement of the peoples of Asia and Africa striving for independence and the complete elimination of the colonial system.

    The Hungarian government and the Czechoslovak government firmly believe that the aggression against the Egyptian people must be stopped, the path to further aggravation of international tensions must be blocked, the resurgence of the "Cold War" must be prevented, and at the same time, effective measures must be taken immediately to strengthen and consolidate world peace, to carry out disarmament, to prohibit weapons of mass destruction, and to realize an effective collective security system. The principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems should triumph throughout the world.

    The two governments expressed their determination to continue to develop and deepen relations between the two countries in the spirit of existing agreements in the future, and to strive to promote the further consolidation of friendship and the development of fraternal cooperation in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life.

    The two governments firmly believe that the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, relying on the victorious achievements of millions of Hungarian people, relying on the people's talent and hard work, and cooperating fraternally with all socialist countries, will certainly be able to overcome the current difficulties and guarantee the Hungarian people's path to happiness and the building of socialism.

    就当前局势所引起的某些迫切问题
    匈捷两国政府发表联合声明
    新华社布拉格17日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社讯：以西罗基总理为首的捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团在15日到达匈牙利首都布达佩斯访问，并且同匈牙利政府的领导人举行了会谈。
    会谈时，双方讨论了国际局势、匈牙利局势以及有关捷克斯洛伐克人民对处于经济困难中的匈牙利劳动人民提供援助等问题。
    参加会谈的，匈牙利方面有：人民共和国主席团主席道比，工农革命政府总理卡达尔，国务部长马罗山，重工业部长奥普罗，贸易部长罗奈伊，外交部副部长谢贝什和其他官员；捷克斯洛伐克方面有：西罗基总理，国家建设委员会主席斯列赫塔，卫生部长、天主教人民党主席普罗伊哈，地方工业部长基塞利，外交部副部长西莫维茨和对外贸易部副部长赫洛克等人。
    会谈开始以后，卡达尔总理在发言中热烈欢迎捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团，并且感谢捷克斯洛伐克人民对匈牙利劳动人民的无私援助。他还详细地说明了匈牙利局势。
    会谈在当天晚上结束。随后，捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团就离开布达佩斯返回布拉格。
    新华社布拉格17日电　这里发表了匈牙利人民共和国政府和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府在捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团访问匈牙利期间签署的联合声明。
    声明说，11月15日捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团访问了布达佩斯，以便同匈牙利政府讨论由当前局势引起的同两国利益有关的某些迫切问题。
    匈牙利政府代表团把上几周内发生的事件和当前的困难局势通知了捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团满意地注意到，匈牙利工农革命政府所采取的措施已在制止反革命危险、保卫人民民主制度及其成果以及在恢复国内法律秩序等方面取得了很大的成就。
    匈牙利政府代表团向捷克斯洛伐克政府和人民表示感激，感谢他们在制止反革命危险以及在克服经济困难方面所给予的帮助。
    双方指出，当匈牙利面临人民民主制度被推翻、资本主义复辟和再建法西斯独裁的威胁的时候，匈牙利政府考虑到它对人民所负的责任，使用自己的主权，根据国际法原则，请求苏联军队协助保卫人民民主制度，建立秩序和恢复国内的安宁。
    匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克两国政府根据联合国宪章的原则，坚决认为匈牙利事件今后发展中的问题完全是匈牙利人民共和国有关机构职权范围内的事。因此，联合国通过的某些违背这个原则的决议不能认为是合法的。两国政府希望，联合国今后的行动将尊重不干涉匈牙利内政的原则。
    在讨论当前的国际局势问题的时候，双方首先重申了两国政府维护和巩固世界和平的不可动摇的愿望和意志。渴望战争的国际帝国主义势力被国际紧张局势的缓和以及和平、自由、民主和社会主义力量在全世界的增长吓慌了，它们用尽一切办法，希望那怕在某些地区内使历史车轮倒转。这一点的证据就是，帝国主义势力希望离间社会主义阵营国家，企图用这种方法使资本主义在个别国家中复辟，从而削弱保卫世界和平事业的主要的和决定性的力量——社会主义阵营。反动势力企图利用不久以前在匈牙利发生的事件来消灭民主制度、恢复资本主义和在匈牙利建立法西斯独裁，无疑地这也是上述努力的一部分。
    这一点的证明就是，英、法和以色列在全世界舆论谴责之下继续对埃及进行卑鄙的侵略，想要阻止亚非人民声势浩大的争取独立、争取完全消灭殖民体系的伟大运动。
    匈牙利政府和捷克斯洛伐克政府不动摇地认为：必须终止对埃及人民的侵略，堵塞国际紧张局势继续加剧的道路，阻止“冷战”的再起，同时必须立即采取有效措施来加强和巩固世界和平，来进行裁军、禁止大规模毁灭性武器并且实现有效的集体安全体系。不同社会制度的各国和平共处的原则应当在全世界取得胜利。
    两国政府表示，决心在今后继续根据现有的各种协定的精神发展和加深两国间的关系，并且竭力促进友谊的进一步巩固，发展在政治、经济和文化生活各方面的兄弟合作。
    两国政府坚信，匈牙利工农革命政府依靠千百万匈牙利人民的胜利成果，依靠人民的才能和勤劳，同全体社会主义国家兄弟般地团结合作，一定能够克服目前的困难，为匈牙利人民保证走向幸福和建成社会主义的道路。
