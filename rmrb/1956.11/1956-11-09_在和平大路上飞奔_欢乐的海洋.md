    Speeding on the Road of Peace
    An Ocean of Joy
    Jin Yi

    On July 13, 1956, the workers of the First Automobile Factory, with selfless and enthusiastic labor, wrote the glorious first page of China's automobile manufacturing history, just on the eve of the factory's third anniversary.

    The celebration of the factory's third anniversary was held at the automobile workers' club. Inside the factory, the girls were carefully dressing up the twelve Liberation-brand automobiles that were about to meet the people of Changchun. The selected drivers had already put on brand-new work clothes and white gloves, standing guard beside the cars they were about to drive. They were like excellent knights, standing beside their steeds, stroking the shiny car bodies from time to time. The leader, Ma Guofan, had calluses on his hands from gripping the steering wheel for twenty-six years. He had driven everything from one-and-a-half-ton to ten-ton trucks; but this was the first time he had driven our own car. When he sat in the driver's seat, every Chinese character on the instrument panel smiled at him, like his old friends, accurately and loudly telling him: how many kilometers traveled, how much fuel used, the speed of travel… Little Song, who was driving the fourth car, pulled the car door handle as if holding her mother's hand, stepping up, just about to go in, when someone suddenly asked her, "Is this the car you're driving?" Was it envy, jealousy; was it contempt, or distrust? For a moment she couldn't speak, her eyes suddenly filled with tears, as if it were the first day she held the steering wheel, both happy and afraid, finally summoning up the courage, nodding repeatedly, clumsily saying, "Yes, yes, it's me!" In fact, she could have answered loudly and confidently: "Yes, it's me, do you have a problem with that?"

    At one o'clock in the afternoon, the twelve cars were full of people; the roofs of the entire factory, the windows of the buildings, the roadsides, even the flowerbeds… everywhere there was room to stand was filled with people. When the cars slowly started moving, cheers and applause rang out, the hot and quiet air of the summer noon was stirred up. Everyone could find his fingerprint, a drop of sweat, a contribution, on the car, like a mother watching her child taking its first steps, their hearts filled with joy and a little worry. On the main road inside the factory, the cars drove slowly. Because people were reluctant to let them go, they surrounded them tightly; they were also reluctant to leave the place where they were born.

    Outside the automobile factory, the wives and children of the automobile factory workers surrounded them again. The old fathers and mothers also waved at the cars. This was the car that their loved ones had made with their own hands, working from dawn till dusk, this was the car that brought happiness to the Chinese people; how they wanted to get closer and touch it; but the drivers remembered that tens of thousands of people in Changchun were waiting, they couldn't delay any longer. The children, however, didn't care about anything, running alongside the cars. A child less than three feet tall, wearing a yellow vest, ran beside the car with his little legs, falling and getting up, chasing from a small road. Old Li Tou in the car got anxious, he shouted: "Whose child is so disobedient, in this hot weather, what if they get sick from running!" But when he wiped away the tears that flowed because of excitement, he sighed: "It turns out to be my grandson!" He had to shout again: "Little Zhu Zi, go back quickly, tell your grandma, our cars have left the factory." The child shouted while running: "No need to tell, Grandma is already watching from the window."

    After passing the Changchun Film Studio is the Provincial Hospital, and further on is the Automotive Manufacturing School—actors, doctors, nurses, students, walking citizens… the cheers merged into one. Patients who couldn't come out leaned out of the windows to applaud, they also kept turning their heads to point and tell the good news to patients who couldn't get out of bed.

    On the road, several empty trucks, running at full power, caught up from behind, the drivers poked their heads out of the car windows, looked, nodded excitedly and said: "This is our car!" Only then were they satisfied and turned onto another road. At the railway crossing, even on the windows of the fleeting train, were full of smiling faces of passengers.

    Entering Changchun City, the cars drove into an ocean of joy. Flowers and colored paper fell like rain on the cars and the people, even the big trees on both sides lowered their branches and gently brushed the car bodies. The children shouted repeatedly: "Liberation brand, Liberation brand!" People touched it up and down, left and right, their faces flashing with joy and happiness. The elderly wiped their eyes again and again, reading out: "First Automobile Manufacturing Factory." Changchun used to be the heart of the enemy's rule in the Northeast, the enemy's stronghold, the people of Changchun had suffered the most cruel oppression and humiliation from the enemy. The enemy originally cultivated killing bacteria in Mengjiatun; but today, the Party is leading the people to build the First Automobile Factory there, the automobile factory is the hope of Changchun and the people of the whole country, when hope becomes reality, our car came out of the factory in three years.

    在和平大路上飞奔
    欢乐的海洋
    靳以
    在1956年7月13日，第一汽车厂的工人们用忘我热情的劳动，写下了中国制造汽车史光荣的第一页，这正是建厂三周年的前夕。
    庆祝建厂三年的大会是在汽车工人俱乐部举行的，在厂内，姑娘们正在细心打扮着即将和长春人民见面的十二辆解放牌汽车。推选出来的司机们，早就穿好了崭新的工作服，戴上雪白的手套，守在自己将要驾驶的车旁。他们正像优良的骑士，站在骏马的身边，不时爱抚地摸着发亮的车身，领队的马国藩，他紧握二十六年方向盘的双手都已磨出了老茧，从一吨半一直到十吨的汽车他都驾驶过；可是他还是第一次驾驶咱们自己的汽车。当他坐在驾驶室里，面前仪表上的每个中国字都向他笑，像他的老朋友一样，将准确地大声告诉他：走了多少公里，用了多少油，行车的速度……驾驶第四辆车的小宋，像扯着母亲的手似地拉着车门的把手，一脚踏上去，正要走进去，突然一个人向她问：“这辆就是你驾驶么？”是羡慕，是嫉妒；是轻视，还是不信任？一时间她说不出话来，她的眼睛里突然涨满了泪水，好像她第一天握着驾驶盘，又高兴又怕，终于鼓足了勇气，不迭地点头，拙笨地说：“是，是，是我！”其实她正可以理直气壮地大声回答：“不错，是我，难道你有意见么？”
    下午一点钟，十二辆汽车上坐满了人；全厂的屋顶上，楼窗上，大小的路边，甚至花圃上……凡是放得下脚的地方都站满了人。当汽车缓缓地开动的时候，欢呼和掌声响成了一片，夏天中午炎热而宁静的空气都被掀动起来了。每个人都在汽车上找得到他的一个手印，一滴汗水、一份功绩，像母亲看着自己学步的孩子，心中充满了喜悦和一点点耽心。在厂内的大路上，汽车缓缓地行驶着。因为人们舍不得它们，把它们紧紧围起来；它们也留恋着自己诞生的地方。
    出了汽车厂，汽车厂工人们的妻子儿女们又围在两旁。年老的爸爸妈妈们也向着汽车招手。这就是他们的亲人起早睡晚用双手造出来的汽车，这就是给中国人民带来了幸福的汽车；他们多么想靠拢来摸摸呵；可是驾驶员记得长春几万人在等待着，他们不能再耽搁。孩子们却什么也不顾，随着汽车奔跑。一个不到三尺高穿黄背心的孩子，撒开两只小腿追在车旁，跌倒了就爬起来，又从小路追上来。汽车上的老李头急了，他嚷着：“谁家的孩子这么不听话，大热的天，跑出病来可怎么办！”可是当他抹去因为兴奋而流出的泪水，他才叹了一口气：“原来是我的孙子！”他只得又大声喊叫：“小柱子，快回去，告诉你老奶奶，咱们的汽车出厂了。”那孩子边跑边叫：“不用告诉，老奶奶早在窗口上瞧呢。”
    过了长春电影制片厂就是省立医院，再过去就是汽车制造学校——演员，医生，护士，学生，走路的市民……把欢呼连成一片。不能跑出来的病人从窗口探出身子来鼓掌，他们还不断地回过头去指指点点，把好消息告诉给不能起床的病人。
    在大路上，几辆空卡车开足了马力从后边赶上来，驾驶员从车窗探出头来，望了望，兴奋地点着头说：“这就是咱们的汽车！”这他们才心满意足地转到另外一条道路上去了。在铁路交叉点上，连一闪即逝的火车的窗口上，也挂满了乘客的欢笑的脸。
    进了长春市，汽车就驶进了欢乐的海洋。鲜花，彩纸像雨似地落在车上和人们的身上，连两旁的大树也垂下了枝条轻轻拂在车身上。孩子们不迭口地叫着：“解放牌，解放牌！”人们上下左右地摸来摸去，脸上闪着喜悦和幸福的光辉。老年人把眼睛擦了又擦，念出来：“第一汽车制造厂”。长春过去是敌人统治东北的心脏，是敌人坚守的堡垒，长春人民过去受过敌人最残酷的压迫和凌辱。敌人原来在孟家屯培养杀人的细菌；可是今天党领导着人民在那边建起了第一汽车厂，汽车厂是长春和全国人民的希望，当希望化成现实的时候，我们的汽车就在三年里出了厂。
