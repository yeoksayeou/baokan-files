    A Friendship as Close as Brothers
    Li Laicai

    On the occasion of commemorating the 39th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, I especially think of the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and the encouragement I received from the Soviet "Legless Flying General" Alexei Maresiev.

    I am a revolutionary disabled soldier who lost both legs and is now a tractor driver at the Bo'ai Farm in Henan Province. In January 1951, I led a class in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front. We launched three consecutive assaults on a snow-covered mountain three feet thick and persisted for four hours. When the task was finally completed, my feet suffered severe frostbite, and I had to have both legs amputated below the knees. After losing my legs, I was mentally distressed, thinking that "my life is over." Fortunately, the political instructor of the hospital encouraged me with the deeds of the Soviet "Legless Flying General" Alexei Maresiev. I put on a pair of rubber legs, and after practice, I finally stood up. I also learned to drive a tractor and participated in the construction of the motherland. From that moment on, I felt that my current vigorous strength was given to me by the beloved Party and encouraged by the Soviet "Legless Flying General" Maresiev.

    In September of this year, I participated in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' sanatorium delegation to the Soviet Union (organized at the invitation of the Soviet trade unions), to take a short rest in Sochi, a Soviet resort, and then went to Moscow for a visit. During the short period of more than a month, I witnessed the enthusiasm of the Soviet people in building communism and personally experienced the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. Here are just one or two examples to illustrate.

    One day, five of us went to Sochi to visit and wanted to buy a stethoscope, but we were unfamiliar with the road and didn't know where to buy it. We asked an old Soviet lady where we could buy a stethoscope. After looking at us, the old lady asked us if we were Chinese. We said we were Chinese, and she warmly shook hands with us, first telling us where to buy it. Then, fearing that we wouldn't be able to find it, she led us to buy it, accompanying us for several miles, talking as we walked until we bought the stethoscope, and then she said goodbye to us. On another occasion, we took a bus from Sochi to Lake Sumin for a visit, passing through a city (I forgot the name), where we rested for twenty minutes. As soon as our bus stopped, many people surrounded us. After they knew we were Chinese, they all rushed to shake hands with us. Later, a mute ran from a distance to shake hands with us, holding our hands together and waving them high, and kissing our hands with his lips. This was their most affectionate etiquette. Later, he ran to a store to buy a pack of cigarettes and gave it to us. The Soviet people's brotherly friendship towards the Chinese people deeply moved us.

    What I will never forget is the meeting with my good friend Maresiev, whom I had never met before. After we arrived in Moscow, he immediately came to the Leningrad Hotel where we were staying to see me. When I met him, I was so happy! He called out my name familiarly, shook hands and embraced me warmly, and talked to us very excitedly. He was very healthy, and you couldn't tell at all that he had two artificial legs when he walked. We talked for two hours, and he told me about his work, health, and life in recent years. He exercised as usual, and swimming, skiing, skating, dancing, cycling, and driving were all regular sports activities for him. While introducing his life, he also enthusiastically hoped that I would also exercise in these areas in the future. As he spoke, he stood up and pulled me outside to teach me how to walk better. He walked back and forth first, and then watched how I walked. He followed behind, touching my legs with his hands to see what changes there were when walking and whether they were tied tightly. After I walked back and forth twice, he said that my feet were tied a little loosely, which would affect my feet. He also said that as long as a person has a strong will, any difficulties can be overcome. His words further increased my courage. I said that I must learn from his example, continue to exercise, and study technology harder so that I can better serve the socialist construction of the motherland.

    On the occasion of celebrating the 39th anniversary of the Great October Revolution, I sincerely congratulate the Soviet people on achieving even greater success in the cause of building communism. We must steadfastly learn from the Soviet Union and further strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!

    亲如兄弟的友情
    李来财
    在纪念伟大十月社会主义革命三十九周年的日子里，我特别想到中苏两国人民的亲如兄弟的友情和苏联“无脚飞将军”阿历克赛·密烈西叶夫同志对我的鼓舞。
    我是一个失去双脚的革命残废军人，现在在河南省博爱农场当拖拉机手。1951年1月我在朝鲜前线中国人民志愿军中，带领一个班，在三尺厚的雪山上一连打了三次冲锋，坚持了四个钟头，当最后完成任务的时候，我的脚受了严重的冻伤，在不得已的情况下从双膝盖下边锯去了双脚。我在失去双脚以后精神很痛苦，认为“这一辈子就算完了”，多亏医院的教导员同志用苏联“无脚飞将军”阿历克赛·密烈西叶夫同志的事迹鼓舞我。我安上了一双胶皮脚，经过练习以后终于站起来了。还学会开拖拉机，参加祖国的建设事业。从这个时候起，我就感到我今天的蓬勃力量是亲爱的党给我的，是苏联“无脚飞将军”密烈西叶夫同志鼓舞的。
    今年9月间我参加中华全国总工会组织的赴苏休养代表团（这是应苏联工会邀请组织的），到苏联休养胜地索契作短期休养，然后又到莫斯科去参观。在短短的一个多月的时期中，我亲眼看到苏联人民建设共产主义的热情，亲身体会到中苏两国人民亲如兄弟的友情。这里只举出一两个例子就可以看出来。
    有一天，我们五个人到索契城里去参观，想买一个听诊器，可是路不熟，不知道到什么地方去买。我们就问一位苏联老大娘，哪儿有卖听诊器的。老大娘看一看我们以后，就问我们是不是中国人，我们说是中国人，她就亲热地同我们握手，先告诉我们哪儿有卖的，接着他又怕我们找不到，就领我们去买，一直陪我们走了好几里路，一边走一边谈，直到买到听诊器以后她才向我们告别。又有一次，我们坐汽车从索契城到苏民湖去参观，路过一个城市（名字忘了），在那儿休息了二十分钟。当我们的汽车刚一停下，就有很多人围住我们，在他们知道我们是中国人以后，都争着同我们握手。后来又从稍远的地方跑来一个哑叭同我们握手，用两只手握在一起高高举起来向我们挥动，又用嘴亲着我们的手，这是他们的一个最亲热的礼节，后来他又跑到一家商店去买来一盒香烟送给我们。苏联人民对中国人民这种兄弟般的友谊深深地感动着我们。
    最使我难忘的是同我没有见过面的好朋友密烈西叶夫同志的会见。我们到莫斯科以后，他马上到我们住的列宁格勒旅馆来看我。当我同他见面时，心里不知是多么高兴啦！他很熟悉地叫出我的名字，亲热地同我握手、拥抱，非常兴奋地同我们谈话。他的身体很健康，走起路来一点也看不出他是两只假脚。我们谈了两个钟头，他向我介绍了他近几年来的工作情况和身体、生活情况。他照常锻练身体，游泳、滑雪、溜冰、跳舞、骑自行车、开汽车等等都是他经常性的体育活动。在他介绍自己的生活时，他还热情地希望我今后也从这些方面锻练身体。说着他就站起来拉我到屋外教我更好地走路。他先走了一个来回，又看我怎样走，他在后面跟着，用手摸摸我的腿，看看走起来有什么变化，绑的紧不紧。当我走了两个来回以后，他说我的脚绑的有些松，这样就会使我的脚受影响。他还说一个人只要有坚强的意志，什么困难都可以克服。他的话更增加了我的勇气。我说，我一定要学习他的榜样，继续锻练身体，更加努力学习技术，好能更好地为祖国的社会主义建设服务。
    在庆祝伟大十月革命节三十九周年的时候，衷心地祝贺苏联人民在建设共产主义事业中获得更伟大的成就。我们要坚定地向苏联学习，进一步加强中苏两国人民的友谊！
