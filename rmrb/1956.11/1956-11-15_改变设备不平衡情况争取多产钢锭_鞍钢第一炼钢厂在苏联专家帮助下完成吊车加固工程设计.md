    Changing Equipment Imbalance to Strive for More Steel Ingots
    Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steel Plant Completes Crane Reinforcement Engineering Design with the Help of Soviet Experts
    (Our Dispatch) Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steel Plant has completed the design work for reinforcing its existing cranes. According to this design, without requiring much investment, the plant can increase its annual steel production by 400,000 tons, almost equal to the plant's annual output during the puppet Manchukuo period.
    This beneficial measure of utilizing existing equipment is a contribution from Soviet expert Comrade Milehen.
    At Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steel Plant, the open-hearth steelmaking capacity is greater than the lifting capacity of the cranes. Often, the steel is refined, but the furnace cannot be tapped because the crane cannot promptly lift the molten steel ladle; or after the molten steel has been tapped, the iron cannot be lifted and sent into the furnace for steelmaking on time because the crane is too busy, which greatly affects increased production. To solve this problem, relevant personnel at Anshan Iron and Steel have proposed two solutions. One is to replace all the cranes, scrapping the old ones and buying new ones, which requires a large investment and a long time. The other suggestion is more economical, which is to reinforce the existing cranes. However, the original cranes have been in use for decades, and whether they can be reinforced is still a question. In August of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel consulted Soviet crane expert Comrade Milehen. After measurement and calculation, Comrade Milehen affirmed that reinforcement was possible and believed that the load-bearing capacity of each crane could be increased by 40% after reinforcement. Anshan Iron and Steel adopted Comrade Milehen's suggestion and carried out the design under his personal guidance.
    They are now drawing construction blueprints, which are expected to be completed around November 20. The steel plant plans to start the reinforcement project at the end of the year and strive to complete it in the first half of next year.

    改变设备不平衡情况争取多产钢锭
    鞍钢第一炼钢厂在苏联专家帮助下完成吊车加固工程设计
    本报讯　鞍钢第一炼钢厂加固现有吊车的设计工作已完成。根据这个设计，并不需要多少投资，就可以使这个厂今后每年增产四十万吨钢，几乎等于这个厂伪满时期的年产量。
    这一项利用现有设备的有益措施，是苏联专家米列亨同志的贡献。
    在鞍钢第一炼钢厂，平炉炼钢能力大于吊车起重的能力。常常是：钢炼好了，但因吊车不能及时把钢水罐吊来而不能出炉；或者钢水已经出完又因吊车忙不过来不能按时把铁水吊来送进炉内炼钢，大大影响增产。为了解决这一问题，鞍钢有关人员提出过两种方案，一种是全部换装，折旧换新，这既需要很大投资，又需要较长的时间。另一种意见比较经济，是把现有吊车加固。但是原有吊车用了几十年，能否加固，还是个问题。今年8月鞍钢向苏联吊车专家米列亨同志请教。米列亨同志经过测量计算，肯定可以加固，并且认为加固之后每台吊车的载重量可以增加40％。鞍钢采纳了米列亨同志的建议，并在他亲自指导下进行设计。
    现在他们正在绘制施工图纸，预计在11月20日前后可以结束。炼钢厂准备在年底开始加固工程，争取明年上半年完成。
