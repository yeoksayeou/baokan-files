Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The State Council today issued a directive that the compilation and execution of the 1957 national budget should be calculated entirely in new prices, and simultaneously approved the Ministry of Finance's report on this issue.

The Ministry of Finance report stated that, given the confusion in execution, budgetary loopholes, and adverse effects on the economic accounting system of enterprises caused by the 1956 national budget being compiled according to 1955 prices (hereinafter referred to as old prices) but executed according to 1956 prices (hereinafter referred to as new prices), the compilation and execution of the 1957 national budget should be calculated entirely according to new prices. The basic construction investment amount listed in the 1957 national economic plan is calculated according to old prices, merely to facilitate comparison with the First Five-Year Plan, which is necessary. However, the basic construction investment amount calculated according to new prices must also be issued simultaneously, and it must be clearly announced that the basic construction investment amount in new prices is the basis for compiling the 1957 national budget.

The report continued, stating that in the execution of the 1956 national budget, revenue calculated according to new prices reduced the income that should have been reduced; on the expenditure side, because the basic construction plan was compiled according to old prices, and the plan was not changed according to new prices, some departments and localities did not execute it according to new prices. Although the State Construction Commission had stipulated that departments should issue price reduction coefficients to reduce appropriations according to the coefficients, the departments issued them late, and some departments have not issued them to this day; moreover, the issued price reduction coefficients were too low, failing to reduce all the appropriations that should have been reduced; furthermore, the opinions of both parties (Party A and Party B) often differed, and even the low price reduction coefficients could not be implemented smoothly. Some departments even claimed that the original basic construction plan was compiled according to new prices and completely disagreed with converting it according to new prices. Therefore, throughout the year, old and new prices were constantly entangled in basic construction appropriations and project settlements, making it impossible to reach a consensus. During execution, Party B overcalculated funds, turning them into above-plan profits; Party A saved money and arranged additional off-plan projects. By the fourth quarter, the Ministry of Finance calculated that the remaining basic construction appropriations were very few according to new prices; some departments, calculated according to old prices, still requested additional basic construction appropriations. This increased the imbalance in the budget and caused confusion in budget execution. Furthermore, the separation of the budget from the plan constantly caused unnecessary disputes and even affected relationships between departments. This situation should be taken seriously.

The report also stated that the aforementioned budgetary loopholes and execution disputes in 1956, due to the plan being compiled first and the budget being approved later, and also due to a lack of experience, could be said to have been difficult to avoid. In 1957, the plan and budget are compiled simultaneously, and all income and expenditures are calculated according to new prices. As long as the basic construction investment amount for each department is simultaneously issued as a figure calculated according to new prices, and it is clearly announced that the new price is the basis for compiling the plan and budget, the situation that occurred in 1956 can and should be completely avoided.

The State Council issued a directive based on the Ministry of Finance's report. The directive stated that, to facilitate comparison with the First Five-Year Plan, the part of the 1957 national economic plan related to the basic construction investment amount can simultaneously use two figures calculated according to old prices and calculated according to new prices; however, the compilation and execution of the budget should be uniformly based on new prices. The State Council instructed the State Economic Commission to work with the Ministry of Finance and the State Construction Commission to convert the basic construction investment amount in old prices into the basic construction investment amount in new prices, and to be jointly issued by the State Economic Commission and the Ministry of Finance.

### 防止编制和执行投资计划时发生混乱  国务院指示明年预算一律按新价编造

    防止编制和执行投资计划时发生混乱
    国务院指示明年预算一律按新价编造
    新华社27日讯　国务院今天发出了关于1957年国家预算的编制和执行一律以新价为计算单位的指示，并且同时批准了财政部关于这一问题的报告。
    财政部报告说，鉴于1956年国家预算按1955年价格（以下简称旧价）编造，按1956年价格（以下简称新价）执行，曾经引起了执行中的混乱，造成了预算上的漏洞，并且对企业的经济核算制产生了不利的影响。因此，1957年国家预算的编造和执行，都应当一律按新价计算。1957年国民经济计划所列的基本建设投资额，是按旧价计算的，这只是为了便于同第一个五年计划进行比较，这是必要的。但是必须同时下达按新价计算的基本建设投资额，并且明确宣布以新价基本建设投资额为编造1957年国家预算的计算根据。
    报告接着说，在执行1956年国家预算当中，收入方面按新价计算，应当减少的收入都减少了；支出方面由于基本建设计划是按旧价编列的，没有按新价改变计划，因而有些部门和地方就没有按新价执行。虽然国家建设委员会曾经规定要各部门下达降价系数，按系数减少拨款，但是各部门下达得较晚，有的部门至今还没有下达；而且下达的降价系数也偏低，不能把应当减少的拨款都减下来；加以甲乙双方意见常常不一致，即是偏低的降价系数也不能顺利执行，有的部门还说原来编制的基本建设计划就是按新价计算的，根本不同意再按新价折合。因此，一年来在基本建设拨款和工程结算中，旧价新价经常纠缠不清，不能取得一致意见。在执行中，乙方多算了钱，就变成了超计划利润；甲方省下了钱，也另外安排计划以外的工程。到了第四季度，财政部按新价计算，所剩的基本建设拨款已经很少；有些部门按旧价计算，还要求额外增加基本建设拨款。这样，就增加了预算上的不平衡，造成了预算执行中的混乱。而且由于预算与计划脱节，不断引起不必要的纠纷，甚至影响部门之间的关系。这种情况是应当加以重视的。
    报告还说，1956年由于计划编造在先，预算核定在后，又由于缺乏经验，造成上述预算的漏洞和执行中的纠纷，还可以说是难于避免的。1957年计划和预算同时编造，所有收入和支出都是按新价计算的，只要把分部门的基本建设投资额同时下达一个按新价计算的数字，并且明确宣布以新价为编造计划和预算的根据，则1956年发生的那样的情况是可以而且是应当完全避免的。
    国务院根据财政部的报告发出了指示。指示中说，为了便于同第一个五年计划作比较，1957年国民经济计划中有关基本建设投资额的部分，可以同时使用按旧价计算和按新价计算的两个数字；但预算的编制和执行，应当一律统一按新价为准。国务院责成国家经济委员会，会同财政部和国家建设委员会进行关于旧价基本建设投资额折算成为新价基本建设投资额的工作，并且由国家经济委员会和财政部共同下达。
