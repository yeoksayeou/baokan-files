Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 24th: The Presidium Chairman of the Hungarian People's Republic, Dobi, and Secretary Kristof, announced on the 22nd a decree regarding the organization of workers' committees in factories and enterprises.

The decree states that only workers' committees elected by industrial workers can implement leadership over state-owned factories and mines, thereby guaranteeing the realization of socialist democracy.

The decree stipulates that only factories and mines engaged in direct production can elect workers' committees. Workers' committees will not be organized in departments such as government agencies, transportation, and public utilities.

The decree also stipulates that worker committee elections can only be held with the participation of over two-thirds of the workers. Two-thirds of the committee members must be direct production workers.

The decree stipulates that workers' committees have the right to decide on the most important issues in the enterprise and to guide its activities. Workers' committees guarantee the fulfillment of obligations to the state, determine the enterprise's plans, workers' wages, and financial matters within the enterprise.

A separate decree was also announced, stipulating that government representatives will be dispatched to large enterprises with more than two thousand employees, or to enterprises with five hundred employees that are of significant importance to the national economy.

The task of the government representative is to oversee production in the enterprise, ensure that production proceeds without obstruction, and that laws are obeyed. The government representative also arbitrates disputes between the workers' committee and the factory director. With the consent of the workers' committee, the government representative can also appoint the factory director, chief engineer, and chief accountant (however, such appointments must be ultimately approved by the minister).

    法令还规定只有在三分之二以上的工人参加下才能选举工人委员会。委员会中的三分之二委员必须是直接生产的工人。
    法令规定工人委员会得决定企业中的最重要的问题和指导企业的活动。工人委员会保证执行对国家的义务，确定企业的计划、工人的工资以及企业中的财政等问题。
    此间还公布了一项法令，法令规定，将委派政府代表到有两千人以上的大企业或有五百人而对国民经济具有重要意义的企业中去。
    政府代表的任务是照顾企业中的生产，使生产的进行不受阻挠，并且使法律得到遵守。政府代表还裁决工人委员会同厂长之间的争执。在取得工人委员会的同意后，政府代表还能任命厂长、总工程师和总会计师（但是，这种任命最后须由部长批准）。
