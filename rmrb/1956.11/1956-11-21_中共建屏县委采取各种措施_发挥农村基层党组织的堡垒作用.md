Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 20th - The Chinese Communist Party Jianping County Committee, in the autumn production, adopted various measures to correct the deviation of the separation of party and commune and the party not managing the party after agricultural cooperation. Now, the bastion role of rural grassroots party organizations has been strengthened, and some new scenes have appeared in various production tasks.

The foundation of the Jianping County Party was originally good, and it was the core force leading farmers in production and construction. However, since the completion of agricultural cooperation throughout the county this spring, the CCP Jianping County and District Party organizations directly assigned work to the agricultural production cooperatives, neglecting the leadership of rural party organizations. Some county, district, and township cadres also believed that rural cooperation had been achieved, and most of the commune cadres were party members, so when going to the countryside to work, they only looked for agricultural commune cadres and no longer promoted various tasks through the party organization. As a result, some rural party organizations gradually became消沉涣散 (Xiaochen huàn sàn - despondent and lax), and the enthusiasm of most party members could not be brought into play. Various production tasks were also affected because they could not be guaranteed by the party organization. A small number of party member cadres who served in village and commune work began to become arrogant, complacent, and passive due to more use and less education.

Before the autumn harvest this year, the CCP Jianping County Committee, with the help of higher party organizations, examined the above-mentioned deviations and took a series of measures to vigorously correct them. The measures taken were mainly: First, the County Committee included the work of rural grassroots party organizations on the agenda and studied it regularly. County, district, and township party organizations all designated special personnel to manage party affairs. When deploying central tasks, party affairs were also deployed simultaneously. Second, the branch education network was adjusted, and the party class system was restored. Third, party schools were established to train leading backbone members of grassroots party organizations in rotation. Fourth, in conjunction with the central task, more than 50 rural branches that were not sound enough were rectified with emphasis. Fifth, a special meeting was held to study the working methods of rural party branches in the new situation of cooperation.

Through the above work, the消沉局面 (xiāochén jumiàn - despondent situation) of rural grassroots party organizations in Jianping County has begun to reverse. At present, the vast majority of branches have established leadership systems for agricultural communes and mass organizations. Branches that can play a core role in the cooperatives account for 90% of the total number of branches (only about two-thirds in the first half of the year). More than 200 of the county's 320 rural branches have restored the party class system, and the number of branches that adhere to this system better has increased by half compared with the first half of the year.

Now, the vast majority of rural party branches in Jianping County have strengthened their leadership over the production and learning of agricultural commune members. More than 70% of the county's rural party organizations have helped agricultural communes establish political studies. More than 2,000 propagandists, under the leadership of various village branches, have been assigned to production teams and groups to carry out political and current affairs propaganda to commune members who do not have time to study. In addition, the party organizations of more than 200 communes have led commune members to establish clubs, and used recreational activities to conduct ideological education for commune members.

After giving play to the bastion role of rural grassroots party organizations, Jianping County's autumn production this year showed a new scene. Wheat sowing was not only done early and well, but also more fertilizer was applied than in previous years by 30%. Sideline production has also been carried out well. During the autumn harvest, 7,000 laborers were engaged in sideline production, increasing income by 260,000 yuan. Autumn afforestation exceeded the original plan by more than one time. The number of agricultural communes with well-organized consolidation and production in the county has increased by nearly half compared with the first half of the year, and the number of third-class communes with more problems has gradually decreased.

    中共建屏县委采取各种措施
    发挥农村基层党组织的堡垒作用
    据新华社保定20日电　中国共产党建屏县委员会在秋季生产当中，采取各种措施纠正农业合作化后党社不分和党不管党的偏向。现在，农村基层党组织的堡垒作用已经加强，各项生产工作出现了一些新的景象。
    建屏县党的基础原来比较好，是领导农民生产建设的核心力量。但从今年春天完成全县农业合作化以后，中共建屏县、区党组织都是直接向农业生产合作社布置工作，忽视了对农村党组织的领导。部分县、区、乡干部也认为农村合作化了，社干部多数是党员，下乡工作时就只找农业社干部，不再通过党组织来推动各项工作。这样，就使得一些农村党组织逐渐消沉涣散，多数党员的积极性得不到发挥。各项生产任务也因为得不到党组织的保证而受到影响。少数担任村、社工作的党员干部因为使用多教育少，开始骄傲自满、消极疲沓起来。
    今年秋收前，中共建屏县委在上级党组织的帮助下，检查了上述偏向，并采取一系列措施大力纠正。采取的措施主要是：一、县委把农村基层党组织工作列入议事日程，定期研究。县、区、乡党组织都指定专人管理党务工作。部署中心工作时同时部署党务工作。二、调整支部教育网，恢复党课制度。三、开办党校，轮训基层党组织的领导骨干。四、结合中心工作，重点整顿了五十多个不够健全的农村支部。五、召开专门会议，研究了在合作化新形势下农村党支部的工作方法。
    经过上述工作，建屏县农村基层党组织的消沉局面已开始扭转。目前绝大多数支部都建立了对农业社和群众团体等组织的领导制度。在合作社中能起核心作用的支部已占支部总数的90％（上半年只占三分之二左右）。全县三百二十多个农村支部中已有二百多个恢复了党课制度，其中坚持这种制度较好的支部比上半年增加了一半。
    现在，建屏县绝大多数农村党支部都对农业社社员的生产和学习加强了领导。全县70％以上的农村党组织帮助农业社建立了政治学习。两千多名宣传员在各村支部领导下，配备到生产队、组里去，向没有时间学习的社员进行政治与时事宣传。此外，还有二百多个社的党组织领导社员建立了俱乐部，通过文娱活动向社员进行思想教育。
    发挥了农村基层党组织的堡垒作用后，建屏县今年的秋季生产便显示出新的景象，小麦播种不仅种得又早又好，而且肥料比往年多上了十分之三。副业生产也开展的较好，在秋收期间，有七千个劳动力从事副业生产，增加收入二十六万元。秋季造林超过了原订计划一倍多。全县组织巩固、生产较好的农业社，比上半年增加了将近一半，问题较多的三类社也逐渐减少了。
