Xinhua News Agency Report: Shanxi Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau's pasture slope survey team departed from Taiyuan on October 19th to conduct surveys in the Pingxingguan area.

This survey team is the third to conduct fieldwork. Since May of this year, they have already surveyed pasture slopes on mountains such as Heheyan in the Lvliang Mountains and have developed a comprehensive plan for their exploitation and utilization.

This survey team is preparing conditions for the province's plan to raise 15 million sheep and 3 million large livestock within twelve years. They plan to survey the resources of natural pastures in the Taihang Mountains, Lvliang Mountains, and Zhongtiao Mountains over the next four years and develop a development plan.

Shanxi Province has relatively broad pasture resources. Various types of pasture grow in the mountainous areas, which account for 70% of the province's total area. It is expected that the shortage of pasture will gradually improve after planned surveys and development.

    开辟牧草资源
    山西继续勘查牧坡
    据新华社讯　山西畜牧兽医局组织的牧坡勘查工作队，10月19日从太原出发到平型关一带作勘查。
    这个勘查队已经是第三次去作野外勘查工作。今年5月以来，他们已经在吕梁山区的赫赫岩等山头作了牧坡的勘查，并作出了开发利用的全面规划。
    这个勘查工作队是为在十二年内全省喂养一千五百万只羊和三百万头大牲口的计划准备条件的。他们计划在今后四年内查清太行山、吕梁山、中条山等山区的天然牧场的资源，并作出发展规划。
    山西省有较广阔的牧草资源，在占全省总面积70％的山区里，生长着多种多样的牧草，预计经过有计划的勘查和开发以后，牧草缺乏的现象将会逐渐好转。
