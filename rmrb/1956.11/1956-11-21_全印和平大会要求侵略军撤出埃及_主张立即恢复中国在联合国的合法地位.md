Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 20th - A mass meeting of more than 30,000 people was held in Calcutta on the evening of November 18 to celebrate the closing of the All-India Peace Conference. The conference was presided over by Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council.

    A letter from Egyptian President Nasser thanking the Indian people for their support was read out at the mass meeting. Egyptian representative Jalaal spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the people of Asian and African countries are united in their support for Egypt. When he talked about his recent visit to China, he said that he was deeply moved by the upsurge of anger of the Chinese people against the aggression against Egypt.

    Jalaal said: "We are undergoing serious difficulties, but we know that we will win, because I also know that peace-loving people all over the world stand with us."

    Chinese representative Zheng Senyu said that Sino-Indian friendship is a great force for maintaining peace in Asia and Africa. He emphasized that in order to stop imperialist aggression, it is urgently necessary to strengthen unity and cooperation among Asian and African countries.

    Soviet representative Mirza Mir Sharif said that the aggression by Britain, France, and Israel is an attempt by imperialism to further its colonialist expansion in Asian and African countries. He demanded that strong measures be taken to stop this aggression. He reiterated that the Soviet people demand the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Egypt.

    Indian well-known peace advocates Sundarlal and Professor Kosambi, as well as representatives from Britain, Ceylon, Pakistan, and Malaya also spoke at the meeting.

    At the mass meeting, Kitchlew, on behalf of the All-India Peace Conference, handed over a donation of 1,000 rupees to Egyptian representative Jalaal for the relief of refugees who suffered from the air raids in Egypt. The West Bengal Women's Self-Defense League and some Indian poor people also handed over clothing and money to the Egyptian victims at the meeting.

    The All-India Peace Conference, which began on November 15, passed a resolution supporting Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal area and demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Egypt. The All-India Peace Conference condemned the aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel as an unjustified act of aggression against Egypt and other Arab countries, and that this attack constituted a threat to world peace.

    The All-India Peace Conference has established a committee to carry out a campaign to aid Egypt.

    In a resolution, the All-India Peace Conference expressed anxiety about the certain groups of countries and regional military treaties formed in the United Nations organization, and the resolution believed that both are a serious threat to peace. It demanded the immediate restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China as a member state of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council.

    The All-India Peace Conference also passed resolutions demanding that the United Nations immediately and completely ban nuclear weapons, condemning colonialism, calling for unity among Asian and African countries, and promoting friendship between India and Pakistan.
