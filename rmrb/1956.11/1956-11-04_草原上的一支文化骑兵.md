A group of lively herdsmen girls come out with joyous dance steps! As if welcoming their lovers under the moonlight, as if welcoming a happy festival on the bountiful grassland. Joyful dances accompany skilled labor; they are gently caressing their milk cows, squeezing out buckets of snow-white milk. This is the performance of the "Milking Dance" by the Xilingol League Cultural Troupe. Whenever they perform on the grassland, some old herdsmen ladies cannot help but shed tears of joy, going up to look at them closely, caressing them, and asking in surprise: "Are these really our children?"

This cultural troupe is indeed a young and fighting team. They are eighteen people – the youngest being only fifteen or sixteen years old, and the oldest not even thirty – traveling with a cart and a dozen horses, rushing across the Xilingol League grassland day and night, going out in the spring against the wind and sand, and returning in the winter with ice and snow, spending two-thirds of the year on tour performances.

The herdsmen on the grassland, lacking cultural life, are so intoxicated and fascinated by their rich and colorful programs! Their performances deeply infect the audience. Wherever they go, the herdsmen want to learn the songs they sing, and the herdsmen want to copy the poems they recite. Every time they part, some young men and women hold their hands, reluctant to let go; the old people repeatedly urge them: "Good children, don't forget to come again next time!"

On this vast grassland, where have they not been? Which herdsman in the five banners of the entire league does not know this young cultural cavalry? They are like unfading flowers, blooming on the grassland all year round.

I saw their performance at the Xilinhot People's Club. Over two consecutive evenings, they performed dozens of programs, including dramas, songs and dances, poetry recitations, and Mongolian storytelling. It was truly all-encompassing, and each type of program had lively and vivid original works from their own real lives. At one evening party, nearly a hundred people came and went on stage. People who didn't know would have thought it was a large and powerful theater troupe. In reality, the lighting, scenery, orchestra, and performance, from backstage to front stage, were all carried out by these eighteen people in tense activity, and the work was organized in an orderly manner, with the programs proceeding one after another. An actor often wore two or three sets of clothes according to the order of the program. He took off one set after the curtain call, and before he could even wipe the sweat, he quickly ran out again.

This cultural troupe has been established for eight years. In the middle, the name was changed several times, and personnel were transferred, but they have always maintained their fine tradition: a hard-working and simple fighting style, and wholeheartedly serving the Mongolian people. They have lived among the herdsmen for a long time, and works that express the new life of the herdsmen have gradually emerged. They once rode fast horses with the herdsmen to hunt wolves on the grassland. What an exciting scene that was! At the beginning, a large group of people carefully searched in the weeds, as tense and excited as reconnaissance soldiers. Once a wolf was discovered, the hunters' hearts burned like a raging fire. People shouted and attacked wildly, the grassland shook like ten thousand horses galloping, but the formation was not chaotic, there was command, there was organization, unified action, internal and external cooperation, until the evil wolf was killed. They experienced the tense battle and the joy of victory with the herdsmen. From here, they experienced the herdsmen's hatred for the evil wolves, their determination to protect their happy life, and their strong character and heroic behavior. Based on this, they created their own "Wolf Hunting Dance." Although, due to the limitations of artistic cultivation, they cannot yet perform this program perfectly, they will succeed as long as they continue to process and create tirelessly.

Several young authors have emerged from the cultural troupe, one of whom is Oerdengge, from a herdsman family. When he joined the cultural troupe five years ago, he regarded creation as an incomprehensible and mysterious thing. Later, he learned musical notation and staff, recorded folk songs by himself, read famous poems, and gradually became familiar with several art forms. In the lives of the people, many moving images deeply touched him, so he boldly tried to create. Through continuous hard work, he finally wrote works that were welcomed by the masses. The song "The Sentry Girl," the poem "Spring Work," and the storytelling poem "Mutual Aid and Cooperation is Good" won awards at the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's literary and artistic performance conference last year. The lyrics he wrote, "Young Commune Members," participated in the National Music Week performance after being set to music.

The cultural troupe also has Han youth who wholeheartedly serve ethnic minorities. That capable young man, Gao Tai, has really developed a full set of skills in recent years. He can sing, dance, use several instruments, and can both create and direct. He is in almost every show of an evening performance. In the group, he is loved by his comrades; among the herdsmen, he enjoys honor. Gao Tai was very uneasy when he first came here. He couldn't ride a horse when traveling on the vast grassland; he wasn't used to eating mutton and dairy products when he lived in herdsmen's homes; and he couldn't communicate because he didn't know the language when he wanted to get close to the masses. He was deeply distressed!

Of course, there were many reasons that prompted him to work with peace of mind: the education of the Youth League, the help of his comrades, and he did not forget what the league's leaders said: Comrades who come to work on the grassland from the outside need to have the spirit of the "Volunteer Army." But what moved him the most was the love he received from the herdsmen everywhere. The herdsmen knew he was a Han, so they especially respected him. When everyone drank tea, they always gave him the first bowl; the old ladies felt sorry for him when he couldn't eat, so they made noodles for him separately. He still remembers that the first Mongolian sentence the old herdsman lady taught him was "Sain khu, chi sain khu!" – "Good child, you are a good child!"

The love of the herdsmen and his own ardent pursuit of artistic life gave him the strength and determination to overcome difficulties. Things that he was not used to gradually became habitual. He also slowly learned Mongolian. He even gave himself a Mongolian name, truly like a Mongolian child. Indeed, isn't it the most pleasant and happy thing for a Han youth to wholeheartedly serve ethnic minorities, help them, learn from them, and dedicate his whole heart to this ethnic group?

    草原上的一支文化骑兵
    林沫
    一群活泼的牧民姑娘，迈着欢乐的舞步出来了！像是在月光下迎接自己的爱人，像是在丰收的草原上迎接幸福的节日。欢乐的舞蹈伴随着熟练的劳动，她们是在轻轻地抚摸着自己的乳牛，挤下一桶桶雪白的牛奶。——这是锡林郭勒盟文工团在演出他们的“挤奶舞”。每当他们在草原上演出之后，一些牧民老太太就不免闪烁着快乐的眼泪，上去仔细地看他们，抚摸他们，惊奇地问着：“这就是我们那班孩子吗？”
    这个文工团实在是一支年轻的、战斗的队伍。他们十八个人——年纪小的不过十五、六岁，最大的也不到三十岁，带着一辆马车和十几匹马，终日奔驰在锡林郭勒盟大草原上，春天迎着风沙出去，冬天带着冰雪归来，一年有三分之二的时间是在奔走演出。
    缺乏文化生活的草原牧民，看到他们丰富多彩的节目，是怎样的如醉如迷呵！他们的表演深深感染了观众，走到处，他们唱的歌，牧民要学；他们朗诵的诗，牧民要抄。每次临别的时候，一些青年男女，拉着他们的手，恋恋不舍；老年人都一再嘱咐着：“好孩子，别忘记下次再来呵！”
    在这千里纵横的草原上，哪里他们没有到过呢？全盟五个旗的牧民，有谁不知道这支年青的文化骑兵呢？他们就像不败的花朵，一年四季在草原上开放。
    我看他们的演出，是在锡林浩特的人民俱乐部。接连两个晚会，共演出了几十个节目，话剧、歌舞、朗诵诗、蒙古说书，真是应有尽有，而且每类节目里，都有生动活泼的、来自现实生活的他们自己的创作。一个晚会，在舞台上有近百人进进出出。不知道的人会以为这是一个力量雄厚的大剧团。实际上，灯光、布景、乐队、演出，从后台到前台全部就是十八个人在紧张地活动，而且工作组织得有条不紊，节目一个紧接一个进行。一个演员，常是按着节目进行的次序，穿着两三套衣服，闭幕回去脱下一套，汗都顾不得擦，就赶紧又跑出来。
    这个文工团成立已经八年了。中间几次改换名称，调换人员，但他们一直保持着自己的优良传统：艰苦朴素的战斗作风，忠心为蒙古族人民服务。他们长期生活在牧民中间，表现牧民新的生活的作品就逐渐出现了。他们曾经骑着快马，跟牧民在草原上追捕野狼。这是一个多么激动人心的场面呵！开始，大队人马在荒草中细心地搜索着，像侦察兵一样人人紧张而兴奋。一发现狼，猎人的心像烈火一样燃烧了，人们高呼，狂袭，草原上惊天动地，犹如万马奔腾，但阵容不乱，有指挥，有组织，统一行动，里外配合，直到把恶狼打死。他们和牧民一起经历了紧张的战斗和胜利的欢快。从这里，他们体验到了牧民对恶狼的仇恨，保卫幸福生活的决心以及他们坚强的性格和英雄行为。在这个基础上，他们创作了自己的“打狼舞”。虽然，由于艺术修养的限制，目前他们还不能把这个节目表演得十分完美，但只要不懈地进行加工创造，他们是会成功的。
    文工团已经出现了几个青年作者，来自牧民家庭的鄂尔登格就是其中的一个。五年前他参加文工团时，把创作看成不可理解的神秘的事物。以后他学会了音乐简谱和五线谱，自己记录民歌，阅读名诗，逐渐熟悉了几种艺术形式，在人民的生活中，许多动人的形象深深感动了他，于是他就大胆地尝试创作。在不断地刻苦努力中，他终于写出了受群众欢迎的作品。歌曲“放哨的姑娘”，朗诵诗“春天的工作”和说唱诗“互助合作好”，曾在去年内蒙古自治区的文艺会演大会上得到了作品奖。他写的歌词“年青的社员”在配曲后，曾参加了全国音乐周的演出。
    文工团也有忠心为少数民族服务的汉族青年。那个能干的小伙子高太，这几年真是练出了全套本事，他能歌，善舞，会用好几样乐器，既搞创作，又能导演；演出一个晚会，几乎场场都有他。在团里面，他得到同志们的爱戴；在牧民中，他享有荣誉。高太初来到这里很不安心。在辽阔的大草原上行动，他不会骑马；在牧民家里住下来，他不习惯吃羊肉和奶食；要接近群众，却语言不通。他深深地苦恼了！
    促使他安心工作的，当然有很多原因，青年团的教育，同志们的帮助，他也没有忘记盟的领导同志讲的话：外边到草地来工作的同志，需要有“志愿军”的精神。但最使他动心的，还是到处受到牧民的热爱。牧民知道他是汉人，就特别敬重他，大家喝茶的时候，常是把第一碗先端给他；老太太见他吃不下饭，就心疼他，另外给他作面吃。他还记得，牧民老太太教给他的头一句蒙古话就是“赛音胡，其赛音胡！”——“好孩子，你是好孩子！”
    牧民的热爱和自己对艺术生活的热烈追求，给了他克服困难的力量和决心。不习惯的事情也渐渐习惯了。蒙古话也慢慢学会了。他还给自己起了蒙古名字，真像是一个蒙古孩子了。的确，一个汉族青年，忠心耿耿地为少数民族服务，帮助他们，又跟他们学习，把全身心献给这个民族，难道不是最愉快和幸福的吗？
