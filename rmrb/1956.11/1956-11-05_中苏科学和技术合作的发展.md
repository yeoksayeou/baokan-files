The Development of Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation
    Zhang Ye

Scientific and technological cooperation is one of the important means of economic cooperation between socialist countries. This cooperation is carried out on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs. It promotes the development of the national economy of each country, first and foremost, the development of heavy industry, and the common upsurge of the entire socialist world economic system, and guarantees the victory of the socialist world economic system in the peaceful economic competition with the capitalist system.

Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, our country has conducted extensive scientific and technological cooperation with various socialist countries, among which the Soviet Union occupies the most important position and plays the greatest role.

Learning from the Soviet Union is our unswerving policy. In the early days of the People's Republic of China, China and the Soviet Union cooperated in science and technology, and experts from the two countries conducted extensive contacts. During the period of national economic recovery, our country signed many contracts for technical materials and drawings with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union provided our country with many valuable technical materials and drawings and sent a large number of experts to China to impart their experience, giving our country scientific and technological assistance in all aspects, enabling our country to quickly complete the task of restoring the national economy.

In 1953, our country began to implement the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. The scale of construction expanded day by day, and the need for science and technology also increased day by day. This required more comprehensive scientific and technological cooperation with fraternal countries, especially with the Soviet Union. Therefore, on October 12, 1954, the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement was signed. The agreement stipulated that scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries should be realized through the exchange of experience in various sectors of the national economy, mutual supply of technical materials, exchange of relevant information, and dispatch of experts to provide technical assistance and introduce the scientific and technological achievements of the two countries. The technical materials supplied by both parties to each other are provided free of charge, and only the actual expenses required for copying the copies of the materials are paid. A Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee, composed of seven representatives from each side, was also established to formulate measures for realizing cooperation and to facilitate the submission of appropriate recommendations to the two governments. This committee has held four meetings and adopted many resolutions on further expanding scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries. The fifth meeting will be held in Moscow in November this year.

Over the past seven years, Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation has developed and expanded day by day. The Soviet Union has provided comprehensive and selfless assistance to the engineering of 211 newly built and rebuilt industrial enterprises in our country, from the selection of factory sites, the collection of basic design data, the determination of the enterprise's design task book, the design, the supply of equipment, the guidance of construction and safe operation to the manufacture of new products, the free provision of technical information for the manufacture of new products, and the training of personnel to master new technologies, and has sent a large number of experts to China to participate in construction and accepted a large number of Chinese interns to practice in the Soviet Union. These 211 important industrial enterprises are the center of industrial construction in my country's First Five-Year Plan and the solid foundation of my country's socialist industrialization. Now many important enterprises have been put into production, such as many workshops of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and machine tool manufacturing plants, Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Beijing Electron Tube Factory, as well as a chemical factory, several power stations and many other enterprises.

Mutual supply of design technical data for industrial construction occupies a very important position in Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation. The Soviet Union has supplied our country with technical data for the construction of coal mines, concentrators, non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises, power stations, locomotive and vehicle manufacturing, oil plants, glass factories, locomotive and vehicle repair plants, transformer factories, reinforced concrete structure factories, and railway building construction designs. Due to the application of Soviet technical documents, China's industry has mastered the production of elevators, excavators, drilling machines, "Donbass" coal mining combines, turbo generators, bridge cranes, motors, transformers, automobiles, electron tubes and other machines and equipment. Before 1956, our country will arrange the production of nearly 100 kinds of the latest machine tools according to Soviet technical documents. My country's supply of technical materials to the Soviet Union has also gradually increased with the development of my country's economy, including technical materials for silk weaving, pulp, paper, reinforced concrete poles for transmission lines, prefabricated reinforced concrete, water conservancy construction, the use of tung oil to make drying oil, meat, vegetable, and fruit cans, certain chemical products and pharmaceutical products.

According to the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement, the Soviet Union supplied China with design drawings of more than 600 factories, workshops, transportation, and cultural and living units, and more than 1,700 sets of drawings for the production of machinery, equipment, and devices, including mining cranes, ore loaders, drilling equipment, metal cutting machine tools, blast furnace and beneficiation equipment, compressors, electric shovels, water turbines, water pumps, locomotives, and other working drawings of various machines and equipment, enabling China's industry to master the production of the above-mentioned machinery and equipment. The Soviet Union also provided China with 300 kinds of production process instructions, including film equipment, various vacuum instruments, production of high-quality steel, steel, paints, pigments, varnishes, aluminum alloys, asbestos cement products, and chemical products, as well as production materials related to industry, agriculture, transportation, and hygiene. China supplied the Soviet Union with manufacturing drawings of certain equipment for the coal mining and metallurgical industries, instructions and drawings for medical devices, process instructions and samples of various light industrial and local industrial products, as well as traditional Chinese medicine treatment experience, pharmaceutical prescriptions and samples, sericulture and tussah silkworm breeding experience, research on fish migration and information on treating certain fish diseases. China also supplied the Soviet Union with a large number of samples and seeds of agricultural crops, as well as seedlings of oil and volatile oil crops and seeds of woody shrubs.

Mutual reception of experts to conduct inspections and exchange experiences in various aspects of industry and agriculture is also an important form of Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation. The Soviet Union has successively sent experts and delegations to China to inspect the cultivation experience and achievements of crops, the possibilities of China's experience in fighting severe infectious diseases, research work in water conservancy construction, medicine, physiology, biochemistry, astronomy, etc., and to study China's acupuncture therapy, etc. China has also successively sent experts and delegations to the Soviet Union to inspect the experience and achievements of metallurgy, coal, petroleum, textile, construction, and other departments. The fourth meeting of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee, held in June 1956, decided to expand this exchange of expert inspection work. Relevant Soviet departments will receive Chinese experts to inspect the experience and scientific and technological achievements in ferrous metallurgy, non-ferrous metallurgy, power, construction, machine tool manufacturing, and agriculture. Relevant Chinese departments will also receive Soviet experts to inspect bridge construction, silk industry, long-fiber paper production, fish farming experience, and other scientific and technological achievements. The first meeting of the scientific and technological exchange conference on the construction and reconstruction of irrigation systems, decided at this meeting, was held in Beijing in mid-to-late October this year. The meeting exchanged experiences in the construction, reconstruction, design, construction, and irrigation management of irrigation systems. In the future, experience exchange meetings for various experts will be held separately. When China held the National Congress of Advanced Producers in April and May this year, the Soviet Union sent delegations of advanced producers from various fields such as steel, machinery manufacturing, construction, coal mining, non-ferrous metals, chemical industry, transportation, agriculture, and forestry to China to impart advanced technical experience to Chinese workers.

The joint scientific expedition conducted by Soviet experts and Chinese experts has been of great help to our country. The large oil fields of Karamay in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the large amount of oil and various minerals in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai were discovered by Chinese geologists with the help of Soviet geologists. The comprehensive biological expedition team organized by Chinese and Soviet biologists to carry out the work of excavating biological resources in Yunnan has also achieved great results. In terms of animals, 60 species of mammals, 240 species of birds, and more than 2,000 species of insects have been discovered, many of which are animals never recorded in China. In terms of plants, more than 70 new records and more than 10 new species have been discovered, and 124 species of plants with economic value have been investigated, and a large number of specimens have been made.

On August 18 this year, China and the Soviet Union signed an agreement on the joint investigation and comprehensive utilization of natural resources in the Heilongjiang River basin. According to this agreement, China and the Soviet Union will jointly investigate and study the natural resources and the prospects for the development of productive forces in the Heilongjiang River basin bordering the two countries, and prepare a comprehensive utilization plan for the Ergun River and the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River, and carry out survey and design work, so that the Heilongjiang River can serve the people of China and the Soviet Union. The Sino-Soviet joint scientific expedition team for the Heilongjiang River basin began the survey and scientific investigation work in the Heilongjiang River basin from mid-June, and it has now come to an end. This year's work has achieved great results.

The Soviet Union's scientific and technological assistance to China's nuclear physics research and peaceful utilization of atomic energy is of great significance. On January 17, 1955, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union proposed that the Soviet Union provide China with scientific, technical, and industrial assistance in promoting research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. In April, an agreement was signed, stipulating that an atomic reactor with a heat output of 6,500 kilowatts to 10,000 kilowatts and a cyclotron that enables particles to obtain energy of 12.5 million to 25 million electron volts be established for Chinese scientists. The Soviet Union also trains scientific workers and engineers for China in nuclear physics, radiochemistry, the application of isotopes in science and technology, and atomic pile technology.

The fourth meeting of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee, held in Beijing in June this year, adopted many resolutions on further expanding scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries, among which the most important is to establish direct links between the Academies of Sciences and scientific research institutions of China and the Soviet Union through methods such as mutual dispatch of scientific research personnel, exchange of scientific works, and joint conduct of various thematic scientific research work.

The role of Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation in China's socialist transformation and socialist construction is multifaceted. Through this cooperation, not only can the technical difficulties in our country's economic construction be solved and the quality of construction projects and products be improved, it is possible to accelerate our country's socialist industrialization with less manpower and financial resources, but also can cultivate and strengthen our country's scientific and technological forces, so that our country's scientific and technological level can be rapidly improved.

Now, we are working hard to complete and overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and are actively preparing for the Second Five-Year Plan. In the Second Five-Year Plan, we will continue to carry out industrial construction centered on heavy industry, promote the technical transformation of the national economy, and establish a solid foundation for China's socialist industrialization. The main requirement of China's socialist industrialization is to basically build a complete industrial system in about three five-year plan periods. This requires continuing to expand our country's scientific and technological cooperation with socialist countries, especially with the Soviet Union, in order to rapidly improve our country's scientific and technological level and strive to approach the world's advanced level in many important scientific and technological sectors during the Third Five-Year Plan period to meet the requirements of our country's socialist construction for science and technology.

    中苏科学和技术合作的发展
    章叶
    科学和技术合作是社会主义国家经济合作的重要方式之一，这种合作是在平等、互利和不干涉内政的基础上进行的。它促进每一个国家的国民经济的发展首先促进重工业的发展和整个社会主义世界经济体系的共同高涨，并保证社会主义世界经济体系在同资本主义体系和平经济竞赛中取得胜利。
    自从中华人民共和国建立以来，我国同各社会主义国家进行了广泛的科学和技术合作，其中苏联占着最重要的地位并起着最大的作用。
    学习苏联是我国坚定不移的方针。在中华人民共和国成立初期，中苏两国就在科学和技术方面进行合作，两国专家进行广泛的接触。在国民经济恢复时期，我国同苏联签订了许多技术资料、图纸合同，苏联提供我国很多珍贵的技术资料、图纸，并且派了大批专家来我国传授经验，从各方面给我国以科学和技术援助，使我国迅速完成恢复国民经济的任务。
    1953年我国开始执行发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，建设规模日益扩大，对科学和技术的需要也日益增多，这就需要同各兄弟国家，特别是同苏联进行更全面的科学和技术合作，于是在1954年10月12日签订了中苏科学技术合作协定。协定规定两国通过交流国民经济各部门的经验来实现两国间的科学技术合作，互相供应技术资料，交换有关情报，并派遣专家，以进行技术援助和介绍两国在科学技术方面的成就。双方互相供应的技术资料不付代价，仅支付用于复制各项资料的副本所需要的实际费用。还由双方各派代表七人组成中苏科学技术合作委员会，以制定实现合作事宜的措施和便于向双方政府提出适当的建议。这个委员会已经开了四次会议，通过了很多有关进一步扩大两国科学技术合作的决议。第五次会议将在今年11月在莫斯科举行。
    七年来，中苏科学和技术合作日益发展和扩大。苏联对我国新建和改建的二百一十一项工业企业的工程从选择厂址、搜集设计基础资料、确定企业的设计任务书、进行设计、供应设备、指导建筑安全运转一直到新产品的制造，无偿地供给制造新产品的技术资料、培养掌握新技术的人材等等，都从头到尾地给以全面无私的援助，并派大批专家来我国参加建设和接受我国大批实习生到苏联去实习。这二百一十一项重要的工业企业是我国第一个五年计划工业建设的中心，也是我国社会主义工业化的坚实基础，现在已经有许多重要企业投入了生产，如鞍山钢铁公司和机床制造厂的许多车间、哈尔滨量具刃具厂、长春第一汽车制造厂、北京电子管厂、此外还有一个化学工厂，若干发电站和许多别的企业。
    互相供应工业建设方面的设计技术资料在中苏科学技术合作中占有很大的地位。苏联对我国供应了建设煤矿、选矿厂、有色冶金企业、电站、机车和车辆制造、石油厂、玻璃厂、机车和车辆修理厂、变压器厂、钢筋混凝土结构厂、铁路建筑物建设设计等技术资料。由于运用苏联的技术文件使我国工业掌握了升降机、挖掘机、钻探机、“顿巴斯”采煤联合机、涡轮发电机、桥式起重机、电机、变压器、汽车、电子管及其他机器和设备的生产。在1956年以前我国将根据苏联的技术文件安排好近一百种最新式机床的生产。我国对苏联的技术资料的供应，也随着我国经济的发展而逐渐增加，其中包括丝织、纸浆、纸张、输电线的钢筋混凝土支柱、装配式钢筋混凝土、水利建设、用桐油制造干性油、肉类、蔬菜、水果罐头、某些化学制品和医药制品的技术资料。
    根据中苏科学技术合作协定，苏联供给我国六百多种工厂、车间、运输及文化生活单位的设计图纸和一千七百多套生产机器设备和装置的图样，其中包括矿山起重机、矿石装载机、钻探装置、金属切削机床、高炉和选矿设备、压缩机、电铲、水轮机、水泵、机车以及其他各种机器和设备的工作图纸，使我国工业能够掌握了上述机器设备的生产。苏联还供给我国三百种生产工艺说明书，其中包括电影设备、各种真空仪表、生产优质钢、钢材、油漆、颜料、磁漆、铝合金、石棉水泥制品和化学产品等生产工艺说明书以及有关工农业、运输业和卫生等方面的生产资料。我国则供应苏联有关煤矿工业和冶金工业某些设备的制造图纸、医学器械的说明和图纸、各种轻工业及地方工业产品的工艺说明和样品以及中医医疗经验、药剂配方和样品、桑蚕和柞蚕的养殖经验、鱼类洄游的研究和医治某些鱼类疾病的资料。我国还供给苏联大量农作物的样品和种子及油料、挥发油料作物苗木及木本灌木植物种子。
    互相接待专家考察和交流工农业各方面的经验，也是中苏科学技术合作的一个重要形式。苏联曾先后派遣专家和代表团来我国考察农作物的栽培经验和成就，我国同烈性传染病进行斗争的经验的可能，水利建设、医药、生理、生物化学、天文等方面的研究工作，学习我国的针灸疗法等等。我国也先后派遣专家和代表团到苏联考察冶金、煤炭、石油、纺织、建筑和建设等部门的经验和成就。中苏科学技术合作委员会在1956年6月举行的第四次会议，决定扩大这种互派专家的考察工作。苏联有关部门将接待我国专家考察黑色冶金、有色冶金、动力、建筑、机床制造和农业方面的经验及科学技术成就。我国有关部门也将接待苏联专家考察桥梁建筑、丝绸工业、长纤维纸的生产、养鱼经验和其它科学技术成就。这次会议决定召开的灌溉系统新建、改建科学技术交流会议第一次会议，已经在今年10月中下旬在北京举行，会议曾就灌溉系统新建、改建、设计、施工和灌溉管理等方面交流了经验。今后将分别举行各种专家的经验交流会议。今年四五月间我国举行全国先进生产者代表会议的时候，苏联曾派钢铁、机器制造、建筑、煤矿，有色金属、化学工业、交通运输、农业、森林等各方面的先进生产者代表团前来我国，到各地向中国工人传授先进技术经验。
    苏联专家和我国专家共同进行科学考察，对我国的帮助很大。新疆维吾尔自治区克拉玛依大油田和青海柴达木盆地的大量石油和各种矿藏就是我国地质学家在苏联地质学家的帮助下发现的。中苏两国生物学家组织的综合生物考察队在云南进行发掘生物资源的工作，也获得很大成绩，在动物方面，发现了兽类六十种，鸟类二百四十种，昆虫二千种以上，其中有很多是国内从未记载过的动物，在植物方面发现了七十多个新纪录，十多个新种，调查了有经济价值的植物一百二十四种，制作了大量的标本。
    今年8月18日中苏两国签订了一项由中国和苏联共同调查和综合利用黑龙江流域自然资源的协定，根据这个协定中苏两国将共同调查和研究两国交界处黑龙江流域的自然资源和生产力发展的远景，并编制额尔古纳河和黑龙江上游综合利用规划，进行勘测设计工作，以使黑龙江为中苏两国人民服务。由中苏两国科学家组成的黑龙江流域科学综合考察队从6月中旬起开始了黑龙江流域的勘测和科学考察工作，现在已经告一段落，今年的工作收到很大成绩。
    苏联对我国核子物理学研究和原子能和平利用方面的科学技术援助具有非常重大的意义。1955年1月17日苏联部长会议提出苏联在促进原子能和平用途的研究方面给予中国以科学、技术和工业上的帮助的建议，4月间签订了协定，规定为我国的科学家建立一座发热量为六千五百瓩到一万瓩的原子反应堆，和一个使粒子获得一千二百五十万到二千五百万电子伏特的能量的回旋加速器。苏联并为我国培养核子物理学方面、放射化学方面、把同位素用于科学技术方面和原子堆技术方面的科学工作人员和工程师。
    今年6月在北京举行的中苏科学技术合作委员会第四届会议通过了许多有关进一步扩大两国科学和技术合作的决议，其中特别重要的是通过相互派遣科学工作人员、交换科学著作、共同进行各种专题科学研究工作等办法来建立中苏两国科学院和科学研究机关之间的直接联系。
    中苏科学技术合作对我国的社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的作用是多方面的。通过这个合作不但解决我国经济建设中的技术困难，提高建设工程和产品的质量，有可能用较少的人力和资力来加速我国的社会主义工业化，而且可以培养和壮大我国的科学技术力量，使我国的科学技术水平得到迅速提高。
    现在，我们正在紧张地为提前并超额完成第一个五年计划而努力，并且积极地准备第二个五年计划。在第二个五年计划中我们要继续进行以重工业为中心的工业建设，推进国民经济的技术改造，建立我国社会主义工业化的巩固基础。我国社会主义工业化的主要要求是在大约三个五年计划时期内基本上建成一个完整的工业体系。这就需要继续扩大我国同社会主义国家，特别是同苏联的科学和技术合作，以便迅速提高我国科学技术水平，争取在第三个五年计划期间在许多重要的科学和技术部门接近世界上的先进水平，满足我国社会主义建设事业对科学和技术的要求。
