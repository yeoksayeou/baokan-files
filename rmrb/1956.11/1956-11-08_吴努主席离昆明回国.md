Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 7th – Chairman U Nu of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma and his entourage left Kunming by plane at 1:15 PM today to return home. Before boarding the plane, he repeatedly shook hands with those who came to see him off and expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese government and people for their warm reception.

The Burmese Ambassador to China, U Hla Maung, also accompanied U Nu back to his country.

Chairman U Nu, accompanied by Yao Zhongming, the Chinese Ambassador to Burma, and U Hla Maung, the Burmese Ambassador to China, arrived in Kunming at 12:00 noon today. At Kunming Airport, Chairman U Nu, accompanied by Liu Minghui, Vice Governor of Yunnan Province, Pan Shuoduan, Mayor of Kunming, and officials from the Burmese and Vietnamese consulates in Kunming, had lunch and addressed the more than 3,000 people from all ethnic groups and walks of life who came to welcome him despite the rain. He said, "After we arrived in Beijing, we discussed the Sino-Burmese border issue and many other important issues with the leaders of the Chinese people. During the discussions, we saw that the leaders of the Chinese people treated us like brothers, with a very fair and reasonable attitude."

He said, "As we are building the Sino-Burmese friendship edifice, we must point out that it is not enough for only the leaders of China and Burma to build such a friendship edifice. It must be built not only by the leaders but also by the people below—the people of China and Burma—together, so that this friendship edifice can be built." He pointed out that Yunnan Province is the province in China closest to Burma, and therefore, Yunnan Province plays the most important role in building the Sino-Burmese friendship edifice. Chairman U Nu also said: Now, the leaders of the Chinese people and the leaders of the Burmese people have resolved to build and consolidate the Sino-Burmese friendship edifice. He called on the people of China and Burma to work together to build this friendship edifice. His speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the welcomers.
