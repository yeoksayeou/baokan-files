Mangaldas Pakwasa, the former Governor of Bombay Province, who presided over the conference, said at the meeting: "Sun Yat-sen was the greatest revolutionary in Asia." He said that his "Three Principles of the People must be implemented in all countries." He ridiculed some countries' attempts to exclude China from the United Nations, saying, "Ignoring China is tantamount to ignoring three-quarters of Asia."

Ru. K. Karanjia, President of the Bombay Branch of the India-China Friendship Association, said in his opening remarks: "For those of us in India, Sun Yat-sen's teachings are of great significance."

Pu. Er. Lailer, Vice President of the Bombay Branch of the India-China Friendship Association, spoke about the revolutionary changes that have taken place in India and China since Sun Yat-sen's birth. He said that the events in New China after the Second World War have completely realized Sun Yat-sen's ideals.

Wei Yongqing, the Chinese Consul in Bombay, briefly described Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary struggles and the teachings he gave to the Chinese people.

The West Bengal Provincial Branch of the India-China Friendship Association held a commemoration meeting for Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday in Calcutta. The Speaker of the West Bengal Provincial Assembly, Mukherjee, presided over the meeting. Overseas Chinese in Delhi and Bombay also held commemoration meetings.

Burma

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, November 12th: On the eve of the 90th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, Burmese newspapers in Rangoon published articles or congratulatory messages written by Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe, Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Chairman U Nu, and prominent figures from all walks of life in Burma to commemorate Sun Yat-sen. On the same afternoon, overseas Chinese and people from all walks of life in Burma held a commemoration meeting at the City Hall Auditorium.

Burmese Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Shan State Government, Zaw Khun Cho, said in his article that the people of the Union of Burma, including all states and districts, respect the patriotic leader of China, Sun Yat-sen. He said that Sun Yat-sen's ideals have been realized. Today, an independent, free, and great China stands in the world. He firmly believes that Sun Yat-sen will always be the immortal patriotic leader of great China.

U Tun Win, Minister of Commodity Distribution and Cooperatives, expressed his respect for Sun Yat-sen's political views and high patriotic spirit in his article. He said that Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and his reputation not only continue to spread throughout Southeast Asia but also far across the world.

Burmese political elder and peace elder, Tekin Ko Toe Mai, pointed out in his article that Sun Yat-sen was the founder of the Kuomintang. He implemented anti-imperialist and anti-feudal policies and advocated alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers. Before his death in 1925, Sun Yat-sen pointed out the influence of the October Socialist Revolution on China. Tekin Ko Toe Mai pointed out that the right wing of the Kuomintang abandoned these three major policies, but the Chinese Communist Party implemented his propositions.

Aung San's wife, Du Qingzhi, said in her short essay "Remembering Forever" that Sun Yat-sen's selfless and noble efforts to liberate China and the Chinese people will not only forever exist in the memory of the Chinese people but also forever exist in the memory of the Asian people.

Former Minister of Propaganda and Editor-in-Chief of "Tun Pao," U Tun Pe, said that Burmese politicians drew political insights from Sun Yat-sen, and the Burmese people published the Burmese translation of "Three Principles of the People." U Tun Pe said that although Sun Yat-sen was a Christian, I learned from Sun Yat-sen that religious belief and patriotic political belief are unconstrained.

U Yang Na, the head of the Burmese film delegation who visited China in April and May this year, said that Sun Yat-sen once firmly advocated cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party. Many Kuomintang members who were loyal to Mr. Sun Yat-sen, following his correct propositions, have become close comrades-in-arms of the Communist Party. As someone who witnessed the progress of New China, U Yang Na appealed to the members of the Chinese Kuomintang in Taiwan: adhere to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's correct propositions and participate in the peaceful and progressive construction of New China.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, November 12th: Overseas Chinese in Burma held a meeting at the Rangoon City Hall on the afternoon of November 11th to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth.

Among the 1,000 overseas Chinese who participated in the conference, some were old members of the Tongmenghui and old members of the Kuomintang.

Li Liyin, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Burma, and staff members of the Chinese Embassy also participated in the conference.

The conference was chaired by Chen Zhanmei. In his speech, he emphasized that the best way to commemorate the great figure Sun Yat-sen is to learn from his patriotic spirit. He said that the goals and ideals that Mr. Sun Yat-sen had dreamed of and fought for for forty years have now been realized by the Chinese people. He encouraged overseas Chinese to love their motherland.

He also said that the democratic cause that Sun Yat-sen failed to complete has been realized by the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese people. The Mongolian people commemorate Sun Yat-sen with joy.

Vietnam

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 13th: The preparatory committee, chaired by Bui Ji, President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, announced that Hanoi and Haiphong will hold meetings on November 16th and 17th respectively to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth.

Hanoi newspapers published articles today and yesterday commemorating the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth.

The Vietnamese "People's Daily" said in an article entitled "Sun Yat-sen, the Great Democratic Revolutionist of China" that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life was devoted to the volunteer of national liberation and the realization of democracy in China. Today, the entire Chinese people cherish Mr. Sun Yat-sen's merits, precisely because he set an example of being loyal and courageously fighting to the end to achieve this goal.

The famous Vietnamese historian and Vice President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, Chen Huiliao, published an article in the "New Yuehua Daily" describing Sun Yat-sen's influence on the Vietnamese revolution and the mutual help and support between Chinese and Vietnamese revolutionaries.

Vietnam was once one of Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary activity bases. From 1907 to 1908, Sun Yat-sen went to Vietnam, set up a revolutionary command organization in Hanoi, and personally led the military attack on the then Zhennanguan. During this period, Mr. Sun Yat-sen had contact with some Vietnamese patriots in the Vietnamese "Dongyou Movement" and "Tokyo Nghia Thuc Movement" and received their sympathy and support. At the request of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Vietnamese revolutionary Huang Hua Tan once sheltered 3,000 revolutionary troops withdrawn from China in An Shi, Bac Giang Province, where he led the uprising, for more than two months in 1907. When the Vietnamese revolutionary leader Phan Boi Chau went to Japan in 1905, the first person he met, introduced by Inukai Tsuyoshi, was Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

When Sun Yat-sen was promoting the revolution in Haiphong in 1908, he was wanted by the French colonists. Thanks to the help of local overseas Chinese, he escaped danger many times. Today's "New Yuehua Daily" reported the situation of the late Haiphong overseas Chinese Zhong Nianzu secretly sheltering Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary activities and published photos of the loft where Sun Yat-sen lived in the Zhong family and the mirror and inkstone used by Sun Yat-sen in the loft that have been preserved to this day.

"New Yuehua Daily" also published articles and recollections written by many overseas Chinese who participated in Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary activities fifty years ago.

Japan

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 12th: Old friends of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and overseas Chinese in Japan held a meeting in Tokyo this afternoon to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth.

More than one hundred people, including famous figures from society such as Miyazaki Tatsusuke, Yamada Junzaburo, Kita Reikichi, Isogai Rensuke, Katayama Tetsu, Hirano Yoshitaro, and Hosokawa Karoku, and overseas Chinese in Tokyo, participated in the meeting.

With the unanimous approval of all participants, the commemorative meeting sent a congratulatory message to the commemorative meeting of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's 90th birthday in Beijing and established a "Sun Yat-sen Association Preparatory Committee" headed by Miyazaki Tatsusuke and Imasato Juntaro.
