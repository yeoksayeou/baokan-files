    Ominous Signs

    The Anglo-French invasion of Egypt has only been underway for a few days, but quite a few "uncommon in recent years" events have already occurred in Britain.

    Here are a few examples.

    On November 1st, the British House of Commons debated the government's policy of armed aggression against Egypt. Labour Party members furiously shouted "Resign," "Shameful," "Fascists," and "War Criminals" at Eden and other government leaders. The shouting was so intense that the House of Commons had to adjourn for half an hour. It is said that this was the first time the parliament had adjourned due to such circumstances since 1923.

    On November 2nd, after chaotic disputes, the British House of Commons was finally forced to agree to hold a special meeting on the 3rd (Saturday). It is said that this was the first time the parliament had met on a Saturday since 1949.

    On November 4th, 50,000 London citizens held a mass rally in Trafalgar Square to oppose the government's aggression against Egypt. After the rally, about 10,000 people poured into Whitehall, intending to go to 10 Downing Street, where the British Cabinet was holding a meeting. While occupying Whitehall, police and protesters clashed around 4:30 PM. It wasn't until 6:00 PM that the police cleared the road from Whitehall to Parliament Square and Trafalgar Square. It is said that this was the biggest and most violent clash in Whitehall in the past twenty years.

    These events illustrate the truth that the people, not only in other countries but also in Britain, are extremely angry about the aggression against Egypt, and they firmly oppose this unjust war. And for the British ruling clique, which insists on taking a desperate gamble in Egypt, these "uncommon in recent years" events are an "ominous sign." If they do not turn back early, then the tragic consequences that befall them will probably also be "uncommon in recent years."

    不吉之兆
    英法对埃及发动侵略战争只不过才几天，可是在英国却已经发生了不少“多年以来所少见”的事情。
    不妨举几个例子。
    11月1日，英国下院就政府的武装侵略埃及的政策进行辩论。工党议员们愤怒地向艾登和其他政府领袖大叫“辞职”、“可耻”、“法西斯分子”、“战争罪犯”。叫嚷声如此剧烈，以致下院的会议不得不休会半小时。据说，这是自从1923年以来议会第一次因这种情况而休会。
    11月2日，英国下院在经过了混乱的争吵后，政府终于被迫同意下院在3日（星期六）举行特别会议。据说，自从1949年以来，议会是第一次在星期六举行会议。
    11月4日，伦敦五万市民在特拉法加广场举行了反对政府侵略埃及的群众大会。大会结束后，约一万名群众涌进白厅大道，打算到英国内阁正在那里举行会议的唐宁街十号去。在占领白厅大道的时候，警察和群众在下午四时三十分左右发生冲突。直到下午六时，警察才打通了从白厅大道到议会广场和特拉法加广场的道路。据说，这是白厅大道二十年来最大最猛烈的一次冲突。
    这些事情说明了一条真理，那就是不仅其他国家的而且也包括英国在内的人民群众，对侵略埃及的行动是愤恨异常的，他们坚决反对这种非正义的战争。而对于坚持要在埃及进行孤注一掷的冒险行动的英国统治集团来说，这些“多年以来所少见”的事情就是一种“不吉之兆”。他们如果还不及早回头，那么落在他们头上的悲惨后果，恐怕也会是“多年以来所少见”的。（翁）
