  Tubeless Car Tires
    The Shanghai Great China Rubber Factory recently successfully trial-produced a type of tubeless car tire.
    This tire has airtight properties. The inside of the tire, as well as the place where it joins the rim, has a layer of rubber to insulate the air. It does not have the disadvantage of ordinary tires being prone to bursting due to friction between the inner and outer tubes. It can also save rubber and simplify the production process during manufacturing.
    The first batch of twelve tires were installed on several jeeps and sedans. After test runs on bumpy roads or smooth avenues, the tires did not leak or become damaged. One of the tires continued to run for nearly a week after being punctured by a nail. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Weeding Tool for Paddy Fields
    A mechanically powered weeder suitable for weeding in paddy fields in the south has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory. According to the results of on-site tests, this mechanically powered weeder is a very good and convenient tool for removing weeds from paddy fields. The entire machine weighs 127 jin (approximately 63.5 kg). One person can weed 30 mu (2 hectares) per day, which is 15 to 20 times faster than manual labor. The weed removal rate between rice seedlings reaches 70% to 80%.
    The technical personnel of the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory began researching and designing the mechanically powered weeder in the spring of last year. They investigated the weeding tools used by farmers in more than 20 counties, integrated the advantages of these tools, and finally succeeded after four preliminary trials and revisions.

    Machine for Clean Air
    The "Two-Stage Cotton Gin Dust Filter", which can ensure that textile workers breathe clean air, has been manufactured in Tianjin.
    In the past, cotton mills generally used exhaust fans to discharge large amounts of air containing lint and dust, and bring in clean air from the outside. This caused large fluctuations in temperature and humidity in the workshop, which often affected the quality of cotton yarn. With the "Two-Stage Cotton Gin Dust Filter", the air in the workshop can be filtered and reused, which is not only of great benefit to the health of workers, but also ensures the quality of cotton yarn.
    The "Two-Stage Cotton Gin Dust Filter" was jointly designed by Lu Shijie, director of the cotton gin workshop of the state-owned Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, and Gao Weirong, an engineer from the Tianjin Textile Bureau. (Xinhua News Agency)

  没有内胎的汽车轮胎
    上海大中华橡胶一厂最近试制成功了一种没有内胎的汽车轮胎。
    这种轮胎具有密闭气体的性能，轮胎的内部以及它和网圈接合的地方，都有一层用以隔绝空气的橡胶。它没有普通轮胎因内外胎磨擦而易于爆破的缺点，在制造的时候还可以节省橡胶，简化生产过程。
    第一批生产的十二只轮胎，分别装在几辆吉普车和小轿车上，经过在颠簸不平的道路或平坦的大道上试跑，轮胎没有发生漏气和损坏的情况。其中一只轮胎被钉子戳破以后，还继续行驶了将近一个星期。（新华社）
    水田除草的工具
    一种适于南方水田中除草用的机力耘禾器，最近在江西省农业机械修配厂试制成功。经实地试验结果，这种机力耘禾器是铲除水田杂草的很好的轻便工具，全部机身重一百二十七市斤，一人掌握每天能耘禾三十亩，比人工快十五到二十倍；禾苗行间除草净度达70％到80％。
    江西省农业机械修配厂的技术人员研究和设计机力耘禾器是去年春季开始的。他们曾经调查了二十多个县的农民使用的耘禾器具，综合了这些器具的优点，经过四次初试和修改最后终于成功。

    干净空气的机器
    能够保证纺织工人吸到干净空气的“清花两级式滤尘器”，已经在天津制造出来。
    过去，棉纺织厂一般都采用排风器把大量含有飞花、尘土的空气排出去，把外面干净的空气换进来，这样车间里温湿度波动大，常常影响棉纱质量。有了“清花两级式滤尘器”，车间的空气滤干净了可以回用，这样既对工人健康有很大好处，也可以保证棉纱质量。
    “清花两级式滤尘器”是国营天津第六棉纺织厂清花车间主任卢士杰和天津纺织管理局工程师高维荣共同设计的。（新华社）
