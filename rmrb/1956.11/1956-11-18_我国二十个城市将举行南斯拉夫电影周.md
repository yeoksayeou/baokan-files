    我国二十个城市将举行南斯拉夫电影周
    据新华社17日讯　11月29日是南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的国庆日。为庆祝这个节日，文化部决定自29日起在二十个城市分两批举行“南斯拉夫电影周”，放映“当机立断”、“他俩”、“旧恨新仇”和“小勇士历险记”等四部故事影片。电影周期间，南斯拉夫电影工作者将派代表团来我国进行友好访问。
    “当机立断”和“他俩”都是以南斯拉夫人民反抗法西斯德寇侵略的斗争为背景的。“旧恨新仇”描写一个大资本家遗弃了他的情人，又企图夺取儿子的爱人的故事，揭露了资产阶级的丑恶面貌。“小勇士历险记”描写一个名叫凯凯茨的孩子用他的机智和勇敢战胜一个暴徒的经过。
    将要举行这个电影周的城市是北京、天津、上海、沈阳、哈尔滨、武汉、广州、成都、西安、乌鲁木齐、太原、济南、南京、杭州、鞍山、长春、长沙、福州、兰州和呼和浩特。
