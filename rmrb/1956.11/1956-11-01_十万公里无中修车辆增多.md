The automobile drivers of the Lanzhou Transportation Company, after launching the "Safety, Economy, 100,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul" campaign, have continuously achieved new successes. By the end of September, eight state-owned vehicles had exceeded the 100,000 kilometers without major overhaul record. At the same time, fifteen vehicles had reached over 90,000 kilometers without major overhaul, and nearly twenty vehicles had reached over 80,000 kilometers without major overhaul. This is the result of their learning from the advanced Soviet experience in vehicle maintenance.
