An Investigation into the "Five Guarantees" Work of Thirty-Nine Advanced Cooperatives

In July of this year, the Rural Relief Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs sent a working group to thirty-nine advanced agricultural cooperatives in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Jiangxi to conduct investigations and research on the issues of "who to guarantee," "how to guarantee," and "how much to guarantee" in the "Five Guarantees" work.

These thirty-nine advanced agricultural cooperatives, when they were still primary cooperatives last year, provided subsidies to elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled members with livelihood difficulties to meet their minimum living needs. Since the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program, these agricultural cooperatives have promptly implemented the "Five Guarantees" policy. According to statistics from seventeen of these agricultural cooperatives, the income of the "Five Guarantees" households, accounting for 1.8% (nine hundred and ninety-nine people) of the total number of members, has increased compared to the past, and their living conditions have improved to a certain extent. Liu Zhitian and his wife, who are blind in both eyes in Shuangyan Village, Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, cultivated five mu of land last year, earning only eleven dan of grain and two hundred and fifty jin of wheat, equivalent to one hundred and eight yuan, with an actual income of seventy-six yuan after deducting costs. This year, the agricultural cooperative made appropriate arrangements for them in production, and they can work more than one hundred workdays this year, with an income of up to one hundred and fifty yuan. Sun Yuesheng and his wife, who have completely lost their labor ability in Xiangshan Agricultural Cooperative, Tongshan County, originally had two and a half mu of land. Now the cooperative subsidizes them with one hundred and five yuan, an increase of more than fifty-one yuan compared to last year's actual income. The "Five Guarantees" households who have received care are very grateful to the Communist Party and the agricultural production cooperative.

After the implementation of the "Five Guarantees," not only has the livelihood of the "Five Guarantees" households been guaranteed, but the burden on the government and society has also been reduced. For example, among the thirty-two elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled people in the Second Cooperative of Songdu Township, Yixing County, thirteen households relied on mutual assistance from the masses and government relief in 1955, with a total of four hundred and twenty-five yuan in mutual assistance and relief funds. Now, only eight households among these thirty-two households need a subsidy of three hundred and fifty-four yuan, seventy-one yuan less than in 1955. At the same time, since many orphaned and widowed households have participated in auxiliary labor, a portion of the main labor force has been freed up to participate in the basic construction of the agricultural cooperative, increasing the cooperative's income.

Who Should Be Guaranteed

These agricultural cooperatives generally determine the scope and targets of the "Five Guarantees" based on Article 3 of the National Agricultural Development Program and Article 53 of the Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives. Appropriate care has been given to members who lack labor or have completely lost their labor ability, as well as elderly, weak, disabled, orphaned, and widowed members who have no means of support. As for impoverished households with many people and little labor, or those whose main labor force is sick and whose income is not enough to maintain the entire family, they are generally not included in the "Five Guarantees" scope. They divide the "Five Guarantees" households into three categories based on different labor conditions: those who cannot participate in labor at all, and whose living expenses are fully covered by the agricultural cooperative; those who have some labor ability but cannot fully support themselves, and the cooperative subsidizes a portion; and those with relatively poor labor ability, who can support themselves after being taken care of in production. A few cooperatives only divide into two categories, excluding the last category mentioned above. According to statistics from seventeen cooperatives, those who need full guarantees account for one-third of the "Five Guarantees" households, and those who need partial subsidies account for two-thirds. Some individual cooperatives have also included some impoverished members with many people and little labor as "Five Guarantees" objects, thereby increasing the burden on the cooperative. Among the "Five Guarantees" households determined by Jiashan Agricultural Cooperative in Dongbai Township, Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, only eighteen households (twenty-one people) truly deserved it; while there were thirty-five households (one hundred and fifty-five people) with little labor, many people, heavy burdens, and difficulties in production and life.

How to Guarantee, How Much to Guarantee

The living standards and guaranteed items of the "Five Guarantees" households are mainly determined based on actual living needs and the economic strength of the cooperative. Most cooperatives set the living standards for "Five Guarantees" households slightly lower than the living standards of general members, while a few cooperatives determine them with reference to the living standards of general members or according to the local rural unified purchase and sale retention (rice, oil, salt, cloth, etc.) standards. Most cooperatives guarantee all five items (food, clothing, fuel, education, and burial); cooperatives with better economic conditions have achieved seven or eight guarantees, including medical treatment, housing, and pocket money; cooperatives with poorer economic conditions only guarantee food or two or three items from fuel and clothing. According to the average calculation of these agricultural cooperatives, the annual living standard for each "Five Guarantees" household is: food - four hundred and seventy jin of grain; fuel - one thousand five hundred and forty jin of firewood; clothing - one set of clothes, equivalent to eight yuan and two jiao; education - in addition to exemption from tuition fees, a subsidy of five yuan, three jiao and six fen for school fees; burial - thirty-three yuan; pocket money - twelve yuan and eight jiao; medical care - some cooperatives stipulate that free medical care is limited to no more than five yuan per person; housing - the cooperative is responsible for repairing houses. The total annual living expenses per person are equivalent to sixty-four yuan. However, in reality, most subsidies are given for what is lacking, and the actual amount of subsidies does not reach this standard. Only a few individual cooperatives provide care for "Five Guarantees" households that exceeds the living standards of general members, with the highest averaging one hundred and nine yuan per person per year.

Some cooperatives calculate the "Five Guarantees" standard in terms of workdays: one method is to first calculate the average number of workdays per person per year in the entire cooperative, and then stipulate the number of workdays to subsidize the "Five Guarantees" households according to a standard slightly lower than the living standards of general members. Xiangshan Agricultural Cooperative in Tongshan County, Jiangsu Province, had an average of eighty-six point nine workdays per person per year (with a value of one yuan, one jiao and one fen per workday), and the "Five Guarantees" standard was set at seventy workdays. Another method is to calculate the necessary living expenses and convert them into workdays as the "Five Guarantees" standard. The Second Agricultural Cooperative of Songdu Township, Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, first calculated that the food, clothing, oil, salt, matches, kerosene, etc. for each person totaled fifty-six yuan and four jiao, and then converted it at a rate of one yuan and five jiao per workday, totaling thirty-seven point six workdays; in addition, two point four workdays were used as flexible expenses, totaling forty workdays to be subsidized per person.

With workdays as the standard, the living standards of "Five Guarantees" households can be improved with increased production; however, if the cooperative suffers from disaster and reduces production, their living standards will also be reduced accordingly. In order to maintain the minimum living needs of "Five Guarantees" households, some cooperatives stipulate that the "Five Guarantees" standard should not be lower than forty-five yuan, and if the value of the subsidized workdays is less than forty-five yuan, the difference will be made up by the cooperative. Using cash and in-kind as the standard is relatively fixed and cannot be changed with increased or decreased production. Some cooperatives stipulate that the "Five Guarantees" standard will not change without major increases or decreases in production. That is to say, with major increases in production or disasters, this relatively fixed standard still needs to be changed.

Judging from these situations, the "Five Guarantees" burden of these agricultural cooperatives is not heavy. According to statistics from eleven agricultural cooperatives, the "Five Guarantees" expenses account for 0.33% of the total income and 11.24% of the public welfare fund. The "Five Guarantees" expenditure of Sugongdi Cooperative in Hanshou County, Hunan Province, is the largest, accounting for 83.9% of the public welfare fund; the smallest expenditure is Shanghua Cooperative in Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, accounting for 3.13% of the public welfare fund. From the situation in general areas, it is feasible to use the public welfare fund to bear the "Five Guarantees" expenses. On average, each member of the seventeen agricultural cooperatives bears six jiao and seven fen of "Five Guarantees" expenses. Three cooperatives bear an average of more than one yuan to one yuan and three jiao; the remaining fourteen cooperatives bear less than one yuan, with the least averaging only one jiao and five fen per person.

How to Arrange the Production of "Five Guarantees" Households

Arranging the production for "Five Guarantees" households is an indispensable aspect of the "Five Guarantees" work. Agricultural cooperatives have great production potential due to the implementation of collective management. As long as they are deeply explored, each cooperative has many jobs suitable for elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled members. Wang Haiping Cooperative in Hanshou County has a total of one hundred and thirty-four types of agricultural work throughout the year, of which fifty-seven types can be done by elderly and orphaned members; there are a total of twenty types of diversified operations, requiring two hundred and fifteen people, of which the elderly and orphaned members can do the pig raising, sheep herding, and watching the drying ground, which can accommodate forty-five people. As long as attention is paid to arranging them, they can solve part or all of their livelihood problems through production.

These cooperatives combine the overall production plan and labor plan of the cooperative, rank the light work in the agricultural and sideline production of each season in the entire cooperative, and then plan the types of work, number of days, and income they can do according to the physical strength and skills of the "Five Guarantees" households. Generally, cooperative cadres believe that the work plans for "Five Guarantees" households should be realistic, and should not be too high or too low. If it is too high, the "Five Guarantees" households will not be able to complete the work plan, increasing their difficulties; if it is too low, it will cause waste to the cooperative. Some cooperative cadres believe that the advanced cooperative has just been established, and in the case of many types of work and more detailed and complex organization and division of labor, the division of labor and industry cannot be fully planned in a thorough and precise manner. Therefore, when calculating how many workdays the elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled can do, it is better to estimate less.

In the production process, each cooperative also paid attention to implementing the spirit of giving priority to the elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled households, and tried their best to let them do light and nearby work. In order to ensure the realization of the production plan of the elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled households, Wang Haiping Agricultural Cooperative also prepared to implement a "Five Guarantees" responsibility system in each production team, contracting out the amount of money needed to subsidize the "Five Guarantees" households and the planned number of workdays to each production team. If the production team fails to complete the plan, and the subsidy for the "Five Guarantees" households needs to be increased, the team will be responsible for the subsidy.

After the work plan is determined, each cooperative adheres to the principle of "more work, more pay, less work, no subsidy." Except for work delays due to illness or other objective reasons, the work plan will not be changed. No less subsidy will be given for increased income due to active labor; no more subsidy will be given for reduced income due to lazy labor. Due to the implementation of this method, the enthusiasm of the "Five Guarantees" households has been greatly improved. Wang Arong, a "Five Guarantees" household in Xiangxi Agricultural Cooperative, Xindeng County, was unwilling to work before the work plan was determined. He only worked nine and a half workdays in more than two months, which was more than twenty workdays less than members with the same labor force; later, due to the cooperative's evaluation of the work plan and implementation of "more work, more pay," he changed his original labor attitude and actively participated in production. In the first twenty-one days of implementing this method, he worked eleven and a half workdays.

Taking Care of Daily Life

For "Five Guarantees" households who are old and weak, completely unable to work, or young and unable to take care of themselves, in addition to providing funds or in-kind subsidies, each cooperative also provides labor assistance for their daily life. The methods adopted by each cooperative are basically four types: one is to mobilize members to voluntarily help with work, such as fetching water, cooking, washing clothes, and chopping firewood. One is for the cooperative to bear the "Five Guarantees" expenses and entrust members to take care of their lives. One is for the cooperative to provide labor to take care of the lives of "Five Guarantees" households, such as the Red Star Cooperative in Shangyou County, Jiangxi Province, which organizes service teams and designates special personnel to fetch water, chop firewood, grow vegetables, and take care of daily life for these households. The members who provide these services are appropriately compensated with work points according to their work quality and quantity. One is for the cooperative to provide centralized care. For example, Nanlin Cooperative in Qilin Township, Poyang County, Jiangxi Province, brought together fifteen elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled members who had difficulty moving, unable to carry water, or cook, and lived together to help each other. They were given rations, oil, salt, and firewood at a standard of one jiao per person per day, which was provided by the cooperative, and the cooperative helped to make clothes, and they grew their own vegetables.

    三十九个高级社“五保”工作的调查
    今年7月间，内务部农村救济司派出了一个工作组，在江苏、浙江、湖南、江西四个省的三十九个高级农业合作社中，对“五保”工作中“保什么人”“如何保”“保多少”的问题进行了调查研究。
    这三十九个高级农业合作社，早在去年还是初级社的时候，对于生活有困难的老弱孤寡残疾社员就给予了最低生活需要的补助。自全国农业发展纲要公布后，这些农业合作社都及时地执行了“五保”政策。据其中十七个农业社统计：占总社员人数1.8％（九百九十九人）的“五保”户，收入都比以前有了增加，生活也有了一定程度的改善。江苏省宜兴县双眼失明的刘志田夫妇，去年种五亩田，只收入十一石谷、二百五十斤麦子，折合一百零八元钱，除去成本，实际收入七十六元。今年农业社在生产上对他们作了适当安排，今年可做一百多个劳动日，收入可达一百五十元。铜山县象山农业社完全丧失了劳动力的孙月胜老俩口，原有二亩半田，现在合作社补助他俩一百零五元，比去年实际收入增加五十一元多。受到照顾的“五保”户，对共产党和农业生产合作社非常感激。
    实行“五保”后，不但“五保”户的生活有了保障，而且减轻了政府和社会的负担。如宜兴县宋渎乡二社的三十二户老弱孤寡残疾的人1955年依靠群众互助和政府救济的有十三户，互助和救济款共四百二十五元。现在，这三十二户中只有八户需要补助三百五十四元，比1955年少七十一元。同时，由于很多孤寡户都参加了辅助劳动，从而腾出一部分主要劳力参加了农业社的基本建设，为合作社增加了收入。
      应该保什么人
    这些农业合作社对于“五保”范围和对象的确定，一般都是根据全国农业发展纲要第三条和高级农业生产合作社示范章程第五十三条的规定进行的。对于缺乏劳动力或完全丧失劳动力，以及生活没有依靠的老弱残疾孤寡的社员，都给予了适当的照顾。至于人多劳力少，或者是主要劳力患病，收入不够维持全家生活的贫困户，一般不划在“五保”范围内。他们对于“五保”户又根据不同的劳动条件分了三类：完全不能参加劳动，生活费用全部由农业社包下来的；有一点劳动力，生活不能全部自给，合作社补助一部分的；劳动力较差，在生产上给以照顾后，可以自给的。也有少数合作社只分两类，不包括上述三类中的最后一类。据十七个社统计：“五保”户中需要全保的占三分之一，需要部分补助的占三分之二。也有个别合作社将一些人多劳力少的贫困社员也列为“五保”对象，因此，增加了合作社的负担。浙江省诸暨县东白乡佳山农业社确定的“五保”户中，真正应得的只有十八户（二十一个人）；而劳力少、人口多、负担重、生产、生活上有困难的户就有三十五户（一百五十五人）。
    怎样保、保多少
    “五保”户的生活标准和所保的项目，主要是根据实际生活需要和合作社的经济力量决定的。大部分合作社对“五保”户的生活标准定的比一般社员的生活水平稍低，少数合作社是参照一般社员生活水平或按照当地农村统购统销留量（米、油、盐、布等）标准确定的。补助的项目，大部分合作社是五样（吃、穿、烧、教、葬）全保；经济条件较好的合作社做到了七保或八保，连医病、住房和零用钱都保下来了；经济条件较差的合作社，只保吃或是烧、穿中的两、三项。据这些农业社平均计算，“五保”户每个人全年的生活标准是：吃——四百七十斤粮食；烧——一千五百四十斤柴草；穿——一套衣服，折款八元二角；教——除免交学费外，并补助学费五元三角六；葬——三十三元；零用——十二元八角；医药——有的合作社规定，免费医疗以每人不超过五元为限；住——由合作社负责修缮房屋。合计每人全年的生活费相当于六十四元。但是，实际上多是缺什么补什么，真正补助的数量并没有达到这个标准。只有个别的合作社，对“五保”户的照顾超过了一般社员的生活水平，最高的平均每人全年达一百零九元。
    还有些合作社的“五保”标准是以劳动日计算的：一种是先计算出全社全年每人的平均劳动日，然后按照稍低于一般社员生活水平的标准，规定出补助“五保”户的劳动日数。江苏省铜山县象山农业社，全社平均每人全年得八十六点九个劳动日（每个劳动日的工值为一元一角一），“五保”标准定为七十个劳动日。另一种是计算出必需的生活费用，折成劳动日，作为“五保”的标准。江苏宜兴县宋渎乡第二农业社，先计算出每个人的口粮，衣、油、盐、火柴，煤油等共为五十六元四角，再按每个劳动日为一元五角折算，共折合三十七点六个劳动日；另外以二点四个劳动日作为机动费用，共计每人需补助四十个劳动日。
    以劳动日为标准，“五保”户的生活水平可以随生产提高而提高；但是，如果社内遭灾减产，他们的生活水平也会随之降低。为了维持“五保”户的最低限度的生活需要，有的合作社规定：“五保”标准最低不能低于四十五元，若补助的劳动日工值不足四十五元，差额由社里另行补足。以现款、实物为标准是比较固定的，不能随产量的提高或降低而变动。有的合作社规定：没有大的增产和减产不变动“五保”标准。也就是说，有了大的增产或灾情，这个比较固定的标准也还是需要变动的。
    就这些情况来看：这些农业社的“五保”负担并不重。据十一个农业社统计：“五保”费用占总收入的0.33％，占公益金的11.24％。湖南省汉寿县粟公堤社的“五保”开支最大，占公益金的83.9％；开支最少的为浙江省兰溪县上华社，占公益金的3.13％。从一般地区的情况来看，以公益金负担“五保”费用是可行的。十七个农业社平均每个社员负担“五保”费用六角七分。平均负担一元以上至一元三角的三个社；其余十四个社负担都在一元以下，最少的每人平均仅负担一角五分。
    如何安排“五保”
        户的生产
    对“五保”户在生产上予以安排，是“五保”工作中不可缺少的一个方面。农业社由于实行了集体经营，生产潜力很大，只要深入发掘，每个合作社都有很多适于老弱孤寡残疾社员做的活。汉寿县王海坪社全年的农业工共有一百三十四种，其中孤老社员可以做的有五十七种；多种经营共有二十种，需要二百一十五人，其中孤老社员可以做的，仅养猪、牧羊、看晒谷场等项即可容纳四十五人。只要注意安排他们，就可以通过生产解决一部或全部生活问题。
    这些合作社结合全社生产规划和劳动规划，将全社各个季节的农、副业生产中的轻活进行排队，然后根据“五保”户的体力和技术，计划出他们能做的工种、日数和收入。一般社干部认为：确定“五保”户的出工计划应实事求是，不宜偏高偏低，偏高则“五保”户出工计划不能完成，增加他们的困难；偏低则造成社的浪费。有的社干部认为：高级社刚建立，在工种繁多，组织分工更加细致复杂的情况下，分工分业还不能完全做到计划周密、精确，因此计算老弱孤寡残疾能做多少劳动日，宁可少些。
    在生产过程中，各个社还注意贯彻执行了优先照顾老弱孤寡残疾户的精神，将轻工、近工尽量让他们去做。为了保证老弱孤寡残疾户生产计划的实现，王海坪农业社还准备在各生产队实行“五保”责任制，将“五保”户所需补助的钱数和计划出工数全部包给各生产队，如果生产队完不成计划，“五保”户的补助款需要增加时，则由各队负责补助。
    出工计划确定后，各社都坚持“多劳多得，少劳不补”的原则。除由于患病误工或其他客观原因外，出工计划不再变动。凡因劳动积极，收入增多，也不少补助；如劳动怠惰、收入减少，也不多补助。由于实行了这种办法，“五保”户的积极性大大提高。新登县湘溪农业社，“五保”户王阿荣，未确定出工计划的时候，不愿劳动，两个多月只做九个半劳动日，比同等劳动力的社员少做了二十多个劳动日；后来由于社内评定了出工计划，实行“多劳多得”，使他改变了原来的劳动态度，积极地参加了生产。在开始实行这种办法的头二十一天中，就做了十一个半劳动日。
      照顾日常生活
    对于年老体弱完全丧失劳动能力，或年幼不能照管自己生活的“五保”户，各社除予以资金或实物补助外，并对他们的日常生活予以劳力协助。各社所采取的办法基本上有四种：一种是发动社员自愿帮工，如挑水、做饭、洗衣、砍柴等。一种是由社负担“五保”费用，委托社员照顾生活。一种是由社出工照顾“五保”户的生活，如江西省上犹县红星社组织服务小组，指定专人替这些户挑水、砍柴、种菜及日常生活照顾。对这些服务的社员，按照他们的工作质量、数量适当补给工分。一种是由社集中包养。如江西省鄱阳县其林乡南林社，将行动不便、不能担水、做饭的老弱孤寡残疾社员十五人集中起来居住，互相帮助、按每人每日一角钱的标准发给口粮、油、盐、柴由社供给，衣服由社帮助做，蔬菜由他们自种。
