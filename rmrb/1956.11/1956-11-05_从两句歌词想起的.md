Thoughts Inspired by Two Lines of Lyrics
　　Wang Yinghuan
　　In the autumn of 1945, in order to sincerely seek domestic peace, the Chinese Communist Party, after negotiating with the Kuomintang, signed the "Double Tenth Agreement." A week later, the New Fourth Army fulfilled its promise and withdrew northward from bases such as southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui. Before leaving, countless people reluctantly bid farewell to their own soldiers, and our soldiers, with extremely heavy hearts, bid farewell to their beloved elders. They sang a song to the KMT soldiers, which included these two lines: "If you have a problem with us, don't harm the common people!" Countless people were moved to tears listening to the song. (See "A Brief History of the Chinese People's Liberation War," Xinhua Bookstore edition.)
　　Reading this historical account, I couldn't help but be moved by this great emotion. These two ordinary sentences contain such profound ideological content! It should be said that this is true poetry.
　　These two lines of lyrics are the heartfelt words of the people's soldiers based on deep class feelings, and therefore have great emotional persuasiveness.
　　Here, I thought of a common, yet often overlooked issue by some people: First there is emotion, then there is poetry; the deeper the emotion, the more likely it is to write good poetry. As long as the poet has the ability to infect the reader with the emotional fluctuations they have felt, then even without "silvery" or "azure" kinds of flowery and insubstantial adjectives, but only a few simple sentences, even sentences that seem unremarkable in isolation, are fully qualified to become good poetry.
　　As a reader, I rarely experience the heart-shaking excitement I mentioned earlier when reading poems published in newspapers and magazines. I think this must be because some poems still lack the most indispensable genuine and profound emotion.
　　One more thing: such songs should be said to have some historical significance. It is a pity that we cannot see the whole picture. If it were not for the "Brief History of the People's Liberation War" mentioning it, it would probably be completely lost in obscurity. Wouldn't it be a very meaningful thing for our musicians to collect, organize, and publish such works?

    从两句歌词想起的
    王英桓
    1945年秋天，中国共产党为了真诚谋求国内和平，在和国民党谈判以后，签订了“双十协定”；一周以后，新四军就履行诺言，从苏南、皖南等根据地北撤。临行时，万千百姓依依不舍地送别着子弟兵，我们的战士们怀着万分难过的心情告别了亲爱的父老。他们对蒋军士兵唱着一支歌，其中有这样两句：“倘和我们过不去，不要伤害老百姓！”无数的人听着歌子，感动得泣不成声。（见“中国人民解放战争简史”，新华书店版）
    我读着这段历史，也不禁被这种伟大的感情所感动。这两句平凡的话，蕴含着多么深刻的思想内容！应该说，这是真正的诗。
    这两句歌词，是人民战士在深厚的阶级感情的基础上吐露的心声，因而具有很大的感情上的说服力。
    这里，想到了一个普通的、然而常为一些人所忽视的问题：先有了感情，然后有诗；感情愈深，愈有可能写出好诗。只要诗人有本事把自己所感受到的感情上的波动让读者也感染到，那么，即使没有“银白色的”“蔚蓝色的”之类的华而不实的形容词，而只是几句简单的语句，那怕是孤立地看起来毫不出奇的语句，也满有条件成为好诗。
    作为一个读者，我阅读报刊上发表的诗篇，很少产生像前面所说的那种震撼人心的激动，我想，这不能不说是有些诗里面还缺少了一点最不可少的真实的深刻的感情。
    还有一句题外之言：像这样的歌子，应该说是有点历史意义的，可惜我们没法看到全貌，要不是“人民解放战争简史”里提上一笔，恐怕会根本湮没无闻了。我们的音乐家们对这一类的作品加以搜集、整理、刊行，不是件很有意义的事么？
