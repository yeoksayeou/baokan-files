Building the United River Canal: Connecting Thousands of Waters with One Hand
Pingdu County Achieves Unified Scheduling of East, West, North, and South Through Mutual Adjustment of Thousands of Ponds and Ten Thousand Reservoirs
Promoting Overall Development of Water Storage, Drainage, Irrigation, Power Generation, Aquaculture, and Navigation

(Our Dispatch) Reporters Hu Lei and Zhao Pu report: In the high tide of water conservancy construction, the people of Pingdu County, Shandong Province, relying on the great strength of the People's Communes, recently built a relatively complete "United River Canal" that combines storage, drainage, irrigation, and benefits. This irrigation canal runs across the entire county, cutting across ten larger rivers and more than eighty small streams, connecting the Xiaogu River and the Jiaolai River, which are one hundred and thirty li apart from east to west, achieving east-to-west water transfer and north-to-south water utilization. Thousands of reservoirs and ten thousand ponds are mutually adjusted to balance water potential, enabling more than 90% of the county's cultivated land to achieve water conservancy, and about 80% of the land to be irrigated by gravity flow.

Adjusting Surpluses and Deficiencies, Balancing Water Potential, Comprehensive Utilization

Pingdu County is high in the north with mountains, the middle is hills and plains, and the south is a low-lying waterlogged area. The terrain is high in the north and low in the south, high in the east and low in the west. Nearly a hundred mountain streams and rivers that run from north to south throughout the territory are characterized by high sources and rapid flows, rising sharply and falling steeply. In the event of floods, the upper reaches erode gullies and destroy fields, while the lower reaches accumulate water to form lakes; during the dry season, most of them dry up, causing drought in the north and flooding in the south, resulting in nine disasters in ten years. Since liberation, the Party has led the people in fighting drought and flood disasters. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, remarkable achievements have been made in water conservancy construction. By the autumn of 1959, the county's irrigated area had reached 1.8 million mu, and many advanced experiences such as "spring group river, intercepting undercurrents, and underground water power generation" had been created. However, because large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects and river, reservoir, canal and pond systems were not well connected, 50% of the projects often suffered from drought and had no water during the dry season, and the actual irrigated area could only reach 800,000 mu. The rainfall distribution in the county was also uneven, with more rain and water in the Xiaogu River basin in the east, while the rivers in the west and south were small and had little water, and the land was mostly clay soil, which was prone to waterlogging and drought. Only the Jiaolai River had a large amount of water, but because of its steep rises and falls and low-lying terrain, it could not be utilized. This shows that "organizing" the water, adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, and balancing water potential are the keys to developing gravity irrigation in plains and low-lying waterlogged areas.

The completion of the United River Canal has brought great benefits to the people of Pingdu County, especially the people in the southern and western regions:

(1) In terms of water storage, the United River Canal can intercept and store river water, capture rainwater, and intercept groundwater, implementing the combined use of three types of water. Two plain backbone reservoirs, fifty small reservoirs, and more than three thousand pits, ponds, ditches, river courses, and reservoirs are being built along the United River Canal, with a total storage capacity of 200 million cubic meters. The reservoirs in the mountainous areas have also been expanded to reduce the pressure on the United River Canal and to reserve water sources for the downstream areas. The current water storage capacity of the reservoirs in the mountainous areas has reached more than 200 million cubic meters, which, calculated at 40 cubic meters of water per mu, can irrigate the entire county's land twice. Through the United River Canal, it is also possible to intercept the water that has been lost in previous autumn and spring floods, and to intercept all 50 million cubic meters of water after the spring snow melts in the northern mountainous areas. (2) In terms of irrigation, the United River Canal itself has a constant flow of ten units; if the water volume is insufficient, water from the Xiaogu River in the east can be transferred to the west, and the water stored in the major reservoirs in the northern mountainous areas can be transferred to the south. In addition, it is possible to utilize the water from the spring group river, intercepting undercurrents, and thousands of reservoirs and ten thousand ponds in a comprehensive manner to ensure gravity irrigation of nearly one million mu of land in the south. The six communes of Zhongzhuang and Wanjia in the southwest, which used to have alkaline land and bitter water, can now use the Xiaogu River water from hundreds of li away and the mountain reservoir water from more than 150 li away to silt up and wash away alkali, improving soil quality and water properties. Through the United River Project, the Jiaolai River has also been transformed from a harmful river into a beneficial river, allowing the Xinhe Commune in the northwest, which has been short of water for many years, to irrigate 40,000 mu of land. (3) In terms of drainage, the United River Canal can not only store and irrigate, but also adjust the water system and discharge flood peaks. The nearly one hundred small streams and rivers that it intercepts used to have disordered water systems and were difficult to control. This time, the ten larger rivers were used as the main lines, ditches were leveled and streams were merged, and adjusted to become ten major drainage systems. In addition, with the flood control dikes, dams, and flood control control gates that have been built and are planned to be built on each river, 530,000 mu of low-lying waterlogged land can be permanently freed from the threat of flooding, and the soil and water conservation work in the northern mountainous areas has also been greatly strengthened. (4) In terms of hydropower generation, the United River Canal itself can generate 720 kilowatts of electricity, and there are already 33 hydropower stations that have been built and are under construction. (5) In terms of navigation, the United River Canal is ten meters wide at the bottom and one and a half meters deep, and is navigable all year round, becoming a hub for east-west water transportation in the county. In addition, the United River Canal has filled the pits and moats in villages in southern Pingdu, turning dead pits into living pits and dead bays into living bays, creating extremely favorable conditions for vigorously developing fisheries.

Relying on the Strength of the Communes, a Large Canal Was Built in Ten Days

The people of Pingdu achieved such great achievements in a short period of time, which would not have been possible without the People's Communes. In the past, when people in low-lying waterlogged areas encountered floods, they wanted to build a large dam to prevent water damage from the upper reaches; during dry periods, they wanted to use the water from the Xiaogu River to irrigate the land. Although water conservancy projects were built every year after liberation, they could only lift water, not use gravity flow, and the water source was not sufficient. Therefore, they often envied the gravity irrigation in the northern regions, and the county party committee often discussed these issues. However, they were unable to do so because of the restrictions of the advanced cooperatives on the unified use of land and labor and the difficulty of obtaining materials. Now, the large-scale and public People's Communes, with their strong manpower and resources, spent only ten days to open up a United River Canal that controls the entire county from the ground up. The entire United River Canal project involved a total of 10.44 million cubic meters of earth and stone work and more than 5.9 million labor days. However, this project, from surveying and design to construction, was entirely solved by the communes through self-reliance. The People's Communes adopted the method of large-scale corps operations, selecting 40,000 strong laborers, bringing their own tools and food, to participate in this battle. The first phase of the project required more than 6,000 cubic meters of stone, and eleven communes organized labor to bring their own explosives to mine and transport them day and night, without spending a penny. The Zhanggezhuang Commune had no stonemasons to build the reservoir, and the Chengguan Commune supported them with one hundred people, teaching them techniques while working. The large and small buildings on the United River Canal required a total of more than 5 million yuan of funds, but the eleven communes adopted the method of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, spending only 2.4 million yuan, and the state only needed to subsidize 500,000 yuan. Before the project started, the People's Communes allocated land to the production teams whose land was occupied by the canal project, helped the members move and settle down, and established new villages. The villages where the Gulong Reservoir is located were flooded every year before liberation, and more than 60% of the households fled to the Northeast to escape famine. Now they have moved into new villages with shops, schools, and nurseries. The commune also allows them to raise ducks and fish in the reservoir, and helps them establish a fish breeding farm and a duck farm on the bank of the reservoir, which makes everyone very satisfied. Seeing the strength of the People's Communes, the masses' thinking has also changed: in the past, they thought that they would have no food if they had no land to cultivate, but now they understand that as long as they rely on the large collective, it will bring them greater benefits. Therefore, the masses' enthusiasm for building the United River Canal is very high. They put forward the heroic slogan "The water is not as deep as the Dadu River, the weather is not as cold as climbing the Snow Mountain, the ground is frozen like the Yellow Springs, and three feet of snow is a good day" to fight against the ice, and as a result, the half-month task was completed in ten days. The funds used by the People's Communes to build this United River Canal accounted for only a dozen percent of the relevant communes' public accumulation in 1959, and the land occupied was also less than the area expanded from adjusting channels, leveling ditches, and merging streams.

From Single Management to Comprehensive Management

The construction of this United River water diversion project is also a new development in Pingdu County's water management experience. The county's nearly one hundred mountain streams and rivers used to be managed individually, but now they are managed comprehensively. From where to capture runoff, where to capture river water, intercept groundwater, how much water there is in the upper reaches throughout the year, how much is stored locally, how much is intercepted by the United River Canal, how much can be blocked by downstream water storage projects, how much is planned to be released out of the county, how much is used for various crops in a year, how much is used for aquaculture, how much is stored, etc., have all been accurately calculated. Then, large reservoirs are built at the source of the upper reaches of the ten major rivers to control the throat, and the United River Canal is used to connect them as a whole at the waist. Several bamboo joint reservoirs and bell reservoirs are built downstream to store the overflowing water for emergency use. From then on, hundreds of dragons are made to submit and listen to people's dispatch. This method of management is a major repair and supplement to the earth, and it is a science of transforming nature. It highly combines the relationship between the county's water conservancy projects such as storage, drainage, irrigation, and protection (soil and water conservation in mountainous areas).

    建成联河渠　万水一手牵
    平度县千塘万库互相调剂东西南北统一调度
    促进蓄水、排水、灌溉、发电、水产、航运全面发展
    本报讯　记者胡雷、赵浦报道：山东平度县人民，在水利建设高潮中，依靠人民公社巨大的力量，不久以前修建起一条比较完整的蓄、泄、灌、利兼备的“联河渠”。这条灌溉渠横贯全县，拦腰斩断了十条较大河流和八十多条小溪，把东西相隔一百三十里的小沽河和胶莱河连结起来，达到东水西调，北水南用，千库万塘互相调剂，均衡水势，使全县90％以上的耕地实现了水利化，80％左右的土地能自流灌溉。
    调剂有无　平衡水势　综合利用
    平度县北部是高山，中部是丘陵、平原，南部是洼涝地区，地形北高南洼，东高西低。由北而南纵贯全境的近百条山溪河流，都是源高流急，猛涨陡落。遇有洪水，上游冲沟毁田，下游积水成湖；在枯水季节，又绝大部分断流，造成北旱南涝，十年九灾。解放后，党领导人民一直与旱涝灾害作斗争。特别是从1958年大跃进以来，水利建设成绩辉煌。到1959年秋季，全县灌溉面积已达一百八十万亩，并创造了“泉组河、截潜流、地下水发电”等许多先进经验。但是由于大中小型水利工程和河库渠塘都未很好地联系起来，伏旱季节常有50％的工程干旱无水，实浇面积只能达到八十万亩。全县雨量分布也不均匀，东部小沽河流域雨多水大，而西、南部河小水少，土地又多系粘性土质，易涝易旱。唯有胶莱河水量较大，也因为陡涨陡落，地势洼下，未能利用。这就说明把水“组织起来”，调剂有无，平衡水势，是发展平原、洼涝地区自流灌溉的关键。
  联河渠的建成，为平度人民特别是南部和西部地区的人民，带来了巨大利益：
    （一）在蓄水方面，联河渠可以拦蓄河水，抓住天上水，截住地下水，实行三水并用。沿联河渠正在修建两座平原骨干水库，五十座小水库，以及三千多个坑塘、沟渠、河道、水库，共可蓄水二亿公方。还扩大了山区水库，以减轻联河渠的压力，并为下游储备水源。现在山区水库蓄水量已达二亿多公方，以每亩四十方水计算，可把全县土地普灌两遍。通过联河渠还能把历年在秋汛、春汛时期跑掉的水拦住；把北部山区春雪融化以后的五千万公方水也全部拦住。（二）在灌水方面，联河渠本身有十个流量常年流水；如果水量不足，可以从东边调小沽河水接济西部，把北部山区各大水库储备的水往南调用。此外，还可以集中泉组河、截潜流、千库万塘的水综合利用，保证南部近百万亩土地自流灌溉。西南地区的中庄、万家等六个公社，过去地碱水苦，现在引用百里之外的小沽河水和一百五十多里以外的山库水，可以放淤洗碱，改良土质和水性。胶莱河通过联河工程，也由害河变利河，使西北部常年缺水的新河公社浇上四万亩地。（三）在排水方面，联河渠不仅能蓄能灌，而且还能调整水系，排泄洪峰。它所截断的近百条小溪河流，过去水系紊乱，不好控制。这次以十条较大河流为干线，平沟并流，加以调整，成为十大排水系统。加上每条河上已经修建和计划修建防洪堤、拦水坝和防洪节制闸等，可使五十三万亩洼涝地永远免除涝灾威胁，而北部山区的水土保持工作也大大的加强了。（四）在水力发电方面，联河渠本身能发电七百二十瓩，现在已建成和正在兴建的水电站已有三十三处。（五）在航运方面，联河渠底宽十米，水深一米五，常年可以通航，成为全县东西水上交通枢纽。此外，联河渠已经把平度南部村村灌得坑满壕平，死坑变活坑，死湾变活湾，为大力发展渔业创造了极为有利的条件。
    依靠公社力量　十天建成大渠
    平度人民在短时间内就获得如此巨大的成就，没有人民公社是根本办不到的。过去，洼涝地区的群众遇到洪水，就想横筑一条大坝防止上游水害；干旱时期，就想利用小沽河的水浇地。解放以后虽然年年修水利，但只能提水，不能自流，水源也不充分。因此，他们经常羡慕北部地区的自流灌溉，县委也为这些问题经常讨论。但是，都因为受到高级社的土地、劳力不好统一使用和物资困难等限制未能如愿。现在，一大二公、人力物力雄厚的人民公社，仅用了十天时间，就平地开出一条操纵全县的联河渠。全部联河渠工程共一千零四十四万土石方，五百九十多万个劳动日。但是这一工程从勘察、设计到施工，全部依靠公社自力更生解决了。各人民公社采取大兵团作战的方法，挑选出四万个精壮劳力，自带工具、粮食，参加这一战斗。第一期工程需要六千多石方，十一个公社组织劳力自带炸药进山采打，昼夜运送，分文未花。张戈庄公社修水库没有石匠，城关公社支援他们一百人边干边教，传授技术。联河渠上的大小建筑物，共需要资金五百多万元，而十一个公社采取多快好省的办法，只花费二百四十万元，国家也只补助五十万元就够了。在工程动工以前，人民公社给渠道工程占用了土地的生产队调拨了土地，帮助社员搬家安家，建立新村。古龙水库所在地的村庄，解放前年年受涝，60％以上的户逃荒到关外，现在搬进了有商店、学校、托儿所的新村。公社还让他们在水库里养鸭、养鱼，帮助他们在库边建立一处鱼种繁殖场、一处养鸭场，大家非常满意。看到人民公社的力量，群众的思想也变了：过去认为没地种就没饭吃，现在懂得了只要依靠大集体，就会给自己带来更大的好处。因此群众修建联河渠的情绪十分高涨，他们提出“水深不及大渡河，天冷不及爬雪山，地冻黄泉一样干，雪下三尺当好天”的雄壮口号与冰冻搏斗，结果半月任务十天完成。人民公社修建这条联河渠，所用的资金仅占有关公社1959年公共积累部分的百分之十几，占用的土地也不到从调整渠道、平沟并流中扩大的部分。
    由单项治理发展为综合治理
    修建这条联河引水工程，也是平度县治水经验的新发展。该县近百条山溪河流，过去是单个治理，现在是综合治理。从哪里抓径流，哪里抓河水，截地下水，上游一年四季共有多少水，就地拦蓄多少，联河渠拦蓄多少，下游各蓄水工程还能拦阻多少，有计划的放出县境多少，各种作物一年用多少，养殖业用多少，储备多少等等，都作了精确的计算。然后在十大河流的上游发源地修建大水库卡住咽喉，拦腰又用联河渠串联一体，下游再修若干竹节水库和铃铛水库，把溢洪的部分水储存起来，以备急用。从此使百龙俯首贴耳地听人调遣了。这种治理方法，是对地球的大修大补，是一门改造自然的科学。它把全县蓄、排、灌、保（山区水土保持）等水利工程的关系作了高度的结合。（附图片）
