Vigorously Develop Hog Raising Production Bases
Jiangxi Province Vice Governor Wang Dongxing

Jiangxi Province's state-run comprehensive reclamation farms and farms are utilizing the natural resources of mountainous and lakeside areas to vigorously develop hog raising production bases, enabling the livestock industry to develop at a high speed. Experience has proven that mountainous and lakeside areas not only can develop animal husbandry at a high speed, but also possess unlimited superior conditions.

Jiangxi Province is a province with many mountains and little farmland. Mountainous areas account for 60% of the province's total area. This vast mountainous area contains abundant resources and inexhaustible wild feed, as well as large tracts of feed base that can be cultivated. These are extremely favorable conditions for developing animal husbandry. Over the past two years, Jiangxi has established 209 state-run comprehensive reclamation farms and 204 communist labor universities in mountainous areas. In accordance with the principles of "adapting to local conditions and using local materials," each farm and school has successively built more than 1,500 livestock production bases, enabling state-run livestock production to achieve tremendous development. Currently, the number of hogs raised has increased from 270,000 in 1958 to nearly 700,000, an increase of more than 100% compared to 1958; poultry has increased by 4.5 times compared to 1958; angora rabbits have increased by 38% compared to 1958; and cattle have increased by 7.5% compared to 1958. Other livestock such as sheep and bees have also increased significantly. In 1959, the farms sold more than 150,000 head of fat hogs that met export standards to the state, completing 103% of the export plan; poultry and fresh eggs completed 113.34% of the export task.

Why has the livestock industry, especially hog raising, been able to develop so rapidly in Jiangxi Province's reclamation farms and farms in just two years? The most fundamental reason is that they have fully utilized the superiority of the state-owned reclamation farms and farms under the system of ownership by the whole people and rationally utilized natural resources. As everyone knows, mountainous and lakeside areas are generally sparsely populated and lack materials. Only state-run agricultural enterprises can fully utilize local natural resources and rationally arrange and develop production. In the past two years, Jiangxi Province's state-run comprehensive reclamation farms and farms have concentrated their efforts and successively reclaimed 320,000 mu of wasteland in mountainous and lakeside areas. In the autumn of 1959, they spent three months reclaiming more than 480,000 mu of lake island fields. Among these 800,000 mu of lake fields and wasteland, 180,000 mu are feed bases. In addition, they organized employees to go up the mountains and into the water to collect wild feed, fully ensuring the supply of hog feed. Each farm, based on its resource situation and adhering to the principle of "making the best of simple conditions and using local materials," mobilized employees to go up the mountains to cut timber and thatch bamboo to build pigsties. They successively built more than 157,000 square meters of pigsties, with a cost of only two yuan per square meter, which not only saved the state a large amount of funds but also ensured the needs of the high-speed development of the hog raising industry. Another reason is the full utilization of advanced technology and advanced experience in feeding management. In the process of raising large groups of pigs, Jiangxi Province's state-run comprehensive reclamation farms and farms, in order to solve the shortage of labor, launched employees to vigorously carry out tool reforms, successively creating more than 20 items and more than 300 pieces of various hog raising tools, which generally increased work efficiency by five to ten times. Due to the full utilization of these tools and equipment, the difficulty of insufficient labor for raising large groups of pigs has been basically solved. Another reason is the guarantee of sufficient pig sources. Jiangxi Province's state-run reclamation farms and farms, according to the principle of "running farms diligently and thriftily, starting from small to large," built five breeding pig farms in 1959, which can breed 50,000 to 100,000 head of good-breed pigs for the state every year. In addition to establishing good-breed breeding farms, each farm also implemented the policy of "self-breeding and self-raising," making full use of existing sows, strengthening feeding management, and timely mating to achieve full mating, full birth, full survival, and full growth. Currently, Jiangxi's reclamation farms and farms have a total of 50,000 sows, which can breed more than 800,000 piglets throughout the year. This not only satisfies the source of pig breeds for state-run reclamation farms and farms but also supports the people's communes. According to the needs of the great development of animal husbandry, all branches of the communist labor university in the province have established animal husbandry and veterinary medicine majors. In the past two years, they have trained more than 5,000 animal husbandry and veterinary medicine personnel, who have been assigned to various farms to establish veterinary stations and strengthen the prevention and treatment of livestock diseases. In addition, they have also adopted the methods of running short-term training classes and teachers teaching apprentices, successively training more than 1,000 animal husbandry and veterinary medicine personnel. This not only solves the problem of weak technical strength but also lays a good foundation for the high-speed development of hog raising in the future.

Vigorously developing livestock production in mountainous and lakeside areas is of great significance for building mountainous areas and changing the backward economic situation of mountainous areas. First of all, vigorously developing hog raising production bases can turn many barren mountains and red soil into fertile farmland and promote the great development of agriculture. For example, in 1958, the Hongxing Comprehensive Reclamation Farm developed more than 12,000 hogs and accumulated more than 530,000 dan of hog manure. Applying this hog fertilizer to more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields resulted in an average harvest of 500 jin of rice per mu, an increase of more than three times compared to 1957. In 1959, the farm's hogs developed to more than 20,000, and hog manure and urine also increased accordingly. The average yield per mu of more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields was more than 850 jin, an increase of 68% compared to 1958. This shows that more hogs mean more fertilizer, and more fertilizer means more grain. Secondly, vigorously developing hog raising production bases can expand the production accumulation of state-run reclamation farms and farms and increase the income of the people. As everyone knows, hog raising is a production undertaking with quick returns and great benefits. Due to the great development of state-run animal husbandry in Jiangxi Province, the total output value of animal husbandry in 1959 can reach more than 30 million yuan. For example, in 1958, the state-run Fengdingshan Comprehensive Reclamation Farm raised more than 7,000 hogs. Calculated at 60 yuan per head, based on a price of 120 jin per head, more than 7,000 hogs can generate an income of 422,000 yuan. Among them, 450 sows produced two litters of piglets a year, with an average of eight piglets per litter, and each piglet sold for ten yuan, generating an income of more than 72,000 yuan. The entire farm has a total of 1,702 households, with an average income of more than 290 yuan per household. Thirdly, vigorously developing hog raising production bases can carry out commodity production and sales in accordance with the state plan, greatly increasing the commodity rate. In 1959, Jiangxi Province's state-run comprehensive reclamation farms and farms raised a total of more than 228,000 fat hogs and sold more than 158,000 commodity fat hogs to the state, with a commodity rate of 70%.

From the above facts, it can be seen that vigorously developing hog raising production bases is of great significance for both prospering the mountainous economy, changing the backward appearance of mountainous areas, consolidating and developing state-run reclamation farms and farms, and supporting national construction. Of course, while advocating the large-scale development of hog raising by state-run enterprises, we must also advocate the vigorous development of hog farms collectively owned by the people's communes and encourage private hog raising, and conscientiously implement the policy of walking on two legs.

Currently, a mass movement centered on collective hog raising is flourishing in various places. Many state-run reclamation farms, farms, and people's communes have seen a gratifying situation of unprecedented high-speed hog raising. State-run reclamation farms and farms must achieve greater and better leaps forward on the existing basis and strive to provide the state with more and better commodity hogs in 1960.

    大办养猪生产基地
    江西省副省长　汪东兴
    江西省国营综合垦殖场、农场利用山区、滨湖地区的自然资源，大办养猪生产基地，使畜牧业有了高速度的发展。经验证明：山区和滨湖地带不仅能够高速度的发展畜牧业，而且具备着无限的优越条件。
    江西省是一个山多田少的省份。山地面积占全省总面积60％，在这广大的山区蕴藏着丰富的资源和用之不尽取之不竭的野生饲料，还有大片可以开垦的饲料基地。这些都是发展畜牧业极其有利的条件。两年以来，江西在山区建立了二百零九个国营综合垦殖场和二百零四个共产主义劳动大学。各场、校按照“因地制宜，就地取材”的原则，先后兴建了一千五百多个畜牧业生产基地，使国营畜牧业生产有了巨大的发展。目前，养猪头数已由1958年的二十七万头发展到近七十万头，比1958年增长一倍多；家禽比1958年增长四点五倍；毛兔比1958年增长38％；牛比1958年增长7．5％。其他如羊、蜂等都有很大的增长。1959年各场卖给国家合乎出口标准的肥猪十五万余头，完成出口计划的103％；家禽、鲜蛋完成出口任务的113．34％。
    江西省垦殖场、农场在短短的两年中，为什么畜牧业特别是养猪事业能够发展得这样快呢？最根本的原因，是充分发挥了全民所有制国营垦殖场、农场的优越性，合理地利用了自然资源。大家都知道，山区和滨湖地区，一般是地广人稀、物资缺乏，只有靠国营农业企业才能充分利用当地自然资源，合理安排和发展生产。江西省国营综合垦殖场、农场，近两年来，集中力量先后在山区、滨湖地区开垦了荒地三十二万亩，又在1959年秋季用了三个月的时间，开垦湖洲田地四十八万多亩。在这八十万亩湖田荒地中有十八万亩是饲料基地；另外，他们还组织职工上山下水采集野生饲料，充分保证了养猪饲料的供应。各场都根据资源情况，本着“因陋就简、就地取材”的原则，发动职工上山砍木材和茅竹，兴建猪舍。先后兴建了十五万七千多平方米的猪舍，每平方米造价只二元，既为国家节约了大批资金，又保证了养猪业高速度发展的需要。另一个原因，是充分运用了饲养管理方面的先进技术和先进经验。江西省国营综合垦殖场、农场在饲养大群猪的过程中，为了解决劳动力的不足，发动职工大闹工具改革，先后创造了各种养猪用具二十余项，三百多件，一般都提高工效五倍到十倍。由于充分利用这些工具和设备，基本上解决了大群养猪劳动力不足的困难。再一个原因，是保证了足够的猪源。江西省国营垦殖场、农场根据“勤俭办场，由小到大”的原则，在1959年兴建了五个种猪繁殖场，每年可以为国家繁殖良种猪五万到十万头。除建立良种繁殖场外，各场还贯彻执行了“自繁自养”的方针，充分利用现有的母猪，加强饲养管理，及时配种，做到全配、全生、全活、全壮。目前，江西各垦殖场、农场共有母猪五万头，全年可繁殖八十多万头仔猪。这样不仅满足了国营垦殖场、农场的猪种的来源，还支援了人民公社。根据畜牧业大发展的需要，全省各个共产主义劳动大学分校都设立了畜牧兽医专业，两年来培养畜牧兽医人材五千多人，分配到各场，设立了兽医站，加强了牲畜疾病的防治工作。另外还采取开办短期训练班和老师带徒弟的办法，先后训练了一千多名畜牧兽医人材。这样既解决了技术力量薄弱的问题，又为今后高速度发展养猪事业打下了良好的基础。
    在山区和滨湖地区大力发展畜牧业生产，对建设山区，改变山区经济落后面貌，具有重大的意义。首先，大办养猪生产基地，能够使许多瘠薄的荒山红壤变成良田熟地，促进农业的大发展。如红星综合垦殖场1958年猪发展到一万二千多头，积猪粪五十三万多担，将这些猪肥施在一千多亩水稻田中，每亩平均收获稻谷五百斤，比1957年增产三倍多。1959年该场的猪又发展到二万多头，猪粪尿也随着增加，一千多亩水稻平均亩产八百五十多斤，比1958年增长68％。由此可见，猪多肥多，肥多粮多。其次，大办养猪生产基地，能够扩大国营垦殖场、农场的生产积累，增加人民的收入。大家都知道，养猪是收益快，收效大的一种生产事业，江西省由于国营畜牧业的大发展，1959年畜牧业总产值可达三千多万元。如国营丰顶山综合垦殖场1958年全场养猪七千多头，每头以一百二十斤重折价六十元计算，七千多头猪可收入四十二万二千元。其中母猪四百五十头，一年出两窝猪仔，每窝平均生猪仔八头，每头售价十元，收入七万二千多元。全场共一千七百零二户，平均每户收入达二百九十多元。再次，大办养猪生产基地，能够按照国家计划进行商品生产和出售，大大提高商品率。江西省国营综合垦殖场和农场，1959年共育成肥猪二十二万八千多头，出卖给国家的商品肥猪十五万八千多头，商品率达70％。
    从上面的事实可以看出：大办养猪生产基地，不论是繁荣山区经济、改变山区落后面貌，巩固和发展国营垦殖场、农场，以及支援国家建设都是具有重大意义。当然，我们在提倡大量发展国营企业养猪的同时，还必须提倡大力发展人民公社集体所有制的养猪场，提倡私人养猪，认真贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针。
    目前，一个以集体养猪为中心的群众运动，正在各地蓬勃的开展起来，许多国营垦殖场、农场、人民公社都出现了空前未有的高速度养猪的可喜局面。国营垦殖场、农场必须在现有的基础上，实现更大更好的跃进，争取在1960年为国家提供更多更好的商品猪。
