Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: Guo Moruo today issued an open letter to the Japanese people regarding the signing of the "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" between Japan and the United States.

Guo Moruo's open letter said:

“Japanese friends! Japanese youth!

“Kishi Nobusuke betrayed you, secretly went to the United States, and signed the Japan-U.S. ‘Security Treaty’ that you resolutely opposed. I feel immense indignation.

“I spent my youth and student days in Japan. I believe I can understand the patriotic sentiments and sense of justice of the Japanese people, Japanese students, and Japanese youth. I believe your anger must be a thousand times stronger than mine!

“I visited Japan in 1955 and saw American military bases everywhere. Even the beautiful Mount Fuji has become a firing range for the U.S. military. Is this tolerable?

“What do ‘mutual cooperation’ and ‘security’ mean in the mouths of those who sell out their country and the imperialists? The people of the world know. Your resolute opposition is entirely just. The entire Chinese people support you, and all peace-loving people in the world support you. I hope you will continue your efforts to make the treaty a scrap of paper and throw it into the latrine!

“The partnership between Kishi Nobusuke and U.S. imperialism is completely an anachronism. This is an insult to the Japanese people and Japanese youth. You call him the ‘traitorous prime minister,’ and I think that is very fair. But can you sit idly by and watch this ‘traitorous prime minister’ easily sell out your country? I believe you absolutely cannot allow it. Japan is the Japan of the Japanese people, not the Japan of Kishi Nobusuke. Kishi Nobusuke should be said to be no longer Japanese.

“Kishi Nobusuke relies on U.S. imperialism as a backer, but this backer is just an iceberg. The day after Kishi Nobusuke signed the treaty in the United States, the Soviet Union launched a multi-stage ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean, which completely hit the predetermined target. This is a very good contrast. Anyone today who still wants to make a fortune through wars of aggression should be said to be insane. Such a person is only digging his own grave.

“The Japanese people are diligent and brave. I love Japan, I love the Japanese people. I hope the Japanese people can control their own destiny, advance together with all mankind, and promote the progress of mankind. But I do not want Japan and the Japanese people to become sacrificial objects for the ‘traitorous prime minister’ and imperialism.

“Japanese friends, Japanese youth! I believe you will fight to the end, justice belongs to you, and victory also belongs to you. The people are the creators of history, the people are the fair judges. The people of the whole world, including the American people, will support

    郭沫若致日本人民公开信
    希望日本人民使日美条约成为废纸
    指出想靠侵略战争发横财的人是在自掘墓坑
    新华社22日讯　郭沫若今天为日本和美国签订“共同合作和安全条约”发表了致日本人民的公开信。
    郭沫若的公开信说：
    “日本的朋友们！日本的青年们！
    “岸信介背叛了你们，偷偷地跑到美国去，把你们所坚决反对的日美‘安全条约’签了字，我感觉着无比的愤慨。
    “我的青年时代和学生时代是在日本度过的。日本人民、日本学生、日本青年的爱国情绪和正义感，我自信能够了解。我相信你们的愤怒一定比我的还要强烈无数倍！
    “1955年我去过日本，看到到处都是美国的军事基地。连美丽的富士山都成为了美军的打靶场，这是能够令人忍受的吗？
    “出卖祖国者和帝国主义者口中的‘共同合作’和‘安全’意味着什么？全世界的人民都是知道的。你们的坚决反对，完全是正义的。全中国人民都支持你们，全世界爱好和平的人民都支持你们。希望你们再接再厉使条约成为废纸，把它扔进茅坑里面去！
    “岸信介和美帝国主义的合伙，完全是时代错误。这是对于日本人民、日本青年的侮辱。你们称他为‘卖国首相’，我看是很公平的。但你们能够坐视这位‘卖国首相’轻易地就把你们的祖国卖掉吗？我相信你们是绝对不能允许的。日本是日本人民的日本，而不是岸信介的日本。岸信介应该说已经不是日本人了。
    “岸信介把美帝国主义作为靠山，其实这座靠山只是一座冰山。就在岸信介在美国签字的第二天，苏联向太平洋放射出了多级弹道火箭，完全命中了预定的地点。这是很好的一个对照。在今天谁还想靠侵略战争来发横财的人，应该说是丧心病狂的人。这样的人只是在挖掘自己的墓坑。
    “日本人民是勤劳勇敢的。我爱日本，我爱日本人民。我希望日本人民能够掌握着自己的命运，和全人类共同进步，并促进人类的进步。但我不希望日本和日本人民成为‘卖国首相’和帝国主义的殉葬品。
    “日本的朋友们，日本的青年们！我相信你们一定会斗争到底的，正义属于你们，胜利也属于你们。人民是历史的创造者，人民是公正的裁判官。全世界的人民，包含美国人民在内，都要支援你们。为了促进中日友好、维护世界和平、保障人类幸福，让我们更紧密地携起手来，筑成一道和平与友谊的有生命的万里长城！”
