    Yunnan Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture

    Establishes "Fifteen Breeding" Offices at All Levels

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee in Yunnan has established specialized agencies at each level to strengthen leadership over animal husbandry, with a focus on pig raising. Currently, Party Committees at all levels throughout the prefecture have established Fifteen Breeding Offices (namely, breeding pigs, water buffaloes, yellow cattle, horses, sheep, goats, rabbits, chickens, ducks, geese, donkeys, mules, bees, fish, and silkworms). The establishment of these agencies has played a significant role in many aspects and has become a capable assistant to the Party Committee in leading the great development of pig raising.

    In the spring of 1959, the Chuxiong Prefectural Party Committee, in order to adapt to the new situation of the vigorous development of the pig-raising movement, decided to establish specialized leadership agencies from the Prefectural Committee down to the production team, from top to bottom. The Fifteen Breeding Offices at all levels have played the role of assistants to the Party Committee in leading the pig-raising movement. The Prefectural Committee and County Committees regularly held meetings to study pig-raising issues. At the meetings, the offices reported on the pig-raising situation, newly emerging problems, and proposed solutions. After the Party Committee discussed them, the offices then implemented the guiding intentions of the Party Committee into practical work.

    The Fifteen Breeding Offices also promptly summarized and promoted advanced experiences. At the beginning of the great development movement of pig raising, the Fifteen Breeding Offices at all levels discovered and promoted the advanced experiences of self-breeding and self-raising to solve the source of pigs, and using simple methods to solve the problem of pig feed, which promoted the rapid development of pig raising. At the animal husbandry conference above the commune level held by the Prefectural Committee, the Prefectural Committee's Fifteen Breeding Office widely disseminated eighteen typical experiences of great pig-raising development, promoting the development of the pig-raising movement throughout the prefecture.

    Due to the widespread establishment of specialized leadership agencies for the development of poultry and livestock breeding by the Party Committees at all levels in the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, by the beginning of December, in addition to more than 189,000 fat pigs purchased by the state and consumed by the masses, there were more than 680,000 pigs in the prefecture, averaging 2.5 pigs per household, an increase of 18.2% compared to the end of 1958. Other large livestock such as cattle, horses, and donkeys, as well as poultry such as chickens, ducks, and geese, have also been developed.

    (Reported by this newspaper) Gejiu City, Yunnan Province, in order to accelerate the development of pig raising and improve the level of breeding, feeding management, and disease prevention, has been running short-term training classes by region to train technical personnel. Each training period lasts for half a month. After graduation, these personnel become the backbone of pig raising in various places, serving as both breeders, inseminators, and multi-skilled disease prevention personnel. The first batch of 210 students graduated on December 4th last year, and the second batch began registration on January 5th.

    云南楚雄彝族自治州
    层层建立“十五养”办公室
    本报讯　云南楚雄彝族自治州党委逐级建立专门机构，加强对以养猪为主的畜牧业的领导。目前全州各级党委都已建立十五养办公室（即养猪、水牛、黄牛、马、绵羊、山羊、兔、鸡、鸭、鹅、驴、骡、蜂、鱼、蚕）。这些机构的建立，从多方面发挥了促进作用，已经成为党委领导养猪大发展的得力助手。
    1959年春天，中共楚雄地委为了适应养猪运动蓬勃发展的新形势，决定从地委起到生产队，自上而下普遍建立专门的领导机构。各级十五养办公室都起了党委领导养猪运动的助手的作用。地委和县委都定期开会研究养猪问题，会上由办公室汇报养猪情况、新出现的问题，提出解决意见；党委讨论以后，办公室又把党委的指导意图，贯彻到实际工作中去。
    十五养办公室还及时总结和推广先进经验。在养猪大发展运动开始的时候，各级十五养办公室发现和推广了自繁自养、解决猪源，用穷办法解决猪饲料的先进经验，促使养猪迅速地发展起来。地委十五养办公室在地委召开的公社以上的畜牧业会议上，广泛传播了十八个养猪大发展的典型经验，推动了全州养猪运动的发展。
    由于楚雄彝族自治州各级党委普遍建立专门发展家禽家畜的饲养领导机构，到12月初，除国家收购和群众自吃的肥猪十八万九千多头以外，全州现有猪已达六十八万多头，平均每户二点五头，比1958年底增长18．2％。其他牛、马、驴等大牲畜，鸡、鸭、鹅等家禽，都得到发展。
    本报讯　云南箇旧市为加速养猪事业的发展，提高配种繁殖、饲养管理和防疫工作水平，分片开办短期训练班，培养技术人员。每批学习时间为半个月。结业后，这些人员就成为各地养猪的骨干，既是饲养员，又是配种员和防疫员的多面手。现在第一批学员二百一十人已于去年12月4日结业，第二批又于一月五日开始报到。
