    Transforming Low-Yield Fields for an All-Around Bumper Harvest
    Mo Shouquan, Guangxi Labor Model and Deputy Director of Malu Commune
    Our Cenxi County Malu Commune, like other regions across the country, under the radiant light of the General Line and the People's Commune, achieved another extraordinary bumper harvest in grain production last year on the foundation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The total grain output of the commune reached over ten million jin, with an average yield of over a thousand jin per mu, an increase of 42% compared to 1958. While achieving a bumper harvest in grain, other productions have also seen great development. In the past, our commune had a blank slate in industry, but in the short period after communization, thirty-nine large and small factories and mines were built, including those for indigenous fertilizer, bricks and tiles, agricultural and sideline product processing, farm tools, pesticides, and sulfur mining. Forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have also experienced significant growth, presenting a thriving new atmosphere everywhere.
    Malu Commune was originally a poor commune, with over five thousand mu of low-yield fields, accounting for 50% of the cultivated land area. These fields could only produce three to four hundred jin of grain per mu in a year's two harvests. Before 1957, we needed the state to sell us six to seven hundred thousand jin of grain annually. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the total grain output of the commune reached eight million jin, with an average of eight hundred jin per mu, an increase of 32.4% compared to 1957. Grain production in 1959 was even better than in 1958. The commune not only completed the task of delivering eight hundred thousand jin of public grain but also sold seven hundred thousand jin of surplus grain to the state.
    The main reason our commune achieved a bumper harvest in grain last year was the result of adhering to putting politics in command, continuously combating right-leaning tendencies, boosting enthusiasm, and vigorously transforming low-yield fields. From the commune Party committee secretary to the brigade Party branch secretaries, all personally took command, divided up areas of responsibility, and were responsible for eliminating low-yield fields. In the commune's one hundred and fifty field plots (田垌), each plot was equipped with a plot leader, deputy plot leader, and technician, establishing a responsibility system and command post, and extensively launching mass-based over-production emulation campaigns. As a result, all eighty-five low-yield plots in the commune turned over, with per mu yields rising to over eight hundred jin, half of which exceeded one thousand jin.
    To transform low-yield fields into high-yield fields, in the winter of 1958 and the spring of last year, the commune members conscientiously carried out deep plowing and soil improvement. Brigades supported each other, collaborated with each other, and fully exploited the superiority of the People's Commune. Before transplanting seedlings, all low-yield fields were deeply plowed to about eight inches. In terms of fertilizer application, a revolutionary measure was taken last year, which was the widespread establishment of field-side fertilizer stations (pits). A total of four hundred and twenty-eight field-side manure sheds and pits were built in the commune, increasing the amount of fertilizer applied to distant fields, with an average increase of over one hundred dan per mu. This realized something that was impossible before communization, not only greatly increasing the amount of fertilizer applied but also saving the commune thirty thousand labor days in a year, strengthening other production.
    Conducting mass-based experimental fields in low-yield fields was another important measure our commune took last year to eliminate low-yield fields. Under the active leadership of Party committee secretaries at all levels, in addition to ordinary commune members planting experimental fields, youth, women, the elderly, children, teachers, students, and cadres also opened up experimental fields, totaling more than three thousand eight hundred mu in the commune. The per mu yield of these experimental fields all exceeded one thousand jin, an increase of about 50% compared to ordinary fields.

    改造低产田　全面大丰收
    广西劳动模范、马路公社副社长　莫寿全
    我们岑溪县马路公社和全国其他地区一样，在总路线和人民公社的光辉照耀下，去年粮食生产在1958年大跃进的基础上，又获得了特大丰收。全社粮食总产量达一千多万斤，平均每亩产量在千斤以上，比1958年增产42％。在粮食获得大丰收的同时，其他各项生产也有很大发展。过去，我们社的工业是一张白纸，但在公社化后的短时期里，就建成土化肥、砖瓦、农副产品加工、农具、农药、硫磺矿等大小厂矿三十九个。林、牧、副、渔也有了显著的增长，到处都呈现出欣欣向荣的新气象。
    马路公社原来是个穷社，全社低产田达五千多亩，占耕地面积50％。这些田地一年两造只能产粮三、四百斤。在1957年前，我们每年需要国家统销粮食六、七十万斤。1958年大跃进以后，全社粮食总产量达到八百万斤，平均每亩八百斤，比1957年增加32．4％。1959年粮食生产比1958年更好，全社除完成八十万斤公粮缴纳任务外，还有七十万斤余粮卖给国家。
    去年我们公社粮食获得大丰收，主要是坚持政治挂帅，不断反右倾、鼓干劲，大力改造低产田的结果。从公社党委书记到大队党支部书记，都亲自挂帅，分片包干，负责消灭低产田。全社一百五十个田垌，垌垌都配有垌长、副垌长和技术员，建立责任制和指挥台，广泛开展群众性的超包产竞赛运动。这样，全社八十五个低产垌都翻了身，亩产量上升到八百斤以上，其中有一半超过一千斤。
    为了把低产田变成高产田，1958年冬和去年春天，社员们认真地进行了深耕改土，大队与大队、小队与小队之间，相互支援，相互协作，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，到插秧前，所有的低产田全部深耕八寸左右。在施肥工作上，去年采取了一项革命性措施，这就是普遍建立了田头肥料站（坑）。全社共建了四百二十八个田头粪房和粪坑，增加了远田的施肥量，平均每亩多施肥一百担以上。实现了这项公社化前办不到的事情，不但大大增加了施肥量，而且全社一年内还能节约三万个劳动力，加强别的生产。
    在低产田里大搞群众性的试验田，这是我们公社去年消灭低产田的又一项重要措施。在各级党委书记的积极带动下，除一般社员种植试验田外，青年、妇女、老年、少年、教师、学生、干部也都开辟了试验田，全社共有三千八百多亩。这些试验田每亩产量都超过了一千斤，比一般田增产50％左右。
