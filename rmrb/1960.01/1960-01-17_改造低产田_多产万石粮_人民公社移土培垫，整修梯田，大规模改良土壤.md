Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Since the beginning of winter, rural people's communes in various regions have been carrying out soil improvement work on a larger scale than before. According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, from last winter to the first ten days of January this year, about 80 million mu of farmland in twenty-four provinces (municipalities) and regions, including Shandong, Hebei, and Hunan, have undergone varying degrees of improvement. This is more than the previous winter and spring, and the work is still continuing.

The measures for soil improvement include mixing soil in sandy land, mixing sand in clay land, moving soil for soil enrichment, building terraces, and digging drainage systems. Some also combine multiple measures such as cultivation, planting, fertilization, and irrigation for long-term improvement. At present, the main tasks being carried out in various regions are soil mixing, soil enrichment, terrace construction, and drainage system excavation. Last year, many people's communes conducted a general survey and assessment of farmland soil, and the current soil improvement work is being carried out based on this survey. Various regions organized specialized soil improvement teams last winter and are carrying out the work in a planned and step-by-step manner. Generally, priority is given to improving farmland that requires less labor, yields greater benefits, and urgently needs improvement. In the soil survey conducted by people's communes in Shandong Province last year, experience was summarized in improving thin soil in mountainous areas. People's communes in the central and southern mountainous areas of Shandong have initially transformed 6.8 million mu of thin soil in mountainous areas and built terraces, accounting for more than half of the cultivated land that has been improved in the province. The communes in the mountainous areas of Linyi Prefecture put forward the slogan "Demand high yields from thin soil in mountainous areas," and tens of thousands of specialized soil improvement teams in the prefecture completed the transformation of more than 2 million mu in a short period. Hebei Province has more saline-alkali land and low-lying land on the plains. Hebei Province is promoting the experience of Tianjin in transforming low-lying land and has initially transformed more than 5 million mu of saline-alkali and low-lying land, accounting for more than half of the cultivated land initially improved in the province.

Mass soil improvement work in various regions has achieved considerable results. In the southern provinces and regions, the cultivated land that has been improved or initially improved includes more than 3 million mu in Fujian, more than 5 million mu in Hunan, more than 2 million mu in Anhui, more than 6 million mu in Sichuan, more than 3 million mu in Jiangxi, more than 4 million mu in Jiangsu, and more than 2 million mu in Zhejiang. During the soil survey in Changde, Hengyang, and Shaoyang Prefectures and the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province, a total of more than 7 million mu of various low-yielding fields were discovered. The original plan was to only improve a portion of them this time, but now they are determined to strive for a comprehensive improvement. The soil improvement work in Jiangsu Province is also progressing rapidly. Nantong Prefecture has initially improved 1.1 million mu, exceeding the original plan. The soil improvement work in Qu County and Yuyao County in Zhejiang is being carried out vigorously. In Qu County, 179 production teams have set up large camps in the fields, and more than 700 public canteens are providing services in the fields. Yuyao County has also created many new tools in soil improvement, which have improved work efficiency.

In various regions, some soil improvement is being carried out in conjunction with water and soil conservation work and deep plowing work. People's communes in various regions are determined to strive to improve more low-yielding fields this time to lay a better foundation for a bumper harvest this year.

Improving low-yielding cultivated land is an agricultural capital construction work that is as important as water conservancy construction. Throughout the country, whether in mountainous areas or plains, almost every people's commune has a portion of low-yielding cultivated land. These farmlands have lower or very low yields under the same cultivation conditions, with some being less than half of the yields of ordinary farmlands. This greatly affects the rapid increase in average yields. According to the experience of the past few years, once low-yielding land is improved, the yield immediately doubles.

People's communes in various regions have demonstrated unparalleled power in soil improvement work. Communes in various regions have made overall arrangements for the labor, livestock, and materials required for soil improvement, water conservancy construction, and fertilizer accumulation campaigns. Many regions, especially those with lighter water conservancy construction tasks and heavier soil improvement tasks, have established specialized soil improvement teams. Local community-run factories have also manufactured a large number of agricultural tools for soil improvement.

### 改造低产田　多产万石粮  人民公社移土培垫，整修梯田，大规模改良土壤

    改造低产田　多产万石粮
    人民公社移土培垫，整修梯田，大规模改良土壤
    新华社讯　各地农村人民公社入冬以来进行了规模较前为大的土壤改良工作。据农业部初步统计，从去冬到今年1月上旬，山东、河北、湖南等二十四个省（市）区，约有八千万亩左右的耕地经过了不同程度的改良，比前一个冬春改得多，而且现在还在继续改。
    改良土壤的措施，包括沙地掺土、粘土地掺沙、移土培垫、修梯田、开挖排水系统等等；有的还结合耕作、种植、施肥、灌溉等多方面的措施，进行长期改良。目前各地所进行的主要是掺土、培垫、修梯田和开挖排水系统等工作。去年许多人民公社对耕地的土壤作了普查鉴定，当前改良土壤工作就是在普查的基础上进行的。各地在去年冬天就组织了土壤改良的专业队伍，有计划有步骤地进行工作。一般是先改费工少、收益大、迫切需要改良的耕地。山东省的人民公社去年普查土壤中总结了改良山岭薄地的经验，鲁中南山区的人民公社已初步改造山岭薄地和修梯田六百八十万亩，占全省已改良的耕地面积一半以上。临沂专区山区的公社提出“向山岭薄地要高产”的口号，全区数万个土壤改良专业队伍，在短时期内就改完了二百多万亩。河北平原盐碱地、低洼地较多，河北省推广天津地区改造洼地的经验，已初步改造盐碱、低洼地五百多万亩，占全省初步改良的耕地的一半多。
    各地群众性的土壤改良工作已获得不少成绩。南方各省区已改良或初步改良的耕地，福建三百多万亩，湖南五百多万亩，安徽两百多万亩，四川六百多万亩，江西三百多万亩，江苏四百多万亩，浙江两百多万亩。湖南省常德、衡阳、邵阳三专区和湘西土家族苗族自治州在土壤普查时共发现各种低产田七百多万亩，原计划这次只改一部分，现在决心争取普改一遍。江苏省的改良土壤工作进展也很快，南通专区已初步改了一百一十万亩，超过了原订的计划，浙江衢县、余姚等地的改良土壤工作搞得轰轰烈烈，衢县有一百七十九个生产队在田间扎了大营，有七百多个公共食堂下田服务，余姚县在改良土壤中还创造很多新工具，提高了工效。
    各地改良土壤有些是和水土保持工作、深耕工作结合进行的。各地人民公社都决心争取这次多改一些低产田，为今年丰收打下更好的基础。
    改良低产耕地是和兴修水利同样重要的农田基本建设工作。全国无论山区或平原，几乎每一个人民公社都有一部分低产耕地。这些耕地在同等耕作条件下产量较低或很低，有的低到不及一般耕地产量的二分之一。这样大大影响了平均产量的迅速提高。根据过去几年的经验，低产地一经改良，产量立即成倍地增长。
    各地人民公社在改良土壤工作中显示了无比威力。各地公社对于改良土壤、兴修水利和积肥运动所需的劳力、畜力、物资都作了统筹安排。许多地区，特别是兴修水利任务轻，改良土壤任务重的地区，都成立了改良土壤的专业队伍。各地社办工厂还为改良土壤制造了大批农具。
