Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Dispatch: According to reports in local newspapers, North Vietnam achieved remarkable results in water conservancy construction in 1959.

	In that year, North Vietnam moved 62 million cubic meters of earth, a threefold increase compared to 1958 and an eightfold increase compared to 1957. People in provinces such as Hung Yen, Ha Nam, Ninh Binh, Thai Binh, and Kien An built thousands of kilometers of rivers and canals, thousands of medium and small-scale water conservancy projects, and tens of thousands of dikes. Many provinces have already built irrigation networks.

	The Vietnamese Labor Party and the government are particularly concerned about water conservancy construction. In 1959, the Party and the government helped the people build the Thuy Phuong and Gia Thuong irrigation systems in Hanoi, the Tu Mao irrigation system in Phu Tho Province, and the large-scale Bac Hung Hai water conservancy project. Many pumping stations in Nghe An Province have been basically completed. Some larger-scale water conservancy projects in provinces such as Son Tay and Vinh Phuc have also begun construction. In the construction of these large-scale water conservancy projects, the people contributed 3.58 million workdays, completing 1.1 million cubic meters of earth and stonework. In the water conservancy construction work, the people of North Vietnam actively implemented the "mainly run by the people, mainly water storage, mainly small-scale" guiding principles put forward by the Vietnamese Labor Party, and set off a mass upsurge in water conservancy construction. From mountainous areas to plains, the masses built many small-scale water storage projects. These projects played a significant role in combating drought, preventing floods, and achieving bumper harvests. In mountainous areas, due to the implementation of the principle of focusing on water storage, ethnic minorities changed their habit of not planting early rice.

	In the plains, the area benefiting from medium and small-scale water conservancy projects in 1959 reached 1.16 million hectares, an increase of nearly 750,000 hectares compared to 1956.

	While vigorously developing water conservancy, provinces, counties, and townships also formulated water conservancy construction plans. Last year, among the 5,624 townships in North Vietnam, 4,497 townships had already formulated water conservancy plans.

	In addition, the people in various regions also repaired a large number of dikes in 1959. In this regard, they completed more than 13 million cubic meters of earthwork, a fourfold increase compared to 1939.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Dispatch: According to a report in a local newspaper on the 10th, the large-scale modern water conservancy project in North Vietnam—the South Nghe An Irrigation Project—was completed on the 6th.

	All the machinery and equipment for this project were provided by the Soviet Union. The entire project includes eighteen pumping stations with thirty-two pumps, six hundred and three large and small culverts, and one hundred and seventy-two kilometers of irrigation canals. It can irrigate more than 19,000 hectares of cultivated land in fifty-two townships in the three counties of Hung Nguyen, Nam Dan, and Nghi Loc in southern Nghe An, enabling this region to increase its annual rice production by 4,400 tons.

	At the same time, this project will facilitate local transportation and prepare the conditions for the electrification of nearby areas in the future.

	During the three years of construction, workers and local people contributed nearly 900,000 workdays, excavating and filling a total earth volume of nearly 730,000 cubic meters, and pouring more than 5,800 cubic meters of concrete.

    贯彻党的“民办为主、蓄水为主、小型为主”方针
    越南北方许多省建成水利网
    宜安南部水利灌溉工程在苏联帮助下竣工
    新华社河内电  据此间报纸报道，越南北方1959年的水利建设工作取得了巨大的成绩。
    在这一年里，越南北方填土、挖土六千二百万立方米，比1958年增加了两倍，比1957年增加了八倍。兴安、河南、宁平、太平、建安等省人民兴修了成千公里的河道和沟渠、数以千计的中小型水利工程和上万道堤坝。有许多省已经建成水利网。
    越南劳动党和政府特别关心水利建设工作。党和政府在1959年帮助人民兴修了河内的瑞芳和嘉上水利灌溉系统、富寿省的资茂水利灌溉系统和北兴海大型水利工程。宜安省的许多抽水机站已基本建成。山西、永福等省的一些规模较大的水利工程也已动工兴建。在建设这些大型水利工程的工作中，人民群众用了三百五十八万个工作日，完成了一百一十万个土石方的工作量。越南北方人民在水利建设工作中积极贯彻了越南劳动党提出的“民办为主、蓄水为主、小型为主”的方针，掀起了群众兴修水利的热潮。从山区到平原，群众修建了许多小型的蓄水工程。这些工程对抗旱、防涝、丰产起了很大的作用。在山区，由于贯彻了以蓄水为主的方针，使少数民族人民改变了不种早稻的习惯。
    在平原地区，1959年从中、小型水利工程中受益的面积达到一百一十六万公顷，比1956年增加了将近七十五万公顷。
    各省、县和乡在大搞水利的同时，还制定了水利建设规划。去年，越南北方的五千六百二十四个乡中，有四千四百九十七个乡已经制定了水利规划。
    此外，各地人民在1959年里还整修了大量的堤坝。在这方面完成了一千三百多万土方的工作量，比1939年增加了四倍。
    新华社河内电  据此间报纸10日报道，越南北方大型的现代化水利工程——宜安南部水利灌溉工程已于6日建成。
    这个工程的全部机器设备是由苏联援助的。全部工程包括十八个抽水站三十二部抽水机，六百零三个大小涵闸和一百七十二公里长的灌溉渠道，可以灌溉宜安南部兴源、南坛、宜禄三个县五十二个乡的一万九千多公顷耕地，使这个地区每年的稻谷产量可以增加四千四百吨。
    同时，这个工程将便利当地的交通运输，并为将来附近地区的电气化准备了条件。
    在三年的建设中，工人和当地群众付出了近九十万个劳动日，挖掘和填筑的总土方近七十三万立方米，浇灌的混凝土在五千八百立方米以上。
