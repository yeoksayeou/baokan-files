Xinhua News Agency, Honolulu, 17th: Nobusuke Kishi, who fled Japanese territory in a panic amidst a wave of popular protests, still seemed to be haunted by lingering fears and was nervous when he passed through Honolulu yesterday on his way to the United States.

A United Press International reporter, describing the situation when the Japanese Prime Minister, who was going to the United States to sign the new Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, arrived in Honolulu, wrote: "When he (referring to Nobusuke Kishi) stepped out of the plane, he looked a little nervous, but when he saw that all 150 people welcoming him were friendly faces, he showed an infectious smile."

The American reporter recalled the scene of Japanese students angrily protesting against Nobusuke Kishi's departure to sign the traitorous treaty and said that the atmosphere when Nobusuke Kishi arrived in U.S. territory Honolulu was "completely different from the noisy scene when he left Tokyo." At that time in Tokyo, "he slipped away when they were not paying attention."

    在一片抗议声中溜往美国
    岸信介到檀香山仍神色紧张
    新华社17日讯　檀香山消息：在人民抗议浪潮中仓惶溜出日本国土的岸信介，昨天在前往美国途中路过檀香山时，仍然心有余悸，精神紧张。
    合众国际社记者在描述为了在新的日美军事同盟条约上签字画押而前往美国的这位日本首相到达檀香山时的情况时写道：“当他（指岸信介）步出飞机的时候，他显得有点紧张，但是当他看到欢迎他的一百五十人中都是友好的面孔时，他才现出感染性的微笑”。
    这位美国记者追述了日本学生愤怒抗议岸信介出国签订卖国条约的情景，并且说，岸信介在到达美国领土檀香山时的气氛“同他离开东京时大吵大闹的情形迥然不同”。当时在东京，“他是趁着他们不提防的时候溜出来的”。
