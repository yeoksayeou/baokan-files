Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 5th. The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party today issued a message to the people nationwide on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Labor Party (January 6th).

    The message first summarized the historical facts of the heroic struggles waged by the Labor Party in various historical periods, and talked about the construction achievements of North Vietnam and the indomitable fighting spirit of the South Vietnamese people in the past five years.

    The message emphasized that the history of the Vietnamese Labor Party over the past decades fully proves that an oppressed nation, with the leadership of the working class and a Marxist-Leninist party, is capable of uniting to liberate itself. A weak nation, as long as it is determined to resist, is capable of repelling imperialist aggressors. The message then pointed out that in the future, under the leadership of the Labor Party, the Vietnamese people will certainly be able to unify the country and build socialism in the North, building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

    The message said: In 1960, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has promulgated a new constitution, the Vietnamese people will conduct a general election to re-elect representatives to the National Assembly; will celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; will celebrate the Third Party Congress of the Labor Party and celebrate the successful completion of the three-year (1958-1960) plan. In the world, 1960 will also be a year in which socialist and peaceful forces continue to achieve great victories. The people of the Soviet Union, China, and other brotherly countries will advance with great strides on the road to building communism and socialism; mankind will strengthen its confidence and be determined to fight to defeat the imperialist war plots and maintain lasting peace.

    The message called on the entire party and the entire people to carry forward the glorious traditions of the party, cultivate revolutionary morality, and learn from the example of President Ho Chi Minh's lifelong struggle for the people, for socialism, and for the cause of peace and progress of mankind. The message also called on the Vietnamese people to work hard to complete the national plan and promote the development of socialist transformation and socialist construction in North Vietnam. The message concluded by saying that under the victorious banner of the Labor Party, the Vietnamese working class and all the people will unite as one and march towards a bright future.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 6th. At the enlarged meeting held on the morning of the 5th, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front reviewed the domestic and international situation and the work of the Fatherland Front in 1959, and determined the tasks for 1960.

    Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front, said in his report that the historical events that occurred last year proved that the world situation has developed in the direction of relaxation, and the imperialist war plots have suffered serious failures.

    Ton Duc Thang spoke of the great achievements made by fraternal countries in building communism and socialism, and emphasized the achievements of the Soviet people in implementing the Seven-Year Plan and successfully launching three cosmic rockets, as well as China's continued Great Leap Forward.

    Ton Duc Thang also said that the flames of the struggle for national liberation are burning the colonialists all over the world. Ton Duc Thang said that the Vietnamese people, who have suffered deeply from the war, have always been loyal to the policy of peace.

    Ton Duc Thang further pointed out that last year, the socialist movement in North Vietnam surged forward in rural and urban areas. North Vietnam has achieved brilliant successes in all aspects of economy, politics, culture, education, and society. These achievements prove the correctness of the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    Ton Duc Thang pointed out the main tasks of the Fatherland Front in 1960: consolidate and develop the socialist transformation movement; continuously develop the state-owned sector of the economy; develop industry and agriculture; continue to strengthen the people's democratic state; improve the people's living standards, and continue to struggle for the strict implementation of the 1954 Geneva Accords in order to achieve national reunification.

    新华社河内5日电　越南劳动党中央委员会今天就劳动党成立三十周年（1月6日）发表告全国人民书。
    文告首先概述了劳动党在三十年来的各个历史时期中所进行的英勇斗争的史实，并且谈到了近五年来越南北方的建设成就和南越人民坚贞不屈的斗争精神。
    文告强调指出，越南劳动党过去几十年的历史充分证明，一个被压迫的民族有了工人阶级的、马列主义的政党的领导，是能够团结起来进行自我解放的。一个弱小的民族只要决心抗战，是能够打退帝国主义侵略者的。文告接着指出，今后，在劳动党的领导下，越南人民也一定能够统一国家和在北方建成社会主义，建成和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南。
    文告说：在1960年，越南民主共和国已经颁布了新宪法，越南人民将进行普选，重新选出国会代表；将庆祝越南民主共和国成立十五周年；将庆祝劳动党召开第三次党代表大会和庆祝三年（1958—1960）计划的胜利完成。在世界上，1960年也将是社会主义和和平力量继续取得巨大胜利的一年。苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家的人民在建设共产主义和社会主义的道路上，将以巨大的步伐前进；人类将增强信心，决心奋斗以击败帝国主义的战争阴谋，维护持久和平。
    文告号召全党全民发扬党的光荣传统，培养革命道德，学习胡志明主席终生为人民、为社会主义、为人类的和平和进步事业而奋斗的榜样。文告还号召越南人民努力完成国家计划，促进越南北方的社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的发展。文告最后说，在劳动党的胜利旗帜下，越南工人阶级和全体人民将团结一致、万众一心，向光辉灿烂的前途迈进。
    据新华社河内6日电　越南祖国战线中央委员会在5日上午举行的扩大会议上，回顾了国内和世界局势以及祖国战线在1959年的工作，并且确定了1960年的任务。
    祖国战线中央委员会主席团主席孙德胜在报告中说，去年所发生的历史性事件证明，世界局势已经朝着缓和的方向发展，帝国主义的战争阴谋遭到严重的失败。
    孙德胜谈到各兄弟国家在建设共产主义和社会主义方面所取得的伟大成就，并强调指出苏联人民执行七年计划和成功地发射三个宇宙火箭的成就以及中国继续大跃进。
    孙德胜还说，争取民族解放的斗争的火焰在焚烧着世界各地的殖民主义者。孙德胜说，深受战争之害的越南人民始终忠于和平政策。
    孙德胜进一步指出，去年，越南北方的社会主义运动在农村和城市中奔腾前进。越南北方在经济、政治、文化、教育和社会等一切方面，都取得了光辉的成就。这些成就证明了越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府领导的正确。
    孙德胜指出了祖国战线1960年的主要任务：巩固和发展社会主义改造运动；不断发展经济中的国营部分；发展工业和农业；继续加强人民民主国家；提高人民生活水平，继续为严格执行1954年日内瓦协议而进行斗争，以实现全国的重新统一。
