    Red Courtyard
    By our reporter Sun Shikai
    A year ago, the writer Lao She wrote a play called "Red Courtyard," which praised the new life of urban residents participating in productive labor after the rectification movement, becoming a microcosm of the tremendous changes taking place in the thousands of hutongs of Beijing since the Great Leap Forward. A year later, more "Red Courtyards" have appeared in Beijing. Many housewives, tempered by productive labor and work, have undergone even more profound changes in their lives and ideological outlook than the characters in the play.
    Recently, on a weekend morning, I visited the No. 3 Courtyard of Cotton Head Alley in Xuanwu District. Walking into the courtyard, I saw the uneven tiled houses. Although they did not have the sanitary facilities of high-rise buildings, they were cleaned and tidied everywhere, and the courtyard was quiet. Grandpa Ma, who lives in the north house, led me into Liu Huimin's home. Because I rarely saw adults and children in the courtyard, I first asked the question, "How many households live in your courtyard?"
    "There are fifteen households in the whole courtyard, a total of seventy-two people. Thirty or so children are in the street's kindergarten and nursery. People with labor ability have all participated in production and work. I am only staying at home because I am ill. In a couple of days when I recover, you won't find me either." Liu Huimin said, pointing to Grandpa Ma, who was sitting opposite her, with a smile: "On weekdays, only these four old people are left in the courtyard, becoming the general housekeepers of the whole courtyard. We even give the old people the keys to lock the door after we go to work. If there is anything temporary at home, we ask them to take care of it."
    The emergence of this kind of mutual trust and mutual aid between neighbors vividly reflects how profound the changes in the relationship between people have been. People who have lived in Beijing for a long time are generally familiar with the situation in the large courtyards. They have individual laborers, as well as employees of factories and mines. More than a dozen or even dozens of households live in one gate. Every day, the men go to work, and the housewives become the masters of the courtyard. They have always rarely received education and influence from previous political movements, and often quarrel endlessly over trivial matters. Cotton Head Alley No. 3 Courtyard, like other large courtyards on the streets of Beijing, used to be filled with children crying and adults scolding early in the morning. Everyone "swept the snow from their own doorstep, and didn't care about the frost on other people's roofs." They dumped dirty water and stove ash everywhere, and the children's excrement and urine were all over the courtyard. Not only was no one willing to clean it up, but they often argued over these things. Some housewives in the past would not participate in production, let alone attend meetings on the street.
    A year ago, the tide of the Great Leap Forward impacted this "dead corner". All seventeen women in the courtyard with labor ability successively freed themselves from the burden of housework, sent their children to nurseries and kindergartens, and entered street production organizations and shops. Some were workers in factories and sewing groups, and some became shop assistants and kindergarten teachers. After participating in production and work, they gradually eliminated the old social atmosphere of idleness and began to care about the collective and the cause of socialist construction.
    Who would have thought that Zhang Shumin, the mother of six children, is now the manager of the street's non-staple food store, and has also been selected as an advanced worker in the city, sitting in the Great Hall of the People to participate in the Beijing Mass Hero Conference. Who would have thought that Guo Chunhua, who had been turning around the stove for half her life at the age of forty-eight, is now in charge of the kindergarten. She understands that being a nursery worker is a noble job, and it must not be like taking care of children at home in the past. To do a good job of childcare, you must have culture. Although she has never touched a pen since she was a child, she now sits at the table under the light at night, diligently burying herself in studying culture.
    Liu Wenying has changed. All men, women, old and young in the courtyard praise her in unison. Liu Wenying used to be a well-known lazy woman in the courtyard. Every day, she didn't comb her hair or wash her face, and her house was dirty and messy. When she went to the street, she would buy whatever looked delicious. The living expenses that her husband gave her every month were never enough for her to spend. The couple often quarreled over this, and sometimes even considered divorce. For the sake of her children and some trivial matters in life, she would fight with her neighbors, and the neighborhood had opinions about her. In the Great Leap Forward two years ago, she participated in production under the leadership of street activists. After being tempered and learning in collective labor, her ideological awareness gradually improved. She understood the principle of diligence and thrift, and arranged the family's life well every month. Adults and children dressed neatly and cleanly. Sometimes, she also told her children about the beautiful prospects of building socialism and the new people and new things that emerged in the production competition in the factory. She used to be unwilling to clean even the front of her own house, but now she also cares about the collective. Seeing Grandpa Ma automatically doing the public sanitation in the courtyard every day, she also squeezed some time to help clean the toilets. Liu Wenying got along well with her neighbors, and the couple was harmonious. Her lover no longer mentioned divorce, and helped her with housework on his days off. The family lived a very happy life. A year and a half ago, she didn't even understand the meaning of the four characters "socialism," but now she excitedly says to her neighbors, "In the Great Leap Forward, everyone must compare their enthusiasm. Building socialism requires everyone to work together!"
    Such changes are no longer isolated phenomena in this large courtyard. Li Fulan, who lives in the west house, became a red banner bearer in the factory, and immediately became the news of the whole courtyard. Whether it was the sisters in the neighborhood or the old men and old women, they would say a few words of congratulations when they saw her, often with a double meaning. Everyone knew that after she became an apprentice worker in a machine tool factory, she not only made achievements in production, but also improved the relationship between her mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Li Fulan has a mother-in-law who is over sixty years old. There was a long-term discord between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. A year ago, when Li Fulan was about to leave the family to participate in production, her husband opposed it, and her mother-in-law disagreed even more, always thinking that the daughter-in-law should serve her parents-in-law, her husband, take care of the children, and cook at home. However, Li Fulan was determined to leave the family. The old woman saw that all the young and middle-aged women in the courtyard had left, and her daughter-in-law bought her something with the wages she received. The old woman slowly changed her views and felt that her daughter-in-law was on the right path. The mother-in-law took the initiative to cook hot meals every day and waited for her daughter-in-law to come back from work. She also excitedly said: "You young and strong people go out to produce, and our old lady will cook at home and do some housework."
    After the housewives left the "small world" of the family, their eyes saw further and their minds became broader. They no longer haggled over firewood, rice, oil, salt, needles, thread, and brains all day long, and their collectivist thinking was growing. Once, the whole courtyard bought four hundred pounds of sweet potatoes. When everyone weighed them, they found that four or five pounds were lost. What to do? At this time, no one thought of negotiating with the non-staple food store, and they all automatically picked out a few good ones from the sweet potatoes they bought to make up for it. Not long ago, when the non-staple food store came to deliver vegetables, they knew that it was not easy for the suburban farmers to grow these Chinese cabbages, and they rushed to buy the coreless and soon-to-be-rotten vegetables. Let's talk about public health! In the past, this courtyard also established a duty roster, with households taking turns cleaning the men's toilets and other public places. Now, it has simply been cancelled. The old men in their sixties, seeing that the young and middle-aged women were all participating in production and work, automatically took on these service-oriented tasks and also took care of receiving and sending letters from all the families in the courtyard.
    All of this may seem very ordinary to those who are not familiar with the lives of urban street residents. However, the old residents here are very excited when they talk about these changes. In this era of continuous leap forward, the large courtyards, which have always been regarded as backward in the city, have now become model courtyards with red flags flying. (Attached pictures)
    Grandpa Ma, seventy-two years old, is called the "general housekeeper" of the whole courtyard by the residents. This is him handing over the newly received purchase certificate to his neighbor.

    红大院
    本报记者　孙世恺
    作家老舍在一年前写过一个剧本叫“红大院”，歌颂了城市居民在整风运动后参加生产劳动的新生活，成为大跃进以来北京千百条胡同里发生巨大变化的缩影。一年后的今天，北京城里已经出现了更多的“红大院”，许多家庭妇女经过生产劳动和工作的锤炼，她们的生活和思想面貌比剧中人物变化得更加深刻了。
    最近一个周末的上午，我访问了宣武区棉花头条三号大杂院。走进院里，看到参差不齐的瓦房，虽然没有高楼大厦那些卫生设备，到处却打扫得干净利落，院内鸦雀无声。住在北房的马大爷领我走进刘慧敏家。我因为在院内很少看见大人和孩子，在交谈中首先提出这样的问题：“你们院住多少户？”
    “全院十五户人家，共七十二口人，三十来个孩子入了街道幼儿班、托儿所，有劳动能力的人都参加了生产和工作。我因为有病，才呆在家里，过两天好了，你也找不到了。”刘慧敏说到这儿，笑着指指坐在她对面的白发苍苍的马大爷：“平日这院里只剩下他们四位老人，成了全院的总管家人，连我们上班后锁门的钥匙都交给老人，家中有啥临时事，就请他们包着代办了。”
    邻里间出现这种彼此信任和互助团结的风尚，生动地反映出居民间人与人的关系，发生了多么深刻的变化。久居北京的人，一般都熟悉大杂院里的情况。他们有个体劳动者，也有厂矿企业的职工，十多户乃至几十户住在一个大门里。每天，男人上班的上班，上工的上工了，家庭妇女便成了大院里的主人。她们又一向很少受到历次政治运动的教育和影响，经常为一些琐碎小事争吵不休。棉花头条三号这个大杂院，和北京其他街道上的大杂院一样，过去，清早起床就是孩子哭，大人骂，谁家都“自扫门前雪，不管他人瓦上霜”，乱倒脏水、炉灰，孩子大小便弄得满院都是，不仅没人肯打扫，还经常为这些事吵架拌嘴。有些家庭妇女过去不用说参加生产，就是街道上开会也不肯参加。
    一年以前，大跃进的浪潮冲击着这个“死角”。全院十七个有劳动能力的妇女，都相继摆脱了家务的牵累，将孩子送到托儿所、幼儿班，走进了街道生产组织和商店。有的在工厂、缝纫组当工人，有的成了商店售货员、幼儿园保育员。她们参加生产和工作后，逐渐扫除了旧社会留下的游手好闲的风气，开始关心集体，关心社会主义建设事业了。
    谁能想到六个孩子的妈妈张淑敏，现在当上了街道副食品商店的经理，还被评选为全市的先进工作者，坐到人民大会堂里参加北京市的群英会。谁又能料到四十八岁的郭春华围着锅台转了半辈子，现在当上幼儿园的负责人。她懂得做保育员是一项崇高的工作，决不能像过去在家带孩子那样，要做到保育全好非得有文化不可。尽管她从小就没有摸过笔杆，现在却在夜晚的灯光下，坐在桌前孜孜不倦地埋头学文化。
    刘文英变了。全院男女老少异口同声这样称赞她。刘文英过去是全院出名的好吃懒作的妇女，每天头不梳脸不洗，屋里弄得又脏又乱。走到街上，碰见什么好吃的就买。丈夫每月交给家中的生活费，总不够她花销。夫妻为此经常吵嘴，有时还要闹离婚。为了孩子及一些生活琐事，她就和邻居打架，街坊四邻对她都有意见。前年大跃进中，她在街道积极分子的带动下参加了生产，经过集体劳动的锻炼和学习，她的思想觉悟逐步提高，懂得了勤俭持家的道理，月月都把家中的生活安排好，大人孩子穿得干净整齐。有时，她还给孩子讲些建设社会主义的美好远景和工厂里开展生产竞赛出现的新人新事。过去连自己家门口都不肯打扫，现在也关心起集体了。她看到马大爷每天自动搞院内公共卫生，便也挤些时间帮助清扫厕所。刘文英和邻里相处团结了，夫妻也和睦了。她爱人不仅再也不提离婚的事，在休息日还帮助她料理家务，一家生活得很美满。一年多以前，她还不懂得“社会主义”四个字的意义，现在却兴致勃勃地和邻居们说：“在大跃进里，人人要比干劲，建设社会主义得大家干啊！”
    像这样的变化，在这个大杂院里已经不是个别的现象。住在西屋的李福兰当上工厂里的红旗手，立刻又变成全院的新闻。不论是街坊姊妹，还是老大爷老大娘，见到她都说两句祝贺话，往往又是一语双关。谁都知道她到一个机床厂当学徒工以后，不仅在生产上创造出成绩，还改善了婆媳关系。李福兰有位六十多岁的老婆婆。婆媳间长期不和。一年前，当李福兰要走出家庭参加生产时，丈夫反对，婆婆更不同意，总认为媳妇就应在家里伺候公婆、丈夫，带孩子和做饭。可是，李福兰却下定决心要走出家庭。老婆婆看看全院的青壮年妇女都走了，儿媳妇领到工资还给她买点东西，老人慢慢也转变了看法，感到儿媳妇的路走对了。婆婆每天主动做好热饭热菜等儿媳妇下班回来吃。她还兴奋地说：“你们年轻力壮的人出去生产吧，咱老太太在家做饭干些家务事。”
    家庭妇女走出家庭的“小天地”以后，眼睛看得远，思想也开阔啦，再也不像过去整天斤斤计较柴米油盐和针脑线头，她们的集体主义思想在成长。有一次，全院买了四百斤白薯，大家过秤一分，发现其中有四、五斤亏损。怎样办呢？这时，谁也没想向副食品商店去交涉，都自动从自己买的白薯中拣出几棵好的补上去。前不久，当副食品商店登门送菜时，她们知道郊区农民种这些大白菜不容易，争先购买没心的和快烂的菜。再说公共卫生吧！过去这个大院里还建立一个值日牌，挨户轮流打扫男厕所等公共地方，现在索性也取消了。年过花甲的老大爷看到青壮年妇女都参加了生产和工作，就自动担负起这些服务性的工作，还兼管收发全院各家的信件。
    这一切，对那些不太熟悉城市街道居民生活的人看来，也许觉得很平常。但是，这里的老居民一谈起这些变化，都显得十分激动。在这继续跃进的年代里，向来被视为城市里落后的大杂院，现在却成为红旗飘扬的模范院了。（附图片）
