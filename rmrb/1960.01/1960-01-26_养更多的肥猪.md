    Raising More Fat Pigs
    To the Editor:
    The great news of the Great Leap Forward in 1959 has been announced. As an ordinary pig-raising girl, I really don't know how to express the joy in my heart!
    I grew up during the Great Leap Forward. My profession is raising pigs. When I first started raising pigs three years ago, some people laughed at me, saying, "How can a young woman do this kind of work!" I didn't care about those words. I knew that I would resolutely do whatever the Party needed me to do.
    This year, the farm's task of producing commercial pigs is even greater. The farm sent me to a pig-raising training class, which helped me understand a lot of scientific principles. I am determined to further increase the quota of pigs I manage in 1960 and produce more fat pigs for the country.

    养更多的肥猪编辑同志：
    1959年大跃进的捷报已经公布了。我，一个普通的养猪姑娘，真不知怎样才能说出心里的高兴！
    我是在大跃进中成长起来的。我的职业是养猪。三年前刚干养猪工作的时候，有些人笑话我，说什么“大姑娘怎么干起这种活来了！”我没有顾忌这些话，我知道，党需要我去做的事我就坚决去做。
    今年农场生产商品猪的任务更大了。场里派我到养猪训练班学习，使我懂得了不少科学道理。我决心在1960年把我管理的猪只定额再提高一步，为国家生产更多的肥猪。
