Yellow River in New Attire

I: One of the Nine Bends

When the Yellow River first arrives at Liujiaxia, it exudes a fresh aura; the long canyon gives it the appearance of a maiden, delicate and dignified; but it prefers to frolic. After running through this canyon, a sudden change occurs, and a forest beckons to it, so it runs westward. One of the nine bends of the Yellow River is right here. Its romantic steps have created the miracle of eastward water flowing westward.

In the twenty-four-mile-long canyon, deep black curtains hang down from the cliffs on both sides. Only when the curtains are blown do they reveal a sliver of blue sky on the precipice. Why is the sky so vast? Is it just to stir the dreams of a maiden?

If we were to use the style of a biography, we could see its future from its childhood. Its fresh skin always carries the scent of sand and earth, and its unpredictable character is very unstable, seemingly foreshadowing the coming of a storm. Originally, this delicate and dashing pace, leaped over the Dragon Gate and the Sanmen Gorge like low hurdles on a sports field, and finally, it opened its arms like a runner reaching the finish line, throwing itself completely into the sea....

II: Underground Yellow River

The tunnel is another Yellow River.

The tunnel excavated for the Liujiaxia cut-off is as breathtaking as the future main project, whether it is the 148-meter-high dam or the 25-meter-wide and 56-meter-high underground plant.

This river channel was carved through the rocks on the left bank of the Yellow River. It is, of course, an artificial river; but it is different from the Niangniang River in Sanmenxia. The Liujiaxia tunnel will swallow the entire Yellow River.

Perhaps this tunnel can be called the sister river of the Yellow River. Its appearance is similar to the Yellow River, except that this sister river is not a road opened by itself, but designed by the builders of the Yellow River. The bottom of this new river channel is decorated as smooth as a bed, and the sides are as smooth as an armchair.

It is as if this is a new outfit—the Yellow River's new attire.

This tunnel is fourteen meters high and wide. The Yellow River enters from the "Subdued Yellow Dragon" inlet and then exits from the "Soaring Fine Waves" outlet ("Subdued Yellow Dragon" and "Soaring Fine Waves" are inscriptions by the builders of the Yellow River at the inlet and outlet). The total length is 863 meters. We cannot see it on this stretch of the journey, nor can it see the sun. As soon as the flow is cut off and the cofferdam is built, the original riverbed will dry up, which means that the section of the Yellow River we usually see will disappear. It flows into the tunnel, as if suddenly burrowing underground.

Therefore, it should also be called the underground Yellow River.

The tunnel through which this underground Yellow River passes is currently the largest tunnel in our country.

III: The Road

After the first eighty-five Yellow River builders arrived here, they couldn't find a single pot, a mallet, or even a road.

Birds can fly along the canyon here. You can cross the Yellow River by sheepskin raft. But there is no road. They need the road of surveyors, the road of builders.

In the future, there will be four highways and one railway here. The railway is under construction. At present, a suspension bridge is considered the most satisfactory and unimpeded road.

The lower dam highway on the left bank was cut off by the outlet; the lower dam highway on the right bank had just cleared the rock debris in front, and the back had already collapsed. There is also an upper dam highway on the left bank, through which thousands of people pass. They are going to excavate tunnels, to transport the equipment needed for excavating tunnels. At the same time, it seems that this upper dam highway was built for the sand screening yard. Along the way, there are workers from the sand and gravel yards, iron sieves, and dust raised by screening sand. Similarly, these screened sand and gravel materials cannot be directly sent to the mixing machine in the tunnel.

This upper dam highway is still a road without a tail, because it suddenly breaks off at the top of the mountain on the dam axis. If the car drives straight past, it will fall into the Yellow River. As for people, of course, they can follow a rugged path. The road is narrow and steep, and the wind drill workers do not cherish their steel chisels, using them as railings, indicating that wherever the wind drill workers can climb, there should be a road. They said modestly: "Friends, wait! I will open up a wide road for you, but there is no time now."

The cement and equipment needed for the inlet were carried down from this small road. The 500,000 catties of wheat straw needed for the initial inlet grass and soil cofferdam were also carried from this road. They carried more than one hundred catties of grass, walked one hundred and thirty li in one breath, and then encountered this steep slope, and their feet were covered with slippery grass. Because grass was falling from each bundle of grass, it was like snow falling from the sky, and it was impossible to sweep it clean. Moreover, the grass bundles were tall, the center of gravity was on the head, and in order to go down the mountain, the head was close to the knees... On the rock where only eagles could fly up at the inlet, a steel cable was hung down, which became the road for transporting wheat straw later.

At the outlet, a cylinder sewn from a whole piece of canvas was hung down along the mountain col, which was the road for transporting sand from the upper dam highway to the bottom of the mountain.

Next to those mixing machines below, you can see several such roads, which transported various specifications of pebbles from the air along the hillside.

Walking along the lower dam highway on the left bank to the outlet is even more varied. At first, climb down along a rope, and the soles of your feet fall on the platform of the drilling machine, which is vibrating. If you want to go further, you have to be careful of the rotating belt, so you must turn sideways. At this time, your feet are still not on the ground, because you are stepping on a rubber water pipe wrapped with hemp rope. If your body sways, you can lean on the temporary wooden poles, but don't pull the wires above. At this time, you need to be calm, don't be frightened by the hissing wind pipes, and don't be frightened by the roar of the Yellow River under your feet. Summon up your courage and continue to move forward, and you will find a stone embankment of a concrete cofferdam, which, although not wide enough, is always very strong. Finally, after drilling through a steel wire rope, climbing over a sandy road like a slide, and then grabbing a rope to climb up, you can be considered to have passed this trumpet mouth.

The first person to walk past will step out a road; and the road, along with the people, shows different characteristics. When a propaganda team member climbed the hillside of the Three Branches Cave, the gong in his hand unconsciously played happy music by knocking on the rocks along the way. But when the last water pump was carried down by the porters who couldn't care about shouting slogans, it was so silent.

But the real road is under the feet of the slope cutting workers. They hang in the high altitude of more than 100 meters with a rope, only touching the rocks with their toes. In this way, they work with steel chisels in their hands as if they were in a large sports field.

In fact, that big tunnel is a real road. On this flat road fourteen meters wide, it is divided into different roads. There are roads for excavators, roads for light rail cars, and roads for cars. The formwork workers and rebar workers humbly make way, walking close to the stone wall; while the welders are like "flying celestial beings", dancing in the air. The concrete mixing workers follow their own routes, pouring sand and gravel materials, or pouring the concrete in the wheelbarrows into the formwork.

The excavation workers carry baskets on their backs and shoulder poles; the porters carry steel bars or wooden boards on their shoulders for a while. No matter who it is, there are countless stones, wind pipes, wires, water under their feet... If an empty-handed person does not want to step in the water, they can jump from the wooden board to the track plate of the parked bulldozer, which is also a road.

    黄河新装
    雷加
    一：九曲之一
    黄河刚走到刘家峡的时候，浑身散发着清新的气息；长长的峡谷，使它显出了少女的清秀，端庄；但更喜欢嬉戏。它走完这段峡谷，忽然起了一阵变幻，一片树林向它招手，它便向西跑去了。黄河九曲之一，就在这里。它的浪漫的脚步，造成了东水西流的奇迹。
    二十四里长的峡谷中，深黑色的窗帏，由两边山壁上垂下来。窗帏被吹动时，才露出了峭壁上的一线青天。天为什么这么辽远？只是为了挑起少女的梦吗？
    如果习用传记的笔法，我们可以从它的童年看到它的未来。它那清新的肌肤，总带着砂土的气味，那变幻莫测的性格，很不安定，似乎预示着暴风雨的来临。原来这个细碎、潇洒的步伐，一跃跨过龙门、三门峡如同运动场上的低栏，最后，它张开像赛跑到了终点似的两臂，全身投入了海中……。
    二：地下黄河
    隧洞，是另一条黄河。
    为刘家峡截流开挖的隧洞，比起将来的主体工程：不论是一百四十八米高的大坝，或是二十五米宽五十六米高的地下厂房，同样使人惊心动魄。
    在黄河左岸，穿过岩石开凿了这条河道。它当然是人工河流；但它又不同于三门峡的娘娘河。刘家峡的隧洞，将要吞进整个黄河。
    也许可以把这条隧洞，叫做黄河的姊妹河。它的模样和黄河差不多，所不同的，这条姊妹河不是自己开辟的路，而是黄河建设者设计出来的。这条新的河道底下修饰的像床铺一样平，两旁又像安乐椅一般光滑。
    好像这是一套新装——黄河的新装。
    这条隧洞高宽各十四米，黄河从“伏黄龙”进水口进去，然后再从“腾细浪”（“伏黄龙”“腾细浪”是黄河建设者在进水口和出水口的题字。）出水口走出来，全长八百六十三米。在这一段路程上，我们看不到它，它也看不到太阳。只要一截流，戗堤筑起来了，原来那段河床枯干了，就是说平日我们见到的那段黄河消逝了，它流进了隧洞，如同忽然钻进了地下似的。
    所以，又应该称它为地下黄河。
    这条地下黄河所经过的隧洞，是我国目前最大的一条隧洞。
    三：路
    最初的八十五个黄河建设者来到这里以后，他们找不到一只大锅，一柄槌子，也找不到一条路。
    鸟儿在这里可以顺着峡谷飞。乘羊皮筏子可以渡过黄河。但是没有路。他们需要有勘察者的路，建设者的路。
    将来这里要有四条公路和一条铁路。铁路正在建筑中。目前，一座吊桥算是最令人满意和通行无阻的一条路了。
    左岸下坝公路，早为出水口所切断；右岸下坝公路，前面刚清出石碴，后面又塌了方。左岸还有一条上坝公路，上千的人从这里经过。为他们要去开挖隧洞，要去运输为开挖隧洞所需要的器材。同时，看起来，这条上坝公路倒像是为筛砂场修建起来的。一路上，尽是些砂石场的工人，铁筛子和筛砂扬起的灰尘。同样，这些筛出来的砂石料，也不能直接送到隧洞里的拌合机上。
    这条上坝公路还是条没尾巴的公路，因为它到了坝轴线的山头上忽然断了。汽车如果照直开过去，就会掉在黄河里。至于人，当然可以顺着一条羊肠小道崎岖而下。路窄而陡，风钻工们并不怜惜自己的钢钎，用它做成了栏杆，表示凡是风钻工能够爬上去的地方，就应该有路。他们这样谦逊的说道：“朋友，等着吧！我会给你们开辟一条大道的，只是现在没有时间。”
    进水口所需的水泥和器材，就是从这条小路背下来的。当初进水口草土围堰所需的五十万斤麦草，也是从这条路上背下来的。他们背着一百多斤的草，一口气走了一百三十里路，回头又遇见了这个陡坡，脚底下还落满了滑溜溜的草。因各个草捆上都往下落草，就像天上下雪一样，要扫净它是不可能的。并且，草捆高大，重心在头上，为的下山，头又靠近膝盖……在进水口只有鹰才可以飞上去的山岩上，吊下来一根钢索，这就变成后来运输麦草的路。
    在出水口，用一整匹帆布缝起来的圆筒，顺着山坳吊了下来，这又是由上坝公路往山下运砂子的路。
    在下边那些拌合机旁边，可以看到好几条这样的路，从空中顺着山坡运来了各种规格的卵石。
     顺着左岸下坝公路走到出水口，更是变化多端。起初顺着一根绳子爬下去，脚掌落在钻机的跳台上，那块木板是震动的。再往前走还得小心那根转动的皮带，因此必需侧起身子。这时脚仍然没有落地，因为踩着的是一根缠着麻绳的胶皮水管，如果身子摇摆，可以靠住临时树起的木杆子，只是千万别揪上面的电线。这时需要沉着，别叫吱吱响的风管子吓倒，也别叫脚底下的黄河的吼声吓倒，鼓起勇气继续向前走，便是一条混凝土围堰的石埂，虽然不够宽，总是非常结实。最后钻过一道钢丝绳，爬过一段像滑梯一般的砂子路，再揪住一条绳子爬上去，才算是过了这个喇叭口了。
    第一个人走过去，便会踩出一条路；而路又随着人，显示出不同的性格。一个宣传队员爬上三支洞的山坡时，他手里那只锣，一路上敲着岩石不自觉地奏出了快乐的音乐。而当最后一台水泵被那些顾不上喊号子的运搬工人往下运的时候，它又是那么沉默。
    但真正的路，是在削坡工人的脚底下。他们凭着一根绳子，悬在百米以上的高空中，只用脚尖点着岩石，这样，他们就像在一个广大的运动场上一样的手持钢钎工作着。
    其实，那个大隧洞才是一条真正的路，在这条宽十四米的平坦大路上，又分成了不同的路。有挖掘机的路，有轻便斗车的路，还有汽车的路。模板工人和钢筋工人谦逊地让开，贴着石壁走动；而电焊工人却像“飞天”一样，在空中飞舞。混凝土拌合工按着自己的路线，倒下砂石料，或是把手推车里的混凝土浇到模板里。
    开挖工人背着筐子，扛着扁担；运搬工人的肩头上，一会是钢筋，一会又是木板。不管是谁，脚底下是数不清的石块，风管，电线，水……如果一个空手人不想踩在水里，可以由木板跳上停着的推土机履带板，这也是一条路。
