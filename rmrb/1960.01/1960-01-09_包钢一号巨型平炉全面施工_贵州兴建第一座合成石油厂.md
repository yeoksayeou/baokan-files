Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, January 8th. The foundation work for the Baotou Steel No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace has now entered a stage of intense construction. Fifteen key projects related to the early steel production of No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace, including the mixer furnace, main plant, raw material yard, ingot casting and demolding workshop, have also begun full-scale construction.

The production process of Baotou Steel No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace after its completion will be fully automated, and its scale is the same as that of Anshan Steel's "Open Hearth Furnace King."

In order to ensure that this giant open hearth furnace produces steel as early as possible, thousands of workers are braving the severe cold of minus 20 to 30 degrees Celsius to accelerate the construction of the demolding, ingot dressing workshop, and raw material warehouse. The mixer furnace plant building in the raw material system was completed at the beginning of the new year, and the mixer furnace body is being installed. Projects related to the open hearth furnace project, such as the bulk raw material workshop, production substation, high-voltage cable trench, railway, and gas pipeline, have also started construction one after another.

Recently, a comprehensive leading body was also established at the construction site of the open hearth furnace system to uniformly command the cross-construction of seven construction units. The general company's functional departments and design departments have also established offices on-site to solve problems in a timely manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, January 8th. Guizhou Province's first synthetic petroleum plant has begun construction in Pingba County.

The Guizhou Synthetic Petroleum Plant is one of the key construction projects in Guizhou Province this year. After completion, it will be able to produce 50,000 tons of petroleum annually.

Guizhou Province has abundant reserves of anthracite coal. This plant will use anthracite coal as raw material, so that local resources can be fully utilized. The plant's production processes of water gas manufacturing, desulfurization, compression, and synthesis are all mechanized and automated. (Attached Picture)

    包钢一号巨型平炉全面施工
    贵州兴建第一座合成石油厂
    新华社包头8日电　包钢一号平炉基础工程目前已进入紧张施工阶段。同一号平炉提前出钢有关的混铁炉、主厂房、原料库、铸锭和脱模车间等十五项重点工程，也开始了全面施工。
    包钢一号平炉建成以后的生产过程，将是完全自动化的，它的规模跟鞍钢的平炉王相同。
    为了让这座巨型平炉及早出钢，目前有几千名职工正在冒着零下二、三十度的严寒，加速建设脱模、整锭车间和原料仓库。原料系统的混铁炉厂房，在新年初就完工了，正在安装混铁炉炉体。同平炉工程有关的散装原料车间、生产变电所、强电地沟、铁路、煤气管道等工程，也先后动工了。
    最近，平炉系统施工现场还成立了综合领导机构，统一指挥七个施工单位交叉施工。总公司各职能科室和设计部门，也在现场上成立了办公机构，发现问题及时解决。
    新华社贵阳8日电　贵州省第一座合成石油厂在平坝县动工兴建。
    贵州合成石油厂是贵州省今年重点建设项目之一，建成以后，每年可以生产石油五万吨。
    贵州省无烟煤蓄藏丰富。这个厂将以无烟煤作原料，使当地资源得到充分利用。这个工厂的水煤气制造、脱硫压缩合成等生产过程都是机械化、自动化。（附图片）
