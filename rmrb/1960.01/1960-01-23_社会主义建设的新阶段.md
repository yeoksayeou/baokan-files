A New Stage of Socialist Construction

In 1959, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of all ethnic groups in our country adhered to the general line of socialist construction, adhered to the Great Leap Forward, adhered to the people's communes, and launched a vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy, and have already overfulfilled the 1959 plan for the development of the national economy. The great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule has been successfully realized. The 650 million hardworking and courageous Chinese people have written a new glorious chapter in the history of socialist construction! We would like to pay our highest respects and warmest congratulations to all workers, people's commune members, and revolutionary intellectuals who have worked diligently in all posts across the country to achieve the Great Leap Forward in 1959 and are now working to achieve the continued leap forward in 1960!

According to the communique published today, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the people of our country achieved a continued Great Leap Forward in the national economy in 1959. In 1959, the total value of industrial and agricultural output in our country increased by 31.1% compared with 1958, of which the total value of industrial output increased by 39.3% and the total value of agricultural output increased by 16.7%. Compared with the average annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan, the growth rate of total industrial and agricultural output in 1959 increased by 1.9 times, the growth rate of total industrial output increased by 1.2 times, and the growth rate of total agricultural output increased by 2.7 times. Compared with 1958, in terms of industry, among the seventeen major products, there were twelve whose output increased by more than 30% compared with 1958; in terms of the absolute quantity of increased production in one year, there were fourteen that exceeded 1958, and in terms of growth rate, there were nine that exceeded 1958. In terms of agriculture, although it suffered from severe natural disasters that had not been seen for decades, the output of grain, cotton, and various other crops still increased significantly compared with 1958.

Due to the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, we have completed the main targets of the originally planned Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, covering the road of five years in two years. Compared with 1957, the total value of industrial and agricultural output in 1959 increased by 94.4% (originally planned to increase by about 75% in 1962), the total value of industrial output has increased by 131.5% (originally planned to increase by about 100% in 1962), and the total value of agricultural output increased by 45.8% (originally planned to increase by about 35% in 1962). Among the 1962 output targets for the twenty-four major industrial and agricultural products specified in the Second Five-Year Plan, except for crude oil, aluminum ingots, chemical fertilizers, cement, edible vegetable oil, sugar, soybeans, pigs, cattle, horses, sheep, etc., steel, raw coal, electricity generation, metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, metal cutting machine tools, logs, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, salt, machine-made paper, grain, cotton, etc., the output in 1959 had already completed or exceeded the 1962 targets. Among them, the output of steel reached 13.35 million tons, exceeding the original 1962 target by 1.35 million tons to 2.85 million tons; the output of coal had already reached 270 million tons in 1958, exceeding the original 1962 target by 60 million tons to 80 million tons, and in 1959 it even reached 347.8 million tons, exceeding the original 1962 target by 137.8 million tons to 157.8 million tons; the output of grain reached the original 1962 target in 1958, and in 1959 it even reached 540.1 billion jin, exceeding the original 1962 target by 40 billion jin; the output of cotton also completed the original 1962 target, reaching 48.2 million dan.

Such a huge and continuous growth rate of our national economy has never been seen even in the golden age of capitalist countries. Taking the output of steel as an example, in just two years, China's steel output (excluding native steel) increased from 5.35 million tons to 13.35 million tons, while in the capitalist world, it took the United States nine years, pre-war Germany thirteen years, France thirty-three years, and Britain thirty-four years for steel output to increase from more than 5 million tons to more than 13 million tons. Even after the Second World War, Japan took eight years, and West Germany, only because it was restoring production on the original basis and had a shorter time, but it also took three years.

All this shows that, whether compared with capitalist countries or with our past speed, the development of the national economy in 1958 and 1959 was an unprecedented high-speed development, an all-round Great Leap Forward that had never been seen before.

Originally, during the First Five-Year Plan, the total value of industrial and agricultural output in our country increased by an average of 10.9% per year, which was already a high speed compared with capitalist countries. However, was this the peak of high speed? Had the enormous potential of the socialist system been fully exploited? Could there be an even higher speed? From the poor and backward state of our national economy, from the people's urgent desire to change this situation, and from the fact that imperialism has been threatening us and even occupying our territory, we all need to develop the national economy at a higher speed. The question is whether there can be a higher speed. Some people once thought it was impossible. Of course, before 1958, during the First Five-Year Plan, when the socialist revolution had not yet achieved a decisive victory on the economic front and the political and ideological fronts, when our industrial base was still very weak, and when we still lacked experience in building socialism, it was difficult to demand a higher speed of development of the national economy. However, by 1958, when we have already achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the economic front, the political front, and the ideological front, when the socialist consciousness of the people of the whole country has been further enhanced, when we have already established a preliminary foundation for industrialization during the First Five-Year Plan, and when we have already accumulated considerable experience in socialist construction, the possibility of developing the national economy at a higher speed has become increasingly obvious. Based on this political and economic situation, based on the wishes of the people of the whole country, and based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong creatively put forward the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, fully mobilizing the strength of the people of the whole country, and turning this possibility into reality. The speed of 48% increase in the total value of industrial and agricultural output in our country in 1958 and the speed of 31.1% increase in the total value of industrial and agricultural output in our country in 1959 both broke the regular growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan, not only greatly exceeding the average annual growth rate of 10.9% in the total value of industrial and agricultural output during the First Five-Year Plan, but also greatly exceeding the fastest growth rate in the total value of industrial and agricultural output in 1956 -- 16.5%.

Some people once believed that high-speed development of the national economy was impossible in economically backward countries; and they also believed that high speed would disrupt the proportional relationships between the various sectors of the national economy. The continuous two-year Great Leap Forward of China's national economy in 1958 and 1959 proved that this view is unfounded. On the contrary, precisely because China's economy is backward, the people's desire to change this situation is even more urgent, and therefore the revolutionary drive is even more abundant. This is the source of the endless power for the high-speed development of China's national economy. As for the proportional relationships between the various sectors, they are coordinated in the high-speed development of the national economy. Looking at the two most basic proportional relationships, industry and agriculture, as well as heavy industry and light industry within industry, the ratio of the growth rate of industry to agriculture during the First Five-Year Plan was four to one, and in 1959 it has been reduced to 2.35 to one; the ratio of the growth rate of heavy industry to light industry during the First Five-Year Plan was 1.98 to one, and in 1959 it has been reduced to 1.27 to one.

Why is it that the high speed and proportional relationships, which seemed to some to be impossible to achieve at the same time, have been highly unified in the Great Leap Forward of China's national economy? The most important reason is that the "five simultaneous developments" stipulated in the Party's general line, that is, a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, especially the policies of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, pointed out a clear direction for arranging the basic proportional relationships of the national economy. The national economy must be developed proportionally, without correct proportional relationships, there would be no high speed. The question is what kind of proportional relationships are the correct proportional relationships. The proportional relationships of the various sectors of the national economy are not fixed, but are constantly changing with different periods of production development. The proportional relationships between industry and agriculture, and between heavy industry and light industry, are the most basic proportional relationships in the national economy. If these two most basic proportional relationships are arranged well, the national economy can develop at a high speed, and even if certain local and temporary imbalances occur in the development process, they are relatively easy to adjust. The verification of the output of certain agricultural products in 1958 and the adjustment of the 1959 plan in the first half of 1959 created more favorable conditions for the high-speed and proportional development of the national economy. In the process of socialist construction, the proportional development of the various sectors of the national economy, and the balance between them, are relative, and this balance is constantly being broken, and imbalances are constantly occurring. Imbalance is absolute. The superiority of the socialist system lies in being able to recognize and grasp the laws of imbalance, and to constantly pay attention to achieving a relative balance in the various sectors of the national economy; to be able to actively adopt positive balancing methods, and to adopt methods that allow backward sectors to quickly catch up with advanced sectors, rather than adopting methods that allow advanced sectors to stagnate and wait for backward sectors, in order to seek balance in development. The complete set of "walking on two legs" policies in the Party's general line is a policy to ensure that the development of the national economy is both high-speed and proportional. Continuing to implement this policy will surely realize the continuous Great Leap Forward of the national economy at a high speed and proportionally in the future.

The continuous two-year high-speed development of China's national economy is also inseparable from the establishment, consolidation, and development of the people’s communes. The high-speed development of social productive forces requires reforms in the relations of production that are adapted to it, and also requires reforms in the superstructure that are adapted to the development of the economic base. This is a basic principle of Marxism-Leninism. The rectification movement in 1957, the struggle against bourgeois right-wing elements, the implementation of cadres participating in productive labor and workers participating in production management, the reform of unreasonable rules and regulations, the implementation of the method of combining cadres, workers, and technicians, etc., all belong to this category. Among them, the establishment of people's communes is particularly important. The people's communes were produced in the Great Leap Forward, and in turn promoted the Great Leap Forward of agriculture and the entire national economy.

In 1959, we encountered natural disasters that had not been seen for decades, with a disaster-stricken area of 650 million mu, accounting for 30% of the total sown area. Such severe natural disasters, if they had occurred before liberation, would have left tens of millions of people displaced and created a tragic scene of barren land and starvation everywhere; if they had occurred in a capitalist country, it would also have been a disaster that was difficult to resist. In 1959, the disaster situation in the United States was not as serious as in our country, but the total grain output dropped from 379.9 billion jin to 359.8 billion jin, and the output of wheat plummeted even more, decreasing by 23% compared with 1958. The Chinese farmers organized in the people's communes, however, overcame such severe natural disasters, not only did not reduce production, but also achieved a total agricultural output value increase of 16.7%, a grain output increase of 8%, and a cotton output increase of 14.76% on the basis of the bumper harvest in 1958. This year, not only did the output of major crops such as grain and cotton increase significantly, but also the output of soybeans, vegetables, peanuts, sugarcane and beets, fruits, flue-cured tobacco, tea, etc., increased to varying degrees. Not only did agriculture develop greatly, but also forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries all developed greatly.

This comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production provided a huge material force for the Great Leap Forward of the entire national economy, allowing light industry to obtain more raw materials and the market to obtain more abundant materials. This is one aspect of the people's communes promoting the Great Leap Forward of the entire national economy. On the other hand, the people's communes used their powerful strength to directly participate in the undertakings of various sectors of the national economy, thereby also promoting the development of these undertakings. In the past two years, we have increased nearly 20 million employees, most of whom came from the countryside. Without a social organization like the people's communes that can uniformly plan manpower on a larger scale and promote the improvement of agricultural labor productivity, such a huge support for industry would be simply unimaginable given the extremely huge agricultural production tasks and the still very backward technical equipment in agriculture. The people's communes possess greater economic strength than advanced cooperatives and can absorb more heavy industrial products to arm themselves, which is also an important condition for the Great Leap Forward of industry. Without the people's communes and without such a thriving domestic market, the development speed of industry would inevitably be limited. In addition to this, the people's communes also established various industries that directly serve agricultural production and serve the lives of commune members, accelerating the growth of the total value of industrial output. In 1959, the total value of commune industry increased by 70% compared with 1958. The people's communes established specialized transportation teams and sideline transportation teams, launched a vigorous mass movement for short-distance transportation, and participated in the loading and unloading work of some stations, ports, and enterprises. This is also an important factor in promoting the great development of transportation in 1959. In 1959, commercial work purchased more, purchased quickly, and sold well, and the market was prosperous, which was also inseparable from the huge material support and organizational help that the people's communes gave to the commercial sector. The development of various undertakings such as culture, education, and health also benefited from the people's communes. It can be said that every aspect of our social life is shining with the brilliant light of the people's communes.

The facts of the past year vividly show that the people's communes, which have embarked on the path of consolidation and sound development after rectification, have an incomparably vigorous vitality. The people of our country are deeply gratified that Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee creatively developed Marxism-Leninism and found the best social organizational form for the continuous development of our socialist cause and the future transition to communism—the people's commune. It can both guide farmers to gradually transition from the current collective ownership of the commune based on production teams to the collective ownership of the commune based on commune ownership, and from the socialist collective ownership to the socialist ownership by the whole people, and can also transition from socialism to communism in the future. The great prospects of this new social organizational form have been recognized by more and more people, and will inevitably be recognized by more people in the future.

With the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and with the continuous two-year Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, China's socialist construction has begun a new stage. This is the stage where the national economy continues to leap forward at a higher speed than during the First Five-Year Plan. This new stage of socialist construction has unfolded an infinitely beautiful prospect before us. We have completed the Second Five-Year Plan in two years, gaining three years of time. Time is a priceless treasure for the people of our country who have great ambitions and soaring revolutionary enthusiasm. With these three years, we have more initiative and can do more things to bring China's national economy to a higher level by 1962 (the last year of the Second Five-Year Plan). In this way, we can better achieve the grand goal of continuous leap forward in the entire 1960s, catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major industrial products in less than ten years, and realize the National Agricultural Development Program Outline (1956-1967) much earlier.

The great achievements of the Chinese people have put the imperialist prognosticators, who are like fortune-telling blind men peddling lies in the streets and alleys, in a very embarrassing situation. How fanatical they were a few months ago! What "China is in the most serious difficulty," what "not only is there no Great Leap Forward, but it has fallen face down," what the 1959 plan "is still a long way from being realized," what 1959 is China's "most dismal year," and so on, they really said all the bad things they could say. Now, the echoes of these frantic clamors have not yet faded away, but the Chinese people have overfulfilled the 1959 national economic plan, and completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, realizing the vow of a continued Great Leap Forward. May I ask these prognosticators: Where have you gone now? What else can you argue besides admitting that your lies have gone bankrupt?

When we cheer for the continued Great Leap Forward of the national economy in 1959, cheer for completing the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, and cheer for the new stage of socialist construction, the task before us is to strive for a better, comprehensive, and continuous leap forward of the national economy in 1960 on the basis of the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959. The task is extremely huge, but the conditions for completing this task are also very good. After two years of practice, the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes for building socialism have become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Those who had expressed doubts in the past have also largely clarified their thoughts in the face of the vivid facts. The Party's general line for building socialism has united the broader masses of the people around itself, further enhanced the socialist consciousness of the people, and further stimulated the enthusiasm of the people for building socialism, making the broad masses of the people more energetic and more comfortable. Such a new political situation will inevitably further promote the development of material production. At the same time, after two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, our material foundation has also been further expanded and our experience has been further enriched. As long as we make full use of this year's favorable conditions, hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the general line, adhere to the Great Leap Forward, adhere to the people's communes, and carry out the mass movement to increase production and practice economy centering on technical innovation and technical revolution more extensively and more deeply, we will definitely be able to achieve a better, comprehensive, and continued leap forward of the national economy in 1960.

More than twenty days have passed in 1960, and good news of "a good start" has been constantly coming from the national economic front. The situation for realizing the continued leap forward of the national economy in 1960 has already unfolded before us. Let us, the people of all ethnic groups in the country, unite more closely under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, go all out, aim high, and bravely advance towards the great goals of building China into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible!

    社会主义建设的新阶段
    1959年，我国各族人民在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导下，坚持社会主义建设总路线，坚持大跃进，坚持人民公社，开展了轰轰烈烈的增产节约的群众运动，已经超额完成了1959年发展国民经济计划。党的八届八中全会发出的反右倾、鼓干劲、提前三年完成第二个五年计划主要指标的伟大号召，已经胜利实现了。六亿五千万勤劳勇敢的中国人民，在社会主义建设史上写下了新的光辉的篇章！我们谨向曾经为实现1959年的大跃进，并且现在正在为实现1960年的继续跃进，在全国各个岗位上辛勤劳动的全体职工同志们、人民公社社员们和革命知识分子们致以崇高的敬意和热烈的祝贺！
    根据今天发表的公报，我国人民在1958年大跃进的基础上，实现了1959年国民经济的继续大跃进。1959年，我国工农业总产值比1958年增长了31．1％，其中工业总产值增长了39．3％，农业总产值增长了16．7％。同第一个五年计划期间每年平均增长速度相比，1959年工农业总产值的增长速度提高了一点九倍，工业总产值的增长速度提高了一点二倍，农业总产值的增长速度提高了二点七倍。同1958年相比，工业方面，在十七项主要产品中，产量比1958年增长30％以上的有十二项；在一年间增产的绝对数量方面超过1958年的有十四项，在增长速度方面超过1958年的有九项。在农业方面，虽然遭到几十年未有的严重的自然灾害，但是粮食、棉花及其他各种农作物的产量仍然比1958年有了很大的增加。
    由于1958年和1959年连续两年的大跃进，我们已经提前三年完成了原来拟定的第二个五年计划的主要指标，用两年时间走完了五年的路程。同1957年比较，1959年工农业总产值增长了94．4％（原定1962年增长75％左右），工业总产值已经增长了131．5％（原定1962年增长一倍左右），农业总产值增长了45．8％（原定1962年增长35％左右）。第二个五年计划规定的二十四项工农业主要产品的1962年产量指标中，除原油、铝锭、化学肥料、水泥、食用植物油、糖、大豆、猪、牛、马、羊等项尚未完成外，钢、原煤、发电量、冶金设备、发电设备、金属切削机床、原木、棉纱、棉布、盐、机制纸、粮食、棉花等项，1959年的产量都已经完成或者超额完成了1962年的指标。其中钢的产量达到一千三百三十五万吨，比原定1962年的指标超过一百三十五万吨到二百八十五万吨；煤的产量在1958年已经达到二亿七千万吨，比原定1962年的指标超过六千万吨到八千万吨，1959年更达到三亿四千七百八十万吨，比原定1962年的指标超过一亿三千七百八十万吨到一亿五千七百八十万吨；粮食的产量在1958年就达到了原定1962年的指标，1959年更达到五千四百零一亿斤，比原定1962年的指标超过四百亿斤；棉花的产量也完成了原定1962年的指标，达到四千八百二十万担。
    我国国民经济这样巨大的连续的增长速度，是资本主义国家的黄金时代也不曾有过的。拿钢的产量来说，仅仅用了两年的时间，我国的钢产量（不包括土钢）就从五百三十五万吨增加到一千三百三十五万吨，而在资本主义世界，钢的产量从五百多万吨增加到一千三百多万吨，美国用了九年，战前德国用了十三年，法国用了三十三年，英国用了三十四年。就是在第二次世界大战以后，日本也用了八年，西德仅仅因为是在原有基础上恢复生产，时间较短，但也用了三年。
    这一切都说明，不论是同资本主义国家比，还是同我们过去的速度比，1958年和1959年国民经济的发展是空前高速度的发展，是从来未有过的全面大跃进。
    本来，第一个五年计划期间，我国工农业总产值每年平均增长10．9％，这同资本主义国家比较起来，已经是高速度的了。但是，这是不是高速度的顶点了呢？社会主义制度的巨大潜力是不是已经发挥到极限了呢？能不能有更高的速度呢？从我们国家经济上贫穷和落后的状况，从人民群众要求改变这种状况的迫切愿望，以及从帝国主义一直在威胁着我们、甚至还侵占着我国的领土来看，我们都需要用更高的速度来发展国民经济。问题在于能不能有更高的速度。曾经有人认为是不可能的。当然，在1958年以前，在第一个五年计划期间，当社会主义革命还没有在经济战线和政治思想战线上取得决定性的胜利，我国的工业基础还十分薄弱，我们建设社会主义的经验还很缺乏的时候，要求国民经济的发展有更高的速度，是有困难的。但是，到了1958年，当我们已经在经济战线上、政治战线上和思想战线上取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利，当全国人民的社会主义觉悟更加提高，当我们已经在第一个五年计划期间建立起工业化的初步基础，当我们在社会主义建设中已经积累了相当的经验的时候，用更高的速度来发展国民经济的可能性就越来越明显了。党中央和毛泽东同志根据这种政治经济形势，根据全国人民的愿望，根据马克思列宁主义的原理，创造性地提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，把全国人民的力量充分动员起来，使这种可能性变成了现实。1958年我国工农业总产值增长48％的速度和1959年我国工农业总产值增长31．1％的速度，都打破了第一个五年计划期间速度增长的常规，不仅大大超过了第一个五年计划期间工农业总产值每年平均增长10．9％的速度，而且也大大超过了第一个五年计划期间速度增长最快的一年——1956年工农业总产值增长16．5％的速度。
    有些人曾经认为，在经济落后的国家里，国民经济的高速度发展是不可能的；而且还认为高速度会破坏国民经济各部门之间的比例关系。1958年和1959年我国国民经济连续两年的大跃进，证明了这种看法是毫无根据的。相反地，正因为我国经济落后，人民群众要求改变这种状况的愿望更加迫切，因而革命的干劲更加充沛。这是我国国民经济高速度发展的无穷无尽的力量的源泉。至于各部门之间的比例关系，在国民经济的高速度发展中是协调的。拿工业和农业以及工业内部重工业和轻工业这两个最基本的比例关系来看，第一个五年计划期间工业和农业增长速度的比例是四比一，1959年已缩小为二点三五比一；第一个五年计划期间重工业和轻工业增长速度的比例是一点九八比一，1959年已缩小为一点二七比一。
    为什么在有些人看来是不可得兼的高速度和按比例，在我国国民经济的大跃进中却得到高度的统一呢？最主要的原因是，党的总路线规定的“五个并举”，即一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，特别是其中工业和农业同时并举、重工业和轻工业同时并举的方针，为安排国民经济的基本比例关系指出了明确的方向。国民经济必须按比例地发展，没有正确的比例关系，就没有高速度。问题在于怎样的比例关系才是正确的比例关系。国民经济各部门的比例关系，不是一成不变的，而是随着生产发展的不同时期不断变化。工业和农业、重工业和轻工业的比例关系，是国民经济中最基本的比例关系，这两个最基本的比例关系安排好了，国民经济就能够高速度发展，即使在发展过程中发生某些局部的、暂时的失调，也是比较容易调整的。1959年上半年对于1958年某些农业产品产量的核实和对于1959年计划的调整，就为国民经济高速度和按比例的发展创造了更有利的条件。在社会主义建设过程中，国民经济各部门按比例的发展，它们之间的平衡，是相对的，这种平衡经常被突破，经常出现不平衡。不平衡是绝对的。社会主义制度的优越性在于能够认识和掌握不平衡的规律，来不断地注意使国民经济各部门取得相对的平衡；能够主动地采取积极的平衡方法，采取使落后的部门迅速赶上先进的部门的方法，而不是采取使先进部门停顿下来等待落后部门的方法，求得发展中的平衡。党的总路线中一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，是保证国民经济的发展又高速度又按比例的方针。继续贯彻这个方针，就一定可以实现今后国民经济高速度地按比例地持续跃进。
    我国国民经济连续两年的高速度发展，又是同人民公社的建立、巩固和发展分不开的。社会生产力的高速度发展，要求生产关系有同它相适应的改革，也要求上层建筑有同经济基础的发展相适应的改革。这是马克思列宁主义的一条基本原理。1957年的整风运动，反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争，实行干部参加生产劳动和工人参加生产管理，改革不合理的规章制度，实行干部、工人、技术人员三结合的办法，等等，都是属于这个范畴。其中特别重要的是成立人民公社。人民公社是在大跃进中产生的，反过来又促进了农业、促进了整个国民经济的大跃进。
    1959年我们遇到的自然灾害是几十年来未曾有过的，全国受灾面积达六亿五千万亩，占全部播种面积的30％。这样严重的自然灾害，若是发生在解放以前，将会有几千万人流离失所，造成赤地千里、饿殍盈野的一片惨象；若是发生在资本主义国家，也是一个难于抗拒的灾难。1959年美国的灾情没有我国严重，但谷物总产量就由三千七百九十九亿斤下降为三千五百九十八亿斤，其中小麦的产量更是一落千丈，比1958年减少了23％。组织在人民公社里的中国农民，却战胜了这样严重的自然灾害，不但没有减产，而且还在1958年特大丰收的基础上，又取得了农业总产值增长16．7％，粮食产量增长8％，棉花产量增长14．76％的巨大胜利。这一年，不只是粮食、棉花等主要农作物的产量有了很大的增长，而且大豆、蔬菜、花生、甘蔗和甜菜、水果、烤烟、茶等的产量都有了不同程度的增长，不仅农业有了很大的发展，而且林业、牧业、副业、渔业都有了很大的发展。
    农业生产这种全面的跃进，为整个国民经济的大跃进提供了巨大的物质力量，使轻工业得到更多的原料，使市场得到更丰富的物资，这是人民公社促进整个国民经济大跃进的一个方面。另一方面，人民公社又用自己强大的力量直接参加了国民经济各个部门的事业，从而也促进了这些事业的发展。两年来我们增加了近二千万职工，其中大部分来自农村，没有人民公社这种能够在更大的范围内统一规划人力，促进农业劳动生产率提高的社会组织，在农业生产任务极其巨大、农业的技术装备还很落后的情况下，这种对工业的巨大的支援，简直是不可设想的。人民公社拥有比高级社更大的经济力量，能够吸收更多的重工业产品用来武装自己，这也是工业能够大跃进的一个重要条件。如果没有人民公社，没有这样一个日益兴旺的国内市场，工业的发展速度必然受到限制。除此以外，人民公社还兴办了各种直接为农业生产服务、为社员生活服务的工业，加快了工业总产值的增长。1959年公社工业的总产值就比1958年增长了70％。人民公社建立专业运输队和副业运输队，开展了轰轰烈烈的短途运输群众运动，并且参加了一部分车站、港口和企业的装卸工作。这也是促进1959年交通运输事业有极大发展的一个重要因素。1959年商业工作购得多、购得快，也销得好，市场繁荣，更是同人民公社给商业部门以巨大的物质支持和组织帮助分不开的。文化、教育、卫生等各种事业的发展，也无一不得力于人民公社。可以这样说，我国社会生活的每一个方面，都闪烁着人民公社的灿烂的光辉。
    一年来的事实生动地表明：经过整顿后走上了巩固的健全发展的道路的人民公社，具有无比旺盛的生命力。我国人民深深感到欣慰的是，毛泽东同志和党中央创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，为我国社会主义事业的不断发展以及在将来过渡到共产主义，找到了一个最好的社会组织形式——人民公社。它既能引导农民逐步由目前的以生产队为基础的公社集体所有制过渡到以公社所有制为基础的公社集体所有制，由社会主义的集体所有制过渡到社会主义的全民所有制，又能在将来由社会主义过渡到共产主义。这种新的社会组织形式的远大前程，已经被愈来愈多的人所认识，今后必将被更多的人所认识。
    有了总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三个法宝，有了1958年和1959年连续两年的大跃进，我国的社会主义建设已经开始了一个新的阶段。这就是国民经济以比第一个五年计划期间更高的速度持续跃进的阶段。这个社会主义建设的新阶段，在我们面前展开了一幅无限美好的远景。我们已经用两年时间完成了第二个五年计划，争取了三年的时间。时间，这对于抱有雄心大志、革命干劲冲天的我国人民说来，是一个无价之宝。有了这三年的时间，我们就有了更多的主动，能够办更多的事情，使我国国民经济到1962年（第二个五年计划最末一年）攀上一个更高的水平。这样，我们就能更好地实现整个六十年代连续跃进的远大目标，用比十年更短的时间，在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国，并且大大提前实现1956—1967年全国农业发展纲要。
    我国人民的伟大成就，使那些像在大街小巷兜售谎言的算命瞎子一样的帝国主义预言家们，陷于十分狼狈的境地。几个月以前，他们曾经是多么狂热！什么“中国正处在最严重的困难之中”，什么“不但没有大跃进，反而脸朝下倒了下去”，什么1959年的计划“离实现仍然有很长距离”，什么1959年是中国“最惨淡的一年”，诸如此类，真是把坏话都说尽了。如今，这些疯狂的叫嚣余音未尽，中国人民却超额完成了1959年的国民经济计划，并且提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标，实现了继续大跃进的誓言。请问这些预言家们：你们现在到哪里去了呢？你们除了承认自己的谎言破产以外，还有什么可以辩解的呢？
    当我们欢呼1959年国民经济继续大跃进，欢呼提前三年完成第二个五年计划，欢呼社会主义建设开始了一个新的阶段的时候，摆在我们面前的任务，就是要在1958年和1959年连续大跃进的基础上，争取在1960年实现国民经济更好的全面的继续跃进。任务是极其巨大的，但是完成这个任务的条件也是十分良好的。经过两年的实践，总路线、大跃进和人民公社这三个建设社会主义的法宝已经更加深入人心了。那些曾经表示过怀疑的人，在活生生的事实面前，思想也大都得到澄清。党的建设社会主义的总路线已经把更广大的人民群众团结在自己的周围，更加提高了人民群众的社会主义觉悟，更加激发了人民群众建设社会主义的热情，使广大人民群众精神更加振奋，心情更加舒畅。这样一个新的政治形势，必将更大地促进物质生产的发展。同时，经过两年的连续大跃进，我们的物质基础也更加扩大了，经验也更加丰富了。只要充分利用今年的有利条件，高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，坚持总路线，坚持大跃进，坚持人民公社，更加广泛、更加深入地开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约群众运动，我们一定能够实现1960年国民经济更好的全面的继续跃进。
    1960年过去了二十多天，全国经济战线上不断传来“开门红”的捷报。实现1960年国民经济继续跃进的局面已经展开在我们面前。让我们全国各族人民，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，更加紧密地团结起来，鼓足干劲，力争上游，向着把我国尽快地建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的强大的社会主义国家的伟大目标，奋勇前进吧！
