The bitter darkness will never return, our motherland shines brightly!
The Uzbek people stand tall,
Long live, long live Chairman Mao!
Today we live in freedom,
Today we sing with joy,
The Uzbek people live in a great era,
Long live, long live Chairman Mao!
Our days are so beautiful,
The red flowers of labor bloom across the land,
The Uzbek people grow in labor,
Long live, long live Chairman Mao!
All ethnic groups are as close as brothers,
We are all masters of the motherland,
We are all building a great motherland,
Long live, long live Chairman Mao!

Coming to Xinjiang, whether you go to the shady Uyghur villages or the lush Kazakh pastures, you can hear such songs praising the great leader everywhere.

In the Uyghur villages of southern Xinjiang, there is a 75-year-old Uyghur farmer named Kurban Tulum, who lives in Yutian County at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains. Before liberation, he worked as a serf for landlords for sixteen years and suffered greatly. In the new society, he has his own home, lives a happy life, and has also won the honorary title of county-level labor model. Never forgetting the well-digger while drinking water, this old man thinks of Chairman Mao every day. When the apricots are ripe, he dries the best apricot kernels; when the cantaloupes are ripe, he picks a few of the sweetest ones to preserve. He is going to send these things to Chairman Mao himself. As the days passed, his wish had not yet been realized. So, he prepared enough rations and gifts and decided to ride his donkey alone to Beijing to see Chairman Mao. Everyone dissuaded him, telling him that Beijing was tens of thousands of miles away from Yutian, how could he get there riding a donkey?! On National Day in 1958, the old man finally went to Beijing as a labor model and met Chairman Mao. Kurban Tulum's feelings are a profound portrayal of the love of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang for their leader. In order to express their thoughts of Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups often sing:

	The flowing water of the Tarim River,
	Sings day and night;
	The Communist Party and Chairman Mao,
	Are forever in our hearts.
		(Uyghur folk song)

	Great leader Chairman Mao,
	I want to let the spring breeze bring you songs;
	The song is the most precious gift of the Kazakhs,
	The song contains the shepherd's gratitude.

	The shepherd looks to the east every day,
	Because the east reflects your glory,
	If the shepherd hears your name,
	No power can stop him from moving forward.
		(Kazakh folk song)

From the Junggar Basin to the Tarim Basin, from the Altai Mountain grasslands to the Pamir Plateau, everywhere presents a thriving scene. Facing today's happy life, the people of all ethnic groups compare the past and the present, and sing their sincere feelings:

	At night, wearing a worn-out sheepskin coat,
	Go outside the tent to visit the flock;
	Thinking of the life before liberation,
	Filled with endless sadness.

	Chairman Mao is a spring of happiness,
	Flowing into our barren grasslands;
	The grassland has changed its appearance,
	Our hearts are like flowers blooming.

	Our livestock herds are increasing year by year,
	Our livestock herds are getting stronger and stronger year by year,
	Our life is getting happier day by day,
	Our enthusiasm for labor is getting higher and higher day by day.

	Thank you, Chairman Mao,
	Thank you! Communist Party,
	The little foal will never leave the herd,
	We will never leave the Communist Party.
		(Kazakh folk song)

	Without sufficient sunlight,
	Everything will wither;
	If the Communist Party hadn't come,
	How could our hometown be liberated.

	Respected leader Chairman Mao,
	Without you, we would have no happiness;
	Your prestige is like the towering Tianshan Mountains,
	Your kindness is like the spring sun.
		(Uyghur folk song)

	Waves rise and fall in the river,
	The grasslands are full of cattle and sheep,
	The Kazakh heart is full of love,
	Joyful songs flutter in the wind.

	The Kazakh rides a jujube-red horse,
	Galloping on the vast grasslands,
	Sheep are fat, cattle and horses are strong,
	The flowers of happiness are fragrant.

	Red flowers bloom all over the grassland,
	The Kazakhs sing heartily,
	Singing of benefactor Chairman Mao,
	Singing of benefactor the Communist Party.
		(Kazakh folk song)

Under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have moved from mutual aid teams and cooperatives to people's communes in recent years, and production has been developing day by day. They sing countless moving folk songs, praising Chairman Mao's wise leadership: Our shoulders are like iron, our fists are like steel, we live in a liberated era, everyone dares to think, everyone dares to do, with the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we can go to heaven even without a ladder.
		(Uyghur folk song) We fight in the fields; holding high the Party's red flag forward. In the embrace of the people's commune, we dug ten thousand ditches. Snow water is drawn from the high mountains, and the golden wheat waves are endless. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, happy songs can never be finished.
		(Uyghur folk song) New songs in the mountains come one after another, and happy events in the mountains come one after another; here, wasteland has been opened up, and there, pastures have been opened up. Ah! Our grassland has grown wings, following the white swans, flying in the sky. The old herdsman plays the Dombra and sings heartily, the old voice sings new songs of happiness; the happy songs echo in the mountains, the happy songs fly in the white clouds, ah! The hometown is like paradise, and the happy life does not come from the sky, all this is because of the people's commune, Chairman Mao's good idea for the herders.
		(Kazakh folk song)

### 新疆各族人民歌唱毛主席

专栏：

    新疆各族人民歌唱毛主席苦难的黑夜不会再来，我们的祖国光芒四射！乌孜别克人挺起了胸脯，万岁，万岁毛主席！今天我们自由地生活，今天我们愉快地歌唱，乌孜别克人生活在伟大时代，万岁，万岁毛主席！我们的日子多么美好，劳动的红花开遍大地，乌孜别克人在劳动中成长，万岁，万岁毛主席！各族人民亲如兄弟，我们都是祖国的主人，我们都在建设伟大的祖国，万岁，万岁毛主席！
    来到新疆，不管你走到绿荫蔽日的维吾尔农村，或是碧绿千里的哈萨克牧场，到处都可听到这样的歌颂伟大领袖的歌声。
    在新疆南部维吾尔族农村中，有一位居住在昆仑山下于田县的七十五岁的维吾尔族老农库尔班·吐鲁木，解放前给地主作了十六年农奴，受尽了磨难。在新社会里，他有了自己的家，过着幸福的生活，而且还荣获全县劳动模范的光荣称号。喝水不忘掘井人，这个老人天天都在想念毛主席。杏子熟了，他晾出最好的杏干；哈密瓜熟了，他摘几个最甜的保存起来。他准备把这些东西亲自给毛主席送去。日子一天天过去了，他的心愿还没有实现。于是，他备足粮饷，带上礼物，决定骑上毛驴，独自上北京看毛主席去。大家劝阻他，告诉他北京离于田有几万里，骑毛驴如何走得到！？1958年国庆节，老人终于以劳动模范的身份上北京见了毛主席。库尔班·吐鲁木这种感情，正是新疆各族人民热爱自己领袖的深刻写照。各族人民为了抒发自己对毛主席的思念，经常这样唱道：
    塔里木河的流水，
    日夜不停地歌唱；
    共产党和毛主席，
    永远在我们的心上。
    （维吾尔民歌）
    伟大的领袖毛主席，
    我要让春风把歌儿带给你；
    歌儿是哈萨克最宝贵的礼物，
    歌儿里藏着牧羊人的谢意。
    牧羊人每天都要望一望东方，
    因为东方映照着你的光辉，
    牧羊人要是听到你的名字，
    什么力量也不能阻挡他前进。
    （哈萨克民歌）
    从准噶尔盆地到塔里木盆地，从阿尔泰山草原到帕米尔高原，到处呈现出一片欣欣向荣的景象。各族人民面对今天幸福的生活，对比今昔，唱出了他们心头真挚的感情：
    夜晚披件破旧的皮袄，
    到帐篷外去探视羊群；
    想起解放前过的那段生活，
    充满了说不完的悲伤。
    毛主席是幸福的清泉，
    流进了我们荒芜的草原；
    草原改变了模样，
    我们的心像花儿开放。
    我们的畜群一年年增多，
    我们的畜群一年年健壮，
    我们的生活一天天幸福，
    我们的劳动热情一天天高涨。
    感谢你啊，毛主席，
    感谢你啊！共产党，
    小马驹永远不离开马群，
    我们永远也不离开共产党。
    （哈萨克民歌）
    如果没有充足的阳光，
    万物就要枯黄；
    要不是来了共产党，
    家乡哪能得到解放。
    敬爱的领袖毛主席，
    没有你，我们就没有幸福；
    你的威名像耸立的天山，
    你的恩情像春天的太阳。
    （维吾尔民歌）
    河里起伏着波浪，
    草原遍地是牛羊，
    哈萨克心里充满了爱，
    愉快的歌声随风飘扬。
    哈萨克跨上枣红马，
    奔驰在广阔无边的草原上，
    羊儿肥，牛马壮，
    幸福的花儿扑鼻香。
    草原上红花遍开，
    哈萨克纵情地歌唱，
    歌唱恩人毛主席，
    歌唱恩人共产党。
   （哈萨克民歌）
    新疆各族人民按照党和毛主席的指引，几年来从互助组、合作社走向人民公社化，生产天天发展。他们唱出无数首动人的民歌，歌颂毛主席的英明领导：我们的肩膀似铁，我们的拳头似钢，我们生活在解放了的时代，人人敢想，个个敢干，有了党和毛主席的领导，没有梯子我们也能上天堂。
    （维吾尔民歌）我们奋战田间；高举着党的红旗向前。在人民公社的怀抱里，挖出了万道水渠。从高高的山上引下雪水，金色的麦浪望不到边。在党和毛主席的领导下，幸福的歌儿唱不完。
    （维吾尔民歌）山里的新歌一个接一个，山里的喜事一桩连一桩；这里开了荒地，那里辟了牧场。呵！我们的草原长起了翅膀，跟着那洁白的天鹅，在天空飞翔。老牧人弹着冬不拉纵情歌唱，苍老的歌喉唱着幸福的新歌；幸福的歌声在山间回响幸福的歌声在白云里飞扬，呵！家乡像天堂一样，幸福的生活不是来自天上，这都是因为有了人民公社，毛主席给牧民出的好主张。
    （哈萨克民歌）
