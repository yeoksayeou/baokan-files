　　Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, 27th. Belgian Deputy Prime Minister Lilar announced today that the representatives of the Congolese and Belgian governments participating in the round table conference to discuss the political future of the Congo reached the following agreement this morning: Belgian Congo will declare independence on June 30th of this year.
    The Belgian government was forced to agree to the independence of the Congo under the irresistible trend of the Congolese people's movement for national independence. It is reported that the Congolese representatives participating in the round table conference had requested independence to be realized on June 1st of this year. However, the representatives of the Belgian government, on the pretext that preparations could not be completed in time before June 1st, advocated postponing the date of the Congo's declaration of independence to June 30th.
    It was announced that both sides also reached an agreement: the Congo will hold elections between May and June of this year; the new Congolese government will be established on June 20th; and the newly elected Congolese parliament will hold its first meeting on June 30th.
    Kanza, Vice-Chairman of the Congolese Abaco Party, expressed the hope after the meeting that the Belgian government would respect the agreement reached by both sides.
    Patrice Lumumba, Chairman of the Congolese National Movement, who was just released by the Belgian authorities, arrived here by plane yesterday to participate in the round table conference. After his arrival, he told reporters that the Congolese people are very eager to obtain their political independence. Lumumba explained to reporters the abuse he suffered in the colonialists' prison. He showed everyone the scars on his wrist caused by being shackled. He said that he was bruised all over, and the colonialists threw him into the plane "like a piece of wood."

    比利时当局宣布已同刚果代表达成协议
    比属刚果将在六月宣告独立
    新华社布鲁塞尔27日电　比利时副首相李拉尔今天宣布，参加讨论刚果政治前途问题的圆桌会议的刚果和比利时政府的代表在今天上午达成下列协议：比属刚果将在今年6月30日宣布独立。
    比利时政府是在刚果人民争取民族独立的运动势不可挡的情况下，被迫同意刚果实现独立的。据报道，参加圆桌会议的刚果代表曾经要求在今年6月1日实现独立。但是，比利时政府的代表以在6月1日以前不能及时做好准备工作为借口，主张把刚果宣布独立的日期推迟到6月30日。
    据宣布，双方还达成协议：刚果将在今年5月和6月间举行选举；刚果的新政府将在6月20日成立；新选出的刚果议会将在6月30日举行首次会议。
    刚果阿巴科党副主席坎扎在会后表示希望比利时政府尊重双方达成的协议。
    刚刚被比利时当局释放的刚果民族运动党主席卢蒙巴已经在昨天乘飞机到达这里，以便参加圆桌会议。他到达后对新闻记者说，刚果人民非常渴望获得他们的政治独立。卢蒙巴向记者们说明了他在殖民者的监狱里受到虐待的情况。他把手腕上由于被戴上镣铐而造成的伤痕给大家看。他说，他遍体鳞伤，殖民者把他“当一块木头一样”扔进飞机里。
