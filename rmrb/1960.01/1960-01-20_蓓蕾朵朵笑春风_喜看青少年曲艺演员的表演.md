    Buds Smiling in the Spring Breeze
    ——A Joyful Look at the Performances of Young Quyi Performers
    Shen Pengnian
    Recently, at the capital's outstanding Quyi program presentation performance meeting, many young Quyi performers emerged. They are young, good at both singing and playing instruments, and enthusiastically sing about the great Party and Chairman Mao, the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, the People's Commune, and the contemporary heroes of workers, peasants, and soldiers, giving people a refreshing feeling about the art of Quyi. Even more exciting is that there are many young Quyi performers as well. Originally, the art of Quyi is not easy to master. This art of language requires the actors to sing clearly and accurately, speak vividly, and play the pipa and sanxian skillfully and beautifully. Cultivating young Quyi performers is not easy. The Great Leap Forward greatly promoted Quyi work. At the opening ceremony of the 1960 Quyi Outstanding Program Presentation Performance Meeting, teams of Young Pioneers appeared, standing together with young actors wearing Communist Youth League badges, accounting for 72% of the total number of actors. The four generations of Quyi performers – elderly, middle-aged, young, and children – are a delightful sight. From the young actors, we see the future prosperity of Quyi work.
    The question of whether Quyi can pass on apprentices quickly, well, and economically has also been solved. Young actors who have just been trained for a year or two can perform "Zhao Yun Intercepts the River" in great detail, with meticulous attention to tune and gesture. Not only that, but he can also sing about people's heroes, forcefully singing about Huang Jiguang with a new tune. He can also play the sanxian and erhu. There is a pair of brother and sister actors in Sichuan Qingyin. In just over a year, they have learned nearly twenty segments. The brother and sister's performance of "Flying Kites" is extremely lively. Children singing about flying kites have an advantage that adult actors cannot match. The young actor from Hebei Province who sings the Leting Drum "Xiao Gu Xian" can clearly sing the expressions and tones of the three characters, and also masters the rhythm of fast and slow relatively steadily and accurately. The performances of the young actors made the entire presentation performance full of vitality and joy. The audience's praise is easy to understand. The young actors themselves understand it more clearly. They said that they can learn a little art because of Chairman Mao's care, the Party's cultivation, the teacher's painstaking teaching, and the love and support of the vast audience.
    Teachers often talk to them about their own tragic experiences of learning art in childhood, being beaten and scolded, suffering from cold and hunger, and often learning for three or four years, only learning to run errands, take care of children, and cook. Only those with a sense of mind could "steal" a little skill to make a living. Only those who met a kind-hearted teacher could learn a smattering. Because that was a society where teaching apprentices would starve the teacher, the teachers had to say, "The master leads you in, but the cultivation is up to you." Today's teachers have an evaluation from the children: teachers love us like their own children. Teaching singing is teaching word by word, teaching drum board instruments is teaching hand in hand, teaching gestures is teaching move by move. After finishing their own work, the teachers sometimes forget to eat or rest, and immediately tell the students "live". Some teachers insist on teaching even when they are sick. They say that the children's skills cannot be delayed for a day. The teachers realize that teaching apprentices is to cultivate successors for the Quyi cause and to cultivate socialist Quyi singers.
    The teachers also often talked to their apprentices about the situation in the theaters in the old society. Only a few Quyi actors could perform in the parks, and the hardships were hard to describe in a few words. The theaters were full of smog, and the local bullies, ruffians and capitalists were the main audience. None of the young actors who came on stage for the first time were not trembling with fear. If a sentence was wrong, they would be mercilessly booed, and they would be beaten and scolded severely after the stage, which was unspeakable. Today's audience also regards the young actors as their own children, and enthusiastically encourages them with a little bit of goodness; If there is a mistake, the audience, the working people, are more anxious than on the stage, full of love for the young actors. Sometimes they also offer suggestions in good faith to help.
    How did all these gratifying phenomena come about? In a word, because we have a superior socialist system. Seedlings suitable for development in any direction can get sunshine and nectar, grow vigorously, and grow stronger. Why are teachers different from teachers in the old society? Why have the audience undergone a thorough change?
    The children answered well: this era is the happiest era.
    Yes! With the wise leadership of our great Party and beloved Chairman Mao, and with the support of 600 million working people, Quyi, like all literature and art, has an infinitely wonderful and bright future. Today's buds, tomorrow's flowers, the backbone of the socialist society's Quyi cause, will surely guard against arrogance and rashness, and sing the strongest voice of the times.

    蓓蕾朵朵笑春风
    ——喜看青少年曲艺演员的表演
    沈彭年
    最近在首都举办的曲艺优秀节目汇报演出会上，涌现了不少青年曲艺演员，他们年岁不大，弹唱都好，热情洋溢地歌唱了伟大的党和毛主席、歌唱了党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社，歌唱了工农兵的当代英雄，使人对曲艺艺术感到耳目一新。更为令人兴奋的是少年曲艺演员也不少。本来曲艺艺术不是很容易掌握的，这种语言艺术要求演员唱得字正腔圆，说得口角生风，琵琶三弦要弹奏得洗练动听。培养少年曲艺演员是不容易的。大跃进大大地推动了曲艺工作，在1960年开门红的曲艺优秀节目汇报演出会上，出现了成队的红领巾，他们和佩戴着共青团团徽的青年演员站在一起，占了全体演员人数的72％。老年、中年、青年和少年，曲艺演员的四世同堂，令人喜笑颜开。从少年演员们的身上，我们看到了曲艺工作的未来的繁荣美景。
    曲艺传授徒弟能不能够多快好省，这个问题也迎刃而解。刚刚培养了一两年的小演员，能够把“赵云截江”演唱得丝丝入扣，腔调、身段，一丝不苟。不只如此，他还能够歌唱人民英雄，用新的唱腔有力地歌唱了黄继光。他也能弹弹三弦，拉拉四胡。四川清音有一对兄妹小演员，才一年多，就学会了近二十个段子。兄妹俩演唱的“小放风筝”活泼极了，小孩子唱放风筝的事，有成人演员赶不上的地方。河北省的小演员唱的乐亭大鼓“小姑贤”，能够把三个人物的神情语气演唱得清清楚楚，忽紧忽慢的节奏也掌握得比较稳而准确。少年演员们的演唱使得整个汇报演出充满了生气，洋溢着喜气。观众的称赞是很容易理解的。小演员们自己理解得更清楚，他们说能够学会一点艺术，是由于毛主席的关怀，党的培养；老师的苦心传授，广大听众的爱护支持。
    老师们常和他们谈起自己幼年学艺的悲惨经历，挨打挨骂，受冷受饿，往往学了三四年，只学会了跑东跑西，抱孩子做饭。有心眼的才“偷”到一点混饭的本领，碰见好心的老师才能够学个一知半解。因为那是教会徒弟，饿死师父的社会，老师们只好来个“师父领进门，修行在个人”了。今天的老师，孩子们也有个评价：老师爱我们如同自家的儿女。教唱是一字一句地教，教鼓板乐器是把着手教，教身段是一招一式地教。老师们忙完了自己的业务，有时忘了吃，忘了休息，立刻给学生说“活”。有的老师带着病也要坚持教学，他们说孩子的功夫一天也不能误。老师们认识到了教徒弟是在培养曲艺事业的接班人，在培养社会主义的曲艺歌手。
    老师们也常和徒弟们谈起旧社会的剧场情况。能够到园子里演唱的曲艺演员为数不多，苦处也是一言难尽。场子里乌烟瘴气、地痞流氓资本家是主要观众。初上台的小演员没有一个不是战战兢兢，胆战心寒的。一句不对，就会受到无情的哄闹，下了台就会受到毒打痛骂，苦不堪言。今天的听众把小演员也是看成自己的孩子，稍有一点好处，就热情鼓励；有一点差错，听众，劳动人民的听众，比台上还着急，对小演员们满怀着疼惜的心情。有时他们还善意地提出意见，进行帮助。
    这一切可喜现象是怎样产生的，一句话，由于我们有了优越的社会主义制度。适合向哪一方面发展的幼苗，都可以得到阳光甘露，茁壮生长，成长壮大。老师为什么和旧社会的老师不同？听众为什么有了彻底的变化？
    小朋友们回答得好：这个时代是最幸福的时代。
    对！我们有了伟大的党和敬爱的毛主席的英明领导，我们有了六亿劳动人民的护持，和一切文学艺术一样，曲艺事业就有了无限美妙光明的发展前途。今天的蓓蕾，明天的鲜花，社会主义社会曲艺事业的骨干，一定会戒骄戒躁，唱出时代的最强音。
