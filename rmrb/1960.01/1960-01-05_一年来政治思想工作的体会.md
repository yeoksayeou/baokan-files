Experiences in Political and Ideological Work Over the Past Year
Gong Tangshui, First Secretary of the Jiangxiang People's Commune Party Committee, Nanchang, Jiangxi

Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, our Jiangxiang People's Commune in Nanchang County, following the Great Leap Forward of 1958, achieved another comprehensive victory in the Great Leap Forward in 1959. The total value of agricultural, sideline, and industrial production in the commune increased by 78% compared to 1958, with total grain output increasing by 73.7%. Along with the rapid development of production, the commodity production rate increased by 1.12 times compared to 1958, and the average net income of commune members increased by 67%. At the same time, the spiritual outlook of all commune members has also undergone tremendous changes. Their revolutionary fervor has grown stronger and stronger. No matter what kind of farm work, no matter how great the difficulties, as long as the Party issues a call, cadres and the masses immediately take action and forge ahead courageously.

The tremendous achievements of our commune are a victory for the leadership of the Party and a victory for the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. Through the practice of the past year, I have gained the following deeper understanding of how to do a good job in political and ideological work in the implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines, and in the midst of the surging tide of the Great Leap Forward in production.

The Party's policies and guidelines are the embodiment of the will of the broad masses of the people, and they represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses. Therefore, once the Party's policies and guidelines are grasped by the masses, they will be transformed into infinite power. However, how can the Party's policies and guidelines be quickly implemented among the masses and transformed into concrete actions by the masses? According to my experience, first, one must first study and understand the essence of the policies and guidelines; second, one must conduct serious investigation and research, listen to the opinions of the masses, and propose practical and feasible methods and measures for implementing the Party's policies and guidelines based on the actual conditions of the region; third, one must explain the Party's policies and guidelines to the masses clearly, so that they are known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people; fourth, one must talk about political and ideological matters at every meeting, using the abstract to drive the concrete, first solving ideological problems and then solving practical problems, so that the masses can understand the Party's policies and guidelines more deeply; and fifth, in the process of implementing policies, one must always grasp the changes in people's thinking and carry out ideological exchanges in response to new situations.

Facts have proved that by doing so, the implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines can be deepened step by step, ensuring that they are always correctly implemented. The fact that our commune went from a shortage of oil to a surplus of oil in one year is a vivid example. After the establishment of the commune, the county Party committee instructed us to vigorously develop oilseed production and strive for self-sufficiency in oil. In accordance with this instruction, the commune Party committee conducted research and made a resolution based on the specific conditions of the commune: to ensure self-sufficiency in oilseeds in 1959 and strive for a surplus. After the meeting, a series of cadre telephone conferences and commune member meetings were held to explain the importance of increasing oilseed production to cadres and the masses. The vast majority of cadres and commune members supported the decision of the commune Party committee, but some people kept talking about it. Some said: We have always been an oil-deficient area, and the foundation for oilseed production is very poor. It is impossible to change the face of oil deficiency in one year. Some said: The soil here is not good, and we lack planting experience, so we cannot expand the planting of oil crops. After discovering these ideological situations, we immediately organized a commune-wide debate. The content of the debate was: Can the oil shortage be changed? How to change it? Rely on our own production or rely on national supply? Through the debate, the ideological understanding of cadres and the masses was greatly improved, and their enthusiasm for planting oil crops was boosted. As a result, the commune's plan to sow 17,000 mu of rapeseed was completed in a few days, and later, a bumper harvest was achieved. Encouraged by the bumper harvest of spring oil, the broad masses then launched a production upsurge of autumn oil surpassing spring oil, and the sowing of peanuts and sesame exceeded the original planned targets, and another bumper harvest of autumn oil was achieved. In this way, our total oil production last year reached more than 330,000 catties, which not only met all the self-sufficiency needs, but also transferred more than 70,000 catties of commercial oil to the state.

Through the practice of the past year, I have more deeply realized that in carrying out mass movements, it is necessary to continuously oppose right-leaning tendencies and encourage vigor. Only in this way can mass movements develop wave after wave. After the bumper harvest of early rice, some people in our commune developed a relaxed mood, thinking that "it doesn't matter if the late rice harvest is small since the early rice was a bumper harvest." After discovering this situation, the commune Party committee promptly conducted research and immediately issued a call to all commune members to "thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies, give full play to our vigor, and resolutely achieve a late rice harvest that surpasses the early rice harvest," encouraging commune members to advance victoriously and seize a bumper harvest of late rice. Shortly after, all commune members quickly launched a large-scale production competition to surpass the early rice harvest with the late rice harvest, and overfulfilled the sowing plan. In July and August, the late rice was again severely threatened by drought, and some people developed pessimistic sentiments and lacked the vigor to fight the drought. In response to this situation, the commune Party committee again educated the commune members, greatly encouraged their vigor, and issued a battle call to all commune members to "fight the drought to the end, overturn the rivers and seas to ensure a bumper harvest." Subsequently, the entire commune launched a movement to draw water day and night to fight the drought and ensure a bumper harvest, finally overcoming the hundred-day drought and enabling the total output of late rice to reach 53,890,000 catties, exceeding the early rice by 7,510,000 catties.

Vigorously commending the advanced is an important aspect of political and ideological work. In the past year, I have also had a deep understanding of this point. Last spring, the manure accumulation movement in the Sandong Management Area was carried out vigorously, realizing that every mu had a manure pile and every plot had a manure pit. At that time, the commune Party committee commended the Sandong Management Area and organized other management areas to visit and learn. Later, a high tide of learning from Sandong, catching up with Sandong, and surpassing Sandong immediately formed in the entire commune. Within a month, the entire commune accumulated a total of 10 million dan of manure, which was more than the amount accumulated in the past two months. In the struggle against drought, Wang Zhicao, an old commune member of the Yezhou Management Area, continuously fought the drought for 37 days, with blisters on his feet, but he still insisted on fighting. The commune Party committee then established Wang Zhicao as a model for fighting the drought and called on all commune members to learn from Wang Zhicao's vigor. As a result, the labor attendance rate in the entire commune's drought-fighting struggle reached 100% every day, and labor efficiency increased by 30%.

Using the method of "driving the overall red with one point of red" is a good way to encourage the backward to strengthen their aspirations and boost their vigor. In our work, we found that the cadres and the masses in some backward areas had some pessimistic and negative sentiments. They often lacked the confidence to strive for advancement and to strive for the upstream. In order to help them establish lofty ambitions and strengthen their aspirations, we adopted the following method: when we discovered that they had advanced things in some aspect, we promptly commended them and encouraged them to strive for overall advancement, and the effect was very good. For example, the Jiangxiang Management Area did not do well in production in the past, and some cadres and commune members pessimistically believed that no matter how hard they worked, they could not catch up with the advanced teams. However, they had a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, and the progress of storing grain purchased by the state was the fastest. The commune Party committee immediately commended their achievements in this regard and encouraged them to strive for the upstream in production. Encouraged and helped by the commune Party committee, the cadres and commune members of this management area strengthened their confidence and boosted their vigor, and finally strived for the upstream in production. Recently, this management area has been rated as an advanced management area in the entire commune.

At present, the cadres and commune members in our commune are summarizing the achievements and experiences of the past year on the one hand, and stepping up winter production on the other, preparing to realize the continued leap forward in 1960. In the new year, we are determined to strive for a 50% increase in total grain output compared to last year, and a more than double increase in the total value of agricultural, sideline, and industrial production of the entire commune and the average net income of each commune member compared to last year.

    一年来政治思想工作的体会
    江西南昌蒋巷公社党委第一书记  公堂水
    我们南昌县蒋巷公社在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，继1958年大跃进之后，1959年又取得了大跃进的全面胜利。全社农、副、工业总产值比1958年增长78％；其中粮食总产量增长73．7％。随着生产的飞速发展，商品生产率比1958年增长了一点一二倍，平均社员纯收入提高了67％。同时，全体社员的精神面貌，也发生了巨大变化，革命干劲越鼓越足，不问什么农活，不管多大困难，只要党一号召，干部和群众就立即行动起来，勇往直前。
    我们公社取得这样巨大的成绩，是党的领导的胜利，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利。通过去年的实践，我对于在贯彻党的政策方针中，在万马奔腾的生产大跃进中，如何作好政治思想工作，有如下一些较深刻的体会。
    党的方针政策，是广大人民群众意志的体现，它代表着广大群众的根本利益。因此，党的政策方针一旦被群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量。但是，如何使党的方针政策迅速贯彻到群众中去，并变成群众实际行动呢？根据我的体会，第一，自己首先要学习和领会政策方针的精神实质；第二，要认真地进行调查研究，听取群众意见，并根据本地区的实际情况，提出贯彻党的方针政策的切实可行的办法和措施；第三，要把党的方针政策向群众讲得一清二楚，做到家喻户晓，深入人心；第四，逢会就谈政治思想，以虚带实，先解决思想问题，后解决实际问题，使党的方针政策让群众领会得更加深透；第五，在贯彻政策过程中，随时掌握人们的思想变化，并针对新的情况，开展思想交锋。
    事实证明，这样做，贯彻党的方针政策就能步步深入，保证始终正确执行。我们公社一年间由缺油变成余油的事实，就是一个鲜明的例证。公社成立后，县委指示大力发展油料生产，力争油料自给。根据这一指示，公社党委会进行了研究，并根据本社的具体情况，作出决议：保证1959年油料自给，力争有余。会后，又接连召开了干部电话会，社员大会，向干部群众讲解增产油料的重要意义。绝大部分干部社员都拥护公社党委的决议，但是也有些人议论不休。有的说：我们是历来缺油地区，油料生产的基础很差，要在一年内改变缺油面貌是不可能的。有的说：我们这里的田底子不好，又缺乏种植经验，不能扩种油料作物。发现这些思想情况后，我们就立即组织了一次全社范围的大辩论，辩论的内容是：缺油的状况能否改变？怎样改变？是靠自己生产，还是靠国家供应？通过辩论，大大提高了干部和群众的思想认识，鼓起了他们种植油料作物的积极性。结果，全社播种一万七千亩油菜的计划，在几天内完成了，以后，并获得了大丰收。广大群众在春油大丰收的鼓舞下，接着又掀起了秋油超春油的生产高潮，花生、芝麻播种都突破了原来的计划指标，又获得了秋油大丰收。这样，我们去年的油脂总产量达到三十三万余斤，不仅能够全部自给，而且上调商品油脂七万余斤。
    一年来的实践，我更深刻地体会到，在大搞群众运动中必须坚持不断反右倾、鼓干劲。只有这样，群众运动才能一浪高一浪地向前发展。在早稻大丰收以后，我们公社有一部分人产生了“早稻丰收了，晚稻少收无所谓”的松劲情绪。公社党委发现这一情况后，及时进行了研究，并立即向全社社员提出了“反透右倾、鼓足干劲，坚决实现晚稻超早稻”的战斗号召，鼓舞社员乘胜前进，夺取晚稻丰收。此后不久，全社社员迅速开展了晚稻超早稻的生产大竞赛，超额完成了播种计划。7、8月间，晚稻又受到了严重干旱威胁，部分群众又产生了悲观情绪，抗旱劲头不足。针对这种情况，公社党委又对社员进行教育，大鼓干劲，向全社社员提出了“抗旱抗到底，闹翻海河保丰收”的战斗号召。接着，全社便掀起了一个日车水、夜车水的抗旱保丰收的运动，终于战胜了百日大旱，使晚稻总产量达到五千三百八十九万斤，超过早稻七百五十一万斤。
    大力表扬先进，是政治思想工作中一个重要方面。这一点，在过去的一年中，我也有着深刻的体会。去年春天，三洞管理区积肥运动搞得有声有色，实现了亩亩有粪堆、丘丘有粪窖。当时公社党委表扬了三洞管理区，并组织其他管理区来参观学习。以后，一个学三洞、赶三洞、超三洞的积肥高潮，就在全社立即形成。一个月内全社共积肥一千万担，比过去两个月积的还要多。在抗旱斗争中，业洲管理区的老社员王志操接连抗旱三十七天，脚上磨了水泡，仍然坚持战斗。公社党委便树立王志操为抗旱标兵，号召全社社员学习王志操的干劲。结果，全社抗旱斗争中的劳动出勤率天天达到100％，劳动工效提高了30％。
    运用“以一点红带动全面红”的方法，是促使后进长志气、鼓干劲的好方法。在工作中，我们发现部分后进地区的干部和群众有些悲观消极情绪，他们往往缺乏争先进、争上游的信心。为了帮助他们树雄心，长志气，我们采取了这样的方法：发现他们某一方面出现先进事物，就及时表扬，鼓励他们争取全面先进，效果很好。例如，蒋巷管理区过去生产搞得不太好，部分干部、社员消极地认为自己再努力，也赶不上先进队。但是，他们爱国热情高，征购粮入库进度最快。公社党委立即表扬了他们这方面的成绩，并鼓励他们在生产上要力争上游。在公社党委的鼓舞和帮助下，这个管理区的干部和社员增强了信心，鼓起了干劲，终于在生产上争得了上游。最近，这个管理区已被评为全社的先进管理区。
    目前，我们社里的干部、社员正在一面总结过去一年的成就和经验，一面加紧搞好冬季生产，准备实现1960年的继续跃进。在新的一年中，我们决心争取粮食总产量比去年增长50％；全社农、副、工业总产值和全社平均每个社员纯收入比去年增长一倍以上。
