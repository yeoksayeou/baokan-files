Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th: Nguyen Khon, Deputy Minister of Construction of Vietnam, said on the 15th in response to a question from a Vietnam News Agency reporter that the workload of basic construction in Vietnam in 1960 will exceed the sum of the workload in 1958 and 1959. According to the Ministry of Construction's scheduled plan, there are 110 new construction projects in 1960, of which 60 are industrial projects and 50 are civil engineering projects.

Nguyen Khon said that according to this year's plan, the projects to be completed this year include the Viet Tri power plant with a power generation capacity of 16,000 kilowatts, the Ham Rong power plant in Thanh Hoa Province, the Lao Cai apatite plant with an annual output of 500,000 tons, and a chemical plant producing chemical raw materials. Construction of the Van Dien phosphate fertilizer plant will also begin. In order to meet the growing needs of basic construction, nine building materials manufacturing plants and a large number of building materials handicraft workshops will also be built this year.

Nguyen Khon said that Vietnam will build the National Assembly Building this year, which is a construction project of great political significance.

Nguyen Khon said that North Vietnam will also build many university and vocational school buildings this year, such as the University of Engineering, Comprehensive University, Agricultural and Forestry College, Water Conservancy College, and many technical and vocational school buildings; and will expand and add a number of hospitals, resorts and sanatoriums, workers' residential areas, etc.

He said that the task of the construction department this year is to continue to maintain and improve the construction speed, attach importance to further education and training of construction personnel, improve work, and implement the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government's policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical, ensuring labor safety."

He said that the workload of basic construction design work this year is double that of 1959. All projects are required to have a higher technical level; some projects are also required to reach a certain artistic level.

In terms of urban construction planning, this year will start designing construction plans for the cities of Hanoi, Viet Tri, Thai Nguyen, Ha Dong, Nam Dinh, and Yi An, and improve the construction system of power transmission, water supply, canals, drainage ditches, streets, and parks in some cities. Due to the further development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, preliminary research work must be carried out for the formulation of rural construction plans.

    越南今年基本建设规模巨大
    将建设一百一十项工程　工作量超过以往两年总和
    新华社河内16日电　越南建筑部副部长阮昆15日在回答越南通讯社记者的问题时说，越南1960年的基本建设的工作量将超过1958年和1959年工作量的总和。据建筑部的预定计划，1960年新的建设工程有一百一十项，其中六十项是工业工程、五十项是民用工程。
    阮昆说，根据今年的计划，在今年竣工的工程有发电能力为一万六千瓩的越池发电厂，清化省咸龙发电厂，年产五十万吨的老街磷灰石厂和生产化学原料的化工厂等。文典磷肥厂也将动工兴建。为了满足基本建设日益增长的需要，今年还将动工兴建九个建筑材料制造厂和大批建筑材料手工业工场。
    阮昆说，越南今年将建筑国会大厦，这是一项具有重大政治意义的建筑工程。
    阮昆说，越南北方今年还将建筑许多高等学校和专业学校的校舍，例如建筑工科大学、综合大学、农林学院、水利学院和许多技术、专业学校的校舍；并且将扩大和增建一批医院、避暑和疗养所、工人住宅区等。
    他说，建筑部门今年的任务是，继续努力保持和提高施工速度，重视深造和培养建筑人员，改进工作，并贯彻执行越南劳动党和政府关于“多快好省、保证劳动安全”的方针。
    他说，今年的基本建设的设计工作的工作量比1959年增加一倍。各项工程都要求具有更高的技术水平；有些工程还要求达到一定的美术水平。
    在城市建设规划工作方面，今年将着手为河内、越池、太原、河东、南定、宜安等城市的建设规划进行设计，改进某些城市的输电、供水、沟渠、排水道、街道和公园的建设系统。由于农业合作化运动的进一步发展，因此必须为制订农村的建设规划进行初步的研究工作。
