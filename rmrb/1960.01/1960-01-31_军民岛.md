    Army-Civilian Island
    Gao Fangquan, Qingjiang
    Outside the Pearl River Estuary are two small islands, one garrisoned by the People's Navy, and the other inhabited by fishermen. The sailors and fishermen are of one heart and help each other; therefore, people do not call the two islands by their original names, but call them "Army-Civilian Island."
    In January of last year, the People's Commune was established on "Fishermen's Island." Upon hearing this news, the naval unit immediately selected a carpentry team, carrying axes, chisels, saws, and planes, and crossed the turbulent sea to help the commune members build a public canteen. Within a few days, the sailors made eight square tables and more than twenty wooden benches for the canteen, and also renovated the doors and windows. They also helped the commune members make two basketball hoops and repaired a bathhouse, which the commune members were very satisfied with. However, the sailors were thinking: the two female cooks in the canteen had never cooked for so many people before, and they didn't do a good job, the rice was sometimes smoky and sometimes undercooked, which needed to be resolved. The carpenters returned to the island and reported this situation, so the top chef in the naval unit—cook Xie Xihong—immediately drove a boat to "Fishermen's Island." He helped the commune members rebuild the canteen stove and signed a half-month "cooking teaching and learning contract" with the cooks, improving the fishermen's food. A few days later, the commune members praised the rice in the canteen for being fragrant.
    When "Fishermen's Island" wanted to greatly develop fishery production, the naval officers and soldiers saved 1,000 yuan to support the fishermen in expanding their production equipment, and at the same time actively helped the fishermen with construction. In June of last year, "Fishermen's Island" was building a wharf and was short of labor, so the naval unit immediately dispatched dozens of officers and soldiers to cross the sea to provide support. The officers and soldiers took off their clothes and went into the sea, soaking in the seawater, carrying stones and building seawalls, fighting the wind and waves all day long. Many people were injured, but they still gritted their teeth and persevered, completing the wharf on schedule, which facilitated fishery production. The commune members wanted to build new houses, and a whole row of officers and soldiers went to help move stones and build walls. The sailors built houses during the day and went out to sea at night to help the fishermen catch fish, catching more than 50,000 catties of fish in succession.
    The help of the naval officers and soldiers to the fishermen deeply moved the commune members. They also tried their best to support the troops. Regardless of windy or rainy weather, as long as the fishermen saw the troops' transport ship arrive, they would rush to help, as if it were their own business. One night in August of last year, the moonlight on the ocean was dim, and the wind and waves were strong. The large transport ship from the rear carrying supplies arrived at "Navy Island," but it failed to dock successfully many times. Just at this time, two fishing boats sailed from across the sea. The commune members braved the wind and waves to use fishing boats to unload materials and carry them from the dock to the barracks hundreds of meters high. The fishermen and sailors fought together for more than five hours until the materials were unloaded before setting sail again.
    The sailors and fishermen care for each other in their lives and are full of deep friendship. The fishermen go out to sea to fish day and night, and have no time to chop firewood or grow vegetables. On "Navy Island," it is difficult to chop firewood because the mountains are high and the wind is strong, and it is also difficult to grow vegetables on the island. In particular, there is very little fresh water for watering vegetables, and only a few buckets of water can be drawn from a well at a time.
    However, the sailors believed that the fisherman brothers needed firewood and vegetables more, so they took the opportunity to transport firewood and vegetables by boat. The sailors often sent messages to the commune members saying: Whenever you need it, come to the island to get it! Every time the fishermen returned from fishing, they picked the fattest and most delicious fresh fish and sent them to "Navy Island" basket by basket. When the sailors got up early in the morning, they often found baskets of fresh fish on the dock, which were left quietly by the fishing boats when they sailed by at night.
    The sailors and fishermen often "visit relatives." When a boat from "Navy Island" docked, the fishermen, men, women, old and young, ran down to the dock, helping the sailors ashore. Sailor Wu Ruihuan once came to "Fishermen's Island," but unexpectedly his old illness relapsed and he had to stay on the island. Many cadres and commune members came to visit him. An old fisherman's grandmother took care of him several times a night, bringing water and feeding him, just like treating her own son. The fishermen also often went to the neighboring island to visit the sailors.
    Recently, we visited "Army-Civilian Island." During the day, we saw the sailors and fishermen jointly driving boats out to sea and working together in production; at night, we saw the fishermen carrying rifles, guarding the coast alongside the sailors. The fishermen and sailors unite and cooperate, fully demonstrating the close relationship between the army and the people.

    军民岛
    高方全  清江
    珠江口外有两个小岛，一个岛上驻守着人民海军，一个岛上住着渔民。水兵和渔民心心相连，互相帮助，因此，人们不叫两岛的本来名称，而称它们为“军民岛”。
    去年1月，“渔民岛”上成立了人民公社。海军部队听到这一消息后，立刻选派了一个木工组，带着斧、凿、锯、刨，穿过波涛汹涌的海面，去帮助社员修盖公共食堂。几天内水兵们为食堂制造了八张方桌和二十多个木凳，还把门窗修饰一新。他们还帮助社员做了两个篮球架，修理了一座洗澡房，社员们非常满意。但是，水兵们却思量着：食堂的两个女炊事员过去没有煮过这么多人的饭，侍弄不好，米饭时而串烟，时而夹生，该帮助解决。木工们回岛反映了这一情况，于是海军部队里头等的厨师——炊事员谢锡洪，立刻驾船赶到“渔民岛”。他帮助社员改砌了食堂的炉灶，跟炊事员订立了半个月的“做饭包教保学合同”，改善渔民的伙食。几天后，社员们都夸讲食堂的米饭做得喷喷香。
    当“渔民岛”要大大发展渔业生产的时候，海军官兵们又节约了一千元，支援渔民扩充生产设备，同时积极帮助渔民进行建设。去年6月，“渔民岛”要修造码头，缺少劳力，海军部队立即抽调了几十名官兵跨海支援。官兵们脱衣下海，浸泡在海水里，扛石头，垒海堤，终日与风浪搏斗。许多人身上受了伤，仍然咬牙坚持，如期建成了码头，便利了渔业生产。社员们要建造新房屋，一个整排的官兵又去帮助搬石块，砌墙壁。水兵白天盖房，夜间还出海帮助渔民捕鱼，先后捕鱼五万多斤。
    海军官兵对渔民的帮助，使社员深受感动。他们也想尽办法来支援部队。不管风天雨天，渔民们只要看到部队的运输船来到，就连忙驾船来帮忙，好像办自己家里的事一样。去年8月的一天夜晚，海洋上月色昏暗，风急浪涌。后方运送给养的大运输船来到“海军岛”，多次靠码头都没有成功。正当这个时候，两只渔船隔海驶来。社员们冒着风浪用渔船抢卸物资，并从码头上扛送到几百米高处的营房里去。渔民协同水兵奋战了五个多小时，直到物资卸完，才重新扬帆出海。
    水兵和渔民在生活上互相关切，充满了深情厚谊。渔民日夜出海捕鱼，没有时间打柴和种菜。“海军岛”上由于山高风急，长不起一棵大树，打柴也很困难。岛上种蔬菜也不易成活。特别是浇菜的淡水很少，一口井里一次只能打几担水。
    但是，水兵们认为渔民兄弟更需要干柴和青菜，所以有机会就用船把柴和菜运送过去。水兵们还经常带信给社员们说：你们什么时候需要，什么时候就到岛上来拿吧！渔民每次捕鱼回来，都挑拣最肥美的鲜鱼，一筐一筐地送到“海军岛”上。水兵们清晨起床后，经常发现码头上放着满筐鲜鱼，那都是渔船夜间驶过时，悄悄地留下的。
    水兵们和渔民们时常往来“走亲戚”。“海军岛”来船靠岸时，渔民男女老少都跑下码头，你搀我扶地接水兵登岸。水兵吴瑞环有一次来到“渔民岛”，不料旧病复发，只得留宿岛上，许多干部和社员都来探望他。一位渔民老奶奶一夜照看几回，又端水，又喂饭，犹如对待自己的亲生儿子。渔民们也时常到邻岛看望水兵。
    最近，我们访问了“军民岛”。白天看见水兵们与渔民共同驾船出海，携手生产；夜间看到渔民挂着步枪，与水兵并肩守卫海防。渔民和水兵团结合作，充分显示了军民之间的亲密关系。
