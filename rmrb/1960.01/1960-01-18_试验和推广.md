    From the Newspaper Digest:
    Tool reform is an extremely important step in the process of technical innovation and technical revolution. To do a good job in tool reform, two key links must be grasped: one is experimentation, and the other is promotion. The effectiveness of tool reform is closely related to these two links. However, judging from the current situation, some places have not grasped these two links well enough. Some have focused on experimentation but neglected promotion. Others have done the opposite, rushing to promote without proper experimentation, resulting in detours.
    Tool reform must go through experimentation. Creating a new tool requires experimentation, and promoting a new tool also requires experimentation.
    Any new tool, from conception and design to manufacturing and application, goes through a process. In this process, human understanding must be continuously deepened through practice, and the subjective and objective gradually become consistent. Here, experimentation is practice. Only through repeated experiments can we determine whether the designed new tool is perfect and effective. Experimentation inevitably involves failure, but more importantly, we can find ways to improve from failure, turning failure into success.
    Promotion also requires experimentation. This is because experimentation can serve as a typical demonstration and resolve some incorrect understandings. People generally value practical results. "Especially the peasant masses, who always understand problems from what they see and experience personally." (Liu Shaoqi: "On the Party") Through experimentation, we can use vivid facts to convince the masses, dispel their doubts about new tools, and facilitate promotion.
    The other link in tool reform is promotion. Promotion is an important indicator of the success of tool reform. After any new tool is created and invented, it can only create new productive forces and promote the development of production if it is used extensively in production, combining people with advanced tools. Therefore, to measure the success of tool reform, we must not only look at how many creations and inventions there are, but also at the extent to which these creations and inventions are promoted. Some people are enthusiastic about creation and invention, and this spirit is very good. In creation and invention, it is entirely necessary to strive for experimentation to make new tools more perfect. However, we cannot just experiment without promoting. No matter how good the creations and inventions are, if they only remain at the experimental stage, they cannot play a role in production, nor can they continue to improve in production.
    Promotion, in another sense, is practice on a larger scale, so it can further test and improve tools. Problems that a few people did not discover in individual experiments may be discovered by the broad masses in large-scale promotion. And the broad masses, in the process of promotion, will surely use their own wisdom and experience to supplement the imperfections of the original advanced tools, making them more perfect and more advanced. As Chairman Mao said: "Discover truth through practice, and then verify and develop truth through practice."
    Experimentation and promotion are two complementary aspects. The purpose of experimentation is promotion, and the premise of promotion is experimentation. Therefore, when experimenting with new tools, we must consider the issue of future promotion. Specifically, we must start from production and from the actual situation of the local area. Some new tools that have been successfully trial-produced are often limited in their promotion because they neglect this point, resulting in high costs, difficult-to-find materials, and complex technology. At the same time, promotion should also be carried out on the premise of successful experimentation. A truly successful new tool should not only be efficient, but also be inexpensive, easy to find materials for, and simple to make. In the past few years, we have successfully trial-produced many new tools, but some have not been seriously promoted. Therefore, in the future, while continuing to vigorously create new tools, we need to pay special attention to the issue of promotion.
    The process of experimentation and promotion in tool reform is an infinite cycle and continuous advancement of practice, knowledge, re-practice, and re-knowledge. In this process, we can not only continuously improve tools, continuously improve labor productivity, and develop production, achieving the goal of transforming the objective world; but also continuously transform ourselves and transform our subjective world. Each process of practice and knowledge makes tools more advanced and knowledge more profound. (Excerpt from Shen Zhengyan's article in the first issue of Anhui's "Emptiness and Reality" in 1960)

### 试验和推广

    试验和推广
    工具改革是技术革新和技术革命过程中一个极为重要的步骤。搞好工具改革必须抓住两个环节：一是试验；一是推广。工具改革的成效如何，都和这两个环节密切的联系着。但是就当前的情况来看，有些地方对这两个环节却抓得不够好。有的抓紧了试验，忽略了推广。有的正好相反，没有搞好试验，就急于推广，结果走了弯路。
    工具改革一定要经过试验。创造一件新工具要经过试验，推广一件新工具同样要经过试验。
    任何新工具从构思、设计到制成、运用，都有一个过程。在这个过程中，要通过实践使人的认识不断深化，主观和客观逐渐取得一致。在这里，试验也就是实践。只有经过反复的试验，才能断定所设计的新工具是否完善、是否管用。试验免不了会失败，而更重要的是从失败中可以找出改进的途径，使失败转化为成功。
    推广也需要经过试验，这是因为试验可以起典型示范作用，解决一些不正确认识。因为人一般是重视实际效果的，“特别是农民群众，总是从亲自看到的，亲自体验到的事情上去理解问题。”（刘少奇：“论党”）经过试验，就可以用活生生的事实说服群众，扫除他们对新工具的疑虑，有利于推广。
    工具改革的另一个环节是推广。推广是衡量工具改革成绩的重要标志。任何新工具创造发明出来以后，只有大量使用于生产，使人和先进的工具结合起来，才能造成新的生产力，推进生产的发展。所以说衡量工具改革成绩的大小，不仅要看有多少创造发明，而且还要看这些创造发明推广的程度。有些人热心于创造发明，这种精神是很好的。在创造发明中，力求经过试验，使新工具更完善些，这也是完全必要的。但是不能只试验不推广。创造发明搞得再好，如果只是停留在试验的阶段，那就不能在生产中发挥作用，也不能在生产中继续提高。
    推广在另一个意义上讲，它是更大规模上的实践，所以它又能进一步检验和改进工具。在个别试验中少数人没有发现的问题，有可能在大规模的推广中被广大群众所发现，并且广大群众在推广过程中，一定会用自己的智慧、经验，来补充原来先进工具不完善的地方，使它更加完善、更加先进。正如毛主席说的：“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理和发展真理。”
    试验和推广是相辅相成的两个方面。试验的目的是推广，推广的前提是试验。因此试验新工具的时候，就要考虑到将来的推广问题。具体地说，就是从生产出发，从当地的实际情况出发。有些试制成功的新工具，往往由于忽视了这一点，因而造价昂贵，材料难找，技术复杂，使推广受到一定限制。同时，推广也要在试验成功的前提下进行。一件真正成功的新工具，不仅应该效率高，而且应该造价低廉，材料好找，简便易作。几年来我们试制成功的新工具很多，有些还没有认真推广，因此今后需要在继续大力创造新工具的同时，特别重视推广的问题。
    工具改革中的试验和推广的过程，也就是实践、认识、再实践、再认识的无限循环和不断前进的过程。在这个过程中，不仅可以不断地改进工具，不断地提高劳动生产率，发展生产，达到改造客观世界的目的；而且还能不断地改造我们自己，改造我们的主观世界。每一个实践、认识的过程，都使工具更加进步，认识更加深化。（摘自安徽“虚与实”1960年第一期沈正言文）
