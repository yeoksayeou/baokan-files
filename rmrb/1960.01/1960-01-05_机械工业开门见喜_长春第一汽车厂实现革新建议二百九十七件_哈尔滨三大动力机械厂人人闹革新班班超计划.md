Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 3rd: The Changchun First Automobile Factory achieved an all-round victory on the first working day of this year. On January 3rd, the entire factory completed its daily work plan half an hour ahead of schedule, with output and total production value increasing by 29% and 19.5% respectively compared to the average daily production level in December of last year. On this day, the factory's attendance rate reached 99%, and safe production was achieved.

Before the New Year, the factory's employees made full preparations for a flying start to this year's production. Each workshop, department, team, and individual worker formulated plans for a successful start. On the 3rd, as soon as work began, the workers in each workshop launched technical innovation activities focused on key aspects of production, implementing 297 technical innovation proposals, including eleven major innovations. The gear and axle department of the engine workshop achieved its "everyone contributes a treasure" plan for a flying start. Veteran worker Yu Qinglian improved the lathe processing method, increasing the shift output of the lathe he operated by two-thirds.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 4th: The workers of Harbin's three major power machinery plants—電機 (Electrical Machinery), 鍋爐 (Boiler), and 汽輪機 (Steam Turbine)—are all engaging in innovation, and every shift is exceeding its plan, setting new production records on the first day of production after the New Year (January 2nd).

On this day, the Harbin電機 (Electrical Machinery) Plant's daily output value exceeded the average daily output value of December last year by 113.4%. The medium-sized motor, steam turbine generator, and water turbine workshops all exceeded their daily output value plans by 6% to 53%. The 鍋爐 (Boiler) Plant's daily output value exceeded the average daily output value of December last year by 56%. Eight workshops, seventy-five teams, and one thousand eight hundred and thirty-five workers exceeded their daily plans by one to more than ten times. The 汽輪機 (Steam Turbine) Plant also exceeded its daily output value plan.

The motors, boilers, steam turbines, and other products produced by Harbin's three major power machinery plants are all large-scale products, with production cycles often exceeding one month. According to past practice, products generally would not be produced until the end of the first month or the second month of the year. Due to good production preparation, the Harbin電機 (Electrical Machinery) Plant produced five DC motors on the first day of work after the New Year. The Harbin鍋爐 (Boiler) Plant produced one Lancashire boiler on the first day of work. Both factories will produce several large-scale products in January. The Harbin汽輪機 (Steam Turbine) Plant will produce two 25,000 and 50,000 kilowatt steam turbines in the first ten days of January.

    机械工业开门见喜
    长春第一汽车厂实现革新建议二百九十七件
    哈尔滨三大动力机械厂人人闹革新班班超计划
    据新华社长春3日电　长春第一汽车制造厂今年的第一个工作日生产全面告捷。元月3日，全厂提前半小时全面完成了日作业计划，产量和生产总值分别比去年12月的平均日产水平提高29％和19．5％。这一天，全厂出勤率达99％，并且做到了安全生产。
    这个厂的职工在年前就为今年生产开门红作了充分的准备。各车间、工部、小组和每个工人，都制订了开门红的规划。3日一上班，各车间职工便针对生产中关键展开了技术革新活动，实现了大小技术革新建议二百九十七件，其中有重大革新十一项。发动机车间齿轴工部实现了“每人献宝一条”的开门红计划，老工人于清连改进了车床加工方法，使他操作的车床的班产量提高三分之二。
    据新华社哈尔滨4日电　哈尔滨电机、锅炉、汽轮机三大动力机械厂的职工人人闹革新，班班超计划，在新年开工生产的第一天（1月2日）就刷新了生产纪录。
    这一天，哈尔滨电机厂日产值超过去年12月份平均日产值113．4％，中型电机、汽轮发电机、水轮机等车间都超额6％到53％完成了日产值计划。锅炉厂日产值超过去年12月平均日产值56％，有八个车间、七十五个小组、一千八百三十五个工人，都是一倍到十几倍地超额完成了当天计划。汽轮机厂也超额完成了日产值计划。
    哈尔滨三大动力机械厂生产的电机、锅炉、汽轮机等，都是大型产品，生产周期多在一个月以上。按照往年惯例，一般都要在开年第一月的月末或第二个月才能出产品。哈尔滨电机厂由于生产准备得好，新年开工的第一天就生产出五台直流电机。哈尔滨锅炉厂在开工的第一天就生产出一台兰克夏锅炉。这两个厂在1月份内都将出几台大型产品。哈尔滨汽轮机厂在1月上旬就要生产出两台二万五千和五万瓩的汽轮机。
