Water Conservancy Projects Must Pass the Supporting Facilities Test
By People's Daily Commentator

On December 30th of last year, this newspaper, in its editorial "Organize a Major Inspection of Water Conservancy Projects," proposed that water conservancy projects must pass seven tests, one of which was the engineering supporting facilities test. The reason for emphasizing the importance of passing the engineering supporting facilities test is to ensure that all water conservancy projects can benefit while under construction, be completed early, and benefit early.

The purpose of water conservancy construction is to meet the water requirements of crops, to reduce or eliminate the threat of natural disasters such as floods and droughts to crops, and to ensure stable agricultural production increases. From the perspective of water conservancy construction in various regions this year, many places have done a good job in terms of building more and building faster, which is of course very good. However, this is only one aspect; another aspect must be to build well. One sign of building well is: quick benefit, high efficiency. How can we achieve quick benefit and high efficiency? The key is to make the project complete, achieving reservoir completion with canal connection, and water reaching flat land. That is to say, when building water conservancy projects, not only should a series of water source projects such as water storage, water diversion, or water lifting be built well to solve the problem of water sources, but also branch canals, secondary canals, and field canals should be dug well, and the land leveled well, so that reservoir construction, canal digging, land leveling, and land preparation are completed in one go, maximizing benefits. Any water conservancy project is composed of large and small projects, and if one project is not done well, it will affect the full utilization of the entire project. For example, if a reservoir is to play the role of irrigation and drought and flood prevention, it is necessary not only to build the main dam and secondary dams, but also to build spillways, control gates, culverts, canals, and field ditches, as well as leveling the land, etc. If only the main project of the reservoir is built well, but the auxiliary projects are not built well, then even if the reservoir stores water, without canals, the water cannot be diverted to the fields; without field ditches and leveled land, the water, even if it reaches the fields, cannot irrigate the crops in a timely and appropriate manner, failing to play its due role. Such reservoirs, with incomplete projects, cannot be considered well-built, no matter how many are built or how quickly they are built. Therefore, when building water conservancy projects, it is imperative to make the project complete.

During the large-scale water conservancy campaign in 1958, due to a lack of experience, insufficient attention was paid to the supporting facilities of water conservancy projects, resulting in some incomplete projects. Some had reservoirs built without canals; some had main and branch canals built without secondary and field canals; some had canals built, but the land was not leveled well. These projects could not benefit in the same year or had low efficiency, failing to play their due role in agricultural production. In last year's winter water conservancy campaign, many regions have learned this lesson, conducting unified planning and comprehensive arrangements for the large and small projects of water conservancy, grasping both the main project and the auxiliary projects; and also using the past experience of building and using simultaneously, building quickly and using quickly, building well and using well, to achieve timely benefits, and the results have been very good. For example, Beijing Municipality, to date, has reached an irrigated area of three million mu after new modifications and improvements, of which the area with complete canal systems has reached 2.48 million mu. For the area that is not yet complete, the projects above the main and branch canals have been basically completed, and the supporting projects below the secondary canals are continuing to be carried out on a large scale. In Jin County, Liaoning Province, from the beginning of last winter's construction, following the guiding principle of combining main projects and auxiliary projects, linking them together, and grasping both water source projects and supporting projects, the county party secretary took the lead in formulating a supporting plan for water conservancy projects, implementing it layer by layer, and contracting the projects to the end. After a period of hard work, by the beginning of December last year, the area controlled by newly built, renovated, and expanded canals and field projects reached more than 53,600 mu, of which more than 20,000 mu had already been put into winter irrigation. Even large-scale water conservancy projects can completely pass the supporting facilities test. For example, several large-scale Yellow River diversion projects built in Henan and Shandong provinces in the winter of 1958 are large irrigation areas irrigating millions or even tens of millions of mu. Because attention was paid to the completeness of the projects, they benefited in the same year and played a huge role in the drought resistance in the summer of 1959. These situations show that as long as there is unified planning and comprehensive arrangement of large and small project items, and labor is properly organized, both large-scale and medium- and small-scale projects can achieve project completeness and timely benefits.

How can we achieve the completion of main projects and auxiliary projects in one go? From the current situation, the following tasks should be done well:

Unified planning and comprehensive arrangement is the primary issue. Therefore, an inspection of this work should be carried out immediately to see if the existing plans and arrangements are correct and meet the requirements. If the planning is not good, we must quickly find out the reasons and think of ways to do it well, and we must ensure that both the main project and the auxiliary projects can be completed with high quality and high speed. If there is no unified planning and comprehensive arrangement for the main project and auxiliary projects, arrangements should be made quickly, and action should be taken immediately. Otherwise, the role of water conservancy projects cannot be brought into play as soon as possible.

After there is planning and arrangement, the most important work is to reasonably arrange and organize labor. The auxiliary projects with the largest workload, widest scope, and greatest need for labor are canal digging and land preparation, so it is necessary to properly arrange labor to ensure that both the main project and auxiliary projects can be completed on schedule or ahead of schedule. When arranging and organizing labor, you can rank according to time, labor, and the difficulty and size of the project, and adopt the method of dividing battle lines, contracting by item, or contracting by area under unified leadership. In this way, both ends can be taken care of, and it can be carried out simultaneously from top to bottom. Fan County, Shandong Province, divided the large army for water conservancy construction into "field corps" and "local corps." The former is directly guided by the county and is responsible for building large canals, while the latter is controlled by the commune and is responsible for repairing branch canals, secondary canals, field canals, and field projects. Some communes have already completed branch canals, secondary canals, field canals, and field projects, and have realized garden-like fields, which can be irrigated at any time. Jin County, Liaoning Province, adopted the method of each commune contracting a complete set of projects and repairing them to the end, and also, according to the characteristics of winter construction with the ground freezing, determined to first complete the small supporting facilities of the unit project, and concentrate on completing the water source project and canal project; after the spring thaw, combined with land leveling, comprehensively do a good job of field projects and complete the large supporting facilities. In addition, in terms of arranging labor, some places have taken the following measures: concentrating a part of the strong labor force to fight against reservoirs, river dams, and build key projects such as trunk canals; another part of the labor force carries out branch canals, secondary canals, field canals, and field projects, combined with soil improvement and field management, and simultaneously excavates ditches and levels ridges; or adopts the method of breaking through one by one, making persistent efforts, and being responsible to the end.

For auxiliary projects such as branch canals, secondary canals, field canals, and land leveling, not only must labor be arranged and allocated to carry them out, but also the requirements of "high speed, high quality, and high work efficiency" must be implemented, so that they can correspond to the water source project and be completed in one go, and can guarantee the timely realization of benefits. How can we achieve high speed, high quality, and high work efficiency? The key issue is still to carry out technological reforms on a large scale to improve construction efficiency. At present, some areas have adopted tractors to tow canal digging and land leveling, large blasting to build canals, etc., which are all good methods and can be applied locally. For small buildings on canals, temporary measures can also be taken simply, first seeking usability and then seeking improvement. Land leveling is the same, you can first do small squares, small levels, and then gradually do large squares, large levels. Canal projects should be large and small systems, with canals for irrigation, roads for drainage, smooth water flow, no collapse or leakage, no scouring or siltation; land preparation should be able to make water easy to access and irrigation even.

To ensure that water conservancy projects play their role in a timely manner, in addition to grasping the supporting facilities of the project, it is also necessary to do a good job in organizing and managing work in a timely manner. Before the completion of the project, organizational management agencies should be established and full-time management personnel should be determined. Because this water conservancy campaign is very large in scale and there are many water conservancy projects, a group of management personnel should be trained now in conjunction with construction, so that they can understand the construction situation of the project and master a set of methods for managing and using the project, so that they can serve agricultural production well and achieve significant benefits after the completion of the project.

Finally, to do a good job of main projects such as reservoir construction and dam construction and auxiliary projects such as canal digging and land preparation at the same time, in one go, so that water conservancy projects are complete and can play their role in a timely manner, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, so that everyone participating in water conservancy construction can establish a clear idea of continuing to leap forward in service of agricultural production, and strive to ensure that most of the projects built can benefit in the same year and play a huge role in the continued leap forward of agriculture in 1960.

    水利工程一定要过好配套关
    本报评论员
    去年12月30日，本报在“组织一次水利工程大检查”的社论中，曾经提出水利工程要通过七道关口，其中有一道就是工程配套关。所以这样强调过好工程配套关，是为了所有水利工程都能做到边施工，边受益，早完工，早受益。
    兴修水利的目的，是为了满足农作物对水的要求，是为了减免水、旱等自然灾害对农作物的威胁，保证农业稳定增产。从今年各地兴修水利的情况来看，许多地方在施工方面都做到了修得多，修得快，这当然是很好的。但是这只是一个方面，另一个方面还必须做到修得好。修得好的一个标志是：受益快，效益高。怎样才能做到受益快，效益高呢？关键的问题就是要使工程成套，做到库成渠通、水到地平。也就是说，在修水利工程的时候，既要把蓄水、引水或提水等一系列的水源工程修建好，解决水的来源问题，同时还要把支渠、斗渠、毛渠开好，土地平整好，使修库、开渠、平地、整地一气呵成，发挥最大效益。不论任何一个水利工程，都是由大大小小的工程构成的，一项工程搞得不好，就要影响到整个工程充分发挥作用。比如一个水库要发挥灌溉和防旱、防涝的作用，就不仅要修主体大坝和副坝，而且还要修溢洪道、节制闸、涵洞、渠道和田间沟渠，还要平整土地等等。如果光修好了水库的主体工程，而不修好辅助工程，那末，水库即使蓄上了水，没有渠道，水也引不到田里去；没有田间沟渠和平整土地，水到了田里，也不能适时适量地浇灌农作物，发挥应有的作用。这样工程不成套的水库，即使修得再多，修得再快，也不能算作修得好。因此，在修建水利工程的时候，一定要使工程成套。
    在1958年大兴水利运动中，因为缺少经验，对水利工程的配套问题注意得不够，以致一部分工程没有成套。有的是修了水库，没有修水渠；有的是修了干支渠道，没有修斗、毛渠；有的是虽然修了渠道，但土地没有平整好，这些工程都不能在当年受益或者效益不高，对农业生产没有起到应有的作用。去年的冬修水利运动中，不少地区已接受了这个教训，对水利工程的大小项目进行了统一规划、全面安排，既抓主体工程，也抓辅助工程；并且在修建中还运用了过去一些边修边用、快修快用、修好用好等及时发挥效益的经验，因此，效果很好。例如北京市到目前为止，经过新修改善，灌溉面积已经达到三百万亩，其中渠系成套的面积达到二百四十八万亩，尚未成套的面积，干支渠以上的工程已基本完成，正继续大搞斗渠以下的配套工程。辽宁省锦县在去年冬修一开始，就本着主要工程和辅助工程相结合，环环相套的施工指导原则，一手抓水源工程，一手抓配套工程，由县委书记挂帅，制定水利工程配套计划，层层落实，包修到底。经过前一阶段的奋战，到去年12月初，完成新修、整修、扩建的渠道和田间工程控制面积达五万三千六百多亩，其中已有两万多亩投入冬灌。就是大型水利工程也完全可以过好配套关。如河南、山东两省1958年冬季修建的几处大型引黄工程，是灌溉几百万亩甚至上千万亩的大灌区，因为注意了工程成套，就做到了当年受益，在1959年的夏季抗旱中，发挥了巨大作用。这些情况说明，只要统一规划，全面安排大小工程项目，妥善地组织劳力，不论是大型还是中、小型工程，都能够做到工程成套、及时受益。
    怎样才能做到主体工程和辅助工程一气呵成呢？从目前的情况看来应当做好以下几项工作：
    统一规划，全面安排，是首要的问题。因此，应对这一工作立即进行一次检查，已有的规划、安排是不是正确，是不是合乎要求。如果规划得不好的，就要赶快找出原因、想出办法做好，一定要使主体工程和辅助工程都能高质量高速度地完成。如果还没有对主体工程和辅助工程作统一规划和全面安排的，要赶快作出安排，并且立即行动起来。否则，就不能尽快地发挥水利工程的作用。
    在已经有了规划和安排之后，最重要的工作就是合理安排和组织劳动力。辅助工程中工作量最大、范围最广、需要劳力最多的是开渠、整地工作，因此，需要妥善地安排劳力，才能保证主体工程和辅助工程都能按期或提前完成。在安排、组织劳力时，可以根据时间、劳力和工程的难易、大小进行排队，在统一领导下采取划分战线，分项包干或分片包干的办法。这样就可以首尾兼顾，从上到下，同时进行。山东省范县把兴修水利的大军分为“野战兵团”和“地方兵团”，前者由县直接指导，负责修建大渠道，后者由公社掌握，包修支、斗、毛渠道和田间工程；现在有些公社已经做好了支、斗、毛渠和田间工程，并实现了园田化，随时可以浇地。辽宁省锦县采取了各社成套包、成套修，一包到底的办法，还根据冬季施工大地封冻的特点，确定先作好单位工程的小配套，突击完成水源工程和渠道工程；开春解冻后，结合平整土地，全面作好田间工程，完成大配套。此外，在安排劳力上，还有些地方，采取以下的措施：集中一部分精壮劳力大战水库，拦河闸坝，修建干渠等关键工程；另外一部分劳力进行支、斗、毛渠及田间工程，结合改良土壤和田间管理工作，同时开挖沟渠、平地整畦等；或者采取逐个击破，一鼓作气，负责到底的办法。
    对于支、斗、毛渠和平地整畦等辅助工程，不但要安排调配劳力进行，而且同样要贯彻“高速度、高质量、高工效”的要求，这样才能和水源工程首尾相应、一气呵成，才能保证及时发挥效益。怎样才能作到高速度、高质量、高工效呢？关键问题仍然是大搞技术改革，提高施工效率。目前有些地区采取了拖拉机牵引开渠整地，大爆破修筑渠道等，都是好办法，可以因地制宜加以运用。对于渠道上的小型建筑物，还可因陋就简采取临时措施，先求能用，再求提高。平整土地也是一样，可以先小方、小平，再逐步大方、大平。渠道工程要做到大小成系统，灌水有渠，排水有路，水流通畅，不垮不漏，不冲不淤；整地工作要能做到上水容易，浇地均匀。
    要保证水利工程及时发挥效益，除了要抓好工程配套以外，还必须及时作好组织管理工作。在工程竣工前，就应该着手组织管理机构，确定专职管理人员。由于这次水利运动规模很大，水利工程数量很多，应当从现在起，就结合施工培训一批管理人员，使他们了解工程兴修的情况，能掌握一套管理使用工程的办法，以便工程完工后就能很好地为农业生产服务，效益显著。
    最后，要把修库、筑坝等主体工程和开渠、整地等辅助工程同时做好，一气呵成，使水利工程配套成龙，及时发挥效益，必须加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，使每一个参加兴修水利的人，都能树立起明确的为农业生产继续跃进服务的思想，争取所修的工程，绝大部分能够当年受益，在1960年的农业继续跃进中发挥巨大威力。
