    Learn to Walk on "Two Legs"
    Wang Pingyi
    Since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, Hangzhou has implemented a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, and socialist construction has achieved unprecedented and comprehensive leaps forward. The facts of the past few years have proven that the set of "walking on two legs" policies proposed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is the only way to achieve high-speed development of the national economy.
    In implementing the policy of giving equal importance to heavy and light industries, large, medium and small enterprises, and both foreign and indigenous methods, there have also been disputes. The dispute over the relationship between heavy and light industries was most prominent during the large-scale iron and steel production campaign. Some comrades shouted, "Taking steel as the key link cannot drive everything, but only overwhelm everything," and "It's easy to be a marshal, but difficult to be a soldier." Some comrades negated the role of "small-scale indigenous groups," saying that engaging in small-scale indigenous methods "is costly, wasteful, and not worth the loss," and "is seeking quick success and instant benefit." These arguments are completely wrong. Since 1958, precisely because we have taken steel as the key link, grasping both heavy and light industries, we have seen a comprehensive leap forward. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the average annual growth rate of heavy industry in Hangzhou was 38%, and that of light industry was 13%. In contrast, compared with 1957, heavy industry grew by 2.2 times in 1958, and light industry grew by 1.1 times. The double leap forward of heavy and light industries fully proves the correctness of the policy of giving equal importance to heavy and light industries. Wanting only large and not small, only foreign and not indigenous, one-sidedly seeking large-scale, foreign, complete, and new things, and walking on only one leg, often leads nowhere. The two different approaches and different results in the construction process of the Hai Chao Rubber Factory are obvious examples. When this factory was first being prepared for construction, some comrades believed that a rubber factory was a "chemical industry" and should look the part. They expected large factories, foreign equipment, and a decent office. They ran around for four months and achieved nothing. Later, they changed their approach. Without new machines, they repaired and patched up ten old machines. Without an inner tube compressor, they obtained a scrapped machine from the Shanghai Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory and, after seventy days of hard work, produced tires. In 1958 and 1959, precisely because we adopted poor methods, we quickly set up thousands of factories. The output value of these factories accounts for about 30% of the industrial output value growth of Hangzhou in the past two years. It is conceivable that without so many factories put into production, it would be impossible to develop industry at a high speed. These vivid facts, especially the great power of the "small-scale indigenous groups" in the large-scale iron and steel production campaign, have profoundly educated us that we must not underestimate the great role of "small-scale indigenous groups" and "small-scale foreign groups."
    In developing industrial production, there is also a dispute regarding the issue of newly built, expanded enterprises and the potential power of existing enterprises. Some comrades only think about building new and expanding existing enterprises, without exploring the potential of enterprises. They say: "After years of leap forward, the potential has been almost fully tapped." "Without increasing equipment and building new factories, it is impossible to increase production." Of course, building new and expanding existing enterprises is an important aspect of expanded reproduction, but has the potential of existing enterprises really been fully tapped? The fact is not so. Last year, in order to increase its daily output from 200 boxes to 350 boxes in the fourth quarter, some people in the Hangzhou Liqun Cigarette Factory initially wanted to increase workers, expand the factory, and add equipment, but after mobilizing the masses to carry out technical innovations, the daily output increased to 350 boxes, and the highest day reached 390 boxes. Not only did the number of personnel not increase, but it also decreased by more than 100 people. The same is true for other factories. The substantial increase in the total industrial output value of Hangzhou in the past three years, 70% was obtained by tapping the potential of enterprises. From this number, it can be fully seen how great the role of tapping the potential of enterprises is in increasing production! If only the one leg of building new and expanding existing enterprises is used, while the other leg of tapping potential is neglected, the speed of production development will inevitably be delayed.
    All these examples show that walking on two legs can achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results; walking on one leg will inevitably lead to fewer, slower, worse, and more expensive results. In all departments and all work, there is the issue of "walking on two legs." As long as we learn and are good at using two legs to walk, we can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses and develop socialist construction at a high speed. However, in any case, one aspect of "two legs" is always the main one. For example, for developing local industry, in general, it should be based on small and medium-sized enterprises, and implement a combination of foreign and indigenous methods as the main approach; for developing agriculture, it should be based on grain, and give equal importance to grain and animal husbandry; for developing animal husbandry, it should give equal importance to public and private raising, with public raising as the main approach, and so on. Therefore, giving equal importance does not mean that there is no primary or secondary importance, just as walking on two legs has a first and a last. When we implement the policy of "walking on two legs," we must specifically analyze the situation and distinguish between the first, last, primary, and secondary.
    In implementing the policy of "walking on two legs," it is also necessary to appropriately and correctly handle the relationship between large and small, foreign and indigenous, and popularization and improvement. Some comrades also believe that since "small-scale indigenous groups" have great vitality, it is enough to popularize "small-scale indigenous groups" and there is no need to develop "small-scale foreign groups" or "medium-scale foreign groups" anymore. They are only satisfied with the status quo, do not want to improve, fail to popularize what should be popularized, and fail to improve what should be improved. This fixed and unchanging view is not comprehensive. Facts have proven that continuous improvement from indigenous to foreign is the inevitable process of social production development. Everything indigenous will inevitably develop in the direction of foreign, and everything foreign grows on the basis of indigenous. Therefore, from a development point of view, being satisfied with "small-scale indigenous groups" and not wanting to improve will not lead to more, faster, better, and more economical results, and is therefore also wrong. Modern science and technology are changing rapidly. Not only do indigenous and small things need to be improved, but foreign and large things also need to be improved. For example, the technical equipment of the Zhejiang Linen Textile Factory was advanced when it was first established nationwide, but it is no longer advanced today. This factory is now working on technical transformation. From this, we also understand that the so-called large and small, foreign and indigenous, popularization and improvement are interdependent, interconnected, and mutually transformable. There is foreign in indigenous, indigenous in foreign, improvement in popularization, and popularization in improvement. Continuously popularizing and continuously improving, in this cyclical manner, industrial production and construction can develop to an increasingly advanced stage. In other departments and other work, only by being good at seizing opportunities and promptly promoting the transformation of the dual directions of giving equal importance to the side that is conducive to development can the speed of socialist construction become faster and faster.
    In implementing the policy of "walking on two legs," why are there so many doubts and disputes? In the final analysis, it is because some comrades lack a Marxist worldview.
    The Marxist worldview tells us that the universe is a unified and diversified universe. The universe is full of contradictions. Contradictions exist in all processes of the development of things and promote the development of all things. "Walking on two legs" is the concrete application of the law of unity of opposites in socialist construction. Seriously implementing this policy will surely promote the rapid development of various construction undertakings. If we insist on walking on one leg, in essence, we are using a metaphysical worldview to look at problems, isolating and statically "breaking down the whole into parts" and "simplifying the complex" of rich and complex objective things, limiting our thinking to a certain aspect, and becoming accustomed to grasping work with one hand and walking with one leg, which can only lead ourselves into a passive position. In essence, it is a reflection of the bourgeois ideology of not trusting the masses and not relying on the masses.

    学会用“两条腿走路”
    王平夷
    从1958年大跃进以来，杭州市在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，贯彻执行了一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，社会主义建设获得了空前的全面大跃进。几年来的事实，证明了党中央和毛主席提出的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，是国民经济高速度发展的必由之路。
    在贯彻执行重工业和轻工业并举、大中小并举、洋土并举的方针中，也有争论。对重工业和轻工业关系的争论，在大办钢铁的时候表现得最为突出。有些同志叫喊，“以钢为纲，不能带动一切，只是压倒一切”，“元帅好做，小兵难当”；有些同志否定“小土群”的作用，说什么搞小的土的“成本高，浪费大，得不偿失”，“是急功近利”。这些论调，完全是错误的。1958年以来，正由于我们以钢为纲，既抓重工业，又抓轻工业，就出现了全面大跃进。第一个五年计划期间，杭州市重工业每年平均增长速度是38％，轻工业是13％。而1958年与1957年相比，重工业增长二点二倍，轻工业增长了一点一倍。重工业和轻工业的双双跃进，充分证明了重工业和轻工业并举方针的正确。要大不要小、要洋不要土，片面地贪大贪洋、求全求新，只用一条腿走路，是往往走不通的。海潮橡胶厂建厂过程中前后两种不同做法、不同结果，就是明显的例子。这个厂在开始筹建的时候，有些同志认为橡胶厂是“化学工业”，要像个样子，他们期待大厂房、洋设备，还要有个像样的办公室，东奔西走，搞了四个月，一事无成。后来改变了这种做法，没有新机器，修修补补，搞了十台旧机器；没有内胎压缩机，从上海大中华橡胶厂搞来了一台已经报废的机器，苦战七十天，就生产出轮胎。1958年和1959年，正是由于我们采取了穷办法，迅速办起了成千个工厂。这些工厂的产值约占两年来杭州市工业产值增长数的30％左右。可以设想，如果没有这许多工厂投入生产，要高速度发展工业，显然是不可能的。这些活生生的事实，特别是大办钢铁中“小土群”的巨大威力，深刻地教育了我们，千万不能小看“小土群”、“小洋群”的巨大作用。
    在发展工业生产上，对于新建、扩建企业和发挥现有企业潜在力量的问题，也是有争论的。有些同志光想新建、扩建，而不去挖掘企业潜力。他们说：“年年跃进，潜力已经挖得差不多了。”“再不增设备、建新厂，已经无法增产。”固然，新建、扩建企业是扩大再生产的一个重要方面，但是现有企业潜力是不是真的挖光了呢？事实并不是这样。杭州利群烟厂，去年第四季度为了把日产量从两百箱提高到三百五十箱，起初有些人想增加工人，扩建厂房，增添设备，可是一经发动群众大搞技术革新，日产量就提高到三百五十箱，最高的一天达到三百九十箱，人员不仅没有增加，反而减少了一百多人。其他工厂也莫不如此。三年来杭州市工业总产值的大幅度增长，70％是依靠挖掘企业潜力而获得的。从这个数字中完全可以看出，挖掘企业潜力，对于增加生产有多么巨大的作用！如果只用新建、扩建这一条腿，而忽视挖掘潜力这另一条腿，就必然会延缓生产的发展速度。
    所有这些事例表明：两条腿走路，就能多快好省；一条腿走路，必然是少慢差费。在一切部门和一切工作中，都存在着“两条腿走路”的问题，只要我们学会和善于运用两条腿走路，就能够充分调动广大群众的积极性，高速度地发展社会主义建设。但是，“两条腿”在任何情况下，总有一个方面是主要的。例如：发展地方工业，一般地说，应该以中小型企业为主，实行洋土结合为主；发展农业，应该以粮为纲，粮畜并举；发展畜牧业，应该是公养与私养并举，以公养为主，等等。所以并举不等于没有什么主次轻重，正如两条腿走路有先有后一样，我们在贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针的时候，必须具体分析情况，分清前后主次。
    在贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针中，还必须适时地正确地处理大与小、洋与土、普及与提高的关系。有些同志又认为，既然“小土群”有伟大的生命力，那么光普及“小土群”就够了，不必再发展“小洋群”或“中洋群”。他们只满足现状，不想提高，该普及不普及，该提高不提高，这种固定不变的看法是不全面的。事实证明，由土到洋，不断提高，是社会生产发展的必然过程。一切土的必然向洋的方向发展，一切洋的都是在土的基础上成长起来的。所以从发展观点看，满足于“小土群”，不想提高，其结果也不能多快好省，因而也是不对的。现代科学技术日新月异，不但土的、小的需要提高，洋的、大的也要提高，如浙江麻纺织厂的技术设备，就全国范围来讲，刚建立的时候还是先进的，而今天已经不算先进了，现在这个厂正在着手进行技术改造。从这里我们也懂得了：所谓大与小、洋与土、普及与提高，是互相依存、互相联系、互相转化的。土中有洋，洋中有土，普及中有提高，提高中又有普及，不断普及，不断提高，这样循环往复，工业生产建设就能越来越向比较高级的阶段发展。在其他部门、其他工作中，也只有善于掌握时机，及时促进并举的双方向有利于发展的一方转化，才能使社会主义建设的速度越来越快。
    在贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针中，为什么会有这么多的怀疑和争论呢？归根到底，是由于有些同志缺乏马克思主义的宇宙观。
    马克思主义的宇宙观告诉我们，宇宙是一个统一的多样化的宇宙，宇宙间充满着矛盾，矛盾存在于事物发展的一切过程中，推动一切事物的发展。“两条腿走路”，就是矛盾统一规律在社会主义建设中的具体运用。认真地贯彻执行这个方针，就一定会促进各项建设事业迅速发展。如果坚持一条腿走路，实质上就是用形而上学的宇宙观看问题，把丰富的、复杂的客观事物，孤立静止地“化整为零”、“化繁为简”，使自己的思想局限于某一个片面，习惯于用一只手抓工作，用一条腿走路，结果只能使自己陷于被动。实质上就是不相信群众、不依靠群众的资产阶级思想的反映。
