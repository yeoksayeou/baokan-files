Hold High the Great Banner of Mao Zedong Thought
Cui Wei

Actors, like other artists, educate the people with the heroic images they create. At the same time, they, like other artists, are also educated in the process of creating these images. Of course, actors should receive education in other areas as well, constantly improving their political and ideological level. However, they can also find opportunities for learning in the creation of roles.

Actors are not only influenced and inspired by the heroic actions and noble qualities of the heroic figures depicted by playwrights. More importantly, actors, like other artists, regard the creative process as a process of ideological struggle, educating themselves in creative practice, constantly struggling against their own erroneous thoughts, and victoriously completing their tasks along the correct path of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and integrating with them.

Correctly understanding the script and the role one plays is the prerequisite for ensuring the victorious completion of the task. Although understanding is the beginning and the ideal of an actor's creation, it is very important because the actor cannot create without the foundation of his understanding. Whether the image he creates is correct or not is closely related to his understanding.

However, actors, like other artists, cannot correctly understand all of this without establishing a proletarian worldview. They will not possess the ability to distinguish their own mistakes and shortcomings. More importantly, without a proletarian worldview, they will lack the weapon for struggle.

When we were creating the film "The Veteran's New Story," we had many heated debates about the character of Lao Zhan. Some people believed that Lao Zhan was an old cadre who always stood on the front line, possessed a fighting will, and was an excellent Communist Party member, but he had shortcomings. He had a strong feudal consciousness because he opposed dancing. They believed that Duan Shunying's caricature of him was appropriate. Therefore, they disagreed with deleting the scene in the original literary script where Shunying and Lao Zhan's son, Yunsheng, were discovered hiding under a raincoat while in a romantic relationship.

After discussion, we unified our understanding. Everyone recognized that Lao Zhan's prohibition of dancing was by no means driven by feudal ideas, but for the sake of the revolution. At that time, the War of Liberation in Northeast China had not yet been completely won, and the struggle was still in a considerably arduous stage. Lao Zhan understood that in that environment, dancing would affect work and production. Just as he said when he ran to the dormitory to talk to the young people that night: "...I'll tell you the truth, you'll all be shocked. Dancing is temporarily not allowed here, nor is dating, nor is marriage. Our revolutionary family has to live in poverty like this. Think about it, how can we build a nursery for you before the farm is built?..." This completely illustrates that his behavior had no selfish motives or feudal ideas, it was just a bit simplistic!

In the two years of the Great Leap Forward, our socialist literature and art, like other construction undertakings, has achieved brilliant successes. This is the victory of the Party's general line! The victory of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy! However, our achievements are not yet commensurate with this great era. We must further study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly abandon the bourgeois worldview, establish the proletarian worldview, and, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, "go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers unconditionally, wholeheartedly, and for a long time, and go to the heat of struggle" to transform our thinking, and hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art to continue our advance!

    高举毛泽东思想的大旗
    崔嵬
    演员像其他艺术家一样，用自己所创造的英雄形象教育人民，同时，他也像其他艺术家一样，在形象的创造过程中，也使自己受到教育。当然演员应该通过其他方面接受教育，不断提高自己的政治思想水平。但是，在角色的创作中，他也可以得到学习的机会。
    演员不仅是从剧作者所描写的英雄人物的英雄行为、高贵品质中受到影响和鼓舞。更重要的是演员也像其他艺术家一样，把创作过程作为思想斗争过程，在创作实践中来教育自己，不断地同自己的错误思想进行斗争，沿着正确的、为工农兵服务、和工农兵相结合的道路，胜利地完成自己的任务。
    正确地理解剧本、理解自己所扮演的角色，这是保证胜利完成任务的前提。理解虽然是演员创造的开端和理想，但是非常重要，因为演员不可能离开自己的理解的基础进行创造，他所创造的形象正确与否，是同理解有着莫大的关系的。
    但是演员也像其他艺术家一样，如果没有树立起无产阶级的世界观，就无法正确地认识这一切，就不可能具备辨别自己错误和缺点的能力，而更重要的是，没有无产阶级的世界观，也就没有了斗争的武器。
    我们在创作“老兵新传”这部影片时，对于老战这个人物，曾经进行了多次热烈的论争，有些人认为老战是一个永远站在最前线，有战斗意志的老干部，优秀的共产党员，但是他有缺点，他有浓厚的封建意识，因为他反对跳舞。他们认为段舜英用漫画讽刺他，是恰当的。因此他们不同意删去原文学剧本中，舜英和老战的儿子云生在谈恋爱时，躲在一件雨衣中被老战发现的这场戏。
    经过讨论，我们才统一了认识，大家认识到老战禁止跳舞，决不是封建思想的驱使，他是为了革命的利益。那时候，东北的解放战争还没有完全胜利，斗争还处在相当艰苦的阶段，老战他明白，在那种环境中，跳舞将会影响工作和生产。正像当晚他跑到宿舍中和年青人谈心时所说：“……我把真心话告诉你们，你们一定会吓的吐舌头，这儿暂时不光不准跳舞，还不准恋爱，不准结婚，咱们这个革命大家庭的穷日子就得这么过，你们想，怎么能够农场还没盖好，先给你们盖托儿所呢？……”这里完全可以说明，他这种行为，决没有什么私心和封建思想，只不过方式有点简单而已！
    大跃进的两年来，我们社会主义的文学艺术事业，像其他建设事业一样，获得了辉煌的成就，这是党的总路线的胜利！毛主席的文艺方针的胜利！但是我们的成就，同这个伟大的时代还不相称，我们必须进一步地学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席的思想，彻底抛弃资产阶级的世界观，树立起无产阶级的世界观，遵照毛主席的指示：“长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”改造自己的思想，高举着毛泽东文艺思想的大旗继续前进！
