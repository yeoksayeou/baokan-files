    Thirty Li of Coal City, A Sea of Red
    – A Paean to Technical Innovation in the Coal City of Fushun
    By Our Reporters Tan Bingjie and Zhang Xiangbo

    In the annals of the last year of the 1950s, the coal city's athletes, who once wrote a glorious page, have just stepped into the gate of the 1960s and ignited a raging flame of technical innovation and technical revolution in the thirty-li mining area. They are all full of ambition and determined to push the production level to a new peak!

    Red Flowers Bloom in "Milliseconds"
    "Seconds" are considered the smallest unit of time in people's lives. It is the time that passes in the blink of an eye. Who has ever thought further about the significance of "milliseconds" to mankind? A millisecond is only one-thousandth of a second, so short that it is "unseen and unfelt." However, the "millisecond blasting method" being promoted in the Fushun Coal Mine detonates more than a dozen shots in succession within an interval of a few milliseconds to dozens of milliseconds, causing twenty or thirty tons of coal to collapse from the coal wall.

    This high-speed blasting method was successfully tested in the Fushun Tiger Terrace Mine. For many years, Fushun Coal Mine has been using manual methods for blasting, which can only detonate one shot at a time. Each time a shot is fired, the blaster pulls the wire twenty meters away, and after one shot explodes, he returns to connect another wire. When blasting, drilling workers, propping workers, shoveling workers, etc., all have to leave the face and stop working. In this way, about three hours out of eight hours at the face are spent on blasting. They once promoted "multiple shots at once." This method involves several shots exploding at the same time, but because the sound waves are large, it is easy to impact the roof and cause it to sink, and only three to five shots can be fired at a time. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, the workers increasingly understood the meaning of time, and they were determined to master the world's advanced technology – "millisecond blasting method." This method allows many shots to automatically separate at a certain millisecond interval, blasting in sequence, mutually canceling the impact of sound waves on the roof. It is a cutting-edge blasting technology promoted internationally in recent years, which is faster, more economical, and safer compared to previous blasting methods.

    In "millisecond blasting," which borehole explodes first or a few milliseconds later directly affects the amount of coal that collapses and the specifications of the coal wall. The Tiger Terrace Mine cooperated with the Fushun Coal Research Institute to conduct more than eight hundred research experiments on this new technology, overcoming numerous difficulties. They experimented from firing four shots, six shots, nine shots in succession... all the way to firing eighteen shots in succession, and they would not give up until each time they achieved the level of "the coal wall as if shaved off" after the explosion. When eighteen shots were fired within an interval of seventy-five milliseconds, the technicians brought a pressure gauge and placed one end of the prop against the newly blasted coal roof and the other end on the pressure gauge to test the roof pressure changes as if weighing it on a scale. At the same time, they used an automatic roof subsidence recorder to observe the degree of roof subsidence. The test results showed that everything was normal.

    "Millisecond blasting," this world's new technology, was finally mastered by the intelligent coal city miners! It shortened the blasting time per shift from three hours to more than one hour. "Milliseconds," this tiny unit of time that people usually don't pay attention to, blooms with brilliant flowers in the coal city.

    Breaking Through the "Bottleneck"
    The coal city's athletes, in the battle to seize high speed, are never satisfied with the technical innovation of one process or production topping; they always advance victoriously, organizing a series of processes to catch up and achieve active balance. In the past two or three months, the entire mine has successively seen thousands of advanced technologies that adapt and connect to each other.

    The Victory Mine is a good example of continuous revolution. At the end of last year, they promoted advanced technologies such as "millisecond blasting," and the raw coal poured down like a waterfall at the face, and the production capacity increased sharply. However, the process below it – shoveling coal – was far behind due to heavy physical labor. The coal reached the transport chute, just like water reaching the bottleneck of a bottle, and suddenly became a "trickle." It took forty minutes to transport sixty cars of coal. Some time ago, Wu Xiang, a shoveling coal pacesetter in the first district, saw that piles of coal could not be transported to the surface in time, and the coal miners were standing by waiting. He waved his strong arms and shouted to his companions, "Our shoveling coal workers will never be stumbling blocks to the Great Leap Forward, and we must run foot-to-foot with the coal miners!" "Right!" Everyone jumped up in response, each grabbing a shovel as big as a dustpan, and using the rapid shoveling method, they shoveled sixty cars of coal to the chute in one go, taking only twenty-three minutes. This unprecedented record is already quite remarkable. But Wu Xiang looked back and saw that he was still not keeping up with the coal miners. He wiped his sweat, stuck his shovel hard into the ground, and a strong thought arose in his mind – he had to replace this thing!

    Wu Xiang's wish was realized so quickly! On December 29th of last year, the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a heroic call to the miners: to advance towards the mechanization of shoveling coal and put down the shovels within ten days! At this time, Wu Xiang was even more energetic. He and his companions obtained the help of technicians and electromechanical workers, and everyone used their hands and brains together, referring to the experience of Fuxin, and in less than a day, they improved the shoveling machine that was difficult to use in the past into a very easy-to-use shoveling machine. The birth of the new machine caused jubilation throughout the mine. All departments cooperated, and in just half a day, they prepared complete drawings, materials, and tools for mass production... and sent them to the electromechanical plant. The electromechanical workers worked hard day and night, and an hour before New Year's Day, they produced the first batch of shoveling machines and sent them underground. In the first shift starting at zero o'clock on New Year's Day, Wu Xiang and his companions threw away their shovels, started the shoveling machine, and skillfully shuttled through the piles of coal, able to throw one hundred and fifty pounds of coal into the chute at once. The chute was no longer like a bottleneck, and the coal above was always pointed, rolling out. Efficiency increased by 2.4 times. Wu Xiang and the others finally leaped forward foot-to-foot with the coal miners!

    Like Wu Xiang, the entire Victory Mine won the first battle of this year's technical revolution. In just a few days, it basically realized the mechanization of shoveling coal. Shoveling coal is no longer the most laborious work here, and more than half of the labor force in this process will be saved. Shoveling coal is no longer a hindrance to the mine's rapid progress. Shoveling coal workers also picked up advanced tools and, along with coal miners, competed side by side in production, advancing at high speed!

    In the Blink of an Eye, Fragrant Flowers Bloom Everywhere
    One flower does not make a spring; good technology limited to a few people cannot create large-scale high yields. The miners of Fushun deeply understand this truth. Recently, they summarized more than one hundred major technologies in performance competitions and adopted various methods such as "seeking scriptures" and "sending treasures" to quickly promote them to all aspects. Many technical innovations with remarkable results often bloom in one place and, in a short time, are transplanted everywhere and bloom in competition.

    Some time ago, in the upsurge of creating high yields in the Longfeng Mine, the "arrows" on the production charts of the first coal mining district always rose in a straight line. When the workers in the fourth coal mining district saw that their "arrows" were more than half lower, they could not hold their breath and wanted to quickly go to the first district to learn. Coincidentally, the new technology dissemination team composed of mine leaders, technicians, and veteran workers summarized ten major experiences in the first district and sent them to the door of the fourth district. The workers in the fourth district were extremely happy. The workers in the advanced collectives attending the National Congress of Heroes – the 421 face and the 432 face – first beat thunderous gongs and drums, inviting the dissemination team to their own underground to demonstrate the advanced experiences of the first district.

    The veteran workers in the dissemination team are all famous experts in various mining areas and types of work in the entire mine. As soon as they arrived underground, they picked up their tools and worked with the workers on the two faces to mine coal using new technologies. They taught "little teachers" in actual operation, and then the "little teachers" spread the knowledge to the workers in each shift. Zhao Junyan, a drilling worker in the dissemination team, heard that the 432 face implemented "four-shift cross-operation" to increase production, but there were still problems. During the crossover time of the two shifts, the drilling, blasting, and transportation processes were not tightly connected, and the two shifts of workers were unevenly busy. He and Huang Weishan, the team leader on this face, observed for a while and saw that the problem was that the drilling was too slow. He immediately decided to promote the "double electric drill parallel operation method." He and Huang Weishan each led a person and placed an electric drill at each end of the forty-meter-long face, making a whirring sound at the same time. In this way, the two shifts of workers in cross-operation each did their own work without affecting each other. The drilling efficiency was doubled, the blasting was also timely, and the amount of coal mined in this shift jumped from 180 cars to 250 cars at once. Encouraged by this new record, the workers on the 421 face smoothly promoted "long-distance deep-hole drilling." They replaced the short drill rods, held the two-and-a-half-meter-long drill rods, aimed them at the face, turned on the motor, and in an instant, the drill bit flew, and the coal powder formed into clusters. The speed increased by 200 revolutions per minute compared to the past, and the time was not extended at all. The depth of the blasting holes was increased from 1.3 meters to 1.7 meters. The distance between each hole was also several hundred centimeters farther than in the past. The same size face required 25% fewer holes to be drilled. The time was shortened by one hour, but the amount of coal blasted increased sharply by nearly 30%.

    Many experiences from the first district yielded fruitful results on the two faces in the fourth district on the same day, attracting the workers of the entire mine and making their hearts bloom. A craze of everyone learning and everyone using quickly formed, and a coordinated situation emerged in the two-shift crossover operation, where blasting did not wait for drilling, transportation did not wait for blasting..., ensuring balanced high production day after day and ten days after ten days.

    New Vanguard Advancing Knowing the Difficulty
    In the hot technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the new miners who had not been in the mines for long, like Jun horses running on the racecourse for the first time, enthusiastically plunged into the tide of "quick learning, quick practice, quick improvement," and rapidly improved their operational skills. Guo Yuchun, of the first shift of the second district of the Tiger Terrace Mine, is a new vanguard running at the head of the tide.

    A year ago, Guo Yuchun was still a middle school student with a strong childishness, but now he is already a skilled propping worker. He can independently handle roof conditions with broken wires, roof collapses, etc. The shed that usually takes twenty minutes to build, he can complete in fifteen or sixteen minutes. His shift leader told us admiringly that in the past, new workers who had just come to the mine needed about three years to reach his level of skill. Guo Yuchun, this energetic young man, since coming to the mine, has humbly studied hard and been brave in the face of difficulties, making up for three years in one year.

    When he first went underground, he saw the master craftsmen chop out a roof beam in three or two strokes, and he felt that this job was very easy and that there was not much skill involved. But when he picked up an axe to try it himself, the axe would not listen to him. It was crooked and refused to go to the place that his eyes were measuring. From this, Guo Yuchun realized that there are skills everywhere in production labor, and only by adopting a hard-working and serious labor attitude can one gain pure skills. He took the initiative to learn from the master craftsmen. He kept in mind and noted in his heart every move and every word of the master craftsmen during labor. His master, Yan Baoyi, often said to him, "Four inches of wood, eight wedges," which meant to tell him that as long as he could accurately chop out eight wedges on wood four inches thick, he would have mastered the axe. Guo Yuchun firmly followed his master's words and practiced hard. Whenever it was time to blast, the large face had to stop working, so he took advantage of this gap to take a piece of wood and sit at the mouth of the chute and carefully chop wedges. After several hard practices, the axe obediently listened to him. Now he is so skilled that he can chop off a "kissing mouth" roof beam in three strokes, and he will never chop it in four strokes.

    However, for propping workers, the most difficult thing is not wielding the axe; turning a dangerous roof into a safe one at the fastest possible operating speed is the time to test the true skills of the propping workers. The master craftsmen generally do not want to teach new workers how to do this kind of difficult work. Guo Yuchun, knowing the difficulties, volunteered to do it. After he first handled a seven- or eight-meter-long roof collapse under the guidance of the master craftsman, he found that he was not calm and his eyesight was not accurate in the tense operation. He found that the main reason was that he was not familiar with the safety of the roof, so he focused on learning from his master how to observe the safety of the roof. In order to exercise his eyesight, even if he had time to measure the dimensions when building a shed on weekdays, he always estimated it first and then pulled out the tape measure to verify the accuracy.

    Guo Yuchun improved his operating level rapidly with the spirit of advancing knowing the difficulty, allowing himself to emit more light and heat in the Great Leap Forward of the coal city. (Attached picture)

    三十里煤都一片红
    ——煤都抚顺大搞技术革新的赞歌
    本报记者　谭冰洁　张向波
    在二十世纪五十年代最后一年的史册上，曾经写下光辉一页的煤都健儿，刚刚跨进六十年代的门槛，就在三十里矿区，燃起了技术革新和技术革命的熊熊火焰。他们都满怀壮志，决心把生产水平推向新的高峰！
    红花开在“毫秒”间
    “秒”，在人们的生活中算是最微小的计时单位了。它是眨一下眼皮就逝去了的时间。谁曾进一步想过“毫秒”对人类的意义呢？一毫秒只是一秒钟的千分之一，它短促得“神不知，鬼不觉”。然而，抚顺煤矿正在推广的“毫秒爆破法”，却在几毫秒到几十毫秒的间隔时间里，连续放完十几个炮，使二、三十吨煤炭从煤壁上崩落下来。
    这一高速度的爆破方法是在抚顺老虎台矿试验成功的。抚顺煤矿多少年来一直是用手工方式进行爆破，一次只能放一个炮。每次在放炮的时候，放炮员把电线拉出二十米远，一个炮响过以后，再回去接另一个炮线。放炮时，打眼工、支柱工、攉锹工等，都得离开掌子面，停止作业。这样，在掌子面上，八个钟头之中约有三个钟头都用在放炮上。他们曾经推行过“一次多放炮”。这种方法是几个炮在同一时间里爆破，由于声浪大，容易冲击顶板下沉，一次也只能放三个到五个炮。在大跃进的年代里，职工们越来越懂得时间的意义，他们立下雄心要掌握世界先进技术——“毫秒爆破法”。这种方法可以让很多个炮自动分出一定毫秒的间隔时间，顺序地爆破，互相抵消声浪对顶板的冲击力。它是近几年来国际上推行的一项尖端爆破技术，同以往的爆破方法比较，真是又快又省又安全。
    “毫秒爆破”中，哪一个炮眼先响或后响几毫秒，都会直接影响崩落煤炭的数量和煤壁的规格。老虎台矿同抚顺煤炭科学研究院合作，对这项新技术反复进行了八百多次研究试验，闯过了重重难关。他们从连续放四个炮、六个炮、九个炮……一直试验到连续放十八个炮，每回都是达到“炮声一响，煤壁如削”的程度才肯罢休。当在七十五毫秒的间隔时间内放了十八个炮的时候，技术人员搬来压力计，把支柱的一头顶到刚刚爆破过的煤顶板上，另一头支在压力计上，像用磅秤过重一样地检验顶板压力变化情况，同时用顶板下沉自动记录仪来观测顶板下沉程度。检验结果，一切都很正常。
    “毫秒爆破”，这项世界新技术，终于被智慧的煤都矿工掌握起来了！它使每班的放炮时间从三小时缩短到一个多小时。“毫秒”，这个人们平时注意不到的时间微数，在煤都开放出灿烂的花朵。
    突破“瓶子口”
    煤都的健儿，在巧夺高速度的战斗中，从来不满足一个工序的技术革新，生产拔尖；他们总是乘胜挺进，组织一系列工序迎头赶上，实现积极均衡。最近两三个月来，全矿已经先后出现了上千种互相适应、互相衔接的先进技术。
    胜利矿就是一个不断革命的好典型。去年末，他们推行了“毫秒爆破”等先进技术，掌子上的原煤瀑布似的落下来，生产能力猛增一倍。可是，它下边的工序——攉煤，由于是笨重的体力劳动，远远落在后面。煤到了运输溜子上，就如水到了瓶子口，突然变成了“涓涓细流”。六十车煤非花四十分钟运不出去。前些日子，一区攉煤标兵吴祥，看到成堆的煤不能及时运到井上，采煤工站在一旁干等着，他挥了挥粗壮的胳膊，向同伴们大呼道：“咱攉煤工决不当跃进的绊脚石，一定要和采煤工脚跟脚的跑！”“对！”大家随声跃了起来，各人操起一把簸箕大的铁锹，用快速攉煤法，一口气把六十车煤攉到了溜子上，只花了二十三分钟。这个空前纪录，已经很可观了。可是吴祥回头看了看，还是跟不上采煤工。他擦了擦汗水，把手中的铁锹猛地插在地上，心里泛起一个强烈的念头——非换掉这家伙不可！
    吴祥的愿望竟这样快地实现了！去年12月29日，中共抚顺市委向矿工们提出了豪壮的号召：向攉煤机械化进军，十天内放下铁锹！这时，吴祥更浑身长了劲，他和同伴们取得了技术人员和机电工人的帮助，大伙手脑并用，参考阜新的经验，不到一天，就把过去不好使唤的攉煤机，改进为很好用的攉煤机。新机器的诞生，引起全矿欢腾。各部门大协作，只用半天时间，就齐齐全全准备了开始成批制造用的图纸、材料和工具……送到机电厂里。机电工人们苦干了一昼夜，到元旦前一小时，造出了第一批攉煤机，送到了井下。吴祥在新年零点开始的第一班，便和同伴们扔掉铁锹，开动攉煤机，灵巧地在煤堆上穿来穿去，一下子能把一百五十斤煤丢到溜子上。溜子再也不像个瓶子口了，上边的煤老是挂着尖，滚滚地向外流去，效率提高了二点四倍。吴祥他们终于和采煤工们脚跟脚地跃进了！
    全胜利矿，和吴祥一样，打胜了今年技术革命的前哨战，短短几天中，基本上实现了攉煤机械化。攉煤，在这里再不是最劳累的工作，这个工序一半以上的劳动力，将要节省下来；攉煤，再也不是全矿大踏步前进的羁绊，攉煤工也拿起先进工具，和采煤工在生产上比翼齐飞，高速迈进！
    一转眼香花遍地
    鲜花一朵不是春；好技术只限在少数人手中，创造不出大面积高产。抚顺的矿工们，深深懂得这个道理。最近他们在表演赛中，总结出了一百多项重大技术，采取“取经”“送宝”等多种方式，迅速推行到各个方面。许多成效卓著的技术革新的花朵，往往刚在一地开花，未经几时，就遍地移植，处处竞放。
    前些日子，在龙凤矿创高产的热潮中，第一采煤区生产图表上的“箭头”，总是直线上升；第四采煤区的工人们一看，比自己的“箭头”高出了大半截，心里就沉不住气了，想赶快到一区去学学。恰巧，矿里领导人员、技术人员和老工人组成的新技术传播队，在一区总结了十大经验，送到四区门上来。四区工人们高兴极啦，出席全国群英会的先进集体——四二一掌子和四三二掌子上的工人，首先敲起震天的锣鼓，邀请传播队到自己井下，表演一区的先进经验。
    传播队的老工人，都是全矿各采区、各工种的著名能手。他们一到井下，就操起工具，和两个掌子上的工人，一起用新技术采煤。在实地操作中教出“小先生”，再由“小先生”传播给各班工人。传播队的打眼工赵俊言，听说四三二掌子实行“四班交叉作业”提高了产量，但还有问题，两个班交叉作业的时间内，打眼、放炮、运输等工序衔接不紧，两班工人忙闲不均。他便和这个掌子上的组长黄维山一同观察了一番，看出问题在于打眼太慢，当即决定推行“双电钻平行作业法”。他俩各带一个人，在四十米长的掌子上，一头放一台电钻，同时发出??的响声。这样，交叉作业的两个班之间，各干各的活，互不影响，打眼效率快了一倍，放炮也及时了，这一班的采煤量，一下子就由一百八十车跳到了二百五十车。在这个新纪录的鼓舞下，四二一掌子上的工人又顺利地推广了“远距离深孔打眼”。他们换掉短钎子，拿着两米半长的长钎子对准掌子，打开电动机，刹时钻头如飞，煤粉团团，每分钟比过去加快了二百转，时间一点不延长，爆破眼的深度便由过去的一点三米加深到一点七米；各个眼的距离，也比过去远了几百厘米，同样大的掌子面上，少打了25％的眼；时间缩短了一小时，炸下的煤却猛增了将近30％。
    一区的多项经验，当天就在四区两个掌子上结出丰硕的果实，吸引得全矿工人心花怒放，很快形成了人人学、个个用的热潮，出现了两班交叉作业中，放炮不等打眼、运输不等放炮……的协调局面，保证了日日旬旬均衡高产。
    知难而进的新尖兵
    在火热的技术革新技术革命运动中，踏进矿山不久的新矿工们，像初奔赛场的骏马，奋发雄劲地卷进了“快学、快练、快提高”的浪潮，飞快地提高着自己的操作本领。老虎台矿二区一班的郭雨春，是跑在浪头上的一名新尖兵。
    一年前，郭雨春还是一个稚气很浓的初中学生，现在已经是技术娴熟的支柱工人了。他能独立处理断线、冒顶等条件很坏的顶板，一般地需要在二十几分钟搭好的棚子，他用十五、六分钟就能完成。他的班长夸赞地告诉我们，以往乍来矿上的新工人，要达到他这样的技术水平，需要三年左右。郭雨春，这个干劲充足的小伙子，自到矿山以来，虚心苦学，知难勇为，一年赶过了三年。
    刚到井下时，他看着老师傅三下两下就砍出一个棚梁子，觉得这个营生很轻易，怕是没有多大技术。可是自己拿起斧头一试，那斧子怎么也不听使唤，它东歪西斜，不肯往自己眼睛照量的那个地方去。由此，郭雨春体会到生产劳动中处处有巧技，只有拿出刻苦严肃的劳动态度，才能换得纯熟的技术。他主动向老师傅学习，老师傅在劳动中的一举一动，对他的一言一示，他都看在眼里，记在心上。师傅阎宝义常对他说“四寸木头，八个楔子，”这意思是告诉他，只要能在四寸粗的木头上准准确确地砍出八个楔子，斧头就练出来了。郭雨春坚定地遵循着师傅的话去苦练，每到放炮的时候，大掌子里要停止作业，他就趁这空隙，拿块木头坐在溜子口用心地砍楔子。几经苦练，斧头乖乖地听话了。现在他已熟练到这种程度：叫它三下砍下“亲口”棚梁子，绝不会砍上四下。
    但是，对支柱工来说，最困难的还不是使唤斧头；以尽快的操作速度变危险的顶板为安全，是考验支柱工的真本领的时候。像这种困难的活儿，老师傅一般地是不肯教给新工人做的。郭雨春知难勇为，主动要求干。他在老师傅的指导下，第一次处理了七、八米长的冒顶以后，发现自己在紧张的操作中，不沉着，眼力不准。他找出的原因，主要是对顶板的安全情况不熟悉，于是他就专意向师傅学习观察顶板安全情况。为了锻炼眼力，平日搭棚子时，即使有时间去量尺寸，他也总要先估量一下，然后再拉开卷尺验证准确程度。
    郭雨春就这样以知难勇为的精神，飞快地提高了自己的操作水平，让自己在煤都的跃进中，发出更多的光和热。（附图片）
