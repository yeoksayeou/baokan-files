Leaping Towards New Heights
Liu Xiuyin, National Agricultural Labor Model, Director of Taiqian Commune, Shouzhang County, Shandong

    1959 has passed, and 1960 has arrived. 1959 was a year of even greater leaps forward for the people of Taiqian People's Commune. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we held high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, giving full play to the superiority of the People's Commune, which is characterized by its large size and high degree of public ownership. We overcame the great drought of one hundred days without rain and achieved a bumper harvest on top of the Great Leap Forward of 1958. The average yield of grain crops across the commune's 100,000 mu of land reached 1,066 jin per mu, an increase of 66% compared to the bountiful year of 1958. Although we have achieved an all-round leap forward in industrial and agricultural (including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery) production and construction, we are not complacent about our achievements. We want to scale new heights in 1960, striving to be pioneers in the leap forward. After in-depth education on the General Line, all cadres and commune members have further raised their awareness and set lofty ambitions, determined to leap towards new heights.

    The production targets set by our commune for 1960 are: a per-mu yield of grain of double 1,000 jin, and an average income of 250 yuan per commune member. Everyone unanimously believes that there are many favorable conditions for achieving the above targets: the wise leadership of the Party and the shining light of the General Line; the People's Commune, after rectification and consolidation, can better give full play to its "large size and high degree of public ownership" advantages; in 1960, agricultural mechanization can be basically achieved, greatly increasing labor productivity; diversified operations are developing greatly, providing more strength to support agricultural production. In particular, after the in-depth education on the General Line, the consciousness of cadres and the masses has been greatly improved, and the direction is clearer. As long as we make full use of these favorable conditions and overcome unfavorable factors, it is possible to achieve the 1960 production increase plan.

    In order to achieve the above targets, our specific measures are: to prominently grasp the realization of large-scale high-standard garden-style farmland, the leveling of land into terraced fields, the popularization of improved varieties, the standardization of close planting, and the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture. We have put forward five guarantees: (1) Guarantee to apply more fertilizer and apply it rationally, applying 30,000 jin of coarse fertilizer, 1,000 jin of fine fertilizer, and 70 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu. To ensure the realization of the fertilization plan, we must vigorously develop pig farming, reaching one pig per mu of land in 1960; (2) Guarantee to do a good job in field management, dividing the land into sections and assigning responsibilities, implementing the "three guarantees," "six fixings," and "four responsibilities to the field" management system; (3) Guarantee to continuously innovate technology, reform tools, and improve labor productivity; (4) Guarantee to do a good job in preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and strive to achieve an insect-free commune; (5) Guarantee to achieve careful harvesting and threshing, ensuring that every grain returns home.

    To achieve the above production increase targets, we must also tightly grasp political leadership, vigorously carry out mass movements, grasp politics with one hand and production with the other, launch red flag competitions, and create a movement to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward.

    跃向新的高峰
    全国农业劳动模范山东寿张县台前公社社长  刘秀印
    1959年过去了，1960年已经到来。1959年，是台前人民公社更大跃进的一年。我们在党中央和毛主席的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，发挥了人民公社一大二公的优越性，战胜了百日无雨的大旱，在1958年大跃进的基础上，又获得了大丰收。全社十万亩粮食作物平均单产一千零六十六斤，较大丰收的1958年增长了66％。我们虽然取得了工农业（包括林、牧、副、渔）各项生产建设全面跃进，但是我们并不为所取得的成就骄傲自满。我们要在1960年更上一层楼，跃进当中再争先。全体干部、社员，经过深入开展总路线的教育，已进一步提高了觉悟，立下雄心壮志，决心跃向新的高峰。
    我们社制订的1960年的生产指标是：粮食亩产双千斤，社员平均每人收入达到二百五十元。大家一致认为，实现上述指标的有利条件很多：有党的英明领导，总路线的光辉照耀；人民公社经过了整顿巩固，更能充分发挥“一大二公”的优越性；1960年可以基本上实现耕作机械化，大大提高劳动生产率；多种经营大发展，更有力量支援农业生产。尤其是经过深入开展总路线的教育之后，干部和群众觉悟大大提高，方向更加明确了，只要充分运用这些有利条件，克服不利因素，实现1960年增产规划是可能的。
    为了实现上述指标，我们的具体措施是：突出地抓住实现大地高标准园田化、土地平整畦田化、良种普及化、密植规格化和全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”。我们提出了五个保证：（1）保证多施肥，合理施肥，每亩施粗肥三万斤，细肥一千斤，化肥七十斤。为保证施肥计划实现，要大力发展养猪，1960年达到一亩地一头猪；（2）保证做好田间管理，土地划片分方，实行“三包”、“六定”、“四到田”的管理责任制；（3）保证不断革新技术，改革工具，提高劳动生产率；（4）保证做好防治病虫害，力争实现无虫社；（5）保证做到精收细打，颗粒还家。
    为实现上述增产指标，我们还要紧紧抓住政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，一手抓政治，一手抓生产，开展红旗竞赛，掀起学先进、赶先进、帮落后的运动。
