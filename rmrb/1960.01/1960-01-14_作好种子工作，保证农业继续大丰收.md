Do a Good Job in Seed Work to Ensure Continued Bumper Harvest in Agriculture

Today, this newspaper's first page reports that Hengyang Prefecture in Hunan Province, in order to strive for a continued bumper harvest in agriculture this year, issued ten proposals to the entire province of Hunan regarding the improvement of seed work, proposing measures such as comprehensively innovating low-yield varieties, strengthening seed storage work, and establishing and improving a good seed testing, demonstration, and breeding network. This matter deserves attention from all localities.

"A strong mother produces fat children," is an experienced summary of agricultural production. The successful cultivation and promotion of a new variety is a major event in promoting agricultural production. Last year, Chaoyang County in Guangdong Province, after trying the "Dwarf Nante" improved variety on 15,000 mu of rice fields, coupled with other yield-increasing measures, achieved an average yield of 657 jin per mu, which was about 200 jin more per mu than ordinary varieties. After the Xiangfen People's Commune in the Damiao Mountain Miao Autonomous County of Guangxi selected improved rice varieties, the yield increased by more than 200 jin per mu. From this, it can be seen that cultivating and promoting good varieties is an important task to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

From the perspective of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture as a whole, soil is the root, fertilizer is the strength, water is life, and seeds are the foundation. These four are the most fundamental conditions for the life and reproduction of all crops. Grasping soil, fertilizer, and water can improve the living conditions of crops; grasping seed work can exert the good genetic characteristics of the crops themselves. The improvement of crop living conditions and the excellence of the crop's own characteristics are two indispensable aspects of crop yield growth. Superior varieties themselves are the product of various agricultural yield-increasing measures; the promotion of superior varieties enables other measures to play a better role. Under the circumstances that soil, fertilizer, water, and other conditions have been greatly improved and continue to improve, in order to ensure that the labor already paid blossoms with greater leap forward and bears greater harvest fruits, we must strive to cultivate good varieties, promote good varieties, and replace them with better varieties.

Is it possible to do a better job in seed work this year? It is entirely possible. Over the past ten years, seed work has laid a very good foundation. In terms of the number of improved varieties promoted and selected: there were only more than 200 before liberation; there are more than 2,400 after liberation; more than 1,000 new varieties have been selected in the past ten years (including those selected by agricultural scientific research institutions and farmers), of which 74 were selected before 1952, 481 were selected during the First Five-Year Plan period, and 459 were selected during the two years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959. In terms of the establishment of good seed breeding bases: at present, in addition to the state-established good seed breeding farms, most of the people's communes have established seed selection areas to carry out experiments and good seed breeding work, and each production team has also generally established seed plots or seed fields. At present, the area of good seed promotion in the country has reached more than 1.8 billion mu, accounting for more than 80% of the country's sown area.

What is particularly important is that in our work of cultivating good varieties in recent years, we have cultivated a group of seed experts from peasant backgrounds. Yang Minghan from Guangdong Province, who successfully cultivated "Thousand Grain Spike," Yang Kuangbao from Zhejiang Province, who successfully cultivated "Ten Thousand Grain Jin," Zhang Sizhou and Ren Changgui from Sichuan and Hebei Provinces, who successfully cultivated large cotton bolls, and Zhang Bao from Heilongjiang Province, who successfully grafted castor beans and soybeans, are all outstanding figures who have worked hard with the masses to carry out good seed breeding work. Among the new generation of rural youth, many have made grand aspirations to change the backwardness of agricultural production, and many of them want to be Chinese "Michurins," determined to cultivate many, many good varieties for the country. In order to cultivate a good variety, these people are reading various relevant scientific works with great difficulty, but also very tenaciously. It is precisely because they have established such lofty ambitions and dare to doubt the conclusions in the works of bourgeois scientists and dare to carry out various experiments that they have made relatively large contributions in seed work.

With so many good varieties, such good experience in cultivating and promoting good varieties, and such valuable seed experts, this is the guarantee that we can do a better job in seed work this year. Of course, like doing other work well, seed work must also adhere to putting politics in command and launching a mass movement on a large scale. Guangdong Province has achieved relatively large achievements in breeding and promoting good varieties because it has widely mobilized the masses and formed a good seed breeding and promotion network. According to a survey of 23 counties in the province, there are 7,349 professional youth seed teams, with 68,450 young people participating. In addition to these professional teams, 74% of the youth in the province participated in rice seed selection. Since the second half of 1958, Liuzhou Prefecture in Guangxi Province has used 20 good varieties of japonica rice and glutinous rice to conduct comparative tests with local indica rice varieties. It was found that under the same soil, fertilizer, water, and tillage conditions, the yield of 19 japonica rice and glutinous rice varieties was higher than that of local indica rice varieties, with an increase ranging from 19% to 89%. Based on this situation, they established agricultural scientific experiment stations and good seed breeding farms at the prefecture level, good seed farms were established in each county, and experiment farms were established in each people's commune, forming a "seed system," which closely combined seed scientific research with mass seed selection and breeding. They used a large number of vivid facts to promote the promotion of good varieties.

To launch a mass movement in seed work does not mean that we can neglect professional scientific research work in breeding. In order to accelerate the development of seed work, we must firmly grasp the strength of scientific research institutions and closely combine them with the mass seed selection and breeding movement and the mass production practice; at the same time, we must strengthen and improve the already established seed professional organizations in the people's communes, so that they are combined with the seasonal large-scale mass seed selection movement, so as to better realize the seed work policy of self-breeding and self-selection, self-retention and self-use, supplemented by necessary regulation. In this way, the masses can be continuously mobilized to do a good job in seed selection, breeding, testing, creation, domestication, introduction, inspection, storage, and other activities in the spring sowing, summer harvest and planting, autumn harvest and planting, and winter storage seasons; at the same time, these achievements can be further developed and improved through the activities of professional scientific research institutions.

The current urgent task of seed work is to meet the requirements of the continued leap forward in agricultural production, make full use of extremely favorable conditions, and prepare for this year's spring plowing and sowing. A mass seed general survey should be carried out. Cadres at all levels of the people's communes and commune members should work together to check the seeds selected and left over from the autumn harvest crops in accordance with the 1960 production plan to see if the quantity is sufficient? Is the quality good? Is the variety correct? The actual number and the required number should be carefully checked to see if they are sufficient. If it is found that it is not enough, exchange it quickly. The new varieties that must be promoted and replaced this year according to the plan, as well as the good varieties that are not available locally but are needed for expanding replanting and reforming the cultivation system, must also be seized to regulate from other places. The leading organs should pay special attention to providing assistance to the seeds that need to be supplemented in the disaster areas to ensure that there is a sufficient quantity. The seeds retained by the people's communes and the seeds stored by the state must be properly kept, achieving four withouts (no insects, no mold, no rodents, no accidents) and two guarantees (guarantee purity, guarantee germination rate). For seeds that must be stored separately, we must make full use of the experience of the masses in storing small amounts of seeds for many years to ensure safe storage.

If the work of soil, fertilizer, and water is done well, and the seed work is done well, we will definitely be able to lay a victorious foundation for a large increase in agricultural production this year; we will definitely be able to set off a great leap forward in seed work to ensure a great leap forward in agricultural production.

    作好种子工作，保证农业继续大丰收
    今天本报一版报道了湖南衡阳专区为争取今年农业继续大丰收，向湖南全省发出了关于改进种子工作的十大倡议，提出全面革新低产品种、加强种子保管工作、建立和健全良种试验示范繁殖网等项措施。这件事情值得各地注意。
      “母壮儿肥”，是农业生产的一项经验总结。一个新品种的培育成功和推广，是推动农业增产的一件大事。去年广东潮阳县在一万五千亩稻田试用“矮脚南特”良种以后，加上其他增产措施，平均亩产达到六百五十七斤，比普通品种每亩多收二百斤左右。广西大苗山苗族自治县香粉人民公社水稻选用良种以后，每亩增加产量二百多斤。由此可见，好好的培育良种和推广良种，是保证今年农业大丰收的一项重要工作。
    从八字宪法整体来看，土是根，肥是劲，水是命，种是本。这四项是一切农作物生活和繁殖的最根本的条件。抓土、肥、水，可以改善作物的生活条件；抓种子工作，可以发挥作物本身的好的遗传特性。作物生活条件的改善和作物本身特性的优良，是作物产量增长的不可缺少的两个方面。优良品种本身，是其它各项农业增产措施的产物；推广了优良品种，其它各项措施就能更好地发挥作用。在土、肥、水等等条件已经大大改善和继续不断改善的情况下，为了确保已经付出的劳动开出更大跃进之花，结出更大丰收之果，必须努力培育良种、推广良种和更换更好的良种。
    今年能不能把种子工作做得更好呢？完全可能。十年来，种子工作已经奠定了很好的基础。就推广和选育优良品种的数目来看：解放前只有二百多个；解放后共有二千四百多个；十年来共选育出新品种一千多个（包括农业科学研究机关和农民选育的），其中1952年以前选出的七十四个，第一个五年计划期间选出的四百八十一个，1958年和1959年大跃进的两年，选出了四百五十九个。就良种繁殖基地的设置来看：目前，除了国家设立的良种繁育场以外，绝大部分的人民公社已经建立了种子的选育区域，进行试验和良种繁殖工作，各个生产队还普遍建立了种子地或者种子田。现在，全国良种推广的面积已达十八亿多亩，占全国播种面积的80％以上。
    特别重要的，是我们几年来在培育良种工作中，培养了一批农民出身的种子专家。广东省培育“千粒穗”成功的杨明汉、浙江省培育“万粒斤”成功的杨匡保、四川和河北省培育大棉桃成功的张泗洲和任长贵、黑龙江省把蓖麻和大豆嫁接成功的张宝等等同志，都是和群众一起努力进行良种培育工作的出色人物。在新的一代农村青年中，许多人立下了改变农业生产的落后面貌的宏伟志愿，其中有不少人要做中国的“米丘林”，决心为国家培育出许许多多良种来。为了培育一种良种，这些人非常艰难地，但又是非常顽强地读着各种有关的科学著作。正因为他们树立了这样的雄心大志，敢于怀疑资产阶级科学家著作中的定论，敢于进行各种各样的试验，因而在种子工作方面也就作出了比较大的贡献。
    有了这样多的良种，有了这样好的培育和推广良种的经验，又有了这样可贵的种子专家，这就是我们今年能够把种子工作作得更好的保证。当然，同做好其他工作一样，种子工作也要坚持政治挂帅和大搞群众运动。广东省在繁育、推广良种方面取得了比较大的成绩，就因为广泛地发动了群众，形成了一个良种繁育和推广网。根据该省二十三个县的调查，专业的青年种子队有七千三百四十九队，参加的青年有六万八千四百五十人。除了这些专业队外，全省74％的青年参加了水稻的选种工作。广西柳州专区从1958年下半年以来，用二十个粳稻、糯稻良种同当地籼稻良种作对比试验，发现在同样的土、肥、水和同样的耕作情况下，十九个粳稻糯稻品种的产量都比当地籼稻良种的产量高，增产幅度从19％到89％。根据这种情况，他们在专区一级设立了农业科学试验站和良种繁殖场，各个县设立良种场，各人民公社都建立试验场，形成了一个“种子系统”，种子科学研究工作同群众选种育种紧密结合起来。他们用大量的活生生的事实推动了良种推广工作。
    在种子工作方面大搞群众运动，并不是说可以忽视育种方面专业的科学研究工作。为了使种子工作加速发展，必须紧紧抓住科学研究机关的力量，使它们同群众的选种育种运动和群众的生产实践密切结合起来；同时，还要在人民公社里加强和提高已经建立起来的种子专业组织，使它们同季节性的大规模的群众选种运动结合起来，更好地实现自繁自选、自留自用、辅之以必要调剂的种子工作方针。这样，就可以在春播、夏收夏种、秋收秋种、冬藏各个季节，连续地发动群众做好种子的选择、培育、试验、创造、驯化、引进、检验、保管等等活动；同时，又可以把这些方面的成就，通过专业科学研究机关的活动，进一步发扬和提高。
    当前种子工作的紧迫的任务是：适应农业生产继续跃进的要求，充分利用极为有利的条件，为今年的春耕播种做好准备。应该进行一次群众性的种子普查工作。人民公社各级干部和社员群众要一起动手，把秋收作物选留下来的种子，按照1960年生产计划检查一下，看看数量够不够？质量好不好？品种对不对？要把实有数和需要数仔细地核对一下，看是否够用。发现不够用，就赶快串换。今年按计划必须推广和更换的新品种，以及为扩大复种和改革耕作制度所需要而本地没有的良种，也要抓紧时间从外地调剂。对于灾区需要补充的种子，领导机关要特别注意给予帮助，保证有足够的数量。人民公社自留的种子和国家贮备的种子，都要做好保管工作，做到四无（无虫、无霉、无鼠雀、无事故）二保（保证纯度、保证发芽率）。对于必须分散保管的种子，更要充分运用群众多年来保管少量种子的经验，保证贮藏安全。
    把土、肥、水等项工作做好了，再把种子工作做好了，就一定可以为今年农业大增产打下胜利的基础；就一定可以掀起一个种子工作大跃进来保证农业生产大跃进。
