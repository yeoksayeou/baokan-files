Launch a Vigorous Technical Revolution to Achieve Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization
Zhao Lizhi, Director of the Industry and Transportation Department of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Taiyuan City's industrial production tasks this year will see a significant increase, and the tasks of trial manufacturing and mass production of new products are also very heavy. In addition, two hundred new and expanded factories, mines, and workshops will be put into production successively. In order to complete these tasks, various enterprises require an increase of more than 70,000 laborers. How to solve this problem?

Taiyuan City's approach is to fully mobilize the masses and carry out a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization. The municipal party committee requires that through this movement, labor productivity be increased by 50%, striving for increased production without increasing manpower in the original production units, and saving 40,000 to 50,000 laborers to support new units. They launched this movement in early December last year, and by the end of the year, according to incomplete statistics, nearly 30,000 laborers had been saved.

This article is an introduction to the experience of Taiyuan City in carrying out this movement.

Increasing Labor Productivity is Imperative

Taiyuan City's industrial production tasks this year will see a significant increase; the tasks of trial manufacturing and mass production of new products are also very heavy. In addition, two hundred new and expanded factories, mines, and workshops will be put into production successively within the year. Under these circumstances, the problem of labor shortage has been raised. According to statistics from the labor department, industrial enterprises throughout the city are requesting an increase of more than 70,000 laborers to continue the great leap forward. How to solve the problem of labor shortage? Is it to tap labor potential from within the enterprises, or to reach out to the state for personnel? Although China has a large population, it is impossible and should not be done to massively request laborers from the countryside before the foundation of agricultural mechanization has been laid. More importantly, it is not in line with the spirit of the general line and the principles of socialist enterprise management to increase production by greatly increasing the labor force. Therefore, the correct path is to seriously tap the internal labor potential of enterprises and rapidly increase labor productivity by realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization, reducing and even eliminating manual operations, and improving labor organization. This is the main way to ensure an all-round leap forward.

Rapidly increasing labor productivity is by no means a temporary expedient. It is a major issue related to the comprehensive technical transformation of industrial enterprises, especially one of the important conditions for socialism to defeat capitalism, build socialism, and even gradually transition to communism in the future. Lenin said: "Capitalism has created a labor productivity that did not exist under the serf system. Capitalism can be completely defeated, and will certainly be completely defeated, because socialism can create new and much higher labor productivity." "After the task of the proletariat seizing power is solved, ... it is necessary to give top priority to the fundamental task of creating a social and economic system higher than capitalist society, which is to increase labor productivity." It is very obvious that if any factory or enterprise, whether new or original, does not seize the opportunity to increase labor productivity, it will not be possible to expand socialist accumulation while increasing social material wealth, and it will not be possible to expand reproduction, and the speed of socialist industrialization will slow down. At the current stage, launching a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization to gradually replace manual labor and heavy physical labor can, on the one hand, save a large number of laborers and put them into more urgently needed production posts; on the other hand, it can greatly reduce labor intensity, making "labor change from a heavy burden to a pleasure", allowing workers to have more time to engage in political and cultural activities, and gradually become laborers with high political consciousness, high cultural level, and technical level, creating conditions for gradually eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor. It can be seen that vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization at present is a matter of extremely far-reaching significance.

Fully tapping the internal labor potential of enterprises and increasing labor productivity is very promising in Taiyuan City. Compared with other industrial cities in the country, Taiyuan City's industrial labor productivity is relatively low. There are many reasons for the low labor productivity. From the internal perspective of enterprises, the main reason is the low technical level, and the main manifestation of the low technical level is the low degree of mechanization. According to a survey of 97 factories and mines in Taiyuan City, production workers engaged in mechanized operations account for about 19.63%, those engaged in semi-mechanized operations account for 22.35%, and those engaged in manual operations account for 58.2%. The degree of mechanization also varies greatly among industries. The metal processing, power, and chemical industries have a relatively high degree of mechanization, but manual operations still account for 33% to 55%; manual operations in the construction, building materials, and smelting industries account for 62% to 93%, and as high as 93.23% in the ceramics industry. The difference in the degree of mechanization between different types of work is also very large. This situation shows that the proportion of manual operations in industrial enterprises in Taiyuan City is still very large in many aspects. This is where the huge labor potential within the enterprises lies. Taiyuan City is an industrial city with a certain foundation, with a considerable number of veteran workers and engineering and technical personnel; the new workers who entered the factory in 1958 have also undergone more than a year of training. As long as these favorable conditions are fully utilized, it is entirely possible to eliminate heavy physical labor in a relatively short period of time, reduce manual operations, gradually realize mechanization, rapidly increase labor productivity, and ensure continued leap forward.

In early December last year, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a plenary (enlarged) meeting and adopted the "Resolution on Launching a Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Movement Centered on Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization." The resolution clearly stated that through this movement, labor productivity should be increased by 50%, striving for increased production without increasing manpower in the original production units, and saving 40,000 to 50,000 laborers to support new units. After the enlarged meeting of the municipal party committee, the broad masses of workers and staff in all walks of life warmly responded to this combat call, and achieved great results in a very short period of time. According to incomplete statistics from 162 units, including Xishan Mining Bureau, Taiyuan Railway Bureau, Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, and Shanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Companies No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, by the end of December last year, a total of more than 30,000 sets (sets, pieces) of various machines and tools had been manufactured and improved. Due to the continuous increase of various indigenous and foreign equipment and machinery, first, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has been greatly improved. For example, the 13 units under the Taiyuan Municipal Machinery Industry Bureau originally had a mechanization and semi-mechanization degree of 34.94%, which reached 49.08% by the end of the year. Second, many units in various industries have completely or basically realized mechanized and semi-mechanized production in all or most of their jobs. According to statistics from 117 units, including Jinxi Machine Factory and Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, there are a total of 1,353 types of work, of which 338 were originally realized mechanized and semi-mechanized production, which increased to 480 by the end of the year. Third, a large number of laborers were saved. According to incomplete statistics from 147 factories and mines, including Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company and Xishan Mining Bureau, nearly 30,000 laborers were saved by the end of last year. Fourth, production efficiency has been improved. According to incomplete statistics from 61 units, including Xing'an Chemical Materials Plant, Xishan Mining Bureau, and Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, the increase in production efficiency is generally one to dozens of times, and even as high as hundreds of times. Fifth, the labor productivity of various enterprises has been significantly improved. The labor productivity of production workers in factories and mines throughout the city increased by an average of 15.83% in November compared with October. In December, it increased by about 15% compared with November.

Approaching from Five Aspects

Taiyuan City carries out technical innovation and technical revolution centered on vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization, focusing on the following aspects:

First, all manual operations should vigorously promote semi-mechanization and mechanization to replace manual operations. In particular, in heavy physical labor departments such as mining, crushing, casting, forging, riveting, loading and unloading, transportation, and lifting, efforts should be made to minimize or even eliminate heavy physical labor in handling aspects such as carrying, pulling, lifting, and picking, hammering, knocking, striking, and swinging in metal material forming, and manual cutting and crushing in raw material processing.

Handicraft industry, street industry, and commune industry are generally manual operations. The content of technical innovation is mainly to be based on the actual situation of the unit, to make use of available resources, rely on one's own efforts, and try to make some simple equipment, use other units' stagnant materials, old equipment, and waste equipment, and gradually realize semi-mechanization.

Second, those who have already realized semi-mechanization should strive to realize mechanization and use electricity as power; those who have already realized partial mechanization should strive to realize overall mechanization; those with a higher degree of mechanization should strive to realize semi-automation and develop towards the direction of automation, continuous operation, combination, and high speed.

Third, make full use of existing equipment to improve equipment utilization. Especially in some newly built and expanded modern factories and mines, it is necessary to train workers to master technology and make full use of advanced equipment, changing the phenomenon of having equipment idle on the one hand and using manual operations to waste a lot of labor on the other hand. While improving the utilization rate of existing equipment, it is also necessary to improve and self-make some key equipment to solve the weak links in production, so as to balance production capacity on the basis of advanced level. Enterprises undertaking large-scale machinery manufacturing tasks should vigorously promote simple large-scale machine tools to overcome the current difficulty of insufficient large-scale processing equipment.

Fourth, extensively mobilize the masses of workers and staff to improve process operations, adopt new processes, and improve tools and equipment; centering on this year's production tasks and new product trial manufacturing tasks, carry out cultural revolution serving technical revolution in a serious, persistent, and in-depth manner. Continuously improve workers' cultural and technical level, gradually master new technologies, strengthen scientific research; comprehensively utilize raw materials, reduce material consumption, improve product design, improve product quality, expand product variety, and strive to increase output value.

Fifth, according to the characteristics of the industry, enterprise, and various types of work, systematically summarize and promote some effective and universally meaningful advanced experiences. In promoting advanced experience, not only should the advanced experience of the factory be summarized and promoted, but also the advanced experience of other factories should be creatively learned and promoted. Special attention should be paid to the matching of advanced experience, and it should be included in process regulations, or determined from the work system.

To carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution centered on vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization, it is necessary to highlight the key points and help the general. It is necessary to focus on production and drive the entire technical work; it is necessary to concentrate efforts to first realize those innovations that are easy to do, have a large effect, save a lot of manpower, are effective quickly, and cost little money, and solve the key problems that urgently need to be solved in production. It is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, spend no money or spend less money, use waste materials, old materials, old equipment, and stagnant materials, transform equipment, innovate technology, and strive to produce practical results in production as soon as possible.

In order to ensure that this movement is carried out quickly and achieves practical results as soon as possible, the most important thing is to adhere to putting politics in command, take anti-rightist and drumming up enthusiasm as the guideline, and fully mobilize the masses. Chairman Mao often taught us: "The working class must transform the entire society in the class struggle and the struggle against nature, and at the same time transform itself." Therefore, we must never understand vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization, carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, as just a technical work, but should realize that this must also be a struggle between advanced and backward ideas. The fact is exactly so. Some people think that "more people are good for doing things, increasing production must increase people"; some people think that "their own conditions are not good, and it is impossible to realize mechanization and semi-mechanization." Some people also think that the level of mechanization in their unit is relatively high, and there is not much potential for technical innovation; even some people oppose vigorously promoting mechanization to current production, fearing that it will "affect" production; and so on. If these ideological "roadblocks" are not eliminated first, it will not be possible to realize mechanization and semi-mechanization at a high speed and achieve increased production without increasing manpower.

In order to make the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement widely and deeply carried out, it is necessary to vigorously promote mass large-scale exercises, large-scale performances, and large-scale competitions. Since entering December in Taiyuan City, the scale of large-scale performances and large-scale exercises has been very grand. There are not only single-person exercises, but also collective exercises; masters practice, and apprentices also practice; workers practice, and technical cadres and leading cadres also practice; advanced producers practice, and ordinary producers also practice; production departments practice, and auxiliary departments also practice; small enterprises practice, and modern enterprises also practice. The content of the exercises is also very rich. On the basis of the exercises, the advantages are concentrated, the experience is matched, and through on-site technical performances, mutual competitions, and learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, the most advanced pacesetters are selected. Carrying out large-scale competitions is actually a process of popularizing and improving advanced experience. It is also a good form to promote the masses' soaring enthusiasm.

Vigorously promoting mechanization must adhere to the principle of "walking on two legs." According to needs and possibilities, if it can be foreign, it should be foreign; if it cannot be foreign, it should be indigenous, and it should be combined with self-reliance and necessary national investment (with self-reliance as the main), combined with large and small, combined with transforming old equipment and adding new equipment (with transformation as the main), combined with creation and promotion, combined with the current and the long-term (with the current as the main), overcoming the incorrect ideas of emphasizing foreign over indigenous, looking at the big but not the small, and simply reaching out for money.

In order to quickly carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, party committees at all levels should strengthen leadership, establish special working bodies, meticulously do organizational work, and clarify the main direction of attack; there should be both long-term plans and short-term arrangements, organize several battles, and realize them in stages and batches; and pay attention to doing technical appraisal, finalization and promotion work, establish mechanization innovation pacesetters, make the experience complete, from point to line, from line to surface, one place blooms, and results everywhere.

    大闹技术革命实现机械化半机械化
    中共太原市委工业交通部长　赵力之
    太原市今年的工业生产任务将有很大增长，新产品的试制和成批生产的任务也很繁重。还有二百个新建和扩建的厂矿、车间陆续投入生产。为了完成这些任务，各个企业要求增加七万多个劳动力。这个问题怎样解决？
    太原市的做法是：充分发动群众，开展以大闹机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。市委要求通过这个运动，把劳动生产率提高50％，力争原有生产单位增产不增人，并且省出四万至五万劳动力，支援新建单位。他们从去年十二月上旬起开展这个运动，到年底，据不完全的统计，已节省了近三万个劳动力。
    本文是太原市开展这一运动的经验介绍。
    提高劳动生产率势在必行
    太原市今年的工业生产任务将有很大的增长；新产品的试制和成批生产的任务也很繁重。此外，还有二百个新建扩建的厂矿和车间年内将陆续投入生产。在这种情况下，劳动力不足的问题就提出来了。据劳动部门的统计，全市各工业企业为继续跃进要求增加的劳动力竟达七万多人。怎样解决劳动力不足的问题？是从企业内部挖掘劳动潜力，还是伸手向国家要人？我国虽然人口众多，但在农业机械化的基础还没有奠定以前，向农村大批要劳动力是不可能的，也是不应该的。更重要的是，企业用大量增加劳动力的办法来提高生产，是不符合总路线的精神和社会主义企业管理原则的。因此，正确的途径是通过实现机械化半机械化，减少以至消灭手工业操作，改善劳动组织，来认真挖掘企业内部的劳动潜力，迅速地提高劳动生产率。这是保证全面跃进的主要途径。
    迅速提高劳动生产率，绝不是一时权宜之计，它是关系到工业企业的全面技术改造的重大问题，特别是社会主义战胜资本主义，建成社会主义以至将来逐步过渡到共产主义的重要条件之一。列宁说过：“资本主义造成了在农奴制度下所没有过的劳动生产率。资本主义可以被彻底战胜，而且一定会被彻底战胜，因为社会主义能造成新的高得多的劳动生产率。”“当无产阶级夺取政权的任务解决以后，……必然要把创造高于资本主义社会的社会经济制度的根本任务，提到首要地位，这个根本任务就是提高劳动生产率。”十分明显，任何一个工厂企业不论是新的，还是原有的，如果不抓紧提高劳动生产率，就不可能在增加社会物质财富的同时，扩大社会主义积累，也就不可能扩大再生产，社会主义工业化的速度也就会放慢。在目前阶段来说，开展以大闹机械化、半机械化的技术革新和技术革命运动，来逐步代替手工劳动和笨重体力劳动，一方面可以节省出大批劳动力，把他们用到更急需的生产岗位上去；另一方面可以大大减轻劳动强度，使“劳动从沉重的负担变成愉快”，使工人有更多的时间从事政治、文化活动，逐步成为具有高度政治觉悟、高度文化水平和技术水平的劳动者，为逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别创造条件。由此可见，当前大闹机械化、半机械化，是具有极为深远意义的事情。
    充分挖掘企业内部的劳动潜力，提高劳动生产率，在太原市来说是大有可为的。同全国其他工业城市比较，太原市的工业劳动生产率是较低的。劳动生产率低的原因很多。从企业内部来讲，主要是技术水平低，而技术水平低的主要表现是机械化程度低。据太原市九十七个厂矿企业的调查，从事机械化操作的生产工人约占19．63％，半机械化操作的占22．35％，手工操作的占58．2％。各行业机械化程度也很悬殊。金属加工、电力、化工等系统机械化程度较高，但手工操作亦占33％至55％；建筑、建筑材料、冶炼等系统手工操作占62％至93％，陶瓷业高达93．23％。不同工种之间的机械化程度差别也很大。这种情况说明，太原市的工业企业在许多环节上手工操作的比例还是很大的。这是企业内部巨大的劳动潜力所在。太原市是一个具有一定基础的工业城市，有相当数量的老工人和工程技术人员；1958年入厂的新工人也经过了一年多的锻炼和培养。只要充分运用这些有利条件，完全有可能在较短的时间内消灭笨重体力劳动，减少手工操作，逐步实现机械化，迅速提高劳动生产率，保证继续跃进。
    去年12月上旬，中共太原市委举行全体（扩大）会议，通过了“关于开展以机械化和半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动的决议”。决议中明确地提出：通过这一运动要提高劳动生产率50％，力争原有生产单位增产不增人，并节省出四万至五万劳动力，支援新建单位。市委扩大会议以后，各行各业的广大职工群众热烈响应这一战斗号召，而且在很短时间内就收到很大效果。据西山矿务局、太原铁路办事处、太原重型机器厂、山西省建筑工程一、二、三、四、五公司等一百六十二个单位的不完全统计，到去年12月底，共制造和改进各种机械、工具三万多台（套、件）。由于各种土洋设备和机具的不断增加，第一，机械化、半机械化程度有了很大的提高。如市机械工业局所属十三个单位，原来机械化、半机械化程度为34．94％，到年底达到49．08％。第二，各行业中都有不少单位的工种全部或基本上实现了机械化、半机械化生产。据晋西机器厂、山西机床厂等一百一十七个单位统计，共有工种一千三百五十三个，其中原来已实现机械化半机械化生产的是三百三十八个，到年底增加到四百八十个。第三，节约了大批劳动力。据太原钢铁公司、西山矿务局等一百四十七个厂矿企业的不完全统计，到去年年底共节省下劳动力近三万个。第四，提高了生产效率。据兴安化学材料厂、西山矿务局、山西机床厂等六十一个单位的不完全统计，提高生产效率一般都在一倍至几十倍，甚至高达数百倍。第五，各企业的劳动生产率有了显著提高。全市厂矿企业生产工人劳动生产率11月份比10月份平均提高15．83％。12月份又比11月份提高15％左右。
      从五个方面着手
    太原市开展以大闹机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命，是着重从以下几个方面着手的：
    第一，凡是使用手工操作的，要大搞半机械化机械化，以代替手工操作。特别是采掘、破碎、铸造、锻铆、装卸、运输、起重等笨重体力劳动部门，要尽量缩小以至消灭搬运方面的背、拉、扛、抬、提、挑，金属材料成型方面的砸、敲、锤、打、抡，原料加工方面的人工切料、粉碎等笨重体力劳动。
    手工业、街道工业、公社工业，一般都是手工操作，技术革新的内容，主要是根据本单位实际情况，因陋就简，自力更生，尽可能搞一些简易设备，利用其他单位的呆滞物资、旧设备和废设备，逐步实现半机械化。
    第二，凡已实现半机械化的应力争实现机械化，用电力作动力；已实现局部机械化的力争实现全盘机械化；机械化程度较高的力争实现半自动化，并向自动化、连续化、组合化和高速化的方向发展。
    第三，充分利用现有设备，提高设备利用率。特别是在一些新建扩建的现代化厂矿中，要培养工人掌握技术，把先进设备充分利用起来，改变那种一方面有设备闲置不用，而另一方面却使用手工操作浪费大量劳动力的现象。在提高现有设备利用率的同时，还针对生产中的薄弱环节，改进和自制一些关键性设备，以求在先进水平的基础上平衡生产能力。担负大型机械制造任务的企业，大搞简易大型机床，以克服目前大型加工设备不足的困难。
    第四，广泛发动职工群众改进工艺操作，采用新工艺、改进工具、设备；围绕今年的生产任务和新产品试制任务，认真地、持久地、深入地开展为技术革命服务的文化革命。不断提高工人的文化技术水平，逐步掌握新技术，加强科学研究；综合利用原材料，降低材料消耗，改进产品设计，提高产品质量，扩大产品品种，努力提高产值。
    第五，根据本行业本企业和各个工种的特点，系统地总结推广一些行之有效的、带有普遍意义的先进经验。在推广先进经验中，不仅要总结推广本厂的，而且要创造性地学习和推广外厂的。特别应注意先进经验配套，并应纳入工艺规程，或从工作制度上确定下来。
    开展以大搞机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命，既要突出重点，又要帮助一般。必须围绕生产，把整个技术工作带动起来；必须集中力量首先实现那些容易搞、效果大、省人多、收效快、花钱少的革新和解决在生产上迫切需要解决的关键问题。要充分发动群众，不花钱或少花钱，利用废料、旧料、旧设备和呆滞物资，改装设备，革新技术，力争在生产上尽快地产生实效。
    为了保证这个运动迅速地开展起来，尽快地取得实效，最重要的是：坚持政治挂帅，以反右倾鼓干劲为纲，充分地发动群众。毛主席经常教导我们：“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。”因此，绝不能把大闹机械化、半机械化，开展技术革新和技术革命，仅仅理解为一项技术工作，而应该认识到，这同时必然是一场先进思想同落后思想的斗争。事实也正是如此。有些人认为：“人多好办事，增产必增人”；有些人认为“自己条件不好，无法实现机械化、半机械化”。又有些人认为本单位机械化水平较高，技术革新的油水不大了；甚至有些把大搞机械化同当前生产对立起来，唯恐“影响”生产；等等。如果不首先打掉这些思想上的“拦路虎”，就不可能高速度地实现机械化半机械化，做到增产不增人。
    为了使群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动广泛而深入地开展起来，必须大搞群众性的大练武、大表演、大比武。太原市进入12月份以来，大表演，大练武的规模十分宏大，不仅有单人练武，也有集体练武；师傅练武，徒弟也练武；工人练武，技术干部和领导干部也练武，先进生产者练武，普通生产者也练武；生产部门练武，辅助部门也练武；小企业练武，现代化企业也练武。练武的内容也非常丰富。在练武的基础上，集中优点，经验配套，通过现场技术表演，互相比赛，取长补短，从而选拔出最先进的标兵。进行大比武，实际上是先进经验普及与提高的过程。也是发扬群众冲天干劲的好形式。
    大闹机械化，必须坚持贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针。根据需要和可能，能洋就洋，不能洋就土，并应以自力更生和国家必要投资相结合（以自力更生为主），大型和小型相结合，改造旧设备和添置新设备相结合（以改造为主），创造与推广相结合，目前与长远相结合（以目前为主），克服重洋轻土、看大不看小、单纯伸手要钱等不正确的思想。　　为了迅速地开展以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，各级党委要加强领导，成立专门的办事机构，细致地做好组织工作，明确主攻方向；既有长计划，又有短安排，组织几个战役，分期分批实现；并注意做好技术鉴定，定型推广工作，树立机械化革新的标兵，使经验成套，由点到线，由线到面，一处开花，遍地结果。
