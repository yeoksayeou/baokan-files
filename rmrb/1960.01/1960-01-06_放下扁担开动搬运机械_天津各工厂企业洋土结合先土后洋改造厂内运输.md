    Putting Down Carrying Poles and Starting Up Transport Machinery
    Tianjin Factories and Enterprises Combine Foreign and Indigenous Methods, Prioritizing Indigenous Methods Before Foreign Methods to Transform Internal Transport
    (Our newspaper, Tianjin, 5th dispatch) The transport departments of various factories and enterprises in Tianjin are vigorously promoting the mechanization and semi-mechanization of transport, freeing thousands of transport workers from heavy physical labor, and initially resolving the contradiction between modern production and backward manual transport.
    Now, in Tianjin, transport workers are putting down carrying poles and baskets, and starting up various transport machines. Workers only need to press a button or pull a lever, and the self-made simple cranes and pulleys quickly and nimbly transport large and heavy steel and machinery to where they are needed. At bulk cargo handling yards, power shovels and belt conveyors rumble, and materials such as coal and sand flow continuously. In some machinery factories, electric vehicles and indigenous-style trains run back and forth. Light industrial factories have established conveyor belts and aerial cableways between various processes. The chemical and pharmaceutical industries have also achieved pipeline flow for liquids, with some factories achieving a pipeline rate of over 98%. After mechanization and semi-mechanization, many workers write poems and draw pictures to praise the benefits of mechanization. Liu Fengtong, a veteran transport worker at the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant, wrote: "Technical innovation is powerful, physical operations are mechanized, jumping off the yellow ox to ride a steed, the whole factory blooms with leaping progress."
    One of the most significant effects of the mechanization of transport in Tianjin's factories and enterprises is the liberation of labor, the improvement of work efficiency, and the closer connection of various processes. For a long time, manual transport within factories and enterprises has been a weak link. The production of factories uses modern machines, and the transportation sector uses modern transportation tools with large traction, high load capacity, and fast speed to transport raw materials and finished products to factories. Only the transport within factories and enterprises still relies mostly on manual labor, forming a situation of "modernization at both ends, manual operation in the middle." According to preliminary investigations in the metallurgical system, transport workers account for 60% of the entire production process, and most materials are transported to various workshops by them carrying, lifting, shouldering, and pulling, which is tiring for workers and has low efficiency. In Tianjin, the time it takes for trucks to wait for loading and unloading accounts for half of the total transportation time. Some factories have even been affected in their production because manual transport is not timely. After the Tianjin Aluminum Products Factory used three self-made conveyor belts, it replaced the heavy labor of more than a dozen transport workers, not only improving transport efficiency by 30% to 70%, but also solving the problem of parts blockage that often occurred in the past.
    In the process of implementing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of transport work, Tianjin's factories and enterprises have widely carried out mass movements, adopting a method of combining foreign and indigenous methods, with indigenous methods as the main focus, and prioritizing indigenous methods before foreign methods. Transport workers have a high level of enthusiasm, offering suggestions and ideas, and automatically establishing "innovation assault teams" and "amateur processing plants" to tackle key problems. They try their best to overcome difficulties. If they don't have steel, they use bamboo skin and wood; if they lack rubber, they use canvas instead; if they don't have enameled pipes, they use ceramic pipes. Workers at the Tianjin Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory have self-made ten conveyor belts of curved, bridge, and ladder types, changing the transport of parts between processes in the whole factory from manual labor to conveyor belt operation. These conveyor belts were all made by workers using waste materials.

### 放下扁担开动搬运机械  天津各工厂企业洋土结合先土后洋改造厂内运输

    放下扁担开动搬运机械
    天津各工厂企业洋土结合先土后洋改造厂内运输
    本报天津5日电　天津市各工厂企业的搬运部门，大闹搬运机械化、半机械化，使成千上万的搬运工人从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来，并且初步解决了现代化生产与落后的人力搬运之间的矛盾。
    现在，天津市有些工厂的搬运工人正纷纷放下扁担和大筐，开动起各种搬运机械，工人们只要一捺电钮或一扳把手，那些自制的简易吊车和滑车，就迅速地把大件笨重的钢材、机械，轻巧地送到需要的地方。在散装货搬运场上，电铲和皮带运输机隆隆作响，煤炭和沙石等各种物料像流水般地源源奔去。在一些机械工厂里，电瓶车和土火车来往不断。轻工业工厂在各个工序间建立起传送带和空中索道。化学、制药行业也实现了液体流程管道化，有的厂管道化的程度已达98％以上。机械化、半机械化以后，许多工人写诗作画，歌颂机械化的好处。天津第一钢厂运输老工人刘风桐写道：“技术革新威力大，体力操作机械化，跳下黄牛骑骏马，全厂盛开跃进花。”
    天津市各工厂企业实现搬运机械化的一个最显著的作用是解放劳动力，提高工作效率，使各工序衔接得更加紧密。长时期以来，工厂企业内部的人力搬运是薄弱环节。工厂的生产是使用现代化的机器，交通运输部门为工厂运送原料、成品，是使用牵引力大、载重量多、速度快的近代运输工具，只有工厂企业内部的搬运，还大部分靠人力，形成“两头现代化、中间手工操作”的局面。据冶金系统的初步调查，在全部生产过程中，搬运工人就占60％，绝大部分的物料是靠他们背、抬、扛、拉运送到各个车间，工人既累，效率也低。天津市市内运输汽车等待装卸和进行装卸的时间要占整个运输时间的一半。有些工厂还因为人力运送不及时而影响生产。天津铝品制造厂使用了工人自制的三条传送带以后，代替了十几个搬运工人的笨重劳动，不仅提高搬运效率30％到70％，而且解决了过去经常发生的部件堵塞现象。
    天津市各工厂企业在实行搬运工作机械化、半机械化的过程中，广泛开展了群众运动，采取了土洋结合，以土为主，先土后洋的办法。搬运工人热情高涨，纷纷献计献策，自动建立了“革新突击队”、“业余加工厂”，猛攻关键。他们千方百计地克服困难，没有钢铁就用竹皮、木头，缺少胶皮就以帆布代替，没有搪磁管就用陶磁管。天津大中华橡胶厂工人自制了曲型、桥型、梯型的十条传送带，使全厂工序间部件的搬运由人力改变为传送带化。这些传送带全部是由工人用废旧料制成的。
