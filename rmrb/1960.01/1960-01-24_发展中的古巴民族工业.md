    Developing Cuban National Industry
    Kong Mai
    Based on the implementation of land reform, Cuba is vigorously developing its national industries.
    In 1959, some new factories appeared in Cuba, including vegetable oil pressing plants, artificial nitric acid plants, and other factories using bagasse to manufacture newsprint, wrapping paper, cardboard, artificial wood, and tiles. Some cooperatives, established less than a year ago, have already started exporting canned fish. Currently, Cuba produces fertilizers that, in addition to meeting its own needs, can also be exported to countries such as Mexico.
    In the half-century before the revolution, American monopoly capital controlled Cuba's sugar production and important economic and transportation sectors such as railways, aviation, and mining. After the victory of the revolution, the Cuban government, in order to break free from the control of American monopoly capital, began to use domestic capital to develop the national economy. The source of this capital was mainly the confiscated property of the Batista elements and counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, the Cuban government also relies on donations from the people and the profits turned over by cooperatives as a fund for developing national industries. For example, the Cuban Workers' Confederation decided at a recent meeting to donate 4% of wages for the government to use to develop the economy.
    The money saved by replacing imports with domestic products is also used to develop industry. For example, Cuban producers could originally only meet 60% to 70% of textile consumption, and even then, these textiles were woven from imported cotton. However, in 1959, Cuba expanded its planting area, and cotton production increased tenfold compared to 1958. The new planting plan aims to achieve self-sufficiency in cotton within two years. Coupled with a large textile factory that the government will build this year, Cuba can save the 30 to 35 million US dollars in foreign exchange spent annually on importing cotton and textiles.
    Cuba's economic plan for developing national industries stipulates the establishment of cottonseed oil pressing plants in order to overcome the phenomenon of having to import 9 million US dollars worth of vegetable oil annually within two or three years due to the insufficient production capacity of existing cottonseed oil plants. The government will also build a dairy product factory, whose output will be able to meet domestic consumption, without having to spend 3 million US dollars annually to import dairy products. A new flour mill currently under construction will save 8 to 9 million US dollars in flour imports. Cuba imports flour because the flour produced by the existing two flour mills cannot meet the needs of the people. For the same purpose, the government will also establish some food canning factories.
    This year, the Cuban government will build a livestock feed factory and a bagasse plastics factory. The latter will manufacture pipes for water diversion and irrigation. Cubans are experimenting with turning bagasse into coal and will use rice husks to manufacture textiles. In addition, the National Land Reform Institute has purchased agave plantations and fiber factories. This year, the production of agave fiber will increase from 19.5 million pounds to 24 million pounds.
    Cuba is a country with abundant mineral resources. Nickel reserves rank first in the world. In addition, there are iron, manganese, copper, cobalt, and chromium, etc., all of which are controlled by American imperialists. The mining law and petroleum law promulgated by the Cuban government last year provided convenient conditions for restoring the sovereignty of these mineral deposits.
    The Cuban government has decided to establish mineral, metallurgical, power, fuel, and chemical industries within two or three years, and these industries will be run by the state. It is expected that steel production will reach 500,000 tons during this period (current production is less than 50,000 tons), in order to manufacture agricultural machinery with its own steel. The government will also establish an electrolytic copper factory, while currently, only the American "Feldrake" company can produce electrolytic copper.
    American monopoly capitalists are doing everything possible to obstruct the Cuban government's plan to develop industry. American technicians falsely claim that Cuba has no oil, with the aim of continuing to export 80 million US dollars worth of oil and petroleum products to Cuba every year. However, under the enthusiastic labor of Cuban exploration personnel, the oil well recently drilled in Hatibonico has already gushed out oil, with an initial daily production of 1,600 barrels (more than the total production of all other wells). In Pinar del Río, farmers have also discovered oil, which they use as fuel. The government's power plan stipulates the construction of the first domestic oil refinery. The current three refineries are controlled by Mobil Oil, Texaco, and Shell Oil.
    Currently, the Cuban government is developing foreign trade with countries around the world, especially socialist countries. Cuban technicians believe that developing trade with these countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit will help Cuba obtain the equipment and technical assistance necessary for developing national industries.

    发展中的古巴民族工业
    孔迈
    古巴在实行土地改革的基础上，正在大力发展本国的民族工业。
    1959年，古巴出现了一些新的工厂，其中有植物油榨制厂、人造硝酸厂以及其他一些用甘蔗渣制造报纸、包装纸、硬纸板厂，人造木和瓦片的工厂。有些成立还不到一年的合作社，已经开始出口鱼类罐头。目前，古巴生产的肥料，除自给外还可以向墨西哥等国输出。
    在革命胜利前的半个世纪中，美国垄断资本控制了古巴糖的生产和铁路、航空、矿业等重要经济和运输部门。革命胜利以后，古巴政府为了摆脱美国垄断资本的控制，开始利用本国资本来发展国民经济。这些资本的来源，主要是被没收的巴蒂斯塔分子以及反革命分子的财产。同时，古巴政府还依靠人民的捐献以及合作社的上缴利润，作为发展民族工业的基金。例如，古巴工人联合会在最近举行的会议上决定捐献4％的工资供政府发展经济之用。
    由本国产品代替进口而节约下来的钱也用来发展工业。例如，原来古巴的生产者只能满足60％—70％的纺织品消费，即使如此，这些纺织品还是用进口棉花织成的。但是，1959年古巴扩大了播种面积，棉花的产量比1958年增加了十倍。新的种植计划是要在二年内达到棉花的自给自足。再加上政府今年将建立的一个大纺织厂，古巴就可以把每年用于进口棉花和纺织品的三千万至三千五百万美元的外汇节省下来。
    古巴发展民族工业的经济计划，规定要建立棉籽油榨制厂，以便在两三年内克服由于现有的棉籽油厂的生产供不应求所造成的每年不得不进口九百万美元的植物油的现象。政府并将兴建一个乳制品工厂，它的产量将能满足国内消费，而用不着每年花三百万美元去进口乳制品。正在兴建的一个新的磨粉厂将节省八、九百万美元的面粉进口。古巴之所以进口面粉，是因为现有的两个磨粉厂生产的面粉满足不了人民的需要。为了同样的目的，政府也将建立一些食品罐头厂。
    今年，古巴政府将建立一个牲畜饲料厂和蔗渣塑料厂。后者将制造供引水和灌溉用的管子。古巴人正在作甘蔗渣变成煤的试验，并且将采用稻子壳来制造纺织品。此外，土地改革全国委员会已经购买了龙舌兰种植园和纤维厂。今年，龙舌兰纤维的生产将从一千九百五十万磅增加到二千四百万磅。
    古巴是一个有丰富的矿产资源的国家。镍的储藏量占世界第一位。此外还有铁、锰、铜、钴和铬等，这些矿藏都控制在美帝国主义者手里。古巴政府去年颁布的矿业法和石油法，为恢复这些矿藏的主权提供了便利条件。
    古巴政府已经决定在两三年内建立矿产、冶金、动力、燃料和化学工业，这些工业将由国家来兴办。预计钢的产量在这段时期内将达到五十万吨（目前的产量不到五万吨），以便用自己炼的钢制造农业机器。政府还将建立一所电解铜工厂，而在目前，电解铜只有美国“费耳德雷克”公司能够生产。
    美国垄断资本家千方百计地企图阻挠古巴政府发展工业的计划。美国技术人员胡说什么古巴没有石油，目的是每年继续向古巴出口价值八千万美元的石油和石油产品。但是，在古巴的勘探人员的热情劳动下，最近在哈蒂沃尼科钻探的油井已经喷出了石油，开始时的日产量为一千六百桶（比所有其他井的总产量还多）。在比纳莱斯，农民也发现了石油，他们把它当燃料使用。政府的动力计划规定兴建第一个本国的石油冶炼厂。目前的三家冶炼厂，是控制在美孚油公司、德士古石油公司和壳牌石油公司的手里。
    目前古巴政府正在向世界各国特别是社会主义国家开展对外贸易。古巴技术人员认为，同这些国家在平等互利的基础上发展贸易，将帮助古巴得到为发展民族工业所必需的设备和技术援助。
