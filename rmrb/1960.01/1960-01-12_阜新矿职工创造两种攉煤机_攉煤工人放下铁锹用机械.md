    Fuxin Mine Workers Create Two Types of Coal Loading Machines
    Coal Loading Workers Put Down Their Shovels and Use Machines
    (Our dispatch) Fuxin Mining District workers have recently successfully created and widely promoted two types of coal loading machines, greatly reducing the physical labor of miners, improving production efficiency, and realizing the long-cherished wish of coal miners to "put down their shovels." This is a major technological innovation in the coal industry.
    The coal mines under the Fuxin Mining District are all modern, large-scale mines. The entire production process from coal mining to transportation and hoisting is basically mechanized. However, the process of loading the mined coal onto scraper conveyors—coal loading—is still heavy physical labor. Coal miners, bending over and shoveling coal, would be covered in sweat in less than ten minutes. To eliminate this heavy physical labor and achieve mechanized coal loading, there are two ways: one is to rely on the state to supply the latest coal mining technology and equipment (such as electric shovels or hydraulic equipment), but the state cannot equip all mines in a short period of time. The other way is to make do with whatever is available, rely on our own efforts, and use a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to create mechanical equipment that costs less, uses fewer materials, and can be widely promoted and used.
    The workers of the Fuxin Xinqiu Mine Repair Factory, recognizing that the latter approach was more practical, under the leadership of the factory's Party branch secretary, implemented a "three-way combination" of leading cadres, workers, and engineering technicians. They visited underground work sites, compared twelve coal loading machine plans, and finally used waste materials and old materials to trial-produce a簸箕 (boji - winnowing basket) style coal loading machine. This coal loading machine, equipped with a small electric motor, can be operated by one person to load fifteen tons of coal per hour, equivalent to the workload of three to six people. Subsequently, the electrical and mechanical department workers of Ping'an Mine created a simpler "chain-type" coal loading machine that does not require the assembly of power equipment. Two people can operate it, and the work efficiency is equivalent to the coal loading volume of four to five people.
    These two types of coal loading machines are easy to manufacture, low in cost (the cost of making a chain-type coal loading machine is only a little over eleven yuan), and do not require much steel. General coal mine repair factories can manufacture them; and they are lightweight, easy to use, and easy to operate. They can be used in general coal mining work areas. Therefore, once they appeared, they were quickly and widely promoted throughout the mining area. After these two types of coal loading machines were promoted and used in the Fuxin mines, a new situation immediately emerged in production. In the past, sixteen people used shovels to load coal in the Fourth采区 (caiqu - mining area) of Ping'an Mine, averaging eighty carts of coal per shift, and they were exhausted. Now, eight people operate four coal loading machines, producing 164 carts of coal per shift, and they are not very tired. The average daily output of the entire采区 (caiqu - mining area) increased by 23%; the number of shovel workers was reduced from sixteen to nine.
    From the end of November to December 20 last year, the entire mine has produced more than 500 coal loading machines. Twenty-seven pit entrances and采区 (caiqu - mining area) of the three mines in the entire mining area have used coal loading machines, basically realizing mechanized coal loading. Recently, the three major coal mines in Liaoning Province, Fushun, Benxi, and Beipiao, have sent people to Fuxin to visit and learn. The Ministry of Coal Industry is also preparing to vigorously promote this experience of the Fuxin Mine.

### 阜新矿职工创造两种攉煤机  攉煤工人放下铁锹用机械

    阜新矿职工创造两种攉煤机
    攉煤工人放下铁锹用机械
    本报讯　阜新矿区职工最近创制成功和普遍推广了两种攉煤机，大大减轻了矿工的体力劳动，提高了生产效率，实现了采煤工人多少年向往的“放下铁锹”的愿望。这是煤炭工业的一项重大的技术革新。
    阜新矿区所属的煤矿，都是现代化的大型矿井，从采煤到运输、提升的整个生产过程基本上是机械化的，可是，把采下来的煤装上刮板运输机——攉煤这一道工序还是笨重体力劳动。采煤工人躬着腰用铁锹攉煤不到十分钟，就会累得满头大汗。要消除这项笨重体力劳动，实现攉煤机械化，有两个途径，一个是依靠国家供给最新式的采煤技术装备（例如电铲或水力设备），可是国家不可能在很短时间内把所有矿井都装备起来。另一途径是因陋就简，自力更生，用土洋结合的办法，创造那种花钱少、用料省而又能够普遍推广使用的机械设备。
    阜新新丘矿制修厂职工因为认识到后一途径更为切实可行，就由厂党支部书记挂帅，实行领导干部、工人和工程技术人员三结合，到井下参观访问，比较了十二种攉煤机方案，最后用废料旧料试制成了簸箕式攉煤机。这种装有小型电动机的攉煤机一个人操纵，一小时能攉煤十五吨，相当于三个到六个人工的工作量。接着，平安矿机电部门职工，又制成一种更简便的、不需要装配动力设备的“链式”攉煤机，两个人操纵，工效相当于四个到五个人工的攉煤量。
    这两种攉煤机制造简便、成本低廉（做一台链式攉煤机的成本才十一元多），也不费多少钢材，一般煤矿机修厂都可以制造；而且轻便好使，容易操作，一般采煤工作面都可以使用。因此它一经出现，很快就在全矿区普遍推广。这两种攉煤机在阜新各矿推广使用后，生产上立即出现了新局面。平安矿四采区，以前十六个人用铁锹攉煤，每一班平均出煤八十车，累得满头大汗；现在八个人操纵四台攉煤机，一个班出煤一百六十四车，并不怎么费劲。整个采区平均日产量提高了23％；攉锹工人却由十六人减少到九人。
    从去年11月底到12月20日，全矿已经制出攉煤机五百多台，全矿区三个矿的二十七个坑口和采区都用上了攉煤机，基本上实现了攉煤机械化。最近辽宁省抚顺、本溪、北票三大煤矿都派人到阜新参观学习。煤炭工业部也准备大力推广阜新矿的这一经验。
