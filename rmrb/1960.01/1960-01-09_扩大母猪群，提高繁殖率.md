  Expanding the sow herd, massively breeding piglets, and overcoming the difficulty of insufficient pig sources is an extremely important measure in the current high-speed development of the pig industry.
    All regions of the country are paying close attention to the work of selecting and retaining sows. According to statistics from eleven provinces and regions, including Shandong and Shanxi, the number of adult sows in November last year increased by 14.7% compared to October. The slogan "Keep every sow, select after keeping," proposed by provinces, cities, and districts such as Zhejiang, Shanghai, Fujian, Henan, and Guangxi, is the main method for expanding the sow herd. They mobilized the masses to raise all young female pigs to adulthood, breed them to produce a litter of piglets, and then decide whether to keep the sow for breeding based on the strength of the piglets and the survival rate of the offspring, gradually selecting the superior and eliminating the inferior to achieve improved breeds. This method of selecting the good from the general, and combining the good with the general, is entirely in line with China's current objective requirements. Because the current problem is to first meet the needs of breeding in terms of quantity. Will keeping every sow and selecting after one litter allow inferior breeds to pass themselves off as superior, affecting the quality of future generations? Good seeds produce strong seedlings, and large sows produce fat piglets. A sow that has given birth to one litter can be judged to be of a good breed or an inferior breed by observing the piglets. If it is an inferior breed that is not suitable for breeding, simply raise the sow and the piglets as meat pigs, and the inferior breed will not be passed on. On the other hand, the quality of animal and plant varieties is not absolute. Any good breed has certain shortcomings, and any inferior breed that has been able to survive to the present must have certain advantages. Moreover, the distinction between superior and inferior can change with changing conditions, especially through hybridization and proper feeding management, which can transform inferior breeds into superior breeds. Barnyard grass is a plant of the same family as rice. When rice grows mixed with it, it has a great destructive effect on the growth of rice, so people pull out barnyard grass whenever they see it. However, Comrade Yang Minghan of Guangdong used barnyard grass from Guizhou to crossbreed with the "Xinfan" rice variety, and cultivated the "Xinfan Guibai" thousand-grain ear good variety. This is the best proof. Therefore, keeping every sow and selecting after keeping is an advanced method for rapidly expanding the sow herd and rapidly developing pig production at present. Many regions have done this, and all regions of the country should do the same.
    How can we do a good job of keeping every sow and selecting after keeping quickly and well? The news published in this newspaper today that Huangyan County, Zhejiang, increased its sows by two and a half times in two and a half months provides an important experience: the method of combining leading cadres, the masses, and technicians to appraise and select sows pen by pen and head by head. Experience has proved that selecting and retaining sows, like any other work, can achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results by adhering to the principle of putting politics in command and launching a vigorous mass movement. If we rely only on a few veterinarians and castration personnel to appraise and select sows, and do not pay attention to doing a good job in political and ideological work and mobilizing the masses to participate, it will be difficult to meet the requirements.
    To expand the sow herd, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of self-selection, self-retention, self-breeding, and self-raising to ensure a sufficient source of pigs, breed improved varieties, prevent diseases, and thus ensure the realization of the unit's pig industry development plan. Now, all parts of the country are vigorously developing pig production. Relying on a few areas to supply piglets is obviously far from meeting the objective requirements. The fundamental way to solve the source of pigs is self-breeding and self-raising. The large-scale operation of pig farms by people's communes throughout the country and the implementation of the policy of giving priority to public breeding and combining public and private breeding have created extremely favorable conditions for solving the source of pigs through self-breeding and self-raising. Now many pig farms in communes and production teams have selected, retained and raised a large number of sows, or have established specialized pig farms for breeding pigs, and have established sow breeding bases for breeding piglets. The Wantou Pig Farm of Zhangpo Brigade, Huiqiang People's Commune, Shangshui County, Henan Province, has nearly doubled the number of sows in one year. All of the farm's more than 700 sows are pregnant, averaging ten piglets per litter, all of which survive, so that the amount of meat pigs raised has increased by more than seven times compared with the same period last year, and at the same time, it has also supported fraternal communes and teams with a batch of piglets. Self-breeding and self-raising not only fundamentally solves the problem of pig sources, but also facilitates the breeding and improvement of good pig breeds. Good breeds of pigs account for more than 80% of the current sows in this pig farm. It can all be realized in 1960. Facts have proved that only by resolutely implementing the policy of self-breeding and self-raising can the rapid development of the pig industry be fully guaranteed.
    State-owned farms and people's communes throughout the country should select and breed their own sows and raise their own piglets according to their own plans for developing pig production, completely solve the problem of pig sources, ensure that the needs of pig industry development are met, and gradually achieve improved breeds. Of course, due to different conditions in various places, the development of sows will be fast or slow, and mutual support of piglets between communes, teams, and teams is still necessary, especially at present, communes and teams with a good foundation for raising sows and breeding piglets should carry forward the communist style and provide all-round support to help communes and teams with a poor foundation solve the difficulties in pig sources. But the most important thing is to require these communes and teams to go all out and strive to achieve self-selection, self-breeding, and self-raising in a relatively short period of time.
    As mentioned earlier, all parts of the country are now paying attention to selecting and retaining sows to expand the sow herd, but some comrades still have some concerns and incorrect understanding about raising more sows. They believe that "sows take a long time to raise, the cost is high, and it is not cost-effective to lose money"; "there is a lack of concentrated feed, and sows cannot be raised well." In fact, raising sows will not only not lose money, but will also greatly benefit the income of communes, production teams, and commune members. A sow is raised from a small age for about half a year, bred and pregnant, and gives birth to the first litter in about nine months. Based on the general calculation of ten piglets per litter, it can be sold for about 100 yuan after raising it for a month. In these more than ten months, the sow needs to be fed about 100 kilograms of concentrated feed, plus various coarse feeds, the value of which is about 10 yuan, and the cost of buying piglets is also about 10 yuan. The feed cost for each piglet raised for more than half a month after birth is about 2 yuan. The fertilizer of sows and piglets can roughly offset the labor costs of raising them. In this way, from raising a sow from a young age to giving birth to the first litter of piglets, if all are sold, a profit of about 60 yuan can be made, which will only be more than the income of raising a meat pig in the same period. If the sow is well raised, the "piglets" will give birth to piglets again in the second year, and about forty or fifty piglets can be produced, and the profit will be even greater. After the Xiayan Production Team in Pujiang County, Zhejiang Province, raised dozens of sows, it produced more than 1,300 piglets in one year. In addition to self-raising, more than 1,100 were sold to support other teams, with a total income of 10,500 yuan, deducting costs, with a net profit of more than 5,000 yuan. It can be seen from this that it is unfounded to say that raising sows is not cost-effective and will lose money.
    Can sows be raised well without concentrated feed? Many communes have long given affirmative answers to this question with facts. Sows do need to be fed more concentrated feed than ordinary meat pigs, but they should still be mainly fed green and coarse feed. The stems, roots, and leaves of crops are very rich in nutrition, and green feed contains all kinds of vitamins, which help the growth and development of sows and improve their reproductive ability. The more green feed they eat, the faster they grow and develop, and they can also avoid diseases such as infertility and miscarriage. As long as we achieve fine feeding of coarse feed, fermentation feeding of green feed, and reasonable matching, the nutrition of green and coarse feed is no less than that of concentrated feed. Experienced pig-raising people say well: Coarse feed, chopped and cooked, is concentrated feed. As the saying goes: "Three points of feed, seven points of feeding", that is the truth.
    On the other hand, sows in the late stages of pregnancy and during lactation need appropriately matched concentrated feed, but it does not necessarily have to be grain and rice bran. In fact, the concentrated feed that is now matched is diverse, such as bean dregs, bran, corn cobs, rape stalks, etc. are all used as concentrated feed. The Nanshan Production Team of the Xihu Commune in Hangzhou City adopted the method of "sows that are not pregnant eat from the big pot, pregnant sows eat from the middle pot, and lactating sows eat from the small pot" to allocate feed according to different periods. The sows and piglets have not been fed a pound of grain, but the sows are all pregnant and the piglets are all healthy. Therefore, comrades who emphasize that raising sows will lose money and that it is difficult to raise them well due to lack of concentrated feed need to further humbly learn from advanced experiences and strive to overcome various difficulties, so that they can rapidly expand the sow herd and catch up with or surpass advanced units.
    After expanding the sow herd, we must vigorously grasp the breeding work, increase the conception rate of adult sows, achieve full breeding and full conception, and improve reproductive capacity. In this regard, many good experiences have emerged in various places, such as establishing a sow card system to register the breeding situation head by head and check at any time, and at the same time adopting advanced breeding methods such as drug estrus induction, artificial insemination, and multiple breeding, double breeding, repeated breeding, and mixed breeding, so that every sow is bred, every sow is pregnant, and every litter is highly productive.
    After expanding the sow herd, how to correspondingly select and retain boars is also an important issue. Now many regions are selecting and retaining good breed boars according to the ratio of one to thirty. At the same time, in the current situation of insufficient boars, vigorously adopting artificial insemination and other methods to improve the utilization rate of good breed boars is very necessary. After adopting artificial insemination, one boar can breed two or three hundred sows. At the same time, because artificial insemination can accurately grasp the estrus period of sows and carry out timely breeding, it can improve the conception rate of sows. In addition, it can also reduce the spread of pig diseases. Some people say that artificial insemination is the most economical, effective, and rapid method for breeding and improving pig breeds, which is not false at all.
    After the sow is bred, it is also necessary to do a good job in protecting the fetus. After the piglets are born, they must be carefully cared for. That is to say, after achieving full breeding and full conception, we must also achieve full production, full survival, and full strength. In this regard, many excellent feeders have created good experiences. Li Xiuzhen, a feeder at the pig farm of Lucun Brigade, Miaohuang Commune, Shilong County, Guangxi, created the experience of one sow producing nine litters in three years, averaging twelve piglets per litter, all surviving and all being fat and strong. Henan, Zhejiang, and other provinces have discovered high-yield records of sows producing 38 piglets in one litter, all surviving. These examples show that under the encouragement and careful cultivation of the feeders, it is entirely possible to achieve full breeding, multiple litters, and high yields for sows. We should attach great importance to the advanced experiences of various places, introduce and promote them in a timely manner, and strive for all sows to be fully bred, multi-littered, and high-yielding. Ensure that the pig industry will be more prosperous in 1960!

### 扩大母猪群，提高繁殖率

    扩大母猪群，提高繁殖率
    扩大母猪群，大量繁殖小猪，克服猪源不足的困难，是当前高速度发展养猪业中的一个极其重要的措施。
    全国各地很注意选留母猪的工作。据山东、山西等十一个省、区统计，去年11月份成年母猪比10月份的增加了14．7％。浙江、上海、福建、河南、广西等省、市、区提出的“见母就留，先留后选”的口号，是扩大母猪群的主要方法。他们发动群众把所有小母猪饲养成龄后配种生一胎小猪，然后看生下的小猪壮弱情况和产仔畜成活率高低，再决定母猪是否留下繁殖，逐渐选优去劣，达到良种化，这种普中选良，良普结合的办法，是完全符合我国当前的客观要求的。因为当前的问题是首先要在数量上满足饲养上的需要。见母就留，产仔一胎再选，会不会使劣种滥竽充数，影响后代质量呢？种好苗壮，母大儿肥。母猪生下一胎，就可从小猪看出是良种还是劣种。如果是不宜繁殖的劣种，只要把母猪和产下的小猪作为肉猪喂养，就不会使劣种传下去。另一方面，动物和植物品种的优劣都不是绝对的，任何良种总有一定缺点，任何劣种之所以能够流传到现在，也一定有某些优点；而且优劣之间，是会随着条件的改变互相转化的，特别是通过杂交和适当的饲育管理，可以使劣种变为良种。稗草原是与水稻同科的植物，水稻与它混生时，对水稻的生长有极大的破坏作用，因而人们见稗就拔。广东的杨明汉同志却用贵州的稗草和“信饭”种水稻杂交，繁育出“信饭贵稗”千粒穗良种，这就是最好的明证。因此，见母就留，先留后选是当前迅速扩大母猪群，迅速发展养猪生产中一项先进的办法，很多地区这样办了，全国各地都应当这样办。
    见母就留，先留后选，怎样才能又快又好地做到呢？今天本报发表的浙江黄岩县两个半月母猪增加两倍半的消息，提供了一项重要的经验，这就是领导干部、群众、技术员三结合的办法，逐栏逐头鉴定和选留母猪。经验证明，选留母猪也和其他任何工作一样，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，就能收到多快好省的效果。如果只靠少数兽医、阉割人员去鉴定选留，而不注意做好政治思想工作、不注意发动群众参加，是很难达到要求的。
    扩大母猪群，必须坚决贯彻执行自选自留自繁自养的方针，才能保证猪源充足、繁育良种、防止疫病，从而保证本单位养猪业发展规划的实现。现在，全国各地到处在大力发展养猪生产，靠少数地区供应小猪显然是远远不能满足客观要求了，解决猪源的根本办法，就是自繁自养。全国各地人民公社大办养猪场、贯彻执行以公养为主、公养私养并举的方针，就给自繁自养解决猪源办法创造了极为有利的条件。现在许多公社，生产队的养猪场都选留和饲养了大量母猪，或者建立了专门饲养种猪的种猪场，建立了母猪饲养基地，繁殖小猪。河南省商水县回墙人民公社张坡大队的万头养猪场一年内母猪增养了近一倍，全场七百多头母猪头头满怀，平均每窝产仔猪十只，全部成活，因而使肉猪饲养量就比上年同期增长了七倍多，同时还支援了兄弟社、队一批猪苗。自繁自养不仅从根本上解决了猪源问题，而且也便于繁殖和改良优良猪种，这个养猪场现有母猪中良种猪就占了80％以上。1960年可以全部实现良种化。事实证明，只有坚决地贯彻执行自繁自养方针，养猪事业的迅速发展才能有充分的保证。
    全国各地国营农场、人民公社都应当根据自己的发展养猪生产的规划，自选自育母猪，自繁自养小猪，彻底解决猪源问题，保证满足养猪事业发展的需要，同时逐步达到良种化。当然，由于各地条件不同，发展母猪有快有慢，社与社、队与队之间相互支援猪苗还是必要的，特别是在目前，饲养母猪繁殖小猪基础好的社、队，更应该发扬共产主义风格，从各方面支援帮助基础差的社、队解决猪源困难。但是最主要的，还是要求这些社、队，鼓足干劲，争取在一个较短时间内，做到自选自育自繁自养。
    前面说过，现在全国各地都注意选留母猪扩大母猪群了，但是也还有一些同志对多养母猪存在着某些顾虑和不正确的认识，他们认为“母猪养期长，成本高，要亏本，不合算”；“缺乏精饲料，母猪养不好”。其实，养母猪不仅不会亏本，而且对增加公社、生产队和社员的收入也是大有好处的。一头母猪从小饲养半年左右，配种怀孕，九个月左右生第一胎，就以一般一窝产十只小猪计算，养上一个月，共可卖得一百元左右。而在这十个多月内，母猪约需喂一百多斤精饲料，加上各种粗饲料，其价值约在十元左右，买小猪成本费也十元左右，生下的小猪喂养半月多每头饲料费需要两元左右，母猪和小猪的肥料大致可和饲养的人工折价相抵。这样，母猪从小养到产下第一窝小猪，如果全部出售，就可盈余六十元左右，这比同期养一头肉猪的收入只会多不会少。母猪如养得好，到第二年“小猪”再生小猪，约可产仔猪四、五十头，那盈余就更多了。浙江省浦江县下岩生产队养了几十头母猪后，一年产下小猪一千三百多只，除自养外，有一千一百多只出售支援外队，共收入一万零五百多元，除去成本，净余五千多元。由此可见，说养母猪不合算、要亏本，是没有根据的。
    缺少精饲料能不能养好母猪？这个问题很多公社早就以事实作了肯定的回答了。母猪是要比一般肉猪多喂一些精饲料的，但是仍然应以青粗饲料为主。农作物的茎、根、叶含有十分丰富的营养，青饲料中含有各种各样的维生素，有助于母猪的生长发育和提高繁殖能力，青饲料吃得多，生长发育就快，还可避免发生不受胎和流产等病症，只要做到粗料细喂，青料酵喂，合理搭配，青粗饲料的营养是不下于精饲料的。养猪有经验的群众说得好：粗饲料，切碎煮熟就是精饲料。俗语说：“三分料，七分喂”，就是这个道理。
    另一方面母猪怀孕后期和哺乳期间，需要适当搭配的精饲料，也并不一定要粮食、米糠，事实上现在搭配的精饲料是多种多样的，如豆渣、麸皮、玉米蕊，油菜秆等等都用作精饲料了。杭州市西湖公社南山生产队采取“母猪不怀吃大灶、怀孕吃中灶、哺乳吃小灶”的分期配料喂养办法，母猪和仔猪没有喂过一斤粮食，但养得母猪头头满怀，小猪只只健壮。因此，强调养母猪要亏本和缺精饲料难养好的一些同志，还需要进一步虚心学习先进经验，努力克服各种困难，这样才能够迅速扩大母猪群，赶上或者超过先进单位。
    扩大母猪群以后，就要大抓配种工作，提高成年母猪的满怀率，做到全配满怀，提高繁殖能力。在这方面，各地已出现了很多好的经验，如建立母猪卡片制，逐头登记配种情况，随时检查，同时采取药物催情，人工授精，和多次配、双重配、重复配、混合配等先进配种方法，使母猪头头配种，只只满怀，胎胎高产。
    扩大母猪群以后，如何相应地选留公猪，也是一个重要问题。现在很多地区正按照一比三十的比例，选留良种公猪，同时在目前公猪不足的情况下，大力采用人工授精等办法提高良种公猪的利用率，是很必要的。采用人工授精后，一头公猪可配种两三百头母猪，同时由于人工授精能正确掌握母猪发情期，进行适时配种，因此能提高母猪受胎率，此外，还可以减少猪病传染。有人说，人工授精是繁殖改良猪种最经济最有效和最迅速的办法，这是一点不假的。
    母猪配种以后，还要做好保胎工作。仔猪生下以后要精心护养。也就是说，做到全配全怀以后，还要做到全产、全活、全壮。在这方面，有许多优秀饲养员创造出好经验，广西石龙县妙皇公社路村大队养猪场的饲养员李秀珍，创造了一头母猪三年产九胎、平均每胎生十二只，个个成活，只只肥壮的经验，就是一个例子。河南、浙江等省都发现有母猪一胎产小猪三十八只，只只成活的高产纪录。这些事例说明，在饲养员们的鼓足干劲、精心培养下，达到母猪全配全怀全产全活全壮是完全可能的，我们应该十分重视各地的先进经验，及时介绍推广，力争所有的母猪都全配、多胎、高产。保证1960年养猪事业更加繁荣兴旺！
