(Reported by our newspaper) In the past half month, amid the high-speed development of the pig-raising industry in Shaanxi Province, a large number of Party and government leading cadres from counties, cities, and communes have gone to pig farms to work alongside pig farmers, learn pig-raising knowledge, and promote the high-speed development of the pig-raising industry.

In December 1959, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee issued instructions to the county and commune Party committees regarding "appointing one or two responsible comrades to go to pig farms and work as pig farmers for about a month." Subsequently, Party organizations at all levels convened meetings to formulate plans for responsible comrades to participate in pig-raising work. Some leading comrades in certain areas immediately packed their bags and set off. To date, according to incomplete statistics, a total of 660 people across the province, including county Party secretaries, county heads, commune Party secretaries, commune heads, management area and production team Party branch secretaries, have successively gone to pig farms to work as pig farmers.

Upon arriving at the various pig farms, these leading cadres immediately participated in labor, humbly learned experience from veteran pig farmers, and enriched their own pig-raising knowledge. Zhang Hongru, Secretary of the Huxian County Party Committee and County Head, upon arriving at the Dawang Commune livestock farm, happened to see workers chopping coarse fodder. He put down his luggage, took off his coat, and worked alongside the workers. The next morning, when he was sweeping pig manure with the workers, he noticed some workers observing the manure while sweeping. After inquiring, he learned that this was how to identify whether the pigs had any diseases. He immediately notified the county Party committee to promote this experience throughout the county. In the struggle to prevent and control pig epidemics, Liu Chonghua, First Secretary of the Lintong County Party Committee, went deep into the Xijia production team pig farm of the Xinfeng Commune. Together with veterinarians and pig farmers, he fed the pigs, observed and researched, and adopted measures such as isolation, pigpen disinfection, separate feeding, and feeding cooked food, preventing the spread of pig asthma, which veterinarians believed was impossible to control.

Cadres working as pig farmers have greatly promoted the enthusiasm of the masses for raising pigs, changed the incorrect views of some cadres and the masses towards pig-raising work, and fostered a new atmosphere of "glory in raising pigs." Lan Wenzhi, Deputy County Head of Qianxian County, after participating in pig-raising work at the pig farm of the Xiaozheng Village production team of the Linping Commune, the commune immediately launched a mass pig-raising upsurge, with even the old men in the nursing home collecting pig feed and raising pigs themselves. Xin Shujun, Deputy County Head of Zhouzhi County, after taking on pig-raising work at the Hexin production team of the Jinqu Commune, more than 50 cadres in the county quickly volunteered to take up pig-raising jobs.

(Reported by our newspaper) Chadian Commune in Tongren County, Guizhou, has established pig-raising "experimental plots" at all levels, which has effectively promoted the development of the pig-raising industry. In 1959, the total number of pigs raised in the commune reached 39,044, an increase of 1.9 times compared to 1958.

Chadian Commune's large-scale pig-raising "experimental plots" began in February 1959. In order to enable cadres to understand pig-raising knowledge and strengthen leadership over the pig-raising industry, the commune Party committee called on leading cadres at all levels to vigorously develop pig-raising "experimental plots," participate in pig raising, and lead pig raising. In a short period of time, the commune, management area, and production team levels established 33 pig-raising "command posts" and "command pens," raising a total of 15,000 pigs. Among them, there were "experimental plots" of the first secretary of the Party committee, as well as "experimental plots" combining cadres, commune members, and veterinarians. In the "experimental plots," a variety of experiments were conducted with a focus on fattening pigs, breeding piglets, and researching feed.

In order to ensure that the pig-raising "experimental plots" played a demonstrative role, leading cadres at all levels personally participated in feeding pigs and actively studied pig-raising techniques. Zhang Chunsheng, Deputy Secretary of the Party branch of the Chadian Management Area, since the establishment of the pig-raising "command post," often worked with pig farmers to study problems in pig raising, personally participated in feeding pigs, and explored the experience of separate pen and enclosure feeding by dedicated personnel to make thin pigs strong and healthy. He also actively studied veterinary techniques and learned the ability to treat more than a dozen pig diseases. The management area promoted the experience of the "experimental plots," and in 1959, no pigs died, and weak pigs were raised well.

Over the past year, Chadian Commune has fully leveraged the demonstrative role of the pig-raising "experimental plots." Whenever there was a creation or new experience in the pig-raising "experimental plots," the commune Party committee would hold on-site meetings to summarize and promote it. From the beginning of the "experimental plots" to the present, more than 30 on-site meetings have been held at the pig-raising "command posts" and "command pens," which has greatly promoted the pig-raising industry in the commune.

    陕西六百多名干部到猪场当饲养员
    参加养猪　领导养猪
    贵州茶店公社干部养猪“试验田”推动养猪工作
    本报讯　近半月来，陕西省在高速度发展养猪事业中，大批县、市、公社的党、政领导干部，纷纷到养猪场和饲养员一起劳动，学习养猪知识，推动了养猪事业的高速度发展。
    1959年12月，陕西省委向各县委和公社党委发出关于“指派一两位负责同志到养猪场去，当一个月左右的养猪饲养员”的指示。接着，各级党的组织连续召开会议，制定了负责同志参加养猪工作的规划。有些地区的领导同志，立即整装出发。到目前为止，据不完全统计，全省已有县委书记、县长、公社党委书记、社长、管理区、生产队的党总支书记等，共计六百六十人先后到养猪场当了饲养员。
    这些领导干部，到达各个养猪场后，立即参加劳动，虚心向老饲养员学习经验，丰富自己的养猪知识。鄠县县委书记兼县长张鸿儒同志，一到大王公社畜牧场，正碰上职工们铡粗饲料，他放下行李，脱去外衣，便和工人一道干起来。第二天早上，当他和工人一块扫猪粪时，发现有的工人边扫边观察猪粪，他向工人了解后，才知道是从猪粪上辨别猪有无疾病。他立即把这个经验通知县委在全县推广。临潼县委第一书记刘崇华同志在防治猪疫的斗争中，深入到新丰公社席家小队猪场，和兽医、饲养员等一块喂猪，一同观察研究，采取了隔离、猪圈消毒、分群喂养、喂熟食等办法，防止了兽医们认为没法防治的生猪气喘病的蔓延。
    干部当养猪饲养员，大大推动了群众养猪的积极性，改变了部分干部和群众对养猪工作不正确的看法，形成“养猪光荣”的新风气。乾县副县长蓝文治同志到临平公社小正村生产队饲养场参加养猪工作以后，这个公社立即掀起了群众性的养猪高潮，连敬老院里的老汉也收集猪饲料，动手养猪。盩厔县副县长辛述峻同志到金渠公社河新生产队担任养猪工作以后，全县很快就有五十多名干部自告奋勇地走上了养猪工作岗位。
    本报讯　贵州铜仁县茶店公社层层建立养猪“试验田”，有力地促进了养猪事业的发展。1959年全社养猪总数达三万九千零四十四头，比1958年增加一点九倍。
    茶店公社大办养猪“试验田”，是在1959年2月间开始的。为了使干部懂得养猪的知识，加强对养猪事业的领导，当时公社党委号召各级领导干部大搞养猪“试验田”，参加养猪，领导养猪。在短短的时间内，公社、管理区和生产队三级，就建立起三十三个养猪“指挥场”和“指挥圈”，共计养猪一万五千头。其中，有党委第一书记的“试验田”，也有干部、社员和兽医员三结合的“试验田”。在“试验田”中，有重点地作了喂养肥猪、繁殖仔猪、研究饲料等多种多样的试验。
    为了使养猪“试验田”起到示范作用，各级领导干部都亲自参加喂猪，积极钻研养猪方面的技术。茶店管理区党总支副书记张春生，自从建立养猪“指挥场”以后，经常同饲养员一块研究养猪中的问题，亲自参加喂猪，摸索到分栏分圈专人喂养、使瘦猪健壮成长的经验。他还积极钻研兽医技术，学会医治十多种猪病的本领。全管理区推广了“试验田”的经验，1959年做到了没死一头猪，并且把瘦弱猪养好了。
    一年来，茶店公社充分地发挥了养猪“试验田”的示范作用。养猪“试验田”中一有创造或新的经验，公社党委就召开现场会总结推广。从搞“试验田”起到现在，先后在养猪“指挥场”和“指挥圈”召开了三十多次现场会，对公社的养猪事业，起到了很大的推动作用。（附图片）
