Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 24th: Cuban newspapers "Revolución" and "Hoy" recently published editorials fiercely condemning the aggressive rants made by U.S. Representative Hosmer against Cuba and other countries in Latin America.

Under the pretext of preventing so-called "international communism," Hosmer arrogantly demanded that the U.S. government pass a resolution to interfere in the increasingly high-rising national democratic movements in Latin America according to the so-called "Monroe Doctrine," and to rebuild so-called "free governments" for the people of these countries.

"Revolución," in commenting on Hosmer's speech, said that for Hosmer, so-called communism is the uprising of the Panamanian people who want to see their flag planted in the Canal Zone. The newspaper pointed out that according to the same logic, the anti-American demonstrations that broke out in Venezuela and Peru during Nixon's visit to South America in 1958 were also "communism." Naturally, this cannot be missing: "Communism" is also the Cuban Revolution.

The editorial pointed out that, according to the imperialist mentality of the U.S. congressmen, the people of Latin America are inferior nations, and they can be invaded whenever the Washington masters have a whim. In order to impose another Somoza or Trujillo on the people of Latin America, Hosmer has dug up the Monroe Doctrine from the grave again, which the United States has used for decades to plunder the wealth of Latin America and trample on the national sovereignty of various countries.

The editorial then pointed out that the era in which the U.S. Marines could arbitrarily trample on Cuban territory is over. The postponement of the Quito Conference and the failure of the U.S. voting machine at the Pan-American Conference last year have proven this point. The editorial emphasized that the fate of Cuba is no longer determined in Washington. The Cuban people are no longer afraid of any demons. They will take the road of freedom, independence, and progress at all costs.

The Cuban newspaper "Hoy," in commenting on Hosmer's rant, pointed out that the so-called Monroe Doctrine announced by the United States in 1823—"America for Americans," has long been "interpreted by the imperialists as 'America for the Americans.'" Now Hosmer is using Hitler-style anti-communist pretexts to suggest the restoration of the Monroe Doctrine, the purpose of which is to "cover up the armed aggression against Cuba launched from abroad and the imperialist's new offensive against the patriotic movements in Latin American countries striving for national liberation and democracy."

The editorial pointed out that adventurers preparing to attack Cuba are concentrated in bases in Miami, Guatemala, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and other places. The rumor mongering trusts such as United Press International and Associated Press have launched fierce attacks on the Cuban Revolution and its revolutionary leaders, and the rumors from the U.S. Caribbean naval commander about "Russian submarines" being seen in the Caribbean Sea—all of this, coupled with Hosmer's suggestion, "shows that the danger facing Cuba is very real, and that despair may cause the enemies of the revolution to launch cruel adventurous actions."

The editorial pointed out, "However, Mr. Hosmer should know that the era in which the United States treated our country as a colony is over. Now Cuba's policies are made not in Washington but in Havana."

The editorial emphasized that now is the time for U.S. congressmen to know that Cuban affairs should be resolved by Cubans. It is also time for them to know that Panamanian affairs should be managed by Panamanians, and Venezuelan affairs should be managed by Venezuelans.

### 古巴人民不怕华盛顿的妖魔  古巴报纸谴责美国议员的侵略叫嚣

    古巴人民不怕华盛顿的妖魔
    古巴报纸谴责美国议员的侵略叫嚣
    新华社24日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴“革命报”和“今日报”不久以前先后发表社论，猛烈谴责美国众议员霍斯默针对古巴和拉丁美洲其他一些国家发出的侵略叫嚣。
    霍斯默在所谓防止“国际共产主义”的借口下，狂妄地要求美国政府通过决议，根据所谓“门罗主义”原则来干涉拉丁美洲日益高涨的民族民主运动，并且为这些国家的人民重建所谓“自由的政府”。
    “革命报”在评论霍斯默的讲话时说，对霍斯默来说，所谓共产主义就是巴拿马人民的起义，他们希望看到自己的国旗插在运河区。报纸指出，按照同样的逻辑，尼克松1958年访问南美时在委内瑞拉和秘鲁爆发的反美示威也是“共产主义”。自然，也不能缺了这一条：“共产主义”也就是古巴革命。
    社论指出，按照美国议员的帝国主义的心理状态，拉丁美洲人民是劣等的民族，当华盛顿老爷心血来潮时，就可以侵略他们。为了把一个索摩查或一个特鲁希略强加在拉丁美洲人民头上，霍斯默又从坟墓中挖出了门罗主义，美国在数十年间就是用这个主义来掠夺拉丁美洲的财富和践踏各国人民的民族主权。
    社论接着指出，美国海军陆战队可以任意践踏古巴领土的时代已经过去了。基多会议的延期召开，以及去年美国在泛美会议上投票机器的失灵都证明了这点。社论强调说，古巴的命运已经不决定于华盛顿。古巴人民已经不怕什么妖魔鬼怪了。他们将不惜一切代价走自由、独立进步的道路。
    古巴“今日报”在评论霍斯默的叫嚣时指出，美国在1823年宣布的所谓门罗主义——美洲是美洲人的美洲，早已经被“帝国主义者解释为美洲是美国人的美洲了”。现在霍斯默用希特勒式的反共借口建议恢复门罗主义，其目的是“掩盖从外国发动对古巴的武装侵略和帝国主义对拉丁美洲各国争取民族解放和民主的爱国运动的新攻势”。
    社论指出，准备进攻古巴的冒险家集中在迈阿密、危地马拉、尼加拉瓜、多米尼加和其他地方的基地。合众国际社和美联社等造谣托辣斯对古巴革命及命革领袖展开猛烈攻击，美国加勒比海海军司令关于在加勒比海有人看到“俄国的潜水艇”的谣言——所有这一切，加上霍斯默的建议，“都说明古巴面临的危险是千真万确的，说明绝望可能使革命的敌人发动残忍的冒险行动”。
    社论指出，“但是，霍斯默先生应该知道美国像对待殖民地那样对待我们国家的时代已经过去了。现在古巴的政策不是在华盛顿而是在哈瓦那制定的。”
    社论强调指出，现在是美国议员应该知道古巴的事情要由古巴人来解决的时候了。也是他们应该知道巴拿马的事情要由巴拿马人来管委内瑞拉的事情要由委内瑞拉人来管的时候了。
