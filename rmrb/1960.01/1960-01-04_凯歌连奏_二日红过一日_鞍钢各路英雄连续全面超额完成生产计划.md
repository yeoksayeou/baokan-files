Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 3rd: Heroes from all fronts at Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) are celebrating continuous triumphs. Following the complete victory on New Year's Day, they comprehensively overfulfilled the daily production plans for major products such as steel, pig iron, and steel materials on the second day of the joint technical performance competition week. On the 2nd, steel production exceeded the plan by 1,785 tons, pig iron by 38 tons, and steel materials by 1,299 tons.

In the booming upsurge of the joint technical performance competition, the broad masses of workers are vigorously carrying out technical innovations and constantly creating new production records. The workers of No. 9 blast furnace of the Iron Smelting Plant—a national red banner furnace—changed the original small tuyeres to large tuyeres from the 1st, increasing the hot air volume. In the past two days, they have produced 332 tons of pig iron more than planned, accounting for more than 66% of the total increase in pig iron production of the entire plant. The workers of No. 20 open hearth furnace of the Third Steelmaking Plant—a national red banner open hearth furnace—overfulfilled the plan on the 1st. On the 2nd, they shortened the charging time by half an hour in the technical performance, greatly shortening the overall steelmaking time, and continued to overfulfill the production plan, playing a significant role in ensuring the plant's increased steel production of more than 1,600 tons in the past two days.

Tens of thousands of advanced producers and model workers distributed in various factories and mines not only created outstanding achievements themselves in the battle to seize a flying start to production, but also enthusiastically passed on their advanced experience to others, helping other workers also create outstanding production achievements. Li Shaokui and Chen Xiaofa, nationally renowned model workers and fast steelmaking experts from the First Steelmaking Plant, created excellent results using fast steelmaking methods in the paired performance competition launched on the 1st. On the 2nd, they went to No. 9 open hearth furnace to demonstrate rapid furnace repair, helping the workers of No. 9 open hearth furnace shorten steelmaking time. Zhao Wenlin and others, advanced producers from Rolling Team C of the First Medium Plate Plant, in order to help the workers of Team B create high production records, ran to the rolling mill during their rest time to teach the workers of Team B their advanced rolling methods. As a result, the workers of Team B continuously created new production records.

Nearly 2,000 leading cadres above the section chief level in various factories and mines have continuously gone deep into the front lines since the 1st, solving key production problems together with the workers. After discovering advanced individuals and advanced experiences, they immediately disseminated and promoted them, enabling more workers to catch up with the advanced level, which played a significant role in ensuring a flying start to production.

At present, the Angang iron and steel army, which is winning one victory after another, is continuing to deepen the joint technical performance competition, striving to win a complete victory in this year's first joint technical performance competition week, and laying a good foundation for completing the production plans for January and the first quarter ahead of schedule.

    凯歌连奏　二日红过一日
    鞍钢各路英雄连续全面超额完成生产计划
    新华社鞍山3日电　鞍钢各路英雄连奏凯歌，继元旦全线大捷之后，在联合技术表演竞赛周的第二天，又全面超额地完成了钢、生铁、钢材等主要产品的日计划。2日，钢比计划超产一千七百八十五吨，生铁超产三十八吨，钢材超产一千二百九十九吨。
    在轰轰烈烈的联合技术表演竞赛热潮里，广大职工大搞技术革新，不断创生产新纪录。全国红旗高炉——炼铁厂九号高炉的职工们，从1日起将高炉原来的小风口改为大风口，增大了热风量，两天来共比计划增产生铁三百三十二吨，占全厂增产生铁总量的66％以上。全国红旗平炉——第三炼钢厂二十号平炉的工人们，1日超额完成了计划后，2日在技术表演中把装料时间缩短了半小时，使整个炼钢时间大为缩短，继续超额完成了生产计划，对保证全厂两天来增产一千六百多吨钢起了重大作用。
    分布在各厂矿的成千上万名先进生产者和劳动模范在夺取生产开门红的战斗中，不仅自己创造了出色的成就，还热情地把自己的先进经验传授给别人，帮助其他工人也创造出出色的生产成就。全国著名劳动模范、第一炼钢厂快速炼钢能手李绍奎和陈效法，在1日开展的对手表演赛中，曾经用快速炼钢方法创造了优异的成绩。2日，他们又到九号平炉表演快速补炉，帮助九号平炉的工人缩短炼钢时间。第一中板厂轧钢丙班的先进生产者赵文林等人，为了帮助乙班工人创造高产纪录，在休息时跑到轧钢机旁，向乙班工人传授自己先进的轧钢方法。结果，乙班工人连创生产新纪录。
    各厂矿近两千名科长以上的领导干部，1日以来连续深入现场，同工人一起解决生产关键问题，发现先进人物和先进经验后，立即加以传播、推广，使更多的工人赶上先进水平，对保证生产开门红起了很大作用。
    目前，连战连捷的鞍钢钢铁大军，正在继续深入开展联合技术表演竞赛，力争今年的第一个联合技术表演竞赛周获得全胜，为提前完成1月份和第一季度的生产计划打下良好的基础。
