Adhere to the Pace of the Great Leap Forward
Liu Zhenzong, First Secretary of the An'guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hebei Province

In 1959, the people of An'guo County overcame natural disasters and achieved an all-around bumper harvest of grain, cotton, and oil crops. Although more than 30,000 mu of land in the county suffered from varying degrees of flooding, and the sweet potato planting area was reduced by more than 200,000 mu compared with 1958, the total grain output still reached 381 million jin, with an average yield of 800 jin per mu. This was an increase of 19% and 35.3% respectively compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and surpassed the grain yield per mu target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule. The total cotton output was more than 19 million jin, with an average yield of 72 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 24.1% compared with 1958; the total oil crop output was more than 6.11 million jin, with an average yield of 350 jin per mu, an increase of 40% compared with 1958. The grain yield per mu in the Wu'renchao and Qizhou communes has exceeded 1,000 jin, with 100 production teams exceeding 1,000 jin of grain per mu, and 73 production teams exceeding 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Moreover, 1,000 mu of land in the Wu'renchao Commune created a record of 1,876 jin per mu for double-cropping grain.

With the development of production, the people's living standards have also improved accordingly, with an average income of more than 100 yuan per person, exceeding the living standards of the local well-to-do middle peasants.

The great leap forward in agricultural production in An'guo County proves the greatness and correctness of the Party's general line for building socialism, the greatness and correctness of the people's communes, the Great Leap Forward, and the mass movement, and the greatness and correctness of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture formulated by Chairman Mao. We have profound experiences of all this in 1959.

Vigorously Carry Out Mass Movements and Give Full Play to Subjective Initiative

As early as the winter of 1958, An'guo County launched a campaign to mobilize the masses to formulate a Great Leap Forward plan for grain production in 1959 to cross the Yangtze River. This plan was based on subjective strength and objective possibilities (existing production conditions and foundation), as well as the actual experience of 1958. Therefore, the plan's targets were both advanced and based on the masses. Of course, there were certain difficulties in achieving this leap forward target. For example, intensive cultivation required more labor; tools were backward, chemical fertilizers were lacking, and some people were still accustomed to backward farming techniques of the past, etc. But we were convinced that as long as we gave full play to subjective initiative and made full use of the favorable factors of objective conditions, these problems could be solved. When formulating the leap forward plan, the county party committee consistently guided the movement with the idea of grasping firmly, grasping tightly, grasping thoroughly, and grasping practically from beginning to end, seeing both the difficulties in the movement and analyzing the conditions for overcoming them. Countless facts have proven that as long as we muster our efforts, we can overcome unfavorable factors and achieve final victory despite poor conditions. For example, although the Chengwei Commune had a great leap forward in 1958, its grain yield per mu was still very low, and the masses were determined to change their backward situation. They drilled 90 wells with machinery in the absence of water conservancy facilities; they deeply plowed and meticulously prepared the land, realizing garden-like cultivation; they reformed tools to a great extent with hard work and clever work due to labor shortage; the masses invested and contributed materials due to financial difficulties; they sought advice from everywhere due to lack of experience. Finally, they overcame various difficulties, defeated water and insect pests, and achieved a bumper harvest of 703 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 100% compared with 1958.

Vigorously carrying out mass movements and giving full play to the strength of the masses is a guarantee for continuous leaps forward. The county party committee first mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of the mass movement in continuously launching production upsurges in 1958. During the critical period of agricultural production, the county launched eight mass-based production movement upsurges centered on garden-like cultivation. During the movement, the spirit of "the whole county supports a commune in difficulty, and the whole commune supports a team in difficulty" was conscientiously implemented. Over the year, a total of five major collaborations involving 800,000 people were organized, giving full play to the power of the large collective and overcoming various difficulties that were difficult for a single commune or team to overcome.

The most effective way to carry out mass movements is to organize labor emulation drives. Over the year, the county's eight people's communes formed three league areas, and 44 management areas and 304 production teams formed more than 200 league groups, forming a mass-based competition movement to strive for the upper reaches and strive for the first place. In addition, opponent competitions were also vigorously carried out, as well as competition movements to establish pacesetters and plant red flags.

Realize Advanced Garden-Like Cultivation

In 1959, 70% of the land in An'guo County realized advanced garden-like cultivation. The main signs are: the land has been deeply ploughed and improved; water conservancy and irrigation have been mechanized; 10,000 to 20,000 jin of base fertilizer have been applied per mu; the land has been leveled into squares connected to each other, realizing planting by region and planting according to local conditions; all improved varieties have been used; reasonable close planting has been implemented; and scientific management has been implemented to achieve no insects, no weeds, and no diseases.

The construction process of garden-like cultivation is also a process of scientific and technical training for the broad masses of farmers. Since the winter of 1958, we have carried out a nationwide technical dissemination campaign. Each team has a technical advisory group of "four combinations" of young people, adults, old people, and technicians. Communes and teams have scientific research organizations and weather outposts. Through study and research, on-site "consultations" and other methods, 50,000 agricultural technicians have been trained, and about 10,000 "native experts" in various crops have been cultivated, forming a strong agricultural technical force to ensure the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture.

Multiple Cropping and High-Yield Production

Multiple cropping is mainly to increase the multiple cropping index and expand the planting area to improve land utilization. The cultivated land area in An'guo County is 860,000 mu, and the multiple cropping index before 1958 was 1.24, which has been expanded to 1.37 this year. This not only increases the annual harvest, but also plays a role in promoting autumn production with summer production.

For high-yield production, we have carried out 110,000 mu of high-yield fields in 290,000 mu of wheat, and we have also carried out high-yield fields, command fields, and experimental fields in autumn crops, with a total area of more than 200,000 mu. The output of wheat high-yield fields accounts for 60% of the total output, and the output of 25% of the autumn grain crop high-yield fields reaches 40% of the total output.

Mobilize Various Forces to Support Agriculture

Mobilize all positive factors and fully support the Great Leap Forward in agriculture. Over the past year, the industrial front has produced a large number of irrigation machines, machine parts, and has taken on the task of repairing and assembling machinery for agricultural production. During the drought resistance campaign, all employees of the machinery factory were mobilized, contracted to communes and areas, and went to the fields to inspect and repair; the commercial sector climbed mountains and waded through rivers to purchase a large number of materials for agricultural production; whenever it was at a critical juncture in agricultural production, all schools invested in production through half-day systems and short-term holidays.

Grasp Production and Grasp Life

While grasping production, the county party committee also paid attention to grasping life. We believe that the more tense the production is, the more we must care about the people's lives, in order to better encourage the people's labor enthusiasm and make the production upsurges higher and higher. Each level of party committee has a secretary specifically in charge of life, and has established mass life service agencies. Taking running canteens well as the center, they actively run kindergartens and nurseries, and select people with good political conditions, skills, and enthusiasm for public welfare to serve as cooks and childcare workers. At collective labor sites, performing arts groups and film teams go to the construction sites. During each large-scale, long-term shock movement, cultural and recreational teams go to the construction sites to give consolation performances.

1960 has arrived, and the people of An'guo County will continue to achieve even better leaps forward. We will unswervingly hold high the red banner of the general line and the people's commune, and strive to achieve a grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu, a wheat yield of 500 jin per mu, a ginned cotton yield of 200 jin per mu, and a peanut yield of 500 jin per mu in 1960.

The Great Leap Forward movement has tempered the people of An'guo, and we are confidently entering the great year of 1960.

    坚持大跃进的步伐
    中共河北省安国县委员会第一书记　刘振宗
    1959年，安国县人民战胜自然灾害，取得了粮、棉、油料等全面丰收。全县有三万多亩土地虽然遭受了不同程度的水涝灾害，甘薯播种面积比1958年减少二十多万亩，但粮食总产量仍达三亿八千一百万斤，平均亩产八百斤，分别比大跃进的1958年增产19％和35．3％，提前八年跨过了全国农业发展纲要规定的粮食亩产指标；棉花总产量一千九百多万斤，平均亩产皮棉七十二斤，比1958年增产24．1％；油料总产量六百一十一万多斤，平均亩产三百五十斤，比1958年增产40％。伍仁桥、祁州两个公社粮食亩产已超过千斤，粮食亩产超过一千斤的生产队有一百个，亩产百斤皮棉的生产队有七十三个。而伍仁桥公社有千亩田还创造了双季粮食亩产一千八百七十六斤的纪录。
    生产发展了，人民生活也就相应地提高了，每人平均收入一百元以上，超过了当地富裕中农的生活水平。
    安国县农业生产的巨大跃进，证明了党的建设社会主义总路线的伟大和正确，证明了人民公社、大跃进、群众运动的伟大和正确，证明了毛主席制定的农业“八字宪法”的伟大和正确。这一切，我们在1959年都有深刻的体会。
    大搞群众运动  充分发挥主观能动作用
    安国县还在1958年冬季，就发动广大群众制定了1959年粮食产量指标过长江的跃进计划。这个计划是根据主观力量和客观可能性（现有的生产条件和基础），以及1958年的实际经验为基础制定的。因此，计划指标既先进，又落实于群众基础之上。当然，要实现这个跃进指标，也有一定的困难。例如要精耕细作，劳力感到不足；工具落后、缺少化学肥料，以及部分群众还习惯于过去落后的耕作技术等等。但是我们确信，只要充分发挥主观能动作用，充分利用客观条件的有利因素，是可以解决这些问题的。在制定跃进计划时，县委始终是以抓狠、抓紧、抓透、抓实一贯到底的思想指导了运动，既看到了运动中的困难，又分析了战胜困难的条件。无数事实证明，只要鼓足了干劲，尽管条件差，也能克服不利因素，取得最后胜利。如程委公社1958年虽然有了很大跃进，但粮食亩产量仍然很低，群众立志要改变落后面貌。他们在没有水利的条件下，打成了九十眼机井；大地高洼不平，他们深翻精整，实现了园田化；缺乏劳力，他们苦干加巧干，大搞工具改革；资金困难，群众投资献料；经验不足，到处投师取经。最后，他们终于克服了种种困难，战胜了水虫灾害，取得了粮食亩产七百零三斤的大丰收，比1958年增产一倍。
    大搞群众运动，充分发挥群众的力量，是不断跃进的保证。县委首先发动群众总结了1958年不断掀起生产高潮的群众运动经验，在农业生产关键时期，全县开展了八次群众性的以园田化为中心的生产运动高潮，运动中认真贯彻了“一社困难全县支援，一队困难全社支援”的精神。一年来共组织了五次共八十万人的大协作，充分发挥了大集体的力量，战胜了一社、一队难以克服的各种困难。
    大搞群众运动的最有效的办法，是组织劳动竞赛。一年来，全县八个人民公社结成了三个联赛区，四十四个管理区、三百零四个生产队组成二百多个联赛片，形成了群众性的争上游、争第一的竞赛运动。另外，还大搞对手赛，以及树标兵、插红旗的竞赛运动。
    实现高级园田化
    1959年，安国全县有70％的土地实现了高级园田化。主要标志是：土地经过深翻改良；实现了水利化和灌溉机械化，每亩施底肥一至二万斤，土地平整成方、方方相连，实现了按区域种植和因地制宜种植；全部使用良种；合理密植；达到无虫、无草、无病害，实行科学管理。
    园田化的建设过程，也就是对广大农民进行科学技术训练的过程。我们从1958年冬天就开展了全民性的技术大传授，队队有青、壮、老年人和技术员“四结合”的技术顾问团，社、队有科学研究组织和气象哨，通过学习研究、现场“会诊”等方法，训练了五万名农业技术员，培养了各种作物的“土专家”约一万人，形成了一支强大的农业技术大军，保证了农业“八字宪法”的全面贯彻执行。
    多种多收和高额丰产
    多种多收，主要办法是提高复种指数，扩大播种面积，以提高土地利用率。安国县耕地面积共有八十六万亩，1958年以前复种指数为一点二四倍，今年扩大到一点三七倍。这不仅增加全年收成，而且起到以夏促秋的作用。
    高额丰产，我们在二十九万亩小麦中，就搞了十一万亩高额丰产田，在大秋作物中又搞了丰产田、指挥田、试验田，总面积有二十多万亩。小麦丰产田的产量达总产量的60％，25％的大秋粮食作物丰产田的产量达到总产量的40％。
    调动各种力量支援农业
    调动一切积极因素，全力支援农业大跃进。工业战线一年来，为农业生产生产了大批灌溉机械、机器零件，并担任了机械的修配任务。在抗旱运动中，机械厂全体职工总动员，包社包片，到田间巡回检查修理；商业部门爬山涉水，为农业生产采购大量物资；每逢在农业生产的紧要关头，各学校都以半日制、短期放假等办法投入生产。
    抓生产也抓生活
    在抓生产的同时，县委同时注意抓生活。我们认为，越在生产紧张的时候，越要关心群众生活，才能更好地鼓舞群众的劳动热情，才能使生产高潮浪浪高。各级党委都有一名书记具体抓生活，并建立了群众生活办事机构，以办好食堂为中心，积极办好幼儿园、托儿所，并选拔了政治条件好、有技术而又热心于公共福利事业的人担任炊事员、保育员。集体劳动的场所，都有文工团、电影队上工地，在每次规模较大、时间较长的突击运动中，文娱队伍就到工地慰问演出。
    1960年来到了，安国县人民将继续实现更好的跃进。我们坚定不移地高举总路线，人民公社的红旗，力争在1960年粮食亩产达到一千斤，小麦亩产五百斤，棉花亩产皮棉二百斤，花生亩产五百斤。
    大跃进运动锻炼了安国人民，我们正满怀信心跨进伟大的1960年。
