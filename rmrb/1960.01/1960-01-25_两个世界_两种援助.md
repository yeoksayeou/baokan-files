Two Worlds, Two Kinds of Aid
Soviet Union, Skorov, Stepanov

Assisting underdeveloped countries is a relatively new phenomenon in international life. Not long ago, this issue practically didn't exist. This wasn't because the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America weren't experiencing poverty and suffering before, but because they were deprived of their rights and unable to voice their opinions. Furthermore, the only socialist country at the time didn't have sufficient economic potential to allocate a certain amount of funds to aid underdeveloped countries.

It was only world-historical events such as the emergence and vigorous development of the socialist world system, the disintegration of colonial empires, and the competition between socialism and capitalism worldwide that brought the issue of aiding backward countries to the forefront of world politics.

Countries that have freed themselves from colonial dependence are in a difficult situation. They inherited a backward, bleak, and unilaterally distorted socio-economic legacy from the colonial system. The average annual income of the people in these countries is only one-twentieth to one-fortieth of the per capita income of industrialized capitalist countries.

Underdeveloped countries have made great efforts to eliminate generations of backwardness. However, the economic disparity between them and industrialized capitalist countries has not only not narrowed, but has instead widened. Currently, 90.1% of industrial products in the capitalist world come from highly developed capitalist countries, while underdeveloped countries, accounting for two-thirds of the capitalist world's population, produce only 9.9% of industrial products.

However, this doesn't mean that underdeveloped countries are doomed. Politicians, economists, and broad segments of the population in these countries firmly believe that economic and cultural advancement is possible, and should primarily rely on the guarantee of domestic material resources. Therefore, most underdeveloped countries see the exploration and rational use of domestic accumulated funds as a primary task. However, it's also becoming increasingly clear that without significant social reforms: land reform, the adoption of progressive taxation, the establishment of a state-owned economy, and adjusting economic development based on national plans, the problem still cannot be solved. Because these measures touch upon the existing system of production relations, they naturally intensify class struggle and political conflict in underdeveloped countries.

This tense struggle within underdeveloped countries is taking place under the conditions of competition between the two world systems of socialism and imperialism. They are faced with the example of two hundred years of Western capitalist development. They can compare this example with the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, which has only been developing for a fifth of that time but has made an incomparably profound impression, and also with the experience of the various people's democratic countries.

In the future, aid to countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will only account for a small portion of their total expenditure on developing their economies and cultures. Foreign loans, grants, and technical assistance can never become the driving force for healthy economic development. Economic progress cannot be imported from abroad, but should only be drawn from within. The funds provided from abroad can either become a catalyst for development or an obstacle to it, depending on the attitude of the country providing the aid.

Recent experience clearly shows that there are two distinctly different attitudes towards the issue of aiding underdeveloped countries. Socialist countries believe that economic and technical cooperation with these countries should become a factor in accelerating development, consolidating their national independence, and strengthening the peace-loving forces of the world. Imperialist countries, on the other hand, use their "aid" to pursue new colonial policies, guarantee the interests of monopoly capital, and further divide the world politically into hostile blocs. In this case, it can rightly be said that the same aid is vastly different.

After losing direct control over their former colonies, imperialist countries have tried to control the newly liberated countries through military oppression and economic exploitation. The "Cold War" and international tension are the best allies of modern colonialists. The war hysteria and arms race atmosphere created by Western countries have been used to draw Asia, Africa, and Latin America into their military systems. Western countries have turned "aid" to underdeveloped countries into a major component of promoting neo-colonialism, a tool of the "Cold War."

From 1952 to 1958, direct military "aid" consistently accounted for 41% to 61% of the total U.S. "aid" to Asian and African countries. If we include "defense support" expenditures, which are unjustifiably listed as "non-military aid," military supplies account for three-quarters of all U.S. "aid" to these countries.

The political and military nature of U.S. "aid" to underdeveloped countries has been openly commented on in the American press on numerous occasions. Lippmann wrote: "What we call foreign aid is, in the final analysis, used year after year to support the system of military alliances established by Truman... Only occasionally, in order to create a good impression abroad, is essentially military aid portrayed as non-military aid." In February 1959, the current Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Fulbright, also admitted: "We provide the people of underdeveloped countries with weapons of great destructive power on a grand scale, but we rarely provide them with the tools to fight against their own abject poverty, economic difficulties, and endless suffering..."

Countless facts show that U.S. "aid" is a tool used to realize imperialist political and military strategies.

In 1956, the United States and Britain promised to provide Egypt with loans to build the Aswan High Dam. They believed that the "validity and moral basis" for this loan was that Egypt abandoned its neutral policy and agreed to Western control over its finances. The subsequent development and tragic ending of this policy of economic pressure is well known to everyone.

In early 1959, the United States proposed to the Republic of Iraq to conclude an economic agreement and held negotiations with it. However, after considering that the conditions put forward by the United States were unacceptable, the Kassem government finally rejected its demands.

In addition to the political and military aspects, the economic expansion characteristics that are one of the features of imperialism can also be easily seen in the "aid" from Western countries to underdeveloped countries.

Profit is the main driving force of the capitalist system, and it also determines the characteristics of international economic relations in the capitalist world economic system. The interests of monopoly capital have left their most powerful imprint on the "aid programs" for underdeveloped countries. Throughout the post-war period, U.S. diplomats and the authorities implementing "foreign aid programs" have made it one of their basic tasks to establish a "favorable climate" for foreign private investment in underdeveloped countries.

The so-called "favorable climate" for imperialist monopoly capital first and foremost refers to limiting the activities of democratic forces as much as possible in the former colonies and semi-colonies. Foreign capital sees the victory of democratic movements as a threat to its interests, such as the implementation of nationalization, restrictions on the remittance of profits abroad... Therefore, monopoly capital colludes with the most reactionary forces: feudal lords, warlords, and bureaucratic capital. This is the reason why the United States supports the most reactionary regimes in Asia and supports the military dictatorships in Pakistan and Thailand.

Another important condition that U.S. monopoly capital believes is necessary to establish a "favorable climate" is to limit the development of state-owned economies and impose the "free enterprise" system on underdeveloped countries as a standard that must be observed.

Such policies can of course only be interference in the internal affairs of other countries. In underdeveloped countries, where capital is generally lacking and dispersed, only the state has the power to raise funds for large-scale national economic development plans. Therefore, any restrictions on the state-owned economic sector will weaken these countries' ability to revitalize their economies and postpone the moment they achieve economic independence.

Currently, more and more people in underdeveloped countries advocate taking extensive planning measures in economic work and strengthening the state-owned economic sector. The socialist system clearly demonstrates the superiority of planned economy over the anarchy of private capitalism. It strengthens the position of those in underdeveloped countries who advocate expanding the state-owned economic sector and strengthening planning work.

This is a real threat to those who want to win over underdeveloped countries to the capitalist system. In order to cope with this threat, last year, the United States launched a campaign to strive for cooperation between the State Department and private capital. Under the leadership of the Foreign Trade Association of the U.S. Department of Commerce, representatives of major U.S. companies studied how the government could most effectively use the help of private enterprises to realize the tasks of U.S. foreign policy. Robert Murphy, one of the leaders of the State Department, said in summarizing this campaign that the State Department believes it is necessary to find new ways to stimulate the export of U.S. private capital.

So, is American investment really beneficial to underdeveloped countries?

In the thirteen years from 1946 to 1958 in the post-war period, the total amount of U.S. foreign private direct investment increased by 18.1 billion U.S. dollars. During the same period, U.S. monopoly capital earned 25.7 billion U.S. dollars from foreign investment. Thus, the net flow of funds back to the United States reached nearly 7.6 billion U.S. dollars. Since nearly half of U.S. private direct investment is concentrated in underdeveloped countries, it is not the U.S. that has given them the necessary development funds, but on the contrary, they have become a source of capital accumulation for the U.S.

Underdeveloped countries have found the truly necessary support for them in their cooperation with socialist countries.

The scale of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and underdeveloped countries currently amounts to billions of rubles.

The total amount of loans provided by the Soviet Union to India has reached 2.6 billion rubles. Relying on these funds, India has established steel plants, heavy machinery manufacturing plants, mining enterprises, oil refining and pharmaceutical industries, huge thermal power stations, optical glass factories, and has carried out oil drilling and other work.

Soviet loans have also played a major role in the industrialization plan of the Egyptian region of the United Arab Republic. The machinery and equipment and raw materials provided by the Soviet Union through these loans are mainly used to develop the mining, petroleum, metallurgical, machine manufacturing, electrical machinery, chemical, pharmaceutical, and textile industries in the Egyptian region.

The Soviet Union has also signed and implemented economic agreements with many other countries in Asia and Africa. These countries are Iraq, Afghanistan, Ceylon, Indonesia, Ethiopia, and Libya. In addition, the Soviet Union has also provided Yemen, Nepal, and Cambodia with aid and technical assistance.

With the help of Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and the People's Republic of China, a large number of enterprises have also been established in underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa, including oil refineries, cement plants, machine manufacturing factories, power stations, water conservancy projects, textile factories, paper mills, plywood factories, etc.

In this way, the most important way for socialist countries to provide economic assistance to underdeveloped countries is to provide targeted loans for the construction of huge enterprises and projects that are of key significance to the national economy in these countries. The broad masses of the national independent countries of Asia and Africa regard industrialization as one of the most powerful levers for developing their economies and consolidating their political independence. The assistance provided by socialist countries fully meets this national task.

Under the pressure of the economic achievements of socialist countries and their increasing aid to Asian and African countries, Western countries have begun to re-examine their policies towards underdeveloped countries. At the recent meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund at the end of September 1959, the United States formally proposed the establishment of an "International Development Association." This association is planned to provide credit to underdeveloped countries for a period of twenty to forty years. The annual interest rate on loans will be 2% to 2.5%. The borrower can repay part of the loan in its own currency.

It is not difficult to see that this will become a model for new conditions for the United States to provide financial assistance. The leaders of the Western world understand that if they still pursue the previous open imperialist line, without considering that cooperation between underdeveloped countries and socialist countries is far more beneficial than cooperation with capitalist countries, then they will lose all credibility in the eyes of the governments of the various national independent countries. But for them, this is only a "competition cost" that they are forced to pay to deal with socialist countries, which is contradictory to the tasks and purposes of imperialist exploitation in nature.

The planned changes in the U.S. "aid" to underdeveloped countries have not yet been put into practice. But the very fact that the United States has launched a large-scale campaign to re-examine its policies in this area, and that it is trying to adapt "U.S. aid" to the trends and spirit of our times, shows the profound impact that socialist countries have had on the entire system of world economic relations.

    两个世界　两种援助
    苏联　斯科罗夫　斯捷潘诺夫
    援助经济不发达国家是国际生活中一项比较新的事物。不久以前，实际上还不存在这个问题。当然，这并不是因为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的人民以前不在经受贫困和痛苦，而是他们的权利被剥夺，不能发表意见。此外，当时唯一的社会主义国家还没有足够的经济潜力来拨出一定数量的资金援助不发达国家。
    只是这样一些世界性的历史事件，像社会主义世界体系的出现和蓬勃发展、殖民帝国的瓦解、社会主义和资本主义在全世界的竞赛，才把援助落后国家的问题提到世界政治的日程上来。
    摆脱了殖民地从属地位的国家，处境是很困难的。它们从殖民制度接受了一份落后的、惨淡的、单方面畸形发展的社会经济遗产。这些国家的人民每年的平均收入，仅为资本主义工业国家按人口计算的收入的二十分之一到四十分之一。
    为了消除世世代代的落后状态，不发达国家曾作了很大的努力。但是，它们同资本主义工业国家的经济悬殊，不仅没有缩减，而且相反在扩大。目前资本主义世界90．1％的工业品来自高度发展的资本主义国家，占资本主义世界人口三分之二的不发达国家仅生产9．9％的工业品。
    不过，不能据此就说不发达国家是命运注定的。这些国家的政治家、经济学者和广大阶层人民都坚信，经济和文化的提高是能够办到的，并且首先应当依靠国内的物质资源的保证。因此大多数不发达国家都把发掘和合理使用国内积累资金的问题看作是首要任务。但是，同时也越来越明显地看出，如果没有重大的社会改革：土改、累进税的采用、国营经济的建立、依据国家计划调整经济发展等，问题还是不能解决。由于这些措施触及现存的生产关系制度，它们就自然会使不发达国家的阶级斗争和政治冲突加剧起来。
    不发达国家内部这一紧张的斗争，是在社会主义和帝国主义这两个世界体系之间互相竞争的条件下进行的。在它们面前摆着已有两百年的西方发展资本主义的例子。它们可以拿这个例子来同发展时间只有五分之一、但却给人以无可比拟深刻印象的苏联社会主义建设经验相比，也可以同各人民民主国家的经验相比。
    将来对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的援助，将只占它们发展经济和文化总开支的一小部分。外国的贷款、赠予和技术帮助决不能成为经济健康发展的推动力。经济的进步不能从国外输入，而只应当从国内吸取。国外提供的资金既可成为发展的触媒剂，也可成为它的障碍物，这要看给予援助的国家的态度而定。
    近年的经验明显表明，在援助不发达国家的问题上，有两种截然不同的态度。社会主义国家认为，同这些国家进行的经济和技术合作，应当成为加速发展、巩固它们的民族独立和团结世界爱好和平力量的一个因素。帝国主义国家则利用它们的“援助”推行新的殖民政策，保证垄断资本利益并在政治上把世界进一步分裂为敌对的集团。在这种情况下，完全可以有权利说，同样是援助却大不相同。
    帝国主义国家在丧失掉对以前殖民地的直接统治以后，就力图用军事压迫和经济榨取来控制获得自由的国家。“冷战”和国际紧张局势是现代殖民主义者的最好盟友。西方国家制造的战争歇斯底里和扩张军备气氛，已被利用来把亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲拉入它们的军事体系。西方国家把对不发达国家的“援助”变成了推行新殖民主义的一个主要组成部分，一种“冷战”的工具。
    从1952年到1958年美国对亚、非国家的整个“援助”中，直接军事“援助”部分一直占41％到61％。如果把毫无道理地列入“非军事援助”的“防御支持”费也计算在内，那么军事供应就要占美国对这些国家全部“援助”的四分之三。
    美国对不发达国家“援助”的政治和军事性质已屡次受到美国报纸的公开评述。李普曼曾写道：“被我们称之为对外援助的东西，归根到底是年复一年地用来支持由杜鲁门所建立的军事联盟体系……只是偶而为了在国外制造良好印象，实质上是军事性的援助才被描绘成是非军事性的援助”。1959年2月现任参院外交委员会主席富布赖特也承认说：“我们以宏大的规模向落后国家人民提供破坏力很大的武器，但我们却很少为他们提供向自己的赤贫、经济困难和无尽头的困苦作斗争的工具……”
    无数的事实表明，美国的“援助”是用来实现帝国主义政治和军事战略的一种工具。
    1956年美国和英国答应给埃及以建筑阿斯旺高水坝的贷款。他们认为这笔贷款的“有效性和道义根据”是：埃及放弃中立政策并同意西方国家控制它的财政。这一在经济上施用压力的政策后来的发展和它的悲剧性结局已为大家所熟知。
    1959年初，美国向伊拉克共和国建议缔结经济协定，并同它举行了谈判。但是卡塞姆政府在考虑美国提出的条件不能接受以后，终于拒绝了它的强求。
    除了带有政治和军事性质的一面以外，从西方国家对不发达国家的“援助”中也很容易看出作为帝国主义特征之一的经济扩张特点。
    利润是资本主义制度的主要推动力，它也决定着资本主义世界经济体系中国际经济关系的特点。垄断资本的利益在对不发达国家的“援助计划”上打上了它的最有力的烙印。整个战后时期，美国外交人员和“援外计划”执行当局都把在不发达国家为外国私人投资建立“有利气候”作为他们的基本任务之一。
    帝国主义垄断资本的所谓“有利气候”首先是指在以前的殖民地和半殖民地国家尽量限制民主力量的活动。外国资本从民主运动的胜利中看到了实行国有化、限制利润汇往国外……为自己带来的威胁。因此垄断资本就竭力和最反动的势力：封建主、军阀、官僚资本相勾结。这就是美国支持亚洲最反动的政权、支持巴基斯坦和泰国的军事独裁的原因。
    美国垄断资本认为建立“有利气候”的另外一个最重要的条件是限制国营经济的发展，把“自由企业”制度作为一项必须遵守的标准，强加在不发达国家身上。
    这类政策当然只能是干预他国内政而不是其他。在不发达国家一般缺乏资本和资本分散的情况下，只有国家才有力量为大规模发展国民经济计划筹措资金。因此对国营经济部门的任何限制都会削弱这些国家在复兴经济方面的能力，推迟它们获得经济独立的时刻。
    目前不发达国家内主张在经济工作中广泛采取计划措施并加强国营经济部门的人越来越多。社会主义制度明显地显示了计划经济对私人资本主义无政府状态的优越性。它加强了不发达国家中主张扩大国营经济部门和加强计划工作的人的地位。
    这是对想争取不发达国家的资本主义制度的一项真正威胁。为了应付这一威胁，去年，美国掀起了一个争取国务院和私人资本合作的运动。在美国商务部对外贸易协会领导下，美国大企业的代表曾研究了政府怎样最有效地借私人企业之助来实现美国对外政策的任务。国务院的领导人之一罗伯特·墨菲在对这个运动作总结时说，国务院认为必须寻找新的办法来刺激美国私人资本输出。
    那么美国的投资对不发达国家真是有好处吗？
    在战后1946年到1958年的十三年中，美国对外私人直接投资的总额增加了一百八十一亿美元。同时期内，美国垄断资本从国外投资中赚得了二百五十七亿美元。这样，净流回美国的资金就达近七十六亿美元。由于美国私人直接投资近一半集中在不发达国家，因此就不是美国给了它们必要的发展资金，而是相反，它们倒成了美国积累资金的一个源泉。
    不发达国家在同社会主义国家的合作中，找到了对它们的真正必要的支持。
    苏联同不发达国家经济合作的规模目前已达数十亿卢布之多。
    苏联为印度提供的贷款总额已达二十六亿卢布。依靠这笔资金，印度建立了钢铁厂、重型机器制造厂、采矿企业、石油提炼和制药工业，巨大的热电站、光学玻璃工厂，并进行了石油钻探和其他工作。
    在阿拉伯联合共和国埃及地区实现工业化计划中，苏联的贷款也起了重大作用。通过这些贷款由苏联提供的机器装备和原料主要是用来发展埃及地区的采矿、石油、冶金、机器制造、电气机械、化学、制药和纺织工业。
    苏联还和亚、非其他许多国家签订和实行了经济协定。这些国家是伊拉克、阿富汗、锡兰、印度尼西亚、埃塞俄比亚和利比亚。另外，苏联还给了也门、尼泊尔和柬埔寨以援助和技术帮助。
    在捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和中华人民共和国的帮助下，在亚洲和非洲的不发达国家中也建立了大量的企业，其中有石油提炼厂、水泥厂、机器制造工厂、发电站、水利工程、纺织工厂、造纸厂、胶合板工厂等。
    这样，社会主义国家给不发达国家经济援助的最主要的方式就是提供有目的性的贷款以便用来在这些国家中建设巨大的、对国民经济有关键性意义的企业工程。亚、非民族独立国家广大阶层人民都把工业化看作是发展他们经济的一个最有力的杠杆和巩固他们的政治独立的一个手段。社会主义国家提供的援助完全符合这一民族任务。
    在社会主义国家的经济成就和它们对亚非国家的援助日益扩大的压力下，西方国家开始重新审查它们对不发达国家的政策。在1959年9月末最近一届世界银行和国际货币基金组织会上，美国曾正式提出了建立“国际开发协会”的建议。拟议由这个协会为不发达国家提供为期二十年到四十年的信贷。贷款年利将为2％到2．5％。贷款部分可由借款国用本国货币偿还。
    不难看出，这将成为美国提供财政援助的新条件的典范。西方世界的领导者们明白，如果他们仍执行以前公开的帝国主义路线，而不考虑不发达国家同社会主义国家合作远比同资本主义国家合作更为有利，那么它们在各民族独立国家的政府眼中就要失掉全部信誉。但是对于它们说来，这仅是被迫付出的一项对付社会主义国家的“竞赛费用”，从性质上来说是同帝国主义剥削的任务和目的相矛盾的。
    美国计划中的对不发达国家“援助”的变动目前还没有见诸实行。但是美国展开一个重新审查这方面政策的大规模运动，以及它竭力使“美援”适应我们时代的潮流和精神这件事本身，就表明了社会主义国家对世界经济关系的整个体系所发生的深刻印象。
