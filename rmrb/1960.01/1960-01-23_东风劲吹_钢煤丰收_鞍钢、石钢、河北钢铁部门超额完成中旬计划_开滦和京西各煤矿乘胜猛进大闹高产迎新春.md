Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 21st: By 24:00 on the 19th, Anshan Iron and Steel had already overfulfilled its steel ingot and steel product production plans for the first two ten-day periods of January by 5,200 tons and 2,400 tons respectively, ahead of schedule. The production level of both products was higher than in December last year, breaking the historical "convention" of low production at the beginning of the year.

	The various steelmaking and rolling mills of Anshan Iron and Steel made full preparations ideologically, materially, and organizationally at the end of last year to achieve a good start this year. In the early and middle ten-day periods of January this year, they also continuously carried out technical performance weeks. The workers on each open hearth furnace in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant held a rapid steelmaking competition, shortening the smelting time of each furnace of steel by more than 20 minutes.

Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company reported double victories in steel production in the middle ten-day period: steel production exceeded the ten-day plan by 10.02%, with a qualification rate of 99.37%, and pig iron production exceeded the ten-day plan by 3.21%, with a qualification rate of 99.52%.

	Each production unit grasped the production analysis work for each day, each shift, and each furnace. The workers of the converter steelmaking experimental plant not only promoted advanced experiences such as carbon ramming furnace lining and high carbon pulling operations, which increased production, but also organized advanced technical performances in demolding and oiling casting work, greatly reducing defects such as shrinkage cavities, slag inclusions, and scabs in steel ingots, and improving quality. After carrying out mass technical analysis activities, the ironmaking plant achieved high output and high quality, and the average daily output of pig iron in the middle ten-day period was even higher than in the early ten-day period.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 22nd: Steel and coal production in Hebei Province continued to rise. The average daily output of steel ingots in the province in the middle ten-day period of January increased by 0.67% compared with the early ten-day period, of which the daily output of steel ingots in the four steel plants in Tianjin increased by 11.02%. The average daily output of raw coal increased by 1.32% compared with the last ten days of December last year. The consumption indicators of raw and auxiliary materials for various products gradually decreased, and the product quality improved to some extent. The average qualification rate of steel ingots in the province reached 98.3%, an increase of 0.14% compared with the early ten-day period.

Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, January 21st: After completing the production plan for the first ten days of January one day ahead of schedule, the Kailuan Coal Mine workers also overfulfilled the production plan for the middle ten-day period by 8.25% by the 20th, and the ash content of raw coal met the national requirements. Compared with the level of the middle ten-day period of January with the fourth quarter of last year, the average daily output of raw coal increased by 2.44%, and the consumption of pit wood per thousand tons decreased by 7%.

	Now, the workers of Kailuan Coal Mine are summarizing and promoting effective experiences in production and solving the new imbalance between coal mining, tunneling, transportation, and hoisting.

Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: The Jingxi Mining Bureau overfulfilled its production plan in the early and middle ten-day periods of January, and the production level increased by 52% compared with the same period last year.

    东风劲吹　钢煤丰收
    鞍钢、石钢、河北钢铁部门超额完成中旬计划
    开滦和京西各煤矿乘胜猛进大闹高产迎新春
    据新华社鞍山21日电　到19日二十四点，鞍钢已经分别超额五千二百吨和二千四百吨提前完成了1月头两旬的钢锭和钢材生产计划。两种产品的生产水平都高于去年12月份，打破了历史上年初低产的“常规”。
    鞍钢各炼钢厂和轧钢厂，去年年底就从思想、物质和组织上为今年实现开门红作了充分准备。今年1月上、中旬，又连续开展了技术表演周。第一炼钢厂各个平炉上的职工，举行了快速炼钢竞赛，使每炉钢的冶炼时间缩短了二十多分钟。
    据新华社21日讯　石景山钢铁公司中旬的钢铁生产双双报捷：钢产量超过旬计划10．02％，合格率达到99．37％，生铁产量超过旬计划3．21％，合格率达到99．52％。
    各生产单位抓紧每天每班和每炉的生产分析工作。转炉炼钢试验厂职工不仅推广炭捣炉缸、高拉炭操作等先进经验，提高了产量，而且组织脱模、刷油等浇铸工作的先进技术表演，大大减少钢锭缩孔、压渣、结疤等缺陷，提高了质量。炼铁厂开展群众性的技术分析活动后，作到了高产优质，中旬生铁平均日产量比上旬又有提高。
    据新华社天津22日电　河北省钢、煤生产继续上升。全省1月中旬的钢锭平均日产量比上旬提高0．67％，其中天津市四个钢厂的钢锭日产量提高11．02％。原煤平均日产量比去年12月下旬提高1．32％。各种产品的原料材料消耗指标逐渐下降，产品质量有所提高，全省钢锭合格率平均达到98．3％，比上旬提高0．14％。
    据新华社唐山21日电　开滦煤矿职工在提前一天完成1月上旬的生产计划之后，到20日又超额8．25％完成了中旬的生产计划，原煤灰分合乎国家要求。以1月中旬的水平同去年第四季度比较，原煤平均日产量提高2．44％，每千吨坑木消耗降低7％。
    现在，开滦煤矿的职工正在总结和推广生产上行之有效的经验，解决采煤、掘进、运输提升之间的新的不平衡现象。
    据新华社21日讯　京西矿务局1月上、中旬超额完成生产计划，生产水平比去年同期提高52％。
