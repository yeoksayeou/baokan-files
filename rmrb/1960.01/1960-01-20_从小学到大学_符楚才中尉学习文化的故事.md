From Elementary School to University
	--The Story of Lieutenant Fu Chucai's Cultural Studies
	By our staff reporter Jiang Wenpin

Lieutenant Fu Chucai of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, utilizing his spare time to study culture while on duty, has completed junior high school algebra, physics, chemistry, and plane geometry; senior high school algebra, trigonometry, physics, chemistry, plane geometry, and solid geometry in three years; and has now completed the curve equation part of "Analytic Geometry" and the limit part of "Differential Calculus" in the university curriculum. After testing, the courses he self-studied are basically consolidated. This son of workers and peasants, who originally only had an elementary school education, has become a university student after three years of hard self-study.

Lieutenant Fu Chucai is thirty-three years old this year. He loved reading since he was a child. However, due to his poor family, his parents barely managed to support him until he graduated from higher elementary school, and he was forced to drop out of school and became a worker at a young age. In November 1948, he joined the People's Liberation Army. In the revolutionary ranks, due to his low level of education, he encountered many difficulties in his work. In 1955, when he was the deputy technical company commander of a tank regiment, he prepared for two full days to explain the principles of tank movement, but he still stammered during the explanation, sweating profusely. Some comrades applied for first-class drivers or driving technicians, and the subject content was very deep. When they asked him for tutoring, he felt powerless and anxious. He deeply felt that the development of the times and the development of the army were really swift and rapid, changing rapidly. "The situation is pressing, and we must study!" He thought: For the needs of the revolutionary work, whatever algebra or geometry, even if I am covered in teeth, I will touch you, poke you, and possess you!

This strong man, since he made up his mind to study culture, has never interrupted his studies in more than a thousand days and nights in the past three years, whether he was busy with work or on Sundays and holidays. He always works with such enthusiasm and studies diligently, becoming a cadre who balances work and study, excelling in both.

Three years is only a short period in a person's life. To advance from higher elementary school to university level in mathematics by self-study during spare time in tense work cannot but be said to be a huge leap forward. However, victory will not be delivered automatically. Lieutenant Fu Chucai overcame many difficulties in his studies with tenacious perseverance.

In the past three years, in solving the problem of time, because his work was very busy, he first ensured that his daily work and study were meticulously arranged; he tried his best to complete today's work today and squeeze out time to study more. Generally, he can strive to study for three hours every day: one hour at noon and two hours in the evening; and two or three hours on Sundays. Someone calculated for him that he squeezed out about three thousand and two hundred hours of study in three years. The formation of his study habits was obtained through continuous, even inch-by-inch, striving and exercise. He used to love playing poker. He spent most of his time playing poker during rest time or holidays. Later, his poker addiction was completely replaced by the interest in learning. In 1956, he took thirteen days of vacation and used it all for self-study. He finished studying "Plane Geometry" in high school last year by using his vacation time. Attending meetings, listening to reports, watching operas, and watching movies often take a lot of time because of waiting for people. Some people have found this rule and carry a deck of poker cards, but he carries a textbook he is studying. As soon as he sits in the auditorium, all his energy is immediately invested in the book. The degree of his hard work in study is almost to the point of forgetting to sleep and eat. The year before last spring, he was the only one left at home. He had to take care of the work of the entire department and also served as a math teacher at the night school. After he finished teaching his comrades at night, it was already ten o'clock. When he returned home, he squeezed out two hours from his sleeping time to study culture. Later, the leadership, seeing his eyes red, took the initiative to reduce his part-time teaching duties, and he was slightly relieved. Last April and May, he was transferred to the training team to study Chairman Mao's military works. He served as the squad leader and study group leader, and had to study and attend meetings, so time was really tight. However, he also squeezed out time here to review "Lishi High School Chemistry" and read "Logic" roughly!

Lieutenant Fu Chucai's perseverance in learning is even more prominent in his diligent research. In studying high school and university courses, because the troops lived in mountain villages, he could not find anyone to tutor him on the difficult points of some courses. He relied entirely on his own independent thinking and self-made insights. Whether the understanding is correct or not, only after the individual level has improved can he look back and review his homework to distinguish right from wrong. This difficult situation can be found in his homework. Looking at his notes for "Calculus" that he is studying, there are many blanks separated by three or four lines. What is the reason for this? He said, this is called surpassing "obstacles". In his studies, when he encounters a difficult point that has only individual significance and is difficult to understand for a while, he jumps over it and solves it after his level has improved. Now, the blanks in his homework books for high school courses have all been filled in. However, he never swallowed or easily let go of those difficult problems that have universal significance and must be understood on the spot. One night, in order to understand a formula, he repeatedly hypothesized various situations and used various solutions. Four or five sheets of sixteen-open smooth paper, written in pencil and pen, written on the front and written on the back, all the paper was densely written, and the problem was not understood. He was very tired and had to go to bed. However, his body was lying down, but his brain was not "sleeping" and was still thinking. Finally, he thought of a new solution, got up again to calculate, and found supporting materials in the algebra dictionary. Finally, he solved the knot. Although it was already two o'clock in the morning, his spirit was exceptionally pleasant!

Now, Lieutenant Fu Chucai has initially tasted the sweet fruit of cultural learning. Cultural learning has promoted his work, and the improvement of work efficiency has increased his time for cultural learning. His mood is getting more and more cheerful, and the road is getting wider and wider. Among the vast number of cadres in the People's Liberation Army who are marching towards cultural science, he has become one of the many pacesetters walking in the front.

    从小学到大学
    ——符楚才中尉学习文化的故事
    本报记者　姜文品
    人民解放军某部符楚才中尉，在工作岗位上利用业余时间学文化，三年来学完了初中代数、物理、化学、平面几何；高中代数、三角、物理、化学、平面几何、立体几何；现时又进修完了大学课程的“解析几何”的曲线方程部分和“微分学”的极限部分。经过测验，他自修过的课程基本巩固。这个原来只有高小程度的工农子弟，经过三年刻苦自修，现今已经成了大学生了。
    符楚才中尉今年三十三岁。他从小就极爱读书。但是，由于家境贫寒，父母使断腰骨供他念到高小毕业就被迫失学，很小就当了工人。1948年11月，他参加了人民解放军。在革命队伍里，由于文化水平低，工作上碰到不少困难。1955年，他在任坦克团技术副连长时，讲坦克运动原理，足足准备两天，讲时还是支吾不清，急得满头大汗。有的同志报考一级驾驶员或驾驶技师，科目内容很深，请他辅导，他力不从心，口结心苦。他深深感到：时代的发展，部队的发展，真是风驰电掣，一日千里，“形势逼人，非学不可！”他想：为了革命工作的需要，什么代数呀，几何呀，你就是浑身是牙，我也要去碰你、戳你、占有你！
    这位刚强的人，从立志学习文化以来，三年间，在一千多个日夜，不论工作忙闲或是星期天、假日，从未间断过学习，总是那么一股劲儿，热情地工作，奋发地学习，成了工学兼顾，两者双优的干部。
    三年的时间，在一个人的一生中只不过是短暂的一段。在紧张的工作中利用空隙时间自修数学，由高小跃升到大学水平，这不能不说是一个巨大的跃进。但是，胜利不会自动送上门来。符楚才中尉在学习中以顽强的毅力，克服了许多困难。
    近三年来，在解决时间问题上，由于工作十分繁忙，他首先做到了每日的工作、学习都有周密安排；今日工作尽量今日毕，挤出时间多学习。一般他每天能争取学习三小时：中午一小时，晚间两小时；星期天能学习两、三小时。有人给他计算了一下，三年中他大约挤出了三千二百个学习小时。他的学习习惯的养成，是在不断地、甚至是寸步不让地争取和锻炼出来的。他以前很爱打扑克，休息时间或假日，他大部分时间都花在打扑克上了。后来他的扑克瘾全部被学习兴趣代替了。1956年他休假十三天，全部作了自修。高中的“平面几何”就是去年他利用休假时间学完的。开大会、听报告、看戏、看电影，往往因等人占去很多时间，有的人摸得这条规律是带着一付扑克，他是装着一本正在进修的课本。到礼堂一坐，全部精力立时就投在书本上。他学习中那种刻苦用功的程度，几乎到了忘寝废食的程度了。前年春天，家里只剩下他一个人。他要照顾全处的工作，还兼着夜校的数学教员。晚间他忙着给同志们上完课已经十点了，他回家又向睡觉的时间里挤出两个钟头学习文化。后来，领导见他两眼挂着红丝，主动给减去兼职教员的职务，他才稍微松快了一下。去年4、5月份他又被调去集训队学习毛主席军事著作，他担任班长和学习组长，又要学习又要开会，时间真够紧了。可是，他在这里也挤出了时间，复习完了“礼氏高中化学”和粗读了“逻辑学！”
    符楚才中尉的学习毅力，更突出的表现在刻苦钻研方面。他在进修高中、大学课程中，因部队住在山村，有些课程的难点找不到人辅导，全靠自己去独立思考，自作见解。理解的对否，只有个人水平提高了以后，回头再来审阅自己的作业，才能辨别是非。这种艰难的情景，从他的作业中可以找到痕迹。拿过他正在进修“微积分”的作业笔记一看，里面隔三跳四，留有不少空白。这是什么原因呢？他说，这叫超越“障碍”。他在学习中，逢到只有个别意义、一时又难弄通的难点，就跳越过去，待水平提高后，再来解决。现在，他进修高中课程的作业本里面的空白，都填补一新了。然而，他对于那些具有普遍意义、非当场弄通不可的难题，却从不囫囵吞枣、轻易放过。一个晚上，他为了解一道算式，翻来复去假设了各种各样情况，使用了各种各样的解法。四五张十六开的光连纸，铅笔写了钢笔写，正面写了反面写，从黄昏一直到深夜，所有的纸都写得密密麻麻，问题还没弄通，身体很疲劳，迫不得已才睡下。然而，他身体躺下了，脑子却没“睡”，仍在思考。终于又想到新的解法，重新爬起来演算，并在代数词典上找到了旁证材料，最后解开了这个疙瘩。这时虽然已下两点了，但他的精神却异常愉快！
    现在，符楚才中尉，已初步尝到了文化学习的甜果。文化学习促进了他的工作，工作效率提高又增进了他文化学习的时间。他的心情越来越畅快，道路愈走愈广阔。他在向文化科学进军的解放军广大干部中，成了走在前面的许多标兵之一。
