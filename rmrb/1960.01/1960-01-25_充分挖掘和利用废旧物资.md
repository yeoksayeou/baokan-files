Fully Excavate and Utilize Waste Materials
People's Daily Commentator

The Spring Festival is just around the corner. According to traditional custom, the broad masses of residents, factories, enterprises, institutions, and organizations carry out a mass sanitation campaign a few days before the festival and thoroughly clean up the old, used, and damaged items accumulated over the year to celebrate the Spring Festival cleanly. This is a great opportunity to excavate and purchase "waste products." Therefore, strengthening the intensive purchase of waste materials around the Spring Festival has become an urgent task with a time limit for the commercial sector.

In recent years, the role of "waste product" purchasing in supporting industrial production and meeting market needs has been very significant, and more and more people have changed their view of underestimating "waste products." However, some people still do not sufficiently appreciate the significance of "waste product" purchasing. The "waste products" purchased by the state (including some stagnant materials), except for a small portion (such as old machines, household furniture, etc.) that can be used after processing, sorting, and repairing, are mostly raw materials necessary for industrial and handicraft production. According to statistics, from 1952 to September 1959, commercial departments across the country purchased a total of 14 million tons of various "waste products" and stagnant materials, including a large amount of important industrial raw materials such as mixed copper, waste steel, waste rubber, and waste paper, and rags. The Shanghai "waste product" purchasing department alone purchased waste steel in the first quarter of last year, which could be used to manufacture 5,000 tractors; the rags and waste paper purchased could be used to make paper to print 250 million newspapers. It is not difficult to understand that "waste products" are a component of the country's raw material sources. This is not only the case in the past and present, but it can be said with certainty that even when my country's industrial production has developed further in a few years, "waste products" will still be an important source of raw materials for my country. Actively doing a good job in "waste product" recycling is an important aspect of commerce serving production and commerce supporting production.

However, the potential of waste materials is not very clear to some people. For example, a few people think that "waste products" can only be collected less and less and cannot be collected more and more. This view is incorrect. Are "waste products" being collected less and less? This is a very practical question. Here, we can use the investigation of the annual purchase of "waste products" in Haicheng County, Liaoning Province, to illustrate. The total amount of "waste product" purchases in this county in 1954 was more than 150,000 yuan; in 1955 it increased to more than 210,000 yuan; in 1956 it increased to more than 300,000 yuan; in 1957 it increased to more than 440,000 yuan; and in 1958 it increased even more, and the total purchase amount reached more than 1.2 million yuan; the purchase amount increased year by year, and the purchase varieties also increased year by year. The situation in Haicheng County is like this, and the same is true in other regions. It can be seen that the saying that "waste products" are being collected less and less is groundless. We say that "waste products" are not being collected less and less, but have great potential to be tapped. The objective basis is that my country's production is developing very rapidly; the various means of production and means of livelihood provided by the state are increasing year by year at a large proportion. The material and cultural life of the broad masses of people is also constantly improving. In this way, the role of material "metabolism" will not only not weaken, but will become more vigorous. Taking some daily life matters as an example, in terms of clothing, the purchasing power of the broad masses of people has increased. With the addition of new clothes and new shoes, many old, unusable ones have to be replaced; in the past, not many people drank beverages, but now beer and soda have also become things that people consume in large quantities, and the number of waste empty bottles scattered among the masses is not decreasing, but increasing; for example, after the people's communes have brought about a universal upsurge in cultural learning in the vast rural areas, the paper they need has increased unprecedentedly, so the waste paper is not being collected less and less, but more and more. Many such examples can be cited. Don't these many facts sufficiently illustrate that the view that "waste products" are being collected less and less is groundless? It can be seen that the current problem is not the problem of "waste products" being collected less and less, but how to exert full effort and try every means to tap the potential of "waste products."

Of course, some things, such as old copper and tin utensils scattered among residents, will relatively decrease in the amount purchased year by year with the elimination of superstition. But this is only a small part of "waste products." On the other hand, there are still many "waste products" that have not been utilized for a long time that have not been excavated. For example, the number of cigarette butts left over from people smoking every day is difficult to count; who paid attention to it in the past? Most of them were thrown away. In fact, these cigarette butts, after simple processing, are a very effective pesticide. Recently, Beijing and other cities have launched the business of collecting cigarette butts on behalf of others in the process of tapping the potential of "waste products," which has been welcomed by the broad masses of people and has supported agricultural production. This is just one example. People's economic life is very complex and diverse, so the sources of "waste products" are also very rich in terms of variety. As long as the purchasing staff use their brains, go deep into and familiarize themselves with the lives of the masses, and strive for the cooperation of the masses, they will definitely find many new ways in "waste product" recycling.

Some people think that the potential of "waste products" is indeed great, but mainly in consumer goods. There are not so many in factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and organizations. This view is also inconsistent with reality. Facts have proved that in these production units and institutions and organizations, the potential of waste materials is also very great. According to a survey, the Tianjin commercial department, in cooperation with relevant units, cleaned up seven units including Tianjin Steel Rolling Plant, Bicycle Factory, Chemical Factory, Hengyuan Yarn Factory, Tianjin University, Nankai University, and the Municipal Finance Bureau in four days in October last year, and recovered a total of 5,220 tons and 400,000 pieces of "waste products" and stagnant materials. The Beijing commercial department purchased "waste products" worth 160,000 yuan from the Universal Machinery Factory at one time. On the basis of gaining experience from seven units, the city launched a blitz purchase campaign. From the beginning of December last year to January 20 this year, it cleaned up more than 170,000 tons of waste and stagnant materials, worth 90 million yuan. The "waste products" and stagnant materials cleaned up from these units are urgently needed raw materials for other units. There are tens of thousands of enterprises, institutions, and organizations like Beijing and Tianjin across the country. Some people may feel strange about the existence of "waste products" in production units, but this is not strange. The "waste products" referred to here are of course not finished products. Because with the rapid increase in production, the continuous updating of production equipment, and the continuous increase in product holdings, many scraps, old machines, and stagnant materials will naturally be produced. Therefore, in our country, "waste products" are being collected more and more, which is a normal and good phenomenon, which is a reflection of the rapid development of our country's production and the improvement of people's living standards. In the past, commercial departments have achieved certain results in carrying out "waste product" recycling business in this area, and it must be greatly strengthened in the future.

Commercial departments have also explored some laws and experiences in the "waste product" purchasing work. For example, vigorously conducting blitz purchases of "waste products" in conjunction with mass sanitation campaigns every year and festival is a successful experience. But this is far from enough, and it is also necessary to vigorously develop regular purchasing business. "Waste products" are produced regularly, anytime and anywhere. Carrying out regular purchasing business can improve the enthusiasm of the masses to sell "waste products." By closely combining blitz purchases and regular purchasing business, we can create greater and better achievements on the "waste product" purchasing front. In order to implement the policy of combining blitz purchases and regular purchases, commercial departments must also regularly study and improve purchasing methods. Many regional commercial departments have organized residents to set up "waste product" consignment points and stations, organized factory-to-factory hookups, on-site distribution of goods, and held "waste product" exhibitions, which are all good methods and have greatly promoted recycling work. It is hoped that all regions will promote them according to local conditions.

Vigorously tapping the potential of "waste products" not only has important economic significance, but it is also an important part of implementing the principles of building the country through diligence and thrift, managing households through diligence and thrift, and carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and therefore also has great political significance. 1960 is a year of continued leap forward in my country's national economy. Fully excavating and utilizing waste materials and supplementing more "supplies" for the continuous leap forward in industrial and handicraft production is even more important. This is a very glorious task for the commercial sector. We believe that under the leadership of party committees at all levels, the broad masses of commercial workers will continue to exert full effort and strive for the upstream, and this year's "waste product" recycling work will definitely achieve more outstanding results than last year.

    充分挖掘和利用废旧物资
    本报评论员
    转眼就要过春节了。按照传统的习惯，广大居民群众、工厂、企业、机关和团体在节日前几天都要开展一次群众性的卫生运动，并且把一年来废旧残破的物品进行彻底的清理，干干净净地欢度春节。这正是挖掘和收购“废品”的大好时机。因此，在春节前后，加强废旧物资的突击收购工作，就成为商业部门一件具有时间性的迫切的任务。
    几年来，“废品”收购工作对于支持工业生产、满足市场需要所起的作用是十分显著的，越来越多的人改变了轻视“废品”的看法。但是，对“废品”收购的意义，还有一些人没有足够的估计。国家收购的“废品”（包括一部分呆滞物资），除一小部分（如残旧的机器、日用家具等）经过加工整理和修配，就可使用外，绝大部分都是工业和手工业生产所必需的原材料。据统计，从1952年到1959年9月份，全国各地商业部门收购的各种“废品”和呆滞物资，累计起来已经达到一千四百万吨之多，其中包括大量的杂铜、废钢铁、废橡胶、废纸、破布等重要的工业原料。上海市“废品”收购部门仅在去年第一季度当中收购的废钢铁，就可用来制造五千台拖拉机；收购的破布、废纸造出的纸张可印二亿五千万份报纸。这就不难明白，“废品”，这是国家原材料来源的一个组成部分。它不但过去和现在如此，可以肯定地说，就是再过若干年，我国工业生产有了更大发展的时候，“废品”也仍然是我国原材料的一个重要来源。积极做好“废品”回收工作，是商业为生产服务、商业支持生产的一个重要方面。
    但是，废旧物资的潜力究竟有多大，在一些人中间还不是很清楚的。例如有少数人认为，“废品”只能越收越少而不可能越收越多。这种看法是不正确的。“废品”是不是越收越少呢？这是个很实际的问题。这里可以用辽宁省海城县历年收购“废品”的调查加以说明。这个县1954年的“废品”收购总额是十五万多元；1955年增至二十一万多元；1956年增至三十万多元；1957年增至四十四万多元；而1958年增长更多，收购总额竟达到一百二十多万元；收购金额是逐年增长的，收购品种也是逐年增长的。海城县的情况如此，其它地区也是一样。可见“废品”越收越少的说法是毫无根据的。我们说“废品”不是越收越少而是大有潜力可挖。客观依据是：我国生产的发展是十分迅速的；国家提供的各种生产资料和生活资料都是在逐年以很大的比例增长着。广大人民的物质文化生活也是不断地提高的。这样，物质的“新陈代谢”的作用不但不会减弱，而是更加旺盛了。就拿一些日常生活的事情来看，在穿着方面，广大人民的购买力提高了，随着添置新衣、新鞋，许多破旧的、不能再穿再用的就要替换下来；过去喝饮料的人不多，现在啤酒、汽水也成了人们大量消费的东西，散落在群众手中的废旧空瓶子就不是越来越少而是越来越多；再如，人民公社化以后给广大农村带来了一个普遍学文化的高潮，他们需要的纸张空前地增长了，因而废旧的纸张也不是越收越少，而是越收越多。像这样的例子还可以举出很多。这许多事实不是足以说明“废品”越收越少的看法是毫无根据的么？可见当前的问题不是“废品”越收越少的问题，而是怎样鼓足干劲，千方百计地挖掘“废品”潜力的问题。
    当然，有些东西，如散落在居民手中的旧铜、锡器皿，随着迷信的破除，收购量是要逐年相对地减少的。但这只是“废品”当中很少的一部分。另一方面还有许多过去长时期没有被利用的“废品”没有被挖掘出来。例如，每天每时人们吸烟剩下的烟头，数量是难以统计的；过去谁去注意过它呢？绝大部分都丢掉了。其实，这些纸烟头经过简单的加工就是一种效力很好的农药。最近北京市和其它一些城市在挖掘“废品”潜力中开展了代收纸烟头的业务，既受到广大群众的欢迎，又支援了农业生产。这只不过是一个例子。人们的经济生活是十分复杂、多样的，因而“废品”的来源从品种上看也是十分丰富的。只要收购人员开动脑筋，深入和熟悉群众生活，争取群众的合作，就一定会在“废品”回收方面找出许多新的门路来。
    有人认为，“废品”的潜力的确很大，但主要是在消费品方面。厂矿、企业、机关、团体就没有那么多了。这种看法也是不符合实际的。事实证明，在这些生产单位和机关、团体中，废旧物资的潜力也是很大的。据调查，天津市商业部门在有关单位的配合下，在去年10月份的四天当中清理了天津轧钢一厂、自行车厂、化工厂、恒源纱厂、天津大学、南开大学、市财政局等七个单位，共收回“废品”和呆滞物资五千二百二十吨零四十万件，北京市商业部门在通用机械厂一次收购“废品”总值就达十六万元。在取得七个单位经验的基础上，全市开展了突击收购运动，从去年12月上旬到今年1月20日止，共清理出废旧呆滞物资十七万余吨，价值九千万元。而从这些单位清理出来的“废品”和呆滞物资，都是其它单位所急需的原材料。像北京、天津这样的企业、机关、团体，全国成千上万。有人也许对生产单位存在着“废品”感到奇怪，其实这是没有什么奇怪的。这里所指的“废品”当然不是指生产的成品。因为随着生产的迅速提高，生产设备的不断更新，产品保有量的不断增加，就很自然地要产生许多下脚料、残旧的机器和呆滞物资。因此，在我们国家，“废品”越收越多，这是一个正常的、好的现象，这是我国生产迅速发展、人民生活水平提高的反映。过去商业部门在这方面开展“废品”回收业务是取得了一定的成绩的，今后还必须大大加强。
    商业部门在“废品”收购工作中也摸索出一些规律和经验。例如每逢过年过节结合群众性的卫生运动大力突击收购“废品”，就是一条成功的经验。但这还很不够，还必须大力开展经常性的收购业务。“废品”是经常地、随时随地产生的，开展经常性的收购业务，就能提高群众出售“废品”的积极性。把突击性收购和经常性收购业务密切结合起来，我们就能在“废品”收购战线上创造出更大更好的成绩来。商业部门为要贯彻突击性收购和经常性收购相结合的方针，还必须经常研究和改进收购方法。不少地区商业部门组织居民设立“废品”代购点、站，组织厂厂挂钩、现场分货、开“废品”展览会，都是很好的办法，都大大推动了回收工作。希望各地因地制宜地加以推广。
    大力挖掘“废品”潜力，不仅具有重要的经济意义，它同时也是贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭持家、开展增产节约运动的一个重要内容，因而也具有重大的政治意义。1960年是我国国民经济继续跃进的一年，充分挖掘和利用废旧物资，为工业和手工业生产连续跃进补充更多的“粮草”，就显得更加重要了。这是商业部门一项十分光荣的任务。我们相信，广大商业职工在各级党委领导下，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，今年的“废品”回收工作一定会取得比去年更为出色的成绩。
