Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The 1960 Spring Festival is approaching, and railway and transportation departments have recently made arrangements and deployments for passenger and freight transportation during the Spring Festival.

According to analyses by the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Transportation, the passenger and freight transportation tasks before and after this year's Spring Festival will be busier than in any previous year. It is necessary to ensure the transportation of raw materials needed for factory and mining enterprises to achieve a good start, daily success, and sustained success; and to ensure the transportation of holiday supplies and passengers who need to return home during the Spring Festival. Based on this situation, all units under the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Transportation have begun to rush the transportation of coal, steel, cement, other essential production materials, and various holiday supplies in advance, and are vigorously organizing more loading and more transportation to free up more capacity for busy passenger transport in the coming weeks.

Regarding passenger transportation during this year's Spring Festival, railway and transportation departments require all regions to adopt methods of queuing and planned transportation by industry, that is, to arrange the order of priority for employees, students, residents, etc., who need to return home, in coordination with relevant units and railway and transportation departments, to arrange travel dates and transport them in stages. This will orderly stagger the time for passengers to return home, avoiding the phenomenon of excessive concentration of passengers in the few days before the festival. Currently, railway and transportation departments are actively preparing for Spring Festival passenger transportation. The Ministry of Railways has long begun to investigate the flow of Spring Festival passengers in major cities, large-scale water conservancy construction sites, factories and mines, universities, and major railway lines this year, and will add temporary passenger trains during the Spring Festival. The vehicles and ships of the units under the Ministry of Transportation will undergo a pre-festival overhaul. Regions with insufficient automobile transport capacity will be unified arranged by the local Party committee to transfer some automobiles from agencies, enterprises, schools, and troops to support Spring Festival transportation; or select some better freight vehicles and add cold-proof, safety, and seating equipment to convert them into temporary passenger vehicles. On routes from Shanghai to northern Jiangsu and Ningbo, the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau and the Shanghai Maritime Bureau will increase a number of passenger-cargo ships to participate in Spring Festival passenger transport. Certain capacity has also been allocated on key coastal and Yangtze River routes.

The Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Transportation have also decided to promote communist collaboration on a large scale and promote the experience of "one-stop" transportation during this year's Spring Festival transportation period. Various regions will organize railway, waterway, and highway intermodal transport, connecting vehicles and ships as much as possible to reduce the time passengers spend transferring vehicles and ships midway.

In order to do a good job in passenger and freight transportation during the Spring Festival, railway and transportation departments have further strengthened transportation organization and service work. The Ministry of Railways instructed railway bureaus in various regions to organize two teams of personnel during the Spring Festival to direct on-site continuously; in areas with heavy loading and unloading tasks, they are required to organize sufficient loading and unloading teams under the leadership of the local Party committee to achieve quick loading and unloading. The Ministry of Transportation's river and sea transportation departments decided to launch a service competition movement of "safety, punctuality, speed, convenience, and treating guests like relatives" during the Spring Festival transportation period; the highway transportation department decided to carry out double-shift transportation, with vehicles not stopping while people rest, on the premise of ensuring safety. In stations, docks, and areas for transferring vehicles and ships, commercial departments will set up additional snack stalls and supply points to meet the needs of long-distance passengers.

    保证生产物资、节日物资和旅客的运输
    春节客货运输早作安排
    铁道交通部门加强组织和服务工作
    新华社12日讯　1960年的春节快到，铁路、交通部门最近已经就春节期间的客货运输工作，作了安排和部署。
    据铁道部和交通部分析，今年春节前后的客货运输任务，将比过去任何一年都更加繁忙。既要保证运输厂矿企业生产所必需的原料材料，实现开门红、日日红、红到底；又要保证运输节日物资和春节期间需要回家的旅客。根据这一情况，铁道部和交通部所属各单位，都已经提前开始赶运煤炭、钢铁、水泥和其他生产必需物资以及各种节日物资，并且大力组织多装多运，以便为下旬繁忙的客运腾出更多的运力。
    对于今年春节期间的旅客运输，铁路、交通部门要求各地采取按行业归口排队和计划运输的办法，就是把需要回家的职工、学生、居民等，分别前后次序，由各有关单位和铁路、交通部门共同安排乘车日期，分期运送。这样就可以有秩序地错开旅客回家的时间，避免发生节前几天旅客过分集中的现象。目前，铁路、交通部门正在积极进行春节旅客运输的准备工作。铁道部早已着手调查今年各大城市、大型水利工地、厂矿、大专学校以及各铁路干线上的春节旅客流向，春节期间将增开临时客运列车。交通部所属各单位的车船，将在春节前提前检修一次。汽车运力不足的地区，将由当地党委统一安排，从机关、企业、学校、部队调用一部分汽车，支援春节运输；或者选择一部分较好的运货汽车，增加防寒、安全、坐椅等设备，改装成临时客车使用。上海到苏北、宁波的航线，将由长江航运局和上海海运局增调一批客货轮，参加春节客运。沿海和长江沿线的重点航线上，也都配备了一定的运力。
    铁道部和交通部还决定在今年春节运输期间，大搞共产主义协作，推广“一条龙”运输的经验。各地将组织铁路、水路、公路的联运，尽可能地把车船衔接起来，减少旅客中途换转车船的时间。
    为了做好春节期间的客货运输，铁路、交通部门都进一步加强了运输组织工作和服务工作。铁道部指示各地铁路局，春节期间组织成两套人马，在现场不间断地指挥；装卸任务繁重的地区，要求在当地党委的领导下，组织足够的装卸队伍，做到快装快卸。交通部江海运输部门，决定在春节运输期间，开展一个“安全、正点、迅速、便利、待客如亲人”的服务竞赛运动；公路运输部门决定在确保安全的条件下，开展双班运输，歇人不歇车。在车站、码头和转换车船的地区，商业部门将增设一些零食摊、供应点，以满足长途旅客们的需要。
