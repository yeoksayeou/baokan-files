    Human Pride
    Lin Ling
    The great news from the Pacific Ocean has filled us with boundless excitement and elation at the start of the New Year.
    The successful launch of a multi-stage ballistic rocket into the Pacific Ocean by the Soviet Union represents another giant step forward for humanity on its historical path, and raises "human pride" to unprecedented heights. As the "People's Daily" editorial of January 22nd pointed out: "As the 1960s have just begun, the Soviet Union has once again scaled new heights in the most cutting-edge science and technology. This is a great event! It heralds that socialist countries will continue to achieve new and greater successes in the 1960s; the beautiful prospect of mankind realizing interstellar travel is already in sight!" How can this not arouse the pride of everyone on Earth, how can it not arouse the unceasing cheers of peace-loving people on every continent!
    The Soviet Union's testing of new rockets, preparing to launch heavy satellites and cosmic flights to planets in the solar system, is another unprecedentedly great test of mankind breaking out of the planet it inhabits and rushing into the vast and boundless universe.
    It was the Soviet Union that first launched artificial Earth satellites and allowed the crystallization of human labor and wisdom to enter space. This is in accordance with the laws of development: the latest stage of human social development—socialism—first achieved victory in the Soviet Union; since socialism transcended the boundaries of one country in the 1940s and formed the socialist world system, the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, has been advancing more rapidly along the path of human development, forging ahead like a locomotive of history.
    However, while peace-loving people around the world are cheering, there is a small group of people who are worried, weeping, cursing, and clamoring. In this universal celebration, they see the shadow of their own destruction.
    This is also a phenomenon that is completely in accordance with the laws of development: the greater the progress made by progressive mankind, the more pitiful the dregs of humanity appear. When progressive mankind not only begins to build a beautiful and happy garden on the Earth it has inhabited for hundreds of thousands of years, but also extends its wisdom to other planets in the solar system, a small group of scum are doing everything possible to maintain and consolidate their bloody rule of exploitation, oppression, and extortion, making this group of scum appear even more humble, insignificant, and shameful.
    Progressive humanity, headed by socialist countries, and the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, are leaping forward. Those who are advancing are already so powerful that they have brought about new changes in the entire international situation. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, the current era is an era in which "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind," an era in which "the enemy rots away day by day, while we get better day by day."
    Whoever is the most progressive is the most powerful; whoever is the most progressive is the greatest. The re-launch of the cosmic rocket can prove this point.
    Conversely, the imperialists who are clinging to bases scattered everywhere and are still trembling with fear, and who continue to expand their armaments and prepare for war behind the mask of peace, are the most insignificant, the most humble, and the most backward. The reaction to the successful launch of this powerful cosmic rocket can prove this point.
    Looking out at the Pacific Ocean, looking out at the powerful Soviet Union that launched this intercontinental rocket, we feel deeply proud and happy. And when we see the dead end of imperialism, we cheer even more enthusiastically for the realization of space flight.

    人类的骄傲
    林陵
    从太平洋上传来了新春的大喜讯，引起我们无比的兴奋和激动。
    苏联向太平洋发射多级弹道火箭的成功，使整个人类在历史的道路上又迈进了一大步，使“人的骄傲”达到了空前未有的高度。正如1月22日“人民日报”社论指出的：“二十世纪的六十年代刚开始，苏联在最尖端科学技术方面又攀登上了新的高峰。这是一件大喜事！它预示着社会主义国家在六十年代里将不断获得新的更大成就；人类实现星际旅行的美丽前景已经在望！”这怎能不引起地球上每一个人的自豪，怎能不引起各大洲爱和平的人们的不停止的欢呼声！
    苏联试验新火箭，准备发射重型卫星和向太阳系行星的宇宙飞行，这是人类越出自己所居住的星球而冲入广大无垠的宇宙空间的又一次空前伟大的试验。
    首先放射人造地球卫星而使人类的劳动与智慧的结晶进入太空的是苏联。这是合乎发展规律的事情：人类社会发展的最新阶段——社会主义首先是在苏联取得胜利；自从社会主义在四十年代越出一国范围而形成社会主义世界体系以来，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营就更加迅速地循着人类发展的大道，以历史火车头的姿态向前突飞猛进了。
    但是在全世界爱好和平的人民欢声雷动的时候，另外有一小撮人在发愁、饮泣、咒骂、叫嚣。他们在这普天同庆的欢声中，看到了自己毁灭的影子。
    这也是完全合乎发展规律的现象：进步的人类愈是取得巨大的进展，就使人类的渣滓愈加显得可怜相。当进步的人类不仅在自己住了几十万年的地球上开始建设美丽幸福的大花园，而且把自己的智慧扩展到太阳系其他星球的时候，一小撮败类却在想尽种种办法维持和巩固自己的剥削、压迫、敲诈的血腥统治，使这批败类显得更加卑微、渺小和可耻。
    以社会主义各国为首的进步人类，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营在飞跃地前进着。前进着的人已经强大到如此程度，它使整个国际形势产生了新的变化。正如毛泽东同志所指出的，当前的时代是“东风压倒西风”的时代，是“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”的时代。
    谁最进步，谁就最有力量；谁最进步，谁就最伟大。宇宙火箭的再度上天，正可以说明这一点。
    反之，死抓着满布四处的基地仍然在吓得发抖的，在和平的面具后继续扩军备战的帝国主义者，则是最渺小、最卑微和最落后。从这次强大宇宙火箭发射成功的反应来看，正可以证明这一点。
    遥望太平洋，遥望发射这支洲际火箭的强大的苏联，我们深深地感到自豪，感到高兴。而当我们看到帝国主义的穷途末路的时候，我们便更加热烈地欢呼宇宙飞行的实现了。
