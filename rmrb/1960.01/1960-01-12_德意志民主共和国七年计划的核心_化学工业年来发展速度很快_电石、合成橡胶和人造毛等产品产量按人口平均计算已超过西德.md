Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 11th. The chemical industry of the German Democratic Republic, the core of the Seven-Year Plan for developing the national economy, achieved significant successes in 1959. In that year, the chemical industry overfulfilled the annual production plan by 10%, and significant progress was made in large-scale capital construction.

The chemical industry is increasingly providing raw materials and fuels to industry, agriculture, and transportation, playing an increasingly important role in the national economy.

Like many industrial sectors, the chemical industry of the German Democratic Republic also developed at a faster pace last year. The output of important chemical products such as calcium carbide, synthetic rubber, and artificial wool has already exceeded that of West Germany on a per capita basis. The country's largest chemical plant, the Leuna Chemical Plant, which produces 370 kinds of products annually, completed last year's production plan twelve days ahead of schedule, increasing the country's output by products worth 26 million marks. Products such as nitrogen fertilizer and phosphate fertilizer also overfulfilled the annual plan, providing more chemical fertilizers for this year's agricultural production.

In 1959, the scale of capital construction projects in the chemical industry of the German Democratic Republic was very large. With the concerted efforts of the chemical, mechanical, construction, and other industrial sectors, several projects, such as the Schwedt Petroleum Processing Combine, the Guben Chemical Fiber Combine, and the calcium carbide plant of the Republic's second-largest chemical plant, the "Buna" Chemical Plant, have already started construction. These projects are of great scale and are of decisive significance for the future development of the chemical industry. After the Schwedt Petroleum Processing Combine is completed, it will be able to process at least five million tons of petroleum annually, which will transform the chemical industry of the German Democratic Republic from being based on lignite to being based on both lignite and petroleum. The first phase of the Guben Chemical Fiber Combine will be completed in 1963. After it is fully completed, it will be able to produce 9,000 tons of the latest artificial wool "Lanon" and 3,000 tons of "Dedelon" annually. At that time, it will solve the problem of wool shortage in the German Democratic Republic together with other chemical fiber plants.

While carrying out large-scale capital construction, the German Democratic Republic also began socialist reconstruction on the basis of existing equipment in thirty chemical industrial sectors, such as sulfuric acid, chloride, calcium carbide, and chemical fiber, last year. Driven by the "Socialist Labor Collective" movement in various factories, the socialist reconstruction work is producing good results. For example, after the technical improvement of the eight calcium carbide furnaces of the "Buna" Chemical Plant, 25,000 tons more calcium carbide will be produced annually, which can be used to produce 1.16 million car tires or 2.5 million square meters of rubber carpet. The Koswig Sulfuric Acid Plant can double its output with very little additional investment.

Due to the development of the chemical industry, the raw materials used by many industrial sectors are changing. The "Satellite" brand small car made of plastic car bodies has begun mass production in the first batch. The shipbuilding industry is studying the use of chemical products to replace asbestos insulation, and the use of chemical raw materials to manufacture fireproof bulkheads and high-temperature-resistant cabin partitions, etc., to reduce weight, reduce costs, and shorten shipbuilding time. In the "One Thousand Small Items" campaign currently underway to meet the needs of residents, many daily necessities originally made of metal, glass, ceramics, leather, pig bristles, etc., are also being replaced with plastics.

In the development of the chemical industry last year, the labor competition to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team" and the "Socialist Labor Collective" movement played a significant role. At present, there are 3,000 production teams in the chemical industry participating in the movement to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team". In the competition, engineering and technical personnel closely integrated with practice and strengthened their ties with workers in production. A large number of advanced figures have emerged in the chemical industry, and 3,000 advanced workers have become members of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

    德意志民主共和国七年计划的核心
    化学工业年来发展速度很快
    电石、合成橡胶和人造毛等产品产量按人口平均计算已超过西德
    新华社柏林11日电　作为发展国民经济七年计划核心的德意志民主共和国化学工业，在1959年获得了重要成就。这一年，化学工业超额10％完成年度生产计划，规模宏大的基本建设取得重大进展。
    化学工业正日益广泛地向工业、农业和交通运输业提供原料和燃料，在国民经济中发挥日益重要的作用。
    和许多工业部门一样，德意志民主共和国的化学工业在去年也以更快的速度向前发展。电石、合成橡胶和人造毛等重要化学产品在按人口平均计算的产量方面已经超过了西德。全国最大的化工厂——年产三百七十种产品的洛伊纳化学工厂，提前十二天完成了去年的生产计划，为国家增产了价值二千六百万马克的产品。氮肥、磷肥等产品也都超额完成了年度计划，为今年的农业生产提供了更多的化学肥料。
    1959年，德意志民主共和国化学工业的基本建设工程规模十分宏大。在化学、机械、建筑和其他工业部门的通力合作下，施韦特石油加工联合厂、古本化学纤维联合厂、共和国的第二个大化工厂“布纳”化学工厂的电石厂等几项工程已经开工兴建。这些工程规模巨大，而且对今后化学工业的发展具有决定性的意义。施韦特石油加工联合厂建成后，每年至少可以处理五百万吨石油，它将使德意志民主共和国的化学工业从以褐煤为基础变为以褐煤和石油为基础。古本化学纤维联合厂的第一期工程将在1963年完成，它全部建成后，每年可以生产最新的人造毛“拉农”九千吨，“德德隆”三千吨；那时，它将和其他化学纤维厂一道，解决德意志民主共和国羊毛不足的问题。
    在进行大规模的基本建设的同时，德意志民主共和国去年在硫酸、氯化物、电石、化学纤维等三十个化学工业部门中开始了在原有设备基础上进行社会主义改建的工作。在各个工厂的“社会主义劳动集体”运动的推动下，社会主义改建工作正在产生良好的结果。例如，“布纳”化学工厂的八座电石炉，经过改进技术后，每年将多生产二万五千吨电石，可以用来多生产一百一十六万付汽车轮胎或二千五百万平方米的橡皮地毯。科斯维格硫酸厂只要增加极少投资，产量就可以提高一倍。
    由于化学工业的发展，许多工业部门使用的原料正在发生变化。车身用塑料制成的“卫星”牌小汽车已开始首批大量生产。造船工业正在研究用化学产品来代替石棉绝缘，用化学原料来制造防火板壁、耐高温的舱房隔板等，以减轻重量、降低成本和缩短造船时间。在目前正在开展的满足居民需要的“一千件小物件”运动中，许多原来用金属、玻璃、陶瓷、皮革、猪鬃等制造的日用品，也都改用塑料制成。
    在去年化学工业的发展中，争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的劳动竞赛和“社会主义劳动集体”运动起了显著的作用。目前在化学工业部门中参加争取“社会主义劳动队”称号运动的已有三千个生产队。在竞赛运动中，工程技术人员密切结合实际，在生产上加强了同工人的联系。化学工业部门中已经涌现了大批先进人物，有三千名先进职工已成为德国统一社会党党员。
