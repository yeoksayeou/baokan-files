Introducing Several Holiday Reading Materials for Children and Young People

	“Air Force Hero Du Fengrui”

	The China Children's Publishing House has published "Air Force Hero Du Fengrui," written by comrades Lin Yi, Wang Qifu, and others. It vividly narrates the short life of the young Air Force hero, Comrade Du Fengrui, who bravely sacrificed himself to defend the motherland and the people.

	Comrade Du Fengrui was born into a poor peasant family. When he was eight months old, a severe drought forced his parents to leave their hometown with their children in baskets, begging for food everywhere and suffering all kinds of hardships. At the age of ten, Du Fengrui went to work for a landlord to pay off rent. He was like a little lamb thrown into a tiger's den, suffering abuse and bullying... He spent his days carrying water, chopping firewood, herding cattle, and transporting goods... Even if he died from exhaustion, no one would pity him. This bitter life planted seeds of class hatred in the young Fengrui's heart. As soon as his hometown was liberated, Du Fengrui, at the age of fifteen, threw away the whip he used to herd cattle for the landlord and resolutely joined the People's Liberation Army. During his three years in the revolutionary army, he repeatedly performed meritorious deeds. The war tempered his strong revolutionary will.

	In 1952, Du Fengrui, at the age of nineteen, was selected to attend aviation school to learn to fly. Du Fengrui, who came from a poor family and only knew about three hundred characters, studied diligently to realize his great ideal of building a people's air force, defending the motherland, and attacking the enemy. He studied secretly in the toilet at night, and in his quilt... Finally, in the autumn of 1953, he was able to fly a plane alone into the sky, becoming a staunch aerial warrior.

	The young Du Fengrui was also very strict with himself ideologically. He demanded that he establish a firm and unwavering revolutionary outlook on life, always considering the interests of the Party and the people, possessing a selfless and altruistic style, and being able to sacrifice his own interests, even his life, for the interests of the Party and the collective. At this time, Du Fengrui was already a communist fighter who listened to the Party and was determined to move forward in the direction pointed out by the Party.

	In the battle to defend the motherland, Du Fengrui fulfilled his promise—contributing his young life to the motherland and becoming immortal!

	This vivid story points out how we should learn from the air force hero Du Fengrui. This is a good book that all children should read.

	Red Scarf Without an Address

	"Red Scarf Without an Address" is a collection of twenty-four short life stories. It expresses the excellent qualities of Young Pioneers who are selfless and altruistic; it describes the collectivist spirit of children learning from each other and uniting in friendship. Some of the stories in the collection describe how young people contribute to socialist construction with soaring enthusiasm; and how the elderly welcome new life with great interest. These stories are short and lively in form, and the content is easy to understand, suitable for middle-grade elementary school students to read, and can also be told to preschool children.

	The Little Horse Herder and Uncle “Big Boots”

	This is a new book written for children by Yan Yiyan, the screenwriter of the film "Daughter of China." The content describes the growth process of a young soldier in the Anti-Japanese Allied Army.

	The little horse herder's surname is Jiang. His father was captured by the Japanese devils to be a "forced laborer," and his mother was kicked to death by the devils. Eight-year-old Jiang became a young hired hand, herding horses and sheep for the landlord, spending all day in the mountains and forests, developing courage and the ability to hunt wild animals. When the Anti-Japanese Allied Army soldiers first discovered him in the mountains and forests, he was completely a wild child: disheveled and barefoot, thin and black, wrapped in animal skins, carrying stones in his arms, climbing mountains and trees as if walking on flat ground, and hitting stones with great accuracy. The troops took in this wild child, but he escaped that night. The second time, the soldiers met Xiao Jiang again in the mountains and forests, and rescued him from the mouth of a tiger, carrying him hundreds of miles to treat his injuries. Since losing his relatives, Xiao Jiang tasted human warmth for the first time, and he finally stayed with the troops. Under the education of the revolutionary troops, he slowly understood revolutionary principles, completed reconnaissance missions excellently, used all his skills, participated in battle after battle, and finally became a glorious member of the Communist Youth League and an excellent soldier.

	“Red Youth” Volume 7

	Heroic models in the cause of socialist construction are always glorious examples for children to admire and learn from. The two features in Volume 7, "Spread Your Wings and Fly High" and "A True Miner," recount the model deeds of exploration hero Yang Yude and miner Gao Wenzhong. The revolutionary spirit of heroes who are not afraid of hardship and forge ahead bravely will have a profound impact on the growth of children. This volume also publishes two stories of Soviet Young Pioneers, praising the Soviet young heroes' loyalty to the revolution and their resourceful and brave selflessness. These stories are short, simple, concrete, and vivid, and are of great educational significance for cultivating children's patriotism and revolutionary fighting spirit.

    向少年儿童介绍几本寒假读物
    “空军英雄杜凤瑞”
    中国少年儿童出版社出版了林毅、王启夫等同志写的“空军英雄杜凤瑞”。它生动地叙述了为保卫祖国和人民英勇牺牲的年轻的空军英雄杜凤瑞同志的短短的一生。
    杜凤瑞同志出生在贫苦的农家。当他八个月的时候，严重的旱灾逼得他父母只好用筐子挑着儿女离开了家乡，四处讨饭，受尽了折磨。杜凤瑞十岁就去地主家扛活抵租。他好比一只小羊掉进了虎穴，受尽虐待和欺凌……成天价挑水、打柴、放牛、运货……累死了也没人可怜。苦难生活在童年的凤瑞心灵里，就种下了阶级仇恨的种子。家乡一解放，十五岁的杜凤瑞就甩掉了给地主放牛的鞭子，毅然决然地参加了解放军。在三年多的革命军队的生活里，他屡次立功。战争锻炼了他的坚强的革命意志。
    1952年，十九岁的杜凤瑞被选调到航空学校学飞行。穷孩子出身只认识三百来个字的杜凤瑞，为了实现建设人民空军，保卫祖国打击敌人的伟大理想，艰苦地学习着，夜里偷偷地在厕所学习，在被窝里学习……终于在1953年秋天，能够独自一人驾着飞机飞上天了，成了一个坚强的空中战士。
    年轻的杜凤瑞，在思想上对自己的要求也非常严格。他要求自己确立坚定不移的革命人生观，处处为党的利益和人民的利益着想，具有大公无私、舍己为人的风格，能够为党的利益，为集体的利益，牺牲自己的利益，甚至生命。这时的杜凤瑞，已经是一个听党的话，决心朝着党所指引的方向前进的共产主义战士了。
    在保卫祖国的战斗中，杜凤瑞实践了自己的诺言——为祖国贡献了他的年轻的生命而永垂不朽！
    这篇生动的故事，指出了我们应该怎样向空军英雄杜凤瑞学习。这是一本小朋友们都应该读一读的好书。
    不留地址的红领巾
    “不留地址的红领巾”是一本包括二十四个短篇的生活小故事集。表现了少先队员为公忘私、舍己为人的优秀品质；描写了小朋友们互相学习、团结友爱的集体主义精神。集子里还有一部分是写青年人如何以冲天干劲为社会主义建设贡献力量；老年人又怎样兴致勃勃地迎接新的生活。这些故事形式短小活泼，内容通俗易懂，适合小学中年级学生阅读，也可以讲给学前儿童们听。
    小马倌和“大皮靴”叔叔
    这是电影“中华女儿”的编剧颜一烟新近为孩子们写的一本书，内容描写抗日联军中一个小战士的成长过程。
    小马倌姓江，爸爸叫日本鬼子抓了“劳工”，妈妈也被鬼子踢死。八岁的小江，当了小长工，给地主放马牧羊，成天在山林里钻，磨练出一身胆量和打野物的本领。当抗联战士第一次在山林中发现他时，他完全是个野孩子：蓬头赤脚，又瘦又黑，身上缠着兽皮，怀里揣满石子，翻山爬树如走平地，打石子百发百中。部队收留了这个野孩子，可是，当晚他就逃掉了。第二次，战士们又在山林中碰到小江，并且把他从老虎口中救下来，抬着他走了几百里，给他治伤。小江自失去亲人以后，第一次尝到人间的温暖，他终于留在部队里。在革命部队教育下，他慢慢懂得了革命道理，出色地完成了侦察任务，拿出全身本领，参加了一次次的战斗，最后成为光荣的共青团员、优秀的战士。
    “红色少年”第七集
    社会主义建设事业中的英雄模范，永远是少年儿童们敬仰、学习的光辉榜样。第七集中“展翅高飞”、“真正的矿工”两篇特写，记述了勘探英雄阳裕德和矿工高文忠的模范事迹。英雄们不畏艰苦，勇往直前的革命精神，对少年儿童的成长将产生深刻的影响。这一集还刊登了两篇苏联少先队的故事，文中歌颂了苏联少年英雄们忠于革命的品质，和机智勇敢的忘我精神。这些故事都短小朴实，具体生动，对培养少年儿童的爱国主义思想和革命斗志，有很大的教育意义。
