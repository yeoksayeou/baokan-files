Actively Participate in Savings to Support Continued Leap Forward
By Our Commentator

Following the Great Leap Forward in 1958, our national economy achieved another continued Great Leap Forward in 1959, with both industrial and agricultural output exceeding the state plan. In the past year, our savings cause has also made great progress, with savings amounts in both urban and rural areas increasing to varying degrees compared with 1958. This shows that the living standards of our people have further improved, and the hardworking and simple style has been further promoted.

The development of the savings cause is built on the foundation of national economic development. The Great Leap Forward has raised our country's industrial and agricultural production levels to new heights, while also bringing more income to urban and rural people. For example, in Qijia Miaozi Village of Yingzi People's Commune in Linqu County, Shandong Province, the average commune member possessed 780 jin of grain and 97 yuan in cash in 1958. In 1959, the average member possessed 823 jin of grain and 136 yuan in cash. Zheng Zhi, a worker at the Qunli Furniture Production Cooperative in Guangzhou, had a fixed monthly wage of 70 yuan in 1957. He had a family of seven, with no worries about food and clothing, but it was not well-off. The government needed to subsidize his wife's childbirth and his children's schooling. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Zheng Zhi's wages have increased to 80 yuan, and his wife and eldest son have joined the factory to participate in production. The family's monthly income has increased to more than 160 yuan. After people's incomes increase and they have more surplus, they can use more cash to participate in savings. In Qingfengdian People's Commune in Ding County, Hebei Province, the number of farming households participating in savings accounted for 35% of the total number of households in 1957, 49% in 1958, and increased to 79% in 1959, with an average deposit of more than 47 yuan per household. Worker Zheng Zhi had no savings in the past, but now he has saved more than 100 yuan.

The development of savings business is not only the result of increased income for the masses, but also a manifestation of the people's high enthusiasm for socialist construction. The broad masses fully understand that actively participating in savings can support the high-speed development of our country's socialist construction. Socialist construction requires a lot of production and construction funds. Through savings, the state can obtain a sum of funds that can be used centrally. Of course, the source of funds for our socialist construction mainly relies on the internal accumulation of socialist enterprises, and savings are only a very small proportion. But despite this, it also has an indispensable effect. Taking the increase in savings in urban areas nationwide in the fourth quarter of last year as an example, it is equivalent to the entire funds for five Yangtze River bridges. In recent years, thanks to the enthusiastic participation of the broad masses in savings, it has played an active supporting role in the rapid development of our national economy. The rapid development of the national economy has continuously improved people's living standards. The development of production and the increase in savings are mutually cause and effect, and the interests of the country and the interests of individuals are completely consistent. This is a concrete manifestation of the superiority of our socialist system.

1960 is a year of continued leap forward, and we must continue to make arduous efforts. We must not only do everything possible to increase production, but also continue to pay attention to diligence and thrift in our lives. Now, people's incomes have increased compared to the past, and their lives are more prosperous than in the past. However, we must live rich days as if they were poor days, be careful in our calculations, be diligent and thrifty, and keep reserves so that our lives will get better and better. Our people have a glorious tradition of diligence and thrift. In this year's continued leap forward, we will further promote this glorious tradition and participate more enthusiastically in savings, contributing more to supporting socialist construction.

To carry out savings business more extensively, the banking sector must also further improve its work. Carrying out savings business in 1960 has more favorable conditions than in any previous year. The spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party's resolution on carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy has taken root in the hearts of the people, and the masses' awareness has been further enhanced. The continuous Great Leap Forward for two consecutive years has rapidly and effectively changed the face of our country. The broad masses have seen the great construction achievements, and their desire to enthusiastically save and actively support national construction has also been enhanced. With the continued leap forward of production and construction, the income of the masses will increase even more. Therefore, as long as we see these favorable conditions, actively do a good job in publicity and organization, and provide the masses with more convenient conditions, the savings business will definitely be able to develop more extensively.

In the continued leap forward of 1960, let us continue to promote the fine tradition of diligence and thrift, and everyone enthusiastically participate in savings, to do our best to accelerate the cause of socialist construction!

    积极参加储蓄  支援继续跃进
    本报评论员
    紧接着1958年的大跃进，1959年，我国国民经济又实现了继续大跃进，工业、农业总产值都超额完成了国家计划。在过去的一年中，我国储蓄事业也有了很大的发展，全国城乡储蓄额都比1958年有了不同程度的增长。这说明我国人民的生活水平进一步提高了，勤俭朴素的作风进一步发扬了。
    储蓄事业的发展，建筑在国民经济发展的基础上。大跃进把我国工农业生产水平提到了新的高度，同时给城乡人民带来了更多的收入。例如山东省临朐县营子人民公社齐家苗子村的社员，1958年平均每人占有粮食七百八十斤、现金九十七元，1959年平均每人占有粮食增加到八百二十三斤、现金一百三十六元。广州市群力家俬生产合作社工人郑志，1957年每月固定工资七十元、一家七口，衣食不愁，但并不宽裕，妻子生育、孩子上学，都需要政府补助。1958年大跃进以来，郑志的工资提高到八十元，妻子和大儿子进工厂参加生产，全家每月收入增加到一百六十多元。人民的收入增加以后，结余多了，就能够把更多的现金用来参加储蓄。河北省定县清风店人民公社，1957年参加储蓄的农户占总户数的35％，1958年为49％，1959年增加到79％，平均每户存款四十七元多。工人郑志过去没有存款，现已储蓄了一百多元。
    储蓄业务的开展，不仅是人民群众收入增加的结果，同时也是人民群众对社会主义建设事业高度热情的表现。广大人民群众充分懂得，积极参加储蓄，可以支援我国社会主义建设事业高速度发展。进行社会主义建设，需要很多的生产建设资金。通过储蓄，国家就可以得到一笔能够集中使用的资金。固然，我们建设社会主义的资金来源，主要依靠社会主义企业的内部积累，储蓄只是一个很小的比重。但尽管这样，也有不可忽视的作用。以去年第四季度全国城镇增加的储蓄额来说，就相当于五个长江大桥全部工程的资金。几年来，由于广大人民踊跃参加储蓄，对我国国民经济的迅速发展起了积极的支援作用。而国民经济的迅速发展又不断地提高了人民的生活水平。生产的发展和储蓄的增加互为因果，国家利益和个人利益是完全一致的。这正是我国社会主义制度优越性的具体表现。
    1960年是继续跃进的一年，必须继续作艰苦的努力。不仅要千方百计地提高生产，而且在生活中也应当继续注意勤俭节约。现在，人民群众的收入是比过去增加了，生活是比过去富裕了。但是富日子一定要当穷日子过，精打细算，勤俭节约，留有后备，日子才会越过越好。我国人民有着勤俭节约的光荣传统，在今年的继续跃进中，将会进一步发扬这一光荣传统，更踊跃地参加储蓄，为支援社会主义建设贡献更多的力量。
    储蓄业务要有更广泛的开展，银行部门也就要进一步作好工作。开展储蓄业务，1960年比过去任何一年都有更多的有利条件。党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动决议的精神深入人心，群众的觉悟更加提高了。连续两年的大跃进，迅速有效地改变着我国的面貌，广大群众看到了伟大的建设成就，踊跃储蓄，积极支援国家建设的心愿也跟着增强了。随着生产建设的继续跃进，人民群众的收入将有更多的增加。因此，只要看到这些有利条件，积极作好宣传工作和组织工作，给群众更多的便利条件，储蓄业务一定能够更加广泛地开展起来。
    在1960年的继续跃进中，让我们继续发扬勤俭节约的优良作风，人人踊跃参加储蓄，为加速社会主义建设事业尽我们最大的努力吧！
