This newspaper Taiyuan 2nd report. The Chengguan People's Commune in Qin County, Shanxi Province, recently formulated a leap forward production plan for 1960, and has launched a vigorous production preparation campaign throughout the commune.

The Chengguan Commune suffered from varying degrees of natural disasters in 1959, but on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, it achieved continued leap forward; the total value of the commune's industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production reached more than 2.36 million yuan, an increase of 60% over 1958; public accumulation increased by 38%; and member distribution increased by 10.4%. On this basis, the commune party committee led the commune cadres and members to formulate a production plan for 1960: the grain yield is required to reach 450 jin per mu, an increase of 73%, and the total output is more than 21.34 million jin, an increase of 69.4%; the oil yield is 175 jin per mu, an increase of 150%; 23.3 million trees will be planted to realize a hundred walnut gullies and ten thousand grape arbors; the number of large livestock will be developed to 3,930, an increase of 182%; 30,000 pigs, an increase of 80%, an average of 6.2 per household; the number of sheep will be developed to 23,284, an increase of 53%; various poultry will increase by 20%-200% respectively, and basically achieve superior varieties; sideline income will be 550,000 yuan; on the existing basis, another 25 commune-run factories will be established to comprehensively serve agricultural production and accelerate the improvement of the rural economy.

After the realization of this grand plan, the total output value of the commune can reach 4.8 million yuan, an increase of 103.3% over 1959; the total income will be 3.52 million yuan, an increase of 144.3%. After all deductions, the accumulation can reach 1.3 million yuan, and the average income of each member will be 60 yuan, an increase of 42%.

In order to ensure the realization of the plan, the commune will take the following measures: First, strengthen political and ideological work, and adopt methods such as publicity, persuasion, education, and encouragement to continuously boost morale and overcome difficulties. Second, vigorously promote six "ten thousand" projects. Namely: ten thousand mu of large-area high-yield fields, ten thousand mu of wasteland reclamation, ten thousand mu of forest gardens, ten thousand pig farms, ten thousand chicken farms, and ten thousand sheep farms. Adhere to the two-pronged approach of "less planting, high yield, more harvest" and "extensive planting, more production, more harvest," establish ten thousand mu of thousand-jin high-yield fields, mainly planting corn, rice, and sweet potatoes to realize garden-like cultivation; take the direction of large-scale garden-like afforestation, build ten thousand mu of quick-growing forest gardens, and achieve tree planting by everyone and seedling cultivation by every household; take pig raising and manure accumulation as the key link, and run ten thousand-pig farms by the commune; establish ten thousand-sheep farms and ten thousand-chicken farms, and establish comprehensive livestock farms in each district. Seriously implement the "eight-character constitution" of water, fertilizer, soil improvement, breeding, improvement, prevention, industry, and management for the development of animal husbandry, and promote the development of animal husbandry. Third, vigorously grasp the "eight-character constitution" of agriculture. On the basis of basically completing 1,030 water conservancy projects with an irrigation area of 37,000 mu, resolutely fight hard and skillfully through the winter and spring to complete ten canals, one reservoir, and all field surface projects, and use floodwater to irrigate 40,000 mu, accounting for more than 80% of the total area, with an average of 2.2 mu per person. Seize several key seasons to carry out a thousand-vehicle, ten-thousand-dan manure accumulation campaign, and implement year-round manure accumulation, ensuring that each mu is applied with 350 dan of high-quality fertilizer, and the commune, district, and team will all build local fertilizer plants. All land should be ploughed three times, harrowed four times, raked four times, carefully cultivated, and 20,000 mu of land should be made into garden-like fields. Various crops should be rationally and densely planted, improved varieties used, high-yield crops expanded, a local pharmaceutical factory built, and various methods such as mechanical prevention and treatment should be adopted to prevent and control pests and diseases, while establishing crop archives. Fourth, the commune decided to carry out the Red, Diligent, and Clever movement centered on technological reform, to achieve high diligence, high efficiency, high quality, high yield, and high income, and adopt various forms such as collective counterpart competitions, joint name competitions, personal opponent competitions, and over-quota competitions to launch the Red, Diligent, and Clever movement throughout the commune. Focus on the renovation of six types of tools: ploughing, planting, harvesting, threshing, transporting, and irrigating. Establish a tractor farming team to utilize mechanized ploughing on 50% of the flat land and realize semi-mechanization of all cultivated land. Achieve mechanization of canteen stoves, mechanization of corn threshing and rice threshing. Launch a ten thousand-vehicle campaign. Build ten small power stations, electrify processing and milling, and power the processing of pig feed. Adopt the method of creating refined fertilizer and utilizing coarse fertilizer, combining refined and coarse fertilizers, to increase fertilizer quantity, improve fertilizer efficiency, and save labor for manure accumulation and transportation.

In order to realize the continued leap forward in 1960, this commune is launching a mass production upsurge.

This newspaper, Hefei, 2nd report. The Shihe People's Commune in Tongcheng County, Anhui Province, on the basis of mobilizing the masses to summarize the achievements and experiences of the great leap forward in 1959, carefully analyzed the favorable conditions, and formulated the targets and measures for the continued great leap forward of various productions in 1960. Now, a heated winter production upsurge is unfolding throughout the commune.

The Shihe Commune suffered from a more severe hundred-day drought than the previous year, but due to the enormous superiority of the People's Commune, the average grain yield per mu last year reached 1,236 jin, an increase of 19.17% over the great harvest of 1958. The total output value of industry and diversified economy reached 1.5 million yuan, 1.8 times that of the previous year.

In order to better formulate the leap forward plan for 1960, the commune party committee successively held three cadre meetings and mass meetings after the autumn harvest, earnestly summed up experience, analyzed favorable conditions, and formulated various great leap forward production plans. This plan is: in 1960, the grain yield per mu is guaranteed to be 1,600 jin, striving for 2,000 jin; the area of oil crops will be expanded by 70%; and the total output value of cash crops such as cotton will be increased by another 67% compared with last year. In terms of commune-run industry, in addition to consolidating the existing eleven factories, another twenty-eight factories such as local chemical fertilizer factories will be built, and one hydroelectric power station. The number of pigs raised will be 40,000, three times more than last year, an average of 2.9 per person. The afforestation area will be doubled compared to the existing area. The amount of fish raised will be 2.5 times that of last year. After the realization of these plans, the total income of the commune in 1960 will increase by more than 1.5 times compared with last year. The broad masses of cadres and people, after formulating this advanced and reliable plan, confidently believe that as long as they boost their morale, it is entirely possible to realize the above indicators. They analyzed that there are many favorable conditions for the great leap forward in 1960: ① The general line of socialist construction of the Party is more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the continued implementation of the general line is the fundamental guarantee for realizing the great leap forward in 1960; ② Due to the in-depth implementation of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the right-leaning conservative thinking among cadres has been further criticized, and the broad masses of people are full of energy and the situation is infinitely good; ③ Since the great leap forward in 1958, a large number of activists and advanced figures have emerged, adding a group of backbone forces for the continued great leap forward in 1960; ④ After two years of great leap forward, rich experience has been accumulated, and a solid material foundation has been prepared for the great leap forward next year; ⑤ After the completion of water conservancy projects such as the Wangyang Reservoir in winter, the entire commune will realize self-flowing irrigation this year, and a good harvest can be ensured even if there is no rain for a hundred days; ⑥ The manure accumulation movement, which focuses on raising livestock and carries out the four-pronged approach of raising, planting, accumulating, and manufacturing fertilizer, will provide better fertilizer conditions this year than last year; ⑦ With the development of the socialist education movement, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and people has been greatly improved; ⑧ The commune's leadership and labor force have been comprehensively and rationally arranged, guaranteeing a comprehensive great leap forward organizationally; ⑨ The area of ​​overwintering crops sown last year is large, the quality of cultivation is good, and the growth is currently good. Continuing to strengthen field management will set off the first shot for a good harvest this year.

In order to fully realize next year's plan, the commune party committee has taken a series of advanced measures. These measures are: First, vigorously develop water conservancy. The Wangyang Reservoir, which was originally planned to be completed in two years, is scheduled to be fully repaired in winter. And build a new power station. Second, grasp the weak links. Focus on two things: one is to accumulate more fertilizer and improve the soil, which will turn 1,500 mu of low-yielding fields into high-yielding fields; the other is to vigorously develop pig raising, and the current focus is on building factories, grasping seed sources, grasping the planting and collection of feed, and ensuring 40,000 pigs raised next year. Third, vigorously carry out tool reform, further improve labor organization, and improve labor efficiency. Through methods such as dividing battle lines and dividing specialties, people can make the best of their talents and each can find their place, ensuring a comprehensive leap forward on all fronts. Fourth, on the premise of ensuring the completion of water conservancy on time and with quality, arrange a certain amount of labor to form a professional team and focus on the field management of overwintering crops.

After the Shihe Commune's broad masses of cadres and people formulated an advanced plan and measures to ensure the realization of this plan, their goals became clear and their enthusiasm increased sharply. Since the beginning of winter, the commune has mobilized more than 14,000 laborers to form three teams for water management, field management, and sideline production, and vigorously promoted winter production, which has achieved great results. Since the Wangyang Reservoir broke ground in late November last year, the daily progress has increased from the original 550 cubic meters to the current 8,500 cubic meters, and the daily work efficiency per person has also increased tenfold. In terms of field management, it is also done earlier and more meticulously than in 1958. The 14,000 mu of overwintering crops in the commune have all been weeded and fertilized once, of which 5,800 mu are high-yield fields, weeded and fertilized twice. The income from winter industry and sideline production has reached more than 480,000 yuan, an increase of about double that in the same period in 1958. In addition, the commune also drew more than 600 people to specialize in the construction of pig pens and pig farms. At present, more than 400 pens have been built, 450 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed to plant pig feed, and 1.5 million jin of pig feed have been collected. The broad masses of cadres and people in the commune are in high spirits and full of energy. They are determined to make greater achievements to prepare for the completion of the leap forward plan in 1960. (Attached picture)

    为了确保计划实现，公社将采取如下措施：一、加强政治思想工作，采取宣传、说服、教育、鼓动等办法，不断地鼓足干劲，克服困难。二、大闹六个“万”字。即：万亩大面积丰产方、万亩荒地、万亩林园、万头猪场、万只鸡场、万只羊场。坚持“少种、高产、多收”和“广种多产、多收”两条腿走路的方针，建立万亩千斤大面积丰产田，以种植玉米、水稻、红薯三种作物为主，实现园田化；要以大地园林化为方向，大建万亩速成林园，并且要做到人人植树，户户育苗；要以养猪积肥为纲，社办万头猪场；建立万只羊场、万只鸡场，区区建立综合牧场。认真贯彻水、增、料、繁、改、防、工、管发展畜牧的“八字皇历”，促进畜牧业的发展。三、狠抓农业“八字宪法”。在基本完成一千零三十项水利工程，灌溉面积达三万七千亩的基础上，坚决苦战、巧战一冬一春，完成十渠一库和全部田面工程，利用洪水浇地达到四万亩，占总面积80％以上，每人平均二点二亩。抓住几个主要季节开展千车万担的积肥战役，同时贯彻常年积肥，每亩保证施高质肥三百五十担，社、区、队都建土化肥厂。全部土地做到三耕、四耙、四耢、精耕细作，两万亩土地要求实现园田化。样样作物合理密植，优种，扩大高产作物，建立土药厂一座，采取机械防治等多种办法防治病虫害，同时建立作物档案。四、公社决定开展以技术改革为中心的红勤巧运动，达到高勤、高效、高质、高产、高收，采用集体对口赛、联名赛、个人对手赛、超定额赛等多种形式，在全社范围内掀起红勤巧运动。以耕、种、收、打、运、灌溉等六种工具为主进行革新。成立拖拉机耕作小组，使50％平地利用机耕，所有耕地实现半机械化。做到食堂灶具机械化，玉米脱粒、水稻脱粒机械化。开展万辆车运动。办十处小型电站，加工碾面电力化，养猪饲料加工动力化，采取创造精肥和利用粗肥，精粗相结合的办法，增加肥量、提高肥效，节省积肥、运肥用工。
    为实现1960年继续跃进，这个公社正在掀起一个群众性的生产高潮。
    本报合肥2日电　安徽省桐城县石河人民公社在发动群众总结1959年大跃进的成绩与经验的基础上，认真分析了有利条件，制定了1960年各项生产继续大跃进的指标和措施。现在，一个热火朝天的冬季大生产高潮正在全社展开。
    石河公社去年遭受了比前年更严重的百日大旱，但由于发挥了人民公社的巨大优越性，去年的粮食亩产量平均达到了一千二百三十六斤，比大丰收的1958年还增产了19．17％。工业和多种经济总产值达到了一百五十万元，为前年的一点八倍。
    为了更好地订出1960年的跃进规划，公社党委在秋收后就连续召开了三次干部会议和群众大会，认真总结了经验，分析了有利条件，制定了各项生产大跃进规划。这个规划是：1960年粮食亩产保证一千六百斤，争取二千斤；油料作物面积扩大70％；棉花等经济作物总产值比去年再提高67％。社办工业方面，除巩固现有的十一个厂外，还将新建土化肥等工厂二十八个，水力发电站一个。生猪饲养量为四万头，比去年增加三倍，平均每人二点九头。造林面积将比现有面积扩大两倍。养鱼量将为去年的二点五倍。实现这些规划后，1960年全社总收入将比去年增加一点五倍多。广大干部和群众，在制定这个先进可靠的规划以后，满怀信心地认为：只要鼓足干劲，实现上述指标是完全可能的。他们分析了1960年大跃进有很多有利条件：①党的社会主义建设总路线更加深入人心，总路线的继续贯彻，是实现1960年大跃进的根本保证；②由于党的八届八中全会精神的深入贯彻，干部中的右倾保守思想进一步的受到了批判，广大群众干劲冲天，形势无限好；③1958年大跃进以来，涌现了大批的积极分子和先进人物，为1960年继续大跃进增添了一批骨干力量；④经过两年大跃进，积累了丰富经验，也为明年大跃进准备了雄厚的物质基础；⑤冬季完成汪洋水库等水利工程后，今年全社将实现灌溉自流化，百日无雨也能确保丰收；⑥目前以养为主开展养、种、积、制四路攻肥的积肥运动，今年肥料的条件将比去年更好；⑦开展社会主义教育运动，广大干部和群众的社会主义觉悟大大提高；⑧全社领导力量与劳力已作了全面的合理的安排，从组织上保证全面大跃进；⑨去年播种的越冬作物面积大、耕作质量好，目前生长良好，再继续加强田间管理，就为今年丰收打响第一炮。
    为完满地实现明年规划，公社党委已采取了一系列的先进措施。这些措施是：第一，大兴水利。原计划两年完成的汪洋水库决定在冬季全部修好。并新建发电站一所。第二，抓薄弱环节。主要抓二条，一是多积肥料、改良土壤，将把一千五百亩低产田变为高产田；二是大力发展养猪生产，当前主要抓建厂，抓种源，抓饲料的种植和采集，保证明年养猪四万头。第三，大搞工具改革，进一步改进劳动组合提高劳动效率。通过分战线、分专业等办法，做到人尽其才，各得其所，保证各个战线全面跃进。第四，在保证水利按时按质完成的前提下，安排一定数量的劳力成立专业队，狠抓越冬作物的田间管理。
    石河公社广大干部和群众在订出先进规划和保证实现这个规划的措施以后，目标明确，干劲陡增。入冬以来，全社发动了一万四千多名劳力，组成了治水、田间管理、副业生产三套班子，大闹冬季生产，已取得很大成绩。汪洋水库在去年11月下旬破土动工以来，日进度已由原来五百五十方提高到目前的八千五百方，每人日工效也提高十倍。在田间管理方面，也比1958年做得早做得精细。全社一万四千亩越冬作物目前已全部锄草、施肥一次，其中有五千八百亩丰产田，锄草、施肥二次。冬季工业、副业收入已达四十八万多元，比1958年同期增加一倍左右。此外，全社还抽出六百多人，专搞猪圈、猪场的建设。目前已建圈四百多间，开荒种植猪饲料四百五十亩，并采集猪饲料一百五十万斤。全社广大干部和群众斗志昂扬，干劲冲天，他们决心以更大的成绩为完成1960年的跃进规划做好准备。（附图片）
