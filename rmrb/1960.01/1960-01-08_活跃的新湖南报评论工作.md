    Active Commentary Work of the New Hunan Daily

    The commentary work of the New Hunan Daily has been very active recently. In the two months from November 1 to December 31 last year, it published 101 editorials, sometimes as many as two or three a day. In addition, in those two months it published 28 essays in the "Short Weapons Collection," 24 short articles, 7 ideological commentaries, 24 commentator articles, 13 essays, and 12 editor's notes. Almost every edition had several commentaries.

    Increasing commentary is an objective requirement placed on the newspaper by the current situation. Inspired by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the 36 million people of Hunan are consolidating and continuously developing the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Every day, the newspaper sees many new things and new problems. As the organ of the Provincial Party Committee, it has the responsibility to elucidate the Party's General Line and its policies based on the major events happening in the province every day, to guide the direction of action, and to promote the continuous development of the movement.

    The main content of the New Hunan Daily's editorials is to expound on the major issues in current production and mass movements, covering a wide range of aspects. Among the 101 editorials, 47 were on agriculture, 32 on industry and transportation, 12 on finance and trade, and 10 on ideological fields and culture and education. It paid attention to highlighting the center of industrial and agricultural production, and also paid attention to grasping the major issues in the development of various movements on various fronts. In the agricultural aspect, while highlighting large-scale water conservancy, editorials were also published on major issues related to the production and life of the masses, such as pig raising, fertilizer accumulation, pest control, deep plowing and soil improvement, diversified operations, tool reforms, running canteens well, and even growing more vegetables and storing enough firewood. Taking the current propaganda of the water conservancy construction movement as an example, 17 editorials have been published. First, with the themes of "Water Conservancy Construction is an Important Condition for Changing the Face of the Countryside" and "A Magnificent Picture of Beautifying Mountains and Rivers," combined with comprehensive news, typical reports, and charts of the tens of thousands of people in the province participating in water management, moving thousands of mountains, and opening up tens of thousands of rivers, it vigorously publicized the enormous role of large-scale water conservancy in promoting the continued leap forward of the province's national economy, and encouraged and mobilized the enthusiasm of the people of the province in building water conservancy projects. At the same time, in coordination with typical examples, it closely grasped several important links in the water conservancy construction movement: first, through a region, connecting large, medium, and small water conservancy projects to form a complete irrigation system of "hundreds of canals meeting and ten thousand waters returning to their source," the editorial pointed out the correct direction of water conservancy construction. Second, through a large number of typical examples, five consecutive editorials highlighted the high-efficiency movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. Third, it grasped the production and supply of cement and steel for ensuring the province's 130 large and medium-sized projects, as well as the political and ideological work and living arrangements of the vast water management masses.

    Editorials vary in length. Some are long-range "heavy artillery" editorials, which, at the turning point of a movement or campaign, improve and promote the entire movement from a fundamental ideological perspective. For example, the November 17th article "Facts are Speaking, History is Testifying" used the sharp contrast between Hunan's special bumper harvest of double-cropping late rice in the past year, which overcame a once-in-a-century severe drought, and the barren land and starvation of several major drought years before liberation, to summarize the great significance of the special bumper harvest of late autumn crops and the unparalleled power of the people's communes from a historical perspective. This editorial aroused strong reactions among the vast number of readers and promoted the current agricultural production movement centered on water and fertilizer. Another type is directly addressing the important links of current production and movement, most of which are relatively short and concise. The shortest one, "Grasp the High-Efficiency Movement on Water Conservancy and Road Construction Sites" (December 3), was only 344 characters, with clear arguments and powerful explanations, and was also well received by readers.

    If editorials are compared to "heavy artillery," then "Short Weapons Collection" is a sharp "dagger" in the New Hunan Daily. It was produced in the anti-Rightist struggle, sharply refuting the various attacks and slanders of the Right opportunists against the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. The writing style of "Short Weapons Collection" is diverse. Some are based on refuting a specific argument with reason, some use metaphors and images to depict the ugly faces and souls of Right opportunists, and some focus on praising the new era and new style. This type of essay is sometimes published together with news, and the subject matter is becoming more and more extensive.

    There is also a type of short article that falls between essays and editorials and commentator articles. It uses a short and concise form to raise new issues in work, or to play the role of "finishing touch" in coordination with new issues. For example, "Recommend Water Embroidery Flower" (a type of wild pig feed) was welcomed by the vast number of readers. In the month and a half from November 1 to December 15 last year, there were 16 articles of this form. In addition, there is also a type of "ideological commentary" that directly faces the broad masses to conduct ideological education, such as "How Can We Live Peacefully in the Middle Reaches?" and "Everyone Should Have Great Ambitions."

    Among these commentaries, there is an eye-catching short article published under the name "Shang Zhen," such as "Turning Yellow Soil into Gold," "Not Advancing is Retreating," "The Old Almanac No Longer Works," and "What Does the New Agricultural Implement Skills Competition Show?" "Shang Zhen" is the collective pen name of the Provincial Party Committee writing group headed by Zhang Pinghua, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee. These articles are easy to understand and often use a specific thing to explain a truth, which has had a profound impact on the vast number of readers.

    In strengthening its commentary work, the New Hunan Daily closely relied on the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the support of Party committees at all levels. At the same time, the editorial department adopted the mass line method of collective research and everyone participating, breaking the mysterious concept in commentary writing and cultivating a basic writing team. According to their experience, the activity of commentary is combined with and promotes the improvement of the quality of commentary. They are constantly improving the combat effectiveness of commentary in continuous writing exercises.

### 活跃的新湖南报评论工作

    活跃的新湖南报评论工作
    新湖南报近来的评论工作很活跃。从去年11月1日至12月31日的两个月内，发表社论一百零一篇，有时一天多至两篇、三篇；此外，两个月中还发表了杂文“短兵集”二十八篇，短文二十四篇，思想评论七篇，评论员文章二十四篇，论文十三篇，编后随笔十二篇。差不多每天各版都有几篇评论。
    增加评论，这是客观形势对报纸提出的要求。湖南三千六百多万人民在党的八届八中全会鼓舞下，巩固持续地发展着增产节约运动，每天报纸上都会出现许许多多新事物和新问题。作为省委的机关报，有责任根据全省每天发生的重大事件，阐明党的总路线和党的方针政策，指引行动方向，推动运动持续不断地向前发展。
    新湖南报社论的主要内容是阐述当前生产和群众运动中的重大问题，涉及的方面很广。一百零一篇中，农业方面的四十七篇，工业、交通方面的三十二篇，财贸方面的十二篇，思想领域和文教等方面的十篇；既注意突出工农业生产中心，也注意抓住各个战线各项运动发展中的重大问题。在农业方面，在突出大兴水利的同时，对于养猪、积肥、除虫、深耕改良土壤、多种经营、工具改革、办好食堂，以至多种蔬菜、储足干柴等等关系广大群众生产、生活的重大问题，都发表了社论。以当前兴修水利运动的宣传为例，就已发表社论十七篇。先是以“兴修水利是改变农村面貌的重要条件”、“美化山河的宏伟图景”为题，配合全省参加治水的千千万万群众移山千座、开河万里的综合新闻、典型报道和图表，大张旗鼓地宣传了大兴水利对促进全省国民经济继续跃进的巨大作用，鼓舞和调动了全省人民兴修水利的积极性。同时配合典型，紧紧抓住兴修水利运动中的几个重要环节：一是通过一个地区，把大、中、小水利工程串联起来，组成一个“百渠会师，万水归宗”的完整灌溉系统的典型，发表社论指出兴修水利的正确方向。二是通过大量的典型，连续发表五篇社论，突出地宣传了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的高工效运动。三是抓住了保证全省一百三十项大、中型工程的水泥与钢材的生产和供应问题，以及广大的治水群众的政治思想工作和生活安排问题。
    社论的类型有长有短。有一些远射程的“重炮”社论，是在一个运动或战役的转折关头，从根本思想上来提高和推动整个运动的。如11月17日的“事实在发言，历史在作证”，就通过湖南去年双季晚稻战胜百年罕见的特大干旱获得特大丰收，与解放前几个大旱年赤地千里饿殍载道的鲜明对比，从历史的高度总结了晚秋作物特大丰收的伟大意义和人民公社的无比威力。这篇社论在广大读者中引起了强烈的反应，推动了当前以水、肥为中心的农业生产运动。还有一类是直接针对当前生产和运动的重要环节发言的，大多数比较短小精悍，最短的一篇“大抓水利和筑路工地的高工效运动”（12月3日）只有三百四十字，论点鲜明，阐述有力，也得到读者的好评。
    如果把社论比作“重炮”，那么，“短兵集”就是新湖南报上的一种犀利的“匕首”。它产生在反右倾斗争中，尖锐地驳斥了右倾机会主义分子对党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社的种种攻击和污蔑。“短兵集”的写法是多种多样的，有的是针对某一个具体论点据理驳斥的，有的是通过比喻和形象，勾画出右倾机会主义者的丑恶嘴脸和灵魂的，有的侧重于歌颂新时代新风格，这种杂文，有时配合新闻一起发表，题材越来越广泛。
    还有一种介于杂文与社论、评论员文章之间的短文。它以短小精悍的形式，提出工作中的新问题，或者配合新问题起“画龙点睛”的作用。如“推荐水绣花”（一种野生的猪饲料），就受到了广大读者的欢迎。这种形式的短文，在去年11月1日到12月15日的一个半月中共有十六篇。此外，还有一种直接面向广大群众进行思想教育的“思想评论”如“中游岂可安居”、“人人立大志”等等。
    在这些评论中，有一种引人注目的以“尚真”名义发表的短文，如“黄土变成金”、“不进则退”、“老皇历行不通了”、“新农具使用能手比武大会说明了什么”等。“尚真”是以省委第一书记张平化同志为首的省委写作小组的集体笔名。这些文章深入浅出，往往是通过一项具体事情来阐明一个道理，在广大读者中产生了深刻的影响。
    新湖南报在加强评论工作中，紧紧地依靠了省委的领导和各级党委的支持。同时，编辑部采取集体研究、人人动手的群众路线方法，破除了评论写作中的神秘观念，培养了一支基本写作队伍。据他们的体会，评论的活跃与评论质量的提高是相互结合相互促进的。他们正在不断的写作锻炼中，继续提高评论的战斗力。
