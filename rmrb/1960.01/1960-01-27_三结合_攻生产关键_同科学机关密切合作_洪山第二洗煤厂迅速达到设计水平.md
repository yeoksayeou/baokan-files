Coal Washing

(Our Zibo Dispatch, January 26th) The Hongshan Coal Mine No. 2 Coal Washery in Zibo, Shandong, mobilized the masses to engage in vigorous technical innovation. Shortly after being put into production, its daily output rapidly reached the design requirements.

The Hongshan No. 2 Coal Washery is a simple coal washery built using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, with an annual raw coal washing capacity of 900,000 tons. The factory started construction in April 1959 and was completed and officially handed over for production in November. When washing coal initially, due to a lack of experience in using this type of simple coal washery equipment, the operation was abnormal, and the daily raw coal washing volume only reached about one-sixth of the design requirement. To quickly reach the design level, the factory's Party branch immediately mobilized employees to offer suggestions and contribute ideas, launching a vigorous technical innovation campaign. After two months of efforts, employees put forward forty-nine rationalization proposals. As a result, the daily raw coal input of Building B quickly reached about 1,600 tons, peaking at 2,090 tons, exceeding the design capacity by 16.2%; the recovery rate of clean coal increased by 1%.

In the technical innovation movement, the Hongshan No. 2 Coal Washery frequently held "three-way combination" technical research meetings, which played a decisive role in solving key production problems. In the early stages of production, the blower's air pressure was too high, the air volume was too large, the air duct became hot, and backflow occurred, affecting normal operation. Addressing this key issue, veteran workers, technicians, and workshop cadres studied changing the blower from two stages to one stage and adding a vent valve to the air duct, so that the air pressure adapted to the performance of the jig. To prevent powdered coal from clumping, they also devised a method to add a water spray pipe and iron grate to the inlet of the coal washing machine. At the same time, they adjusted the horizontal wind valve and adopted methods such as using more air and less water, increasing the raw coal processing volume from twelve tons per square meter per hour to fourteen tons. When learning from and applying the advanced experience of fraternal factories, the Hongshan No. 2 Coal Washery did not simply copy it, but rather adopted and applied it in light of the specific conditions of its own factory. Hydrocyclones were the experience of other factories, but in promoting them, they experimented and improved them, adding covers to the total overflow flume of the hydrocyclones to seal them, and changing the slope of the flume to accelerate the water flow, avoiding splashing. At the same time, they further replaced the iron sleeve gate at the bottom flow port with a rubber tube and used an adjustment screw clip to appropriately control the bottom flow gate, making the hydrocyclone more perfect, improving the clean coal recovery rate, and reducing the amount of coal slime to be treated outside the factory.

Another characteristic of the factory's technical innovation is its close cooperation with scientific research departments. Their joint research with Shandong University on using chemical methods to accelerate coal slime sedimentation is one example. According to actual application tests, using bone glue powder chemical sedimentation can make the coal slime sedimentation speed seven times faster: this can greatly improve the turnover rate of the coal slime sedimentation pond, achieving the requirements of fast sedimentation, fast excavation, and fast transportation.

The Ministry of Coal Industry recently held a national on-site meeting in Zibo to enable simple coal washeries to quickly resume normal production, introducing the factory's experience.

    “三结合”攻生产关键　同科学机关密切合作
    洪山第二洗煤厂迅速达到设计水平
    洗煤
    本报淄博26日电　山东淄博洪山煤矿第二洗煤厂发动群众大闹技术革新，投入生产后不久，日产量迅速达到了设计要求。
    洪山第二洗煤厂是用土洋结合的办法建成的简易洗煤厂，年洗原煤能力为九十万吨。这座工厂是1959年4月份开工兴建的，11月份建成并正式移交生产。在开始进行洗煤时，由于对使用这种简易洗煤厂的设备缺乏经验，运转不正常，日洗原煤量只达设计要求的六分之一左右。为了迅速达到设计水平，这个厂的党支部当即发动职工献策献计，大闹技术革新。经过两个月的努力，职工们提出了合理化建议四十九项。结果使乙型楼的日入洗原煤量很快达到一千六百吨左右，最高达到二千零九十吨，超过设计能力16．2％；精煤回收率提高1％。
    洪山第二洗煤厂在技术革新运动中经常召开“三结合”技术研究会议，这对解决生产关键问题起了决定性的作用。生产初期，由于鼓风机风压太高，风量过大，风管发热，产生回风现象，影响正常运转。针对这一关键，老工人、技术人员、车间干部就研究把鼓风机由二级改为一级，并在风管上加设了放风门，使风压适应了跳汰机的性能。为了防止粉煤成团，他们又想办法在洗煤机的入料口，加设了喷水管和铁篦子。同时对卧式风阀进行了调整，采取多用风、少用水等办法，原煤处理量由每平方米每小时十二吨，提高到十四吨。在学习和运用兄弟厂的先进经验时，洪山第二洗煤厂也不是生搬硬套，而是结合本厂具体情况，加以采纳运用的。水力漩流器是外厂的经验，但他们在推广时边试验、边改进，在漩流器的总溢流水槽上加设了盖子，予以封闭，并改变了水槽的倾斜度，加快水流速度，避免了溅水。同时，还进一步将底流口的铁套筒闸门，换上了胶皮管，使用了调节罗丝卡子，来适当控制底流闸门，使水力漩流器更加完善，提高了精煤回收率，也减少了厂外煤泥的处理量。
    这个厂技术革新的另一个特点是与科学研究部门进行密切合作。他们和山东大学共同研究用化学法加速煤泥沉淀，就是一个例子。据实际应用试验，采用骨胶粉化学沉淀法，可使煤泥沉淀速度快七倍：这就可以大大提高煤泥沉淀池的周转率，达到快沉、快挖、快运的要求。
    煤炭工业部最近在淄博召开了使简易洗煤厂尽快正常生产的全国现场会，介绍了这个厂的经验。
