Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th: Shanghai's commercial departments have already transferred over 60,000 tons of daily-use industrial products in the first twenty-two days of January to supply the urban and rural people of the whole country for a happy Spring Festival. This quantity is more than half greater than the same period last year. Transfers are continuing these days.

    In 1959, the total value of industrial product purchases by Shanghai's commercial departments increased by 38% compared to 1958, resulting in robust inventories of daily-use industrial products. On this basis, the commercial departments have been working intensely since the beginning of the new year to transfer Spring Festival supplies to various locations. Among these are large quantities of underwear, cotton cloth, shoes, hats, washbasins, aluminum pots, thermos bottles, cigarettes and other staple commodities, as well as many inexpensive and good quality small commodities suitable for the needs of rural people. The amount of plastic hair clips, silk bottle flowers, hair flowers, and trinkets transferred in January increased by half to several times compared to the same period last year. Five thousand boxes of crepe paper used for festive decorations were shipped out, along with more than ten thousand dozens of paper bead flowers, and more than fifty tons of red paper and oiled paper for writing Spring Festival couplets and slogans. In order to enrich the festive lives of the broad masses of peasants, the various cultural, recreational, sports supplies and folk instruments supplied by Shanghai's commercial departments in January have all increased to varying degrees. Of the more than 600,000 records shipped out, more than half are opera records favored by peasants, such as Peking opera, Yue opera, Henan opera, Qin opera, and Huangmei opera, the vast majority of which are newly recorded. This month, the Shanghai Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station also supplemented the supply of children's toys worth more than 1.1 million yuan to various places, equivalent to about 40% of the originally contracted supply for the first quarter.

    In order to transport Spring Festival supplies to various locations as quickly as possible, the relevant purchasing and supply stations for Shanghai department stores, knitwear, and cultural supplies have all established specialized working groups, led directly by the managers to dispatch and allocate goods. The commercial departments, on the one hand, send people to support factory packaging and transportation, so that products can be shipped quickly; on the other hand, they further strengthen cooperation with the transportation departments, implementing joint offices at major freight stations and ports to uniformly arrange the transportation of goods. A large number of commercial personnel also go to stations and ports to assist in moving and loading goods. The commercial departments also work with the railway and shipping departments to carry out "piggyback" transportation, making full use of the empty tonnage of various freight cars, baggage cars, refrigerated cars, passenger ships, and coal ships to carry goods. At present, the average daily volume of goods transported by this method accounts for about 15% of the total volume transported.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 25th: The streets of Chongqing are already showing a thriving pre-holiday scene. More than 70,000 commercial employees throughout the city have made proper arrangements for the supply of materials and living services for the people of the city to celebrate the Spring Festival.

    At present, a large number of festive supplies have been distributed to grassroots stores in various districts, counties, and industrial and mining areas. There are more than one hundred kinds of main Spring Festival supply items, which is an increase compared to last year's Spring Festival. The fronts, stores, and windows of many stores have been decorated with a new look. The clothing, towels, socks, and bedsheets supplied by department stores are not only available in many colors and patterns, but also of good quality. Cultural supplies stores have purchased more than 800 palace lanterns and more than 2,000 dozens of streamers to supply the masses for the holiday. Employees of candy processing plants have been particularly busy recently, and the variety of candies and biscuits they produce has increased from more than 400 on weekdays to 700. The commercial departments have also prepared glutinous rice balls, fillings for glutinous rice balls, water-milled New Year cakes, and other foods that people like to eat. Various state-owned restaurants and snack bars plan to increase the variety of dishes during the Spring Festival. More than 80 restaurants that supply special flavored foods such as Jiuyuan buns, Hangzhou glutinous rice balls, shadow beef, and economy cold noodles are preparing to supply more than 120 kinds of food during the Spring Festival. The commercial departments have also added temporary supply points, night-time business points, and mobile dining cars at various transportation hubs and wharfs to facilitate dining for passing travelers.

    Before the festival, hundreds of hotels, bathhouses, barbershops, and laundries throughout the city have added service items, and the service work is even more attentive. Barbershops and bathhouses have extended their business hours starting on the 23rd. Barbershops in the urban area have also organized fifteen mobile service teams to provide services to factories and residential sections. Laundry employees are working overtime day and night to wash clothes, shortening the time to pick up clothes, and ensuring that all clothes received for washing before the Spring Festival are washed and sent out. More than 300 tea gardens throughout the city are actively preparing cultural and recreational programs such as Sichuan opera, Peking opera, and folk art for the holidays. The Red Flag Tea Garden has invited song and dance troupes to perform at the tea garden during the Spring Festival.
