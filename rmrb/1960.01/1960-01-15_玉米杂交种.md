A Little Knowledge

    Corn is a relatively high-yielding crop. Planting corn hybrid seeds can result in even higher yields, generally increasing production by 20% to 50%.

    What are corn hybrid varieties? They are seeds produced by cross-pollination between two corn varieties; that is, a corn variety in which the female flowers receive pollen from the male flowers of another corn variety, and the resulting seeds are the corn seeds obtained after pollination.

    Why can corn hybrid varieties increase production? This is mainly because the hybridization of two corn varieties creates a hybrid vigor effect. In other words, the advantages of the two corn varieties used as parents are combined in the offspring hybrid. Therefore, corn hybrids generally exhibit robust plants, stronger resistance to various disasters, larger ears, more kernels, and higher yields. The principle of using hybrid vigor to achieve increased production is the same as using the mating of horses and donkeys to produce strong, sturdy, and powerful mules.

    The method for producing corn hybrid varieties generally involves first planting two rows of the male parent corn variety, then planting two rows of the female parent corn variety, and then alternating planting in rows of two, two rows at a time. When the corn is about to flower, frequent inspections are necessary. When the tassels on the female parent emerge three to four inches from the top, they should be removed before flowering, so that all the female parent's ears (corn cobs) rely entirely on receiving pollen from the male parent to set seeds. In this way, the corn produced on the female parent is all hybrid varieties, which can be used to increase production the following year. The corn produced on the male parent can still be used as parent seeds the following year. Special attention should be paid to ensuring that the flowering periods of the two parent varieties are close, to avoid failure of pollination. At the same time, they should be separated from the surrounding corn (by about 500 to 600 feet) to avoid cross-pollination.

    When using corn hybrid varieties as feed, one should also pay attention to selecting corn varieties that still have green stems and leaves after maturity during the selection process, and ensuring that this characteristic can be maintained in the hybrid variety. In this way, not only can the corn kernels be used as feed, but the stems and leaves can also be entirely used as silage, greatly increasing the utilization rate of corn and increasing feed production.

    玉米杂交种
    玉米是一种比较高产的农作物。如果利用玉米杂交种子播种，可以获得更高的产量，一般能增产百分之二十到百分之五十。
    什么是玉米杂交种？就是两种玉米经过串粉杂交而产生的种子；也就是一个玉米品种，在雌花上接受另一个玉米种的雄花花粉，受粉以后所结的玉米种子。
    玉米杂交种为什么能增产？主要是因为两个玉米种，杂交以后，产生了杂交优势的作用。也就是说作亲本的两个玉米种的优点，都会合到后代的杂交种当中了。所以，玉米杂交种一般地表现植株健壮，抵抗各种灾害的能力较强，穗大、粒多、产量高。利用杂交优势取得增产的道理，和利用马与驴交配能够产生身强、体壮、力量大的骡子的道理一样。
    配制玉米杂交种的方法，一般是先播种两行父本玉米种，然后再播种两行母本玉米种，以后都是两行、两行地间隔播种。在玉米将要开花的时候，要勤检查，母本顶上的雄花露出三至四寸，不等开花，就把它拔去，让所有的母本雌花（玉米棒）完全依靠接受父本的花粉来结种子。这样，母本上结的玉米都是杂交种，明年利用可以增产；父本上结的玉米，明年还可当作亲本种子。配制杂交种要特别注意父母两个亲本种的开花期要接近，免得不能受粉；同时还要和外围的玉米离开（约五百至六百尺），免得串粉。
    利用玉米杂交种作饲料，在选种过程中，还应该注意选择成熟以后茎叶依然青绿的玉米品种，并使这种特性在杂交种中能够保持。这样，不仅玉米果实可以作饲料，茎叶还可全部作青贮饲料，大大提高了玉米的利用率，增加了饲料的产量。
