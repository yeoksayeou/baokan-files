Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 4th. The Czechoslovak "Red Right Daily" published a commentary on January 4th entitled "Who Are They Speaking For?" exposing the true colors of American cold war advocates.

The commentary said: As an increasing number of the world's public voices call for strengthening peace, one can still hear the clamor of those cold war advocates who have their own "program." One of them is the Governor of New York, billionaire Rockefeller. The Rockefeller family owns sixty billion dollars in assets. The Rockefeller family invests a large portion of its capital in the arms industry. It has not only placed its own people in the American national institutions that directly lead the production of atomic weapons, but also in important positions in atomic research centers and the army, where important positions hold the decision-making power to continuously deliver armaments to the American army. In addition to the Rockefeller family, other American billionaire families such as Morgan and DuPont are also involved in the production of such destructive weapons.

The commentary said that for people like Rockefeller, the easing of international tensions would first and foremost mean a sharp decline in their profits. This is the reason why Rockefeller and others are advocating for the resumption of atomic bomb testing. This is the reason why they are single-mindedly advocating for the Cold War and doing everything possible to prevent the improvement of East-West relations.

    美国亿万富翁害怕国际局势缓和
    新华社布拉格4日电　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”4日刊载一篇题为“他们为谁说话？”的评论，揭露美国冷战鼓吹者的真面目。
    评论说：在日益众多的世界公众发出要求加强和平的呼声的时候，仍然可以听到那些有自己的“纲领”的冷战鼓吹者的叫嚣。其中之一就是纽约州长、亿万富翁洛克菲勒。洛克菲勒家族拥有六百亿美元财产。洛克菲勒家族把自己的资本很大一部分投在军火工业中，它不仅在直接领导原子武器生产的美国国家机构中安插了自己的人，而且在原子研究中心和陆军的重要岗位上也安插了人，而陆军中的重要岗位是操着把军火源源送交给美国陆军的决定大权的。除了洛克菲勒家族以外，其他美国亿万富豪家族如摩根、杜邦等也参与生产这种毁灭性武器。
    评论说，对洛克菲勒这些人来说，国际紧张局势的缓和就首先意味着他们利润的大大下降。这就是洛克菲勒等人力主恢复原子弹试验的原因。这就是他们一味鼓吹冷战，千方百计地阻止东西方关系改善的原由。
