    Hero Overcomes Death
    Soviet World Women's Parachuting Champion Recovers from Accident

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th - According to Soviet newspapers: Nadia Pryashina, the world women's individual parachuting champion and Soviet athlete, recently had an accident during a parachute jump, but she overcame death with bravery, composure, perseverance, and great skill. Recently, she has recovered her health, been discharged from the hospital, and has expressed her intention to continue participating in parachuting.

    Pryashina was the 1958 world women's individual parachuting champion. In the past eight years, she has won twenty gold medals. She carefully prepares for each jump and has never had an accident.

    On September 3, 1959, when she was performing her 938th jump from a height of 1,750 meters, she encountered an extremely rare situation: as a result of strong air currents, the parachute failed to open, and the reserve parachute could not be opened because it was entangled with the main parachute. At this time, without a parachute, her body was falling at a speed of twenty meters per second (four times the speed of descent with a parachute). Pryashina endured a severe test during the forty-five seconds of descent. She tried every means and controlled her direction. Even at the critical moment when she was about to hit the ground, she remained calm, held the parachute rope tightly, and tried her best to lift her body upwards, which greatly reduced the force of the impact when she hit the ground, landing in a soft field next to the airport, severely injuring her lumbar spine. However, precisely because of this, she snatched her life from the hands of death.

    In the history of world parachuting, it is unprecedented for someone like Pryashina to fall from such a height and not lose their life.

    英雄战胜了死亡
    苏联世界女子跳伞冠军失事受伤已恢复健康
    新华社莫斯科17日电　据苏联报纸报道：世界女子跳伞个人冠军、苏联运动员娜佳·普里亚希娜不久前在一次跳伞中发生意外，但她却以勇敢、镇静、毅力和高度技巧战胜了死亡。最近，她已经恢复健康，出了医院，并且表示将继续参加跳伞运动。
    普里亚希娜是1958年世界女子跳伞个人冠军。在过去八年中，她前后获得过二十枚金质奖章。她在每次跳伞前都仔细地做好准备工作，从未出过意外。
    1959年9月3日，当她从一千七百五十米高空进行她的第九百三十八次跳伞时，碰到了极偶然的情况：由于强大的气流冲击的结果，降落伞没有能张开，保险伞也因同主伞缠在一起而无法张开。这时，由于没有降落伞，她的身体以每秒钟二十米的速度（为有降落伞下降速度的四倍）下降着。普里亚希娜在下降的四十五秒钟内，经受了严重的考验。她想尽了各种办法并且控制着方向，就是在快要撞上地面的千钧一发的时刻，她仍然保持着冷静的头脑，紧握着跳伞的绳索尽力使自己的身子往上提，结果大大地减弱了撞在地面时的力量，摔在机场旁边松软的田野里，腰部脊椎受到重伤。但是，正由于这样，她从死神手里夺得了生命。
    在世界跳伞史上，像普里亚希娜这样从高空摔下而没有丧失生命是从未有过的。
