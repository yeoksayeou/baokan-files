Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 11th: Li Chuanjiang's oil extraction workshop at the Siping Oil and Wine Factory, a national pacesetter in the oil industry, has once again achieved an all-around leap forward in the first ten days of this year. The workshop's oil production in the first ten days of January this year increased by 56.25% compared to the last ten days of December 1959. The residual oil rate of soybean meal decreased from 1.2% to 1.06%, and the quality of soybean oil all reached the first-class standard.
    In order to ensure that production is "red every ten days, every month, and every quarter" in 1960, the workshop's employees launched a vigorous upsurge in technical innovation and technical revolution at the beginning of the year. They changed the manual leaching tanks to automatic clutch disengagement, achieving non-stop operation and greatly improving production efficiency. They also built a superheated steam furnace, reducing the evaporation and oil extraction time of the leaching tank from forty minutes to thirty minutes.
    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 11th: The Zhang Huaji group of the Jilin Provincial Agricultural Machinery Factory, which attended the National Congress of Heroes, achieved a flying start as soon as 1960 began. On the 3rd, the first working day, they completed twelve and a half days' worth of work. By the 9th, they had completed two and a half months' worth of work in only seven working days.
    In the first ten days of January, the Zhang Huaji group received the production tasks of twenty-seven components of five major products, including a new type of universal pulverizer, a 7.5-horsepower hammer crusher, and a mobile grain dryer. According to the workload calculation, it would take two months and fifteen days to complete. The Zhang Huaji group did not shrink back in the face of such arduous tasks. They were full of confidence and worked hard, and launched a major technical revolution around the key to production. In seven days, they successively improved four kinds of tooling and operating methods, greatly improving production efficiency and ensuring the overfulfillment of production tasks. When making the keys for the new type of universal pulverizer, they originally used an electric hammer, which resulted in poor quality and low efficiency, requiring thirty minutes to produce one component. After switching to using key tooling and a rivet machine, not only was the quality guaranteed, but the efficiency was increased by 59 times. They also implemented a fast operating method of quick-eyed, quick-handed continuous pressing according to the size of the components.
    Now, this group is further improving tools and doing a good job in material preparation to ensure a red start after the Spring Festival.

    李川江制油车间头一旬生产满堂红
    张化吉小组七天干了两个半月的活
    新华社长春11日电　全国油脂工业的旗帜——李川江领导的四平油酒厂制油车间，今年第一旬又赢得全面跃进。这个车间今年元月上旬的油脂产量，比1959年12月下旬增长了56．25％，豆粕残油率由1．2％降低到1．06％，豆油质量都达到了一级标准。
    这个车间的职工为了确保1960年生产旬旬红、月月红、季季红，今年一开始就掀起了大搞技术革新和技术革命的热潮。他们把手工操作的浸出罐改为自动摘离合器，做到了不停车，大大提高了生产效率。他们还修建了过热蒸汽炉，使浸出罐的蒸发走油时间由四十分钟缩短到三十分钟。
    新华社长春11日电　出席全国群英会的吉林省农业机械厂张化吉小组，1960年一开门就实现了满堂红。他们在3日第一个工作日就完成了十二天半的工作量；到9日止，只用七个工作日就完成了两个半月的工作量。
    张化吉小组在1月上旬，共接受了新型万能粉碎机、七点五马力锤式击碎机、移动式谷物烘干机等五种主要产品的二十七种部件的生产任务。按照工作量计算，需要做两个月零十五天才能完成。张化吉小组在这样艰巨的任务面前一点也没有畏缩。他们信心百倍，大鼓干劲，并且围绕生产关键展开了技术大革新。在七天之内，他们先后改进了四种工胎具和操作方法，生产效率大大提高，保证了生产任务的超额完成。在做新型万能粉碎机键子的时候，原来利用电锤打型，质量不好，效率低，每生产一个部件需要三十分钟；改用键子胎具和铆钉机压型之后，不仅保证了质量，而且提高效率五十九倍。他们还根据部件的大小，实行眼快、手快连续压型的快速操作方法。
    现在，这个小组正在进一步改进工具，做好材料准备工作，保证春节以后开门红。
