Commercial Employees Carry Out Major Innovations
Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Guangxi Create and Promote Large Numbers of New Tools

    (By our staff reporter) Commercial technology innovation work in the five provinces of Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Guangxi has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics from Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei, the number of inventions and imitations by employees has reached more than 9,590, and the number of items promoted has reached more than 400,000. Many heavy manual labor and complex manual operations in many industries have begun to be replaced by new tools and machinery.
    In the past year, the development of commercial technology innovation in the five provinces has mainly been reflected in the increasingly rich content of innovation and the wider scope of promotion; some new tools have begun to evolve from indigenous to foreign, from crude to refined; some industries have developed the use of new tools and equipment to form a continuous operation. For example, in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, advanced tools and machinery are mostly used in the links of acceptance, weighing, settlement, packaging, transportation, preliminary processing, loading, unloading, and stacking. Purchasing stations and warehouses (including live pig warehouses) in Foshan, Hengyang, Anlu, Pingxiang, and other counties and cities have promoted platform scales and sky scales. In the past, the purchase of live pigs involved tying and weighing each pig individually, but now, groups of pigs are driven into the scales for weighing together. The pigs are not startled, the people are not tired, and it is accurate and fast. Various indigenous and foreign serrated cotton gins, double-wheeled hemp strippers, acorn shellers, and various cotton stalk pressing tools promoted in Jiangxi have been basically used in the province's key cotton and hemp producing areas. The province has promoted more than 300 animal-powered stalk pressing machines alone, each of which can press more than 8,000 catties of cotton stalks per day, equivalent to the efficiency of 50 people pressing stalks by hand.
    Large warehouses in most cities and counties in the five provinces have promoted electric cranes, conveyors, loading, unloading, and stacking machines, and some small and medium-sized warehouses in counties and cities have also promoted many indigenous machines, indigenous and foreign hand-cranked, foot-pedaled, and other lifting and stacking tools. Some have set up aerial slides and underground rails according to local conditions, replacing the most laborious carrying, lifting, and picking work with pushing, pedaling, sliding, and cranking. Larger live pig warehouses in Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Guangxi have all realized the automation of pig feeding water and the mechanization of feed crushing. After the automation of pig feeding water was implemented in the Hengyang and Changsha live pig warehouses, one person could feed 1,200 pigs, an increase from 150 pigs.
    In the catering service industry, tools and machinery are also more commonly used in the links of rice washing, vegetable cutting, dough mixing, dishwashing, and food delivery. Steam stoves and indigenous universal stoves are more widely promoted in Guangdong.
    The extensive washing, dyeing, photography, bathhouse, and repair industries have promoted many new tools. In Foshan, the promotion of electric washing machines and electric dryers has greatly facilitated customers. Two washing machines can wash 2,400 pieces of clothing a day, equivalent to the labor of 48 people a day, shortening the delivery time from ten and a half months to three days.
    In large and medium-sized local specialty and food processing plants, new tools and machinery are mostly used in various main links such as crushing, washing, planing, cutting, mixing, dough making, manufacturing, pitting, and peeling. Due to the continuous production of various processes, the output value of the Guangzhou Agricultural and Sideline Products Processing Plant this year has doubled compared with last year, the number of personnel has decreased by more than 100, and the annual processing task has been completed 30 days ahead of schedule. Due to the large-scale technological innovation, the 14 processing plants in Shantou, including slaughtering, flour, salted groceries, and waste product processing plants, have achieved semi-mechanization and entered 1960 seventy days ahead of schedule.
    In terms of commodity retail, the promotion of measuring, pricing, inventory, packaging, and display tools has improved work efficiency. The retail department of Shantou City promoted the experience of "selling cloth as ready-made clothing," which made batching and cutting of cotton cloth save 10%—15% of cloth, while facilitating the masses. The city cut 43,200 pieces of semi-finished clothing in four months, and more than 39,000 pieces have been sold, saving a total of more than 35,800 city feet of cotton cloth.
    The employees of the vast rural commercial system also actively support the people's communes in carrying out tool reforms and support the development of farmland water conservancy construction and diversified operations. Over the past year, the Pingxiang County Commercial Bureau of Jiangxi Province has created 48 kinds of tools such as threshers and deep plows, and promoted more than 48,000 pieces in the county, realizing mechanization of wind, water, and electric threshing, saving more than 200,000 labor forces for the county's early rice harvest. At the same time, it has also successfully trial-produced various indigenous fertilizers, indigenous pesticides, indigenous cement, and several chemical products, helping communes and teams establish fertilizer plants, making the production of calcium acetate in chemical raw materials popular to all charcoal kilns in the county, and it is expected that the annual output of calcium acetate can reach about 10 million catties. The commercial staff of Anlu County, Hubei Province, assisted the commune in creating and improving more than 690 kinds of agricultural tools, and promoted more than 56,000 pieces, of which deep plows have been popularized to all production teams in the county, and the land in the county has basically reached deep plowing, ensuring a bumper harvest in agriculture.
    While carrying out technological innovation, a "large-scale military training in operating skills" movement was also launched. In the "military training" movement, new and old employees taught each other, learned together, and improved together, and thousands of pacesetters and experts emerged.

    商业职工大搞革新
    广东、湖南、江西、湖北、广西创造和推广大批新工具
    本报讯　广东、湖南、江西、湖北、广西五个省区的商业技术革新工作，取得了很大的成绩。据广东、湖南、江西、湖北四个省的不完全统计，职工的创造发明和学习仿制的项目已达九千五百九十多种，推广的件数达四十多万件。许多行业的一些笨重的体力劳动和复杂的手工操作，已经开始被新工具和机械代替了。
    一年来五个省区的商业技术革新的发展，主要表现在革新内容越来越丰富，推广的面越来越广；一部分新工具开始由土到洋，由粗到精；一部分行业在新工具和新设备的使用上已经发展到连成一片，实现了成套成器的连续作业。如在农副产品采购方面，验收、过秤、结算、打包、调运、初制加工和装卸、码垛等环节，大部分使用了先进工具和机械。佛山、衡阳、安陆、萍乡等县市的采购站和仓库（包括生猪仓库），都推广了地磅和天磅，过去收购生猪是逐个捆绑、逐个过秤，现在是把成群的猪赶到磅里一起过磅，猪不惊，人不累，又准、又快。江西推广的各种土洋结合的锯齿轧花机、双轮剥麻机、橡子脱壳机和各种压棉秆工具，在全省重点产棉麻地区已经基本上使用起来。仅畜力压秆机全省就推广三百多部，每部每天可压棉秆八千多斤，相当于五十个人手工压秆的效率。
    五个省区大部分市县的大型仓库都推广了电动起重机、输送机、装卸码垛机，一部分县市的中小型仓库也推广了不少土机械、土洋结合的手摇、脚踏等各种起重上下码垛等工具；有的根据地区条件设立了空中滑道，地下轨道，使过去最费力气的背、扛、抬、挑工作，用推、踏、滑、摇代替了。广东、湖南、江西、湖北、广西等较大的生猪仓库，都实现了喂猪用水自流化，饲料粉碎机械化。衡阳、长沙的生猪仓库实行了喂猪用水自流化以后，由一个人喂猪一百五十头，提高到一千二百头。
    饮食服务业中，淘米、切菜、和面、洗刷和饭菜传送等环节，也较为普遍地使用了工具和机械。蒸汽炉、土万能灶，在广东推广的较多。
    广大的洗染、照像、浴池和修理行业推广了很多新的工具。佛山市推广了电动洗衣机和电干机以后，给顾客很大方便。两部洗衣机，一天可洗二千四百件，等于四十八个人一天的劳动量，把交货期限由十天半月一跃而缩短到三天。
    在大中型的土特产品和食品加工厂中，粉碎、洗涤、刨切、搅拌、和面、制做、去核、刮皮等各种主要环节，也大部分使用了新工具和机械。广州市农副产品加工厂由于各个工序实现了连续化生产，今年的产值比去年增加一倍，人员比过去减少一百多，还提前三十天完成了全年加工任务。汕头市屠宰、面粉、咸杂、废品加工等十四个加工厂，由于大搞技术革新，实现了半机械化，提前七十天跨进了1960年。
    商品零售方面推广了计量、计价、盘点、包装和陈列等工具，工作效率有了提高。汕头市零售部门推广了“卖布成衣化”的经验，使棉布加工成批排料裁剪，节省了10％—15％的用布，同时方便了群众。全市四个月共裁剪半成品服装四万三千二百件，已售出三万九千多件，共节约棉布三万五千八百多市尺。
    广大农村商业系统的职工还积极支持人民公社大搞工具改革，支持农田水利建设和多种经营的发展。江西萍乡县商业局一年来创造打谷机、深耕犁等各种工具四十八项，在全县推广四万八千多件，实现了风力、水力、电力打谷机械化，使全县早稻收割节省劳动力二十多万个。同时还试制成功各种土化肥、土农药、土水泥和若干种化工产品，帮助公社队队建立了化肥厂，使化工原料中的醋酸钙的生产普及到全县所有木炭窑，预计年产醋酸钙可达一千万斤左右。湖北安陆县商业职工协助公社创造改进农具六百九十多项，推广的件数达五万六千多件，其中深耕犁已普及到全县各生产小队，全县土地基本上达到深耕，保证了农业丰收。
    在技术革新的同时，还开展了“操作技术大练兵”运动。“练兵”运动中，新老职工互教互学，共同提高，出现了成千上万的标兵和能手。
