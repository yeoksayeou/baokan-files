    Black God of Wealth (Crosstalk)
    Lu Qichang
    A: People have to eat.
    B: Nonsense!
    A: Eating is a principle, but everyone has different preferences.
    B: That's true.
    A: Some like fragrant food, some like dirty food.
    B: What? Can you eat dirty things?
    A: What do you think?
    B: I like fragrant food, not dirty food.
    A: What's the most fragrant thing?
    B: Pork is the most fragrant.
    A: Only pork is fragrant? Isn't lard fragrant?
    B: It's fragrant too.
    A: Pig liver?
    B: Fragrant.
    A: Pig kidney?
    B: Fragrant.
    A: Pig stomach?
    B: Fragrant.
    A: Pig manure?
    B: Hey, you can't eat that stuff.
    A: People don't eat it, but some things eat it.
    B: How novel!
    A: It's not that novel, crops eat it. You haven't heard that fertilizer is the food of crops. People want to eat fragrant things, but the land can't be separated from dirty things.
    B: Look how far you've gone around in circles. Just say that the farmland needs to be fertilized and it's done.
    A: Take pig manure, it contains various nutrients for crops, with a large amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, it is the best fertilizer.
    B: What is nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium?
    A: Don't you understand? These are chemical terms, the nutrients needed by crops, just like the nutrients needed by people! Understand?
    B: That's more like it.
    A: That's why a pig is a small fertilizer factory. Take our commune, last year we accumulated more than eight million catties of fertilizer, applied to more than three thousand mu of land, and each mu yielded an average of more than one hundred and twenty catties of grain. Pig manure has contributed to this.
    B: Hey, even though pig manure is dirty, the grain it grows is fragrant.
    A: Therefore, the Party calls on us to raise more pigs, first of all to accumulate more fertilizer and greatly increase grain production. My family alone raises so many pigs. (Uses hand to gesture numbers)
    B: ?, eighteen?
    A: No, move the decimal point.
    B: One hundred and eighty?
    A: Move the decimal point again.
    B: One thousand eight hundred?
    A: Almost.
    B: Your family raises all of them?
    A: Our production team raises all of them.
    B: You scared me.
    A: On average, more than one per person. These pigs are simply full of treasures. Manure is farmyard manure, bones can be made into bone fertilizer, not to mention; and pigs can also be turned into steel and machines.
    B: Never heard of that.
    A: You don't believe it? Let me tell you, six live pigs can be exchanged for one ton of steel, and more than six hundred pigskins can be exchanged for a tractor; pig bristles and casings can also be exchanged for machines.
    B: Hey, your team's pigskins alone can be exchanged for three tractors. Doesn't that accelerate the realization of mechanization?
    A: Furthermore: pig bristles can be made into brushes. Pig organs can extract more than fifty kinds of industrial raw materials and medicines. Blood powder made from pig blood is indispensable for paint. If you suffer from anemia and want to get liver extract injections, the raw materials must also be taken from the pig.
    B: The use is really not small.
    A: Since the pig has a body of treasures, it should be listed as the head of the six domestic animals. When I think about it, raising pigs is so important and makes such a great contribution to socialist construction, I am very excited, so I signed up to be a breeder and joined the pig-raising work in our team's breeding farm.
    B: Promising.
    A: On New Year's Day, I specially wrote a couplet at the entrance of the pigsty.
    B: The first line?
    A: The first line is: Pigs, sheep, cattle, chickens, ducks, rabbits, the six domestic animals are prosperous and I am the head;
    B: Who is "I"?
    A: The pigsty is the pig's home, "I" is of course the pig.
    B: Not bad! What about the second line?
    A: The second line is: Wheat, sorghum, rice, cotton, oil, hemp, the five grains are abundant and manure comes first.
    B: What about the horizontal scroll?
    A: Mansion of the Black God of Wealth.
