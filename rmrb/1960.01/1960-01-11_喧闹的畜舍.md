    The Noisy Livestock Shed
    Li Canhuang

    Deep is the night, deep is the night, the crescent moon hangs curved on the treetops. From the livestock shed of the Jiangnan Commune, a burst of noise erupts. It awakens the old grandfather of the eastern family, startles the little baby of the western family. The old commune leader throws on his clothes and rushes outside, each step accompanied by a racing heart. Could it be that the sheep are sick? Could it be that the horses have broken free? What on earth has happened? Is it a blessing or a curse, making people anxious!

    From the livestock shed, singing rises high, on the doors and windows, lamplight flickers. The old commune leader leaps through the door – the cows are bellowing, the horses are neighing, the sheep are bleating! Why are the horses so delighted that their tails are up? Why are the sheep so happy they are jumping? The caretaker reports the good news to the commune leader, “The Yorkshire” has given birth to sons! Eighteen were born in one litter, each one fat, each one good. The caretaker girls are like nannies, holding the newborn piglets in their arms!

    Heart, oh heart, don’t beat so fast. Tears, oh tears, don’t fall so thickly. The old commune leader takes a piglet and refuses to let go, kissing it again and again, holding it again and again!

    The land is good because of the commune! The pigs are treasures of the commune! The songs of the commune are the loudest, sing a joyous song to report the good news!

    Good news! Good news!! Good news!!! The commune's sow has earned a bumper production title. One person tells ten, ten tell a hundred, the crowds have flooded the livestock shed!

    Deep is the night, deep is the night, the crescent moon hangs curved on the treetops. The old commune leader gives a shout, to build a new livestock shed overnight...!
