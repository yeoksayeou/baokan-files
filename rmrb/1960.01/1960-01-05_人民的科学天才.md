    The People's Scientific Genius
    By Soviet writer O. Pisarzhevsky

    Wherever Soviet people work, they say: "Science is our first assistant." This is true, and in any field of human activity, we can easily prove how correct this statement is.

    In 1959, people of all countries received particularly abundant evidence of the powerful force of the intelligentsia. These good news came from the homeland of the greatest scientific achievements of modern times – the Soviet Union. These facts shook many people in capitalist countries like a bolt from the blue. However, anyone who observes with goodwill how the first country to achieve socialist victory has developed and the characteristics of this development cannot but admit that the Soviet Union must be at the forefront of scientific achievements, and no other conclusion is possible.

    What are these achievements?

    Following the first artificial Earth satellites, new cosmic rockets have embarked on distant journeys – interstellar space – one after another. One of them opened the road to the moon and became the new, tenth planet of our solar system. Then another flew out, landed on the moon, and left physical evidence of its meritorious service on the lunar surface: the national emblem of the launching country. This paean of creative intelligence coincided with the solemn mission of peace undertaken by Khrushchev, head of the Soviet government, during his visit to the United States.

    Listen, a new triumphal song was played not long ago! The flight laboratory launched by the Soviets bypassed the moon and photographed the mysterious and hitherto unseen far side of the moon. To create such a miracle, many scientific talents and arts must be concentrated.

    And a little earlier, the world was swept by the news: the dream of the heroic people who conquered the frozen Arctic Ocean had come true. The nuclear-powered icebreaker "Lenin" began its first voyage from the port of Leningrad. Ordinary icebreakers that use coal as fuel can sail for a maximum of twenty days without docking, while the "Lenin" can sail for more than twelve months! The "nuclear fuel" consumed by the "Lenin" nuclear-powered icebreaker per day is not calculated in tons or even kilograms, but only a few tens of centimeters. If coal were used as fuel, such an icebreaker would use 300,000 tons a year…

    Whether it is a rocket carrying a cosmic laboratory into planetary orbit or the operation of a nuclear reactor, it is operated by precise automated devices.

    Not long ago, similar machines brilliantly drove locomotives in experiments on a Soviet railway. Other types of these machines are helping steelworkers operate powerful blast furnaces. Automation is controlling the power distribution of power stations and vast power grids. Fast computers solve complex mathematical problems posed by meteorologists or creators of new giant aircraft.

    Of course, these are just a few examples of the amazing achievements of Soviet science. As everyone knows, many of them are beyond the reach of even the most developed capitalist countries.

    But how did the Soviet state achieve such amazing achievements?

    One of our foreign friends successfully expressed the main essence of these achievements with a very simple comment.

    He said: "We don't know the composition of the fuel that propels the lunar rocket forward. Well, let it be a secret! But I know the most important fuel. Its name is socialism!"

    Indeed, this victory of Soviet science, like many of its other achievements, was nurtured by the development of Soviet society and the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet state.

    First of all, it should be pointed out that socialist society itself was born as a result of the revolutionary struggle of the masses of the people, led by the working class, against capitalism. The Communist Party, armed with the most advanced scientific theory – Marxism-Leninism – led the people's struggle. The realization of the ideas and conclusions of this advanced scientific theory is the most important condition for the victory of the proletarian revolution and the building of a socialist society in the country. In its future development, Soviet society continues to follow this advanced, Marxist-Leninist scientific theory.

    The ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the dialectical method of understanding are the reliable basis for all scientific research. Dialectical and historical materialism objectively observes nature and society and regards them as constantly changing and developing. The Marxist-Leninist methodology provides the possibility of drawing objectively correct conclusions from new data obtained from the results of research experiments. Marxist-Leninist philosophy differs from bourgeois philosophical schools in that it is true science because it reflects the laws of the objective world. It generally embodies the fundamental interests of the masses of the people and the urgent requirements of social progress and development. Therefore, Marxist-Leninist philosophy promotes the development of science.

    Since the day of the Great October Socialist Revolution, when the people took power into their own hands, science has been included in creative work. Because the problem was precisely to transform a vast country covering more than 22 million square kilometers, occupying half of Europe and one-third of Asia, on the basis of science. It was necessary to change the entire economy of this country in a very short period of time, greatly expand the mining of mineral deposits, and establish large steel, machine-building, and chemical factories to lay the foundation for further industrialization. This was a matter of life and death.

    And all this had to be started under conditions of blockade, hunger, and destruction. In addition, the primitive industry of pre-revolutionary Russia had been destroyed by the war. However, outstanding scientists in pre-revolutionary Russia who could not fully contribute their knowledge expressed their determination to work with the Soviet government in accordance with the government's tasks. There were very few of them because in old Russia, science was almost entirely concentrated in nine universities and a few higher vocational schools, and scientific research was carried out on the initiative of individual scientists.

    During the period of national industrialization and in the first few five-year plan periods, the main energy of scientists was concentrated on the task of catching up with advanced capitalist countries. Therefore, well-known technological procedures, instruments, machines, and the scientific and technological achievements of others were adopted worldwide. But it doesn't stop there!

    It is not easy to catch up by simply following in "other people's footsteps" without opening up one's own new paths, and it is even more impossible to surpass them. Young Soviet science has achieved unique achievements from the very beginning. For example, a new synthetic rubber industry was established in the early 1930s. Soviet chemists achieved this so suddenly that the West at that time did not believe it.

    However, major scientific achievements never come out of thin air. Every "leap forward" is the result of long-term painstaking preparation and daily effort. The history of the achievements of Soviet scientists in the construction of giant power stations, high-voltage transmission lines, the application of atomic energy, and many other aspects is the same. This illustrates the special circumstances of science in socialist society. The Soviet people believe that the development of science is a cause closely related to their own flesh and blood because every scientific achievement is directly used to benefit the people.

    Not only that, but the people themselves are participating in the development of science. We are not talking about "the people's scientific genius" in vain. Socialism has liberated the labor of hundreds of millions of workers in factories and fields, opened up the path for them to receive higher education, and created particularly favorable conditions for the development of the talents inherent in the people. The Soviet Union now ranks first in the world in terms of the scale of training new scientific and technical personnel. There are now more than two million students in the Soviet Union studying in 767 universities and colleges; more than three and a half million students are studying in technical schools and other secondary specialized schools.

    Higher and secondary education in the Soviet Union is free. Most college students receive state scholarships; in addition, most college students also receive wages during production internships. More than 50% of college students enjoy state dormitories, and every talented and knowledgeable young person can study in college. This is the reason why the reserve force of young scientific personnel in the Soviet Union is so strong.

    In the second year of the Seven-Year Plan, the work of training specialists with higher and secondary specialized education will be greatly expanded and improved, and the number of engineers trained in 1960 will reach 119,000. This is two and a half times more than the number of engineers trained in the United States in 1958.

    Higher education is now much closer to production. People who work in factories and collective farms, and those who are willing to receive higher education without leaving their main job, enjoy great preferential treatment. This is particularly important because production has now reached such a complex level that it can only be advanced with the help of advanced scientific methods. Innovators and advanced workers in production master these scientific methods while being educated and apply them to their workshop production. This is how the scientific front is constantly expanding. At the All-Union Congress of Inventors and Rationalization Proponents not long ago, inspiring figures of saving tens of billions of rubles were cited, which was due to the implementation of the wise, scientifically based suggestions of innovators.

    The favorable conditions provided by socialism for the development of science are also manifested in the fact that scientific work has long-term planning in socialist society, and scientists receive the funds necessary for their work from the state. According to the overall plan for national economic development, even theoretical research work that cannot provide any direct benefits in the short term is funded. However, such research work is equally necessary for science, just as eagles need to fly high so that they can look far ahead and discover prey. And the funds for the development of science are not a small amount! For example, some scientific instruments used to reveal the secrets of atomic structure are huge engineering buildings. For example, the most magnificent machine such as the synchronous phase accelerator, some parts of this building, such as magnets, weigh dozens of tons… But the Soviet state, whose industry has reached a high level, can allocate funds without restrictions for scientific work that is recognized as particularly important. The results of this true revolutionary development achieved in scientific work are particularly huge. These results cannot be measured solely by material investment.

    Only under the conditions of the Soviet state is it possible to establish collective scientific research organizations. Each member of such an organization has the opportunity to complete and solve research work and tasks that he could not do alone.

    But that's not all. Scientific work is creation. When a scientist sees that he can realize his greatest ideals, his enthusiasm will be high, so that he can complete the task ahead of all the original deadlines. The great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism has consolidated this vigorous enthusiasm of scientists. The Marxist-Leninist doctrine armed scientists with the belief that scientific knowledge has no end.

    In the Soviet Union, the foundation on which science develops and prospers has been greatly expanded. Millions of production innovators, worker inventors, and rationalization proponents are promoting the progress of technical science.

    When the Soviet state entered the decisive stage of peaceful economic competition with capitalism, science played an extremely important role. When passing the Seven-Year Plan for developing the national economy, the Soviet Union announced to the world that it would increase total industrial output by 80% in seven years, increase electricity production by more than double, increase chemical industry production by two times, and increase the actual income of workers and farmers by 40%. Solving the basic economic tasks of the Soviet Union and the grand prospects for domestic communist construction have issued a call to all Soviet scientific and technical workers to advance towards establishing new meritorious services.

    This is why the science of the socialist world is beginning to surpass the science of capitalist society in a regular and unstoppable way. The wings of this eagle are becoming increasingly full and unfolded. Soviet scientists are enthusiastically revisiting the brilliant prophecy of the great Lenin: "…All the wonders of technology and all the achievements of culture will become the wealth of the whole people, and from then on the wisdom and genius of mankind will never become a means of violence or a means of exploitation. We understand this, is it not worth working for this greatest historical task, is it not worth contributing all our strength?"

    人民的科学天才
    苏联作家　奥·皮沙尔热夫斯基
    苏维埃人无论在哪里工作，他们都说：“科学是我们的第一助手。”事实如此，不论在人类活动的哪一个领域，我们都可以毫不费力地证明，这种说法是多么的正确。
    1959年，各国人民得到了特别多的证据，说明知识界的强大威力。这些好消息来自现代最伟大的科学成就的祖国——苏联。这些事实像晴天霹雳一样震动了资本主义国家的许多人。但是，任何人只要他心怀善意地注意观察到，第一个取得了社会主义胜利的国家是如何发展起来的，以及这一发展的特点如何，他就不能不承认苏联必然应居科学成就的首位，此外不可能再有别的结论。
    这些成就是什么呢？
    紧跟着第一批地球人造卫星之后，新的宇宙火箭一个接着一个地登上了遥远的征途——星际空间。其中一只开辟了通向月球的道路，并且成了我们太阳系的新的、第十个行星。随后又飞出了另一只，它在月球上靠了岸，并且在月球的表面上留下了树立功勋的实物证据：发射国的国徽标记。这支创造性智慧的凯歌和苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫在访问美国期间担负的重大和平使命的序曲恰好合上拍节。
    听，就在不久前奏起了新的凯旋曲！苏维埃人发射的飞行实验室绕过了月球，拍下了我们从来看不到的、奥妙莫测的月球背面。为了建树这样的奇迹，必须集中起许多科学的才智和艺术。
    而在稍早一些时候，全世界传遍了一则消息：征服冰封的极地海洋的英勇的人们的幻想实现了。“列宁”号原子破冰船从列宁格勒的港口开始了第一次航行。普通的破冰船用煤作燃料不靠港顶多航行二十昼夜，而“列宁”号破冰船却可以航行十二个多月！“列宁”号原子破冰船每昼夜消耗的“核燃料”不以吨甚至不以公斤来计算，而总共也不过几十公分而已。要是用煤作燃料，这样的破冰船航行一年将要用三十万吨……
    无论是发射携带宇宙实验室飞上行星轨道的火箭，或是原子反应堆的工作，都由精确的自动化装置操纵。
    不久以前，类似的机器在苏联一条铁道上的实验中，出色地驾驶了机车。其他类型的这种机器正在帮助钢铁工人操纵强大的高炉。自动化装置在控制着发电站和广大的输电网的电力分配工作。快速计算机解决着气象学家或新的巨型飞机的创造者提出来的复杂的数学难题。
    当然，这只不过是表明苏联科学所达到的惊人成就的个别例子。正如大家所知道的，其中许多甚至就是最发达的资本主义国家也是望尘莫及的。
    但是，究竟苏维埃国家怎么会达到如此惊人的成就的呢？
    我们的一位外国朋友以非常简单的评语成功地表达了这些成就的主要本质。
    他说：“我们不知道月球火箭赖以前进的燃料的成分。好啦，就让它是个秘密吧！然而我知道这个最主要的燃料。它的名字叫社会主义！”
    的确，苏维埃科学的这个胜利，正像它的许多其他的成就一样，是苏维埃社会的发展、共产党和苏维埃国家的政策所孕育出来的。
    首先应该指出，社会主义社会本身是由于以工人阶级为首的人民群众进行反对资本主义的革命斗争的结果而诞生的。以最先进的科学理论——马克思列宁主义武装起来的共产党领导了人民的斗争。实现这个先进科学理论的思想和结论，是无产阶级革命取得胜利和在国内建成社会主义社会的最重要的条件。苏维埃社会在自己今后的发展中仍继续遵循这个先进的、马克思列宁主义的科学理论。
    马克思列宁主义的思想、辩证的认识方法是一切科学研究的可靠基础。辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义客观地观察自然界和社会，并把它们看成是不断变化和发展着的。马克思列宁主义的方法论提供了从研究实验的结果而获得的新的资料中作出客观正确的结论的可能性。马克思列宁主义的哲学和资产阶级哲学流派不同之处在于，它是真正的科学，因为它反映出客观世界的规律。它概括地体现出人民群众的根本利益，社会进步发展的迫切要求。因此，马克思列宁主义的哲学在促进科学的发展。
    自从伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，人民把政权掌握在自己手里的那一天起，科学就列入了创造性的工作。因为问题正是要在科学的基础上改造占半个欧洲和三分之一亚洲、面积二千二百多万平方公里的幅员辽阔的国家。必须在很短的时期内改变这个国家的全部经济，大大扩大矿藏的开采量，建立大的钢铁、机器制造和化学工厂，以便为进一步工业化打下基础。这是生死攸关的问题。
    而这一切只得在封锁、饥饿和破坏的条件下开始。此外，革命前俄国的原始工业已被战争破坏殆尽。但是，在革命前俄国的不能充分献出自己的知识的优秀科学家表示了自己的决心，要同苏维埃政府一起根据政府的任务工作。他们的人数很少，因为在旧的俄国，科学几乎完全集中在九所大学和几所高等专科学校里，而且科学研究是靠科学家个人的主动性来进行的。
    在国家工业化时期，在最初几个五年计划时期，科学家的主要精力集中在赶上先进资本主义国家的任务上。因此采用了全世界都已熟知的工艺规程、仪器、机器和别人的科学和技术成就。但是，不止于此！
    仅仅踏着“别人的脚印”迈步前进而不开辟自己的新途径，这样赶上去是不容易的，而超过去更是不可能的。年轻的苏维埃科学，从最初就取得了独特的成就。例如，在三十年代初建立了新的合成橡胶工业。苏联化学家获得这个成就是这样的突然，以致西方当时都不相信。
    但是，重大的科学成就从来不是凭空而来的。每一次“跃进”都是长年累月的辛勤的准备和每日的努力的结果。苏联科学家在巨型电站、高压输电线的建设方面，在原子能的运用和其他许多方面取得的成就的历史就是如此。这说明了社会主义社会科学的特殊情况。苏联人民认为发展科学是与自己血肉相关的事业，因为每一项科学成就都直接用来为人民谋福利。
    不仅如此，人民自己就在参加科学的发展。我们并不是空谈“人民的科学天才”。社会主义解放了工厂和田野上亿万劳动者的劳动，为他们开辟了获得高等教育的通途并且为蕴藏在人民中的天才的发扬光大创造了特别良好的条件。就培养新的科学和技术干部的规模而言，苏联现在居世界第一位。苏联现在有二百多万名学生在七百六十七所高等学校里学习；有三百五十余万名的学生在技术学校和其他的中等专业学校学习。
    苏联的高等和中等教育是免费的。大多数大学生都得到国家助学金；此外，大多数大学生在进行生产实习时还得到工资。50％以上的大学生享用国家宿舍，每一个有才能和有知识的青年人都可以在高等学校学习。苏联青年科学干部的后备力量这样强大的原因，就在于此。
    七年计划的第二年，培养具有高等和中等专业教育程度的专家的工作将要大大地扩大和改善，1960年培养出的工程师将达到十一万九千人。这比1958年美国培养出的工程师多两倍半。
    高等教育现在大大接近生产。在工厂和集体农庄工作的人，以及愿意不脱离自己主要的工作接受高等教育的人，享受很大的优待。这是特别重要的，因为现在生产已达到这样复杂的程度，只有借助先进的科学方法才能把它推向前进。生产革新者、先进工人在受教育的同时，掌握这些科学方法并运用到自己的车间生产上去。科学的战线就是这样不断地在扩展。不久前在全苏发明家与合理化建议者代表大会上，举出了节约数百亿卢布的振奋人心的数字，这是由于革新者的智慧的、有科学根据的建议付诸实现而得来的。
    社会主义为科学发展提供了良好的条件还表现在：科学工作在社会主义社会里有长远的规划，科学家从国家那里得到自己工作所必需的经费。根据国民经济发展的总规划，甚至在短期内不能提供任何直接效益的理论研究工作也得到拨款。但是，这样的研究工作对于科学同样是需要的，就像鹰需要飞得高高地，以便能够高瞻远瞩发现猎取物一样。而供科学发展的经费却是一笔不小的数目啊！例如，一些用来揭示原子结构秘密的科学仪器就是庞大的工程建筑。譬如说，同步稳相加速器这样最壮丽宏伟的机器吧，这个建筑的个别部件，例如磁铁就重达数十吨……。但是，工业已达到了高度水平的苏维埃国家，有可能毫无限制地为公认为特别重要的科学工作拨付经费。科学工作所获得的这种真正的革命发展的成果是特别巨大的。这些成果根本不可能仅仅用物质投资来衡量。
    只有在苏维埃国家的条件下，才有可能成立集体科学研究组织。这种组织中的每个成员都有可能完成和解决他一个人单独进行时力所不及的研究工作和任务。
    但是，这还不是全部。科学工作，这是创造。当科学家看到他能够实现自己最大的理想的时候，他的热情就会高涨，以致能够超过原定的一切限期完成任务。马克思列宁主义的伟大学说巩固了科学家的这种奋发的热情。马克思列宁主义学说以科学认识没有止境的信念武装了科学家。
    在苏联，科学赖以发展和繁荣的基础无比地扩大了。数百万名生产革新者、工人发明家和合理化建议者在促进技术科学的进步。
    当苏维埃国家进入了同资本主义和平经济竞赛的决定性阶段的时期，科学起着极端重要的作用。在通过发展国民经济的七年计划时，苏联向全世界宣布，它将在七年内把工业总产值增加80％，电力生产增加一倍多，化学工业的生产增加两倍，工人和农民的实际收入增加40％。解决苏联基本经济任务和国内共产主义建设的宏伟前景，向苏维埃全体科学和技术工作者发出了向树立新的功勋挺进的号召。
    这就是社会主义世界的科学正在开始合乎规律地和不可遏止地超过资本主义社会科学的原因。这只雄鹰的羽翼正在日益丰满和展开。苏维埃科学家满腔热忱地重温伟大的列宁的英明的预言：“……技术的一切奇迹、文化的一切成果将成为全民的财富，而从此人类的智慧和天才将永远不会变成暴力的手段、剥削的手段。我们懂得这个，难道为了这个最伟大的历史任务不值得工作，不值得贡献一切力量吗？”
