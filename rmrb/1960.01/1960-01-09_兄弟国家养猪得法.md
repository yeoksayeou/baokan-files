Fraternal Countries' Effective Pig Raising Methods

Soviet Union's Three Pig Raising Experts
Creating Advanced Scientific Pig Raising Experience

Recently, three pig raisers in the Soviet Union were awarded prizes by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Yaroslav Chiti, a pig raiser from the "Shevchenko" Collective Farm in Lvov Oblast, sold 56,000 kilograms of pork to the state in eleven months last year and guaranteed to sell 100,000 kilograms of pork to the state in 1960 and 250,000 kilograms of pork in 1961. He lowered the labor consumption of pig raising below that of the United States. Last year, he reduced the labor consumption for producing every 100 kilograms of pork to 5.6 work hours, while the United States was 6.6 work hours. Chiti was originally a demobilized soldier, a Communist Party member, and a coal miner. In 1957, he returned to his hometown "Shevchenko" Collective Farm because the doctor did not allow him to continue working underground. When he discovered that the breeding and growth of pigs in the village were slow, the costs were high (100 kilograms of pork cost 1,000 rubles), and a lot of labor was spent, he asked to work in the pig farm. He took the time to read many books on pig raising methods, boldly innovated, and greatly improved the method of feeding pigs.

Peleshifuko, a pig raiser from the "Vanquisher" State Farm in Omsk Oblast, fattened 2,076 pigs in eleven months last year and delivered 197,200 kilograms of pork to the state. In mid-December, he delivered another 5,400 kilograms of pork.

Bartulis, a pig raiser from the "Katenieki" State Farm in the Latvian Republic, fattened 2,014 pigs last year and delivered 200,000 kilograms of pork to the state. He guaranteed to fatten 3,000 pigs in 1960 and sell at least 300,000 kilograms of pork to the state.

Their main advanced experiences are: (1) Raising pigs in large groups without pens, classifying (such as breeding sows, weaned piglets, etc.) and caring for them in stages (2-4 months, 4-6 months, over 6 months, etc.). (2) Mechanizing tasks such as watering and feeding, and feeding regularly and quantitatively. The pig raisers scientifically allocate their time and formulate a "life program" for breeding and management work. (3) Utilizing as much coarse feed as possible, combining refined and coarse feed, but mainly using inexpensive and juicy feed (various green fodder and corn silage, etc.). (4) Paying attention to the cleanliness and hygiene of the pigsty (cleaning twice a day) to prevent diseases.

Using Machines to Distribute Feed
A new-style pig farm has been established in the "Kuban" State Farm in Krasnodar Krai, Soviet Union. Most of the complex work processes in the farm are mechanized.

Balconies for Piglets
Members of the "Klimen" agricultural cooperative in Oranienburg district, German Democratic Republic, have improved their methods of raising livestock, reducing the mortality rate of piglets to 3%. One of the methods is to set up balconies in the pigsty for the piglets to move back and forth, which can protect the piglets from being squeezed by the sows and promote production.

Feeding Piglets Antibiotics
Scientists and technicians at the Livestock Breeding Institute of the Brno Agricultural Science Research Institute in Czechoslovakia have successfully experimented with many new methods to promote rapid growth of livestock.
The experiment of adding one milligram of antibiotics to the feed to increase the weight of piglets has been successful.

    兄弟国家养猪得法
    苏联三位养猪能手
    创造科学养猪先进经验
    最近苏联有三位养猪员荣获苏联最高苏维埃主席团授予的奖赏。里沃夫州“谢夫钦科”集体农庄养猪员雅罗斯洛夫·契季在去年十一个月之内向国家交售了五万六千公斤猪肉，并保证1960年向国家交售十万公斤猪肉，1961年交售二十五万公斤猪肉。他使养猪的劳动消耗低于美国。去年他把生产每一百公斤猪肉的劳动消耗降低到五点六工时，而美国是六点六工时。契季原是一个转业军人、共产党员、煤矿矿工，1957年因医生不允许他继续下井劳动才回到家乡“谢夫钦科”集体农庄。当他发现村庄猪的繁殖和成长很慢、成本很高（一百公斤猪肉成本达一千卢布）、劳动力花得很多的时候，就要求到养猪场工作。他抽空读了许多有关养猪方法的书籍，大胆革新，大大改善了喂猪方法。
    鄂木斯克州“胜利者”国营农场的养猪员佩列希符科去年十一个月内喂肥了二千零七十六头猪，交给了国家十九万七千二百公斤猪肉，12月中旬又交了五千四百多公斤猪肉。
    拉脱维亚共和国“卡捷尼叶基”国营农场养猪员巴尔图利斯去年喂肥了二千零一十四头猪，交给了国家二十万公斤猪肉。他保证1960年喂肥三千头猪，至少交售给国家三十万公斤猪肉。
    他们的主要先进经验是：（1）无栏大群饲养，分类（如繁殖用母猪、断奶小猪等）、分期照管（2—4个月、4—6个月、6个月以上等）。（2）给水喂料等工作机械化，定时、定量喂养。养猪员科学支配时间，制定一套饲养管理工作的“生活程序”。
  （3）尽量利用粗饲料，精粗搭配，但以廉价多汁饲料（各种青草饲料和玉蜀黍青贮饲料等）为主。（4）注意猪圈清洁卫生（一天打扫两次），防止病疫。
    用机器分饲料
    苏联克拉斯诺达尔边区“库班”国营农场建立了一个新式的养猪场。场里大部分复杂的工作过程都是机械化的。

    为小猪设阳台
    德意志民主共和国奥兰宁堡区“克里门”农业合作社的社员改进了饲养家畜的方法，使小猪的死亡率降低到3％。其中一个方法是在猪舍里设立了小猪可以来回走动的阳台，这样可使小猪免受母猪的挤压，并能促进生产。

    给小猪吃抗菌素
    捷克斯洛伐克布尔诺农业科学研究院牲畜饲养研究所的科学家和技术人员们试验成功了许多种促使牲畜很快地长肉的新方法。
    在饲料中加一毫克抗菌素使猪崽体重增加的实验获得了成功。
