Adenauer's "Cold War" Clamor
席林生

Recently, West Germany's "Cold War Knight," Adenauer, has been actively engaging in Cold War clamoring again. During his provocative "visit" to West Berlin, he openly advocated maintaining the occupation regime in West Berlin. There, he shouted that if an atomic war were to occur, "the Soviet Union would be utterly destroyed." He wants Western countries to abandon the results already achieved at last year's Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference and make it clear at future summit meetings that no changes to West Berlin's "legal status" will be allowed. In a televised speech, Adenauer reiterated the cliché that the West Berlin question cannot be resolved until the German question is resolved.

This notorious West German "Cold War Knight," in just the first dozen or so days of this year, has been constantly issuing such Cold War cries. In a Dutch newspaper, he wrote that West Germany should oppose the Soviet Union with "a firm will to contribute to the execution of defense." On his eighty-fourth birthday, he shouted again, "Without strength, there is no such thing as policy," and "Germany must be strong enough to recover lost territories." It seems Adenauer is unwilling to let go of any opportunity to poison the international atmosphere.

Over the past period, the development of the international situation has become increasingly favorable to peace and unfavorable to the imperialist Cold War policy; under the pressure of world public opinion, the United States has also had to express its willingness to hold an East-West summit meeting. Adenauer's public clamoring had once somewhat subsided. At the time, West German newspapers said he was superficially maintaining "silence" and "waiting" for an opportunity. Therefore, it is clearly no accident that Adenauer is now unwilling to remain "silent" and is frequently issuing Cold War cries. This is closely related to the recent attitude of the United States towards the summit meeting.

People remember that not long ago, American figures in power, Eisenhower and Herter, constantly expressed that the United States was willing to "resolve international disputes with the conference table rather than with force," and "willing to hold a summit meeting as soon as possible," hoping to bring "genuine hope for factors that would ease world tensions" through serious negotiations. Eisenhower's recent State of the Union address was even more pleasing to the ear: the United States is "committed to the cause of peace," and its "attitude towards the new opportunity" to hold a summit meeting "is extremely serious," and so on. Some Western news agencies even said that the United States had a great divergence of opinion with West Germany's rigid attitude. However, the Associated Press reported on January 12 on Washington's reaction to Adenauer's Cold War clamoring, which gave a completely different impression. It wrote: The U.S. attitude is that since no agreement was reached at the Geneva conference, "the summit meeting must start from scratch. This is consistent with Adenauer's attitude." In fact, this "agreement of attitude" between the United States and Adenauer did not appear suddenly.

As early as before U.S. President Eisenhower went abroad for a "peace and goodwill" visit, that is, when leading figures of the U.S. government constantly expressed that the United States was "striving for peace," Adenauer tried his best to postpone the summit meeting as much as possible. And some American newspapers were also clamoring that an East-West summit meeting was "the later, the better." At the time, Eisenhower, at a press conference, on the one hand, expressed his hope to hold the meeting "as soon as possible," and on the other hand, using the necessity of the West determining a common position as an excuse, agreed to De Gaulle's opinion of postponing the meeting. Agence France-Presse said that Eisenhower's speech "strengthened Adenauer's confidence."

Many Western news agencies also revealed that the Western countries' negotiations with the Soviet Union had always made the United States fear that it would promote the international situation to develop further in a direction unfavorable to imperialism and would relax the will of the Western camp. Not long ago, the report of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives on Western European policy pointed out: In Europe, "the increasing interest in negotiating with the Soviet Union is a heavy burden for us." Therefore, the U.S. government attempted to pour cold water on people's desire to negotiate with the Soviet Union. The U.S. Secretary of State deliberately spread the argument of doubting the Soviet Union, saying that whether the Soviet Union is prepared to hold serious negotiations "remains to be proven"; "the defensive strength of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance and further strengthening of this strength remains of fundamental importance." And Adenauer also tried his best to chime in, shouting, "We must not relax our vigilance," "So far, nothing has made us believe that the communist system is seriously intending to pursue a policy of understanding." Thus, another obstacle to holding an East-West summit meeting appeared. U.S. Secretary of State Herter said at the North Atlantic Group Council meeting last December: "Negotiations with the Soviet Union will be quite long-term." The U.S. "Star Evening News" frankly admitted that this was the West implementing "delaying diplomacy," "delaying the solution of important pending issues month after month, perhaps year after year." This is obviously completely to Adenauer's liking.

After the North Atlantic Group Council held its meeting, the West then convened a Western summit meeting attended by the heads of state of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany. At this meeting, Adenauer, under the instigation of the United States and other Western countries, behaved even more arrogantly. Adenauer demanded that the allies "prevent" changes in the status quo of Berlin; demanded that the progress of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference be abandoned, and that "any" re-discussion of the Berlin issue should begin with the so-called "phased plan." Sure enough, the final communique of the Western summit meeting, on the Berlin and German issues, "reaffirmed the principles stipulated in the Four-Power Communique of December 14, 1958, and the Declaration on Berlin of the North Atlantic Council of December 16, 1958." This was actually the West retreating to the "rigid position" of the previous year and agreeing to Adenauer's proposal. At the time, Western reporters pointed out that this was the Western countries picking up the long-broken "package plan" as the basis for negotiations with the Soviet Union, "which means that the attitude of the allies has become tough" (United Press International). After the meeting, West German government spokesman Eckardt said that Adenauer was "very satisfied" with this meeting.

Therefore, it is not difficult to see that Adenauer's current "Cold War" clamoring is encouraged and encouraged by the attitude of the United States towards the East-West summit meeting. It is not an exaggeration to regard Adenauer as the barometer of the United States for the summit meeting. Now there is news that Adenauer will go to Washington to meet with Eisenhower in the near future, "intending to prevent his allies from making any dangerous concessions in negotiations with the Russians." Therefore, Adenauer's clamoring and visit to the United States soon after cannot but be regarded as a noteworthy sign.

    阿登纳的“冷战”叫嚣
    席林生
    近来，西德的“冷战骑士”阿登纳又在积极地进行冷战叫嚣了。他到西柏林去作挑衅性“访问”的时候，公开鼓吹维持西柏林的占领制度。在那里他叫喊：如果发生原子战争，“苏联将荡然无存”。他要西方国家抛开去年日内瓦东西方外长会议上所已经取得的结果，在未来的最高级会议上明白表示绝不允许改变西柏林的“法律地位”。在电视演讲中，阿登纳又重弹起在德国问题没有解决前不可能解决西柏林问题的滥调。
    这位臭名昭著的西德“冷战骑士”，从今年开年以来的短短十几天中，就在不断地发出这种冷战的叫喊。他在荷兰的一家报纸上写道：西德要以“对执行防御作出贡献”的“坚决意志”来反对苏联。在他八十四岁生日那一天，他又叫喊“没有实力，就无所谓政策”，“德国必须强大到能够收复失地的程度”。看来阿登纳是不肯放过任何一个毒化国际气氛的机会的。
    在过去一段时间里，国际局势的发展越来越有利于和平，而不利于帝国主义的冷战政策；美国在世界舆论的压力下，也不得不表示愿意举行东西方最高级会议。阿登纳的公开叫嚣，也曾经一度有所收敛。当时，西德的报纸说他是在表面上保持“沉默”“等待”机会。因此，现在阿登纳不甘“沉默”，经常发出冷战叫嚣，显然不是偶然的。这同最近以来美国对于最高级会议的态度有着密切的关系。
    人们记得，不久以前美国的当权人物艾森豪威尔、赫脱曾经不断表示，美国愿意“用会议桌而不是用武力来解决国际争端”，“愿意早日举行最高级会议”，希望通过认真的谈判“带来缓和世界紧张局势的因素的真正的希望。”最近艾森豪威尔提出的国情咨文说得更动听：美国要“致力于和平事业”，它对于举行最高级会议的“新的机会的态度是极其认真的”等等。有些西方通讯社甚至说美国同西德阿登纳的僵硬的态度有很大的分歧。但是，美联社12日报道华盛顿对阿登纳冷战叫嚣的反应，却给人以完全不同的印象。它写道：美国的态度是，既然在日内瓦会议上没有达成协议，“那么最高级会议就得从头谈起。这是同阿登纳的态度一致的。”而事实上，美国同阿登纳的这种“态度一致”并不是突然出现的。
    还在去年美国总统艾森豪威尔出国作“和平和亲善”访问之前，也就是美国政府首脑人物不断表示美国“努力谋求和平”的时候，阿登纳竭力希望最高级会议尽量推迟一些。而一些美国报纸也在叫嚷东西方最高级会议“越迟越好”。当时艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上一方面表示希望“尽早”举行会议，另一方面又以西方确定共同立场的必要性为词，同意了戴高乐推迟会议的意见。法新社说，艾森豪威尔的谈话“坚定了阿登纳的信心”。
    许多西方通讯社也透露，西方国家同苏联的谈判始终使美国害怕会促使国际局势更加向着不利于帝国主义的方向发展，会松懈西方阵营的意志。不久前美国众议院外交委员会对西欧政策的报告就曾指出：在欧洲“对跟苏联谈判的兴趣越来越大，这对我们是一个沉重的负担”。因此美国政府就企图向人们要求同苏联谈判的热望浇冷水。美国国务卿曾故意散布怀疑苏联的论调说，苏联是否准备举行认真的谈判，还“有待证明”；“北大西洋公约组织联盟的防御力量和进一步加强这种力量仍然具有根本的重要意义”。而阿登纳也竭力敲边鼓，叫喊“我们一定不要放松我们的戒备”，“至今没有什么东西能使我们相信共产主义制度是认真地打算奉行谅解政策的”。于是举行东西方最高级会议的一个障碍又出现了。美国国务卿赫脱在去年12月北大西洋集团理事会会议上说：“同苏联进行的谈判将是相当长期的”。美国“明星晚报”直率地供认这是西方实行“拖延外交”，“将月复一月，也许是年复一年地拖延悬而未决的重要问题的解决”。这显然完全合乎阿登纳的胃口。
    北大西洋集团理事会举行会议以后，接着西方又召开了美、英、法、西德四国首脑参加的西方最高级会议。这次会议上，阿登纳在美国和其他西方国家的怂恿下表现得更为嚣张。阿登纳要求盟国“防止”改变柏林的现状；要求抛弃日内瓦外长会议上的进展，对柏林问题的“任何”重新讨论都应从所谓的“分阶段计划”开始。果然，西方最高级会议的最后公报，在柏林和德国问题上“重申了1958年12月14日四国公报，和北大西洋理事会1958年12月16日关于柏林的宣言中所规定的原则”。这实际上是西方退回到前年的“僵硬立场”，同意了阿登纳的主张。当时西方记者们指出，这是西方国家重新拣起早已破烂不堪的“一揽子计划”作为同苏联谈判的基础，“这意味着盟国的态度已变得强硬了”（合众国际社）。会后西德政府发言人埃卡特表示，阿登纳对这一次会议“十分满意”。
    因此不难看出，阿登纳目前的“冷战”叫嚣，是受到美国对东西方最高级会议态度的怂恿和鼓励的。把阿登纳看作美国对最高级会议的测候器，是一点不过份的。现在有消息说，阿登纳将在不久之后去华盛顿同艾森豪威尔会谈，“打算阻止他的盟国在与俄国人谈判中作出任何危险的让步”。因此，阿登纳的叫嚣和不久后的访问美国，不能不认为是一个值得注意的迹象。
