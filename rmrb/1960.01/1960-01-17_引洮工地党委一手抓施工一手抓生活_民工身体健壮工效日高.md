(Reported by our newspaper) The CCP Yin-Tao Engineering Bureau Committee is simultaneously focusing on both construction and the lives of the laborers, ensuring that over 100,000 laborers building the mountain canal in the high mountains and harsh snowy weather are well-fed, warmly clothed, well-rested, healthy, and in good spirits. The attendance rate of direct laborers has reached 99.1%, and work efficiency is improving daily, with an average daily earth and stone excavation efficiency of 18 cubic meters per person.

Actively running the canteens well is one of the central tasks in ensuring the people's well-being. Currently, there are 502 canteens on the entire construction site, each serving an average of 200 people. Each canteen raises its own pigs and sheep, feeds chickens and ducks, grows vegetables, and makes tofu to develop non-staple food production. Currently, 26 large-scale comprehensive ranches have been established in the work areas and the engineering bureau. At the end of 1959, there were 2,915 pigs, an increase of 1.43 times compared to 1958; 7,059 sheep, an increase of 2.3 times compared to 1958; 522 cattle, horses, and donkeys; and over 600 chickens, ducks, and rabbits. In addition, 4,673 mu of vegetables were planted, yielding a total storage of over 3.4 million jin of vegetables. Furthermore, every team has a tofu workshop, every district has a non-staple food processing plant, and every stove has a bean sprout bed. Last year, the construction site supplied the laborers with 3,855 pigs, 3,719 sheep, 586 cattle, horses, and donkeys, as well as chickens, totaling over 430,000 jin of meat. The average monthly meat consumption per person was six liang. The average daily vegetable consumption per person was twelve liang. This has greatly improved the lives of the laborers. In the laborers' canteens, the Party Committee focused on tool reform and technical innovation, promoting advanced tools such as automatic suction stoves, greenhouse continuous stoves, bun warmers, insulated dining cars, pulley steamers, and multi-blade bun cutters. This enabled advanced units such as the Huining work area to basically achieve mechanization and automation of kitchen work. Originally, one cook could only prepare food for 20 people, but now they can generally prepare food for 40 people. In addition, the Party Committee sent cadres to the construction site to establish canteen experimental fields, and the cooks worked hard to improve the variety of dishes and cooking techniques, which greatly satisfied the laborers. They composed songs praising:
    "Political command breaks through difficulties, cadres come to run experimental fields, use your brains to experiment more, operate carefully and change the patterns; handle-shaped steamed buns and sparrow tongue noodles, filled dumplings and oily flower rolls, eat different food for half a month, everyone is happy and satisfied!"

95% of the Yin-Tao construction site is located in the mountains and valleys, and most of the laborers' accommodation, except for a very few who use civilian housing, are temporary simple sheds. Before the arrival of winter, in order to ensure the health of the laborers, the Party Committee mobilized them to build new homes at the construction site. According to incomplete statistics, over 2,000 houses and over 10,000 cave dwellings have been built, with heated brick beds universally installed and straw curtains hung on doors and windows. This has greatly improved the living conditions of the laborers. Party organizations at all levels also mobilized female laborers to form sewing groups to mend and sew old clothes for the laborers to solve the problem of keeping warm. The entire construction site has basically achieved hot buns, hot rice, hot vegetables, hot soup, and hot stoves, while also fully supplying cotton coats, cotton trousers, cotton quilts, cotton bedding, cotton shoes, cotton hats, and cotton gloves. The laborers said gratefully, "The Communist Party is the sun, Chairman Mao is better than our parents! Thinking thoughtfully and acting early, realizing 'five hots' and 'seven cottons,' our hearts and bodies are warm and our enthusiasm is high!"

The Engineering Bureau Party Committee also attaches great importance to medical and health work at the construction site. Currently, a base hospital and four regional hospitals have been built. Each work area has its own health center. Each brigade has a health station, and each squadron has a health worker. There are over 400 regular hospital beds and 1,830 simple hospital beds on the entire construction site. Due to the patriotic health campaign carried out among the laborers, many new model villages of construction site hygiene like "Daliushu Village" have emerged. The incidence of illness among the laborers has decreased from 10% in the early stage of construction to 0.5%. 111 disease-free squadrons (accounting for 20.5% of the total number of squadrons) and 107 disease-free brigades (accounting for 11% of the total number of brigades) have emerged in the entire work area.

The Yin-Tao project will have water flowing through the Manba River by May 1st this year and water flowing to Guanshan by August 1st. Water must flow through more than 260 kilometers in eight months. Construction at the site is progressing at a breakneck pace and is extremely tense. However, the Engineering Bureau Party Committee has made proper arrangements for the laborers' work and rest, hard work and recuperation, ensuring that the laborers have eight hours of rest every day, one hour of study every day, and a full day off every ten days. In this way, the laborers eat well, dress warmly, sleep well, and rest well. They are healthy, rosy-cheeked, strong, and particularly energetic when working, which powerfully promotes the continuous leaps forward in engineering construction.

The Yin-Tao Engineering Bureau Party Committee has the following characteristics in its work to greatly improve the lives of the laborers: First, the Party Committee leads, and the secretary takes command. Party organizations in each work area and brigade have established a laborers' livelihood management committee. They regularly include the laborers' lives on the Party Committee's agenda. They grasp it at least once or twice a month. Cadres go deep into the construction site to eat, live, work, study, and enjoy recreation with the laborers. Leading cadres not only conduct inspections but also squat down to create typical examples, summarize experiences, and promote them comprehensively. The laborers said, "The Big Dipper, star to star, fingernail connects to flesh, flesh connects to heart; the Yin-Tao construction site is a family, the cadres and laborers are closer than brothers!"

Second, the laborers' livelihood is their own business. The main thing is to mobilize the masses and rely on them to do it themselves. In terms of food, the laborers form a food committee; in terms of medical and health, there is a patriotic health committee. They regularly listen to the opinions and requirements of the masses and constantly establish and improve various systems. Democratic management is done very well. The laborers have educated themselves.

Third, the administrators, cooks, medical personnel, commercial workers, and other personnel who serve the laborers are regularly given ideological education to establish a political viewpoint, a production viewpoint, and a mass viewpoint. They should care for the laborers, love the laborers, treat the laborers as relatives, and wholeheartedly serve the laborers. In this way, the service personnel can use their brains and do everything possible to improve the lives of the laborers.

Fourth, the Party Committee adopts a leadership method of grasping both ends and driving the middle, holding on-site meetings, commending advanced units, and promoting backward units, so that the 200-kilometer-long canal construction site unfolds a "one-dragon" competition of catching up with each other.

    引洮工地党委一手抓施工一手抓生活
    民工身体健壮工效日高
    本报讯　中共引洮工程局委员会一手抓施工一手抓生活，保证十余万建设山上运河的民工，在崇山峻岭间，在严寒的风雪里，吃饱穿暖休息好，身体健康，心情舒畅，出勤直接工达到99．1％，工效也日新月异地提高，平均每人每日土石方的工效达到十八立方米。
    积极办好食堂是抓好民工生活的中心内容之一。现在全工地共有民工食堂五百零二个，每个食堂平均供应二百人吃饭。每个食堂都自己养猪羊，喂鸡鸭，种蔬菜，做豆腐，发展副食品生产。现在工区和工程局已建立二十六个大型综合牧场。1959年年底栏存生猪二千九百一十五头，比1958年增长一点四三倍；有羊七千零五十九只，比1958年增长二点三倍；有牛马驴等五百二十二头，鸡鸭兔六百多只；种菜四千六百七十三亩，共收储蔬菜三百四十万多斤。另外，队队设有豆腐坊，区区设有副食品加工厂，灶灶设有豆芽床。去年工地共供应民工食用猪三千八百五十五头，羊三千七百一十九只，牛、马、驴五百八十六头，还有鸡等，共宰肉四十三万多斤。平均每人每月六两。每人每日平均有蔬菜十二两。这就大大地改善了民工生活。在民工食堂中，党委大抓工具改革和技术革新，推广了自动吸风炉、温室连环灶、暖馍箱、保温餐车，滑轮蒸笼和多刃切馍机等先进工具，使会宁工区等先进单位的食堂基本上实现了灶房劳动机械化和自动化。原来一个炊事员只能做二十人的饭，现在普遍能做四十个人的饭。加上党委派干部深入工地建立食堂试验田，炊事员在花色品种上下了工夫，提高烹调技术，使民工吃得非常满意，他们编歌儿称赞道：
  “政治挂帅破难关，干部来搞试验田，开动脑筋多试验，细心操作花样变；刀把蒸馍雀舌面，包儿饺子油花卷，半月不吃重样饭，人人满意心喜欢！”
    引洮工地95％在丛山险涧，民工的住宿除了极少数借用民房以外，大部分都是搭临时性的简易工棚。冬季来临以前，为了保证民工身体健康，党委发动民工在工地修建新家园。据不完全统计，现在共已修建房屋二千多间，挖窑洞一万多座，普遍盘好热灶，门窗挂上草帘。使民工住宿条件大大改善。各级党组织还动员女民工成立缝纫组，为民工拆旧缝新，解决御寒问题。全工地已经基本上做到馍热、饭热、菜热、汤热、灶热，同时充分供应棉衣、棉裤、棉褥、棉被、棉鞋、棉帽、棉手套。民工们感动地说：“共产党是太阳，毛主席赛爹娘！想得周到动手早，“五热”“七棉”实现了，心身温暖干劲大！”
    工程局党委还十分重视工地的医疗卫生工作。目前已经建筑一个基地医院和四个地区医院。各工区都有自己的卫生院。大队有卫生所，中队有保健员。全工地共有正规病床四百多张，简易病床一千八百三十张。由于在民工中开展爱国卫生运动，已经出现许多“大柳树村”式的工地卫生模范新村。民工的发病率已由开工初期的10％下降为0．5％。全工区已出现一百十一个无病中队（占中队总数的20．5％。）和一百零七个无病大队（占大队总数的11％）。
    引洮工程今年“五一”要通水漫坝河，“八一”要通水到关山。在八个月间要通水二百六十多公里。工地施工争分夺秒，异常紧张。但是工程局党委对民工的劳和逸、苦战和休整，进行了妥善安排，使民工每天有八小时休息，每天有一小时学习，十天一整休。这样，民工们吃饱、穿暖、睡好、休息好，身体健康，红光满面，臂粗腰圆，干起活来特别有劲，有力地促进工程建设不断跃进。
    引洮工程局党委在大抓民工生活工作中，有以下几个特点：一、党委领导，书记挂帅。各工区、各大队党组织均建立民工生活管理委员会。经常把民工生活列入党委议事日程。每月至少要抓一二次。干部深入工地，与民工同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同娱乐。领导干部不但巡回检查，而且蹲点创造典型，总结经验，全面推广。民工们说：“北斗星，星对星，指甲连肉肉连心；引洮工地是家庭，干部民工比兄弟还亲！”
    二、民工生活是群众自己的事情，主要的是发动群众，依靠群众自己动手来搞。他们在伙食方面由民工组成伙委会，医疗卫生方面有爱国卫生委员会，经常听取群众的意见和要求，不断建立和健全各种制度，民主管理做得很好。民工自己教育了自己。
    三、对管理员、炊事员、医务人员、商业工作者等为民工服务的工作人员，经常进行思想教育，要他们树立政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，关心民工，热爱民工，把民工当亲人，全心全意为民工服务。这样，服务人员就能开动脑筋，千方百计地为搞好民工生活而努力。
    四、党委采取抓两头、带动中间的领导方法，召开现场会议，表扬先进，促进后进，使二百多公里长的渠道工地展开“一条龙”的你追我赶的竞赛。（附图片）
