This newspaper reports: The People's Communes in Taihe County, Anhui Province, are focusing on tool reform and actively preparing for spring plowing.

This year, the county plans to increase the spring planting area by 75% compared to the same period last year. According to the labor required for spring crops and other production tasks, more than 530,000 workers are needed. However, the county only has more than 320,000 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied workers. Not only is there a shortage of labor, but also a shortage of existing farm tools and their efficiency is low. For example, more than 80,000 deep plows and field machines are needed, but before November of last year, there were only more than 40,000, leaving half to be modified. Under the leadership of the county party committee, the communes first modified tools that required more manpower and had high labor intensity. According to current statistics, the county has modified and imitated a total of 170,380 deep plows, close-planting drills, rope-traction machines, fertilizer transport vehicles, and other spring planting tools. Including the originally modified tools, this accounts for more than 85% of the new-style tools needed for production throughout the county.

Party committees at all levels have strengthened leadership at each level for the work of modifying spring plowing production tools, and vigorously mobilized the masses. In addition to the county establishing a technological revolution headquarters and an agricultural tool research institute, and each commune establishing a technological revolution command post and an agricultural tool research group, the county party committee also actively adopted effective measures to solve the difficulties of insufficient technical strength and raw materials. Throughout the county, in addition to the county agricultural tool research institute holding training classes for technicians and cultivating more than 80 tool reform experts, party committees at all levels also frequently held skill competitions, on-site demonstrations, and adopted the method of "inviting in and sending out" to impart technology. Nearly 200 people in the county were sent to Zhengzhou, Bengbu, Hefei, and other places to learn technology and returned to the county, and more than 70 people were invited to the county to teach and help. At the same time, various places also raised a total of 719 cubic meters of trees and wood, and more than 31,000 catties of scrap iron through cash purchases, mobilizing the masses to exchange materials, and taking materials to carpentry factories for processing.

    立即动手修制农具
    本报讯　安徽省太和县各人民公社正以工具改革为中心，积极做好各项春耕准备工作。
    今年全县计划将春播面积比去年同期增加75％，根据春种作物和其他各项生产所需要的劳力达五十三万多人。可是全县整半劳力只有三十二万多个，不但劳力不足，而且现有农具也少，效率较低。如深耕犁和田机等需要八万多件，但去年11月份以前只有四万多件，还有一半需要改制。各公社在县委的领导下，首先改制用人多、劳动强度大的工具。据目前统计，全县共已改制和仿制了深耕犁、密植耧、绳索牵引机、运肥车等各种春种工具十七万零三千八百九十多件，连同原改制的工具占全县生产所需新式工具的85％以上。
    各级党委对改制春耕生产工具工作，都层层加强领导，大力发动群众。除县里建立技术革命指挥部和农具研究所，各公社建立了技术革命指挥所和农具研究组以外，县委还积极采取有效措施，解决技术力量和原材料不足的困难。全县除县农具研究所举办技术人员训练班，培养八十多名工具改革能手外，各级党委还经常举行比武会、现场表演和采取“请进来，派出去”的办法，传授技术。全县派往郑州、蚌埠、合肥等地学了技术回县的有近二百人，请到县里来传授帮助的有七十多人。同时各地还以现款收购、发动群众兑料及带料到木器厂加工等形式，共筹集树、木料七百一十九立方，废铁三万一千多斤。
