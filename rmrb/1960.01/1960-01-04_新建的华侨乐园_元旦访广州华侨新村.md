The Newly Built Overseas Chinese Paradise
— A New Year's Visit to Guangzhou Overseas Chinese New Village
By our correspondents Cen Lidan and Chen Xinxian
On the morning of New Year's Day, we visited the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese New Village, known as the "Overseas Chinese Paradise." We walked along Huanshi Road towards the scenic area in the northern suburbs, and a beautiful residential area quickly came into view. Here, rows of exquisitely built buildings with pleasing colors were nestled on the hillside. Tidy tree-lined avenues crisscrossed the village. In the gardens of each residence, filled with southern flowers and plants, children were jumping and playing games like setting off firecrackers and offering New Year greetings. Gray-haired returned overseas Chinese were watching with happy smiles as the younger generation celebrated the New Year.

Zhao Huaxie, the first returned overseas Chinese to settle in the Overseas Chinese New Village, has a particularly deep appreciation for today's happy life. He is a third-generation overseas Chinese from the United States. His grandfather died in the United States, and later his father also died from poverty and illness. In order to make a living, Zhao Huaxie sailed across the ocean to the United States at the age of eighteen. In 1947, with a heart longing for his motherland, he returned to Guangzhou. However, as soon as he arrived in Guangzhou, his luggage was robbed at the pier. Later, his residence was repeatedly robbed. The foreign currency he had earned with his blood and sweat was exchanged for Kuomintang "silver dollar notes," which devalued rapidly in just a few days. Angered, he only stayed for four months before leaving the country again in tears. In 1954, Zhao Huaxie heard from his daughters-in-law in China that earth-shaking changes had taken place in the motherland. He returned with a skeptical attitude. After returning to China, he was not only cared for and respected by his compatriots everywhere, but also witnessed the good social order and peaceful life of the people in the motherland. He was extremely satisfied. Upon hearing that the government was planning to build the Overseas Chinese New Village, he was the first to register to build a house. Now, Zhao Huaxie is a People's Representative of Guangzhou. He said: "I have spent five New Years in the New Village and am very satisfied with everything here. If the motherland had not been liberated, I, Zhao Huaxie, would probably have died in a foreign country like my grandfather."

Speaking of the construction of this beautiful village, Lin Shijiang, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia who now works in the Overseas Chinese New Village Construction Committee, told us: Every brick, tile, grass, and tree in this village embodies the Party and government's meticulous care for overseas Chinese. In the first phase of the construction plan, the government allocated 25 hectares of land as the village site, and also reserved more than 50 hectares of land for future expansion of the New Village. In addition, preferential measures were stipulated, such as free residential land and the allocation of private garden space, as well as exemption from property tax for five years. Over the past five years, the government has spent 500,000 yuan on building roads, water and electricity lines, and beautifying the environment in the New Village. Now, more than 130 houses have been built in the New Village, and more than 150 households living here are returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese from more than ten countries in the Americas and Southeast Asia. Near the New Village, markets have been built, shops, theaters, and banks have been opened, and a bus line has been opened. This year, 80 new houses, three large apartments, and a public canteen will continue to be built here, allowing more overseas Chinese to enjoy the warmth of the motherland's big family.

In the Overseas Chinese New Village, what makes the returned overseas Chinese particularly happy is the Overseas Chinese Primary School standing on the hilltop behind the New Village. This is a well-equipped school with a teaching building, auditorium, student dormitories, library, etc., with a construction area of more than 7,000 square meters. The more than 800 students studying here include children of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese living in the New Village and other areas of Guangzhou, and many children are children of overseas Chinese living abroad. These students whose homes are abroad take the school as their home. The school contacts their parents abroad to take care of their lives and studies. On the colorful wall posters celebrating New Year's Day at the school, and in the exhibition charts where students report their achievements to their parents, we saw that the students' academic performance, ideological awareness, and physical health are constantly improving. All graduates from 1957 to 1958 were admitted to middle school. Some students have also been selected as swimming athletes and badminton athletes in Guangzhou.

    新建的华侨乐园
    ——元旦访广州华侨新村
    本报记者　岑荔丹　陈信贤
    元旦的上午，我们访问了被称作“华侨的乐园”的广州市华侨新村。我们沿着环市大道向北郊的风景区走去，一个美丽的住宅区很快就呈现在眼前。这里，一幢幢色彩悦目的精巧建筑，鳞次栉比地座落在小山岗上；整洁的林荫大道横贯全村，在各个住宅种满南国花草的庭园里，孩童们蹦蹦跳跳，在玩着放爆竹、拜新年等游戏，白发苍苍的老归侨含着幸福的微笑在观看着年轻一代在欢度一年一度的新岁。
    第一个在华侨新村安居的归侨赵华协，对今天的幸福生活体会特别深切。他是个三代侨居美国的华侨，他祖父死在美国，以后父亲也因贫病交迫死了。赵华协为了生活，十八岁就飘洋过海到美国谋生。1947年，他怀着眷恋祖国的心情回到广州，可是，他刚到广州，就在码头上被人抢去行李，以后又接连在住所遭到抢劫，他用血汗换来的一些外币，兑成了国民党的“银元券”不上几天就接连贬值，他气得只住了四个月，就又含泪出国。1954年，赵华协听到在国内的儿媳们说祖国已经起了翻天覆地的变化，他怀着半信半疑的心情回来了。回国后，他不但到处受到祖国亲人的爱护和尊重，而且亲眼见到祖国社会秩序良好，人民生活安逸，他满意极了。一听到政府筹划兴建华侨新村，他第一个登记建一幢房子。现在，赵华协是广州市的人民代表，他说：我在新村度过五个新年了，对这里的一切都十分满意，如果不是祖国获得解放，我赵华协恐怕也像祖父一样，将来老死异国了。
    谈起这个美丽的村庄的建设经过，现在华侨新村建设委员会工作的印度尼西亚归侨林世奖告诉我们：这个村子的一砖一瓦、一草一木都凝结着党和政府对华侨无微不至的关怀。在第一期建设规划中，政府拨出了二十五公顷土地作为建村地址，还留出五十多公顷土地作为新村将来扩展的用地；此外，还规定了住宅地皮免费和另拨给私人花园空地和免收房地户税五年等优待办法。五年来，政府为修建新村的马路、水电线路和美化环境等就先后用了五十万元。现在新村已建成一百三十多幢住宅，住在这里的一百五十多户人家，都是美洲和东南亚等十多个国家的归侨和华侨眷属。在新村的附近，还建筑了市场，开办了商店、剧场、银行，并开辟了公共汽车专线。今年，这里将继续新建八十幢住宅、三座大型公寓和一座公共食堂，让更多的侨胞在这里享受祖国大家庭的温暖。
    在华侨新村，使归侨们特别感到高兴的，就是屹立在新村后面山岗顶上的华侨小学。这是一所设备完善的学校，有教学大楼、礼堂、学生宿舍、图书馆等，建筑面积共七千多平方米。在这里学习的八百多个学生，有的是家居新村和广州其他地区的归侨、侨眷子弟，有许多儿童是侨居国外的华侨子弟。这些家在国外的学生都以校为家，由学校和他们在国外的家长联系，照顾他们的生活和学习。在学校庆祝元旦的五光十色的墙报上，在学生向家长们汇报成绩的展览图表中，我们看到这里的学生的学习成绩、思想觉悟和身体健康都不断提高。1957年到1958年度的毕业生，全部考上了中学。有的学生还被选拔为广州市的游泳选手、羽毛球选手。
