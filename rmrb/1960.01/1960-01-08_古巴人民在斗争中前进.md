The Cuban people have now completed a year since overthrowing the pro-American Batista dictatorship. In this year, the Cuban people have repeatedly crushed the heinous subversive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its agents, defended the independence and sovereignty of the country, and implemented land reform. The victory and continued development of the Cuban revolution have become a model for the people of all Latin American countries in their struggle for national independence and democratic freedom, and its influence is expanding and deepening.

In the past year, the Cuban people have made tremendous achievements in consolidating the revolutionary regime. After the establishment of the Cuban provisional government, it immediately transformed the old state apparatus. Significant measures in this regard included: dissolving the old Congress and special courts; dismissing all governors, mayors, and members of parliament from the reactionary regime and depriving these people and leaders of political parties who collaborated with the dictatorial regime of their political rights for thirty years; purging Batista elements from government and cultural and educational institutions; banning the activities of reactionary political parties; reorganizing the police, judicial organs, and army that suppressed the people under the old regime, and establishing revolutionary courts and revolutionary armed forces based on the rebel army, driving away the U.S. military delegation that had "trained" and controlled the Cuban armed forces; executing war criminals, traitors, and murderers with heinous crimes; and confiscating the property of counter-revolutionary criminals and embezzlers.

While destroying the old state apparatus, the Cuban provisional government announced the restoration of citizens' political rights and the activities of patriotic democratic political parties, released political prisoners, and allowed political exiles to return home; abolished the "Bureau for the Suppression of Communist Activities," the Military Intelligence Office, and the Investigation Bureau, and other organs that suppressed the people; issued a statement against racial discrimination, and restored the right of working people to organize trade unions.

Nevertheless, many members of the Cuban provisional government in the early days of the revolution were right-wing figures from bourgeois political parties. These people limited the revolutionary goal to overthrowing the dictatorship and restoring the 1940 Constitution. Under the situation of the high revolutionary enthusiasm of the people at home, and at the crucial moment when U.S. imperialism was intensifying its interference and subversive activities, they wavered and compromised, and even openly sided with the enemy. Therefore, the new Cuban government had to undergo four reorganizations in February, June, July, and December to purge those vacillating right-wing elements and traitors, so as to consolidate the revolutionary regime.

The promulgation and implementation of the new land reform law is an important measure taken by the Cuban revolution after its victory in reorganizing the social and economic structure.

Cuba is a country with a high concentration of land ownership. According to the survey materials of 1946 listed in the Cuban Land Reform Law, 2,336 large estates controlled 317,000 caballerias (one caballeria equals 201.45 Chinese mu) of land, meaning that 1.5% of landowners occupied more than 46% of the country's cultivated land area; while 111,000 small farmers with less than two caballerias of land owned only 76,000 caballerias of land in total, meaning that 70% of landowners occupied less than 12% of the country's cultivated land area. In addition, there were about 62,000 peasant households owning less than three-quarters of a caballeria of land. Nearly 60% of the country's farmers had no land and had to rent land and hand over a quarter to half of their harvest to the large estate owners. U.S. monopoly capital is the largest estate owner in Cuba. It seized more than 160,000 caballerias of land, accounting for about 25% of Cuba's cultivated land area and 75% of the fertile land, through means of seizing, annexing, and buying at low prices. Such concentration of land forced the vast number of landless or land-poor farmers to rent land from the large estate owners and be subjected to cruel exploitation. Because U.S. companies single-mindedly pursued high profits, recklessly developing sugar cane plantations, it created a single-product economy in Cuba and undermined the normal development of Cuban agriculture. In order to increase farmers' enthusiasm for production, increase agricultural products, and make the national economy independent, Cuba urgently needed land reform. As early as October 10, 1958, the rebel army led by Castro promulgated and implemented the "Third Decree" on land reform in the Sierra Maestra mountains, distributing state-owned, compulsorily purchased, and confiscated private land to landless or land-poor farmers two caballerias per household without compensation. However, this decree did not propose abolishing the large estate system that maintained feudal land relations, nor did it involve the land occupied by U.S. companies. After the victory of the revolution, at the request of the broad masses of the people, the Cuban provisional government promulgated a new land reform law on May 17, 1959, stipulating the abolition of the large estate system, the elimination of feudal exploitation, and the prohibition of foreign companies from owning land in Cuba.

Because Cuba's land reform has a dual meaning of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and directly touches the interests of U.S. monopoly capital, U.S. imperialism colluded with the reactionary forces in Cuba to sabotage it in every possible way. The U.S. State Department even sent several notes to the Cuban government, openly interfering in Cuba's land reform. However, with the support of the entire people, the Cuban government ignored U.S. interference, carried out the land reform, and took over a year in advance and sent troops to occupy the large estates of those U.S. estate owners who sabotaged the land reform.

According to the announcement of the National Land Reform Committee of Cuba, as of December 3, 1959, it had taken over 65,653 caballerias of land from 575 large estates. The taken-over land is distributed in all provinces of the country, and the land takeover work in Matanzas Province has been completed. After these lands were taken over, they were distributed to landless or land-poor farmers two to five caballerias without compensation, and the work of establishing cooperatives was carried out at the same time. For the expropriated land, compensation will be given according to the land price declared to the municipal authorities for tax payment before the land reform. The compensation will be paid in installments in the form of bonds over twenty years.

Cuba's land reform, to a certain extent, gave a fatal blow to the main enemies of the revolution—the United States and the large estate owners in Cuba, and appropriately satisfied the land demands of the peasants, so its progressive significance is the main aspect.

Due to the long-term plunder of the Cuban economy by U.S. monopoly capital, the plundering of the state treasury by the dictatorial tyrant Batista when he fled, and the serious damage caused by two years of civil war, Cuba faced serious economic difficulties in the early days of the revolution. U.S. imperialism and its pawns predicted that Cuba's economy would "collapse" and hoped to strangle the Cuban revolution through economic pressure. However, the attempt of U.S. imperialism failed. In the past year, in addition to promulgating and implementing the land reform law with significant political and economic significance and confiscating the property of counter-revolutionary elements, the Cuban provisional government has taken many active measures in stabilizing finance, reorganizing the economic structure, developing industrial and agricultural production, and expanding foreign trade, so that Cuba has achieved many successes in the economy. The national economic income in 1959 is estimated to reach 2.5 billion pesos (Cuban currency unit, equivalent to the U.S. dollar), an increase of 17% compared with 1958.

In the early days of the revolution, the Cuban provisional government regarded stabilizing finance, restoring transportation lines destroyed by the war, and ensuring the timely harvesting of sugarcane and production of sugar as the primary tasks in the economic field. In order to encourage the people's enthusiasm for production, the provisional government also adjusted the relationship between factory owners and workers, increased the wages of sugar cane workers by 12%, and generally reduced urban rents by 30% to 50%. Later, due to the implementation of land reform and the takeover of some large sugar mills that played a destructive role in production, the production of sugar in 1959 exceeded the quota.

In order to change the deformed development of Cuba's colonial single economy caused by U.S. imperialism for a long time, the Cuban provisional government, while carrying out land reform, instructed the National Land Reform Committee to mobilize state funds to vigorously run cooperatives for planting various crops, as well as cooperatives for animal husbandry, credit, consumption, materials, and tools. In recent months, 426 cooperatives have been established nationwide. Due to the implementation of the plan to develop various crops and the increased production enthusiasm of farmers after the land reform, in addition to the bumper harvests of sugarcane, coffee, and tobacco in 1959, compared with 1958, the output of rice increased by more than 1.5 million quintals, potatoes increased by 300,000 quintals, cotton increased tenfold, and the sown area of peanuts, soybeans, and vegetables also increased, thereby reducing the import of these commodities and saving foreign exchange.

The Cuban provisional government has also done a lot of work in realizing national industrialization. First of all, it took some measures to protect and develop national industries, such as stipulating that industries other than sugar industry, mining, etc. can reduce profit tax by 25%, and the interest rate on loans for industrial and agricultural production is reduced from 6% to 2%, etc. The Cuban government also promulgated the abolition of all concession rights of U.S. companies and the petroleum law and mining law restricting the exploitation of U.S. capital, and began to take over the land occupied by U.S. steel, nickel, and cobalt mining companies.

From the first day of the Cuban revolution, the United States has done everything possible to sabotage it. With the deepening development of the revolution, especially after the promulgation of the land reform law in May 1959 and the replacement of several right-wing ministers in June, U.S. imperialism saw that the Cuban government was increasingly consolidated and intensified its subversive activities against Cuba.

The U.S. subversive activities against Cuba mainly take the following forms: 1. Actively preparing for armed intervention. In the early days of the Cuban revolution, the United States attempted to send warships to Cuba for armed intervention. Later, although the United States had to be somewhat restrained from launching open armed intervention due to the firm struggle of the Cuban people and the sympathy and support of the people of all countries, especially the Latin American people, for the Cuban revolution, the United States still increased its troops to 30,000 at its Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba, which it occupied, and regularly held demonstrations and exercises. At the same time, the United States also openly armed the war criminals who fled from Cuba, and through Trujillo, it collected members of the Spanish "Blue Division" and Nazis to form the so-called "Anti-Communist Corps," using the Dominican Republic and Miami in the southern United States as bases, attempting to launch armed attacks from the outside. 2. The United States sent a large number of spies to sneak into Cuba, and colluded with traitors mixed in the revolutionary camp, such as former Air Force Commander Diaz Lanz, former President Urrutia, and former Camagüey Province troop commander Hubert Matos and others, to organize subversive activities from within Cuba. 3. Attempting to use the "Organization of American States" as a tool against the Cuban revolution, and actively planning to organize an "international police force," fabricating the so-called incidents of Cuban "invasion" of Panama, Nicaragua, and Guatemala, in an attempt to use the collective power of Latin American countries to interfere in Cuba. 4. Putting economic pressure on Cuba, attempting to force Cuba to submit by reducing the quota of sugar imported from Cuba. 5. Using all means, mainly using the slander of so-called "Communist infiltration" of government agencies, attempting to arouse mutual suspicion within Cuba in order to split Cuban unity. Although these conspiracies of the United States have been defeated, it has not given up and is still intensifying the work of organizing and training mercenaries and Cuban treasonous criminals in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, Haiti, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Miami in the United States, preparing to attack Cuba.

However, the U.S. subversive activities against Cuba precisely exposed the face of U.S. aggressors, further arousing the Cuban people's anger against it. As pointed out by the Cuban government in its reply to the United States on November 13, 1959, "Ghosts and monsters cannot scare the Cuban revolution." The Cuban people's response to the interventionists is: holding three large demonstrations of one million people against U.S. intervention, resolutely implementing land reform, and launching donation work to organize militias, implement military training, and strengthen national defense throughout the country. The Cuban people are redoubling their vigilance, ready to meet the enemy who dares to invade Cuban territory at any time. (Attached picture)

    古巴人民在斗争中前进
    章叶
    古巴人民推翻巴蒂斯塔亲美独裁政权已满一年了。在这一年中，古巴人民一次又一次地粉碎了美帝国主义及其代理人穷凶极恶的颠覆阴谋，保卫了国家的独立和主权，并实行了土地改革。古巴革命的胜利和继续发展，已经成为拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族独立和民主自由的榜样，它的影响正在扩大和深入。
    一年来，古巴人民在巩固革命政权方面的成就是巨大的。古巴临时政府成立后，立即对旧的国家机器进行了改造。在这方面的重大措施有：解散旧的国会和特别法庭；解除反动政权时代所有的省长、市长和议员的职务，并且剥夺这些人以及同独裁政权合作的政党领导人的政治权利三十年；清洗政府和文教机关中的巴蒂斯塔分子；取缔反动政党的活动；改组旧政权镇压人民的警察、司法机构和军队，建立了革命法庭和以起义军为基础的革命武装力量，赶走了曾经“训练”和控制古巴武装力量的美国军事代表团；处决了罪大恶极的战争、叛国和杀人罪犯；没收了反革命罪犯和贪污分子的财产。
    古巴临时政府在摧毁旧的国家机器的同时，宣布恢复公民政治权利和爱国民主政党的活动，释放了政治犯，并允许政治流亡人士回国；撤消了“共产党活动镇压局”、军事侦察处和调查局等镇压人民的机关；发表了反对种族歧视的声明，并恢复了劳动人民组织工会的权利。
    尽管如此，革命胜利初期的古巴临时政府的阁员，有许多是资产阶级政党的右翼人物。这些人把革命目的只限于推翻独裁政权和恢复1940年宪法。他们在国内人民革命热情高涨的形势下，在美帝国主义加紧进行干涉和颠覆活动的关头，发生动摇妥协，甚至公开投靠敌人。所以古巴新政府不得不在2月、6月、7月和12月经过四次改组，清洗那些动摇妥协的右派分子和叛徒，使革命政权得以巩固。
    颁布和实行新的土地改革法，是古巴革命胜利后在改组社会和经济结构方面的一项重要措施。
    古巴是一个土地高度集中的国家。根据古巴土地改革法中所列举的1946年的调查材料，二千三百三十六个大庄园控制了三十一万七千卡瓦耶里亚（一卡瓦耶里亚等于二百零一点四五中国亩）的土地，即1．5％的土地所有者占有全国耕地面积46％以上；而十一万一千占地不到两卡瓦耶里亚的小农户，总共只拥有七万六千卡瓦耶里亚的土地，即70％的土地所有者占有的土地不到全国耕地面积的12％。此外，还约有六万二千农户拥有的土地面积不到四分之三卡瓦耶里亚。全国有将近60％的农民没有土地，他们不得不租佃土地而把收成的四分之一到一半交给大庄园主。美国垄断资本是古巴最大的庄园主，它们以霸占、并吞和低价收购的方式夺取了十六万多卡瓦耶里亚的土地，约占古巴耕地面积的25％，占肥沃土地的75％。土地这样集中，迫使广大无地或少地的农民租种大庄园主的土地，受到残酷的剥削。由于美国公司单纯追求高额利润，不顾一切地发展甘蔗种植园，造成古巴单一生产经济，破坏了古巴农业的正常发展。为了提高农民的生产热情，增加农业产品，使国家经济独立发展，古巴迫切需要土地改革。早在1958年10月10日，卡斯特罗领导的起义军就在马埃斯特腊山区颁布并实施了关于土地改革的“第三号法令”，把国有、强制征购和没收私人的土地，无偿地分给无地或少地的农民每户两卡瓦耶里亚。但是，这个法令并没有提出废除维持封建土地关系的大庄园制度，也没有涉及美国公司占有的土地。革命胜利后，在广大人民的要求下，古巴临时政府在1959年5月17日颁布了新的土地改革法，规定废除大庄园制度，取消封建剥削和禁止外国公司在古巴占有土地。
    由于古巴的土地改革具有反帝反封建的双重意义，并直接触动了美国垄断资本的利益，美帝国主义就勾结古巴的反动势力，千方百计地进行破坏。美国国务院甚至几次照会古巴政府，公开干涉古巴的土地改革。但是，古巴政府在全体人民的支持下，没有理会美国的干涉，还是进行了土地改革，并且提前一年接管和派军队占领那些破坏土地改革的美国庄园主的大庄园。
    据古巴土地改革全国委员会宣布，到1959年12月3日为止，已经接管了五百七十五个大庄园的六万五千六百五十三卡瓦耶里亚的土地。被接管的土地分布在全国各省，其中马坦萨斯省的土地接管工作已经结束。这些土地被接管后，无偿地分给无地或少地的农民二到五卡瓦耶里亚，同时进行了建立合作社的工作。对于被征用的土地，将根据土地改革前向市政机关申报纳税的土地价格给予赔偿。赔偿费以债券形式在二十年内分期支付。
    古巴的土地改革，在一定程度上给了革命的主要敌人——美国和古巴的大庄园主以致命的打击，适当地满足了农民的土地要求，因而它的进步意义是主要的。
    由于美国垄断资本对古巴经济的长期掠夺、独裁暴君巴蒂斯塔逃跑时洗劫了国库和两年内战的严重破坏，使革命胜利初期的古巴面临着严重的经济困难。美帝国主义及其走狗曾预言，古巴的经济行将“崩溃”，并指望通过经济压力扼杀古巴革命。但是，美帝国主义的企图落空了。一年来，古巴临时政府除了颁布并执行具有重大政治和经济意义的土地改革法和没收反革命分子的财产以外，在稳定金融、改组经济结构、发展工农业生产和扩大对外贸易等方面采取了不少积极的措施，使古巴在经济上获得不少成就。1959年的国民经济收入估计达二十五亿比索（古巴货币单位，与美元等值），比1958年增加17％。
    在革命胜利初期，古巴临时政府把稳定金融、恢复被战争破坏的交通线，以保证适时收割甘蔗和生产食糖作为经济方面的首要任务。为了鼓励人民的生产积极性，临时政府还调整了厂主和工人之间的关系，把蔗糖工人的工资提高12％，并把城市房租普遍降低30％到50％。后来，由于实行土地改革和接管了一些在生产中起破坏作用的大糖厂，使1959年糖的生产超过了定额。
    为了改变长期以来由美帝国主义所造成的古巴殖民地单一经济的畸形发展，古巴临时政府在进行土地改革的同时，责成土地改革全国委员会调动国家的资金，大力举办种植多种作物的合作社以及牧畜、信贷、消费、物资、工具等合作社。最近几个月以来，在全国已经成立了四百二十六个合作社。由于执行发展多种作物的计划和农民在土地改革后生产情绪提高，1959年除甘蔗、咖啡、烟草丰收以外，同1958年相比，稻米的产量增加了一百五十多万公担，土豆增加了三十万公担，棉花增加了十倍，花生、大豆和蔬菜的播种面积也增加了，从而减少了这些商品进口，节约了外汇。
    古巴临时政府在实现国家工业化方面也作了不少工作。首先采取了一些保卫和发展民族工业的措施，如规定糖业以外的工业、矿业等减免利润税25％，对工农业生产放款的利息从6％降到2％等等。古巴政府还颁布了废除美国公司一切租让权和限制美国资本盘剥的石油法和矿业法，并开始接管美国钢铁、镍矿和钴矿等公司占有的土地。
    从古巴革命胜利的第一天起，美国就千方百计地进行破坏。随着革命的深入发展，特别是在1959年5月颁布土地改革法和6月撤换了几个右翼部长以后，美帝国主义看到古巴政府日益巩固，更加紧了它对古巴的颠覆活动。
    美国对古巴的颠覆活动，主要采取下列几种方式：一、积极准备武装干涉。在古巴革命胜利初期，美国曾企图派遣军舰到古巴去进行武装干涉。后来虽然由于古巴人民的坚决斗争和各国人民、特别是拉丁美洲人民对古巴革命的同情和支持，使美国发动公开的武装干涉不能不有所顾忌，但是，美国还是在它霸占的古巴关塔那摩海军基地增派了三万兵力，经常举行示威演习。同时美国还公开武装从古巴逃出去的战犯，通过特鲁希略搜罗西班牙“兰色师团”的成员和纳粹分子组成所谓“反共兵团”，以多米尼加和美国南部的迈阿密作基地，企图从外面武装进攻。二、美国派遣大批特务潜入古巴，并勾结混在革命阵营里的叛徒，如前空军司令迪亚斯·兰斯、前总统乌鲁蒂亚和前卡马圭省部队司令乌维尔特·马托斯之流，从古巴内部组织颠覆活动。三、力图利用“美洲国家组织”作为反对古巴革命的工具，并积极策划组织“国际警察部队”，制造所谓古巴“入侵”巴拿马、尼加拉瓜和危地马拉三国的事件，妄图利用拉丁美洲国家的集体力量干涉古巴。四、向古巴施加经济压力，企图用削减从古巴进口食糖的定额，迫使古巴屈服。五、用尽一切办法，主要是用所谓“共产主义渗入”政府机关的谰调，企图引起古巴内部互相猜疑，以分裂古巴的团结。美国的这些阴谋活动虽然遭到了失败，但它并没有死心，仍然在多米尼加、尼加拉瓜、危地马拉、洪都拉斯、海地、墨西哥、哥斯达黎加以及美国的迈阿密等地加紧组织和训练雇佣兵和古巴叛国罪犯的工作，准备进攻古巴。
    但是，美国颠覆古巴的阴谋活动，恰恰暴露美国侵略者的面目，更加激起了古巴人民对它的愤怒。正像古巴政府在1959年11月13日向美国提出的复照中所指出的，“妖魔鬼怪吓不倒古巴革命”。古巴人民对干涉者的答复是：举行了三次一百万人的反对美国干涉的大示威，坚决实行土地改革，在全国各地展开组织民兵、实行军事训练和加强国防的捐献工作。古巴人民正加倍地提高警惕，准备随时迎击胆敢侵犯古巴国土的敌人。（附图片）
