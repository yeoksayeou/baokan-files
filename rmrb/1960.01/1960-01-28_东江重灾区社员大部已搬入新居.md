Most commune members in the severely affected areas of the Dongjiang River basin in Guangdong Province—Huiyang, Boluo, Dongguan, and Zengcheng counties—have moved into new houses, ready to celebrate the Spring Festival. By January 20th, a total of 92,961 new and repaired houses had been built in the disaster areas of the four counties in just over five months. In many new villages, the new houses are tall, and the streets are wide, presenting a clean and prosperous scene.

Most of these newly built houses have walls made of blue or red bricks. Those with walls made of mud bricks generally have brick foundations or stone footings. In terms of style, there are multi-story buildings and single-story houses, some side-by-side and some with independent courtyards. Generally, they have halls and rooms with bright glass windows, and some new houses even have corridors. Due to the implementation of the principle of "people build, the government assists" and the full utilization of old materials during construction, the cost of these new houses is generally relatively low. When these commune members moved into their new homes, they expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Party and the People's Commune, comparing the present with the past. Zeng Yuerong, a commune member of Fucheng Commune in Boluo County, recalled the tragic situation of the 1947 flood before liberation when she moved into her new house. That year, the flood washed away her house, and the whole family had nowhere to live. Suffering from hunger and cold, her husband and two children died one after another. She had to work for the landlord until the land reform when she was allocated a house. Last year, after her house was washed away by the flood, the commune quickly built her a new one. She was so excited that she couldn't sleep for several nights and thought of a couplet: "Never forget the Communist Party after liberation; happiness comes from Chairman Mao," and asked someone to write it and paste it on the door. Since then, she has been getting up before dawn every day to take the lead in work and strive for production. (According to Xinhua News Agency report)

    东江重灾区社员大部已搬入新居
    广东东江流域重灾区惠阳、博罗、东莞、增城四县绝大部分受灾社员都已搬入新房，准备欢度春节。到一月二十日止，在短短五个多月内，四县灾区新建和修建房屋共达九万二千九百六十一间。在许多新村里，新房高大，街道宽敞，呈现一派整洁兴旺的景象。
    这些新建成的房屋，大部分都是以青砖或红砖作墙，一些用坭坯砌墙的，也普遍砌了砖基或石脚。在式样上，有楼房也有平房，有并列的也有独院的，一般都有厅有房、有明亮的玻璃窗，一部分新房还有走廊。由于在修建中贯彻了“民建公助”和充分利用旧料的方针，这些新房一般造价都比较低廉。当这些社员搬进新房时，抚今追昔对党和人民公社发出了由衷的感激。博罗县附城公社社员曾月容搬进新房时，想起了解放前一九四七年遭受水灾的惨状。那一年，洪水冲垮了房子，全家无处安身，饥寒交迫，不久丈夫和两个孩子便相继死去，自己只好给地主做工，直到土地改革才分到一所房子。而去年房子被洪水冲塌之后，公社很快地就给自己盖了新房。她激动得几个晚上都睡不着觉，想了一副对联：“翻身不忘共产党，幸福来自毛主席”，托人写好贴在门上。从此，她每天天不亮就起来带头出工，努力生产。　（据新华社讯）
