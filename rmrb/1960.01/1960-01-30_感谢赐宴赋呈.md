    A Poem of Gratitude for the Banquet
    Chen Shutong　Eve of Spring Festival

    The hall is filled with the warmth of spring at the night banquet,
    Everyone here is like a celestial being at a divine gathering;
    To repay the Party's grace, deeper than the sea,
    From now on, I will follow its leadership.

    感谢赐宴赋呈
    陈叔通　春节前夕
    华堂夜宴座生春，都是神仙会里人；
    为报党恩深似海，从今领导要遵循。
