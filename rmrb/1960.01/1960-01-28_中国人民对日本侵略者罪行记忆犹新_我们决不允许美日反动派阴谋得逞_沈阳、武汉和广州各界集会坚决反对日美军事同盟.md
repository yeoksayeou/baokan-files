Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 27th: More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Shenyang, who suffered greatly from Japanese militarism in the 1930s and 1940s, solemnly gathered on the afternoon of the 26th to severely condemn and resolutely oppose the US-Japan military alliance treaty. They expressed their firm support and high respect to the Japanese people who are struggling for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality against this treaty.

Ning Wu, Chairman of the Liaoning Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting. Ning Wu said that the so-called "US-Japan Mutual Cooperation and Security Treaty" signed by the US and Japanese reactionaries is a blatant aggressive military alliance treaty aimed at the people of China and the Soviet Union and the people of all of Asia. This is a serious step in the US imperialist policy of aggression and expansion in Asia.

Ning Wu said that the people of our country have vivid memories of the aggressive crimes of Japanese militarism, and we will never allow the US and Japanese reactionaries' aggressive conspiracy to succeed.

Ning Wu concluded by saying that the people of our country have always sympathized with and supported the just struggle of the Japanese people. We firmly believe that the fate of Japan is decided by the Japanese people, and all the evil conspiracies of the US and Japanese reactionaries will eventually be thoroughly bankrupt.

Representatives from democratic parties, trade unions, women's federations, youth federations, and literary and art federations in Liaoning Province and Shenyang City who attended the meeting spoke successively, all resolutely opposing the US-Japan military alliance treaty and warmly supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 27th: More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Wuhan gathered yesterday morning to resolutely oppose the US and Japanese reactionaries' signing of an aggressive military alliance treaty and support the just struggle of the Japanese people.

The meeting was jointly convened by the Hubei and Wuhan branches of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions, the Wuhan Women's Federation, the Wuhan Youth Federation, and other organizations.

Zeng Dun, Chairman of the Hubei and Wuhan branches of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the US and Japanese reactionaries' signing of an aggressive military alliance treaty directly violates a series of international agreements signed by the Allied countries during and after World War II to prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism. It revives Japanese militarism and incorporates Japan into the US military bloc and atomic war system, forming a war base network hostile to the people of China, the Soviet Union, Korea, and Asian countries. This sinful collusion is absolutely intolerable to the powerful Chinese people, the awakened Asian people, and peace-loving people of all countries. The solemn statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs fully expresses the will of the Chinese people, and the people of Wuhan express their firm support.

Zeng Dun pointed out that the US and Japanese reactionaries, disregarding the resolute opposition of the Japanese people and peace-loving people of the world, signed a military alliance treaty, which precisely demonstrates the unprecedented isolation and weakness of imperialism. Zeng Dun said that the people of Wuhan firmly support the just struggle of the Japanese people to safeguard national interests, oppose war, and defend peace in Asia and the world, and firmly believe that the war conspiracy of the US and Japanese reactionaries will be completely shattered, and the Japanese people's desire for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will surely be realized.

Tu Yuncheng, Tang Zhe, Zhang Sijun, Li Dongqing, Chen Yuxi, Du Wangao, Cheng Yun and other leaders of the Wuhan local organizations of various democratic parties and Wuhan people's organizations spoke at the meeting successively. They all resolutely opposed the US-Japan military treaty and severely condemned the crimes of the US and Japanese reactionaries for colluding to revive Japanese militarism.

The meeting finally passed a resolution, expressing high respect to the heroic Japanese people for their just struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty and for safeguarding national interests.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 27th: More than 1,200 people from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City gathered on the afternoon of the 25th to resolutely oppose the US-Japan military alliance treaty and warmly support the just struggle of the Japanese people for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

The meeting was jointly held by the Guangdong and Guangzhou branches of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions, the Guangzhou Women's Federation, the Guangzhou Youth Federation, and other five organizations. The Japanese women's delegation visiting China, which is currently visiting Guangzhou, was also invited to attend the meeting.

Du Guoxiang, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting. He said that the so-called "Mutual Cooperation and Security Treaty" signed by the US and Japanese reactionaries in collusion is a thorough and thorough aggressive military alliance treaty. The military collusion between the US and Japanese reactionaries seriously threatens peace in the Far East and the world. The solemn statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 14th, resolutely opposing the US-Japan military alliance treaty, fully expresses the common will of the Chinese people. The people of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City resolutely support this statement from our government.

Feng Naichao, Chairman of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Wu Zhongxi, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Deng Jian, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Women's Federation, and others spoke successively at the meeting, unanimously condemning the US-Japan military alliance treaty and expressing their firm support for the just struggle of the Japanese people, and resolutely not allowing US imperialism to revive Japanese militarism and undermine peace in Asia.

    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会辽宁省分会主席宁武在大会上讲话。宁武说，美日反动派签订的所谓“日美共同合作和安全条约”，是一个露骨的、以中苏两国人民和全亚洲人民为敌的侵略性军事同盟条约。这是美帝国主义在亚洲进行侵略扩张政策的一个严重步骤。
    宁武说，我国人民对日本军国主义的侵略罪行记忆犹新，我们决不允许美日反动派的侵略阴谋得逞。

    曾惇指出，美日反动派不顾日本人民和世界爱好和平人民的坚决反对，签订军事同盟条约，正表明了帝国主义的空前孤立和虚弱。曾惇说，武汉人民坚决支持日本人民为维护民族利益、反对战争、保卫亚洲和世界和平的正义斗争，坚信美日反动派的战争阴谋必将被彻底粉碎，日本人民争取独立、民主、和平和中立的愿望一定会实现。
