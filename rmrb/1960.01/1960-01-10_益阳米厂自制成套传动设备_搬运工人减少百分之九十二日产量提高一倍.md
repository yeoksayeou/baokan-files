Changsha, January 8th – Workers at the Yiyang City Rice Mill in Hunan Province, vigorously engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution. Based on the original two rice milling machines, two threshing machines, and five electric motors, they self-made transmission equipment using indigenous methods, connecting the production process with rudimentary machinery. This resulted in a large reduction in personnel, a large increase in output, and a significant reduction in workers' labor intensity.

In the past, the factory operated in three shifts a day, with each shift requiring seventy handling laborers. Now, this has been reduced to five people. In the past, they could only process 180,000 catties of rice per day; now it has increased to more than 360,000 catties. In the past, temporary handling laborers accounted for a large proportion of the factory's workforce; now they have all been replaced by various transmission machines. The factory has completed this year's national plan 117 days ahead of schedule. The dozens of laborers saved have started three subsidiary factories for boiling sugar, pressing oil, and brewing wine, enabling the comprehensive utilization of rice bran and barnyard grass. Profits turned over to the state have increased from 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per year in the past to more than 140,000 yuan.

The reporter recently visited this rice mill. Upon entering the workshop, one immediately sees sets of bamboo and wood structure machines operating automatically and rapidly. In the three workshops on the upper and lower floors for cleaning impurities, hulling, and milling rice, only five people are stationed beside the main machines, and no other workers can be found. The dusty environment common in general rice mills is also nowhere to be seen.

The predecessor of this rice mill was three private rice mills, which were merged into a joint state-private enterprise in 1956. At that time, in addition to the four "old and toothless" machines used for hulling and milling rice, the remaining fifty or so processes were all manual operations. After the bumper grain harvest in 1957, the factory's task of processing rice increased. Relying solely on hard work was not enough to complete the task. The factory's Party branch decided to start with technical innovation. In just over a year, they used indigenous methods to adjust and refit each process, basically realizing rudimentary mechanization. After the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958, the factory's tasks increased even more than before. The higher authorities required the completion of production tasks under the principle of increasing production without increasing personnel or equipment. The Party branch called on the workers to continuously revolutionize and further develop technical innovation. However, some people believed that connecting the production process with machines required foreign machines and a large amount of capital. Some people were satisfied with the current achievements in mechanization and did not want to move forward. Although most workers believed in the Party's words, they did not know how to do it. At this time, the Party branch, on the one hand, called on the workers to liberate their minds and continue to leap forward. On the other hand, it organized the entire factory's workers to conduct discussions and debates on the topics of "Can the production process be connected with machines?" and "How to connect it?". Through the debate, the favorable conditions were analyzed, the thought of fear and timidity was criticized, and those with erroneous thoughts changed their original views. Gong Dongxi, a national advanced producer and technical innovation pacesetter, more confidently made a guarantee to the Party: he was determined to work hard and cleverly with the workers and connect the production process with machines in the first half of 1959. Thus, the refitting work began.

After the Party branch formulated the plan, it decided to first set an example, gain experience, and boost morale. This task was assigned to several experienced and skilled veteran workers led by Long Dongxi. The Party branch secretary and the factory director also went deep into the workshop to work with the workers and solve difficulties and key problems. Gong Dongxi and others first went to the impurity cleaning workshop, which had the most labor, the greatest labor intensity, and the most dust, to study. They first saw that the eight manual sieves in the impurity cleaning workshop were all laid flat on the ground. Sieving grain was labor-intensive and inefficient. Old Gong thought: It would be best to stack the eight sieves and install a hoist to transport the grain up. To install the hoist, with the support of the Party, the factory cleared out a batch of waste belts, waste steel, waste iron sheets, and waste wooden boards from the warehouse. The workers used these waste materials and started working. Lacking iron axles, they learned and forged while opening a red furnace; lacking lathes and planers for machining iron axles, they built earthen lathes and earthen planers with a combination of iron and wood... After more than a month of hard work and ingenuity, they finally connected the production process of the impurity cleaning workshop with machines. The Party branch immediately seized on this matter to carry out extensive publicity, and a mass movement to vigorously develop transmission equipment spread like a whirlwind throughout the factory.

Next, Gong Dongxi and his assistants installed an automatic lifting belt between the impurity cleaning workshop and the hulling workshop. In the past, the impurity cleaning workshop and the hulling workshop were disconnected. Each shift required forty to fifty people to transport grain from the impurity cleaning workshop to the hulling workshop upstairs. The workers were very tired and still couldn't meet the demand. After the hoist was installed, dozens of handling laborers were all saved.

The last hurdle was to eliminate the dust in each workshop. The impurity cleaning workshop with the most dust was often so dusty that one couldn't see one's fingers. Workers easily got sick after inhaling the dust. Some people suggested buying iron dust collectors. Gong Dongxi felt that this would cost a lot of money and they couldn't buy them for a while. He used a mixed structure of wooden boards, bamboo, and iron sheets to make a dust collector according to the principles of windmill blades and dust collectors, so that more than 90% of the grain dust in the room was sucked into the dust storage room.

In just over three months, the entire production process of the Yiyang City Rice Mill was connected with machines. According to the previous plan, it would cost more than 15,000 yuan. Now, only a small five-horsepower motor was added, and the total cost was only more than 1,000 yuan, which yielded such remarkable results.

    益阳米厂自制成套传动设备
    搬运工人减少百分之九十二日产量提高一倍
    本报长沙8日电　湖南省益阳市大米厂的职工，大搞技术革新和技术革命，在原来只有两台碾米机、两台龚谷机和五台电动机的基础上，用土办法自制传动设备，把生产过程用土机械衔接起来，从而使人员大减少、产量大增加，工人劳动强度大大减轻。
    过去，这个厂一日三班生产，每班需用搬运工人七十人，现在减少到五个人；过去每天只能加工大米十八万斤，现在增加到三十六万多斤。过去，全厂临时搬运工人占很大比重，现在他们都被各种传动机器代替了。这个厂已经提前一百一十七天全面完成了今年的国家计划。节省下来的几十个劳动力，开办了熬糖、榨油、酿酒三个附属工厂，使米糠、稗子得到综合利用。上缴利润由过去的每年两、三万元增加到十四万多元。
    记者最近访问了这个大米厂。一走进车间，立刻看到整套整套竹木结构的土机器，在自动地迅速地运转着。上下三层楼的清杂、砻谷、碾米三个车间，只有五个人守在几部主要机器旁边，其他地方找不到一个工人。一般米厂里那种灰尘很多的现象也看不见了。
    这个米厂的前身是三家私营米厂，1956年才合并改公私合营的。当时，生产车间除了砻谷、打米使用四部“老得掉了牙”的机器以外，其余五十多道工序都是手工操作。1957年粮食丰收以后，厂里加工大米的任务增加了。光靠苦战，完不成任务。厂党支部便决定发动工人从革新技术着手，一年多的时间，他们就用土办法把每道工序都进行了调整、改装，基本上实现了土机械化。1958年工农业大跃进后，厂里的任务比以前更增大了，上级要求在增产不增人、不增设备的原则下，完成生产任务。党支部号召职工不断革命，进一步开展技术革新。但这时有人却认为：要把生产过程用机器连接起来就离不了洋机器，要大批资金。有些人满足现在的机械化成就，不想前进。大多数工人虽相信党的话，但不知怎样去做。这时，党支部一方面号召职工解放思想，继续跃进，另一方面，以“能不能把生产过程用机器连接起来？”“怎样连接起来？”为题，组织全厂职工进行鸣放辩论。通过辩论，分析了有利条件，批判了畏缩不前的思想，有错误思想的人改变了原来的看法。全国先进生产者、技术革新标兵龚冬喜更信心百倍地向党提出保证：决心与工人一道苦干、巧干，要在1959年上半年把生产过程用机器连接起来。于是，改装工作就开始了。
    党支部制订了规划以后，决定先做出榜样，取得经验，鼓舞士气。这个任务交给了以砻冬喜为首的几个有经验、有技术的老工人，党支部书记和厂长也深入车间，与工人们一道干活，解决困难和关键问题。龚冬喜等首先深入全厂劳动力最多、劳动强度最大、灰尘最厚的清杂车间研究，他们首先看到了清杂车间的八部人工溜筛，都是平放在地面上，筛谷时，劳动强度大，工效不高，老龚想：最好是把八部溜筛叠起来，安上升降机把谷子运上去。为了安升降机，在党的支持下，全厂从仓库中清出了一批废皮带、废钢、废铁皮、废木板等。职工们就用这些废旧材料，动手干起来。缺少铁轴，自己开红炉边学边锻造；车铁轴没有车床和刨床，自己动手装了铁木结合的土车床和土刨床……经过一个多月的苦干和巧干，终于使清杂车间的生产过程用机器连接了起来。党支部马上抓住这件事进行广泛的宣传，一个大搞传动设备的群众运动，就在全厂范围内势如破竹地开展起来了。
    接着，龚冬喜和他的助手又在清杂车间与砻谷车间之间，装上一根自动升降带，清杂车间与砻谷车间过去是脱节的，每班要四、五十个人从清杂车间运谷到楼上的砻谷车间去，工人很累仍然供不应求。升降机装上后，几十个搬运劳动力全部省掉了。
    最后一道难关是消灭各车间的灰尘。灰尘最多的清杂车间经常伸手不见五指，工人们吸进灰尘以后，很容易生病，有人建议买铁吸尘器，龚冬喜觉得这样花钱多，一时又买不到。他就按照风车叶子和吸尘器的原理，用木板、竹子、铁皮混合结构做成了一个吸尘器，使室内90％以上的谷灰都吸进了储尘室。
    只三个多月的时间，益阳市大米厂全部生产过程都用机器连接起来。按照以前的计划，要花一万五千多元。现在，只增加了一部五马力的小马达，全部费用只花一千多元，便收到这样显著的成绩。
