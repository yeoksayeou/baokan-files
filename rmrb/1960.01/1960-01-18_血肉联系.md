    Flesh-and-Blood Ties
    He Beiren
    A doctor with communist ideals, a young Communist Party member named Comrade Li Gong, once cut four pieces of skin from his own leg to perform a skin graft operation that healed a burn on a Tibetan woman; he once drew fresh blood from his body, barely recovered from a serious illness, to save the lives of more than ten Tibetan brothers. He is a model of wholeheartedly serving the people.
    This event of a Communist Party member being connected by flesh and blood with more than ten Tibetan people is a manifestation of the communist spirit of selflessness. It is the comradely love and mutual assistance of people who are striving for the cause of communism. In the thousands of years of history of our great nation, this noble tradition of selflessness among the working people has been continuous. In the socialist era, the light of the Party illuminates people's hearts, making this tradition even more glorious and sublimating it to the lofty realm of consciously dedicating oneself to the collective interest. Communists, with their spirit of public service and their broad vision of taking the world as their responsibility, constantly inspire the masses to increase their proletarian consciousness, enhance the comradely feelings of love and friendship among the working people, and promote the growth of people's communist morality. Today, in our country, this noble spirit of mutual assistance and love has been greatly developed. Just take the small matter of blood transfusions, for example. We have not only seen communists giving blood to the masses, but we have also seen the masses giving blood to communists. In the past two years, hasn't countless people requested to give their blood to Communist Party members such as Xiang Xiuli, An Yemin, and Qiu Cai Kang? Doesn't this also show that communist ideological consciousness, comradely love and mutual assistance have been universally and unprecedentedly enhanced and increased among our people?
    The inspiration that Comrade Li Gong's noble actions give to people is not limited to these. Through the glorious image of this Communist Party member, we can also associate it with the close connection between our entire Party and the entire people. The interests of our Party and the masses of the people are completely consistent, and have always been a unified whole that shares weal and woe and lives and dies together. This is because the cause of communism is also the cause of the masses of the people. In the process of building our new China, the blood and sweat of the Communist Party members and the masses of the people have been exchanged; our brilliant construction achievements are the common crystallization of the Communist Party members and the masses of the people; the general line of our Party for building socialism represents the common will of the masses of the people; and in the unprecedented creation of the people's communes, the wisdom of the Communist Party members and the masses of the people is also intertwined!
    It is precisely by relying on this flesh-and-blood connection with the broad masses of the people that our Party has overcome all powerful enemies and begun to create the most magnificent, the most solemn, and the most splendid cause. The light of communism is strong, and the more our cause develops, the more consolidated, the closer, and the stronger this flesh-and-blood connection will become.
    Of course, within this whole, the Communist Party members are the most conscious and most advanced elements of the masses of the people; the Communist Party is the most organized and strongest part of the people, like the head and the nerve center of a whole. The will of the people, without the leadership of the Party, cannot be concentrated, the strength of the people, without the Party to organize them, cannot be brought into play, and our cause, without the leadership of the Party, cannot be created. Communist Party members, although they do not possess any special talents, do have a high degree of communist consciousness, a Marxist worldview, and a grand vow to dedicate everything to communism. Therefore, every Communist Party member bears a more important mission in the process of realizing our common cause. Every Party member should consciously play their vanguard role, should better unite and connect with the masses like Comrade Li Gong, should not shy away from hardships, and should bravely advance, holding high the banner of the vanguard. Comrade Li Gong's noble qualities and his heroic image, like our revolutionary cause, will forever shine brilliantly, inspiring hundreds of millions of people to move forward!

    血肉联系
    何北仁
    一个具有共产主义思想的医生，一个年青的共产党员李贡同志，他曾经从自己腿上割下四块皮肤，用植皮手术治好了一个藏族妇女的烧伤；他曾经从大病初愈尚未康复的身体上抽出鲜血来救活十多个藏族兄弟。他是全心全意为人民服务的模范。
    一个共产党员同十多个藏族人民血肉交融的这件事，是舍己为人的共产主义精神的体现。这是为共产主义事业而奋斗的人们同志式的友爱和互助。在我们伟大的民族几千年的历史中，劳动人民中的这种舍己为人的高贵的传统，是连绵不断的。到了社会主义时代，党的光辉照亮了人们的心，就使得这种传统更加发扬光大，并且上升到自觉地为集体利益献身的崇高境地。共产主义者用大公无私的精神，以天下为己任的胸怀，不断激励人民群众增长无产阶级意识，增加劳动人民之间同志式的友爱感情，促进人们共产主义道德情操的成长。如今，在我们国家里，这种互助互爱的崇高精神，有了极大的发扬。就拿输血这件小事来说，我们不仅看到过共产党人把鲜血输送给群众，而且也看到过人民群众把鲜血输送给共产党人。就在前年和去年，不是就有无数人要求把自己的鲜血输送给向秀丽、安业民和丘财康等共产党员吗？这不也能说明，共产主义的思想觉悟，同志式的友爱和互救，在我们人民之中，有了普遍的空前的提高和增长吗？
    李贡同志的崇高行为，所给予人们的启发还不止于这些，通过这个共产党员的光辉形象，还可以使我们联想到我们整个党同整个人民之间的密切联系。我们党同人民群众的利益是完全一致的，从来都是一个休戚相关、生死与共的整体。这是因为共产主义的事业，也就是人民群众的事业。在我们新中国的缔造过程中，交流着共产党人和人民群众的血汗；我们辉煌的建设成果，是共产党人和人民群众的心血共同化成的；我们党的建设社会主义的总路线，代表的正是人民群众的共同意志；在人民公社这一前无古人的创造中，也交织了共产党人同人民群众的智慧！
    我们的党正是靠了同广大群众的这种血肉的联系而战胜了一切强大敌人，并且开始缔造那最宏伟、最庄严、最壮丽的事业。共产主义的光芒强烈，我们事业愈发展，这种血肉般的联系就愈巩固、愈紧密、愈强大。
    当然，在这个整体之中，共产党人是人民群众中最觉悟最先进的分子；共产党是人民中最有组织最坚强的部分，犹如一个整体的首脑，神经的中枢。人民的意志，离开党的领导，便无从集中，人民的力量，离开党去组织，便不能发挥，我们的事业，离开了党的领导，也就无从缔造。共产党人，虽然并没有独具什么特别的天赋，但是，我们却有着高度的共产主义觉悟，有着马克思主义世界观，有为共产主义献出自己一切的宏伟誓愿。因此，每一个共产党员，在实现我们的共同事业过程中都担负有更为重大的使命，每个党员，都应该自觉地发挥自己的先锋作用，都应该像李贡同志这样更好地团结和联系群众，都应该不避艰苦，高举先锋队的旗帜，奋勇前进。李贡同志的高贵的品质，他的英雄的形象，与我们的革命事业一样，将永远发着灿烂的光辉，激励着亿万人前进！
