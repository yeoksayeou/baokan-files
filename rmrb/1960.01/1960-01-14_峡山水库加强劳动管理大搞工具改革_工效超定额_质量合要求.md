(Our newspaper, Jinan, January 13th) The Xiashan Reservoir in Shandong's Changwei Prefecture, under the slogan of "seizing time, taking the initiative, and completing this winter's construction tasks fifteen days ahead of schedule," has extensively launched a movement to exceed quotas and achieve high work efficiency, resulting in continuously improving work efficiency.

According to national quotas, this water conservancy construction site should produce 1.64 cubic meters of earthwork per person per day. However, after launching the high work efficiency movement, despite the freezing weather conditions, the 70,000 participating migrant workers achieved an average work efficiency of 4.69 cubic meters of earthwork per person, exceeding the national quota by more than onefold. The project's progress also surged from 31,000 cubic meters per day to 260,000 cubic meters, increasing work efficiency by more than sevenfold. Therefore, this construction site has become the construction unit with the highest work efficiency in Shandong Province's water conservancy projects.

Xiashan Reservoir is the largest mountain valley reservoir in Shandong Province and the first large-scale reservoir in the province other than Weishan. It is located between the four counties and cities of Weifang, Changi, Gaomi, and Anqiu in Changwei Prefecture and is a major pivotal project for fundamentally harnessing the Wei River and cutting it off. It covers a total area of 330,000 mu and is designed to store 1.085 billion cubic meters of water, capable of irrigating 2 million mu of land. The reservoir project is extremely arduous.

Due to the large scale of the project, the project's Party committee and headquarters paid close attention to carrying out a high work efficiency movement to accelerate progress, ensure quality, and reduce the labor intensity of migrant workers. At the beginning of construction, the entire construction site formed specialized teams for transporting soil, loosening soil, collapsing soil, leveling soil, and compacting, with the company as the unit and transporting soil as the central link. The construction method of "five guarantees and eight fixations" was universally promoted (five guarantees refer to guaranteeing personnel, tasks, quality, finances, and time; eight fixations refer to fixing work types, tools, sites, quality, quantity, time, work points, and quantitative grain supply). Based on the characteristics of large-scale operations at the construction site, military-style action, combat-style construction, collective living, and regular work schedules were also implemented. In terms of site arrangement, soil transportation roads were generally repaired, widened, compacted, and padded with sand, and clear distinctions were made between upper and lower roads to avoid congestion, mutual interference, and the occurrence of work-related injuries. In addition, strict planning management was implemented during construction, and the masses were mobilized to fully discuss and formulate overall construction plans and monthly, ten-day, and daily operation plans at all levels, so that everyone had a clear understanding and clear goals to strive for.

In the implementation of the plan, emphasis was placed on daily progress, with daily statistics and announcements. Within a day, the focus was tightly on: first, grasping labor attendance and vigorously reducing non-productive personnel with revolutionary spirit; second, grasping tools so that every tool could play its role; third, grasping tasks, completing the day's tasks on the same day and the morning's tasks in the morning, with timely inspection and comparison. As a result, the daily progress indicators were repeatedly exceeded.

The labor organization was also adjusted, and a "three-shift, six-operation" method was implemented, i.e., all migrant workers were divided into three shifts, working in rotation day and night, with each shift divided into two work periods, working eight hours successively. This operation method is very suitable for winter construction and has many benefits. For example, it can prevent the surface layer of the soil pond and dam surface from freezing, give full play to the role of tools, and ensure that migrant workers have sufficient rest time and other activities, which is very popular among migrant workers.

The project Party committee also focused on tool reform, viewing technological innovation not only as the main way to improve work efficiency, accelerate project progress, and ensure project quality, but also as a way to reduce the labor intensity of migrant workers. Therefore, technical innovation committees or tool reform leading groups were established at all levels of the construction site, and more than 1,000 technicians and iron and wood workers were transferred to form professional teams. More than 300 factories and groups specializing in repair, assembly, and manufacturing were also established as bases for technological innovation at the construction site. The project Party committee focused on key links such as loosening soil, loading soil, transporting soil to the dam, and quarrying and transporting stone, deeply mobilizing the masses and launching a high tide of offering suggestions and ideas with "everyone thinking of ways." Through mobilization at all levels, led by local experts, a technological innovation movement of creating, trial-producing, improving, popularizing, and using simultaneously was widely launched. In order to make the technological innovation movement continue to develop in depth, various work sections and camps also continuously held on-site meetings to quickly promote the use of advanced tools and advanced technologies. Some new tools, once successfully created, quickly blossomed throughout the entire construction site.

To date, the construction site has created, modified, and imitated 34 types of tools, more than 6,000 pieces, built 16,565 meters of iron and wood track, and manufactured 438 iron and wood dump trucks. The entire construction site has basically achieved rubber tire wheels for soil transportation, dump truck trains, bearingization of rotating tools, rapid loading and unloading, traction assistance for climbing slopes, mechanized compaction and rolling, and factory-style construction site. Many newly made tools have increased efficiency by several times to dozens of times. The power traction machine created by the construction site's repair and assembly plant can drive five small trucks up the dam at a time, and can tow 650 to 700 trucks up the dam per hour, increasing work efficiency by 30 times compared to human-powered trucks. Soil loosening and collapsing machines not only increase work efficiency by more than ten times compared to manual excavation, but also ensure construction safety. There have also been many creations in stone engineering, and the increase in work efficiency is also very significant.

In carrying out the high work efficiency movement, the project Party committee also attached great importance to project quality. It repeatedly strengthened the education of "quality first for a century-long plan" and construction specifications to the vast number of migrant workers and cadres, and mobilized the masses to supervise each other and consciously act in accordance with the specifications. The project Party committee also adopted short-term rotational training methods to train more than 300 construction, surveying, and statistical personnel, making up for the shortage of technical personnel. Quality inspection organizations were established from the headquarters to the grassroots construction units, with fixed sections and contracted responsibilities, and regular quality inspections were carried out. When placing soil on the dam, an acceptance system was implemented, and any substandard work was immediately reworked. In the red flag competition, quality was taken as one of the important contents of the assessment. The completed projects have been inspected and fully meet the quality requirements.

    峡山水库加强劳动管理大搞工具改革
    工效超定额　质量合要求
    本报济南13日电　山东昌潍专区峡山水库在抢时间，争主动，提前十五天完成今冬施工任务的口号下，广泛地开展了超定额高工效运动，工效不断提高。
    这个水利工地按国家定额是每人每日一点六四土方，但在开展高工效运动以后，尽管在天寒地冻的情况下，参加施工的七万民工，每人平均工效达到了四点六九个土方，超过国家定额一倍多，工程进度也由每日三万一千方猛增到二十六万方，提高工效七倍多。因此，这个工地成为目前山东全省水利工程工效最高的一个施工单位。
    峡山水库是山东省第一大山谷水库，也是除位山以外的全省第一个大型水库。它座落在昌潍专区的潍坊、昌邑、高密、安丘四县市之间，是根治潍河、腰斩潍河的大枢纽工程。总面积三十三万亩，设计蓄水量十亿八千五百万公方，能够浇地二百万亩。水库工程十分艰巨。
    由于工程任务很大，工程党委和指挥部十分注意开展高工效运动以加快进度，保证质量，减轻民工劳动强度。施工一开始，全工地便以连为单位，以运土为中心环节，组成了运土、松土、塌土、平土、夯实等各种专业队伍，普遍推行了“五包八固定”的施工方法（五包即包人员、包任务、包质量、包财务、包时间；八固定即固定工种、工具、场地、质量、数量、时间、工分和粮食供应定量）。根据工地大兵团作战的特点，还实行了行动军事化，施工战斗化，生活集体化和作息定时化。在场地安排上，运土道路普遍整修、加宽、夯实、垫沙，并且使上下道路分明，避免了拥挤和互相干扰以及工伤事故的发生。此外，在施工中还实行了严格的计划管理，发动群众充分讨论，层层制订了施工的总计划和月、旬、日作业计划，使人人心中有数，奋斗目标明确。
    在执行计划中，突出的抓日进度，一天一统计、一公布。在一天内又紧紧掌握：一、抓劳力出勤，以革命精神大力压缩非生产人员；二、抓工具，使件件工具都能发挥作用；三、抓任务，当天任务当天完，上午任务上午完，及时检查评比。这样一来，日进度指标便一再被突破。
    劳动组织也进行了调整，实行了“三班六作”作业法，即全体民工分作三班，昼夜轮流施工，每班又分两次干活，先后干八个小时。这种作业法，非常适于冬季施工，有很多好处。如可以使土塘、坝面表层不冻，充分发挥工具作用，保证民工有充分休息时间和其它活动时间，很受民工欢迎。
    工程党委还大抓工具改革，把技术革新不仅看成是提高工效、加速工程进度、保证工程质量的主要途径，而且看做是减轻民工劳动强度的途径。因此，工地各工段层层建立了技术革新委员会或工具改革领导小组，并抽调一千多名技术人员和铁木工人组成了专业队伍，还建立了三百多个专管修配和制造的厂、组，作为工地技术革新的基地。工地党委抓住松土、装土、运土上坝和开石、运石等主要环节，深入发动群众，掀起了一个“个个想办法”的献策献计高潮。通过层层发动，土专家带头，一个边创造、边试制、边改进、边推广、边使用的技术革新运动便广泛开展起来。为了使技术革新运动持续深入发展，各工段、营还不断召开现场会议，迅速推广使用先进工具和先进技术。有些新的工具一经创制成功后，很快就在全工地上开花。
    到目前为止，这个工地已创制、改制、仿制各种工具三十四种，六千多件，建铁木轨道一万六千五百六十五米，制铁木斗车四百三十八个。全工地基本上实现了运土胶轮化，斗车列车化，运转工具轴承化，装卸快速化，爬坡牵引化，夯实碾压机械化，工地工厂化。很多新制工具提高效率几倍到几十倍。工地修配厂创制的动力牵引机，一次能带动五辆小车上坝，每小时能牵引上坝小车六百五十到七百车次，比人力拉车提高工效三十倍。松土、塌土机不仅比人工挖土提高工效十倍以上，而且保证了施工安全。在石方工程中，也有很多创造，提高工效也很显著。
    在开展高工效运动中，工程党委也十分重视工程质量。对广大民工和干部反复加强了“百年大计，质量第一”和施工规范的教育，并发动群众相互监督，自觉地按规范办事。工程党委还采用短期轮训办法，培养了施工、测定、统计人员三百多人，弥补了技术力量的不足。从指挥部到基层施工单位都建立了质量检查组织，固定地段，包干负责，经常进行质量检查。在大坝上土时，实行验收制度，不够标准，即行返工。在红旗竞赛中，将质量作为评比重要内容之一。经检查现已完成的工程完全合乎质量要求。
