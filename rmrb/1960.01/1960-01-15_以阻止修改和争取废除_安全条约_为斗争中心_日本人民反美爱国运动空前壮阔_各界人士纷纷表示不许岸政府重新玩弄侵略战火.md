Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter reports: On the eve of Nobusuke Kishi's departure for Washington to sign a new Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the Japanese people are launching a new high tide in the movement against revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The three-day 11th National Unified Action of the Japanese People against revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" began today. This is the first large-scale demonstration of Japan's patriotic and democratic forces against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries nationwide in 1960. Since the news of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" being signed on January 19th this year broke last December, the Japanese people have felt extremely indignant. They have urgently mobilized to further strengthen the struggle for peace, neutrality, independence, and democracy. Even during the New Year, the Japanese people did not relax. On January 1st, twenty-five prominent Japanese women issued a joint statement supporting the proposal for complete disarmament and demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Progressive parties and organizations, as well as joint struggle organizations in various parts of the country, began preparing for large-scale protest rallies and demonstrations in the 11th Unified Action. An increasingly wide range of social strata have joined this struggle, which concerns the future development of Japan.

Nobusuke Kishi has recently received hundreds of letters opposing his revision of the "Security Treaty." The outwardly fierce but inwardly timid Nobusuke Kishi is alarmed by the rising tide of popular protests. His residence has been heavily guarded by the police, and his personal bodyguards have also been strengthened. The Japanese government is keeping the departure time of the plane Nobusuke Kishi will be on secret. There are reports that Kishi may not even dare to go to Haneda Airport from the main road on the 16th and will take a helicopter from his residence instead.

The situation facing the Japanese people in the new year is grim, but encouraged by the growing strength of international peace forces, they are high-spirited and full of confidence. The National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Japan Socialist Party, and the Communist Party of Japan have all stipulated in their action programs for this year that they will organize and mobilize more people from all walks of life to launch one unified action after another, not only to prevent the signing of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" but also to prevent the Japanese Diet from passing the treaty, and to persist in the struggle until the Japan-U.S. military alliance is abolished.

The tremendous achievements made by the Japanese people in the past year's struggle have laid the foundation for new victories in this year's struggle. The ten national unified actions last year rose one after another, disrupting the timetable of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries while gradually forming and strengthening the anti-American patriotic united front of the Japanese people. Since the establishment of the National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" jointly formed by the Japan Socialist Party, the Communist Party of Japan, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan last March, various forms of united front organizations have been rapidly formed throughout Japan. To date, not only have joint struggle organizations to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" been established at the central level and in all forty-six prefectures, but more than seven hundred joint struggle organizations have also been established in cities, counties, and towns, and organizations are currently being developed in rural and fishing villages. Judging from the scale of the movement, the first national unified action on April 15th last year, in which hundreds of thousands of people participated throughout Japan, has grown to a magnificent mass movement in the current unified action, with more than four million people simultaneously holding strikes, rallies, demonstrations, and petitions throughout the country.

The Japanese Communist Party's central organ, "Akahata," emphasized in its editorial on January 8th that the most important tasks for the Japanese people and democratic forces at present are to push the activities focused on preventing the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the direction of striving for the abolition of the "Security Treaty," and at the same time strengthen the struggle for the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations. Taking these two struggles as the center, the various struggles for complete disarmament, prohibition of nuclear armament, conclusion of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, and opposition to constitutional revision will be further developed in order to achieve a peaceful, independent, neutral, and democratic Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, January 14th: Tokyo News: On the eve of the departure of the Japanese government delegation headed by Nobusuke Kishi to the United States to sign the new "Security Treaty," people from all walks of life and public opinion in Japan have expressed strong opposition to this traitorous act of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

The "Hokkaido Shimbun" published an editorial on the 8th denouncing the Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to forcibly revise the "Security Treaty" and turn the current "Security Treaty" into a de facto Japan-U.S. military alliance. The editorial pointed out that, on the contrary, the Japanese people are eager to get rid of the relationship between Japan and the United States that has been maintained since the end of the war.

The newspaper also published an editorial on the 10th pointing out that revising the "Security Treaty" means that Japan will adhere to the "Cold War" policy of antagonizing China for the next ten years.

The "Asahi Shimbun" published editorials the day before yesterday and today, saying that Japan should adopt an attitude of maintaining friendly relations with all countries and seeking Japan's security and international peace. The newspaper is dissatisfied with the draft of the new treaty reached by Kishi Nobusuke with the United States. It said that at least we demand that the so-called "prior consultation" be changed to "prior consent"; the clause regarding the dispatch of U.S. troops stationed in Japan to combat operations outside Japanese territory be revoked; all clauses suspected of violating the spirit of the Constitution be revoked; and the treaty period be shortened.

Twenty-three prominent figures in the cultural field, including Tokyo University professor Tatsukuri Shigenari, Hitotsubashi University professor Tsuru Shigeru, commentator Kato Shuichi, and writer Hotta Yoshie, jointly published an article in the recently published monthly "Sekai," pointing out that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party are running counter to the world trend of easing international tensions and attempting to revise the "Security Treaty," which brings serious dangers to Japan.

The article emphasized that abolishing armaments and neutralization are the appropriate paths that conform to the spirit of the Japanese Constitution and are most secure for Japan.

The article condemned Japanese monopoly capital's conspiracy to accelerate the promotion of the militarization of the Japanese economy and turn Japan into an arms factory in Asia through the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Kibe Yohei, a Japanese war criminal who was recently released and returned from China, published a statement in "Akahata" today, strongly opposing Kishi Nobusuke's visit to the United States to revise the "Security Treaty."

Kibe emphasized that Japan, which committed serious crimes of aggression against China in the past, should now repent and make efforts to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations. We must never allow the Kishi Nobusuke government to replay the flames of war and lead Japan down the old path of aggressive war.

### 以阻止修改和争取废除“安全条约”为斗争中心  日本人民反美爱国运动空前壮阔  各界人士纷纷表示不许岸政府重新玩弄侵略战火

    以阻止修改和争取废除“安全条约”为斗争中心
    日本人民反美爱国运动空前壮阔
    各界人士纷纷表示不许岸政府重新玩弄侵略战火
    据新华社14日讯　本社记者报道：在岸信介即将去华盛顿签署新的日美军事同盟条约的前夕，日本人民掀起一个反对修改日美“安全条约”运动的新高潮。
    为期三天的日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的第十一次全国统一行动从今天开始了。这是日本的爱国民主力量在1960年在全国范围向美日反动派的第一次大示威。自从去年12月传出新的日美“安全条约”将在今年1月19日签字的消息以来，日本人民感到极大的激愤，他们紧急动员起来，进一步加强争取和平、中立、独立和民主的斗争。即使在新年期间，日本人民也没有松懈。1月1日，日本二十五位著名妇女发表联合声明，支持全面裁军的建议，并且要求废除日美“安全条约”。进步党派和团体以及全国各地方的共同斗争组织，开始为在第十一次统一行动中举行声势浩大的抗议集会和示威游行进行准备。愈来愈广泛的阶层投入了这场关系日本发展前途的斗争。
    岸信介最近已经收到了成百封反对他修改“安全条约”的信件。色厉内荏的岸信介对日益高涨的人民抗议感到惊慌。他的住宅已经由警察严加防卫，随身警卫也加强了。日本政府对岸信介将乘坐的飞机起飞的时间保守秘密。有消息说，岸信介16日甚至可能不敢从大路到羽田机场去，将从住宅坐直升飞机去。
    日本人民在新的一年中所面临的局势是险恶的，但是，在整个国际和平力量不断增长的形势鼓舞下，他们斗志昂扬，充满信心。阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议、日本工会总评议会、日本社会党和共产党都在今年度的行动纲领中规定，它们要组织和动员更多的各阶层人民展开一次又一次的统一行动，不仅要阻止签订新的日美“安全条约”，而且要阻止日本国会通过这项条约，并且要坚持斗争下去，直到废除这项日美军事同盟。
    日本人民在过去一年的斗争中取得的巨大成果，为今年斗争取得新的胜利奠定了基础。去年的十次全国统一行动一浪高一浪，打乱了美日反动派的时间表，同时使日本人民的反美爱国统一战线逐渐形成和壮大。自从去年3月由日本社会党、共产党和日本工会总评议会等联合组成的阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议成立以来，各种形式的统一战线组织在日本全国各地迅速形成。到今天，不仅在中央和全国四十六个都、道、府、县成立起阻止修改“安全条约”的联合斗争组织，而且在市、郡、町建立了七百多个联合斗争组织，目前还在向农村和渔村发展组织。从运动的规模来看，去年4月15日在日本全国有几十万人参加的第一次全国统一行动，已经壮大到目前的一次统一行动中就有四百数十万人在全国各地同时举行罢工、集会、示威和请愿的波澜壮阔的群众运动。
    日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”1月8日的社论强调指出，日本人民和民主力量目前最重要的任务是：把集中于阻止修改日美“安全条约”的活动推向争取废除“安全条约”的方向，同时加强争取恢复日中邦交的斗争，以这两个斗争为中心，使争取全面裁军、禁止核武装、缔结日苏和约、反对修改宪法等各项斗争进一步发展，以争取实现和平、独立、中立、民主的日本。
    据新华社14日讯　东京消息：在以岸信介为团长的日本政府代表团即将离日本前往美国签署新的“安全条约”前夕，日本各界人士和舆论纷纷表示强烈反对岸信介政府的这一卖国行为。
      “北海道新闻”8日发表社论痛斥岸信介政府企图强行修改“安全条约”，把现在的“安全条约”变成名副其实的日美军事同盟。社论指出，与此相反，日本人民渴望摆脱战后以来一直维持的日美之间的那种关系。
    这家报纸在10日还发表社论指出，修改“安全条约”意味着今后十年日本要坚持以中国为敌的“冷战”政策。
    “朝日新闻”在前天和今天发表社论说，日本应该采取同一切国家保持友好关系、谋求日本的安全和国际和平的态度。这家报纸不满岸信介同美国达成协议的新条约草案。它说，至少我们要求把所谓“事先协商”改为“事先同意”；取销关于驻日美军开到日本领土以外地区作战的条款；取销一切有违反宪法精神嫌疑的条款；缩短条约期限。
    东京大学教授鹈鉰信成、一桥大学教授都留重人、评论家加藤周一和作家堀田善卫等二十三位文化界著名人士在最近出版的“世界”月刊上联名发表文章指出，岸信介政府和自由民主党同国际紧张局势趋向缓和的世界潮流背道而驰，企图修改“安全条约”，这给日本带来严重的危险。
    文章强调指出，废除军备和中立化才是合乎日本宪法精神和对于日本最安全的合适道路的。
    文章谴责日本垄断资本阴谋通过修改“安全条约”加紧推行日本经济的军事化，把日本变成亚洲的兵工厂。
    不久以前被释放从中国归来的日本战争罪犯岐部与平今天在“赤旗报”上发表谈话，强烈反对岸信介赴美修改“安全条约”。
    岐部强调指出，过去对中国犯过重大侵略罪恶的日本，现在应该悔悟并为恢复日中邦交而作出努力。我们绝对不能容许岸信介政府重新玩弄战火，使日本走上侵略战争的老路。
