Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th. The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," published an editorial today calling on the Japanese people to transform tomorrow's mass rally in Tokyo against the signing of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" into a new starting point for a struggle that concentrates the people's power to deliver a fatal blow to the Kishi Nobusuke government and U.S. imperialism.

The editorial said that at tomorrow's rally, a large protest delegation will be formed to continuously protest to the Kishi Nobusuke government, the Liberal Democratic Party, the government delegation preparing to go to Washington, and the U.S. Embassy in Japan before January 16.

The editorial pointed out that such a large-scale unity of Japanese democratic forces to launch a protest movement against the people's enemies is the first time in Japan's post-war political history. This shows the great political growth of the Japanese people and democratic forces.

The editorial continued that the situation facing the Japanese people is very serious. Now is the time for the Japanese people to express their opposition to Kishi Nobusuke's trip to Washington to sign the revised "Security Treaty" throughout the country, and to show their determination to the Kishi Nobusuke government and U.S. imperialism.

Joint struggle organizations in various prefectures to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" are currently sending representatives to participate in tomorrow's mass rally in Tokyo. The 100-member delegation from Fukuoka Prefecture arrived in Tokyo last night; a 140-member delegation is scheduled to leave Hiroshima Prefecture today.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th. The "Conference of Jurists to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," composed of 1,500 Japanese lawyers and jurists, today issued an "Opinion on the Issue of Revising the Security Treaty," pointing out that the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" violates the Japanese Constitution.

The opinion stated that the revised "Security Treaty" will militarize Japan, violate the (Japanese) Constitution which stipulates that it shall not possess war potential, and strengthen Japan's dependence on the United States.

The opinion stated that the revision of the "Security Treaty" was negotiated in secret, without allowing the people to understand it. This practice also violates the purpose of the Constitution.

This opinion was delivered to the Kishi Nobusuke government this afternoon, and a copy was sent with a letter to U.S. President Eisenhower. The letter to Eisenhower emphasized that the revised "Security Treaty" is a military alliance that will allow foreign troops to be stationed in Japan for a quarter of a century. It will inevitably damage the friendly relations between the peoples of Japan and the United States and disrupt world peace.

Copies of this opinion were also sent to U.S. Secretary of State Herter and the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th. Former Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Nishi Haruhiko, published an article in the latest issue of "Chuo Koron" magazine, criticizing the Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Nishi Haruhiko compared the proposed new treaty with the Anti-Comintern Pact that Japan concluded with Germany and Italy in 1939. He said that Japan should learn from past experiences and not repeat the mistake of stubbornly pursuing wrong policies to the point of disaster.

Nishi Haruhiko mentioned a statement made by Foreign Minister Fujiyama Aiichiro at the last Diet session. This statement said that the mainland of China and the Soviet Union might be included in the areas where U.S. troops could be deployed. Nishi Haruhiko said that he had never heard any foreign minister make such a blatant and aggressive statement in the past.

Nishi Haruhiko also said that revising the "Security Treaty" will create another obstacle to normalizing diplomatic relations with China. Nishi Haruhiko emphasized that Japan can make its own contribution to easing international tensions, but revising the "Security Treaty" will undermine Japan's only opportunity to serve and endanger its relations with China and the Soviet Union.

Nishi Haruhiko said in the article that Japan must be prepared to bear all the accusations from the Soviet Union and China regarding Japan's revision of the "Security Treaty," because Japan is completely determined to sign the revised treaty on its own initiative.

Nishi Haruhiko opposed the view held by some that the new treaty will include a clause on "prior consultation" regarding U.S. military operations outside Japan, which is a progress compared to the existing "Security Treaty." He said that according to this provision, Japan will share the responsibility for the actions of the U.S. military, because, according to the current relationship between the two countries, Japan has no other way but to obey the United States.

Nishi Haruhiko emphasized the heavy financial burden formed by the military deployment stipulated in the new treaty. He warned that revising the "Security Treaty" will have a very adverse impact on Japan's security and the people's living standards.

    日共“赤旗报”号召人民积极行动起来
    集中力量打击美日反动派
    千五百名法学家发表意见书指出修改“安全条约”危害世界和平日前驻英大使认为日美军事同盟如同1939年德意日反共同盟
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日本人民把明天在东京举行的反对签订新的日美“安全条约”的群众大会变为集中人民力量，给岸信介政府和美帝国主义以致命打击的斗争的新起点。
    社论说，在明天的大会上，将组成一个大的抗议代表团，以便在1月16日以前连续向岸信介政府、自由民主党、准备去华盛顿的政府代表团和美国驻日本大使馆提出抗议。
    社论指出，日本民主力量这样大规模地团结起来对人民的敌人发起抗议运动，这在日本战后的政治史上还是第一次。这表明日本人民和民主力量在政治上的巨大增长。
    社论接着说，日本人民面前的形势是非常严重的。现在正是日本人民应该在全国各地表示反对岸信介去华盛顿签订修改的“安全条约”，向岸信介政府和美帝国主义显示他们的决心的时候。
    各县的阻止修改“安全条约”共同斗争组织目前正在纷纷派遣代表参加明天在东京举行的群众大会。福冈县的百人代表团已在昨晚到达东京；一个由一百四十人组成的代表团预定在今天离开广岛县。
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本一千五百名律师和法学家组成的“法学家阻止修改安全条约会议”今天发表“关于修改安全条约问题的意见书”，指出修改日美“安全条约”违反日本宪法。
    这个意见书说：修改后的“安全条约”将使日本军事化，违反规定不拥有作战力量的（日本）宪法，加强日本对美国的从属性。
    意见书说：修改“安全条约”谈判是在秘密情况下举行的，没有让人民有所了解。这种做法也是违反宪法宗旨的。
    这分意见书已经在今天下午交给岸信介政府，并且把抄本随信寄给美国总统艾森豪威尔。寄给艾森豪威尔的信强调指出，修改后的“安全条约”是一种军事结合，它将允许外国军队在日本驻扎达四分之一个世纪之久。它必然会破坏日美两国人民的友好关系和扰乱世界的和平。
    这分意见书的抄本还寄给了美国国务卿赫脱、美国国会参议院和众议院的外交委员会主席。
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本前驻英国大使西春彦在最新一期的“中央公论”杂志上发表文章，指责岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的企图。西春彦把拟议中的新条约同日本在1939年跟德国和意大利缔结的反共同盟相比较。他说，日本应该从过去的经验中吸取教训，而不应该重蹈执意奉行错误政策以致碰得头破血流的复辙。
    西春彦谈到外务相藤山爱一郎在上届国会会议上发表的一个声明。这个声明说，可能把中国和苏联的内地包括在美国军队出动的地区之内。西春彦说，他在过去从来没有听到过任何外务相发表这样露骨的侵略性的声明。
    西春彦又说，修改“安全条约”，将使同中国的外交关系正常化受到又一个障碍。西春彦强调说，日本能够对缓和国际紧张局势作出自己的贡献，然而修改“安全条约”将损害日本的这一仅有的效劳机会并危害它同中国和苏联的关系。
    西春彦在文章中说，日本必须准备承受苏联和中国对于日本修改“安全条约”的一切指责，因为日本完全是一意孤行地打算签订经过修改的这个条约的。
    西春彦反对有些人所持的看法，这种看法认为，新条约中将包括就美国在日本境外的军事行动进行“事先协商”这一条款，这同现有的“安全条约”相比是一个进步。他说，按照这一规定，日本将分担美国军队的行动的责任，因为，按照两国目前的关系，日本除了听命于美国之外别无他途。
    西春彦强调指出新条约规定的军事部署所形成的沉重财政负担。他警告说，修改“安全条约”将对日本的安全以及人民的生活水平产生非常不利的影响。
