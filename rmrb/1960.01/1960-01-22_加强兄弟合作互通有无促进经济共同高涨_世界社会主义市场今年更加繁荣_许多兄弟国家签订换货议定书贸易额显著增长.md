    Strengthen Brotherly Cooperation, Supply Each Other's Needs, and Promote Common Economic Upsurge
    The World Socialist Market is Even More Prosperous This Year
    Many Brotherly Countries Sign Commodity Exchange Protocols and Trade Volume Increases Significantly
    (Dispatch of this newspaper) The world socialist market is displaying a flourishing scene in the first year of the sixties.
    Many socialist countries signed commodity exchange agreements or protocols at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. The trade volume will increase greatly compared with last year.
    According to materials already published by various countries, the increase in trade volume among socialist countries this year is very large. For example, the trade volume between Romania and Albania this year will increase by nearly double compared with last year, the trade volume between Romania and Czechoslovakia will increase by 35%, the trade volume between the German Democratic Republic and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will increase by 60%, the trade volume between Bulgaria and the German Democratic Republic will increase by 50%, the trade volume between Hungary and Mongolia will increase by 40%, and the trade volume between Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria will increase by 45%.
    Trade with the Soviet Union occupies a significant position in the foreign trade of various brotherly countries. For example, the trade volume between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union this year will reach 7.5 billion rubles, and trade with the Soviet Union accounts for 45% of the total foreign trade of the German Democratic Republic. According to the recently signed agreement, the trade volume between the two countries will reach 50 billion rubles in the six years from 1960 to 1965. This is currently the largest trade agreement in the world. The trade volume between Poland and the Soviet Union this year will reach 3 billion rubles, a significant increase compared with last year. This year, Czechoslovakia's exports to the Soviet Union will increase by 40%, and the machines provided by the Soviet Union to Hungary will increase sixfold compared to 1958.
    Trade relations between socialist countries fully embody the spirit of equality, mutual benefit, and friendly cooperation. This trade aims to supply each other's needs and promote common economic upsurge. All countries provide each other with traditional export commodities while importing materials needed for domestic economic construction and people's livelihood. For example, according to this year's commodity exchange protocol, industrialized Poland will provide the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with various types of machinery and industrial products to help Vietnam establish and develop its own industry; Vietnam will provide Poland with rice, oil crops, jute, etc. All of the pig iron and non-ferrous metals lacking in the German Democratic Republic will be supplied by the Soviet Union, and 95% of imported petroleum will also be provided by the Soviet Union.
    Since the German Democratic Republic has a developed machinery industry, 47% of the machinery that the Soviet Union needs to import from foreign countries will be supplied by the German Democratic Republic.
    Currently, some socialist countries are holding trade negotiations to sign commodity exchange agreements for 1960.
    The increasing expansion of the socialist market is promoting the accelerated development of economic construction in various countries.

    加强兄弟合作互通有无促进经济共同高涨
    世界社会主义市场今年更加繁荣
    许多兄弟国家签订换货议定书贸易额显著增长
    本报综合报道　世界社会主义市场在六十年代的第一年内展现着一片欣欣向荣的景象。
    许多社会主义国家在去年年底和今年年初纷纷签订了1960年的换货协定或议定书，贸易额将比去年大大增长。
    根据各国已经公布的材料，社会主义国家之间今年贸易额的增长额是非常巨大的。例如，罗马尼亚和阿尔巴尼亚今年贸易额将比去年增长近一倍，罗马尼亚和捷克斯洛伐克的贸易额将增长35％，德意志民主共和国和越南民主共和国的贸易额将增长60％，保加利亚和德意志民主共和国的贸易额将增长50％，匈牙利和蒙古的贸易额将增长40％，捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚的贸易额将增长45％。
    同苏联的贸易在各兄弟国家的对外贸易中占着显著的地位。例如，德意志民主共和国和苏联今年的贸易额将达七十五亿卢布，对苏贸易占德意志民主共和国对外贸易总额的45％。根据最近签订的协定，1960—1965年六年内，两国贸易额将达五百亿卢布，这是目前世界上最大的一项贸易协定。波兰和苏联今年的贸易额将达三十亿卢布，比去年有了显著的增长。今年，捷克斯洛伐克对苏联的出口将增加40％，苏联向匈牙利提供的机器将比1958年增加六倍。
    社会主义国家之间的贸易关系充分体现了平等互惠和友好合作的精神。这种贸易是以互通有无、促进经济共同高涨为目的的。各国都向对方提供传统的出口商品，同时进口本国经济建设和人民生活需要的物资。例如，根据今年的换货议定书，工业发达的波兰将向越南民主共和国提供各种类型机器和工业品，帮助越南建立和发展本国工业；越南则向波兰提供大米、油料作物、黄麻等。德意志民主共和国所缺乏的生铁和有色金属全部将由苏联供应，进口石油的95％也是苏联提供的。
    由于德意志民主共和国有着发达的机械工业，苏联所需从外国进口的机械，将有47％由德意志民主共和国供应。
    目前，一些社会主义国家正在举行贸易谈判，以签订1960年的换货协定。
    社会主义市场的日益扩大，促进着各国经济建设加速发展。
