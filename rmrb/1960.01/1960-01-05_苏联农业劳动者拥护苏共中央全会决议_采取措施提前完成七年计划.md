Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 3rd: Soviet agricultural workers in various regions are holding meetings to discuss the resolutions of the December 1959 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee and Khrushchev's speech at the meeting. They unanimously and warmly support the plenary session's resolutions and express their determination to strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan in three or four years ahead of schedule. A campaign to achieve greater successes in agricultural and animal husbandry production in the second year of the Seven-Year Plan is now underway across the country.

Having achieved brilliant results in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, livestock producers throughout the Soviet Union are even more enthusiastic this year. The Ryazan Oblast has decided to sell 180,000 to 200,000 tons of meat to the state this year, an increase of 25% compared to last year. In the Zharashiev District of the Lviv Oblast, collective farm pig farmers are striving to raise 500 pigs each this year, with a cost of no more than 300 rubles per hundred kilograms of pork. The congress of members of the "Path to Communism" collective farm in the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic decided that the farm's meat production in 1960 should fulfill the plan for five years.

The Sverdlovsk Oblast, which was awarded the Order of Lenin, held a mass rally of 150,000 working people's representatives after the closing of the CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session to celebrate the closing of the session and the honor achieved by the oblast. Andrei Kirilenko, First Secretary of the Oblast Party Committee, said at the meeting that the collective farmers and state farm workers of the Sverdlovsk Oblast guarantee to fulfill the Seven-Year Plan for meat production in 1961 and the Seven-Year Plan for milk and egg production in 1962. Livestock workers in Stanislav, Volyn and other oblasts, after discussing the plenary session's resolutions, also guaranteed to complete the Seven-Year Plan in four years.

In the effort to increase grain and other crop production, new targets have also been proposed in various regions, and various measures have been actively taken to strive for a bumper harvest in 1960. Members of the collective farms in the Konstantinov District of the Stalino Oblast have decided to strive to harvest 200 poods of grain per hectare of land in 1960. Many collective farms in Kazakhstan, Siberia, Belarus, Ukraine and other places have universally raised production targets again in discussions.

In order to increase yields per unit area and strive for a bumper grain harvest, various regions expanded the area of winter fallow land in the winter of 1959, paying special attention to the large-scale accumulation of manure and soil fertilizer, seed selection, and the early repair of agricultural machinery. In the fertilizer accumulation campaign launched in various regions, the oblasts of Ukraine and the Russian Federation achieved particularly remarkable results. The amount of soil fertilizer accumulated in various parts of Ukraine currently exceeds that of 1958. Collective farms in the Odessa Oblast have organized hundreds of specialized fertilizer accumulation work teams. In Belarus, more than 50 tractors and more than 2,500 horses are participating in fertilizer accumulation work every day in the Slutsk District of the Minsk Oblast.

Seed selection is also currently underway in various regions. Ukraine and the central regions of the Russian Federation have proposed to use 100% improved seeds. The work of tractor repair stations in various republics to help collective farms repair agricultural machinery has also begun long ago. The agricultural machinery repair tasks in various parts of Ukraine have been completed the fastest. The Dnepropetrovsk Oblast overfulfilled the plan by repairing 500 tractors. In addition, in order to improve spring plowing and sowing techniques, short-term technical training classes have been universally opened in collective farms in various regions, and the broad masses of members have actively participated in learning.

    苏联农业劳动者拥护苏共中央全会决议
    采取措施提前完成七年计划
    新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联各地农业劳动者纷纷举行集会，讨论苏共中央1959年12月全会决议和赫鲁晓夫在会上的讲话。他们一致热烈拥护全会决议，表示要争取提前在三、四年内完成七年计划。现在，为争取在七年计划的第二年农、畜业生产取得更大成就的运动已经在各地展开。
    在七年计划第一年里取得了辉煌成绩的全苏畜牧业生产者，今年劳动热情更为高涨。梁赞州决定在今年交售给国家十八—二十万吨肉类，比去年增多25％。里沃夫州的扎拉什耶夫区的集体农庄每一个养猪员都要争取在今年喂养成五百头猪，并使每百公斤猪肉成本不高于三百卢布。鞑靼自治共和国“共产主义之路”集体农庄庄员大会决定：1960年农庄的肉类生产要完成五个年度的计划。
    荣获列宁勋章的斯维德洛夫斯克州在苏共中央全会闭幕后举行了十五万劳动人民代表的群众大会，庆祝全会闭幕和本州取得的荣誉。州党委第一书记安德烈·基里连科在会上说，斯维德洛夫斯克州集体农民和国营农场的工人，保证在1961年完成肉类生产的七年计划，1962年完成奶类和蛋类生产的七年计划。斯坦尼斯拉夫、沃林等州的畜牧业工作者在讨论全会决议后，也保证在四年内完成七年计划。
    在争取提高谷物和其他作物生产方面，各地也提出了新的指标，并且积极采取了各种措施，争取1960年的丰收。斯大林诺州康斯坦丁诺夫区的集体农庄庄员们决定争取在1960年每公顷土地收获二百普特谷物。哈萨克、西伯利亚、白俄罗斯、乌克兰等地的许多集体农庄在讨论中普遍再次提高了生产指标。
    为提高单位面积产量，争取谷物丰收，1959年冬季各地都扩大了冬翻地面积，特别注意了大量积集粪肥和土肥、选种和及早修理农业机械的工作。在各地掀起的积肥活动中，乌克兰、俄罗斯联邦共和国各州成绩特别显著。乌克兰各地目前所积起的土肥数量都超过了1958年。敖德萨州各集体农庄组织了上百个专门的积肥工作队。在白俄罗斯，明斯克州斯鲁特斯克区现在每天有五十多部拖拉机和二千五百多匹马参加积肥工作。
    目前各地还正在进行选种工作。乌克兰、俄罗斯联邦中部地区都提出要百分之百的使用优良种籽。各共和国拖拉机修理站帮助农庄修理农业机械的工作也早已开始。乌克兰各地的农业机械修理任务完成得最快。第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州超计划多修好了五百台拖拉机。此外，为了提高春耕春播技术，各地集体农庄还普遍开办了短期技术训练班，广大庄员积极参加了学习。
