Pig Raising Enthusiast – Deputy County Head Song Qingping

In the spring of 1958, the Shanghe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party determined that Song Qingping, a member of the county committee and deputy county head, would take the lead in strengthening the leadership of the county's pig raising work. From then on, Comrade Song Qingping wholeheartedly devoted himself to doing a good job in this area. He went deep into pig farms and humbly learned breeding, management, reproduction, and other techniques from experienced old farmers, and also learned medical techniques for treating pig diseases from veterinarians.

By summer, Shanghe County experienced outbreaks of swine enzootic pneumonia and erysipelas, which spread rapidly. Song Qingping rushed to the Tieying Pig Farm and, together with the breeders, finally found the cause of the pig diseases: they were caused by the hot weather and insufficient drinking water. Later, they changed to releasing the pigs in the morning and evening, and frequently providing and increasing the amount of mung bean water and black bean water, which prevented the development of enzootic pneumonia.

In the autumn, the county committee proposed to establish a thousand-head pig farm in the relatively poor Tieying Depression as a model and to create experience. Comrade Song Qingping, filled with confidence, relied on the masses and built the pig farm using simple methods. During the construction, he and the masses worked together to move mud bricks and build pens, fighting continuously for more than ten days. In order to resolutely implement the principle of self-breeding and self-raising, he encouraged the masses to discuss and unify their understanding; at the same time, he organized breeders and mating personnel to learn the experiences of complex and double mating, which greatly improved the reproduction rate of pigs. The farm grew from 340 sows in August 1958 to more than 1,850. In addition to supporting various communes, the more than 800 sows currently in stock are all fully pregnant. The experience of this pig farm has been widely promoted throughout the county, accelerating the development of pig production. In order to solve the feed problem, Comrade Song Qingping led the farm's breeders to find more than ten kinds of feed that can be used to feed pigs, such as Vitex negundo vegetables, green vegetables, tree leaves, and bean leaves. In order to encourage breeders to collect green fodder, reasonable bonus methods were stipulated, and in more than a month, the farm collected more than 400,000 catties of wild fodder.

The masses generally said: County Head Song really has good methods; he not only knows how to raise pigs but is also a "pig raising enthusiast."

    养猪迷——副县长宋清平
    1958年春天，中共山东商河县委确定以县委委员、副县长宋清平为主，加强全县养猪工作的领导。从此，宋清平同志一心一意要搞好这项工作。他深入到养猪场，虚心地向养猪有经验的老农学习饲养、管理、繁殖等技术，还向兽医学习医疗猪病技术。
    到了夏天，商河县发生了猪喘病和丹毒病，蔓延很快。宋清平赶到铁营养猪场，同饲养员一起终于找出了猪病的原因，是因为天热、饮水不足而引起的。后来改为每日早晚放猪，勤饮和多饮绿豆水、黑豆水等，防止了喘病发展。
    秋天，县委提出在比较贫困的铁营洼试办千头养猪场，树立榜样，创造经验。宋清平同志充满信心地依靠群众，采用穷办法兴建起了猪场。在建场中，他和群众一起搬坯砌圈，连续奋战了十几天。为了坚决贯彻自繁自养的方针，他一面发动群众讨论，统一认识；一面组织饲养员、配种员学习复配和双配的经验，使猪的繁殖率大大提高。全场由1958年8月份的三百四十头母猪发展到一千八百五十多头，除支援各个公社外，现在存养的八百多头母猪已全配满怀。这个养猪场的经验，已在全县普遍推广，加速了生猪的发展。为了解决饲料问题，宋清平同志带领全场饲养员，找到了黄荆菜、青菜、树叶、豆叶等十多种可以喂猪的饲料。为了鼓励饲养员采集青饲料，合理规定了超额奖励的办法，一个多月的时间全场就采集了四十多万斤野生饲料。
    群众普遍说：宋县长真有办法，不光会养猪，还是个“养猪迷”。
