Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 24th: According to TASS, the Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on January 23rd entitled "The Seven-Year Plan Advances by Leaps and Bounds."

The editorial pointed out that yesterday, the news that the Soviet national economy had victoriously completed the first year of the Seven-Year Plan and that a powerful Soviet ballistic missile had reached its intended target area in the Pacific Ocean filled every Soviet citizen with a deep sense of patriotic pride. Our country is moving towards communism by leaps and bounds. The magnificent program of communist construction formulated by the 21st Congress of the CPSU is being victoriously realized.

The editorial, in detailing the achievements of the national economic development in 1959, pointed out that Soviet industry had greatly overfulfilled the first year's plan of the Seven-Year Plan. The increase in industrial products in one year was not the originally planned 7.7%, but more than 11%. Among them, the production of means of production increased by 12%, while the production of consumer goods increased by 10.3%. In the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, the average growth rate of industrial products originally planned for the Seven-Year Plan was greatly exceeded. All the union republics and national economic committees overfulfilled their planned tasks.

The editorial pointed out that the first year of the Seven-Year Plan also saw new major achievements in technological progress. This year was the year of the successful launch of the lunar rocket, the year that Soviet scientists uncovered many important secrets of the universe. How precise was the control system of the powerful multi-stage ballistic missile launched into the Pacific region on January 20! This remarkable victory of Soviet science and technology guarantees further progress along the road of mastering outer space and studying the planets of the solar system.

The editorial also stated that the instructions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the June Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee on further developing the overall mechanization and automation of production are being successfully implemented. In 1959, more than two thousand new types of important machines, machinery, instruments, and other equipment were designed and manufactured. The production of more than four hundred extremely important new types of machines, equipment, instruments, and materials was mastered.

The editorial said that the continuous growth of labor productivity most clearly illustrates the extent of our progress towards communism. In 1959, the plan for this decisive indicator was overfulfilled in industry and construction. Over the year, labor productivity in industry increased by 7.4%, and in construction by 9%. The task of reducing the cost of industrial products has also been overfulfilled.

The editorial continued by saying that despite unfavorable weather conditions last year, agricultural laborers have achieved brilliant successes. Last year, the total grain harvest exceeded the average annual harvest of 1954-1958 by 700 million poods, and exceeded the average annual harvest of 1949-1953 by 2.7 billion poods. Cotton production was higher than at any time in the entire history of our cotton planting industry.

Animal husbandry is steadily advancing. The Soviet Union's total milk production caught up with the United States in 1958, and surpassed the United States in 1959: the Soviet Union produced 62 million tons of milk, while the United States produced nearly 57 million tons.

As for animal oil, our country has surpassed the United States not only in total output, but also in per capita output: the Soviet Union produced 845,000 tons of animal oil in 1959, or 4 kilograms per capita, while the United States, including the oil processed by farmers themselves, produced 658,000 tons, or 3.7 kilograms per capita.

The editorial said that capital construction in 1959 reached an unprecedented scale. In one year, more than 1,000 large industrial enterprises were put into production, and many new workshops were also put into production in existing enterprises.

The vigorous development of various sectors of the socialist economy ensures the continuous improvement of the material welfare of the people and the improvement of the cultural level of the people's lives. In just over a year, the Soviet national income, which belongs entirely to the working people, increased by about 100 billion rubles. More than 13 million workers and staff members have already transitioned to a shortened workday. The editorial concluded by pointing out that our Seven-Year Plan has had a good start! The heroic labor of the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party is the guarantee for the victorious completion of the second year's tasks of the Seven-Year Plan and the early realization of the great Seven-Year Plan!

    七年计划大踏步迈进
    苏联“真理报”一月二十三日社论摘要
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”23日发表了题为“七年计划大踏步迈进”的社论。
    社论指出，昨天，苏联国民经济胜利完成七年计划第一年的计划和威力强大的苏联弹道火箭达到太平洋的预定地区的消息，使每一个苏联人充满深刻的爱国自豪感。我国大踏步地向共产主义前进。苏共第二十一次代表大会所拟定的、宏伟的共产主义建设纲领正在胜利地实现中。
    社论在详细论述1959年国民经济发展的成就时指出，苏联工业大大超额完成了七年计划的第一年计划。工业产品一年中间的增长额不是原订计划的7．7％，而是11％以上。其中生产资料的生产增长了12％，而消费资料的生产增长了10．3％。在七年计划的第一年，七年计划原订的工业产品平均增长速度就大大被超过了。所有的加盟共和国和国民经济委员会都超额完成了计划任务。
    社论指出，七年计划的第一年在技术进步方面也获得了新的重大成就，这一年是月球火箭发射成功的一年、是苏联科学家揭开了许多宇宙中的重要秘密的一年。1月20日往太平洋地区发射的威力强大的多级弹道火箭的操纵系统的准确度是多么的高呵！苏联科学技术的这个卓越的胜利保证可以沿着掌握宇宙空间和研究太阳系行星的道路上进一步向前迈进。
    社论又说，苏共第二十一次代表大会和苏共中央六月全会关于进一步发展生产全盘机械化和自动化的指示正在顺利实现。1959年设计并制成了两千多种新类型的重要机器、机械、仪器和其他设备。掌握了四百多种极重要的新型机器、设备、仪器和材料的生产。
    社论说，劳动生产率的不断增长最明显地说明了我们向共产主义迈进的幅度。1959年这一决定性指标的计划在工业和建筑业方面已经超额完成。一年来，在工业方面劳动生产率增长了7．4％，在建筑业方面增长了9％。关于降低工业产品成本的任务也已经超额完成。
    社论接着说，尽管去年气候条件不利，农业劳动者还是取得了辉煌成就。去年，谷物总收获量超过1954—1958年年平均收获量七亿普特，超过1949—1953年年平均收获量二十七亿普特。棉花的生产比我国植棉业发展的整个历史中任何时期都多。
    畜牧业在稳步前进。苏联奶类总产量在1958年就赶上了美国，而在1959年就把美国抛在后面了：苏联生产六千二百万吨奶类，而美国生产约近五千七百万吨。
    至于动物油，我国不仅在总的产量方面，并且在按人口平均计算的产量方面也超过了美国：苏联在1959年生产了八十四万五千吨动物油，即按人口平均计算每人四公斤，而在美国包括农民自己加工的油脂在内是六十五万八千吨，即按人口平均计算每人三点七公斤。
    社论说，1959年的基本建设达到了空前的规模。在一年之内就有一千多个大型工业企业投入生产，在原有企业中，也有许多新的车间投入生产。
    社会主义经济各个部门的蓬勃发展保证人民物质福利不断提高，人民生活的文化水平的提高。仅在一年多的时间内，完全属于劳动人民的苏联国民收入约增加了一千亿卢布。一千三百多万职工已经过渡到了缩短的工作日。社论最后指出，我们的七年计划已经有了一个良好的开端！苏联人民在共产党领导下所从事的英雄劳动是胜利完成七年计划第二年任务和提前实现伟大的七年计划的保证！
