A Good Housekeeper for the Masses
——The Experience of the Shijingpo Trading Store in Chongqing in Organizing the People's Economic Life
Gan Weiniu
The Shijingpo Trading Store is a red banner in Chongqing's commercial system for organizing the economic life of people in industrial and mining areas. This store has developed a set of working methods that are now being widely promoted in all industrial and mining area trading stores, street comprehensive stores, and key school and people's commune supply departments throughout the city.
Everything for Production, Convenience Everywhere for the Masses
The Shijingpo Trading Store is a regional comprehensive retail store. It is responsible for supplying the living needs of tens of thousands of workers and their families at a steel plant in Chongqing. Pure commercial and catering service personnel account for only 0.6% of the supplied population. Under the guidance of the thought of "taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward," they have vigorously supported steel production in recent years.
The method of the Shijingpo Trading Store to organize the economic life of the people in the industrial and mining area is: grasp the characteristics of the work, grasp the key targets, grasp the service network, and combine business to develop non-staple food production. By grasping these key points, a lot of work has been driven forward.

The "More, Good, Long, Complete" Supply Method
The supply work in industrial and mining areas has four major characteristics: wide factory area and dispersed worker residences; workers are busy with production and only buy things when they have free time; higher purchasing power; three-shift production with day and night supply needs. In response to these four major characteristics, they have adopted the "More, Good, Long, Complete" supply method accordingly.
More: More commercial points, more consignment stores, and more temporary supply points. Wherever there is a need, there is a supply point. Since the Great Leap Forward, the store has added 39 business outlets, bringing the total to 62 including the original ones; and the central store has assigned salespersons to set up 6 distribution stores in the construction site and the concentrated location of workers. At the same time, workers' families were organized to set up 23 consignment stores; hawkers were added for mobile supply, and telephone ordering services were opened. In this way, a network of commercial points has been formed in the factory area, and workers and their families can buy what they need without leaving the village.
Good: Good rational allocation of goods and good service attitude. In terms of rational allocation of goods, they do everything possible to ensure the supply of goods needed by special operations workers such as high-temperature workshops and health canteens, in accordance with the principles of guaranteeing key points, taking care of special needs, giving priority to collectives, and arranging for general needs. The needs of lying-in women and patients are also taken care of. In the usual distribution of goods, the methods of delimiting areas and designating points, contracting by sections, delivering goods to homes, and distributing to individuals are adopted to ensure timely supply and satisfaction of the masses. For example, during the National Day last year, they delivered more than a dozen kinds of dried vegetable and non-staple foods to consumers, totaling more than 30,000 packages. In order to do a good job in the rational allocation of goods, they adopted many methods to understand the consumption habits of the masses from various aspects, and achieved "six knows" and "seven familiarities." "Six knows" means knowing the population, knowing the number of households, knowing southerners and northerners, knowing the maternity period of pregnant women, knowing ethnic minorities, and knowing revolutionary martyrs' families. "Seven familiarities" means being familiar with the situation of the lonely, old, sick, disabled, young, old workers, and old engineering and technical personnel. An old worker was ill and needed proper nutrition, but no one took care of him. After the restaurant waiter knew about it, he delivered food to him for more than a month. The old worker said with emotion: "You are even closer than my relatives." In terms of service attitude, in the spirit of "rather trouble ourselves a thousand times than let customers feel a little inconvenience," they implemented commodity returns and exchanges, and commodities were sold in retail, even a needle and a thread were sold. In special circumstances, they try their best to meet the needs of consumers. For example, once the factory's employee hospital urgently needed a white nylon raincoat for insulation to rescue a scalded patient. At that time, the store had no stock. In order to rescue the wounded, the store immediately sent people to the city, and searched through fifty or sixty large and small stores for four hours, and finally bought the raincoat at a consignment shop.
Long: Long business hours, supplying whenever there is a need. In order to adapt to the characteristics of the factory's three-shift production, they implemented all-day business hours. Among them, the department store and non-staple food store were open for 12 hours. The salespersons adopted the method of changing shifts, going into battle together when busy, and resting in turn when idle. The stores that sell cigarettes, alcohol, candy, and pastries at major intersections are open from 6:30 in the morning to 12:00 at night. The workshop cafeteria is open when workers go to and from work, and is open four times a day. The workers are very satisfied.
Complete: Complete variety of goods and complete service items. They operated more than 11,000 kinds of commodities last year, an increase of 57% compared with 1958; the service items increased by 51 kinds. From silks and satins to scallions, garlic, baskets, brooms, carrying poles, photography, washing and dyeing, repairing pots, repairing bowls, refurbishment, repairing old items, shoe repair, umbrella repair, everything is available for daily life.

Canteens in Workshops, Stalls by Furnaces
The key target of Shijingpo Store's supply is steelworkers. Workshops and furnace sides are steelworkers' activity bases. The store's supply work penetrates into the workshops and furnace sides. Their approach is:
Establish workshop canteens: Large restaurants will assign chefs and waiters to set up points in the workshops, supplying noodles, rice, and dishes day and night, and also steam rice and dishes for workers. Workers can not only buy chicken, fish, eggs, seafood and other foods nearby, but also the food is of good quality, sufficient quantity, and cheap price. They have successively established four workshop canteens, and the turnover accounts for more than half of the store's catering turnover. In the past, workers had to run a mile or two to eat in large restaurants, but now they can eat nearby, whenever they want. In the past, night shift workers could not buy anything to eat, but now they can eat delicious food in the middle of the night. This approach facilitates the masses and shortens workers' non-production time.
Establish workshop service departments: Utilizing the houses and equipment of workshop canteens, they supply cigarettes, candies, pastries, fruits, canned food, etc. day and night. At the same time, in coordination with the factory's high-yield and maintenance tasks, they organize mobile service teams to go deep into construction sites, workshops, and furnace sides to supply. The store sends people to take turns supplying workers during three-shift production.
Carry out consolation supply: For workshops, teams, groups and individuals who adhere to production during festivals and successfully complete their plans in the high-yield movement, they actively send better food and consumer goods to encourage workers' enthusiasm for production. In the recent high-yield movement, several steelmaking and rolling workshops overfulfilled their plans, so they organized three consolation teams respectively, bringing the store's employees' consolation letters and the best cigarettes, candies, and pastries, led by the branch secretary, manager, and union chairman, and delivered them to the workshops with gongs and drums. This greatly encouraged the workers, and some people on the spot expressed that they would create new achievements to respond to the support of commercial employees.

Organizing Employees' Family Members to Participate in Service Work
Since the Great Leap Forward, employees' family members who have labor force have participated in work, and 2,500 family members have participated in work in the factory area. Therefore, many people lack management of housework, and many household chores such as washing clothes and drinking water have become social problems. In response to this situation, the store has taken the following approaches:
Establish organizations for the masses to manage their own lives: The store, together with the factory union, the town people's committee, and the worker and family committee, established a factory internal people's economic life committee, and economic life groups were set up in various sections. Under the unified leadership of the Party, the masses are organized to manage their own lives.
Consolidate and improve family canteens: On the one hand, the store adopts the methods of "one contract" and "three coordination" for factory canteens ("one contract" means that the store contracts to supply non-staple foods, and "three coordination" means cooperating with the factory canteen in terms of business hours, business locations, and variety of dishes) to improve the supply work of restaurants; on the other hand, it adopts the method of "five helps" for family-run canteens, that is, helping canteens establish necessary systems, helping to improve cooking skills, helping to solve tools and equipment, helping to solve the source of non-staple foods (giving appropriate care in the allocation of non-staple food sources), and helping to develop poultry and livestock. This has greatly improved the quality of meals, and the number of people dining has greatly increased. At present, 14,000 people are dining in nine family canteens, an increase of 75% compared with 1958.
Establish family consignment stores: With the expansion of the factory, new family areas have gradually formed. In addition to adding some business points by itself, the store organized factory area family members to establish 23 consignment stores in remote areas, operating non-staple foods and some daily-use department store sundries. Consignment sellers are generally employees' family members who are engaged in housework, and the store gives them a 1% handling fee according to the sales volume. These consignment stores make up for the lack of supply points and facilitate the masses.
Establish family service departments: Through the town people's committee, organize old and weak residents with more difficult lives to participate in service industry work such as washing clothes, mending old clothes, shining shoes, making sock bottoms, putting on socks, and hair cutting. At present, four section area family service departments have been organized, with a total of 13 service groups and 124 service personnel. The income of the family service department, except for 5% submitted to the state, is used as the salary of the staff and the expenditure for purchasing utensils.
Establish section area mutual aid groups: On the basis of the section area people's economic life group, the store further organized mutual aid groups to solve trivial matters in the lives of the masses. Such as purchasing goods on behalf of others, carrying patients and lying-in women, cleaning, assisting in handling weddings and funerals, and taking care of children. This organization is entirely mutual aid in nature and does not give any remuneration. Up to now, 51 mutual aid groups have been organized, and about 500 workers' family members have participated.

Combine Business to Develop Non-Staple Food Production
According to the central government's policy of developing non-staple food production, Shijingpo Store has combined business to carry out non-staple food production activities centered on pig raising. Now it has raised more than 1,700 pigs and 6,500 poultry; and assisted public canteens and residents in raising more than 300 pigs, and jointly raised and helped employees' families raise more than 20,000 poultry with the commune. At present, the average employee's family in the factory area raises more than five chickens. Due to the great development of livestock and poultry, the supply of non-staple foods in the factory area has been greatly improved.

Strengthen Ideological Education to Establish Correct Views
The store's Party organization regularly conducts education on political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints for employees, requiring employees to think about the masses everywhere and at all times, and to make economic work more and more detailed. The content of the education includes five aspects:
Situation education: The main thing is to educate employees to realize that the development trend of the entire economy is higher and higher, the masses have great enthusiasm, and production is leaping higher and higher; this requires the commercial sector to arrange the economic life of the masses well. At the same time, with the continuous development of production, the purchasing power of the masses is increasing day by day, and they require not only more and more quantity of various commodities, but also better and better quality. Therefore, commercial workers must take the first step in organizing the economic life of the people, understand the needs of the masses in a timely manner, understand the feelings of the masses, and make their work better and better.
Education on the socialist commercial nature: Educate employees to realize that the relationship between socialist commerce and the people is not a simple buying and selling relationship, but a relationship of mutual assistance and service. Commercial workers serve the masses; similarly, the masses also serve commercial workers from different positions. Therefore, commercial personnel must abandon all remaining capitalist trading methods and give full play to the role that socialist commerce should play in the national economy.
Education on the mass line: Educate employees to realize that the mass line is the fundamental line of commercial work. From the close relationship between commercial work and the masses, commercial work is both economic work and political work. Therefore, commercial workers must have a firm mass viewpoint and in-depth and meticulous working methods in order to make their work deep into the masses and deep into reality.
Education on the overall viewpoint: Educate employees to realize that commercial work has strong policy and a wide range of involvement. When looking at problems, they must proceed from an overall perspective, not only see the temporary, but also see the long-term; not only see the local, but also see the whole. The arrangement of the economic life of the masses must be carried out under the premise of strictly increasing production and practicing economy. Neither can we put aside the livelihood issues that should and can be helped by the masses in the name of increasing production and practicing economy; nor can we cause waste in the name of arranging livelihoods.
Education on comprehensive cooperation: The main thing is to educate employees to realize that strengthening comprehensive cooperation is an important method to do a good job in commercial work. In handling collective welfare undertakings of the masses, some are mainly carried out by the commercial sector, and some are supplemented by the commercial sector; the main and auxiliary are only the distinction in degree, and more importantly, the commercial sector plays a connecting role in this regard. Commercial employees should consciously recognize this role, promote the spirit of great collaboration to all parties, and twist all the forces that can be used together in order to solve various problems in the economic life of the masses in a timely manner.
The store's Party organization regards these five aspects of education as a regular political and ideological work, and constantly deepens employees' understanding in combination with various movements, which has effectively promoted various business work.
In carrying out various business work, Shijingpo Store has done a more systematic and regular job on the working methods of relying on the organization and implementing the mass line. Their experience can be summarized as "three relies" and "five connections." "Three relies": First, rely on the leadership of the factory Party committee. Major matters are reported to the Party committee in advance to seek the support of the Party committee; work plans and summary documents are reported to the Party committee for review, requesting instructions from the Party committee; actively strive to participate in relevant meetings of the Party committee to understand the central work in order to cooperate. Second, rely on the masses and fully mobilize the strength of workers and their families. Third, rely on the cooperation of the people's communes to organize a large number of non-staple foods to meet the needs of employees' lives. "Five connections": (1) Connect with the factory headquarters to actively do a good job in the supply of life and related production materials; (2) Connect with the factory union to do a good job in the supply of labor protection and health care items; and solicit workers' opinions through the union, publicize commodity policies, and do a good job in industrial and commercial cooperation. (3) Connect with the factory Communist Youth League and rely on young workers to help the store complete some assault tasks. For example, when carrying out technological innovation last year, the installation of the conveyor belt was short of more than 400 wooden pivot centers, which were rushed out by the young workers in the Second Workshop. (4) Connect with workshops and sections, go deep into workshops and construction sites to do a good job in supply, and strive for their leadership over the restaurants and service points in the workshops and construction sites. (5) Connect with the family committee to jointly organize the economic life of the residents in the residential area.

    群众的好管家人
    ——重庆市石井坡贸易商店组织人民经济生活的经验 
    甘为牛
    石井坡贸易商店是重庆市商业系统组织工矿区人民经济生活的一面红旗。这个商店摸索出了一套工作方法，目前正在全市所有的工矿区贸易商店、街道综合商店以及重点学校和人民公社的供应部门普遍推广。一切为了生产处处便利群众
    石井坡贸易商店是一个地区性综合零售商店。它负责供应重庆一个钢铁厂数万名职工和家属的生活需要。全店纯商业和饮食服务人员只占供应人口的0．6％。在“以钢为纲、全面跃进”的思想指导下，几年来，他们有力地支持了钢铁生产。
    石井坡贸易商店组织工矿区人民经济生活的方法是：抓工作特点、抓重点对象、抓服务网，结合业务发展副食品生产。抓住了这几条纲，很多工作都带动起来了。
  “多、好、长、全”的供应方法
    工矿区的供应工作有四大特点：厂区范围广，职工住宅分散；工人生产忙，买东西都是忙里抽闲；购买力较高；三班制生产，日夜需要供应。针对这四大特点，他们相应地采取了
  “多、好、长、全”的供应方法。
    多：是商业点多、代销店多、临时供应点多，哪里有需要，哪里就有供应点。大跃进以来，商店先后增设了营业点三十九个，连原有的共达六十二个；并由中心门市部抽出营业员在工地和工人集中地点设立了六个分销店。同时，还组织工人家属设立了代销店二十三个；增设货郎担流动供应，开办电话购货业务。这样，在厂区内就形成了星罗棋布的商业网，职工和家属不出村段就可以买到需要的东西。
    好：是商品合理分配好，服务态度好。在合理分配商品方面，他们按照保证重点、照顾特殊、集体优先、安排一般的原则，对高温车间等特种作业工人和保健食堂所需的商品，想尽办法保证供应。对产妇和病号的需要也有所照顾。平时分配商品，采取划片定点、分段包干、送货到家、分配到人的办法，做到供应及时，群众满意。如去年国庆节期间，他们送到消费者手里的干菜副食品就有十几种，共三万多包。为了做好商品合理分配工作，他们采取很多办法，对群众的消费习惯作了多方的了解，做到了“六知”和“七熟”。“六知”就是知人口、知户数，知南方人北方人、知孕妇分娩期、知少数民族、知烈军属。“七熟”就是熟悉孤、老、病、残、幼、老工人、老工程技术人员的情况。一位老工人生病，需要适当营养，但无人照顾。餐厅招待员知道以后，就连续一个多月给他送菜饭。老工人感动地说：“你真比亲人还亲。”在服务态度方面，他们本着“宁愿自己麻烦千遍，不让顾客稍感不便”的精神，实行商品包调回换，商品分零，一针一线都出售。遇到特殊情况，更是千方百计地满足消费者的需要。如有一次厂里职工医院急救一位烫伤病人，深夜急需一件白尼龙雨衣作隔绝用。当时商店无货，为了急救伤员，这个商店立即派人进城，走遍五、六十家大小商店，寻找了四个多钟头，终于在一家委托行里买到了雨衣。
    长：就是营业时间长，做到什么时候需要，什么时候供应。为了适应工厂生产三班制的特点，他们实行了全天营业。其中百货和副食品门市部营业十二小时，营业员采取换班的办法，忙时一齐上阵，闲时轮流休息。在主要路口经营烟、酒、糖果、糕点的门市部，从早上六点半到深夜十二时营业。车间餐厅在工人上下班时营业，每天开门营业四次。工人们都很满意。
    全：就是商品品种全，服务项目全。他们去年经营的商品有一万一千多种，比1958年增加57％；服务项目增加了五十一种。从绸缎到葱蒜，罗兜，扫把，簸箕，扁担，照相，洗染，补锅，补碗，翻新，补旧，尚鞋，补伞，凡是生活需要，样样具全。
    车间设餐厅　炉边摆货摊
    石井坡商店供应的重点对象是钢铁工人。车间和炉旁是钢铁工人的活动基地，商店供应工作就深入到车间、炉旁。他们的作法是：
    设立车间餐厅：由大型餐厅抽出厨师和招待员到车间设点，日夜供应面点饭菜，并代工人蒸饭蒸菜。工人不仅可以就近买到鸡、鱼、蛋、海味等食物，而且饭菜质好量足，价钱便宜。他们先后设立了四个车间餐厅，营业额占商店饮食业营业总额的一半以上。以前工人到大餐厅吃饭，要跑一两里路，现在可以就近吃饭，随到随吃。以前夜班工人买不到东西吃，现在半夜也可以吃到可口的东西。这种做法方便了群众，缩短了工人的非生产时间。
    设立车间服务部：利用车间餐厅的房屋和设备，日夜供应香烟、糖果、糕点、水果、罐头等。同时配合厂里高产、检修等突击任务，组织流动服务组深入工地、车间、炉旁供应。工人三班生产，商店就派人轮流供应。
    开展慰问供应：对节日坚持生产和在高产运动中出色完成计划的车间、班、组和个人，他们主动送去较好的吃食和消费品，鼓励工人的生产积极性。在最近的高产运动中，几个炼钢、轧钢车间超额完成了计划，他们就分别组织三个慰问队，带着商店职工的慰问信和最好的香烟、糖果、糕点，由支部书记、经理、工会主席带头，敲锣打鼓送到车间出售。这对工人鼓舞很大，当场就有人表示要创造新的成就回答商业职工的支持。
  组织职工家属参加服务工作
    大跃进以来，有劳动力的职工家属都参加了工作，厂区内参加工作的家属达二千五百人。因此有不少人的家务缺人管理，很多家务琐事如洗衣、喝水等变成了社会问题。针对这一情况，商店采取了以下的作法：
    建立群众自己管理生活的组织：由商店会同厂工会、镇人民委员会、工属委员会成立了厂内人民经济生活委员会，各地段设经济生活小组。在党的统一领导下，组织群众自己管理自己的生活。
    巩固和提高家属伙食团：商店一方面对工厂食堂采取“一包”、“三配合”（“一包”即商店包干供应副食品，“三配合”即在营业时间、营业地点、菜的花色品种上与工厂食堂配合）的办法，改进餐厅的供应工作；另一方面对家属民办食堂采取“五帮”的办法，即帮助食堂建立必要的制度，帮助提高烹调技术，帮助解决工具设备，帮助解决副食品货源（在分配副食品货源上给予适当照顾），和帮助发展家禽家畜。这样就大大提高了伙食质量，搭伙人数大大增加。现在九个家属食堂搭伙的已有一万四千人，比1958年增加75％。
    成立家属代销店：随着工厂扩建，新的家属区逐渐形成。商店除了自己增加一些营业点以外，组织厂区家属在偏僻地区成立了二十三个代销店，经营副食品和部分日用百货杂品。代销员一般都是从事家务劳动的职工家属，由商店照销货额给以1％的手续费。这些代销店弥补了供应点的不足，便利了群众。
    成立家属服务部：通过镇人民委员会组织生活较为困难的老弱居民参加洗衣、缝补旧衣物、擦皮鞋、做袜底、上袜子、理发等服务行业的工作。目前已组织了段区家属服务部四个，共有服务小组十三个，服务人员一百二十四人。家属服务部的收入除5％上交国家以外，其余作为本人工资和添置用具的开支。
    成立段区互助组：商店在段区人民经济生活小组的基础上，进一步组织了互助组，解决群众生活中的琐事。如代购商品，抬送病人和产妇，打扫清洁，协助办理红白喜事，代管小孩等。这种组织全属互助性质，不给任何报酬。到目前为止，已组织了五十一个互助组，工人家属参加的共有五百人左右。
  结合业务发展
  副食品生产
    石井坡商店根据中央发展副食品生产的方针，结合业务开展了以养猪为中心的副食品生产活动。现在已养生猪一千七百多头，养家禽六千五百只；并协助公共食堂和居民养猪三百多头，同公社合养和帮助职工家属饲养家禽两万多只。现在厂区职工平均每户养鸡五只以上。由于禽畜的大发展，厂区副食品供应情况有了很大的改善。加强思想教育树立正确观点
    商店党组织经常对职工进行政治观点、生产观点、群众观点的教育，要求职工处处为群众着想，时时为群众着想，把经济工作愈做愈细。教育的内容包括五个方面：
    形势教育：主要是教育职工认识到整个经济的发展形势是一浪高一浪的，群众的干劲很大，生产愈跃愈高；这就更需要商业部门安排好群众的经济生活。同时，随着生产的不断发展，群众购买力日益提高，对各种商品不仅要求数量愈来愈多，而且要求质量愈来愈好。因此，商业工作人员组织人民经济生活就要先走一步，及时了解群众需要，体会群众心情，把工作越作越好。
    社会主义商业性质的教育：教育职工认识到社会主义商业与人民群众之间的来往不是单纯的买卖关系，而是一种互助服务的关系。商业工作人员为群众服务；同样，群众也从不同岗位上为商业工作人员服务。因此，商业人员必须扔掉一切残存的资本主义买卖方式，充分发挥社会主义商业在国民经济中应起的作用。
    群众路线的教育：教育职工认识到群众路线是商业工作的根本路线。从商业工作与群众的密切关系来说，商业工作既是经济工作，也是政治工作。因此，商业工作者要有牢固的群众观点和深入细致的工作方法，才能使工作深入群众、深入实际。
    全面观点的教育：教育职工认识到商业工作的政策性强，牵连面广，看问题一定要从全面出发，既要看到暂时的，更要看到长远的；既要看到局部的，更要看到整体的。安排群众经济生活必须在厉行增产节约的前提下进行，既不能借口增产节约把应当而且可以帮助群众解决的生活问题放在一边；也不能借口安排生活而造成浪费。
    全面协作的教育：主要是教育职工认识到加强全面协作是搞好商业工作的重要方法。在办理群众集体福利事业中，有些是以商业部门为主，有些以商业部门为辅；主与辅只是程度上的区分，更重要的是商业部门在这方面所起的串连作用。商业职工应当自觉地认识到这种作用，把大协作的精神推之于各方，把一切可以运用的力量拧在一起，以求及时地解决群众经济生活中的各种问题。
    商店党组织把这五方面的教育，作为一项经常的政治思想工作，结合各种运动不断加深职工认识，有力地推动了各项业务工作。
    石井坡商店在进行各项业务工作中，对依靠组织和贯彻群众路线的工作方法，做得比较系统、经常。他们的经验概括来说，就是“三靠”、“五联”。“三靠”：第一，依靠工厂党委领导，重大事情事先向党委汇报，争取党委支持；工作计划和总结文件报党委审查，请求党委指示；主动争取参加党委有关会议，了解中心工作，以便配合。第二，依靠群众，充分调动工人和家属的力量。第三，依靠人民公社的协作，组织大批副食品满足职工生活的需要。“五联”：（1）联系工厂厂部，积极作好生活及有关生产资料的供应；（2）联系工厂工会，作好劳动保护、保健物品的供应工作；并通过工会征求工人意见，宣传商品政策，搞好工商协作。（3）联系工厂共青团，依靠青年工人帮助商店完成一些突击性任务。如去年搞技术革新时，安装传送带差四百多个木轴心，就是二车间的青年工人帮助突击车出来的。（4）联系车间、科室，深入车间、工地作好供应，同时争取他们对车间、工地的餐厅和服务点进行领导。（5）联系家属委员会，共同组织好居民段群众的经济生活。
