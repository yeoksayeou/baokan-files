Lanzhou, January 6th (By our newspaper) - The machinery industry departments of Gansu Province have achieved great success in helping agriculture with technological transformation.

Now, Gansu Province has 226 machinery factories above the county level, including more than 80 agricultural machinery factories specifically serving agriculture, averaging more than two agricultural machinery factories per county. The province has more than 3,700 commune-run farm tool manufacturing and repair factories that have been consolidated, averaging six to seven per commune. The vast majority of these factories were developed at high speed in the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and the continuing leap forward of 1959, using the method of "walking on two legs." According to incomplete statistics, by the end of November 1959, the machinery manufacturing plants above the county level in the province had produced more than 650,000 sixteen-inch mountain plows, more than 50,000 seven-inch walking plows, more than 23,000 Liberation-style waterwheels, more than 4,000 seven-row and twelve-row seeders, more than 1,300 various water pumps, 4,300 horsepower of power machinery, and more than 100 mixed sets of tractors. The main product varieties reached more than 120 kinds. This provides good conditions for Gansu Province to realize the technological transformation of agriculture.

The main characteristics of Gansu Province's industrial support for agricultural technological transformation are:

First, keep an eye on mechanization, focus on semi-mechanization and improved farm tools; first develop the most seasonal machinery that has the greatest effect on agricultural production, and gradually achieve mechanization of multiple operations; start with reliable and relatively mature machinery, and then actively create conditions to achieve more complex operations. In line with this spirit, the province created and promoted more than 5 million pieces of new and improved farm tools for irrigation and drainage, harvesting, threshing, transportation, sowing, and processing in 1958 and 1959 alone. According to surveys in Linxia and Zhangye prefectures, these farm tools generally increase work efficiency by two to three times. Pingliang Prefecture promoted more than 2.6 million improved farm tools, which can save nearly 200 million workdays throughout the year, equivalent to 70% of the total annual labor input.

Second, use indigenous methods, and turn local resources into foreign equipment. In 1957, Gansu Province had only more than 1,600 metal cutting machine tools. After October 1958, a mass machine tool manufacturing movement was launched throughout the province, and more than 1,700 machine tools were produced in a short period of two months. By last November, the province had manufactured more than 3,300 machine tools. The number of "foreign" machine tools increased several times, greatly improving the modern technical foundation. In 1958, the total output value of modern industry in the machinery industry above the county level increased by 2.2 times compared with 1957, and the total capacity of power machinery increased by 3.4 times compared with 1957. After the consolidation and improvement in 1959, the "small indigenous groups" in the province's machinery industry have generally risen to "small foreign groups" and "medium foreign groups." All factories above the county level have been transformed into modern industries. This provides a strong material basis for supporting agricultural technological transformation in the future.

Third, while producing a large number of farm tools to support agriculture, we also try our best to provide equipment to help communes establish their own industries. In 1959, the machinery industry departments of Gansu Province had organized various technical workers to go deep into the rural areas twice throughout the province to help communes run various agricultural technology training classes, provide technical materials, assist commune-run industries in solving many major technical problems, repair various farm tools, and support communes with various equipment and manpower. Last year, the machinery factories in the Lanzhou area alone supported commune-run factories with 308 simple machine tools. In the first quarter of 1959, the province produced more than 5,000 simple machine tools, all of which armed the county and commune farm tool factories. In the second half of this year, the products manufactured by several large machinery factories in Lanzhou using waste materials, edge materials, and scraps for agricultural services reached more than 1,800 tons. Many machinery industry departments generally established contact with one or several people's communes and vigorously supported agriculture with technical equipment. This has enabled the commune-run machinery industry to play a strong role in agricultural technological transformation.

    抓改良农具　抓季节性最强对农业增产作用最大的机械
    甘肃机械工业大力支援农业
    本报兰州6日电　甘肃省的机械工业部门帮助农业进行技术改造，取得了很大的成绩。
    现在，甘肃全省已经拥有县属以上的机械工厂二百二十六个，其中专门为农业服务的农业机械厂八十多个，平均每个县有二个以上的农业机械厂。全省已有经过整顿的人民公社社办农具制造和修配工厂三千七百多个，平均每个公社有六至七个。上述这些工厂，绝大部分是在大跃进的1958年和继续跃进的1959年用两条腿走路的办法高速度发展起来的。据不完全的统计，到1959年11月底，全省县属以上的机械制造厂已经制成的产品计有十六号山地犁六十五万多部，七吋步犁五万多部，解放式水车二万三千多部，七行和十二行播种机四千多部，各种水泵一千三百多台，动力机械四千三百多马力，拖拉机一百多混合台。主要产品品种达到一百二十多种。这给甘肃省实现农业技术改造提供了良好的条件。
    甘肃省工业支援农业技术改造过程中，主要特点是：
    第一，眼看机械化，手抓半机械化和改良农具；先搞季节性最强。对农业增产作用最大的机械，逐步达到多项作业机械化；先从有把握的、较成熟的机械开始，再积极创造条件，实现更复杂的作业项目。本着这个精神，全省仅1958年和1959年，就创造推广了排灌、收割、脱粒、运输、播种、加工等新式农具和改良农具五百多万件。据临夏和张掖等几个专区的调查，这些农具一般都提高工效两三倍。平凉专区推广了二百六十多万件改良农具，全年可节省劳动日近两亿多个，相当于全年总用工量的70％。
    第二，土法上马，土里出洋。1957年甘肃全省只有金属切削机床一千六百多台，1958年10月以后，全省展开群众性的大造机床运动，在短短的两个月间，生产了机床一千七百多台。到去年11月，全省又制造出机床三千三百多台。“洋”机床成倍增加，大大提高了现代化的技术基础。1958年县属以上的机械工业中，现代化工业的总产值比1957年增长了二点二倍，动力机械总能力比1957年增长了三点四倍。经过1959年的整顿和提高，全省机械工业中的“小土群”已经普遍上升为“小洋群”和“中洋群”。全部县属以上的工厂，已经全部变成现代化工业。这为今后支援农业技术改造提供了强有力的物质基础。
    第三，既生产大批农具支援农业，又千方百计地提供设备，帮助公社建立自己的工业。1959年甘肃省的机械工业部门已经在全省范围内两次组织各种技术工人深入农村，帮助公社举办各种农业技术训练班，提供技术资料，协助社办工业解决许多重大的技术问题，修理各种农具，以各种设备和人力支援公社。光是兰州地区的机械工厂去年支援社办工厂的简易机床就有三百零八台。1959年第一季度，全省又生产简易机床五千多台，全部武装了县、社农具厂。今年下半年，仅兰州的几个大型机械厂利用废料、边料、下角料制造出来的为农业服务的产品即达一千八百多吨。许多机械工业部门普遍固定和一个或几个人民公社建立联系，从技术设备上大力支援农业。这样就使得社办的机械工业在农业技术改造中发挥了强有力的作用。（附图片）
