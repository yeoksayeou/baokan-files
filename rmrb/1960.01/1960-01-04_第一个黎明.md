    The First Dawn
    By our reporters Bai Linzai and Sun Minghui
    Midnight. As the chimes announcing the arrival of the New Year rang out, the steel warriors of Anshan Iron and Steel, full of vigor, threw themselves into the battle of the New Year.
    Tonight, Anshan Iron and Steel was filled with an even more intense fighting atmosphere. More than an hour before their shift started, workers surged to the production site like a tide. Batch after batch of molten steel and iron dyed the sky red, and the thick black, yellowish-brown, and milky-white smoke filling the air was especially beautiful. "The first heat of rapid steelmaking in the New Year has been produced!", "The first heat of molten steel was produced ahead of schedule!", "A new record for rapid steel rolling has been created!"—one good news report after another, accompanied by deafening gongs and drums and the sound of firecrackers, spread from various workshops, filling the steel capital night with a scene of victory and joy.
    Two Heroes Compete Before the Furnace
    From midnight onwards, the first joint technical performance competition week of 1960 began at Anshan Iron and Steel's various factories and mines. The night shift workers of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant held a mobilization meeting before entering the competition, expressing their iron will to achieve a "good start" in their shift and to set an example for the entire plant to achieve "redness in every shift and redness every day."
    Li Shaokui, chief furnace master of No. 7 open-hearth furnace, and Chen Xiaofa, deputy director of the open-hearth furnace workshop, were originally on the day shift, but in order to start the year with a bang, they rushed to the furnace to compete in rapid steelmaking after a busy and tiring day.
    Chen Xiaofa's No. 2 open-hearth furnace, in order to produce two heats of steel on the first day of the New Year, used advanced methods of rapid furnace operation, shortening the furnace time by half. Then, in front of the open-hearth furnace spitting blue flames, his tall figure flashed from time to time, skillfully directing the workers' operations, resulting in a great acceleration of charging, repairing the furnace, and smelting time. When this news reached No. 7 open-hearth furnace, Li Shaokui also showed no weakness. With the close cooperation of other workers, he braved the scorching flames and high temperatures, observing the situation inside the furnace and adjusting the gas, and using the experience of using two pipes simultaneously to blow compressed air to accelerate melting. As a result, the operation time was also greatly advanced. The two of them chased each other, so busy that they didn't even have time to wipe their sweat.
    As a result of the night battle, both furnaces were ahead of schedule by more than an hour, starting the New Year with a bang.
    The Party Secretary Fights Alongside the Workers
    In the towering workshop of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant, the molten steel and lights reflected each other, and the night battle was in full swing. Today, like dozens of other factories and mines in Anshan Iron and Steel, the leading cadres were on the scene fighting alongside the workers, greeting the New Year with outstanding achievements.
    In front of No. 14 open-hearth furnace, Party Secretary Jin Duo, wearing a coarse canvas work uniform, was observing the smelting situation inside the furnace through blue glasses. In order to accelerate the melting speed, he immediately asked the workers to increase the compressed air. Then, Secretary Jin and the workers picked up shovels together and, braving the high-temperature atmosphere, repaired the furnace with sweat pouring down their faces. A tense scene immediately appeared in front of the furnace. With the specific help of Secretary Jin, the workers of No. 14 open-hearth furnace achieved rapid steelmaking, shortening the melting time by one hour compared to the plan, marking the beginning of the New Year.
    Using Innovation Achievements to Create High Output
    The night battle was even more intense in the No. 1 Primary Rolling Mill. Night shift rolling worker Qiao Rongxian was operating intensely. Today, Qiao Rongxian used the double-ingot rolling method created by the workers of this factory not long ago, rolling two large ingots at a time, increasing efficiency by about 8%. The acceleration of the rolling speed required the supply of more hot steel ingots. The famous steel heating expert Ning Changzeng also used his experience in rapid steel heating, adopting the method of frequently checking the fire and frequently adjusting the gas, greatly increasing the steel heating speed, so that hot steel ingots were sent to the rolling mill one after another, ensuring that this shift overfulfilled the rolling plan.
    Starting from zero o'clock this year, workers in many factories and mines in Anshan Iron and Steel have used the advanced experiences created in the Great Leap Forward in the past in production, and have achieved good results.
    Moving from Victory to Greater Victory
    In the steelmaking plant, the towering blast furnaces reaching into the clouds appeared even more majestic and magnificent in the night light.
    The employees of the famous No. 9 blast furnace were determined to win a victory that night. But the beginning was not very smooth, and the furnace lid was not working well, affecting production for more than an hour. The workers of the entire furnace did not lose heart, and they were determined to win back the lost time. A tense battle began. They cooperated with the raw material workers and immediately changed the charging method; they adopted rapid slag discharge measures. Braving the high temperature, they skillfully and vigorously struck the taphole with steel chisels and iron hammers, accelerating the speed of tapping iron. As a result, this shift produced more than 850 tons of pig iron, increasing production by more than 100 tons compared to the plan, fulfilling the vow to seize a "good start."
    The heroic employees of the No. 9 blast furnace achieved remarkable results in 1959, with an average utilization coefficient of 2.078 throughout the year, and as high as 2.374 in December, becoming the banner of all large blast furnaces. Before the New Year, the workers of the entire furnace discussed and decided to do a good job in preparation, create a high output level, and lay the foundation for a good start in 1960. Now, their determination to achieve high output has had a good start.
    It was already past 7:00 in the morning when we left the Anshan Iron and Steel factory area. The rising sun shone with golden light, adorning the Anshan Iron and Steel factory area even more beautifully and solemnly. The workers on the day shift rushed to the factory area from all directions, taking over from the night shift workers to continue the battle to seize victory.

    第一个黎明
    本报记者　白林材　孙铭惠
    夜半，当报告新年降临的钟声敲响了的时候，鞍钢的钢铁战士们，又精神奋发地投入了新的一年的战斗。
    今天鞍钢的夜，洋溢着更加炽烈的战斗气氛。离上班还有一个多小时，工人们就像潮水一般涌到了生产现场。一炉一炉的钢水铁水，把天空染得通红，弥漫在空中的浓黑色的、米黄色的、乳白色的烟雾分外美丽。“炼出了新年的第一炉快速炼钢”、“提前炼出了第一炉钢水”、“创造了快速轧钢的新纪录”——一个接着一个的捷报伴随着震天的锣鼓和鞭炮声，从各个厂房里传出来，使钢都之夜充满着一片胜利和欢乐的景象。
    两英雄炉前大比赛
    从午夜零时起，鞍钢各厂矿1960年第一个联合技术表演竞赛周开始了。第一炼钢厂夜班工人在投入竞赛前举行了誓师大会，下了钢铁般的决心，一定要在本班内实现开门红，为全厂班班红、日日红作出榜样。
    七号平炉总炉长李绍奎和平炉车间副主任陈效法，他们本来是白班，可是为了打响今年的第一炮，在忙累了一天之后，又一同跑到炉上比赛快速炼钢了。
    陈效法所在的二号平炉，为了争取在新年的第一天能炼出二炉钢，他运用了快速炼炉的先进方法，使炼炉时间缩短了一半。接着，在喷着蓝色火舌的平炉前，他的高大的身影不时的闪动，熟练地指挥着工人的操作，结果装料、补炉、熔炼时间都大大加快。这消息一传到七号平炉，李绍奎也不示弱，他在其他工人的密切配合下，冒着烤人的火焰高温，一会儿观察炉内情况，一会儿调整煤气，并且运用同时用两根管子吹压缩空气加快熔化的经验，结果操作时间也大大提前。你追我赶两个人忙得连汗水都顾不得擦。
    夜战的结果，两个炉子都比计划提前了一个多小时，打响了新年的第一炮。
    书记和工人在一起奋战
    巍峨的第二炼钢厂的厂房里钢水和灯火互相辉映，夜战正在紧张进行着。今天，这个厂和鞍钢其他几十个厂矿一样，领导干部们都在现场里同工人一起用出色的战斗迎接了新的一年。
    在14号平炉前，穿着粗帆布工作服的党委书记金铎，正在透过蓝眼镜观察炉内熔炼情况，为了加快熔炼速度，他立刻叫工人增加压缩空气。接着，金书记同工人一起又拿起锹，冒着高温的气氛，满头大汗的补起炉来。炉前立时呈现一片紧张的景象。14号平炉的工人们在金书记具体帮助下，实现了快速炼钢，熔化时间比计划缩短了一个小时，打响了新年第一炮。
    运用革新成果创高产
    在第一初轧厂里，夜战更热烈。夜班轧钢工人乔荣先正在紧张地操作，今天，乔荣先运用了不久前本厂工人创造的双锭轧钢法，一次轧两个大锭，使效率提高了8％左右。轧制速度的加快，需要供应更多的热钢锭，著名的烧钢能手宁长增也运用起他的快速烧钢的经验，采取了勤看火勤调整煤气的办法，大大提高了烧钢速度，使热钢锭一块接着一块送到了轧钢机前，保证这个班超额完成了轧制计划。
    从今年零时开始，鞍钢许多厂矿工人在生产上运用了过去大跃进中创造的先进经验，都取得了良好的效果。
    从胜利走向更大的胜利
    炼铁厂里一座座高耸云空的大高炉，在夜间的火光里，显得更加雄伟壮丽。
    著名的九号高炉的职工这天夜间决心要打个胜仗。可是开始并不太顺利，炉子大盖不太好使，影响了一个多小时的生产。全炉工人没有泄气，他们决心要把损失的时间夺回来。一场紧张的战斗开始了，他们同原料工人协作，马上改变了装料方法；采取了快速放渣的措施，他们冒着高温用钢钎和铁锤巧妙的猛打出铁口，加快了打出铁口的速度，结果这一个班生产了八百五十多吨生铁，比计划增产一百多吨。实现了夺取开门红的誓言。
    英雄的九号高炉的职工在1959年获得了显著的成绩，全年平均利用系数达到二点零七八，其中12月份更高达二点三七四，成了全大型高炉的旗帜。新年前，全炉工人经过讨论，决心作好准备工作，创造高产水平，为1960年开门红打下基础。现在，他们实现高产的决心已经有了一个良好的开端。
    我们离开鞍钢厂区已是早上七点多钟了。升起了的太阳洒下了一片金光，把鞍钢的厂区点缀得更加美丽庄严。上白班的工人们从四面八方奔向厂区，接替夜班工人去继续夺取胜利的战斗。
