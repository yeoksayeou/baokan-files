Xinhua News Agency, January 29th, TASS Moscow, January 28th: On January 27th of this year, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko invited Japanese Ambassador to Moscow, Kadowaki Suemitsu, to the Soviet Foreign Ministry and, entrusted by the Soviet government, handed Kadowaki Suemitsu a memorandum. The full text of the memorandum is as follows:

    On January 19th of this year, Japan and the United States signed the so-called "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security." The content of this treaty seriously endangers the situation in the Far East and the Pacific region, thereby endangering the interests of many countries located in this vast region, and of course, primarily endangering the interests of Japan's neighbors, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

    According to this treaty, the stationing of foreign armed forces and the establishment of military bases on Japanese territory are once again affirmed for a long period with the voluntary consent of the Japanese government. According to Article VI of the aforementioned treaty, the United States' "Army, Air Force, and Navy are permitted to use facilities and areas in Japan." The ancillary condition in the treaty regarding consultations on the implementation of the treaty cannot conceal the fact that Japan may be dragged into military conflicts against the will of the Japanese people.

    The treaty perpetuates the de facto occupation of Japan, places Japanese territory at the disposal of foreign countries, separates Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands from Japan, and inevitably leads to Japan's military, economic, and political dependence on others under the terms of the treaty. All of this raises a legitimate question: After the treaty takes effect, what will actually remain of Japan's sovereignty? The mere fact that foreign troops will continue to be stationed in Japan in the future means that Japan's actions are restricted. The essence of the matter is this: Japan has signed a new military treaty, thereby handing over a large part of the powers of a sovereign state to foreign countries and losing its national independence.

    Directly related to this is the treaty's stipulation that Japan must increase its own military potential. Everyone knows that the mission of this treaty is to accelerate the rearmament of Japan, and in the plan for the rearmament of Japan, equipping the Japanese armed forces and foreign troops stationed on Japanese territory with rocket-nuclear weapons occupies a special place. In this way, Japan has violated the peaceful guarantees repeatedly talked about by the Japanese government, violated the Japanese constitution which declares that Japan will never wage war or threaten with military force, and openly embarked on the path of broad re-militarization.

    The Japanese government seems to believe that the "permanence" mentioned in the constitution adopted thirteen years ago has expired. If the fundamental law of the state of Japan solemnly condemned war in 1947, then in 1960, Japanese foreign policy is increasingly and obviously trending towards militarization and direct participation in military treaties aimed at opposing maintaining peace in the Far East.

    The Soviet government has repeatedly drawn the attention of the Japanese government to the dangers inherent in any step in international politics that would exacerbate the threat of a new war breaking out. It seems that it is particularly well-founded to issue such a warning now. Japan's conclusion of a new military treaty will in no way guarantee Japan's security. On the contrary, this practice deepens the danger that Japan's involvement in a new war will inevitably lead to catastrophe. Now, who does not know that in the case of modern rocket-nuclear war, the entire Japan, which is not large in area, densely populated, and dotted with foreign military bases, will suffer the tragic fate of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the first few minutes?

    Now, the true greatness of a country, its international influence, and the wisdom of its national leaders are not measured by how many new divisions its army has added, nor by how many new foreign bases will be added to its territory in addition to the existing foreign bases. Today, a country's prestige and its role in international affairs depend primarily on: how much contribution it has made to the cause of consolidating peace, and to what extent its leaders are resolutely committed to easing international tensions, to disarmament, to destroying the entire war machine, and to eliminating the scourge of foreign military bases, a relic of the "Cold War," in any country.

    Can it be considered that the Japanese government's signing of this treaty (which opens the door wider to foreign occupation and to turning Japanese territory into a military base) is in line with these goals? Just asking such a question makes the answer self-evident.

    It is well known how widely the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament put forward by the head of the Soviet government, Khrushchev, at the United Nations has resonated throughout the world. The people of all countries justly see the realization of this proposal as a way to free mankind from the burdens of war and armaments. The Japanese government knows that the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution agreeing to the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament. The Japanese delegation also voted in favor of this resolution. The Disarmament Committee, specially composed of ten countries, will begin studying this proposal in the near future. However, the Japanese government not only did not wait for the committee to complete its work, but did not even wait for the committee to start working, and concluded a new military treaty, the purpose of which is directly contrary to the purpose of disarmament.

    The Soviet government is always ready to fully support Japan in taking steps to ensure conditions for its peaceful and independent development. The Soviet Union, as in the past, remains ready, along with other countries, to provide the necessary guarantees for Japan's neutrality. Everyone knows that the Soviet government advocates the signing of a peace and friendship treaty between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and Japan, and agrees to allow the United States and other Pacific countries to participate as well. The Soviet government has repeatedly emphasized that the Soviet Union strives to establish genuine good-neighborly relations with Japan, expand mutually beneficial trade and cultural ties, and promote the rapprochement between Japan and the Soviet Union, which is beneficial to the Japanese and Soviet peoples.

    However, the Soviet Union cannot, of course, ignore the step taken by Japan in signing a military treaty, which undermines the foundation of peace in the Far East and creates obstacles to the development of Soviet-Japanese relations. Because this treaty effectively deprives Japan of its independence, and because foreign troops stationed in Japan as a result of Japan's surrender will continue to remain on Japanese territory, a new situation has been formed. Under these circumstances, the Soviet government cannot fulfill its promise to hand over the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island to Japan.

    The Soviet government had previously accommodated Japan's wishes, taking into account the national interests of the Japanese state and the peace-loving aspirations expressed by the Japanese government in the course of Soviet-Japanese negotiations, and agreed to hand over the aforementioned islands to Japan after the conclusion of a peace treaty. However, the Soviet government, taking into account that the purpose of the new military treaty signed by the Japanese government is to oppose the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, cannot contribute to a situation in which the territory used by foreign troops is further expanded due to the transfer of the aforementioned islands to Japan. Therefore, the Soviet government considers it necessary to declare that the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island can only be handed over to Japan in accordance with the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration of October 19, 1956, on the condition that all foreign troops withdraw from Japanese territory and a peace treaty is signed between the Soviet Union and Japan.

    From the above, it can be seen that the Japanese government must bear serious responsibility for all the consequences arising from the signing of a military treaty that violates the interests of guaranteeing peace in the Far East.

### 苏联政府向日本提出备忘录  日美新军事条约危害苏中和远东各国

    苏联政府向日本提出备忘录
    日美新军事条约危害苏中和远东各国
    日本让外国驻扎军队和设置军事基地丧失民族独立
    在这种情况下苏联不能把齿舞群岛色丹岛移交日本
    新华社29日讯　塔斯社莫斯科28日电：今年1月27日，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯请日本驻莫斯科大使门胁季光到苏联外交部，并受苏联政府的委托，交给门胁季光一份备忘录。备忘录全文如下：
    今年1月19日，日本和美国签订了所谓“共同合作和安全条约”。这个条约的内容严重地危及远东和太平洋地区的局势，从而危及位于这一广大地区的许多国家的利益，当然，首先是危及日本的近邻苏联和中华人民共和国的利益。
    根据这个条约，在日本领土上驻扎外国武装部队和设置军事基地一事，又一次在日本政府自愿同意下长期肯定下来了。根据上述条约第六条的规定，美国的“陆军、空军和海军被允许使用在日本的设施和地区”。条约中关于就条约的执行问题进行协商的附带条件并不能掩盖下面一个事实，即日本可能在不顾日本人民的意志的情况下卷入军事冲突。
    通过条约使对日本的实际占领永久化，把日本的领土供给外国支配，使冲绳岛和小笠原群岛脱离日本，根据条约的条款所必然带来的使日本在军事、经济和政治上依赖他人——这一切就产生一个合理的问题：条约生效以后，日本主权实际上还能剩下什么呢？单单是外国军队今后仍将驻扎在日本这一事实就意味着日本的行动受到限制。问题实质上是这样的：日本签订了新的军事条约，这样就亲手把一个主权国家的很大一部分权力交给外国，丧失了本国的民族独立。
    与此有直接关系的是条约中规定的日本要提高本国军事潜力的义务。谁都知道，这个条约的使命就是加速重新武装日本，而在重新武装日本的计划中，以火箭—核武器装备日本武装部队和驻扎在日本领土上的外国军队，占有特别的地位。这样一来，日本就违背了日本政府多次谈论的爱好和平的保证，违背了宣布日本永远不进行战争和不以军事力量相威胁的日本宪法，公然走上广泛重新军国主义化的道路。
    日本政府看来认为，十三年前所通过的宪法中所提到的“永久”已经届满了。如果说，1947年日本的国家根本法严正地谴责过战争的话，那么，1960年日本外交政策却越来越明显地倾向于军国主义化和直接参加以反对维持远东和平为目的的军事条约。
    苏联政府不止一次地提请日本政府注意：现在，国际政治中任何会加剧爆发新战争威胁的步骤，包藏着怎样的危险。看来，现在提出这样的警告，是尤其有充分根据的。日本缔结新军事条约，绝不会保障日本的安全。相反，这种做法加深这样的危险：日本卷入新战争的结果必然招致浩劫。现在，谁不知道：在现代火箭—核战争的情况下，幅员不大、人口稠密、外国军事基地星罗棋布的整个日本，在最初几分钟就会遭到广岛和长崎的悲惨命运。
    现在，一个国家的真正伟大、它的国际影响以及它的国家领导人的英明，不是用它的军队补充了多少个新师来衡量，也不是用在它的领土上除了现有的外国基地之外还将增添多少新的外国基地来衡量。今天，一个国家的威信、它在国际事务中的作用首先取决于：它对巩固和平的事业作了多大的贡献，它的领导人在多大的程度上坚决致力于缓和国际紧张局势，致力于裁军，致力于销毁整个战争机器，致力于使任何一个国家都消除外国军事基地这种“冷战”的遗毒。
    能否认为日本政府签订这一条约（它为外国占领、为把日本领土变成军事基地更广阔地敞开了国家的大门），是符合这些目的呢？只消提出这样的问题，答案就不言自明了。
    大家很清楚，苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫在联合国提出的全面和彻底裁军的建议在全世界得到了多么广泛的反响。各国人民公正地把实现这个建议看作是使人类摆脱战争和军备负担的途径。日本政府知道，联合国大会一致通过了一项决议，同意全面彻底裁军的主张。日本代表团也投票赞成这项决议。由十个国家专门组成的裁军委员会将在最近的将来着手研究这个建议。然而，日本政府不但没有等到委员会工作结束，甚至没有等到委员会开始工作，就缔结了新的军事条约，而这个条约所追求的目的是直接违背裁军的宗旨的。
    苏联政府随时准备完全支持日本为保证本国和平和独立发展的条件而采取的步骤。苏联同过去一样，仍然准备同其他国家一道，为日本的中立提供必要的保证。大家知道，苏联政府主张在苏联、中华人民共和国和日本之间签订和平友好条约，并同意让美国和其他太平洋国家也参加，苏联政府不止一次地强调指出，苏联力求同日本建立真正的睦邻关系，扩大互利的贸易和文化等联系，以促进日本和苏联之间的接近，以有利于日本和苏联人民。
    但是，苏联当然不能无视日本签订军事条约这样的步骤，这个条约破坏远东和平的基础，为苏日关系的发展制造了障碍。由于这个条约实际上剥夺了日本的独立，由于因日本的投降而驻扎在日本的外国军队将继续留驻日本领土，因而形成了新的情况，在这种情况下，苏联政府就不可能履行关于把齿舞群岛和色丹岛移交给日本的诺言。
    苏联政府曾经迁就了日本的愿望，考虑到日本国家的民族利益和当时日本政府在苏日谈判过程中所表示的爱好和平的愿望，同意在缔结和约后将上述岛屿移交给日本。但是，苏联政府考虑到日本政府所签订的新的军事条约的目的是反对苏联和中华人民共和国的，因此，苏联政府不能助长这样的情况：由于把上述岛屿移交给日本而更加扩大外国军队所利用的领土。因此，苏联政府认为必须声明，只有在一切外国军队撤出日本领土并签订苏联和日本之间的和约的条件下，才能根据苏日1956年10月19日联合宣言把齿舞群岛和色丹岛移交给日本。
    从上述情况可以看出，日本政府应对由于签订违反保证远东和平的利益的军事条约而产生的一切后果负严重责任。
