Editorial: New Developments in Rural Tool Reform

    Currently, the rural tool reform movement across the country has seen significant development. According to statistics from the agricultural departments as of December 15th last year, over 225 million tools have been created, improved, and promoted nationwide. In particular, tool reform has universally formed a high tide during this water conservancy movement. Various regions have widely promoted advanced tools that have proven effective. For example, in the past month or two, over 2,000 people from more than 20 provinces have visited and studied the semi-mechanization movement at the Ziyunshan Reservoir construction site in Fengcheng County, Jiangxi Province. Due to the extensive promotion of advanced tools, the average work efficiency at water conservancy construction sites across the country has rapidly increased, now averaging four cubic meters of earthwork per person per day. More gratifying is that, while widely promoting advanced tools, tool reform movements in some advanced areas have developed from reforming tools for partial processes to comprehensively reforming tools for all processes within a production project. The complete soil mechanization of the entire process of the Ganxu Province's water diversion project, the complete simple mechanization of grain processing in Zhangjiawan Commune, Tongzhou District, Beijing, the semi-mechanization of all feeding labor in many pig farms, and the semi-mechanization of most labor in many canteens, are all good examples. The news published in today's newspaper about Xichong County, Sichuan Province, comprehensively reforming all tools for ten projects including agricultural production, water conservancy construction, and diversified operations, is worthy of attention throughout the country. Xichong County has developed from reforming all tools for all processes within one production project to reforming all tools for all major production projects in rural production labor, resulting in a more comprehensive and significant increase in labor efficiency.
    The tool reform movement generally starts with processes that are the most labor-intensive, seasonally demanding, and easiest to reform with the greatest benefits. This approach is correct and necessary. After these key breakthroughs, it can move towards comprehensive development. Generally speaking, when a process implements tool reform, work efficiency can be immediately multiplied. However, the various processes of agricultural production are closely linked. Therefore, the reform of tools in one area will inevitably promote the reform of tools in connected processes. In this way, the overall production efficiency can be multiplied. Taking water conservancy construction as an example, if only the tools for digging soil are reformed, without paying attention to reforming the tools for loading and transporting soil, not only will the overall efficiency of the construction site not be improved, but the improvement in digging soil efficiency will also be limited. If more soil is dug out, but it cannot be loaded and transported, the speed of digging will inevitably be reduced. Therefore, in areas where a high tide of tool reform has already formed, comprehensively reforming tools has become a particularly important issue that needs attention. Of course, comprehensive tool reform cannot be perfected from the beginning. It requires various regions to gradually promote and improve it in practice based on local conditions, so that it can be gradually perfected. Currently, all places that have begun comprehensive tool reform have formulated plans based on local conditions, identified key points, and started with projects that require the greatest amount of labor, are most seasonally demanding, have the most significant increase in production, and are easy to reform with quick results, and have a considerable original foundation. To prepare for comprehensive reform, the already reformed tools should also be evaluated and categorized, so that all processes of each production project can use improved tools and semi-mechanized tools, forming a closely connected, mutually promoting, and jointly improving system of improved and semi-mechanized tools. This not only helps to fully utilize the effectiveness of existing improved and semi-mechanized tools, but also helps to promote the technical transformation of agriculture, paving a reliable path for the gradual realization of mechanization.
    The requirement to comprehensively reform the tools for agricultural production and water conservancy construction reflects not only the ambition of the Chinese people to accelerate the transformation of the "poor and blank" state of the countryside, but also the practical action to strive for continued leaps forward in agricultural production this year. The development of the rural tool reform movement over the past few years has prepared excellent conditions for comprehensive tool reform. A large number of new tools that have been promoted nationwide almost cover all major aspects of agricultural production. Taking Xichong County as an example, the tools created, imitated, and improved by this county can already meet about half of the needs of various production projects. In addition, the tool reform movement over the past few years has also provided rich experience in reforming tools, prepared material foundations such as equipment, and cultivated a large number of local experts, iron and woodworking workers, and other technical talents. What is particularly important is that the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses for agricultural technical transformation are increasing day by day; in places where a high tide of tool reform has formed, comprehensively and systematically reforming tools has become a new topic for the mass movement. The decisive factor for comprehensively carrying out tool reform is that the people's communes have unparalleled superiority in accelerating agricultural technical transformation. They have strong manpower and material resources, and increasingly developing community-run industries, mainly community-run industries. People's communes in many places can not only manufacture general new-style farm tools, but also manufacture semi-mechanized farm tools with more complex structures. These are all favorable conditions for the new development of rural tool reform. Therefore, we must continue to adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out mass movements, grasp promotion with one hand and reform with the other, vigorously promote in areas where promotion work has not been done well, and strive to promote comprehensive reform in areas where promotion work has been done well, setting off a new high tide of technical innovation in promoting new tools and reforming old tools.
    The experience of the past few years proves that whether it is inventing new farm tools or promoting advanced tools, the first fundamental issue involved is that the treatment of tool reform must adhere to the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and the spirit of continuous revolution. The comrades in Xichong County and many other advanced places across the country are doing just that. They treat the creativity of the masses with full enthusiasm, on the one hand, doing everything possible to consolidate the achievements made in the tool reform movement, and on the other hand, not being satisfied with certain achievements in their work. They are both down-to-earth and far-sighted; they start with the current tool reform and look forward to the comprehensive realization of agricultural technical transformation in the future. They go deep into the masses, grasp the laws of the movement; at each stage of the movement's development, they promptly seize the main links that promote the movement's development, jointly study with the masses, find ways to solve the current main contradictions, and make the movement develop to a higher level step by step. In contrast, some people sit and wait for mechanization and are not interested in reforming existing tools and creating semi-mechanized tools. In this way, it is of course impossible to foresee the development trend of the movement and impossible to guide the movement forward. There are also some people who are only satisfied with the tool reform of individual processes and individual projects, are not proactive or active, or only look at the number of promotions and not the overall promotion effect. In this way, it will inevitably be difficult to promote the tool reform movement in a faster, better, and more economical way. The above two types of people have not seriously considered the current real conditions in our country, have not fully estimated the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses in reforming tools and improving labor efficiency, and have not understood the inevitable process of gradually realizing agricultural technical transformation starting with tool reform. Therefore, in the tool reform movement, we must advocate the spirit of bold innovation, vigorous promotion, and continuous revolution, and oppose all conservative and backward ideas that are divorced from the masses.
    The new high tide of rural leaps forward will have greater development with the arrival of spring production. The tool reform movement is the vanguard of the new high tide. The news of the comprehensive reform of tools in Xichong County and other places brings the good news of the great development of rural tool reform this year. It is hoped that all localities will muster their energy, vigorously promote and reform tools, and promote the transformation of agricultural technology and the great leap forward in agricultural production.

### 农村工具改革的新发展

    农村工具改革的新发展
    目前，全国农村工具改革运动有了很大的发展，据农业部门截至去年12月15日的统计，全国创造、改良和推广的工具，已达二亿二千五百多万件；特别是在这次水利运动中，工具改革已经普遍形成了高潮。各地大量推广已经行之有效的先进工具，例如一两个月来已有二十多个省、二千多人参观学习了江西丰城县紫云山水库工地的半机械化运动。由于广泛地推广了先进工具，全国水利工地的平均工效迅速提高，现在每人每天可做四立方米土方。更值得可喜的，是在大量推广先进工具的同时，好些先进地区的工具改革运动已经从改革部分工序上的工具，发展到成套地改革一个生产项目全部工序上的工具。甘肃省引洮工程全部工序实现土机械化，北京市通州区张家湾公社粮食加工全部实现简易机械化，以及不少养猪场实现全部饲养劳动半机械化，不少食堂的大部分劳动也实现了半机械化，等等，都是很好的证明。今天本报发表的四川省西充县成套地改革农业生产、水利建设、多种经营等十个项目全部工具的消息，值得各地注意。西充县已经从改革一个生产项目全部工序的工具发展到改革农村生产劳动各个主要生产项目全部工序的工具，使劳动效率得到更全面、更显著地提高。
    工具改革运动，一般是从费工最多、季节性较强，和改革较易、收效较大的工序开始。这样做是正确的、必要的。这些重点突破之后，就可以向全面发展。一般说，一个工序实行了工具改革，工效立即可以成倍地提高；但是农业生产的各个工序是紧密相连的，因此，一处工具的改革必然会促进相连的各个工序的工具改革。这样，整个生产的工效就可以成倍地提高。以水利建设来说，如果只注意改革挖土的工具，而不注意改革装土、运土的工具，不但整个工地的工效不能提高，就是挖土工效的提高也是有限度的，挖出来的土多了，装运不出去，挖土的速度也就必然会减弱。因此，在已经形成工具改革高潮的地区，成套地改革工具就成为目前特别需要注意的一个问题。当然，成套地改革工具，不可能一开始就非常完善，需要各地在实践中因地制宜地逐步推广、逐步改进，使其逐步完善起来。现在，凡是开始全面改革工具的地方，都是根据当地条件制定了计划，确定了重点，首先从需工量最大、季节性最强、增产最显著，以及改革起来费工不大、收效最快，而且原来具有相当基础的项目开始。为了给全面改革作好准备，还应该对已经改革的工具进行鉴定，排队，使各个生产项目的全部工序都用上改良工具和半机械化工具，构成一个个紧密相接、互相促进、共同提高的改良工具和半机械化工具的体系。这样做，不但有利于充分发挥现有改良工具和半机械化工具的效能，并且有利于促进农业技术改造，为逐步实现机械化开辟一条可靠的途径。
    要求成套地改革农业生产和水利建设的工具，这不仅反映了我国人民加速改变农村“一穷二白”面貌的雄心壮志，而且也是争取今年农业生产继续跃进的实际行动。几年来农村工具改革运动的发展，已经为成套改革工具准备了很好的条件。全国已经推广的大量的新式工具，几乎包括了农业生产的各个主要方面。就以西充县来说，这个县创造、仿制和改良的工具，已经可以满足各个生产项目一半左右的需要。此外，几年来的工具改革运动还提供了改革工具的丰富经验，准备了器材、设备等物质基础，培养了大量的土专家、铁木工人等技术人才。尤其重要的是，广大群众对于农业技术改造的积极性和创造性日益高涨；在工具改革运动形成高潮的地方，全面地系统地改革工具已经成为群众运动的新的课题。全面进行工具改革的决定性的因素是：人民公社在加速农业技术改造中有无比的优越性。它具有强大的人力和物力，有以社办工业为主的日益发展的社办事业。许多地方的人民公社不仅可以制造一般的新式农具，而且可以制造结构比较复杂的半机械化农具。这些，都是农村工具改革新发展的有利条件。因此，我们必须继续坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，一手抓推广，一手抓改革，在推广工作做得不够好的地区大力推广，在推广工作做得好的地区努力促进成套地全面改革，掀起推广新工具、改革旧工具的技术革新的新高潮。
    几年来的经验证明，发明创造新农具也好，推广先进工具也好，首先牵涉到的一个根本问题，就是对待工具改革必须坚持共产主义的敢想敢说敢做的风格和不断革命的精神。西充县和全国其他许多先进地方的同志们正是这样做的。他们满腔热情地对待群众的创造，一方面千方百计地巩固工具改革运动中取得的成果，另一方面又不以工作中的某些成就为满足。既脚踏实地，又高瞻远瞩；既从当前的工具改革着手，又从将来全面实现农业技术改造着眼。他们深入群众，掌握运动的规律；在运动发展的各个阶段，及时抓住促进运动发展的主要环节，与群众共同研究，找出解决当前主要矛盾的办法，使运动一步步发展到更高的水平。与此相反，有一些人坐等机械化，对改革现有工具，创造半机械化工具不感兴趣。这样，当然不可能预见运动的发展趋势，不可能引导运动前进。还有一些人，只是满足于个别工序个别项目的工具改革，不主动，不积极，或者只看推广件数，不看总的推广成效。这样，也必然难以多快好省地推进工具改革运动。以上两种人，都没有认真考虑目前我国的现实条件，没有充分估计广大群众改革工具、提高劳动效率的积极性和创造性，没有理解从工具改革入手逐步实现农业技术改造的必然进程。因此，我们在工具改革运动中，必须提倡大胆革新，大力推广，不断革命的精神，反对一切保守落后的脱离群众的思想。
    农村新的跃进高潮，随着春季生产的到来将有更大的发展。工具改革运动是新高潮的先行官。西充县等地的全面改革工具的消息带来了今年农村工具改革大发展的喜讯。希望各地鼓足干劲，大力推广和改革工具，促进农业技术的改造和农业生产的大跃进。
