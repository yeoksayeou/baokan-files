Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Tokyo News: The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry announced on the 12th that it would implement "liberalization" of trade and foreign exchange for the import of 434 items. This measure will be implemented in stages from April 1 this year.

This measure was passed at a "Cabinet Meeting on Promoting Trade and Exchange Liberalization" chaired by Nobusuke Kishi. Relevant cabinet members attended the meeting.

The United States has been putting pressure on Japan to lift restrictions on American imports and investments.

The Japanese government announced this before Nobusuke Kishi left for the United States to sign the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in an attempt to win American support for Japan's economic expansion in Southeast Asia. This issue will be discussed by Nobusuke Kishi and U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

According to the announcement by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, 291 of the 434 items will be transferred to the category of import "automatic approval system." These goods include nickel ore, coffee beans, plastics, dyes, organic and inorganic chemicals, tea and textiles. Under this system, importers can import these goods without government approval and can obtain automatic bank approval for these commodities.

The other 143 commodities, including chemicals, pottery, canned foods and groceries, will be transferred to the "automatic foreign currency allocation system." This system is an intermediate system between the "foreign currency allocation system" and the "automatic approval system," stipulating that foreign exchange within a certain limit can be automatically allocated.

In addition, Japan has decided to remove the special restrictions currently placed on six commodities imported from the dollar area. Among these commodities, scrap iron, butter and lard will be de-restricted from April 1. These goods from the dollar area are now handled under the "foreign exchange allocation system," while the same goods from non-dollar areas are handled under the "automatic approval system."

Within the first half of this year, Japan will lift restrictions on leather from the dollar area, and from October, lift restrictions on pig iron and soybeans.

The 434 commodities that have been "liberalized" involve an annual import value of 50 million U.S. dollars. Last November, Japan relaxed import restrictions on 181 commodities. After the restrictions on the goods announced this time are lifted, 70% of imported goods will be imported into Japan without restrictions.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: The Japanese "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper today published an editorial commenting on the Nobusuke Kishi government's decision on the 12th to accelerate the relaxation of trade and foreign exchange restrictions, saying that this is a gift that Nobusuke Kishi wants to take to Washington to offer to the United States.

The newspaper said that the practice of relaxing trade and foreign exchange restrictions was imposed on Japan by the United States, and its purpose is to facilitate American free investment in Japan, use Japan's cheap labor to carry out economic expansion in Southeast Asia, and enable Americans to freely remit profits earned in Japan back to the United States at any time.

The editorial continued, "Therefore, this is a gift to American monopoly capitalists, allowing them to exploit the working class and seize profits in Japan. Moreover, the Japanese government and monopoly capital groups are trying to exchange this for American help in realizing its long-standing desire to carry out economic expansion in Southeast Asia."

"Asahi Shimbun," "Yomiuri Shimbun," and "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" also believe that the government's decision to relax trade and foreign exchange is a gift from Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi to the United States. "Asahi Shimbun" said, "We get the impression that the government was forced to take this major measure under the pressure exerted on it by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade meeting held in Tokyo last autumn and the recent strong demands from the United States."

### 岸信介政府不顾日本民族利益引狼入室  放宽对美国商品和投资的限制

    岸信介政府不顾日本民族利益引狼入室
    放宽对美国商品和投资的限制
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本通商产业省在12日宣布对四百三十四项货物的进口实行贸易和外汇的“自由化”。这项措施将从今年4月1日起分阶段进行。
    这项措施是在一个由岸信介主持的叫做“促进贸易汇兑自由化阁员会议”通过的，参加这个会议的有各有关阁员。
    美国一直在对日本施加压力，要它取消对美国进口货和投资的限制。
    日本政府在岸信介动身前往美国去签订新的日美“安全条约”之前宣布这件事，是企图争取美国支持日本在东南亚的经济扩张。这一问题将由岸信介和美国总统艾森豪威尔商谈。
    据通商产业省的这个公告说，在这四百三十四项货物中，二百九十一项货物将转入进口“自动批准制”这一类别中。这些货物包括镍矿石、咖啡豆、塑料、染料、有机和无机化学品、茶叶和纺织品。根据这个制度，进口商不必经政府批准即可输入这些货物，可以得到银行对这些商品的自动批准。
    其他包括化学品、陶器、罐头食品和杂货等一百四十三项商品将转入“外汇自动拨付制”这一类别中。这个制度是介于“外汇拨付制”和“自动批准制”之间的一种中间性制度，规定某种限额之内的外汇可以自动拨付。
    此外，日本已经决定取消现在对从美元区进口的六项商品的特别限制。在这些商品中，废铁、牛油和猪油将自4月1日起取消限制。这些来自美元区的商品现在按“外汇拨付制”处理，而来自非美元区的同样商品按“自动批准制”处理。
    在今年上半年内，日本将取消对美元地区的皮革的限制，自10月起，取消对生铁和大豆的限制。
    这四百三十四项得到“自由化”的商品牵涉到每年五千万美元的进口额。去年11月，日本曾经放宽了对一百八十一项商品的进口限制。在对这次宣布的货物取消限制之后，就将有70％的进口商品不受限制地输入日本。
    据新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本“赤旗报”今天发表社论评论岸信介政府12日关于加速放宽贸易和外汇限制的决定时说，这是岸信介要带到华盛顿去献给美国的礼物。
    这家报纸说，放宽贸易和外汇限制的做法，是美国强加于日本的，其目的在于便利美国在日本自由投资，利用日本的廉价劳动力在东南亚进行经济扩张，使美国人能够在任何时候随意把在日本赚到的利润汇回美国。
    社论接着说，“因此，这是向美国垄断资本家赠礼，是听任他们在日本剥削工人阶级，攫取利润。而且，日本政府和垄断资本集团正在设法以此为代价，换取美国帮助它实现它长期以来企图在东南亚实行经济扩张的愿望。”
    “朝日新闻”、“读卖新闻”和“日本经济新闻”也认为，政府关于放宽贸易和外汇的决定是岸信介首相献给美国的礼物。“朝日新闻”说，“我们得到的印象是，政府是在去年秋天在东京举行的关税及贸易总协定会议对它施加压力和在美国最近提出强烈要求的情况下，被迫采取这一事关重大的措施的”。
