Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th. Eight hundred and two overseas Chinese returned to Shenzhen on the 6th, warmly greeted by people from all walks of life in the motherland. Among these returning overseas Chinese, thirty-one were from Singapore and Malaya, while the rest were from Indonesia, including more than three hundred and fifty young students returning to China for further education.

　　At noon that day, the returning overseas Chinese, supporting the old and carrying the young, crossed the Shenzhen bridge and embraced the motherland. More than one hundred reception staff, doctors, and nurses waiting at the bridgehead rushed to help them carry luggage, hold children, and support the elderly. As soon as they settled down at the reception point, hot meals were delivered to each returning overseas Chinese. Some overseas Chinese who lacked clothing were given brand-new cotton-padded clothes by the people of the motherland, and patients received enthusiastic care. Zhou Tie, a sixty-seven-year-old man who had lived in Indonesia for forty years, only carried a tattered rattan basket. The warm reception and condolences from the motherland moved him to tears. He said, "I really didn't expect this, am I dreaming?" Huang Yaguang, an old welder who had worked in Bangka Island, Indonesia for more than twenty years, returned to the motherland with his family of eight, the oldest child being only seven years old. When he was worrying about his children's thin clothes, the reception staff sent cotton-padded clothes over. He excitedly said, "The motherland is so warm! We are no longer orphans abroad."

　　Border guards, customs officers, and people from all walks of life in Shenzhen extended their concern and care to the returning overseas Chinese. All the luggage and belongings brought by these returning overseas Chinese were exempted from customs duties by the Shenzhen Customs in accordance with national regulations.

　　In the evening, the people of all circles in Bao'an County held a welcome meeting for the returning overseas Chinese in the auditorium of the Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Service Agency. Representatives from the Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese delivered speeches at the meeting, extending a warm welcome and condolences to the returning overseas Chinese. Ji Fengting, the head of Bao'an County, said at the meeting that the people of the motherland are very concerned about the plight of the overseas Chinese in Indonesia and welcome them to return to the motherland to participate in the socialist construction. He wished the overseas Chinese to contribute their strength to the motherland after taking up their posts in construction. After the welcome meeting, the domestic color feature film "Celebrating Ten Years" was shown.

　　On this day, teacher and student representatives from overseas Chinese preparatory schools in Beijing, Guangzhou, Fujian, Shantou and other places warmly received the overseas Chinese students returning to China for further education.

    新华社广州7日电　6日，有八百零二名华侨，在祖国各界人民的热情接待下，回到了深圳。在这批归侨中，除三十一名来自新加坡、马来亚外，其他都来自印度尼西亚，有三百五十多名是回国升学的青年学生。
    这天中午，扶老携幼的归侨队伍，经过深圳桥头，投入祖国的怀抱。等候在桥头的一百多个接待人员和医生、护士，连忙为他们搬行李，抱孩子，扶老人。他们在接待地点刚刚安顿下来，热菜热饭就送到每个归侨的手上。一些缺少衣服的侨胞，穿上了祖国人民送给的崭新棉衣，病人受到了热情的照顾。一位在印度尼西亚侨居四十年的六十七岁老人周帖，手里只提着一个破藤篮，祖国的亲切接待和慰问，使他感动得落泪，他说：“真真想不到，我是在做梦吗？”在印度尼西亚汶岛工作二十多年的老焊工黄亚光，一家八口返回祖国，最大的孩子才七岁。当他正在为孩子们衣衫单薄发愁的时候，接待人员就把棉衣送过来了。他激动地说：“祖国多么温暖呀！我们不再是海外孤儿了。”
    深圳的边防军战士、海关人员和各界群众，都向归侨们问寒问暖。这批归侨所带的一切行李物品，深圳海关根据国家规定，全部免征关税。
