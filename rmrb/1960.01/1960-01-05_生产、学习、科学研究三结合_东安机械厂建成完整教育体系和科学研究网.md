According to Heilongjiang Daily news: Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, the Dong'an Machinery Factory has, over the past year, adhered to the principle of prioritizing production, vigorously developing workers' spare-time education, and engaging in mass scientific research. This has greatly improved the political, technical, and cultural levels of the workers, cultivated technical talent for the country, and promoted the development of production, initially forming a base where production labor, learning, and scientific research are "three combined."

The Dong'an Machinery Factory has been an advanced unit in Heilongjiang Province for several years in terms of workers' spare-time education. With the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958, the factory's Party Committee, while further strengthening workers' spare-time education, also particularly strengthened its leadership over mass scientific and technological research. Currently, the factory has formed a complete spare-time education system from primary school to university. Last year, the average enrollment rate of workers in the factory reached about 87% of the total number of employees, and the attendance rate reached 85%. The factory runs 40 classes of university, middle school, and secondary specialized education (including various types of classes such as spare-time, part-work part-study, and full-time); the workshops run 25 branch schools below junior high school level, totaling 144 classes. Political theory study throughout the factory is also unprecedentedly active, with 2,600 workers participating in philosophy studies alone. The scientific research network extends to all departments, workshops, and groups, with 39 scientific groups and more than 250 people regularly engaged in research activities.

The Dong'an Machinery Factory Party Committee adopted a method of unified leadership, unified organization, and unified arrangement, prioritizing production and closely combining production, spare-time education, and scientific research. Under the leadership of the Party, the factory established a Workers' Education Committee and a Scientific Research Committee. Each workshop has a Workers' Education Branch and a Scientific Research Branch, led by the deputy director of personnel and the deputy director of technology, respectively, thus ensuring the close integration of the three aspects organizationally. At the same time, the Party organizations of the factory and workshops made specific arrangements for spare-time education and scientific research work while discussing and deploying production tasks for each period, so that they could better serve production.

The specific methods of combining spare-time education and scientific research with production and serving production at this factory are to propose scientific research topics and carry out technical and cultural studies around the annual, quarterly, and monthly production plans of the factory and workshops. In terms of spare-time education, flexible and diverse forms of teaching are adopted according to the needs of production. In order to enable workers to quickly master the technology of trial-producing new products, the factory opened crash training courses. Last year, it held 97 short-term technical training courses in drawing, technology, etc., and successfully completed the trial production tasks of new products. In the teaching of spare-time schools, part-work part-study, and full-time classes, every effort is made to incorporate some of the difficult problems encountered by workers in production into the teaching materials, which not only improves the cultural and technical level of workers but also solves technical problems in production. The cultural knowledge taught in the classroom is also linked to production practice as much as possible, making it easier for workers to understand and digest the teaching content. Because of the adherence to the combination of workers' education and production, the political, technical, and cultural level of workers has been effectively improved. The illiteracy and semi-literacy rate, which accounted for about half of the workers since 1953, has now been completely eliminated; the proportion of workers with a university education has increased from 2% to 6.7%; the proportion of workers with a senior high school or secondary technical education has increased from 6% to 14.3%; and the proportion of workers with a junior high school education has increased from 12% to 39.1%. Since 1953, the factory's spare-time schools have trained a total of 1,982 graduates and single-subject graduates of various grades, of which 15 workers have improved from primary school level to the level of one or two years of university, and 44 workers have improved from junior high school level to the level of two or three years of university. The improvement of the technical level of the factory's workers is particularly significant. Of the 2,238 apprentices who joined the factory in 1957, after one year of "three-combination" education, 60.5% are able to operate independently and work shifts with their masters, and 29.5% are able to assist their masters in production.

The improvement of workers' cultural and technical levels has promoted the vigorous development of scientific research activities throughout the factory. For example, the Xia Haojin Scientific Research Group used their brains in production and engaged in large-scale scientific research, creating a pneumatic oil valve flat lapping machine, which transformed manual operation into mechanization and increased production efficiency by 185 times. Zhang Shaoling, a milling worker who persisted in year-round spare-time learning, improved more than a dozen tools over the years due to his mastery of scientific and cultural knowledge. Wu Guangxiang was a tracer in 1953, but now he has become a designer and can independently design tools. He Zhenjia used the principle of cold contraction and thermal expansion in physics to solve key problems in inspection work and was named a factory labor model and advanced producer for two consecutive years. In 1958, the factory's workers broke through 51 major technical bottlenecks and wrote 113 technical summaries, enabling the factory to complete its 1958 total output value plan 45 days ahead of schedule, realizing an all-round Great Leap Forward in production, spare-time education, and scientific research work.

    生产、学习、科学研究三结合
    东安机械厂建成完整教育体系和科学研究网
    据黑龙江日报消息　东安机械厂在党的总路线光辉照耀下，一年来，坚持以生产为主，大办职工业余教育，大搞群众性的科学研究，大大地提高了职工的政治、技术和文化水平，为国家培养了技术人材，促进了生产的发展，使工厂初步形成了生产劳动、学习和科学研究“三结合”的基地。
    东安机械厂几年来在职工业余教育方面，一直就是黑龙江省的先进单位。随着1958年的生产大跃进，该厂党委在进一步加强职工业余教育工作的同时，还特别加强了对群众性的科学技术研究工作的领导。目前全厂已形成了从小学、中学到大学的完整的业余教育体系，去年全厂职工的平均就学率已达总人数的87％左右，出席率达85％。厂办的有大学、中学、中等专业等共四十个班（其中包括业余、半工半读、脱产等各种类型的班级）；车间办了二十五所初中以下的分校，共一百四十四个班级。全厂政治理论学习也空前活跃，仅参加哲学学习的工人就有两千六百名。科学研究网遍及各科室、车间、小组，其中有三十九个科学小组、二百五十余人经常进行研究活动。
    东安机械厂党委采取了统一领导、统一组织、统一安排的方法，以生产为主，把生产、业余教育和科学研究三者密切结合起来。在党的领导下，该厂设立了职工教育委员会、科学研究委员会，各车间有职工教育分会和科学研究分会，分别由车间人事副主任、技术副主任担任领导，这样就从组织上保证了三者紧密结合。同时，厂和车间的党组织在讨论和部署每个时期生产任务的同时，也对业余教育和科学研究工作做出了具体安排，使其能够更好地为生产服务。
    这个厂的业余教育和科学研究工作与生产结合、为生产服务的具体作法是，围绕着年、季、月的工厂和车间生产计划，提出科学研究课题，开展技术学习和文化学习。在业余教育方面，根据生产的需要，采取了灵活多样的形式进行教学。为了使职工能够迅速掌握试制新产品的技术，该厂开办了速成训练班，去年曾连续举办了制图、工艺等九十七个短期技术训练班，顺利地完成了新产品试制任务。在业余学校、半工半读、脱产班的教学中，都尽量把工人在生产中遇到的一些疑难问题编入教材进行讲授，既提高了工人的文化和技术水平，也解决了生产中的技术问题。在课堂上讲授的文化知识，也都尽量联系生产实际，使工人容易理解和消化教学内容。由于坚持了职工教育和生产相结合，有效地提高了工人政治、技术、文化水平。1953年以来占职工中一半左右的文盲和半文盲，现在已全部扫除；职工中具有大学文化程度的由2％上升到了6．7％；高中、中等技术程度的职工，由6％上升到14．3％；初中程度的由12％上升到了39．1％。1953年以来，该厂业余学校培养出来的各年级毕业和单科毕业生共一千九百八十二人，其中有十五名职工由原来小学程度提高到了大学一、二年程度，四十四名职工由原来初中程度提高到大学二、三年程度。全厂职工技术水平的提高尤为显著。1957年新进厂的二千二百三十八名徒工，一年来经过“三结合”教育后，已有60．5％的人能够独立操作和师傅倒班生产，29．5％的人可以配合师傅进行生产了。
    由于职工的文化、技术水平提高，促进了全厂科学研究活动蓬勃地开展。如夏浩金科学研究小组在生产中开动脑筋，大搞科学研究，创造了风动油阀平面研磨机，使手工操作变为机械化，提高了生产效率一百八十五倍。坚持常年业余学习的铣工张绍令，由于掌握了科学文化知识，几年来改进了十几种工具。武广祥在1953年还是一个描图员，现在已经成为一个设计员，能独立地设计工具了。何振家运用物理学的冷缩热涨原理，解决了检验工作中的关键问题，连续两年被评为厂劳动模范和先进生产者。1958年全厂职工共突破了重大技术关键五十一项，写出了一百一十三份技术总结，从而使该厂提前四十五天完成了1958年的总产值计划，实现了生产、业余教育和科学研究工作的全面大跃进。
