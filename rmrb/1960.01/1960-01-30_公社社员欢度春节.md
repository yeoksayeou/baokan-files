Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 29th: The hometown of national agricultural labor models Li Shunda and Shen Jilan—the Xigou People's Commune in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province—is filled with joy for the Spring Festival.

On the first day of the Lunar New Year, snowflakes were falling from the sky. After a burst of gongs, male and female commune members, supporting the old and carrying the young, headed from all directions to the public canteens to participate in the festive meals. Each household gathered around a table, and those who liked to drink formed separate tables. Each public canteen also specially set up VIP seats for production pacesetters. The sounds of toasting and congratulations intertwined in the dining halls, creating a lively atmosphere. The eight elderly people in the Home of Respect for the Elderly dined with the commune cadres. While eating the most treasured "Eight Bowls" dishes of the local area, the elderly talked endlessly about their happy lives in their later years. Before the Spring Festival, the commune provided each elderly person with new bedding and repainted their houses. The elderly all felt that they were getting younger and younger.

At dusk, the mountain village lit up with electric lights. Suddenly, good news came from the loudspeakers: a Spring Festival Gala would be held at the new stage in the evening, with a joint celebration with the workers from the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant. Upon hearing the broadcast, commune members walked towards the theater in groups of twos and threes. Mass self-composed, self-sung, and self-performed programs began, including fast-clapper talk, solo singing, and song and dance performances. The songs and dances performed by the kindergarten children were especially praised by the commune members and workers.

The Xigou People's Commune members overcame more than seventy days of severe drought and multiple wind, hail, and insect disasters last year, achieving an average grain yield of 414 jin per mu, and the production of forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations also increased several times over. Before the Spring Festival, the entire commune set a new leaping-forward plan for this year to achieve a grain yield of 550 jin per mu and an average income of 200 yuan per person. This plan inspired every commune member with the confidence to advance victoriously.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 29th: The Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei Province—at the foot of the Great Wall—the original "Poor Stick Cooperative" led by Wang Guofan was a production team of this commune. This year's Spring Festival is being celebrated with more excitement than in previous years.

The Jianming People's Commune, surrounded by mountains, raised the red flag of continuous revolution and carried forward the glorious tradition of running the commune diligently and thriftily. All commune members worked hard for more than fifty days from December of last year until the Spring Festival, so that some of the projects to divert water up the mountains were basically completed. In particular, over seventy kilometers of high-voltage power lines were newly erected from Fengrun Chengguan in Tangshan City to the Jianming Commune, lighting up ten thousand electric lights throughout the commune, and wired broadcasting was also sent to each production team, giving the poor mountain valley a new look. Commune members began to celebrate this year's Spring Festival under these circumstances.

Before the Spring Festival, the streets and alleys of each production team were cleaned thoroughly, and every household posted new Spring Festival couplets and New Year pictures, and hung up portraits of Chairman Mao. Colorful slogans were hung on the streets. Everywhere was fresh, clean, comfortable, and pleasant during this traditional festival.

On New Year's Eve, the public canteens of each production team prepared a rich dinner, and all the commune members of the team ate together. After the meal, the commune members also received mutton filling to make dumplings at home, while making dumplings, they talked about old stories and new things. Wang Sheng, who had begged for more than twenty years before liberation, listened to the radio with his family under the electric light, made dumplings, and studied the measures for the "Red Start" after the festival. Tong Kui, one of the twenty-three poor peasant households who started the cooperative with three donkey legs, made dumplings with his whole family. His whole family worked eight hundred workdays last year, and this year they plan to work one thousand workdays.

On the first day of the Lunar New Year, as soon as it began to dawn, deafening firecrackers sounded in each production team. At this time, the commune party secretary went to the homes of martyrs' families and military dependents to congratulate them on the New Year. Many male and female commune members in festive costumes visited each other to pay New Year's greetings. On this day, each production team also held rich and colorful cultural performances, including dragon dances, stilt walking, ugly carts, and donkey riding. The streets were filled with gongs and drums all day long, creating a festive atmosphere. The commune members rested well, had fun, and recharged their energy, preparing for a "Red Start" after the festival.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 29th: The Qiliying People's Commune in the suburbs of Xinxiang City, Henan Province, is filled with festive joy for the Spring Festival.

On Lunar New Year's Eve, as soon as night fell, the commune power plant lit up thousands of lights for the commune members. More than a thousand broadcasting loudspeakers broadcast festive songs. After eating New Year's Eve dumplings in the public canteen, the commune members, following the rhythm of the music, gathered at the club from all directions.

On this evening, the commune's thirty-one amateur theater troupes performed at the same time. The poetry competition square was also very lively, showing the film "The Fairy Couple," with girls and daughters-in-law as the main audience. A poetry competition of several hundred people had also been held in the square a few days earlier. He Wanquan's family of eleven, his daughter-in-law and daughter went to see a movie, and Grandpa He happily watched his theater troupe perform "The Flower of Water Conservancy." The eldest son, He Gong'an, is a Communist Party member. He only returned home after the water conservancy project was completed. After eating dumplings, he rushed to a meeting to study the "Red Start" in production after the festival. Grandma He was alone at home, sewing the last two buttons on her old partner's new clothes under the electric light.

On the morning of the first day of the Lunar New Year, after eating New Year's dumplings, the commune members gathered in groups of twos and threes at the square to participate in group New Year's greetings. Zhang Jianmin, the first secretary of the Xinxiang Prefectural Party Committee, Zhang Chao, the secretary of the Secretariat, and Zhang Subin, the first secretary of the Xinxiang Municipal Party Committee, also came to congratulate the commune members on the New Year. They first went to the Home of Respect for the Elderly. Lu Lianchen, an eighty-year-old man with a ruddy complexion, took Zhang's hand and said, "After the people's commune was established, I, an old man with no one to rely on, have found myself in a haven of happiness." He told Zhang about the situation when Chairman Mao came to Qiliying to inspect the work the year before last, and asked Zhang to tell Chairman Mao that they were having a Spring Festival that was satisfying in every way.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, January 29th: More than 31,000 Miao commune members of the Kaili People's Commune in Kaili Town, the capital of the Qian Southeast Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, and more than 6,000 Han commune members joyfully spent the first day of the Spring Festival together on the 28th. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, every village was cleaned thoroughly. People put on new festive clothes, and the girls dressed up even more beautifully, preparing to participate in "Lusheng Dance," "Bronze Drum Dance," and "Youfang" (courting rituals). Firecrackers sounded incessantly in the streets and alleys. In the afternoon, rich and colorful festive activities began. The young men came to the square with lusheng in hand, and the girls in Miao costumes followed closely behind. With the harmonious sound of the lusheng, the young men and women danced gracefully. The newly added hunting, basketball, and table tennis competitions attracted crowds of young people. Movie theaters and theaters were also the most crowded places.

At dusk, pairs of young men and women "Youfang" (courting rituals) on the hillside and by the villages, talking about love, singing and laughing to their heart's content. The famous Miao flying songs on the Qingshui River rose and fell, making the festival even more filled with a happy atmosphere.

The total industrial and agricultural output value of the Kaili People's Commune last year increased by 47% compared with 1958, and the income of commune members increased. People spent this traditional festival joyfully with the joy of harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, January 29th: During the Spring Festival, the Wannianhong People's Commune in the suburbs of Changsha City, Hunan Province, was filled with gongs and drums, and firecrackers were set off everywhere. Commune members played dragon lanterns and lion dances according to traditional customs, happily celebrating the Spring Festival.

Early in the morning on the first day of the Lunar New Year, male and female commune members in festive costumes, and New Year's greeting teams performing lion dances and dragon lanterns, went to the Commune Party Committee to congratulate them on the Spring Festival, beating drums and gongs. The small square in front of the Commune Party Committee was instantly bustling. The sound of firecrackers never stopped, and the sound of gongs and drums grew louder and louder. The commune members performing the dragon lanterns used the dragon's body to form large characters: "Long live the People's Commune!" "Long live the Great Leap Forward!" "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Strive for a greater agricultural harvest this year!" The commune member who was leading everyone to dance the dragon's body and form the characters, named Zhou Kai, was a poor peasant in the past. After the establishment of the commune, his life has become better and better. Last year, his wage income alone was 194 yuan, and he also received a bonus of 30 yuan. Before the Spring Festival, he was the first to wash the dragon costume and organize everyone to play the dragon lantern.

In the dragon lantern team, there were also many workers and students who returned home to celebrate the Spring Festival. Lu Jianlong, a worker from the Dongfeng Iron and Steel Rolling Plant, and Huang Yingming, a worker from the Changsha Water Pump Factory, all played with flying knives and drums together with the commune members to celebrate the New Year. They were originally farmers here, and only entered the factory during the Great Leap Forward in Steel Production in 1958. Since 1958, more than 120 farmers from this commune have entered the factories. Yesterday's farmers have become today's workers, and the joy of the worker-peasant get-together is even stronger.
