Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 28th: The National Conference to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" decided at its meeting today to hold large-scale demonstrations throughout Japan in early February and early March to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and to defend livelihoods and rights.

    At the meeting, attended by representatives of local anti-U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" conferences from various parts of Japan, the National Conference's program of action to prevent the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" was adopted.

    The program of action stipulates that the contingents participating in the large-scale demonstrations to prevent revision of the "Security Treaty" and defend livelihoods and rights will march from towns and villages in each prefecture to the prefectural government seat. At the same time, anti-"Security Treaty" struggle organizations in each prefecture will hold small gatherings and collect signatures.

    The program of action also calls on local anti-"Security Treaty" conferences to combine the struggle to support the various demands of people from all walks of life with the movement against revising the "Security Treaty" and for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. At the end of the marches in each prefecture, mass rallies will be held, demanding that prefectural governments and local assemblies make efforts to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," support disarmament and the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and take measures to improve the living standards of residents.

    To link up with the signature campaign against the "Security Treaty," the National Conference for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations will hold another signature campaign demanding the restoration of relations with China.

    The program of action stipulates that the 12th National Unified Action against the Revision of the "Security Treaty" will be held on February 25th, with the spring struggle launched by the workers of "Sohyo" (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan) and independent trade unions as its component part.

    In mid-March, a mass rally will be held with the participation of hundreds of thousands of people, with representatives sent from various regions.

    The program of action states that in mid-April, when the debate on the new "Security Treaty" in the Japanese Diet enters its final stage, the nationwide struggle will reach a climax, at which time the workers' strike action will be the core of this struggle.

    The National Conference also issued an appeal to the Japanese people at today's meeting. The appeal emphasized the need to strengthen the activities of the Japanese people, who already have eight hundred local anti-"Security Treaty" conferences. The appeal called on the Japanese people to redouble their efforts to bring about the dissolution of the Japanese Diet, overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet, and fundamentally change the political structure of Japan.
