The communiqué pointed out that in 1959, the total value of Soviet industrial output increased by more than 11% compared to 1958. Among them, the production of means of production (according to preliminary statistics) increased by 12%, and the production of consumer goods increased by 10.3%. The entire industrial production exceeded the original annual growth rate (7.7%), with an excess production of nearly 50 billion rubles worth of products. The growth rate of industrial production greatly exceeded the average annual growth rate stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan.

The communiqué went on to point out that last year, all Soviet republics and all national economic committees overfulfilled the total industrial output value plan and the annual production plans for most important products.

The communiqué stated that in 1959, the Soviet Union produced 43 million tons of pig iron, an increase of 9% compared to 1958; steel – 59.9 million tons, an increase of 9%; rolled steel – 47 million tons, an increase of 9%; iron ore – 94.4 million tons, an increase of 6%; oil – 129.5 million tons, an increase of 14%; electricity – 264 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 12%; man-made and synthetic fibers – 179,000 tons, an increase of 8%; metal-cutting machine tools – 146,000 units, an increase of 5%.

In 1959, the Soviet Union designed and manufactured more than 2,000 important new types of machines, machinery, equipment, and other equipment.

Due to the overfulfillment of the industrial product production plan and the task of reducing industrial product costs, the profits obtained by Soviet industry last year exceeded the original planned targets, with last year's profits being more than 20% higher than in 1958.

The communiqué stated that, according to preliminary statistics, the Soviet Union's grain harvest in 1959 was 7.6 billion poods (equivalent to 124.8 million tons), which meets the consumption needs of Soviet residents this year and other needs of the country. The total grain harvest increased by 700 million poods compared to the average annual output during the period from 1954 to 1958.

And in 1959, the Soviet Union surpassed the United States in terms of animal oil production per capita.

The communiqué pointed out that the reorganization of machine tractor stations in the Soviet Union has been completed. From the beginning of the reorganization in 1958 to 1959, Soviet collective farms have purchased tractors, machines, and equipment worth 32 billion rubles. In the past two years, collective farms across the country have purchased a total of 660,000 tractors, approximately 300,000 grain combine harvesters, and many other machines and equipment.

Last year, agriculture obtained 234,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower).

The communiqué then talked about the situation of basic construction in the Soviet Union last year. The communiqué stated that the total investment in basic construction by state and cooperative organizations last year (excluding the investment of collective farms) was 275 billion rubles, an increase of 12% compared to 1958. In one year, more than 1,000 large-scale state-owned industrial enterprises were completed and put into production across the country, and many new workshops were also put into production in the original enterprises.
