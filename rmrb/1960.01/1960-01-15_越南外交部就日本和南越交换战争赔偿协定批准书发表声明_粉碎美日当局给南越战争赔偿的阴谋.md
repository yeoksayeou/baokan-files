Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 14th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today condemning the Kishida Nobusuke government of Japan and the South Vietnamese authorities for exchanging ratification documents in Tokyo on January 12 regarding a one-sided provision of war reparations to the South Vietnamese authorities.

The statement said that the above collusion is aimed at continuing to realize the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to use Japan to infiltrate South Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into a U.S. military base in order to prepare to launch a war, destroy the Geneva Accords, and permanently divide Vietnam.

The statement said that the above-mentioned actions of the Kishida Nobusuke government and the South Vietnamese authorities violate the interests of the Japanese people, damage the interests of the Vietnamese people, and have an adverse impact on the inherent friendship between the people of Vietnam and Japan. The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly believes that for the benefit of the Japanese and Vietnamese people, and for the friendly relations between the two nations of Vietnam and Japan, the Vietnamese and Japanese people will resolutely continue to struggle to crush the conspiracy harbored by U.S. imperialism and the Kishida Nobusuke government in unilaterally providing war reparations to the South Vietnamese authorities.

    越南外交部就日本和南越交换战争赔偿协定批准书发表声明
    粉碎美日当局给南越战争赔偿的阴谋
    新华社河内14日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天发表声明，谴责日本岸信介政府和南越当局1月12日在东京交换关于片面给予南越当局战争赔偿的协定的批准书。
    声明说，上述勾当是为了继续实现美帝国主义利用日本渗入南越、把南越变成美国的军事基地的阴谋，以便准备发动战争，破坏日内瓦协议，长期分裂越南。
    声明说，岸信介政府和南越当局的上述行为违反了日本人民的利益，损害了越南人民的利益，对越日两国人民固有的友谊产生不良影响。声明说，越南民主共和国政府深信，为了日本人民和越南人民的利益，为了越日两民族的友好关系，越南人民和日本人民将坚决地继续进行斗争，粉碎美帝国主义和岸信介政府在片面给予南越当局战争赔偿中所包藏的阴谋。
