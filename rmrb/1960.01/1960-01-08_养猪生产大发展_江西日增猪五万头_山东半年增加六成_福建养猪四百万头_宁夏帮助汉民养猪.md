　　Great Development in Pig Production
　　Jiangxi Increases by 50,000 Pigs Daily; Shandong Increases by 60% in Half a Year; Fujian Raises 4 Million Pigs; Ningxia Helps Han People Raise Pigs

　　This newspaper reports that Jiangxi Province's pig production is developing rapidly, with a daily increase of 56,000 pigs. The mass movement to "Learn from Yushan, catch up with Yushan, and surpass Yushan" in pig raising in the province has initially blossomed.

　　In mid-December 1959, Yushan County took the lead in the province in achieving one pig per mu of land. The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all parts of the province to learn from and promote Yushan County's experience in pig raising and vigorously develop animal husbandry production centered on pig raising. Subsequently, a pig raising competition craze of "Learn from Yushan, catch up with Yushan, and surpass Yushan" quickly swept the province, and the number of pigs raised soared. In the half-month from December 15th of last year to January 1st of this year, the province increased by 800,000 pigs, an average daily increase of more than 50,000 pigs. Following Yushan County's achievement of one pig per mu of land, another fifteen people's communes and two hundred and fifty-eight production brigades in the province achieved one pig per mu of land; Taihe and Hengfeng counties and thirteen communes and two hundred and fifty production brigades also achieved one pig per person.

　　In the pig raising competition craze, Party committees at all levels in Jiangxi widely organized cadres and commune members to carefully study Yushan County's experience in developing pig raising at high speed. According to Yushan County's experience, the key to whether pig raising can develop at high speed is to have a great revolutionary drive and to adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously launching mass movements. After recognizing this key, cadres and masses in various places specifically discussed the issues of catching up with and surpassing Yushan, formulated measures to accelerate the development of pig raising, and quickly set off a competition craze. After the masses were mobilized, they smoothly overcame difficulties such as pig sties, pig sources, and feed in the high-speed development of pig raising. The people's communes in Xingan County mobilized commune members to come up with ideas and find ways to build 440 breeding farms in twelve days using old bricks, tiles, old wood, and old houses. Yichun County adopted the "five-level pig raising" method of county raising, commune raising, brigade raising, team raising, and household raising, building more than 5,000 pig sties and developing 100,000 pigs in half a month. In the past half month, Gan County in the Gannan District has increased by more than 13,000 new sows, and the full pregnancy rate of old sows has increased from 70% in the past to 91%, breeding more than 22,000 piglets. At present, Jiangxi Province has established 100,000 breeding farms, an increase of 30,000 from half a month ago; the number of pigs raised has increased by 1 million from a month ago.

　　This newspaper reports that pig raising in Shandong Province is developing rapidly. At present, the number of pigs in stock in the province has increased by about 65% compared with the first half of 1959. There are ten communes in the province that have reached or exceeded one pig per person; there are one hundred and ten production teams and one hundred and thirty production teams that have reached or exceeded one pig per mu.

　　The rapid development of pig raising in Shandong Province is the result of Party committees at all levels further emphasizing and strengthening leadership in this work. In addition to establishing livestock committees in a timely manner, headed by the Party secretary, Party committees at all levels have also paid attention to grasping base points, inserting red flags, setting up pacesetters, and vigorously developing a pig raising competition craze. Linyi Prefecture overfulfilled its production plan of 2 million pigs twenty-one days ahead of schedule, and Liaocheng Prefecture overfulfilled its annual plan by more than 20%.

　　Another important reason for the rapid development of pig raising is that various places have closely relied on the superiority of the people's communes and conscientiously implemented the principle of giving priority to public raising and combining public and private raising. In areas such as Linyi, Yantai, and Liaocheng, the proportion of collective pig raising has increased to about 60% due to the conscientious implementation of this principle. Various places have also combined high-yield fields and high-yield plots to build pig farms and develop collective pig raising. Since November, the province has built more than 66,300 new pig farms, bringing the total number of pig farms to more than 116,300, with an average of more than 84 pig farms per commune in the province, creating favorable conditions for further developing collective pig raising.

　　This newspaper reports that Fujian Province has achieved great success in developing pig raising at high speed. To date, the province has raised more than 4,330,600 pigs, an increase of 41% compared with July 1959. Thirteen communes and three hundred and twenty-six brigades in the province have achieved one pig per person or one pig per mu.

　　In the pig raising and manure accumulation upsurge, pig raising leading bodies have been established from the province to the prefecture (city), county, commune, and team levels. Party committees at all levels have designated a secretary to take charge of pig raising, and cadres in many areas have run "pig raising experimental plots." According to statistics from Zhangpu and Ningde counties, more than 3,940 Party members and core members have been transferred to pig farms to strengthen the leadership of pig raising production.

　　This newspaper reports that the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has taken measures to launch a pig raising upsurge in Han people's communes.

　　In the past, many Han people in the Ningxia region did not have the habit of raising pigs. After local Party organizations publicized the benefits of developing pig raising and the dialectical relationship of mutual dependence and mutual promotion between developing agriculture and developing animal husbandry, the masses' confidence and enthusiasm for developing pig raising increased. In order to solve the difficulty in the source of piglets, people's communes in various places have also adopted methods such as retaining all sows and implementing timely mating, continuous mating, and double mating to improve the conception rate. In addition to establishing feed bases and using wasteland and alkaline land to grow feed, people's communes have also mobilized the masses to collect wild grass, sweep leaves, and store by-products of crops such as millet, soybeans, flax, buckwheat, and corn to make substitute feeds. Some communes also use idle land to graze pig herds block by block, which not only increases the pigs' activity and saves feed, but also increases the rate of weight gain.

    养猪生产大发展
    江西日增猪五万头　山东半年增加六成
    福建养猪四百万头　宁夏帮助汉民养猪
    本报讯　江西省生猪生产正以日增五万六千头的高速度向前发展，全省“学玉山、赶玉山、超玉山”养猪群众运动初放花朵。
    1959年12月中旬，玉山县在全省领先实现了一亩田一头猪，中共江西省委号召全省各地学习和推广玉山县的养猪经验，大力发展以养猪为中心的畜牧业生产。接着，一个“学玉山、赶玉山、超玉山”的养猪竞赛热潮迅速席卷全省，养猪头数飞跃上升。从去年12月15日到今年1月1日的半月内，全省增加了八十万头生猪，平均每天增加五万多头。继玉山县实现一亩田一头猪之后，全省又有十五个人民公社、二百五十八个生产大队实现了一亩田一头猪；还有泰和、横峰两县和十三个公社、二百五十个生产大队实现了一人养一头猪。
    在养猪竞赛热潮中，江西各级党委广泛组织干部和社员认真学习了玉山县高速度发展养猪事业的经验。根据玉山县的经验，养猪事业能否高速度发展的关键，是要有一股很大的革命干劲，要坚持政治挂帅和大搞群众运动。各地干部和群众在认清这个关键后，具体讨论了赶玉山、超玉山的问题，制定了加速发展养猪事业的措施，迅速掀起了竞赛热潮。群众发动起来以后，顺利地克服了高速度发展养猪事业中的猪舍、猪源、饲料等困难。新干县各人民公社发动社员出主意、想办法，利用旧砖瓦、旧木料和旧民房，十二天建起四百四十个饲养场。宜春县采取县养、公社养、大队养、小队养、户户养的“五级养猪”办法，半月内建起了五千多栋猪舍，发展生猪十万头。赣南区赣县在最近半月内，增加了一万三千多头新母猪，老母猪满怀率由过去70％提高到91％，繁殖小猪二万二千多只。现在，江西全省已办起十万个饲养场，比半月前增加了三万个；养猪头数比一个月前增加了一百万头。
    本报讯　山东省养猪事业突飞猛进。目前，全省存栏猪比1959年上半年增加了65％左右。全省达到或超过一人一头猪的公社有十个；达到或超过一亩一猪的生产队有一百一十个，生产小队一百三十个。
    山东省养猪事业的迅速发展，是各级党委进一步重视和加强对这个工作领导的结果。各级党委，除及时建立了畜牧委员会，由党委书记挂帅以外，还注意掌握基点，插红旗、树标兵，大力发展养猪的竞赛热潮。临沂专区提前二十一天超额完成二百万头猪的生产计划，聊城专区超额20％以上完成年计划。
    养猪事业迅速发展的另一个重要原因，是各地紧紧依靠了人民公社的优越性，认真贯彻了以公养为主，公养私养并举的方针。临沂、烟台、聊城等地区，由于认真贯彻了这一方针，集体养猪的比数都增加到60％左右。各地还结合丰产田、丰产方，大建养猪场，发展集体养猪。自11月份以来，全省新建养猪场六万六千三百多处，连同原有的养猪场共有十一万六千三百多处，全省平均每个公社有养猪场八十四处以上，为进一步发展集体养猪创造了有利条件。
    本报讯　福建省高速度发展养猪事业获得巨大成绩，到目前止，全省已养猪四百三十三万零六百多头，比1959年7月份增长了41％。全省已有十三个公社、三百二十六个大队实现了一人一猪或一亩一猪。
    在养猪积肥高潮中，从省到地（市）、县、社、队都建立了养猪领导机构。各级党委都指定一个书记挂帅大抓养猪，许多地区干部都办了“养猪试验田”。据漳浦、宁德两县统计，最近还抽调了党团员骨干三千九百四十多人下放养猪场加强养猪生产领导。
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区采取措施，在汉族人民公社中掀起养猪高潮。
    宁夏地区过去许多汉民都没有养猪的习惯。经过各地党组织宣传了关于发展养猪的好处和发展农业与发展畜牧业互相依存、互相促进的辩证关系以后，群众对发展养猪业的信心和热情高涨起来。为了解决仔猪来源的困难，各地人民公社还采取了母猪全留，实行及时配、连续配、双重配等办法，提高了受胎率。各人民公社除建立饲料基地和利用荒滩碱地种植饲料外，还发动广大群众采集野草、扫树叶，贮存糜谷、黄豆、胡麻、荞麦、玉米等农作物的副产品，作成代用饲料。有的公社还利用休闲地逐块放牧猪群，不仅增加了猪的活动，节省了饲料，而且还提高了长肉率。
