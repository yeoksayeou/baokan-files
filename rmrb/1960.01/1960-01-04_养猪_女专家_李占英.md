    The commune members of the Nanxu Management Area of the Qianjin People's Commune in Wenshui County, Shanxi Province, all praise the female Communist Party member Li Zhanying's love of raising pigs, calling her a "good daughter of the Party, a pig-raising woman expert." She truly lives up to her name. Since becoming a feeder in 1957, every one of the seven hundred pigs she has raised has been plump and meaty.

    Why is Li Zhanying able to raise pigs so well? People who don't understand might say, "It's hard to build a wall without soil; pigs are raised on grain. She must be feeding them a lot of grain." But that's not the case. Her total cost for feeding a pig weighing eighty catties is only five yuan. So, what is her secret to raising pigs? In a word, it is to make every effort to utilize alternative feed. For example, in the spring of 1957, when there was no bran and no wild vegetables had been collected, it was a lean season. At that time, the Chengguan Supply and Marketing Cooperative bought a batch of sugar beet pulp from other places. After Li Zhanying learned about it, she took the initiative to contact the supply and marketing cooperative and bought 30,000 catties to prepare as pig feed. Some people disagreed at the time. An old man said, "The pigs in West Street and North Street didn't eat this stuff when they bought it, and they all sent it back to the supply and marketing cooperative. You insist on feeding it, isn't that a waste of money!" Li Zhanying did not return the sugar beet pulp to the supply and marketing cooperative because of this, but carefully selected the sugar beet pulp, washed it clean, and then fermented it. As a result, the pigs loved to eat it. In July of this year, she went to the city to attend a fair, carrying a rope with her, and brought back a bundle of lamb's quarters when she returned. Usually, she always tries every possible way to collect the swill saved by each household. When she sees pumpkin pulp and watermelon rinds thrown away on the street, she always picks them up and processes them as pig feed.

    Li Zhanying has formed a set of scientific methods for raising pigs. Specifically, they are: four fixings, six diligences, three observations, four not minding, and ten not feeding. The four fixings are: fixed time, fixed quantity, fixed meal, and fixed trough; the six diligences are: diligently washing the trough, diligently padding the pen, diligently removing manure, diligently disinfecting, diligently cleaning, and diligently checking; the three observations are: observing for illness, observing the stool, observing the spirit; the four not minding are: not minding hardship, not minding dirt, not minding trouble, and not minding repairing the pen; the ten not feeding are: not feeding hot, not feeding cold, not feeding too much, not feeding too little, not feeding late, not feeding early, not feeding thick, not feeding thin, not feeding raw, not feeding dirty.

    Li Zhanying is not only a master of pig raising, but also a good doctor for pigs. In May of last year, a pig fell ill, its belly was very bloated, and its movements were abnormal. Li Zhanying carefully observed the pig's symptoms, repeatedly diagnosed it, and determined that the pig's disease was acute colitis. So she immediately went to the health center to buy medicine for the pig to take, and also gave the pig injections in its ears and limbs. In order to save the pig, she stayed in the pen for two whole nights. Another time, when she was feeding the pigs, she found that a piglet was not eating or drinking and was shaking all over. She immediately used needles to prick it, and after four hours, the piglet recovered. Last autumn, three sows gave birth to thirty-six piglets one after another. Coincidentally, there was a hog cholera epidemic. In order to do a good job in prevention, she carried out disinfection and isolation, so that the piglets did not develop hog cholera. Her experience in preventing and controlling hog cholera is: one prevention, two treatments, three resolutions, and four not padding. One prevention is: early prevention; two treatments are: early treatment, good treatment; three resolutions are: resolutely isolate, resolutely separate troughs, resolutely treat; four not padding are: do not pad with raw soil, do not pad with long grass, do not pad with coal ash, do not pad with wheat straw.

    Li Zhanying's mastery of pig breeding technology is also top-notch, with a 100% success rate. (Attached picture)

    养猪“女专家”李占英
    郭建武
    山西文水县前进人民公社南徐管理区的社员们，一提起女共产党员李占英热爱养猪的事迹，都夸她是“党的好女儿，养猪女专家。”真是名不虚传，李占英从1957年担任饲养员以来，经她喂养过的七百口猪，个个都是膘满肉肥。
    李占英为什么能够把猪喂得那么肥？不了解的人可能会说：“没土难打墙，猪凭粮食养，她一定是喂粮很多。”其实不然，她喂一口八十斤重的猪，全部成本只用五块钱。那么，她喂猪的妙诀是什么呢？一句话，就是千方百计地利用代饲料。比如在1957年春天，连糠皮都没有，野菜未积下，正是青黄不接的时候。当时城关供销社从外地买回一批糖萝卜渣。李占英知道后，便主动和供销社联系，买回来三万斤准备作猪饲料。这时有些人不同意。有个老汉说：“西街和北街买回来这东西猪不吃，都给供销社送回去了，你偏要喂，那不是白费钱！”李占英并没有因此把糖萝卜渣退给供销社，而是将糖萝卜渣细细地挑拣了一遍，淘洗干净，然后经过发酵，结果猪很爱吃。今年7月，她到城里赶会，随身带着绳子，回来时扛回一捆灰灰菜。在平时，她总要想尽一切办法把各家攒的泔水收集起来。见到街上扔着南瓜瓤、西瓜皮，她总要拣回来加工作为猪饲料。
    李占英喂猪已经形成了一套科学的方法。具体说来就是：四定、六勤、三看、四不嫌、十不喂。四定是：定时、定量、定顿、定槽；六勤是：勤洗槽、勤垫圈、勤出粪、勤消毒、勤打扫、勤检查；三看是：看毛病、看拉屎、看精神；四不嫌是：不嫌苦、不嫌脏、不嫌麻烦、不嫌修圈；十不喂是：热不喂、冷不喂、多不喂、少不喂、迟不喂、早不喂、稠不喂、稀不喂、生不喂、脏不喂。
    李占英不仅是喂猪的能手，而且也是猪的好医生。去年5月间，一口猪生了病，肚胀的很大，起卧不正常。李占英仔细观察猪的症状，反复诊断，弄清了猪的病是急性大肠炎，于是她立即到卫生院买了药让猪服下，又在猪的耳朵、四肢扎药针。为了救活这口猪，她整整在圈里守了两夜。又有一次，她给猪喂食时，发现一口小猪不吃不喝，浑身一直发抖，她马上就用针扎，过了四小时，小猪好了。去年秋天，有三口母猪先后下了三十六个猪娃，恰巧遇上猪瘟，她为了作好预防工作，进行了消毒、隔离，使猪娃没有发生猪瘟。在防治猪瘟方面，她的经验是：一防、二治、三坚决、四不垫。一防是：早预防；二治是：早治、治好；三坚决是：坚决隔离、坚决分槽、坚决治疗；四不垫是：不垫生土、不垫长草、不垫煤灰、不垫麦秸。
    李占英掌握猪的配种技术也是呱呱叫，百配百中。（附图片）
