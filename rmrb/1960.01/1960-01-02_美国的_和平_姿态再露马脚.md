America's "Peace" Posture Exposed Again
By a commentator of this newspaper

    U.S. President Eisenhower issued a statement on December 29, 1959, announcing that the U.S.'s voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing would expire on December 31st, after which the U.S. would have the freedom to resume nuclear weapons testing. Moreover, before formally resuming nuclear testing, the U.S. will continue its active program of research, development, and laboratory-scale weapon experiments. Eisenhower's statement is a blatant declaration that the U.S. will no longer be bound by the cessation of nuclear testing, and that the U.S. will resume nuclear testing whenever it completes preparations for such testing. This move by the U.S. cannot but cause deep unease among people of all countries who urgently demand a permanent cessation of nuclear testing and an end to the nuclear arms race.
    A permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing is an important step towards the prohibition of nuclear weapons. The attitude taken towards this issue is a sign of whether a country has peaceful sincerity. As early as March 31, 1958, the Soviet Union announced a unilateral halt to nuclear explosions and called on the United States and Britain to respond to this initiative, but they turned a deaf ear. On October 30 of the same year, on the eve of the Soviet-U.S.-British conference on discontinuing nuclear testing, the Soviet Union again proposed an immediate and permanent cessation of testing, but was again rejected by the U.S. and Britain. To cope with international public opinion at the time, the U.S. and Britain only announced a temporary suspension of testing for one year. On August 26 last year, as pressure from world public opinion for easing the international situation increased, the United States extended the one-year moratorium on nuclear weapons testing by two months to the end of December 1959. At that time, the Soviet Union stated that it was willing to sign an agreement with the United States and Britain immediately on the permanent cessation of all nuclear weapons tests, and stated that as long as Western countries did not resume atomic and hydrogen weapons tests before an agreement was reached, the Soviet Union would not resume nuclear explosions. The Soviet Union's actions were warmly welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world. People expected that Western countries would not only not resume nuclear testing, but also accept the Soviet Union's proposal and reach an agreement on a permanent cessation of nuclear testing. When Eisenhower spoke about the negotiations on the cessation of nuclear testing on December 2 last year, he also said: "We (the United States) do not only attach great importance to it, but also have more hope for these things than a few months ago." However, only twenty days later, the same Eisenhower showed the world that the United States was not only unwilling to permanently stop nuclear testing, but even unwilling to continue the so-called temporary suspension of testing. Even when the United States announced its so-called temporary one-year cessation of testing, fair-minded public opinion in some countries pointed out that this was only the preparation stage required by the United States between two tests. Hasn't this argument now been fully confirmed by Eisenhower's statement on December 29?
    However, in order to create an excuse for resuming nuclear testing, the United States is trying to shift the responsibility for the failure to reach a permanent cessation of nuclear testing agreement to the Soviet Union. Of course, this cannot deceive everyone who understands the truth. Everyone knows that the United States has always rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude a permanent cessation of nuclear testing agreement under the pretext that nuclear explosions cannot be detected. It was only because the Geneva Conference of Nuclear Experts, attended by American scientists in the summer of 1958, unanimously believed that it was possible to detect secret nuclear explosions, thus dispelling the excuse of the United States, that the United States had to participate in the Geneva Three-Nation Conference on Discontinuing Nuclear Weapons Testing, which began on October 31, 1958. However, the progress of the fourteen-month meeting showed that the United States and its partner Britain did not intend to reach any agreement. From the agenda and name of the meeting to the various substantive issues, the United States set up layers of obstacles to hinder the progress of the meeting. Thanks to the unremitting efforts of the Soviet delegation and the pressure of world public opinion, the Geneva Conference broke through some of the obstacles created by the United States and reached agreement on seventeen articles and a preamble to the treaty banning nuclear testing. However, on the most important issue of supervision, the United States blatantly demanded control of the supervisory机构 in order to achieve the purpose of espionage, which of course was unacceptable to the Soviet Union. Recently, the United States has once again brought out so-called "new seismic data" out of nowhere, insisting that it is difficult to detect underground nuclear explosions, attempting to retreat to the old and stubborn position of "if it cannot be detected, it cannot be supervised, and a treaty on the cessation of nuclear testing cannot be concluded." People of all countries can see very clearly that it is precisely the unreasonable obstruction of the United States that has caused the Geneva Conference on the Discontinuation of Nuclear Testing to fall into the state of "it is still not possible to reach a satisfactory agreement," as stated in Eisenhower's December 29 statement.
    The United States's efforts to reject the conclusion of a permanent cessation of nuclear testing agreement are inseparable from its adherence to the "Cold War" policy and its dream of rebuilding its nuclear weapons advantage. Since the Geneva Conference on the Discontinuation of Nuclear Testing was held, certain powerful groups in the United States have been clamoring that the cessation of nuclear testing would endanger the "security" of the United States, and they have openly demanded the abandonment of the U.S. government's promise of a temporary cessation of testing. In fact, the United States has long abandoned its own promises. According to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's own announcement, it had already conducted a series of underground tests of atomic weapons on December 17 and 19. Eisenhower's statement is merely preparing the United States to further publicly resume nuclear weapons testing. The United States is also clearly attempting to use "resuming nuclear testing at any time" to blackmail the Soviet Union, forcing the Soviet Union to make concessions in the Geneva talks on the cessation of nuclear testing, or to agree to allow the United States to control the supervisory機構, or to accept not including underground nuclear explosions in the scope of prohibited tests, both of which would facilitate the United States to continue developing nuclear weapons.
    This move by the United States to poison the international atmosphere and threaten peace is extremely contradictory to the peaceful posture that the United States has recently been trying so hard to adopt. When Eisenhower visited foreign countries not long ago, he repeatedly expressed the United States's sincerity in seeking peace and its desire to achieve disarmament. These peaceful words are still ringing in our ears, but now Eisenhower has announced the United States's decision to prepare to resume nuclear testing at any time. How can people not doubt the sincerity of the United States's peace declarations? How can people not think that the United States is using a smokescreen of peace to cover up its activities of stepping up arms expansion and war preparations?

    美国的“和平”姿态再露马脚
    本报评论员
    美国总统艾森豪威尔于1959年12月29日发表声明，宣布美国自愿的停止核试验的期限于12月31日满期，此后美国有恢复核武器试验的自由。而且在正式恢复核试验之前，美国将继续执行它的研究、发展和以试验室形式实验武器的积极计划。艾森豪威尔的这一声明，是公然表示美国将不再受停止核试验的约束，什么时候美国完成了核试验的准备工作，什么时候美国就恢复核试验。美国的这一举动不能不引起迫切要求永久停止核试验、结束核军备竞赛的各国人民的深深不安。
    永久停止核武器试验，是导向禁止核武器的一个重要步骤。对这个问题采取什么样的态度，是考验一个国家是否具有和平诚意的一个标志。远在1958年3月31日，苏联就宣布单方面停止核爆炸，并呼吁美国和英国响应这个倡议，但是它们竟置若罔闻。同年10月30日，在苏美英三国举行不继续核试验会议的前夕，苏联再建议立即永久停止试验，但又遭到美英两国的拒绝。为了应付当时的国际舆论，美英只宣布暂时停止试验一年。去年8月26日，由于全世界舆论要求缓和国际局势的压力日益增强，美国又把停止核武器试验一年的期限延长两个月到1959年12月底。当时，苏联声明愿意立即同美、英两国签订关于永久停止各种核武器试验的协议，并且表示在达成协议之前，只要西方国家不恢复原子武器和氢武器试验，苏联将不恢复核爆炸。苏联的行动受到全世界爱好和平人们的热烈欢迎。人们期望西方国家不但不要恢复核试验，而且能够接受苏联的建议，达成永久停止核试验的协议。艾森豪威尔在去年12月2日谈到停止核试验的谈判时，还说过：“我们（美国）确实不只非常重视它，而且比几个月以前对这些事情抱有希望”。但是，仅仅相隔二十多天，同一个艾森豪威尔就向全世界表明，美国不但不愿永久停止核试验，而且连所谓暂时停止试验都不愿意继续下去了。还在美国宣布它的所谓暂时停止试验一年的时候，有些国家的公正舆论就曾指出，这只不过是美国在两次试验中间所必需的准备工作阶段，这一论断现在不是完全为艾森豪威尔12月29日的声明所证实了吗？
    然而，美国为了给自己恢复核试验制造借口，竟想把迄今未能达成永久停止核试验的协议的责任推到苏联身上。这当然是欺骗不了一切明白事情真相的人的。大家知道，美国一向借口核爆炸不能侦查出来而拒绝苏联关于缔结永久停止核试验协定的建议。只是由于1958年夏季有美国科学家参加的日内瓦核专家会议一致认为侦查秘密的核爆炸是可能的，解除了美国的借口，美国才不得不参加从1958年10月31日开始的日内瓦不继续核武器试验三国会议。但是，十四个月的会议进展情况表明，美国和它的伙伴英国并不打算达成任何协议。从会议的议程和名称问题一直到各项实质问题，美国都布设了层层的障碍，阻挠会议的进展。由于苏联代表团的不懈努力和世界公众舆论的压力，日内瓦会议才突破了美国所制造的一些障碍，就禁止核试验的条约的十七条条文和一个序言达成了协议。但是在最主要的监督问题上，美国露骨地要求控制监督机构以达到刺探情报的目的，这当然是苏联所不能接受的。最近美国又无端搬出什么“新的地震资料”来，硬说在地下进行核爆炸是难以侦查出来的，企图退回到“既无法侦查，就难以监督，就不能缔结停止核试验的协定”那个陈旧而顽固的立场上去。各国人民看得很清楚，正是美国的无理阻挠，才使得日内瓦不继续核试验会议陷于艾森豪威尔12月29日声明中所说的“现在还看不出能达成圆满的协议”的状态。
    美国竭力拒绝缔结永久停止核试验的协定，是同它的坚持“冷战”政策分不开的，同它的企图重建核武器优势的梦想分不开的。自从日内瓦不继续核试验会议举行以来，美国某些有势力集团一直在叫嚷什么停止核试验将危及美国的“安全”，他们公开要求废弃美国政府的关于暂时停止试验的诺言。事实上，美国根本早就废弃了自己的诺言。根据美国原子能委员会自己所宣布的，它在12月17日和19日就已先后进行了一系列的原子武器地下试验。艾森豪威尔的声明不过是为美国进一步公开恢复核武器作准备罢了。美国显然还企图用“随时恢复核试验”来对苏联进行讹诈，要苏联在日内瓦停止核试验的谈判中让步，或者同意让美国控制监督机构，或者接受不把地下核爆炸列入禁止试验的范围，二者都可以便于美国继续发展核武器。
    美国这种毒化国际气氛和威胁和平的举动，是同美国最近所竭力装扮的和平姿态极端矛盾的。艾森威豪尔不久以前出国访问的时候，一再表示美国对谋求和平的诚意和对实现裁军的愿望，这种和平词令言犹在耳，现在艾森豪威尔却又宣布了美国准备随时恢复核试验的决定。人们怎能不怀疑美国的和平表示是虚假的呢？人们怎能不认为美国是用和平的烟幕来掩盖它加紧扩军备战的活动呢？
