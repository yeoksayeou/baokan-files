Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: The Ministry of Culture recently issued a notice on carrying out the 1960 Spring Festival cultural work, requiring cultural departments in all regions to prepare early and vigorously carry out Spring Festival cultural and recreational activities.

    The notice requires the China Film Distribution Company and film distribution companies in all regions to make good arrangements for the film needs of factories, mines, rural areas, construction sites, and troops, so that the broad masses can see more and better films during the Spring Festival. When making rounds, film projection teams in various regions should pay attention to suburban areas, villages and towns with concentrated populations, and construction sites, while also paying attention to mountainous areas, pastoral areas, and remote small factories and mines with scattered populations. They should select more suitable and good feature films, newsreels, documentaries, and science and educational films and supply them in a timely and adequate manner. All cinemas, film clubs, and film projection teams should carefully plan and specifically arrange film screenings so that the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and children can see satisfactory films.

    The notice requires professional art performance groups in various regions to not only do well in urban theater performances during the Spring Festival to meet the needs of urban people, but also to spend more time selecting a batch of excellent programs loved by the masses and suitable for Spring Festival performances (including programs presented as gifts for the 10th anniversary of the National Day) and go deep into rural areas, industrial and mining areas, construction sites, and troops for touring performances. During the touring performances, they should provide guidance to mass amateur art activities.

    Regarding mass amateur cultural and recreational activities, the notice requires clubs, cultural centers (stations), amateur cultural and artistic troupes, and amateur theater troupes in rural people's communes, factories, mines, enterprises, and urban neighborhoods to, under the leadership of the Party committee, closely coordinate with political propaganda based on the needs and voluntary participation of the masses and the principle of diligence and thrift in running affairs, and widely mobilize the masses and folk artists to carry out diverse, healthy, and beneficial amateur cultural and recreational activities. Depending on the specific circumstances, hold small-scale joint performances, and hold evening parties in coordination with worker-peasant get-togethers, army-civilian get-togethers, and activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers.

    The notice also requires doing a good job in distributing and recommending Spring Festival literary and artistic singing materials, New Year pictures, and other popular reading materials suitable for use in factories, mines, and rural areas, supplying lantern slides for Spring Festival screenings as early as possible, and using proactive recommendation and delivery methods to promote good lantern slides with educational significance that are coordinated with water conservancy construction, pig raising and manure accumulation, and singing praises of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. Libraries in various regions should conduct book exhibition activities and organize lectures, reports, story meetings, and reader get-togethers. Cultural administrative departments, cultural centers, and museums in various regions should help people's communes organize and strengthen the work of exhibition halls (rooms), with the content focusing on displaying contrasts between past and present life, the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, agricultural modernization, technological innovation, bumper harvest experiences, advanced figures, and advanced deeds.
