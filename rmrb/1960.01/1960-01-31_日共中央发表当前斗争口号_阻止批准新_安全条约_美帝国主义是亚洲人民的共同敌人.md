Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th – The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party today published the current struggle slogans in the "Akahata" newspaper. These slogans were adopted at the five-day Eighth Central Committee Plenum of the Japanese Communist Party, which began on January 22.

    The main contents of the slogans are: prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," abolish the "Security Treaty"; dissolve the Diet, hold general elections, and overthrow the traitorous and reactionary Nobusuke Kishi cabinet. The slogans point out that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Asian people; demand that the United States withdraw U.S. military bases from Japan and withdraw U.S. troops.

    The slogans express support for the Soviet Union's proposal for complete disarmament and arms reduction; demand that the Diet and local assemblies pass resolutions supporting disarmament.

    The slogans call on the Japanese people to shatter the Kishi Nobusuke government's anti-China and anti-Soviet policies; strive to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China and conclude a Japanese-Soviet peace treaty.

    The struggle slogans express opposition to U.S. nuclear armament of Japan and demand that the United States return Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands. The struggle slogans also express opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the constitution and the enactment of reactionary laws that deprive the people of freedom, opposition to increased military spending, and advocate the dissolution of the existing Japanese army.

    In the struggle slogans, the Japanese Communist Party calls on the Japanese people to strive to establish joint struggle organizations of all patriotic and democratic forces, including the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, in all posts and cities, towns, villages, and schools, and to develop joint struggle organizations and unified actions of democratic forces.

    Finally, in the slogans, the Japanese Communist Party calls on all people who desire national security and independence, peace, neutrality, to rise up and participate in the unified action to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," and to make every effort to establish a national democratic united front in order to build a peaceful, independent, democratic, neutral, and prosperous Japan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th – The Japan-China Friendship Association today decided to designate March and April of this year as "Action Months for Breaking the Deadlock in Japan-China Relations and Preventing the Ratification of the Revised Security Treaty."

    By carrying out this movement, the Japan-China Friendship Association will actively participate in the nationwide struggle led by the National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to oppose the Diet's ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Association decided to prepare for the two-month movement in February.

    This decision was made at the standing board meeting of the Japan-China Friendship Association held today.

    The Association decided that during the movement, it will take various actions to publicize the necessity of restoring diplomatic relations with China. Among the planned actions are small gatherings, discussions, signature campaigns, sending postcards, fundraising campaigns, and distributing leaflets.

    During the Action Months, the Association will also expose the crimes committed by Nobusuke Kishi against China in the past. At the same time, the Association will force the Japanese government to recognize a list of Chinese victims who were abducted to Japan and died in Japan, which the Association has just completed. During this period, ceremonies will also be held to commemorate the Chinese victims.
