Great progress has been made in ideological content, form, and production technology, making this ancient art flower, which is loved by the masses, bloom with new vitality. Many puppet show and shadow play troupes have gone to the countryside and the cities to perform for the masses, achieving great success in educating the masses and meeting their cultural needs. The ideological awareness of the vast number of artists has also been greatly improved. Many outstanding veteran artists have joined the Party, and many young actors have joined the League. During this performance, symposiums will also be held to discuss further implementing the Party's literary and artistic policies, improving the ideological and artistic quality of the plays, carrying out technological innovation, and training young actors, in order to summarize experiences, clarify the direction, and promote the continuous leap forward of China's puppet show and shadow play, and better serve socialist construction.
