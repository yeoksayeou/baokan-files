The Great Leap Forward Opens Up New Fields for Cultivating Construction Talent

    Six Hundred Newly Built Institutions Consolidated and Improved

    With the exception of the Tibet region, all provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and even the vast majority of special districts across the country now have institutions of higher learning. The newly built institutions of higher learning have started from scratch, practiced diligence and frugality in running schools, and have generally taken shape, establishing Party committees and assigning full-time secretaries. These schools have generally established teaching systems, established teaching order, and are largely able to complete teaching tasks on schedule. The teaching staff of these schools is also gradually expanding, and the teaching level has improved significantly.

    This newspaper reports that the six hundred and twelve institutions of higher learning newly built during the Great Leap Forward have undergone rectification and improvement under the leadership and vigorous cultivation of the Party over the past year or so, and have rapidly grown to become a new force in our country's training of high-level talents for socialist construction.

    In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, with the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and the formation of a high tide of cultural revolution, various regions broke the "mystical conception" of running schools and vigorously established institutions of higher learning. In running schools, the principle of "walking on two legs" was implemented, giving play to the enthusiasm of all parties. Relevant central departments ran schools, local provinces (autonomous regions), municipalities, and special districts ran schools, and some large-scale industrial and mining enterprises also ran schools with the help of education departments. Some of these schools were built from scratch, others were established on the basis of the original secondary specialized schools, and some were expanded by separating some departments and specialties from the old schools. These schools include comprehensive universities and specialized institutions of engineering, agriculture, medicine, teacher training, art, and sports, some of which are in cutting-edge professions. In 1959, during the continuing Great Leap Forward, in addition to some regions continuing to run a number of institutions of higher learning, various regions also rectified the newly built institutions of higher learning, and made some adjustments from the layout of the schools to the setting of specialties. By the end of 1959, there were six hundred and twelve newly built institutions of higher learning across the country, which were firmly rooted. Now, with the exception of the Tibet region, all provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and even the vast majority of special districts across the country have institutions of higher learning. Many provinces and autonomous regions have initially formed a relatively complete higher education network with comprehensive universities and institutions of engineering, agriculture, medicine, and teacher training.

    Over the past year or so, these newly built institutions of higher learning have started from scratch, practiced diligence and frugality in running schools, and built schools while starting classes, and have generally taken shape. The basic construction of school buildings, laboratories, data rooms, and labor internship factories in the fifteen newly built institutions of higher learning in Tianjin has been rapidly increasing. The two departments of Tianjin Institute of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering have established seven laboratories and a well-equipped electrical and mechanical plant. The faculty, staff, and students of Beijing Institute of Light Industry, relying on their own hands and combining teaching, have used indigenous methods, starting with local methods and then adopting foreign methods, and have successively built five factories and thirteen laboratories, including a chemistry laboratory that can conduct forty experiments. In areas with relatively poor conditions, the newly built schools are also growing rapidly by leaps and bounds. Guizhou Institute of Technology was empty when it was built in 1958; over the past year or so, the teachers and students have participated in building the school, and have now built more than 15,000 square meters of school buildings on the ground, with seven departments and fifteen majors, including geology and metallurgy, and a series of specialized factories have been built, with more than 1,500 students.

    The establishment, consolidation, and growth of the newly built institutions of higher learning have been carried out under the leadership of the Party from beginning to end. Over the past year or so, Party organizations in various regions have given tremendous help to the newly built institutions in terms of material resources, financial resources, and other aspects, not only from the current need to solve the problems of school buildings, equipment, etc. for starting classes, but also from a long-term perspective to help schools carry out basic construction. In terms of manpower, Party organizations in various regions have transferred a large number of key personnel to strengthen the leadership of the newly built institutions. Shaanxi and Jilin provinces have successively transferred eighty-six cadres to serve as Party committee secretaries and presidents in the newly built institutions over the past year, and some prefectural committee secretaries and provincial committee officials in Guangdong, Jiangxi, and other provinces have also served concurrently as presidents of the newly built institutions of higher learning. Under the care of the Party, the newly built institutions of higher learning in various regions have generally established Party committees and assigned full-time secretaries; some regions have also established a system of school (institute) affairs committees under the leadership of the Party committee to strengthen the Party's leadership over teaching work. At present, the cadre team of each institution has initially taken shape, and Party, League, administrative, and teaching organizations have been gradually established and improved. Party committees in various regions have also vigorously organized various aspects of collaboration. Over the past year or so, regions with better conditions and many old schools with better conditions have supported the newly built schools in terms of materials, equipment, and books. Many scientific institutions, factories, and mining enterprises have also promoted the spirit of communist cooperation and provided assistance to the newly built institutions in terms of books, materials, equipment, and manpower. The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region originally did not have an institution of higher learning. Since 1958, with the support of fraternal schools and scientific departments in Beijing, Shanghai, and many other regions in terms of manpower and material resources, three institutions of higher learning have been established, which have gradually been consolidated and developed and grown.

    The most important issue for the newly built institutions of higher learning is the issue of teachers, which has also been gradually resolved smoothly over the past year or so. Party organizations in various regions have vigorously sought ways to equip the newly built institutions of higher learning with teachers, generally ensuring that classes can be started as soon as school starts. Now, a team of teachers in the newly built institutions of higher learning is also gradually expanding. The teachers in the forty-four newly built institutions in Jiangxi Province and Shenyang City alone have reached more than 2,900, and many places are continuing to transfer teachers to the newly built schools. At the same time, various regions have also taken many effective measures to train and improve the teachers in the newly built schools. These measures are generally: organizing older teachers in the school to lead young teachers and providing guidance in preparing lessons and teaching; linking new schools with old schools, with old schools leading new schools; using vacations to hold lectures and short-term training courses for teachers in the newly built institutions; the newly built institutions planning to send teachers to old schools to study and to send teachers to other places for longer periods of further study. Through these methods, the teaching level of teachers in the newly built institutions has been significantly improved. The number of teachers who can teach at Beijing Institute of Light Industry has increased from more than forty when it was first established in early 1958 to more than one hundred, and all the courses to be offered by the nineteen newly built institutions in Beijing have been offered.

    These newly built institutions of higher learning were all born in the great revolution in education, and have better arranged teaching, productive labor, and scientific research in implementing the Party's education policy. The schools have generally formulated education plans, established a set of systems related to teaching, established teaching order, and are largely able to complete teaching tasks on schedule, and the results have also gradually improved. In the first semester of Shenyang Metallurgical College, students who scored four or five points in the exam accounted for 65% of the total, and in the second semester, it increased to 74.8%. In the seven courses of a first-year class in the mechanical manufacturing major of Heilongjiang Institute of Technology, the percentage of excellent and good grades in the first semester of 1959 was 68%, and the percentage of failures was only 1.5%. Teachers and students have achieved great results in combining teaching with productive labor and carrying out scientific research activities.

    大跃进开辟了培养建设人材的新园地
    六百所新建院校巩固提高
    除西藏地区外，全国所有省、市、自治区以至绝大部分专区，都有了高等学校。新建的高等院校白手起家，勤俭办学，一般都初具规模，并建立起党委会，配备了专职书记。各校一般都建立起教学制度，确立了教学秩序，大体上都能按期完成教学任务。这些学校的教师队伍也在逐步扩大，教学水平已有显著提高。
    本报讯　在大跃进中新建的六百一十二所高等学校，一年多来在党的领导和大力培育下进行整顿和提高，已经迅速地成长起来，成为我国培养社会主义建设高级人材的一支新军。
    在大跃进的1958年，随着工农业生产事业的飞速发展和文化革命高潮的形成，各地打破办学的“神秘观念”，大办高等学校。办学中实行两条腿走路，发挥各方面积极性，中央有关部门办，地方省（自治区）、市、专区办，有些大型厂矿企业在教育部门帮助下也办。这些学校有些是白手起家、平地建成的，有的是在原来中等专业学校基础上“戴帽子”办起来的，有的是把一些老学校的系科专业分出来扩建起来的。这些学校包括综合大学以及工、农、医、师范、艺术、体育等专业性的院校，有的是尖端专业。在继续大跃进的1959年中，除了部分地区继续举办了一批高等学校外，各地都对新建的高等学校进行了整顿，从学校布局到专业设置都作了一些调整。到1959年底，全国有新建高等学校六百一十二所，巩固地扎下了深根。现在，全国除西藏地区以外，所有省、市、自治区以至绝大部分专区，都有了高等学校。许多省、自治区初步形成了一个拥有综合大学以及工、农、医、师范院校比较完整的高等教育网。
    这些新建高等学校，一年多来白手起家，勤俭办学，边开课边建校，一般都已初具规模。天津市十五所新建高等院校的校舍、实验室、资料室、劳动实习工厂等基本建设，在迅速增长，天津机电学院两个系即已建立了七个实验室和一座设备完善的机电厂。北京轻工业学院的师生员工，赤手空拳，结合教学，用土法上马，先土后洋，已先后建起五个工厂十三个实验室，其中化学实验室能开出四十个实验。条件比较差的地区，新建学校也在一日千里地快速成长。贵州工学院1958年建校时空无所有；一年多来经师生动手参加建校，现已平地建起一万五千多平方米的校舍，设有地质、冶金等七个系和十五个专业，建成一系列专业工厂，学生有一千五百多人。
    新建高等学校从建立到巩固成长，自始至终是在党的领导下进行的。一年多来各地党组织，对新建院校从物力、财力等各方面，给予巨大的帮助，既从当前需要解决开学上课的校舍、设备等问题，也从长远着眼帮助学校进行基本建设。人力上，各地党组织都抽调大批骨干，加强对新建院校的领导。陕西、吉林两省一年来已先后调配了八十六名干部去新建院校担任党委书记和院校长，广东、江西等省并有一些地委书记、省委负责人兼任新建高等学校院校长。在党的关怀下，各地新建高等学校一般已建立起党委会，配备了专职书记；有些地区的新建高等学校还建立了在党委领导下的校（院）务委员会负责制度，加强党对教学工作的领导。目前各院校干部队伍已初步形成，党、团、行政和教学组织已逐步建立和健全起来。各地党委还大力组织各方面协作，一年多来条件较好的地区和许多条件较好的老学校，都在物资设备、图书等方面支援了新建学校。许多科学机关、厂矿企业也发扬共产主义协作精神，在图书资料、设备、人力等方面，给新建院校以援助。宁夏回族自治区原来没有一所高等学校，1958年以来在北京、上海等许多地区兄弟学校和科学部门人力物力的支援下，办起三所高等学校，现已逐步巩固发展、成长起来。
    新建高等学校最重要的一个问题即师资问题，一年多来也在逐步顺利解决。各地党组织大力设法为新建高等学校配备师资，一般做到开学即能上课。现在新建高等学校的一支教师队伍也在逐步扩大，仅江西省和沈阳市四十四所新建院校的教师，即已达二千九百多人，许多地方还在继续调配教师到新建学校。与此同时，各地还采取许多有效办法，培养提高新建学校的师资，这些办法一般是：组织学校内老年教师带青年教师，在备课、教学当中进行辅导；新学校和老学校挂钩，由老学校带新学校；利用假期为新建院校的教师开办讲座、短期训练班；新建院校有计划地派教师到老校学习，派教师到外地作较长时期的进修等。通过这些办法，新建院校教师的教学水平已有显著提高。北京轻工业学院能开课的教师，已由1958年初成立时四十多人增至一百多人，北京全市十九所新建院校要开的课都开出来了。
    这些新建高等学校都是在教育大革命中诞生的，在贯彻执行党的教育方针中都较好地安排了教学、生产劳动和科学研究。各校一般已制订了教育计划，建立起有关教学的一套制度，确立了教学秩序，大体上都能按期完成教学任务，成绩也逐步提高。沈阳冶金专科学校在第一学期，全校学生考试成绩四、五分的占65％，第二学期即增加到74．8％。黑龙江工学院机械制造专业一年级一个班的七门课程，1959年上学期成绩优秀和良好的占68％，不及格的只有1．5％。师生们结合教学进行生产劳动，开展科学研究活动，都取得了很大成绩。
