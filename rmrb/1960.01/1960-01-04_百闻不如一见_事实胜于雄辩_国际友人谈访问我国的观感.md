Editor's Note: In 1959, many foreign friends visited our country and witnessed firsthand the tremendous efforts made by our people to change their backward state. Here are some of their impressions. Readers can clearly see from this that their evaluation of China's Great Leap Forward and people's communes is objective and fair.

The Chinese People Love Labor, Yearn for Peace, and Are Building the Country with a Happy Mood

Fernando Manrique (Peruvian Congressman) made a written statement to a reporter from the Peruvian "Public Opinion Daily" at the end of September last year:

The brilliant achievements of China's social reforms are indeed an undeniable fact. We realized that whether in terms of humanity or the vigorous progress of social reforms, it gave us an unforgettable and valuable experience!

The Chinese people are working hard to develop their industry, and "more, faster, better, and more economically" is their goal. They are striving to go upstream and seek happiness for the masses.

The great Chinese people's love for labor and their sincere desire for peace are indeed infinitely moving to us.

Bayol (Senator of the Argentine Intransigent Radical Civic Union) said at a press conference in Buenos Aires on November 25 last year:

The Chinese people are full of energy and are rapidly developing their economy: steel, coal, and oil.

There are no thieves and prostitutes in China. The Chinese are disciplined, love the land, care for their children, and respect the elderly. No one in China talks about war; on the contrary, the most talked about topic is peace.

The Chinese revolution now feeds all the people, whereas in the past, hundreds of thousands of people died of starvation every year.

Evaristo Romero (Paraguayan poet) told Xinhua News Agency reporters in October last year:

No capitalist country can build its own country as happily, with free power and a happy mood as the Chinese people.

I saw the tremendous changes in China's rural areas and the simultaneous development of industry and education. I saw with my own eyes the people of the commune working with extreme enthusiasm. The people's commune movement is one of the sources of China's achievements in recent years. This achievement makes a great contribution to world peace.

Ahmed Mohammed Yehia (Iraqi Minister of the Interior) told a reporter from "People's Solidarity Daily" in Baghdad in October last year:

China is a peace-loving country.

The Chinese people's efforts to build a better future for their country are linked to the work of striving for peace, and they stand with the people who are fighting against imperialism. The Chinese people have always hoped to have good relations with all countries, large and small, and they are ready to defend peace if necessary. In my opinion, China does not want to control or interfere in the internal affairs of any country.

The Chinese people are very concerned about our just cause and our struggle against U.S. imperialism and to defend our republic and the achievements of the July 14 revolution.

Romesh Chandra (Secretary-General of the All-India Peace Council) published an article in the Indian "New Age" weekly on October 25 last year:

The Chinese people's love for peace and friendship with all countries in the world are important contents of the National Day parade. No matter which country the foreign guests are from, they will encounter friendly smiles from men, women, old and young, which proves that peace and friendship have penetrated into the hearts of the people.

Indian friends living in China told me that recently everyone they encountered showed them even greater enthusiasm than before, and these people expressed to them with confidence that they believed our friendship would grow even more, and that the current differences would soon be resolved through negotiation.

Wu Jue Min (Chairman of the Burma Railway Workers Union) told a reporter from the Yangon "China Daily" on June 4 last year about his impressions of visiting China:

The Chinese people are hardworking.

The construction projects are amazing, such as the Ming Tombs Reservoir and the Yangtze River Bridge, which are rare in the world. I believe that China's industrial construction will soon catch up with various advanced industrial countries.

From the festive parade, you can see the situation of the workers in New China. They are working actively and with great enthusiasm. They raised charts of their work achievements, and no one was unmoved.

Albert Sollier (Representative of the French General Confederation of Labor to China) published an article in the French "Marseillaise" on November 13 last year:

When visiting factories and people's communes, Chinese comrades told us: "Due to attending night school, the number of illiterates has been reduced to only 12%, 15%, or 18%." What moved us even more was that the Chinese people, including the elderly, urgently demanded to learn.

We can cite many production figures and talk about the construction of huge dams and water conservancy projects. No Chinese government in the past could do these things.

The Chinese people urgently hope for a peaceful life.

Once the vitality of the Chinese people is liberated, it becomes a great force for construction

Mahdawi (President of the Supreme Special Military Tribunal of Iraq) told Xinhua News Agency reporters in October last year:

The most important thing that caught my attention in this emerging modern country is that the sons of this country are eagerly, actively, firmly, powerfully, and with strong determination dedicated to their work. There is an Arab saying, "Determination can move mountains," but they also add: "and can fill the sea."

Buildings such as the Great Hall of the People and the Agricultural Exhibition Hall prove the vitality of the Chinese people. This vitality was liberated after China was liberated from imperialism and reactionaries. Once this vitality is liberated, it becomes a great force for construction in all aspects of life.

De Velasco (Vice-Chairman and Congressman of the Brazilian Socialist Party) told Xinhua News Agency reporters in October last year:

It is a fact that China's industrial and agricultural output has increased, and the Chinese people are eating better and living better. China's steel production has risen from more than five million tons in 1957 to 12 million tons this year. If it can be called a "retreat," then I would like my country to have such a "retreat," and I think Britain and the United States would also like to have such a "retreat."

Martin Wickramasinghe (Chairman of the Ceylon Writers Association) told Xinhua News Agency reporters in early October last year:

In 1949, you only had light industry. In the past ten years, you have developed heavy industry and manufactured your own cars and airplanes. This achievement is something we Orientals can be proud of.

I saw a large area of ​​new buildings like palaces, which were built in less than a year, which is indeed amazing. These buildings are very beautiful from an artistic point of view, and each one is a combination of Chinese traditional and modern architecture.

The Chinese Communist Party does not interfere in people's religious activities, although it does not encourage religious worldviews.

José Antonio León Rey (Senator of the Colombian Conservative Party) said to students at Columbia University on October 19 last year when reporting on his visit to China:

The Chinese people have driven away the oppressors who have been riding on them for generations. Their progress in material and spiritual terms is tremendous.

There is no prostitution, vagrancy, begging, or other bad habits in China, but the whole country is engaged in creative labor with one heart and one mind. There is real freedom in socialist countries. It is nonsense to say that people in People's China are persecuted for their religious beliefs.

Luis León (Congressman of the Argentine People's Radical Civic Union) told reporters in Buenos Aires on November 11 last year:

We should admit a true fact: that is, the great leap forward that China has achieved in developing production and improving the people's material living standards. China's industry—whether light or heavy—and the Chinese people's belief in the future are admirable. The Chinese people know that their future depends on their own efforts.

Abdullah Abbas (Owner and Editor-in-Chief of the Iraqi "National News") published an article in "National News" on November 2 last year:

The achievements made by the Chinese people in the past ten years are worth paying great attention to and receiving extremely high praise. This is the impression of many people who have visited China at various times and represent various ideologies. Everything in China is constantly changing and progressing, and so is the lives of the Chinese people.

Norman Endicott (Toronto lawyer, Canada) said at the Toronto celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 4 last year:

During China's long struggle from 1905 to 1949, the general saying was "there is no way out." All of this is now over.

Today China is a world power, not the weak and inferior country that some people still like to see it as.

Anyone who lived in China twenty-five years ago finds it almost unbelievable to see the Chinese people now. There are no more beggars, and no one is starving or ragged.

Absil (Belgian composer) issued a press release from the Belgian cultural delegation to China at a press conference in Brussels on October 20 last year:

In every place visited by the Belgian delegation, such as people's communes, steel plants, universities, etc., the slogan of the "Great Leap Forward" was deeply convincing. The achievements made in every place we visited are amazing. Extraordinary progress has been made in all aspects.

Mrs. Tegen (leader of the Swedish women's movement) wrote in an article published in the Swedish magazine "Our Women" in June last year:

We believe what we see and what we hear. The enthusiasm of a forward-moving nation that we encountered is something we cannot doubt.

The Chinese people are currently in perhaps the happiest era—they are closely united around a long-term vision.

The Chinese people today are the masters of their own homes.

Wolf Schenke (Chairman of the German-Chinese Association of West Germany) wrote in an article published in the West German weekly "New Politics" in October last year:

When the Chinese people celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with pride in their achievements, people in the West loved to mock them. This attitude is indescribably short-sighted compared to the facts.

Historians will regard October 1, 1949 as the beginning of a new world era in fifty years. October 1, 1949 was the day of the victory of the revolution in the most populous country in the world.

Billard (Secretary General of the Belgian Metalworkers Union) published his impressions of visiting China in the Belgian General Confederation of Labor's newspaper "Trade Union News" on September 5 last year:

We can say with certainty that a great social revolution has taken place in People's China in the ten years since 1949. The Chinese people have been liberated from poverty and the darkest spiritual enslavement.

Our country can benefit a lot from China, not only material benefits, but also other aspects.

The Establishment of People's Communes in China is of Great Significance – This is a Fundamental Revolutionary Action

Ben Heda (Minister of Social Welfare of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria) told reporters from the Algerian "Holy Warrior Daily" in October last year:

I cannot help but be moved by the incredibly great achievements that New China is completing in agriculture, industry, science, and culture.

The strength of People's China lies in the consolidation and continuous strengthening of its economic independence.

The establishment of people's communes in China is a fundamental revolutionary action of great significance.

The successfully carried out agricultural revolution is the basic foundation of the Chinese people's economic and social liberation.

China greatly admires and sympathizes with our people's heroic struggle for their national liberation.

Suweiyo (Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party) said at a meeting on November 13 last year that for China, the people's commune system is good. It is in line with China's conditions and the needs of comprehensive construction. I visited many people's communes and found that public canteens and nurseries are very suitable for the needs of male and female farmers.

Suweiyo said that China has achieved such great achievements because they have correct leadership. The Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao Zedong plays a decisive role in China.

Herman Quiroga Galdo (Former Speaker of the Bolivian House of Representatives and current member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee) told Xinhua News Agency reporters on November 27 last year:

I should strictly respect the truth. I saw people working tensely, happily, and admirably everywhere in China's factories and rural areas. I did not see the "forced labor" that the outside world said. The West made a big mistake by looking at the current situation in rural China with the eyes of more than ten years ago. I saw elderly men and women with no relatives living comfortably in the commune's nursing homes, and the children in the commune's nurseries and kindergartens were very healthy... I didn't see anything that was against family life.

Purna Bahadur (Chairman of the Nepal-China Friendship Association and Chairman of the Nepal Youth Federation) told Xinhua News Agency reporters in early October last year:

China's progress is amazing.

It is encouraging to see many new high-rise buildings and factories in the suburbs of Beijing and to see that China is now manufacturing heavy machinery.

At the same time, people's living standards, as far as I can see, have improved a lot. People are more energetic than before, dress better than before, and have plenty of food.

People's communes are very encouraging, and people have more opportunities for education and better living conditions.

Li Quanxin (famous Indonesian doctor) told reporters from the Indonesian "Republic Daily" in November last year:

When we got on the train in Shenzhen, the railways were flooded on both sides, but a month later, when we returned to China, there were no floods there. What we saw were green crops. This is an example of the great power of the people's communes.

Dr. Johnson (Dean of Canterbury, England) wrote in the British "Workers Daily" on December 23 last year:

I recently visited China, which is more civilized than any country in the Western world because it has eliminated hunger.

The commune symbolizes the movement that has unfolded at lightning speed throughout the country, which has eliminated fundamental worries, filled young people and even old people with new hope and new enthusiasm; and pointed out the glorious task of improving the living standards of 650 million people and enriching their lives as a common goal of the people.

Vigeier (Professor of Physics at the University of Paris, France) said at a press conference in Hong Kong on September 10 after visiting China that he felt that the establishment of the people's commune system was the best way to deal with floods and other natural disasters. He said that if these disasters are to be overcome, the whole country must make great collective efforts, and only the people's communes can mobilize so much manpower.

Mrs. Siri Lundun (Vice-Chairman of the Norwegian Democratic Women's Federation) said in an article published in the Norwegian magazine "Women at Home and Abroad" in July last year:

People's communes are the only practical and feasible form in China's current construction of a modern country. If we want to solve major problems such as building dams and irrigating arid areas, farmers must also cooperate on a large scale. People's communes provide the possibility of large-scale cooperation.

The principle of people's communes itself also shows that it has strong vitality. I have no doubt that in a very short period of time, it will show even greater effects.

China's New Achievements in Eliminating Backwardness Encourage Warriors for National Independence

Michael Imoudu (Chairman of the Nigerian Labor Congress) said in an article published in our country's "Workers Daily" on September 30 last year:

China's brilliant achievements fill us African people with strength and hope. China's example will make the warriors who are fighting for national independence more courageous, and especially encourage the Nigerian people who will be liberated from the shackles of colonialism in October next year (1960) and enter the next stage of the struggle for political and economic liberation.

Mehdi Ben Barka (Secretary of the Secretariat of the National Union of People's Forces of Morocco) told Xinhua News Agency reporters in Beijing on October 13 last year:

What makes us more confident is our friendship and unity with many Asian and African countries that share the same ideals. Our visit to China has strengthened our confidence in the future. We learned a lot about eliminating backwardness in our visits to Beijing and the Northeast, etc., and backwardness is a common phenomenon in countries that have just been liberated from imperialist rule.

Barry Diawandu (Minister of Education of the Republic of Guinea) said at Beijing Airport on October 8 last year when he left Beijing to return home:

The establishment of diplomatic relations between Guinea and China and the signing of the first cultural cooperation agreement provide an example that conforms to the Bandung spirit. Other African countries should follow this example so that we can enter a new era of establishing friendly relations between our countries.

The Republic of Guinea, a black African country that once lived under foreign rule, yearns for the fruitful experiences of the Chinese people!

Mrs. Ortega (Chairman of the Women's Committee of the Chilean People's Action Front) told Xinhua News Agency reporters on June 26 last year:

I am deeply moved by the support and love of the Chinese people for the Chilean people, which makes me deeply moved.

New Chinese women shoulder the responsibility of building the motherland. As a woman, I feel happy. I can prove that social progress and social justice have been achieved in this part of the world. This is also the wish of the Chilean people. I have gained confidence from here.

Mrs. Dubois (American peace activist) said in an article published in the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" on September 20 last year:

Today, I saw the People's Republic of China, and I want to say to my black sisters in the United States, the West Indies, and Africa that there is now something in the world that can inspire your hearts and fill you with hope: the colored people who have been oppressed, discriminated against, exploited, and despised in the past have gotten rid of the oppressors, imperialists, and slave owners. They are now creating new world records in human relations, agriculture, industry, construction, and comprehensive development.

The Chinese people are very humble about their achievements, and they point out many shortcomings. They remind me that in order to achieve their goals, they must work hard. However, ten years is such a short time! When I think of China's next ten years, my heart beats happily.

The Visit to China Deepened My Understanding of China and I Will Introduce the Real Situation to All Aspects

Kenzo Matsumura (Advisor to the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party) said in a radio speech in Tokyo on December 21 last year about his impressions of visiting China:

The main purpose of our visit to China this time was to have cordial talks with the heads of the Chinese government to eliminate various misunderstandings between Japan and China; and also to take the opportunity to inspect the great achievements of the 600 million Chinese people in building the country, so as to deepen our correct understanding of China. During my talks with Premier Zhou, I reached a consensus on the major principles of mutual respect for each other's political systems and non-aggression against each other, from which I further strengthened my confidence that I will definitely be able to improve relations between Japan and China and promote cultural and economic exchanges in the near future. We were greatly moved by what we saw with our own eyes in the Northwest and Southwest regions of China. As a politician, I am most grateful for being able to get such a good opportunity in China this time and live a life where I can learn a few things every day.

When we visited various parts of China, we saw that China's inherent cultural relics and historical heritage were well preserved and intact in museums. According to general opinion, there must be destruction after a revolution, but it is rare and most admirable in the world that China, although having undergone a revolution, has perfectly preserved ancient culture with the help of the people. Regarding China's construction situation, I once said to Premier Zhou that we really did not expect China to have such great construction in such a short period of time. The Sanmenxia Dam, built to block the Yellow River, stands on the rolling yellow river, symbolizing the posture of New China. We also saw the Chinese people actively planting trees in the mountains to clarify the Yellow River. More than 100 million trees have been successfully planted in Lanzhou, and even the top of Badaling is full of saplings. I sincerely hope that this greening campaign currently being carried out throughout China can be successful and enrich the lives of the Chinese people even more. In addition, although the industrial construction, people's communes, and youth education in the interior of China are still under construction, they have already made great leaps forward and have undergone amazing changes compared to before liberation. Among them, especially the people's communes, have only been more than a year since their birth in August last year, and their situation seems to have achieved considerable success. Five hundred million farmers can solve the problem of eating through this, and significant achievements have also been made in social welfare. After we return to China, we will have the opportunity to actively introduce the real and specific situation of China to all aspects, and strive to promote the idea that Japan and China should be friendly and friendly.

    百闻不如一见  事实胜于雄辩
    国际友人谈访问我国的观感
    编者按：1959年中，许多外国朋友访问了我国，亲眼看到了我国人民为改变落后状态所作的巨大努力，发表了他们的观感。这里选登了其中的一部分。读者从这里可以清楚地看到，他们对我国大跃进和人民公社的评价是客观的、公正的。
    中国人民热爱劳动渴望和平正以愉快的心情建设着国家
    费尔南多·曼里克（秘鲁议员）去年9月底向秘鲁“公言报”记者发表书面谈话说：
    中国社会改革的辉煌成就，确是一件不可否认的事实。我们体会到不论在人道上或社会改革的蓬勃进展上，都给予我们一种不能忘怀的宝贵经验！
    中国人民为发展其工业正在鼓足干劲，多、快、好、省是他们的目标。他们正在力争上游，共谋大众的幸福。
    伟大的中国人民对劳动的热爱，对和平的真诚渴望确是令我们无限感动的。
    巴约耳（阿根廷不妥协激进公民联盟参议员）去年11月25日在布宜诺斯艾利斯记者招待会上说：
    中国人民干劲充沛，他们正在迅速地发展自己的经济：钢铁、煤和石油。
    中国没有盗贼和娼妓。中国人守纪律，热爱土地，关心孩子，尊敬老人。在中国没有人谈论战争，相反，人们谈得最多的题目是和平。
    中国革命现在使全体人民都吃得饱，而过去每年都有成千上万的人死于饥饿。
    埃维奥·罗梅洛（巴拉圭诗人）　去年10月向新华社记者发表谈话说：
    没有任何资本主义国家能像中国人民那样愉快地、以自由的力量和愉快的心情建设着自己的国家。
    我看到中国农村的巨大变化和工业、教育事业的同时发展。我亲眼看到公社的人民在极其热情的工作着。人民公社运动是近年来中国取得的成就的根源之一。这种成就对世界和平有着巨大的贡献。
    艾哈迈德·穆罕默德·叶海亚（伊拉克内政部长）去年10月在巴格达对“人民团结报”记者说：
    中国是一个爱好和平的国家。
    中国人民为他们国家建设更美好的未来的利益是同争取和平的工作联系在一起的，他们是同进行反帝斗争的人民站在一起的。中国人民一向希望同所有国家——不论大小——有良好的关系，而且他们准备保卫和平，如果有必要这样的话。在我看来，中国并不想控制或干涉任何国家的内政。
    中国人民非常关心我们的正义的事业和我们反对美帝国主义、保卫我们共和国和7月14日革命成果的斗争。
    罗米希·钱德拉（全印和平理事会秘书长）去年10月25日在印度“新世纪”周刊发表文章说：
    中国人民对和平的热爱和对世界所有国家的友谊是国庆游行的重要内容。不论来自哪一个国家的外宾，都会遇到男女老少的友好的微笑，这证明和平和友好已经深入了人民的心中。
    住在中国的印度朋友告诉我，最近他们遇到的每个人都对他们表现出甚至比以前更大的热情，这些人都满怀信心地向他们表示，相信我们的友谊将更加成长，目前的分歧不久将通过谈判得到解决。
    吴觉敏（缅甸铁路工会联合会主席）去年6月4日向仰光“中国日报”记者发表访华观感说：
    中国人民是勤劳的。
    建设工程使人惊奇，如十三陵水库、长江大桥等工程是世界上少见的。我相信中国的工业建设不久就能赶上各个先进的工业国家。
    从节日游行可以看到新中国工人的情形，他们工作积极，热情很高。他们抬起自己工作成就的图表，没有人不受感动。
    阿尔柏·索里埃（法国总工会访华代表）去年11月13日在法国“马赛人报”发表文章说：
    在参观工厂和人民公社的时候，中国同志告诉我们说：“由于上夜校，文盲人数减少到只有12％、15％或18％”更使我们感动的是，中国人民，包括上了年纪的人都迫切要求学习。
    我们可以举出许多生产上的数字、还可谈到巨大的堤坝建设、水利建设。过去没有一个中国政府能够做到这些。
    中国人民迫切希望和平的生活。
    中国人民的活力一经解放就变成了建设的伟大力量
    马赫达维（伊拉克最高特别军事法庭庭长）去年10月对新华社记者发表谈话说：
    这个新兴的现代国家引起我注意的最重要的事情是，这个国家的儿子热切地、积极地、坚定地、有力地和以坚强的决心献身于他们的工作。阿拉伯成语说，“决心可以移山”，但是他们还加上一句：“可以填海”。
    像人民大会堂、农业展览馆等建筑物，证明了中国人民的活力。这种活力是中国从帝国主义和反动派下面获得解放以后解放出来的。这种活力一经解放，就变成在生活各方面进行建设的伟大力量。
    德·维拉斯科（巴西社会党副主席、众议员）去年10月向新华社记者发表谈话说：
    中国的工农业产量增加了，中国人民吃得更好、住得更好了，这一切都是事实。中国钢产量从1957年的五百多万吨上升到今年的一千二百万吨，如果可以称作“跃退”的话，那我愿意我国也有这样的“跃退”，我想英、美也都希望有这样的“跃退”的。
    马丁·魏克拉马沁（锡兰作家协会主席）　去年10月初对新华社记者发表谈话说：
    1949年，你们还只有轻工业。十年来，你们发展了重工业、制造出自己的轿车和飞机，这一成就是我们东方人可以引以为骄傲的。
    我看到了一大片像宫殿样的新建筑，它们是在不到一年的时间里建成的，这确实是惊人的。这些建筑从艺术上来看很美，每一座都是中国传统和现代建筑的结合。
    中国共产党并不干涉人民的宗教活动，虽然它并不鼓励宗教人生观。
    何塞·安东尼奥·莱昂·雷伊（哥伦比亚保守党参议员）去年10月19日在哥伦比亚大学向学生作访华报告时说：
    中国人民已经赶走了世世代代骑在他们身上的压迫者。他们在物质上和精神上的进步是巨大的。
    中国没有卖淫流浪、求乞和其他恶习，而是举国一致地在进行创造性劳动。在社会主义国家有真正的自由，说人民中国有人由于宗教信仰而受到迫害是胡说八道。
    路易斯·莱昂（阿根廷人民激进公民联盟众议员）去年11月11日在布宜诺斯艾利斯向记者发表谈话说：
    我们应该承认一个千真万确的事实：那就是中国在发展生产和改善人民物质生活水平方面所获得的巨大跃进。中国工业——无论是轻工业还是重工业的发展和中国人民对未来的信念是令人敬佩的，中国人民知道他们的未来取决于他们自己的努力。
    阿卜杜拉·阿巴斯（伊拉克“国民报”所有人和主编）去年11月2日在“国民报”上发表文章说：
    中国人民在过去十年中所取得的成就值得非常重视和得到极高的称赞。这是许多曾经在各个不同的时候访问过中国以及代表着各种不同的意识形态的人们的印象。中国的每一件事物都在不断地变化和进步，中国人民的生活也是如此。
    诺尔曼·恩地科特（加拿大多伦多律师）　去年10月4日在多伦多庆祝中国建国十周年大会上说：
    中国在1905年到1949年的长期斗争中，一般普遍的说法是“没有出路”。现在这一切都过去了。
    今天中国是世界大国，而不是某些人仍然喜欢把它看作的那样一个孱弱和劣等的国家。
    凡是在二十五年以前在中国住过的人，看到现在的中国人民几乎是难以置信的。那里不再有乞丐，没有一个人挨饿或衣衫褴褛。
    阿布西尔（比利时作曲家）去年10月20日在布鲁塞尔的记者招待会上发表比利时文化代表团的访华新闻公报说：
    在比利时代表团访问的每一个地方，如人民公社，钢铁厂，高等学校等等，到处都深深令人信服地说明了“大跃进”的口号。我们参观的每一个地方所取得的成就是惊人的。各方面都取得了异乎寻常的进展。
    泰根夫人（瑞典妇女运动领袖）去年6月在瑞典“我们妇女”杂志上发表的一篇文章写道：
    我们相信我们所看到的以及我们所听到的。我们所遇到的一个勇往直前的民族热情是我们不能怀疑的。
    中国人民目前正处在或许是最幸福的时代——他们紧密地团结在一个远景规划的周围。
    今天的中国人是自己家里的主人。
    沃尔夫·沈克（西德德中协会会长）去年10月在西德“新政治”周刊发表文章写道：
    当中国人充满了对已取得的成就的自豪来庆祝建国十周年的时候，在西方人们却专爱嘲讽。这种态度与事实相比简直是无法形容的近视。
    历史家将在五十年后把1949年10月1日作为一个新的世界时代开始的日子。1949年10月1日是世界上人口最多的国家革命胜利的日子。
    比拉丹（比利时五金工会总书记）去年9月5日在比利时总工会机关报“工会报”上发表访华观感说：
    我们可以肯定地说，人民中国从1949年以来的十年中发生了伟大的社会革命。中国人民从贫困和最黑暗的精神奴役中解放了出来。
    我们国家能够从中国得到很多好处，不仅是物质利益，也包括其他方面的利益。
    中国成立人民公社意义极大  这是一个根本性的革命行动
    本·赫达（阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府社会福利部长）去年10月对阿尔及利亚“圣战者报”记者说：
    我不能不为新中国在农业、工业、科学和文化方面正在完成的大得不可思议的成就所感动。
    人民中国的强大就在于它经济独立的巩固和不断加强。
    中国成立人民公社是一个意义极大的根本性的革命行动。
    成功地进行了的农业革命，是中国人民经济和社会解放的基本基础。
    中国对于我国人民为了自己的民族解放而进行的英勇斗争十分钦佩和同情。
    苏维约（印度尼西亚国民党总主席）去年11月13日在一次会上说，对中国来说，人民公社制是好的，它符合中国的条件和全面建设的需要。我参观了许多人民公社，并且发现，公共食堂和托儿所十分符合男女农民的需要。
    苏维约说，中国所以取得这样伟大的成就，是因为他们有正确的领导，毛泽东主席所领导的中国共产党在中国起着决定性的作用。
    赫尔曼·基罗加·加尔多（玻利维亚前众议院议长、现任众议院外交委员会委员）去年11月27日向新华社记者发表谈话说：
    我应该严格地尊重真理。我在中国的工厂和农村到处看到人们紧张愉快地、令人钦佩地劳动着。我没有看到外界所说的“强迫劳动”。西方以十多年前的眼光来看待当前中国农村的情况是犯了一个大错。我看到没有亲属的老年男人和妇女在公社敬老院里生活得很舒适，公社托儿所、幼儿园的孩子都很健康……我没有看到什么反家庭生活的地方。
    普尔纳·巴哈杜尔（尼中友协主席、尼泊尔青年联盟主席）去年10月初对新华社记者发表谈话说：
    中国的进步使人惊讶。
    看到北京郊区许多新的高大的建筑和工厂，看到中国现在已经制造重型机械，很令人鼓舞。
    与此同时，人民生活水平，就我所见已提高了不少。人们比以前更加生气勃勃，穿得也比以前漂亮，食物充足。
    人民公社是很令人鼓舞的，人们有了更多受教育的机会，和更好的生活条件。
    李全信（印度尼西亚著名医生）去年11月对印度尼西亚“共和国报”记者说：
    当我们在深圳上火车时，铁路两旁被洪水淹没，但是一个月以后，在我们回国时，那里已经没有洪水了。我们看到的是碧绿的庄稼。这是表明人民公社巨大力量的一个例子。
    约翰逊博士（英国坎特伯雷教长）去年12月23日在英国“工人日报”上写道：
    我最近访问过中国，它比西方世界的任何国家都要文明，因为它已经消灭了饥饿。
    公社象征着以闪电般的速度在全国各地展开的那个运动，这个运动已经消除了根本的忧虑，使得青年人甚至是老年人充满新的希望和新的热情；并且指出了提高六亿五千万人民的生活水准和丰富他们的生活的光荣任务作为人民共同的目标。
    维基埃（法国巴黎大学物理学教授）在访问中国后于9月10日到达香港时在记者招待会上说，他感到人民公社制度的建立是对付水灾和其他自然灾害的最好的办法。他说，如果要战胜这些灾害，全国就必须作出巨大的集体努力，只有人民公社才有可能动员那么多的人力。
    西丽·隆敦夫人（挪威民主妇联副主席）去年7月在挪威“国内外妇女”杂志上发表的一篇文章中说：
    人民公社是中国当前在建设一个现代化国家中唯一的、切实可行的形式。如果想要解决像建筑水坝、灌溉干旱地区这样重大问题，农民之间也就必须进行大规模的合作。人民公社给予了大规模的合作的可能性。
    人民公社原则本身也显示了它具有强大生命力。我不怀疑在很短时期内，它将会显示出更大的效果。
    中国消除落后状态的新成就鼓舞了争取民族独立的战士
    迈克尔·伊穆杜（尼日利亚工会大会主席）　去年9月30日在我国“工人日报”上发表文章中说：
    中国的光辉成就使我们非洲人民充满了力量和希望。中国的榜样将使正在进行民族独立的战士更加勇敢，特别鼓舞了明年（1960年）10月将从殖民主义枷锁下解放出来并进入争取政治、经济解放斗争的下一阶段的尼日利亚人民。
    迈赫迪·本·巴尔卡（摩洛哥人民力量全国联盟总书记处书记）去年10月13日在北京对新华社记者发表谈话说：
    使我们更有信心的是我们跟许多具有同样理想的亚洲和非洲国家的友谊和团结。我们在中国的访问更加强了我们对未来的信心。我们在北京和东北等地的访问中学到了许多关于消除落后状态的宝贵经验，而落后状态是刚刚从帝国主义统治下获得解放的国家共有的现象。
      巴里·迪亚万杜（几内亚共和国教育部长）去年10月8日离京回国时在北京机场发表告别讲话中说：
    几中两国建立外交关系和签订第一个文化合作协定，提供了符合万隆精神的榜样，非洲其他国家应该效法这种榜样，以便我们彼此能够进入我们各国间建立友好关系的新纪元。
    曾经生活在外国统治下的黑非洲国家几内亚共和国，多么向往中国人民所取得的有成效的经验！
    奥特加夫人（智利人民行动阵线妇女委员会主席）去年6月26日对新华社记者发表谈话说：
    我深深感到中国人民对智利人民的支援和热爱，这使我深受感动。
    新中国妇女承担着建设祖国的责任。做为一个妇女，我感到幸福。我可以证明，社会的进步和社会的正义在世界的这个地方实现了。这一点也是智利人民的心愿。我从这里得到了信心。
    杜波伊斯夫人（美国和平人士）去年9月20日在香港“大公报”上发表的一篇文章中说：
    今天，我看见了中华人民共和国，我要对在全美国、在西印度、在非洲的黑人姊妹说，现在世界上有一种能激发你的心、能使你充满希望的新东西：过去曾经受过压迫、被歧视、被剥削、被贱视的有色人民已经摆脱了压迫者、帝国主义和奴隶主。他们现在在人类关系上，在农业、在工业、在建设、在全面的发展上都创造了世界的新纪录。
    中国人民对他们的成就非常谦虚，他们指出许多不够的地方。他们提醒我，为了要达到他们的目标，他们必须苦干。然而，十年是这样短短的时间！当我想到中国今后的十年，我的心愉快地跳动。
    访华之行加深了对中国的认识将要把真实情况介绍给各方面
    松村谦三（日本自由民主党顾问）去年12月21日在东京发表广播演说谈访华观感时说：
    我们这次在中国访问的主要目的在于和中国政府首脑亲切交谈以解除日中之间的各种误会；同时也顺便考察中国六亿人民建设国家的伟大成就，借以加深我们对中国的正确认识。我同周总理举行会谈时，就日中两国互相尊重对方国家的政治制度和互不侵犯对方国家的大原则取得了一致意见，从这一点上，我又加深了在不久的将来一定能改善日中两国关系和互相促进文化经济交流的信心。我们在西北和西南各地亲眼看到了中国人民热心从事建设的情形，受到了极大的感动。作为一个政治家，我这次能够在中国得到这样好的机会，过着天天能学习几样东西的日子，这是我最感谢的。
    我们到中国各地访问，看到中国固有的文物和历史遗产在博物馆里保存得很好，又很完整。按一般的说法，革命之后必有破坏，不过像中国这样，虽然经过了革命，但由于人民的协助，完善地保存着古代文化，这是世界上罕有的情形，而又是令人最钦佩的。关于中国的建设情况，我曾对周总理说过，我们确实没有想到中国在极短的时间内会有这样伟大的建设。为拦住黄河大水而建设的三门峡水坝耸立在滚滚的黄色河水上，正象征着新中国的姿态。我们又看到中国人民在山区为澄清黄河之水而正在积极植树。在兰州已经种植成功超过一亿棵的树木，连八达岭的山顶也种满了树苗。我曾衷心希望目前在中国各地普遍展开的这项绿化运动能够成功，并使中国人民的生活更加丰富起来。此外，中国内地的工业建设、人民公社和青少年的教育等虽然还在建设中，但已经有了很大的跃进，比起解放以前有了惊人的变化。其中特别是人民公社，从去年8月诞生以来虽然才过了一年多，而它们的情形看来似乎已经获得了相当的成功。使五亿农民借此可以解决吃的问题，在社会福利方面也算取得了显著的成就。我们回国以后能有机会把中国的真实具体情况积极介绍给各方面，并在努力推广日中两国应该亲善友好的想法。
