The rapeseed cultivation area this year is larger than in previous years. Management is solid and meticulous, and pest and disease prevention and control are grasped early and tightly. Generally, growth is good. The "Rapeseed Kings" planted by utilizing field edges, corners, and around houses are also robust. In Yilong County, Sichuan alone, there are 5.3 million "Rapeseed King" plants that have already matured. However, in some areas, due to incomplete aphid control, viral diseases are still spreading. In some areas, the cultivation area of "Victory Rapeseed" has been reduced this year, and the area of "Local Rapeseed" has been expanded, reducing disease resistance. Although Victory Rapeseed can resist viral diseases, it cannot resist Sclerotinia disease. Currently, Sclerotinia disease has begun to appear, and vigilance must be increased. Various regions have created many successful experiences in preventing and controlling rapeseed diseases, which are introduced as follows:

Methods for Preventing Viral Diseases

	I. Wood Ash Water: Add 20 catties of wood ash to 100 catties of boiling water, stir thoroughly, soak for 2 hours, filter out the ash residue, add 4 taels of cooked vegetable oil to the filtrate, and disperse the oil flowers floating on the surface of the water. Spraying this can turn the wrinkled, yellowish-green mottled diseased leaves green, and the leaves will unfold.
	II. Xilisheng and Lime Water: Mix 1 catty of Xilisheng and 2 catties of hydrated lime evenly, add 200 catties of water, and spray. The effect is very good.
	III. Xilisheng and Lime Powder: Mix 1 part of Xilisheng and 10 parts of hydrated lime evenly and sprinkle. Use 7 catties per mu. Continuous prevention and control can inhibit and alleviate viral diseases.
	IV. Yinyang Ash: Mix 30 catties of grass ash and 10 catties of hydrated lime evenly and sprinkle on the leaves to treat diseases, fertilize, and prevent frost.
	V. White Alkali Water: Dissolve 1 catty of white alkali (crude sodium carbonate) in 50 catties of water (add more water when the temperature is high) and spray. Many areas in Sichuan use this method for prevention and control.
	VI. Impatiens Glandulifera Water: Use 1 catty of flowers and 10 catties of water, soak for one or two days and nights, filter out the original solution, and spray.
	VII. Lime Sulfur Mixture: Spray with a Lime Sulfur Mixture of 0.3 to 0.5 degrees Baumé, which can also control Sclerotinia disease.

Methods for Preventing Sclerotinia Disease

	I. Scraping Treatment: After the base of the rapeseed stalk becomes diseased, scrape off the diseased part and apply Lime Sulfur Mixture or a 1:2 mixture of Ceresan and hydrated lime powder. After a few days, the diseased area will heal. This method was created in Xindu County, Sichuan, and has been promoted and used.
	II. Grass Ash and Lime Powder: Mix 2 parts of grass ash and 1 part of hydrated lime evenly. Sprinkle around the roots of the rapeseed, but do not get too close to the roots. Use 60 catties per mu.
	III. Sulfur and Lime Powder: Mix 1 part of sulfur and 8 parts of hydrated lime evenly and sprinkle on the middle and lower parts of the plant. Use 10 catties per mu.
	IV. Ferrous Sulfate and Jewelweed Mixture: Mash 10 to 20 catties of jewelweed, add 100 catties of water, soak for two or three days, filter, take 100 catties of the filtrate, dissolve 1 catty of ferrous sulfate, and use it to irrigate the base of the plant. Use 300 catties per mu.
	V. Ceresan and Lime Powder: Mix 1 part of Ceresan and 15 parts of hydrated lime evenly and sprinkle on the middle and lower parts of the plant. Use 7 to 8 catties per mu.
	VI. Garlic Solution: Mash 5 to 10 catties of garlic, add 100 catties of water, stir, take the clarified liquid, and spray or irrigate the base of the plant.

Various localities have also proven that resolutely implementing the Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture, such as rational irrigation and drainage, rational fertilization, etc., and strengthening field management, such as cultivating and weeding, loosening the soil (which also has the effect of cutting off hyphae for Sclerotinia disease), cleaning the field, removing yellow and diseased leaves, promoting ventilation and light transmission, and preventing lodging, etc., to make the plants strong and increase disease resistance, can also greatly reduce and eliminate the causes of disease.

    油菜病毒病和菌核病的防治
    今年的油菜栽培面积比往年大，管理扎实细致，防治病虫抓得早、抓得紧，一般生长良好；利用田边地角、屋前屋后种植的“油菜王”，也都健壮，仅四川仪陇一县已成王的油菜就有五百三十万窝。但部分地区，由于治蚜不够彻底，病毒病仍在蔓延；有的地区今年缩小了“胜利油菜”的栽培面积，“土种油菜”面积扩大了，抗病能力减低。胜利油菜虽能抗病毒病，却不能抗菌核病，目前菌核病已经露头，必须提高警惕。各地在防治油菜病害中创造了不少的成功经验，现介绍如下：
    防治病毒病的方法
    一、油灰水　用一百斤沸水，加入二十斤毛灰，充分搅拌，浸二小时后，滤掉灰渣，在滤出液里掺入四两熟菜油，并把浮在水面上的油花掏散，用来喷射，能使叶片皱缩、叶色黄绿相间的病叶转绿，叶片舒展开来。
    二、西力生、石灰水　西力生一斤，熟石灰二斤，和匀，兑水二百斤，喷射，效果很好。
    三、西力生、石灰粉　西力生一份，熟石灰十份，混合均匀，用来喷撒，每亩用量七斤，连续防治，能抑制和减轻病毒病。
    四、阴阳灰　草木灰三十斤，熟石灰十斤，和匀，撒在叶面上既治病，又施肥，也防冻。
    五、白碱水　白碱（粗制碳酸钠）一斤，兑水五十斤（温度高时要多兑一些水），喷射，四川不少地区采用此法防治。
    六、打破碗花花水　花一斤，水十斤，浸一两个昼夜，滤出原液喷射。
    七、石硫合剂　用波美零点三到零点五度的石硫合剂喷射，并可兼治菌核病。
    防治菌核病的方法
    一、刮治　油菜基秆发病后，刮除病患部分，用石硫合剂或一比二的赛力散熟石灰粉涂上，几天以后，病部愈合。此法系四川新都县创造，已经推广使用。
    二、草木灰、石灰粉　草木灰二份，熟石灰一份，和匀。撒在油菜根部四周，不要离根太近。每亩用量六十斤。
    三、硫黄、石灰粉　硫磺一份，熟石灰八份，和匀，撒在植株的中、下部。每亩用量十斤。
    四、硫酸亚铁、猫儿眼混合液　用十斤到二十斤猫儿眼，捣烂，兑水一百斤，浸二、三天，滤过，取滤出液一百斤，溶入硫酸亚铁一斤，用来灌窝。每亩用量三百斤。
    五、赛力散，石灰粉　赛力散一份，熟石灰十五份，和匀，喷撒在植株的中、下部。每亩用量七到八斤。
    六、大蒜液　大蒜五到十斤，捣烂，加水一百斤，搅拌后，取其澄清液喷射或灌窝。
    各地还证明坚决贯彻八字宪法，如合理排灌、合理施肥等等，以及加强田间管理，如中耕除草、疏松土壤（对菌核病还有切断菌丝的作用）。清洁田园、摘毁黄叶病叶、促使通风透光、防止倒伏等等，使植株健壮，增加抗病能力，也可大大减少与消灭发病的诱因。
