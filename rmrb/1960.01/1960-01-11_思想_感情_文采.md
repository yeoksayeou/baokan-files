Thought, Feeling, and Literary Talent
陶铸, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Guangdong Province's major newspapers and broadcasting services are developing rapidly. In addition to the *Southern Daily* and *Guangzhou Daily*, the official newspapers of the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees, the *Yangcheng Evening News* and *Guangdong Pictorial* have also been established. These publications have considerable circulation. The provincial and municipal People's Broadcasting Stations broadcast five kinds of programs daily, and new large transmitting stations have begun operation, making broadcasts audible throughout the province. Experimental television stations have also begun broadcasting. A city with daily newspapers, evening newspapers, pictorials, plus radio and television—if all are well-managed, then we will have powerful tools for propaganda and education, and the cultural life of the people will be quite rich. I am very much in favor of having an evening newspaper in a large city. An evening newspaper not only carries materials for the dissemination of current events and policies but also provides materials to increase knowledge, broaden horizons, and enhance culture to supplement the daily newspaper. People can read about sports news like ball games and chess after dinner, which is at least a form of entertainment and is much more meaningful than aimlessly wandering the streets or playing "Five Hundred." It seems that the main problem with Guangdong's news work is not the quantitative development but the improvement of quality.

To Seriously Study Party Policies, Understand Party Policies, and Firmly Propagate Party Policies

Propagating the Party's lines, principles, and policies is the basic task of the Party's newspapers and broadcasts, and thus the basic task of all journalists. There is no doubt that Party policies come from the masses, reflect the will and demands of the people, and represent the interests of the people. However, Party policies also need to go back to the masses, to be accepted and mastered by the people, to be put into action and practice, and to be transformed into actual life. This requires a process, and the Party's news organs play an important role and bear significant responsibility in this "from the masses, to the masses" process. Whether the work is done well or not directly affects the length, smoothness, health, etc., of this process. This is a principle that journalists already know. However, talking about it is one thing, and doing it is another. Putting these well-known principles into practice and checking the effects, whether good or bad, superior or inferior, will reveal that it is not easy to do. This includes fundamental issues such as the position and viewpoint of the journalists.

Why emphasize this issue now? This is related to the revolutionary development reaching a new stage. We are now building socialism at high speed and carrying out the socialist revolution thoroughly, for which we do not yet have sufficient experience. For example, I have been involved in land reform in several regions, and I have gained experience. What is "left," what is "right," what is the right way to do things, what is the wrong way, under what conditions does a certain phenomenon arise, and how should it be handled, etc., are all relatively familiar. Now, we have only had a short time to engage in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the vast number of cadres still lack experience, so it is inevitable that some deviations and difficulties will arise in the process of implementing the Party's lines, principles, and policies. Because newspapers bear the task of guiding work, the quality of the dissemination of Party policies is of great importance. Therefore, we require journalists to be more insightful than ordinary comrades doing practical work. What is especially important is that throughout the entire historical period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, because we want to thoroughly eliminate capitalism and its ideological influence, and thoroughly transform the bourgeoisie and upper-strata petty-bourgeois elements and their intellectuals, this cannot but provoke their resistance. Our goal in carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction is to ultimately eliminate classes. The bourgeois elements see this most clearly, even more clearly than many of our comrades. Therefore, based on their class instincts, they always try every possible means to resist, and their main means is to use their ideology to influence the workers and peasants, and to influence the wavering elements within our Party. Within our Party, there are often a small handful of wavering elements who become representatives of bourgeois ideology within the Party. Among the workers and peasants, there are also many old ideas and old habits, and they may accept their influence under their clamor. This phenomenon of class struggle cannot but be reflected in our news teams. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology among journalists. In this regard, journalists have already had many experiences and lessons.

What are the most important experiences and lessons? I believe that in the new historical period, in the complex, tortuous, and long-term struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, our journalists must firmly propagate the Party's policies. As mentioned earlier, Party policies come from the masses and represent the interests of the masses, but it still requires a process for Party policies to be accepted by the vast number of people. In the process of implementing Party policies, the vast number of people need to be educated because of the existence of old ideas and old habits, and their awareness needs to be raised to the level of Party policies. At the same time, the bourgeoisie and upper-strata petty-bourgeois elements are bound to resist and need to be overcome, and their ideological influence among the people needs to be swept away. Therefore, we require newspapers to firmly propagate Party policies and to wage struggles against bourgeois ideology. For the various political and ideological trends that objectively exist, it is necessary to have a clear attitude, whether to approve or oppose.

When propagating Party policies, our newspapers need to have such an attitude: if you believe it, I will also say it; if you don't believe it, I will still say it; if you curse me, I will still say it; if you shout "Long live," I will also say it. Adopting such a firm attitude to propagate Party policies can shorten the process of the masses accepting Party policies. Conversely, the result will be the opposite. Is this blind faith? I believe this is revolutionary steadfastness, not blind faith. The lines, principles, and policies formulated by our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are completely correct. They represent the interests of the vast majority of the masses, and they guide the vast number of people to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. Why should our Party newspapers not firmly propagate them? This firm attitude is a manifestation of our belief in truth, our support for truth, our dissemination of truth, and our adherence to truth. It is a manifestation of our infinite trust in the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. How can it be said to be blind faith? In the news teams, there are still many people who emphasize "independent thinking." The concept of "independent thinking," viewed abstractly, is not a problem. However, if so-called "independent thinking" is demanded on matters of principle such as the Party's lines, principles, and policies, it actually means deviating from the Party's leadership and losing political direction, and the result will be becoming a captive of bourgeois ideology.

It needs to be known that newspapers and radio have a great influence. Newspapers print hundreds of thousands of copies, and radio can be heard everywhere in the province. They are closely related to the Party's work. In 1957, the bourgeois rightists attacked the Party, and they also directed their criticism at the newspapers, saying that the newspapers "only sing praises." This proves from the negative side how significant it is for our newspapers and radio to firmly propagate the Party's lines, principles, and policies. Therefore, we have reason to require comrades engaged in news work to better study Party policies, understand Party policies, and have the greatest firmness in Party policies. We require them to be more insightful than ordinary comrades doing practical work. Although this requirement is somewhat harsh, it is not excessive. Naturally, our experience in various tasks of socialist revolution and socialist construction is not yet sufficient, and our experience in propaganda work is also not yet sufficient. Therefore, to reach this level, a great effort is needed. However, as long as we establish a firm view on several fundamental issues of socialist revolution and socialist construction, such as the issue of high-speed development of socialism, the issue of carrying the socialist revolution through to the end, and the issue of correctly treating revolutionary mass movements, and regularly and conscientiously study the Party's various policies and actual situations, and constantly accumulate political experience in actual struggles, then we will be able to sit and stand firmly in the storms, be able to distinguish between the mainstream and the tributaries, be able to distinguish between what is temporarily effective and what is always effective, and gradually be able to have a premonition of the development of objective things. And all of this boils down to the most fundamental point: completely consciously listening to the Party's words and completely consciously ensuring that newspapers and radio become the Party's sharp tools.

To Have a High Degree of Enthusiasm and Sensitivity Towards Things

The things I am talking about are socialist things, that is, new things. The socialist system itself is a new thing. Under the socialist system, new things, both large and small, emerge every moment. Now, we have the general line of fully developing people's subjective initiative under the objective law of development. We are vigorously carrying out mass movements in various production and construction tasks, and we are vigorously promoting a style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. It is truly a time of heroic figures and countless beautiful things. New things are emerging one after another. Are such things not worthy of being treated with a high degree of enthusiasm?

The birth of any new thing is bound to go through a great uproar, and its growth is bound to go through an irreconcilable struggle with the old things. Since this thing is new, it will never be perfect and flawless from the beginning. When encountered by people who have old ideas and old habits, pointing out its shortcomings can probably reveal one hundred and several tens of them. Only those who truly possess a Marxist-Leninist worldview will understand that all developing things are imperfect and that revolutionary mass movements inevitably have shortcomings or errors. And true Marxists-Leninists always take it as their duty to cherish, support, and promote the development of new things, and firmly believe that the shortcomings in the mass movements are at most only a "finger" problem. The growth of new things is always difficult and tortuous. In such complex and tortuous circumstances, we cannot but make a very high demand on the Party's newspapers and radio, and on all propaganda workers. We require them to shout loudly, to speak out loudly, for all new things as soon as they appear, when they are still in the budding stage, and to remove all obstacles in the path of their development and growth. The ideological and combative nature of a newspaper is expressed in this place, and the guiding nature of a newspaper is also expressed in this place.

This requirement was first put forward by Chairman Mao. He requires us to be able to see them and be able to grasp them. To "see them," we must have a high degree of sensitivity and not suffer from eye diseases. Speaking of sensitivity, some people believe that this comes from talent. I don't think so. I say that sensitivity is based on a high degree of enthusiasm and comes from constant observation. As long as you are a person with a heart and not a person without a heart, have a high degree of enthusiasm for socialist things, and are in constant contact with things and pay attention to them at all times, then you may be able to discover new things in the budding stage. Conversely, if you are a person without a heart and your attitude towards socialism is plain and indifferent, then even if you have the best talent and intelligence, you will only turn a blind eye to new things in the budding stage. Even if it has grown and matured, you will still let it go and not have any interest in it. When I was in Yan'an, there was a small piece of land next to my residence where I planted some peppers, tomatoes, and the like. Yan'an is not like Guangzhou. Guangzhou has flowers in all seasons, but Yan'an has very few flowers. So I liked flowers very much at that time. Later, someone gave me two flower seeds, this kind of golden lotus flower, very elegant and fragrant, and it was very precious in Yan'an at that time. After I planted these two seeds, I made a special mark for it and went to see it every day. With such constant attention and observation, when it sprouted, although mixed among the vegetable seedlings and grass sprouts, I could immediately distinguish it. After sprouting, I took extra care to cultivate it and protect it well. In this way, further daily contact and daily observation allowed me to understand the process of its germination, growth, and development very clearly. I think that all new things under the socialist system should be treated like a gardener taking care of his favorite flower. Otherwise, how can you discover things in the budding stage? How can you grasp its essence in the new stage of development of things? How can you have foresight and premonition in your work?

Our newspapers do not pay enough attention to new things and do not promote them enough. This is a major shortcoming. Now, the creativity of the masses is endless, and new things are emerging one after another. The task of newspapers is to promote and vigorously promote these things when they are in the budding stage and promote their growth. Only in this way will our propaganda role be large enough, the ideology of the newspaper will be strong enough, and it will play the due guiding role in actual work.

Journalists Should Have Necessary and Diverse Knowledge

News work is written work, which requires attention to the skills of written expression and requires attention to techniques. Journalists are people who make a living by writing articles, but they sometimes feel that writing articles is very difficult. This is simply because there is nothing to write about, or there are opinions but they cannot be expressed. It can be seen that there are two aspects to writing articles: one aspect is the issue of thought and feeling, and the other aspect is the issue of writing skills. The former is fundamental, but the latter is also very important. We have all read a little bit of "classical Chinese commentary." We always feel less moved when reading Wang Bo's "Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng" than when reading Zhuge Liang's "Memorial on Dispatching the Army" or Li Mi's "Memorial Presenting the Facts." This is simply because although the "Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng" is written with sonorous rhythm, rich vocabulary, and great literary talent, it is full of empty talk and lacks thought and feeling. The "Memorial on Dispatching the Army" and "Memorial Presenting the Facts," on the other hand, are written honestly, and the feelings are more sincere. As long as the thoughts are clear and the feelings are rich, even if the writing skills are a little poor, it is possible to write relatively good articles. Of course, this does not mean that writing skills are not important. For example, I have come into contact with some grassroots cadres in rural areas. Their communist thoughts and feelings are very strong, and their love for the Party and their support for the general line are very firm. However, if you ask them to write reports or editorials, that is not possible, because they have not yet mastered writing skills. It can be seen that writing skills are very important. Otherwise, we would not need to organize professional news teams and we would not need to train "talented scholars." The reason why we have professional teams and train "talented scholars" is simply to have a group of people who can write articles so accurately, so vividly, and so vividly that people are infinitely convinced when they read them, feel that they are impeccable, are moved to be inspired, and applaud them. In this way, through their pens, the ideas of socialism and communism and the Party's policies can be accurately and powerfully disseminated to the people, firmly grasping the hearts of the people.

I think that there are not many good news stories, newsletters, headlines, and articles in the newspapers now, and great efforts are needed to improve them. The more common shortcomings are, first, the format is monotonous. It seems that everyone is imitating one or two formats. Imitating one or two works results in every article and newsletter always being like a pancake stamped out of a mold. Second, the vocabulary is poor and the language is tasteless, like a "bum." An article or newsletter, back and forth, is nothing more than words like "must," "should," "great," and "glorious." It is difficult to find novel and appropriate words, and well-tempered good sentences, and it is even more difficult to find lively mass language. Our Chinese characters, commonly used, are only one or two thousand, but when used, they are ever-changing, like playing chess. There are only thirty-two chess pieces, but masters never play the same game. Since journalists make a living by writing articles, they must work hard on writing. They must require that what they write is highly ideological, rich in emotion, fresh in style, and dazzling in literary talent, in line with the realm of "emotion and writing in harmony" proposed by Chairman Mao.

Some people believe that solving this problem only requires learning a little grammar and reading some literary books. I don't think that's the whole picture. This is not just about improving writing skills. More importantly, it is about increasing knowledge in various fields. In a word, it is about reading more books. Speaking of reading books, the most fundamental thing is to seriously study Chairman Mao's works, study Mao Zedong Thought, study the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, learn some philosophy, and learn some political economy. The Party's policies and the articles of the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee should be studied and researched well. In addition to this, we should also read some books related to production knowledge, technical knowledge, historical knowledge, and literary knowledge. For example, "Zizhi Tongjian" is very worthy of reading to increase historical knowledge. Reading a little poetry, lyrics, and odes can also extract some vital vocabulary from them and enrich the color of the article. The poems of Li Bai and Du Fu and the lyrics of Su Shi and Xin Qiji are very worthy of reading. Such as "Officialdom Unmasked," "The Scholars," "Stories Old and New," etc., can also be browsed. Foreign books can also be read a little, such as "Arabian Nights," "Aesop's Fables," and novels by famous writers can also be read. Since we work in Guangdong, then Qu Dajun's "New Guangdong Words" can also be read. Of course, reading these books does not mean that everyone is looking for a position or point of view there, but only to increase knowledge from them. These books do not need to be read too seriously, just browse them casually in your spare time. Over time, our minds will slowly become enriched, and writing articles will not always be dry.

In short, those of us who wield pens must make a great determination to increase knowledge. Mao Zedong's erudition is certainly not something that everyone can learn, but Mao Zedong's spirit of hard work and scholarship is something that everyone must learn. Mr. Lu Xun wrote two lines of poetry: "I have a word to remember, the gains and losses of articles are not from heaven." It can be seen that he emphasized that articles should be made with hard work and should not rely on talent. As long as we persevere, let's aim for ten years. If everyone can take ten years and make serious efforts, I think they can achieve great success. And all of this is to better propagate the Party's policies and propagate the truth of Marxism-Leninism, in order to achieve the goal of raising the socialist and communist awareness of the masses.

    思想  感情  文采
    中共广东省委第一书记　陶铸
    广东省的主要报刊和广播事业发展很快。除了南方日报、广州日报这两张省委和市委的机关报以外，又先后创办了羊城晚报和广东画报。这些报刊，发行数量已经不少。省、市人民广播电台每天播送五种节目，新的大发射台已经开始使用，全省到处都听得到广播。试验性的电视台也已经开始播送节目。一个城市，既有日报，又有晚报、画报，加上广播和电视，把它们通通办好了，那么，我们就有了强有力的宣传教育的工具，而人民群众的文化生活也就相当丰富了。在大城市里办一张晚报，我是很赞成的。一张晚报，既有时事政策宣传材料，又有增加知识、广见闻、提高文化的材料以补日报之不足；人们吃了晚饭，看看打球、下棋等等消息，至少也是一种娱乐，比天天逛街、打“五百分”有意义得多。看来，广东新闻工作的主要问题不在于数量的发展，而在于提高质量。
    要很好地研究党的政策，理解党的政策，坚定地宣传党的政策
    宣传党的路线、方针、政策，是党的报刊、广播的基本任务，因而也就是所有新闻工作者的基本任务。党的政策，从群众中来，反映了人民群众的意志和要求，代表着人民群众的利益，这是没有疑问的。但党的政策又需要到群众中去，为人民群众所接受、所掌握，见诸行动实践，化为实际生活。这当中，需要有一个过程；而党的新闻工具，在这个“从群众中来，又到群众中去”的过程中担当重要的角色，负有重要的责任，工作做得好不好，直接影响着这一过程的长或短、顺利或不顺利、健康或不健康等等。这本来已经是新闻工作者人所共知的道理了。可是，口讲是一回事，实做又是一回事，把这些人所共知的道理见诸实践，检查其效果的好坏优劣，那就会发觉它是并不容易办到的。这当中，包括有新闻工作者的立场、观点这样的根本问题。
    为什么现在要着重谈论这个问题？这同革命发展到了一个新的阶段有关。我们现在要高速度地建设社会主义，深入彻底地进行社会主义革命，这对于我们都还没有充分的经验。比如说，搞土改，我在好几个地区搞过，有了经验，什么是“左”、什么是右，怎么做叫做对、怎么做就不对，某一种现象是在什么条件下产生的，应当怎样处理等等，都比较熟悉。现在，我们搞社会主义革命和社会主义建设，时间还短，广大干部还缺乏经验，以致在贯彻执行党的路线、方针、政策的过程中，难免在工作中出点偏差，遇到一些困难。由于报纸担负着指导工作的任务，党的政策宣传得好不好，关系重大。因此，我们对新闻工作者，就要求他们比一般做实际工作的同志高明一些。尤其重要的是，在整整一个社会主义革命和社会主义建设的历史时期里，由于我们要彻底地消灭资本主义及其思想影响，要彻底地改造资产阶级和上层小资产阶级分子及其知识分子，这就不能不引起他们的反抗。我们搞社会主义革命和社会主义建设的目的，就是要最后消灭阶级。对这一点，资产阶级分子看得最清楚，比我们的不少同志还清楚；因此，从他们的阶级本能出发，他们总是千方百计地进行抵抗的，他们的主要手段就是要用他们的思想来影响工农群众、影响我们党内的不坚定分子。在我们党内，也常常有那么一小撮的不坚定分子成了资产阶级思想在党内的代表。在工农群众中，也还存在着许多旧思想、旧习惯，也会在他们的叫嚣下接受了他们的影响。这种阶级斗争的现象，也不能不反映到我们的新闻队伍里面来。所以，在新闻工作者当中，一定要不断地清除资产阶级的思想影响，在这方面，新闻工作者已经有了很多的经验教训。
    最主要的经验教训是什么呢？我以为是在新的历史时期当中，在无产阶级同资产阶级进行着复杂的、曲折的、长期的斗争当中，我们的新闻工作者必须坚定地宣传党的政策。前面说过，党的政策是从群众中来的、代表群众利益的，但要使党的政策为广大群众所接受，仍然需要有一个过程。在贯彻执行党的政策当中，广大群众由于存在有旧思想、旧习惯，需要进行教育，把他们的觉悟提高到党的政策的水平；同时资产阶级和上层小资产阶级分子又必定会进行抵抗，需要加以克服，并扫清他们在群众中的思想影响。因此，我们要求报纸必须坚定地宣传党的政策，必须对资产阶级思想进行斗争，对于客观存在的种种政治思想潮流，是赞成抑或反对，必须有明朗的态度。
    宣传党的政策，我们的报纸需要有这样的态度：你相信，我也是这样讲；你不相信，我也是这样讲；你骂娘，我也是这样讲；你喊万岁，我也是这样讲。采取这样坚定的态度来宣传党的政策，那就能够缩短群众接受党的政策的过程，反之，其结果也相反。这是不是盲目性？我以为，这是革命坚定性，不是盲目性。我们党中央和毛主席所制定的路线、方针、政策是完全正确的，它代表着绝大多数群众的利益，它指引着广大群众又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义，我们党的报纸为什么不应当坚定不移地去宣传呢？这种坚定不移的态度，乃是我们相信真理、拥护真理、传播真理、坚持真理，乃是我们对党中央和毛主席无限信赖的表现，怎能够说它是盲目性呢？在新闻工作队伍中，也还有不少的人很强调要“独立思考”。“独立思考”这个概念，抽象地看来是没有问题的；可是，如果对于党的路线、方针、政策等原则性问题，要求所谓“独立思考”，其实际就是要离开党的领导，迷失政治方向，其结果就会成为资产阶级思想的俘虏。
    需要知道，报纸和广播的影响很大，报纸一印几十万份，广播全省到处都听得到，对党的工作都是关系很大的，1957年，资产阶级右派向党进攻，他们也把锋芒指向报纸，说报纸“一味歌功颂德”。这就从反面证明，我们的报纸和广播坚定不移地宣传党的路线、方针、政策有着多么重大的意义。因此，我们就有理由要求搞新闻工作的同志更好地研究党的政策、理解党的政策，对党的政策有着最大的坚定性，要求他们比一般做实际工作的同志还要高明一些。这种要求虽然苛刻一些，但并不是过份的。自然，我们现在搞社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各项工作经验还不够充分，搞宣传工作的经验同样还不够充分，所以要达到这样的水平，需要作很大的努力。但是，只要我们对于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的几个根本问题，诸如社会主义的高速度发展问题、把社会主义革命进行到底问题、正确对待革命的群众运动问题，树立起坚定不移的观点，对党的各项政策和实际情况经常认真地研究，在实际斗争中不断地积累政治经验，那么，我们也就有可能在风浪中坐得稳、站得住，能够鉴别主流与支流，鉴别什么是暂时起作用的东西，什么是经常起作用的东西，并且逐步地做到对客观事物的发展有预见。而所有这些又归结到最根本的一条：完全自觉地听党的话，完全自觉地保证报纸、广播成为党的锐利的工具。
    要对事物有高度的热情和敏感
    我所说的事物，是社会主义的事物，也就是新生的事物。社会主义制度的本身，就是一个新生的事物。在社会主义制度下，又每时每刻都要出现大大小小的新事物。现在，我们有了在客观发展规律之下充分发挥人们的主观能动作用的总路线，我们在各项生产建设当中大搞群众运动，我们在大力地提倡敢想、敢说、敢干的风格，那真是英雄辈出，美不胜收，新生事物，层出不穷。所有这些新事物，都是有利于加速建设社会主义和从社会主义过渡到共产主义的。像这样的事物，难道还不值得用高度的热情来对待它们吗？
    任何新事物的诞生，都是要经过一场大喊大叫的；而它的成长又必然要经过同旧事物进行不调和的斗争。这种事物，既然是新生的，也就决不会一开始就十全十美，完善无缺；碰到存有旧思想、旧习惯的人，挑剔它的缺点，大概总可以讲出一百几十条。只有真正具备马克思列宁主义世界观的人，才会懂得，一切发展中的事物都是不完善的，革命的群众运动总难免有缺点或错误。而真正的马克思列宁主义者总是要把爱护、支持、促进新生事物的发展作为自己的职志，对于群众运动中的缺点则坚定地认为那充其量不过是“一个指头”的问题。新生事物的成长又总是要经过艰难曲折的。在这样复杂的和曲折的情况下，我们对于党的报纸和广播，对于所有的宣传工作者就不能不提出一个很高的要求。要求他们对所有的新事物，当它一经出现，当它还在萌芽状态的时候，就为它大喊大叫，大声疾呼，为它排除发展、成长道路上的一切阻力。一张报纸的思想性、战斗性就表现在这个地方，一张报纸的指导性也表现在这个地方。
    这种要求，首先是毛主席提出来的。他要求我们看得到，抓得起来。要“看得到”，就要有高度的敏感，不要患了眼病。谈到敏感，有人认为这是来自天赋。我看不是。我说敏感本乎高度的热情，来自经常的观察。只要你是有心人而不是无心人，对社会主义的事物有高度的热情，对事物经常接触、时刻注意，那你就有可能发现萌芽状态的新生事物。相反的，如果你是个无心人，对社会主义的态度是平平淡淡的，冷冷冰冰的，那你尽管有着多好的天赋聪明，对于萌芽状态的新生事物也只会视而不见，甚至等到它已经成长了、烂熟了，你仍然是会听之任之，不发生任何兴趣的。我在延安的时候，住宅边旁有块小小土地，种了些辣椒、西红柿之类。延安不比广州。广州四季常花，延安的花就很少。所以我当时很喜欢花。后来别人送给我两粒花种，这种金莲花，很雅致、很香，在延安当时是很名贵的。我把这两颗种子种上之后，就特别给它做个记号，天天都要去看看。这样的经常注意观察，当它一出芽，虽然混杂在菜苗与草芽之中，也一下子能够把它辨别出来，出芽之后，就加意培养，好好保护。这样进一步天天地接触，天天地观察，对于它的萌芽、生长、发展的过程，就了解得很清楚。我想，对待社会主义制度下的种种新生事物，都应当像园丁照顾最心爱的花那样，否则，你怎能够发现萌芽状态的东西呢？怎能够在事物发展的新阶段抓住它的本质呢？怎能够在工作中有远见、有预见呢？
    我们的报纸对新生事物注意得不够，提倡得不够，这是一个大缺点。现在，群众的创造是无穷无尽的，新生事物是层出不穷的，而报纸的任务在于对这些事物能够在萌芽状态的时候，大事宣传，大加提倡，促其成长。只有这样，我们的宣传作用才够大，报纸的思想性才够强，对实际工作才能起到应有的指导作用。
    新闻工作者要具有必要的多方面的知识
    新闻工作是文字工作，需要讲求文字表现的工夫，需要讲求技巧。新闻工作者是靠文章吃饭的人，可是不时又会感到写文章很苦，这无非是因为没有什么东西好写。或者有意见而表达不出来，可见写文章存在有两个方面的问题，一个方面是思想感情问题，一个方面是文字技巧问题。前者是基本的，而后者也很重要。我们大都读过一点“古文评注”。我们读王勃的“滕王阁序”总不若读诸葛亮的“出师表”、李密的“陈情表”之受感动。这无非是“滕王阁序”虽然写得音韵铿锵，词汇丰富，很有文采，可是空话连篇，没有思想感情；而“出师表”、“陈情表”则老老实实地写来，感情却比较真挚之故，只要思想明确，感情丰富，尽管文字技巧差一些，也可以写出比较好的文章来，当然，这并不是说，文字技巧不重要。比如，我接触过一些农村基层干部，他们的共产主义思想感情可强烈了，对党的爱戴，对总路线的拥护，坚定得很；可是，你要他写报道、写社论，那可不行，因为他们还没有掌握文字技巧。可见文字技巧是很重要的，要不然，我们就没有必要去组织专业的新闻队伍，没有必要去培养“秀才”了。我们之所以要有专业队伍、要培养“秀才”，用意无非是要有一批人，能够把文章写得那么准确、那么鲜明、那么生动，使人们看了无限信服，感到无懈可击，为之感动奋发，为之击节赞赏。这样一来，通过他们的笔杆，把社会主义、共产主义的思想，把党的政策，准确而有力地传播到人民群众当中，牢牢地抓住人民群众的心。
    我看，现在报纸上好的新闻、通讯、标题、文章都不多，要用很大的力量改进。比较大量存在的毛病，一是格式单调。看来大家都在模仿一两种格式。模仿某一两篇作品，结果是每篇文章、通讯总是像一个饼印印出来的那样。再就是语汇贫乏、语言无味，像个“瘪三”。一篇文章、通讯，翻来复去，无非是“必须”、“应该”、“伟大”、“光辉”等字样，难于找到新颖、贴切的词汇，经过锤炼的好句，更难找到生动活泼的群众语言。我们中国的文字，常用的不过一两千，但运用起来，千变万化，好像下棋那样，棋子只有三十二个，但名手下棋，从来不会有一局下得同一个样的。既然新闻工作者靠文章吃饭，那就必须在文字方面下工夫，要求写出的东西思想性很强，感情很丰富，格调清新，文采夺目，合于毛主席所提出的“情文并茂”的境界。
    有人认为，解决这一问题只要学点文法，看点文艺书，那就够了。我以为不尽然。这不仅仅要提高文字技巧，更重要的是增长多方面的知识。一句话，就是要多读书。谈到读书，最根本的一条是认真学习毛主席的著作，学习毛泽东思想，学习马克思列宁主义的基础知识，学点哲学，学点政治经济学。党的政策、党中央领导同志的文章，要很好学习、研究。除此之外，还应当读点有关生产知识、技术知识、历史知识、文学知识的书。例如“资治通鉴”就很可以读一读，以增加历史知识。诗词歌赋读一点，也可以从中吸取一些有生命的词汇，丰富文章的色彩。李杜之诗、苏辛之词就很值得一读。诸如官场现形记、儒林外史、今古奇观等等，也可以翻翻。外国书也可以读一点，诸如天方夜谭、伊索寓言以及名家小说也可以看看。我们既然在广东工作，那么，屈大钧的“广东新语”也是可以读读的。当然，读这些书，并不是叫大家在那里找立场、观点，只是从中增长知识。这些书，也无须乎读得太认真，只要在有空的时候，随便翻翻，日积月累，我们的头脑也就慢慢地充实起来，写文章也不会老是干巴巴了。
    总之，我们摇笔杆的人，都要下很大的决心去增长知识。毛主席的渊博，固然不是我们每一个人都能学得到；但是，毛主席的刻苦治学精神，则是我们每一个人所必须学的。鲁迅先生写过两句诗：“我有一言应记取，文章得失不由天”。可见他是强调文章要下苦功，不赖天赋的。只要持之有恒，就期以十年吧，大家如果能够拿十年的时间来，经过认真的努力，我想是可以大有所成的。而这一切都是为了更好地宣传党的政策，宣传马克思列宁主义的真理，以达到提高群众的社会主义、共产主义觉悟的目的。
