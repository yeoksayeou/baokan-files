Secretary Takes the Lead, Broadening Water Sources
中共武山县委会 (The Chinese Communist Party Wushan County Committee)

Inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Tenth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Provincial Party Committee, the people of Wushan County, Gansu Province, are holding high the banner of diverting water from the Dongliang Canal up the mountains. With the five Liang (Dongliang Mountain, Xiliang Mountain, Nanliang Mountain, Beiliang Mountain, Zhongliang Mountain), six Dragons (Donglong Mountain, Xilong Mountain, Nanlong Mountain, Beilong Mountain, Zhonglong Mountain, Qinglong Mountain), three Ridges (Beiling Ridge, Nanling Ridge, Dongling Ridge), and four Canals (Qingxi South Canal, Qingxi North Canal, Muyu Canal, Jinpan Canal) as the focal points, and with a momentum exceeding the steel production campaign of 1958, they are determined to bring water to the fields and eliminate drought in the winter.

Since the launch of the mountain and water management campaign in early October last year, Wushan County is advancing with unstoppable force, surging forward, and progressing rapidly. More than 200,000 water conservancy workers across the county are splitting mountains, blasting rocks, and diverting river water up the mountains; managing gullies to create "seas," intercepting and storing all available water; and vigorously developing underground reservoirs to maximize the exploitation of underground water sources. On every construction site, the sounds of ramming, singing, and explosions shake the mountains and rivers. On the basis of the original 637,000 mu of irrigated land in 1958, the people of the county, in just over two months, by December 20 last year, completed 145 major projects, moved more than 12 million cubic meters of stone, built and repaired 6 reservoirs, 441 canals, 320 underground reservoir groups, more than 16,500 wells, more than 66,600 water storage cellars, more than 42,900 springs, ponds, dams, and weirs, and more than 6,600 other projects, expanding and repairing irrigated land by more than 310,000 mu. While vigorously developing water conservancy, they also carried out winter irrigation on more than 523,000 mu.

The characteristics of the water conservancy construction movement in Wushan County are: tight leadership, solid measures, large scale, rapid action, swift progress, high project quality, and immediate results. The main reasons for achieving the above results are:

Put politics in command, greatly boost enthusiasm, and launch a mass movement. At the beginning of the movement, the county, communes, and teams all established specialized command organizations, led by the first secretary or secretary of the Party committee, implementing a system where the headquarters goes to the construction site, the office goes to the field, personnel are divided into shifts, each is responsible for their duties, unified command, line-by-line connections, close coordination, and joint promotion. In order to turn the resounding slogan of "Increase production significantly without rain, reap a bumper harvest in the face of severe drought" proposed by the Provincial Party Committee into the actual action of the people of the whole county, first of all, Party committees at all levels focused on political and ideological work. At various water conservancy construction sites and production teams, more than 500,000 people were mobilized to deeply discuss issues such as "Does a bumper harvest depend on heaven or on people?" and "Can people's communes overcome drought?" through summarizing the experience of this year's bumper harvest and the superiority of the people's communes over the past year, using the method of the masses educating themselves. On this basis, using "Four Checks" and "Four Calculations" as the content, the four main ideological obstacles in the water conservancy movement were further overcome. That is, by checking enthusiasm and calculating potential, some people's thinking that "more cannot be good, and good cannot be fast" was overcome, and the idea of a double leap in quantity and quality was established; by checking quality and calculating investment, some people's thinking of not believing in the power of the masses and only reaching out to higher authorities for investment was overcome, and the idea of relying on the masses and running water conservancy projects diligently and thriftily was established; by checking inventions and calculating labor savings, some people's thinking that key projects could not be done with indigenous methods was overcome, and the idea of launching indigenous methods and mechanization, skillfully repairing water conservancy projects, and achieving high speed in water conservancy construction was established; by checking water conservancy potential and calculating the contrast between water conservancy development before and after liberation, various difficulties of some people were overcome, and the idea of definitely eliminating drought this winter was established, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the masses. Then, the construction sites launched a mass movement of "What strategies do you offer for achieving a significant increase in production without rain and a bumper harvest in the face of severe drought next year?" In order to do a good job in drought prevention and resistance in the arid areas of the North Mountain, Zhang Shicun, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, and Zhang Ziqiang, the secretary, visited the masses in Anyuan and Jinshan areas of the North Mountain, which are the most arid and lack water sources, mobilized old farmers to offer advice, and summarized drought prevention and resistance measures for developing the underground reservoir movement in these areas in accordance with local conditions. The Secretariat of the County Party Committee also convened a consultation meeting of old farmer consultants, and summarized fifty effective drought prevention and resistance experiences from various places. According to the strategies offered by various places, the County Party Committee carefully studied and discussed, and made ten major resolutions on drought prevention and resistance, which immediately turned into the actual action of the people of the whole county.

Unified planning, regional classification, adapting to local conditions according to the characteristics of different regions, and simultaneously grasping "Three Waters." In order to correctly implement the "Three Main" guidelines and achieve a three-way combination of diversion, storage, and utilization of "Three Waters" (sky, ground, and underground), various localities conducted a general survey of large and small water sources and made unified plans under the slogan of "Storing water is like storing grain, repairing canals is like repairing granaries" and "Store a drop of water this winter, and you will definitely harvest a grain next year." The whole county was divided into four categories of areas, and different measures were taken to carry out the drought prevention and resistance movement in a solid manner.

In the southern mountainous areas with relatively abundant water sources and the arid areas of the North Mountain where new canals are being built to divert water up the mountains, on one hand, canals are being built with the five Liang, six Dragons, three Ridges, and four Canals as the focal points to divert water up the mountains; on the other hand, ponds and reservoirs are being built, land is being leveled, and soil and water are being conserved, vigorously promoting the experience of the people of Dongliang Mountain in creating a "forest connecting the river, the river connecting the reservoir, the reservoir connecting the canal, the canal connecting the pond, the pond connecting the cellar, and the cellar covering the mu," to achieve mountain land irrigation networks, conserve water sources, use surplus to make up for shortages, and ensure the need for water in all seasons. After this experience was fully promoted in 1,438 large, medium, and small canals diverting water up the mountains throughout the county, 6 reservoirs have been built and repaired so far, 4,292 ponds and dams capable of storing 300 to 1,500 cubic meters of water have been built, 55 ponds have been connected to reservoirs, more than 66,000 water storage cellars have been excavated, and 64,473 mu of terraced fields have been repaired and land has been leveled. In the more than 400 canals that are being continued and newly built in these areas this winter, the spirit of repairing and irrigating simultaneously, repairing a section, completing a section, and irrigating a section is being implemented, and 282,423 mu of land have been irrigated.

In the arid mountainous areas of Lixin, Jinshan, Jinyin, Huaguo, and Tielong in the north, where water sources are scarce, a large-scale "100 cubic meters of water storage per mu movement centered on underground reservoirs" is being carried out. That is, wells are drilled in series, cellars are dug in groups, connected to each other, and linked together to form a small underground reservoir network, intercepting and storing water from the sky, diverting and storing water from the ground, digging out underground water, and using various water lifting tools for diversion and irrigation, point-by-point irrigation, and suction spray irrigation, in order to completely change the arid face of these areas. Under the slogan of "Reservoirs, ponds, dams, and cellars are closely linked, no need to rely on heaven in 100 days of drought, store all the water from the sky and underground, and use surplus to irrigate fertile fields," Lixin Commune mobilized more than 12,000 people and has completed 3,000 underground reservoirs, repaired 237 pond dams, drilled wells and dug cellars 1,043, and dug mountain springs 253, irrigating a total of 35,669 mu of land. Under the slogan of "Build dams when you see a ditch, store water when you see a bend, every piece of land has a cellar, every plot has a well," the Jinyin mountainous area of Luomen Commune launched a movement of "One pond per 100 mu, one dam per 10 mu, one cellar per mu," and has fully utilized all the large and small water sources of more than 500 mountain springs and gully water sources in the entire territory. On the basis of the original 9,344 mu of irrigated land, 1,600 water cellars have been dug so far, 2 canals have been repaired, and 5,435 ponds, dams, springs, and wells have been dug, plus the original projects, reaching an average of 3.2 mu of irrigated land per person, and more than 310,000 cubic meters of water have been stored. In this type of arid mountainous area, more than 65,000 various large and small water conservancy projects have been built throughout the county, basically ensuring drought and flood protection for 1.1 million mu of land.

In the dry tableland areas, based on the situation that water sources are relatively scarce and water conservancy measures are weak, on the one hand, canals are being built to divert water, seeking distant water to quench immediate thirst; on the other hand, the favorable opportunity of winter is being seized to vigorously carry out ice river, ice dam, ice belt, and snow cellar movements, and to release and store water for spring use as early as possible. In some areas with suitable conditions, the masses are being mobilized to spread sand to combat drought. After classifying and ranking all the land, Chengguan Commune intercepted and stored gully water, spring water, and water from the sky in the dry tableland areas, and carried out a 100 cubic meters of medicine water per mu movement using open spaces, waterlogged land, gully water, and dry cellars, cutting off the flow of large and small ditches and freezing the diverted water to maximize water storage. In more than 20 days, 267 ice rivers, 801 ice dams, 54 ice belts, and 230 snow cellars have been built, storing more than 100,000 cubic meters of water, which can irrigate more than 31,000 mu of land. In this type of area throughout the county, the water intercepted by ice rivers, ice dams, ice belts, and snow cellars can irrigate a total of 150,000 mu of land, and more than 40,000 mu have been irrigated by point irrigation, and more than 80,000 mu have been back-carried with ice and accumulated snow, and more than 14,000 mu have been covered with sand, thereby greatly strengthening the drought prevention and resistance capabilities of the dry tableland areas.

In areas with more existing river water conservancy projects, large-scale river network projects are being carried out to expand and improve the irrigated area. In this type of area, there are 1,225 existing canals and 190,000 mu of land, all of which are irrigated land. Starting in October, the focus has been on garden-like land management and land leveling, with unified planning, rational arrangement of canals, and the construction and excavation of branch canals and capillary canals to ensure that water is used to the maximum extent and every drop of water is contested, so that it can exert its maximum effectiveness. At present, more than 400 canals have been overhauled throughout the county, and 780,000 mu have been made garden-like, of which all of the more than 100,000 mu of river land have achieved: rivers connected to canals, smooth canal water flow; branch canals and capillary canals closely follow; every piece of land has branch canals for water, and every plot has small irrigation ridges. On the basis of completing the winter irrigation task, this type of area has broken with convention and carried out a second winter irrigation.

Comprehensive measures are being taken to carry out the "100,000 mu of drought-resistant and high-yield farmland movement" to promote the in-depth development of the drought prevention and resistance movement. In terms of comprehensive measures, this winter, special attention has been paid to deep plowing of land, soil improvement, and the realization of garden-like cultivation; fertilization and moisture retention; and vigorous implementation of soil and water conservation field projects to control soil erosion. At present, 740,000 mu of land have been deeply plowed throughout the county, 780,000 mu have been made garden-like, 1,101 square kilometers of new soil erosion control area has been established, and drought prevention and resistance experiences such as winter sowing of spring millet in arid areas have been adopted. Throughout the county, with the arid areas of the North Mountain as the main focus, the "100,000 mu of drought-resistant and high-yield farmland movement" has been carried out, implementing winter sowing in advance for three types of crops: spring millet, spring sorghum, and spring wheat, to defend against drought in the spring of next year. The sowing work of the "100,000 mu of drought-resistant and high-yield farmland" has been successfully completed.

The high tide of water conservancy construction in Wushan County is developing wave upon wave. Party and government leaders at all levels are implementing the spirit of grasping construction with one hand and grasping life with the other, mobilizing the masses, and widely carrying out the "advance into 1960, technological revolution and cultural revolution, labor exceeding quotas, actual output exceeding plans, backward surpassing the advanced, comparing enthusiasm, comparing measures, comparing progress, comparing effectiveness, competition forming a network, pacesetters forming rows, red flags forming forests, and experiences forming sets" movement on various construction sites and in various communes and teams, with political and ideological work as the guide, fully utilizing large-scale evaluations, checks, comparisons, convening on-site meetings, inserting red flags, establishing pacesetters, and other effective experiences to promote the continued in-depth development of the movement. Zhang Shicun, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, convened a meeting of the secretaries of various communes and brigades and production teams north of the Wei River in Lixin Commune, visited the site, and learned and promoted the underground reservoir network experience created by the masses in accordance with local conditions. The County Party Committee also convened an on-site meeting on tool reform at the North Liang Canal construction site, greatly promoting the high-efficiency movement of the water conservancy construction site, enabling the county to set up 42 relatively large-scale factories for lime, explosives, tool repair and manufacturing, and cement manufacturing on the water conservancy construction site in less than two months, relying on its own efforts and using local materials. 615 types of advanced tools for excavation, transportation, and compaction, etc., and 11 types of water lifting tools have been created and widely promoted, with the work efficiency generally increasing by three to five times, and reaching a maximum of 60 times. Various departments have also put forward the slogan of "Support wherever it is needed, and support whatever is needed," and support is being provided from all directions, making the water conservancy construction site a scene of spring everywhere.

    书记挂帅　广开水源
    中共武山县委会
    甘肃省武山县人民在党的八届八中全会和省委第十次全体会议（扩大）精神的鼓舞下，高举东梁渠引水上山的旗帜，正在以境内的五梁（东梁山、西梁山、南梁山、北梁山、中梁山）、六龙（东龙山、西龙山、南龙山、北龙山、中龙山、青龙山）、三岭（北岭、南岭、东岭）、四渠（清溪南渠、清溪北渠、沐浴渠、金盘渠）为重点，以超过1958年大闹钢铁的声势，令万水归田，决心把干旱消灭在冬季。
    武山县从去年10月初开展治山治水运动，目前正在势如破竹，汹涌澎湃，一日千里地前进。全县二十多万水利大军，劈山炸石，引河水上山；治沟造海，拦蓄一切可以利用的水；大搞地下水库，最大限度地挖掘地下水源。在每一处工地上夯声、歌声、爆炸声震撼山河。全县人民在1958年原有水地六十三万七千多亩的基础上，仅仅两月多时间，到去年12月20日就完成较大工程一百四十五处，石方一千二百多万方，兴修和整修水库六座，渠道四百四十一条，地下水库群三百二十处，水井一万六千五百多眼，蓄水窖六万六千六百多个，泉、塘、坝、堰四万二千九百多处，其它工程六千六百多处，兴修、整修扩大水浇地三十一万多亩。在大兴水利的同时，又冬灌了五十二万三千多亩。
    武山县兴修水利运动的特点是：领导抓的紧，措施扎实，规模大，行动快，进展迅速，工程质量高，立竿见影。能够获得上述成绩的主要原因是：
    政治挂帅，大鼓干劲，大搞群众运动。运动一开始，县、社、队都成立了专门的指挥机构，由党委第一书记或书记挂帅，实行了指挥部到工地，办公室到田间，人马分班，各负其责，统一指挥，线线挂钩，紧密配合，共同促进。为了把省委提出的“无雨大增产，大旱大丰收”的响亮口号，变成全县人民的实际行动，首先各级党委大抓政治思想工作，在各水利工地和生产队，发动五十多万人，通过总结今年大丰收的经验和总结一年来人民公社的优越性，以群众自己教育自己的办法，深入讨论了“大丰收靠天还是靠人”“人民公社能不能战胜干旱”等问题，在此基础上，以“四查”“四算”为内容，进一步克服了水利运动中的四种主要思想障碍。这就是通过查干劲、算潜力，克服了一些人认为“多了不能好，好了不能快”的思想，树立了数量质量双跃进的思想；通过检查质量、算投资，克服了一些人不相信群众力量，只伸手向上要投资的思想，树立了依靠群众、勤俭办水利的思想；通过查创造发明、算节省劳力，克服了一些人认为重点工程土办法搞不了的思想，树立了土法上马机械化，巧修水利实现水利建设高速度的思想；通过查水利潜力、算解放前后水利发展对比账，克服了一些人的种种畏难情绪，树立了一定要把干旱消灭在今冬的思想，大大鼓舞了群众的干劲。接着工地又开展了“你为明年无雨大增产，大旱大丰收，献什么计谋？”的群众运动。为了作好北山干旱地区的防旱抗旱工作，县委第一书记张十存和书记张自强，到最干旱、缺水源的北山的安远、金山一带访问群众，发动老农献计，总结出了这些地区因地制宜，开展地下水库运动的防旱抗旱措施；县委书记处还召开了老农顾问献计会，总结出了各地行之有效的五十条防旱抗旱经验。根据各地献出的计谋，县委认真研究讨论，作出了防旱抗旱十大决议，立即变成了全县人民的实际行动。
    统一规划，分区分类，根据不同地区的特点，因地制宜，“三水”齐抓。为了正确贯彻“三主”方针，做到天上、地面、地下“三水”的引、蓄、用三结合，各地在“蓄水如蓄粮，修渠如修仓”、“今冬蓄下一滴水，明年定打一粒粮”的口号下，对大小水源进行了普查，统一作规划。全县分为四类地区，采取不同措施，扎扎实实地开展了防旱抗旱运动。
    在水源比较充足的南部山区和新修引水上山渠道的北山干旱地区，一面以五梁、六龙、三岭、四渠为重点兴修引水上山渠道，一面修筑塘库、平整土地、保持水土，大力推广东梁山人民创造的“林连河、河连库、库连渠、渠连塘、塘连窖、窖包亩”的实现山地灌溉网经验，涵养水源，以余济缺、保证四季用水需要。全县在一千四百三十八条大、中、小型引水上山渠道全面推广这一经验后，到目前已修筑和整修水库六座，修挖能蓄水三百方至一千五百方的塘坝四千二百九十二座，塘连库五十五个，开挖蓄水窖六万六千多个，并修梯田、平整土地六万四千四百七十三亩。今冬在这类地区续修新修的四百多条渠道，贯彻边修、边灌、修一段、成一段、灌溉一段的精神，已灌地二十八万二千四百二十三亩。
    在北部的礼辛、金山、金银、花果、铁笼等干旱山区，水源缺乏，大搞“以地下水库为中心的每亩蓄水百方运动”。就是打井成串，打窖成群，互相串通，连成整体，形成小型地下水库网，拦蓄天上水，引蓄地面水，挖出地下水，利用各种提水工具进行引灌，提水点浇，吸水喷灌，以彻底改变这类地区的干旱面貌。礼辛公社在“库塘坝窖紧相连，百日大旱不求天，蓄尽天上地下水，以余济缺灌良田”的口号下，出动一万二千多人，已完成地下水库三千个，修管塘坝二百三十七座，打井挖窖一千零四十三个，挖山泉二百五十三个，共浇地三万五千六百六十九亩。洛门公社金银山区在“见沟打坝、见弯蓄水、地地有窖、块块有井”的口号下，开展了“百亩一塘，十亩一坝，一亩一窖”的运动，已将全境五百多处山泉、沟水的大小水源全部利用起来，在原有水浇地九千三百四十四亩的基础上，至目前已挖成水窖一千六百个，修渠两条，挖塘、筑坝、挖泉、打井五千四百三十五个，加上原有工程，达到每人平均有水浇地三亩二分，已蓄水三十一万多公方。全县在这类干旱山区，已修筑各种大小型水利工程六万五千多处，使一百一十万亩土地基本作到了旱涝双保险。
    在旱塬地区，根据水源比较缺少，水利措施薄弱的情况，一边修渠引水，求得远水解近渴，一边抓紧冬季有利时机，大搞冰河、冰坝、冰带、雪窖运动，及早放蓄春季用水。并在部分有条件的地区，发动群众铺砂抗旱。城关公社将全部土地进行分类排队后，在旱塬地区拦蓄沟水、泉水、天上水，利用空地、涝地、沟水、旱窖开展了每亩药水百方运动，截断大小沟溪流水，引水冻结，最大限度地蓄水。二十多天时间，已搞冰河二百六十七处，冰坝八百零一个，冰带五十四条，雪窖二百三十个，蓄水十多万公方，可灌地三万一千多亩。全县这类地区利用冰河、冰坝、冰带、雪窖已拦蓄的水共可灌地十五万亩，目前已点浇四万多亩，并背冰积雪八万多亩，铺沙一万四千多亩，从而大大加强了旱塬地区的防旱抗旱能力。
    在河川原有水利工程较多地区，大搞河网化工程，扩大和改善灌溉面积。这类地区，现有渠道一千二百二十五条，土地十九万亩，全部为水地，从10月份开始，就以园田化，平整土地为中心，统一规划，合理摆布渠道，修挖支渠毛渠，达到有水必用，滴水必争，使其发挥最大实效。目前全县已检修渠道四百多条，实现园田化七十八万亩，其中十多万河川土地全部达到了：河连渠，渠水畅通；支渠毛渠紧相跟；地地有支渠通水，块块培起灌水小畦。这类地区在已完成冬灌任务的基础上，又打破常规地开展了第二次冬灌。
    采取综合性措施，开展“十万亩抗旱高产田运动”，促进防旱抗旱运动的深入开展。在综合性措施方面，今冬大抓特抓了深翻土地，改良土壤，实现耕作园田化；加肥保墒，大力开展水土保持田间工程，控制水土流失。现全县已深翻土地七十四万亩，实现耕作园田化七十八万亩，新控制水土流失面积一千一百零一平方公里，还采用总结干旱地区群众春谷冬种等防旱抗旱经验，全县以北山干旱地区为主，开展了“十万亩抗旱高产田运动”，实行春谷、春糜、春麦三类作物提前冬播，防御明年春季旱象侵袭。“十万亩抗旱高产田”的播种工作，已胜利完成。
    武山县兴修水利的高潮正在一浪高一浪的向前发展着。各级党政领导贯彻一手抓施工，一手抓生活的精神，发动群众，在各工地、各社队广泛开展了“提前跨入1960年，技术革命和文化革命，劳动超定额、实产超计划、后进超先进，比干劲、比措施、比进度、比实效，竞赛成网、标兵成列、红旗成林、经验成套”运动，以政治思想工作为纲，充分运用大评、大查、大比，召开现场会议，插红旗、立标兵等等行之有效的经验，促进运动的继续深入开展。县委第一书记张十存同志在礼辛公社召开各公社和渭河以北各公社、大队、生产队书记会议，现场参观，学习推广了群众因地制宜创造的地下水库网经验。县委又在北梁渠工地召开工具改革现场会议，大大促进了水利工地的高工效运动，使全县不到两个月时间，就在水利工地上自力更生、就地取材地办起了石灰、炸药、工具修配制造、水泥制造等较大型的工厂四十二处，已重点创制挖方、运输、夯实等先进工具六百一十五种，提水工具十一种，普遍进行了推广，工效一般提高三至五倍，最高达到六十倍。各部门还提出：“哪里需要就支援到哪里，需要什么就支援什么”的口号，四面八方进行支援，使水利工地到处是一片春色。
