Xinhua News Agency, 8th: World opinion strongly condemns the anti-Jewish movement stirred up by fascists in many Western capitalist countries.

The "Neues Deutschland" of the German Democratic Republic wrote that the events in West German cities show that the Bonn regime, like the regime of Hitler's "Third Reich," is permeated with the spirit of chauvinism and racism. The newspaper exposed the West German ruling clique's attempt to conceal the real reasons for the rampant activities of the fascists from the public. Lothar Bolz, General Secretary of the Christian Democratic Union of the German Democratic Republic, pointed out that the new provocations of the fascists once again show that fascist forces are rising again in West Germany. The Presidium of the "Free German Youth," a unified front organization of all German youth, expressed its firm protest against the rampant activities of the West German fascists, demanding an immediate ban on the activities of all fascist and militarist organizations in West Germany.

West German Trade Union Federation Chairman Richter also sent a telegram to West German Chancellor Adenauer, demanding severe punishment for fascist organizations.

The National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany issued an appeal to all the German people, calling on them to fight to drive war criminals and active Nazis out of the West German government, army, Ministry of Justice and police force, as well as large business enterprises, and to remove those who poison the minds of young people from schools and publishing houses. The appeal called on all honest and peace-loving people in the world to help German patriots stop the practice of spreading this fascist poison in West Germany and West Berlin.

A gathering of former Auschwitz concentration camp prisoners in Prague on the 6th called on the democratic public worldwide to fight against the revival of fascism and the anti-Semitic wave. "Rude Pravo" pointed out in a commentary yesterday that the recent Nazi provocations are the result of the Atlantic strategy of turning West Germany into a "fortress against the East," and the beginning of a road planned by Hitlerites who have regained power. "Rude Pravo" emphasized that Western countries should bear great responsibility for helping this development and for not fulfilling their obligations under the international treaties on post-war Germany.

The French "L'Humanité" has published commentaries for several days, pointing out that Western countries and the West German government are responsible for the anti-Semitic wave. On the 6th, the newspaper accused Western countries of violating the Potsdam Agreement, which stipulated the elimination of Nazism. On the 7th, the newspaper pointed out that Nazis occupy top important positions in West Germany. It said: "Since the Minister of Public Security of this government, Schröder, is a former Nazi dignitary, its Minister of Refugees, Oberländer, is responsible for the massacre of Jews, and its State Secretary Globke is a commentator on the former Nuremberg racial laws, how can people believe that this government will stop racist activities?"

The French "Movement Against Racism, Against Anti-Semitism and for Peace" organized a rally of thousands of people in Paris last night. The conference called on all democrats and all anti-racists to unite to protest the anti-Semitic wave.

The Central Committee of the French Human Rights League issued a statement expressing outrage at the anti-Jewish actions that have occurred in various countries. The statement called for the punishment of such criminal acts and demanded that the United Nations ensure that the principles declared in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are followed in all countries.

Several thousand students in Belgium held a rally last night to protest the anti-Semitic provocations of the fascists. The Belgian "Red Flag" pointed out that this provocation is the result of the long-term indulgence of fascist adventurers in West Germany and other countries.

Organizations of former resistance fighters and victims of Nazi persecution in Italy issued a statement in Rome condemning racism and said: "The democratic anti-fascist resistance movement stands with those affected by this provocation."

The anti-Jewish provocations in West Germany and many other Western countries have also aroused indignation among the Brazilian public. Congressman Norala condemned this as a stupid act. He believes that civilized countries should protest.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th: The Soviet "Pravda" today published an article by Polikanov, strongly condemning the anti-Jewish provocations of fascists in European capitalist countries. The article said that the swastika, the spider-shaped symbol of fascism, has reappeared in the cities and villages of West Germany. The purpose of the heinous fascist provocations and the appearance of the swastika is to promote the "Cold War" and instigate some nations to attack other nations. This provocative act against easing international tensions is particularly beneficial to the reactionary ruling clique in West Germany, which is busy arming the Bundeswehr.

    坚决制止法西斯主义的复活
    世界舆论严斥西方国家法西斯反犹挑衅
    据新华社8日讯　世界舆论严厉谴责许多西方资本主义国家法西斯分子所掀起的反犹太人运动。
    德意志民主共和国“新德意志报”写道，西德各城市所发生的事件表明，波恩政权同希特勒“第三帝国”的政权一样渗透着沙文主义和种族主义的精神。报纸揭露西德统治集团企图对公众掩饰法西斯分子猖獗活动的真正原因。德意志民主共和国基督教民主联盟总书记戈丁指出，法西斯分子新的挑衅再次表明，西德的法西斯势力正在重新抬头。全德国青年的统一战线组织“德国青年联盟”主席团对西德法西斯分子的猖獗活动表示坚决抗议。要求立即禁止一切法西斯军国主义组织在西德的活动。
    西德工会联合会主席里希特也打电报给西德总理阿登纳，要求严惩法西斯组织。
    民主德国全国阵线全国委员会发表了致全体德国人民的呼吁书，号召他们进行斗争，把战犯和积极的纳粹分子从西德政府、军队、司法部和警察部队以及大商业企业中赶出去，并且把那些毒害青年的思想的人从学校和出版社里清除出去。文告呼吁世界上一切正直的爱好和平的人帮助德国爱国者来制止在西德和西柏林散布这种法西斯毒素的做法。
    捷克斯洛伐克前奥斯威辛集中营被囚者6日在布拉格的集会，呼吁全世界的民主公众为反对法西斯主义的复活和反犹浪潮而斗争。“红色权利报”昨天在一篇评论中指出，最近的纳粹挑衅行动是把西德变成“针对东方的堡垒”的大西洋战略的后果，是再次掌权的希特勒分子所策划的道路的开端。“红色权利报”强调指出，西方国家由于帮助了这种发展，由于没有遵守关于战后德国的国际条约使他们自己所担负的义务，它们应当负重大的责任。
    法国“人道报”连日发表评论，指出西方国家和西德政府应对反犹浪潮负责。这家报纸在6日指责西方国家违背了规定要消灭纳粹主义的波茨坦协定。7日，报纸又指出，纳粹分子在西德占据头等重要职位。它说：“既然这个政府的公安部长施罗德是一名前纳粹显贵，它的难民部长奥勃兰德尔是屠杀犹太人的负责者，它的国务秘书格罗布克是前纽伦堡种族法的评论家，那么，人们怎能相信这个政府会制止种族主义活动呢？”
    法国“反对种族主义、反对反犹太人主义和拥护和平运动”昨天晚上在巴黎组织了上千人参加的大会。大会号召一切民主分子和一切反对种族主义的人团结起来，抗议反犹浪潮。
    法国人权联盟中央委员会发表声明，对各国发生的反犹太人行动表示愤怒。声明要求惩治这种犯罪行为，并且要求联合国保证在各国遵循人权宣言所宣布的原则。
    比利时有好几千名学生在昨天晚上举行了集会，抗议法西斯分子的反犹挑衅。比利时“红旗报”指出，这种挑衅是长期以来在西德及其它国家纵容法西斯冒险分子的结果。
    意大利前抵抗运动战士和受过纳粹迫害的人的组织在罗马发表声明，谴责种族主义，并且说：“民主反法西斯抵抗运动同那些受到这次挑衅影响的人站在一起。”
    在西德及其他许多西方国家发生的反犹太人挑衅活动也引起巴西公众的愤慨。议员诺拉拉谴责说，这是愚蠢的行为。他认为，文明的国家应当提出抗议。
    据新华社莫斯科8日电　苏联“真理报”今天发表了波利卡诺夫的一篇文章，严厉谴责欧洲资本主义国家的法西斯分子的排犹的挑衅活动。文章说，法西斯蜘蛛形的卐字标记又重新出现在西德的城市和村庄。万恶的法西斯挑衅和卐字标记的出现，其目的在于鼓吹“冷战”和唆使一些民族攻击另外一些民族。这种反对缓和国际紧张局势的挑衅行为，对正在忙于武装联邦国防军的西德反动统治集团是特别有利的。
