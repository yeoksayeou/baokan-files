　　The azure sky is without a trace of floating clouds. A coastal defense soldier stands on a high cape, the waves beating against the rocks at his feet, splashing up white foam.
　　Salt Field Fishing Port appears particularly calm. Apart from the sound of the waves lapping against the embankment, everything else seems tired from the sun and there is not a single sound. At this moment, from the gap in the harbor, patches of white sails appear. Then, from the noise of the waves, comes a faint sound of engines. The fishing fleet, having gone out to sea to fish, has returned victoriously under the protection of the coastal defense soldiers.
　　As the fleet approached Salt Field Fishing Port, a large crowd gathered on the beach. People were laughing, shouting, and busying about, and the whole fishing port was in an uproar!
　　"The fleet returns to the harbor, heave-ho!
　　Fresh fish, cabin after cabin, heave-ho!
　　Everyone unload quickly, heave-ho!
　　Unload and then go to sea again, heave-ho!..."
　　Laughter and shouts drowned out the noise of the waves, rippling in the sky above the fishing port, slowly drifting out to the vast sea.
　　Sturdy fishermen, using a wide and long gangplank, carried basket after basket of fresh fish from the cabin to the shore. Their purplish-brown skin shone brightly in the sun. Staff at the aquatic products company busied themselves weighing and registering the fresh fish, the abacus placed on the beam of the scales, clicking and clacking. Fisher girls in floral tops took the baskets of fresh fish, placed them on wheelbarrows, and sent them to the processing plant and the seaside drying ground according to type.
　　The wheelbarrows, loaded with baskets of fresh fish, hummed a little tune, and the fisher girls' faces flushed with joyful red clouds, and their eyes seemed particularly bright. Run, run! They pushed the carts, running on the road to the drying ground. Laugh, laugh! Their silver bell-like laughter flew to the drying ground, accompanied by the little song of the wheels.
　　The fresh fish were delivered to the drying ground, which kept the women and children on the ground busy. They poured basket after basket of fresh fish onto straw mats, arranging them one by one. The silver scales of the fish glittered white in the sun. They busied themselves in this silver ocean, their movements so nimble and skillful. The scorching sun shone on them, and sweat flowed down their faces.
　　On the wharf side, several large trucks were parked, and people moved basket after basket of fresh fish sprinkled with salt onto the trucks; from the processing plant, boxes of canned fish and jars of fish sauce were transported out, as well as baskets of salted fish, filling several carriages. ...
　　The sun gradually moved to the west, the fish on the boat was unloaded, and people used wheelbarrows to send bags of rice, baskets of dried vegetables, fresh vegetables, bundles of firewood, buckets of fresh water, and jars of kerosene into the cabins.
　　The sun sank into the western hills, and dusk enveloped the entire fishing port. People who had been busy all day gradually dispersed, and the noisy fishing port began to quiet down again.
　　A bright moon rose from behind the mountains in the bay, casting a faint blue light over the entire fishing port. The lights of Salt Field Town came on, the fishing lights on the boats came on, and the boats raised their sails and went out to sea again in the moonlight. Standing on the breakwater in the harbor, looking through the port, the sea shone with rows of neat lights. At this time, a cool sea breeze brought a melodious song:
　　"Fishing at sea on a moonlit night, heave-ho-ho!
　　Thousands of boats cast tens of thousands of nets, heave-ho-ho!
　　The first net hauls up a cabin full of fish, heave-ho-ho!
　　The second net hauls up a round of moonlight, heave-ho-ho!..."
　　The song echoed and rippled in the sky above the fishing port.

    欢乐的渔港
    刘海文　廖月晖
    蔚蓝的天空，没有一丝浮云。海防战士站立在高高的海岬上，海浪拍打着他脚下的岩石，溅起了白色的浪花。
    盐田渔港显得格外平静。除了那海浪拍击堤岸发出的哗哗声，其它一切都像被太阳晒疲倦了似的没有一点声响。这时，从港湾的豁口，出现了一片片白色的渔帆。接着，从海浪的喧响中，传来了一阵轻微的轮机声。出海捕鱼的船队，在海防战士的护卫下，胜利归来了。
    船队靠近了盐田渔港，顿时，沙滩上就聚集了一大群人。人们笑着、嚷着、忙碌着，整个渔港沸腾起来了！
    “船队回海港哟，嗨——哟！
    鲜鱼一舱舱哟，嗨——哟！
    大家快点卸哟，嗨——哟！
    卸完再出洋哟，嗨——哟！……”
    笑声、号子声盖住了海浪的喧响，荡漾在渔港上空，慢慢向辽阔的海面飘散开去。
    健壮的渔民，通过又宽又长的跳板，把一筐筐鲜鱼从舱内搬到岸上。他们那酱紫色的皮肤，在阳光下闪闪发亮。水产公司的工作人员忙着把鲜鱼过秤、登记，算盘放在磅秤的横梁上，被拨得噼啪作响。穿着花上衣的渔家姑娘，把一筐筐鲜鱼接过来，放到独轮车上，按种类分别送进加工厂和推向海滨晒鱼场。
    驮着满筐鲜鱼的独轮车，吱吱嘎嘎地哼起了小曲，渔家姑娘脸上泛起了欢乐的红云，眼睛也显得特别明亮。跑呀，跑呀！她们推着车子奔跑在通往晒鱼场的路上。笑呀，笑呀！她们那银铃般的笑声伴着车轮的小唱飞向晒鱼场。
    鲜鱼送到晒鱼场，这可忙坏了场上的妇女和小孩。他们把一筐筐鲜鱼倒在草席上，又一条条地摆开。银色的鱼鳞在阳光下闪着白光。他们就奔忙在这银色的海洋中，动作是那样敏捷，那样灵巧。火热的阳光射在他们身上，汗珠在脸上流淌。
    在码头那边，停放着几部大卡车，人们把一箩箩洒上了盐的鲜鱼搬到车上；从加工厂里，运出一箱箱鱼肉罐头和一坛坛鱼露，还有一篓篓咸鱼，装满了几个车厢。……
    太阳渐渐偏西，船上的鱼儿卸完了，人们又用独轮车把一袋袋的大米、一篓篓的干菜、鲜菜、一捆捆干柴、一桶桶淡水和一罐罐灯油送进船舱。
    太阳沉入西山去了，暮色笼罩了整个渔港。忙碌了一整天的人们逐渐散去了，喧闹的渔港又开始静下来。
    一轮明月从海湾里的山后升起，给整个渔港洒上了一层淡淡的青光。盐田镇的电灯亮了，船上的渔灯亮了，船儿拉起风帆，又乘着月色出海了。站在港湾里的防浪堤上，通过港口望去，海面闪耀着一排排整齐的灯光。这时，一阵清凉的海风，送来了一阵悠扬的歌声：
    “月夜捕鱼出海洋哟，嗨哟嗬！
    千船撒出万道网哟，嗨哟嗬！
    头网捞起满舱鱼哟，嗨哟嗬！
    二网捞起一轮明月光哟，嗨哟
      嗬！……”
    歌声在渔港上空回旋荡漾。
