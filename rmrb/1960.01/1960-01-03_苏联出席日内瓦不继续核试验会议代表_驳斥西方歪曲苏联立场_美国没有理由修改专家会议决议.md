Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 2nd. According to a TASS report from Moscow on December 31st: In light of recent reports in the Western press stating that Soviet experts at the Geneva conference on discontinuing nuclear weapons tests refused to seriously study American data on seismic methods for detecting underground nuclear explosions, Yevgeny Fyodorov, head of the Soviet technical expert group and corresponding member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, made the following statement to a "Pravda" reporter:

It is well known that the 1958 Eight-Nation Technical Experts Conference reached a unanimous conclusion on the complete possibility of detecting any nuclear explosion and the necessary tools for doing so. The experts' report and recommendations were endorsed by the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

Fyodorov continued by saying that, during the negotiations at the Geneva conference on discontinuing nuclear weapons tests, Western countries repeatedly demanded the re-examination of technical issues that had already been resolved. These demands were based on the grounds that new and important data regarding seismic methods for detecting underground nuclear explosions had been obtained as a result of the underground nuclear explosion conducted by the United States at the end of 1958, as well as recent underground chemical explosions imitating nuclear explosions.

In November and December of this year, Soviet experts thoroughly studied these American data at a special experts' meeting in Geneva.

Fyodorov pointed out that Soviet experts believe that conducting seismic observations during underground explosions is undoubtedly valuable for the activities of the monitoring system. It is now possible to propose a series of suggestions for improving the methods and instruments for detecting nuclear explosions. Such suggestions, put forward by both the American and Soviet sides, have been unanimously agreed upon by all participants in the conference.

At the same time, Soviet experts carefully analyzed all the materials submitted for discussion and categorically denied the American experts' interpretation of the original data in the document of January 5, 1959, as well as in the report at the most recent meeting.

Soviet experts found various errors in the American statements and documents, and sometimes even deliberately incorrect principles; based on the actual materials, Soviet experts, in many cases, reached different conclusions.

Fyodorov pointed out, for example, that Soviet experts do not believe there is reason to deny the practical possibility of distinguishing between explosions and earthquakes, which American experts actually seem to be doing. Nor is there any significant reason to revise the resolutions of the 1958 Experts' Conference.

Fyodorov believes that only the practical implementation of a monitoring system can best assess its effectiveness and improve it.

Clearly, the most urgent task should not be endless arguments about the possible shortcomings of the monitoring system, but rather to reach an agreement on the cessation of testing as soon as possible, approve the monitoring system, and improve this system based on experience gained.

    苏联出席日内瓦不继续核试验会议代表
    驳斥西方歪曲苏联立场
    美国没有理由修改专家会议决议
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科12月31日讯：鉴于最近西方报纸上出现了这样的消息，说什么在日内瓦的不继续核武器试验会议上，苏联专家拒绝认真研究美国关于发现地下核爆炸的地震方法资料，苏联技术专家小组组长、苏联科学院通讯院士叶夫根尼·费奥多罗夫对“真理报”记者发表谈话说：
  大家都知道，1958年八国技术专家会议就发现任何核爆炸的完全可能性和为此必需的工具问题得出了一致的结论。专家的报告和建议得到苏联、美国和英国政府的赞同。
    费奥多罗夫接着说，但是，在日内瓦不继续核武器试验会议的谈判过程中，西方国家屡次要求重新审查已经解决了的技术问题。这些要求的根据是：由于1958年底美国所进行的地下核爆炸以及最近几次进行的模仿核爆炸的地下化学爆炸，已经获得了有关发现地下核爆炸的地震方法的新的重要的资料。
    在今年11、12月间，在日内瓦专家特别会议上，苏联专家详细地研究了美国的这些资料。
    费奥多罗夫指出，苏联专家认为，在地下爆炸时进行地震观测，对监督系统的活动无疑是有价值的。就是现在也有可能提出一系列改进发现核爆炸的方法和仪器的建议。美国和苏联方面提出的这样一些建议，得到会议全体参加者的一致同意。
    同时，苏联专家仔细地分析了全部提交讨论的材料，断然否认美国专家在1959年1月5日的文件中以及在最近一次会议上的报告中对原来资料的解释。
    苏联专家在美国的声明和文件中发现各种错误，有时还发现故意搞错的原则；苏联专家根据那些实际材料，在许多情况下得出了不同的结论。
    费奥多罗夫指出，例如，苏联专家并不认为有理由否认区别爆炸和地震的实际可能性，而美国专家实际上却这样认为。也没有重大理由来修改1958年专家会议的决议。
    费奥多罗夫认为，只有实际实行监督制度才能最好地估价它的效果并使它得到完善。
    显然，最迫切的任务不应当是对监督制度可能产生的缺点进行无休止的争论，而是尽快地达成关于停止试验的协议、批准监督制度和在取得经验的基础上改进这种制度。
