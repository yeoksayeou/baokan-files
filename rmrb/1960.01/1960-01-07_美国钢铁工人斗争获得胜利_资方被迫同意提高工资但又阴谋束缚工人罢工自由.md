Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th. The United Steelworkers of America reached an agreement with eleven major steel companies on January 5th regarding the resolution of their labor dispute, signing a new two-and-a-half-year contract.

The new contract stipulates increases in workers' wages and improvements in welfare benefits, including increases in workers' wages, unemployment benefits, and pensions. In total, workers' hourly wages and welfare benefits will increase by 39 cents, which is about 40% more than the amount originally offered by the capitalists. Union officials believe this is a victory for the 500,000 steelworkers after nearly four months of strike action.

The new contract also stipulates that workers' wages will be adjusted according to changes in the cost of living. As for the so-called "work rules" issue raised by the capitalists with the aim of strengthening the "speed-up system," it will be submitted to a joint labor-management committee for discussion, and the decision of this committee is not binding.

However, it is worth noting that, according to United Steelworkers of America President McDonald, the new contract also stipulates the establishment of a so-called "Special Labor Peace Committee" composed of labor, capital, and "public representatives," with the aim of formulating methods to "avoid strikes" in future labor-management contract negotiations. This indicates that the capitalists are conspiring to tie the workers' hands, making it difficult for them to launch strikes in the future.

The United Steelworkers of America and the steel companies reached an agreement after "mediation" by U.S. Vice President Nixon and Labor Secretary Mitchell. The signing of the new contract signifies the formal end of the major strike by 500,000 steelworkers, which began on July 15th of last year. This strike was the longest in the history of the American steelworkers' struggle, and it had reduced the operating rate of the American steel industry by 87%, causing a total loss of $3.1 billion in profits for monopoly capital and tax revenue for the government. In order to suppress the steelworkers, the U.S. government invoked the Taft-Hartley Act on November 7th of last year, forcing the workers to temporarily return to work.

### 美国钢铁工人斗争获得胜利  资方被迫同意提高工资但又阴谋束缚工人罢工自由

    美国钢铁工人斗争获得胜利
    资方被迫同意提高工资但又阴谋束缚工人罢工自由
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国联合钢铁工人工会5日同十一家大钢铁公司达成了关于解决劳资纠纷的协议，签订了一个为期两年半的新合同。
    新合同规定提高工人工资和改善福利待遇，其中包括增加工人的工资、失业津贴和养老金。总计工人每小时的工资和福利津贴将增加三角九分美元，这比资方原来答应增加的数目约多40％。工会人士认为，这是五十万钢铁工人近四个月的罢工斗争的一个胜利。
    新合同还规定，工人的工资将随生活费用的变化而调整。至于资方提出的目的在于加强“加快制度”的所谓“工作条例”问题，则提交劳资联合委员会讨论，这个委员会的决定并没有约束力。
    但是，值得注意的是，据联合钢铁工人工会主席麦克唐纳说，新合同也规定成立一个由劳方、资方以及“公众代表”组成的所谓“特别劳工和平委员会”，目的是要拟订在今后缔结劳资合同时“避免发生罢工”的办法。这一点表明，资方阴谋束缚工人的手脚，使他们今后难以发动罢工。
    联合钢铁工人工会同钢铁公司是在美国副总统尼克松和劳工部长密契尔进行“调解”后达成协议的。新合同的签订，意味着从去年7月15日开始的五十万钢铁工人的大罢工正式结束。这次罢工是美国钢铁工人斗争历史上时间最长的一次罢工，它曾经使美国钢铁工业的开工率减少87％，使垄断资本的利润和政府的税收一共损失三十一亿美元。为了打击钢铁工人，美国政府去年11月7日曾经援用塔夫脱—哈特莱法，强迫工人暂时复工。
