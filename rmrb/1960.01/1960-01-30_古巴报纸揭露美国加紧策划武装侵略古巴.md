Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 28th: Facts revealed in Havana newspapers today show that while Eisenhower is talking loudly about the so-called "policy of non-interference in Cuba's internal affairs" and expressing his willingness to "maintain traditional friendship" with Cuba, the United States is stepping up its activities of armed aggression against Cuba.

    "Combate" reported that five B26 bombers that took off from Miami, USA, on the 25th have arrived in the Dominican Republic. The newspaper said that the enemies of the Cuban revolution intend to arm an air force with American planes to overthrow the Cuban government. "Combate" also reported that the foreign legion in the Dominican Republic is secretly gathering on the Turks Islands in the northern Dominican Republic. In Honduras, people are also stepping up preparations for armed aggression against Cuba. In addition, an airplane recently dropped an American-made radio station for counter-revolutionaries in Isabela de Sagua, Cuba. Farmer patrols seized the radio station and handed it over to the authorities.

    According to a report in "Noticias de Hoy" today, on the night of the 26th, another plane flew over the "Washington Sugar Factory" and the sugarcane fields operated by the National Agrarian Reform Institute in Las Villas Province. The plane's lights were all turned off, and the worker militia fired at the plane.

    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 27th: According to Prensa Latina, on the morning of the 26th, a plane dropped an incendiary bomb on the Soval estate in Las Villas province, and also dropped a device similar to a radio transmitter.

    Local farmers found the "transmitter" and discovered that it had English words "Made in USA" on it. The farmers witnessed the plane flying north from the coast of Las Villas province after carrying out the air strike.

    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 29th: Yesterday, the Cuban capital's newspapers continued to expose and condemn the United States for actively carrying out preparations for armed aggression against Cuba behind the smokescreen of Eisenhower's so-called "non-interference in Cuban affairs" statement. According to "Noticias de Hoy", in the past three days, many U.S. Air Force planes have been flying at low altitudes in the Bahia area of the Guantanamo Bay port in Cuba, dropping highly explosive bombs for so-called "exercises."

    "Revolución" reported that four hundred and eighty boxes of weapons and ammunition have been unloaded at Puerto Cortés in Honduras, transported to Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, and handed over to a foreign military mission there.

    At the same time, according to reports, another twin-engine plane from the United States dropped a large number of incendiary bombs on sugarcane fields in Camagüey Province on the afternoon of the 28th. The bombs were marked with the English words "Bristol Marine." In addition, another plane from the United States dropped an incendiary bomb at Padre Port in northern Oriente Province, Cuba.

    Prensa Latina reported that the Cuban ambassador to Panama announced on the 28th that there was information indicating that Batista elements were being trained in the Panama Canal Zone for the purpose of invading Cuba. The news agency also reported that rumors were circulating in Panama that former Air Force Commander Diaz Lanz, a Cuban traitor, was holding secret meetings with Batista elements in Panama. These meetings are linked to the U.S. imperialist-initiated plan to invade Cuba.

    The Cuban Movement for the Defense of Peace and Sovereignty Executive Committee issued a statement on the 28th saying that imperialist interest groups are stubbornly attempting to provoke armed aggression against Cuba, using the most absurd pretexts, which will be a violation of world peace. The statement warned that peace-loving people in every corner of the world will rise up against war.

    古巴报纸揭露美国加紧策划武装侵略古巴
    新华社哈瓦那28日电　今天哈瓦那报纸揭露的事实表明，在艾森豪威尔高谈所谓“不干涉古巴内政的政策”，并且表示愿意同古巴“保持传统的友谊”的同时，美国却加紧了武装侵略古巴的活动。
    “战斗报”报道说，25日从美国迈阿密起飞的五架B26型轰炸机已经到达多米尼加。这家报纸说，古巴革命的敌人打算用美国飞机武装一个航空队来推翻古巴政府。“战斗报”还报道，多米尼加的外国军团正秘密地向多米尼加北部的图尔卡斯群岛集结。在洪都拉斯，也有人在加紧准备对古巴的武装侵略。此外，一架飞机最近在古巴的圣伊萨贝尔给反革命分子投下了一个美国造的电台。农民巡逻队缴获了这架电台，并把它交给了当局。
    据“国家报”今天报道，26日夜间又有一架飞机飞临“华盛顿制糖厂”和土地改革全国委员会在拉斯维利亚斯省经营的甘蔗园上空。飞机上的灯全都关着，工人民兵朝这架飞机开了火。
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　据拉丁美洲通讯社报道，26日早晨有一架飞机在拉斯维利亚斯省上空向索瓦尔庄园投扔了一颗燃烧弹，同时还投下一个类似无线电发报机的器械。
    当地的农民找到这台“发报机”后发现上面有美国制的英文字样。农民们亲眼看到，这架飞机在进行空袭后从拉斯维利亚斯省海岸向北面飞去。
    据新华社哈瓦那29日电　古巴首都各报昨天继续揭露和谴责美国在艾森豪威尔所谓“不干涉古巴事务”的声明的烟幕后，积极进行武装侵略古巴的准备活动。据“国民报”报道，最近三天以来，很多美国空军的飞机在古巴关塔那摩海港的巴伊亚地区低空飞行、投掷爆炸力强大的炸弹进行所谓“演习”。
    “革命报”报道说，有四百八十箱武器和弹药已经在洪都拉斯科特斯港卸货，运到洪都拉斯首都特古西加尔巴，交给了在那里的一个外国军事使团。

    古巴保卫和平和主权运动执行委员会28日发表声明说，帝国主义利益集团利用最荒谬的各种借口顽固地企图挑起对古巴的武装侵略，这将是对世界和平的侵犯。声明警告说，全世界各个角落爱好和平的人士都将起来反对战争。
