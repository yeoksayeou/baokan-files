(Our newspaper, Jinan, 13th dispatch) The No. 1 Coking Plant in Teng County, Shandong Province, has successfully used the "leftovers" from coking coal washing—coal slurry and water slag—for mixed dry distillation to extract coal tar and produce semi-coke. This opens up a new way to fully utilize coal resources and increase the production of petroleum products.

The raw coal used for coking must be washed with water. About 30% of "leftovers" such as coal slurry and water slag can be washed out of one ton of raw coal. Because coal slurry is extremely fine coal powder and sandy mud, it can be burned and has an oil content of about 9%. Because of its strong cohesiveness, it is not easy to dry distill. Water slag contains less coal, has poor cohesiveness, and has an oil content of less than 5%. Therefore, the leftovers of many coking plants and washing plants have not been well utilized in the past. In addition to some coal slurry being used as civilian fuel, water slag and the like are piled up like mountains and regarded as waste. After carefully studying the characteristics of coal slurry and water slag, the No. 1 Coking Plant in Teng County creatively mixed the two, used a simple method to press them into ingots, and then performed low-temperature dry distillation. As a result, thirty to sixty kilograms of coal tar were obtained from each ton of coal slurry and water slag.

With the high-speed development of the iron and steel industry, the demand for coke is increasing day by day, and the amount of coal slurry and water slag is also increasing day by day. Fully utilizing coal slurry and water slag has become an important task. Taking the Teng County No. 1 Coking Plant's production of 350,000 tons of coke this year as an example, about 100,000 tons of coal slurry and water slag can be utilized. After dry distillation, more than 4,000 tons of coal tar can be extracted. From the coal tar, not only can diesel fuel be fractionated for 600 tractors to use for one year, but also various chemical raw materials such as phenols can be obtained. The coal slurry and water slag after dry distillation become semi-coke, which can be used as industrial fuel for calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer, flue-cured tobacco, etc., or as civilian fuel. Because the raw coal is fully utilized, the cost of each ton of coke can be reduced by more than two yuan. (Attached picture)

The heat-collecting dry distillation furnace created by the Lanzhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Petroleum Research Institute has been built and put into production at the No. 1 Coking Plant in Teng County, Shandong Province. This is this type of dry distillation furnace processing coal.

    滕县用洗煤“下脚”炼焦油
    每吨煤泥、水渣出焦油三十公斤到六十公斤
    本报济南13日电　山东滕县第一焦化厂利用炼焦洗煤的“下脚”——煤泥、水渣进行混合干馏提取焦油、生产半焦获得成功，为充分利用煤炭资源，增产石油产品开辟了新的门路。
    炼焦所用的原煤都要经过水洗，一吨原煤可洗出煤泥和水渣等“下脚”约30％。由于煤泥是极细的煤末和砂泥，可以燃烧，含油率达9％左右，由于粘结性很强，不易干馏；水渣含煤较少，粘结性较差，含油率5％以下；因此，许多炼焦厂、洗选厂的下脚，过去都没有能够得到很好的利用，除一部分煤泥作民用燃料外，水渣等都堆积如山，当做废物。滕县第一焦化厂在仔细研究了煤泥和水渣的特点后，创造性地把两者混合起来，采用简易方法压锭后进行低温干馏，结果，每吨煤泥、水渣得到焦油三十至六十公斤。
    随着钢铁工业高速度的发展，焦炭需要量日益增加，煤泥和水渣的数量就日渐增多。充分利用煤泥和水渣就成为一项重要任务了。以滕县第一焦化厂今年生产三十五万吨焦炭计算，可利用的煤泥和水渣约十万吨。进行干馏后，能提取四千多吨焦油。从焦油中不但能分馏出可供六百台拖拉机使用一年的柴油，还可得到酚类等多种化工原料。干馏后的煤泥、水渣成为半焦，可作钙镁磷肥、烤烟等工业燃料或民用燃料。由于原煤得到了充分利用，每吨焦炭可以降低成本二元多。（附图片）
    中国科学院兰州分院石油研究分所创造的集热式干馏炉，已在山东滕县第一焦化厂建成，并开始生产。这是这种干馏炉在处理煤炭。
