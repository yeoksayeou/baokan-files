Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 29th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 28th entitled "The Friendship between Indonesia and China," welcoming the exchange of instruments of ratification of the treaty on dual nationality between Indonesia and the People's Republic of China and the establishment of a joint committee.

The editorial pointed out that, like a morning breeze, it not only brought some fresh air into the relationship between Indonesia and China, but also proved that although the imperialists are viciously trying to undermine the unity between the Asian people, this unity is unbreakable.

The editorial said that if some people or groups still make accusations and slanders, as some reactionary adventurers like Sutomo are doing in the current situation, this is intolerable because it will only create dark clouds again. The editorial concluded by saying that strengthening the friendly relations between Indonesia and China is strengthening Asian-African solidarity and realizing the Bandung spirit.

The Indonesian "Republic" newspaper, in its editorial on the 27th, welcomed the start of the implementation of the treaty on dual nationality. It said that Indonesia had approved and implemented this treaty after a tortuous and lengthy period of five years. Therefore, this newspaper hopes that there will be no delays in the implementation of this treaty.

    印度尼西亚报纸欢迎双重国籍问题条约生效
    中国和印度尼西亚友谊破坏不了
    新华社雅加达29日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”28日发表题为“印度尼西亚和中国的友谊”的社论，欢迎印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国互换关于双重国籍问题的条约的批准书和成立联合委员会。
    社论指出，就像晨风一样，它不仅在印度尼西亚和中国的关系中吹来了一些新鲜空气，同时还证明：尽管帝国主义者恶毒地极力企图破坏亚洲人民之间的团结，但是这种团结是牢不可破的。
    社论说，如果有些人或有些集团仍然提出指责和进行诽谤，像苏托莫这样一些反动的冒险分子在目前情况下所做的那样，这是不能容忍的，因为这只会再一次造成乌云。社论最后说，加强印度尼西亚和中国的友好关系就是加强亚非团结，也是实现万隆精神。
    印度尼西亚“共和国报”在27日的社论中对于开始执行双重国籍问题的条约表示欢迎。它说，印度尼西亚经过了曲折的五年的长时间之后才批准和执行这项条约。因此，这家报纸希望在执行这项条约的过程中不会有迟缓现象。
