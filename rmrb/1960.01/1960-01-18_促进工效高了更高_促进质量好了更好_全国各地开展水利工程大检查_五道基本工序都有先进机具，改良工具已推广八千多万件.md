Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch: In order to ensure that winter water conservancy work passes the seven key hurdles of cold protection, safety, quality, project coordination, etc., the first nationwide inspection of water conservancy projects has begun across the country. Inspection organizations at all levels in various provinces, special zones, counties, and people's communes have mostly gone deep into construction sites to carry out mass inspections of construction conditions and project quality. The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power and relevant departments have also sent people to participate in the inspection teams of various provinces.

This water conservancy project inspection is led by party committees at all levels and organized by various forces, combining top-down and bottom-up approaches. Provinces such as Henan, Shandong, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Gansu began inspections in December last year. Provinces and regions such as Hebei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Heilongjiang also organized inspection teams in early January this year to carry out inspection activities. The Hebei provincial-level inspection team, composed of personnel from relevant departments and led by the provincial party secretary and vice governor, is now inspecting large-scale water conservancy projects and the Miyun Reservoir throughout the province. The Gansu provincial-level inspection team, led by provincial party committee members and the governor, is conducting inspections at construction sites such as the Yin Tao Project. The Anhui provincial-level inspection team is divided into six inspection groups for reservoirs, pumping stations, etc., and also organizes an inspection group to inspect small-scale projects in "dead corner" areas (i.e., areas with few water conservancy projects in the past). In addition to the provincial-level inspection team, inspection organizations in various special zones, counties, and people's communes have also begun large-scale inspections of medium and small-sized projects. Workers and laborers at large-scale project construction sites have also organized their own inspection teams to carry out their own inspections. For this inspection, all localities have proposed to ensure that: every reservoir is visited, every item is inspected, and inspections are thorough, deep, and complete.

The content of this water conservancy project inspection mainly includes seven aspects: checking plans, checking work efficiency, checking designs, checking quality, checking benefits, checking safety, and checking living conditions; summarizing and exchanging experiences; and identifying problems and helping to solve them. Many inspection teams also offer condolences to the vast number of workers and laborers involved in water conservancy construction. Various regions also have different focuses for inspection. For example, Hebei Province's inspection mainly focuses on large and medium-sized reservoirs, while also conducting a general inspection of irrigation, flood control, soil and water conservation, and small reservoirs. Heilongjiang Province focuses on conducting a general survey of projects that will benefit in 1960 and those that will pass flood control barriers. Guangdong Province, located in the south, has an earlier flood season and must complete water conservancy tasks in advance. In addition to conducting the seven checks, this province also focuses on checking progress, safety and quality, and self-reliance.

The 10,000-person inspection organized by the Shangluo Special Zone in Shaanxi Province conducted a strict acceptance of completed projects, issued acceptance certificates for those that passed the acceptance, uniformly numbered the completed projects, determined the special management personnel for each project, and established project management archives at all levels. The Hubei Province inspection team, during the inspection, made detailed written appraisals of the projects together with the construction units and assisted the construction units in formulating construction measures.

This inspection has greatly promoted the winter water conservancy movement. Wherever the inspection team goes, the workers greet the inspection team with greater enthusiasm and higher work efficiency, and work efficiency and quality have improved significantly compared to before. Guangsi County in Guangdong Province found that six of the 69 completed projects did not meet quality requirements during the inspection, and immediately organized 2,500 people to rush to make repairs. Defeng County also found that 52 projects did not meet quality requirements, and immediately organized more than 30,000 people to rush repairs. The water conservancy projects in Hubei Province, after acceptance, proved that the general quality was good, and the quality of the dam body was slightly worse in a few construction sites due to excessive rain and snow and excessive water content of the soil, and remedial measures are being taken after inspection.

Many inspection teams attach great importance to arranging the lives of the workers. Guizhou Province is preparing to summarize some of the good experiences in managing the lives of workers through this inspection and promote them at various construction sites to ensure that all workers can eat well, live well, and rest well.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 17th Dispatch: Our reporter learned from the National Water Conservancy Construction Advanced Tool Evaluation and Selection Site Conference recently held in Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province that the tool reform and technological innovation movement in winter water conservancy construction across the country has achieved great success. Most water conservancy construction sites have initially realized the mechanization of transporting soil with carts, the blasting of soil extraction, the compaction of rolling, and the funneling of loading and unloading. The construction of many large and medium-sized water conservancy projects has achieved mechanization or semi-mechanization.

The five procedures of digging, loading, transporting, unloading, and compacting in water conservancy construction are basic procedures. In winter water conservancy construction, all regions have launched a mass tool reform and technological innovation movement around these five procedures. Now, there are relatively mature advanced construction machinery and methods for these five procedures. In terms of digging soil, in addition to using soil loosening blasting, directional blasting, and abandoning blasting methods to extract soil, the reforms and inventions in digging tools are even more diverse and beautiful. Nantung Special Zone in Jiangsu Province, inspired by the impact of the Yangtze River waves on the embankment, successfully created a hydraulic excavator. This excavator is driven by power machinery and can complete the three procedures of digging, transporting, and compaction at one time. This excavator only requires five people to operate, and the average work efficiency per hour reaches 18 cubic meters. The soil-splitting machinery made in Anhui and Liaoning, which is suitable for cutting ridges and opening mountains and digging frozen soil in hilly and loess plateau areas, also has the advantages of simple structure, convenient use, and high work efficiency. Loading soil is the second procedure in construction. The "Automatic Relay Upward Loading and Unloading Soil Transporter" created in Anhui Province can not only overcome the difficulty of transporting soil uphill, but also solve the problem of loading and unloading during intermediate transportation. This double-axle automatic loading and automatic unloading, loading and unloading connected wooden machinery can transport 43 cubic meters of soil per day with four people operating it within a distance of 120 meters. The high dam soil transporting winch manufactured by Ziyunshan Reservoir in Jiangxi Province is the best of all soil transporting machinery in various places. This soil transporting machine is 110 meters long, has 360 soil loading buckets, and transports more than 1,000 cubic meters of soil per day, which is 146 times more efficient than manual soil transporting to the dam. Compaction is the final procedure in construction. The Yuejin rammer manufactured in Henan Province, which can automatically hit and walk, advance at a fixed distance, hit the front and roll the back, land smoothly, and compact evenly, is equivalent to four old stone rammers. The method of building dams by dumping soil into the water, which is comprehensively promoted in Guangdong Province, is a major technological innovation. Using this method to build dams can save a lot of manual labor by eliminating the need for rolling.

Northern regions have also reformed drilling tools and tools for drilling blastholes in stone projects and screening and washing sand and gravel in concrete projects. Rocket-type, satellite-type, and power-driven drilling machines manufactured in Henan, Liaoning, Hebei, and other provinces are all successful advanced drilling tools. The drilling machine created by Mixian County in Henan Province can drill both obliquely and straight. This machine, which is specially used for drilling blastholes, can drill three meters deep per hour. The hydraulic automatic screening and washing stone machine in Shaanxi Province can automatically screen and wash pebbles of different sizes, which is five times more efficient than manual stone washing.

In the tool reform and technological innovation movement at water conservancy construction sites, all regions adhere to putting politics in command and strengthening ideological leadership. Experience shows that breaking conservative thinking and boosting revolutionary enthusiasm are the keys to doing a good job in tool reform and technological innovation. An effective method for many water conservancy construction sites to break conservative thinking is: "If you don't believe it, just look (organize visits to advanced construction sites), if you don't understand, just calculate (calculate the detailed account of tool reform), if you don't understand, just debate (mobilize the masses to speak out and debate)." After a new type of tool is successfully manufactured, it is also necessary to criticize complacency and further improve it in order to exert greater effectiveness. When the Ziyunshan Reservoir in Jiangxi Province initially made the high dam soil transporting winch, some people were satisfied and thought it had reached the top, but the reservoir party committee, which is good at guiding tool reform with the idea of continuous revolution, further liberated the thinking of employees and repeatedly reformed the wheels and related accessories. As a result, each reform improved the work efficiency, and the soil transporting efficiency jumped from the original 240 cubic meters to 390 cubic meters, 500 cubic meters, and recently reached more than 1,000 cubic meters.

Because water conservancy construction sites in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country attach importance to tool reform and technological innovation in winter construction, so far, more than 80 million improved construction tools have been promoted in various places. According to the number of workers in the country, there is an average of more than one piece per person. Due to the advanced tools, work efficiency has been greatly improved, saving labor and reducing the labor intensity of the workers. At present, the average work efficiency of water conservancy construction sites across the country has increased from 1.5 cubic meters at the beginning of the winter construction last year to more than 4 cubic meters, among which the average work efficiency of the whole province in Henan and Anhui provinces has exceeded 10 cubic meters. Water conservancy construction sites that have achieved mechanized, semi-mechanized, and earth mechanized construction have higher work efficiency.

Now the tool reform and technological innovation movement at water conservancy construction sites across the country is continuing to develop. Many workers at water conservancy construction sites have responded to the initiative of sixteen advanced construction units of water conservancy projects such as Ziyunshan Reservoir in Jiangxi Province and Yin Tao Project in Gansu Province, and are moving towards the direction of realizing semi-mechanization and gradually realizing mechanized construction.

    促进工效高了更高　促进质量好了更好
    全国各地开展水利工程大检查
    五道基本工序都有先进机具，改良工具已推广八千多万件
    新华社17日讯　为了保证冬修水利工作过好防寒、安全、质量、工程配套等七关，全国第一次水利工程大检查已经在各地普遍开始。各省、专区、县和人民公社的各级检查组织，大多数已深入工地，对施工情况和工程质量等展开了群众性的大检查。水利电力部和有关部门也派人参加了各省的检查团。
    这次水利工程大检查，是由各地各级党委挂帅，组织各方力量，自上而下和自下而上结合进行的。河南、山东、湖南、湖北、陕西、甘肃等省，在去年12月间就开始检查。河北、江西、广东、广西、云南、黑龙江等省区在今年1月初也相继组织好检查团，展开了检查活动，河北省省级由各有关部门人员参加的检查团，由省委书记和副省长分别率领，现在检查全省的大型水利工程和密云水库。甘肃省的省级检查团由省委委员和省长带队，正在引洮工程等工地进行检查。安徽省省级检查团分成水库、抽水站等六个检查组活动，同时还组织一个检查“死角”地区（即过去兴修水利工程少的地区）小型工程的检查组。除省级检查团外，各地专区、县、人民公社的检查组织对中、小工程的大检查也已行动起来。大型工程工地的职工和民工也组织了自己检查的队伍，展开自己检查的活动。对于这次大检查，各地都提出要做到：库库到，项项查，查全、查深和查透。
    这次水利工程大检查的内容，主要是查计划、查工效、查设计、查质量、查效益、查安全、查生活等七个方面，总结和交流经验，发现问题并帮助解决问题。许多检查团还对兴修水利的广大职工和民工进行慰问。各地检查也有不同的重点。如河北省这次检查主要以大中型水库为重点，同时对灌溉、除涝、水土保持、小水库等进行普遍大检查。黑龙江省着重对1960年受益和要过拦洪关的工程进行普查。广东省因地处南方，汛期较早，要提前完成水利任务。这个省除进行七查外，还着重查进度、查安全质量、查自力更生。
    陕西省商?专区组织的万人大检查，对已经完成的工程作了严格的验收，对验收合格的发了验收证书，并且对已完工工程作了统一编号，确定每一工程的专管人员，层层建立了工程管理档案。湖北省的检查团在检查中和施工单位一起对工程作了详细的书面鉴定，协助施工单位制订了施工措施。
    这次检查对水利冬修运动起了很大的促进作用。检查团所到之处，民工都以更大的干劲和更高的工效来迎接检查团，工效和质量较前有显著提高。广东省广四县在检查中发现已完成的六十九处工程中，有六处不合质量要求，便立即组织了二千五百人突击补救。德封县也检查出五十二处工程不合质量要求，立即就组织了三万多人抢修。湖北的水利工程经过验收证明，一般质量良好，少数工地因雨雪过多、土料含水量过大等原因，坝身质量稍差，检查后也正采取措施补救。
    许多检查团对安排民工生活都很重视，贵州省准备通过这次检查，总结一些民工生活搞得好的经验，在各工地上推广，以保证全体民工都能吃得好，住得好，休息得好。
    新华社南昌17日电　本社记者从最近在江西广丰县举行的全国水利施工先进工具评比选型现场会议上获悉：全国各地水利冬修中的工具改革和技术革新运动获得了巨大成就，多数水利工地初步实现了运土车子化、取土爆破化、夯实碾压化和装卸漏斗化，有很多处大中型水利工程的施工，实现了机械化或半机械化。
    水利施工中的挖、装、运、卸、压五道工序是基本工序。各地在水利冬修中，围绕着这五道工序展开了群众性的工具改革和技术革新运动。现在，这五道工序都有了比较成熟的先进施工机具和方法。在挖土方面，各地除采用松土爆破、定向爆破和扬弃爆破等方法取土以外，在挖土工具上的改革和发明创造，更是百花齐放，美不胜收。江苏南通专区受长江波涛冲击堤岸的启发，创制成功了水力挖土机，这种挖土机使用动力机械带动，一次就能完成挖、运、压三道工序的任务。这种挖土机只需五人操作，每小时平均工效达到十八方。安徽、辽宁制成的适用于丘陵、黄土高原地区切岭开山和挖冻土的劈土机具，也都具有构造简单、使用方便和工效高的优点。装土是施工中第二道工序。安徽省创制的“自动接力上坡装卸运土器”，既能克服运土爬坡困难，又解决了中途转运的装卸问题。这部双轴式自动装自动卸、装卸衔接的木制机具，在一百二十米的远距离内，四人操作，每天能运土四十三方。江西紫云山水库制造的高坝运土卷扬机，是目前各地所有运土机具中最好的一种，这种运土机长一百一十米，带有装土斗三百六十个，每天运土量达到一千多方，比人工运土上坝提高工效一百四十六倍。压实是施工中最后一道工序。河南省制造的能够自打自走、定距前进、前打后碾、落地平稳、夯实均匀的跃进夯，一部能抵四部旧石夯使用。广东省全面推广的水中倒土的筑坝方法，是一项重大的技术革新，采用这种方法筑坝，可以不用碾压，可以节省大量人工。
    北方各地对打井工具和石方工程中的打炮眼，混凝土工程中的筛洗砂石等工具，也进行了改革。河南、辽宁、河北等省制造的火箭式、卫星式和动力凿井机，都是成功的先进打井工具。河南省密县创造的打眼机，既能斜打也能直打。这部专用于打炮眼用的机具，每小时能打炮眼三米深。陕西省的水力自动分筛洗石器，能自动地分筛和冲洗大小不同的卵石，比人工洗石工效提高五倍。
    各地水利工地在工具改革和技术革新运动中，都坚持政治挂帅，加强思想领导。经验表明，大破保守思想，大鼓革命干劲是搞好工具改革和技术革新的关键。很多水利工地打破保守思想的有效方法是：“不信就看（组织到先进工地参观），不明就算（算工具改革的细账），不通就辩（发动群众鸣放、辩论）”。一种新式工具，制造成功以后，还要批判自满思想，进一步改进，以便发挥更大的效能。江西紫云山水库初制高坝运土卷扬机成功时，有些人满足了，认为到了顶了，可是善于用不断革命思想指导工具改革的水库党委，进一步解放职工思想，并多次改革车轮和有关配件，结果改革一次工效就提高一次，运土效能由原来的二百四十方跃到三百九十方、五百方，最近达到一千多方。
    由于全国各个省、市和自治区的水利工地在冬修中重视工具改革和技术革新，到目前止各地共推广了改良施工工具八千多万件，按全国上工人数计算，平均每人有一件多。由于工具先进，大大提高了工效，节省了人工和减轻了民工的劳动强度。目前，全国水利工地的平均工效已经由去年冬季刚开工时的一点五方提高到四方以上，其中河南、安徽两省的全省平均工效已超过十方。已经实现了机械化、半机械化和土机械化施工的水利工地，工效更高。
    现在全国各水利工地的工具改革和技术革新运动正在继续向前发展。很多水利工地的民工，响应了江西紫云山水库、甘肃引洮工程等十六个水利工程先进施工单位的倡议，正在向实现半机械化和逐步实现机械化施工的方向前进。（附图片）
