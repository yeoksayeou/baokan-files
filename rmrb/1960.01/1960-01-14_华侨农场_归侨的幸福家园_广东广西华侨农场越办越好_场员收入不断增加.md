Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th - Overseas Chinese farms in various parts of Guangdong Province are getting better and better, becoming happy homes for more than 10,000 returned overseas Chinese.

Guangdong Province now has seventeen overseas Chinese farms, with a total of more than 500,000 mu of land, of which more than 60,000 mu have been reclaimed. Among them, four are state-owned farms, namely Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm on Hainan Island, Huaxian Overseas Chinese Farm, Lufeng Overseas Chinese Farm, and Yingde Overseas Chinese Farm. Guangdong Overseas Chinese Investment Company has opened a Baoting Overseas Chinese Farm on Hainan Island. The other twelve farms are cooperatively run by overseas Chinese. These farms have developed greatly in recent years. The tropical and subtropical crops such as rubber, coffee, sisal hemp, oil palm, lemongrass, pineapple, and lychee planted on the four state-owned farms have mostly been harvested. The coffee bean output of Xinglong Farm in the first four months of 1959 was equal to half of the total output of 1958. The Lufeng Farm, with 1,000 members, has achieved self-sufficiency in six essential items—grain, cooking oil, pork, fresh fish, vegetables, and sugar—since 1958. The industrial development of various farms is also rapid. Xinglong Farm has built more than ten factories, including a lemongrass processing plant, a chemical plant, a machine factory, a building materials factory, a farm tool manufacturing plant, and an automobile repair plant.

With the rapid development of farm production, the economic income of returned overseas Chinese farm members has increased year by year, and their living standards have continuously improved. The average monthly salary of farm members in Xinglong Farm is now three times higher than in 1952, and almost every household has savings. Xiao Ying, a returned overseas Chinese from Malaya, was forced to sell her four-year-old daughter due to hardship abroad. Now her family of nine is doing well with the adults working on the farm, and the children attending school. Xiao Ying is also the captain of the lemongrass production team. Because of her active work, she has been rated as a model worker several times and was also selected as a representative to attend the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Conference. Various farms have also established public canteens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, schools, and hospitals, and built many dormitories. Xinglong, Huaxian, and other farms also have film projection teams and cultural troupes.

Currently, various farms are preparing to receive a large number of returned overseas Chinese. For example, Xinglong Farm plans to reclaim another 40,000 mu of wasteland in 1960 and is preparing to build 30,000 square meters of housing, including factories, theaters, cultural palaces, and dormitories for newly returned overseas Chinese. It will also establish a secondary technical school to train overseas Chinese children.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 13th - Guangxi State-owned Overseas Chinese Farm has achieved great development in production in the past year. Last year, the farm's income reached more than 230,000 yuan, an increase of eleven and a half times compared to 1958, becoming a larger farm in Guangxi that manages subtropical economic crops.

The Overseas Chinese Farm is located near Luowei in Wuming County and has more than 15,000 mu of land. More than half of the farm's 800 employees are returned overseas Chinese and their families from Malaya, Thailand, Indonesia, and other places. Together with local workers, they have newly opened more than 5,000 mu of land, planting more than 20 kinds of subtropical economic crops and other crops such as clove basil and lemongrass. Due to their careful care, the lemongrass and maple grass planted in April and May last year have already been harvested, with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu; more than 100 mu of clove basil has also achieved a bumper harvest. The farm has also established a local incense factory, a maple grass oil factory, and a paper mill.

The Guangxi Overseas Chinese Farm has received strong support from the Party and the government. In the early days of the farm's establishment, there was a shortage of funds. The state successively invested more than 214,000 yuan, allocated three tractors and large tracts of land to the farm, and helped the farm solve the labor problem. The returned overseas Chinese and their families participating in the farm are very enthusiastic about production. The average salary of the farm this year has increased by 20% compared to last year. The farm has also opened schools for overseas Chinese children, so that all school-age children can attend school; at the same time, free medical care is implemented.

The farm also plans to expand the planting area this year, build a new hydroelectric power station, and expand and build a number of employee dormitories, canteens, and schools.

    华侨农场——归侨的幸福家园
    广东广西华侨农场越办越好　场员收入不断增加
    新华社广州13日电　广东省各地华侨农场越办越好，成为一万多名归国华侨的幸福家园。
    广东省现在有十七个华侨农场，共拥有土地五十多万亩，已开垦的有六万多亩。其中有四个是国营农场，即海南岛兴隆华侨农场、花县华侨农场、陆丰华侨农场、英德华侨农场。广东省华侨投资公司在海南岛开办了一个保亭华侨农场。另外十二个农场是由华侨合作经营的。这些农场几年来有了很大发展。四个国营农场种植的橡胶、咖啡、剑麻、油棕、香茅、菠萝、荔枝等热带、亚热带作物，大都已有收获。兴隆农场1959年头四个月咖啡豆的产量就等于1958年全年产量的一半。有一千名场员的陆丰农场，从1958年起就做到了粮食、食油、猪肉、鲜鱼、蔬菜、食糖等六项生活必需品自给。各个农场的工业发展也很快，兴隆农场已建有香茅加工厂、化工厂、机械厂、建筑材料厂、农具制造厂和汽车修理厂等十多个工厂。
    随着农场生产的飞跃发展，归侨场员的经济收入逐年增加，生活不断改善。兴隆农场场员们目前每月的平均工资，比1952年增加了三倍，几乎家家户户都有存款。马来亚归侨萧英，在国外时被生活所迫出卖了四岁的女儿，现在她一家九口，大人在农场劳动，孩子们念书，生活很好。萧英还当了香茅生产队队长，因为工作积极曾几次被评为模范，还被选为出席全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子大会的代表。各个农场还设立了公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院、学校和医院，修建了许多宿舍。兴隆、花县等农场还有电影队、文工团。
    现在，各个农场正在为接受大批归侨进行准备。如兴隆农场1960年计划再开垦荒地四万亩，并准备兴建三万平方米房舍，其中包括工厂、戏院、文化宫和给新归侨居住的宿舍，并将建立一所中等技术学校，培养华侨子弟。
    据新华社南宁13日电　广西国营华侨农场在过去一年中生产获得很大发展。去年农场收入达二十三万多元，比1958年增加十一倍半，成为广西较大的经营亚热带经济作物农场。
    华侨农场在武鸣县锣圩附近，有一万五千多亩土地。全场八百多名职工中一半以上是马来亚、泰国、印度尼西亚等地的归国侨胞和侨眷。他们同当地工人一起新开了五千多亩土地，种植了丁香罗勒、香茅等二十多种亚热带经济作物和其他作物。由于他们精心护理，去年4、5月刚分植的香茅、枫茅已经收割，亩产千斤以上；一百多亩丁香罗勒也得到丰收。农场还建立了土香厂、枫茅油厂和造纸厂等。
    广西华侨农场得到了党和政府的大力支持。农场成立初期，资金不足，国家先后投资二十一万四千多元，拨给农场三台拖拉机和大片土地，并帮助农场解决了劳动力问题。参加农场的归国侨胞和侨眷生产积极性都很高。农场今年平均工资比去年增加了20％，场里还为华侨子弟开办了学校，使适龄儿童能够全部上学；同时实行了公费医疗。
    农场今年还准备扩大种植面积，新建一座水电站，扩建和新建一批职工宿舍、食堂和学校等。
