Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 20th: U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi issued a joint communiqué on the 19th, emphasizing the strengthening of military cooperation between Japan and the United States in expanding and committing aggression in Asia.

    Nobusuke Kishi held secret talks with Eisenhower, Herter, and other U.S. government leaders during his trip to Washington to sign the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

    The joint communiqué stated that the talks between Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke on the 19th, prior to the signing of the new "Security Treaty," "comprehensively and fully examined current international developments and U.S.-Japan relations." The communiqué continued to promote the policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, saying that they expressed their belief that, in this period, "it is extremely important for free nations to maintain their determination, unity, and strength by all means."

    Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke stated in the communiqué that the new U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty "strengthens the collaboration and cooperation between the two countries." The two countries will "continue to cooperate closely" within the scope of the new treaty. Because the Japanese public is concerned that the United States will use the new treaty to drag Japan into aggressive wars launched by the United States, the communiqué specifically stated that Eisenhower "assured" Kishi Nobusuke: "Regarding issues involving prior consultations under this treaty, the United States has no intention of taking actions in a way that violates the wishes of the Japanese government." The communiqué described this new treaty as "greatly strengthening peace and security in the Far East" and "promoting" the so-called "free cause" throughout the world. The communiqué revealed that after the United States and Japan form a military alliance, they will further collude to commit aggression in Asia. Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke declared in the joint communiqué that they would "maintain close contact and consultation" on "the development of the Asian region." "They agreed that Japan's increasing international discussion of Asian issues is in the interests of the free world."

    It can be seen from the communiqué that the U.S. and Japanese government leaders reached a political deal in the talks on the United States supporting Japan's economic expansion into Southeast Asia and Japan easing restrictions on U.S. goods. The communiqué stated that Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke emphasized the so-called "increasing role that the industrialized countries of the free world must play in helping the progress of less developed regions." The communiqué said: "The President (of the United States) specifically mentioned the increasing role of the Japanese people in the economic development of free Asia." Regarding the economic relations between the U.S. and Japan, the communiqué stated that both sides should avoid "unnecessary trade restrictions and continue to expand world trade in an orderly manner through positive measures to remove existing barriers."

    Kishi Nobusuke's remarks at a press conference on the evening of the 19th further exposed some of the details of his talks with Eisenhower.

    Kishi Nobusuke said that the impression he got from Eisenhower was: "Eisenhower's view of the international situation is not the same as the 'thaw' that people in Japan imagine." According to Eisenhower, "there are still many difficult problems to be solved in resolving the outstanding issues between East and West."

    Kishi Nobusuke revealed that he and Eisenhower discussed the China issue. He said that the Japanese government has "a strong interest" in China. He and Eisenhower agreed that they "should cooperate and consult closely with each other" on Asian regional issues, including the China issue.

    At the press conference, Kishi Nobusuke begged the United States to support Japan's economic expansion into Asia. He said that Japan's economic strength is limited, and it is impossible for Japan to carry out "economic cooperation" in Asia alone. "If free countries, especially the United States, can strengthen cooperation, we will certainly do our best to provide economic and technical assistance for the development work of these (Asian) countries."

    In his talks with Eisenhower, Kishi Nobusuke not only agreed to relax import restrictions on U.S. goods, but also expressed to the United States that he would control the export of Japanese goods to the United States.

    Kishi Nobusuke said that he had explained to Eisenhower that "Japan will do its best to ensure that its exports to the United States can be sold in an orderly manner."

    Kishi Nobusuke was afraid that the Japanese public would accuse him of not obtaining a firm guarantee from the United States on the so-called "prior consultation" issue, so he jokingly said that regarding the "prior consultation" issue, it is "meaningless" to require that the deployment and equipment of U.S. troops stationed in Japan be subject to major changes and that Japan's consent and veto power be obtained when taking military actions.

### 艾森豪威尔和岸信介发表会谈公报  日美两国加紧勾结扩军备战

    艾森豪威尔和岸信介发表会谈公报
    日美两国加紧勾结扩军备战
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔和日本首相岸信介19日发表联合公报，强调日美两国在亚洲进行扩张和侵略方面加强军事合作。
    岸信介这次在到华盛顿签订日美军事同盟条约的同时，和艾森豪威尔、赫脱等美国政府首脑举行了秘密会谈。
    联合公报说，艾森豪威尔和岸信介19日在签订新“安全条约”以前举行的会谈，“广泛地和全面地研究了目前的国际事态发展以及日美关系”。公报继续宣传扩军备战政策说，他们表示相信，在这个时期中，“自由国家用一切方法保持它们的决心、团结和力量是非常重要的”。
    艾森豪威尔和岸信介在公报中说，新的日美军事同盟条约“加强了两国之间的协作和合作”。两国将在新条约的范围内“继续进行密切合作”。由于日本公众担心美国将利用新条约把日本牵入美国发动的侵略战争中去，公报特地说，艾森豪威尔向岸信介“保证”：“在关于牵涉到根据这个条约事先协商的问题方面，美国无意以一种违反日本政府的意愿的方式采取行动”。公报把这个新条约说成是将“大大加强远东的和平和安全”，并且“促进”全世界的所谓“自由事业”。公报透露，在美国和日本结成军事同盟以后，它们将进一步勾结侵略亚洲。艾森豪威尔和岸信介在联合公报中宣称，他们要在“亚洲地区的发展方面”“保持密切的接触和磋商”。“他们一致认为，日本越来越多地关于亚洲问题的国际讨论是符合自由世界的利益的。”
    从公报中可以看出，美日两国政府首脑在会谈中就美国支持日本向东南亚进行经济扩张和日本放宽对美国商品的限制作了一笔政治交易。公报说，艾森豪威尔和岸信介强调所谓“自由世界的工业化国家在帮助比较不发达地区的进步方面必须起的愈来愈大的作用”。公报说：“（美国）总统特别提到日本人民在自由亚洲的经济发展方面日益增强的作用”。至于美日两国的经济关系，公报说，双方要避免“不必要的贸易限制，通过清除现有障碍的积极措施来继续和有条不紊地扩大世界贸易”。
    岸信介19日晚上在记者招待会上的谈话，进一步暴露了他和艾森豪威尔在会谈中的一些情况。
    岸信介说，他从艾森豪威尔那里得到的印象是：“艾森豪威尔对国际形势的看法并不是像在日本的人民所想像的、比如‘解冻’那样的看法”，据艾森豪威尔说，“要想解决东西方悬案，还有很多困难问题”。
    岸信介透露，他和艾森豪威尔讨论了中国问题。他说，日本政府对中国“兴趣很浓”。他和艾森豪威尔一致认为，他们在包括中国问题在内的亚洲地区问题上“应该互相密切合作和磋商。”
    岸信介在记者招待会上乞求美国支持日本向亚洲的经济扩张。他说，日本的经济力量有一定限度，单靠日本是不可能在亚洲进行“经济合作”的。“如果自由国家、特别是同美国能够加强合作，我们在为这些（亚洲）国家的发展工作提供经济技术援助方面一定尽可能努力”。
    岸信介在同艾森豪威尔的会谈中，不仅同意放宽对美国货的进口限制，并且向美国表示要控制日本货向美国的输出。
    岸信介说，他已经向艾森豪威尔说明，“日本将尽可能努力，使它对美国的出口货能够有秩序地销售。”
    岸信介害怕日本公众指责他在所谓“事先协商”问题上没有取得美国的切实保证，因此自我解嘲地说，关于“事先协商”问题，要求规定驻日美军的部署和装备作重大改变和采取作战行动时需要取得日本的同意和保有否决权一事，“是没有意义的”。
