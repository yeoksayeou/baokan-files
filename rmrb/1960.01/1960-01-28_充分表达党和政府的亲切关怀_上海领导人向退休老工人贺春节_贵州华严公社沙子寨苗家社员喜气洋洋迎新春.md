Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 27th: The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions invited over 300 retired veteran workers to a discussion meeting on the 25th. Chen Pixian, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretariat; Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretariat and Vice Mayor of Shanghai; and Wei Wenbo and Ma Tianshui, Secretaries of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, met with the retired veteran workers and extended their warm Spring Festival greetings to them.

Currently, over 25,000 veteran workers in Shanghai retire and receive pensions according to the Labor Insurance Regulations. The state pays over 14 million yuan in pension funds annually, allowing them to spend their later years happily. At the discussion meeting, the veteran workers repeatedly praised today's happy life and thanked the Party for its meticulous care. These veteran workers suffered the most in the old society and have a particularly deep understanding of today's happiness, and their desire to completely change the poor and blank state of the motherland is also particularly strong. Therefore, although they have retired, their thinking has not, and they continue to actively contribute their strength to implementing the Party's General Line. Many retired veteran workers often use their own experiences to conduct class education for the younger generation, and many have become the backbone of neighborhood work. Some retired veteran workers also often return to the factory to guide young workers in technological innovation.

Zhong Min, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions; Zhang Jingtao, Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee; and Guo Jian, Secretary of the Women's Work Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Director of the Shanghai Women's Federation, all spoke at the discussion meeting. They called the veteran workers the most valuable treasure of the country and praised the retired veteran workers' communist spirit and their valuable contributions to the socialist construction cause.

After the discussion meeting, Shanghai Party and government leaders Chen Pixian, Cao Diqiu, Wei Wenbo, Ma Tianshui, and others had dinner with the retired veteran workers. Chen Pixian poured wine for each of the veteran workers and inquired about their living conditions with concern, encouraging them to continue to carry forward the fine qualities of the working class and inspire and educate the younger generation. The veteran workers sincerely thanked the Party for its concern and expressed their determination to continue to hold high the banner of the General Line and contribute their strength to the high-speed construction of socialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, January 27th, reporter Xu Zhang reports: On the eve of the Spring Festival, I visited Shazizhai in Huayan Commune, on the outskirts of Anshun City, Guizhou Province.

This is a Miao ethnic village. Before even entering the village, the beautiful sounds of the Lusheng could be heard from afar. The festive gongs and drums, firecrackers, and the rising and falling mountain songs added an atmosphere of happiness and joy to this Miao mountain village. At the west end of the village, a large group of Miao youths and girls were rehearsing "Flower Dance" and flower lantern operas, preparing for performances during the Spring Festival. Children were gathered around watching the excitement. In the public canteen, the cooks were busy processing a freshly slaughtered fat pig, preparing to make the traditional Miao reunion dinner for the commune members. Master Chef Zhang Shuqing said with a smile, "This year is truly a good year, with abundant harvests of grains and thriving livestock. Such a fat pig is rare in our village." The commune members were all beaming with joy. Taking advantage of the day off, some were washing clothes and bedding, some were cleaning, others were making *baba* and sweet wine with the glutinous rice distributed by the commune, and many female commune members had gone to the shops to buy New Year's goods.

Huayan Commune had a bumper harvest last year, with grain production increasing by two-thirds compared to 1958, and the total value of industrial and agricultural output increasing by more than double. The income of commune members also increased significantly compared to 1958. The twenty Miao commune members of the Shazizhai production team, after distribution, had an average of more than 150 yuan in savings per household in the bank, with the largest deposit being 300 yuan. With such a joyful festival of a prosperous year, how could people not be happy!

    上海领导人向退休老工人贺春节
    贵州华严公社沙子寨苗家社员喜气洋洋迎新春
    据新华社上海27日电　上海市总工会25日邀请三百多位退休老工人举行座谈会，中共上海市委书记处书记陈丕显，中共上海市委书记处书记、上海市副市长曹荻秋，中共上海市委书记处书记魏文伯、马天水等会见了到会的退休老工人，亲切地向他们祝贺春节。
    上海市现在有两万五千多老工人按照劳动保险条例退休养老，国家每年为他们付出一千四百多万元养老金，使他们幸福地安度晚年。在座谈会上，老工人们一再赞美今天的幸福生活，感谢党的无微不至的关怀。这些老工人在旧社会里吃的苦最多，对今天的幸福体会得特别深刻，彻底改变祖国一穷二白面貌的愿望也特别强烈。因此他们人退休了，思想却没有退休，仍然积极为贯彻党的总路线贡献自己的力量。许多退休老工人经常以自己的亲身经历向青年一代进行阶级教育，许多人成了里弄工作的骨干；有些退休老工人还经常回厂指点青年工人革新技术。
    上海市总工会主席钟民，中共上海市委副秘书长张敬焘，中共上海市委妇女工作委员会书记、上海市妇联主任郭建，都在座谈会上讲了话，他们称老工人们是国家最可贵的珍宝，并且赞扬退休老工人的共产主义精神和对社会主义建设事业所作的可贵贡献。
    座谈会以后，上海市党政领导人陈丕显、曹荻秋、魏文伯、马天水等，同退休老工人一起进晚餐。陈丕显为老工人一一斟酒，并关切地询问了他们的生活情况，鼓励他们继续发扬工人阶级的优良品质，鼓舞和教育青年一代。老工人们衷心感谢党的关怀，表示要继续高举总路线的旗帜，为高速度建设社会主义贡献自己的力量。
    据新华社贵阳27日电　记者徐张报道：春节前夕，记者访问了贵州省安顺市郊华严公社沙子寨。
    这是一个苗族聚居的村寨。还没有进寨，老远就听到优美的籚笙乐声。节日的锣鼓、爆竹和此起彼落的山歌，给这个苗族山村增添了幸福和欢乐的气氛。村子西头，一大群苗家后生和姑娘们正在排练“跳花舞”和花灯剧，准备在春节演出。孩子们围着看热闹。公共食堂里，炊事员正在忙着处理刚宰的一头肥猪，准备给社员做苗族传统的团圆饭。大师傅张树清笑嘻嘻地说：“今年真是个好年成，五谷丰收，六畜兴旺，这样肥的猪在我们寨子上还是少有。”社员们家家户户喜气洋洋，趁这天放假，有的在洗衣服、被子，有的在打扫，也有的在用公社发给的糯米做粑粑、甜酒，还有不少女社员到商店去选购年货去了。
    华严公社去年大丰收，粮食产量比1958年增加三分之二，工农业总产值增加一倍多，社员收入也比1958年大大增加。沙子寨生产小队的二十户苗族社员，在分配以后，平均每户在银行储蓄了一百五十多元，最多的存款三百元。这样丰年的喜庆节日，怎能叫人不高兴呢！
