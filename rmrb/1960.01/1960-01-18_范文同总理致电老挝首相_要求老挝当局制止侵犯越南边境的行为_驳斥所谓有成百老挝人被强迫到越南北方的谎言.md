Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 15th: Pham Van Dong, Premier of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, today replied to a telegram from Kou Abhay, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, refuting the lie that "hundreds of Laotians were forced to northern Vietnam by Vietnamese elements." Laotian Prime Minister Kou Abhay had sent a telegram to Premier Pham Van Dong on January 13 regarding the so-called "hundreds of Laotians being forced to northern Vietnam by Vietnamese elements" incident.

Pham Van Dong pointed out in the telegram: "The aforementioned news is completely unfounded."

The telegram stated that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all neighboring countries. The Vietnamese people, administrative personnel, and military of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam along the Vietnam-Laos border have strictly implemented the aforementioned policy.

The telegram said, "Conversely, I regret to note that the Royal Laotian Army and Royal Laotian Air Force have repeatedly violated the territory and airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, creating tensions in the Vietnam-Laos border region. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly protested to the Royal Laotian Government regarding the aforementioned violations. Most recently, a unit of the Royal Laotian Army invaded the territory of Bien Phat village, Khong Tuong commune, Nghe An province, of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, causing serious loss of life and property to the local Vietnamese people. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent a telegram to the Royal Laotian Government protesting the aforementioned incident on December 9 of last year."

The telegram stated that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently hoped to establish good-neighborly relations with the Kingdom of Laos on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, in accordance with the spirit of mutual respect for the 1954 Geneva Accords on Indochina, and the joint communiqué issued by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Government of the Kingdom of Laos in Hanoi on August 29, 1956.

Pham Van Dong expressed in the telegram his hope that the new government of the Kingdom of Laos would take measures to stop acts of violation of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, promote the improvement of neighborly relations between the two countries, and enable the Vietnamese and Laotian peoples to live peaceful and happy lives.

    范文同总理致电老挝首相
    要求老挝当局制止侵犯越南边境的行为
    驳斥所谓有成百老挝人被强迫到越南北方的谎言
    新华社河内15日电　越南民主共和国政府总理范文同今天复电老挝王国政府首相古·阿派，驳斥所谓有“成百名老挝人被越南分子强迫到越南北方”的谎言。老挝首相古·阿派在1月13日曾就所谓“成百名老挝人被越南分子强迫到越南北方”的事件打电报给范文同总理。
    范文同在电报里指出：“上述消息完全是没有根据的。”
    电报说，越南民主共和国政府一贯尊重各邻国的主权和领土的完整。在越老边界沿线的越南人民、越南民主共和国行政人员和军队已经严格执行上述政策。
    电报说，“与此相反，我感到遗憾的是，老挝王国军队和王国空军曾经多次侵犯越南民主共和国的领土和领空，在越老边界地区制造紧张局势。越南民主共和国政府曾经多次就上述侵犯事件向老挝王国政府提出抗议。最近，老挝王国的一支军队侵犯了越南民主共和国宜安省空都乡边发村的领土，给当地的越南人民造成了严重的性命和财产的损失。越南民主共和国政府曾经在去年12月9日就上述事件打电报给老挝王国政府提出抗议。”
    电报说，越南民主共和国政府一贯希望在和平共处五项原则的基础上，根据双方共同尊重1954年关于印度支那的日内瓦协议的精神和越南民主共和国政府同老挝王国政府1956年8月29日在河内发表的联合公报的精神，同老挝王国建立睦邻关系。
    范文同在电报里希望老挝王国新政府采取措施制止侵犯越南民主共和国领土的行为，促使两国的邻邦关系获得改善，使越南人民和老挝人民能够过和平和幸福的生活。
