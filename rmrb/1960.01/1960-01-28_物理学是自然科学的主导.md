    Physics is the Leader of Natural Science
    Zhou Peiyuan
    Physics currently holds a dominant position in natural science. It has deeply penetrated various departments of natural science and various engineering technologies.
    
    The Relationship Between the Development of Physics and the Development of Production
    Physics is the science that studies the most general forms of motion of space-time and matter, and the basic structure of matter. The generation, growth, and development of physics come from people's production practices. Mechanics is the earliest systematized branch of physics. In China during the Warring States period, Mozi had a preliminary understanding of the concept of force and the principle of levers. Obviously, the discovery of the lever principle was inseparable from the requirements of feudal society's productive forces to reduce labor and improve production efficiency in specific work such as agricultural labor, construction, and transportation. From the lever principle to the most modern atomic energy, thermonuclear reactions, radio, electronics, and semiconductor physics, the development history of physics over more than two thousand years is also a history of mutual promotion and mutual promotion between physics and social production. We can find many examples to illustrate how production practice and observation of natural phenomena in the objective world are abstracted into a complete theoretical system. On the other hand, the discovery and application of physical laws point out new directions for social production and open up new production fields. The close relationship between science and production has particularly rich and vivid examples in the development process of physics. The current peaceful use of atomic energy is one of the most prominent examples.
    
    The relationship between physics and production can be examined from three aspects. First, physics provides the laws of energy conversion for social production and points out the source of energy necessary for social production. Before the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century, the energy supply required for industrial and agricultural production mainly came from mechanical energy, such as mechanical energy related to human, animal, wind, and water power. The invention and widespread use of the steam engine provided a new form of energy, enabling physics workers to discover the law of conservation of energy and realize that thermal energy can be converted into mechanical energy, and mechanical energy can also be converted into thermal energy. The discovery of the objective law that energy cannot be generated or destroyed, but can only be converted into each other, is of fundamental significance for the development of both physics and productive forces. Under the guidance of the idea that energy in nature can only be converted but cannot be generated or destroyed, scientific workers and engineers have also realized that chemical energy and electrical energy can also be converted into mechanical energy. After the discovery of the electromagnetic induction phenomenon and the invention of generators and motors, the mutual conversion of electrical energy and mechanical energy became a reality. The invention of the internal combustion engine opened up the prospect of converting chemical energy stored in hydrocarbon compounds into controllable mechanical energy and being widely used. The tremendous role played by induction generators, motors, and internal combustion engines in industrial and agricultural production is well known to everyone. At the end of the nineteenth century, the discovery of new physical phenomena such as natural radioactivity, electrons, X-rays, and electromagnetic waves caused fundamental changes in the views of physicists on space, time, material movement, and material structure. At the beginning of this century, the publication of the new physical law of the theory of special relativity on the relationship between mass and energy unified the two natural laws of energy conservation and mass conservation in physics and chemistry. After half a century of outstanding creative labor by scientific workers and engineering technicians, the disciplines of atomic physics, nuclear physics, and nuclear chemistry have been greatly developed, and finally, with the cooperation of outstanding Soviet scientific and technical personnel and workers, the world's first atomic power station was built. Since then, the huge amount of atomic energy emitted by the fission of heavy nuclei and according to the mass-energy relation law has been controlled and tamed to serve mankind. The advanced Soviet science and engineering technology community is concentrating its efforts on solving the problem of controlling the energy emitted by the fusion of light nuclei (also based on the mass-energy relation law), which is thousands of times greater than fission. Although it has not been completely successful, it has achieved great success. If fusion energy is once controlled by mankind—its realization will not be in the distant future—then mankind will obtain inexhaustible energy sources from nature. Mastering these energy sources can greatly change the face of human life.
    
    Second, physics can provide the physical properties of materials in the development process of social productive forces, thereby providing the theoretical basis and methods for preparing new materials. Whether it is machinery and other material equipment required for national defense, industry, agriculture, or transportation, component materials are a fundamental issue. From the perspective of engineering technology, the use of materials must meet the conditions of being strong, durable, and economical. The strength of solids is a physical problem that has long been valued by the engineering technology community. On the one hand, the objective mechanical strength properties of materials must be mastered and applied by engineering technicians in machinery, aviation, civil engineering, construction, and transportation in their designs; on the other hand, further theoretical microscopic property research on various materials by physics can open up new prospects for the use of materials. In the past thirty years, due to the rapid development of atomic physics, solid-state physics has also developed accordingly. According to the theoretical calculation results of applying quantum mechanics to solid strength, the strength of solid materials can theoretically be increased by several times, dozens of times, or even hundreds to thousands of times. Needless to say, the significant practical significance of increasing solid strength by dozens or hundreds of times, even increasing it by one time can save a lot of wealth for the country. Fifty million tons of steel will have the benefits equivalent to one hundred million tons of steel. Therefore, the contribution of theoretical research on solid strength to increasing production and practicing economy is immeasurable.
    
    In addition, the continuous development of productive forces puts forward new research topics for physics. We are now in the era of atomic energy, artificial earth satellites, and space rockets. The manufacturing of various alloy materials resistant to high temperature and high pressure has been put on the agenda. The materials used in atomic reactors or engines powered by atomic energy must also consider the properties of resistance to nuclear radiation and corrosion. In recent years, low-temperature physics has made great progress. The superconducting phenomenon of matter at low temperatures has begun to have important applications in engineering technology. Therefore, it is also necessary to explore the various properties of solids under low-temperature conditions. Obviously, the properties of solids under high temperature, high pressure, nuclear radiation, and low temperature are fundamentally different from the properties under normal temperature and pressure conditions.
    
    Third, the continuous development of physics is a source for social productive forces to absorb new technologies and new methods in the development process, and it is also the main source for other scientific departments to adopt new research tools and research methods. The great Lenin once elevated electrification to the height of being a necessary condition for building a communist society, parallel to the Soviet regime. From a physical point of view, the discovery of the electromagnetic induction phenomenon is one of the important physical bases for electrification. Similarly, X-rays, which have penetrating properties to matter, have become important tools for the medical community to check physical health and for engineering materials to detect internal flaws. The development of spectroscopy has enabled the widespread adoption of spectral analysis methods in the metallurgical industry; the name "spectrally pure" has been listed as a new purity standard in the preparation of chemical reagents.
    
    Modern Physics Provides New Tools and New Methods for Economic and Cultural Construction
    Neutrons in atomic nuclei and artificial radioactivity exhibited by atomic nuclei under impact were important discoveries in the physics community in the 1930s. Only after the discovery of neutrons and artificial radioactivity, followed by the discovery of uranium fission, did the prospect of utilizing atomic energy open up. The peaceful use of atomic energy not only provides new and large amounts of energy for industrial and agricultural production, but also provides radioactive isotopes for wide application in industry, agriculture, and medical and health undertakings. The application of radioactive isotopes in industry and agriculture can be divided into two types. One is to irradiate from the outside to the inside with rays, such as using the γ-rays emitted by cobalt-60 to detect the internal damage of mechanical components, and using irradiation to change the properties of materials and promote plant development. The other is to allow radioactive isotopes to be absorbed into the object, and emit rays from the inside to the outside in order to test the internal mechanism of the object. Tracer atoms used in biology are those that emit rays from the inside to the outside. The effect of radioactive isotopes is a big step forward compared to X-rays.
    
    Another very important new method and new tool that modern physics provides for industrial and agricultural production, medical and health care, and scientific research work in other scientific departments is radio, electronics (including solid-state electronics), and semiconductor technology. Radio was invented at the beginning of this century. Its development began after World War I, and it made great progress during World War II. Semiconductor physics and semiconductor technology formed a climax of development after World War II. At present, semiconductor devices have replaced electron tubes in many aspects; even in missiles, artificial earth satellites, and space rockets, semiconductor crystal triodes must be used.
    
    The application of the theory and experimental technology of radio electronics is very extensive. In national defense, transportation, and people's daily lives, the importance of radio and electronics is well known to everyone. They also account for a very large proportion in the cause of the peaceful use of atomic energy. Most of the various types of accelerators are the work of radio and electronics, and radioactivity counters also require experimental technologies such as rectification and amplification of radio and electronics. The invention and continuous innovation of electronic computers have made computational mathematics a very important discipline in national defense and economic construction. The application of radio in observing celestial bodies has produced a new astronomy—radio astronomy. As for the research work of basic sciences such as mechanics, meteorology, chemistry, biology, and geology, the theory and experimental methods of radio and electronics are also used more or less. At present, production automation is a cutting-edge problem in industrial production. Missiles and interstellar navigation require the technology of automatic control and remote control; these are all technologies of radio and electronics. Generally speaking, in the current research work of engineering technology and many scientific disciplines, radio and electronics occupy a very prominent position.
    
    Physics provides many research methods and instruments and equipment for engineering technology and other scientific departments. For example, the electrical and magnetic methods in physics have long been used to explore metal and petroleum deposits; ultrasonics can be used to detect damage to the internal structure of materials; ultraviolet, infrared, and microwave spectra in optics have their own application fields. With the continuous development of physics, it will provide more and better new tools and new methods for other scientific departments.
    
    Obviously, the above-mentioned three aspects of interaction between physics and production are closely related to each other. It is impossible to separate them completely. Originally, the understanding of nature and the transformation of nature are linked to each other. People can transform nature from the understanding of nature; conversely, they can further understand nature in the transformation of nature.
    
    Inheritance and Development of Modern Physics
    The physical laws discovered through production practice can play a positive role in further developing social productive forces and promoting the progress of social material production. On the other hand, physics itself also has its own internal contradictions and development laws, which are manifested in its inheritance, systematicity, and reality. The emergence of the theory of special relativity is because the space-time concept of classical Newtonian mechanics cannot solve the electromagnetic phenomena in moving media; the creation of quantum mechanics is also the atomic structure theory established on the basis of the old space-time understanding, which cannot systematically explain the observed atomic and molecular spectral phenomena. From the history of physics development, the discovery and application of physical laws with fundamental properties often have a wider and deeper impact on production practice. From the publication of the law of mass-energy relation in 1905 to the start of power generation at the world's first atomic power station in the Soviet Union in 1954, physicists carried out a series of basic experimental and theoretical research work that was relatively distant from production practice at the time. Their creative labor led to the fission of uranium nuclei, the establishment of atomic reactors, and the peaceful use of atomic energy. The important role played by basic theoretical research in the development of this part of physics in the more than 50 years since the discovery of electromagnetic waves by radio and electronics is another typical example in physics. Of course, the development of physics itself must also be encouraged and accelerated under the premise of the development of social productive forces. It is unimaginable to build large-scale accelerators in the handicraft era.
    
    Physics is the science of the basic forms of material existence—space and time—and the most general forms of material movement. The motion problems dealt with by physics can generally be divided into the categories of physics according to the size of the space of material movement. The first is basic particle physics, cosmic rays, and nuclear physics. This is the most basic part of physics at present. It penetrates into the deepest core of matter and the smallest space of the material world, and often involves the movement of nucleons with huge energy. Many countries in the world attach great importance to this department of physics, establishing various types and sizes of accelerators and observing cosmic rays at high altitudes. The Soviet Union has the world's largest 10 billion electron volt proton synchronous phase-stable accelerator currently operating smoothly. The data of cosmic rays observed by the Soviet Union using artificial earth satellites and space rockets far away from the Earth's atmosphere greatly enrich our knowledge of the composition of cosmic rays. It can be affirmed that research work in this area will not only lead to major technological innovations, but also produce far-reaching results in academic terms, which will enable us to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of space and time, the movement and structure of matter.
    
    The second is the physics of electromagnetic fields, gases, liquids, and solids based on atomic structure or related to atomic structure and electron movement. This aspect includes many disciplines of physics that were established earlier and have recently gained great development. Among them, radio, electronics, and semiconductor physics will continue to have a huge impact on technological innovation. Other disciplines such as metal physics, crystallography, magnetism, optics, acoustics, insulator physics, thermal physics, low-temperature physics, and high-pressure physics will play an important role in technological innovation, and all these branches will continue to make extremely valuable contributions to the understanding of the objective world.
    
    The third is mechanics. This is the science of the equilibrium and movement of solids, liquids, and gases on the Earth's surface based on Newtonian mechanics. It is the theoretical basis of all engineering technologies. Due to the great development of engineering technology in the 20th century, the most prominent of which is the development of aviation engineering and aviation science, mechanics has developed into a wide range of independent science. Especially today, when artificial earth satellites and space rockets have reached the sky, mechanics has an even greater mission. The importance of high-temperature solid strength and high-speed aerodynamics to satellites and rockets is self-evident, and even the older theoretical mechanics has gained new important applications in solving the motion problems of artificial earth satellites and space rockets orbiting the Earth and the Sun.
    
    The fourth is the movement of matter and the problem of gravity in extremely large space and time ranges. This aspect of physics includes the structure and movement of galaxies in the universe, and most of its work has been incorporated into the scope of astronomy. However, the study of material movement and gravity will enable us to gain a deeper understanding of the structure of the universe, and therefore is of great importance to the comprehensive understanding of the material world.
    
    Fifth, due to the mutual combination of physics and other disciplines, a series of marginal sciences have been produced, such as geophysics, astrophysics, chemical physics, biophysics, physiological optics, etc. With the continuous development of social productive forces and the gradual deepening and expansion of the objective world, more and more marginal sciences will be produced by the combination of physics and other disciplines. Among these disciplines with important academic significance, geophysics can make important contributions to the development of the national economy.
    
    World's Industrialized Countries Attach Great Importance to Physics Research
    Judging from the current situation of physics in the world, all the world's industrialized countries attach great importance to the development of physics. There is no doubt that the development of Soviet physics ranks first in the world in terms of scientific level, development speed, cadre training, and the scale of research institutions. The physics of old Russia had an excellent historical tradition. Under the Soviet regime, physical science has been unprecedentedly developed. The peaceful use of atomic energy, the launch of artificial earth satellites and space rockets, the successful photography of the back of the moon, and the successful voyage of the Lenin nuclear icebreaker all illustrate the brilliant achievements of Soviet physics. Soviet scientists have not only made outstanding contributions to socialist and communist production, but also made outstanding achievements in the theoretical research of basic science. The recent completion of the theoretical work on superconductivity with a history of more than 50 years is a brilliant example. The Soviet Party and government also often attach great importance to and care about the development of physics in the Soviet Union. In the seven-year national economic plan published more than a year ago, the development of physics was listed as the primary position in natural science. This is worthy of our great attention. In our socialist camp, due to the importance attached to physics by the brotherly parties and governments of various countries, physics has also developed rapidly in various countries. Taking Poland as an example, the physics building of the University of Warsaw, which was severely damaged by the war, was quickly repaired after the war, and the instruments and equipment have exceeded those before the war. The Polish Party and government established the Polish Academy of Sciences after the war. After more than ten years of efforts, the research work of Polish physics has been rapidly carried out, and now it has a considerable scale and a relatively high level. In other brotherly countries in Eastern Europe, physics is also flourishing.
    
    Physics in the United States also has a relatively large scale. On the one hand, it absorbed a large number of physicists who fled from the European continent to the United States before World War II. On the other hand, the laboratories and research institutes related to physics established during the war were retained and expanded and developed after the war. There was also a saying circulating in the United States after the war: World War I was a chemical war; World War II was a physics war. In the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, physics is used to defend world peace and benefit mankind. In the hands of warmongers, physics can be used to slaughter peace-loving people all over the world. This is worthy of our vigilance. Capitalist countries in Western Europe, such as the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, have a long historical tradition in physics. In the past half century, Western Europe has made outstanding contributions in the field of atomic physics and nuclear physics. After the war, these countries also attached great importance to the development of physics. However, due to the fact that American imperialism did not hesitate to "invite" scientific and technical personnel from its partners to work in the United States with high salaries, the development of physics in these countries has been affected to a certain extent.
    
    Develop China's Physics at High Speed
    The scientific foundation of old China was very weak, and physics was no exception. The Kuomintang reactionary government and the previous Northern Warlords never attached importance to the development of scientific undertakings. In addition, during the Anti-Japanese War and the civil war launched by the Kuomintang, all physics laboratories were either severely damaged or unable to work. At the same time that the Soviet Union and capitalist countries vigorously developed nuclear physics and radio and electronics, we were particularly devastated in these cutting-edge disciplines. On the eve of liberation, China's physics showed a very weak scene.
    
    New China gave physics a new life. The Party and the government attach great importance to the growth and development of physics. At the same time as the establishment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, two physics research institutes were established; efforts were made to train physics cadres in universities; in addition, scientific research bases related to physics were gradually established in industrial sectors. The 12-year scientific perspective plan in 1956 promoted the leap-forward development of physics. Many important cutting-edge and blank departments rapidly grew up. The industrial production of semiconductor devices and the cadre training and scientific research work of semiconductor physics and technology were all carried out in a short period of time after the scientific planning. The development of the motherland's physics in the past ten years is amazing. This fully proves that science and technology must have the opportunity for leap-forward development under the absolute leadership of the Party. Only under the wise leadership of the Party can the broad masses exert incomparably powerful forces and infinite wisdom. The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has greatly promoted science and technology, including the development of physics. The Party put forward the correct instructions for tasks with disciplines, clarifying the direction of efforts and the goals of struggle for research work. The leap-forward development of physics in the past ten years is also inseparable from the selfless help of the great Soviet Union to our country. Our country currently has the largest atomic reactor and the 25 million electron volt α particle cyclotron in Asia. Due to the Party's call for the whole people to run atomic energy science, the national atomic energy industry has flourished. Semiconductor physics, semiconductor technology, and industrial production of components have also been greatly developed. We have manufactured high-speed electronic computers, electron microscopes, and large-scale spectrometers. Except for individual blank departments, the entire physics has made great leaps forward in the past ten years and has shown infinitely beautiful development prospects.
    
    However, because the original foundation of China's physics was too weak, the achievements already made are far from meeting the needs of the socialist construction cause. China's physics must not only be able to quickly and competently solve the physics problems raised in the development of national defense and the national economy, but also strive to provide new engineering technology with a theoretical basis.
    
    Under the brilliant illumination of the general line, it is necessary for us to develop China's physics at high speed; it is necessary to rapidly enrich and develop the physics departments and physics specialties of universities, greatly expand the base for training physics cadres; establish more physics research institutions, and solve more problems related to physics for the socialist construction cause of the motherland. Our physics workers should all put politics in command, accept the absolute leadership of the Party, humbly learn from the broad masses, and actively train young physics workers. Let physics flourish everywhere under the sunshine of the Party.

    物理学是自然科学的主导
    周培源
    物理学目前在自然科学中居主导地位。它已深入地渗透到自然科学各个部门和各项工程技术中。
    物理学的发展同生产发展的关系
    物理学是研究空间时间、物质运动的最普遍形态与物质基本结构的科学。物理学的产生成长和发展来自人们的生产实践。力学是物理学中最早系统化的部门。我国战国时代，墨翟对于力的概念和杠杆的原理已有初步认识。显然，杠杆原理的发现，是和封建社会生产力的发展，在农业劳动、建筑、运输等具体工作中减轻劳动力与提高生产效率的要求分不开的。从杠杆原理到最近代的原子能、热核反应、无线电、电子学与半导体物理等二千多年物理学的发展史，也是物理学和社会生产相互推动、相互促进的发展史。我们可以找到许许多多例子，来说明生产实践与对客观世界自然现象的观察怎样抽象为完整的理论系统。另一方面，物理学规律的发现与运用，又指出社会生产的新方向，开辟新的生产领域。科学与生产的紧密关系，在物理学的发展过程中特别具有丰富生动的例子。当前原子能的和平利用就是其中最突出的一个。
    物理学与生产的关系可从三方面来考察。第一，物理学提供社会生产能量转变的规律，并指出社会生产所必需的能量的来源。在十九世纪工业革命之前，工农业生产所需要的能量供应，主要来自机械能，如与人力、畜力、风力和水力有关的机械能。蒸汽机的发明和广泛采用提供了新的能量形式，使物理学工作者发现了能量守恒定律，认识到热能可以转变为机械能，而机械能也可以变为热能。能量不能产生或消灭，只能相互转换的客观规律的发现，对于物理学和生产力的发展都具有根本性的意义。在自然界的能量只能转换而不能产生和消灭的思想指导下，科学工作者和工程师们因而也认识到化学能、电能与机械能之间也可以相互转换。在发现电磁感应现象，发明发电机与电动机之后，电能与机械能的相互转换成为现实。内燃机的发明，开辟了贮存在炭氢化合中的化学能转变为可控制的机械能并被广泛利用的途景。感应发电机与电动机和内燃机在工农业生产上所起的巨大作用，是我们大家所熟知的。在十九世纪末，天然放射性、电子、X射线和电磁波等新物理现象的发现，使物理学工作者对空间、时间与物质运动、物质结构的看法，起了本质的变化。本世纪初，狭义相对论关于质量与能量联系的新物理规律的发表，使物理学和化学中的能量守恒与质量守恒这两个自然规律统一起来。再经过科学工作者与工程技术人员半个世纪卓越的创造性劳动，大大地发展了原子物理、原子核物理、原子核化学等学科，终于在优秀的苏联科学技术人员和工人们合作下，建成了世界第一座原子能发电站。从此由重原子核裂变并根据质量—能量联系定律所发出的巨大量的原子能受到了控制，并驯服地为人类服务。先进的苏维埃科学和工程技术界，正在集中力量解决控制由轻原子核聚变（也根据质量—能量联系定律）所发出比裂变大千百倍的能量的问题，虽然尚未完全成功，但已获得巨大成就。如果聚变能一旦被人类控制——它的实现不会在遥远的将来，那末人类将从自然界取得用之不尽的能源。掌握这些能源，可使人类的生活面貌大大改观。
    第二，物理学在社会生产力的发展过程中能提供物质材料的物理性能，从而提供制备新材料的理论根据与方法。不论国防、工业、农业、
  交通运输等方面所需要的机械和其它物质设备，元件材料是一个根本问题。从工程技术的角度看来，材料的使用必须满足既要牢固、耐久，又要经济等条件。固体的强度是早已为工程技术界所重视的物理问题。一方面，材料的客观的力学强度性质必须为机械、航空、土木建筑与交通运输等工程技术人员在设计中所掌握与运用；而另一方面，物理学对各种材料作进一步理论的微观性质的研究，对材料的使用可以打开新的局面。在过去三十多年中由于原子物理学的迅速发展，固体物理学也有相应的发展。按量子力学应用到固体强度的理论计算结果，固体材料的强度在理论上可以提高到几倍、几十倍，甚至几百倍到上千倍。不用说把固体强度提高到几十倍或几百倍的重大实际意义，即以提高一倍来说，就可以为国家节省大量的财富。五千万吨的钢材就会有相当于一亿吨钢材的效益。因此固体强度理论性的研究工作，对增产节约的贡献是无法估计的。
    此外，生产力的不断发展又向物理学提出新的研究课题。我们现在是处于原子能、人造地球卫星与宇宙火箭的时代。制造新的耐高温、耐高压的各种合金材料又提到日程上来。在原子反应堆或以原子能作动力的发动机中所用的材料，又须考虑到耐核辐射及腐蚀的性能。近年来低温物理学有很大的发展。物质在低温所呈现的超导电现象已开始在工程技术上有重要的应用。因此，固体在低温条件下的各种性能也有探讨的必要。很显然，固体在高温、高压、核辐射及低温情况的性能，与在常温、常压条件的性能是有根本区别的。
    第三，物理学的不断发展是社会生产力在发展过程中吸取新技术与新方法的源泉，也是其他科学部门采用新的研究工具与研究方法的主要来源。伟大的列宁曾经把电气化提到同苏维埃政权并列成为建立共产主义社会必要条件的高度。从物理学的角度看来，电磁感应现象的发现，是电气化的物理学的重要依据之一。同样的，对物质有透射性能的X射线已为医药界检查身体健康和工程材料内部探伤的重要工具。光谱学的发展使光谱分析方法在冶金工业中广泛采用；“光谱纯”的名称已在制备化学试剂中列为新的纯度标准。
    近代物理学给经济文化建设提供了新工具和新方法
    原子核内的中子和原子核在被冲击之下所呈现的人工放射性，是本世纪三十年代物理学界重要的发现。发现了中子与人工放射性之后，才接着有铀分裂的发现，因而开辟了利用原子能的远景。原子能的和平利用，不仅提供工农业生产的新的大量能源，同时也提供放射性同位素在工业、农业和医药卫生事业上的广泛应用。放射性同位素在工业农业上的应用可以分作两种类型。一种是，用射线从外部向内部照射，如用钴60所放射的γ射线来探查机械元件内部的损伤，用照射来改变材料的性能，促进植物的发育。另一种是让放射性同位素被吸收到物体内部去，从内部向外放射射线，以便检验物体内部的机理。在生物学中所采用的示踪原子，就是由内部向外部放射射线的。放射性同位素的效用，又比X射线大大推进了一步。
    近代物理学提供给工农业生产、医药卫生和其他科学部门科学研究工作的另一种十分重要的新方法与新工具，是无线电、电子学（其中包括固体电子学）和半导体技术。无线电是在本世纪初期发明的。它的发展则在第一次世界大战之后才开始，而在第二次世界大战中有了很大的推进。半导体物理学及半导体技术则在第二次世界大战之后，才形成发展高潮。在目前，半导体器件已在多方面代替电子管；甚至在导弹、人造地球卫星与宇宙火箭等飞行器中，就非用半导体晶极管不可。
    无线电电子学的理论与实验技术的应用，十分广泛。在国防、交通运输、人们的日常生活中，无线电与电子学的重要性已为大家所熟悉。在和平利用原子能的事业中，它们也占极大的比重。各种类型的加速器，大部分是无线电与电子学的工作，量度放射性的计数器也需要整流、放大等无线电与电子学的实验技术。电子计算机的发明与不断革新已使计算数学在国防及经济建设中成为一门非常重要的学科。无线电在观察天体上的应用已产生了一门新的天文学——射电天文学。至于力学、气象、化学、生物、地质等基本科学的研究工作中，也多多少少要用无线电与电子学的理论与实验方法。在目前生产自动化是工业生产中的一个尖端问题。导弹、星际航行都需要用自动控制和远距离控制的技术；这一些都是无线电与电子学的技术。总的说来，在目前工程技术与许多门科学的研究工作中，无线电与电子学占有十分突出的地位。
    物理学为工程技术和其它科学部门提供的研究方法和仪器设备还很多。比如，物理学中的电学、磁学的方法早已被用来勘探金属与石油的矿藏；超声学可用来探查材料的内部结构的损伤；光学中的紫外光、红外光与微波波谱等都有它们的应用领域。随着物理学的不断发展，将会给其他科学部门提供更多更好的新工具与新方法。
    很显然，上述物理学与生产的三方面的相互作用，彼此之间是有密切联系的。不可能把它们截然分开。本来，认识自然与改造自然之间就彼此相连。人们可以从对自然的认识来改造自然；相反地在改造自然中也可以进一步认识自然。
    近代物理学的继承和发展
    通过生产实践所发现的物理学规律，在进一步发展社会生产力中又能起它的积极作用，推动社会物质生产前进。而在另一方面，物理学本身也有它自己的内在矛盾与发展规律，这表现在它的继承性、系统性和现实性。狭义相对论的产生，是由于经典的牛顿力学的空间时间观念，不能解决在运动介质中的电磁现象；量子力学的创立，也是在旧空间时间的认识基础上所建立的原子结构理论，不能系统地说明所观察到的原子和分子光谱现象。从物理学的发展史看来，具有根本性质的物理定律的发现和运用，往往在生产实践中所产生的影响也更为广泛、更加深入。从1905年质量与能量联系定律的发表到1954年全世界第一座原子能发电站在苏联开始发电的整整五十年的时间里，物理学工作者进行了一系列的基本的但与当时的生产实践较为疏远的实验和理论的研究工作，他们的创造性的劳动导致铀核的裂变，原子反应堆的建立与原子能的和平利用。从电磁波发现以来无线电与电子学的五十多年中，基本理论性的研究工作，对这一部分物理学的发展所起的重要作用，也是物理学中另一个典型的范例。当然，物理学本身的发展也必须在社会生产力发展的前提下才有受到鼓舞与加速的可能。在手工业时代来建设大型加速器是不能设想的。
    物理学既是物质存在的基本形式——空间与时间——和物质运动的最普遍形态的科学，物理学所处理的运动问题可一般按物质运动的空间的大小来划分物理学的范畴。第一为基本粒子物理、宇宙射线和原子核物理。这是物理学在目前最基本的部分，它深入到物质最深的核心和物质世界最小的空间，而又常常牵涉到核子具有巨大能量的运动现象。世界许多国家对于这部门的物理学都付予极大的重视，建立各种类型和大小的加速器并在高空进行宇宙线的观察。苏联就有目前正在顺利运转的世界最大的一百亿电子伏特质子同步稳相加速器。苏联用人造地球卫星与宇宙火箭远离地球大气所观测到的宇宙射线的资料大大地丰富了我们对宇宙线成份的知识。可以肯定：这一方面的研究工作不仅导致重大的技术革新，而且在学术上将产生意义深远的结果，将使我们对空间与时间的性质、物质的运动与结构获得更深的理解。
    第二为以原子结构或与原子结构有关和电子运动为主体的关于电磁场、气体、液体和固体的物理学。这一方面包括创立较久而新近又获得巨大发展的物理学的许多学科。其中如无线电、电子学和半导体物理特别对技术革新将继续产生巨大的影响。他如金属物理、晶体学、磁学、光学、声学、绝缘体物理、热物理、低温物理、高压物理等都将对技术革新起着重要的作用，并在对客观世界的认识上，所有这些分枝将继续作出极有价值的贡献。
    第三为力学。这是在地球表面上以牛顿力学为基础的固体、液体与气体的平衡与运动的科学。它是一切工程技术的理论根据。由于二十世纪工程技术的巨大发展，其中最突出的为航空工程与航空科学的发展，力学已经发展成为范围广大的单独的科学。特别在人造地球卫星与宇宙火箭上了天的今天，力学更负有重大的使命。高温固体强度与高速空气动力学对卫星与火箭的重要性已不待言，甚至较为古老的理论力学在解算围绕地球和太阳的人造地球卫星与宇宙火箭的运动问题上也获得了新的重要应用。
    第四为在极大空间与时间范围内的物质运动及引力问题。这一方面的物理学包括宇宙中银河系的结构与运动问题，它大部分的工作已归入天文学的范围。但是物质运动与引力问题的研究，将使我们对宇宙的结构获得更深入的理解，因而对物质世界的全面认识有极重要的意义。
    第五由于物理学和其他学科的相互结合，已产生了一系列的边缘科学，如地球物理、天体物理、化学物理、生物物理、生理光学等等。随着社会生产力的不断发展和对客观世界的逐步深入和扩大，物理学和其他学科相结合所产生的边缘科学将越来越多。在这些具有重大学术意义的学科中，地球物理对国民经济的发展是能作出重要贡献的。
    世界工业先进国家十分重视物理学的研究
    从全世界物理学的现况看来，所有世界工业先进的国家都十分重视物理学的发展。毫无疑问的，苏联物理学的发展从科学水平、发展速度、干部培养和研究机构的规模来说，已居世界第一位。旧俄国的物理学本有优秀的历史传统。在苏维埃政权下物理科学又得到空前的发展。原子能的和平利用、人造地球卫星与宇宙火箭的上天并成功地拍摄月球背面的照片，以及列宁号原子破冰船的胜利航行，这都说明苏联物理学的辉煌成就。苏联科学家们不仅为社会主义与共产主义生产事业作出卓越的贡献，而同时在基础科学的理论研究中也作出了出色的成果。不久前完成已有五十多年历史的超导电的理论工作就是一个光辉的范例。苏联的党和政府也经常对于物理学在苏联的发展付予极大的重视和关怀。在一年多以前发表的七年国民经济计划中，物理学的发展列为自然科学中的首要位置。这一点是值得我们十分重视的。在我们社会主义阵营中由于各国的兄弟党和政府对物理学的重视，物理学在各国也有迅速的发展。以波兰为例，被战火严重地破坏的华沙大学物理大楼在战后就迅速修复，仪器设备已超过战前。波兰的党和政府在战后建立了波兰科学院。经过十多年的努力，波兰的物理学的研究工作迅速开展起来，到现在已有相当大的规模和比较高的水平。在东欧其他兄弟国家，物理学也同样蓬勃发展。
    物理学在美国也有比较巨大的规模。一方面，它在第二次世界大战之前吸收了一大批从欧洲大陆流亡到美国的物理学工作者，另一方面，它在战争期间所建立的与物理学有关的实验室和研究所在战后都保留下来，并予以扩充和发展。美国在战后还流传着这样一句话：第一次世界大战是化学战争；第二次世界大战是物理学战争。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，物理学被用来保卫世界和平，为人类谋福利。在战争贩子的手中，物理学则可用来屠杀世界爱好和平的人民。这点值得我们十分警惕。西欧的资本主义国家，如英、法、意等国，物理学本有悠久的历史传统，在过去半世纪中西欧在原子物理与原子核物理学的领域中都作出过杰出的贡献。在战后，这些国家对物理学的发展也给予极大的重视。但是，由于美帝国主义对于它的伙伴们的科学技术人员不惜以高薪“礼聘”到美工作，以致这些国家的物理学的发展受到了一定的影响。
    高速度地发展我国物理学
    旧中国的科学基础十分薄弱，物理学也不例外。国民党反动政府和以前的北洋军阀从来不重视科学事业的发展，再加在抗日战争与国民党所发动的内战期间，所有的物理学实验室，不是受到严重的破坏，就是无法进行工作。就在苏联及资本主义国家大力发展了原子核物理与无线电、电子学的同时，我们特别在这些尖端学科上受到极大的摧残。解放前夕，我国物理学特别呈现了十分衰弱的景象。
    新中国使物理学获得了新生。党和政府十分重视物理学的成长和发展。在中国科学院成立的同时，就成立了两个物理学研究所；在高等学校中大力培养物理学的干部；此外，在产业部门也逐渐建立和物理学有关的科学研究基地。1956年的十二年科学远景规划又促进了物理学的飞跃发展，许多重要的尖端与空白部门迅速地成长起来。半导体器件的工业生产和半导体物理与技术的干部培养与科学研究工作，都是在科学规划之后，在很短的时期内开展起来的。十年来祖国物理学的发展是惊人的。这充分地证明了，科学技术必须在党的绝对领导之下才有飞跃发展的机会。只有在党的英明领导下，广大群众才可以发挥无比强大的力量与无穷的智慧。工农业生产大跃进大大地推动了科学技术，其中也包括物理学的发展。党提出了任务带学科的正确指示，明确了研究工作的努力方向与奋斗目标。十年来物理学的飞跃发展也是同伟大的苏联对我国的无私帮助分不开的。我国目前已有亚洲功率最大的原子反应堆与二千五百万电子伏特α粒子回旋加速器。由于党全民办原子能科学的号召，全国的原子能事业有了蓬勃的发展。半导体物理学、半导体技术与元件的工业生产也有很大发展。我们已制成了快速电子计算机、电子显微镜及大型光谱仪。除了个别空白部门外，整个物理学十年来有了很大的跃进，并展示了无限美好的发展前景。
    但是，由于我国物理学原来的基础过于薄弱，已经取得的成就还远远不能满足社会主义建设事业的需要。我国的物理学不仅要能够迅速地、胜任地解决国防与国民经济发展中所提出的物理学问题，而且要努力使物理学供给新的工程技术以理论根据。
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们有必要高速度地发展我国的物理学；必须迅速充实与发展高等学校的物理学系与物理专业，大大扩大培养物理学干部的基地；多建立物理学的研究机构，多为祖国的社会主义建设事业解决有关物理学方面的问题。我们物理学工作者应该人人政治挂帅，接受党的绝对领导，虚心地向广大群众学习，积极地培养青年物理学工作者。让物理学在党的阳光照耀下遍地开花，蓬勃发展。
