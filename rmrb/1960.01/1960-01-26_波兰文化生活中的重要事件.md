    Important Events in Polish Cultural Life
    By our correspondent Li Ke
    Last year, as the Polish people prepared to bid farewell to 1959, the Polish Writers' Union held its tenth congress in Warsaw. This congress discussed important issues concerning the development of Polish literature, and it will play a beneficial role in clarifying the confused thinking that was once prevalent in Polish literary circles and in promoting the advancement of Polish literature along the socialist path.
    "People's Tribune" commented on the Writers' Union Congress, pointing out that the tenth congress largely reflected the beneficial changes that had begun in literary circles, and that the work of the Warsaw congress should be evaluated as an important step forward in the struggle for the development of Polish literature. The "People's Tribune" also specifically pointed out in its commentary that this congress was significantly different from the Writers' Union's ninth congress held in December 1958. At that congress, some writers attempted to oppose the Party's leadership and supervision of literature and art.
    As everyone knows, in recent years, revisionist tendencies have emerged among some writers in Poland. Although the majority of Polish writers support socialist construction and the leadership of the Party, a considerable number of writers have expressed a series of "strange and absurd arguments" on many issues, and have detached their creations from the real life of the people and the country's socialist construction.
    As pointed out in the materials of this Writers' Union Congress, since 1956, criticism of works from the period of 1950-1955 in writers and literary periodicals has often been "inflammatory and nihilistic," and criticism of the errors and shortcomings of the Party's literary and artistic policies and literary works during the People's Government period before 1956 has in fact turned into a complete erasure of achievements. This congress clarified this issue. At the meeting, Zolkiewski, member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and a famous cultural activist of the Party and the state, emphasized in his report entitled "Writers and Society" that the novels that have so far been the best in Poland in depicting the traditions of the working class struggle, such as Niewierny's "A Man's Road" and Rudnicki's "Old and New," cannot be erased from literary history.
    In his report at this congress, Zolkiewski also focused on socialist realism. Because in recent years, when some writers in Poland were discussing socialist realism, they also expressed many erroneous views, as if socialist realism was an outdated or too narrow concept, and some writers opposed taking socialist realism as the principle guiding creation. Due to the influence of anti-Marxist-Leninist creative theories, Poland once saw works after 1956 that specialized in exposing the so-called dark side of life and making incorrect and distorted portrayals of the reality of socialist construction. In response to these situations, Zolkiewski pointed out, "We must start the discussion on socialist realism again, because too many strange and absurd arguments have been made about this issue here. Now, no one will treat socialist realism as the only creative model in our literary life and impose it on others or prescribe it by order. However, this issue is one of the factors in the ideological struggle for the direction of the development of our literature, for the formation of writers' positions on the social and human tasks of art." He said: "In the struggle for the basic direction of art in our era, the decisive force is socialist realism." Zolkiewski also emphasized in his report that without socialist realism, the ideology of the working class and their current revolutionary movement would not be able to speak in art, and the most important things in modern and modern culture - socialist construction - would not be reflected.
    At this congress, the issue of Party leadership also received due attention. When Zolkiewski talked about the issue of Party leadership in his report, he said that the Party does not want to choose for writers, but only wants to fight for the correct direction of artistic development through ideological means. However, in terms of the social tasks of art, the Party's political guidance is necessary for writers. He said that it is difficult to separate the issue of art from the issue of the social role or political content of works. Therefore, the Party's voice should become a necessary contribution to solving cultural problems. The more importance and trust is given to the Party's political voice, the more fully the correctness of artistic forms is explored.
    The tenth Writers' Union Congress and the issues discussed at it aroused widespread repercussions among Polish writers. One of the most famous contemporary Polish writers, Kruczkowski, said in "People's Tribune" when talking about this congress: "I think the congress is a beneficial step on the road to clarifying the situation in the literary and artistic circles." When talking about the issues discussed at the meeting, Kruczkowski said that the socialist ideological and artistic program was widely put forward at the congress. Under our conditions, the maturity of art, art's participation in social life, and its position in social life depend on this program. At the Party's Third Congress, whether in Comrade Gomulka's report or in the resolutions of the congress, the principles of our cultural policy were clearly stated, and I think these principles should be accepted by every writer in our country who can think rationally.
    The tenth Writers' Union Congress elected a new leadership body, electing the famous Polish writer Iwaszkiewicz as the chairman of the Writers' Union and fourteen members of the Writers' Union Council, with Putrament and Zawieski being elected as vice-chairmen of the Writers' Union. As "People's Tribune" pointed out in its article commenting on this congress, Marxist writers occupy a prominent position in the composition of the new leadership body of the Writers' Union, which is also a manifestation of the political progress of the Polish literary circles.

    波兰文化生活中的重要事件
    本报记者　李克
    去年，在波兰人民准备送别1959年的时候，波兰作家协会在华沙召开了第十次代表大会。这次的代表大会讨论了波兰文学发展的重要问题，它对澄清波兰文学界一度流行的混乱思想、促使波兰文学沿着社会主义方向前进将起有益的作用。
    “人民论坛报”在评论这次作家协会代表大会时指出，第十次代表大会在很大程度上体现了文学界中已开始了的有益的变化，应当把华沙代表大会的工作评价为在争取我国文学发展的斗争中前进的重要步骤。“人民论坛报”在评论中还特别指出，这次代表大会同1958年12月召开的作家协会第九次代表大会有显著不同。在那次代表大会上，有些作家企图反对党对文艺的领导和监督。
    大家知道，最近几年来，在波兰某些作家中间曾出现了修正主义倾向。尽管大多数波兰作家是拥护社会主义建设和支持党的领导的，但是有相当一部分作家在许多问题上发表了一系列的“奇谈怪论”，并使自己的创作同人民的现实生活和国家的社会主义建设事业脱离开来。
    像本次作家协会代表大会的材料中所指出的，自1956年以后，在作家中和文艺报刊上，对1950—1955年期间的作品的批评，常常是“煽动性的和虚无主义的”，对1956年前人民政权时期党的文艺政策和文艺著作的错误和缺点的批评，事实上变成了对成就的一笔抹煞。这次大会曾对这个问题加以澄清。会上，波兰统一工人党中央委员、党和国家著名的文化活动家茹凯夫斯基在题为“作家和社会”的报告中强调指出，不能从文学史上抹煞那些迄今为止波兰最优秀的描写工人阶级斗争传统的小说，如内维尔利的“一个人的道路”和鲁德尼次基的“旧与新”等。
    茹凯夫斯基在这次大会上所作的报告中，还着重提到了社会主义现实主义。因为近几年来，波兰某些作家在对社会主义现实主义进行讨论时，也发表了许多错误言论，似乎社会主义现实主义是一种过时的或者过于狭隘的观念，一部分作家反对把社会主义现实主义作为指导创作的原则。由于反马克思列宁主义的创作理论的影响，波兰在1956年后一度出现了专门揭露所谓生活中的黑暗面，对社会主义建设的现实作不正确的歪曲描写的作品。针对这些情况，茹凯夫斯基指出，“必须重新开始关于社会主义现实主义的讨论，因为在我们这里对这个问题发表了过多的奇谈怪论。现在，谁也不会把社会主义现实主义当作我们文学生活中唯一的创作模型，而强加于人或用命令规定。但是，这个问题是为我国文学发展方向，为形成作家对社会和艺术的人类任务的立场进行思想斗争的因素之一。”他说：“在我们时代为艺术的基本发展方向而作的斗争中，决定性的力量是社会主义现实主义。”茹凯夫斯基还在报告中强调说：没有社会主义现实主义，工人阶级和他们目前革命运动的意识形态，在艺术中就得不到发言权，现代和现代文化的最重要的事情——社会主义建设就得不到反映。
    在这次代表大会上，党的领导问题也受到了应有的注意。茹凯夫斯基在报告中谈到关于党的领导问题时说，党不想替作家选择，只想通过思想的手段为艺术发展的正确方向而斗争。但是在艺术的社会任务方面，党的政治指导对于作家们是必要的。他说，很难把艺术问题同作品的社会作用或政治内容的问题分开。因此，党的声音应当成为对解决文化问题的必要贡献。越是重视和信任党的政治声音，探寻艺术形式的正确性也就越充分。
    第十次作家协会代表大会及其讨论的问题，在波兰作家中引起了广泛的反响。波兰当代最有名望的作家克鲁奇科夫斯基在“人民论坛报”上谈到这次大会时说：“我认为代表大会是在澄清文艺界情况的道路上的有益步骤。”克鲁奇科夫斯基在谈到会上所讨论的问题时说，在代表大会上广泛地提出了社会主义的思想艺术纲领。在我们的条件下，艺术的成熟性、艺术参加社会生活以及它在社会生活中的位置，取决于这种纲领。在党的第三次代表大会上，无论在哥穆尔卡同志的报告或是大会的决议中，都清楚地叙述了我们的文化政策原则，我想这些原则是我国每一个能理智考虑问题的作家都要接受的。
    第十次作家协会代表大会选举了新的领导机构，选出了波兰著名作家伊瓦什凯维奇为作协主席和十四名作协理事，普特拉曼特和扎维耶斯基当选为作协副主席。正如“人民论坛报”在评论这次代表大会的文章中所指出的，作协新领导机构的组成中，马克思主义作家占有显著地位，这也正是波兰文学界政治进步的表现。
