    Comprehensive Advance in Sichuan's Diversified Economy
    (By our report) Sichuan Province, with grain as the key link, has achieved a comprehensive leap forward in developing a diversified economy. According to statistics from relevant departments, over 90% of the harvested economic crops and economic forest products have greatly increased compared to 1958. The average increase in major varieties such as tea, raw lacquer, pine resin, gallnuts, medicinal materials, and palm fiber is about 70%. The number of pigs in stock has increased by 7.14% compared to 1958, averaging more than two per farmer, of which 84.6% are publicly owned. Draft cattle increased by 3.7%, poultry increased by 1.3 times, fish production increased by 50%, and commune-run industries have also greatly developed. Due to the comprehensive and large-scale development of diversified economy, the province over-fulfilled the 1959 procurement task of agricultural and sideline products one and a half months ahead of schedule.

    Over the past year, the reason why diversified economy has been able to achieve great results is due to strengthening the leadership of the Party, relying on the superiority of the people's communes' "large scale and high degree of public ownership," launching mass movements on a large scale, and fully utilizing the favorable natural conditions of the "Land of Abundance."

    An important experience accumulated by various regions in developing diversified economy is to do a good job in "four grasps" while strengthening political and ideological work: grasp planning, grasp characteristics, grasp opportunities, and grasp movements. In accordance with the principle of "unified leadership, specific planning, universal development, adapting to local conditions, distinct characteristics, and emphasis on certain aspects," various regions have formulated plans for developing diversified economy at all levels, which is an important link to ensure planned high-speed development. In formulating plans, we grasp both the immediate and the long-term; grasp both the key points and the general; grasp both major and minor items; grasp both products with historical traditions and new avenues of production. For example, Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Wanyuan, Chengkou and other places located in remote mountainous areas focus on developing animal husbandry, medicinal materials, and local specialties, while also paying attention to developing economic forests and agricultural and sideline product processing. In the hilly areas of the basin, the focus is on livestock and poultry, centered on pig raising, and economic crops, while taking into account other projects. Neijiang Prefecture, which has the most economic crops in the province, has also explored a complete set of leadership methods for comprehensively developing production, the content of which is: "leadership division of labor, designated areas and points, work queueing, comprehensive arrangement, labor demarcation, division of labor and cooperation, adapting to local conditions, and seamless connection, ensuring key points (i.e., grain) and highlighting characteristics (i.e., economic crops)." In 1959, the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations in this prefecture increased by 32% compared with 1958.

    In view of the large number of diversified economy projects, some of which are highly seasonal and technical, and often intertwined with agriculture, various regions have adopted a method of combining organizing specialized teams and launching mass movements. The province has established about 100,000 various fixed specialized teams for livestock and poultry, economic forests, commune-run industries, short-distance transportation, etc., with more than three million people. Various regions rely on this basic force as the backbone, adapting to the times, using agricultural production gaps, "inserting needles into seams," "large-scale movements contain small-scale movements," small-scale efforts during busy farming seasons, and large-scale efforts during slack farming seasons, with constant movements throughout the year. Wanzhou Prefecture seized the great opportunity of winter to develop diversified economy, and launched a series of crash campaigns for "small autumn harvest", afforestation, short-distance transportation, etc., from November of last year, which did not take much time but yielded great results. The region collected more than 270 million dan of wild crops, an increase of 18 times compared with 1958.

    Resolutely implementing the "walking on two legs" policy, which is dominated by collective management, and continuously improving business management are also important factors for the comprehensive development of diversified economy in Sichuan Province. The people's communes in various regions mainly focus on three-level management by communes, management districts, and production teams, supplemented by state-commune joint ventures, commune management district or commune production team joint ventures, and gradually increase the proportion of commune management on the basis of common development. Generally, projects that are large in scale, require a lot of capital, are technically complex, and are concentrated in production but are beyond the ability of the management district to manage, are directly managed by the commune; projects that are not large in scale, do not require much investment, have simple equipment, and are suitable for small-scale centralized management are managed by the management district; and projects that are scattered and self-sufficient are managed by the production team. In addition, under the condition that collective production is not affected, members are allowed to operate some small projects according to state regulations as a supplement to collective management. Over the past year, the implementation of the above policy has greatly promoted the development of diversified economy. For example, after earnestly implementing the policy of focusing on public ownership and public raising of pigs, supplemented by public ownership and private raising and private ownership and private raising, a hot wave of every commune, every team, and every person raising pigs has been formed, and since May 1959, the amount of pig raising has increased month by month.

    Another experience in developing diversified economy in Sichuan Province is that under the principle of unified leadership and unified arrangement by the Party committee, industrial, agricultural, commercial, and transportation departments carry out communist cooperation on a large scale, support each other, and cooperate closely.

### 统一领导具体规划　因地制宜各有特点　大宗小宗一齐抓  四川多种经营全面跃进

    统一领导具体规划　因地制宜各有特点　大宗小宗一齐抓
    四川多种经营全面跃进
    本报讯　四川省以粮为纲，发展多种经营，获得了全面跃进。据有关部门统计，已经收获的经济作物和经济林木中，90％以上的产品都比1958年大增产。茶叶、生漆、松脂、五棓子、药材、棕片等主要品种增产幅度平均在70％左右。猪的圈存数比1958年增长7．14％，平均每个农户已达两头多，其中公有占84．6％。耕牛增加3．7％，家禽增加一点三倍，鱼的产量增加50％，社办工业也有很大发展。由于多种经营的全面大发展，全省提前一个半月超额完成了1959年农副产品采购任务。
    一年多来，多种经营所以能够取得巨大的成绩，是加强党的领导，依靠人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，大搞群众运动，充分发挥“天府之国”良好的自然条件的结果。
    各地在发展多种经营工作中积累的一项重要经验是，在加强政治思想工作的同时，作好“四抓”：抓规划、抓特点、抓时机、抓运动。各地按照“统一领导，具体规划，普遍发展，因地制宜，各有特点，有所侧重”的原则，层层制定了发展多种经营的规划，这是保证有计划地高速度发展的重要一环。在制定规划中既抓眼前，又抓长远；抓重点，也抓一般；抓大宗，也抓小宗；抓有历史传统的产品，也抓新开辟的生产门路。如位于边远高山地区的通江、南江、万源、城口等地，以发展畜牧业、药材、土特产品为重点，同时注意发展经济林木和农副产品加工等项目。在盆地丘陵区以发展养猪为中心的家畜家禽、经济作物为主，兼顾其他项目。全省经济作物最多的内江专区，还摸索出一套完整的全面发展生产的领导方法，内容是：“领导分工、划片定点，工作排队、全面安排，劳力划线、分工协作，因地制宜、前后衔接，保证重点（即粮食）、突出特点（即经济作物）”，1959年这个专区农副业总产值比1958年增加32％。
    鉴于多种经营项目繁多，有些季节性和技术性又强，常常和农业交错在一起，各地都采用了组织专业队和开展群众运动相结合的办法经营。全省建立的家畜家禽、经济林木、社办工业、短途运输等各种固定专业队约有十多万个，三百多万人。各地依靠这支基本力量作骨干，因时制宜，利用农业生产空隙，“见缝插针”，“大运动套小运动”，农忙小搞，农闲大搞，一年四季运动不断。万县专区各县抓住冬季开展多种经营的大好时机，从去年11月份起分期分段开展了“小秋收”，植树造林，短途运输等突击运动，费时不多，收效特大。全区采集野生作物二亿七千多万担，比1958年增加十八倍。
    坚决贯彻以集体经营为主的“两条腿走路”的方针，不断改进经营管理，也是四川省多种经营全面发展的重要因素。各地人民公社都以公社、管理区、生产队三级经营为主，国家公社合营、公社管理区或公社生产队合营为辅，并在共同发展的基础上逐步增加公社经营的比重。一般规模大、占用资金多、技术性强、生产集中而又为管理区无力经营的项目，由公社直接经营；规模不大、投资不多、设备简单，宜于小型集中经营的项目，由管理区经营；零星分散和自给性较强的项目，由生产队经营。此外，在不影响集体生产的条件下，允许社员根据国家规定，经营一些细小项目，作为集体经营的补充。一年来，上述方针的贯彻执行，对促进多种经营发展的作用很大。如养猪自认真贯彻公有公养为主、公有私养和私有私养为辅的方针后，形成了社社、队队、人人大养其猪的热潮，从1959年5月份起，养猪量月月上升。
    四川省发展多种经营的又一条经验，是在党委的统一领导、统一安排的原则下，工业、农业、商业、交通运输各部门开展共产主义的大协作，相互支援，密切配合。
