	Launch the Masses to Boldly Innovate, Concentrate Forces to Besiege Key Problems
	The CCP Committee of Daye Steel Plant

	Concentrating Forces to Break Through Key Production Problems
	From late August to mid-December of last year, under the leadership of the CCP Huangshi Municipal Committee, we organized six campaigns targeting the main key in production—the smelting process.
	This was a large-scale mass movement with leadership, planning, and organization. The entire plant successively broke through 4,227 key problems, including 53 major ones. Under conditions of unstable raw material quality of pig iron, we still smelted high-quality steel—rimmed steel, alloy steel, etc.—and rolled high-quality steel products. The problems of unbalanced equipment and the lack of coordination between production and auxiliary departments have been initially resolved; the technical level of workers has been greatly improved; and management work has also been greatly improved. In a short period of four months, without increasing any equipment or investment, the entire plant's production outlook has undergone great changes, basically bringing into play the capacity of the new equipment, adapting to the requirements of sustained leaps forward, and laying a solid foundation for future production leaps forward.
	Since the six campaigns, the level of production has continued to rise. In the first half of December of last year, the average daily output of steel increased by 32.7% compared with August before the campaign, and steel products increased by 31.2%, and this could be consolidated and gradually increased. In four months, 92 new products were trial-produced, an increase of 3.38 times compared with January to July. The utilization coefficient of electric furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and converters increased by 28.11%, 18.64%, and 37.37% respectively compared with the first half of the year; the machine-hour output of primary rolling, medium-sized, and new small rolling mills increased by 24%, 40%, and 14.7% respectively. By December 10th of last year, we had completed the 1959 annual output plan for steel and steel products twenty-one days ahead of schedule. At present, the campaign is continuing to develop, and the mass movement of technological innovation is becoming more widespread and deeper; labor emulation has also developed from head-to-head competitions, linking competitions, and collaborative competitions to a joint technical performance competition participated in by all employees of the plant. Organizing campaigns and besieging key problems has become a good method for our plant's employees to enthusiastically welcome mass movements, vigorously engage in technological innovation, and promote sustained leaps in production.
	Overall Planning, Segmented Besieging
	Imbalances or new weak links will constantly appear in production, which are the contradictions in production. We must grasp the main contradiction, that is, the main key problem, in order to grasp the center and drive the general. The main key problems are often more complex and cannot be solved by one campaign, so we must plan comprehensively, strengthen leadership, fight in steps, and besiege in segments; we must have both a relatively comprehensive long-term plan and a short-term combat plan. We must consider both the necessary equipment conditions and material foundation, and we must give full play to people's subjective initiative as much as possible. The characteristics of our plant's production are that steelmaking, machine repair, and transportation capacity are small, and processing capacity is large. If steel production does not increase, the rolling mills cannot be fully utilized, and the production task of steel products cannot be completed. Therefore, we decided to shorten the battle line, concentrate superior forces, and focus on the smelting process, requiring all auxiliary departments to pave the way for steel and serve steel.
	After the main direction was determined, we adopted a method combining top-down and bottom-up, fully mobilizing the masses to investigate, identify, and determine the key problems. Starting from summarizing and analyzing the production situation, we looked for the main key problems and the main issues in overcoming them. Leaders and the masses studied and analyzed together, peeling away layers and reviewing step by step to determine the key problems. This mass method of investigation can be summarized into four phrases: "specific analysis, discussion and debate, on-site observation, and organized experiments." For example, the general goal of the converter workshop's campaign was to use local iron to make good steel and improve the furnace opening rate. This major problem includes many issues such as raw materials, operation, temperature, furnace life, management, and ideology. After everyone's discussion, the focus of the problem was low temperature and high sulfur and phosphorus content, making it impossible to make steel. The most prominent problem was the short furnace life, which affected the furnace temperature, so the furnace life issue was determined. How to extend the furnace life? It was necessary to modify the horseshoe-shaped wind ring and improve the quality of the furnace lining, and these were all determined. There was also the furnace lining problem that had not been resolved. Why was the furnace life short? The blowing workers said: The main reason was the poor quality of the furnace lining. The furnace lining workers said: The blowing workers had problems with their operation. At this time, the branch should ask everyone to express their opinions and debate, and at the same time organize the furnace lining foreman to go to the site to see and inspect each blown-out furnace, and found that the brick seams were too wide, and the furnace lining problem was very serious. Once ideological understanding was unified, the furnace lining issue was also determined. The branch immediately organized a "three-combination" team and conducted a test furnace, and the number of blowing times increased from 18 in the past to 38. After promotion, the maximum reached 52 times, and the furnace life issue was finally broken through. In order to ensure that the key problems were overcome, two important meetings were held from the plant level to the workshop level. One was the "key problem determination meeting," which carried out "four determinations" according to the key problem items, namely determining the key problem, determining the indicators, determining the person, and determining the time; the second was the "balancing meeting," which organized relevant departments to jointly review and uniformly arrange raw materials, equipment, labor, etc., according to the measures and requirements proposed by all parties, so that the campaign had material guarantees.
	Organizing Different Trades to Besiege Major Problems
	After the key problems are determined, the masses are organized to discuss and formulate plans, indicators, and measures for teams and individuals to carry out the campaign. In order to concentrate superior forces to overcome the key problems, we organized different units and different trades around the main key problems to cooperate closely and besiege the major problems; rely on our own efforts to break through the small problems; cooperate on related key problems, provide assistance on unrelated issues, and focus on the front line with support from the rear. In production units, we emphasize cooperation between furnaces and between various trades; in auxiliary units, we emphasize serving steel and paving the way for steel, and organize cooperation between various units. For the work of red-hot steel ingots in the rolling steel department, the heads of eight units, including the rolling steel department, the first and second steelmaking departments, the production section, the technical supervision section, the central laboratory, and the transportation department, were organized to follow the shifts on site, make requests to each other, solve them in a timely manner, and finally sign an agreement to ensure that the red-hot steel ingots could be promptly loaded into the soaking furnace. The technical visiting team of the power department went to various workshops to inspect electrical equipment, which was called "finding key problems on the doorstep." They found that the motor wire of the converter blower was grounded and the crane electrical appliances in the open-hearth furnace workshop had problems, and they immediately rushed to repair them to avoid accidents. For technically complex key problems, a "three-combination" professional team was organized to take full responsibility. We organized a "three-combination" professional team of electrical workers, steelmaking workers, and technicians from the power department to solve the electrical equipment problems of the electric furnace, from inspecting electrical faults and taking repair measures to formulating power curves and operating regulations, and finally found a way to increase the power of the transformer and shorten the electric furnace smelting time. Due to the promotion of a strong atmosphere of collaboration, everything served production and marched towards the main direction, and the work of departments and auxiliary departments showed a new situation, which was generally welcomed by production workers. In the campaign, because the leaders went deep into the key areas, the technical personnel rushed to the front line, and the workers were energetic, many old problems that had not been solved in the past were solved in a few days.
	Widely Establish Models and Carry Out Competitions
	Campaigns are good forms and good methods of technological innovation and technological revolution. The campaign is a mass movement with clear goals and a wide scope, so it is necessary to widely establish models and carry out competitions. The campaign pointed out specific goals for labor emulation, while labor emulation specifically organized and mobilized the masses for the campaign. With the development of the campaign and technological innovation, labor emulation has gradually deepened. Dozens of competition forms in our plant, such as head-to-head competitions, linking competitions, one-stop collaborative competitions, and hundred-ton steel competitions, have played a good role in overcoming the key problems. Since learning and promoting the advanced experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Group's joint technical performance competition, the competition has become a network and formed a system, and the combat capability of the campaign has been greatly improved. This is because the technical performance competition can not only fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all employees in the enterprise, but also concentrate the wisdom of the broad masses, rapidly improve the workers' operating skills, rationally adjust labor organization and management work, and use the most excellent advanced technology and advanced working methods to more effectively solve the key problems in production, which is in line with the requirements of the campaign. For example, when the electric furnace carried out head-to-head competitions, the daily output jumped from 240 tons to more than 300 tons. After organizing the joint performance competition, collaboration was strengthened and technology was improved, and the production achievement of 406 tons per day was achieved at the beginning. In the sixth campaign, our plant organized a plant-wide joint technical performance competition, sweeping 459 large and small key problems (including 11 major key problems) in five days, creating 248 new records, realizing 80 major technological innovations, breaking through the sulfur and phosphorus problems, and improving operating skills. The joint technical performance competition can be summarized in the following words: "Clear key problems, everyone is conscious, everyone performs, everyone strives for the first place, learns from each other, promotes each other, learns from each other's strengths, and improves together."
	Build While Besieging, Break While Establishing
	Key problems are broken through, production levels are improved, and management work, rules and regulations, labor organization, operating procedures, etc. must be reformed in a series of ways to adapt to the needs of production development. Many key problems are actually enterprise management problems. After unifying understanding, strengthening collaboration, and establishing a system, the problem is solved. Therefore, the entire campaign is a process of building while besieging, breaking while establishing, and unifying breaking and establishing. Some rules and regulations are changed in the process of the campaign, some are modified after the key problems are overcome after summarizing, and some need to be tested and determined after a period of time. In this period of the campaign, the outstanding performance in enterprise management is to change the cooperative relationship, so that the auxiliary units clearly establish the viewpoint of serving production. For example, the technical supervision section used to inspect steel products in the finishing workshop, so that steel products were often backlogged while waiting for inspection; now the inspectors go to the side of the forging hammer to measure the size of the steel products, and go to the demolding workshop to inspect the steel ingots, achieving "Steel product judgment goes to the workshop, errors are eliminated before acceptance, inspection is strict, fast and accurate, and finished products are not allowed to be backlogged in the workshop." In terms of labor organization and operating procedures, with the deepening of the campaign, there have been great improvements. In open-hearth furnaces, converters, electric furnaces, rolling steel, etc., many operating procedures that are both practical and have mass language have been created. The new operating procedure for open-hearth slag replenishment line is: "Large hook touches, small hook probes, look again after replenishing." We deeply realize that mass movements must be combined with strengthening enterprise management, and campaigns must be combined with daily production management work. The rules and regulations that the masses themselves summarize and that have been proven by production practice are the rules and regulations that truly meet the needs of production development.
	The entire campaign can be summarized into five words: investigation, identification, attack, competition, and construction. These are five links that are intertwined and have a certain stage, and the spirit of combining centralized leadership and mass movement runs through from beginning to end. Investigating key problems, identifying key problems, and determining key problems is to organize the masses to discover contradictions, analyze contradictions, and grasp the main contradictions. Overcoming key problems and technical performance competitions are to mobilize the masses, boldly innovate, and besiege key problems. Building while besieging, summarizing and promoting advanced experience, there should be a period of rest between the two campaigns to carry out mass summary to meet the requirements of consolidation and improvement, and prepare for the next campaign. The continuous campaign and the process of continuous circulation is also a process of coming from the masses, going to the masses, constantly discovering contradictions, resolving contradictions, constantly improving, and constantly innovating.
	Take Down the Production Barrier, First Attack the Ideological Barrier
	In the process of the campaign, we have always grasped the ideological struggle between advanced and backward, innovation and conservatism, and active and passive. To take down the production barrier, we must first attack the ideological barrier. For example, in the open-hearth furnace's campaign to hot charge double packs, some people thought: "It is risky to use local iron to hot charge double packs, and it is easy to have accidents." The party branch organized a discussion and debate on the topic of "Is it better to hot charge double packs or single packs?" Some workers calculated the detailed accounts, and hot charging double packs could produce at least 100 tons more steel per furnace every day than single packs. While debating, leading cadres took the lead and conducted experiments on Furnace No. 3 as the focus, continuously smelting 11 furnaces of hot charged double packs, which not only smelted high-quality steel, but also did not have any accidents. The fact that Furnace No. 3 quickly became an advanced furnace from a backward furnace ended this debate, and hot charging double packs was promoted.
	Another conservative idea encountered in the campaign was to blindly believe in foreign equipment, not trust the masses, and not dare to boldly innovate. Our plant's primary rolling mill and medium-sized rolling mill are highly automated equipment. After being put into production, accidents occurred frequently, and they were often in a semi-shutdown state. The workers proposed: "There are so many accidents, can't we change it?" Some technicians replied: "Comrades, the problem now is not to change it, but to learn how to master it." The party branch mobilized workers and technicians to discuss the relationship between people and machines: "Are you willing to be a slave to machines? Or be the master of machines?" Everyone realized: "We cannot be slaves to machines, we must be the masters of machines, and we must let the machines listen to our commands." After analysis, the employees believed that: The new equipment inevitably has defects in the design, manufacturing, and installation process, and these defects must be improved. Everyone organized a "three-combination" team led by leading cadres, while discussing and debating, while observing on the spot and organizing experiments, absorbing the innovative suggestions put forward by the workers, and adopted "forced demagnetization" and other small and large equipment improvements totaling 395 items, and quickly cured the diseases of the foreign equipment, and the output increased by about 50% compared with before the campaign. After this period of practice, we deeply realized the great significance of the truth that "politics is the commander, and ideology is the soul" for practical work.

    发动群众大胆革新　集中力量围攻关键
    中共大冶钢厂委员会
    集中力量突破生产关键
    去年8月下旬到12月中旬，我们在中共黄石市委领导下针对生产上的主要关键——冶炼关，组织了六次攻关战役。
    这是一场有领导、有计划、有组织的大规模的群众运动，全厂先后攻破大小关键四千二百二十七个，其中重大关键五十三个。在生铁原料质量不稳定的情况下，我们仍然炼出了好钢——沸腾钢、合金钢等，轧成了优质钢材。设备不平衡、生产和辅助部门不相适应的问题已初步解决；工人技术水平大大提高；管理工作也有很大改进。在短短四个月的时间内，没有增加什么设备和投资，全厂生产面貌就起了很大变化，基本上发挥了新设备的能力，适应了持续跃进的要求，并为今后生产跃进打下了巩固的基础。
    六次战役以来，生产水平不断上升。去年12月上半月钢的平均日产量比攻关运动前的8月份提高了32．7％，钢材提高了31．2％，而且能够巩固下来，逐步上升。四个月中试制新产品九十二种，比1至7月份增长了三点三八倍。电炉、平炉、转炉的利用系数比上半年分别提高28．11％、18．64％和37．37％；初轧、中型、新小型轧钢机的机时产量分别提高了24％、40％和14．7％。到去年12月10日，我们便提前二十一天完成了1959年全年钢和钢材的产量计划。目前，攻关战役正在继续发展，技术革新的群众运动越来越广泛，越来越深入；劳动竞赛也由对手赛、挂钩赛、协作赛等发展到全厂职工参加的联合攻关技术表演赛。组织战役，围攻关键，已经成为我厂广大职工热烈欢迎的大搞群众运动、大闹技术革新，促使生产持续跃进的好方法。
    全面规划分段围攻
    生产中总会不断出现不平衡或新的薄弱环节，这就是生产中的矛盾。我们必须抓住主要矛盾即主要关键，才可以做到抓住中心，带动一般。主要关键往往比较复杂，不是一个战役所能攻下的，因此就必须全面规划，加强领导，分步作战，分段攻关；既要有比较全面的长远规划，又要有短期的作战计划。既要考虑必要的设备条件和物质基础，又必须尽可能地充分发挥人的主观能动性。我厂生产上的特点是炼钢、机修、运输能力小，加工能力大，钢上不去，轧钢机吃不饱，钢材生产任务便完不成。因此，我们就确定缩短战线，集中优势力量，主攻冶炼关，要求一切辅助部门为钢开路，为钢服务。
    主攻方向确定以后，要采取自上而下和自下而上相结合的方法，充分发动群众查关、排关和定关。从总结分析生产情况着手，寻找主要关键和攻克关键的主要问题，领导和群众一起研究分析，步步剥皮，层层平衡、审查，确定。这种群众性的查关方法可以归纳为“具体分析，鸣放辩论，现场观察，组织试验”四句话。例如转炉车间攻关的总目标是土铁炼好钢，提高开炉率。这个大问题里面包括原料、操作、温度、炉子寿命、管理以及思想等许多问题。经过大家辩论，问题的焦点在于温度低，硫磷高，炼不成钢。最突出的问题是炉子寿命太短，以致影响炉温，这样便把炉子寿命关定下来了。怎样延长炉子寿命呢？要改装马蹄形风圈，要提高炉衬的质量，这都定下来了，还有一个砌炉问题没有解决。炉子寿命为什么短？吹炼工说：主要是砌炉的质量不好，砌炉工说是吹炼工的操作有问题。这时，支部便要大家各抒己见，鸣放辩论，同时组织砌炉工长到现场看，检查了每一个吹坏的炉子，发现是砖缝太宽了，砌炉的问题很严重。思想认识统一了，砌炉关也定下来了。支部立刻组织“三结合”小组，搞了个试验炉，吹炼次数由过去的十八次提高到三十八次，推广以后，最高达到五十二次，炉子寿命关终于突破了。为了保证攻破关键，从厂部到车间都开两个重要的会。一是定关会，按关键项目进行“四定”，即定关键、定指标、定人、定时间；二是平衡会，根据各方面提出的措施要求，组织有关部门共同审查，统一安排原材料、设备、劳动力等，使攻关战役有物质保证。
    组织不同工种围攻大关
    关定下来以后，就组织群众讨论，订出小组、个人的计划指标和措施，开展攻关破关。为了集中优势兵力攻关，我们就围绕主要关键，把不同单位、不同工种组织起来，通力协作，围攻大关；自力更生，突破小关；有关攻关，无关协作，前方主攻，后方支援。在生产单位，强调炉与炉之间、各工种之间协作配合；在辅助单位，则强调为钢服务，为钢开路，组织各单位之间的协作。轧钢部红装钢锭的工作，就组织了轧钢部、第一和第二炼钢部、生产科、技术监督科、中心试验室、运输部等八个单位的负责人现场跟班，互相提出要求，及时解决，最后订下了协议书，保证红钢锭能够及时装入均热炉。动力部的技术访问队到各车间巡回检查电气设备，叫做“上门找关”。他们发现转炉鼓风机马达电线接地、平炉车间的天车电器有毛病，都立即抢修，避免了事故。对于技术复杂的关键，便组织“三结合”专业队，包攻包打。我们组织了动力部电器工人、炼钢工人、技术员“三结合”的专业队去解决电炉的电器设备问题，从检查电器毛病，采取修理措施，一直到制定电力曲线和操作规程，终于找到了提高变压器功率的办法，缩短了电炉冶炼时间。由于大兴协作之风，一切为生产服务，向主攻方向进军，科室和辅助部门的工作出现了新的局面，普遍受到生产工人的欢迎。在攻关战斗中，由于领导深入重点，技术人员纷纷上前线，工人劲头足，许多过去没有解决的老问题几天就解决了。
    广树标兵开展竞赛
    攻关是技术革新和技术革命的好形式好方法。攻关战役是有明确目标而又十分广泛的群众运动，因此必须广树标兵，开展竞赛。攻关战役为劳动竞赛指出了具体目标，而劳动竞赛则为攻关战役具体组织和发动了群众。随着攻关战役和技术革新的发展，劳动竞赛也逐步深入。我厂对手赛、挂钩赛、一条龙协作赛、百吨钢赛等几十种竞赛形式，在攻关破关中都起了良好的作用。自从学习和推广了鞍钢联合技术表演赛的先进经验以后，竞赛成网，形成体系，攻关的战斗能力又有很大提高。这是因为技术表演赛不仅能够充分调动企业中所有职工的积极性，而且能够集中广大群众的智慧，迅速提高工人操作水平，合理调整劳动组织和管理工作，用最优秀的先进技术和先进工作方法更有效地解决生产上的关键问题，这正合乎攻关战役的要求。例如电炉开展对手赛时，日产量由二百四十吨跃到三百多吨，组织联合表演赛以后，加强了协作，提高了技术，一开始就取得日产四百零六吨的生产成绩。第六次战役，我厂组织了全厂规模的联合攻关技术表演赛，五天之内横扫大小关键四百五十九个（其中重大关键十一个），创造新纪录二百四十八件，实现重大技术革新八十项，大破硫磷关，提高了操作技术。可以用下面几句话来概括联合技术表演赛：“关键明确，人人自觉，人人表演，个个争先，互相学习，互相促进，取长补短，共同提高。”
    边攻边建有破有立
    关键突破了，生产水平提高了，管理工作、规章制度、劳动组织、操作规程等就要进行一系列的改革，这样才能适应生产发展的需要。有不少关键，实际上也是个企业管理问题，经过统一认识，加强协作，订成制度，问题便解决了。因此，整个攻关战役也就是边攻边建，有破有立，破立统一的过程。有的规章制度在攻关过程中就改变了，有的在关键攻下之后，进行总结才能修改；有的还要经过试验，看一段时间才能定下来。这一段时间的攻关战役中，在企业管理方面，突出的表现是改变了协作关系，使辅助单位明确树立了为生产服务的观点。例如，技术监督科过去在精整车间检验钢材，以致钢材为等待检验而常常积压起来；现在检查员到锻锤旁边去量钢材大小，到脱模车间去检验钢锭，作到了“钢材判定下车间，错误消灭验收前，检查严格快又准，不让成品压车间”。在劳动组织和操作规程方面，随着攻关战役的深入，都有很大的改进。在平炉、转炉、电炉、轧钢等方面，都创造了许多既切合实际又有群众语言的操作规程。平炉补渣线的新操作规程就是：“大钩摸，小钩探，补完以后看一看。”我们深深体会到，大搞群众运动一定要和加强企业管理相结合，攻关战役一定要和日常生产管理工作相结合。这种群众自己总结的、经过生产实践证明的规章制度，才是真正符合生产发展需要的规章制度。
    整个攻关战役，可以归结为查、排、攻、赛、建五个字。这是互相交错而又有一定阶段性的五个环节，自始至终都贯串着集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的精神。查关键、排关键、定关键就是组织群众发现矛盾，分析矛盾，抓住主要矛盾。攻关键、技术表演赛，就是发动群众，大胆革新，围攻关键。边攻边建，总结推广先进经验，是在两个战役之间，应有一段休整时间，进行群众性的总结，达到巩固提高的要求，并作好下一战役的准备工作。攻关战役不断进行，循环不已的过程，也就是从群众中来，到群众中去，不断发现矛盾，解决矛盾，不断提高，不断革新的过程。
    拿下生产关先攻思想关
    在攻关过程中，我们自始至终地抓住先进与落后、革新与保守、积极与消极之间的思想斗争。要攻下生产关，首先要攻思想关。例如平炉在攻热装双包的关键中，有些人认为：“使用土铁搞热装双包是冒险，容易出事故。”党总支以“搞热装双包好，还是搞单包好？”为题，组织了鸣放辩论。有的工人算了细账，搞热装双包每天每一个炉子至少比单包多出一百多吨钢。一边辩论，一边由领导干部带头，以三号炉为重点进行试验，连续炼了十一炉热装双包，不但炼出了优质钢，而且没有出任何事故。三号炉因此由落后炉很快变成先进炉的事实，结束了这场辩论，热装双包便得到了推广。
    在攻关战役中遇到的另一种保守思想，就是迷信洋设备，不相信群众，不敢大胆革新。我厂初轧机和中型轧钢机是自动化程度较高的设备，投入生产以后事故频繁，经常处于半停产状态。工人提出：“事故这样多，我们就不能把它改一下吗？”有的技术人员答复说：“同志，现在的问题不是改，是学会如何掌握它的问题。”党总支发动工人和技术人员讨论了人与机器的关系：“是甘愿当机器的奴隶？还是做机器的主人？”大家认识到：“我们不能当机器的奴隶，我们要做机器的主人，要叫机器听我们的使唤。”职工们经过分析认为：新的设备，在设计、制造、安装过程中难免会有缺陷，对这些缺陷必须加以改进。大家以领导干部为首组织了“三结合”小组，一边鸣放辩论，一边现场观察和组织试验，吸取工人提出的革新建议，采取了“强迫离磁”以及其他改进设备的大小革新三百九十五项，很快把洋设备的病治好，产量比攻关前提高了50％左右。经过这一段的实践，我们深深体会到了“政治是统帅，思想是灵魂”这一真理对于实际工作的重大意义。
