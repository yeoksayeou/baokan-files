    Jinsha Chengguan Commune Agricultural Middle School Conducts Teaching Based on Production Characteristics
    Cultivating Multi-Faceted Production Experts for the Commune

    (Reported by our newspaper) The Chengguan People's Commune Agricultural Middle School in Jinsha County, Guizhou Province, is a semi-agricultural, semi-study school that better combines the production characteristics of mountainous areas and the production development direction of people's communes. Its aim is to cultivate multi-faceted production experts and junior technicians in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

    This agricultural middle school was born under the situation of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communalization. In November 1958, according to the instructions of the Jinsha County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chengguan People's Commune merged the original Gu Xin and Longli Agricultural Middle Schools, which had relatively poor conditions, with the Chengguan Civil Primary Middle School to form the current agricultural middle school. At that time, there were three junior high school classes, one senior primary school class, 132 students, and three full-time teachers. In the early stage of the merger, only some simple work-study activities were carried out, such as picking tung seeds, collecting wild medicinal materials, and engaging in short-distance transportation, etc. The income was limited, the school's economic foundation was weak, and it was far from being self-sufficient. In March of last year, the commune established the Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Sideline Occupation and Fishery Department, which was concurrently managed by Zeng Ruiguang, secretary of the Commune Party Committee Secretariat. The new situation of diversified operations of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in the People's Commune requires the active cultivation of technical forces and production experts in this area. Therefore, the Commune Party Committee decided to put this school under the leadership of the department, and the technical personnel of the department served as production instructors in the school, with Zeng Ruiguang concurrently serving as the principal.

    After the teachers and students of the school clarified the direction of running the school and the purpose of teaching, their enthusiasm for learning soared. They put forward the resounding slogan of "Labor competing with farmers, study catching up with ordinary middle schools," and actively opened up diverse labor production places. Up to now, this school has 82 mu of farmland for rice and other agricultural crops, grafted and inserted more than 8,400 fruit trees, and raised more than 300 large and small poultry and livestock; there is also a fish pond with an area of ​​seven mu, as well as sewing factories, transportation vehicles, etc. In half a year, they achieved self-sufficiency. Through production practice, teachers and students have initially mastered the knowledge of planting major seasonal crops such as rice, corn, wheat, and rapeseed, the grafting techniques of apples, grapes, miscellaneous fruits, etc., as well as the scientific breeding and management of livestock and fish ponds, etc. Zeng Ruiguang also taught the teachers and students of the school his scientific research experience in beekeeping, chicken farming, fish farming, rice and vegetable planting, and fruit tree grafting over the past few years, so that teachers and students can widely use scientific principles in production and achieve a double harvest of knowledge and production. The rice they sowed adopted the rapid seedling cultivation method, the corn they sowed adopted seed soaking, seed selection and uniform seedling orientation, and the field management of wheat implemented self-flowing irrigation; radishes achieved two crops a year. They not only realized the slogan of "Production competing with farmers," but also set a good example for local agricultural production technology innovation.

    The production and labor projects of agricultural middle schools can generally be closely combined with teaching. What production is done, what production knowledge is learned. For example, when planting corn, the selection and mixing of corn seeds, planting density, uniform seedling orientation, and middle tillage fertilization are taught. When teaching chemistry, a local fertilizer factory is established as a laboratory; when teaching geometry, specific land surveying and campus design are carried out.... In short, emphasis is placed on the combination of theory and practice, the combination of teaching and production, the widespread use of on-site teaching, and the production garden is the student's large laboratory. What is learned in the classroom is what is done by hand. The students said: "Learning and applying like this, learning while using, the knowledge learned is both solid and practical."

    How to arrange teaching and labor time and labor projects according to teaching needs and the increase of students' wisdom has been a topic that this school has been exploring since its establishment. At present, they have gained some preliminary experience. Their arrangement of labor and teaching time is: four days of study and two days of labor per week. It is also flexibly adjusted according to the production season and agricultural leisure: more labor and less study during busy farming seasons and sunny days; less labor and more study during slack farming seasons and rainy days. The arrangement of labor projects is: the first grade focuses on agricultural production, requiring students to initially master general field crops and garden production knowledge. The second grade, on the basis of further familiarizing themselves with agricultural production knowledge, learns the hybridization of poultry and livestock and the grafting techniques of fruit trees. The third grade focuses on the feeding and management of poultry and livestock, and conducts some new variety cultivation. At the same time, due to the expansion of the school and the development of production, they have begun to pay attention to the clever tactics of improving tools to further reduce students' physical labor and exchange for more study time. Currently, they have used tractors for plowing and sowing, and ox carts for transporting fertilizer. The determination of teachers and students is: to realize the enterprise of agricultural middle schools. (Zhang Zhilin)

    金沙城关公社农业中学根据生产特点进行教学
    为公社培养多面生产能手
    本报讯　贵州省金沙县城关人民公社农业中学，是一所较好地结合了山区生产特点和人民公社生产发展方向，以培养农、林、牧、副、渔多面生产能手和初级技术人员为目的的半耕半读学校。
    这所农业中学，是在大跃进和人民公社化的形势下诞生的。1958年11月，城关人民公社根据中共金沙县委的指示，把公社原来条件比较差的鼓新、龙里的农业中学和城关民办初级中学合并成为现在的农业中学，当时有三个初中班，一个高小班，学生一百三十二人，专任教师三人。合并初期，仅开展一些简单的勤工俭学活动，如拣拣桐子，采集野生药材以及搞短途运输等，收入有限，学校经济基础薄弱，远远不能自给。去年3月，公社成立了林牧副渔事业部，事业部由公社党委书记处书记曾瑞光兼管。人民公社农、林、牧、副、渔多种经营发展的新形势，要求积极培养这方面的技术力量和生产能手。因此，公社党委决定把这所学校划归事业部领导，事业部的技术人员担任学校生产辅导员，曾瑞光兼任校长。
    学校师生明确了办学的方向和教学的目的以后，学习情绪高涨。他们提出“劳动赛农民，学习赶普中”的响亮口号，积极开辟多种多样的劳动生产场所。到目前为止，这个学校已经有八十二亩水稻等农田作物，嫁接和签插果木八千四百多株，饲养大、小禽畜三百多只；还有一个七亩面积的渔塘以及缝纫厂、运输车辆等。半年的时间，他们就实现了自给。师生们通过生产实践，初步掌握了大季作物水稻、玉米、小麦、油菜等种植知识，苹果、葡萄、杂果等的嫁接技术，以及牲畜、渔塘的科学饲养、管理等等。曾瑞光更把他几年来在养蜂、养鸡、养鱼、种植水稻、蔬菜和果树嫁接等方面的科学研究心得，传授给学校师生，使师生们在生产中广泛运用科学原理，获得知识、生产双丰收。他们播种的水稻，采用了快速育苗法，播种的玉米采取了浸种、选种和匀苗定向，小麦的田间管理，实行了自流灌溉；萝卜达到一年两熟。他们不仅实现了“生产赛农民”的口号，还为当地农业生产技术革新树立了良好的榜样。
    农业中学的生产劳动项目，一般都能较紧密地结合教学，搞什么生产，就学什么生产知识。如种玉米时就讲玉米的选种拌种、密植程度、匀苗定向、中耕施肥。教化学，就开办土化肥厂作实验室；教几何就具体进行土地丈量和校园设计……。总之，强调理论联系实际，教学结合生产，广泛采用现场教学，生产园地就是学生的大实验室，课堂学的就是手边做的。学生们说：“像这样学了就用，边用边学，学得的知识又牢固又实际。”
    如何根据教学需要和学生的智慧增长情况，来安排教学和劳动时间和劳动项目，是这个学校自建校以来一直就在摸索的课题。目前，他们已经取得一些初步的经验。他们对劳动和教学时间的安排是：每周四天学习，两天劳动。并根据生产季节和农事闲忙灵活调整，农忙和晴天，多劳动，少学习；农闲和雨天，少劳动多学习。劳动项目的安排是：一年级以农业生产为主，要求学生初步掌握一般的大田作物和园圃生产知识。二年级在进一步熟悉农业生产知识上，学会禽畜的杂交和果木的嫁接技术。三年级侧重于禽畜的饲养管理，进行一些新品种的培育。同时，由于学校的壮大，生产的发展，他们已经开始注意以改良工具的巧战办法，来更多地减少学生的体力劳动，换回更多的学习时间。当前，他们犁地、播种已经使上了拖拉机，运送肥料使上了牛车。师生们的决心是：实现农业中学企业化。　（张之遴）
