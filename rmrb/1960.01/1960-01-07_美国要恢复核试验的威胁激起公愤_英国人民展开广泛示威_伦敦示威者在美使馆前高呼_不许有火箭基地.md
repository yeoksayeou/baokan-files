　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: As the New Year begins, actions against nuclear weapons and U.S. missile bases are unfolding in many parts of Britain.

　　Eisenhower's threat to resume nuclear weapons testing has spurred these actions to be even more forceful.

　　In London, about one hundred demonstrators gathered in front of the U.S. Embassy on the 3rd to deliver a letter to Eisenhower, asking him to reconsider the decision to resume nuclear testing. They chanted: "No rocket bases here. Ban the (nuclear) bomb."

　　As many police officers ordered the demonstrators to leave the area, the demonstrators carrying anti-nuclear weapons signs chanted: "We don't want war, we want negotiations."

　　The letter was signed by about fifty prominent figures and passed at a mass meeting attended by more than a thousand people in Hyde Park that afternoon. The letter said, "We are shocked to learn that the United States government has decided not to continue the suspension of testing (nuclear weapons). This action is sure to frustrate the millions of people who long to be rid of the nuclear danger in which we live. We are convinced that this will arouse strong opposition to the U.S. government."

　　At the mass meeting held in Hyde Park, Labour MP Mrs. Joyce Butler considered the U.S. threat to resume nuclear weapons testing to be shocking. She emphasized that if the British people wish to enjoy life and peace, then the hydrogen bomb and rocket bases are things that Britain must face up to and abandon.

　　Roberts, Assistant General Secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, considered the recent U.S. threat a "new and catastrophic action" that must be stopped. He demanded: "We must quickly accept Mr. Khrushchev's proposal for complete disarmament within four years." Former Labour MP Mikardo, speaking at the conference, specifically opposed the U.S. bases in Britain, saying, "These bases are not Britain's last line of defense, but the first line of defense for the United States. They are established to protect New York and Washington."

　　Meanwhile, anti-nuclear armament marchers from the west coast to the east coast also arrived at their destination, Hull, on the 3rd. The number of marchers has increased from forty at the beginning of the week to more than two hundred. The marchers were welcomed by the residents.

　　On the 2nd, the British people began demonstrating in front of the U.S. missile base in Harrington, Southampton. This demonstration, organized by the "Committee of Direct Action Against Nuclear War," is scheduled to last for a week. When demonstrators pitched tents outside the missile base to prepare their campsite, police took suppressive action, arresting eighty-two demonstrators. But a second group of demonstrators raised flags and marched in front of the base.

　　The Executive Committee of the British Peace Committee passed a resolution on January 2, calling on people to make further efforts to strive for peace.

　　The resolution said, "The danger remains. France's plan to conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara, the United States' decision not to continue the suspension of testing, and the plan to arm West Germany with nuclear weapons could all create a situation that shatters the world's hopes for peace and disarmament. The anti-Semitism that has emerged shows that the confidence of those who have plunged the world into war twice in this century has increased." (Attached picture)
　　

　　On December 26 last year, British peace activists launched a large-scale peace demonstration across England, arriving in Halifax on the 29th in heavy rain.

    美国要恢复核试验的威胁激起公愤
    英国人民展开广泛示威
    伦敦示威者在美使馆前高呼“不许有火箭基地”
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：当新年开始的时候，在英国许多地方正在展开反对核武器和反对美国导弹基地的行动。
    艾森豪威尔要恢复核武器试验的威胁促使这些行动更有力了。
    在伦敦，约有一百名示威者3日集合在美国大使馆门前，向大使馆递交了一封给艾森豪威尔的信件，要求他重新考虑恢复核试验的决定。他们高呼：“这里不许有火箭基地。禁止（核）炸弹”。
    当许多警察命令示威者离开这个地方时，携带着反对核武器的标语牌的示威者高呼：“我们不要战争，我们要谈判。”
    这封信是由五十名左右著名人士签署的，并在当天下午在海德公园有一千多人参加的群众大会上通过。这封信说，“我们震惊地获悉美国政府已经决定不再继续停止试验（核武器）。这一行动一定会使渴望摆脱我们生活在其中的核弹危险的千百万人民感到沮丧。我们深信，这将引起对美国政府的强烈反对。”
    在海德公园举行的群众会议上，工党议员乔埃斯·巴特勒夫人认为美国要恢复核武器试验的威胁是令人震惊的。她强调说，如果英国人民希望享受生活和和平，那么氢弹和火箭基地是英国必须正视并且弃绝的东西。
    混合机械工业工会助理总书记罗伯茨认为，美国最近的威胁是一种“新的带有灾难性的行动”，必须制止这种行动。他要求说：“我们必须迅速接受赫鲁晓夫先生提出的在四年内进行全面裁军的建议。”前工党议员米卡多在大会上发言时特别反对美国在英国的基地，他说，“这些基地不是英国的最后一道防线，而是防卫美国的第一线。它们是为了保护纽约和华盛顿而设立的。”
    与此同时，反对核武装的从西海岸到东海岸的示威游行者也已于3日到达了目的地赫尔。游行队伍的人数，已从一星期前开始时的四十人增加到二百多人。游行队伍受到居民的欢迎。
    2日，英国人民在设在壮安普敦的哈林顿的美国导弹基地前面开始示威。这次由“反对核战争直接行动委员会”组织的示威，预定要持续一星期。当示威者在导弹基地外搭帐篷准备他们的宿营地时，警察采取了镇压行动，逮捕了八十二个示威者。但是第二批示威者又举起了旗帜在基地前面游行。
  英国和平委员会执行委员会在1月2日通过决议，号召人们进一步努力争取和平。
    决议说，“危险仍然存在。法国计划在撒哈拉进行核试验，美国决定不再继续停止试验，以及用核武器武装西德的计划，这一切都可以造成粉碎全世界对和平与裁军的希望的情况。已经出现的反犹太主义表明，在这个世纪里把世界两次投入战争的人的信心增加了。”（附图片）
    去年12月26日英国和平战士发动了一次横跨英格兰的和平大示威，他们于29日在暴雨中来到了哈利法克斯市。
