    Sichuan's Winter Production Achieves Victory on All Fronts
    Guangdong Uses the Effort Applied to Rice Management to Strengthen Winter Crop Management

    (Reported by this newspaper) Sichuan Province's rural winter production high tide has fully unfolded.

    After Sichuan province completed its "Four Autumns" work in early December of last year, it immediately organized labor to shift to winter production. In the past month, all aspects of production have progressed rapidly. Currently, more than half of the province's wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, and peas have undergone one round of topdressing and weeding, with many areas having completed two or three rounds. Simultaneously, a farmland capital construction campaign centered on large-scale water conservancy construction, combined with soil improvement and land leveling, is surging ahead. Over 86,000 water conservancy projects have started throughout the province, with over 50,000 already completed. On the fertilizer accumulation front, a heatwave of extracting fertilizer from animals, plants, and minerals has been launched, with pig raising as the center. In terms of diversified operations, the harvesting of economic forests and wild "Five Treasures," agricultural product processing and transportation, livestock and poultry breeding and reproduction, and other eight avenues to wealth creation, by mid-December of last year, according to statistics from the vast majority of special districts, the cash income alone had exceeded the original plan of an average income of ten yuan per person.

    As soon as the winter production campaign began, a socialist great competition, marked by everyone striving for advancement, rapidly emerged throughout the province. In Dazhou, Pingchang, Yibin and other counties, the competition was deepened within a few days to between people, between fields, and between high-yield areas. Wenjiang, Mianyang, Neijiang, Nanchong and other special districts have launched collaborative competitions between several counties, several communes or management districts, achieving mutual support, helping the poor catch up with the rich, and striving for common leap forward. The great collaboration of forty-four communes in Jintang County, jointly building the Tuojiang irrigation canal, irrigates 600,000 mu of farmland. After completion, the drought situation that has plagued twenty-two communes in the hills and mountains for years can be fundamentally changed.

    There are many aspects to winter production, the battlefront is long, and the tasks are very heavy. All localities fully rely on the superiority of the People's Commune's "Larger Size and Higher Degree of Public Ownership," and properly arrange labor and time, thereby ensuring that all battlefronts have labor to work on, and ensuring the comprehensive leap forward of winter production. More than 5,000 people's communes throughout the province have taken measures such as squeezing, extracting, transferring, and exchanging, in every possible way to compress non-production personnel and put more than 90% of the labor force into various productions. The specific methods are: ① Overall planning, dividing the battlefront, and rationally dividing labor according to the specialties of the commune members to establish professional teams; ② Grasp small-scale campaigns, combine the organization of professional teams with shock campaigns, carry out large-scale collaboration and large-scale corps operations, with very good results. Since the start of winter production, Weiyuan County has continuously carried out four campaign weeks centered on field management, farmland capital construction, and winter plowing, respectively, and each battlefront also has different key points in each campaign week. At present, small spring crops throughout the county have generally been topdressed two to three times, and pests and diseases have been basically eliminated; more than 900 small water conservancy projects have been completed, pigs have increased by 7% in more than a month, and more than 10,000 jin of green manure has been accumulated per mu of cultivated land.

    In order to improve work efficiency, a technical innovation campaign centered on tool reform is surging forward on all battlefronts. Nanchong Special District has launched a competition in the district in eight aspects of tool improvement and semi-mechanization, including water conservancy construction, livestock breeding, rice, sweet potato and wheat processing, and oil extraction. The tool reform in the district has been promoted to a stage of comprehensive development from point to surface. Xichong County mobilized the masses, relied on their own efforts, mainly using indigenous methods, combined indigenous and foreign methods, and built various indigenous machines on a large scale. The processing, storage, and transportation of sweet potatoes have all achieved semi-mechanization. More than 400 water conservancy construction sites throughout the province have achieved semi-mechanical construction.

    In this large-scale production movement, the leadership style of the Party committees at all levels in Sichuan Province is more in-depth, detailed, and specific. Party committee secretaries at all levels are assigned to different lines, contract specific tasks, go deep into the front line, vigorously engage in "command fields," establish pace-setters, grasp both the advanced and the backward, and lead the broad masses to continuously move forward. In Longchang County, a total of 2,006 points were established in four aspects: field management of small spring crops, water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation and production, and diversified operations, with more than 5,000 Party committee secretaries and cadres at all levels participating. These points all implemented the system of fixed personnel, fixed measures, and regular research, summarized the masses' many experiences in fertilizer production, tool improvement, and field management, discovered many problems, and promoted backward areas to catch up with the advanced.

    (Reported by this newspaper) Guangdong's 1959 winter crops were planted early, quickly, in large quantities, and well, and were managed earlier and better. At present, most of the province's more than 20 million mu of winter crops are growing vigorously, wheat has generally grown to seven or eight inches high, sweet potato vines are generally two or three feet long, and early planting has already produced tubers.

    Guangdong has three harvests a year. Last winter, all parts of Guangdong were determined to grasp winter planting as a crop, so they formulated plans more than a month before the autumn harvest and made specific arrangements. The province basically completed the winter planting task before "Minor Snow."

    In 1959, the province's winter planting area increased by more than double that of 1958; all localities also better implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and improved the quality of winter planting. The past phenomenon of "only planting and not managing or managing less, managing late" winter crops has been changed, and efforts are being made to manage winter crops well with the spirit of managing rice. Many areas emphasized that while doing a good job in farmland capital construction, they extracted the necessary labor force and adopted a combination of fixed professional teams for regular management and organizing the masses for temporary shock management to strengthen the field management of winter crops. For example, each county in the Foshan Special District organized more than 130,000 fixed professional teams to be specifically responsible for the field management of winter crops, ensuring that someone is responsible for each plot and conducts regular inspections.

    划分战线  统筹兼顾  大搞协作  大改工具
    四川冬季生产路路告捷
    广东用管水稻的劲头加强冬种作物管理
    本报讯　四川省农村冬季生产高潮已经全面展开。
    去年12月初，四川全省结束了“四秋”工作以后，立即组织劳力转入冬季生产，一个月来，各项生产进展很快。现在全省小麦、油菜、蚕豆、豌豆等中耕追肥一次的已占一半以上，许多地区已达到两次或三次。和这同时，以大兴水利为中心，改良土壤、平整土地相结合的农田基本建设运动也一浪高过一浪。全省开工的水利工程已达到八万六千多处，已完工的有五万多处。在积肥战线上以养猪为中心，掀起向动物、植物、矿物三方面索取肥料的热潮。在多种经营方面，经济林木和野生“五宝”的采摘和收获，农产品加工和运输，牲畜家禽配种和繁殖等八路进宝，到  去年12月中旬据绝大部分专区统计，仅现金收入就已超过了原订平均每人收入十元的计划。
    冬季生产运动一开始，一个以人人力争先进为标志的社会主义大竞赛迅速在全省范围内出现。达县、平昌、宜宾等县几天内，就使竞赛深入到人与人、田与田、高产片与高产片之间。温江、绵阳、内江、南充等专区都展开了几个县、几个公社或管理区之间的协作竞赛，做到互相支援，帮穷赶富，争取共同跃进。金堂县的四十四个公社大协作，合修的沱江灌溉渠灌田达六十万亩，修成后，丘陵和山区的二十二个公社历年干旱的情况就可以根本改观。
    冬季生产方面多，战线长，任务十分繁重。各地充分依靠人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，妥善安排了劳力和时间，从而保证了条条战线都有劳力去做，保证冬季生产全面跃进。全省五千多个人民公社一方面采取挤、抽、调、换等办法，千方百计压缩非生产人员，把90％以上的劳力投入各种生产，具体办法是：①统筹兼顾，划分战线，按社员特长进行合理分工，建立专业队；②抓小运动，组织专业队与突击运动相结合，开展大协作和大兵团作战，效果很好。威远县从冬季生产以来已连续开展了分别以田间管理、农田基本建设、冬耕等为中心的四次运动周，每一战线在每次运动周中也都有不同重点。目前，全县小春作物已普遍追肥两次到三次，病虫害基本消灭；完成小型水利工程九百多处，猪在一个多月中增加了7％，每亩耕地积青肥达万斤以上。
    为了提高工效，各个战线上的以工具改革为中心的技术革新运动风起云涌。南充专区在全区开展了一个水利施工、牲畜饲养、稻谷、红苕和小麦加工、榨油等八个方面工具改良化和半机械化的竞赛，全区工具改革已推进到以点带面全面开展的阶段。西充县发动群众，自力更生，土法为主，土洋并举，大造各种土机械，红苕的加工、收藏、运送全部实现了半机械化。全省水利工地已有四百多处实现了半机械施工。
    在这个大规模的生产运动中，四川省各级党委的领导作风更加深入、细致和具体。各级党委书记都分线包干，深入第一线，大搞“指挥田”，树标兵，既抓先进，又抓后进，领导广大群众不断前进。隆昌县在小春作物田间管理、水利、积肥造肥、多种经营四方面共建点二千零六个，参加的各级党委书记和干部达五千多人。这些点都实行了定人、定措施和定期研究的制度，总结了群众在造肥、改良工具、田间管理上的许多经验，发现了不少问题，并推动了后进地区赶上先进。
    本报讯　广东1959年冬种作物种得早、种得快、种得多、种得好，而且管得较早较好。目前，全省二千多万亩冬作物大部生长壮旺，小麦一般已长到七、八寸高，番薯藤一般已有两三尺长，早插的已经结薯。
    广东一年三熟。去年冬季，广东各地决心把冬种当作一造作物来抓，因此在秋收前一个多月就订出规划，并作了具体部署。全省在“小雪”前就基本完成冬种任务。
    1959年全省冬种面积比1958年增加了一倍以上；各地还较好地执行了农业“八字宪法”，提高了冬种质量。改变了过去对冬种作物“只种不管或少管、迟管”的现象，力争以管水稻的精神来管好冬种作物。许多地区强调在搞好农田基本建设的同时，抽出了必要的劳动力，并采取固定的专业队经常管理与组织群众临时突击管理相结合的办法，加强冬作物的田间管理工作。如佛山专区各县组织了十三万多人的固定专业队，专门负责冬作物的田间管理，做到丘丘有人负责，并经常检查。
