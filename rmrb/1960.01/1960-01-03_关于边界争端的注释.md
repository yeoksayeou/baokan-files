    Annotations on Border Disputes
    (I) Aksai Chin
    As pointed out in the letter, Aksai Chin is part of Ladakh. The Chinese government has now admitted that in 1956, it built a highway from Tibet to Xinjiang, and this highway passes through this territory for about one hundred miles. This highway was declared completed in September 1957. The following year, Indian personnel on a routine patrol were arrested near Haji Langar in northeastern Aksai Chin, taken to Suji Karor, and detained for five weeks. The leader of the Indian patrol was held in solitary confinement, and all documents were confiscated. The Indian government protested against the serious and continuous encroachment on our territory implied by the road construction and inquired whether the Chinese authorities knew anything about the Indian patrol. The Chinese authorities admitted that they had detained the Indian personnel. Later, these personnel were released at the Karakoram Pass.
    (II) Pangong Area
    In this area, the customary boundary between Ladakh and Tibet starts from the Lanak Pass (34 degrees 24 minutes north latitude, 79 degrees 34 minutes east longitude), along the watershed east and south of the Chang Chenmo River and the watershed south of the Qum Sang River, then along the south bank of the Qum Sang River and the east bank of the Changlung River. The boundary bypasses the western end of the eastern half of Pangong Lake, then follows the watershed of the Ang River, crosses Spanggur Lake, and then follows the watershed northeast and north of the Indus River. In recent years, Chinese armed personnel have crossed this boundary in several places, spreading out and illegally occupying Indian territory. In July 1958, the Indian government protested against the Chinese occupation of Qurna Fort, which is about one and a half miles inside Indian territory. This fort has been within Ladakh since ancient times, and there has never been any dispute about it. Even at the conference in 1924, attended by representatives from Tibet, Kashmir, and a British commissioner, regarding certain pasture issues in this area, there was no dispute over India's jurisdiction over this fort. However, no response has been received to the Indian government's note to date.
    In July 1959, it was reported that a Chinese armed force entered Indian territory in the Spanggur area south of Pangong Lake and camped at Spanggur. When a team of Indian police personnel heading to Qurna approached them, they were overwhelmed by superior forces. The Indian government protested, but the Chinese government replied that it was Chinese territory. This statement even contradicts the boundary line marked on Chinese maps. For example, in the Administrative Area Map of the Republic of China published in 1948, the boundary crosses the eastern end of Spanggur Lake. Spanggur is on the west bank of the lake. Although the Indian government had every reason to drive away this Chinese encampment, they did not do so, hoping that the Chinese would withdraw on their own.
    (III) Demchok
    Demchok, also known as Parigas, is another area of so-called Indian "encroachment." It is part of the Hanle area in southeastern Ladakh. The 17th-century Ladakh Chronicle and the writings of travelers in the 18th and 19th centuries all state that Demchok is part of Ladakh. Mount Kailash, as the watershed east of the Indus River, is located east of Demchok. Strachey, who visited this area in 1847, confirmed this, and Walker, relying on Strachey's statement, pointed out that the boundary of this area is east of Demchok village. The pastures between Demchok and the Kailash Mountains have long been used by Indian villagers. All tax records of this century prove that taxes in this area were collected by the Jammu and Kashmir government; a checkpoint has been established in this area for decades.
    (IV) Spiti Area
    Premier Zhou Enlai's letter stated that India had "encroached" on Giu and Chuje, which are in the Spiti area of Punjab Province. But the Spiti Valley is traditional Indian territory. The boundary of this area is the main watershed between the Baya River and the Spiti River system. As early as 1879, the "Hundes or Ali-Garsong and Monyurtu" published by the Indian Trigonometrical Survey marked the boundary along this watershed. In 1956, a Chinese survey team arrived in this area and attempted to place boundary stones on Indian territory. A Chinese patrol was discovered there in 1957. The Indian government brought these acts of encroachment on Indian territory to the attention of the Chinese government. The Chinese authorities neither denied the accusations nor declared that this land was part of Tibet. It seems they even lacked accurate knowledge of this place, as they asked India for detailed longitude and latitude information about it. The Map of the People's Republic of China (Yaguang Publishing House) published in November 1953 marks this place as being within India. Therefore, it is, at the very least, surprising to say that India has carried out aggression in this area.
    (V) Shipki Pass
    The Shipki Pass is the first of the six border passes mentioned in the 1954 Agreement. It has always been the boundary of Indian territory. All old maps show this as the border pass. The Indian government built a road that extends to this point and has maintained this road for many years. In 1954, the words "Hindustan - Tibet" were inscribed on a stone to the left of the pass. In the summer of 1956, a Chinese patrol was found on the Indian side of the pass, deep within Indian territory. When asked to withdraw, the Chinese personnel threw stones and threatened to use grenades. The commander of the Chinese patrol explained that he was instructed to patrol this area all the way to the Huppusang River, and if the Indian side crossed the Huppusang River, he would "use force to oppose it." The Huppusang River is four miles on the Indian side of the Shipki Pass. India's protest to the Chinese government regarding this encroachment has still not been answered.
    (VI) Nilang-Jadhang Area
    Premier Zhou Enlai said that there were many historical disputes in many places on the border from Ladakh to Nepal, and cited Sang and Tsungsa southwest of Zhaparang Dzong in Tibet as an example. In fact, this is the only area that the Chinese authorities have disputed. Sang is Jadhang village, Tsungsa is Nilang village, and Zhaparang Dzong is the district center of this part of Tibet. The Chinese Premier accused India of encroaching on Poling Sumdo, a village in the Nilang-Jadhang area called Polan Sonda.
    It is not true that this area has always belonged to China and that the British only occupied this place thirty or forty years ago. In the mid-17th century, Nilang constituted part of the Bushahr State (now part of Himachal Pradesh in India). A copper tablet from 1667 records a joint defense treaty between Bushahr and Junagarh, ceding Nilang to Junagarh. So it is clear that Nilang was within India at that time. Documents from the 18th century show that Junagarh managed this area at that time. The residents of this area are of Garhwali descent, not Tibetan descent.
    It is said that Nepalese troops destroyed Nilang village in 1804, but the Prince of Junagarh rebuilt Nilang village and the smaller village of Jadhang further north in 1850. In 1914, the Tibetans wanted to erect a boundary pillar at Gonggong La, south of Nilang. Four years later, the Prince of Junagarh also erected three boundary pillars at the Sangchuo border pass.
    In 1926, a boundary committee composed of representatives from Tibet, Junagarh, and Britain met in Nilang. The Junagarh government presented much evidence in its favor, including land ownership, road and house construction, and evidence of land tax collection for hundreds of years. The only evidence that the Tibetans could present was that their agents had occasionally collected taxes on trade with Tibet. This territory continued under the jurisdiction of the Prince of Junagarh, and after the Junagarh state merged into the Indian Uttar Pradesh province in 1948, it was under the jurisdiction of the Uttar Pradesh government. Since 1951, these villagers have not paid taxes to the Tibetans at all because they have stopped trading in Tibet.
    The Nilang-Jadhang area is located south of the main watershed in this area, and the six border passes mentioned in the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement are located on this watershed. In April 1956, we discovered that some Chinese armed personnel had entered this area without the permission of the Indian authorities. On May 2, 1956, the Indian government protested, but to this day, the Chinese government has not responded to this protest.
    (VII) Barahoti
    Barahoti, which the Chinese call Wu-je and accuse the Indian government of encroaching upon, is a small place (about one and a half square miles) in the Uttar Pradesh province of India. This area is located between the main watershed between the Xiangquan River and the Alaknanda River, which serves as the boundary of this section, and the highest Himalayan mountains further south. Tax records and other official documents from the 19th century all confirm that this watershed is the traditional boundary between India and Tibet in this area. Since the first maps of this area were drawn in 1850 based on surveys, this has been the way it has been drawn on Indian maps. Even Chinese maps published before 1958 marked this watershed as the boundary. Therefore, Barahoti, south of the watershed, must be regarded as being within India. Until 1954, neither Tibetans nor Chinese seriously opposed this situation, but since then, Chinese personnel have continuously come to this area. In April and May 1958, a meeting was held in Delhi to discuss this issue. The Indian representatives suggested that, pending resolution of the dispute, no armed personnel should be sent to this area. The Chinese government agreed to this point, but rejected the further suggestion that neither side should send civilian personnel to this area. Therefore, the Indian government continued to send civilian personnel to this area to carry out their long-established administrative jurisdiction in this area. For centuries, Barahoti has been managed by a land registrar, and officials from the Garhwal district have also frequently patrolled this area. Therefore, to describe the continuation of this management as "aggression" is a distortion of the facts. This accusation is more appropriate for the Chinese government, which not only sent civilian personnel but also violated the Delhi meeting's resolution by sending an armed force to this area in 1958. The Indian government cautiously adhered to the temporary agreement not to send armed personnel and even did not allow tax officials to carry weapons for self-defense. In addition, Chinese personnel also spent part of the winter in Barahoti in 1958, which was also contrary to normal practice.
    The Indian proposal at that meeting that even civilian personnel should not be sent into the area illustrates the extent to which India was willing to make efforts to resolve the issue peacefully. The only major argument put forward by the Chinese side was that some Tibetans called Shaji occasionally entered this area to collect taxes. However, these people were not regular officials of the Chinese government but merely people who facilitated trade, who came here to announce the opening of Indo-Tibetan trade and to check whether livestock entering and leaving Tibet were sick. They only collected taxes from those Tibetans who came here to trade, not from the local villagers. Even to this entry of Tibetan Shaji, the Indian government has been constantly protested.
    At the 1958 Delhi meeting, it was actually revealed that the Chinese did not even know which area they were referring to as Wu-je. So they insisted on going to the area for an investigation so that they could know which area they were claiming to possess.
    The other two places southeast of Barahoti that Premier Zhou Enlai's letter describes as being "encroached upon" by India are Xiangzha, namely Xiangzha Mala, and Labdi. They are located in the Almora district of Uttar Pradesh, on the Indian side of the Barcha Dhura Pass. This pass is located on the watershed that constitutes the traditional boundary between India and Tibet in this area. Edwin Atkinson confirmed this in his "The Himalayan Districts of the Northwestern Provinces of India" (1886). Xiangzha Mala is two miles south of the boundary, and Labdi is six miles south of the boundary. Chinese maps have never drawn these places within Tibet, and neither Tibet nor China has ever made a claim to their ownership. It was only in October 1958, when the Indian checkpoints were withdrawn as usual due to the impending winter, that Chinese personnel entered Indian territory and established posts in these two places. The Indian government's protest on December 10, 1958, has not been answered.
    (VIII) Ya-she, Khenzemane and Sha-ze
    Premier Zhou Enlai said that Indian troops had invaded Ya-she and were still occupying Sha-ze and Khenzemane. The Indian government does not know of a place or area called Ya-she. Judging from the location marked on the small-scale map recently published in Chinese newspapers, Ya-she is probably a small area northeast of the 15721 height marked on the Simla Convention map. In this area, the boundary line extends due north, and the place marked as Ya-she is within India. Indian personnel in this area have received strict orders not to cross the boundary line, and they have carefully complied with these orders. If Ya-she refers to Longju, then it can be stated definitively that Indian troops have never occupied it.
    Khenzemane is south of the Tangra mountain range, which forms the international boundary in this area. In fact, it was Chinese troops who invaded Khenzemane and tried to intimidate the Indian personnel there. Khenzemane and the Drok-sa meadows near it, located within the North-East Frontier Agency of India, have belonged to the Indian Lumla village for many years. The Le village and Thimud village in Tibet were permitted to use these meadows on the condition of paying grazing fees to the Indian Lumla village. There is no record of the Tibetan authorities ever exercising jurisdiction in the area south of the Tangra mountain range. As for Sha-ze, it is located south of Khenzemane, deep within India.
    (IX) Longju and Maza
    Premier Zhou Enlai said that Indian troops not only crossed the McMahon Line marked on the map attached to the British-Tibetan exchange of notes but also crossed the boundary line drawn on the current Indian maps, which are said to go deeper into Chinese territory than the McMahon Line in many places. It is said that Indian troops "occupied" Longju and launched an armed attack on the Chinese border troops stationed in Maza, forcing the Chinese border troops to fire back in self-defense.
    As explained in this letter, the McMahon Line on Indian maps is drawn strictly in accordance with the line drawn on the map attached to the Simla Treaty. Indian troops have not crossed the boundary line drawn on current Indian maps. The Indo-Tibetan border delineated by the Simla Conference left the watershed in the Subansiri area in order to leave the two sacred lakes of Tsokhar-po and Tsari Sarpa, the village of Maza, which is valued by Tibetans as the starting point for the pilgrimage every twelve years, the road from Maza to the sacred lakes, and another shorter pilgrimage road called Tsari Mingba within Tibet. The current Indian maps carefully leave these areas within Tibet. The international boundary in this area passes just south of Maza village. Longju, completely distinct from Maza, is located one and a half miles south of the boundary line. It cannot be part of Maza, which was a declining village with twelve huts in 1913 and further deteriorated, with only six huts and a monastery inn by 1935. The land belonging to Maza village is small and extends only a short distance outside the village.
    Until the recent Chinese invasion of Longju, the Tibetan authorities had never exercised administrative control over this village. The Indian armed police detachment was ordered only to resist invaders and to use force only for self-defense. It was the Chinese who first fired on the Indian outpost picket and later overpowered the Indian post in Longju by force. This act of deliberately attacking an Indian post with numerical superiority is completely unjustified. However, although Longju is undoubtedly Indian territory, the Indian government is prepared to discuss the exact delineation of the McMahon Line in the Longju area with the Chinese government. The Indian government has also proposed that as long as the Chinese government is willing to withdraw its troops, the Indian government will not send personnel back to Longju. The Chinese government has not yet responded to this proposal.

    关于边界争端的注释
    （一）阿克赛钦
    如信中所指出，阿克赛钦是拉达克的一部分。中国政府现在已经承认在1956年从西藏到新疆修建了一条公路，这条公路约有一百英里经过这块土地。这条公路在1957年9月宣告建成。第二年，执行例行巡逻任务的印度人员在阿克赛钦东北部的哈吉拦干附近被捕，被带到苏吉卡罗尔，扣留了五个星期。印度巡逻队的领队被单独禁闭起来，所有的文件都被夺走了。印度政府对筑路所意味的严重而持续的侵占我国领土的事提出了抗议，并且询问中国当局是否知道有关印度巡逻队的任何消息。中国当局承认它扣留了印度人员。后来这些人员在喀喇昆仑山口被释放了。
    （二）班公地区
    在这个地区，拉达克和西藏之间的习惯边界是从拉那克山口（北纬三十四度二十四分，东经七十九度三十四分）起，沿着羌臣摩河东面和南面的分水岭和丘谋桑河南面的分水岭，然后沿着丘谋桑河的南岸和昌格隆格河的东岸。边界绕过了班公湖东半部的西端，然后沿着安格河的分水岭，并穿过斯潘古尔湖，再沿着印度河东北面和北面的分水岭而行。近几年，中国的武装人员曾经在几处地方越过这段边界，展开来并且非法地占领了印度的领土。1958年7月，印度政府曾抗议中国人占领在印度边境内约一英里半地方的库尔那克堡。这个堡自古以来就在拉达克境内，从来也没有发生过争执。即使在1924年由西藏代表、克什米尔代表和一个英国专员所参加的有关这一地区的某些牧场问题的会议上，也没有对印度对这个堡的管辖提出争议。但是，到目前为止，还没有对印度政府的照会作出答复。
    1959年7月，据悉一支中国武装部队在班公湖以南的斯潘古尔地区进入印度领土并且在斯潘古尔扎营。当一队前往库尔那克的印度警察人员走近他们时，就被优势兵力所压倒。印度政府提出了抗议，但是中国政府在答复中说那是中国的领土。这种说法即使同中国地图上所标明的这一段边界线也是矛盾的。例如在1948年出版的中华民国行政区域图中，边界穿过了斯潘古尔湖的东端。斯潘古尔在湖的西岸。虽然印度政府完全有理由赶走这个中国营房，但是他们并没有这样做，而是希望中国人会自己撤退。
    （三）碟穆绰克
    碟穆绰克，又称巴里加斯，是所谓印度“侵占”的另一地区。这是拉达克东南部的汉里地区的一部分。十七世纪的拉达克编年史和十八和十九世纪的旅行家的著述都说碟穆绰克是拉达克的一部分。作为印度河东面的分水岭的开拉斯山位于碟穆绰克以东。1847年曾经到过这个地区的斯特拉彻证实了这个情况，瓦克以斯特拉彻的说法为依据，指出这个地区的边界在碟穆绰克村以东。在碟穆绰克和开拉斯山脉间的牧场过去长期为印度村民所使用。本世纪的一切税务记录都证明，在这个地区的赋税是由查谟和克什米尔政府征收的；一个检查站已经在这个地区设立了好几十年了。
    （四）司丕提地区
    周恩来总理的来信说印度“侵犯”了巨哇和曲惹，即旁遮普省的司丕提地区。但是司丕提谷是传统的印度领土。这个地区的边界是在
  巴雅河和司丕提水系之间的主要分水岭。远在1879年，印度三角测量局所发表的“洪达斯即阿里噶尔松和蒙育尔图”就是沿着这个分水岭来标明边界的。1956年，一支中国测量队到达这个地区，并且企图把界石放在印度领土上。1957年在那里发现了一支中国巡逻队。印度政府曾提请中国政府注意这些侵犯印度领土的行为。中国当局既没有否认这种指责，也没有宣布这片土地是西藏的一部分。看来他们甚至对这块地方缺乏确切的了解，因为他们向印度要关于这块地方的详细的经纬度。1953年11月出版的中华人民共和国挂图（亚光出版社）标明这块地方是在印度境内。因此，说印度在这个地区进行了侵略，最起码也是令人吃惊的。
   （五）什布奇山口
    什布奇山口是1954年协定所提到的六个边界山口中的第一个。它一向是印度领土的界限。所有的老地图都表明这是边界山口。印度政府修筑了一条一直通到这一地点的公路，并且好几年来一直保持着这条路。1954年，在山口左边的一块石头上刻上了“印度斯坦——西藏”的字样。1956年夏天，在山口的印度一边深入印度领土的地方，发现了一支中国巡逻队。在要求他们撤退时，中国人员就扔石块，并且威胁要使用手榴弹。中国巡逻队的指挥员辩解说，他得到指示巡逻这个地区，一直到活不桑河为止，如果印度方面越过活不桑河，他“要用武力来反对”。活不桑河在离什布奇山口四英里的印度的一边。印度对中国政府这种侵犯的抗议仍然没有得到答复。
    （六）尼兰—贾德汗地区
    周恩来总理说，在拉达克到尼泊尔的那段边界上，很多地方有历史纠纷，并且举出了西藏扎布兰宗西南的桑和葱莎作为一个例子。事实上，这是中国当局提出过争议的唯一地区。桑即贾德汗村，葱莎即尼兰村，扎布兰宗是西藏这一部分的区中心。中国总理指控印度侵占了波林三多，也就是尼兰—贾德汗地区的一个村，名叫波兰松达。
    说这个地区一直属于中国，英国只是在三、四十年前才占领这个地方，这是不确实的。在十七世纪中叶，尼兰构成了布夏尔邦的一部分（现在属于印度的喜马偕尔邦）。有一块1667年的铜碑记录了布夏尔和真日之间的共同防御条约，将尼兰割让给真日。所以很清楚，那时候尼兰就在印度境内。十八世纪的一些文件表明真日当时管理着这个地区。这个地区的居民是属于加瓦尔血统，而不是西藏血统。
    据说在1804年尼泊尔军队曾破坏尼兰村，但1850年真日王公又重建了尼兰村和更北的贾德汗小村。1914年西藏人想在尼兰南面的贡贡那拉地方树立一根界桩。四年后真日王公也在桑觉边界山口树立了三根界桩。
     1926年一个由西藏、真日和英国代表组成的边界委员会在尼兰开会。真日政府提出了许多对它自己有利的证据，包括土地所有权、筑路和造房以及几百年间征收土地税的证据。西藏人能提出的唯一证据是他们的代理人曾偶而对同西藏进行的贸易征收过税款。这块领土继续在真日王公管辖之下，在1948年真日土邦并入印度北方省之后，则在北方省政府的管辖之下。从1951年以来，这些村民根本没有向西藏人交过税，因为他们停止了到西藏去做生意的做法。
    尼兰—贾德汗地区位于这个地区的主要分水岭的南边，1954年中印协定所提到的六个边界山口就是位在这条分水岭上的。1956年4月我们发现一些中国武装人员没得到印度当局的许可侵入了这个地区。1956年5月2日印度政府提出了抗议，但是直到现在，中国政府对这个抗议还没有答复。
    （七）巴拉霍蒂
    中国人称之为乌热并且指责印度政府侵占了的巴拉霍蒂，是印度北方省的一个小地方（面积约一个半平方英哩）。这个地区位于作为这一地段的边界的象泉河和阿拉克南达河之间的主要分水岭和更南的喜马拉雅最高山脉之间。十九世纪的税务纪录和其他官方文件都确定这条分水岭是印度和西藏在这个地区的传统边界。从1850年根据测量首次画出这一地区的地图以来，在印度的地图上就一直是这样画的。就是直到1958年以前出版的中国地图也把这条分水岭标为边界。因此，在分水岭以南的巴拉霍蒂必须看作是在印度境内。到1954年为止，西藏人或中国人都没有严重反对这种情况，但是从那时起，中国人员就不断到这个地区来。1958年4、5月间，在德里召开了会议来讨论这个问题。印度代表建议，在解决争端前，不应派武装人员到这个地区去。中国政府同意了这点，但是拒绝了双方都不应派民政人员到这个地区去的进一步建议。因此，印度政府就继续派民政人员到这一地区去执行他们在此地区久已建立的行政管辖。几世纪以来，巴拉霍蒂就归一位土地登记官管理，加瓦尔区的官员也经常巡游此地。因而，把这种管理的继续说成是“侵略”，就是对事实的歪曲。这种指责对中国政府说来更为合适，中国政府不但派民政人员，而且违反了德里会议的决议，在1958年派了一支武装队伍到这个地区。印度政府谨慎地遵守不派武装人员的临时协议，而且甚至不让税务官为了自卫携带武器。此外，1958年中国人员在巴拉霍蒂还渡过了一部分冬天，这也是违反正常做法的。
    在那次会议上印度提出即使是民政人员也不应派入该地区的建议，说明印度为了和平解决问题愿意作何种程度的努力。中国方面提出的唯一的主要论据是：一些叫做莎吉的西藏人员偶而进入这个地区收税。但是，这些人不是中国政府的正规官员，而仅仅是促进贸易的人，他们来这里宣布开放印藏贸易，并检查出入西藏的牲畜是否有病。他们只是向那些来这里进行贸易的西藏人收税，而不向本地的村民收税。即使对西藏莎吉的这种进入，印度政府也一直不断地提出过抗议。
    在1958年德里会议上，实际上还表明中国人甚至不知道他们所称的乌热是指哪个地区。所以他们坚持要求到当地去进行调查，以使他们能知道自己要求据有的是哪个地区。
    在周恩来总理的信中被说成是为印度所“侵占”的另外两个在巴拉霍蒂东南的地方是香扎即香扎马拉和拉不底。它们位于北方省的阿尔摩拉区，在巴尔查·杜拉山口的印度一边。这个山口位于构成印度与西藏在这一地区的传统边界的分水岭上。爱德温·阿特金逊在他的“印度西北省份的喜马拉雅地区”（1886）一书中证实了这一点。香扎马拉在边界以南两英里，拉不底在边界以南六英里。中国地图从未把这些地方画在西藏境内，不论是西藏或者中国也从未提出过对它们的所有权。只是在1958年10月，当印度的检查站像往常一样因冬季即将开始而撤回时，中国人员才进入印度领土并在这两个地方建立了哨所。印度政府在1958年12月10日提出的抗议还没有得到答复。
    （八）雅斜儿、兼则马尼和沙则
    周恩来总理说印度军队侵入雅斜儿并仍然侵占着沙则和兼则马尼。印度政府不知道雅斜儿这个地方或地区。根据最近在中国报纸上公布的小比例地图所标的位置来看，雅斜儿大概是在西姆拉条约地图上所标的15721高地东北方的一个小地区。在这一带边界线伸向正北方，而标为雅斜儿的这个地方是在印度境内。这个地区的印度人员曾接到不得越过边界线的严格的命令，他们认真地遵守了这些命令。如果雅斜儿指的是陇村，那末可以断然地说：印度军队从来没有占领过它。
    兼则马尼是在形成这个地区的国际边界的塘格拉山脉以南。事实上，是中国军队侵入了兼则马尼并且试图吓倒那里的印度人员，兼则马尼和在它附近的位在印度东北边境特区内的德罗克萨草地，多年来都是属于印度的伦坡村。西藏境内的勒村和提穆德村在向印度伦坡村付款取得牧放权的条件下得到许可使用这些草地。从来没有过西藏当局曾在塘格拉山脉以南地区行使过管辖权的记载。至于沙则，它位于兼则马尼之南，深处在印度境内。
    （九）朗久和马及墩
    周恩来总理说，印度军队不仅越过了英国与西藏换文附图上所标明的麦克马洪线，而且还越过了目前印度地图所画的边界线，而这些地图据说在许多地方比麦克马洪线更加深入中国领土。据说印度军队“侵占”了朗久，并向驻在马及墩的中国边防部队发动了武装进攻，而使中国边防部队不得不为了自卫而还击。
    在这封信里已经说明，印度地图上的麦克马洪线的画法是严格符合西姆拉条约附图上所画的线的。印度军队没有超越过目前印度地图上所画的边界线。西姆拉会议所划的印藏边界在苏班西里地区离开了分水岭，为了把左喀尔坡和杂里·萨尔巴两个圣湖，作为每十二年一次朝圣的起点而为西藏人所重视的马及墩村，从马及墩通向圣湖的道路以及另一条较短的叫做察里明巴的朝圣道路留在西藏境内。目前印度地图对边界的画法很小心地把这些地区留在西藏。在这一带的国际边界在紧挨马及墩村南面的地方通过。完全区别于马及墩的朗久，位于边界线以南一英里半处。它不可能是马及墩的一部分，马及墩在1913年是一个有十二所小屋的衰落的村庄，以后更加衰败，到1935年仅有六所小屋和一家僧侣客店。属于马及墩村的土地是很少的，而且只延伸到村外很近的地方。
    直到最近中国军队侵入朗久以前，西藏当局从未对这个村庄行使过行政控制。印度武装警察分队奉命只是抵抗入侵者，并且只是为了自卫才能使用武力。是中国人首先向印度前哨纠察队开火，后来又用武力压倒了在朗久的印度哨所。这种以数量上的优势蓄意袭击一个印度哨所的行动是完全没有理由的。但是，虽然朗久无疑地是印度的领土，印度政府还是准备就麦克马洪线在朗久地区的确切划法和中国政府进行讨论。印度政府还提出，只要中国政府也愿撤回其军队，印度政府将不派人员回到朗久去。中国政府至今还没有回答这个建议。
