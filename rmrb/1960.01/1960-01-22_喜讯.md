    Good News
    Yueyang
    What an exciting night! It's the day the commune's hydroelectric power station transmits electricity for the first time.
    The round moon waited anxiously, peeking early from the eastern mountain. The stars also hurried onto the Milky Way. The sunset glow, like flocks of birds skimming the sky, also wanted to see the excitement, reluctant to return, such a bustling night in the mountain village!
    People beat gongs and drums to welcome the light. Because the power station uses their own labor and wisdom, bursting out with brilliance.
    Everyone stared unblinking at the light bulb, the sparks of the light bulb! Flash and shine quickly! Such impatient waiting! ...
    The gate opened, and the roaring torrent surged, driving the motor, thousands and thousands of red flowers bloomed!
    "It's lit!" A cheer of long live rang out! Waving forest-like arms!
    The children chattered endlessly arguing, "Who saw the light first!" Filled with immense joy, they jumped and played to their hearts' content, as if celebrating the New Year. The children wanted to feast their eyes on this boiling sea of lights, but sleepiness stubbornly crept onto their brows, wearing a necklace woven with a string of night pearls, faces still bearing unsettled smiles, entering sweet and happy dreams.
    Young people enthusiastically talked about the enchanting scenery of electrification in the mountainous areas, every sentence flashing with soaring drive!
    The girls moved with light and vigorous dance steps, accompanied by silver bell-like singing, praising the people's commune, singing about their beautiful hometown!
    An old man, wiping his eyes, tightly grasped the shining light bulb, refusing to let go: "Night pearl that generations have longed for, now, you are finally lying in my palm!" Tears of happiness welled up like a spring.
    The night is gone. Thousands of night pearl lights face the sun!
    More good news is constantly pouring in.

    喜讯
    岳阳
    激动的夜呵！是公社水电站第一次输电的日子。
    圆月亮等得心慌，早早地在东山窥望，星星也匆匆跳上了银河，晚霞与掠空的群鸟一样，都想看热闹，舍不得归去，多喧闹的山村的夜晚呵！
    人们敲锣打鼓的迎接光亮。因为，电站是用他们自己的劳动、智慧，迸发出来的光芒。
    都不眨眼的把电灯泡凝望，灯泡的火花呵！你快点闪发亮光！多急躁的等待呵！……
    闸门开放了，霍霍的激流，冲动了电机，千树万树红花开啦！
    “亮啦！”响起了一片万岁的欢呼！举动着森林似的臂膀！
    孩子们喋喋不休的争论着：“是谁先看见光亮！”他们怀着巨大的喜悦，尽情的跳呀闹呀，就像是过年过节一样。孩子们要饱看这沸腾的灯海，瞌睡终不听话的爬上了他们的眉梢，带着一串夜明珠编就的项链，脸上还挂着不平静的微笑，进入香甜幸福的梦。
    青年们热情的谈论着山区电气化迷人的美景，句句都闪发出冲天干劲！
    姑娘们迈动轻盈健壮的舞步，伴和着银铃般的歌声，把人民公社赞扬，歌唱她们美丽的家乡！
    有一个老人，擦着眼睛，紧紧捏住发亮的灯泡不放：“祖祖辈辈想念的夜明珠呵，这下，你毕竟躺在了我手心上！”幸福的泪水像是涌泉夺眶。
    夜走了。千百颗夜明珠的灯海朝太阳！
    更多的喜讯，正不断的涌来。
