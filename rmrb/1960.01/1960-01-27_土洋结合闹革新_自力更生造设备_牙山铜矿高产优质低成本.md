Copper Mine

(By Our Newspaper) The advanced collective attending the National "Conference of Heroes"—Yasan Copper Mine in Qixia County, Shandong Province—under the leadership of the Qixia County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, adhered to putting politics in command, conscientiously implemented the "walking on two legs" policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, vigorously carried out mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and achieved a comprehensive leap forward in high production, high quality, and low costs. Currently, the number of personnel in the entire mine has been reduced from more than 3,700 in the first quarter of 1959 to more than 500, while the average daily output of copper ore has increased from more than 20 tons in the first quarter of 1959 to 57 or 58 tons; the daily processing capacity of ore dressing has increased from 7 or 8 tons to 50 tons. The actual recovery rate of ore dressing has exceeded the national regulations, reaching over 92%, and the grade of copper concentrate averages over 16% (national regulations require 15%). The cost of copper contained in each ton of copper concentrate (calculated as equivalent to pure copper) is 2,100 yuan lower than the national allocation price.

This mine was established in April 1958. In the early stages of operation, there was a lack of experience, geological data, equipment, and technical personnel, resulting in many difficulties. The Qixia County Party Committee and the Mine Party Committee first led the workers to carry out extensive airing of views, big debates, and criticisms of various skeptical arguments, recognized the significance of vigorously developing copper mines, and established full confidence. After unifying understanding, the Mine Party Committee immediately mobilized the masses to launch a red flag emulation movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. At that time, one of the difficulties the mine encountered was that 500 blast holes had been drilled, but blasting could not be carried out due to the temporary unavailability of detonators, and production was on the verge of halting. After painstaking research, miner Li Shaodong used indigenous methods to create a "cotton detonator," which had a very good blasting effect, not only ensuring smooth production but also saving the state 40,000 yuan annually by adopting this substitute measure. Li Shaodong's innovation liberated the minds of the broad masses. Subsequently, miner Wang Lingshou created a "rocket" drilling machine, which increased work efficiency by more than 30% compared to manual operation. Within a few days, foot-operated drilling machines, drop-hammer drilling machines, and homemade electric drilling machines were manufactured one after another, increasing work efficiency by 30% to 100%, and mining efficiency rapidly improved. Subsequently, the Mine Party Committee led the workers to turn the spearhead of technological innovation to the lifting process. Worker Wang Lingshou created an aerial ore transport machine, which increased work efficiency more than four times compared to the windlass lifting equipment, quickly transporting the once-backlogged ore. There have also been major improvements in mining technology.

Due to the vigorous efforts in technical innovation, the entire mine has now basically achieved "tenizations," including windlass double-line bearingization, aerial transport trolley wire ropeization, tunnel transport tractionization, indigenous ore dressing standardization, and semi-mechanization of mining, greatly improving production efficiency. The implementation of wooden rails and aerial cable lines alone can save more than 54,000 labor days per year.

This mine also built an ore dressing plant with a daily processing capacity of 50 tons in 40 days in 1959. The equipment in the plant, such as flotation machines and classifiers, is very simple, easy to manufacture, and easy to operate. The yellow medicine and pine root oil required for ore dressing are all produced by the mine itself. They also took a series of measures to improve the ore dressing process, increasing the actual recovery rate from about 75% to over 92%, with a maximum of 94%, and correspondingly increasing the grade of copper concentrate, gradually reducing costs.

The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently held a national on-site meeting of small non-ferrous metal mining and ore dressing plants in Yantai, promoting the advanced experience of Yasan Copper Mine in conscientiously implementing the "walking on two legs" policy and vigorously carrying out technical innovation.

    土洋结合闹革新　自力更生造设备
    牙山铜矿高产优质低成本

    本报讯　出席全国“群英会”的先进集体——山东省栖霞县牙山铜矿，在中共栖霞县委领导下，坚持政治挂帅，认真贯彻土洋结合的“两条腿走路”的方针，大力开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，生产蒸蒸日上，实现了高产、优质、低成本全面跃进。目前，全矿人员已由1959年第一季度的三千七百余人减至五百余人，而铜矿石的平均日产量，却由1959年第一季度的二十余吨提高到五十七、八吨；选矿日处理量由七、八吨提高到五十吨。选矿实收率已经超过国家规定达到92％以上，铜精矿品位平均在16％以上（国家规定15％）。每吨铜精矿含铜成本（即折合纯铜计算），比国家调拨价格低二千一百元。
    这个矿是在1958年4月建立的。办矿初期，既无经验，又无地质资料，既缺少设备，又没有技术人材，困难重重。栖霞县委及矿党委首先领导职工开展了大鸣大放大辩论，批判了各种怀疑论调，认清了大办铜矿的意义，树立了充足的信心。在统一认识以后，矿党委立即发动群众，开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的红旗竞赛运动。当时，矿上遇到的一个困难，是已经打好的五百个炮眼，因为雷管一时供应不上无法放炮，眼看要停产。采矿工李绍东经过刻苦钻研，用土法制成了一种“棉花雷管”，爆破效果很好，不但保证了顺利生产，而且采取这一代用措施，每年可以为国家节约四万元。李绍东这一革新，使广大群众解放了思想。接着，采矿工王伦寿创造了“火箭”打眼机，比手工操作提高工效30％以上。几天之后，脚踏打眼机、吊锤打眼机、土制电动打眼机等纷纷制造出来，提高工效30％到一倍，采矿效率迅速提高，接着，矿党委又领导职工把革新技术的矛头转向提升工序。工人王伦寿创造了空中运矿机，比辘轳提升设备提高工效四倍以上，把一度积压的矿石迅速运了出来。在开采技术方面也有了重大改进。
    由于大闹技术革新，目前，全矿已经基本上实现了辘轳双线轴承化、空中运输滑车钢丝化、坑道运输牵引化、土法选矿标准化、开采半机械化等“十化”，大大提高了生产效率。仅推行木轨道和空中滑线两项，一年就可以节省五万四千多个劳动日。
    这个矿还在1959年用四十天时间建起了一座日处理五十吨的选矿厂。厂里的设备，如浮选机、分级机等，都很简单，容易制造，容易操作。选矿需用的黄药和松根油，都是自己生产。他们还采取了一系列措施，改进了选矿流程，使选矿实收率由原来的75％左右提高到92％以上，最高达到94％，并相应地提高了铜精矿的品位，逐步降低了成本。
    冶金工业部最近在烟台召开了全国有色金属小型采选厂现场会议，推广了牙山铜矿认真贯彻执行“两条腿走路”方针和大闹技术革新的先进经验。（附图片）
