First Scene

    "Red Flag Song"
    On a thousand-mile embankment, beneath a large tree, stands a solemn ancient bell, a crystallization of labor and beauty, a testament to the interests of the forty-eight villages.

    A conspiracy is underway: the landlord Feng Lanchi wants to smash the bell to silence dissent and seize public property. In the overcast sky, Feng Lanchi's black oil hammer is raised. Below the embankment, the crowd suppresses their anger. The ancient bell is in imminent danger. A thunderous "Stop!" rings out! In the voice, Zhu Laogong, bare-chested and wielding a gleaming guillotine, leaps onto the bell platform in one stride. With the support of the villagers, he tears up the fake deed forged by the landlord in an attempt to deceive the heavens. The enraged landlord orders, "Even if the sky falls, I'll hold it up! Smash the bell for me!" Zhu Laogong raises the sharp guillotine towards the landlord class, who has been running rampant for generations, and roars, "Whoever dares to smash the bell will have to answer to my guillotine!" The oil hammer falls, and the landlord trembles like a late-autumn leaf.

    Zhu Laogong, this hero representing the peasants' will to resist, sacrifices himself in the struggle. A raging storm sweeps across the land, and the turbulent Hutuo River batters the embankment with its waves. Zhu Laogong's spirit will unleash a revolutionary storm.

    The film "Red Flag Song," based on the original novel by Liang Bin, directed by Ling Zifeng, and starring Cui Wei, is currently in intense production at the Beijing Film Studio. The above are just glimpses of the film's scenes.

    “红旗谱”
    千里堤上，大树下，肃穆地立着古钟，它是劳动的、美的结晶，是四十八村人民利益的见证。
    一个阴谋在进行，地主冯兰池要砸钟灭口，吞并公产。阴霾的空中，冯兰池的黑色油锤举起了，堤下人群抑制着一片怒火，古钟在千钧一发之际。一声雷鸣般的“住手”！声中，朱老巩敞怀赤臂手提雪亮的大铡刀，一个虎步跳上钟台，在众乡亲的支持下撕毁了地主企图偷天换日伪造的假契。狂怒的地主命令道：“天塌了，我托着！给我砸钟！”朱老巩向横行一世的地主阶级举起锋利的大铡刀，怒吼道：“谁敢砸钟，就朝我这口铡刀说话！”油锤落下了，地主像秋日迟雕的树叶颤抖着。
    这个代表着农民反抗意志的英雄朱老巩在斗争中牺牲了。狂风咆哮席卷大地，滹沱河巨浪怒击堤岸，朱老巩的精神将掀起革命的风暴。
    梁斌原著、凌子风导演、崔嵬主演的影片“红旗谱”，正由北京电影制片厂紧张的摄制中。上面是影片镜头的点滴。
