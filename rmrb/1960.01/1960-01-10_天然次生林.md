Small Information

    Natural Secondary Forest

    Natural secondary forest refers to forests that have recovered after being destroyed by reckless felling and burning in the old society and subsequently managed and protected after liberation. Natural secondary forests are scattered and interspersed with farmland and pastureland; they have many young trees and low unit storage; they have low density, with a large proportion of sparse forests and shrubs; the main tree species are mostly poplar, birch, and oak in the north, and Castanopsis, Castanea, Liquidambar formosana, and other broad-leaved trees in the south, with very few coniferous trees.

    The socio-economic conditions in natural secondary forest areas are better than those in virgin forest areas, and the natural environment is better than that in barren mountains. They are good bases for cultivating timber forests and economic forests.

    天然次生林
    天然次生林，是天然林经过旧社会乱砍滥伐和火灾的破坏，解放后经过管理保护，再次恢复起来的森林。天然次生林零星分散，与农田牧地相互交错；幼林多，单位蓄积量低；密度小，疏林灌木所占比重较大；主要树种在北方多是山杨、桦木和栎类，在南方多是槠、栲、枫香等阔叶树，针叶树很少。
    天然次生林区的社会经济条件较原始林区优越，自然环境比荒山地区良好，是培育用材林、经济林的良好基地。
