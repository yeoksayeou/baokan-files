The Voice of the Indian People
——What I Saw at the China Pavilion of the New Delhi World Agricultural Fair
By Our Correspondent Tu Peilin

The World Agricultural Fair, which opened in New Delhi on December 11th last year, featured exhibition halls from the Indian central government and various provinces, as well as twelve invited countries including the Soviet Union, China, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Mongolia, Burma, Iraq, Afghanistan, Ceylon, Iran, and the United States. The China Pavilion covered an area of over 70,000 square feet, making it one of the largest exhibition halls at the fair. Since its opening, people from all walks of life in India have flocked to the China Pavilion every day. In just over a month and a half, the China Pavilion has received over one million visitors. On Sundays and holidays, the China Pavilion receives 100-200 visitors per minute. Indian President Prasad, Vice President Radhakrishnan, Speaker of the People's Assembly Ayyangar, as well as many ministers, members of parliament, and senior officials from the central government and provinces have also visited the China Pavilion. Whether they are farmers from distant Assam or Madras in South India, agricultural science researchers from Calcutta, Bombay, and Bihar, or office workers, students, and citizens of Delhi, they are all very concerned about learning about the people's communes and economic construction in New China, understanding the leap forward achievements in Chinese agricultural production, and specific experiences in increasing production.

People learned what they wanted to know from the exhibition hall. Large-scale photographs, charts, electric models, and abundant physical objects systematically introduced visitors to the achievements of agricultural production and construction in New China over the past decade, as well as the development of forestry, animal husbandry, aquaculture, and people's commune industries. Experts in rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, animal husbandry, etc. from the Chinese exhibition hall, as well as Luo Shifa, the head of Xinmin People's Commune in Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, Chen Bingyin, the head of Chaya Mountain People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan Province, Ma Baoshan, the head of Hanjiawa People's Commune in Ding County, Hebei Province, and Zhou Xiaomei from Tanqiao Production Team of Pengpu People's Commune in Shanghai, warmly received the audience in the exhibition hall every day, answered various questions raised by the people, and exchanged experiences in agricultural production with Indian farmers and experts. Indian friends were extremely interested in the introduction of China's current magic weapon for increasing agricultural production—the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and the people's communes. With surprised and moved expressions, they listened to how China solved the food problem and what it meant to eat without paying. In the exhibition hall, tall and sturdy cotton plants laden with bolls, rice, wheat, and corn with large ears, sorghum that was three people high when looking up... as well as various electric models illustrating water conservancy construction, afforestation, transformation of low-lying land, diverting water up the mountains, maintaining water and soil, and developing rural hydropower stations... were often surrounded by dense crowds of visitors. They took notes with pens and paper, carefully copying the specific measures for increasing production on the explanatory signs. Every day, many, many visitors also requested improved seeds and technical information from the China Pavilion. Although the weather in New Delhi is quite cold at night, the open-air cinema in the China Pavilion is packed with audiences every night.

In the outdoor square of the exhibition hall, large Chinese-made tractors, combine harvesters, trucks, and irrigation and drainage tools were displayed. A group of elderly farmers from Punjab asked Gao Fengxiang, a worker from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory standing on the driver's platform of the combine harvester: "Do these large farm tools belong to landlords?" When they heard that they did not belong to landlords and that many people's communes in China had such large farm tools, they exclaimed in surprise, "Achcha!" "Achcha!" (Good!). Various small agricultural tools created by Chinese farmers themselves were one of the characteristics of this World Agricultural Fair. Whether they were Indian farmers or agricultural technicians, they all praised these tools with delight when they saw them. They believed that these small agricultural tools, which were simple to make, easy to use, and could greatly reduce physical labor, were the most practical for India today. Next to a wooden and an iron rice transplanter, there were often crowds of people, and some people even drew pictures and took photos of these tools. Some Western capitalist journalists also came here to take pictures, and they could not help but admire the wisdom and creativity of Chinese farmers. Some Western journalists wanted to find the news material they needed from the exhibited Jiefang (Liberation) brand trucks and Dongfanghong (East is Red) brand tractors. They came again and again to carefully observe their parts, instruments, and tires... attempting to gather even a little bit of evidence to prove that the Chinese people were not yet capable of manufacturing such things today. But their repeated trips could only be a waste of effort.

The exhibition of the China Pavilion in New Delhi not only enabled the Chinese and Indian people to have the opportunity to exchange many agricultural technical experiences, but more importantly, it promoted mutual understanding between the two peoples and consolidated and enhanced their friendship. The Indian people who came to visit the China Pavilion wrote many, many things they wanted to say in their hearts in the visitors' book every day. They were happy for the construction achievements of their neighboring country, and they also expressed their sincere friendship with the Chinese people. They said that they saw "great miracles," "amazing achievements," and "examples of self-reliance" in the China Pavilion. They praised China as "a brilliant example of human progress" and "the glory of Asia." Some viewers said, "I have come to this pavilion eight times, but I am still not satisfied," "Thank you very much, Chinese brothers, you have pointed out the secret to increasing agricultural output to us." An old man from Rajasthan with graying temples wrote more simply and piously: "I pray to God to give Mr. Mao Zedong longevity and good health. He gave the Chinese people freedom, and he brought great prestige to the name of the Chinese Communist Party!" Many Indian visitors often asked the Chinese to give them autographs and take photos together, congratulate the Chinese people on the New Year in the visitors' book, and even leave their addresses to request communication. A researcher from the Jute Research Institute in Calcutta, after discussing agricultural production issues with Yan Ji, a Chinese rice expert, requested that Yan Ji write to him in advance if he passed through Calcutta in the future so that he could go to meet him and accompany him to visit various places. The Pusa Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi also specially invited Yan Ji to give a special lecture on the cultivation of double-cropping rice and multiple cropping systems in the Yangtze River basin of China.

This is the evaluation of New China by the Indian people today and what they want to say to the Chinese people. Such examples are not isolated. We have counted all 4,400 comments written by viewers in the visitors' book during the first 20 days of the China Pavilion's opening, and the vast majority of them praised the China Exhibition Hall and the construction achievements of New China.

As early as during the construction of the China Pavilion, the broad masses of the Indian people, especially the Indian workers, expressed a very friendly attitude towards the Chinese people. They actively supported the China Pavilion. The China Pavilion started the latest and the preparation time was very short. When the ships transporting Chinese exhibits arrived at the port of Calcutta, the dock workers helped to unload them at the fastest speed so that they could be quickly transported to New Delhi. They were all happy to see Chinese-made agricultural machinery for the first time. Immediately afterwards, the construction workers in Delhi helped to build and decorate an exhibition hall with Chinese national style in a short period of time, so that the China Pavilion could open on schedule.

However, the reactionary elements in India did not like to see the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people develop through this exhibition. Before the opening ceremony of the World Agricultural Fair, there were some incidents of throwing stones at the China Pavilion. Reactionary elements have also repeatedly carried out sabotage activities in the China Exhibition Hall. This caused dissatisfaction among many Indian viewers, who condemned and demanded an end to this sabotage. In the visitors' book, people can see point-for-point rebuttals to those opinions that are hostile to China. For example, on December 27th last year, a viewer named "A Journalist" wrote after two comments cursing China: "When I read these comments, I was very surprised and ashamed. A country and people that have achieved such great achievements, as shown in the exhibition hall, need more sympathy and better treatment from us Indian people who have suffered cruel oppression from imperialism. It is inappropriate to describe a country that is engaged in construction here like this. I believe and hope that the friendly Chinese people will not pay attention to these. Let the ancient friendship between these two great Asian countries be restored, and let imperialism die!"

The World Agricultural Fair is still being held in New Delhi. The national flags of China and India are flying side by side high above the entrance of the China Exhibition Hall, and the open vermilion gate of the Chinese palace-style building continues to receive the people of our neighboring country, India, every day. Many Indians compare this China Pavilion in New Delhi to "a symbol of Sino-Indian friendship." Every day, as the endless stream of people enter and exit the hall of the China Pavilion, everyone pays special attention to the two huge photographs of Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou Enlai hanging in front of them. One picture shows the grand occasion of Beijing citizens welcoming Prime Minister Nehru's visit to China, and the other picture shows the Indian people presenting Premier Zhou Enlai with garlands when he arrived at New Delhi Airport. Indian friends enthusiastically wrote in the visitors' book: "Despite what people are saying about the relationship between our two great countries, I feel that the solidarity between India and China is a cornerstone on which there can be Asian solidarity and world peace."

"India and China are brothers, let us always get along like brothers and sisters!" This heartfelt wish from the Indian people is undoubtedly the common hope of the more than 600 million Chinese people as well. (Attached pictures)

    印度人民的声音
    ——新德里世界农业博览会中国馆见闻
    本报记者　屠培林
    去年12月11日在新德里开幕的世界农业博览会，除了印度中央政府和各省邦所设的展览馆外，苏联、中国、德意志民主共和国、波兰、蒙古、缅甸、伊拉克、阿富汗、锡兰、伊朗和美国等十二个国家，也应邀参加了展出。中国馆的展出面积达七万多平方英尺，是这次博览会中最大的展览馆之一。从开幕以来，印度各阶层人民每天都川流不息地涌向中国馆来。到现在还不过一个半月的时间，中国馆已经接待了一百万以上的参观者。逢到星期日和假日的时候，中国馆每分钟要接待一、二百参观者。印度总统普拉沙德、副总统拉达克里希南、人民院议长阿延加尔以及印度中央政府的许多部长、议员和省邦的高级官员也都来参观了中国馆。不论是从遥远的阿萨姆或南印度马德拉斯来的农民，还是从加尔各答、孟买和比哈尔来的农业科学研究人员，或是德里的职员、青年学生和市民，他们都非常关切地想知道新中国的人民公社和经济建设情况，了解中国农业生产的跃进成就和具体增产经验。
    人们从展览馆中了解到了他们想知道的东西。大幅的照片、图表、电动模型和丰富的实物，系统地向参观者介绍了新中国十年来农业生产建设的成就，以及林业、畜牧业、水产业和人民公社工业等发展情况。中国展览馆中的水稻、小麦、杂粮、畜牧等方面的专家和四川省新繁县新民人民公社社长罗世发、河南省遂平县嵖岈山人民公社社长陈丙寅、河北省定县韩家洼人民公社社长马宝山和上海市彭浦人民公社谈桥生产队的周小妹，每天都在展览馆里热情地接待观众，并解答人们所提出的各种各样的问题，还同印度农民和专家相互交流农业生产上的经验。印度朋友对当前我国农业增产的法宝——农业“八字宪法”和人民公社的介绍，感到极大的兴趣。他们怀着惊奇而又感动的神情，倾听着中国怎样解决粮食问题和什么叫吃饭不要钱。在展览馆里高大而结实累累的棉株，穗大的水稻、小麦和玉米、抬头仰望有三人高的高粱……以及说明兴修水利、绿化造林、改造洼地、引水上山、保持水土和发展农村水电站等各种各样的电动模型前面……经常围满了密密层层的参观人群。他们拿着纸笔认真地记下讲解员的说明，并详细地抄录了说明牌上的具体增产措施。每天还有很多很多参观者向中国馆索取良种和技术资料。虽然现在新德里晚上的天气也相当冷，但中国馆的露天电影场上却每晚都挤满了观众。
    展览馆的室外广场上陈列着中国制的大型拖拉机、联合收割机、载重汽车和排灌工具。一群从旁遮普来的老年农民，询问站在联合收割机驾驶台上的北京农业机械厂工人高凤祥说：“这些大农具是不是地主的？”当他们听说不是地主的，在中国很多人民公社都置有这样的大农具时，他们惊奇的连声说：“阿恰！”“阿恰！”（好！）新中国农民自己创造的各种小型农具，是这次世界农业博览会的特色之一。不论是印度的农民还是农业技术人员，看到这些农具后，无不喜爱地连声称赞。他们认为，这些制作简单、使用方便而又能大大减轻体力劳动的小型农具，对今天的印度最实用。在一架木制的和一架铁制的水稻插秧机旁边，经常围满人群，有些人还把这种农具描绘下图样和拍成照片。一些西方资本主义国家记者也跑来这里拍照，他们不能不佩服新中国农民的智慧和创造性。有些西方记者却想从展出的解放牌汽车和东方红牌拖拉机上寻找他们需要的报道题材，他们一次又一次地前来仔细观察它们的机件、仪表和轮胎……企图能搜罗到一星半点证据来证明中国人民今天还没有能力制造出这种东西。但他们一再往返，结果只能是枉费心机而已。
    中国展览馆在新德里的展出，不仅使中国人民同印度人民能有机会交流许多农业技术经验，更重要的是促进了两国人民的相互了解，并巩固和增进了彼此间的友谊。前来中国馆参观的印度人民，每天在观众留言簿上写下了许多许多他们心里要说的话。他们为自己邻邦的建设成就而高兴，他们也倾诉了对中国人民真挚的友情。他们说在中国馆看到了“伟大的奇迹”、“惊人的成就”和“自力更生的范例”。他们赞扬中国是“人类前进的一个光辉榜样”，是“亚洲的光荣”。有的观众说：“我已经来这个馆看了八遍，但仍不满足”，“非常感谢中国兄弟，你们给我们指出了提高农业产量的秘诀”。一位从拉贾斯坦来的鬓发已白的老人更朴实而虔诚地写道：“我祈告上帝，让毛泽东先生长寿，身体健康。他使中国人民得到了自由，他带给中国共产党这个名字以很高的威望！”很多印度参观者还常常要求中国人给他们签名和一起拍照，在留言簿上向中国人民祝贺新年，甚至留下自己的地址要求交往通信。一位加尔各答黄麻研究所的研究员同我国水稻专家颜济交谈了农业生产上的问题后，要求颜济在今后路经加尔各答时，一定先写信告诉他，以便他能前往迎接并陪同到各处参观。新德里普沙农业研究院还特地邀请颜济去他们那里作了一次关于中国长江流域双季稻的栽培和多熟制的专题讲演。
    这就是今天印度人民对新中国的评价和对中国人民要说的话。这样的例子并不是个别的。我们统计了一下，中国馆开幕头二十天中观众在留言簿上写下的全部四千四百条意见，其中绝大多数是赞扬中国展览馆和新中国的建设成就的。
    早在中国馆筹建期间，印度广大人民，特别是印度工人就对中国人民表示了十分友好的态度。他们对中国馆积极加以支持。中国馆动手最晚，筹备时间十分仓促。加尔各答的码头工人在运送中国展览品的船只到达港口时，就以最快的速度帮助起卸，以便能迅速运往新德里。他们都为第一次见到中国自制的农业机械感到高兴。德里的建筑工人紧接着在短短的日子里，又帮助把一座具有中国民族风格的展览馆修建装饰起来，使中国馆能如期开幕。
    但是，印度的反动分子不喜欢看到中印两国人民的友谊，通过这次展览会得到发展。在世界农业博览会举行开幕式以前，发生了一些对中国馆投掷石头的事件。反动分子还一再在中国展览馆内进行破坏活动。这引起了许多印度观众的不满，他们指责和要求制止这种破坏活动。在观众留言簿上，人们可以看到对那些敌视中国的意见的针锋相对的回击。例如，去年12月27日，有一位署名“一个记者”的观众，紧接在两条咒骂中国的意见后面写道：“当我看了这些意见后，我很惊奇，也很惭愧。一个取得了这样大的成就的国家和人民，就像展览馆内展出的那样，需要我们曾受过帝国主义残酷压迫的印度人民的更多同情和更好的对待。在这里这样描写一个正在从事建设的国家是不适当的。我相信和希望友好的中国人民不会理睬这些。让我们这两个亚洲伟大国家之间的古老友谊得到恢复，让帝国主义死亡！”
    世界农业博览会现在还在新德里继续举行。中国展览馆门前上空并排高高飘悬着中印两国的国旗，敞开着的中国宫殿式的朱红大门每天继续在接待着我们邻邦印度的人民。许多印度人把在新德里的这个中国馆比喻是“印中友谊的象征”。每天，当川流不息的人群进进出出中国馆的大厅时，每个人都特别注意到高悬在面前的两幅巨大的尼赫鲁总理和周恩来总理合影的照片，这边一幅是北京市民夹道欢迎尼赫鲁总理去中国访问的盛况，那边一幅是周恩来总理抵达新德里机场时，印度人民给他献上了花环。印度朋友们在留言簿上热情地写道：“尽管人们关于我们这两个伟大国家的关系在说些什么，我觉得印度和中国的团结关系是一个基石，在这上面才能有亚洲的团结和世界的和平”。
    “印度中国是兄弟，让我们永远像兄弟姊妹般地相处吧！”印度人民发自衷心的这一祝愿，无疑的，也是六亿多中国人民的共同希望。（附图片）
