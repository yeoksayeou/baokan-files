Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 2nd: The workers of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant overfulfilled their production value plan by 145% on January 1st. The output exceeded the highest daily output in December by over 117%, all products were of qualified quality, and safe production was achieved.

　　Throughout the day, from the start of work in the morning until the evening, the broadcasting loudspeakers in each workshop of the Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant continuously broadcasted the production success stories of various work sections, groups, and workers. By 4:00 PM, a total of 1,226 workers in the plant had completed two days' worth of work, and eight workers had completed ten days' worth of work.

　　The quick report blackboards in each workshop also continuously published news of improved operating methods, innovative tool cards, and increased production efficiency. It is estimated that the plant's employees implemented a total of 43 technical innovation proposals that day.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 2nd: The workers of the Harbin Bearing Plant, who had comprehensively overfulfilled the 1959 state plan one month ahead of schedule, also achieved a successful start to the new year. On January 1st and 2nd, the average daily output of the entire plant exceeded the planned target by 49%, and increased by one time compared with the average daily output in December 1959. The product qualification rate increased from 97% in December last year to 99%.

　　In order to ensure a "red" start to production in 1960, this factory mobilized its employees to discuss the first quarter plan before the New Year and formulated measures to complete the task. On New Year's Day, the Party Secretary, the Factory Director, and the leading cadres of the Party, government, labor union, and the Communist Youth League in various workshops personally went to the front line, labored alongside the workers, and helped solve problems in production, which greatly enhanced the morale of the workers. A surge of innovation and creativity quickly emerged throughout the factory. In the two days of January 1st and 2nd, the factory implemented 89 technical reforms, increasing production efficiency by 20% to 65 times respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, January 1st: From 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM today, the Luoyang First Tractor Plant assembled a total of 30 "Dongfanghong" tractors, setting a new record of assembling one tractor every ten minutes.

　　Fully preparing for production was the main reason for this factory's successful start. By the eve of New Year's Day, the plant's employees had prepared nearly a thousand tractors' worth of semi-finished products in reserve, and also modified 600 tons of pipes and rods. In addition, they smelted more than 200 tons of alloy steel themselves.

　　Today, the plant's employees deeply carried out the technical innovation movement, breaking through many weak links in production.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 2nd: The Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant achieved a "red" start to production on January 1st. All eleven workshops in the plant overfulfilled their daily plans. The total output value exceeded the plan by 68.2%, an increase of 156.1% compared with the average daily output value of the previous month.

　　The plant's employees were full of enthusiasm. On this day, all employees of the plant went to work early. The electric furnace section of the steelmaking workshop produced the first furnace of molten steel as early as 5:00 AM, casting the first large part produced in 1960. On this day, the plant's employees put forward more than 500 rationalization proposals and implemented more than 200.

    新年技术革新旗开得胜
    洛阳拖拉机厂矿山机器厂元旦全面红
    据新华社哈尔滨2日电　哈尔滨量具刃具厂职工1日超额145％完成了产值计划，产量比12月份最高日产量超过117％，产品质量全部合格，并且作到了安全生产。
    这一天，从早晨上班后直到晚间，量具刃具厂各个车间的广播喇叭不断地播送着各工段小组和工人的生产喜讯。到下午四时，全厂已经有一千二百二十六人完成了两天的工作量，有八个人完成了十天的工作量。
    各车间的快报黑板报上也不断刊登出改进操作方法、革新工具卡、提高生产效率的捷报。据统计全厂职工这一天共实现技术革新建议四十三项。
    据新华社哈尔滨2日电　提前一个月全面超额完成1959年国家计划的哈尔滨轴承厂职工，今年又夺得了开门满堂红。1、2两日全厂平均日产量超过预定计划49％，比1959年12月份的平均日产量增长一倍，产品合格率由去年12月份的97％提高到99％。
    为了保证实现1960年的生产开门红，这个工厂在年前就发动职工讨论了今年第一季度计划，制订了完成任务的措施。元旦这天，厂党委书记、厂长和各车间党政工团领导干部都亲自深入第一线，边劳动边帮助解决生产中的问题，大大增强了职工斗志，全厂迅速出现了人人闹革新、个个搞创造的热潮，1、2日两天中全厂就实现了技术改革八十九项，使生产效率分别提高20％到六十五倍。
    据新华社洛阳1日电　洛阳第一拖拉机厂在今天上午七时到十二时，共装配“东方红”拖拉机三十台，创造了每十分钟装配一台拖拉机的新纪录。
    充分作好生产准备工作，是这个厂取得开门红的主要原因。全厂职工到元旦前夕已经准备好近千台拖拉机再制品储备量，另外还改制了六百吨管材和棒材。此外自己炼了二百多吨合金钢。
    这个厂的职工今天深入地开展了技术革新运动，突破了生产中的许多薄弱环节。
    据新华社郑州2日电　洛阳矿山机器厂在1月1日实现了生产开门红。全厂十一个车间都超额完成了日计划。总产值超额68．2％，比上月平均日产值增加156．1％。
    这个厂的职工，干劲很足，这一天，全厂职工都提前上了班。炼钢车间电炉工段在早晨五点多钟就炼出了第一炉钢水，浇铸了1960年生产的第一个大型零件。这一天，全厂职工共提出合理化建议五百多条，实现了二百多条。
