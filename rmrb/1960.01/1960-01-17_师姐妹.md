    Sister Apprentices

    Today's meeting is still about technical innovation. Team leader Master Jin went over the team's "key point" again, but no one spoke up for the time being. Only old Master Qian was puffing away at his pipe.
      "Can I say something?" I fiddled with the end of my braid, looking expectantly at Master Jin.
      "Go ahead, Xiao Qin." So I explained my idea for a "live gate" drilling tool to everyone, adding a few gestures for clarity, fearing I wouldn't be able to explain it well enough.
    Still, no one spoke. Clearly, everyone was pondering it. I thought, this might work.
      "I think Qin Shulan's idea for the drilling tool makes sense in principle," my sister apprentice Wang Wei said. She's two years older than me, and we both joined the factory last year. She's a member of the Communist Youth League, tall with a round face, and doesn't usually talk much. If we weren't occasionally arguing, we'd be getting along pretty well. After a moment of consideration, she added:
      "According to Qin Shulan's idea, we'd have to make a new drilling tool—drawing blueprints, making a model, sand casting, and machining would take at least half a month. That won't work. The 'live gate' task is urgent, and time is limited. If the experiment fails, it will waste a lot of the country's money! It would be best to think of another way..."
      "Wang Wei is right," Old Master Qian agreed with her. He added that seizing the task was crucial, and that half a month later it would be 1960. We must not let the "key point" cross into the new year.
    Heavens, wasn't Wang Wei deliberately opposing me! Doesn't she realize how much production efficiency a successful new drill could improve? And she's the senior apprentice!
    Everyone agreed with Wang Wei's opinion. It was infuriating. After the meeting, I returned to the dormitory, too angry to eat.
      ★　★　★
    At ten o'clock that night, I was the only one in the dormitory. The people on the night shift had just left, but Wang Wei hadn't returned yet. Where did she go? For some reason, I was hoping she would come back soon, unable to say whether it was longing or resentment. I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling, thinking about the meeting.
    Suddenly the door opened, and Wang Wei ran in, panting, covered in dirt, her face red with cold. While brushing the snow off her body, she happily shouted:
      "Get up quickly, Xiao Qin, I have good news for you! I spent three and a half hours searching the scrap pile, and I found it, I found it! There's an old tire mold that can be modified to make a drilling tool, just like you said at the meeting! Get up quickly, let's carry it to the workshop. Master Jin will be happy to see it tomorrow. I was afraid I wouldn't find it, so I didn't tell you beforehand."
    I jumped out of bed in a flash, quickly put on my clothes, and wrapped a scarf around my sister apprentice. Together we left the dormitory, and I took my sister apprentice's hand as we ran towards the scrap pile in the swirling snowflakes...

    今天开会还是技术革新的事，组长金师傅把小组的“关键”说了一遍，暂时没人发言，只有钱老师傅吱啦吱啦地吸着烟斗。
      “我说点可以吗？”我的手摆弄着辫子梢儿，眼巴巴地望着金师傅。
      “说吧，小秦。”我就把我想的那个“活门”打眼钻具，向大家说了一遍，恐怕说不明白，还加了几个手势。
    这时仍然没人发言，显然大家都在琢磨。我心想，有门道，也许能行。
      “秦淑兰想的钻具，我认为在道理上讲得通。”我的师姐王薇说话了。她比我大两岁，我们都是去年进厂的，她是个团员，高高的个儿，圆圆的脸，平时不大爱说话。我们俩如果不是间或顶嘴的话，还算很不错。她考虑了一会，又说道：
      “按着秦淑兰的说法，得做个新钻具——画图纸、做模型、翻砂、加工都算上至少半个月才能做出来，不行，‘活门’任务急，时间不允许。如果试验不成，要给国家浪费好多钱！最好想别的办法……。”
      “王薇说的有理。”钱老师傅同意他的说法。还说抢任务要紧，半个月以后就是1960年。决不让“关键”过年。
    天哪，王薇说那话不是存心和我作对吗！她怎么不想想，新钻具成功后能提高多少生产效率，她还是师姐哪。
    大家都同意王薇的意见，真气死人，散会后我回到宿舍，不吃饭都气饱了。
      ★　★　★
    晚上十点钟，宿舍里只有我一个人，上夜班的刚走，王薇却一直没回来，上哪儿去了呢？不知怎的，这时我希望她快点回来，说不出是想还是恨。我脸冲顶棚躺在床上，心里想着开会的事。
    忽然门开了，王薇跑进来，气喘呼呼，浑身是土，脸冻得红红的，一边掸着身上雪，一边高兴地喊道：
      “快起来呀，小秦，告诉你个好消息，我在废料堆找了三个半钟头，找着啦，找着啦，有个旧胎具，可以改做钻具，就像你开会时说的那样，快起来，咱们把它抬到车间，明天金师傅看见一定高兴。我怕找不着，事先没告诉你。”
    我一个滚儿爬起来，急忙穿好衣服，给师姐围上围巾；我们一同走出宿舍，我拉着师姐的手，迎着漫天飞舞的雪花，一直向废料堆跑去……。
