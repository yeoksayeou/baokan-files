Beware of the Arsonists of the Pentagon
By Our Commentator

    According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on January 18, U.S. diplomats are openly clamoring that the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc "is prepared with plans to deal with any eventuality that might occur (in Laos)," and that "Britain and the United States, as the main members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, will of course play their part in this collective defense system." According to the United Press International dispatch on the same day, an American official said, "It is almost certain that the United States and Britain will send troops to Laos." Meanwhile, the magazine "U.S. News & World Report" also spread the news that the United States and Britain have reached a secret agreement to "airlift troops to Laos." "Detailed plans are currently being actively drawn up in the Pentagon in Washington and the Ministry of Defence in London... The Anglo-American 'police force' can enter Laos upon notification," and it even said that it would use "methods of attacking mainland China," and even "the possibility of using nuclear weapons in such an action is not ruled out," and so on.

    This naked war clamor from Washington clearly increases the danger of the current situation in Laos. As everyone knows, not long ago, the U.S. ruling clique created a military coup in Laos, supporting the extremely reactionary "Committee for the Defence of National Interests" to seize power, so that it could further directly control Laos. Even the British bourgeois newspaper "The Guardian" believes that the new government of Laos "will rule according to the wishes of the generals and the wishes of the 'Committee for the Defence of National Interests' associated with them." And this "is sad for the prospects of peace" in Laos and Indochina. Recently, Sisouk Na Champassak, one of the leaders of the pro-American Lao warlord group "Committee for the Defence of National Interests," was still clamoring for "continuing to resolutely oppose the policy of easing the situation" and to completely change the "content" and "form" of the Lao constitution and the National Assembly. It can be seen that U.S. imperialism and the reactionary warlords of Laos are stepping up the establishment of a military dictatorship in Laos and further thoroughly undermining the Geneva Accords in order to block the road to restoring peace in Laos. Is it a mere coincidence that Washington is clamoring for military intervention in the Lao situation at this time?

    As with the tactics that U.S. imperialism has always used, this time the U.S. ruling clique is still waving the tattered black flag of so-called opposition to "communist aggression" and "communist offensive." But the entire course of development of the Lao situation has thoroughly exposed the true face of the arsonists of the Pentagon. More than half a year ago, U.S. aggressors instigated the pro-American group in Laos to ignite the first fire of the Lao civil war, causing serious damage to the Geneva Accords and Lao peace. At that time, U.S. imperialism was also engaging in arson activities in Laos in the name of "anti-communism." And the facts have proven that there is indeed "aggression" and "threats" from foreign countries in Laos, and that foreign country is precisely U.S. imperialism.

    Of course, the current activities of the U.S. ruling clique to vigorously create a dangerous situation in Laos are inseparable from a series of conspiracies it has recently carried out in the Far East to intensify tensions and step up preparations for war. U.S. imperialism signed the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty with the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government on January 19, aimed at antagonizing the people of China and the Soviet Union and threatening peace in the Far East. U.S. imperialism is also actively piecing together a Northeast Asian military bloc with the Chiang Kai-shek clique participating. Recently, Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam's activities in Taiwan show that South Vietnam and the Chiang Kai-shek clique are further colluding under the auspices of their American masters, threatening peace in the Far East. The U.S. propaganda machine is even clamoring to "attack mainland China" and "use nuclear weapons" against China. The U.S. ruling clique's trick of playing fake peace and real war preparations has been completely exposed to the people of the world.

    The Chinese people have always believed that the Lao issue must be resolved in accordance with the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements; and the main task at present is to eliminate the tense situation in Laos created by U.S. imperialism and restore peace in Laos. Therefore, the Chinese people will, together with all peace-loving countries and people in Southeast Asia and the world, resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's adventurous activities to further expand the Lao war and threaten peace in Asia and the world.

    警惕五角大楼的纵火犯
    本报评论员
    据路透社1月18日发自华盛顿的电讯报道，美国外交人士公然叫嚷说：东南亚侵略集团“已经准备好（在老挝）对付可能发生的任何意外事件的计划”，而“作为东南亚条约组织的主要成员的英国和美国当然将起它们在这个集体防御体系里的作用”。另据合众国际社的同一天电讯透露，一个美国官员说：“美国和英国派兵到老挝几乎是肯定的”。同时“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志也传出消息说，美国和英国已经达成一项“把军队空运到老挝去”的秘密协议”。“目前在华盛顿五角大楼和伦敦的国防部正在积极地制订详细的计划……英美的‘警察部队’一接到通知就可以开入老挝”，并且还说要用“袭击中国大陆的办法”，甚至“没有排斥在这样一种行动中使用核武器的可能性”云云。
    华盛顿的这种赤裸裸的战争叫嚣，显然增加了当前老挝局势的危险性。大家知道，不久以前美国统治集团制造了老挝的军事政变，扶植极端反动的“保卫国家利益委员会”攫夺了政权，以便它进一步直接控制老挝。连英国资产阶级报纸“卫报”也认为，老挝的新政府“将根据将军们的愿望和与他们有联系的‘保卫国家利益委员会’的愿望进行统治”。而这对老挝和印度支那的“和平前景来说是可悲的”。最近极端亲美的老挝军阀集团“保卫国家利益委员会”的首领之一西苏·纳占巴萨还在叫嚷“继续坚决反对缓和局势的政策”，并且要完全改变老挝宪法和国会的“内容”和“形式”。由此可见，美国帝国主义和老挝的反动军阀正在加紧进行着建立老挝军事独裁和进一步彻底破坏日内瓦协议，以堵塞恢复老挝和平的道路。正在这个时候，华盛顿方面大叫大喊要对老挝局势实行军事干涉，岂是偶然的巧合吗？
    和过去美帝国主义所惯用的手法一样，这一次美国统治集团仍然打着所谓反对“共产党侵略”、“共产党人进攻”的破烂的黑旗。但是老挝局势的整个发展过程已经彻头彻尾地揭露了五角大楼纵火犯的真面目。半年多以前，美国侵略者指使老挝亲美集团燃起了老挝内战的第一把火，使日内瓦协议和老挝和平遭到严重破坏。那个时候，美国帝国主义也是假“反共”之名而在老挝进行放火活动的。而事实已经证明，在老挝的确有来自外国的“侵略”和“威胁”，这个外国恰恰就是美国帝国主义。
    当然，美国统治集团目前竭力制造老挝危险局势的活动，是同它最近在远东进行的一系列加剧紧张局势和加紧备战的阴谋分不开的。美国帝国主义已于1月19日同日本岸信介政府签订了旨在敌视中、苏两国人民和威胁远东和平的侵略性的日美军事同盟条约。美国帝国主义还在积极拼凑有蒋介石集团参加的东北亚军事集团。最近南越吴庭艳到台湾活动，表明南越和蒋介石集团正在它们的美国主子撮合下进一步勾结起来，威胁远东和平。美国宣传机器甚至已经在叫嚷要“袭击中国大陆”和对中国“使用核武器”了。美国统治集团玩弄的假和平、真备战的把戏已经在全世界人民面前暴露无遗了。
    中国人民一贯认为，老挝问题必须遵循日内瓦协议和万象协议来解决；而目前主要的任务，是消除美帝国主义制造的老挝紧张局势，恢复老挝的和平。因此，中国人民将同东南亚和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起，坚决反对美帝国主义进一步扩大老挝战火、威胁亚洲和世界和平的冒险活动。
