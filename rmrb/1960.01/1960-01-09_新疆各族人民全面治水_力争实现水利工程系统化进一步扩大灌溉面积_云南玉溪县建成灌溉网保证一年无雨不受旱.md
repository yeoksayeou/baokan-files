    Urumqi, January 8th (People's Daily) - The water conservancy army fighting on water conservancy construction sites throughout the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, braving the severe cold of minus 20 to 30 degrees Celsius, is dividing into three routes, striving to systematize water conservancy projects.

    The systematization of water conservancy projects in Xinjiang includes the following aspects: changing natural riverbeds with severe leakage and loss into artificial large canals; constructing dams, water intake, drainage, and flood discharge gates upstream of the river channels to control river water leakage, loss, and erosion; building a number of large, medium, and small reservoirs in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of each river to intercept summer floods and winter idle water, playing a role in supplementing and regulating water use; reforming the irregular canals in existing irrigation areas, installing water diversion gates and water pipelines, leveling land, so that canals become systematic and land becomes connected, improving water utilization rate, and creating conditions for mechanized farming and preventing soil salinization.

    For many years, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have relied on snowmelt from the mountains to irrigate crops. However, the amount of water is very small when crops need water in the spring, and floods often occur in July and August. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups have been building water conservancy projects year after year, which has basically changed the original irrigation situation and expanded the irrigated area by more than 20 million mu. After the people's communes were established, Xinjiang's water conservancy construction entered a new stage combining river management, reservoir construction, and old canal reconstruction. The water loss of rivers after reconstruction has been reduced by half compared to before; reconstructing channels at all levels in the old irrigation area and leveling cultivated land have not only increased the number of irrigations but also expanded the irrigated area. In order to meet the needs of agricultural production development, a water management policy was put forward to further combine large, medium, and small projects, take into account both new and old projects, gradually realize the systematization of water conservancy projects, improve the level of water conservancy, and expand the irrigated area.

    In order to realize the systematization of water conservancy projects as soon as possible, the four artificial large canals and canal head projects built in Kashgar Prefecture in southern Xinjiang strive to divert river water into the large canals before the spring plowing this year. In northern Xinjiang, the Urumqi River will be transformed into an artificially controlled large canal this spring to realize engineering systematization, so as to meet the needs of irrigation, industry, afforestation, and urban water use in Urumqi.

    The people's communes have also drawn a large number of laborers to renovate the canals at all levels in the original irrigation area and level the land, so that the above-mentioned large and medium-sized projects and the canals at all levels are all connected. By December 15, Tacheng Prefecture had overfulfilled the 1960 plan to renovate 400,000 mu of old irrigation areas. Shule and Yingjisha counties have basically formed a new irrigation network with connected land and well-developed channels.

    At present, a high-efficiency and high-quality upsurge in water conservancy construction has been formed. By December 23, the entire region had completed 50% of the water conservancy construction plan.

    Xinhua News Agency, Yunnan, January 8th. Yuxi County in Yunnan Province has built a "long vine bearing melons" style water conservancy irrigation network, so that a single rainfall of 200 millimeters will not cause disaster, and there will be no drought even without rain for a year.

    From 1954 to 1956, Yuxi County built a 39-kilometer-long "long vine bearing melons" style self-flowing irrigation network, expanding the irrigation area of paddy fields in the county from more than 5,000 mu to more than 45,000 mu.

    With the development of production, this primary water conservancy irrigation network could no longer meet the needs. The Yuxi County Party Committee, with the spirit of continuous revolution, based on the natural characteristics of the county's high mountains in the surrounding areas and low-lying areas in the middle, decided to build a group of small and medium-sized reservoirs upstream of the valleys around the county, and move the "long vine bearing melons" to the mountains, so as to fundamentally control floods and ensure self-flowing irrigation of all cultivated land. After two years of hard work, the plan was realized. At the beginning of the spring plowing in 1959, 23 small and medium-sized reservoirs with a water storage capacity of between one million and 25 million cubic meters had been built in the valleys within the territory, and the capacity to control water volume had reached more than 100 million cubic meters. Despite the scarcity of rainfall, the county planted rice seedlings for the first time during the most suitable season for planting.

    In the winter of 1959, the Yuxi County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the task of building an advanced water conservancy network that fundamentally eliminates drought and flood disasters. Starting in November, the county party committee organized nearly 30,000 laborers to continue building the Dongfeng Reservoir, which started in 1958 and has a storage capacity of 120 million cubic meters, and to build 22 medium and small-sized trunk canals with a total length of 235 kilometers. At present, a 45-kilometer-long Dongfeng Ditch with a flow rate of 5 cubic meters per second has been initially built; the Dongfeng Reservoir, which can be used for comprehensive utilization such as irrigation, water storage, shipping, fish farming, and power generation, has also completed more than 70% of the project. Up to this point, one large self-flowing irrigation network and four small self-flowing irrigation networks have been formed throughout the county. The controlled water volume of these water systems can reach about 300 million cubic meters. The largest Yuxi irrigation network has surrounded most of the county, including six communes, forming a circulating large reservoir group. This reservoir group is connected to 909 large, medium, and small reservoirs through trunk canals, with a total controlled water volume of more than 174.2 million square meters. Outside this large water conservancy network, four people's communes have independently built small self-flowing irrigation networks, each of which is connected to 70 to 550 medium and small-sized reservoirs through trunk canals, with controlled water volumes ranging from 7.1 million cubic meters to 23.8 million cubic meters respectively. The trunk canals and branch canals of these five large and small water systems are more than 1,000 kilometers long. After all the projects are filled with water, not only can the water volume be adjusted between reservoirs, but also the water volume can be adjusted between years, so that each of the 250,000 mu of paddy fields in the county has about 1,000 cubic meters of water, and each of the 110,000 mu of irrigated land has an average of more than 400 cubic meters of water. No matter in mountainous areas or dam areas, it can be guaranteed that the county will not run out of water even if there is no rain for a year, and a single rainfall of 200 millimeters will not cause flooding.

    Since the water flow is large after the reservoir gate is opened, the entire irrigation area must release water at a unified time. However, the harvesting and planting times of crops in each commune, management area, and production team are different, and the arrangement of labor and livestock and the progress of deep plowing, fertilization, and soil drying are inconsistent. The unified water release of the irrigation system causes passive situations in spring plowing production. Therefore, the county party committee decided to turn the hundreds of ponds established earlier into temporary water distribution stations, and input the water needed by the communes and management areas from the reservoirs into the water distribution stations more than half a month in advance, so that each commune and management area can irrigate in a timely manner according to their own arrangements. The advantages of this water distribution station are: it does not occupy cultivated land area, and generally starts to store water after the winter crops are harvested, and can plant rice after flood release. The water distribution station has a large area and shallow water storage, which can play a role in drying the water and raising the water temperature; at the same time, the water distribution station can adjust inventory. After the large reservoir transports water to the water distribution station, it can continue to store water, improving water storage and flood control capabilities; this water distribution station can also strengthen the sense of responsibility of water users, facilitate unified management, and also facilitate water conservation.

    新疆各族人民全面治水
    力争实现水利工程系统化进一步扩大灌溉面积
    云南玉溪县建成灌溉网保证一年无雨不受旱
    本报乌鲁木齐8日电　奋战在天山南北各水利工地上的水利大军，冒着摄氏零下二、三十度的严寒，兵分三路，力争实现水利工程系统化。
    新疆水利工程系统化，包括以下几个方面：即改渗漏流失严重的天然河床为人工大渠，在河道上游建筑拦河大坝、进水、泄水、分洪闸等设备，控制河水渗漏流失和冲刷现象；在各条河的上、中、下游，兴建一批大、中、小型水库，拦蓄夏季洪水和冬闲水，起补充和调节用水的作用；改建现有灌区中不规则的渠道，安装分水闸和输水管，平整土地，使渠道成系、土地连片，提高水的利用率，为实行机耕、防止土壤盐碱化创造条件。
    新疆各族人民多年依靠山上融化的雪水灌溉庄稼。但在春季庄稼需要水时水量很少，7、8月间又常常发生洪水为患。解放后，各族人民在党的领导下，年年兴修水利，已基本上改变了原来的灌溉状况，并扩大了二千多万亩灌溉面积。人民公社化以后，新疆的水利建设跨进一个治理河流、兴建水库和改建旧渠相结合的新阶段。经过改道的河流，河水的流失量都比以前减少了一半；改建旧灌区内各级渠道，平整耕地，不仅增加了灌溉次数，并扩大了灌溉面积。适应农业生产发展的需要，提出了进一步使大、中、小型工程并举，新旧工程兼顾，逐步实现水利工程系统化，提高水利化标准，扩大灌溉面积的治水方针。
    为了尽快实现水利工程系统化，南疆喀什专区修建的四条人工大渠和渠首工程，力争在今年春耕前将河水引至大渠里。在北疆今年春天就将使乌鲁木齐河变成一条人工控制的大渠，实现工程系统化，以满足乌鲁木齐市灌溉、工业、绿化、市民用水的需要。
    各人民公社还抽出大批劳力，整修原有灌区内的各级渠道，平整土地，使以上的大、中型工程和各级渠道全部连结起来。到12月15日，塔城专区已超额完成了1960年改建四十万亩旧灌区的计划。疏勒和英吉沙县，已基本上形成土地连片、渠道四通八达的新的灌溉网。
    目前，一个高工效、高质量的兴修水利高潮已经形成了，到12月23日，全区已完成了水利建设计划的50％。
    本报讯　云南玉溪县已建成了“长藤结瓜”式水利灌溉网，作到一次降雨二百毫米不成灾，一年无雨不受旱。
    玉溪县在1954年到1956年就曾经建成了一个长达三十九公里的“长藤结瓜”式自流灌溉网，使全县水田的灌溉面积由五千多亩扩大到四万五千多亩。
    随着生产发展，这种初级的水利灌溉网已不能满足需要了。玉溪县委以不断革命精神，根据本县四周高山中间低洼的自然特点，决定在全县四周山谷上游修建中小型水库群，把“长藤结瓜”搬上山去，以便从根本上治服洪水，保证全部耕地自流灌溉。经过两年的艰苦努力，规划实现了。1959年春耕开始时，境内各山谷上已建起了蓄水能力在百万立方米到二千五百万立方米的中小型水库二十三座，控制水量的能力已达一亿多立方米。尽管雨水稀少，全县第一次抢在最适宜栽秧的节令栽上了秧。
    1959年冬季，中共玉溪县委提出了建成根本消除旱洪灾害的高级水利网的任务。从11月份开始，县委组织了近三万个劳动力，继续兴修1958年动工、蓄水量达一亿二千万立方米的东风水库和兴修长达二百三十五公里的二十二条中小型干渠。目前，一条长达四十五公里每秒流量五立方米的东风大沟已经初步修通；可供灌溉蓄水、航运、养鱼、发电等综合利用的东风水库，也已完成了工程量的70％以上。至此，全县的一个大型自流灌溉网，四个小型自流灌溉网都已形成。这些水系的控制水量可达三亿立方米左右，最大的玉溪灌溉网已经把包括六个公社的大半个县围绕起来，形成了一个循环式的大水库群。这个水库群通过干渠共连接了九百零九个大、中、小型水库，总控制水量达一亿七千四百二十多万平方米。在这个大水利网之外，还有四个人民公社单独建成了小型自流灌溉网，每个水利网都通过干渠，分别连结七十到五百五十个中、小型水库，控制水量分别在七百一十万立方米到二千三百八十万立方米之间。这五个大、小水系的干渠和支渠长达一千多公里，全部工程蓄水以后，不仅可以在水库与水库之间调剂水量，而且可以在年度之间调剂水量，使全县二十五万亩水田，每亩有水一千立方米左右，使十一万亩水浇地平均每亩有水四百立方米以上，无论山区坝区，可以保证一年无雨全县蓄水用不完，一次降雨二百毫米不致造成洪水泛滥。
    由于水库开闸以后，水流量大，整个灌溉区必须统一时间放水，而各公社、管理区、生产队作物的收种时间不同，劳力畜力的安排和深翻施肥、晒垡等工作进度不能一致，灌溉系统的统一放水就给春耕生产造成被动局面。因此，县委决定把以前建立的数百个水塘改成临时配水站，提前半个多月把公社、管理区所需要的水，从水库输入配水站，使每个公社管理区可以根据自己的安排，适时灌溉。这种配水站的优点是：不占耕地面积，一般在收割越冬作物以后，开始蓄水，放洪水以后又可以栽种稻谷。配水站的面积大，蓄水浅，可以起到晒水提高水温的作用；同时配水站可以调剂库存，大水库把水输往配水站以后，可以继续蓄水，提高了蓄水、防洪能力；这种配水站还可以加强用水单位的责任心，便于统一管理，也有利于节约用水。
