Strengthen Procurement, Self-Production and Self-Use, Mutual Exchange, and Comprehensive Utilization
Hefei Vigorously Grabs Light Industrial Raw Materials
Over One Hundred Factories Have Made Arrangements for the First Quarter's Production of Raw Materials

(Our dispatch) The light industrial departments of Hefei City, Anhui Province, are relying on their own efforts and are doing everything possible to open up sources of raw materials. At present, raw materials for the first quarter's production of 121 factories have been resolved.

Hefei City's light industrial production this year is required to have a greater increase than last year. The quantity and variety of raw materials needed have increased greatly compared with previous years. In addition to a portion being allocated and supplied by the state, the vast majority must be resolved by the light industrial departments through their own efforts.

The main methods adopted by the light industrial factories in Hefei City in solving the problem of raw materials are: (1) Strengthening procurement work. In addition to purchasing in various parts of the province, they also go to other places to purchase raw materials through various connections. At present, the city's light industrial factories have purchased 99 kinds of raw materials from other places. The Yongjian Manufacturing Factory purchased 150 tons of waste cotton from twelve counties in the Wuhu, Bengbu, and Lu'an special districts, which can guarantee the first quarter's production needs of the factory's textile workshop. (2) Relying on one's own efforts to run auxiliary workshops to produce raw materials. At present, nearly ten factories, including Jingguang Glass Factory, Haohua Food Factory, Electrical Appliance Factory, Soap Factory, Anhui Textile Factory No. 1, and Knitting Factory, have built auxiliary workshops for producing raw materials in a simple and crude manner, producing more than ten kinds of chemical raw materials such as baking soda, carbon rods, glycerin, and bleaching powder, which can basically meet the production needs of the factories themselves. (3) Inter-factory cooperation, mutual exchange. Now, the cooperation between factories has developed from temporary cooperation to the establishment of fixed cooperative relations, which further guarantees the supply of raw materials. For example, after Yongjian Manufacturing Factory established a fixed cooperative relationship with Knitting Factory and Anhui Textile Factory No. 1, it used the waste brushed hair discarded by these two factories to completely solve the raw materials needed by the factory's textile workshop. (4) Establishing raw material production bases to expand the source of raw materials. Hefei area plans to expand the planting of several thousand mu of high-yield tobacco leaves and a portion of rush, sugar beets, roses, etc. this year. (5) Vigorously carry out comprehensive utilization of agricultural products and wild plants, so that one thing can be used for many purposes and everything can be used to its full potential. (6) Vigorously recover waste products and utilize all usable waste and old items. The Electrical Appliance Factory mobilized all employees to carry out a ten-day blitz, recovering 42,126 waste light bulbs from various agencies, factories, schools, enterprises, and other units, solving the problem of the shortage of bulb shells and copper wires.

After taking the above measures, the raw materials needed for the first quarter by 121 factories in the city's light industrial system have been basically resolved, providing a reliable material foundation for completing and over fulfilling the first quarter's production tasks ahead of schedule.

    加强采购　自产自用　互通有无　综合利用
    合肥大抓轻工业原料
    一百多个工厂首季生产原料材料作好安排
    本报讯　安徽省合肥市轻工业部门自力更生，千方百计开辟原材料来源。目前，已有一百二十一个工厂首季生产原料已经解决。
    合肥市今年轻工业生产，要求比去年有更大的增长，需要的原料材料无论数量和品种都比往年大大增加，其中除一部分由国家调拨供应外，绝大部分都要由轻工业部门自力更生来解决。
    合肥市各轻工业工厂在解决原料材料问题时采取的主要办法是：（一）加强采购工作。除在本省各地采购外，还到外地通过各种关系采购原料材料。目前全市各轻工业工厂已从外地采购回来的原料有九十九种。永坚制造厂从芜湖、蚌埠、六安三个专区的十二个县购回废棉一百五十吨，可以保证该厂纺织车间第一季度生产的需要。（二）自力更生，自办附属车间，生产原料材料。目前已有晶光玻璃厂、好华食品厂、电器厂、肥皂厂、安纺一厂和针织厂等近十个工厂，因陋就简地建立起生产原材料的附属车间，生产了小苏打、炭精棒、甘油、漂白粉等十多种化工原料，基本上能满足各厂本身生产的需要。（三）厂际协作，互通有无。现在，厂与厂之间已由临时协作发展到建立固定的协作关系，从而进一步保证了原料的供应。如永坚制造厂和针织厂、安纺一厂建立了固定的协作关系以后，利用这两个厂废弃的拉绒毛，彻底解决了该厂纺织车间所需的原料。（四）建立原材料生产基地，扩大原材料来源。合肥地区今年计划扩种数千亩高产烟叶和一部分灯草、甜菜、玫瑰花等。（五）大搞农产品和野生植物的综合利用，使一物多用，物尽其用。（六）大力回收废品，把能够利用的废旧物品统统利用起来。电器厂发动全厂职工，突击十天，到各机关、工厂、学校、企业等单位收回废灯泡四万二千一百二十六个，解决了泡壳和铜丝缺乏的问题。
    采取了以上各种措施以后，全市轻工业系统已有一百二十一个工厂第一季度需要的原材料基本得到解决，为提前完成和超额完成首季生产任务，提供了可靠的物质基础。
