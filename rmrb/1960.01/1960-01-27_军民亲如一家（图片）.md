The army and the people are as close as one family.
Last year, the four counties of Huiyang, Boluo, Dongguan, and Zengcheng in the Dongjiang River basin of Guangdong suffered severe floods. The Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the area immediately mobilized and selflessly helped the masses in flood prevention and disaster relief, earning praise from the people.
