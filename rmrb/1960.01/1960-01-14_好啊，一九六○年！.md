Spring is so beautiful that it excites us. We seem to be riding a steed that travels a thousand miles a day, galloping through the journey of 1959. On the first day of 1960, we saw so many good news reports of a flying start:

　　Anshan Iron and Steel, starting at zero hour on New Year's Day, tens of thousands of troops were put into the first joint technical performance week of this year's steel production to continue the Great Leap Forward. Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, Beipiao and other coal mines, on New Year's Day, the output of raw coal increased by 12.9% compared with the daily plan, and tunneling increased by 17.8% compared with the daily plan. In the Karamay oil area, on New Year's Day, the production class indicators such as drilling and oil extraction were generally overfulfilled. Tens of thousands of workers in the Greater Khingan Range forest area achieved a flying start in the icy and snowy weather, producing more than 16,400 cubic meters of logs in twelve hours....

　　Well, dear 1960, you have brought us endless good news in this short day. Just looking at the few lines written here is enough to be exciting and encouraging!

　　This first day of "good news at the start" is not accidental. This is because the 600 million Chinese people with great ambitions have long been drumming up their efforts to strive for a continued leap forward in 1960, and it is just a small test of their skills on New Year's Day. After two years of the Great Leap Forward, the situation and conditions in 1960 are better and the foundation is more solid than last year. Therefore, we have every reason to believe that following this good start, there will inevitably be a full month of red, month after month of red, and a full year of red on all economic fronts across the country. Not only will it be a full year of red in 1960, but in the future it will be red throughout the entire 1960s.

    好啊，一九六○年！
    罗木法
    大好春光，使我们心情激荡，我们好像骑在一匹日行千里的骏马上，驰过了1959年的行程。跨入1960年的第一天，我们就看到了这么多开门红的捷报：
    鞍钢，在元旦零点开始，十几万大军投入了今年钢铁生产继续跃进的第一个联合技术表演周。抚顺、阜新、本溪、北票等煤矿，在元旦这一天，原煤产量比日计划提高12．9％，掘进比日计划提高17．8％。克拉玛依油区，在元旦这一天，钻井、采油等生产班指标，普遍超额完成。大兴安岭林区的数万职工，在冰天雪地中实现开门红，十二个小时内，生产了一万六千四百多立方米原木……。
    好啦，亲爱的1960年，你在这短短的一天中给我们带来了书写不尽的喜讯，只要看看这里所写的寥寥几条，也就够令人兴奋，令人鼓舞的了！
    这第一天“开门见喜”来的并不偶然，这是有着雄心大志的六亿中国人民，早就鼓好了争取1960年继续跃进的劲头，在元旦这天，小试锋芒而已。经过了两年的大跃进，1960年的形势和条件，比去年更好，基础也更坚实。因此我们完全有理由相信：继这个良好的开端之后，必然会在全国各个经济战线上出现全月红、月月红、全年红，不仅是1960年的全年红，而且将来会是红满整个六十年代。
