Xinhua News Agency report: Qingfeng County, Henan Province, has established 370 oil pressing, brewing, and starch factories. They use the stems, seedlings, skins, shells, and leaves of plants such as peanuts, beans, and sesame to extract oil, brew wine, and extract starch. The oil cake, distiller's grains, and starch residue are used as pig feed. Currently, in addition to producing large quantities of oil, wine, and starch, these factories also produce 1.27 million jin of various high-quality feeds daily, enough to feed 400,000 pigs.

According to tests conducted by the Provincial Grain Bureau and the County Agricultural Science Research Institute, these oil cakes, distiller's grains, and starch residues all contain nutrients, so it is not necessary to mix them with grain when feeding pigs.

Xinhua News Agency report: While promoting the experience of Dancheng County, Henan Province, in using sesame stalks to extract oil, Liaoning Province has also successfully extracted oil from soybean stalks, peanut stalks, and peanut skins. According to recent experiments by the oil extraction workshop of the Beizhen County Flour Mill, every 100 jin can extract one to three jin of edible oil and about ten jin of lubricating oil for vehicles. The residue after oil extraction can also be used as feed.

Recently, the Liaoning Provincial Grain Bureau has promoted this experience throughout the province.

Xinhua News Agency report: Staff of the Zhuozi County Grain Department in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region successfully experimented with using flax chaff to extract oil. After 13 consecutive trial extractions, the oil yield per 100 jin of flax chaff was consistently between four and eight jin, with a maximum of eight jin and seven liang. This experience has begun to be promoted throughout the autonomous region.

Flax chaff is the general term for flaxseed husks, crushed flax stalks, and flax leaves. The oil currently extracted in Zhuozi County is all crude oil, which can be further refined into axle or machine belt oil. The flax chaff cake after oil extraction can also be used as feed.

    清丰、北镇用花生壳大豆秆榨油作饲料
    卓资从葫麻籽壳、秆、叶中榨出润滑油
    据新华社讯　河南省清丰县兴办了三百七十个榨油、酿酒和淀粉厂，利用花生、豆类、芝麻等植物的茎、秧、皮、壳和叶子等榨油、酿酒和提制淀粉，用油饼、酒糟、淀粉残渣作猪饲料。目前，这些工厂除生产了大量的油、酒、淀粉以外，还日产各种优质饲料一百二十七万斤，可供四十万头猪食用。
    据省粮食厅和县农业科学研究所等部门化验，这些油饼、酒糟和淀粉残渣内都含有营养质，用它来喂猪不需要再掺粮食。
    据新华社讯　辽宁省在推广河南省郸城县用芝麻秸榨油经验的同时，又用大豆秸、花生秸、花生皮榨油成功。据北镇县面粉厂制油车间最近试验，每百斤可以榨出食用油一斤到三斤，浇车用的润滑油十斤左右。榨过油的渣子还可以作饲料。
    最近，辽宁省粮食厅已将这项经验向全省推广。
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区卓资县粮食部门职工试用葫麻只子榨油成功，经过连续试榨十三次，每百斤葫麻只子出油率每次都在四到八斤中间，最高达到八斤七两。这个经验已开始在自治区各地推广。
    葫麻只子是葫麻籽粒外壳、碾碎的葫麻秆和葫麻叶的总称。卓资县现在榨出的油都是毛油，这种毛油经过进一步熬炼可作车轴或机带油。榨过油的葫麻只饼，还可以作饲料。
