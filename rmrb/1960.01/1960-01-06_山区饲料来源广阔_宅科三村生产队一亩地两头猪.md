    Extensive Fodder Sources in Mountainous Areas
    Zhaike Third Village Production Team Raises Two Pigs Per Mu
    This is a remote mountain village. Before Liberation, more than 30 out of 49 households in the village were beggars. In 1959, they raised 853 pigs, an increase of twenty times compared to before the cooperative; grain production also increased correspondingly by more than two times, transforming a grain-deficient village into a surplus-grain village.
    The Zhaike Third Village Production Team, based on the characteristics of the mountainous area, collected a large amount of leaves, wild grass, and wild vegetables to feed pigs, solving the fodder problem. Raising more pigs promoted the comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. This poor mountain village is now: lush with trees, prosperous with livestock, and abundant with grains.
    The Zhaike Third Village Production Team of Mazhuang People's Commune in Rizhao County, Shandong Province, is a remote mountain village. In 1959, because this village had twenty times more pigs than before the cooperative, grain production increased correspondingly by more than two times, transforming a grain-deficient village into a surplus-grain village. Before Liberation, this place was barren hills and mountains with infertile land and very low grain yields. More than 30 out of 49 households in this village were beggars. After Liberation, under the leadership of the Party, they controlled mountains and rivers, afforested barren mountains, and vigorously promoted pig raising and manure accumulation. Especially after communization, agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production experienced even greater leaps forward. Now, it is lush with trees, pig and cattle pens are full, there are abundant grains, and the six domestic animals are thriving.
    
    Raising Pigs Promotes a Comprehensive Leap Forward in Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry
    
    The rapid change in the face of poverty and barrenness in Zhaike Third Village in a few short years is the result of the combination, mutual dependence, mutual promotion, and comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry.
    
    In the past few years, afforestation has controlled soil erosion, but how to increase grain production on poor land? The Party branch led everyone to find the cause of low yields: insufficient fertilizer. How to solve the fertilizer problem? The only good way is to raise more pigs. The barren mountains have been afforested, and there are various leaves, wild grasses, and wild vegetables for feed, which is the condition for raising a large number of pigs. In 1954, the entire team raised 46 pigs; in 1957, it developed to 125 pigs; in 1958, it developed to 425 pigs; and in 1959, it developed to 853 pigs, of which public ownership accounted for 75.3%, an average of more than two pigs per person and two pigs per mu of grain land.
    
    With the increase in pig raising, the amount of fertilizer applied has increased year by year, and grain production has also increased year by year. In 1953, 1,500 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu here, and the single yield of grain per mu was 240 jin; in 1954, 2,400 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu, and the single yield was 260 jin; in 1957, 7,000 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu, and the single yield was 420 jin and 9 liang; in 1958, 8,000 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu, and the single yield was 556 jin and 7 liang; in 1959, 13,000 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu, and the single yield was 760 jin. Now, the team members' rations have gone from insufficient to surplus, and from a grain-deficient village to a surplus-grain village. In 1959, they sold 20,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The problem of grain shortage has been solved, and some cultivated land has been freed up to expand orchards and cultivate 180 mu of seedlings. In addition to supplying seedlings for planting in the commune, they also supported brother communes with seedlings. The orchards and nurseries that originally had no fertilizer to apply have also been fertilized with a large amount of fertilizer, so the seedlings grow vigorously and are released early. The seedlings grafted in 1955 were released in 1956, with more than 3,000 trees. The fruit trees grow well and bear fruit early. The apples planted in 1955 bore fruit in three years. This year, the team harvested a total of 12,000 jin of various fruits.
    
    Due to increased agricultural production, the number of large livestock has risen sharply. Before Liberation, the entire village had a total of thirteen head of draft cattle, and each head had to bear more than 50 mu of land. In 1954, it developed to 21 heads, in 1957 it was 28 heads, in 1958 it was 30 heads, and in 1959 it developed to 38 heads, an average of one draft animal per eleven mu of cultivated land. With more draft animals, this further promoted the development of agricultural production.
    
    Rely on the Mountains, Specialize in Feeding
    
    With more pigs, feed is a major issue. Based on the experience of using tree leaves to feed pigs in other places and the local characteristics of many mountains and trees, the Party branch collected a large number of tree leaves to feed pigs. In the beginning, they used fruit tree leaves to feed pigs, and the pigs ate very deliciously. When the fruit tree leaves were not enough, the feeders used miscellaneous tree leaves to make fermented feed, and the pigs also ate happily. The entire team has twenty-one kinds of tree leaves and thirty kinds of wild grasses and vegetables that can be used to feed pigs. In this way, the feed problem was solved. Now, the team has collected more than 170,000 jin of various rough feeds.
    
    With more pigs, more labor is also required. Agriculture requires intensive cultivation, and forestry requires processing and management, but the entire team only has 134 laborers, and the labor force feels very strained. They adopted the method of dividing battle lines and unified command, dividing the team's labor force into three professional teams: 20 people for forestry, 34 people for animal husbandry (including 25 people for pig raising, an average of one person managing 34 pigs), and the remaining 80 people engaged in agriculture. The system of contracting work, contracting production, contracting costs, and rewarding exceeding quotas is implemented in agriculture and forestry. Each professional team is responsible for its own work. For agricultural work that is time-sensitive, labor is mobilized in a unified manner to complete it in a concentrated manner, and work points are mutually compensated between teams. In order to solve the problem of insufficient labor for transporting manure, they moved the pens to the mountains, accumulated fertilizer on the spot, and applied fertilizer on the spot, saving more than 600 workdays throughout the year.
    
    In 1960, this production team plans to raise 1,600 pigs. They plan to build three more pig pens and eight cattle sheds on the mountain, requiring 15,000 jin of fertilizer to be applied per mu of spring land, and the yield of grain per mu to reach 1,200 jin; topdressing and pruning fruit trees. Cattle will be developed from the current 38 to 45 heads, chickens will be developed to 4,000, rabbits will be developed to 1,200, bees will be developed to 26 boxes, continue to raise silkworms, and develop 300 sheep and 50 ducks.
    
    After this plan was presented to the team members, everyone said that it could be completed.

    山区饲料来源广阔
    宅科三村生产队一亩地两头猪
    这里是个偏僻的小山村。解放前，全村四十九户有三十多户要饭的。1959年养猪八百五十三头，比合作化前增加了二十倍；粮食产量也相应增长了两倍多，缺粮村变成了余粮村。
    宅科三村生产队根据山区特点，大量采摘树叶、野草、野菜喂猪，解决了饲料问题。多养猪，促进了农林牧全面跃进。这个穷山庄如今是：绿树成荫，六畜兴旺，五谷丰登。
    山东日照县马庄人民公社宅科三村生产队，是个偏僻的小山村。1959年，由于这个村猪比合作化前增加二十倍，粮食相应地增产了两倍多，缺粮村变成了余粮村。解放前，这里荒山秃岭，土地瘠薄，粮食产量很低，这村四十九户就有三十多户要饭的。解放后，在党的领导下治山治水，绿化荒山，大抓养猪积肥，特别在公社化后，农、林、牧生产更有飞跃的发展，如今绿树成荫、猪牛满圈、五谷丰登、六畜兴旺。
    养猪促进农林牧全面跃进
    宅科三村在短短几年内迅速改变了地瘠民贫的面貌，是农、林、牧三者结合，互相依赖，互相促进，综合发展的结果。
    几年来，绿化控制了水土流失，但是薄地怎样多打粮呢？党支部领着大家找低产原因，是肥料不足。怎样解决肥料？唯一的好办法是多养猪。荒山绿化了，有各种树叶、野草、野菜作饲料，这就是大量养猪的条件。1954年全队养猪四十六头，1957年发展到一百二十五头，1958年发展到四百二十五头，1959年发展到八百五十三头，其中公养占75．3％，平均每人两头多，每亩粮田两头猪。
    随着养猪多，施肥量逐年增加，粮食产量也年年提高。1953年，这里每亩施肥一千五百斤，粮食每亩单产二百四十斤；1954年每亩施肥两千四百斤，单产二百六十斤；1957年每亩施肥七千斤，单产四百二十斤九两；1958年每亩施肥八千斤，单产五百五十六斤七两；1959年每亩施肥一万三千斤，单产七百六十斤。现在全队社员口粮由不足到有余，由缺粮村变为余粮村，1959年就卖给国家两万斤余粮。缺粮问题解决了，就腾出一部耕地扩大果园，育苗一百八十亩，除供本社栽植外，还支援了兄弟社树苗。原来无肥可施的果园苗圃，也都施了大量肥料，树苗因此长的旺、出圃早。1955年嫁接的苗木，1956年就出圃三千多棵；果树生长好，早结果，1955年栽的苹果，三年就结果了。今年全队共收获各种果品一万二千斤。
    由于农业增产，大家畜直线上升。解放前，全村总共十三头耕牛，一头要负担五十多亩地。1954年发展到二十一头，1957年是二十八头，1958年三十头，1959年发展到三十八头，平均十一亩耕地一头耕畜。耕畜多了，这就又促进了农业生产的发展。
    靠山吃山　专业饲养
    养猪多了，饲料是桩大事。党支部根据外地用树叶喂猪的经验和当地山多树多特点，大量采摘树叶喂猪。开始，他们用果树叶子喂猪，猪吃的挺香。果树叶子不够了，饲养员又用杂树叶子作变糟发酵饲料，猪也吃的挺欢。全队有二十一种树叶子、三十多种野草、野菜可以喂猪。这一来，饲料问题就解决了。现在全队已采集各种粗饲料十七万多斤。
    养猪多了，占的劳力也多，农业要精耕细作，林业要加工管理，但是全队只一百三十四个劳力，劳力感到很紧张。他们采取了划分战线、统一指挥的方法，将全队劳力分了三个专业队：林业二十人，畜牧三十四人（其中养猪的二十五人，平均一人管理三十四头猪），其余八十人搞农业。在农业和林业中实行包工、包产、包成本和超额奖励制度。专业队各负其责，对时间性强的农活，就统一抽调劳力突击完成，各队间互相找补工分。为解决运粪劳力不足，他们把栏圈迁上山，就地积肥，就地施肥，全年节省了六百多工日。
    1960年，这个生产队计划养猪一千六百头，他们要在山上再修三处猪圈和八间牛栏，要求每亩春地施肥一万五千斤，亩产粮食达到一千二百斤；对果树追肥、整枝。牛由现在的三十八头发展到四十五头，鸡发展到四千只，兔发展到一千二百只，蜂发展到二十六箱，继续养蚕，并发展三百只羊，五十只鸭。
    这计划跟社员见面后，大家都说能够完成。
