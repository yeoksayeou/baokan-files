Guaranteeing a Flying Start
Secretary of the Beijing Electron Tube Factory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Bai Tao

Every New Year, people have personal expectations: In the new year, in what area will I achieve greater progress? This year, for people, especially for workers and farmers fighting on the production front, their first hope, which they strive for in every possible way, is whether they can achieve a "flying start"!

Our comrades at the Beijing Electron Tube Factory are heading to the factory with this feeling, full of joy and high spirits. Whether on the bus to the factory or on the sidewalk leading to the workshop, you can hear lively discussions, everyone talking about "flying start." From their discussions, you can hear a bold statement expressing the workers' great ambitions: "We will definitely achieve a flying start!"

"We will definitely achieve a flying start!" I firmly believe this, and we will definitely achieve a flying start. Indeed, for our heroes, what else is impossible! Since officially starting production, for three years, production has been higher every quarter and every year, achieving brilliant achievements of "monthly red, quarterly rise, and annual leap," and has been repeatedly rated as a Red Flag Factory in Beijing. Last November, it also gloriously attended the National Conference of Heroes as an advanced collective.

More importantly: our worker comrades are people who are never complacent and never relax. The high honor given to them by the Party has become a huge driving force for their continuous leap forward. This time, in order to win the flying start of 1960, they carried out such arduous "pre-war preparations" as in the past! Although it was during the holiday, the factory's repair workers fought day and night in the factory buildings and workshops, completing the maintenance of all machinery and equipment within two days.

Especially today—on the first day of 1960, when people are still immersed in the joy of the New Year, many of them went to the factory two, three, or even four hours early. Each production team held a pre-shift preparation meeting and immediately started to check the machinery and equipment and prepare tools. The workshop director and the Party branch secretary arrived even earlier than everyone else. They walked through one workroom after another, wishing everyone a happy New Year; wishing everyone a flying start in production! The sun is shining brightly, and a magnificent and moving beautiful scene is unfolding before us!

As you sow, so shall you reap. The workers of the Beijing Electron Tube Factory finally fired the first shot of this year's high-speed leap forward. On the first day of 1960, the factory's attendance rate reached 100%, and the output, variety, quality, and cost all comprehensively overfulfilled the daily plan. The whole factory achieved a flying start. The daily output of the tool and parts branch nearly doubled compared with December of last year's Great Leap Forward, achieving a high-speed leap forward right from the start of the year. The six-ton furnace and four-ton furnace of the glass branch increased production by 40%, and the daily output of the receiving and amplifying branch increased by 30%, all setting the highest records since the start of production.

Look, they are coming! These heroic workers, holding high the production good news, beating gongs and drums, used high-speed leap forward achievements to open the door to 1960. The exciting production good news came frequently, and the teams reporting good news came one after another, the sound of gongs and drums louder and louder. At this moment, I can't help but feel the excitement in my heart. Who knows, there are thousands of such victors across the country, who have fired the first shot of this year with their excellent work!

However, I have felt this kind of joy of victory countless times. I firmly believe that I will continue to feel this joy in the future. Because I deeply know that for these people who never relax and never become complacent, this is just the beginning of victory. They will definitely, like all advanced factories and mines in the country, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, achieve monthly red, quarterly rise in indicators, and a full house red throughout the year in the future production struggle. At that time, I will feel even greater joy.

Because, I am convinced of this truth: With a never-slackening fighting spirit, there will be a leap forward wave after wave, and greater victories can be achieved!

    开门红的保证
    中共北京电子管厂委员会书记　白涛
    每逢新年，人们都有个人的瞻望：在新的一年中，我要在哪一方面取得更大的进步。而今年，对于人们来说，特别是对于战斗在生产战线上的工人、农民来说，他们千方百计、孜孜以求的第一个希望，就是能否夺得“开门红”！
    我们北京电子管厂的工人同志们就怀着这种心情，喜气洋洋、精神抖擞地奔向工厂。无论是在开往工厂的汽车上，或者是在通向车间的人行道上，你都能够听到活跃的议论，人人都说“开门红”。从他们的议论中，你可以听到一句表达工人们的雄心大志的豪言壮语：“我们一定能够实现开门红！”
    “我们一定能够实现开门红！”这句话，我是坚信不疑的，我们一定能够取得开门红。的确，对于我们的英雄们来说，还有什么做不到的事呢！自从正式投入生产以来，三年如一日，生产一季高过一季，一年高过一年，取得了“月月红、季季升、年年跃”的辉煌成就，曾连续多次被评为北京市的红旗厂，去年11月又作为先进集体光荣地出席了全国群英会。
    更重要的是：我们的工人同志们都是一些从不自满，永不松懈的人。党给予他们的崇高荣誉，成了推动他们不断跃进的巨大动力。这次为了夺得1960年开门红，他们跟历次一样，进行了多么艰苦的“战前准备”啊！虽然是在假日期间，但全厂的机修工人却日夜奋战在厂房和车间里，两天之内完成了全部机器设备的维修任务。
    特别是今天——在1960年的第一天，当人们还沉浸在新年的欢乐中的时候，他们却有不少人提前两小时、三小时，甚至四小时就奔向了工厂。每个生产小组开过班前准备会，立即动手进行检查机器设备和准备工具。而车间主任、党支部书记更比大家来得早。他们走过一个工作间，又一个工作间，祝贺大家过年好；预祝人人生产开门红！阳光灿烂，在我们的面前，真是展现了一幅多么壮丽、多么动人的美景啊！
    ×　×　×
    种豆的得豆，种瓜的得瓜。北京电子管厂的工人们终于打响了今年高速度跃进的第一炮。在1960年的第一天，全厂出勤率达到100％，产量、品种、质量、成本也都全面超额地完成了日计划，全厂实现了开门红。工具零件分厂日产量比去年大跃进的12月翻了将近一番，今年一上来就高速度跃进。玻璃分厂的六吨炉、四吨炉增产40％，收讯放大分厂日产量提高30％，都创造了开工以来的最高纪录。
    你瞧，他们走来了！这些英雄的工人们，高举着生产捷报，敲打着锣鼓，用高速度的跃进成就打开了1960年的大门。振奋人心的生产捷报频频传来，报喜的队伍一个接着一个，锣鼓声一阵高过一阵。此时此刻，我怎么也抑制不住内心的激动。谁能知道，全国各地正有千万个这样的胜利者，用自己的出色的劳动打响了今年的头一炮！
    然而，我所感受到的这种胜利的喜悦，也不知有过多少次了。我深信，今后我将会不断地感受到这种喜悦。因为我深深地知道，对于这些永不松懈，永不自满的人们来说，这仅仅是个胜利的开端，他们定能跟全国所有的先进厂矿一样，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在今后的生产斗争中，实现月月红，指标季季升，全年满堂红。那时，我就会感受到更大的喜悦。
    因为，我确信这样一条真理：有永不松懈的斗志，就有一浪高过一浪的跃进，就能取得更大的胜利！
