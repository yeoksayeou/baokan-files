    A Noteworthy International Political Conspiracy
    By Our Commentator
    A large-scale anti-Semitic movement is spreading rapidly like a plague throughout the capitalist world. Since the appearance of fascist swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans on the walls of a synagogue in Cologne, West Germany, shortly before Christmas last year, similar anti-Jewish activities have occurred in many countries of the Western world in the past half-month, from Bonn to London, from New York to Santiago, and from Australia to the Union of South Africa. Nazi thugs not only openly posted slogans and carried out intimidation, but also burned and destroyed Jewish schools, homes, synagogues, monuments, and cemeteries in various places. These fascist acts have aroused serious condemnation from people of all countries in the world.
    Many reports from Western countries indicate that this large-scale anti-Semitic movement not only started in West Germany, but is also centered there. Nahum Goldmann, chairman of the World Jewish Congress, said that this anti-Semitic "action is organized" and that it was "launched by a new Nazi headquarters in West Germany." In some major cities in West Germany, Nazi elements even openly held demonstrations waving Hitler's swastika flag and chanting the slogan "Heil Hitler," and distributed leaflets calling on people to vote for former members of the German National Socialist Party. Joachim Prinz, president of the American Jewish Congress, believes that the current anti-Semitic incidents are "a signal from the neo-Nazi group," which shows that "although Hitler is dead, the spirit of Hitlerism is still alive, not only in Germany, but all over the world."
    The outbreak and expansion of fascist Anti-Semitic incidents in West Germany is by no means accidental. Under the protection of the Western imperialistic bloc headed by the United States, the West German authorities have not only failed to eliminate militarist and Nazi forces throughout the post-war period, but have also tried their best to support them. They rearm, restore the arms industry, reinstate Nazi war criminals, and continue to instill the spirit of revanchism and fascism into the younger generation in West Germany. Today, West Germany's army, judicial organs, diplomatic departments, and other state institutions are filled with former Hitler party members and all kinds of Nazi elements. People like former Nazi generals Speidel, Heusinger, and the executioner Oberländer, who once massacred a large number of Jews, have now become important figures in the West German military and political circles. At the same time, all kinds of fascist organizations have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, and have gradually united into national groups. They openly regard Hitler as a "god" and clamor madly to "liberate the Eastern Region," "guarantee the German space," and "eliminate worthless lives."
    The current anti-Semitic incidents are obviously a dangerous signal of the revival of fascism. People still remember that fascists are always accustomed to using anti-Semitic movements to incite racism and national chauvinistic sentiments as a means for them to persecute democratic forces, prepare for war, and carry out aggression. During World War II, fascist Germany killed six million Jews (one-third of the total number of Jews in the world), leaving the most cruel and shameful page in human history.
    In the face of unanimous condemnation by world public opinion, the West German authorities have tried their best to shirk their responsibility and deny that an "anti-Semitic wave" has already formed. The reactionary forces in many countries shamelessly fabricate lies, saying that anti-Semitism may be a "Communist tactic." But this slander precisely proves that one of the purposes of anti-Semitism is to launch a new anti-Communist wave and attack democratic progressive forces. According to a report by United Press International, the West Berlin authorities have begun to arrest Communists. This is a noteworthy situation.
    The anti-Semitic provocative activities currently spreading in the capitalist world are obviously a conspiracy of international reactionary forces. A report by Agence France-Presse once obscurely revealed that this is a "more or less spontaneous reactionary action" by "reactionary elements" in various countries, who believe that the current easing of the situation is detrimental to them. Therefore, they want to use fascist acts that provoke racial hatred to alienate the people of various countries, incite a "cold war," and hinder the trend towards easing the international situation. In this situation, all peace-loving people need to maintain a high degree of vigilance.

    一个值得注意的国际政治阴谋
    本报评论员
    一个大规模的反犹太人运动正像瘟疫一样地在资本主义世界迅速地蔓延开来。自从去年圣诞节前夕在西德科隆的一个犹太人会堂的墙上出现了法西斯卐字和反犹太标语以后，近半个月来，从波恩到伦敦，从纽约到圣地亚哥，从澳大利亚到南非联邦，西方世界的许多国家内部接连出现了同样的反犹活动。纳粹暴徒们不但公然张贴标语，进行恐吓，而且还焚烧和破坏各地犹太人的学校、住宅、教堂、纪念碑和坟墓。这种法西斯行径已引起了世界各国人民的严重谴责。
    来自西方国家的许多消息表明，这个大规模的反犹运动不但从西德开始，而且也是以西德为中心的。世界犹太人大会政治部主任伊斯特曼说，这种反犹“行动是有组织的”，它是“由西德的一个新纳粹总部发动的”。在西德的一些主要城市，纳粹分子甚至还公然打着希特勒的卐字旗帜，高呼着“希特勒万岁”的口号举行示威游行，并且散发号召人们投票选举前德国国社党人的传单。美国犹太人大会主席普林兹认为：目前的反犹事件是“新纳粹集团的一个信号”，它表明，“虽然希特勒死了，希特勒主义的精神却还活着，不仅在德国，而且在全世界。”
    法西斯反犹事件在西德的爆发和扩大，决不是偶然的。在以美国为首的西方帝国主义集团的庇护下，西德当局在整个战后时期不但没有肃清军国主义和纳粹主义的势力，而且还竭力加以扶植。他们进行重新武装，恢复军火工业，起用纳粹战犯，并且继续把复仇主义和法西斯主义的精神灌输给西德的青年一代。现在西德的军队、司法机关、外交部门以及其他国家机构中充斥着前希特勒党徒和形形色色的纳粹分子。其中如前纳粹将领斯派达尔、豪辛格和曾经大量屠杀犹太人的刽子手奥勃兰德尔之流，今天又重新成为西德军政界的要人。同时，各种各样的法西斯组织，也像雨后春笋似地建立起来，并且逐渐地联合成为全国性的团体。他们公然把希特勒奉为“神明”，疯狂地叫嚣要“解放东方地区”，“保障德意志人的空间”和“消灭没有价值的生命”。
    目前的反犹事件，显然是法西斯主义复活的一个危险的信号。人们都还记得，法西斯主义者总是惯于利用反犹运动，来煽动种族主义和民族沙文主义情绪，以作为他们迫害民主力量、准备战争和进行侵略的一种手段。在第二次世界大战期间，法西斯德国曾经杀害了六百万犹太人（占全世界犹太人总数的三分之一），从而给人类历史留下了最残酷、最可耻的一页。
    在全世界舆论一致谴责的情况下，西德当局竭力企图推卸自己的责任，否认目前已经形成了“反犹太的浪潮”。许多国家的反动势力并且无耻地捏造谎言，说什么反犹可能是“共产党的策略”。但这种诬蔑恰恰证明，反犹的目的之一是想掀起新的反共浪潮，打击民主进步力量。据合众国际社报道，西柏林当局已经开始逮捕共产党人。这是一个值得注意的情况。
    目前在资本主义世界蔓延的反犹挑衅活动，显然是国际反动势力的一种阴谋。法新社的一篇报道曾经隐讳地透露说，这是各国“反动分子多少自发的反动行动”，这些分子认为，目前局势的缓和对他们是不利的。因此他们就想以挑起种族仇恨的法西斯行为来离间各国人民，煽动“冷战”，阻挠国际局势的趋向缓和。对于这种情况，一切爱好和平的人们尤其需要保持高度的警惕。
