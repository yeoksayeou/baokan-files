Our newspaper reports that China's burgeoning instrument and meter industry, especially thermal instrument technology, is undergoing rapid development. The instruments and meters needed for modern industry, which previously relied entirely on imports, are now basically self-sufficient.

At present, China is capable of producing more than 600 types of instruments and meters. During the Great Leap Forward in the steel industry in the past two years, a large number of small blast furnace instruments were manufactured across the country, meeting the needs of the "small foreign groups" in the steel industry. Some instrument factories have successfully trial-produced complete sets of automatic control devices and instruments required by steel enterprises such as gas stations, soaking furnaces, and heating furnaces, enabling China's steel industry to equip itself with domestically produced instruments. Shanghai DAHUA Instrument Factory has also begun mass production of complete sets of automatic control instruments for large-scale thermal power plants, which are being transported to various newly built power stations for installation and use. The instrument factories manufacturing gas analysis instruments have successfully trial-produced more than 20 types of gas analysis instruments, filling a gap in China's instrument industry. These instruments play an important role in ensuring the economic efficiency of coal consumption in power stations and the safe production of chemical plants.

In recent years, thanks to adhering to the Party's General Line and the policy of "walking on two legs," China's instrument industry has spread to major and medium-sized cities such as Shanghai. While the state is building new-type instrument factories, it has also carried out rectification, merger, and expansion work on some of the original small factories. The Harbin LONGJIANG Instrument Factory originally had only four or five old equipment pieces. After more than a year of development, it has become a factory with three or four hundred people and produces more than ten products, playing a significant role in supporting the Northeast region's electricity "drought resistance." The Shanghai Thermal Instrument Factory could only produce some pressure gauges and mercury thermometers. After rectification, merger, and improvement, it can now produce many new and precise instruments.

    大力健全现代工业的“神经中枢”
    仪表工业日新月异
    本报讯　我国新兴的仪器仪表工业，尤其是热工仪表正在日新月异地蓬勃发展，现代工业需要的仪表，已由过去完全依靠进口，转为基本上自给了。
    现在，我国已经能够生产六百多种仪表。在去年和前年钢铁工业大跃进中，全国各地制出了大量的小高炉仪表，满足了“小洋群”钢铁工业发展的需要。有的仪表厂试制成功煤气站、均热炉、加热炉等钢铁企业所需要的成套自动调节装置和仪表，使我国的钢铁工业可以用自己生产的仪表来装备。上海大华仪表厂也开始成批生产大型火力发电站的成套自动控制仪表，运往各新建发电站安装使用。制造气体分析的仪表厂已经试制成功二十多种气体分析仪器，补上了我国仪表工业中的一个缺门。这些仪表对保证电站煤耗的经济性和化工厂的安全生产都有重要的作用。
    几年来，由于坚持了党的总路线和两条腿走路的方针，我国仪表工业已经遍及上海等大、中城市。国家在建设新型仪表工厂的同时，也对原有的一些小厂进行了整顿、合并和扩建工作。哈尔滨龙江仪表厂原来只有四、五台陈旧的设备，经过一年多的发展，已成为拥有三、四百人的工厂；并生产出十多种产品，在支援东北地区的电力“抗旱”中，发挥了显著作用。上海热工仪表厂原来只能生产一些压力表和水银温度计，经过整顿、合并、提高以后，已能生产许多新的、精密的仪表。
