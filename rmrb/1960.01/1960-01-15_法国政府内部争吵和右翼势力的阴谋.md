The De Gaulle regime has been rocked by a fierce quarrel. This quarrel occurred between Prime Minister Debré and his confidants and Finance Minister Pinay. It fully exposed the major differences within the French government after De Gaulle came to power.

The quarrel, described by the Parisian bourgeois newspapers as a "serious political crisis," on the surface, reflects the differences between different French monopoly groups over the following three plans:

First, Debré and others advocated establishing a government financial institution, such as a bank, to manage the "industrialization and development" of backward areas in France and the "transformation" of small businesses, which Pinay opposed;

Second, Debré and others advocated establishing a government-controlled oil company responsible for the extraction, distribution, and sale of Saharan oil, which Pinay also opposed;

Third, Debré and others advocated revising the current French company law to stipulate that the management of private companies employing more than fifty employees will have a quarter of their personnel elected by union representatives, and the state will also appoint representatives to participate, which Pinay also opposed.

However, the significance of this quarrel goes far beyond the above-mentioned scope. It essentially reflects the intensification and surfacing of contradictions within the French ruling class, between the French ruling class and international monopoly groups, especially the U.S. and British oil monopoly organizations, and between the French ruling class and the broad masses of the French people.

From the perspective of the French ruling group, this quarrel reflects the contradiction between the emerging French oil and atomic energy monopoly groups, which are the backbone of the De Gaulle regime, and the traditional, established monopoly groups in the struggle for power and profit. The emerging monopoly groups are trying to seize financial and economic power in the name of "state capitalism."

The emerging French oil monopoly group has extremely close relations with the De Gaulle regime and De Gaulle's party, the "Union for the New Republic." They are trying to use the regime they control and state financial resources to further accelerate the process of capital concentration, form a strong monopoly force, and thereby create favorable conditions for foreign expansion. French Minister of Armed Forces Guillaumat and Minister of Industry and Commerce Jeanneney are representatives of this group. Their envisioned policies of developing backward areas and transforming small businesses are a reflection of this intention. However, this policy has encountered opposition from Pinay, who represents the interests of traditional monopoly groups. These people are worried that the emerging monopoly groups will grow stronger with the help of state capital and become their political and economic rivals. Therefore, they want to prevent the realization of the emerging monopoly groups' plans with various excuses. For example, they oppose the establishment of an oil refining and distribution company, saying that the company will "interfere too much in politics," and that the establishment of the company will compete with existing enterprises.

From the perspective of the relationship between the French ruling class and international monopoly groups, this quarrel reflects the contradiction between the international monopoly capital that historically controlled the French oil refining and sales network, trying to continue to monopolize French oil enterprises, and the emerging French oil monopoly groups that are trying to squeeze out the above-mentioned forces.

Most of France's existing refining capacity is controlled by international oil monopoly organizations, such as Shell, British Petroleum, and Esso, which account for 64.7% of the total. Although the French Petroleum Company controls a quarter of the above-mentioned refining capacity, this company has shares in the Iraqi and Iranian oil companies in the Middle East. Therefore, it is very interested in refining Middle Eastern oil, while the French government's newly purchased refinery in France, originally owned by the American Texaco Company, has a refining capacity of only 3.5% of France's total refining capacity. Therefore, the French government is trying its best to establish a large-scale company directly controlled by it to expand French oil production. As for the sales network, international oil monopoly organizations almost control the entire market, and the company that the French government has already purchased only accounts for 4%.

Obviously, the emerging French oil monopoly capital intends to use state capital to establish an oil monopoly organization, concentrate all independent refining and sales systems in France, so as to be able to control 10% to 15% of the French refining and distribution system, in order to bargain with international monopoly groups and obtain a favorable position in oil sales within the "Common Market." This activity has caused unease among the international oil cartels. Pinay's opposition to Debré's plan reflects the contradiction between the old French monopoly groups, which are related to international oil groups, and the emerging oil groups that want to monopolize the French oil market and further penetrate the Western European market.

Between the French ruling class and the French people, due to the French government's implementation of policies that target the working people, taxes have increased, prices have risen, wages have been frozen, and civilian expenditures have been reduced over the past year. Not only workers and peasants, but also the middle class such as small businessmen, clerks, professors, and students, are increasingly dissatisfied with the French government's financial and economic policies. Faced with this growing pressure from the people, the French ruling group wants to quell the people's anger and find an excuse to make the people tighten their consumption and endure exploitation. Therefore, they plan to shift the responsibility for the serious consequences of past policies to Pinay in order to divert the people's anger. Recently, whenever the working people demanded wage increases, the relevant departments sent people to find Pinay. At the same time, when these departments responded to union representatives who demanded wage increases, they pushed the responsibility to the Ministry of Finance. This trend can be seen from this. At the same time, the French government also wants to slightly increase wages and implement so-called "labor-management cooperation" in which worker representatives participate in the management departments as a means to ease class struggle, in an attempt to exchange this for the French people to make new sacrifices for France's economic expansion, that is, for the profits of emerging monopoly groups.

In this political situation, a new noteworthy sign is emerging in France, that is, the ruling group in power in France is planning to use the current crisis as a stepping stone to further dictatorship. It is rumored in Paris that De Gaulle is prepared to use this opportunity to directly control financial power in his own hands and those of his confidants. "La Croix" predicts that "at a time when the crisis is threatening us, the power of the parliament may be suspended." "Les Échos" also revealed that De Gaulle intends to amend the constitution again in order to further expand the president's power. Combining the above-mentioned public opinion with the fact that the extreme right-wing elements in France are currently threatening to launch a new military rebellion in North Africa, it can be seen that the right wing of the French ruling group is attempting to use further dictatorialization as a way out of the various contradictions currently existing in France. This quarrel between the heads of the French government, while reflecting the inevitable contradictions within the bourgeoisie, the ruling class intends to expand this contradiction, and there is a great conspiracy in it.

However, the French ruling class, which is an enemy of the people, will have no way out. "Les Échos" editorial on the 11th could not help but admit, "The Fifth Republic is fragile because it is partly built on the fate of one person. After becoming a presidential system, will it not be more fragile?"

    法国政府内部争吵和右翼势力的阴谋
    杨效农
    戴高乐政权内部爆发了一场剧烈的争吵。这场争吵发生在总理德勃雷及其亲信同财政部长比内之间。它充分暴露了戴高乐上台后法国政府内部的重大分歧。
    被巴黎资产阶级报纸形容为“严重政治危机”的争吵，从表面看来，反映了法国不同垄断集团对下述三个计划存在着分歧：
    第一，德勃雷等人主张建立一个政府财政机构，例如银行，来掌管法国落后地区的“工业化和发展”以及对小企业的“改变”，比内则反对；
    第二，德勃雷等人主张建立一个由政府控制的石油公司，负责撒哈拉石油的开采、分配和销售，比内也反对；
    第三，德勃雷等人主张修改法国现行公司法，规定：雇用五十名以上雇员的私人公司的管理部门，将有四分之一的人员由工会选举的代表参加，国家亦将指派代表参加，比内同样地也加以反对。
    但是，这场争吵包含的意义远远超出上述的范围，它实质上反映了法国统治阶级内部，法国统治阶级与国际垄断集团特别是美、英石油垄断组织，以及法国统治阶级与法国广大人民之间矛盾的激化与表面化。
    从法国统治集团内部来说，这场争吵反映了作为戴高乐政权后台支柱的法国新兴石油与原子动力垄断集团同传统的老牌垄断集团争权夺利的矛盾，新兴垄断集团企图借“国家资本主义”之名，将财政经济大权夺到手中。
    法国新兴石油垄断集团同戴高乐政权和戴高乐的政党“保卫新共和联盟”有着极为密切的关系，他们企图借助自己掌握的政权，运用国家财力进一步加速资本的集中过程，形成强有力的垄断势力，并从而创造向外扩张的有利条件。戴高乐政府中的武装部队部部长居约马、工商部长让内，都是该集团的代表。他们所设想的发展落后地区及改变小企业的政策正是这种意图的反映。但是，这种政策遇到了代表传统垄断集团利益的比内的反对，这部分人担心新兴垄断集团借助国家资本壮大起来，将成为自己政治上和经济上的劲敌，因之用各种借口想阻止新兴垄断集团计划的实现，例如，他们反对成立石油提炼及分配公司，说这个公司将过多地“干涉政治”，又说，该公司成立后将同现有的企业竞争。
    从法国统治阶级和国际垄断集团之间的关系看，这场争吵正反映出历史上控制着法国石油提炼和销售网的国际垄断资本，力图继续垄断法国石油企业，同法国新兴石油垄断集团极力想排挤上述势力的矛盾。
    法国现有炼油能力大部控制在国际石油垄断组织手中，如壳牌公司、英国石油公司和埃索石油公司即占其中64．7％，法国石油公司虽然掌握有上述炼油能力的四分之一，但是这家公司在中东的伊拉克及伊朗石油公司中有股份，因之它对提炼中东石油兴趣很大，而法国政府新买下的原来美国德士古公司在法国的一个炼油厂，炼油能力只有法国全部炼油能力的3．5％。因此，法国政府竭力想成立一个由它直接控制的大规模的公司，来扩展法国的石油生产。至于销售网，国际石油垄断组织几乎控制了全部市场，法国政府已买下的这个公司只占4％。
    显然，法国新兴石油垄断资本打算利用国家资本，成立一个石油垄断组织，集中法国一切独立的炼油及销售系统，以便能控制法国炼油及分配系统的10％到15％，以便借此向国际垄断集团讨价还价，并且在“共同市场”内取得石油销售的有利地位。这种活动引起了国际石油卡特尔的不安。比内对德勃雷计划的反对，正是反映了同国际石油集团有联系的法国老牌垄断集团对新兴的想独占法国石油市场、并进一步渗入西欧市场的石油集团之间的矛盾。
    在法国统治阶级与法国人民之间，由于法国政府实行了向劳动人民开刀的政策，一年来赋税增加，物价上涨，工资冻结，民用支出缩减，不仅是工人和农民，就是中间阶层如小商人、职员、教授、学生等，对法国政府的财政经济政策的不满都在日益增强。面对这种日益增长的人民压力，法国统治集团既要平息人民的愤怒，又想寻找借口让人民紧缩消费，忍受剥削，于是便打算把过去政策所带来的严重后果的责任推到比内身上，以转移人民的愤怒。近来，每当劳动人民要求增加工资，有关各部即派人去找比内，同时这些部在回答要求增加工资的工会代表时，都把责任往财政部头上推，由此可以看出这个趋向。同时，法国政府也想以略为增加工资、实行所谓工人代表参加管理部门的“劳资合作”作为缓和阶级斗争的手腕，企图借此换取法国人民为法国的经济扩张、亦即为新兴垄断集团的利润作出新的牺牲。
    在这种政治形势下，一种新的值得注视的迹象正在法国出现，即法国当权的统治集团正打算利用目前出现的危机作为走向进一步独裁的阶梯。巴黎传说，戴高乐已准备利用这个时机将财政大权直接控制在自己和自己的亲信手中。“十字架报”预言，“在危机威胁我们的时候，议会的权力可能被停止”。“回声报”也透露，戴高乐打算将宪法再作修改，以便进一步扩大总统的权力。把上述舆论同法国极右翼分子目前在北非扬言要发动新的军事叛乱结合起来，可以看出：法国统治集团中的右派正妄图以进一步的独裁化，作为摆脱法国目前所存在的各种矛盾的出路，这次法国政府头头的争吵，固然反映了资产阶级内部不可避免的矛盾，然而统治阶级却有意扩大这种矛盾，其中就大有阴谋存在了。
    但是，以人民为敌的法国统治阶级是不会有什么出路的，“回声报”11日的社论也不能不承认，“第五共和国是脆弱的，因为它部分建立在一个人的命运上，在变成了总统制之后，它不是会更加脆弱吗？”
