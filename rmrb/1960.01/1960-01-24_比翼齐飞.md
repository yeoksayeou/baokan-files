    Flying Wing to Wing
    Wang Pu
    Like heavy industry, China's light industry achieved another great leap forward in 1959. In that year, the output of major products such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, salt, and machine-made paper reached or exceeded the targets set for 1962 in the Second Five-Year Plan, completing the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. In 1959, the output value of light industry increased by 34% compared to 1958, while heavy industry increased by 43.3% compared to 1958, with light and heavy industries flying wing to wing at high speed. This year is a year in which the Chinese people continue to hold high the red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune to continue to leap forward. As one leg of industry, light industry must also advance at high speed, continue to fly wing to wing with heavy industry, and together with agriculture, enable the entire national economy to develop rapidly and proportionately.
    The high-speed development of heavy industry and agriculture not only requires the high-speed development of light industry, but also creates technical and raw material conditions for the high-speed development of light industry. Like heavy industry, light industry must solve the problem of production capacity and the problem of raw materials and materials in order to develop at high speed. The utilization rate of light industrial equipment in China has been continuously improving over the years. However, many industries still have considerable potential, which is sufficient to ensure the needs of the current high-speed development. For those with high equipment utilization rates needing to build new factories, heavy industry also has more power than in the past to provide equipment. That is to say, from the perspective of production capacity, light industry has the conditions to continue to fly wing to wing with heavy industry, and it can be said to be entirely possible.
    70% of the raw materials and materials for light industry come from rural areas. The establishment of the People's Communes and the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production have made it possible to provide more raw materials and materials for light industry. In 1959, the People's Communes used their powerful strength to overcome severe natural disasters unseen for decades. Not only did grain and cotton increase by 8% and 14.76% respectively on the basis of the extraordinary bumper harvest in 1958, but the output of soybeans, vegetables, peanuts, sugar cane, sugar beets, fruits, flue-cured tobacco, etc. also increased to varying degrees. Forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery also developed greatly; the "small autumn harvest" movement of collecting wild plants also achieved great results. This created good raw material conditions for the continued high-speed development of light industry.
    At present, in addition to fully utilizing agricultural and animal product raw materials, light industrial enterprises must also widely collect various wild plants and animals and collect all usable light industrial raw materials. This is one aspect. On the other hand, it is also necessary to build subsidiary workshops or factories that produce raw materials according to the needs of production in a self-reliant manner, and to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements on a large scale to increase labor productivity. In this way, the output of light industry will likely increase, the quality will likely improve, and the expansion of variety will be guaranteed. Light industry production must also carry out the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products and wild plants on a large scale, so as to make multiple use of one thing and make the best use of everything, in order to better meet the growing needs of the people's lives.
    The situation is infinitely good, and it is certain that light industry can fly wing to wing with heavy industry. Light industrial workers must go all out, take advantage of the continuous great leap forward in 1958 and 1959, and forge ahead bravely to create greater glorious achievements in 1960 together with heavy industry and agriculture.

    比翼齐飞

    我国轻工业跟重工业一样，在1959年又实现了大跃进。在这一年里，棉纱、棉布、盐、机制纸等主要产品产量已达到或者超过了第二个五年计划规定的1962年的指标，提前三年完成了第二个五年计划。1959年轻工业产值比1958年增长34％，重工业比1958年增长43．3％，轻工业跟重工业在高速度地比翼齐飞着。今年是我国人民继续高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗持续跃进的一年。作为工业中一条腿的轻工业，也必须高速度前进，继续跟重工业比翼齐飞，并和农业一起，使整个国民经济既高速度又按比例地飞跃发展。
    重工业、农业的高速度发展，不仅要求轻工业一起高速度发展，而且也给轻工业的高速度发展创造了技术和原料的条件。跟重工业一样，轻工业要高速度地发展，一要解决生产能力的问题，二要解决原料、材料的问题。我国轻工业设备的利用率，历年都在不断提高。但是，许多行业仍然有相当大的潜在力量，足以保证当前高速度发展的需要。设备利用率已经很高而需要建设新厂的，重工业也比过去有了更多的力量能够提供设备了。这就是说，从生产能力方面讲，轻工业继续跟重工业比翼齐飞，是有条件的，也可以说是完全可能的。
    轻工业的原料、材料，70％来自农村。人民公社的成立，农业生产的大跃进，已有可能为轻工业提供更多的原料、材料。1959年，人民公社以它的强大力量，战胜了几十年来未曾有过的严重自然灾害，不仅粮食、棉花在1958年特大丰收的基础上分别增长了8％和14．76％，而且大豆、蔬菜、花生、甘蔗、甜菜、水果、烤烟等的产量都有不同程度的增长，林、牧、副、渔业也都有了很大发展；收集野生植物的“小秋收”运动也获得了很大成绩。这就为轻工业的继续高速度发展创造了良好的原料材料的条件。
    在当前，轻工业企业除了充分利用农作物和畜产品原料外，还要广泛收集各种野生的植物和动物，收集一切可以利用的轻工业原料。这是一方面。另一方面，还要根据生产的需要，自力更生地建立起生产原料材料的附属车间或工厂，并且大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，以提高劳动生产率。这样，轻工业的产量，就有可能增加，质量也有可能提高，花色品种的扩大，也就有了保证。轻工业生产，还要大搞农副产品和野生植物的综合利用，作到一物多用，物尽其用，以便更好地满足人民生活日益增长的需要。
    形势无限好，轻工业跟重工业比翼齐飞是可以肯定的。轻工业职工一定要鼓足干劲，乘1958和1959年连续大跃进之胜奋勇前进，在1960年同重工业、农业共同创造更大的光辉成绩吧。
