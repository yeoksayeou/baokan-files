The nationwide inspection of water conservancy projects is underway. Hebei Province has launched a province-wide water conservancy inspection involving one million people. Guizhou Province has adopted a method of combining efforts from top to bottom, with inspections organized from the province, special districts, counties, all the way down to the people's communes and management districts. During the inspection, various localities are paying close attention to the quality of the projects, requiring that the quality of each project meet the flood control standards and withstand the test of the flood season. When problems are discovered during the inspection, they are immediately resolved. For example, Guangsi County in Guangdong Province discovered that six out of the 69 completed projects did not meet the quality requirements, and immediately organized 2,500 people to rush a two-day "make-up lesson." In Hubei, due to excessive rain and snow recently, the moisture content of the soil material in a few construction sites was too high, and the compaction was insufficient, resulting in slightly lower project quality, which is now being remedied. These situations show that the local Party committees attach great importance to the water conservancy inspection and the quality issue, which is entirely correct.

Judging from the water conservancy movement since last winter and this spring, the issue of high efficiency and high quality has aroused widespread attention. In just over two months since the start of construction, more than 16 billion cubic meters of earth and stone have been completed nationwide, and the quality of most of the projects meets the design standards, with only a few projects whose quality does not fully meet the requirements. The current task of water conservancy construction is to further implement the fundamental principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, to improve both construction efficiency and project quality.

Is it possible to achieve both high efficiency and high quality? There are two different views on this issue. One view is to completely oppose high efficiency and high quality, believing that "high efficiency cannot achieve high quality" and "slow work produces fine products." This is an incorrect view. The other view is that high efficiency and high quality are a unity of opposites, and high efficiency can completely achieve high quality. This is the correct view. The contradiction between high efficiency and high quality that exists in some situations can be resolved. The key to resolving this contradiction lies in fully mobilizing the masses, improving quality while improving efficiency, and establishing certain responsibility systems and inspection and acceptance systems. By doing so, we will definitely be able to achieve both high efficiency and high quality. Whether a water conservancy project can play a role quickly depends on both the level of efficiency and the quality of the project. Only by building quickly and well can we benefit well and benefit quickly. The six large reservoirs, Miyun, Gangnan, Huangbizhuang, Wangkuai, Xidayang, and Hengshanling, built in Hebei Province after the people's communes were established, have twenty-six times the total earth and stone volume of the Guanting Reservoir built in 1954, and seventy times the earth volume of the Guanting Dam. Because the Party committees at the construction sites fully mobilized the masses, vigorously promoted tool reforms, and vigorously promoted technological innovations, they completed the first phase of the reservoir project in less than a year, completing tens of millions of cubic meters of earth and stone engineering; not only was the construction speed amazing, but also the project quality was very high. For example, Miyun Reservoir took more than 180,000 soil and sand samples from the main dam and auxiliary dam in the past year, with each sample representing an average of 77 cubic meters. The test results showed that the total average qualified rate reached 98.9%, which fully met the design standards and construction specifications. Therefore, after the first phase of the six major reservoirs was completed, they stored more than 5 billion cubic meters of floodwater, which greatly helped ensure the safety of large cities such as Beijing and Tianjin, as well as agricultural production and the lives and property of the people in the vast plains. This is a vivid proof that high efficiency and high quality can be completely unified.

Just as good and fast can be unified, good and economical can also be unified. Every construction site must strive for both good quality and economy, and strive for savings from design to construction. First of all, the design should be rational. A rational design can save the country a lot of manpower, materials, and financial resources. The Feisha River Reservoir construction site in Yingshan County, Hubei Province, repeatedly revised the dam design based on the principle of "using local materials and designing according to the materials," changing the clay core wall earth and stone composite dam to a clay core wall sand shell dam, and vigorously promoted technological innovation and tool reform during the construction process. As a result, 375 tons of cement, 35 tons of steel, more than 2 million yuan in funds, and more than 3 million standard workdays were saved, while also ensuring the quality of the project. Therefore, not only should the design be done well before construction, trying to make the design meet both quality standards and the principle of economy, but also the design should be checked while building after construction. If any inconsistencies are found, they should be revised in time to ensure the quality of the project without affecting the progress of the project. Under the principle of ensuring quality, steel and cement should be used as little as possible or not at all if they can be replaced by substitutes, and steel and cement should not be used if they are not needed. Of course, key projects and main projects that require the use of steel and cement to ensure quality and project safety should still be used, and quality standards cannot be lowered by one-sidedly emphasizing economy.

While striving to improve efficiency, we must educate the broad masses and cadres on the principle of "quality first for a century-long plan," and explain the relationship between water conservancy construction and national economic construction, agricultural production, and the lives and property of the people, so that everyone participating in water conservancy construction recognizes that the quality issue is a matter of great political and economic significance, related to the effectiveness of national construction and the safety of the people, thereby establishing a strong concept of ensuring quality. Only by recognizing the importance of quality ideologically will we do everything possible to ensure quality. At the same time, counties and communes should establish red flags and pacesetters that combine high efficiency and high quality as examples for the broad masses to learn from; and organize visits and comparisons to promote the development of the high efficiency and high quality movement.

"Technical disclosure" is also an effective way to ensure project quality; this is to tell the masses the construction technical standards and quality requirements, so that the masses understand what standards the work should meet to be considered qualified, and also understand how to do it to ensure quality. For example, for the river-blocking dam of a reservoir, attention should be paid to doing a good job in cleaning the base, and tree roots, turf, silt, and gravel should be completely removed, and waterproof walls, anti-seepage curtains, or coverings should be made according to the design to prevent future leakage from the bottom of the dam. Special attention should be paid to the junction of the dam body and the mountain slope, and humus, turf, tree roots, etc. should be removed. If it is an earth dam, the slopes on both sides should not be dug into terraces, but should be combined with the dam body with inclined and flat surfaces. The dam must be compacted firmly layer by layer. After the masses master the technology, they will be able to do it quickly and well.

In addition to conducting quality education and technical disclosure, a certain inspection and acceptance system should also be established. All larger projects should establish on-site laboratories as much as possible. Ideological education and technical education work must be coordinated with a certain scientific experiment and inspection and acceptance system to ensure that quality requirements are reliably guaranteed. With ideological education and a scientific experiment and inspection and acceptance system, the masses' sense of responsibility for ensuring project quality will be strengthened, and they can supervise and help each other to meet quality standards; if the standards are not met after inspection, they should be resolutely reworked. When formulating the inspection and acceptance system, the combination of leaders, technical personnel, and the masses should be implemented. That is to say, on the one hand, leaders and technical personnel should study and formulate project quality inspection and acceptance standards, and on the other hand, they should mobilize the masses to fully discuss and let the masses put forward opinions and methods based on specific work conditions. The combination of the three parties can make the system more perfect and more practical. At the same time, because the system is formulated by the masses themselves, its implementation will be more resolute. When implementing the inspection and acceptance system, the combination of top-down and bottom-up inspection should also be adopted, that is, the combination of professional personnel inspection and mass self-inspection. In this way, it is possible to ensure that no item is missed and no checkpoint is relaxed, so that the project quality can be reliably guaranteed. The Sanmenxia Dam project achieved both high efficiency and high quality despite the large workload and short construction period, because they relied on the masses and mobilized the masses to find ways to ensure quality. For example, in terms of concrete pouring, the masses came up with effective methods of fixing positions and checking the gates, and formulated systems such as handover system, responsibility system, and inspection system. Therefore, among the broad masses, everyone asked questions, every shift checked, and looked everywhere, correcting mistakes and encouraging no mistakes, effectively ensuring the quality of the project. The experience of Sanmenxia is worthy of attention in various places.

### 工效要高，质量要好

    工效要高，质量要好
    全国水利工程大检查正在进行。河北省已经在全省范围内，开展一百万人的水利大检查。贵州省采取上下结合的办法，由省、专、县一直到人民公社、管理区，都组织了检查。各地在检查中很注意工程的质量，要求每个工程质量都能达到拦洪标准，经得起汛期考验。各地在检查中发现问题，立即解决。例如广东广四县发现已完成的六十九项工程中，有六项不合质量要求，便立即组织二千五百人突击“补课”两天。湖北少数工地因近来雨雪过多，土料含水量过大，夯压不够，工程质量稍差，现在正在加以补救。这些情况说明，各地党委对水利大检查很重视，对质量问题很重视，这是完全正确的。
    从去冬今春水利运动的情况看来，高工效和高质量问题已经引起普遍注意。开工仅仅两个多月，全国就已完成土石方一百六十多亿公方，工程质量绝大部分合乎设计标准，只有少数工程的质量还不完全符合要求。当前水利建设的任务就是要进一步贯彻多快好省的根本原则，既要提高施工效率，又要提高工程质量。
    能不能做到工效又高质量又好呢？对这个问题，有两种不同的看法，一种看法是：把高工效和高质量完全对立起来，认为“高工效就不能高质量”、“慢工才能出好活”。这是不正确的看法。另一种看法是：高工效和高质量是对立的统一，高工效完全能够高质量。这是正确的看法。高工效和高质量在某种情况下存在的矛盾，是可以解决的。解决这个矛盾的关键，就在于充分发动群众，在提高工效的同时提高质量，并且制订一定的责任制度和检查验收制度，这样做了，就一定能够做到既有高工效又有高质量。一项水利工程能不能快一点发挥作用，既决定于工效的高低，也决定于质量的好坏。只有修得快又修得好，才能受益好、受益快。河北省在人民公社化后修建的密云、岗南、黄壁庄、王快、西大洋和横山岭六个大型水库，比1954年修成的官厅水库土石方总量大二十六倍，比官厅大坝土方大七十倍。由于工地党委充分发动了群众，大闹工具改革，大闹技术革新，在不到一年的时间里，就完成了水库的第一期工程，完成了几千万立方米的土石方工程量；不但建设速度惊人，而且工程质量很高，如密云水库一年来主坝、副坝共取各种土料和砂料试样十八万多个，平均每个试样代表七十七方，检验结果总平均合格率达到98．9％，完全达到了设计标准和施工规范的要求。因此，六大水库在建成第一期工程后，就拦蓄了五十多亿立方米的洪水，大大有利于保证北京、天津等大城市和广大平原地区的农业生产及人民生命财产的安全。这就是高工效和高质量能够完全统一的生动证明。
    正像好和快是可以统一的一样，好和省也是可以统一的。各个工地都要做到又好又省，从设计到施工都应当力求节约。首先要求设计作得合理。设计合理，就可以为国家节省大量的人力、物力和财力。湖北应山县飞沙河水库工地，根据“就地取材，因材设计”的原则，对大坝设计反复进行了修改，将粘土心墙土沙石组合坝改为粘土心墙沙壳坝，并在施工过程中大闹技术革新和工具改革，结果，就节约了水泥三百七十五吨，钢筋三十五吨，资金二百多万元，标准工三百多万个，而且也保证了工程质量。因此，不但在施工以前要做好设计，尽量使设计既合质量标准又合节约的原则，就是在施工以后，也应该一边修建一边检查设计。发现有不合要求的地方就要及时进行修改，做到既保证工程质量，又不影响工程进度。在保证质量的原则下，凡是能够用代用品代替的就要尽量少用或不用钢筋、水泥，凡是不需要用的就坚决不用钢筋、水泥。当然，必需要用钢筋、水泥才能确保质量和工程安全的枢纽工程和主体工程，还是应当用，不能片面强调节约而降低质量标准。
    在努力提高工效的同时，我们一定要在广大群众和干部中，进行“百年大计，质量第一”的教育，说明水利建设和国家经济建设、农业生产及人民生命财产的关系，使每个参加水利建设的人都认识到质量问题是具有重大政治意义和经济意义的问题，关系到国家建设的效果和人民的安全，从而树立起保证质量的坚强观念。只有从思想上认识了质量的重要，才会千方百计去保证质量。同时，县县社社都应当树立高工效和高质量相结合的红旗和标兵，作为广大群众学习的榜样；并组织参观评比，促进高工效高质量运动的开展。
    “技术交底”，也是保证工程质量的一个有效办法；这就是把施工技术标准、对质量的要求告诉群众，使群众明白什么工作应当达到什么标准才算合格，还要明白应该如何做才能保证质量。比如水库的拦河大坝，就要注意把清理基底的工作做好，树根、草皮、淤泥、碎石都应当彻底清除，并且根据设计，作好防水墙、防渗帷幕或铺盖等，以免将来坝底渗漏。坝身和山坡的结合处要特别注意，要把腐植土、草皮、树根等清除干净。如果是土坝，两边山坡不要挖成台阶式，应当用斜面和平面与坝体结合。大坝一定要层层夯压坚实。群众掌握技术以后，就一定能做到又快又好。
    除了进行质量教育和技术交底以外，还应当建立一定的检查验收制度。一切较大的工程，都应该尽可能建立工地试验室。思想教育和技术教育工作必须配合一定的科学试验和检查验收制度，才能使质量要求得到切实可靠的保证。有了思想教育又有了科学的试验和检查验收制度，群众对保证工程质量的责任心就会加强，可以互相督促和互相帮助，达到质量标准；经过检查不符合标准的，应当坚决返工重做。在制定检查验收制度的时候，要实行领导人员技术人员和群众三结合。就是说一方面领导和技术人员要研究制定工程质量检查验收标准，一方面要发动群众充分讨论，由群众根据具体工作情况提出意见和办法。三方面结合，就可以使制度更加完善、更加切合实际，同时，因为制度是群众自己参加制定的，执行起来就会更加坚决。在执行检查验收制度时，也要采取自上而下与自下而上的检查相结合，就是专业人员检查和群众自行检查相结合。这样，就可以做到不遗漏一个项目，不放松任何一道关口，使工程质量得到切实可靠的保证。三门峡大坝工程在工程量大、施工期短的情况下，做到了既高工效，又高质量，就因为他们依靠群众、发动群众一齐来设法保证质量。如在混凝土浇筑方面，群众就想办法采取了定部位、把关口的有效办法，并制定了交接班制、责任制、检查制等制度，因而在广大群众中，普遍做到了会会问、班班查、处处看，有错必纠，无错加勉，切实保证了工程质量。三门峡的经验，值得各地重视。
