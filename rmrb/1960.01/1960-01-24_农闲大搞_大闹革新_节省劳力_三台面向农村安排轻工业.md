According to Sichuan Daily News: Santai County, Sichuan Province, has adopted the principle of "minor efforts during the busy season, major efforts during the slack season," orienting itself towards agriculture and diversified operations to actively arrange light industry, with remarkable results.

Santai County's light industry has only developed in the past two years. They have utilized abundant resources and relied on their own efforts to establish a network of factories. For example, the county is full of Miscanthus sinensis, so paper mills, pulp mills, and wild fiber processing factories have been widely established. With abundant kaolin and bittern, ceramic factories, fertilizer plants, and salt factories have been built. In coordination with the agricultural harvest, almost every commune and team has built wineries, starch factories, and feed processing plants. In order to save rural labor, daily necessities processing factories such as sewing and shoe making have been established everywhere.

In order to adapt to the needs of this year's major agricultural development, the relevant leaders of Santai County have put forward higher requirements for further development of light industry. According to the new requirements, it is necessary not only to increase production, but also to ensure that products are of high quality, inexpensive, durable, and diverse in variety. To this end, a plan has been proposed to further consolidate and improve the small local groups and small foreign groups of light industry. It was decided that this year, on the one hand, we will vigorously grasp the development of agricultural and sideline products; on the other hand, we will rectify, consolidate, and improve the existing light industrial plants. Starting from the existing foundation, we will carry out a technical innovation movement, promote advanced experience, vigorously develop "local machines" made of iron, wood, and stone, rely on our own efforts, and gradually transform the existing "small local groups" into "small foreign groups" to achieve mechanized and semi-mechanized production. At the same time, improve enterprise management to achieve increased production without increasing manpower, or reduced manpower and increased production.

In order to closely coordinate with the agricultural season and the raw material harvest season, and better support agricultural production, adhering to the principle of "minor efforts during the busy season, major efforts during the slack season," all light industrial enterprises in the county have been lined up. Year-round production arrangements have been made for industries mainly engaged in professional production such as salt production and papermaking. A technical innovation movement centered on high work efficiency has been launched in enterprises, mobilizing the masses to promote advanced experience and improve existing equipment, further improving labor productivity. At the same time, the processing of agricultural and sideline products such as winemaking, sugar making, starch, bricks, tiles, and lime, and some commune-run industries have been listed as seasonal production, mainly using slack agricultural time for production. Thanks to the above measures, since the beginning of the year, the county has successively transferred a group of laborers from the industrial front to agricultural production.

  　农闲大搞　大闹革新　节省劳力
    三台面向农村安排轻工业
    据四川日报消息　四川省三台县采取农忙小搞，农闲大搞，面向农业、面向多种经营的方针，积极安排轻工业，效果显著。
    三台县的轻工业是最近两年才发展起来的。他们利用丰富的资源，自力更生，建立起星罗棋布的工厂。如全县有满山遍野的龙须草，就普遍建起了纸厂、纸浆厂、野生纤维加工厂；有丰富的高岭土和盐卤，就建起了陶瓷厂、化肥厂和盐厂；配合农业的丰收，几乎社社队队都建起了酒厂、淀粉厂、饲料加工厂；为了节约农村劳动力，又到处办起了缝纫、制鞋等日用品加工厂。
    为了适应今年农业大发展的需要，三台县有关领导方面，又提出了进一步发展轻工业的更高要求。根据新的要求，不仅要增加产量，还要使产品做到物美价廉，经久耐用，品种多样。为此，提出了进一步巩固提高轻工业小土群、小洋群的规划。决定在今年一方面大抓农副产品的发展；另一方面，对现有轻工业厂进行整顿巩固和提高工作。从现有基础出发，开展技术革新运动，推广先进经验，大搞铁、木、石结构的“土机器”，自力更生，逐步把现有的“小土群”改造为“小洋群”，实现机械化和半机械化生产。同时改善企业管理，作到增产不增人，或者减人又增产。
    为了紧密配合农事季节和原料的收获季节，更好地支援农业生产，本着农忙小搞、农闲大搞的原则，将全县轻工业企业排了队。对制盐、造纸等以专业生产为主的行业，作了常年生产安排。在企业内开展以高工效为中心的技术革新运动，发动群众推广先进经验，改进现有设备，进一步提高劳动生产率。同时，把酿酒、制糖、淀粉、砖瓦、石灰等农副产品加工和一部分社办工业列为季节性生产，主要利用农闲时间进行生产。由于采取了以上措施，开年以来，这个县已先后由工业战线抽出了一批劳动力转入农业生产。
