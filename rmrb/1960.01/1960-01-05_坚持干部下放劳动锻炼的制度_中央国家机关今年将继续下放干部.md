    Adhere to the System of Cadre Downward Labor Training
    Central State Organs Will Continue to Send Cadres Down This Year
    Xinhua News Agency, 4th - The Party Committee of the Central State Organs recently decided that all organs should continue to send a batch of cadres down to the grassroots level for labor training in 1960. The Party organizations within the organs should adhere to this system and strive to have all personnel who should be sent down for training rotated through the program within a few years.
    In 1959, a total of more than 6,400 cadres from the Central State Organs were sent down for labor training. More than 80% of them were sent down to rural people's communes. They were distributed in 27 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and have been working there for nearly a year. The vast majority have received excellent training in labor and grassroots work. They humbly learned from the peasants and achieved the goal of eating, living, and working alongside them, and were praised by the masses. Now, all organs are preparing to gradually recall them to continue their work.
    In order to do a good job in sending cadres down in 1960, the Party Committee of the Central State Organs requires all departments to conscientiously summarize past experiences, and especially to systematically analyze the actual performance of cadres sent down for labor training in the rural socialist revolution movement, in order to improve the organization and guidance of cadres sent down for labor training and the work of ideological transformation. The Party Committee believes that rural people's communes can most comprehensively train cadres, and should become the main direction for cadres to go down for labor training in the future. In particular, they should be planned to be distributed to those places where the work is relatively weak. This will not only help local work, but also greatly benefit the training and transformation of cadres.

    坚持干部下放劳动锻炼的制度
    中央国家机关今年将继续下放干部
    新华社4日讯　中央国家机关党委最近决定，各机关在1960年要继续下放一批干部到基层进行劳动锻炼，机关内党的组织要把这个制度坚持下来，争取在几年内，使应该下放锻炼的人员全部轮流下放锻炼完毕。
    在1959年内，中央国家机关下放劳动锻炼的干部共有六千四百多人，80％以上下放到农村人民公社，他们分布在二十七个省、市和自治区，下放时间已将近一年，绝大多数都在劳动和基层工作中受到了很好的锻炼，他们虚心向农民学习，做到了与农民同吃同住同劳动，受到群众的赞扬。现在，各机关正准备陆续调回他们继续工作。
    为了作好1960年下放干部的工作，中央国家机关党委要求各部门认真总结过去的经验，特别是注意对下放劳动锻炼的干部在农村社会主义革命运动中的实际表现进行系统的分析，以便把组织和指导干部下放劳动锻炼、改造思想的工作提高一步。党委认为，农村人民公社最能全面地锻炼干部，今后应成为干部下放劳动锻炼的主要方向，特别是应该有计划地分布到那些工作比较薄弱的地方去，这样不仅可以帮助地方工作，而且对锻炼改造干部有很大益处。
