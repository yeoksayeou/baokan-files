Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: The continued great leap forward on China's industrial front in 1959 once again demonstrated the tremendous power of the principle of "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward" in industrial construction, ensuring both high-speed and proportional development in all industrial sectors.

In the past year, China's steel production has surged from an annual output of eight million tons to 13.35 million tons. The newly added steel production is more than one million tons higher than the total newly added steel production during the First Five-Year Plan period, and 67% higher than the great leap forward year of 1958 (excluding native steel). This created an unprecedented high speed in the history of China's iron and steel industry. The high speed of increasing steel production from eight million tons to more than thirteen million tons in one year is also unprecedented in any capitalist country. Due to the rapid development of the iron and steel industry, the output value of China's heavy and light industries increased by 43.3% and 34% respectively in the past year compared with 1958. The total output value of the entire industry increased by 39.3% compared with 1958, achieving a continued all-round great leap forward.

First, let's look at heavy industry. The unprecedented high-speed development of the iron and steel industry has primarily provided an increasingly sufficient material foundation for the machinery industry, driving the rapid development of the machinery industry. Now, with the exception of Tibet, all provinces and regions across the country have established iron and steel industries and machinery industries. A complete national industrial system, centered on iron and steel and machinery, with a more rational regional distribution, is rapidly taking shape. Before the great leap forward, the equipment capacity of the machinery industry could not be fully utilized due to insufficient steel supply. However, in 1959, the steel supply received by the machinery industry sector increased by another 65.9% on top of the 67% increase in 1958. Therefore, the utilization rate of metal cutting machine tools nationwide has increased from 65% before the great leap forward to over 80%, and the self-sufficiency rate of China's machinery and equipment has also increased from an average of around 55% during the First Five-Year Plan to over 80%. Due to the rapid development of the iron and steel industry and the subsequent great leap forward in the machinery industry, heavy industrial sectors such as coal, electricity, petroleum, chemicals, cement, and timber harvesting have also received an increasing supply of steel and equipment. In particular, the coal, electricity, petroleum, and chemical sectors within the heavy industry system have received far more steel and machinery equipment each year in the two years of the 1959 and 1958 great leap forward than in any previous year. Therefore, in 1959, the national output of products such as coal, electricity, chemical fertilizers, cement, and timber increased by 18% to 64.4% on top of the great leap forward in 1958. In particular, the development speed of the coal, electricity, chemical, and petroleum industries has been greatly accelerated during the two years of the great leap forward.

The great development of the iron and steel industry has also powerfully driven the all-round leap forward in transportation, and the situation where transportation lags behind the needs of national economic construction is gradually changing. In 1959, the steel allocated to the railway sector by the state increased by another 75% compared with 1958. In particular, the output of steel rails necessary for new railway construction has increased significantly year by year. Due to the guaranteed steel supply, China built more than 8,000 kilometers of railways in the two years of 1958 and 1959. The vehicles and ships produced by the machinery industry sector for the transportation sector have also increased significantly year by year. The railway system has added more than 1,700 locomotives and nearly 30,000 passenger and freight cars since the great leap forward, an increase of more than three times and 88% respectively compared with the total number added during the First Five-Year Plan. Last year, China's self-made automobiles and civilian ships also increased by 21% and 67% respectively compared with 1958. Precisely because of this, in 1959, the freight volume completed by modern means of transportation nationwide was able to increase by another 59% on top of the 54% increase in 1958, achieving a continued great leap forward in the transportation sector.

In the high-speed industrial development with steel as the key link, the development speed of light industry has also been unprecedentedly improved. In the two years of 1959 and 1958, the total output value of light industry has continuously increased by 34% compared with the previous year, which is 2.7 times the average growth rate of the First Five-Year Plan. The output of almost all major light industrial products closely related to people's lives has increased significantly year by year. Taking cotton yarn, sugar, and paper as examples, in 1959, cotton yarn production increased by 2.15 million bales compared with 1958, sugar increased by 230,000 tons, and paper increased by 500,000 tons, an increase of 35%, 26%, and 31% respectively compared with the great leap forward year of 1958. In 1959, the steel obtained by the light industry sector for production and maintenance increased by nearly two times compared with 1958, and the steel used for capital construction increased by nearly one time, which is higher than the growth rate of steel obtained by the heavy industry sector. Taking papermaking and sugar-making equipment as examples, the new equipment capacity added by the light industry sector in the two years of 1959 and 1958 far exceeded the total new equipment capacity added during the First Five-Year Plan. It can be seen from this that, under the guidance of the principle of "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward," the development of the iron and steel industry and the entire heavy industry has not only not squeezed out light industry, but on the contrary, because heavy industry, especially the iron and steel and machinery industries, is providing increasingly sufficient raw materials and machinery equipment for all sectors of the national economy, it has powerfully supported the development of light industry.

Precisely because light industry has greatly accelerated its development speed in the great leap forward, the proportional relationship between the development speed of heavy industry and the development speed of light industry is also more adapted than in the past. During the First Five-Year Plan period, China's heavy industry grew at an average annual rate of 25.4%, and light industry grew at an average annual rate of 12.8%. The development speed of heavy industry was 1.98 times that of light industry. In 1959, heavy industry grew by 43.3%, and light industry grew by 34%. The ratio of the development speed of heavy industry and light industry has narrowed from 1.98 to 1 during the First Five-Year Plan period to 1.27 to 1. The trend of light industry development being more adapted to heavy industry development is becoming increasingly obvious.

The great leap forward in industry was carried out on the basis of the great leap forward in agriculture; the great leap forward in the iron and steel and machinery industries has further supported the development of agriculture, creating conditions for the gradual implementation of the technical transformation of agriculture. According to statistics, the amount of steel supplied by the state for agricultural use in the two years of 1959 and 1958 was more than the total amount supplied during the First Five-Year Plan. Since the great leap forward, the state has also supplied rural areas with irrigation and drainage machinery, tractors, combine harvesters, and trucks, as well as semi-mechanized new-style farm tools and improved farm tools, which greatly exceeds the total amount supplied during the First Five-Year Plan.

Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: In 1959, China's agriculture overcame unprecedentedly severe natural disasters and achieved an all-round increase in production and bumper harvests. The total national grain output reached 540.1 billion jin, an increase of 8% compared with 1958; the total cotton output reached 48.2 million dan, an increase of 14.76%. Both grain and cotton have overfulfilled the targets set for 1962 in the Second Five-Year Plan. The total output of other crops such as soybeans increased by 10% compared with 1958, peanuts increased by 9.2%, flue-cured tobacco increased by 11%, sugarcane increased by 3%, sugar beets increased by 27%, tea increased by 8%, fruits increased by about 20%, and vegetables increased by 100%. There has also been great development in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In 1959, the national afforestation area increased by 7% compared with 1958, pigs increased by 13%, sideline output value increased by more than one time, and aquatic products increased by 23.6%. This is a great victory achieved by the People's Communes in implementing the principle of "taking grain as the key link, making overall arrangements, and diversifying operations."

China has a large population, and since liberation, grain production has always been of paramount importance. With the development of grain production, there is feed for developing animal husbandry, and more cultivated land and labor can be used to grow various cash crops and develop diversified operations. Based on the new situation of large-scale increases in grain and cotton production in 1958 and the realization of communization in rural areas, the Party timely put forward the principle of "taking grain as the key link, making overall arrangements, and diversifying operations" last year, requiring all localities to first ensure the continued increase in grain production, while appropriately growing cash crops and developing diversified operations.

In order to continue to increase grain production, in 1959, the People's Communes across the country, according to the principle of combining multiple planting and multiple harvests with high-yield and multiple harvests, paid attention to grasping the planting area of grain crops during both spring and summer sowing, and strived to improve the yield per unit area based on the experience of high-yield and bumper harvests achieved in 1958. The average yield per mu of grain crops nationwide reached 440 jin calculated based on the cultivated area of grain crops, an increase of 14% compared with 1958; calculated based on the sown area, it reached 330 jin, an increase of 20% compared with 1958.

While ensuring the high-speed development of grain production, cash crops also had appropriate development last year. Many grain-producing areas have strengthened the management of cash crops. The national sesame planting area increased by 3 million mu compared with 1958, soybeans increased by more than 1 million mu, and the area of vegetables increased even more. Hunan Province and Sichuan Province, which used to focus on grain production, also developed the production of cotton, sugarcane, peanuts, and silk last year. In 1958, only a few provinces and regions in Northeast and Northwest China planted sugar beets, while last year, the vast majority of provinces and regions across the country planted them. On the other hand, many concentrated production areas of cash crops also paid attention to grain production last year. Handan Prefecture in Hebei Province, which is rich in cotton, had bumper harvests of both grain and cotton last year. The total cotton output increased by more than 30% compared with 1958, and the total grain output increased by more than 35%. Many mountainous areas also paid attention to grain production while developing diversified operations such as forestry and animal husbandry. Matian Commune in Yongxing County, Hunan Province, reclaimed and restored oil tea forests on the mountains while increasing grain production. This grain-deficient commune not only sold surplus grain last year but also had reserve grain. Last year, the suburban areas of large cities such as Shanghai universally developed the production of vegetables and other non-staple foods, and some have become bases for supplying the cities with vegetables, chickens, ducks, fish, and meat. However, these communes also paid attention to grain production at the same time. As a result, they not only met the vegetable supply for the industrial areas, but also sold surplus grain.

The reason why grain crops and cash crops can be developed simultaneously is mainly due to the overall arrangements of the People's Communes. The People's Communes have a large population, a large land area, and abundant material and financial resources, and have the conditions for comprehensive development. Under their unified planning and overall planning, they can not only plant crops according to local conditions, but also solve the difficulties of labor and time being sacrificed for one thing or another. Last year, the communes, relying on the improvement of labor efficiency, organized various specialized teams to engage in diversified operations while ensuring that there was enough labor for grain production. Therefore, last year, in the severe situation of extremely severe natural disasters, they were not only able to ensure the high-speed development of grain but also achieve an all-round leap forward in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and other agricultural crops.

    1959年国民经济发展实现了高速度和按比例的高度统一
    工业农业并举保证了全面大跃进
    工业以钢为纲，重轻工业和交通运输业项项大发展
    农业以粮为纲，农、林、牧、副、渔五业样样增产丰收
    新华社24日讯　1959年我国工业战线上继续大跃进的胜利，再一次表明“以钢为纲、全面跃进”的方针在工业建设中发挥巨大威力，保证了工业各部门既高速度又按比例的发展。
    在过去的一年中，我国钢产量已经由年产八百万吨跃增到一千三百三十五万吨，新增加的钢产量比第一个五年计划期间新增钢产量的总和还多一百多万吨，比大跃进的1958年又增长67％（不包括土钢），创造了我国钢铁工业发展史上的空前高速度。钢产量在一年内由八百万吨增加到一千三百多万吨，这样的高速度也是任何资本主义国家从来没有过的。由于钢铁工业的迅速发展，去年我国重工业和轻工业的产值，分别比1958年增长43．3％和34％；而整个工业的总产值，则比1958年增长39．3％，实现了继续全面大跃进。
    先看重工业。钢铁工业空前高速度发展，首先为机械工业提供了越来越充分的物质基础，带动了机械工业的飞速发展。现在，除西藏以外，全国各省、区都建立了钢铁工业和机械工业，一个以钢铁和机械为中心的、地区分布更加合理的全国完整的工业体系，正在迅速形成。在大跃进以前由于钢材供应不足，机械工业的设备能力没有得到充分发挥，而在1959年内，机械工业部门得到的钢材供应，在1958年增长67％的基础上又增加了65．9％。因此，现在全国金属切削机床的设备利用率已由大跃进以前的65％提高到80％以上，我国机器设备的自给率也由第一个五年的平均55％左右提高到80％以上。由于钢铁工业的迅速发展和随之而来的机械工业的大跃进，煤炭、电力、石油、化工、水泥、木材采伐等重工业部门，也得到了越来越多的钢材和设备供应。尤其是重工业系统中的煤、电、石油、化工等部门，它们在1959和1958两年中每年得到的钢材和机械设备，都远远超过以往任何一年。因此，1959年全国煤、电、石油、化学肥料、水泥、木材等产品的产量，在1958年大跃进的基础上又增长了18％到64．4％。特别是煤炭、电力和化工、石油工业的发展速度，在两年来的大跃进中大大地加快了。
    钢铁工业的大发展，也有力地带动了交通运输事业的全面跃进，交通运输事业落后于国家经济建设需要的情况，正在逐步改变。1959年国家分配给铁道部门的钢材，比1958年又增加了75％。特别是新建铁路所必需的钢轨，产量逐年大大增加。由于在钢材供应方面得到保证，我国在1958年和1959年两年中修建的铁路有八千多公里。机械工业部门为交通部门生产的车辆、船舶，也逐年地大大增加。铁路系统在大跃进以来新增加的机车有一千七百多台，客货车近三万辆，同第一个五年增加总数相比较，分别增长了三倍多和88％。去年我国自制的汽车和民用船舶，也比1958年分别增加21％和67％。正是因为这样，1959年全国现代运输工具完成的货运量，才能够在1958年增长54％的基础上又提高59％，实现了交通运输事业的继续大跃进。
    在以钢为纲的工业高速度发展中，轻工业的发展速度也空前提高，1959和1958两年来，轻工业总产值连续比前一年增长34％，为第一个五年平均增长速度的二点七倍。几乎所有同人民生活息息相关的主要轻工业品，产量都逐年大大增加。以棉纱、糖、纸为例，1959年棉纱产量比1958年增加二百一十五万件，糖增加二十三万吨，纸增加五十万吨，分别比大跃进的1958年增长了35％、26％和31％。在1959年内，轻工业部门获得的生产和维修用的钢材就比1958年增加将近两倍，基本建设用的钢材增加将近一倍，高于重工业部门获得钢材的增长比例。以造纸和制糖设备为例，轻工业部门在1959和1958两年中新增加的设备能力，远远超过了第一个五年新增设备能力的总和。由此可见，在“以钢为纲、全面跃进”这一方针的指导下，钢铁工业和整个重工业的发展不但没有挤掉轻工业，相反地，由于重工业特别是钢铁、机械工业正在为国民经济各部门提供越来越充分的原料材料和机器设备，却是有力地支援了轻工业的发展。
    正因为轻工业在大跃进中大大加快了发展速度，重工业发展速度和轻工业发展速度的比例关系，也比过去更加适应了。第一个五年计划期间，我国重工业平均每年增长25．4％，轻工业平均每年增长12．8％，重工业发展速度是轻工业的一点九八倍。而在1959年中，重工业增长43．3％，轻工业增长34％，重工业和轻工业发展速度的比例，已经由第一个五年计划期间的一点九八比一缩小到一点二七比一。轻工业发展同重工业发展更相适应的趋势，已经愈来愈明显了。
    工业的大跃进，是在农业大跃进的基础上进行的；钢铁和机械工业的大跃进，也进一步支援了农业的发展，为逐步实行农业的技术改造创造了条件。据统计，在1959和1958两年中，国家供应农业方面使用的钢材，比第一个五年的总和还多。大跃进以来，国家供应农村的排灌机械、拖拉机、联合收割机和载重汽车，以及半机械化的新式农具和改良农具，也大大超过了第一个五年的总和。
    新华社24日讯　1959年我国农业战胜了几十年来没有过的特大自然灾害，获得了全面的增产丰收。全国粮食总产量达五千四百零一亿斤，比1958年增长8％，棉花总产量达四千八百二十万担，增长14．76％，粮棉都已超额完成了第二个五年计划所规定的1962年的指标。其他如大豆总产量比1958年增长10％，花生增长9．2％，烤烟增长11％，甘蔗增长3％，甜菜增长27％，茶叶增长8％，水果增长20％左右，蔬菜增长100％。林、牧、副、渔各业生产也有很大发展。1959年全国造林面积比1958年增加7％，猪增长13％，副业产值增长一倍多，水产品增长23．6％。这是人民公社执行“以粮为纲，全面安排，多种经营”方针所取得的伟大胜利。
    我国人口众多，解放以来，粮食生产一直处于头等重要的地位。粮食生产发展了，就有了发展畜牧业的饲料，才能够以较多的耕地和劳动力来多种经济作物，发展多种经营。根据1958年粮棉大增产和农村实现公社化的新情况，党在去年及时地提出了“以粮为纲，全面安排，多种经营”的方针，要求各地首先保证粮食继续增产，同时适当多种经济作物和发展多种经营。
    为了继续增产粮食，1959年全国人民公社根据多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，在春播和夏播中间都注意抓了粮食作物的种植面积，并在1958年取得成效的高额丰产经验上努力提高了单位面积产量。全国粮食作物的平均亩产量按种粮的耕地面积计算达四百四十斤，比1958年增长14％，按播种面积计算达到了三百三十斤，比1958年增长20％。
    在保证粮食生产高速度发展的同时，去年经济作物也有了适当地发展。不少粮食产区加强了经济作物的经营，全国芝麻种植面积比1958年增加了三百万亩，大豆增加了一百多万亩，蔬菜的面积增加更多。过去以产粮为主的湖南省、四川省去年也发展了棉花、甘蔗、花生、蚕丝等生产。1958年只有东北、西北少数省区种植甜菜，而去年全国绝大多数省区都有所种植。另一方面，去年许多经济作物的集中产区也注意了粮食生产。盛产棉花的河北省邯郸专区去年粮棉双丰收，棉花总产量比1958年增产30％以上，粮食总产量增产35％以上。不少山区在发展林牧等多种经营中也注意了粮食生产。湖南永兴县马田公社在山上一面垦复油茶林，一面增产粮食。使这个缺粮的公社去年不仅卖了余粮而且还有储备粮。去年上海等大城市的近郊区普遍发展了蔬菜等副食品的生产，有的已成为供应城市的蔬菜和鸡、鸭、鱼、肉的基地。但是这些公社仍然同时注意了粮食生产，结果既满足了对工业区的蔬菜供应，又出售了余粮。
    粮食作物和经济作物所以能够同时并举，主要是依靠人民公社的全面安排。人民公社人多、地多，物力、财力雄厚，具有全面发展的条件，在它的统筹安排、全面规划下面，既能因地种植，又解决了劳力、时间顾此失彼的困难。去年公社依靠劳动效率的提高，在保证粮食生产有足够劳动力的情况下，一般公社都组织有各种专业队从事多种经营。因而去年在特大自然灾害的严重情况下，既能保证粮食高速度发展，又能取得林牧副渔和其他农作物同时全面跃进。（附图片）
