    Words of a Pig Farmer
    Zhao Zhen, your old man, am fifty-nine. When I was young, I was a pig farmer. For twenty years in the old society, I broke my back and worried myself grey. Living and dying for the landlord, the landlord and rich men ate like fat pigs, scrutinizing every detail daily. If anything wasn't up to par, "Yellow Wolf" would beat me with a stick. (Note) I suffered all kinds of torment and bitterness. This old man vowed never to be a pig farmer again. After liberation, life improved, and the establishment of the commune brought even more happiness. Like a withered tree blossoming in spring, this old man has a future in pig farming. When the commune established a pig farm, I volunteered to be a pig farmer. Since taking on this line of work, I feel neither tired nor disgusted: During the day, I release the pigs into the wild, taking responsibility for finding feed. In the hot summer, I build bathing pools for the pigs. In the cold winter, I build warm houses for them. When it's cloudy and raining, I revolve around the pig troughs. At night, I sleep beside the pigsty. I diligently carry water and prepare food, busying myself day and night with collecting manure and spreading bedding. When piglets are sick, I act as a "nurse." When sows give birth, I act as a midwife. I raise a total of one hundred and twenty pigs, feeding each one until they are fat and plump. The commune members praise me for raising pigs well, and the Party committee awards me a certificate. My old woman is also happy for me, and the commune members ask me to share my experiences at meetings. Overcome with excitement, tears streamed down my face before I could even speak. If you ask why this old man raises pigs so well, first and foremost, I thank our benefactor, the Communist Party.
    Note: Yellow Wolf is the landlord's nickname.

    养猪手的话
    朝珍我老汉，五十九，年青就是个养猪手，旧社会养猪二十年，累坏了腰，愁白了头，死去活来为地主，地主老财吃的肥猪样，每天光把毛病瞅，要有一点不如意，“黄狼”拿棍把我揍，（注）受尽了折磨，吃尽了苦头，我老汉誓死不当养猪手。解放后，生活好，公社成立更幸福，枯树逢春鲜花开，我老汉养猪有前途，公社成立养猪场，我自报奋勇要当养猪手。自从干上这一行，我不知疲累不嫌脏：白天放猪在野外，寻找饲料我担当，夏天炎热给猪修澡池，冬天寒冷给猪盖温房，天阴下雨跟着猪槽转，夜里睡在猪圈旁，担水调食做的勤，起粪垫圈日夜忙，猪娃有病当“护士”，母猪生仔我把产婆当，养猪大小一百二十头，头头喂的肥又胖。社员夸讲我猪养的好，党委给我发奖状。老伴为我也高兴，社员叫我在会上把经验讲。由于兴奋太过度，话未出口热泪淌。要说我老汉养猪养的好，首先感谢恩人共产党。
    注：黄狼即地主的外号。
