Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 3rd - Newspapers here report that the Albanian Ambassador to Yugoslavia submitted a note to the Yugoslav Secretariat of Foreign Affairs on December 22, 1959, protesting the Yugoslav government's violation of the agreement signed by Albania and Yugoslavia in 1956 regarding water conservancy issues in the border areas. Approximately two-thirds of Albania's land border is adjacent to Yugoslavia, and there are numerous rivers and lakes shared by both countries along the border. In order to jointly utilize these water sources, the two countries signed an agreement in December 1956, in which both parties guaranteed to study and resolve all issues related to water conservancy economics according to the provisions of the agreement, as well as measures and projects that may affect the quality and quantity of water of concern to both or either party. However, Yugoslavia recently unilaterally constructed the Globochica hydroelectric power station on the Black Drin River without consultation with both parties, and carried out soil improvement projects in the marshes on the shores of Lake Ohrid.

The note stated that on March 30, 1959, the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Yugoslav Embassy regarding this matter, resolutely protesting this arbitrary behavior by the South, pointing out that it seriously infringed upon Albania's interests and openly violated the agreement signed by the two countries and international practice. Therefore, it demanded that the Yugoslav government immediately take measures to stop the project. The Yugoslav government insisted on its position in its reply on September 1 of the same year and defended its behavior. The Albanian note pointed out that such sophistry is untenable. The facts prove that the construction of the hydroelectric power station directly and seriously damages the existing water conservancy system of Lake Ohrid and the Black Drin River.

In the note, the Albanian government declared that it reserves the right to demand compensation. The note concluded by stating that because Yugoslavia violated the agreement and, disregarding the repeated warnings of the Albanian government, continues to carry out the construction of the hydroelectric power station, the Albanian government declares that it has the right to build hydroelectric power stations on its own territory to utilize the hydroelectric capacity of Lake Ohrid. All responsibilities for the consequences caused by this measure shall be borne by the Yugoslav government.

    南斯拉夫破坏两国边境水利问题协定
    阿尔巴尼亚向南当局提出抗议
    新华社地拉那3日电　此间报纸报道：阿尔巴尼亚驻南斯拉夫公使在1959年12月22日向南斯拉夫外交秘书处递交了一份照会，抗议南斯拉夫政府破坏阿南两国在1956年签订的关于边境地区水利问题的协定。阿尔巴尼亚的陆地边界线约有三分之二与南斯拉夫接壤，边境上有许多河流和湖泊为两国所共有。为了共同利用这些水源，两国曾于1956年12月签订了一项协定，双方保证根据协定的条文研究和解决有关水利经济的一切问题，以及可能影响双方或其中一方所关心的水的质量和数量的变化的措施和工程。但是，南斯拉夫近来未经双方协商就擅自在黑德林河上修建格洛鲍齐泽水电站，并在波格腊德次湖畔的沼地进行土壤改良工程。
    照会中说，1959年3月30日阿尔巴尼亚外交部曾就这件事照会南斯拉夫公使馆，坚决抗议南方的这种专横行为，指出这严重地侵犯了阿尔巴尼亚的利益，公开地违反了两国签订的协定和国际惯例，因此要求南斯拉夫政府立即采取措施停止这项工程。南斯拉夫政府在同年9月1日的复照中坚持其立场，并为其行为辩解。阿尔巴尼亚照会中指出，这种强辩是站不住脚的。事实证明，兴建水电站的工程直接地严重地损害了波格腊德次湖和黑德林河现有的水利的系统。
    阿尔巴尼亚政府在照会中，声明保留要求赔偿的权利。照会最后说，由于南斯拉夫违反协定和不顾阿尔巴尼亚政府的一再警告，仍然继续进行水电站的兴建工程，阿尔巴尼亚政府声明，它有权在本国领土上兴建水电站，以利用波格腊德次湖的水电能力。这一措施所引起的结果，其一切责任应由南斯拉夫政府来承担。
