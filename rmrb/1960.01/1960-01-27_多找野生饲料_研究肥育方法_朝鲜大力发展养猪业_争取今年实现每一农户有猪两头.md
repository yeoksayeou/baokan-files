    Find More Wild Fodder, Research Fattening Methods
    Korea Vigorously Develops Pig Farming
    Striving to Achieve Two Pigs Per Farm Household This Year
    Northern Korea's agricultural cooperatives are actively developing pig farming. By the end of last year, the total number of pigs in northern Korea reached more than 1.61 million, averaging 1.6 pigs per farm household, an increase of 12% compared to the end of 1958. Currently, farmers in various regions are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee's plenary session in December last year, actively working to achieve one to two pigs per *町步* (approximately 15 *亩*) of cultivated land and two pigs per farm household within one year.
    In developing pig farming, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have achieved many outstanding results. Jang Jung-deok, a member of the Bukseong Agricultural Cooperative in Seonggan County, Jagang Province, made the 15 sows he was responsible for give birth to 284 piglets last year, raising 268 of them. He regularly cleaned the pigsty and prepared good feed to keep the sows healthy. He also successfully experimented with methods to make sows become fertile earlier.
    Agricultural cooperatives in various regions have responded to the Labor Party's call to "exchange grass for meat," creating many ways to raise pigs using wild feed such as grass, wild vegetables, and leaves. The Gusan Agricultural Cooperative in Ningbian County, North Pyongan Province, raised 650 public pigs entirely on wild feed from the mountains without using any grain. Each farm household also raised an average of two pigs. Recently, they have also cultivated wild feed on 200 *町步* of mountain land and wasteland to ensure they can raise even more pigs.
    Scientific researchers are also working hard to explore and research advanced methods of pig farming. Teachers and students from the Animal Teaching and Research Office of the Biology Department of Kim Il-sung University recently experimented with using thyroid removal to fatten pigs at the New Stream Farm, with good results. They removed the thyroid glands of 30 pigs, and they gained an average of 1.5 kilograms of meat per day, with the fastest growth reaching 6 kilograms in one day. Now they are studying the use of electricity to eliminate thyroid function, instead of the complicated surgery of thyroid removal. (Picture attached)

    多找野生饲料  研究肥育方法
    朝鲜大力发展养猪业
    争取今年实现每一农户有猪两头
    朝鲜北部各地农业社积极发展养猪事业，到去年年底为止，朝鲜北部猪的总数达到一百六十一万多头，平均每一农户有一点六头，比1958年年底增加了12％。目前各地农民又热烈响应朝鲜劳动党中央去年12月全体会议的号召，为在一年内达到每町步（合十五市亩）耕地有猪一头到两头、每个农户有猪两头而积极行动起来。
    各地农业社在发展养猪的事业中，创造了许多优异的成绩。慈江道城干郡北城农业社社员张仲德在去年一年中使他负责养的十五头母猪产了二百八十四头小猪，养活了其中二百六十八头。他经常打扫猪圈，准备很好的饲料，使母猪经常保持健康。他还试验成功了使母猪提前发情的办法。
    各地农业社响应劳动党提出的用草换肉的号召，创造了许多用草、野菜和树叶等野生饲料养猪的办法。平安北道宁边郡龟山农业社完全不用粮食光用山上的野生饲料养了六百五十头公养猪，每个农户还平均饲养了两头。最近他们又在二百町步的山地和荒地上培植了野生饲料，保证养更多的猪。
    科学研究人员也努力探索和研究养猪的先进方法。金日成综合大学生物系动物教研室的师生们最近在新溪农场试验用切除甲状腺的办法来使猪长肥，得到了很好的效果。他们给三十头猪切除了甲状腺，平均一天长一点五公斤肉，其中长肉最快的一天长了六公斤。现在他们正在研究用电来消除甲状腺的机能，以代替切除甲状腺的复杂手术。（附图片）
