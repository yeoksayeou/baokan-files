Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, 15th - The woolen textile factory, built with China's assistance to Mongolia and equipped with modern machinery, was officially handed over today and put into production.

This factory is one of the projects aided by China to Mongolia without compensation, according to the agreement signed in 1956 regarding China's economic and technical assistance to Mongolia.

This factory can produce more than 1.11 million meters of overcoating, uniform cloth, tweed, and blankets annually. Construction of the factory began in August 1957 and was completed in November 1959. After trial production, it was proven that the product quality and equipment performance meet the design requirements.

This afternoon, a mass rally was held to celebrate the completion of the woolen textile factory.

Mongolian party and government leaders Tsedenbal, Sambuu, Tsende, Molomjamts, and others, as well as foreign diplomatic envoys, attended the celebration.

Mongolian First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Molomjamts and the head of the Chinese government delegation, Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia Xie Fusheng, delivered speeches at the meeting.

Molomjamts said that Chinese workers, in assisting Mongolia's construction, implemented the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical," shortening the construction time and saving funds. The woolen textile factory put into production today will not only better supply the people with needed products, but will also lay a good foundation for the development of Mongolia's woolen textile industry.

Xie Fusheng continued by saying that on the basis of the consolidation and development of the eternal fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people, the friendly mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries is developing at an unprecedented speed. The official handover and use of the new woolen textile factory is a new fruit of the friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people and is also the internationalist obligation that the Chinese people should fulfill.

The handover signing ceremony for the woolen textile factory was held here this morning. The head of the Chinese government delegation, Xie Fusheng, and the head of the Mongolian government delegation, Luvsanchoymbol, signed the handover certificates separately.

Subsequently, the Presidium of the Great People's Hural and the Council of Ministers of Mongolia awarded medals, badges, and certificates to 104 Chinese workers.

In the evening, the head of the Mongolian government delegation held a reception.
