    "Three-Way Combination" Accelerates Technological Innovation
    Li Gang, Head of the Technology Section and Engineer of the Engine Workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant

    Following the direction pointed out by the Party, we bid farewell to 1959 and welcomed 1960 on the road of the Great Leap Forward. The past year has left behind many indelible glorious achievements, and the new year unveils a beautiful picture.

    In 1959, our engine workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, like other brother units, underwent great changes: in terms of product variety, it changed from a workshop specializing in the manufacture of "Liberation" brand automobile engines to a workshop manufacturing three different models of engines, including "Liberation" brand automobiles, three-axle cross-country vehicles, and "Red Flag" brand luxury cars; in terms of production capacity, it doubled its original design capacity in one year, which means that under the conditions of "three no increases" (no increase in area, machine tools, and workers), it was equivalent to adding another workshop; in terms of production nature, it changed from a production workshop to a versatile workshop that both produces and trial-manufactures, and both manufactures industrial equipment and simple equipment. People's mental outlook has also changed: their political consciousness has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and the "three-way combination" of leading cadres, workers, and technicians has been implemented in regular production activities. All this is the victory of vigorously launching mass movements and vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution under the leadership of the Party.

    In the process of manufacturing the eight-cylinder engine for the "Red Flag" brand car, under the leadership of the Party General Branch, our workshop used the method of universally mobilizing the masses and organizing specialized "three-way combination" commando teams to solve more than 1,200 large and small process problems, more than 400 product structure problems, and break through 15 complex comprehensive technical key points, some of which were major projects with cutting-edge technology. Because workers and technicians were closely combined under the leadership of the Party, the entire workshop formed a upsurge in which everyone had suggestions, every machine tool had innovations, and everything had demonstrations, and finally overcame numerous difficulties and achieved victory. Facts vividly show that as long as the wisdom of the workers is brought into play, the level of technology will greatly improve; facts also educate technicians that they must follow the mass line in technical work.

    This year is a year of continued leap forward and a year of in-depth development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. This year, our workshop will widely adopt various advanced technologies to further improve the level of mechanization, semi-automation, and automation. To realize these beautiful wishes, we must firmly follow the mass line. In this struggle, our workshop will become a garden for cultivating various process, design, and manufacturing experts. Among the worker comrades, more process engineers and designers will emerge to join the ranks of technical cadres; technical cadres must also continuously transform their thinking and improve their awareness in the torrent of the "three-way combination."

    This new year will also be a year of greater progress in my thinking and technology. I will work with all the technicians and worker comrades in the workshop to actively contribute to the realization of the magnificent plan for 1960.

    “三结合”加速技术革新
    第一汽车制造厂发动机车间技术科科长、工程师  李刚
    沿着党指引的方向，我们在跃进的道路上，送别了1959年，迎来了1960年。过去的一年留下多少不可磨灭的光辉事迹，新的一年又展现了一幅美好的图景。
    1959年，我们第一汽车厂发动机车间，和其他兄弟单位一样，发生了很大的变化：在产品品种方面，由一个专门制造“解放”牌汽车发动机的车间，变为制造“解放”牌汽车、三轴越野汽车、“红旗”牌高级轿车等三种不同型号的发动机的车间；在生产能力方面，一年来比原设计能力提高了一倍，也就是在“三不增加”（不增加面积、机床和工人）的条件下，等于又增加了一个车间；在生产性质方面，由一个生产车间，变为一个既生产又试制，既制造工业装备又制造简易设备的万能车间。人们的精神面貌也有了改变：政治觉悟空前提高，领导干部、工人和技术人员“三结合”，已经贯彻到经常的生产活动当中。这一切，都是在党的领导下，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新和技术革命的胜利。
    在制造“红旗”牌轿车的八缸发动机的过程中，我们车间在党总支的领导下，运用普遍发动群众和组织专业化“三结合”突击队的方法，解决了一千二百多项大小工艺问题，四百多项产品结构问题，突破了十五项复杂的综合性的技术关键，有的还是具有尖端技术水平的重大项目。由于在党的领导下工人和技术人员紧密结合，全车间形成了人人有建议，台台机床有革新，事事有表演的热潮，终于战胜重重困难，取得了胜利。事实生动地说明，只要发挥了工人的智慧，技术水平就会大踏步提高；事实也教育了技术人员，搞技术工作必须走群众路线。
    今年是继续跃进的一年，也是技术革新和技术革命运动深入发展的一年。在今年，我们车间将要广泛采用各种先进工艺，进一步提高机械化、半自动化和自动化水平。要实现这些美好的愿望，必须坚定地走群众路线。在这一斗争中，我们车间将成为培养各类工艺、设计、制造专家的园地。在工人同志们中，将出现更多的工艺师和设计师，参加到技术干部的行列中来；技术干部也要在“三结合”的洪流中，不断改造思想和提高觉悟。
    在这新的一年，对我来说，也将是思想和技术取得更大进步的一年。我将同车间全体技术人员和工人同志一道，为实现1960年的宏伟计划而积极贡献力量。
