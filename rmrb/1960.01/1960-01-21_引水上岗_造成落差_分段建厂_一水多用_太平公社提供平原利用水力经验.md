    Taiping Commune Provides Experience in Utilizing Water Power on the Plains
    (Our dispatch) The Taiping People's Commune in Qingyuan County, Guangdong, has established an industrial zone using water power as its driving force, providing experience for developing industry by utilizing water power in plain areas, and has become a red flag in the comprehensive utilization of water power in the Shaoguan Special Zone.
    The Taiping Commune is located in a plain area, with the Qin Huang River nearby, which has a gentle flow. The south bank is a low-lying area of fields. The Taiping Commune built a dam across the Qin Huang River to raise the water level, and from the south bank of the Qin Huang River to Miaogang, they built a main canal 1,500 meters long, higher than the ground, driving the river water to climb Miaogang. On Miaogang, with the main canal as the center, they dug ten branch canals and connected them with the Miaogang Ditch (the original irrigation canal) at the foot of the western hills, forming a network of canals on the hills. On this network of canals, they installed eighteen wooden water turbines, using water power to drive the water turbines and power thirty-four kinds of mechanical tools for production. Over the past year, the Taiping Commune has successively established an agricultural machinery factory, a fertilizer factory, a gunpowder factory, a paper mill, a bamboo ware factory, a pesticide factory, a pottery factory, a glass factory, a clothing factory, a cement factory, a non-staple food processing factory, and two hydroelectric power stations on Miaogang, making Miaogang an industrial zone for the comprehensive utilization of water energy.
    A year ago, there was not a single factory on Miaogang, and it was covered with pine forests and fruit trees. In the winter of 1958, the commune built indigenous blast furnaces here to vigorously produce iron and steel. In order to save a large amount of labor for operating the bellows, nearly 2,000 people were mobilized and worked hard for five days and nights to divert the water of the Qin Huang River to Miaogang, creating eighteen large wooden water turbines to drive the blowers and smelt iron and steel. In early 1959, according to the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, the Taiping Commune established a comprehensive commune industrial zone on Miaogang.
    The industry of Miaogang has gradually grown stronger by implementing the policy of self-reliance. The first factory established was the agricultural machinery factory. The personnel and equipment of the factory were originally handicraft workers and hand tools from Taiping Town who made ironware, woodwork, basins, buckets, hardware, and other furniture. They used the original water-powered blowers for iron smelting, melt casting, and forging, and established a sand-casting workshop. They not only produced a large number of wooden and iron farm tools to support agriculture, but also manufactured a lot of mechanical equipment for their own factory, enabling the agricultural machinery factory to achieve semi-mechanized production. The wooden and iron mechanical equipment of the bamboo ware factory, pottery factory, paper mill, and other factories that were subsequently established were mostly equipped by the agricultural machinery factory.
    The experience of the Taiping Commune in diverting water uphill to establish an industrial zone for the comprehensive utilization of water energy has broken the superstition that "water must flow rapidly and have a large drop to be utilized." The water of the Qin Huang River and the terrain near Miaogang do not have such conditions. However, the members of the Taiping Commune did not succumb to unfavorable natural conditions and were determined to transform nature. They have gained the following experiences in tapping water power potential and utilizing water energy: First, raise the water level to increase the flow rate. The Qin Huang River originally had a flow rate of only 0.4 cubic meters per second and 26 horsepower. By building a dam across the river, they not only raised the river water to the top of the hill six meters above the ground, but also increased the water flow to 0.8 cubic meters per second, increasing the horsepower to more than 50. Second, build factories in stages and install machines layer by layer, so that the flow rate of only more than 50 horsepower can play a role of 210 horsepower. Third, install various types of water turbines in accordance with local conditions to fully exert the role of flow and velocity. In places with high drops (more than three meters) and small water volumes, double-impact water turbines are used. In flat places with large water volumes and low drops, turbine water turbines are used. In this way, the Miaogang industrial zone can use water power to operate machines regardless of whether it is on high ground, flat ground, or in places with insufficient water sources. Fourth, comprehensive utilization. Not only is water power used to drive machines for production and lighting, but the main canal is also used as a canal to transport industrial raw materials and products. Water is also used from large and small channels to install tap water pipes to supply water to kitchens, bathrooms, breeding farms, and all other places that need water. At the same time, when installing the axles of water turbines, special attention is also paid to using one machine to drive multiple machines and one shaft to drive multiple shafts to maximize the flexibility of the water turbines.
    Now, the experience of utilizing water power in the Miaogang industrial zone has blossomed throughout the commune. A total of 154 water turbines have been installed in the commune, using water power for various productions such as rice milling, crushing materials, and fertilizer production, saving more than 720,000 workdays a year.

### 引水上岗　造成落差　分段建厂　一水多用  太平公社提供平原利用水力经验

    引水上岗　造成落差　分段建厂　一水多用
    太平公社提供平原利用水力经验
    本报讯　广东清远县太平人民公社以水力为动力，建立了一个工业区，为平原地区利用水力发展工业提供了经验，成为韶关专区综合利用水力的一面红旗。
    太平公社地处平原地带，附近有一条秦皇河，流速平缓，南岸是一片较低的田地。太平公社在秦皇河上拦河筑坝，提高水位，并从秦皇河南岸到庙岗止，筑了一条高出于地面的长达一千五百米的大干渠，驱使河水爬上庙岗。在庙岗上，以干渠为中枢，开挖了十条支渠，和西边山岗脚下的庙岗坑（原有的灌溉渠道）联结在一起，在山岗上构成了一个水渠网。就在这水渠网上，装了十八部木制水轮机，利用水力推动水轮机，带动三十四种机械工具进行生产。一年来，太平公社在庙岗上先后建立了农具机械厂、化肥厂、火药厂、造纸厂、竹器厂、农药厂、陶器厂、玻璃厂、被服厂、水泥厂、副食品加工厂和两个水电站，使庙岗成为一个综合利用水能的工业区。
    一年前，庙岗上没有一个工厂，遍地是松林果树。1958年冬季，公社在这里兴建土高炉大炼钢铁，为了节省拉风箱的大量劳动力，出动了近二千人，苦战了五天五夜，把秦皇河水引上庙岗，造了十八部大型木制水轮机，利用水力带动鼓风机炼钢铁。1959年初，太平公社根据上级党委的指示，在庙岗建立综合性的公社工业区。
    庙岗的工业，是贯彻自力更生的方针，逐步壮大起来的。最先建立起来的是农具机械厂。厂里的人员和设备，是原来太平镇里做铁器、木器、盆桶、五金等家具的手工业工人和手工工具。他们利用了原有的水力鼓风机鼓风炼铁、鼓风熔铸、鼓风打铁，并建立了翻砂车间。不但生产了大批木铁农具支援了农业，而且还为自己工厂制造了不少机械设备，使农具机械厂实现了半机械化生产。随后建立的竹器厂、陶器厂、造纸厂等各工厂的木制、铁制的机械设备，绝大部分都是农具机械厂装备的。
    太平公社引水上山，建立综合利用水能工业区的经验，打破了认为“要水流湍急、落差大的水才能利用”的迷信。秦皇河水和庙岗附近的地势，都不具备这样的条件。但是，太平公社的社员不屈服于不利的自然条件，决心改造自然。他们在挖掘水力潜力和利用水能上，获得了如下的几点经验：一、提高水位，增加流量。秦皇河水原来每秒只有零点四流量，二十六马力。他们拦河筑坝，不但将河水面上离地平线六米高的岗顶，而且使水流增加到每秒零点八流量，马力加大到五十多。二、分段建厂、逐层安机，使本来只有五十多马力的流量，起到二百一十马力的作用。三、因地制宜，安装各式水轮机，充分发挥流量、流速的作用。在落差高（三米以上）、水量少的地方，就采用双击式水轮机。在水量多、落差低的平坦地方，便采用涡轮式水轮机。这样，庙岗工业区不论在高地、平地或水源不足的地方，都可以利用水力开动机器。四、综合利用。不但利用水力来带动机器，进行生产、照明，而且还利用大干渠作运河，运输工业原料和产品，利用大小渠道的水装设自来水管，把水供应到厨房、浴室、饲养场等一切需要水的地方。同时，在安装水轮机的轮轴时，还特别注意采用一机带多机、一轴带多轴的办法，以最大限度地发挥水轮机的灵活性。
    现在，庙岗工业区利用水力的经验已在全社开花。全社共安装有一百五十四部水轮机，利用水力进行春米、碎料、制肥等等各种生产，一年可以节省七十二万多个劳动日。（附图片）
