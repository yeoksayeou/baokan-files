Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 17th: 150,000 residents of East and West Berlin held a demonstration and march today to commemorate the 41st anniversary of the murder of German working-class leaders Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg by German reactionaries.

　　Early in the morning, people braved the snow and gathered from all directions, streaming along Stalin Avenue in the Berlin Democratic District towards the Cemetery of Socialist Pioneers, where they laid flowers and paid their respects at the graves of the martyrs.

　　The demonstration began at 9:30 a.m. and lasted for four and a half hours. Walter Ulbricht, Hermann Matern, and other party and government leaders of the German Democratic Republic marched at the head of the procession. People marched forward in a mighty stream, holding high red flags and banners with slogans such as "Socialism will triumph," "Down with militarism," and "Oppose fascist and anti-Semitic activities in West Germany and West Berlin." Among the marchers were victims of fascist persecution using crutches, veteran revolutionaries, and Young Pioneers wearing red scarves. Workers' contingents from West Berlin also carried eye-catching banners demanding "Outlaw fascist forces in West Berlin," "Turn West Berlin into a demilitarized, free city," and "Working class unite!"

　　Before the demonstration, Hermann Matern, a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, delivered a speech at the graves of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. He said that the German Democratic Republic supports the Soviet Union's policy of striving for the relaxation of the international situation and the significant steps it has taken in reducing armed forces.

　　He pointed out that the German Democratic Republic will not relax its struggle to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and to make West Berlin a demilitarized free city. The German Democratic Republic will strive with all its might for the victory of socialism and the realization of the Seven-Year Plan.

　　Matern pointed out that the recent fascist provocations in West Germany and West Berlin were not accidental. Like the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany, the West German militarist reactionaries are preparing for a new war of aggression, ideologically and materially, under the banner of anti-communism. He said that Adenauer's recent visit to West Berlin was to undermine the relaxation of the international situation and to conspire with West Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt to make West Berlin more closely dependent on West Germany's policy of atomic armament.

　　Matern emphasized that West Berlin does not belong to West Germany now, and will never become part of the Federal Republic.

　　He said that in view of the development of the international situation and the dangerous situation in West Germany, now is the time for the two German governments to reach an agreement on the size and location of their military forces and to immediately end West Germany's atomic armament.

　　Today, various activities were also held in many cities of the German Democratic Republic to commemorate the 41st anniversary of the murder of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 18th: The Central Committee of the German Communist Party, on January 16th, issued a statement via "German Freedom Radio 904" regarding the Soviet Union's disarmament decision, calling on Social Democrats, trade unionists, and other peace-loving friends in West Germany to take mass action to force the Adenauer government to stop the West German arms race.

　　The statement pointed out that Adenauer has been pursuing a "policy of strength," opposing the relaxation of international tensions, and opposing mutual understanding with the German Democratic Republic for ten years. This policy is now more desperate and dangerous than ever. The Soviet Union is able to defeat any West German aggression, and therefore any attempt to launch an aggression is tantamount to suicide. However, like Hitler, Adenauer is determined to continue pursuing the current policy of strength until he is destroyed by it.

　　The statement emphasized that now is the time for West German workers and other peace-loving people to take firm action to safeguard the future of peace and security. (Attached photo)

    打倒西德军国主义反对法西斯反犹活动
    柏林十五万居民举行大示威
    德共中央号召人民起来迫使阿登纳政府停止扩军
    新华社柏林17日电　东、西柏林十五万居民今天举行示威游行，纪念德国工人阶级领袖李卜克内西和卢森堡被德国反动派杀害四十一周年。
    一大早，人们就踏着积雪从四面八方集合起来，沿着柏林民主区的斯大林大街涌向社会主义先驱者公墓，在先烈的墓前献花致敬。
    示威游行从上午九时半开始，共历时四小时三十分钟。格罗提渥、马特恩以及德意志民主共和国其他党政领导人走在游行队伍的最前列。人们高举红旗和写着“社会主义胜利”、“打倒军国主义”和“反对西德和西柏林的法西斯反犹活动”等口号的标语牌浩浩荡荡地前进。游行队伍中有架着拐杖的受法西斯迫害的人，有老革命家，也有系着蓝领巾的少先队员。西柏林的工人队伍也举着醒目的标语牌，他们要求“取缔西柏林的法西斯势力”，“把西柏林变为一个非军事化的自由城市”，“工人阶级行动一致”。
    示威游行开始以前，德国统一社会党中央政治局委员马特恩在李卜克内西和卢森堡的墓前发表了演说。他说，德意志民主共和国支持苏联争取国际局势缓和的政策和在裁减武装部队方面所采取的有重大意义的步骤。
    他指出，德意志民主共和国不会放松争取签订对德和约和使西柏林成为非军事化的自由城市的斗争。德意志民主共和国要以全部力量来争取社会主义的胜利，实现七年计划。
    马特恩指出，最近在西德和西柏林发生的法西斯挑衅活动不是偶然的。正像魏玛共和国和纳粹德国一样，西德的军国主义反动派正在反共的旗帜下，从思想和物质各方面进行新的侵略战争的准备。他说，不久前阿登纳到西柏林去，是为了破坏国际局势的缓和，为了同西柏林市长勃兰特密谋使西柏林更紧地依附于西德的原子武装的政策。
    马特恩强调说，西柏林现在不属于西德，而且将来也不会成为联邦共和国的一部分。
    他说，鉴于国际局势的发展和西德的危险形势，现在是两个德国政府就军事力量的规模和驻地取得协议并立即结束西德的原子武装的时候了。
    今天，德意志民主共和国许多城市也举行了各种活动，纪念李卜克内西和卢森堡遇害四十一周年。
    新华社柏林18日电　德国共产党中央委员会16日通过“德国九○四自由广播电台”就苏联的裁军决定发表一项声明，呼吁社会民主党人、工会工作者和西德其他爱好和平的朋友采取群众性的行动来迫使阿登纳政府停止西德的军备竞赛。
    声明指出，阿登纳奉行“实力地位政策”、反对缓和国际紧张局势和反对同德意志民主共和国相互谅解，已经十年了。目前这种政策比以往任何时候都更加绝望和危险。苏联能够击败西德的任何侵略，因而任何发动侵略的尝试都等于自杀。但是，像希特勒一样，阿登纳执意继续奉行目前的实力政策，直到为这种政策所毁灭。
    声明强调指出，现在已经是西德工人和其他和平人士坚定不移地采取行动来保障和平与安全的前途的时候了。（附图片）
