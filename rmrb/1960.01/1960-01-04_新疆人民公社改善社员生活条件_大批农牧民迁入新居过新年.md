Xinjiang People's Communes Improve Living Conditions for Members
Large Numbers of Farmers and Herdsmen Move into New Homes for the New Year

Urumqi, January 3rd (This newspaper) – Recently, more than 13,000 households of various ethnic farmers and herdsmen in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have happily moved into new homes one after another. This is a significant manifestation of the great development of production and the large increase in income for members of the people's communes in rural and pastoral areas of Xinjiang.

In the rural areas where the Uygur people live in Xinjiang, the communes have built more than 3,000 new houses for members with poor living conditions. These houses are generally built by production teams in central areas with beautiful environments and convenient for production. The rooms are spacious, well-lit, and meet sanitary conditions. In the Ninth Management District of Seman Commune in Kashgar City, on the banks of the Kashgar River in southern Xinjiang, 113 out of 623 members' households have moved into new houses with floors and glass windows. Poor peasant member Sawuti Wushou's family of three has new bedding and cotton clothes, and new boots. After one year of communization, the whole family's clothing has been completely changed. In the newly built residential villages of Xiaerwake Management District of Fenghuo Commune in Hotan County and Xinleyuan Management District of Xinsheng Commune in Yutian County, each member's household generally has one or two bedrooms, a living room, and a storage room and bathroom. The style of the houses has Uygur characteristics, and the windows are fitted with glass. In front of the house is an open space that serves as a garden and orchard, and behind the house is a vegetable garden. The ninety-two rooms that have already been built are equipped with electric lights.

The vast pastoral areas are even more lively. In the sparsely populated Altai Mountains, Tianshan Pastures, and Balikun Grassland, 157 new settlements for herdsmen have emerged. More than 11,700 households of herdsmen have moved into new homes. These new settlements are equipped with schools, shops, medical institutions, nurseries, and kindergartens, and some have also built clubs. In the Altai area, 30 people's communes built and expanded about 150 new settlements in 1959, and about 10,000 households of Kazakh, Mongolian, and other ethnic herdsmen moved into new homes. In addition, 23 people's communes have built clubs that can accommodate about 500 people. The Pioneer People's Commune in Balikun Kazakh Autonomous County built six settlements on the grassland and built more than 200 new houses, including a bank, a cooperative, a clinic, and a Kazakh middle school, enabling more than 1,000 herdsmen's households to settle down completely. In previous years, the time around the New Year was the coldest season on the grassland, and the tents were chilling. This year, the herdsmen moved into warm and comfortable new homes, ate in public canteens, bought things in shops, and their children went to nurseries or schools. A joyous atmosphere has emerged on the grassland.

    新疆人民公社改善社员生活条件
    大批农牧民迁入新居过新年
    本报乌鲁木齐3日电　最近，新疆维吾尔自治区有一万三千多户各民族农牧民欢欢喜喜地陆续迁入新居。这是新疆农村和牧区各人民公社生产大发展，社员收入大增加的显著表现。
    在新疆维吾尔族聚居的农村中，公社为居住条件较差的社员修建了新房三千多幢。这些房屋一般都以生产队为单位，建筑在环境幽美、便于生产的中心地带。房内宽敞、光线充足，合乎卫生条件。在南疆喀什噶尔河畔的喀什市色满公社第九管理区，六百二十三户社员中就有一百一十三户住上了有地板和玻璃窗户的新房。贫农社员沙吾提吾守一家三口人，被褥、棉衣都是新缝的，靴子也都是新买的。公社化一年，他们全家的穿着都换了一个样。在和田县烽火公社肖尔瓦克管理区和于田县新声公社新乐园管理区新建的居民新村，每户社员一般都有一间或两间寝室、一间客厅、一间储藏室兼洗澡间。房屋的式样具有维吾尔族的特点，窗户都装有玻璃。屋前一块空地是花园兼果园，屋后留有菜地。已经建成的九十二间，都装上了电灯。
    广大牧区更是一片热闹景象。在原来人烟稀少的阿尔泰山区、天山牧场和巴里坤草原上，出现了一百五十七个牧民定居新村。迁入新居的牧民有一万一千七百多户。这批定居新村都设有学校、商店、医疗机构、托儿所、幼儿园，有些还修建了俱乐部。阿勒泰专区三十个人民公社，1959年新建和扩建的定居新村就有一百五十个左右，约一万户哈萨克、蒙古等族牧民住上了新房，并且还有二十三个人民公社修建起了能够容纳五百人左右的俱乐部。巴里坤哈萨克族自治县先锋人民公社在草原上修了六个定居点，新建了二百多幢住宅，包括有银行、合作社、诊疗所和一所哈萨克中学，使一千多户牧民全部定居下来。往年新年前后正是草原上最冷的季节，帐篷内寒气逼人；今年，牧民们搬进温暖舒适的新房，吃饭有公共食堂，买东西有商店，子女进托儿所或上学校念书，草原上出现一片欢乐气氛。
