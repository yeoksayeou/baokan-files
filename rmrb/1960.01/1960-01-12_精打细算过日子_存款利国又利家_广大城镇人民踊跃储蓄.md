    Living Frugally: Saving Benefits the Country and the Family
    Broad Masses of Urban People Actively Save

    (Reported by this newspaper) Since the fourth quarter of last year, savings deposits of urban people across the country have increased again. According to statistics from the People's Bank of China, at the end of the fourth quarter of last year, the balance of urban savings deposits nationwide increased by 560 million yuan compared with the end of the third quarter, while the end of the third quarter increased by 390 million yuan compared with the end of the second quarter. Among them, the proportion of fixed deposits increased even faster. For example, in Jiangsu Province, the proportion of fixed deposits rose from 50% last year to 70%.

    Under the call of the "Resolution on Launching the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement" of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, cadres, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and street residents to participate in savings has become even higher. Many government cadres and residents in Nanning City, Guangxi, have formulated plans to participate in fixed savings on a monthly basis. The city's savings in October was equivalent to 140% of the total increase in the third quarter. In Heilongjiang Province, workers who regularly participate in savings account for more than 80% of the total number of urban workers, and the average deposit per worker in the province exceeds 100 yuan. More than 90% of the workers in the Xinxi North-West Printing and Dyeing Factory in Xi'an participate in savings. The Party Committee of the Tianjin Livestock Company's Leather and Fur Processing Factory, in accordance with the spirit of grasping production on the one hand and life on the other, educated all the factory's workers to be diligent and thrifty, to save and economize, and to have reserves. The workers planned their lives and made savings plans. The current savings deposits have increased more than four times compared to July of this year.

    Among urban residents, many frugal housekeepers and models of active savings have emerged. Gong Shuxian, a family member of a Beijing Daily employee living in Xibiaobei Hutong, Dongcheng District, Beijing, does not have a large family income, but because she plans her life carefully, she has money to deposit in the bank every month. Under her influence, more than 20 households in the same courtyard have participated in savings. Wang Yunxiu, an outstanding street cadre from Group 4, Shiren Street, Xihu District, Benxi City, arranges her life in an orderly manner every month and has persisted in saving for five consecutive years. From the facts of the past few years, she deeply understands that participating in savings is beneficial to the country and to herself. She often tells her neighbors: to make life better and better, we must carefully plan our lives, live frugally and thriftily, and participate in more savings to avoid waste.

    精打细算过日子　存款利国又利家
    广大城镇人民踊跃储蓄
    本报讯　去年第四季度以来，全国城镇人民储蓄存款又有增加。据中国人民银行统计，去年第四季度末，全国城镇储蓄存款余额比第三季度末增加五点六亿元，而第三季度末比第二季度末增加了三点九亿元。其中，定期储蓄的比重增加更快。如江苏省定期存款比重由去年的50％上升到70％。
    在党的八届八中全会“关于开展增产节约运动的决议”号召下，广大职工、干部、解放军官兵和街道居民参加储蓄的热情更加高涨。广西南宁市许多机关干部和居民，制定分月参加定期储蓄的计划，全市10月份的储蓄额，相当于第三季度增长总额的140％。黑龙江省经常参加储蓄的职工，已占城镇职工总数的80％以上，全省职工每人平均存款一百元以上。西安新西北印染厂有90％以上的职工参加了储蓄。天津畜产公司皮毛加工厂党委，根据一手抓生产、一手抓生活的精神，教育全厂职工克勤克俭，省吃俭用，留有后备；工人们有计划地安排生活，订立节约储蓄计划，现在的储蓄存款比今年7月份增加四倍以上。
    城市居民中，出现了不少勤俭持家的能手和积极储蓄的模范。住在北京东城区西裱背胡同的北京日报职工家属龚淑贤，一家收入虽然不多，但是由于她有计划地安排生活，每月都有钱存入银行。在她的带动下，同院二十多户都参加了储蓄。本溪市溪湖区仕仁街四组的优秀街道干部王云秀老大娘，月月生活都安排得有条有理，连续五年坚持储蓄。从几年来的事实中，她深刻体会到参加储蓄对国家对自己都有好处，常和邻居们说：要生活越过越好，就要精打细算安排生活，勤俭节约地过日子，多参加储蓄，避免浪费。（附图片）
