    Indigenous Derrick Shows Great Power
    "The indigenous derrick has great power, mechanizing manual labor. With it, the loading and unloading workers grin from ear to ear with a flick of the gate..." Walking into the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant's train loading and unloading section, one sees big-character posters, red and green, singing the praises of mechanization. On the worksite, the indigenous derrick is gliding like an eagle, lifting large steel billets from the carriages. Xu Wenxiang, a loading and unloading worker standing in the carriage, sends the steel billets one by one into the "mouth" of the iron clamps. As soon as they are in place, Sun Zhanshan, a loading and unloading worker guarding the winch, flips the gate and says "Up!" Following the stirring of the steel cable, the steel billet, weighing about a ton each, is obediently lifted out.

    The indigenous derrick was born in early December. This section used to have only three cranes. Due to the large workload, they were often unable to be scheduled effectively, especially when it came to unloading steel billets, the workers were even busier. Each steel billet weighs about a ton, and there are thirty or so in a car. Sometimes there would be forty or fifty cars, and three cranes could not unload them all day and night. With no other choice, the workers used large ropes to pull them down one by one. Unloading a car would take seven or eight hours, leaving them covered in sweat and prone to accidents. Once mechanization was initiated, the veteran workers and technicians of this section formed a "breakthrough team". They huddled together day and night to come up with ideas, using two wooden poles and steel cables, pulleys, etc. to trial-produce a hand-cranked derrick. This still required manpower. They heard that the factory had idle winches, so they further modified it into an automatic derrick driven by a winch.

    This indigenous derrick costs very little money, uses few materials, and increases efficiency more than nine times compared to manual loading and unloading. Now, this section has installed five of them.

### 土造扒杆大显威风

    丢下老牛跨骏马
    土造扒杆大显威风
    “土造扒杆威力大，体力劳动机械化，装卸工人有了它，一扳闸门笑哈哈。”……走进天津第一钢厂火车装卸工段的大门，就看见一张张歌颂机械化的红红绿绿的大字报。工地上，土造扒杆正像老鹰一样滑动着从车厢里往外拎着大块钢坯。站在车厢里的装卸工人许文祥把一根根钢坯送到铁夹子的“嘴”里，刚安好，守在卷扬机旁边的装卸工人孙占山一扳闸门，说声“起！”顺着钢丝绳的搅动，一吨左右一根的钢坯乖乖地拎出来了。
    土造扒杆是在12月上旬才诞生的。这个工段过去只有三个吊车，由于任务大，经常调度不开，尤其遇到卸钢坯的活，工人们就更忙。每根钢坯都有一吨左右，一车有三十来根，有时一来就是四、五十车，三个吊车昼夜也卸不完。没办法，工人们就用大绳一根一根地往下拉，卸一车要用七、八个小时，累得满身大汗，还容易出事故。一搞机械化，这个工段的老工人和技术人员组成了“破关队”，白天黑夜地凑在一起出主意，用二根木杆子和钢丝绳、滑轮等试制成一个手摇的扒杆。这还是费人力，他们听说厂里有闲着的卷扬机，就又进一步改装成由卷扬机带动的自动扒杆。
    这种土造扒杆花钱很少，用料不多，比人工装卸提高效率九倍以上。现在，这个工段已经安装了五架。
