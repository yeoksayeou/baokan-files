Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: In recent days, the capital has been filled with a festive atmosphere. All the stores are filled with customers, and sales have increased significantly. The largest Wangfujing Children's Goods Store saw its turnover increase by more than 50% compared to weekdays.

More than 180,000 employees in the capital's commercial and service industries are actively working to ensure the supply of festival goods and services so that all the people of the city can happily celebrate the Spring Festival. Commercial departments began actively organizing sources of goods as early as before the New Year. The number of commodities in the Wangfujing Department Store increased from 35,000 before the New Year to more than 39,000. In the past week, commercial employees have been fighting day and night to transfer and package goods. Many stores have also organized manpower to deliver goods to homes, which has been welcomed by residents.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 26th: Commercial departments in various parts of Heilongjiang Province have strengthened the supply of goods and services before the Spring Festival.

Eight industrial cities, including Harbin, Qiqihar, Yichun, and Jixi, began supplying festive goods on January 15. Supply stations have been set up on every street in Harbin, and residents can purchase non-staple foods such as meat, fish, vegetables, vermicelli, and seafood at any time. Female service personnel at street service stations push handcarts to deliver non-staple foods to the homes of military families, dependents of martyrs, the elderly, the weak, and residents where both husband and wife are working. In the coal mining city of Jixi, forty-four round-the-clock stores have been added to supply non-staple foods for the Spring Festival.

Festival supplies with rich ethnic flavors were shipped to rural areas as early as around the New Year, including red paper, red candles, and children's toys.
