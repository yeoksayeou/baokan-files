Xinhua News Agency, Moscow – Livestock producers across the Soviet Union are raising their production targets, aiming to complete two, three, or even four annual meat production plans in a single year and significantly increase the output of other livestock products.

The prospects for significantly exceeding annual livestock product production plans this year, especially for meat, are very promising. Since the conclusion of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's December Plenum, party representative conferences and activist meetings held in various republics, states, and regions have been studying the experience of Ryazan Oblast in significantly increasing meat production and improving the output of other livestock products in 1959, and are confidently striving to emulate Ryazan Oblast. The advanced are continuing to move forward, and the backward are catching up, and a livestock production competition movement centered on a sharp increase in meat production has taken shape nationwide.

Ryazan Oblast, which ranked first in meat production in 1959, has decided to deliver 200,000 tons of meat to the state this year, which is nearly equivalent to completing four annual plans. To achieve this, it plans to raise and deliver 1.1 million pigs, 241,500 head of large livestock, 263,000 sheep, and 3.6 million poultry to the state this year. Tula and Kostroma Oblasts plan to complete three annual meat production plans in one year. Chechen-Ingush, Bashkir, and Tatar Autonomous Republics, as well as Moscow, Perm, Ulyanovsk, Orenburg, and Vinnytsia Oblasts, have decided to complete two annual plans in one year. Some districts and collective farms plan to complete four or even five annual meat production plans in one year. The production of other livestock products, such as milk, eggs, and wool, will also be greatly increased. Stanislav, Ternopol, Volyn, and Chernivtsi Oblasts, which originally proposed to complete the livestock product production tasks stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan in five years, are now proposing to complete this task in four years. Some republics and regions have also decided to complete the livestock product production tasks stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan in five or four years, respectively. The production increase targets that have emerged this year are unprecedented, and this is a resounding response from the working people to the Party's call to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita livestock products.

In terms of rapidly increasing meat production, all localities are paying attention to vigorously developing the hog raising industry. Hog raising experts who have emerged in various localities have put forward new guarantees this year and launched competitions to strive to make new contributions to the overfulfillment of the Seven-Year Plan. Perekhrestivko, a hog raising girl at the "Vanquisher" State Farm in the Kormilov District of Omsk Oblast, decided to raise 2,200 pigs this year (compared to 2,076 last year) and issued a challenge, calling on hog raisers to strive to raise 1,000 to 1,500 pigs per person. Her call was quickly echoed. Belova, a famous hog raiser at the "Bolshevik" State Farm in Kalinin Oblast, decided to raise 2,800 pigs this year (compared to 1,500 last year), and Bartulis, a hog raiser at the "Katenieki" State Farm in Latvia, decided to raise and deliver 3,000 pigs to the state, which is 1,000 more than last year.

To support large-scale livestock production and ensure the realization of this year's production increase targets, members of the Communist Youth League and young people in some cities have come to the livestock production front. For example, 10,000 urban youth from the Bashkir Autonomous Republic have already arrived at the forefront of livestock production - cowsheds and livestock pens, and another 9,000 members of the Communist Youth League are ready to go. In Belgorod Oblast, almost all young people, except for young machine operators and those participating in construction work, have expressed their willingness to actively respond to the Party's call to participate in livestock production.

    梁赞州继续前进  各地区奋起直追
    苏联畜牧业生产者竞赛热烈
    为了迅速增产肉类大力发展养猪事业
    新华社莫斯科电　苏联全国各地的畜牧业生产者正纷纷提高生产指标，要一年完成两个、三个甚至四个年度计划的肉类生产任务并大大提高其它畜产品产量。
    今年大大超额完成年度畜产品生产计划、特别是肉类生产任务的前景非常美好。从苏联共产党中央委员会十二月全会闭幕后，在各加盟共和国、州、边疆区举行的党代表会议和积极分子会议上，大家都在学习梁赞州1959年大大增产肉类和提高其它畜产品产量的经验，并满怀信心地要向梁赞州看齐。先进者继续前进，后进者奋起直追，一个继续以猛增肉类为中心的畜牧业生产竞赛运动已在全国范围内形成。
    1959年在增产肉类方面首屈一指的梁赞州，今年决定交给国家二十万吨肉类，即将近完成四个年度的计划。为此今年要养成并上交给国家一百一十万头猪、二十四万一千五百头大家畜、二十六万三千只羊、三百六十万只家禽。图拉、科斯特罗马等州今年一年要完成三个年度的肉类生产计划。车臣印古希、巴什基尔、鞑靼等自治共和国和莫斯科、别尔姆、乌里扬诺夫斯克、奥伦堡、文尼策等州都决定今年一年完成两个年度计划。有些区和集体农庄今年一年要完成四个甚至五个年度肉类生产计划。其它畜产品的生产，如奶类、蛋类、羊毛等也将大大提高。原来提出要五年完成七年计划规定的畜产品生产任务的斯坦尼斯拉夫、特尔诺波尔、沃林、契尔诺维奇等州，现在都提出要四年完成这一任务。一些共和国和边疆区也分别决定提前在五年或四年完成七年计划规定的畜产品生产任务。今年出现的增产指标是前所未有的，这是劳动人民对党提出的要在畜产品按人口平均计算上赶上美国的号召的响亮回答。
    在迅速增产肉类方面，各地都注意大力发展养猪事业。各地涌现的养猪能手，今年又提出了新的保证，并发起竞赛，争取为超额完成七年计划作出新的贡献。鄂木斯克州科尔米洛夫区“胜利者”国营农场养猪姑娘佩列希芙科，决定今年喂养成二千二百头猪（去年为二千零七十六头），并以此提出挑战，号召养猪员争取每人养一千到一千五百头猪。她的号召很快得到了响应。加里宁州“布尔什维克”国营农场著名养猪员别洛娃决定今年养二千八百头猪（去年养一千五百头），拉脱维亚“卡捷涅基”国营农场养猪员巴尔图利斯，决定养成交给国家三千头，比去年多一千来头。
    为支援畜牧业大生产，以保证实现今年的增产指标，有的城市的共青团员和青年纷纷来到畜牧业生产战线。例如，巴什基尔自治共和国的一万名城市青年已经到了畜牧业生产最前线——牛棚和畜舍，还有九千名共青团员整装待发，在别尔哥罗德州，除青年机器操纵手和参加建设工作的青年以外，其余青年几乎都表示要积极响应党的号召，去参加畜牧业生产。（附图片）
