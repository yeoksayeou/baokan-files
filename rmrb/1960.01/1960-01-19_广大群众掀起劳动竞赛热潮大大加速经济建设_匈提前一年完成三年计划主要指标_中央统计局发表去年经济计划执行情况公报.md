Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 17th: According to reports in the local press on the 17th, the Hungarian Central Bureau of Statistics issued a communiqué on the execution of the national economic plan for 1959. The communiqué stated that Hungary had already reached the original 1960 level of the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) in important economic indicators one year ahead of schedule in 1959. This is the result of the broad masses responding to the call of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party's March Central Committee Plenum, universally launching a labor emulation drive to welcome the Party Congress, thereby greatly accelerating the speed of economic construction.

The communiqué pointed out that the total output value of socialist industry in 1959 increased by 11% compared with 1958. State-owned industries overfulfilled the production plan by 7%. Production in the heavy industry sector in 1959 increased by 16% compared with 1958, while light industry and the food industry increased by 7%. The production departments of basic raw materials have been rapidly developed. The production of the chemical industry and building materials industry increased by 18%-19%, and the machine industry increased by 16%. Coal production in 1959 reached 25.3 million tons, electricity - 7.1 billion kilowatt-hours, steel - 1.759 million tons, and steel materials - 1.139 million tons.

In one year, the number of employees increased by 67,400. Labor productivity has increased rapidly since the March resolution of the Party Central Committee Plenum. State-owned industries also overfulfilled their tasks in reducing production costs.

The communiqué pointed out that investment in capital construction in 1959 increased by 20% compared with 1958.

Great achievements have been made in the socialist transformation of agriculture: As of December 31, 1959, the cultivated area of state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives accounted for 55.8% of the country's total cultivated area, while at the end of 1958 it accounted for only 29.5%. The number of cooperative members nationwide reached 584,000, which is equivalent to three and a half times that of the end of 1958.

Agricultural production also overfulfilled the plan. The grain harvest was very good. The average yield of wheat per "hold" in 1959 increased by 9% compared with the bumper year of 1957, and 36% compared with 1958.

The number of tractors put into agricultural production in 1959 increased threefold compared with 1958, combine harvesters increased sevenfold, seeders increased twofold, and forage harvesters increased sixfold. The amount of chemical fertilizers used in agriculture increased by 61% compared with 1958.

Animal husbandry has also developed.

In terms of transportation, freight volume in 1959 increased by 15% compared with 1958, and passenger volume increased by 9%.

The communiqué stated that in terms of foreign trade, imports in 1959 increased by 23% compared with 1958, and exports increased by 12%.

The people's living standards also improved in 1959. (Attached pictures)
