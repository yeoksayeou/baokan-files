    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, January 6th: With the help of her workshop director and technicians, Ma Lizhen, a female lathe operator at the Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, successfully tested a semi-automatic “Meteor” thread rolling machine on New Year's Day. The production efficiency increased by 359 times compared to the original, completing the workload of one year and one month in a single day.
    The “Meteor” thread rolling technique was an advanced experience that Ma Lizhen learned from Wang Bingxiang, a lathe operator at the Shanghai Xingzhong Electrical Machinery Factory, during the National Congress of Heroes. After returning to the factory from Beijing, she began experimenting, but failed several times. After the conclusion of the Jinan Municipal Congress of Heroes in the fields of industry, transportation, infrastructure, finance, and trade, Ma Lizhen, determined to complete a year's worth of work in two days, vowed to successfully test the "Meteor" thread rolling machine. She and the workshop director and technicians analyzed the causes of previous failures, made a series of improvements, and finally succeeded at 0:20 on New Year's Day, increasing the processing of screws from 40 per hour to 10,800.
    When Ma Lizhen successfully trial-produced the "Meteor" thread rolling machine, the cheers, laughter, and the sound of gongs and drums filled the entire workshop. However, she was not satisfied with the achievements already made. Since New Year's Day, Ma Lizhen has continued to work diligently, humbly learning from others, and constantly improving the "Meteor" thread rolling machine, increasing the efficiency of screw production to 14,400 per hour, enabling her to do more than a year and a month's work in a day. She is now further improving the machine, preparing to fully automate it.
  Xinhua News Agency, Dalian-Lushun, January 6th: Zhang Zhibang, a Dalian-Lushun special-class labor model and a young technician from the Dalian Crane Factory who started as a worker, broke down superstitions, liberated his thinking, and skillfully used the principle of "cold shrinking and thermal expansion" to solve a major quality problem in crane production – the deformation of single-web girder bridge cranes. This method not only saved labor and materials, increasing production efficiency thirty-two times, but also eliminated heavy physical labor.
    The crane's girder is the backbone of a crane. Because the girder structure is too long, the girder would deform after welding, and it had to be straightened again. Zhang Zhibang had previously put in a lot of effort to address the deformation problem. In the midst of the vigorous technical performance competition, he further studied the characteristics of the crane girder and the causes of deformation. With the help of technician Chang Youmin and worker Ge Wenming, after seven days and nights of research, he finally found a solution based on the principle of cold shrinking and thermal expansion. Before welding the crane girder, he first bent the steel plate according to the amount of deformation after welding. After high-temperature welding, the bent steel plate would return to its original shape after cooling, eliminating the need for gas heating and hammer knocking.
    This method not only fundamentally ensures the quality of the crane, but also greatly reduces the labor intensity of workers and saves manpower and material resources. Calculating the manufacture of a 36-ton lid-lifting crane, this can save 31 laborers, 9 bottles of oxygen, and 270 kilograms of calcium carbide, increasing efficiency thirty-two times.

    革新胆略包天　跃进步伐如飞
    马丽珍一天干完十三个月的活
    张智邦巧治“吊车变形”工效提高三十二倍
    新华社济南6日电　济南第一机床厂女车工马丽珍在工段长和技术员的帮助下，元旦试验成功半自动化流星滚丝机，生产效率比原来提高三百五十九倍，一天完成了一年零一个多月的工作量。
    流星滚丝是马丽珍在全国群英会上向上海兴中电机工厂车工王秉祥学习到的先进经验。她从北京回厂以后就动手试验，可是一连几次都没有成功。在济南市工业、交通、基建、财贸方面群英会闭幕以后，马丽珍为了实现两天完成一年的工作量的决心，立志非把流星滚丝机试验成功不可。她同工段长、技术员共同分析，找出了前几次失败的原因，作了一系列的改进，终于在元旦零时二十分试验成功，加工螺丝由每小时四十个提高到一万零八百个。
    马丽珍试制成功流星滚丝机时，全车间祝捷的掌声、欢笑声、锣鼓声响成一片。但是，她并不满足于已有成绩。元旦以来，马丽珍继续刻苦钻研，虚心向别人请教，不断改进流星滚丝机，使生产螺丝的效率每小时又增加到一万四千四百个，一天能干一年零一个多月的活。现在她正进一步改进，准备使流星滚丝机完全自动化。
  据新华社旅大6日电　旅大市特等劳动模范、大连起重机厂工人出身的青年技术员张智邦，破除迷信，解放思想，巧用“冷缩热胀”原理，解决了起重机生产的重大质量问题——单腹板结构桥式吊车大梁变形问题，既省工又省料，使生产效率提高三十二倍，还消除了笨重的体力劳动。
    吊车的大梁骨是一台吊车上的主干。由于大梁结构太长，等到焊接好了，大梁就变了形，还得重新来直弯。张智邦过去就在变形问题上下过苦工。在轰轰烈烈的技术表演赛中，他进一步研究了吊车大梁的特点和产生变形的原因，在技术员常佑民和工人葛文明的帮助下，经过七昼夜的研究，终于找到了根据冷缩热胀的原理，在焊接吊车大梁之前，就根据焊接后变形的幅度，先把钢板顶上弯。带弯的钢板经过高温焊接，冷却后便可恢复原状，再不需要用瓦斯烤、大锤敲了。
    这个方法不仅从根本上保证了吊车的质量，而且大大减轻了工人的劳动强度，节约了人力物力。以制造一台三十六吨揭盖吊车计算，就可以节约三十一个劳动力，九瓶氧气和二百七十公斤电石。提高效率三十二倍。（附图片）
