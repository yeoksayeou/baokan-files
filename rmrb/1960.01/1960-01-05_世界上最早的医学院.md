The world's earliest medical school was the "Taiyi Shu" (Imperial Medical Department) of the Tang Dynasty in China. It was at least two hundred years earlier than the earliest European medical school, the Salerno Medical School in Italy.

According to the "Tang Liu Dian" (Six Codes of the Tang Dynasty), we can know that the "Taiyi Shu" of the Tang Dynasty was not only large in scale and well-equipped, but also had very clear training goals and scientific training methods. It was divided into four departments (equivalent to the current departments), namely: Physicians, Acupuncturists, Masseurs, and Exorcists. In each department, a professor was responsible for teaching. Students who studied for a certain period would take an exam, and those with excellent exam results would be approved as qualified doctors.

Among the four departments, the Physician department had the widest scope. Students entering this department first had to study the common required courses "Ben Cao" (Materia Medica) and "Jia Yi Mai Jing" (Classic of Pulse Diagnosis), and then study five specialized courses respectively, namely: 1. Body Therapy (Internal Medicine), 2. Sores and Swelling (Surgery), 3. Shao Xiao (Pediatrics), 4. Ears, Eyes, Mouth, and Teeth, and 5. Jiao Fa (a method of treating diseases by burning moxa).

The second was the Acupuncturist department. Students in this department first learned the location of meridians and acupoints, and then learned to identify the symptoms of various diseases and the techniques of acupuncture treatment. At that time, acupuncturists commonly used nine types of needles, which could treat the excess (stagnation) or deficiency (loss) of the five internal organs using tonifying and reducing methods.

The third was the Masseur department. Students in this department learned the methods of "xiaoxi daoyin" (massage and guiding) (that is, a treatment method that uses massage to activate the meridians and collaterals to eliminate diseases). It is said that massage can treat eight types of diseases, namely: 1. Wind (rheumatism), 2. Cold (catching cold), 3. Summer Heat (heatstroke), 4. Dampness (arthritis), 5. Hunger (gastrointestinal diseases), 6. Collapse (fainting), 7. Labor (overwork), 8. Ease (possibly laziness or indigestion). The theory of massage believes that diseases occur when the limbs, joints, and internal organs are stagnant. Massage is used to activate the meridians and collaterals to guide away the stagnation and eliminate the disease.

In the Exorcist department, students learned the methods of using incantations to exorcise evil spirits. This can only be regarded as superstition and not real medicine.

In addition to the above four medical departments, the "Taiyi Shu" also had a pharmacy department. The pharmacy department had herb collectors, medicinal garden students, and medicinal garden masters, which was a department dedicated to training pharmaceutical talents.

From the establishment of the "Taiyi Shu" in the Tang Dynasty and the scale and well-equipped nature of the "Taiyi Shu", we can know that ancient Chinese medicine was at the forefront of the world. Today, our country has a population of over 600 million, which is closely related to our rich medical and scientific heritage.

    世界上最早的医学院
    朱仲玉
    世界上最早的医学院是我国唐朝时候的“太医署”，它比欧洲最早的医科学校意大利萨勒诺医科学校至少要早二百多年。
    根据“唐六典”的记载，我们可以知道唐朝的“太医署”不仅规模宏大设备周全，并且它的培养目标十分明确，培养方法也很科学。它里面分为四个部门（相当于现在的系），即：医师、针师、按摩师和咒禁师。在每一个部门里都由博士担任教学工作。学生学习到一定时期就举行考试，考试成绩优良的被批准为合格的医生。
    四个部门中医师这个部门范围最广。进入这个部门学习的学生，先要学习共同必修的课程“本草”和“甲乙脉经”，然后再分别学习五个专门化的课程，即：一、体疗（内科），二、疮肿（外科），三、少小（小儿科），四、耳目口齿，五、角法（以艾火烧灸治病之法）。
    其次是针师，在这个部门学习的学生，先学习经脉孔穴的部位，再学习识别各种疾病的症候及用针法治疗的技术。当时针医常用的针有九种，能以补泻法治疗五脏的有余（积滞）或不足（亏损）之症。
    再次是按摩师，学生在这个部门学习的是消息导引之法（即以按摩活络经脉使病消失的治疗方法）。据说按摩能够治疗八种疾病，即：一、风（风湿），二、寒（受寒），三、暑（中暑），四、湿（关节病），五、饥（肠胃病），六、绝（昏晕），七、劳（劳累过度），八、逸（可能是懒病或积食一类的病）。按摩的理论认为，凡是人的四肢关节和腑脏有所郁积时就会得病，按摩就是用活络经脉之法把郁积给导引走，使疾病消失。
    在咒禁师这个部门学习的是以咒禁祓除邪魅之法，这只能算是迷信，不能算是真正的医学。
    “太医署”里面除掉上述四个医疗部门外，还设有药科。药科内部设有采药师、药园生、药园师等，是一个专事培养药学人才的部门。
    从唐朝时设置“太医署”以及“太医署”的规模宏大设备周全这些方面来看，可以知道我国古代的医药科学是走在世界最前列的。今天我们的国家拥有六亿多人口，是与我国丰富的医药科学遗产有着密切关系的。
