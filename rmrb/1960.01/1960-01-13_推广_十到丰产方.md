Promote the "Ten-To-Fertility Plot"

The Hebei Daily published an editorial on January 11th entitled "Promote the 'Ten-To Plot'," requiring all regions to actively manage wheat fields and strive for a bumper wheat harvest this year. The abstract is as follows:

In order to achieve continuous advancement in agricultural production in 1960, Tang County is learning from An Guo County's approach of launching a wheat yield surpassing competition, vigorously grasping wheat high yield, and universally promoting the "Ten-To Plot" management measures, which has greatly deepened the wheat yield surpassing competition.

One of the important leadership methods for winning a bumper wheat harvest is to drive general fields through high-yield wheat plots. High-yield plots are bases for new technology experiments. The experience gained in high-yield plots can be used to guide the management of general fields. The achievements of high-yield plots can liberate people's minds and boost their motivation. At present, high-yield wheat plots in Hebei Province account for about 48% of the province's wheat planting area and are continuing to develop. According to two years of experience, a large area of high-yield plots, under unified management, can better exert the superiority of the People's Communes and create favorable conditions for comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Doing a good job in high-yield wheat plots, its output can account for 70% to 80% of the total wheat output, which has a decisive impact on completing and over fulfilling the summer leap forward plan.

After the high-yield plots are delineated, the old management content and leadership methods can no longer fully adapt to them, requiring the adoption of new management content and leadership methods. The "Ten-To Plot" proposed by Tang County provides a solution to this problem.

Political work is the soul of all work. To do a good job in large-area high-yield wheat plots, the first requirement is that political work reaches the plot. At present, large-area high-yield wheat plots are jointly operated by several or dozens of production teams, or even several communes. In production, it is necessary to implement unified management and change the past operating methods and old farming habits. This requires closer socialist collaboration between teams and communes and the promotion of new technologies. These also require people's thinking to be raised a step further. In vigorously grasping high-yield plots, Tang County first paid attention to strengthening political work, put forward the method of politics reaching the plot, and regularly conducted communist ideological education, so that the thinking of cadres and commune members can be continuously improved and the wheat yield surpassing competition can be continuously carried out.

The change in production form also requires leadership methods to adapt to it. High-yield plots have created favorable conditions for winning a great summer harvest, but whether a harvest can be won still depends on whether leadership is strengthened. After the emergence of large-area high-yield plots, the leadership in many areas has followed up; however, some cadres do not see the characteristics of high-yield plots, and leadership is still limited to general calls, which must be changed quickly. Large-area high-yield plots require high cultivation techniques and are jointly operated by many production teams, requiring unified planning and unified management to ensure consistent steps and actions. At present, some wheat high-yield plots have been delineated not long ago, and because the soil quality, water, fertilizer and other conditions of each team are different, and the strength of each team is also unbalanced, the time and content of cultivation are also different, and it is necessary to make different arrangements and organize necessary socialist collaboration under unified leadership. All this requires improving leadership methods to adapt to this new form of production. The method of leadership reaching the plot adopted by Tang County facilitates deeper leadership; further strengthens the ties between the Party and the masses; facilitates leadership cadres to participate in production and lead production with production; and helps to discover and solve problems in a timely manner.

Large-area high-yield plots have created extremely favorable conditions for comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. However, whether the "Eight-Character Charter" can be better implemented in high-yield plots still depends on the subjective initiative of people. At present, after delineating the plots in some areas, they are satisfied with "sufficient water and fertilizer last year, fine planting, and good growth," thus neglecting to strengthen scientific management in high-yield wheat plots, especially the current management. Tang County, on the contrary, recognizes that high-yield plots are a form of large-scale production that requires new cultivation techniques to adapt to, and has adopted measures such as technical guidance reaching the plot, scientific research reaching the plot, and meteorological work reaching the plot, establishing and improving the necessary scientific and technological guidance and research organizations, combining cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians, combining scientific and technological knowledge with the practical experience of farmers, and combining foreign experience with local experience. Through guidance, teaching, learning, and research, it is not only conducive to further exploring the secrets of nature and taking scientific and advanced measures in a timely manner according to the growth laws of crops, but also can cultivate a large number of scientific and technological talents, creating favorable conditions for further achieving a great harvest.

When promoting the "Ten-To Plot" measures, all regions, in addition to combining them with local conditions and applying them flexibly, it is more important to creatively learn from their experience and, according to local characteristics and conditions, summarize experience that is more suitable for local characteristics, so as to more effectively mobilize the masses and make the wheat yield surpassing competition more widely and deeply developed, and win a great summer harvest.

### 推广“十到丰产方”

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    推广“十到丰产方”
    1月11日，河北日报以“推广‘十到方’”为题发表社论，要求各地积极管好麦田，争取今年小麦大丰收。摘要如下：
    唐县为了实现1960年的农业生产继续跃进，学习安国县开展小麦超产携手赛的作法，大抓小麦丰产，普遍推行“十到方”的管理措施，使小麦超产携手赛大大地深入了一步。
    夺取小麦大丰收的重要领导方法之一，是通过小麦丰产方带动一般田。丰产方是新技术试验的基地，在丰产方取得的经验，可以用来指导一般田的管理，丰产方的成就，又可以解放人们的思想，鼓舞人们的干劲。目前河北省小麦丰产方约占全省小麦种植面积的48％，并且还在继续发展。根据两年来的经验，丰产方面积大，统一经营，可以更好地发挥人民公社的优越性，为综合执行农业“八字宪法”，创造良好的条件。搞好小麦丰产方，其产量可占小麦总产量的70％到80％，这对完成和超额完成夏季跃进计划有决定性的影响。
    丰产方划出之后，旧的管理内容与领导方法已经不能完全与之相适应，要求采用新的管理内容与领导方法。唐县提出的“十到方”为解决这个问题提供了办法。
    政治工作是一切工作的灵魂，搞好小麦大面积丰产方，首先要求政治工作到方。目前，小麦大面积丰产方，是几个或几十个生产队甚至几个公社联合经营的，在生产上，必须实行统一管理，改变过去的经营方式和旧的耕作习惯。这就要求各个队、社之间，更加密切地进行社会主义大协作，推行新技术。这些也要求人们的思想必须提高一步。唐县在大抓丰产方中，首先注意加强政治工作，提出政治到方的方法，经常进行共产主义思想教育，使干部、社员的思想不断提高，使小麦超产携手赛得到持续开展。
    生产形式的改变，也要求领导方法与之相适应。丰产方为夺取夏季大丰收创造了良好的条件，但是能不能夺得丰收，仍然决定于是否加强了领导。在大面积丰产方出现之后，许多地区的领导已经跟上去；但有的干部看不见丰产方的特点，领导仍然限于一般的号召，这种情况必须迅速改变。丰产方面积大，要求耕作技术高，又是很多生产队联合经营，要求进行统一规划，统一管理，使步调一致，行动一致。目前有的小麦丰产方划出不久，因各队的土质、水、肥等条件不相同，各队的力量也不平衡，在耕作的时间、内容上也有所不同，又需要在统一的领导下，作不同的安排和组织必要的社会主义协作。这一切都要求改善领导方法，适应这种新的生产形式。唐县采取的领导到方的作法，便于使领导更加深入；进一步密切党和群众的联系；便于领导干部参加生产，以生产领导生产；有助于及时地发现问题和解决问题。
    大面积丰产方，为综合执行农业“八字宪法”创造了极为有利的条件。但是在丰产方内，能否更好地执行“八字宪法”，仍然决定于人的能动作用。在目前，有些地区在划方之后，满足于“去年水、肥足，种的细，长的好”，因而忽视在小麦丰产方内加强科学管理，特别是当前的管理。唐县与此相反，他们认识到丰产方是大生产的形式，需要有新的耕作技术相适应，采取了技术指导到方、科学研究到方、气象工作到方等措施，建立健全了必要的科学技术指导、研究组织，使干部、老农、技术人员结合起来，使科学技术和农民的实际经验结合起来，使外地经验和本地经验结合起来，通过指导、传授、学习、研究，不仅有利于进一步探索大自然的秘密，能根据作物的生长规律，及时采取科学、先进的措施，而且可以培养大量的科学技术人材，为进一步实现大丰收创造良好的条件。
    各地在推广“十到方”的措施时，除了结合本地的情况，灵活加以运用外，更重要的是创造性地学习他们的经验，并根据本地的特点和条件，总结出更适合本地特点的经验，以便更有效地发动群众，使小麦超产携手赛更广泛深入地开展起来，夺取夏季大丰收。
