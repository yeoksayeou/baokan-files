Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 19th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company recently presented a silk banner to a motor vehicle battalion of a military unit in the Shenyang area of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, commending them for their important contributions to Anshan Iron and Steel's production in the past year.

This motor vehicle battalion, consisting of more than 1,200 officers and soldiers and more than 200 vehicles, entered Anshan in early March 1959. Over the past nine months, they have driven safely for more than 3,428,000 kilometers, transporting more than 1,070,000 tons of raw materials, construction equipment, and various supplies. While successfully completing their tasks, they also trained more than 1,500 motor vehicle drivers for the country, saved more than 60,000 kilograms of fuel, and saved more than 80,000 yuan in vehicle maintenance costs.

On the iron and steel transportation line, the officers and soldiers, with the heroic attitude of ensuring that the front line was not short of food and ammunition during the war years, acted as the "pioneers" of Anshan Iron and Steel. They overcame many difficulties, such as the rugged suburban roads, ensuring both safe driving and overfulfilling their tasks.

    沈阳地区部队某汽车队
    大力支援鞍钢建设
    据新华社鞍山19日电鞍山钢铁公司最近赠给中国人民解放军沈阳地区部队某汽车大队一面锦旗，表彰他们在过去一年中，为鞍钢生产作出的重要贡献。
    这支由一千二百多名官兵、二百多辆汽车组成的汽车大队，是1959年3月上旬开入鞍山的。九个多月来，他们安全行车三百四十二万八千多公里，运送原料、建筑器材和各种物资一百零七万多吨。在圆满完成任务的同时，他们还为国家培养了一千五百多名汽车驾驶员，节省油料六万多公斤，节约车辆保养费八万多元。
    在钢铁运输线上，官兵们以战争年代确保前线不缺粮弹的英雄姿态，充当着鞍钢的“先行官”。他们克服了郊区道路崎岖等许多困难，既保证了安全行驶，又超额完成了任务。
