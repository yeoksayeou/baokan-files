    How to Burn a Honeycomb Coal Stove
    Starting a Fire
    First, place the ignition brick on the grate, with the ash-yellow side facing down and the black side facing up. If the firewood brick and coal brick are separate, put the firewood brick first, then the coal brick. After placing the ignition brick, put two coal bricks on top in sequence. When placing the ignition brick and coal bricks, be careful to align the holes in the bricks. After the coal is placed, check if the top and bottom are tilted. If they are, first use stove ash to straighten the coal on the tilted side, and then fill the surrounding area with fine stove ash until it is level with the coal surface. After the coal ash is placed, use paper or wood shavings to ignite the ignition brick inside the stove door. After it is lit, the stove door only needs to be opened halfway; opening it too wide will allow too much cold air in, which will hinder the upward rise of the fire.
    Using the Fire
    Generally, the stove door should be opened to tend the fire about twenty minutes before using the fire. If the bottom fire is weak or a quick fire is needed, the stove door should be opened earlier, and a draft chimney should be added on top to accelerate the rise of the flame. When tending the fire, the stove door should not be opened too wide. If the flame hasn't risen, a kettle or pot can be placed on the stove. When using the fire, the stove door should still not be opened too wide; for general cooking, opening it only one-fifth is enough. Opening the stove door too wide will cause the fire to rush violently and easily form slag. If slagging occurs while using the fire, do not try to clear it immediately. Wait until the fire is no longer needed, then use a poker to gently poke downwards to avoid the coal collapsing.
    Adding Coal
    Looking down from the coal hole, if the middle coal brick is dark red, it needs to be refueled. The amount of coal added can be determined based on the fire usage or the strength of the bottom fire. When adding coal, the stove door should be closed first, and then the coal should be added. This can prevent stove ash from rushing upwards when pressing the coal. When putting coal, you must still pay attention to aligning the holes. After the coal is placed, press down firmly on the coal surface with a brick or wooden board, but do not press too hard, to avoid losing the bottom fire.
    Sometimes, a collapse of the stove will occur when adding coal. The reason for the collapse is generally that the coal has burned too much, causing the coal to be damaged when adding coal. If the stove collapses, you can first put an ignition brick on it, then add a coal brick, and then gently press down.
    Sealing the Fire
    Closing the stove door after using the fire counts as sealing the fire. You can also close the stove door five to ten minutes before finishing using the fire. This will prevent the fire from being smothered. If the fire is strong when sealing the fire and the stove door is not tight, you can add a fire cover on the coal surface after closing the stove door. When covering the fire cover, do not cover all the coal holes; leave a small gap.
    If the fire is smothered or the coal burns too much after sealing the fire, it is related to the tightness of the stove door and the operation when sealing the fire. After buying the stove, it is best to do a few sealing fire tests first to learn the rules. If the fire goes out due to unfamiliarity with the sealing fire operation, there is no need to remove all the stove ash. The extent of the coal brick combustion can be used to determine how to handle it.

### 怎样烧蜂窝煤炉

    怎样烧蜂窝煤炉
    升火
    先把引火砖放在炉篦上，将灰黄色一面朝底，黑色一面朝上。如果柴砖和炭砖分开的，要先放柴砖，再放炭砖。放好引火砖后，再依次放上两块煤砖。在放引火砖和煤砖时，要注意对正砖和砖的孔。煤放好后，再看看上下是否倾斜，如有倾斜，可在倾斜的一面，先用炉灰把煤填直，然后在煤的周围用细炉灰填到和煤面相平。煤灰放好后，用纸或刨花在炉门里燃点引火砖。点着后炉门只要开一小半就行，开大了，冷空气过多，反而会阻碍火力上升。
    用　火
    一般在用火前二十分钟左右就得打开炉门养火，如发现底火不旺或需要用急火，应提前打开炉门，上面加上拔火筒，就可以加速火苗的上升。在养火的时候，炉门也不宜开得太大，火苗没有上来，炉上也可以座壶座锅。用火的时候，炉门仍然不宜开得太大，一般的做饭做菜，只要开五分之一就行。炉门开大了，火力猛冲，容易结渣。在用火时如果发生结渣现象，暂时不必通它，等不用火的时候再用通条轻轻往下通，以避免煤向下塌。
    添　煤
    从煤孔往下看，中间的一块煤砖发暗红色，就需要添煤。添煤数量，可根据用火情况或底火强弱来决定。加煤的时候应先把炉门关上，然后放煤。这样可以避免压煤时炉灰上冲。在放煤的时候仍须注意孔与孔对正。等煤放好后，用砖或木板按住煤面，用力稳稳下压，但也不要压得过实，以免损失底火。
    添煤的时候，有时会发生塌炉现象。造成塌炉的原因，一般是煤烧过分了，在加煤时将煤压损所致。塌了炉，可先放上一块引火砖，再加一块煤砖，然后轻轻下压。
    封　火
    用完火后将炉门关上，就算封火，也可在用完火前五至十分钟把炉门关上。这样不致把火闷死。如遇封火时火力较旺，炉门又不严密，可将炉门关上后，在煤面上再加一火盖。盖火盖时不要把所有的煤孔全部盖住，要留点小缝。
    火封上以后如果发生火蹩死或煤烧得过分的现象，那与炉门的严密和封火时的操作有关。炉子买回来以后，最好先做几次封火试验，摸摸规律。如果万一由于封火操作不熟练而发生灭火时，也不必将炉灰全部掏出，可看煤砖燃烧的程度处理。
