This year will be recorded in the history of the motherland in golden letters. This is the great victory of the Workers' Party of Korea's policy of developing light industry and agriculture simultaneously, with heavy industry as the main focus, and a brilliant and creative manifestation of Marxism-Leninism in Korea.
	The editorial said that agricultural mechanization is an urgent requirement after our country's agriculture completes water conservancy, and it is the most important task of this year's buffer period. This year, our heavy industry base and light industry base will be further consolidated, and there will be tremendous changes in the development of local industries. The party's battle cry of "producing more products with existing labor and equipment" must be implemented in all economic sectors. This year must be made a year of great strides forward in the technological and cultural revolutions.
	The editorial said that in the new year, the strength of our people fighting for the peaceful reunification of the motherland will be further strengthened, and the US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique will be further completely isolated.

	The editorial said that so far, more than 28,000 agricultural production cooperatives have been established in North Vietnam, accounting for 44% of the total number of farm households. Nearly 200,000 handicraftsmen have joined various cooperative organizations. 45% of private industrial and commercial households have accepted transformation and become state capitalist economy. The total grain output in 1959 reached 5.2 million tons, an increase of 600,000 tons over last year. The total output value of industry and handicrafts increased by 30% over last year (of which state-owned industry increased by 51%). For the first time, the total output value of state-owned industry, joint state-private industry, and cooperativized handicrafts exceeded the total output value of private industry and individual handicrafts.
	The editorial said that 1959 was not only a year of extraordinary achievements in the economic and cultural fields, but also a year of ideological harvest.

	The editorial reviewed the achievements of 1959 and pointed out that in terms of agricultural and animal husbandry production, the working herdsmen have high enthusiasm for production, increasing the number of livestock by more than 452,000 heads, and the agricultural harvest is an important event in the history of Mongolian agricultural and animal husbandry development.

With the help of brotherly countries such as the Soviet Union and China, new factories have been put into production one after another.

	Our Newspaper Tirana Telegram　The Albanian "Zëri i Popullit" published an editorial on January 1st, warmly congratulating the people of the whole country on the New Year. The editorial said that 1959 brought us fruitful results. In the past year, Albania's industrial production level has reached the level that the Third Party Congress stipulated should be reached in 1960, and agriculture has increased by 26% compared to 1955. In 1960, the Labor Party has once again set us great tasks. In the new year, Albania's total industrial output value will increase by 11% compared to 1959, and agricultural output value will increase by 33%. The great program of the second five-year plan will be completed ahead of schedule.
	The editorial described how the Albanian people have gloriously and arduously built socialism in the struggle against imperialism and everything else, saying that our people have consistently given the enemy the response they deserve, and our people have ruthlessly exposed in the past, and will continue to expose in the future, imperialism and its loyal servants—the enemies of socialism and our country, the Yugoslav revisionists.

Czechoslovak "Rudé Právo" Calls for Creating New Achievements to Welcome the Fifteenth Anniversary of Liberation
	Our Newspaper Prague Telegram　The "Rudé Právo" published an editorial on January 1st entitled "On the Threshold of the Fifteenth Anniversary," saying that the first hope of the Czechoslovak people for the new year is peace for the whole world and all mankind, but this peace must be won through action.
	The editorial pointed out that 1960 is the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet army. In the past fifteen years, the Czechoslovak Republic has grown up, and it has become exceptionally strong because of the people's firm will to complete socialist construction in the shortest possible time, and because of the Soviet Union's help, support, and example.
	When talking about the tasks facing the Czechoslovak people this year, the editorial pointed out that in the national economy, agricultural production should achieve a decisive turning point, and agriculture should catch up with the pace of industrial production as quickly as possible with the help of the entire working class and all working people.
	The editorial also talked about how this year, while industrial and agricultural production are increasing, Czechoslovakia will complete wage reform, greatly improve the organization of local state power, and hold elections for people's committees and the National Assembly at all levels, which are all events of far-reaching significance.
	The editorial said that on the occasion of welcoming the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia, a mass movement to beautify villages and welcome the National Day is being launched in the countryside. In factories, it can be seen that people have not only changed their relationship with production, planning, and factories, but also the relationship between people, between individuals and society. In factories and rural areas, the working people are creating new achievements every moment.

Romanian "Scînteia" Says the First Year of the New Five-Year Plan Is in Good Shape
	Our Newspaper Bucharest Telegram　The "Scînteia" published an editorial on the 3rd entitled "The Beginning of a Year."
	The editorial said that in 1960, our country's industrial production will increase by 14%, and steel production will reach 1.7 million tons.
	The editorial then talked about the achievements of the socialist transformation of agriculture. The editorial said that in 1959, the cultivated area of the socialist agricultural sector accounted for 72% of the country's total cultivated area. The living standards of farmers are also constantly improving.
	The editorial said that there is no doubt that in the new year, the masses' endless creativity will be more fully exerted. We all remember the example of 1959, when the working people of our country proposed a guarantee to save 1 billion lei from the beginning of the year. This guarantee was not only completed, but also overfulfilled, that is, 1.5 billion lei were saved.
	The editorial said that the Romanian Workers' Party has issued a call to concentrate all efforts to increase industrial and agricultural production, increase labor productivity, and reduce production costs. The Romanian people will respond to the party's call with serious, resolute, and courageous labor in 1960.
	The editorial concluded by saying that 1960 is the year in which the Third Party Congress will be held, and it is also the first year of the implementation of the 1960-1965 national economic development plan. This year is a year that will bring us closer to the task of basically ending socialist construction and moving towards the stage of completion of socialist construction.

Hungarian "Népszabadság" Points Out That This Year Continues to Move Forward with Favorable Conditions
	Our Newspaper Budapest Telegram　The Hungarian "Népszabadság" published an editorial on January 1st, pointing out that Hungary's socialist construction has made new developments in 1959. New basic construction projects have been put into production one after another. The socialist transformation of agriculture has also made great progress, and most farmers have embarked on the road to happiness. The achievements already made in completing the three-year plan ahead of schedule have created favorable conditions for continuing to move forward this year. The national economy will be further developed in 1960.
	The editorial pointed out that the growth of peaceful forces in the world is the source of our confidence in the new year. The great goals of the Soviet seven-year plan, the Soviet scientific and technological victories of world significance, and the construction achievements of socialist countries show that today the socialist camp has greater advantages than the imperialist bloc.
	The editorial said that 1960 is the year in which the old decade ends and the new decade begins. The past decade was a decade of arduous struggle and effort, and the Soviet Union and the socialist camp countries have achieved great development, which has caused the world balance of power to change decisively in favor of the socialist camp. The new decade that is now beginning will see the socialist system surpass the entire capitalist world economically in the peaceful competition between the two world systems.
	The editorial concluded by pointing out that we welcome the new year with confidence. We know that there are still some difficulties, and we must unite to overcome all difficulties to achieve our goals. Our destiny is in our own hands. The achievements of the new year will depend on our enthusiastic labor.

Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo" Points Out That Bulgaria Is Advancing at a High Speed
	Our Newspaper Sofia Telegram　The Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo" published an editorial on January 1st entitled "Celebrating a Bumper Year." The editorial said that 1959 was full of wonderful labor undertakings. Last year, the speed of our country's economic development was twice as fast as that stipulated by the third five-year plan. The growth rate of total social output and national income was also twice as fast. At the same time, the people's actual income also increased rapidly.
	The total value of industrial products last year increased by about 25%. Now, the products produced by some basic industrial sectors in one month or less are equivalent to the products produced by old Bulgaria in one year. Despite the poor climatic conditions in some parts of the country, the country produced about 26% more agricultural products last year than the year before, which is unprecedented.
	Life fully proves the correctness of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee's program for accelerating our country's development. Now, the working people are more closely united around the Bulgarian Communist Party and its Central Committee, and are exerting their creative forces.
	Our people are full of confidence in completing the tasks of 1960. Now, the main and most important thing is to successfully complete this year's plan passed by the National Assembly and ensure the continued high-speed development of the economy.
	The editorial concluded by saying that our working people know from their own experience that victory and achievement will not come by themselves. We must strive for them with tenacious labor, fight against all kinds of difficulties, and we must have a bold spirit and will. The socialist system has opened up a vast and boundless horizon for our country, and our country is advancing at a high speed.
