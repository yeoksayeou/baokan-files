　　Expanding Irrigation Area of Existing Water Conservancy Projects
　　Gaoan Increases Reservoir Capacity through Multiple Measures, Gannan Rushes to Repair Existing Projects

　　(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 25th) While actively building water conservancy projects, Gaoan County, Jiangxi Province, is vigorously expanding and improving existing engineering facilities to maximize their benefits.

　　In formulating the county's water conservancy plan for achieving self-flowing irrigation this winter and next spring, the Gaoan County Committee of the Communist Party of China required the expansion and improvement of more than 800 existing projects while completing new and continued construction projects. Currently, more than 50,000 workers are working day and night on the construction sites. All new and expanded projects have entered the late stages of construction, and the expansion and improvement of 315 projects have been completed. After expansion and improvement, the irrigation benefits of these existing projects have generally increased by 30% to over 100% compared to the past.

　　In expanding existing projects, Gaoan County has adopted many methods to increase the water storage capacity of the projects. The main methods are: 1. Raising earth dams to expand the capacity of reservoirs; 2. Building small reservoirs along the canal using the mountain ridges to intercept and store floodwater, which both irrigates fields and prevents floods; 3. Building dikes around the periphery of flat ponds to store water; 4. Adding river dams on rivers and streams to divert water into reservoirs, expanding the water source; 5. Building small ditches in front of the dam base and beside the canals to collect the water seeping out of the reservoirs and canals and divert it into ponds for storage, so as not to lose a single drop of water. The Gongqingtuan Reservoir, built by Dongfanghong Commune last spring, could only irrigate more than 3,000 mu of farmland. This winter and spring, the commune organized its members to expand the reservoir, increasing the height of the earth dam from the original 9 meters to 19 meters, increasing the storage capacity from the original 2.8 million cubic meters to more than 9 million cubic meters, and expanding the benefited area to 15,000 mu.

　　In expanding and improving existing projects, Gaoan County comprehensively reorganized the canals to achieve a reasonable canal layout and form a system, so as to give full play to the benefits of existing projects. The methods are: connecting large, medium, and small projects with canals according to the needs of building a water conservancy network; building new canals or extending existing canals to connect reservoirs and fields through canals; repairing existing canals, raising and reinforcing canal foundations, and blocking loopholes to make the canals strong and durable.

　　After Gaoan County completes its plan to expand and improve 844 old projects this spring, it will expand the irrigation area by more than 90,000 mu and improve the irrigation area by 190,000 mu.

　　(Our newspaper, Harbin, 25th) In order to fully tap the potential of existing water conservancy projects, Gannan County, Heilongjiang Province, is vigorously repairing and expanding existing projects and unfinished projects so that existing water conservancy projects can fully play their irrigation role this year.

　　For the past two years, Gannan County has actively and conscientiously implemented the policy of "storing water as the main priority, small-scale as the main priority, and community-run as the main priority," and the combination of large, medium, and small scales, and has achieved great success in water conservancy construction. However, some water conservancy projects have not yet been fully equipped, so that some completed projects have not been able to fully exert their irrigation efficiency. At the beginning of the winter water conservancy movement in 1959, the county party committee, based on the principle of supplementing whatever is lacking, and according to the needs of large, medium and small projects and new and old projects, uniformly organized and used labor. Of the county's 9,000 water conservancy construction personnel, more than 8,000 people, in addition to the 1,300 people engaged in new construction projects, launched a crash repair and expansion of existing projects, achieving a focused assault on different fronts, combining new and old projects. For example, in order to expand the irrigation area of the Yinhe Reservoir in 1960, the Hongqi, Changshan, and Yinhe communes concentrated 2,500 people to carry out the main water diversion canal project, and expanded the 17 main water diversion lines that had been excavated in 1958 by another 20 main water diversion lines. At present, 79% of the total earthwork has been completed. After all work is completed, the water conservancy irrigation area in 1960 will increase from more than 53,000 mu in 1959 to more than 177,000 mu.

　　At present, nearly 10,000 water conservancy troops in the county are fighting against the cold weather, and the movement of technical innovation and tool reform on various water conservancy construction sites is in full swing. More than half of the water conservancy construction sites have realized mechanized earthwork construction, and the average work efficiency has reached 3.5 cubic meters.

### 扩大旧有水利工程灌溉面积  高安多方增加工程蓄水量　甘南突击修补现有工程

    扩大旧有水利工程灌溉面积
    高安多方增加工程蓄水量　甘南突击修补现有工程
    本报南昌25日电　江西高安县在积极兴建水利工程的同时，大力扩建与改善已有工程设施，使这些工程发挥更大效益。
    中共高安县委在制定去冬今春全县实现灌溉自流化的水利计划中，要求在完成新建、续建工程的同时，扩建与改善已有工程八百多座。目前，全县有五万多名民工正在工地上日夜奋战，全部新建、扩建工程都已进入后期施工，并有三百一十五座工程的扩建与改善的任务已经完成。这些旧有工程经过扩建与改善后，灌溉效益一般都比过去提高了30％至一倍以上。
    在扩建已有工程中，高安县采取了许多办法以增加工程的蓄水量。主要的办法有：一、加高土坝，扩大水库的容量；二、沿渠利用山垅建筑小水库，拦洪蓄水，既灌田又防洪；三、在平塘四周筑基蓄水；四、在河溪上加建拦河坝，引水入库，扩大水源；五、在水库的坝基前和渠旁修建小水沟，把水库、渠道渗透出来的水汇集引入水塘，积蓄起来，以做到滴水不失。东方红公社去春建成的共青团水库，只可以灌溉农田三千多亩。去冬今春公社组织社员扩建了这座水库，把土坝由原来高九米加高到十九米，使蓄水量由原来的二百八十万公方增加到九百多万公方，受益面积扩大到一万五千亩。
    在扩建与改善已有工程中，高安县全面整理了渠道，达到渠道布局合理，形成系统，以充分发挥已有工程效益。办法是：按照建设水利网的需要，把大、中、小工程用渠道联接起来；增建新渠道或延长已有渠道，通过渠道把库与田联接起来；修理已有渠道，加高加固渠基，堵塞漏洞，使渠道坚固耐用。
    高安县今春全部完成扩大与改善八百四十四座旧有工程的计划后，将扩大灌溉面积九万多亩，改善灌溉面积十九万亩。
    本报哈尔滨25日电　为充分挖掘现有水利工程的潜力，黑龙江省甘南县大力整修、扩建原有工程和未完工工程，使现有水利工程今年能充分发挥灌溉作用。
    两年来，甘南县积极地认真地贯彻了“蓄水为主，小型为主，社办为主”和大中小型相结合的方针，在水利建设上取得了巨大成绩。但是，有些水利工程还未配成套，使得有些已建成的工程未能全部发挥灌溉效能。1959年冬修水利运动一开始，县委就本着缺啥补啥的原则，根据大中小工程和新老工程的需要，统一组织和使用了劳动力。全县九千多名水利建设人员，除一千三百多人搞新建工程外，有八千多人突击修补和扩建原有工程，作到了有重点的分战线突击，使新老工程相结合。如红旗、长山、音河三个公社，为了扩大1960年音河水库灌溉面积，集中了二千五百人大搞引水干渠工程，在1958年已开挖的十七条引水干线的基础上，再扩大二十条引水干线。目前已完成总土方的79％，全部完工后，1960年水利灌溉面积将由1959年的五万三千多亩，增加到十七万七千多亩。
    目前，全县近万名水利大军与寒天冻地搏斗，各水利工地的技术革新和工具改革运动热火朝天，已有半数以上的水利工地实现了土机械化施工，平均工效达到三点五方。
