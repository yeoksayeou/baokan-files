    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 23rd: The well-known Soviet cosmonautics expert, Sternfeld, has recently published articles and given talks introducing the flight characteristics of Soviet multi-stage ballistic missiles.

    Sternfeld said in an article published in "Soviet Russia" on the 23rd that after the rocket is launched, it quickly penetrates the atmosphere and spends almost all of its time flying at high altitude. Therefore, the actual air resistance is very small. Eighteen minutes and fifteen seconds after liftoff, the rocket reaches its highest point, at an altitude of approximately 1,232 kilometers above the Earth. After reaching the highest point, the rocket's forward speed decreases due to the influence of the Earth's gravity, decreasing to a minimum of 21,740 kilometers per hour, a 20% reduction from its maximum speed. As the rocket approaches its descent back to the Earth's surface, it reaches its maximum speed again, 27,120 kilometers per hour. This should be thirty-six minutes and five seconds after the rocket's liftoff. Therefore, if the rocket's landing time in the designated area of the Pacific Ocean is 20:05, then the rocket's launch time should be 19:29.

    Sternfeld also said in the article that the length of the rocket's actual flight path, or trajectory, should be 14.2% longer than the ground distance between the liftoff and landing points, which is 14,290 kilometers. The rocket's average speed is 23,500 kilometers per hour. The rocket's flight trajectory is a section of an elliptical arc. One focus of the ellipse is at the center of the Earth, and the other focus is 3,550 kilometers away from the Earth's center.

    Sternfeld also said that the actual flight trajectory will of course have additions and corrections, but the above calculations are very close to the actual situation. The fact that the rocket landed very close to the designated location demonstrates that all the equipment is very precise and all the calculations are very accurate. To achieve this level of accuracy, the rocket's speed error must not exceed 20 centimeters per second. This extremely high accuracy ensures that rockets can be sent to other planets in the near future.

    Sternfeld told a TASS reporter on the 22nd that the speed error of the ballistic missile launched by the Soviet Union into the Pacific Ocean was three parts per 100,000, and the error of the launch angle was only sixteen seconds in total.

    In the current situation where rocket technology is advancing at an unprecedented speed, this accuracy completely exceeds expectations. If the speed deviation of the Soviet Union's cosmic rocket launched to the moon was one meter per second, then this index has now been improved at least four times, reaching 20 centimeters per second.

    Sternfeld said that the ballistic missile first flew vertically upwards for tens of kilometers. Then, it began to fly at a very small angle – about seventeen degrees – relative to the horizontal line. It was this angle that ensured that the rocket flew to a location 12,500 kilometers from the launch point in the most cost-effective manner and at the minimum speed. The rocket's ascent altitude exceeded the flight altitude of the Soviet Union's third artificial Earth satellite.

    Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: According to TASS news: The famous Soviet chemist, Woolfkovich, told TASS reporters that the successful launch of a multi-stage ballistic missile to the Pacific region is not only a major victory for Soviet physicists, mathematicians, and mechanics, but also a major victory for Soviet chemists, who have created new rocket fuels and new high-temperature resistant alloys.

    He said that the fuel and oxidizers created by Soviet scientists can clearly be considered the best dynamic raw materials for intercontinental flight currently possessed by mankind. Soviet scientists have successfully created some specialized alloys and other materials that can keep the model of the final stage intact when the rocket returns to the dense atmosphere. Apart from the Soviet rocket that landed in the Pacific this time, no other object has been able to withstand such strong friction with the air. (Attached picture)

    苏联科学家介绍弹道火箭的情况
    新火箭造的巧飞的快射的准
    据新华社莫斯科23日电　苏联著名宇宙飞行学家斯特恩菲尔德最近两天分别发表文章和谈话，介绍苏联多级弹道火箭的飞行情况。
    斯特恩菲尔德23日在“苏维埃俄罗斯报”发表文章说，火箭发射后，迅速穿过大气层，几乎所有时间都在高空飞行，因此，实际的空气阻力是很小的。火箭起飞后十八分十五秒钟，即达到最高点，这时的高度大约是离地球一千二百三十二公里。到达最高点之后，由于地心吸力的影响，火箭前进的速度减低，最低减少到每小时二万一千七百四十公里，比它的最高速度减少20％。当火箭快回落到地球表面的时候，火箭又达到它的最高速度，即每小时二万七千一百二十公里，这应该是在火箭起飞后的三十六分五秒的时间。因此，如果火箭降落到太平洋预定地区的时间是二十点五分的话，那么，火箭起飞的时间就应该是十九点二十九分。
    斯特恩菲尔德还在文章中说，火箭真正飞行的道路即轨道的长度，应该比起飞和降落点之间的地面距离多14．2％，即一万四千二百九十公里。火箭飞行的平均速度是二万三千五百公里。火箭飞行的轨道是椭圆形的一段弧线。椭圆形的一个焦点在地中心，另一个焦点在离地心三千五百五十公里的地方。
    斯特恩菲尔德还说，实际飞行的轨道状况当然有补充和修正，但上面这些计算是非常接近于实际情况的。火箭下降的地点和预定的地点非常近，这一事实说明一切有关设备都非常精密，全部计算都非常准确。为了达到这种准确程度，火箭飞行的速度误差每秒不得超过二十厘米。这种极高的准确性，就保证了在不久的将来就能把火箭送上其他行星上去。
    斯特恩菲尔德22日对塔斯社记者发表谈话说，苏联发射到太平洋区域的弹道火箭的速度误差为十万分之三，起飞角的误差总共只有十六秒。
    在目前火箭技术以空前的速度向前发展的情况下，这种准确性也完全超出了所能预料的程度。如果说，苏联向月球发射宇宙火箭时的速度偏差为每秒钟一米的话，那么，现在这个指标起码提高了四倍，即达到每秒钟二十厘米。
    斯特恩菲尔德说，弹道火箭首先垂直向上飞行了数十公里。然后，开始以同水平线相交很小的角度——约十七度——飞行。正是这样的角度保证了火箭以最合算的方式和最小的速度飞到了距发射点一万二千五百公里的地点。火箭的上升高度超过了苏联第三个人造地球卫星的飞行高度。
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社消息：苏联著名化学家汪尔夫科维奇向塔斯社记者说，向太平洋地区发射多级弹道火箭成功，不仅是苏联物理学家、数学家和机械学家的重大胜利，而且也是苏联化学家的重大胜利，他们制成了新型的火箭燃料和新的耐高温的合金。
    他说，苏联科学家制造的燃料和氧化剂，显然可以认为是现在人类拥有的用于洲际飞行的动力原料中最好的东西。苏联科学家制造成功了一些专门的合金和其他材料，这些东西能在火箭回到稠密的大气层中的时候保持最后一级的模型完整无损。除了这次降落在太平洋中的苏联火箭外，还没有哪一个物体能经得住同空气作这样强力的摩擦。（附图片）
