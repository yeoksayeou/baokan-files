    Hefei is Flying
    Yu Ming
    A heavy industry line, along the Tianjin-Pukou and Huainan Railways, runs vertically through Anhui from north to south, with coal, iron, and copper. And the provincial capital, Hefei, is right in the middle of this line. Both the Yangtze River and the Huai River traverse Anhui, and Hefei is close to both the Yangtze and the Huai, its position precisely in the center between the two rivers. Therefore, Hefei is now not only the political and cultural center of the province but has also become the industrial and transportation center of the province. If people come to Hefei from Shanghai and Beijing by plane, they can see Anhui's famous "small foreign group" steel base and the river network project that is transforming nature all within one day.
    Hefei is an ancient city. Sima Qian mentioned it in the "Records of the Grand Historian." It has historical sites such as Cao Cao's reviewing stand and Xiaoyao Ford. The "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" describes "Zhang Liao awe-inspiring at Xiaoyao Ford," saying that Cao's troops in Hefei routed Sun Quan, who lost his armor and abandoned his troops. There is also the ancestral hall of Bao Gong, the hometown of Bao Zheng, the "iron-faced and selfless" official of the Song Dynasty. However, this ancient place, under feudal reactionary rule, was riddled with holes. Only after liberation, in the hands of the people, did it gain a beautiful youth. Its changes over the past decade have made it impossible for newcomers to understand the desolation of the past; those who had visited Hefei before cannot recognize the original place. Upon seeing it, they cannot help but be both surprised and delighted, as if they are witnessing the rapid progress of the entire motherland.
    Comrades who came to Hefei ten years ago said that when they arrived in Hefei at that time, the railway station had no platform or station building, only a small thatched shed, as if they had arrived in a remote village; the urban area was full of dilapidated houses; the streets were narrow, winding, uneven, and covered with sewage, ditches, and ponds, with a foul stench. At night, it was pitch black, with only a few faint lights flickering at the entrances of a few shops.
    When I arrived in Hefei in 1955, the people of Hefei were stepping up the transformation of the city. An east-west thoroughfare through the city—Changjiang Road—had asphalt that was not yet dry, and the buildings along the street had just begun to be built. I witnessed how the people of Hefei concentrated their efforts to replace the old with the new, building this street and transforming the gardens. Then, using this as an axis, both the new and old districts were built simultaneously. In these short few years, Hefei has completely transformed: streets are brand new, and vibrant flower gardens are set off by new building complexes. In the past decade, the urban area of Hefei has expanded tenfold. The newly built factory area alone is equivalent to 1.6 times the entire city's building area at the time of liberation. Hefei's construction is fast, efficient, economical, and practical, fully reflecting the characteristics of socialist urban construction.
    Five years ago, I visited Hefei's industry. At that time, there was only a small area under construction in the eastern suburbs, and most of the production was light industrial goods such as textiles, farm tools, cork, and enamel. But now, looking at the suburbs, from north to east, and from east to south, the emerging steel industry and machinery industry factories are scattered like stars in the sky, stretching endlessly. The wilderness outside Shuixi Gate has become a "small foreign group" steel base, with the red glow of molten iron reflecting in the sky. Rolling mills spew out fiery dragons of steel bars, and trains frequently transport neat blocks of iron, ingots, and steel, bringing in ample ore and coke. In the textile factory in the eastern suburbs, rows of textile machines are arranged in the factory buildings like undulating waves. In the southwestern suburbs, a mechanical industrial center was formed in just one year of construction.
    I will never forget the autumn of 1958. At that time, every evening, ten thousand furnaces were lit, and every adult in the city had their own post: some went to the furnace to start steelmaking and ironmaking; some went to the transportation line; on the hard cement roads, stone rollers pressed fire-resistant mud all night long; mothers gently put their children to bed and made crucibles in their homes… In each courtyard, from ironmaking to steelmaking, there were various small earthen furnaces and small foreign furnaces. From the responsible comrades of the provincial and municipal party committees to every citizen of the city, everyone was an expert and everyone was a student. Perhaps each furnace only produced dozens of kilograms of pig iron, but they were as happy as if they had won a battle. We finally found the path to the Great Leap Forward in iron and steel. While steel was being made in these small courtyards, the fastest and best way had already been chosen in the suburbs to build the "small foreign group" steel base. "Just as the east wind came last night, thousands of trees and ten thousand trees of pear blossoms bloomed," Hefei, in this way, rapidly transformed into an industrial city.
    If anyone doesn't believe this miracle, come and see it for yourself: In the first half of 1958, the city was still a blank slate in steel production, but after the mass movement to greatly develop steel, in 1959, it was able to produce 400,000 tons of good iron. The rolling mill workshop of the Hefei Steel Plant alone caught up with the production of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company in 1958 in just one year. Hefei, which had only a few blacksmith shops before liberation, now has more than 60 metal processing plants in its machinery industry because the "steel marshal" has taken office, including 17 large-scale machine manufacturing plants with modern equipment, which can not only produce complete sets of mining, transportation, smelting, power, agricultural, chemical, and textile machinery but also produce many larger and more precise mechanical equipment. For example, a mining machinery plant can produce 20,000 tons of mining machinery annually; a machine tool plant can produce 2,000 machine tools annually. In addition, the chemical industry and light industry have also made great progress. The number of industrial workers in the city now is more than twice the total population of the city ten years ago.
    Before liberation, Hefei not only had no universities but also only one complete middle school. Now, the city has fourteen universities and colleges, with more than 11,000 students, which is more than twice the number of primary school students enrolled before liberation; the number of middle schools has increased more than tenfold, and primary education has become universal. The number of hospitals has increased tenfold, medical institutions have been established everywhere, and the number of beds has increased nearly a hundredfold compared to before liberation. Huangmei Opera, which was banned by the reactionaries before liberation, has now been nurtured by the Party and has become a genre loved by everyone, praised by audiences across the country. There are also local operas with rich local characteristics, such as Sizhou Opera, Lu Opera, and Hui Opera.
    Hefei is flying! You ancient and young city, spread your wings, face the bright morning sun, and take advantage of the fierce east wind to fly higher and faster! (Attached picture)

    合肥在飞
    于明
    一条重工业线，沿津浦、淮南铁路，纵贯安徽南北，有煤、有铁、有铜。而省会合肥，正在这条线的正中。长江、淮河都横贯安徽，合肥离长江、淮河都近，地位也恰在江淮之间的正中。所以，合肥现在不但是全省的政治文化中心，而且已成为全省工业交通中心。人们如果从上海和北京乘飞机来合肥，只要在一天之内，便能看到安徽著名的小洋群钢铁基地和改造大自然的河网化工程了。
    合肥是个古老的城市。司马迁在史记里就提到它了。这里有曹操点将台和逍遥津等古迹，三国演义里就有“张辽威震逍遥津”的描述，说曹兵在合肥，把孙权杀得丢盔弃甲。这里还有包公的祠堂，是宋朝“铁面无私”的包拯的家乡。但是这个古老的地方，在封建反动统治下，一直是千疮百孔，只有解放以后，在人民的手里，它才获得了美丽的青春。它十年来的变化，使新来的人无法理解过去的荒凉；使曾经来过合肥的人，不能辨认原来的地方，一看到它，便禁不住又惊又喜，好像看到了整个祖国的突飞猛进。
    在十年前就到合肥来的同志们说，那时他们到了合肥，火车站没有站台和站房，只有一个小草棚，就像到了一个偏僻的村镇；市区内满城是破烂的房屋；街道窄狭弯曲，高低不平，遍地污水、沟塘，臭气熏人。入夜，一片漆黑，只少数商店门口有几点微弱的灯光在摇摆晃动……。
    1955年我到合肥时，合肥人民正在加紧改造这个城市。一条东西穿城干道——长江路，柏油未干，沿街楼房才开始起建。我亲眼看着合肥人民，怎样集中力量，去旧换新，建设了这条街道，改造了庭园。然后以此为轴线，新区旧区同时建设。就在这短短几年里，合肥完全变成了另外一个样子：一条条街道焕然一新，万紫千红的花园衬托着新建筑群。十年来，合肥市区面积整整扩大了十倍，只是新建的厂房面积，就相当于解放时全市房屋面积的一点六倍。合肥的建设多快好省，朴素适用，它充分反映了社会主义城市建设的特征。
    五年前，我曾参观合肥的工业，那时只有东郊一小片刚开始建设，生产的大半是纺织、农具、软木、搪瓷等轻工业物品。可是现在，到郊区看看，从北到东，从东到南，新兴的钢铁工业和机械工业工厂，星罗棋布，连绵不断。水西门外的荒野，已变成小洋群钢铁基地，铁水红光映天，轧钢机吐出了一条条的火龙，火车频繁运走整齐的铁块、钢锭和钢材，带来了充足的矿石和焦炭。东郊纺织厂，一排排纺织机器像起伏的波浪一样排列在厂房里；西南郊开始建设仅仅一年，就形成了一个机械工业中心。
    我怎么也忘不了1958年的秋天，那时，每到黄昏，万炉升火，全市每个成年人都有自己的岗位：有的走到炉边开始炼钢炼铁；有的走上了运输线；坚硬的水泥路上，整夜有石磙磙压着耐火泥；母亲们把孩子轻轻放在床上，就在房子里做起了坩埚……。一个个场院里，从炼铁到炼钢，有各种各样的小土炉、小洋炉，从省市委负责同志到全市每个市民，谁也都是能手，谁也都是学生。也许每炉仅仅炼出几十斤生铁吧，却像打了一场胜仗那样的高兴。我们终于找到钢铁跃进之路。就在一个个小场院里这样炼着钢铁的时候，在郊区已经选择了最快最好的办法，建设小洋群钢铁基地了。“恰如昨夜东风来，千树万树梨花开”，合肥，就是这样高速度变成工业城市的。
    谁不相信这个奇迹，就到这里来看看吧：1958年上半年全市还是钢铁生产的空白点，可是经过大办钢铁的群众运动，1959年就能生产四十万吨好铁，只是合肥钢厂的一个轧钢车间，一年之间就赶上了马鞍山钢铁公司1958年的产量。解放前只有几个铁匠铺的合肥，现在因为钢铁元帅上马，机械工业已有六十多个金属加工厂，其中有十七个大型的具有现代化设备的机器制造厂，不但能生产成套的采矿、运输、冶炼、电力、农业、化工和纺织机械，而且能生产许多较大型和精密的机械设备。如一个矿山机器厂，可年产两万吨矿山机械；一个机床厂可年产二千台机床。此外，化学工业和轻工业也有了很大发展。全市现在工业职工的人数，比十年前全市总人口还多一倍。
    解放前，合肥不但没有高等学校，连完全中学也只有一所，而现在全市有十四座大专学校，学生一万一千多人，比解放前在校的小学生数还多一倍以上；中学增加十倍以上，小学则已普及。医院增加十倍，医疗机构普设，而病床比解放前增加了近百倍。解放前被反动派禁演的黄梅戏，在这里经过党的哺育，现在变成了人人喜爱的剧种，受到全国各地观众的赞扬。这里还有富有地方色彩的泗州戏、庐剧、徽剧。
    合肥在飞！你古老而又年青的城市啊，张开翅膀，迎着灿烂的朝阳，趁着猛烈的东风，更高、更快地飞翔吧！（附图片）
