    Machine Tools "Laying Eggs" and "Chicks" Becoming a Crowd
    Ou Yuanfang, Zhou Yizhi
        The Glory of the Pioneer
    Kim Seong-cheon, a worker at the Juul Flax Mill, was concentrating on assembling a universal lathe when he suddenly heard someone push the door open. He turned around and was stunned. Was it Premier Kim Il-sung? While he was still in shock, the Premier and the factory director had already walked up to him.
    The factory director said to the Premier, "This is the first universal lathe our factory has made ourselves."
    The Premier was very pleased. He said, "Oh, you even make lathes!"
    The Premier turned around and called to the Minister of Heavy Industry (Note: The departments of the North Korean Cabinet are called "provinces," and the ministers are called "xiang.") and the Minister of Metallurgical Industry, "Come and see, the workers in this factory can make lathes themselves." The factory director began to recount the process of manufacturing the lathe. After listening, the Premier praised, "Brave workers!" He turned around and held out his hand to Kim Seong-cheon. Kim Seong-cheon's hands were covered in oil, and he didn't dare shake the Premier's hand. But the Premier grabbed his hand and shook it vigorously, saying, "You are a doctor, able to make machine tools yourselves." Then, the Premier said to the ministers accompanying him that the experience of this factory was very good and should be learned from. From that day on, Kim Seong-cheon got the nickname "Doctor." The universal lathe he assembled was also named "Brave."
    When Comrade Zhang Jin-yu, the Party Secretary of the Juul Flax Mill, told us this story, she was like a schoolgirl who had scored a five, unable to suppress her inner joy, and she laughed heartily from time to time. She said that the republic has only this one rope factory. In order to produce more rope to meet the needs of the country's fisheries development, we must expand the factory's equipment. However, after the war, our country suffered severe damage, and construction was underway everywhere. The government must first take care of some key factories and mines. We can't ask the state for everything. We had to grit our teeth, overcome all difficulties, and make our own machine tools to solve our own problems. We only did this little bit of work, and we didn't expect Comrade Premier to give us such a high evaluation.
    After inspecting the Juul Flax Mill on March 13, 1959, Kim Il-sung returned to Pyongyang and suggested to the Central Committee of the Workers' Party to promote the experience of the Juul Flax Mill. In May 1959, the Party Central Committee decided to call on the whole country to launch the "machine tool producing machine tool" movement, requiring all factories, enterprises, and organs to launch mass movements so that each existing machine tool would manufacture more than one new machine tool, ensuring that the country's machine tools would more than double in one year. The Central Committee of the Workers' Party believes that although North Korea's machinery industry has laid a foundation for basically solving the production base of all the machinery and equipment needed by the country, with the rapid development of socialist construction, without expanding and developing the machinery industry, it will not be possible to rapidly increase the people's economy, complete a comprehensive technological revolution, and firmly lay the material and technical foundation of socialism. The "machine tool producing machine tool" movement is the most correct and convenient way for the Party to rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and choose to solve this problem in the specific situation of North Korea.
        Three Broken Lathes
    The reason why the Juul Flax Mill's production of machine tools is particularly valued is because its employees have a strong will to grit their teeth and overcome difficulties and a valuable pioneering spirit. It was this spirit that attracted us to visit this factory.
    Comrade Zhang Jin-yu guided us on a tour. In the machine repair workshop, she pointed to a machine tool and said, "This is the mother, and the dozens around it are its sons." In 1959, the workers of this factory produced forty-four various machine tools. Comrade Zhang Jin-yu told us many interesting stories about producing machine tools.
    In the summer of 1958, they accidentally discovered that there were three broken lathes lying idle in a local ceramics factory, so they sent someone to negotiate. The person in charge of the ceramics factory said, "If you can repair these three lathes, we will give you one." At that time, their desire for lathes was more urgent than a farmer's desire for rain in a drought. They immediately started working day and night for two months, repaired all three lathes, returned two to the ceramics factory, and kept one for themselves.
    Speaking of repairing, almost all the parts on the lathe were replaced. The Flax Mill Party Committee considered that since they could manufacture all the parts themselves, why couldn't they manufacture new lathes? It happened that the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party issued a "red letter" to all party members in September, calling on everyone to break superstitions and dare to think and act. This letter gave the Juul Flax Mill employees great encouragement. They decided to establish their own casting workshop to produce new machine tools. When the first universal lathe they were trial-producing was about to be born, Premier Kim Il-sung came. The Premier's encouragement aroused a new upsurge in the entire factory, and they decided to continue manufacturing lathes in large quantities. The entire factory immediately launched a movement to collect scrap iron and exchanged the lathes they produced with fraternal factories for steel. Later, they discovered a Japanese ship sunk by the Soviet army during World War II in the sea. It was already the end of November, and the sea was as cold as an ice cellar, but the workers still jumped into the sea to dismantle steel plates.
        Five Old Technicians
    Comrade Zhang Jin-yu said that cultivating technical strength is more difficult than solving the problem of materials. Our method is to learn while doing and cultivate talents in practical work. She specifically introduced Comrade Li Bing-dao, the director of the machine repair workshop, to us. When the Juul Flax Mill was brewing to manufacture the first lathe, there were only five technicians in the factory. The Party entrusted technician Li Bing-dao to lead them and be responsible for studying technical issues. They referred to the old lathe and groped to work, and finally manufactured the first lathe. Now, Li Bing-dao can not only cut, but also cast, design, and repair boilers. "He is the treasure of our factory." The young secretary said, laughing happily.
    The Juul Flax Mill Party Committee relied on these five old technicians to solve many complex technical problems and also cultivated a large number of new forces. Now, the machine repair workshop of this factory has 200 technicians, most of whom are new workers. In the past, it took at least five months to train a technician, but now as soon as a worker enters the factory, he is immediately given a lathe, and an old technician is assigned to help them. They can independently process simple parts in just one month.
    When we visited the Juul Flax Mill, the factory had already used the machine tools it produced to repair all the old machines, and it had also newly manufactured a set of linen textile machines, four sets of rope-making machines, two small cranes, and a washing machine... In 1959, the output of rope from the Juul Flax Mill more than doubled compared to 1958. The state originally planned to build a new rope factory, but now it has changed its plan and ordered the Juul Flax Mill to complete the production tasks of two factories by using the machines it manufactures without adding workers.
          New Heights
    We saw a huge lathe at the Longcheng Machine Factory near Hamhung. This lathe weighs more than 300 tons and is as tall as a two-story building. Its cutting table has a diameter of eight meters and twenty centimeters and can process components weighing seventy tons. It is equipped with ten electric motors and is fully automated. This huge lathe was designed and manufactured by the workers of the Longcheng Machine Factory themselves in response to the "machine tool producing machine tool" movement.
    The birth of this nationally renowned eight-meter vertical lathe has a moving experience.
    On March 25, 1959, Kim Il-sung came to the Longcheng Machine Factory for inspection. He told the factory's employees the story of the Juul Flax Mill producing its own machine tools and encouraged them to manufacture an eight-meter vertical lathe.
    The Longcheng Machine Factory accepted this glorious task. However, no one had ever seen such a large lathe before. How to manufacture it? The factory Party Committee immediately organized all the factory employees to participate in the production of this lathe. The South Hamgyong Provincial Party Committee also strongly supported them. A seven-member team headed by the Provincial Party Committee Secretary came to the Longcheng Machine Factory to carry out ideological mobilization and help them work. When engineers and technicians were studying design problems, they encountered many difficulties at the beginning. Technical mystics poured cold water on the workers. An Ba-kyun, a worker in the machine repair workshop, was determined to take on this design task. He disassembled and reassembled the factory's original three-meter vertical lathe, and finally found the trick. The factory Party Committee supported him and established a nine-member design team (including six designers) led by An Ba-kyun. They worked hard for fifty days and drew one hundred and twenty drawings, and finally designed the drawings of the eight-meter vertical lathe.
    The Party Committee seized on this fact and immediately conducted ideological education for the workers. The Democratic Propaganda Office organized workers' amateur literary and art groups, such as Comrade Yu Jae-bok, to collectively create an opera with the theme of manufacturing an eight-meter vertical lathe, using the beautiful song and dance forms of the Korean nation to express the advanced thinking of workers who dare to think and act and the struggle against conservative and backward thinking. The opera publicized the story of Comrade An Ba-kyun and others designing the lathe, and also vividly depicted the various difficulties expected in the manufacturing process and the struggle to overcome them. The factory originally planned to make the eight-meter vertical lathe on November 7, but the opera arranged the completion date of the lathe on the morning of August 14 (the day before the Korean Liberation Day). The opera performed by the workers themselves played a great inspiring role for the factory's employees. They expressed that they must create a new lathe to welcome "August 15" as the opera performed.
    In the process of manufacturing the eight-meter vertical lathe, the workers of the Longcheng Machine Factory gave play to their creativity and solved many complex technical problems. The round table of the lathe weighs thirty-two tons, and the steelmaking furnace in the factory can only make nine tons of steel each time. They used four steelmaking furnaces to make steel at the same time. The diameter of the round table is more than eight meters, and the factory only has a four-meter lathe. They used two cutting tools to cut at the same time. The workers used 250,000 hours of work to manufacture more than 5,900 parts for this lathe.
    The news of the production of the eight-meter vertical lathe spread throughout North Korea. The Longcheng Machine Factory Workers' Amateur Troupe was invited to Pyongyang to perform their opera. Before leaving, the actors made an agreement with the factory workers that they must try to realize the opera's prediction and complete the task in advance on "August 14." On August 14, 1959, the Longcheng Machine Factory Workers' Amateur Troupe actually received a telegram from the factory: "The eight-meter vertical lathe was born this morning!" That night, when the workers were performing here in the theater, earth-shattering cheers rang out on and off the stage. It was not acting in a play, but a real carnival in real life.
    The birth of the eight-meter vertical lathe has taken North Korea's machinery industry a big step forward. With it, North Korean workers can manufacture a series of large-scale machinery and equipment themselves. At the same time, the completion of the eight-meter vertical lathe also marks the leap from quantitative increase to quality improvement in the "machine tool producing machine tool" movement. This victory has greatly promoted the development of the national "machine tool producing machine tool" movement.
        Factory Producing Factory
    During our visit to North Korea, this movement had developed to its climax. Wherever we went, whether it was a province, a county, a factory, or a school, we saw people enthusiastically manufacturing machine tools. The North Korean people picked up the scrap iron scattered everywhere during the war and spent only half a year to produce more than 11,000 machine tools (equivalent to more than 70% of the original machine tools), establishing a huge machine manufacturing industry all over the north. Now, all kinds of factories can manufacture machines and parts for themselves; schools manufacture equipment for their own experimental factories; agricultural cooperatives also use the machine tools sent to them by factories to manufacture small agricultural machines themselves. We not only saw machine tools producing machine tools everywhere, but also saw "factories producing factories."
    At the Huichon Machine Tool Factory, workers are using their spare time to manufacture a large number of machine tools to build a machine tool factory of the same scale as it in Pyongyang. That is to say, they want to produce a factory that produces more than 1,000 modern machine tools a year. The new factory needs 219 machine tools of 30 different forms, 23 of which they have never produced before. At the same time, they are also responsible for producing various modern equipment required by this new factory, including various pipelines and cranes. The machines of the entire new factory weigh 9,000 tons. The workers disassembled various latest machines supplied to the Huichon Machine Tool Factory by fraternal countries for research, simplified electrical equipment, reduced the weight of the lathe, and designed a new type of machine tool that is more convenient to operate without reducing quality. Now, they have sent a batch of universal lathes and surface grinders to the Pyongyang Machine Tool Factory under construction.
    Before liberation, North Korea had no machinery industry at all. In the factories run by Japanese imperialists, Korean workers were not allowed to participate in the installation of machines. During the installation process, the machines were covered with cloth to prevent Korean workers from seeing them. In 1956, North Korea's first self-made machine tool appeared. And today, what a huge change has taken place in this country! After a Japanese mechanical engineer visited the eight-meter vertical lathe at the Longcheng Machine Factory, he said that it would take at least three years to make such a lathe in Japan, but your workers spent five months to manufacture it. The imperialists could not have imagined such an amazing development in North Korea's machinery industry.
    The North Korean people use their own efforts to produce machine tools to expand and improve machinery and equipment, which has a great effect on promoting the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production. Comrade Lim Kye-chol, Chairman of the State Planning Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, told us that the main significance of the "machine tool producing machine tool" movement is that "the people solve their own difficulties themselves." Just like people living their lives, poor people have to think of more ways to live better. Our country is rebuilding on ruins, and many factories have to find their own ways to expand their equipment more quickly. This is how this movement was born and developed vigorously under the leadership of the Party. Now North Korea no longer needs to increase the number of general machine tools, but mainly to improve the utilization rate of existing machine tools, and to reproduce some special-performance machine tools.

    机床“下蛋”“小鸡”成群
    欧远方　周毅之
        首创者的光荣
    朱乙亚麻厂的工人金成天正在聚精会神地装配万能车床，忽然听见有人推门进来，他回头一看，一下子给楞住了，怎么，是金日成首相？他正发楞，首相和厂长已经走到他跟前。
    厂长对首相说：“这是我们厂自己制造的第一台万能车床。”
    首相很高兴，他说：“啊，你们还制造车床！”
    首相回头招呼重工业相（注：朝鲜内阁各部叫“省”，部长叫“相”。）和冶金工业相：“你们来看，这个厂的工人自己会制造车床”。厂长开始讲述制造车床的经过。首相听完称赞道：“勇敢的工人！”他转过身来，把手伸给金成天。金成天满手油污，不敢握首相的手。但是首相一把抓住他的手，使劲地摇，口里说：“你们是博士，能自己制造机床。”接着，首相对随行各相说，这个厂的经验很好，应该向他们学习。从那天起，金成天就得了个“博士”的外号。他所装配的那台万能车床，也被命名为“勇敢号”。
    朱乙亚麻厂的党委员长张锦玉同志给我们讲这段故事的时候，像个考了五分的女学生，压抑不住内心的喜悦，不时发出爽朗的笑声。她说，共和国只有这一个麻绳厂，我们为了多生产麻绳，满足国家发展渔业的需要，必须扩充工厂的设备。但是，战后我们国家遭到惨重的破坏，到处都在进行建设，政府必须首先照顾一些重点厂矿，我们不能什么都伸手向国家要，只好咬紧牙关，克服一切困难，自己动手制造机床，来解决自己的问题。我们就只做了这一点点工作，没想到首相同志竟给予很高的评价。
    金日成首相在1959年3月13日视察了朱乙亚麻厂以后，回到平壤，就向劳动党中央建议，推广朱乙亚麻厂的经验。1959年5月，党中央决定，号召全国开展“机床生产机床”运动，要求所有工厂、企业、机关都展开群众性运动，使现有的每一台机床制造一台以上的新机床，保证全国的工作母机在一年内增加一倍以上。劳动党中央认为，虽然朝鲜的机械工业已经奠定了基本上能够解决本国所需要的一切机械设备的生产基础，但是，随着社会主义建设的突飞猛进，要不扩大和发展机械工业，就不能使人民经济迅速增长，也不能完成全面的技术革命，不能巩固地奠定社会主义的物质及技术基础。“机床生产机床”运动是党依靠群众的积极性和创造性，在朝鲜的具体情况下，选择了解决这一问题的最正确而最近便的道路。
        三台破车床
    朱乙亚麻厂生产机床这件事之所以特别受到重视，是因为它的职工具有咬紧牙关克服困难的坚强意志和可贵的首创精神。正是这种精神吸引我们访问这个工厂。
    张锦玉同志引导我们参观。在机修车间，她指着一台机床说，这是母亲，周围的几十台都是它的儿子。1959年这个厂的工人生产了四十四台各式机床。张锦玉同志给我们讲了许多有关生产机床的有趣故事。
    1956年上级派她到朱乙亚麻厂担任党的领导工作。这个厂原来只有二十多台老掉了牙的麻绳机和三台摇头晃臂的破车床。当时，全厂职工都想努力提高设备利用率，更好地发展生产。但是，工厂的老机器却不大管用，工人有劲使不上。他们成天在想，要是能够增加几台新机床，自己制造零件，赶快补修好旧机器，那该多好啊！
    1958年夏天，他们偶然发现当地的一个陶瓷厂里有三台坏车床摆着没用，就派人去交涉。陶瓷厂的负责人说，你们如果能修好这三台车床，就送给你们一台。当时他们想车床的心情，比农民在大旱的日子里想雨水想的还急。他们立即动手日夜不停地干了两个月，把三台车床都修好，送还陶瓷厂两台，自己留下一台。
    说是修理，实际上，车床上的零件差不多全都换了。亚麻厂党委考虑，既然自己能制造全部零件，那为什么不能制造新车床？刚好那时朝鲜劳动党中央向全体党员发出九月“红信”，号召大家破除迷信，敢想敢干。这封信给朱乙亚麻厂职工很大的鼓舞。他们决定建立自己的铸造车间，生产新机床。当他们试制的第一台万能车床快要诞生的时候，金日成首相来了。首相的鼓励在全厂引起一个新的高潮，他们决定要继续大批制造车床。全厂职工立即展开收集废铁运动，还拿自己生产的车床和兄弟厂换钢材。后来，他们又在海里发现一艘第二次世界大战期间被苏军击沉的日本船。当时已是11月底，海里冷得像冰窖一样，但工人们还是跳下海去拆钢板。
        五个老技工
    张锦玉同志说，培养技术力量比解决材料问题还要困难。我们的办法是一面做，一面学，在实际工作中培养人材。她特地给我们介绍机修车间主任李炳道同志。当朱乙亚麻厂酝酿制造第一台车床的时候，厂里只有五个技术工人，党就委托技工李炳道领导他们，负责研究技术问题。他们参照旧车床摸索着干，终于制造出了第一台车床。现在，李炳道不仅会切削，还会铸造、设计和修理锅炉。“他是我们工厂的宝贝。”这位年轻的委员长说着，高兴得哈哈大笑起来。
    朱乙亚麻厂党委就依靠着这五个老技工，解决了许多复杂的技术问题，还培养了大批新生力量。现在这个厂的机修车间已经有二百个技工，大多数是新工人。过去培养一个技工最少要五个月，现在工人一进厂马上就交给他车床，并指定老技工帮助他们，只要一个月他们就能够独立加工简单的零件。
    当我们访问朱乙亚麻厂的时候，这个厂已经利用自己生产的机床，把所有的老机器都补修了，还新制了一套麻布纺织机、四套制造麻绳的机器、两部小型起重机和一架洗衣机……。1959年，朱乙亚麻厂的麻绳产量，比1958年增加了一倍多。国家原计划增建一座麻绳厂，现在改变了计划，责成朱乙亚麻厂在不增添工人的条件下，利用自己制造的机器，完成两个厂的生产任务。
          新的高峰
    我们在咸兴附近的龙城机器厂看到一台庞大的车床。这台车床重三百多吨，有两层楼那么高。它的切削台直径长八米二十厘米，可以加工七十吨重的部件。它上面安装有十部电动机，操作完全自动化。这台庞大的车床，是龙城机器厂的工人响应“机床生产机床”运动自己设计自己制造的。
    这台名闻全国的八米立式车床的诞生，有一段动人的经历。
    1959年3月25日，金日成首相来龙城机器厂视察。他给这个厂的职工谈朱乙亚麻厂自己生产机床的故事，鼓励他们制造一台八米立式车床。
    龙城机器厂接受了这个光荣任务。但是，过去谁也没有见过这样大的车床，怎样制造呢？工厂党委立即组织全厂职工，参加这部车床的生产。咸镜南道党委也大力支持他们，以道党委委员长为首的七人小组来到龙城机器厂，进行思想动员并帮助他们工作。在工程技术人员研究设计问题时，一开始就遇到许多困难。技术神秘论者向工人群众泼冷水。机修车间工人安八均同志决心担当起这个设计任务。他把厂内原有的三米立式车床拆了再装，装起来又拆，终于找到了门道。工厂党委支持他，成立了九人设计小组（内有六个设计员），由安八均领导。他们苦战五十天，画了一百二十张图纸，终于把八米立式车床的图样设计出来了。
    党委抓住这个事实，立即对工人进行思想教育。民主宣传室组织工人业余文艺小组余载福等同志，集体创作了一个歌剧，以制造八米立式车床为主题，运用朝鲜民族优美的歌舞形式，表现工人敢想敢干的先进思想和保守落后思想的斗争。歌剧宣扬了安八均等同志设计车床的故事，还把预想到的制造过程中的各种困难和克服困难的斗争作了生动的刻画。工厂原定11月7日制成八米立式车床，歌剧却把车床完工的日期安排在8月14日清晨（朝鲜解放纪念日的前一天）。工人自己上演的歌剧，对全厂职工起了很大的鼓舞作用。他们纷纷表示，一定要像歌剧所表演的那样，造成新车床来迎接“八·一五”。
    在制造八米立式车床的过程中，龙城机器厂工人发挥创造性，解决了许多复杂的技术问题。车床的圆台重三十二吨，厂内的炼钢炉每次只能炼九吨钢。他们就用四个炼钢炉同时炼钢。圆台的直径长八米多，厂内只有四米车床，他们用两把车刀同时切削。工人们用二十五万小时的工作量，为这部车床制造了五千九百多个零件。
    生产八米立式车床的消息传遍了全朝鲜。龙城机器厂的工人业余剧团被邀请到平壤演出他们的歌剧。演员们临走时和厂内工人相约，一定要设法争取实现歌剧的预言，提前在“八·一四”完成任务。1959年8月14日，龙城机器厂工人业余剧团果然接到工厂的来电：“八米立式车床今晨诞生了！”那天晚上，当工人在剧场演到这里的时候，台上台下响起震天的欢呼声。那里不是在演剧，而是实际生活中真正的狂欢。
    八米立式车床的诞生，使朝鲜的机械工业又向前迈了一大步。有了它，朝鲜工人就能够自己制造一系列的大型机器设备。同时，八米立式车床的制成，也标志着“机床生产机床”运动从数量增加到质量提高的飞跃。这一胜利大大推动了全国“机床生产机床”运动的发展。
        工厂生产工厂
    我们访问朝鲜期间，这个运动已经发展到最高潮。我们无论走到哪一个道、哪一个郡、哪一个工厂、哪一个学校，都看见人们在兴致勃勃地制造机床。朝鲜人民拣起战时散在各地的废铁，只花了半年工夫，就生产了一万一千多台机床（相当于原有机床70％以上），建立了一个遍布全北部的庞大的机器制造业。现在，各式各样的工厂都可以为自己制造机器和零件；学校自己制造实验工厂的设备；农业社也利用工厂送给它们的机床，自己制造小型农业机器。我们不仅到处看到机床生产机床，还看到了“工厂生产工厂”。
    在熙川机床厂，工人们正在利用业余的时间，制造大批机床，为平壤建设一个跟它同样规模的机床厂。这就是说，他们要生产一个年产一千多台现代化机床的工厂。新厂需要三十种不同形式的机床二百一十九台，其中二十三种是他们从来没有生产过的。同时，他们还要负责生产这个新工厂所需要的各种现代化装备，包括各种管道和起重机等。整个新厂的机器重达九千吨。工人们把兄弟国家供给熙川机床厂的各种最新式机器拆开来研究，简化电气设备，减轻了车床的重量，设计出操作更加方便而又不降低质量的新式机床。现在，他们已经送出一批万能车床和平面磨床给正在建设中的平壤机床厂。
    解放前，朝鲜根本没有机械工业。在日本帝国主义者所办的工厂里，安装机器时，不让朝鲜工人参加，安装过程中用布蒙盖着机器，不让朝鲜工人看。1956年，朝鲜才出现第一台自制的机床。而今天，这个国家已经发生了多么巨大的变化啊！一位日本机械工程师参观了龙城机器厂的八米立式车床后说，你们的工人花五个月的时间制造出这样的车床，在日本最少要三年才能造出来。朝鲜机械工业的这种惊人发展，帝国主义者是做梦也不能想像的。
    朝鲜人民用自力更生的办法生产机床来扩大和改善机械设备，对推动工农业生产的迅速发展，具有很大的作用。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国家计划委员会委员长林桂哲同志告诉我们，“机床生产机床”运动的主要意义是“人民自己解决自己的困难”。就像人们过日子一样，穷人得多想办法，才能生活得更好。我们国家是在废墟上重新恢复建设，许多工厂为了更快地扩充设备，不能不自己想办法。这个运动就是这样产生，并且在党的领导下蓬勃发展起来的。现在朝鲜已经不需要再增加一般机床的数量，主要是提高现有机床的利用率，并且再生产一些特殊性能的机床。
