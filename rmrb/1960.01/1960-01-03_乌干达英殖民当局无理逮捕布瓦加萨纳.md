Xinhua News Agency, December 31st, Kampala Dispatch: Bwagasana, Secretary-General of the Rwandan National Union of Rwanda-Urundi in central Africa, was recently arrested by the British colonial authorities in Uganda and fined one hundred shillings.

The colonial authorities accused him of bringing into Uganda a pamphlet written by John Kaire, Foreign Affairs Secretary of the National Congress of Uganda. These pamphlets were absurdly labeled as "communist propaganda" by the colonial authorities.

    乌干达英殖民当局
    无理逮捕布瓦加萨纳
    据新华社12月31日电　坎帕拉消息：非洲中部卢安达—乌隆迪的卢安达民族联盟总书记布瓦加萨纳最近在乌干达被英国殖民当局逮捕，并被判处一百先令罚款。
    殖民当局指控他带入乌干达国民大会外事秘书约翰·凯耳所编写的一种小册子，这些小册子被殖民当局荒谬地称为“共产主义宣传品”。
