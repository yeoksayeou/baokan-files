    Improvement is Victory
    Zhang Wei
    To seize a flying start, the first thing to rely on is ingenuity. Among our workers, there are countless skilled individuals who drive thousands upon thousands of others to find tricks, tap potential, and seize one victory after another. However, there are also a few people who, when they encounter temporary setbacks in the competition, become discouraged, thinking that they cannot compare to others and have "failed."
    This kind of thinking is detrimental to seizing a flying start.
    The Southern Machinery Repair Factory in Anshan organized many report meetings to pass on knowledge and learn from others during the technical performance competitions and head-to-head contests. One of these was to invite an old worker, who was often defeated in the "head-to-head contest" and therefore known as the "perennial loser," to share his thoughts. Although this old worker lost again and again in the competition, he always participated in competition after competition with great enthusiasm. When asked why he was able to do this, he said: "Although I lost, my skills have improved every time, and my output has increased every time. Why shouldn't I be happy?"
    This old worker's words are completely correct.
    Victory and defeat, winning and losing, are determined through comparison. In head-to-head contests, the common comparison method is between two people. Like playing chess or ball games, one side loses and the other wins.
    But besides this comparison method, there is another comparison method, which is the comparison of the competitor himself before and after the competition. Did the competition improve or lower the competitor compared to before? If it is lowered, of course it is a failure, but if it is improved, this is also a victory.
    We do not oppose striving for first place and encourage winners, but we must also see that the biggest and most fundamental characteristic of our competition movement is common improvement. Improving compared to before the competition is common and widespread, while those who are lowered in the competition can be said to be "extremely rare." Therefore, even if someone loses in a relative sense, in an absolute sense, the loser has not failed, nor has he lost. Everyone wins, and everyone is victorious. The only difference is the degree of victory, whether it is a great victory or a small victory, a big win or a small win. Every competition, even if it is not won, will still enable people to develop their thinking, broaden their horizons, increase their experience, and improve their skills, accumulating certain conditions and foundations for the next victory. Like the old worker who lost again and again in the head-to-head contest, although he failed, he improved every time, and he was still happy, full of energy, and continued his efforts. This kind of determination, perseverance, and spirit of "not being discouraged by failure" and "never giving up" is very valuable. As long as people have this spirit, they will eventually be able to achieve victory.
    In the past, there was a general who lost repeatedly in battle. In his report to his superiors, there was a sentence "a hundred battles, a hundred defeats." Later, he felt that this was a pessimistic and frustrated emotion, so he changed it to "a hundred defeats, a hundred battles." As a result, he achieved victory. This is not only a change in wording, but more importantly, it shows his indomitable perseverance and determination to win the final victory. In fact, in today's labor competitions, failure and victory are like the wheels of a train, seemingly going up and down, but actually moving forward at a rapid pace. We must have a strong determination and confidence to strive for victory and winning. This is just like the steam of a train, which is the driving force to encourage people to move forward. Without this determination and confidence, it would be like a locomotive that has been extinguished, stopping and not moving.

    提高就是胜利
    张葳
    夺开门红，首先靠个巧字。我们的工人中间，有无数能人巧手，他们又带动千千万万人找窍门，挖潜力，夺得一个接一个的胜利。但是，也有少数人，在竞赛里一遇到暂时的落后，就泄气，认为自己比不过别人，“失败了”。
    这种思想情绪，对巧夺开门红是不利的。
    鞍山市南部机修厂在技术表演赛和对手赛中，组织了许多传宝取经的报告会，其中有一项，是请了一个在“对手赛”中经常输给对方，因而被称为“常败将军”的老工人来谈心。这位老工人在竞赛中虽然一败再败，但他总是兴高采烈地一赛再赛。问他为啥能这样，他说：“我虽然输了，可是每次技术都有所提高，产量每次都是增加了，我为啥不高兴呢？”
    这位老工人的话完全正确。
    胜与败，输与赢，是经过比较才比出来的。在对手赛中比较通用的比法是两个人比。就像下棋或打球一样，一方输，一方赢。
    但除了这种比法以外，还有一种比法，即竞赛者本人前后对比。竞赛以后是比以前提高了还是降低了。如果降低了，当然就是失败，如果提高了，这也是一种胜利。
    我们不反对争第一，鼓励优胜者，但是，还必须看到，我们的竞赛运动，最大、最基本的特点，是共同提高。比竞赛前提高了，是普遍的、大量的，而在竞赛中反而降低了的，可以说是“绝无仅有”。因此，在相对意义上输了，而在绝对意义上，失败者也没有失败，也没有输，大家都是赢、都是胜，所不同的，只是大胜或小胜、大赢或小赢而已。每一次竞赛即便是没有赢，也同样会使得人们思想开展，眼界开阔，经验增长，技术提高，为下一次的胜利积累了一定的条件和基础。像那位老工人在对手赛中一败再败一样，虽然失败了，但每次都提高了，而仍兴高采烈，精神饱满，再接再厉。这种有决心，有毅力，“败而不馁”“百折不挠”的精神是十分可贵的。人们只要有这种精神，终将能获得胜利。
    过去有一位将军，屡战屡败，在他给上司的报告中，有一句“百战百败”，后来他感觉到这是一种悲观沮丧情绪，便改为“百败百战”。结果获得胜利。这不仅是文字上的改动，重要的是表现了他的坚韧不拔的毅力和夺取最后胜利的决心。其实，在我们今天的劳动竞赛中，失败与胜利，正像火车的车轮一样，表面看起来一上一下，实际都在飞速地前进。我们必须有坚强的争胜争赢的决心和信心。这也正如火车的蒸汽一样，是鼓舞人们前进的动力，如果没有这种决心和信心，就如熄了火的机车一样，停摆不动了。
