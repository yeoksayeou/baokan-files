To build our great socialist country in a faster, better, and more economical way, we must carry out extensive and profound cultural and technological revolutions and have a strong scientific and technological force. It is becoming increasingly important to build this scientific and technological force as quickly as possible. How do we expand our scientific and technological force? The best and most practical way is to cultivate scientific and technological talent using the method of "walking on two legs."

The great leap forward in socialist construction urgently requires raising the level of science and technology in our country. We must accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture, accelerate the technological transformation of industry and transportation, and eliminate the weak links in the heavy industry sector as soon as possible. However, technology must be mastered by people. In the period of seven to ten years, the country needs to train one million senior and intermediate agricultural technicians, and an even greater number of junior technicians, in order to adapt to the developing situation of agricultural modernization. Preliminary plans in Hebei Province show that by 1962, they will need more than 11,000 senior agricultural technicians and more than 51,000 intermediate agricultural technicians. According to the plan to realize mechanization and electrification, Ye County, Henan Province, estimates that the county will need more than 7,000 agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy technicians in 1960, more than 17,000 technicians in 1961, and 50,000 by 1962. In Haicheng County, Fujian Province, the installation of water pumps, mechanization of fishing, and the establishment of chemical fertilizer plants and rice milling plants alone require more than 11,500 junior and intermediate technical personnel. These situations show that China urgently needs technical talent, and the demand is extremely large. Systematically cultivating scientific and technological talent and continuously meeting the needs of production development are extremely important conditions for ensuring the high-speed development of socialist construction.

Full-time school education is an important method for cultivating technical talent. In the past, full-time schools trained a large number of technical talent and made great contributions to socialist construction. In the future, full-time schools will play an even greater role. However, the tasks undertaken by full-time schools are limited, and it takes a relatively long time, for example, three to five years for universities or secondary specialized schools to train a group of talent. Therefore, relying solely on full-time schools to train technical talent is far from enough to meet the needs of the high-speed development of socialist construction. According to the preliminary plan of the 1960 national economic plan, it is estimated that about 200,000 higher and secondary industrial specialized personnel will be added next year. Excluding the approximately 130,000 graduates expected from higher and secondary industrial schools next year, there will still be a significant shortfall. Within seven to ten years, the country needs one million senior and intermediate agricultural technicians and more junior technicians. At present, there are only 170,000 agricultural technicians in the country. Taking agricultural mechanization as an example, by 1962, the number of senior technical cadres needs to increase by more than 6,000, and the number of intermediate technical cadres needs to increase by more than 15,000 to meet the needs of mechanized farming. However, by 1962, full-time schools can only train more than 4,200 senior technical cadres and more than 7,900 intermediate technical cadres in this area. The problem of cultivating the extremely large number of junior technical personnel will be even more impossible for full-time schools to solve. The situation is very clear that in the cultivation of technical talent, we must also adopt the method of "walking on two legs," that is, under the principles of combining unity and diversity, combining popularization and improvement, and combining central overall planning and local decentralization, in addition to full-time schools undertaking the task of cultivating technical talent, factories, mines, enterprises, government agencies, and people's communes must run various forms of spare-time technical schools, mobilize the enthusiasm of all sectors of society to run schools, and cultivate more technical talent at the fastest speed and with the least amount of funds.

Is it possible to cultivate technical talent using the method of "walking on two legs"? Some people do not immediately recognize this important policy very clearly. They do not understand that the working class and the laboring people of our country have a high degree of socialist consciousness and a strong desire to further master science and technology to change the "poor and blank" face of our country, and many people have already achieved excellent results in the process of learning and mastering advanced technology. This is an important condition for cultivating them into technical talent. If they can be armed with the theoretical knowledge of science and technology in a timely manner, they will surely become technical talent with both practical experience and theoretical knowledge, and make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland. In the past period, whether in factories, mines, enterprises, or people's communes, they have cultivated a large number of personnel who have mastered certain production technologies, as well as junior technical personnel, and a few of them have become experts. Talent emerges in large numbers among the workers and peasants. Apprentices can also become technical talent. Let's see! Gou Wenbin, deputy director of the Chongqing Enamel Factory, was an apprentice when he entered the factory in 1950 and only had elementary school education. Over the years, under the cultivation and education of the Party, he worked hard to study Russian, German, French, and Polish in his spare time. He is now able to read professional materials in Russian and German and has further mastered the science and technology of the enamel industry, solving many major scientific and technological problems. It can be seen that it is not only certain "experts" who can master advanced science and technology. Workers can also become technical talent. Let's see! Yin Zhusheng, director of the workshop of the Hunan Dongpo Nonferrous Metal Mine, was originally a semi-literate repair worker. Through spare-time study, he gradually mastered science and technology. Over the years, he has improved and created more than 50 kinds of tools. The electric rock drill he recently trial-produced has been preliminarily appraised by relevant central departments and is considered a major contribution. It can be seen that it is not only certain "scientists" who can make inventions and creations. Farmers can also become technical talent. Let's see! Zhang Qiuxiang, a female farmer scientist in Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, worked hard to study cotton planting technology and achieved high yields. It can be seen that it is not only specialized schools that can cultivate technical talent. Aren't these excellent examples? Among the working class and the laboring people of our country, there are many, many people who have the confidence and ambition of these people. "Walking on two legs" to cultivate technical talent is precisely to maximize the mobilization of the wisdom and strength of the working class and the laboring people of our country to serve socialist construction. It is in line with the spirit of the Party's general line and is possible and must be done.

Leaders of factories, enterprises, and people's communes must realize that cultivating workers and peasants into technical talent is an important aspect of the intellectualization of the laboring people. Socialist factories and enterprises should not only produce material products, but also cultivate new people of communism. To make every effort to enable advanced producers and even all employees to have a high degree of communist political consciousness and moral character, and also have a high level of science and technology, this is the task of the technological revolution and also the task of the cultural revolution. Not only factories and enterprises should do this, but people's communes also have the responsibility to do so. Combining production and education will definitely be conducive to the development of production. In order to do this work well, each unit should make long-term plans, strengthen leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, and take corresponding effective measures to actively take action. It must be regarded as a major event and be carried out on a large scale.

Factories and enterprises have relatively strong technical forces and can run half-day schools and spare-time schools at all levels. Large factories and mines can also run spare-time universities. The spare-time school of the Tianjin Tractor Factory is doing very well, and many advanced producers are also active in learning. In this way, advanced producers are constantly advancing technologically, and the results are great. Therefore, every factory and enterprise, as long as conditions permit, must do everything possible to run various schools, extensively cultivate technical talent, and focus on advanced producers, giving them more help. If the factories and enterprises do not have enough strength to run schools, they can also jointly run schools with nearby universities. In addition to running their own schools well, higher industrial schools and secondary specialized schools, if conditions permit, should also run spare-time schools, correspondence schools, and night universities to cultivate more advanced producers and veteran workers into technical talent.

People's communes should vigorously cultivate agricultural technical talent and can run junior agricultural technical schools and widely carry out spare-time technical education. The Fenghuo People's Commune in Qian County, Shaanxi Province, through agricultural technical schools and various spare-time schools, has cultivated more than 500 agricultural technicians who have mastered certain scientific and technological knowledge, promoted new technologies, and broken the idea that farmers mastering science is "wanting to pick stars from the sky" and "putting a cage on a flea." Factories, enterprises, and people's communes can all establish various scientific and technological research organizations, absorb technical personnel and advanced producers to participate, conduct scientific and technological activities under leadership, and help advanced producers improve their scientific and technological level. The scientific research小组 organized by the Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant invited technicians from the Municipal Science and Technology Association to participate and study with advanced producers, learning from each other's strengths and better realizing technological innovation. Technical personnel enriched their practical knowledge of production, and advanced producers improved their theoretical knowledge.

Factories, enterprises, and people's communes should take into account the characteristics of technical talent in their training and gradually and systematically improve them. Some are still illiterate, then we must help them learn to read; some have elementary school education, then we must raise them to the middle school level; some have middle school level, then we must raise them to the university level. It must be known that culture is a tool, and if you do not master this tool, it is impossible to capture the scientific fortress. Some people have a low cultural level and cannot understand the lessons. Therefore, we must pay attention to their learning of basic cultural knowledge. The practical production experience of advanced producers and veteran workers is extremely rich. When training them, we should adopt methods different from those of full-time professional schools and pay more attention to bringing their practical experience to the theoretical level and letting them master more theoretical knowledge. When necessary, combined with the study of basic theory, organize them to participate in production internship operations for a certain period of time, especially to conduct experimental teaching for them, and make full use of experimental instruments and materials, which is also very important. Some farmers conduct experiments and understand the properties of the soil, and happily say, "It turns out that there is knowledge in the soil, and now I know." The key to ensuring the quality of technical talent training lies in having enough teachers who are both red and expert. The current source of teachers is insufficient, and all localities should also pay attention to vigorously cultivating them. All localities should also do a good job in compiling teaching materials and use the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods to establish necessary laboratories, etc., to create all necessary conditions for cultivating a large number of scientific and technological talent.

The advanced elements of the working class and the laboring people of our country must make up their minds, have great ambitions, and while excellently completing production tasks, further develop the communist style, break superstitions, dare to think and dare to do, and train themselves to become working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert. People say, "How can you dig a well with one hoe, how can you draw a dragon with one stroke?" We must learn hard and learn honestly. "As long as you work hard enough, an iron rod can be ground into an embroidery needle." A worker said that we should have "Liberation brand thinking, invincible brand determination, and permanent brand drive!" This is a heroic statement with the style of the times. In front of the working class and the laboring people of our country, any difficulty can be overcome, and the scientific fortress can be captured. Advanced producers on all fronts should take the lead in working hard, not only be advanced in thinking and advanced in production, but also improve their technical level day by day. With this spirit of self-reliance and striving for strength, they can make more and greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    用“两条腿走路”的方法培养技术人才
    多快好省地建设我们伟大的社会主义国家，就必须进行广泛的深刻的文化革命和技术革命，必须要有一支强大的科学技术队伍。尽快地建设起这支科学技术队伍，已经愈来愈显得重要了。怎样来壮大我国的科学技术队伍呢？用“两条腿走路”的方法培养科学技术人才，是最好的方法，也是最切实可行的方法。
    社会主义建设大跃进，迫切要求提高我国的科学技术水平。我们必须加速对农业的技术改造，加快对工业、交通运输事业的技术改造，尽快地消除重工业部门的薄弱环节。但是，技术是要依靠人来掌握的。在七年到十年的时期内全国要培养的一百万高级和中级的农业技术人员，和数目更多的初级技术人员，才能适应农业现代化的发展形势。河北省初步规划，到1962年，即需要高级农业技术人员一万一千多人，中级农业技术人员五万一千多人。河南省叶县根据实现机械化、电气化的规划预计，全县在1960年就需要农、林、水利各类技术员七千多人，1961年就需要各类技术员一万七千多人，到1962年即需要五万人。福建省海澄县光是装设抽水机，捕鱼机械化，和建立化学肥料厂、碾米加工厂等工业，就需要一万一千五百多名初级和中级技术人才。这些情况说明，我国需要技术人才最为迫切，需要量也极其巨大。有计划地培养科学技术人才，不断地满足生产发展的需要，是保证社会主义建设高速度发展的极其重要的条件。
    全日制学校教育是培养技术人才的一种重要方法。过去全日制学校培养出大批技术人才，对社会主义建设作出了巨大贡献。今后全日制学校还要更多地发挥它的作用。但是，全日制学校所负担的任务是有一定的限度的，而且要经过比较长的时间，比如说，高等学校或中等专业学校要三年到五年，才能培养出一批人才来。所以，单单依靠全日制学校来培养技术人才，远远不能适应社会主义建设高速度发展的需要。根据1960年国民经济计划的初步方案估计，明年约补充高等和中等工业专门人才二十万人左右，除去明年高等和中等工业学校预计毕业生十三万人左右，还不敷很多。在七年到十年时间内，全国需要一百万高级和中级的农业技术人员和更多的初级技术人员。而现在全国只有农业技术人员十七万人。即以农业机械化来说，到1962年，高级技术干部要增加六千多人，中级技术干部要增加一万五千多人才能满足机械耕作的需要。而到1962年，全日制学校只能培养出这方面的高级技术干部四千二百多人，中级技术干部七千九百多人。而数量至为巨大的初级技术人才的培养问题，将更不是全日制学校所能解决得了的。形势已经很明白，在培养技术人才方面，也必须采取“两条腿走路”的方法，这就是说，在统一性与多样性相结合、普及与提高相结合、中央全面规划与地方分权相结合的原则下，除了全日制学校担负培养技术人才的任务以外，工矿、企业、机关、人民公社都要举办各种形式的业余技术学校，调动社会上各方面办学校的积极性，以最快的速度，用最少的资金，培养更多的技术人才。
    能不能用“两条腿走路”的方法培养技术人才？有些人对于这个重要的方针并不是一下子认识得很清楚的。他们不了解，我国工人阶级和劳动人民有高度的社会主义觉悟，有进一步掌握科学技术来改变我国“一穷二白”面貌的强烈的愿望，而且很多的人已经在学习和掌握先进技术的过程中，取得了优异的成绩。这是能够把他们培养成为技术人才的重要条件。如果能够及时用科学技术的理论知识来武装他们，一定能够使他们成为又有实际经验又有理论知识的技术人才，对祖国的社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。过去一个时期以来，无论工矿、企业、人民公社，都培养了大批的掌握一定生产技术的人才，以及初级技术人才，其中也有少数人成了专家。工农群众中人才辈出，风起云涌。学徒也可以成为技术人才的。我们看吧！重庆搪瓷厂副厂长苟文彬，1950年进厂时是一个学徒，只有小学文化程度，几年来，在党的培养教育下，他刻苦钻研，抓紧业余时间学习俄文、德文、法文、波兰文，现已能够阅读俄文、德文的专业资料，进一步掌握了搪瓷工业科学技术，解决了不少的重大科学技术问题。可以见得，并不是只有某些“专家”才能掌握高深的科学技术的。工人也可以成为技术人才的。我们看吧！湖南东波有色金属矿车间主任尹竹生，原来是个半文盲的修配工人，通过业余学习，逐步掌握科学技术。几年来，他改进和创造了五十多种工具，最近试制的电动凿石机，经中央有关部门初步鉴定，认为这是个大的贡献。可以见得，并不是只有某些“科学家”才能作出发明创造的。农民也可以成为技术人才的。我们看吧！陕西泾阳县的女农民科学家张秋香，刻苦钻研植棉技术，获得了高额丰收。可以见得，并不是只有专门学校才能培养出技术人才来。这些不就是出色的例证吗？我国工人阶级和劳动人民中间，抱有像这些人的信心和志气的人，是很多很多的。“两条腿走路”培养技术人才，正是最大限度地动员了我国工人阶级和劳动人民的智慧和力量，为建设社会主义服务。它是符合于党的总路线的精神的，是可能做到而且必须做到的。
    工厂、企业、人民公社的领导者必须认识到，把工农群众培养成为技术人才，是劳动人民知识化的一个重要方面。社会主义的工矿、企业，不仅要生产物质产品，还要培养共产主义的新人。尽一切努力，使先进生产者以至全体职工，人人都有高度的共产主义政治觉悟和道德品质，又有很高的科学技术水平，这是技术革命的任务，也是文化革命的任务。不仅工矿、企业要这样做，人民公社也有责任这样做。把生产和教育结合起来，一定会有利于生产的发展。为了做好这个工作，各个单位应该做出长远的规划，加强领导，坚持政治挂帅，并且采取相应的有效措施，积极行动起来。一定要把它当作一项大事，大办特办。
    厂矿企业都有比较雄厚的技术力量，可以举办各级的半日制学校和业余学校，大的厂矿还可以举办业余高等学校。天津拖拉机厂的业余学校办得很好，许多先进生产者在学习上也都是积极分子。这样，先进生产者就在技术上不断前进，成效很大。因此，每个厂矿企业，只要有条件的，都要千方百计地举办各种学校，广泛地培养技术人才，并以先进生产者为重点，给他们更多的帮助。如果工厂企业办学校的力量不足，还可以同邻近的高等学校联合举办。高等工业学校和中等专业学校，除了办好本校以外，有条件的，也应该举办业余学校、函授学校、夜大学，来培养更多的先进生产者、老工人成为技术人才。
    人民公社要大力培养农业技术人才，可以举办初级农业技术学校，广泛进行业余技术教育。陕西乾县烽火人民公社，通过农业技术学校和各种业余学校，已经培养出掌握一定科学技术知识的农业技术员五百多人，推广了新技术，打破了认为农民掌握科学是“想上天摘星星”，“给跳蚤套笼头”的思想。工矿企业和人民公社，都可以成立各式各样的科学技术研究组织，吸收技术人员、先进生产者参加，有领导地进行科学技术活动，帮助先进生产者提高科学技术水平。唐山铁厂组织的科学研究小组，就约请市科学技术协会的技术人员参加，同先进生产者一起研究，取长补短，更好地实现技术革新，技术人员丰富了生产实际知识，先进生产者从理论上得到提高。
    工矿企业、人民公社，对于技术人才的培养，要照顾到他们本身的特点，逐步地、有计划地提高他们。有的还是文盲，那就要帮助他们识字；有的有了小学程度，就要把他们提高到中学水平；有的有了中学水平，就要把他们提高到高等学校水平。必须知道，文化是工具，如果不掌握这个工具，是不可能攻占科学堡垒的。有的人文化水平低，上课听不懂。所以，必须重视他们的文化基础知识的学习。先进生产者、老工人的实际生产经验是极其丰富的。在培养他们的时候，就要采用同全日制的专业学校有所不同的方法，要注意更多地把他们的实际经验，提到理论上来，让他们更多地掌握理论知识。在必要的时候，结合基础理论学习，组织他们参加一定过程的生产实习操作，特别是对他们进行实验教学，充分运用实验仪器和材料，也是很重要的。有的农民进行实验，懂得土壤的性能，高兴地说，“原来土壤里还有学问，这下子可知道了。”保证培养技术人才质量的关键，在于有足够的又红又专的师资。现在的师资来源不足，各地也应该注意大力培养。各地还要做好教材编写工作，用土洋结合的办法建立必要的实验室等，为培养大批的科学技术人材创造一切必要的条件。
    我国工人阶级和劳动人民的先进分子，要下决心，立大志，在出色地完成生产任务的同时，进一步发扬共产主义风格，破除迷信，敢想敢做，把自己锻炼成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。人们说：“哪有一锄挖出井，哪有一笔画成龙？”必须艰苦地学，老老实实地学。“只要工夫深，铁杵磨成绣花针”。一个工人说过，我们应该“思想是解放牌，决心是无敌牌，干劲是永久牌！”这是具有时代风格的豪言壮语。在我国工人阶级和劳动人民的面前，任何困难是可以战胜的，科学堡垒是可以攻克的。各个战线的先进生产者应当带头努力，不只思想先进，生产先进，技术水平也要日日提高，有了这种立志图强的精神，才能为祖国的社会主义建设事业作出更多更大的贡献。
