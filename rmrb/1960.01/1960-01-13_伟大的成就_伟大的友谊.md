In November 1959, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, at the invitation of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, sent its delegation to the Soviet Union, carrying the warm congratulations and high respect of the Chinese people, to participate in the grand celebration of the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. During their 21 days in the Soviet Union, the delegation visited the two major cities of Moscow and Leningrad, as well as Tallinn, the capital of the Estonian Republic, Kiev, the capital of the Ukrainian Republic, and Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Republic. We visited many factories, collective farms, schools, museums, and revolutionary historical sites, and had extensive contact with the fraternal Soviet people. Wherever our delegation went, we were received with heartfelt welcome and warm hospitality by the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. At the banquet held by the Soviet government to celebrate the 42nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Comrades Khrushchev, Voroshilov, and Mikoyan met with the leaders of the delegation. During visits and tours in various places, the leading comrades of the party and government in various union republics also warmly received the comrades of the delegation, and had cordial talks with us, introducing us to the brilliant achievements made by the great Soviet people in the cause of building communism, and conveying the Soviet people's deep friendship towards the Chinese people.

1959 was the first year of the Soviet people's implementation of the magnificent program for the comprehensive development of communist construction—the Seven-Year Plan. During this visit, we personally witnessed the great Soviet people, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, full of vigor and high spirits, engaged in creative labor to complete and overfulfill the Seven-Year Plan, and had already achieved great success in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan. This is a great encouragement to the people of socialist countries and the peace-loving and democratic forces of the world, and a heavy blow to the reactionary imperialists.

In 1959, the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, the rate of growth of Soviet industrial production greatly exceeded the average annual growth rate stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan. In the first eleven months of 1959, Soviet industrial production increased by 11.3% compared with the same period in 1958. We could see the flourishing and prosperous scene of Soviet industry everywhere in the Soviet Union. In the first ten months of the Seven-Year Plan, Leningrad had already overfulfilled its industrial output value by 4%, and its labor productivity had increased by 7%. Leningrad is one of the centers of Soviet machine manufacturing, and the automated machine industry and instrument industry are particularly developed. During the Seven-Year Plan, two thousand kinds of machines and instruments will be further improved. A characteristic of Leningrad's large-scale industrial development is that this development is carried out without building new factories and without increasing workers, mainly relying on the improvement of labor productivity and the vigorous implementation of comprehensive mechanization and automation in production. The high-speed development of industry in the Estonian Republic also left a deep impression on us. In Tallinn, we visited the "Volt" electric motor factory, which Comrade Kalinin had worked in as a fitter and which has a long history. Through great efforts in recent years, this factory has increased its daily output to exceed the output of one month in 1940. By the time the Seven-Year Plan is completed, the factory's output will increase by 70% compared with 1958. The Estonian Republic is a relatively young and small republic in the Soviet family, but its development of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishery is amazing. In Estonia's national economy, the leading sector is the shale mining and processing industry. During the Seven-Year Plan, the amount of shale mined there will be nine times higher than in 1939.

During our visits to the Ukrainian and Uzbek Republics, we also saw the vigorous upsurge of the national economy. As early as 1958, the coal output of the Ukrainian Republic reached 164 million tons, pig iron output reached more than 20 million tons, and steel output reached 21.6 million tons; in terms of per capita output of pig iron, iron ore, and white sugar, it had already exceeded the United States. This high-speed development of industry enables the Ukrainian Republic to complete its industrial production Seven-Year Plan one to two years ahead of schedule. The Tashkent Stalin Textile Combine in the Uzbek Republic produced 5.5 million square meters of cloth more than the original annual plan in the ten months of 1959.

Soviet agriculture is also advancing with giant strides. Although the climatic conditions in some areas of the Soviet Union were not good in 1959, the harvest and procurement of grain were still very good, much better than four or five years ago. The state's annual procurement plans for livestock, eggs, and wool were completed ahead of schedule on October 20. The Soviet Union had a bumper harvest of cotton in 1959. The amount of cotton procured reached more than 4.6 million tons, which is unprecedented in Soviet history. We had the opportunity to visit the famous cotton-producing area of the Uzbek Republic this time, which left us with a deep impression. Uzbekistan produced 516,000 tons of cotton in 1913, and planned to produce 2.9 million tons in 1959, but actually produced 3.15 million tons, reaching the level stipulated in the 1960 Seven-Year Plan. The speed of agricultural development in Ukraine is also amazing. Because the disparity in yield per unit area in various regions has been eliminated in recent years, agricultural production can complete the Seven-Year Plan in five years.

An important factor for the Soviet Union's tremendous achievements in economic construction is the technical innovation movement launched by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1959, the technical innovation movement achieved significant results throughout the country. The basic method of the Soviet technical innovation movement at this stage is to promote the comprehensive mechanization and automation of production. Now every factory in the Soviet Union is carrying out activities in this regard. Many factories and mines have reached a high degree of automation. We visited the Khrushchev-named automated bread factory in Moscow, which has reached the level of full automation, producing 200 tons of bread per day, which can supply 700,000 people, but there are very few workers and managers. There are many such bread factories in Moscow and Leningrad. According to Comrade Borodin, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Committee on Automated Machine Manufacturing, ten workshops in the Moscow Automobile Factory are now automated, and in three or four years there will be 170 such workshops, so that all basic workshops will be automated. The degree of automation in other industrial sectors is also increasing rapidly.

The growth of agricultural products is also inseparable from the widespread application of new technologies. In Uzbekistan, the most laborious process in cotton production—cotton picking—has begun to be mechanized. A production innovator who operates a cotton picker can pick ten to twelve tons of cotton a day, equivalent to the work of one hundred to one hundred and twenty skilled manual laborers a day. One Uzbek young woman picked two hundred tons of cotton alone in the short cotton picking season.

The Soviet national economic construction has achieved such great achievements, and also owes to the Soviet people's high labor enthusiasm. In the Soviet Union, the Seven-Year Plan has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the prospect of communist construction inspires everyone. People have become accustomed to linking their careers with the prospect of communism. We saw everywhere in factories and collective farms the workers and peasants saying heroically: "Use our heroic labor to build the communist mansion," "Work, live, and study with the communist spirit." The "Communist Labor Team" movement, which is vigorously developing throughout the Soviet Union, is a clear example of this. The characteristic of this movement is that members of the production team that have won the glorious title of "Communist Labor Team" must not only be able to complete and overfulfill production targets, but also be able to improve their labor skills, enrich their knowledge, and abide by the communist code of conduct. Therefore, this is a movement that marks the entry of socialist competition into a new and higher stage. All the Soviet factories we went to were vigorously carrying out this movement. Seventy-seven work teams in the Stalin Textile Combine in Tashkent are striving to become "Communist Labor Teams," and almost all workers are participating in this competition. In the "Red Excavator" factory in Kiev, nine work teams and two work sections out of more than 2,000 workers in the factory have won the title of "Communist Labor Team."

The Soviet people's high communist labor enthusiasm and the vigorous development of the technical innovation movement make people have reason to be confident that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for developing the national economy can not only be completed, but will also be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled. And everyone understands how important the completion of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is for the final victory of socialism over capitalism!

Throughout the visit, we always felt the deep friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. From the first day we stepped into the Soviet land, we were immersed in fraternal friendship every day, as if we were reunited with our own brothers in our own home.

The friendship of the Soviet people is first manifested in their deep concern for our socialist cause. Whether it is the Soviet party and government leaders or ordinary industrial and agricultural workers, in their conversations with us, they are all rejoicing for the glorious achievements made by the Chinese people in the construction of the national economy under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. They said in unison that the achievements of the great Chinese people are their achievements, and they are proud of the achievements of the Chinese people.

The Soviet people celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country as their own festival. The celebrations in October 1959 concentratedly demonstrated the Soviet people's deep friendship towards the Chinese people. We learned during our visit to the Moscow Power Institute that in order to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country, the teachers and students of the entire institute had made preparations long ago. From the end of September to October 31, they carried out various forms of celebration and publicity activities for a whole month. On October 1, as soon as the class started, the first program was for Soviet teachers and students to congratulate and send gifts to Chinese students. On October 2, they held a school-wide celebration meeting, and in various halls of the school, they held various forms of celebration activities for China's National Day, such as report meetings, symposiums, song festivals, dance festivals, and exhibition rooms. The Power Institute also organized Chinese students to make 300 reports in Moscow factories and suburban farms, with more than 20,000 working people listening to the lectures. In Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, celebrations for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China were also widely carried out. Since there were no Chinese people there, Chinese students were specially invited from Leningrad to give reports.

During our visits to factories or collective farms, Soviet workers and collective farm members showed fraternal enthusiasm for our arrival. They believed that the arrival of representatives of New China in their factories and collective farms was a great encouragement. When we visited the "May 1st" Collective Farm in Kiev, the district committee secretary rushed to accompany us in the heavy snow, introducing us to the situation. Members of the Sverdlov Collective Farm in Uzbekistan also said to us: "We have not been to China, but we are equal to being in China, because we have seen Chinese comrades, and we can talk and eat with Chinese comrades, and learn about New China from you."

In addition to adults, Soviet children also expressed their friendship in their innocent and simple ways, leaving us with unforgettable impressions. When the delegation visited the Zhdanov Young Pioneer Palace in Leningrad, groups of children surrounded us, shook our hands, sang and danced, and welcomed the Chinese uncles and aunts. On November 15, on our way from Tallinn to Kiev, we made a short stop in Riga, the capital of the Latvian Republic. At the airport, we met a six-year-old boy who said to us in Chinese: "You are Chinese, I am Soviet. Long live Sino-Soviet friendship! Long live Chairman Mao! The East Wind prevails over the West Wind!" What a good child! What a good understanding and what deep friendship!

In Tashkent, we visited the Chinese language class of the 59th Middle School, where 450 children are learning Chinese. When we visited the school, the children greeted us in Chinese. It can be seen that Sino-Soviet friendship has taken deep root in the hearts of Soviet children.

Here, we must point out that the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association and their branches and grassroots organizations in various union republics have made outstanding efforts in the noble work of enhancing the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Many of the above-mentioned collective friendly activities were carried out under the organization of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association branch. We once participated in the founding meeting of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association branch of the Tallinn Virde Normal College. From there, we saw how enthusiastically and actively Soviet friends are working to consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship.

During the delegation's visit to the Soviet Union, in order to further promote the development and strengthening of the unbreakable friendship and fraternal cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Union of the Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the representatives of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association signed a cooperation agreement in Moscow. The agreement stipulates the principles and major measures for further cooperation between the two parties. We are convinced that the signing of this agreement will play a significant role in strengthening the ties between the two associations, exchanging experiences, and further developing and consolidating Sino-Soviet friendship.

Consolidating and developing the friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and consolidating and developing the friendship and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, is our country's noble international responsibility. Comrade Mao Zedong said ten years ago: "The unity of the people of the two great countries, China and the Soviet Union, will be permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate them. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great countries, China and the Soviet Union, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of world peace and justice." This brilliant thesis of Chairman Mao has increasingly proved the correctness of his foresight as time goes by. The imperialists and their running dogs have always hated the great friendship and unity between China and the Soviet Union, and they have tried every means to undermine this friendship and unity. Especially recently, when the East Wind has further prevailed over the West Wind, and our situation is getting better and better and the enemy is getting rotten and rotten, they have become more frantic and insidious in provoking and undermining the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. However, the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and the friendly unity of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, will only be strengthened and consolidated day by day, and the despicable tricks of the imperialists will only suffer a shameful failure.

Our delegation came to the Soviet Union with the deep friendship of the Chinese people for the Soviet people, and now we are returning to our motherland with the deep friendship of the Soviet people for the Chinese people. We are convinced that this visit of the delegation will help further develop and consolidate the unity and friendship between our two peoples.

Let us heartily congratulate the great Soviet people on achieving more brilliant achievements in the noble cause of building communism, congratulate the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union on being more consolidated and united, and congratulate the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union for lasting forever!

    伟大的成就  伟大的友谊
    中苏友好协会访苏代表团团长  钱俊瑞  副团长  刘述周
    1959年11月间，中苏友好协会应苏联对外友好和文化联系协会联合会和苏中友好协会的邀请，派遣自己的代表团带着中国人民的热烈祝贺和崇高敬意，到苏联参加了伟大十月社会主义革命四十二周年的盛典。在苏联的二十一天中，代表团访问了莫斯科、列宁格勒两大城市，还访问了爱沙尼亚共和国的首都塔林、乌克兰共和国的首都基辅和乌兹别克共和国的首都塔什干。我们参观了不少工厂、农庄、学校、博物馆和革命史迹，并同兄弟般的苏联人民进行了广泛的接触。我们代表团所到之处，受到苏联各族人民衷心的欢迎和热情的款待。在苏联政府举行的庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十二周年的宴会上，赫鲁晓夫同志和伏罗希洛夫同志、米高扬同志一起接见了代表团的负责人。在各地参观访问期间，各加盟共和国的党政领导同志也热情地接见了代表团的同志们，并且和我们进行了亲切的谈话，向我们介绍了伟大的苏联人民在建设共产主义的事业中所取得的辉煌成就，转达了苏联人民对中国人民的深厚的友谊。
    1959年是苏联人民执行全面开展共产主义建设的宏伟纲领——七年计划的第一年。我们在这次访问中，亲眼看到了伟大的苏联人民在光荣的苏联共产党的领导下，意气风发，精神昂扬，为完成和超额完成七年计划进行着创造性的劳动，并且已经在七年计划的第一年里取得了巨大的成就。这是对社会主义各国人民和全世界和平民主力量的一个巨大鼓舞，是对帝国主义反动派的沉重打击。
    在1959年，七年计划的第一年，苏联工业生产增长的速度大大超过了七年计划所规定的每年平均增长速度。1959年头十一个月苏联工业生产比1958年同期增长了11．3％。苏联工业蓬勃发展、欣欣向荣的景象，我们在苏联随处可以看到。列宁格勒在七年计划的头十个月里，工业产值已超额完成4％，劳动生产率已提高7％。列宁格勒是苏联机器制造业的中心之一，自动化机器工业、仪器工业特别发达。在七年计划里将有二千种机器仪表更加完善。列宁格勒大规模发展工业的一个特点是，这种发展是在不新建厂房、不增加工人的前提下来进行的，这主要是依靠劳动生产率的提高和生产上大力推行全盘机械化和自动化。爱沙尼亚共和国工业的高速度发展也给我们留下了深刻的印象。在塔林，我们访问了一家加里宁同志曾在那里当过钳工的、历史悠久的“伏特”电动机工厂。这个工厂近年来经过巨大的努力，已经使一天的产量超过1940年一个月的产量。这个工厂到七年计划完成时，产量将比1958年增加70％。爱沙尼亚共和国在苏维埃大家庭中是比较年轻、面积较小的一个共和国，但是它的工业、农业、畜牧业、渔业的发展都是惊人的。在爱沙尼亚的国民经济中，主导部门是页岩开采和加工工业。在七年计划期间，那里的页岩开采量将比1939年提高九倍。
    我们在访问乌克兰和乌兹别克共和国的时候，同样看到国民经济的蓬勃高涨。早在1958年，乌克兰共和国的煤产量已达一亿六千四百万吨，生铁产量达二千多万吨，钢产量达二千一百六十万吨；在按人口计算的生铁、铁矿石和白糖的产量方面，已经超过了美国。工业的这种高速度的发展，使得乌克兰共和国可以提前一年至二年完成工业生产的七年计划。乌兹别克共和国的塔什干斯大林纺织联合工厂，1959年十个月的生产已比原定一年计划多生产了五百五十万平方米的布。
    苏联的农业也以巨人的步伐在向前迈进。尽管1959年苏联某些地区的气候条件不好，但是粮食的收获和采购情况还是很好，比四、五年前要好得多。国家对牲畜、蛋品、羊毛的年度采购计划已提前在10月20日完成。1959年苏联的棉花得到了大丰收。棉花采购额达到四百六十多万吨，这在苏联历史上是空前的。我们这一次有机会访问了著名的产棉地乌兹别克共和国，给我们留下了深刻的印象。乌兹别克在1913年年产棉花五十一万六千吨，1959年计划生产二百九十万吨，但是实际生产了三百一十五万吨，达到了七年计划中规定的1960年的水平。乌克兰农业的发展速度也是惊人的。由于近几年来消除了各地在单位面积产量方面的悬殊状况，使得农业生产可以在五年内完成七年计划。
    苏联之所以在经济建设上取得这样巨大的成就，有一个重要的因素，就是苏联共产党号召开展的技术革新运动。1959年，技术革新运动在全国范围内取得了重大成就。现阶段苏联技术革新运动的基本方法是推行生产的全盘机械化和自动化。现在苏联每家工厂都在展开这方面的活动。许多厂矿的自动化程度已经很高。我们在莫斯科参观过以赫鲁晓夫命名的自动化面包工厂，这个工厂已经达到了全面自动化的水平，日产面包二百吨，可以供应七十万人食用，但工人和管理人员却很少。像这样的面包工厂，莫斯科和列宁格勒各有好多个。据苏联自动化机器制造委员会副主席鲍洛金同志告诉我们，现在莫斯科汽车制造厂已有十个车间自动化，三、四年后这样的车间将达到一百七十个，这样，所有基本的车间就都自动化了其他工业部门的自动化程度也在迅速增长。
    农产品的增长，也是同广泛推行新技术分不开的。在乌兹别克斯坦，棉花生产中最繁重的一项工序——摘棉花，已经开始机械化。那里一位操纵摘棉机的生产革新者，一天能收摘棉花十吨到十二吨，相当于一百个到一百二十个熟练的手工劳动者一天的工作量。有一位乌兹别克女青年，在短短的收棉季节里，一个人就收摘了二百吨棉花。
    苏联国民经济建设获得这样巨大的成就，还要归功于苏联人民的高度的劳动热情。在苏联，七年计划已经深入人心，共产主义建设的前景鼓舞着每一个人，人们已经习惯于把自己的事业同共产主义前景联系在一起。我们在工厂和集体农庄里，处处都看见工人农民们这样的豪言壮语：“用我们的英勇劳动来建设共产主义大厦”，“用共产主义精神来工作、生活和学习”。目前在全苏联澎湃开展的“共产主义劳动队”运动就是这方面的明显例子。这个运动的特点是，获得“共产主义劳动队”这个光荣称号的生产队的成员，不仅要能完成和超额完成生产指标，而且要能够提高自己劳动的能力，丰富自己的知识，遵守共产主义的生活准则。因此，这是一个标志着社会主义竞赛进入新的更高的阶段的运动。我们所到的苏联各个工厂，都在热火朝天地开展这种运动。塔什干的斯大林纺织联合工厂有七十七个工作队在争取成为“共产主义劳动队”，几乎所有的工人都参加了这个竞赛。基辅的“红色掘土机”工厂，全厂二千多工人中，已经有九个工作队、两个工作段荣获了“共产主义劳动队”的称号。
    苏联人民这种高度的共产主义劳动热忱和蓬勃开展的技术革新运动，使人们有根据地确信，苏联发展国民经济的七年计划不仅可以完成，而且必将提前和超额完成。而谁都明白，苏联七年计划的完成，对于社会主义最终战胜资本主义具有何等重大的意义！
    在整个访问期间，我们始终感受到苏联人民对中国人民的深情厚谊。从踏进苏联土地的第一天起，我们每天浸沉在兄弟般的友情中，如同在自己家里同亲兄弟团聚一样。
    苏联人民的友谊首先表现在对我国社会主义事业的深切关心。无论苏联的党政负责人，还是普通的工业和农业劳动者，他们在同我们的谈话中，都为我国人民在中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志领导下，在国民经济建设中所取得的辉煌成就而欢欣鼓舞。他们异口同声地说，伟大中国人民的成就就是他们的成就，他们为中国人民的成就而感到自豪。
    苏联人民把我国建国十周年当作自己的节日来庆祝。1959年10月的庆祝活动，集中地表现了苏联人民对中国人民的深厚友谊。我们在访问莫斯科动力学院时得知，为了庆祝我国建国十周年，全院师生在很早以前就作了准备，从9月底到10月31日的整整一个月中，他们开展了各种形式的庆祝和宣传活动。在10月1日这一天，上课一开始，第一项节目就是苏联师生给中国留学生祝贺和送礼。10月2日，他们开了全校的庆祝大会，在学校的各个大厅里，为中国的国庆举行了各种形式的庆祝活动，如报告会、座谈会、歌咏会、舞蹈会、展览室等。动力学院还组织中国留学生在莫斯科的工厂和郊区的农庄作了三百次的报告，听讲的劳动人民有二万多人。在爱沙尼亚首都塔林，也广泛地开展了中华人民共和国成立十周年的庆祝活动，由于当地没有中国人，还特地从列宁格勒邀请了中国的留学生去作报告。
    我们在访问工厂或农庄时，苏联工人和集体农庄的庄员们对我们的来临表现了兄弟般的热忱，他们认为新中国的代表来到了他们的工厂和农庄是个极大的鼓舞。我们在基辅的“五一”集体农庄参观时，区委书记冒着大雪赶来，陪着我们，向我们介绍情况。乌兹别克斯坦斯维尔德洛夫集体农庄的庄员对我们也说：“我们没有到过中国，但是我们等于到了中国，因为我们看到了中国同志，能够同中国同志一起谈话，一起吃饭，从你们身上了解了新中国。”
    除了成人以外，苏联的儿童也用他们天真纯朴的方式表达了自己的友情，给我们留下了难忘的印象。当代表团在列宁格勒日丹诺夫少先宫参观的时候，成群的孩子把我们包围起来，握着我们的手，载歌载舞，欢迎中国的叔叔阿姨们。11月15日，在我们离开塔林前往基辅的途中，我们曾在拉脱维亚共和国的首都里加作了短时间的停留，在飞机场上，我们遇见了一个六岁的男孩子，他用中文向我们说：“你是中国人，我是苏联人。中苏友好万岁！毛主席万岁！东风压倒西风！”多么好的小朋友啊！多么好的理解和多么深的友谊啊！
    在塔什干，我们参观了第五十九中学的中文学习班，那里有四百五十名孩子正在学习中文。当我们在学校参观的时候，孩子们用中国话向我们问好。由此可见，中苏友好已经在苏联孩子们的心灵里深深扎下了根。
    在这里，我们必须指出，苏联对外友好和文化联系协会联合会和苏中友好协会以及它们在各加盟共和国的分会和基层组织，在增进中苏两国人民伟大友谊的崇高工作中作了卓越的努力。上述许多集体性的友好活动，都是在苏中友好协会分会的组织下进行的。我们曾经参加了塔林市维里德师范学院的苏中友好协会分会的成立大会，从那里我们看到了苏联朋友们是如何热情地积极地为巩固中苏友谊而努力。
    在代表团访苏期间，为了进一步促进中苏两国人民之间牢不可破的友谊和兄弟般合作的发展和加强，中苏友好协会和苏联对外友好和文化联系协会联合会、苏中友好协会的代表在莫斯科签订了双方的合作协定。协定规定了双方进一步合作的原则和重大措施。我们深信这个协定的签订，对于两个协会之间加强联系、交流经验以及进一步发展和巩固中苏友谊，将要发生重大的作用。
    巩固和发展中苏两国人民之间的友谊和团结，巩固和发展以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的友好和团结，是我国人民的崇高的国际责任。毛泽东同志在十年以前就说过：“中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利”。毛主席的这个英明论断，随着时间的推移，越来越证明他预见的正确。帝国主义者和他们的走狗从来仇视中苏两国的伟大友谊和团结，他们千方百计地妄图破坏这种友谊和团结。特别在最近，当东风更进一步地压倒西风，我们的境况越来越好，敌人越来越烂的时候，他们便越加疯狂和阴险地来挑拨和破坏中苏两国的友好合作。但是，建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上的中苏两国的友好团结，以及以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的友好团结，只会日益加强和巩固，帝国主义者的卑鄙的伎俩只会遭到可耻的失败。
    我们的代表团带着中国人民对苏联人民的深厚友谊到了苏联，现在又带着苏联人民对中国人民的深厚友谊回到我们的祖国。我们深信，代表团的这次访问，必将有助于我们两国人民之间的团结友好的进一步发展和巩固。
    让我们衷心地祝贺伟大的苏联人民在建设共产主义的崇高事业中获得更加辉煌的成就，祝贺以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加巩固和团结，祝贺中苏两国人民的永恒的牢不可破的友谊万古常青！
