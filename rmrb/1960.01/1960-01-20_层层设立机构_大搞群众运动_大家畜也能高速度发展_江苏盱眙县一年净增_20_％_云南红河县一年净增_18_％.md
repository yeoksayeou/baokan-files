　　Setting up institutions at all levels and carrying out mass movements
　　Livestock can also develop at high speed
　　Xuyi County, Jiangsu Province, achieves a net increase of 20% in one year; Honghe County, Yunnan Province, achieves a net increase of 18% in one year.
　　(Our report) Xuyi County, Jiangsu Province, has achieved great success in developing draught animal husbandry in the past two years. In 1958, the county achieved "four comprehensives" for draught cattle (comprehensive breeding, comprehensive conception, comprehensive calving, and comprehensive survival); in 1959, it achieved "double fulls" (full pregnancy, full fatness) and "six comprehensives" (the four comprehensives plus comprehensive health and comprehensive superior breeds). In the past two years, a total of 8,515 draught cattle have been bred, with a net increase of 11% in 1958 and 20% in 1959.
　　Xuyi County is a semi-hilly and semi-mountainous area with few people and abundant land, with vast land and abundant water and grass, possessing superior natural conditions for developing draught animal husbandry. However, it is only in the past two years that draught animal husbandry has achieved high-speed development. This is primarily due to putting politics in command and vigorously grasping the breeding and reproduction of draught animals. The county party committee and the commune party committees each have a secretary in charge of animal husbandry production, and the production brigades all have animal husbandry committees, led by the branch secretary and with a deputy captain in charge. The county, commune, brigade, and team levels have established a line of organization, and the entire county has formed a leading backbone force of more than 1,000 people for animal husbandry production.
　　In terms of feeding management, Xuyi County has a complete set of systems. For example, it has implemented the "six fixings and three guarantees" system and the "three-in-one" contract, and has universally established draught cattle file cards. The "six fixings and three guarantees" are fixing people, fixing feed, fixing fatness, fixing manure, fixing survival, and fixing work points, guaranteeing feeding, guaranteeing use, and guaranteeing breeding; the content of the "three-in-one" contract is: the feeder is responsible for guaranteeing feeding and breeding, inspecting and deploying use, and reporting and treating cattle diseases; the operator is responsible for guaranteeing use and pregnancy, and inspecting the management and use of draught cattle; the veterinarian is responsible for the health care of draught cattle, seasonal epidemic prevention, inspecting cattle fatness and breeding, and providing technical guidance. The implementation of these systems has greatly strengthened the sense of responsibility of feeders, operators, and veterinarians for the maintenance of draught cattle.
　　The great development of draught cattle has provided more power for agriculture. In 1956, each draught cattle in the county burdened 76 mu of land, taking two months to complete the autumn harvest and autumn planting, the plowing depth was only two or three inches, and transportation mainly relied on manual labor, occupying a lot of labor. After two years of great development, each cattle now only burdens 50 mu of land, the area of the autumn harvest and autumn planting in 1959 has expanded by nearly one time, and the task was completed in one month (of course, the unified planning and reasonable arrangement of labor by the people's commune is also an important reason), the plowing depth has reached more than six inches, and more than 4,000 draught cattle have been freed up to transport fertilizer and grain, saving more than 11,000 manual laborers compared to the past.
　　In order to develop draught cattle at a higher speed, Xuyi County plans to build two more state-owned draught cattle breeding farms in 1960, and each of the eleven communes will build a draught cattle breeding farm, striving to achieve a net increase of 23% in draught cattle throughout the year. At the same time, on the basis of the great development of draught cattle, with pigs and cattle as the center, the goal is to realize two pigs per person, driving the high-speed and comprehensive development of the entire animal husbandry industry.
　　(Our report) The number of large livestock in Honghe County, Yunnan Province, increased by 18% in 1959.
　　In one year, the number of large livestock in Honghe County increased from 21,184 to 25,172, becoming a model for the high-speed development of large livestock in the province. Among them, the net increase of yellow cattle was 928, the net increase of water buffalo was 2,022, and the net increase of mules and horses was 879. Due to the high-speed development of large livestock, a large amount of high-quality fertilizer and animal power has been added, which has vigorously promoted the greater development of agricultural production. Last year, the county's grain output increased by another 16.66% on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958.
　　Honghe County has fertile land, mild climate, lush water and grass, and vast pastures, making it a good place for both agriculture and animal husbandry. In order to achieve continuous leap forward on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958 and achieve a double harvest of grain and livestock, at the beginning of last year, the Honghe County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to the people of the county to develop animal husbandry at high speed, which was enthusiastically supported by the people of the county. The county party committee, led by the first secretary, established the Animal Husbandry and Poultry Production Committee, established specialized institutions at all levels, and strengthened the leadership of animal husbandry production. The county party committee also repeatedly publicized the great significance of vigorously developing animal husbandry for promoting agriculture and the entire national economy, as well as consolidating the people's communes, increasing meat consumption, and improving the people's lives through various meetings. Combining the method of recollection and comparison, through the specific examples of the local area, the six major benefits of vigorously developing animal husbandry were summarized: more fertilizer, more animal power, more grain, more sales to the state, more meat, and more income. The Tuanjie Commune compared two production teams with the same geographical conditions: one is the Luo'e Production Team, which has more than 300 mu of land and 130 large livestock. Because there are many livestock, an average of more than 5,000 jin of livestock fertilizer is applied per mu of land, all of which is done with three plows and three harrows, and the average yield is 800 jin of rice per mu; the Songhe Production Team has 515 mu of land and only 11 large livestock. Therefore, there is a lack of animal power and less barnyard manure is applied, and the average yield per mu is only more than 600 jin. This comparison made the commune members deeply appreciate the great significance of giving equal importance to grain and livestock.
　　On the basis of the ideological improvement of the broad masses, the county party committee timely put forward the fighting slogan of "try every possible means to achieve full breeding and pregnancy, strive for a double harvest of grain and livestock, and realize one large livestock for every five mu of land"; and held on-site meetings in the Jiayin and Lao Bozai communes to exchange the experience of these two communes in using drugs to induce estrus and achieve full breeding and pregnancy of female livestock.
　　After the on-site meeting, a mass movement to develop large livestock at high speed quickly unfolded vigorously throughout the county. In just three months, the communes throughout the county built more than 2,000 livestock pens, achieving pens for every livestock in the county. In order to further promote the in-depth development of the movement, the county party committee launched a comparison and competition within the county, commended the advanced, and ensured that the movement advanced wave after wave.

    层层设立机构　大搞群众运动
    大家畜也能高速度发展
    江苏盱眙县一年净增20％　云南红河县一年净增18％
    本报讯　江苏省盱眙县近两年来在发展耕畜事业上取得了巨大成绩。1958年全县实现了耕牛“四全”（全配种、全受胎、全产仔、全成活）；1959年又实现了耕牛“双满”（满怀、满膘）、“六全”（四全加上全健壮、全良种）。两年来共繁殖耕牛八千五百十五头，1958年净增11％，1959年净增20％。
    盱眙县是个人少地多的半丘陵半山区，土地广阔，水草丰富，发展耕畜具有优越的自然条件。但是，只有近两年来耕畜才得到高速度的发展。这首先是由于政治挂帅，大抓特抓耕畜的配种繁殖工作。县委和公社党委都有一个书记专管畜牧生产，生产大队都有畜牧委员会，由支部书记挂帅、由一个副队长专管。县、公社、大队、小队层层建立一条线的组织，全县组成了一支一千余人的畜牧生产领导骨干。
    在饲养管理上，盱眙县有一套完整的制度。例如推行了“六定三包”制度和“三合一”合同，并且普遍建立耕牛档案卡片。“六定三包”是定人、定料、定膘、定粪、定活、定工分，包喂养、包使用、包繁殖；“三合一”合同的内容是：饲养员负责包养包配，检查调配使用，耕牛有病报告治疗；使役员负责包用、保胎，检查耕牛管理使用情况；兽医负责耕牛的卫生保健，按季防疫，检查牛膘和配种繁殖，并作技术指导。实行这些制度，大大加强了饲养员、使役员和兽医对于保养耕牛的责任心。
    耕牛的大发展，为农业提供了更多的动力。1956年全县每头耕牛负担七十六亩地，秋收秋种两个月才完成，耕地深度只有二、三寸，运输主要靠肩挑，占用很多劳力。经过两年的大发展，现在每头牛只负担五十亩地，1959年秋收秋种面积扩大将近一倍，一个月就完成了任务（当然人民公社统一规划合理安排劳动力也是重要原因），耕地深度已达到六寸以上，并且腾出了四千多头耕畜运肥运粮，比过去节省出一万一千多个肩挑劳力。
    为了用更高速度发展耕畜，盱眙县规划在1960年再兴建国营耕畜繁殖场两座，十一个公社各建一个耕畜繁殖场，力争全年耕牛净增23％。同时，在耕牛大发展的基础上以猪牛为中心，实现一人两头猪，带动整个畜牧事业高速度的全面发展。
    本报讯　云南红河县大牲畜在1959年净增18％。
    一年来红河县的大牲畜由二万一千一百八十四头发展到二万五千一百七十二头，成为全省高速度发展大牲畜的模范。其中黄牛净增九百二十八头，水牛净增二千零二十二头，骡马净增八百七十九头。由于大牲畜的高速度发展，增加了大量优质肥料和畜力，有力地促进了农业生产的更大发展。去年，全县的粮食产量在1958年大跃进的基础上又增长了16．66％。
    红河县土地肥沃，气候温和，水草茂盛，牧场广阔，是个宜农宜牧的好地方。为了在1958年大跃进的基础上实现继续跃进，获得粮畜双丰收，去年年初，中共红河县委向全县人民发出了高速度发展畜牧业的号召，得到了全县人民的热烈拥护。县委由第一书记挂帅，成立畜牧业家禽生产委员会，层层建立专门机构，加强对畜牧业生产的领导。县委还通过各种会议，反复宣传大力发展畜牧业对于促进农业和整个国民经济以及巩固人民公社、增加肉食、改善群众生活的重要意义。结合回忆对比的办法，通过本地的具体事例，总结出大力发展畜牧业的六大好处：肥料多、畜力多、粮食多、出售给国家的多、肉食多、收入多。团结公社对比了两个地理条件相同的生产队：一个是罗额生产队，全队共有三百多亩田地，有大牲畜一百三十头，由于牲畜多，每亩田平均施牲畜肥五千多斤，全部作到三犁三耙，每亩平均收获八百斤稻谷；嵩河底生产队共有五百一十五亩田地，只有大牲畜十一头，因此畜力缺乏，厩肥施的少，平均每亩产量只有六百多斤。这一对比，使社员深刻地体会到粮畜并举的重大意义。
    在广大群众思想提高的基础上，县委又及时地提出“想尽千方百计，满配满怀，力争粮畜双丰收，实现每五亩田一头大牲畜”的战斗口号；并在甲寅和老博寨两个公社召开了现场会，交流这两个社用药物催情，使母畜满配满怀的经验。
    现场会议以后，一个高速度发展大牲畜的群众运动很快就在全县范围内蓬勃展开。全县各公社在短短的三个月内，就修建起了二千多个畜厩，做到了全县头头牲畜有厩。为了进一步促进运动的深入发展，县委又在全县范围内开展了评比竞赛，表扬先进，保证了运动一浪高一浪地前进。
