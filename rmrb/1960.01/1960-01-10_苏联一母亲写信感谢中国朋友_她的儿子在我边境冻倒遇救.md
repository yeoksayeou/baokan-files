Xinhua News Agency, Chita, 8th dispatch (TASS, Chita, 7th dispatch): The Soviet "Transbaikal Worker" newspaper published on the 7th a letter from Alexandra Kubaleva of Makarovo Village, Shirkinsky District, in which she expressed her warm gratitude to the Chinese friends who saved her son's life.

Her son, Boris Kubalev, was herding a group of livestock for a collective farm near the Chinese border. Suddenly, a blizzard struck, and he did not leave the livestock for four days. Finally, he lost his way and wandered into the territory of the People's Republic of China, where he was exhausted and collapsed on the ground, frozen. The Chinese comrades immediately rescued him and sent him to the hospital. After he recovered his health, they sent him back to his country.

Kubaleva wrote, "I don't know who these Chinese people who saved my son are, but their behavior is the behavior of true friends."

    她的儿子在我边境冻倒遇救
    新华社8日讯　塔斯社赤塔7日讯：苏联“外贝加尔工人报”7日刊登了亚历山德拉·库巴列娃自什尔金区马卡罗沃村寄来的一封信，她在信中表示热烈感谢中国朋友救活了她的儿子。
    她的儿子鲍里斯·库巴列夫在靠近中国边界的地方为集体农庄放牧一群牲畜。忽然，那里刮起了暴风雪，他在四天之内没有离开牲畜群，终于迷失了路途，走到中华人民共和国境内，他精疲力尽，冻倒在地上。中国同志立即救护他，把他送进了医院。当他恢复健康后，就把他送回了国。
    库巴列娃写道，我不认得救我儿子的这些中国人是谁，但是他们的行为是真挚的朋友的行为。
