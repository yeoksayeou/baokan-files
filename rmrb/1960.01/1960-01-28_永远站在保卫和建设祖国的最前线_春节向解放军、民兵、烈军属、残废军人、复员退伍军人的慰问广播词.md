Comrades of all officers and soldiers of the beloved Chinese People's Liberation Army, comrades of the national militia, beloved families of martyrs, families of military personnel, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers!
    The Spring Festival of 1960 has arrived. As the people of the whole country joyously celebrate this traditional festival, the entire nation will naturally think of you. Now, on behalf of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, I extend to you my cordial greetings and warm congratulations.
    Dear comrades, 1959 was a year of continued great leap forward for our country. In this year, all socialist construction undertakings have been greatly developed throughout the country. The total industrial output value greatly exceeded the state's plan, with steel production reaching 13.35 million tons, an increase of 67% compared to 1958. Although our country's rural areas suffered severe natural disasters, agricultural production still achieved a bumper harvest. Cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also greatly developed, and the people's living standards have been further improved. Through the continued great leap forward of 1959, the Party's general line for building socialism has become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The situation of continuous leap forward in all socialist construction, both at high speed and in proportion, has been completely established. The organization of the national people's communes is becoming increasingly sound, and its superiority is becoming increasingly apparent. Now, our country's socialist construction has entered a new stage, and both urban and rural areas throughout the country are filled with a prosperous atmosphere.
    The attainment of these great achievements is due to the united and heroic struggle of the people of the whole country under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the adherence to and implementation of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes. This, of course, also includes the hard work of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the national militia, and the national families of martyrs, families of military personnel, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers. In the past year, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has victoriously completed the glorious tasks of defending and building the motherland. The troops on the Fujian front heroically defended the motherland's coastal and border defenses, and severely打击 [dǎ jī - strike, hit, attack] the Chiang Kai-shek army's harassment and sabotage activities. In March of last year, the Tibet Military Region troops swiftly quelled the armed rebellion launched by the reactionary upper strata of Tibet, enabling the people of Tibet to gain a new life. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is not only a hero in defending the motherland but also a good man in building the motherland. Throughout last year, it contributed a total of more than 40 million workdays, helping the people build water conservancy projects, participating in the construction and expansion of large-scale industrial and mining enterprises, and participating in various labors of the nearby people's communes. Various specialized troops also used a large amount of modern equipment and technical forces to support industrial and agricultural production and construction, and helped the people's communes train tractor drivers, car drivers, and other technical personnel. The militia throughout the country played a powerful shock role in various production and construction posts. The national families of martyrs, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers, together with the people of the whole country, also made great contributions to the production and construction of 1959. In particular, more than seven million demobilized and retired soldiers, in the past year, inherited and carried forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and initiative on the industrial and agricultural production fronts and in various work positions, in rectifying and consolidating the people's communes, and in various political movements, and have been widely praised by the Party and the government and the people.
    Dear comrades, we have victoriously passed 1959, and the bright prospects of 1960 have already been displayed before us. This year, the people of the whole country will better implement the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, better implement the principle of "walking on two legs," and, on the basis of the continuous great leap forward in 1958 and 1959, better and more comprehensively realize the continued leap forward in 1960.
    The current international situation is continuing to develop in a direction favorable to peace and favorable to socialism. The international tensions created by imperialism have eased to a certain extent. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger day by day, the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing, and the days of the imperialist camp are getting harder and harder. The emergence of this situation fully confirms the complete correctness of Chairman Mao's famous judgment that "the East wind prevails over the West wind" and "the enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day." The people of our country and the people of the world are all happy about this. However, we must also see that behind the "peace" smokescreen released by U.S. imperialism, it still adheres to the "Cold War" policy and is stepping up war preparations. Recently, U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries colluded with each other to sign a military alliance treaty, which once again proves that the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to create international tensions and prepare to launch wars of aggression has not changed in essence. We cannot relax our vigilance in the slightest.
    Comrades of all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the people of the motherland hope that in this new year, you will strive to study politics, study Chairman Mao's military thought, continue to strengthen military training, further improve the level of military science, strengthen combat effectiveness, enhance military-civilian unity, and achieve greater achievements in defending the motherland's border and coastal defenses and in supporting national economic construction. And be ready at any time to give any invading enemy a heavy blow to defend the security of the motherland.
    Comrades of all families of martyrs, families of military personnel, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers, in order to successfully realize this year's production and construction tasks, the people of the motherland hope that you will further establish socialist and communist ideology, and under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, in all industrial and agricultural production and in your own work positions, together with the broad masses of people, play a greater active role. Comrades of families of martyrs and demobilized and retired soldiers in rural areas should more actively participate in various labors of the people's communes and, together with the broad masses of peasants, prepare for a large increase in agricultural production this year; actively participate in the local water conservancy construction movement, increase new irrigation areas, which is an important condition for increasing agricultural production; actively participate in developing the pig raising business of the people's communes, raise more pigs, accumulate more fertilizer, strive to increase the yield per unit area of crops, and actively engage in technical innovation activities to raise agricultural labor productivity to a higher level. Comrades of families of martyrs and demobilized and retired soldiers in industry, transportation, commerce, culture, education, and all work positions should continue to go all out, aim high, set lofty ambitions, and strive to increase production, improve work efficiency, and make our socialist construction undertakings continue to leap forward. At the same time, we also hope that you will often closely maintain contact with your relatives and comrades-in-arms in the troops, and encourage them to make greater contributions in the great cause of defending and building the motherland.
    Dear comrades, the great socialist construction of the motherland is developing rapidly, and the great ideals for which revolutionary martyrs shed their blood and sacrificed themselves are gradually being realized. No reactionary force can stop our path forward. Let us, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the glorious illumination of the general line, and together with the broad masses of people, always stand at the forefront of defending and building the motherland.
    I wish you a happy holiday and good health!
                                            January 27, 1960

    永远站在保卫和建设祖国的最前线
    春节向解放军、民兵、烈军属、残废军人、复员退伍军人的慰问广播词
    内务部副部长　郭炳坤亲爱的中国人民解放军全体官兵同志们，全国民兵同志们，亲爱的烈士家属、军人家属、革命残废军人、复员退伍军人同志们！
    1960年的春节来到了。正当举国上下欢度这个传统节日的时候，全国人民自然会怀念起你们。现在，我代表内务部向你们致以亲切的慰问和热烈的祝贺。
    亲爱的同志们，1959年是我国继续大跃进的一年。这一年，在全国范围内，各项社会主义建设事业都有了巨大的发展。工业总产值大大超过了国家的计划，其中钢产量达到一千三百三十五万吨，比1958年增长67％。我国农村虽然遭受了严重的自然灾害，而农业生产仍然获得了丰收。文教卫生事业也有很大发展，人民生活有了进一步的提高。经过1959年的继续大跃进，党的建设社会主义的总路线更加深入人心。今后各项社会主义建设既高速度、又按比例的连续跃进的局面，已经完全奠定下来。全国人民公社的组织日益健全，它的优越性日益显著。现在，我国的社会主义建设已经开始了一个新阶段，全国城乡都洋溢着欣欣向荣的大好气象。
    这些伟大成就的获得，都是由于在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，全国人民团结一致英勇奋斗，坚持贯彻了总路线、大跃进和人民公社的结果。这当然也包括了中国人民解放军全体官兵、全国民兵和全国烈士家属、军人家属、革命残废军人、复员退伍军人的辛勤劳动。过去的一年当中，中国人民解放军胜利地完成了保卫和建设祖国的光荣任务。福建前线部队英勇地保卫了祖国的海防和边防，沉重地打击了蒋军的骚扰破坏活动。去年3月，西藏军区部队迅速地平息了由西藏上层反动集团发动的武装叛乱，使西藏人民获得了新生。中国人民解放军既是保卫祖国的英雄，也是建设祖国的好汉。去年全年共献出四千多万个劳动日，帮助人民群众兴建水利工程，参加新建和扩建大型工矿企业，以及参加附近地区人民公社的各项劳动。各特种兵部队还以大量的现代化装备和技术力量，支援了工农业生产建设，并且帮助人民公社训练拖拉机手和汽车驾驶员等各种技术人员。全国各地的民兵在各个生产建设岗位上，发挥了强大的突击作用。全国烈军属和革命残废军人、复员退伍军人，同全国人民一道，在1959年的生产建设中，也有很大的贡献。特别是七百多万复员退伍军人，在过去的一年中，继承和发扬了人民解放军的优良传统，在工农业生产战线上和各个工作岗位上，在整顿和巩固人民公社中，在各项政治运动里，都表现了高度的积极性和首创精神，受到了党和政府以及人民群众的普遍赞扬。
    亲爱的同志们，我们已经胜利地度过了1959年，1960年的光明前景已经展示在我们的面前。今年全国人民将要更好地贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，更好地贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，在1958年和1959年连续大跃进的基础上，更好地全面地实现1960年的继续跃进。
    目前的国际局势正在继续向有利于和平、有利于社会主义的方向发展。帝国主义制造的国际紧张局势有了一定程度的缓和。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量日益强大，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动正在蓬勃发展，帝国主义阵营的日子越来越不好过了。这种局势的出现，完全证实了毛主席的“东风压倒西风”和“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”的著名论断是完全正确的。我国人民和全世界人民都为此感到高兴。但是，我们还必须看到，美帝国主义在放出“和平”烟幕的后面，仍然坚持“冷战”政策，并且正在加紧进行战争准备。最近美帝国主义和日本反动派相互勾结签定了军事同盟条约，这就又一次证明了，美帝国主义制造国际紧张局势和准备发动侵略战争的阴谋，在本质上并没有什么改变。对此，我们不能丝毫放松警惕。
    人民解放军全体官兵同志们，祖国人民希望你们在这新的一年当中，努力学习政治，学习毛主席的军事思想，继续加强军事训练，进一步提高军事科学水平，加强战斗力，增强军民团结，在保卫祖国的边防、海防，在支援国家经济建设当中，获得更大的成就。并且随时准备给任何来犯的敌人以沉重的打击，保卫祖国的安全。
    全体烈士家属、军人家属、革命残废军人、复员退伍军人同志们，为了胜利地实现今年的生产建设任务，祖国人民希望你们进一步树立社会主义、共产主义思想，在各级党委和政府的领导下，在各项工农业生产中和自己的工作岗位上，和广大人民群众一起，发挥更大的积极作用。农村的烈军属和复员退伍军人同志们，更要积极参加人民公社的各项劳动，和广大农民一起，为今年的农业大增产作好准备；要积极参加当地的水利建设运动，增加新的灌溉面积，这是增加农业生产的重要条件；要积极参加发展人民公社的养猪事业，多养猪、多积肥，努力提高农作物的单位面积产量，积极从事技术革新活动，把农业劳动生产率提到更高的水平。在工业、交通运输、商业、文化教育和一切工作岗位上的烈军属和复员退伍军人同志们，都要继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，树雄心，立大志，努力增加生产，提高工作效率，使我们的社会主义建设事业继续跃进。同时，还希望你们经常密切同部队的亲人们和战友们之间的联系，勉励他们在保卫和建设祖国的伟大事业中建立更大的功勋。
    亲爱的同志们，伟大的祖国社会主义建设事业正在飞跃发展，革命先烈为之流血牺牲、梦寐以求的伟大理想，正在逐步实现，任何反动势力也阻挡不了我们前进的道路。让我们在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，和广大人民群众一道，永远站在保卫和建设祖国的最前线。
    祝你们节日快乐，身体健康！
                                            1960年1月27日
