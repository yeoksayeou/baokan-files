“Native” Creation Provides “Foreign” Experience, Small Pieces Solve Big Problems
“Building Block” Machine Tools Reach a New Level
Harbin Jilian Machinery Factory’s “Building Block” Machine Tools Achieve Automation, Multi-Functionality, and Versatility

(Our newspaper’s dispatch from Harbin, January 20th) The Harbin Jilian Machinery Factory, which created “building block” machine tools during the Great Leap Forward, has closely cooperated with Harbin Institute of Technology. After a year of effort, the "building block" machine tool has achieved new developments – successfully creating a set of large-scale "three-izations" and "four-degree" "building block" machine tools.

The new large-scale "three-ization" (operation automation, multi-functional use, component standardization) and "four-degree" (high precision, high speed, high rigidity, reasonable tool angle) "building block" machine tool is composed of thirteen components. It can be interchangeably assembled into six groups of machine tools such as horizontal lathes, boring and milling combined machine tools, herringbone gear milling machines, single-column milling machines, steering milling machines, and vertical milling machines. This new type of "building block" machine tool not only maintains the original "building block" machine tool's characteristics of being detachable and assemblable, simple in structure, easy to manufacture, small can do big, flexible, and easy to operate, but also expands its scope of use. The "building block" machine tool created the year before last could only be applied to mechanical processing such as turning, planing, and milling flat surfaces; now it has surpassed the past range and expanded to new processes such as boring, drilling, milling sides, milling herringbone gears, grinding flat surfaces, and grinding outer diameters. It can process large products as large as 650 mm rolling mills; it can adapt to the technological requirements of parts in a thousand different ways, and the performance of various special machine tools assembled is completely comparable to modern machine tools; sometimes general modern machine tools cannot process parts, but this "building block" machine tool can. Taking the processing of large-diameter shafts as an example, the diameter of the workpiece can reach one meter, and after the guide rail is moved, it can process parts with a diameter of 3.2 meters. The maximum cutting speed is 150 mm per minute, the maximum cutting depth is 20 mm, the power is 40 kilowatts, and the feed rate can reach 4.2 mm. At the same time, because several special machine heads can be processed simultaneously, the number of times of loading and unloading workpieces and adjusting machine tools is reduced, which can greatly shorten production auxiliary time.

This "building block" machine tool is not only suitable for general-purpose machinery, but also for specialized machinery, especially in the mechanization and automation of single-piece and small-batch production, it has great adaptability. At present, in Harbin's machinery industry, single-piece and small-batch production account for more than 50%, and the degree of automation is very low. Most of these special machine tools for processing single-piece and small-batch products need to be specially designed and ordered. With "building block" machine tools, mechanical industrial enterprises can assemble the required special machine tools themselves according to production needs using "building blocks," solving the above problems.

The development of "building block" machine tools to "three-izations" and "four-degree" is a victory for the Party's "walking on two legs" policy and the result of continuous struggle against right-leaning thoughts. In 1959, the production tasks of the Jilian Machinery Factory were not only diverse but also large in product specifications and strict in precision requirements. For example, the largest part of the 650mm rolling mill had a diameter of 3.2 meters, and the factory did not have such a large machine tool for processing. A small number of cadres developed a fear of difficulties and relaxation, believing that "building block" machine tools were not standardized, had low efficiency, and could not complete such arduous tasks. The factory Party committee, in response to these conservative ideas and fear of difficulties, organized a big airing, big contending, and big debate; and used concrete facts to illustrate that "building block" machine tools can not only do big jobs but also do precision jobs.

After unifying ideological understanding, the factory Party committee put forward the call to the workers to develop in the direction of "three-izations" and "four-degree." And factory leaders, technicians, workers, and teachers and students from the machine tool design major of Harbin Institute of Technology, using the method of "three combinations," on the one hand, summarized the experience of "building block" machine tools, and on the other hand, absorbed the advantages of various machine tools at home and abroad, and designed a set of large-scale "building block" machine tools that meet the "three-izations and four-degree" standards. At the same time, each workshop also combined the design and trial production of new "building block" machine tools of "three-izations and four-degree," and respectively formed technical research groups, setting off a mass technical innovation and technical revolution upsurge, improving and developing the original "building block" machine tools. For example, the circular arc turning "building block" machine tool jointly created by workers Jiang Qi'en, Li Jijing, Zhang Lijun, etc., created a spherical die on the basis of the three major components of the original "building block" machine tool, which changed the past manual method of finding a circle into a mechanical method, breaking through the quality barrier and breaking through the major key that the lathe could not turn spherical body parts. According to this experience, the employees of the fourth workshop successfully modified a multi-purpose "building block" vertical lathe, which could arbitrarily replace relevant parts and assemble several machine tools such as turning, milling, planing, and drilling. Moreover, the past method of assembling a machine tool that could only complete one process has developed to be able to complete several processes.

    “土”创造提供“洋”经验　小拼大解决大问题
    “积木式”机床更上一层楼
    哈尔滨机联机械厂“积木式”机床实现自动化多能化通用化
    本报哈尔滨20日电　大跃进中创造“积木式”机床的哈尔滨机联机械厂，和哈尔滨工业大学密切合作，经过一年来的努力，使“积木式”机床又有了新的发展——创造成功一套大型的“三化”“四度”的“积木式”机床。
    新式大型“三化”（运转自动化、用途多能化、部件通用化）、“四度”（高精度、高速度、高刚度、合理刀具角度）“积木式”机床，是用十三个部件组成的。它可以互换拼组成卧式车床、镗铣联合机床、人字齿轮铣床、单柱铣床、转向铣床和立铣床等六组机床。这种新型“积木式”机床不仅保持了原来“积木式”机床可拆可拼、结构简单、制造容易、以小干大、灵活自如和操作方便等特点，而且扩大了使用范围。前年创造的“积木式”机床、只能应用于车、刨、铣平面等机械加工；现在它已经超越了过去的范围，扩大到镗、钻、铣侧面、铣人字齿轮、磨平面、磨外径等新工序。它可以加工像六五零毫米轧钢机那样大的大型产品；能千变万化地适应零件工艺要求，而且组装成的各种专用机床，性能完全可以和现代机床相媲美；有时一般现代化机床不能加工的零件，这种“积木式”机床也能加工。以加工大直径轴类为例，工作物直径可达一米，导轨移动后可加工直径三点二米的零件，切削速度最大每分钟为一百五十毫米，吃切深度最大为二十毫米，功率四十瓩，进给量可达四点二毫米。同时由于几个专用机头可以同时加工，减少了装卸工作物和调整机床工具的次数，可以大大缩短生产辅助时间。
    这种“积木式”机床，不仅适用于通用性机械，也适用于专业性机械，特别在单件小批生产的机械化和自动化方面，有着很大的适应性。目前，哈尔滨市机械工业中，单件及小批生产约占50％以上，且自动化的程度很低，这些加工单件小批产品的专用机床又多半需要特别设计和订货。有了“积木式”机床，各机械工业企业就可以按生产需要，用“积木块”自行组装成所需要的专用机床，解决上述问题。
    “积木式”机床发展到“三化”“四度”，是党的“两条腿走路”方针的胜利，是不断和右倾思想作斗争的结果。1959年，机联机械厂的生产任务不仅品种多，而且产品规格大、精密度要求严格。如650毫米轧钢机最大部件的直径达三点二米，工厂没有这样大的机床加工。一小部分干部产生了畏难松劲情绪，认为“积木式”机床不正规、效能低，不能完成这样繁重的任务。工厂党委针对这些保守思想和畏难情绪，组织大鸣大放大辩论；并用具体事实说明“积木式”机床不仅能干大活，而且也能干精密活。
    在统一思想认识后，工厂党委向职工提出了向“三化”“四度”方向发展的号召。并由工厂的领导干部、技术人员、工人和哈尔滨工业大学机床设计专业师生，采用“三结合”的办法，一面总结“积木式”机床的经验，一面吸取国内外各种机床的优点，设计出一套符合“三化、四度”标准的大型“积木式”机床。同时，各车间还结合设计试制“三化、四度”的新型“积木式”机床，分别组成技术研究组，掀起群众性的技术革新和技术革命高潮，提高和发展了原有的“积木式”机床。如工人姜奇恩、李继敬、张立君等共同创造的车圆弧“积木式”机床，在原“积木式”机床的三大件基础上，创造了一个球形胎具，就由过去用手工找圆变成了用机械找圆，突破了质量关，突破了车床不能车球形体部件的重大关键。四车间职工根据这一经验，改制成功一台多用的“积木式”立车，可以任意更换其中有关部件，拼组成车、铣、刨、钻等数种机床，而且由过去拼一种机床只能完成一道工序的加工任务，发展到能完成几道工序的加工任务。
