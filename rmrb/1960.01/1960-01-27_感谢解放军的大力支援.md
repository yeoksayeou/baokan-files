    Thanks to the Strong Support of the People's Liberation Army
    He Jiangping, Secretary of the People's Commune Party Committee on the Xiamen Front

    1959 was a year of continued and comprehensive great leap forward in all undertakings in our country, and also a year of unprecedented bumper harvests for the People's Commune on the front line. The total output value of the commune's industrial and agricultural income last year increased by 79.7% compared with 1958. Our commune's people, located on the forefront of coastal defense, were able to achieve great victories in the struggle against the enemy, and also achieve great bumper harvests in industrial and agricultural production and construction. This is the result of the united efforts of the army and people on the front line, their close cooperation, mutual support, and joint struggle, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party.

    Since the severe punishment of the Chiang Kai-shek army's artillery bombardment on August 23, 1958, in order to achieve victory, all men, women, old and young in the commune have devoted themselves to the movement of supporting the front and fighting against the enemy. The broad masses, risking their lives, assisted the troops in building roads, fortifications, transporting shells, mending clothes, delivering tea, and carrying stretchers. In the day and night struggle, we and the troops organized a strict joint army-civilian defense, and together took on the task of guarding the coastline. Some became artillerymen, directly fighting alongside the troops, forming an impregnable wall and ensuring the victory of the struggle.

    The army, navy, and air force on the coastal defense front not only vigilantly defend the coastal defense of the motherland at all times, and bravely and tenaciously inflict relentless blows on the enemy, enabling us to carry out peaceful labor and life; at the same time, in the midst of intense and busy training, preparedness, and work study, they organize a large amount of manpower and materials to help us with production and construction, and have forged an inseparable relationship with us like fish and water. After communization, they sent a large number of experienced officers to help our commune rectify and consolidate the militia organization, help us organize production, and rectify cultural and welfare undertakings such as nurseries, kindergartens, and canteens.

    The troops regard the work of the commune as their own task. During last year's busy season and various production and construction projects, the troops organized a large amount of manpower, vehicles, and various tools to help us with rush harvesting, rush planting, and rush transportation, and also helped us open up mountains for planting vegetables, planting trees and forests, building water conservancy projects, and accumulating and transporting fertilizer. Whether in the hot summer or the cold winter, the officers and soldiers of the troops rolled up their sleeves and went barefoot, throwing themselves into battle, and even some wounded soldiers in the field hospital stubbornly participated in our productive labor.

    In disaster relief, the people's fighters showed even more their noble quality of serving the people. During the summer harvest of 1959, we encountered more than a month of continuous rain. More than 6,000 mu of early rice and more than 5,000 mu of sorghum in the commune were about to be submerged. The troop leaders immediately organized thousands of soldiers to cooperate with the commune members to rush the harvest, and took the initiative to vacate barracks, warehouses, and offices for us to dry the grain in the shade. Some soldiers gave up their kitchens to the commune members, while they themselves cooked in tents under storms. On August 23 last year, we suffered from a super typhoon with torrential rain of level 12 or above. The seawalls and dams in Xiamen city were washed away, houses collapsed, agricultural implements and crops were destroyed, and ancient trees that were more than three hundred years old were uprooted. In this serious situation, the heroic People's Liberation Army not only did a good job of rescue themselves, but also cared for the masses at all times, and organized a large army overnight to cooperate with us in rescuing the masses and repairing the seawalls, so that the whole commune restored production in less than three days, and helped us replant after the disaster, so that we completed the planting of 15,000 mu of crops in just twenty-five days.

    The troops also care very much about our lives. When there are work-related injuries among the masses, they do everything possible to rescue and care for them, so that the injured commune members can quickly recover their health and return to production.

    The friendship between our army and people on the front line is evergreen. Our army and people will further improve cooperation, unite as one, and strive to build a beautiful socialist society, consolidate the national defense of the motherland, and liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu at an early date.

    感谢解放军的大力支援
    厦门前线人民公社党委书记　何江萍
    1959年是我国各项事业继续全面大跃进的一年，也是前线人民公社取得空前未有的大丰收的一年。全社去年工农业收入总产值比1958年增加79．7％。处在海防最前线的我社人民，能够在取得对敌斗争巨大胜利的同时，又取得工农业生产建设的大丰收，这是在党的英明正确领导下，前线军民团结一致，密切配合，互相支援，共同奋斗的结果。
    从1958年8月23日严惩蒋军炮战以来，为了胜利，全社男女老少投入了支前对敌斗争运动。广大群众冒着生命的危险，协助部队修公路、修工事、运炮弹、补洗衣服、送茶水、抬担架。在日日夜夜斗争中，我们与部队组织了严密的军民联防，一起担负起海岸线上的警戒任务。有的当了炮手，直接与部队并肩作战，形成了铜墙铁壁，保证了斗争的胜利。
    在海防前线的陆海空三军，不仅时刻警惕地保卫祖国的海防，英勇顽强地给予敌人无情的打击，使我们能够进行和平劳动和生活；同时，在紧张繁忙的训练备战和工作学习中，组织大批人力、物力，帮助我们生产建设，同我们结下了鱼水难分的关系。公社化后，他们抽了大批富有经验的军官，帮助我们公社整顿巩固民兵组织，帮助我们组织生产，整顿托儿所、幼儿园、食堂等文化福利事业。
    部队把公社的工作，看成自己的任务。在去年大忙季节和各项生产建设中，部队组织了大批人力、车辆和各种工具帮助我们进行抢收抢种抢运，还帮我们开山种菜，植树造林，兴修水利，积肥运肥。部队干部和战士们不论在炎热的夏天，或寒冷的冬天，都是卷袖赤脚，投入战斗，连野战医院里的一些伤员战士，也顽强地参加了我们的生产劳动。
    在抗灾救灾中，人民战士更显出了为人民服务的高贵品质。1959年夏收，碰上了一个多月的连绵霪雨，全社六千多亩早稻，五千多亩高粱，眼看就要受淹，部队首长立即组织成千战士，配合社员进行抢收，并主动腾出营房、仓库、办公室给我们阴干粮食，有些战士把厨房让给社员，自己却在暴风雨下搭帐篷煮饭。去年8月23日，遭到十二级以上特大台风暴雨袭击，厦门市的海堤水坝被冲垮，房倒屋塌，农具、作物被摧毁，三百多年的古老大树也被连根拔起。在这严重的情况下，英勇的人民解放军不仅自己做好抢救，同时还时刻地关心群众，连夜组织大军配合我们抢救群众，抢修海堤，使全社不到三天时间就恢复了生产，灾后还帮我们抢种，使我们只用二十五天就种完一万五千亩庄稼。
    部队也十分关心我们的生活，碰上群众工伤事故，千方百计进行抢救、护理，使受伤的社员迅速恢复健康，投入生产。
    我们前线军民的友谊，是万古长青的。我们军民将进一步搞好协作，拧成一股绳，为建设美好的社会主义社会，为巩固祖国海防，为早日解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖而奋斗。
