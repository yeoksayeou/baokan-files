The U.S.-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" was signed in Washington on January 19. This is a serious challenge to China, the Soviet Union, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by U.S. imperialism colluding with Japanese reactionary forces, and also a serious challenge to the people of the Far East and Asia. The United States, disregarding the strong opposition of the people of all countries in the world (including the Japanese people), brazenly signed this treaty. This fact itself powerfully illustrates that the United States is currently continuing to implement an imperialist policy of arms expansion and war preparation. In order to thoroughly expose the true face of U.S. imperialism, this newspaper publishes today the full text of Eisenhower's 1960 "State of the Union Address" and a summary of the "Budget Message" to the U.S. Congress. These two documents are worth reading, because they are quite typical of the U.S.'s current set of practices in diplomacy. From this, we can see what the basic policy of the United States is, what its purpose is, and what the so-called "peaceful intentions" so vigorously promoted by the United States are all about.

Recently, Eisenhower and other responsible officials of the U.S. government have said a lot about "peace." In this "State of the Union Address," Eisenhower again stated that the United States is "determined" to "devote itself to the cause of peace," and he wants people to believe how "eagerly [the U.S.] seeks guaranteed peace." Of course, if the United States can prove these "peaceful intentions" with facts, it would be welcome. However, until today, the United States, while talking about peace, has been busy continuing to expand arms and prepare for war, continuing to create a Cold War, continuing to oppress and exploit its own people, continuing to use military blocs to control other Western countries, continuing to invade undeveloped countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and continuing to be hostile to socialist countries. All this shows that the tactics of imperialism can change, but the essence and basic policies cannot be changed. Eisenhower's "State of the Union Address" is the best proof of the imperialist nature of the United States.

According to U.S. practice, the president must state the government's domestic and foreign policies in the "State of the Union Address" every year and announce what will be done in the new year. If the United States were truly eager to seek peace, shouldn't Eisenhower fully express in the "State of the Union Address" which specific steps the United States will take to ease international tensions? However, people cannot find the shadow of these things after reading the entire "State of the Union Address." Regarding some major international disputes that currently exist, that is, some substantive issues that have a major relationship with world peace, such as the disarmament issue, the issue of banning nuclear weapons tests, etc., Eisenhower has not put forward any solutions or any proposals conducive to peace. In particular, Eisenhower even completely avoided mentioning the East-West summit meeting, the German issue, and the West Berlin issue, which are of concern to people all over the world.

So, what does Eisenhower want to do? In his "State of the Union Address," he loudly proclaimed that it is necessary to proceed "from a position of strength with a broad base," "maintain a high degree of military effectiveness," and "dedicate every bit of our strength" to provide "genuine deterrent power." He announced that the United States will step up the implementation of the "military missile program" and boasted in great detail about the so-called "achievements" of the United States in testing the "Atlas" intercontinental missile. Eisenhower said, "This year, more and more nuclear-powered submarines will join our active forces, some of which will be equipped with 'Polaris' missiles." "We continue to maintain our aircraft carrier forces, our many troops abroad, our ever-ready Army strategic forces and Marine Corps divisions, as well as civilian personnel," and "constantly strengthen" them. He also said that it is necessary to "arrange our military assistance to these allies on a longer-term basis" in order to "establish a sounder collective defense system." In order to do its best to implement the policy of arms expansion and war preparation, Eisenhower, disregarding the fact that the U.S. government's national debt has reached the threshold of more than 290 billion U.S. dollars, disregarding the serious situation of the fiscal deficit of 12.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1959, and disregarding that U.S. inflation is "like a fire endangering our homes," still stipulates in the "Budget Message" that military expenditures for the 1961 fiscal year, that is, expenditures under the so-called "major national security" item, will reach 45.568 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 57.1% of total expenditures. In short, all the stuff of the "policy of strength" and "deterrence policy" that the United States has been pursuing since the end of the war, as well as the main means adopted to implement this policy, namely: huge military budgets, a frenzied arms race, military blocs and military bases all over the world, and military assistance to the United States' "allies" and the reactionaries of various countries, can be said to be all-inclusive in Eisenhower's "State of the Union Address." People can only draw one conclusion from this, that is, the basic policy of arms expansion and war preparation pursued by the United States for a long time has not changed in any way. No wonder U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright said that Eisenhower's "State of the Union Address" was just a reiteration of "what he says every year." U.S. political commentator Sulzberger also pointed out that the current U.S. foreign policy "has no substantial difference from the previous policy," and it is "wrong" to think that the current U.S. policy "has replaced the old Dulles policy."

In fact, what the United States has done in terms of arms expansion and war preparation is far more than what Eisenhower has trumpeted in the "State of the Union Address." It is precisely in the recent months when Eisenhower has been talking about "peace" that the United States has stepped up large-scale war preparations and is adjusting and strengthening the U.S.'s strategic deployment around the world. First, the United States reorganized the agency leading missile production and concentrated its efforts on developing intercontinental missiles. Missile funding for the 1961 fiscal year will reach 8 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 1 billion U.S. dollars over the 1960 fiscal year. Second, in addition to the four medium-range missile bases that the United States has already built in the United Kingdom, it is stepping up the construction of two medium-range missile bases in Italy, and has also reached an agreement with Turkey on establishing medium-range missile bases, and is also negotiating with Greece to establish such bases. The United States is also preparing to establish missile bases in Iran and Pakistan. Third, in the Far East, the United States continues to carry out activities to prepare for war. In addition to signing a new military alliance treaty with Japan to prepare for a new war of aggression, the United States continues to arm the Kuomintang army in Taiwan and constantly conducts military provocations and war threats against China. U.S. Army Secretary Bruck recently openly clamored to "defend the coastal islands of Nationalist China." In addition, the United States is establishing and expanding missile bases in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, China. Fourth, Eisenhower announced that the United States is prepared to resume nuclear testing at any time from New Year's Day this year. Fifth, in December 1959, the United States, through the North Atlantic Group Council, formulated a ten-year plan to strengthen the "military system," giving the North Atlantic Group the "deterrent power" to carry out large-scale nuclear war and the "flexibility" to carry out local wars. Sixth, the United States continues to step up the arming of West German militarism, directly helps West Germany conduct nuclear arming, and hands over missile weapons to West Germany. According to U.S. requirements, West Germany is implementing its arms expansion plan and will have twelve divisions by 1963 (currently there are nine divisions).

All these activities, which seriously threaten world peace and exacerbate international tensions, are carried out under the guise of "peace." Even recently, after the Soviet Union announced a unilateral reduction of its armed forces by 1.2 million people, the U.S. State Department, in a statement, not only did not indicate that the United States would take corresponding steps in disarmament, but falsely claimed that the Soviet Union's disarmament was only an unverifiable "intention." U.S. Vice President Nixon even openly clamored: "Under no circumstances should the United States and its allies reduce their forces." Eisenhower's budget message, which stipulates that military spending accounts for 57.1% of total expenditures, was also submitted to the U.S. Congress on the 18th, just after the Soviet Supreme Soviet decided to unilaterally reduce its armed forces on the 15th. Eisenhower defended the U.S.'s policy of arms expansion and war preparation, saying, "We should not deceive ourselves," and "We must remain strong as we seek the true path to peace and disarmament." He demanded that the U.S. military force "must be able to successfully cope with" "from limited emergencies to all-out atomic nuclear war." All this clearly shows that Eisenhower's so-called "devotion to the cause of peace" is completely deceptive.

In recent months, the so-called "peace strategy" adopted by the U.S. authorities to cover up its arms expansion and war preparation activities has become a topic of much discussion in international public opinion. U.S. officials have talked a lot about peace during this period and have tried to portray themselves as "messengers of peace." In fact, this strategic shift in the United States did not begin just a few months ago. It can be traced back to two years ago, shortly after the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite went into space. On January 16, 1958, Dulles said that a turning point had appeared in the struggle between the two camps. He believed that "if we act like a mad bull in a bullring, lowering our heads and blindly rushing toward the red cape of the matador, then we may be destroyed." Therefore, he proposed a so-called "noble strategy of winning peace." Eisenhower also said at a press conference on March 12, 1959, "I am against rushing into things without proper preparation. So I tell you, we don't want to engage in battles where we are always at a disadvantage, whether it is a political, economic, or military battle." These words show that the U.S. ruling clique understands that because the East wind has prevailed over the West wind, and the balance of world power has undergone a fundamental change in which socialist and peace forces have overwhelmed imperialist and war forces, the United States has fallen behind in rocket weapons, and its "brinkmanship" policy has gone bankrupt. In this case, what kind of disaster will war adventures bring to itself. Therefore, in the eyes of U.S. policymakers, the focus of current U.S. policy should be to buy time to revive military superiority and make preparations in all aspects. A research report published by the Washington Hopkins Institute of International Affairs in December 1959 said that the main problem for the United States in the early 1960s was to strive to "eliminate the expected missile lag." This report also said that even with a "crash program," this could not be done quickly, so it would take time. Now, Eisenhower recites peace scriptures, hides nuclear weapons in his sleeves, and uses a mild and peaceful posture to cover up tense war preparation activities. This is a concrete application of Dulles's so-called "noble strategy of winning peace."

The hypocrisy of the U.S.'s so-called "peaceful intentions," the U.S.'s imperialist reactionary nature, is particularly nakedly manifested in its extremely hostile attitude toward the socialist camp. In the "State of the Union Address," Eisenhower used vicious "Cold War" language, falsely accusing the establishment of socialist countries as "forcible conquest of free people," falsely accusing socialist countries as "police states," falsely accusing the socialist camp as a "gloomy system of satellite countries," and falsely accusing the Soviet Union as "imperialist communism." This slander, of course, cannot harm socialist countries in the slightest, but it fully exposes the true face of the U.S. authorities, so that all peace-loving people around the world, especially the people of socialist countries, recognize how Eisenhower, who talks a lot about peace, is filled with irreconcilable hatred for the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, as well as the working people of the world, and recognize that his so-called "just peace" is essentially an anti-socialist and anti-working people's peace, thus educating the people of all countries to be vigilant against U.S. imperialism and not harbor any unrealistic illusions. Everyone knows that the vast majority of socialist countries were liberated in the anti-fascist war. As for the People's Republic of China, it was established by the Chinese people after decades of arduous struggle, finally defeating the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek group, which was strongly supported by U.S. imperialism. The people of all these socialist countries, after being completely liberated, have become the masters of the country, overthrown the feudal class and the bourgeoisie, eliminated all national oppression and class oppression, and enjoyed true democratic freedom. It is precisely because of this that the people of socialist countries have exerted great creative power, completing construction undertakings in more than a decade that could not be done in the past several centuries, thereby renewing the entire national life. Pre-liberation Czechoslovakia, although its industry was relatively developed, its industrial production grew by only 1% to 2% per year, while after the establishment of the socialist system, it grew by an average of 10% to 12% per year. Albania, which was economically backward in the past, has also been leaping forward since liberation. From 1950 to 1958, its industrial production increased by an average of 20.6% per year. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, after being liberated from Japanese colonial rule, was severely damaged by the U.S. invading army. After the Korean armistice, it rebuilt its homeland from the ruins of war. From 1953 to 1958, industrial production increased by an average of 42.46% per year. In the decade since its establishment, the People's Republic of China has increased its industrial production by more than tenfold and its agricultural production by 1.4 times. It is obvious that the fact that the people of socialist countries are being the masters of their own affairs and building a prosperous country does not suit the wishes of U.S. imperialism. What Eisenhower and his gang are pursuing is for the Hungarian people to return to the dark era of Horthy, for the Polish people to be under the reactionary rule of Piłsudski again, for the Czechoslovak people to suffer the trampling of Hitler's iron hoofs again, for the people of North Korea and North Vietnam to put on the shackles of Japanese colonialism again, and for the Chiang Kai-shek group to restore its evil rule over the Chinese people. In the eyes of the U.S. monopoly capital group, only this can be regarded as "freedom" and "liberation"! This is also the "just peace" and "unity in freedom" that Eisenhower talks about!

Imperialists always view the world with their own jackal eyes. Eisenhower, because he is only accustomed to the master-servant relationship between the United States and its vassal states, falsely accuses the socialist camp as a "gloomy system of satellite countries" and falsely accuses the Soviet Union as "imperialist communism." The socialist countries have formed a socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. It is indeed a world system, but this is (and can only be) a world system based on the fraternal alliance of equality, mutual respect, mutual assistance, and common socialist and communist goals. The socialist countries are united and consistent with each other, and at the same time, they are independent and autonomous. The most advanced and most powerful first socialist country, the Soviet Union, is naturally the center of the unity of the socialist countries. Imperialists are unwilling and unable to understand this new type of international relationship. They dream of dividing the unity of socialist countries and destroying and disintegrating the socialist camp, but their conspiracies can never succeed.

Eisenhower said, "We live in a sea of semantic confusion." It is none other than himself and imperialists like him who create "semantic confusion." Eisenhower has completely turned things upside down. His slander of socialist countries is precisely a portrayal of U.S. imperialism. First of all, it is U.S. imperialism that uses "force to conquer free people." It armed and invaded Korea, where it carried out the most barbaric burning, killing, and looting, and even carried out inhuman germ warfare. It was none other than U.S. imperialism that armed and intervened in Lebanon, armed and subverted the government of Guatemala, and armed and suppressed the people of Panama. U.S. imperialism still occupies the southern part of Korea and Vietnam by force, and occupies Taiwan, China. U.S. armed forces are stationed on the territory of many countries. U.S. monopoly capital is ubiquitous in the capitalist world, exploiting the people of many countries. Because of all this, as stated in the Moscow Declaration of the Twelve Communist Parties, "the U.S. imperialist aggressive group has become the center of reactionary forces in the world and the most ferocious enemy of the masses of the people." Secondly, the world's largest "police state" is also the United States. The United States has established a huge police and secret service organization domestically to carry out terrorist rule and persecution against the people. U.S. industrialist Eaton said, "If the police of (U.S.) cities, localities, states, and government departments are added together, Hitler did not have such a large espionage organization as the United States has today." As for the "gloomy system of satellite countries," the most typical is the North Atlantic Group pieced together by the United States. In this "system," the United States dominates and wants others to serve the interests and war policies of the U.S. monopoly capital group. The internal relations of this "system" are the most indecent scramble and intrigue. "The New York Times" said that the various contradictions of the Western alliance "have surfaced disgustingly" and that it has shown "a tendency to decline." Isn't even Eisenhower himself dissatisfied with this "gloomy" situation, so that he personally came forward to exert pressure at the Paris conference not long ago?

It is very obvious that the reason why Eisenhower wants to reverse black and white and slander socialist countries is to have these "unfree" countries undergo his so-called "liberation" and thus become part of the so-called "free world." This can also be proved from the mouths of other influential figures in the U.S. ruling clique. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Berding said that he does not agree with peaceful coexistence with the socialist camp, because "accepting the concept of peaceful coexistence is equivalent to fixing the status quo, and the current status quo is that the Soviet Union rules the communist bloc. We do not want to contribute to maintaining this status quo forever." A research report published by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund on December 6, 1959, said: "In developing Europe, it is necessary to open the door to those countries and people who were historically linked to Europe but are now pulled into the Soviet orbit. They must be welcomed to participate in the spiritual and cultural life of Europe in every opportunity. In this way... European civilization will once again become part of the broader Atlantic community." It can be seen from this that the United States is not reconciled to the "status quo" of socialist countries being liberated from capitalist enslavement. It still has not given up its so-called "liberation policy."

However, because the United States suffered defeats in the past in the war of aggression against Korea and the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary, and because the balance of world power has undergone changes unfavorable to the United States, it cannot but feel that the method of conquest by force is becoming increasingly difficult. It is precisely because of this that Eisenhower's "liberation policy" is now painted with the color of "peace." One of the U.S.'s attempts is to use the so-called "expanded exchanges" mentioned by Eisenhower in his message to corrode the people of socialist countries, vainly attempting to make these countries degenerate (or, as U.S. politicians call it, "evolve") into a capitalist system. A study report published by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on January 17, entitled "Ideology and Diplomacy," said that in view of "the ideological forces playing a role on the international political stage," U.S. foreign policy must "encourage the evolution within the Soviet system and the Communist bloc." "We should promote the widest possible contact with the communist world. Our policy should be to encourage genuine exchanges that are different from formal interactions." "The United States should make every effort to develop extensive contact with intellectuals in the communist camp, and eventually with upper and middle-level political figures, in order to gradually influence their ideological beliefs." U.S. Information Agency Director Allen also said, "Personnel exchanges are one of the gaps that the United States has broken through the Iron Curtain; every time we break a gap in the Iron Curtain and let the light in, we win in the ideological battle." The illusions filled in these words show how crazy and reactionary the U.S. rulers are. No matter how "peaceful" the imperialists speak, they never deviate from their original intention, and their ultimate goal is still to attempt to undermine, subvert, and eliminate socialist countries.

The United States' two-faced approach of false peace and real war preparation, and the inconsistency between the United States' words and deeds, have been widely criticized. Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev pointed out in his speech on January 14 that the leaders of Western countries still have not given up the policy of "strength" and the policy of "deterrence."

Czechoslovak "Red Rights News" pointed out that Eisenhower's message showed that U.S. policy still has not moved forward from its current state of stagnation.

Hungarian "People's Free Newspaper" said that Eisenhower has not forgotten to talk about peace in every speech, but the U.S. government only thinks of military aid programs, military bases, and military blocs around the world.

Public opinion in many Asian, African, and Latin American countries made sharp exposures of Eisenhower's posture of disguising peace and disguising sympathy for national independence. Japanese "Red Flag Newspaper" pointed out that "Eisenhower said some words that seemed to advocate peace in the State of the Union Address, but this was not from his heart." The United States "still wants to adhere to the Cold War policy and strengthen the military system aimed at attacking the socialist camp, dreaming of regaining military superiority." Indonesian "Dawn Daily" also pointed out that "Eisenhower said that the United States hopes to establish a world where all countries prosper and are not invaded, but the United States has been building missile bases, atomic rocket bases, and bases for airplanes carrying nuclear missile warheads everywhere." Cambodian "People's Newspaper" pointed out that "U.S. leaders talk about 'peace' only to step up war preparation." Lebanese "Beirut Evening News" said that "when Arabs see photos of President Eisenhower raising his hands and shouting peace in Rome, Ankara, and Karachi, and at the same time see news in the newspaper that the United States supports France in fighting the Algerians, they can see the hypocrisy of the United States' two-faced policy at a glance." Moroccan "Vanguard Newspaper" pointed out the hypocrisy of U.S. foreign policy and said that Eisenhower once said that the United States hopes that all countries will not be oppressed, but "the United States stands on the side of countries that violate freedom, disregard justice, and destroy peace in the United Nations and refuses to support the cause of Algeria." Cuban "Mellia" magazine said that "while Eisenhower is indulging in empty talk about peace, he caresses Trujillo and Somoza, lends money to Stroessner, protects anti-Cuban war criminals exiled in Miami, and kisses Franco's hand," so he is a "fierce eagle" disguised as a "peace dove."

Even public opinion in many Western countries has expressed dissatisfaction with Eisenhower's approach. "New York Post" said that Eisenhower's announcement that the United States has the freedom to resume nuclear testing is "the most unpleasant New Year's greeting to the world." British "Daily Telegraph" also said that "the more Eisenhower assures Americans that they have strong power, the less convincing his hopes for peace are."

In short, from East to West, the United States' two-faced approach has been seen through by more and more people. Even if it can still confuse some people at present, it is impossible to last long.

Facts tell us that imperialists have two weapons, one is real guns and ammunition, and the other is sugar-coated bullets; there are two faces, one is the blatant, fierce, and vicious true face, and the other is the dressed-up, charitable mask. But its purpose is only one, that is, to preserve imperialism and eliminate socialism; to preserve reactionary forces and eliminate progressive forces; to preserve the "free world" of aggressors and oppressors and eliminate the people's true freedom. The current approach of the United States is a combination of these two weapons and two faces. However, the United States' peace talks and war preparation activities are so self-contradictory that the result will inevitably be self-exposure. Eisenhower's "State of the Union Address" and "Budget Message" have already done a good job in this regard. It can be determined that as long as the United States continues to play this two-faced trick, it will expose itself in more ways.

The task of peace-loving people all over the world is to be vigilant and expose the various false peace conspiracies of the United States, unite, continue to struggle, defeat the war forces headed by U.S. imperialism, and expand the victory of the world's peace forces. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is fighting for world peace, the labor movement with the communist parties of various countries as the core, the increasingly high national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the peace movement including broad strata, constitute the most powerful force in the contemporary era, enough to overwhelm the imperialist war forces. We are deeply convinced that further strengthening the unity of the world's peace forces and further strengthening the struggle against the imperialist war forces will surely enable the international tension to be truly further eased and the cause of world peace to be truly and reliably guaranteed.

### 美国总统的咨文说明了什么

    美国总统的咨文说明了什么
    日美“共同合作和安全条约”已经在1月19日在华盛顿签字了。这是美帝国主义勾结日本反动势力对中国、苏联和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的严重挑战，也是对远东和亚洲各国人民的严重挑战。美国不顾世界各国人民（包括日本人民在内）的强烈反对，悍然签订这个条约，这个事实本身有力地说明美国目前所继续执行的是帝国主义的扩军备战政策。为了彻底揭穿美国的帝国主义的真面目，本报今天发表艾森豪威尔向美国国会提出的1960年“国情咨文”的全文和“预算咨文”的摘要。这两份文件值得大家一读，因为它们相当典型地说明了美国目前在外交上的一套做法。从这里可以看出，美国的基本政策是什么，它要达到的目的是什么，美国大肆宣扬的所谓“和平意图”究竟是怎么一回事。
    最近一个时期，艾森豪威尔和美国政府其他负责人讲了不少关于“和平”的话。在这一次的“国情咨文”里，艾森豪威尔又表示，美国已经“下定决心”“致力于和平事业”，他并且要人相信美国是“多么热切地谋求有保证的和平”。当然，如果美国能够用事实来证明它的这些“和平意图”，那是值得欢迎的。然而，直到今天为止，美国一边空谈和平，一边却忙于继续扩军备战，继续制造冷战，继续压迫和剥削本国人民，继续利用军事集团控制其他西方国家，继续侵略亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的不发达国家，继续敌视社会主义国家。这一切说明了，帝国主义的策略可以改变，本质和基本政策却是不能改变的。艾森豪威尔的“国情咨文”就是美国的帝国主义本质的一个最好的证明。
    按照美国的惯例，总统每年都要在“国情咨文”中说明政府的内外政策，宣布在新的一年里将要做些什么事情。如果美国真是热切地谋求和平的话，艾森豪威尔不是完全应该在“国情咨文”中表示美国为缓和国际紧张局势将要采取哪些具体步骤吗？可是，人们读完了整篇的“国情咨文”，就找不到这些东西的影子。对于目前存在的一些重大的国际争端，也就是同世界和平有重大关系的一些实质问题，例如裁军问题、禁止核武器试验问题等等，艾森豪威尔不曾提出任何解决的办法和任何有利于和平的建议。特别是对于全世界人民所关心的东西方最高级会议、德国问题和西柏林问题，艾森豪威尔甚至完全避而不谈。
    那么，艾森豪威尔要做的事情是什么呢？他在“国情咨文”中大声疾呼地说，必须“从具有广泛基础的实力地位出发”，“保持高度的军事效能”，而且“要奉献出我们的任何一点力量”，来提供“真正的威慑力量”。他宣布美国将加紧执行“军事导弹计划”，并且不厌其详地炫耀美国试验“阿特拉斯”洲际导弹的所谓“成绩”。艾森豪威尔说，“今年将有越来越多的核发动的潜水艇参加我们的现役部队，其中有些潜水艇将装有‘北极星’式导弹。”“我们继续保持我们的航空母舰部队、我们在国外的许多部队、我们的始终作好准备的陆军战略部队和海军陆战队师以及非军事人员”，并且“不断加强”。他还说要“在更长远的基础上安排我们给这些盟国的军事援助”，以“建立更健全的集体防御体系”。为了竭尽全力实行扩军备战政策，艾森豪威尔不顾美国政府的国债已经达到二千九百多亿美元的大关，不顾1959年度财政赤字达到一百二十五亿美元的严重情况，也不顾美国通货膨胀“像一场危及我们的家屋的火灾一样”，仍然在“预算咨文”中规定1961财政年度的军事开支，即在所谓“主要的国家安全”项下的开支，达四百五十五亿六千八百万美元，占全部支出的57．1％。总而言之，美国战后以来一直执行的“实力政策”和
  “威慑政策”的全部货色，以及为了执行这种政策而采取的主要手段，即：庞大的军事预算，疯狂的军备竞赛，遍布全球的军事集团和军事基地，以及对美国的“盟国”和世界各国反动派的军事援助等等，在艾森豪威尔的“国情咨文”里，可以说是一应俱全。人们从这里只能得出一个结论，这就是美国长时期以来所奉行的扩军备战的基本政策没有任何改变。无怪乎美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特说，艾森豪威尔的“国情咨文”不过是重申了“他每年所说的东西”。美国政论家苏兹贝格也指出，美国现行外交政策“同以前的政策并没有实质的差别”，如果认为美国现在的政策“已经代替了旧的杜勒斯政策的话，那是错误的”。
    事实上，美国在扩军备战方面所做的事情，比艾森豪威尔在“国情咨文”里所鼓吹的还要多得多。正是在艾森豪威尔大谈“和平”的最近几个月里，美国加紧了大规模的备战措施，并且正在调整和加强美国在全世界的战略部署。第一，美国改组了领导导弹生产的机构，集中力量发展洲际导弹。1961财政年度导弹经费将达八十亿美元，比1960财政年度增加十亿美元。第二，美国除了已经在英国建成四个中程导弹基地以外，正在意大利加紧建筑两个中程导弹基地，还同土耳其达成了关于建立中程导弹基地的协议，也同希腊谈判建立这种基地。美国还准备在伊朗和巴基斯坦建立导弹基地。第三，在远东，美国继续进行准备战争的活动。美国除了同日本签订新的军事同盟条约，准备新的侵略战争，还继续武装台湾国民党军队，并且不断对中国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。美国陆军部长布鲁克最近就公开叫嚷将“保卫国民党中国的沿海岛屿”。此外，美国正在日本、南朝鲜和中国台湾建立和扩建导弹基地。第四，艾森豪威尔宣布从今年元旦起美国准备随时恢复核试验。第五，美国在1959年12月通过北大西洋集团理事会，制定了加强“军事体系”的十年计划，使北大西洋集团具有进行大规模核战争的“威慑力量”和进行局部战争的“灵活性”。第六，美国继续加紧武装西德军国主义，直接帮助西德进行核武装，并把导弹武器交给西德。根据美国的要求，西德正在执行它的扩军计划，到1963年将拥有十二个师（目前有九个师）。
    所有这些严重威胁世界和平和加剧国际紧张局势的活动，都是在“和平”的幌子下进行的。甚至在最近，在苏联宣布单方面裁减武装部队一百二十万人之后，美国国务院在声明中不但没有表示美国将在裁军方面采取相应的步骤，反而诬称苏联的裁军只是无法检查的“意图”。美国副总统尼克松甚至公然叫嚷：“在任何情况下，美国和它的盟国都不可减少它们的兵力。”艾森豪威尔的规定军费占全部支出57．1％的预算咨文，也正是在苏联最高苏维埃15日决定单方面裁减武装部队以后才在18日向美国国会提出的。艾森豪威尔为美国这种扩军备战的政策辩护说，“我们不应该自己欺骗自己”，“我们在寻求走向和平和裁军的真正的道路时必须保持强大”。他要求美国的军事力量“必须能够成功地应付”“从有限的紧急事件直到全面的原子核大战”。这一切都清楚地说明，艾森豪威尔所说的“致力于和平事业”完全是骗人的勾当。
    最近几个月中，美国当局采取这种掩盖它的扩军备战活动的所谓“和平策略”，成为国际舆论议论纷纷的题目。美国的官员们在这个期间关于和平的谈论特别多，他们曾经力图把自己打扮得好像是“和平使者”。其实，美国的这种策略转变，并不是几个月之前才开始，它可以追溯到两年以前，追溯到苏联第一颗人造卫星上天以后不久。1958年1月16日，杜勒斯就说过，两大阵营之间的斗争出现了一个转折点。他认为，“如果我们做起事来像斗牛场中的一头低下头去盲目冲向斗牛士的红斗篷的蛮牛一样，那么，我们就可能要遭到毁灭”。因此他提出了一个所谓“和平取胜的高尚战略”。艾森豪威尔在1959年3月12日的记者招待会上也说，“我反对没有好好准备就慌张地干起来。所以我告诉你，我们根本不想进行我们始终处于不利地位的战斗，不论是政治性、经济性还是军事性的战斗。”这些话表明，美国统治集团懂得，由于东风压倒了西风，世界力量对比发生了社会主义力量和和平力量压倒帝国主义力量和战争力量的根本变化，美国在火箭武器方面落后了，它的“战争边缘”政策破产了，在这种情况下进行战争冒险将会给它自己带来怎么样的灾难。因此，在美国的决策者看来，当前美国政策的重点应该是为重振军事优势争得时间，在一切方面做好准备。1959年12月发表的华盛顿霍普金斯国际问题研究所的一份研究报告说，美国在六十年代初期的主要问题，就是要争取“消灭预期的导弹方面的落后状态”。这个报告并且说，即使进行“突击计划”，也不能很快就做到这一点，因此这就需要时间。现在，艾森豪威尔口诵和平经，袖藏核武器，用缓和的和平姿态来掩盖紧张的备战活动，正是杜勒斯所谓“和平取胜的高尚战略”的具体运用。
    美国所谓“和平意图”的虚伪性，美国的帝国主义反动本质，特别露骨地表现在它对社会主义阵营所采取的极端敌视的态度上。艾森豪威尔在“国情咨文”中使用恶毒的“冷战”语言，把社会主义国家的建立诬蔑为“武力征服自由人民”，把社会主义国家诬蔑为“警察国家”，把社会主义阵营诬蔑为“阴郁的卫星国体系”，把苏联诬蔑为“帝国主义的共产主义”。这种诬蔑当然丝毫也不能损害社会主义国家，却完全暴露了美国当局的真面目，使全世界一切爱好和平的人民，首先是社会主义各国人民，认清了大谈和平的艾森豪威尔对于苏联和整个社会主义阵营以及全世界劳动人民是怎样充满不可调和的仇恨，认清了他的所谓“正义的和平”实质上就是反社会主义的、反劳动人民的和平，因而教育了各国人民对于美帝国主义要提高警惕，不要存任何不切实际的幻想。谁都知道，绝大多数社会主义国家都是在反法西斯战争中获得解放的。至于中华人民共和国，是中国人民经过几十年的艰苦奋斗，最后战胜了美帝国主义大力支持的蒋介石集团的反动统治而建立起来的。所有这些社会主义国家的人民，在得到彻底解放以后，都做了国家的主人，推翻了封建阶级和资产阶级，消灭了一切民族压迫和阶级压迫，享受到了真正的民主自由。正是因为这样，社会主义各国人民发挥了伟大的创造力量，在十几年里完成了过去几个世纪都无法做到的建设事业，从而使整个国家生活焕然一新。解放前的捷克斯洛伐克，工业虽然比较发达，但它的工业生产每年增长不过1％至2％，而在社会主义制度建立以后，平均每年增长10％至12％。过去经济落后的阿尔巴尼亚，解放以后也在飞跃前进，从1950年到1958年，它的工业生产平均每年增长20．6％。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，从日本殖民统治解放出来之后，又遭到美国侵略军队的严重破坏，朝鲜停战以后从战争废墟中重建家园，在1953至1958年中，工业生产平均每年增长42．46％。中华人民共和国在建立以来的十年中，工业生产增长十倍以上，农业生产增长一点四倍。社会主义国家人民当家作主，建设欣欣向荣，这显然不合美帝国主义的心意。艾森豪威尔一伙人追求的是要匈牙利人民重新回到霍尔蒂的黑暗时代，要波兰人民重新处于毕苏斯基的反动统治之下，要捷克斯洛伐克人民重新遭受希特勒铁蹄的践踏，要朝鲜北部和越南北部的人民重新套上日本殖民主义的枷锁，要蒋介石集团重新恢复对中国人民的万恶统治。在美国垄断资本集团看来，只有这样才算作“自由”和“解放”！这也就是艾森豪威尔所说的“正义的和平”和“自由中的团结”！
    帝国主义者总是用自己的豺狼的眼睛来观看世界。艾森豪威尔因为仅仅习惯于美国同它的附庸国家的主仆关系，才把社会主义阵营诬蔑为“阴郁的卫星国体系”，把苏联诬蔑为“帝国主义的共产主义”。社会主义各国结成了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，的确是一个世界体系，然而这是（也只能是）建立在平等的、互相尊重和互相帮助的、具有社会主义和共产主义的共同目标的兄弟联盟的基础之上的世界体系。社会主义各国是相互团结一致的，同时又是各自独立自主的。最先进的最强大的第一个社会主义国家苏联，自然是社会主义各国的团结的中心。帝国主义者不愿意也不可能理解这种新型的国际关系。他们梦想分化社会主义国家的团结，破坏和瓦解社会主义阵营，但是他们的阴谋活动绝不能得逞。
    艾森豪威尔说，“我们生活在一个语义混乱的海洋中。”制造“语义混乱”的不是别人，而正是他自己以及跟他一样的帝国主义分子。艾森豪威尔把事情完全弄颠倒了。他对社会主义国家的诬蔑，恰恰就是对美帝国主义的写照。首先，用“武力征服自由人民”的正是美帝国主义。它武装侵略朝鲜，在那里进行了最野蛮的烧杀抢掠，甚至进行了绝灭人性的细菌战。武装干涉黎巴嫩、武装颠复危地马拉政府、武装镇压巴拿马人民的，不是别人，正是美帝国主义。美帝国主义至今仍然用武力侵占着朝鲜和越南的南部，侵占着中国的台湾。美国武装部队驻扎在许多国家的领土上。美国垄断资本在资本主义世界无孔不入，剥削着许多国家的人民。由于这一切，诚如莫斯科十二国共产党宣言所说，“美国的帝国主义侵略集团已成为全世界反动势力的中心，成为人民群众的最凶恶的敌人”。其次，世界上最大的“警察国家”也正是美国。美国在国内建立了庞大的警察和特务机构，用来对人民进行恐怖统治和迫害。美国工业家伊顿说过，“如果把（美国）各城市、各地方、各州和政府各部门的警察加在一起，希特勒也没有过像美国今天这样大的特务组织。”至于说到“阴郁的卫星国体系”，那么最典型的莫过于美国所拼凑的北大西洋集团了。在这个“体系”里，美国称王称霸，要别人为美国垄断资本集团的利益和战争政策效劳。这个“体系”的内部关系，是最不体面的你争我夺、勾心斗角的关系。“纽约时报”说，西方联盟的各种各样的矛盾“讨厌地表面化了”，它已经出现“衰落的趋势”。对于这种“阴郁”的情况，不是连艾森豪威尔自己也感到不满意，以至在前不久的巴黎会议上亲自出马施加压力吗？
    非常明显，艾森豪威尔所以要颠倒黑白，对社会主义国家进行诽谤，其目的就是要这些“不自由”的国家来一次他所谓的“解放”，从而变为所谓“自由世界”的一部分。关于这一点，还可以从美国统治集团中其他有势力人物的口里得到证明。美国助理国务卿伯丁说过，他不赞成同社会主义阵营和平共处，因为“接受和平共处的概念，就等于把现状固定下来，而当前的现状，是苏联统治着共产主义集团。我们不希望出力把这种现状永远保持下去”。洛克菲勒兄弟基金会在1959年12月6日发表的一篇研究报告说：“在发展欧洲时，必须对在历史上同欧洲连结在一起而现在被拉进苏联轨道去的那些国家和人民打开大门。必须欢迎他们在一切有机会的情况下，参加欧洲的精神与文化生活。这样……欧洲文明将再度成为更广泛的大西洋共同体的一部分。”由此可见，美国对于社会主义国家从资本主义奴役下获得解放的“现状”，是不甘心的。它仍然没有放弃它的所谓“解放政策”。
    但是，由于美国过去在侵朝战争中和匈牙利反革命叛乱中都遭到了失败，由于世界力量对比发生了对美国不利的变化，它不能不感觉到使用武力征服的办法是越来越困难了。正是因为这样，现在艾森豪威尔的“解放政策”也涂上了“和平”的色彩。美国的企图之一，就是艾森豪威尔在咨文中所说的通过所谓“扩大交往”，来腐蚀社会主义各国人民，妄想使这些国家蜕变（或者像美国政客们所说的叫做“演化”）为资本主义制度。美国参议院外交委员会1月17日发表的一个题为“意识形态和外交”的研究报告说，鉴于“在国际政治舞台上起作用的意识形态方面的力量”，美国对外政策必须“鼓励苏维埃制度和共产党集团内部的演化”。“我们应该促进同共产党世界的尽可能广泛的接触。我们的政策应该是鼓励有别于形式上的来往的真正来往”。“美国应该竭力发展同共产党阵营的知识分子、最后同上层和中层政界人物的广泛接触，以便逐渐影响他们的思想信仰”。美国新闻署署长艾伦也说过，“人员交往是美国在铁幕上突破的缺口之一；每一次我们在铁幕上突破一个缺口，让光线射进去，我们就在思想战斗中取得胜利。”这些话里所充满的幻想表明了美国统治者是怎样疯狂和反动。不管帝国主义者在口头上讲得多么“和平”，但万变不离其宗，其最终目的仍然是企图破坏、颠复和消灭社会主义国家。
  美国这种假和平、真备战的两面手法，美国的言行不一，已经受到广泛的指责。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在1月14日的演说中指出：西方国家的领导人仍然没有放弃“实力地位”政策和“威慑”政策。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”指出，艾森豪威尔的咨文表明，美国的政策仍然没有从现在所处的裹足不前的状态中前进一步。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”说，艾森豪威尔在他的每一次讲话中都没有忘记谈谈和平，但是美国政府在全世界却只想到军事援助纲领、军事基地和军事集团。
    许多亚非和拉丁美洲国家的舆论，对于艾森豪威尔伪装和平和伪装同情民族独立的姿态，作了尖锐的揭露。日本“赤旗报”指出，“艾森豪威尔在国情咨文中说了一些好像是主张和平的话，这并非出于本心”。美国“仍然要坚持冷战政策，并且加强以攻击社会主义阵营为目的的军事体系，梦想挽回军事优势。”印度尼西亚“黎明日报”也指出，“艾森豪威尔说美国希望建立一个一切国家都繁荣兴盛并且不受侵扰的世界，但是美国却一直在各地建立导弹基地、原子火箭基地以及供载运核导弹弹头的飞机使用的基地。”柬埔寨“人民报”指出，“美国领导人高谈‘和平’，只是为了加紧备战”。黎巴嫩的“贝鲁特晚报”说，“当阿拉伯人看到艾森豪威尔总统在罗马、安卡拉和卡拉奇举着手高喊和平的照片，同时又在报上看到美国支持法国同阿尔及利亚人作战的消息时，他们对于美国口是心非的两面派政策就一目了然了。”摩洛哥的“前卫报”在指出美国外交政策的虚伪性时说，艾森豪威尔曾说过美国希望所有国家不受任何压迫，但是“美国在联合国中站在侵犯自由、无视正义和破坏和平的国家那一边，不肯支持阿尔及利亚的事业”。古巴“梅利亚”杂志说，“艾森豪威尔在侈谈和平的同时，却抚爱着特鲁希略和索摩查，借钱给斯特罗斯纳，保护流亡在迈阿密的反古巴的战犯，亲吻佛朗哥的手”，因此他是一只伪装“和平鸽子”的“凶鹰”。
    甚至许多西方国家的舆论也对艾森豪威尔的做法表示不满。“纽约邮报”说，艾森豪威尔宣布美国有恢复核试验的自由，这是“向全世界发表的最不愉快的新年祝词”。英国“每日电讯报”也说，艾森豪威尔“愈是向美国人保证他们有强大的力量，他的和平希望就愈没有说服力。”
    总之，从东方到西方，美国的两面手法，已经被越来越多的人们看穿，即使它在目前还可能迷惑一些人，也是不可能长久的。
    事实告诉我们，帝国主义者有两种武器，一种是真枪实弹，另一种是糖衣炮弹；有两种面目，一种是明目张胆的凶神恶煞的真面目，另一种是梳装打扮的慈善为怀的假面具。但是它的目的只有一个，那就是保存帝国主义，消灭社会主义；保存反动力量，消灭进步力量；保存侵略者、压迫者的“自由世界”，消灭人民的真正的自由。目前美国的做法就是这两种武器和两种面目的结合。但是，美国的和平谈论和备战活动是这样的自相矛盾，其结果必然是自己揭穿自己。艾森豪威尔的“国情咨文”和“预算咨文”已经在这方面做了很好的工作。可以断定，只要美国继续玩弄这种两面手法，它还会从更多的方面揭露自己。
    全世界爱好和平人民的任务是，警惕和揭露美国的各种各样的假和平阴谋，团结起来，继续斗争，挫败以美帝国主义为首的战争势力，扩大世界和平力量的胜利。为世界和平而奋斗的有以苏联为首的空前强大的社会主义阵营、以各国共产党为核心的工人运动、亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的日益高涨的民族独立运动、包括广泛阶层的和平运动，它们构成了当代最强大的力量，足以压倒帝国主义的战争势力。我们深信，进一步加强世界和平力量的团结，进一步加强反对帝国主义战争势力的斗争，就一定能够使国际紧张局势得到真正的进一步的缓和，使世界和平事业得到真正的可靠的保障。
