Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 5th: The Cambodian "People's Daily" published a commentary on January 5th, stating that the seizure of power by the Laotian army is the result of the thoroughly pro-American Laotian group, the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," carrying out the reactionary plot of the imperialists.

The newspaper said that this will inevitably be detrimental to the harmony of the Laotian nation and the cessation of the civil war. It will further and more thoroughly undermine the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, thereby expanding the civil war, intensifying the tense situation in Indochina, and threatening the peace and security of Southeast Asia.

The newspaper recounted the imperialists' conspiracies to instigate military coups in nationalist countries, and pointed out that Cambodia had experienced such conspiracies, but they had not succeeded. The newspaper also said that the Cambodian people cannot but express concern about the situation in Laos, as it directly threatens Cambodia's peace. The Cambodian people must be vigilant against new conspiracies planned by the imperialists against Cambodia, and unite more closely around the King and Prince Sihanouk.

    柬埔寨“人民报”指出
    老挝政变不利东南亚和平
    新华社金边5日电　柬埔寨“人民报”5日发表评论指出，老挝陆军攫取政权是老挝彻头彻尾亲美集团“保卫国家利益委员会”集团执行帝国主义者的反动阴谋的结果。
    报纸说，这必将不利于老挝民族的和睦和内战的停止。它将进一步和更彻底地破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议，从而扩大内战，加剧印度支那的紧张局势，威胁东南亚的和平与安全。
    报纸追述了帝国主义者在民族主义国家里策动军事政变的阴谋，并且指出，柬埔寨是领教过这种阴谋的，只是这种阴谋没有得逞而已。报纸又说，柬埔寨人民不能不对老挝局势表示不安，因为它直接威胁柬埔寨的和平。柬埔寨人民必须警惕帝国主义者对柬埔寨策划的新阴谋，更紧密地团结在国王和西哈努克亲王周围。
