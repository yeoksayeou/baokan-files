Inspect Promptly, Inspect Comprehensively, Help While Inspecting
Jiangxiang Commune's Spring Ploughing Preparations Basically Completed

(Our dispatch) The Jiangxiang Commune in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, launched a large-scale spring ploughing inspection and immediately took many effective measures based on the inspection results, which promoted the commune's spring ploughing campaign.

The spring ploughing inspection included ten aspects: inspecting the thinking of cadres and the masses, inspecting water conservancy construction, inspecting fertilizer accumulation and production, inspecting winter crop management, inspecting early rice planting area, inspecting farm tools, inspecting improved seeds, inspecting draught cattle, inspecting seedling fields, and inspecting the implementation of plans to teams, measures to fields, and responsibilities to individuals. After a five-day large-scale inspection recently held by Jiangxiang Commune, the commune's spring ploughing preparations have been basically completed, two seasonal periods earlier than in previous years.

After the New Year, the commune party committee decided to hold a large-scale spring ploughing inspection. A total of more than 600 cadres and 120 experienced farmers from the entire commune participated in the inspection team. The inspection method was to look (visit the site), listen (listen to the introduction of the production team cadres), inquire (comfort the commune members), talk (have discussions with the commune members), and take action (find problems and immediately organize the commune members to discuss solutions). The inspection focused on the ten inspections, while also helping the production team arrange spring ploughing work, publicizing the achievements of the Great Leap Forward last year and the favorable conditions for carrying out spring ploughing, conducting Spring Festival condolences to commune members, and helping commune members arrange their lives. Therefore, the inspection team was also a work team, a propaganda team, and a consolation team.

The ten major spring ploughing inspections of Jiangxiang Commune focused on inspecting the thinking of cadres and the masses, inspecting farm tools, inspecting plans, and inspecting the implementation of measures, and finding solutions immediately after discovering problems. In inspecting the thinking of cadres and the masses, it was found that a few people believed that it was still early, and winter production was doing well, so spring ploughing could be done slowly. In inspecting farm tools, it was found that the entire commune was still short of 3,000 large and small farm tools, and 5,000 farm tools needed to be repaired. When inspecting the implementation of plans, measures, and responsibilities, it was found that some teams did not mobilize the masses to discuss production plans in depth, and some teams did not implement the measures to increase production after they were formulated. In inspecting water conservancy, fertilizer, improved seeds, draught cattle and other spring ploughing preparations, some problems were found. While inspecting, the inspection team played the role of a work team and propaganda team, helping the relevant production teams come up with ideas and find solutions, and solving problems on the spot as much as possible. For example, the inspection team of the Riverside Management Area found that the early rice planting plan of the Gaohu Brigade had 150 mu that had not been implemented in the field. The reason was that the area of economic crops had increased, reducing the paddy fields. The inspection team went deep into the commune members' families to offer condolences and investigate the situation of wasteland. Thanks to the active help of the commune members, 190 mu of wasteland and lake fields were found in three days. The brigade only spent 1,600 labor days to reclaim and build water conservancy, and the wasteland was turned into fertile fields, so that the brigade's early rice planting plan was fully implemented in the field.

As soon as the large-scale inspection ended, the commune party committee held another meeting to conduct in-depth research on the measures to solve the problems that had not been solved in the inspection. After the meeting, a large-scale debate was first launched. By calculating tasks, time, and labor force, everyone realized that this year's spring ploughing projects were numerous, large in quantity, and high in quality. Because industry and sideline occupations occupied a part of the labor force, the commune's spring ploughing labor force this year was 1,500 less than last year. Therefore, doing a good job in spring ploughing is an urgent task and cannot be done slowly. On the other hand, combined with the debate, the favorable conditions for continuing the leap forward this year were further analyzed, so that all cadres and commune members established a firm idea of ​​continuing the leap forward and actively invested in spring ploughing.

Secondly, the teams widely mobilized the masses to discuss and further implement the production plans, measures, and responsibilities at all levels. The commune implements fixed output value, fixed commodity output, and fixed public accumulation to the production brigade; the brigade implements fixed labor force, fixed output, and fixed cost to the production team; the production team implements fixed tasks, fixed time, fixed output quality, and fixed remuneration and rewards to the work group; and the work group implements fixed basic work days, fixed base points, and fixed rewards to the commune members.

Third, vigorously carry out farm tool reform activities. On the one hand, carry out extensive publicity and education, explaining that mechanization cannot be waited for, encourage everyone to boldly innovate tools, promote advanced tools, and regard farm tool reform as an important measure to achieve the continued leap forward in agriculture this year; on the other hand, organize carpenters, blacksmiths, and bamboo workers to rush to manufacture and repair farm tools. As a result, more than 28 kinds of new farm tools were created and imitated in more than ten days, and more than 7,000 large and small farm tools were rushed to manufacture and repair.

Fourth, focus on water and fertilizer and comprehensively carry out spring ploughing preparations. The management areas organized special personnel to inspect the quality of water conservancy projects. If problems were found, they immediately sent shock brigades to solve them. At the same time, we are expanding sources of fertilizer and improving fertilizer quality. In addition to vigorously producing compost, mud fertilizer, and ash fertilizer, all 63 chemical fertilizer plants and 60 lime plants in the commune have been fully put into production. The teams adjusted each other to solve the problem of lack of improved seeds and realized the improvement of seeds. In addition, winter management and management of winter seedlings and draught cattle and management of rice seedling fields have been strengthened.

Under the impetus of the inspection team, the commercial, industrial, medical, banking and other departments in the commune have also launched a competitive upsurge to support spring ploughing, which has further promoted the development of the spring ploughing campaign.

    及时检查　全面检查　边查边帮
    蒋巷公社备耕基本就绪
    本报讯　江西省南昌县蒋巷公社开展备耕大检查，并根据检查情况立即采取了许多有效措施，推动了全社的备耕运动。
    备耕大检查包括十项内容，即查干群思想，查水利建设，查积肥造肥，查冬苗管理，查早稻播种面积，查农具，查良种，查耕牛，查秧田，查计划落实到队、措施落实到田、责任落实到人。蒋巷公社最近举行了为期五天的大检查后，全社春耕准备已基本就绪，比往年提早了两个节令。
    新年过后，公社党委即决定举行备耕大检查。全社参加检查团的共有六百多名干部、一百二十名老农。检查方法是边看（现场参观）、边听（听生产队干部介绍），边访（慰问社员），边谈（和社员座谈），边行动（发现问题立即组织社员讨论解决）。检查以十查为中心，同时帮助生产队安排备耕工作，宣传去年大跃进成就和开展备耕的有利条件，进行春节慰问社员，帮助社员安排生活。因此，检查团又是工作团、宣传团和慰问团。
    蒋巷公社备耕十大检查，以查干群思想、查农具、查计划、查措施落实为重点，发现问题，立即寻找解决的办法。在查干群思想中，发现有少数人认为时间还早，冬季生产又搞得好，备耕可以慢慢来；查农具中发现全社还缺少三千件大小农具，有五千件农具需要修补；查计划、措施、责任落实时，发现部分队没有深入发动群众讨论生产计划，有的队制定了增产措施后没有落实到田。在查水利、肥料、良种、耕牛等各项备耕中，发现了一些问题。检查团一面检查，一面发挥了工作团、宣传团的作用，帮助有关生产队出主意、想办法，可以解决的问题尽可能就地解决。例如河边管理区检查团，发现高湖大队早稻播种计划有一百五十亩没有落实到田，原因是增加了经济作物面积后减少了稻田。检查团便深入社员家庭边慰问、边调查荒地情况。由于得到社员的积极帮助，三天中找到了一百九十亩荒地湖田。这个大队只花了一千六百个劳动日开垦和兴修水利后，荒地就变成了良田，使该队早稻播种计划全部落实到了田。
    大检查一结束，公社党委又召开了会议，对检查中没有解决的问题，深入研究了解决的措施。会后，首先开展了大辩论，通过算任务、算时间、算劳力，使大家认识到今年备耕项目多、数量多、质量高；因为工业和副业又占用了一部分劳动力，今年全社备耕的劳力比去年少一千五百个。因此，搞好备耕是当务之急，不能慢慢来。另一方面，结合辩论进一步分析了今年继续跃进的有利条件，使全体干部和社员树立了坚定的继续跃进思想，积极投入备耕。
    其次，各队广泛发动群众讨论，进一步把生产计划、措施、责任层层落实。公社对生产大队实行定产值、定商品产量、定公共积累；大队对生产队实行定劳力、定产量、定成本；生产队对作业组实行定任务、定时间、定产量质量、定报酬奖励；作业组对社员实行定基本劳动日、定底分、定奖励。
    第三，大力开展农具改革活动。一方面广泛开展宣传教育，说明机械化不能坐等，鼓励大家大胆革新工具，推广先进工具，把农具改革做为实现今年农业继续跃进的一项重要措施；另一方面，组织了木工、铁工、篾工赶制赶修农具。结果在十多天中就创制和仿制了二十八种新农具，赶制赶修大小农具七千多件。
    第四，以水、肥为重点，全面开展备耕。各管理区组织专人检查水利工程质量，发现问题，立即派突击队去解决。同时广辟肥源，提高肥料质量，除大搞沤肥、泥肥、灰肥之外，全社六十三个化肥厂、六十个石灰厂全面投入了生产。各队互相调剂解决了缺少良种问题，并实现了良种化。此外，还加强了冬苗、耕牛的冬季护养管理和秧田耕作管理。
    在检查团的推动下，公社内商业、工业、医务、银行等各部门也开展了支援备耕的竞赛热潮，更促进了备耕运动的开展。
