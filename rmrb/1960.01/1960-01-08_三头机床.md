    Three-Head Machine Tool
    The Dalian Valve Factory recently successfully trial-produced a semi-automatic three-head machine tool, paving the way for the factory's valve specialization and automation.
    This semi-automatic machine tool has three heads and is specially designed to process parallel valves from 200mm to 300mm. Its characteristic is three-head clamping with the workpiece fixed and the tool rotating. Each head can be stopped independently, and the tool holder is controlled by a relay, automatically advancing and retracting the tool. The workpiece is placed on a live chuck, eliminating the need for alignment. Workers can automatically perform machining by pressing a button. Efficiency is increased by more than six times, and the product qualification rate reaches 100%.

    三头机床
    大连阀门厂最近试制成功一台半自动化三头机床，为这个厂的阀门专业自动化开辟了一条道路。
    这台半自动化机床有三个机头，专门加工二百毫米到三百毫米的平行阀门。它的特点是三头夹刀，工件固定，刀具旋转。每个机头可以单独停车，刀架由继电器控制，自动进退刀。工作物放在卡活胎上，不用找正，工人按动电钮，就能自动进行加工。效率提高六倍以上，产品合格率达到百分之百。
