    Get Prepared and Strive for a Bumper Fruit Harvest This Year
    Fuxian County Repairs Orchard Irrigation Projects; Huangyan Carefully Cultivates Overwintering Tangerine Trees
    (Our dispatch) Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, which is rich in apples, has launched a vigorous upsurge in winter production management of fruit trees, centered on water and fertilizer, to create conditions for achieving greater fruit tree production this year. Last year, the total apple output of Fuxian County was 12.9% higher than in the bumper year of 1958, and the apple output value accounted for about 30% of the county's total agricultural output value. In order to strive for greater apple production this year, the county's fruit farmers are determined to work hard this winter and spring, focusing on key measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, pruning, winter protection, and eliminating pests and diseases, in order to realize the water conservancy, full fertilization, deep cultivation of mature soil, and pest-free status of fruit tree production. At present, more than 20,000 fruit farmers in the county are working hard in the orchards every day, actively carrying out winter irrigation and early fertilization of fruit trees, so that the fruit trees can eat and drink their fill during the winter dormancy period, accumulate more nutrients, promote vigorous flowering in the spring, high fruit setting rates, and achieve greater production increases. More than 70% of Fuxian County's orchards are located in mountainous areas. Mountain orchards generally have shallow soil layers and severe soil erosion. In order to further improve the growing conditions of fruit trees, it is necessary to adopt methods such as lowering tree pits, building terraces, and maintaining soil and water.
    At present, the county has completed water conservancy projects for irrigating one million fruit trees, and has completed terrace construction projects for the same number. One million trees account for half of the county's fruit-bearing trees. After the socialist education movement, the people's commune of Fuzhou Town further enhanced the production enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. More than 5,200 people in the commune have participated in water conservancy construction. The commune has completed autumn fertilization for 600,000 fruit trees. The Deli Temple People's Commune concentrated superior manpower and adopted the principle of combining centralized deployment and decentralized matching to divide Deli Temple and Shatun into two regions, organizing four operation teams for water and fertilizer, terrace construction, pruning, and fruit tree winter protection to strengthen winter repairs and field management. More than 1,000 water management commune members in the Deli Temple area are vigorously building dams for water storage. The intensive renovation of the 20-li-long main canal has been completed, and the water diversion projects in Matun, Caifangshen, Wangtun and other places have also been repaired. All 40,000 fruit trees here can achieve water conservancy. In addition, since late autumn last year, the commune has organized fertilization teams to accumulate and topdress sufficient fertilizer for fruit trees. In order to do a good job in fruit tree pruning, the Deli Temple Commune held a technical performance competition of teaching and learning by 400 experienced pruning experts in late November last year, training a total of 1,000 fruit tree pruning experts, which promoted the development of pruning work. While vigorously grasping water and fertilizer, the people's communes in Fuxian County have comprehensively carried out winter protection measures such as binding tree trunks and "whitening." The Sun Rising Commune coated more than 70,000 fruit trees with "white coating agent" in seven days. Now, all the large and small fruit trees in the county have put on white "winter protection suits" and are preparing to safely survive the harsh winter.

    (Our dispatch) Huangyan County, Zhejiang, the producing area of Huangyan honey tangerines, which are sold well at home and abroad, after the bumper harvest of honey tangerines in 1959, has vigorously grasped the cultivation and management of winter tangerine orchards, striving for an even greater harvest of citrus fruits this year. At present, more than 50,000 commune members in the county are fertilizing, whitening, cultivating soil, and loosening soil in the tangerine orchards every day, and a mass winter tangerine orchard cultivation and management upsurge has been formed throughout the county.
    Last year was originally a "small year" for Huangyan honey tangerines, but thanks to the careful cultivation and management of tangerine orchards by the people's communes, a harvest similar to that of a "big year" was achieved, and the total output of honey tangerines could exceed that of the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. In summing up the experience of the honey tangerine harvest, the communes in the tangerine area further clarified that early cultivation and good management are important reasons for obtaining a bumper harvest. Many production teams that did a good job in the winter tangerine orchard cultivation and management in 1958 created high-yield honey tangerine records last year. Therefore, the party committees of the people's communes in the tangerine area attached great importance to this year's winter tangerine orchard cultivation and management work, generally grasping it early, tightly, and specifically. The Chengjiang Commune Party Committee specifically deployed the winter tangerine orchard cultivation work when it began picking honey tangerines, put forward specific deadlines for fertilization, whitening, soil cultivation, and soil loosening, and held a meeting of production team party branch secretaries and production team leaders from the entire commune at the end of November last year. It inspected the cultivation and management of tangerine orchards by adopting the methods of comprehensive visits and key inspections.
    One of the characteristics of Huangyan County's winter tangerine orchard cultivation and management work is that it is fast and of good quality. Under the slogan "Apply hundreds of catties of fertilizer in winter, and harvest hundreds of catties of tangerines next year; put in more effort in winter, and pick more burdens of tangerines next year," the broad masses of commune members formed professional teams to rush to apply post-harvest fertilizer, treat insects, and loosen soil. According to statistics, by the end of December last year, the area of tangerine orchards that had been fertilized accounted for more than 95% of the total area of tangerine orchards, and whitening and soil loosening had been completed, and the area of soil cultivation also reached more than 80%. The Chengjiang Commune, which acted the fastest, is nearing completion of various tangerine orchard cultivation and management tasks. The Shangbei Dalu Xialing Production Team of this commune has achieved a bumper harvest of honey tangerines for six consecutive years. The broad masses of commune members are full of enthusiasm and completed fertilization, whitening, deep hoeing, soil loosening, and soil cultivation tasks as early as the beginning of November last year. The quality meets the requirements, making it the production team with the fastest action in tangerine orchard management in the county. Huangyan County's winter tangerine orchard cultivation and management work is done meticulously, and the quality is generally better than the previous year. Because various localities have implemented the guideline of "taking grain as the key link and promoting grain, tangerines, and animal husbandry simultaneously" proposed by the Huangyan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, animal husbandry has developed rapidly, and fertilizer sources have also expanded. The amount of post-harvest fertilizer applied this year is larger and of better quality than the previous year. According to statistics from the Chengjiang Commune, the amount of fertilizer applied last winter increased by 60% compared with the previous year, generally reaching one catty of chemical fertilizer, more than 70 catties of human manure, 30 to 40 dan of pig and cattle manure, and more than 30 catties of ash fertilizer per tangerine tree. Each tangerine tree has been cultivated with four to five dan of soil.
    In the cultivation and management of tangerine orchards, the communes also vigorously grasped advanced examples, established pacesetters, vigorously grasped inspection and evaluation, and organized all aspects of linked competitions. Now, many production teams and production teams, and small teams and small teams have launched competitions, setting off an upsurge of "learning from, comparing with, catching up with, and surpassing" each other. The Chengjiang Commune's Huoxing Production Team, which achieved an average yield of more than 27,000 catties of honey tangerines per mu this year, and the Wangxi Production Team and Zilong Small Team, which achieved a yield of 10,000 catties per mu, are linked in competition, visiting each other and catching up with each other. The Huoxing Team discovered that its tangerine orchard's soil cultivation was behind the Zilong Team, so it went back and worked day and night. The young people of the Zilong Team discovered that the whitening was not as fast as the Huoxing Team, so they urgently mobilized and gave chase.
    In addition to vigorously grasping key cultivation and management tasks such as winter fertilization, whitening, soil cultivation, and soil loosening in tangerine orchards, the broad masses of tangerine farmers in Huangyan County also carried out pruning, mildew removal, sweeping fallen leaves, and eliminating overwintering rust mites and other tangerine orchard cleaning work.

    做好准备力争今年水果大丰收
    复县大修果园灌溉工程  黄岩精心培育过冬桔树
    本报讯　盛产苹果的辽宁省复县各人民公社，掀起了轰轰烈烈的以水、肥为中心的果树冬季生产管理高潮，为实现今年果树生产的更大增产创造条件。去年，复县苹果的总产量比大丰收的1958年还多12．9％，苹果产值已占全县农业总产值的30％左右。全县果农为了争取实现今年苹果的更大增产，决心大干苦干一冬一春，狠抓水、肥、土、修剪、防寒越冬、消灭病虫害等几个关键措施，以实现果树生产的水利化、满粪化、深耕熟土化和无病虫化。目前，全县每天有二万多名果农苦干在果园里，积极进行果树冬季灌溉和早期施肥，让果树在冬休期间吃饱喝足，积累更多的养分，促使春季开花旺盛，坐果率高，实现更大增产。复县果园有70％以上在山地。山地的果园，一般土层浅，水土流失严重。为了进一步改善果树的生育条件，必须采用下放树窝、修梯田、保持水土等办法。
    目前，全县已完成灌溉一百万棵果树的水利工程，完成了同样数量的修梯田工程。一百万棵占全县结果树的一半。复州镇人民公社通过社会主义教育运动，进一步提高了干部群众的生产积极性，全社已有五千二百多人参加了水利建设。全社已完成六十万棵果树的秋季施肥。得利寺公社集中了优势人力，采取集中调用和分散搭配相结合的原则，划分得利寺、沙屯两个地区，组织了水肥、修梯田、剪枝和果树越冬防寒等四个作业队，加强冬修和田间管理工作。得利寺地区的一千多名治水社员，正在大搞拦河蓄水，突击整修二十里长的大渠道已经完工，马屯、蔡房身、王屯等地的引水工程也修好了。这里的四万棵果树可以全部实现水利化。此外，这个公社从去年晚秋开始，就组织了施肥大队，为果树积制和追施了足够的肥料。为了搞好果树修剪工作，得利寺公社在去年11月下旬，由四百名剪枝老手，开展了保教、保会的技术表演赛，共训练了一千名果树剪枝能手，推动了剪枝工作的开展。复县各个人民公社，在大抓水、肥的同时，全面进行了绑扎树干和“涂白”等防寒越冬措施。太阳升公社在七天内把七万多棵果树全部涂上了“白涂剂”。现在，全县的大小果树，已经全部穿上了白色的“防寒服”，准备安全地渡过严冬。

    本报讯　畅销国内外的黄岩蜜桔产地——浙江黄岩县桔区各人民公社，在1959年蜜桔大丰收以后，又狠抓冬季桔园的培育管理工作，力争今年柑桔的更大的丰收。目前，这个县每天有五万多社员，在桔园里施肥、涂白、培土、松土，一个群众性的冬季桔园培育管理热潮，已经在全县范围内形成。
    黄岩蜜桔去年本来是“小年”，但是由于人民公社对桔园进行了精心的培育管理，获得了和“大年”一样的丰收，蜜桔总产量可以超过大跃进的1958年。桔区各公社在总结蜜桔丰收经验中，进一步明确了培育早、管理好是获得丰收的重要原因。很多在1958年冬季桔园培育管理搞得好的生产队，去年都创造了蜜桔高额丰产纪录，因此桔区各人民公社党委对今年冬季桔园的培育管理工作十分重视，普遍抓的早、抓的紧和抓的具体。澄江公社党委在开始采摘蜜桔的时候，就具体部署了冬季的桔园培育工作，提出了施肥、涂白、培土、松土等的具体期限，并于去年11月底召开了全公社的生产队党支部书记和生产队长会议，采取全面参观、重点检查的方法，检查了桔园的培育管理工作。
    黄岩县冬季桔园培育管理工作的特点之一是行动快、质量好。广大社员在“冬季多施百斤肥，来年多收百斤桔；冬季多出一把劲，来年多采一担桔”的口号下，组成了专业队，突击追施采后肥和治虫、松土。据统计，全县到去年12月底，已施肥的桔园面积，占桔园总面积的95％以上，涂白、松土已全部完成，培土面积也达80％以上。行动最快的澄江公社，桔园各项培育管理工作接近完成。这个公社上辈大陆下凌生产队，连续六年获得蜜桔丰收，广大社员干劲十足，早在去年11月初全部完成了施肥、涂白、深锄、松土、培土等任务，质量符合要求，成为全县桔园管理行动最快的生产队。黄岩县桔园冬季培育管理工作做得细致，质量普遍比前一年好。各地由于贯彻执行了中共黄岩县委提出的“以粮为纲、粮桔畜并举”的方针，畜牧业迅速发展，肥源也扩大了，今年施下的采后肥，比前一年量多、质好。据澄江公社统计，去冬施肥量比前年增加60％，普遍达到每株桔树施下一斤化肥和七十多斤人粪、三十至四十担猪牛栏肥和三十多斤灰肥。每株桔树已培土四至五担。
    各公社在桔园培育管理中，还大抓先进、树立标兵，大抓检查评比，组织各方面的挂钩竞赛。现在不少生产队和生产队之间，小队和小队之间，都开展了竞赛，掀起了队队争先进的“学、比、赶、超”热潮。澄江公社今年获得蜜桔平均亩产二万七千多斤的火星生产队和获得亩产万斤的王西生产队和子龙小队挂钩竞赛，相互参观访问，你追我赶。火星队发现自己桔园培土落在子龙队后边，回去就日夜突击。子龙队青年发现涂白还不及火星队快，就紧急动员，奋起直追。
    黄岩县广大桔农除了狠抓桔园的冬季施肥、涂白、培土、松土等重点培育管理外，还进行了剪枝，霉桩，扫落叶，灭越冬锈壁虱等桔园清理工作。　　（朱学亿）
