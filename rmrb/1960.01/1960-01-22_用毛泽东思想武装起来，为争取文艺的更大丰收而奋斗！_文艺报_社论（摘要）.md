The great task of literary and artistic work is to arm the people's minds with socialist and communist spirit, help them remove the shackles of bourgeois ideology and other non-proletarian ideologies left over from the old society, arouse the people's soaring enthusiasm, and help the masses advance history with one heart and one mind and high spirits. Achieving this will help greatly liberate the productive forces, greatly promote the consolidation and development of our new economic base and new social system, and contribute to the progress of mankind. If we are to measure the achievements and contributions of our socialist literature and art, this is the most fundamental criterion.

Our literature and art are undergoing a great revolutionary change; following the road opened up since the May Fourth Movement, especially since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, a brand-new literature and art has emerged on the socialist soil of New China, presenting a beautiful scene of a hundred flowers blooming in socialist literature and art. Whether we look at the breadth and depth of the integration of literature and art with the masses, the transformation, strengthening, and development of the literary and artistic ranks, literature and art becoming the cause of all nationalities, the cause of the whole people, and the cause of the workers, peasants, and soldiers themselves, the universal prosperity and rapid improvement of all fields of literature and art, or the positive role of outstanding literary works, films, dramas, and other artistic works in the hearts of the broad masses, it is no exaggeration to say that the achievements of the past decade have surpassed the thirty years since the May Fourth Movement.

Studying Mao Zedong Thought and adhering to Mao Zedong's direction for literature and art is the most fundamental guarantee for achieving victory. This was the case in the past, and it remains so now and in the future. The great victory of the people's democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction in the region where a quarter of the world's population lives has repeatedly proved that Mao Zedong Thought is the invincible truth of Marxism, the most complete embodiment and creative development of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and Chinese reality. Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought is a systematic embodiment of Marxist-Leninist aesthetics under new historical conditions, and a new development of Marxist-Leninist aesthetics. Based on his famous philosophical thoughts in "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," Comrade Mao Zedong systematically and profoundly solved the relationship between literature and art and revolution, literature and art and the masses, literature and art and life, and dialectically solved the relationship between the popularization and improvement of literature and art, the subjectivity and objectivity of writers, and the criticism and inheritance of revolutionary literature and art towards cultural traditions, based on the actual situation. Based on the principle of correctly handling contradictions among the people, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward an extremely firm class policy for developing Marxist truth and socialist culture in combat, which is the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the principle of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, helping Chinese writers and artists liberate their minds, broaden their horizons, and reflect the new era of the Great Leap Forward from a place higher than reality. Comrade Mao Zedong resolutely opposed foreign stereotypes and Party stereotypes, advocated an accurate, clear, and vivid new style of writing, advocated national forms of literature and art, and advocated a fresh, lively Chinese style and Chinese spirit that the masses love to see and hear. His own articles and speeches are the best examples of this new style and new writing style. In addition, from the Yan'an period until after the founding of New China, he directly led and guided the literary and artistic circles in a series of struggles between the two roads in literature and art, helping the literary and artistic circles clear the old base, liberate productive forces, and open up new roads. His famous work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and other related works are the most systematic theory for developing a new proletarian culture and new literature and art, and at the same time, the most complete and sharp weapon against bourgeois literary thought and against revisionism in literature and art. Comrades in the literary and artistic circles have deeply realized from their own experience that every major victory we have achieved since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, especially in the past ten years, is inseparable from the correct leadership and close guidance of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong.

Thoroughly transforming the world outlook of writers and artists and striving to improve their level of revolutionary world outlook has the most urgent significance today. One of Comrade Mao Zedong's greatest contributions to literary thought is that, based on the philosophical thought of "On Practice" and in light of the actual situation of literary and artistic circles in our country, he pointed out the correct path for writers and artists to transform their world outlook: writers and artists can transform their thinking from one class to another through studying Marxism-Leninism, going deep into the struggle of the masses for a long time, repeatedly combining theory and practice, and closely combining intellectuals with the working people. Over the years, under the guidance of this thought, comrades in the literary and artistic circles have formed a good atmosphere. Many comrades strictly demand themselves in accordance with the principle of proletarian Party spirit, work hard to study revolutionary theory and Party policies, integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and constantly transform their subjective world in order to be consistent with the development direction of the objective world. Doing so has achieved great results. Now, the political and ideological situation in the literary and artistic circles is very different from that before liberation, the political and ideological consciousness of writers and artists has greatly improved, and the face of literature and art in New China has been renewed. However, in this regard, we must not have any complacency. The times are changing too fast. Under the control of the great helmsman, New China's fleet is leaping forward a thousand miles a day. If we lack the spirit of continuous revolution, our thinking will lag behind reality. The lofty mission of current literature and art requires writers and artists to become sincere socialist fighters, and Party member writers and artists should become firm and thorough communists, but many people have not met this requirement. The situation in which thinking lags behind reality and the bourgeois viewpoints of many people have not been fundamentally changed cannot but be reflected in creation and theoretical criticism. To this day, there are still bad creative tendencies to be clarified, and there are still revisionist and other fallacies to be criticized, which is not surprising at all. Of course, the mainstream of the literary and artistic circles is healthy, correct, and full of vitality; even so, every literary and art worker should continue to strengthen their connection with the working people, intensify their studies, strengthen their world outlook with the spirit of continuous revolution, strive to stand at the forefront of the times, and use new works shining with ideological brilliance and revolutionary flames to encourage the masses to rush towards lofty goals.

We should learn from Comrade Mao Zedong and combine the most calm scientific analysis with the most ardent revolutionary spirit. Only in this way can we correctly understand and grasp the creative principle of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, and make our socialist literature and art burst forth with brighter and stronger light and heat. This creative principle is fully in line with the theory of combining continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development; this creative principle itself is the combination of the revolutionary spirit and pragmatic spirit of communists, the combination of the great ideals of communists and the deep understanding of reality in literature and art; it requires literature and art not only to describe the development process of reality, but also to promote the development process of reality; not only to portray people's character and soul, but also to influence people's character and soul; not only to correctly reflect today, but also to enthusiastically look forward to tomorrow; in this way, literature and art must go all out to affirm the new things, new personalities, and new atmosphere of socialism, and praise the communist sprouts in life and the communist style among the masses; it must also severely criticize the old things, and its purpose is to pave the way for the development of new things. Such literature and art is full of revolutionary enthusiasm, so it can turn around and encourage people's revolutionary enthusiasm; it is the most free and liberated literature and art in thought, so it can turn around and promote the liberation of social thought and the liberation of social productive forces. As early as the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong eagerly hoped that artists would produce works that are "higher, more intense, more concentrated, more typical, more ideal, and therefore more universal than ordinary actual life." Such literary works "can awaken the masses, inspire them, promote the masses to unite and fight, and transform their environment." So today, in this new era full of revolutionary miracles, revolutionary ideals, and the whole people building socialism with high spirits, emphasizing the creative principle of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism is even more the requirement of the times. Only in this way can literature and art be consistent with the pace of the Great Leap Forward and produce great effects in the new era. In this regard, Comrade Mao Zedong's poems and lyrics set the best example. Many excellent new folk songs since the Great Leap Forward also embody the spirit of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. In recent years, some noteworthy novels, films, dramas, and other outstanding works have also shown this spirit to varying degrees and have begun to achieve good results.

Marxism is a fighting science, and we should also learn it in battle. Comrade Mao Zedong's works adhere to and develop the revolutionary and fighting characteristics of Marxist-Leninist doctrine, and have been, are, and will be the sharpest weapons against revisionism and all kinds of bourgeois ideologies. Revisionism in literature and art is a reflection of political and philosophical revisionism in literature and art. Its main manifestations are: propagating the decadent viewpoints of bourgeois humanism, the theory of human nature, and human love to blur class boundaries and oppose class struggle; propagating idealism to oppose materialism; propagating individualism to oppose collectivism; negating the educational role of literature and art under the guise of "writing the truth"; opposing literature and art serving politics with the sophistry of "art is politics"; opposing the leadership of the Party and the state over the literary and artistic cause with the cliches of "freedom of creation." Revisionism wears the cloak of Marxism-Leninism and has a very deceptive effect. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Party, the literary and artistic circles have carried out a series of struggles against all kinds of bourgeois ideas and revisionist tendencies in literature and art, giving these reactionary trends of thought a devastating blow. However, modern revisionism is an international phenomenon and is very harmful. Domestically, as long as the influence of the bourgeoisie still exists for a day, revisionism—the bourgeois heresy disguised in revolutionary words—will still emerge. This requires constant struggle and constant cleaning. In this regard, Comrade Mao Zedong's works have given us great help. As long as you read "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" carefully, it is not difficult to find that few of the tricks played by many revisionists at home and abroad today can escape the sharp ideological criticism of Comrade Mao Zedong's sword in those years.

In literature and art, revisionists, on the one hand, propagate various reactionary and decadent tendencies, and on the other hand, distort and utilize the cultural heritage of the past, specializing in promoting the negative factors in it, in order to realize their conspiracy of using the dead to drag down the living, using the bourgeois world outlook to resist the proletarian world outlook, and using outdated and old literary and artistic dogmas to oppose and strangle proletarian literature and art. In the history of European bourgeois culture, many outstanding literary and artistic works have been produced, which have made significant contributions to human culture, and today and in the future, they are still important objects for us to critically study and learn from. However, it should also be seen that it is, after all, the literature and art of another era and another class, and the ideological emotions of individualism, anarchism, pessimism, and sentimentalism spread in many of its works are definitely incompatible with the communist morality and collectivist personality that we want to cultivate today. Revisionists take the shrouds of European classical writers as amulets, try their best to beautify the negative factors in classical works, and spread harmful influences among young people, which is worth noting. Revisionists such as Feng Xuefeng and Qin Zhaoyang tried to obliterate the fundamental difference between critical realism and socialist realism, and instigated people to use the methods of classical writers to expose the old society and criticize the old system, and then turn around to expose the new society and criticize the new reality. Even today, some people still adhere to the artistic standards of the nineteenth century, hoping that socialist literature and art will move towards bourgeois standards and improve along the bourgeois direction. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago: "In literature and art, the uncritical hard moving and imitation of the ancients and foreigners is the most unpromising and most harmful literary dogmatism and artistic dogmatism." We oppose the distortion of revisionism, and we also oppose the dogmatic hard moving and imitation. For the cultural heritage of China and foreign countries, we can only inherit it critically, take its essence, and discard its dross. The purpose of criticism is to inherit better, and the purpose of inheritance is to innovate and create. Without correct criticism, it is impossible to inherit correctly, and there will be no correct innovation and creation. The proletariat neither blindly rejects nor blindly worships the cultural heritage left over from history; but based on the viewpoint of historical materialism, adopts the method of scientific analysis to give them correct historical evaluation; affirms their due historical status, and also points out their era and class limitations; explains what should be learned from them and what should be liquidated or abandoned. In view of the great distortions of the bourgeois cultural heritage by revisionists and bourgeois scholars, the re-evaluation of these heritages is an unavoidable historical task. This is a long-term and arduous task, and we should do it firmly, cautiously, and meticulously.

In the new year, we must raise the banner of proletarian cultural revolution higher, and better practice the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new. In our country, a vigorous cultural revolution movement is being carried out. Hundreds of millions of people have participated in this movement. Intellectualizing the working people and working-classizing the intellectuals are the slogans and goals of this movement. The manifestation of the mass cultural revolution in literature and art is that the workers, peasants, and soldiers have participated in the creation of literary and artistic activities on a large scale and in many aspects, and more and more people have participated in the activities of literary and artistic criticism. This is the most thorough mass line of literary and artistic work, and also the most extensive mass blooming of a hundred flowers and contention of a hundred schools of thought. Looking forward to the new year, this mass blooming of a hundred flowers and contention of a hundred schools of thought will surely be carried out more actively and vividly, and will have a huge promoting effect on the blooming of a hundred flowers and contention of a hundred schools of thought in the entire literary and artistic circles. Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is a revolutionary policy of developing Marxist truth in struggle and developing socialist culture in competition, and it is the firmest class policy. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Correct things always develop in the process of struggling with wrong things. True, good, and beautiful things always exist, compare, and develop in struggle with false, evil, and ugly things." And the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is precisely in accordance with the law of the development of truth, adhering to the positive things, but not afraid of the negative things, and vigorously promoting the victory of correct things, true, good, and beautiful things in the continuous competition and struggle with the negative things. Facts have proved that this policy has nothing in common with bourgeois "liberalization," and it is precisely the sharpest weapon against revisionism and other bourgeois ideas. This policy first adheres to the consistency of the political direction within the people, and at the same time encourages the diversified development of literary and artistic forms and styles. This is completely consistent in spirit with Lenin's advocacy that literature should absolutely obey the leadership of the Party, and at the same time should ensure a vast space for thought and fantasy, form and content. This is Lenin's theory on the Party spirit of literature, on the development of Marxism, and on the development of proletarian culture, a creative development under the specific conditions of our country. As for the policy of weeding through the old to bring forth the new, it is to critically inherit the excellent heritage of national culture in accordance with the proletarian position, viewpoint, and method, so that they continue to play a positive role in the socialist era; at the same time, digest all the useful things in these heritages, so that the new socialist culture and new literature and art have a clear national form, and have a fresh, lively Chinese style and Chinese spirit that the masses love to see and hear. The policies of letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new have already played a huge role in real life, and will play an even greater role in the future.

An important issue now before us is to work hard and diligently to study. Study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong Thought, and at the same time continue to learn from the people, learn from all the useful things left by the predecessors, and learn from foreign progressive literature and art, especially all the advanced experiences of Soviet literature and art.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来，为争取文艺的更大丰收而奋斗！
    “文艺报”社论（摘要）
    文学艺术工作的伟大任务，就是以社会主义、共产主义精神来武装人民的头脑，帮助他们去掉旧社会遗留下来的资产阶级思想和其他非无产阶级的思想束缚，鼓起群众的冲天干劲，帮助群众同心同德、意气风发地推动历史前进。做到了这一步，就有助于大大地解放生产力，大大地促进我们新的经济基础、新的社会制度的巩固和发展；并且有助于人类的进步。如果要来衡量我们社会主义文学艺术的成绩和贡献，这才是最根本的一条。
    我们的文学艺术正在经历着一个伟大的革命性的变化；沿着“五四”以来、特别是延安文艺座谈会以来所开辟的道路，在新中国社会主义的土壤上产生了崭新的文学艺术，出现了社会主义文学艺术百花齐放的美景。不论从文艺和群众结合的广度和深度来看，从文艺队伍的改造、壮大和发展来看，从文艺成为各民族的事业、全民的事业、成为工农兵群众自己的事业来看，从文艺各个领域的普遍繁荣、迅速提高来看，从文学、电影、戏剧及其他优秀艺术作品在广大群众心灵中所发生的积极作用来看，可以毫不夸张地说，十年来的成就超过了“五四”以后的三十年。
    学习毛泽东思想，坚持毛泽东的文艺方向，这是取得胜利的最根本的保证。过去是这样，现在和今后仍然是这样。世界四分之一人口地区的人民民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，反复证明了毛泽东思想是战无不胜的马克思主义真理，是马克思列宁主义和中国实际相结合的最完整的体现和创造性的发展。毛泽东文艺思想是马克思列宁主义美学在新的历史条件下的系统化的体现，是马克思列宁主义美学的新发展。毛泽东同志根据他的著名的《实践论》《矛盾论》的哲学思想，从实际情况出发，系统而深刻地解决了文艺和革命、文艺和群众、文艺和生活的关系问题，辩证地解决了文艺的普及和提高、作家的主观和客观、革命文艺对于文化传统的批判和继承的关系问题。毛泽东同志根据正确处理人民内部矛盾的原理，提出了在战斗中发展马克思主义真理、发展社会主义文化的极端坚定的阶级政策，这就是“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。毛泽东同志提出了革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作原则，帮助我国文艺家们解放思想，开扩胸怀，站在比现实更高的地方来反映大跃进的新时代。毛泽东同志坚决反对洋八股、党八股，提倡准确、鲜明、生动的新文风，提倡文艺的民族形式，提倡新鲜活泼、为群众喜闻乐见的中国作风、中国气派，他自己的文章和演说就是这种新作风、新文风的最好的典范。除此而外，从延安时候直到新中国成立以后，他直接领导和指导文艺界进行了一系列的文学艺术上两条道路的斗争，帮助文艺界清除旧基地，解放生产力，开辟新道路。他的名著《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》及其他有关著作，是发展无产阶级新文化、新文艺的最系统的学说，同时是反对资产阶级文艺思想和反对文艺上的修正主义的最完整、最锐利的武器。文艺界同志们从切身经验深深地体会到，我们从延安文艺座谈会以来，特别是近十年来所取得的每一项重大胜利，都是同党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导和亲切指导分不开的。
    彻底改造作家艺术家的世界观，努力提高自己的革命世界观的水平，这在今天具有最迫切的意义。毛泽东同志在文艺思想上的最大贡献之一，就是根据《实践论》的哲学思想，针对我国文艺界的实际情况，指明了作家艺术家改造世界观的正确途径：作家艺术家可以经过学习马克思列宁主义，长期深入群众斗争，经过理论与实际的反复结合，经过知识分子与劳动群众的密切结合，实现从一个阶级到另一个阶级的思想转化。多年以来，文艺界同志们在这个思想的指导下，形成了良好的风气，很多同志以无产阶级党性的原则严格地要求自己，努力学习革命理论和党的政策，和工农兵群众打成一片，不断改造自己的主观世界，以便和客观世界的发展方向相一致。这样做，收到了很大效果。现在，文艺界的政治思想状况和解放前大不相同，作家艺术家的政治思想觉悟大大提高，新中国文学艺术的面貌为之一新。可是在这方面，我们是丝毫不能有自满情绪的。时代的变化太快了，新中国的舰队，在伟大舵手的操引下，一日千里地飞跃前进，如果我们缺乏不断革命的精神，我们的思想就会落后于现实。当前文学艺术的崇高使命，要求作家艺术家成为真诚的社会主义战士，党员作家艺术家更应成为坚定的、彻底的共产主义者，可是很多人没有达到这个要求。思想落后于现实以及不少人的资产阶级观点没有根本改变过来的状况，不能不在创作上和理论批评上反映出来。直到今天，还有不良的创作倾向有待于澄清，还有修正主义及其他各种谬论有待于批判，这是一点也不奇怪的。当然，文艺界的主流是健康的，正确的，生气勃勃的；尽管这样，每个文艺工作者都应该继续加强和劳动人民的联系，加紧学习，用不断革命论的精神加强自己的世界观，力争站在时代的最前列，用闪耀着思想光辉和革命火焰的新作品来鼓舞群众奔赴崇高的目标。
    我们应当学习毛泽东同志那样，把最冷静的科学分析和最热烈的革命精神结合起来，这样，才能正确地理解并掌握革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作原则，使我们的社会主义文学艺术迸发出更亮更强的光与热。这个创作原则，完全符合不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的学说；这个创作原则本身，就是共产主义者的革命精神和求实精神的结合、共产主义者的伟大理想和对于现实的深刻认识的结合在文学艺术上的体现；它要求文学艺术不只是描写现实的发展过程，并且推动现实的发展过程；不只是刻画人的性格和心灵，并且影响人的性格和心灵；不只是正确地反映今天，并且热情地展望明天；这样，文学艺术就要全力以赴地肯定社会主义的新事物，新性格，新风气，歌颂生活中间的共产主义萌芽，群众中间的共产主义风格；它也要严正地批判旧事物，其目的就是为新事物的发展开辟道路。这样的文艺，是充满革命干劲的文艺，所以能够转过来鼓足人们的革命干劲；是思想上最自由、最解放的文艺，所以能够转过来促进社会思想的解放、社会生产力的解放。早在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志就热望文艺家产生出“比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性”的作品，这样的文艺作品，“就能使人民群众惊醒起来，感奋起来，推动人民群众走向团结和斗争，实行改造自己的环境。”那么在今天，在这个充满了革命奇迹、革命理想的、全民意气风发地建设社会主义的新时代，强调地提出革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作原则，就更加是时代的要求了。只有这样，文学艺术才能和大跃进的时代脚步相一致，在新时代产生伟大的作用。在这方面，毛泽东同志的诗词，做出了最好的榜样。大跃进以来许多优秀的新民歌，也体现了革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的精神。近几年出现了一些引人注目的小说、电影、戏剧及其他优秀作品，也在不同程度上表现这种精神，开始获得了很好的效果。
    马克思主义是战斗的科学，我们也应当在战斗中来学习它。毛泽东同志的著作坚持和发展了马克思列宁主义学说的革命性、战斗性的特色，过去、现在和今后都是反对修正主义及各种资产阶级思想的最锐利的武器。文艺上的修正主义，是政治上哲学上的修正主义在文学艺术上的反映。它的主要表现是：宣扬资产阶级的人道主义、人性论、人类爱等腐朽观点来模糊阶级界限，反对阶级斗争；宣扬唯心主义来反对唯物主义；宣扬个人主义来反对集体主义；以“写真实”的幌子来否定文学艺术的教育作用；以“艺术即政治”的诡辩来反对文艺为政治服务；以“创作自由”的滥调来反对党和国家对文艺事业的领导。修正主义披着马克思列宁主义外衣，很有迷惑人的作用。建国以来，在党的领导下，文艺界针对着各色各样的资产阶级思想和文艺上的修正主义倾向，进行了一系列的斗争，给了这类反动思潮以毁灭性的打击。但是现代修正主义是一种国际现象，危害性很大。就国内来说，只要资产阶级的影响一天还存在，修正主义——在革命词句伪装下的资产阶级邪说，仍然会冒出头来。这就需要不断地斗争，不断地清扫。而这方面，毛泽东同志的著作就给了我们以极大的帮助。只要细读一下《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，不难发现，今天国内外许多修正主义者所翻弄的花样，很少能够逃过毛泽东同志当年挥起的十分锋利的思想批判的刀锋。
    修正主义者在文艺上，一方面宣传各种反动的、颓废的倾向，另一方面歪曲地利用过去时代的文化遗产，专门发扬其中的消极因素，以实现其用死人拖住活人、用资产阶级的世界观来抵制无产阶级的世界观、用过时的、旧的文学艺术教条来反对和扼杀无产阶级文学艺术的诡计。欧洲资产阶级文化史上，曾经产生过不少杰出的文学艺术作品，它们对人类文化有过重大贡献，并且今天和今后还是我们批判地学习、借鉴的重要对象。但是也应当看到，那毕竟是另一时代，另一阶级的文学艺术，而其中许多作品所散布的个人主义、无政府主义和悲观主义、感伤主义的思想情绪，和我们今天所要培养的共产主义道德，集体主义个性，断然是格格不入的。修正主义者拿欧洲古典作家的尸衣当做护身符，极力美化古典作品中的消极因素，在青年中散播有害的影响，这是值得注意的。冯雪峰、秦兆阳这些修正主义者力图抹煞批判的现实主义和社会主义现实主义的根本区别，唆使人们搬用古典作家暴露旧社会、批判旧制度的方法，转而来暴露新社会，批判新现实。直到今天，还有人墨守十九世纪的艺术标准，指望社会主义的文艺向着资产阶级的标准看齐，沿着资产阶级的方向提高。毛泽东同志早就指出过：“文学艺术中对于古人和外国人的毫无批判的硬搬和模仿，乃是最没有出息的最害人的文学教条主义和艺术教条主义。”我们反对修正主义的歪曲，也反对教条主义地硬搬和模仿。对于中国和外国的文化遗产，只能批判地继承，取其精华，弃其糟粕。批判的目的是为了更好地继承，继承的目的是为了革新和创造。没有正确的批判，就不可能正确地继承，也就不会有正确的革新和创造。无产阶级对于历史上遗留下来的文化遗产，既不是盲目地排斥，也不是盲目地崇拜；而是根据历史唯物主义的观点，采取科学分析的方法，给它们以正确的历史评价；既肯定它们应有的历史地位，也指出它们时代的、阶级的局限性；说明什么是应当向他们学习的，什么是应当清算或抛弃的。鉴于修正主义者和资产阶级学者对资产阶级文化遗产的极大歪曲，对于这些遗产的重新估价，就是不可回避的历史任务。这是一项长期的、艰巨的工作，我们应当坚定地、慎重地、细致地做好它。
    新的一年，我们要更高地举起无产阶级文化革命的旗帜，更好地实践百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新的方针。在我国，正在开展着一个声势浩大的文化革命运动。亿万群众参加了这个运动。劳动人民知识化，知识分子劳动化，就是这个运动的口号和目标。群众文化革命在文学艺术上的表现，就是工农群众大规模地、多方面地参加了文学艺术的创作活动，并且有越来越多的人参加了文艺批评的活动。这是最彻底的文艺工作的群众路线，也是最广泛的群众性的百花齐放、百家争鸣。展望新的一年，这种群众性的百花齐放、百家争鸣一定会开展得更加活跃，更加有声有色，对整个文艺界的百花齐放、百家争鸣发生巨大的推动作用。百花齐放、百家争鸣是在斗争中发展马克思主义真理、在竞赛中发展社会主义文化的革命方针，是最坚定的阶级政策。毛泽东同志说：“正确的东西总是在同错误的东西作斗争的过程中发展起来的。真的、善的、美的东西总是在同假的、恶的、丑的东西相比较而存在，相斗争而发展的。”而百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针正是按照真理发展的规律，坚持正面的东西，但也不怕反面的东西，大力促进正确的东西、真的、善的、美的东西在同反面的东西不断地竞赛和斗争中取得胜利。事实证明，这个方针同资产阶级的“自由化”毫无共同之点，并且恰好是打击修正主义及其他资产阶级思想的最锐利的武器。这个方针，首先坚持人民内部政治方向的一致性，同时鼓励文学艺术的形式与风格的多样化的发展。这和列宁主张的，文学应当绝对服从党的领导，同时应当保证思想和幻想、形式和内容的广大空间的学说，在精神上是完全一致的。这是列宁关于文学的党性的学说、关于发展马克思主义、关于发展无产阶级文化的学说在我国具体情况下的创造性的发展。至于推陈出新的方针，就是按照无产阶级的立场、观点和方法，批判地继承民族文化的优秀遗产，使它们在社会主义时代继续发生积极作用；同时把这些遗产中间的一切有用的东西加以消化，使社会主义的新文化、新文艺具有鲜明的民族形式，具有新鲜活泼、为群众喜闻乐见的中国作风、中国气派。百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新的方针，在实际生活中已经发生了巨大的作用，今后还将发生更巨大的作用。
    现在摆在我们面前的一个重要问题，是努力地、勤奋地学习。学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东思想，同时继续向人民学习，向前人留下的一切有用的东西学习，向外国进步文艺，特别是苏联文艺的一切先进经验学习。　（原载“文艺报”1960年第一期）
