Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 9th - Tianjin’s districts, targeting the characteristics of street residents, have adopted flexible and diverse methods to conduct literacy campaigns and spare-time education, cultivating a large number of educated workers and technical personnel for factories and enterprises. At the same time, they have raised residents' socialist consciousness and fostered a new social atmosphere.

During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, 123,000 street residents in Tianjin shook off illiteracy. Since the spring of 1959, more than 13,000 street residents have been further eliminated from illiteracy. A large number of residents are now studying in literacy classes, consolidation classes, spare-time primary schools, and spare-time middle schools. Residents in many districts, streets, and communities throughout the city have persisted in regular study, maintaining stable enrollment and attendance rates. For example, in Nankai and Hongqiao districts, the enrollment rate of residents has consistently remained above 80% of the number of people who should be enrolled, and the attendance rate has accounted for about 75%. After August, the enrollment rate of residents in the two districts further increased to over 93%. Recently, in Nankai, Hongqiao, and Heping districts, non-illiterates have accounted for more than 85% of the total number of young and middle-aged residents. On this basis, a new upsurge in running residents' spare-time education has been launched.

In response to the specific circumstances of street residents, Tianjin has adopted a combination of centralized and decentralized methods for literacy campaigns. For residents who have already participated in street industries, service industries, production and work, centralized learning methods have been adopted; workshops are transformed into classrooms, and a workshop is a learning class. The group leaders and directors of the workshops are both responsible for production and for learning; they ensure the completion of production tasks, guarantee the attendance of students, and help students solve difficulties in learning. Employees with higher levels of education in the workshops serve as part-time teachers, and full-time teachers from the district provide key tutoring. This method of organizing learning results in high student attendance rates, rapid elimination of illiteracy, and significant learning achievements due to the concentration of students, sound organizational leadership, and guaranteed time.

For some housewives who have household chores and are burdened by children and have not participated in production, the districts have adopted methods such as dividing groups by residential neighborhoods, using methods such as contracted teaching and learning, and delivering literacy to their doorsteps to organize them to learn. Hongqiao District organized cultural and educational cadres and literacy activists to conduct special investigations and research on the learning situation of illiterate people, and found that housewives have "four major difficulties" in learning (cold weather, hot weather, Spring Festival, and epidemic diseases). They then put forward the slogan "Break through the four difficulties" and "Persist in year-round learning" to the masses. When it is cold, large groups are divided into small groups to ensure that they can learn without leaving the courtyard; when it is hot, learning is organized early in the morning when it is cool; if they are too busy disassembling and making cotton clothes, the sewing workshops of the production service cooperatives and the "winter literacy mutual aid groups" organized by the masses will help solve the problem; when it comes to the New Year and festivals, they will take holidays in advance, start school on time, and quickly resume normal learning. All possible ways are explored to help them overcome the difficulties in learning. Many literacy activists also take the initiative to help the masses take care of their children and do housework.

In carrying out spare-time education, Tianjin's districts and streets have also promptly paid attention to consolidation and improvement in order to meet the needs of more than 100,000 residents who have participated in street industries, service industries, and health care work. At present, many districts and streets throughout the city have established regular spare-time schools jointly run by streets and communities. Some districts have also established "three-in-one" schools of politics, culture, and technology, studying politics once a week, technology once, and culture four times.

Because the political, cultural, and technical level of the students has been improved, the development of street industrial production has been strongly promoted. The street system of Nankai District has overfulfilled its production plan every month, and overfulfilled last year's output value task 62 days ahead of schedule. Street industries and service industries alone received nearly 20,000 rationalization proposals from community members in the whole district in August and September of last year. With the improvement of cultural level, their horizons have broadened, and their mental outlook has also changed. Now, reading books, newspapers, studying current affairs, and writing poetry and prose have become a common practice among residents; many housewives understand the knowledge of educating children and no longer beat or scold them; some housewives also regularly check their children's grade books and homework books, and write letters to school teachers to reflect their children's extracurricular learning. Because everyone learns together, the neighborhood is more united and harmonious.

The Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal People's Committee, and the leading party and government organs at all levels attach great importance to residents' literacy and spare-time education. According to the new situation of the increasing number of residents participating in street production, they repeatedly implemented the spirit of "taking production as the center, grasping production with one hand and education with the other," and established and improved the leading organizations of worker-peasant education at all levels. Many streets have been equipped with special personnel to manage residents' cultural and educational work, and have given full play to the role of the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation and other organizations. With the development of residents' cultural and educational work, districts, streets, and communities have fixed a group of full-time and part-time teachers. In order to improve the cultural and professional level of teachers, some districts have selected a group of teachers to study at the district's worker-peasant normal schools, and many streets have also held teacher training classes and regularly carry out teaching research activities to improve teaching quality.

    针对居民特点，采取集中和分散相结合的方法
    天津在街道中扫除大批文盲
    培养了新的社会风气　促进了街道工业的发展
    新华社天津9日电　天津市各区针对街道居民的特点，采取灵活多样的方式举办扫盲和业余教育，为工厂企业等培养了大批有文化的劳动者和技术人材。同时，提高了居民社会主义觉悟，培养了新的社会风气。
    1958年大跃进中，天津市有十二万三千名街道居民摆脱文盲状态。1959年春天以来，又继续扫除了街道居民文盲一万三千多人。现有大批居民分别在扫盲班、巩固班、业余小学、业余中学学习。全市许多区、街、社居民都坚持了经常学习，入学率与出席率保持了稳定状态。例如：南开区和红桥区居民入学率始终保持在应该入学人数的80％以上，出席率占75％左右。8月以后，两个区的居民入学率进一步提高到93％以上。最近，南开、红桥、和平三个区非文盲已占青壮年居民总数的85％以上，在这个基础上又掀起了大办居民业余教育的高潮。
    针对街道居民的具体情况，天津市采取了集中和分散相结合的方法扫盲。对于已经参加街道工业、服务行业生产和工作的居民采取了集中学习的方法；变车间为课堂，一个车间就是一个学习班。车间的组长和主任是生产的负责人也是学习的负责人；既保证生产任务的完成，又保证学员出席人数和帮助学员解决学习中的困难。由车间文化程度高的职工担任兼职教师，区设的专职教师作重点辅导。这样组织学习，由于学员集中、组织领导健全，时间有保证，所以学员出席率高，脱盲时间快，学习成绩显著。
    对于一些有家务、孩子拖累没有参加生产的家庭妇女，各区采取了以居住里巷划分小组，用包教包学、送字上门等方式组织她们学习。红桥区组织文教干部和扫盲积极分子，对文盲学习情况作了专门调查研究，发现家庭妇女在学习上有“四大难关”（天寒关、天热关、春节关、流行疾病关），随即向群众提出“闯四关”“坚持常年学习”的口号，天冷时划大组为小组，保证不出院就能学习；天热时趁早晨凉快组织学习；拆做棉衣忙不过来的，就由生产服务社的缝纫车间和群众组织的“冬季扫盲互助组”帮助解决；到了过年过节的时候，就提前放假，按时开学，迅速恢复正常学习。想尽一切办法，协助她们攻克了学习上的难关。很多扫盲积极分子还主动帮助群众看孩子、料理家务。
    天津市各区、街在开展业余教育中，还及时注意了巩固与提高，以适应全市已有十多万居民参加了街道工业、服务行业和卫生保育工作的需要。目前，全市许多区、街建立了正规的街、社合办的业余学校。有的区还举办了政治、文化、技术“三合一”学校，每周学习一次政治、一次技术、四次文化。
    由于提高了学员的政治、文化、技术水平，有力地促进了街道工业生产的发展，南开区街道系统生产计划月月超额完成，并提前六十二天超额完成去年产值任务。街道工业、服务行业仅在去年8、9月全区居民社员提出合理化建议近两万件。随着文化水平的提高，他们的眼界宽阔，精神面貌也发生了变化。现在在居民中，看书、读报、学习时事、写作诗文已经形成风气；很多家庭妇女懂得了教育儿童的知识，不再打骂儿童；有些家庭妇女还经常检查孩子记分册、作业本，给学校教师写信反映子女课外学习情况。由于大家在一起学习，邻里之间更加团结和睦。
    天津市委、市人民委员会和各级党政领导机关十分重视居民扫盲和业余教育。根据居民参加街道生产日益增多的新情况，反复贯彻“以生产为中心，一手抓生产，一手抓教育”的精神，建立和健全了各级工农教育的领导组织机构，不少街配备了专人管理居民文化教育工作，并充分发挥共青团、妇联等组织的作用。随着居民文化教育工作的开展，各区、街、社都固定了一批专职、兼职教师。为了提高教师的文化、业务水平，有的区选送了一批教师到区工农师范进修，有不少的街道还举办了师资训练班，经常开展教学研究活动，以提高教学质量。（附图片）
