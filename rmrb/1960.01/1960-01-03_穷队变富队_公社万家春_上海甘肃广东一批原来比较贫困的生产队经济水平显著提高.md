    Poor Teams Become Rich Teams: Ten Thousand Families in Communes Enjoy Spring
    A Batch of Previously Impoverished Production Teams in Shanghai, Gansu, and Guangdong Achieve Significant Economic Improvement
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 1st: Within just one year after communization, 70% of the previously impoverished production teams in the rural areas of Shanghai have caught up with the economic level of rich teams or average teams.
    After liberation, through the mutual aid and cooperation movement, production in the suburbs of Shanghai developed year by year, and the rural landscape has changed. At the time of the establishment of the People's Communes, there were 442 poor teams out of 2,686 production teams. One year after communization, more than 300 of the 400-plus poor teams have caught up with the rich teams or the economic level of average teams. The income of the remaining few poor teams is also increasing significantly.
    As soon as the communes in the suburbs of the city were established, the commune Party committees comprehensively studied the reasons for the poverty of the poor teams, formulated plans to change the face of the poor teams, and sent experienced cadres or work groups to strengthen the leadership of these teams. For teams with weak foundations and barren land, the commune provided funds, increased the allocation of commercial fertilizers, or established large-scale livestock farms in these teams to supply farmyard manure nearby. When the commune uniformly planned crop planting plans, it assigned poor teams to plant more vegetables, melons, fruits and other tasks with greater returns. The commune's nurseries, fish farms, hatcheries, and breeding farms also continuously supplied poor teams with fruit seedlings, poultry and livestock seedlings, and fish fry. With the support of the commune and the poor teams' own efforts to be diligent and frugal, the income of the poor teams in the suburbs of Shanghai doubled in 1959. The Jinquan Production Team of Chengxi Commune in Jiading County was the poorest team in the entire commune. In 1959, the per-mu yield of rice increased by 50% compared with 1958, and the number of pigs raised more than doubled.
    For some poor teams with insufficient labor, the commune purchased large-scale agricultural machinery to plow the land for them and install water pumps for them. The farm tool factory established by the commune also gave priority to supplying various farm tools to the poor teams. In addition, the members of the poor teams increased their attendance, leaving early and returning late, with more labor engaged in intensive farming and diversified operations, which significantly improved the level of production.
    In the vigorous development of small-scale water conservancy, each commune organized labor to help poor teams open rivers and dig canals according to the principle of equal value exchange, which improved the ability of these teams to resist natural disasters.
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, January 1st: In the year 1959, 2,145 poor teams in the People's Communes of Gansu Province jumped into the ranks of rich teams.
    These poor teams accounted for 71% of the total number of poor teams in the People's Communes of Gansu Province. Most of them were located in mountainous areas with relatively serious soil erosion, and the yields of crops were very low in the past. After communization, these poor teams, under the unified leadership and assistance of the People's Communes, made ambitious goals, vigorously engaged in farmland capital construction centered on water conservancy, and ensured a bumper harvest of crops in 1959. The 218 poor teams in the arid mountainous area of ​​Wudu County, relying on the People's Commune to carry out large-scale labor cooperation under the principle of equal value exchange, vigorously engaged in water conservancy construction, soil and water conservation, and farmland terracing, have basically controlled soil erosion and achieved a great harvest of grain. The income in 1959 generally increased by 70% to 100% compared with 1958.
    The People's Communes in various places also helped poor teams to take grain as the key and comprehensively develop diversified operations, expand production, and increase income. The Miaotouya Production Team of Xidao Commune in Qingyang County was previously weak in manpower and material resources and unable to engage in diversified operations. In 1959, thanks to the commune's multi-faceted support and assistance, it vigorously engaged in diversified operations and achieved an all-round great leap forward in industry, agriculture, animal husbandry and other production.
    In changing the face of poor teams, Party committees in various places dispatched a large number of cadres to help poor teams strengthen leadership. Many county Party committees and commune Party committees also held regular discussions, frequent inspections, and held on-site meetings for poor teams to catch up with rich teams to encourage poor teams to strive to quickly change their appearance.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: The People's Communes in various parts of Guangdong have demonstrated incomparable superiority in changing the face of rural areas and guiding farmers towards common prosperity. In just one year, about 30% of the province's more than 7,000 "poor teams" have caught up with or surpassed the local rich teams; the production outlook and income of the commune members of the poor teams that have not yet caught up with the rich teams have also undergone tremendous changes, and the difference with the rich teams is getting smaller and smaller.
    After the establishment of the People's Communes in various places, they gave play to the superiority of being large in size and having a high degree of public ownership, organized large-scale cooperation, and helped the "poor teams" to carry out large-scale farmland capital construction, fundamentally changing the long-term backward production situation of the "poor teams". In order to help poor teams get rid of poverty, the People's Communes in various places have also tried their best to open up production channels for these "poor teams" so that agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishery and industry can be fully developed and increase income. The People's Communes in various places also withdrew part of the funds from public accumulation to vigorously help the "poor teams". Under the support of the commune, the Tian'an Brigade of Dasi Zhuang Autonomous Commune in Qin County built the Nalang Reservoir, which fundamentally eliminated drought. At the same time, it opened up more than 20 diversified operations, and its income increased greatly. It removed the label of "poor team" in one fell swoop.
    In order to quickly change the face of the "poor teams", the People's Communes in various places not only provided economic support but also helped the poor teams strengthen political leadership. According to statistics, in 27 communes in Huaxian, Huiyang and Shunde areas alone, four commune Party committee secretaries, 44 Party committee members, and 77 commune cadres were sent to 146 "poor teams" to serve as general branch secretaries, brigade leaders, or stay there for a long time to help with their work.

    穷队变富队　公社万家春
    上海甘肃广东一批原来比较贫困的生产队经济水平显著提高
    据新华社上海1日电　在公社化后的短短一年内，上海市郊农村原来比较贫困的生产队中，已有70％的队赶上了富队或一般队的经济水平。
    解放后，上海市郊经过互助合作运动，生产逐年发展，农村面貌已经改变。人民公社成立时，二千六百八十六个生产队中有四百四十二个穷队。公社化一年后，四百多个穷队中，已经有三百多个赶上了富队，或一般队的经济水平。剩下的少数穷队，收入也在大幅度地增长。
    市郊各公社一成立，公社党委对穷队贫困的原因作了全面研究，制订改变穷队面貌的规划，并派出有经验的干部或工作组加强这些队的领导，对家底薄、土地贫瘠的队，公社贷给资金，增调商品肥料，或在这些队里建立大型畜牧场就近供应厩肥。公社在统一规划作物种植计划时，分配穷队多种蔬菜瓜果等收益较大的任务。公社的苗圃、鱼种场、孵房、种畜场也不断供给穷队果树苗、苗禽苗畜和鱼种。在公社支援和穷队自己克勤克俭的努力下，上海市郊的穷队1959年的收入成倍增加。嘉定县城西公社金圈生产队，是全公社最穷的一个队，1959年水稻亩产量比1958年增长50％，养猪量翻了一番多。
    有一部分劳动力不足的穷队，公社购买了大型农业机械，为他们翻地，为他们装置抽水机。公社兴办的农具厂也尽先供应穷队各种农具，加上穷队社员增加出勤，早出晚归，有更多的劳力从事精耕细作、发展多种经营，使生产水平显著提高。
    在大兴小型水利中，各公社根据等价交换的原则，组织劳动帮助穷队开河挖渠，提高了这些队抗击自然灾害的能力。
    据新华社兰州1日电　1959年一年中，甘肃省人民公社二千一百四十五个穷队跃入了富队行列。
    这些穷队占甘肃省各人民公社穷队总数的71％，它们大多处于山区，水土流失相当严重，过去农作物产量很低。公社化以后，这些穷队在人民公社的统一领导和帮助下，立下雄心大志，大搞以兴修水利为中心的农田基本建设，保证了1959年农作物获得丰收。武都县干旱山区的二百一十八个穷队，依靠人民公社在等价交换的原则下，开展劳力大协作，大搞水利建设、水土保持和农田园田化，已经基本上控制了水土流失，获得粮食大丰收，1959年的收入普遍比1958年增加七成到一倍。
    各地人民公社还帮助穷队以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营，扩大生产，增加收入。庆阳县西岛公社庙头呀生产队，过去人力物力单薄，无力搞多种经营。1959年由于公社多方面的支援和帮助，大搞多种经营，获得了工、农、牧等各项生产的全面大跃进。
    在改变穷队面貌中，各地党委抽派了大批干部，帮助穷队加强领导。许多县委和公社党委，还定期讨论，经常检查，并举行穷队赶富队的现场会，鼓舞穷队力争迅速改变面貌的干劲。
    据新华社广州电　广东各地人民公社在改变农村面貌、引导农民走向共同富裕的道路上，显示了巨大无比的优越性。在短短一年间，全省七千多个“穷队”中，已经有30％左右赶上或者超过了当地的富队；暂时没有赶上富队的穷队，生产面貌和社员收入的情况，也起了巨大变化，和富队的差别越来越小了。
    各地人民公社成立后，发挥一大二公的优越性，组织大协作，帮助“穷队”作了大规模的农田基本建设，从根本上改变了“穷队”生产长期落后的情况。为了帮助穷队摆脱穷困，各地人民公社还千方百计地帮助这些“穷队”广辟生产门路，使农、林、牧、副、渔和工业全面发展，增加收入。各地人民公社还从公共积累中抽出部分资金，大力帮助“穷队”。钦县大寺僮族公社天安大队在公社的支援下，兴建了那琅大水库，根本解除了旱患，同时开辟了二十多项多种经营门路，收入大大增加，一举摘掉了“穷队”的帽子。
    各地人民公社为了迅速改变“穷队”面貌，不但在经济上支援，还帮助穷队加强政治领导。据统计，仅花县、惠阳以及顺德地区的二十七个公社，就派出了公社党委书记四人，党委委员四十四人，公社干部七十七人，到一百四十六个“穷队”当总支书记、大队长，或者长期驻在那里帮助工作。（附图片）
    为了迅速把穷队变成富队，四川江油石岭公社第七管理区的社员们，人人干劲冲天。这是他们在开渠道，决心把旱地变为水田。
