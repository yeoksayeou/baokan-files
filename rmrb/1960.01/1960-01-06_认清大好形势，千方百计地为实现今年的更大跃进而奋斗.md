    Recognize the Excellent Situation and Do Everything Possible to Strive for a Greater Leap Forward This Year
    Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    1959 was the second year of the continued Great Leap Forward. In this year, all production fronts in Anhui Province have completed and overfulfilled the national plan, achieving even greater victories. In terms of industrial production: the output of "native steel" increased more than five times compared to the extraordinary Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the output of "native iron" increased more than three times, and coal output increased by 85%; the total industrial output value increased by 54%, once again achieving an extraordinary Great Leap Forward. In terms of agricultural production, although it suffered from an unprecedented severe drought, it still achieved a higher output than the extraordinary Great Leap Forward year of 1958, with the total agricultural output value increasing by 16.5%, achieving a Great Leap Forward; this Great Leap Forward in the context of such a severe drought is, in fact, a historic miracle.
    Now, 1959 has passed, and 1960 has arrived. Looking forward to the new year, what kind of year will it be – a leap forward, a Great Leap Forward, or an extraordinary Great Leap Forward? How can we achieve a greater and better leap forward? This is the issue that everyone is most concerned about and urgently needs to be answered.
    Favorable Conditions for Achieving a Greater Leap Forward This Year
    Based on the standards of a leap forward, Great Leap Forward, and extraordinary Great Leap Forward, and considering the current favorable situation, we can affirm that 1960 will still be a year of continued Great Leap Forward, and may even be a year of comprehensive Great Leap Forward or extraordinary Great Leap Forward. This is because we have a general line for socialist construction that has been proven correct through practice, a labor force with greatly improved political and ideological awareness and technical skills, increasingly consolidated and healthy people's communes, rich experience from two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, and a more solid material foundation than ever before, and so on. These are all favorable conditions and strong guarantees for achieving a continued Great Leap Forward this year.
    However, those with right-leaning ideas have a different view. They believe: "After two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, the base figure is large, the potential is insufficient, there are not many methods, and the labor force is already very tight." Their conclusion is: "This year, it is impossible to continue the Great Leap Forward, and even a leap forward is impossible." This view is obviously wrong.
    Whether a Great Leap Forward can be achieved after the base figure has increased is a question worth studying. After the base figure increases, there is indeed a certain limiting effect on the continued increase in the rate of production growth. However, in the current situation, this limiting effect is negligible. We believe that although the base figure is large, we can still continue the Great Leap Forward.
    This is because the potential is not insufficient, but is becoming greater and greater. The so-called potential is the latent power for developing production. Potential can be roughly divided into two types: one is temporarily unexploitable, and the other is currently exploitable. The former is inexhaustible and the latter also constantly increases with the development of production. The increase in the base figure precisely indicates an increase in potential, because a larger base figure means a stronger material force and greater improvements in production technology, which expands and enhances our ability to exploit potential. With greater potential, the capacity for increasing production will inevitably increase. As to whether a Great Leap Forward can be achieved, it depends on the size of the production growth rate resulting from the exploited potential. For example, in industry, if the exploited potential can increase industrial production by more than 25%, it is considered a Great Leap Forward; in agriculture, if it can increase agricultural production by more than 15%, it is also considered a Great Leap Forward. From the existing potential in Anhui Province, it is fully qualified to meet the above conditions. Taking steel production as an example, before August 1958, there were no three-ton steelmaking converters, but now 51 have been established; in the past, only seven furnaces of steel were smelted per day, but now 35 furnaces can be smelted per day, and the pass rate has also greatly improved. With this foundation, this year's steel production can have a huge increase compared to 1959. Taking grain production as another example, this year the sown area of ​​grain and the area for improved seed promotion will be expanded, and this year's water storage capacity and fertilizer will also be increased, coupled with other favorable conditions, so that this year's grain production can continue the Great Leap Forward. Of course, the existing production potential is not limited to these; these are what can be seen, and some are still invisible. These invisible potentials must be thought about, calculated, and exploited in every possible way. Otherwise, no matter how great the potential is, it cannot play its role. The people have a good metaphor for the potential being exploited more and more, they say: "Potential is like groundwater, the deeper the well is dug, the more water there is. Don't be afraid of the well being deep, be afraid that people won't dig." Therefore, as long as we use our brains, find more tricks, and improve the level of science and technology, not only can the existing production potential be fully used, but also the infinite potential hidden in nature will be continuously exploited.
    This is because the methods are not fewer, but more and more. The so-called method is a production measure, which is created from practice. The more experience people have, the deeper their understanding of objective laws, the more methods they have. Engels once said in "Dialectics of Nature": "With the rapid increase in knowledge of natural laws, the means by which man reacts on nature also increases." The Chinese proverb "Learn from experience" is also the same principle. After two years of the great practice of the Great Leap Forward, with the rapid development of production and the rapid improvement of technology, our experience is richer than in the past, and our methods are more substantial than in the past. This is most evident from the endless stream of technological innovation deeds and the large number of high-yield examples in Anhui Province in the past year. According to incomplete statistics in 1959, more than 167,400 innovation projects have been implemented in the industrial sector; more than 18,000 types of advanced tools have been created and modified in rural areas; and many valuable things have also been created, such as houses that do not use wood or steel, silicon steel that Anhui Province has never produced before is smelted without electric furnaces, insulated biogas digesters that can normally produce biogas even in winter, and windmills that can drive steel mills with only level 2.5 winds, and so on. In terms of cultivation, a set of high-yield methods for rice, wheat, and cotton has been created, achieving higher yields of early rice than medium rice, higher yields of late rice than early rice, and high yields of wheat and cotton over large areas; many new methods have also been created for the application of the Eight-Character Charter, and taking fertilizer accumulation as an example, it has been further developed from the original ten-character formula for fertilizer accumulation (burning, smoking, digging, exchanging, sweeping, composting, shoveling, piling, picking up, and撈) into a more effective and complete method that focuses on animal husbandry, combining animal husbandry, seed production, accumulation, and systemization. These facts further illustrate that the wisdom of the masses is infinite. As long as we go deep among the masses and learn from the masses, we can summarize experience and find more and better methods. Those who shout that "there are not many methods" only show that they are unwilling to go deep into reality and their thinking is rigid!
    This is because the labor enthusiasm of the masses is better combined with technological innovation, and the labor force is not becoming more and more tight, but is gradually tending to ease. To engage in the Great Leap Forward, one cannot rely solely on physical strength, but more importantly on intelligence. Physical strength is limited, but wisdom is infinite. As long as we combine the masses' soaring enthusiasm with their tenacious dedication, and combine labor enthusiasm with technological innovation, we can give greater play to the role of the labor force. Many places have achieved increased production without increasing manpower, or even increased production with reduced manpower, due to large-scale technological innovation, large-scale tool reform, and large-scale mass movements with high labor efficiency. From the current situation in the province, the tense labor situation will continue to ease down. On the industrial front, a total of 1.13 million laborers were put into production in 1958, and 360,000 laborers were reduced in 1959. Not only did production not decrease, but it rose linearly. With last year's foundation, the situation this year will be even better. The water conservancy construction since last winter is also sufficient to illustrate this trend. According to statistics from late December last year, the average work efficiency was more than ten cubic meters, an increase of more than three times compared to 1957, when large-scale water conservancy construction was carried out. The cumulative progress of the project was 1.725 billion cubic meters, an increase of 72% compared to the same period in 1957. However, the labor force used was 53% less than in the same period in 1957. At present, a mass movement to carry out large-scale technological innovation, save labor, and improve work efficiency is being carried out vigorously throughout the province. As long as this movement is continued and advanced experiences are widely promoted, production efficiency will be further improved, and the tense labor situation will inevitably be greatly improved.
    From the above analysis, it can be clearly seen that whether or not to continue the Great Leap Forward does not depend on the size of the base figure, but on both objective and subjective conditions. When the objective conditions are already available, the key lies in subjective effort. If we adopt the attitude of a lazy man and a coward and do not go all out to strive for the top, then even if the base figure is small and the conditions are good, we cannot achieve a Great Leap Forward. If we have soaring enthusiasm and constantly study, even if the base figure increases, we can continue the Great Leap Forward. Those who believe that the base figure is too large to achieve a Great Leap Forward are actually lacking in enthusiasm and dedication themselves, so they cannot see the objective favorable conditions or the subjective dynamic role. Obviously, this view is inconsistent with the facts. We should recognize the current excellent situation, strengthen subjective efforts, fully utilize and give play to all favorable conditions, and strive with full confidence to achieve a greater leap forward this year.
    Do Everything Possible to Improve Labor Productivity
    The problem now is that Anhui Province's labor productivity is still not high, and it is far behind advanced areas. Taking the machinery manufacturing industry as an example, due to the large number of apprentices and the low level of proficiency, labor productivity is almost half that of Shanghai. Therefore, the direction of our efforts is to improve labor productivity. Only in this way can we fully reduce the payment of the labor force, reduce the consumption of raw materials, reduce costs, improve quality, and give play to the role of human, material, and financial resources; can we free up more human, material, and financial resources in all walks of life and in all production units for the purpose of increasing new enterprises, expanding capital construction, and achieving a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry. On the contrary, if we only rely on increasing the quantity of the labor force and increasing labor intensity to increase production, it will affect the continued and comprehensive leap forward of production. Therefore, in all work, we must do everything possible to improve labor productivity. According to past experience, especially the experience since the Great Leap Forward, to achieve this requirement, we must make efforts in the following aspects.
     I. We Must Find Measures that Require Little Effort and Increase Production Greatly
    In production and construction, all strategic and tactical measures must meet the requirements of "little effort and large increase in production." Only in this way can we make greater and better achievements with the existing human and material resources, and can we win high-speed development. This is an experience we have gained in the struggle with nature, and it is also a shortcut to building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. The facts of the past few years have fully proven that acting according to this requirement has very significant results. In the spring of 1958, Anhui Province put forward the principle of "trusting the masses, relying on the masses, focusing on small-scale projects, supporting large and medium-sized projects, focusing on water storage, minimizing drainage, river networkization, and rice cultivation" in terms of water management and crop changes. As a result, less money was spent, more projects were completed, thus greatly accelerating the progress of water conservancy construction and ensuring the high-speed development of agricultural production. During the large-scale steelmaking campaign in the winter of 1958, we put forward the principle of focusing on small-scale native steelmaking groups on the basis of combining native and foreign methods. This not only saved labor and raw materials, but also had good quality and high efficiency, thus overfulfilling the steel production task and laying a solid foundation for the continued great development of steel production.
    The basic requirement of "little effort and large increase in production" remains unchanged, but the specific measures to achieve this requirement are constantly enriched and developed with the changes in objective conditions and the improvement of subjective understanding. Last September, in accordance with this spirit, we summed up the experience of the Great Leap Forward in the past two years and tentatively proposed a series of key production-increasing measures for industrial and agricultural production in 1960. In agriculture: on the original basis, measures were proposed to expand the spring planting area, accelerate the expansion of the area for changing crops to rice, completely switch to improved seeds, and reclaim 7.5 million mu of wasteland. This is a further development compared to the past when we simply proposed to increase the proportion of summer harvests, expand the area of ​​double-cropping, generally propose rice changes, and adopt improved seeds. Experience has shown that the yield of spring-sown crops is 30% to 50% higher than that of wheat stubble crops; reclaiming wasteland seems to require more labor, but because the wasteland reclaimed last winter can be sown this spring without fertilizer, it actually saves labor; changing dry land to rice cultivation can definitely increase production by 100 to 200 jin per mu; and switching to improved seeds is an even simpler and more effective production-increasing measure. Taking rice as an example, improved seeds can increase production by 20% to 80% compared to ordinary varieties. As long as these measures are grasped well, agricultural production this year may have a greater leap forward. In industry: according to the current conditions, we have proposed to vigorously develop small-scale native fertilizer production groups and produce a large number of simple machines in terms of supporting rural areas; in the metallurgical industry, we have proposed to develop from "small-scale native steelmaking groups" to "medium-scale native steelmaking groups" and to vigorously develop sintered ore; in transportation, we have proposed to vigorously develop native railways and to vigorously develop water transportation in conjunction with water conservancy construction; in coal mining, we have proposed various methods for saving pit props. These are all one step further than last year. For example, vigorously developing sintered ore can save a lot of labor because there is a lot of powdered ore, which is easy to mine, and it has a large iron output, a low coke ratio, and can also improve quality and reduce costs, which is a win-win solution. Vigorously developing native railways can use local materials, and it is simple, easy to implement, quick to produce results, and has a large carrying capacity; combining water conservancy construction with the development of water transport is a win-win solution, which can achieve twice the result with half the effort.
    Such strategic and tactical measures exist not only at the provincial level, but also in every factory, mine, workshop, construction site, commune, and production team. The question is how to find them. Therefore, all regions, all departments, and all production units must, in accordance with this spirit, find a set of practical and feasible production-increasing measures in a realistic manner according to their own circumstances, their own characteristics, and their own experiences. In this way, we can greatly save labor input, generally improve labor productivity, and thus ensure the completion of the province's tasks.
    II. We Must Make a Layout That Greatly Saves Labor
    In production and construction, paying attention to rational layout is of great significance for improving labor productivity. A good layout can facilitate the transportation of raw materials and products, greatly saving unnecessary labor costs; can speed up the construction speed and reduce investment in capital construction; and can fully utilize natural resources and ensure the normal development of production. The important reason why Anhui Province achieved greater industrial output value with less labor in 1959 than in 1958 is because it carried out a rational layout of industry. However, some places are not doing enough. Moreover, some people believe that industry needs to pay attention to layout, but agriculture does not. This idea must be corrected. We must earnestly implement this spirit in all aspects and in every production unit, so that all production units can make a rational layout of the establishment of bases, the arrangement of labor, and the connection between various links in accordance with this requirement.
    In the layout, we must determine the establishment of bases according to the principles of proximity to raw materials and proximity to needs. In industry, production units should be as close as possible to raw material producing areas and consumption areas to shorten transportation distances. Within the enterprise, various parts and workshops must also be properly arranged so that various processes are closely coordinated and production runs normally. In agriculture, we must also pay attention to the layout of basic construction. For example, building field cellars, accumulating fertilizer on the spot, and applying fertilizer on the spot, unifying fertilizer accumulation and application, can reduce round-trip transportation. Another example is building pigsties in the fields, which is convenient for sending pig manure to the fields, which is also a labor-saving method. It is best to combine pig farms, biogas stations, and agricultural and sideline product processing plants. Using pig manure and weeds to produce biogas as fuel can not only use biogas to process agricultural and sideline products and process feed, but also improve fertilizer efficiency, and the leftover agricultural and sideline products can be used as pig concentrate feed. This is the most cost-effective method. There are many such tricks in every production link, and we must study them specifically according to different situations and make the most labor-saving layout.
    In the layout, we must rationally arrange the labor force. Here, we need to pay attention to the following issues: First, every regular production industry and unit must establish a professional team and fully implement the system of fixed output, fixed quality, and fixed personnel. Second, various professional teams and various processes must vigorously organize cooperation between each other, using idle labor to help busy labor, using more labor to help less labor, and using strong labor to help weak labor, without affecting normal production. Third, organize urban labor to support rural areas. Between the summer and autumn of last year, Anhui Province mobilized more than 1.1 million cadres from agencies, officers and soldiers, employees of factories, mines, and shops, and urban residents to go to the countryside to support agricultural production, completing a total of more than 92.6 million workdays, which played an important role in fighting disasters and increasing production, strengthening grassroots work, supporting poor teams, and strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses and between urban and rural areas. This method should continue to be adopted if possible.
    In the layout, we must pay attention to strengthening weak links. The national economy is an organic whole, and various departments restrict and promote each other. If some links cannot keep up, it will affect the overall situation and hinder the improvement of production. Therefore, we must seize the weak links and make them catch up quickly. From the current situation in the province, the main problems in industry are insufficient electricity, incomplete material varieties, and tight transportation. We must adopt the method of self-reliance as the main method, focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises, and combining native and foreign methods to quickly change this situation. In terms of various industrial systems, there are also individual backward departments with low output and poor quality. We must, in light of the specific circumstances of these departments, boldly mobilize the masses to change the backward situation. In rural areas, there are individual counties and a small number of communes and teams whose work is relatively backward and whose production development is slow. We must vigorously strengthen the leadership of these areas and fully tap the strong potential of these places so that they can quickly catch up with high-yield areas and no longer cause dragging. In short, the responsibility of the leadership lies in grasping both the advanced and the backward, so that the backward can catch up with the advanced. In this way, in a cycle, the labor productivity of the entire region, the entire industry, and the entire enterprise will continue to rise.
    III. We Must Vigorously Carry Out Technological Innovation
    Continuous technological innovation is the central link to comprehensively ensure the improvement of labor productivity. Because only in this way can we save labor, reduce labor intensity, save raw materials, enhance the ability to tap natural potential, achieve high yield and high quality, and ensure production safety. Therefore, technological innovation is the fundamental way to ensure the normal development of the Great Leap Forward.
    In the past two years, the mass technological innovation movement in Anhui Province has achieved great success. Facts have proven that the better the technological innovation is done in a region, industry, or unit, the greater the production achievements are and the faster the construction and development are. For example, Anhui Province's steel industry has been focusing on technological innovation, so the increase in output and quality has been relatively fast, and the production of special steel has been initially resolved. Due to the widespread use of tool reforms in Anhui Province's water conservancy construction, work efficiency has been rapidly improved, so the progress of the project has been both fast and good. The same is true in agricultural production. Wherever the "Eight-Character Charter" is seriously grasped and cultivation techniques are continuously improved, the yield growth is fast. For example, the Pidong Brigade of the Pidong Commune in Lu'an County has improved a set of cultivation techniques for planting wheat, and the average yield of wheat in the whole team has reached 830 jin per mu.
    In order to ensure the continued Great Leap Forward in production and construction this year, we must, on the existing basis, launch a larger-scale and continuous technological innovation movement. In industry, it is required to do better what can already be done; to make what cannot be done but is possible to be made; to make large products with small equipment; to make new products with old equipment; and to make more and better products with the same working hours and raw materials as last year. In agriculture, it is required to turn low yields into high yields and high yields into even higher yields. In short, we must turn advanced production levels into the production level of the entire society; we must comprehensively improve labor productivity and truly realize the call of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee to have one person do the work of two people.
    To achieve the above requirements, we must fully launch the technological innovation movement. From cities to rural areas, from the production process to the circulation process, from production units to cultural, educational, and health departments, from factories to mines, from heavy industry to light industry, from agriculture to forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and from water conservancy to all aspects of the "Eight-Character Charter," we must vigorously carry out technological innovation. In the past, some people believed that technological innovation was a matter for industrial departments, and agricultural departments could not engage in it; or that production departments should engage in it, but cultural, educational, and health departments could not. This one-sided view must be broken. We must realize that any department, any production unit, and any production process has a place to use technological innovation, and we must actively strive for technological innovation. Therefore, all walks of life and units must carry out innovation based on their own characteristics, from production tools, production operations, the conservation and substitution of raw materials, the design of new products, as well as working methods, management methods, and teaching methods, so as to vigorously develop the technological innovation movement in all aspects. Only in this way can all aspects advance together.
    The technological innovation movement must not only bloom in all directions, but also grasp the key points. Generally speaking, the current focus is on tool reform and scientific research. The focus of tool reform should be placed on labor-intensive and weak departments and links, such as water conservancy, transportation, harvesting, processing, and manual industrial production, etc. These places have the greatest potential for technological innovation, the most urgent demand for improving technology, and the most labor that can be saved. For example, the water conservancy tool reform last winter saved as many as 2 million workers. In tool reform, we must implement the combination of native and foreign methods. In the combination of native and foreign methods, we must fully utilize wind power, water power, and animal power to replace human power, because this method can save materials, is simple and easy to implement, and can be done by everyone, which is conducive to universal promotion. Taking the reform of water management tools as an example, we did not mainly rely on electricity and machinery, but relied on semi-native and semi-foreign methods, using various existing power sources, and improved the tools for digging, loading, transporting, dumping, and compacting, so that it blossomed everywhere, so the average work efficiency of the province has been improved relatively quickly. Of course, we must also engage in the innovation of "foreign" methods, especially more regularized factories and mines. Even relatively backward units cannot ignore this. Because some "foreign" methods can be promoted now, and some can be promoted after a period of time. Some comrades, without proceeding from reality, only want to engage in large-scale things, not small-scale things, only want to engage in foreign things, not native things, and are not interested in the combination of native and foreign things. As a result, the things that are made are limited by conditions and cannot be promoted. Although individual examples have very high work efficiency, the social work efficiency is still very low, and this bias must be overcome. Tool reform must not only manufacture tools that can be widely promoted, but also refit "foreign" tools to improve their efficiency and increase their uses. For example, a multi-tool lathe is equivalent to several lathes; for example, a water pump can be converted into an engine for a motorized sailboat and various agricultural product processing tools, so that they can be comprehensively utilized, which also has a great impact on improving labor productivity. In conjunction with tool reform, we must improve labor proficiency. The higher the labor proficiency, the more the role of the tool can be发挥, and the higher the labor productivity can be. Many of our factories and mines are apprentices. If they can be quickly trained to become skilled workers in a quick way, the work efficiency can be quickly improved, which is also a problem that must be paid attention to. Another key point in technological innovation is to strengthen scientific research and better utilize science to serve production. At present, there is a bias that production departments do not pay attention to scientific research. They do not understand that to engage in more complex and advanced things, one must have some specialized scientific knowledge. Another bias is that scientific research workers do not pay attention to production. They do not understand that science itself serves production, and only by combining with production can the research speed be accelerated. Therefore, in order to strengthen scientific research, all levels from top to bottom must establish the scientific research institutions they need, and all production departments must conduct scientific research in conjunction with production; the staff of scientific research institutions must establish the view of serving production, on the one hand, study the problems that urgently need to be solved in the current production and construction, and on the other hand, think about the long-term and study more advanced things. Scientific research must be planned comprehensively, and research projects must be determined by industry, industry, and level, and a combination of widespread mobilization and grasping the key points must be adopted to promote the rapid development of scientific undertakings.
    In order to do a good job in technological innovation, we must further implement the method of combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and production personnel. The key to the combination of the three lies in the leading cadres, because only when the leading cadres seriously grasp it can everyone be mobilized and organized. According to our experience, there are three ways for leading cadres to grasp technological innovation: First, leading cadres personally take action, cultivate key points, and lead everyone; second, the masses make suggestions, technical personnel conduct reviews, leading cadres make choices, organize forces to conduct research, and then promote it after success; third, leaders come up with topics, everyone writes articles, and then summarizes and improves them. These are all effective methods. For example, the high-efficiency movement for water management in Anhui Province, the large-scale biogas movement, and the overcoming of technical barriers in ironmaking and steelmaking have all achieved results quickly in this way. This is actually the leadership method that Comrade Mao Zedong has always taught us, "combining the general and the individual, combining the leadership and the masses," which must be better used in the future.
    Leaders at all levels must not only take action personally, but also boldly mobilize the masses, guide the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses to technological innovation and scientific research, and create a mass movement in which everyone engages in science and technology. Some people only believe in the physical strength of the masses, not in the intelligence of the masses, and believe that the masses have low cultural levels and cannot engage in science and technology. This view is obviously wrong. Inventions and creations in technological innovation mostly come from ordinary production personnel, which is a powerful proof. We should trust the masses, rely on the masses; we should often encourage everyone to make suggestions, find tricks, and engage in innovation in light of the problems in production; we should run various spare-time schools, organize various research groups, and extensively carry out scientific and technological research activities, so that everyone can learn while doing, improve step by step, truly master science and technology in their own hands, and promote the high-speed progress of production and construction.
    IV. We Must Strengthen Political Work
    Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. Because production and construction are to be completed by people, and people's actions are governed by thoughts, and thoughts are the soul and commander of people, only by strengthening political and ideological education, so that everyone recognizes the goals of struggle and the road to advancement, can they strengthen their will and work together wholeheartedly to do a good job in socialist construction. If political and ideological work is neglected, capitalist ideology will take advantage of the opportunity, dissipate morale, confuse the direction, and lead economic work astray. Therefore, the party's political work is the fundamental guarantee for implementing the general line, and only by constantly strengthening political work can we achieve continuous leap forward.
    The basic task of current political work is to strengthen socialist education, improve the political awareness and ideological awareness of the broad cadres and the masses, so as to achieve the requirements of boosting morale, fighting against evil winds, and strengthening unity. These are the issues that must be constantly paid attention to in political work.
    Boosting morale is the determining factor for achieving the Great Leap Forward. Only with soaring morale can we not be afraid of difficulties, know the difficulties and move forward, and use poor methods to change nature; can we study hard and persistently, carry forward the spirit of originality, and make outstanding achievements. Without morale, we will lose our fighting spirit, surrender in the face of difficulties, and become lazy men and cowards. Of course, it is impossible to come up with any creations or inventions. Therefore, whether or not there is morale is a question of measuring whether a person has revolutionary will, and it is also the key issue in determining whether work can be done well. How can we truly boost morale? We know that morale is determined by enthusiasm, enthusiasm is determined by ideological awareness, and to improve ideological awareness, we must rely on political education. Only by constantly strengthening socialist and communist education, continuously improving everyone's enthusiasm and initiative, and thoroughly eliminating erroneous thoughts that affect morale can we boost morale. While strengthening political education, we must also pay attention to the practical demands of the masses and combine grasping thoughts with grasping life. In this way, the masses' morale will become greater and more lasting.
    Fighting against evil winds is an important guarantee for adhering to the implementation of the general line. On the road of socialist construction, it is impossible to have smooth sailing, and various evil winds will inevitably appear, which is a necessary reflection of class struggle. In the process of fighting against evil winds, we are required to do a good job of four words: Recognize, Resist, Prevent, and Eliminate. The so-called "Recognize" means to be good at identifying wind direction. When evil winds show their heads, they often wear various disguises in an attempt to deceive others. It is not easy to recognize them clearly. Only by continuously improving political level, mastering the methods of class analysis, distinguishing between nine fingers and one finger in case of trouble, and seeing clearly which class it benefits, can we maintain a clear head in the face of major issues of right and wrong. The so-called "Resist" means to bite the bullet and resist the evil winds. Although evil winds cannot become a climate, they are very fierce in the early stages, and it is necessary to have a firm class stand to resist them. And only by resisting them first can we further expose them, so that everyone can see their essence and rise up to launch a struggle; and in some disputes, when reason cannot be clarified, we can only resist on the one hand and continue to work according to the correct policies and policies on the other hand, using facts to refute erroneous arguments. For example, the truth that "production can be increased even in the face of disaster" cannot break skepticism until a large number of facts prove it. The so-called "Prevent" means to prevent evil winds from growing and making trouble. Some evil winds appear in the form of a hard attack, while other evil winds are sugar-coated bullets, which specialize in corrupting the thoughts of cadres and the masses in an attempt to disarm us. This kind of thing is particularly dangerous, and we must be more vigilant. The so-called "Eliminate" means to eliminate the bad influence of evil winds. Whenever evil winds come, they enter every pore to expand their positions, and some people who lack immunity will be infected. Therefore, it is necessary to organize mass criticisms of evil winds in a timely manner, combined with positive education, and completely eliminate the remaining poison, so as to protect the socialist cause from harm.
    Strengthening unity is the source of strength for our invincible power. Everyone knows: "Unity is strength." Lenin once said: "The reason why the proletariat can become and must become an invincible force lies in the fact that the ideological unity formed according to the principles of Marxism is consolidated by organizational material unity, and this organization unites millions of workers into an army of the working class." Facts have also proven that the great victories we have achieved in all our work rely on the unity of the whole party and the unity of the whole people. To constantly consolidate and strengthen these two unities, we must strengthen party spirit education within the party and strengthen socialist and collectivist education among the masses, so that everyone can correctly understand the relationship between current interests and long-term interests, the relationship between the local and the whole, greatly improve the communist style, and greatly carry forward the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. At the same time, we must, according to the formula of "unity-criticism-unity," adopt the attitude of treating illnesses and saving people, learning from past mistakes, and correctly handle the contradictions arising from different ideological understandings. Under the premise of socialism, we must unite all those who can be united, fully mobilize all positive factors, and accelerate socialist construction.
    Political work is the commander and soul of all work. We must earnestly strengthen political work, effectively do a good job in political work, and carry forward the excellent tradition of our party's consistent emphasis on political work on all fronts. For those who see things but not people, and for those who only manage business and do not grasp politics, we must criticize and overcome these biases. No matter what we do, we must combine the virtual with the real, and use the virtual to drive the real. When deploying work, we must explain its political significance to everyone. When checking and summarizing work, we must affirm the achievements politically, point out the shortcomings, and put forward the direction of efforts. And we must always grasp the ideological trends of cadres and the masses, conduct education in a targeted manner, and improve everyone's ideological and theoretical level. In this way, we will surely make our team healthier and stronger, and advance like a broken bamboo on all fronts.
    Seriously Study and Master the Invincible Weapon - Mao Zedong Thought
    The key to guaranteeing the complete realization of the above requirements lies in strengthening the leadership of the Party. With good leadership, things can be done well; with bad leadership, things that could have been done well may also be in danger of not being done well. In order to make our leadership work better and more correct, every leading comrade must seriously study Mao Zedong Thought. Learn from his example of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, his ability to use Marxism-Leninism to analyze and solve problems in the Chinese revolution and construction

    认清大好形势，千方百计地为实现今年的更大跃进而奋斗
    中共安徽省委第一书记　曾希圣
    1959年是继续大跃进的第二年。这一年，安徽省各个生产战线都已完成和超额完成了国家计划，取得了更为巨大的胜利。在工业生产方面：“洋钢”产量比特大跃进的1958年增长五倍多，“洋铁”产量增长三倍多，煤炭产量增长85％；工业总产值增长54％，又一次实现了特大跃进。在农业生产方面，虽然遭受百年未有的特大干旱，但仍然获得比特大跃进的1958年更高的产量，农业总产值增长16．5％，实现了大跃进；在这种特大干旱情况下的大跃进，它实际上也是历史上的一个特大奇迹。
    现在，1959年已经过去，1960年已经到来，展望新的一年，究竟是什么样的一年，跃进，大跃进，还是特大跃进？怎样才能实现更大更好的跃进？这是当前大家最关心的问题，也是迫切需要作出回答的问题。
    今年能够实现更大跃进的有利条件
    根据跃进、大跃进、特大跃进的标准，权衡当前的有利形势，肯定1960年仍然是继续大跃进的一年，而且可能是全面大跃进以至特大跃进的一年。这是因为：我们有一条经过实践证明完全正确的社会主义建设总路线，有一支政治思想觉悟和技术水平大大提高了的劳动大军，有日益巩固和健康发展的人民公社，有连续两年大跃进的丰富经验，有比之以往更加雄厚的物质基础，等等。这些都是实现今年继续大跃进的有利条件和有力保证。
    但是，有右倾思想的人，却有着另外一种看法。他们认为：“连续两年大跃进，基数大了，潜力不足了，办法不多了，劳动力已经够紧张的了”，他们的结论是：“今年不能继续大跃进，甚至连跃进也不可能。”这种看法显然是错误的。
    基数大了能不能大跃进，这是一个值得研究的问题。基数增大以后，对增产幅度的继续提高，固然有一定的限制作用，然而在目前情况下，这种限制作用是微不足道的。我们认为基数虽然大了，但仍然能够继续大跃进。
    这是因为，潜力不是不足，而是越来越大。所谓潜力，就是发展生产的潜在力量。潜力大致可分两种：一种是暂时还不能挖掘出来的，一种是现时可以挖掘出来的。前一种潜力，是取之不尽，用之不竭的，后一种潜力也是随着生产的发展而不断增加的。基数的增大，正是表明了潜力的增大，因为基数大了，物质力量就更加雄厚，生产技术会更加提高，这就使我们挖掘潜力的范围和能力也就随之扩大和增强。潜力大了，增产的能力也必然提高。至于是否能够大跃进，就要看从挖掘出来的潜力使生产增长幅度的大小而定。比如，在工业方面，被挖掘出来的潜力，能够使工业生产增长25％以上，就算大跃进；在农业方面，能够使农业生产增长15％以上，也就算大跃进。从安徽省现有的潜力来看，是完全具备以上条件的。拿钢的生产来说，1958年8月以前，三吨的炼钢转炉一个也没有，现在已经建立了五十一座；过去一天只炼七炉钢，现在一天能炼三十五炉钢，而且合格率也大大提高。有了这个基础，就能使今年的钢产量比1959年又有巨大的增长。再拿粮食生产来说，今年粮食的播种面积良种推广的面积都要扩大，今年的蓄水量、肥料也都要增加，加上其他有利条件，就能使今年的粮食产量继续大跃进。当然，现有的生产潜力还不止这些，这里指的是看得到的，有一些还是看不到的，这些看不到的潜力，非用心想一想，算一算，千方百计地挖掘不可。否则，潜力再大，也不能发挥它的作用。群众对于潜力越挖越大的比喻说得好，他们说：“潜力好比地下水，井越挖越深，水就越来越大，不怕井底深，就怕人不挖”。因此，只要我们开动脑筋，多找窍门，提高科学技术水平，不但现有的生产潜力能被充分使用出来，而且蕴藏在自然界的无限潜力，也会不断被挖掘出来。
    这是因为，办法不是少了，而是越来越多。所谓办法，就是生产措施，它是从实践中创造出来的。人们的实践越丰富，对客观规律的认识越深刻，办法就越多。恩格斯在“自然辩证法”一书中曾经说过：“随着对自然规律知识之迅速增加，人对自然界的反作用之手段也增加了。”我国古话所说的“经一事，长一智”，也正是这个道理。经过两年大跃进的伟大实践，随着生产的突飞猛进和技术的迅速提高，我们的经验比过去更加丰富了，办法比过去更加充实了。这从安徽省一年来技术革新事迹的层出不穷，高额丰产典型的大量涌现等方面，看得最为明显。据1959年不完全的统计，在工业方面已经实现的革新项目有十六万七千四百多种；在农村中创制和改制的先进工具有一万八千多种；而且还创造了许多很有价值的东西，如不用木材钢材的房子，不用电炉炼出安徽省从来没有生产过的矽钢，冬天也能正常产生沼气的保温沼气池，只用二级半风可以带动钢磨的风车等等。在耕作上，创造了一套水稻、小麦、棉花的高产办法，做到了早稻超中稻，晚稻超早稻，小麦、棉花大面积高产；对于八字宪法的运用，也创造了许多新的办法，就拿积肥来说，已由原来的积肥十字诀（烧、熏、挖、换、扫、沤、铲、堆、拾、捞），进一步发展成为：以养为主、养种积制并举的更加有效更加完整的办法。这些事实进一步说明，群众的智慧是无穷的。只要深入群众，向群众学习，就可以总结出经验，找到更多更好的办法。叫喊“办法不多了”的人，只不过说明他们不肯深入实际，思想僵化罢了！
    这是因为，群众的劳动热情和技术革新结合得更好了，劳动力不是越来越紧张，而是逐步趋向缓和。搞大跃进不能单纯靠体力，更重要的是靠智力。体力是有限的，智慧是无穷的。只要把群众的冲天干劲和顽强钻劲结合起来，把劳动热情和技术革新结合起来，就能更大地发挥劳动力的作用。许多地方由于大搞技术革新，大搞工具改革，大搞高工效的群众运动，已经做到增产不增人，甚至增产减人。从目前全省情况来看，劳动的紧张状况，还会继续缓和下来。在工业战线上，1958年投入生产的劳动力，共有一百一十三万人，1959年减少了三十六万人，生产不但没有降低，反而直线上升。有了去年的基础，今年的情况还会更好一些。去冬以来的水利建设，同样足以说明这种趋势。据去年12月下旬统计，平均工效十方以上，比大搞水利建设的1957年增加了三倍多。累计工程进度十七亿二千五百万方，比1957年的同期增长72％。而所用的劳动力，则比1957年的同期减少53％。目前，一个大搞技术革新，节省劳动力，提高工效的群众运动，正在全省范围内轰轰烈烈地展开，只要把这一运动继续坚持下去，把先进经验普遍推广，生产效率将会进一步提高，劳动力的紧张状况定然会大大好转。
    从上述分析中，可以清楚的看出，能不能继续大跃进，不取决于基数的大小，而取决于主客观两方面的条件。当客观条件已经具备之后，关键就在于主观努力。如果抱着懒汉和懦夫的态度，不去鼓足干劲，力争上游，那么，即使基数再小，条件再好，也不能大跃进。如果干劲冲天，不断钻研，即使基数增大，也能够继续大跃进。那些认为基数大了，不能大跃进的人，实际上是自己缺乏干劲和钻劲，因此既看不到客观有利条件，也看不到主观的能动作用，显然，这种看法是不合事实的。我们应当认清当前的大好形势，加强主观努力，充分运用和发挥一切有利条件，满怀信心地为实现今年的更大跃进而奋斗。
    千方百计地提高劳动生产率
    现在的问题是，安徽省的劳动生产率还是不高的，比先进地区还差得很远，就机械制造业来说，由于学徒多，熟练程度低，劳动生产率比上海几乎要差一半。因此我们的努力方向，就是要提高劳动生产率。只有这样，才能充分减少劳动力的支付，减少原材料的消耗，降低成本，提高质量，发挥人力、物力、财力的作用；才能在各行各业各生产单位腾出更多的人力、物力、财力，用以增加新的企业，扩大基本建设，实现农业、轻工业、重工业的全面跃进。相反，如果单靠增加劳动力的数量，提高劳动强度来增加生产，就会影响生产持续和全面的跃进。因此，在一切工作中，都必须千方百计地提高劳动生产率。根据以往的经验，特别是大跃进以来的经验，要达到这个要求，必须从以下各方面努力。
     一、必须找出费力小、增产大的措施
    在生产建设中，所有战略和战术措施，都要符合“费力小，增产大”的要求。只有这样，才能就现有的人力、物力，做出更大更好的成绩，才能赢得高速度的发展。这是我们在和自然界作斗争中得出的一条经验，也是多快好省地建设社会主义的一条捷径。几年来的事实充分证明，按照这个要求办事，效果十分显著。1958年春，安徽省在治水改种方面，提出了“相信群众，依靠群众，小型为主，大中支持，以蓄为主，尽量少排，河网化，水稻化”的方针。这样做的结果，钱花得少，工程办得多，因而大大加速了水利建设的进度，保证了农业生产的高速度发展。1958年冬大办钢铁时，我们在土洋结合的基础上，提出了以小洋群为主的方针。这不但省劳力，省原料，而且质量好，效率高，结果超额完成了钢铁生产任务，并为钢铁生产的继续大发展奠定了牢固的基础。
    “费力小，增产大”这一基本要求是始终不变的，但是，实现这一要求的具体措施是随着客观条件的改变和主观认识的提高，而不断丰富和发展起来。去年9月我们根据这一精神，总结了两年来大跃进的经验，对1960年的工农业生产，初步地提出了一系列带有关键性的增产措施。农业方面：在原有基础上，提出了扩大春播面积，加快扩大改种水稻的面积，全部改用良种和开荒七百五十万亩等措施。这比之以往单纯提出提高夏收比重，扩大复种面积，一般地提出稻改和采用良种，有了进一步的发展。经验证明，春播作物的产量要比麦茬作物高30％到50％；开荒好像费些劳动力，但因去年冬天开的荒地，今年春播可以不要肥料，所以实际上还是节省劳动力；旱地改种水稻，每亩增产一二百斤是完全有把握的；改用良种更是简便易行而效果很大的增产措施，就拿水稻来说，良种比一般品种能增产20％到80％。只要把这些措施抓好，今年农业生产就可能有一个更大的跃进。工业方面：根据当前的条件，对支援农村方面提出了大搞化肥小洋群和大量生产简易机械；在冶金工业方面，提出了由“小洋群”向“中洋群”发展和大搞烧结矿；在交通运输方面，提出了大搞土铁路和结合水利建设大力发展水上运输；在采煤方面，提出了多种节约坑木的办法。这些都比去年进了一步。譬如大搞烧结矿，由于粉矿多，开采容易，能够节省大量的劳动力，而且出铁量大，焦比低，又可提高质量，降低成本，是一举数得的办法。大搞土铁路，能就地取材，而且简便易行，见效快，运量大；水利建设和发展水运相结合，一举两得，就能收到事半功倍的效果。
    这种战略性、战术性的措施，不仅在省的范围内存在着，而且每个厂矿、车间、工地、公社、生产队都是存在的。问题在于我们如何把它找出来。因此各个地区、各个部门、各个生产单位，都要根据这一精神，按照自己的情况、自己的特点和经验，实事求是地找出一套切实可行的增产措施。这样就能大大节省劳动用量，普遍提高劳动生产率，从而保证全省任务的完成。
    二、必须作出大大节省劳动力的布局
    在生产建设中，注意合理布局，对提高劳动生产率，具有十分重大的意义。布局搞得好，就能便利原料和产品的调运，大大节省不必要的劳动支付；就能加快建设的速度，减少基建的投资；就能充分利用自然资源，保证生产正常发展。1959年比1958年，我们以较少的劳力取得更大的工业产值的重要原因，就是由于进行了工业的合理布局。但是，还有些地方做得不够。而且还有人认为工业需要讲究布局，农业不需要讲究布局，这种想法是必须纠正的。我们要把这个精神切实贯彻到各个方面，贯彻到每个生产单位中去，使所有生产单位，都能根据这个要求，对基地的建立、劳动力的安排、各个环节之间的衔接，作出合理布局。
    在布局中，必须按照就原料、就需要的原则，确定基地的建立。在工业上，要使生产单位尽可能地接近原料产地和消费地区，缩短运输里程。在企业内部，各个部分、各个车间之间，也都必须适当安排，使各个工序密切配合，使生产正常运转。在农业上，同样要讲究基本建设的布局。如搞田头窖，就地积肥，就地施肥，把积肥和施肥统一起来，这就能减少往返运输。再如田头建猪圈，便于把猪粪送到田里，也是一个节省劳力的办法。最好把养猪场和沼气站以及农副产品加工厂结合起来。用猪的粪便和杂草制造沼气作燃料，既可利用沼气加工农副产品，加工饲料，又可提高肥效，同时农副产品的下脚则可用作猪的精饲料，这是最合算的办法。这些窍门在每个生产环节都是很多的，要分别不同情况，具体研究，作出最节省劳动力的布局。
    在布局中，必须合理安排劳动力。这里需要注意以下几个问题：一是每个经常性的生产行业和单位，都要建立专业队，全面推行定产、定质、定员制度。二是各个专业队伍、各个工序之间，在不影响正常生产的情况下，要大力组织协作，以闲济忙，以多济少，以强济弱。三是组织城市劳力支援农村。去年夏秋之间，安徽省曾动员机关干部、部队官兵、厂矿商店职工和城镇居民一百一十多万人，下乡支援农业生产，共做了九千二百六十多万个工作日，对抗灾增产、加强基层工作、支援穷队、密切干群关系和城乡关系都起了重要作用。这个办法，在可能条件下是应当继续采取的。
    在布局中，必须注意加强薄弱环节。国民经济是一个有机整体，各部门互相制约、互相推动。如果有某些环节跟不上，就会影响全局，妨碍生产的提高。所以必须抓紧薄弱环节，使它迅速赶上。就当前全省情况来说，在工业上，主要是电力不足，材料品种不全，交通运输紧张。必须采取自力更生为主、中小为主、土洋结合的办法，迅速改变这种情况。就各个工业系统来说，也有个别落后部门，产量低，质量差，必须针对这些部门的具体情况，放手发动群众，改变落后面貌。在农村中，有个别县和少数社、队，工作比较落后，生产发展较慢，必须大力加强对这些地区的领导，充分发掘这些地方的雄厚潜力，使它们迅速赶上高产地区，不再发生拖腿现象。总而言之，领导的责任，就在于一手抓先进，一手抓落后，使落后赶上先进，这样循环往复，整个地区、整个行业、整个企业的劳动生产率就会不断上升。
    三、必须大搞技术革新
    技术不断革新，是全面保证提高劳动生产率的中心环节。因为只有如此，才能节省劳动力，减轻劳动强度，节约原材料，增强挖掘自然潜力的能力，做到高产优质和保证生产安全。所以，技术革新是保证大跃进正常发展的根本办法。
    这两年来，安徽省群众性的技术革新运动，取得了很大成就。事实证明，凡是技术革新搞得好的地区、行业和单位，生产成绩就大，建设发展就快。如安徽省的钢铁工业，由于对技术革新一直抓得较紧，所以产量和质量的提高都比较快，特种钢材的生产也已初步解决。安徽省水利建设，由于普遍大搞工具改革，工效迅速提高，因此工程的进展既快又好。在农业生产上也是这样，凡是认真地抓“八字宪法”，不断改进耕作技术的，产量增长就快，像六安县淠东公社淠东大队，由于改进了种植小麦的一套耕作技术，全队小麦平均亩产已达八百三十斤。
    为了保证今年生产建设的继续大跃进，我们必须在现有基础上，开展一个规模更大的、持久不息的技术革新运动。在工业上要求做到：已经能做的东西，要求做得更好；还不能做而又可能做的东西，要求把它做成；小的设备要能做出大的产品，旧的设备要能做出新的产品；用和去年同样的工时和原料，要能做出更多更好的产品。在农业上要求做到：低产变高产，高产更高产。总之要把先进生产水平，变成全社会的生产水平；要把劳动生产率全面提高，确实实现安徽省委提出的一个人顶两个人的号召。
    要达到上述要求，必须把技术革新运动全面展开。从城市到农村，从生产过程到流通过程，从生产单位到文教卫生部门，从工厂到矿山，从重工业到轻工业，从农业到林牧副渔，从水利到“八字宪法”的各个环节，都要大搞技术革新。过去有人认为：技术革新是工业部门的事，农业部门可以不搞；或者认为：生产部门要搞，文教卫生部门可以不搞，这种片面观点必须打破。要认识到：任何一个部门、任何一个生产单位、任何一个生产工序，都有技术革新的用武之地，都要积极为技术革新努力。所以，各行各业各个单位都要根据本身的特点，从生产工具，生产操作，原材料的节约和代用，新产品的设计以及工作方法、管理方法、教学方法进行革新，把技术革新运动，从各个方面蓬蓬勃勃的开展起来。只有这样，才能使各个方面齐头并进。
    技术革新运动既要全面开花，又要抓住重点。总的来说，当前的重点是工具改革和科学研究。工具改革的重点应当放在劳力花得多的以及薄弱的部门和环节，如水利、运输、收割、加工、手工操作的工业生产等等。这些地方技术革新的潜力最大，对提高技术的要求最迫切，能节省出来的劳力也最多，如去冬的水利工具改革，就节省了上工人数二百万之多。在工具改革中，必须实行土洋结合。在土洋结合中，必须充分运用风力、水力、畜力，使之代替人力，因为这种办法能节省材料，简便易行，人人能办，有利于普遍推广。就以改革治水工具为例，我们不是主要地依靠电力、机械，而是依靠半土半洋的办法，利用了各种现有的动力，改进了挖、装、运、倒、压各个工序的工具，使它遍地开花，所以全省的平均工效提高得比较快。当然，也要搞“洋”办法的革新，特别是比较正规化的厂、矿要如此。就是比较后进的单位，也不能忽视。因为有些“洋”办法现在就能推广，有些可以过一时期推广。有些同志，不从实际出发，只想搞大的，不想搞小的，只愿搞洋的，不愿搞土的，对土洋结合的也不感兴趣，结果搞出来的东西为条件所限，不能推广。虽然个别典型，工效很高，但社会工效仍然很低，这种偏向必须克服。工具改革，不仅要制造能够普遍推广的工具，同时也要改装“洋”的工具，使之效率提高和用途增大。如多刀车床，一部就等于几部；如抽水机改成机帆船的发动机和各种农产品的加工工具，就能使之起综合利用的效果，这对提高劳动生产率的作用也是不小的。结合工具改革，必须提高劳动熟练程度。劳动熟练程度越高，工具的作用就越能发挥，劳动生产率也就越能提高。我们许多厂矿，都是学徒工，如果能够以速成的办法，使之迅速成为熟练工人，则工效可以迅速提高，这也是一个必须注意的问题。在技术革新中的另一个重点，是加强科学研究，更好地利用科学为生产服务。目前，有一种偏向是生产部门不重视科学研究，他们不了解要搞比较复杂和高级的东西，非得有一些专门的科学知识不可。另一种偏向是科学研究工作者不重视生产，他们不了解科学本身就是为生产服务，也只有结合生产，才能加快研究速度。所以，为了加强科学研究，从上到下各级都要建立自己所需要的科学研究机构，所有生产部门都要结合生产进行科学研究；科学研究机构的工作人员，必须树立为生产服务的观点，一方面研究当前生产建设中亟须解决的问题，一方面从长远着想，研究比较高级的东西。科学研究工作必须订出全面规划，分行分业分级定出研究项目，采取广泛动员和抓住重点相结合的办法，促使科学事业的飞速发展。
    为了把技术革新搞好，必须进一步贯彻领导干部、技术人员和生产人员三结合的办法。三结合的关键在于领导干部，因为只有领导干部认真地抓，才能把大家发动和组织起来。根据我们的经验，领导干部抓技术革新的办法有三：一是领导干部亲自动手，培养重点，带动大家；二是群众提建议，技术人员作审查，领导干部作选择，组织力量进行研究，成功之后，再行推广；三是领导出题目，大家做文章，然后加以总结提高。这些都是行之有效的办法。像安徽省治水的高工效运动，大搞沼气运动，以及攻破炼铁、炼钢的技术关，都是这样迅速取得效果的。这实际上就是毛泽东同志一向教导我们的“一般和个别相结合，领导和群众相结合”的领导方法，今后必须更好地加以运用。
    各级领导不但要亲自动手，还要放手发动群众，把广大群众的冲天干劲引导到技术革新和科学研究上来，造成一个人人搞科学技术的群众运动。有些人只相信群众的体力，不相信群众的智力，认为群众文化低，不能搞科学技术，这种看法显然是错误的。技术革新中的发明、创造，大都出于普通生产人员之手，就是一个有力的证明。我们应当相信群众，依靠群众；应当经常鼓励大家针对生产中的问题，提建议，找窍门，搞革新；应当开办各种业余学校，组织各种研究小组，广泛开展科学技术的研究活动，使大家边干边学，步步提高，把科学技术真正掌握在自己手里，来推动生产建设的高速度前进。
    四、必须加强政治工作
    政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。因为生产建设是要靠人来完成的，而人的行动是受思想支配的，思想是人的灵魂和统帅，只有加强政治思想教育，使大家认清奋斗的目标和前进的道路，才能坚定意志，一心一德的为搞好社会主义建设而共同奋斗。如果忽视了政治思想工作，资本主义思想就会乘虚而入，就会涣散斗志，迷惑方向，使经济工作走到邪路上去。所以说，党的政治工作是贯彻执行总路线的根本保证，只有经常加强政治工作，才能做到持续跃进。
    当前政治工作的基本任务，就是要加强社会主义教育，提高广大干部和群众的政治觉悟和思想觉悟，从而达到鼓足干劲、斗倒歪风、加强团结的要求。这些，也就是在政治工作中必须经常注意的问题。
    鼓足干劲，是实现大跃进的决定因素。只有干劲冲天，才能不怕困难，知难而进，用穷办法革自然的命；才能苦学苦钻，发扬独创精神，做出优异的成绩。如果没有干劲，就会失去斗志，就会在困难面前投降，成为懒汉和懦夫，当然更不可能搞出什么创造发明。所以，有没有干劲，是衡量一个人有没有革命意志的问题，也是决定工作能不能搞好的关键问题。怎样才能真正鼓足干劲呢？我们知道，干劲决定于积极性，积极性又决定于思想觉悟，而要提高思想觉悟，则必须依靠政治教育。只有经常加强社会主义和共产主义教育，不断提高大家的积极性和自觉性，彻底清除影响干劲的错误思想，才能把干劲鼓足。在加强政治教育的同时，还要注意关心群众的切身要求，把抓思想和抓生活结合起来，这样，群众的干劲就会越来越大，持久不息。
    斗倒歪风，是坚持贯彻总路线的重要保证。在社会主义建设的道路上，不可能是一帆风顺的，一定会出现各种歪风，这是阶级斗争的必然反映。在斗倒歪风的过程中，要求我们做好：识、顶、防、消四个字。所谓“识”，就是要善于识别风向。歪风露头的时候，往往披着各色伪装，企图蒙蔽别人。要识别得一清二楚，是不容易的。只有不断提高政治水平，掌握阶级分析的方法，遇事分清九个指头和一个指头，看清它对哪个阶级有利，这才能在大是大非面前保持清醒的头脑。所谓“顶”，就是要硬着头皮顶住歪风。歪风虽然成不了气候，但在初起之时，来势十分凶猛，一定要有坚定的阶级立场，才能顶得住它。而且也只有先把它顶住，才能进一步暴露它，使大家看清它的本质，起来展开斗争；还有些争论，在有理说不清的时候，也只有一面顶住，一面继续按照正确的方针、政策去干，用事实批驳错误的论调。如“有灾也能增产”的真理，在没有大量事实证明以前，是不可能打破怀疑论的。所谓“防”，就是要防止歪风滋长作怪。有一种歪风是用硬攻的形式出现的，另一种歪风是糖衣炮弹，它专门腐蚀干部和群众的思想，企图解除我们的武装。这种东西特别危险，更要提高警惕。所谓“消”，就是要消除歪风邪气的不良影响。每当歪风袭来，它就无孔不入地扩大自己的阵地，有些缺乏免疫力的人就会受到感染。所以对歪风必须适时地组织群众性的批判，结合进行正面教育，彻底消除遗毒，才能保卫社会主义事业不受损害。
    加强团结，是我们无往而不胜的力量的源泉。大家都知道：“团结就是力量”，列宁曾说过：“无产阶级所以能够成为而且必然成为不可战胜的力量，就是因为它根据马克思主义原则形成的思想统一是用组织的物质统一来巩固的，这个组织把千百万劳动者团结成工人阶级的大军。”事实也证明，我们在一切工作中所取得的伟大胜利，都是依靠全党的团结和全民的团结。我们要不断巩固和加强这两个团结，就必须在党内加强党性教育，在群众中加强社会主义和集体主义教育，使大家正确认识目前利益和长远利益的关系，局部和整体的关系，大大提高共产主义的风格，大大发扬互助协作的精神。同时，必须根据“团结—批评—团结”的公式，抱着治病救人、惩前毖后的态度，正确处理由于思想认识不同而产生的矛盾，在社会主义的前提下，把一切可能团结的人都团结起来，充分调动一切积极因素，才能加速社会主义建设。
    政治工作是一切工作的统帅和灵魂，我们一定要认真加强政治工作，切实做好政治工作，把我们党一贯重视政治工作的优良传统在各条战线上发扬光大起来。对于那些见物不见人的思想，对于那些只管业务、不抓政治的偏向，必须批判克服。不论做什么事，都要虚实并举，以虚带实，在布置工作的时候，要向大家说明它的政治意义，在检查总结工作的时候，要从政治上肯定成绩，指出缺点，提出努力方向。而且要经常掌握干部和群众的思想动向，有的放矢地进行教育，提高大家的思想、理论水平。这样，就一定能使我们的队伍更加健全，更加强大，在各条战线上势如破竹地迈步前进。

    保证上述各项要求完满实现的关键，在于加强党的领导。领导得好，就能把事情做好；领导得不好，本来能够做好的事情，也会有做不好的危险。为了使我们的领导工作做得更好，更正确，每个领导同志都要认真学习毛泽东的思想。学习他把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合的榜样，他善于运用马克思列宁主义来分析和解决中国革命和建设中的问题，不论问题怎样复杂，在他手里总是分析得那样深刻，解决得那样透彻。学习他把严肃的原则精神和生动的独创精神相结合的榜样，不论是在对敌斗争中，或者是在党的原则斗争中，他总是坚决地捍卫马克思列宁主义又从而发展了马克思列宁主义。学习他把革命发展阶段论和不断革命论相结合的榜样，不论在革命和建设中，他都善于及时提出新的革命任务，使干部和群众经常保持饱满的热情，从胜利走向更大的胜利，学习他坚持群众路线，从群众中来到群众中去，重视调查研究，多谋善断的榜样，他时时刻刻虚心向群众学习，先当群众的学生，再当群众的先生，处处从群众的利益出发，做出党的各种决定。学习他以大无畏的精神，披荆斩棘，排除万难，为真理而奋斗的榜样，他在复杂尖锐的斗争中，总是和群众一起，抓住了真理，坚定不移地奋勇前进。学习他团结全党，团结全民，谆谆善诱，诲人不倦的榜样，他具有高度的政治修养，善于团结群众，教育干部，爱护干部，帮助犯有错误的干部改正错误，使全党的团结坚如磐石，使全国人民亲如一家，从而保证了革命事业的胜利前进。总之，我们要学习他的理论著作、思想方法以及作风、态度和精神，把它运用到我们的具体工作中去，运用到我们的领导方法中去。虽然毛泽东同志的天才，我们是学不到的，但对于他的思想方法来说，只要我们努力学习，是可以学到的。解放以来，我们在和自然作斗争中，就是抱着学习运用毛泽东思想的态度和勇气，不断摸索客观规律的。虽然还做得不够，但也取得了一定的成绩，如在农业生产上提出的三项改革办法，在治水工作中提出的治水方针，都是行之有效的。当然还应当指出，我们对于毛泽东思想的学习还需要大大加强，有些人在学习中，对毛泽东著作的精神实质，领会不深不全，有的虽然从书本上学了一些东西，但是不能把它运用到实际工作中去；还有一种人则连书本也没有很好学习。这种情况必须加以改变。现在，我们正处在社会主义革命更加深入、社会主义建设飞跃发展的时期，两条道路、两条路线的斗争还很复杂，有时还很尖锐；对于繁重的建设任务，虽然已有一些经验，但还只是刚刚入门，需要继续钻研和提高。在这样的情况下，就更加要求我们认真学习毛泽东思想，牢牢地掌握住这个武器。只有这样，才能大大提高我们的思想水平和理论水平，才能在两条道路、两条路线的斗争中赢得全胜，才能更快地学会领导经济建设的本领，保证大跃进的胜利！
    今年是第二个五年计划的第三年。虽然我们已提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标，但决不能因此而松懈自满，必须再接再厉，使工农业生产获得更大的发展，为第三个五年计划做好更多的准备。今年是苦战的第三年，经过两年的苦战，我省面貌得到了很大的改变，但是还很不够，必须继续发扬苦战精神，争取在最短的时间内，根本改变安徽的面貌。今年是我国建国以来第二个十年的第一年。为了尽早把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家，我们应当加倍努力，让今年成为第二个十年的光辉灿烂的开端。现在，形势很好，有利条件很多，前途一片光明。只要我们高举毛泽东的旗帜，高举总路线的旗帜，按照党的八届八中全会的精神努力工作，我们就一定能够赢得更大更好更全面的跃进。
