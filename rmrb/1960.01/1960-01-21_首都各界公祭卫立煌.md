Xinhua News Agency, January 20th. People from all walks of life in the capital held a public memorial ceremony for Mr. Wei Lihuang, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, Representative of the National People's Congress, Standing Committee Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), at the Zhongshan Hall in Zhongshan Park on the morning of the 20th.

The public memorial ceremony was presided over by Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. Those accompanying the offering included: Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Li Weihan, and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Chen Yi and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Premiers of the State Council; Zhang Zhizhong and Fu Zuoyi, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council; Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee; Liu Wenhui and Jiang Guangnai, Standing Committee Members of the RCCK Central Committee.

In front of Mr. Wei Lihuang's mourning hall, there were wreaths sent by Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and other Party and state leaders such as Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Soong Ching Ling, Dong Biwu, Chen Yun, Lin Biao, and Deng Xiaoping.

Attending the public memorial ceremony were some members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and some People's Representatives in Beijing, some Standing Committee members of the CPPCC National Committee and some members in Beijing, some heads of government departments, some members of the National Defense Council, Standing Committee members and members of the RCCK Central Committee, as well as Mr. Wei Lihuang's relatives and friends.

As the public memorial ceremony began, the band played funeral music. The presiding officer, Zhou Enlai, presented a wreath to Mr. Wei Lihuang's spirit tablet. Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council and Vice Chairman of the RCCK Central Committee, delivered a eulogy.

In his eulogy, Zhang Zhizhong said that Comrade Wei Lihuang joined the army in his youth, served as a guard in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Guangzhou headquarters, and was gradually promoted from an ordinary soldier to a middle-level officer. During his participation in the Northern Expedition, he served as commander, brigade commander, and deputy division commander in the National Revolutionary Army. After Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, he followed him on a path that was seriously hostile to the people, especially in the Jinjiazhai campaign to attack the Dabie Mountains base area of the Red Army, which caused extremely heavy disasters to the people of northern Anhui. This is something that Comrade Wei Lihuang could not help but feel guilty about and regret.

Zhang Zhizhong said that in the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Wei Lihuang served successively as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Second War Area and the Commander-in-Chief of the First War Area and concurrently as the Commander-in-Chief of the Hebei-Chahar War Zone. He personally witnessed the brilliance and greatness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's policy of uniting to resist Japan, and personally witnessed the heroic struggle of the Eighth Route Army against the enemy. He gained much enlightenment and education, and established a good cooperative relationship with the Eighth Route Army, which was beneficial to the Eighth Route Army's struggle against Japan. Comrade Wei Lihuang contributed to the Anti-Japanese War, and his patriotic actions at that time were commendable.

Zhang Zhizhong said that after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of US imperialism, launched a full-scale civil war against the Communist Party and the people. The People's Liberation Army promptly launched a strong counterattack. In order to save the situation of the defeat in Northeast China, Chiang Kai-shek sent Comrade Wei Lihuang to serve as the "Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression" in Northeast China. At that time, Comrade Wei Lihuang, in view of the fact that the general situation was over, did not actively implement Chiang Kai-shek's "counter-offensive" order to struggle to the death. Chiang Kai-shek blamed the failure in Northeast China on Comrade Wei Lihuang and placed him under house arrest in Nanjing; he was not released and left for Hong Kong until Chiang Kai-shek stepped down. Since then, Comrade Wei Lihuang broke off contact with the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group.

Zhang Zhizhong said that in 1949, the People's Republic of China was founded, and Comrade Wei Lihuang sent a telegram from Hong Kong to Chairman Mao to express his congratulations. In 1954, on the basis of the completion of the three major movements and the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements by the Chinese people, all aspects of the cause progressed by leaps and bounds, the people's power was increasingly consolidated, and the international status was unprecedentedly improved. The Party and the government issued a call for the liberation of Taiwan and the unity of patriotism. In March 1955, Comrade Wei Lihuang returned to the embrace of the motherland and published "A Letter to Compatriots and Friends in Taiwan," praising the motherland's rapid progress under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, which was unprecedented in history, pointing out that the uprising generals of the Kuomintang were treated equally, and hoping that friends in Taiwan would wake up as soon as possible and not sink into destruction. The Party and the people welcomed this patriotic and just action of Comrade Wei Lihuang. Zhang Zhizhong said that after returning to the embrace of the motherland, Comrade Wei Lihuang was elected as a Standing Committee member of the CPPCC National Committee, a member of the National Defense Council, and in 1959, he was elected as a representative to the Second National People's Congress and appointed as Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council. The Party and the people remembered the good deeds done by Comrade Wei Lihuang for the people and gave him great trust and honor.

Zhang Zhizhong said that in the past five years, Comrade Wei Lihuang actively participated in the struggle against US imperialist aggression and the liberation of Taiwan. He was encouraged and excited by the increasing international status of the motherland, admired the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and in 1957, he strived to study at the Socialist Academy in order to better contribute to the motherland. Unfortunately, since May 1958, Comrade Wei Lihuang had been ill. In the past year, his condition had worsened, but even in his illness, Comrade Wei Lihuang still listened to important news in the newspapers every day, and he was very happy about the continuous leaps and bounds of the motherland's socialist construction cause under the brilliant light of the general line. Zhang Zhizhong finally said that Comrade Wei Lihuang joined the revolutionary ranks led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen in his youth, which can be said to be a good start; he took a long and dark reactionary road in the middle; during the Anti-Japanese War, he actively resisted the invasion of Japanese imperialism and began to do some good things for the people; and finally returned to the embrace of the motherland, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, participated in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies and the construction of the motherland, thereby achieving a good ending. On the whole, Comrade Wei Lihuang is still worthy of being a patriotic soldier, setting a good example for the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan who are still hesitating and going astray.

After the public memorial ceremony, the coffin was carried out amid funeral music, and an interment ceremony was held at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery.

    首都各界公祭卫立煌
    新华社20日讯　首都各界20日上午在中山公园中山堂公祭国防委员会副主席、全国人民代表大会代表、政协全国委员会常务委员、民革中央委员卫立煌先生。
    公祭大会由政协全国委员会主席周恩来主祭。陪祭的有：全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若、黄炎培、李维汉、陈叔通，国务院副总理陈毅、习仲勋，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，民革中央常务委员刘文辉、蒋光鼐。
    卫立煌先生的灵堂前，摆着毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席，以及党和国家的其他领导人周恩来、朱德、宋庆龄、董必武、陈云、林彪、邓小平等送的花圈。
    参加公祭大会的，有人大常委会部分委员和部分在京人民代表，政协全国委员会部分常务委员和部分在京委员，政府各部门的部分负责人，国防委员会部分委员，民革中央常务委员和中央委员，以及卫立煌先生的亲属和生前友好。
    公祭大会开始，乐队奏哀乐。主祭人周恩来向卫立煌先生的灵位献花圈。国防委员会副主席、民革中央副主席张治中致悼词。
    张治中在悼词中说，卫立煌同志青年时期，投身行伍，在孙中山先生广州大本营担任警卫，由一个普通士兵而逐渐被提升为中级军官，在他参加北伐战争时期，历任国民革命军团长、旅长、副师长等职务。蒋介石背叛革命后，他跟着走上了严重与人民为敌的道路，特别是进攻红军大别山根据地金家寨一役，对皖北人民造成了十分惨重的灾难。这是卫立煌同志不能不感到内疚而引以为憾的。
    张治中说，在抗日战争初期，卫立煌同志历任第二战区副司令长官和第一战区司令长官兼冀察战区总司令，亲眼看到共产党和毛主席团结抗日政策的英明和伟大，亲眼看到八路军对敌的英勇斗争，得到了许多的启示和教育，同八路军建立了良好的合作关系，从而有利于八路军开展对日的斗争。卫立煌同志对抗日战争是有功的，他当时的爱国行动是值得称道的。
    张治中说，抗日战争胜利以后，蒋介石在美帝国主义的支持下，发动了反共、反人民的全面内战，人民解放军及时地给以了强有力的反击。蒋介石为了援救东北失败的局面，曾派卫立煌同志担任东北“剿总司令”。当时卫立煌同志鉴于大势已去，没有积极执行蒋介石作垂死挣扎的“反攻”命令。蒋介石把东北的失败归罪于卫立煌同志，将他软禁于南京；直到蒋介石下野时，才获释放而出走香港。从此，卫立煌同志同蒋介石反动集团割断了联系。
    张治中说，1949年，中华人民共和国成立，卫立煌同志从香港致电毛主席表示祝贺。1954年，中国人民在完成三大运动和三反五反运动的基础上，各方面的事业突飞猛进，人民政权日益巩固，国际地位空前提高，党和政府发出了解放台湾和爱国一家的号召；卫立煌同志于1955年3月回到了祖国的怀抱，并且发表“告台湾袍泽朋友书”，称赞祖国在毛主席和共产党的领导下，突飞猛进，史无前例，指出国民党起义将领受到一视同仁的待遇，希望在台湾的朋友及早醒悟，不要沉沦毁灭。党和人民欢迎卫立煌同志这一爱国的正义行动。张治中说，卫立煌同志回到祖国怀抱以后，即被推选为政协全国委员会常务委员，国防委员会委员，1959年，又当选为第二届全国人民代表大会代表，被任命为国防委员会副主席，党和人民记住卫立煌同志为人民作的好事，给了他以极大的信任和荣誉。
    张治中说，五年来，卫立煌同志积极参加反对美帝国主义侵略和解放台湾的斗争，对于祖国国际地位的日益提高感到鼓舞和兴奋，敬佩党和毛主席的英明领导，并且于1957年争取到社会主义学院学习，以便更好地为祖国贡献力量。不幸从1958年5月起，卫立煌同志就一直卧病，近一年来，病势转剧，可是在病中，卫立煌同志每天仍然要听报上的重大消息，对于祖国社会主义建设事业在总路线的光辉照耀下，不断的跃进再跃进，感到十分的高兴。张治中最后说，卫立煌同志青年时期参加了孙中山先生领导的革命队伍，可谓善始；中间走了一段漫长黑暗的反动道路；在抗日战争时期，积极抵抗了日本帝国主义的侵略，并从此开始为人民做了一些好事；最后终于回到祖国怀抱，在毛主席和共产党的领导下，参加了反对国内外敌人的斗争和祖国的建设事业，从而得到了善终。总的说来，卫立煌同志仍不愧为一个爱国军人，为至今还徘徊歧途的台湾国民党军政人员树立了一个良好的榜样。
    公祭大会结束以后，在哀乐声中起灵，到八宝山烈士公墓举行了安灵仪式。
