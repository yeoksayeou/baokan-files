Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi convened the seventh regular convention of the Liberal Democratic Party today, plotting to force the Diet to approve the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Nobusuke Kishi, who also serves as president of the Liberal Democratic Party, spoke at the meeting, demanding that the Liberal Democratic Party members "unite as a party" to secure Diet approval of the treaty. Concerned that those within the Liberal Democratic Party who are dissatisfied with Kishi might adopt a passive attitude, Kishi emphasized at the meeting, "Once a party resolution is made, the entire party should execute it uniformly." Kishi also stated at the meeting that he would suppress the movement against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. He said, "Planned sabotage activities by labor unions and students should be eliminated." He clamored to "fundamentally study the current education system" and establish so-called "moral principles of the conservative party" to strengthen the indoctrination of militarist ideology.

Based on Kishi's instructions, the Liberal Democratic Party's congress passed guidelines on policy, organization, and propaganda work. The meeting also passed a resolution on concealing the aggressive nature of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Kyodo News Agency said that although this congress has ostensibly strengthened the lineup to deal with the regular Diet session for approving the security treaty with the unity of the whole party, considering the complex activities of various factions within the party unfolding on the issue of the next president, which have gradually surfaced since this year, it seems impossible to say that the lineup has been completely strengthened by this party congress. The news agency believes that "it is difficult to predict what attitude the anti-mainstream faction will take during the Diet deliberations (on the new treaty)." According to a report by the Radio Japan shortwave broadcasting station, before the congress was held, figures from the Ikeda, Ishii, Matsumura, Miki, and Ishibashi factions of the Liberal Democratic Party gathered in Tokyo yesterday to exchange views on the political situation after Nobusuke Kishi's return from the United States. They agreed to firmly oppose Kishi's re-election as president.

    日本自由民主党召开大会
    策划强使国会批准日美“安全条约”
    共同社认为“反主流派”态度尚难预料
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介今天召集自由民主党举行第七次定期大会，策划强使国会批准日美军事同盟条约。
    兼任自由民主党总裁的岸信介在会上讲话，要求自由民主党的党员们“全党一致地”使国会批准这项条约。由于担心自由民主党内对岸信介不满的人士采取消极态度，岸信介在会上强调说，“一旦作出了党的决议，全党就应该一致地执行。”岸信介在会上还表示要镇压反对日美军事同盟条约的运动。他说，“应该排除工会和学生的有计划的破坏活动”。他叫嚷要“从根本研究现行教育制度”，树立所谓“保守政党的道德”，来加强灌输军国主义思想。
    根据岸信介这种指示，自由民主党的大会通过了关于政策、组织和宣传工作的方针。会议还通过了关于掩饰新日美“安全条约”的侵略本质的决议。
    共同社说，这次大会虽然在表面上已经充实了全党一致地应付批准安全条约的国会平时会议的阵容，但是把从今年以来逐渐趋于表面化的党内各派在下届总裁这个问题上展开的复杂活动联系起来加以考虑，好像不能说由于这次党大会已经完全充实了阵容。这家通讯社认为，“在国会审议（新条约）的过程中，反主流派将采取什么态度，是很难预料的。”据日本短波广播公司电台报道，在召开这次大会以前，自由民主党的池田、石井、松村、三木、石桥等派人士昨天在东京集会，就岸信介访美回国后的政局问题交换了意见。他们商定，坚决反对岸信介再次连任总裁。
