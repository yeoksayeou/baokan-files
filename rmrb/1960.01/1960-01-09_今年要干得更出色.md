    Striving for Even Greater Achievements This Year
    Editor:
    The year of the Great Leap Forward, 1959, has passed. Thanks to the Party's nurturing, I completed four years and one month's worth of work in the past year and gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. Now, the great year of 1960 has arrived. Let me tell you how I spent the first two days of this year, and I also want to tell you my plans for this year.
    On New Year's Day, as I was preparing for a "flying start," I received a notice to attend the provincial New Year's gathering. To ensure both a flying start and participation in the gathering, I went to work early that day and focused my energy on accomplishing eight hundred and sixty minutes of work in eighty minutes. To ensure that the entire work section had a complete success, I also helped milling worker Old Sheng improve the tool die for milling nuts, increasing efficiency threefold. On this day, I not only achieved a flying start with full effort but also happily participated in the gathering.
    On the second day, our workshop was filled with the sounds of gongs and drums as everyone reported good news to the leaders. Section Chief Wang Zhenrong said to me, "Little Qu, let's have another Great Leap Forward today!" I said, "Okay!" On this day, I used seven hours to complete one hundred hours' worth of tasks.
    To continuously progress, I have decided to study Chairman Mao's works diligently this year, pay close attention to national affairs, constantly improve my awareness, and always maintain full enthusiasm. I will also humbly learn from others' rich production experience and help others with what I know, improving together. At the same time, I plan to put more effort into technological innovation. Throughout the year, I plan to innovate fifty tools and rely on them to strive to complete six years' worth of work in the whole year.

### 今年要干得更出色

    今年要干得更出色编辑同志：
    大跃进的1959年过去了，由于党的培养，我在去年一年完成了四年零一个多月的工作量，并且光荣地参加了中国共产党。现在，伟大的1960年到来了。让我告诉你们我是怎样度过今年开门头两天的，同时我还想告诉你们我今年的打算。
    元旦那天，我正准备“开门红”时，接到了一个通知，要我参加省里团拜联欢会。为了既保证开门红，又要参加联欢，那一天我提前上班，集中精力用八十分钟的时间干出了八百六十分钟的活；为了全工段满堂红，我又帮助铣工老盛改进了铣螺帽的工具胎，提高了工效三倍。这一天，我既鼓足干劲地做到了开门红，又愉快地参加了联欢会。
    二日那天，我们车间锣鼓喧天，大伙纷纷向领导报喜，段长王振荣对我说：“小曲，今天再来个大跃进吧！”我说：“好！”这一天，我用了七小时，完成了一百小时的任务。
    为了永远不断地进步，我决定在今年认真学习毛主席的著作，经常关心国家大事，不断提高自己的觉悟，永远保持十足干劲。我还要虚心学习别人的丰富生产经验，并把自己会的帮助别人，共同提高。同时我准备把更多的精力放在技术革新上。全年，我计划革新五十项工具，并依靠它们来争取全年完成六年工作量。
