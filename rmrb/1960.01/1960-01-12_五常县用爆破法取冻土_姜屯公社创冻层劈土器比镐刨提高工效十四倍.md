    Wuchang County Uses Blasting Method to Extract Frozen Soil
    Jiangtun Commune Creates Frozen Layer Splitting Device, Increasing Efficiency Fourteen Times Compared to Pickaxe Digging
    (Our report) In the campaign for high-efficiency, high-quality, and safe winter water conservancy construction, Wuchang County, Heilongjiang, taking advantage of the hardness of frozen soil in winter, widely promoted the blasting method of extracting soil, turning unfavorable winter conditions into favorable ones, and increasing soil extraction efficiency by several or dozens of times.
    According to incomplete statistics from this county by the end of December last year, more than 40 tons of explosives were used on various water conservancy construction sites, with a total of more than 5,100 blasts, blasting a total of 450,000 cubic meters of soil and rock. Each kilogram of explosive averaged 9.2 cubic meters of soil broken, with the highest blasting efficiency being 23.4 cubic meters per kilogram. At the "August 1st" Reservoir construction site in Shahezi Commune, 7.5 kilograms of explosives were used to blast more than 60 cubic meters of frozen soil in one blast, which is equivalent to the work of more than 50 people digging soil by hand for a day. In the Shuangxing team of the Red Flag Canal water conservancy construction site, 75 kilograms of explosives were used to blast 940 cubic meters of stones, which is equivalent to the work of 1,880 people manually breaking stones for a day. Due to the promotion of the blasting method of extracting soil, efficiency has been improved, and the masses have more confidence in completing the water conservancy construction tasks. They reflected: The sound of the cannon boosts morale; not afraid of hard soil and rock, guaranteeing the completion of tasks.
    After proposing the initiative of high-efficiency, high-quality, and safe winter water conservancy construction to all brother cities and counties in the province, this county widely reformed water conservancy construction tools. Many construction sites quickly realized the railization and vehicleization of soil transportation, and the ice track sledding, increasing soil transportation efficiency by one to more than ten times compared to before construction. In this situation, the soil extraction process could not meet the requirements. The county party committee timely proposed making a big effort in the soil extraction process. Based on the experience of 1958, in addition to manufacturing and promoting soil splitting devices and promoting the crowbar soil extraction method, the blasting soil extraction method was vigorously promoted on the construction sites. In the spirit of indigenous methods and the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, the construction sites successively established more than 40 factories for manufacturing blasting materials. The broad masses of commune members displayed a daring and capable style, solving the problem of raw material sources for manufacturing explosives, detonators, and fuses. The County Water Conservancy Bureau also adopted the method of going deep into key areas and summarizing experience, training more than 360 technicians, and using these people as instructors, training more than 2,300 blasters and technical personnel for manufacturing blasting materials at the construction sites.
    Now this county has prepared 570 tons of explosive raw materials. The vast majority of the county's water conservancy construction project volume of more than 5 million cubic meters of frozen soil layer can be blasted for soil extraction.
    (Our report) In the high tide of water conservancy construction in Heishan County, Liaoning, the promotion of the suspended hammer type fast frozen layer splitting device created by Jiangtun People's Commune broke through the difficulties of winter construction and greatly accelerated the progress of the project.
    In the large-scale river network project, Jiangtun People's Commune first grasped the key to determining the speed of the project—the problem of breaking the frozen soil layer. In the early stage of construction, the commune members used large picks to break the frozen soil layer, and the efficiency was very low, with each person digging only about two cubic meters of soil per day. Based on this situation, the commune party committee strengthened the leadership of the reform of water conservancy construction tools, and timely convened the on-site technical innovation committee to mobilize the masses to reform soil breaking tools. At the meeting, the workers of the commune's agricultural tool factory and wood factory proposed: Can we adopt the method of driving bridge piers to solve the problem of breaking the frozen soil layer? The party committee encouraged the workers to boldly experiment. After a night of research, the workers made drawings, and after a day and night of manufacturing, they finally created a suspended hammer type fast frozen layer splitting device. After field experiments, the effect was very good. Four people operated it (two people pulling the hammer, one person controlling the direction rod and iron wedge, and one person prying the frozen soil blocks), and they could split about 120 cubic meters of frozen soil layer in ten hours, with an average of 30 cubic meters of soil completed per person, increasing the efficiency by 14 times compared to using a pickaxe.
    The characteristics of this tool are: simple to make, easy to use, highly efficient, and widely applicable. Now, this commune has manufactured 143 units, which has greatly accelerated the progress of the river network project. The average efficiency of the entire construction site has increased from 3.3 cubic meters of soil per person per day to 7 cubic meters of soil. (Attached picture)

    五常县用爆破法取冻土
    姜屯公社创冻层劈土器比镐刨提高工效十四倍
    本报讯　黑龙江五常县在开展冬修水利高工效、优质量、保安全的运动中，借冬季冻土坚硬的特点，广泛推行了爆破取土法，变冬季不利条件为有利条件，取土工效几倍、几十倍地提高。
    这个县到去年12月下旬的不完全统计，各水利工地共使用了四十多吨炸药，共放了五千一百多炮，爆破土石共达四十五万方。每公斤炸药平均破土九点二方，其中爆破效率最高的每公斤爆破二十三点四方。沙河子公社“八一”水库工地用七点五公斤炸药，一炮就破冻土六十多方，等于五十多人手工刨土一天的工作量。红旗运河水利工地双兴中队用七十五公斤炸药炸石头九百四十方，等于一千八百八十人用手工打石头的一天工作量。由于推行爆破取土法，工效提高，广大群众对完成水利建设任务信心更足了，他们反映说：炮声响，干劲涨；不怕土石硬，完成任务有保证。
    这个县在向全省各兄弟市县提出冬修水利高工效、优质量、保安全的倡议之后，广泛地改革水利施工工具，许多工地很快的实现了运土轨道化、车子化，冰道爬犁化，运土效率比开工前提高一倍到十几倍。在这种情况下取土这道工序不能适应要求了。县委及时提出了在取土这道工序上大作文章，根据1958年的经验除了制造与推广劈土器和推行撬杆取土法外，大力在工地上推行了爆破取土法。各工地本着土法上马，土洋结合的精神，先后在施工现场办起了四十多处制造爆破物资的工厂。广大社员发挥了敢想敢干的风格，解决了制造炸药、雷管、导火线等原料来源问题。县水利局还采取了深入重点，总结经验的办法，训练了三百六十多名技术员，并以这些人为教员，在工地上先后培训出二千三百多名爆破手和制造爆破物资的技术人材。
    现在这个县已准备了五百七十吨炸药原料，全县水利建设工程量中的五百多万方冻土层，绝大部分都可以实行爆破取土。
    本报讯　辽宁黑山县在水利建设高潮中，推广了姜屯人民公社创造的吊锤式快速冻层劈土器，突破了冬季施工的困难，大大加快了工程进度。
    姜屯人民公社在大搞河网工程中，首先抓住了决定工程速度的关键——破冻土层问题。在施工初期，社员们用大镐破冻土层，工效很低，每人每天只刨两立方土左右。根据这种情况，公社党委加强了对水利建设施工工具改革的领导，及时召开了工地技术革新委员会，发动群众改革破土工具。会上，公社农具厂和木工厂工人们提出：能不能采取打桥墩子那样办法，来解决破冻土层问题？党委鼓励工人大胆试验。职工们经过一晚上的钻研，制出了图纸，又经过一昼夜的制造，终于创造出命名为吊锤式快速冻层劈土器一台。经过实地实验，效果很好，四个人操作（两人拉吊锤、一人掌握方向杆和铁楔子、一人拨冻土块），十小时可劈冻土层一百二十立方土左右，平均每人完成三十立方土，比用镐刨提高工效十四倍。
    这个工具特点是：制作简单，使用轻便，效率较高，使用范围广。现在，这个社已制造出一百四十三台，大大加快了河网工程进度，全工地平均工效由原来每天每人三点三立方土，提高到七立方土。（附图片）
