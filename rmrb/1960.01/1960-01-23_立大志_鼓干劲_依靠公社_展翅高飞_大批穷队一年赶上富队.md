(Xinhua News Agency report compilation) After a year of people's communes, many production teams (formerly advanced cooperatives) with relatively slow economic development, aiming high and boosting morale to catch up with the advanced, have realized their desire to transform from poor to rich. According to incomplete statistics, two-thirds of the poor teams in Jilin, Shanxi, Liaoning, and Shanghai have caught up with the local rich teams. In Guangxi, Hebei, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia, about half of the poor teams have caught up with the local rich teams. In Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Ningxia, one-third of the poor teams have caught up with the local rich teams. The so-called poor teams catching up with rich teams mainly refers to the level of average income of the commune members catching up with the rich teams. Now these production teams are continuing to promote the spirit of hard struggle. Under the unified leadership and assistance of the people's communes, they are actively preparing for spring plowing in the ongoing winter production campaign, striving for the continued comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year.

The formation of these poor teams was due to many objective conditions and historical reasons. For example, before communization, there were fewer basic farmland constructions, and water, soil, and fertilizer problems were not solved; there were many natural disasters and low production levels; there were few production methods, simple business projects, and low income; the cadres were weaker, and subjective efforts were insufficient, etc. During the period of advanced cooperatives, although these poor teams were developing production year by year, and their income was increasing year by year, they could not fundamentally change their poor state due to their small organizational scale, narrow scope of activities, simple operations, and weak strength.

The establishment of people's communes has created unprecedentedly favorable development conditions for these poor teams. Therefore, the movement of poor teams catching up with rich teams surged in the countryside.

In the movement of poor catching up with rich, the people's communes gave great help to the poor teams in terms of capital, production, and technology, giving full play to the advantages of being "larger in size and having a higher degree of public ownership," which is an important condition for the rapid transformation of the poor teams from poor to rich. Because the poor teams lacked production funds, they had long-term difficulties in production investment and the development of diversified operations. Therefore, many communes used their accumulation to help them overcome difficulties. In the past year, eleven communes such as Zong'ai Commune in Yuci City, Shanxi Province, and Guoyang Commune in Pingyuan County took more than 230,000 yuan from the commune's economic income to help poor teams build farmland water conservancy, and purchased 45 various machines and agricultural implements and more than 200 large livestock. The communes in Lufeng County, Guangdong Province, allocated more than 1.1 million yuan to support 72 poor teams in vigorously developing production. Some communes in Ningxia also took care of the poor teams when dealing with the ratio of accumulation and distribution in income distribution, and reduced the amount of public accumulation. In the use of tractors, new agricultural tools, and draught animals, they also tried their best to meet the needs of the poor teams. With the strong support of the communes, many poor teams have undertaken things that could not be done in the period of advanced cooperatives. The results are particularly remarkable in the transformation of nature and basic farmland construction. In Taojiaqiao and Dongjingwan and other poor teams in Miaoqiao Commune, Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, drought and flood disasters were serious in the past, and the output was not high. During the advanced cooperative period, they wanted to repair a long-term disrepair "Xi Yangtang" of ten miles, but due to lack of manpower, they never started. Last year, the commune party committee organized large-scale cooperation among the production teams, dispatching more than 3,000 laborers to repair it in ten days, freeing more than 15,000 mu of farmland from the threat of drought and flood. In 1934, there were only 38 days of drought here, and a large area of rice fields was completely lost. Last year, there was 80 days of severe drought here, and the rice was completely harvested, with a yield of 850 catties per mu, catching up with the rich teams. In helping the poor teams catch up with the rich teams, the communes in the suburbs of Shanghai specially allocated the poor teams to grow more vegetables, melons and fruits, and other crops with higher income when uniformly planning crop planting; the communes purchased large-scale agricultural machinery to plow the land for the poor teams, and installed water pumps for the poor teams; the communes' nurseries, fish seed farms, hatcheries, and breeding farms also continuously supplied the poor teams with fruit tree seedlings, young animals, and fish fry. Under the unified leadership, people's communes in various places also organized large-scale mutual assistance and cooperation in accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange, and mobilized the poor and the rich to help each other and make progress together. Chaoyang Brigade of Yanghe Commune in Yongning County, Ningxia, was unable to complete the task of plowing and fertilizer delivery due to insufficient manpower, livestock power, and transportation tools. Yanghe and Yongfeng, two rich teams, sent labor, livestock, and carts to help Chaoyang Brigade plow 165 mu of land and delivered manure fertilizer to the fields in a timely manner. In the past, Chaoyang Brigade could not afford to run a farm tool factory due to lack of funds and technical personnel. If the farm tools were broken, they had to go to the county seat for repairs, which often delayed production. After the communization, Beiquan Brigade took the initiative to send technical workers, bringing a complete set of furnaces and tools to help them run a farm tool repair shop, and was responsible for training technical workers.

Poor teams aiming high, boosting morale, and highly promoting the spirit of hard work and self-reliance are another important condition for transforming from poor to rich. After learning from the experience of Jianming Commune in running the commune frugally, many poor teams in Hebei Province greatly boosted their revolutionary spirit, worked hard, practically, and cleverly, and were determined to catch up with the rich teams. Taking Jianming Commune as an example, Shijingcun Commune in Hejian County greatly changed the low-lying land, dug more than a dozen ditches, washed alkali and suppressed alkali for more than 1,000 mu, ensuring a bumper harvest of summer and autumn crops, and at the same time engaged in six kinds of sideline production, solving the difficulties of production funds. Menggan Brigade, a Yao ethnic group settlement in Fengshan County, Guangxi, worked hard and strengthened themselves. Commune members went up the mountains in teams and dug stones from the slopes to build more than 5,000 retaining walls, turning 800 mu of mountain fields into terraced fields; more than 100 ditches were dug, turning a large area of dry land into paddy fields, making the team's production achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest, changing the situation of grain shortage over the years, and exceptionally selling 170,000 catties of surplus grain to the state. In order to change the poor situation, the cadres of many poor teams have shared weal and woe with the commune members, working diligently and frugally, leading by example, uniting the masses, overcoming all difficulties, and constantly moving forward.

In the movement of poor catching up with rich, the party committees in various places strengthened the leadership of the poor teams. The first is to select capable cadres with rich mass work experience and production experience to work in the poor teams for a long time. The Liaocheng area of Shandong Province transferred more than 1,700 cadres with rich mass work experience and production experience to work in more than 1,200 poor teams, and they remained there for a long time. In the spring of last year, Yongji County in Jilin Province sent more than 240 cadres to strengthen the specific leadership of the poor teams. Many county party committees and commune party committees also listed helping the poor teams catch up with the rich teams as an important topic, discussed them regularly, and checked them frequently. Due to the strengthening of leadership, many poor teams quickly found the root causes of poverty and effective ways to change their situation. While strengthening the leadership of the poor teams in various places, the state also provided the poor teams with a large amount of loan assistance. In 1959, Guangdong Province allocated 51 million yuan to support the poor teams in developing production; the loans issued to the poor teams in Pingliang, Wushan, and Qingshui counties and cities in Gansu Province last year reached more than 1.5 million yuan. This kind of support not only solved the difficulties in the production of the poor teams in a timely manner, but also laid a material foundation for the poor teams to expand reproduction and carry out basic farmland construction in a planned way.

At present, although there are still some poor teams that have not caught up with the rich teams, in the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, production has also been significantly improved and living standards have also been greatly improved. According to the calculations of Dongshan, Hongqi, Nanfeng, and Dalu four communes in Hainan Island, Guangdong Province: In 1958, the income difference between the poor teams and the rich teams was 84%; now, in addition to those who have caught up with the rich teams, the income gap between the poor teams and the rich teams has been reduced to 58%, and the income of these poor teams has exceeded the level of ordinary production teams in 1958.

    立大志　鼓干劲　依靠公社　展翅高飞
    大批穷队一年赶上富队
    本报综合新华社消息　人民公社化一年，许多经济发展比较缓慢的生产队（原高级社），立大志，鼓干劲，赶先进，已经实现了由穷变富的愿望。据不完全统计，吉林、山西、辽宁、上海市有三分之二的穷队赶上了当地的富队，广西、河北、甘肃、内蒙古有半数上下的穷队赶上了当地的富队，广东、江苏、宁夏有三分之一的穷队赶上了当地的富队。所谓穷队赶上了富队，主要是指社员平均收入的水平赶上了富队。现在这些生产队正继续发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，在人民公社的统一领导和帮助下，在热火朝天的冬季生产运动中，积极准备春耕，争取今年农业生产继续全面跃进。
    这些穷队的形成有许多客观条件和历史原因。例如，在公社化以前农田基本建设较少，水、土、肥没有过关；自然灾害多，生产水平低；生产门路少，经营项目单纯，收入少；干部较弱，主观努力不够等。在高级社时期，尽管这些穷队生产逐年在发展，收入逐年有增加，但由于组织规模小、活动范围窄、经营单纯、力量薄弱，无法从根本上改变穷困面貌。
    人民公社的建立，给这些穷队创造了空前有利的发展条件。因此，穷赶富运动一时澎湃农村。
    在穷赶富运动中，人民公社发挥一大二公的优越性，在资金上、生产上、技术上给予穷队极大的帮助，是穷队迅速由穷变富的一个重要条件。穷队由于生产资金缺少，在生产投资和开展多种经营上长期存在着困难。因此，很多公社都利用公社的积累帮助他们克服困难。山西榆次市宗艾公社和平原县崞阳公社等十一个公社，在去年一年中即从公社经济收入中拿出二十三万多元，帮助穷队兴修农田水利，并购置各种机器农具四十五部、大牲畜二百多头。广东陆丰县各公社抽出一百一十多万元，支援七十二个穷队大力发展生产。宁夏有些公社还在收益分配中处理积累和分配的比例时，照顾穷队，少提一些公共积累。在拖拉机、新式农具和耕畜的使用方面，也尽可能满足穷队的需要。在公社的大力支援下，许多穷队举办了过去高级社时期办不到的事情。在改造自然和农田基本建设方面，成效特别显著。江苏常熟县妙桥公社陶家桥、洞泾湾等穷队，过去旱涝灾害严重，产量不高，高级社时曾想整修一条年久失修的十里长“西暘塘”，由于人力单薄，始终没有动手。去年，公社党委组织各生产队大协作，出动三千多劳力，十天就修好了，使周围一万五千多亩农田解除了旱涝灾害的威胁。1934年这里只有三十八天干旱，大片稻田全部失收；去年这里八十天大旱，水稻全部丰收，亩产达到八百五十斤，赶上了富队。上海市郊各公社在帮助穷队赶富队工作中，在统一规划作物种植时，特别分配穷队多种蔬菜瓜果等收益较大的作物；公社购买了大型农业机械为穷队翻地，给穷队安装抽水机；公社的苗圃、鱼种场、孵房、种畜场也不断供给穷队果树苗、仔畜、鱼种。各地人民公社还在统一领导下，按照等价交换的原则，组织了大规模的互助协作，发动穷富互相帮助，共同跃进。宁夏永宁县养和公社的朝阳大队，因人力、畜力和运输工具不足，翻地、送肥任务难以完成。养和、永丰两个富队就派了劳力、畜力、大车帮助朝阳大队翻地一百六十五亩，并及时将粪肥送到田间。过去朝阳大队因资金不足和缺乏技术人员，办不起农具厂，农具坏了要到县城去修理，经常耽误生产；公社化后，北全大队主动派去技术工人，带上全套熔炉、工具，帮助他们办起一个农具修配厂，并负责培养技术工人。
    穷队立大志，鼓干劲，高度发扬艰苦奋斗自力更生的精神，是由穷变富另一个重要条件。河北省许多穷队学习了建明公社勤俭办社的经验后，大鼓革命干劲，苦干、实干、巧干，一心赶上富队。河间县诗经村公社以建明公社为榜样，大改洼地，挖渠十多条，洗碱压碱一千多亩，保证了夏秋作物大丰收，同时搞起了六种副业生产，解决了生产资金困难。广西凤山县瑶族聚居的猛干大队，发奋图强，社员结队上山，把石头从坡地上挖出来，砌成五千多条围墙，把八百亩山田变成梯田；开挖百多条水沟，变大片旱田为水田，使全队生产获得空前丰收，改变了历年缺粮状况，破例卖给国家余粮十七万斤。许多穷队干部为改变穷困面貌，都做到与社员同甘共苦，一干二勤三俭，以身作则，团结群众，排除万难，不断前进。
    在穷赶富运动当中，各地党委都加强了对穷队的领导。首先是选派得力干部长期驻穷队帮助工作。山东聊城专区抽调一千七百多个富有群众工作经验和生产经验的干部到一千二百多个穷队工作，长期不动。吉林永吉县去年春天即派出二百四十多名干部加强穷队具体领导。许多县委和公社党委还把帮助穷队赶富队列为重要议题，定期讨论，经常检查。由于领导力量的加强，许多穷队迅速找出致穷的根本原因，和改变面貌的有效方法。各地在加强穷队领导的同时，国家还给予穷队以大量贷款援助。1959年，广东省拨出五千一百万元扶助穷队发展生产；甘肃平凉、武山、清水三县市去年发放给穷队的贷款达一百五十多万元。这种支援不但及时解决了穷队生产中的困难，还为穷队扩大再生产和有计划进行农田基本建设打下了物质基础。
    目前，虽然还有一部分穷队没有赶上富队，但是，在连续两年大跃进中，生产也有显著的提高，生活也有很大的改善。据东广海南岛东山、红旗、南丰、大路四个公社计算：1958年穷队和富队的收入相差84％；现在，除已赶上富队的以外，穷队和富队的收入的差距已缩小为58％，而且这些穷队的收入都超过了1958年一般生产队的水平。
