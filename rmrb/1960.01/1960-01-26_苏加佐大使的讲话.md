Ambassador Sukarno's Speech

Your Excellency Foreign Minister Chen Yi:

Nearly five years have passed since the first Asian-African conference in human history was held in Bandung by independent Asian and African nations. Coinciding with this historically significant gathering of Asian and African countries was an event of no less importance: the signing of a treaty between the representatives of the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China to abolish dual nationality. This treaty is not only a concrete manifestation of the Bandung spirit and principles, but also a good example and model for East Asian countries to resolve the issue of overseas Chinese.

Your Excellency, as we approach the fifth anniversary of the signing of the aforementioned treaty in Bandung between our two countries, we have finally exchanged the instruments of ratification of the treaty. Five years is indeed not a short time, but we are very pleased that the time has now come when we can immediately begin to resolve the issue of dual nationality between our two countries.

Indeed, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia has always believed that a person should only have one nationality, because dual nationality can only result in dual loyalties. The existence of dual nationality not only creates many very troublesome problems for those concerned, but also creates international disputes; once two countries simultaneously demand loyalty to them, and the two countries concerned have not established a solid friendly relationship, this problem may be difficult to resolve. In addition, we must also remember that dual nationality has given opportunists considerable opportunities to engage in activities that are not suitable for the situation in an independent Indonesia.

The Indonesian government and people are gratified that the People's Republic of China, as a country opposed to capitalism, has also demonstrated its firm stance in jointly ending the dual nationality status of overseas Chinese in Indonesia with the Government of the Republic of Indonesia. The Indonesian government and people are pleased to hear the repeated statements of Chinese leaders, including His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai and Your Excellency Foreign Minister Chen Yi himself, that those who choose the nationality of the Republic of Indonesia in the future should earnestly abide by this treaty, enhance their sense of responsibility towards Indonesia, and participate in consolidating the friendship between the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China.

The above statement truly conforms to the position and hopes of the Indonesian government and nation. It is hoped that the implementation of the treaty to abolish dual nationality will be able to eliminate the problems existing between our two countries, thereby making the friendship between Indonesia and the People's Republic of China more solid, and also making the friendship and peace among Asian countries and world peace and friendship increasingly consolidated.

### 苏加佐大使的讲话

    苏加佐大使的讲话外交部长陈毅阁下：
    在人类历史上第一次在万隆举行了全亚洲和非洲独立国家的会议，迄今将近五年了。正好在这个极有历史意义的亚非各国举行聚会的同时，发生了一件意义不亚于此的事件，这就是印度尼西亚共和国代表和中华人民共和国代表签订了废除双重国籍的条约。这个条约不仅是万隆精神和原则的具体表现，而且也成为东亚各国解决华侨问题的良好榜样和范例。
    阁下，在我们两国在万隆签订上述条约已届五年之际，我们终于互换了条约的批准书。五年的时间的确不算短，虽然如此，我们感到非常高兴的是：现在已经到了我们可以立即开始进行解决我们两国之间的双重国籍问题的活动的时候。
    诚然，印度尼西亚共和国政府自始认为，任何人只能具有一种国籍，因为双重国籍，事实上只能产生双重的效忠。存在双重国籍不仅给有关者造成许多非常麻烦的问题，而且也会产生国际纠纷；一旦两个国家同时都要求效忠于它们，而有关的两个国家没有建立巩固的友好关系的话，这个问题就可能很难得到解决。此外，我们还必须记住，双重国籍已经给机会主义分子以不少的机会来进行不适合于已经独立了的印度尼西亚的情况的活动。
    印度尼西亚政府和人民感到庆幸的是，中华人民共和国作为反对资本主义的国家，也表明了它同印度尼西亚共和国政府共同结束在印度尼西亚的华侨存在双重国籍的状况的坚定立场。印度尼西亚政府和人民愉快地听到中国的首长们，其中包括周恩来总理阁下和陈毅外交部长阁下本人的屡次声明，即将来选择了印度尼西亚共和国国籍的人们应该认真地遵守此条约，增强他们对印度尼西亚的责任感和参与巩固印度尼西亚共和国和中华人民共和国之间的友谊。
    上述声明是真正符合印度尼西亚政府和民族的立场和希望的。希望废除双重国籍的条约的实施，将能够消除我们两国之间存在的问题，从而使印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国之间的友谊更加牢固，并且也使亚洲各国之间的友谊和和平以及世界和平和友好日益巩固。
