　　Another Large-Scale Project to Thoroughly Harness the Yellow River
　　Wangwangzhuang Hub Project Starts Construction
　　Another large-scale project in Shandong Province to thoroughly harness the Yellow River – the Wangwangzhuang Hub Project – has officially commenced construction recently, following the successful closure of the Weishan Hub Project.
　　This hub project is located between the four counties of Zhanhua, Guangrao, Boxing, and Huimin in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, 120 kilometers from the Yellow River estuary, and is the last-level hub project on the Yellow River. The entire project includes the Dayuzhang Diversion Gate, the Handun Diversion Gate, the River-Blocking Gate, the River-Blocking Dam, the Shunhuang Ship Lock, the Chuanhuang Ship Lock, the Sand Prevention Gate, and a power station. The Dayuzhang and Handun Diversion Gates were completed in 1956 and 1958, respectively. The River-Blocking Gate is built on the beach opposite Dayuzhang, with a total length of 280 meters and a discharge capacity of 6,000 cubic meters per second, with a maximum discharge capacity of 8,000 cubic meters per second. Four generators will be installed on the left side of the River-Blocking Gate, with a total power generation capacity of more than 2,600 kilowatts. The Diversion Ship Lock is parallel to the River-Blocking Gate at the current main stream of the Yellow River and can accommodate various sailboats and motor vessels with a load capacity of several hundred tons. The Chuanhuang Ship Lock is built near Daoxu to connect the shipping of the Huan (tai) - Wu (di) Canal. The Sand Prevention Gate is located at the diversion river mouth of the Handun Diversion Gate to prevent siltation in the diversion river. In addition to blocking the river and preventing floods, the River-Blocking Dam and the Flood Prevention Dike will also be used to erect light-rail tracks as a highway connecting north and south traffic.
　　The first phase of the hub closure project, which has already started, includes the River-Blocking Gate and the River-Blocking Dam, which are the key to the entire project and will be completed before the flood season.

    根治黄河的又一大型工程
    王旺庄枢纽工程动工
    山东省根治黄河的又一大型工程——王旺庄枢纽工程，继位山枢纽工程胜利截流之后，在最近正式动工兴建。
    这个枢纽工程位于黄河下游的沾化、广饶、博兴、惠民四县之间，距黄河入海口一百二十公里，是黄河最末一级枢纽工程。整个工程，包括打渔张引黄闸、韩墩引黄闸、拦河闸、拦河坝、顺黄船闸、串黄船闸、防沙闸和发电站等。打渔张、韩墩两座引黄闸已在1956年和1958年先后建成。拦河闸建筑在打渔张对岸的滩地上，全长二百八十米，泄水能力为六千秒立方米，最大泄水量为八千秒立方米。拦河闸左测将安装四台发电机，总发电能力为二千六百多瓩。引黄船闸在目前黄河主流处与拦河闸并列，能通过各种帆船和载重几百吨的机轮。串黄船闸建筑在道旭附近，以沟通桓（台）无（棣）运河的航运。防沙闸设在韩墩引黄闸的引河口处，防止引河淤积。拦河坝和防洪堤除拦河、防洪作用外，并架设轻型铁轨，作为沟通南北交通的公路。
    已经开工的枢纽截流的第一期工程，有拦河闸和拦河坝，是整个工程的关键，将在汛前竣工。
