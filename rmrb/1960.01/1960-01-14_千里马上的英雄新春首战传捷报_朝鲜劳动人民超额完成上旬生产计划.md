    This is a report from our correspondent in Pyongyang on the 13th. The Korean working people, who have mounted the Chollima horse, have achieved initial success in the first battle of the New Year. All sectors of the national economy have overfulfilled their production plans for the first ten days of January.
    The workers on Korea's iron and steel front are responding to the call of the Korean Workers' Party to increase production with existing manpower and equipment, actively shortening steelmaking time, extending furnace life, and increasing the utilization rate of various equipment. In the first ten days of this year, iron and steel workers produced more than 1,600 tons of pig iron and 1,780 tons of steel than planned. Compared with the same period last year, pig iron production increased by 1.1 times, and steel increased by 50%.
    The workers of the Seongjin Steel Plant, which actively increases the production of various special steels for manufacturing agricultural machinery in order to support agricultural mechanization, are even more enthusiastic. In the first ten days of this year, the steelmaking workshop of this plant shortened the time for each steelmaking process by 40 to 50 minutes compared with last year, resulting in an overproduction of 400 tons of steel compared to the plan.
    Now, the iron and steel workers are full of confidence and determined to increase the production of pig iron and granulated iron by 20% and steel production by 40% compared with last year.
    The coal sector also completed its plan for the first ten days, with an average daily output increase of 4,000 to 5,000 tons compared with the beginning of last year. The Sinchang Youth Coal Mine, with an annual production capacity of one million tons, vigorously promoted high-speed tunneling this New Year and adopted the method of simultaneous mining of the entire thick coal seam, bringing the daily output to 3,300 tons, exceeding the plan by 21%.
    In addition, good news also came from various cement factories, which produced more than 5,000 tons of cement more than the same period last year in the first ten days of this year.
    Fishermen on the east coast braved the high winds and waves and the cold weather to encircle and catch schools of Alaska pollock, which are currently in season. Nine aquatic product enterprises on the east coast had completed their January fishing plans ahead of schedule by the 11th. The aquatic product team of the Chongjin Aquatic Products Enterprise adapted to the migration pattern of the fish schools, rationally reorganized the labor organization, and strengthened the connection between the exploration vessels and the fishing vessels, increasing the number of nets cast each day by two compared to last year, so that each fishing vessel caught an average of 250 tons per day, with a maximum of 490 tons.
    The factories and enterprises in the light industry sector also overfulfilled their production plans by 5% in the first ten days of this year. The textile factories produced 32 tons more yarn and wove 120,000 square meters more cloth than the same period last year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang - Agricultural mechanization is the central task of Korea's economic sector this year. Since the beginning of the New Year, Korea's central and local industries have been mobilized to produce tractors, trucks, and various agricultural machinery and tools to support agricultural mechanization.
    The workers of the Kiyang Machinery Plant and the Deokcheon Automobile Factory, which successfully trial-produced tractors and trucks in 1958, carried out technical preparations in 1959, and since the beginning of this year, have been working closely with various machinery factories to launch a fiery labor competition to supply 3,000 tractors and 3,000 trucks to the countryside this year.
    The workers of the Nampo Shipyard will manufacture 2,550 trailers for tractors for the countryside this year to strengthen the transportation capacity of the countryside. The workers of the local industrial factories in Pyongyang are actively producing medium and small agricultural machinery and tools. This year, they will produce more than 4,500 units of animal-powered and manual weeding machines, threshers, and chaff cutters, and more than 2,500 trailers and oxcarts, and more than 200,000 sets of ball bearings. In addition, they will manufacture more than 340,000 pieces of agricultural tools such as shovels, hoes, plows, and plowshares, so that each worker in the agricultural cooperatives and farms in Pyongyang will have an average of more than two agricultural tools.
    The designers of the Central Design Institute of the Korean Machinery Industry Ministry are working day and night to design agricultural machinery that is good, economical, and suitable for Korea's specific conditions.

    千里马上的英雄新春首战传捷报
    朝鲜劳动人民超额完成上旬生产计划
    本报平壤13日电　跨上千里马的朝鲜劳动人民，今年新春首战告捷。国民经济各个部门都超额完成了1月份头十天的生产计划。
    朝鲜的钢铁战线上的职工们响应朝鲜劳动党提出的用现有的人力和设备增加生产的号召，积极缩短炼钢时间，延长炉的寿命，提高各种设备的利用率。在今年头十天中，钢铁工人们比原定计划多生产了一千六百多吨生铁，一千七百八十多吨钢。这十天同去年同期相比，生铁产量增加了一点一倍，钢增加了50％。
    为了支援农业机械化，积极增产各种制造农业机械用的特殊钢材的城津炼钢厂的职工们干劲更高，这个厂的炼钢车间今年头十天的每次炼钢的时间比去年缩短了四十到五十分钟，结果比计划多生产了四百吨钢。
    现在，钢铁工人满怀信心，要使今年的生铁和粒铁产量，比去年增加20％，钢产量比去年增加40％。
    煤炭部门也完成了头十天的计划，平均日产量比去年年初增加了四千吨到五千吨。年产能力达到一百万吨的新仓青年煤矿，今年新春大力推行高速掘进，并采用了厚层煤全层同时采掘法，使日产量达到三千三百吨，超额21％完成了头十天的计划。
    另外，各水泥工厂也传来了捷音，今年头十天比去年同期多生产了五千多吨水泥。
    东海岸上的渔业工人不顾风高浪大，天寒水冷，开动大队渔船围捕正值汛期的明太鱼群。东海岸有九个水产事业所，到11日为止已经提前完成了1月份的捕鱼计划。清津水产事业所的水产队适应鱼群的回游规律，合理改组了劳动组织，加强了探索船和渔船间的联系，每天比去年多起两次网，使每条渔轮平均每天捕到二百五十吨。最高达到四百九十吨。
    轻工业部门的各工厂企业今年头十天也超额5％完成了生产计划。各纺织厂比去年同期多生产了三十二吨纱，多织十二万平方米的布。
    据新华社平壤电　农业机械化是今年朝鲜经济部门的中心任务。进入新年以来，朝鲜的中央工业和地方工业都一致动员起来，生产拖拉机、载重汽车和各种农业机械、农具来支援农业机械化。
    在1958年分别试制成功拖拉机和载重汽车的岐阳机械厂和德川汽车工厂的职工们，在1959年进行了技术准备，从今年年初开始同各机械厂密切协作，为在今年生产拖拉机和载重汽车各三千台供给农村而展开了火热的劳动竞赛。
    南浦造船所的职工今年要为农村制造二千五百五十台拖拉机用的拖车，以加强农村的运输力量。平壤市的地方工业工厂的职工正积极生产中、小农业机械和农具。他们今年要生产畜力和人力的锄草机、脱谷机、铡草机等四千五百多台，生产拖车和牛车两千五百多台，滚珠轴承二十多万套；另外要制造三十四万多件锹、镐、犁、铧等农具，使平壤市的农业社和农场中的每个劳动力平均有两件以上的农具。
    朝鲜机械工业省中央设计研究所的设计人员，正在日夜奋战，设计又好又省又适合朝鲜的具体情况的农业机械。
