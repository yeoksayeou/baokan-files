    Zedang, We Sing for You
    Guo Chaoren, Ma Ningxuan, Jiang Hua
    Early winter, we arrived at the rich Nai Plain. A vast expanse of deep brown fields and villages surrounded by green forests unfolded before our eyes. The crops had just been harvested from the fields, and the ploughs had already begun to turn over patches of black soil. In the squares around the villages, golden piles of highland barley and wheat sheaves were stacked like hills.
    Following the path at the edge of the village, passing through the busy crowds, we climbed the Gangbo mountain pass. At this moment, the ancient and heroic city of Tibet – Zedang – stood before us. The green temples, white stupas, adjacent houses, verdant Tibetan willows and birch trees made the city appear tranquil and beautiful.
    An old folk song from Shannan says: "The Qimin spring water is like honey, the Yalong area is better than paradise." (Qimin Spring is a mountain spring near Zedang; the Yalong River flows around Zedang and into the Yarlung Tsangpo River.) These legends of "paradise" and "happiness" merely reflected people's hopes and aspirations for the future. Under the rule of the Tibetan serf system, Zedang was a living hell for the vast majority of serfs and slaves, with poverty, hunger, disease, death and endless disasters lurking at every moment. Now, Zedang has forever bid farewell to its tragic fate of thousands of years and is welcoming the dawn of a vibrant new life. Three hundred and sixty-seven peasant, resident and handicraft households, under the leadership of the Peasants' Association, are busily building a new life. Some of them are working intensely on the threshing ground in the suburbs. They must get the grain into the warehouse before the wind and snow arrive. For the first time in thousands of years, the grain they themselves cultivated belongs to them. In order to strive for a bumper harvest next year, their enthusiasm grows, and some have even organized mutual aid teams. The shops are displaying all kinds of goods, and all sorts of stalls are lined up on both sides of the street, attracting passing customers. In order to provide the emancipated peasants with new clothes, weavers of pulu (Tibetan woolen fabric) and shoemakers are using various methods to improve their production.
    During the democratic reforms, many former Langsheng (hereditary serfs) and Ula (corvée laborers) have settled down. "Ula" Gado and his wife Renzeng Cangmu had been married for seven years but had not been able to live together. They only had the opportunity to meet when they were working in the fields of the serf owner. Their child was born four years ago and had been living with others, never able to live with his parents for a single day. Now they have a new life. Gado is threshing grain on the threshing ground in front of the door, and Renzeng Cangmu is sitting on the doorstep spinning wool with their four-year-old child in her arms. The child's little hands are around her mother's neck, and her flushed face is pressed against her mother's chest, unwilling to leave for a moment. Renzeng Cangmu kissed the child's hair, looked up and said with a smile, "We have been hoping for a home for so many years, and now we finally have one!" In her clear eyes, we saw the immense confidence and strength that this woman, who had endured so much suffering, possessed for the future!
    A burst of silvery laughter and singing floated in the air, and a group of children skipped and jumped to school. It is said that Shannan was once the cultural center of Tibet in history, but before liberation, there was not a single school in the ancient town of Zedang. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Central People's Government opened a primary school here, but under the oppression of the serf owners, the children of serfs and slaves still had no opportunity to attend school. Now, the doors of culture have been opened, and a large number of children of working people have entered schools. Three primary schools and four cultural night schools, established by the people themselves, have also been opened one after another in recent months.
    That tall building in front is the famous Shannan Health Center. We saw many Tibetan patients from nearby villages coming here in twos and threes for treatment. The courtyard was swept clean, and Tibetan medical personnel in white coats were going in and out. In the past five months, the health center has treated more than 10,000 Tibetan patients. Tibetan and Han medical personnel have overcome numerous difficulties and have done everything possible to relieve the suffering from diseases left over by the old system. People gratefully call them "living Buddhas sent by Chairman Mao!" Across from the health center is a military hospital run by the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. A story is circulating among the people of Zedang about doctors here using their own blood to save a Tibetan baby. In early September last year, a baby in Changzhu Village in the southern suburbs of Zedang suffered from pneumonia, had a high fever, and was dying. Doctors from the hospital rushed to the scene, but the child was already in a critical condition and needed a blood transfusion. At this time, Han doctors, nurses, and other staff members all rushed to offer their own blood to save this little life, but due to blood type compatibility, only the young female doctor He Yuhuan was selected. At that time, He Yuhuan was in poor health and pregnant, but in order to save the life of the Tibetan people's son, she bravely donated her own blood. Now, the child is lively and healthy, and no one can tell that he had such a serious illness just a few months ago. But the people of Zedang know that it was because of that brave young Han woman and those kind Han doctors that this little life was saved.
    We came to the home of Sorlang Banjor, the deputy director of the Zedang Peasants' Association. From the surface, it is hard to imagine that this simple and shy middle-aged man has such a strong will. Because Sorlang Banjor's daughter was studying at the Tibet Local Cadre School, in January of last year, the rebels tied up Sorlang Banjor, paraded him through the streets carrying stones on his back, and then threw him into prison where he was held for more than three months. But Sorlang Banjor did not bow his head in the face of any torture. After the rebellion in Shannan was quelled, he actively joined the democratic reform movement with scars all over his body. We had just sat down when Gen Zeng, the director of the Peasants' Association, and other members also arrived. Gen Zeng announced that the Peasants' Association Committee would hold a meeting to discuss three issues in the current work in the Zedang area. The first issue was to reasonably adjust the technical strength and labor force of each production team in order to do a good job in autumn plowing and strive for a bumper harvest next year; the second issue was to mobilize a force to help the elderly, weak, and disabled households with autumn harvesting and threshing, so that no one's grain would suffer any loss; the third issue was to find a way to resettle the five "Lorerwa" households who had recently moved in.
    The meeting was very lively, and everyone put forward many specific methods. Gen Zeng recorded them one by one.
    It was getting late, and we said goodbye and left. The sun had already set. Purple-red sunset clouds were slanting across the western horizon, flocks of water birds were chasing and calling on the Yalong River, and the fat cattle and sheep were leisurely walking towards the village. People who had worked for a day were gathering in the streets and lanes, chatting and laughing in twos and threes. On the way back, we could still vaguely hear the rhythmic threshing and joyful singing of the farmers in the surrounding villages. Ancient Zedang, you have become so young, we want to sing for you!

    泽当，我们为你歌唱
    郭超人　马宁轩　江华
    初冬，我们来到了富庶的乃平原。一片广阔的深褐色的田野，一座座绿林环绕的村庄展现在眼前。田地上庄稼刚刚收割完毕，犁铧就开始翻卷起片片黑黝黝的土壤。村庄四周的广场上，金色的青稞和小麦禾垛堆得像山丘一样。
    沿着村头的小路，穿过繁忙的人群，爬上了冈波山口。这时，矗立在我们面前的就是西藏古老而英雄的城市——泽当。那绿色的庙宇，白色的经塔，毗连的房屋，翠绿的藏柳和白桦树，使这座城市显得静穆而秀丽。
    山南古民谣说：“齐敏泉水像蜜汁，雅砻地方赛天堂。”（齐敏泉是泽当附近一股山泉，雅砻河绕过泽当流入雅鲁藏布江）。这种“天堂”和“幸福”的传说，只不过反映了人们对未来生活的希望和憧憬。在西藏农奴制度的统治下，泽当，对于广大农奴和奴隶们却是一座活地狱，贫穷、饥饿、疾病、死亡和无尽止的灾难每时每刻窥伺着他们。现在，泽当永远告别了千百年来悲惨的命运，正迎接着朝气勃勃的新生活的曙光。三百六十七户农民、居民和手工业者，正在农民协会的领导下，为建设新的生活而忙碌着。他们有些人正在市郊的打麦场上紧张地劳动。他们要赶在风雪来到之前，把粮食收进仓库。千百年来，他们自己耕种的粮食第一次归自己所有。为了争取明年的大丰收，他们的劲头越干越足，有的还组织了互助组。商店里陈列着各种货品，街道两旁摆着五花八门的地摊，招引着来往的顾客。为了使翻身后的农民换上新装，织氆氇工人和制鞋工人在用各种办法提高自己的生产。
    在民主改革中，许多过去的朗生和乌拉安了家。“乌拉”嘎多和妻子仁增仓姆结婚七年了，但是却不能在一起生活，他们只能在农奴主的田地里劳动的时候才有机会见面，孩子出生四年，一直寄居在别人家里，没有一天能和父母住在一起。现在他们获得了新的生活。嘎多在门口打麦场上打场，仁增仓姆抱着四岁的孩子坐在门槛上捻毛线，孩子的小手搂着妈妈的脖子，通红的脸蛋贴着妈妈的胸脯，一刻也不愿离开。仁增仓姆吻了吻孩子的头发，抬起头微笑地说：“我们多少年来盼望着有一个家，现在到底有了！”在她那明澈的双眼里，我们看到了这个饱经忧患的妇女对未来生活蕴藏着多么巨大的信心和力量！
    一阵银铃般的笑声和歌声在街道上空飘荡着，一群孩子蹦着跳着上学去。据说山南在历史上曾经一度是西藏的文化中心，但泽当这座古城镇，解放前，没有一所学校，西藏和平解放后，中央人民政府在这里开办了一所小学，但在农奴主的压迫下，农奴和奴隶的子弟，仍然没机会上学。现在，文化的大门开放了，大批劳动人民的子弟进入了学校，人民群众自己兴办的三所小学和四所文化夜校，也在最近几个月来陆续开学了。
    前面那座高大的楼房，是著名的山南卫生院。我们看到，许多附近溪卡里的藏族病人正三三两两赶来这里治病，院子里打扫得干干净净，穿着白衣的藏族医务人员进进出出。近五个多月来，这所卫生院已经为藏族病人治疗了一万多人次，藏、汉族医务人员克服着重重困难，想尽千方百计为藏族同胞解除旧制度留下来的疾病的折磨，人们感激地把他们称为“毛主席派来的活菩萨”！卫生院对面有人民解放军西藏军区开办的一所军医院，在泽当的人们中传颂着一个关于这里的医生用自己的鲜血抢救藏族婴儿的故事。去年9月初，泽当南郊昌珠村的一个婴儿患了肺炎，高烧不醒，奄奄一息。这所医院的医生闻讯赶来后，孩子已相当危险，需要输血，这时，汉族医生、护士和其他工作人员一个个争着要用自己的血液来挽救这个小生命，但因为血型的关系，只选上了青年女医生何玉环。当时，何玉环身体不好，正怀着孕，但是为了挽救藏族人民的儿子的生命，她勇敢地把自己的鲜血献了出来。现在，孩子长得活泼健康，谁也看不出就在几个月前害过这样一场大病。但是泽当的人们知道，这是因为有了那个勇敢的年青的汉族妇女，那些好心的汉族医生，才保住了这个小小的生命。
    我们来到了泽当农民协会副主任索郎班觉家里，如果从表面上看，怎么也想像不到这个朴实而腼腆的中年人却有着多么刚强的意志。因为索郎班觉的女儿在西藏地方干部学校学习，去年1月，叛乱分子便把索郎班觉捆绑起来，背着石块“游街示众”，后来又把他丢进监牢里关押了三个多月，但索郎班觉在任何酷刑面前都没有低头。山南叛乱平息后，他带着满身的伤疤，积极地投入了民主改革运动。我们刚坐下不久，农会主任根增和其他的委员也来了。根增宣布农会委员会开会，讨论泽当地区当前工作中的三个问题。第一个问题，为了做好秋耕，争取明年的丰收，急需合理调整各生产小组的技术力量和劳动力；第二个问题，动员一批力量帮助老弱残废户进行秋收和打场，不让任何人的粮食受到任何损失；第三个问题，这几天新迁来的五户“洛热娃”，要想办法安置。
    会议开得很热烈，大家提出的具体办法很多，根增把它们一条一条记了下来。
    天晚了，我们告别出来。太阳已经落山了。西边天际斜抹着一朵朵紫红色的晚霞，一群群水鸟在雅砻河上追逐着，鸣叫着，肥壮的牛羊群悠闲地向村庄里走去，劳动了一天的人们，三三两两地围在街头巷尾谈笑。在回来的路上我们还隐约听到周围村庄农民们有节奏的打场声和欢唱声。古老的泽当啊，你变得这样年青，我们要为你歌唱！
