    Destroy the Bourgeois Worldview, Establish the Proletarian Worldview
    Ai Siqi
    The proletarian worldview means correctly understanding the constantly developing material world that actually exists around us, and standing together with the broad masses of the people, actively changing this world under the leadership of the Party.

    In the material world that actually exists around us, the most important thing is the brilliant victory of our socialist cause, the continuous Great Leap Forward in our socialist construction work since 1958, and the new form of social organization, the People's Commune, that arose with the Great Leap Forward. The power and source of these great achievements are the soaring enthusiasm of the hundreds of millions of people in our country, and the vanguard force leading the people to realize all these creations is the Chinese Communist Party. Its guiding ideology is the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and the creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought.

    These victories are objectively existing facts, products of objective laws. Our subjective understanding must correctly reflect the objectively existing facts and grasp the objective laws. This is the basic requirement of the proletarian worldview – dialectical materialism epistemology. The proletarian worldview especially requires us to fully estimate the great creativity of the people, and to fully recognize the great leading role of the Marxist-Leninist Party, and the great guiding role of Mao Zedong Thought, which can most fully unleash the creativity of the people. The proletarian worldview not only requires us to correctly understand actually existing objective things and objective laws, but it also requires us to be good at fully and effectively exerting man's subjective dynamic role, so that we can move from one brilliant victory to another even more brilliant victory.

    We oppose those who observe the objective world with a bourgeois worldview, because they have eyes but cannot see the objective things that actually exist around us. They ignore the brilliant victories of our socialist cause, and obliterate the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes. This is called "having no things in their eyes." They are panic-stricken in the face of mass movements, cannot see the great role of the people in creating history, cannot see the Party leading the Chinese people in changing the face of Chinese society at an unprecedented speed in the past two years, promoting the progress of Chinese society, and cannot see the correctness of the Party's General Line for socialist construction and Mao Zedong Thought. This is called "having no people in their eyes" and "having no Party in their eyes." "Having no things in their eyes," "having no people in their eyes," and "having no Party in their eyes," in a word: not having the objective world in mind, subjective consciousness not reflecting objective existence, this is the salient feature of the ideological decadence of those who cling to the bourgeois worldview, and it is the salient feature that makes them degenerate into subjective idealists.

    The reason they fall into such serious errors is that they observe the world from the standpoint of bourgeois individualism, not starting from objectively existing actual things and from the 600 million people as Comrade Mao Zedong instructed, but starting from personal calculations as the bourgeoisie usually does. Personal material or spiritual interests, personal reputation, status, material rewards, enjoyment of life, subjective prejudices, dogmatic formulas, etc., are their pointers for collecting materials and judging things. Even a temporary illusion, because of personal interests, they can publicize and exaggerate it as an eternal objective truth; even an objectively existing fact, because of personal interests, they can completely obliterate it. Why can't they correctly understand the actual things that exist around them? Because personal interest calculations hinder their subjective understanding, making it lose the ability to reflect the objective. Why can't they see the brilliant victories of the socialist cause, can't see the great creations of the people? Because the main thing they pay attention to is personal interests, "my" interests. The reason why they "have no things in their eyes," "have no people in their eyes," and "have no Party in their eyes" is that their eyes are blinded by the interests of "me," and that there is only one "me" in their eyes. This is also called "having me in their eyes." "Having me in their eyes" makes them unable to see the truth about the world around them, making the world they see only "my" world, or the world centered on "me." This is also called "solipsism." Everything that enters their minds must be filtered and refracted through the lens of "me," so the various aspects of the truth of things themselves must be absorbed, dismantled, subverted or distorted, and finally only individual, superficial sensory phenomena or illusions that are merely suitable for "my" tastes remain.

    "Me" is the source of their narrow, one-sided and chaotic sensory experience, and the standard for their erroneous judgment of problems, which treats the partial as the whole, the illusion as the essence, and the temporary as the permanent. This is their "empiricism." "Empiricism" and "solipsism" are the inseparable characteristics of their subjective idealist worldview.

    The socialist cause we are currently facing is an unprecedentedly large-scale struggle to most profoundly transform nature, transform society, and transform people's thinking. The task of this struggle is to promote our social life forward at a high speed, and move towards the most beautiful communist world that outstanding figures of all dynasties have dreamed of for thousands of years. To realize this arduous and magnificent task, it is impossible to achieve the goal without the high degree of enthusiasm and concerted efforts of the 600 million people, without the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the correct guidance of Marxist-Leninist thought – Mao Zedong Thought. The bourgeois individualistic, subjective idealist worldview is completely incompatible with the goals of the socialist cause, and any of its influences are extremely dangerous, will disintegrate our fighting will, dissolve our organization, and undermine our socialist cause; we cannot have the slightest idea of ​​reconciling with it. We need to stand firmly on the side of the worldview that is completely opposed to it. In our era, it is completely wrong to consider personal interests apart from the victory of the socialist cause and the interests of the broad masses of the people. Only the victory of the socialist cause is the real victory of each of us, and only the interests of the broad masses of the people are the fundamental interests of each of us. We must always make ourselves "have things in our eyes," "have people in our eyes," and "have the Party in our eyes," and also actively engage in work and labor with an attitude of "having no me in our eyes." That is to say, we must, through our own actions, resolutely establish a proletarian, communist, dialectical materialist and historical materialist worldview that can both correctly understand the world and actively change it.

    破资产阶级世界观　立无产阶级世界观
    艾思奇
    无产阶级世界观就是要正确地认识在我们周围实际存在着的、不断发展着的物质世界，并且要和广大人民群众站在一起，在党的领导之下积极地改变这个世界。
    在我们周围实际存在着的物质世界中，最重要的就是我们的社会主义事业的辉煌胜利，是1958年以来在我们社会主义建设工作中继续不断出现的大跃进，是随大跃进而产生的人民公社这一种崭新的社会组织形式。创造这些伟大成绩的力量和源泉是我国亿万人民群众的冲天干劲，领导人民群众实现这一切创造的先锋队伍是中国共产党，它的指导思想是党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，是创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的毛泽东思想。
    这些胜利是客观存在的事实，是客观规律的产物，我们的主观必须正确反映客观存在的事实，把握客观的规律，这是无产阶级的世界观——辩证唯物主义认识论的起码的要求。无产阶级的世界观尤其要求我们充分估计到人民群众的伟大创造力，充分认识到能够使人民群众的创造力最充分地发挥出来的马克思列宁主义党的伟大的领导作用，毛泽东思想的伟大的指导作用。无产阶级的世界观不但要求我们能够正确地认识客观存在的实际事物和客观规律，它更要求我们善于充分有效地发挥人的主观能动作用。使我们由一个辉煌的胜利走向另一个更辉煌的胜利。
    我们反对那些用资产阶级世界观观察客观世界的人，因为他们有眼而看不见我们周围确实地存在着的客观事物，他们忽视我国社会主义事业的辉煌胜利，抹煞大跃进和人民公社的伟大成就。这叫做“目中无物”。他们在群众运动面前惊惶失措，看不见人民群众创造历史的伟大作用，看不见党在这两年内领导中国人民以史无前例的高速度改变着中国社会的面貌，推动着中国社会前进，看不见党的社会主义建设总路线和毛泽东思想的正确性，这叫做“目中无人”，“目中无党”。“目中无物”“目中无人”和“目中无党”，一句话：心目中没有客观世界，主观意识不反映客观存在，这就是那些死抱着资产阶级世界观不放的人们的思想腐朽性的显著特征，是使他们堕落为主观唯心主义者的显著特征。
    他们所以陷入这样严重的错误，是由于他们从资产阶级个人主义的立场上来观察世界，不是按照毛泽东同志所指示的那样从客观存在的实际事物出发，从六亿人民群众出发，而是按照资产阶级一般所习惯的那样从个人打算出发。个人的物质利益或精神利益，个人的名誉，地位，物质报酬，生活享受，主观成见，教条公式等等，是他们据以搜集材料，评判事物的指针。哪怕是一种暂时的假象，由于个人利益的关系，他们可以把它宣扬夸大，当成永恒的客观真理，哪怕是确凿存在的客观事实，由于个人利益的关系，他们又可以把它完全加以抹煞。为什么他们不能正确认识周围存在的实际事物？因为个人的利益打算障碍了他们的主观认识，使它失去了反映客观的能力。为什么他们看不见社会主义事业的辉煌胜利，看不见人民群众的伟大创造？因为他们所注意的主要是个人的利益，“我”的利益。他们之所以会“目中无物”“目中无人”“目中无党”，是由于他们的眼目受到了“我”的利益的障蔽，是由于他们的眼目中仅仅只有一个“我”，这又叫做“目中有我”。“目中有我”，使他们看不见周围世界的真相，使他们所看见的世界只是“我”的世界，或以“我”为中心的世界，这也叫做“唯我论”。一切事物到他们的脑里都要经过他们那个“我”的透镜的过滤和曲折，因而事物本身的各方面真象就要被吸收、被拆散、被颠倒或被歪曲，而最后就只能剩下一些仅仅适合于“我”的脾胃的个别的、表面的感觉现象或假象。
  “我”就是他们的那种狭隘、片面和混乱的感觉经验的源泉，就是他们那种把局部看做全体、把假象看做本质、把暂时的东西看做永久的东西的，错误地评判问题的标准。这就是他们的“经验主义”。“经验主义”和“唯我论”，就是他们的主观唯心论世界观的不可分的特征。
    我们当前所面临着的社会主义事业，是规模空前地巨大的、最深刻地改造自然、改造社会和改造人的思想的斗争，这个斗争的任务是要以高速度推动我们的社会生活向前进步，向历代优秀人物梦想了几千年的最美妙的共产主义世界迈进。要实现这个艰巨而宏伟的任务，没有六亿人民的高度积极性和同心协力，没有中国共产党的坚强的领导和马克思列宁主义思想——毛泽东思想的正确指导，是不可能达到目的的。资产阶级个人主义的、主观唯心主义的世界观和社会主义事业的目的完全不能相容，它的任何影响都有极大的危险性，都会瓦解我们的斗志，涣散我们的组织，破坏我们的社会主义事业；我们对它不能有丝毫的调和的想法。我们需要确定不移地站在与它完全相反的世界观方面。在我们的这个时代，离开了社会主义事业的胜利和广大人民的利益来考虑个人的利益是完全错误的，只有社会主义事业的胜利才是我们每一个人真正的胜利，只有广大人民的利益才是我们每一个人的根本利益。我们一定要时时刻刻使自己做到“目中有物”、“目中有人”和“目中有党”，并且还要以“目中无我”的态度来积极地从事工作和劳动。这就是说，我们要通过自己的行动，坚决树立起既能正确认识世界，又能积极改变世界的无产阶级的、共产主义的、辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的世界观。
