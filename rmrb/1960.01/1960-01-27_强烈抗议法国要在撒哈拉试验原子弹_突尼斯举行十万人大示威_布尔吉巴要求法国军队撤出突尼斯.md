Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, January 25th: Tunisia today – on the opening day of the Second All-African People's Conference – held a mass rally of over 100,000 people to protest France's insistence on conducting nuclear tests in the Sahara.

	This protest rally was jointly initiated by Tunisia's ruling Neo Destour party, the Tunisian General Labour Union, the Farmers' Union, the Women's Union, the National Union of Students, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Artisans' Union.

	Representatives from various parts of Africa attending the Second All-African People's Conference, Tunisian President Bourguiba, and other senior Tunisian government officials also participated in the mass rally.

	The meeting was held in the colorfully decorated Government Square in the city center. National flags of various countries fluttered in the square, and people held flags and banners with slogans such as "Africa is for Africans," "We don't want a repeat of Hiroshima in Africa," "Africans Unite," and "Long Live Independence."

	President Bourguiba delivered a speech at the rally. He said that the Tunisian government and people strongly protest France's nuclear explosions in the Sahara. He said that the Sahara is not part of France, but part of Africa.

	He said that Africans do not want a repeat of Hiroshima in Africa. He demanded that the French government stop this criminal act against the African people.

	Bourguiba pointed out that France insists on conducting atomic bomb tests in the Sahara while still stationing troops on Tunisian territory. This situation shows that France has not abandoned its policy of aggression.

	In his speech, Bourguiba demanded the withdrawal of French troops from Tunisia. He said, "We will continue to insist on this demand until the last French soldier withdraws from Tunisia."

	After the meeting, the masses held a demonstration parade on the main streets. Thousands of people marched to the French Embassy and chanted slogans: "No interference in Africa," "Stop nuclear tests in the Sahara," "French troops withdraw from Tunisian territory," and "Down with French imperialists."

	Xinhua News Agency, Tunis: The Secretariat of the Tunisian Communist Party issued a communiqué saying that the Tunisian Communist Party was extremely angered upon learning of the French government's plan to conduct atomic bomb tests in the Sahara.

	The communiqué stated: "This plan runs counter to international efforts to ease the situation, disarm, and, above all, stop nuclear tests. If this plan is implemented, it will be a monstrous crime against the African people. The people of these countries unanimously protest France's nuclear test plan, believing that the Sahara is a part of Africa and that the French government has no right to use this place for heinous nuclear tests, regardless of Africa's safety and the future of African countries."

	The Secretariat of the Tunisian Communist Party expressed its support for the protests raised by the Tunisian government on this issue. The Tunisian Communist Party also called on its members to participate in actions against the French nuclear test plan.

    强烈抗议法国要在撒哈拉试验原子弹
    突尼斯举行十万人大示威
    布尔吉巴要求法国军队撤出突尼斯
    新华社突尼斯25日电　突尼斯在今天——第二届全非人民大会开幕的日子——举行了有十多万人参加的群众集会，抗议法国坚持要在撒哈拉进行核试验。
    这次抗议大会是由突尼斯执政党新宪政党以及突尼斯工会、农会、妇女联合会、全国学生联合会、商会和手工业者联合会等组织联合发起的。
    参加第二届全非人民大会的非洲各地代表、突尼斯总统布尔吉巴和突尼斯政府的其他高级官员也参加了群众大会。
    会议是在市中心的装饰得五色缤纷的政府广场举行的。广场上飘扬着各国国旗，人们拿着旗帜和标语牌，上面写着：“非洲是非洲人的”、“我们不要在非洲重演广岛事件”、“非洲人团结起来”、“独立万岁”。
    布尔吉巴总统在大会上发表演说。他说，突尼斯政府和人民强烈抗议法国在撒哈拉进行核爆炸。他说，撒哈拉不是法国的一部分，而是非洲的一部分。
    他说，非洲人不要在非洲重演广岛事件。他要求法国政府停止这种对非洲人的犯罪行为。
    布尔吉巴指出，法国坚持要在撒哈拉试验原子弹，同时仍在突尼斯领土上驻扎军队。这种情况表明，法国并没有放弃它的侵略政策。
    布尔吉巴在讲话中要求法国军队撤出突尼斯。他说，我们将一直坚持这个要求，直到最后一个法国兵撤出突尼斯为止。
    大会结束以后，群众在主要街道上举行了示威游行。数以千计的群众走到法国大使馆门前，并且高呼口号：“不准干涉非洲”、“停止在撒哈拉进行核试验”、“法国军队撤出突尼斯领土”、“打倒法国帝国主义者”。
    据新华社讯　突尼斯消息：突尼斯共产党书记处发表公报说，突尼斯共产党获悉法国政府将在撒哈拉进行原子弹爆炸试验的计划时感到无比愤怒。
    公报说：“这个计划是同国际上为缓和局势、裁军、首先是停止核试验所作的努力背道而驰的。如果这项计划付诸实施，那将是对非洲人民犯下弥天大罪。这些国家的人民一致抗议法国的核试验计划，他们认为撒哈拉是非洲的地方，并认为法国政府没有权利不顾非洲的安全和非洲国家的前途，利用这个地方来进行万恶的核试验。”
    突尼斯共产党书记处表示支持突尼斯政府就这个问题提出的抗议。突尼斯共产党并号召党员们参加反对法国核试验计划的行动。
