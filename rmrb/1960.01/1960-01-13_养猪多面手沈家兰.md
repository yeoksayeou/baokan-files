Shen Jialan (a member of the Communist Youth League) is a feeder at the stud farm of Fenjie Commune in Taixing County, Jiangsu Province. This young woman's pig-raising skills have spread throughout the county. She is not only a good feeder but also a good epidemic prevention worker and a good mating assistant.

		The First Female Mating Assistant

In the old society, people called those who raised breeding boars "sow pullers," saying that "only those with no future would do this job." Relatively wealthy families would not even consider marrying their daughters to the children of "sow pullers." After communization, communes and teams set up pig farms, and "sow pullers" became "mating assistants," with proper names and status, and no one looked down on this profession anymore. However, it was rare to see women working as mating assistants in Fenjie Commune.

Jialan, a girl who loved the pig-raising business, had been paying attention to the work of the mating assistants since she entered the farm the summer before last, gradually mastering the various characteristics of estrus in sows, and understanding mating techniques and experience. One day, one of the sows that Jialan and Wang Yuhui were jointly responsible for raising went into heat. They went to find the mating assistant, but he was out on business and would not return until the next day. Yuhui said, "Let's wait until tomorrow?" Jialan shook her head and said, "The sow will be past her estrus period tomorrow. If she doesn't mate this time, it will be more than twenty days before the next chance, and our plan for two and a half litters per sow per year will fail." After some discussion, they disregarded any shyness, and Jialan began to work like an experienced mating assistant, with Yuhui standing at the corner of the wall to "keep watch," afraid that someone would break in and laugh at them.

However, a few days later, the news that Jialan could mate pigs spread like wildfire throughout the farm and the commune. The young people, especially the female feeders, were happy for Jialan, but the old-fashioned people were secretly whispering, "Girls, what things couldn't you learn, but you learned how to mate pigs!" Jialan's father, who had originally disagreed with Jialan entering the pig farm, ran into the farm without asking questions when he heard the news and dragged Jialan home. Needless to say, he gave her a lecture and tried to persuade her. However, no amount of persuasion could convince Jialan, and she still insisted on raising pigs.

		The Pig Doctor Returns

The hygiene and epidemic prevention work at the stud farm is very well done, especially in the fourth row of pigsties managed by Shen Jialan and Yuan Yulan, which are cleaned inside and out.

It was in the late autumn and early winter of 1958 when the weather suddenly turned cold and hot, and many piglets on the farm started to suffer from white diarrhea. Within a few days, more than one hundred and twenty piglets in eighteen pens raised by Jialan and Yuhui were also infected. The piglets kept passing white excrement, and they refused to eat coarse or fine feed. They were so hungry and listless that they staggered when they walked, looking as if they would be blown over by a gust of wind.

White diarrhea is a deadly disease for piglets, and even the experienced veteran feeders on the farm were at a loss about what to do with so many sick piglets. Although Jialan had been on the farm for more than a year, it was the first time she had encountered white diarrhea in piglets, so needless to say, she had no idea what to do.

At this time, the commune organized an epidemic prevention training class, and the farm sent Jialan to study. Although it was only a short seven days, Jialan learned a lot of epidemic prevention knowledge. The comrades at the commune's epidemic prevention station explained clearly the origins, causes, and prevention methods of diseases such as swine erysipelas, swine fever, swine plague, and white diarrhea in piglets. During breaks, Jialan also humbly sought advice from experienced feeders from various brigades. She heard from the comrades in the commune that Chen Shouyi, a feeder from Liuqiao Brigade of Changzhou Commune, had become a feeder, an epidemic prevention worker, and a mating assistant due to his diligent study, and that he raised piglets very well. Jialan thought to herself, "I am also a member of the Communist Youth League. If others can do it, why can't I?"

As soon as the training class ended, Jialan rushed back to the stud farm overnight. The young feeders jumped for joy, "Now we have a solution, the pig doctor is back!" Jialan distributed the chlortetracycline manufactured by the county veterinary hospital that she had brought back to the pigsties with the most severe cases of white diarrhea. At the same time, based on the folk remedies she had learned from the old feeders, she and everyone else collected sweet potato vines, garlic sprouts, scallions, mint, etc., and made a total of four kinds of folk medicines for treating white diarrhea. These folk medicines played a significant role in treating white diarrhea in piglets.

The piglets refused to take medicine, so Jialan held them in her arms and fed them one bite at a time. Whether it was day or night, Jialan stayed by the sick pig pens like a nurse. In less than ten days, the white diarrhea in piglets on the farm was eradicated, and a large number of piglets were rescued from the brink of death.

Under Jialan's influence, the feeders all understood the importance of epidemic prevention work and began to study epidemic prevention knowledge and draw up hygiene and epidemic prevention covenants.

Now all pigsties are given a minor disinfection every three days, mainly by changing the dry soil and sprinkling lime in the pens; a major disinfection every seven days, washing the pig pens with grass ash; and a thorough disinfection every half month, replacing all the mud in the pens with dry soil, and disinfecting all utensils such as food bowls and spoons with lime water. In terms of feed, all feeds are refined, cold feed is changed to warm feed in winter, and hard pens are changed to semi-hard and semi-soft pens. Because the feeders all do epidemic prevention work, none of the more than nine hundred stud pigs and piglets raised on the farm are sick. The most serious diseases that endanger pig herds, such as swine fever, swine erysipelas, swine plague, and white diarrhea in piglets, have disappeared here.

		The Origin of the Little Straw Nest

Outside some of the recently farrowed sow pens, there is a straw nest, like a deep-mouthed basin placed upside down, with a bowl-sized hole on top. When you lift the lid with your hand, oh dear! Smooth piglets are lying inside, and the straw nest is warm.

The winter before last was unusually cold. At this time, a litter of sows gave birth. To keep the piglets from freezing, Jialan laid a layer of rice straw where the piglets slept. The piglets crawled into the rice straw one by one, and those that couldn't fit crawled into the sow's arms. At night, the temperature was even lower, and the piglets were so cold that they couldn't sleep, chirping and squeaking non-stop, and the sow couldn't sleep either. Jialan found a piece of torn sack and gently covered the piglets with it. However, the piglets had to nurse three or four times a night, and every time they moved, the sack would slip to the side. To take care of these piglets, she had to get up several times every night to cover the piglets with the sack.

One day, Jialan saw a child in a "standing nest," which sparked her inspiration. She returned excitedly and said to Yuhui, "Now we have a solution!" She made a straw nest herself, opened a small door next to it, placed it in the pen, and laid another layer of rice straw on the ground. When she caught the piglets in the nest, they were no longer frozen. However, the old sow couldn't see the piglets at once, so she kept poking around with her mouth, often overturning the straw nest. So they moved the straw nest outside the pen. In the evening, the piglets would crawl out of the pen and go to sleep in the straw nest. When it was time to nurse, they would run back to the pen. Later, to allow fresh air to enter the nest, they also opened a small vent on top of the straw nest, making this "small warm house" even more ideal. Because of Jialan's careful care, no piglets on the farm have been frozen or crushed to death for two winters.

		Bad Habits Can Also Be Changed

The feeders at the stud farm launched a red flag competition, which was evaluated once a month. Because the feeding management and hygiene and epidemic prevention work in the row of pigsties managed by Jialan were well done, the red flag was almost always in their pigsties. Last spring, the red flag was taken away by another pigsty once.

The thing is this: Because the pig farm was gradually expanding, a batch of fine breed sows were transferred in from the brigade. Among the few that Jialan was assigned, there happened to be two old sows that refused to run to the hard pen to urinate and defecate. They slept there and urinated there. Jialan had to clean it up for them every day and change the dry soil for them, but it was still not clean. After one night, the area under the pigs became a pool of water, and the dry soil became a muddy mess. The sows themselves were covered in mud, looking like mud monkeys, extremely unsightly. When it came time to evaluate the red flag, many people criticized them, saying that they did not meet the conditions for the red flag. An old feeder argued with everyone. He said, "I have been raising pigs for decades, and I have also encountered this kind of trash. It's in their nature, there's no way to fix it. This shouldn't be counted as a condition!"

Jialan frowned at the old sows' bad habit, wondering, "Is it really impossible to change what's in their nature?" Jialan is a thoughtful, meticulous, and clever girl, and this time, she still didn't lose her confidence. After discussing it with everyone, she realized that it was because the old sows were not used to the new dwelling. Jialan and Yuhui came up with a "symptomatic treatment" method. The two took turns guarding at night, driving the old sows to the hard pen every hour. After three or four consecutive nights, the old sows' bad habits were finally corrected, and the red flag was taken back by them.

    养猪多面手沈家兰
    本报记者  严锋明
    沈家兰（共青团员），是江苏泰兴县分界公社种猪场的饲养员。这位年青姑娘的养猪本领，已在全县传扬。她既是个好饲养员，又是个好防疫员、好配种员。
        第一个女配种员
    旧社会，人们把养种公猪的人叫做“拉骚猪”的，说什么“没出息的人才干这一行”。比较富裕的人家，没有一户肯和“拉骚猪”的儿女结亲家。公社化以后，社社队队都办起了养猪场，“拉骚猪”的变为“配种员”，言正名顺，再没有人轻视这一行了；但是妇女做配种员，在分界公社还很少见过。
    家兰，这位热爱养猪事业的姑娘，自从前年夏天进场起，就留心配种员的工作，逐渐地掌握了各种母猪发情的特征，了解配种技术和经验。有一天，家兰和王玉蕙共同负责饲养的母猪中有一只发情了。她们去找配种员，那知配种员出外有事，要到第二天才回来。玉蕙说：“明天再说吧？”家兰摇摇头，说：“母猪明天就过了发情期，这次配不上，错一交又是二十多天，我们订的母猪一年两胎半的计划就落空了。”两个人一商量，也顾不得怕羞，家兰就像一个老配种员似的工作起来，玉蕙站在墙角替她“把风”，生怕有人闯进来，笑话她们。
    可是，几天以后，家兰会配种的事情还是像一阵风似的传遍全场、全公社，青年们尤其是女饲养员们都为家兰高兴，老脑筋的人都在背地里一句半句议论：“姑娘丫头子，什么事情不好学，学配种！”家兰的父亲本来就不同意家兰进养猪场，听见这个消息，不问青红皂白就跑进场来，死拖活拖的把家兰拖回家去了。不用说，又是教训一顿，劝说一番。但是，千说万说，没有一条理由能说服家兰，家兰还是坚持要去养猪。
      猪医生回来了
    种猪场的卫生防疫工作做得很好，尤其是沈家兰和袁玉兰负责的第四排猪舍，里里外外打扫得干干净净。
    那是在1958年的秋末冬初，由于天气忽冷忽热，场里许多小猪生起白痢病来了。没几天，家兰和玉蕙饲养的十八个圈一百二十多只仔猪也给传染上了。小猪尽拉白屎，粗料细料都不吃，饿的没精打采，走起路来屁股直打晃，看样子一阵大风就会被刮倒似的。
    白痢病是小猪的死症，就连场里几个有经验的老饲养员也被这一大批小猪生病的情况弄得没法了。家兰虽然进场有一年多，但小猪白痢病还是第一次遇到，不用说，更是一点办法也没有。
    这时，公社里办了一个防疫训练班，场里派家兰去学习。虽然短短的七天时间，但家兰却学到了很多防疫知识。什么猪丹毒啦，猪肺疫啦，猪瘟病啦，还有小猪白痢病，这些病疫的来龙去脉，怎样防治，公社防疫站的同志讲得一清二楚。在休息时间，家兰还向各个大队来的、防疫有经验的饲养员们虚心请教。听公社的同志说，常周公社刘桥大队饲养员陈守益，由于刻苦钻研，现在既是饲养员，又是防疫员和配种员，猪仔养得很好。家兰心里想：“我也是共青团员，人家能做到的，我为什么不能做到！”
    训练班一结束，家兰就连夜赶回种猪场。年轻的饲养员们高兴得直跳：“这下有办法了，猪医生回来了！”家兰将带回来的本县兽医院仿制的合霉素，分给白痢病最严重的猪舍，同时，根据从老饲养员那里新学来的土药方，和大家一起收集蕃瓜藤、大蒜苗、胡葱、薄荷等，一共制成了四种治白痢病的土药。这些土药在治疗小猪白痢病中起了不小的作用。
    小猪不肯吃药，家兰就将它抱在怀里，一口一口的喂。无论是白天还是夜晚，家兰守在病猪栏边，像护士一样。不到十几天功夫，全场的小猪白痢病被扑灭了，大批小猪从死亡线上抢救了过来。
    在家兰的影响下，饲养员们都懂得了防疫工作的重要性，学习起防疫知识，订出了卫生防疫公约。
    现在所有猪舍每隔三天一次小消毒，主要是换干土，圈里撒石灰；每隔七天一次大消毒，把猪圈用草木灰洗刷一遍；每隔半月来一次彻底消毒，将圈泥全部换上干土，食缸、勺子等全部用具都用石灰水消毒。在饲料方面，全部做到粗料细喂，冬天将冷食改温食，硬圈改成半硬半软圈。由于饲养员都做防疫工作，全场饲养的九百多只种猪和苗猪，没有一只病猪。危害猪群最严重的猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫和小猪白痢病，在这里已经绝迹了。
      小草窝的来历
    在一些刚生产不久的母猪栏外面，摆着一只草窝子，就像一只底朝上的深口面盆，上面有一个碗口大的洞，用手将盖子一揭，哎唷！里面躺着光滑的猪仔，草窝里暖和和的。
    前年冬天，冷得出奇。这时，有一窝母猪生产了。为了使小猪不受冻，家兰给小猪睡的地方铺了一层稻草。小猪一只只钻到稻草里去，挤不下的就钻在母猪怀里。夜里，气温更低，小猪冻的睡不着，吱吱咕咕地闹不息，母猪被闹的也睡不成。家兰找来了一条破麻袋，轻轻地盖在小猪身上。可是，小猪一夜要吃三四遍奶，一活动，麻袋就滑在一旁。为了照顾这些小猪，她每夜要起来给小猪盖几次麻袋。
    一天，家兰看到了小孩“站窝”，触动了她的灵机。回来兴致冲冲地对玉蕙说：“这下子有办法了！”她自己动手把稻草编扎了一个草窝子，旁边开了一个小门，摆在圈里，地上又铺了一层稻草。把小猪捉在窝里，小猪再不受冻了。可是，老母猪一下看不到小猪，就到处用嘴拱呀拱的，草窝经常被它拱翻了。于是她们就将草窝搬到栏外，一到傍晚，小猪就从栏里钻出来，到草窝里睡觉。吃奶时，再跑到栏里去。后来为了使窝里有新鲜空气进去，又在草窝顶上开一个小出气洞，这个“小暖房”就更加理想了。因为家兰的精心照顾，两个冬天，场里都没有冻死或者压死一头小猪。
    坏习惯也能改过来
    种猪场的饲养员之间开展了红旗竞赛，每个月评一次。由于家兰负责的那排猪舍饲养管理、卫生防疫工作做得好，所以红旗差不多次次都在她们的猪舍里。去年春天，有一次红旗被别的猪舍夺去了。
    事情是这样的：因为猪场逐渐扩大，从大队里调进了一批良种母猪。家兰分到的几只中，偏偏有两只老母猪撒尿拉屎不肯跑到硬圈去，睡在那里，就尿在那里。家兰天天都要为它打扫，为它换干土，还是弄不干净，一夜过来，猪身底下就成了一个水汪塘，干土成了稀烂泥，母猪也混身滚的像只泥猴子，难看极了。评红旗的时候，许多人都提出了批评，说她们不够红旗条件。有个老饲养员跟大家争起来。他说：“我养了几十年的猪，也碰到这种贱货，这是天生的，没办法。这一条不能算条件！”
    家兰想到老母猪这个坏习惯，就发起了愁：“难道真是天生的不可改变的吗？”家兰是个肯动脑筋，心细又灵巧的姑娘，这一回，她仍没有失掉信心。跟大家一商量，才知道原来是老母猪换了新住处不习惯的缘故。家兰和玉蕙就来一个“对症下药”的办法，两个人轮流守夜，隔一个时辰就将老母猪赶到硬圈去。一连三四个通宵，终于，老母猪的坏习惯被改过来了，红旗又被她们夺回来了。
