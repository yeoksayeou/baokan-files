    Prime Minister Ne Win
    General Ne Win, Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, and Chief of Staff of the Union of Burma, was born on May 24, 1911, in Pyay Township, Burma. He received his early education in his hometown and later entered Rangoon University.
    In 1932, while working in the postal and telecommunications department, he joined the "We Burmese Party" (i.e., the Dobama Asiayone), and began his struggle for Burmese national independence. In 1942, under the leadership of Aung San, Ne Win organized the Burmese "Independence Army" in Thailand and led an advance brigade into Burma.
    During the Japanese occupation of Burma, Ne Win was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Army with the rank of Colonel. At that time, the Burmese people's hatred of the Japanese occupiers was growing. Ne Win, Aung San, and others secretly planned to resist Japan and expand their armed forces. On March 27, 1945, the anti-Japanese war broke out in Burma, and Ne Win was responsible for commanding operations against Japan in the Irrawaddy Delta region.
    After the end of the war, Britain re-ruled Burma. The original anti-Japanese armed forces were reduced and reorganized into regular troops. Ne Win continued to work in the army, first as a major battalion commander in the 4th Burmese Infantry Battalion, promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1945, promoted to colonel in 1947, and promoted to brigadier general in the same year.
    In 1948, the Union of Burma was established, and Ne Win was promoted to Major General. In 1949, he served as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of Burma, and was immediately promoted to Lieutenant General. In 1949, Ne Win joined the cabinet as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense and Home Affairs. In 1950, Ne Win resigned from his government posts and served exclusively as Supreme Commander; after the reorganization of the Burmese Defense Forces, he was reassigned as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces; in January 1956, he was promoted to General.
    In October 1958, the U Nu government resigned, and the parliament, on U Nu's recommendation, authorized Ne Win to form a caretaker cabinet. In February 1959, the Burmese Parliament passed a proposal to amend Article 116 of the Constitution, extending Ne Win's term as Prime Minister until the general election in 1960.
  In September 1955, General Ne Win led a Burmese military friendship delegation to visit our country.
