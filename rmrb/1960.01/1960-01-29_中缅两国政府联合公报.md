At the invitation of Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, General Ne Win, Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, paid a friendly visit to the People's Republic of China from January 24 to 29, 1960. Accompanying Prime Minister Ne Win were the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Burma, U Chan Tun Aung, and other high-ranking officials.

During Prime Minister Ne Win's visit to Beijing, he was received by Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Ne Win held unrestricted and frank discussions on matters of common concern to the two countries, particularly on issues concerning the consolidation and further development of friendly relations between China and Burma. Also participating in the talks were Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Marshal Chen Yi, Minister of Foreign Affairs U Chan Tun Aung, and other high-ranking officials from both countries. The talks were characterized by an extremely cordial spirit and full mutual understanding, and resulted in the signing of the "Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma" and the "Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Union of Burma on Boundary Issues" during Prime Minister Ne Win's visit to China. These two important documents will be simultaneously announced in Beijing and Rangoon upon Prime Minister Ne Win's return to Burma.

The two Prime Ministers noted with satisfaction the significant progress made in the friendly relations between China and Burma in recent years. This progress fully demonstrates the great vitality of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly initiated and firmly adhered to by the two countries. The two Prime Ministers are deeply convinced that the conclusion of the above-mentioned treaty and agreement will be a lasting symbol of the growing friendship and mutual understanding between new China and new Burma. The two Prime Ministers stated that the two governments will continue to strengthen friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries and continue to make joint contributions to promoting the solidarity of Asian and African countries and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.
