    Tung Nut Shelling Machine
    The Jishou General Machinery Factory in Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan Province, has successfully trial-produced a hand-cranked roller-type tung nut shelling machine made of iron and wood. It can shell 300 jin per hour, increasing work efficiency by more than 18 times compared to manual shelling. This machine has a simple structure, is easy to operate, and can be manufactured wherever there are blacksmiths and carpenters.
    Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture is one of the main tung oil producing areas in China. The year before last, the entire prefecture spent more than 1.25 million labor days shelling tung nuts. If all tung nut shelling machines were used for shelling, it would only take a maximum of 80,000 labor days to complete the task.

    桐子剥壳机
    湖南省湘西土家族苗族自治州吉首通用机械厂试制成功铁木结构的手摇滚轮式桐子剥壳机，每小时剥壳三百斤，比人工剥壳工效提高十八倍多。这种机器，构造简便，易于操作，有铁匠、木匠的地方都能制造。
    湘西土家族苗族自治州是我国桐油的主要产区之一，前年，全州为剥桐壳花费的劳动日就达一百二十五万多个。如果全部使用桐子剥壳机剥壳，最多只要八万个劳动日就可剥完。
