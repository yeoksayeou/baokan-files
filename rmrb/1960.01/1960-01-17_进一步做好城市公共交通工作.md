    Further Improve Urban Public Transportation
    Urban public transportation is the link organizing urban production and life. With the rapid development of national production and construction, urban public transportation has also achieved great development. In 1949, only twenty-six cities in the country had public transportation facilities, which has now grown to one hundred and nine; various public transportation vehicles have increased by 3.6 times, and a professional urban public transportation team of approximately 100,000 people has been established.
    However, with the rapid development of production, the sharp increase in the urban population, and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the development of urban public transportation still cannot keep up with the needs of production and life. The main problems currently existing in urban public transportation are too many passengers and too few vehicles. To solve this problem, on the one hand, it is necessary to focus on capital construction, and on the other hand, to continuously improve business management and fully tap the potential of existing equipment.
    Maximizing the potential of existing transportation tools and equipment is an important aspect of improving urban public transportation conditions at present. Facts have proved that the potential in this area is great. As long as the relevant enterprises, according to needs and possibilities, based on the size of the city, the volume of passenger flow, and economic, technical and other conditions, fully mobilize the masses, carry out labor competitions, and use existing tools and equipment to transport more passengers, it is entirely possible. In terms of business management, we should further improve operational efficiency, conduct passenger flow surveys, strengthen dispatching work, actively organize various transportation tools, increase transportation capacity, ensure safe driving, strengthen maintenance and repair, improve the utilization efficiency of vehicles and equipment, vigorously save fuel, electricity, and tires, widely promote alternative fuels, improve service attitude, and improve service quality, so that urban public transportation can better serve production and the people.
    Various localities have accumulated a lot of experience and created many new things in improving business management and capital construction. For example, Tianjin's trolleybuses use aluminum-iron overhead lines to overcome material difficulties; using iron sliding lines instead of copper sliding lines can save more than three tons of copper per kilometer, and investment in guide wires can be saved by about 50%. Harbin and Chongqing have adopted methods such as digging, repairing, piecing together, and substituting to repair a large number of vehicles, increasing the transportation capacity of public transportation. Shanghai has used alternative fuels such as natural gas, coal gas, and liquid hydrogen, saving a lot of gasoline. Beijing has focused on the three links of maintenance, repair, and driving, as well as the four aspects of technical systems, technical organization, technical supervision, and technical improvement, the degree of mechanization of maintenance operations for public buses has reached 99%, and for trolleybuses has reached 70%, maximizing the utilization efficiency of vehicles and equipment; the rate of good condition vehicles for public buses in most enterprises has increased from 70% in the past to more than 95% now; and downtime due to malfunctions has decreased from more than 1,000 seconds per 100 kilometers in the past to 20 to 30 seconds now. Seriously summarizing and promoting these experiences will play an important role in further improving urban transportation capacity.
    It is hoped that urban public transportation departments in various localities, under the leadership of the Party, will adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously launch mass movements, and launch a vigorous "five-good" socialist labor competition to improve operational efficiency, ensure safe driving, strengthen maintenance and repair, save fuel and raw materials, improve service attitude, and comprehensively improve service quality, and further improve urban public transportation work.

### 进一步做好城市公共交通工作

    进一步做好城市公共交通工作
    城市的公共交通事业，是组织城市生产和生活的纽带。随着国家生产建设的迅速发展，城市公共交通事业也获得了很大的发展。1949年全国有公共交通设施的城市只有二十六座，现在已发展到一百零九座；各种公共交通车辆增长了三点六倍，并且建立了一支约十万人的城市公共交通专业队伍。
    但是，随着生产的飞跃发展，城市人口的急剧增加和人民生活水平的不断提高，城市公共交通的发展仍然赶不上生产和生活的需要。当前城市公共交通中存在的主要问题是乘客多、车辆少。为了解决这个问题，一方面要抓紧基本建设，一方面要不断改善经营管理，充分挖掘现有设备的潜力。
    最大限度地发挥现有交通工具和设备的潜力，是当前改善城市公共交通状况的一个重要方面。事实证明，这方面的潜力是很大的，只要有关企业，根据需要与可能，按照城市规模的大小、乘客流量的高低，以及经济、技术等条件，充分发动群众，开展劳动竞赛，用现有的工具和设备，运送更多的乘客，是完全可能的。在经营管理方面，应该进一步提高运行效率，作好乘客流量的调查，加强调度工作；积极组织各种交通工具，增加运输能力；保证安全行车；加强保养修理，提高车辆和设备的使用效率；大力节约燃料、电力和轮胎，广泛推行代用燃料；改善服务态度，提高服务质量，使城市公共交通事业更好地为生产和人民服务。
    各地在改善经营管理和基本建设方面，已经积累了不少的经验，有不少的新创造。如天津市无轨电车采用铝铁架线，克服了材料困难；以铁滑走线代替铜滑走线，每公里可节约铜材三吨多，导线投资可节省50％左右。哈尔滨市和重庆市采取挖、修、拼、代等办法，修复大批车辆，增加了公共交通的运输能力。上海市采用天然气、煤气、液态氢等代用燃料，节省了大量的汽油。北京市抓住保养、修理、驾驶三个环节和技术制度，技术组织、技术监督、技术改进四个方面，保修作业机具化程度的公共汽车已达到99％，电车已达到70％，发挥了车辆和设备的使用效率；公共汽车完好车率大多数企业已从过去的70％提高到现在的95％以上；故障误时已从过去的每百公里一千多秒降低到现在的二、三十秒。认真总结推广这些经验，对进一步提高城市运输能力，将起重要的作用。
    希望各地城市公共交通部门，在党的领导下坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的提高运行效率，保证安全行车，加强保养修理，节约燃料原料，改善服务态度，全面提高服务质量的“五好”社会主义劳动竞赛，进一步做好城市公共交通工作。
