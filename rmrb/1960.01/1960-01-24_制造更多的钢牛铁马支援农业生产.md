    Make More Steel Oxen and Iron Horses to Support Agricultural Production
    Zhang Yanrong, Grinding Worker of the Nine Sisters Grinding Group, Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, National Advanced Producer
    The news of China's comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1959 made me so excited that I couldn't sleep. In that year, our agricultural machinery factory produced 900 combine harvesters and a large number of soybean harvesting devices and hay rakes, powerfully supporting agricultural production. This year, the output of agricultural machinery will increase significantly. The output of combine harvesters alone will increase by one-third compared to last year. The NB-T new diesel engine, which has just been trial-produced as a sample, will be trial-produced in small batches after appraisal. These diesel engines are fuel-efficient, lightweight, and suitable for rural use. The technical requirements for manufacturing them are relatively high. Our Nine Sisters Grinding Group are all young girls, and we don’t have much experience or high technical skills, so it's difficult to be responsible for processing the more precise parts of the diesel engine. However, we are determined to listen to the Party, study diligently, practice hard, consult with experienced master workers, and actively promote technological innovation to ensure that we maintain the glorious record of overfulfilling production tasks every month and producing no defective products. We will also take time to proactively help other workshops improve production and strive to build more and better steel oxen and iron horses to send to our farmer brothers.

    制造更多的钢牛铁马支援农业生产
    全国先进生产者北京农业机械厂九姐妹磨工组磨工  张艳荣
    1959年我国全面大跃进的消息，使我兴奋得睡不着觉。在这一年，我们农业机械厂生产了九百台联合收割机和大批大豆收割装置、集草车，有力地支援了农业生产。今年，农业机械产量将有大幅度的增长，仅联合收割机的产量就要比去年增加三分之一，刚刚试制出样品的NB—T新型柴油发动机，经鉴定后就要小批试制。这些柴油发动机省油、轻便，适合农村使用，制造起来技术要求比较高。我们九姐妹磨工组，都是年轻的姑娘，大家经验不多，技术不高，负责加工柴油机较精密的部件有很多困难。但是，我们坚决听党的话，勤学苦练，多请教老师傅，积极推广革新技术，保证保持月月超额完成生产任务，不出废品的光荣纪录；并且抽出时间，主动帮助其他车间提高生产，争取造出更多更好的钢牛铁马送给农民兄弟。
