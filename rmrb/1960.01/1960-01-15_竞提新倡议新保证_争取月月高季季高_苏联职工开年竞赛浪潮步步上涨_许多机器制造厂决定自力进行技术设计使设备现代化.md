Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 14th: Encouraged by the slogan "The second year of the Seven-Year Plan should surpass the first," the vast number of workers on the Soviet industrial production front have been working with even greater enthusiasm since the new year. In the past ten days or so, good news from production has been frequently reported in various industrial sectors, and new initiatives and guarantees from workers have continued to emerge, with the competition wave rising step by step.

In the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Combine, the largest iron and steel industrial enterprise in the Soviet Union, workers have been overfulfilling production plans every day since the beginning of the new year and have now produced more than 10,000 tons of steel above the plan. The open-hearth furnace workshop of the Red Sormovo Steel Plant in Gorky City set a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in seven hours and thirty minutes in the new year. The work shift led by Kozlukov overfulfilled the production plan by 110% in the first few days of the new year.

At the beginning of this year, workers in industrial enterprises across the Soviet Union made ambitious statements to make "each month surpass the previous month" and "the first quarter of this year surpass the fourth quarter of last year." They have set higher production plans than last year. In the steel industry, the steelworkers of an open-hearth furnace at the Zaporozhye Steel Plant produced more than 230,000 tons of steel last year, setting a world record. They decided to increase the steel output of this open-hearth furnace to 240,000 tons this year. The workers of the second open-hearth furnace workshop of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Combine decided that each worker should produce an average of ten tons of steel above the plan each month this year, and use the method of shortening the repair period of the open-hearth furnace to smelt fifty more furnaces of steel. The second open-hearth furnace workshop of the Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Combine decided that in addition to increasing steel production by 15,000 tons this year, they would also save 300,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and raw materials worth one million rubles. In the coal mining industry, the work shift led by the famous Donbass miner Mamai swore to strive to produce ten to fifteen tons of coal above the plan every day this year. In other industrial sectors, the production guarantees put forward by workers are also very encouraging.

In order to better realize this year's production plan, workers in industrial enterprises across the Soviet Union are finding ways, proposing initiatives, and enthusiastically launching production competitions. In the competition, the Mahot work shift of the Dnepropetrovsk Steel Plant in the Ukrainian Republic proposed establishing a steel fund above the plan, and their shift decided to invest 500 tons of steel in this fund. This initiative was supported by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine and was responded to by steel plants in the Ukrainian Republic. The famous New Kramatorsk Machine Building Plant proposed to carry out technical design with its own strength and produce more than 3,000 tons of machinery and equipment above the plan to modernize the existing machinery and equipment that the plant used to supply to other factories and enterprises. This extremely valuable initiative has been praised by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Stalingrad Tractor Plant proposed to produce 3,000 more tractors for agriculture this year. The workers of the Moscow "Dynamo" Factory proposed to produce 3,000 more motors for the countryside with their own strength this year. The "Communist Labor Shock Workers" of the Ilyich Mine in Lugansk Oblast initiated a proposal that each shock worker should help two workers greatly improve their production level so that they can also win the glorious title of "Communist Labor Shock Worker." Petericheva, a female worker at the Moscow Frunze Textile Factory, proposed at the beginning of the year that she should find ways to save money in every process this year to complete the annual plan of reducing production costs for individuals. This initiative has received a huge response in textile industrial enterprises across the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 13th: Many machine factories in the Soviet Union are beginning to promote the initiative of the New Kramatorsk Heavy Machine Plant in Ukraine. This initiative is to carry out technical design with one's own strength, modernize the existing machinery and equipment that the plant used to supply to other factories and enterprises, in order to rapidly increase output.

The initiative of the New Kramatorsk Heavy Machine Plant was recently proposed. After it was proposed, it was immediately approved by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that this initiative is of great significance in completing the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule and requires all regions to promote this initiative and strive to modernize the equipment of heavy industry, chemical industry, and power industry as quickly as possible. Subsequently, the Soviet State Committee on Automation and Machine Building specifically held a meeting with the participation of many heads of scientific institutions on the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The meeting pointed out that designers must participate in this work together with technicians, equipment modernization should first be carried out in departments that obtain the greatest economic benefits, and it must be carried out in an organized and planned manner.

In the initiative proposed by the workers of the New Kramatorsk Heavy Machine Plant, they pointed out that rapidly mobilizing forces to carry out the movement to modernize existing equipment can reduce investment, rapidly increase production capacity, and create great economic value for the national economy. They guarantee to produce more than 3,000 tons of equipment above the plan to help other factories and enterprises implement the modernization of existing equipment.

They are preparing to modernize the 1680-style sheet mill of the Zaporozhye Steel Plant this year, which will increase the annual output by 600,000 tons, increase the variety of products, and improve labor conditions. The factory workers decided to manufacture and supply the equipment needed to modernize this machine above the plan in the second quarter of this year.

The New Kramatorsk Machine Plant is also preparing to modernize the "1700" type sheet mill currently used by the Zhdanov Steel Plant. After the modernization of this machine, the steel rolling capacity can be increased by 1.5 million tons, which can save 130 million rubles compared to building a steel rolling mill with the same capacity.

Many other machine plants have also responded to the initiative of the New Kramatorsk Heavy Machine Plant. The Leningrad Hardware Factory held a meeting for this purpose and decided to modernize the turbine generators produced by the factory. There are currently 43 generators produced by this factory with a capacity of 100,000 kilowatts each used in power plants across the country. The factory decided to modernize all these generators with its own strength by the first quarter of next year. This can save 26 million rubles each year. In addition, the factory is also preparing to modernize the 50,000 kilowatt turbine generator produced by the factory.

The Dnepropetrovsk Hardware Equipment Factory has also decided to promote this initiative. The factory decided to modernize the lathes produced by the factory this year. This can increase productivity by 25%-30%.

    竞提新倡议新保证　争取月月高季季高
    苏联职工开年竞赛浪潮步步上涨
    许多机器制造厂决定自力进行技术设计使设备现代化
    新华社莫斯科14日电　在“七年计划第二年要赛过第一年”的口号鼓舞下，苏联工业生产战线上的广大职工在新年以来劳动热情更加充沛。十多天来，在各个工业部门中，生产捷报频频传来，职工的新倡议、新保证不断涌现，竞赛浪潮步步高涨。
    在苏联最大的钢铁工业企业——马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂，职工们在新年一开始就天天超额完成生产计划，现在已超计划生产了上万吨钢。高尔基城的红色索尔莫沃钢铁工厂平炉车间，在新年里创造了七时三十分钟炼一炉钢的新纪录。科兹卢科夫领导的工作班在新年头几天以110％超额完成了生产计划。
    今年一开始，苏联各地工业企业的职工就发出豪言壮语要使“每一个月都赛过头一个月”、“今年第一季度要赛过去年第四季度”。他们纷纷订出比去年更高的生产计划。在钢铁工业中，萨坡罗什炼钢厂的一座平炉的炼钢工人去年炼钢二十三万多吨，创造了世界最高纪录。他们决定今年要把这座平炉的出钢量提高到二十四万吨。马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂第二平炉车间的职工决定，要在今年内平均每个工人每月都要超计划生产十吨钢，并用缩短平炉修理期限的办法多炼五十炉钢。下塔吉尔钢铁联合工厂第二平炉车间决定今年除增产一万五千吨钢外，还要节约三十万度电和价值一百万卢布的原料。在采煤工业中，顿巴斯著名矿工马马伊所领导的工作班发出誓言，争取今年内全班每天都要超计划生产十吨到十五吨煤。在其他工业部门，职工们提出的生产保证，也令人十分鼓舞。
    为了更好地实现今年的生产计划，苏联各地工业企业的职工正在找窍门、提倡议，热烈展开生产竞赛。在竞赛中，乌克兰共和国第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克钢铁工厂马霍特工作班倡议建立超计划的钢铁基金，他们这一班决定要在这一基金内投入五百吨钢。这个倡议得到乌克兰共产党中央委员会的支持，并受到乌克兰共和国各钢铁工厂的响应。著名的新克拉马托尔斯克机器制造厂提出倡议，要用自己的力量进行技术设计，并超计划生产三千多吨机器设备，来使本厂过去供给其他工厂企业使用的现有机器设备现代化。这一极有价值的倡议得到了苏共中央的赞扬。斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂倡议今年要为农业多生产三千台拖拉机。莫斯科“狄纳莫”工厂职工倡议，今年要用自己的力量超计划为农村生产三千部电动机。卢干斯克州伊里奇矿井的“共产主义劳动突击手”们发起倡议，每个突击手要帮助两个工人大大提高生产水平，使他们也获得“共产主义劳动突击手”的光荣称号。莫斯科伏龙芝纺织工厂女工彼特雷切娃在年初提出，她今年要在每一工序中都找节约窍门，以完成全年的个人降低生产成本的计划。这一倡议在全国纺织工业企业中已经得到了巨大的响应。
    新华社莫斯科13日电　苏联许多机器工厂正开始推广乌克兰新克拉马托尔斯克重型机器厂的倡议。这个倡议是用自己的力量进行技术设计，将本厂过去供应给其他工厂企业使用的现有机器设备现代化，以达到迅速提高产量的目的。
    新克拉马托尔斯克重型机器厂的倡议是在最近提出的。提出后，马上得到苏联共产党中央委员会的赞同。苏共中央认为，这一倡议在提前完成七年计划方面有很大意义，要求各地推广这一倡议，争取最迅速地实现重工业、化学工业和动力工业设备的现代化。接着，苏联国家自动化和机器制造委员会专门就苏共中央的决定举行了有许多科学机关负责人参加的会议。会议指出，设计人员必须和技术人员共同参加这一工作，设备现代化应该首先在获得最大经济效果的部门进行，而且必须有组织有计划地进行。
    新克拉马托尔斯克重型机器厂职工们在自己提出的倡议书中指出，迅速动员力量开展使现有设备现代化的运动，就能够少花投资，迅速提高生产能力，给国民经济创造极大的经济价值。他们保证超计划生产三千多吨设备来帮助其他工厂企业实行现有设备现代化。
    他们准备在今年内将萨坡罗什炼钢厂的一六八○式薄板机现代化，这样就能使年产量提高六十万吨，还能增加产品品种，改进劳动条件。工厂职工决定今年第二季度超计划把这部机器现代化所需要的设备制好并供应这个工厂。
    新克拉马托尔斯克机器厂还准备将日丹诺夫钢铁厂现在用的“一七○○”型薄板机现代化。这部机器现代化之后，就能增加轧钢能力一百五十万吨，比新建同样能力的轧钢机要节约一亿三千万卢布。
    许多其他机器厂也响应了新克拉马托尔斯克重型机器厂的倡议。列宁格勒五金工厂为此召开了会议，决定将工厂所生产的透平发电机现代化。现在全国各地发电站使用这个工厂出产的发电机有四十三部，每部能力为十万瓩。工厂决定到明年第一季度止，将这些发电机全部用工厂自己的力量实现现代化。这样可每年节约二千六百万卢布。此外，工厂还准备将工厂生产的五万瓩的透平发电机也实现现代化。
    第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克五金装备工厂也决定推广这一倡议。工厂决定在今年内将工厂生产的车床现代化。这样就可以提高生产率25％—30％。
