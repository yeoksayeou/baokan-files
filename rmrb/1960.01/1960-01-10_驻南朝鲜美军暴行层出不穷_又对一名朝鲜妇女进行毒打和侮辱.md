    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th. According to a report from Seoul by the Korean Central News Agency today, American soldiers in South Korea brutally beat an innocent young South Korean woman on New Year's Day, stripped her naked, and painted her body yellow. In recent days, the Korean people have been incredibly indignant upon hearing about the barbaric act of U.S. troops shaving the heads of two South Korean women on January 2nd. This new atrocity has made all Korean people even angrier. They strongly demand that the perpetrators be severely punished and that the U.S. imperialists immediately get out of South Korea.
