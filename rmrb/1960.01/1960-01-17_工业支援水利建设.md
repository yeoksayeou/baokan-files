    Industrial Support for Water Conservancy Construction
    The above picture shows the wooden water pipes used at the Dushiping water lifting irrigation construction site.
    These wooden water pipes were manufactured by technical workers from the Gansu Provincial Electric Power Industry Bureau, Baiyin City Smelting Plant, Pharmaceutical Factory, Transportation Department, and other units to help Jingyuan County to replace iron water pipes. This is just one scene of Gansu's industry supporting water conservancy construction.
    Since last year, Gansu Province's industry has made tremendous contributions to supporting water conservancy construction. The machinery industry system took the lead, producing as many water conservancy tools as possible despite the insufficient supply of raw materials. The province's larger agricultural machinery factories have produced millions of water pipes, water pumps, iron shovels, steel drills, and other tools for water conservancy construction sites. The province's handicraft industry system used eight hundred tons of substandard steel allocated by the province to rush-produce iron picks, iron shovels, and crowbars day and night. Thirty-two machinery factories in Lanzhou, Baiyin, and Yumen organized more than 1,000 technical workers to form technical service teams, which went to water conservancy construction sites in various places to repair water conservancy tools and irrigation and drainage equipment. Employees of the Tianshui City machinery system have repeatedly organized tool repair teams, bringing their own tools and materials. Wherever the water conservancy army fights, they follow, and have already repaired 300,000 water conservancy tools. (Attached picture)

    工业支援水利建设
    左图是独石坪提水灌溉工地使用的木制水管。
    这些木制水管，是甘肃省电力工业局、白银市冶炼厂、药剂厂、运输处等单位的技术工人，帮助靖远县制造的，以它代替铁制水管。这只是甘肃工业支援水利建设的镜头之一。
    去年以来，甘肃全省工业在支援水利建设方面作出了巨大的贡献。机械工业系统一马当先，在原料供应不充裕的情况下，尽量多生产水利工具。全省较大的农业机械厂，已为水利工地生产了几百万件水管、水泵、铁锨、钢钎等工具。全省手工业系统用省上拨下的八百吨等外钢材，日夜赶制铁镐、铁锨和撬杠。兰州市、白银市和玉门市的三十二个机械厂，组织了一千多名技术职工参加的技术服务队，分赴各地水利工地，突击修配水利工具和排灌设备。天水市机械系统职工多次组织工具修配组，自带工具材料，水利大军战斗到那里，他们跟到那里，已经突击修配了三十万件水利工具。（附图片）
