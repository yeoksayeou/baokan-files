Xinglongxia Irrigation Area is a Model of Economical Water Use
Reduce Seepage, Adjust Crops, Perennial Irrigation, One Flow Rate Irrigates 200,000 Mu
Gansu Provincial Party Committee Calls on the Province to Launch a Campaign to Economize Water Use and Improve Irrigation Efficiency

This dispatch from our newspaper in Lanzhou on January 15th: The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to vigorously promote the advanced water use experience of the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area in Yuzhong County, where one cubic meter per second (i.e., flow rate) irrigates more than 200,000 mu of land. The Provincial Committee believes that promoting the experience of the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area is one of the effective measures to prevent and combat drought and ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture. Therefore, it calls on local Party committees, communes, production teams, and water conservancy departments to learn from the experience of economical water use in the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area while vigorously developing water conservancy, and to launch a campaign to reduce seepage and improve irrigation efficiency, striving to have a large number of new Xinglongxia-style irrigation areas emerge throughout the province in the first half of this year.

The main experiences of the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area in Yuzhong County in economizing water use and continuously improving irrigation efficiency are: carrying out canal renovation to reduce seepage along the way; changing large-scale flooding irrigation to small-plot irrigation; adjusting crop planting and implementing garden-style cultivation and planting in patches; strengthening irrigation management and implementing zoning irrigation and year-round irrigation; and establishing specialized teams according to the irrigation system, making overall arrangements, and rationally allocating irrigation water. This irrigation area uses an average flow rate of 0.24 cubic meters per second to irrigate 53,245 mu of land, most of which is irrigated more than three times. If calculated with a flow rate of one cubic meter per second, it can irrigate more than 200,000 mu of land, which is more than double the irrigation efficiency in many places. If this experience can be promoted throughout the province and achieve such a level of economical water use, then the actual irrigated area of the province can be increased by more than double.

Located at the foot of Xinglong Mountain, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area is a loess slope area with a thin topsoil layer and a gravel layer underneath. There is little rainfall, and it mainly relies on Xinglongxia water for irrigation. The maximum annual water volume of Xinglongxia is 0.35 cubic meters per second, the minimum dry season water volume is 0.09 cubic meters per second, and the average annual flow rate is 0.24 cubic meters per second. Before 1953, due to severe canal seepage, poor irrigation management, and unreasonable crop planting areas, it could only guarantee the water needs of more than 13,000 mu of cultivated land and one irrigation for more than 10,000 mu of land. After 1953, under the leadership of the Yuzhong County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the people of the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area renovated canals, reduced seepage, fully utilized all water sources, and implemented economical water use. The irrigated area increased rapidly, and in 1959, the irrigated area reached more than 53,200 mu, of which more than 33,000 mu were generally irrigated three times, and 9,000 mu were irrigated four times; at the same time, the floodwaters during the rainy season were used to increase the irrigation of more than 8,000 mu of autumn fields with seedling water. While ensuring the water use of crops in the entire irrigation area, it also helped the Jinya People's Commune irrigate more than 11,000 mu of land.

The fundamental reason for the continuous improvement of irrigation efficiency in the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area is that the Yuzhong County Committee of the Communist Party of China adheres to putting politics in command and has established the belief of "man can conquer nature" and "unlimited potential" among the local masses. Therefore, it can continuously reform irrigation management, farming systems, and other aspects according to regional characteristics, break old rules, establish new regulations, and maximize the benefits of the smallest flow rate. When the initial proposal to thoroughly renovate the Xinglongxia canals was put forward in 1953, the Yuzhong County Committee actively publicized to the masses that this was an important measure to overcome the threat of drought and led the masses to persist in construction under severe drought conditions. As a result, once the more than 13,000 meters of main and branch canals were lined with cement, the flow seepage immediately decreased from more than 50% to 1%, and the irrigated area increased from more than 20,000 mu to more than 43,000 mu. In advocating planting according to local conditions and canals and adjusting crop planting areas, the Yuzhong County Committee used the fact that Qingcheng area had achieved increased production with two crops a year to explain to the masses that "stubble" can be transformed, so that the area of autumn high-yield crops increased from 30% of the total cultivated area to 50%, and the winter wheat planting area was expanded to adapt to the characteristics of less water in summer and sufficient water in autumn. When implementing garden-style cultivation to further improve economical water use, the county party secretary summarized and promoted the experience of "long plowing and short irrigation, convenient for both plowing and irrigation" through the Dingjiazhuang experimental field, as well as the experience of increasing production with 47 cubic meters of water per mu, and promoted the widespread implementation of garden-style cultivation in the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area to improve irrigation efficiency.

After strengthening political and ideological leadership and fully mobilizing the masses, they also carried out "one rectification," "one adjustment," "two uses," and "two reforms" in irrigation management, carrying out a series of reforms from both engineering measures and field management, so that irrigation management and farming systems were closely coordinated and mutually promoted. As a result, water waste was reduced again and again, and irrigation efficiency increased again and again. "One rectification" is to use cement lining to renovate main and branch canals, and at the same time, the irrigation system of the entire irrigation area is uniformly planned and generally rectified, and the dilapidated and seeping branch canals and farm ditches are merged, so that the water delivery loss is reduced by 5%; at the same time, ditches and ridges are added to reorganize the capillary canal network to achieve "ridges and ditches" and eliminate flooding and cross-irrigation. "One adjustment" is to adjust the area of various crops according to the water volume in the four seasons, reduce the proportion of summer bean crops, increase the planting of autumn high-yield crops such as corn, and increase the winter wheat, which accounts for 16.2% of the cultivated area, so that the annual water use is basically balanced. "Two uses" are to use winter water in winter and spring and flood water in summer and autumn, using both clear and flood water, and not stopping all year round, trying to expand the irrigated area and increase the number of crop irrigations. From the winter of 1958 to the spring of 1959, 52,000 mu of land were irrigated in five months, and 14,000 mu were winter irrigated by breaking ice in the coldest time. Last year, during the flood season, more than 8,000 mu of land were irrigated by using 13 flood control dams to intercept floodwaters. "Two reforms" are to change large-furrow irrigation to small-furrow irrigation and change scattered crop planting to concentrated planting. Now, large plots of cultivated land of more than ten mu in the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area have all been transformed, and more than 70% have been added with a movable ridge every three to four minutes of land according to the garden-style standard, which is convenient for cultivation and saves water. At the same time, all similar crops are planted in plots according to the farm ditch as a unit, which also reduces the consumption of ditch water in the cross-ditch. After the establishment of the People's Commune, experienced and strong commune members with rich irrigation experience were transferred to form the Xinglongxia Irrigation Professional Team, which is responsible for the maintenance of canals and the implementation of economical water use plans throughout the year, which has also played an important role in improving irrigation efficiency.

    兴隆峡灌区是经济用水典范
    减少渗漏，调整作物，常年灌溉，一个流量浇地20万亩
    甘肃省委号召全省开展经济用水提高灌溉效率运动
    本报兰州15日电　中共甘肃省委决定大力推广榆中县兴隆峡灌区一个秒立方（即流量）灌溉二十多万亩地的先进用水经验。省委认为：推广兴隆峡灌区经验，是防旱抗旱保证农业丰收的有效措施之一。因此，号召各地党委、公社、生产队和水利部门在大兴水利的同时，学习兴隆峡灌区经济用水的经验，开展一个减少渗漏，提高灌溉效率的运动，争取全省在今年前半年能出现大批兴隆峡式的新灌区。
    榆中县兴隆峡灌区经济用水，不断提高灌溉效率，的主要经验是：进行渠道整修，减少沿途渗漏；改大块漫灌为小畦灌溉；调整作物种植，实行园田耕作，成片种植；加强灌溉管理，实行分区灌溉和长年灌溉；按灌溉系统建立专业队，统筹安排，合理调配灌溉用水。这个灌区以年平均零点二四秒公方的流量，灌溉了五万三千二百四十五亩土地，绝大部分都灌水三次以上。如以一个秒立方的水折算，就可灌溉二十多万亩地，比许多地方的灌溉效率增加一倍多。这个经验如果在全省推广，都能达到这样经济用水程度，那末，全省的实际灌溉面积就可以增加一倍以上。
    位于兴隆山下的兴隆峡灌区，是黄土坡形地带，表土层较薄，下接砂砾层，雨水较少，主要依靠兴隆峡水灌溉。兴隆峡每年最高水量为零点三五秒公方，最枯水量为零点零九秒公方，年平均流量为零点二四秒公方。1953年以前，由于渠道渗漏严重、灌溉管理不善、作物播种面积不尽合理等等原因，只能保证一万三千多亩耕地的需水和一万多亩地的一次灌水。1953年以后，兴隆峡灌区的人民在中共榆中县委的领导下，整修渠道、减少渗漏，充分利用一切水源，实行经济用水，灌溉面积迅速增加，1959年灌溉面积已达五万三千二百多亩，其中三万三千多亩普遍灌水三次，有九千亩浇灌了四水；同时利用雨季洪水，使八千多亩秋田增灌了一次苗水。在保证全灌区作物用水的同时，还帮助金崖人民公社灌溉了一万一千多亩土地。
    兴隆峡灌区灌溉效率不断提高的根本原因，是中共榆中县委坚持政治挂帅，在当地群众中树立了“人定胜天”、“潜力无穷”的信念。因此才能根据地区特点，从灌溉管理、耕作制度等各个方面不断进行改革，破陈规，立新章，使最小的流量发挥最大的效益。当1953年最初提出彻底整理兴隆峡渠道时，榆中县委就积极向广大群众宣传这是战胜干旱威胁的重要措施，领导群众在大旱的情况下坚持施工。结果，一万三千多米的干支渠道一经水泥衬砌，流量渗漏立刻由50％以上降低到1％，灌溉面积由二万多亩增加到四万三千多亩。在提倡因地制宜、因渠种植、调整作物播种面积方面，榆中县委又以青城地区连年两茬种植获得增产的事实，向群众说明“茬口”可以改造，使秋季高产作物的面积由占总耕地面的30％增加到50％，并且扩大了冬麦播种面积，适应了水量夏少秋足的特点。在实行耕作园田化，进一步做好经济用水的时候，县委书记又通过丁家庄试验田，总结和推广了“长耕短浇，耕灌两便”，以及每亩地用水四十七公方仍能增产的经验，推动兴隆峡灌区普遍实行园田化耕作，提高灌溉效率。
    在加强政治思想领导，充分发动了群众之后，他们又在灌溉管理中进行了“一整”、“一调”、“两用”、“两改”，从工程措施和田间管理两方面进行了一系列的改革，使灌溉管理与耕作制度紧密配合，相互促进。结果，水量浪费一减再减，灌溉效率一跃再跃。“一整”是使用水泥衬砌整修干渠、支渠的同时，对全灌区的灌溉系统经过统一规划，普遍整理，合并了破烂渗水的斗渠、农渠，使输水损失降低5％；同时增沟加埂，重新组织毛渠网，作到了“有埂有渠”，消灭了漫灌、串灌。“一调”是按照四季水量情况，调整了各类作物的面积，压缩了夏田豆类作物的比例，增种了玉米等秋季高产作物，并增加占耕地面积16．2％的冬麦，使常年用水基本平衡。“两用”是冬春利用冬水，夏秋利用洪水，清洪并用，常年不停，尽量扩大灌溉面积，增加作物灌水次数。1958年冬至1959年春五个月时间，就灌地五万二千多亩，在最为寒冷的时间里还采取破冰冬灌一万四千亩。去年洪水期间，利用十三条拦洪坝拦洪浇灌的土地即为八千多亩。“两改”是改大畦灌水为小畦灌水，改作物零散种植为成片种植。现在，兴隆峡灌区内十亩以上的大块耕地已经全部经过改造，70％以上都按照园田化标准，每三至四分地加隔一条活埂，既便于耕作，又节省用水。同时按农渠为单位，全部实行成片种植同类作物，又减少了渠水串沟的消耗。在人民公社成立以后，又抽调富有灌水经验的精壮社员，组成了兴隆峡灌溉专业队，常年负责渠道维护和经济用水计划的执行，对于提高灌溉效率也起了重要作用。
