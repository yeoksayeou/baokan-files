Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 31st -- In the snowy Karamay oil region, the temperature has dropped to over thirty degrees below zero. However, whether under the derricks, beside the oil wells, or on the snow-covered oil field construction sites, production and construction are still proceeding rhythmically.

　　In the open snowfields of the first production zone in the southeastern part of the oil field, drilling workers are operating the rapidly rotating turntables, drilling the last well of 1959; at the same time, more drilling workers are busy erecting new derricks. In the first quarter of 1960, a large number of oil wells are to be drilled here. Now, new and old derricks have formed rows from east to west and columns from north to south, forming a forest of derricks. On the construction site, bulldozers, tractors, and automobiles are roaring non-stop. Although people's eyebrows and hat brims are covered with white frost flowers, no trace of cold can be seen on their faces.

　　The Sun Yuting Youth Iron and Steel Drilling Team, which attended the National Congress of Heroes, is the center of attention here, and the goal of learning and catching up. Now, they are determined to create a high record of three thousand three hundred meters of winter drilling in the first month of the new year. When the last well they drilled in 1959 had only seventy meters left, they suddenly encountered a high-pressure water layer. Underground water gushed out from the wellhead, ice columns hung everywhere on the derrick, and the water droplets splashed on the workers instantly froze into ice flowers. However, the confidence of all the team members in winning a good start remained unshaken. While fighting day and night at the well site, they sent a team to install a new well, resolutely ensuring that the new well would start drilling on time at zero o'clock on the 1st.

    克拉玛依建设者冒雪夺油
    据新华社乌鲁木齐31日电　在白雪茫茫的克拉玛依油区，气温已经下降到零下三十多度。但是，不论在井架下、油井旁，或是在大雪复盖的油田建设工地上，生产建设依然在有节奏地进行着。
    在油田东南部第一生产区的空旷雪地上，钻井工人操纵着飞快旋转的转盘，在钻凿1959年最后一口井；而同时，更多的钻井工人已在忙着竖立新的井架。1960年第一季度，这里要钻成大批油井。现在，新旧井架已经东西成行，南北成列，形成了一片井架林。工地上、推土机、拖拉机、汽车往来不停地吼叫着。尽管人们的眉毛上、帽沿上结下白白的霜花，但在他们的脸上却看不到丝毫的寒意。
    曾出席全国群英会的孙玉亭青年钢铁钻井队，在这里是人们注目的中心，学习和追赶的目标。现在，他们又决心在新年第一个月创造三千三百米的冬季钻井高纪录。他们1959年钻凿的最后一口井只剩下七十米的时候，突然遇到高压水层。地下水从井口汹涌而出，井架上到处挂上了冰柱，喷溅在工人身上的水点顿时结成冰花。但是全队职工夺取开门红的信心没有丝毫动摇。他们一面日夜奋战井场，一面派出一个班安装新井，坚决保证新井在1日零点准时开钻。
