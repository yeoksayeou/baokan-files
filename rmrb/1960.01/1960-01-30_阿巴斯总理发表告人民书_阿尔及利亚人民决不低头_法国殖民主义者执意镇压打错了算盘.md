Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, 27th -- Prime Minister Abbas of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria issued an appeal to the Algerian people here tonight. In his appeal, Abbas said that the French government's intentions are very clear. It is determined to use the army to suppress the Algerian people. "However, the Algerian people will never yield. The French colonialists have miscalculated. A nation that sacrifices everything for freedom is a nation that will never surrender."

Speaking about the recent meeting of the Algerian National Revolution Committee in Tripoli, he said: "After this meeting, the unity of our revolution has been strengthened. Those who harbor illusions about our so-called divisions are deceiving themselves." He went on to say that the committee, estimating the long-term and brutal nature of the war, made important decisions. The committee has already considered in principle to appeal to brotherly and friendly countries to send volunteer soldiers.

Regarding the reorganization of the Algerian government, he said: "The reorganization of the government is to meet the needs of new tasks. Former ministers and current ministers are all fighters with the same national ideals, fighting for a common cause of justice."

He said that the Algerian National Revolution Committee unanimously adopted the Algerian Provisional Government's statement on September 28, 1959, regarding de Gaulle's plan to resolve the Algerian issue, and the statement of November 20th announcing the negotiating representatives for the implementation of self-determination conditions and guarantees. This shows that the exercise of the right to self-determination can immediately end the war. The committee has authorized the Algerian government to negotiate with the French government with full power. The only goal of the negotiations is the method and guarantee for the implementation of the right to self-determination and the conditions for a ceasefire.

    阿巴斯总理发表告人民书
    阿尔及利亚人民决不低头
    法国殖民主义者执意镇压打错了算盘
    据新华社突尼斯27日电　今晚这里发表了阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯告阿尔及利亚人民书。阿巴斯在告人民书中说，法国政府的企图是十分清楚的。它执意要用军队把阿尔及利亚人民镇压下去。“然而，阿尔及利亚人民是永远不会低头的。法国殖民主义者打错了算盘。不惜为自由而牺牲的民族，是决不投降的民族。”
    他在谈到阿尔及利亚全国革命委员会最近在的黎波里举行的会议时说：“这次会议之后，我们的革命团结加强了。那些在我们的所谓分歧上抱着幻想的人，是在自欺欺人”。他接着说，委员会估计到战争的长期性和残酷性，作出了重要的决定。委员会已经在原则上考虑到要向兄弟国家和友好国家呼吁派遣志愿军。
    关于阿尔及利亚政府的改组，他说：“改组政府，是为了适应新任务的需要。前任部长和现任部长，都是抱着同一个民族理想、为共同的正义事业而战的战士”。
    他说，阿尔及利亚全国革命委员会一致通过了阿尔及利亚临时政府在1959年9月28日就戴高乐宣布解决阿尔及利亚问题的计划而发表的声明和11月20日为实施自决条件和保证而宣布谈判代表的声明。这表明：实施自决权，就可以立即结束战争。委员会已经授予阿尔及利亚政府以全权来着手同法国政府进行谈判。谈判的仅有目标是实行自决权的方式和保证以及停火的条件。
