	Rising Step by Step
	Jin Zhuang

	The spring spirit in people's minds is strong, and the spring in terms of seasons is also about to arrive. I remember in the past, during the Spring Festival, people often wrote a couplet like this—"A day of abundant resources and natural treasures, a time of outstanding people and spiritual land"—and pasted it on the gate. However, this good day, this auspicious time, which we eagerly hoped for, has only been felt and has only gotten better and better in the ten years since the founding of the country, under the leadership of the Party.

	Isn't this so? The press communique on the state of the national economy in 1959 tells us that the Second Five-Year Plan was completed three years ahead of schedule. This is truly a "day of natural treasures," a "time of spiritual land," with "abundant resources" shining in all directions. The achievements of the continued Great Leap Forward in our national economy are like the sun and moon illuminating the sky, bright and glorious. These great achievements are created by "outstanding people," created by the people of "six hundred million Shenzhou all becoming Shuns and Yaos."

	Our Party uses socialist and communist ideology to educate the masses of people and also fully develops scientific, educational, and cultural undertakings to cultivate the "outstanding people" of the era and create various talents needed for socialist construction. Just looking at the aspect of school education! In 1959, the number of full-time college students reached 810,000, the number of students in various secondary schools reached 12.9 million, and the number of primary school students reached 90 million. Look, the number of students studying in full-time schools alone exceeds 100 million, accounting for one-sixth of our country's population. What a huge number this is! We can recall that when the country was first liberated, in 1949, there were only 117,000 college students, 1.26 million secondary school students, and 24.39 million primary school students, a total of just over 20 million. After liberation, the number of our students increased year by year. And in 1958 and 1959, there was an even more rapid leap forward. However, this is only in terms of full-time schools, and does not include the students in cultural schools conducting literacy campaigns, nor does it include the students studying in various levels of spare-time schools. Among them, the number of students in secondary and higher-level spare-time schools alone reached 10 million. If we add them all up, the number will be even greater. As the saying goes, "Looking back when climbing the stairs, one realizes that one has been rising step by step." Isn't the situation of school education in our country like this?

	Our schools at all levels and of all types have cultivated tens of thousands of talents. They, like the broad masses of working people, have become the "outstanding people" of the era. The fact that such great achievements can be made in cultural and educational undertakings is the result of implementing the "walking on two legs" approach to running schools. The state runs schools, and the masses also run schools; both full-time schools and half-day and spare-time schools are run. If we have already reached a high level, it is precisely because of walking on two legs. Isn't this a very obvious thing? Six hundred million people demand that they become the "outstanding people" of the era. "Walking on two legs" to run schools and cultivate the talents needed by the country is a reflection of the demands of the masses. Under the nurturing sunshine of the Party's educational policy, this demand is like a spring bud emerging, breaking through the soil and splitting the rock, and no one can stop it. Some people look down on schools run by the masses, look down on half-day schools, look down on spare-time schools, and only want to use "walking on one leg" to run schools. However, the educational undertaking of "walking on two legs" has already sped past them, only leaving them surprised that they have fallen behind the development of the situation.

	Our socialist construction has a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, and the "walking on two legs" policy in education is one aspect of it. Because our educational undertaking is to serve proletarian politics and to serve socialist construction. One cannot "walk on two legs" while the other "walks on one leg"; one must keep up with the pace and be in sync with the rhythm. Good coordination leads to faster progress; poor coordination leads to pulling one's leg. Our start has been very good, and we will definitely do well step by step. Only by doing this can we create a situation of "abundant resources and natural treasures," "outstanding people and spiritual land." "Climbing a high mountain reveals even higher mountains; emerging from the vast sea reveals even vaster seas." Our national economy must continue to leap forward, with red arrows pointing to new targets in industry, agriculture, transportation, and so on. Then, the needed talents are all kinds of talents! We need more tractor drivers, we need more agricultural technicians, we need more motor operators, we need more cutting-edge scientific and technical personnel… These talents, under the guidance of the "walking on two legs" approach to running schools and under the cultivation of schools at all levels and of all types, will grow up in greater numbers.

	Today's situation is infinitely good, and the scenery of the future will be even more pleasant. Let us continue to "walk on two legs" on this cornerstone, stride forward, rise step by step, and climb to the peaks of culture, science, and technology.

    步步升高
    金庄
    人们思想上的春意正浓，而时令上的春天也将姗姗而来。记得从前春节，人们常常写着这样一副春联——“物华天宝日，人杰地灵时”，贴在大门上。可是，这个心头殷切盼望的好日子，好时辰，却只有在建国十年来，在党的领导下，才感受到，才愈过愈好。
    不正是这样吗？1959年国民经济发展情况的新闻公报告诉我们，第二个五年计划提前三年胜利完成了。这正是“天宝日”，“地灵时”，“物华”四射。我国国民经济的继续大跃进的成就，犹如日月丽天，皓皓煌煌。这些伟大成就，是由“人杰”来创造的，是由“六亿神州尽舜尧”的人们来创造的。
    我们党用社会主义和共产主义思想来教育人民群众，还充分发展科学教育文化事业，来培养时代的“人杰”，造就社会主义建设需要的各种人材。仅从学校教育这方面来看吧！1959年，全日制高等学校在校学生达到八十一万人，各类中等学校学生达到一千二百九十万人，小学学生达到九千万人。请看，只在全日制学校学习的学生就有一亿人以上，占我国人口的六分之一。这是多么巨大的一个数字啊！我们可以回想一下，在全国刚解放的时候，1949年高等学校学生只有十一万七千人，中等学校学生只有一百二十六万人，小学生只有二千四百三十九万人，一共才有二千多万人。解放以后，我们的学生一年年增多。而到1958、1959年，更来了一个飞速的跃进。但是，这仅仅是从全日制学校来讲的，还没有包括进行扫除文盲的文化学校的学员，也没有包括在各级业余学校学习的学员。其中仅中等和中等以上的业余学校的学员就达一千万人。如果全部算上，数字将更多了。俗话说：“上得楼梯回头看，方知原已步步高。”我国学校教育的情况，不正是这样的吗？
    我们各级各类的学校，培养出成千上万的人材。他们同广大劳动人民一样，成为时代的“人杰”。文化教育事业方面，能够取得这么大的成绩，正是执行了“两条腿走路”的办学方针的结果。国家办学，群众也办学，既办全日制学校，也办半日制和业余学校。如果说，我们已经登高了的话，那也正是由于两条腿走路。这不是很明显的事情吗？六亿人民要求自己成为时代的“人杰”。“两条腿走路”办学校，培养国家所需要的人材，就是群众的要求的反映。这种要求在党的教育方针的阳光抚育下，犹如春芽展放，破土裂石而出，谁也阻挡不了。有人看不起群众办的学校，看不起半日制学校，看不起业余学校，只想用“一条腿走路”来办学校。但是，“两条腿走路”的教育事业，已在他们面前飞奔而过，只让他们惊讶自己已落后于形势的发展罢了。
    我国社会主义建设有一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，而教育事业上的“两条腿走路”的方针，正是它的一个方面。因为我们的教育事业是要为无产阶级政治服务的，是要为社会主义建设服务的。不能一个用“两条腿走路”，而另一个用一条腿走路，必须跟得上步子，合得上拍子。配合得好，走得更快，配合得不好，就会扯腿。我们的起步已经很好，一定会做到步步好。只有这样做，我们也才能创造出“物华天宝”、“人杰地灵”的局面。“登高山更有高山，出瀛海复有瀛海”。我们的国民经济要继续跃进，红色的箭头射向工业、农业、交通运输等的新的指标。那末，需要的人材，就是各式各样的人材！我们需要更多的拖拉机手，我们需要更多的农业技术员，我们需要更多的电动机手，我们需要更多的尖端科学技术员……这些人材，在“两条腿走路”的办学方针指导下，在各级各类的学校的培养下，将会更多地成长起来。
    今天形势无限好，来日风光更宜人。让我们在这个基石上，继续用“两条腿走路”，大踏步向前，步步升高，登上文化科学技术的高峰。
