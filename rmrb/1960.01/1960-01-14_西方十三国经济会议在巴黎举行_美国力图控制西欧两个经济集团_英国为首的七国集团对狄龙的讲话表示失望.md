Xinhua News Agency, London—The Western thirteen-nation ministerial-level economic conference was held in Paris on the 12th.

This conference was proposed by the United States at the highest-level Western meeting following U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon's visit to Western Europe last December. Participants included five countries from the British-led Western European "Free Trade Association" Group of Seven, five countries from the West German and French-led Western European "Common Market" Group of Six, as well as the United States, Canada, and Greece.

The conference will discuss the relationship between the two opposing economic groups in Western Europe and their relationship with the United States, as well as the joint Western "aid" to underdeveloped countries.

A noteworthy aspect of this conference is the U.S.'s eagerness to control Western European economic relations due to its declining economic position in the capitalist world.

Sources reveal that the United States intends to propose at this conference the establishment of a Western "Economic Consultation Council" led by the U.S. to replace the "European Economic Cooperation Agency," which is currently under British influence, in order to control Western European trade relations according to its own interests and avoid being "discriminated against" by the two hostile Western European economic groups. At the same time, due to the increasingly deteriorating international payment situation in the United States, it also plans to ask Western European countries to provide more funds to establish an agency under U.S. control to provide "aid" to underdeveloped countries.

U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon, who made an exploratory visit to Western Europe last December without success, led the U.S. delegation to the meeting. At the meeting on the 12th, he said that "the trade problems currently emerging in Western Europe pose some dangers," and that these problems "could cause political and economic friction within Europe (referring to Western Europe), thereby potentially weakening the unity of the free world (referring to Western countries)." On the other hand, he expressed fear that the "Group of Six" and "Group of Seven" "may take measures that seriously undermine the world trade principles established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade" in seeking to resolve regional issues. This means that the United States is both afraid that the two groups will be too opposed, causing internal divisions within the Western camp, and that they will unite to squeeze out the United States' position in the Western European market. When talking about the issue of "aid" to underdeveloped countries, he emphasized that Western European countries must "play an increasingly important role" in providing so-called "development assistance" and "cooperate" with the United States. That is to say, it requires Western European countries to provide more money under U.S. control to serve the U.S. plan for underdeveloped countries. Dillon also pointed out that the above-mentioned problems he raised "cannot be successfully resolved through existing institutions." Therefore, it is necessary to "improve international economic cooperation organizations."

Dillon put forward three specific suggestions in this regard: First, he requested the establishment of an organization to "inherit" the existing "European Economic Cooperation Agency" composed of eighteen Western European countries, so that the United States could participate in a "formal and equal capacity" (note: the United States only has "observer" status in the "European Economic Cooperation Agency"). He specifically suggested that a three-person committee composed of one representative from each of the two Western European groups and one representative from "other" countries be formed to prepare for the establishment of this organization. Second, prior to the establishment of the aforementioned organization, a "small group" composed of a limited number of countries should be established. These countries should be those that are "able to make effective, long-term, and bilateral contributions in providing funds to less developed countries." Third, he suggested that the thirteen-nation economic conference itself continue to meet to discuss trade relations between Western European countries. After Dillon's proposal was put forward, the "Group of Six" and the "Group of Seven" held separate meetings to study their attitudes towards this proposal. A spokesman for the "Common Market" group stated after the meeting that they agreed with the idea of reorganizing the "European Economic Cooperation Agency." However, according to Agence France-Presse, people from the British-led "Free Trade Association" Group of Seven expressed "disappointment" with Dillon's speech because the speech did not put the so-called "necessity of consultation between the Six and the Seven" in the first place. Everyone knows that British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cohen-Heath-Emery publicly stated when he came to Paris to attend the meeting that making the "Group of Six" agree to negotiate some kind of union between the two groups was Britain's main goal. The London "Times" published a commentary on the 12th saying that the "expanded European Economic Cooperation Agency" proposed by the United States to include countries such as the United States and Canada "will become too large and lack regional characteristics."

The thirteen-nation conference continued on the 13th.

    西方十三国经济会议在巴黎举行
    美国力图控制西欧两个经济集团
    英国为首的七国集团对狄龙的讲话表示失望
    据新华社伦敦电　西方十三国部长级经济会议12日在巴黎举行。
    这次会议是美国副国务卿狄龙去年12月访问西欧以后，美国随后在西方最高级会议上倡议召开的，参加这次会议的有以英国为首的西欧“自由贸易联盟”七国集团中的五国，以西德、法国为首的西欧“共同市场”六国集团中的五国以及美国、加拿大和希腊三国。
    在这次会议上，将要讨论西欧两个对立的经济集团之间以及它们同美国之间的关系和西方国家共同“援助”不发达国家等问题。
    这次会议中引人注意的一点是美国由于它的经济地位在资本主义世界中不断下降而急于控制西欧经济关系的心情。
    有消息透露，美国打算在这次会议上建议成立一个由美国在起领导作用的西方“经济协商理事会”来代替目前处于英国影响之下的
  “欧洲经济合作局”，以便按照它自己的利益来控制西欧的贸易关系，而避免遭到两个敌对的西欧经济集团的“歧视”。同时，在这次会议上，美国由于本国的国际支付状况日益恶化，还打算要求西欧国家拿出更多的资金，成立一个在美国支配下的对不发达国家进行“援助”的机构。
    去年12月到西欧进行了试探性访问而没有成功的美国副国务卿狄龙，率领美国代表团出席会议，他在12日的会议上说，“目前在西欧出现的贸易问题造成了一些危险”，这些问题“能够在欧洲（指西欧）内部引起政治上和经济上的摩擦，从而可能削弱自由世界（指西方国家）的团结”。另一方面，他又表示害怕“六国”、“七国”两个集团“在谋求解决区域性问题时，可能采取严重损害关税及贸易总协定所确定的世界性贸易原则的措施”。这就是说，美国既害怕这两个集团对立得太厉害引起西方阵营内部的四分五裂，又害怕他们联合起来排挤美国在西欧市场上的地位。在谈到“援助”不发达国家的问题时，他强调西欧国家在提供所谓“开发援助”方面必须“起愈来愈大的作用”，并且同美国“进行合作”。这就是说，要求西欧国家在美国支配下拿出更多的钱来为美国对不发达国家的计划服务。狄龙还指出，他所提出的上述问题“都不能通过现有的机构获得成功的解决”，因此，有必要“改进国际经济合作组织”。
    狄龙在这方面提出了三项具体建议：第一，要求成立一个组织来“继承”现有的由十八个西欧国家组成的“欧洲经济合作局”，使美国能以“正式和平等的身份”参加（按：美国在“欧洲经济合作局”中只有“观察员”的身份），并且具体建议由西欧两个集团的代表各一人和“其他”国家的代表一人组成一个三人委员会来筹备建立这个组织。第二，在上述组织成立以前，建立一个由数目有限的国家组成的“小组”，这些国家应是那些“能够在向不那么发达的国家提供资金方面作出有效的、长期的、双边的贡献”的国家。第三，建议由这个十三国经济会议本身继续举行会议来讨论西欧国家之间的贸易关系问题。在狄龙的建议提出以后，“六国”集团和“七国”集团又分别举行了会议来研究它们对这项建议的态度。“共同市场”集团发言人在会后表示赞成改组“欧洲经济合作局”的意见。但是，据法新社报道，以英国为首的“自由贸易联盟”七国集团的人士却对狄龙的讲话表示感到“失望”，因为这个讲话没有把所谓“六国和七国进行协商的必要性”放在第一位。大家知道，英国财政大臣寇恩希特—埃默里来到巴黎参加会议时曾公开表明，使“六国”集团同意协商两个集团之间的某种联合正是英国的主要目的。伦敦“泰晤士报”在12日发表评论说，美国建议成立的让美国、加拿大等国参加进去的“扩大后的欧洲经济合作局将变得太庞大了，它缺乏区域特点”。
    十三国会议在13日继续举行。
