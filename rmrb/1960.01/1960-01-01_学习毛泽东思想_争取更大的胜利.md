**Summarize the Experiences of Revolution and Construction**

Based on the experiences of the past ten years, especially the Great Leap Forward of the past two years, the most fundamental way to complete the construction tasks in a faster, better, and more economical way is to be good at mastering and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

The correctness of Mao Zedong Thought has been tested by a long history and by the revolutionary struggles of all ethnic groups in China. Revolutionary practice is the touchstone of revolutionary theory. The correctness of Mao Zedong Thought has been confirmed not only by the two revolutionary stages of the Chinese democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and the three general lines formulated by the Party in these two stages for the democratic revolution, the socialist revolution, and socialist construction, but also by the victorious solution of the national question in China and by the correct path of construction in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

An important feature of Mao Zedong Thought is the combination of the universal truth of Marxism and the practice of the Chinese revolution, that is, solving the problems of the Chinese revolution and construction based on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and proceeding from the actual situation in China, and constantly enriching and developing Marxism-Leninism in the continuous revolutionary practice.

In any revolutionary stage, Comrade Mao Zedong conducted Marxist-Leninist class analysis of the actual situation and political situation in China, pointed out the main contradictions in various periods, and put forward a series of basic policies to solve these contradictions. Comrade Mao Zedong never forgot for a minute in the democratic revolution that we still had to carry out the socialist revolution. In the socialist revolution, he never forgot for a minute that we had to carry the socialist revolution through to the end and transition to communism. Therefore, he always paid attention to establishing and consolidating the leadership of the proletariat, constantly struggled against various non-Marxist ideas, implemented the extremely firm class policy of the proletariat, and combined the Marxist-Leninist theory of continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages according to China's conditions, guiding the Chinese revolution from one victory to another.

The construction achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also prove that Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth. The policy of regional autonomy is a Marxist-Leninist policy for correctly solving the national question. On the national question, the Party has opposed both Han chauvinism and local nationalism; it has not only established new relations of unity and friendship among all ethnic groups politically, but also gradually eliminated the de facto inequality among ethnic groups in economic and cultural construction. Carrying out construction according to Mao Zedong Thought and in combination with the actual situation in Inner Mongolia is the fundamental factor for the great achievements in the construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Therefore, in the past twelve years, what has been done correctly according to Mao Zedong Thought and what has been done wrong not according to Mao Zedong Thought needs to be seriously studied. This is the primary task of theoretical workers in our region.

Theory serves politics. Marxist-Leninist theory serves proletarian politics. At present, our theoretical work must be combined with the publicity of the general line, and must be combined with deepening the socialist revolution and accelerating the progress of socialist construction. To this end, we should, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's guiding ideology and working methods, combine the systematic study of Mao Zedong Thought with the extensive publicity of Mao Zedong Thought, combine popularization with improvement, vigorously cultivate thousands of theoretical cadres on all fronts of the Autonomous Region, and summarize our revolutionary and construction experiences in combination with the actual situation of the Autonomous Region. Only in this way can we have a great leap forward in theoretical work.

**The Great Significance of Studying Mao Zedong's Works**

It is a matter of great significance to conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's works and arm ourselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. What should be mainly studied when studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works?

First of all, we must study Comrade Mao Zedong's firm and unswerving proletarian revolutionary stand. We should study how Comrade Mao Zedong has always maintained a high degree of revolutionary optimism and indomitable perseverance in the face of difficulties in the revolutionary cause. For example, when the first domestic revolutionary war failed in 1927 and the national revolution was at a low ebb, Comrade Mao Zedong criticized the pessimistic ideas and arguments about the revolutionary cause, pointing out that the high tide of the revolution was inevitable and would come soon. When the Red Army went north on the Long March and the revolutionary forces were greatly weakened, and some people spread defeatist arguments, Comrade Mao Zedong criticized this defeatist argument, pointing out the victory of the Long March and its great significance. When Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of US imperialism, launched an anti-people civil war in 1946, and the reactionary army had a significant advantage in both quantity and equipment, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "What we rely on is nothing more than millet plus rifles, but history will eventually prove that this millet plus rifles is stronger than Chiang Kai-shek's airplanes plus tanks... The reactionaries will one day fail, and we will one day win." After the victory of the democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong again criticized the view that China's economy was backward and therefore pessimistic about economic recovery, pointing out that "the speed of China's economic construction will not be very slow but may be quite fast, and China's prosperity can be achieved in the near future." At every important juncture of the revolutionary struggle, Comrade Mao Zedong always pointed out that the revolutionary cause would surely win based on the science of Marxism-Leninism, guiding the people of the whole country to move forward courageously.

We should learn how Comrade Mao Zedong applied the scientific method of Marxism-Leninism extremely profoundly when examining and analyzing problems. Comrade Mao Zedong used the method of class analysis to solve a series of major problems in the revolutionary movement in our country. In 1926, in order to oppose the right-leaning opportunism and "left"-leaning opportunism that existed in the Party at that time, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote the article "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," which made a brilliant and profound analysis of the political and economic conditions of the various classes in our society. Through class analysis, he solved the problem of the proletariat's leadership over the revolution, the importance of the peasant allies, and the two-sidedness of the national bourgeoisie, thus determining the correct class line of our revolution and stipulating the correct strategies and tactics of our revolutionary struggle. Under the leadership of the proletariat, the Chinese revolution united all the forces that could be united, formed a broad united front with various revolutionary classes and strata, and concentrated its efforts to attack the main enemies of the revolution. During the period of socialist construction, Comrade Mao Zedong again used the method of class analysis to draw a clear line of demarcation of the two different types of contradictions, contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people, pointing out different methods of handling them, thereby mobilizing all positive factors to serve socialist construction.

It is precisely because Comrade Mao Zedong vividly applied revolutionary dialectics in analyzing objective things that he was always able to grasp the essence and internal connections of things and determine correct policies and guidelines.

When studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, we must also study his thinking on continuous revolution. As early as during the democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the democratic revolution is a necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable trend of the democratic revolution. And the ultimate goal of all communists is to strive for the final completion of socialist and communist societies. This pointed out the socialist future of the Chinese revolution and solved the problem of where China should go after the victory of the democratic revolution. After the victory of the democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong criticized the claim of "consolidating the new democratic order" that attempted to maintain capitalism for a long time, and promptly put forward the general line of the socialist revolution while quickly completing some tasks left over from the democratic revolution. After the socialist revolution in terms of ownership was victoriously completed, Comrade Mao Zedong again led the people of the whole country to achieve the great victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and put forward the general line of socialist construction and the slogans of technical revolution and cultural revolution. In this way, our revolutionary cause advanced from one victory to another without losing any opportunity.

When studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, we should also particularly study his attitude towards new things. Comrade Mao Zedong is our best example in dealing with new things. No matter how weak the new things may seem, he always firmly stood on the side of the new things, pointing out their brilliant future and actively nurturing their growth. When the revolution failed in 1927 and the revolutionary forces seemed very small compared with the counter-revolutionary forces, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote a very famous article, "A single spark can start a prairie fire," to illustrate that the flames of revolution would surely sweep the country. Hasn't the development of events fully proved the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's prediction? Regarding the seemingly powerful, ferocious imperialism and reactionary forces, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the brilliant conclusion that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." The current international situation of "the East wind prevailing over the West wind" proves the complete correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's conclusion. The same is true when it comes to the issue of our country's people's communes. When this kind of social organization was first born, Comrade Mao Zedong immediately put forward the call "The people's commune is good," pointing out that this new thing has a strong vitality and a great hope and future, powerfully refuting the various accusations of the right-leaning opportunists against the people's communes, and continuously promoting the development and consolidation of the people's communes.

Finally, when studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, we must better study his attitude towards revolutionary mass movements and the working method of the mass line. Marxists have always believed that only the people are the real creators of human history, and have always attached great importance to the wisdom and creativity of the people. Comrade Mao Zedong has always advocated that to lead the revolutionary movement and be a good teacher for the masses, we must first be good students of the masses, rely on the masses, trust the masses, and proceed from the interests of the masses in everything. He said: "We should go among the masses, learn from the masses, synthesize their experiences, become better organized principles and methods, and then tell the masses (propaganda), and call on the masses to implement them, solve the problems of the masses, and liberate and make the masses happy." This is the revolutionary methodology of "from the masses, to the masses" that Comrade Mao Zedong has always advocated. For decades, Comrade Mao Zedong has always been with the working people. He is the great leader of the people and also an ordinary member of the people. He takes the joy of the masses as his joy and the worries of the masses as his worries. He fully trusts and relies on the wisdom and strength of the masses, treats every achievement of the mass movement with full enthusiasm, and stands in front of the masses to lead them, help them summarize the experience of struggle, and point out the direction of victory.

    学习毛泽东思想　争取更大的胜利
    总结革命和建设的经验
    根据十年来，特别是两年来大跃进的经验，要多快好省地完成建设任务，最根本的一条是善于掌握和运用毛泽东思想。
    毛泽东思想的正确性，是经过长期历史考验过的，是经过中国各族人民的革命斗争考验过的。革命实践是革命理论的试金石。毛泽东思想的正确性，不仅为中国民主革命与社会主义革命两个革命阶段和在这两个阶段中党所制定的民主革命的、社会主义革命的、社会主义建设的三条总路线所证实，而且为中国民族问题的胜利解决所证实，为内蒙古自治区建设的正确道路所证实。
    毛泽东思想的重要特点是把马克思主义的普遍真理和中国革命实践相结合，也就是根据马克思列宁主义的普遍真理从中国的实际出发来解决中国的革命和建设问题，并且在不断的革命实践中不断地丰富着和发展着马克思列宁主义。
    毛泽东同志在任何革命阶段，都对中国实际情况和政治形势进行着马克思列宁主义的阶级分析，指明各个时期的主要矛盾，并且提出解决这一矛盾的一系列的基本政策。毛泽东同志在民主革命中一分钟也没有忘记我们还要进行社会主义革命，在社会主义革命中，一分钟也没有忘记我们要把社会主义革命进行到底并且还要向共产主义过渡，所以总是注意确立和巩固无产阶级领导权，不断地和各种非马克思主义的思想作斗争，实行无产阶级的极端坚定的阶级政策，按照中国的条件，把马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论结合起来，引导中国革命从一个胜利到另一个胜利。
    内蒙古自治区的建设成就，同样证明毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理。区域自治政策是正确解决民族问题的马克思列宁主义的政策。在民族问题上，党既反对了大汉族主义，也反对了地方民族主义；既从政治上建立起来各民族之间的团结友爱新关系，又从经济文化建设上逐步消除着民族间的事实上的不平等。根据毛泽东思想结合内蒙古实际进行建设，这正是内蒙古自治区建设取得伟大成就的根本因素。所以，十二年来，哪些根据毛泽东思想就作对了，哪些不根据毛泽东思想就作错了，是需要认真研究的。这是我区理论工作者的首要任务。
    理论是为政治服务的。马克思列宁主义的理论是为无产阶级政治服务的。当前我们的理论工作，必须与宣传总路线相结合，必须和深入社会主义革命斗争与加速社会主义建设进度相结合。为此，我们就应当根据毛泽东同志的指导思想和工作方法，按照“两条腿走路”的方针，系统研究毛泽东思想和广泛宣传毛泽东思想相结合，普及和提高相结合，在自治区各个战线上大力培养成千上万的理论干部，结合自治区的实际，总结我们的革命与建设经验，只有这样，才能有理论工作的大跃进。

    学习毛泽东著作的重大意义
    认真地学习毛泽东同志的著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来武装自己，这是一件具有重要意义的事情。在学习毛泽东同志的著作的时候，主要地应该学习些什么呢？
    首先必须学习的是毛泽东同志的坚定不移的无产阶级革命立场。学习毛泽东同志在革命事业困难的关头，是怎样始终如一地保持着高度的革命乐观主义的精神和坚毅不摧的毅力的。例如，当1927年第一次国内革命战争失败，全国革命处于低潮的时候，毛泽东同志就批判了那种对革命事业的悲观思想和论调，指出革命的高潮是不可避免的，并且会很快地到来。当红军长征北上，革命力量受到很大削弱，某些人散布失败论调的时候，毛泽东同志批判了这种失败论调，指出了长征的胜利和它的重大意义。当1946年蒋介石在美帝国主义支持下，发动反人民的内战，反动军队无论在数量和装备上都占显著优势的时候，毛泽东同志就指出：“我们所依靠的不过是小米加步枪，但是历史最后将证明，这小米加步枪比蒋介石的飞机加坦克还要强些。……反动派总有一天要失败，我们总有一天要胜利。”在民主革命胜利以后，毛泽东同志又批判了那种认为中国经济落后因而对经济复兴产生悲观的论点，指出“中国经济建设的速度将不是很慢而可能是相当地快的，中国的兴盛是可以计日程功的。”在革命斗争的每一个重要关头，毛泽东同志总是根据马克思列宁主义的科学，指出革命事业必将胜利，引导着全国人民勇往直前地迈进。
    学习毛泽东同志在考察和分析问题的时候，极其深刻地运用了马克思列宁主义的科学方法。毛泽东同志就是运用阶级分析的方法来解决了我国革命运动中一系列重大问题的。1926年，毛泽东同志为了反对当时党内存在的右倾机会主义和“左”倾机会主义，写成了“中国社会各阶级的分析”一文，对我国社会各个阶级的政治、经济状况作了精辟的、深刻的分析。通过阶级分析，解决了无产阶级对革命的领导权问题、农民同盟军的重要性问题以及民族资产阶级的两面性问题，从而确定了我国革命的正确的阶级路线，规定了我国革命斗争的正确的战略和策略。使我国革命在无产阶级的领导下，团结了一切可以团结的力量，与各个革命的阶级和阶层结成了广泛的统一战线，集中地打击了革命的主要敌人。在社会主义建设时期，毛泽东同志又运用阶级分析的方法，划清了敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾这两类不同性质矛盾的界限，指出了不同的处理方法，从而调动了一切积极因素为社会主义建设服务。
    正是由于毛泽东同志在分析客观事物时生动地运用了革命的辩证法，所以，他总是能够抓住事物的本质和内在联系，并且确定正确的方针和政策。
    学习毛泽东同志的著作，还必须学习他的不断革命的思想。毛泽东同志早在民主革命时期就指出：民主主义革命是社会主义革命的必要准备，社会主义革命是民主主义革命的必然趋势。而一切共产主义者的最后目的，则是在于力争社会主义社会和共产主义社会的最后的完成。这就指明了中国革命的社会主义前途，解决了民主革命胜利后的中国向何处去的问题。民主革命胜利后，毛泽东同志批判了那种企图长期保持资本主义的所谓“巩固新民主主义秩序”的主张，在迅速完成民主革命遗留下来的某些任务的时候就及时地提出了社会主义革命的总路线。当所有制方面的社会主义革命胜利完成之后，毛泽东同志又领导全国人民取得了政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的伟大胜利，并且提出了社会主义建设的总路线和技术革命、文化革命的口号。这样，就使得我国革命事业不失时机地由一个胜利前进到另一个新胜利。
    学习毛泽东同志的著作，还特别应该学习他的对待新生事物的态度。在对待新生事物的态度上，毛泽东同志是我们的最好的典范。不管新生的事物看起来是多么弱小，但是，他总是坚定地站在新生事物的这一方面，指出它的灿烂前途，积极地培育它成长。当1927年革命失败，革命力量与反革命力量比较起来似乎是很微小的时候，毛泽东同志写了“星星之火，可以燎原”这样一篇非常著名的文章，来说明革命的烈火必将燃遍全国，事实的发展不是完全证明了毛泽东同志的这一预言的正确吗？对于貌似强大、张牙舞爪的帝国主义和反动势力，毛泽东同志提出了“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断，当前国际上“东风压倒西风”的形势，又证明了毛泽东同志的论断的完全正确。在对待我国的人民公社问题上也是如此。当人民公社这种社会组织刚刚诞生的时候，毛泽东同志立即就提出了“人民公社好”的号召，指出这一新生事物具有强大的生命力，有着伟大的希望和前途，有力地批驳了右倾机会主义者对人民公社的种种责难，不断地促进了人民公社的发展和巩固。
    最后，学习毛泽东同志的著作，我们更要很好地学习他对待革命的群众运动的态度和群众路线的工作方法。马克思主义者从来就认为，只有人民群众才是人类历史的真正创造者，从来就极端重视人民群众的智慧和创造性。毛泽东同志从来就主张，要领导革命运动，当好群众的先生，首先就要当好群众的学生，依靠群众，信任群众，处处从群众的利益出发。他说：“我们应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习，把他们的经验综合起来，成为更好的有条理的道理和办法，然后再告诉群众（宣传），并号召群众实行起来，解决群众的问题，使群众得到解放和幸福。”这也就是毛泽东同志历来所主张的“从群众中来，到群众中去”的革命方法论。几十年来，毛泽东同志始终与劳动群众在一起，他是人民群众的伟大领袖，同时也是人民群众中普通的一员。他以群众之乐为乐，以群众之忧为忧。他充分信任和依靠群众的智慧和力量，满腔热情地对待群众运动的每一个成就，并且站在群众的前面领导他们，帮助他们总结斗争的经验，指出胜利的方向。
