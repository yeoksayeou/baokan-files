Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch: Taipei – US Secretary of the Army Bruck, in Taiwan, openly clamored that the United States would use force to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, Penghu, and the offshore islands such as Jinmen and Mazu. According to American news agencies, Bruck said at a press conference in Taipei that "the United States will defend the coastal islands of Nationalist China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group)" to counter "Red China's aggression." He yelled, "Washington will not draw any lines if the Communists launch an attack in the Formosa Strait." The United Press International dispatch from Taipei on the 10th believed that Bruck's naked provocation "appears to go a big step further than anything any other senior US government official has said."

Bruck also clamored that the United States is "constantly paying attention to the situation in this area and is always considering increasing its forces in this area." He made it clear that his visit to Taiwan was to intensify provocations against China. He said, "I hope that my coming here will focus our attention on the ever-expanding crisis of the Communists. We must constantly besiege this crisis, and we must always develop our defense forces to the maximum."

Bruck arrived in Taiwan on the 10th. In Taiwan, he held two talks with Chiang Kai-shek. He also listened to reports from the US Taiwan Defense Command, the US Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, and the Chiang Kai-shek group's so-called "Ministry of National Defense," and inspected the "Nike-Hercules" missile battalion transferred by the United States to the Chiang army. He left Taipei at noon on the 12th for Okinawa, and then to South Korea, Japan and other places.

    美陆军部长曾到台湾活动
    竟叫嚣要加紧对我国挑衅
    新华社12日讯　台北消息：美国陆军部长布鲁克在台湾公开叫嚣，美国要用武力来阻挠我国人民解放台湾、澎湖以及金门、马祖等我国内海岛屿。据美国通讯社报道，布鲁克在台北举行的记者招待会上说，“美国将保卫国民党中国（指蒋介石集团）的沿海岛屿”，来对付“红色中国的侵略”。他叫嚷说：“如果共产党人在福摩萨海峡发动攻击，华盛顿不会划什么界线。”美联社台北10日发出的电讯认为，布鲁克这种赤裸裸的挑衅，“看来比美国政府其他任何高级官员所说过的话更大大地进了一步”。
    布鲁克还叫嚣说，美国“经常在注意着这一地区的情势，时时在考虑着增加这一地区的兵力”。他明白表示，他到台湾去是为了加紧向我国进行挑衅。他说，“我愿因我来到这里，而使我们的注意力集中到共党不断的扩张危机上来。我们对于这种危机必须不停地围攻，我们必须经常使我们的防卫力量发展到最大限度。”
    布鲁克是10日到台湾的。他在台湾与蒋介石举行了两次会谈。他还听取了侵台美军司令部、美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团和蒋介石集团的所谓“国防部”的汇报，并且视察了由美国移交给蒋军的“奈克—赫尔克里士”式导弹营。他已在12日中午离开台北前去冲绳，转往南朝鲜、日本等地。
