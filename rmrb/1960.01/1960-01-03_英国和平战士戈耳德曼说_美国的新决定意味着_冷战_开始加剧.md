    Xinhua News Agency, London, January 2nd. TASS dispatch from London on January 1st: The long peace march across Britain, initiated by participants in the British "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament," entered its seventh day today.
    According to newspaper reports, after U.S. President Eisenhower issued a statement announcing that the United States would be free to resume nuclear weapons testing after December 31, 1959, the resolve of these peace demonstrators to oppose nuclear war was further strengthened.
    Goldmann, chairman of the National Youth Organization of the British "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament," said, "The recent decision made by the United States may mean that the 'Cold War' has begun with greater intensity. We must not allow Germany (West Germany) to possess nuclear weapons. Ordinary people like us should strive to stop the 'Cold War' in 1960."

    英国和平战士戈耳德曼说
    美国的新决定意味着“冷战”开始加剧
    新华社2日讯　塔斯社伦敦1日讯：英国“争取裁减核军备运动”参加者发起的横穿英国的长途和平游行今天进入了第七天。
    据报纸报道，在美国总统艾森豪威尔发表声明宣布美国在1959年12月31日以后将有自由恢复核武器试验之后，这些参加和平示威的人反对核战争的意志更加坚定了。
    英国“争取裁减核军备运动”全国青年组织主席戈耳德曼说，“美国新近作出的决定可能意味着，‘冷战’已经以更大的紧张程度在开始。我们不应当让德国（西德）拥有核武器。像我们这样的普通人应当力争在1960年停止‘冷战’。”
