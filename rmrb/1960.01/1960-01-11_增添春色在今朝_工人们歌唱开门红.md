Adding Spring Colors This Morning
——Workers Sing of a Flying Start

The train faces the morning sun
Beijing Railway Bureau
Guye Locomotive Depot
Li Zifang
The train opens facing the morning sun, brilliant rays shine in;
Driving the dragon riding the wind, fully motivated, the speed is fast.
The train opens facing the morning sun, the east is a piece of red glory;
Thousands of miles of flat mirror railway lines, high mountains and giant ridges all give way.
The train opens facing the morning sun, the red sun slowly rises;
I look at the commune's harvest scenery, smiling on my face, joy in my heart.
The train opens facing the morning sun, thousands of songs and ten thousand songs sing;
Singing the Party's good leadership, singing the motherland ten thousand years!

Ode to the "One Dragon"
Wang Yuqing
The entire country's railway is a "one dragon", cooperation and competition are red everywhere,
The east wind rushes, sending a steel dragon, galloping ten thousand miles, showing great power.
The dragon raises its head, steel rails are laid in ten thousand mountains;
The dragon swings its tail, spanning great rivers and huge rivers with long rainbows;
The dragon stretches its waist, ten thousand tons of goods are pulled away;
The dragon dances, the flying start comes, redder every day.

　　At noon, the red sun shines overhead, the high-pitched loudspeakers transmit good news,
　　Half a day to complete a day's task, adding spring colors this morning.

　　The factory director and secretary offer congratulations, looking up at the indicators, laughter is long.

Welcoming the New Year

Leap Forward flowers bloom, red fills the sky, thousands of miles of good news spread across the land,
Tidings of victory are colorful like snowflakes, fully motivated to welcome the Leap Forward year!

Mounting the Leap Forward Horse

Mount the Leap Forward horse, holding the big flag in hand;
Commanding this year's January, to bloom February's flowers of victory everywhere.

Good News Dyed Red
Qilian Snow
Lanzhou Kang Pingxiao
The team reporting good news is so many, the stream of people is like an oil river.
Tighten the drums, tighten the gongs, good news dyes the Qilian snow red.

Red Flag Inserted to the End
Lanzhou Zuo Chi
January 1st, 1960, I give the lathe a New Year's gift,
Insert a big red flag at the opening, whoosh, so magical.
I understand the lathe's old temper, it likes to insert red flags every day,
Insert from the beginning of the year to the end of the twelfth lunar month, 365 is a must.

Report! Report! Report!
Lanzhou Qi Jian
Set off firecrackers on the thirtieth night, magpies chirp on the first day of the New Year.
Magpies chirp, good news arrives: Last year was a complete success, this year's opening brings good news.
The New Year's bell has just struck, reports of "report, report" come from everywhere!
Report, report, report: heroes from all fronts, launched the first shot of the opening.

Flying Start
(Sixteen-Character Verse)
Lanzhou Tao Zunle
Open, winter goes, spring comes, hundreds of flowers bloom;
Make revolution, every second radiates brilliance.
Door, hundreds of riders break through the barrier thinking of tricks, wave steel knives, difficult passes become flying dust!
Red, seeing off the old and welcoming the new, the spring tide surges, looking at the factory buildings, good news is the red of the waves.

    李子芳列车迎着朝霞开，绚丽霞光射进来；驾龙乘风鼓足干劲速度快。列车迎着朝霞开，东方一片红光彩；千里平镜铁路线，高山巨岭齐让开。列车迎着朝霞开，红日徐徐升起来；我望公社丰收景，笑在面庞喜在怀。列车迎着朝霞开，千歌万歌唱起来，歌颂党的好领导，歌唱祖国万万岁！“一条龙”颂
    王余庆全国铁路一条龙，协作竞赛遍地红，东风哗哗送钢龙，奔腾万里显神通。龙抬头，钢轨铺进万山丛；龙摆尾，大江巨川跨长虹；龙伸腰，万吨货物拉走了；龙飞舞，开门红来日日红。厂长书记贺喜
