Skillful Workers Conquer the Bayan Gorge
·Qinghai Railway News Reporter·
    The Bayan Gorge construction site of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway is the first work site of the Xining Railway Bureau to move from carrying loads with shoulder poles and baskets to mechanized and semi-mechanized construction. Since construction began, the conditions here have changed dramatically.
    The Bayan Gorge project is one of the key projects for the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway's advance into the Qaidam Basin. This gorge is located in the middle reaches of the Sichuan River, stretching for more than ten miles from north to south. The gorge is deep, with dangerous mountains and rapid waters. The railway must wind upwards, with the tracks forming two "light bulb" shapes before extending into the vast grasslands. There is a large bridge here, with an average height of over twenty-eight meters; within one square kilometer, 820,000 cubic meters of earth and stone must be excavated and filled. At the large fill, the roadbed is as high as twenty-three meters and as wide as eighty-four meters at the bottom. After the roadbed is built, it will resemble a Great Wall winding around the mountains. The first time we came to this work site, an engineering captain pointed to a mountain to the east and said: all the earth and stone from this mountain will be used to fill this Great Wall-like roadbed, and that mountain must be moved here within a year and a half.
    At that time, they were entirely relying on shoulder poles and baskets to deal with this arduous project. In those days of swirling snow, they spread out in long lines from the top to the bottom of the mountain. The young men carried pointed baskets of earth, all at a trot. In such cold weather, they only wore a single layer of clothing, and sweat kept pouring from their heads. The workers' will was strong, but human strength is ultimately limited. A person, working hard, could only move two or three cubic meters a day. After working fiercely for more than a month, they had only broken the skin of the mountain they were supposed to level; the deep valley they were supposed to fill for the roadbed had not even been covered at the bottom.
    "How can we continue like this?"
    "We should find a way through technical innovation." Many employees of the 101st Engineering Zone of the Xining Railway Bureau, which was responsible for this project, came to this conclusion.
    Their first step towards mechanization and semi-mechanization was to implement small-scale mechanization, that is, to replace shoulder poles and baskets with wheelbarrows, flatbed carts, and frame carts, and to install ball bearings on all of them. As a result, production efficiency improved significantly, and some people were satisfied. They said, "Given the conditions of the engineering zone, we can't make any more sophisticated machinery; if we are not satisfied with these production tools, then we can only request that the higher authorities allocate large machinery."
    "We don't listen to that kind of talk. Roads are made by people. We'll do whatever is beneficial to construction." At this time, work team leader Yu Qingheng and several workers began to study and trial-produce rebar track tipper trucks. They found some scrap boards and scrap iron themselves. When the comrades were asleep at night, they would run to the iron workshop and the wood workshop to work. The most difficult thing about manufacturing rebar track tipper trucks was making the groove on the wheel rim. They had no casting equipment, and the wheels were all hammered out. There was no way to hammer the groove on the wheel rim, so they tried to make a file out of thick rebar heated and hammered, and filed it little by little by hand. They worked hard and cleverly like this and finally successfully trial-produced the rebar track tipper truck.
    The next day, when it was taken to the team for use, the comrades praised it highly. First, it had tracks, could carry more, and was light. Second, it could automatically dump the soil. Third, using rebar as tracks not only overcame the difficulty of not having small steel rails, but also made it easy to move the site.
    Subsequently, many new inventions and creations appeared one after another at the construction site.
    Now, if you come to this construction site, you can see rows of frame carts climbing onto the roadbed without being pulled by people. Its power is not in front of your eyes, but on the river behind the mountain. There, the employees have built two small hydropower stations using indigenous methods. Using hydropower to generate electricity drives the homemade small electric hoists on this side to pull the rows of frame carts. The workers only need to load and dump the carts. There is also a kind of power in the sky: tall windmills, using the power of the wind to crank the carts uphill.
    In the large fill area, six trains of earth-carrying carts run opposite each other. There is no locomotive pulling them, and no machinery pulling them can be seen; only small flags are waving up and down, and the trains come and go like the wind. Looking closely, you can see that this is running by taking advantage of the natural slope, using heavy carts to pull light carts. Even more interesting is the wooden water turbine at the bridge construction site. It is a not-very-large round wooden wheel that is driven by water. It can parallel tow carts to transport things, and it can also hoist flagstone and cement onto the carts. Moreover, it is flexible and easy to operate, more obedient than cranes and winches. Elsewhere, making reinforced concrete culverts is generally done by manual compaction, but here they have created a very simple electric internal mold vibration pipe loading device, which greatly improves efficiency compared to manual compaction...
    Now, the workers can each complete more than seven cubic meters of earthwork a day without feeling tired at all. Cultural studies and recreational activities on the construction site are also being carried out vigorously.

    能工巧战巴燕峡
    ·青海铁道报记者·
    兰青铁路巴燕峡工地，是西宁铁路局第一个由扁担大筐走上机械化、半机械化施工的工点。从开工到现在，这里的施工状况发生了惊人的变化。
    巴燕峡工程，是兰青铁路向柴达木挺进的关键工程之一。这道峡谷位于西川河中游，南北绵亘十多里。峡谷深处，山险水急。铁路经过这里，要迂回升高，线路叠成两个“电灯泡”形，而后伸向辽阔的草原。这里有一座大桥，平均高度在二十八米以上；在一平方公里之内，就要挖填土石方八十二万方。在大填方处，路基高达二十三米，底部宽八十四米。路基筑成后，就像盘环在山间的长城。我们第一次来到这个工点，一位工程队长指着东面的一座山说：要用这座山的全部土石，来填起这长城般的路基，并且要在一年半的时间内，把那座山搬来。
    那时，他们全是靠着扁担大筐，来对付这艰巨的工程。在那风雪弥漫的日子里，他们从山上到山下摆开了长阵。小伙子们担起带尖的土筐，全是小跑。那样冷的天气，他们只穿一件单布衫，头上还不住地冒着热汗。工人们的意志是坚强的，但是，人的体力究竟是有限的。一个人使大劲，一天只能干两三方。这样狠干了一个多月，他们所要削平的那座山，只不过是碰破了一点皮；他们要填起来作路基的那片深谷，连谷底还没有盖上。
    “这样干下去怎么行呢？”
      “应该从技术革新方面想办法。”担任这处工程的西宁铁路局一○一工区的许多职工都得出了这样的结论。
    他们向机械化半机械化迈进的第一步，是实现小型机具化，也就是用独轮车、平板车、架子车代替扁担大筐，并且都装上滚珠轴承。这样一来，生产效率提高了不少，有人便满足了。他们说：“根据工区的条件，也不能再制作出更高妙的机具来了；要是不满足于这些生产工具，那就只有请求上级调拨大型机械来。
    “我们可不听他那一套，路是人走出来的，怎么对施工有利，我们就怎么干。”就在这时候，工班长于庆恒和几个工人开始研究试制钢筋轨道翻板车了。他们自己找了一些废板子和废铁。等到晚上，同志们都睡着了，就跑到铁工房和木工房干起来。制造钢筋轨道翻板车，最困难的是做轮圆上的槽。他们没有翻砂设备，车轮都是硬打出来的。轮圆上的槽可没办法打，他们就设法把粗钢筋沾火作成锉，用人工一点一点地锉。他们就是这样苦干巧干，终于把钢筋轨道翻板车试制成功了。
    第二天拿到班里使用，同志们都很称赞。因为第一，它有了轨道，装得多，又轻巧。第二，运土可以自动倒。第三，用钢筋作轨道，不但克服了没有小钢轨的困难，而且转移工地搬动也方便了。
    接着许多新的发明创造，就一个一个地在工地上出现了。
    现在你到这工地上来，能够看到不用人拉就成列向路基上爬的架子车。它的动力不在你的眼前，而在山背后的河上。那里，职工们用土办法修起了两座小型水电站。利用河水发电，带动这边自制的小型电动卷扬机，来牵引成列的架子车。工人们只要装装车、倒倒车就行了。还有一种动力是在天上：那是高大的风车，利用风的力量来绞动车子爬坡。
    在大填方的地方，相对开着六趟运土的列车，既没有车头牵引，也看不到有机械拉拽；只见小旗上下挥舞，列车便来去如飞。仔细看，才能发现这是借着自然坡度，用重车拉轻车的办法来运行的。更有趣的是大桥工地上的木制水轮机。它是一个被水打动的不很大的圆木轮子，能平行牵引车子运输东西，又能向车上吊送片石、水泥，而且操纵起来灵活自如，比吊车、卷扬机还要听使唤。在别处，制钢筋混凝土涵管，一般都是用人工捣固，这里却创造了一个非常简单的电力内模震动装管器，比人工捣固大大提高了效率……。
    现在，工人们每人一天可以完成七方多土的工程，一点也不觉得累。工地上的文化学习和文娱活动，也活跃地开展起来了。
