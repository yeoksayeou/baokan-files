    As one approaches the residence of the Dengdian Production Team in the Lutou Commune of Zao Yang County, Hubei Province, a chorus of songs echoing across the wilderness greets you on the breeze. Upon entering the production team, you are met with fences full of poetry and huge murals. Many visitors from other places can't help but recite those passionate poems and admire those moving paintings. These poems and paintings are all creations of the members of the Dengdian Production Team during the cultural upsurge.

    In the evening, just as the members are finishing their day of intense labor and returning home, good news comes from the village: "The club will hold an evening party tonight. We hope that the members will actively participate..." Hearing that there is an evening party, the members happily forget the fatigue of the day, hurriedly put down their farm tools to wash their faces and change clothes, and after eating, they walk to the club in groups of three or five. Before long, the club is packed with people, and the performance begins. Yugu (a type of drum storytelling), Gaohe tunes, small operas...there are so many kinds! One wonderful evening program after another ends with applause. However, the members' excited mood cannot calm down for a long time. They praise and discuss the amateur actors and the plot of the play that they are familiar with.

    As early as 1952, under the leadership of the Party branch, the young people of Dengdian formed a cultural troupe to sing and dance for the farmers. With the improvement of the members' production and life, the literary and art team has also continued to grow. In 1956, they established the first club in Zao Yang County. Over the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, the club has closely revolved around the Party's production center in various periods, taking local materials, creating whatever they do, and singing whatever they do. They use more than a dozen literary and artistic forms, such as poems, clapper talks, yugu, zhuizi (a form of storytelling), tunes, operas, and cartoons, to praise the new people and new things in the production of the members, and to encourage the labor enthusiasm of the members. Since the winter of 1957, they have created more than 290 opera pieces, 54 songs, and 6 dances. The literary and art team has increased from more than 20 people to more than 250 people. In addition to regular performances, the club also goes deep into the fields and water conservancy construction sites to perform for the masses.

    However, when the Party branch began to mobilize the masses to engage in large-scale cultural activities, it also encountered many obstacles. Some people said: "Creation is not simple. Relying on the masses will not produce anything famous." Some people said: "Writing poetry and painting are things for scholars. We are just muddy-legged farmers and don't understand such things." At that time, if the masses' mysterious views were not dispelled, it would be impossible to carry out mass cultural activities. Yang LiLan was originally an ordinary farm girl. Under the cultivation of the Party, she is now not only a cotton production expert, but also a well-known farmer poet and singer in the county. The Party branch used typical examples like Yang LiLan to enlighten and encourage the masses. Once, Yang LiLan, the deputy director of the club, was eating in the canteen when she saw female member Li Guo Ping walking into the canteen, jumping and bouncing, while humming a Yangko tune: "Chairman Mao is really good, leading women to stand up. No need to light the stove, no need to cook, the children are sent to the kindergarten..." As soon as Yang LiLan heard this, she happily asked: "Sister Li, who taught you this song!" Li Guo Ping replied inexplicably: "No one taught me!" "Then how did you sing it?" "I just sang it out of my heart when I was happy!" "Good! Isn't this your creation?" When Li Guo Ping heard Yang LiLan say this, she ran into the canteen happily and shyly.

    When the masses saw that creation was not difficult, their concerns were dispelled, and a mass literary and artistic activity and creation activity immediately flourished in the Dengdian Production Team. More than 900 of the team's 1,800 people participated in poetry and painting creation activities, and more than 1,500 people learned to sing. Each small team opened up a "Poetry and Painting Garden," and the entire production team presented a lively scene of walls full of paintings, fences full of poetry, and fields full of songs. Mass self-compiled, self-sung, and self-performed cultural activities formed a vigorous upsurge.

    The reason why the cultural activities of the Dengdian Production Team's club are so vigorous is the result of the Party's leadership. The Production Team's Party Branch attaches great importance to the club's mass cultural activities, and regards carrying out mass cultural activities as a powerful weapon for educating the masses, inspiring the masses, and promoting the great leap in production. Guo De Yu, the secretary of the Party branch, personally took command, and listed leading mass cultural activities as one of the regular tasks of the Party branch. When arranging and inspecting production, they always combine the arrangement and inspection of cultural work, and regularly organize mass appraisals to continuously commend the advanced and carry out the movement to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced. The Party branch also attaches great importance to the training of cultural activity backbones. In addition to regularly allowing backbones to participate in certain production meetings and organizing them to study politics and business, they also boldly entrust them with tasks so that they can be tempered and improved in practical work. In order to make the backbones closely linked to reality, understand reality, participate in production, and reflect production, the Party branch mobilized all the backbones of the club to participate in planting experimental fields, so that they not only became vanguards on the cultural front, but also experts in production, thereby more timely creating works with a strong flavor of life.

    诗满栏画满墙的文化乡
    本报记者  蒋顺章
    人们一走近湖北枣阳县鹿头公社邓店生产队的驻地，一阵阵响彻在旷野上的歌声，便随着微风迎面传来。进入生产队后，那满栏的诗篇和一幅幅巨大的壁画，就展现在眼前了。许多外地的参观者，情不自禁地朗诵着那些激情的诗篇，赞赏着那动人的画幅。这些诗和画，都是邓店生产队社员们在文化高潮中创作的。
    傍晚，正当社员们结束了一天紧张的劳动收工回家的时候，村头上传来了好消息：“今晚俱乐部开晚会，希望社员们踊跃参加……。”听说有晚会，社员们高兴得忘掉了一天的疲劳，急急忙忙地放下农具就洗脸换衣，吃罢饭后就三五成群地向俱乐部走去。不一会，俱乐部里被人群挤得满满的，演出活动开始了。渔鼓、高合曲子、小型歌剧，……种类可多啦！精采的晚会节目，一个接一个地在掌声中闭幕。但是，社员们激动的心情，久久不能平静。他们赞美地议论着自己所熟悉的业余演员，剧中的情节。
    早在1952年，邓店的年轻人就在党支部的领导下成立了文工团，为农民唱歌跳舞。随着社员的生产和生活的提高，文艺队伍也不断壮大了。到1956年，他们建立了枣阳县第一个俱乐部。几年来，俱乐部在党的领导下，紧密地围绕着党在各个时期的生产中心，就地取材，干啥编啥唱啥，把社员群众在生产中的新人新事，通过群众喜闻乐见的诗歌、快板、渔鼓、坠子、曲子、歌剧、漫画等十几种文艺形式来颂扬，鼓舞社员的劳动干劲。自1957年冬天以来，他们创作了曲剧二百九十多个，歌曲五十四支，舞蹈六个。文艺队伍由二十多人增加到二百五十多人，俱乐部除定期演出外，还深入到田间地头、水利工地为群众表演。
    但是，党支部在开始发动群众大搞文化活动的时候，也遇到不少障碍。有人说：“创作这玩艺不简单，靠群众是搞不出名堂来的。”有人说：“写诗作画是秀才的事，我们这样泥巴腿，真不沾弦。”当时不解除群众的神秘观点，就不可能开展群众性的文化活动。杨立兰原来是个普通的农家姑娘，她在党的培养下，现在成为一个既是棉花生产能手，又是全县有名的农民诗人和歌唱家。党支部就以杨立兰这样的典型来启发群众、鼓励群众。有一次，俱乐部副主任杨立兰正在食堂吃饭，看到女社员李国平一边跳跳蹦蹦走进食堂，一边嘴里哼着秧歌调：“毛主席，真正好，领导妇女翻身了。不烧锅，不做饭，娃子送到幼儿园……。”杨立兰一听高兴地问：“李姐，这歌儿谁教你的呀！”李国平莫名其妙的回答说：“没有谁教我呀！”“那你怎么唱的？”“我心里一高兴就顺口唱出来了呗！”“好！这不就是你的创作吗？”李国平听杨立兰这么一说，又喜又羞地一溜烟往食堂里跑了。
    群众看到创作并不难，顾虑打消了，一个群众性的文艺活动和创作活动立即在邓店生产队蓬勃展开。全队一千八百多人，就有九百多人参加了写诗画画的创作活动，有一千五百多人学会了歌唱。每个小队都开辟了“诗画园地”，全生产队就出现了画满墙，诗满栏，歌声满田园的生动场面。群众性的自编、自唱、自演的文化活动，形成了蓬蓬勃勃的高潮。
    邓店生产队俱乐部的文化活动所以生气蓬勃，是党领导的结果。生产队党支部对俱乐部开展群众性的文化活动很重视，把开展群众文化活动看成是教育群众、鼓舞群众、推动生产跃进的有力武器。党支部书记郭德育亲自挂帅，把领导群众文化活动列为党支部的经常工作之一。安排和检查生产时，总是结合安排和检查文化工作，并定期组织群众性的评比，不断地表扬先进，开展学先进、赶先进的运动。党支部还十分重视对文化活动骨干的培养，除经常让骨干参加一定的生产会议，并组织他们学习政治和业务外，还放手大胆的交给他们任务，使他们在实际工作中得到锻炼提高。为了使骨干紧紧地联系实际，了解实际，参加生产，反映生产，党支部动员了俱乐部所有的骨干都参加了种试验田，使他们不仅成为文化战线上的尖兵，并且也是生产上的能手，从而更及时地创作出具有浓厚生活气息的作品。
