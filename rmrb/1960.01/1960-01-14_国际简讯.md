	Venezuelan Reactionaries Create New Disturbances
	Caracas dispatch: Some agitators in Venezuela, on the 11th, took advantage of a demonstration of 5,000 unemployed workers demanding job opportunities and staged riots in the downtown area of Caracas.
	Under the instructions of reactionary conspirators, they began destructive activities after the unemployed workers' demonstration, burning cars and attacking shops and the police with stones. This riot is considered part of a series of terror and provocation activities carried out by reactionary conspirators to oppose the democratic order.

	The Venezuelan Workers' Confederation, some economic organizations, the three parties participating in the government, and the Communist Party immediately held meetings and decided to take joint measures to crush the reactionary disturbances, demanding that the government take strong measures to deal with the rebels and quickly and effectively solve the problem of the 5,000 unemployed workers.
