    The City's Lifelines
    By our correspondent Zhou Dingfang
    Opening the Beijing city traffic map, one sees seventy bus and trolley routes, like lifelines, tightly linking factories, schools, shops, residences, parks, people's communes, and cultural and entertainment venues scattered in every corner of the city.

    Serving Production, Facilitating Citizens
    Those living in Beijing will feel that the development speed of Beijing's urban public transportation is very fast. In recent years, with the expansion of the city area and the continuous increase of new industrial and residential areas, the total length of public bus and trolley operating routes has increased from more than forty kilometers before liberation to 853.4 kilometers. Now, residents in urban areas can take a bus or trolley not far from their residences.
    Serving production and facilitating citizens is Beijing's policy for developing urban transportation. Wherever there is an industrial area, a new larger residential area, or a large construction site, bus lines appear. When the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company expanded, the bus company opened a four-kilometer special line, running from the staff dormitory through the office all the way to the construction site. Later, it was discovered that the southern part of Shijingshan had no bus service, and many workers walked to and from work, so they immediately changed the straight east-to-north route into a circular route, adding new station names to the sign: "Machinery Factory," "Experimental Factory," "Coking Plant," "Canteen," "Ancient City Theater," "Dormitory No. 11"... Just looking at these station names, one can imagine how much convenience it brought to the employees of Shijingshan Iron and Steel.
    A year ago, the "Chemical Industry Zone" in the southeast suburbs of Beijing was still a wasteland. Since the first factory was built here, buses have accompanied them on these roads. As more and more factories were built, the number of bus routes increased from one or two to three. According to the bus company's statistics, more than half of the city's routes lead to industrial and mining enterprises and people's communes in the suburbs. Now, many large factories newly built in the near suburbs of Beijing have bus routes nearby. The furthest is to Mentougou, which is rich in coal mines, more than 30 kilometers long.
          Moving Towards Modernization
    In the trolley company's office, I met Qian Xingkuan, an old driver who drove Beijing's first tram. He told me about the changes since Beijing paved its first tram track in 1924. He said that before liberation, Beijing had only six routes and forty-seven old cars. The carriages were crowded and unsafe, and casualties often occurred. By the eve of liberation, only one bus route remained in the city, with five broken cars running on a six-kilometer route.
    At that time, the main means of transportation in Beijing were rickshaws and pedicabs. Now, rickshaws have long disappeared, and pedicabs have become auxiliary means of transportation. In addition to the two tram lines still remaining in the outer city, the main means of transportation on Beijing's streets have become buses, trolleybuses, and taxis. Some drivers and conductors who used to drive trams have been serving on trolleybuses after short-term training.
    Although the construction of trolleybuses has only been around for nearly three years, there are now 297 sky-blue trolleybuses running on ten routes. Recently, on the route from Beijing Zoo to Qianmen, people can also see a large streamlined trolleybus, with a carriage 15 meters long and connected by a folding canvas canopy in the middle, which can accommodate up to 240 passengers. This is a new product recently trial-produced by Beijing workers.
  Try Every Means to Shorten Passenger Waiting Time
    The increase in the number of means of transportation is only one aspect of the change in Beijing's public transportation. What passengers feel more prominently is the continuous improvement of service quality. Sometimes, you can often see someone at the station or on the bus, holding a small notebook, carefully recording the number of passengers getting on at each station and the interval time between vehicles. They are investigating passenger flow in order to better adjust routes and arrange vehicles for passengers. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, employees of the public transportation department have carefully studied the materials obtained from the investigation and created ten advanced vehicle scheduling methods. Every day during rush hours, dispatchers take measures such as multi-station departures, interval circulation, express buses at major stations returning empty, etc., to quickly transport passengers to factories, schools, government offices, and residential areas. On holidays, when you are worried that there are too many people to get on the bus, vehicles with "extra bus" and "direct express" signs will drive to your side and take you to parks, shops, or theaters. From the city to the famous scenic spots—the Summer Palace and the Ming Tombs—since the "direct express" service has been running, the travel time is almost one-half faster than ordinary buses. If there is a sudden surge in passengers, the route dispatcher will contact the general dispatching room and request vehicles from other routes to transport passengers.

    Wholeheartedly for Passengers
    Late at night, when the audience has enjoyed a wonderful drama or ball game, they all hope that public transportation can quickly send them home. The employees of the public transportation department are considerate of the passengers' feelings. Every night, when the People's Theater, the Capital Theater, the Beijing Gymnasium and other cultural and entertainment venues have not yet closed, buses and trolleybuses are parked at the door waiting for passengers. When the Beijing Workers' Stadium holds large-scale sports activities, there are nine specially opened temporary routes to transport passengers. In the eastern suburban industrial area and Beijing Railway Station, there are night buses running all night to serve workers and passengers on night shifts.
    Unexpected things often happen on buses or trolleys. Once, a passenger became seriously ill. The conductor, Wang Suoyin, asked him to lie on the leather chair while discussing with the driver to prepare to drive the bus directly to the nearby hospital without following the original route. They asked for the passengers' opinions, and the passengers unanimously said: It doesn't matter if it takes a little longer, it is important to rescue the patient. Then, the driver drove the bus as quickly as possible as a "temporary ambulance" all the way to the hospital entrance, and the conductor personally carried the passenger to the registration room to register for emergency treatment.
    The conductors' enthusiastic service to passengers has been warmly praised by workers and citizens. From January last year to now, the public transportation department has received more than 80,000 letters and commendations from passengers, thanking the conductors and drivers for their care for passengers.

    城市的纽带
    本报记者　周定舫
    打开北京市的市内交通图，人们看到七十条公共汽车和电车路线，像一条条纽带，把分布在全城各个角落的工厂、学校、商店、住宅、公园、人民公社和文化娱乐场所紧密地联结起来了。
    为生产服务　为市民方便
    住在北京的人，都会感到北京城市公共交通事业的发展速度是很快的。几年来，随着城市面积的扩大和新工业区、住宅区的不断增加，公共汽车和电车营业路线的总长度已由解放前的四十多公里增加到八百五十三点四公里。现在，市区居民在自己住宅附近，不用走多远，就能乘上汽车或电车。
    为生产服务，为市民方便，这是北京市发展城市交通的方针。哪里有了工业区、新的较大的住宅区或是大的建筑工地，哪里就出现了公共汽车的线路。石景山钢铁公司扩建了，公共汽车公司就开辟一条四公里长的专线，从职工宿舍经过办公室一直行驶到工地。后来发现石钢的南部因为没有汽车行驶，许多工人上下班都是步行，他们又立刻把这条从东到北直线行驶的路线改为环行路线，站牌上添上了新的站名：“机械厂”、“试验厂”“焦化厂”、“食堂”、“古城剧场”、“十一宿舍”……，只要看看这些站名，就能联想到它给石钢职工带来了多少方便。
    一年以前，北京东南郊的“化工区”还是一片荒地，自从这里兴建了第一座工厂，公共汽车也就伴随着行驶在这些道路上了。工厂越建越多，公共汽车路线也由一条、两条增加到三条，据公共汽车公司统计，全市有半数以上的路线是通往郊区的工矿企业和人民公社的。现在，北京在近郊区新建的许多大工厂附近，都有公共汽车路线。最远的是通到盛产煤矿的门头沟，全长三十多公里。
          向现代化迈进
    在电车公司的办公室里，我遇到了驾驶北京第一辆有轨电车的老司机钱兴宽，他向我叙述了1924年北京铺筑第一条电车轨道以来的变化。他说，解放前，北京只有六条路线，四十七辆旧车，车厢内拥挤不堪，行车又不安全，常常发生伤亡事故。到了解放前夕，城内的公共汽车路线只剩下一条，有五辆破车在六公里长的路线上行驶。
    当时北京的主要交通工具是人力车和三轮车。现在，人力车早已绝迹，三轮车也变成了辅助的交通工具了。除了在外城还保留着两条有轨电车外，行驶在北京街道上的主要交通工具，已经变成公共汽车、无轨电车和出租小汽车了。过去驾驶有轨电车的一些司机和售票员，经过短期训练，已经在无轨电车上服务了。
    建设无轨电车虽然只有近三年历史，现在已有二百九十七辆天蓝色车身的无轨电车行驶在十条线路上。最近，从北京动物园到前门这条线路上，人们还能看到一种大型的流线型的无轨电车，车厢长十五米、中间用折叠式帆布篷相联，最多能容纳二百四十个乘客。这是不久前北京工人试制的新产品。
  千方百计缩短乘客候车时间
    交通工具数量的增加，只是北京公共交通事业变化的一个方面，使乘客们感到更突出的是服务质量的不断提高。有时候，你在车站上或是汽车上，常常能看到一个人拿着小笔记本，仔细地记着各个车站上车的乘客人数和车辆的间隔时间。这是他们在调查乘客流量，以便更好地调整线路，为乘客们安排车辆。1958年大跃进以来，公共交通部门的职工们根据调查的材料，经过细心钻研，创造了十种先进的调车方法。每天上下班的时候，调度员们采取多站发车、区间循环、大站快车回程放空等方法，把乘客迅速地载送到工厂、学校、机关和住宅区。在假日，当你正在发愁人太多上不去车的时候，一辆辆挂着“加车”、“直达快车”牌子的车辆，就会开到你的面前，把你送到公园、商店或是剧场。从城内到著名的游览胜地——颐和园和十三陵，自从行驶“直达快车”以后，行车时间比一般车快了将近二分之一。如果遇到乘客突然猛增的情况，路线的调度员就会和总调度室联系，要求从别的线路上抽调车辆来载送乘客。
    一心为乘客
    深夜，当观众们欣赏了精采的戏剧或是球赛以后，都希望公共交通工具能够迅速地把他们送回家去。公共交通部门的职工们体贴到乘客的这种心情，每天晚上，当人民剧场、首都剧场、北京体育馆等文化娱乐场所还没有散场的时候，就有公共汽车和无轨电车停在门口等候乘客。遇到北京工人体育场举行盛大的体育活动，有专辟的九条临时路线来载送乘客。在东郊工业区和北京车站，有通宵行驶的夜班车，为上夜班的工人和旅客们服务。
    在公共汽车或电车上，经常会碰到一些十分意外的事情。一次，一位乘客得了急病，售票员王锁印一面请他躺在皮椅上，一面和司机商量，准备不按照原来路线行驶，把汽车直接开到附近的医院去。他们征求乘客们的意见，乘客们一致表示：耽误一点时间没有关系，抢救病人要紧。接着，司机就以最快的速度，把公共汽车当作“临时救护车”，一直开到医院门口，售票员还亲自背着乘客到挂号室去挂急诊号。
    售票员们热心地为乘客服务的精神，受到工人和市民的热烈赞扬。从去年1月到现在，公共交通部门已经收到八万多件乘客来信和表扬意见，感谢售票员和司机们对乘客的照顾。（附图片）
