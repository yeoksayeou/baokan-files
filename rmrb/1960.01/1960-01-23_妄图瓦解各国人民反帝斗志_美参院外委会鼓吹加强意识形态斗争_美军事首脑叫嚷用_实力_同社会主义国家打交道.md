Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in a “study report” published on the 17th, wildly suggested that the United States should strengthen the use of ideological weapons to undermine the anti-imperialist fighting spirit of the people of socialist countries and nationally independent countries. This report, entitled "Ideology and Diplomacy," was prepared by the Institute for International Problems at Harvard University at the request of the Foreign Relations Committee. The report includes three parts, discussing nationalism, communism, and so-called "constitutional democracy" respectively.

The report concludes that, in view of "the power of ideology playing a role on the international political stage," U.S. foreign policy must have a so-called "broader vision" to strengthen the wooing and deception of underdeveloped countries and "encourage the evolution within the Soviet system and the communist bloc."

The report actually admits that the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries no longer tolerate their subordinate status. The report said that there is good soil for political movements in these countries, and "the achievement of political movements depends on the extent to which the masses of people support these movements." The report uneasily pointed out that the people of colonial countries, like the people of Asian and African countries that have already achieved national independence, are unwilling to emulate the example of Western capitalist countries when seeking their best political and economic systems, and are increasingly inclined towards socialist ideas. The report shouted that "the Communist Party uses this attitude and presents the Soviet Union as an example of rapid industrial progress." In discussing the situation in Latin America, the report said that "the upper class—traditionally an oligarchy composed of large landowners, big businessmen, capitalists, and senior figures in the church and military" is increasingly being resisted, and its rule "is now under serious threat." The report said, "We Americans had better understand that in the vast public opinion of Latin America, many people loathe us. Many people think that we regard the countries of this region as economic colonies, and that the economic backwardness of Latin America is caused by the commercial interests of the United States." The report said, "Therefore, whenever the Communist Party shouts about American imperialism, even those who are recognized as fiercely anti-communist hate us."

The report greatly exaggerates the ideological foundation of capitalism and the so-called democratic principles of the United States, saying that only by taking "active actions" that "persistently refute" its correctness can the socialist ideology (which the report slanderously calls "arbitrary ideology") "destroy this ideology."

However, the report also cannot hide the fact that it is the actions of the United States itself that undermine the principles of democracy. The report said, "The United States often feels embarrassed whenever one of its allies does not agree to the independence demands of the colonies and insists that the United States support its position. Similar problems often arise when alliances are formed with dictatorial regimes that suppress human rights for security considerations." The report complained that, in this case, concepts that are unfavorable to the United States will naturally be created, thereby "undermining its influence."

In the part about communism, in addition to making a lot of slander, the report had to admit that the achievements and influence of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in developing their economies are difficult for capitalist countries, including the United States, to deal with. The report talked a lot about the necessity of "promoting" the "evolution" within the socialist camp (that is, wishfully trying to degenerate these countries). The report offered the suggestion that "we should promote the widest possible contact with the communist world. Our policy should be to encourage genuine exchanges that are different from formal exchanges." It said, "The United States should strive to develop extensive contacts with intellectuals, and finally with upper and middle-level political figures, in the communist camp in order to gradually influence their thinking and beliefs."

However, despite the report's emphasis on the great significance of ideological struggle, it cannot offer any revitalizing prescriptions for the reactionary bourgeois ideology.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st: Washington News: U.S. senior military leaders recently made a series of belligerent clamors during secret testimonies before some committees of Congress, advocating that the United States accelerate its arms expansion and war preparations, and clamoring to continue to use the "policy of strength" to deal with socialist countries.

U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Twining said when testifying at a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee on military issues last week, "We want to deal from a position of strength. We have tremendous power, both militarily and in our country." Twining clamored that the United States should "continue to maintain" this "tremendous power" of its.

U.S. Secretary of the Army Brucker also advocated in a similarly belligerent manner at a secret meeting of the Senate Military Committee that the United States should continue to implement a "policy of strength" towards socialist countries. He believed that if "without this foundation, no other means of (American) national policy can be truly effective."

Brucker clamored that the U.S. Army's troop ceiling of 870,000 men is the "absolute limit that cannot be reduced any further." He said that the U.S. Army is emphasizing "modernization" and "mobility." He said that the United States is working to build an "air cavalry" unit to carry out "reconnaissance" and "security" missions.

Brucker revealed that the U.S. Army and Air Force will hold a joint exercise to "test" the mobility of the Army's strategic corps and the role that military airlift command can play.

In their testimonies, the U.S. military leaders also tried to conceal the backwardness of the U.S. military strength. Defense Secretary Gates said, "The impression that some people have that the Soviet Union has surpassed or even greatly surpassed the United States in military strength is not supported by facts." However, former U.S. Air Force Secretary and Democratic Senator Symington criticized Eisenhower's budget message in Congress on the 20th, pointing out that the United States is not only no longer the number one military power, but will also gradually decline in economic and technological terms and become a secondary power.

### 妄图瓦解各国人民反帝斗志  美参院外委会鼓吹加强意识形态斗争  美军事首脑叫嚷用“实力”同社会主义国家打交道

    妄图瓦解各国人民反帝斗志
    美参院外委会鼓吹加强意识形态斗争
    美军事首脑叫嚷用“实力”同社会主义国家打交道
    新华社22日讯　美国参议院外交委员会17日发表的一个“研究报告”中狂妄地建议，美国应当加强运用意识形态的武器来瓦解社会主义国家和民族独立国家的人民反对帝国主义的斗志。这个以“意识形态和外交”为题的报告是外交委员会委托哈佛大学国际问题研究所准备的。这个报告包括了三个部分，对民族主义、共产主义和所谓“立宪民主”分别作了论述。
    报告的结论认为，鉴于“在国际政治舞台上发生作用的意识形态的力量”，美国对外政策必须有所谓“更广阔的眼界”，以加强拉拢和欺骗不大发展的国家和“鼓励苏维埃制度和共产党集团内部的演化。”
    报告实际上承认，殖民地和半殖民地国家的人民不再容忍自己的附属地位了。报告说，在这些国家中具有进行政治运动的良好土壤，而“政治运动的成就取决于人民群众支持这些运动的幅度”。报告不安地指出，殖民地国家的人民同亚非已经获得了国家独立的国家的人民一样，在寻找自己最好的政治和经济制度时都不愿仿效西方资本主义国家的榜样，而愈来愈倾向于社会主义的思想。报告叫喊“共产党利用这种态度，并提出苏联作为工业迅速进步的榜样”。报告在谈到拉丁美洲情况时说，“上层阶级——传统上由大地主、大商业家、资本家以及教会和军队上层显贵人物组成的一个寡头集团”正日益遭到反抗，它的统治“现在正受到严重的威胁”。报告说，“我们美国人最好应该了解，在拉丁美洲广大的舆论中，许多人嫌恶我们。许多人认为我们把这个地区的国家视为经济殖民地，认为拉丁美洲经济落后是美国商业利益一手造成的”。报告说，“因此，每当共产党叫喊美帝国主义时，甚至那些被公认为激烈反共的人也都憎恨我们”。
    报告大事吹嘘资本主义的思想基础和所谓美国的民主原则，说什么对社会主义思想（报告诬蔑地称为“专断的思想体系”）“只有采取坚持不懈地驳斥”它的正确性的“积极行动”，“才能摧毁这种思想体系”。
    但是报告也无法掩饰正是美国自己的行动破坏了民主的原则。报告说，“美国每当它的一个盟国不答应殖民地的独立要求并坚持要美国支持它的立场时，往往感到尴尬。而当出于安全的考虑同压制人权的独裁政权缔结同盟时，也往往产生类似的问题”。报告抱怨说，在这种情况下，很自然会造成对美国不利的概念，从而“破坏它的影响”。
    在谈到共产主义的部分中，报告除了大肆诬蔑以外，也不得不承认：苏联和其他社会主义国家在发展经济方面的成就和影响，是资本主义国家，包括美国在内所难以对付的。报告大谈“促进”社会主义阵营内部“演化”（也就是妄想使这些国家蜕变）的必要性。报告献策说，“我们应该促进同共产党世界的尽可能广泛的接触。我们的政策应该是鼓励有别于形式上的来往的真正来往”。他说，“美国应该竭力发展同共产党阵营的知识分子、最后同上层和中层政界人物的广泛接触，以便逐渐影响他们的思想信仰”。
    但是，尽管这个报告十分强调意识形态斗争的重大意义，却对反动的资产阶级思想体系提不出任何起死回生的药方。
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国高级军事首脑最近在国会的一些委员会上秘密作证时，连续发表好战叫嚣，鼓吹美国加速进行扩军备战，叫嚷要继续用“实力地位政策”来对付社会主义国家。
    美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁上星期在众议院拨款委员会讨论军事问题的会议上作证时说，“我们要从实力出发来打交道。我们在军事上以及我们的国家里有着巨大的力量。”特文宁叫嚣说，美国要“继续保持”它的这种“巨大的力量”。
    美国陆军部长布鲁克在参议院军事委员的秘密会上也以同样好战的姿态鼓吹美国继续对社会主义国家执行“实力地位政策”，他认为如果“没有这个基础，（美国）国家政策的其他任何手段都不可能真正有效”。
    布鲁克叫嚷美国陆军八十七万兵员定额是“不能再减少的极限”。他说美国陆军正在强调“现代化”和“机动性”。他说，美国正在努力建设一支“空中轻骑兵”部队，来执行“侦察”和“保安”任务。
    布鲁克透露，美国陆、空军将举行一次联合演习，以“测验”陆军的战略兵团的机动性以及军事空运处可能发挥的作用。
    美国的军事首脑们在作证中还力图掩饰美国军事力量的落后，国防部长盖茨说，“有些人觉得苏联在军事力量方面超过或者甚至大大超过美国，这种印象是得不到事实支持的。”但是，前美国空军部长、民主党参议员薛明顿20日在国会批评艾森豪威尔的预算咨文时指出，美国不仅已经不是第一号的军事强国，而且在经济和技术方面也将逐渐衰退而居于次等地位。
