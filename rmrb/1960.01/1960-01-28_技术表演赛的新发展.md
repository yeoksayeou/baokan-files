Technical performance competitions are a very important new experience on the industrial front in our province, embodying political leadership and large-scale mass movements. Its main characteristics are: the entire staff of enterprises directly competes technically in the form of live performances in daily production activities, learning from each other, helping each other, learning from each other’s strengths, compensating for weaknesses, improving together, constantly mastering technology and innovating technology, creating higher technical and economic quotas, everyone strives to be the best, everyone cares about the excellent achievements of individuals and collectives, and makes every effort to exert the greatest wisdom and energy. Its advantage over other forms of labor competition lies in the on-the-spot performance of skills. Someone performs, someone watches the performance, and there is evaluation. In this way, the people and units participating in the performance must take it seriously, put in solid effort, take out their best skills, and study and research seriously. Not only do they use their hands, but they also use their brains, and make various preparations before the performance. This is the best way to directly combine great effort and improved technology. Therefore, carrying out technical performance competitions can immediately form a large-scale mass movement in enterprises, from leading cadres to workers, engineers, technicians and clerks, from direct production workers to auxiliary workers, from old workers to new workers, from masters to apprentices, etc., all are vigorously involved in the torrent of competition, forming a competitive upsurge of everyone performing, every team performing, and performing everywhere. Through mutual comparison and mutual learning, people catch up with each other, the advanced help the backward, the backward catch up with the advanced, the quick hands lead the slow hands, the slow hands chase the quick hands, the experienced teach the novices, and the novices learn from the experienced, so that the skilled become more proficient and the novices become skilled, enabling the technical level of the majority of workers to be rapidly improved across the board. Technical performance competitions can powerfully promote the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, enabling advanced experiences to emerge in large numbers, production quotas to be broken repeatedly, and many long-term problems and key bottlenecks that could not be solved in the past to be readily solved, and production efficiency to increase several times or dozens of times. Not only that, technical performance competitions can also greatly improve the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act among the workers, the spiritual outlook of the people is constantly changing, and the advanced ranks are rapidly growing. It can be said that technical performance competitions are a new form of labor competition. It conducts practical communist education among the masses, cultivates and promotes the communist spirit of the masses, greatly improves people’s labor consciousness, thereby promoting the close integration of physical labor and mental labor, strengthening the cooperation and coordination in production from front to back and left to right, improving the collective spirit of the masses, enhancing the internal unity of the working class, and enabling the movement to increase production and practice economy to develop continuously and comprehensively.

Technical performance competition was created by the Party organization of the No. 3 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in the course of implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction by boldly mobilizing the masses of workers. Before this plant found the method of technical performance competition in May last year, it was estimated that the annual state plan would be 100,000 tons short of completion. After finding and carrying out technical performance competitions, by the end of the year not only was the state plan completed, but also 100,000 tons of steel was produced for the state. In this way, the No. 3 Steelmaking Plant jumped from a backward new plant to an advanced rank in Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

After the National Day holiday last year, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held a provincial on-site conference in Anshan to summarize the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 3 Steelmaking Plant in carrying out technical performance competitions. The Provincial Party Committee believes that technical performance competitions are a fresh thing with unlimited vitality, giving it a high evaluation, and treating it as the basic form of labor competition in our province and promoting it. The Provincial Party Committee called on all localities and enterprises to promote it by combining it with existing forms of competition in accordance with local conditions, so as to continuously develop and improve it. The experience of technical performance competitions is of universal significance. It is not only applicable to modern enterprises, but also to small and medium-sized enterprises with relatively backward technology; it is not only applicable to industrial production departments, but also to transportation and basic construction departments. In short, it is applicable wherever people are engaged in socialist labor. After the meeting, technical performance competitions swept through large, medium and small enterprises throughout the province on a grand scale, and were warmly welcomed by the majority of workers in the province, forming a large-scale mass movement on the industrial front, which powerfully guaranteed the realization of the great task proposed by the Party Central Committee of opposing right-leaning tendencies, encouraging great effort, and fulfilling and overfulfilling the 1959 production increase and conservation plan ahead of schedule. The province overfulfilled the annual state plan by 10.5% by the end of last year; and on this basis, strode into 1960 with its head held high, winning an all-round good start. The current industrial situation is better than ever in the history of our province.

The experience of technical performance competitions has not only taken root and blossomed in industrial and mining enterprises, transportation enterprises and basic construction units throughout the province, but has also been vigorously carried out in stores, service industries and other departments. Through the practice and creative application of the broad masses of workers in the province, the content is now more rich, colorful and complete.

Large-Scale Joint Technical Performance Competitions

Technical performance competitions have generally developed from individual, single-item performance competitions and group performance competitions to large-scale joint technical performance competitions organized by all relevant departments of the entire factory and mine with products as the goal. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel Company launched a large-scale joint technical performance competition with more than 100,000 workers participating throughout the company, with the goal of ensuring the overproduction of 300,000 tons of steel. The characteristics of this large-scale joint technical performance competition are: (1) It has a unified and clear goal, unified leadership, concentrated strength, and consistent steps; (2) The movement is fierce, the morale of the masses is high, from leaders at all levels to all employees, everyone is on the front line, and even workers who cook, fetch water, and watch bicycles participate in the technical performance competition; (3) Under one goal, all links are driven, and even backward units and weak links are driven to make great strides forward, support each other, promote each other, and cooperate closely; (4) The scale is large, the momentum is large, the energy is great, and the effect is great, ensuring a comprehensive and large-scale harvest; (5) It is a big "earthquake" for those who do not believe in the leadership of the Party Committee, political command, and large-scale mass movements, and they also shout "Now the work is easier to do."

Large-scale joint technical performance competitions are the inevitable trend and result of the development of individual, single-item technical performance competitions. Because modern industrial enterprises are interlocked, various departments, workshops, and processes must have unified and coordinated actions to ensure the leap forward in the production of the entire enterprise. Otherwise, even if a certain process or a certain group, section, or workshop increases production efficiency several times through technical performance competitions, if other processes, groups, sections, and workshops do not keep up at the same time, the overall production level of the entire factory cannot be rapidly and comprehensively improved. Large-scale joint technical performance competitions are fully adapted to this characteristic of modern enterprise production. It promotes the unified action and close cooperation of various links of the enterprise around one goal, ensuring a comprehensive leap forward in production.

Large-scale joint technical performance competitions are developed on the basis of individual, single-item technical performance competitions. It not only does not exclude individual, single-item technical performance competitions, but also must give full play to the role of individual, single-item technical performance competitions in large-scale joint technical performance competitions. Large-scale joint technical performance competitions and other existing forms of labor competition (such as the "one-dragon" large-scale cooperation competition between different types of work organized according to the production process around a certain product, or the opponent competition and counterpart competition organized by the same type of work and the same type of factories and mines) are not only not mutually exclusive, but also closely integrated with the original forms of labor competition. At present, there are various forms of labor competition in enterprises. Large-scale joint technical performance competitions include not only the original individual, single-item technical performance competitions, but also the "one-dragon" communist large-scale cooperation competition and opponent competition and other labor competitions, so it is the basic form of labor competition.

Technical Performance "Games"

Technical performance competitions have developed into the form of technical performance "games" in some enterprises.

The form of this performance competition takes the daily plan as the goal, and competes in whatever is done. The form of the performance "games" is diverse, and people in different work positions participate in various forms of competition. After the competition every day, according to the quality of each group and each employee's completion of the task on that day, the "referees" selected by the masses and the employees will evaluate together. The units that win the competition will be given the glorious titles of collective champion, runner-up, and third place; the individuals who win the competition will be given the titles of individual champion, runner-up, third place, grade "athlete," grade athlete, and all-around "athlete," and some will be promoted to referees. After the evaluation work is completed every night, the competition items for the next day (daily production plan) are immediately announced, and everyone is organized to discuss, arrange the items of the performance "games," and do all the preparatory work, repeatedly and continuously conducting the performance "games" day after day. Some units also organize an "elite athlete selection competition" at a certain period, and hold a "triathlon competition" every month to promote the continuous improvement of technology and the development into multi-skilled workers among the majority of workers.

In addition to the advantages of general technical performance competitions, this technical performance competition also has the following characteristics: (1) Because the technical performance "games" itself requires each "athlete" to pay attention to tactics and achieve high speed in the competition, it promotes the "athlete" to consciously engage in clever work, innovate technology, learn from the advanced, strive to surpass the advanced, and break new records. In addition, each "athlete" must go through a process of hard study and hard training to develop into a grade "athlete," athlete, referee, and instructor. Every promotion and breaking of a new record greatly encourages the "athlete's" ambition, which can prompt each employee to always exert the spirit of being tireless in the competition process and give full play to infinite wisdom, so that the joint technical performance competition will rise higher and higher and continue to be carried out regularly. (2) From the perspective of the form of the technical performance "games," it is novel, rich and colorful, and inspiring, which can constantly inspire the masses to new efforts and put them into the competition movement. (3) The most important thing about the "games" is to take the daily plan as the outline, closely combine with production, set production, timing, staffing, and methods, and highly organize the daily production activities of employees.

Matching of Advanced Experiences

Technical performance competitions already have a complete form of continuous development and consolidation and improvement. This is: performance - matching - promotion, then performance - then matching - then promotion...

What is matching? Matching is to comprehensively analyze the large amount of experience created by employees in technical performance competitions, match them into a relatively complete set of advanced experience, and incorporate them into the process regulations after technical appraisal. Matching includes "horizontal matching" and "sequential matching." "Horizontal matching" is to summarize and summarize the different operating experiences and achievements of technological innovation of the same process of the same product to form a relatively complete set of experience. "Sequential matching" is to summarize the experience according to the technological process of a product to form a relatively complete set of experience. Now some factories, in addition to "horizontal matching" and "sequential matching," also carry out advanced experience matching on a large scale according to product series. As a result of large-scale matching, the process regulations are more complete, more practical, and more advanced. Using the matching method to comprehensively summarize many fragmented and scattered experiences, after analysis and research, eliminate the dross and retain the essence, and match them into a relatively complete systematic experience, these experiences have played a role that they could not play when they existed alone. For example, a lathe group of the 53 Factory used to produce an average of 270 light pole screws per person per day. After Yang Jingshan summarized the "three quicks" of "quick clamping," "quick tool post rotation," and "quick cutting" in the technical performance competition, the output increased to 480; Zhu Guiren summarized the experience of "clamping the bias surface" and "eating large tools," and increased it to 500; Ren Zhixue matched their two methods and applied them as a set, increasing it to 550; Later, the experience of Li Zhongwu and Ren Zhixue in using "reverse tool post" and "locator" was absorbed, and it was increased to 800. In this way, after the technological innovation of four people successively, seven experiences were matched into a set, and the production efficiency was 1.96 times higher than the original, and much higher than the efficiency of each single experience. Matching also has a role, that is, through "sequential matching," the weak links in production can also be discovered, because a process does not have advanced experience, so it cannot be matched into a set; so a technical performance competition is organized in this process, so that the weak links quickly catch up with the advanced links, promote the overall leap forward in production, and at the same time make the experience matched into a set.

After the experience is matched, it must be vigorously promoted and mastered by the majority of workers in order to rapidly improve the level of production technology. In addition to using the existing various methods to organize the promotion of advanced experience, "advanced experience promotion teams" and "production leap forward mutual aid teams" are also formed by cadres, advanced producers, veteran workers, and engineers and technicians. This is a good form of organized, planned, targeted, and specific help for ordinary producers to learn and master advanced experience, improve technology, and improve ideological awareness. The "Production Leap Forward Mutual Aid Team" generally ranks the skills of employees, and then determines the object of assistance, and adopts the method of contracting by division of labor, "one key opens one lock" and "two lead two help" to provide specific assistance. "Two leads" means taking the lead in technical performance and driving the assisted to participate in technical performance competitions; "Two help" means helping to improve technology and helping to improve ideological awareness. Because the "Production Leap Forward Mutual Aid Team" has this communist spirit, it is deeply welcomed by the masses. It has played a great role in helping ordinary producers master technology and improve their awareness. According to statistics from 139 units in Shenyang City, 2,099 mutual aid teams of various types were organized, with more than 20,000 team members, which enabled 20,363 people to reach and break the quota from failing to complete the quota, and enabled 10,273 people to catch up with the level of advanced production workers. After the industrial system in Shenyang City promoted the matching of advanced experience, more than 380,000 person-times increased production efficiency by half to ten times, and more than 680 people increased it by eleven times, which played an important role in the city's completion of the 1959 industrial total output value plan one month ahead of schedule. After the experience is matched, some are used as cultural textbooks, teaching literacy while explaining experience. Some are also compiled into poems and quick-board books. For example, the workers of the Dashiqiao Magnesium Mine compiled the experience of ensuring the quality of brick pushing into a song formula of "calipers on both ends bring the middle, drums in the heart, fingertips, gently put down without touching the edge." These song formulas are easy for workers to learn and remember, and are very popular. Three-Level One-Dragon Business Performance Competition

Functional departments have widely carried out the "three-level one-dragon business performance competition in offices, workshops, and teams," which has greatly strengthened enterprise management and changed the face of office work. The "three-level one-dragon business performance competition" means that business personnel in factories, workshops, and teams, according to business systems such as planning, scheduling, economic accounting, material supply, technology and safety, equipment maintenance, process equipment, quality inspection, and personnel attendance, connect up and down, string into one dragon, and carry out a business performance competition centered on improving enterprise management. The "three-level one-dragon business performance competition" has made office work truly rely on the masses, combine the top and bottom, go deep into production and serve production, changing the past practice of never being able to get out of the office, jumping out of the small circle of a few people engaged in enterprise management, or abandoning business after going to the workshop and simply participating in labor. At the same time, it has also changed the relationship between offices, cooperating with each other in case of trouble, taking the initiative to support, overcoming the phenomenon of constant wrangling and shirking responsibility, and the efficiency and quality of work have been significantly improved, gradually changing the situation that office work is often the backward link in mass movements, making professional management and worker participation in management closely combined. Professional departments take the initiative to "link up" with worker business personnel, help them establish business, improve work, and conduct business training, etc., thereby improving the level of worker participation in management and giving full play to the role of the majority of workers in participating in management. Facts have proved that the "three-level one-dragon business performance competition" has found an important experience for office work, carrying out mass movements on a large scale, following the mass line, improving enterprise management and improving management level.

Technical performance competition is still a new thing. New things are always opposed by old, conservative things and right-leaning ideas when they first grow out. Therefore, the process of promoting technical performance competitions is a process of constantly criticizing right-leaning ideas. The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China basically solved this problem at the provincial on-site conference held in Anshan in October last year. In the process of promotion, technical performance competition itself has shown its great superiority, and with the strong support of Party organizations at all levels, it is not only constantly overcoming obstacles on the road forward, but also has grown rapidly. Now, in the production of 1960, it is playing a full vitality, closely combining various existing other forms of competition, and integrating various new experiences that are constantly emerging among the workers, galloping forward. The more than 2 million industrial army in our province, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, holding high the red banner of the general line, are full of confidence and striving for a continued great leap forward in 1960. All employees must vigorously carry out technical performance competitions, ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state plan ahead of schedule, and strive for red every day, red every month, red every quarter, and a full house of red throughout the year.

    技术表演赛的新发展
    中共辽宁省委书记　杨春甫
    技术表演赛是我省工业战线上政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的一个极为重要的新经验。它的主要特征是：企业的全体职工在日常生产活动中以现场表演的形式，直接比赛技术，互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，共同提高，不断地掌握技术和革新技术，创造更高的技术经济定额，人人都争上游，人人都关心个人和集体的优越成绩，千方百计地发挥最大智慧和干劲。它比别的劳动竞赛形式优越之处，就在实地表演技术上。有人表演，有人看表演，而且要评比。这样，参加表演的人和单位就得郑重其事，踏踏实实地拿出绝招，认真学习和钻研，不仅动手，而且要开动脑筋，表演前就得作好各种准备。这是鼓足干劲和提高技术直接结合起来的最好形式。所以，开展技术表演赛就可以使企业立刻形成大规模的群众运动，从领导干部到工人、工程技术人员和职员，从直接生产工人到辅助工人，从老工人到新工人，从师傅到徒弟等等，都如火如荼地卷进竞赛的洪流中去，形成人人表演，班班表演，处处表演的竞赛热潮。职工们通过互比互学，你追我赶，先进帮后进，后进赶先进，快手带慢手，慢手追快手，老手教新手，新手学老手，就会使熟手更娴熟，生手变熟手，使广大职工的技术水平普遍地迅速提高。技术表演赛可以有力地促进技术革新和技术革命运动，使先进经验大量出现，生产定额一再突破，平时许多长期解决不了的老问题、老关键迎刃而解，生产效率几倍、几十倍地增长。不仅如此，技术表演赛还可以使职工们敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格大大提高，人们的精神面貌不断地发生变化，先进队伍迅速壮大。可以说，技术表演赛是一种劳动竞赛的新形式。它对群众进行了实际的共产主义教育，培养和发扬了群众的共产主义精神，大大提高了人们的劳动自觉性，从而促进了体力劳动与脑力劳动的密切结合，加强了生产中前后左右的协作配合，提高群众的集体主义思想，增强工人阶级内部团结，使增产节约运动持续全面地向前发展。
    技术表演赛是鞍山钢铁公司第三炼钢厂党组织在贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线当中，放手发动职工群众所创造的。这个厂在去年5月间还没有找到技术表演赛的方法以前，估计全年国家计划将有十万吨完不成。找到而且开展了技术表演赛以后，到年底不但完成了国家计划，而且为国家增产了十万吨钢。这样，第三炼钢厂就由一个落后的新厂，一跃而在鞍山钢铁公司中居于先进的行列。
    去年国庆节后，中共辽宁省委在鞍山召开了全省现场会议，总结了鞍钢第三炼钢厂开展技术表演赛的经验。省委认为技术表演赛是一个具有无限生命力的新鲜事物，给以很高的估价，把它当作我省当前劳动竞赛的基本形式加以推广。省委号召各地各企业因地制宜地把它和已有的各种竞赛形式结合起来推广，使之不断地发展和日臻完善。技术表演赛的经验是具有普遍意义的，它不仅适用于现代化的企业，而且也适用于技术比较落后的中小企业；不仅适用于工业生产部门，而且也适用于交通运输和基本建设部门。总之，凡是有人从事社会主义劳动的地方，都是适用的。会后，技术表演赛就波澜壮阔地席卷全省的大中小企业，受到了全省广大职工的热烈欢迎，形成了工业战线上的大规模的群众运动，这就有力地保证了党中央提出的反右倾、鼓干劲，提前超额完成1959年增产节约计划这一伟大任务的实现。全省到去年年底超额10．5％完成了全年国家计划；并在这个基础上，昂首阔步地踏入了1960年，夺得全线开门红。当前工业形势之好，在我省历史上是空前的。
    技术表演赛的经验不仅在全省工矿企业、交通运输企业和基本建设单位普遍地开花结果，而且也在商店、服务行业等部门热火朝天地展开了。经过全省广大职工群众的实践和创造性的运用，到现在内容是更加丰富多彩和完整了。
    大联合技术表演赛
    技术表演赛已经普遍由单人、单项表演赛和小组表演赛发展到以产品为目标，组织整个厂矿各有关部门的大联合技术表演赛。像鞍山钢铁公司以保证超额生产三十万吨钢为目标，在全公司范围内开展了有十几万职工参加的大联合技术表演赛。这种大联合技术表演赛的特点是：（一）有统一的明确的目标，领导统一、力量集中、步调一致；（二）运动来势猛烈，群众斗志昂扬，从各级领导人员到全体职工，都一齐上前线，做饭、打水、看自行车的工人也都参加技术表演赛；（三）在一个目标下面，把所有环节都带动起来，甚至落后单位和薄弱环节也都被带动起来大踏步前进，互相支援，互相促进，密切协作；（四）规模大、声势大、劲头大、效果大，保证全面的大面积丰收；（五）对不相信党委领导、政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的人是一个大“地震”，他们也呼喊“这下工作好做了”。
    大联合技术表演赛是单人、单项技术表演赛发展的必然趋势和必然结果。因为现代化工业企业，环环相扣，各个部门、车间、工序之间必须有统一的协同动作，才能保证整个企业生产的跃进。否则，尽管某道工序或者某个小组、工段、车间通过技术表演赛生产效率成倍增长，而其它工序、小组、工段和车间没有同时跟上来，全厂的生产水平也不能迅速全面提高。大联合技术表演赛完全适应了现代化企业生产的这种特点。它促进了企业各个环节围绕一个目标，统一行动，密切协作，保证生产的全面大跃进。
    大联合技术表演赛是在单人、单项技术表演赛的基础上发展起来的。它不仅不排斥单人、单项的技术表演赛，而且在大联合技术表演赛当中，还必须充分发挥单人、单项技术表演赛的作用。大联合技术表演赛和原有的其它各种劳动竞赛形式（如围绕着某种产品，按照生产过程组织起来的不同工种之间的“一条龙”大协作赛，或者同工种、同类型厂矿组织起来的对手赛、对口赛等）不仅不互相排斥，而且是与原有劳动竞赛形式密切结合的。当前企业中的劳动竞赛形式是多种多样的。大联合技术表演赛既有原来的单人、单项技术表演赛，又有“一条龙”共产主义大协作赛和对手赛等劳动竞赛，所以，它是劳动竞赛的基本形式。
    技术表演“运动会”
    技术表演赛在有些企业发展成为技术表演“运动会”的形式。
    这种表演赛的形式以日计划为目标，做什么就赛什么。表演“运动会”的形式多种多样，不同工作岗位上的人参加各种不同形式的竞赛。每天比赛结束后，根据每个组和每个职工当天完成任务的好坏，由群众选出的“裁判员”和职工一起评议。获得竞赛优胜的单位，给予集体冠军、亚军、殿军光荣称号；个人获得竞赛优胜者，分别给予个人冠军、亚军、殿军、等级“运动员”、等级健将、全能“运动员”等称号，有的晋级为裁判员。每天晚上评比工作结束以后，就马上宣布第二天比赛项目（生产日计划），并组织大家讨论，安排好表演“运动会”的项目，做好一切准备工作，往复循环，日复一日地不断地进行表演“运动会”。 有的单位在一定时期，还组织一次优秀运动员“选拔赛”，每月搞一次“三项全能赛”，促使广大职工不断提高技术和发展成多面手。
    这种技术表演赛，除了具备一般的技术表演赛的优点以外，还有以下特点：（一）由于技术表演“运动会”本身要求每个“运动员”在比赛中，要讲究战术，达到高速度，从而促使“运动员”自觉地进行巧干，革新技术，向先进学习，力求超过先进，打破新纪录。加以每个“运动员”发展成为等级“运动员”、健将、裁判员、指导，都必须经过苦学苦练的过程。每晋一级和打破一项新纪录，都大大鼓舞着“运动员”的上进心，可以促使每个职工在竞赛过程中，始终鼓足百战不厌的干劲和发挥无穷的智慧，从而使联合技术表演赛一浪高一浪，经常持久地开展下去。（二）从技术表演“运动会”形式来看，既新颖、丰富多彩，又振奋人心，可以使群众不断鼓起新的干劲，投入到竞赛运动中去。（三）“运动会”最重要的是以日计划为纲，紧紧结合生产，定产、定时、定员、定方法，把职工的日常生产活动，高度地组织在一起。
    先进经验配套
    技术表演赛已经有了一套向前不断发展和巩固提高的完整形式。这就是：表演——配套——推广，再表演——再配套——再推广……。
    什么叫做配套呢？配套就是将职工在技术表演赛中创造的大量经验，经过综合分析，搭配成一套比较完整的先进经验，经过技术鉴定纳入工艺规程。配套有“横配”和“顺配”。“横配”就是把同一产品的同一工序的不同操作经验和革新技术的成果总结归纳起来，形成一套比较完整的经验。“顺配”就是按照一个产品的工艺过程把经验归纳起来，形成一套比较完整的经验。现在有的工厂除了“横配”和“顺配”而外，还按照产品系列，大搞先进经验配套。大搞配套的结果，工艺规程更加健全完整，更加切合实际，也更加先进。运用配套方法，把许多零碎、分散的经验综合归纳起来，经过分析研究，去粗存精，配成比较完整的系统的经验，这些经验发挥了它单独存在时所不能发挥的作用。比如，五三工厂的一个车工小组过去车光杆螺丝平均每人每天生产二百七十个，杨景山在技术表演赛中总结出“卡活快”、“转刀台快”和“切活快”的“三活快”以后，产量提高到四百八十个；朱贵仁总结了“卡偏面”和“吃大刀”的经验后，提高到五百个；任志学把他们两个人的方法配成一套运用，提高到五百五十个；以后又吸收了李忠武、任志学的使用“反刀台”和“定位器”的经验，提高到八百个。这样先后经过四个人的革新技术，将七项经验配成一套，生产效率就比原来提高了一点九六倍，比每个单项经验的效率都大为提高。配套还有一个作用，就是通过“顺配”，还可以发现生产中的薄弱环节，因为一道工序没有先进经验，就不能配成一套；于是就在这道工序组织技术表演赛，使薄弱环节迅速赶上先进环节，促进生产的全面跃进，同时也就使经验搭配成套。
    经验配套之后，要大力推广，为广大职工所掌握，才能迅速提高生产技术水平。组织推广先进经验，除运用了已有的各种方法以外，还由干部、先进生产者、老工人和工程技术人员组成“先进经验推广队”、“生产跃进互助队”。这是一种有组织、有计划、有目标、有具体对象的帮助普通生产者学习和掌握先进经验、提高技术、提高思想觉悟的良好形式。“生产跃进互助队”一般都对职工的技术进行排队，然后确定帮助对象，采取分工包干，“一把钥匙开一把锁”和“两带两帮”的办法进行具体帮助。“两带”即带头进行技术表演，带动被帮助者参加技术表演赛；“两帮”即帮助提高技术，帮助提高思想觉悟。由于“生产跃进互助队”具有这种共产主义精神，因此，深受群众欢迎。它在帮助普通生产者掌握技术、提高觉悟方面起了极大作用。据沈阳市一百三十九个单位统计，组织了各种互助队二千零九十九个，队员两万多人，使二万零三百六十三人由完不成定额而达到和突破定额，使一万零二百七十三人赶上了先进生产工人的水平。沈阳市工业系统在推广先进经验配套之后，就有三十八万多人次提高生产效率半倍到十倍，提高十一倍的六百八十多人，对全市提前一个月完成1959年工业总产值计划起了重要作用。经验配套之后，有的当做文化课本，一面教识字，一面讲经验。也有的编成诗歌、快板，例如大石桥镁矿工人就把保证推砖质量的经验编成了“两头卡尺带中间，鼓手心，用手尖，轻放不碰边”的歌诀。这些歌诀，工人易学易记，大受欢迎。三级一条龙同业务表演赛
    职能部门广泛地开展了“科室、车间、小组三级一条龙同业务表演赛”，大大地加强了企业管理工作，改变了科室工作的面貌。“三级一条龙同业务表演赛”，就是厂、车间、小组中的业务人员按照计划、调度、经济核算、材料供应、技术安全、设备维修、工艺装备、质量检查、人事考勤等业务系统，上下对口，串成一条龙，开展以改进企业管理为中心的同业务表演赛。“三级一条龙同业务表演赛”，使科室工作真正做到了依靠群众，上下结合，深入生产、为生产服务，改变了过去那种总也走不出办公室、跳不出少数人搞企业管理的狭小圈子，或下车间后丢掉业务，单纯参加劳动的做法。同时，也改变了科室之间的关系，有事互相协作，主动支援，克服了经常扯皮、推诿责任的现象，工作效率和工作质量都有显著提高，逐渐改变了科室工作经常是群众运动的落后环节的局面，使专业管理和工人参加管理密切结合起来。专业部门主动与工人业务员“挂钩”，帮助他们建立业务，改进工作，并进行业务训练等等，从而提高了工人参加管理工作的水平，发挥了广大工人参加管理的作用。事实证明，“三级一条龙同业务表演赛”为科室工作，大搞群众运动、走群众路线、改进企业管理工作和提高管理水平，找到了一条重要经验。
    技术表演赛还是一件新生事物。新生的东西刚生长出来的时候，总是要受到旧的、保守的东西和右倾思想的反对。因此，推广技术表演赛的过程就是不断批判右倾思想的过程。中共辽宁省委去年10月在鞍山召开的全省现场会议，已经把这个问题基本上解决了。在推行过程中，技术表演赛本身显示了它的巨大优越性，加以各级党组织的大力支持，不仅不断地在克服着前进道路上的障碍，而且已经很快地壮大起来了。现在，在1960年的生产中，它正发挥着充沛的活力，把各种已有的其他竞赛形式紧密地结合起来，把职工中不断涌现的各种新的经验都溶合起来，奔腾前进。我省二百多万产业大军，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，高举总路线的红旗，信心百倍地争取1960年继续大跃进。全体职工要大搞技术表演赛，保证提前超额完成国家计划，为日日红，月月红，季季红，全年满堂红而奋斗。
