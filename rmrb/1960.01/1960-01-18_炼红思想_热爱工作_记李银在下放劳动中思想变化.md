Refining Thought, Loving Work
    ——An Account of Li Yin's Ideological Transformation During Downward Transfer Labor
    By Our Correspondent Feng Dongshu

Li Yin has become a "popular figure" in the Majiayao Management Area of the Beijing Commune. Whenever the commune members mention him, they start chatting excitedly, both laughing and praising. They laugh at his occasional stubbornness, and praise him as a good cadre of Chairman Mao. Everyone talks so warmly and naturally, as if Li Yin were their own child, their own brother. Ma Dianxiang, the secretary of the Majiayao Management Area Party Branch, said to me: "Cadres like Li Yin have not disappointed the Party's hopes. After a year of labor training, listen to what the masses say, they feel he is one with them."

        Ideological Ailments

Speaking of Li Yin's original identity, there's a story behind it. Many comrades who used to work with him in the county have always been unclear about his specific job. Whenever someone asked him where he worked, Li Yin would always answer vaguely: "The County People's Committee," or at most, "The County Agricultural Construction Bureau." In fact, after graduating from Ningwu Animal Husbandry School in 1955, he had been working in the animal husbandry section of the Yuncheng County Agricultural Construction Bureau in Shanxi Province. He knew how to treat sick livestock and how to do artificial insemination. Although he studied this line, he always felt that working in it was not dignified. Therefore, he was always reluctant to tell people what he did. He initially studied animal husbandry not because he had a correct understanding of it, but because he lacked the conditions to apply to other schools at the time. After graduation, he paid even more attention to pursuing material enjoyment, his hair shiny with oil, his leather shoes polished. In this way, he felt even more that receiving cattle, donkeys, and mules all day long was not commensurate with his status, it was truly dirty and without a future. Especially once, when his wife also expressed dissatisfaction with his work, he regretted even more that he had chosen this job. One Saturday afternoon, he was dressed neatly, ready to meet his wife. Unfortunately, a farmer led a sick cow in, asking him to treat it. Just at that critical moment, Li Yin heard someone call him a veterinarian, and he became angry: "Who's the veterinarian? Go, go, go!" Saying that, he drove the person away. From then on, he was determined to change his profession and asked the Party Branch Secretary about this request. The Party Branch Secretary explained many reasons to him and said, "Every profession is revolutionary work, it's a social division of labor, if you don't do it, who will?" Although the Branch Secretary's words enlightened him, they did not fundamentally solve the problem. Four years passed, and his thoughts were still in conflict. Although he still did his work, as he himself said, he had a problem in his heart.

Chen's Elderly Words

Last March, Li Yin and more than twenty other comrades were sent down to Majiayao for labor training. As soon as they arrived, they encountered the booming spring plowing manure-spreading campaign, and all the people in the district, old and young, were busy preparing for spring plowing. Seeing the commune members' great enthusiasm, the sent-down cadres decided, in addition to working with the commune members, to plant three mu of high-yield experimental fields, planning to apply 160,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. With so much fertilizer, how could it be transported to the fields? Rely on livestock? But there have always been more land and fewer livestock, and after communization, the various construction projects were developing rapidly, and the development of livestock could not keep up for a while. The commune members had to rely on carrying poles to send manure to the fields, so how could that work? Several young men discussed it and decided that since they couldn't rely on livestock, they would use the carts when they were empty, and people would pull the carts to send manure to the fields. Li Yin was the strongest, nicknamed Zhao Zilong, and volunteered to pull the cart. In this way, eight young men pushing and pulling started working. For the first two days, it didn't seem too bad. On the third day, every time they pulled to the bottom of the slope of the experimental field, Li Yin became worried. Looking at everyone and thinking about himself, he was really tired. He thought: If there were livestock at this time, even a small donkey, that would be great. That day, although he knew that there were no livestock at home in each team, he still held on to a glimmer of hope and went to the breeding farm. There, besides seeing three sick cattle, he saw the anxious face of the breeder who couldn't find a veterinarian.

From the time Li Yin entered animal husbandry school to the time he was sent down, he had heard the importance of livestock thousands of times, but he had never had such a deep feeling for livestock as at this time. In those days, he repeatedly thought: Rural animal husbandry work really should be done well. But who would do it? Thinking of this, he seemed to hear the headmaster's parting words when he graduated four years ago: "You must remember that you are animal husbandry cadres trained by the Party and the people, do not disappoint the Party and the people's expectations of you." At that time, he didn't think these words had any weight, but when he thought about them at this time, they sounded resounding. He couldn't sleep well for several nights, and as soon as he closed his eyes, he remembered the embarrassed appearance of pulling the cart, the breeder's anxious face, his past work attitude... He finally thought that if everyone was like himself, when would the face of the countryside change?

In those days, it just so happened that a yellow cow in the fourth production team had tympanites and was on the verge of death. After hearing this news, Li Yin immediately found some tobacco leaves and half a jin of sesame oil without hesitation, mixed them together, and poured them into the cow. After two hours of first aid, the cow was out of danger. As soon as the matter was over, it suddenly occurred to him: Now the masses know that he is a veterinarian, and they will definitely look down on him. The fact was just the opposite, the masses were not laughing at him, but discussing sending him a congratulatory message, and some even asked to send him a plaque. At this time, Li Yin began to feel ashamed, but he still had a knot in his heart. In the evening, when he met old man Chen Jiansan, he tentatively asked again: "Uncle San, what do you think of our line of work?" Old man Chen said: "That depends on who is saying it. Landlords, rich peasants, and young masters don't do this, they think it's useless. We farmers don't think so. Without livestock, what can you accomplish!" That night, Li Yin didn't sleep well again. He felt that Chen Jiansan's words were very correct, sharp, and weighty. He felt a little scared in his heart. He didn't expect that he had such a serious problem in his thinking. At this time, he realized that his past thinking had been running counter to the masses.

Veterinarian, Inseminator, Breeder

Li Yin began to love the profession of veterinarian and actively took action. Soon, he helped the Majiayao Management Area establish a simple veterinary station. Not long after, Li Yin found that many of the management area's female animals were not pregnant. Just treating diseases could not fundamentally solve the problem of insufficient animal power. He thought: Why not be an inseminator myself? But he immediately denied this idea. Because he heard that there was an old custom in this area that says inseminators have unclean hands, and if he became an inseminator, wouldn't he be laughed at by the villagers! But how could he ignore what happened? His thoughts were conflicted again.

One day, the white horse in the sideline industry group was in heat, and a stud donkey was tied next to it; but no one in the village knew how to inseminate, and there was no time to go to the insemination station, and the sideline industry leader was in a hurry. Li Yin wanted to do it, but he was ashamed. He wanted to go over several times, but retreated. Finally, when he thought of how much the Great Leap Forward needed livestock; remembered that some old grandmothers quietly put buns on his pillow because he was a veterinarian and had done things for everyone; and thought of the few heart-stopping words Chen Jiansan had said to him, he felt he couldn't hesitate any longer. So, he immediately led the stud donkey to inseminate the white horse. The stud donkey was short, so he carried a shoulder on the donkey's butt. While doing it, he thought: The masses didn't laugh at him last time, but this time it's inevitable. As soon as he finished, his face was flushed. But the result was the same as last time, no one laughed at him. Commune member Uncle Ma said: "The Communist Party's cadres are all the same, they are all good cadres. As long as it's beneficial to us ordinary people, they'll do anything!"

This was the first time in his life that he had heard the masses associate himself with the great Communist Party. He thought: Is he a good cadre of the Communist Party? Does he do everything that is beneficial to the masses? Thinking of this, he was truly ashamed. He immediately went to the Party Branch Secretary, excitedly poured out everything in his heart, and promised that he must be a truly good cadre in the future. He asked for the stud donkey to be given to him so that he could be an inseminator and breeder. The Party Branch Secretary shook his hand tightly and said kindly: "That's great, the Party needs cadres like you! The People's Commune needs cadres like you!" Li Yin heard this, and suddenly felt a warm current flowing through his whole body, and he was so excited that he couldn't speak.

          Livestock Sanatorium

From then on, Li Yin moved to live in the breeding farm. In addition to feeding the stud donkey and a stud bull, he also treated sick livestock. When the livestock of any team was sick and could not be cured for a while, he would leave the livestock here, treating and feeding them at the same time. Sometimes, he would stay up all night guarding the sick livestock. Once, a cow was very sick and the weather was cold, so he put his quilt on the cow. Some cows had sores, and he always washed them patiently until they were healed. Some old cows that were more than twenty years old, thin and weak, were able to participate in production again after Li Yin's careful recuperation. Therefore, the masses called this livestock pen a "livestock sanatorium."

In addition, he also established files for all the livestock in the management area and put forward more than thirty rationalization proposals for animal husbandry work. He actively learned from the old breeders, helped them summarize their experiences, and imparted scientific knowledge, so that the sick livestock in Majiayao were greatly reduced, and the phenomenon of non-pregnancy was also greatly reduced. At present, only a few of the management area's eligible female animals are not pregnant. It is estimated that the area will increase more than fifty young animals this year.

Currently, Li Yin is actively teaching technology so that it will not affect Majiayao's animal husbandry work after he returns to the office in the future. At the same time, he is also actively collecting the masses' experiences in livestock feeding, management, use, breeding, hygiene, and other aspects to enrich himself. He said: "When you really plan to contribute to the animal husbandry cause, you will find that your business level is still far from enough."

Now, Li Yin has moved to live in the breeding farm. In addition to feeding the stud donkey and a stud bull, he also treats sick livestock. Zhao Zhifang Illustration

    炼红思想  热爱工作
    ——记李银在下放劳动中思想变化 
    本报记者　冯东书
    李银，成了北景公社马家窑管理区的“红人”。社员一提起他，就像打开了话匣子，又是笑又是夸。笑他有时有股楞劲，夸他是毛主席的好干部。大家谈得那么亲切，那么自然，好像李银就是他们自己的孩子，自己的兄弟。马家窑管理区党支部书记马殿祥对我说：“像李银这样的干部，没有辜负党的希望。经过一年劳动锻炼，你听听，群众觉得他和自己一条心了。”
        思想上的病症
    提起李银原来的身份，这里面有个故事。许多过去和他一起在县里工作的同志，都一直弄不清他的具体工作。一碰到有人问他在哪里工作时，李银总是含含糊糊地回答：“县人民委员会”，顶多是“县农建局”。其实，1955年他从宁武畜牧专业学校毕业后，就一直在山西省运城县农业建设局畜牧股工作。他会给牲口看病，又会配种。他虽然学的是这一行，可总觉得干这一行不体面。所以，他总不愿公开对人说自己是干什么的。他当初学畜牧，并不是因为对它有正确的认识，只是因为当时缺乏投考别的学校的条件。毕业以后，他又很注意追求物质上的享受，头发油光，皮鞋黑亮。这样一来，他越发觉得一天接待牛驴骡马，和自己的身份不相称，真是又脏又没出息。特别是有一次，他的爱人也对他这行工作表示不太称心。他更后悔当初不该选择这项工作。一个星期六的下午，他刚穿得整整齐齐的，准备去会爱人。不巧一个农民牵着一头病牛走进门来，请他诊治。正当这骨节眼上，李银听见有人叫他兽医，就发火了：“谁是兽医，走，走，走！”说着，便把人家轰走了。从此，他决心改行。并找党支部书记，提出了这一要求。党支部书记给他讲了很多道理，并对他说：“哪一行都是革命工作，这是社会分工，你不干谁来干呢？”支部书记的话，对他虽有启发，但没有根本解决问题。四个年头过去了，他的思想却一直在矛盾中。工作虽然也作了，但正如他自己所说的，心里是有病的。陈老大爷的话
    去年3月，李银和其他二十几位同志一起，下放到马家窑劳动锻炼。一下来，就遇上了轰轰烈烈的春耕送粪运动，全区老老少少都为准备春耕忙碌着。看到社员这么大的干劲，下放干部决定除了和社员一起干活以外，再种三亩高额丰产试验田，计划每亩施肥十六万斤。这么多肥料，怎样往地里运呢？靠牲口吧，可是这里从来是地多牲口少，再加上公社化后，各方面的建设事业都在迅速发展，牲口的发展一时赶不上，社员往地里送粪，还得靠肩挑，那怎么能行呢？几个小伙子一商议，靠牲口没指望，决定利用大车空的时候，人拉大车往地里送粪。李银身体最壮，号称赵子龙，自告奋勇驾辕。就这样，八个小伙子推的推，拉的拉，干开了。开始两天，还觉得不怎么样。到第三天，每拉到试验田的坡下，李银就发了愁，看看大家想想自己，实在是累了。他想：这时候要有头牲口，即使是一头小毛驴，该多好哟。这一天，他虽然明知道各队都没有牲口在家，仍然抱着一线希望，走到了饲养院。在那里，他除了看到三条病牛以外，就是饲养员请不到兽医的焦急面孔。
    李银从进畜牧学校到下放，关于牲口的重要性的道理虽然听过千百次，但是从没有像这个时候那样，对牲口有这样深的感情。那几天，他反复地想：农村畜牧工作实在应该好好抓一下。但靠谁来抓呢？想到这里，他好像又听见了四年前毕业时，校长的临别赠言：“你们要记住，你们是党和人民培养出来的畜牧干部，不要辜负了党和人民对你们的期望。”当时，他不觉得这些话有什么分量，这时候想起来却铿锵作响。他几夜也没睡好，一闭上眼睛，就想起拉大车那个狼狈样子，饲养员焦急的面孔，自己过去的工作态度……。他最后想到，要是大家都像自己，农村的面貌什么时候才能改变呢？
    就在那几天，正碰上第四生产队的一头黄牛得了臌胀病，命在旦夕。李银听到这一消息后，就毫不犹豫地急忙找来一把烟叶和半斤香油，搅和在一起给牛灌了下去。经过两个钟头的急救，那头牛便转危为安。事情刚办完，他猛然想起：这下子群众都知道自己是兽医，一定会看不起自己。事实恰恰相反，群众不是在笑他，而是商议着给他送喜报，有的还要求给他送匾呢。这时候，李银开始感到羞愧了，但心里还憋着个疙瘩。晚上，他见到陈建三老大爷，又试探着问：“三叔，你看咱这一行怎么样？”陈老大爷说：“那要看谁说哩。地主、富农、大少爷们谁也不干这，人家嫌没出息。咱们庄稼户可不那么想。没有牲口，你说能干成个啥！”这一夜，李银又没睡好。他觉得陈建三的话很对，尖锐，有分量。他心里又觉得有点怕。想不到在自己思想上，有着这么严重的一个问题。这时候他才觉察到，自己过去的思想一直是和群众背道而驰的。
    兽医，配种员，饲养员
    对兽医这个行业，李银开始热爱了，而且积极行动起来。很快，他就帮助马家窑管理区成立了简易兽医站。不久，李银又发现管理区母畜空怀的很多，光治病，还是不能根本上解决畜力不足的问题。他心里想：干脆自己再当个配种员吧。可是他马上又否定了这一想法。因为他听说这一带有个老风俗，说干配种手不干净，倘若自己当个配种员，还不叫老乡们笑话！可是又怎么能见事不管呢？思想又矛盾开了。
    一天，副业股的白马发情了，旁边就拴着个种驴；可是村里没人会配种，到配种站又来不及，副业股长急得团团转。李银想下手，又觉得害臊。他几次想走过去，又退了回来。最后，当他想到大跃进多么需要牲口；想起有的老大娘因为他当了兽医，给大家办了事，悄悄地把包子放在他的枕头边；想到陈建三对他说的那几句令人心跳的话，他觉得不能再犹豫了。于是，他马上牵过种驴去给白马配种。种驴个子低，他还在驴屁股上扛了一膀子。一边干，他一边又想：上回群众没笑话他，这回可免不掉了。刚干完，脸就臊得通红。但是结果和上次一样，没有一个人笑他。社员马老叔说：“共产党的干部都是一个样，都是好干部。只要对咱老百姓有利，啥都干！”
    这是他平生第一次，听见群众把自己和伟大的共产党联系在一起。他想：自己是共产党的好干部吗？自己是只要对群众有利的事都干吗？想到这里，他真正害臊了。他马上就去找党支部书记，激动地把心里的事都倒了出来，并保证以后一定要作一个真正的好干部。他要求把那头种驴给他，让他当配种员和饲养员。党支部书记紧紧握住他的手，亲切地说：“太好了，党正需要你这样的干部！人民公社正需要你这样的干部！”李银听了，顿时觉得一股暖流流遍全身，激动得说不出话来。
          牲口疗养院
    从此，李银就搬到饲养院里去住。他除了喂着那头种驴和一头种牛以外，还给牲口医病。哪个队的牲口有了病，一时治不好，他就把牲口留在这里，边治边喂。有时，他成夜地守着病牲口。一次，有一头牛病得很厉害，天气也冷，他就把自己的被子给牛盖上。有的牛长了疮，他总是耐心地给洗，一直到好为止。有些二十多年的老牛，身瘦体衰，经过了李银的精心调养，都重新参加了生产。因此，群众称这个牲口圈为“牲口疗养院。”
    此外，他还给全管理区的牲口建立了档案，对畜牧工作提出了三十多条合理化建议。他一面积极向老饲养员学习，帮助他们总结经验，一面传授科学知识，使得马家窑病牲口大大减少，空怀现象也大大减少了。现在，全管理区的适龄母畜只有个别的没有怀胎。预计全区今年将增加幼畜五十头以上。
    目前，李银正在积极传授技术，以便将来在他回机关后，不影响马家窑的畜牧工作。同时，他还在积极搜集群众中对牲口喂养、管理、使用、繁殖、卫生等方面的经验，以充实自己。他说：“当你真正打算为畜牧事业贡献力量的时候，就会发现自己的业务水平还差得很远。”（附图片）
    李银给黄牛治病的当天晚上，又试探着问陈建三老大爷：“三叔，你看咱这一行怎么样？”陈老大爷说：“那要看谁说哩。地主、富农、大少爷们谁也不干这，人家嫌没出息。咱们庄稼户可不那么想。没有牲口，你说能干成个啥！”
