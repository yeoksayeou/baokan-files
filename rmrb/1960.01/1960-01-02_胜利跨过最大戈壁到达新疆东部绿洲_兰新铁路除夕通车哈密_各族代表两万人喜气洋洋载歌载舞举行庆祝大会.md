Xinhua News Agency, Hami, January 1st: The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, a major artery running through Northwest China, opened to Hami, an important town in the eastern part of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, on New Year's Eve 1959. Twenty thousand people of all ethnic groups from Hami and representatives of all ethnic groups from the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains who came to congratulate, held a grand celebration meeting here. At present, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has successfully passed through the largest Gobi Desert on the entire line—the sparsely populated and water-scarce area of more than 300 kilometers between Gansu and Xinjiang, reaching the eastern oasis of Xinjiang, entering the Xinjiang region for 186 kilometers, and is only more than 500 kilometers away from Urumqi. So far, the total mileage of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway that has been opened to traffic has reached 1,315 kilometers.

The snow-covered city of Hami and Hami Railway Station were filled with jubilation. Red flags fluttered in the snow, lanterns and decorations were everywhere, and people of all ethnic groups joyously sang and danced to celebrate the opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to Hami. Among those attending the celebration meeting were Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee; Saifudin, Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee and Chairman of the Autonomous Region; other party, government, and military leaders of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; as well as more than 200 representatives from all ethnic groups and all walks of life, including Uygur farmers and Kazakh and Mongolian herders from the banks of the Tarim River and the grasslands of the Tianshan Mountains.

D.A. Dabashin, the Soviet Consul General in Urumqi, was also invited to attend the celebration meeting.

After the meeting began, Wang Enmao and Saifudin, on behalf of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee and the Autonomous Region People's Committee, presented award banners to the railway construction workers and various units that supported the construction of the railway. Comrade Saifudin spoke at the celebration meeting, saying: The opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to Hami marks a fundamental change in the transportation situation in the Xinjiang region; it creates more favorable conditions for the construction of the Autonomous Region; and further strengthens the ties between the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region and the people of the whole country. This is the most cordial concern of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council for the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and a great victory for the Party's correct ethnic policy.

After the celebration meeting, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held at Hami Railway Station. When Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, cut the colored ribbon across the front of the locomotive, drums and salutes resounded throughout the station, and colorful balloons and flocks of peace doves flew into the sky. The first passenger train departing from Hami Railway Station, the Hami-Lanzhou direct express, whistled and slowly headed east.

The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway began laying tracks westward from the Weiya station in Xinjiang in mid-October 1959. Railway construction workers worked hard, overcoming difficulties such as water shortage in the Gobi Desert along the line, cold weather, and insufficient supply of materials. In more than two months, they laid 142 kilometers of tracks, reached Hami Railway Station, and quickly officially opened to traffic, meeting the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results.

The concern of the Party and government leaders of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the full support of the people of all ethnic groups played a decisive role in ensuring the opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to Hami. In order to overcome the shortage of sleeper supplies, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region specially allocated manpower and transportation capacity to organize a sleeper production team to harvest and transport sleepers in the Tianshan forest area north of Hami in the face of wind, snow, and severe cold. In more than two months, they rushed to produce 180,000 sleepers and transported them to the railway line in time, ensuring the track laying of the Weiya to Hami section of the railway. People's communes in the Hami area dispatched thousands of people and hundreds of large carts to support railway construction, providing a large amount of construction materials and various daily necessities to the railway construction site in a timely manner.

    胜利跨过最大戈壁到达新疆东部绿洲
    兰新铁路除夕通车哈密
    各族代表两万人喜气洋洋载歌载舞举行庆祝大会
    据新华社哈密1日电　贯通我国西北的大动脉兰新铁路在1959年除夕通车到新疆维吾尔自治区东部重镇哈密，哈密各族人民和天山南北各地前来祝贺的各族人民代表二万人，在此间举行了隆重的庆祝大会。目前兰新铁路已经胜利地通过了全线最大的戈壁滩——甘肃和新疆之间三百多公里人烟稀少的缺水地区，到达了新疆东部绿洲，进入新疆地区一百八十六公里，距离乌鲁木齐只有五百多公里。至此，兰新路全线通车的里程已达一千三百十五公里。
    银装素裹的哈密城和哈密车站上，一片欢腾，雪地里红旗飘扬，处处张灯结彩，各族人民喜气洋洋载歌载舞地欢庆兰新铁路通车到哈密。参加庆祝大会的有新疆维吾尔自治区党委第一书记王恩茂，自治区党委书记、自治区主席赛福鼎和新疆维吾尔自治区其它党、政、军负责人，还有远从塔里木河畔、天山草原来的维吾尔农民和哈萨克，蒙古等族牧民及各族各界代表二百多人。
    苏联驻乌鲁木齐总领事达巴申也应邀参加庆祝大会。
    大会开始后，王恩茂、赛福鼎代表新疆维吾尔自治区党委和自治区人民委员会向筑路职工和支援铁路修筑的各单位颁发了奖旗。赛福鼎同志在庆祝大会上讲了话，他说：兰新铁路通车哈密使新疆地区交通运输情况开始发生根本性的变化；为自治区的建设创造了更有利的条件；进一步密切了自治区各族人民和全国人民的联系。这是党中央、毛主席和国务院对新疆各族人民最亲切的关怀，是党的正确的民族政策的伟大胜利。
    庆祝大会结束后，哈密车站上举行了剪彩典礼。当自治区党委第一书记王恩茂剪断横拦在机车前面的彩绸时，车站上鼓乐礼炮齐鸣，天空中飞起了一片五色气球和成群的和平鸽子，从哈密车站开出的第一列客车，哈密——兰州直达快车鸣着汽笛徐徐向东驶去。
    兰新铁路1959年10月中旬从新疆境内的尾垭车站开始向西铺轨，筑路职工鼓足干劲，克服了沿线戈壁缺水，天气寒冷和材料供应不足等困难，在两个多月中，就铺轨一百四十二公里，到达哈密车站，并且迅速正式通车运营，达到了多快好省的要求。
    新疆维吾尔自治区党、政领导的关怀和各族人民的全力支援，对兰新铁路通车哈密起了决定性的保证作用。为了克服枕木供应不足的困难，新疆维吾尔自治区专门抽调人力和运输力，组织了枕木生产团，就近在哈密北面的天山林区冒着风雪严寒采制和运输枕木，两个多月就突击生产枕木十八万根，并及时运送到铁路沿线，保证了尾垭到哈密段铁路铺轨。哈密地区各人民公社抽调了上千的人力，数百辆大车，支援铁路修建，及时给铁路工地供应了大量建设材料和各种生活用品。
