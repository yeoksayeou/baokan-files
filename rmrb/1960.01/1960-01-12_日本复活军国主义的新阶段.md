    New Stage of the Revival of Japanese Militarism
    By Toyoda Shiro, Japan
    Ignoring the strong opposition of the Japanese people, the Kishi Nobusuke government decided that a delegation led by Kishi Nobusuke will sign a new US-Japan military treaty in Washington with the United States on January 19. The American "National Guardsman" weekly, published at the end of 1959, pointed out that the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" will promote the militarization of Japan. The magazine said that the revised US-Japan "Security Treaty" requires Japan to equip itself with nuclear weapons. Re-armament centered on nuclear armament marks a new stage in the revival of Japanese militarism. In fact, this new stage has already begun. After the Ground "Self-Defense Force" imported "Oerlikon" missiles in 1958, the Air "Self-Defense Force" also began to implement missile equipment. However, it is only in the past year that the Japanese army has blatantly carried out nuclear armament.
  Three Armed Forces Intensify Missile Equipment
    At present, the Japanese "Defense Agency" already possesses missiles capable of carrying atomic warheads. It has also designated bases for launching "Nike-Ajax" missiles and "Hercules" missiles, and announced plans to establish "five-unit system atomic divisions." According to the "Second Defense Capability Enhancement Plan," the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force will all be equipped with missiles by the end of 1965.
    The first rocket training team of the Japanese Army, located in the Anti-Aircraft Artillery School in Chiba City, is the main pillar for implementing missile equipment. Japanese Army experts have now gathered to conduct research on missile technology and theory. The Kishi Nobusuke government also plans to deploy American "Hawk," "Nike," and "Bomarc" surface-to-air missiles around major cities and straits. The Maritime "Self-Defense Force" is scheduled to have two submarines equipped with missile radar devices in 1960, and is studying "Tartar" ship-to-air missiles and anti-submarine missiles, as well as building destroyers equipped with "Tartar" missiles. The Air "Self-Defense Force" has been receiving air-to-air "Sidewinder" missiles from the United States since October 1958 (it is said that there were fourteen in 1958 and ninety in 1959). Not long ago, the Kishi Nobusuke government decided that the Lockheed F-104C jet aircraft to be adopted from 1962 is a long-range fighter that can be equipped with this type of missile. The unidentified "black aircraft" that caused a sensation in Japan last year is said to be this type of aircraft. The Japanese "Self-Defense Force" newspaper calls this aircraft the "last fighter of mankind." It seems that the Japanese and American reactionaries are advocating preparing for the so-called "last battle of mankind."
    Monopoly Capital Begins to Establish Missile Industry
    Another important symbol of the new stage of the revival of Japanese militarism is that Japanese monopoly capital has officially begun to establish an industry for producing missiles.
    On September 25, 1959, monopoly enterprises of the old Mitsui Zaibatsu system, centered on "Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company," Japan's largest electric company, established a rocket missile research institute. The six companies of the Mitsui system participating in this organization have the following division of labor: "Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company" is responsible for the electronics department; "Fuji Heavy Industries" and "Japan Steel Works" are responsible for the flight materials department; "Dainippon Celluloid Company" is responsible for the fuel department; "Tokyo Calculating Machine Company" is responsible for the automation department; and "Mitsui & Co." is responsible for overseas intelligence and technical negotiations.
    Prior to this, under the guidance of the "Defense Agency," Mitsubishi Group's "New Mitsubishi Heavy Industries," "Mitsubishi Electric," and "Asahi Chemical Industry" were responsible for researching the production of surface-to-air missiles; Fuji Precision Company Group of the Mitsui system was responsible for researching the production of anti-tank missiles; and Kawasaki Aircraft Company Group of the Sumitomo system was responsible for researching the production of air-to-air missiles. All of these companies maintain close technical cooperation with related American companies. However, the formation of the "Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company" group indicates that Japanese monopoly groups have officially begun research and trial production of missile weapons that can be equipped with nuclear warheads. At the same time, it is worth noting that on December 14, 1959, the Kishi Nobusuke government issued a license to Japan Atomic Energy Company to import a British atomic reactor.
    The "Defense Production Committee" under the Federation of Economic Organizations, the headquarters of the Japanese monopoly capital group, is actively engaged in activities for the production of missiles. In late September 1959, Akagi, the Director-General of the Japanese "Defense Agency," announced the "Second Defense Capability Enhancement Five-Year Plan" (1960-1965) in Sapporo. This "Defense Production Committee" immediately expressed its support for this plan, advocating that it should aim for 140 to 150 billion yen of military demand production annually, with 1966 as the peak year, and currently requesting a special investment and loan of 17.9 billion yen for equipment funds, 5.4 billion yen for research expenses, and 8.6 billion yen for trial production expenses.
    Monopoly capitalists are enthusiastic about supporting the revival of militarism in order to seize the highest monopoly profits by relying on military demand industries, especially the missile industry. The Kishi Nobusuke government is trying its best to support Japan's missile industry. Within 1958, Japan signed atomic energy agreements with the United States and the United Kingdom, increased the atomic energy budget by 23 billion yen, and was eager to establish an "Atomic Energy Agency" and join the U.S. International Atomic Energy Agency. The Kishi Nobusuke government is also trying to import uranium ore from Canada and South Africa and to exploit uranium ore domestically, especially accelerating the import of atomic reactors.
    With the progress of Japanese militarism's nuclear armament, Japan's missile production is also being intensified. In early September 1959, Japan's first domestically produced missile was successfully test-fired at the missile test site in Aomori Prefecture. On December 12, the Japanese "Defense Agency" used the "Oerlikon" missile launcher to conduct a test firing of a domestically produced surface-to-air missile. On December 14, a test firing of a domestically produced surface-to-surface missile was also held.
    Of course, Japanese-made missiles are still in their infancy. However, the fact that the Japanese ruling group today is trying to make missile production precede jet aircraft production cannot be ignored.
    Militarists Incite Nuclear Armament
    Another force supporting nuclear armament is the remnants of the old Tennoist militarism. They are not only extremely hostile to socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but also harbor aggressive ambitions towards other countries in Asia. They are doing their utmost to promote the missile equipment of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces."
    After Japan's defeat, the old militarists were once divided into pro-American factions, rearmament factions, and peace factions. Some former officers infiltrated the "Self-Defense Forces" under the protection of the US occupation army headquarters. According to surveys, among the officers of the "Self-Defense Forces" above the rank of San-sa (equivalent to a major before the war), former officers accounted for 49.9% in the Army, 95.5% in the Navy, and 64.4% in the Air Force. The three chiefs of staff (supreme commanders of the three armed forces) are all former military personnel.
    Militarists also exert pressure on the "Self-Defense Forces" from the outside. Adapting to the changes in the U.S. strategic system, they began to promote the necessity of possessing tactical nuclear weapons in 1958. For example, Hattori Takushiro, a former army colonel who was the secretary of Hideki Tojo and became a disciple of MacArthur after the war, published an article in the May 1958 issue of "National Defense" magazine, advocating that the "Self-Defense Forces" should not only be equipped with weapons such as radar, but also with missiles with nuclear warheads and offensive submarines. Another example is Hoshina Zenshiro, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, a former soldier and heavy industrial capitalist, published an article in the October 1958 issue of "National Defense Research" magazine, advocating that the "Self-Defense Forces" should implement nuclear armament. Furthermore, Akagi, the current Director-General of the "Defense Agency," is an important figure in the Kishi Nobusuke faction, and before the war he served as the secretary-general of the Ibaraki Prefecture "Taisei Yokusankai" (a reactionary militaristic organization). He is extremely zealous in implementing nuclear armament.
    It is this group of people who, in the current process of the revival of Japanese militarism, are trying their best to drag Japan back onto a more dangerous path of destruction.
    Tool for Suppressing the Japanese People
    The Japanese militarist forces that are accelerating their revival are not only tools for the US-Japan reactionaries to expand into Asia and oppose China and the Soviet Union, but also tools for suppressing the Japanese people.
    Not long ago, the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces," citing the "lessons of the Ise Bay Typhoon," declared that they would reorganize and strengthen their forces. This means dividing the existing six districts and four mixed brigades into thirteen divisions according to regional conditions. At the same time, in order to improve the mobility of the "Self-Defense Forces," headquarters of five "Area Armies" (corps) were established in Sendai, Sapporo, Tokyo, Itami, and Kumamoto respectively to command the divisions.
    In addition, the "Defense Agency" has also formed 50,000 reserve officers, organized 160,000 veterans into the "Teiyu Association," and begun to organize "Civil Defense Forces." The purpose behind this series of activities is to suppress the Japanese labor movement and democratic movement under the guise of "maintaining public order." Kaze Masanobu, a former army colonel, openly stated in an article published in the "Nagasaki Shimbun": "Reorganizing the Self-Defense Forces to make it a construction unit that suppresses 'Sohyo,' 'Zengakuren,' the Japan Teachers' Union, and deals with strikes by electrical workers and national railway workers, and integrates into the people in peacetime." In fact, in order to win over farmers and establish roots in rural areas, the "Self-Defense Forces" have already taken up the guise of "construction units," engaging in various activities from helping rural areas set up telephone lines, repairing roads, controlling pests, to transplanting rice seedlings, in an effort to get close to farmers.
    In this way, the "Self-Defense Forces" on one hand adopt a "integration" tactic in rural areas to influence farmers, and on the other hand investigate the activities of the Japanese Communist Party and progressive forces in the form of a "security log," providing important information to the US military authorities. The "Self-Defense Forces" have also made preparations to act together with the police and fire brigades to "maintain public order" once the Prime Minister declares a state of emergency.
      The US-Japan Reactionaries Share Common Interests
    On the issue of reviving Japanese militarism, the US-Japan reactionaries have common interests. From the American point of view, it wants to use the revived Japanese militarism as a tool to attack socialist countries and oppress the Japanese nation. The Japanese reactionaries want to take the opportunity to possess an army with "three-force balance" to suppress the Japanese people and carry out aggression against Southeast Asian countries, reliving the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The reviving Japanese militarism has two aspects: subordination to the US and a demand for "autonomy." However, at present, subordination to the US is the main and primary aspect. The United States is dragging Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" into the US strategic system through various aspects of activity such as US-aided weapons, US military advisory groups, studying abroad, and training.
    In order to make the "Self-Defense Forces" a reliable tool for them, the US-Japan reactionaries not only vigorously instill anti-Soviet and anti-communist ideas in officers and soldiers, but even use the traditional Japanese Bushido spirit for education. In order to revive militarism, US imperialism and its servants in Japan are embellishing the Tennoist Bushido spirit, dressing up Hirohito as a "human emperor" and a "scientist emperor" (Hirohito likes biology), while trying to obliterate his war criminal nature. They want to turn the Emperor into a partner of US-Japan monopoly capital. The Kishi Nobusuke government launched a "Crown Prince's wedding boom" in 1959, the purpose of which was to instill Tennoist Bushido ideology into the backward people. At the same time, it is also planning to revise the constitution and further utilize the Emperor politically.
    From 1958 to 1959, the US-Japan reactionaries vigorously revived militarism and the Bushido spirit by repairing the Ise Grand Shrine and Meiji Shrine, reviving Shintoism, and establishing memorial towers and statues of old military gods. At the same time, they are also intensifying the activities of the former military organization "Koyu Renmei" (Hometown Friends League), as well as the "Jinja Honcho" (Association of Shinto Shrines), "Landlords' League" and other fascist right-wing groups. Japanese monopoly capital groups are also organizing "Youth Development Teams" in rural areas and establishing branches of militarist organizations in factories and mines to undermine the workers' and peasants' movements.
    In short, the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" with the United States and the establishment of a new military alliance is aimed at further reviving Japanese militarism. And its important characteristic is that it promotes an anti-Soviet and anti-communist militarist spirit under the banner of "upholding freedom and democracy," and therefore has great aggressiveness and a revanchist ambition.
    In order to win the true independence of the Japanese nation and people's democracy, and to defend peace in the Far East, millions of Japanese people resolutely oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and will never allow the US-Japan reactionaries to drag the Japanese nation into the abyss of destruction.

    日本复活军国主义的新阶段
    日本　丰田四郎
    岸信介政府不顾日本人民的强烈反对，决定于1月19日由岸信介率领的代表团在华盛顿同美国签订新的日美军事条约。1959年年底出版的美国“国民前卫”周刊指出，新的日美“安全条约”将促进日本的军国主义化。这家杂志说，修改后的日美“安全条约”，要求日本以核武器装备起来。以核武装为中心进行重整军备，标志着日本复活军国主义的新阶段。事实上，这个新阶段早就已经开始了。1958年继陆上“自卫队”运进“厄利康式”导弹之后，航空“自卫队”也开始着手实行导弹装备。但是，日本军队明目张胆地进行核武装则是最近一年来的事情。
  三军加紧实行导弹装备
    目前，日本“防卫厅”已拥有能够装原子弹头的导弹。它还指定了发射“奈克—阿贾克斯式”导弹和“大力神式”导弹的基地，并且宣布了建立“五单位制原子师”的计划。根据“第二次增强防卫力量计划”规定，要在1965年年底以前使日本陆海空三军全部实行导弹装备。
    日本陆军设立在千叶市高射炮学校内的第一支火箭训练队，是实行导弹装备的主要支柱。日本陆军的专家们现在已经集中起来，正在进行关于导弹的技术和理论的研究工作。岸信介政府还计划把美国的“鹰式”、“奈克式”和“鲍马克式”地对空导弹配置在大城市周围及海峡地带。海上“自卫队”预定在1960年拥有两艘装备导弹雷达装置的潜水艇，并且正在研究“鞑靼式”舰对空导弹和反潜水艇导弹，以及建造装备“鞑靼式”导弹的驱逐舰。航空“自卫队”已经从1958年10月起从美国得到空对空“响尾蛇式”导弹（据说，1958年度是十四个，1959年度是九十个）。不久前，岸信介政府决定从1962年起采用的洛克希德F—104C式喷气飞机，就是可以装备这种导弹的远程战斗机。去年一度轰动日本的国籍不明的“黑色飞机”，据说就是这种飞机。日本“自卫队”机关报把这种飞机叫做“人类最后的战斗机”。看来，日美反动派正在鼓吹准备所谓“人类最后的战斗”了。
    垄断资本开始建立导弹工业
    日本复活军国主义新阶段的另一个重要标志，就是日本垄断资本正式着手建立生产导弹的工业。
    1959年9月25日，旧三井财阀系统的垄断企业，以日本最大的电机公司“东京芝浦电气公司”为中心，成立了火箭导弹研究机关。参加这个机关的三井系统的六个公司，作了这样的分工：“东京芝浦电气公司”负责电子部门；“富士重工业公司”和“日本制钢所”负责飞行材料部门；“大日本赛璐珞公司”负责燃料部门；“东京计算器公司”负责自动化部门；“三井物产公司”负责海外情报和技术问题的交涉。
    在这以前，曾经在“防卫厅”的指导下，三菱集团的“新三菱重工业公司”、“三菱电机公司”、“旭日化成公司”负责研究地对空导弹的生产；三井系统的富士精密公司集团负责研究反坦克导弹的生产；住友系统的川崎飞机公司集团负责研究空对空导弹的生产。所有这些公司都同美国有关的大公司实行密切的技术合作。但是，“东京芝浦电气公司”集团的形成，表明日本垄断集团正式着手进行可以装核弹头的导弹武器的研究和试作工作。同时，值得注意的是，1959年12月14日岸信介政府向日本原子能公司签发了进口英国原子反应堆的许可证。
    日本垄断资本集团的司令部——经济团体联合会下设的“防卫生产委员会”，为生产导弹积极进行活动。1959年9月下旬，日本“防卫厅”长官赤城在札幌发表了“第二次增强防卫力量五年计划”（1960—1965年）。这个“防卫生产委员会”立即表示支持这一计划，它主张以1966年度为最高点，今后每年进行一千四、五百亿日元的军需生产，并且在目前要求拨出设备资金一百七十九亿日元，研究费五十四亿日元，试验生产费八十六亿日元的特别投资和放款。
    垄断资本家之所以热心支持复活军国主义，是为了依靠军需工业，特别是导弹工业来攫取最高的垄断利润。岸信介政府正在极力设法扶植日本的导弹工业。1958年内，日本同美国、英国签订了原子能协定，把原子能的预算增加二百三十亿日元，并急于成立“原子能厅”，加入美国的国际原子能机构。岸信介政府还在设法进口加拿大和南非的铀矿和在国内开采铀矿，特别是加紧输入原子反应堆。
    随着日本军国主义核武装的进展，日本的导弹生产也在加紧进行中。1959年9月初，在青森县的导弹试验场上，日本国产第一号导弹试射成功。12月12日，日本“防卫厅”使用“厄利康式”导弹发射装置，举行了国产地对空导弹的试射。12月14日又举行了国产地对地导弹的试射。
    当然，日本国产的导弹还处在幼稚的阶段。但是，今天日本统治集团力图使导弹的生产走在喷气式飞机生产前面这一事实，是不容许忽视的。
    军国主义分子煽动核武装
    支持核武装的另一个势力，就是旧天皇制军国主义的残余分子。他们不仅极端仇视苏联、中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国等社会主义国家，并且对亚洲其它国家也抱有侵略的野心。他们正在极力鼓吹日本“自卫队”实行导弹装备。
    日本战败后，旧军国主义者一度分化为媚美派、重整军备派和和平派。一部分旧军官在美国占领军总司令部卵翼下混入了“自卫队”。据调查，现在“自卫队”中三佐（相当于战前的少佐）以上军官中，旧军官在陆军中占49．9％，在海军中占95．5％，在空军中占64．4％。三个幕僚长（三军最高司令官）都是旧军人出身。
    军国主义者还从外面向“自卫队”施加压力，他们适应美国战略体制的变化，从1958年开始宣传必须拥有战术的核武器。例如，曾任东条英机的秘书、战后成了麦克阿瑟门徒的旧陆军大佐服部卓四郎，在1958年5月号“国防”杂志上发表文章，鼓吹“自卫队”不仅应装备雷达等武器，而且应该装备带核弹头的导弹和进攻的潜水艇。又如，自由民主党议员、旧军人兼重工业资本家保科善四郎，在1958年10月号“国防研究”杂志上发表文章，主张“自卫队”应实行核武装。再有，现任“防卫厅”长官的赤城，是岸信介一派的重要人物，战前他作过茨城县“大政翼赞会”（反动的军国主义组织）事务局长。他对实行核武装异常卖力气。
    正是这班人，在今天日本军国主义复活过程中，极力想把日本再次拖上更危险的毁灭道路。
    镇压日本人民的工具
    正在加速复活的日本军国主义势力，不仅是美日反动派对亚洲进行扩张和敌视中苏的工具，而且是镇压日本人民的工具。
    不久以前，日本“自卫队”借口“伊势湾台风的教训”，声明要重新改组和加强它的力量。这就是把现有的六个管区四个混成旅按地区情况划分为十三个师团。同时，为了提高“自卫队”的机动性，在仙台、札幌、东京、伊丹、熊本分别设立五个“方面队”（军团）的本部以指挥师团。
    此外，“防卫厅”还组成五万名的预备役军官，把十六万名退伍者组织在“队友会”内，并且开始组织“民防队”。这一系列活动的目的，都是在“维持治安”名义下镇压日本的工人运动和民主运动。旧陆军大佐过政信在“长崎日报”发表的文章中公然说：“改组自卫队，使它成为镇压‘总评’、‘全学联’、日本教职员工会，以及对付电气工人和国营铁道工人罢工的建设部队，平时则使之融合在民众之中。”事实上，为了争取农民和在农村中扎根，“自卫队”已经打起“建设部队”的幌子，从帮助农村架设电话线、修路、治虫直到插秧的各种活动，极力同农民接近。
    这样，“自卫队”一面在农村采取“融合”战术，以影响农民，一面以“警备日志”形式调查日本共产党和进步力量的活动情况，向美军当局提供重要情报。“自卫队”还作好了一旦首相宣布紧急状态便同警察、消防队一起行动以“维持治安”的部署。
      美日反动派利害一致
    在复活日本军国主义这个问题上，美日反动派有着共同的利益。从美国方面说，它想利用复活了的日本军国主义作为攻击社会主义国家和压迫日本民族的工具。而日本反动派则想乘机拥有“三军均衡”的军队，用来镇压日本人民和对东南亚国家实行侵略，重温“大东亚共荣圈”旧梦。复活中的日本军国主义，有对美从属和要求“自主性”的两个方面。但是，现在对美从属是主要的、第一位的。美国对日本的“自卫队”，正通过美援武器、美军顾问团、留学、训练等各方面活动把它拖进美国战略体系。
    美日反动派为了使“自卫队”成为它们的可靠工具，不仅大力向官兵灌输反苏反共思想，甚至还利用传统的日本武士道精神进行教育。美帝国主义及其在日本的奴仆，为了复活军国主义，正在粉饰天皇制武士道精神，把裕仁打扮成“人间天皇”和“科学家天皇”（裕仁喜好生物学），而极力抹煞其战犯的本性。它们想把天皇变成美日垄断资本的小伙伴。岸信介政府在1959年掀起一场“皇太子结婚热潮”，其目的就是要向落后的国民灌输天皇制武士道思想。同时，它还策划修改宪法，在政治上进一步利用天皇。
    美日反动派从1958年到1959年，从修整伊势神宫、明治神宫、复活神道教到建立忠灵塔和旧军神像等，大肆复活军国主义和武士道精神。同时，它们还加紧组织旧军人的团体“乡友联盟”以及“神社厅”、“地主联盟”和其他法西斯右翼团体的活动。日本垄断资本集团也在农村组织“青年开发队”，在厂矿组织军国主义组织的支部，来破坏工人农民的运动。
    总之，岸信介政府同美国修改日美“安全条约”和建立新的军事同盟，目的是要进一步复活日本军国主义。而其重要的特征，则是以“拥护自由民主”为招牌，灌输反苏反共军国主义精神，因而具有极大的侵略性和复仇主义野心。
    为了争取日本民族的真正独立和人民民主，为了保卫远东和平，千百万日本人民坚决反对日本军国主义的复活，绝不容许美日反动派把日本民族拖入毁灭的深渊。（附图片）
