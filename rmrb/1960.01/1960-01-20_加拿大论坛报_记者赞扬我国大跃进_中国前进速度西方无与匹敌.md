Xinhua News Agency, January 19th -- The January 18th issue of the "Canadian Tribune" published an article by its reporter, Sydney Gordon, reporting on China's Great Leap Forward in 1959. The article is titled: "China's Pace of Progress is Unmatched in the West; 'Great Leap Forward' will Continue in the Sixties." The reporter wrote: "China enters 1960 under these circumstances: It knows that it has become stronger by advancing steadily last year and is determined to continue the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in the coming decade."

The reporter pointed out that China completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule in 1959 – the second year of the Great Leap Forward. This pace of progress is incomparable in any other place in the capitalist world.

Gordon wrote: In the two years that ended last month, the output of almost all heavy industrial products has more than doubled. In a country that previously had no industry and could not even feed its people, there is now industry all over the country.

The reporter emphasized that one of China's most significant achievements in 1959 was overcoming extraordinary natural disasters and achieving a bumper harvest in agriculture. He wrote: "Last year, during the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, China suffered a series of severe droughts and floods unprecedented in decades, affecting one-third of the country's cultivated land. Before liberation, natural disasters of much smaller scale always caused millions of deaths. However, now the People's Commune system has reversed the situation, enabling a quarter of humanity for the first time to avoid suffering during unprecedentedly severe natural disasters, and in fact, the total grain harvest has also increased significantly. Undoubtedly, people will always regard this achievement as one of the great victories of the first decade of the new China." The reporter also reported on the movement of agricultural technological innovation in China last year and the increase in the income of communes and commune members. He pointed out that in different regions, the increase in commune members' income ranged from 10% to 40%. During the same period, urban bank deposits also increased by 75% compared to the previous year. In a country without private merchants, this situation clearly shows that the people's living standards have been greatly improved. At the same time, the quantity of many commodities on the market has increased, and the quality has also improved.

The reporter listed the larger-scale construction activities of the Chinese people in the new year and emphasized that this is not just some statistical figures. He wrote: "Anyone who laughs at China's plan to catch up with Britain in industry will live to see this leaping horse gallop past them."

    “加拿大论坛报”记者赞扬我国大跃进
    中国前进速度西方无与匹敌
    据新华社19日讯　18日一期的“加拿大论坛报”刊载了该报记者悉尼·戈登的一篇文章，报道中国1959年大跃进情况。文章题目是：“中国的前进速度在西方是无与匹敌的；‘大跃进’在六十年代将继续下去”。记者写道：“中国是在这种情况下进入1960年的：它知道它在去年着着前进而变得强大，并且下定决心要在今后十年在工农业方面继续大跃进。”
    记者指出，中国在1959年——大跃进的第二年提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。这种进展的步伐在资本主义世界任何别的地方都是无可比拟的。
    戈登写道：在上个月完结的那两年时间里，差不多所有重工业产品的产量都翻了一番以上。在一个以前没有工业并且无法使它的人民得到温饱的国家里，现在全国各地都有了工业。
    记者强调指出，1959年里中国最显著的成就之一是战胜了特大自然灾害而获得农业的大丰收。他写道：“去年春夏秋三季，中国遭受了一连串几十年来所未有的严重的水旱灾，受灾面积占全国耕地的三分之一。解放前，范围比这小得多的自然灾害总是造成几百万人的死亡。然而，现在人民公社制度却把形势扭转过来了，头一次使占全人类四分之一的人口在空前严重的自然灾害中没有受到苦难，而且实际上，粮食收获总量还大量增加。毫无疑问，人们将永远把这一成就看成是新中国第一个十年取得的伟大胜利之一。”记者还报道了去年中国农业技术革新的运动和去年公社和社员的收入增加的情况。他指出，在不同的地区，社员收入增加幅度由10％到40％。在同一期间，城市银行的存款也比前一年增加了75％。在一个没有私商的国家，这种情况就清楚表明，人民生活水准已经大大提高。同时市场上许多商品的数量有了增加，而且质量也提高了。
    记者列举了中国人民在新的一年中的更大规模的建设活动，并且强调指出这个不仅仅是一些统计数字。他写道：“凡是嘲笑中国在工业方面要赶上英国的计划的人们，都会活着看见这匹飞跃之马将在他们旁边疾驰而过。”
