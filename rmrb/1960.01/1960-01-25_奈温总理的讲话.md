Prime Minister Ne Win's Speech
Your Excellency Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, Friends,

I am very grateful to Your Excellency and the Government of the People's Republic of China for giving me the opportunity to visit this great country again, and I thank you for holding this banquet tonight to welcome me.

As Your Excellency pointed out, this is not my first friendly visit to China. I still recall with great pleasure my visit in September 1955, when I made many friends. Now that I am visiting for the second time, I eagerly hope not only to renew the old friendships established at that time, but also to establish more new friendships. It so happens that this visit is on the eve of the traditional Chinese Spring Festival, which, as Your Excellency said, and I fully agree, is an auspicious sign.

Our two peoples have lived in fraternal friendship for centuries. Therefore, when I come to China, I do not feel that I have come to a foreign country or among strangers. This friendship has greatly developed since the victory of the struggle against foreign rule by the people of both Burma and China. I feel that we should, and still can, further strengthen our friendship and enhance mutual respect in this era when we have already achieved freedom. Therefore, we have a task to strengthen this friendship day by day, and I am deeply convinced that this effort will bear fruit.

Although our two countries have different political systems, the Burmese and Chinese people are the same in many ways. We are both against war, and we have both accepted the principles of non-interference in internal affairs and peaceful resolution of disputes on the basis of equality. Past imperialist rule and foreign exploitation have left both of our countries in a state of extreme economic backwardness. Therefore, both of our countries must do our best to use all available resources and energy to improve the living standards of our people. In order to achieve this goal, we need peace more than ever before. The histories of our two countries are full of such similarities. Therefore, our relations throughout history have been very harmonious, and we understand and respect each other's views.

Speaking of fraternal friendship, I think it is necessary and should mention the mutual assistance between our two countries. Since the end of foreign rule or influence, the economic relations between our two countries have greatly developed; I am deeply convinced that our close economic relations will continue to develop. Because this relationship is not based on selfish intentions but on mutual benefit. The growing friendly and close cooperative relations between our two countries not only conform to the interests of both sides, but also contribute to the cause of world peace and international cooperation. Therefore, the government and people of the Union of Burma attach great importance to this relationship and eagerly hope to maintain and further strengthen this relationship through the joint efforts of the governments and peoples of the two countries. Our ties have not only developed in the economic field, but our two countries have also exchanged cultural delegations with great success. Historically, the exchange of such cultural delegations began centuries ago.

May Burma and China, with many common goals, jointly build a building of eternal friendship on the basis of complete understanding and no doubt. May Burma and China, which are successfully building peace in Asia and the world and resolutely oppose the policy of war, work together calmly and peacefully to solve all problems.

I propose
For Burmese-Chinese friendship,
For the solidarity of Asian and African countries and world peace,
For the prosperity of the People's Republic of China and the happiness of the Chinese people,
For the health of His Excellency Mr. Zhou Enlai and other leaders of the Government of the People's Republic of China,
For the health of His Excellency Mr. Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China,
Cheers!

### 奈温总理的讲话

专栏：

    奈温总理的讲话尊敬的周恩来总理先生阁下，朋友们，
    我十分感谢阁下和中华人民共和国政府给予我机会，使我能够再次访问这个伟大的国家，并且感谢今天晚上为欢迎我举行这个宴会。
    正像阁下所指出的，我并不是第一次来中国作友好访问。我依旧极其愉快地回忆起1955年9月的访问，那时我结识了很多朋友。现在我是第二次来访问，我殷切地期望不仅重叙当时建立的旧的友谊，而且可以建立更多的新的友谊。碰巧这次访问是在中国人民传统的春节的前夕，正像阁下所说，而且我也完全同意，这是一个吉兆。
    我们两国人民若干世纪以来相处在兄弟般的友谊之中。因此，到了中国，我不感到是来到一个异邦或者来到陌生人中间。在缅中两国人民反对外国统治的斗争胜利以后，这种友谊有了很大的发展。我感到我们应该、而且仍然可以，在目前我们已经取得自由的时代来进一步密切我们的友谊和增进相互的尊重。因此，我们有任务使这个友谊日益加强，而且我深信这种努力一定会收到成果。
    虽然我们两国的政治制度不同，缅中人民在许多方面是相同的。我们都反对战争，我们都接受了互不干涉内政和在平等的基础上和平解决争端的原则。过去的帝国主义统治和外国的剥削使我们两国处在经济上极其落后的状态。因此我们两国都必须尽力利用一切可以利用的资源和精力来提高人民的生活水平。为了达到这个目的，我们比过去任何时候更其需要和平。我们两国的历史上充满了这种类似之点。因此，我们在整个历史上的关系都是十分和睦的，彼此都了解和尊重对方的观点。
    谈到兄弟般的友谊，我认为有必要而且应该提一提我们两国间的互相帮助。自从结束外国统治或势力以来，我们两国间的经济关系有了很大的发展；我深信我们紧密的经济关系将继续发展。因为这种关系不是基于自私的打算而是基于互利。我们两国间的日益增长的友好和紧密合作的关系不仅符合我们双方的利益，而且有助于世界和平和国际合作的事业。因此缅甸联邦的政府和人民极端重视这种关系，并且热切地希望通过两国政府和人民的共同努力来维护和进一步加强这种关系。我们的联系不仅在经济方面有了发展，我们两国还卓有成效地交换了文化代表团。从历史上看来，这种文化代表团的交换早在几世纪以前就开始了。
    愿抱有很多共同目标的缅甸和中国在彻底了解和毫无疑惧的基础上共同建立起永恒友谊的大厦。愿成功地建立着亚洲和世界和平，坚决地反对战争政策的缅甸和中国心平气和地和和平地为解决一切问题而共同努力。
    我提议
    为缅中友谊，
    为亚非各国的团结和世界和平，
    为中华人民共和国的繁荣和中国人民的幸福，
    为周恩来先生阁下和中华人民共和国政府的其他领导人的健康，
    为中华人民共和国主席刘少奇先生阁下的健康，
    干杯！
