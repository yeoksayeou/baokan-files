Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 19th: A spokesman for the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan announced today that 3.6 million workers belonging to "Sohyo" and another 750,000 workers from independent unions held rallies across the country today to oppose the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

The spokesman said that the workers today reiterated their determination to continue the struggle until they defeat the government's plan to have the Diet approve the revised "Security Treaty" and abolish the new "Security Treaty." He also said that the workers would deliver protest letters to the Japanese government and the U.S. government.

He said that today, many trade unions flew flags at half-mast. Many union members advocated various forms of propaganda campaigns against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

He announced that the "Sohyo" headquarters, representing 3.6 million union members, had written a letter of protest to Eisenhower. Sohyo also sent Yuboto Mio, head of the Political Department, and Tanabashi Shigeru, head of the International Department, to deliver the letter of protest to the U.S. President to the U.S. Embassy.

The letter of protest to the U.S. President stated that the revised "Security Treaty" is a treaty that will lead Japan down a path of suicide. The letter accused the new treaty of meaning that the Northeast Asia Treaty Organization, which threatens Asian peace, has in fact been formed. The letter also said that the "prior consultation" included in the new treaty does not give Japan a veto power in the situation where it is already subservient to the United States. The letter emphasized that this is therefore a violation of Japanese sovereignty.

Today, students also launched nationwide protest actions. According to reports, 200,000 students held rallies or demonstrations today.

In Tokyo, 7,000 students held a rally. After the meeting, they demonstrated with placards. The placards read "January 19th is a day of national humiliation" and "Nobusuke Kishi is an American." Demonstrators went to the police headquarters to demand the immediate release of the 85 students currently detained.

The Japan Socialist Party held a Kyushu regional conference in Arao City, Kumamoto Prefecture, today. The meeting decided that in order to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty," the Socialist Party organizations in various prefectures of Kyushu will hold parades in each prefecture in mid-February, and hold a Kyushu conference against the revision of the "Security Treaty" in Fukuoka City in late February or early March.

The Kyushu regional conference of the Socialist Party issued an appeal today stating that in order to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and to defend democracy to smash the conspiracy of the reactionary forces, we must fight to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 19th: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial today emphasizing that the new "Security Treaty" signed with the United States by the "plenipotentiary delegation" headed by Nobusuke Kishi, who cannot represent the Japanese people, is invalid. We must further launch a struggle against the Diet's approval of the new "Security Treaty" in order to shatter the conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty."

The editorial pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke and his party left Haneda Airport for the United States like they were running away amidst the high tide of protests from millions of Japanese people. This is because they went to the United States not for the interests of the Japanese nation and people, but for the interests of U.S. imperialism and a handful of reactionary traitors in Japan, to sell out the interests of the Japanese nation and people to the United States.

The editorial said that they want to forcibly sign a new "Security Treaty" under the welcome of their American masters, but the Japanese people will never allow it to be signed. When the "plenipotentiary delegation" headed by Nobusuke Kishi returns to the country, the Japanese people must launch a protest struggle of a larger scale than when they left the country to "welcome" them.

"Akahata" then summarized the achievements and characteristics of the increasingly high tide of the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

"Akahata" pointed out that the strong struggle of millions of workers, peasants and people from all walks of life against the "Security Treaty" has encouraged tens of millions of Japanese people and peace-loving people around the world, and at the same time, it has formed tremendous pressure on the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party, as well as U.S. imperialism, and this political significance is great.

The editorial pointed out that the struggle has not only expanded and strengthened, but also people have recognized the enemies of the Japanese people in the struggle: Japanese monopoly capital, the Nobusuke Kishi government, the Liberal Democratic Party, and U.S. imperialism.

The editorial called on all JCP members to unite all forces opposing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and to strive for the victory of the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The editorial pointed out that more than 800 joint struggle organizations have been established across the country, which marks a further strengthening of the nationwide unity, and the struggle is being carried out in a very organized manner.

"Akahata" emphasized the need to focus on combining the struggle inside the Diet with the mass struggle outside the Diet, to exert pressure on the Diet with the strength of the masses, and to force the Diet to dissolve.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 19th: The Japanese "Hokkaido Shimbun" published an editorial on January 8th exposing the deceptive propaganda spread by the Nobusuke Kishi government that the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" can "restore Japan's autonomy."

The editorial said: "If someone calls this revision the restoration of our country's autonomy and considers it an improvement to the current treaty, then we have to consider this idea a clear illusion, or even a malicious prejudice. In fact, if we look at the new treaty, we can also know that most of what our country has obtained in the name of autonomy and equality is nothing more than a written guarantee that the U.S. military has the obligation and intention to defend Japan, and vaguely worded exchange documents on prior consultations, while the U.S. side has hardly lost any vested rights and interests."

The editorial said, "The U.S. military's exclusive right to use all of Japan's territory as a base has not changed at all. On the contrary, the U.S. military has even acquired a new right (a new obligation for Japan) to take joint action with the U.S. military when the U.S. military bases in Japan are attacked. According to common sense, there is nothing more strange than revising an unequal treaty of subordination without making any actual concessions on the other side, but instead having our side assume an excessive burden."

The editorial pointed out that "the real autonomy that the people urgently hope to restore lies in relaxing the ties of the past Japan-U.S. relationship and strengthening one's own freedom." However, Foreign Minister Fujiyama's so-called restoration of Japan's "autonomy" is clearly not for relaxing the ties of the Japan-U.S. military system. The result of restoring this "autonomy" is to purchase Lockheed jet fighters, to equip the "Self-Defense Forces" with missiles, and to re-propose the "Secrecy Law" and "Police Duties Law" amendments, and even to amend the Constitution.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 18th: The Japan Broadcasting Corporation radio station issued a commentary yesterday pointing out that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a military alliance.

The commentary said that according to the new treaty, Japan's responsibilities have increased. In the event of an emergency, Japan will have to fight alongside the United States. Therefore, public opinion is also saying that the previous "Security Treaty" was an agreement to supply bases, while this treaty has become a military alliance.

The commentary expressed doubts about the so-called "prior consultation" provisions. It said that according to the government's explanation, the U.S. military must consult with the Japanese government when deploying from Japan. However, in practical terms, the extent and scope of this agreement are debated in the Diet and in society.

The commentary expressed dissatisfaction with Japan's continuous expansion of armaments.

The commentary said that in contrast to the speech made by Soviet Minister of the Council Khrushchev at the Supreme Soviet meeting regarding the reduction of the armed forces by 1.2 million people and the reduction of military expenditures, Japan's military is increasing, even if it is only a small number, it is thought-provoking.

The Japan Shortwave Radio Station also issued a commentary yesterday saying that after the signing of the new "Security Treaty," a solid military, political, and economic relationship between Japan and the United States will be established for the next ten years, which is a step towards the "new era of Japan-U.S. relations" that Nobusuke Kishi hopes for.

The commentary believes that according to the new treaty, the obligations assumed by Japan will definitely not be small. In the military, it is necessary to make appropriate efforts for "defense," and in the economy, it will also be forced to implement "liberalization" (i.e., relaxation of restrictions on the United States) in exchange and trade.

    四百多万工人学生集会示威反对缔结日美军事同盟
    日本人民不许岸信介出卖民族利益
    “赤旗报”号召群众起来阻止国会批准新的“安全条约”
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会发言人今天宣布，属于“总评”的三百六十万工人和另外七十五万名独立工会的工人，今天在全国各地举行集会，反对签订日美军事同盟条约。
    发言人说，工人们今天重申他们决心要继续斗争，直到他们击败政府使国会批准修改后的“安全条约”的计划和废除新“安全条约”为止。他并且说，工人们将把抗议信交给日本政府和美国政府。
    他说，今天，许多工会都下半旗。许多工会会员倡导各种形式的反对修改“安全条约”的宣传运动。
    他宣布，“总评”总部代表三百六十万名工会会员写信给艾森豪威尔表示抗议。总评还派政治部负责人柳本美雄和国际部负责人种桥茂把致美国总统的抗议信交给美国大使馆。
    致美国总统的抗议信说，修改后的“安全条约”是将使日本走上自杀的道路的条约。信中指责说，新的条约意味着威胁亚洲和平的东北亚条约组织事实上已经组成。信中还说，列入新条约中的“事先协商”，并没有使日本在已经存在的它屈从美国的状况下具有否决权。信中强调说，因此这是侵犯日本主权的。
    今天，学生也展开了全国性的抗议行动。据消息说，有二十万名学生今天举行了集会或示威。
    在东京，有七千名学生举行集会。会后，他们举着标语牌示威。标语牌上写着“1月19日是国耻日”，“岸信介是美国人”示威者到警察厅去，要求立即释放目前被拘禁的八十五名学生。
    日本社会党今天在熊本县荒尾市举行九州地区会议。会议决定，为了反对修改“安全条约”，社会党在九州各县的组织将在2月中在各县举行游行，在2月下旬或3月上旬在福岗市举行反对修改“安全条约”的九州大会。
    社会党九州地区会议今天发表呼吁书说，为了阻止修改“安全条约”，为了保卫民主以粉碎反动权力的阴谋，要斗争到底。
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论强调指出，由不能代表日本人民的、以岸信介为首的“全权代表团”同美国签订的新“安全条约”是无效的，我们必须进一步掀起反对国会批准新“安全条约”的斗争，以便粉碎修改“安全条约”的阴谋。
    社论指出，岸信介等一行在几百万日本人民的抗议运动高潮中，好像逃跑一样离开了羽田机场到美国去。这是因为他们到美国去不是为了日本民族和人民的利益，而是为了美帝国主义和日本一小撮反动卖国势力的利益，要把日本民族和人民的利益出卖给美国。
    社论说，他们在美国主子的欢迎下要强行签署新的“安全条约”，但是日本人民是绝不容许签署的。当以岸信介为首的“全权代表团”回国的时候，日本人民一定要掀起比他们出国时规模更大的抗议斗争来“迎接”他们。
    “赤旗报”接着总结了日益高涨的阻止修改“安全条约”斗争的成就和特点。
    “赤旗报”指出，几百万工人、农民和各阶层人民反对“安全条约”的坚强斗争，鼓舞了几千万日本人民和爱好和平的世界人民，同时对岸信介政府和自由民主党以及美帝国主义形成了巨大的压力，这个政治意义是巨大的。
    社论指出，斗争不仅扩大了和加强了，并且人民在斗争中认清了日本人民的敌人——日本垄断资本、岸信介政府、自由民主党以及美帝国主义。
    社论号召日共全体党员团结一切反对日美“安全条约”的力量，为使阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争取得胜利而奋斗。
    社论指出，在全国成立了八百多个共同斗争组织，这标志着全民性的团结有了进一步的加强，而且斗争是很有组织地展开的。
    “赤旗报”强调要着重把国会里面的斗争和国会外边的群众斗争结合起来，以群众力量对国会施加压力，迫使国会解散。
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本“北海道新闻”1月8日发表的一篇社论揭露了岸信介政府散布的所谓修改日美“安全条约”能够“恢复日本的自主性”的欺骗宣传。
    社论说：“假如有人把这种修改叫作恢复我国的自主性，并且认为是对现行条约的改善，那么，我们就不得不认为这种想法是一种明显的错觉，甚至是一种恶意的偏见。实际上，我们看一看新条约，也可以知道：我国在自主、平等的名义下所得到的东西，大部分都只不过是明文规定美军有保卫日本的义务和意思含糊的关于事先协商的交换文件等纸上的保证，而美国方面几乎没有失去既得权利和利益。”
    社论说，“美军把全部日本领土作为基地这种排他性的权利一点也没有变动，相反地，美军甚至获得了美军在日本的基地遭到进攻的时候日本也要同美军共同采取行动这样一种新的权利（对日本来说是一种新的义务）。修改不平等的从属性的条约，没有使对方作出任何实际上的让步，反而使我方承担了过重的负担，按照常识看来再没有比这件事情更加奇怪的事了。”
    社论指出，“人民所迫切希望恢复的真正的自主性，倒是在于放松过去的日美关系的纽带，加强自己的自由。”但是，藤山外相所说的恢复日本的“自主性”显然不是为了放松日美军事体制的纽带。恢复这种“自主性”的结果，就是购买洛克希德型喷气式战斗机，就是用导弹去装备“自卫队”，就是重新提出“保密法”和“警职法”修正案，甚至修改宪法。
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本广播协会电台昨天发表评论指出，新的日美“安全条约”是一个军事同盟。
    评论说，根据新条约，日本方面的责任加重了。一旦有事，日本就得同美国共同作战。因此舆论也在说，以往的“安全条约”是供应基地的协定，而这项条约成了军事同盟。
    评论表示怀疑所谓“事先协商”的规定。它说，据政府说明，美军从日本出动时，要同日本政府协商。但是在现实问题上，这种范围、约定，究竟能够相信到什么程度，这在国会上和社会上都有争论。
    评论对日本不断扩充军备表示不满。
    评论说，同苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在最高苏维埃会议上所作的裁减武装部队一百二十万人、削减军费的演说对照起来，日本的军队在增加，即使是少数，也是令人深思的。
    日本短波电台昨天也发表评论说，在签订新的“安全条约”以后，将建立起今后十年期间日美之间的军备上、政治上和经济上的牢固的联系，就是向岸信介所希望的“日美关系新时代”迈进了一步。
    评论认为，根据新条约，日本承担的义务决不会是很少的。在军事上需要对“防卫”作出适当的努力，在经济上也要被迫实行汇兑和贸易的“自由化”（即放宽对美国的限制）。
