    The U.S.-Directed Trip of Ngo Dinh Diem to Taiwan

    Xinhua News Agency commentary

    After the South Vietnamese "President" Ngo Dinh Diem recently colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and returned to Saigon, the South Vietnamese authorities announced on the 21st that Chiang Kai-shek himself had agreed in principle to make a "return visit" to South Vietnam; and Chen Cheng, the "Vice President" of Taiwan, will first go to South Vietnam for activities within this year. The collusion of these Asian political zombies is originally not worth mentioning; however, the further extension of the behind-the-scenes manipulators' claws in Asia is worthy of serious vigilance from the Asian people.

    It is noted that these foul figures from Asia's political garbage heap are stepping up their activities at the same time as the U.S. and the Kishi Nobusuke government signed the new U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. At a press conference held before leaving Taiwan, Ngo Dinh Diem talked about piecing together a military alliance of the three reactionary groups of Chiang Kai-shek, Ngo Dinh Diem, and Syngman Rhee, saying that South Vietnam, South Korea, and the Chiang Kai-shek group "will maintain contact with each other in the future to carry out anti-communist struggles." It has long been no secret that the U.S. imperialists are attempting to piece together a Northeast Asian military group based on the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Ngo Dinh Diem's trip to Taiwan and his remarks are just another public exposure of his American masters' conspiracy.

    Just before Ngo Dinh Diem went to Taiwan for activities, U.S. Secretary of the Army Brucker "visited" Taiwan, Saigon, and South Korea. Brucker clamored for war in these places and planned to transport more new weapons into South Korea. It is worth noting that when Brucker was in Taiwan, he openly clamored that the United States would use force to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, Penghu, and the Chinese inland islands such as Jinmen and Matsu. It is extremely obvious that Brucker's war clamors and activities are by no means a coincidence with the collusion between Ngo Dinh Diem and the Chiang Kai-shek group, but can only show that the United States is planning to create new tensions in Asia.

    The joint communiqué issued by Ngo Dinh Diem and Chiang Kai-shek makes this even clearer. In the joint communiqué, these two political zombies vigorously promoted the Cold War, clamored against communism, and demanded that the "free world" "not relax its vigilance" when the international situation tends to ease. From this joint communiqué, people heard the same tone as the warmongering of some figures in the U.S. ruling group.

    The ugly drama performed by these Asian political zombies under the direction of the United States once again shows what the United States' "peaceful intentions" are all about. These plans of the United States in Asia will only help the Asian people recognize the essence of U.S. imperialism's false peace and true arms expansion, and realize the truth that if the Asian people want to achieve true peace, they must thoroughly expose and crush the U.S.'s war plans.

    美国导演下的吴庭艳台湾之行
    新华社记者述评
    南越“总统”吴庭艳在最近到台湾同蒋介石集团勾搭了一通回到西贡以后，南越当局在21日宣布，蒋介石本人已经在原则上答应去南越“回访”；而台湾的“副总统”陈诚则将在今年内先到南越活动。这些亚洲的政治僵尸的互相勾搭本来是令人不屑一顾的；但是，这些傀儡人物背后牵线人的魔掌在亚洲的进一步伸张，却值得亚洲人民严重警惕。
    人们注意到，亚洲的这些政治垃圾堆里的腐臭人物是在美国同岸信介政府签订新的日美军事同盟条约的同时而加紧蠢动起来的。吴庭艳在离开台湾以前举行的记者招待会上，曾经谈到拼凑蒋介石、吴庭艳和李承晚三个反动集团的军事同盟问题。说什么南越、南朝鲜和蒋介石集团“将来将彼此保持接触来进行反共斗争”。美帝国主义者企图以日美军事同盟条约为基础来拼凑东北亚军事集团的阴谋早就不是什么秘密了，吴庭艳台湾之行和他的谈话，只是他的美国主子的阴谋的又一次公开暴露。
    就在吴庭艳去台湾活动之前，美国陆军部长布鲁克曾到台湾、西贡和南朝鲜进行了“访问”。布鲁克在这些地方大肆叫嚣战争，并且策划把更多的新式武器运入南朝鲜。值得注意的是，布鲁克在台湾时，公开叫嚷美国要用武力来阻挠中国人民解放台湾、澎湖以及金门、马祖等中国内海岛屿。极其明显，布鲁克的这些战争叫嚷和活动同吴庭艳和蒋介石集团之间的勾搭绝不是什么巧合，而只能表明美国正在亚洲策划制造新的紧张局势。
    吴庭艳同蒋介石发表的联合公报更清楚地表明了这一点。这两个政治僵尸在联合公报中极力鼓吹冷战，叫嚣反共，并且要求“自由世界”在国际局势趋向缓和的时候“不要放松警惕”。从这项联合公报中，人们听到了同美国统治集团中某些人物的好战叫嚣一样的腔调。
    在美国导演下由这些亚洲政治僵尸演出的丑剧再次表明了美国的“和平意图”究竟是什么货色。美国在亚洲的这些策划只会有助于使亚洲人民认清美帝国主义的假和平、真备战的本质，并且认识到亚洲人民要想获致真正的和平必须彻底揭露和粉碎美国的战争策划这一真理。
