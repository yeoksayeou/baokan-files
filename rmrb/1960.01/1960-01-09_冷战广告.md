    Cold War Advertisement
    Poem by Chi Bei'ou, Painting by Wang Letian
    The American "New York Times" published a large advertisement, not to promote razors, not to sell cheap soaps, but to advocate for the "Cold War," clamoring for "strength" diplomacy. Forget about easing the situation, forget about summit meetings, Western unity is paramount, military blocs come first. For "survival" and "development," "strength" must be reinforced. America is putting on a false show, the boss is scared to death, fearing the fake will become real, the tense situation will ease, affecting the arms business and damaging "self-interest."
    The "New York Times" published an advertisement by American monopoly capitalist Spahn on December 20th last year, titled "Demanding the Maintenance of Enlightened Self-Interest," expressing concern that the international situation is trending towards easing and advocating for strengthening the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    冷战广告
    池北偶诗  王乐天画
    美国“纽约时报”，登出大幅广告，不是推销剃刀，不是贱卖香皂。而是鼓吹“冷战”，叫嚷“实力”外交。休谈缓和局势，别想首脑会议，西方团结要紧，军事集团第一。为了“生存”、“发展”，必须加强“实力”。美国扮演假戏，老板怕得要死，唯恐弄假成真，紧张局势松弛，影响军火生意，损及“自我利益”。
    “纽约时报”去年12月20日刊登了美国垄断资本家斯帕内尔的一则广告，题目是“要求保持开明的自我利益”，表示担心国际局势趋于缓和，鼓吹加强北大西洋集团。（附图片）
