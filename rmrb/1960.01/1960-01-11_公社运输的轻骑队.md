    The Commune's Light Cavalry Transport Team
    By our reporter Shi Bo
    In the early winter morning, as the east just begins to show a hint of dawn, the streets around the Sangyuan Station in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, and the roads leading to various communes, become lively! Male and female commune members hum tunes, holding handlebars, and walk briskly back and forth. Some are transporting cotton and grain to the station, others are sending fertilizer and bricks back to the countryside. Looking around, it's truly a vivid picture of mass transport.
    This is a "Light Cavalry Transport Team" from the Chengguan Commune in Wuqiao County. It's called a light cavalry transport team because these vehicles are indeed the most nimble and lightweight on the transport line. A small rubber wheel supports a handcart frame, requiring little effort for a woman to push hundreds of pounds of goods at a time. The Chengguan Commune has over 100,000 mu of land, more than 9,600 households, over 9,000 male and female laborers, and 3,200 large rubber-wheeled carts. Since the Great Leap Forward, agricultural production has continuously increased, and commune-run industries such as machinery, sugar making, starch, and alcohol have also developed successively. As a result, transportation work has become particularly tight, and some land cannot be fertilized according to plan due to insufficient transportation capacity. To address this, the commune added 3,000 small handcarts. With this light cavalry team, transportation capacity has greatly improved. In 1959, all production teams in the commune delivered all the fertilizer to the fields according to plan in just over a day, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu increased by 100% compared to 1958.
    Speaking of handcarts, the commune members of Chengguan Commune in Wuqiao County truly love and enjoy them. Jiang Yancheng is the director of the Sixth Production Brigade Management Area of this commune and one of the earliest users of handcarts in the entire commune. He knows the benefits and performance of handcarts best. If you ask him about handcarts, he will tell you a lot about the advantages of handcarts: Hey, these carts are really good! Whether walking on field paths or dirt slopes and mounds, they are extremely nimble! Once you get the hang of it, it's like riding a bicycle, turning east when you want to go east, and turning west when you want to go west, without much effort! With these handcarts in our commune, delivering public grain and selling cotton, mobilizing hundreds of carts, can be completed in less than a day and a half. Whether it's plowing, weeding, harvesting, or sowing, the commune members push a handcart to work, and in the evening, they bring the harvested crops back to the commune. Bringing back a cart of green grass and feed provides pig feed and fertilizer.
    There is a cotton production team in Shuangliudian Village, all 31 members of the team are girls under the age of twenty. They contract 165 mu of high-yield cotton fields, averaging over 30,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. The transportation distance is more than five li. How many days would it take to fertilize more than 100 mu of land if they carried it on their shoulders and backs? If you are willing to do a small calculation, then you know that according to two women carrying 80 jin at a time, one mu of fertilizer requires two people to transport it 375 times. If one round trip of five li takes two hours, then it takes 93.7 labor days. However, because everyone has a small handcart and is a skilled driver, the entire team sends an average of 18 loads of fertilizer per person per day, carrying about 600 jin of fertilizer per cart each time, and they can deliver enough fertilizer to 20 mu of land in a little over a day. Because they applied more fertilizer and saved labor days, they used the extra time to strengthen the field management of cotton, making the cotton bolls grow bigger and more numerous. In 1959, the average yield per mu of 145 mu of land in the entire team reached 720 jin, and the yield per mu of 20 mu of high-yield land reached 1,128 jin, creating the highest yield per mu record in the entire commune.

    公社运输的轻骑队
    本报记者　史博
    初冬的早晨，东方刚刚露出一丝儿鱼肚白，河北省吴桥县桑园车站一带的大街上，通往各个公社的马路上，就热闹起来了！男女社员们哼着小调，手里握着车把，迈着轻快的步子，穿梭似地来往着。有的运棉、运粮到车站，有的送肥料、砖瓦回农村。放眼望去，真是一幅生动的群众运输图。
    这是吴桥县城关公社的一队“轻骑运输队”。说它是轻骑运输队，是因为这些车辆确确实实算得上运输线上最灵便、最轻巧的。一支小巧的胶轮，承着一副手推车架，不要费多大劲，一个妇女一次就能推走几百斤东西。城关公社有地十万多亩，九千六百多户，男女劳动力九千多个，大胶轮车三千二百辆。大跃进以来，农业生产不断增加，社办的机械、制糖、淀粉、酒精等工业也相继发展起来。这样，运输工作就显得特别紧，好些土地就因为运输能力不够，不能按计划施肥。为了这事，社里添置了三千来部小手推车。由于有了这支轻骑队，运输能力大大提高，一九五九年全公社各个生产队差不多在一天多的时间内，就按计划把肥料全部送到了地里，每亩地的施肥量比一九五八年增加了一倍。
    说起手推车，吴桥县城关公社的社员们真是个个爱，人人喜。姜延臣是这个社第六生产大队管理区的主任，也是全公社最早使用手推车的一个。他最了解手推车的好处和性能。你要问他手推车怎么样？他将会告诉你一大堆关于手推车的好处：嘿，这车子可好哩！别管走在田间小道上还是土坡、土岗上，它都灵巧极啦！只要一使上手，真像骑上自行车一样，叫东就东，要西就西，不用费劲！咱们公社有了这些手推车，缴公粮，卖棉花，出动几百辆车子，用不了一天半日就能完成。不管是耕、锄、收、播，社员们推上辆手推车出工，傍晚回家，就把收获的庄稼捎回社了。捎回一车青草、饲料，就有了猪食、肥料。
    双刘店村有个棉花作业队，全队三十一名队员都是二十岁以下的姑娘。她们包干一百六十五亩棉花丰产田，平均每亩要施底肥三万来斤，运输距离五里多，要是肩挑、背负得多少日子才能给一百多亩田施足肥？如果你愿意做次小统计，那么你就知道，按两个妇女一次抬八十斤计算，一亩地的肥料两个人就得运三百七十五趟，五里来回一次算两个钟头，就得九十三点七个劳动日。可是，由于她们人人都有一辆小手推车，个个都是驾车能手，全队每人平均每天送十八次肥，每次每车运肥六百来斤，一天多时间就能给二十亩地送足肥料。因为施肥多，又节省了劳动日，她们把多余的时间都用在加强棉花田间管理工作上，使棉桃结得大，结得多。1959年全队一百四十五亩地平均亩产达到了七百二十斤，还有二十亩高产田亩产达到一千一百二十八斤，创造了全公社最高亩产纪录。
