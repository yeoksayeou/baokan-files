Fellow Trades Cooperate Widely, Working Together to Solve Problems
    Tianjin Foundry Industry Comprehensively Plans to Concentrate Efforts on Attacking Manual Operations

    (Our Tianjin dispatch, January 21st) Tianjin's industrial departments have implemented city-wide professional collaboration in the foundry trade, which has solved the long-standing problem of foundry mechanization in the city.

    Whether Tianjin's machinery manufacturing industry can continue to leap forward depends first on whether foundry production can keep up. For a long time, many foundries and foundry workshops have been weak links in the machinery manufacturing industry. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization is relatively low. Among the fifty-two factories under the leadership of the Machinery Industry Bureau, there are only four hammer machines and fifteen molding machines; only three units have sand screening and sand cleaning equipment. 87.68% of foundry workers are engaged in heavy manual labor, from hammering iron, loading materials, and molding to pouring and cleaning sand, all relying on human labor to swing, carry, pound, lift, and pour, resulting in high labor intensity and low production efficiency. However, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the next process of foundry work—machining—is as high as 96.98%. With the rapid development of production, the transformation of foundry work has become an important link, and foundry workers are also eager to reduce heavy manual labor. Since November of last year, foundry workers throughout the city have launched a mass movement to vigorously promote mechanization and semi-mechanization. The foundry workers of the Power Machinery Factory, Hengyuan Textile Factory, and other five units have put forward more than 1,400 major innovation proposals in just a few days.

    In order to improve the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in foundry work in a faster, better, and more economical way, Tianjin's industrial departments broke through the boundaries of industries and factories from the very beginning, and vigorously promoted foundry professional collaboration. Professional collaboration groups were established from the city to the districts to comprehensively plan, concentrate efforts, combine indigenous and foreign methods, and attack key problems. Eleven factories, including the Tractor Manufacturing Factory, Internal Combustion Engine Factory, Textile Equipment Factory, and Weinan Machinery Factory, organized veteran workers, technicians, and cadres from various foundry workshops to form a foundry mechanization and semi-mechanization professional collaboration group. They conducted detailed analysis and comparison of different types of foundry machines manufactured by various factories in the city, selected and finalized models, comprehensively improved them, and selected more than ten types of machines that are highly efficient, simple to manufacture, and low in cost. Then, they divided the tasks and jointly manufactured them. For example, the Tractor Manufacturing Factory, with its strong technical force, drafted blueprints for various factories, the Textile Equipment Factory, with its large equipment potential, was responsible for producing all the castings for five belt hammer iron smashers, and the Weinan Machinery Factory was responsible for manufacturing the wooden molds for hand-push sand screening machines. In this way, the foundry workers of the eleven factories quickly achieved mechanization in hammering iron and screening sand, and the average degree of mechanization in each factory increased from 21.5% in the past to 45.3%.

    In order to strengthen professional collaboration, many factories also held foundry on-site meetings, exhibitions, observation meetings, and technical performance competitions to widely exchange experiences in foundry mechanization and quickly promote the experience of one factory or one district to the whole city. In just over a month, eight factories in the Hebei District with foundry workshops organized 365 experience exchange meetings and technical performance meetings on foundry mechanization and semi-mechanization; and according to the technical strength and equipment conditions of each factory, they divided the work and concentrated on manufacturing various machines, so that the foundry workers in the district quickly achieved mechanization of iron hammering, automation of charging iron melting furnaces, rail transportation of molten iron pouring, and electrification of sand screening.

    Some factories gave each other drawings and models of foundry-related machines, and some compiled their own experiences into books and distributed them to fraternal factories. Various factories also exchanged materials, equipment, and manpower, and obtained support from other trades. Twenty-two iron foundries and foundry workshops in the Hongqiao District established a large-scale material collaboration relationship. With the cooperation of other factories, they manufactured 25 simple iron smashing machines, charging machines, sand screening machines, and drum sand cleaning machines, as well as 22 light transport vehicles and simple cranes in just over a month, increasing the proportion of foundry workers using mechanical production from 25% to 54.6%.

    Through the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement, the appearance of foundry production in Tianjin has undergone significant changes. Many foundry workers have been freed from heavy manual labor. Iron blocks weighing one or two hundred pounds no longer need to be smashed with a 20-plus-pound hammer. The iron pieces will easily be crushed and automatically loaded into the furnace once the hammer is running. Workers who had been squatting on the ground for years to mold by hand can now stand up straight and use molding machines and pneumatic rammers to quickly make models. In the past, the molten iron ladles used for pouring required two to six people to carry. Now, only one person needs to gently push the overhead crane, and the ladle is transported from the vicinity of the furnace to the pouring site. Heavy manual labor has been basically eliminated, the capacity of castings has increased sharply, and the quality has also been greatly improved. For example, the foundry mechanization and semi-mechanization of the Alloy Steel Plate No. 2 Factory, which has only 157 people, increased from 40% in October last year to more than 80% at present, labor productivity increased by 60%, and the casting qualification rate also increased from 86% to 91.6%. There have also been significant changes in factories with relatively advanced equipment. For example, the molding workers of the Tractor Manufacturing Factory used machines only when manufacturing small castings in the past. Now, they have also achieved molding mechanization when manufacturing large parts such as cylinder blocks and rear axle half-axle sets. This has not only increased output by more than one time, but also reduced the rejection rate from 15% to 30% in the past to less than 10%. After many factories realized foundry mechanization and semi-mechanization, the utilization area of foundry workshops also expanded accordingly, and the cost of castings decreased correspondingly.

    In order to adapt to the situation after the improvement of foundry mechanization, Tianjin's relevant factories have also timely promoted more than 40 advanced molding and pouring techniques, such as lost mold casting, hard mold casting, wet mold casting, and multi-layer pouring.

    At present, Tianjin's industrial departments are analyzing and comparing various foundry-related machines, preparing to select some machines that are highly efficient, simple to manufacture, and easy to operate, finalize the design, mass produce them, and promote them comprehensively.

    同行大协作　同心破难题
    天津铸造行业全面规划集中力量猛攻手工操作
    本报天津21日电　天津市工业部门的铸工工种实行全市专业大协作，使全市长期没有解决的铸工机械化问题获得了解决。
    天津市机械制造工业能不能持续跃进，首先要看铸工生产能不能赶上去。许多铸造工厂和铸造车间，长期以来就是机械制造工业中的薄弱环节。机械化、半机械化程度都比较低，在机械工业局领导的五十二个工厂中，只有四台砸铁机、十五台造型机；有筛砂机和清砂设备的单位只有三个。铸工中有87．68％的人从事笨重体力劳动，从砸铁、上料、造型到浇铸、清砂都是依靠人力抡、背、捣、抬、端，劳动强度大，生产效率低。而铸工的下一工种——机械加工的机械化、半机械化程度却高达96．98％。随着生产的飞速发展，铸工的改造已经成为一个重要环节，铸造工人也迫切要求减轻笨重体力劳动。从去年11月份以来，全市铸造工人掀起了一个群众性的大搞机械化、半机械化的运动。动力机厂、恒源纺织厂等五个单位的铸工，在几天之内就提出重大的革新建议一千四百多件。
    天津市工业部门为了多快好省地提高铸工机械化、半机械化程度，一开始就打破了行业和工厂的界限，大搞铸造专业协作，从市到区都成立了专业协作小组，全面规划，集中力量，土洋结合，围攻关键。拖拉机制造厂、内燃机厂、纺织器材厂和卫南机械厂等十一个工厂，组织各铸工车间的老工人、技术人员和干部成立了铸工机械化、半机械化专业协作组，对全市各厂制造出来的不同类型的铸造机器进行细致的分析比较，选型定型，综合提高，选出十多种生产效率高、简单易造、造价低廉的机器。然后分工包干，联合制造。如技术力量较强的拖拉机厂为各厂晒制图纸，设备潜力较大的纺织器材厂负责生产五台皮带锤式砸铁机的全部铸件，卫南机械厂负责手推式筛砂机的木型制造等。这样很快就使十一个工厂的铸工实现了砸铁、筛砂机械化，各厂机械化程度平均由过去的21．5％提高到45．3％。
    许多工厂为了加强专业协作，还举办了铸工现场会、展览会、观摩会、技术表演赛会，广泛交流铸工机械化的经验，把一个厂、一个区的经验迅速推广到全市。河北区八个有铸工车间的工厂在一个多月的时间内，就组织了三百六十五次铸工机械化、半机械化的经验交流会和技术表演会；并且根据各厂的技术力量和设备情况进行分工，突击制造各种机械，全区铸工很快就基本上实现了砸铁机械化、化铁炉上料自动化、铁水浇铸轨道化、筛砂电动化等。
    有些工厂互相赠送有关铸造的机器图样、模型，有的把自己的经验编印成册，分赠兄弟工厂。各个工厂之间还在原材料、设备和人力方面互通有无，并且取得其他工种的支援。红桥区的二十二个铸铁厂和铸工车间之间建立了物资大协作关系，在其他工厂的配合下，一个多月中制造了简易砸铁机、上料机、筛砂机、滚筒清砂机二十五台和运输轻便车、简易吊车二十二部，使铸造工人用机械生产的比重由25％提高到54．6％。
    通过机械化、半机械化运动，天津市铸工生产的面貌起了显著变化。许多铸造工人从笨重的手工劳动中解脱出来。一、二百斤重的铁块，不用再抡二十多磅重的大锤去砸了，一开动砸铁机就会轻易的破碎开来，自动装进化铁炉内。多年来一直蹲在地上用手工造型的工人，现在直起腰来使用造型机和风动捣机，一个个的模型很快就能做好。过去浇铸用的铁水包，需要两个人到六个人抬，现在只要一个人轻轻地推动一下空中吊车，铁水包就从化铁炉旁运到浇铸场地。笨重体力劳动已经基本消灭，铸件能力猛增，质量也大大提高。例如，仅有一百五十七个人的合金钢板二厂的铸工机械化、半机械化程度，由去年10月份的40％提高到目前的80％以上，劳动生产率提高了60％，铸件合格率也由86％提高到91．6％。原来设备比较先进的工厂也有了重大的变化。如拖拉机制造厂的造型工人，过去只在造小型铸件时使用机器，现在制造汽缸体、后轮半轴备套等大型部件，也实现了造型机械化；这样不仅使产量提高了一倍多，废品率也由过去的15％到30％，降低到10％以下。许多工厂实现铸工机械化、半机械化以后，铸工车间的利用面积也随之扩大，铸件成本相应降低。
    天津各有关工厂为了适应铸工机械化程度提高以后的情况，还及时推广了漏模铸造、硬模铸造、潮型铸造和多层浇铸等四十多项造型和浇铸的先进工艺。
    目前，天津市工业部门正在对各种有关铸工的机器进行分析、比较，准备选择一些效率高、简单易造、操作方便的机器，定型后大量制造，全面推广。（附图片）
