This newspaper's Nanchang, 4th report: Qunli Commune comprehensively innovated tools and operating techniques in all processes of pig raising, achieving semi-mechanization of chopping feed, vehicularization of feed transportation, automatization of water use, high-yield cultivation of feed crops, and silage of green feed. With the number of live pigs quadrupling in one year, not a single herdsman was added, and not a single point of feed land was increased.

Qunli Commune is a red flag in pig raising in Jiangxi Province – the commune with the most pigs in Yushan County. By the end of last year, the commune had established 151 pig farms, raising more than 25,500 pigs, a fourfold increase compared to the beginning of last year; an average of 12 pigs per household, 3 pigs per person, and 2.4 pigs per mu of land. With the increase in the number of pigs, according to convention, the number of herdsmen and feed land should also increase accordingly. The Commune Party Committee mobilized the masses to adopt frugal methods, step by step innovating the tools and techniques for chopping, watering, and transporting feed, increasing feeding efficiency by four to eight times, solving the problem of the pig raising industry competing with agriculture for labor. Now, the average number of pigs raised by each of the 240 herdsmen in the commune has increased from 25 at the beginning of last year to 105, and they are raising them very well. At the same time, the feed land is still more than 700 mu, an average of 3 li of land per pig, more than one-third of what it used to be, and it can fully meet the needs.

As early as April last year, Qunli Commune established a pig raising technology innovation committee with the participation of technicians and iron and wood workers, with the first secretary of the Party committee personally taking charge, and organized the whole commune to carry out pig raising technology innovation. First, they innovated the chopping tool, which consumed the most labor and had the lowest efficiency. Iron, wood workers and technicians created more than a dozen tools, such as grass cutters, slicers, shavers, and grinders. These tools are ten times more efficient than manual cutting. A pig farm raising 100 to 200 pigs can completely solve the problem of cutting feed with just one person operating one machine. At present, more than 170 various types of cutting machines have been popularized throughout the commune, realizing the semi-mechanization of chopping feed.

Next, Qunli Commune realized the vehicularization of feed transportation. On the one hand, they used old wood to manufacture some native carts, and on the other hand, they repaired and utilized the earth carts, earth trains and wooden rails left over from water conservancy construction, and connected the traffic of each pigsty. The commune now has more than 1,500 feed transport vehicles, and more than 2,000 meters of wooden rails have been laid. Each vehicle can be pushed by one person, and each time it can transport 3,000 catties of feed, which is 30 times more efficient than manual carrying in the past.

In order to change the situation that carrying water and lifting water occupied a lot of labor, all the pig farms in the commune used Mao bamboo to make water pipes and used rammed earth to build ditches, leading water into the farm, saving a large amount of labor. For example, the 19 pig farms of the Fifth Production Brigade used to have 27 laborers carrying and lifting water. After realizing the automatization of water use, it could be managed concurrently by the herdsmen. The original 27 laborers were all transferred to agricultural production.

Qunli Commune took a variety of measures to achieve high-yield feed production. First, high-yield feed crops such as banana roots, sweet potatoes, Swiss chard, and radishes were selected. From planting to harvesting, one mu of banana roots can harvest stems and leaves seven times, plus tubers, with a yield of up to 50,000 catties. Second, corn was harvested green. Repeatedly cutting green corn as feed during the young seedling stage, cutting and growing at the same time, the yield per mu can be increased to 30,000 to 40,000 catties. Third, the number of rotations was increased. In the past, feed land only planted one season, with a yield of 3,000 to 4,000 catties per mu; now, Swiss chard is planted in spring, sweet potatoes or banana roots in summer, and radishes in winter, with an annual yield of 80,000 to 100,000 catties per mu, which is three to four times higher than in the past. Due to the reform of the feed crop cultivation method, the 700 mu of feed crops sown by the commune last year generally achieved a yield of 50,000 to 100,000 catties per mu, which is four to six times higher than in the past.

The commune also vigorously promoted the technical measures of feed silage, realizing the silage of green feed. In the past, artificial cooking of feed not only consumed labor but also fuel. Now, the commune has dug 2,000 silage cellars, each cellar silaging 3,000 to 5,000 catties of feed. Silaged feed can not only be directly fed to pigs, saving a large amount of labor and fuel for cooking feed, but also can be stored for a long time to meet the needs of the off-season.

At present, Qunli Commune is vigorously building new-style pig farms, further innovating pig raising technology, and striving to achieve automation of feed delivery and pen closing, and is also preparing to use water power as power to gradually realize the mechanization of feed processing. In this way, less labor than now can be used to raise more live pigs than now.

This newspaper's Jinan, 4th report: Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, vigorously reformed feeding tools in the high-speed development of pig raising, increasing the number of pigs raised by each herdsman from an average of 12 to 60, increasing efficiency fourfold. The county raised more than 670,000 pigs in 1959, more than five times more than in 1958.

The great development of pig raising in Shouzhang County once showed a phenomenon of occupying more labor. The Shouzhang County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China timely launched a mass movement to reform pig raising tools. In the half year from July to the end of last year, 42 kinds of pig raising tools were created and improved, totaling 26,800 pieces. All of the county's 2,973 pig farms have realized the mechanization or semi-mechanization of feed chopping, the automatization of water use, the vehicularization of feed and fertilizer transportation, the multi-pot cooking of feed, and the semi-automation of feeding tools, greatly saving labor.

Party committees at all levels led the reform of pig raising tools in a concrete and meticulous manner. All the pig farms and factories of the communes and teams established research groups for the reform of feeding tools. The county Party committee successively held on-site meetings on the reform of pig raising tools in Shimensong, Taiqian, Dabu and other communes, promoted the experience of technological innovation, and also stipulated methods of reward and commendation, stimulating the enthusiasm of the masses. More than 42,000 reasonable suggestions were put forward in more than four months.

Shouzhang County's creation and reform of pig raising tools first started with the reform of tools that consumed more labor, such as feed crushing, water use, and transportation, and adopted the method of going from simple to complex and from native to foreign. For example, feed crushers have successively created and reformed a variety of types such as manual, animal power, water power, and electricity. The pig farm in Lezhen Commune started with a hand-cranked crusher that could crush 2,000 catties of feed a day. Later, a diesel engine was used to drive the crusher, which could crush 15,000 catties of feed a day, which is 50 times more efficient than using a roller and more than 7 times more efficient than a hand-cranked crusher. In terms of automatization of water use, if there are bricks, use bricks to build waterways first, if there are bamboo tubes, use bamboo tubes, and if there are porcelain tubes, use porcelain tubes. This way, materials are obtained locally, construction is easy, and results are quick. Tool innovation, efficiency improvement, and labor saving. In the past, the Shimensong Pig Farm of the Shimensong Brigade of the Shimensong Commune raised 1,200 pigs, and 30 people were needed to crush the feed and 20 people were needed to carry water; now it has developed to 2,200 pigs, using electric crushers, and only 10 people are needed to crush the feed. The automatization of water use has been realized, and one person and one animal can meet the water needs for the pigs' bathing, drinking water, washing tools, steaming food, and accumulating fertilizer.

After reforming the tools and improving the efficiency, the herdsmen can spend more time studying and improving feeding techniques. The Shimensong Pig Farm of the Shimensong Brigade adopted artificial breast pumps to feed piglets, which not only made the piglets grow well, but also ensured that each breast pump could be used for heat matching of 50 sows, increasing the breeding rate by one-third. After reforming the tools, each herdsman at the Guanmenkou Pig Farm in Litai Commune raised an average of 137 pigs, and also took the time to research and develop the "four changes" adjustment method for feed, that is, coarse becomes fine, dry becomes fragrant, raw becomes cooked, and cool becomes hot, so that all the more than 1,100 pigs in the farm grew fat and strong.

    全面革新养猪技术
    群力公社不加饲养员，不增饲料地，养猪数量翻四番
    寿张县饲养工效提高四倍，劳力节省劳动强度减轻
    本报南昌4日电　群力公社全面地革新养猪各工序的工具和操作技术，实现了切碎饲料半机械化、运送饲料车子化、用水自流化、种植饲料高产化、青饲料青贮化，在生猪一年翻四番的情况下，没有增加一个饲养员，没有增加一分饲料地。
    群力公社是江西省养猪红旗——玉山县养猪最多的一个公社。到去年底为止，全社办起了养猪场一百五十一个，养猪二万五千五百多头，比去年年初翻了四番；平均每户养猪十二头，每人养三头，每亩田有猪二点四头。随着猪的数量的增多，按照常规，饲养员、饲料地也要相应增加。公社党委发动群众采取穷办法，步步革新切料、用水、运料等工序的工具和技术，提高了饲养效率四倍至八倍，解决了养猪业与农业争劳力的问题。现在，全社二百四十个饲养员，平均每人养猪已由去年年初的二十五头提高到一百零五头，而且养得很好。同时，饲料地仍是七百多亩，平均每头猪三厘地，为过去的三分之一多，完全能满足需要。
    早在去年4月间，群力公社就成立了有技术人员和铁、木工人参加的养猪技术革新委员会，党委第一书记亲自挂帅，组织全社开展养猪技术革新。首先革新花费劳力最多、效率又低的切料工具。铁木工人和技术人员创制了铡草机、切片机、刨丝机、磨粉机等十多种工具。这些工具比人工切料提高效率十来倍。一个养猪一百头至二百头的养猪场，只要一个人操纵一部机子，就可以完全解决切料的问题。现在，全社已推广各种切料机一百七十多部，实现了切碎饲料半机械化。
    接着，群力公社实现了运送饲料车子化，他们一面利用旧木料制造了一部分土车子，一面把兴修水利遗留下来的土车子、土火车和木轨道加以整修利用，沟通了各个猪圈的交通。全社已有一千五百多部饲料运输车，铺设了木轨道二千多米。每部车子一个人推，每次可运送饲料三千斤，比过去人工挑抬提高了工效三十倍。
    为了改变挑水、抬水占用许多劳力的情况，全社养猪场用毛竹做水管，用三合土砌水沟，引水进场，节省了大批劳动力。如第五生产大队的十九个养猪场，过去挑水、抬水的劳力二十七个，实现用水自流化后，由饲养员兼管就行了，原来的二十七个劳力全部转入了农业生产。
    群力公社采取了实现饲料高产化的多种措施。首先选种高产饲料作物，如蕉藕、红薯、莙达菜、萝卜等。一亩蕉藕从种到收，可以收七次茎、叶，加上块根，产量高达五万多斤。其次，实行玉米割青。在玉米嫩苗期多次割青作饲料，边割边长，亩产量可以提高到三、四万斤。再次，增加轮作次数。过去饲料地只种一季，亩产三、四千斤；现在春种莙达菜，夏种红薯或蕉藕，冬种萝卜，全年亩产达八万至十万斤，比过去提高三、四倍。由于改革了饲料作物耕作方法，去年全社播种的七百多亩饲料作物，一般亩产量达到五万斤至十万斤，比过去增加四倍至六倍。
    这个公社还大力推行饲料青贮的技术措施，实现了青饲料青贮化。过去，人工煮料，既花劳力又费燃料。现在，全社挖了青贮窖二千个，每窖青贮饲料三千斤至五千斤。青贮饲料，不仅可以直接喂猪，节省了大批煮料劳动力和燃料，还可以长期保存，供淡季需要。
    目前，群力公社正在大办新式养猪场，进一步革新养猪技术，力争实现送料、关栏自动化，同时准备利用水力作动力，逐步实现饲料加工机械化。这样，就可以用比现在更少的劳力，饲养比现在更多的生猪。
    本报济南4日电　山东省寿张县在高速度发展养猪业中，大力改革饲养工具，使全县饲养员由平均每人养猪十二头提高到六十头，提高了工效四倍。这个县1959年养猪六十七万多头，比1958年多五倍多。
    寿张县养猪事业的大发展，一度出现了占用劳力较多的现象。中共寿张县委及时发动了一个养猪工具大改革的群众运动，从去年7月到年底的半年中，创造和改良了各种养猪工具四十二种，共二万六千八百件。全县有二千九百七十三个养猪场，全部实现了饲料切碎机械化或半机械化、用水自流化、饲料和肥料运输车子化、蒸煮饲料一灶多锅化、喂养工具半自动化，大大节省了劳力。
    各级党委具体细致地领导了养猪工具改革。各社队养猪场和工厂都设立了饲养工具改革研究小组。县委先后在石门宋、台前、大布等公社召开了养猪工具改革现场会，推广了技术革新经验，还规定了奖励表扬的办法，激发了群众的积极性，四个多月共提出合理化建议四万二千多条。
    寿张县创造改革养猪工具，首先从改革饲料粉碎、用水、运输等花费劳力较多的工具入手，并采取由简单到复杂、由土到洋的办法。如饲料粉碎机，就先后创制和改革了人力、畜力、水力和电力等多种。乐镇公社养猪场，开始创造的手摇粉碎机一天可粉碎饲料二千斤，后来用柴油机带动粉碎机，一天可粉碎饲料一万五千斤，比原来用碾轧提高工效五十倍，比手摇粉碎机提高了七倍多。在用水自流化方面，有砖的就先用砖砌水道，有竹管的用竹管，有瓷管的用瓷管。这样就地取材，修建容易，收效很快。工具革新，工效提高，劳力节省。石门宋公社石门宋大队养猪场，过去养猪一千二百头，饲料粉碎需要三十人，担水需要二十人；现在发展到二千二百头猪，采用电力粉碎机，粉碎饲料仅用十人，用水实现了自流化，一人、一畜就满足了猪洗澡、喝水和洗刷工具、蒸食、积肥等的用水。
    改革工具，提高工效后，饲养员能够抽出更多的时间来研究改进饲养技术。石门宋大队养猪场采用人工哺乳器喂仔猪，不仅仔猪长得好，而且每个哺乳器能保证五十头母猪热配，提高繁殖率三分之一。李台公社关门口养猪场改革工具后，每个饲养员平均养猪一百三十七头，还抽出时间研究出饲料“四变”调剂法，即粗变细、干变香、生变熟、凉变热，使全场一千一百多头猪，头头生长肥壮。
