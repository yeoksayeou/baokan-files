    A Family of Returned Overseas Chinese
    Zhu Yake is an overseas Chinese who returned from Indonesia last year. His family consists of ten people—his wife and eight children. Before returning to China, he worked as a worker at the automobile repair shop of the Enmei Tin Mine Company in Belitung, Indonesia, where he worried about his family's livelihood all day long. After returning to China, he went to work at the automobile repair shop of the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm, a state-owned farm on Hainan Island. His wife, Fan Yulan, also participated in production at the farm's starch factory. Four of his children are attending junior high school and primary school, respectively, and the other four younger children are preparing to be sent to kindergartens and nurseries. The whole family lives a very happy life.
