Zhengzhou, January 6th (People's Daily): The Chayashan People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan Province, the first commune organization established in the province, has seized the current excellent situation and launched a thriving large-scale production campaign to strive for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960. In the first few days of the new year, the commune was bustling with activity everywhere. Red flags fluttered in the vast wheat fields, and fertilizer carts shuttled back and forth. Within five days, 77% of the land had been fertilized with a second application of topdressing. At the water conservancy construction sites, more than 10,000 water conservancy workers had already completed 780,000 cubic meters of earthwork and were working day and night to rush the construction of reservoirs and canals, preparing sufficient water sources for this year's agricultural production. In the commune's factories, machines roared, speeding up the manufacture of spring plowing tools. On the mines, explosions boomed as workers mined more underground treasures to serve construction. The entire commune also built 40 indigenous fertilizer plants and 63 pig and sheep pens, producing more than 60,000 jin of indigenous fertilizer. Various production preparations are being carried out vigorously.

Since the Chayashan People's Commune was established in April 1958, its various productions have developed significantly in the same year. In 1959, despite suffering from severe drought, it still achieved an all-round leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, as well as industrial production. The total grain output in 1959 reached more than 54.73 million jin, more than double that of 1957 before the commune was established. The grain yield per mu in 1957 was 280 jin, which jumped to 617 jin in 1959. The development of diversified operations was also rapid. The number of collectively raised large livestock increased from 8,142 to 10,068, and the number of live pigs increased from 3,000 when the commune was first established to more than 29,000. The net income from forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery increased sevenfold compared with 1957. Before the commune was established, the industry of Chaya Mountain was a blank slate. In 1959, the commune already had 34 factories, including machinery, papermaking, brick and tile, and textile factories, with a total output value of 2 million yuan. The total production value of the entire commune in 1959 was more than 7.09 million yuan, an increase of 148.3% compared with 1957. The lives of the commune members have also been greatly improved, with the average income increasing from 36.6 yuan in 1957 to 96.8 yuan.

In order to strive for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960, the Chayashan Commune Party Committee thoroughly mobilized the commune members, summarized the experiences of 1959, analyzed the current excellent situation, and greatly tapped this year's production potential. The commune members identified the favorable conditions for continuing the leap forward this year: First, after rectification, the People's Commune has further embarked on a sound and consolidated road, and the collective economy has developed rapidly. In 1959, the commune accumulated more than 1.6 million yuan of funds, plus more than 1.12 million yuan of public accumulation funds extracted from major teams. The collective economy has accounted for more than 33% of the entire commune's economy. This is a strong material foundation for developing production this year. Second, all five poor teams in the commune have caught up with the income level of the rich teams in the past year, and the entire commune can develop production in a comprehensive and balanced manner this year. Third, the entire commune has added a large number of agricultural machinery such as tractors and harvesters, taking a big step forward in realizing agricultural mechanization. Fourth, the entire commune has basically realized water conservancy. There are two medium-sized reservoirs and 20 small reservoirs, which can store 50 million cubic meters of water, ensuring disaster resistance and a good harvest. Fifth, it is rich in natural resources. The mountainous area has quartz, phosphorus, iron and other minerals, as well as a large number of white grass, cork, kudzu and other papermaking raw materials and other industrial raw materials. The plains area is rich in economic crops such as cotton and soybeans. These provide sufficient raw materials for the further development of community-run industries and diversified operations. Sixth, the entire commune also has more than 30,000 mu of low-yielding fields. As long as water and fertilizer are added, the soil is improved, and management is strengthened, great production potential can be brought into play. Seventh, through continuous socialist education movements and the fact that the commune has achieved great success over the years, the ideological awareness of commune members has been improved, the concept of "man will conquer nature" has taken deep root in the minds of commune members, and the style of daring to think and daring to act has also been greatly promoted.

Encouraged by this excellent situation, the Chayashan Commune members formulated a comprehensive leap forward plan for 1960. According to this plan, the total grain output in 1960 will increase by 30% on the basis of 1959, the yield per mu will increase from 617 jin last year to 803 jin, cotton will increase by 28% on the basis of last year, and oil crops will increase by 25%. The industrial output value is planned to reach 5 million yuan this year, accounting for 48.5% of the total industrial and agricultural output value, an increase of 1.5 times compared with last year. The output value of diversified economies is planned to reach 3 million yuan, an increase of 36% compared with last year. This year, the collective economy is planned to reach more than 60% of the total planned income of the entire commune.

    抓住当前大好形势　充分挖掘生产潜力
    嵖岈山公社新年迈开跃进步伐
    施追肥、修水利、制农具、挖矿藏、订规划，热气腾腾
    本报郑州6日电　河南省第一个建成公社组织的遂平县嵖岈山人民公社，抓住当前的大好形势，开展了如火如荼的大生产运动，争取1960年更好更全面的跃进。新年的头几天中，公社到处是一片沸腾的景象，广阔的麦田里红旗飘扬，肥车如梭，五天内，77％的地里施上了二遍追肥；在水利工地上，一万多名水利大军，已完成七十八万土方，还在昼夜赶修水库和渠道，为今年农业生产准备充足水源；公社工厂里机器轰鸣，加紧制造春耕工具；矿山上爆破声隆隆，工人们挖掘更多的地下宝藏为建设服务；全社还建起四十个土化肥厂、六十三个猪羊圈，制成土化肥六万多斤。各项生产准备工作，都在蓬蓬勃勃地展开。
    嵖岈山人民公社在1958年4月份成立后，当年各项生产就得到了显著的发展，1959年遭到严重的旱灾，仍然获得了农林牧副渔和工业生产的全面跃进。1959年粮食总产量达到了五千四百七十三万多斤，比公社化前的1957年增加了一倍多，1957年粮食单产二百八十斤，1959年就跃为六百一十七斤。多种经营的发展也很快，集体饲养的大牲畜由八千一百四十二头发展到一万零六十八头，生猪由公社初建时的三千头，发展到两万九千多头。林牧副渔的纯收入，比1957年提高七倍。公社化前，嵖4岈山的工业还是一张白纸，1959年，公社已拥有机械、造纸、砖瓦、纺织等三十四个工厂，总产值达到二百万元。全社1959年的生产总产值七百零九万多元，比1957年增长了148．3％。社员生活也大大改善，平均收入由1957年的三十六元六角增长到九十六元八角。
    为了争取1960年更好更全面的跃进，嵖岈山公社党委深入发动社员群众，总结了1959年的经验，分析了当前的大好形势，大挖今年的生产潜力。全社社员找出了今年继续跃进的有利条件：第一，人民公社经过整顿后，进一步走上了健全巩固的道路，社有经济迅速发展。1959年公社积累资金一百六十多万元，加上从各大队提取的一百一十二万多元公积金，社有经济已占全社经济的33％以上。这是今年发展生产的雄厚的物质基础。第二，全社五个穷队在去年一年已全部赶上富队的收入水平，今年全公社可以全面平衡地发展生产。第三，全社添置了拖拉机、收割机等大批的农业机械，在实现农业机械化道路上前进了一大步。第四，全社基本实现了水利化，现有两个中型水库和二十座小水库，可蓄水五千万公方，抗灾保丰收有了保证。第五，物产资源丰富，山区有石英、磷、铁等矿藏，还有大量的白草、栓皮、葛条等造纸原料和其他的工业原料，平原地区盛产棉花、黄豆等经济作物。这些都给进一步发展社办工业和多种经营提供了充足的原料。第六，全社还有三万多亩低产田，只要加水加肥，改良土壤，加强管理，可以发挥很大的生产潜力。第七，经过不断地开展社会主义教育运动和公社连年取得巨大成就的事实，提高了社员的思想觉悟，人定胜天的观念已经在社员群众中深深地扎下了根，敢想敢干的风格也得到了大大的发扬。
    在这种大好形势的鼓舞下，嵖岈山公社社员订出了1960年全面跃进的规划。根据这个规划，1960年粮食总产量要在1959年的基础上增长30％，单产由去年的六百一十七斤增加到八百零三斤，棉花在去年的基础上增长28％，油料增长25％。工业产值今年计划达到五百万元，占工农业总产值的48．5％，比去年要增长一点五倍。多种经济的产值，计划达到三百万元，比去年增长36％。今年社有经济，计划达到全社计划总收入的60％以上。
