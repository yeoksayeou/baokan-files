Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Forty thousand people from all walks of life in Tokyo held demonstrations and protest rallies this afternoon, protesting Nobusuke Kishi's trip to the United States today to sign the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Participating in the demonstrations were not only workers and students, but also women and members of various mass organizations, intellectuals, and small business owners. Approximately 3,500 representatives from all over Japan, including Okinawa Island under U.S. occupation, also participated.

The placards carried by the demonstrators read: "Kishi Nobusuke, get lost!" "The people of Asian countries will never fight again!" "Abandon the policy of hostility towards China and restore diplomatic relations with China," and so on.

The demonstrators held a mass rally in Hibiya Park, where a declaration was unanimously adopted. The declaration emphasized that the delegation led by Nobusuke Kishi, which departed this morning, does not represent the Japanese people because they run counter to the wishes of the vast majority of Japanese people who oppose the military treaty and desire peace.

The declaration protested against the Japanese government, the ruling party, and the U.S. government's revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The declaration called on the Japanese people to rise up and take action to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," and in particular, to express their firm opposition to the treaty on the day it is signed.

The declaration stated that the people participating in the mass rally are determined to fight and not succumb to oppression until the conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty" is crushed.

Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, Sanzo Nosaka, and Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, spoke at the rally.

Sanzo Nosaka said that the momentum of the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is unprecedented in Japan. He emphasized that the democratic forces should unite strongly to prevent the revised "Security Treaty" from being ratified by the Diet.

Inejiro Asanuma said that Nobusuke Kishi's sneaking off to the United States this morning proves that Nobusuke Kishi and his entourage have no self-respect or confidence.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Amidst the strong protests of the Japanese people, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, protected by thousands of armed police and many armored vehicles, sneaked into Tokyo's Haneda Airport through the back door this morning and hurriedly boarded a plane to the United States to sign the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Nobusuke Kishi and the delegation he led originally intended to leave Japan at 10:00 p.m. today, but he suddenly moved it forward to 8:00 a.m. today in an attempt to escape the protest demonstrations of the Japanese people.

Japanese police authorities deployed armed police around the airport all night starting at 8:30 p.m. yesterday, the largest scale of special alert since the airport was built. Thousands of police and hundreds of armored vehicles and trucks guarded every entrance to the airport, and some armored vehicles were placed across the roads leading to the airport.

When Nobusuke Kishi traveled from his residence to the airport, he was escorted by fifteen motorcycles and twelve trucks full of police. He dared not go through the main gate of the airport, but sneaked into the airport through the back door via a road that is rarely used. The news of Nobusuke Kishi using the back door was kept strictly confidential, and even most of the police on guard around the airport did not know.

Only a small number of government officials and ruling party leaders were at the airport to see Nobusuke Kishi off. Nobusuke Kishi quickly walked past the line of foreign diplomats who were saying goodbye to him and hurriedly boarded the plane.

Tokyo's Haneda Airport was filled with shouts of protest today. About 500 students gathered at the airport last night and held a sit-in demonstration all night, protesting Nobusuke Kishi's trip to the United States to sign the new military treaty. This morning, two hours before Nobusuke Kishi's departure, about two to three thousand university students held a protest rally near the airport in the cold rain. The police of Nobusuke Kishi's government violently beat these students and arrested seventy-eight people. However, the students still shouted in unison at the entrance of the airport: "No Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States!" "Absolutely oppose the revision of the Security Treaty!"

The road leading to the airport that Nobusuke Kishi passed was covered with slogans, which read: "Oppose the revision of the Security Treaty!" "Oppose Nobusuke Kishi's trip to the United States to sign the new Security Treaty!" "Down with the reactionary Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet!" "Strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China!" "Conclude a Japan-Soviet peace treaty!"

After Nobusuke Kishi sneaked away in a panic on the plane, the demonstrating students held demonstrations and protest rallies in the rain again. They expressed their determination to fight to the end to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

News said that the scale of today's protests and demonstrations against Nobusuke Kishi's signing of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" was larger than the protests against former Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida's departure to the United States in 1951 to sign the one-sided San Francisco "Peace Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's act of sneaking off to the United States this morning under the protection of 6,000 police to sign the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty has aroused condemnation and ridicule from the Japanese public.

The Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today saying that the "plenipotentiary delegation" led by Nobusuke Kishi secretly departed for the United States under police protection, which symbolizes that the revised "Security Treaty" is doomed to a bad end.

The statement went on to say that the Socialists will concentrate their efforts on preparing so that Kishi Nobusuke will not be able to get the Diet to approve the new treaty.

Tonight's "Sankei Shimbun" published an interview with commentator Ayako Ishigaki. She said that nothing could be more shameful than such a situation! A country's prime minister has to leave his country under police protection because he does not have public support.

Commentator Soichi Oya said in the same newspaper that Nobusuke Kishi's behavior was like an "illegal immigrant"; he pointed out that the reason why Nobusuke Kishi could not depart openly was because his policies were unpopular.

Another bourgeois newspaper, the "Mainichi Shimbun," also said today that Nobusuke Kishi's departure today was "too sad for a country's prime minister." (Attached picture)

    日本人民誓死反对日美军事同盟
    东京四万人示威集会反对岸信介去签字
    卖国首相在几千武装警察保护下狼狈溜往美国
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本各界四万人今天下午在东京举行示威和抗议大会，抗议岸信介今天前往美国签订日美军事同盟条约。
    参加示威的不仅有工人和学生，还有妇女和各群众团体的成员，知识分子和小企业主，来自日本各地、包括在美军占领下的冲绳岛的代表共约三千五百人也参加了示威。
    示威者抬着的标语牌上写着：“岸信介，滚你的蛋！”“亚洲各国人民决不再打仗！”“放弃敌视中国的政策，同中国恢复邦交”等等。
    示威者在日比谷公园举行了群众大会，会上一致通过了宣言。宣言强调指出，今天早晨出发的岸信介率领的代表团不代表日本人民，因为他们同反对军事条约、希望和平的绝大多数日本人民的意愿背道而驰。
    宣言表示抗议日本政府、执政党和美国政府修改日美“安全条约”。宣言号召日本人民群起采取行动来阻止修改“安全条约”，特别要在条约签字的这一天表示坚决反对这个条约。
    宣言说，参加群众大会的人决心进行斗争，不向压迫屈服，直到修改“安全条约”的阴谋被粉碎为止。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三和社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎在会上讲了话。
    野坂参三说，反对日美“安全条约”的斗争声势之强大在日本是史无前例的。他强调民主力量坚强地团结起来，使经过修改的“安全条约”无法在国会得到批准。
    浅沼稻次郎说，岸信介今天早晨偷偷前往美国，这证明岸信介及其随从毫无自尊和自信。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介今天早晨在日本人民的强烈抗议声中，由数千名武装警察和许多装甲车保护，偷偷从后门溜进东京羽田机场，仓皇乘飞机前往美国签订日美军事同盟条约。
    岸信介和他率领的代表团原来打算在今天晚上十点钟离开日本，但是他突然提前到今天早晨八点钟动身，企图逃避日本人民的抗议示威。
    日本警察当局从昨天晚上八点半开始就出动武装警察通宵在飞机场周围部署了这个机场修建以来最大规模的特别戒备。数千名警察和数以百计的装甲车、卡车守卫在机场的各个入口，还有一些装甲车横在通往飞机场的公路上。
    岸信介从住所到机场的时候，有十五辆摩托车和十二辆载满警察的卡车护送。他不敢走飞机场的大门，通过一条平时很少使用的道路，从后门偷偷地溜进了飞机场。岸信介走后门的消息事先严格保密，甚至连在机场周围站岗的大多数警察都不知道。
    在飞机场上欢送岸信介的只有政府官员和执政党首脑等少数人。岸信介很快地走过同他告别的外国外交官的行列，匆匆忙忙地上了飞机。
    东京羽田机场今天到处都是抗议的吼声。约有五百名学生从昨天晚上就聚集在飞机场，通宵举行静坐示威，抗议岸信介前往美国签订新的军事条约。今天早晨，在岸信介动身前两个小时，约有两、三千名大学生冒着寒冷的雨在机场附近举行了抗议大会。岸信介政府的警察凶暴地殴打这些学生，并且逮捕了七十八人。但是，学生们仍然在机场门口齐声高呼：“不许岸信介访问美国！”“绝对反对修改安全条约！”
    岸信介所经过的通往机场的路上贴满了标语，上面写道：“反对修改安全条约！”“反对岸信介到美国签订新安全条约！”“打倒反动的岸信介内阁！”“争取恢复日中邦交！”“缔结日苏和约！”
    在岸信介狼狈地乘飞机溜走以后，示威的学生们又冒雨举行了示威游行和抗议大会。他们表示，决心为阻止修改“安全条约”斗争到底。
    消息说，今天反对岸信介签订新日美“安全条约”的抗议和示威的规模，比1951年反对日本前首相吉田茂动身到美国签订片面的旧金山“和约”时还要大。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介今天早晨在六千名警察的保卫下偷偷溜往美国签订日美军事同盟条约的行径激起了日本公众的谴责和嘲骂。
    日本社会党中央执行委员会今天发表声明说，岸信介率领的“全权代表团”在警察保护下偷偷地启程前往美国，这种行径象征着修改后的“安全条约”注定没有好下场。
    声明接着说，社会党人将集中力量作好准备，使岸信介无法使国会批准新条约。
    今晚的“产经新闻”刊载了评论家石垣绫子的答记者问。她说，没有什么事情比这样一种情况更丢人了！一个国家的首相由于得不到公众的支持，不得不在警察保护之下离开自己的国家。
    评论家大宅壮一在同一家报纸上说，岸信介的行径像“非法的移民”；他指出，岸信介之所以不能光明正大地启程，是因为他的政策不得人心。
    另一家资产阶级报纸“每日新闻”今天也说，岸信介今天动身的情况“对一个国家的首相来说真是太可悲了”。（附图片）
