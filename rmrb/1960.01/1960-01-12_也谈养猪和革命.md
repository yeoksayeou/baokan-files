    More on Pig Raising and Revolution
    Jiao Hewen

    "One pig per mu is a magnificent aspiration."
    Think: One pig per mu, one pig is a fertilizer factory. Let's say each pig produces 20,000 jin of fertilizer per year. How much fertilizer will we get? Therefore, how much grain production can we increase? Think: How many kinds of industrial raw materials are on each pig? If agriculture develops, how many kinds of raw materials will be added to industry, and how big a market will be opened up? How much benefit will our socialist construction cause? Think: One pig per mu, assuming an average of three mu of land per person, how much more income can each person increase each year? How much more pork can each person eat per day? Think: What the predecessors did not discover or recognize, we have discovered and recognized; what the predecessors did not dare to realize, we have started to do and are about to realize. What a great spirit this is!
    "One pig per mu is a tremendous task."
    Think: Pigs will be on every mu, how many more pigs will there be? Each pig needs a sty, how many more sties need to be built? They need to be fed at every meal, how much feed is needed? Of course, this does not mean that the aspiration of one pig per mu can be realized unconditionally. There are conditions. More pigs must be born from pigs. One litter has ten, two litters have a hundred, three or four litters will have tens of millions. The land is a fixed number, waiting for the number of pigs to catch up. Pigs reproduce exponentially. How can it be said that one pig per mu cannot be realized?! If there are not enough sties, people will build them. The commune has a large population and great strength, which is different from the individual economy of single households. If there is not enough feed, start looking for it, "Pigs eat hundreds of kinds of grass, let's see if you can find it." The earth is full of weeds, all of which are pig food; corn stalks can be made into starch, people can eat it, and pigs can eat it even more; the leaves of a tree are enough for a pig to eat for a month, there is plenty of feed, how can it be said that there is no source of feed?! Of course, this does not mean that realizing one pig per mu requires no effort at all, and it can be changed in an instant. Although there are conditions, a tremendous amount of work must be done.
    To realize the magnificent aspiration of one pig per mu, a tremendous amount of work of one pig per mu is required. The aspiration of one pig per mu and our current reality are like being separated by a river. To realize this aspiration, we must row the boat across the river. Have you seen, now, there are two kinds of people standing on the bank of this river. One kind of person is not afraid of difficulties, and bravely faces them, like Xinle County in Hebei, the first to realize the aspiration of one pig per mu; the other kind of person is afraid of the waves capsizing the boat and afraid of exerting effort and sweating. Cowardice and laziness are combined, and the word "difficult" is at the forefront. How can one pig per mu be realized?
    Therefore, we say: Two roads for two kinds of people.
    One is: Establish the view that pigs are the head of the six domestic animals, take the road of one pig per mu, more pigs, more manure, more grain, more meat, more income, accelerate socialist construction, achieving several goals at once.
    The other is: Use the views of the ancestors, considering pigs as the last of the six domestic animals, take the road of having land without pigs or having more land and fewer pigs, fewer pigs, less manure, less yield, losing the high-speed development of socialist construction, losing on several fronts.
    Having the revolutionary worldview of the working class, believing in the Party and the strength of the collective, will therefore lead to full confidence, courage, and unwavering determination on the road to building socialism, cutting through thorns and overcoming all difficulties; harboring the cowardly bourgeois worldview will be blinded by difficulties, unable to see various favorable conditions, unable to see various great strengths, and will therefore lose confidence, be alarmed, and retreat in the face of difficulties.
      "One pig per person, one pig per mu," it is not only a magnificent aspiration, but also a tremendous task. This is another example of our country's daring to think and act on the road of socialist construction, a vigorous and revolutionary cause.

    也谈养猪和革命
    焦合文
    “一亩地一头猪，是宏伟的志愿”。
    你想：一亩地一头猪，一头猪一个造肥厂，按每头猪一年积肥两万斤算吧，我们能得多少肥？因此能增产多少粮？你想：每一头猪身上有多少种工业原料？农业发展了，又给工业增加多少种原料，开辟多大市场，我们的社会主义建设事业将因此得到多大好处？你想：一亩地一头猪，按每人平均三亩地算吧，每人一年平均可以增加多少收入；每人每天可多吃多少猪肉？你想：前人没有发现的，认识的，我们发现了，认识了；前人没有敢实现的，我们动手做起来，要实现了，这又是多么大的气魄？
    “一亩地一头猪，是巨大的工作”。
    你想：亩亩有猪，猪要猛增多少头？猪猪要圈，又需建多少圈？顿顿喂食，要吃多少饲料？当然，这不是说，一亩地一头猪的志愿是无条件实现的，条件是有的，猪多要由猪来生，一辈生十个，两辈生百个，三辈四辈就上千万。地呀是死数，单等猪数赶，猪生猪是倍倍翻，怎说一亩一猪不能实现！？圈少有人来建，公社人多力量大，不同于单干个体经济。饲料少，动手找，“猪吃百样草，看你找不找。”大地百草丛生，俱是猪食；玉米秸作淀粉人能吃猪更能吃；一棵树上的树叶也够一只猪吃一月的，饲料多得很，怎说饲料无来源！？当然，这也不是说，实现一亩一猪不费吹灰之力，刹那之间一变就有。条件虽有，但要去作巨大的工作。
    实现一亩一猪的宏伟志愿，需作一亩一猪的巨大工作。一亩一猪的志愿和我们目前的现实，好比隔着一条河，要实现这个志愿，就得摇桨过河。你看见没有，现在，站在这条河边上的有两种人，一种人不惧困难，见难勇上，像河北新乐县，第一个实现了一亩一猪的志愿；另一种人既怕波浪翻船，又怕费力出汗，胆小和手懒加在一起，“难”字当头，一亩一猪哪能实现。
    因此，我们说：两条道路两种人走。
    一条是：确立猪为六畜之首的观点，走一亩地一头猪的道路，猪多粪多粮多，肉多，收入多，加速社会主义建设，一举数得。
    一条是：用老祖宗的看法，猪为六畜之末，走有地无猪或地多猪少的道路，少猪少粪少产量，失去了社会主义建设事业的高速度发展，一步数失。
    具有革命的工人阶级世界观，既相信党，又相信集体力量，因此，就会在建设社会主义的征途上信心百倍，勇往直前，披荆斩棘，排除万难；怀着懦夫的资产阶级世界观，就会被困难障目，看不见各种有利条件，看不到各种巨大力量，因此，便要丧失信心，大惊小怪，遇难而退了。
      “一人一头猪，一亩一头猪”，它既是宏伟的志愿，又有巨大的工作，这是我国在社会主义建设道路上敢想敢干的又一范例，是一项轰轰烈烈的革命事业。
