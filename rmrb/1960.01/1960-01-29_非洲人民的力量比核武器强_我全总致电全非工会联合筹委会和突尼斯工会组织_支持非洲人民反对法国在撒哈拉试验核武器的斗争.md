Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent a telegram to the Preparatory Committee of the All-Africa Trade Union Federation, supporting the just struggle of African workers and people against French nuclear weapons testing in the Sahara region.

The telegram stated that the French government, disregarding the strong opposition of the African and world people, brazenly announced that it would conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara region. Chinese workers are deeply憤慨 about this and firmly support the just struggle of African workers and people against this test.

The telegram pointed out that the French government's action is a serious provocation against the African national independence movement and world peace. It attempts to threaten the heroic African people and continue to maintain its criminal colonial rule. The awakened African people cannot be intimidated. Their strength is thousands of times stronger than nuclear weapons. With the support of the people of the world, the struggle of African workers and people against imperialism and colonialism will surely achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent a telegram to the Tunisian General Labour Union, supporting the just struggle of the Tunisian and other African people against French nuclear weapons testing in the Sahara and demanding the withdrawal of French troops from Tunisia.

The telegram stated that Chinese workers express their firm support for the actions of Tunisian and other African workers and people protesting against the French testing of atomic bombs in the Sahara, and for your actions demanding the withdrawal of French troops from Tunisia. It condemns the French colonialists for using the Sahara of the African people to carry out criminal nuclear tests that endanger the African people, and the aggressive act of French troops unreasonably stationed in Tunisia. The imperialists must get out of Africa. No matter what means they adopt, they cannot save the dying fate of colonialism. We warmly support the heroic struggle of the African people and wish the Second All-African People's Conference, which is being held in Tunisia, will contribute to this struggle.

    电报指出，法国政府这一行动是对非洲民族独立运动和世界和平的严重挑衅，它妄图以此威胁英勇的非洲人民，继续维持其罪恶的殖民统治。已经觉醒了的非洲人民是吓不倒的，他们的力量比核武器强大千百倍。非洲工人和人民反对帝国主义与殖民主义的斗争，在世界人民的支持下，一定能够取得最后胜利。
