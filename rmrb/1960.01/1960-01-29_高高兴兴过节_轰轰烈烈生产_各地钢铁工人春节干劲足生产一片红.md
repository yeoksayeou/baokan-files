Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 28th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) employees are maintaining production during the Spring Festival, and many factories completed their production plans for the first two shifts very well today.

The First Steelmaking Plant held an on-site broadcast conference for exchanging technical innovation experiences as soon as its employees came to work today, promoting the advanced experiences of each furnace. The workers of No. 4 open-hearth furnace used advanced experiences such as high-temperature rapid furnace repair and layered burn-through charging in production, which shortened the smelting time of the first batch of steel during the Spring Festival by more than two hours compared to the plan. Wang Wenduo, an assistant in the No. 2 open-hearth furnace, created a new method of applying the front wall, which extended the life of the front wall by two to three times compared to the past.

Wang Chonglun, a nationally renowned innovation expert and deputy director of the tool workshop of the Northern Machinery Repair Plant, went to the site last night to fight alongside the workers. He used the new type of jig he had just successfully created in production, which resulted in a fifteen-fold increase in the efficiency of processing mineral processing filters.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th: Shanghai steel industry employees, who continue to maintain production as usual during the Spring Festival, have made new achievements today under the slogan of "Swear to turn the festival into a day of high production." Xu Shunxing's steelmaking team in the open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant worked even harder than usual today, producing 104 tons of high-quality steel in eight hours, exceeding the shift plan by 14 tons, with a quality pass rate of 99.5%. The First Branch of New Shanghai Steel Plant, which had overfulfilled its January plan by eight and a half days ahead of schedule, began to roll turbine blades in batches today, which are technically quite complex, after thorough preparation in the previous days. With the close cooperation of the three work sections, the shift output reached more than 34 tons, exceeding the shift plan by 1.65 times.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th: On the first day of the Spring Festival, employees of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company and eleven steel enterprises including Beijing Steel Plant, Beijing Special Steel Plant, Shahe Iron Smelting Plant, and Dahongmen Steel Rolling Plant continued to maintain production as usual. As of press time, they have excellently completed the production plans for the first two shifts.

Today, the first two shifts of smelting workers at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled their plans. In order to win the victory in production on the first day of the Spring Festival, the converter steelmaking workers held a competition meeting before the shift and launched a technical performance competition. The first two shifts produced 31 tons of steel more than planned, and the steel's qualification rate reached more than 99%, and completed the monthly steel output plan ahead of schedule today. The production of blast furnaces is also very good. The No. 2 blast furnace overproduced 74 tons of pig iron in the first two shifts.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 28th: The employees of Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant, who continued to maintain production as usual during the Spring Festival, achieved excellent results in production today. The steel output of the first shift exceeded the plan by 15.6%, and the qualified rate of steel ingots exceeded the plan by 1.2%.

In order to achieve a complete success in Spring Festival production, the factory established a Spring Festival Production Command Headquarters before the Spring Festival, led by the Party Secretary, to lead all employees in carrying out in-depth technical performance competitions. Today, the attendance rate of the entire factory in the first shift reached 99%, and only one of the more than 800 workers in the steelmaking workshop was absent.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 28th: Chongqing iron and steel and coal mine workers, who continued to maintain production as usual during the Spring Festival, reported good news during the festival today; the shift output of many steel plants and coal mines in the first two shifts exceeded the average level in January, and some even created new records.

Workers from Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant have been holding a joint technical performance campaign to tackle key issues since the 26th. The open-hearth steelmaking plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel, which had already overproduced more than 2,400 tons of steel in the first 27 days of January, created a new record of repairing the furnace once every two minutes at the beginning of the first shift of the Spring Festival. The workers of the Zhongshan Hall converter plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company organized a "one-dragon" model worker performance today, and the quality of steel has improved by more than 30% compared with the first seven days of late January.
