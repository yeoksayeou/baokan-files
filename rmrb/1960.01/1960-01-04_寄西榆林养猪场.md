    Sent to the Xiyulin Pig Farm
    Zou Difan
    I hear the sound of firecrackers, and the wintersweet blossoms in the ice and snow.
    I remember the first year of the Great Leap Forward, when we first went to the countryside.
    The moon flies through the clouds, and the carts rumble through the wind and sand.
    Under the moonlight, I suddenly see a white wall,
    That is the Xiyulin Pig Farm.
    The spring breeze of peach and plum blossoms has passed for a year, and I can't forget the heroic pig farm.
    I remember the head of the commune saying:
    "No pigs have ever been raised outside the Great Wall, only sheep have been grazed.
    Chairman's order resounds throughout the world:
    Cooperatives must raise pigs!
    We are all brave, only because our minds are greatly liberated.
    We learned from Yanggu County, the home of Wu Song who fought the tiger, and brought back the experience to raise pigs.
    'Self-breeding and self-raising' is a high ambition, 'Collective breeding and household raising' is a strong force..."
    Let people laugh and say: "A food-deficient commune raising pigs is like a clay bodhisattva crossing the river [doomed to fail]",
    Your entire commune is mobilized, pig feed is everywhere,
    In the fields, in the ponds,
    In the valleys, on the trees,
    Pigs eat hundreds of kinds of grass, as long as people look for them!
    One point of breakthrough, ten thousand horses gallop,
    Every family builds pigsties, every household is beaming with joy.
    In spring, prevent the wind, in summer, it is hard to bear the heat,
    Around the pig farm, you plant green willows and weeping poplars.
    In all seasons, prevent plagues, at night, prevent wolves,
    One hand learns to inject, the other hand picks up a rifle.
    Outside the Great Wall it's thirty degrees below zero, ice and snow are no different from marble;
    We can't let the piglets get cold, so we put the piglets on warm kang [heated brick bed].
    Everyone talks about a good year,
    More pigs, more fertilizer, more vigor in the crops,
    A food-deficient commune becomes a surplus-grain town,
    The spring breeze is proud, and people change their clothes...
    Last year, the commune celebrated its establishment, and the "囍" [double happiness] character was pasted on every pen.
    "We must report good news to every commune team,
    Guarantee the supply of piglets to all villages!"
    The new cause spreads its wings for thousands of miles,
    New pigsties are built, and pig farms are expanded,
    Large sows are full of pregnancies, and small piglets are all strong...
    When I pass the pig farm again,
    I only see everyone is busy,
    Hearing the music of suckling pigs oinking,
    I know this is a warm house for pigs.
    Another year of spring breeze, peach and plum blossoms,
    The sound of firecrackers, the fragrance of wintersweet,
    In your place,
    The feeders hold hot feed,
    Like holding a pot of flowers,
    Manure is more fragrant than wintersweet!
    What you are doing is socialism,
    The great cause is in your hands!
    One piglet is not small,
    Each one is a treasure chest of socialism!
    Red light shines on the pig farm!

    寄西榆林养猪场
    邹荻帆我听着爆竹声响，腊梅在冰雪中吐香。记起跃进第一年，我们第一次下乡。月亮在云中飞走，大车在风砂中滚响，月光下猛见到一带白粉墙，那正是西榆林养猪场。春风桃李一年过，我难忘英雄的养猪场。记得社长这样讲：“塞外没养过猪，只知放放羊。“主席的号令天下响：合作社要把猪养！我们一身都是胆，只因思想大解放。“从打虎武松的阳谷县，学回经验把猪养。‘自繁自养’志气高，‘社繁户养’力量强……”让人们嘲笑说：“缺粮社养猪是泥菩萨过江”，你们全社总动员，猪饲料到处都是，在田头、在池塘，在山谷、在树上，猪吃百种草，只要人去找！一点突破，万马齐上，家家垒猪圈，户户喜洋洋。春天啦防风，夏天热难当，养猪场周围，你们种绿柳垂杨。四季呀防瘟，黑夜呀防狼，一只手学会注射，一只手拿起火枪。塞外零下三十度，冰雪跟大理石无两样；不能让小猪受寒呀，把小猪放上暖炕。一年好景人人讲，猪多肥多庄稼劲头大，缺粮社变成余粮乡，春风得意人换装……去年公社庆成立，囍字贴在每座圈上。“要给公社队队都报喜，保证仔猪供给各村庄！”新事业展翅万里航，新建猪圈，扩大猪场，大母猪胎胎饱满，小仔猪个个健壮……当我再过养猪场，只见人人在奔忙，听到乳猪呜呜的音乐，我知道这是群猪的暖房。春风桃李又一年，爆竹声响，腊梅飘香，在你们那里啊，饲养员捧着热腾腾的饲料，像捧着盆花一样，粪肥比腊梅更香！你们干的是社会主义，伟大事业就在你们手上！一头小猪不算小，头头都是社会主义的百宝箱！养猪场上放红光！
