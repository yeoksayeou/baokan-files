In the triumphant songs of the Great Leap Forward, China's working class enters the first year of the 1960s. On the first day of the new year, good news of an auspicious start came from factories and mines in Beijing, Shanghai, Anshan, Fushun, Karamay, and the Greater Khingan Range. A great situation of an auspicious start and complete success in 1960 is unfolding before us. This is a harbinger of continued leap forward in 1960.

"Strive to be red to the end in 1959 and have an auspicious start in 1960." This is the battle cry put forward by China's working class several months ago. Under this slogan, China's working class completed and overfulfilled the 1959 plan ahead of schedule with high output, high quality, variety, low cost, and safety, so that China's industrial and transportation production and construction in 1959 took another Great Leap Forward on the basis of the 1958 Great Leap Forward. We have perfectly achieved "red to the end in 1959," and now we are fighting with full confidence for "an auspicious start in 1960." Our goal is not only an auspicious start, but also a complete success and red to the end. The so-called auspicious start, complete success, and red to the end, from a national perspective, means that the average daily output of various enterprises, industries, and regions in the first quarter of this year should not be lower than or slightly higher than the level of the fourth quarter of last year, and on this basis, steadily increase to achieve monthly red and quarterly red, establish and consolidate the new norm of continuous and stable production increases, and completely change the old "norm" that production at the beginning of the month, quarter, and year is always lower than at the end of the previous month, quarter, and year; it is not only necessary to achieve red in output, but also to achieve red in quality, variety, cost, and safety, and a comprehensive leap forward. Complete success—a comprehensive leap forward—is the key to continuing the leap forward in 1960, because output, quality, variety, cost, and safety are interrelated and promote each other. Only when each enterprise achieves high output, good quality, variety specifications that meet requirements, low cost, and safety at the same time can production continue to increase steadily, and can the high tide of the increasing production and practicing economy movement be continuously pushed to new peaks.

The objective situation for achieving an auspicious start, complete success, and red to the end in 1960 is very good. The Great Leap Forward in the past two years has eloquently proved that the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, as well as a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, is indeed a line and policy that combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of China's construction, which profoundly reflects the objective laws of China's economy and concentrates the urgent desire and strong will of the Chinese people to change the "poor and blank" face. The two years of the Great Leap Forward have also created relatively strong material and technical forces for China. Under the encouragement of the slogan of technological revolution, the technical level of many enterprises has been improved, and the technical team is growing. The vast number of cadres and workers have accumulated many valuable experiences in the great practice of the past two years. With these experiences, we can more deeply understand and more consciously implement the Party's General Line and a complete set of policies of walking on two legs, and we can play a greater role in socialist construction with greater enthusiasm and creativity. We have the material and technical conditions created by the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, and we also have the political and ideological conditions created by the deep understanding of the Party's General Line, thus laying the foundation for the high-speed, proportional, and sustained leap forward of the national economy, creating the most basic conditions for an auspicious start, complete success, and red to the end this year.

Early preparations for the production in the first quarter of this year have also created extremely favorable conditions for an auspicious start, complete success, and red to the end. Chairman Mao told us not to fight unprepared battles. In order to fight well in the first quarter of this year, after the National Industrial Production Conference in October last year, all departments, regions, and major enterprises began to arrange the production plan for the first quarter of this year while striving to be red to the end in 1959. By the end of 1959, many enterprises had organized cadres and workers to fully discuss the production in the first quarter of this year, organized workers to speak out freely, debate extensively, and put up big-character posters. The idea of striving for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960 and striving for an auspicious start, complete success, and red to the end in 1960 has been established among the vast number of workers. On the basis of doing a good job in political and ideological work, various enterprises quickly grasped various specific tasks in material, technical, and organizational aspects. In terms of materials, many enterprises have stored sufficient raw materials, materials, and semi-finished products for the production in the first quarter or January. In terms of technology, many enterprises have carried out mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements according to new tasks, improved product design, improved equipment and tools, organized technical performance competitions, summarized and promoted various advanced experiences, improved the technical level of workers, and overhauled equipment in advance. In terms of organization, many enterprises have formulated new process regulations, new process operation lines, prepared design drawings, and adjusted labor organization in advance. Such early, detailed, and comprehensive production preparations have not been done in the past. With such full preparation, we can take the initiative from the beginning of the year to achieve an auspicious start and complete success in the first quarter of production, and we will be able to further establish a new norm of stable production increases. We have made all preparations for the production in the first quarter in advance, and we have won the initiative in the first quarter, so we have the conditions to prepare for the production in the second, third, and fourth quarters in advance, and win the initiative in the second, third, and fourth quarters.

The current excellent situation and favorable subjective and objective conditions have enabled us to achieve an auspicious start from the beginning of 1960. In the future, to maintain an auspicious start, complete success, and red to the end every month and every quarter, we still need to do a lot of work, and we still need to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. Things are always developing in the struggle of contradictions. No one can foresee all the specific problems that may arise in the development of production. In the future, when preparing for the production in the second, third, and fourth quarters, we may still encounter various difficulties. Even in achieving a complete success in the first quarter of production, all cadres and workers still need to go all out to solve many specific problems, and cannot be blindly optimistic. We must analyze the situation calmly at all times, see both the favorable factors and the potentially unfavorable factors; we must grasp it tightly from the beginning to the end, and we cannot be negligent or slack at any moment. We must continue to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution and carry out mass movements with technical innovation and technical revolution as the central content. Only by mobilizing the masses and continuously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution can we quickly and effectively overcome various contradictions in the development of production and continuously carry out the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy.

1960 is a year to strive for a better and more comprehensive leap forward on the basis of the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years, and the current situation is also a situation of a better and more comprehensive leap forward. At the beginning of the new year, workers in Beijing, Shanghai, Anshan and other places have played the first victorious movement for this year's continued leap forward. Let us go all out with revolutionary fervor and throw ourselves into the battle of an auspicious start, complete success, and red to the end, and move forward bravely towards the great goals of 1960.

### 开门红　满堂红　红到底

    开门红　满堂红　红到底
    我国工人阶级在高奏大跃进的凯歌声中进入二十世纪六十年代的第一年——1960年。开年的第一天，开门红的喜讯就从北京、上海、鞍山、抚顺、克拉玛依、大兴安岭等地的厂矿企业传来。1960年一派开门红、满堂红的大好形势展现在我们面前。这是1960年继续跃进的预兆。
    “争取1959年红到底，1960年开门红”，这是我国工人阶级几个月以前提出来的战斗口号。在这个口号下，我国工人阶级高产、优质、多品种、低成本和安全地提前和超额完成了1959年的计划，使我国1959年工业交通的生产和建设，在1958年大跃进的基础上再来一个大跃进。我们已经完满地实现了“1959年红到底”，现在正满怀信心地为“1960年开门红”而奋斗。我们的努力目标不但是开门红，而且还是满堂红、红到底。所谓开门红、满堂红、红到底，从全国范围来说，就是要各个企业、各行各业、各个地区今年第一季度的平均日产量，不低于或略高于去年第四季度的水平，并在这个基础上稳定上升，实现月月红，季季红，建立和巩固生产不断地稳定上升的新常规，彻底改变月初、季初、年初生产总比上月末、上季末、上年末低的旧“常规”；不但要做到产量红，而且同时做到质量、品种、成本和安全样样红，全面跃进。满堂红——全面跃进，是1960年继续跃进的关键，因为产量、质量、品种、成本和安全，是互相联系着、促进着的。每个企业只有在高产的同时，又做到质量好，品种规格合乎要求，成本低和安全，生产才能不断稳定上升，才能把增产节约运动高潮不断地推向新的高峰。
      实现1960年开门红、满堂红、红到底，客观形势是非常好的。过去两年的大跃进，雄辩地证实了，党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，以及一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，的的确确是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国建设的具体实践相结合的路线和方针，既深刻地反映了我国经济的客观规律，又集中地反映了我国人民改变“一穷二白”面貌的迫切愿望和坚强意志。两年的大跃进又给我国造就了比较强大的物质技术力量。在技术革命的口号的鼓舞下，许多企业的技术水平都已提高，技术队伍正在成长。广大干部和职工群众在两年来的伟大实践中积累了许多宝贵的经验。我们有了这些经验，就能够更深刻地认识和更自觉地执行党的总路线和一整套用两条腿走路的方针，也就能够在社会主义建设中发挥更大的积极性和创造性。我们有了由两年连续大跃进所创造的物质和技术条件，又有由于党的总路线深入人心而造成的政治和思想条件，因而就奠定了国民经济发展的高速度的按比例的持续跃进的局面，为今年开门红、满堂红、红到底创造了最基本的条件。
    提早进行今年第一季度的生产准备工作，也给开门红、满堂红、红到底创造了极为有利的条件。毛主席告诉我们不要打无准备之仗。为了打好今年第一季度这一仗，去年10月间全国工业生产会议以后，各部门、各地区、各主要企业都在争取1959年红到底的同时，开始布置今年第一季度的生产计划。到1959年年底，许多企业都组织干部和职工群众充分讨论了今年第一季度的生产，组织职工群众大鸣、大放、大辩论，贴大字报。争取1960年更好更全面的跃进，争取1960年开门红、满堂红、红到底的思想，已经在广大职工群众中树立起来。在做好政治思想工作的基础上，各个企业迅速地抓紧了物质上的、技术上的和组织上的各项具体工作。在物质方面，许多企业都已经为第一季度或1月份生产储备了充足的原料、材料、半成品。在技术方面，许多企业都根据新的任务开展了群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，改进产品设计，改进设备和工具，组织技术表演竞赛，总结和推广各种先进经验，提高工人的技术水平，并提前检修了设备。在组织方面，许多企业都提前制定了新的工艺规程、新的工艺作业线，准备了设计图纸，调整了劳动组织。这样早、这样细致、这样全面地进行生产准备工作，是过去所没有的。有了这样充分准备，我们就能够在年初一开始就掌握主动，实现第一季度生产的开门红和满堂红，就一定能够进一步建立生产稳定上升的新常规。我们提前做好了第一季度生产的各项准备工作，争得了第一季度的主动，我们就有条件提前做好第二、第三、第四季度的生产准备工作，争得第二、第三、第四季度的主动。
    目前的大好形势和有利的主观、客观条件，使我们从1960年初就实现了开门红。今后要在月月、季季坚持开门红、满堂红、红到底，还要靠我们去作许多的工作，还要靠充分发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性。事物永远在矛盾的斗争中发展着。无论什么人，都不可能预见到生产发展中可能出现的一切具体问题。在将来进行第二、第三、第四季度的生产准备工作，还有可能会遇到这样或那样的困难。就是在实现第一季度生产的满堂红中，也仍然需要全体干部和职工鼓足干劲去解决许许多多的具体问题，丝毫不能盲目乐观。必须时时刻刻冷静地分析形势，既看到有利的因素，又看到可能出现的不利的因素；我们必须一开始就抓紧，自始至终抓紧，一刻也不能麻痹松懈。我们必须继续发扬不断革命论的精神，大搞以技术革新和技术革命为中心内容的群众运动。只有发动群众，不断地进行技术革新和技术革命，才能迅速地有效地克服生产发展中出现的各种矛盾，把增产节约群众运动持续地开展下去。
    1960年是在过去两年连续大跃进的基础上争取更好更全面跃进的一年，目前的形势也是更好更全面跃进的形势。新年伊始，北京上海鞍山等地职工，已经为今年的继续跃进奏出了胜利的第一曲。让我们鼓足革命干劲投入开门红、满堂红、红到底的战斗，向着1960年伟大的目标勇往直前。
