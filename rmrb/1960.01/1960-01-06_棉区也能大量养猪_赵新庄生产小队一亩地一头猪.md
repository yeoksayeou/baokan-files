　　Cotton-Growing Areas Can Also Raise a Large Number of Pigs
　　Zhao Xinzhuang Production Team Raises One Pig Per Mu
　　This production team broke the old habit of not raising pigs in cotton-growing areas, using cotton leaves, cotton shells, and cotton seed cake to raise pigs in large quantities. In just over ten months, the number of pigs increased from 68 to 410.

　　Due to the large increase in manure fertilizer, grain and cotton yields also increased greatly in 1959, with grain yielding 1,100 jin per mu and cotton yielding 600 jin of unginned cotton per mu. At the same time, with the increase in pig manure, the use of chemical fertilizers decreased, and production investment was relatively reduced.

　　The Zhao Xinzhuang Production Team in Linqing City, Shandong Province, is a contracted unit of the Liming Brigade of the Lao Zhao Zhuang Commune. This is a cotton-producing area. The team has 45 households, 196 people, and 406 mu of cultivated land, with cotton fields accounting for 65%. After communization, under the leadership of the Party, the team set ambitious goals and broke the habit of not raising pigs in cotton-growing areas, using simple methods to raise pigs in large quantities. In just over ten months, the number of pigs increased from 68 to 410, a tenfold increase compared to before communization, reaching an average of more than nine pigs per household, achieving one pig per mu. A new situation of more pigs, more fertilizer, more meat, more grain, and more cotton emerged.

　　Cotton Leaves and Cotton Shells are Good Feed

　　Historically, the team's grain supply relied on the state. Fertilization for grain and cotton relied entirely on commercial fertilizers (chemical fertilizers, bean cake, and dried manure), and even most of the native and miscellaneous fertilizers had to be purchased from Linqing City, resulting in large production investments. Based on the opinions of the masses, the Party branch decided to vigorously launch a pig-raising and manure-collecting campaign. Convinced that the path of pig-raising and manure-collecting was correct, the Party branch resolutely mobilized the masses to raise pigs in large quantities, raising the questions of "Does cotton-growing area need to raise pigs in large quantities?" and "Is there a way to solve the feed problem?" among all commune members for extensive debate. The masses calculated comparative accounts of the costs and yields of commercial fertilizers versus pig-raising and manure-collecting, and many facts proved the benefits of pig-raising and manure-collecting. Everyone unanimously agreed to raise pigs in large quantities. Thus, a leadership group for pig-raising and manure-collecting was established, led by the Party branch secretary, and the pig-raising and manure-collecting campaign was launched in conjunction with production.

　　In solving the feed problem, they used methods such as collecting, planting, processing, and storing to widely gather feed. They used cotton flower ears, branches, tops, cotton leaves, calyxes, picked cotton seedlings, corn seedlings, cotton shells, cotton seed cake, etc., as feed. To encourage commune members to collect feed in large quantities, they adopted methods of grading and pricing, recording work points, and cash purchases. By mid-October 1959, they had collected 340,000 jin of various coarse feeds such as tree leaves, vegetables, aquatic plants, bran, chaff, dry sweet potato vines, and corn stalks, and ensiled 70,000 jin of corn stalks and sweet potato vines. In 1959, the team also planted 80 mu of corn and sweet potatoes, and reclaimed 15 mu of wasteland at the village head to plant carrots. In addition, there were distiller's grains, sugar dregs, starch dregs, slurry dregs, etc., enough to feed more than 400 pigs for a year. They learned from the experience of the Shimen Song Commune in feed preparation and processing, fully implementing fermentation, making it into mash, steaming, boiling, and stir-frying to make it fragrant, soft, and fine, improving feed utilization, and mastering the method of mixing various feeds to make the pigs like to eat and gain weight quickly.

　　Self-Breeding and Self-Raising

　　In solving the pig source problem, the Party branch accepted the lesson of buying more than 20 piglets from outside in the winter of 1958, which all died, and decided to adopt the method of self-breeding and self-raising. Thus, all the original small sows and newborn gilts were retained and strengthened, and four improved breed pigs were purchased for self-mating and self-breeding. Branch committee member Liu Weiqin was specifically responsible for this work, and experienced commune members who were enthusiastic about pig-raising were selected as farm managers and inseminators. They quickly mastered advanced methods such as estrus induction, estrus promotion, early mating, multiple mating, double mating, and continuous mating, so that all sows of breeding age were fully pregnant, with an average litter size of 13 piglets, and as many as 20 piglets, achieving full mating, full success, full production, and full survival. In one year, self-breeding and self-raising produced more than 260 piglets in addition to 82 sows. To implement the policy of "public raising and private raising going hand in hand, with public raising as the main and private raising as the supplement," the commune adopted methods such as exchanging work points, exchanging feed, and exchanging fertilizer to help commune members raise one or two pigs per household. With more pigs, there were not enough pens. Leading cadres and Party members took the lead, borrowing 250 purlins in three days. Without reed mats, everyone went to the lake to cut reeds, and quickly built 54 pigsties. When there were not enough feed jars, commune members voluntarily lent 15 large jars, solving the problem of feed storage.

　　More Pigs, More Fertilizer, Continuous Increase in Cotton and Grain Production

　　With more pigs and more fertilizer, the amount of fertilizer applied increased year by year, from 9,000 jin per mu in 1958 to 19,000 jin in 1959. In 1958, the average grain yield per mu was 732 jin, and the average cotton yield per mu was 300 jin of unginned cotton; in 1959, the grain yield per mu was 1,100 jin, and the cotton yield per mu was 600 jin of unginned cotton. Grain and cotton yields increased greatly, but costs decreased. In 1958, 28 jin of chemical fertilizer was applied per mu, plus manure fertilizer, totaling 10.1 yuan; while in 1959, 12 jin of chemical fertilizer was applied per mu, plus manure fertilizer, totaling 9.5 yuan, reducing fertilizer costs by 0.6 yuan per mu, while the grain yield per mu increased by 368 jin, and the cotton yield increased by one time. The commune members unanimously praised the good growth of crops in 1959. Old commune member Hao Lianhan said: "The cotton bolls are like eggs, and the cotton flowers are like snowflakes." With the increase in grain and cotton production, public accumulation expanded, and commune members' income increased. In 1959, the total income from grain, cotton, and other diversified economies was 73,800 yuan. After deducting public accumulation, the average income per person was more than 100 yuan, an increase of 40 yuan compared to 1958. In the past, grain relied on state supplies. This year, 19,000 jin of surplus grain was sold, 40,000 jin of grain was reserved, and 7,000 jin of surplus grain was distributed. In 1959, the state assigned this team a task of six fat pigs. By the end of October, 25 pigs had been completed, more than three times the task. During the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Harvest Celebration, the team slaughtered seven pigs, and the commune members ate more meat than in previous years.

　　Encouraged by the policy of "taking pigs as the key link, promoting the prosperity of livestock, and comprehensively developing animal husbandry production," this team has also made a new plan for developing animal husbandry: in 1960, the total number of pigs in the team will be increased to 842, striving for 1,000, ensuring two pigs per mu; draught animals will be increased from 13 to 27, averaging one head per 15 mu; sheep will be increased from 65 to 196, averaging one per person; chickens will be increased from 209 to 1,100, averaging six per person; rabbits will be increased to 392.

    棉区也能大量养猪
    赵新庄生产小队一亩地一头猪
    这个生产小队打破了棉区不养猪的旧习惯，采用棉叶、棉壳、棉子饼大量养猪，仅十个多月的时间，猪由六十八头增加到四百一十头。
    由于粪肥大量增加，1959年粮棉产量也大大提高，粮食亩产一千一百斤，棉花亩产籽棉六百斤。同时，猪粪增加了，化学肥料就减少了，生产投资也相对降低了。
    山东临清市赵新庄生产小队是老赵庄公社黎明大队的一个包产单位。这里是棉产区。全队四十五户，一百九十六人，耕地四百零六亩，棉田占65％。公社化后，在党的领导下，立雄心树大志，打破了棉区不养猪的习惯，用穷办法大量养猪。十个多月的时间，猪由六十八头增加到四百一十头，比公社化前增加十倍，平均每户九头多，达到了一亩地一头猪。出现了猪多、肥多、肉多、粮多、棉多的新气象。
    棉叶棉壳是好饲料
    历来这里的口粮靠国家供应。粮棉施肥全靠商品肥料（化肥、豆饼、大粪干），就是土杂肥大部也要到临清市内去购买，生产投资很大。党支部根据群众意见，决定大量开展养猪积肥运动。党支部确信养猪积肥这条道路是正确的，便坚决发动群众大量养猪，提出了“棉区需不需要大量养猪？”“饲料有没有办法解决？”在全体社员中开展大辩论。群众算了商品肥料和养猪积肥成本、产量高低的对比账，许多事实证明了养猪积肥的好处，大家一致同意大量养猪。于是以支部书记为主成立养猪积肥领导小组，结合生产开展了养猪积肥运动。
    在解决饲料问题上，他们使用了采集、种植、加工、贮藏等办法，广泛搜集饲料。把棉花打下的耳子、杈子、顶心、棉叶、棉萼、拣掉的棉苗、玉米苗和棉壳、棉籽饼等作饲料。为鼓励社员大量收集饲料，采用了分等论价、记工分和现金收购的办法。到1959年10月中旬已收集各种树叶、菜、水草、糠、秕、干地瓜蔓、玉米秧等粗饲料三十四万斤，玉米秸、地瓜蔓青贮七万斤。1959年队里还种了八十亩玉米和地瓜，并开垦村头荒地十五亩，种上胡萝卜。另外，还有酒糟、糖渣、粉渣、浆渣等，足供四百多头猪一年食用。学习了石门宋公社饲料调制加工的经验，全部作到了发酵、变糟、蒸、煮、炒，使其变香、变软、变细，提高了饲料利用率，并掌握了各种饲料混喂的方法，使猪爱吃、上膘快。
    自繁自养
    在解决猪源方面，党支部接受1958年冬向外购买二十多头仔猪死光的教训，决定采用自繁自养的办法。于是把原有几头小母猪和新生的小母猪全部保留，加强饲养，买了四头良种猪自配自繁。支委刘维勤具体负责这项工作，选出养猪热心有经验的社员充当场长、配种员，很快地掌握了诱情、催情、早配、多配、双重配、连续配等先进方法，使适龄母猪全部满怀，产仔量平均达到十三头，多者达二十头，作到全配、全准、全产、全活。一年来自繁自养，除母猪八十二头外，仔猪已达二百六十多头。为贯彻“公养和私养同时并举，以公养为主、私养为辅”两条腿走路的方针，公社将繁殖的仔猪，采取换工分、换饲料、换肥料等办法，帮助社员每户养一到二头猪。猪多了圈不够用，党员干部带头，三天借出檩条二百五十根，没有席箔大家下湖割苇草，很快盖好了五十四间猪舍。饲料缸不够，社员主动借出了十五个大缸，解决了贮料困难。
    猪多肥多，棉粮连年增产
    猪多肥多，施肥量逐年增加，1958年每亩施肥九千斤，1959年增到一万九千斤。1958年粮食平均亩产七百三十二斤，棉花平均亩产籽棉三百斤；1959年粮食亩产一千一百斤，棉花平均亩产籽棉六百斤。粮棉产量大大提高，但成本费用降低了，1958年每亩施化肥二十八斤，加圈肥合十元一角；而1959年每亩施化肥十二斤，加圈肥合九元五角，肥料费每亩降低六角，粮食亩产量却提高三百六十八斤，棉花产量提高了一倍。社员们一致赞扬1959年庄稼长的好，老社员郝连汉说：“结的棉桃像鸡蛋，开的棉花像雪片。”随着粮棉增产，公共积累扩大了，社员收入增加了。1959年粮棉多种经济总收入七万三千八百元，除留公共积累等以外，每人平均分配收入一百多元，比1958年增加四十元。过去粮食靠国家供应，今年卖余粮一万九千斤，储备粮四万斤，还分了超产粮七千斤。1959年国家分配这个队的肥猪任务是六头，10月底已完成了二十五头，超任务三倍多。端阳节、中秋节、庆丰收时，队里杀了七头猪，社员也比往年多吃了肉。
    在“以猪为纲、六畜兴旺、全面发展畜牧生产”方针的鼓舞下，这个队又作了新的发展畜牧业计划：1960年，全队猪发展到八百四十二头，争取一千头，保证每亩地两头猪；耕畜由十三头发展到二十七头，每十五亩地合一头；羊由六十五只发展到一百九十六只，每人平均一只；鸡由二百零九只，发展到一千一百只，每人平均六只；兔发展到三百九十二只。
