Shandong
(Our dispatch from Jinan, January 20th) Shandong's winter wheat management is solid and enthusiastic. According to statistics from mid-January, of the province's 67.9 million mu of winter wheat, over 55.27 million mu have been top-dressed, accounting for 81.4% of the wheat field area. Recently, Liaocheng, Jinan and other regions have launched major inspections of wheat field management. Licheng County discovered 16,200 mu of wheat fields where top-dressing did not meet standards, and quickly supplemented them with refined and meticulous fertilizer. In terms of preventing and controlling wheat rust, various localities are eradicating it as they discover it. In order to solve the shortage of medicines and machinery, many places are using the method of pouring human urine and spraying ammonium sulfate solution, which has a very good effect.
People's communes have particularly strengthened the management of high-yield fields and third-class seedlings. The province's 25 million mu of large-area high-yield fields have been carefully managed by special personnel from sowing to the present. In Jinan City, each commune adopts the method of "five to the fields" for high-yield plots: leading cadres, professional teams, output targets, local fertilizer factories, and pig farms. Zhucheng County in Changwei Prefecture launched a competition movement for creating high-yield bases at all levels, and everyone creating high-yield fields. There are 12,000 cadres above the level of small team leader and more than 200,000 commune members participating in the county, creating more than 5,000 large and small high-yield plots, covering approximately 510,000 mu.
Communes in various localities are seizing the management of third-class seedlings, and have proposed to eliminate third-class seedlings before they turn green. Various counties in Liaocheng Prefecture have conducted universal inspections, and then fixed specific personnel to take charge and eliminate them within a time limit. Of the area's 1.62 million mu of third-class seedlings, 1.29 million mu have been supplemented with nourishment by means of watering human urine and top-dressing with meticulous fertilizer. After processing and management, 90,000 mu of Shou Zhang County's 130,000 mu of third-class seedlings have been upgraded.
In order to connect winter management and spring management and ensure that wheat passes each stage well, advanced units in various localities have launched a competition initiative to "resolutely break through the greening stage and vow to win a great wheat harvest," calculating the water and fertilizer accounts for wheat greening and stepping up preparations for water and fertilizer.

Henan
(Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 20th) Commune members in various parts of Henan Province are not afraid of wind, snow, or severe cold. They are vigorously irrigating wheat fields with freezing water and universally applying warm seedling fertilizer to ensure that wheat passes the winter well. To date, the vast majority of wheat fields in the province have been top-dressed once or twice, and some have been top-dressed three times. Wheat fields that have been irrigated with freezing water account for 78% of the planned irrigation area. According to the wheat seedling ranking in various places, third-class wheat seedlings account for about 15% of the province, but these seedlings are growing better than the second-class seedlings in the same period last year.
In order to ensure that wheat seedlings grow more vigorously, party organizations at all levels have led the masses to overcome the paralyzing idea of some cadres who believe that wheat was planted early and managed well, and can be harvested without further processing, through field inspections and comparisons. After inspection and comparison, Yexian County found that the quality of fertilization and watering in some wheat fields was not good enough, and a small number of distant fields had not been fertilized. The county party committee immediately put forward the slogan "No mu should be missed during topdressing, and every field should be thoroughly watered," making wheat field management work more meticulous. Party committee secretaries at all levels in Xiangcheng County have established experimental fields for transforming third-class seedlings into first-class seedlings, creating experience and guiding the overall situation. In just half a month, 32,000 mu of the county's 42,000 mu of third-class seedlings have been upgraded.
Various localities have paid attention to coordinating water conservancy construction, pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, tool reform, and wheat field management. Kaifeng Prefecture, which has always been arid and short of water, has adopted the method of using rivers, canals, pits, ponds, and wells together, and converging waterwheels, machinery, and crane winches in water conservancy construction. It has winter-irrigated more than 18 million mu of wheat, making it the province's fastest-progressing prefecture in winter wheat irrigation. Nearly 20,000 of the 30,000 newly built canals, wells, reservoirs, and pits and ponds in Nanyang Prefecture since the beginning of winter have exerted irrigation benefits, enabling more than 1.4 million mu of wheat fields that had no irrigation conditions in the past to be irrigated. Many places have also established pig farms in wheat fields, enabling distant fields that have not been fertilized for years to be fertilized. In order to accelerate the progress of wheat field management, various localities have vigorously carried out tool reform for wheat field management. Shangqiu, Xinye, Linyu, and Baofeng counties have vigorously promoted field transportation tracks, which have significantly improved fertilizer transportation efficiency.

Hebei
(Our dispatch from Tianjin, January 20th) The wheat management movement, with the aim of welcoming the wheat greening stage, has been universally launched in various parts of Hebei, with 2 million laborers invested in wheat field management. According to statistics on January 12, the province had already top-dressed 26.63 million mu, accounting for 82% of the total wheat field area; winter irrigation reached 17.32 million mu, accounting for 88% of the wheat fields that should be irrigated.
The characteristics of wheat field management in Hebei Province are: vigorously grasping high-yield plots, focusing on low-yield fields, and striving for a great harvest in all wheat fields. At present, the province's wheat high-yield plots have reached 15.5 million mu, accounting for 48% of the total wheat field area. Due to priority management and special care, all wheat in high-yield plots has achieved universal irrigation and universal top-dressing, with an average of 10,000 to 15,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. The wheat seedlings in high-yield plots have basically reached the first class, with an average of 700,000 to 800,000 plants per mu, and more than 1.2 million plants in some areas. In order to further strengthen the management of high-yield plots, various localities are vigorously carrying out basic construction within the plots, establishing archives for each plot, establishing red and expert schools and technical research organizations, training technicians, and improving the scientific management level of the plots. In the large-area high-yield plots in Anguo County, "five groups" (agricultural cultivation technology research group, comparison test group, meteorological observation group, seed breeding group, and agricultural tool reform group) and one laboratory (soil testing laboratory) scientific and technological organizations have been universally established.
While vigorously grasping high-yield plots, we are also vigorously grasping second-rate wheat and eliminating low-yield fields. In Baoding and Tangshan, the method of spreading sand to suppress alkali is commonly used in alkaline wheat fields, which has played a great role in preventing alkali and protecting seedlings. For third-class wheat seedlings, generally increase water, increase fertilizer, increase measures, and implement a series of methods such as leadership contracting, commune members contracting, and establishing a responsibility system. To date, the province has eliminated 1.65 million mu of third-class seedlings.

Shanxi
(Our dispatch from Taiyuan, January 20th) People's communes in wheat-producing areas of Shanxi Province carefully manage overwintering wheat, making the province's more than 16 million mu of winter wheat seedlings full, strong, deeply rooted, and leafy.
At present, more than 15.64 million mu of wheat in the province have been universally applied with one to two top-dressings, accounting for 96.5% of the winter wheat area, with an average fertilizer application rate of 45 dan per mu, and the fertilizer application area has expanded five times compared to the same period last year. More than 2.78 million mu have been winter-irrigated, accounting for 98.1% of the water-irrigated wheat fields, an increase of 2.5 times compared to the same period last year. Wheat fields that have been rolled, compacted, and harrowed have reached more than 15.38 million mu, accounting for 95% of the total wheat field area, an increase of more than 11 times compared to the same period last year. Prevention and control were carried out in a timely manner on 330,000 mu of wheat seedlings suffering from rust. After such careful management, the province's wheat fields generally show a scene of sufficient fertilizer, saturated moisture, full seedlings, vigorous seedlings, and many tillers. According to agricultural departments' investigations and rankings in various places, first-class wheat fields account for 55% of the total wheat field area, second-class wheat fields account for 38% of the total area, and third-class wheat fields account for only 7% of the total area.
In wheat field management, each commune has adopted the method of "walking on two legs" by vigorously launching mass movements and establishing professional field management teams, so that the labor force participating in wheat field management in the province has consistently maintained at around 1.5 million people. In terms of management methods, the method of establishing large-area high-yield plots on one hand and grasping the management of low-yield fields (returning stubble fields and barren land) on the other hand is universally implemented, so that irrigated and dry land, good and bad land, and returning stubble wheat and normal stubble wheat advance side by side and develop in a balanced manner. The province has established a total of 6 million mu of large-area wheat high-yield plots and high-yield experimental fields. 50% of these high-yield fields have achieved gardenization, and generally, signs are inserted in each plot and archives are established. Management work such as top-dressing, watering, disease control, and pest control are done more meticulously, reaching high standards.
Recently, in response to the current drought and the occurrence of rust in some wheat fields, wheat-producing areas have launched a high-standard wheat field management movement centered on watering, fertilizing, and processing, striving for every mu of wheat field to be free of insects, diseases, weeds, soil crusting, and third-class seedlings.

Shaanxi
(Our dispatch from Xi'an, January 20th) The broad masses of people in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province have launched a competition movement to seize a great wheat harvest, accelerating the progress and improving the quality of wheat overwintering management. As of the 19th of this month, the 4.98 million mu of wheat fields in this area that can be irrigated have all been irrigated for the first time, and 1.76 million mu have been irrigated for the second time. All 16.9 million mu of wheat fields (Weibei Plateau and some mountainous areas) in the area have been top-dressed for the first time, 7.69 million mu have been top-dressed for the second time, and 1.02 million mu have been top-dressed for the third time. 1.55 million mu-times have been treated for rust disease; 8.77 million mu have been weeded, and 10.2 million mu have been harrowed.
This competition movement was rapidly launched after the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to the people of the province to strengthen the agricultural front in every possible way and strive for a bumper harvest of the first crop this year. Pucheng County, whose first crop of wheat last year exceeded the total grain output of the entire year of 1958, has once again set ambitious goals and issued a letter of proposal to fraternal counties and cities in the Guanzhong area on New Year's Day this year to launch a wheat bumper harvest competition. Pucheng County's proposal was immediately enthusiastically responded to by counties and cities in Guanzhong, and a winter wheat management competition movement between counties, communes, and production teams quickly launched.
The competition movement has greatly promoted the current wheat overwintering management work. On the first day after launching the competition with Pucheng County, Xingping County irrigated more than 27,000 mu of wheat fields and applied top-dressing fertilizer to more than 59,100 mu of wheat fields. In response to the drought and water shortage in wheat fields, Dali County organized a professional team of 30,000 people to repair and irrigate simultaneously, so that 150,000 mu of the 170,000 mu of newly expanded water fields this winter and spring were winter-irrigated.

    北方五省大抓丰产方消灭低产田
    精心护理小麦越冬
    普遍追施暖苗肥　及时浇灌封冻水　迅速消灭麦锈病
    山东
    本报济南20日电　山东冬小麦管理扎扎实实，热气腾腾。据1月中旬统计，全省六千七百九十万亩冬小麦，追肥五千五百二十七万余亩，占麦田面积的81．4％。最近，聊城、济南等地区开展麦田管理大检查。历城县发现一万六千二百亩追肥不合规格的麦田，很快补上精肥、细肥。在防治麦锈病方面，各地随查随灭。为了解决药械不足，很多地方采用浇人尿和喷硫铵水的办法，效果很好。
    各人民公社特别加强了对丰产田和三类苗的管理。全省两千五百万亩大面积丰产田，从播种到现在，始终有专人精心管理。济南市各公社对丰产方采用领导干部、专业队、产量指标、土化肥厂、养猪厂等“五到田”的办法加强管理。昌潍专区诸城县掀起层层搞丰产基地，人人搞丰产田的竞赛运动，全县参加搞丰产田的小队长以上干部一万二千人，社员二十多万人，共搞大小丰产方五千多个，约五十一万多亩。
    各地公社抓紧对三类苗的管理，纷纷提出把三类苗消灭在返青以前。聊城专区各县通过普遍检查，随即固定专人包干负责，限期消灭。全区一百六十二万多亩三类苗，采取浇人尿、追细肥的办法，已有一百二十九万亩得到补养。寿张县十三万亩三类苗，加工管理后，已有九万亩升了级。
    为了把冬管和春管连接起来，保证小麦关关过好，各地先进单位发起了“坚决突破返青关，誓夺小麦大丰收”的竞赛倡议，纷纷计算小麦返青用水用肥账，加紧准备水、肥。
    河南
    新华社郑州20日电　河南省各地社员不畏风雪严寒，大浇麦田封冻水，普施暖苗肥，保证小麦过好越冬关。到目前止，全省绝大部分麦田已经追肥一次到两次，有的追肥三次。浇过封冻水的麦田占计划浇麦面积的78％。据各地麦苗排队，全省第三类麦苗占15％左右，但这些麦苗都比去年同期的二类苗长得好。
    为了保证麦苗生长更加健旺，各级党组织都领导群众，通过田间查比，克服了部分干部认为小麦种得早，管得好，不继续加工也能丰收的麻痹思想。叶县经过查比后，发现有部分麦田施肥、浇水质量不够好，少数远田未施肥，县委立即提出“追肥亩亩不漏，浇水块块浇透”的口号，使麦田管理工作做得更细致。襄城县各级党委书记都建立了三类苗变一类苗的试验田，创造经验，指导全面。在短短的半个月内，全县四万二千多亩三类苗，有三万二千亩升了级。
    各地都注意使水利建设、养猪积肥、工具改革和麦田管理工作互相配合。一向干旱缺水的开封专区在水利建设中，采取河渠、坑塘、井、库齐用和水车群、机械群、吊杆辘轳群汇流的办法，已冬浇小麦一千八百多万亩，成为全省小麦冬浇进度最快的一个专区。南阳专区入冬以来新修的三万处渠、井、水库和坑塘，已有近两万处发挥了灌溉效益，使一百四十多万亩过去没有灌溉条件的麦田得到了灌溉。许多地方还在麦田里建立养猪场，使历年不施肥的远田也施了肥。为了加快麦田管理的进度，各地都大搞麦田管理工具改革。商丘、新野、临汝、宝丰等县大搞田间运输轨道，使运肥效率显著提高。
    河北
    本报天津20日电　以迎接小麦返青关为内容的小麦管理运动，已在河北各地普遍展开，投入麦田管理的劳动大军达二百万人。到1月12日统计，全省已有二千六百六十三万亩追了肥，占麦田总面积的82％；冬灌达一千七百三十二万亩，占应灌麦田的88％。
    河北省麦田管理的特点是：大抓丰产方，狠抓低产田，力争全部麦田大丰收。目前，全省小麦丰产方已达到一千五百五十万亩，占麦田总面积的48％。由于优先管理，特殊照顾，丰产方的小麦全部实现普浇水，普追肥，平均每亩追肥一万至一万五千斤，丰产方的麦苗基本上达到了一类，平均每亩七十至八十万株以上，多者达到一百二十万株。为了进一步加强丰产方麦的管理，各地在方内大力进行基本建设，方方建档案，成立红专学校和技术研究组织，训练技术员，提高方田的科学管理水平。安国县的大面积丰产方里，普遍建立了“五组”（农业耕作技术研究组、对比试验组、气象观测组、种子培育组、农具改革组）、一室（土壤化验室）的科学技术组织。
    在大抓丰产方的同时，也大抓次麦，消灭低产田。保定和唐山两个地区，对碱地麦田普遍采取铺沙压碱的办法，对防碱保苗起了很大的作用。对三类麦苗，一般都增水、增肥、增措施，并实行了领导包片、社员包块和建立责任制等一系列的办法。到目前为止，全省已消灭三类苗一百六十五万亩。
    山西
    本报太原20日电　山西省产麦区各人民公社精心管理越冬小麦，使全省一千六百多万亩冬小麦苗全苗壮，根深叶肥。
    目前全省有一千五百六十四万多亩小麦普遍施了一至二次追肥，占到冬麦面积的96．5％，每亩平均施肥量达到四十五担，施肥面积比去年同期扩大了五倍。有二百七十八万多亩进行了冬浇，占水地麦田98．1％，比去年同期扩大了二点五倍。经过磙、压、耙的麦田达到一千五百三十八万多亩，占全部麦田面积的95％，比去年同期扩大了十一倍多。对三十三万亩发生锈病麦苗及时进行了防治。经过这样的精心管理，全省麦田普遍出现肥足、墒饱、苗全、苗旺、分蘖多的景象。据各地农业部门调查排队，一类麦田占到麦田总面积的55％，二类麦田占到总面积的38％，三类麦田只占总面积的7％。
    各公社在麦田管理中，都采取了大搞群众运动和建立田间管理专业队伍“两条腿走路”的方法，使全省参加麦田管理的劳力经常保持在一百五十万人左右。在管理方法上，普遍实行了一面建立大面积高额丰产方，一面抓低产田（回茬田和瘠薄地）的管理方法，使水地和旱地、好地和坏地回茬麦和正茬麦齐头并进，平衡发展。全省共建立起六百万亩小麦大面积丰产方和高额丰产试验田，这些丰产田有50％实现了园田化，一般都做到了块块插牌，建立档案。追肥浇水灭病除虫等管理工作都做得更加细致，达到了高标准的要求。
    最近，产麦区针对当前旱象露头、部分麦田发生锈病等情况，展开了以浇水、加肥、加工为中心的高标准的麦田管理运动，力争麦田亩亩无虫、无病、无草、无板结、无三类苗。
    陕西
    本报西安20日电　陕西省关中地区的广大人民，掀起夺取小麦丰产的竞赛运动，使小麦越冬管理工作进度加快，质量提高。截至本月19日，这个地区能够灌溉的四百九十八万亩麦田已经全部灌完了第一次水，灌过第二次的有一百七十六万亩。全区一千六百九十万亩麦田（渭北高原和部分山地）已全部施完第一次追肥，施过第二次的有七百六十九万亩，施过第三次的有一百零二万亩。防治锈病一百五十五万亩次；除草八百七十七万亩，耙耱一千零二十万亩。
    这个竞赛运动是在中共陕西省委向全省人民发出千方百计加强农业战线，力争今年第一料庄稼大丰收的号召后，迅速开展起来的。去年一料小麦超过1958年全年粮食总产量的蒲城县，又立下了雄心壮志，在今年元旦向关中地区各兄弟县市发出开展小麦丰产竞赛的倡议书。蒲城县的倡议，立即得到关中各县、市的热烈响应，一个县与县、公社与公社、生产队与生产队之间的麦田越冬管理竞赛运动，迅速地开展起来了。
    竞赛运动大大推动了当前的麦田越冬管理工作。兴平县在和蒲城县开展竞赛后的第一天，就灌溉麦田二万七千多亩，给麦田施追肥五万九千一百多亩。大荔县针对麦田干旱缺水的情况，组织了三万人的边修边灌的专业队伍，使去冬今春新扩大的十七万多亩水地，有十五万亩得到了冬灌。（附图片）
