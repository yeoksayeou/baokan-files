Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: Many factories, mines, and basic construction sites across the country saw workers spend their New Year's Eve and the first day of the Spring Festival engaged in joyful labor. Party, administrative, and trade union leaders from these units went to the sites to express their regards to the workers who were maintaining production and to work alongside them. Relevant departments prepared abundant food and diverse entertainment programs for the workers to enjoy the festival.

In the steel capital of Anshan, iron and steel workers who continued production during the Spring Festival spent New Year's Eve and the first day of the lunar year at the blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and rolling mills alongside Yang Chunfu, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee who came to Anshan to express greetings, as well as leading comrades from the Anshan Municipal Party Committee, the Anshan Municipal People's Committee, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and various factories and mines. Party and government leaders of Baotou, along with the Baogang慰问 team and artistic troupes, also continuously arrived at the construction site on the first day of the new year to warmly慰问 the workers and staff who persisted in production and construction during the Spring Festival. Workers at the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant, who were on duty from New Year's Eve to the morning of the first day of the new year, broke through the sub-item operation plan and created a new record. The time spent on repairing the No. 1 open-hearth furnace, loading cold materials, and transferring molten iron was reduced by half compared to the shortest time in the past. Just after midnight on New Year's Eve, the factory Party committee sent a newly-written red congratulatory letter to the workers to wish them a happy Spring Festival. Thousands of workers of various ethnic groups, including Han, Miao, Buyi, Dong, Yi, Shui, and Hui, at the Guiyang Iron and Steel Plant were immersed in joy during the Spring Festival. The Guiyang Municipal Party Committee, the Guiyang Municipal People's Committee, and the Municipal Ethnic Affairs Commission all sent慰问 groups. Workers at the Fushun Laohutai Mine who persisted in production underground beat gongs and drums before going down the mine to express their determination to develop more "black gold" for the motherland. When they came out of the mine, they set off firecrackers to announce their outstanding production achievements. At the Qingtongxia Yellow River water conservancy construction site, from morning to night on the first day of the new year, the sounds of gongs and drums and firecrackers never ceased. People followed traditional customs, performing dragon dances, land boat dances, stilt walking, and Yangko dances on the construction site and in the dormitory squares. The engineering bureau's Party committee organized a慰问 group to慰问 the workers who persisted in working during the festival.

Many professional theatrical troupes and amateur worker-artists also went to the sites to perform for the workers who persisted in production. The artistic troupes of Anshan City and the amateur theatrical troupes of various factories and mines performed excellent programs for the workers at the production sites on New Year's Eve and the first day of the new year. In the Baogang welfare area, workers on vacation saw the film "Prairie Morning," created by Mongolian writer Malaqinfu and others, and the dramas "Red Flag Story," "Subduing Dragons and Tigers," and "Flying Together," performed by the Central Academy of Drama, for the first time during the Spring Festival. On New Year's Eve, the leading organs of Fushun City sent the Fushun Pingju Opera Troupe to perform "Wildfire, Spring Breeze, Fighting the Ancient City" for the miners. After performing above the mine, the artistic performance team went underground to perform for the workers who persisted in production, and also delivered the mine's two thousand New Year's cards to various work surfaces underground. The mine's canteens and shops prepared 240,000 dumplings, fifteen kinds of cooked food, and more than fifty kinds of non-staple food, set up stalls at the pit entrances, and delivered food underground, so that the workers who persisted in production underground could happily celebrate the Spring Festival.
