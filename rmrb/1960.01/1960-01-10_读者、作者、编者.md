    Not Intermittent
    After reading Comrade Zhang Pei's article "This is Also a Law" on the seventh page of the December 25th edition of last year, I felt that there was one point worth discussing. In the article, when discussing the law of class struggle, it said: "In the process of socialist construction, the struggle between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview, fluctuating in intensity and appearing intermittently, is a reflection of the law of class struggle in the transitional period..." Although the intensity of class struggle varies in different periods during the transitional period, class struggle always exists because classes have not been eliminated. This point was pointed out by Chairman Mao in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and has been repeatedly proven in the revolutionary practice of socialist countries. Describing the class struggle in the ideological field during the transitional period as "intermittent" does not conform to the actual situation of class struggle during the transitional period and can easily cause confusion in understanding.

    The reader's opinion is correct. It is inaccurate to use "intermittent" to describe the current situation of class struggle in our country. Therefore, the original sentence should be corrected to "fluctuating in intensity."

    Happy to Read Articles by Grassroots Cadres
    Recently, the People's Daily has successively published articles written by grassroots Party committee cadres from various places, some on agriculture, some on industry, and some on other aspects. Because the authors of these articles personally participate in the leadership of grassroots work and personally experience the development and changes of a region, the articles they write are vivid, true, and persuasive. I hope to publish some more often.

    We have paid attention to increasing articles in this area. The eighth page has also opened a "Party Committee Secretary's Notes" column, constantly publishing this type of article.

    "Knowledge Vignettes" Leave a Deep Impression
    The "Knowledge Vignettes" on the eighth page of the People's Daily introduce scientific knowledge in production and construction, daily life, physiology and hygiene, and natural phenomena to readers in a popular style, which is very attractive. For example, the "Will Modern Apes Become Humans?" published on the eighth page of the December 9th edition of last year used the form of crosstalk to profoundly and simply discuss why modern monkeys cannot become humans, leaving a deep impression after reading. This type of knowledge vignette can cultivate readers' interest in scientific knowledge and increase scientific knowledge. I hope to see them often in the future.

    Attention Should Be Paid to the Coordination of Photos and News
    The news in the People's Daily is often accompanied by some photos, which are very popular with readers. However, sometimes some photos are not well coordinated with the news. For example, the news on the third page of the December 2nd edition about Guangxi's reform of manure accumulation methods was accompanied by a photo of workers from the Yankou Reservoir of Yiting Commune in Yiwu County, Zhejiang, using earthen cranes and winches to transport soil. Another example is the news on December 5th about the Houjianshanzi Party Branch of Yi County, Liaoning Province, conducting education on thriftiness for its members, which was accompanied by a photo of commune members of the Caojiabao Production Team of Xiaoxia Commune in Xining City, Qinghai, being mindful of saving despite the harvest. Although the themes are the same, the effect would be better if photos from the same region could be used.

    The readers' opinions are very good. In general, news should try to use photos of the same content or the same region to coordinate with it. We will pay attention to this issue in the future. At the same time, news photos can also be published separately and do not necessarily have to be published in conjunction with text reports. Editor

    并不是时断时续
    读了去年12月25日七版张沛同志的“这也是规律”一文，觉得有一处值得商榷。文中谈到阶级斗争的规律时说：“在社会主义建设过程中，无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的斗争，高一阵低一阵时断时续地反复出现，正是过渡时期阶级斗争规律的反映……。”过渡时期的阶级斗争，虽然激烈程度各个时期有所不同，但由于阶级并未消灭，阶级斗争总是存在的。这一点，毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中曾经指出过，在社会主义国家的革命实践中也反复得到证明。文中把过渡时期思想领域内的阶级斗争说成是“时断时续”，既不符合过渡时期阶级斗争的实际情况，也容易造成认识上的混乱。

    读者的意见是正确的。用“时断时续”来形容我国当前的阶级斗争形势，是很不确切的。因此原文中这句话应改正为“高一阵低一阵地反复出现”。

    喜读基层干部的文章
    最近人民日报上陆续发表了一些各地基层党委干部写的文章，有农业方面的，有工业方面的，也有其他方面的。这些文章的作者由于亲自参加基层工作的领导，亲身经历了一个地区的发展变化，因此写的文章生动、真实，富有说服力。希望能经常发表一些。

    我们已注意增加这方面的文章。八版并已辟设了“党委书记手记”专栏，不断发表这一类文章。

    “知识小品”给人印象深
    人民日报八版上的“知识小品”，以通俗的笔调向读者介绍生产建设、日常生活、生理卫生以及自然现象中的科学知识，很吸引人看。例如去年12月9日八版上登的“现在的猿猴会不会变人？”采用了相声的形式，深入浅出地谈了现代猴子为什么不能变成人的道理，读后给人的印象很深。这类知识小品能够培养读者对科学知识的兴趣，增加科学知识。希望以后常常有。

    照片和新闻应注意配合
    人民日报上的新闻，常常配合一些照片，很受读者的欢迎。但有时有些照片和新闻配合的不够好，如去年12月2日三版广西改革积肥方法的新闻，下边配的却是浙江义乌县义亭公社岩口水库民工用土起重机和卷扬机运土的照片。又如12月5日辽宁省义县后尖山子党支部向社员进行勤俭持家教育的新闻，配的是青海西宁市郊小峡公社曹家堡生产队社员丰收不忘节约的照片。虽然主题相同，但如能配上同一地区的照片，效果就会更好。

    读者的意见很好。在一般情况下，新闻应该尽量选用同一内容或同一地区的照片配合。我们今后当注意这个问题。同时，新闻照片也可以单独发表，不一定必须和文字报道配合发表。　　编者
