Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, January 26th: At the plenary sessions of the Second All-African People's Conference held on the morning and afternoon of January 26th, representatives from many African countries condemned the atrocities of imperialism in Africa, particularly exposing the new conspiracies they are plotting as national independence movements continue to surge. They emphasized that no imperialist conspiracy can stop the African people from achieving independence.

	Imperialism Tries to Maintain Control Over Africa; African People Must Unite to Fight
	Guinea's delegation representative, Diallo, said at the morning session that in order to achieve African independence, we must unite and fight, and strive to find all means that help us achieve this unity.

	Diallo said that neo-colonialism is a threat to Africa. Imperialists, finding themselves unable to stop the course of history and change the African people's determination for independence, are trying every means to make the African people give up the struggle. They are prepared to agree to "independence" in name, but at the same time maintain their economic control. He said that imperialists also demand to establish "communities" with Africa. They create an atmosphere of tension, suspicion, and distrust. They condemn young African countries for practicing dictatorship and interfering in their internal affairs because these countries denounce their policies of exploiting the African people. He said that all African people must fight against these dangerous practices and claims of colonialism.

	The leader of the All-African Trade Union Federation and head of the Moroccan trade union delegation, Mazouz Sidik, said on behalf of the All-African Trade Union Federation, "We African workers demand that the conference make positive decisions and put forward positive suggestions."

	Sidik pointed out that in the face of the powerful liberation movement sweeping across Africa, imperialists are trying to change their tactics, relying more on conspiracies, propaganda, and political actions of "aiding underdeveloped countries." He said, "We must find new ways to oppose new forms of exploitation." He pointed out that taking united action will enable the African people to effectively combat imperialism and neo-colonialism.

	A representative from Somaliland said that he was very happy to see that Somaliland would become independent this year, and he assured the representatives of African countries that have not yet become independent of his support for their struggle for independence.

	Niger's representative, Ousman, emphasized the importance of African unity. He condemned France's suppression in his country. He also condemned France's plan to conduct atomic bomb tests in the Sahara region.

	The Struggle of African Workers for Trade Union Rights Cannot Be Separated from the Anti-Imperialist Struggle of the African People
	The head of the delegation of the National Union of People's Forces of Morocco, Mehdi Ben Barka, in his speech, demanded that foreign troops withdraw from Morocco. He said, "Foreign occupying forces are a constant threat to the existence of young sovereign countries." Furthermore, they use the territories of these countries to support colonial wars against neighboring countries. He said that in order to build a new Africa in economic and social terms, we must pay special attention to the role of the working class and organized farmers, because they are the only guarantee for achieving this task. He also emphasized that in the struggle against imperialism, we must strive to unite the patriotic forces of all African countries.

	The representative of the General Confederation of Workers of Black Africa, Diallo Seydou, reiterated in his speech at the afternoon session the support of Black African workers for the cause of African independence. He said that the struggle for trade union rights and the political struggle are inseparable, therefore, it is necessary for the workers to unite their struggle with the comprehensive struggle of the African people against the imperialists.

	Africa is Threatened by Neo-Colonialism; The United States is the Head of Neo-Colonialism
	The President of the Cameroon People's Union, Félix Moumié, said at the plenary session of the All-African People's Conference held here today that the common enemies of the African people, the imperialists and colonialists, can no longer openly resist the universal demand for independence and unity. They are trying every means to frustrate the African people by means of reforms and even declarations of independence. Therefore, Africa is being threatened by neo-colonialism.

	He said that the American rulers should be primarily responsible for the current situation in Cameroon. Despite making some high-sounding statements, the United States is the head of neo-colonialism. The United States uses the cloak of anti-communism to cover up its economic plunder and belligerence, and it is actively supporting the French imperialists in their brutal war against the Cameroon national movement.

	The Nigerian representative emphasized that Africans must unite in the struggle for independence. He said that Africans should tell the colonialists frankly that Africa is not an extension of Europe.

	Algerian representative Boumendjel reported to the conference the news of the execution by the French authorities of four Algerian patriots imprisoned in Algeria and France, and suggested that the conference send a telegram to the French government protesting this new criminal act against the Algerian people. The representatives were very angry after hearing Boumendjel's report, and they expressed their approval of his suggestion with thunderous applause. Another representative suggested that a copy of the protest telegram be given to the Asian-African Group at the United Nations.

	All the representatives and attendees responded to the Algerian representative's suggestion and stood up to observe a minute of silence for the patriots killed by the imperialists.

	The South African representative demanded support for the South African people's struggle against racial discrimination and racial oppression.

	The representative from Northern Rhodesia said that the "Central African Federation" is just a "federation" ruled by a minority of whites over the majority of Africans. He also condemned the racial discrimination that exists in his country. He said, "We are determined to achieve independence as soon as possible. We want to tell the British that in 1960, they will see the so-called 'Central African Federation' disintegrate."

	The activities of American "observers" under various names in and out of the conference hall have attracted people's attention. This afternoon, they distributed "statements" and "memorandums" in the conference hall, slandering the conference and its leaders. It is believed that these Americans are attempting to disrupt the work of the conference and weaken its influence. It is pointed out that the representatives have become vigilant and have taken measures to prevent these "observers" from carrying out further sabotage activities.

	Colonial Forces are Adopting Deceptive Tactics; African People Do Not Want False Independence
	Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, January 27th: The Second All-African People's Conference continued to be held here on January 27th.

	Ghanaian Minister of Economic Affairs, Kozo Botsio, read out a congratulatory message from Ghanaian Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah at the meeting held this morning.

	Botsio said that imperialist and colonialist forces are now dealing with the African people in various disguises, so the African people must remain vigilant.

	He said, "If we examine the current situation carefully and more closely, we will suddenly realize that there is reason to feel alarmed and anxious, and ask this appropriate question: What kind of democracy are the imperialists and colonialists giving to newly established countries? We want independence, yes, but we must obtain true independence, not false independence."

	The representative of the Tunisian Neo Destour Party, Chak, pointed out in his speech, "The frightened Europe and distressed West are very embarrassed by the rapid evolution of the African continent, the increasing awareness of the African people, and the breaking of the shackles of colonialism." He expressed that the Tunisian people support the struggle of the Algerian people and the people of other African countries for independence.

	The representative of the Nigerian Action Group, Enahoro, emphasized African unity in his speech, and also emphasized that African countries and African people should strengthen understanding and contact.

	The Algerian National Revolution is a Symbol of the Struggle of the African People
	Guinean Minister of Public Works, Touré Ismaël, spoke at the conference on behalf of the Democratic Party of Guinea and the Guinean Trade Union, saying that the Guinean people are fighting to crush the conspiracies of the colonialists and consolidate independence.

	Touré emphasized the importance of the unity of Asian and African countries. He said, "Africa has entered a new stage of freedom and shouldering responsibility, so the people of Asian and African countries must get closer to each other." He said, "People will not forget the impact of the Bandung Conference, and the resolutions of this conference still inspire the struggle of the colonial people in Africa. Asian-African solidarity will not only help Africa finally get rid of foreign rule, but will also help restore the feeling of self-esteem of the people. The Asian-African front should be a front for fighting for peaceful coexistence, and for cooperation between the people of all countries regardless of ideology."

	When talking about the struggle of the Algerian people, Touré said, "The Algerian national revolution is a living symbol of the struggle of the people of all African countries. In front of the whole world, the Algerian resistance, which is fighting against 600,000 heavily armed troops, is thwarting French imperialism."

	Referring to the resolution on the Algerian issue passed by the previous United Nations General Assembly, Touré said that it is unimaginable to pretend to defend peace while standing idly by the Algerian tragedy. A true struggle to maintain peace cannot ignore support for the cause of the Algerian people.

	The United States Supports France in Killing the Algerian People; The Algerian People's Determination to Fight is Unshakable
	When the Algerian representative Boumendjel stepped onto the podium, all the representatives present stood up and gave him thunderous cheers. His speech was constantly interrupted by applause.

	Boumendjel thanked the representatives for giving fraternal support to the Algerian people who are fighting against the colonialists.

	Boumendjel condemned France's atrocities in Algeria and accused the United States of supporting the colonial war in Algeria. He said that the troops of the French colonialists are using American weapons to kill Algerians.

	Boumendjel exposed France's conspiracy to weaken the Algerian people's armed struggle. He said, "The Algerian people are vigilant against all these French conspiracies, and they will continue to struggle until they achieve independence." He asked the conference to provide more concrete support to the Algerian people.

	After he finished speaking, all the representatives stood up and cheered him.

	The representative of the Moroccan Independence Party conveyed his party's support for the cause of African independence at the meeting held this afternoon. He called on all Africans to give the Algerian people more material and moral support.

	Liberian representative Cassell also expressed the Liberian people's support for the African struggle for independence and the Algerian people.

	Kenyan representative Masinga demanded that Kenya immediately achieve complete and thorough independence in his speech. Referring to the negotiations between Britain and Kenya being held in London, he said that this may be another act by Britain to maintain its colonial rule over Kenya. He asked the conference to support the Kenyan people's demands: to withdraw all British military bases and military personnel from Kenya.

	The Congolese representative reported to the conference on the situation of the Congolese people's struggle against Belgian imperialism in their own country. He said that the Congolese people are determined to achieve their independence, and they have paid a huge price for this.

	Later, the chairman of the conference announced to the conference that the Belgian government had been forced to agree that the Congo would declare independence on June 30th this year. At this time, all the representatives stood up and gave long cheers.

	The head of the UAE delegation, Galal, reviewed the achievements of the African independence struggle in his speech and once again assured the UAE's support for the cause of African independence. He called on all African countries to strengthen unity to eliminate all obstacles that prevent Africa from achieving complete liberation.

	Three committees were established at the afternoon meeting to draft the resolutions and communiqués of the conference.

	Colonialism is Doomed to Collapse; The African People are Moving Towards Victory
	Algerian trade union representative Mashu spoke at the meeting held tonight, condemning France's atrocities against Algerian workers, trade unionists, and people from all walks of life in Algeria, and condemning Western countries for supporting France's war of aggression in Algeria. He said that Algerian workers and the people will continue to struggle until they achieve independence. He said: Colonialism is doomed to collapse. We are getting closer to our goal day by day.

	Ethiopian representative Maikasha called on African countries to be vigilant against various conspiracies by colonialists. He pointed out that although the number of independent African countries is increasing, the entire African continent is still under the control of colonialists. He said: We must unite and fight for independence, freedom, and justice.

	The Angolan representative accused the Portuguese colonialists of atrocities in Angola and other colonies. He asked the conference to condemn these atrocities.

    帝国主义的阴谋阻挡不了非洲的独立
    第二届全非人民大会上各国代表号召团结一致反对新殖民主义
    据新华社突尼斯26日电　在第二届全非人民大会26日上午和下午举行的全体会议上，许多非洲国家的代表在发言中谴责帝国主义在非洲的暴行，特别是揭露它们在民族独立运动不断高涨的情况下所策划的新阴谋。他们强调，帝国主义任何阴谋都不能阻挡非洲人民实现独立。
    帝国主义力图保持对非洲的控制  非洲人民必须团结起来进行斗争
    几内亚代表团代表迪亚洛在上午会议上发表讲话说，为了取得非洲的独立，我们必须团结起来进行斗争，并努力寻找有助于我们实现这种团结的一切办法。
    迪亚洛说，新殖民主义是对非洲的威胁。帝国主义者发现自己不能制止历史的进程和改变非洲人民的独立决心，因此想尽办法想使非洲人民放弃斗争。他们准备在名义上同意“独立”，但同时保持他们的经济控制。他说，帝国主义者还要求同非洲建立“共同体”。他们制造一种紧张、猜疑和不信任的气氛。他们谴责非洲的年青国家实行独裁和干涉他们的内政，因为这些国家控诉他们的剥削非洲人民的政策。他说，全体非洲人民必须同殖民主义的这种危险的做法和主张进行斗争。
    全非工会联合会领袖、摩洛哥工会代表团团长马佐·西迪克以全非工会联合会的名义说，我们非洲工人要求大会作出积极的决定、提出积极的建议。
    西迪克指出，面对着席卷全非洲的强大的解放运动，帝国主义者正在试图改变策略，更多地借助于“援助不发达国家”的阴谋、宣传和政治行动。他说，“我们必须找到新的办法来反对新的剥削形式。”他指出，采取团结一致的行动将使非洲各国人民能够有效地打击帝国主义和新殖民主义。
    索马里兰代表讲话时说，他很高兴地看到，索马里兰今年将独立，他向非洲尚未独立的国家的代表保证支持他们争取独立的斗争。
    尼日尔代表欧斯曼　强调非洲团结的重要性。他谴责法国在他的国家所进行的镇压。他还谴责法国要在撒哈拉地区进行原子弹试验。
    非洲工人争取工会权利的斗争和非洲人民反帝斗争不能分割
    摩洛哥人民力量全国联盟代表团团长迈赫迪·本·巴尔卡在讲话中要求外国军队撤出摩洛哥。他说，“外国占领军是年青的主权国家的存在的经常威胁。”此外，他们利用这些国家的领土来支持对邻国的殖民战争。他说，为了在经济和社会方面建立一个新的非洲，我们必须特别重视工人阶级和有组织的农民的作用，因为他们是实现这项任务的唯一保证。他还强调说，在反对帝国主义的斗争中，必须力求团结非洲各国的民族爱国力量。
    黑非洲工人总联合会代表迪亚洛·塞杜在下午会议上发言时，重申黑非洲工人对非洲独立事业的支持。他说，争取工会权利的斗争和政治斗争是分不开的，因此对工人们来说，把他们的斗争和非洲人民反对帝国主义者的全面斗争统一起来是必要的。
    非洲受到新殖民主义的威胁  美国就是新殖民主义的头子
    喀麦隆人民联盟主席费利克斯·穆米埃　今天在这里举行的全非人民大会全体会议上说，非洲人民的共同敌人帝国主义者和殖民主义者已经无法公然反抗争取独立和统一的普遍要求，他们正在想尽办法用改革甚至于宣布独立的办法来挫败非洲人民。因此，非洲正受到新殖民主义的威胁。
    他说，美国统治者应该对喀麦隆的现状负主要责任。美国尽管冠冕堂皇发表一些声明，但是他们是新殖民主义的头子。美国用反共的外衣掩盖它的经济掠夺和好战性，它正在积极支持法帝国主义者对喀麦隆民族运动所进行的残酷战争。
    尼日利亚代表强调说，非洲人在争取独立的斗争中必须团结起来。他说，非洲人应当正告殖民主义者，非洲不是欧洲的延长。
    阿尔及利亚代表布曼杰尔　在大会上报告了法国当局处决被监禁在阿尔及利亚和法国的四名阿尔及利亚爱国者的消息，并且建议大会致电法国政府，抗议这种对阿尔及利亚人的新的犯罪行为。代表们听了布曼杰尔的报告感到非常愤怒，他们以雷动的掌声表示赞同他的建议。另一位代表建议，把抗议电报的一份副本交给联合国亚非集团。
    全体代表和列席者响应阿尔及利亚代表的建议，起立为被帝国主义者杀害的爱国者默哀一分钟。
    南非代表　要求支持南非人民反对种族歧视和种族压迫的斗争。
    北罗得西亚代表说，“中非联邦”只是一个由少数白人统治大多数非洲人的“联邦”。他还谴责他的国家中存在的种族歧视。他说，“我们决心尽快地争取获得独立。我们要正告英国人：1960年，他们将看到所谓‘中非联邦’瓦解。”
    用各种名义的美国“观察员”在会议厅内外所进行的活动引起了人们的注意。他们今天下午在会议厅中散发了“声明”和“备忘录”，对大会和大会的领袖们进行诽谤。人们认为，这些美国人企图破坏大会的工作和削弱会议的影响。据指出，代表们已经警惕起来，并且采取了措施以阻止这些“观察员”进行进一步的破坏活动。
    殖民势力正采取欺骗手段  非洲人民不要虚假的独立
    据新华社突尼斯27日电　第二届全非人民大会27日在这里继续举行会议。
    加纳经济部长科佐·博齐约在今天上午举行的会议上，宣读了加纳总理恩克鲁玛的贺词。
    博齐约说，帝国主义和殖民主义势力现在正在以各种伪装的面貌来对付非洲人民，因此非洲人民必须保持警惕。
    他说，如果我们仔细地和更加紧密地考察当前的局势，我们就会猛然发觉有理由感到惊惶和焦虑，并提出这样一个恰当的问题：帝国主义者和殖民主义者给予新成立的国家的是什么样的民主？我们要独立，不错，但是我们必须得到真正的独立而不是虚假的独立。”
    突尼斯新宪政党的代表沙克　在发言中指出，“惊慌的欧洲和苦恼的西方对于非洲大陆的迅速演变、非洲人民觉悟的日益提高以及殖民主义枷锁的被打破，感到十分狼狈。”他表示，突尼斯人民支持阿尔及利亚人民和其他非洲各国人民争取独立的斗争。
    尼日利亚行动派代表埃纳霍罗　在发言中强调非洲国家的团结，并且强调非洲国家和非洲人民应当加强了解和接触。
    阿尔及利亚的民族革命是非洲人民斗争的象征
    几内亚公共工程部长杜尔·伊斯梅尔代表几内亚民主党和几内亚工会在大会上发言说，几内亚人民正在为粉碎殖民主义者的阴谋和巩固独立而斗争。
    杜尔着重指出亚非国家的团结的重要意义。他说，“非洲进入了自由和承担责任的新阶段，因此亚非各国人民必须互相接近。”他说，“人们不会忘记万隆会议的影响，这个会议的各项决议仍然鼓舞着非洲殖民地人民的斗争。亚非团结不仅将帮助非洲最后摆脱外国统治，并将有助于恢复人民的自尊的感觉。亚非阵线应该是为争取和平共处、为各国人民不分意识形态进行合作而斗争的阵线。”
    杜尔在谈到阿尔及利亚人民的斗争时说，“阿尔及利亚的民族革命是非洲各国人民的斗争的活生生的象征。在全世界面前，对付着六十万武装到牙齿的军队的阿尔及利亚抗战正在挫败着法国帝国主义。”
    谈到上届联合国会议就阿尔及利亚问题通过的决议时，杜尔说，伪称保卫和平而对阿尔及利亚的悲剧袖手旁观，这是令人不能想像的事。名符其实的维护和平的斗争不能忽视对阿尔及利亚人民的事业的支持。
    美国支持法国杀害阿尔及利亚人民  阿尔及利亚人民战斗决心不可动摇
    阿尔及利亚代表布曼杰尔登上讲台时，到会的代表全体起立，向他发出雷鸣般的欢呼。他的讲话不断被掌声打断。
    布曼杰尔对代表们给予正在为反抗殖民主义者而战斗的阿尔及利亚人民以兄弟般的支持表示感谢。
    布曼杰尔谴责法国在阿尔及利亚干出的暴行，指责美国支持阿尔及利亚的殖民战争。他说，法国殖民主义者的部队正在使用美国武器杀害阿尔及利亚人。
    布曼杰尔揭露法国企图削弱阿尔及利亚人民的武装斗争的阴谋。他说，“阿尔及利亚人民对所有这些法国的阴谋保持着警惕，他们将继续斗争，直到取得独立为止。”他要求大会对阿尔及利亚人民提供更多的具体的支援。
    在他发言完毕后，全体代表都站起来向他欢呼。
    摩洛哥独立党的代表在今天下午举行的会议上转达了他的党对非洲争取独立的事业的支持。他呼吁全体非洲人给予阿尔及利亚人民更多的物质和道义上的支持。
    利比里亚代表卡塞勒也表示了利比里亚人民对非洲争取独立的斗争和阿尔及利亚人民的支持。
    怯尼亚代表马辛格在发言中要求使怯尼亚立即实现完全和彻底的独立。他在谈到正在伦敦举行的英国与怯尼亚之间的谈判时说，这也许是英国想保持对怯尼亚的殖民统治的又一个行动。他要求大会支持怯尼亚人民的要求：从怯尼亚撤出英国所有军事基地和军事人员。
    刚果代表向大会报告了刚果人民在自己的国家内同比利时帝国主义进行斗争的情况。他说，刚果人民决心取得他们的独立，他们已经为此付出巨大的代价。
    后来，大会主席向大会宣布，比利时政府已经被迫同意刚果在今年6月30日宣布独立。这时，全体代表都站起来，发出长时间的欢呼。
    阿联代表团团长加拉勒　在发言中回顾了非洲独立斗争的成就，并且再次保证阿联支持非洲独立的事业。他呼吁所有的非洲国家加强团结，来排除一切妨碍非洲获得完全解放的障碍。
    下午的会议上成立了三个委员会，来起草大会的决议和公报。
    殖民主义注定要垮台  非洲人民正走向胜利
    阿尔及利亚工会的代表马舒在今天晚上举行的会议上发言，谴责法国对阿尔及利亚工人、工会人士以及阿尔及利亚其他各界人民的暴行，并谴责西方国家支持法国在阿尔及利亚进行的侵略战争。他说，阿尔及利亚工人和人民将继续斗争，直到取得独立时为止。他说：殖民主义注定要垮台。我们正在一天一天地接近我们的目标。
  埃塞俄比亚代表迈卡沙呼吁非洲国家对殖民主义者的各种阴谋保持警惕。他指出，虽然非洲的独立国家越来越多，但是整个非洲大陆还是在殖民主义者的控制之下。他说：我们必须团结起来，为争取独立、自由和正义而斗争。
    安哥拉代表指责葡萄牙殖民主义者在安哥拉和其他殖民地的暴行。他要求大会谴责这些暴行。
