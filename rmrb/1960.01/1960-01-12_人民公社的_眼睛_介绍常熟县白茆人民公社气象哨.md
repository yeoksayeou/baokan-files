The People's Commune's "Eyes"
    ——Introducing the Bai Mao People's Commune Weather Station in Changshu County
    By Our Correspondent Gao Jie
    In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, between Taihu Lake and the Yangtze River, lies a low-lying area. Before liberation, the land was barren and the people were poor, suffering from floods "nine years out of ten." The Bai Mao People's Commune in Changshu County is located in the center of this low-lying area. The famous Bai Mao Tang River flows through the commune's fields and houses into the Yangtze River, and it floods easily during rains. Local farmers had a few songs describing their lives before liberation: "Bai Mao farmers have two woes, landlord exploitation and floods, with no escape but three paths: borrowing money, hanging, and imprisonment." People called the weather there "a big rain, a big famine; a small rain, a small famine." "Rain" caused people much suffering. In the ten years since liberation, a dense network of ditches and rivers has been built here, and agricultural production has achieved successive bumper harvests. But people still felt unable to control weather changes. In September 1958, the Bai Mao People's Commune established a hydrological and meteorological station. Since then, the commune has grown "eyes," arranging farm work and directing production by observing the weather, rather than being at its mercy.
          Old Lu "Manages" the Sky
    The person in charge of this weather station is Lu Yong-sheng, a 54-year-old farmer in the commune. He has decades of farming experience and has skillfully mastered both traditional and modern weather observation skills, playing an important role in the commune's production.
    Not long after the hydrological and meteorological station was established, golden rice had just been harvested in the bountiful fields, and the commune arranged for deep plowing and sowing. According to custom, rice cut down in the fields must be brought to the threshing ground within three days, otherwise, if the weather changes and it rains, it will sprout and rot. However, the task of autumn plowing and sowing was imminent, and delaying the farming season would affect the sowing of winter wheat. Weather observer Old Lu looked at the sky, listened to the forecasts from the special district and county meteorological observatories (stations), and predicted that it would not rain in the short term. He suggested that the commune party committee temporarily pile the harvested rice in the fields and concentrate efforts on deep plowing and sowing. He was responsible for monitoring weather changes and reporting to the party committee at all times. As a result, more than 10,000 mu of japonica rice were piled in the fields for seventeen days without being damaged, and the task of deep plowing and sowing was completed as scheduled.
    In January 1959, the township launched a large-scale manure accumulation campaign. The members of the First Brigade proposed the method of "borrowing the sky to create fertilizer," without consulting the weather station. Seeing that the sky was overcast and rainy, they spread a large amount of rice straw on the muddy road, intending to have passersby trample on it, and then pile it up to ferment into grass pond mud. However, the weather did not cooperate. Just after the rice straw was laid, the rain stopped and the sky cleared. The rice straw was scattered everywhere and could no longer be collected. Old Lu was very sad when he found out, feeling that the method was good, but the weather was not controlled, and it was his dereliction of duty. From then on, he paid close attention to weather changes at all times. One day, the county meteorological station broadcast a forecast that it would rain tomorrow. In addition, in those few days, he observed that the sun was obscured by clouds around it at sunset, and he was sure that there would be continuous rain. He immediately reported to the commune party committee, and immediately organized the masses to carry out a large-scale "borrowing the sky to create fertilizer" campaign, spreading five or sixty li of grass on the muddy road. From the next day, it rained continuously for several days, and the entire commune created more than 10,000 dan of fertilizer at one time, solving the fertilizer problem for more than 500 mu of land. The members were extremely happy and praised him, saying: "Old Lu is the best, he is truly a living bodhisattva."
              Good Advisor
    The work of the Bai Mao People's Commune weather station is not simply to predict whether it will be sunny or rainy. In fact, it is also a good advisor to the commune in directing production. Old Lu is very knowledgeable about agricultural production. He is not satisfied with just looking at the sky. He often combines meteorology with agricultural experiments, studies the relationship between temperature and moisture, fertilizer, and soil on crop growth, and provides it to the commune party committee for reference.
    On February 27, 1959, the commune conducted a small "double-cropping rice sowing experiment" in Fengchanwei in order to sum up experience, but did not consider meteorological issues. Based on his past farming experience, Old Lu knew that the emergence of seedlings after sowing was closely related to ground temperature. What ground temperature is most suitable for emergence? In the past, he heard the township agricultural technology extension station say that it should be above ten degrees. Taking this opportunity, he moved the ground temperature experiment that he routinely performed every day to the experimental field, and observed and recorded the temperature and crop growth every day. After eighteen days, he discovered the problem: "The seedlings have emerged very little eighteen days after sowing, and the average ground temperature is only eight degrees, which is too low and not suitable for sowing." At the same time, the commune party committee saw that the farming season had arrived and was afraid of delaying the sowing period. It was just about to deploy the entire commune to carry out large-scale seed soaking and seed dropping for double-cropping rice. He thought that the experiment field had already proved that sowing at low temperatures was not conducive to emergence. It doesn't matter if the seedlings don't emerge in the small experimental field, but if the seedlings don't emerge well after large-scale seed dropping, that is a big problem. Therefore, he reported his experiment and the opinions of the agricultural technology extension station to the commune party committee, and the commune delayed the seed soaking period. In order not to delay the farming season, he continued to go to the field every day to measure the ground temperature. Three or four days later, he found that when the ground temperature rose above ten degrees, he notified the commune to immediately carry out comprehensive seed soaking and seed dropping. Subsequent inspections proved that the emergence rate of seed dropping on February 27 when the ground temperature was eight degrees was only 30%, and the emergence rate of sowing later when the ground temperature was above ten degrees reached more than 70%. The commune party secretary praised him and said: "Old Lu's meteorological work is very clever. It can be said to be an arm of the commune in directing production."
            Scientific
    Speaking of people's communes running meteorological stations, relying on old farmers to look at the sky based on experience, study agricultural proverbs, and use animals such as chickens, ducks, and leeches as native instruments to infer the weather, some people may think it is unscientific. In fact, it is not so. Farmers have accumulated a lot of rich weather knowledge in thousands of years of fighting against nature. Now, with the leadership of the party, on the basis of the large-scale weather forecasts of the national, provincial, special district, and county meteorological observatories (stations), scientifically applying the old experiences of local farmers to carry out supplementary weather forecasts for small-scale areas is a forecasting method that is scientific and realistic. This method has shown great effect in guiding agricultural production.
    The Bai Mao People's Commune weather station once had such an example. On June 8th last year, the wheat was ripe, and the entire commune was harvesting wheat and threshing it. The threshing grounds were full of golden wheat being dried. That day, the county meteorological station forecast that there would be no rain. Old Lu was not so sure. As usual, the first thing he did when he got up in the morning was to go out and look at the sky. He saw that the fields were shrouded in white mist. "There is fog in the yellow plum season, the rain is on the way," it seemed that the weather was not reliable. Although the sun was shining brightly that day, he never relaxed his monitoring of the sky. At 1:30 in the afternoon, he found a cloud in the northwest corner of the sky moving from west to east. In addition, the ground was unbearably hot, and the night before, he saw that the bluestone in the room was still damp, the pickled vegetable urn was bubbling, the chicks were flying onto the hens, and other phenomena, so he judged that there would be a heavy rain soon. He immediately found the commune party secretary to report this matter. The commune immediately held a telephone conference to arrange for the rush harvest of the threshing ground. At just after two o'clock, there was indeed a thunderstorm, and the wheat was not damaged at all. After a while, the rain stopped and the sky cleared, and the happy sound of the threshing machine and the songs of the people working resounded again on the threshing ground.
    Of course, Old Lu did not realize the importance of the work of the weather station from the beginning. In the early days of its establishment, he spent all day measuring water levels, observing celestial phenomena, and filling out weather reports, and he didn't know what these things were for. In addition, sometimes he predicted that there would be typhoons and rainstorms, and some members simply replied to him: "We'll see when it comes, no one can guess the sky." He was so angry that he asked the commune to let him go back to carry a hoe. Later, the facts educated him and everyone else. In particular, thanks to his timely reporting of the rising water level of the Bai Mao Tang to the commune on September 10th, which mobilized five or six thousand people overnight to rush to repair more than 170 dikes and dams, more than 20,000 mu of crops were protected from waterlogging. Since then, his enthusiasm and confidence in doing meteorological work have grown even greater.
    The commune party secretary told him: The county meteorological station reports the weather for a day or half a day, and we should pay attention to the weather in a small area and grasp the changes in two or three hours. He felt a great responsibility and often used his brain to study how to combine traditional and modern methods of observing meteorology. In addition to purchasing or making more than a dozen meteorological instruments himself at the beginning, he successively collected native instruments such as leeches, chickens, pickled vegetable urns, cotton balls, and weather-predicting flowers, carefully observed the changes of these things, and recorded them every time, finding out the law of their change or unchanging. Therefore, he often listened to the weather forecast of the county meteorological station, and then comprehensively analyzed the changes of several animals and verified agricultural proverbs to judge the weather. He collected more than 200 agricultural proverbs, but he did not believe every one of them, but verified them one by one, and only used those that conformed to the local reality. He also invited three other old farmers in the commune to be his advisors. When he encountered difficult weather that he could not judge, the four of them would hold a meeting to study it together.
    Now, this small commune weather station, in addition to Lu Yong-sheng, also has a young farmer. He is Lu Yong-sheng's assistant. They regularly observe 22 items every day, including air temperature, ground temperature, wind, sunshine, clouds, rainfall, evaporation, as well as water level, groundwater level, and soil moisture content. The accuracy rate of weather forecasts reaches more than 97%, becoming an indispensable part of the commune's production and members' lives. (Attached pictures)

    人民公社的“眼睛”
    ——介绍常熟县白茆人民公社气象哨
    本报记者  高洁
    在长江下游，太湖、长江之间，有一片低洼地带，解放前地瘠民贫，是个“十年九涝”的苦地方。常熟县白茆人民公社就在这片洼地的中心，著名的白茆塘河水穿过公社的田野、房舍，奔入长江，一遇天雨就要泛滥成灾。当地农民有几句歌谣形容解放前的生活：“白茆农民有两害，地主剥削和水灾，无法迫走三条道，借债、上吊、坐牢监。”人们称那里的天气是“大雨大荒年，小雨小荒年。”“雨”把人们害苦了。解放后十年来，这里修建了密如蛛网的水沟河道，农业生产获得连年丰收。可人们对天气变化，还是感到无法掌握。1958年9月，白茆人民公社成立了水文气象哨。从此，公社像长了“眼睛”，安排农活，指挥生产，处处看天行事，而不是听天摆布了。
          老陆“管”天
    主持这个气象哨的是公社里一位五十四岁的老农陆永生。他有几十年种地经验，又巧妙地掌握了土的和洋的看天本领，在公社生产中起了重要作用。
    水文气象哨成立不久，丰收的田野里，黄澄澄的稻子刚刚割倒，公社又安排了深翻、播种的任务。按习惯，稻子割倒在地里，最多三天就要收上场，否则变天下雨，就会发芽霉烂，可秋耕秋种的任务又迫在眉睫，误了农时，将影响冬小麦的播种。气象观测员老陆看看天，听了专区和县气象台（站）的预报，推断短期内不会下雨，就建议公社党委把已经割下来的稻子暂时堆在田里，集中力量深翻、播种。他负责监视天气变化，时刻向党委汇报，结果使一万多亩粳稻堆在田里十七天，没有受到损失，深翻、播种的任务也如期完成。
    1959年1月，乡里大搞积肥运动。第一大队社员提出“借天造肥”的办法，没有和气象哨联系，看看天有阴雨，就把大批稻草铺在泥路上，打算让过路行人踩踏，然后堆在一处发酵制成草塘泥。可是天公不作美，偏偏稻草铺好后雨过天晴，稻草随处散失，再也收集不起来。老陆知道了，心里很难过，觉得办法很好，就是没有掌握天气，这是自己失职。从此他时刻注意天气变化。一天，县气象站广播预报明天有雨，加上那几天他观察到日落时太阳周围被云层遮没的情况，肯定要下连绵雨。他就立刻汇报公社党委，马上组织群众进行大规模借天造肥，泥路上铺下五、六十里长的草。第二天起果然连下了几天阴雨，全公社一次造了一万多担肥，解决了五百多亩田的肥料。社员个个高兴得了不得，称赞说：“老陆顶呱呱，真是活菩萨。”
              好参谋
    白茆人民公社气象哨的工作，完全不是单纯地预报天晴下雨，实际它还是公社指挥生产的好参谋。老陆对农业生产很在行，他不满足于光是看看天，经常结合气象，做一些农事试验，研究气温与水分、肥料、土壤对作物生长的关系，提供公社党委参考。
    1959年2月27日，公社在丰产圩搞了一小块“双季稻的播种试验”，以便总结经验，可并没有考虑到气象上的问题。老陆凭过去种田经验，知道播种以后出苗和地面温度有密切关系。究竟怎样的地温最适宜出苗呢？过去他听乡里农业技术推广站说过要十度以上，趁此，他就把每天照例进行的地温试验移到试验田里，每天观测记录温度和作物的生长情况。经过十八天后，给他发现了问题：“播种十八天，苗还出的很少，地温平均只有八度，太低了，不宜播种”。在此同时，公社党委看到农时已到，怕耽误了播种期，正好要布置全公社进行双季稻的大面积浸种落谷。他一想，试验田里已经证明低温时播种，对出苗不利。小块试验田不出苗不要紧，大面积播种落谷，出苗不好，那就是一个大局面问题了。于是，他把自己的试验和农业技术推广站的意见向公社党委作了汇报，公社延迟了浸种期。为了不误农时，他继续每天每刻到田里去测定地温，三、四天后，他发现地温上升到十度以上时，通知公社立即全面浸种落谷。事后检查证明，在2月27日地温八度时落谷的出苗率仅30％，后来在地温十度以上时播种的出苗率达到70％以上。公社党委书记赞扬他说：“老陆的气象工作很灵巧，可以说是公社指挥生产的一只臂膀了。”
            合乎科学
    提起人民公社办气象哨，靠老农凭经验看天，研究农谚，用鸡、鸭、蚂蝗等动物作土仪器，以此来推断天气，有人或者以为不科学。实际并不如此。农民在成千年与大自然作斗争中，积累了很多丰富的天气知识，现在有了党的领导，在全国、省、专区和县气象台（站）大范围天气预报的基础上，把当地农民的老经验科学地运用起来，进行小范围地区的补充天气预报，正是合乎科学、切合实际的预报方法。这种方法在指导农业生产中显示了很大的作用。
    白茆人民公社气象哨就曾有过这样一件事例。去年6月8日，麦子黄熟了，全公社都在千军万马收割麦子和脱粒，打麦场上到处晒着金黄的麦子。那一天，县气象站预报没有雨。老陆可不怎么放心。他早上起身照例第一桩事就是出门看天。但见田野里白雾茫茫。“黄梅里有迷雾，雨在半路”，看来天气有些靠不住。这天，虽然烈日当头，可他一刻也没有放松监视天空。下午一时半，他发现西北角天上有一团云由西向东移，加上地面闷热不堪，头天夜里又看到室里青石还潮、咸菜瓮里翻泡泡、小鸡飞到母鸡身上等等现象，判断马上要来阵大雨。他立刻找到公社党委书记汇报这事。公社立即开了电话会议，布置抢收麦场。两点多钟，果然来了一场雷暴雨，麦子丝毫没有受到损失。不一阵，雨过天晴，麦场上又响起了脱粒机欢快的声音和人们劳动的歌声。
    当然，老陆也不是一开始就意识到气象哨工作的重要性。成立初期，他成天量水位、观天象、填气象报告表，不知道这些东西有啥用。加上有时他预报说要有台风、暴雨，有的社员就干脆回答他：“来了再看，天不给人猜的。”他气的要求公社还是让他回去扛锄头。后来，事实教育了他，也教育了大家。特别是9月10日一场狂风暴雨，幸亏他及早把白茆塘水位上涨的情况报告了公社，连夜动员五、六千人抢修了一百七十多条堰坝，保护了二万多亩庄稼免受水涝。从此，他搞气象的劲头和信心更大了。
    公社党委书记告诉他：县气象站报一天、半天的天气，我们要注意小范围天气，掌握二、三小时的变化。他感到责任重大，经常开动脑筋，研究将土的和洋的观测气象方法结合起来。他除了在开始时由公社陆续购买或自造了十多种气象仪器外，先后收集了蚂蝗、鸡、咸菜瓮、棉花球、晴雨花等土仪器，细心地观察这些东西的变化，每次都记录下来，找出他们变与不变的规律。因此，他常是一面收听县气象站的天气预报后，再综合分析几种动物的变化和验证农谚来判断天气。他收集了二百多条农谚，但并不条条都信，而是一条条地加以验证，合乎当地实况的才用。他还邀请公社里另外三位老农作他的参谋，遇有疑难天气判断不了时，他们就四个人一起开会研究。
    现在，这个小小的公社气象哨，除了陆永生外，还有一位青年农民。他是陆永生的助手。他们每天定时观测的项目有气温、地温、风、日照、云、雨量、蒸发，以及水位、地下水位、土壤含水率等共二十二个项目，预报天气的准确率达到97％以上，成为公社生产和社员生活中一个不可少的组成部分。（附图片）
