Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, December 31st: On New Year's Eve, the final assembly line of the Luoyang First Tractor Manufacturing Plant shone with dazzling red light. Tractors wearing bright red coats moved forward along the assembly line, one after another. They roared like spring thunder on the test field, showing off their power like spring oxen leaving the pen.

This is the last batch of "Dongfanghong" tractors assembled in 1959. Although the factory's employees had already completed the year's state plan ahead of schedule and overproduced more than 250 tractors, they tried every means to increase production in order to contribute more to agricultural production in 1960.

In recent days, a wave of technical innovation has swept through the entire factory. Many workshops have suggestions from everyone and innovations for every machine. The workers of the tractor assembly department put forward more than 300 rationalization proposals. After assembly worker Sang Shouqing created the automatic return of the electric hoist, all ten electric hoists and one crane in the entire department achieved automatic return overnight. Veteran worker Ling Bingzhang also created an automatic drilling machine. These creations have greatly improved assembly efficiency.

    1959年最后一批“铁牛”出栏
    据新华社洛阳31日电　新年前夕，洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂的总装配线上，闪耀着鲜艳夺目的红光。披着红色外衣的拖拉机，随着装配带的向前移动，一台接着一台地开了出来。它们在试验场上发出春雷般的隆隆声响，像春牛出栏一样，抖擞着威风。
    这是1959年最后装配的一批“东方红”拖拉机。这个工厂的职工虽然早已提前完成了全年国家计划，超额生产了二百五十多台拖拉机，但是，为了给1960年的农业生产多贡献一分力量，他们想尽一切办法，增产再增产。
    这些天来，全厂技术革新蔚然成风。许多车间人人有建议，台台有革新。拖拉机装配工部的职工提出三百多条合理化建议。装配工桑守庆创造了电胡芦回程自动化以后，全工部十个电胡芦和一台天车，一夜之间就全部实现回程自动化。老工人凌丙章还创造了自动钻眼机。这些创造使装配效率大大提高了。
