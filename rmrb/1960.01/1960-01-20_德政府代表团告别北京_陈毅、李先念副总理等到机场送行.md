Xinhua News Agency, January 19th. The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, led by Deputy Prime Minister Heinrich Rau, concluded its visit to China and left Beijing by special plane at 10:00 this morning for Pyongyang, to visit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    Heavy snow was falling in the sky over the airport today, and the weather was cold, but the friendship between the Chinese and German people made people feel especially warm. When the German guests, together with Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairmen Guo Moruo and Huang Yanpei, and others, stepped into the airport on the white snow, the band played the national anthems of Germany and China. Deputy Prime Minister Heinrich Rau, accompanied by Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian, reviewed the guard of honor. Then, he shook hands and said goodbye to the heads of various departments of our national organs, people from all walks of life in China, and diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials of various countries stationed in China who came to see him off.

    Vice Premier Li Xiannian delivered a speech to bid farewell to the guests. He said: Respected Comrade Deputy Prime Minister Rau, respected comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, comrades and friends:

    The friendly visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Deputy Prime Minister Heinrich Rau to our country has come to an end, and you are about to leave our country. As we bid farewell to our respected guests, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Deputy Prime Minister Rau and all the comrades of the delegation once again on behalf of the Chinese government and people.

    The Chinese people and the people of the German Democratic Republic are like-minded brothers. The thought of Marxism-Leninism and the ideal of striving for lasting peace and realizing communism closely link us together. We are very pleased to see that the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries are strengthening day by day. This visit to our country by Deputy Prime Minister Rau at the head of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic has made an important contribution to further strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Germany. There is no doubt that the continuous strengthening of the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries will promote the continuous growth of the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and will be conducive to the development of peace and human progress.

    Respected guests, your visit has brought the profound friendship of the people of the German Democratic Republic to our people, greatly encouraged our people's revolutionary enthusiasm for defending world peace and building socialism, and left a deep and unforgettable impression on our people. The friendship between the Chinese and German people has been established in the long-term common struggle. The Chinese people have always cherished this friendship very much and will continue to work hard to consolidate and develop this friendship.

    The people of the German Democratic Republic will always have the firm support of all the Chinese people in their struggle for the reunification of their country and the defense of European security and world peace. I would like to take this opportunity to ask our respected guests to bring the sincere friendship and cordial greetings of the Chinese people to the fraternal people of the German Democratic Republic.

    I wish all the comrades of the delegation good health and a pleasant journey!

    Deputy Prime Minister Heinrich Rau delivered a farewell speech. He said:

    Respected Comrade Li Xiannian, Comrade Chen Yi,

    Dear comrades and friends:

    On behalf of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic and in my own name, I express my sincere and heartfelt thanks to you and all the Chinese comrades and friends for the unparalleled hospitality we received everywhere during our visit.

    During our visit to your great and beautiful country, we had the opportunity to visit modern factories, people's communes, and cultural and welfare facilities, and to learn about the great achievements of the "Great Leap Forward." The great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction have left a deep impression on us. The diligence, creativity and drive of the Chinese working people are an encouragement to our German Democratic Republic in its struggle to complete the great tasks of socialist construction in the next few years.

    The visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of China has once again demonstrated, and further strengthened and deepened, the close and unbreakable friendship between our two countries and our two peoples.

    The numerous talks we had with the representatives of the People's Republic of China in a warm and frank atmosphere all showed that we had reached complete agreement on all the issues discussed.

    The long-term trade agreement and the treaty of commerce and navigation signed during our visit are a clear expression of the results of this visit. These two treaties and agreements will greatly promote cooperation between our two countries. In the future, the two countries will continue to provide each other with full support in socialist construction in the spirit of proletarian internationalism.

    The solid foundation for all this is the ideological unity of the socialist camp and the joint effort to maintain world peace.

    Long live the powerful and invincible socialist and peace camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic!

    Long live the great and prosperous People's Republic of China and the glorious Chinese Communist Party, and may they prosper and grow stronger!

    Long live world peace and understanding between all peoples!

    Dear Chinese friends and comrades, goodbye!

    Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairmen Guo Moruo and Huang Yanpei, and others, accompanied the guests to the plane. Here, the guests and hosts once again shook hands warmly to say goodbye, and young women from the capital presented flowers to the guests.

    Also present at the airport today to see off the delegation were Wu Xiuquan, Zeng Yongquan, Lei Renmin, Lin Haiyun, Liu Mingfu, Wu Heng and others.

    The Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, Wang Daier, and embassy officials, as well as German experts who are helping our country in its construction, and the Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, Li Yonghao, also went to the airport to see them off.
