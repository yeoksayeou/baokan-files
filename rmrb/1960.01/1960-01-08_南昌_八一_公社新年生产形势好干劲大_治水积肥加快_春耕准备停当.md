Nanchang, January 7th (report from this newspaper) The "August 1st" People's Commune in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, achieved a major all-round success in agricultural production in 1959. At the beginning of the new year, taking advantage of the excellent situation in the countryside, it vigorously grasped winter production and spring ploughing preparations centered on water and fertilizer, creating a good start for continued leaps forward in agricultural production in 1960.

With the arrival of the new year, the commune's winter production and preparation activities became increasingly enthusiastic. In order to achieve water conservancy this spring, the labor force invested in water conservancy construction increased from 500 last winter to 1,000. High work efficiency movements were universally carried out at various construction sites, and construction efficiency rose sharply. More than 180 members of the Liantang Brigade, which was building the Liantang drainage channel, launched a shock campaign at the beginning of the new year. The members worked underwater for several days and nights in a row, completing the task half a month ahead of schedule. So far, 80% of the commune's entire water conservancy task has been completed. The new year's fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing movement is even more vigorous, with the daily progress greatly accelerated. The entire commune accumulates and manufactures nearly 300,000 dan of fertilizer on average every day, four times faster than before the new year. The Jiangnan Brigade has always had little fertilizer and low grain yields. This year, the entire team launched a fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing "good start" shock campaign. More than 200 male and female members turned out together and accumulated more than 60,000 dan of fertilizer on New Year's Day alone. In the rapeseed and green manure fields, members went out in teams, actively preventing frost and freezing and applying topdressing. In the first few days of the year, all 4,000 mu of winter crops in the commune were topdressed once, and the seedlings in every field reached the first-class standard. The professional teams, composed of 59 cadres and 754 members, responsible for transforming barren fields, have gone deep into remote areas, setting up camps next to the barren fields, accumulating and manufacturing large quantities of fertilizer, and striving to transform more than 6,000 mu of low-yielding fields in the commune to unleash greater production potential. Wu Rongtang, the captain of the "August 1st" Brigade, led more than 90 members to build sheds next to the barren fields, accumulating fertilizer during the day and manufacturing fertilizer at night. After half a month of hard work, the team's more than 800 mu of barren fields had two fertilizer cellars built in each field, with more than 500 dan of fertilizer accumulated per mu, ten times more than in previous years.

Grasping early, grasping meticulously, and grasping well were important successful experiences of the "August 1st" Commune in preparing for farming last year. This year, immediately after New Year's Day, the commune's Party committee organized a major inspection of farming preparations, checking the preparation of farm tools, cattle, seeds, and seedling fields. Through inspection, the 200 plows and harrows that needed repair in the commune were promptly organized for iron and wood workers to repair. Cattle were also subjected to a surplus and deficit adjustment. After inspection, all 1,800 mu of seedling fields in the commune were plowed again, and 10 dan of human manure and urine were applied per mu. The entire farming preparation work was more than a month earlier than in previous years and was basically ready.

At the beginning of the new year, the "August 1st" Commune Party Committee continued to promote the work method of cadres dividing up fields and contracting for production, going deep into production to lead production, and strengthening the leadership of production teams. The entire commune was divided into three zones, each with a fixed secretary in charge. Party committee members contracted for brigades, and brigade cadres contracted for teams, establishing a responsibility system of "contracting for one year and handing over accounts at the end of the year." Dai Xianggen, deputy secretary of the commune's Party committee, was assigned to be responsible for the three poor teams of Qianxi, Nandeng, and Nanjiang this year. As soon as he arrived in the team, he ate, lived, and labored with the members, personally leading the members to vigorously accumulate and manufacture fertilizer. Within three days, these three teams accumulated more than 710,000 dan of pond mud and turf, equivalent to half of the fertilizer accumulated by the three teams last winter.

In 1959, the "August 1st" People's Commune achieved great growth in both agricultural and sideline production and commune-run industries compared to 1958. The total output value of agricultural and sideline production and commune-run industries in 1959 increased by 1.5 times compared to 1958; among them, the total grain output increased by 24.5%, the total oil crop output increased by 50%, and the number of pigs, poultry, and aquatic products increased by more than two times; the output value of commune-run industries also increased by 58.9% compared to 1958. As a result of the year-end distribution last year, the average net income per person in the commune reached 79 yuan, an increase of one time compared to 1958. On this basis, the commune recently formulated a plan for continued leaps forward in 1960. This year, the total grain output will increase by 1.1 times compared to 1959, oil crops will increase by six times compared to 1959, and pig production will achieve one pig per mu of land. Other industries such as forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and commune-run industries will all increase by more than one time compared to 1959.

In order to better mobilize the members to strive to complete this new leap forward plan, the "August 1st" Commune organized cadres and members to hold discussions on how to complete this plan during the New Year's Day period. Cadres and members believed with full confidence that there are many favorable conditions at present, the situation is very good, and as long as we continue to exert our energy, it is entirely possible to comprehensively achieve the commune's leap forward plan this year.

    南昌“八一”公社新年生产形势好干劲大
    治水积肥加快　春耕准备停当
    本报南昌7日电　江西南昌县“八一”人民公社1959年取得了农业生产满堂红的重大成就，新年开始，又乘农村的大好形势，狠抓以水肥为中心的冬季生产和春耕准备工作，创造了1960年农业生产继续跃进开门红的局面。
    新年来临，“八一”公社冬季大生产和备耕活动，日益热烈。为争取今春实现水利化，全社投入兴修水利的劳动力由去冬的五百人增加到一千人，各工地普遍开展了高工效运动，施工工效直线上升。修建莲塘排渍道的莲塘大队一百八十多名社员，新年开始就开展突击运动，社员们在水下作业，连战几天几晚，提前半个月完成了任务。到现在为止，全社整个水利任务已完成80％。新年的积肥造肥运动更是轰轰烈烈，日进度大大加快。全社每天平均积肥造肥近三十万担，比年前的速度加快四倍。江南大队历来肥少，粮食产量不高，今年全队开展了积肥造肥“开门红”的突击运动，二百多名男女社员一齐出动，元旦一天就积了肥料六万多担。在油菜田和绿肥地里，社员们结队出动，积极防霜防冻和施追肥。开年的几天中，全社四千亩冬季作物，全部追了一次肥，丘丘禾苗达到了一类的标准。由五十九名干部和七百五十四名社员组成的改造瘦田的专业队，已经分头深入边远地区，在瘦田旁安营扎寨，大积大造肥料，争取把全社六千多亩低产田改造过来，发挥更大的增产潜力。“八一”大队队长吴荣堂带领九十多个社员，在瘦田旁搭起草棚，白天积肥，晚上造肥，经过半个月的奋战，全队八百多亩瘦田丘丘作起了两个肥窖，每亩田积肥达五百多担，比往年增加十倍。
    抓早、抓细、抓好，这是“八一”公社去年备耕工作的一项重要的成功经验。今年元旦一过，公社党委就组织一次备耕工作大检查，检查了农具、耕牛、种子和秧田的准备情况。通过检查，全社需要修补的二百件犁耙，及时组织了铁木工进行修补。耕牛也进行了一次余缺调剂。全社一千八百亩秧田，检查后又普遍耕了一次，每亩田增施了十担人粪尿。整个备耕工作比往年提早了一个多月，基本上准备就绪。
    “八一”公社党委在新的一年开始，继续推行干部划田包干，深入生产领导生产，加强对生产队组的领导的工作方法。全社划成三个片，每个片固定了一名书记负责，党委委员包大队，大队干部包小队，建立了“包干一年，年终交账”的责任制。公社党委副书记戴祥根，今年分工负责钱溪、南邓、南江三个穷队。他一到队，就与社员同吃、同住、同劳动，亲自带领社员大搞积肥造肥。三天内这三个队就积了塘泥、草皮七十一万多担，相当于三个队去冬积肥的一半。
    “八一”人民公社1959年农副业和社办工业都比1958年获得了很大的增长。1959年农副业和社办工业的总产值比1958年增长一点五倍；其中粮食总产量增长24．5％，油料总产量增长50％，毛猪、家禽和水产增长二倍以上；社办工业产值也比1958年增长58．9％。去年年终分配的结果，全社每人平均的纯收入达七十九元，比1958年增加一倍。在此基础上，这个公社最近制定了1960年继续跃进的计划。今年粮食总产量将比1959年增长一点一倍，油料作物将比1959年增长六倍，毛猪生产要实现亩田一头猪，其他如林业、畜牧业、渔业和社办工业等都将比1959年增长一倍以上。
    为了更好地动员社员为完成这一新的跃进计划而奋斗，“八一”公社元旦期间组织了干部和社员对如何完成这一计划进行了座谈。干部和社员满怀信心地认为，当前的有利条件很多，形势很好，只要继续鼓足干劲，完全有可能全面实现今年全社的跃进计划。
