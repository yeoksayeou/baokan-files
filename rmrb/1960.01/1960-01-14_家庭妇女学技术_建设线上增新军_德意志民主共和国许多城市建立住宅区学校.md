    Housewives Learn Technology to Build a New Force Online
    Many Cities in the German Democratic Republic Establish Residential Area Schools
    In a residential area school in Frankfurt, German Democratic Republic, a lecture is being held, and people are attentively listening and taking notes. The topic of the lecture is: What are semiconductors?
    At a table sit two women, one of whom is named Helga Schulz, twenty-eight years old. This evening, her husband is taking care of the children so she can come out and listen to the lecture.
    We asked this young woman why she came to listen to such a specialized lecture. She replied, "To prepare. I want to start working again, to work in a semiconductor factory."
    "Why do you want to work again?"
    "Because housework doesn't satisfy me."
    This has become a customary answer today.
    For housewives to come out to study and participate in work is a requirement of socialist construction. This is a requirement of Frankfurt's rapid industrial development after healing the wounds of war.
    In May 1945, 70% of Frankfurt's buildings were burned to rubble and ashes by the fascist bandits. To restore it to its original appearance, the people of Frankfurt have done a lot of work. According to the German Democratic Republic's seven-year plan for developing the national economy, by 1965, Frankfurt's industrial production will increase by 575% compared to 1958. The Republic's first large-scale semiconductor factory will be built in Frankfurt, and this new factory alone will need four thousand workers. Frankfurt is also building the first cotton textile factory, which also needs six thousand workers. However, Frankfurt only has 56,000 residents, and workers only account for 16.1% of the population. Of course, there are no unemployed people.
    In order to accelerate socialist construction, mobilizing housewives to enter new factories has become an important task.
    One evening in the spring of 1959, the residents of Frankfurt's 19th residential area received encouraging good news from the grassroots party organization of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany: a school would be established in the residential area. Subsequently, the 19th Residential Area Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany made a decision in the draft seven-year plan: to provide all residents of all residential areas with the possibility of further improving themselves, a residential area college will be established on July 1, 1959.
    Thus, Frankfurt established the first residential area college. As soon as it was established, sixty residents signed up to participate. They paid tuition, received course attendance permits, and began attending classes at times convenient for everyone. The content of the lectures includes general reports, such as: "Why is the German Democratic Republic a legitimate German state?" There are also various specialized reports; this depends on what kind of workers the factory is preparing to absorb, such as questions about the work of the cotton textile factory, from "How is cotton grown" to "What did you see on a visit to a cotton mill," etc., so that listeners can initially familiarize themselves with the work of the factory they will be joining. "What are semiconductors?" is one of the specialized reports given by the semiconductor factory at the residential area college.
    This residential area college made a good start. Subsequently, the second and third residential area colleges successively opened classes, and more and more residents participated.
    Each college has a committee responsible for college affairs. This committee, together with the Association for the Popularization of Scientific Knowledge, jointly formulates topics and lectures. The members of the college committee include intellectuals, workers, staff, and housewives.
    The chairman of the 23rd Residential Area Committee, Peter Klein, recently proposed that a nursery that can accommodate sixty children be built for the semiconductor factory within the scope of the 1960 national construction project, so as to relieve women of their burdens and allow them to enter the factory to work.
    Frankfurt has also set an example for other cities. Strausberg, Bad Freienwalde, and other cities have established residential area colleges and included them in the network of rural and factory colleges, which has opened up a new area of work for the National Front of Democratic Germany—the leader of the colleges, adding new strength to the labor army of socialist construction in the German Democratic Republic.

    德意志民主共和国许多城市建立住宅区学校
    在德意志民主共和国法兰克福的一个住宅区学校里，正在举行报告会，人们正在注意地听讲并记笔记。报告的题目是：什么是半导体？
    在一张桌子旁坐着两个妇女，其中一个名叫赫尔加·舒茨，二十八岁，这一天晚上，由她的丈夫带孩子睡觉，让她出来听报告。
    我们问起这个年青的妇女，为什么来听这样比较专门的报告呢？她回答说：“作准备工作，我想重新开始工作，到半导体厂工作。”
    “为什么你要重新工作呢？”
    “因为家务劳动不能满足我。”
    这在今天已成为习惯性的回答了。
    家庭妇女出来学习并参加工作，这是社会主义建设的要求。这是法兰克福在医治好战争创伤以后走上快速发展工业的道路的要求。
    1945年5月，法兰克福的建筑有70％被法西斯分子用大火烧成瓦砾和灰烬。为了恢复它本来的面貌，法兰克福的人们进行不少工作。根据德意志民主共和国发展国民经济的七年计划，到1965年，法兰克福的工业生产与1958年的生产相比，将要提高575％。共和国的第一个大型半导体工厂将在法兰克福建造，单单这个新厂需要四千个劳动力。法兰克福还正在建立第一个棉织厂，它也需要六千个劳动力，而法兰克福只有五万六千居民，工人只占人口的16．1％，当然没有失业者。
    为了加速社会主义建设，动员家庭妇女走进新的工厂，就成为重要课题了。
    1959年春天的一个晚上，法兰克福的第十九住宅区的居民们，从德国统一社会党的基层党组织那里得到了一个鼓舞人心的好消息：住宅区里要建立一所学校。接着，民主德国全国阵线第十九住宅区委员会在七年计划草案中作出了决定：为给所有住宅区的全体居民提供进一步提高自己的可能，将于1959年7月1日建立住宅区学院。
    这样，法兰克福兴办了第一所住宅区学院。刚一成立时就有六十个居民报名参加。他们缴了学费，领了听课证，利用大家都方便的时间开始了听课。教授内容有一般性的报告，如：“为什么德意志民主共和国是合法的德意志国家？”也有各种专门性的报告；这要看什么工厂准备吸收什么样的工人而定，例如关于棉织厂的工作问题，就有“棉花是怎样生长的”，直到“在一座棉纺厂参观了些什么”等等，使听讲的人能够初步熟悉将要参加的工厂的工作情况。“什么是半导体？”就是半导体工厂在住宅区学院作的专业性报告之一。
    这个住宅区学院作了个良好的开端。接着，第二个、第三个住宅区学院相继开课了，参加的居民越来越多。
    每一所学院都有一个负责院务的委员会。这个委员会和科学知识普及协会一起共同制定题目和讲授内容。学院委员会的委员中有知识分子、工人、职员和家庭妇女。
    第二十三住宅区委员会的主席彼德·克雷恩不久前曾提出，要在1960年国家建设事业的范围内给半导体工厂建造一个可容纳六十个儿童的托儿所，以便使妇女们解除负担，进厂工作。
    法兰克福也为其他城市树立了榜样。斯特劳斯堡、巴德·弗莱恩瓦尔德和其他一些城市都建立了住宅区学院，并且列入了乡村和工厂学院网之内，这就给民主德国全国阵线——学院的领导者开辟了一个新的工作范围，为德意志民主共和国社会主义建设的劳动大军中增添了新生力量。
