Anshan Iron and Steel Athletes Hold Technical Review
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 31st: Anshan Iron and Steel, on the eve of the New Year, is immersed in a joyous atmosphere. While tens of thousands of iron and steel workers are celebrating the great victory of production in 1959 amidst the sound of gongs and drums, they are also welcoming an even greater victory in 1960.
    Stepping into the workshop of the famous No. 3 Steelmaking Plant, what unfolds before one's eyes is a scene of bustling production. Workers wearing heat-resistant suits run back and forth between the instrument room and the front of the furnace, adjusting the gas one moment and operating in front of the furnace amidst the high temperature of the flames the next. The workers of the entire plant are conducting a technical review through technical performance competitions. Liu Guohua, the secretary of the plant's Party committee, is also working alongside the workers, engaging in the intense work of repairing the furnace in front of the open hearth furnace. Not long ago, Liu Guohua helped the workers establish various professional technical research groups, and to date, more than 500 sets of advanced experience have been summarized and formulated.
    At this time, the large open hearth furnace next to it began to tap steel again. The molten steel illuminated the factory, reflecting the workers' victorious smiles. The splashing sparks of steel are seeing off 1959, and the workers, who are welcoming an even greater victory in 1960, have already stood on a new starting line.

    英雄立大志　定叫新年胜旧年
    钢铁、煤炭、机械、石油、纺织、基建、交通职工越战越强
    鞍钢健儿举行技术大检阅
    据新华社鞍山31日电　新年前夕的鞍钢，沉浸在一片欢腾的气氛里。十几万钢铁大军在锣鼓声中庆祝1959年生产巨大胜利的同时，正在迎接1960年更大的胜利。
    踏进著名的第三炼钢厂的厂房，展现在面前的是一幅热气腾腾的生产景象。穿着防热服的工人们，在仪表室和炉前之间来往奔跑，一会儿调整煤气，一会儿冒着火焰高温在炉前操作。全厂工人们正在通过技术表演赛，开展一场技术大检阅。厂党委书记刘国华也同工人一道在平炉前展开了紧张的补炉工作。不久前，刘国华帮助工人成立了各种专业技术研究小组，到目前止已总结和配出五百多套先进经验。
    这时，旁边的大平炉又开始出钢了。钢水映红了厂房，映出了工人们胜利的笑容。飞溅的钢花正在送走1959年，迎接1960年更大胜利的工人们，已经站到新的起跑线上。
