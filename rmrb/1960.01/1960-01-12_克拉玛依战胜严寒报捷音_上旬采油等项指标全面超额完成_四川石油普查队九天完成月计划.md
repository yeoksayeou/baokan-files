Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 11th -- The tens of thousands of workers in the Karamay oil region have overcome unusually severe snowstorms and cold weather, exceeding all production targets for the first ten days of this year. By the 10th, oil extraction had reached 101% of the ten-day plan, oil transmission reached 102.6% of the ten-day plan, drilling reached 140.9% of the ten-day plan, oil testing reached 121.9% of the ten-day plan, and refining reached 111.6% of the ten-day plan. Compared with the daily production level in December last year, oil extraction increased by 5.1%, oil transmission increased by 22.7%, drilling footage increased by more than threefold, refining increased by 22.6%, and light oil recovery rate increased by 3.6%.

Since the end of last year, the Karamay oil region has experienced several heavy snowfalls, and the temperature has plummeted to between minus twenty-five and thirty-five degrees Celsius. The severe cold threatened the 50,000-meter-long underground oil pipeline network in the oil region. Therefore, frost prevention and insulation became the most prominent problems at the time. On New Year's Eve last year, the leading cadres of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration and the Karamay Mining Area personally led more than 1,000 people to the field, adopting measures such as burying oil pipes deeply and using hundreds of indigenous insulation stoves to increase the temperature of the oil pipes. They fought hard for ten days to keep the large and small oil pipelines in the entire mining area, as dense as a spider web, unblocked.

Currently, Karamay is still in the coldest season of the year, and the severe cold is pressing. However, the tens of thousands of workers who have already achieved a comprehensive victory in production in the first ten days are seizing the time to work in all aspects and vigorously carrying out technical innovations, striving to comprehensively exceed the January production plan and lay a good foundation for a red start every month throughout the year.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 11th -- The Sichuan Petroleum Survey Team completed its January production plan comprehensively and ahead of schedule in nine days. Among them, mechanical core drilling completed 103.8% of the monthly plan twenty-two days ahead of schedule, an increase of 127.6% compared with December last year; the monthly efficiency of drilling rigs increased by 145% compared with the plan, and the cost was reduced by 70.8% compared with the plan. There were no major personal or equipment accidents, and the quality of drilling met the design requirements. At the beginning of this year, all the team's employees encountered production difficulties such as many hard rock layers, many broken strata, and the tendency for drilling pipes to get stuck easily. In order to ensure a good start, the employees launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "breaking through the barriers of hard rock layers, complex strata, and deep-well accidents." The entire team put forward 315 innovation proposals from the 1st to the 9th, implemented 95 of them, and broke through many key production points.

    克拉玛依战胜严寒报捷音
    上旬采油等项指标全面超额完成
    四川石油普查队九天完成月计划
    新华社克拉玛依11日电　克拉玛依油区数万职工战胜了历年来少有的风雪严寒，超额完成了今年头十天的各项生产指标。到10日止，采油完成旬计划101％，输油完成旬计划102．6％，钻井完成旬计划140．9％，试油完成旬计划121．9％，炼油完成旬计划111．6％。同去年12月份日产水平比较，采油增长5．1％，输油增长22．7％，钻井进尺增加三倍多，炼油增长22．6％，轻质油回收率提高3．6％。
    克拉玛依油区从去年年底以来连续落了几场大雪，气温急剧下降到零下二十五度至三十五度。严寒威胁着油区长达五万米的地下输油管线网。因此，防冻保温成了当时最突出的问题。在去年除夕晚上，新疆石油管理局和克拉玛依矿区党政领导干部，就亲自率领矿局一千多人分赴野外，采取深埋油管和用几百个土法保温炉加高油管温度的办法，奋战了十天使全矿区密如蛛网的大小输油管线始终畅通。
    目前，克拉玛依还处在一年当中最冷的季节里，严寒逼人。但是，已经在头十天生产上取得全面胜利的数万职工，正在各个环节上抓紧工作，大搞技术革新，力争全面超额完成1月份生产计划，为全年月月红打下良好基础。
    据新华社重庆11日电　四川石油普查大队用九天时间全面超额完成了1月份的生产计划。其中机械岩心钻探提前二十二天完成月计划的103．8％，比去年12月份增长了127．6％；钻机的台月效率，比计划提高145％，成本比计划降低70．8％。没有发生重大的人身设备事故，钻探的质量合乎设计要求。全队职工在今年一开始，就遇到硬岩层多、破碎地层多和井内容易发生卡钻事故的生产上的困难。职工们为了保证开门红，开展了以“攻破硬岩层、复杂地层、深井事故关”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。全队在1日到9日共提出革新建议三百一十五条，实现九十五条，突破了很多生产关键。
