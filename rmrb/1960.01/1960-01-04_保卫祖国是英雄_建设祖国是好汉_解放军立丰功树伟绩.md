Defending the Motherland are Heroes, Building the Motherland are Good Men
The People's Liberation Army Establishes Great Merits and Sets a Brilliant Example

	Over the past year, they heroically defended the southeast coast of the motherland; swiftly quelled the rebellion in Tibet; achieved a large-scale bumper harvest in military training; vigorously developed cultural and educational programs; contributed more than 40 million workdays to participate in national construction; and the Railway Corps completed the engineering construction plan on twenty-five railway lines twenty-five days ahead of schedule.

	(Reported by this newspaper) Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line and marching towards the goal of modernization and revolutionization, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has, in the past year, successfully completed the glorious tasks of defending and building the motherland, and achieved even greater successes in military, political, and cultural studies, and other endeavors than in previous years.

	Over the past year, the troops on the Fujian front have heroically defended the southeast coast of the motherland, severely打击(dǎ jī = struck) the harassing and destructive activities of the Chiang Kai-shek troops. In dozens of artillery battles, the frontline artillery effectively defended the production and construction of the coastal people, and the air force units protected the safety of merchant ships and fishermen in many air battles. Pingtan Island, close to the islands of Kinmen and Matsu occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, completed the annual fishing plan 36 days ahead of schedule under the protection of the People's Navy, and the fishing volume of Beishuang, Fuyu and other islands increased by one-third compared with the previous year due to the protection of our naval vessels. At the same time, the frontline navy also protected more than 13,000 merchant ships to safely pass through the waterways along the Fujian coast.

	In March last year, the reactionary upper-class group in Tibet launched an armed rebellion. The troops of the Tibet Military Region fought heroically and quickly quelled the rebellion, allowing the Tibetan people to gain a new life.

	While defending the motherland, various troops have persistently carried out socialist and communist education over the past year, and the level of awareness of officers and soldiers has been continuously improved. Under the ideological guidance of advancing towards the goal of revolutionization, the whole army has launched a wave of studying Chairman Mao's military works in order to climb the peak of military science. 80% of the cadres at or above the battalion level in the Nanjing area troops have participated in training teams, systematically studying Chairman Mao's works; thousands of platoon and company-level cadres have improved their military thinking and political level through self-study.

	Because Chairman Mao's military thought has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, although the training of various troops is more demanding and the subjects are more complex than in previous years, the number of units with large-scale bumper harvests is more than in previous years. "Excellent" individual items of entire divisions and regiments continue to appear, and the number of "all-red" battalions and companies has also doubled. On the basis of comprehensive harvest, there are more and more officers and soldiers with "one specialty and multiple skills." The activities of mutual agency of duties by various personnel carried out by a certain artillery unit enabled political work cadres to command operations, and many artillerymen were able to conduct observation, communication, and driving vehicles. Armored soldiers with "multiple skills" can not only drive tanks and operate artillery, but also perform simple repairs. The "multi-skilled" sailors on naval vessels are not only proficient in their duties, but also can steer and navigate, measure wind direction and water depth, identify directions, and some can also troubleshoot mechanical failures and make minor repairs to ships.

	In cultural studies, in accordance with the instructions of the General Political Department to "basically popularize secondary and higher education among cadres within ten years," various troops have launched a wave of cultural studies, established a large number of cultural spare-time schools and various forms of self-study organizations, and established a team of full-time and part-time teachers. According to incomplete statistics, more than 84% of the cadres participated in the study, most of whom are studying secondary school courses, and some have begun to study university courses. The vigorous development of cultural education has had a practical effect on various tasks of the troops. After studying mathematics and physics courses, many cadres have promoted the improvement of military technology, and after studying Chinese courses, their reading and writing abilities have also been improved.

	Over the past year, various troops have also achieved brilliant achievements in participating in national socialist construction. According to preliminary statistics, the whole army contributed a total of more than 40 million workdays, 36% more than the original target. Among them, more than 5,600 water conservancy projects, including the Miyun Reservoir and the Dongping Lake Reservoir, were participated in, and more than 70 expansion and new construction projects of industrial and mining enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, Kunming Iron and Steel Plant, and Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant, and 393 urban construction projects such as the Great Hall of the People in the capital. In addition to the Railway Corps, 415 kilometers of railway subgrade and more than 11,600 kilometers of highways were built. Various special forces troops have also invested a large amount of modern equipment and technical forces into industrial and agricultural production and construction. In addition to dispatching aircraft and ships to rescue flood victims, the Air Force dispatched 579 sorties of aircraft in the fight against drought and locusts to carry out artificial rainfall for nine provinces including Hubei, Henan, and Inner Mongolia, benefiting an area of more than 43.6 million square kilometers; sprayed insecticide on more than 120,000 mu of land in Shaanxi and other provinces, so that they were spared from insect pests. Armored forces, engineering forces, and logistics departments, etc., in order to support agricultural mechanization, used various methods to help people's communes train tens of thousands of tractor drivers, car drivers, engineering technicians, and electricians, welders, and other technical workers. Factories and repair shops stationed in Nanjing, Wuhan and other places also used their spare time to process and manufacture agricultural machinery and power equipment for people's communes. The "universal" tractor put into production by a certain naval factory is dexterous and sturdy, and has a wide range of uses, and is very popular among the masses.

	Last year, the Railway Corps completed the national railway engineering construction plan on twenty-five railway main lines and branch lines in the north and south of the motherland twenty-five days ahead of schedule. The Kunming-Yipinglang Railway, the Xiangtan-Loudi section of the Xiangqian Railway and three main and branch lines and five special lines have been handed over to the state and industrial and mining enterprises for operation.

	Now various troops are summarizing experience, celebrating the harvest, and striving for continued leap forward this year, and unremittingly struggling to defend the motherland and defend peace. (Attached picture)

    保卫祖国是英雄　建设祖国是好汉
    解放军立丰功树伟绩
    一年来，英勇保卫了祖国东南沿海；迅速平息了西藏叛乱；军事训练大面积丰收；文化教育蓬勃发展；献出四千多万个劳动日参加国家建设；铁道兵在二十五条铁路线上提前二十五天完成工程建设计划
    本报讯　高举毛主席军事思想红旗，向现代化革命化目标迈进的中国人民解放军，过去的一年中，在总路线光辉照耀下，圆满地完成了保卫祖国、建设祖国的光荣任务，并在军事、政治、文化学习等各项工作中取得了比往年更大的成绩。
    一年来，福建前线部队英勇保卫了祖国的东南沿海，沉重打击了蒋军的骚扰破坏活动。前线炮兵在数十次炮战中，有力地保卫了沿海人民的生产建设，空军部队在多次空战中，保卫了海上商船、渔民的安全。临近蒋军盘踞的金门、马祖等岛屿的平潭岛，一年来在人民海军的保护下提前三十六天完成了全年的捕鱼计划，北霜、浮?等岛也由于我军舰艇的保护，捕鱼量比前一年增加了三分之一。同时，前线海军还保护了一万三千多艘商船安全通过福建沿海的航道。
    去年3月，西藏上层反动集团发动了武装叛乱，西藏军区部队英勇奋战，迅速平息了叛乱，使西藏人民获得了新生。
    在保卫祖国的同时，一年来各部队坚持不懈地进行了社会主义、共产主义教育，官兵们觉悟水平不断提高。在向革命化目标前进的思想指导下，全军上下为攀登军事科学高峰，掀起了学习毛主席军事著作的热潮。南京地区部队现有的80％的营级以上的干部参加了集训队，较系统地攻读了毛主席的著作；数以千计的排、连级干部，通过自学提高了军事思想和政治水平。
    由于毛主席军事思想深入人心，各部队的训练虽然比往年要求高，课目复杂，但是大面积丰收的单位却比往年多，整师、整团的单项“优秀”不断出现，“满堂红”的营、连也在成倍增加。在全面丰收的基础上，“一专多能”的官兵越来越多了。炮兵某部开展的各类人员互相代理职务的活动，使政治工作干部都能指挥作战，许多炮手能够进行观测、通信、驾驶车辆。装甲兵的“多能手”既能开坦克、操炮，又会简单的修理。海军舰艇上的“多能”水兵，不仅精通本职业务，还能掌舵导航，测量风向水深，辨别方位，有的还会排除机械故障，小修船只。
    在文化学习中，各部队根据总政治部“十年内在干部中基本上普及中、高等教育”的指示，掀起了文化学习热潮，办起了大批文化业余学校和各种形式自学组织，建立起一支专职和兼职的教员队伍。据不完全统计，84％以上的干部参加学习，其中大部分在学习中学课程，一部分开始攻读大学课程。文化教育的蓬勃发展，对部队各项工作发生了实际作用。许多干部学习了数、理课程以后，促进了军事技术水平的提高，学习了语文课程以后，阅读能力和写作能力也有所提高。
    一年来，各部队在参加国家社会主义建设中也取得了辉煌成就。据初步统计，全军共献出劳动日四千多万个，比原订指标多36％。其中参加密云水库、东平湖水库等水利工程共有五千六百多项，参加鞍钢、包钢，昆明钢铁厂、重庆钢铁厂等工矿企业的扩建、新建工程七十多项，参加首都人民大会堂等城市建设三百九十三项。除铁道兵以外，修建的铁路路基四百一十五公里，修筑公路一万一千六百多公里。各特种兵部队还以大量的现代化装备和技术力量投入了工农业生产建设。他们除了派出飞机、舰艇抢救受水害的灾民等以外，在抗旱、灭蝗斗争中，空军出动五百七十九架次飞机，为湖北、河南、内蒙古等九个省施行人工降雨，受益面积达四千三百六十多万平方公里；为陕西等省的十二万多亩土地喷洒灭虫药剂，使其免遭虫害。装甲兵、工程兵和后勤部门等为了支援农业机械化，用各种方法帮助人民公社训练了数万名拖拉机手、汽车驾驶员、工程技术员和电工、焊工等技术工人。驻南京、武汉等地的工厂和修理所，还利用业余时间为人民公社加工制造农业机械和动力设备。海军某工厂投入生产的“万能”拖拉机，灵巧坚固，用途广，很受群众欢迎。
    铁道兵部队去年在祖国南北各地二十五条铁路干线和支线上，提前二十五天完成了国家铁道工程建设计划。昆（明）一（平浪）铁路，湘黔铁路湘（潭）娄（底）段等三条干支线和五条专用线已交付国家和工矿企业运营。
    现在各部队正在总结经验，欢庆丰收，为争取今年继续跃进，为保卫祖国、捍卫和平不懈地奋斗。（附图片）
