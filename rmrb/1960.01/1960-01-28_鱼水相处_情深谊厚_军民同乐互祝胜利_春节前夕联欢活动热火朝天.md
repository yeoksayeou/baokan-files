Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: On the eve of the Spring Festival, the People's Liberation Army stationed throughout the country and the local people enthusiastically celebrated together, and everywhere was filled with the deep friendship between the army and the people like fish and water.

At the grand army-civilian celebration held in Shanghai on the 26th, Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor, extended cordial greetings to the army, navy, and air forces stationed in Shanghai on behalf of the people of the city, and highly praised the PLA's significant contributions in defending the motherland and participating in socialist construction. Major General Qin Hualong, Deputy Political Commissar of the Shanghai Garrison, expressed heartfelt gratitude on behalf of all commanders and fighters to the people of Shanghai for their warm support and care for the troops. The Shenyang Municipal Ten-Thousand People Army-Civilian Celebration was held simultaneously in eleven theaters last night. Huang Oudong, Second Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of the Province, Lieutenant General Du Ping, head of the Shenyang area troops, and other leaders, along with the participating soldiers and civilians, wished each other victory and celebrated the New Year together. At the army-civilian celebration jointly held by Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City, Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Huo Shilian, Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Governor, Lieutenant General Lin Weixian, Commander of the Zhejiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, and other party, government, and military leaders, greeted and wished well over six thousand officers and soldiers, workers, farmers, disabled soldiers, etc., and watched literary and artistic performances together. The naval forces stationed in Guangdong, etc., also held a grand celebration with local residents on the 26th.

In the past few days, the army and people on the Fujian front have been enthusiastically celebrating together. In Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou and other cities, thousands of soldiers and civilians are holding get-togethers and friendship evenings together every day. Fishermen from Pingtan Island, Dongshan Island, and Huangqi Peninsula also carried freshly caught fish to the troop garrisons to celebrate with sailors, artillerymen, and coastal defense soldiers. During the joint celebrations on islands such as Dadeng and Wuyu, amateur performance teams jointly organized by soldiers and militiamen performed literary and artistic programs reflecting victories in the struggle against the enemy, such as "The Song of Sentry Duty" and "Eight Sisters." At the celebration held by soldiers and laborers of a certain unit working on a sea dyke project in Xiamen-Jimei, they exchanged pennants and gifts to jointly celebrate the victory of the early completion of the sea dyke project. When the Young Pioneers of a certain island on the front line celebrated with the soldiers, they presented the island's defense troops with a sea defense sentry statue made of shells, and attached a letter saying: "Red scarves are especially happy during the festival, and our happiness all depends on the PLA uncles." Many people's communes at the forefront, while celebrating with the frontline soldiers, also drank "victory wine" and ate "bumper harvest meals" together.

The army-civilian celebration in Nanjing this year is more lively than in previous years. Starting from the 25th, various forms of friendship activities have been held in various districts. At a celebration held by the army and naval forces stationed in the Lushun-Dalian area, workers, sailors, and fishermen at the servicemen's club, they reveled from evening until dawn. When the troops on Dongtou Island in Zhejiang celebrated with residents of the outer islands, they warmly used pork, cabbage, and other products they produced to entertain guests.
