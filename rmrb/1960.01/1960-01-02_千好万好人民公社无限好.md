    People's Commune is Infinitely Good
    Huang Haicheng, National Labor Model, Deputy Director of Lianhua Commune, Haicheng County, Fujian Province
    Under the correct leadership of the Party, our Lianhua Commune resolutely implemented the general line of socialist construction in 1959. Relying on the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune and giving full play to the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, we overcame the devastating super typhoon disaster and achieved a bumper harvest of late rice. The total output reached more than 67,490,000 catties, an increase of 68% compared with the late rice in 1958, and the average yield per mu reached 1,136 catties, winning the glorious title of a thousand-catty late rice commune. Due to the bumper harvest of autumn grain, 98% of the commune members increased their income, and public accumulation also increased greatly. The whole commune sold more than 30 million catties of surplus grain to the state.
    The reason why we were able to achieve such great results in 1959 should be attributed to the leadership of the Party and the superiority of the people's commune. From midnight on August 22 to the early morning of August 23, 1959, a super typhoon of magnitude 12 or above, accompanied by heavy rain, came very fiercely. The tide generally crossed the dikes, and 185 breaches were washed out in the commune's dikes. More than 54,000 mu of late rice fields were flooded, including more than 16,400 mu seriously affected by alkali, and more than 3,600 mu of seedlings were buried by sand and soil, destroying more than 1,000 mu. In the face of this severe and devastating disaster, thanks to the strong leadership of the Party and the superiority of the commune, workers, peasants, merchants, students and soldiers united as one, went all out to fight against natural disasters, and finally quickly repaired all the breaches in the seawall, drained the accumulated water, and promptly washed and top-dressed the seedlings, so that most of the affected seedlings quickly recovered their vitality, and a bumper harvest of late rice was seized in the year of great disaster. This fact has made us more deeply aware of the truth that "of all the lines, the Party's leadership is the first; of all the goodness, the people's commune is infinitely good."
    The Great Leap Forward in 1959 inspired us with greater enthusiasm, and we are determined to seize a greater harvest in 1960. At present, a high tide of pig raising and fertilizer accumulation has been set off, requiring 10,000 dan of refined fertilizer and 1,000 dan of native fertilizer per mu of early rice. The commune is vigorously engaged in water conservancy construction. In addition to building a reservoir, it will also build ten small reservoirs, five dams, and build 44 pumping stations, vigorously improve the soil, and level 30,000 mu of land, gradually realizing garden-style farming and self-flowing irrigation. The commune members of our commune are full of confidence and are determined to continue the Great Leap Forward in 1960.

    千好万好人民公社无限好
    全国劳动模范福建省海澄县莲花公社副社长  黄海澄
    我们莲花公社1959年在党的正确领导下，坚决贯彻社会主义建设总路线，依靠人民公社的无比优越性，充分发挥广大社员的冲天干劲，战胜了摧毁性的特大台风灾害，获得了晚稻特大丰收，总产量达到六千七百四十九万多斤，比1958年的晚稻增产68％，平均亩产达到一千一百三十六斤，获得了晚稻千斤社的光荣称号。由于秋季粮食特大丰收，使98％的社员都增加了收入，公共积累也大大增加。全社出售给国家的余粮达三千多万斤。
    1959年我们所以能取得这么大的成绩，应归功于党的领导，归功于人民公社的优越性。1959年8月22日午夜到23日清晨，十二级以上的特大强台风夹着暴雨，来势非常凶猛，海潮普遍越过堤岸，全社堤岸被冲破缺口一百八十五处，晚稻田受淹达五万四千多亩，其中严重受碱的一万六千四百多亩，禾苗被沙土埋没的三千六百多亩，摧毁一千多亩。在这严重的毁灭性的灾害面前，由于党的坚强领导，公社的优越性的发挥，工农商学兵拧成一股绳，全力以赴和自然灾害斗争，终于迅速修好了所有海堤决口，排除了积水，及时洗苗、追肥，使受灾的秧苗大都迅速恢复了生机，在大灾年中夺取了晚稻特大丰收。这个事实，使我们更深刻地认识到“千条万条，党的领导第一条；千好万好，人民公社无限好”的真理。
    1959年的大跃进鼓起了我们更大的干劲，决心在1960年夺取更大的丰收。目前，一个养猪积肥的高潮已经掀起，要早稻亩施精肥一万担，土肥一千担，公社已在大力兴修水利，除修建一个水库外，还要修建十个小型水库，五个水坝，建筑抽水机站四十四个，大搞改良土壤，平整土地三万亩，逐步实现园田化和灌溉自流化。我们公社社员都满怀信心，定要在1960年继续大跃进。
