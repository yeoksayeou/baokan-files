Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: In 1959, China basically achieved the use of improved varieties for its major crops. The area under improved varieties reached over 1.8 billion mu, accounting for more than 80% of the country's total sown area. In nine provinces and regions, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Hubei, Guangdong, and Guangxi, the area under improved varieties reached over 90%. Among crops, cotton had the highest area under improved varieties, accounting for 97%; followed by wheat at 92%; rice at 90%; corn at 85%; potatoes at 85%; and soybeans at 83%.

Most of the improved varieties currently promoted are selected, bred, and promoted by the masses from China's original improved varieties. Some are new varieties cultivated by the masses and scientific institutions, such as the Bima No. 4 wheat variety. Some were introduced from countries like the Soviet Union in recent years, such as the Soviet Vogi No. 1 cotton variety. In 1949, the crops planted by farmers across the country were all local ordinary varieties, with improved varieties only accounting for about 10 million mu. The area under improved varieties in 1959 increased more than 170 times compared to 1949.

In the year after communization, the work of breeding and promoting improved varieties developed even more rapidly. In Guangdong Province, more than 153,000 cadres and masses from the People's Communes participated in seed selection and breeding. They established "three fields"—improved seed breeding fields, variety testing fields, and new variety selection fields—as the center for breeding improved varieties, and carried out activities such as new variety selection, seed comparison tests, and seed inspection and storage. In order to select high-yield varieties, People's Communes in Shanxi and Jiangsu provinces selected more than 610,000 wheat single plants with eighty to one hundred grains or more. In the Ningbo area of Zhejiang, People's Communes selected 1.5 million rice single panicles with more than 300 grains. Last year, a large number of advanced individuals in selecting and breeding improved varieties emerged in various regions. For example, Yang Minghan and Zhou Hanhua, young farmers from Guangdong Province, and Lian Shouwen, a farmer from Guangxi, bred the "Thousand-Grain Rice" variety; Yang Kuangbao, a farmer from Zhejiang, bred the "Ten-Thousand-Grain-per-Jin" rice variety; and Zhang Sizhou, a farmer from Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, bred the twelve-petal large cotton boll. The emergence of "Thousand-Grain Rice" and "Ten-Thousand-Grain-per-Jin" rice has created conditions for China to breed new varieties with "large panicles, many grains, and heavy grains," further increasing the yield per unit area of crops.

In order to continuously increase the yield per unit area, China will systematically select and replace better and higher-yielding improved varieties. Shandong, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces and regions are all training seed cadres, and training work in Hebei, Gansu, Zhejiang, and other provinces will also begin. The vast majority of People's Communes and production teams across the country have established improved seed breeding farms, small farms, experimental breeding farms, and specialized seed teams.

Currently, relevant departments in various regions are leading People's Communes to inspect the quantity, quality, and storage of crop seeds prepared for this year's spring and summer planting. Many People's Communes are also mobilizing the masses to exchange improved varieties and select seeds. (Attached picture)

### 各地人民公社抓紧检查种子数量质量和保管情况  为春播备足良种  全国主要农作物在一九五九年已基本实现了良种化

    各地人民公社抓紧检查种子数量质量和保管情况
    为春播备足良种
    全国主要农作物在一九五九年已基本实现了良种化
    据新华社13日讯　1959年，全国主要农作物已基本实现了良种化。良种推广面积已达十八亿多亩，占全国播种面积80％以上。江苏、浙江、黑龙江、辽宁、河北、山西、湖北、广东、广西等九个省区良种面积达到90％以上。从农作物看，棉花良种面积最高，占97％；其次为小麦，占92％；水稻占90％；玉米占85％，薯类占85％，大豆占83％。
    现在推广的良种，大部分是就我国原有良种，发动群众选育、繁殖推广的，一部分是群众和科学机关培育的新种，如碧蚂四号小麦良种等，也有近年从苏联等国家引进的，如涡及一号棉花良种等。在1949年，全国农民所种的农作物，都是当地的普通品种，良种面积仅有一千万亩左右。1959年的良种种植面积，比1949年增加一百七十多倍。
    公社化以后的一年间，良种的培育、推广工作更加迅速地发展起来。广东省人民公社参加选种、育种工作的干部和群众已有十五万三千多人，他们以建立良种繁殖田、品种试验田、新品种选育田等“三田”，作为繁育良种的中心，展开了新品种选育、种子对比试验、种子检查和保管等活动。山西和江苏等省的人民公社为了选育高产品种，选出的八十粒到一百粒以上的小麦单株有六十一万多个，浙江宁波专区各人民公社选出的三百粒以上的水稻单穗有一百五十万穗。去年，各地还涌现了大批选育良种的先进人物。如育成水稻“千粒穗”的广东省青年农民杨明汉、周汉华和广西农民廉受文，育成“万粒斤”的水稻品种的浙江农民杨匡保，育成十二瓣大棉桃的四川省简阳县农民张泗洲等。水稻“千粒穗”、“万粒斤”的出现，为我国育成“穗大、粒多、粒重”的新品种，进一步提高农作物单位面积产量创造了条件。
    为了不断提高单位面积产量，我国将有计划地逐步选育和更换更好的更高产的良种。山东、山西、内蒙古、四川、广东、广西等省区，都在训练种子干部，河北、甘肃、浙江等省的训练工作也将开始。全国绝大部分人民公社和生产队都建立了良种繁殖场、小农场、试验繁殖场以及种子专业队。
    现在，各地有关部门正领导人民公社检查今年准备春播和夏播作物种子的数量、质量和保管情况。许多人民公社也在发动群众调换良种和选种。（附图片）
