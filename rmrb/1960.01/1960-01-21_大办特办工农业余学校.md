    Vigorously Run and Greatly Develop Workers' and Peasants' Spare-Time Schools
    The rapid development of China's economic construction urgently requires technicians and engineers for both new and old factories and mines. In order to meet agricultural modernization, people's communes urgently need various levels of technical talents and experts. In recent years, advanced workers and peasants have persisted in studying, and tens of thousands of workers and peasants have emerged from illiteracy. Some have completed primary and secondary school courses. With the development of the situation, they are urgently demanding advanced studies. As one of the main forces of the cultural revolution, how should institutions of higher learning respond to this new situation?
    Universities and colleges must do everything possible to run schools for workers and peasants. If they can run full-time schools, they should run full-time schools; if they can run spare-time schools, they should run spare-time schools; if they can run one school, they should run one school; if they can run ten schools, they should run ten schools; if they cannot run long-term programs, they should run short-term training classes. In short, they must tap all potential, vigorously run and greatly develop, and run as many as possible and as well as possible. Shandong Institute of Technology, Dalian Institute of Technology, Hubei University, and Shandong University have already achieved results. The leaping-forward situation is pressing, and the country's construction requires several times or dozens of times the increase in technical strength. Many more workers' and peasants' spare-time schools should be established quickly. It is very good and worthy of learning for all universities and colleges to set up eight full-time and part-time higher vocational schools successively since last year, like Dalian Institute of Technology.

    大办特办工农业余学校
    我国经济建设事业的飞速发展，新旧厂矿企业都迫切地需要技术人员、工程师，人民公社为了迎接农业现代化，更迫切地需要各种、各级技术人材和专家。先进的工人、农民，近几年来，坚持了学习，成千成万的工农群众脱离了文盲状态，有的读完了小学、中学的课程。随着形势的发展，他们迫切地要求深造。作为文化革命主力军之一的高等院校，面临这一新形势，应当怎样作呢？
    高等学校要千方百计地为工人、农民办学校。能办全日制的办全日制；能办业余学校的办业余学校；能办一所的办一所，能办十所的办十所，不能办长期的就办短期训练班。总之，要挖尽一切潜力，大办特办，尽量办得多办得好。山东工学院、大连工学院、湖北大学、山东大学等院校已做出了成绩。跃进的形势逼人，祖国的建设事业要求几倍几十倍地增长技术力量，应当迅速地多办许多工农业余学校。像大连工学院那样，从去年以来，先后办起八所全日制和业余的高等专科学校，是很好的，很值得各高等学校学习。
