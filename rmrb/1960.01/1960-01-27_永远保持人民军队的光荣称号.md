　　Forever Maintain the Glorious Title of the People's Army
　　Zhang Zhongyi, Instructor of the "Xuchang Company" of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Ten years ago, when we first set foot on the island, the scene was one of utter devastation. Houses were burned down, fishing boats were robbed, docks were destroyed... At that time, we swore an oath: to defend the motherland's coastal defense together with the island people, and to rebuild our homes for the island people! In the ten years since entering the island, we have lived up to the expectations of the Party and the people and maintained the honor of the "Xuchang Company." In 1958 and 1959, our company achieved "Excellent" results in military training. We also did everything possible to participate in and support the socialist construction of the island people, and we have forged a close friendship with them. In the past two years alone, our company has contributed more than 3,100 labor days to support local construction.
　　Our company's soldiers feel the greatest joy in doing everything for the island people. The island's transportation is inconvenient, which brings many difficulties to the fishermen. Heavy fishing gear must be carried on shoulders, and nothing can be transported in wind and rain. Together with fraternal companies, we built a five-kilometer-long road for the local people. The masses were overjoyed and called this road "Liberation Army Road." There is a seawall on the island that is more than ten miles long. If a gap is carelessly breached by a large storm, thousands of acres of farmland and two or three villages within the dike will be flooded by seawater. Therefore, whenever a typhoon warning is issued, we join with the local people to form a storm rescue team and guard the seawall day and night. Last August, before the arrival of a Force 12 typhoon, we worked with the masses to harvest all the early rice and transport large quantities of materials to safe areas, so that the people's property was not damaged. In the severe drought of July the year before last, the fishermen were all out at sea, and the farm work at home depended entirely on the women. We actively supported the drought resistance efforts. The women carried water to the foot of the mountain, and the soldiers took over and carried it to the top of the mountain. Many soldiers' shoulders were swollen and some were broken, but no one complained. In order to solve the difficulty of water shortage due to drought, the local commune party committee decided to build a large reservoir. Our company squeezed out time to come from more than ten miles away and joined the construction of the reservoir. The summer before last, the fishing season was approaching, and the local fishing team had prepared all the work, but they lacked fresh mao bamboo for making anchor ropes. When we learned of this, we asked our superiors for instructions and gave our own fresh mao bamboo to the fishing team. The fishermen overfulfilled their fishing plan and sent a big red letter of congratulations, which read: "With fresh mao bamboo, we can engage in production; a timely rain after a long drought, giving charcoal in the snow!" We and the masses are like one family. Our barracks sometimes become temporary warehouses for the masses, and the ball field becomes a drying ground for fish. Pushing boats, drying nets, and transporting fishing gear, wherever people are needed, our soldiers are there.
　　Some of the soldiers in our company are called "living Luo Shengjiao" by the masses. They often risk their lives to rescue people in distress. On August 19, 1958, Xu Axiu, a student from the local elementary school, went to a small island in the sea to cut firewood after the tide receded. When she returned home, the tide had risen and she was accidentally knocked down by the waves and swept away. Fu Huasheng, the cook squad leader of our company, rushed over after hearing the news. Regardless of the strong wind and waves, and regardless of the chaotic reefs at the bottom of the sea, he jumped into the sea. When he swam to Xu Axiu's side, he was already exhausted. He told the child to hold on to his waist and struggled desperately in the water. At this critical moment, soldier Fan Shunbao, who was recuperating from illness, also rushed over. He jumped into the sea and swam to the shore with Fu Huasheng each holding one of Axiu's arms. The child was saved, but Fu Huasheng and Fan Shunbao fainted, leaving fourteen wounds on their bodies from being hit by hidden reefs. In the past two years, the soldiers of our company have saved the lives of eight people one after another.
　　For ten years, our relationship with the island people has been as close as fish and water. Whenever fishermen go out to sea to fish, we beat gongs and drums to see them off. When the fishermen return with a good harvest, the soldiers and civilians hold a get-together to celebrate the harvest together. When the masses rush to plant razor clams, we stop our drills to help with the rush. When the troops are working, the local men, women, and children all go to the mountains to support them. We love the island, we love the island people, and we want to unite closely with the island people to jointly build the motherland's seaside paradise.

    永远保持人民军队的光荣称号
    中国人民解放军“许昌连”指导员　张忠义 十年前，当我们刚刚踏上海岛的时候，到处是一片凄惨景象。房屋被烧毁了，渔船被抢走了，码头被破坏了……。当时，我们就宣誓：和海岛人民一起，保卫祖国海防，为海岛人民重建家园！进岛十年来，我们没辜负党和人民的希望，保持了“许昌连”的荣誉。在1958年和1959年，我们连的军事训练都取得了“优秀”的成绩，我们还尽一切力量参加和支援了海岛人民的社会主义建设，和海岛人民结成了亲密友谊。仅是最近两年，我们连支援当地建设就有三千一百多个劳动日。
    我们连的战士，为海岛人民每做一件事，都感到是最大的愉快。海岛交通不方便，给渔民带来不少困难。沉重的渔具要用肩挑，遇到刮风下雨，什么东西也不能运送。我们和兄弟连队一起，为当地群众修了一条五公里长的公路。群众欢欣鼓舞，把这条公路叫做“解放军路”。岛上有一条十几里长的海堤，如果疏忽大意被大风浪冲开缺口，堤内上千亩田地和两三个村庄就要被海水淹没。所以，每当台风警报传来的时候，我们就和当地群众联合组成抢险突击队，日夜守卫海堤。去年8月，十二级台风袭来以前，我们和群众一起抢收了全部早稻，并把大批物资运到了安全地带，使人民财产没有受到损失。前年7月大旱，渔民都出海了，家里农活全靠妇女，我们就积极支援抗旱，妇女把水挑到山脚，战士们接过来挑到山顶，许多战士的肩膀压肿了，有的压破了，但是没有一个叫苦的。为了解决天旱缺水的困难，当地公社党委决定修一座大水库。我们连挤出时间从十多里外赶来，投入了修建水库的工程。前年夏天，鱼汛季节快到了，当地捕鱼大队各项工作都准备齐全了，就是缺少打锚绳的鲜毛竹。我们知道后，就请示上级，把自己的鲜毛竹送给了捕鱼大队。渔民超额完成了捕鱼计划，他们送来一张通红的大喜报，上面写着“有了鲜毛竹，才能搞生产，久旱逢甘雨，雪中送暖炭！”我们和群众就像一家人，我们的营房有时成了群众的临时仓库，球场也变成了晒鱼场，推船、晒网、运渔具，哪里需要人，我们的战士就到哪里。
    我们连的有些战士被群众叫做“活着的罗盛教”，他们常常不顾自己的生命危险去抢救遇险群众。1958年8月19日，当地小学校学生徐阿秀在退潮后到海中小岛去砍柴，回家时海潮已涨满了，不小心被海水冲倒卷走了。我们连的炊事班长傅华生闻讯赶来，他不顾风大浪急，也不顾海底的乱礁，纵身跳入大海。当他游到徐阿秀身旁时，已经精疲力尽了。他叫孩子抱着他的腰，拼命在水上挣扎。在这危急的时刻，正在生病休养的战士范顺保也赶来了，他跳下海去，和傅华生各拉着阿秀的一只胳臂游到了岸边。孩子得救了，傅华生、范顺保却昏倒了，身上留下了十四处被暗礁碰撞的创伤。近两年来，我们连的战士先后救了八个人的生命。
    十年来，我们和海岛人民的关系，真像水乳交融一样。每逢渔民出海捕鱼，我们敲锣打鼓欢送他们。渔民丰收归来，军民就开联欢会同庆丰收。群众抢种蟶子，我们停止操课帮助突击。部队施工，当地男女老幼一齐上山支援。我们热爱海岛，热爱海岛人民，我们要和海岛人民紧密地团结在一起，共同建设祖国的海上乐园。
