A new era in which the laboring people study theory

Qiang Xiaochu, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

The era when the laboring people could not study theory is gone forever. The movement of the laboring people, with the working class as its core, to study theory of Marxism-Leninism has entered a new period. We must further guide this movement to develop in depth and breadth, and make it a mass movement. This is the current "new situation, new stage, and new task" on the theoretical front in Heilongjiang Province.

Under the call of the Party to study Marxist-Leninist theory and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, and encouraged and promoted by the comprehensive great leap forward situation in socialist construction, in the second half of 1958, a mass movement of studying Marxist-Leninist theory, centered on studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, emerged among the broad masses of the laboring people in Heilongjiang Province. In order to promote the continuous, extensive, and in-depth development of this movement, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an exhibition of laboring people studying theory, an on-site meeting, and a radio conference, and put forward the call to "set high aspirations, work hard, and climb the ladder of Marxist-Leninist theory," which greatly encouraged and promoted the enthusiasm and initiative of the laboring people in studying theory. Over the past year or so, this movement has achieved great results. At present, the ranks participating in theoretical study are constantly growing on a solid foundation. For example, in the Mudanjiang Cement Plant, not only did the vast majority of workers participate in theoretical study, but most of their family members also participated. With the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, they broke the superstition that the laboring people could not study theory, and broke the mysterious views and inferiority complex about studying theory through their own practice. Many moving model units and model figures in studying theory have emerged throughout the province. Some factories have seen a new atmosphere of "workshops as classrooms, dormitories as study rooms, reading aloud everywhere, and writing articles with a wave of the pen." Many commune members in rural people's communes not only persist in studying, but also use the method of combining learning and application to solve many ideological problems and practical problems in production. In short, wherever the study is good, people's level of political awareness is constantly improving, promoting production and work, just as Marx said: "Theory, once it grips the masses, becomes a material force." It can be said that this study movement is a good start for the laboring people to study theory.

Experience over the past year or so has proved that the laboring people have favorable conditions for studying theory that general intellectuals do not have. Theory comes from the practice of class struggle and production struggle. The laboring people are direct participants and practitioners of these struggles. They have rich and vivid perceptual knowledge and experience, so it is easier to understand the essence of the theory and to closely combine theory with practice and learning with application. The laboring people's movement to study theory has broken out of the narrow circle of a few cadres and intellectuals studying theory. This is a new development of great significance in theoretical education work, and it will have an extremely far-reaching impact on China's socialist construction and even the future communist construction cause.

Now, as China's socialist construction is in a period of rapid development, it is of great significance for the laboring people, especially the working class, to strengthen the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works and the theory of Marxism-Leninism in order to realize China's even more magnificent socialist construction cause in the future. Theory is the guide to action. The purpose of studying theory is to better guide practice and build socialism faster, better, and more economically. Marxism-Leninism is the crystallization of human wisdom. Only by studying and mastering Marxism-Leninism can we improve our awareness, understand the theory of proletarian liberation, and understand the laws of revolutionary struggle and production struggle. Only by applying the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to the reality of China, and using the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of dialectical materialism to understand and solve problems, can we clarify our goals, see the direction of progress, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, distinguish between right and wrong, distinguish between good and bad, true and false, distinguish between primary and secondary, priority and sequence, distinguish between essence and phenomenon, mainstream and tributaries, distinguish between individual and collective, local and overall situation, ... and so on, so as to better implement the Party's general line of socialist construction, give full play to subjective initiative, and greatly accelerate the process of socialist construction. Experience has proved that the higher the theoretical level in production and work, the higher the production and work efficiency, the greater the confidence and enthusiasm in work, the more methods, and the easier it is to overcome difficulties. This is a law.

Studying Marxism-Leninism, especially studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, is another important experience for the laboring people of Heilongjiang Province to study theory. Comrade Mao Zedong combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and creatively applied and developed Marxism-Leninism. In the long history of the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese revolutionary struggle, Comrade Mao Zedong has always represented the correct line, leading the Chinese revolution from one victory to another. Comrade Mao Zedong is a great Marxist-Leninist theorist of our time. His Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method are specifically embodied in the practice of leading the Chinese revolutionary struggle and in his various works. Therefore, studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works is also the most specific and effective way to study Marxist-Leninist theory. The reason why the broad masses of the laboring people love to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works is not only because his works summarize the various important principles of Marxism-Leninism, summarize the various important experiences of the Chinese revolutionary movement, and are the best examples and models of combining theory with practice; but also because his works are easy to understand and easy to understand. As some workers have reflected: "Chairman Mao's words are linked to thoughts and practical work in every sentence," "you can use it immediately after learning it," so "the more you read it, the more you love to read it." It can be seen that studying the Marxist-Leninist principles elucidated by Comrade Mao Zedong with countless vivid facts is of great and practical significance for guiding the current socialist construction of our country. At present, the content of theoretical study in various parts of Heilongjiang Province is generally centered on the Party's general line and Comrade Mao Zedong's works, selecting and reading relevant works by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and closely combining them with the reality of the current political and production movements, studying the Party's major policies and guidelines and relevant important articles in newspapers and theoretical magazines. In this way, it has powerfully promoted the participation of the broad masses of workers in the struggle against right-leaning, to boost morale, and to defend the Party's general line. The workers of the Mudanjiang Cement Plant, in this spirit, have persisted in theoretical study throughout the year. Due to the continuous improvement of their Marxist-Leninist awareness, they timely sniffed out and theoretically refuted various sinister winds and fallacies against the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune Movement. The theoretical study group of workers in the laboratory of the plant conducted debates on the fallacy that "the Great Leap Forward has messed things up," and wrote an article entitled "Sixty Advantages of the Great Leap Forward" by using the method of linking theory with practice, vividly and concretely expounding the great achievements of socialist construction under the brilliant light of the general line. Many workers in the plant also picked up pens and wrote more than 30 theoretical articles such as "Defend the General Line as Protecting Our Own Eyes," "Hold High the Red Flag of the Revolutionary Mass Movement and Forge Ahead Courageously," "The People's Commune Is Good," and "Marxist-Leninists Are Nurturers of New Things," and conducted theoretical struggles against various right-leaning views. A theoretical study group in a people's commune in Hulan County deepened its understanding of the struggle between the two roads in rural areas while studying theory. They theoretically struggled against the thinking of rich peasants, drew a clear line, improved their awareness, overcame right-leaning, increased their enthusiasm, and promoted production. There are many such examples in Harbin and other places.

From the situation in various parts of Heilongjiang Province, the most prominent characteristics of the laboring people, especially the workers, studying theory are that they have clear goals, correct attitudes, correct methods, and are good at uniting theory with practice. They use the theoretical principles they have learned to study and analyze the practical problems in political and production movements; or they raise the practical problems in the Great Leap Forward and production to the height of theory, and adopt the method of guiding reality with theory or discussing theory on the basis of reality to conduct research and discussion. They have used this method of combining theory and reality to solve many important problems in production and work. The whole set of methods that have been effective for more than a year, combining reading, listening to lectures, airing views, debating, examining thoughts, solving problems, summarizing experiences, and writing articles, is also accepting and carrying forward the methods of the Party's rectification study movement. Study mainly relies on personal hard work in reading, but also to organize good collective discussions, in order to inspire each other, exchange experiences, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and improve together. In addition, it is also necessary to do a good job in lecturing and tutoring, which is of extremely important significance for the laboring people to study theory well, especially for those with poor reading ability. The six-character learning method created by the Harbin No. 7 Department Store—learn, ask, think, write, speak, and use—is a very good set of learning methods, and various places are imitating and promoting it. It must be pointed out here: all doctrinaire attitudes and methods of learning that are divorced from reality must be resolutely opposed.

Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Heilongjiang Province's socialist construction is in a new period. The "new situation, new stage, and new tasks" put forward by the Provincial Party Committee require us to better transform the objective world and better transform the subjective world. We must use the ideology of the working class to lead and arm all the laboring people to engage in the great cause of socialist construction. Although our working class is the leading class, the workers themselves must also carry out ideological transformation. This is because non-proletarian people still account for a large proportion in the working class, so they must strive to transform the ideology of the class they originally came from; even if they are hereditary workers, they may be affected by bourgeois ideology, and therefore they must also establish and firm their proletarian world outlook. Only in this way can they consciously defend and implement the Party's general line of socialist construction, and adapt to the needs of the new situation and tasks.

The struggle to build socialism and then communism requires us to cultivate a strong Marxist-Leninist theoretical force. The cultivation of this force must adopt the policy of "walking on two legs." On the one hand, we must systematically train more theoretical talents from cadres and revolutionary intellectuals. On the other hand, we must further widely develop the mass movement of the laboring people to study theory according to the principle of combining popularization and improvement, improve on the basis of popularization, and train a large number of talents with higher theoretical levels from it. At present, the situation of the laboring people in Heilongjiang Province studying theory is very good. In order to mobilize the broad masses to study theory and study it well, and to continuously consolidate and improve on the basis of the achievements already made, we must continue to strengthen the leadership of the Party, further explain the great significance of studying theory to the laboring people, especially to explain the truth that workers and peasants should study theory, must study theory, and can study theory well, further liberate our minds, eliminate superstitions, mysterious views, and feelings of inferiority about studying theory, overcome the emotions of fear of difficulties and relaxation, improve the consciousness of studying theory, and strive to expand the ranks of study and improve the quality of study. Party organizations at all levels must provide assistance in all aspects, timely solve various difficulties and problems, and strengthen specific guidance on learning. We should neither regard the study of theory as very mysterious and unattainable; nor should we regard it as an easy task. After all, studying theory is a kind of arduous mental labor, and it cannot be learned well without hard work. It should be admitted that it is difficult for people with low levels of education to study theory, but this can be solved. At present, the vocational education of workers and staff is developing vigorously throughout the province, and a workers' education network with an initial scale has been established, which has created conditions for further carrying out theoretical study. The era when the laboring people could not study theory is over, and a new era has come for the laboring people to study Marxism-Leninism and climb the peaks of science and technology. Countless facts have proved that the laboring people, especially the working class, can not only learn, but also learn well, speak well, write well, and use well. They are the inventors and creators of countless new things, new technologies, and new experiences. They are the masters of the new society. They will build a beautiful, rich, happy, and powerful socialist motherland with greater ambition and perseverance. Through continuous study and practice, they will definitely grow a combat-effective Marxist-Leninist theoretical force that is closely linked to theory and practice.

The new situation and tasks require us to make up our minds, set high aspirations, work hard, squeeze time, and push the movement of the laboring people to study theory to a new climax with a persistent and tenacious spirit.

    劳动人民学习理论的新时期
    中共黑龙江省委书记　强晓初
    劳动人民不能学习理论的时代已经一去不复返了。以工人阶级为核心的劳动人民学习理论的运动，已经进入了一个新的时期。我们要把这一运动进一步引向深广发展，使其成为全民性的运动。这是当前黑龙江省理论战线上的“新形势、新阶段、新任务”。
    在党的学习马克思列宁主义理论、学习毛泽东同志著作的号召下，在社会主义建设全面大跃进形势的鼓舞与推动下，1958年下半年，黑龙江省的广大劳动人民中，就出现了一个空前的以学习毛泽东同志著作为中心的学习马克思列宁主义理论的群众运动。中共黑龙江省委为了推动这一运动不断向广泛深入发展，曾经举办了劳动人民学习理论展览会和现场会，召开了广播大会，提出“立大志，下苦功，攀登马克思列宁主义理论的阶梯”的号召，大大地鼓舞与促进了劳动人民学习理论的热情与积极性。一年多以来，这个运动已经收到了很大的成绩。目前参加理论学习的队伍正在巩固的基础上不断地发展壮大。例如牡丹江水泥厂，不但绝大多数工人参加了理论学习，而且多数家属也参加了学习。他们以敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，破除了过去那种认为劳动人民不能学习理论的迷信，以亲身实践打破了那种对学习理论的神秘观点与自卑思想。全省出现了许多动人的学习理论的模范单位与模范人物。有些工厂出现了“车间当课堂，宿舍成书房，到处读书声，挥笔写文章”的新气象。不少农村人民公社的社员，不但坚持学习，而且以学用结合的方法解决了许多思想问题和生产中的实际问题。总之，凡是学习好的地方，人们的政治觉悟水平都在不断地提高，促进了生产、推动了工作，正如马克思所说：“理论一掌握了群众，便立刻成为物质的力量”。可以说，这个学习运动，是劳动人民学习理论的一个良好的开端。
    一年多以来的经验证明，劳动人民学习理论，具有一般知识分子所没有的有利条件。理论来源于阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践，劳动人民是这些斗争的直接参加者和实践者，他们有丰富生动的感性知识和经验，所以比较容易理解理论的精神实质，便于把理论和实际、学与用密切地结合起来。劳动人民学习理论运动，冲出了过去少数干部和知识分子学习理论的狭小圈子，这是理论教育工作上具有重大意义的新发展，它对我国的社会主义建设以至将来的共产主义建设事业，都将要发生极其深远的影响。
    现在，我国的社会主义建设正处在飞跃发展的时期，劳动人民首先是工人阶级加强学习毛泽东同志的著作，学习马克思列宁主义理论，对于实现我国今后更加宏伟的社会主义建设事业，意义十分重大。理论是行动的指南，学习理论的目的是为了更好地指导实践，多快好省地建设社会主义。马克思列宁主义是人类智慧的结晶，只有学习和掌握了马克思列宁主义，才能提高自己的觉悟，懂得无产阶级解放的学说，懂得革命斗争和生产斗争的规律。只有将马克思列宁主义的普遍真理应用于中国实际，以辩证唯物主义的立场、观点、方法去认识问题与解决问题，才能使我们明确奋斗的目标，看清前进的方向，在两条道路的斗争中，分清敌我，分清是非，分清好坏、真伪，分清主次、先后，分清本质与现象、主流与支流，分清个人与集体、局部与全局，……等等，从而更好地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，充分地发挥主观能动作用，大大地加速社会主义建设的进程。经验证明，在生产与工作中，理论水平越高，生产与工作效率也就会越高，工作信心和劲头就会越大，办法也就会越多，困难也就越容易被克服。这是一条定律。
    学习马克思列宁主义，特别要学习毛泽东同志的著作，这是黑龙江省劳动人民学习理论的又一重要经验。毛泽东同志把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命实际相结合起来，创造性地运用与发展了马克思列宁主义。在中国共产党领导中国革命斗争的漫长历史中，毛泽东同志始终代表着正确的路线，领导中国革命由一个胜利走向又一个胜利。毛泽东同志是当代伟大的马克思列宁主义理论家，他的马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法，具体地体现在领导中国革命斗争的实践中和他的各种著作中，所以学习毛泽东同志的著作也正是最具体而有效地学习马克思列宁主义理论。广大劳动人民所以非常喜爱学习毛泽东同志的著作，不仅因为他的著作概括了马克思列宁主义的各种重要原理，概括了中国革命运动的各种重要经验，是理论联系实践的最好的典范和榜样；而且还因为他的著作深入浅出，亲切易懂。正如有些工人反映的：“毛主席的话句句联系思想和实际工作”，“学了马上就能用”，因此“越看越爱看”。可见，学习毛泽东同志用无数生动事实所阐明的马克思列宁主义原理，对于指导当前我国的社会主义建设来说，有着非常重大而现实的意义。黑龙江省各地当前学习理论的内容，大体都是以党的总路线和毛泽东同志的著作为中心，选读马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的有关著作，并紧密结合当前政治与生产运动的实际，学习党的重大方针、政策和报纸、理论杂志上的有关重要文章。这样，就有力地推动了广大工人群众参加反右倾、鼓干劲，保卫党的总路线的斗争。牡丹江水泥厂的职工，本着这种精神，常年坚持理论学习，由于马克思列宁主义觉悟不断的提高，他们及时地嗅出了并从理论上驳斥了反对总路线、大跃进、人民公社运动的各种阴风邪气和谬论。该厂化验室工人理论学习小组针对“大跃进搞糟了”的谬论，进行辩论，并用理论联系实际的方法写出了“大跃进好处六十条”的文章，生动而又具体地阐明了在总路线的光辉照耀下，社会主义建设的伟大成就。该厂很多工人还拿起笔来写了：“像保卫自己眼睛一样保卫总路线”、“高举革命的群众运动的红旗奋勇前进”、“人民公社就是好”、“马克思列宁主义者是新事物的抚育者”等三十余篇理论性的文章，同各种右倾观点进行了理论上的斗争。呼兰县一个人民公社的理论学习小组，在学习理论中，加深了对农村两条道路斗争的认识，他们从理论上同富裕中农思想进行了斗争，划清了界限，提高了觉悟，克服了右倾，增加了干劲，推动了生产。像这样的事例在哈尔滨市及其他各地也不少。
    从黑龙江全省各地的情况来看，劳动人民，首先是工人学习理论，最显著的特点是目的明确，态度端正，方法对头，善于把理论和实际统一起来。用学到的理论原理去研究分析政治运动与生产运动中的实际问题；或者将大跃进与生产中的实际问题，提到理论的高度，采取以虚导实或就实论虚的方法进行研究探讨。他们采取这种虚实结合的方法，曾经解决了不少生产和工作上的重要问题。一年多来行之有效的读书、听课、鸣放、辩论、检查思想、解决问题、总结经验和写文章相结合的一整套的方法，也正是接受和发扬了党的整风学习运动的方法。学习主要是靠个人的艰苦努力读书，同时也要组织好集体讨论，以互相启发，交谈心得，取长补短，共同提高。此外，还要做好讲课和辅导，这对于劳动人民学好理论特别对于阅读能力较差的人有极为重要的意义。哈尔滨市第七百货商店创造的六个字的学习方法——学、问、想、写、讲、用，就是一套很好的学习方法，各地正在效仿与推广。这里必须指出：一切脱离实际的教条主义的学习态度和学习方法必须坚决反对。
    在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，黑龙江省社会主义建设正处在一个新的时期，省委提出的“新形势、新阶段、新任务”要求我们必须更好地改造客观世界、更好地改造主观世界。我们要用工人阶级思想领导和武装一切劳动人民去从事伟大的社会主义建设事业。我们工人阶级虽然是领导阶级，但工人本身也必须进行思想改造，这是由于在工人阶级中，非无产阶级出身的人还占着很大的比重，所以必须努力改造他们原来出身的阶级的思想；即或是血统工人，也可能受到资产阶级思想的影响，因而也必须树立与坚定无产阶级的世界观。只有如此，才能自觉地保卫与贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，才能适应新的形势与任务的需要。
    建设社会主义进而建设共产主义的斗争，要求我们培养强大的马克思列宁主义的理论队伍。这个队伍的培养，必须采取“两条腿走路”的方针。一方面要从干部和革命知识分子中有计划地培养更多的理论人材，另方面必须按着普及与提高相结合的原则，进一步广泛开展劳动人民学理论的群众运动，在普及的基础上提高，从中培养大量的、有较高理论水平的人材。当前，黑龙江省劳动人民学习理论的形势是非常好的。为了发动广大群众学习理论和学好理论，在既得成果的基础上不断巩固提高，必须继续加强党的领导，进一步向劳动人民解释学习理论的重大意义，特别是解释工人、农民应该学理论、必须学理论、而且能够学好理论的道理，进一步解放思想，破除对于学习理论的迷信、神秘观点、自卑思想，克服畏难松劲情绪，提高学习理论的自觉性，努力扩大学习队伍，提高学习的质量。党的各级组织要在各方面给以帮助，及时地解决各种困难与问题，加强对学习的具体指导。我们既不要把学习理论看得非常神秘和高不可攀；也不要把它看成是轻而易举的事。因为学习理论毕竟是一种艰苦的脑力劳动，不下苦功夫，是不能学好的。应该承认：文化低的人学理论是有一定的困难的，但是这是可以解决的，目前全省职工业余教育，正在蓬勃发展，已经建立起初具规模的职工教育网，这就为进一步开展理论学习创造了条件。劳动人民不能学习理论的时代已经成为过去了，劳动人民学习马克思列宁主义和攀登科学技术高峰的新时期到来了。无数事实证明，劳动人民，首先是工人阶级不仅能学，而且能学好，能讲好，能写好，能用好。他们是无数新事物、新技术、新经验的发明者、创造者，他们是新社会的主人，他们将要以更大的雄心和毅力建设美丽、富饶、幸福和强大的社会主义祖国，经过不断地学习和实践，一定能生长出一支有战斗力的、理论与实际紧密结合的、马克思列宁主义的理论队伍。
    新的形势与任务要求我们下决心，立大志，下苦功，挤时间，以坚持不懈的顽强精神，把劳动人民学习理论的运动推向一个新的高潮。
