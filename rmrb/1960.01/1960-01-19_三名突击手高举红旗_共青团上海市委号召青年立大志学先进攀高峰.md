Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 17th: To commend the outstanding achievements made by young workers Wang Linhe, Yang Xinfu, and Li Su'lan since the beginning of the new year, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League has decided to name them "Red Flag Youth Shock Workers for a Flying Start in 1960" and called on all young people in the city to learn from their advanced thinking and advanced experience, to set ambitious goals, make innovations, and scale new peaks, launching a new upsurge of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the less advanced."

	Wang Linhe, a young worker with only a junior high school education at the Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory, with the support of the Party and the help of his colleagues, manufactured China's first set of 10,000-volt high-voltage bridges and quickly put them into production. In the past, such high-end, precision products had always been reliant on imports. Wang Linhe, unafraid of difficulties, worked hard and diligently, and after more than a year and 371 experiments, finally succeeded in the trial production.

	Yang Xinfu, a national advanced producer and lathe operator at the Shanglian Electrical Engineering Equipment Factory, recently successfully manufactured a semi-automatic indigenous grinder, which replaced the lathe in processing "core shafts," increasing production efficiency by 364 times. This "core shaft" is a key component of the magnetic contactor switch. Based on the factory's doubled production task this year, Yang Xinfu's lathe team needed to process more than 120,000 "core shafts." At the usual speed, it would take a year and a half to complete. At this time, Yang Xinfu boldly conceived and researched new processing methods. Based on his experience learned at the Shanghai Tool Factory and the Shanghai No. 1 Automotive Gear Manufacturing Factory, he decided to manufacture a semi-automatic indigenous grinder for processing "core shafts," using a grinding wheel to improve production efficiency. His plan was supported by the Party branch in the workshop. With the help of his colleagues, he designed and manufactured it in two days and nights of hard work. This semi-automatic indigenous grinder, with a speed of up to 3,000 revolutions per minute, can process 26 "core shafts" per minute, increasing production efficiency by 364 times compared to lathe processing, and the quality of the processed "core shafts" is also better. The production task that originally required seven workers to complete in a year and a half can now be completed by one person in ten days.

	Li Su'lan is a fine yarn spinning operator at the Shanghai No. 7 Cotton Mill. This national advanced producer and famous spinning expert increased the speed of her fine yarn spinning machine from more than 250 revolutions per minute to 279 revolutions per minute on New Year's Day this year. At the same time, she conscientiously implemented operating procedures, and the unit yield of 42-count double yarn was 15.15 kilograms, reaching the factory's advanced target for the fourth quarter of this year. After creating this achievement, she was not complacent. In the first eight days of this year, she achieved daily red production, and the unit yield of 42-count double yarn reached a maximum of 15.74 kilograms, setting a new city record.

    三名突击手高举红旗
    共青团上海市委号召青年立大志学先进攀高峰
    王林鹤制成第一套一万伏高压电桥
    杨新富一项创造工效猛增三百多倍
    李素兰阔步前进创高速纺纱新纪录
    据新华社上海17日电　共青团上海市委为了表扬青年工人王林鹤、杨新富和李素兰在新年以来作出的优异成绩，决定命名他（她）们为1960年开门红红旗青年突击手，并且号召全市青年学习他（她）们的先进思想和先进经验，立大志、闹革新、攀高峰，掀起一个“比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进”的新高潮。
    只有初中文化程度的沪光科学仪器厂青年工人王林鹤，得到党的支持和职工的帮助，制成我国第一套一万伏高压电桥，并且迅速投入生产。这种高级、精密的产品，过去一向依靠进口。王林鹤不畏困难，刻苦钻研，经过一年多时间，作了三百七十一次试验，终于试制成功。
    全国先进生产者、上联电工器材厂车工杨新富，最近制造成功一台半自动土磨床，代替车床加工“轴芯”，使生产效率提高三百六十四倍。这种“轴芯”，是磁力接触器开关的主要零件。根据这个厂今年生产任务的成倍增长，杨新富所在的车床组需要加工“轴芯”十二万个以上。按通常的速度，要干一年半才能完成。这时候，杨新富大胆设想和研究新的加工方法，他根据在上海工具厂、上海第一汽车齿轮制造厂学到的经验，决定制造一台加工“轴芯”的半自动土磨床，利用砂轮来磨，提高生产效率。他的打算得到了车间党支部的支持。在职工们的帮助下，他经过两昼夜的苦干，便设计制造成功。这台转速高达三千转左右的半自动土磨床，每分钟能加工二十六个“轴芯”，生产效率比用车床加工提高三百六十四倍，加工的“轴芯”质量也更好。原来七个工人要干一年半才能完成的生产任务，现在一个人干十天就可以完成了。
    李素兰是上海第七棉纺厂的细纱挡车工。这个全国先进生产者、著名的纺纱能手，在今年元旦把细纱机车速从原来的二百五十多转提高到二百七十九转，同时认真执行操作法，生产四十二支双股纱单位产量为十五点一五公斤，达到了厂里规定的今年第四季度的跃进指标。在创造这个成绩以后，她不自满，在今年的头八天里，做到了生产日日红，四十二支双股纱单位产量最高达到十五点七四公斤，创造了全市的最新纪录。
