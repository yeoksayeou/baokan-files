    Cheering the Growth of the Technical Strength of the Working Class
    The Jiangxi Daily of January 10th brought great excitement to its readers. That day's newspaper introduced people to an important aspect of socialist construction - the growth of people, the growth of the technical strength of the working class.
    The newspaper used the most prominent position and a large amount of space to report that ten veteran workers, including Hong Jinshui from the Nanchang Railway Bureau, were appointed engineers and were hired as special researchers at the Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The first page published the news, printed congratulatory letters from the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, as well as congratulatory letters from the Provincial Science Association, the Communist Youth League, the Trade Union, and the Women's Federation. It also published a photo of the person in charge of the Jiangxi Branch of the Academy of Sciences presenting letters of appointment to the ten engineers, and wrote an editorial. On the second page, under the banner headline "Establish Lofty Proletarian Aspirations, Climb the Peak of Science and Technology," were published the thoughts written by the ten engineers.
    The reason why the Jiangxi Daily attached great importance to this matter was not only because this event was the glory and pride of the working class, but more importantly, cultivating and promoting engineers from among the workers is an important measure to solve the shortage of technical personnel. The newspaper pointed out that in order to solve the contradiction that the existing technical strength is far from meeting the needs of production and construction, in addition to increasing the number of vocational schools for training, it is necessary to take all effective measures to universally improve the technical and cultural level of the working masses, and to promote outstanding workers to technical leadership positions. The process of Hong Jinshui and other ten veteran workers growing into engineers, and the fact that they solved major technical problems in repairing railway bridges and creating train generators that some engineering technicians could not solve, shows that workers not only have rich practical experience, but also can master theoretical knowledge. The newspaper used this fact to powerfully criticize the bourgeois view that belittles practical knowledge and believes that workers cannot become experts, pointing out that if this view is not thoroughly eliminated, outstanding workers cannot be promoted in large numbers to positions where they can give full play to their talents, and the scientific and technological ranks of the working class cannot be rapidly strengthened.
    On the other hand, the newspaper emphasized through this event that it is necessary to break superstitions and emancipate the mind. The newspaper's editorial said that among the working people, due to the influence of the propaganda of the ruling class in the old society, many people also have superstitious ideas and regard science and technology as unattainable. The fact that ten veteran railway workers, including Hong Jinshui, became engineers will help people to emancipate their minds. The articles published by the ten engineers kindly told readers how they have been continuously improved politically and technically under the care of the Party; although they have mastered some technologies and achieved some achievements, they are never complacent. Tang Chengao, a bridge engineer who came from a road maintenance worker, proposed that in order to improve the quality of bridges, he should further study and solve the problems of eliminating the loosening of rivets on steel beams, straightening the bending of steel beams, improving the decay of bridge sleepers, and appraising the load-bearing capacity of steel beams. Tao Chaozhu, a maintenance engineer who was originally a fitter, said that he would start by reforming the cumbersome tools currently used in maintenance work and strive towards the goal of mechanization and automation. Their ambition and their daring style will be a great encouragement to all workers.
    It can be seen that this report organized by the Jiangxi Daily is not only of guiding significance for practical work, but also rich in ideological content. (Attached picture)

### 欢呼工人阶级技术力量的成长

    欢呼工人阶级技术力量的成长
    1月10日的江西日报带给读者巨大的兴奋。这一天的报纸向人们介绍了社会主义建设中一个重要方面的成就——人的成长，工人阶级技术力量的成长。
    报纸用最显著的地位和很大的篇幅，报道南昌铁路局洪锦水等十名老工人荣任工程师，并被聘为中国科学院江西分院特约研究员。一版发表了消息，登出了中共江西省委、省人委的贺信和省科协、团委、工会、妇联的贺信，刊载了科学院江西分院负责人向十位工程师送聘书的照片，而且写了社论。在二版以“立无产阶级大志，登科学技术高峰”作为通栏标题，刊出了十位工程师写的感想。
    江西日报所以十分重视这件事，不仅因为这件事情是工人阶级的光荣和骄傲，更重要的，从工人中培养和提升工程师，是解决技术力量不足的重要措施。报纸指出为了解决现有技术力量远远不能满足生产建设需要的矛盾，除了增办各种专业学校进行培训外，就是要采取一切有效办法，普遍提高工人群众的技术文化水平，并把优秀的工人提拔到技术领导岗位上来。洪锦水等十名老工人成长为工程师的过程，他们在抢修铁路桥梁、创制列车发电机等方面解决了某些工程技术人员未能解决的重大技术问题的事实，说明工人不仅有丰富的实践经验，而且能够掌握理论知识。报纸用这个事实有力地批判了那种轻视实践知识认为工人不能成专家的资产阶级观点，指出这种观点如果不彻底加以肃清，优秀工人就不能大量地提升到充分发挥他们才能的岗位上来，工人阶级的科学技术队伍就不可能迅速地壮大。
    另一方面，报纸通过这件事着重宣传了必须破除迷信、解放思想。报纸的社论说，在劳动人民当中，由于受了旧社会统治阶级宣传的影响，也有不少人有迷信思想，把科学技术看得高不可攀。洪锦水等十名铁路老工人当工程师这件事情，将能帮助人们解放思想。报纸发表的十位工程师的文章，亲切地告诉读者，他们在党的关怀下如何从政治上和技术上不断得到提高；他们虽然已经掌握了一些技术，取得了一些成就，但是决不自满。养路工出身的桥梁工程师唐承鳌，提出为了提高桥梁质量，他要进一步研究解决消灭钢梁铆钉松动、整直钢梁弯曲、改善桥枕腐朽和鉴定钢梁载重等问题。钳工出身的检修工程师陶朝珠，表示他要从改革目前检修工作中的笨重工具着手，向机械化自动化的目标努力。他们的雄心壮志，他们敢想敢做的风格，对于所有的工人都将是极大的鼓舞。
    可以看出，江西日报组织的这次报道，不仅对实际工作有指导意义，也富于思想性。（附图片）
