　　Daughter Plays Mom
　　Zhang Ke

　　My daughter had only eaten one bowl of rice, and didn't want to add more after putting down her bowl. Mom asked, "Are you sick?" "No, we're putting on a play tonight." "No wonder you've been setting up the stage all night! Are you participating in the play this time?" "It's my first time on stage, and I'm afraid I won't perform well. I can't eat because my heart is pounding." "Who are you playing? You need to act seriously." "The person I'm playing is the best! Mom, you'll know when you go see it." "Okay, you quickly help me wash the dishes, or it will be too crowded if we go late." "After I wash the dishes, I'll go put on makeup. Mom, find a place to sit." The audience stared intently at the stage. The gong sounded three times, and the curtain opened. The announcer said, "Tonight we're performing 'Model Old Lady'." Mom clapped hard. "Which old lady became a model and even had a play written about her for everyone to see?" Mom asked, and everyone just laughed. "Look! 'Old Lady' is coming out." On stage, the daughter played Mom. Under the stage, Mom laughed and "scolded": "That damned girl, what are you doing? You're imitating my walk and speech on stage." After the play, the two "Old Ladies" met, and all that could be heard was "Mom" and "Daughter" being called affectionately. The audience didn't disperse, layer upon layer. The play turned into reality!

    女儿演妈妈
    张克女儿才吃一碗饭，放下饭碗不想添。妈问：“你可是生病？”“不，我们今晚要演戏。”“怪不得连夜把戏台搭！这回演戏有你参加？”“头一回上台怕演不好，吃不下饭心里跳。”“你是装的什么人？演戏要演正经的。”“我饰的人最最好，妈妈去看就知道。”“好嘛，你快帮我把碗洗，去得晚了人太挤。”“洗完碗我就去化装，妈妈去找个坐的地方。”观众两眼盯戏台，锣响三遍幕分开。报幕的说“今晚演‘模范大娘’”，妈妈使劲使劲拍巴掌。“是哪个大娘当了模范，还编成戏演给大家看？”妈妈问人人光笑：“快看！‘大娘’出来了。”台上女儿演妈妈，台下妈妈笑又“骂”：“该死的丫头你在做啥？戏台上学我走路又讲话。”演完戏两个“大娘”来相会，只听得娘呀儿呀喊的亲。观众层层不散开，演戏演出真的来！
