    People Transporting Dolomite
    Shan Feng
    Dawn illuminates the mountains, another morning arrives.
    On the mountain road surrounded by peaks, trucks bathed in the morning sun speed towards the depths of the mountains. I hurried in the direction the trucks were coming from, entering the Tuoli Motor Pool.
    A large group of workers in oilskins surrounded the propaganda area east of the motor pool entrance, vying to see a production bulletin that was still wet with paste. From the back, I could only see a few striking characters on the bulletin: Fight the Dolomite Mountain, Daily Output Exceeds the 1,000-Ton Mark. On the walls on both sides of the bulletin were also pasted resolutions and countless red and green big-character posters. Eager to learn about the increase production and practice economy campaign from the Party Branch Secretary, I had to postpone reading these for later.
    Arriving at the Branch office, I knocked on the door, but there was no answer. Was I too early? Had the Party Branch Secretary not come to work yet? Perhaps… As I hesitated, a question from a young worker interrupted my thoughts:
    "Comrade, are you looking for the Party Branch Secretary? He's not home."
    "Oh, do you know where he went?"
    "That's hard to say, these days even when he's at home, he rarely sits in the office."
    "Is the director in?"
    "The director isn't in either," he shook his head. "All the leaders of our motor pool have gone to the front lines, guarding the passes; the director is currently directing vehicles to assault the dolomite!"
    The young man seemed to see that I was anxious and said, "Comrade, there's someone in the director's office; they might know when the secretary and director will be back."
    I went into the director's office. The person who greeted me said, "The secretary and director went to the dolomite mountain last night. Transporting dolomite is a difficult political task, and they are on the dolomite mountain day and night, so it's hard to say when they'll be back."
      The word "dolomite" was new to me. The workers and cadres here talk about dolomite, the secretary and director are also guarding the dolomite, and the resolutions and big-character posters are all written for the battle for dolomite. To be honest, I really didn't know what dolomite was for, and I thought it was for flood control, so I asked offhandedly: "Isn't the flood season over? Why are so many trucks hauling big rocks?"
    "No, you're mistaken!" the comrade who received me said seriously, "Dolomite isn't big rocks for flood control and repairing dams, it's a rock used for steelmaking, an essential food for the steel commander."
    As he was speaking, suddenly a young man barged in. He yelled at the top of his lungs: "Why isn't the director back yet?"
    "What's the matter?"
    "What's the matter? I'm still requesting a vehicle!"
    "Your health hasn't been very good these past few days, didn't the director want you to rest?"
    The young man waved his arm, revealing an attitude of complete indifference, saying, "Don't listen to what the director said, my health is great!"
    "No, the director said you must rest for two days."
    "Xiao, I really don't want to rest! Everyone is working hard to achieve a good start in 1960. I don't want to stay at home," the young man said anxiously, hurriedly explaining.
    It seemed that Xiao was moved, but he still deliberately kept a straight face, saying:
    "The director and secretary aren't home, I can't make the decision."
    "Hey! Don't bluff me! I'm just informing the director and secretary, I'm going to do it. Actually, the secretary and director only know how to take care of others, but they are on the front lines day and night..."
    The young man's words amused Xiao. Just then, a cook in a white work uniform, in his fifties, walked in and said to Xiao:
    "Comrade Xiao Ping, the food to be sent to the front lines is ready, there's a newly repaired truck going to the dolomite mountain, but there's no driver, what do you think we should do?"
    Hearing this, the young man hurriedly said, "Old Zhao, I'll take you!" He turned to look at Xiao, then grabbed the cook and ran out.
    Xiao chased after him and said, "The driving thing still needs to be decided after the secretary and director come back."
    I followed the food delivery truck driven by the young man to the dolomite mountain. I found the secretary, who was loading the trucks, in the crowd.
    The dolomite-covered mountains emitted a dazzling light under the sun.

    运送白云石的人们
    山峰
    曙光照耀着群山，早晨又来临了。
    在群山环抱着的山区公路上，披着朝霞的汽车飞驰着，奔向山的深处。我朝着汽车驶出的方向快步走去，进入了坨里汽车场。
    汽车场门口东面的宣传园地，围着一大堆身穿油衣服的工人，争着在看一张浆糊还没有干的生产捷报。我从后面只看到捷报上的几个醒目大字：大战白云石山，日产破千吨关。捷报两旁的墙壁上，也贴满了决心书和数不清的红红绿绿的大字报。我急于找党支书了解增产节约运动情况，只得一会儿再来看这些了。
    来到支部办公室，我敲了敲门，里面没有人回答。我来得太早了，党支书可能还没有上班？也许……我正在迟疑，忽然，一个青年工人的问话打断了我的思路：
    “同志，找党支书吗？他不在家。”
    “哦，你知道上哪儿去吗？”
    “这可说不清，这些日子即便在家也很少坐在办公室里。”
    “场长在家吗？”
    “场长也不在，”他摇了摇头，“我们场的领导干部都下现场，分关把口去了；场长这会儿正指挥车辆突击白云石呢！”
    青年人似乎看出了我很着急，说：“同志，场长办公室有人，书记、场长什么时候回来，也许会知道。”
    我走进了场长办公室。接待我的人说：“书记、场长昨天夜里就到白云石山去了。运送白云石是艰巨的政治任务，他们整天整夜都在白云石山上，什么时候回来可没准儿。”
      “白云石”这个字眼儿，在我的脑子里是个新鲜的东西。这里的工人、干部开口就是白云石，书记、场长也守着白云石，决心书、大字报都写着为白云石而战。说老实话，白云石到底是干什么的，我真不知道，还以为是防汛用的呢，就信口开河地问：“汛期不是已经过去了吗？干嘛还派那么多车拉大石头？”
    “不，你闹错了！”接待我的同志认真地说：“白云石不是防汛修水坝的大石头，是炼钢用的石头，是钢帅必需的食粮。”
    正说着，突然一个小伙子闯进来。扯开嗓子嚷道：“场长怎么还不回来呀？”
    “有什么事？”
    “什么事？还是请求出车！”
    “你这几天身体不大好，场长不是要你休息吗？”
    小伙子挥了一下胳膊，露出一副毫不在乎的神气说：“你别听场长说的，我的身体可好啦！”
    “不，场长说一定要你休息两天。”
    “小肖，我实在不愿意休息！大家正在鼓足干劲，实现1960年开门红。我可不愿意呆在家里。”小伙子急了，急急地剖白。
    看样子小肖被说动了，但他却还故意绷住脸，说：
    “场长、书记不在家，我作不了主。”
    “嘿！你不要唬我！我是向场长、书记打个招呼，我是去定啦。其实呀，书记、场长也是只知道照顾别人，自己却是日夜不离现场。……”
    这小伙子的一番话，把小肖逗笑了。正在这时，一个穿着白色工作服，五十多岁的炊事员走进来，对小肖说：
    “肖平同志，送到现场去的饭已经做好了，有一个刚修好的车要到白云石山去，就是没有司机开车，你看怎么办？”
    这个小伙子听说，急忙说：“老赵头，我送你去！”他回头看了看小肖，就拉起炊事员跑了出去。
    小肖追出来说：“开车的事还得等书记、场长回来再决定。”
    我随着小伙子驾驶的送饭汽车，来到了白云石山上。在人群中找到了正在装车的书记。
    满山的白云石，在阳光下发出耀眼的光芒。
