    Great Ambition Breeds Great Courage
    Jing Yu
    As we enter the first month of the 1960s, what is the most exciting thing in our hearts regarding the cause of socialist construction?
    Perhaps you would answer: It's the countless "red starts." A red start in steel, a red start in coal, a red start in this enterprise, a red start in that enterprise, and so on. Perhaps you would say that it is not just those glowing reports of victory, but also the countless innovators who are particularly inspiring. The indomitable will they demonstrate in overcoming difficulties, and the new contributions they make for the new year. Here, some succeeded after several failures, and some succeeded after dozens or even hundreds of failures. Perhaps you want to find a general term, saying that what excites us most is those people with great ambitions, who dare to think, dare to act, and leap forward at high speed.
    Yes, their deeds are exciting, and they are the most beloved people. Their tenacious character of climbing peaks is the noblest style. All their innovations and creations, large and small, are the material forces for the rapid advancement of socialism. The most fundamental reason why our socialist construction can develop at high speed lies in the tremendous superiority of our social system. One manifestation of this superiority is that it can fully encourage and develop people's subjective initiative and cultivate people's lofty communist style. That is, the communist style of breaking superstitions, liberating thoughts, daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act.
    Wang Linhe, a 29-year-old young worker in a small Shanghai alley factory, is a person with a communist style. This young man, who originally only had a junior high school education, under the illumination of the Party's General Line, set a lofty ambition to trial-produce a "10,000-volt high-voltage bridge." In the process of trial production, he encountered 370 failures, demonstrated a spirit of fearlessness, and finally overcame numerous difficulties, filling an important gap in China's instrument industry. Mao Amao, a worker at the Machinery Branch of the Tongjialiang Mine in Datong Coal Mine, is also a person with a communist style. This ordinary worker, who is not very literate and not highly educated, although he has never done design work, but because he has a revolutionary will tempered through hardships and a fervent desire to create, after three years of struggle, he finally manufactured a coal loading machine to replace manual coal loading. In addition, there are many other people with a communist style, and their creations have all gone through difficult journeys, which will not be listed one by one here.
    What kind of feelings will it evoke in some lazy people and cowards when a new tool has to go through so many failures from the beginning of trial production to the final success? Perhaps he has never thought about it. Perhaps, even though he has thought about it, he thinks about the difficulties and some issues of personal gain and loss: "Dare to think, dare to speak, what if I think or say something wrong?" "Wouldn't it be a loss of personal dignity if I don't think well or do well?" "Since things are so difficult, it's better not to do it." And so on. Because this kind of person's thinking is dominated by individualism in everything, the result is that he can only fall into a state of not daring to think, not daring to speak, and not daring to act. Society has advanced, the cause has advanced, and many people around him have advanced, but he is always "hesitating when his feet are about to move, and stammering when his mouth is about to speak," and even sighing and complaining that his brain is too stupid. May I ask, if this kind of lazy and cowardly person's worldview is not changed, how can his brain become smart?
    The communist style is the style of the Mao Zedong era, and it is a noble manifestation of the spirit of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Although our country is economically backward and has a poor foundation, with the Party's General Line and a large number of advanced individuals with a communist style who are striving to become strong under the illumination of the General Line, our socialist construction cause will advance rapidly. The heroic figures and innovations that have emerged on all fronts in the first month of the 1960s are another new and great beginning. In order to rapidly build our country into a modern and great socialist power in the shortest possible time, our Party, our motherland, needs thousands upon thousands of people who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, needs thousands upon thousands of people who break superstitions, create and innovate, and needs thousands upon thousands of people who are not afraid of difficulties, do not care about gains and losses, and have great revolutionary spirit.
    The communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act is also a noble manifestation of the spiritual outlook of proletarian revolutionaries and a product of the proletarian worldview. In the torrent of vigorously carrying out mass movements and vigorously engaging in technological innovation, we must resolutely eliminate all the worldviews of lazy people and cowards, and further promote the proletarian worldview and communist style. Great ambition breeds great courage. Only by establishing great ambitions can we dare to make great innovations and tenaciously climb the peaks of science and technology.

    有大志才有大勇
    静宇
    当跨入六十年代头一个月的时候，在社会主义建设事业里，最引起我们内心激动的事是什么呢？
    也许，你会这样回答：是数不尽的“开门红”。钢铁开门红，煤炭开门红，这个企业开门红，那个企业开门红，等等。也许，你会说，不仅仅那些一片红光的捷报，特别扣人心弦的还有那些数不尽的革新能手。他们为了克服困难所表现的顽强意志，以及他们为新的一年所作出的新的贡献。这里，有经过几次失败而达到成功的，也有经过几十次成百次失败而达到成功的。也许，你想找一个概括性的词儿，说，最使我们内心激动的就是那些具有雄心壮志、敢想、敢干，而高速度跃进的人们。
    是的，他们的事迹是令人激动的，他们是最可爱的人。他们那种攀登高峰的顽强性格是最高贵的风格。他们的一切大大小小的革新和创造，是社会主义高速前进的物质力量。我国社会主义建设所以能够高速度向前发展，最根本的原因，在于我们的社会制度有着巨大的优越性。这种优越性的表现之一，就是它能充分激励和发挥人们的主观能动性培养人们的崇高的共产主义风格。即是说，破除迷信、解放思想、敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。
    上海一家小弄堂工厂的二十九岁的青年工人王林鹤，是一个具有共产主义风格的人。这个原来只有初中文化水平的青年，在党的总路线照耀下，立下了雄心壮志，试制“一万伏高压电桥”。在试制过程中，遭到三百七十次失败，表现了大无畏的精神，终于战胜了重重困难，填补了我国仪表工业上一项重要空白。大同煤矿同家梁矿机械分厂的工人毛阿毛，也是一个具有共产主义风格的人。这个识字不多、文化不高的普通工人，虽然从来没有搞过设计，但是，由于他具有千锤百炼的革命意志，和火热的创造心愿，经过三年的奋斗，终于制成了装煤机代替了人工装煤。此外，还有许许多多具有共产主义风格的人，他们的创造都经历了艰难途程，这里不一一列举了。
    一件新工具从开始试制到最后成功要经过那么多次失败，这对某些懒汉和懦夫会发生一些什么感想呢？也许，他从来就没有想过。也许，他虽则想过，却想的是困难和个人得失的一些问题：“敢想、敢说，万一想错了说错了怎么办呢？”“想得不好、做得不好，不是有失个人体面吗？”“既然事情那么困难，还是不干的好。”等等。由于这种人思想上处处受到个人主义的支配，结果就只好陷于不敢想、不敢说、不敢做的境地。社会前进了，事业前进了，周围的许多人前进了，而他却老是“足将行而踟蹰、口将言而嗫嚅”，甚至唉声叹气，埋怨自己的脑子太笨。试问，这种懒汉和懦夫的世界观不改变，他的脑子又怎么能聪明起来呢？
    共产主义风格是毛泽东时代的风格，是党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线精神的崇高表现。我们的国家虽然经济落后、基础很差，但是，有了党的总路线和总路线照耀下具有共产主义风格的大批发愤图强的先进人物，我们的社会主义建设事业就会飞快前进。在六十年代的头一个月各个战线上所涌现出的英雄人物和革新创造，正是又一个新的伟大的开端。为了在最短期间迅速地把我国建成现代化的伟大的社会主义强国，我们的党、我们的祖国，需要千千万万敢想、敢说、敢做的人，需要千千万万破除迷信、创造革新的人，需要千千万万不怕困难、不计较得失、具有伟大革命气概的人。
    敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，又是无产阶级革命者精神面貌的崇高表现，是无产阶级世界观的产物。在大搞群众运动、大闹技术革新的洪流里，我们要坚决打掉一切懒汉和懦夫的世界观，进一步发扬无产阶级世界观和共产主义风格。有大志才有大勇。只有立定大志，才能敢于大闹革新，顽强地攀登科学技术的高峰。
