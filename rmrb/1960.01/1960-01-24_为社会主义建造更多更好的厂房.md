    Build More and Better Factories for Socialism
    Yu Qinghe Bricklaying Youth Shock Brigade, Beijing Second Construction Company
    We were extremely excited when we heard the 1959 National Economic Communiqué. We cheered the completion of the Five-Year Plan in two years and hailed the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Last year, our shock brigade also overfulfilled its construction tasks by 73.2%, with over 90% of the quality reaching excellent grade. All of this is thanks to the good leadership of the Party, which has kept us motivated and full of fighting spirit.

    This year is a year of continued overall leap forward. In the new year, we guarantee to double production efficiency compared to the quota; guarantee to clean up after finishing work, achieving planned material usage and saving materials; guarantee that over 90% of the project quality reaches excellent grade, and strive to eliminate work-related injuries, aiming for an all-round success in quality, high output, savings, and safety.

    Our slogan is: "Step up when facing difficulties, yield when seeing honor, learn from the advanced, and help the backward." We will always listen to the Party, always be the vanguard of the Great Leap Forward, and build more and better factories for socialism.

    为社会主义建造更多更好的厂房
    北京市第二建筑公司于清和瓦工青年突击队
    我们听到1959年国民经济新闻公报，真是兴奋极了。我们欢呼五年计划两年完成，欢呼毛泽东思想的胜利。我们突击队在去年也超额73．2％完成了建设任务，质量有90％以上达到优等。这些都是党领导得好，才使我们一直干劲冲天，斗志旺盛。
    今年是继续全面跃进的一年。在新的一年里，我们保证生产效率比定额翻一番；保证活完脚下清，做到计划用料，节约材料；保证90％以上的工程质量达到优等，并且要消灭工伤事故，争取优质、高产、节约、安全全面满堂红。
    我们的行动口号是：“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮。”我们永远听党的话，永远当跃进的尖兵，为社会主义建造更多更好的厂房。
