Always Be a Vanguard in Forestry Production
Ma Yongshun, Head of the Logging Team, Yijimi Forest Farm, Tieli Forestry Bureau, Heilongjiang

    The year 1959 has been successfully passed. In this year, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, our team worked hard and cleverly, overfulfilling the production task every month and completing the annual plan more than three months ahead of schedule. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the comrades in our team successfully improved tools such as the "large-toothed saw" and "oil saw starter," and improved several operating methods, averaging an efficiency increase of 15% to 20%. We also trained more than one hundred new workers for our bureau and fraternal forestry bureaus.
    Over the past year, our team has been able to make some achievements in production, which is the result of the Party's wise leadership. We must resolutely hold high the red flag of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, always be a vanguard on the forestry front, and guarantee monthly red and full red achievements in 1960, to achieve continuous leaps forward.
    In 1960, our team will focus on harvesting logs, vigorously engage in the chemical production of forest products and diversified operations, so that the team will gradually move from single timber production to multi-variety production. The targets proposed by our team of fifteen people are: In terms of timber production: 90,000 cubic meters of logs and 105,000 cubic meters of timber. In terms of diversified operations: harvest 30 tons of pine resin, 1 ton of rosin, and 1 ton of tree seeds; plant 2 hectares of vegetable plots, and raise 15 pigs. In addition, we will produce 1,800 pieces of agricultural tool materials (hoe handles, knife handles, hammer handles, etc.) to support agricultural production.
    In order to achieve the above objectives, the specific measures we will take are: First, adhere to putting politics in command, let ideology lead the way, constantly improve awareness, always listen to the Party, adhere to regular political study and democratic life meetings, help each other, strengthen unity, and advance together. Second, vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution. Further research and reform tools, and fully realize mechanized operations on the basis of mechanization and semi-mechanized operations. Adhere to methods such as amateur technical research, and train one hundred new workers in 1960. Third, actively participate in the red flag competition movement for increasing production and practicing economy. Discuss and formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy on a monthly basis, and carry out large-scale competitions within the team. In the competition, continue to promote the spirit of communist cooperation, and drive three backward work teams to reach advanced levels. Strengthen the maintenance of oil saws and machinery, implement the forestry harvesting policy, and achieve increased production and economy. Fourth, conscientiously implement operating procedures and various safety regulations. Fifth, vigorously engage in diversified operations. Carry out a no-empty-handed movement, adopt methods such as finding during work and carrying along after work, and vigorously collect pine resin and rosin. Mobilize family members to participate in diversified operations, acting as breeders or participating in forage collection. Sixth, actively participate in spare-time cultural learning, eliminate illiteracy in the group by the end of February 1960, and everyone strive to be a laborer with cultural accomplishments and a high degree of political awareness.
    We are willing to join hands and work shoulder to shoulder with fraternal logging teams across the country, hold high the red flag of the General Line, and strive to achieve continuous leaps forward in 1960.

    永远作林业生产的尖兵
    黑龙江铁力林业局依吉密林场伐木工组长　马永顺
    1959年胜利地度过了。在这一年里，我们小组在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，苦干巧干，生产月月超额完成任务，提前三个多月完成了年计划。我们小组的同志在技术革新和技术革命运动中，改进成功了“大齿锯”、“油锯起动器”等工具，改进了几种操作方法，平均提高效率15％到20％。我们还为本局和兄弟林业局培训了一百多名新工人。
    一年来，我们小组能在生产上作出一些成绩，是党的英明领导的结果。我们要坚决把总路线、大跃进的红旗高高举起，永远作林业战线上的尖兵，在1960年里保证做到月月红、满堂红，实现继续跃进。
    在1960年内，我们小组要以元条采伐为中心，大搞林产化学生产和多种经营，使小组由单一木材生产逐步走向多品种生产。我们小组十五个人提出的指标是：在木材生产方面：元条采伐九万立米，元木采伐十万五千立米。在多种经营方面：采松明子三十吨，采松脂一吨，采树籽一吨；种菜地两垧，养猪十五口。另外要生产农具材一千八百件（锄杆、刀把、锤把等），支援农业生产。
    为实现上述指标，我们采取的具体措施是：一、坚持政治挂帅，思想先行，不断提高觉悟，永远听党的话，坚持经常性的政治学习和民主生活会，互相帮助，增强团结，共同前进。二、大搞技术革新和技术革命。进一步研究改革工具，要在机械化、半机械化作业的基础上，全部实现机械化作业。坚持业余技术研究等方法，在1960年内培养一百名新工人。三、积极参加增产节约红旗竞赛运动。按月讨论和制订增产节约计划，在组内开展大比大赛。竞赛中继续发扬共产主义协作精神，要带动三个后进的工组达到先进水平。加强油锯、机械保养工作，贯彻执行林业采伐政策，作到增产节约。四、认真贯彻执行操作规程和各项安全制度。五、大搞多种经营。开展不空手运动，采取上班找、下班捎等办法，大力采集松明子、松脂。发动家属参加多种经营，充当饲养员或参加采饲料工作。六、积极参加业余文化学习，在1960年2月末扫除本组的文盲，人人争取作个具有文化修养和高度政治觉悟的劳动者。
  我们愿与全国各兄弟采伐工组手携手，肩并肩，高举总路线的红旗，为实现1960年的继续跃进而努力奋斗。
