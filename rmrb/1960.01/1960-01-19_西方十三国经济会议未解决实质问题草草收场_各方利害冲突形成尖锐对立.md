    Western Thirteen-Nation Economic Conference Ends Hastily Without Resolving Substantive Issues
    Conflicting Interests Form Sharp Opposition
    (Comprehensive report from this newspaper) The five countries of the West European "Free Trade Association" seven, led by Britain, the five countries of the West European "Common Market" six-nation group, led by West Germany and France, and the United States, Canada and Greece, held a Western thirteen-nation economic conference in Paris from the 12th of this month. After three days of arguing, the meeting ended in the early hours of the 14th.
    The convening of this meeting was mainly to discuss the sharp conflicts among Western countries surrounding trade issues, especially the establishment of two opposing trade blocs in Western Europe, and their "aid" and "cooperation" issues for underdeveloped countries.
    At the meeting, a deadlock once emerged because the United States and the "Common Market" countries did not support the proposal put forward by Britain: "The meeting should focus on building a 'bridge' between the 'Common Market' and the 'Little Free Trade Area', and everything else should depend on this need." In addition, the United States' demand that the countries of these two groups unilaterally ease import restrictions on American goods and that they bear more "aid" to underdeveloped countries also caused controversy.
    In the context of complex and profound contradictions among the United States, the Six, and the Seven, the meeting finally did not resolve any substantive issues, but only made decisions on a series of procedural issues that were beneficial to the United States. Three resolutions were adopted, deciding:
    1. To establish the organization proposed by the United States to replace the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau," and a three-person committee composed of representatives from the United States, Britain, and France will draft the charter of this organization and submit it to the twenty-nation conference of the eighteen member states of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" plus the United States and Canada, to be held in Paris on April 19.
    2. A group composed of eight countries, including the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Canada, Italy, Belgium, and Portugal, and representatives of the West European "Common Market" group will study the "technical" issues of "promoting" the provision of "long-term (aid) funds" to underdeveloped countries.
    3. It is emphasized that the issue of studying the relationship between the two opposing economic blocs in Western Europe must be considered as "a primary issue," but when considering this issue, "due consideration" should be given to "the commercial interests of third-party countries (outside the two blocs)." To this end, it is recommended that a committee composed of the eighteen countries of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" and the United States, Canada, and representatives of the West European "Common Market" be established to study this issue. This committee will "establish some informal working groups" and invite representatives from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade organization, which is dominated by the United States, to participate in the discussion.
    Western news agencies have pointed out that this complex organizational form aims to satisfy the United States' request to put the contradictions between the two Western European groups into a "broader" scope for discussion, and also to satisfy Britain's proposal to limit the fundamental negotiations to the two groups, as indicated by the establishment of informal working groups.
    In this way, the Western countries ended another round of confrontation without resolving any substantive issues, and they will continue to fight in the newly established organizations.

### 西方十三国经济会议未解决实质问题草草收场  各方利害冲突形成尖锐对立

    西方十三国经济会议未解决实质问题草草收场
    各方利害冲突形成尖锐对立
    本报综合报道　以英国为首的西欧“自由贸易联盟”七国中的五国，以西德、法国为首的西欧“共同市场”六国集团中的五国以及美国、加拿大和希腊，从本月12日起在巴黎举行了西方十三国经济会议。经过三天的争吵后会议于14日凌晨结束。
    这次会议的召集主要为了讨论西方国家围绕着贸易问题、特别是西欧两个对垒的贸易集团的成立引起的尖锐冲突以及它们对不发达国家的“援助”“合作”问题。
    会上由于美国和“共同市场”国家不支持英国提出的主张：“会议应以建立‘共同市场’和‘小自由贸易区’之间的‘桥梁’为主，其他一切都应决定于这个需要”，因此一度出现僵局。另外，美国要这两个集团的国家实行单方面放宽对美国货的入口限制，并要它们多担负对不发达国家的“援助”，也引起了争论。
    在美国、六国和七国三方面错综复杂深刻矛盾的情况下，会议终于没有解决任何实质问题，而仅仅就一系列程序性问题作出了有利于美国的决定。通过了三项决议，决定：
    一、成立美国所建议的接替“欧洲经济合作局”的组织，由美英法三国代表组成的三人委员会来草拟这个组织的章程，提交4月19日在巴黎举行的“欧洲经济合作局”十八个成员国加上美国、加拿大两国的二十国会议决定。
    二、由美、英、法、西德、加拿大、意大利、比利时和葡萄牙等八个国家和西欧“共同市场”集团的代表组成一个小组研究“促进”向不发达国家提供“长期性（援助）款项”的“技术”问题。
    三、强调必须把研究西欧两个对立的经济集团之间的关系问题当作“一个首要的问题”来考虑，但在考虑这个问题时要“对（两个集团以外的）第三方面国家的商业利益有应有的照顾”。为此建议成立一个由“欧洲经济合作局”十八国和美国、加拿大以及西欧“共同市场”的代表一起组成的委员会来研究这个问题，这个委员会将“建立一些非正式的工作小组”并约请美国支配的关税贸易总协定组织的代表来参加讨论。
    西方通讯社已指出，这样复杂的组织形式目的在于既满足美国要求把西欧两个集团之间的矛盾放到“更广泛”的范围之中去讨论的意见，又在建立非正式的工作小组这一点上满足英国主张把基本性的谈判限于两个集团之间的意见。
    这样，西方国家在没有解决任何一个实质问题的情况下结束了又一个回合的交锋，它们将在新成立的一些组织中再继续角斗。
