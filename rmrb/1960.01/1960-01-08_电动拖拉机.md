    Electric Tractor
    China's first electric tractor with a power of 28 kilowatts has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Songjiang Tractor Factory in Harbin. After trial operation, its performance proved to be good.
    This tractor can plough ten mu of land per hour with a three-bottom plow, and the power consumption per mu is 4.7 kilowatt-hours, with a cost only equivalent to one-fifth of that of a diesel tractor.
    The tractor's power distribution car is equipped with a self-contained transformer that can change the voltage at any time according to the needs of the tractor, so it can be used wherever there is a power supply. It has a 540-meter-long cable, which can ensure that the tractor moves and operates in a larger area.

    电动拖拉机
    我国第一台功率为二十八瓩的电动拖拉机最近在哈尔滨松江拖拉机制造厂试制成功。经过试运转证明，性能良好。
    这台拖拉机牵引一部三铧犁，每小时可耕地十亩，每亩地耗电量为四点七度，成本只相当于柴油拖拉机的五分之一。
    拖拉机的配电车上设有自备变压器，能够根据拖拉机的需要随时改变电压，因此凡有电源的地方都可以使用。它带有五百四十米长的电缆线，可以保证拖拉机在较大的面积内移动作业。
