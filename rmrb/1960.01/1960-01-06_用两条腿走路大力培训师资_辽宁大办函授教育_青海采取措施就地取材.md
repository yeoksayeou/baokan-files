Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 5th: Liaoning Province's education departments are running correspondence education with great efforts in the spirit of walking on two legs, training middle and primary school teachers, and have achieved remarkable results.

With the rapid development of education, in addition to training teachers in regular normal schools at all levels, the Liaoning Provincial Department of Education is also vigorously running correspondence education, so that the vast number of in-service teachers scattered throughout the province have the opportunity to study and improve their political and professional levels. Up to now, a correspondence education network with the Liaoning Correspondence Normal College and the Liaoyang Correspondence Normal Teaching and Research Department as the teaching business guidance center has been formed throughout the province. Most of the higher normal colleges and secondary and primary normal schools have established correspondence schools or correspondence departments (classes). Fifty correspondence colleges (departments, classes) have been established throughout the province, with more than 90,000 middle and primary school teachers participating in the study. This winter vacation, 210 teachers will graduate from advanced normal colleges with bachelor's degrees, and more than 5,000 people will graduate from junior and intermediate normal schools. After several years of study, they have mastered a considerable level of teaching knowledge.

Correspondence education can save a large number of teachers and teaching equipment, and facilitate in-service teachers in various places to combine study and work more closely. Therefore, correspondence education has achieved stable development in Liaoning Province. In order to effectively improve the quality of teaching, correspondence education organizations at all levels have also improved teaching methods according to actual conditions. Some schools have adopted methods such as vacation lectures and leading general students through backbone students, so that teachers can meet with students as directly as possible, so that teaching work has achieved good results. Many worker-peasant teachers who had a low level of education in the past have mastered systematic cultural and scientific knowledge through study; some teachers who graduated from junior or senior high school have continuously improved their teaching work level by participating in correspondence study. More than 50% of the teachers in the Anshan Worker-Peasant Cadre School have participated in correspondence schools at all levels, and some have graduated from the undergraduate program of the Higher Normal Correspondence Department and have become the backbone of teaching.

Due to the rapid development of correspondence education in Liaoning Province, in recent years, more than 2,000 teachers in the province have graduated from the correspondence departments of higher normal schools, and more than 15,000 teachers have graduated from the correspondence departments of secondary and primary normal schools.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, January 5th: Qinghai Province has actively taken measures to train literacy and worker-peasant spare-time school teachers, and has achieved great results.

In 1959, worker-peasant spare-time education in Qinghai Province has greatly developed. Up to now, more than 610,000 young people and adults in the province have participated in literacy and various types of spare-time school studies, of which the number of students in agricultural areas accounts for 87% of those who should be enrolled. The original teachers could not meet the needs in terms of quantity and quality. In order to ensure the further consolidation and development of literacy and spare-time education, the local party committees and education administrative departments have always attached importance to the issue of teacher training for spare-time education. In addition to mainly training teachers for spare-time secondary schools in the province, various localities also follow the principle of "educating the people by the people, those who are capable are teachers, using local materials, and self-reliance." On the one hand, they actively mobilized transferred soldiers, cadres sent to lower levels, and junior high school students returning to their hometowns to participate in production to serve as spare-time teachers. On the other hand, they vigorously carried out literacy and spare-time school teacher training through running spare-time normal schools, short-term rotational training, and the "apprenticeship" of middle and primary school teachers. Ledu County trained 510 spare-time teachers in a short period of time through rotational training. Huangzhong County has enabled each production team in the county to have one or more trained backbone teachers through the above methods.

In the process of carrying out spare-time education teacher training, all localities pay great attention to improving the ideological and professional level of spare-time teachers. Each commune party committee in the suburbs of Xining City has a secretary specifically responsible for spare-time education, and takes measures such as organizing learning regularly and conducting itinerant guidance to help spare-time teachers establish the idea of ​​loving education and familiarize themselves with teaching business. In addition to taking one to two afternoons a week to give spare-time teachers special preparation and learning, Hualong Hui Autonomous County also organizes activities such as listening to lectures and demonstration teaching, so that many new teachers can quickly improve their teaching ability. Spare-time school teachers in various communes in Datong County have also established teaching and research groups based on production teams or brigades to prepare lessons collectively, and study the problems existing in teaching at any time, and improve the teaching level through mutual assistance.

After these measures were taken, some areas have basically solved the problem of teachers for running worker-peasant spare-time education on a large scale. According to incomplete statistics, more than 8,000 spare-time teachers have been newly trained in Xining, Huangzhong, Ledu, Datong, Hualong and other cities and counties (autonomous counties). Most of these teachers can achieve clear concepts and highlight the key points when lecturing, thereby further improving the students' enthusiasm for learning.

    用两条腿走路大力培训师资
    辽宁大办函授教育　青海采取措施就地取材
    新华社沈阳5日电　辽宁省教育部门以两条腿走路的精神大办函授教育，培养训练中、小学教师，取得了显著成绩。
    随着教育事业的飞速发展，辽宁省教育厅，除了在各级正规师范学校里培养师资外，同时大办函授教育，使散在全省各地的广大在职教师，都有机会学习，提高政治、业务水平。到目前为止，在全省范围内已经形成了一个以辽宁函授师范学院和辽阳函授师范教学研究部为教学业务指导中心的业余函授教育网，绝大部分的高等师范院校和中、初级师范学校都建立了函授学校或函授部（班），全省成立起来的函授高等院校（部、班）达五十所，有九万多名中、小学教师参加学习。今年寒假，将有二百一十名教师自高级师范院、校本科毕业，有五千多人自初、中级师范学校毕业。他们经过几年的学习，已经掌握了相当水平的教学知识。
    函授教育可以节省大批教师和教学设备，便利于各地在职教师把学习和工作更紧密地结合起来，所以函授教育在辽宁省获得了稳固的发展。各级函授教育组织，为了有效地提高教学质量，也根据实际情况改进教学方法，有的学校曾采取了假期讲习，骨干学员带动一般学员等作法，使教师尽可能直接和学员见面，从而使教学工作获得了良好效果。许多过去文化水平不高的工农教师，经过学习已经掌握了系统的文化科学知识；有一些由初中或高中毕业的教师，由于参加函授学习，使教学工作水平不断提高。鞍山市工农干部学校有50％以上的教师参加了各级函授学校，有一部分已经由高等师范函授部本科毕业，成为教学上的骨干。
    辽宁省由于函授教育迅速发展，几年来，全省已有两千多名教师在高等师范学校的函授部毕业，有一万五千多名教师分别在中、初级师范学校函授部毕业。
    新华社西宁5日电　青海省积极采取措施培养训练扫盲和工农业余学校教师，取得了很大成绩。
    青海省1959年工农业余教育有很大发展，到目前为止，全省参加扫盲和各类业余学校学习的青年和壮年已达六十一万多人，其中农业区入学人数占应入学的87％。原有教师，在数量上和质量上都不能满足需要。为了保证扫盲和业余教育的进一步巩固和发展，各地党委和教育行政部门一直重视业余教育的师资培养问题，除由省里主要培养业余中等学校的师资以外，各地还根据“以民教民，能者为师，就地取材，自力更生”的原则，一面积极发动转业军人、下放干部、回乡参加生产的初中学生等担任业余教师，一面通过办业余师范、短期轮训和由中、小学教师“带徒弟”等办法，大力进行扫盲和业余学校的师资培养工作。乐都县通过轮训办法，在短期内就培养出五百一十名业余教师。湟中县通过以上办法，使全县每一个生产队都有了一名以上经过训练的骨干教师。
    在进行业余教育师资的培养工作中，各地都很注意提高业余教师思想水平和业务水平。西宁市郊区各公社党委都有一名书记专门负责业余教育工作，并采取定期组织学习、巡回辅导的办法，帮助业余教师树立热爱教育工作的思想，熟悉教学业务。化隆回族自治县除每周抽出一到二个下午给业余教师专门进行备课和学习外，还通过组织听课、示范教学等活动，使许多新教师迅速地提高了教学能力。大通县各公社的业余学校教师，也纷纷以生产队或大队为单位，成立教学研究组，集体进行备课，随时研究教学中存在的问题，通过互相帮助，提高了教学水平。
    采取了这些措施后，有些地区已经基本解决了大办工农业余教育的师资问题。据不完全统计，仅西宁、湟中、乐都、大通、化隆等市县（自治县）新培养的业余教师就有八千多名。这些教师，大部分人在讲课时能做到概念明确，重点突出，从而进一步提高了学员的学习积极性。
