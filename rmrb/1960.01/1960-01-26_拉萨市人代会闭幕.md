Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 25th - The first Lhasa Municipal People's Congress closed on the 24th. The first session of the Lhasa Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), held concurrently with the Municipal People's Congress, also closed on the same day.

Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet and Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, and Ngapoi Agvan Jigme, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibetan Autonomous Region, attended the meeting on the 24th and delivered speeches. They both congratulated the achievements of the two meetings.

After five days of full discussion, the delegates and members expressed satisfaction with the work of the counties and districts under the jurisdiction of Lhasa City in all aspects in 1959. They believe that under the leadership of the CPC Lhasa Municipal Committee and the Municipal Military Control Commission, the Lhasa area has rapidly restored and appropriately developed various production and construction undertakings in just nine months after the suppression of the rebellion. At present, the democratic reform work in agricultural areas has been basically completed, and the democratic reform in pastoral areas is also progressing smoothly. The social order in the entire Lhasa area is stable, and the people live and work in peace and contentment. These achievements, especially the liberation of productive forces, have laid an extremely favorable foundation for the continued development of political, economic, and cultural undertakings in the Lhasa area and for changing its backwardness.

The Municipal People's Congress unanimously adopted a resolution, warmly endorsing the work tasks of Lhasa City for 1960 proposed by the CPC Lhasa Municipal Committee, and decided to submit it to the Lhasa Municipal People's Government for implementation.

The meeting also unanimously adopted a telegram of salute to Chairman Mao.

The first session of the Lhasa Municipal Committee of the CPPCC also adopted a resolution on future work tasks. The Lhasa Municipal Committee of the CPPCC was formally established on the 18th, with He Zuyin elected as Chairman, and former Tibetan local government officials, retired Chief Kalon Ngawang Tuden Gunqing, Zhang Zhensheng, and Serchung Wangdu Renqin elected as Vice Chairmen.

All the representatives attending the Municipal People's Congress and the members attending the first session of the Lhasa Municipal Committee of the CPPCC also jointly wrote a letter of appreciation to the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, thanking the people's army under the leadership of the Communist Party of China for liberating the Tibetan people and turning the slaves of the old society into masters of the new society.

    拉萨市人代会闭幕
    新华社拉萨25日电　拉萨市首届人民代表会议已经在24日闭幕。与市人民代表会议同时举行的政协拉萨市委员会第一届第一次全体会议，也在同一天闭幕。
    中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武，西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美出席了24日的会议并讲了话。他们对这两个会议的成就都表示祝贺。
    经过五天的充分讨论，代表和委员们对于拉萨市所属各县、区1959年各方面的工作都表示满意。他们认为，在中共拉萨市委和市军事管制委员会领导下，拉萨地区在叛乱平息后仅仅九个月时间内，就迅速恢复并适当发展了各项生产建设事业。目前农业区的民主改革工作已经基本上完成，牧区的民主改革也正在顺利进行。全拉萨地区社会秩序安定，人民安居乐业。由于这些成就，特别是由于生产力的解放，已经为拉萨地区继续发展政治、经济和文化事业，改变落后面貌打下了极其有利的基础。
    市人民代表会议一致通过决议，热烈赞同中共拉萨市委提出的拉萨市1960年的工作任务，并且决定提交拉萨市人民政府贯彻执行。
    会议还一致通过了向毛主席致敬电。
    政协拉萨市委员会第一届第一次全体会议也通过了关于今后工作任务的决议。政协拉萨市委员会是在18日正式成立的，何祖荫当选为主席，前西藏地方政府卸任首席噶伦然巴·图丹滚清、张振生、色穷·旺堆仁钦当选为副主席。
    出席市人民代表会议的全体代表和出席政协拉萨市委员会第一届第一次全体会议的委员，还联名给人民解放军驻西藏部队写了一封慰问信，感谢在中国共产党领导下的人民军队使西藏人民翻了身，使旧社会的奴隶变成了新社会的主人。
