    Congratulations on the Birth of the "Honghe" Tractor
    The "Honghe" tractor, suitable for paddy field cultivation in the South, has been born at the Liuzhou Machinery Factory in Guangxi. This is a piece of good news for our country in accelerating the process of agricultural technological transformation.
    Our country has vast land, and the objects of cultivation include both large plains and mountains, as well as paddy fields and dry land. This requires the production of various agricultural machinery to meet the needs of different regions. The "Honghe" tractor is light in weight, small in size, and high in efficiency. It is dustproof, waterproof, leak-proof, flexible in operation, and easy to start. It is completely suitable for use in paddy field areas, hilly areas, and small plots of land in the South. The successful manufacture of this tractor has opened up a broad road for the mechanization of power in paddy field areas.
    It is a remarkable thing that the Liuzhou Machinery Factory was able to manufacture this tractor. This factory has never produced tractors, nor did it have specialized equipment for producing tractors. However, they managed to successfully trial-produce this complex product in just fifty-seven days and immediately put it into small-scale production.
    What experiences can be learned here?
    The most fundamental point is to actively create conditions and overcome difficulties. Any revolutionary work will encounter difficulties, large or small. The question is how to deal with difficulties. Is it to attack or retreat? Is it to create conditions to overcome difficulties, or to be constrained by existing conditions and stand still? Different attitudes towards difficulties and different methods adopted will yield different results. Under the leadership of the Party organization, the broad masses of workers in this factory launched an offensive against difficulties and bravely undertook the trial production task. Without equipment, they made it themselves; lacking materials, they relied on their own efforts to find solutions; not understanding the technology, they studied hard. In this way, difficulties were driven away, new conditions were created, and the "Honghe" tractor was born! Let us learn from the example of the Liuzhou Machinery Factory, muster our energy, overcome the difficulties in our progress, and do a better job in supporting the technological transformation of agriculture.

### 祝“红河”牌拖拉机诞生

    祝“红河”牌拖拉机诞生
    适合南方水田耕作条件的“红河”牌拖拉机在广西柳州机械厂诞生了。这是我国在加速农业技术改造进程中的一个喜讯。
    我国土地辽阔，耕作对象既有大平原和山区，又有水田和旱地。这就要求生产各种各样的农业机械以适应各类不同地区的需要。“红河”牌拖拉机重量轻、体积小、功效大，可以防尘、防水、防漏，运转灵活，起动方便，它完全适合南方水田地区、丘陵地带和小块田的使用。这种拖拉机制造成功，为水田地区动力机械化开辟了一条大道。
    柳州机械厂能够制出这种拖拉机，是一件了不起的事。这个厂没有生产过拖拉机，也没有生产拖拉机的专用设备。但是他们竟然只用五十七天就把这种复杂的产品试制成功了，并且立即投入了小批生产。
    这里有些什么经验可以吸取呢？
    最根本的一条就是积极创造条件，克服困难。任何一件革命工作都会遇到或大或小的困难，问题是如何对待困难。是进攻，还是撤退？是去创造条件克服困难，还是被现有的条件束缚住，裹足不前？对待困难的不同态度，和采取不同的方法，就会得到不同的效果。这个厂的广大职工，在党组织的领导下，向困难发起了攻势，勇敢地承担了试制任务。没有设备，自己动手制造；缺少材料，自力更生想法解决；不懂技术，刻苦钻研。就是这样，困难被赶跑了，新的条件创造出来了，“红河”牌拖拉机诞生了！让我们学习柳州机械厂的榜样，把干劲鼓足，克服前进中的困难，把支援农业技术改造的工作做得更加出色。
