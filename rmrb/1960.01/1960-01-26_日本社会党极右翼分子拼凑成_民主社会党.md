Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 24th: The extreme right-wing Nishio faction, which withdrew from the Japanese Socialist Party last October, gathered in Tokyo today and formally established a new party called the "Democratic Socialist Party."

This new party, with Suehiro Nishio as its chairman, issued a declaration of its founding, stating that it opposes communism and upholds parliamentary democracy. The declaration also touted the "gradual realization of socialism."

Its foreign policy stipulates that it "does not advocate the unilateral abolition" of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," but opposes changing this treaty "into a bilateral defense treaty." Regarding relations with the Soviet Union, the new party's foreign policy advocates concluding a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, but also unreasonably demands the "return" of the South and North Kuril Islands, Soviet territory, to Japan. Regarding relations with China, this party advocates restoring diplomatic relations with China, but it also creates "two Chinas," saying that "two governments in fact exist in China."

The Japanese Communist Party's "Akahata" newspaper pointed out: This new party is a "capitalist party."

Before the establishment of this new party, the Japanese bourgeois "Mainichi Shimbun" stated: The financial and business world believes that "the Nishio New Party is a good target for conservative parties." The newspaper revealed that "Nishio maintains close relations with many capitalists."

Goro Goto, the Secretary-General of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, said: "The financial and business world expresses full confidence in Nishio, who denies Marxism and affirms parliamentarism."

The party currently has thirty-eight members in the House of Representatives and sixteen in the Senate. Its Secretary-General is Masaru Tane, and its Senior Advisor is Tetsu Katayama.

    日本社会党极右翼分子
    拼凑成“民主社会党”
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：去年10月退出日本社会党的极右翼的西尾派今天在东京集会，正式成立了一个叫做“民主社会党”的新政党。
    这个由西尾末广担任委员长的新党发表建党宣言说，它反对共产主义，维护议会民主。宣言并且标榜要“渐进地实现社会主义”。
    它的外交方针规定，它“不主张单方面地废除”日美“安全条约”；但是反对把这项条约“改为双边性防御条约”。关于同苏联的关系，新党的外交方针主张同苏联缔结和约，但是又无理主张把苏联领土南北千岛“归还”日本；同中国的关系，这个政党主张同中国恢复邦交，但它又制造“两个中国”，说什么“中国事实上存在两个政府”。
    日本共产党“赤旗报”指出：这个新政党是一个“资本主义政党”。
    在这个新党成立以前，日本资产阶级的“每日新闻”就说：金融实业界认为，“西尾新党是保守政党的一个很好的对象”。这家报纸透露，“西尾同很多资本家保持着密切的关系”。
    日本经营者团体联盟事务局长后藤说：“金融实业界对于否定马克思主义而肯定议会主义的西尾，表示充分的信任”。
    这个政党目前在国会众议院有三十八名议员，在参议院有十六个议员。它的书记长是曾祢益、最高顾问是片山哲。
