Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th January. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" today published a commentary entitled "The Truth About the Lao Military Coup," pointing out that the Lao coup, engineered by extremely pro-American Lao warlordist elements, is part of a conspiracy by American imperialist warmongers to create coups in some Southeast Asian countries, and it has further worsened the situation in Laos.

The commentary said that the reactionary heads of the "Committee for the Defence of National Interests," the lackeys of American imperialism, have seized power in Laos after the coup. They are pushing for the establishment of a new government. All power in this government will naturally be concentrated in their hands, and all the policies and propositions of this government will be nothing more than the implementation of a fascist dictatorship, serving the aggressive policies of American imperialist warmongers.

After reviewing a series of measures taken by the warlord elements leading the "Committee for the Defence of National Interests" since seizing power, the commentary pointed out that these actions are clearly acts of military dictatorship. However, the spokesman for the Lao Royal Armed Forces General Headquarters disingenuously stated at a press conference in Vientiane on January 4 that "this is not a military dictatorship." This sophistry and the Lao Royal Armed Forces General Headquarters' claim that they have returned power to the King are all acts of deception. They are attempting to ease the opposition of various strata of the Lao people and some far-sighted politicians to the heads of the "Committee for the Defence of National Interests."

The commentary pointed out that the Lao people clearly know that the American imperialist warmongers and their lackeys—the warlord elements leading the "Committee for the Defence of National Interests"—are precisely the masterminds behind destroying the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, provoking the Lao civil war, launching a frenzied "suppression" campaign, and brutally murdering Lao patriotic and peace-loving people, detaining and advocating the assassination of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front. If these reactionary warlord elements are allowed to control the Lao regime, they will surely lead Laos onto an incomparably dark fascist road, and eventually Laos will become a colony and military base of American imperialism.

The commentary exposed the United States imperialism and some Western imperialist countries for covering up and distorting the facts, and refuted the US State Department spokesman's remarks at a press conference on January 4, which attempted to gloss over the Lao military's seizure of power. The commentary said that the United States is trying to ease public opinion so that its Lao lackeys can consolidate their position, further expand the civil war, and vigorously implement the American anti-communist policy in Laos.

The commentary pointed out that the policies of the warlord elements leading the "Committee for the Defence of National Interests" have always been: blatantly opposing the Geneva Agreements on Laos; provoking and expanding the Lao civil war; slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, continuously dispatching troops to provoke the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and violating the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; colluding with the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique and the reactionary groups of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization member states, attempting to turn Laos into an American war base, directly threatening the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the peace of Indochina. All of this cannot but make the Vietnamese people vigilant against their control of the Lao regime.

The commentary said that the Vietnamese people believe that the Lao people and the Lao progressive forces opposing the military dictatorship will eventually crush the conspiracy of the warlord elements leading the "Committee for the Defence of National Interests" and guide Laos onto the path of peace and neutrality, as hoped for by the Lao people.

    越南“人民报”发表评论指出
    老挝政变是美国好战分子的阴谋
    越南人民对老挝军阀掌握政权保持警惕
    新华社河内7日电　越南“人民报”今天以“老挝军事政变的真相”为题发表评论指出，极端亲美的老挝军阀主义分子制造的老挝政变是美帝国主义好战分子在东南亚某些国家制造政变的阴谋的一部分，它促使老挝的局势更加恶化。
    评论说，美帝国主义的走狗“保卫国家利益委员会”的反动头目们在政变后，已经掌握了老挝政权。他们正在促使成立新政府。这个政府的一切权力当然是集中在他们手里，这个政府的一切政策和主张不外是为了实行法西斯独裁制度，为美帝国主义好战分子的侵略政策效劳。
    评论在回顾了领导“保卫国家利益委员会”的军阀分子攫取政权以来的一系列措施之后指出，这些行为显然是军事独裁的行为。可是，老挝王国军队总司令部发言人1月4日在万象记者招待会上却诡辩说，“这不是军事独裁制度”。这种诡辩和老挝王国军队总司令部宣称他们已经把权柄交还国王的行为都是欺诈行为。他们企图借此来缓和老挝各阶层人民和一些有远见的政界人士对“保卫国家利益委员会”头目们的反对。
    评论指出，老挝人民清楚地知道，美帝国主义好战分子和他的走狗——领导“保卫国家利益委员会”的军阀分子正是破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议、挑起老挝内战、展开疯狂的“扫荡”和无比残暴地杀害老挝爱国、爱和平的人民、拘禁并主张杀害苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的元凶。如果让这些反动的军阀分子掌握老挝政权，他们一定会把老挝引上无比黑暗的法西斯道路，而最后老挝将会变成美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地。
    评论揭露美帝国主义和西方某些帝国主义国家掩盖和歪曲事实，驳斥美国国务院发言人在1月4日的记者招待会上掩饰老挝军队攫取政权的谈话。评论说，美国企图缓和舆论，好让它的老挝走狗便于巩固地位，进而扩大内战和在老挝大力实现美国的反共政策。
    评论指出，领导“保卫国家利益委员会”的军阀分子的政策一向是：明目张胆地反对关于老挝的日内瓦协议；挑起和扩大老挝内战；污蔑越南民主共和国，连续地出兵向越南民主共和国挑衅和侵犯越南民主共和国的领土；勾结吴庭艳卖国集团和东南亚条约组织各成员国的反动集团，企图把老挝变成美国的战争基地，直接威胁越南民主共和国的安全和印度支那的和平。这一切不能不使越南人民对他们掌握老挝政权提高警惕。
    评论说，越南人民相信，老挝人民和反对军事独裁制度的老挝进步力量最后一定会粉碎领导“保卫国家利益委员会”的军阀分子的阴谋，为老挝人民所希望的那样引导老挝走上和平中立的道路。
