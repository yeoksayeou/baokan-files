    A Resounding Answer
    Wen Chengxun, Worker at Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant

    A scoundrel stands before us.
    Roaring, jumping three feet high,
    Shouting filthy words,
    Releasing the poisonous fumes of the hydrogen bomb.
    "Poverty" and "dimness,"
    China will have a hard time getting through 1959.
    Wanting to build a family and start a business without relying on "American aid,"
    Is simply outrageous—audacious!
    We use a soaring red arrow,
    To expose your enormous lies.
    In 1958, ten thousand horses galloped,
    In 1959, the Five-Year Plan was completed in two years,
    Six hundred million people have six hundred million launchpads in their hearts,
    Look: endless multi-stage rockets are being launched!
    We are red to the core,
    Red in the bold celebratory characters on the good news reports.
    You are red to the core,
    Red in the red ink on your financial ledgers.
    We raise our fists and shout:
    "The Great Leap Forward of 1960!"
    You wipe the sweat from your noses,
    And cross yourselves on your chests:
    "Biased God,
    Don't listen to the Communist propaganda!"

    响亮的回答
    北京第一机床厂工人　温承训
    一个无赖汉站在我们面前。
    怒吼一声，暴跳三尺，
    喊出污浊的言语，
    放出氢弹的毒烟。
    “贫困”哪“暗淡”，
    中国难过1959这一关。
    想兴家立业又不靠“美援”，
    简直放肆——大胆！
    我们用一飞冲天的红箭头，
    揭穿你们天大的谎言。
    五八年，万马飞奔，
    五九年，五年计划两年完，
    六亿人心上六亿座发射台，
    请看：放不完的多级火箭！
    我们红到底，
    红在捷报上斗大的喜字。
    你们红到底，
    红在账本上财政的赤字。
    我们举拳高呼：
    “大跃进的1960年！”
    你们擦擦鼻尖上的汗，
    连划十字在胸前：
    “偏心的上帝啊，
    别听信共产党的宣传！”
