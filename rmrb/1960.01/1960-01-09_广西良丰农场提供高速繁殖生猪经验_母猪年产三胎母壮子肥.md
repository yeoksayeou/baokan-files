Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 8th: Guangxi State-owned Liangfeng Farm has successfully experimented with sows having multiple litters and multiple births, providing experience for developing pig farming at high speed.

In order to accelerate the breeding of commodity pigs, Liangfeng Farm selected nineteen sows with good conformation, good physique, good nutrition, and good production performance from one hundred and twenty-three sows for multi-litter and multi-birth experiments. The average gestation period of these nineteen sows was 107 to 110 days, and they were mated 13 to 14 days after giving birth. A total of 57 litters of piglets were produced within one year, which is exactly three litters per sow per year, with a total of 37 and a half piglets per litter. Although these sows produced three litters a year, they were still in good health. The survival rate of the piglets reached 93.3%, achieving the effect of strong mothers and fat piglets.

According to the experience of Liangfeng Farm, to achieve three litters per sow per year, first of all, the feed must be sufficient and the nutrition comprehensive, especially the supply of protein, vitamin, and mineral feeds must be adequate to enable the breeding pigs to have sufficient reproductive capacity. Boars weighing more than 300 jin should be fed 7 jin of concentrated feed and 6 to 7 jin of green feed per day. Sows should be fed mainly green and juicy feed, and the quantity and quality of the feed should be determined according to the gestation and lactation periods. Local sows weighing more than 200 jin should be given 2 to 3 jin of concentrated feed and 10 jin of green feed per day during gestation. During lactation, the concentrated feed should be increased to 3 and a half to 4 jin per day, and the green feed should be increased to 12 jin. During late pregnancy and lactation, additional protein and vitamin feeds such as malt and fish and shrimp should also be given. Boars and sows raised by this farm according to the above methods are physically strong and have strong reproductive power.

Secondly, it is necessary to promote early estrus in sows after delivery. In this regard, they have adopted three methods: First, the sow and piglets are separated five to seven days after the sow gives birth, and breastfeeding is controlled to three times a day. After the sow is in heat and mated, the sow and piglets are raised together again; second, on the second day after the sow gives birth, two-month-old male piglets are placed in the sow group (four or five hours a day) to promote estrus in the sow; third, starting on the second day after delivery, massage the sow's breasts two or three times a day. During the massage, apply light pressure and gentle massage from the front and back of the breast to the area around the vulva. This can promote more secretion of milk and early estrus. After adopting these three methods, all nineteen sows began to come into heat on the sixth day after delivery, and were mated on the thirteenth to fourteenth day.

In order to improve the conception rate and litter size, Liangfeng Farm adopted the method of multiple inseminations with mixed semen. Mixed semen is the mixing of semen collected from boars of different breeds. This farm used the semen of Berkshire, Yorkshire, and local boars, with the proportion of Berkshire and Yorkshire each accounting for 40%. The local breed accounts for 20%. Multiple inseminations are performed at three times, 30, 40, and 48 hours after the sow is in heat, with an insemination volume of 30 ml each time.

The farm has also strengthened the cultivation and management of piglets to improve the survival rate and litter weight of piglets. One or two days before the sow is about to give birth, the pigpen is cleaned and disinfected, and bedding and delivery equipment are prepared. When the sow is giving birth, there are midwives to take care of her, day and night. For the first three nights after delivery, there are breeders on duty to patrol and prevent piglets from being crushed and killed. When the piglets are five to seven days old, they begin to feed some peanut cakes, bone meal, clam shell powder, and staple feed, and soy milk is fed for five to ten days, and corn flour porridge is fed after ten days. At the same time, give the piglets appropriate exercise. In the third week of piglet production, the porridge feed is gradually increased. (Attached picture)

    广西良丰农场提供高速繁殖生猪经验
    母猪年产三胎母壮子肥
    新华社南宁8日电　广西国营良丰农场，试验母猪多胎多产成功，为高速度发展养猪提供了经验。
    良丰农场为了加速繁殖商品猪，从一百二十三头母猪中挑选出十九头体型好、体质好、营养好，生产性能好的母猪，进行多胎多产的试验。这十九头母猪的平均怀孕期为一百零七天到一百一十天，产后十三天至十四天就配了种，一年之内总共生产五十七窝小猪，正好每头母猪年产三窝，三窝共有小猪三十七头半。这些母猪虽然年产三窝，但身体仍然很好，小猪的成活率达到93．3％，两个月离乳后，平均重量十九点八斤，收到了母壮子肥的成效。
    根据良丰农场的经验，要做到母猪年产三窝，首先要饲料充足，营养全面，特别是蛋白质、维生素、矿物质的饲料要供应充足，使种猪有充分的繁殖能力。三百斤以上的公猪，要每天喂精饲料七斤、青饲料六至七斤。喂母猪以青绿多汁的饲料为主，按照怀孕期、哺乳期来确定饲料的数量和质量。二百斤以上的本地母猪，在怀孕期，每天给精饲料二、三斤，青饲料十斤，在哺乳期，精饲料每天增至三斤半到四斤，青饲料增至十二斤，在怀孕后期和哺乳期还另外加喂含蛋白质、维生素的饲料，如麦芽和鱼虾等。这个场按照上述方法饲养的公猪和母猪，体质健壮，生殖力旺盛。
    其次，是促进产后母猪早发情，在这方面，他们采取了三种办法：一、母猪分娩后五至七天，就把母猪和小猪隔离开，每天哺乳控制在三次，等到母猪发情配种后，再将母猪和小猪养在一起；二、母猪分娩后第二天便将两个月的小公猪放在母猪群中（每天四、五小时），促使母猪发情；三、产后第二天起，每天按摩母猪乳房二、三次，按摩时要轻压轻摩，从乳房的前部、后部直到阴部周围，这样可促其多分泌乳液，早发情。采用这三种办法后，十九头母猪都在分娩后第六天开始发情，十三到十四天就配上了种。
    为了提高受胎率和产子率，良丰农场采用了混合精液多次输精的办法。混合精液是将采自不同品种的公猪精液混合使用，这个场采用了盘克、约克和本地公猪的精液，其比例是盘克、约克各占40％。本地种占20％。多次输精是掌握在母猪发情后的第三十、四十、四十八小时三个时间，输精三次，每次输精量为三十毫升。
    这个农场还加强了小猪的培育管理，提高小猪的成活率和窝重。在母猪临产前一、二天，便做好猪栏的清扫、消毒工作，准备好垫草和接生用具。母猪生产时，不论白天、黑夜都有接生员护理。生产后的三个晚上，有饲养员守夜巡视，防止小猪被压伤压死。小猪生下五至七天时，开始喂一些花生饼、骨粉、蚌壳粉和主饲料，五至十天喂豆浆，十天以后改喂玉米粉粥。同时，给小猪适当运动。小猪生产第三周，喂给的粥料就逐渐增加了。（附图片）
