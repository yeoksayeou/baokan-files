Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 5th: TASS reported from Moscow on January 4th: The Soviet Union's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, wrote to the United Nations Secretary-General, Hammarskjöld, on December 30th of last year, requesting him to consider taking measures to stop the South African Union authorities' large-scale expulsion of Black people in the Southwest Africa Trust Territory.

The letter pointed out that the actions of the South African Union authorities have caused serious conflicts and casualties and should be resolutely condemned, as these actions violate the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The South African Union authorities used troops to suppress Black residents protesting against forced expulsion in Windhoek, the capital of Southwest Africa. As a result, dozens of Black people were injured or killed.

The letter stated: On December 15, 1959, a local Southwest African resident, Klinas, representing the local residents, submitted a petition to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev. Klinas said that the situation was critical and that even more serious bloodshed would occur if immediate measures were not taken.
