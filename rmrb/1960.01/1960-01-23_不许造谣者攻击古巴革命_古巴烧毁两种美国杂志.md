Xinhua News Agency, Havana, January 21st: On the 20th, Cuban masses angrily burned the American "Life" magazine and "Reader's Digest" magazine, which insulted Cuba, on a street in Havana. Havana vendors have stopped selling "Life" magazine.

In their latest issues, these two American magazines published articles attacking the Cuban revolution, which aroused great indignation among the Cuban people. "Reader's Digest" distorted the facts and falsely claimed that Cuba had experienced economic difficulties and popular disappointment after a year of land reform. This magazine also described the Cuban government's actions to eliminate traitors as "communist infiltration into the Cuban government."

Currently, American newspapers, in coordination with reactionary newspapers in Cuba, are intensifying their anti-Cuban propaganda campaign. The day before yesterday, the American "New York Times" published an open letter, inciting interference in Cuba under the guise of anti-communism. It clamored that the United States cannot allow the establishment of a "people's democratic country" led by communists ninety-eight nautical miles from the American coast. The letter also shamelessly suggested that the United States launch a "diplomatic offensive" against Cuba, attempting to turn Cuba into a second Puerto Rico. Today, Cuba's "Hoy," "Revolución," and other newspapers published commentaries, strongly condemning the anti-Cuban movement in the American press.

    不许造谣者攻击古巴革命
    古巴烧毁两种美国杂志
    据新华社哈瓦那21日电　古巴群众20日在哈瓦那的一条大街上，愤怒地烧毁了侮辱古巴的美国“生活”杂志和“文摘”杂志。哈瓦那商贩已停止出售“生活”杂志。
    这两家美国杂志在最近一期中发表了攻击古巴革命的文章，引起古巴人民极大的愤慨。“文摘”杂志颠倒黑白，造谣说，古巴在土地改革进行一年以后引起了经济困难，人民又失望了。这家杂志还把古巴政府肃清叛徒的行动说成是“共产党渗入了古巴政府”。
    目前，美国报刊在古巴国内反动报纸的配合下，正在加紧进行反古巴的宣传运动。前天，美国的“纽约时报”发表了一封公开信，煽动以反共为幌子来干涉古巴。叫嚷说美国不能允许在离美国海岸九十八浬的地方建立一个由共产党人领导的“人民民主国家”。这封信还无耻地建议美国对古巴发动“外交攻势”，企图把古巴变成第二个波多黎各。今天，古巴“今日报”、“革命报”和其他报纸都发表评论，痛斥美国报界的反古巴运动。
