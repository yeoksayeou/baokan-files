Xinhua News Agency, Hefei News: Qianshan County, Anhui Province, while constructing water conservancy projects, attaches great importance to water storage work. The small-scale water conservancy projects that have been completed throughout the county have been checked and accepted, and have stored 100 million cubic meters of water. According to statistics, this amount of water can not only guarantee the water needed for rice transplanting in the county's 360,000 mu of paddy fields, but also provide water for two irrigations after transplanting.

This county emphasized both repair and storage when it began building water conservancy projects last winter. It realized that one place should be repaired, one place should be accepted, one place should store water, and one place should be well managed, to ensure that the benefits of water conservancy projects are fully utilized. When the Jin Chong Reservoir in Chashui Commune was basically completed, it selected more than 100 commune members to form a professional reservoir maintenance team and began storing water. Now the reservoir has stored more than 950,000 cubic meters of water, which is enough for the water needs of more than 3,000 mu of rice fields below the reservoir.

In the water storage work in various places, ideological education was generally carried out for commune members. The Sanmiao Commune Party Committee used the example of the late water storage in the spring of 1959, when twenty small reservoirs were not filled with water, which caused some late rice to suffer from drought, to educate cadres and commune members. Now, all the original and newly built thirty-two reservoirs and three hundred and twenty ponds in the commune are full of water.

   修蓄并举　保证灌溉
    新华社合肥讯  安徽省潜山县在兴修水利的同时，十分重视蓄水工作。全县已完成的小型水利工程，经过检查验收以后，已蓄水一亿立方米。据统计，这一水量除能保证全县三十六万亩水田的插秧用水外，还可以供插秧后两次灌溉用。
    这个县在去冬开始兴修水利时，就强调修蓄并举。实现了修好一处，验收一处，蓄水一处，管好一处，以保证充分发挥水利工程的效益。槎水公社在金冲水库基本竣工时，就选派了一百多名社员组成水库保养专业队，开始蓄水。现在这个水库已蓄水九十五万多公方，足够库下三千多亩水稻田的用水需要。
    各地抓蓄水工作中，普遍对社员进行了思想教育。三妙公社党委用1959年春季蓄水抓得迟，二十个小型水库未灌满水，以致造成部分晚稻受旱的事例对干部、社员进行了教育。现在，公社原有和新造的三十二个水库，三百二十塘，全部蓄满了水。
