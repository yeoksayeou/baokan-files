    Steel Ballads
        Small Western-style Furnaces
    Small Western-style furnaces, not simple,
    Covering the sky and earth with great power:
    Open their mouths and spit out the four seas,
    Close their mouths and swallow ten thousand mountains.
        Happy Phoenix Flies to the Slope
    An old man lives at Phoenix Slope,
    Since ancient times, the phoenix has never landed there;
    Since the steel factory was built,
    The happy phoenix flies to the slope!
        Rainbow Falls in the Blue Sky
    Holding a steel drill and playing with the fire dragon,
    A whistle sounds and the mud is opened;
    The red flow pours down three thousand feet,
    A rainbow falls in the blue sky!
        Many Heroes on the Steel Front
    Pomegranate flowers bloom red like fire,
    Many heroes on the steel front;
    The heroes' songs are not yet finished,
    Smelting steel fills the mountains and rivers!

    钢铁歌谣
        小洋群
    小洋群，不简单，
    遮天盖地好威严：
    张口吐出四海水，
    闭口吞下万座山。
        喜得凤凰飞上坡
    老汉家住凤凰坡，
    自古凤凰未落过；
    自从建起钢铁厂，
    喜得凤凰飞上坡！
        万里蓝天落彩虹
    手里钢钎戏火龙，
    一声哨响启泥封；
    红流飞泻三千丈，
    万里蓝天落彩虹！
        钢铁战线英雄多
    石榴花开红似火，
    钢铁战线英雄多；
    英雄歌儿未唱完，
    炼出钢水满山河！
