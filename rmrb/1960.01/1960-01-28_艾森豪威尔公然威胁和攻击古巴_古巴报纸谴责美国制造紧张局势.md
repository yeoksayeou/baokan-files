Xinhua News Agency, Havana, January 27th: Cuban newspapers have severely condemned the statement made by Eisenhower at a press conference in Washington on the 26th, which threatened and attacked the Cuban government.

At the press conference, Eisenhower stated that the "differences" between the United States and Cuba should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations. However, if no agreement is reached, the United States intends to resolve them through appropriate international procedures.

"Combate" (Combat) newspaper stated in an editorial today that Eisenhower's statement is nothing more than using the Organization of American States, an organization manipulated by the US State Department, to interfere in Cuba. The newspaper pointed out that the United States will never openly admit to carrying out armed aggression against Cuba. American military strategists will also buy some time, talking about resolving the issue through diplomatic channels, but at the same time, the United States is imposing an economic blockade on Cuba.

Combate emphasized that when the United States is confident that its coordination with counter-revolutionary elements within Cuba is very complete, then they will believe that the time has come and will ask the Organization of American States to intervene through an international police force controlled by the United States.

Combate pointed out that the United States is using its usual "accusations" of communism and "accusations" that the compensation for land expropriated in Cuba's land reform is unreasonable as a smokescreen to cover up its true interference in Cuba.

In another commentary, Combate pointed out that the United States is formulating a plan to invade Cuba, attempting to turn Cuba's Isle of Pines into Cuba's Taiwan, from which to attack the capital, Havana.

"Hoy" (Today) newspaper published an editorial on the front page stating that Eisenhower's statement and other US activities interfering in Cuba can only show that US imperialism is in a state of desperation, attempting to eliminate the Cuban revolution as soon as possible in its desperation, so that its running dogs can regain power and restore the semi-colonial regime that was overthrown by the Cuban revolution.

Hoy pointed out that the purpose of the imperialist conspiracy is to deceive Castro, organize a rebellion within the revolutionary camp, and force the Cuban revolutionaries and the Cuban people to submit through blackmail, threats, provocations, and divisive activities, but these conspiracies have failed. Contrary to the wishes of the imperialists, the Cuban revolution has advanced and consolidated. Therefore, their offensive has developed to a new stage.

Hoy emphasized that the United States has carried out unparalleled threats against Cuba, creating a tense war situation.

Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: US President Eisenhower, at a press conference held on the 26th, focused on the issue of relations between the United States and Cuba. He expressed "deep concern and great unease" about the increasingly deteriorating relations between the United States and Cuba in recent months. He also reversed black and white, trying to attribute the responsibility for the deterioration of relations between the two countries, caused by the United States condoning Batista criminals who fled to the United States to carry out subversive activities against Cuba and by the United States repeatedly interfering in Cuba's land reform, to Cuba. Eisenhower described Cuban Prime Minister Castro's legitimate protests against the above-mentioned US interference activities as "unfounded" and "unreasonable attacks," and threatened that Castro's remarks "make it difficult to promote" "understanding and appropriate relations" between the two governments.

In the five key points of his proposed policy toward Cuba, while hypocritically expressing no intention of interfering in Cuba's internal affairs and acknowledging Cuba's "right to exercise national sovereignty in carrying out desirable social, economic, and political reforms," he also clamored that "the United States will continue to defend its own sovereignty and legitimate rights," attempting to create excuses for continuing to interfere in Cuba's land reform and to maintain the illegal interests of US monopoly capital. He also said in a threatening tone that the United States believes that the "differences" between it and Cuba will be resolved through diplomatic negotiations; and if no agreement is reached, the United States "intends to resolve [them] through other appropriate international procedures," that is to say, the United States will use tools such as the Organization of American States to interfere in Cuba.

Eisenhower's remarks at the press conference also greatly distorted the national independence movement in Latin America. He once again repeated the imperialist anti-communist cliché, attributing the anti-American sentiment of the Cuban people, which was caused by US interference, to some kind of "international communist conspiracy."

### 艾森豪威尔公然威胁和攻击古巴  古巴报纸谴责美国制造紧张局势

    艾森豪威尔公然威胁和攻击古巴
    古巴报纸谴责美国制造紧张局势
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　古巴报纸严厉谴责艾森豪威尔26日在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上所发表的威胁和攻击古巴政府的声明。
    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上表示，美国同古巴的“分歧”应该通过外交谈判解决，但是，如果达不成协议，美国打算通过适当的国际程序来解决。
    “战斗报”今天发表的社论说，艾森豪威尔的声明不外是利用受美国国务院操纵的机构——美洲国家组织来干涉古巴。报纸指出，美国任何时刻都不会公开承认要对古巴进行武装侵略。美国的军事战略家还会争取一些时间，谈论通过外交途径解决问题，可是与此同时，美国却对古巴进行经济封锁。
    战斗报强调指出，当美国确信它同古巴国内的反革命分子的配合已经非常完满的时候，那时他们就会认为时机已到，并将要求美洲国家组织通过美国所控制的国际警察部队来进行干涉。
    “战斗报”指出，美国正在利用它惯用的对共产主义的“控告”和对古巴在土地改革中征用土地所作的赔偿不合理的“控告”，作为掩盖它对古巴进行真正干涉的幕布。
    “战斗报”在另一篇评论中指出，美国正在制定侵略古巴的计划，它企图把古巴的皮诺斯岛变成古巴的台湾，从那里向首都哈瓦那进攻。
    “今日报”在第一版发表社论指出，艾森豪威尔的声明和美国干涉古巴的其他活动只能说明，美帝国主义已经处于绝望，它在绝望中企图尽早消灭古巴革命，使它的走狗重新上台，从而恢复被古巴革命推翻了的半殖民地政权。
    “今日报”指出，帝国主义阴谋的目的是迷惑卡斯特罗，在革命阵营内组织叛变，并且通过讹诈、威胁、挑衅和分裂活动使古巴革命者和古巴人民屈服，可是这些阴谋都破产了。与帝国主义者的愿望相反，古巴革命前进了和巩固了。因此，他们的进攻发展到了新阶段。
    “今日报”强调指出，美国对古巴进行了无以复加的威胁，制造了战争紧张局势。
    新华社27日讯　美国总统艾森豪威尔在26日举行的记者招待会上着重谈到美国和古巴的关系问题。他对最近几个月来美国同古巴关系的日益恶化表示“深为关切和非常不安”，并且颠倒黑白，力图把由于美国纵容逃到美国去的巴蒂斯塔罪犯进行反对古巴的颠复活动和由于美国一再干涉古巴土地改革所造成的两国关系恶化的责任推在古巴身上。艾森豪威尔把古巴总理卡斯特罗对美国的上述干涉活动所表示的正当抗议说成是“没有根据的”和“毫无理由的攻击”，并且威胁说，卡斯特罗的言论“很难促进”两国政府之间的“谅解和适宜的关系”。
    艾森豪威尔在他提出的对古巴政策的五个要点中，虽然一方面虚伪地表示无意干涉古巴内政，并且承认古巴有进行所谓“可取的社会、经济和政治改革方面行使国家主权的权利”，但是另一方面，却叫嚷“美国将继续保卫自己的主权和合法权益”，妄图为继续干涉古巴的土地改革和维护美国垄断资本非法利益制造借口。他并且以威胁的口吻说，美国认为它同古巴之间的“分歧”将通过外交谈判来解决；而如果达不成协议，美国“打算通过其他适当的国际程序来解决”，这就是说，美国将利用美洲国家组织这类的工具来干涉古巴。
    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上的谈话还极力歪曲拉丁美洲的民族独立运动。他又一次重弹帝国主义的反共滥调，把由于美国干涉而引起的古巴人民的反美情绪说成是什么“国际共产主义的阴谋”。
