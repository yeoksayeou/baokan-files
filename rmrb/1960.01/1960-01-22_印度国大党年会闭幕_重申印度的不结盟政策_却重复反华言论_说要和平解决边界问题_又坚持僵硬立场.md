Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 21st: The 65th annual meeting of India's ruling Congress Party concluded in Bangalore on the evening of January 17th, passing three resolutions on international affairs, Indian borders, and economic development. In these resolutions, the annual meeting reaffirmed India's non-aligned policy, while also repeating the unfounded anti-China rhetoric that "Chinese troops have occupied several parts of Indian territory" and that "aggression has occurred." Under this rhetoric, it emphasized the "unity" of the Indian people in the face of China's "challenge" and the need to accelerate India's economic development.

The resolution on the border issue stated that "all steps should be taken to resolve the issue by peaceful means," but insisted on the rigid stance adopted by the Indian government on the Sino-Indian border issue.

The Bangalore annual meeting lasted six days, beginning with a meeting of the Congress Working Committee to draft the three draft resolutions. This was followed by a meeting of the Subjects Committee to discuss these draft resolutions, and finally, on the 17th, a plenary session of the National Committee was held, at which the resolutions were unanimously passed. Indian Prime Minister Nehru made several speeches at the meeting.

During the Subjects Committee's discussion of the resolution on international affairs on the 15th, some Congress members spoke fiercely against India's non-aligned policy, advocating for "military alliances with friendly countries." They were refuted by Nehru and other Congress members. Nehru said that they wanted to make India abandon its "most valuable asset," which gave India "honor and prestige in world conferences." Former Congress President Indira Gandhi, when presenting the proposal at the plenary session, said that if this non-aligned policy were changed, the Congress Party would not be supported by the Indian masses.

During the discussion of the resolution on the border issue, some people requested that the draft resolution be amended, asking Nehru to take "firm action," and even proposed "establishing a cooperative defense system of Asian countries to deal with China." In his speech, Nehru said that he believed there would be no war over the border issue. He said at the Subjects Committee on the 16th that India and China were both large countries, and that "when they clash with each other, the consequences would probably be far-reaching for both sides." He also said that India cannot and should not use threatening language against other countries, including China. But he also said that the Sino-Indian border issue was an "extremely serious matter" and "not something that will subside quickly," so India must do everything possible to prepare. He said he hoped that the "inescapable feeling of the public" would lead to strengthening the country, and that this strength could only come from economic development.

The resolution on economic development emphasized the need to rapidly develop the economy, stating that "the challenges and difficulties occurring on India's northern and northeastern borders make it even more necessary to strengthen and concentrate efforts on economic development." According to Subramanian and some other Congress members, this "challenge" is mainly a "economic and ideological challenge." The resolution also emphasized that the Indian people should maintain "discipline" and "unity" and oppose "factionalism and divisive tendencies."

The resolution stated that "the size of the Third Five-Year Plan should ensure that the country can reach the stage of transitioning to a self-reliant economy. This growth requires rapid development of industry and agriculture." When discussing the development of agricultural production, the resolution emphasized good farming techniques and the modernization of agricultural methods, such as the use of modern irrigation equipment, improved farm implements, and the use of superior seeds. The resolution reiterated the resolution on agricultural organization adopted at the Congress Party's Nagpur annual meeting last year (which mentioned the implementation of cooperative farming, the establishment of service cooperatives, and the issue of maximum land ceilings in rural areas), but no longer emphasized the issue of maximum land ceilings.

The resolution emphasized the development of heavy industry, especially the steel, machine-building, and power industries, but the question of whether to prioritize the development of the public sector or the private sector was not mentioned.

Almost all the speakers at the meeting attacked the Communist Party of India. Some attacked it as a so-called "fifth column," and some even demanded that the Communist Party of India be forbidden from continuing its so-called "treasonous activities."

### 印度国大党年会闭幕  重申印度的不结盟政策　却重复反华言论  说要和平解决边界问题　又坚持僵硬立场

    印度国大党年会闭幕
    重申印度的不结盟政策　却重复反华言论
    说要和平解决边界问题　又坚持僵硬立场
    新华社新德里21日电　印度执政党国大党第六十五次年会17日晚在班加罗尔闭幕，会上通过了关于国际事务、印度边界和经济发展的三个决议。年会在这些决议中重申了印度的不结盟政策，同时又重复毫无根据的“中国军队占领了印度的几部分领土”、“发生了侵略”等反华言论，并且在这种论调下强调印度全国人民“团结一致”，对付中国的“挑战”，加快印度的经济发展速度。
    关于边界的决议说，“应当采取一切步骤通过和平方法解决问题”，但是又坚持印度政府在中印边界问题所采取的僵硬的立场。
    班加罗尔年会历时共六天，开始是国大党工作委员会开会，起草三项决议草案。接着举行议题委员会会议，就这些决议草案进行讨论，最后在17日举行全国委员会全体会议，一致通过了这些决议。印度总理尼赫鲁在会上作了多次发言。
    在议题委员会15日讨论关于国际事务的决议时，有一些国大党人发言激烈地攻击印度的不结盟政策，主张“同友好国家缔结军事联盟”。他们遭到尼赫鲁和另一些国大党人的驳斥。尼赫鲁说，他们想使印度抛弃它的“最宝贵的财产”，这种财产使印度“在世界会议上享有荣誉和威信”。前国大党主席英迪拉·甘地夫人在全体会议上提出这个提案时说，如果改变这种不结盟政策，国大党将得不到印度人民群众的支持。
    在讨论关于边界问题的决议时，有人要求修改决议草案，要求尼赫鲁采取“坚定的行动”，甚至提出“建立亚洲国家的合作防御体系来对付中国”。尼赫鲁在发言中说，他相信在边界问题上不会发生战争。他在16日议题委员会上说，印度和中国都是大国，它们“互相发生冲突的时候，其后果大概对双方都有深远意义”。他还说，印度不能、也不应当对其他国家、包括中国使用威胁性的语言。但是他又说，中印边境问题是“极其严重的事情”，“不是很快就会平息的事情”，因此印度必须尽一切可能进行准备。他说，他希望“公众的不可忽视的感情”将导致使国家增强力量，而这种力量只可能来自经济发展。
    关于经济发展的决议强调迅速发展经济的必要性，它说，“在印度北部和东北部边界发生的挑战和困难，更加使得有必要加强和集中力量进行经济发展。”据苏布拉曼尼安和另外一些国大党人说，这种“挑战”主要是“经济和意识形态方面的挑战”。决议还强调要印度人民守“纪律”和“团结一致”，反对“派别和分裂倾向”。
    决议说，“第三个五年计划的规模应该保证使国家能够达到转向自力更生的经济的阶段。这种增长需要迅速发展工业和农业。”决议谈到发展农业生产时，强调了良好的耕作技术和使农业方法现代化。如利用现代灌溉设备、改进农具、利用优良种子等。决议重申去年国大党那格浦尔年会上关于农业组织形式问题的决议（其中谈到在农村中实行合作耕种、办服务合作社和最高土地限额等问题），但是没有再强调土地最高限额问题。
    决议强调发展重工业，尤其是钢铁、机器制造和电力工业，但是优先发展公营部分还是优先发展私营部分的问题没有谈到。
    会上几乎所有的发言者都攻击印度共产党。有人攻击它是所谓“第五纵队”，有人甚至要求不准印度共产党继续进行所谓“卖国活动”。
