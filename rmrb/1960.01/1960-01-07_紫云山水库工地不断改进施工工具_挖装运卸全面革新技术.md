    Ziyunshan Reservoir Construction Site Continuously Improves Construction Tools
    Comprehensive Technological Revolution in Excavation, Loading, Transportation and Unloading
    (Our newspaper's report from Nanchang on the 6th) The Ziyunshan Reservoir in Fengcheng County, Jiangxi Province, after achieving tremendous success in high construction efficiency, has further strengthened its leadership, resulting in new developments in various technological innovations. Construction machinery and equipment have increased fourfold, soil transport efficiency has more than doubled, and a large amount of engineering materials have been saved.
    In the past month, more than 2,000 representatives from over 20 provinces and regions across the country have visited the Ziyunshan Reservoir, giving the reservoir's employees enthusiastic praise during their visits.
    Mobilizing the masses to innovate tools, create new machinery, and implement joint operations of various soil transport machinery is a characteristic of the new development of tool technology innovation at the Ziyunshan Water Conservancy Project.
    In the past month, the Ziyunshan Reservoir has increased the number of newly manufactured large-scale soil transport machines from the previous five to nineteen, including high dam soil transport winches, which have increased from one to ten, and have also undergone many important improvements. In the initial stage of these winches, they were all made of wooden wheels and wooden axles, resulting in a high failure rate. Later, they were transformed into iron wheels and iron axles, and the speed of the belt pulley was increased to further enhance power efficiency. This increased the number of soil buckets on the winch from 240 to 360, the load capacity of the soil buckets from 15 jin to 30 jin, and the length from more than 60 meters to 110 meters. Although the number, size, and length of the soil buckets carried by the winch have increased several times, the speed of the soil buckets' rotation has increased from the original one to seven minutes to one to three minutes by changing the small belt pulley to a large belt pulley accordingly. The daily soil transport efficiency has increased from the original 240 cubic meters to 1,140 cubic meters. With the soil transport efficiency of the winch increasing several times, the total length of various soil transport machinery on the reservoir construction site has reached more than 2,300 meters, which requires a large supply of labor for soil materials. At this time, the reservoir laborers created a foot-operated soil transport winch, which can transport soil down from the mountain without a power machine, and automatically load it into the winch soil buckets, which are then lifted to the high dam by the winch. This saves a large number of laborers for intermediate transportation and loading and unloading of soil. The long-distance soil transport double-rail train also serves the high dam soil transport winch, but these two types of soil transport machines were not well connected in the past, so the soil was transported by train and then manually transferred to the winch soil yard, and then loaded into the winch after another procedure. Now, by installing a soil discharge hopper at the connection of these two soil transport machines, the intermediate transfer process is reduced, and the entire construction site saves more than 2,300 workdays every day, greatly improving soil transport efficiency.
    In order to solve the problem of large amounts of soil needed for dam closure and mechanical soil transport, the Ziyunshan Reservoir has also comprehensively promoted the blasting of soil extraction and canal digging, replacing manual soil digging with gunpowder blasting to loosen the soil, ensuring the timely supply of 20,000 cubic meters of soil needed for the closure of the earth dam.
    In this way, the Ziyunshan Reservoir has developed from tool reforms in individual processes to comprehensive technological innovation.
    The inlet and outlet control equipment that has been successfully built and included in the national water conservancy technology experience exchange projects is another major innovation of this reservoir after the tool reform. This technological innovation overcomes the difficulties of insufficient equipment and ensures that the reservoir can be completed on schedule. According to the original design of this reservoir, an intake tower 25 meters high and a work bridge connecting the dam's traffic were to be built in front of or in the middle of the dam. However, the 102-meter-long round steel required for the control equipment could not be met. The leaders of the construction site Party committee, together with engineering and technical personnel, after painstaking research, finally found a good and economical solution. This is to change the dam-front control equipment to dam-rear control equipment. Practice has proved that this approach not only has the same effect, but also solves the difficulties of mutual interference during construction, which affects the progress of the project. Due to the creative change of the design, the intake tower project was omitted, saving 102 meters of large round steel, 13 tons of steel bars, 68 tons of cement, more than 2 tons of iron parts, and a large amount of wood. In addition, according to the original design, four spare gates need to be installed at the reservoir's inlet. Due to the lack of steel and iron parts, the engineering and technical personnel, with the strong support of the construction site Party committee, successfully designed reinforced concrete cylindrical gates, which saved the project more than 30,000 yuan.
    In the continuous series of innovations at the Ziyunshan Reservoir, the Party committee adhered to the principle of putting politics in command, and educated employees to continue to move forward with the spirit of continuous revolution, timely overcoming the ideas of some employees such as "innovation has reached its peak," and pushing technological innovation to a new stage.

    紫云山水库工地不断改进施工工具
    挖装运卸全面革新技术
    本报南昌6日电　江西丰城县紫云山水库在取得施工高工效的巨大成绩后，进一步加强领导，使各项技术革新有了新的发展，施工机械设备增加了四倍，运土工效又提高了一倍以上，工程器材得到大量节约。
    最近一个月来，全国二十多个省区的二千多个代表，参观了紫云山水库，代表们在参观中给予这个水库职工以热烈的赞扬。
    发动群众革新工具，创造新的机械，多种运土机械实行联合作业，这是紫云山水利工具技术革新新发展的一个特点。
    紫云山水库一个多月来，新制大型的运土机械已由过去的五部增加到十九部，其中高坝运土卷扬机由一部发展到十部，并且又进行了许多重要的改进。这种卷扬机初制时期都是木轮木轴，因而损坏率很高，后来改造成铁轮铁轴，并加大皮带盘的转速，进一步发挥了动力效能，使卷扬机上的运土斗由二百四十个增加到三百六十个，土斗载重由十五斤增加到三十斤，长度由六十多米增加至一百一十米。卷扬机所带的土斗虽成倍地加多、加大、加长，但由于相应地改小皮带轮为大皮带轮，土斗运转一周的速度也由原来一至七分钟提高为一至三分钟；每天运土工效由原来的二百四十方增加到一千一百四十方。随着卷扬机运土工效成倍提高，水库工地上的各种运土机械总长度发展到二千三百多米，因而就需要有大量的劳动力供应土料。这时水库民工又创造了一种脚踏运土卷扬机，不要动力机带动，就能把山上的土运下来，并自动地装进卷扬机土斗，再由卷扬机提上高坝。这样就节省了大批中途转运和装卸土的劳动力。远距离运土双轨列车也是为高坝运土卷扬机服务的，但这两种运土机过去并没有很好地衔接起来，至使列车把土运来，又要用人工转运到卷扬机上土场，再经一次手续装进卷扬机。现在，在这两种运土机的衔接处安装上一个下土漏斗，就减少了中转工序，全工地每天因此节省了二千三百多个工作日，运土工效得到大大的提高。
    紫云山水库为解决大坝合拢和机械运土所需大量土源，又全面推行了取土、挖渠爆破化，以火药爆破松土代替人力挖土，保证了土坝合拢所需要的二万方土的及时供应。
    就是这样，紫云山水库已由个别工序的工具改革发展到全面的技术革新。
    已经建筑成功并列入全国水利技术经验交流项目的进出水口控制设备，是这个水库继工具改革后的又一重大创举。这项技术革新克服了器材不足的困难，保证水库能按期完工。这座水库按照原设计，要在坝前或坝中建一座高二十五米的进水塔和沟通大坝交通的工作桥。但控制设备所需的长一百零二米的圆钢得不到满足。工地党委领导工程技术人员经过苦心钻研，终于找出了一项又好又省的办法。这就是改坝前式控制设备为坝后式控制设备。实践证明，这种做法不仅作用相同，而且还解决了施工中互相干扰，影响工程进度的困难。由于创造性地改变了设计，就节略了进水塔工程，从而节省了一百零二米的大型圆钢、十三吨钢筋、六十八吨水泥、二吨多铁件和大量木料。此外，水库进水口按照原设计，还需要安装四道预备闸门。由于钢材铁件缺乏，工程技术人员就在工地党委大力支持下，成功地设计了钢筋混凝土的圆筒闸门，从而又使工程节省了三万多元。
    紫云山水库在继续进行这一连串的不断革新中，党委坚持了政治挂帅，以不断革命的精神教育职工继续前进，及时地克服了部分职工“革新到顶”等思想，把技术革新推向了一个新的阶段。
