    Rescue the Innocent Victims of South Vietnam
    A Commentator of This Newspaper
    On December 19th of last year, the South Vietnamese Special Military Court, under the fabricated charges of "murdering American advisors" and "rebellion," sentenced former resistance members Wu Guangqing, Wu Wenkong, and four others to death and long-term imprisonment in Bien Hoa province. This is yet another ironclad proof of the South Vietnamese authorities' blatant violation of the Geneva Accords; it is also one of the most despicable cases in the South Vietnamese authorities' cruel slaughter and suppression of former resistance members.
    Wu Guangqing and others were all members of the Resistance Administrative Committee and members of the National Salvation Association during the Vietnamese War of Resistance. After the restoration of peace, they all lived normal lives at home. According to Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords, which stipulates that there should be no retaliation or discrimination against former resistance members, their lives and safety should have been guaranteed. Wu Guangqing and others had absolutely nothing to do with the attack on American military advisors that occurred in Bien Hoa Province on July 8, 1959. Some of them, such as Wu Wenkong, were even arrested in 1955. However, after failing to find any evidence to frame them for "murder," the South Vietnamese Special Military Court invoked the "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959" and sentenced them for "rebellion"!
    The Ngo Dinh Diem clique's "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959" is a completely fascist ordinance. Like the "Policy on Former Resistance Members" announced by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique from August 25 to September 2, 1959, it is a tool for the South Vietnamese authorities to further violate the Geneva Accords and carry out large-scale bloody persecution of former resistance members in South Vietnam. This "ordinance" stipulates that the South Vietnamese authorities shall establish special military courts in Saigon, Buon Ma Thuot, and Hue, and may establish mobile special military courts at any time to punish "criminals" whom they consider to "have destructive purposes" or "violate foreign or domestic security," and stipulates that "offenders who have already committed or are about to commit offences shall be punished." Moreover, once sentenced, "no appeal for retrial shall be allowed." In this way, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique can wantonly persecute the patriotic people of South Vietnam. Since the Ngo Dinh Diem clique promulgated this ordinance in May 1959, these "special military courts" have sentenced many former resistance members to death and long-term imprisonment on charges of so-called "murder" and "sabotage." For example, in the past few months, the Saigon Special Military Court has sentenced sixteen people to death and four people to life imprisonment with hard labor in eight trials. Among the sixteen people sentenced to death, five have been executed on the spot. One of them was beheaded and dissected, and the head and internal organs were put on display in the village administrative committee. The barbarity of these executioners reached the extreme.
    These appalling crimes fully expose the face of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, which follows the will of its American masters, violates the Geneva Accords, and is determined to be an enemy of the Vietnamese people.
    The recent "Bien Hoa Trial Case" is a signal of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique launching a large-scale and frenzied suppression of former resistance members and patriots in South Vietnam. Through the facts dripping with blood, the broad masses of the South Vietnamese people have become increasingly clear that under "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959," their lives have become unprotected and they may be executed or sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor at any time under trumped-up charges. In order to fight for the most basic right to survival, more and more people are rising up to resist. The South Vietnamese people's struggle against persecution is rising day by day.
    On January 18, Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, wrote a letter to Ansari, Chairman of the International Commission for Vietnam, strongly protesting against the South Vietnamese authorities' crimes of persecuting innocent people and demanding that the International Commission promptly force the South Vietnamese authorities to immediately revoke this illegal judgment, and first of all, to stop the South Vietnamese authorities from executing the death sentences against Wu Guangqing and the other three. These demands are undoubtedly completely justified. We believe that the International Commission, which is responsible for supervising and monitoring the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, should take immediate action to rescue the innocent victims, and should quickly force the South Vietnamese authorities to abolish "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959," stop the cruel retaliation and persecution against South Vietnamese patriots, former resistance members and groups, and ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords.

    拯救南越的无辜受害者
    本报评论员
    去年12月19日，南越特别军事法庭在边和省以捏造的“谋杀美国顾问”和“叛逆”的罪名判决前抗战人员吴光清、武文孔等六人死刑和长期徒刑。这是南越当局明目张胆地破坏日内瓦协议的又一铁证；也是南越当局残酷屠杀、镇压前抗战人员事件中情节最卑鄙的案件之一。
    吴光清等人在越南抗战时期都是抗战行政委员会的成员和救国会会员。和平恢复后，他们都在家里过着正常的生活。按照日内瓦协议第十四条丙款不得对前抗战人员进行报复和歧视的规定，他们的生命和安全是应该得到保障的。吴光清等人同1959年7月8日在边和省发生的袭击美国军事顾问的事件完全无关。他们当中有的人如武文孔甚至是在1955年就被捕的。可是，在南越的特别军事法庭在找不到任何证据来诬陷他们“谋杀”之后，竟援引“1959年第十号法令”，按“叛逆”罪判决！
    吴庭艳集团的“1959年第十号法令”是一项彻头彻尾的法西斯法令。它和吴庭艳集团在1959年8月25日到9月2日宣布的“对前抗战人员的政策”一样，是南越当局进一步破坏日内瓦协议、对南越前抗战人员进行大规模的血腥迫害的工具。这个“法令”规定南越当局在西贡、邦美蜀和顺化设立特别军事法庭，并得随时增设流动的特别军事法庭，惩办他们认为“具有破坏目的”或“侵犯国外或国内安全”的“罪犯”，并规定“不管已犯或即将违犯的犯法者都要受到惩处”。而且一旦判处，“不得上诉要求改判”。这样，吴庭艳集团就可以肆无忌惮地残害南越爱国人民。自从吴庭艳集团于1959年5月颁布这项法令以来，这些“特别军事法庭”以所谓“谋杀”、“破坏”等罪名，已判决了许多前抗战人员以死刑和长期徒刑。例如西贡特别军事法庭在过去几个月举行的八次审判中，已判处十六个人死刑，四个人终身苦役。在十六个被判死刑的人当中，有五人已当场执刑。其中一人被砍头、剖腹，头颅和五脏被放到村行政委员会示众，这些刽子手们的野蛮残暴到了极点。
    这些骇人听闻的罪行，充分暴露了吴庭艳集团秉承美国主子意旨、破坏日内瓦协议、执意与越南人民为敌的面目。
    最近的“边和审判案件”，是吴庭艳集团对南越的前抗战人员和爱国人士发动大规模疯狂镇压的一个信号。南越广大人民通过鲜血淋漓的事实，已愈来愈清楚地看到，在“1959年第十号法令”下，他们的生命变得毫无保障，随时都可能被莫须有的罪名处死或终身服劳役。为了争取起码的生存权利，愈来愈多的人起来进行反抗。南越人民反对迫害的斗争正日益高涨。
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼已于1月18日写信给越南国际委员会主席安萨里，对南越当局迫害无辜人民的罪行提出了强烈抗议，并要求国际委员会尽快地迫使南越当局立即撤销这个非法的判决案，首先是制止南越当局执行判处吴光清等三人死刑的判决案。这些要求，无疑是完全正当的。我们认为，负责监督和监察日内瓦协议在越南实施的国际委员会应该立即采取行动，拯救无辜的受害者，并且应该迅速迫使南越当局取消“1959年第十号法令”，停止对南越爱国者、前抗战人员和团体进行残酷报复和迫害，保证日内瓦协议的履行。
