Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 6th: In the first five days of Anshan Iron & Steel Company's first joint technical demonstration competition week this year, production achieved an all-around victory. From January 1st to 5th, major products such as steel, steel products, pig iron, steel billets, concentrate, metallurgical coke, and iron ore all overfulfilled their production plans. The average daily output level greatly exceeded the level of December last year. Among them, steel and steel products increased by 12.8% and 14.3% respectively compared with the average daily output level in December. This achievement shows that Anshan Iron & Steel Company's employees have already mounted the galloping horse of continued leap forward this year.

On the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, Anshan Iron & Steel Company's employees continued to exert their revolutionary efforts. Starting from the first second of this year, they launched a joint technical demonstration competition, promoted advanced experience in the competition, carried out technical innovations on a large scale, and closely integrated hard work with skillful work. Nearly two thousand leading cadres of various factories and mines, in the spirit of grasping tightly from the beginning and grasping tightly from start to finish, went deep into the front line of production from January 1st to fight alongside the workers. In just a few days, the employees of various factories and mines have realized more than a thousand major and minor technical innovations and created new production records more than five thousand times. In the technical demonstration competition, the employees of the Second Steelmaking Plant adopted a series of innovative measures, implemented rapid steelmaking, and strengthened furnace maintenance, which shortened the smelting time of each furnace of steel by one hour and forty minutes compared with December last year. The rolling mills, such as the First Primary Rolling Mill and the First Medium Plate Mill, have greatly exceeded their planned output of steel billets and steel products in the past five days due to technological innovation and the promotion of advanced experience.

From the beginning of this year, each shift and each type of work within the factories and mines cooperated with each other and created favorable conditions for each other. Large-scale cooperation was also launched between the factories and mines: raw materials guaranteed ironmaking, ironmaking guaranteed steelmaking, steelmaking guaranteed steel rolling, and transportation guaranteed production. Each link was tightly interlocked, and each link cooperated, thereby further exerting the production potential of the factories and mines.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th: Benxi Iron & Steel Company has achieved continuous daily red (超额完成) and all-around red (全面完成) from New Year's Day to the 4th. In the past four days, the average daily output of pig iron, steel, and steel products has completed 104.2%, 114.7%, and 128.9% of the plan, respectively. The state has produced 921 tons more pig iron, 834 tons more steel, and 883 tons more steel products. In the past few days, the average daily output level of these three products has increased by 4% to 13.8% compared with the fourth quarter of last year. The quality of all products meets national standards.

Since the beginning of the new year, the company's employees have tightly grasped the central link of promoting advanced experience and continuously improved the level of operational technology, so that production has maintained a sustained high output. In the past few days, the steel plant has vigorously promoted effective experiences such as the converter ground baking furnace method and the double-furnace steelmaking method. Electric furnace workers have vigorously promoted hot charging and advanced technology matching, implemented internal and external desulfurization methods in the furnace, broke through the raw material barrier, and greatly shortened the smelting time.

Since the beginning of the new year, the company's party organization has adopted the method of grasping both ends and driving the middle, vigorously organizing forces to break through weak links. The supply of ore from the Nanfen Open-pit Mine was not very good. The secretary of the Party committee personally took command and established a working group to go deep into the mine to help with the work, so that the ore production maintained a daily red. The Party committee of the steel plant discovered that although the output of electric furnace steel from the 2nd to the 3rd had completed the plan, the production level was not rising step by step, so it held a meeting overnight, mobilized all the propaganda and agitation forces, greatly encouraged efforts, and organized the promotion of advanced experience. On the 4th, the output of electric furnace steel increased by 14.2% compared with the 3rd.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The capital's steelworkers have achieved good production results in the first five days of the new year. The average daily output of steel is 31.4% higher than the daily output of the highest output month last year; the average daily output of steel products is 19.8% higher than that of December last year.

Since the beginning of the new year, the employees of the capital's iron and steel industry system have more widely promoted various advanced experiences. The Shijingshan Iron & Steel Company Experimental Plant carried out technical demonstrations and fully adopted advanced experiences such as non-baking furnace steelmaking within five days. The daily output greatly exceeded the plan, and the quality was also higher than that of December last year. The company's No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces have adopted a series of advanced measures such as reducing slag basicity, adjusting the burden line, stabilizing the furnace temperature, and rapidly tapping iron. Within five days, they have also produced more than 2,000 tons of pig iron more than planned. The leading cadres of various steel plants went to the workshops to work with the workers from New Year's Day and directed production in labor. (Attached picture)

    鞍钢本钢和北京钢铁工人新年建立新常规
    钢铁钢材日产水平高过去年
    新华社鞍山6日电　鞍山钢铁公司今年开展第一个联合技术表演竞赛周的头五天，生产上获得全线胜利。1日到5日，钢、钢材、生铁、钢坯、精矿、冶金焦炭、铁矿石等主要产品，都超额完成了生产计划，平均日产水平大大超过了去年12月份的水平，其中钢和钢材分别比12月份的平均日产水平提高12．8％和14．3％。这个成就表明，鞍钢职工今年已经跨上了继续跃进的骏马。
    鞍钢职工在去年大跃进的基础上，继续鼓足革命干劲，从今年的第一秒钟开始，就开展了联合技术表演竞赛，在竞赛中推广先进经验，大搞技术革新，将苦干与巧干紧密结合。各厂矿近两千名领导干部，本着一开始就抓紧和从头到尾都抓紧的精神，从1日起就深入生产第一线，同工人们一起奋战。在短短几天里，各厂矿职工已实现大小技术革新一千多项，创造新的生产纪录五千多次。第二炼钢厂职工在技术表演竞赛中，采取一系列的革新措施，实行快速炼钢，加强炉体维护，使每炉钢的冶炼时间比去年12月份缩短了一小时四十多分钟。第一初轧厂、第一中板厂等轧钢厂，由于革新技术和推广先进经验，五天来钢坯和钢材产量都大大超过计划。
    从今年一开始，各厂矿内部各班和各工种就互相协作，互相创造有利条件；各厂矿之间也展开了大协作，原料保炼铁，炼铁保炼钢，炼钢保轧钢，运输保生产，一环紧扣一环，环环协作，从而进一步发挥了各厂矿的生产潜力。
    新华社沈阳6日电　本溪钢铁公司从元旦到4日连续实现日日红、满堂红。四天来，生铁、钢和钢材的平均日产量分别完成计划104．2％、114．7％和128．9％；为国家多产了生铁九百二十一吨，钢八百三十四吨，钢材八百八十三吨。几天来，这三种产品的平均日产水平，比去年第四季度分别增长了4％到13．8％。所有产品的质量，都合乎国家规定标准。
    这个公司的职工进入新年以来，紧抓推广先进经验这一中心环节，不断提高操作技术水平，使生产保持了持续高产。钢厂几天来大力推广了转炉平地烘炉法、双联炼钢法等有效经验。电炉工人大搞热装和先进技术配套，推行炉内外脱硫办法，突破了原料关，并且大大缩短了熔炼时间。
    公司党组织进入新年以来，采取抓两头带中间的方法，大力组织力量突破薄弱环节。南芬露天矿矿石供应情况不太好，党委书记亲自挂帅成立工作组深入矿山帮助工作，使矿石生产保持了日日红。钢厂党委发现2、3日电炉钢产量虽然完成计划，但是生产水平不是步步高升，于是连夜召开会议，动员所有的宣传鼓动力量，大鼓干劲，组织推广先进经验，4日电炉钢的产量就比3日增长14．2％。
    新华社6日讯　首都的钢铁工人在新年头五天取得了良好的生产成绩。钢的平均日产水平比去年产量最高月份的日产量还高31．4％；钢材的平均日产水平比去年12月份提高19．8％。
    新年以来，首都钢铁工业系统职工更广泛地推广了各种先进经验。石景山钢铁公司试验厂开展技术表演，在五天之内全面采用了不烘炉炼钢等先进经验，每天的产量都大大超过计划，质量也比去年12月份提高。这个公司的一号、二号高炉采取降低渣碱度、调整料线、稳定炉温、快速出铁等一系列先进措施，五天内也比计划多产了两千多吨生铁。各钢铁厂的领导干部从元旦起就到车间同工人一起劳动，在劳动中指挥生产。（附图片）
