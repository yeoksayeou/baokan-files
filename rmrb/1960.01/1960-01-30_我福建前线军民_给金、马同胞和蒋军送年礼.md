Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 29th. As the military and civilians on the Fujian front celebrate the Spring Festival, they are sending a large number of New Year gifts and family letters to compatriots and Chiang troops on the islands of Kinmen and Matsu. The frontline radio station also broadcasted Cantonese opera, Min opera and other opera programs especially for them.

	Before the Spring Festival, the military and civilians on the front continued to use wooden boats, kites and other tools to send New Year cakes, peanuts, cigarettes, dried tangerines, canned food and various famous wines as gifts to the compatriots and Chiang troops on the islands of Kinmen and Matsu. There were also pictures and albums reflecting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and construction of the motherland in 1959, as well as Spring Festival family letters from some Chiang troops whose families are on the mainland. These family letters were all requested by the families of Chiang troops to be forwarded by the Fujian front troops, and were broadcast on the front radio station. Tian Liying, a woman from Dongshan Island, said in a letter to her husband, Chen Bao, in the Chiang army in Kinmen: "When you left home, A'zi was only seventy days old. Now he is in the second grade of elementary school, and his daughter has a job. We are living well. But you are alone on an isolated island. I usually worry about whether you are warm or cold, and now that the New Year is approaching, I hope you will return home soon to reunite and live a happy life with us."

    给金、马同胞和蒋军送年礼
    新华社福建前线29日电　福建前线军民在欢度春节的时候，给金门、马祖等岛上的同胞和蒋军官兵送去大批的年礼和家信。前线广播电台还专门为他们播送了粤剧、闽剧等戏曲节目。
    在春节前夕，前线军民就不断地用木船、风筝等工具，向金门、马祖等岛上的同胞和蒋军官兵，放送年糕、花生、香烟、干桔、罐头和各种名酒等礼物，并有反映祖国1959年工农业生产建设大跃进的图片和画册，以及家在大陆上的一些蒋军官兵的春节家书。这些家书，都是蒋军人员家属要求福建前线部队代为转达的，并在前线广播电台上作了播送。东山岛妇女田丽英给她在金门蒋军中的丈夫陈宝的信上说：“你离家的时候，阿子才七十天，现在他已经上小学二年级了，女儿有了工作。我们生活得很好。可是你却只身流落孤岛，平时忧你冷热，现在过年，更盼你早日回家团圆，同我们一起过幸福生活”。
