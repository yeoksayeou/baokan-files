Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: The news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of a multi-stage ballistic rocket into the Pacific Ocean has been greeted with cheers in socialist countries.

    The "Rodong Sinmun" of Korea, in an editor's note preceding the news, said that this launch of the Soviet rocket demonstrates that mankind has taken another step forward in conquering outer space, and that Soviet science continues to make new and great contributions to human science. The successful launch of the Soviet Union's powerful rocket has further strengthened the confidence of people all over the world in peace, and has once again struck a blow against the US imperialist aggressive bloc, which talks about "peace" but actually continues to prepare for war frantically.
    A commentator for the Mongolian Telegraph Agency published an article saying that 1960 has just begun, and Moscow has made peace-loving and progress-striving people all over the world happy and excited with news of great international significance.
    Bulgaria's "Rabotnichesko Delo" said that the successful launch of the rocket once again most convincingly confirms the enormous superiority of Soviet science and technology in manufacturing powerful rockets. Like the great achievements the Soviet Union has made in the past, this powerful rocket test demonstrates the great superiority of socialism over capitalism.
    Poland's "Trybuna Ludu" wrote that the successful launch of the Soviet rocket further consolidates the Soviet Union's leading position in space research. The Soviet Union has created rockets that are more powerful than past rockets. This victory of Soviet science and technology allows us to believe that 1960 will be a year of more sensational news of space flight.
    The German Democratic Republic's "Berliner Zeitung" said that the new rocket's engine has a powerful thrust, which indicates that today's space flight payload will be able to increase by about three times.
    Czechoslovakia's "Rudé Právo," in its commentary, hailed the astonishing accuracy with which the final-stage rocket model reached the water's surface, and praised the new achievements of Soviet scientists and engineers.

    兄弟国家舆论欢呼苏联发射新火箭成功
    苏联科学技术优势进一步巩固
    据新华社22日讯　苏联成功地向太平洋发射多级弹道火箭的消息在社会主义国家引起了一片欢呼。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”在写在消息前面的按语中说，苏联火箭的这一次发射说明人类征服宇宙空间又前进了一步，苏联科学对人类科学继续作出了新的伟大的贡献。苏联威力强大的火箭的发射成功进一步坚定了全世界人民对和平的信念，并又一次打击了嘴里谈“和平”而实际上继续疯狂地准备战争的美帝国主义侵略集团。
    蒙古通讯社评论员发表文章说，1960年刚刚才开始，莫斯科就以具有重大国际意义的消息使全世界爱好和平和争取进步的人们感到高兴和激动。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”说，火箭的成功发射再次最令人信服地确证了苏联科学和技术在制造威力强大火箭方面的巨大优越性。像苏联过去取得的巨大成就一样，这次威力强大的火箭试验表明了社会主义对资本主义的伟大优越性。
    波兰“人民论坛报”写道，苏联火箭的发射成功进一步巩固了苏联在宇宙研究方面的领先地位。苏联已经制造出了比过去强大火箭的威力更强大的火箭。苏联科学技术的这一胜利使我们能够认为，1960年将是有更多的宇宙飞行的轰动消息的一年。
    德意志民主共和国“柏林日报”说，新火箭的发动机具有强大的推力，这表明今天宇宙飞行的载重量将能够增加约三倍。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”在评论中欢呼最后一级火箭模型到达水面的惊人的准确性，并且盛赞苏联科学家和工程师所取得的这个新成就。
