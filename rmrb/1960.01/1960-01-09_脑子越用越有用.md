    The More You Use Your Brain, the More Useful It Becomes

    For a Communist Party member, achievements are never enough. Because the task the Party has given us is to change our motherland's "poor and blank" face, and to require us to work more, faster, better, and more economically, so that we can rapidly build socialism and communism.

    In this era where one day equals twenty years, time is more precious than gold. I want to run ahead of time, making one year do the work of several.

    This year, I want to strive to complete eight years' worth of work. I understand that the human brain is not like a machine. A machine can only move forward, backward, up, down, or rotate, and always has a maximum load. The human brain is different; there is no "limit." You can use it however you want, and the more you use it, the more useful it becomes. Technical innovation is also a "bottomless pit"; the more tricks you find, the more there are. I plan to realize 750 innovation suggestions this year.

    I want to follow the Party's teachings, promote the communist style, and help my comrades wholeheartedly and sincerely. I want to implement all 96 advanced technical experiences learned at the "Meeting of Heroes" in the shortest possible time, and enable all comrades in the factory to master them according to their different types of work. I want to help 150 comrades jump into the advanced ranks.

    This year, I want to systematically study philosophy, further understand the principles of revolution, lay the foundation for a proletarian worldview, so as to better understand, comprehend, and implement the Party's resolutions and policies, and be a good, obedient tool of the Party. I will ensure the excellent completion of the glorious tasks assigned to me by the Party, and resolutely implement the Party's general line.

    脑子越用越有用
    成绩，对于一个共产党员说来，总是不够的。因为党交给我们的任务是要改变祖国“一穷二白”的面貌，要我们工作得更多、更快、更好、更省，这样才能快速地建设社会主义和共产主义。
    在这一天等于二十年的时代里，时间比金子还贵重，我要跑在时间前面去，让一年当几年用。
    在今年一年中，我要争取完成八年的工作量。我懂得：人脑子不像机器，机器只能反顺、回来、上下移动或转动，而且总是有个最大负荷。人的脑子不同，没有什么“极限”，你要怎么用就怎么用，而且是越用越有用。技术革新也是个“无底洞”，窍门越找越多。我打算在今年一年中实现革新建议七百五十项。
    我要遵照党的教导，发扬共产主义风格，满腔热情地、诚心诚意地帮助自己的伙伴，要把在“群英会”上学到的九十六种先进技术经验，在最短时间里，全部实现，并让全厂的同志按不同的工种分别掌握。我要帮助一百五十位同志跃入到先进行列。
      今年我要系统地学习哲学，进一步懂得革命的道理，奠定无产阶级的世界观，以便更好地领会、理解、贯彻党的决议和政策，做好党的驯服工具。保证出色地完成党交给我的光荣任务，坚决贯彻执行党的总路线。
