Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 31st: Zhejiang Province had many areas that achieved the agricultural development program's grain and cotton targets ahead of schedule in the first year of communization. Among the province's 53 counties (cities), in 1959, 40 counties (cities) including Huangyan, Jinyun, Zhoushan, Shaoxing, Ningbo, Fenghua, Wenzhou, Yongkang, Cixi, Qingtian, Yueqing, Wenling, Lishui, Dongyang, and Yiwu had an average grain yield exceeding 800 jin per mu, accounting for more than 85% of the province's grain planting area.

In 1959, after the spring flower harvest, the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee proposed the "double exceeding" call of exceeding the plan and exceeding the contracted output for early rice. Under this call, Party committees at all levels focused on advanced models, organized competitions, and strengthened field management, achieving a bumper harvest of early rice. After the late rice transplanting, the Provincial Committee put forward the battle slogan of "late rice exceeding early rice," pushing the agricultural production movement to a new climax. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of commune members, with dauntless heroic spirit, overcame natural disasters such as drought, floods, and typhoons, and achieved late rice exceeding early rice. The unit area yield of more than 79.7% of the province's 9,686,000 mu of double-cropping late rice exceeded that of early rice.

Relying on the unparalleled superiority of the People's Communes and fully implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture is an important guarantee for the bumper harvests of grain and cotton in Zhejiang Province this year. Under the unified leadership and overall planning of the communes, the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agricultural production was implemented better than in any previous year. More than 8 million mu of continuous cropping late rice in the province were all transplanted within two days after the Beginning of Autumn, seven to ten days earlier than in previous years. Cotton sowing this year was also earlier than last year. The density of planting was generally higher than last year. Field management was done very meticulously, and during the harvest season, meticulous harvesting and threshing were carried out to bring every grain and every cotton boll home, thereby ensuring a bumper harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 31st: Hebei Province has 22 counties and cities and 343 communes that have achieved the grain targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. Among these cities, counties, and communes, Anguo County and another 24 communes have grain yields of over 800 jin per mu. Eleven counties, including Gaocheng, Zunhua, Zhengding, Cixian, Dingxian, Pingshan, and Xinglong, and 151 communes have average yields of over 500 jin per mu. Ten counties and cities, including Shijiazhuang City, Xingtai, Qinglong, and Tangxian, and 168 communes have average yields of over 400 jin per mu.

These cities, counties, and communes that have achieved the grain targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, relying on the great superiority of the People's Communes, have implemented the production policy of "more varieties, high yields, and more harvests," and have launched a large-scale high-yield movement, reforming backward farming systems. Many counties, communes, and production teams have cultivated large tracts of high-yield land of hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of mu. These high-yield fields have not only played a role in increasing production and achieving high yields, but also served as demonstration fields and command fields, promoting overall production increase.

The reason why these cities, counties, and communes were able to achieve the grain targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule is that Party organizations at all levels strengthened their leadership on the grain production front. Under the inspiration of the Party's general line for building socialism, from land preparation, sowing, and field management to the entire harvest production process, the county, commune, and production team Party organizations formed a strong professional front, with secretaries at all levels taking command and establishing specialized management agencies. Leading cadres also frequently went deep into the communes and teams to inspect work, conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution," and launched "learn from, catch up with, and surpass" competitions.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 31st: Anhui Province has 20 counties (cities) that have achieved and exceeded the grain yield per mu targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

In 1959, Anhui Province encountered a hundred-day drought. However, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of People's Commune members waged a hard struggle against the severe drought and finally overcame the disaster, achieving a bumper harvest. In terms of grain, nine counties in the Huaibei area, including Dangshan, Jieshou, Xiaoxian, Fuyang, Taihe, Woyang, Funan, Fengtai, and Sixian, have an average yield of over 500 jin per mu, exceeding the targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program, with Dangshan County exceeding 1,000 jin. Thirteen counties and cities south of the Huai River, including Yuexi, Zongyang, Tongcheng, Huaining, Taihu, Wuhu, Xuancheng, Wuwei, Shucheng, Chaoxian, Lai'an, Hefei City, and Anqing City, have an average yield of over 800 jin per mu, also exceeding the targets stipulated in the program, with Yuexi County exceeding 1,000 jin.

Such a great victory in agricultural production is mainly the result of the people of Anhui Province, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, holding high the red flag of the general line, giving full play to the powerful power of the People's Communes, comprehensively implementing the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution," and overcoming severe drought.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 31st: Jiangxi Province has 17 counties (cities), 363 communes, and 5,783 brigades that have achieved the average grain yield target of 800 jin per mu stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, among which Pingxiang, Guangfeng, and Linchuan counties had an average grain yield of over 1,000 jin per mu in 1959.

In 1959, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of commune members in these counties (cities), communes, and teams gave full play to the powerful power of the People's Communes, overcame natural disasters such as waterlogging, drought, and insects, and achieved a bumper harvest of grain. In Gan County, the early rice suffered the largest mountain flood disaster in recent years. More than 80,000 flood-fighting troops in the county waged a struggle with the flood to seize grain, and finally won a bumper harvest of early rice, ensuring that the annual grain yield per mu exceeded 800 jin. After overcoming the severe drought of more than 80 days without rain, Pingxiang County launched a fight against the severe insect plague that attacked the late rice. The People's Communes mobilized 400,000 people to launch four consecutive battles, using methods such as spraying pesticides, collecting egg masses, setting up moth-luring lamps, and pulling out bitter seedlings to kill insects in a concentrated manner, ensuring the normal growth of late rice.

These counties (cities), communes, and teams have made remarkable achievements in comprehensively implementing the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution." The implementation of rational close planting in light of local conditions in Nancheng County is one of the important factors for the county's average grain yield per mu reaching 880 jin. More than 1,000 indigenous fertilizer plants of various types were established in communes and production teams in Lianhua County, producing a large amount of indigenous fertilizer, which provided sufficient topdressing for various crops, ensuring a bumper harvest. Two hundred and fifty-nine pig farms were established by the communes in Guangfeng County next to low-yield fields, accumulating fertilizer on the spot and applying it on the spot, changing the low-yield appearance of the low-yield fields and ensuring that the county's average annual grain yield reached 1,066.5 jin per mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 31st: Jiangsu Province has 17 counties and cities that have achieved the grain production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

In the Suzhou area, which has always been praised as a land of fish and rice, the average annual yield of 5,440,000 mu of grain crops in the entire area in 1959 was 1,040 jin per mu, breaking the 1,000 jin mark. Pei and Pi counties, located on the edge of Weishan Lake and the Pi-Cang depression, have always been low-yield areas, and grain has to be supported from other places. However, in the first year after the realization of communization, they achieved a large-scale and substantial increase in production, achieving the grain targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and jumped from a grain-deficient county to a surplus-grain county.

In 1959, these areas all seized the major measure of expanding basic farmland, driving general farmland, and eliminating third-class farmland, processing and cultivating basic farmland, establishing examples, driving the general, and changing the backward; at the same time, vigorously carrying out mass movements, carrying out appraisals and competitions, and using the method of appraisal to continuously push the agricultural production movement to a climax.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 31st: In Liaoning Province, five counties, including Yingkou, Xinbin, Qingyuan, Gaiping, and Andong, and three suburban districts of Fushun, Andong, and Shenyang cities, the average grain yield per mu in 1959 exceeded the 400 jin target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, among which Yingkou and Xinbin counties reached 569 jin and 525 jin respectively, exceeding the mu yield level stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program for areas south of the Yellow River and north of the Huai River.

In 1959, these counties and cities all held high the red flag of the general line and the Great Leap Forward, gave full play to the superiority of the People's Communes, vigorously changed the farming habits of wide ridges, shallow plowing, and sparse planting, and comprehensively implemented the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution," thereby overcoming various natural disasters such as frost, drought, waterlogging, and insects, and achieved a bumper harvest.

    124县实现农业纲要粮食指标
    人民公社降龙伏虎 八字宪法保证高产
    浙江
    据新华社杭州31日电　浙江省在公社化第一年就有不少地区提前实现了农业发展纲要的粮棉指标。全省五十三县（市）中，1959年有黄岩、缙云、舟山、绍兴、宁波、奉化、温州、永康、慈溪、青田、乐清、温岭、丽水、东阳、义乌等四十个县（市）粮食平均亩产超过八百斤，占全省粮食种植面积85％以上。
    1959年，中共浙江省委在春花丰收以后，接着就提出早稻超规划、超包产的双超号召，各级党委在这一号召下，抓先进、搞竞赛，加强田间管理，获得早稻大丰收。晚稻插秧以后，省委又提出“晚稻超早稻”的战斗口号，把农业生产运动推向新的高潮。广大社员在党的领导下，以大无畏的英雄气概，战胜了旱、涝、台风等自然灾害，实现了晚稻超早稻。全省九百六十八万六千多亩双季晚稻，单位面积产量超过早稻的占79．7％。
    依靠人民公社的无比优越性，全面贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”，是今年浙江省各地粮棉获得大丰收的重要保证。各地在公社统一领导、全面规划下，农业生产“八字宪法”执行得比任何一年都好。全省八百多万亩连作晚稻在立秋后两天就全部插下秧苗，比往年提早七到十天。今年的棉花播种也都比去年提早。密植程度一般都比去年提高。田间管理都作得很精细，在收获时节，又作到细收细打、颗粮朵棉还家，从而保证了丰产丰收。
    河北
    据新华社天津31日电　河北省有二十二个县、市和三百四十三个公社提前实现全国农业发展纲要规定的粮食指标。在这些市、县、公社中，粮食亩产八百斤以上的，有安国一个县和另外二十四个公社。平均亩产五百斤以上的有藁城、遵化、正定、磁县、定县、平山、兴隆等十一个县和一百五十一个公社。亩产平均四百斤以上的，有石家庄市、邢台、青龙、唐县等十县、市和一百六十八个公社。
    这些提前实现农业发展纲要规定粮食指标的市、县和公社，依靠人民公社的巨大优越性，贯彻了多种、高产、多收的生产方针，开展起大面积高额丰产方运动，改革了落后的耕作制度。许多县、社、生产队都培养了百亩、千亩甚至万亩以上的大块丰产田，这些丰产田不仅发挥了高产多收增产的作用，还起着示范田、指挥田的作用，促进了全面增产。
    这些市、县和公社，所以能提前实现农业发展纲要规定的粮食指标，是各级党组织加强了粮食生产战线的领导。各地在党的建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，从整地、播种、田间管理到收获整个生产过程，县、社、生产队党组织都组成一条强有力的专业战线，各级书记挂帅，建立了专管机构。领导干部还经常深入到社、队检查工作，认真贯彻“八字宪法”，开展了“学、赶、超”的竞赛运动。
    安徽
    据新华社合肥31日电　安徽省有二十个县（市）已经提前实现和超过了全国农业发展纲要规定的粮食亩产指标。
    安徽省1959年遇到百日大旱，但是，广大人民公社社员在党的领导下，同严重的干旱展开艰苦的斗争，终于战胜灾害，获得了大丰收。在粮食方面，淮北地区有砀山、界首、萧县、阜阳、太和、涡阳、阜南、凤台、泗县等九县，平均亩产五百斤以上，超过了全国农业发展纲要规定的指标，其中砀山县已超过一千斤。淮河以南地区有岳西、枞阳、桐城、怀宁、太湖、芜湖、宣城、无为、舒城、巢县、来安、合肥市、安庆市等十三个县、市，平均亩产八百斤以上，也超过了纲要规定的指标，其中岳西县已超过一千斤。
    这样的农业生产大胜利，主要是安徽省人民在各级党委领导下，高举总路线红旗，发挥人民公社的强大威力，全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”和战胜严重干旱的结果。
    江西
    据新华社南昌31日电　江西省已有十七个县（市）、三百六十三个公社、五千七百八十三个大队提前实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的平均粮食产量每亩八百斤的指标，其中萍乡、广丰、临川等三个县1959年粮食平均每亩产量超过了一千斤。
    这些县（市）、社和队的广大社员，1959年在党的领导下，发挥人民公社强大的威力，战胜水、旱、虫等自然灾害，获得了粮食大丰收。赣县的早稻遭受到近年来最大的一次山洪灾害，全县八万多抗洪大军与洪水展开争粮的斗争，终于赢得早稻丰收，保证了全年粮食亩产量超过八百斤。萍乡县在战胜八十多天滴雨未下的大旱之后，又同袭击晚稻的特大虫灾展开搏斗。各人民公社出动四十万人，连续发起四次战役，用打药、采卵块、点诱蛾灯、拔苦心苗等办法，突击灭虫，确保了晚稻的正常生长。
    这些县（市）、社、队，在全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”中，作出了显著成绩。南城县因地制宜实行合理密植，就是全县粮食平均亩产量达八百八十斤的重要因素之一。莲花县各公社和生产队共建立各种土化肥厂一千多个，生产出大量土化肥，使各种作物追肥充足，保证了丰收。广丰县各公社在低产田旁建立田边养猪场二百五十九个，就地积肥，就地施用，改变了低产田的低产面貌，保证了全县全年粮食平均亩产量达到一千零六十六斤半。
    江苏
    据新华社南京31日电　江苏省已有十七个县市提前实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的粮食增产指标。
    在历来被称誉为鱼米之乡的苏州专区，1959年全区五百四十万亩粮食作物，平均每亩年产一千零四十斤，突破千斤大关。地处微山湖边和邳苍洼地的沛、邳等县，向来是低产地区，粮食要靠外地支援，但是在实现公社化以后的头一年，却取得了大面积大幅度的增产，提前实现农业发展纲要规定的粮食指标，从缺粮县一跃而为余粮县。
    1959年，这些地区都抓住了扩大基本田，带动一般田，消灭三类田的这一重大措施，对基本田加工培植，树立榜样，带动一般，改变落后；同时大搞群众运动，开展评比竞赛，用评比的方法，把农业生产运动不断推向高潮。
    辽宁
    据新华社沈阳31日电　辽宁省营口、新宾、清原、盖平、安东等五个县和抚顺、安东、沈阳等三个市郊区，1959年平均每亩粮食产量提前超额实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的四百斤的指标，其中营口、新宾两县更分别达到五百六十九斤和五百二十五斤，超过了农业发展纲要规定的黄河以南、淮河以北地区的亩产水平。
    这些县市1959年都高举总路线、大跃进的红旗，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，大力改变宽垅、浅耕、稀植的耕作习惯，全面贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，从而战胜了霜、旱、水、虫等各种自然灾害，取得了大丰收。（附图片）
