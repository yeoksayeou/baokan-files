Raise the Banner of Mao Zedong's Literary and Art Thought Higher
Lin Mo Han

(Continued from yesterday)

Based on the above understanding, I believe that the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism mainly includes three aspects: First, to see and reflect the new, revolutionary, and vital things in life; Second, the author must have a high degree of enthusiasm for this thing; Third, therefore, the work can have a high degree of strong inspirational power. The combination of these three is the manifestation of revolutionary romanticism. Empty fantasy that is fundamentally divorced from reality cannot inspire people. The difficulty in grasping revolutionary romanticism lies precisely in its requirement that writers have the ability to see the new, revolutionary, and vital things in life.

Another aspect is the technique of revolutionary romanticism. Romantic works often adopt more exaggeration, more fantasy elements, more mythological colors, and other expressive techniques. But it is not to say that only these are revolutionary romanticism. A work without the spirit of revolutionary romanticism, no matter how exaggerated it is or how many myths it uses, does not count as revolutionary romanticism. Some of Mao Zedong's poems have myths, and some do not, but every one is filled with the spirit of revolutionary romanticism.

To truly possess the spirit of revolutionary romanticism, the most fundamental issue is to have a revolutionary worldview, to have a close connection with the revolutionary people. Only in this way can we see the spirit of revolutionary romanticism in the people's lives and fully embody this spirit in our works.

And to do this, the fundamental method is to study Marxism-Leninism, to study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, and at the same time to go to the masses and integrate with the masses. These two aspects are indispensable. It is not right not to go to the masses. However, it is also not right to only go to the masses without studying Marxism-Leninism. It is not possible for a Marxist-Leninist worldview to arise naturally in that way. Lenin and Comrade Mao Zedong resolutely struggled against empiricists, who negate theory. We must study Marxist-Leninist theory, study Chairman Mao's works. Without study, we may be captured by various erroneous ideas.

In summary, Comrade Mao Zedong's multi-faceted and significant development of Marxist literary and artistic thought is a great contribution to the treasure house of Marxist thought and is the fundamental principle that we must follow in developing socialist literature and art.

Comrade Mao Zedong not only developed Marxist literary and artistic thought from the positive side, establishing a complete Marxist science of literature and art, but also made the most profound and sharp criticism of bourgeois literary and artistic thought. "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" had already thoroughly refuted the main points of revisionist literary and artistic thought. Revisionism is to revise Marxism with bourgeois viewpoints, to remove the revolutionary essence and revolutionary soul of Marxism. Although it often appears with a new face, it is still those few main old arguments in the final analysis. Expressed in literary and artistic thought, I feel that, just like in politics, it mainly includes the following aspects:

First, to reconcile class contradictions, blur class struggle, and use this method to achieve the goal of consolidating the old system. This is the fundamental characteristic of revisionists. One of the main arguments of the old revisionist Lukács is to distort Lenin's principle that different social systems can coexist peacefully under certain conditions, misinterpreting it as the peaceful coexistence of socialist and capitalist ideologies, without struggle. This "ideological coexistence" theory is exactly the same as Wang Renshu (Ba Ren)'s "seeking common ground while reserving differences," which is to "seek common ground" and "coexist" with the bourgeoisie ideologically. Lukács believes that since Lenin's death, the main contradiction determining the strategy of the Communist Party is not the contradiction between capitalism and socialism, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, but the contradiction between fascism and anti-fascism, which is to abolish class struggle. The American Communist Party's traitor Browder also advocated this. In order to blur class struggle, they put forward abstract "humanitarianism," theories of human nature, etc., to replace class character and Party spirit. The so-called "humanitarianism" is philanthropy, the kind of "love of humanity" that Comrade Mao Zedong criticized. Marx said, "The philanthropic school is the most perfect humanitarian school," they advocate speaking of "love" to all people. Today, this is the bourgeoisie's greatest trick to blur class boundaries and abolish class struggle, with the aim of protecting the inhuman and sinful capitalist system under the guise of "humanitarianism." If a working-class writer abandons socialism and communism and follows suit, talking about classless humanitarianism, it is surrender to bourgeois ideology. Comrade Mao Zedong had already profoundly and powerfully exposed and refuted the hypocrisy and deceptiveness of the theory of human nature and the so-called "love of humanity" etc. in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

Second, revisionists advocate abolishing the educational role of literature and art and oppose the purpose of literature and art serving politics. Abolishing the fundamental purpose of the proletarian revolution, turning the proletarian movement into an activity without revolutionary goals, is also one of the main arguments of revisionism. The old revisionist Bernstein said: "The ultimate goal is insignificant; movement is everything." The purpose of the proletarian revolution is to seize power and implement the dictatorship of the proletariat. Revisionists abolish the purpose of the revolution, which is to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat. In literature and art, they advocate that literature and art should not serve the tasks of the proletarian revolution, and literature and art should not have any educational role. This is the common tune of all revisionists. The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia writes: "The League of Communists simultaneously opposes any pragmatic distortion of the Marxist view of the role of science and art in society and opposes turning science and art into means of daily political interests." They slander literature and art serving politics as "pragmatic distortion" and degrade it as "means of daily political interests." In fact, refusing to serve the political interests of the proletariat is to serve the interests of the bourgeoisie. Qin Zhaoyang's saying that literature and art should not "become a megaphone for some political concept" has the same intention. In Yan'an, Wang Shiwei, Xiao Jun, and others also opposed literature and art serving revolutionary politics, attacking us as utilitarians. The Hu Feng elements hated this point even more. Zhang Zhongxiao said in a secret letter: "'Utilitarianism,' etc. This standard has suppressed genuine criticism and suppressed new things." Comrade Mao Zedong had already refuted this argument. He said that there is no kind of literature and art that does not serve politics, "There is no such thing as ultra-utilitarianism in the world. In class society, it is either the utilitarianism of this class or the utilitarianism of that class. We are proletarian revolutionary utilitarians, and we take the unity of the current and future interests of the broadest masses, who account for more than 90 percent of the total population, as our starting point. Therefore, we are revolutionary utilitarians with the broadest and farthest goals, not narrow utilitarians who only see the partial and the present."

Third, on the one hand, revisionists blur class boundaries and reconcile class contradictions, so that literature and art are separated from the purpose of revolution, thereby helping to consolidate the old world and consolidate the system of exploitation. On the other hand, they harbor deep hatred for the new society, the new system, and the revolutionary people. They try their best to uglify the new society, believing that the task of literature and art is to expose, and to expose and satirize the revolution, the people, and the new society. Their aim is to arouse people's dissatisfaction with the new society, spread pessimistic and disappointed emotions about the new world, and make the people lose confidence in the revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong thoroughly refuted this so-called argument of exposing darkness.

Obviously, Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" had already made the most sharp and profound criticism of the basic arguments of revisionist thought in literature and art. Modern revisionism is an international phenomenon, and it is not only a problem in literature and art, but more importantly, a problem in politics. Domestically, as long as the influence of bourgeois ideology exists, there will be revisionist thought. Internationally, with the existence of imperialism, there will be some people with weak wills who are frightened or bought off and become prisoners of revisionism. The declaration of the Moscow meeting of twelve Communist and Workers' Parties pointed out: "The existence of bourgeois influence is the domestic source of revisionism. Yielding to the pressure of imperialism is the foreign source of revisionism." Imperialism now adopts two methods: on the one hand, creating a war atmosphere to frighten the people, and some timid people are frightened and spread pacifist illusions among the people. On the other hand, adopting the method of buying off, giving you a position in parliament, giving you high wages, and creating a worker aristocracy. Also, giving you some bonuses, etc., is also a kind of buying off. And some people cannot resist these and do not understand the truth that "when the enemy praises you, you need to be more vigilant." On the contrary, they regard the praise of the bourgeoisie and imperialism as glory, which is very dangerous. Whether internationally or domestically, there are now sources of revisionist thought. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Revisionism, or right-leaning opportunism, is a bourgeois trend of thought, and it is more dangerous than dogmatism." Today, opposing modern revisionism is a major struggle of international significance.

Just like opposing revisionism in politics, when we oppose revisionist thought in literature and art, we must also grasp Mao Zedong Thought well and take Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought as the best weapon to defeat revisionist thought in literature and art.

This is my extremely superficial understanding of Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. If there are any errors, please criticize them.

Now, I will talk about the importance of literary and art workers studying Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly transforming their worldview.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the correct direction for creating socialist literature and art and put forward concrete principles and measures. Now the problem is how writers and artists can build and create socialist literature and art according to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions. Therefore, transforming the worldview of writers and artists and establishing a proletarian worldview is of decisive significance.

What revisionists oppose most is the communist worldview. They always cite Balzac and Tolstoy as examples to prove that writers can write great works without a correct worldview, and even believe that the more reactionary the worldview, the greater the works. From Lukács in Hungary to Hu Feng in China and Vidmar in Yugoslavia, they all use these two great writers as their weapons. Therefore, this issue must be clarified.

First of all, we must see that the relationship between socialist literature and society is fundamentally different from the relationship between old literature and society. If the old literature is most generally divided into two types: one is to praise and protect the old system, which is reactionary literature; the other is to expose and criticize the old system. The progressive significance of this literature mainly lies here. As Gorky said, the reason why critical realist literature has value is because those authors are "prodigal sons" of the bourgeoisie, who more or less, intentionally or unintentionally, exposed the darkness and sin of the capitalist system and showed the process of the development and disintegration of the capitalist system. They have a certain destructive effect on the old society and the old system, just as Engels said, arousing people's permanent suspicion of the capitalist system. Socialist literature is fundamentally different. Socialist literature defends the socialist social system and helps promote its development, rather than destroying it. Because the socialist system is a progressive system, a system that the people have dreamed of and struggled for for a long time, and it is the most rational system that has abolished the sinful phenomenon of man exploiting man. Therefore, our responsibility is to defend it and make it develop towards a higher communist society.

Criticizing the old society and the old system can be carried out from various ideological standpoints. Of course, the most progressive is to stand on the standpoint of the proletariat; however, many writers criticize the capitalist system from the standpoint of enlightened bourgeois elements, some from the standpoint of small producers, and even some from the standpoint of the aristocracy. The "Communist Manifesto" clearly states that there are various socialists, and they all criticize capitalism. There are "feudal socialists," although they "completely failed to understand the march of modern history," their criticism is "half lament, half lampoon; half an echo of the past, half menace of the future"; but sometimes it "hits the bourgeoisie in the heart, by their bitter, witty and incisive criticism." There is also a kind of "petty-bourgeois socialist" writer, "who, indeed, very acutely criticised the contradictions in modern conditions of production; he laid bare the hypocritical apologies of economists. He proved, incontrovertibly, the disastrous effects of machinery and division of labour; the concentration of capital and land in a few hands; overproduction and crises; he pointed out the inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery of the proletariat, the anarchy in production, the crying inequalities in the distribution of wealth, the industrial war of extermination between nations, the dissolution of old moral bonds, of the old family relations, of the old nationalities." Lenin put it very well, there are two kinds of criticism of capitalism: one is the criticism of capitalism by "the class that is to take the place of the bourgeoisie," namely the proletariat, and the other is the criticism of capitalism by "the classes that are to be replaced by the bourgeoisie." Criticism of capitalist society can be made from different standpoints, so there is no question of transforming the worldview for writers of the old era. Writers of various worldviews can criticize capitalism. (Of course, only by standing on the standpoint of the proletarian worldview can the most thorough and correct criticism be made.) Balzac was a royalist, he had deep sympathy for the aristocracy, and he himself wanted to pretend to be an aristocrat. He revealed the vulgarity and ugliness of the bourgeoisie, this upstart, precisely from the standpoint of the aristocracy. What was remarkable about him was that he profoundly revealed the laws of social development. Although he hated the vulgarity and ugliness of the bourgeoisie, he saw that this new force would inevitably rise to replace the aristocracy. Therefore, his work is a lament for the inevitable demise of the feudal aristocracy. Balzac quite profoundly exposed and criticized capitalist society, so Marx and Engels believed that his works had value. Tolstoy revealed the disasters of capitalism from the perspective of patriarchal small producers. He criticized the capitalist system, "not demanding the realization of socialism," but to "establish a society with a free and equal small peasantry". Lenin said that Tolstoy was a mirror of the Russian revolution because he reflected both the revolutionary emotions and demands of the Russian peasants at that time and the state of incomplete consciousness of most peasants. They did not use revolutionary struggle but fantasized about realizing their demands through crying, prayer, and petition. Lenin made the most profound scientific class analysis of Tolstoy's thought and works. He made it very clear that Tolstoy could not become a "mentor of life" because his doctrine of "non-resistance to evil" was reactionary and could not guide people forward. Lenin said very well: "The Russian people can only be liberated when they understand that they should not learn from Tolstoy to seek a better life, but from the class whose importance Tolstoy did not understand, the class that is the only one that can destroy the old world that Tolstoy hated, that is, learn from the proletariat."

Since socialist literature wants to defend and develop the socialist system and promote communist ideology, it is fundamentally impossible for writers and artists to not be socialists or communists or to not have a communist worldview. Revisionists do not recognize this fundamental change in the relationship, so they inevitably come to two conclusions: (1) The task of socialist literature and art is still mainly to expose, to criticize the new society, and to attack the new society, rather than to defend the new society. This is Qin Zhaoyang's view. (2) Writers and artists do not need to transform their thoughts, nor do they need to have any communist worldview. They want today's writers to take Balzac and Tolstoy as examples. It does not matter if their worldviews are backward or reactionary, and they even think that the more backward or reactionary their worldviews are, the better. This is, of course, very absurd. This is because they do not recognize that the relationship between socialist literature and society is fundamentally different from the relationship between the old literature and society.

Transforming the worldview of writers and artists is a key issue. As socialist and communist writers and artists, it is impossible not to have a communist worldview. Today, the so-called problem of worldview is essentially the problem of whether one is a democrat or a communist, a revolutionary fellow traveler, or a thorough Marxist. The so-called fellow traveler is someone who has been on the same road for a while during the democratic revolution stage, who agrees with the democratic revolution, and who participated in the democratic revolution, but when entering the socialist revolution stage, they are unwilling to continue on and want to part ways with the revolution. Chairman Mao pointed out a long time ago that many of our writers were revolutionary in the past, but during the socialist revolution stage, they became centrists, referring to this kind of fellow traveler. In reality, it is impossible to be a centrist. If one does not progress and become a revolutionary in the socialist revolution, one will lag behind, even becoming a rightist who opposes the Party and opposes socialism. In fact, this is exactly the case. Ai Qing is an example. He wrote some good poems during the democratic revolution, but later became a centrist and finally degenerated into a rightist.

Many of our comrades were ideologically prepared for the democratic revolution and deeply desired it. We have long been influenced by democratic revolutionary thought and wanted to transform China into a nation that is independent, democratic, and free. The results of the democratic revolution did not harm us either. We had no connection or little connection with the three major enemies of the democratic revolution, imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism. Therefore, we were able to fight resolutely. However, many people were not ideologically prepared for the socialist revolution. The socialist revolution came quickly and violently. Many people only had a vague desire for the socialist revolution and did not clearly understand what the socialist revolution was about. The socialist revolution not only eliminated the bourgeoisie but also completely eliminated the individual economy and the individualistic thoughts associated with the individual economy. In this way, the revolution penetrated into us, or even into our own minds, and many people could not accept it.

We intellectuals have countless ties with the bourgeoisie. Some people have various relationships directly with the bourgeoisie. Many people have connections with bourgeois intellectuals. They are friends or relatives to each other. And more generally, we have connections with bourgeois ideas because we were educated in the past by the bourgeoisie. The connections with bourgeois literature and art are even more numerous. We grew up under the influence of bourgeois literature and art and were deeply influenced by bourgeois literary and artistic thought. Gorky said that bourgeois culture is a mixture of honey and poison. We must learn from them, but we must see that they contain toxins, and they mostly carry strong individualism, anarchism, pessimism, and other negative factors. On the other hand, many of us are connected with wealthy peasants in rural areas and are easily influenced by them. In addition, the nature of our work is individual activity, and we are prone to becoming famous, so it is easy to breed individualistic thoughts and regard achievements as individual. Therefore, in addition to thoroughly solving the major problems in their worldview, such as how to correctly understand the Party's general line, how to treat the mass movement, how to establish the idea of combining continuous revolution and revolutionary stages, literary and art workers must also thoroughly eliminate individualistic thoughts. Individualism has always been illegal within the Party, and today it is also incompatible with the entire society because today's society is a socialist and collectivist society, and individualism has become a major obstacle to accepting socialism.

It should be said that the worldviews of the vast majority of our writers and artists are correct or basically correct. Since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, many literary and art workers have continuously transformed their thoughts, integrated with the masses, and have a communist worldview or are striving to become communists. The great achievements of our literary and art work are inseparable from this. However, there are still some people whose worldview problems have not been solved or have not been completely solved, which cannot but be reflected in their work, creation, and theoretical criticism. We sometimes have some deviations in our work, sometimes some bad tendencies in our creation, and some articles in theoretical criticism express bourgeois views, and even revisionist fallacies have appeared. The erroneous situations and sources are different, but they all illustrate the importance of thoroughly transforming the worldview and also illustrate a truth: as long as we deviate from Mao Zedong Thought, even if we deviate a little, we will make this or that mistake. Therefore, in order to do our work better and avoid mistakes and losses, our comrades in the literary and art circles must work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong Thought, use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, thoroughly transform our worldview; we must work hard to study and master Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and raise the banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought higher, so as to promote a greater leap forward in all fields of literary and art work.

    更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的旗帜
    林默涵
    （续昨）
    根据上面的认识，我认为革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合，主要的包括三个方面：第一，要看到和反映生活中的新生的、革命的、有生命力的事物；第二，作者对这种事物要有高度的热情；第三，因此作品就能具有高度的强烈的鼓舞力量。这三者结合起来，就是革命浪漫主义的表现。根本脱离现实的空洞的幻想，是不能鼓舞人的。要掌握革命浪漫主义之所以困难，正在于它要求作家具有从生活中看到新生的、革命的、有生命力的事物的能力。
    另一方面是革命浪漫主义的手法。浪漫主义的作品往往采用更多夸张，更多幻想成分，更多神话色彩等等的表现手法。但不是说只有这些才是革命浪漫主义。一个作品如果没有革命浪漫主义的精神，即使怎样夸张，用多少神话，也不算革命浪漫主义。毛泽东同志的诗词，有的有神话，有的没有神话，但每一首都充满了革命浪漫主义的精神。
    要真正具有革命浪漫主义精神，最根本的问题还是要有革命的世界观，要有和革命人民的密切结合，只有这样，才能够看到人民生活中的革命浪漫主义的精神，并且把这种精神充分地体现到自己的作品中。
    而要做到这样，根本的方法是学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的著作，同时要到群众中去，同群众结合，这两个方面缺一不可。不到群众中去是不行的。但是，只到群众中去而不学习马克思列宁主义，也是不行的，那样并不可能自然而然地产生马克思列宁主义的世界观。马克思列宁主义是一种科学。从群众的生活中可能获得某些符合马克思主义的个别观点，但不可能得到完整的马克思主义世界观。列宁、毛泽东同志与之坚决作斗争的经验主义者，就是否定理论的。我们必须学习马克思列宁主义的理论，学习毛主席的著作，不学习就可能被各种错误思想所俘虏。
    总起来说，毛泽东同志对于马克思主义文艺思想多方面的重大发展，是对马克思主义思想宝库的伟大贡献，是我们发展社会主义文学艺术所必须遵循的根本原则。
    毛泽东同志不仅从正面发展了马克思主义文艺思想，建立了完整的马克思主义的文艺科学，同时，又对资产阶级文艺思想作了最深刻最尖锐的批判。《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》实际上早已把修正主义的文艺思想的主要论点彻底驳斥了。修正主义，就是用资产阶级观点修改马克思主义，抽掉马克思主义的革命实质、革命灵魂。尽管它经常用新的面貌出现，但是归根结蒂还是那几个主要的老论点。表现在文艺思想上，我觉得也像在政治上一样，主要是这样几个方面：
    第一，调和阶级矛盾，模糊阶级斗争，用这种方法来达到巩固旧制度的目的。这是修正主义者的根本特点。文艺上的老修正主义者卢卡契的主要论点之一，就是歪曲列宁的认为不同社会制度在一定条件下可以和平共处的原理，把它曲解为社会主义思想和资本主义思想可以和平共存，不要斗争。这种“思想共存”论跟王任叔（巴人）的“竞异求同”论是一模一样的，就是要同资产阶级在思想上“求同”“共存”。卢卡契认为自从列宁逝世以后，确定共产党的战略的主要矛盾不是资本主义和社会主义、资产阶级和无产阶级的矛盾，而是法西斯和反法西斯的矛盾，这就是要取消阶级斗争。美国共产党的叛徒白劳德也是这样主张的。为了要模糊阶级斗争，他们就提出了抽象的“人道主义”、人性论等等来代替阶级性、党性。所谓“人道主义”，就是博爱主义，就是毛泽东同志批判过的那种“人类之爱”。马克思说过，“博爱学派是最完善的人道学派”，他们主张对所有的人都讲“爱”。在今天，这就是资产阶级用来模糊阶级界限、取消阶级斗争的最大骗术，其目的是在“人道主义”的幌子下来保护反人道的资本主义罪恶制度。工人阶级作家，如果丢掉社会主义、共产主义而跟着大讲其没有阶级性的人道主义，就是对资产阶级思想的投降。毛泽东同志早在《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》里深刻有力地揭穿和驳斥了人性论和所谓“人类之爱”等等的虚伪性和欺骗性。
    第二，修正主义主张取消文学艺术的教育作用，反对文学艺术为政治服务的目的。取消无产阶级革命的根本目的，把无产阶级运动变成没有革命目的的活动，这也是修正主义的主要论点之一。老修正主义者伯恩施坦就说过：“最终目的是微不足道的，运动就是一切”。无产阶级革命的目的是夺取政权，实行无产阶级专政，修正主义者取消革命的目的、就是取消无产阶级专政。在文学艺术上，他们主张文艺不要为无产阶级革命的任务服务，文艺不应该有任何教育作用，这是一切修正主义者的共同论调。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领里就写着：“共产主义者联盟同时既反对对马克思主义关于科学艺术在社会中的作用的观点作任何实用主义的歪曲，也反对把科学艺术变成日常政治利益的手段。”他们把文学艺术为政治服务，诬蔑为“实用主义的歪曲”，贬低为“日常政治利益的手段”。其实，拒绝为无产阶级的政治利益服务，就是为资产阶级的利益服务。秦兆阳说不要使文学艺术“成为某种政治概念的传声筒”，用意也是一样的。当年延安的王实味、萧军等人也反对文艺为革命的政治服务，他们攻击我们是功利主义者。胡风分子更恨透了这一点，张中晓的密信里说：“‘功利主义’，云云。这个标准压杀了真正的批评，压杀了新的东西”。毛泽东同志早就驳斥了这种论调，他说，没有那一种文艺是不为政治服务的，“世界上没有什么超功利主义，在阶级社会里，不是这一阶级的功利主义，就是那一阶级的功利主义。我们是无产阶级的革命的功利主义者，我们是以占全人口百分之九十以上的最广大群众的目前利益和将来利益的统一为出发点的，所以我们是以最广和最远为目标的革命的功利主义者，而不是只看到局部和目前的狭隘的功利主义者。”
    第三，修正主义者一方面模糊阶级界限，调和阶级矛盾，使文艺脱离革命的目的，这样来帮助巩固旧世界，巩固剥削制度。另一方面，他们对新社会、新制度，对革命人民，则怀着很深的仇恨，他们竭力丑化新社会，认为文艺的任务就是暴露，对革命、对人民、对新社会也要暴露，也要讽刺。其目的是挑起人们对新社会的不满，散布对新世界的悲观失望情绪，使人民丧失革命的信心。毛泽东同志对于这种所谓暴露黑暗的论调，作了彻底的驳斥。
    很明显，毛泽东同志的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》早就对文艺上修正主义思想的基本论点作了最尖锐、最深刻的批判。现代修正主义是国际的现象，而且不仅是文艺上的问题，更重要的是政治上的问题。在国内来说，只要还有资产阶级思想影响存在，就会有修正主义思想。在国际上，有帝国主义存在，就会有一些意志薄弱的人被吓倒或被收买，成为修正主义的俘虏。十二国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议宣言指出：“资产阶级影响的存在，是修正主义的国内根源。屈服于帝国主义的压力，则是修正主义的国外根源。”帝国主义现在采取两种方法：一方面制造战争空气，恐吓人民，一些胆怯的人便被吓倒，在人民中散布和平主义的幻想。另一方面采用收买的方法，给你议会的位置，给你高工资，制造工人贵族。还有，给你什么奖金等等，这也是一种收买。而有些人不能抵抗这些，不懂得“当敌人称赞你的时候，就需要更加警惕了”这个道理，相反，却把资产阶级、帝国主义的赞美当作光荣，这就十分危险了。无论在国际上或在国内，现在都有产生修正主义思想的根源。毛泽东同志指出：“修正主义，或者右倾机会主义，是一种资产阶级思潮，它比教条主义有更大的危险性。”今天反对现代修正主义，是一个具有国际意义的重大斗争。
    和在政治上反对修正主义一样，我们在反对文艺上的修正主义思想的时候，也要很好地掌握毛泽东思想，把毛泽东文艺思想作为战胜文艺上的修正主义思想的最好的武器。
    这就是我对毛泽东同志的文艺思想的极其粗浅的认识。如果有错误的地方，请同志们加以批评。
    现在，我谈谈文艺工作者学习毛泽东思想，彻底改造世界观的重要性。
    毛泽东同志为创造社会主义文艺指出了正确的方向，并且提出了具体的方针和措施，现在的问题是，作家艺术家如何按照毛泽东同志的指示来建设和创造社会主义的文艺，因此，改造作家艺术家的世界观，建立无产阶级的世界观，就具有决定性的意义。
    修正主义者最反对的，就是共产主义的世界观。他们总是举出巴尔扎克和托尔斯泰做例子，证明作家没有正确的世界观，也可以写出伟大的作品来，甚至认为世界观愈反动，作品就愈伟大。从匈牙利的卢卡契起，到中国的胡风、南斯拉夫的维德马尔，都拿这两位大作家来做他们的武器。因此，必须把这个问题弄弄清楚。
    首先我们要看到，社会主义文学同社会的关系跟旧的文学同社会的关系已经根本不同了。旧的文学如果最概括地讲有两种：一种是歌颂和保护旧制度的，这是反动的文学。一种是揭露和批判旧制度的，这种文学所以有进步意义，主要就在这里。正如高尔基所说，批判的现实主义文学所以有价值，是因为那些作者是资产阶级的“浪子”，他们或多或少、有意无意地揭露了资本主义制度的黑暗和罪恶，表现了资本主义制度的发展和瓦解的过程。它们对旧社会、旧制度有一定的破坏作用，正如恩格斯所说的，引起人们对资本主义制度的永久性的怀疑。社会主义文学则根本不同了。社会主义文学对社会主义的社会制度是保卫它、帮助促进它的发展，而不是破坏它。因为社会主义制度是进步的制度，是人民长期梦想和奋斗得来的制度，是废除了人剥削人的罪恶现象的最合理的制度。所以我们的责任是保卫它，并且使它向更高的共产主义社会发展。
    批判旧社会、旧制度，是可以站在各种不同的思想立场来进行的。当然，最进步的是站在无产阶级的立场；但是，许多作家是站在资产阶级开明分子的立场来批判资本主义制度的，有的是站在小生产者的立场，甚至有的是站在贵族的立场来批判的。《共产党宣言》中讲得很清楚，有各种社会主义者，他们都对资本主义进行批判。有“封建的社会主义”者，虽然他们“完全不能理解现代历史进程”，他们的批判是“半是哀怨，半是讥讽；半是过去的余音，半是未来的恫吓”；但有时候“也能用辛辣、俏皮而尖刻的评判刺中资产阶级的心”。还有一种“小资产阶级的社会主义”作家，“他们虽然站在无产阶级方面反对资产阶级，但是他们在批评资产阶级制度的时候，总是用小资产阶级和小农的尺度来衡量资产阶级制度，他们在维护工人事业的时候总是从小资产阶级的观点出发。”列宁讲的很好，有两种对资本主义的批判：一种是“要取资产阶级而代之的那个阶级”即无产阶级对资本主义进行的批判，另外一种是“被资产阶级所取而代之的那些阶级”对资本主义进行的批判。对资本主义社会的批判可以站在不同的立场，所以对于旧时代的作家并不发生改造世界观的问题，各种不同世界观的作家都可以对资本主义进行批判。（当然，只有站在无产阶级世界观的立场，才能作最彻底、最正确的批判。）巴尔扎克是一个保皇主义者，他对贵族有深切的同情，他自己就想冒充贵族，他正是站在贵族的立场揭露资产阶级这个暴发户的庸俗和丑恶的，他的了不起的地方在于他深刻地揭露了社会发展的规律，他虽然讨厌资产阶级的庸俗和丑恶，却看出了这个新的势力必然要起来代替贵族，所以，他的作品是对于封建贵族必然要灭亡的挽歌。巴尔扎克相当深刻地揭露和批判了资本主义社会，所以马克思、恩格斯认为他的作品有价值。托尔斯泰是站在家长制的小生产者的观点来揭露资本主义的灾难的，他批判资本主义制度，“不是要求实现社会主义”，而是要“建立一种自由平等的小农的社会制度”。列宁说托尔斯泰是俄国革命的镜子，是因为他既反映了当时俄国农民的革命情绪和革命要求，又反映了大部分农民还不够觉悟的状态，他们不是用革命斗争，而是幻想用哭泣、祈祷、请愿来实现自己的要求。列宁对托尔斯泰的思想和作品作了最深刻的科学的阶级分析。他说得很清楚，托尔斯泰不能成为“生活的导师”，因为他的“对恶不抵抗”的学说是反动的，是不能引导人们前进的。列宁讲得很好：“俄国人民只有在懂得他们不应该向托尔斯泰学习求得较好的生活，而应该向托尔斯泰所没有了解其重要性的那个阶级、向唯一能摧毁托尔斯泰所憎恨的旧世界的那个阶级，即是向无产阶级学习的时候，才能得到解放。”
    社会主义文学既然要保卫和发展社会主义制度、宣传共产主义思想，而作家艺术家却不是社会主义者、共产主义者，却没有共产主义的世界观，这是根本不可能的。修正主义者正是不承认这种关系的根本改变，所以必然得出两个结论，就是：（一）社会主义文学艺术的任务仍然主要是揭露，是批评新社会，攻击新社会，而不是保卫新社会。秦兆阳的主张就是这样。（二）作家艺术家用不着改造思想，也不要有什么共产主义世界观。他们要今天的作家们以巴尔扎克、托尔斯泰为榜样，世界观落后或反动也不要紧，甚至认为世界观越落后越反动越好。这当然是很荒谬的。这是因为他们不承认社会主义的文学同社会的关系已经跟旧的文学同社会的关系根本不同了。
    改造作家艺术家的世界观是一个关键问题，作为社会主义的共产主义的文学家、艺术家，不能没有共产主义世界观。在今天，所谓世界观的问题，实质上就是民主主义者还是共产主义者的问题，是革命的同路人，还是彻底的马克思主义者的问题。所谓同路人就是在民主革命阶段曾经同过一段路，赞成民主革命，参加过民主革命，而进入社会主义革命阶段时，他们却不愿意继续走下去，要同革命分手了。毛主席在很早就指出，我们许多作家过去是革命派，到社会主义革命阶段却变成了中间派，就是指的这种同路人。实际上，做中间派是不可能的，不是进步，变成社会主义革命中的革命派，就要落后，以至成为反党反社会主义的右派。事实上正是如此，艾青就是一个例子。他在民主革命时曾经写过一些好诗，以后却变成中间派，最后堕落成为右派分子。
    我们许多同志对民主革命是有思想准备、有深切要求的。我们长期以来受民主革命思想的熏陶，要把中国变成民族独立、民主自由的国家。民主革命的结果对我们也没有损失，我们同民主革命的三大敌人帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资本主义没有联系或者联系较少，因此能够坚决斗争。但是，对于社会主义革命，很多人就没有思想准备了，社会主义革命来得快，来得猛，很多人对社会主义革命只有朦胧的要求，社会主义革命究竟如何并不清楚。社会主义革命不但消灭资产阶级，而且还要彻底消灭个体经济，以及同个体经济相联系的个人主义思想。这样，革命就深入到我们身上，或者革到我们自己的脑子里来了，许多人就不能接受了。
    我们这些知识分子同资产阶级有千丝万缕的联系。一部分人直接同资产阶级有各种关系，很多人同资产阶级知识分子有联系，彼此是朋友或亲戚，而更普遍的是同资产阶级思想有联系，因为我们过去受的是资产阶级的教育。同资产阶级文艺的联系则更多，我们在资产阶级文艺的熏陶下成长起来，受资产阶级文艺的思想影响很深。高尔基说过，资产阶级文化是蜜糖和毒药混合在一起的。我们要学习它们，但必须看到它们是包含毒素的，它们大多带有浓厚的个人主义、无政府主义、悲观主义等等消极因素。另一方面，我们许多人都同农村的富裕农民有联系，很容易受到他们的影响。再加上我们的工作性质是个人活动，又容易出名，因此很容易滋长个人主义思想，把成就看成是个人的。所以，文艺工作者除了必须彻底解决世界观中的重大问题：如何正确认识党的总路线，如何对待群众运动，如何树立不断革命论和革命阶段论相结合的思想等等以外，还必须彻底清除个人主义的思想。个人主义在党内一直是不合法的，而今天则和整个社会也是格格不入的了，因为今天的社会是社会主义、集体主义的社会，个人主义已成为能不能接受社会主义的一个重大障碍。
    应该说，我们的作家艺术家绝大多数人的世界观是正确或者基本正确的。延安文艺座谈会以来，很多文艺工作者不断改造思想，同群众结合，已具有共产主义世界观，或者正在努力使自己成为共产主义者。我们文艺工作的伟大成就跟这一点是分不开的。但是，还有一些人的世界观问题没有解决，或者没有完全解决，这就不能不表现在工作上、创作上、理论批评上。我们在工作上有时出现一些偏差，在创作上有时出现一些不好的倾向，在理论批评上有些文章表现了资产阶级的观点，甚至出现了修正主义的谬论。错误的情况和根源是各有不同的，但是都说明了彻底改造世界观的重要性，并且也说明了一条真理，就是：只要离开了毛泽东思想，哪怕稍微离开一些，都会发生这样或那样的错误。所以，为了把工作做得更好，避免错误和损失，我们文艺界的同志们一定要努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东思想，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，彻底改造我们的世界观；我们要努力学习和掌握毛泽东同志的文艺思想，更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的旗帜，以推动文艺工作各个领域的更大跃进。
