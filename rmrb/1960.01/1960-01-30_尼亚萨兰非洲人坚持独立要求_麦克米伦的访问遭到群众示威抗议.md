Xinhua News Agency, Blantyre, January 27th: When British Prime Minister Macmillan arrived in Blantyre, Nyasaland from Northern Rhodesia on the 25th during his "visit" to Central Africa, a large group of Nyasaland Malawi Congress Party youth held demonstrations around the airport. A large contingent of police forces was heavily guarded inside and outside the airport, and arrested six demonstrators.

The demonstrators angrily shouted, "This shows that this country is a police state," and waved placards that read: "Down with the (Central African) Federation," "Africa should be free now," and "Mac, take your thugs back home." The demonstrators also threw stones at Macmillan's car.

Reuters admitted that this was a "truly hostile African nationalist demonstration."

On the same day, Malawi Congress Party Chairman Chirwa submitted a memorandum to Macmillan demanding that Nyasaland secede from the "Central African Federation" and become independent, and demanding the establishment of a government elected under universal adult suffrage, in which Africans would constitute a majority in the legislative and administrative bodies. The memorandum also demanded an end to the "state of emergency" and the release of Nyasaland African National Congress Chairman Banda. The memorandum also condemned the British government and the Monckton Commission established to maintain the "federation."

    尼亚萨兰非洲人坚持独立要求
    麦克米伦的访问遭到群众示威抗议
    据新华社27日讯　布兰太尔消息：正在中非“访问”的英国首相麦克米伦25日从北罗得西亚到达尼亚萨兰的布兰太尔时，一大群尼亚萨兰马拉维国民大会党的青年在机场周围举行示威。一大批警察部队在机场内外戒备森严，并且逮捕了六名示威者。
    示威者愤怒地高呼：“这表明这个国家是一个警察国家”，并且挥舞着手中的标语牌，标语牌上写着：“该死的（中非）联邦”、“非洲现在就应该自由”、“麦克，把你的匪徒带回国去”。示威者还向麦克米伦的汽车扔石头。
    路透社承认，这是一次“真正敌对的非洲民族主义示威”。
    当天，马拉维国民大会党主席契尔瓦向麦克米伦递交了一份备忘录，要求尼亚萨兰脱离“中非联邦”而独立，并且要求建立一个非洲人在立法和行政机构中都占多数以及在一切成年人都有选举权的情况下选出来的政府。备忘录还要求结束“紧急状态”和释放尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会主席班达。备忘录还谴责英国政府及继续保持这个“联邦”而成立的蒙克顿委员会。
