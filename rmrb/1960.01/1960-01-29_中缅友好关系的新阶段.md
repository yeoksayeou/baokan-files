    A New Stage in Sino-Burmese Friendly Relations
    After several days of friendly, sincere, and candid talks, Premier Zhou Enlai of our country and Prime Minister Ne Win of the Union of Burma achieved great success, leading to the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Agreement on Boundary Issues. The joint communiqué stated: "The two Prime Ministers are convinced that the conclusion of the above-mentioned treaty and agreement will be a lasting symbol of the growing friendship and mutual understanding between New China and New Burma." Premier Zhou Enlai said: "The signing of this treaty and agreement marks the entry of our two countries' friendly relations into a new stage." The Chinese people warmly applaud this significant development in the history of Sino-Burmese friendly relations.
    The Sino-Burmese boundary issue is a complex problem left over by imperialism. Before Burma gained independence and the People's Republic of China was founded, imperialism created many artificial disputes on the Sino-Burmese border, using this to provoke friendly relations between China and Burma. After we each gained independence, we had the possibility of resolving this issue on a new basis, because we both had the desire to prevent imperialist plots from succeeding.
     For several years, the leaders of the Chinese and Burmese governments, in the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have continuously exchanged views on this issue, creating conditions for gradually resolving it. In November 1956, Premier Zhou Enlai of our country and former Prime Minister U Nu of the Union of Burma reached a temporary arrangement for the Chinese army to withdraw from the area west of the 1941 line and the Burmese army to withdraw from the three places of Pianma, Gunong, and Gulang, in order to facilitate a comprehensive resolution of the boundary issue. The Chinese and Burmese governments have both abided by this agreement, and each has withdrawn armed forces from the specified areas within the specified time. The achievement and implementation of this temporary agreement has not only guaranteed the tranquility of the border between the two countries, but also provided extremely favorable conditions for the final resolution of the boundary issue. Now, after Prime Minister Ne Win's personal visit and friendly discussions between the two Prime Ministers, an agreement on the boundary issue between the two countries has finally been concluded, and principled agreements have been reached on various specific issues, paving the way for a comprehensive resolution of the Sino-Burmese boundary issue. Prime Minister Ne Win rightly said in his speech at the banquet: "We were able to conclude an agreement during our short stay that almost completely resolves the boundary issue that has been unresolved for nearly a century. This is due to the political vision of the two governments, as well as the Five Principles based on peaceful coexistence." At the same time, this also proves that such a complex issue as the boundary issue can be effectively and rapidly resolved by first reaching a principled agreement between the two Prime Ministers and then entrusting the specific solution to the representatives of both sides.
    While signing the agreement on the boundary issue, the Chinese and Burmese Prime ministers also signed the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression. This treaty is further development of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which were jointly initiated by the two countries. There is no doubt that this treaty will become an important milestone in the friendly relations between China and Burma. China and Burma have a long tradition of friendship. Since China and Burma each freed themselves from the oppression of imperialism, this friendship has had an increasingly solid foundation for development. Both of our countries are economically backward countries, and we both urgently need to carry out peaceful construction. We only have the common desire to maintain independence, build our countries, and cooperate in a friendly manner, and there are no fundamental conflicts of interest that would cause us to be hostile to each other.
    The Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression embodies the "Pauk-Phaw" relationship between our two peoples, as close as siblings. We firmly believe that after the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression, the close friendship between our two countries will inevitably develop day by day. As Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out, the signing of this treaty and agreement is a victory for the people of our two countries and a victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This treaty also "more forcefully confirms the belief that independent Asian and African countries should and can unite in friendship, and creates a new model for the development of this unity and friendship among Asian and African countries."
    General Ne Win, Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, made a valuable contribution to strengthening the friendly cooperation between China and Burma during his visit to our country at our invitation. Prime Minister Ne Win said: "I believe that the conclusion of the above-mentioned agreement and treaty will be a new milestone in Sino-Burmese relations and will be forever recorded in history. They will not only further deepen the traditional friendship between our two countries, but will undoubtedly play a huge role in consolidating and further strengthening the friendly cooperation between the two countries." We sincerely thank Prime Minister Ne Win for his efforts in promoting the friendship between the two countries, for bringing the deep friendship of the Burmese people to the Chinese people, and for bringing back the Chinese people's deep friendship to the Burmese people. We are willing to wish that China and Burma will jointly make greater contributions to the unity of Asian and African countries and to peace in Asia and the world! May the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples last forever!

### 中缅友好关系的新阶段

    中缅友好关系的新阶段
    我国总理周恩来和缅甸联邦总理奈温经过几天的友好、诚挚、坦率的会谈，取得了很大的成就，导致了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅两国关于边界问题的协定的签订。联合公报说：“两国总理深信，上述条约和协定的缔结将是新中国和新缅甸之间的友谊和互相了解日益增长的持久标志。”周恩来总理说：“这个条约和协定的签订标志着我们两国的友好关系进入了一个新的阶段。”中国人民热烈地为中缅友好关系史上的这一重大进展而欢呼。
    中缅两国的边界问题是帝国主义遗留下来的一个复杂问题。在缅甸获得独立和中华人民共和国成立以前，帝国主义在中缅两国的边界上制造了许多人为的争端，借此挑拨中缅两国的友好关系。在我们各自取得独立以后，我们就有了在新的基础上解决这个问题的可能，因为我们都有着不让帝国主义阴谋得逞的愿望。
     几年以来，中缅两国政府的领导人，本着和平共处五项原则的精神，就这一问题不断地交换了意见，为逐步解决这一问题创造条件。在1956年11月，我国周恩来总理和缅甸联邦前总理吴努就达成了中国军队撤出1941年线以西地区和缅甸军队撤出片马、岗房和古浪三个地方的暂时性的安排，以利于边界问题的全面解决。中缅两国政府都遵守了这项协议，各自从规定的地区在规定的时间内撤出了武装部队。这项临时协议的达成和实施不仅一直保证了两国边境的安宁，而且为最后解决边界问题提供了极其有利的条件。现在，经过奈温总理的亲自来访和两国总理的友好商谈，终于缔结了关于两国边界问题的协定，就各项具体问题达成了原则性的协议，为全面解决中缅边界问题铺平了道路。奈温总理在宴会上的讲话中说得对：“我们能在短促的逗留期间就缔结了差不多最后解决了近百年来一直无法解决的边界问题的协定。这一方面是由于两国政府的政治远见，同时也是由于有以和平共处为基础的五项原则。”同时，这也证明了像边界问题这样复杂的问题，由两国总理首先取得原则协议，再交由双方的代表去加以具体解决，是一条有利于问题获得迅速解决的切实可行的途径。
    中缅两国总理在签订关于边界问题的协定的同时，还签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约。这个条约，是两国共同倡议的关于和平共处五项原则的进一步发展。毫无疑问，这个条约将成为中缅两国友好关系的一个重要里程碑。中国和缅甸有着悠久的传统友谊。从中缅两国各自摆脱帝国主义的压迫的时候起，这种友谊就具有日益发扬光大的基础。我们两国都是经济上落后的国家，我们都迫切需要进行和平建设，我们只有维护独立、建设国家、友好合作的共同愿望，而没有任何根本的利害冲突，致使我们互相敌视。
    中缅友好和互不侵犯条约，体现了我们两国人民亲如手足的“胞波”关系。我们坚定地相信，在中缅友好和互不侵犯条约签订之后，我们两国的亲密友谊必将日益发展。诚如周恩来总理指出的，这个条约和协定的签订，是我们两国人民的胜利，是关于和平共处五项原则的胜利。这个条约也“更有力地证实了独立了的亚非国家应该而且可以团结友好的信念，并且为发展亚非国家的这种团结友好创造了一个新的范例”。
    缅甸联邦总理奈温将军，这次应邀访问我国，对于加强中缅两国的友好合作，作出了可贵的贡献。奈温总理说：“我相信上述协定和条约的缔结将作为中缅关系中的一个新的里程碑而永垂青史。它们不仅进一步加深了我们两国之间的传统友谊，而且无疑地将在巩固和进一步加强两国间的友好合作方面发挥巨大的作用。”我们衷心地感谢奈温总理为促进两国友谊所作的努力，感谢他带来了缅甸人民对中国人民的深厚友谊，并且即将把中国人民对缅甸人民的亲切情谊带回去。我们愿祝中缅两国共同为亚非国家的团结，为亚洲和世界的和平，作出更大的贡献！祝中缅两国人民的友谊万古长青！
