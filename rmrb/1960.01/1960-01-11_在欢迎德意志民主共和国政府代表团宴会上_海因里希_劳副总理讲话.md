Respected Comrade Li Xiannian, Vice Premier, dear comrades and friends:

We are very pleased to accept the invitation from the People's Republic of China, our loyal and powerful ally in the Far East.

We are deeply convinced that our visit will also help to further deepen the close friendly relations between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China.

The people of the German Democratic Republic are watching the leaping socialist construction of the People's Republic of China with great interest and concern. The working people of the German Democratic Republic express their great praise and admiration for the great achievements and new achievements that the Chinese people have already made and are making every day in the cause of socialist construction, and for their comprehensive Great Leap Forward movement. These achievements will also inspire our people to make goal-oriented efforts to realize the great tasks of our seven-year plan. This plan will make socialism victorious in the German Democratic Republic.

The fraternal Chinese people have consistently given great selfless assistance to the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic, and have always resolutely supported our struggle to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys and to eliminate the dangerous hotbed of West Berlin by turning West Berlin into a demilitarized free city, that is, to safeguard European peace by restraining German militarism and imperialism. The government and people of the German Democratic Republic highly value this great friendship of the People's Republic of China.

The close cooperation and fraternal friendship between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China will strengthen the great fraternal alliance of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and enhance all the forces that are fighting for world peace, national independence and social progress.

If the trend of international situation easing is stronger today and more and more important figures in capitalist countries are talking about the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, then this is primarily the result of the consistent peaceful policy pursued by the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp. This peaceful policy is exerting an increasing influence due to the great achievements made by socialist countries in socialist construction and communist construction, thus continuously changing the international balance of power in a direction favorable to the forces of peace. The overall superiority of the socialist social system over the capitalist social system has become increasingly obvious today, and now the anti-colonialist national liberation movement has not only swept across Asia, but also swept across the African continent and the people of Latin American countries. All of this puts the imperialist forces – the forces of the Cold War and hot war – in a dead end. Even the governments of imperialist countries are increasingly forced to consider the universal desire of the people of all countries for easing tensions and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems in their policies, if they do not want to become more isolated in front of their own people and the masses of people around the world.

The situation shows that it is becoming increasingly difficult for imperialism to pursue policies against the interests of the people of all countries. However, today's ruling clique in West Germany is unwilling to understand this and continues its policies of Cold War, atomic armament, and suppression of all democratic forces. They are today the most stubborn opponents of any easing of the international situation, because they fear the peaceful competition between the two Germanys on German soil.

West German imperialists are attempting to expand their sphere of influence by force to the German Democratic Republic and other neighboring countries in Europe. They are pursuing expansionist and colonialist policies towards Asian and African countries. They are enemies of international détente and threaten peace most seriously with their wild plans.

As everyone knows, the West German government asserts that the Bonn state is the sole legitimate representative of all of Germany. This statement is in sharp contradiction with the reality of the co-existence of the peace-loving German Democratic Republic and the imperialist West German state, and will give the Bonn government a justification under international law to justify their intention to invade the German Democratic Republic. In order to achieve the goal of hegemony, the Bonn government is attempting to prevent other countries from establishing normal diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic by means of pressure and brutal interference in the internal affairs of other countries. However, these policies of trampling on the sovereignty of other countries are increasingly losing their effect. The governments of many countries, especially the governments of Asian and African countries, are increasingly recognizing the need to maintain normal relations with the two Germanys in order to contribute to the easing of the international situation. The people of these countries have waged and are waging arduous struggles against imperialism. Establishing one-sided diplomatic relations with West Germany can only benefit Bonn's expansionist war intentions, and violate the interests of their own people and the German people.

The conclusion of a peace treaty with the two Germanys and the settlement of the West Berlin issue, as demanded by the German Democratic Republic, are the most important tasks that Europe must solve at present in order to prevent West German imperialism from launching a new war. Now is the time to finally end the Second World War, which has been suspended for fifteen years, in order to create the preconditions for a unified, truly democratic and peace-loving German state.

The unremitting efforts made by the Soviet Union to strive for peace, especially the achievements made by N.S. Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, during his important visit to the United States, is the understanding reached on holding a summit conference; this conference will be held in Paris in May this year. The main issues to be discussed at the summit will be disarmament, the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two Germanys, and the normalization of the situation in West Berlin.

The government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes such an agenda for the summit conference. However, it also pointed out that achievements can only be made in discussing German issues with the participation of German representatives. Fifteen years after the end of the Second World War and in the existence of the two Germanys, it is incompatible with the right to self-determination if the representatives of the German people cannot speak when discussing issues of vital importance to the German people.

We are confident that we will receive the support of all peace-loving people, including the Chinese people, on this issue.

The German Democratic Republic fully agrees with the opinion of the People's Republic of China that the time is now ripe to take effective measures in Asia to safeguard peace, to oppose the provocations of Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee and Ngo Dinh Diem, who are lackeys of imperialism and threaten peace, and to oppose the imperialist attempts to rely on the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to aggravate the tension in the Far East and Southeast Asia.

We support the sincere efforts made by the People's Republic of China, one of the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, to maintain the Bandung Conference principles as the basis of relations between countries, and to defend these principles against all conspiracies of reactionaries.

In the face of recent developments in Japan, we believe that the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Pacific region is urgently needed. This would be a valuable contribution to safeguarding peace in the Far East and Southeast Asia.

Dear comrades and friends!

We, these fraternal countries, embody a new, truly free social system, and our actions embody true historical progress. Our countries have contributed to peace and to the happiness of the people in the great family of socialist people.

I ask you to join me in raising a glass,

To the invincible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
To the unbreakable friendship between Germany and China,
To the great and powerful People's Republic of China and the heroic and industrious Chinese people,
To maintaining and consolidating world peace,
To the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
To the health of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China,
To the health of Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China,
To the health of Comrade Li Xiannian,
To the health of all the comrades and friends present,
Cheers!

### 在欢迎德意志民主共和国政府代表团宴会上　海因里希·劳副总理讲话

专栏：

    在欢迎德意志民主共和国政府代表团宴会上
    海因里希·劳副总理讲话敬爱的李先念副总理同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我们非常愉快地接受了我们远东的忠实而强大的同盟者中华人民共和国的邀请。
    我们深信，我们的访问也必将有助于进一步加深德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国之间亲密的友好关系。
    德意志民主共和国的人民怀着极大的兴趣和非常关切的心情注视着中华人民共和国飞跃发展的社会主义建设。德意志民主共和国劳动人民对中国人民在社会主义建设事业中已经获得的伟大成就和每天正在取得的新成就，对他们全面的大跃进运动表示十分赞扬和钦佩。这些成就同时将鼓舞我国人民为实现我国七年计划的伟大任务去作目标明确的努力。这个计划将使社会主义在德意志民主共和国取得胜利。
    兄弟的中国人民对德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设事业一贯给予伟大无私的援助，并且始终坚决地支持我们为争取同两个德国缔结和约、争取通过西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市来消除西柏林的危险温床所进行的斗争，即通过约制德国军国主义和帝国主义来保障欧洲和平的斗争。德意志民主共和国政府和人民对于中华人民共和国的这种伟大友谊，给予高度的评价。
    德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国之间的亲密合作和兄弟友谊将加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家伟大的兄弟联盟，增强那些正在为争取世界和平、民族独立和社会进步而进行斗争的一切力量。
    如果说，国际局势缓和的趋势今天比较强烈、资本主义国家重要人物愈来愈多地谈论苏联政府提出的全面彻底的裁军建议，那么，这首先是苏联和整个社会主义阵营一贯奉行和平政策的结果。这种和平政策由于社会主义各国在社会主义建设和共产主义建设中取得的伟大成就而正在发生愈来愈大的影响，从而使国际力量的对比继续朝着有利于爱好和平力量的方向变化。社会主义社会制度对资本主义社会制度的全面优越性，今天已经日益明显，现在反殖民主义的民族解放运动不仅已经席卷亚洲，而且也已经席卷非洲大陆和拉丁美洲各国人民。所有这一切都使得帝国主义势力——冷战和热战的势力——陷入绝路。甚至帝国主义各国政府也日益被迫在他们的政策中考虑各国人民对缓和紧张局势和不同社会制度国家和平共处的普遍愿望，如果他们不想在他们本国人民和全世界人民群众面前更加孤立的话。
    情况表明，帝国主义奉行反对各国人民利益的政策是愈来愈困难了。可是，今天西德的统治集团不愿意懂得这一点，而继续他们的冷战、原子武装和压迫一切民主力量的政策。他们今天最顽固地反对国际局势的任何缓和，因为他们害怕两个德国在德国土地上进行和平竞赛。
    西德帝国主义者企图以武力把他们的势力范围扩张到德意志民主共和国和欧洲的其它邻国。他们对亚非各国推行扩张主义和殖民主义政策，他们是国际局势缓和的敌人，并且用他们狂妄的计划最严重地威胁着和平。
    大家知道，西德政府断言波恩国家是全德的唯一合法代表。这种说法同爱好和平的德意志民主共和国和帝国主义的西德国家这两个德意志国家并存的现实，是十分矛盾的，并且将给予波恩政府一种国际法上的借口，来为他们侵略德意志民主共和国的意图进行辩解。波恩政府为了达到独霸的目的，企图用压力和粗暴地干涉其他国家内政的各种手段来阻止其他国家同德意志民主共和国建立正常的外交关系。但是，这些践踏其他国家主权的政策正在日益失去作用。很多国家的政府，特别是亚非国家的政府，日益认识到必须同两个德意志国家保持正常关系，以便有助于国际局势的缓和。这些国家的人民过去和现在都在进行反对帝国主义的艰苦斗争。同西德建立片面的外交关系只能有利于波恩扩张主义的战争企图，而违背他们本国人民和德意志人民的利益。
    德意志民主共和国所要求的同两个德国缔结和约和解决西柏林问题，是欧洲目前应当解决的最重要的任务，以便阻止西德帝国主义发动一次新的战争。现在应当最终结束已经停止了十五年之久的第二次世界大战，以便为一个统一的、真正民主和热爱和平的德意志国家创造前提条件。
    苏联为争取和平所作的不懈努力，特别是苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在美国进行重要访问所取得的成就，就是对举行一次最高级会议一事取得了谅解；这个会议今年5月就要在巴黎举行。在最高级会议上讨论的主要问题将是裁减军备、同两个德国缔结和约以及使西柏林局势正常化。
    德意志民主共和国政府欢迎最高级会议的这样一个议程。但是，它同时指出，只有在德国代表参加的情况下，讨论德国问题才能取得成就。在第二次世界大战结束了十五年以及存在着两个德意志国家的情况下，如果讨论德国人民切身问题的时候，德国人民的代表不能发言，这是和自决权不相容的。
    我们确信，我们将在这个问题上得到一切爱好和平的人民包括中国人民的支持。
    德意志民主共和国完全赞同中华人民共和国的意见，即现在时机已经成熟，应该在亚洲也采取有效措施来保障和平，反对帝国主义的仆从蒋介石、李承晚和吴庭艳威胁和平的挑衅，并反对帝国主义企图依靠东南亚条约组织加剧远东和东南亚的紧张局势。
    我们支持和平共处五项原则的创议者之一——中华人民共和国为维护万隆会议原则作为各国之间关系的基础，以及为保卫这些原则反对反动派的一切阴谋而作的真诚的努力。
    面对着最近日本局势的发展，我们认为急需实现在太平洋地区建立无原子武器地区的建议。这对于保障远东和东南亚的和平将是一个宝贵的贡献。
    亲爱的同志们、朋友们！
    我们这些兄弟国家体现了新的、真正自由的社会制度，而我们的行动体现了真正的历史进步。我们各国对于和平和对于社会主义人民大家庭中人民的幸福作出了贡献。
    我请大家和我一起举杯，
    为以苏联为首的不可战胜的社会主义阵营，
    为牢不可破的德中友谊，
    为伟大而强大的中华人民共和国和英勇、勤劳的中国人民，
    为维护和巩固世界和平，
    为中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志的健康，
    为中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志的健康，
    为中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志的健康，
    为李先念同志的健康，
    为所有在座的同志们和朋友们的健康，
    干杯！
