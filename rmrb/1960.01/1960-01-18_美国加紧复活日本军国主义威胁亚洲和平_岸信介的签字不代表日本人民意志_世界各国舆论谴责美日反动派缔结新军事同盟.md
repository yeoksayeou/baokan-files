Xinhua News Agency, January 16th: TASS Moscow, January 15th: TASS commentator Kharikov writes: The new U.S.-Japan military treaty that Kishi Nobusuke went to Washington to sign will create a serious danger of dragging Japan into armed conflict. The treaty stipulates that the Japanese army should ensure the security of U.S. bases. In this way, Japan may be dragged into military conflict against its will. One cannot but agree with the view of "Yomiuri Shimbun" that the new treaty may create a situation that will be used by the United States to launch military actions with Japan's participation. Thus, the new treaty will not only fail to guarantee Japan's security but will actually expose it to a real threat.

The commentary said that the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty that Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke is preparing to sign in Washington is not promoting peace in Asia but creating a threat to Asia. It will allow Japan's militarist forces to run rampant and intensify the country's militarization. It will complicate Japan's relations with its neighbors, whose public opinion is vigilantly watching the dangerous tricks of Japanese militarists.

The commentary pointed out that just as the world is moving along the path of easing tensions, the Japanese ruling clique is trying to drag Japan onto a completely opposite path.

The commentary said that the actions of the Japanese ruling clique, which is eager to engage in military collusion with the United States, are contrary to the national interests of the Japanese people. The uneasiness felt by Japanese public opinion is entirely understandable, as they regard the new treaty with the United States as a stone pressing on the neck of national independence.

Currently, Japan is at a crucial juncture. The people, who urgently hope that the country will not be dragged into military adventures, demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government abandon its alliance with the United States and pursue a neutral policy. This demand should not be ignored. The Japanese people have the sympathy of all peace-loving people in their courageous struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 14th: "Soviet Navy News" today published an article condemning Kishi Nobusuke for going to the United States to sign a new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The "Soviet Navy News" article pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's trip was not for the relaxation of tensions but to conduct negotiations on strengthening the U.S.-Japan military alliance. The new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" will further increase Japan's military, political, and economic dependence on the United States, and expand Japan's military power under the treaty. This policy of the Kishi government has aroused the anger of the Japanese people, but the ruling group in Tokyo, disregarding the will of the people, decided to sign the new "Security Treaty" and accelerate Japan's armament.

The article concluded by saying that the program of reviving Japanese militarism with the direct support of Washington, and the activities of the Kishi government for months to revise the "Security Treaty," have aroused active protests from the Japanese people. The Japanese people are confidently opposing the subordination of their motherland to the interests of the Pentagon.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 13th: "Soviet Russia Daily" today published an article commenting on Kishi Nobusuke's shameful act of going to Washington to sign the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," saying that Kishi Nobusuke's signature does not represent the will of the Japanese people, because the vast majority of the Japanese people regard Kishi Nobusuke's action as a shameful action aimed at intensifying international tensions and pushing Japan onto the dangerous road of an arms race.

The article said that the current purpose of the Japanese ruling clique is to maintain the atmosphere of the darkest days of the "Cold War," which is obvious. The article pointed out that the face of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is even more ugly, because after the treaty is signed, Japan will be forced to pay its own price for the military adventures of U.S. imperialism in the Far East. As for the political purpose of this new U.S.-Japan treaty, it is clear that it is to make Japan a cannon fodder and a military springboard for U.S. imperialism in the Far East.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 15th: "Democratic Korea Daily" today published a commentary saying that the conclusion of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," which will destroy the Japanese nation and threaten peace in the Far East and Asia, must not be allowed.

The commentary said that the conclusion of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" shows that the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to form a "Northeast Asia Alliance" by gathering the Li Chengwan, Chiang Kai-shek, and Philippine groups with the revived militarist Japan as the core has been further deepened and materialized.

The commentary said, "U.S. imperialism, because its policy of aggression and expansion has been severely hit by the world's peace forces and is in a particularly isolated and difficult situation, in order to restore its completely bankrupt 'military superiority' and to achieve its aggressive ambitions, has recently repeatedly talked about 'peace' to deceive the people, but in reality, it is plotting to expand its armaments and prepare for war."

The commentary pointed out that if the U.S. ruling clique, through the conclusion of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," drags Japan into its war of aggression against Asia and makes Japan return to the path of war and aggression, it is very clear what kind of fate Japan will be in.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 14th: Today's "Red Rights Daily" pointed out in a commentary that the preparation to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is a "Cold War" action and a threat to security and peace in the Far East.

The commentary emphasized that the new treaty will increasingly and disturbingly turn Japan into a U.S. atomic bomb base.

The commentary said that in view of the fact that the United States has been linked with the Philippines, the Chiang Kai-shek group, and South Korea through the conclusion of military treaties, the revised U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" will make the interconnected military treaties perfect, thus laying the foundation for the formation of a Northeast Asia Treaty Organization. The newspaper warned that this fact will obviously worsen the entire situation in that region of the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 15th: Hungarian "People's Freedom Daily" pointed out in a commentary on January 15th regarding Japan's imminent signing of a new military treaty with the United States that the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," which was signed in 1951 during the U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea, further clears the obstacles to the rapid armament of Japan, which makes the Washington Cold War group very happy. The United States will still have the right to station troops and maintain military bases in Japan, and even when necessary, Japan is obliged to defend the U.S. military. Kishi Nobusuke also claimed that "Japan's armed forces can be sent abroad" and "attack enemy bases."

The commentary emphasized that the new "Security Treaty" obliges Japan to send troops abroad to fight alongside U.S. troops when necessary.

The commentary went on to say that the "Security Treaty" will not only make Japan participate in military adventures, but also militarization, the growth of armed forces, and the equipment of nuclear weapons will cause a serious burden on Japan's economy. The large increase in military spending will inevitably reduce the living standards of the Japanese working people.

The commentary said that strengthening armament preparations will make Japanese big capitalists rich, and Japanese trusts that produce weapons will prosper again and implement the old militarist policies. The interests of Japanese big capitalists are consistent with the interests of the U.S. believers who undermine the relaxation of the international situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, January 14th: Lebanese "Call of the People" published an article today saying that the Japanese ruling clique, headed by Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke, revised the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" "to tie Japan more tightly than in the past to the chariot of U.S. policy and to fill Japanese territory with U.S. military bases."

The article pointed out that U.S. imperialism has built military bases and rocket bases in Japan. The article also said that, therefore, the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" will make Japan further succumb to the United States and put Japan on the dangerous road that the Japanese people are worried about.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, January 17th: The Iraqi "National Daily" today commented on Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's trip to the United States to sign the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," saying that the Japanese people will not remain silent on this treaty because it "will not only put them in shackles and subordinate them to the United States, but will also make them targets for complete destruction in any war that the United States may provoke under this or that pretext." The newspaper expressed its belief that the Japanese people will certainly defeat their enemies and imperialists because they have the support of the people of all countries.

    美国加紧复活日本军国主义威胁亚洲和平
    岸信介的签字不代表日本人民意志
    世界各国舆论谴责美日反动派缔结新军事同盟
  据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：塔斯社评论员哈里科夫写道：岸信介到华盛顿去签字的新的美日军事条约，将造成把日本拖入武装冲突的严重危险。条约规定日本军队应该保障美国基地的安全。这样日本有可能违背它的意志，而被拖入军事冲突中去。不能不同意“读卖新闻”的这种看法，即：新的条约可能造成这样一种局面，这种局面将被美国用来发动有日本参加的军事行动。这样，新的条约不但不能保障日本的安全，反而会使它面临真正的威胁。
    评论说，岸信介首相准备在华盛顿签定的美日军事同盟条约不是促进亚洲的和平，而是给亚洲制造威胁。它将使日本的军国主义势力猖獗起来，加剧国家的军国主义化。它将使日本同邻国之间的关系复杂化，这些邻国的社会舆论正在警惕地注视着日本军国主义者的危险把戏。
    评论指出，正当世界沿着缓和紧张局势的道路前进的时候，日本统治集团却想把日本拖上完全相反的道路。
    评论说，急于同美国进行军事勾结的日本统治集团的行为是违背日本人民的民族利益的。日本公众舆论所感到的不安是完全可以理解的，他们把同美国签订的新条约看做是压在国家民族独立的脖子上的石头。
    目前，日本正处于一个决定性的关头。迫切希望不要把国家拖入军事冒险的人民，要求岸信介政府放弃同美国的同盟并奉行中立政策。对这个要求不应该置之不理。日本人民在他们勇敢的斗争中得到一切爱好和平的人们的同情。
    据新华社莫斯科14日电　“苏联海军报”今天发表文章，谴责岸信介去美国签订新的日美“安全条约”。
    “苏联海军报”的文章指出，岸信介此行不是为了紧张局势的缓和，而是去进行关于加强美日军事同盟的谈判。新的日美“安全条约”，将更进一步使日本的军事、政治和经济依赖于美国，并根据条约来扩充日本的军事力量。岸政府的这种政策已引起了日本人民的愤怒，但东京统治集团不顾人民的意志决定签订新的“安全条约”，加速日本的武装。
    文章最后说，在华盛顿直接支持下的复活日本军国主义的纲领以及几个月来岸政府为修改“安全条约”进行的活动，引起了日本人民的积极抗议。日本人民充满信心地在反对把自己祖国从属于五角大楼的利益。
    据新华社莫斯科13日电　“苏维埃俄罗斯报”今天发表文章，评论岸信介即将去华盛顿在新的日美“安全条约”上签字的可耻行为说，岸信介的签字决不代表日本人民的意志，因为绝大多数的日本人民都把岸信介的这个行动看作是目的在于加剧国际紧张局势、把日本推上军备竞赛的危险道路的可耻行动。
    文章说，日本统治集团目前的目的是要保持“冷战”最阴暗日子里的气氛，这是显而易见的。文章指出，新的日美“安全条约”的面目是更加丑恶的，因为这个条约签字后日本就将被迫对美帝国主义在远东的军事冒险付出自己的代价。至于这个新的日美条约的政治目的，很显然它是要使日本成为美帝国主义在远东的炮灰和军事跳板。
    据新华社平壤15日电“民主朝鲜报”今天发表评论说，决不能容许缔结毁灭日本民族、威胁远东和亚洲和平的新的日美“安全条约”。
    评论说，新的日美“安全条约”的缔结，说明美帝国主义企图以复活了军国主义的日本为核心，纠集李承晚、蒋介石集团和菲律宾组成“东北亚同盟”的勾当进一步深入和具体化了。
    评论说，“美帝国主义由于它的侵略和扩张政策受到世界和平力量的沉重打击而陷于特别孤立和困难的处境，为了恢复彻底破产了的‘军事优势’，为了达到侵略野心，最近一再侈谈‘和平’欺骗人民，而实际上却在阴谋策划扩充军备和进行战争准备。”
    评论指出，如果美国统治集团通过缔结新的日美“安全条约”，把日本拉入它的侵略亚洲的战争，使日本重新走战争和侵略的道路，日本将处于什么样的命运是十分清楚的。
    据新华社布拉格14日电　今天的“红色权利报”在一篇评论中指出，准备修改日美“安全条约”是一个“冷战”行动，并且是对远东的安全与和平的威胁。
    评论着重指出，新的条约将愈来愈令人不安地把日本变为美国的原子弹基地。
    评论说，鉴于美国通过缔结军事条约已同菲律宾、蒋介石集团和南朝鲜联在一起，修改后的日美“安全条约”将使相互联结的军事条约趋于完备，从而为结成东北亚条约组织奠定基础。报纸警告说，这一事实将会使世界那一地区的整个形势明显地恶化。
    据新华社布达佩斯15日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”15日就日本同美国即将签署新的军事条约发表的评论指出，1951年美帝国主义侵略朝鲜时期所签订的日美“安全条约”的修改，进一步扫除了迅速武装日本的障碍，这使华盛顿冷战集团非常欢心。美国今后仍然有权在日本驻军和保留军事基地，甚至在必要的时候日本有义务来保卫美国军队。岸信介并声称，“日本的武装力量可以派出到国外”，“向敌人的基地进攻”。
    评论强调说，新的“安全条约”责成日本在必要的时候派军队到国外同美国军队共同作战。
    评论接着说，“安全条约”不仅将使日本参加军事冒险，而且，军国主义化、武装力量的增长、核武器装备都将给日本的经济造成严重的负担，军事开支的大量增长，必然降低日本劳动人民的生活水平。
    评论说，加强武装准备将使日本大资本家发财，生产武器的日本托辣斯又将繁荣起来并实行老军国主义政策。日本大资本家的利益是同破坏国际局势缓和的美国信徒的利益相一致的。
    新华社贝鲁特14日电　黎巴嫩“呼声报”今天发表文章说，以岸信介首相为首的日本统治集团修改日美“安全条约”，“目的在于把日本比过去更紧地绑在美国政策的战车上，使日本领土上满布美国军事基地”。
    文章指出，美帝国主义已在日本建筑了军事基地和火箭基地。文章还说，因此，修改日美“安全条约”将使日本进一步屈从美国，使日本走上日本人民所担心的危险道路。
    新华社巴格达17日电　伊拉克“国家报”今天就日本首相岸信介去美国签订新的日美“安全条约”发表评论说，日本人民不会对这项条约保持沉默，因为它“不仅将使他们套上枷锁，使他们从属于美国，而且将使他们成为在美国可能以这种或那种借口挑起来的任何战争中被完全毁灭的目标。”这家报纸表示相信，日本人民一定会击败他们的敌人和帝国主义者，因为他们有各国人民的支持。
