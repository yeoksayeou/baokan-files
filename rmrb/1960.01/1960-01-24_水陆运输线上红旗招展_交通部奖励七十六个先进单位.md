Xinhua News Agency report: The Ministry of Communications awarded seventy-six red flags to commend advanced units in the national transportation sector for their outstanding work achievements in 1959.

The campaign for increased production and conservation in the transportation sector witnessed new developments and significant achievements in 1959, whether in road transport, water transport, or civil aviation. In the road transport sector, the competition for "safety, economy, and ten thousand ton-kilometers per ton of vehicle capacity per month" was widely and deeply promoted. According to statistics from eighteen provinces and regions, the output of freight vehicles in December 1959 increased by 74% compared to before the competition, achieving a large-scale bumper harvest. Automobile transportation enterprises in three provinces and thirty-one special districts nationwide achieved the high-yield target of ten thousand ton-kilometers per ton of vehicle capacity per month. At the same time, the quality of motor transport and cargo handling rate were greatly improved, fuel consumption was significantly reduced, and maintenance of highways and vehicles progressed considerably. During the competition, the multi-shift system for drivers and the use of road trains were widely promoted across the country, and in many areas, one vehicle was effectively doing the work of two. The focus of the competition in the water transport sector was to achieve safety, economy, high quality, and the "1-5-5-1" transportation targets, namely, river tugboats reaching 15,000 ton-kilometers per horsepower per month, coastal freighters reaching 5,000 ton-kilometers per ton of vessel capacity per month, and wooden sailboats reaching 1,000 ton-kilometers per ton of vessel capacity per month. After the launch of this competition, water transport efficiency greatly improved. In December 1959, the navigation rate of coastal trunk line vessels increased by 37% compared to July, and many coastal freighters achieved high production records. In civil aviation, a "Six Goods" competition (ensuring safety, increasing production and practicing thrift, good service quality, good technological innovation and revolution, good political thought, and good implementation of the Red and Expert plan) with safe production as the guideline was launched. Both transport aviation, specialized aviation, and aircraft repair enterprises ensured flight safety and significantly improved production efficiency. During these vigorous competitions, transportation departments in various regions created and promoted the advanced experience of the "one-dragon" transportation collaboration of production, transportation, and sales. This was an outstanding innovation in management work in transportation enterprises in 1959.

The seventy-six advanced units awarded include transportation bureaus of ten provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions such as Guangdong, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Hebei, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Guangxi, Shanghai, and Fujian, and sixty-six transportation agencies and enterprises in special districts and counties. These units were all creators of large-scale, high-yield records in the increased production and conservation red flag competition, and each had outstanding achievements.

In Guangdong Province, the mass movement for short-distance transportation resulted in a straight upward trend. Transportation workers in Henan, Shandong, and Zhejiang provinces overcame difficulties such as rain, fog, ice, and snow, and successively achieved the large-scale bumper harvest target of "safety, economy, and ten thousand ton-kilometers per ton of vehicle capacity per month" in December 1959. Jiangsu Province is an advanced unit in water transportation. The Hebei Province transportation department vigorously promoted a spirit of cooperation and widely established "one-dragon" cooperative transportation lines throughout the province, greatly improving transportation efficiency. Many key factories and mines achieved track-laying and cable-laying for transportation, mechanization of loading and unloading, and mechanization of earthwork, and ensured smooth roads in factory and mining areas, changing the backwardness of short-distance transportation in factories and mines.

Sichuan Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region achieved great success in transportation construction. At the awarding ceremony, the head of the Ministry of Communications called on workers on the national transportation front to hold even higher the red flag of the General Line in 1960, and continue to comprehensively, deeply, and widely promote the increased production and conservation red flag competition centered on technological innovation and revolution, and the mass movement for short-distance transportation, to support the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in the new year.

    水陆运输线上红旗招展
    交通部奖励七十六个先进单位
    据新华社讯　交通部颁发了七十六面红旗，奖励全国交通运输部门在1959年内工作成绩卓著的先进单位。
    交通运输部门的增产节约红旗竞赛运动，无论是在公路运输、水上运输或民用航空部门，在1959年都有许多新的发展和巨大成就。公路运输部门，广泛、深入地开展了“安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里”的竞赛，据十八个省、区的统计，1959年12月份货运汽车的车吨月产量，比竞赛开展以前提高了74％，获得了大面积丰收；全国有三个省和三十一个专区的汽车运输企业，实现了车吨月产万吨公里的高产指标。与此同时，汽车运输的质量和货物装卸率大大提高，燃料消耗大量降低，公路和汽车的保养维修工作也有很大进步。在竞赛运动中，全国各地普遍推广了驾驶多班制度和汽车列车化，许多地区已经做到了一辆汽车顶两辆用。水上运输部门开展竞赛的中心内容是：实现安全、节约、优质和“一五、五、一”的运输目标，即江河的拖轮达到每马力月产一万五千吨公里，江海的货轮达到船吨月产五千吨公里，木帆船达到船吨月产一千吨公里。这个竞赛开展以后，水上运输效率大大提高，1959年12月份，江海干线船舶的航行率比7月份提高了37％，许多江海货船纷纷创造了高产纪录。在民用航空方面，开展了以安全生产为纲的“六好”（即保证安全好、增产节约好、服务质量好、技术革新和技术革命开展得好、政治思想好、执行红专规划好）竞赛，无论是运输航空、专业航空和飞机修理企业，都保证了飞行安全，生产效率显著提高。在这些轰轰烈烈地竞赛运动中，各地交通运输部门创造和推广了产、运、销“一条龙”运输大协作的先进经验，这是1959年交通运输企业在管理工作上的一项突出的创举。
    获得奖励的七十六个先进单位，有广东，河南，山东，江苏，河北，浙江，四川，广西，上海，福建等十个省、市、自治区的交通厅（局）和六十六个专区及县的交通运输机关和企业。这些单位都是增产节约红旗竞赛运动中，大面积高额丰产纪录的创造者，各有突出的成就。
    广东省在开展短途运输群众运动中，短途运输是直线上升。河南、山东、浙江三省的交通运输职工，战胜了雨雾冰雪等困难，在1959年12月先后实现了“安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里”的大面积丰产指标。江苏省是水上运输的先进单位。河北省交通运输部门大兴协作之风，在全省普遍建立了“一条龙”协作运输线，大大提高了运输效率；许多重点厂矿做到了搬运轨道化、索道化，装卸机械化、土机械化，厂区矿区道路畅通，改变了厂矿短途运输的落后面貌。
    四川省和广西僮族自治区的交通建设很有成绩。交通部负责人在为授旗举行的大会上，号召全国交通运输战线上的职工，在1960年更高地举起总路线的红旗，继续全面、深入、广泛地开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约红旗竞赛运动和短途运输的群众运动，支援工农业生产在新的一年继续跃进。
