Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 9th: To enhance cooperation and mutual understanding between Albania and other Balkan countries, the Balkan Countries Cooperation and Understanding Committee was established in Tirana on the 8th.

    This committee, established at the initiative of various people's organizations, consists of twenty-three well-known activists from all walks of life. Harito was elected as the chairman of the committee.

    At the inaugural meeting, Harito said, "We believe that the establishment of this committee will enhance cooperation and friendly relations between neighboring countries." He pointed out that although the Albanian government has repeatedly proposed establishing good neighborly relations with Greece, it has not been understood by the Royal Government of Athens. At the same time, the Greek and Turkish governments have also adopted a negative stance towards the proposal made by Romanian Council of Ministers Chairman Chivu Stoica to convene a Balkan countries conference and conclude a treaty of friendship and cooperation.

    Harito said that Albania firmly protests against the measures taken by the Italian and Greek governments to allow the establishment of atomic weapons and missile bases on their territories. He also said that the Albanian people unreservedly support the Soviet proposal to transform the Balkans and Adriatic Sea region into a nuclear-weapon-free and missile-free zone of peace.

    阿尔巴尼亚坚持睦邻政策
    成立巴尔干国家合作和谅解委员会以增进合作
    新华社地拉那9日电　为了增进阿尔巴尼亚和巴尔干各国之间的合作和相互了解，8日在地拉那成立了巴尔干国家合作和谅解委员会。
    这个在各人民团体的倡议下成立的委员会，由二十三名各界知名活动家所组成，哈里托当选为委员会主席。
    哈里托在成立大会上说，我们相信，成立这一委员会将增进邻国之间的合作和友好关系。他指出，虽然阿尔巴尼亚政府一再倡议同希腊建立睦邻关系，但是没有得到雅典王国政府的谅解。同时，希腊和土耳其政府对罗马尼亚部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡提出的召开巴尔干国家会议并缔结一个友好和合作条约的建议，也采取了否定的立场。
    哈里托说，阿尔巴尼亚坚决抗议意大利和希腊政府为允许在自己的领土上建立原子武器和导弹基地所采取的措施。他并且说，阿尔巴尼亚人民无保留地支持苏联提出的将巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区变成无原子武器和无火箭的和平地区的建议。
