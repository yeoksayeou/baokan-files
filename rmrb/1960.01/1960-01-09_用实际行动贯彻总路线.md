    New Year's Aspirations
    The Party and the state have created conditions for our generation of young people to fully display their intelligence and talents. I deeply feel happy and proud to be born in such an era. Brothers and sisters on all fronts of the motherland have made ambitious plans to create miracles in 1960. The great cause of the Party and the beautiful prospects of the motherland, as well as the inspiring deeds I see everywhere, make me realize that my past work was only a drop in the ocean of our country's huge construction tide. I vow to be a true revolutionary and to make the Party's cause my lifelong goal. In the past, I have not worked hard enough. In the new year, I will rely more closely on the Party, listen to the Party's words, continuously improve my political awareness, establish a firm revolutionary outlook on life, and arm myself with the thought of continuous revolution. I will always be with my comrades, learn with humility, ensure the high-speed and high-quality completion of all design tasks assigned to me by the Party, and strive to overfulfill my personal work plan by 15%. I will use practical actions to implement the Party's general line, contribute my little strength to the prosperity of the motherland and the happiness of mankind, and march forward boldly along the road pointed out by the Party forever.

    用实际行动贯彻总路线
    党和国家为我们这一代青年人创造了充分发挥聪明才智的
  条件，我深为自己能生长在这样一个时代而感到幸福与自豪。祖国各个战线上的兄弟姐妹们都立下了凌云壮志，要在1960年大创奇迹。党的伟大事业和祖国美好的前景，以及我到处看到的振奋人心的事迹，使我认识到过去自己的工作在我国巨大的建设洪流里，仅仅是苍海中的一粟。我立誓要当一个真正的革命者，要以党的事业作为自己终身奋斗的目标。过去，我工作得还不够，在新的一年内，我要更加紧紧地依靠党，听党的话，不断提高政治觉悟，树立坚定的革命人生观，以不断革命的思想武装自己。要永远和同志们在一起，虚心学习，保证高速优质地完成党交给我的一切设计任务，并力争超额15％完成个人作业计划，用实际行动贯彻执行党的总路线，为祖国的富强、人类的幸福尽自己的一点力量，沿着党所指引的道路永远大踏步前进。
