Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 9th – To achieve daily increases, transportation must come first. Party secretaries at all levels in Hebei Province personally took charge, mobilizing workers in the province's transportation departments to launch a "More Transportation, Guarantee High Production" competition, transporting sufficient "supplies" for daily increases in industrial production. In recent days, from land to water, from rail to road, vehicles and ships loaded with coal, ore, timber, and other materials have been flowing day and night. From January 1st to 6th, the average daily freight volume of railways and highways in the province increased by 8.1% and 20.55% respectively, compared to the average daily freight volume in December last year.

The workers on the industrial front in Hebei Province began a cross-year, large-scale high-yield competition at the end of last year, which has made the production level rise steadily, and the number of raw materials required has increased daily. In order to ensure the sufficient supply of raw materials and fuels needed for industrial production, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, local party committees, and the party committees of larger factories and mines have all had a secretary in charge, leading transportation department workers in launching the "More Transportation, Guarantee High Production" competition. Transportation coordination offices have been established in various places, unifying the deployment of transportation forces according to the principle of ensuring key projects and taking care of general needs, organizing rational transportation, and giving full play to transportation potential.

In the "More Transportation, Guarantee High Production" competition, workers in various transportation departments focused on the loading and unloading link, launching a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the realization of mechanized and semi-mechanized loading and unloading. From the end of December last year to the present, they have put forward more than 10,000 innovation suggestions, and manufactured 40 types of simple loading and unloading machinery, such as transmission machines, grab-bucket bulk spreaders, and cranes, totaling more than 500 units, which have increased loading and unloading efficiency by more than one time. Workers of the Shijiazhuang City Transportation Company adopted the method of self-reliance and combining indigenous and foreign methods to create and transform more than 200 types of loading and unloading machinery, increasing loading and unloading efficiency by one to eight times. Due to the increased degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading in various stations and freight yards throughout the province, the average loading and unloading efficiency from January 1st to 6th increased by 7% to 11% compared to December last year, greatly shortening the stay time of vehicles in stations (yards).

Currently, mass water transportation and icebreaking navigation are also being carried out in various parts of Hebei Province. By the 7th, more than 2,000 kilometers of natural ice roads and artificial ice roads have been opened up in the cold northern regions such as Zhangjiakou and Chengde, and more than 47,000 various ice beds and sleds have been repaired and newly built, increasing the province's transportation capacity by more than 200,000 tons per day. In areas with warmer climates, such as Tianjin, Baoding, Handan, and Shijiazhuang, the masses are organized to break the ice and navigate the main rivers, making navigation on the Haihe River, the Grand Canal, and other main rivers unobstructed.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 9th – In Xiuning County, Anhui Province, which is mostly mountainous, the method of short-distance relay transportation has been widely promoted, basically eliminating the long-term backlog of mountain tea, bamboo, medicinal materials, bamboo shoots, charcoal, and various wild plants that can be used as industrial raw materials.

The short-distance relay transportation method is simple and easy to implement. The specific method is to change long-distance transportation of dozens or hundreds of miles into stations every five, ten, or fifteen miles, depending on the distribution of mountain villages along the way. Each station is responsible for receiving and dispatching goods by the local commercial grass-roots units. The people's communes organize commune members to relay transport station by station according to the source of goods.

This transportation method has many advantages. First of all, it does not affect normal agricultural production. Because the transportation distance is very short, one trip can be transported by taking advantage of the break in the evening or about two hours after dinner. Because the transportation is short and does not take much time, the people participating in the transportation do not have to be strong laborers. The whole and half laborers can do what they can, and even the commune cadres can participate.

This method also brings in various daily necessities and means of production, ensuring the supply of commodities in mountain villages.

### 革新装卸搬运技术　开展水上运输和破冰通航  河北多运输保高产竞赛丰收  休宁推行短途接力运输让物资很快下山

    革新装卸搬运技术　开展水上运输和破冰通航
    河北多运输保高产竞赛丰收
    休宁推行短途接力运输让物资很快下山
    新华社天津9日电　要得日日红，运输必先行。河北省各级党委书记亲自挂帅，发动全省运输部门的职工，开展“多运保高产”竞赛，为工业生产日日红运送足够的“粮草”。连日来，全省从旱路到水路，从铁路到公路，满载煤炭、矿石、木材等物资的车辆、船只，昼夜川流不息。1月1  日到6日，全省铁路和公路的平均日运量，分别比去年12月的平均日运量  增加8．1％和20．55％。
    河北省工业战线上的职工，从去年底开始展开跨年度大面积高产竞赛，使生产水平蒸蒸日上，需要的原料材料数量逐日增加。为了保证工业生产所需原料、燃料的充分供应，中共河北省委、各地委和较大厂矿企业的党委，都有一名书记挂帅，领导运输部门职工开展“多运保高产”竞赛。各地成立了运输协作办公室，按照保证重点、照顾一般的原则，统一调度运输力量，组织合理运输，发挥了运输潜力。
    各运输部门的职工在多运保高产竞赛中，围绕着装卸搬运这个环节，开展了以实现装卸机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，从去年12月底到现在，共提出了一万多条革新建议，制造出传动机、蟹爪散装机、起重吊车等四十种共五百多台简易装卸机械，使装卸效率提高一倍以上。石家庄市搬运公司职工，采取自力更生、土洋结合的方法，创造和改造装卸机械二百多种，提高了装卸效率一至八倍。全省各车站、货场由于装卸机械化、半机械化程度提高，1日至6日的平均装卸效率比去年12月份提高了7％到11％，大大缩短了车辆在站（场）停留时间。
    河北省各地目前还开展群众性的水上运输和破冰通航。到7日止，张家口、承德等北部寒冷地区，已开辟自然冰道和人造冰道两千多公里，整修和新造各种冰床、爬犁四万七千多只，使全省每天增加二十多万吨的运输能力。天津、保定、邯郸、石家庄等气候较暖地区，组织群众在主要河流破冰通航，使海河、运河等主要河流的航运畅行无阻。
    新华社合肥9日电　多山的安徽省休宁县，普遍推行短途接力运输办法，基本上消除了山区茶叶、竹木、药材、竹笋、木炭以及各种可作为工业原料的野生植物长期积压的现象。
    短途接力运输办法简而易行。具体做法是，把几十里、百把里的长途运输，根据沿途山村分布情况，改成五里、十里或十五里为一站，各站都由当地商业基层单位负责接收和发运货物。人民公社根据货源情况，组织社员一站站地接运。
    这种运输办法有很多好处。首先是不影响正常农业生产。因为运输路程很短，利用傍晚歇工或晚饭后两个小时左右，就可以运送一趟。因为运程短、花的时间不长，参加运输的人也不必非要强壮劳动力不可，整半劳动力都可以量力而行，连社干部也可以参加。
    这种办法还带进各种生活用品和生产资料，保证了山村商品的供应。
