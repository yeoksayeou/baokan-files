Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th -- Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory milling worker Wei Gaohou has pushed the limits of time even further. In the week from January 1st to 7th, he implemented a total of twenty-two innovation proposals. Calculated by work hours, this is equivalent to completing three years and twenty-three days of work, and also saved a significant amount of steel.

On New Year's Day, Wei Gaohou innovated twelve technologies and completed a year and two days' worth of work. On that day, Wei Gaohou changed the milling of gear racks from a single cutter to a double cutter, and from single piece to double piece, greatly improving efficiency, but he was not satisfied. He believes that tapping production potential requires digging deeper and deeper, and that one machine should be used as three. Therefore, he improved the fixture, increasing the number of clamped workpieces from two to five. As a result, he can complete twenty-four pieces a day, and the quality has also greatly improved.

Wei Gaohou not only focused on his own machine but also sought improvements in other workshops. When he was working on the precision casting die cover for the seventh workshop, he found that the workshop's automotive automatic screw shims were being hammered by hand, with only twenty pieces being made per shift. He immediately suggested switching to stamping and immediately helped to create the stamping die. As a result, work efficiency increased more than nine hundred times.

In the battle for a red-hot start, Wei Gaohou not only made himself red but also did everything possible to actively help those around him achieve a red-hot start. Drill operator Li Zhenmo in the same workshop used ordinary drill bits in the past. Wei Gaohou taught him the drill bit experience created by Li Fuxiang of Shanghai, which he learned in Beijing. The characteristic of this drill bit is that it has more blades, deeper cutting depth, and faster cutting speed, immediately increasing work efficiency tenfold. He also helped Tian Defang in the group master the advanced method of double-cutter milling nuts, increasing work efficiency by one time. Thanks to his enthusiastic help, the thirteen advanced experiences he brought back from the National Hero Conference have been mastered by more than thirty people.

### 实现二十二项革新　一挖再挖生产潜力  魏高厚七天完成三年工作量  传授先进经验带动周围职工开门红

    实现二十二项革新　一挖再挖生产潜力
    魏高厚七天完成三年工作量
    传授先进经验带动周围职工开门红
    新华社重庆9日电　重庆长安机器厂铣工魏高厚把时间往后甩得更远了。他在1月1日到7日的一周之内，共实现了革新建议二十二项，按工时计算已经完成了相当于三年零二十三天的工作量，并且节约了大量钢材。
    魏高厚在元旦那天就革新了十二项技术，完成了一年零两天的工作量。元旦那天魏高厚把铣齿条由单刀改为双刀，单件改为双件之后，效率提高很多，但他并不因此满足。他认为挖掘生产潜力要一挖再挖，要一部机器当三部用才行。于是，他又改进夹具，由夹活两件提高到五件。这样一来，一天就可做完二十四件，质量也大大提高。
    魏高厚不仅在自己机床上打主意，而且还在别的车间找改进。他在七车间搞精密铸造元车卡罩的时候，发现车间担任的汽车自动螺丝填片用手敲，一班只能作二十件。他立即建议改为冲压，并且立即帮助搞冲模。结果，工效提高九百多倍。
    魏高厚在开门红战斗中，不仅做到自己红，而且还想尽一切办法积极地帮助周围的人达到开门红。同车间钻工李振模过去用的是普通钻头，魏高厚把在北京学到的上海李福祥创造的钻头经验教给他。这种钻头的特点是刃多，进刀量深，切削快，一下提高工效十倍。他还帮助小组的田德芳掌握了双刀铣螺帽的先进方法，提高工效一倍。由于他的热忱帮助，从全国群英会上带回的十三项先进经验已经为三十多人所掌握。
