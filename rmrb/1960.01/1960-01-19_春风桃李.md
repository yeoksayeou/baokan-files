　　Spring Breeze and Peach Blossoms
　　Ma Shaobo

　　Chinese opera art has a long history. Talents are constantly being renewed, and the younger generation is always inheriting the art of their predecessors, carrying forward the tradition, and creating new traditions. This is an unwavering direction and an objective law of development.

　　In the ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the brilliant illumination of the Party and Chairman Mao's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," the flourishing development of opera art and the vigorous growth of new forces have marked a new life for Chinese opera. The changes in all aspects of the opera world have been enormous in the past ten years, and the new development of teacher-student relationships in the new society is an important aspect of this change.

　　In the past ten years, many veteran opera artists across the country have been patiently nurturing seedlings like diligent gardeners. When they cultivate the new generation, they do not do so with an individualistic attitude, but from the long-term interests of the people's drama cause. They unify the youth and future of a genre of art with the youth and future of the motherland, and unify personal interests with the interests of the socialist and communist cause.

　　In the old society, the practice of "apprenticeship" in the opera world had a long history and played a positive role in the inheritance and development of art. However, it is undeniable that many of the teacher-student relationships at that time were based on individualistic thinking, with a strong feudal character or influenced by certain bourgeois ideas. The so-called "teacher and disciple are like father and son" was essentially each for himself. Of course, there were also examples of respecting teachers and cherishing students in the old society, but there were also many cases where it was merely a formality. Students lacked sincerity and were unwilling to study hard, or presented a "disciple card" and did not study at all, or learned only a little bit to embellish themselves, just to borrow the name to flaunt themselves; teachers were also unwilling to teach seriously, or taught but were unwilling to impart all their knowledge, some preferring that the art should die out with them rather than teach apprentices. This could not but have a negative impact on the development of opera art.

　　Today's progress in teacher-student relationships is precisely manifested in gradually overcoming these negative influences, carrying forward its positive role, and truly achieving respect for teachers and cherishing students. Because the new teacher-student relationship is based on socialist and communist ideology, they are not only teachers and students, but also revolutionary comrades, with common political ideals and a consistent goal: to contribute their strength to a more brilliant future for opera art, to socialist construction, and to the further realization of communism. Thus, the teaching is energetic, and the learning is earnest.

　　The teaching relationship does not lie in whether or not there is a formal "apprenticeship." The teaching among actors in a troupe, the guidance of professional troupes to amateur troupes, and the teaching of teachers in opera schools are all carried out without holding an apprenticeship ceremony. Aren't the teachers teaching seriously and the students learning attentively? They are not doing it for personal gain, but for the development and promotion of opera art, and to better serve the people. This is the most reliable ideological foundation. Apprenticeship, determining status, is sometimes necessary, but this is only one of the ways to establish a teaching relationship, not the only way.

　　As long as a teaching relationship is established, students must learn respectfully and honestly, not be easily satisfied with a little knowledge, and only scratch the surface; at the same time, they must gradually create and develop on a certain foundation; teachers must not only teach, but also learn. We must encourage the students' creative spirit and can also learn a lot from the students, especially the young people's political ambition and vigorous spirit in their work. As the saying goes, "Teaching and learning promote each other," which has a profound meaning.

　　There is a famous saying in the opera world: "Art has no constant teacher." This certainly does not mean learning without focus; but it means not being bound or limited by the artistic achievements of one teacher, but drawing on the strengths of others on the basis of inheritance. In the past, many successful veteran artists could not do without this rule. However, any teacher-student relationship with feudal characteristics cannot avoid the limitations of sectarianism. Only today has this relationship truly changed, and this constraint has been completely broken. The younger generation must cherish this condition, strive to improve, and after a solid foundation, absorb everything, be refined before being broad, and be more refined after being broad, creating and innovating on a solid foundation of inheritance, and gradually establishing their own style.

　　In the past, famous actors mostly taught apprentices after they retired from performing in their later years. Of course, this practice should still be welcomed today. However, teaching art in old age means that they can only talk, not perform. Even if they demonstrate, due to age, it is difficult for students to fully see the teacher's artistic style in their prime, and it is difficult to understand the style and charm of their heyday. If they learn and observe at the same time, the effect will be multiplied. Therefore, in addition to emphasizing the teaching of old artists, advocating that artists in their prime who are currently active on the stage should take on more disciples (mainly teaching young actors with a certain artistic foundation) is also an important aspect. Because they are young and energetic, and radiant on the stage, students can learn, watch, ask for advice, and ponder at the same time, understanding everything in their hearts, studying hard and practicing diligently, and the quality of teaching will inevitably be greatly improved. In recent years, very good results have been achieved in this area. However, actors in their prime are generally unwilling or not very enthusiastic about taking on disciples. Some express modesty, while others focus their energy on artistic creation, making it difficult to take care of everything. These are all facts, but the reasons are not very sufficient. In the old society, actors were unwilling to take on apprentices in their prime, and no matter what reasons they used as excuses, it was nothing more than fearing that the apprentice would become famous, which would be detrimental to them. Even if they reluctantly took on apprentices, they often harbored suspicions. Under the social conditions at that time, this was completely understandable. But today's social system has changed, the relationship between people has changed, everyone has common political ideals, and there is a common ardent desire for the development of the opera genre. The problems that were worried about in the past no longer exist today. It is not to say that all middle-aged actors who were unwilling to take on apprentices in the past had such thoughts, or that some middle-aged artists who are unwilling to take on apprentices now still have some outdated ideas; but there is no need to hide that some middle-aged generation of artists do not pay enough attention to the important significance of cultivating the younger generation and the role they themselves can play in this glorious work. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to raise this issue.

　　If famous actors in their prime take on more disciples under the principle of not hindering their own artistic life, it will also be a great incentive and spur to their own political, artistic, and cultural studies. As a teacher, one must always demand more of oneself. When these comrades are happy to see that their disciples surpass them in the coming years, and the opera art is passed down for thousands of years, with each generation surpassing the previous one, what is that revolutionary sense of honor and happiness compared to the uneasy feeling of having no successors to one's artistic achievements and being unable to truly pass on one's art in old age?

    春风桃李
    马少波
    戏曲艺术源远流长，人才新陈代谢，青年一代总是在继承前辈艺术的基础上，发扬传统，创造新的传统。这是坚定不移的方向，也是客观发展的规律。
    建国十年来，在党和毛主席的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的政策方针的光辉照耀下，戏曲艺术的繁荣发展和新生力量的蓬勃成长，标志着我国戏曲有了新的生命。十年来，戏曲界各方面的变化都是巨大的，新社会的师生关系的新发展，也是这种变化的一个重要方面。
    十年来，全国许多戏曲前辈艺术家都像辛勤的园丁一样，耐心地培育着幼苗。他们培养新生一代的时候，不是以个人主义的态度，而是从人民戏剧事业的长远利益出发，他们把一个剧种艺术的青春和未来，和祖国的青春和未来统一起来了，把个人的利益和社会主义共产主义事业的利益统一起来了。
    在旧社会，戏曲界“拜师收徒”，虽然渊源已久，虽然在艺术的继承和发展中也起过一定的积极作用；但是无可讳言那时的师生关系不少是建立在个人主义的思想基础上，带有浓厚的封建性或受资产阶级思想的某些影响。所谓“师徒如父子”，实质是各自为己。在旧社会尊师爱生的事例当然也有，但徒具虚名者也不在少数。学生诚意不足，不肯好好地学，或递个“门生帖儿”，根本不学，或学一点点缀点缀，无非为了借名标榜；老师也不肯认真地教，或教而不肯倾囊相赠，有的宁可人亡艺绝，不肯授徒传艺。这对于戏曲艺术的发展，又不能不发生消极的影响。
    今天师生关系的进步，正是表现在逐步地克服着这些消极的影响，发扬其积极的作用，真正作到了尊师爱生。因为新的师生关系是建立在社会主义共产主义的思想基础上，既是师生，又是革命同志，有共同的政治理想，有一致的奋斗目标：为了戏曲艺术更灿烂的未来，为社会主义建设和进一步实现共产主义贡献自己的力量。于是教的起劲，学的认真。
    教学关系并不在于形式上是否“拜师收徒”，剧团演员间的教导、专业团体对业余剧团的辅导以及戏曲学校教师的教学，就是在没有举行拜师仪式的情况下进行的。老师们还不是认真地教而学生也在专心地学么？他们不是为了个人的利益，而是为了戏曲艺术的发扬光大，为了更好地为人民服务。这就是最可靠的思想基础。拜师收徒，确定名分，有时是必要的，但这只是建立教学关系的方式之一，不是唯一的方式。
    只要建立教学关系，学生就要恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学，不要小瓶易满，浅尝辄止；同时，也要在一定的基础上逐步地创造发展；老师既要教，也要学。要鼓励学生们的创造精神，也可以从学生那里学到很多东西，特别是青年人的政治上进心和工作中的朝气勃勃。常言道：“教、学相长”，意味是深长的。
    戏曲界有句名言：“艺无常师”。这决不是意味着学而不专；而是说不要被一个老师的艺术成就所束缚，所局限，要在师承的基础上，博采众长。过去许多有成就的前辈艺术家，谁也离不开这一规律。话虽如此，凡是带有封建性的师生关系，终是不能避免门户之限的。只有今天，才真正改变了这种关系，彻底突破了这种束缚。青年一代要十分珍惜这个条件，力求上进，基础稳固之后，兼收并蓄，精而后博，博而益精，在师承坚实的基础上，创造革新，逐渐树立自己的风格。
    过去名演员授徒，多在晚年辍演之后，当然这种作法，现在还是应该欢迎的。但是晚年传艺，只能说，不能演，即使示范演出，由于年龄关系，学生们也很难全部看到老师艺术的当年风范，很难领会其全盛时代的丰采神韵。如果一面学，一面观摩，效果就会事半功倍。因此，除重视老艺人授艺之外，提倡目前正在舞台上活跃的盛年的艺术家多带徒弟（主要是教导已有一定艺术基础的青年演员），也是一个重要的方面。因为他们年富力强，舞台上光彩照人，学生们边学、边看、边请教、边揣摩，心领神会，勤学苦练，教学质量必然大见长进。近几年来，在这方面已经作出了很好的成绩。不过，盛年的演员一般是不大愿意或不大积极于带徒弟的。有的表示谦虚，有的则因精力集中于艺术创造，兼顾困难。这都是事实，但理由并不是很充分的。旧社会中，演员在全盛时代不愿收徒，不管以什么理由为借口，说穿了无非是怕徒弟成名，对自己不利，即使勉强收了，也往往存有戒心。在当时社会条件下，这是完全可以理解的。但今天的社会制度变了，人和人的关系变了，大家都有政治上的共同理想，对剧种来说，也有共同发展的热烈愿望。过去所顾虑的问题今天根本不存在了。并不是说过去不愿带徒弟的中年演员都是这样的想法，或现在不愿意带徒弟的中年演员还存在着一些过时的想法；但也不必隐讳，有的中年一辈的艺术家对于培养青年一代的重要意义以及他们自己在这一光荣的工作中所可能发挥的作用还不是十分重视的。因此借这个机会提出这个问题。
    如果盛年的名演员在不妨碍自己的艺术生活的原则下多带徒弟，对于自己的政治、艺术、文化各方面的进修，也将是很大的激励和督促。为人师表了，总是要更严格地要求自己。当这些同志过些年喜见门墙桃李，超越自己当年，戏曲艺术千秋繁衍，一代胜似一代的时候，那种革命的荣誉感、幸福感，较之自己的艺术成就后继乏人、晚年授艺又难传其真的不安心情为如何呢？
