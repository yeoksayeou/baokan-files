    From Layman to Expert
    I am an ordinary breeder. Under the Party's constant care and education, I gradually recognized the great significance of this ordinary work and transformed from a layman into an expert.
    All comrades in our farm are competing with each other in enthusiasm, learning from the advanced, uniting in friendship, and helping each other. The survival rate of piglets in the whole farm reached 96.6%.
    Recently, all the comrades in our farm enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, wanting to make greater achievements in this new year. I will always listen to the Party's words and further enrich my youthful life in this glorious cause.
    Song Xie Feng, Breeder of Jianxin Pig Farm, Beijing State-Owned Southern Suburb Farm

    外行变成内行
    我是一个普通的饲养员。在党的经常关怀和教育下，我逐渐认清了这项平凡工作的伟大意义，由外行变成了内行。
    我们全场的同志，都是互相比干劲，学先进，团结友爱，彼此帮助。全场的仔猪成活率达到96．6％。
    最近，我们全场的同志，热烈响应党的号召，要在这新的一年里，作出更大的成绩。我要永远听党的话，在这光荣的事业中更加丰富我的青春的生活。
