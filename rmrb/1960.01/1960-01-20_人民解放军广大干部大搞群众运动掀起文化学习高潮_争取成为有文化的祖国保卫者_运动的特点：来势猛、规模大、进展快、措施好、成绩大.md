Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The People's Liberation Army's broad military officers' winter cultural learning has entered a high tide. The entire army is determined to work hard this winter, aiming for "elementary school graduation, middle school acceleration, and university commencement," and to create favorable conditions for the continued great leap forward in cultural and educational work in 1960 with the excellent results of completing the 1959 cultural education annual plan ahead of schedule.

This cultural learning upsurge was formed rapidly throughout the army in November 1959 after the Second Army-wide Cultural and Educational Work Conference summarized the significant achievements made in cultural education over the past ten months and further implemented the spirit of exerting full effort and deeply mobilizing the masses. Its characteristics are: powerful momentum, large scale, rapid progress; strong leadership determination, good measures; sufficient cadre enthusiasm, and great achievements. According to incomplete statistics, in many units in the Nanjing, Guangzhou, Beijing, Jinan, Wuhan, Shenyang, Lanzhou, Chengdu and other regions, the number of cadres participating in the study reached more than 90% of the total number of cadres. Study hours and teaching quality have also greatly exceeded usual levels. Many units that were originally intermediate or backward have become advanced units. The self-study ranks are constantly expanding, and the atmosphere of eagerness to learn has greatly increased. In units such as the Shanghai Garrison District and a certain unit in the Shenyang area, more than 40% of the cadres have begun to develop good self-study habits. During this period, many troops have opened higher education classes; in the Shenyang troops alone, ninety-four university classes have started.

Many self-study groups have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Officers are actively studying, "seizing the morning, squeezing in the evening, with lamps shining brightly into the middle of the night." Many units with very busy tasks and poor learning conditions are also doing everything possible to seize the gaps before and after meals and between construction shifts to study hard. "Seizing time independently, delving into topics independently," learning pacesetters are constantly emerging. They say, "With politics in command, methods come naturally, books are carried with you, and time is 'bonus'," "In the past, studying culture was considered for oneself, sometimes hot and sometimes cold; today, it is clear that studying culture is to meet the needs of the country's socialist construction, and enthusiasm soars to the sky." The broad cadres of a certain unit in the Lanzhou area did not relax their studies even while reclaiming wasteland. They treated barren mountains and depressions as classrooms, working on time and attending classes on time. In the severe cold, the fountain pen ink froze, so they used branches as pens and accumulated snow as paper to calculate exercises, persisting every day without interruption. During winter training, many troops marched long distances and had very little rest time. However, they "took advantage of every crack in time and learned whenever they had a chance." Even if there were only five minutes of rest during the march, they would review an arithmetic problem or make a few sentences, and still insisted on studying dozens of hours each month. A certain organ of the Naval Base originally stipulated two hours of study every night, but the masses generally arrived early and left late, resulting in three hours of study every night. Many cadres in the troops gave up their vacations for study. Li Lin, a cadre of the Qiyang County People's Armed Forces Department in Hunan, walked eighty miles to the countryside, and as soon as he arrived at his destination, he immediately worked hard on his homework. Many cadres said, "Don't be afraid of many difficulties, just be afraid of laziness," "When the word 'difficult' is in the lead, it's hard to move an inch; when the word 'work hard' is in the lead, you can travel a thousand miles a day." Because they insisted on "a long stream, unbroken line" in their studies, many cadres' academic achievements have improved by leaps and bounds.

In organizing winter cultural learning, party committees at all levels of the PLA put politics in command, launched mass movements, and adopted various measures to promote the learning upsurge. Most units above the division level in the Shenyang area have convened party committees or political work conferences to seriously study and deploy cultural and educational work. Many troops also launched mass airing of views and debates on the indicators and measures of winter cultural education, sweeping away conservative ideas that did not fully recognize and have confidence in cultural education, and establishing the leap forward idea of ​​striving to study for the country's socialist construction. Subsequently, the troops boldly solved some specific problems in cultural education, such as equipping teachers, purchasing teaching aids, and scientifically resolving the contradiction between work and study time, making thorough organizational preparations for vigorously carrying out winter cultural education. Troops in Shenyang, Jinan, Lanzhou and other places also held learning mobilization, oath-taking, and skill-comparison meetings, expressing their ambitions, proposing measures, comparing their enthusiasm, launching challenges and responses, and stimulating the learning enthusiasm of military officers. According to the characteristics of the dispersed border troops, the Kunming area troops adopted the method of mobile teaching groups, establishing teaching points according to the stationed location, so that all personnel who should participate in the study have the opportunity to study. Many cadres praised the mobile teaching group for having three no fears: "not afraid of many points and long lines, not afraid of inconvenient transportation, not afraid of heavy tasks, everyone can learn culture."

In order to sustain the high tide of winter cultural learning and the enthusiasm of the masses for learning, the PLA troops are currently focusing on catching up with advanced units in intermediate and backward units, taking advantage of the good opportunity in winter. A certain unit in the Nanjing area convened a conference of advanced units and activists in cultural learning, commended Platoon Leader Han Zheyan, who had improved from upper primary school to high school level through four years of self-study, and launched a movement to learn from Han Zheyan's hard self-study. The Guangzhou troops' "Learning from the New Method, Catching up with Yao Yuheng" learning pacesetter movement is also being carried out enthusiastically. (Attached picture)

    人民解放军广大干部大搞群众运动掀起文化学习高潮
    争取成为有文化的祖国保卫者
    运动的特点：来势猛、规模大、进展快、措施好、成绩大
    新华社19日讯　中国人民解放军广大军官冬季文化学习进入高潮。全军上下决心大干一冬，以“小学过关，中学加鞭，大学上马”和提前完成1959年文化教育年度计划的优良成绩，为1960年文教工作的继续跃进创造良好条件。
    这次文化学习高潮，是在1959年11月间全军第二次文教工作会议总结了全军十个月来文化教育取得显著成就的基础上，进一步贯彻了鼓足干劲，深入发动群众的精神，迅速在全军范围内形成的。它的特点是：来势猛，规模大，进展快；领导决心强，措施好；干部干劲足，成绩大。据不完全统计，南京、广州、北京、济南、武汉、沈阳、兰州、成都等地区许多部队参加学习的干部达到了干部总数的90％以上。学习时数和教学质量也大大超过了平时。许多原来属于中间或落后的单位变成了先进单位。自学队伍不断扩大，好学风气也大大增长。上海警备区、沈阳地区某部队等单位，已有40％以上的干部开始养成了良好的自学习惯。这期间，不少部队开办了高等教育班次，仅沈阳部队就有九十四个大学班开了课。
    许多部队自学小组如雨后春笋般涌现出来。军官们“抓早上，挤晚上，灯光莹莹午夜不息”地积极学习。好多任务十分繁忙、学习条件很差的部队也千方百计抓紧饭前饭后、施工交接班的间隙时间，刻苦学习。“自抓时间，自钻课题”的学习标兵不断涌现。他们说，“政治挂了帅，办法自然来，书本随身带，时间是‘外快’”，“过去认为学文化为自己，时冷时热；今天明确了学文化是适应祖国社会主义建设需要，干劲冲天”。兰州地区某部队广大干部在垦荒中也不放松学习。他们把荒山野洼当课堂，按时劳动，按时上课。严寒中，钢笔水冻住了，他们就用树枝当笔，积雪作纸，演算习题，日日坚持，从不中辍。许多部队在冬季训练中，长途跋涉，休息时间很少。但他们“见缝插针，有空就学”，行军休息时那怕只有五分钟，也要温习一道算术题或造几个句子，每月仍然坚持学习了几十个小时。海军基地某机关原规定每晚学习两小时，但群众普遍早到迟退，结果每晚学习了三小时。许多部队的干部为学习放弃了休假。湖南祁阳县人民武装部干部李林下乡步行八十里，一到目的地首先抓紧作作业。许多干部都说，“不怕困难多，就怕惰性大”，“难字当头，寸步难行；干字当头，日行千里。”由于在学习上坚持了“长流水，不断线”，使不少干部学习成绩突飞猛进。
    在组织冬季文化学习中，解放军各级党委都政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，采取各种措施，促进学习高潮。沈阳地区绝大部分师以上单位都召开过党委会或政工会议认真研究和部署文教工作。不少部队还就冬季文化教育的指标和措施，展开了群众性的鸣放辩论，横扫对文化教育认识不足和信心不大的保守思想，大立为祖国社会主义建设发奋学习的跃进思想。接着，各部队又大刀阔斧地解决了文化教育中的一些具体问题，如配备教员，购置教具，科学地解决工作和学习的时间矛盾等等，为大搞冬季文化教育作了周密的组织准备。沈阳、济南、兰州等地部队还召开学习动员、誓师、比武大会等，表雄心，提措施，比干劲，发起挑应战，激励军官们的学习积极性。昆明地区部队根据边防部队分散的特点，采取了巡回教学组的方法，按驻地建立教学点，使一切应该参加学习的人员都有机会学习。许多干部赞扬巡回教学组有三不怕：“不怕点多线长，不怕交通不便，不怕任务繁重，人人都能学文化。”
    为了使冬季文化学习高潮和群众的学习干劲持续下去，目前解放军各部队正在大抓中等单位和后进单位，利用冬季大好时机迎头赶上先进单位。南京地区某部召开了文化学习先进单位和积极分子会议，表扬了自学四年从高小提高到高中程度的排长韩哲彦，开展了学习韩哲彦刻苦自学的运动。广州部队的“学于新法，赶姚玉珩”的学习标兵运动，也在热火朝天地开展。（附图片）
