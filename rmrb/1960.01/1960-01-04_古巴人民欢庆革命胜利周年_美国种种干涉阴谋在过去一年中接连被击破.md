Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 2nd -- The Cuban people, with the determination to crush the interference and attacks of enemies at home and abroad, stepped into 1960. The conspiracy and clamor of counter-revolutionary groups based in Miami, USA, to attack Cuba on the eve of the festival has become material for people to laugh at.

On January 1, the Cuban people celebrated the first anniversary of the victory of the revolution that overthrew the tyrannical rule with joy, celebrating the brilliant victory achieved in defeating foreign intervention and in land reform over the past year. On the day of the festival, the entire Havana was colorful, the streets were decorated with eye-catching slogans of unity to defend the Cuban revolution, and every family in Havana was filled with joy. Militias composed of workers and youth marched hand in hand on the streets, singing the 26th of July March.

The newspapers in the capital Havana all published special issues on January 1 to celebrate the first anniversary of the victory of the Cuban revolution. The National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party issued a letter to workers, peasants, and all people, calling on them to be prepared to defend and advance the revolution in the new year.

Activities celebrating the first anniversary of liberation were held in Santiago de Cuba in Oriente Province, Santa Clara in Las Villas Province, and other cities in Cuba.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Our correspondent reports: In 1959, the Cuban people, who overthrew the Batista tyranny, advanced victoriously in defeating a series of interventionist plots by US imperialism.

The collapse of the Batista dictatorship and the establishment of a democratic regime in Cuba was one of the most serious defeats suffered by the United States in Latin America. The US ruling group hates the Cuban revolution to the bone and is determined to strangle it. Throughout the year, the United States has never stopped its activities to interfere in and subvert Cuba from the outside and inside.

The United States has increased its troops by 30,000 to the US naval base Guantanamo in Cuba, as a big stick that can be used for intervention in Cuba at any time. At the same time, conspiracies to launch armed attacks on Cuba have been underway in the city of Miami, Florida, near Cuba, and in the territory ruled by the US pawn, the Dominican dictatorship, and in other areas of Central America. Throughout the year, planes taking off from Florida and the Dominican Republic have continuously invaded Cuban airspace for reconnaissance and provocation. Under the guidance of the US military authorities, the Dominican dictatorship has organized a mercenary army of 10,000 people, specially prepared for the invasion of Cuba. According to recent revelations in the Cuban newspapers, the United States is accelerating its work of organizing and training mercenaries and Batista bandits in Miami, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Nicaragua, and other places. Under the instigation of the United States, the Dominican Republic is also deploying troops and preparing to make trouble.

On the other hand, the United States is stepping up the collection of fugitive Cuban counter-revolutionaries and colluding with the remaining counter-revolutionary forces in Cuba, instigating them to carry out rebellions and subversive activities, in order to cooperate with the military operations planned by the United States and achieve the goal of internal and external cooperation. Masferrer, a well-known secret agent leader during the Batista dictatorship, Piedra, the former director of the "Investigation Bureau", Diaz Lanz, the former air force commander of the Cuban counter-revolutionary traitor, and many other counter-revolutionary leaders, as well as the notorious Cuban counter-revolutionary organizations such as the "White Rose" are all active in Miami and receive support from the United States in terms of money and weapons. Under the auspices of US secret service agencies, hundreds of special agents have been dispatched from Miami and the Dominican Republic to sneak into Cuba, and together with counter-revolutionary elements in Cuba, they created a series of explosions, assassinations and sabotage activities in the second half of last year. Under the manipulation of the interfering black hands of the US ruling group, Cuba successively experienced the counter-revolutionary conspiracies of former Air Force Commander Diaz Lanz, former President Urrutia, former Camagüey Province troop commander Matos, the large-scale rebellion conspiracy in August last year, and many other conspiracy cases.

While plotting the above-mentioned armed attacks and subversion conspiracies, the United States has been trying to use the "Organization of American States" that it controls to cover up its interventionist actions. The United States especially wants to organize an "international police force" under the guise of this Pan-American organization to interfere in Cuba and suppress the national movements of other Latin American countries. Although this plan failed to materialize at the Central American summit in June last year and the meeting of American foreign ministers in August, the United States still intends to promote this conspiracy again at the meeting of American foreign ministers scheduled to be held in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, in February this year.

Land reform, one of the basic contents of the current stage of the Cuban revolution, is being carried out effectively. Since last year, large amounts of land occupied by American monopoly companies, Batista elements, and Cuban large landowners have been distributed to farmers throughout Cuba. In Camagüey Province, the Cuban government has confiscated tens of thousands of caballerias (one caballeria equals 201.45 acres) of land from American monopoly capital's sugar and livestock estates, including the King Ranch, the largest American livestock estate in Cuba, and large areas of land from the Gulf-Atlantic Sugar Company and other American sugar monopoly organizations. The Cuban National Land Reform Committee recently announced that as of December 3, it had taken over 575 estates with a total area of 65,653 caballerias. Land reform has created good preconditions for transforming Cuba's single-crop economy, increasing agricultural production, and achieving industrialization. At present, various agricultural and animal husbandry cooperatives established by the Cuban government in the process of land reform are growing day by day. According to the materials of the Cuban National Land Reform Committee, the implementation of land reform has enabled Cuban agricultural production to reach an unprecedented level. Last year, Cuba's rice production increased by 1.5 million quintals compared with the harvest in 1958, and the output of other potatoes, tomatoes, etc. also increased significantly. According to the plan, Cuba's staple food rice, which mainly relied on imports from the United States in the past, will strive to be self-sufficient within three to five years, and potato production is expected to supply the entire country in 1960.

In diplomacy, in order to get rid of the control and influence of the United States, the Cuban government has vigorously developed diplomatic and trade relations with other Latin American countries and Asian and African countries over the past year. The Cuban government has also carried out sugar trade with the Soviet Union, and various civil groups have actively developed friendly exchanges with socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and China.

1959 was a year of victory for the Cuban people and a year of failure for US imperialist aggression against Cuba.

    古巴人民欢庆革命胜利周年
    美国种种干涉阴谋在过去一年中接连被击破
    新华社哈瓦那2日电　古巴人民怀着粉碎国内外敌人的干涉和进攻的决心跨进了1960年。以美国迈阿密为基地的反革命集团要在节日前夕进攻古巴的阴谋和喧嚷，已经成为人们嘲笑的资料。
    1月1日，古巴人民以欢欣的心情庆祝推翻暴政统治的革命胜利一周年，庆祝一年来击溃外国干涉和在土地改革中所取得的辉煌胜利。节日的一天，整个哈瓦那五彩缤纷，街道上装饰着团结起来保卫古巴革命的醒目标语，哈瓦那的每一个家庭都充满了欢乐。工人和青年组成的民兵手携手地在大街上游行，高唱着7月26日进行曲。
    首都哈瓦那的报纸1日都出版了庆祝古巴革命胜利一周年纪念的专号。古巴人民社会党全国委员会发表了告工人、农民和全体人民书，号召他们做好准备，以便在新的一年保卫革命和推进革命。
    在奥连特省的圣地亚哥城、拉斯维利亚斯省的圣克拉拉城以及古巴的其他城市都举行了庆祝解放一周年的活动。
    新华社讯　本社记者报道：1959年，推翻了巴蒂斯塔暴政的古巴人民，在击破美帝国主义的一连串干涉阴谋中胜利前进。
    巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的崩溃和古巴民主政权的建立是美国在拉丁美洲所遭受的最严重的一次失败。美国统治集团对古巴革命恨之入骨，一定要扼杀之而后快。在整整一年中，美国一刻也没有停止它从外部和内部来干涉和颠覆古巴的活动。
    美国增派了三万名军队前往在古巴的美国海军基地关塔那摩，作为随时可以动用的干涉古巴的大棒。同时，对古巴发动武装进攻的阴谋一直在靠近古巴的美国佛罗里达州迈阿密城和美国走卒多米尼加独裁政权统治下的领土上以及中美其他地区中进行。一年来，从佛罗里达和多米尼加起飞的飞机不断侵入古巴领空侦察和挑衅。多米尼加独裁政权在美国军事当局指导下已经组织了一支一万人的雇佣军，准备专门用来侵略古巴。根据最近几天古巴报纸的揭露，美国正在加速它在迈阿密、多米尼加、海地、尼加拉瓜等地组织和训练雇佣军和巴蒂斯塔匪徒的工作。在美国指使下的多米尼加也正在调兵遣将，蠢蠢欲动。
    另一方面，美国加紧收罗逃亡的古巴反革命分子和勾结古巴国内残存的反革命势力，策动他们进行叛乱和颠覆活动，以便同美国策划的军事行动相配合，达到里应外合的目的。巴蒂斯塔独裁政权时代的著名特务头子马斯费雷尔、前“调查局”局长彼德拉、古巴反革命叛徒前空军司令迪亚斯·兰斯和其他许多反革命头目以及臭名昭著的“白玫瑰”等古巴反革命组织都在迈阿密公开活动，并且得到美国金钱和武器等各方面的支持。在美国特务机关主持下，从迈阿密和多米尼加曾经派遣了好几百名特务潜入古巴，同古巴国内反革命分子一起在去年下半年制造了一连串爆炸、暗杀和破坏活动。在美国统治集团干涉黑手的拨弄下，古巴连续发生了前空军司令迪亚斯·兰斯、前总统乌鲁蒂亚、前卡马圭省部队司令马托斯的反革命阴谋和去年8月间的大规模叛乱阴谋以及其他许多阴谋案件。
    在策动上述武装进攻和颠覆阴谋的同时，美国一直企图利用它所控制的“美洲国家组织”来掩护它的干涉行动。美国特别想要在这个泛美组织的幌子下组织一支“国际警察部队”，来干涉古巴和镇压其他拉丁美洲国家的民族运动。尽管这个打算在去年6月中美国家会议和8月美洲国家外长会议上没有能实现，但是，美国仍然打算在预定今年2月在厄瓜多尔首都基多召开的美洲国家外长会议上，再次推行这个阴谋。
    作为古巴目前阶段革命的基本内容之一的土地改革工作，正在有成效地进行中。去年以来，古巴全国各地已经把大批美国垄断公司、巴蒂斯塔分子和古巴大庄园主所占有的土地分配给农民。在卡马圭省，古巴政府征收了美国垄断资本的糖业和牧畜大庄园的好几万卡瓦耶里亚（一卡瓦耶里亚等于二百零一点四五亩）的土地，其中包括美国在古巴最大的牧畜业庄园金氏牧场和美国糖业垄断组织海湾—大西洋糖业公司等的大片土地。古巴土地改革全国委员会不久前宣布，截至12月3日为止，已经接管了总面积达六万五千六百五十三卡瓦耶里亚的五百七十五个庄园。土地改革为改造古巴的单一作物经济、提高农业生产、实现工业化创造了良好的前提。目前，古巴政府在土地改革过程中投资建立的各种农牧业合作社正在与日俱增。据古巴土地改革全国委员会的材料，土地改革的实行已经使古巴农业生产达到前所未有的水平。去年古巴稻米生产比1958年的收获量增加了一百五十万公担，其他土豆、西红柿等产量也有显著增加。根据计划，过去主要依靠从美国进口的古巴人民主食大米，将争取在三、五年内自足自给，土豆生产预计1960年能供应全国。
    在外交上，古巴政府为了摆脱美国的控制和影响，一年来大力开展了同拉丁美洲其他国家以及亚非各国的外交和贸易关系。古巴政府还同苏联进行了糖的贸易，各种民间团体还积极开展了同苏联、中国等社会主义国家的友好往来关系。
    1959年是古巴人民胜利的一年，也是美帝国主义对古巴侵略失败的一年。
