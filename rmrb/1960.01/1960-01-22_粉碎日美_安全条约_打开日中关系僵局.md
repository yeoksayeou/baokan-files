Smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and Open the Deadlock in Sino-Japanese Relations
Yasui Iku, Chairman of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs

In February of last year, I visited China after liberation for the first time and received a warm welcome from the Chinese people. At that time, I delivered a speech at a gathering in Beijing entitled: "The Movement in Japan to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is the Foundation for Opening Sino-Japanese Relations." "People's Daily" conveyed the full text of the speech to the broad masses of the Chinese people, for which I express my heartfelt gratitude. A year has passed since then, and both the international situation and the domestic situation in Japan have undergone tremendous changes. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to express my views to the Chinese people again through the "People's Daily."

Generally speaking, the changes in the international situation completely prove the correctness of the famous thesis made by Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party that "the East wind prevails over the West wind." The Soviet Union, standing at the forefront of the socialist camp in close cooperation with China, played an active role in turning 1959 into a year of great transformation in the international situation. The national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as the movements of the masses of people in capitalist countries to fight for peace, have also dealt heavy blows to the imperialists' war policies. Under this new international situation, some imperialists dare not adopt blatant war policies and are forced to adopt a peaceful posture. But they have not sincerely abandoned their war policies. How could groups that rely on adhering to the "Cold War" and the arms race for their interests simply abandon their war policies? The contradiction between the forces of peace and the forces of war still exists. But the forces of peace have definitely become the main aspect of this contradiction.

The international situation has undergone such tremendous changes. However, in some countries, the forces of war still dominate and impose brutal suppression on domestic forces of peace. West Germany is one example.

In Japan, a fierce struggle is currently taking place between the forces of war and the forces of peace. The revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is the central issue of this struggle.

The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, colluding with the U.S. government, signed a new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," openly establishing a U.S.-Japan military alliance. The establishment of this military alliance is primarily to meet the strategic requirements of the United States. The United States' plan to establish a Northeast Asian military alliance for many years has now been completed by combining the U.S.-Chiang and U.S.-Rhee military alliances with this new U.S.-Japan military alliance. With the establishment of the U.S.-Japan military alliance, Japan will be incorporated into the U.S. nuclear strategy system. The United States wants to make Japan a nuclear war base against China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries. Japan will inevitably embark on the path of militarist revival and nuclear armament.

This policy of the Kishi Cabinet runs counter to the trend of the easing international situation and also violates the Japanese Constitution, which stipulates the abandonment of war. The new U.S.-Japan treaty is not true to its name; it is not for "ensuring security" at all. On the contrary, it will put the Japanese people in danger of destruction. Not only that, but the U.S.-Japan military alliance will intensify the tense situation in the Far East and pose a serious threat to the people of China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries.

The Japanese people's anger has finally erupted against the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's actions that violate the interests of the Japanese people and the people of all countries. The Japanese people's movement to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" has rapidly surged from the end of last year to the beginning of this year. It has developed into a comprehensive and large-scale national movement centered on the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty," encompassing both unified actions and individual actions by various groups and individuals. Students from Zengakuren (All-Japan Federation of Student Associations) tried to use force to prevent the "plenipotentiary delegation" headed by Kishi Nobusuke from visiting the United States at Haneda Airport; workers from Sohyo (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan) and various independent unions launched strikes and other protest movements in various posts; women held "Mothers and Daughters Express Grief and Indignation Rallies"; cultural figures wore black mourning bands and held silent demonstrations; religious figures marched in the streets with banners and hymns... The movement takes various forms, but all these actions are filled with the Japanese people's strong protests against the Kishi Cabinet's actions. All the strength accumulated by the Japanese peace movement over the past decade has now been concentrated on the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement is also shouldering an important task in the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty." As evidenced by the collection of 35 million signatures calling for a ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs and the participation of 10 million Japanese people in the peace march ending in Hiroshima, the broadest strata of Japanese society are united in the peace movement. Many people belonging to the conservative camp also participate in this movement. The central and local organizations that lead this movement have decided to participate fully in the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty." In accordance with this decision, the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, held in Hiroshima in August last year, discussed the issue of revising the "Security Treaty." The Kishi Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party immediately imposed strong political pressure on the conference, and right-wing groups even rushed to Hiroshima to inflict violence on the conference cadres and representatives. However, the masses of people who have actively participated in the anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement for many years used their wisdom and courage to counter this oppression and violence, not only ensuring the victory of the "conference under the storm," but also further strengthening the movement as a result of this training. Through the discussions at the conference, the representatives deeply recognized the serious nature of the "Security Treaty" issue. They also brought the achievements of the conference back to all parts of the country and explained the necessity of preventing the revision of the "Security Treaty" to the broad masses of the people through report meetings held in various towns and villages, thereby enabling people who had not understood the "Security Treaty" in the past to begin to pay attention to this issue. This effort became the greatest driving force behind the subsequent climax of the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Although the people of all strata in Japan have expressed their protests so forcefully, the Kishi Cabinet, which controls a majority of seats in the Diet, ignores the will of the people, wants to forcibly sign a new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and further ratify this treaty. Even if the Kishi Cabinet forcibly concludes a new treaty in disregard of the people's protests, the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" will not lose its significance. It will turn into a struggle to smash the "security system," igniting even greater flames.

I would like to specifically state here that this struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and to smash the "security system" is filled with the Japanese people's sincere feelings of atonement towards the Chinese people.

In the past, Japan invaded China and brought immeasurable suffering to the Chinese people. The Japanese people are seriously reflecting on this matter. More than a decade has passed since the end of the war, and the pain in our hearts has not yet disappeared. Although the Chinese people sincerely say that it was the crimes committed by Japanese imperialists and militarists, and should not be blamed on the Japanese people, we believe that we should not fail to live up to this well-intentioned statement. We should also atone from our own standpoint.

To atone from our own standpoint, what should we do? It is not enough to just talk about apologies. We must take action to prevent the revival of Japanese imperialism and militarism, crush the plot of Japan's nuclear armament, liberate the Japanese mainland and Okinawa from the rule of the U.S. nuclear strategy system, and further establish friendly relations between a peaceful and neutral Japan and China. Only this is the true path for us to atone. The Japanese peace movement is advancing along this basic line, and the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and to smash the "security system" is currently its focus.

The Kishi Cabinet says that it wants to consolidate the "security system" and then seek to open the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations on this basis. This is obviously full of contradictions. Without talking about the past, at a time when the current international situation is tending towards easing, it is going against this trend, re-concluding a military alliance that is hostile to China and other countries on the one hand, and wanting to open the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations on the other hand. This approach is an insult to China. If we want to open the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations, we must first establish an attitude of abolishing the military alliance that is hostile to China. Based on this reason, smashing the "security system" and opening the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations are two sides of the same coin.

The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has decided to include the issue of smashing the "security system" and opening the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations in its basic line of the 1960 movement. From the nature of the anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement, we believe that uniting the broad masses of people is an important task for advancing this struggle. For this purpose, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs plans to first launch various movements centered on preventing the revision of the "Security Treaty" on March 1, the sixth anniversary of the disaster suffered by Japanese fishermen in Bikini Atoll; then hold a larger-scale peace march than last year with the participation of 20 million Japanese people; and on the basis of this achievement, also convene the "Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs for Complete Disarmament" in August, the fifteenth anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Regarding the convening of this world conference, we sincerely hope to receive the enthusiastic support and cooperation of the Chinese people, and at the same time firmly resolve to strive to create good conditions so as to realize the first welcome of Chinese representatives to participate in the conference in three years.

The forces of war at home and abroad may launch various persecutions against the Japanese peace movement with this basic line. But we believe in the wisdom and courage of the Japanese people, and at the same time believe in the great power of the world's forces of peace. We are confident that by gathering all these forces, the Japanese peace movement will eventually overcome all obstacles and achieve a glorious victory!

### 粉碎日美“安全条约”  打开日中关系僵局

    粉碎日美“安全条约”  打开日中关系僵局
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长　安井郁
    去年2月，我第一次访问了解放后的中国，受到了中国人民热诚的欢迎。那时，我在北京举行的一次集会上发表过一篇演说，题目是：“日本要求禁止原子弹、氢弹的运动是打开中日关系的基础”。“人民日报”曾把演说全文传达给广大的中国人民，这是我衷心表示感谢的。自从那时以来，时间经过了一年，国际形势和日本国内形势都有了巨大的变化。因此，在这里我想通过“人民日报”再向中国人民表明我的见解。
    总的说来，国际形势的变化，完全证明了中国共产党主席毛泽东所作的“东风压倒西风”这个著名论断的正确性。站在社会主义阵营前列的苏联在同中国密切的合作下，对把1959年变成国际形势大转变的一年起了主动的作用。亚非以及拉丁美洲的民族民主运动和资本主义各国人民群众争取和平的运动，也都给帝国主义者的战争政策以沉重的打击。在这种新的国际形势下，一部分帝国主义者不敢采取露骨的战争政策，被迫采取了和平姿态。但是它们并不是真心抛弃了战争政策的。依靠坚持“冷战”和军备竞赛取得利益的集团怎么会简单地抛弃战争政策呢？和平力量和战争势力之间的矛盾仍然存在着。但是和平力量已经肯定地变成这个矛盾的主要方面。
    国际形势有了这样巨大变化。但是，在某些国家战争势力至今仍然占着优势，对国内的和平力量施加残暴的镇压。西德就是一个实例。
    在日本，目前战争势力同和平力量之间进行着激烈的斗争。修改日美“安全条约”是这个斗争的中心问题。
    岸信介内阁勾结美国政府，签订新的日美“安全条约”，公开建立日美军事同盟。这个军事同盟的建立，首先是为了适应美国在战略上的要求。多年来想建立东北亚军事同盟的美国的计划，由于把美蒋、美李军事同盟和这个新的日美军事同盟结合起来，就此完成了。由于建立日美军事同盟，日本将被纳入美国核战略体系，美国要使日本成为对中苏两国以及亚洲各国的核战争基地，日本必然将走上军国主义复活和核武装的道路。
    岸内阁的这种政策是与趋向缓和的国际形势的动向背道而驰的，同时也违反了规定抛弃战争的日本宪法。新的日美条约名不符实，完全不是为了“保障安全”，相反地将使日本人民陷入毁灭的危险。不仅这样，日美军事同盟将使远东紧张局势加剧，并且给中苏两国以及亚洲各国人民造成严重的威胁。
    对于岸信介内阁这种违反日本人民以及各国人民利益的行为，日本人民的愤怒终于爆发了。日本人民阻止修改“安全条约”的运动，在从去年年底到今年年初期间，迅速高涨起来。它已经发展到以阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议为中心而展开的统一行动和包括各种团体与个人的个别行动在内的综合性的大规模的国民运动。全学联的学生在羽田机场要以实力阻止以岸信介为首的“全权团”访美；总评和各独立工会的工人们在各种岗位上展开罢工和其他抗议运动；妇女们举行了“母亲和女儿表示悲愤大会”；文化界人士佩带着黑色丧章举行静肃示威游行；宗教界人士高举着标语牌、唱着赞美歌到街头举行游行……。运动有各种各样的形式，但是在所有这些行动里都充满着日本人民对岸内阁的行为的强烈的抗议情绪。日本的和平运动十几年来积聚的一切力量目前都集中到阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争中来了。
    禁止原子弹和氢弹运动也在阻止修改“安全条约”斗争中肩负着重要的任务。正如征集三千五百万人禁止原子弹、氢弹的签名和一千万名日本人民参加的以广岛为终点的和平大游行所标志的那样，在日本的和平运动里团结了最广大的阶层。属于保守阵营的人们，也有很多参加这个运动。主持这个运动的中央组织和地方组织已经决定将全力参加阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争。按照这个决定，去年8月在广岛召开的第五届禁止原子弹、氢弹世界大会讨论了修改“安全条约”的问题，岸内阁和自由民主党马上对大会加以强烈的政治压迫，右翼团体还赶到广岛对大会干部和代表们施加暴力。但是多年来积极参加禁止原子弹氢弹运动的人民群众用智慧和勇气反击了这种压迫与暴力，不仅保证了“暴风雨下的大会”的胜利，并且由于经过这种锻炼而进一步加强了运动。代表们通过大会的讨论，深刻地认识了“安全条约”问题的严重性质。他们并且把大会的成就带回全国各地，通过在各町各村举行的报告集会，向广大人民群众阐明了阻止修改“安全条约”的必要性，从而使过去对“安全条约”没有理解的人们开始关怀这个问题。这种努力成为随后到来的阻止修改“安全条约”斗争高潮的最大的动力。
    虽然，日本各阶层人民这样有力地表达了抗议的情绪，但是控制国会多数议席的岸内阁却忽视人民的意志，要强行签订新的日美“安全条约”，并且进一步批准这项条约。尽管岸内阁不顾人民的抗议强行缔结新条约，日本人民阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争并不由此而丧失了它的意义。它将变成粉碎“安全体系”的斗争，燃起更大的烈火。
    我在这里要特地申述，在这个阻止修改“安全条约”与粉碎“安全体系”的斗争中，充满着日本人民对中国人民诚恳的赎罪的心情。
    在过去，日本侵略了中国，对中国人民带来了不可估量的痛苦，日本人民对这件事情进行着严肃的反省。在战争结束后经过十几年的今天，我们心里的痛苦尚未消逝。虽然中国人民诚恳地说，那是日本帝国主义者与军国主义者所犯的罪恶，而不应归罪于日本人民。但是我们认为，我们不要辜负充满善意的这句话。我们也应该从我们的立场去赎罪。
    要从我们的立场去赎罪，应该怎样做才好呢？只靠嘴巴讲谢罪的话是不行的。我们必须以行动来阻止
  日本帝国主义与军国主义的复活，粉碎日本进行核武装的阴谋，从美国核战略体系统治下把日本内地和冲绳解放出来，并且进一步在和平中立的日本同中国之间建立起友好关系，只有这一条才是我们真正能够赎罪的途径。日本的和平运动正顺着这条基本路线而推进，阻止修改“安全条约”与粉碎“安全体系”的斗争目前成为它的中心。
    岸内阁说，它要在巩固了“安全体系”后，站在这个基础上谋求打开日中关系僵局，显然这是充满矛盾的。过去的事不用谈，在目前国际形势趋向缓和的时候，要与这种潮流背道而驰，在一方面重新缔结与中国以及其他各国为敌的军事同盟，同时另一方面想打开日中关系僵局，这种作法是对中国的侮辱。如果要打开日中关系僵局，必须首先确立取消与中国为敌的军事同盟的态度。根据这个理由，粉碎“安全体系”和打开日中关系僵局正是一个问题的两方面。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会已决定，将在1960年度运动基本路线中包括粉碎“安全体系”和打开日中关系僵局的问题。从禁止原子弹氢弹运动的性质看来，我们认为，团结广大阶层人民是推进这个斗争的重要任务。为了这种目的，日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会预定，首先将在日本渔民在比基尼岛受灾六周年的3月1日，展开以阻止修改“安全条约”为中心的各项运动；接着将举行比去年更大规模的有两千万名日本人民参加的和平大游行；在这个成就的基础上，还将在广岛和长崎遭受原子弹轰炸十五周年的8月召开“为争取完全裁军的第六届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会”。关于召开这次世界大会，我们衷心渴望得到中国人民热烈的支持和合作，同时坚定地决心努力制造良好条件，以便实现三年来第一次迎接中国代表前来参加大会。
    对具有这种基本路线的日本的和平运动，国内外战争势力可能要发动种种迫害。但是我们相信日本人民群众的智慧和勇气，同时相信全世界和平力量的伟大威力。我们确信，依靠汇集这一切力量，日本的和平运动终将排除一切障碍，而取得辉煌的胜利！
