The Experiences of the Fourth Generation Clay Figure Zhang
Clay Sculptor Zhang Ming

I greet 1960 with excitement and joy! I also wholeheartedly cheer for the rebirth of our country's clay sculpture art!

The Zhang family's clay sculpture art began with the first generation (Zhang Mingshan), and it has been passed down to us as the fourth generation. For over a hundred years, the clay figurines known as "Clay Figure Zhang" have been loved and welcomed by the masses. However, before liberation, we clay sculpture artists lived a life of poverty and were also deceived and extorted by the reactionary rulers.

In the old society, our Zhang family, for four generations, lived a life of darkness. The first generation was my great-grandfather, Zhang Mingshan. He was the founder of the Tianjin clay sculpture enterprise. His works were widely circulated and deeply loved by the people. But when his works were seen by the emperor at the time, he was forced to enter the palace to serve the princesses and nobles. He lived like a prisoner in the palace, with no freedom of movement and no permission to visit relatives. He was a working person and could not stand the corrupt and degenerate life in the court, nor was he willing to provide his artistic labor for only a small group of people to enjoy. Therefore, one night, he escaped from the palace. To avoid being caught, he had to go south and live a wandering life. The second generation was my grandfather, Zhang Yuting. He worked diligently for over seventy years and created more than 20,000 works. Even in his old age, he never had a good day. The third generation was my uncle, Zhang Jinghu. He grew up during the period of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang. At that time, there was no market for clay figures. In order to eat and to preserve the ancestral clay sculpture art, he had to make some small clay figures and sell them on the street! Enduring hardship until the fourth generation, which is me and my brothers, we could not make a living by making clay figures. We had to reluctantly put down the art that had been passed down for generations and work as temporary workers in chemical factories to earn some money to maintain a minimal life. Seeing that the clay sculpture art was about to be submerged and disappear, our Zhang family was heartbroken!

After liberation, we folk artists saw the light of day again. The Party and the government spent a lot of manpower and material resources to collect the works of the first and second generation Clay Figure Zhang, and exhibited and displayed them as national treasures for the people to appreciate. At the same time, our lives were properly arranged: My grandfather is ninety years old. In 1954, he went to work at the Museum of Literature and History, spending a happy old age. My uncle, Zhang Jinghu, first worked at the Central Academy of Fine Arts and now works at the Central Academy of Arts and Design. Zhang Jingxi is the deputy director of the Arts and Crafts Factory. My younger brother Zhang Yue and I both work at the Art Museum. All the clay sculpture artists who had changed careers or transferred to other professions were also re-enlisted. In order to improve our creative level, in 1957, the Party and the government sent my uncle Zhang Jinghu to Sichuan, Yunnan and other provinces to observe the lives of various ethnic groups, visit the stone carvings in Yungang and other places, and exchange experiences with Jingdezhen, Wuxi, Tangshan and other places, and spread the clay figure Zhang clay sculpture art. At the same time, the Tianjin Clay Figure Zhang Clay Sculpture Factory was established, and some high school and junior high school students were sent to learn clay sculpture, with the aim of cultivating new forces in a planned and purposeful way, so that the clay sculpture art not only continued but also had great development.

Politically, we also completely turned ourselves around. The Party and the people gave us great trust and honor. Zhang Jinghu, Zhang Jingxi and I have all served as members of the National, Hebei Province and Tianjin Municipal People's Political Consultative Conferences, participating in the political life of the country. In 1955, I was named a National Advanced Worker and went to Beijing to attend a meeting, where I met our great leader Chairman Mao.

September 1957 was an unforgettable day in my life. The Party accepted me into the Chinese Communist Party, and I became a glorious Communist Party member, thus beginning my new life. In the past ten years, the Party has spent a lot of effort educating me and cultivating me, making me from an ordinary folk artist into a communist fighter. I thank the Party, and in the new year, I will, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, go all out and create more and better works to better serve the people.

    四代泥人张的遭遇
    彩塑艺人　张铭
    我怀着激动愉快的心情迎接1960年。我也衷心地欢呼我国彩塑艺术的新生！
    张家的彩塑艺术是由第一代（张明山）开始的，传到我们已是第四代了。一百几十年来被称为泥人张的彩塑艺术品一直受到群众的喜爱和欢迎，然而我们彩塑艺人解放前却过着衣食无着的生活，并且还受到反动统治者的欺骗勒索。
    在旧社会里，我们泥人张家四代都过着暗无天日的生活。第一代是我的曾祖父张明山。他是天津彩塑事业的创始人。他的作品流传很广，深受人民群众的喜爱。但当他的作品被当时的皇帝看到以后，他就被强迫进宫去为公主贵族们效劳了。他在宫里过着囚犯般的生活，行动没有自由，连探亲都不许。他是个劳动人民，看不惯宫廷里的腐朽堕落的生活，也不乐意将自己的艺术劳动仅供给他们一小撮人欣赏，因此他在一个深夜里逃出了皇宫。为了避免追捕，他不得不跑到南方去过流浪生活。第二代是我的祖父张玉亭，他辛勤地劳动了七十多年，创作了作品两万多件，年纪老了，仍然没过一天好日子。第三代传到我叔父张景祜。他生长在国民党反动统治时期。那时作出的泥人没有销路。为了吃饭，为了将祖传的彩塑艺术保留下来，他不得不作一些小泥人到马路上去卖！苦挨着到了第四代，也就是我和我的弟兄们，作泥人活不了啦，只有忍痛放下几代相传的艺术，到化工厂作临时工，赚点钱来维持最低生活。眼看泥塑艺术即将淹没无存，我们张家是多么痛心啊！
    解放后，我们民间艺人才重见了天日。党和政府费了很大的人力物力收集了第一代、第二代泥人张的作品，把它们当国宝一样展览陈列出来，供人民欣赏。同时还妥善地安排了我们的生活：我祖父九十岁了。1954年他到文史研究馆工作，度着愉快的晚年生活；叔父张景祜先在中央美术学院工作，现在中央工艺美术学院工作；张景禧在工艺美术厂任副厂长；我和弟弟张钺都在艺术博物馆工作。凡是改了行的，转了业的泥塑艺人也都重新归队。为了提高我们的创作水平，1957年党和政府让叔父张景祜到四川、云南等省去观察各民族的生活情况，参观了云岗等地的石刻，到景德镇、无锡、唐山等地交流经验，并且传播泥人张彩塑艺术。同时，还成立了天津泥人张彩塑场，派了一些高初中程度的学生来学习彩塑，有计划有目的地培养新生力量，使得彩塑艺术不但得到延续，还有了巨大的发展。
    在政治上，我们也彻底翻了身，党和人民给了我们极大的信任和荣誉。张景祜、张景禧和我都分别担任了全国、河北省和天津市的政协委员，参与了国家的政治生活。1955年，我被评为全国先进工作者到北京开会，见到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席。
    1957年9月，更是我终生难忘的日子，党接受我加入中国共产党，我成了一个光荣的共产党员，从此开始了我新的生命。十年来党花了多少心血教育我，培养我，使我由一个普通的民间艺人成为一个共产主义战士。我感谢党，在新的一年里，我一定要在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，鼓足干劲，创作出更多更好的作品来，更好地为人民服务。（附图片）
