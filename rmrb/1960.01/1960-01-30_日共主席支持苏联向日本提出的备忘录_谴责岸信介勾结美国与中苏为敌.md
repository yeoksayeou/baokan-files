Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement in today's "Akahata" regarding the memorandum submitted by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko to Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Suemitsu Kadowaki. He strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for violating the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration and signing an aggressive military alliance with the United States aimed at antagonizing the Soviet Union and China.

Nosaka strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for colluding with U.S. imperialism, disregarding all the international agreements concluded by the Allied powers after the war to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism, openly reviving and strengthening the enemy of the Japanese people and the people of Asia and the world—Japanese militarism—thereby creating the most serious threat to peace in the Far East since the end of the war.

Nosaka then refuted the anti-Soviet propaganda issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry and Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Kawashima regarding the Soviet memorandum. They falsely accused the Soviet Union of "violating international faith." When referring to the issue of Habomai and Shikotan Islands, Nosaka pointed out that after the signing of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the United States enjoys the right to freely establish military bases in any part of Japan. If the Soviet Union were to hand over Habomai and Shikotan Islands to Japan now, they would immediately become U.S. "bases for northward advance," which would mean establishing a new and dangerous powder keg at the northern end of Japan.

Nosaka pointed out that the Soviet Union agreed to hand over Habomai and Shikotan Islands to Japan in accordance with the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration, which stipulates that it would be conditional on the conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government completely trampled on this Joint Declaration and issued fallacies in an attempt to shift the responsibility it should bear onto the Soviet Union.

Nosaka also accused the Kishi Nobusuke government of spreading deceptive propaganda about trying to open up Japan-China relations while establishing a Japan-U.S. military alliance aimed at antagonizing the Soviet Union and China. He pointed out that the Japanese Communist Party has repeatedly warned the Kishi Nobusuke government that revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" would put Japan's international position in a very dangerous state. As expected, Japan's great neighbor—the Soviet Union—lodged a serious protest with Japan regarding the conclusion of the new military alliance treaty between Japan and the United States. Nosaka called on the Japanese people to further carry out the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," and at the same time, to strive for the establishment of friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and China based on adherence to international faith.

### 日共主席支持苏联向日本提出的备忘录  谴责岸信介勾结美国与中苏为敌

    日共主席支持苏联向日本提出的备忘录
    谴责岸信介勾结美国与中苏为敌
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本共产党主席野坂参三今天在“赤旗报”上就苏联外交部长葛罗米柯向日本驻苏联大使门胁季光递交的备忘录发表谈话，强烈谴责岸信介政府违背日苏联合宣言，同美国签订以苏联和中国为敌的侵略性军事同盟。
    野坂强烈谴责岸信介政府勾结美帝国主义，不顾战后同盟国为防止日本军国主义复活而缔结的一切国际协定，公然复活和加强日本人民以及亚洲和全世界人民的敌人——日本军国主义，从而造成了战后以来对远东和平的最严重的威胁。
    野坂接着驳斥了日本外务省和自由民主党干事长川岛就苏联备忘录发出的煽动反苏的宣传。他们诬蔑苏联“违背国际信义”。野坂在谈到齿舞群岛和色丹岛的问题时指出，在签订新的日美“安全条约”以后，美国享有自由在日本的任何地区建立军事基地的权利，如果苏联现在就把齿舞群岛和色丹岛交给日本，它们将立即变成美国的“北进基地”，这意味着在日本的北端建立起新的危险的火药库。
    野坂指出，苏联是根据日苏联合宣言答应把齿舞群岛和色丹岛交给日本的，宣言规定要以日苏两国间缔结和约为条件。而岸信介政府完全蹂躏了这项联合宣言，并且发表谬论，企图把它应该承担的责任转嫁到苏联身上。
    野坂还指责岸信介政府在建立以苏中两国为敌的日美军事同盟的同时，散布它将设法打开日中关系的欺骗性宣传。他指出，日本共产党不止一次地警告岸信介政府：修改日美“安全条约”，将使日本的国际地位陷入非常危险的状态中。果然，日本伟大的邻国——苏联就日美缔结新的军事同盟条约向日本提出了严重抗议。野坂号召日本人民进一步开展阻止批准新的“安全条约”的斗争，同时为建立以遵守国际信义为基础的日本同苏联和中国的友好关系而奋斗。
