    Strive for Zero Defectives
    Fight for "Zero"! Achieving zero defectives, zero rework, and zero accidents is a militant slogan to mobilize the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses, and to complete production tasks more, faster, better, and more economically. No defectives means great savings and ensures high output. No defectives means producing more and better products in a unit of time with the least amount of raw materials, fuel, manpower, equipment, and capital. No defective rework allows more manpower to be used to increase production. In this sense, improving quality and eliminating defectives means increasing quantity and reducing consumption, which is the dialectical unity of more, faster, better, and more economical. The practice of Wuhan Machine Tool Accessories Factory fully proves this point.

    Fighting for "Zero" and achieving zero defectives, zero rework, and zero accidents is also the most ambitious goal and a driving force to encourage the broad masses of workers to exert greater efforts, strive for the upstream, constantly liberate their minds, and constantly create higher production records.

    Fighting for "Zero" and achieving zero defectives, zero rework, and zero accidents is also a victory of collectivism. In a factory where 10,510 parts circulate through the workshop in one day and night, undergoing 16,144 processes, it is very difficult to achieve zero defectives in the entire factory. Weakening any link will undermine the whole. The workers of Wuhan Machine Tool Accessories Factory learned the style of Ma Xuelei, demonstrated the spirit of communist collaboration, cared for the collective, safeguarded the collective honor, consciously abided by discipline and regulations, and launched a competition craze of "comparing, learning, catching up, and helping," forming the entire factory into a unified, sound, combat-ready, and organic whole, thus creating the miracle of maintaining a "below-zero" defective rate in the mechanical processing of the entire factory for more than twenty days and nights. This also means an improvement in the level of enterprise management and production, reflecting the achievements of the comprehensive leap forward in enterprise work.

    How can we achieve a "below-zero" defective rate and strive for an all-round victory of high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safety? According to the experience of Wuhan Machine Tool Accessories Factory, the first thing is to put politics in command, boldly mobilize the masses, and launch a large-scale mass movement. The experience of Wuhan Machine Tool Accessories Factory proves that without putting politics in command and without launching a large-scale mass movement, it is impossible to rapidly reduce defectives. Before the great battle of August and September last year, the defective rate of this factory was relatively high. At that time, they also started from rules and regulations to reduce the defective rate, but the results were not significant. Once the thought of the General Line was put in command and the masses were mobilized to launch a large-scale mass movement, it immediately took effect and the situation changed.

    We believe that the experience of Wuhan Machine Tool Accessories Factory has great significance for universal promotion. If Wuhan Machine Tool Accessories Factory and many factories in the Wuhan Municipal Machinery and Electrical System can achieve zero defectives, other factories can also achieve zero defectives. With such great ambition and far-reaching goals, even if it is not possible to eliminate defectives in the long run, it is possible to minimize them to the greatest extent. Under the encouragement of such slogans, the production level of enterprises can be improved more quickly, and more and better products can be produced in the continuous leap forward of 1960 to meet the needs of the country.

### 力争无废品

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    力争无废品
    为“零”而战！实现无废品，无返工，无事故，是调动群众创造性、积极性，更多更快更好更省地完成生产任务的一个战斗性口号。没有废品就是很大的节约，就能保证高产。没有废品，这意味着在单位时间内，以最少的原料、燃料、人力、设备、资金，生产更多更好的产品。没有废品返工，就可以把更多的人力用来增加生产。从这个意义上说，提高质量，消灭废品，就是增加数量，降低消耗，是多快好省辩证的统一。武汉机床附件厂的实践也充分证明了这点。
    为“零”而战，实现无废品、无返工、无事故也是一个最远大的奋斗目标，是鼓舞广大职工鼓足更大干劲，力争上游，不断解放思想，不断创造更高的生产纪录的动力。
    为“零”而战，实现无废品、无返工、无事故，也是集体主义精神的胜利。在一个一昼夜有一万零五百一十个零件，经过一万六千一百四十四道工序在车间周转的工厂，能做到全厂无废品是很不容易的，任何一个环节的削弱都会破坏整体。武汉机床附件厂的职工学习马学礼风格，发挥共产主义大协作精神，人人关心集体，维护集体荣誉，自觉地遵守纪律制度，掀起“比、学、赶、帮”的竞赛热潮，把全厂组成一个统一的健全的战斗的有机整体，从而创造了二十多个昼夜全厂机械加工废品率保持在“零下”的奇迹。这也意味着企业管理水平和生产水平的提高，体现了企业工作全面跃进的成果。
    怎样才能实现废品率达到“零下”，争取高产、优质、低耗、安全满堂红的胜利呢？根据武汉机床附件厂的经验，首先要政治挂帅，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。武汉机床附件厂的经验证明，没有政治挂帅，不大搞群众运动，要使废品迅速下降是不可能的。这个厂在去年大战8、9月以前，废品率比较高，当时也曾从规章制度着手来降低废品率，但是成绩不显著。一旦总路线思想挂了帅，发动群众，大搞群众运动，就能立竿见影，面貌改观。
    我们认为，武汉机床附件厂的经验有普遍推广的重大意义。武汉机床附件厂和武汉市机电系统不少工厂能做到无废品，其他工厂也可以做到无废品。有了这样的雄心大志和远大的奋斗目标，即使不能做到长远的消灭废品，但可能做到最大限度地减少废品。在这样的口号鼓舞下，可以更快地提高企业的生产水平，在持续跃进的1960年中生产出更多更好的产品，满足国家的需要。（摘自长江日报，原题：“实现高产优质低耗安全满堂红的重大创举”）（附图片）
