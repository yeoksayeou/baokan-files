    A New Step on the Road to Conquering the Universe
    On the evening of January 20th, in accordance with the plan announced on January 8th to launch a series of powerful test rockets into the central Pacific region, the Soviet Union launched the first intercontinental ballistic missile. This rocket, traveling at a speed of over 26,000 kilometers per hour, followed a pre-calculated trajectory across a range of 12,500 kilometers, delivering the model of its final stage to the designated area in the Pacific Ocean. The high accuracy of the new Soviet rocket has once again shocked the world. The success of the new Soviet rocket test marks another new step taken by the Soviet Union on the road to conquering outer space. The Chinese people warmly celebrate the success of the Soviet test rocket program and congratulate the Soviet people, Soviet scientists, engineers, and workers for their new and significant contributions to humanity's conquest of the universe.
    The fact that this Soviet rocket landed in the predetermined area of the Pacific Ocean not only demonstrates that the Soviet Union possesses an infinitely powerful rocket thrust but also that it possesses a highly accurate control system. The landing point of the final stage model of the rocket deviated from the predetermined landing point by less than two kilometers. In other words, when the rocket reached its maximum speed of 7.2 kilometers per second, the error was no more than 0.6 meters per second. This is even more accurate than the Soviet cosmic rocket that hit the moon. Soviet science and technology have added new brilliance to the history of mankind's conquest of the universe!
    After the Soviet Union announced its plan to launch a giant test rocket, it caused panic among the war forces in the United States. Western news agencies exclaimed that the launch of the new Soviet rocket was "a staggering launch." Although figures like U.S. Senator Mansfield and U.S. Naval League President Jameson were still foolishly clamoring to "protest" the Soviet Union's launch of the new rocket into the Pacific and to "shoot down" the new Soviet rocket, even American military and political figures, as well as science and technology experts, could not help but talk about the undeniable high accuracy of Soviet rocket technology in the face of the constantly achieving astonishing success of Soviet rocket technology; estimating how much thrust the Soviet rocket had, how far its range was; speculating whether the Soviet Union would launch a cosmic rocket to Mars or launch a manned satellite; and so on. Western newspapers and news agencies lamented that the United States was becoming increasingly behind in rocket technology. "The New York Times" wrote that the successful launch of the new Soviet rocket was yet another piece of evidence that the United States was doing "worse and worse" in the competition, "Russia has thrown the United States even further behind." This newspaper also believed that for the Western world, 1960 will be the most difficult year in the three years since the Soviet Union launched its first satellite.
    We all remember that more than two years ago, the Soviet Union's artificial Earth satellite flew into the sky, creating the first feat in human history of breaking free from the shackles of the Earth, breaking through the atmosphere, and entering the universe. Last year, the Soviet Union launched a cosmic rocket that achieved the second cosmic velocity and successfully explored the moon, opening up broad prospects for mankind to explore the mysteries of the universe. It is conceivable that the successful launch of this batch of new Soviet rockets will make it possible to launch heavy Earth satellites and achieve cosmic flights to planets in the solar system.
    In sharp contrast to the Soviet Union's test of new rockets for the purpose of peaceful endeavors and for the benefit of mankind is the U.S. imperialism's acceleration of the use of science and technology for the purpose of war. Recently, the United States has intensified the establishment of rocket bases around the world. U.S. President Eisenhower, in his message to Congress, once again blatantly flaunted nuclear "deterrence" and advocated the development of rocket weapons, using rockets to prepare for new wars. Now is the time for the imperialists to wake up! The high accuracy and powerful power of the new Soviet rocket demonstrate that it is a rocket of peace and also the most powerful weapon to defend the cause of peace. The decadent capitalist system determines that American science and technology cannot compete with science and technology under the socialist system. As time goes by, they will be thrown further and further behind.
    The 1960s have just begun, and the Soviet Union has climbed to new heights in the most cutting-edge science and technology. This is a great joy! It heralds that socialist countries will continue to achieve new and greater achievements in the 1960s; the beautiful prospect of mankind realizing interstellar travel is already in sight!

### 征服宇宙道路上新的一步

    征服宇宙道路上新的一步
    1月20日晚，苏联按照1月8日宣布的向太平洋中部地区发射一批强大的试验火箭计划，发射了第一个洲际弹道火箭，这个火箭以每小时二万六千多公里的速度，按照预先计算的轨道，通过一万二千五百公里的射程，把最后一级的模型送到太平洋海域的预定地区。苏联新火箭的高度准确性再一次震惊了世界。苏联新火箭试验的成功，标志着苏联又一次向征服宇宙空间的道路上迈出了新的一步。我国人民热烈欢呼苏联试验火箭计划的成功，并祝贺苏联人民、苏联科学家和工程技术人员和工人对人类征服宇宙所作的新的重大的贡献。
    这次苏联火箭降落在太平洋的预定区域，不仅表明了苏联已拥有无限强大的火箭推力，并且表明它拥有高度准确的控制系统。这个火箭最后一级模型的降落点，偏离预定降落点不到二公里，也就是说，当火箭达到它的最大速度的时候，即在每秒七点二公里的速度中，误差每秒不超过零点六米。这比苏联射中月球的宇宙火箭的准确度更高了。苏联的科学技术，已经为人类征服宇宙的历史增添了新的光辉！
    苏联公布发射巨型试验火箭的计划之后，曾经使美国的战争势力惊惶失措。西方通讯社惊呼苏联新火箭的发射是“一次令人咋舌的发射”。虽然美国参议员曼斯菲尔德和美国海军联谊社主席詹姆森之流，还在愚蠢地叫嚣要对苏联向太平洋发射新火箭提出“抗议”，要把苏联新火箭“打下来”；但是，面对着苏联火箭技术不断获得惊人成就的事实，连美国军政界人士、科学技术专家也不得不纷纷谈论苏联火箭的无可置疑的高度准确性；估计苏联火箭的推力多大，射程多远；揣测苏联将向火星发射宇宙火箭还是发射载人的卫星；等等。西方国家的报纸和通讯社悲叹美国在火箭技术方面更加落后了。“纽约时报”写道，苏联新火箭的发射成功，是美国在竞赛中“越来越糟”的又一证据，“俄国又把美国抛得更远了。”这家报纸还认为：对西方世界来说，在苏联发射第一个卫星以来的三年中，1960年将是最难过的一年。
    我们都记得，两年多以前，苏联的人造地球卫星飞上天空，创立了人类有史以来第一次摆脱地球的羁绊，冲出大气层，进入宇宙的壮举。去年苏联发射的宇宙火箭，获得了第二宇宙速度，成功地探测了月球，又为人类探测宇宙的奥秘开辟了广阔的前景。可以想见，这批苏联新火箭的成功发射，将使发射重型地球卫星和实现向太阳系行星的宇宙飞行，成为可能。
    同苏联试验新火箭为和平事业和人类造福的目的形成尖锐对照的，是美帝国主义加紧把科学技术用于战争的目的。最近时期，美国加紧地在世界各地建立火箭基地，美国总统艾森豪威尔在致国会的咨文中就又一次公然炫耀核“威慑力量”，鼓吹发展火箭武器，利用火箭准备新战争。现在是帝国主义应该清醒的时候了！苏联新火箭的高度准确性和强大的威力，表明了它是和平的火箭，也是保卫和平事业的最强有力的武器。腐朽的资本主义制度决定了美国的科学技术是赛不过社会主义制度下的科学技术的。随着时间的消逝，它们会被抛得越来越远。
    二十世纪的六十年代刚开始，苏联在最尖端科学技术方面又攀登上了新的高峰。这是一件大喜事！它预示着社会主义国家在六十年代里将不断获得新的更大成就；人类实现星际旅行的美丽前景已经在望！
