Regarding a few views on "Modular" Machine Tools
The General Branch Committee of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Harbin Institute of Technology

Editor's Note: "Modular" machine tools are a new phenomenon that emerged during the Great Leap Forward. The creators of this type of machine tool – Harbin Machine United Machinery Factory – have, through a year of practice, developed this machine tool further. The faculty and students of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Harbin Institute of Technology have studied this machine tool and put forward some of their views. This article is for the reference of comrades studying this issue.

The Party's guideline for scientific research work is to proceed from the needs of socialist construction, occupy and develop the most cutting-edge science and technology in the scientific field, so as to continuously promote the continued leap forward of the entire social production. In accordance with this spirit, our department's machine tool design and mechanical manufacturing technology majors have conducted research on "modular" machine tools.

"Modular" is a New Thing

In 1958, under the conditions of no large factory buildings, no large machine tools, no large cranes, and no large steel casting equipment, the workers of Harbin Machine United Machinery Factory successfully completed various heavy production tasks and realized a great leap forward in production. One of the important reasons for achieving the above results was the creation of "modular" machine tools through a piecing-together method. The structure of this type of machine tool is very similar to the building blocks that children play with. As soon as the "modular" machine tool appeared, it attracted great attention from our department's machine tool design major. From October to November 1958, 50 teachers and students were sent to the Machine United Machinery Factory to learn from the workers as teachers and work alongside them. At the same time, under the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, they conducted a comprehensive and systematic summary and analysis of various "modular" machine tools in the factory, summarized and compiled schematic diagrams of various structures, and made systematic explanations, which were compiled into a book. Through repeated learning from the workers and summarizing experience, we deeply realized that modular machine tools are a new thing with great development prospects.

In-depth Research and Exploration of Applicable Scope

From November 1958 to February 1959, in order to make the cooperation between the school and the factory closer, our school successively sent more than 80 teachers and students, leading cadres from the factory, technicians, and workers to form a mechanical academy that combined five aspects, and the factory and the school respectively appointed presidents and vice presidents. Through joint efforts, the final design of the "modular" machine tool structure was completed, a reasonable modular scheme (piecing scheme) was selected, and consideration was given to how to improve the working performance of the modular machine tool (such as short modular time, high production efficiency, high precision, and good processing technology). After a series of research and analysis, a set of "modular" machine tools composed of nine major components was finally designed and manufactured. These nine major components can be built into eleven types of machine tools such as lathes, milling machines, drilling machines, planers, and boring machines. These eleven types of machine tools have proven to be successful after a year of production practice. After that, from March to November 1959, the machine tool design major successively sent more than 60 teachers and students to conduct further research work. The main research task in this stage was how to use "modular" machine tools to replace my country's existing heavy machine tool system. To this end, we investigated the use of heavy machine tools in my country and referred to the materials of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Germany and other countries. Through this research, we further realized that there are many unreasonable aspects in the design, manufacturing, and use of my country's existing heavy machine tool system, while "modular" machine tools have greater advantages. In order to seek further confirmation, we took the 650 rolling mill as a typical object, and completed the design of a set of large "modular" machine tools at the end of July 1959. It is composed of thirteen components and can be built into six types of large machine tools such as horizontal lathes, boring machines, milling machines, and milling herringbone gears. The successful design and trial production of this set of large "modular" machine tools is a great leap forward in the research of "modular" machine tools. The entire set of "modular" parts has only 1,500 pieces, but for processing the 650 rolling mill, it plays a role equivalent to six heavy general-purpose machine tools (these six general-purpose machine tools have about 6,000 parts). In this way, "modular" machine tools began to enter the ranks of my country's heavy machine tools.

"Modular" Serves Agriculture

In order to broaden the use of "modular" machine tools, we have recently focused on studying the issue of machine tool equipment in rural mechanization. Our department's machine tool design major has made great efforts and designed simple machine tools for counties (federations of cooperatives) and people's communes. Recently, we investigated the situation in six counties in Heilongjiang Province and believed that equipping rural machinery industries with "modular" machine tools is a matter with far-reaching impact. To this end, starting from November last year, 15 teachers and students were selected to design three different schemes of small "modular" machine tools in half a month, and one of the sets was successfully trial-produced in our school on December 30. This set of "modular" machine tools can perform processes such as turning, milling, drilling, planing, and grinding. The successful creation of this small "modular" machine tool provides a new, faster, better, and more economical way to equip rural machinery factories.

Prospects for a Bright Future

"Modular" machine tools are a new thing in the technological revolution. It has strong vitality. The success of this research work may also trigger a revolution in the machine tool industry, and it is possible that a machine tool industry system suitable for my country's characteristics will appear in my country. In the existing machine tools, it can be summarized into two categories: universal general-purpose machine tools and single-process special machine tools. Although universal general-purpose machine tools have a wider range of use, their production efficiency is lower, while single-process special machine tools have higher production efficiency, but their range of use is too narrow. At the same time, the common defect of these two types of machine tools is that the manufacturing cycle is very long, which is contrary to the high-speed construction of socialism. Obviously, such a machine tool system is not entirely suitable for my country's characteristics. We must establish our own machine tool industry system. Because "modular" machine tools adopt the piecing method, they can concentrate the advantages of universal general-purpose machine tools and single-process special machine tools while abandoning their shortcomings; that is, "modular" machine tools are special machine tools for a certain processing process, but for different processes, they are universal general-purpose machine tools. At the same time, the machine tool itself is pieced together from "modular" components, and various modular components are likely to achieve generalization, serialization, and standardization, which greatly shortens the production cycle of machine tools and meets the needs of production in a faster, better, and more economical way. This makes it possible for my country's machine tool industry to usher in a new situation.

Four Aspects for Further Research

In order to achieve the above goals, our continued research work will focus on the following aspects:

First, create large "modular" machine tools to equip my country's heavy processing workshops or factories. Existing heavy machine tools are generally universal, such as gantry planers, gantry milling machines, large vertical lathes, large horizontal lathes, large drilling machines, and large gear hobbing machines. On the one hand, they are extremely complex in structure, have a long manufacturing cycle, and are very expensive, and at the same time occupy a large area of heavy factory buildings; on the other hand, in general factories, the utilization rate (load rate) of these heavy equipment is low. This is because these heavy machine tools have not fully adapted to the characteristics of machine manufacturing. Regardless of any machine, the largest part is its base, which accounts for a small number in the machine, and each heavy machine tool can only process a certain process of a small number of base parts. This makes it impossible to improve the utilization rate of these valuable machine tools. Therefore, a strange phenomenon has appeared in production: on the one hand, heavy machine tools are far from meeting the needs; on the other hand, heavy machine tools in many factories have a considerable amount of time to rest there. Because large "modular" machine tools can realize the "piecing" between multiple types of work, if they are used to equip heavy workshops, the utilization rate of lathes will be greatly improved, thereby reducing the number of machine tools in heavy workshops, reducing the workshop area, and being able to meet my country's heavy machine tool processing needs at the highest speed. From this perspective, "modular" may be an important direction for the development of my country's heavy machine tools.

Second, create small "modular" machine tools to equip machinery factories in my country's vast rural areas. At present, the most needed machinery factories or repair shops in my country's rural areas mostly need to carry out repair and production of small batches of complete products of machine tool equipment. If existing universal machine tools are used to equip them, various types of machine tools need to be matched into complete sets, otherwise production cannot be carried out. However, the utilization rate of these machine tools is extremely low, because they are all single-piece production and repair, and it is not necessary for various types of machine tools to work at the same time. However, "modular" machine tools are very suitable for this characteristic of rural areas. Because a set of "modular" machine tools can perform various processing such as turning, milling, drilling, planing, and grinding. It can also be said that a set of "modular" machine tools is itself a mechanical repair shop. Equipping rural areas with "modular" machine tools is indeed a faster, better, and more economical way to achieve rural mechanization.

Third, create small and medium-sized "modular" machine tools to reasonably equip mechanical processing workshops for batch production. At present, the machine tools used for batch production in my country are basically universal machine tools. On the one hand, the use of these machine tools has a low production rate, and on the other hand, the various performance of the machine tools themselves cannot be fully utilized. At the same time, the manufacturing process of various products must take into account the existing conditions of the machine tools. Because the conditions of the machine tools in a workshop are fixed, it limits the use of the most advanced technology and prevents the production rate from being quickly improved. If the machine tools in the workshop are equipped with "modular" machine tools, the current situation of mechanical processing workshops can be changed, so that the most advanced process methods are not restricted by the conditions of the machine tools, but the "modular" machine tools serve the most advanced process methods, which greatly improves the production rate.

Fourth, create "modular" machine tools suitable for mass production and equip factories for mass batch production. At present, most of the machine tools used in mass production are single-process special machine tools. The production efficiency of this type of machine tool is indeed very high, but there are still serious defects, that is, these single-process special machine tools seriously limit the improvement of products, and the economic losses caused by this aspect are intangible. If we use "modular" machine tools, we can carry out "piecing" in accordance with the improvement of products to promote the rapid improvement of the quality of various products in mass production. "Modular" machine tools also provide extremely favorable conditions for equipping production automation lines. In the existing production automation lines, one method is to automate universal equipment as single machines and then connect them with transportation, but the disadvantage of this method is that universal machine tools are used as special machine tools, which causes waste; another method is to design special machine tools to form automation lines, which greatly increases the cost of automation lines and has a long production cycle. However, using "modular" machine tools to equip production automation lines is very beneficial to the development of production automation lines.

"Modular" machine tools were created by the masses in the technical revolution under the leadership of the Party, but it is still a budding new thing, and it remains for us to systematically and deeply research and improve it to make it increasingly complete. It can be envisaged that the creation and widespread promotion of "modular" machine tools in my country will enable my country's machine tool industry and the machine manufacturing industry associated with it to have a new look suitable for my country. We must, under the brilliant guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, boost our revolutionary spirit so as to climb to the peak of world science and technology in the machine tool industry.

    对“积木式”机床的几点看法
    中共哈尔滨工业大学机械系总支委员会
    编者按：“积木式”机床是大跃进当中出现的新生事物。这种机床的创造者——哈尔滨机联机械厂经过一年来的实践，使这种机床有了新的发展。哈尔滨工业大学机械系的师生，对这种机床进行了研究，提出了他们的一些看法。这篇文章，可供研究这个问题的同志们参考。
    党的科学研究工作的方针是从社会主义建设的需要出发，占领和发展科学领域中最尖端的科学技术，以不断地促进整个社会生产的继续跃进。按照这个精神，我系机床设计专业和机械制造工艺专业对“积木式”机床进行了研究工作。
    “积木式”是新生事物
    1958年哈尔滨机联机械厂的工人们在一无大厂房、二无大机床、三无大吊车、四无大铸钢设备的条件下，出色地完成了各种繁重的生产任务，实现了生产大跃进。获得上述成绩的重要原因之一是用拼凑的办法，创造了“积木式”机床。这种机床的构造很像儿童玩的积木块。“积木式”机床一出现，就引起了我系机床设计专业十分的重视；1958年10月到11月间派出了五十位教师和学生，到机联机械厂一面拜工人为老师，跟班劳动，同时在市委的直接领导下对该厂各种“积木式”机床进行了全面系统的总结分析，归纳和编制了各种结构的示意图，作了系统的说明，汇集成册。经过向工人多次的学习和通过总结经验，使我们深刻地认识到积木式机床是一种具有远大发展前途的新事物。
    深入研究探讨适用范围
    从1958年11月至1959年2月，我校为了使学校和工厂之间合作得更密切，又先后派出了八十多名师生、工厂方面的领导干部、技术人员和工人组成了五个方面相结合的机械科学院，并由工厂和学校分别委派了正副院长。经过共同努力，完成了“积木式”机床结构定型设计，选定了合理的积木方案（拼凑方案），并且考虑如何提高积木式机床的工作性能（如积木时间短、生产效率大、精度高、加工工艺性好），经过这一系列的研究分析，最后设计制成了一套由九大部件组成的“积木式”机床。这九大部件，可以积木成车、铣、钻、刨、镗等十一种机床。这十一种机床，经过一年来生产实践，证明是成功的。此后，在1959年3月至11月，机床设计专业先后又派出了六十多名师生，作了进一步的研究工作。这一阶段的主要研究任务是如何用“积木式”机床去代替我国现有的重型机床体系。为此，我们调查了我国重型机床的使用情况，并参考了苏、捷、德等国家的资料。通过这一研究，使我们进一步认识到我国现有重型机床的体系在设计、制造和使用上有很多不合理的地方，而“积木式”机床却具有较大的优越性。为了求得进一步的证实，我们以650轧钢机作为典型对象，于1959年7月底设计完毕一套大型“积木式”机床。它是由十三个部件组成的，可积成卧车、镗、铣、铣人字齿轮等六种大型机床。这套大型“积木式”机床的设计和试制成功，是“积木式”机床研究工作中的一个大跃进，这套“积木式”全部零件仅有一千五百个，对于加工650轧钢机来说，它所起的作用却等于六台重型通用机床（这六台通用机床约有六千余零件）。这样，“积木式”机床就开始进入了我国重型机床的行列。
    “积木式”为农业服务
    为了使“积木式”机床的用途更广，最近一个时期，我们又着重研究了农村机械化中的机床设备问题。我系机床设计专业曾作了很大的努力，设计了县（联社）、人民公社用的简式机床。最近又调查了黑龙江省六个县的情况，认为用“积木式”机床装备农村机械工业，是一件有着深远影响的事。为此，从去年11月开始，又抽出了十五名师生，用半个月的时间设计出了三种不同方案的小型“积木式”机床，并已于12月30日在我校试制成功了其中的一套。这一套“积木式”，能进行车、铣、钻、刨、磨等工序。这种小型“积木式”机床的创制成功，对装备农村机械厂提供了一条新的多快好省的道路。
    展望远大的前景
    “积木式”机床是技术革命中的新事物。它具有强大的生命力。这项研究工作的成功，也有可能引起机床工业的革命，有可能在我国出现适合我国特点的机床工业体系。在现有的机床当中，归纳起来可概括为二大类，即万能通用机床和单工序的专用机床。万能通用机床虽然使用范围较宽，但生产率却较低，而单工序专用机床虽然生产率较高，但其使用范围太窄，同时这二类机床共同的缺陷是制造周期很长，这是和高速度建设社会主义相矛盾的。很明显，这样的机床体系不尽适合我国的特点。我们必须建立起自己的机床工业体系。“积木式”机床由于采用拼凑办法，所以就能集中万能通用机床和单工序专用机床的优点而摒弃它们的缺点；也就是“积木式”机床对于某一加工工序来说，是一台专用机床，而对于不同工序来说，却是一台万能通用机床。同时机床本身是由“积木式”的部件并积而成，各种积木部件有可能实现通用化、系列化、标准化，这就大大缩短了机床的生产周期，多、快、好、省地满足生产的需要。这样就有可能使我国的机床工业出现一个崭新的局面。
    进一步研究的四个方面
    为了达到上述目的，我们继续进行的研究工作，将集中在以下几个方面：
    第一、创制大型“积木式”机床，去装备我国的重型加工车间或工厂。现有的重型机床，一般的都是万能通用的，如龙门刨、龙门铣、大立车、大卧车、大钻床和大齿轮滚床等。它们一方面结构极其复杂，制造周期很长，价格十分昂贵，同时又占有很大的重型厂房面积；另一方面，在一般工厂里，这些重型设备的利用率（负荷率）都较低。这是因为这些重型机床并没有充分的适应机器制造中的特点。不管任何一种机器，最大零件是它的基体，基体在机器中占有较少数，而每一台重型机床仅能加工少数基体零件的某一道工序。这样就不可能提高这些价值昂贵的机床的利用率。因此生产中就出现了一种奇怪的现象：一方面是重型机床远不能满足需要；另一方面很多厂里的重型机床却有相当多的时间在那里休息。而大型“积木式”机床由于它能实现多工种间的“拼凑”，如果用它去装备重型车间，就会使车床的利用率大大提高，从而减少重型车间的机床台数，缩小车间面积，并能以最高的速度，满足我国重型机床加工的需要。在这个意义上来看，“积木式”就有可能是我国重型机床发展的一个重要方向。
    第二、创制小型“积木式”机床，装备我国广大农村的机械厂。目前我国农村最需要的机械厂或修配站，绝大部分是需要进行修配和生产小批成套产品的机床设备，如果用现有的万能通用机床去装备，就需要各种类型的机床互相配成套，否则就不能进行生产。但是这些机床的利用率却极低，因为都是单件生产和修配，并不需要各类型的机床同时工作。而“积木式”机床却非常适合农村的这一特点。因为一套“积木式”机床就能够进行车、铣、钻、刨、磨等各种加工。也可以这样说，一套“积木式”机床本身就是一个机械修配车间。以“积木式”机床装备农村，确实是农村机械化中的一条多快好省的道路。
    第三、创制中小型的“积木式”机床，合理地装备成批生产的机械加工车间。现在我国成批生产用的机床基本上是万能通用机床，这些机床的使用情况一方面是生产率低，另一方面机床本身的各种性能又不能充分的发挥，同时各种产品的制造工艺必须考虑到机床的现有条件，由于一个车间里机床的条件是固定不变的，因此它就限制了最先进工艺的使用，使生产率不能很快的提高。如果车间里的机床是以“积木式”机床装备起来的，那就可以改变现有机械加工车间的状况，使最先进的工艺方法不受机床条件的限制，而是“积木式”机床为最先进的工艺方法服务，使生产率大大提高。
    第四、创造适应于大量生产的“积木式”机床，装备大量成批生产的工厂。目前大量生产中的机床，大多数是单工序专用机床，这种机床生产效率确实很高，但是也还存在着严重的缺陷，就是这些单工序专用机床是严重地限制了产品的改进和提高，而这方面所造成的经济损失又是无形的。如果我们采用“积木式”机床，则可随着产品的改进和提高，进行与其相适应的“拼凑”，以促进大量生产的各种产品的质量迅速提高。“积木式”机床对于装备生产自动线也提供了极其有利的条件。现有的生产自动线，一种是将万能通用设备单机自动化后再用运装联接起来，这种办法的缺点是使万能机床当作专用机床用，这就造成浪费；另一种办法是设计专用机床组成自动线，这会使自动线的成本大大提高，并且生产周期很长。而用“积木式”机床来装备生产自动线，则大大有利于生产自动线的发展。
    “积木式”机床是在党的领导下，大搞群众性的技术革命创造出来的，但它终究是一件新事物的萌芽，使之日渐完备起来，还有待我们系统深入地研究、提高。可以设想，“积木式”机床在我国的创制和广泛的推行，将使我国的机床工业和与其相联系的机器制造工业有可能出现一个适合我国的新面貌。我们必须在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，鼓足革命干劲，以便在机床工业方面攀登上世界科学技术高峰。
