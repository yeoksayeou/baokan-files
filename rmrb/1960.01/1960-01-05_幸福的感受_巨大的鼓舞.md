The feeling of happiness, great encouragement
By Zha Xi Yang Ji, worker at the Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Farm, delegate to the National Congress of Heroes

With immense excitement, I report to the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the brothers and sisters on all fronts of production about the situation after my return to Lhasa.

Tibet is my hometown. I love our great motherland, and I also love the new Tibet, where the serfs have been emancipated after the victory of the suppression of the rebellion. Currently, Lhasa is even more beautiful and youthful than it was when I left a few months ago: new buildings are rising one after another, the streets are cleaner than before, and there is a joyful scene of peaceful construction everywhere. This cannot but remind me of the past life:

Before 1955, in my hometown—the Takong area of Tibet—I lived like a beast of burden all year round, under the cruel exploitation and oppression of the reactionary landlords. The situation then was vastly different from now. At that time, I really couldn't survive, so I found the People's Liberation Army. They helped me break away from the shackles of the lords and join the workforce. Later, I continuously received education and care from the Party, which made me truly realize that the Communist Party is the savior of the broad masses of working people in Tibet, and that the people of Tibet can only achieve complete liberation by following the Communist Party. Therefore, I became more energetic in my work and was repeatedly rated as a model. At the same time, I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China, and my life has also greatly improved. I know that this happy life was brought to me by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, so how can I not work hard in production!

In 1959, the production team I led was in charge of vegetable production. I was unfamiliar with vegetable growing, but I realized that this was a task assigned to me by the Party organization, so I had great confidence. Thanks to the unity of all the workers in the team, we finally completed the task assigned by the Party.

In my team, there was a naughty girl named Yu Zhen, who would quarrel with people in whatever team she was in, causing disunity, and she didn't put much effort into her work. In order to help Yu Zhen, I approached her in life, cared for her, helped her, and constantly conducted political and ideological education for her, explaining to her the stark differences between life before and after liberation, and repeatedly explaining to her that disunity is detrimental to both work and production. Yu Zhen gradually changed and not only did her own work well, but she could also take the initiative to help others.

My achievements at work are not significant, but the Party and the people have given me great honor by selecting me to attend the National Congress of Heroes. Having only recently escaped the life of a serf, I once again realized the greatness, loveliness, and bright future of our motherland through this meeting. What is even more unforgettable for me is that the Party and state leaders, Chairman Liu and Premier Zhou, personally received us amidst their busy schedules, and inquired with concern about my life and work situation.

All the staff of our farm, in response to the Party's call, are vigorously engaged in sideline occupations, building roads, accumulating fertilizer, building factories, etc., striving to hand over more profits to the state.

On the basis of the victorious completion of democratic reforms, the people of Tibet will usher in a new and better leap forward in production. Our farm will do a good job in all aspects under the leadership of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region. I am determined to complete the tasks assigned to me by the higher authorities with practical actions.

    幸福的感受  巨大的鼓舞
    群英会代表拉萨农业试验场工人  札喜洋季
    我以万分激动的心情，向党中央、毛主席和全国各个生产战线上的兄弟姊妹们汇报我回到拉萨后的情况。
    西藏是我的故乡，我爱我们伟大的祖国，也爱平叛胜利以后、农奴得到翻身的新西藏。目前，拉萨比我离开时的前几个月更加美丽年轻了：新的建筑物一幢幢耸立起来了，街道比过去整洁了，到处是一片和平建设的欢乐景象。这不能不使我想起了过去的生活：
    1955年以前，我在我的家乡——西藏塔工地区，终年在反动地主残酷剥削压榨下过着牛马般的生活，那时的情景，和现在相比，真有天壤之别。那时，我实在生活不下去了，找到了解放军，他们帮助我脱离了领主的束缚，参加了工作。以后，又不断地受到党的教育和关怀，使我真正认识到共产党是西藏广大劳动人民的救命恩人，西藏人民要获得彻底解放只有跟着共产党走。因此，我在工作上的劲头大了，先后几次被评为模范，同时光荣地参加了中国共产党，我的生活也有了很大的改善。我知道，这种幸福生活是共产党和毛主席带给我的，我怎能不好好劳动生产呢！
    1959年，由我领导的生产小组管理蔬菜生产。我对种菜工作很生疏，但是认识到这是党组织交给我的任务，所以信心很大，由于团结全组工人，终于完成了党交给的任务。
    在我这个小组里，有个调皮姑娘玉珍，她到哪一个组就跟哪一个组的人吵架，闹不团结，在工作上不卖力气。为了帮助玉珍，我在生活上接近她，关心她、帮助她，不断地对她进行政治思想教育，把解放前后生活的鲜明差别讲给她听，反复地向她说明不团结对工作和生产都是不利的。玉珍逐渐转变了，不但自己的工作搞得好，还能主动地帮助其他人。
    我在工作上的成绩并不显著，但党和人民给予了我极大的荣誉，选我出席了全国群英会。刚刚摆脱农奴生活不久的我，通过这次会议又一次认识到我们祖国的伟大可爱和前途的光芒万丈。更使我终生难以忘怀的是，党和国家的领导人刘主席、周总理在百忙中亲自接见了我们，关切地询问我的生活和工作情况。
    我们场的全体职工，响应党的号召，正轰轰烈烈地大搞副业、修公路、积肥、盖厂房等，力争给国家上缴更多的利润。
    西藏人民在胜利完成民主改革的基础上，将掀起一个新的更好的跃进的生产高潮。我们场将在中共西藏工委和西藏自治区筹委会领导下作好各项工作，我决心以实际行动完成上级交给我的任务。
