Chen Yi: The Soviet Union's disarmament measures are conducive to easing international tensions. The "peaceful" gestures made by the United States are a cover for its policies of aggression and war. International agreements on disarmament cannot be binding on China without China's formal participation and the signature of its representatives.
The meeting heard Vice Premier Li Fuchun's explanation of the national economic development in 1959 and approved the Sino-German Treaty of Commerce and Navigation.

Xinhua News Agency, January 21st. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held its 12th meeting (enlarged session) on the afternoon of the 21st. After hearing a speech by Chen Yi, Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs, the meeting, after discussion, passed a resolution on supporting the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries on the issue of disarmament. The meeting also heard a report by Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Planning Commission, on the development of the national economy in 1959.

The resolution adopted by the meeting regarding support for the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries on the issue of disarmament stated: "On January 15, 1960, the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed a bill on the Soviet Union's further reduction of its armed forces by 1.2 million troops, and issued an appeal to the parliaments and governments of all countries on the issue of disarmament. This is another major peaceful action taken by the Soviet Union to promote universal disarmament following the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament on September 18, 1959. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China warmly welcomes and supports this peaceful initiative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and believes that this initiative will have a positive impact on further easing international tensions."

The resolution stated: "The Chinese people will, together with the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and peoples, wage unremitting struggles for the realization of comprehensive and thorough disarmament and for lasting peace."

Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi said in his speech that the new disarmament measures and initiatives taken by the Soviet Union once again proved the sincerity of the Soviet government and people in safeguarding peace and their strong confidence in their own strength, and therefore were warmly welcomed and unanimously supported by all peace-loving countries and peoples around the world.

After discussing the significance of the disarmament measures taken by the Soviet Union in easing international tensions, Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that the "peaceful" gestures currently made by the United States are merely a cover for its policies of aggression and war. He pointed out that the ruling circles of the United States are in fact stubbornly adhering to the policy of arms expansion and war preparations; they are concentrating all their efforts on accelerating the development and production of rockets and actively establishing and expanding a network of missile bases overseas; the President of the United States has personally announced that the United States will resume nuclear weapons testing at any time; the United States is still continuing to pursue the policy of dividing Germany and accelerating the arming of West Germany; on January 19, the United States signed a U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty with the Nobusuke Kishi government of Japan, openly reviving Japanese militarism; and the armed forces of the United States still occupy China's territory of Taiwan. Vice Premier Chen Yi called on the people of the world to be vigilant against this policy of aggression and war pursued by the ruling circles of the United States.

Vice Premier Chen Yi also said: "The government of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly demonstrated its sincerity in maintaining peace and achieving disarmament through practical disarmament actions. In the future, our government and people will, together with our great ally, the Soviet Union, and all other peace-loving countries and peoples, spare no effort to wage an unyielding struggle for universal disarmament and the defense of world peace." He emphasized: "China is also willing to unhesitatingly undertake the international obligations that it agrees to assume. However, without the formal participation of the People's Republic of China and the signature of its representatives, international agreements on disarmament will naturally not have any binding force on China."

After Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech, the meeting held discussions, and the speakers all expressed their warm support for the Soviet Union's disarmament measures and initiatives. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution supporting the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries on the issue of disarmament.

Today's meeting also decided to approve the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic.

The meeting approved the establishment of the General Bureau of Foreign Economic Relations as an agency directly under the State Council.

The meeting decided that Assistant Judges of the Supreme People's Court shall be appointed and dismissed by the Supreme People's Court; Assistant Judges of local People's Courts at all levels shall be appointed and dismissed by the People's Courts at the corresponding level. The meeting also approved the list of appointments.

Those attending the meeting as observers included heads of various government departments and members of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    全国人民代表大会常委会举行扩大会议通过决议
    支持苏联最高苏维埃裁军倡议
    陈毅副总理在会上发言说：苏联裁军措施有利于和缓国际局势。美国所作的“和平”姿态是为它的侵略与战争政策打掩护。有关裁军的国际协议，如果没有我国正式参加和我国代表签字，不能对我国有任何约束力。
    会议听取李富春副总理关于1959年国民经济发展情况的说明，批准中德通商航海条约
    新华社21日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会在21日下午举行第十二次会议扩大会议。会议在听取了国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅的发言以后，经过讨论，通过了关于支持苏联最高苏维埃就裁军问题致各国议会和政府呼吁书的决议。会议还听取了国务院副总理兼国家计划委员会主任李富春作的关于1959年国民经济发展情况的说明。
    会议通过的关于支持苏联最高苏维埃就裁军问题致各国议会和政府呼吁书的决议说：“1960年1月15日苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议通过了关于苏联再一次裁减武装部队一百二十万人的法案，并且就裁军问题向世界各国议会和政府发出了呼吁书。这是苏联继1959年9月18日提出全面彻底裁军的建议之后，为促进普遍裁军而主动采取的又一次重大和平行动。中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会热烈欢迎和支持苏联最高苏维埃这一和平倡议，并且相信这一倡议必将对进一步和缓国际紧张局势发生有利影响。”
    决议说：“中国人民将同苏联和一切爱好和平的国家和人民一道，为实现全面、彻底的裁军，为争取持久和平，进行坚持不懈的奋斗。”
    陈毅副总理兼外交部长在发言中说，苏联采取的新的裁军措施和倡议，再一次证明了苏联政府和人民对于保障和平的诚意和对于自己力量的坚强信心，因此受到了全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈欢迎和一致支持。
    陈毅副总理在谈到苏联采取的裁军措施必将有利于和缓国际紧张局势的意义以后，他强调指出，目前美国所作的“和平”姿态，只不过是为它的侵略政策和战争政策打掩护。他指出，美国统治集团实际上仍然顽固地坚持扩军备战政策，它正集中全力加速发展火箭的制造和生产，积极建立和扩大海外的导弹基地网；美国总统还亲自宣布美国将随时恢复核武器试验；美国仍在继续推行分裂德国和加速武装西德的政策；1月19日，美国又同日本岸信介政府签订了日美军事同盟条约，公然复活日本军国主义；美国的武装力量至今还霸占着中国的领土台湾。对于美国统治集团这种侵略政策和战争政策，陈毅副总理要求全世界人民提高警惕。
    陈毅副总理还说：“中华人民共和国政府已经一再以实际的裁军行动表现了自己对维护和平和实现裁军的诚意。今后我国政府和人民仍将同我们的伟大盟邦苏联和其他一切爱好和平的国家和人民一道，不遗余力地为争取普遍裁军和保卫世界和平而进行不屈不挠的斗争。”他强调说：“中国并且愿意毫不犹豫地承担起它同意承担的国际义务。但是，如果没有中华人民共和国的正式参加和它的代表的签字，有关裁军的国际协议当然不能对中国具有任何约束力。”
    在陈毅副总理发言以后，会议进行了讨论，发言的人都表示热烈拥护苏联的裁军措施和倡议。会议一致通过决议，支持苏联最高苏维埃就裁军问题致各国议会和政府的呼吁书。
    今天的会议还决定批准中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国通商航海条约。
    会议批准设立对外经济联络总局，作为国务院的直属机构。
    会议决定：最高人民法院助理审判员由最高人民法院任免；地方各级人民法院助理审判员由本级人民法院任免。会议还通过了任命的名单。
