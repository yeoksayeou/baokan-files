Build More Light Machinery to Support Agricultural Technology Transformation
    Shanghai Makes 1500 kW Simple Generator
    Yunnan Internal Combustion Engine Factory Manufactures New Type Gas Producer
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th – Shanghai electrical machinery manufacturing workers have successfully trial-produced a 1,500 kW turbine generator set while supporting agriculture's technical transformation. After state appraisal, its performance has proven to be excellent.
    The production of this simple generator set has opened up a path for small and medium-sized electrical machinery factories in various regions to universally manufacture small power station equipment.
    This generator set has significantly different characteristics compared to general turbine generator sets of the same type. Its design and manufacturing, as well as the requirements for raw materials, are all based on China's existing conditions, striving to be simple and practical. It eliminates the reduction gear device, solving the difficulty that general small and medium-sized factories have in processing highly precise gears. General turbines require a large amount of alloy steel, while the main raw material for this generator set is carbon steel, which can be guaranteed in supply throughout the country. The structure of the turbine generator in the set is designed to be compact, small in size, light in weight, and saves raw materials. In particular, the main shaft of the turbine generator does not require large forgings at all, but is made of ordinary steel plates stacked together. Other components also use materials that can be self-supplied locally. Factories manufacturing this generator set only need equipment such as a three-ton forging hammer and a three-meter lathe to carry out production.
    This 1,500 kW turbine generator set is very suitable for the current needs of the people's communes. It is estimated that the electricity generated by one such set can supply lighting for a city of 150,000 people, or meet the power needs of two sets of 800-ton small nitrogen fertilizer plants. It can also supply lighting and power for processing agricultural and sideline products for a people's commune of about 50,000 people.
    In the trial production of this simple generator set, many departments displayed the spirit of communist collaboration. After the Shanghai Turbine and Boiler Research Institute, the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Factory, and the Zhejiang Xiaoshan Electrical Machinery Factory jointly designed it, the Shanghai Xinmin Machine Factory and the Pioneer Electrical Machinery Factory, which undertook the trial production task of this unit, overcame many technical difficulties before finally succeeding. Currently, these two electrical machinery factories are further summarizing and organizing the trial production experience in preparation for mass production.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 9th – The Yunnan Internal Combustion Engine Factory has manufactured a Type 2160 gas producer with many advantages to support agricultural technical transformation. It has now been adopted in many places.
    This gas producer is mainly used as power for farmland irrigation and drainage. It has 35 horsepower and can drive an 8-inch water pump to pump more than 230 tons of water per hour. It can also be used to generate electricity and provide power for processing agricultural and sideline products. After technical appraisal, this gas producer has the advantages of high efficiency, good quality, low fuel consumption, low cost, and suitability for promotion and use in rural areas. It is one of the better gas producers currently designed and manufactured in various regions.
    The improved Type 2160 gas producer from the Yunnan Internal Combustion Engine Factory has had its weight reduced from more than two tons to 1.5 tons; at the same time, the amount of alloy steel used has been reduced, and ductile iron made from local iron ore has been used to replace some steel materials, reducing the cost of each unit by 11%.

    多造轻便机械　支援农业技术改造
    上海制成1500瓩简易发电机
    云南内燃机厂制造出新型煤气机
    新华社上海11日电　上海制造电机的职工在支援农业实现技术改造中试制成功一种一千五百瓩的汽轮发电机，经过国家鉴定，证明性能良好。
    这种简易发电机组的制成，为各地中小型电机厂普遍制造小型电站设备开辟了道路。
    这种发电机机组和一般同类型的汽轮发电机机组相比，有着显著不同的特点。它的设计制造和对于原料材料的要求，都是从我国现有的情况出发，尽量做到简易适用。它取消了减速齿轮的装置，解决了一般中小型工厂不能加工高度精密齿轮的困难。一般汽轮机需要用大量合金钢，而这种发电机组主要的原料却是各地都能保证供应的炭素钢。机组中的汽轮发电机的结构，设计得很紧凑，体积小、分量轻，原料材料省。尤其是汽轮发电机上的主轴，根本不用大型锻件，而是用普通钢板叠成的，其他部件也都采用各地能够自给的材料。制造这种发电机组的工厂也只要有三吨锻锤和三米车床等设备，就可以进行生产。
    这种一千五百瓩的汽轮发电机机组，非常适合人民公社目前的要求。据估计，一台这样的机组所发的电，可以供十五万人口的城市照明用电，或者用来满足两套八百吨小型氮肥厂的动力需要，还可以供给五万人左右的人民公社的照明和农副产品的加工用电。
    在试制这台简易发电机组中，许多部门发挥了共产主义大协作的精神。上海汽轮机锅炉研究所、上海电机厂和浙江萧山电机厂等单位联合设计以后，承担这台机组的试制任务的上海新民机器厂和先锋电机厂，又克服了许多技术上的困难，最后才获得成功。目前，这两个电机厂正在进一步总结和整理试制的经验，准备成批生产。
    据新华社昆明9日电　云南内燃机厂制造出一种具有许多优点的二一六○型煤气机，支援农业技术改造。现在已被许多地方采用。
    这种煤气机，主要用作农田水利排灌的动力。它有三十五马力，可以带动一部八吋的水泵每小时抽水二百三十多吨，还可以用来发电，为农副产品加工提供动力。经过技术鉴定，这种煤气机具有效力高，质量好，耗用燃料少，成本低，适合于在农村推广使用等的优点，是目前各地设计制造的煤气机中较好的一种。
    云南内燃机厂经过改进的二一六○型煤气机，重量由二吨多减轻到一点五吨；同时减少了合金钢的用量，又用本省土铁造的球墨铸铁代替部分钢材，使每台的成本降低了11％。
