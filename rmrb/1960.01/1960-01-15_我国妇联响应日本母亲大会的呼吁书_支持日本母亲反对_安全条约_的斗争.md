Xinhua News Agency, January 14th – The All-China Women’s Federation today sent a letter to the working committee of the Japanese Mothers' Convention, representing the women and mothers of China in expressing warm support for the Japanese Mothers' Convention's appeal against revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and extending the highest respect to the Japanese mothers who are engaged in an unyielding struggle against the revision and for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The letter pointed out that "The Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique, disregarding the resolute opposition of the Japanese people and the strong condemnation of peace-loving people around the world, is blatantly stepping up its collusion with U.S. imperialism, has decided to forcibly sign a new U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' dragging Japan further onto a new road of war, making Japan a U.S. nuclear war base, realizing its ambition to expand into Asia, putting the people of Asia in the face of a new threat of war, and creating serious obstacles to improving Sino-Japanese relations."

The letter said, "The Japanese people, especially the Japanese mothers, who have suffered from atomic and hydrogen bomb disasters, will never allow the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to impose war on the people. Chinese mothers, who have personally experienced the pain of war, will always unite closely with you to jointly strive to shatter the war plot of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and defend peace in Asia and the world."

The letter also said, "We firmly believe that the Japanese people and mothers, who are becoming stronger and stronger in the struggle, will be even more united in the more tortuous and arduous struggles ahead, and that final victory will belong to the Japanese people."

The appeal from the Japanese Mothers' Convention received by the All-China Women's Federation stated that Japanese mothers are facing the ominous sign of the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," which puts many of us in danger of losing our husbands and children again in war. We do not want war. We are willing to work with other people in the world to open up a future and create happiness for our children. Revising this treaty means a military alliance between the U.S. and Japan. We cannot allow this unscrupulous practice.

The appeal stated that as we deeply analyze the meaning of revising this treaty, its danger becomes clear. This means transporting nuclear weapons into our country, re-enacting universal conscription laws to send our sons overseas, expanding military budgets, thereby further depriving us of our daily needs, and making our country run counter to the ideal of peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world. This is not only a danger to us Japanese people, but also a danger to the whole world.

The appeal pointed out that despite the government's oppressive measures and large-scale propaganda, the momentum of the Japanese people's movement against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is growing. Japanese mothers are also doing their best to promote this struggle. The appeal called on the Japanese people to unite against the revision of this treaty and called on mothers all over the world to unite to strive for complete and thorough disarmament.

    我国妇联响应日本母亲大会的呼吁书
    支持日本母亲反对“安全条约”的斗争
    新华社14日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天寄信给日本母亲大会工作委员会，代表中国的妇女和母亲们表示热烈支持日本母亲大会关于反对修改日美“安全条约”的呼吁书，并向为反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”进行不屈不挠斗争的日本母亲们致崇高的敬意。
    信中指出，“岸信介反动集团，不顾日本人民的坚决反对和全世界爱好和平人民的强烈谴责，竟明目张胆地加紧和美帝国主义勾结，决定强行签订新的日美‘安全条约’，把日本进一步拖上新的战争道路，使日本成为美国核战争基地，实现其向亚洲扩张的野心，使亚洲人民面临着新的战争的威胁，并给改善中日关系造成严重的障碍。”
    信中说，“曾经遭受原子弹和氢弹灾害的日本人民，特别是日本母亲，决不允许美日反动派把战争强加在人民的头上。曾亲身饱尝过战争惨痛的中国母亲们，将永远和你们紧密团结在一起，为粉碎美日反动派的战争阴谋和捍卫亚洲和世界和平而共同努力。”
    信中又说，“我们坚信，在斗争中锻炼得越来越坚强的日本人民和母亲们，在今后更加曲折、艰苦的斗争中将更加团结一致，最后胜利终将属于日本人民。”
    中国妇联收到的日本母亲大会的呼吁书说，日本母亲们面临着修改日美“安全条约”的凶兆，使我们中间许多人处于将在战争中再度丧失丈夫和孩子的危险之中。我们不要战争。我们愿和世界上其他人民一起，为我们的孩子开辟前途、创造幸福。修改这个条约意味着日美两国之间的军事同盟。我们不能允许这种肆无忌惮的做法。
    呼吁书说，当我们深入判析修改这一条约的含义时，其危险性就昭然若揭。这意味着把核武器运入我国、重新制订普遍征兵法而把我们的儿子遣送到海外去，扩大军事预算，从而进一步剥夺我们的日常生活需要，使我们国家同主张世界各国和平共处的理想背道而驰。这不仅只是我们日本人民的危险，也是全世界的危险。
    呼吁书指出，尽管政府方面采取压迫措施、大肆进行宣传，日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的运动的声势日益高涨。日本母亲们也正在尽自己最大的努力推动这一斗争。呼吁书号召日本人民团结起来反对修改这个条约，并呼吁全世界的母亲们团结起来争取实现彻底全面裁军。
