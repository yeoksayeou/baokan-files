	Bulgaria is Advancing at High Speed
	Yan Qing
	1959 was an unusual year in Bulgaria. In this year, under the leadership of the Party, the Bulgarian people unleashed soaring enthusiasm, overcame numerous difficulties, and achieved a leap forward in national economic development. Industrial production reached an unprecedented high speed in nearly ten years. Although agricultural production suffered from a drought rarely seen in history, the growth rate was historically unprecedented. On December 27, 1959, Comrade Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, summarized the achievements of the past year at the Fourth Special Session of the Bulgarian National Assembly, pointing out: "Our economy has made remarkable progress and has shown a new and higher development speed. Therefore, our path, our route of accelerating economic development, is correct. It has been confirmed by practical life and has become the material force for the development of our society." He also pointed out: "We have no doubt that 1960 will surely be a year of new achievements in the accelerated development of our economy." Currently, at the beginning of this new year, the entire Bulgarian population, full of confidence and high spirits, is following the victorious path of last year, striving for the continued high-speed development of the national economy and for the completion of the Five-Year Plan in three or four years.

	Unprecedented Achievements

	At the two Central Plenary Sessions held in October and November 1958, the Bulgarian Communist Party issued a leap forward call to the Bulgarian people to "complete the Third Five-Year Plan in three or four years." Subsequently, Comrade Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, made a report on "Accelerating the Development of the National Economy, Raising the People's Material and Cultural Standards, and Improving National and Economic Leadership" at the Central Plenary Session in January 1959 and the Third Session of the National Assembly in March, proposing new speeds and scales for expanding reproduction during the period of 1959-1962-1965. This leap forward call and magnificent program immediately became the guiding principle for the actions of the Bulgarian people, and an unprecedented labor upsurge swept the country, with inspiring production victories reported from all over. Diligent labor finally bore abundant fruit.

	According to preliminary statistics, the total value of Bulgaria's social product in 1959 reached approximately 91 billion leva (Bulgarian currency), an increase of 16.7% over 1958. This figure greatly exceeded the original target of 79 billion leva.

	The total industrial output value in 1959 increased by approximately 25% compared to 1958. This growth rate not only exceeded the average annual growth rate (16%) of the Second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957) and the average annual growth rate (10.2%) stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan, but also was the highest annual growth rate in nearly ten years. Now, many basic industrial sectors can produce what old Bulgaria produced in a year in a month or less. The products manufactured by the machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries in 1959 increased by approximately 50% compared to 1958, electricity increased by approximately 27%, and electric motors increased by approximately 53%. Last year, the increase in the mining volume of non-ferrous metal ores was equivalent to 27.4 times the total annual output in 1939 before liberation.

	Bulgaria suffered from a drought rarely seen in history in 1959, but the Bulgarian people still increased the total value of agricultural production by approximately 26% compared to 1958. This growth rate greatly exceeded the average annual growth rate of the Second Five-Year Plan and the Third Five-Year Plan (4.9% and 6.2% respectively), creating an unprecedented high record in Bulgarian history. According to preliminary statistics, the average yield per unit area of fifteen major crops exceeded that of 1958, with the yield per unit area of five crops, including wheat, corn, sunflower, potatoes, and cotton, reaching the highest level in history. Livestock production also achieved great development, with the total number of pigs increasing by approximately 30% compared to 1958, and poultry increasing by approximately 46%.

	Last year, Bulgaria's basic construction developed even faster and on a very large scale, which laid a solid foundation for future continued leap forward. The total investment in basic construction in 1959 increased by approximately 50% compared to 1958, 34% higher than the target set for 1959 in the Third Five-Year Plan. Many new industrial enterprises were put into production. The large-scale comprehensive utilization of the Batak Hydropower Hub Project was fully completed last year. The total power generation capacity of the three hydropower stations of this comprehensive project is equal to the total power generation capacity of all power stations in the country before liberation; its four reservoirs can irrigate more than 300,000 decares (each decare equals one and a half mu), which is also equal to the total irrigated area in Bulgaria before liberation. The construction of East Maritsa, one of the key projects of the Third Five-Year Plan, also began on a large scale last year. This magnificent comprehensive project includes an open-pit lignite mine, Bulgaria's largest thermal power plant, and some other industrial enterprises. The lignite mine will produce 10 million tons of coal annually in a few years, equivalent to Bulgaria's national coal output in 1957. The expected power generation capacity of the thermal power plant is 1 million kilowatts, which can be compared with the largest thermal power plant in Europe. In addition, many industrial enterprises such as metallurgy, chemical fertilizer, cement, textile, rayon, and sugar production were also being built, expanded, or put into production last year.

	With the tremendous development of industrial and agricultural production, the material life of the working people has also been significantly improved. The national income in 1959 reached approximately 41 billion leva, an increase of 17% over 1958, 5 billion leva more than the planned target. Last year, the number of employees working in the material production sector increased by 96,000 compared to 1958. The total retail sales of social commodities increased by approximately 19% compared to 1958.

	Measures and Enthusiasm

	The unprecedented achievements of the Bulgarian people last year were not accidental. These achievements are the result of the Bulgarian people's tenacious struggle under the correct leadership of the Communist Party. In the past year or so, the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee has held a series of plenary sessions to specifically discuss the development of the entire national economy and various sectors of the national economy, fully mobilizing the masses and promptly proposing various measures to the people.

	The Bulgarian Communist Party believes that the greatest potential for developing production lies in agriculture. Therefore, in the past year, Bulgaria has taken many measures in agriculture. On the basis of full collectivization, Bulgaria's rural areas have also achieved the merger of cooperatives, with the original more than 3,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the country merged into approximately 1,000 large-scale agricultural production cooperatives. The merger of cooperatives has created conditions for large-scale water conservancy construction, more rational arrangement of diversified agricultural economic activities, and better utilization of land, labor, and modern agricultural technology.

	Bulgaria is located in a region with unstable humidity and uneven rainfall, and is often threatened by drought. Therefore, water conservancy has become a major link in increasing agricultural production. At the end of 1958 and the beginning of 1959, under the call of the Bulgarian Communist Party, a vigorous water conservancy construction movement swept the country's rural areas. Bulgarian farmers broke the routine and, for the first time, transformed "winter leisure" into "winter busyness," using a blitzkrieg approach to build water conservancy projects on a large scale. Agricultural production cooperatives did not sit and wait for state assistance, but mobilized all their manpower and material resources, relying on their own strength to expand the irrigated area. Over the past year, agricultural production cooperatives have built 612 pumping stations and 713 small reservoirs, and dug 17,000 kilometers of irrigation canals, expanding the irrigated area by more than 1.7 million decares. This figure is equal to the total irrigated area expanded during the Second Five-Year Plan and is almost equal to six times the total irrigated area in the country before liberation. It is precisely because of the great leap forward in water conservancy construction last year that the task of expanding the irrigated area stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) was overfulfilled three years ahead of schedule.

	While building water conservancy projects on a large scale, measures to increase production, such as reclaiming wasteland, building terraces, applying more fertilizer, and deep plowing, were also universally implemented in Bulgaria's rural areas. Wheat, corn, and sunflower fields that previously did not apply fertilizer or applied very little fertilizer were also fertilized with chemical fertilizers and manure. In one year last year, approximately 2 million decares of wasteland were reclaimed, approximately 1 million decares of terraces were built, and more than 127,000 decares of new orchards and 50,000 decares of strawberry fields were opened up. The reason why Bulgaria still achieved a bumper harvest in 1959 under the attack of a major drought is inseparable from the enthusiasm of Bulgarian farmers and the above-mentioned measures such as merging cooperatives, building water conservancy projects on a large scale, applying fertilizer, and reclaiming wasteland.

	In 1959, Bulgaria carried out a significant reorganization in national and economic leadership. In order to combine the initiative of the central leadership, local government agencies, and the people, to enable the working people to actively participate in national management and economic leadership, and to appropriately streamline institutions and reduce expenditures, the Party and the government, based on the principle of democratic centralism, formulated new administrative and economic divisions, reorganized state institutions, and expanded the powers of local authorities. At the end of 1958, the Bulgarian Council of Ministers made a decision on cadres of institutions participating in material production labor. Last year, the Party and the government also made resolutions on education being more closely linked to life and further developing Bulgaria's national education, and on further developing science and enhancing the role of science in socialist construction. These measures greatly encouraged the people's enthusiasm for labor. Movements such as tapping potential, finding tricks, and rationalization proposals were launched vigorously in all production sectors across the country. The example of the advanced Soviet textile worker Gaganova helping backward work teams became a model for Bulgarian workers to learn from. Young workers are vying for the glorious title of "Communist Youth League Labor Shock Brigade."

	Continuing High-Speed Development

	The Bulgarian people bid farewell to the leaping 1959 with a sense of pride, and they stepped into 1960 with greater confidence. The 1960 national economic plan approved by the Fourth Special Session of the National Assembly held last December is a plan for continuing the high-speed development of the national economy. The plan stipulates that this year's total industrial output value will reach 44.77 billion leva, an increase of approximately 15.2% compared to last year, exceeding the level stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan for 1962 (43.843 billion leva). This year's total agricultural product value will reach 24.45 billion leva, an increase of 32% compared to last year; it will also exceed the target for the last year of the Third Five-Year Plan (20.5 billion leva). The total investment in national basic construction in 1960 will reach 10 billion leva, of which investment projects above the limit account for 7.6 billion leva, which is more than the entire national budget in 1949.

	The total social product in 1960 will reach 108.409 billion leva, an increase of 19% compared to last year; this year's national income will increase by 21.5% compared to last year.

	The realization of these targets will mean that the Bulgarian people will complete the Third Five-Year Plan in terms of total social product and national income in three years.

	At the beginning of last year, when the Bulgarian Communist Party proposed the magnificent program for developing the national economy in 1959-1962-1965, the imperialist press maliciously slandered this program as "fantasy," "arrogant utopia," and "unfounded," and slandered Bulgaria's leap forward as "very unpopular." Only one year has passed, and the great achievements of the Bulgarian people have given them a powerful rebuttal.

	Currently, the Bulgarian people are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Party, launching a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy and labor competition, striving to not waste a single minute or second, to complete the 1960 national economic plan in a balanced manner, and to create greater labor feats.

    保加利亚在高速前进
    燕青
    1959年在保加利亚是不平常的一年。这一年里，保加利亚人民在党的领导下，发挥了冲天的干劲，突破了重重困难，实现了国民经济发展的跃进；工业生产达到了近十年来从来未有的高速度，农业生产虽遭受了历史上少有的旱灾，但增长速度却是史无前例的。1959年12月27日，保共中央第一书记日夫科夫在保加利亚国民议会第四次特别会议上总结一年来的成就时指出：“我国的经济取得了显著的进展，出现了新的更高的发展速度。因此，我们的道路，我们的加速经济发展的路线是正确的，它已为生活实践所证实，已成为我国社会发展的物质力量”。他并且指出：“我们绝不怀疑，1960年定将是我国经济加速发展取得新的成就的一年”。目前，在这新的一年开始的时候，保加利亚全民正信心百倍、意气风发地沿着去年胜利的道路，为国民经济继续高速发展，为三、四年完成五年计划而奋斗。
    空前的成就
    保加利亚共产党在1958年10月和11月举行的两次中央全会上，向保加利亚人民提出了“在三、四年内完成第三个五年计划”的跃进号召。接着，保共中央第一书记日夫科夫同志又在1959年1月举行的中央全会和3月举行的国民议会第三次会议上作了“关于加速发展国民经济，提高人民的物质生活和文化水平，以及改进国家和经济领导”的报告，提出了1959—1962—1965年期间扩大再生产的新的速度和规模。这个跃进号召和宏伟纲领立刻成了保加利亚人民的行动指南，全国掀起了空前的劳动高潮，各地传来了振奋人心的生产捷报。辛勤的劳动终于结出了丰硕的果实。
    根据初步的统计材料，1959年保加利亚的社会产品总值约达九百一十亿列弗（保币），比1958年增长了16．7％，这个数字大大超过了原订的七百九十亿列弗的指标。
    1959年的工业总产值比1958年增加了约25％，这个增长速度不但超过了第二个五年计划（1953—1957年）的每年平均增长速度（16％）和第三个五年计划规定的每年平均增长速度（10．2％），而且是近十年来最高的年度增长速度。现在，许多基本工业部门在一个月或者不到一个月的时间内就能生产旧保加利亚一年生产的东西。1959年的机器制造业和金属加工业生产的产品，比1958年增加了约50％，电力增加了约27％，电动机增加了约53％。去年，有色金属矿石开采量的增长额，就相当于解放前1939年全年产量的二十七点四倍。
    1959年保加利亚遭到了历史上少有的干旱，但是，保加利亚人民，却使农业生产总值比1958年增加了约26％。这个增长速度大大超过了第二个五年计划和第三个五年计划的平均每年增长速度（前者是4．9％，后者规定是6．2％），创造了保加利亚历史上空前的高纪录。根据初步的统计，十五种主要农作物的平均单位面积产量都超过了1958年，其中小麦、玉米、向日葵、马铃薯、棉花等五种作物的单位面积产量，达到了历史上的最高水平。畜牧业生产也取得了巨大的发展，猪的总头数比1958年增加了约30％，家禽增加了约46％。
    去年保加利亚的基本建设发展得更快，规模也十分宏大，这就为今后的继续跃进打下了巩固的基础。1959年基本建设投资总额比1958年增加了约50％，比第三个五年计划为1959年规定的指标高34％。许多新的工业企业投入了生产。大型综合利用的巴塔克水利枢纽工程已经在去年全部竣工。这一综合工程的三个水力发电站的总发电能力就等于解放前全国电站发电能力的总和；它的四个水库能灌溉三十多万狄卡尔（每一狄卡尔合一市亩半）的土地，这个数字也等于解放前保加利亚全国灌溉面积的总和。第三个五年计划的重点工程之一东马里查的建设，也在去年大规模地开始了。这项宏伟的综合工程包括一个露天的褐煤矿、一座保加利亚最大的热电站和一些其他工业企业。其中的褐煤矿几年以后将年产一千万吨煤，相当于1957年保加利亚的全国煤产量。热电站的预计发电能力是一百万瓩，它可以同欧洲最大的热电站媲美。此外，冶金、化肥、水泥、纺织、人造纤维、制糖等许多工业企业也在去年筹建、扩建或投入生产了。
    随着工农业生产的巨大发展，劳动人民的物质生活也有了显著的提高。1959年的国民收入达到四百一十亿列弗左右，比1958年增长了17％，比规定的指标多五十亿列弗。去年在物质生产部门工作的职工比1958年增加了九万六千人。社会商品零售额比1958年增长了约19％。
    措施和干劲
    保加利亚人民去年取得了这些空前的成就不是偶然的。这些成就是保加利亚人民在共产党的正确领导下进行了顽强斗争的结果。最近一年多来，保共中央举行了一系列的全会，专门讨论发展整个国民经济和国民经济各个部门的问题，充分发动了群众，向人民及时提出了各种措施。
    保加利亚共产党认为，发展生产的最大潜力是在农业中。因此，在过去的一年内，保加利亚在农业方面采取了很多措施。保加利亚的农村在全部合作化的基础上又实现了并社，全国原有的三千多个农业生产合作社并为约一千个大型农业生产合作社。并社为大规模兴修水利，更合理地安排农业经济的多种经营，更好地利用土地、劳动力和现代化的农业技术创造了条件。
    保加利亚处在湿润程度不稳定、降雨量不均的地域，经常受到旱灾的威胁，因此水利问题成了提高农业产量的一个主要环节。1958年底和1959年初，在保加利亚共产党的号召下，全国农村掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的兴修水利运动。保加利亚农民打破了常规，破天荒第一次把“冬闲”变为“冬忙”，用突击的方式大修水利。农业生产合作社并没有坐等国家的帮助，而是动员了自己的全部人力和物力，靠自己的力量扩大灌溉面积。一年来，农业生产合作社建成了六百一十二个抽水站和七百一十三个小型水库，挖掘了一万七千公里长的灌溉渠，扩大了一百七十多万狄卡尔的灌溉面积。这个数字等于第二个五年计划期间扩大的灌溉面积的总和，几乎等于解放前全国灌溉面积的六倍。正是由于去年在兴修水利上的大跃进，使得第三个五年计划（1958—1962）规定的扩大灌溉面积的任务提前三年超额完成。
    在大修水利的同时，开荒、修梯田、多施肥、深耕等丰产措施也在保加利亚全国农村中普遍贯彻。过去不施肥或很少施肥的小麦、玉米、向日葵地也施了化肥和厩肥。去年一年间开垦了大约二百万狄卡尔荒地，修了约一百万狄卡尔梯田，此外还开辟了十二万七千多狄卡尔的新果园，五万狄卡尔的草莓林等。保加利亚在1959年之所以在大旱灾的袭击下，仍然获得了大丰收，这是与保加利亚农民的干劲，与上述的并社、大修水利、施肥、开荒等措施分不开的。
    1959年保加利亚在国家和经济领导方面进行了有重大意义的改组。为了使中央领导、地方政权机构和人民群众的主动性相结合，为了使劳动人民积极参加国家管理和经济领导，为了适当地精简机构和减少开支，党和政府根据民主集中制的原则，制定了新的行政经济区划，改组了国家机构，扩大了地方的权限。保加利亚部长会议在1958年年底作出了关于机关干部参加物质生产劳动的决定。去年，党和政府又作出了关于教育更加密切联系生活和进一步发展保加利亚国民教育、关于进一步发展科学和提高科学在社会主义建设中的作用的决议。这些措施大大地鼓舞了人民的劳动干劲。挖潜力、找窍门和合理化建议等运动在全国各个生产部门都如火如荼地开展起来。苏联先进纺织女工加干诺娃帮助落后工作队的事例成了保加利亚工人的学习榜样。青年工人都争着取得“共青团劳动突击队”的光荣称号。
    继续高速发展
    保加利亚人民以自豪的心情送走了跃进的1959年，他们以更加自信的心情大踏步地跨进了1960年。去年12月举行的国民议会第四次特别会议批准的1960年国民经济计划，是一个继续高速发展国民经济的计划。计划规定，今年的工业生产总值将达到四百四十七亿七千万列弗，比去年增加约15．2％，超过第三个五年计划1962年规定的水平（四百三十八亿四千三百万列弗）。今年农业产品总值将达到二百四十四亿五千万列弗，比去年增加32％；也将超过第三个五年计划最后一年的指标（二百零五亿列弗）。1960年的国家基本建设投资总额将达到一百亿列弗，其中限额以上的投资项目占七十六亿列弗，这个数字比1949年的全国全部预算还多。
    1960年的社会总产品将达到一千零八十四亿零九百万列弗，比去年增加19％；今年的国民收入比去年将增加21．5％。
    实现了这些指标，将意味着保加利亚人民在三年的时间内，在社会总产品和国民收入方面完成第三个五年计划。
    去年年初，当保加利亚共产党提出1959—1962—1965年发展国民经济的宏伟纲领的时候，帝国主义的报刊曾经恶毒地污蔑这个纲领是“幻想”、“狂妄的乌托邦”、“没有根据”，污蔑保加利亚的跃进“十分不得人心”。时间刚刚过去一年，保加利亚人民的伟大成就就给了他们一个强有力的回击。
    目前，保加利亚人民热烈响应党的号召，掀起了增产节约和劳动竞赛的新高潮，为不浪费一分一秒，均衡地完成1960年的国民经济计划，为创建更大的劳动功勋而奋斗。
