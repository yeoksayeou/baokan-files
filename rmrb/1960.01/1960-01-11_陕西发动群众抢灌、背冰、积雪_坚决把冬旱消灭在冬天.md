Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 10th: Cadres and masses in various parts of Shaanxi are carrying out a struggle to prevent and combat drought, demanding that the drought be eliminated in the winter to ensure a bumper summer harvest this year.

Most areas of Shaanxi Province suffered from prolonged drought last autumn. In many areas, winter wheat and other overwintering crops were sown by combating drought. Since the beginning of winter, rainfall and snowfall in various places have generally been less than in previous years. According to statistics from relevant departments, except for counties such as Yulin, Lueyang, and Ankang, where rainfall and snowfall are slightly higher than in previous years, the northern Shaanxi region has decreased by an average of about 50% compared with previous years, and the southern Shaanxi region has decreased by an average of about 5% to 10% compared with previous years. In particular, in the Guanzhong region, the main wheat-producing area, rainfall and snowfall from wheat sowing to now has decreased by nearly 50% compared with previous years. At present, winter drought has emerged in most areas of the province, and the drought situation in some areas has become quite serious. In the dryland areas of Guanzhong and northern Shaanxi, cracks have appeared in the ground, or wheat seedlings are turning yellow, seriously threatening the growth of wheat seedlings.

Various places launched mass campaigns to prevent and combat drought as soon as the winter drought emerged. Up to now, in addition to irrigating 6.84 million mu of paddy wheat once in the whole province (some have been irrigated twice), methods such as carrying water to irrigate fields, carrying ice to moisten fields, and sweeping snow to return to fields have been adopted. By January 8, more than 1 million mu had been irrigated. The Weihui Canal irrigation area organized more than 1,600 professional irrigation teams, with more than 26,900 people irrigating day and night. After the canal froze, more than 1,700 people were organized to break the ice along the canal day and night to ensure the smooth flow of the canal water. For fields that could not be irrigated by canal water, ice was carried for irrigation. At present, the entire irrigation area has irrigated more than 559,400 mu of wheat fields and reserved cotton fields, more than double the amount irrigated in the same period last year. Sanyuan County originally planned to irrigate only 520,000 mu before the Spring Festival, but later adopted the method of using five waters (canal water, well water, river water, stored water, and low water) simultaneously, and combining drawing, lifting, carrying, and splashing. By January 3, more than 545,000 mu had been irrigated. In the frozen Yulin area, after it snowed on December 19 last year, more than 250,000 mu of snow has been swept to the fields.

In the face of drought, various places have accelerated the progress of water conservancy construction, and many water conservancy projects have achieved simultaneous construction and irrigation. Among the eight medium-sized water conservancy projects built in Pucheng County this time, six have been put into irrigation, and more than 20,000 mu have been irrigated by the 1st. While trying every means to rush irrigation, various places are also seizing the time to carry out soil moisture conservation measures such as weeding, loosening the soil, and harrowing. As of January 5, more than 11 million mu of wheat fields in the province have been winter-cultivated, accounting for 46.3% of the total wheat field area.

Party organizations at all levels in the province have vigorously strengthened the organizational leadership and ideological leadership for drought prevention and drought resistance, and have paid special attention to overcoming the paralyzing thoughts and slack emotions of some cadres and the masses. At a recent telephone conference, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee called on all localities to take out the energy of last year's drought resistance to ensure autumn harvest, fight hard for half a month, and resolutely eliminate the drought in winter. The Provincial Party Committee focused on the Guanzhong area, the main summer crop producing area of the province, with the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and the Governor dividing up the area and contracting the work to strengthen specific guidance. All localities have also taken specific measures to strengthen the leadership of drought prevention and drought resistance.

    陕西发动群众抢灌、背冰、积雪
    坚决把冬旱消灭在冬天
    据新华社西安10日电　陕西各地群众开展防旱抗旱斗争，要求把旱象消灭在冬天，确保今年夏季大丰收。
    陕西省绝大部分地区去年秋季遭到长期干旱。许多地区小麦等越冬作物是抗旱播种的。入冬以来，各地的雨雪普遍比往年减少，根据有关部门的统计，全省除榆林、略阳、安康等县降雨落雪比往年稍多以外，陕北地区平均比往年减少50％左右，陕南地区平均比往年减少5％到10％，特别是小麦主要产区的关中地区，从小麦播种到现在，降雨落雪比往年减少将近50％。目前，冬旱已经在全省大部分地区露头，有些地区的旱象已经相当严重，在关中、陕北的旱原地区，出现了地皮裂缝或麦苗发黄的现象，严重地威胁着麦苗的生长。
    各地在冬旱露头的时候就展开了群众性的防旱抗旱斗争。到目前，全省除了已经给六百八十四万亩水地小麦灌一次水（有些已灌过两次）以外，并且采用担水浇田、背冰润田、扫雪归田等办法，到1月8日已经灌了一百多万亩。渭惠渠灌溉区组织一千六百多个专业灌溉队，有二万六千九百多人日夜灌溉；渠道结冰后，又组织一千七百多人日夜沿渠破冰，保证渠水畅流；渠水灌不上的田地，就背冰灌溉。目前全灌溉区已灌麦田、预留棉花地等五十五万九千四百多亩，比去年同期多灌了一倍以上。三原县原计划春节前只灌五十二万亩，后来采取五水（渠水、井水、河水、蓄水、低水）齐用，引、提、背、泼并举的办法，到1月3日已灌溉了五十四万五千多亩。在千里冰封的榆林专区，去年12月19日下雪后，已扫雪归田二十五万多亩。
    在旱象面前，各地加快了水利建设的进度，许多水利工程做到了边修边灌溉。蒲城县这次兴修的八项中型水利工程中，已有六项投入灌溉，到1日已灌溉两万多亩。在千方百计抢灌的同时，各地还抓紧锄草、松土、耙耱等措施进行保墒。截至1月5日，全省经过冬锄的麦田已有一千一百多万亩，占到麦田总面积46．3％。
    全省各级党组织大力加强了对防旱抗旱的组织领导和思想领导，特别注意克服部分干部和群众中的麻痹思想和松劲情绪。中共陕西省委在最近召开的电话会议上，号召各地拿出去年抗旱保秋的劲头，大战半个月，坚决把旱象消灭在冬天。省委以全省夏季作物主要产区关中地区为重点，由省委书记、省长划片包干，加强具体指导。各地也都采取具体措施加强对防旱抗旱的领导。
