Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 19th: According to Soviet newspapers, the Soviet national economy is entering the second year of the Seven-Year Plan – 1960 – at an even more magnificent pace. This year, the Soviet Union will carry out national economic basic construction on a larger scale to ensure the further expansion of the socialist reproduction of the country's fixed assets. The total national plan investment for basic construction amounts to 255.5 billion rubles. Among the construction projects across the country, there are 271 particularly important projects on which the state plans to concentrate its efforts to accelerate construction.

This year, the scale of Soviet basic construction will also surpass that of last year, with both the total basic construction investment and the volume of construction and installation work increasing by 11% compared to last year. The total basic construction investment will be 5.7 times that of 1940 and 2.8 times that of 1950. Judging from the allocation of basic construction investment, 40% of the total national investment will be used to develop the eastern region, in order to accelerate the development of its rich resources. In some sectors that are of decisive significance to the current communist construction, basic construction investment will increase even more this year. For example, investment in the chemical industry will increase by more than 30% this year compared to last year, and basic investment in the machine-building industry will increase by about 30%. Investment in the development of the metallurgical industry and the oil and gas industry will increase by more than 20% and 15% respectively.

The expansion of the scale of basic construction will enable a large number of new production capacities to be put into production in the Soviet Union this year, greatly strengthening the economic power of the Soviet state. For example, this year, the Soviet iron ore mining industry will add new production capacity with an annual output of 31.1 million tons, which is more than the total new production capacity added by this industrial sector in the three years from 1956 to 1958. This year, the power generation capacity of Soviet power stations will increase by 6 million kilowatts, which is tens of thousands of kilowatts more than the new power generation capacity put into production last year. The production capacity of industrial enterprises manufacturing rubber, automobile tires, chemical industrial equipment, and power transformers to be completed and put into production this year will exceed the total production capacity added in the seven years from 1952 to 1958. The production capacity added by the sugar industry and the vegetable oil industry this year will be equal to four times and 2.5 times that of last year, respectively. To meet the needs of communist construction, in the building materials industry, the cement industry alone will have a new production capacity with an annual output of more than 7 million tons put into production this year.

Striving for time and speeding up the progress of construction as soon as possible remains an important goal in the battle on the front of Soviet national economic basic construction this year. To achieve this, the Soviet Union plans to concentrate most of its basic construction investment on building 271 particularly important projects that are of decisive significance to the country's economic development. These include 55 metallurgical industrial construction projects, 50 chemical industrial enterprise projects, 19 power stations, 21 machine-building factories, 19 coal mining industrial enterprises, 21 oil and gas industrial enterprise projects, 27 building materials industrial and construction enterprise projects, and 23 food industrial and light industrial enterprises. Most of these projects can be completed and put into production this year. Due to the rapid completion and commissioning of these projects and other projects, 98% of the total national investment in basic construction can be recovered this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 14th: According to "Pravda", the Soviet Union will build a high-altitude hydroelectric power station in the Pamir Mountains. The dam of this hydroelectric power station will be as high as 300 meters, and there is no such high dam in the world at present.

This hydroelectric power station will be built on the Vakhsh River in the Pamir Mountains. It will be the largest power station in Central Asia, producing tens of billions of kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. This electricity will be incorporated into the Soviet Central Asian unified power grid, supplying rural and urban areas of the Tajik, Turkmen, Uzbek, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz Republics.

The Vakhsh River originates from the large glaciers in the Pamir Mountains. The dam of the planned hydroelectric power station will raise the water level of the Vakhsh River by 260 meters, thereby forming an artificial sea 47 kilometers long with a capacity of 8 billion cubic meters in the Pamir Mountains.

Currently, 500 exploration personnel are conducting exploration work in the dam site area. (Attached pictures)

    规模更大  进度加快  侧重东部
    苏联今年基本建设更加雄伟
    帕米尔群山中将兴建中亚最大水电站
    投资总额等于一九五○年的二点八倍，百分之四十用于发展东部，大部分投资集中在二百七十一项重要工程，绝大部分工程今年就可以投入生产，百分之九十八的投资今年就可以收回。
    新华社莫斯科19日电据苏联报纸报道：苏联国民经济以更加雄伟的步伐，进入七年计划的第二年——1960年。在这一年里，苏联将以更大的规模进行国民经济基本建设，以保证进一步扩大国家的固定基金的社会主义再生产。国家计划用来进行基本建设的投资共达二千五百五十五亿卢布。在全国各地的建设工程中，单是国家准备集中力量加速建设的特别重要的工程就有二百七十一个。
    今年苏联基本建设的规模还将超过去年，基本建设投资总额和建筑安装工作量都将比去年增加11％；基本建设投资总额将等于1940年的五点七倍和1950年的二点八倍。从基本建设投资的分配情况看，占国家投资总额40％的投资将用于发展东部地区，以加速开发这里富饶的资源。在一些对当前共产主义建设有决定意义的部门，基本建设投资在今年将有更大的增长。例如，今年用于化学工业的投资将比去年增加30％以上，用于机器制造工业的基本投资将增加30％左右；用于发展冶金工业以及石油和瓦斯工业的投资将分别增加20％和15％以上。
    基本建设规模的扩大，将使今年苏联有大批新的生产能力投入生产，大大加强苏联国家的经济力量。例如，今年，苏联铁矿砂开采工业将增加年产量达三千一百万吨的新生产能力，这比这一工业部门在1956至1958年三年间增加的全部新生产能力还多。今年苏联发电站的发电能力将增加六百万瓩，即比去年投入生产的新发电能力将多几十万瓩。制造橡胶、汽车轮胎，化学工业设备和电力变压器的工业企业在今年建成和投入的生产能力，将超过1952—1958年七年间增加的生产能力的总和。制糖工业和植物油工业今年增加的生产能力，将分别等于去年的四倍和二点五倍。适应共产主义建设的需要，在建筑材料工业中，今年单水泥工业中就将有年产量达七百万吨以上的新生产能力投入生产。
    争取时间，尽快加快建设的进度，仍然是今年苏联国民经济基本建设战线上的重要奋斗目标。为了作到这一点，今年苏联计划把大部分基本建设投资集中用在建设二百七十一项对国家经济发展有决定意义的、特别重要的工程上。其中，包括五十五个冶金工业建筑工程，五十个化学工业企业工程，十九座发电站，二十一个机器制造工厂，十九个采煤工业企业，二十一个石油和瓦斯工业企业工程，二十七个建筑材料工业和建筑企业工程，二十三个食品工业和轻工业企业，这些工程绝大部分在今年就可以建成和投入生产。由于这些工程和其他工程的迅速建成和投入生产，今年国家用于基本建设的全部投资中，有98％还在今年就可以收回。
    新华社莫斯科14日电　据“真理报”报道，苏联将在帕米尔群山中建立一座高山水力发电站。这座水电站的大坝将高达三百米，目前世界上还没有这样高的大坝。
    这座水电站将建筑在帕米尔山中河流瓦赫希河上。它将是中亚细亚地区最大的发电站，每年能生产上百亿度的电。这些电力将纳入苏联中亚细亚统一电力网，供应塔吉克、土库曼、乌兹别克、哈萨克和吉尔吉斯等共和国的乡村和城市。
    瓦赫希河发源于帕米尔山脉中的大冰川。计划建设的水电站的大坝将把瓦赫希河的水位提高二百六十米，从而在帕米尔群山中形成一个长四十七公里、容量达八十亿立方米的人工海。
    现在，有五百名勘探人员正在坝址地区进行勘探工作。（附图片）
