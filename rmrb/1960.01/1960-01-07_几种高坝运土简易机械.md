Several Simple Earth Moving Machines for High Dams

    Power-Driven Climbing Device
    The power-driven climbing device utilizes the large and small gear mechanisms from a Liberation-style waterwheel. Its construction is divided into:
    1. Power Section: Can be pulled by a 7 to 15 horsepower portable boiler engine or diesel engine. The power rotation speed is 750 revolutions per minute, and the power wheel diameter is 40 centimeters.
    2. Transmission Device: Composed of a pulley, large and small gears, rope pulley, wooden frame, etc. The pulley diameter is determined to be 70 centimeters based on the power wheel diameter and rotation speed, reaching 400 revolutions per minute. The wheel center is connected and fixed with a 0.35 cm thick and 50 cm long iron shaft. A 6207 ball bearing is installed 10 cm from the wheel center and placed on a wooden frame. The wooden frame is 100 cm high, 34 cm wide, and 120 cm long. A small gear is fixed to one end of the iron shaft. The rope pulley has a diameter of 30 cm and a thickness of 20 cm, with a spiral-shaped groove to prevent excessive friction during rope rotation. At the wheel center, a 0.35 cm thick and 50 cm long iron shaft is used. A 6207 bearing is installed at the lower end of the iron shaft and fixed to the lower horizontal wood. The upper end of the iron shaft is fitted with a horizontal wood with a 6207 bearing, and the top of the shaft is fixed with a large gear that meshes with the small gear. Through the small gear transmission, it drives the large gear to rotate at 100 revolutions per minute. The rope around the rope pulley rotates at a speed of 94 meters per minute. The wooden frame used for the transmission device should be made of hard wood, and the joints should be firmly nailed with iron parts.
    3. Fixed Pulleys: Install a fixed pulley at the foot of the dam slope and another at the top of the dam. The pulley diameter is 30 cm, and the thickness is 10 cm. 6205 bearings are installed at both ends of the shaft and fixed on a wooden frame.
    4. Rope: The rope can also be replaced by good hemp rope, with a diameter of 2 to 2.5 cm and a length determined by needs.
    This tool can transport 432 cubic meters of earth per day over a distance of 60 meters.

    Lifting, Transporting, and Unloading Combined Machine
    This machine can lift large stones or mud buckets weighing over 1000 catties from a depth of three to four zhang (approximately 10-13 meters), place them on a load-bearing cart, and automatically and quickly slide them to the end of the wooden track, automatically unloading them. The entire machine requires only four to eight people to operate. In ten hours of work, it can lift, transport, and unload up to 120,000 catties of earth and stone, increasing efficiency by sixteen times compared to manually breaking the large stones at the bottom of the ditch, laboriously carrying them to the top of the ditch, and transporting them to the unloading area.
    The construction of this machine is simple, and general carpenters can manufacture it according to the drawings. The specifications and requirements of each part are described as follows:
    1. Lifting Tripod: Use wood with a diameter of 15 to 16 cm and a length of 3 to 4 meters to make a tripod. The base wood should be made of two pieces of wood about 20 cm wide. The entire frame should be able to bear a load of 1500 catties.
    2. Winch: On the left side of the lifting frame, on the two pillars, 3.5 chi (approximately 1.17 meters) from the ground, use hard round wood with a diameter of 2.5 cun (approximately 8.3 cm) to manufacture according to the drawings.
    3. Lifting Rope: Generally use a 3 cm thick large coir rope. In areas where possible, it is better to use a 6-meter long, 12 mm thick steel wire rope for the section that comes into contact with the pulley.
    4. Lifting Upper Pulley: Generally made of hardwood. The axle core is best made of round iron with a diameter of 1 cun (approximately 3.3 cm). If two pulleys are installed, it will be even more labor-saving.
    5. Eagle Claw Hook: Use 15 cm round iron to make two hooks (as shown in the figure). The ropes attached to hooks A and B should pass through the "notch" of the other's hook, so that the grip on the stones becomes tighter and tighter until the stone is lowered, and then the hooks will automatically release.
    6. Transport Pulley: Manufacture it similarly to the upper lifting pulley. It should be installed in the middle of the two wooden track ends and fixed.
    7. Operating Rope: Generally, a 1 cm thick hemp rope is sufficient, to the extent that it can pull the empty cart back.
    8. Load-Bearing Cart: Generally used for carrying stones. It can be made of ordinary wood in a ladder shape. For carrying earth, add a movable box. Install four small wheels underneath so that it can slide on the wooden track.
    9. Wooden Track: Generally, wood with a thickness of 5 to 6 cm and a height of 8 cm that is slightly hard is sufficient. However, the top must be covered with thick bamboo strips to achieve the purpose of being smooth, durable, and wear-resistant. The distance between the two wooden tracks should be about 60 cm. Too wide or too narrow is unstable. The wooden track is best laid on a slope of 15 to 20 degrees.
    10. Wooden Track Opening/Closing Joint: The large section of wooden track near the lifting frame should be fixed to the ground. The two end sections should be able to move up and down.
    11. Active Switch: The very end should be slightly longer so that the center of gravity moves forward, and it can automatically unload. The structure of the switch should be strong and flexible.

    Wooden Belt Conveyor
    It is based on the Wave 54-type belt conveyor and made from old wood. A frame is made using 7x9 old wood, 15 meters long and 56 centimeters wide, raised to a height of 4 to 5 meters. The belt is 46 centimeters wide and is made of five 9-centimeter-wide old belts connected together with small screws. It is equipped with a 1.6-meter wooden throwing wheel, and the main shaft is installed with bearings. The operating method is: one person operates the machine, and six people load the earth. Suitable for delivering earth to the dam, it can deliver 130 cubic meters of earth per hour, increasing efficiency by 13 times.
    (Chanzhi Reservoir Construction Site, Laiyang, Shandong)

    Simple Winch
    The "winch" operates once every five minutes. Each wooden bucket carries 20 catties of earth. It operates twelve times per hour, transporting a total of 112 cubic meters of earth in eight hours. Operated by fifteen people, the average is 7.47 cubic meters per person.
    (Xiangang Reservoir Construction Site, Guangdong)

    Earth Traction Vehicle
    This "Earth Traction Vehicle" can pull fifteen carts up the dam every two minutes, transporting 900 cubic meters of earth per day.

    几种高坝运土简易机械
    动力牵引爬坡器
    动力牵引爬坡器，是利用解放式水车的大小齿轮装置而成，它的构造分为：
    1、动力部分：可用七至十五马力的锅驼机或柴油机牵引。动力转数为七百五十转一分，动力轮直径为四十厘米。
    2、传动装置：由皮带轮、大小齿轮、皮绳轮、木架等部分构成。皮带轮直径根据动力轮直径和转速确定为七十厘米；转速可达四百转一分，轮中心用零点三五厘米粗、长五十厘米的铁轴连接固定，距轮中心十厘米安装6207滚珠轴承，置于木架上。木架高一百厘米，宽三十四厘米，长一百二十厘米，在铁轴之一端固定小齿轮。皮绳轮直径为三十厘米，厚二十厘米，其凹槽呈螺旋型，防止皮绳周转时磨擦过重。在轮中心用零点三五厘米粗、长五十厘米的铁轴，铁轴下端装6207轴承，固定在下横木上。铁轴上端安装6207轴承的横木，轴顶固定大齿轮与小齿轮相吻合，通过小齿轮传动，带动大齿轮转动，每分钟为一百转。皮绳绕皮绳轮每分钟转速为九十四米。传动装置所用木架应选坚硬木料制做，结合处用铁件钉牢。
    3、固定滑轮：在坝的坡脚和坝顶，各安装固定滑轮一个，轮直径三十厘米，厚十厘米，轴两端安有6205轴承，固定在木架上。
    4、皮绳：皮绳也可用好麻绳代替；直径为二至二点五厘米，长度根据需要而定。
    这种工具在坡长六十米的运距情况下，每天可运土四百三十二方。

    起运卸联合机
    这种机械能从三、四丈深的低处，将一千斤以上的大石头或大泥桶吊上来，放在承重车上，就自动快速滑运到木轨的尽头，并自动倒卸。整个机械只需四至八人操纵，工作十小时，最高能起、运、卸土石十二万斤，比用人工先在沟底将大石打碎，再费劲地挑上沟顶、运到卸土处，提高工效十六倍。
    这架机械的构造简单，一般木工都能按照图样制造。现将各部分零件的规格、要求分述如后：
    1、起重三角架：用直径十五到十六厘米、长三到四米的木材，做成三角架，底木用二十厘米左右的木头两根做成，全架要求能负荷一千五百斤。
    2、绞关：在起重架的左侧二支柱上，离地面三尺五处，用直径二点五寸的硬圆木照图样制造。
    3、起重绳：一般用三厘米的大棕绳，有条件的地区，在与滑车接触的一段采用六米长、十二毫米粗的钢丝绳较好。
    4、起重上吊滑车：一般采用硬杂木制成，轴心最好用直径一寸的圆铁；如果安上两个滑车，那就更省力了。
    5、鹰爪钩：用十五厘米的圆铁打成两个钩（如图），系在甲、乙两钩上的绳子要互相通过对方钩的“按叉”内，这样，在抓石块的时候就能越抓越紧，直到将石头放下，钩子才自行松脱。
    6、运输滑车：制造与上吊滑车相类似。要装在两木轨头端的中间，固定好。
    7、运转绳：一般用一厘米粗的麻绳就行了，以能将空车子拉得回为度。
    8、承重车：一般装石用的，可用一般杂木做成梯子形，装土再加活动箱，下安四个小车轮，使之能在木轨上滑行。
    9、木轨：一般采用厚五到六厘米、高八厘米稍硬的木头就行了。但上面一定要敷盖上厚竹片，达到滑溜、坚固耐用的目的。两根木轨间的距离约六十厘米，过宽、过小都不稳固。木轨以顺在十五到二十度的斜坡上较好。
    10、木轨启闭接头：近起重架这一大段木轨要固定在地面，末端两截要能上下移动。
    11、活动开关：最末端要稍长一点，使重心一向前，它就能自动倒卸。在开关的结构上，要求坚固灵活。

    木制皮带输送机
    它是根据波54型皮带输送机，利用旧木料制成的。用7×9旧木料作成架子，长十五米宽五十六厘米，升高四至五米，皮带宽四十六厘米，是由五条九厘米宽的旧皮带用小螺钉结勾一起。装有一点六米的木甩轮，主轴安装轴承。操作方法是：一人操作机器，六人装土。适合大坝送土，每小时能送土一百三十公方，提高工效十三倍。

    简易卷扬机
    “卷扬机”，每五分钟运转一次，每个木斗装土二十斤，每小时运转十二次，八小时共运土一百一十二立方，十五人操作，平均每人七点四七立方。
    （广东显岗水库工地）
    土牵引车
    这部“土牵引车”每二分钟可牵引十五部车子上坝，每天运土九百立方。
