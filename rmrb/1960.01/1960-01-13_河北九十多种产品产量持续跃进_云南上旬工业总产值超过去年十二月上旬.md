Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 11th: The broad masses of workers on the industrial fronts of steel, coal, textiles, and light industry in Hebei Province launched a "cross-year high-yield" competition, starting with New Year's Day, and achieved initial success. As of the 10th of this month, the output of more than ninety major industrial products in the province has exceeded the production level of the last ten days of December last year. Among them, the average daily output of steel ingots in the province increased by 24.1%, the average daily output of pig iron increased by 12.4%, the average daily output of raw coal increased by 8.1%, the average daily output of cotton yarn increased by 1.5%, and the average daily output of cotton cloth increased by 1.1%. While the output increased rapidly, the quality of most industrial products continued to remain stable or improved, and the consumption of raw materials and production costs were further reduced.

In the "cross-year high-yield" competition, factories and mines in various places promptly organized and promoted effective experiences, enabling production levels to continue to rise. Iron-smelting plants in Handan, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, and other regions further promoted advanced experiences such as strong wind, high temperature, and heavy load, enabling many small blast furnaces to continuously create new records of high yield and high quality. The Linshui Iron Smelting Plant in Handan City adopted measures such as parallel connection of double blowers and parallel connection of double hot blast stoves on two small blast furnaces with a volume of 13 cubic meters, increasing the wind temperature from more than 500 degrees to more than 600 degrees, and strengthened raw material management, ensuring that each furnace was fed with fine and well-prepared materials. The utilization coefficient increased from around 1.8 to 3.12 and 4.19, with a maximum of 7.88; the quality of the iron was up to standard. The cotton textile factories in Tianjin City summarized and promoted seven sets of advanced operating methods in fine spinning, doffing, heddle threading, and weaving during technical performance competitions, and most factories comprehensively overfulfilled their production plans every day.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 12th: In the first ten days of January, Yunnan Province's total industrial output value and the output of many important products increased compared with the first ten days of December last year. The increase is as follows: total industrial output value increased by 3.4%, the average daily output value increased by 2.2%; steel increased by 18.9%, iron increased by 29.6%, cotton yarn increased by 6.4%, sugar increased by 272%, cotton cloth increased by 7.7%, coke increased by 6.8%, and cement increased by 17.3%. The variety of steel and agricultural machinery products has also increased, and the completion of various technical and economic indicators is also very good.

    河北九十多种产品产量持续跃进
    云南上旬工业总产值超过去年十二月上旬
    据新华社天津11日电　河北省钢铁、煤炭、纺织、轻工等工业战线上的广大职工以元旦为起点开展的“骑年跨月高产”竞赛，首战告捷。到本月10日为止，全省共有九十多种主要工业产品的产量，都超过了去年12月下旬的生产水平。其中，全省钢锭平均日产量提高24．1％，生铁平均日产量提高12．4％，原煤平均日产量提高8．1％，棉纱平均日产量提高1．5％，棉布平均日产量提高1．1％。在产量迅速上升的同时，绝大部分工业产品的质量继续保持稳定，或者有所提高，原料材料的消耗和生产成本有了进一步降低。
    在“骑年跨月高产”竞赛中，各地厂矿及时组织和推广了行之有效的经验，使生产水平不断上升。邯郸、张家口、唐山等地区炼铁厂，进一步推行了强风高温、重负荷等先进经验，使不少小高炉连创高产优质的新纪录。邯郸市临水炼铁厂在两个十三立方米容积的小高炉上采取了双风机并联、双热风炉并联等措施，风温由五百多度提高到六百度以上，并且加强了原料管理，作到炉炉吃细粮吃熟料，利用系数由一点八左右提高到三点一二和四点一九，最高达到七点八八；铁的质量合格。天津市各棉纺织厂在技术表演赛中总结和推广了细纱、落纱、穿扣、织布等七套先进工作法，绝大部分工厂都日日全面超额完成生产计划。
    据新华社昆明12日电  1月上旬，云南省工业总产值和许多重要产品的产量都比去年12月上旬有所增长。增长的情况是：工业总产值增长3．4％，平均日产值增长2．2％；钢增长18．9％，铁增长29．6％，棉纱增长6．4％，糖增长272％，棉布增长7．7％，焦炭增长6．8％，水泥增长17．3％。钢材和农业机械产品的品种也有增长，各项技术经济指标完成的情况也很好。
