Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th -- TASS Moscow, January 14th dispatch: Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Malinovsky delivered a speech at the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet.

    In his speech, he emphasized that all personnel of the Soviet Army and Navy would welcome with approval the proposal put forward at this meeting regarding the unilateral reduction of the number of Soviet armed forces. He assured the Supreme Soviet deputies that the Army and Navy would maintain a high state of combat readiness while implementing measures to reduce the number of armed forces.

    Malinovsky stressed that the Soviet Army and Navy are not armies for offensive purposes, but for defensive purposes. This army was established to defend the freedom and independence of the Soviet motherland and to ensure the peaceful socialist labor of the Soviet people. Malinovsky reminded that it was the Soviet soldiers who saved the people of Europe and Asia from the fascist plague in the past world war.

    Malinovsky pointed out that under the current conditions, when the threat of war against the Soviet Union and socialist countries has slightly receded, it is possible to reduce the Soviet armed forces. This is in line with the wishes of the Soviet Army and Navy soldiers, who are inseparable from the people. Malinovsky pointed out that all soldiers, from privates to marshals, are loyal to the Party, the government, and the socialist motherland, whether in peaceful labor or on the battlefield.

    Malinovsky said that in terms of technical equipment, the Soviet armed forces have reached a level with the most modern and powerful means of combat. He pointed out that rocket weapons with nuclear warheads are the main armament of the Soviet army.

    Malinovsky introduced tactical rocket weapons and strategic rocket weapons. He pointed out the enormous effectiveness and tremendous firepower of such weapons. He said that detonating approximately one hundred nuclear bombs over a country with an area of 300,000 to 500,000 square kilometers could turn all its industrial targets into ruins, and due to radioactive contamination, it would turn its territory into a desolate and uninhabited wasteland.

    Malinovsky said that this is a terrible weapon of extremely great power and cannot be resisted. It is currently impossible to destroy ballistic rockets in flight.

    Malinovsky pointed out that the main task of the Soviet armed forces is: to repel a sudden attack if necessary, and to immediately give a devastating counterattack.

    Malinovsky finally talked about the job placement of retired officers. He believed that demobilized soldiers would receive care and assistance and work in peaceful labor posts as they did in the Soviet Army and Navy.

    The Soviet Defense Minister said that the government's proposed reduction in the number of armed forces would not harm the Soviet Union's defense capabilities. He considered this measure to be wise and timely.

    火箭武器是苏联军队的主要武装
    苏军裁减后仍保持高度战斗准备
    马利诺夫斯基认为裁军措施明智而及时
    新华社莫斯科15日电　据塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅在最高苏维埃第四次会议上发了言。
    他在发言中着重指出，苏联陆、海军全体人员将怀着赞同的心情欢迎在这次会议上提出的关于单方面裁减苏联武装部队人数的建议。他向最高苏维埃代表们保证，在实行裁减武装部队人数的措施时，将保持陆、海军的高度战斗准备。
    马利诺夫斯基着重指出，苏联陆军和海军不是以进攻为目的的军队，而是以防御为目的的军队。这支军队的建立是为了捍卫苏维埃祖国的自由和独立，保障苏联人民的和平社会主义劳动。马利诺夫斯基提醒说，在过去的世界大战中正是苏联军人把欧洲和亚洲的人民从法西斯的瘟疫中拯救出来。
    马利诺夫斯基指出，在当前的条件下，当向苏联和社会主义国家发动战争的威胁稍稍挪开时，有可能裁减苏联的武装部队。这是同与人民密不可分的苏联陆、海军军人的愿望相吻合的。马利诺夫斯基指出，全体军人，从士兵到元帅，无论在和平劳动中，还是在战场上，都忠于党、政府和社会主义祖国。
    马利诺夫斯基说，论技术装备，苏联武装部队达到了具有最现代化的威力强大的作战手段的水平。他指出，带核弹头的火箭武器是苏联军队的主要武装。
    马利诺夫斯基介绍了战术火箭武器和战略火箭武器。他指出了这种武器的巨大效力和巨大火力。他说，在三十万一五十万平方公里面积的国家的上空爆炸大约一百个核弹，就可以把它的所有工业目标变成废墟，而由于放射性物质的沾染，则会把它的领土变成荒无人烟的死境。
    马利诺夫斯基说，这是一种威力极大、无法抗御的可怕武器。目前还没有可能消灭飞行中的弹道火箭。
    马利诺夫斯基指出，苏联武装部队的主要任务是：在必要的情况下击退突然的进攻，立即给以毁灭性的回击。
    马利诺夫斯基最后谈到了退伍军官干部的工作安排问题。他相信，复员军人将得到关怀和帮助，像在苏联陆军和海军里服务那样地在和平劳动岗位上工作。
    苏联国防部长说，政府提出的裁减武装部队人数，不会损害苏联的防御能力。他认为这个措施是明智而及时的。
