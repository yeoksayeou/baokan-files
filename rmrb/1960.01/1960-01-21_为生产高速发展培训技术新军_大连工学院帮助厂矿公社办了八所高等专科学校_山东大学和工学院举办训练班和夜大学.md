Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 20th—Dalian Institute of Technology is actively and proactively assisting local factories, mines, and people's communes in establishing industrial and agricultural spare-time education.

	Since last year, the institute has been supporting factories, mines, and people's communes with teachers, teaching materials, teaching aids, and instruments and equipment. It has successively established eight full-time and part-time higher vocational schools and expanded the night university affiliated with the institute. The institute has opened more than 20 university courses for these schools, such as Higher Mathematics, General Chemistry, General Physics, and Metal Technology, and has successively sent more than 100 teachers to these schools to lecture in rotation. Some teachers also participated in the founding work of the spare-time universities, helping to formulate teaching plans, etc. The institute's mechanical factory also accepts students from spare-time schools to practice in the factory.

	The party committee and administrative leaders and teachers of Dalian Institute of Technology are very enthusiastic about supporting industrial and agricultural spare-time education. The party committee secretary and some leading cadres personally went to Dasing Shilizi District to help establish a spare-time university. Lei Tianyue, secretary of the party general branch of the Department of Mathematics, Physics, and Mechanics, teaches Higher Mathematics courses for the night university. In order to free up strength to support spare-time schools, many teaching and research sections have comprehensively arranged their teaching forces. Most of the teachers who teach at spare-time schools pay attention to preparing and explaining lessons in light of the characteristics of spare-time education and the specific situation of the students. After class, they also promptly listen to students' opinions and actively improve their teaching methods. The students of the night university affiliated with the institute come from more than 100 factories, mines, and enterprises in the city. Many of them are leading cadres at all levels of the enterprises. They are busy with work and have little time for review. Teachers sometimes take individual tutoring methods to help them consolidate the results of classroom learning. For students who have delayed courses due to official business trips, teachers also use Sundays to go to their homes to make up lessons.

	The spare-time schools established by Dalian Institute of Technology to help factories, mines, and communes have effectively improved the cultural and technical levels of cadres, workers, peasants, and technicians in these units. Kong Xiangyu, a technician from the Dalian Machine Tool Factory who came from a worker's background, has made many achievements in the innovation of machine tool technology since entering the spare-time university. Not long ago, he and other engineering and technical personnel from the factory jointly researched and built an automatic line for rolling gears.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th—Shandong University runs training classes to train technical personnel for industrial and agricultural production. After New Year's Day this year, the Department of Physics of this school held a training class on manufacturing barium ferrite for various prefectures, factories, and mines in Shandong Province, training a group of personnel who can master the technology of manufacturing barium ferrite.

	In order to meet the needs of the high-speed development of industry and agriculture, Shandong University also plans to run radio training classes and lecture classes on general physics and general mathematics, etc., to assist in training technical personnel in various aspects.

	Before this year, Shandong University had successively held a number of short-term training classes and lecture classes in conjunction with scientific research, training a group of personnel who have mastered relevant science and technology for industry, agriculture, transportation, and basic construction. In the winter of 1958, in coordination with the nationwide campaign to run iron and steel in a big way, the school held a training class for iron and steel testing personnel, training 382 testers for Zibo, Changwei, and Yantai prefectures in three months, and established 32 laboratories; and helped these three prefectures establish a relatively sound testing network. In order to support agricultural modernization, the Department of Biology of this school held three bacterial fertilizer training classes in 1953, assisting rural people's communes in solving the problem of fertilizer sources, and trained three groups of more than 120 personnel who can master the technology of manufacturing bacterial fertilizer. After the members finished their studies and returned, they all established bacterial fertilizer factories. Last year, the Department of Mathematics of this school jointly held a lecture class on rational transportation for the industrial departments and transportation units in Shandong Province, teaching courses on "linear programming." The dispatchers of the transportation department who participated in the lecture class have initially mastered the methods of scientific dispatching and applied them to their work.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th—The Night University of Shandong Institute of Technology actively trains technical talents for factories and enterprises in Jinan City.

	The Night University Department of this institute was founded in 1956. It now has two undergraduate majors: Mechanical Manufacturing Technology, Power Plant Power Grid, and Power System, with a study system of six and a half years. The 149 students of the Night School Department come from more than 60 factories and enterprises in Jinan City. Among them, 86% are workers, technicians, workshop directors, and engineers, and 14% are teachers from secondary technical schools and other personnel.

	Since its establishment, the Night University has followed the principle of "combining uniformity and flexibility," taking the undergraduate teaching plan of a full-time university as a blueprint. On the one hand, it maintains the systematic nature of the teaching plan, and on the other hand, it makes appropriate adjustments to professional class hours and auxiliary professional courses based on the characteristics of students having certain production experience and professional knowledge. Over the past three years, it has basically completed the content stipulated in the teaching plan. Many students have directly promoted production and work after studying at the Night University. For example, Li Zaitang, a technician from the Machine Tool Factory No. 2, studied mechanics and mechanical drawing knowledge at the Night University, worked hard, and successfully trial-produced a steel ball grinding wheel, which enabled the planer to realize glazing mechanization and increased production efficiency by two times.

	In order to further develop spare-time higher education, Shandong Institute of Technology has added a correspondence department and single-subject lecture classes starting this year to meet the spare-time learning requirements of the vast number of workers and engineering technicians in the province.

    山东大学和工学院举办训练班和夜大学
    新华社旅大20日电　大连工学院积极主动地帮助地方厂矿和人民公社兴办工农业余教育。
    去年以来，这个学院以师资、教材、教学用具、仪器设备等支援厂矿和人民公社，先后办起了八所全日制的和业余的高等专科学校，并扩大了学院附设的夜大学。学院为这些学校开设了高等数学、普通化学、普通物理、金属工艺等二十多门大学课程，并先后派出一百多名教师轮流到这些学校讲课。有的教师还参加了业余大学的创校工作，帮助拟订教学计划等。学院的机械工厂并接受业余学校的学生到工厂实习。
    大连工学院的党委、行政领导干部和教师支援工农业余教育的积极性很高。党委书记和一些领导干部亲自到大辛实子区去，帮助创办业余大学。数理力学系党总支书记雷天岳，为夜大学讲授高等数学课程。许多教研室为了抽出力量支援业余学校，全面安排了教学力量。到业余学校任课的教师，绝大部分都注意结合业余教育的特点和学员的具体情况备课和讲解，课后还及时地听取学员意见，积极改进教学方法。学院附设夜大学的学员，来自全市一百多个厂矿企业。他们中很多是企业的各级领导干部，工作忙，复习时间少，教师们有时采取个别辅导的办法帮助他们巩固课堂学习的成果。对因公外出耽误了课程的学员，教师们还利用星期日到他们家里去补课。
    大连工学院帮助厂矿和公社兴办的业余学校，有效地提高了这些单位的干部、工人、农民和技术人员的文化水平和技术水平。大连机床厂工人出身的技术人员孔祥玉进入业余大学学习以来，在机床工艺的革新方面有了不少成绩。不久前，他和工厂的其他工程技术人员一起研究建成轧制齿轮的自动线。
    新华社济南20日电　山东大学举办训练班为工农业生产培养技术人材。这个学校的物理系，今年元旦后为山东省各专区、厂矿单位，举办了一期制造钡铁氧体训练班，培养出一批能掌握制造钡铁氧体技术的人材。
    为了适应工农业高速度发展的需要，山东大学还计划举办无线电训练班，普通物理、普通数学讲习班等。协助各方面培养技术人员。
    今年以前，山东大学结合科学研究已先后举办过一批短期训练班和讲习班，为工业、农业、交通运输和基本建设等方面培养了一批掌握有关科学技术的人材。1958年冬，配合全民大办钢铁，学校举办了钢铁化验人员训练班，三个月中为淄博、昌潍、烟台三个专区培养了三百八十二名化验员，建立了三十二个化验室；并帮助这三个专区建立了一套比较健全的化验网。为了支援农业现代化，这个学校的生物系在1953年举办过三次细菌肥料训练班，协助农村人民公社解决肥料来源问题，培养了三批共一百二十多名能掌握制造菌肥技术的人材。社员们学习结业回去，都纷纷建立了细菌肥料厂。这个学校的数学系，去年为山东省工业部门与运输单位共同举办了合理运输讲习班，讲授关于“线性规划”方面的课程。参加讲习班学习的运输部门调度员，都初步掌握了科学调度方法，并运用到工作中去。
    新华社济南20日电　山东工学院夜大学为济南市的工厂企业，积极培养技术人才。
    这个学院夜大学部是1956年创办的，现在设有机械制造工艺、发电厂电力网和电力系统两个本科专业，学制为六年半。夜校部的一百四十九个学员，来自济南市六十多个工厂企业。其中86％是工人、技术员、车间主任、工程师，14％是中等技术学校的教师和其他方面的人员。
    夜大学自开办以来，根据“统一性和灵活性相结合”的原则，以全日制大学本科教学计划为蓝本，一方面保持教学计划的系统性，一方面根据学员具有一定生产经验和专业知识等特点，对专业课时和辅助性的专业课，作了适当的调整安排。三年多来，基本上完成了教学计划所规定的内容，许多学员经过夜大学学习后，直接推动了生产和工作。如机床二厂技术员李载堂，在夜大学学习力学和机械制图知识，刻苦钻研，试制成功钢珠砂轮，使刨床实现了压光机械化，提高生产效率两倍。
    为了进一步发展业余高等教育，山东工学院从今年起增设了函授部和单科讲授班，以满足省内广大工人和工程技术人员的业余学习要求。
