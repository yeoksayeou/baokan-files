The meeting listened to the report by the First Secretary of the Party Central Committee, János Kádár, on the implementation of the national economic plan last year and how to implement the 1960 plan, and adopted the Political Bureau's various measures to implement the 1960 plan.
    The Central Committee pointed out that thanks to the efforts of the working people throughout the country, the task of completing the main targets of the original three-year plan one year ahead of schedule, as proposed in the Party Central Committee's March 1959 resolution, has been successfully completed.
    The Central Committee called on all production units to further launch a labor emulation drive to greet the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the motherland, formulate annual plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and actively develop socialist labor teams. The Party, the League, the trade unions, other social organizations, and economic organizations must vigorously support the labor emulation drive.

From mid-November last year to January 11 this year, another 149,000 farmers across the country joined cooperatives, with a total of 848,000 hectares of land joining. As of January 11, a total of 1,821 villages and towns across the country had fully realized cooperation. At present, the cultivated land area of cooperatives and state farms accounts for 57.5% of the country's cultivated land. The Party Central Committee called on Party and government organs and social organizations to continue to assist the new cooperatives in consolidating their work and helping them to successfully start collective management.
    The Central Committee also studied the Party's institutions and personnel issues in accordance with the resolutions of the Seventh Party Congress, elected four standing committees of the Central Committee (National Economy, Agriculture, Propaganda and Agitation, and Veteran Party Member Affairs), and approved the appointments of the heads of the various departments of the Party Central Committee.
