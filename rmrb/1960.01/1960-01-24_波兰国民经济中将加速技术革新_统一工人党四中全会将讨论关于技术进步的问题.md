Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 20th. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party opened in Warsaw on the 20th. The plenary session will discuss the issue of technological progress in the national economy.

    The report submitted to the plenary session for discussion, entitled "On the Tasks of the Party and the State in Technological Progress," points out that the past fifteen years have been a period of significant progress in technology for Poland, with remarkable development of the national economy and increased productivity.

    The machine-building and power equipment manufacturing industries have developed particularly rapidly. The proportion of machine manufacturing in total industrial production has increased from approximately 7% in 1937 to 20.6% in 1959, while the output value has increased more than twentyfold. The proportion of machine manufacturing in total export value has increased from 2.4% in 1949 to 26.5% in 1959.

    The production of the chemical industry has increased more than twelvefold compared to pre-war levels.

    The per capita power generation in Poland has increased from 106 kWh per person in 1937 to 900 kWh in 1959. This indicates that Poland has reached the level of a generally industrialized country.

    In addition, the metallurgical industry has undergone a complete transformation. The development of the mining industry, especially the mechanization of mining operations, has led to increased labor productivity.

    The report states that, from the perspective of catching up with the most technologically advanced countries, Poland's technological progress has not reached its potential and has not yet met the needs of the national economy. In particular, labor productivity is not high enough in some basic production sectors, and the consumption of materials, power, and fuel is excessive.

    The report points out that the main tasks of technological development in the national economy are:

    (1) To fully mechanize work that is still done manually, and to automate where it can produce the most favorable economic results.

    (2) To install more productive combined machines, adopt more advanced technological operating methods, innovate equipment, modernize it, and fully utilize production capacity.

    (3) To adopt cheaper and more effective raw materials and supplies, and to practice strict economy.

    The report emphasizes that the most important way to achieve technological progress is to equip expanded and newly built enterprises with modern, highly productive equipment, and to adopt the latest technological methods.

    The report states that the ultimate effect of all technological development plans should be to increase labor productivity and reduce production costs.

    The report points out that for the development of science and technology, it is necessary to utilize the experience and achievements of other countries, especially the experience and achievements of the Soviet Union and countries that are building socialism.

    The report points out that the plan for accelerating technological progress stipulates that the most important activities of technical institutions and scientific and technical associations should be to cultivate young technical personnel and strengthen work in the areas of invention and rationalization proposals.

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw. According to the "People's Tribune" newspaper, the total export value of Polish heavy industrial products this year will exceed two billion foreign exchange Zloty for the first time, an increase of one hundred million foreign exchange Zloty compared to last year.

    This year, Poland will mainly increase the export of heavy industrial products such as complete sets of equipment, machinery, transportation equipment, and transportation vehicles. This fact demonstrates the improvement of the production technology level of Polish machinery and equipment. The export of heavy industrial products will account for about 42% of Poland's total exports.

    This year, the top export item in Poland is ships, followed by rolling stock.

    The Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia are the two major customers of Polish industrial products. Due to the strengthening of economic cooperation between socialist countries, the trade volume between Poland and other socialist countries has also greatly increased.

### 波兰国民经济中将加速技术革新  统一工人党四中全会将讨论关于技术进步的问题

    波兰国民经济中将加速技术革新
    统一工人党四中全会将讨论关于技术进步的问题
    新华社华沙电　波兰统一工人党中央委员会第四次全体会议20日在华沙开幕。全会将讨论国民经济中的技术进步问题。
    在提交全会讨论的题为“关于党和国家在技术进步方面的任务”的报告中指出，过去十五年是波兰在国民经济显著发展、生产力提高的情况下，在技术方面获得巨大进展的时期。
    发展特别迅速的是机器制造业和发电设备制造工业。机器制造业在整个工业生产中的比重从1937年的7％左右增加到1959年的20．6％，而产值则增加了二十倍以上。机器制造业在整个出口产值中所占的比重已从1949年的2．4％增加到1959年的26．5％。
    化学工业的生产比战前增加了十二倍以上。
    按人口平均计算，波兰的发电量已从1937年的每人一百零六度增加到1959年的九百度。这表明波兰已达到一般工业化国家的水平。
    此外，冶金工业已经进行了彻底的改造。采矿工业的发展，特别是采矿作业实行机械化，使劳动生产率有了提高。
    报告说，但是，从赶上技术最先进的国家水平的观点来看，波兰的技术进步没有达到可能做到的程度，还没有满足国民经济的需要。特别是在一些基本生产部门中，劳动生产率还不够高，物资、动力和燃料的消耗过多。
    报告指出，国民经济技术发展的主要任务是：
    （一）使至今仍用手工劳动的工作全盘机械化，在可以产生最有利的经济效果的场合下实行自动化。
    （二）安装生产力更大的联动机，采用更先进的技术操作方法，革新设备，使之现代化，充分利用生产能力。
    （三）采用廉价和效果更好的原料和物资，并厉行节约。
    报告着重指出，取得技术进步的最重要的办法是用现代化的、有高度生产力的设备来装备扩建和新建的企业，采用最新的技术方法。
    报告说，一切技术发展规划的最后效果应该是，提高劳动生产率和降低生产成本。
    报告指出，为了科学和技术的发展，必须利用其他国家的经验和成就，特别是苏联和正在建设社会主义的国家的经验和成就。
    报告指出，加速技术进步的计划规定，技术机构和科学技术协会的最重要的活动应当是培养年青的技术人员，加强发明创造和合理化建议方面的工作。
    新华社华沙电　据“人民论坛报”报道，波兰重工业产品今年的出口总值第一次将超过二十亿外汇兹罗提，比去年增长一亿外汇兹罗提。
    今年波兰主要将增加成套设备、机器、运输设备和运输工具等这样一些重工业产品的出口。这一事实说明了波兰机器设备的生产技术水平的提高。重工业产品的出口将占波兰总出口额的42％左右。
    今年在波兰出口中占第一位的是轮船，其次是机车车辆。
    苏联和捷克斯洛伐克是波兰工业产品的两大主顾。由于各社会主义国家之间经济合作的加强，波兰与其他社会主义国家的贸易额也有很大的增长。
