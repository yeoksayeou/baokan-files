Xinhua News Agency report: Recently, the French government announced that it would conduct atomic bomb tests in the Sahara region of North Africa. This provocative action by the French government has aroused strong condemnation from world public opinion.

World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Louis Saillant wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 16th, protesting on behalf of the WFTU.

Saillant pointed out in his letter that France's plan to conduct atomic bomb tests in the Sahara is particularly dangerous to the African people and will hinder progress in international reconciliation.

Emir Fale Ould Omeira, chieftain of the Taraza tribe of French Mauritania, said at a press conference held at the Moroccan Embassy in Cairo on the 15th that Mauritanians, who have been struggling against French colonial rule for a long time, strongly protest France's decision to conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara region.

The Moroccan newspaper "Opinion" emphasized in its editorial on the 11th that "this explosion is a heinous act of aggression that threatens humanity, especially the inhabitants of the Sahara," and is a challenge to all mankind.

The city of Marseille, France, conducted a public opinion poll on the dangerous consequences for African residents of the upcoming French atomic explosion test in the Sahara. Participants in the survey unanimously passed a petition to French President Charles de Gaulle. The petition said: "For the benefit of all mankind and France, we ask you to abandon the plan to test nuclear weapons in the Sahara."

Mrs. Rameshvari Nehru, chairman of the Indian Asian-African Solidarity Committee, issued a statement in New Delhi on the 12th, saying that the Indian Asian-African Solidarity Committee strongly condemns the French government's recent decision to conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara.
