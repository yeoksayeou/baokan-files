    Moving from Victory to Greater Victory
    By Our Correspondents Yang Xu and Lin Hai
          The Scenery is Boundless
    As the working people of Czechoslovakia welcome the New Year with confidence, their hearts are filled with the strong atmosphere of spring, because in the past year, on the road to completing socialist construction, they have created a boundless and beautiful landscape for their motherland through their hard work.
    1959 was the fourth year of Czechoslovakia's Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, and the second year since the Czechoslovak Communist Party put forward its battle call to complete socialist construction. If 1958 was a year of preparation for this fighting task, then 1959 was a year of comprehensive advance towards this task, and also a year of significant progress. The Czechoslovak working people have not failed the Party's expectations and instructions. The implementation of the national economic plan in 1959 was very good. According to the original plan, Czechoslovakia's industrial production should increase by 16% in the last two years of the Second Five-Year Plan, but in fact it increased by 11% in 1959 alone. Labor productivity is growing smoothly, with the average productivity of each worker increasing by more than 8% compared to 1958. Production costs are also gradually decreasing according to plan. The industrial, construction, and transportation plans were all overfulfilled in 1959, and agriculture, which had always lagged behind industrial development, also showed a new situation. As President Novotny said, all of this has created full possibilities for further improving Czechoslovakia's national economic plan for 1960.
        New Look in Industry
    Czechoslovakia is a highly developed industrial country, with industrial production accounting for 85% of the total value of industrial and agricultural output. In 1959, Czechoslovakia's industry not only comprehensively completed the state plan, but also exceeded the original plan by 1.5%. The production of metallurgy and machinery industries, which are the foundation of the national economy, increased by 15% compared to 1958, and their absolute increase in production almost equaled half of the entire industrial sector's growth. Coal production, which had previously been unable to meet the needs of the national economy, not only changed its previous backward state in 1959, but also jumped to the forefront of industrial production. In that year, all factories and mines under the fuel industry department sent good news on December 23 that they had completed the annual plan, producing a total of 81 million tons of coal, which is the world's first in terms of per capita production. Electricity production also increased by 11.9% in 1959 compared to the previous year, which not only greatly promoted the development of industrial production, but also provided good material conditions for national electrification. Some states, such as Prague, Pilsen, and České Budějovice, completed the state's electrification plan one year ahead of schedule, and even the most remote mountain villages in these states had electricity and other equipment.
    Czechoslovakia's good achievements in industrial production in 1959 were not only due to the Czechoslovak Communist Party's vigorous strengthening of the political and ideological education of the working people, which resulted in a general increase in the production enthusiasm of the broad working class, but also to a series of new measures taken by the CPC Central Committee and the government in industrial production, which presented a new and prosperous atmosphere on the industrial front.
    In leading industrial production in 1959, the CPC emphasized the principle of combining comprehensiveness with key points, and gave special attention to some weak links and backward departments in industrial production. For example, coal production had long been a factor hindering the rapid advance of industry. In 1959, the CPC strengthened its leadership over the coal mining industry and adopted a series of political and technical measures, such as strengthening the Party's propaganda and mobilization work among miners and further realizing the mechanization of coal mining and transportation, thus completely reversing the backward situation of the coal mining industry. Housing construction had also long failed to complete the state plan, mainly due to insufficient labor and lack of raw materials. In 1959, Czechoslovakia supplemented a large number of laborers in the construction sector and improved the level of mechanization in the construction industry. A large number of prefabricated wall panels and components were used to speed up the progress of the project, and the organizational leadership of the building materials production sector was strengthened. Therefore, although the annual building materials production task was increased by 4.5% compared to the previous year, this department completed the annual production plan ahead of schedule on December 19.
    In the industrial field in 1959, the policy of industrial management reorganization was further implemented, and the implementation of new planning and financial systems brought positive results. For example, due to the widespread promotion of the new planning and financial systems, the annual plans of various factories were taken to the workers for discussion, which not only greatly improved the enthusiasm of the workers and made the plan itself a guarantee for the workers themselves, but also enriched and comprehensive the plan through discussion. Workers repeatedly increased the original plan during the discussion process, enabling production to advance at a faster rate.
    All the new measures of the state greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the working people. In 1959, the socialist labor competition appeared in an unprecedented magnificent situation. Many new forms of competition continued to emerge. The extensive development of "Socialist Labor Teams" throughout the country pushed the entire socialist competition to a higher level. At present, nearly 10,000 collectives across the country have participated in the competition for this glorious title, and more than 200 collectives have won the title of "Socialist Labor Team". Under the slogan of "Work, study, and live in a socialist way," the working people are marching forward with high morale. Not long ago, many collectives that won the title of "Socialist Labor Team" also put forward suggestions for learning from the example of Gaganova to help backward groups catch up with the advanced level, and some collectives are carrying out the "Everyone Becomes an Innovator" movement.
        Agriculture Rises Together
    In Czechoslovakia's national economy in 1959, it is particularly worth mentioning the new situation that has emerged in agriculture. Since the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, thoroughly reversing the situation in which agriculture lags behind industry in order to achieve a decisive turning point in agriculture has become the central task of the CPC, and it is a task for the whole people. At present, the agricultural front is really in good shape. The previously relatively silent rural areas are already striding forward to catch up with industry, and the rise of agriculture has created an indispensable prerequisite for the overall development of the national economy.
    In 1959, Czechoslovakia basically completed the task of agricultural collectivization in rural areas. The socialist component accounted for 84% of the country's farmland area. The rest is mainly small plots of land operated by workers' families and barren mountainous areas.
    With the basic completion of agricultural collectivization, increasing agricultural production has become the central issue in agriculture at present. In order to reverse the current situation in which crops cannot be self-sufficient and animal husbandry relies on imported feed, the CPC has decided to first increase the yield per unit area of ​​crops and the number of livestock products per hectare of land. In order to achieve this goal, the CPC has proposed to make full use of existing cultivated land, increase soil fertility, and adopt intensive farming methods. In 1959, the countryside invested more funds in land, initially changing the past situation of investing too much in building pigsties and cowsheds. The countryside implemented the Party's resolutions and adopted cultivation methods of selecting seeds, applying more fertilizer, weeding frequently, and deep plowing the land. Therefore, the grain harvest was good in 1959. The national grain output increased by 14.7% compared to the previous year, and the average national wheat yield increased by more than 400 kilograms per hectare. The unit area yield of crops in many agricultural cooperatives has more than doubled compared to the previous year.
    The water conservancy and soil improvement work widely carried out in 1959 is a new task in agriculture. This work is progressing smoothly. As of December 7, the country had completed soil improvement projects worth 70 million crowns. On 188,000 mu of land, through drainage and irrigation, low-lying and dry land were turned into fertile fields. More than 1,000 kilometers of canals were repaired, 300,000 cubic meters of pond mud were dug, and 1 million cubic meters of manure were accumulated. In addition to some large-scale projects being built by the state, many small and medium-sized water conservancy projects are built by the cooperatives themselves. These small-scale projects have played a significant role in flood control and drought resistance. In a mass movement to vigorously develop water conservancy that was launched in the winter of 1959, 300,000 people participated in voluntary labor. At present, many regions have completed the annual water conservancy construction plan and have entered the 1960 project ahead of schedule.
    The resale of machine tractor stations and agricultural machinery to agricultural cooperatives has created positive conditions for large-scale agricultural production and further mechanization. As of the end of November, 43% of tractors, 62% of threshers, and 57% of binding machines were owned by agricultural cooperatives. In the rural areas of the Czech region, 73% of the cooperatives have their own machines. With the resale of machines, tractor drivers have also been dispatched to the countryside, thus adding new factors to the production relations of the cooperatives. The influence of the working class in the countryside has become increasingly concrete and increased. The new system for the purchase of agricultural products passed in 1959 promoted the further growth of the collective economy of the cooperatives, especially making it possible for the originally relatively backward cooperatives to catch up with the level of advanced cooperatives more quickly.
    The development of agricultural production, the further improvement of the level of mechanization, and the development of the water conservancy movement have made it more necessary to carry out agricultural production in a large-scale production method. Farmers have also felt that the current form of cooperatives cannot fully adapt to the requirements of continued production growth. Therefore, the trend of merging some small cooperatives into large cooperatives has begun to emerge. According to this situation, President Novotny proposed that small cooperatives can be merged in places where conditions are mature, in accordance with the principle of voluntariness. At present, some places are conducting pilot projects for merging cooperatives, and some places are conducting discussions and preparations before merging cooperatives. From some areas where cooperatives have been merged, large cooperatives can better utilize large machines and achieve specialization, and labor can be allocated more rationally and fully, especially creating extremely favorable conditions for water conservancy construction. The work of merging cooperatives has only just begun. The CPC requires Party organizations at all levels to pay close attention to the growth of this new factor in the countryside, strictly implement the principle of voluntariness, and act according to local conditions.
    The strengthening of the CPC's leadership over agricultural production is the decisive factor for the prosperous scene in agriculture last year. Party committees at all levels of the CPC directly participated in the leadership of agricultural production, and rural Party organizations became the fighting headquarters for consolidating and developing socialist agriculture.
    Since the CPC Central Committee put forward the call to strive for a decisive turning point in agricultural production in March 1959, Party committees in various states and counties have successively held meetings specifically to study agricultural issues, greatly strengthening the leadership of agricultural production. Many responsible cadres went directly to the countryside, to the peasants, and many outstanding Party members and cadres were sent to the countryside to help cooperatives formulate production plans, improve management, and implement the Party's resolutions. In the Ostrava state alone, 400 Party cadres and workers are working in cooperatives. At present, Party committees and People's Committees at the county level are directly commanding production. In order to strengthen the Party's specific leadership over agriculture, the work of establishing Party branches directly in cooperatives (in the past, there were only Party organizations in villages) has also been strengthened over the past year, and more outstanding cooperative members have become the new blood of the Party in the countryside.
          Brighter Prospects
    1960 means an extremely extraordinary year for the people of Czechoslovakia. It is the last year of Czechoslovakia's Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, and also the prelude to the Third Five-Year Plan for completing socialist construction in Czechoslovakia. In this year, it will welcome the 15th anniversary of the birth of the socialist Czechoslovak Republic, realize the reorganization of the national administrative division, and conduct elections for the National Assembly and new People's Committees at all levels. With the gradual deepening of socialist construction in the economic, political, and ideological fields, many glorious and arduous tasks will also emerge in other aspects.
    Czechoslovakia's national economy will continue to advance in 1960. The total value of industrial output will increase by 10.2% compared to 1959, of which the production of means of production will grow faster than that of consumer goods. The rapid growth of industry has made Czechoslovakia today have the prerequisite for building the material and technical foundation for building socialism, and the acquisition of this achievement is inseparable from the rising political enthusiasm of the working people. One example is enough here. When preparing and discussing the 1960 plan, due to the fact that the working people put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals, the total value of industrial output stipulated in the annual plan was increased by about 10 billion crowns compared to what was stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan.
    Agriculture will be the primary focus of the CPC's work in 1960. In order to strive for agricultural production to reach a level commensurate with the existing industry and to eliminate the differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas as soon as possible, a series of new measures have been fully implemented from the beginning of the year, the most important of which are the new leadership and planning methods for agricultural production, the new system for the purchase of agricultural products, etc. The resale of agricultural machinery will be fully completed before harvest. Measures to improve soil and increase yield per unit area will also be further implemented. More cadres will be dispatched to cooperatives for long-term work and settlement, and the state will also increase loans for agricultural production and supply cooperatives with more agricultural machinery.
    Completing the socialist cultural revolution and realizing the socialist transformation in the ideological field remains one of the central tasks of Czechoslovakia's socialist construction. The socialist literary and art competition launched to welcome the 15th anniversary of Czechoslovakia's liberation will review the fruitful results of the past 15 years, especially since the 1959 Socialist Culture Congress, and further implement the congress's resolution on strengthening the cultural education of the working people and making culture closer to life and the people.
    The reorganization of the national administrative division, which is currently being planned and prepared, is one of the important measures for Czechoslovakia to complete socialist construction. The plan is to appropriately merge and re-divide the existing 19 states, 306 counties, and 14,800 townships according to their economic composition. This is based on the tremendous changes in current social relations and production relations, the further upsurge of the national economy, culture, and science, and the requirements for continuing to deepen socialist democracy. This reorganization will further expand the powers of People's Committees at all levels, bring into play the enthusiasm of the working people, and thus promote the leap forward development of socialist productive forces.
    Czechoslovakia's Third Five-Year Plan, starting in 1961, is a grand and historically significant program. During this period, the Czechoslovak working people will strive to complete the socialist construction of the motherland and begin preparing to transition to communist construction. The completion of the glorious 1960 national economic plan is the best preparation for the smooth realization of the Third Five-Year Plan.

    从胜利走向更大胜利
    本报记者　杨诩　林海
          风光无限好
    当捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民满怀信心地迎接新的一年时，他们的心头洋溢着浓厚的春意，因为在完成社会主义建设的大道上，他们在过去的一年中以自己的辛勤劳动为祖国创造了一片无限美好的风光。
    1959年是捷克斯洛伐克发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的第四年，又是捷共提出完成社会主义建设的战斗号召的第二年，如果说1958年是为这个战斗性的任务进行了一系列的准备的话，那么1959年就是向这一任务开始全面进军的一年，也是取得重大进展的一年。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民没有辜负党的期望和嘱托，1959年国民经济计划执行的情况是十分良好的。按照原订计划，捷克斯洛伐克工业生产在第二个五年计划的最后两年应增长16％，但实际上1959年一年就增长了11％。劳动生产率正在顺利地增长，每一工人的平均生产率比1958年提高了8％以上。生产成本也在按计划逐渐降低。1959年工业、建筑和交通运输计划都超额完成，一向落后于工业发展的农业也出现了一个崭新的局面。正如诺沃提尼总统所说的，这一切都为进一步提高捷克斯洛伐克1960年的国民经济计划创造了充分的可能。
        工业气象新
    捷克斯洛伐克是一个工业十分发达的国家，工业生产在工农业总产值中的比重达到85％。1959年捷克斯洛伐克工业不仅全面完成了国家计划，而且超过了原计划1．5％。作为国民经济基础的冶金和机械工业的生产比1958年增长了15％，它们的绝对增产数字几乎等于整个工业部门增长量的一半。过去一向不能满足国民经济需要的煤的生产在1959年不仅改变了以往落后的状况，而且跃居到工业生产的前列。这一年，燃料工业部门所属各厂矿在12月23日就发出了完成全年计划的捷报，共生产了八千一百万吨煤，在按人口平均计算方面，已是世界第一位。电力生产1959年也比前一年增长了11．9％，这不仅大大促进了工业生产的发展，而且为全国电气化提供了良好的物质条件。布拉格、比尔森和布德约维泽等一些州已比国家原订计划提前一年完成了全州电气化事业，在这些州的最偏僻的山村里也有了电灯等设备。
    捷克斯洛伐克在1959年工业生产上的良好成就，除了捷共大力加强对劳动人民的政治思想教育，因而广大工人阶级的生产积极性普遍高涨以外，同时也由于捷共中央和政府在工业生产中采取了一系列新的措施，使得工业战线上呈现了一片新的兴旺气象。
    1959年捷共在工业生产的领导中，强调了全面和重点相结合的方针，对工业生产中的一些薄弱环节和落后部门给予了特别的重视。比如煤的生产过去一直成为阻碍工业大踏步前进的因素，1959年捷共加强了对煤矿工业的领导，采取了一系列政治和技术的措施，如加强党在矿工中的宣传鼓动工作以及进一步实现采煤和运煤机械化等，因此彻底扭转了煤矿工业的落后状况。房屋建筑以往也长期不能完成国家计划，主要的原因是劳动力不足和原材料缺乏。1959年捷克斯洛伐克在建筑部门补充了大批劳动力，并且提高了建筑业的机械化水平，大量采用预制墙板和构件来加速工程进度，同时加强了建筑材料生产部门的组织领导工作，因此全年建筑材料的生产任务虽然比前一年提高了4．5％，但在12月19日这个部门就提前完成了全年的生产计划。
    在1959年的工业领域中，工业管理改组的方针得到了进一步的贯彻，新的计划和财务制度的付诸实行，都带来了积极的效果。例如，由于新的计划和财务制度的普遍推广，各个工厂的年度计划都采取了拿到工人中去讨论的办法，这样不仅大大提高了工人们的积极性，使计划本身变成了工人自己的保证，而且通过讨论使计划更充实、更全面，工人们在讨论的过程中还一再提高了原订计划，使生产能以更快的速度前进。
    国家的一切新措施都大大鼓舞了劳动人民的生产热情，1959年社会主义劳动竞赛出现了前所未有的波澜壮阔局面，许多新的竞赛形式不断涌现出来，“社会主义劳动队”在全国的广泛开展，把整个社会主义竞赛推向了一个更高的水平。目前全国已有近万个集体参加了争取这一光荣称号的竞赛，有二百多个集体获得了“社会主义劳动队”的称号。在“以社会主义方式工作、学习和生活”的口号下，劳动人民斗志昂扬地向前迈进。不久前，不少获得了“社会主义劳动队”称号的集体还提出了学习加干诺娃榜样的建议，要帮助落后的小组赶上先进的水平，还有一些集体正开展着“人人成为革新家”的运动。
        农业齐高涨
    在1959年捷克斯洛伐克国民经济中特别值得提起的是农业中出现的崭新局面。自从捷共第十一次代表大会以来，彻底扭转农业落后于工业的情况，以争取达到农业的决定性转折，已成为捷共的中心任务，而且是一项全民的任务。目前农业战线上真是一片好景，过去较沉寂的农村已经在昂首阔步地向着工业追赶，而农业的高涨又为国民经济的全面发展创造了不可缺少的前提。
    1959年捷克斯洛伐克农村中已经基本完成农业合作化的任务，社会主义成份所占土地已达全国农地面积的84％，剩下的主要是工人家属经营的小块土地和贫瘠的山区。
    随着农业合作化的基本完成，农业生产的提高就成为目前农业中的中心问题。为了扭转当前农作物还不能自给和畜牧业依靠输入饲料的情况，捷共决定首先提高农作物单位面积产量和每公顷土地上的畜产品数量。为了达到这一目的，捷共提出了充分利用现有耕地、提高土壤肥沃程度、采取精耕细作的田园化耕作方法。1959年农村中把更多的资金投向了土地，初步改变了过去把过多的投资放在兴建猪舍牛棚的情况。农村中贯彻了党的决议，采取了精选种、多施肥、勤锄草和深翻土地的耕作方法，因此1959年谷物收成良好。全国粮食产量比前一年增加14．7％，全国小麦平均每公顷增产四百多公斤，许多农业合作社的农作物单位面积产量比前一年提高一倍以上。
    1959年广泛展开的兴修水利改良土壤的工作，是农业中的一项新工作。这一工作进行得很顺利，到12月7日止，全国共完成了价值七千万克朗的土壤改良工程，在十八万八千亩土地上，通过排水灌溉，使洼地和旱地变成了良田，修整了一千多公里的渠道，挖了三十万立方米的塘泥，积肥一百万立方米。这些土壤改良的工程除了一些大的工程是由国家兴建外，许多中小型水利工程都是由合作社自己兴建的。这些小型工程在防涝抗旱中已发挥了不小作用。在1959年冬季掀起的一个大搞水利的群众性运动中，有三十万人参加了义务劳动，目前许多地区已完成了全年的水利兴修计划，提前进入了1960年的工程。
    机器拖拉机站农业机器的转售给农业合作社，对农业的大生产和进一步机械化创造了积极的条件。到11月底为止，已有43％的拖拉机、62％的打谷机和57％的捆谷机等为农业合作社所有。在捷克地区的农村中，已有73％的合作社有了自己的机器。随着机器的转售，拖拉机手也下放到农村，因而使合作社的生产关系增加了新的因素，工人阶级在农村的影响日益具体而且增加了。1959年通过的新的农产品收购制度，促进了合作社集体经济的进一步增长，特别是使原来较落后的社有可能更快赶上先进社的水平。
    农业生产的发展，机械化水平的进一步提高和兴修水利运动的开展，更加要求农业生产以大生产的方式进行。农民们也已经感到目前合作社的形式不能完全适应生产继续高涨的要求，因此开始出现了将一些小社并成大社的趋势。根据这一情况，诺沃提尼总统提出了按照自愿的原则在条件成熟的地方可以实行小社合并的建议。目前一些地方已在进行并社的试点工作，有些地方正在进行并社前的讨论和准备，从一些已经并社的地区来看，大的合作社能更好地利用大型机器和实现专业化，在劳动力的调配上也能做到更合理和更充分，特别是对兴修水利构成了极有利的条件。并社的工作目前还只是开始，捷共要求各级党组织密切注意农村中这一新的因素的成长，严格贯彻自愿的原则和根据当地的具体条件。
    捷共对农业生产领导的加强，是去年农业中一片欣欣向荣景象的决定性因素。捷共各级党委都直接参加了农业生产的领导，农村党组织成了巩固和发展社会主义农业的战斗司令部。
    自从1959年3月捷共中央提出争取农业生产达到决定性转折的号召后，各州、县党委都陆续召开了专门研究农业问题的会议，大大加强了对农业生产的领导。许多负责干部直接到农村中去，到农民中去，许多优秀的党员和干部被派到农村中帮助合作社制定生产计划，改善经营和贯彻党的决议。仅在俄斯特拉发州就有四百名党的干部和工人在合作社进行工作。目前，县一级的党委和人民委员会都做到了直接指挥生产。为了加强党对农业的具体领导，一年来还加强了直接在合作社建立党支部的工作（过去只是在村庄有党的组织），更多的优秀社员已成为党在农村的新血液。
          前景更光明
    1960年，对捷克斯洛伐克人民来说，意味着极其不平凡的一年。它是捷克斯洛伐克发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的最后一年，也是在捷克斯洛伐克完成社会主义建设的第三个五年计划的前奏。在这一年中，它将迎接社会主义的捷克斯洛伐克共和国诞生十五周年，实现全国行政区划的改组以及进行国民议会和新的各级人民委员会的选举。随着社会主义建设在经济、政治和思想领域的逐步深入，其他方面也都将出现不少光荣而艰巨的任务。
    捷克斯洛伐克国民经济在1960年中将继续迈进，工业总产值将比1959年增长10．2％，其中生产资料的生产将比消费资料增长更快。工业的飞速增长使得捷克斯洛伐克今天已经形成建成社会主义的物质技术基础的前提条件，而这一成就的获得又是同劳动人民的高涨政治热情分不开的。这里只举一个例子就够了，在准备和讨论1960年计划时，由于劳动人民提出了上万条合理化建议，因而年度计划所规定的工业总产值比第二个五年计划中所规定的提高了约一百亿克朗。
    农业将是1960年捷共工作的首要重点，为了争取农业生产达到与现有工业相适应的水平，尽快消除工农和城乡差别，从年初开始，一系列的新措施就全面付诸实行，其中最重要的有农业生产的新的领导和计划方法，新的农产品收购制度等。农业机器的转售工作在收获前将全部完成，改良土壤和提高单位面积产量的措施也将进一步贯彻。更多的干部将下放到合作社长期工作和落户，国家也将增加对农业生产的贷款和供应合作社更多的农业机器。
    完成社会主义文化革命、实现思想领域中的社会主义变革，仍然是捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设的中心任务之一。为迎接捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年而展开的社会主义文艺竞赛，将检阅十五年来特别是1959年社会主义文化代表大会以来的丰硕成果，并进一步实现大会有关加强劳动人民文化教育，以及使文化更接近生活和人民的决议。
    目前正在酝酿和准备的全国行政区划的改组，是捷克斯洛伐克完成社会主义建设的重要措施之一。计划将现有十九个州、三百零六个县和一万四千八百个乡，按照经济构成加以适当合并和重新划分，这是根据当前社会关系和生产关系的巨大变革、国民经济、文化和科学的进一步高涨以及继续加深社会主义民主的要求而提出的。这一改组将进一步扩大各级地方人民委员会的职权，发挥劳动人民的积极性，从而促进社会主义生产力的飞跃发展。
    从1961年开始的捷克斯洛伐克第三个五年计划是一个规模宏伟而又意义重大的历史性纲领。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民将在这一时期中争取完成祖国的社会主义建设，并着手准备向共产主义建设过渡。而光荣的1960年国民经济计划的完成，是顺利实现第三个五年计划的最好准备。
