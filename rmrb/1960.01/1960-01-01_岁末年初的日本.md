Official White Paper Admits People's Lives Continue to Worsen

    This Dispatch: Although the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government has touted Japan's post-war economic "prosperity," it has had to admit that the lives of the Japanese people have not improved. At the end of November 1959, the Economic Planning Agency of the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government issued a "White Paper on National Life," which talked a lot about the "major changes" in the structure of Japanese national life after the war, saying that the consumption of high-end consumer goods such as televisions, cameras, and electric washing machines increased year by year from 1957 to 1959.

    However, this white paper had to admit that the income of people who live on salary income is now less than two-thirds of what it was before the war; the average household asset is only about 80% of what it was before the war. The white paper attempts to cover up the reality of the difficult lives of the vast majority of Japanese people with such nonsense as national income tending to be "balanced."

    In an editorial commenting on the white paper, the "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out that the wages of university graduates with eight, ten, or fifteen years of service are nominally 175 to 180 times what they were before the war, but prices are 310 times what they were before the war. It can be seen that even the income of these senior intellectuals is far behind that of the pre-war period, let alone the lives of the vast number of workers and peasants.

Millions of Workers Fight for the Right to Live Launch Year-End Strikes

    This Dispatch: Millions of Japanese workers have launched vigorous struggles at the end of the year to defend their lives and workers' rights.

    Workers at thirteen major coal mining companies in Japan have launched strikes successively since the beginning of December to demand the payment of year-end allowances.

    Workers at the Furukawa Mining Company, who began an indefinite strike on December 4, achieved victory on December 21 when the company agreed to pay a year-end allowance of 19,000 yen. After fighting with the capitalists, the unions of other companies also forced the companies to accept the workers' demands. As of December 22, workers at eleven coal mining companies had achieved victory.

    Workers at the Meiji Mining Company and the Nittetsu Mining Company continued their struggle to demand the payment of year-end allowances, launching a refusal to work overtime on December 23, and holding a twenty-four-hour strike on the 24th.

    The Mitsui Miike Coal Mine Union in Omuta City, in its continuing struggle against staff reductions, began its twenty-second twenty-four-hour strike on December 25, with 12,000 union members participating.

    The All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, in order to demand higher wages, year-end allowances, and approval of International Labor Organization Convention No. 87 on freedom of association, organized 30% of postal workers to launch a leave-taking struggle from December 21, 1959. On the 23rd, the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union held collective bargaining with the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The agreement reached between the two sides stipulated an increase of 250 yen in wages, the payment of year-end allowances equivalent to 1.9 months' wages, and the payment of special allowances for increased efficiency. The struggle has come to a temporary end.

Nagoya City Disaster Victims Spending the New Year in Hunger and Cold

    This Dispatch: According to the Japanese "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper, the vast number of disaster victims in Nagoya, one of Japan's five largest cities, are suffering from hunger and cold at the end of the year.

    The bustling streets in the city center of Nagoya are filled with extravagance and revelry, but not far from the city center, in the large area that was recently hit by a typhoon, there is no trace of the New Year atmosphere, and everything is bleak.

    Workers' residential areas, which were submerged in water for more than twenty days, are still full of rubble and mud. People are only living in some temporary shelters, and about 7,000 households can only live in small shacks made of broken wood. The disaster victims also have problems with food and clothing, and many families are struggling to make ends meet.

    岁末年初的日本
    官方白皮书承认  人民生活继续恶化
    本报讯　尽管日本岸信介政府大肆吹嘘战后日本经济“繁荣”，但它不得不承认日本人民生活没有改善。1959年11月末，日本岸信介政府经济企划厅发表了一份“国民生活白皮书”，大谈战后日本国民生活构造的“重大变化”，说什么诸如电视机、照像机、电气洗衣机等高级消费品的消费量从1957年到1959年逐年增加。
    但是，这份白皮书不能不承认依靠工薪收入生活的人，现在的收入不及战前的三分之二；平均每户的资产额只及战前的80％左右。白皮书企图以国民收入趋于“平衡”等鬼话来掩盖日本广大人民生活困难的实情。
    日本“朝日新闻”在一篇评白皮书的社论中指出，大学毕业的职员工龄在八年、十年以上十五年以下的，他的工资按票面计算为战前的一百七十五倍和一百八十倍，但物价却为战前的三百一十倍。可见，连这些高级知识分子的收入都远远赶不上战前，那末广大工人和劳动农民的生活就更不用说了。
    千百万工人争取生活权利  岁末展开罢工斗争
    本报讯　日本千百万工人为了维护生活和工人权利，在岁末展开了强有力的斗争。
    在日本十三家大煤矿公司的工人为要求发给年终津贴，从12月初陆续开展罢工。
    12月4日开始进行无限期罢工的古河矿业公司的工人，于12月21日取得了胜利，公司方面同意发给年终津贴一万九千日元。其它公司的工会同资方进行斗争后，也迫使公司接受了工人的要求。到12月22日止，已有十一家煤矿公司的工人取得了胜利。
    明治矿业公司和日铁矿业公司工人在继续进行要求发给年终津贴的斗争中，于12月23日展开拒绝加班的斗争，于24日举行二十四小时罢工。
    大牟田市的三井三池煤矿工会，在为反对裁减人员而继续进行斗争中，于25日有一万二千名工会会员开始举行第二十二次二十四小时罢工。
    全递信从业员工会为了要求提高工资、发给年终津贴以及要求批准关于结社自由的国际劳工组织第八十七号公约，从1959年12月21日组织30％的邮政职工展开了请假斗争。23日全递信从业员工会同邮政省当局举行了集体谈判。在双方达成的协议中规定了提高二百五十日元工资、支付相当于一点九月份工资的年终津贴，以及支付提高效率的特别津贴等，斗争已暂告一段落。
    名古屋市灾民  饥寒交迫度新年
    本报讯　据日本“赤旗报”消息：岁末，日本五大城市之一的名古屋的广大灾民饥寒交迫。
    名古屋市的市中心一带繁华街道，金迷纸醉，甚是热闹，但离开市中心不远，那一大片不久前遭受台风侵袭的地区，丝毫嗅不到新年的气息，满目凄凉。
    浸在水中二十来天的工人住宅区，迄今到处是瓦砾和泥土，人们只是在一些临时搭起的住处栖身，大约有七千户的人家只能拾一些破烂木料搭个小窝棚住着。灾民的衣食也很成问题，许多人家勉强挣扎着糊口。
