New Look of North Korean Countryside

    To achieve agricultural mechanization in the next four to five years, the vast number of workers on the industrial front in North Korea are actively producing tractors and trucks to support agricultural production. The picture shows tractors and trucks arriving at the Sheshan Agricultural Cooperative in Sukchon County, South Pyongan Province, warmly welcomed by the cooperative members.

    The living standards of the North Korean people are constantly improving, and the need for meat is increasing. To supply more meat, North Korean agricultural cooperatives are vigorously developing pig farming. The picture shows the pig farm of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative.

    The face of the North Korean countryside is changing with each passing day. The picture shows the newly built rural houses in the Pungdok Plain, which include cultural centers where farmers can engage in various recreational activities after their hard work.
