Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 25th: Guizhou Province has made more outstanding progress in the field management of summer crops, including weeding, topdressing, and pest control, than in any previous year, through the comprehensive innovation of field management tools. Currently, rape and wheat throughout the province have been weeded and fertilized twice, with an average topdressing of over 3,000 jin per mu. Due to timely and meticulous management, seedlings are growing vigorously, with first-class seedlings accounting for more than 70% and third-class seedlings only about 8%. In Jianhe County, where the reform of field management tools is more advanced, wheat and rape have been weeded four times, with more than 20,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu, and third-class seedlings have been eliminated throughout the county.

In order to effectively manage wheat, rape, and miscellaneous grain crops and to fire the first shot for this year's agricultural harvest, people's communes throughout Guizhou Province launched a summer crop over-production contracting competition as early as the end of last year. In this campaign, in view of the large area of summer crops and the tight labor situation, various localities drew on the experience of tool reform in the current high-efficiency water conservancy movement and promptly organized blacksmiths, carpenters, and bamboo craftsmen to create or imitate a complete set of field management tools according to the needs of weeding, topdressing, and field transportation. More than 90,000 units (pieces) of fertilizer carts, wheat-weeding harrows, weeding hoes, and double-row fertilizer applicators and other tools have been reformed and promoted in Bijie Special District as early as a month ago. In early January, some communes in six counties of Anshun Special District also promoted more than 5,000 pieces of field management tools. Tongren Special District alone manufactured more than 70,000 pieces of indigenous agricultural implements. Many production teams in the county have basically realized the complete indigenous mechanization of field management work.

After the comprehensive reform of field management tools in various places, the efficiency of weeding, fertilizer transportation, topdressing, and other tasks has generally increased by one to a dozen times compared with the past. The fertilizer carts and automatic fertilizer applicators promoted in Anshun Special District are four to five times faster than manual operation; in Baling Management Area of Baling Commune in Xingren County, two 900-meter wooden rails were laid, and indigenous trains were used to transport fertilizer. One person can transport more than 6,000 jin per day, and the efficiency is eight times higher than carrying by shoulder pole. The area of summer crops in the province this year has doubled compared with last year, but the time to complete the second weeding task has been nearly two months earlier than last year, and half of the areas have begun the third weeding. Wangmo County completed the third weeding and topdressing task for the county's 180,000 mu of summer crops in early January, one month earlier than last year, and the labor used was only half of last year's. After vigorously carrying out the reform of field management tools in Malong Management Area of Fa'er Commune in Shuicheng County, the more than 4,000 mu of wheat, rape, and miscellaneous grains in the entire management area have been weeded four times and topdressed three times, achieving no weeds, no drought or flooding, no diseases or insect pests, and no missing seedlings or broken rows.

    革新锄草追肥除虫的全套农具
    贵州田间管理进度快质量高
    新华社贵阳25日电　贵州省通过全面革新田间管理工具，使夏收作物的中耕锄草、追肥防虫等工作做得比以往任何一年都出色。目前，全省的油菜、小麦已普遍薅淋两次，平均每亩追肥三千多斤。由于管理及时、细致，禾苗生长茁壮，一类苗占70％以上，三类苗只有8％左右。田间管理工具改革较为先进的剑河县，小麦、油菜已普遍薅完四次，每亩施追肥两万多斤，全县已经消灭了三类苗。
    为了切实管好小麦、油菜和杂粮作物，为今年农业丰收打响第一炮，贵州省各人民公社早在去年年底就开展了夏收作物超包产竞赛运动。在这一运动中，各地针对夏收作物面积大、劳力紧的实际情况，吸取了当前水利高工效运动中改革工具的经验，及时组织铁匠、木匠、竹匠，根据锄草、追肥、田间运输等工作的需要，大量创制或仿造整套田间管理的工具。毕节专区早在一个月以前就改革推广了九万多部（件）追肥车、薅麦耙、除草镐以及双行追肥器等工具。安顺专区六个县的部分公社1月上旬也推广了五千多件田间管理工具。铜仁专区仅土药械就制造了七万多件。全县有不少生产队已经基本上实现了田间管理工作全部土机械化。
    各地在全面改革田间管理的工具以后，锄草、运肥、追肥等工效，都普遍比过去提高了一倍到十几倍。安顺专区推广的追肥车和自动追肥器，比手工操作快四、五倍；兴仁县巴铃公社巴铃管理区，铺设了两条九百米的木轨，用土火车运肥，一人一天能运六千多斤，工效比肩挑提高了八倍。全省今年夏收作物面积比去年扩大了一倍，但完成第二遍薅淋任务的时间却比去年提前了近两个月，并有半数地区开始了第三遍薅淋工作。望谟县在1月上旬就结束了全县十八万亩夏收作物的第三次除草、追肥任务，时间比去年提前一个月，所用劳力只相当去年一半。水城县法耳公社马龙管理区大搞田间管理工具改革后，全管理区的四千多亩小麦、油菜和杂粮，已薅草四次，追肥三次，实现了无杂草、无旱涝、无病虫害、无缺苗断行。
