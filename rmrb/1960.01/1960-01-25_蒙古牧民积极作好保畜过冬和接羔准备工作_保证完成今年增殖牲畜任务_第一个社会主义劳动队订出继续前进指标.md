Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar Dispatch: Mongolian laboring herdsmen are actively preparing for livestock protection over the winter and lambing, creating favorable conditions for completing the 1960 livestock increase task.

The representatives who participated in the recent Fourth Plenary Session of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Agricultural and Pastoral Cooperatives Representatives' Congress, after returning to their respective regions at the end of last December, met with laboring herdsmen to convey the spirit of the meeting's resolutions. Party and government organs at all levels simultaneously launched activities to publicize and study the documents of the Party Central Committee's plenary session, which greatly encouraged the broad masses of herdsmen.

Hovkhangai Province and Bayankhongor Province both held mass rallies. The responsible persons of the provincial party committees made reports at the meetings. East Gobi Province also decided to go deep into the production teams of the cooperatives to report the content of the resolutions and the tasks for developing agricultural and pastoral production this year to the members.

After listening to the reports and studying the documents, the herdsmen in various regions expressed their warm support for the measures taken by the Party Central Committee to consolidate the cooperatives economically and organizationally, and stated that they would do a good job in protecting livestock and preparing for lambing at present, ensure the completion of the task of increasing livestock in 1960, and implement the resolutions of the Central Committee's plenary session. Members of the "Choibalsan" cooperative in Bulgan Province decided to actively carry out socialist labor competitions this year to ensure an 80% increase in livestock compared to last year, and achieve 110% of the three-year plan's livestock increase task. A milkmaid from the "Prosperity Cooperative" in Hovkhangai Province is determined to be responsible for raising fifteen dairy cows, averaging 700 liters of milk per cow.

While accepting new tasks, members of many cooperatives immediately launched work on livestock protection over the winter and preparation for lambing on the frigid grasslands. Some cooperatives that have begun lambing have achieved a high survival rate of young lambs due to the active responsibility of the members. More than 2,100 lambs and kids of the "Truth" cooperative in Govi-Altai Province have survived completely.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar Dispatch: Mongolia's first "Socialist Labor Team" - the Ulaanbaatar Railway Locomotive Repair Factory Labor Team - recently repaired a locomotive in ten days, shortening the repair time by two days compared to the past.

All members of this labor team "worked, studied, and lived in a socialist manner" last year, achieving good results. In terms of work, last year this team improved labor efficiency, shortened the locomotive repair time, and saved a total of 175 workdays. This year, the team members expressed their intention to continue to improve work efficiency on this basis and catch up with the standard of Soviet workers repairing a locomotive in eight days within two to three years. The team also proposed a guarantee to save the state 170,000 Tugriks (Mongolian currency) within one year.

Last year, all twelve members of the labor team were promoted in cultural studies. The five members with low cultural levels originally made rapid progress with the help of other members. Now, the average cultural level of all team members has reached the fourth grade level. In addition to cultural learning this year, political theory and technical learning will be strengthened, and the members have all made study plans.

In terms of life, the team members carried out amateur sports activities and paid attention to cleanliness and hygiene. The team members also helped each other and arranged their lives, making life enjoyable.

The team members used the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to criticize each other, overcome shortcomings, and constantly maintain full political and labor enthusiasm. All team members received a total of seventy-nine awards last year.

This year, inspired by the slogan "Better Today Than Yesterday," the team members will strive to achieve greater achievements in work, study, and life than last year. (Attached picture)

    第一个社会主义劳动队订出继续前进指标
    新华社乌兰巴托电　蒙古广大劳动牧民正在积极作好保畜过冬和接羔保羔的准备工作，为完成1960年的增殖牲畜任务创造良好条件。
    参加不久前召开的蒙古人民革命党四中全会和农牧业合作社代表大会的代表们，在去年12月底返回各地后，分别和劳动牧民们会见，传达会议决议精神，各地党政机关同时开展了宣传和学习党中央全会文件的活动，这使广大牧民受到了巨大的鼓舞。
    后杭爱省、巴彦洪果尔省，都举行了群众集会。省党委会的负责人在会上作了传达报告。东戈壁省还决定深入合作社生产队，向社员们报告决议的内容和今年发展农牧业生产的任务。
    各地牧民在听了传达报告和学习文件后，都表示热烈拥护党中央关于从经济上和组织上巩固合作社采取的措施，并且表示要在目前作好保畜接羔工作，保证完成1960年增殖牲畜的任务，贯彻执行中央全会的决议。布尔干省“乔巴山”合作社社员决定今年要积极开展社会主义劳动竞赛，保证比去年增殖牲畜80％，以110％实现三年计划的增殖牲畜的任务。后杭爱省“繁荣合作社”的一个挤奶员决心负责饲养十五头奶牛，平均每头挤奶七百公升。
    许多合作社的社员们在接受新任务的同时，立即在严寒的草原上开展保畜过冬、准备接羔的工作。有些开始接羔的合作社由于社员们积极负责，幼羔成活率很高。戈壁阿尔泰省“真理”合作社有两千一百多头绵、山羊的幼羔完全成活。
    新华社乌兰巴托电　蒙古第一个“社会主义劳动队”——乌兰巴托铁路机车修理厂劳动队，最近以十天的时间检修好了一台机车，比过去检修时间缩短了两天。
    这个劳动队的全体队员在去年“以社会主义的方式工作、学习和生活”，取得了良好的成绩，在工作方面，去年这个队提高了劳动效率，缩短了机车修理时间，共节约一百七十五个劳动日。今年队员们表示要在这个基础上继续提高工作效率，在两三年内赶上苏联工人在八天内检修好一台机车的标准。全队还提出了要在一年内为国家节约十七万图格里克（蒙币名）的保证。
    劳动队的十二名队员去年在文化学习中都升了级，原来文化低的五个队员在其他队员的帮助下进步很快，现在全队队员的文化程度平均达到了四年级的水平。今年除文化学习外，还要加强政治理论和技术学习，队员们都已订出了学习计划。
    在生活方面，队员们开展业余体育活动，讲究清洁卫生。队员们还相互帮助，安排生活，使生活过得愉快。
    队员们利用批评和自我批评的武器相互开展批评，克服缺点，经常保持着饱满的政治和劳动热情。全队队员在去年共得过七十九次奖励。
    今年队员们在“今天比昨天好”的口号的鼓舞下，将争取在工作、学习和生活方面比去年取得更大的成就。（附图片）
