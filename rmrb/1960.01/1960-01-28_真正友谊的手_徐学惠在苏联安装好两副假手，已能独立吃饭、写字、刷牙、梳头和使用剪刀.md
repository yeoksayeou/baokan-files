    The Hand of True Friendship
    Xu Xuehui Fitted with Two Prosthetic Hands in the Soviet Union, Now Able to Eat, Write, Brush Teeth, Comb Hair, and Use Scissors Independently
    Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: According to a report from Manzhouli by a "Workers' Daily" reporter, female hero Xu Xuehui, who sacrificed her hands to protect national property, has been fitted with two new hands in Chita. As of the morning of January 26th, she has been able to independently eat, write, brush her teeth, comb her hair, and use scissors. The Chita Orthopedic Appliance Factory is currently rushing to produce a more dexterous third prosthetic hand for Xu Xuehui. Once this prosthetic hand is completed, Xu Xuehui will be able to engage in complex labor.
    The sincere and selfless help and boundless care of the Soviet people have deeply moved Xu Xuehui. She said: I don't know how to thank the Soviet comrades enough. I can only work harder and serve the people better to repay the care of the Soviet people.
    Xu Xuehui arrived in Chita on the evening of January 15th at the invitation of the director of the Chita Orthopedic Appliance Factory.
    On the 18th, the staff of the Chita Orthopedic Appliance Factory enthusiastically examined Xu Xuehui's wounds, took measurements and photographs, and made a plaster model of the entire upper limb. They immediately began rushing to make particularly dexterous prosthetic hands and also fitted Xu Xuehui with the first prosthetic hand for general labor. On the same day, Xu Xuehui was able to use the prosthetic hand to eat, write, and draw. Later, Lomanov specially took a pair of scissors for Xu Xuehui to further practice cutting things. On the 21st, Director Lomanov had Xu Xuehui try on the second prosthetic hand, which looks the same as a real hand and is specially designed for social occasions, making it easy to shake hands with people.
    On the 17th, Lomanov hosted an informal banquet at his home to entertain Xu Xuehui. The factory director, who overcame misfortune and regained his ability to work, specially demonstrated to Xu Xuehui how he used his prosthetic hand to use a hammer, axe, saw, and make woodcuts. With a heart full of gratitude, Xu Xuehui gave the notebook and fountain pen presented to her by the National Hero Congress to Director Lomanov. This moved the gray-haired factory director, who couldn't help but say to Xu Xuehui: In order for you to regain your ability to work and continue to work for your country, I will do everything in my power to help you, just like a father to his beloved daughter. Not only will I personally do everything in my power to help you, but all the Soviet people in our factory will do so.
    Entrusted by Cao Juru, President of the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, Xu Xuehui also presented gifts and a letter of thanks to Director Lomanov. In his letter to Lomanov, Cao Juru said: We will never forget your deep concern. This concern makes us infinitely admire you, admire your great proletarian internationalist spirit. Xu Xuehui's new hands will be the hands of true Sino-Soviet friendship.
    During these days, Xu Xuehui was also invited to visit and tour some factories and schools in Chita and introduced the achievements made by Chinese young workers and staff in the cause of socialist construction.
    On the 23rd, Kozlov, Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the CPSU and First Secretary of the Chita Oblast Party Committee, and Smirnov, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Chita Oblast Soviet of Working People's Deputies, met with Xu Xuehui, expressed their warm greetings, and presented her with a gold watch engraved with the words "Presented to Xu Xuehui."

    真正友谊的手
    徐学惠在苏联安装好两副假手，已能独立吃饭、写字、刷牙、梳头和使用剪刀
    新华社27日讯　据“工人日报”记者从满洲里报道，为保卫祖国财产献出双手的女英雄徐学惠，已经在赤塔安好两副新手。到26日上午为止，她已能独立地吃饭、写字、刷牙、梳头和使用剪刀。赤塔整形器材厂目前还正在为徐学惠赶制更为灵巧的第三副假手。这副假手制成功后，徐学惠将能从事复杂的劳动。
    苏联人民真诚无私的帮助和无限关怀使徐学惠深深受到感动，她说：我不知道应怎样感谢苏联同志才好，我只有更好地工作、更好地为人民服务，来报答苏联人民的关怀。
    徐学惠是应苏联赤塔整形器材厂厂长的邀请，于15日晚到达赤塔的。
    18日，赤塔整形器材厂的职工，热情地检查了徐学惠的伤口，量尺寸照相，制作了整个上肢的石膏模型，立即动手赶制特别灵巧的假手，同时给徐学惠安上了一般劳动用的第一副假手。当天，徐学惠就开始能用假手吃饭、写字、画画。以后，洛玛诺夫又特别拿了一把剪刀让徐学惠进一步练习剪东西。21日，洛玛诺夫厂长又给徐学惠试戴了第二副假手，外形和真手一样，专供交际时使用，可以方便地同人握手。
    17日，洛玛诺夫在自己家里设便宴招待徐学惠。这位战胜了不幸重新获得劳动能力的厂长，特别为徐学惠表演了自己怎样借助于假手，使用锤子、斧头、锯子和烙制版画。徐学惠怀着无限感激的心情将全国群英大会赠给自己的笔记本、自来水笔转送给洛玛诺夫厂长。这使得头发花白的厂长也激动起来，情不自禁地对徐学惠说：为了使你能恢复劳动能力，能继续为祖国工作，我将尽一切力量帮助你，就像父亲对自己心爱的女儿那样。不仅是我个人将尽一切力量帮助你，我们工厂所有苏联人都会这样。
    徐学惠还受中国人民银行总行行长曹菊如的委托，向洛玛诺夫厂长赠送了礼物，递交了感谢信。曹菊如在给洛玛诺夫的信中说：你的深切关怀，我们永远不会忘记。这种关怀，使我们对你无限敬佩，敬佩你这种伟大的无产阶级国际主义精神。徐学惠的新的双手，将是真正的中苏友谊手。
    在这些日子里，徐学惠还应邀访问、参观了赤塔的一些工厂、学校，并且介绍了中国青年职工在社会主义建设事业中所取得的成就。
    23日，苏共中央候补委员、赤塔州党委第一书记科兹洛夫、赤塔州劳动人民苏维埃执行委员会主席斯米尔诺夫，接见了徐学惠，表示亲切的慰问，并且赠送给她一块上面刻着“赠给徐学惠”字样的金手表。
