Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 2nd. The tens of thousands of iron and steel warriors of Anshan Iron and Steel achieved a flying start in seizing the red flag of the 1960 production kickoff. On January 1st, all major products of the company, including steel, iron, steel products, concentrate, and coke, comprehensively overfulfilled the daily plan. Among them, steel overproduced by 4,260 tons compared to the state plan, iron overproduced by 462 tons compared to the plan, and steel products overproduced by 767 tons compared to the plan.

At zero hour on the 1st, as soon as the New Year's bell rang, the employees of more than 40 plants and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel, who had started work early, immediately plunged into the joint technical performance competition for the first week of 1960. On this day, the plants and mines created more than 1,400 new records and implemented more than 500 technical innovations.

In the battle to seize the opening red, the workers of the plants and mines highly promoted the spirit of communist collaboration, actively cooperated with each other, and created favorable conditions for each other. In the steelmaking plants, when a furnace needed patching, workers from nearby open-hearth furnaces would run over to help. Workers in raw materials, transportation, and ingot casting actively created conditions for the open-hearth furnace workers to achieve rapid steelmaking; workers in mines, sintering, and transportation plants also actively cooperated with steelmaking, ironmaking, and steel rolling plants to improve production.

Many leading cadres of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Anshan Iron and Steel spent New Year's Day with the workers at the production site. They participated in production and led production, which greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 1st. Employees of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company achieved a "good start" in production at the beginning of the year. In the first two shifts of New Year's Day, the company's steel, iron, and steel products comprehensively overfulfilled the plan. The shift output of steel exceeded 13%, pig iron exceeded 9%, and steel products completed the shift plan. Compared with the average shift output in December, the average shift output of steel in the first two shifts today increased by 64%, and steel products increased by 46.8%. Product quality has also improved significantly, with the qualified rate of open-hearth steel reaching 100%. In the sixteen hours of the first two shifts on New Year's Day, the company also created more than 700 new production records.

In Chongqing Iron and Steel, everyone hoped to offer a generous gift for the New Year. Last night, the first shift of employees to welcome the New Year started work early, and held a swearing-in and martial arts competition next to the steelmaking furnace, rolling mill, and ironmaking furnace. One hour before the arrival of 1960, they were fully prepared to join the battle.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 2nd. On the first day of 1960, Wuhan Iron and Steel employees won a bumper harvest in steel and coke production. On this day, steel production exceeded the average daily output in late December by more than double, setting a record high since production began.

Wuhan Iron and Steel made full preparations to achieve a good start. The ironmaking plant increased the storage of sintered ore. No. 2 blast furnace was comprehensively inspected in advance, and production quickly entered a normal state. An iron mixing furnace in the steelmaking plant was put into production on December 30th in advance, ensuring the supply of molten iron for the three open-hearth furnaces, creating favorable conditions for high-quality and high-yield steelmaking.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 1st. Employees of the First Steelmaking Plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company won the "good start" of 1960 with new soaring enthusiasm. The first shift of workers who started smelting the first furnace of steel in 1960 amid the sound of firecrackers smelted a total of three furnaces of steel from zero to eight o'clock, which was half a furnace of steel more than in December last year, completing 38.8% of the daily plan. The quality of the steel reached 100%.

As soon as the first shift workers started work, they launched a head-to-head performance competition for rapid steelmaking. In the performance competition, they promoted five advanced experiences famous throughout the country, achieving good results. Today, Wang Linshan, Secretary of the Factory Party Committee, Shen Guowei, Director of the Factory, and Han Jun, Chairman of the Labor Union, all worked and performed with the workers to welcome the New Year's "good start."

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 1st. Employees of Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant fired the first shot of the New Year with excellent results: steel production exceeded the plan by 7.2%, all of which was first-class quality, steel billet production exceeded 10.1%, and steel products exceeded 6.17%.

After smelting the last furnace of steel in 1959, the steelmaking workers of the steelmaking department took advantage of the victory to advance and started the competition for the first high-yield week of 1960. Leading cadres such as the secretary of the factory party committee and the director of the factory went to the front line to participate in production, which further encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for labor. The workers who took over the second furnace arrived at the factory more than two hours early, held a pre-shift meeting, studied measures to shorten smelting time and produce good steel, and achieved a good start and continuous progress.

Good news of a good start also came continuously from the rolling mills.

The workers of Group B of the Second Small Rolling Section of the First Branch launched a technical performance competition from the start of the shift, creating a new record of more than 14 tons of steel production per machine hour, which was more than three tons higher than the highest machine hour output in December last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 2nd. Dalian Steel Plant had a happy start this year. On New Year's Day, steel production exceeded the daily plan by 7.1%, an increase of 10.9% over the average daily output in the fourth quarter of last year.

As soon as the first shift workers took over, new production records continued to emerge. The workers in the First Steelmaking Workshop were full of energy, strictly controlled the chemical composition and increased the temperature of the molten steel, accelerated the change of steel slag, so that the steelmaking time per furnace was shortened a lot compared to the plan, not only smelting three furnaces of steel in a row, but also creating conditions for the next shift. New records in converter steelmaking also emerged in large numbers in the Second Steelmaking Workshop.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 1st. Daye Steel Plant achieved its first victory in production at the beginning of the year. On New Year's Day, all shifts in the plant completed their plans. The first shift of the whole plant comprehensively overfulfilled the plan for steel, steel products, and pig iron, achieving an all-around success.

Today, the First Steelmaking Department focused on the main key to smelting high-quality steel, and adopted the technical measures of mixing open-hearth steel and electric furnace slag in the first shift to achieve high-quality and high-yield. Employees of the converter workshop in the Second Steelmaking Department broke the convention that the first three furnaces of a new furnace could not smelt rimmed steel, and all furnaces smelted rimmed steel, achieving a comprehensive victory of high yield, high quality, and multiple varieties.
