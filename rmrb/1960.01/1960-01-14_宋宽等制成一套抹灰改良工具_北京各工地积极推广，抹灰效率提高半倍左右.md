This newspaper reports: Song Kuan, a plastering foreman at the Beijing Teaching Instrument Factory construction site, and the workers have jointly developed a complete set of plastering tools, which greatly improves plastering efficiency. According to statistics from seven plastering teams at this construction site, the plastering efficiency has increased by 50% to 120% after using this set of tools, and the quality is good.

This set of plastering tools has ten types, of which two (corner trowels for internal and external corners, and a notched screed for leveling the sand base coat) were learned by Song Kuan at the National "Heroes' Conference." The characteristics of these tools are: simple to make, inexpensive, easy to use, and effective. Most of the materials for manufacturing these plastering tools are scrap wood and old sheet metal; three people can make a set in one day.

In the past, when plastering workers plastered, they always held a mortarboard in their left hand and a small trowel in their right hand, plastering the wall bit by bit, taking six scoops of mortar to finish. Now, they use a large flat trowel made of thin sheet metal. This tool is 40 cm long and 30 cm wide, ten times larger than a small trowel. When plastering workers use it, they can directly put three scoops of mortar on the board, hold the double handles behind the board with both hands, and move the lower end of the large flat trowel close to the wall from bottom to top. In one move they can finish all three scoops of mortar. The efficiency is one and a half times higher than in the past, and the plastered surface is smoother than that made with a small trowel.

When plastering corners, workers use a plastering tool that can be folded inwards and outwards to form a 90-degree right angle - a corner trowel. It is made of two pieces of 37 cm long galvanized iron sheets, shaped like hinges. Each iron sheet has a wooden handle on top. Plastering workers hold these two handles with both hands to plaster; after plastering, they use a wooden inside corner tool to plaster the corners a few times to smooth the uneven gray surface. In the past, plastering inside and outside corners required small trowels, and only plastering workers with high technical skills could guarantee the quality of the gray surface. Now, with the corner trowels and wooden inside corner tools, general plastering workers can also plaster corners, and the efficiency can be increased by more than one time.

Plastering ceilings is the most tiring process. In the past, plastering workers looked up, holding a mortarboard in one hand and a small trowel in the other, plastering bit by bit, and could only plaster 30 square meters a day. Now, using a hinged ceiling plastering tool, workers can operate with both hands at the same time, and the efficiency is one time higher than in the past. This tool can not only plaster flat ceilings, but also plaster the edges of the ceiling and the junction of the ceiling and walls.

This set of tools also includes a screed for determining the thickness of the base coat on the wall, a corner trowel for plastering outside corners, a concave rendering float for plastering white ash, a textured roller for making the wall surface rough in theater construction, and a wooden trowel for smoothing small areas of uneven walls. They all improve work efficiency.

Song Kuan is a Communist Party member who has been a plastering worker for 21 years. He has successively won the honorary titles of Beijing Model Worker and National Advanced Producer. When he saw that other types of work were constantly breaking quotas, while plastering was often unable to reach quotas due to reliance on tedious manual operations, he wanted to quickly improve the tools. After participating in the National "Heroes' Conference," this idea became even stronger. After work, he went home and drew various plastering tool designs on paper. Once a design was completed, he would find workers to study and improve it together. The party branch of the construction site gave enthusiastic support. As a result, they made a complete set of plastering tools in just half a month.

The Beijing Basic Construction leadership attaches great importance to this set of plastering tools. In the past half a month or so, it has successively organized plastering workers from various construction sites to visit and learn. At present, this set of plastering tools is being promoted among plastering workers in the city, and the efficiency is generally increased by about 50%. (Attached images)

### 宋宽等制成一套抹灰改良工具  北京各工地积极推广，抹灰效率提高半倍左右

    宋宽等制成一套抹灰改良工具
    北京各工地积极推广，抹灰效率提高半倍左右
    本报讯　北京教学仪器厂工地抹灰工长宋宽，和工人们共同研究制成了一整套抹灰工具，大大提高了抹灰效率。据这个工地七个抹灰小组的统计，使用这套工具以后，抹灰效率提高50％到120％，而且质量良好。
    这套抹灰工具共有十种，有两种（抹墙角的阴阳角器，平整砂子底灰的断筋大杠）是宋宽在全国“群英会”上学习来的。这些工具的特点是：制作简单，花钱很少，使用方便，效果显著。制造这些抹灰工具的大部分材料是碎木料和旧铁皮，三个人一天就能做出一套。
    以前抹灰工人抹灰，总是左手拿盛灰板，右手拿一把小抹子，在墙上一下一下地抹，一勺灰要抹六次才能抹完。现在，他们用一块薄铁皮做成的大平板抹灰器抹灰。这种工具长四十公分，宽三十公分，比小抹子大十倍。抹灰工人用它抹灰，可以直接把三勺灰浆盛放在板上，双手握着板后的双柄，把大平板下端紧贴在墙上，自下而上地移动，一下子就能把三勺灰浆都抹完，效率比过去提高一倍半，灰面比小抹刀抹出来的还平整。
    抹墙角时，工人用的是一种往里往外都能折成九十度直角的抹灰器——阴阳角器。它是用两块三十七公分长的白铁皮做的，形状是合页式的。每块铁皮上面有一个木制把手。抹灰工双手握着这两个把手抹灰；抹完之后，再用一种木制的阴角器在墙角上抹几下，把高低不平的灰面抹得平平整整。过去，抹阴、阳角（即内、外墙角）都是用小抹子，需要技术水平较高的抹灰工，才能保证灰面质量。现在，有了阴阳角器和木阴角器，一般抹灰工也能抹墙角了，效率能提高一倍以上。
    顶篷抹灰是最累的一道工序。从前，抹灰工人仰着头，一手拿盛灰板，一手拿小抹子一下一下往上抹，一天只能抹三十平方米。现在，使用一种合页式的顶篷抹灰器，工人们双手同时操作，效率比过去提高一倍。这种工具不仅能抹平整的顶篷，还可以抹平顶边沿和顶篷同墙面交接的地方。
    这套工具，另外还有确定墙面底灰厚度用的冲筋器，抹阳角（外角）的阳角器，抹白灰用的凹形罩面抹灰器，影剧院建设中把墙面作成毛面状的拉毛滚子，以及平整小部分凹凸平墙面的木制抹子。它们都提高了工作效率。
    宋宽是共产党员，做了二十一年的抹灰工人，曾经连续获得北京市劳动模范、全国先进生产者的光荣称号。当他看到其他工种都在不断突破定额，而抹灰工种因为依靠繁琐的手工操作经常达不到定额时，他便想迅速改进工具。参加全国“群英会”以后，他这种念头更加强烈。下工以后回到家里，他就在纸上画各种抹灰工具的图样。画成一个图样，就找工人们一起研究改进。工地的党支部给予了热情的支持。结果，他们只用短短半个月的时间，就制成了整套的抹灰工具。
    北京基本建设领导部门十分重视这套抹灰工具，最近半个多月来，已经陆续组织了各个工地的抹灰工人去参观学习。目前，这套抹灰工具正在全市抹灰工人中推广，效率一般提高50％左右。（附图片）
