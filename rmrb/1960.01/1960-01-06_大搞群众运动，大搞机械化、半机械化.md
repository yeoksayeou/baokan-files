Vigorously Launch Mass Movements, Vigorously Implement Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization
Cui Ronghan, Director of the Industry Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

Currently, a technological innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization is unfolding extensively in factories and enterprises throughout Tianjin. This large-scale mass movement has propelled Tianjin's campaign to increase production and practice economy to a new stage, significantly increasing industrial labor productivity.

The mechanization and semi-mechanization movement in Tianjin has progressed rapidly. In just over a month, according to statistics from eight districts in the city, nearly 900,000 technical innovation proposals were put forward, and 450,000 of them were quickly implemented. Among these, there were more than 5,000 significant mechanization and semi-mechanization projects. The development of the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement has played a significant role in promoting production and the technical transformation of industry. The degree of mechanization in many factories and enterprises has been further improved. According to statistics from the city's urban industrial areas, the percentage of production workers engaged in mechanized operations increased from 25% at the beginning of the year to 28%; semi-mechanized operations increased from 18% to 24%; and manual operations decreased from 57% to 48%. Many job types and procedures have increased production capacity by multiples or even tenfold, greatly improving labor productivity. The working conditions of workers have also been further improved, reducing labor intensity. The workers' enthusiasm for labor has been further directed towards combining hard work with skillful work. Many workers are using their spare time to study technology and learn politics and culture. Many factories have not only solved the problem of labor shortages but have also begun to save labor. The plans formulated by Tianjin Municipality and various industrial bureaus, after being fully implemented in the spring of 1960, will increase the city's mechanized and semi-mechanized production operations from 52% to 65%, and manual operations will decrease from 48% to 35%. It is estimated that nearly 50,000 workers can be saved in 1960.

The reason why Tianjin's mechanization and semi-mechanization movement has gained such rapid momentum and achieved such significant results is not accidental. This is not only because vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization reflects the ardent aspirations of the broad masses of workers, but also because it is an objective requirement for the continued leap forward in production. Although Tianjin's industrial technology level has greatly improved in recent years, its industrial technical equipment is still relatively backward, and most factories are still "old soldiers with old guns." Manual labor still accounts for a large proportion of the city's production, and heavy operations still exist in manual labor. With the development of the technological innovation and technical revolution movement, this situation is increasingly unable to meet the requirements of high-speed production development.

How to start the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement? Should it be fully launched all at once, or should it be carried out with emphasis? Tianjin has adopted the method of grasping key points to drive the overall situation, first focusing on the six job types with a large proportion of manual and heavy labor, such as crane operators, crushers, foundry workers, forging workers, fitters, and packaging workers, and industries such as shoemaking, sock weaving, glass products, rubber products, paper products, and single-machine weaving. Leading cadres concentrated their efforts, formulated plans, and took measures to achieve key breakthroughs in these job types and industries. In just over a month, rapid progress was made, especially in the mechanization of lifting and transportation, which was a weak link. Back carrying, lifting, carrying, and pulling were quickly replaced by carts, light rails, solid material conveyor belts, and liquid material pipelines in many factories. After the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant adopted the advanced experience of three-slot steel tapping, its output increased sharply, but because most of the handling and lifting workers were engaged in manual operations, the steel ingots could not be transported out, resulting in a large backlog. The workers spent four days making a gantry crane, which doubled transportation efficiency and broke through the weak link in high-speed production development. The sock weaving company converted 462 hand-operated sock knitting machines into electric sock knitting machines and 230 hand-operated sock weaving machines into electric looms. The company's manual operations decreased from 90% to 40%. In 1960, not only was it unnecessary to increase staff, but more than 300 workers have already been transferred to support new factories.

After breakthroughs were made in key job types and key industries, the effectiveness and experience of vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization were quickly disseminated throughout the city. As a result, the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement quickly blossomed in all directions, from the metallurgical industry and the electromechanical industry to the chemical industry, the textile industry, and light industry. Those with a higher degree of mechanization went to the next level, achieving high-speed, continuous, and combined mechanization, and striving to develop towards automation and semi-automation.

In vigorously promoting the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement, it is also necessary to implement the principle of "walking on two legs." This means combining foreign methods with local methods, combining large-scale with medium-sized and small-scale, combining state investment with mobilizing the masses to tap the potential of enterprises, combining the manufacture of new equipment with the transformation of old equipment, and combining the continuous adoption of new technologies with improving the workers' operating skills. According to this principle, various industrial bureaus, industrial companies, and factories and enterprises have formulated plans for vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization. The municipal and district industrial bureaus have planned more than 1,900 projects, which will be implemented in batches from the winter of 1959 to the spring of 1960. In implementing these projects, we particularly emphasize "combining foreign and local methods, using foreign methods when possible, using local methods when foreign methods are not possible, using local methods first and then foreign methods, and gradually improving." We concentrate our efforts on first implementing key projects that are easy to do, cost little, produce quick results, and urgently need to be resolved in production. The paper products factory could not meet the need for making cement bags. The factory originally planned to spend 350,000 yuan to buy an automatic bag-tying machine. After the workers learned about it, they only spent 9,000 yuan to make a machine out of wood, and the effect was very good. By making three more, the current 61 people operating it could be reduced to 5 people. Some units have also manufactured some equipment themselves while adding some necessary equipment, which speeds up the pace of mechanization and semi-mechanization. A large number of facts fully prove that walking on two legs is a method that is more, faster, better, and more economical.

With clear priorities and specific guidelines, the key lies in fully mobilizing the masses and vigorously launching mass movements. It is not only necessary to mobilize the broad masses of workers to continuously innovate and create, but also to mobilize the masses to actively learn and promote the advanced technical experiences of fraternal enterprises and at home and abroad. This will transform the experience of one person into the experience of one job type, the experience of one group into the experience of the entire factory, and the experience of one factory into the experience of one industry, so that the advanced experience of other regions can blossom and bear fruit in Tianjin. To this end, it is necessary to actively carry out the movement to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, surpass the advanced, and help the backward. According to Tianjin's experience, the best way to promote advanced experience is to carry out technical performance competitions. During the "Technical Innovation Experts Merit Movement" week organized by Hedong District at the end of November, 56 factories, 1,490 groups, and 135,000 people participated in the technical performance competition. The Wang Baofu team of the Second Branch of the Tianjin Steel Plant, through vigorously carrying out a one-stop technical performance competition, increased steel production from 50 tons per shift to 90 tons. Then, they launched a "Luban-style" innovation expert competition. Everyone studied technology, improved equipment and tools, and proposed key solutions to the problem of insufficient supply of steel baking furnaces, such as "60 air curtains for insulation" and "increasing baffles." They also summarized and promoted advanced experiences such as "cross-iron entry," which increased the team's output to 130 tons and 172 tons.

Party organizations and leading cadres at all levels enthusiastically support and encourage the technical innovation proposals put forward by the masses. This is the most important guarantee for promoting the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement. In the early stage of the movement in Tianjin, the district committees convened mobilization rallies, challenge competitions, and on-site meetings to fully mobilize the masses and quickly launch the movement. After the masses were mobilized, they quickly put forward thousands of innovation proposals. The party organizations of various departments, factories, and enterprises immediately incorporated relatively mature proposals into their plans. For those proposals that were not mature or had shortcomings, they pointed out the shortcomings and directions for improvement to the innovators and encouraged them to continue to study, so that the innovation proposals could be perfected. In order to promote the early realization of the innovation proposals put forward by the broad masses of workers, various units adopted the method of the mass line and took a graded approach to handling them according to the size and difficulty of implementation of the proposals. For general innovation proposals, as long as they were approved by the workshop and did not affect product quality and safety, they were handed over to the masses for implementation. For some more important ones, the factory-level organization organized a special force to implement them using the "three-way combination" method. For some major mechanization and semi-mechanization projects that could not be achieved by the strength of one factory, large-scale cooperation between factories was organized to actively achieve them. The Hongqiao District Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed "one factory in difficulty, all factories support, mutual exchange, and giving priority to others before oneself." In November of last year, 89 factories in the district carried out large-scale cooperation, solving 184 major projects, which greatly promoted the process of mechanization and semi-mechanization.

Currently, the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement in Tianjin is continuing to develop extensively and deeply. Starting with vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization, Tianjin is beginning to carry out technical transformation of Tianjin's industry in a planned way, striving to develop towards higher and more sophisticated directions, so that Tianjin, this original industrial base, can contribute more to China's socialist construction.

    大搞群众运动，大搞机械化、半机械化
    中共天津市委工业部长　崔荣汉
    目前，一个以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在天津市各工厂企业中广泛展开。这个规模很大的群众运动，把天津市的增产节约运动推向一个新的阶段，显著地提高了工业的劳动生产率。
    天津市的机械化和半机械化运动，进展十分迅猛，仅仅一个多月的时间，据市内八个区的统计，就提出了近九十万件技术革新建议，并且很快实现了四十五万件。其中重大的机械化、半机械化项目达五千多项。机械化、半机械化运动的开展，对于促进生产和工业的技术改造发挥了重大作用。许多工厂企业机械化程度进一步提高了。据全市市区工业的统计，生产工人机械化操作由年初的25％提高到28％；半机械化操作由18％提高到 24％；手工操作由57％下降到48％。许多工种、工序，成倍、成十倍地提高了生产能力，大大提高了劳动生产率。工人的劳动条件也进一步得到改善，减轻了劳动强度。工人的劳动热情进一步引向苦干与巧干结合，许多工人利用业余时间钻研技术，学习政治、文化。许多工厂不但解决了劳动力不足的现象，而且开始节余了劳动力。天津市和各工业局所制定的规划，在1960年春天全部实现后，全市机械化、半机械化的生产操作将由52％上升到65％，手工操作由48％下降为35％，1960年预计可以节约劳动力近五万人。
    天津市的机械化、半机械化运动所以来势如此迅猛，效果如此显著，不是偶然的。这不仅是因为大搞机械化、半机械化反映了广大职工的热烈愿望，也是生产继续跃进的客观要求。天津市工业虽然几年来技术水平有了很大提高，但是工业技术装备仍然比较落后，大部分工厂仍然是“老兵老枪”。全市生产手工劳动仍占很大比重，而在从事手工劳动中还存在着笨重的操作。随着技术革新和技术革命运动的开展，这种情况越来越不能适应生产高速度发展的要求。
    怎样着手开展机械化、半机械化运动呢？是一下子全面开花，还是有重点地进行？天津市采取了抓住重点带动全面的办法，首先在全市范围内抓住了占有手工劳动、笨重劳动比重较大的起重搬运工、破碎工、铸工、锻工、钳工、包装工等六个工种，和制鞋、织袜、玻璃制品、橡胶制品、纸制品、单机织布等行业为重点，由领导干部集中力量，制定规划，采取措施，对这些工种和行业实行重点突破。短短的一个多月，进展很快，特别是属于薄弱环节的起重搬运的机械化进展最快，背、抬、扛、拉在许多工厂内迅速为车子化、轻轨化、固体运输传送带化、液体运输管道化所代替。天津第一钢厂采用三槽出钢的先进经验以后，产量猛增，但由于搬运起重工人多是手工操作，钢锭运不出去，造成大量积压现象。工人们用四天时间，突击制成了一台龙门吊，使运输效率提高了一倍，突破了生产高速发展的薄弱环节。织袜公司把四百六十二台手摇织袜机改装成电动织袜机，二百三十台手摇织袜机改为电动织机，全公司手工操作由90％下降到40％。1960年不仅不需要增人，目前已经抽出三百多名劳动力支援新厂。
    重点工种、重点行业突破以后，大搞机械化、半机械化的成效和经验，迅速在全市得到传播。于是，由冶金工业、机电工业到化学工业、纺织工业、轻工业的机械化、半机械化运动，很快就全面开花。机械化程度较高的，更上一层楼，实现机械的高速化、连续化、组合化，努力向自动化半自动化方向发展。
    在大搞机械化、半机械化运动中，同样必须贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针。这就是：洋法和土法结合，大型和中、小型结合，国家投资与发动群众挖掘企业潜力相结合，制造新设备和改造旧设备相结合，不断采用新技术和提高工人的操作水平相结合。根据这个方针，各工业局、工业公司、各工厂企业，都制定了大搞机械化、半机械化的规划。市、区各工业局共规划出一千九百多个项目，从1959年冬到1960年春分批实现。在实现这些项目中，我们特别强调“洋土结合，能洋就洋，不能洋就土，先土后洋，逐步提高”，集中力量首先实现那些容易办、花钱少、收效快和生产中迫切需要解决的关键项目。纸制品厂制造水泥袋不能满足需要，厂里本来计划花三十五万元买一台自动扎袋机。工人知道以后，只花了九千元，用木头制成一台机器，效果很好，再搞三台，就可以由现有的六十一个人操作减为五个人操作。也有些单位，在增添一些必要设备的同时，自己制造了一些设备，双管齐下，加快了机械化、半机械化的速度。大量的事实充分证明：两条腿走路是多快好省的办法。
    重点明确，方针也具体，关键就在于充分发动群众，大搞群众运动。不仅要发动广大职工不断革新创造，而且要发动群众积极学习、推广兄弟企业和国内外的先进技术经验。使一个人的经验变成一个工种的，一个小组的经验变成全厂的，一个厂的经验变成一个行业的，使其它地区的先进经验在天津市开花结果。为此，就需要积极开展学先进、赶先进、超先进和帮后进的运动。根据天津市的经验，推广先进经验最好的办法就是开展技术表演赛。河东区11月底组织的一次“技术革新能手立功运动”周中，就有五十六个厂一千四百九十个小组十三万五千多人参加了技术表演赛。天津钢厂二分厂王宝富班，通过大搞一条龙技术表演赛，使钢材生产由班产五十吨提高到九十吨，接着又展开了“鲁班式”的革新能手竞赛，人人钻研技术，改进设备工具，提出了“隔热六十风”“增加挡板”等解决烘钢炉供应不及时的关键，又总结推广了“交义入铁”等先进经验，使班产量再跃进到一百三十吨、一百七十二吨。
    各级党组织和领导干部，对于群众提出的技术革新建议，满腔热情地支持和鼓励，这是推动机械化、半机械化运动的最重要的保证。天津市在开展运动的初期，各区委召开了誓师动员、挑战比武大会和现场会议，充分动员群众，使运动迅速开展起来。群众发动起来之后，很快就提出了成千上万件的革新建议。各部门各工厂企业的党组织，对于比较成熟的建议，就立即纳入规划；对于那些不成熟的建议或者还有缺点的建议，就向革新者指出缺点和努力方向，鼓励他们继续钻研，使革新建议日臻完善。为了促使广大职工提出的革新建议及早实现，各单位采取群众路线的方法，根据建议的大小及实现难易，采取分级处理的办法：对于一般的革新建议，只要经车间批准，在不影响产品质量和安全的条件下，交给群众去实现；对于一些比较重大的，就由厂级组织专门力量，采用“三结合”的办法去实现；对于一些不是一个厂的力量所能实现的重大机械化、半机械化项目，就组织厂与厂之间的大协作来积极实现。中共红桥区委提出“一厂困难，各厂支援，互通有无，先人后己”，全区去年11月份八十九个厂大搞协作，解决了重大项目一百八十四项，大大促进了机械化、半机械化的进程。
    当前，天津市的机械化、半机械化运动正在继续广泛深入地发展，正以大搞机械化、半机械化为起点，开始有计划地对天津工业进行技术改造，努力向高级、精密的方向发展，使天津市这个原有的工业基地，在我国社会主义建设事业中贡献更大的力量。
