    Safe or Dangerous?
    Hua Lu
    Kishi Nobusuke hurriedly ran to the United States to sign and stamp the treasonous treaty. As our Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out in its statement: The signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is an "extremely serious step in which the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries collude with each other to prepare for new aggression and war, threatening peace in Asia and the world." However, the Kishi Nobusuke government's act of treason was carried out under the guise of revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Using "security" as a pretext, while preparing for new wars of aggression in reality, this kind of painted skin is naturally exposed.
      Is the "Security Treaty" truly secure?
    The Japanese people and all peace-loving people around the world can see clearly: The revival of Japanese militarism will bring serious dangers to Japan. It will drag Japan to the brink of war, making Japan directly a henchman of the U.S. aggressive bloc in the Far East. The consequence of doing so is that the direct victims will naturally be the Japanese people. The "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out: "Once war breaks out, Japan will once again become the target of relentless bombing with weapons of mass destruction." "All of this is absolutely incompatible with the security of Japan." In fact, not only is Japan's security threatened, but the security of the entire Asia will inevitably be affected. Recognizing this danger, the Japanese people have held eleven unified actions to carry out unremitting struggles for independence and to defend peace, opposing the war conspiracies of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. Our country and the peace-loving people of the world resolutely support the struggle of the Japanese people, and this struggle will surely achieve victory. This is the true path to security.
    The signing of the "Security Treaty" and the frantic war preparations by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries will only lead the treasonous Japanese government further towards death, reaping the consequences of its own actions. The conspiracies of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are becoming more and more exposed. The Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, and peace will also become more and more widespread and in-depth, and the Kishi Nobusuke government will face an increasingly perilous situation.
    The "Security Treaty"—what security is there to speak of! The Kishi Nobusuke government's treasonous acts are doomed to failure.

    安全还是危险？
    华璐
    岸信介慌慌张张跑到美国在卖国条约上签字画押去了。正如我国外交部在声明中指出的：签订日美军事同盟条约是美日反动派“互相勾结，准备新的侵略和战争，威胁亚洲和世界和平的一个极其严重的步骤。”然而，岸信介政府这一卖国行为，却是在什么修改日美“安全条约”的名义下进行的。以“安全”为名，以准备新的侵略战争为实，这种画皮自然是不揭自破。
      “安全条约”，果真安全吗？
    日本人民和全世界爱好和平的人民看得清楚：日本军国主义的复活，将要给日本带来严重的危险。把日本引向战争的边缘，使日本直接充当美国侵略集团在远东的帮凶。这样做的后果，直接的受害者自然是日本人民。“朝日新闻”指出：“一旦爆发战争，日本又将成为以大规模毁灭手段进行无情轰炸的目标”。“这一切都是同日本的安全绝对不相容的。”其实，这不仅使日本的安全受到威胁，整个亚洲的安全，也必然会受到影响。认清了这种危险性，所以日本人民举行了十一次统一行动，为争取独立、保卫和平进行坚持不懈的斗争，反对美日反动派的战争阴谋。我国和世界爱好和平的人民坚决支持日本人民的斗争，这个斗争一定会取得胜利。这是真正的安全之道。
    “安全条约”的签订，和美日反动派疯狂地准备战争的结果，只能更加使日本卖国政府走向死亡，自食其果。美日反动派的阴谋活动越来越暴露。日本人民争取独立、民主、和平的斗争，也将会越来越广泛，越来越深入，岸信介政府也将越来越面临危难的境地了。
    “安全条约”，谈何安全！岸信介政府的卖国勾当是注定要失败的。
