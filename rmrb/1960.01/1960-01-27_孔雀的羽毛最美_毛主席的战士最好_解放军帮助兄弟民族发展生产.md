　　PLA Helps Brother Nationalities Develop Production
　　(Our Newspaper reports) The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in various regions are vigorously assisting minority nationalities in developing production and raising their material and cultural living standards. The broad masses of officers and soldiers and the people of all nationalities have forged a deep brotherly friendship in the common construction of coastal defense and border regions.
　　Over the past year, the Xinjiang Military Region troops in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains have contributed more than 112,000 labor days. They have worked with the people of all nationalities to rush-repair irrigation canals, tame mountain floods, and eliminate harmful animals, creating favorable conditions for a bumper harvest. At the beginning of last spring, the troops stationed in various areas actively participated in the construction of the irrigation canal systems of the local people's communes in accordance with the requirements of the communes. In June, in order to control the floods of the Kashgar River and the Yarkand River, flood control dikes were built in advance on both banks, saving 720,000 mu of land in the Kashgar region from floods and obtaining an unprecedented bumper harvest. In the severe winter season with heavy snow, the Xinjiang Military Region troops dispatched a large number of laborers to fight the frozen land, assisting the people of all nationalities in vigorously carrying out water conservancy construction, striving for an even greater harvest this year.
　　The troops stationed in the coastal and border areas of southern China have shown the greatest enthusiasm in helping fraternal nationalities develop production. In the Kawa Mountain area, troops must allocate large numbers of manpower and equipment every year to help the Kawa people with production and farmland water conservancy construction. They teach the Kawa people advanced production technologies from the interior, helping them reclaim tens of thousands of mu of fertile land, turning the Kawa Mountain, which was characterized by "slash-and-burn cultivation and poverty among the masses," into a new paradise with " crisscrossing ditches, terraced fields connecting to the sky, no worries about food and clothing, and songs spreading everywhere." Last year, this area achieved a great harvest of rice. The Kucong people, who have lived in the deep mountains and old forests for many years, have also settled down with the help of the Party, the government, and the troops, learning to cultivate fields, transplant rice seedlings, sow wheat, and grow rice, living a stable and happy life. The Kucong people composed songs expressing their gratitude for the Party's concern, saying: "Living in the old forest for thousands of years, who pitied us for our suffering; since the Communist Party came, we have had sweet days with food and clothing." In the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, the troops often publicize the Party's policies to the Yi people, vigorously assisting the masses in accumulating fertilizer, cultivating and harvesting, and helping the Yi people build granular fertilizer factories and reservoirs to solve the Yi people's long-standing difficulty in obtaining drinking water. When the seeds for spring sowing in Qinghai Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, which is located more than 4,000 meters above sea level, could not be transported in time last year, the troops immediately saved grain to support them. When the draft animals were too busy, the troops also took the initiative to help plow and harrow the fields and carry out crash sowing. The troops on the Tibetan Plateau did everything possible to squeeze time to assist the Tibetan people in building roads and bridges, and rebuilding their homes that had been destroyed by the rebel bandits.
　　While helping fraternal nationalities develop production, the broad masses of officers and soldiers also helped the people in many remote areas to run schools, open training classes, establish health and epidemic prevention stations, field medical teams, set up farm tool repair shops, meteorological stations, try out new varieties, and sow the seeds of advanced science and culture. In the Northwest Plateau, the Southwest Border, and the Southeast Coast, the number of cultural schools opened by the troops in cooperation with the local people is increasing year by year. Most of the adult night schools in the Kawa Mountain area were opened by the troops. The school buildings, desks, and benches were also built and made by the officers and soldiers themselves. The teachers are officers and soldiers of the troops, and the teaching aids are also donated by the officers and soldiers. The cultural stations and song and dance troupes organized by the troops in the Qamdo area to help the Tibetan people have brought a new cultural life to the young men and women in many villages. In the Southeast Coast, a group of "sea health workers" trained by the troops for the fishermen has begun to go to sea to perform their tasks.
　　The people of all fraternal nationalities are also doing their best to help the People's Liberation Army. All over the country, there are moving scenes of the people of all fraternal nationalities and the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army being as close as family members. People call the People's Liberation Army "our loved ones," and they hand over their keys to the soldiers to look after their homes when they go out. If they have something good to eat, they also send some to the soldiers to taste. The Wuzhishan People's Commune and the people of the Li and Miao ethnic groups in the mountainous areas of Qiongzhong County vacated more than 20 mu of mature land for the troops to grow vegetables. When the troops needed to conduct intensive training for cultural teachers, the principals and teachers of the commune's primary schools served as instructors in the training team. In the Tibetan region, the Tibetan people not only enthusiastically supported the army in pursuing and annihilating the rebel bandits during the suppression of the rebellion, but after the rebellion was quelled, they showed even more concern for the soldiers stationed on the border, often bringing gifts to the military camps to visit their loved ones. In the Pamir Plateau, Tajik herdsmen persisted in organizing transportation teams during the days when heavy snow blocked the mountains, climbing snow-capped mountains and wading through glaciers to send winter supplies and fodder to the troops. They said: "The peacock's feathers are the most beautiful, and Chairman Mao's soldiers are the best!" "Parents, children, the Liberation Army is even closer. Fish depend on water to survive, and the army and the people love each other heart to heart. Heart to heart, even closer, working together to leap forward, shoulder to shoulder to safeguard peace!"

    解放军帮助兄弟民族发展生产
    本报讯　中国人民解放军驻各地部队大力协助少数民族人民发展生产、提高物质文化生活水平。广大官兵和各族人民在共同建设海防、边疆中，结成了情深谊厚的兄弟友情。
    一年来，在天山南北的新疆军区部队出动了十一万二千多劳动日，他们和各族人民一道赶修水渠，驯服山洪，扑灭害兽，为大好丰收创造了良好条件。去年开春，各地驻军按照当地人民公社的要求，积极参加了公社灌溉渠系统的建设；6月，又为制服喀什噶尔河和叶尔羌河的洪水泛滥，在两岸提前修成防洪堤，使喀什噶尔地区七十二万亩土地免除水患，获得空前丰收。漫天风雪的严寒季节，新疆军区部队又出动大批劳力，和封冻的大地开战，协助各族人民大搞水利建设，力争今年更大的丰收。
    驻守在祖国南方沿海和边疆地区的部队，在帮助兄弟民族发展生产中表现了最大的热情。在佧佤山地区，部队每年都要抽出大批人力、器材，帮助佧佤族人民进行生产和农田水利建设。他们把内地先进的生产技术教给佧佤族人民，帮助他们开垦了成千上万亩良田，使“刀耕火种，群众生活贫困”的佧佤山，变成了“沟渠纵横有，梯田接着天，不愁吃和穿，歌声处处传”的新乐园。去年，这个地区获得了水稻大丰收。长年居住在深山老林中的苦聪人，也在党和政府以及部队帮助下出林定居，学习开田插秧，种麦种稻，过上了安定的幸福生活。苦聪人编歌感激党的关怀说：“住在老林几千年，受苦受难谁可怜；自从来了共产党，有吃有穿日子甜。”在凉山彝族自治州，部队经常向彝胞宣传党的各项政策，大力协助群众积肥、耕种和收割，并帮助彝胞建设颗粒肥料厂，兴建蓄水池，解决彝胞长年吃水困难。当拔海四千米以上的青海玉树藏胞去年春播种籽一时运不到时，部队马上节约粮食去支援他们；耕畜忙不过来，部队也主动到田间帮助拉犁推耙，突击播种。西藏高原部队千方百计挤时间协助藏胞兴修道路、桥梁，重建遭受叛匪毁坏了的家园。
    在帮助兄弟民族发展生产的同时，广大官兵还帮助许多偏僻地区的人民办学校、开训练班、建立卫生防疫站、田间医疗组，创办农具修配所、气象站，试种新品种，播种先进的科学文化种籽。在西北高原，西南边疆，东南沿海，部队协助当地人民开办的文化学校，一年比一年多。佧佤山的大批成人夜校大部分是部队开办的。校舍和桌椅板凳也是官兵自己动手修盖和制造的。教员是部队的官兵，教具也是官兵们捐献的。昌都地区部队帮助藏胞组织的文化站、歌舞队，为许多村寨的男女青年带来了新的文化生活。在东南沿海，部队为渔民培养的一批“海上卫生员”，已经开始下海执行任务了。
    各兄弟民族人民也尽自己的力量帮助解放军。在全国各地，到处都出现兄弟民族人民和解放军官兵之间亲如家人的动人情景。人们把解放军称作“我们的亲人”，他们外出时把钥匙交给战士看家。有好吃的也要送点给战士们尝尝鲜。五指山人民公社和琼中县黎、苗族山区人民腾出熟地二十多亩让给部队种菜。部队要集训文化教员，公社的小学校长、教师都担任了集训队教员。在西藏地区，藏胞们不仅在平叛期间热烈支援大军追歼叛匪，叛乱平息后，他们对驻守边疆的战士更是关怀，经常扶老携幼、带着礼品到军营看望亲人。在帕米尔高原，塔吉克牧民在大雪封山的日子里还坚持组织运输队，爬雪山、涉冰川给部队送过冬物资和草料。他们说：“孔雀的羽毛最美，毛主席的战士最好！”“父母亲，儿女亲，亲上加亲解放军。鱼依水来水养鱼，军民相爱心连心。心连心，亲上亲，携手齐跃进，并肩保和平！”
