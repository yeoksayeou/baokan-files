Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: The Indian Embassy in China's Chargé d'Affaires ad interim, Konnanpillil, held a grand reception at the Beijing Hotel this evening to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of India.

    Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception, where he raised his glass to wish that the friendship between the great peoples of China and India would develop on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    After the reception began, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Konnanpillil spoke first, saying: "Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:
    Today is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of India. At this happy moment, we extend a warm welcome to everyone. Ten years is not very significant in the history of a country. However, for India, these years have been exciting days, during which we have laid the foundations and established a strong and prosperous democratic system.

    Our people are convinced that a socialist order of society must be achieved through planned development. In order to give the freedom we obtained twelve years ago a political form and a social and economic content, our people have worked hard. We are pleased to see that these efforts have achieved great success. Our agricultural production has increased significantly, with output in 1959 increasing by approximately 14% compared to the previous year. Our heavy industry is also developing steadily, and the production of industrial and consumer goods has also increased significantly. In the fields of education, social welfare, healthcare, and worker welfare, significant progress has also been made in these ten years.

    However, we realize that there is still much work to be done. In order to build a modern economy and ensure the social welfare needs of our people, we still need to work hard for many years. As we face this great task, we receive goodwill and encouragement from friends around the world. Many friendly countries have helped and continue to help us in various ways. Therefore, we express our gratitude to them.

    As we transform our society into a modern one through the power of science and technology, we must not only preserve all the best of our heritage but also remain true to our national ideals.

    In accordance with this ideal, we also strive to make some contributions to easing international tensions. In the spirit of friendship to all countries without discriminating against any, we approach every international issue in a spirit of constructive cooperation.

    On this joyous day, it is appropriate to mention the great achievements made by the People's Republic of China in the past ten years. The Chinese leaders and people are concentrating all their efforts on the great cause of national construction, and we admire this dedication and spirit of self-reliance. We wish them great achievements in the future.

    Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen: We are grateful for your participation in tonight's celebration. Now I propose a toast:

    To the health of His Excellency Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, to the continuous prosperity and happiness of the Chinese people and the friendly relations between India and China, and to the friendship between all countries!"

    Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi then spoke, saying: "Mr. Chargé d'Affaires, Comrades, Friends:

    Today, we are very happy to have the opportunity to attend the reception held by Mr. Konnanpillil, Chargé d'Affaires, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of India. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I extend sincere congratulations to the Indian government and people.

    For ten years, the efforts made by the Republic of India in national construction have been a concern of the Chinese government and people. After achieving political independence, Asian and African countries face the serious task of developing their national economies in order to rapidly eliminate the poverty and backwardness caused by long-term colonial rule. We sincerely hope that India and all other Asian and African countries that have achieved independence will succeed in the cause of building their own countries.

    For ten years, China and India have developed friendly relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The friendship between the peoples of the two countries is close. The recent International Agricultural Exhibition in Delhi, where the Chinese Pavilion has been visited by more than one million Indian people in the month and a half since its opening, is a strong proof. Indeed, there are certain historically inherited problems between our two countries, but as long as we follow the Five Principles and conduct peaceful and friendly consultations, any problem between the two countries can be reasonably resolved. At a time when imperialism and reactionaries are doing everything possible to undermine and provoke Sino-Indian relations, we should attach even greater importance to Sino-Indian friendship and continue to maintain and develop the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. This not only serves the interests of the peoples of the two countries but also serves the interests of peace in Asia and the world.

    I propose a toast: to the prosperity of the Republic of India and the happiness of its people, to the friendship between China and India, to the unity of Asian and African countries and world peace, and to the health of His Excellency Dr. Prasad, President of the Republic of India!"

    After the speeches by Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Konnanpillil and Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, the band played the national anthems of China and India respectively.

    This evening, U Ohn Khin, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Burma, and U Ba Lwin, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who are visiting China with Prime Minister Ne Win, were invited to attend the reception. Konnanpillil raised his glass to wish them good health. U Ohn Khin raised his glass to wish India and the Indian people success and prosperity.

    Also present at the reception were Guo Moruo and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Siguang and Bao Erhan, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and heads of various departments of state organs and people from all walks of life in China. Diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China also attended the reception. (Attached photo)

    印度大使馆举行国庆招待会
    周总理到会祝中印人民的友谊在五项原则基础上日益发展
    新华社26日讯　印度驻中国大使馆临时代办康南皮利今晚在北京饭店举行盛大招待会，庆祝印度共和国成立十周年。
    周恩来总理出席了招待会，他在招待会上举杯祝伟大的中印两国人民的友谊在和平共处五项原则的基础上日益发展。
    招待会开始以后，康南皮利临时代办首先讲话，他说：“阁下，女士们，先生们：
  今天是印度共和国成立十周年。在这个高兴的时刻，我们对大家表示热烈的欢迎。十年在一个国家的历史中是不很显著的。但是，对印度来说，这些年代是令人兴奋的日子，我们在这个时期内打下了基础，并且建立了坚强和繁荣的民主制度。
    我国人民确信，必须通过有计划的发展来达到社会主义秩序的社会。为了使得我们在十二年前获得的自由具有一个政治形式，和一个社会和经济的内容，我们人民进行了坚苦的工作。我们高兴地看到，这些努力已取得很大的成就。我们的农业生产有了很大的增长，1959年的产量比前一年增加了约14％。我们的重工业也在稳步发展，工业品和消费品的生产也有了更大的增加。在教育、社会福利、健康事业以及工人福利方面，这十年来也都取得了重要的进展。
    可是，我们意识到还有许多工作要做。为了建成一个现代化经济和保证我国人民社会福利的需要，我们仍需要苦干许多年。当我们面对着这个伟大的任务，我们得到全世界朋友们的善意和鼓舞。许多友好国家曾经并且继续从多方面帮助我们。因此，我们对它们表示感谢。
    在我们通过科学和技术的力量把我们社会变成一个现代化社会的时候，我们不仅要保持我们遗产中一切最好的东西，而且还要忠于我们的民族理想。
    为了符合这种理想，我们也力求对缓和国际紧张局势作出一些贡献。本着对一切国家友好而不歧视任何国家的原则，我们以建设性的合作精神来对待每一个国际问题。
    在这个欢欣的日子，提到中华人民共和国十年来所取得的伟大成就，是适当的。中国领袖们和人民集中全力从事着国家建设的伟大事业，这种一心一意和坚决自立的精神，使我们感到钦佩。祝他们在未来也取得伟大的成就。
    阁下们，女士们，先生们：承大家参加今晚的庆祝会，我们表示感激。现在我提议：
    为中华人民共和国主席刘少奇阁下的健康，为中国人民不断繁荣和幸福以及印中两国的友好关系，为一切国家间的友谊，干杯。”
    陈毅副总理兼外交部长接着讲话说：“代办先生，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们能有机会参加康南皮利代办先生为庆祝印度共和国成立十周年而举行的招待会，感到很高兴。我代表中国政府和人民向印度政府和人民表示诚挚的祝贺。
  十年来，印度共和国在国家建设方面所作的努力，一直是中国政府和人民所关注的。亚非国家在取得了政治上的独立之后，面临着发展民族经济的严重任务，以便迅速地消灭长期殖民统治所造成的贫穷和落后状态。我们衷心地期望印度以及所有已经取得独立的亚非国家在建设自己国家的事业中获得成功。
    十年来，中印两国在和平共处五项原则的基础上发展了友好关系。两国人民的友谊是亲密的，最近在德里举行的国际农业展览会中，中国馆在开幕以来的一个半月中，已经有一百万以上的印度人民来参观，就是一个有力的证明。的确，我们两国之间存在着某些历史上遗留下来的问题，但是只要遵循五项原则，经过和平和友好的协商，两国之间的任何问题都是能够获得合理的解决的。在目前帝国主义和反动派正在千方百计破坏和挑拨中印关系的时候，我们更应以中印友好为重，继续维护和发展两国人民的友谊。这不但符合两国人民的利益，而且也符合亚洲和世界和平的利益。
    我提议：为印度共和国的繁荣和人民的幸福，为中印两国的友谊，为亚非各国的团结和世界和平，为印度共和国总统普拉沙德博士阁下的健康，干杯！”
    在康南皮利临时代办和陈毅副总理兼外交部长讲话以后，乐队分别奏起中国和印度两国的国歌。
    今晚，随奈温总理访问中国的缅甸联邦外交部长吴千吞昂和外交部常任秘书巴林顿等，应邀出席了招待会。康南皮利举杯祝他们身体健康。吴千吞昂举杯祝印度和印度人民的成功和繁荣。
    出席招待会的，还有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若、陈叔通，政协全国委员会副主席李四光、包尔汉，国防委员会副主席张治中，外交部副部长章汉夫等，以及国家机关各部门的负责人和中国各方面的人士。各国驻中国的使节和外交官员也出席了招待会。（附图片）
