    A Good Method for Breeding Piglets Quickly and in Large Numbers
    Soviet Union Promotes Artificial Insemination for Pigs
    Three Major Advantages of Artificial Insemination: 1. Can breed more piglets faster; 2. Reduces the number of boars, lowering costs; 3. Select purebred pigs for semen collection, increasing survival rates.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 13th. The pig artificial insemination method and the artificially insemination equipment developed jointly by the Poltava Pig Breeding Scientific Research Institute of the Ukrainian Republic of the Soviet Union and the All-Union Animal Husbandry Scientific Research Institute have been officially successful. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a special directive to promote it comprehensively throughout the Soviet Union.

    Experiments have proven that the use of artificial insemination to breed piglets is effective. For example, the "Advanced" farm in the Poltava region first tested this method last year, performing single artificial insemination on 175 sows, resulting in 95% of the sows becoming pregnant. In other farms and agricultural enterprises in the state, 879 sows underwent artificial insemination, with a conception rate of 89%. Sows undergoing artificial insemination produced an average of ten piglets per sow. Good results were also obtained in experiments conducted in the Rostov region of the Russian Federal Republic.

    Using artificial insemination has many advantages. The main ones are: First, it can achieve faster and greater reproduction of piglets. Experiments have shown that artificial insemination allows the sperm of one boar to inseminate 200 sows in one breeding period, while natural mating can only inseminate 15. The litter size of sows has also increased. It is estimated that after Rostov region switched to artificial insemination, it can increase pork production by 250,000 to 280,000 quintals per year. Second, it can reduce the large number of boars and reduce production costs. For example, Rostov region currently has 14,000 boars, and using artificial insemination can reduce this number to 2,000 to 3,000, saving 40 million rubles. Third, it can better select and breed, select purebred boars to collect semen for breeding. As a result, the survival rate of the produced piglets is increased, and they grow meat quickly.

    At present, the advanced pig breeding method of artificial insemination has been promoted in Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldova and other republics.

    繁殖仔猪又快又多的好方法
    苏联推广猪的人工授精配种
    人工授精配种三大优越性：一、可以更多更快地繁殖仔猪；二、减少公猪，降低成本；三、挑选纯猪取精，提高成活率。
    新华社莫斯科13日电　苏联乌克兰共和国波尔塔发州养猪科学研究所与全苏畜牧业科学研究所联合试验的猪的人工授精配种方法和试制的人工授精器械已正式成功。苏联农业部最近发出了专门指示，要在全苏各地全面推广。
    试验证明，利用人工授精繁殖小猪效果良好。如波尔塔发州的“先进”农场去年最先试验这种方法，对一百七十五头母猪进行了单次人工授精，结果95％的母猪全部受胎。这个州的其他农庄、农场也有八百七十九头母猪进行了人工授精配种，受胎率达到89％。经过人工授精的母猪每头平均产仔猪十头。在俄罗斯联邦共和国罗斯托夫州进行的试验中也获得了良好结果。
    利用人工授精配种具有许多优越性。主要的有：第一，可以达到更快、更多地繁殖仔猪。试验中证明，利用人工授精能使一头公猪的精子在一个配种期里配二百头母猪，而用自然配种法只能配十五头。母猪的产仔率也提高了。据计算，罗斯托夫州改用人工授精方法后，每年可以增产猪肉二十五到二十八万公担。第二，可以减少大批公猪，降低生产成本。如罗斯托夫州现有一万四千头公猪，利用人工授精，可以减少到二千到三千头，等于节省了四千万卢布。第三，可以更好地选种育种，挑选纯种公猪取精繁殖。因此所产仔猪的成活率提高，长肉迅速。
    现在人工授精的先进养猪方法已在俄罗斯、乌克兰、立陶宛，拉脱维亚、摩尔达维亚等共和国推广起来。
