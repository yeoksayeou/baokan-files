Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 1st: U.S. Secretary of State Herter, in a New Year's message issued yesterday, talked about peace while simultaneously advocating arms expansion. He said, "1960 will be a year with many affairs (for the U.S.) in foreign affairs." Eisenhower "is considering visiting more countries," and "probably in June" will make a return visit to the Soviet Union. Herter said that a summit meeting between East and West is scheduled for May.

Herter listed the "major tasks facing" the United States in the coming year. According to him, these tasks are that the United States and its allies "will explore the possibility of achieving political solutions together with the Soviet Union," that the U.S. "will redouble its efforts to make progress in arms control," and that it will "maintain programs to help emerging nations make progress in freedom."

However, Herter emphasized that despite the emergence of "hopeful new atmospheres," the United States "must not relax its vigilance," and "more than ever, we (the United States) need to maintain our defense." He said, "It must be understood" that "it may take decades to achieve" solutions to world problems. He also slandered that the Communists "have not seen action after words of peace have been uttered."

    赫脱用扩军滥调迎接新年
    新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱在昨天发表的一篇新年祝词中一面谈论和平，一面鼓吹扩军。他说，“1960年（是美国）在对外事务方面事情很多的一年。”艾森豪威尔“正在考虑更多地访问其他国家”，并且“大概是在6月”进行对苏联的回访。赫脱说，东西方最高级会议已预定在5月间举行。
    赫脱列举了美国在今后一年中“面临的重大任务”。据他说，这些任务是美国和它的盟国“将同苏联一道探索取得政治解决的可能性”，所谓美国“将加倍努力争取在武器控制方面取得进展”，以及“保持援助新兴国家在自由中取得进展的计划”。
    然而，赫脱强调说，尽管出现了“有希望的新气象”，美国“决不可放松警惕”，而且“比以往任何时候都更需要保持我们（美国）的防务”。他说，“必须了解”，“很可能需要若干年代的时间才能实现”世界问题的解决。他还污蔑说，共产党“在和平的言词发表以后并没有见到行动”。
