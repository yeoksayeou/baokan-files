Mr. Speaker, Members of the Eighty-Sixth Congress, Fellow Citizens:

Seven years ago, when I began my current office, I cherished a long-held determination above all else. I was determined then, and remain determined now, to make the United States an increasingly powerful force dedicated to the cause of peace—recognizing that peace cannot be something we enjoy alone, but something all peoples everywhere enjoy. This determination is shared by the entire Congress, indeed by all Americans.

Today, I want to talk about certain aspects of the state of the United States, both domestically and in its relations with other countries.

First, I want to point out that, for us, this annual self-examination has become a necessity, for we now live in a divided world maintaining an unstable equilibrium, and we on our part are determined to protect ourselves and counter the aggression of the other side.

In a situation where both sides of this divided world possess weapons of incredible destructive power, humanity approaches a state where mutual annihilation becomes possible. No fact in the world today is more important than this—it influences all our words, plans, and actions.

The demand placed on us now is to remain vigilant, to have determination, and to dedicate every bit of our strength to providing adequate security, especially a real deterrent force sufficient to prevent aggression. These are precisely the things we are doing.

All these facts underscore the importance of relentless efforts to achieve a just peace.

Only by strengthening the spiritual, intellectual, economic, and defensive strength of the free world can we move towards this goal with confidence.

Secondly, we note that recent Soviet behavior and statements suggest the possibility of a period of somewhat reduced tension in relations between the Soviet Union and the free world. If these statements are sincere, there is greater hope that the intensity of past confrontations can gradually lessen, and ultimately persuasion can replace coercion. Whether this will become an era of lasting hope remains to be tested by actions.

Thirdly, we now stand at the gateway to a great new age of technology—an age which, despite its capacity to destroy humanity, also has the ability to make poverty and human suffering a thing of the past. If our efforts are wisely directed—if our relentless efforts to secure a reliable peace begin to achieve some success—then we can certainly participate in creating an era characterized by justice and continuously improving levels of human happiness.

In the past year, the Soviet Union has expressed concern about measures to reduce the danger of common war.

Although neither we nor any other nation in the free world can allow ourselves to be deceived by fine promises that have not yet been proven in action, our attitude towards this apparent new opportunity is extremely serious. We must strive to break the highly damaging cycle of disappointment and crisis, which, if unchecked, could lead to nuclear catastrophe: utter madness.

Although it is obvious to both sides that reliable agreements are needed to ensure that disputes are not resolved by force, we cannot expect sudden, revolutionary results, just as in other issues that create divisions between peoples and nations. We must find somewhere to start.

An obvious path where a beneficial beginning can be made is to expand exchanges between the peoples of our two countries. In this regard, there are countless opportunities—most of which we are all well aware of—to develop mutual understanding, which is the true foundation of peace, if both sides are willing.

Another avenue might lie in the resumption on January 20 of negotiations aimed at a supervised ban on nuclear weapons testing. Unfortunately, the final statement of the Soviet scientists who met with our scientists in Geneva to establish a mutually agreed basis for a ban on testing, but without success, made it clear that they had been drawing conclusions based on political considerations. The conclusions of the British and American scientific representatives, on the other hand, were their own freely formed, personal, and collective opinions. I hope that when the new negotiations begin, the guiding light of the discussion will be truth, not political speculation.

Another avenue can be found in disarmament, in which the Soviet Union has claimed to be ready for serious negotiations. However, they have not clearly indicated what plans, if any, they may have regarding mutual inspection and verification—a necessary condition for any comprehensive disarmament measures.

In one instance, our peace initiative has recently been successful. A multilateral treaty signed last month provides for an inspection system to ensure that Antarctica is used only for peaceful purposes. The treaty provides for free, cooperative scientific research on that continent, and prohibits nuclear explosions there, pending a universal international agreement on the issue. This treaty is a major contribution to peace, international cooperation, and scientific progress. I will submit the treaty to the Senate for consideration and ratification in the near future.

The United States has always been ready to join the Soviet Union in serious discussions on these or any other issues that might lead to a just peace.

Of course, there is no need to reiterate that the United States has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of any country; similarly, we oppose any attempt to impose its system by force or subversion on the people of our country or other countries.

This concern for the freedom of other peoples is an intellectual and spiritual cohesion that binds us to more than forty other nations in a common defensive effort. We have never forgotten that our own destiny is inextricably linked to the destinies of these nations; we will never act in any way that would jeopardize the solemn obligations we have undertaken to them.

Of course, we and our friends are concerned about self-defense. Because of this concern, we recognize that the progress and freedom of the non-aligned, emerging nations are of great interest to all the peoples of the free world. The people of these countries urgently desire to obtain an adequate standard of living and must not, through our negligence, be forced to seek assistance from those who declare hostility to freedom, and ultimately become servants of these people in practice.

We must not fail to provide them with the necessary technical and investment assistance, thereby frustrating their natural desire to improve their lives. This is a problem to be solved not only by the United States, but by every nation that cherishes the same ideals and is able to provide assistance.

In recent years, the partners and friends of the United States in Western Europe and Japan have made great economic progress. Their newly acquired economic strength eloquently demonstrates the outstanding success of our and their policy of economic cooperation.

The international economy of 1960 is significantly different from that of the first few years after the war. The United States is no longer the only major industrial nation capable of providing the large amounts of resources urgently needed by emerging nations.

To enjoy security and prosperity, wealthy nations must give their less fortunate members the kind of cooperation that can inspire hope, confidence, and progress. A wealthy nation can temporarily indulge itself without apparent harm, making the material ease and comfort of its own citizens its sole goal—thereby denying its own interests in a peaceful, prosperous international family, both spiritually and materially. But in the long run, the hostility it will incur, the isolation it will fall into, the domestic spiritual and physical weakness that will arise—all this will bring it disaster.

The United States did not become great through weakness and self-indulgence. Its miraculous progress and achievements arose from other, far more valuable and important qualities, which are:

—Adherence to principles and methods consistent with our religious ideas

—Willingness to work diligently

—Willingness to make sacrifices for worthwhile causes

—Courageously addressing every challenge encountered in its progress

—Intellectual honesty and the ability to recognize the true path to obtaining its own greatest benefit.

For us and for all nations of the free world, rich and poor alike, these qualities are needed today more than ever if we are to move forward together towards greater security, prosperity, and peace.

I believe that industrial nations are willing to actively participate in supplementing the efforts being made by developing nations to achieve progress.

The tensions in our international balance of payments underscore the urgent need for such cooperation. In recent years, the surplus we have earned from foreign commercial transactions has been far from sufficient to cover the expenses we need abroad to maintain our military presence overseas, provide private investment funds, and provide assistance to underdeveloped countries. In 1959, our balance of payments deficit approached four billion dollars.

If deficits as large as this continue to occur, they will, after some time, harm our own economic development and prevent the free world from moving forward.

We must seek to continuously increase exports and world trade to cope with this situation. In addition, we must encourage all industrialized nations of the free world to engage in new cooperation together to help those less fortunate nations escape the misery of poverty. This will better share the burden and lead to more beneficial trade.

New nations, as well as other nations striving to address the issue of development, can only achieve progress if they demonstrate confidence in their own destiny and have the will to realize their destiny, and use their own human and material resources to achieve it. Furthermore, progress in national transformation can only be achieved gradually—there is no easy shortcut from oxcarts to jet aircraft. However, just as we relied on European aid in our early days, those emerging nations that now hold such confidence and determination should also be helped.

In the past fifteen years, twenty nations have gained political independence. Each year, some more nations gain political independence. Most of these countries unfortunately lack the technical capabilities and investment capital; without the support of the free world in these areas, they cannot effectively progress in freedom.

Regarding their needs, one of our main focal points of concern is the South Asian region. Here, in just two countries alone, nearly half a billion people are working, working diligently, to raise their living standards, and in doing so, make themselves a powerful bulwark against the expansion of an ideology that would destroy freedom.

I cannot express to you how deeply I believe that, for our own benefit and the benefit of the free world, we must cooperate with others to help these people realize the legitimate ambitions they have expressed in their various multi-year plans. We must resolutely face this enormous challenge through the World Bank and other institutions, and through individual actions by every country capable of providing assistance.

Of course, we must all recognize that development in freedom for emerging nations is by no means simply a matter of obtaining external financial assistance. An indispensable element in this process is that these countries consistently and resolutely exercise the national discipline necessary for any long-term development period. This determination is particularly important because the process of improvement will inevitably be gradual and arduous, not revolutionary. Moreover, everyone must recognize that the development process is by no means a short-term phenomenon. Even nations with the most favorable conditions take many years.

I will continue to ask the American people, for their own security, prosperity, and peace, to ensure that their own part in this enormous plan receives full and willing support. The decision of the free world on this issue may bring about different outcomes, potentially leading the world to disaster, or enabling the world to progress in freedom.

Other countries have similar needs, and I visited some of these countries last month.

It is appropriate to establish a common meeting place for those nations willing to provide assistance in development work. In the past year, I have discussed this matter with the leaders of several Western nations.

The Organization for European Economic Cooperation, with its rich experience, can help to conduct initial studies, with the goal of utilizing all the available economic power of the industrialized free world—especially private investment capital. But I say again, no matter how great this assistance, it can only be permanently effective if used to supplement the strength of the spirit and will of the people of emerging nations.

We hope that by providing this assistance, we will enable these countries to enthusiastically rally under the banner of freedom. There is no more striking contrast than with the gloomy system of satellite states.

If we seize this opportunity to establish an era of fruitful partnership between less fortunate nations and nations that have already achieved a high degree of economic development, then we will brighten the prospects for establishing a world order based on security, freedom, and peace. Otherwise, the prospects may indeed be bleak. We may be facing a turning point in history, and we must act decisively.

As a nation, we can only successfully pursue these goals from a position of strength with a broad base.

No matter how eagerly we seek a guaranteed peace, we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness while negotiating on arms reduction. Until concrete, mutually implementable measures of arms reduction are formulated, we will never weaken the means of defending our system.

The United States possesses a formidable defense force. After careful consideration, I believe that unless we are foolish enough to neglect the defense forces that we now so powerfully support, no country would risk a major war with us. The whole world knows that if any country today were to be unable to restrain itself from attacking the United States, it would itself quickly suffer terrible destruction, although our country might also suffer significant losses. But I again assure the people of all countries and all nations that the United States will never use this destructive power except for defense.

In the past year, our long-range striking power has gained a new force as the "Atlas" intercontinental ballistic missile has become practically available. Today, our long-range striking power is unmatched in manned bombers. In the fourteen recent test launches over ranges of more than five thousand miles, the "Atlas" hit within an average of less than two miles of the target. This is shorter than a jet runway—completely within the range of total destruction. Such achievements should be credited to American scientists and engineers, who have had to make full use of time and technology in the past five years to trial-produce these long-range ballistic missiles that the United States had not previously possessed.

In addition, an increasing number of nuclear-powered submarines will join our active forces this year, some of which will be equipped with "Polaris" missiles. These outstanding ships and weapons, distributed across the oceans, are capable of accurately hitting targets almost anywhere on Earth. These ships are impossible to destroy by surprise attack, and thus they will become one of our finest sentinels of peace.

To deal with situations that do not reach the level of full-scale nuclear war, we continue to maintain our aircraft carrier forces, our numerous overseas forces, our ever-ready Army strategic forces and Marine Corps divisions, as well as non-military personnel. Keeping these forces consistently modernized is an expensive but necessary process, which is scheduled to proceed at a pace that can continuously strengthen our country's strength.

The presence of some of these forces on land and at sea outside our country convincingly demonstrates our determination to defend collective security alongside our allies. Furthermore, I have directed that steps be taken to arrange our military assistance to these allies on a more long-term basis. This is necessary for establishing a more sound collective defense system.

Next, I want to talk about our efforts in space exploration, which are often mistakenly regarded as an inseparable part of defense research and development work.

First, the United States has made great contributions to the world's rich knowledge in celestial body science and space science in the past two years. The scientific community is currently primarily concerned with these discoveries; however, these discoveries are important cornerstones for the broader exploration of outer space with a view to ultimately benefiting all mankind.

Second, our military missile program, which we are successfully implementing, is not impaired by our current lack of very large rocket engines, which are very much needed for long-range space exploration. Experts have assured me that the thrust of our current missiles is sufficient to meet defense needs.

Third, the United States is working to develop giant rocket engines with a view to sending much heavier vehicles into space for exploration.

Fourth, at the same time, it must be remembered that we are only just beginning to explore the space that closely surrounds the Earth. We are using launch systems that are currently available to develop artificial satellites to detect the world's climate, develop artificial satellite relay stations to promote and expand communications around the world, to aid navigation, to provide ships and aircraft with precise locations, and to improve the tools for collecting and broadcasting the information we seek. In this lies the greatest hope for the good application of space technology at an early date.

Fifth, our new space law has only had one year of experience since its implementation. I believe it has some shortcomings in certain specific aspects, and recommendations for improvement will be made soon.

To accomplish the many tasks I have mentioned, it is necessary to continuously strengthen the spiritual, intellectual, and economic strength of American life. The steadfast goal of our society is to ensure that everyone receives fair treatment before God. We must always remain vigilant lest freedom wither away because of the accumulation of inadvertent restrictions or the lack of courage to boldly address the great problems of the present.

A year ago, when I met with you, our country was emerging from an economic downturn, although the signs of renewed prosperity were not convincing enough for skeptics at the time. Today, our soaring strength is obvious to everyone. 1960 holds the promise of becoming the most prosperous year in our country's history.

However, we continue to be harassed by troubling disruptions.

Among the current problems that need to be resolved are:

—The need to protect the public interest in prolonged labor-management stalemates;

—A situation where one sector of American agriculture consistently refuses to address a vitally important problem;

—The persistent threat of inflation, and the ever-present tendency towards financial irresponsibility;

—In some instances, some of our citizens do not receive equal protection under the law.

Every American has been disturbed by the prolonged dispute in the steel industry and the long delay in reaching a solution.

We are all comforted by the fact that a solution has finally been reached in this industrial sector. In terms of percentage, the increase in labor costs for steel companies under this solution is less than in any previous solution since the end of World War II. It is also gratifying to note that, despite increased wages and benefits, several major steel manufacturers have announced that there will be no increase in current steel prices. The national interest requires that, during this period of industrial peace guaranteed by this new contract, both labor and management make every possible effort to increase efficiency and productivity in steel manufacturing in order to avoid raising prices.

One of the lessons of this situation is that the potential danger to the nation of strikes that last longer and are larger in scale must be addressed. To ensure that this possibility does not arise, we must, of course, first rely on the reason of responsible individuals. I intend to encourage both labor and management to engage in regular discussions outside the negotiating table to consider not only their common interests in maintaining industrial peace, price stability, and economic development, but also the public interest in doing so.

In my view, if we cannot establish voluntary, reliable, and lasting cooperation among some important sectors of our own free society, it is almost absurd for the United States to recognize the necessity of establishing cooperation among nations and to earnestly seek such cooperation.

Failure to address basic issues in other areas besides labor and management may place serious pressure on the solid pillars of freedom in our society.

I believe that agriculture is one such area.

Our basic agricultural laws were formulated twenty-seven years ago as an emergency effort to eliminate the difficulties caused by the worldwide depression. During World War II, these laws continued to be maintained in order to encourage the production of food necessary to sustain the severely war-torn free world—the economic anomalies created by these laws were aggravated.

Today, our agricultural problems are completely different. Today, the problem is to make effective adjustments to adapt to the changes brought about by the scientific revolution. When the original agricultural laws were formulated, the wheat produced per hour of agricultural labor was only a quarter of what it is today. The agricultural laws are completely outdated, ineffective, and costly.

For several years, we have maintained an outdated system that not only fails to protect agricultural income, but also creates increasingly aggressive surpluses. The United States has long been at peace, but we have allowed our farms to continue producing what was needed during wartime.

I again urge Congress to enact legislation to bring production more closely in line with the market, make it easier to deal with costly surpluses, give agricultural operations greater freedom, and continuously increase net agricultural income.

Another problem we must face is the problem of living within our means. This requires limiting spending, constantly reassessing the priorities of projects, and maintaining stable prices.

We must prevent inflation. This is an enemy that is so well disguised that it is sometimes difficult to recognize. But the need to stop the continued general rise in prices is obvious—a need that we can all see and feel.

Preventing rising costs and prices requires every citizen to practice self-restraint. No individual, city, state, or organized group can escape the obligation to resist inflation. Because every American pays a heavy price for it.

The damage caused by inflation is endless. The increase in the prices of goods we sell abroad threatens to drive us out of markets that were once firmly ours. Whether high, uncompetitive domestic prices are caused by demands for excessive profits or by increases in labor costs exceeding increases in productivity, the end result is severely damaging to the nation.

We must fight inflation like a fire threatening our homes. Only by doing so can we prevent it from destroying our salaries, savings, pensions, and insurance, and prevent it from eroding the foundations of a free, healthy economy and national security.

One of the main ways the federal government can combat inflation and rising prices is to ensure that its expenditures are less than its revenues. The debt we currently face is approximately two hundred and ninety billion dollars. With interest alone now costing taxpayers about nine and a half billion dollars, it is clear that the growth of this debt must be stopped. You will be pleased to hear that despite the unsettling effects of the recent steel strike, we estimate that our accounts will show a surplus of close to two hundred million dollars by June 30 of this year.

I will present a balanced budget for 1961 to Congress. Defense spending continues to maintain the unprecedented levels of peacetime of the past few years. With one exception, spending in every major category of health, education, and welfare will remain at or exceed last year's levels. Spending in space nearly doubles. The overall basis of this budget is the needs of the nation—not considerations of the insistence of specific groups, localities, or politicians.

Increases in spending beyond the above are largely due to increased costs for legislation previously implemented.

I repeat, this budget will be a balanced budget. Expenditures will be seventy-nine billion eight hundred million dollars. The amount by which revenue exceeds expenditure (called a surplus in the budget) is four billion two hundred million dollars, which will be used to repay our national debt. I personally believe that as long as the nation has a debt, no part of the money can properly be called a "surplus." I would rather see this money as "reducing the mortgage inherited by our children." Once we make this payment a normal practice, we will be able to advantageously improve our tax structure, thereby truly alleviating the heavy tax burden.

In any event, such a reduction will save taxpayers approximately two hundred million dollars in interest each year.

This budget will help ease pressure on our credit and capital markets. It will strengthen the confidence of people around the world in our economic and monetary strength and in our ability, individually and collectively, to act responsibly financially.

In managing the massive public debt, the Treasury Department is unfortunately hampered by artificial obstacles. Due to Congress's unwillingness to remove some outdated restrictions, the Treasury Department's ability to deal with these difficult issues is greatly weakened. There is an even more urgent need today for greater freedom in debt management, because the cost of some of the inappropriate financial measures that the Treasury Department has had to take is increasing. In my legislative proposals, I place great importance on removing this obstacle.

There is also the issue of civil rights.

In the better world that we hope and plan to achieve, we all recognize that we must fight against local and racial prejudices. From the long-term perspective of history, the right to vote has always been one of the most powerful pillars of a free society. Despite constitutional guarantees, and despite the great progress made in recent years, some people in our country are still unable to obtain equal protection under the law due to prejudice.

At the beginning of your last session, I presented legislation that could help eliminate several practices that discriminate against Americans' fundamental rights. The Civil Rights Commission has added some constructive suggestions. I hope that these suggestions will be included among the issues that this session will give serious consideration. I believe that Congress will thereby show the world that our government is working to achieve equality before the law for all our people.

Our country continues to experience profound changes and developments in many ways each year.

In the past eighteen months, we have welcomed two new states—Alaska and Hawaii—into the Union. We salute these two stars in the west with pride.

Our vigorous development is multifaceted, and we all welcome it as a sign of health and vitality. For example, we now see that large urban areas are developing rapidly.

By 1975, the area of America's large urban areas will be twice what it is today. The list of urban problems they must address is staggering. These problems involve water supply, keeping the air clean, adjusting local tax systems, providing necessary educational, cultural, and social service institutions, and destroying the conditions that breed fault and crime.

In addressing these problems, if we cherish our country's historically significant freedoms, we must remain within the traditions of our federal system, which distributes power between the national government and state governments. Because this system is unique, casual observers may find it incomprehensible, but it has been effectively implemented for nearly two hundred years.

I have no doubt that our urban problems and other troublesome issues can be resolved in the traditional American way. In resolving these issues, we must understand that accepting the deceptive lure of "easy" federal tax revenues cannot truly solve any problems, but instead will cause destructive trends.

Our education system provides a ready example. Everyone recognizes the extreme need for modern school facilities, highly qualified and properly compensated teachers, and the extreme need to adopt the best educational methods and curricula. We cannot be complacent in educating our youth.

However, the way to better train people's minds does not lie in the federal government's rapid provision of short-term or long-term financial assistance. The process of education is primarily a local and individual responsibility, and emergency, centralized action by the government cannot make much progress in this process.

The government has put forward a carefully considered plan to help eliminate current deficiencies. The purpose of this plan is to encourage the construction of classrooms, not by replacing state and local funding with federal funding, but by taking stimulus measures to expand and encourage state and local efforts. This approach rejects the idea of federal government control or dominance. It is feasible and should be in line with the hearts of every American who is concerned about developing our country's education system in the traditional American way. I urge Congress to take action on this issue.

I would like to reiterate the recommendation I made on another issue in my State of the Union address last January. At that time, I informed Congress that I intended to intensify our efforts to replace force with the international rule of law. Based on numerous discussions abroad, I am deeply convinced that the people of other countries and other nations around the world share the same goal universally and deeply.

In that address, I pointed out that our work would include re-examining our own relationship with the International Court of Justice. This court was established by the United Nations to adjudicate international legal disputes between countries. In 1946, we recognized the court's jurisdiction, but reserved the right to unilaterally decide whether a matter fell essentially within domestic jurisdiction. There is now a proposal in the Senate to abolish our current self-judgment reservation. I support this proposal and urge its speedy passage. If it is passed, I intend to ask the members of the United Nations to give similar recognition to the jurisdiction of this court.

Here, in this final year of my term, it may not be inappropriate for me to say a few words to the members of Congress about the significance of the relationship between the institutions we each represent and our two branches for the days to come.

I am not the only president to work with a Congress controlled by the opposition party—only no other president has worked for as long as I have, but in terms of personal and official relations, we have all experienced the storms of the past five years. I am very grateful for this.

In the next twelve months, before my successor takes office, I am deeply concerned about the shared responsibilities of our country's Congress and government to ourselves and other countries. I will take action based on the beliefs I have expressed here today, and devote all my energy to completing the current tasks, whether those tasks require visits to promote greater understanding in the world, negotiations aimed at reducing international disputes, or frequent discussions and contacts with Congress and the American people on domestic and foreign issues.

To achieve these goals, I expect, and will single-mindedly maintain, close and constructive ties with Congress.

Every minute spent on unimportant quarrels between the legislative and executive branches means that we lose a minute of precious time to wisely formulate and implement coherent policies aimed at our nation's survival and progress.

What we seek is a common goal—to provide better opportunities for our own people and a world of justice and peace for all.

Before us and our friends is an ideological challenge, an ideology that has been proclaiming its purpose abroad for more than forty years, which is to ultimately prevail over all forms of government that are inconsistent with its own government.

We know that, no matter how opposed we are to the doctrine of imperialistic communism, it is a huge enterprise grimly pursued by some leaders who force their people to subordinate freedom of action and spirit and their individual desires for some hoped-for benefit in the future.

The Communists can put forward a series of material achievements made in the past fifteen years, giving a false persuasiveness to the many fine promises they have made to the people of non-aligned countries.

The competition they bring is extremely fierce.

But in our scale of values, we put freedom first—the existence and development of our entire country is closely linked to this basic concept, and this existence and development is the reason why we have taken over the leadership of the free world. This is the most valuable thing any country can have. This is something the Communists can never provide. The history of the material achievements made by the United States in freedom is written not only in our own country's unprecedented prosperity, but also in the billions of dollars we have provided to rebuild the economies of the free world destroyed by World War II, and in the billions of dollars of effective assistance we have spent to save the independence of many other countries threatened by external rule. There is no doubt that we have the ability to handle the problems of the new era of world history that we are now entering.

But we must use this ability wisely and tirelessly, regardless of the personal sacrifices we make.

The cracks that divide our political planet are both deep and wide.

Moreover, we live in an ocean of semantic confusion, in which old nouns no longer faithfully convey meaning.

Police states are called "people's democracies."

Forcible conquest of free peoples is called "liberation."

These fraudulent slogans make the problem of conveying true beliefs, facts, and convictions even more difficult.

We must clearly explain our peaceful intentions, our desire for a better world. In doing so, we must use language to clarify ideas, not to use language as a tool for deliberately making innuendo attacks and distorting the truth.

And we must abide by what we say.

In my recent visits to distant countries, I found one politician after another eagerly telling me that their governments have borrowed some elements from our American constitution and the unbreakable ideals established in our Declaration of Independence.

As a nation, we pride ourselves on the fact that our own constitutional system and the ideals that support it have long been seen as a source of freedom.

We must make ourselves worthy of this trust with our every action, always aware that seemingly minor erosions of freedom gradually accumulate and can destroy the entire structure of a free society.

With such a belief, we will undertake the tasks before us.

With such a dedication and belief in Almighty God, mankind will one day achieve the unity in freedom that people have longed for since ancient times.

Dwight D. Eisenhower

### 艾森豪威尔1月7日向美国国会提出的国情咨文

1960-01-21
第5版()
专栏：

    艾森豪威尔1月7日向美国国会提出的国情咨文两位议长先生，第八十六届国会议员们，同胞们：
    七年前我开始担任我目前的职务时，我怀有一个长期怀抱的超越其他一切之上的决心。我当时下定决心、现在仍然下定决心，要使美国成为一支越来越强大的致力于和平事业的力量——认识到和平不能是单单我们自己享有的东西，而且是各地的人民享有的东西。这个决心是整个国会、的确全体美国人所共有的。
    今天我想谈谈美国在国内和它同别国的关系方面的状况的某些特点。
    首先，我要指出，对我们来说，每年一次的自我检查已经成为肯定是必要的事，因为我们现在生活在一个保持着不稳定的平衡的分裂的世界中，而我们方面则一心要保护自己和对付对方的侵略。
    在这个分裂的世界的双方都拥有破坏力量令人难以置信的毁灭性武器的情况下，人类接近了一种相互毁灭成为可能的状态。今天世界上再没有其他事实比这个事实更为重要的了——它影响着我们的一切言论、计划和行动。
    现在对我们提出的要求是要保持警惕，要有决心，要奉献出我们的任何一点力量，来提供充分的安全、特别是足以阻止侵略的真正威慑力量。这些正是我们在做的事情。
    这一切事实强调说明了为争取正义的和平而进行不懈的努力的重要性。
    只有加强自由世界的精神、思想、经济和防御方面的力量，我们才能满怀信心地朝着这个目标前进。
    其次，我们注意到，苏联最近的行为和言论表明在苏联和自由世界的关系方面有可能开始出现一个紧张程度有所缓和的时期。如果这些言论是真诚的话，过去的对抗的激烈程度就有较大的希望逐渐减少，最后能以说服代替威压。这是否会成为有着持久的希望的时代，还有待行动来考验。
    第三，我们现在正站在一个伟大的、新的工艺时代的大门口——这个时代尽管有毁灭人类的能力，同样也有使得贫困和人类痛苦一去不复返的能力。如果我们努力的方向是明智的——如果我们为争取可靠的和平而作的不懈的努力开始取得某些成就——那末我们就肯定能够参加缔造一个以正义和人类幸福的水平不断提高为特征的时代。
    过去一年间，苏联对减少共同的战争的危险的措施表示了关心。
    虽然无论是我们还是自由世界的其他任何国家都不能允许自己被一些还没有在行动中得到证明的动听的诺言所迷惑，然而我们对待这个显然是新的机会的态度是极其认真的。我们必须努力打破那种失望和危机的十分有害的循环，这种循环如果不加以制止的话，可能导致核灾难：极度的疯狂。
    需要有可靠的协议来保证不会用武力解决争端虽然对双方来说都是很明显的，然而，就像在其他使人们和国家之间产生分歧的问题上一样，我们不能期望有突然的、革命性的结果。我们必须找到某个地方作为起点。
    一条可以从那里作出有益的开端的明显的道路是扩大我们两国人民之间的交往。在这方面，如果双方都愿意的话，是有无数的机会——其中大部分是我们大家都清楚知道的——可以发展相互的了解的，而相互的了解是和平的真正的基础。
    另一个途径可能在于在1月20日重新举行设法有监督地禁止核武器试验的谈判。不幸，在日内瓦同我们的科学家一起开会为禁止试验建立一个一致同意的基础但是没有成功的苏联科学家们的最后声明，使人清楚地感觉到，他们一直是根据政治考虑得出结论的。英国和美国的科学代表们的结论则是他们自己自由形成的、个人的和集体的意见。我希望，在新的谈判开始的时候，讨论的指路灯将是真理，而不是政治上的投机。
    在裁军方面还可以找到另外一个途径，在这方面苏联已经声称准备进行认真的谈判。然而，他们一直没有清楚表明他们可能有的关于相互视察和查核——这是任何广泛的裁军措施的必要条件——的计划，如果有任何这样的计划的话。
    在一个事例中，我们的和平倡议在最近取得了成功。在上月签订的一项多边条约规定由一个视察制度来保证南极洲只用于和平目的。这项条约规定在那个洲进行自由的、合作的科学研究，并禁止在那里进行核爆炸，以待就这个问题达成普遍的国际协议。这项条约对和平、国际合作和科学的进步是一个重大的贡献。我将在最近的将来把这项条约提交参议院考虑和批准。
    美国始终准备同苏联一起参加关于这些或其他任何可能导向正义的和平的问题的认真讨论。
    当然无需重申美国无意干涉任何国家的内政；同样我们反对任何企图用武力和颠覆活动把它的制度强加于我们或其他国家的人民的尝试。
    这种对其他国家的人民的自由的关怀是一种思想上和精神上的凝聚力，它使我们同其他四十多个国家结成联盟进行共同的防御努力。我们一刻也没有忘记，我们自己的命运是同这些国家的命运紧紧地联系在一起的；我们决不会以任何会危及我们对他们承担的庄严义务的方式行事。
    当然，我们和我们的朋友是关心自卫的。由于这种关心，我们认识到，未承担义务的、新兴的国家的进步和自由同自由世界的全体人民有重大的利害关系。这些国家的人民迫切希望获得适当的生活水平，决不能由于我们的疏忽而迫使他们从那些宣布敌视自由的人那里得到援助，最后实际上成为这些人的仆从。
    决不能不给它们技术和投资方面的必要援助，从而使它们希望改善生活的自然愿望遭到挫折。这是一个不仅仅由美国来解决、而且要由每一个珍视同样的理想并且能够提供援助的国家来解决的问题。
    最近若干年以来，美国在西欧的伙伴和朋友以及日本在经济上得到很大的进步。它们新得到的经济力量雄辩地说明我们和他们奉行的经济合作政策取得了突出的成就。
    1960年的国际经济跟战后最初几年的国际经济有显著的不同。美国不再是能够提供新兴国家迫切需要的大量资源的唯一重要工业国了。
    为了使自己享受安全和繁荣，富有的国家必须给不那末幸运的成员以能够引起希望、信心和进步的那种合作。一个富裕的国家可以暂时在不使自己遭到明显的损害的情况下采取放纵自己的做法，把它自己的公民在物质上的安逸和舒适当做它的单一的目标——从而否定了一个和平的、繁荣的国际大家庭在精神上和物质上同它自己的利害关系。但是从长期看，它将会遭到的敌视、它将会陷于的孤立地位、将会产生的国内精神上和身体上的孱弱——这一切将会给它带来灾难。
    美国并不是通过孱弱和放纵自己而变得伟大的。它的奇迹般的进步和成就是从其他有价值和重要得多的品质产生的，这些品质是：
    ——恪守同我们的宗教思想一致的原则和方法
    ——乐于辛勤地工作
    ——愿意为有价值的事业作出牺牲
    ——勇敢地对付它的进步遇到的每一个挑战
    ——思想上诚实并且能认识获得它自己的最大利益的真正道路。
    对我们和对自由世界的不分贫富的一切国家来说，这些品质在今天比在过去任何时候更为需要，如果我们要在一起向更大的安全、繁荣与和平迈进的话。
    我相信，工业国愿意积极参加补充正在进行建设的国家为取得进步而作的努力的工作。
    我们国际收支方面的紧张状况强调说明迫切需要这种合作。近年来，我们从对外商业交易中获得的盈余，远不够支付我们在国外为保持我们在海外的军事力量、提供私人投资的款项和对不发达国家提供援助所需要的开支。1959年，我们的收支逆差接近四十亿美元。
    如果继续出现像这样大的逆差，过一些时候将会损害我们自己的经济发展，并且使自由世界不能前进。
    我们必须设法使输出和世界贸易不断增加来应付这个局面。此外，我们必须鼓励自由世界一切工业化国家在一起进行新的合作，来帮助那些不那么幸运的国家摆脱贫穷的苦难。这样就能较好地分担这个负担，并且进行更多的有利的贸易。
    新国家以及正在努力处理建设问题的其他国家，只有对它们自己的命运表示信心，并且有实现自己的命运的意愿并把它们自己的人力物力用来实现它，这样才能得到进步。此外，国家变革方面的进步只能是逐步取得的——从牛车到喷气式飞机是没有容易的捷径的。但是，正如我们在开国初期依靠欧洲的援助一样，现在抱有这种信心和决心的那些新兴国家也应当得到帮助。
    在过去十五年中，有二十个国家获得了政治独立。每年都又有一些国家获得政治独立。其中大多数国家不幸缺乏技术能力和投资资本；如果没有自由世界在这些方面的支持，它们是不能有效地在自由中进步的。
    关于它们的需要，我们关心的主要焦点之一是南亚地区。在这里，单是在两个国家里，就有几乎五亿人民都在工作，辛勤地工作，以提高他们的水平，并且在这样做的时候，使他们自己成为阻挡一种会破坏自由的意识形态扩展的强大堡垒。
    我无法向你们表示我是多么深切地相信，为了我们自己和自由世界的利益，我们必须同他人合作，来帮助这些人实现他们在各种多年计划中表现出的正当的雄心。我们必须通过世界银行和其他机构，并且通过每个有能力帮助国家的单独行动，来坚决地面对这个巨大的挑战。
      当然，我们大家必须认识到，新兴的国家在自由中发展决不是仅仅获得外界财政援助的问题。在这个过程中的一个不可缺少的因素是，这些国家始终坚决行使为任何长期发展时期所必需的国家纪律。这种决心是特别重要的，因为改善的过程将必然是逐步的和辛苦的，而不是革命性的。此外，人人必须认识到，建设过程决不是一个短期的现象。连拥有最有利的条件的国家也得花上许多年。
    我要继续要求美国人民，为了他们自己的安全、繁荣与和平，务使这项巨大计划中的他们自己的那一部分得到充分的和愉快的支持。自由世界在这个问题上的决定可能带来不同的结果，可能使世界遭到灾难，也可能使世界在自由中得到进步。
    其它国家也有类似的需要，上月我访问了这些国家中的某些国家。
    为那些愿意在建设工作中提供帮助的国家建立一个共同的会议场所是适宜的。在过去一年中，我同几个西方国家的领导人讨论过这件事情。
    欧洲经济合作局由于经验丰富，可以帮助进行初期的研究，目标是利用工业化的自由世界的一切可以得到的经济力量——特别是私人投资资本。但是我再说一遍，这种帮助不管有多大，只有用于补充新兴国家人民的精神和意志的力量才能长久有效。
    我们希望通过给与这种帮助使这些国家有可能热情地聚集在自由的旗帜下。同一个阴郁的卫星国的体系的对照再没有比这更惊人的了。
    如果我们抓住这个机会建立不那么幸运的国家和在经济上已经有了高度发展的国家之间有成果的伙伴关系的时代，那么我们将使得建立一个以安全、自由与和平为基础的世界秩序的前景更加光明。否则，前景的确可能是黑暗的。我们可能正面临着历史的一个转折点，我们必须果断地行动。
    作为一个国家，我们只有从具有广泛基础的实力地位出发，才能成功地追求这些目标。
    不管我们多么热切地谋求有保证的和平，在谈判裁减军备问题的同时，我们必须保持高度的军事效能。在制订出具体的、可以相互实施的裁减军备措施以前，我们决不削弱保卫我们的制度的手段。
    美国拥有巨大的防御力量。我经过深思熟虑后相信，除非我们很愚蠢，忽视我们现在如此有力地支持的防御部队，否则任何国家都不会冒同我们打大战的危险。全世界都知道，今天要是有任何国家情不自禁地袭击美国，那末它本身将迅速遭受可怕的毁灭，虽然我国也可能遭受重大的损失。但是我再次向各国人民和一切国家保证，除了进行防御，美国永远不会使用这种毁灭性的力量。
    在过去一年里，由于“阿特拉斯”式洲际弹道导弹已经可以实际使用，我国的远距离打击力量得到了一支新的力量，今天我国的远距离打击力量在有人驾驶的轰炸机方面是无人匹敌的。在最近进行的十四次射程为五千多英里的试验发射中，“阿特拉斯”击中的地方离目标平均不到两英里。这比一条喷气式飞机的跑道还短——完全在全部毁灭的范围以内。这样的成就应当归功于美国的科学家和工程师们，在过去五年里，他们必须充分利用时间和技术来试制这些美国以前没有的远程弹道导弹。
    此外，今年将有越来越多的核发动的潜水艇参加我们的现役部队，其中有些潜水艇将装有“北极星式”导弹。这些在海洋上分布的出色的舰艇和武器能够准确地击中地球上几乎任何地方的目标。这些舰艇是不可能被突然攻击摧毁的，因此它们将成为我们最精锐的和平哨兵之一。
    为了对付并没有达到全面核战争的那种局势，我们继续保持我们的航空母舰部队、我们在国外的许多部队、我们的始终作好准备的陆军战略部队和海军陆战队师以及非军事人员。使这些部队经常保持现代化是一个花钱然而必要的过程，这个过程预定以可以不断加强我国实力的速度进行下去。
    这些部队中的一部分驻在我国以外的陆地上和海洋上，这令人信服地表明了我们决心同我们的盟国并肩保卫集体安全。此外，我已经指示采取步骤，在更长远的基础上安排我们给这些盟国的军事援助。这是为建立更健全的集体防御体系所必需的。
    其次我要谈到我们在空间探索方面所作的努力，这项工作往往被误认为是国防研究和发展工作的不可分割的一部分。
    首先，美国在过去两年间对世界在天体物体学和空间科学方面的丰富知识作出了伟大的贡献。目前关心这些发现的主要是科学界；但是，这些发现是更广泛地探索外层空间以期最后造福于全人类的重要基石。
    第二，我们正在顺利地执行的军事导弹计划并不因为我们目前缺乏在远距离空间探索方面非常需要的非常巨大的火箭引擎而受到损害。专家们向我保证，我们目前的导弹的推力是足够满足防御需要的。
    第三，美国正在努力发展巨型火箭引擎，以期把更重得多的运载工具送入空间进行探索。
    第四，同时必须记住，我们还只是开始在探索紧紧围绕着地球的空间。我们正在利用目前已经能够利用的发射系统发展人造卫星来侦察世界的气候，发展人造卫星转播站来促进和扩大全世界的通讯，以便帮助航行事业，向船只和飞机提供精确的方位，并使收集和播发我们所寻求的资料的工具臻于完善。在这而有着早日好好应用空间技术的最大希望。
    第五，我们的新的空间法实行以来刚刚有了一年的经验。我认为它在某些具体方面有些不足，有关改进的建议不久将提出。
    要完成我所提到的这许多任务，需要不断加强美国生活的精神、思想和经济方面的力量。我们的社会的坚定不移的目标是保证人人在上帝面前得到公正的待遇。我们必须始终保持警惕，不要使自由因为不留心地聚积起来的种种限制或缺乏大胆地处理当前的巨大问题的勇气而枯萎下去。
    一年以前，当我同你们会面的时候，我国正在从一次经济下降中摆脱出来，尽管重新获得繁荣的迹象当时对怀疑者不够有说服力。今天，我们的高涨的力量对每个人都是很明显的。1960年有希望成为我国历史上最繁荣的年代。
    但是，我们继续受到恼人的混乱现象的骚扰。
    在目前的问题中需要解决的有：
    ——需要在拖得很久的劳资僵局中保护公众的利益问题；
    ——始终不肯处理美国农业的一个部门中的一项极关重要的问题这样一种状况；
    ——持续的通货膨胀的威胁，以及始终存在的在财政上不负责任的倾向；
    ——在某些事例中，我们的某些公民得不到法律的平等保护。
    每个美国人都曾经对钢铁工业中的拖得很久的争端以及迟迟不能达成一项解决办法感到不安。
    我们大家都因在这个工业部门中终于达成了一项解决办法而感到安慰。在百分比方面，根据这项解决办法，钢铁公司在雇工费用方面的增加比自从第二次世界大战结束以来作出的以前任何一次解决办法中都要少。还可以令人满意地指出：尽管增加了工资和福利费，几个重要钢铁制造商宣布在现时钢铁的价格将不致增加。国家的利益要求：在这个得到这个新合同保证的工业和平时期中，劳资双方都作出一切可能的努力来增加钢铁制造方面的效率和生产率，以避免提高价格。
    这种情况的教训之一是：必须对付时间更长、规模更大的罢工这种对全国的潜在危险。为了保证不出现这种可能性，当然我们必须首先依靠负责的个人的理智。我打算鼓励劳资双方在谈判桌以外定期进行讨论，来不仅考虑同保持工业和平、价格稳定和经济发展同他们的共同利害关系，而且考虑这样做同公众的利害关系。
    在我看来，如果我们在我们自己的自由社会的一些重要部门中间不能建立自愿的、可靠的和持久的合作，要美国承认在各国之间建立合作的必要并认真地谋求这种合作，这几乎是荒诞的。
    如果不正视除了劳资方面之外的其他方面的基本问题，那就可能会使我们的社会的坚固的自由支柱受到严重的压力。
    我认为农业就是这些方面的一个方面。
    我们的基本的农业法律是在二十七年以前制订的，这是为了消除世界性的萧条所造成的困难而作出的一项应急的努力。在第二次世界大战期间，为了鼓励生产为维持受到严重战祸的自由世界所必要的粮食，继续保持了这些法律——同这些法律在经济上造成的不正常情况加剧了。
    今天，我们的农业问题完全不同了。今天的问题是作出有效的调整来适应由于科学上的革命而引起的变化。当原来的农业法律制订时，每小时的农业劳动所生产的小麦只及目前的四分之一。农业法律是完全过时的、无效的、耗费巨大的。
    若干年以来，我们一直保持一种过时的制度，这种制度不仅不能保护农业收入，而且还造成了日益增加的咄咄逼人的剩余物品。美国早就处于和平时期，但是我们却一直让我们的农场进行战时所需要的生产。
    我再次要求国会制定法律，使生产同市场更紧密地结合起来，使花费巨大的剩余产品比较容易处理，使农业经营有较大的自由，并且不断使农业纯收入得到增加。
    我们必须正视的另一个问题是量入为出的问题。这需要限制开支、对项目的轻重缓急不断进行重新估计、以及保持稳定的物价。
    我们必须防止通货膨胀。这是一个伪装得很厉害因而有时候很难认出来的敌手。但是我们显然需要制止物价继续全面上升——这种需要是我们大家都能看到和感觉到的。
    为了防止成本和价格不断上涨，需要每一个公民厉行自我节制。没有任何一个个人、城市、州或有组织的团体能够逃避抵抗通货膨胀的义务。因为每一个美国人都要为它付出沉重的代价。
    通货膨胀造成的破坏是没有止境的。我们在国外出售的商品的价格的增加，有把我们赶出曾经一度稳稳地属于我们的市场的危险。不管高昂得没有竞争力的国内价格究竟是由于要求获得过高的利润造成的，还是由于劳工费用的增加超过生产率的增加造成的，其最后结果对国家是有严重的损害的。
    我们必须同通货膨胀作战，就像对付一场危及我们的家屋的火灾一样。我们只有这样做才能防止它毁灭我们的薪金、储蓄、养老金和保险金，防止它腐蚀一个自由的、健康的经济和国家安全的基础。
    联邦政府能够用来对付通货膨胀和物价上涨的一个主要方法是保证它的支出低于它的收入。我们目前面对的债务大约为二千九百亿美元。在单单利息一项现在就要纳税人负担约九十五亿美元的情况下，显然必须制止这笔债务的增长。你们将高兴地听到：尽管最近的钢铁罢工产生令人不安的影响，我们估计我们的账目在今年6月30日将出现一笔接近于二亿美元的盈余。
    我将向国会提出1961年的平衡预算。防御方面的开支继续保持过去几年的和平时期的空前水平。除了一个例外以外，卫生、教育和福利方面的每一个重要类别的开支都将保持或超过去年的水平。在空间的开支方面，款项几乎增加一倍。这个预算的总的根据是国家的需要——而不是考虑具体的集团、地方或者政界人士的坚持态度。
    上述各项以外的开支的增加在很大程度上是由于已在以前实施的立法的费用有了增加。
    我重说一遍，这个预算将是一个平衡的预算。支出将是七百九十八亿美元。收入多于支出的数量（在预算中称为盈余）是四十二亿美元，这笔钱将用来偿还我们的国债。我个人认为，只要国家负有债务，任何一部分钱都不能恰当地称为“盈余”。我倒愿意把这笔钱看作
  “减少我们的孩子承继下来的抵押单。”一旦我们使这种支付成了正常的做法，我们就能够有利地改进我们的税收结构，从而真正减轻沉重的税收负担。
    无论如何，这样一种削减每年将为纳税者节省下大约二亿美元的利息。
    这个预算将有助于缓和对我们的信贷和资本市场的压力。它将加强全世界人民对我国经济和货币的力量的信心以及对我们个人和集体能够在财政上采取负责态度的信心。
    在管理数目庞大的公债方面，财政部不幸受到人为障碍的牵制。由于国会不愿取消一些过时的限制，财政部的处理这方面的困难问题的能力大大削弱了。今天更加迫切需要在债务管理方面有更大的自由，因为财政部不得不采取的一些不适当的财政措施的费用正在增加。在我的立法建议中，把扫除这一障碍的问题放在很重要的地位。
    另外还有一个有关民权的问题。
    在我们希望并计划实现一个更美好的世界的情况下，我们全都认识到必须对地方的和种族的偏见作斗争。从历史的长远的眼光来看，投票权一直是自由社会的最有力的支柱之一。尽管有宪法的保障，尽管最近若干年有了很大进步，但是，由于有偏见，我们国内的有些人仍旧不能得到法律的平等的保护。
    在你们上次会议的初期，我提出了能够有助于取消几项歧视美国人的基本权利的做法的立法。民权委员会又补充了一些建设性的建议。我希望这些建议将包括在这次会议将要认真考虑的问题以内。我相信，国会将从而向全世界表明，我们的政府正在为实现我国全体人民在法律前一律平等而努力。
    我们国家每年都在许多方面继续经历着深刻的变化和发展。
    在过去十八个月内，我们欢迎两个新州——阿拉斯加和夏威夷——加入了联邦。我们怀着自豪的心情向西边的这两颗星表示敬意。
    我们的有力的发展是多方面的，我们大家都欢迎这种发展，认为它是健康和活力的征象。例如，我们现在看到，大城市地区正在飞跃发展。
    到1975年，美国的大城市地区的面积将为今天的两倍。它们必须对付的城市问题的清单是惊人的。这些问题牵涉到用水供应、使空气保持清洁、调整地方税制、提供必要的教育、文化和社会服务机构和摧毁那些滋长过失和犯罪行为的条件。
    在应付这些问题的时候，如果我们珍视我国具有历史意义的自由，我们就必须保持在我国联邦制度的传统的范围内，这个制度把权力分给全国政府和州政府。由于这个制度是独一无二的，随便看一下的人可能会感到不能理解，但是它已经有效地实行了将近二百年。
    我毫不怀疑，我国城市问题和其它麻烦问题可以用美国传统的办法加以解决。我们在解决这些问题的时候必须了解，接受“得来容易”的联邦税款这种骗人的诱饵并不能真正解决任何问题，相反地却会引起破坏性的趋势。
    我国的教育制度提供了一个现成的例子。人人都认识到极其需要有现代化的学校设备，非常够格和得到适当报酬的教师，极其需要采用最好的教育法和课程。在教育我国青年方面，我们不能自满。
    但是，使人的思想受到更好的训练的途径并不在于联邦迅速给予短期或长期的财政援助。教育的过程主要是地方和个人的责任，政府的应急的、集中的行动不可能使这个过程取得很大进展。
    政府已经提出一项经过仔细推敲的计划来帮助消灭目前缺陷。这项计划的目的在于鼓励建筑教室，办法不是用联邦经费来代替州和地方的经费，而是采取刺激措施来扩大和鼓励州和地方的努力。这种做法排斥了由联邦政府支配或控制的观念。它是可行的，应当是符合每一个关心以美国的传统方式发展我国教育制度的美国人的心意的。我要求国会在这个问题上采取行动。
    我要重新提出我在去年1月份的国情咨文中对另一个问题提出过的建议。那时，我向国会说明我打算加紧我们的以国际的法治来代替武力的努力。根据在国外的许多次讨论，我深信，世界上其他国家人民和其他的国家普遍地、深切地抱有同样的目标。
    在这项咨文中，我曾指出我们的工作将包括重新审查我们自己同国际法院的关系。这个法院是联合国为了裁决国与国之间的国际法律争端而成立的。在1946年，我们承认了这个法院的裁判权，但是保留单方面地决定一个问题是否基本上属于国内权限范围之内的权利。现在参院里有一项提案主张取消我国目前的自行判断这一保留条件。我支持这项提案，并要求迅速通过这项提案。如果它得到通过，我打算要求联合国的各成员国对这个法院的裁判权给予类似的承认。
    在这里，在我任职的最后这一年，我来向国会议员们就我们各自代表的机构和我们两个部门的关系对今后的时日的意义讲几句话，这也许没有什么不妥当。
    我并不是唯一的同一个由反对党控制的国会一起进行工作的总统——只是没有任何其他总统工作的时间有我这样长罢了，但是，在个人关系和公务关系方面，我们都经历了过去五年的风暴。对这一点我是很感激的。
    在今后十二个月内，在我的继任者就职以前，我深切关怀我国国会和政府对我们自己以及其他国家的共同责任。我将根据今天我在这里所表示的信念采取行动，把我的全部精力用来完成现在的任务，不管这些任务需要进行访问以促进世界上更大的谅解，需要进行目的在于减少国际争端的谈判，还是需要就国内外问题经常同国会和美国人民进行讨论和联系。
    为了达到这些目的，我期望、而且将一心一意同国会保持紧密的建设性的联系。
    在立法和行政部门之间无关紧要的争吵上花掉的每一分钟，都意味着我们失去一分钟的宝贵时间来明智地制定和执行谋求我们国家的生存和进步的连贯的政策。
    我们谋求的是一个共同的目标——使我们自己的人民有更美好的机会，使人人享受正义的世界和平。
    在我们和我们的朋友面前有一种意识形态的挑战，四十多年以来，这种意识形态一直在国外宣扬它的目的，这就是最后胜过同它自己的政府不一致的一切形式的政府。
    我们知道，不管我们怎样反对帝国主义的共产主义的教义，它是一个由一些领袖们严酷地从事的一个巨大的企业，这些领袖迫使它的人民把行动和精神的自由以及他们个人希望在今后取得某种期望得到的好处的愿望都置于次要地位。
    共产党人可以摆出在过去十五年中取得的一系列的物质上的成就，而使他们对不结盟国家的人民作出的许多漂亮的诺言具有一种虚假的说服力。
    他们带来的竞争是十分厉害的。
    但是在我们的价值的天平中，我们把自由放在第一位——我们整个国家的存在和发展是同这一基本概念密切结合的，而这种存在和发展是我们接替自由世界的领导地位的原因。这是任何国家所能有的最宝贵的东西。这是共产党人永远不能提供的东西。美国在自由中所取得的物质成就的历史不仅写在我们自己的国家的史无前例的繁荣中，而且也写在我们为了重建遭到第二次世界大战的破坏的自由世界的经济而提供的数以十亿计的美元中，以及我们为了拯救受外部统治的威胁的其他许多国家的独立而花的数以十亿计的美元的有效的帮助中。毫无疑问，我们有能力来处理我们现在正在进入的世界历史的新时代的问题。
    但是，我们必须明智地、不倦地利用这种能力，而不管作出什么样的个人牺牲。
    使我们的政治星球陷于分裂的裂痕是既深且广的。
    而且，我们生活在一个语义混乱的海洋中，在这个海洋中，旧的名词不再忠实地传情达意了。
    警察国家被称为“人民民主国家”。
    武力征服自由人民被称为“解放”。
    这种欺诈的口号使得传达真正的信仰、事实和信念的问题变得更加困难。
    我们必须清楚说明我们的和平意图、我们的争取一个更美好的世界的愿望。在这样做的时候，我们必须使用语言来阐明思想，而不是把语言作为故意进行含沙射影的攻击和歪曲真理的工具。
    而且我们必须遵守我们说的话。
    在我最近到遥远的国家进行访问时，我发现一个又一个的政治家热切地对我说，他们的政府中有一些因素借自我们美国的宪法和我们的独立宣言中所确立的牢不可破的理想。
    作为一个国家，我们引以自豪的是：我们自己的宪法制度以及支持它的理想，长期以来一直被看成是自由的源泉。
    我们必须以我们的每一个行动来使我们自己当得起这种信任，要始终意识到：看起来似乎很微小的对自由的侵蚀逐渐积累起来就能够摧毁一个自由社会的整个结构。
    在抱有这样的信念的情况下，我们将担负起我们面前的任务。
    在抱有这样的献身精神和相信全能的上帝的情况下，人类总有一天会实现从远古以来人们一直热望着的自由中的团结。
                  德怀特·艾森豪威尔
