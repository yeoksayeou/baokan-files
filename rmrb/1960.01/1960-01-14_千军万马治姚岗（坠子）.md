The drums of the Great Leap Forward resound through the heavens!
A mighty force battles Yao Gang,
Heroes set a towering ambition,
Never to return home until Yao Gang is tamed.
This Yao Gang—

	Located in the Taiping Commune north of Zaoyang,
	The longest of the thirteen large ridges; this Yao Gang—
	The soil layer is less than three inches thick,
	Stiff clods and stones clatter all over the ground;
	High ground fears drought, low ground fears flooding,
	Neither high nor low ground fears weeds,
	Cotton planted yields no bolls,
	Peas planted don't sprout,
	Wheat planted struggles to head,
	Corn cobs grow like dragonfly heads,
	Long.
After liberation, although people's lives have improved,
The label of low yield still hangs overhead, alas!
Now the commune has great strength,
The Party calls for harnessing water, soil, and mountain ridges,
The Party committee leads the charge,
Rooting out Yao Gang is the battlefield.
We want fruit trees to blossom on the ridges,
We want cattle and sheep to graze on the ridges,
We want long flowing water on the ridges,

	Ten thousand acres of paddy fields shimmering with gold,
We want trees to grow into forests on the ridges,
	Turning the barren ridges into a mini-Suzhou and Hangzhou….
The secretary takes the lead,
Tractors and power machines roar,
A machine repair factory is set up on the slope,
The command post is established on the barren ridge;
The entire commune provides support from all directions,
Transporting materials back and forth busily.
Thousands of red flags flutter across the ridge,
Twenty thousand brave men and women are full of fighting spirit.
Silver hoes dance, shaking the mountain,
Carts hauling earth move urgently,
The iron rammers—lightly rise and heavily fall like raindrops,
The ramming song—praises the Communist Party in every verse,
On the ridge crest—a channel is opened to bring water from the Yao Peng Reservoir,
And six-four interconnected large dams are built to store water;
The key to the Dragon Palace is in our hands,
We fear neither severe drought nor flooding;
The thousand-year-old barren ridge has water,
The aged Yao Gang has become an eighteen-year-old young girl,
Please come and see again next year:
Green water fills the dams, fish fill the ponds;
Walk through the willow shade into the orchard,
Waves of fragrance assault the nostrils:
	Grape trellises stretch one after another,
	Each bunch is three feet long.
	Trucks arrive one after another,
	Loaded with grain, fruit, cotton, hemp, and pigs and sheep,

	Exchanging for countless machines:
	Generators, rice mills, water pumps, tractors…
	So convenient to use.
Yao Gang leaps onto a thousand-mile horse,
Progressing a thousand miles a day,
This is just a small episode in the governing of the ridge,
Socialist flowers bloom all over our Zaoyang.

    千军万马治姚岗（坠子）
    湖北枣阳曲艺队　集体创作大跃进的锣鼓震天响，千军万马战姚岗，英雄立下顶天志，治不好姚岗不还乡。这姚岗——
  就在枣阳以北太平公社，
  十三条大岗数它长；这姚岗——
  土层没有三寸厚，
  料僵石满地呼啦啦响；
  高地怕旱低怕淹，
  不高不低怕草荒，
  种下棉花不结桃，
  种下豌豆不长秧，
  种下小麦难吐穗，
  包谷棒长得像蜻蜓脑壳一样
    长。解放后，虽说人民生活有改善，低产的帽子还戴在头上，咳！如今公社力量大，党号召，治水、治土、治山岗，党委领导上战马，根治姚岗摆战场。要叫岗上结鲜果，要叫岗上跑牛羊，要叫岗上长流水，
    万顷稻田闪金光，要叫岗上树成林，
    荒岗变成小苏杭……。书记挂帅打头阵，拖拉机、动力机轰隆隆响，坡上办起机械厂，指挥部设在荒岗上；全公社四面八方齐支援，调运物资往来忙。千面红旗满岗飘，两万健儿斗志昂。银锄飞舞山摇动，车子运土走急忙，那铁硪——轻起重落似雨点，那硪歌——声声歌唱共产党，岗脊上——开渠引来姚棚水库
  的水，又修起——六十四口连环大堰把
  水来装；龙宫的钥匙掌在我们手，大旱大涝我们心不慌；千年枯岗有了水，年老的姚岗变成了十七八岁的大
  姑娘，明年请你再来看：绿水满堰鱼满塘；穿过柳荫把果园进，阵阵鲜花扑鼻香：
  葡萄一架连一架，
  一串足有三尺长。
  汽车一辆接一辆，
  满载着粮食、水果、棉麻和猪
      羊，
  换回的机器无其数：
  发电机、碾米机、抽水机、拖
    拉机……
  使用起来好便当。姚岗跨上千里马，一日千里好风光，这本是治岗的插曲一小段，社会主义花开遍了咱枣阳。
