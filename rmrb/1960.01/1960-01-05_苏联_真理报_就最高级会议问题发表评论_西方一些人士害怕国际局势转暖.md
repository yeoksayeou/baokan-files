The Soviet "Pravda" Publishes Commentary on the Summit Meeting Issue
Some Western Figures Fear the International Situation Will Warm Up

(Reported by this newspaper) The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on December 27th entitled "Good News" regarding the agreement to hold a summit meeting.

The editorial began by saying that on the eve of the New Year, good news spread throughout the world: an agreement was reached to hold a summit meeting in Paris next spring. The old year passed on to the new the positive results of efforts to strengthen peace and ensure peaceful coexistence. This is, of course, a good thing.

The editorial pointed out that the prospect of the Paris four-power conference in the spring, as well as the Western countries' acknowledgement that high-level meetings would still be needed in the future, pleases all peace-loving people. World opinion sees this as a realistic possibility for accelerating the resolution of mature problems. It is to accelerate the seeking of concrete solutions, and not to put on a show of seeking solutions in words while actually continuing the arms race step by step – this is what all good people expect. Public opinion makes this very clear, noting the hints that have already appeared in the Western press, as if it were possible to hold a kind of conference that does not practically solve problems but shelves them. The American "New York Herald Tribune" recently expressed this view. Commenting on the upcoming Paris conference, it suggested that this conference be seen as "only one link in a chain of continuous negotiations," and that "the purpose of suggesting a series of summit meetings" be seen as "to continue talks and negotiations...". This newspaper avoided mentioning concrete solutions.

The editorial pointed out that this attempt to shake the public's expectation that the upcoming talks will be effective in consolidating peace reflects the extremely contradictory situation that some Western figures are now in. They are afraid that a warming of the international situation will disrupt the West's military plans—the December meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization convincingly demonstrated that these plans are now being strengthened—but they cannot openly oppose the trend on issues such as summit meetings. Therefore, they hint at the possibility of talks that do not solve problems and negotiations that lead to no results, in order to justify their current political line. Of course, this method of covert "Cold War" cannot deceive everyone who demands a genuine easing of tensions.

### 苏联“真理报”就最高级会议问题发表评论  西方一些人士害怕国际局势转暖

    苏联“真理报”就最高级会议问题发表评论
    西方一些人士害怕国际局势转暖
    本报讯　苏联“真理报”12月27日就举行最高级会议问题达成协议发表了题为“好消息”的社论。
    社论开始说，在新年前夕，一个好消息传遍了全世界，就举行最高级会议问题达成了协议，会议将于明年春天在巴黎举行。旧的一年把加强和平和保障和平共处方面的努力的积极结果移交给了新的一年。这当然是件好事。
    社论指出，春季的巴黎四国会议的前景以及西方国家承认以后还需要举行高级会议的话使全体爱好和平的人感到高兴。世界舆论把这一点看成是加速解决已成熟问题的现实可能性。正是要加速求得具体的解决，而不是装出一副口头上谋求解决的样子而实际上还是按步就班地进一步进行军备竞赛，——这就是全体善良的人们所期望的。舆论十分清楚地说明这一点，注意到已经在西方报刊上出现的暗示，好像可以举行一种不实际解决问题而把这些问题束诸高阁的会议。最近美国的“纽约先驱论坛报”就表示了这种观点。它在评论即将举行的巴黎会议时，建议把这一会议看成“只是不断谈判的锁链中的环节之一”，并把“建议举行一些最高级会议的目的”看成是“为了继续谈话和谈判……”。这一报纸对具体的解决问题则避而不提。
    社论指出，这种想使舆论期望即将举行的会谈能对巩固和平有效的心情有所动摇的企图，反映了现在一些西方人士陷入的极端矛盾的处境。他们既害怕国际局势转暖会打破西方的军事计划，——北大西洋公约组织12月会议令人信服地证明，现在这种计划正在加强，——然而又不能公然反对最高级会议这样一些问题上的潮流。因此就暗示可能是不解决问题的谈话，没有结果的谈判，以便为自己的现在的政治方针辩护。当然，这种暗地“冷战”的方法欺骗不了一切要求真正缓和紧张局势的人。
