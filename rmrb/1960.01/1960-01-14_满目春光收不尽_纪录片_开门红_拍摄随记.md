An Endless Vista of Spring
—Notes on Filming the Documentary "Good Start"
Liu Caiyao

    In the first few days of the New Year, the capital's industrial front displayed a magnificent and vibrant scene, with good news pouring in everywhere, signaling a red-hot start.

    Such inspiring and joyous events are worth capturing extensively by us newsreel filmmakers. The comrades of the New Film Studio's "Good Start" film crew went to the front lines of the battle for a good start, and with immense excitement, filmed this documentary in just three days.

    Our first shot was filmed at midnight on New Year's Day 1960, in the converter workshop of the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's Experimental Plant. At that moment, the converter workshop was filled with the sounds of gongs and drums, and an atmosphere of joy. The Party committee leaders handed the "Full Red Competition" relay baton for 1960 to the foremen of the five steelmaking furnaces. At the sound of the order, the steel-winning battle of the five converters began simultaneously. We captured this starting scene with great intensity. The cameraman had just adjusted the camera, the comrade in charge of lighting had just set up the lights, and everyone hadn't even had time to catch their breath when bang, bang, bang! The No. 3 furnace rang the bell for tapping the steel. We rushed to the No. 3 furnace, and before we could choose a shooting angle, the huge converter began to tilt. In an instant, ten thousand rays of silver light flashed, and the first furnace of steel in 1960 was produced. As our camera was filming the dazzling sparks of steel, suddenly someone shouted, "No. 5 furnace is also about to tap steel, hurry and film it!" In fact, it wasn't just No. 5 furnace that was about to tap steel, but the other three furnaces were also about to tap steel. Fortunately, we had more than one camera, and we finally managed to capture the tapping of steel from all five furnaces.

    That day, we also went to the Chengzi Coal Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau. Here, there was another new scene. The electric drills and pneumatic picks in the mine echoed, and the large and small coal cars in the roadways crisscrossed, making the entire mine seethe with activity. On a small work surface, we encountered Li Jiude, a national model worker conference representative and a Communist Party member who had safely worked every day for ten years. At that time, he was holding an electric drill that normally required two people to operate, working with all his might. When we pointed the camera at him, Li Jiude repeatedly said modestly, "One person's strength is a single gun and horse, but the strength of everyone can move mountains and overturn seas." In the New Year, Li Jiude and his partners are determined to continue to improve the operation of drilling tools and promote ten technical innovations such as deep-hole blasting.

    We filmed some shots underground and came up to prepare to film the scene of reporting good news. As soon as we got out of the cage, the entrance to the mine was filled with the sound of gongs, drums, and applause. A group of miners' family members surrounded us, enthusiastically offering water and cigarettes to express their concern. This caught us off guard, as they mistook us for the miners who had achieved a good start.

    On January 2nd, we went to the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant. This day was the first working day of the plant in 1960. For almost the entire morning, our camera followed a congratulatory team organized by the trade union, beating gongs and drums from one machine tool to another.

    First, we went to the workbench of young worker Xie Lianqi. This young man had finished more than a day's worth of work in just three and a half hours today. When the comrades of the congratulatory team gave him a congratulatory plaque, they jokingly said, "You're number one now, but you might become number two in a little while." Sure enough, in less than half an hour, female worker Mao Shuhui overtook him. Before we finished filming Mao Shuhui's shot, the congratulatory team had already run to another machine tool. In this way, a situation of you chasing me also formed between us and the congratulatory team. A comrade from the workshop trade union said to me with a smile, "Hurry back and bring film in a car to shoot! I think you'll never finish filming this movie." Yes, this is indeed a movie that can never be finished!

    Whether we went to the large-scale electron tube factory or to the civil lighting factory that started from scratch in an ancient temple, whether we went to the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill or to the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, everywhere was bustling with activity, everywhere was carrying out technical innovations, and everywhere were people with red hearts and skillful hands. It was truly a case of reporting good news wherever there was production, and things turning red wherever they started. A vista of spring, a myriad of phenomena, let us keep marching on and advance victoriously! (Attached picture)

    满目春光收不尽
    ——纪录片“开门红”拍摄随记
    刘才瑶
    新年头几天，首都工业战线上便展现了万紫千红的大好景象，到处传捷报，开门一片红。
    这样震奋人心的大喜事，是值得我们新闻纪录电影工作者去大拍特拍的。我们新影厂“开门红”摄制组的同志，分头去到了大战开门红的前线，怀着无比激动的心情，在三天的时间内，拍摄了这部影片。
    我们的第一个镜头，是在1960年元旦零时，在北京石景山钢铁公司试验厂转炉车间开拍的。这时，转炉车间锣鼓喧天、喜气洋洋。党委领导人将1960年满堂红竞赛接力棒授给了五个炼钢炉的炉长，一声令下，起跑开始，五个转炉的夺钢战斗同时打响了。我们紧张地拍下了这个起跑的场面，摄影师刚刚整理了一下机器，负责照明的同志刚刚布置好灯光，大家还来不及喘一口气，当当当！三号炉便响起了出钢的钟声，我们赶紧到三号炉前，不等选择摄影角度，巨大的转炉便开始倾斜了，转瞬间，万道银光闪起，1960年的第一炉钢炼出来了。我们的镜头正在对着耀眼的钢花拍摄，突然，不知道是谁大喊起来：“五号炉也快出钢了，快去拍呵！”其实，何止五号炉就要出钢了，其它的三个炉，也都快要出钢了。幸好我们来的摄影机不止一个，终于把五个炉的出钢全都抢拍下来了。
    这一天，我们还去到了京西矿务局的城子煤矿，这里又是一番新气象，井下的电钻风镐交响，巷道的大小煤车相错，使整个矿井沸腾起来了。我们在一个不大的工作面上，遇到了全国群英会代表、十年如一日安全出勤的共产党员李九德，这时，他一人抱着平时要两人操纵的电钻，浑身是劲地在工作，当我们把摄影机对着他的时候，李九德一再谦虚地说：“一个人的力量是单枪匹马，大伙的力量才能移山倒海。”在新的一年，李九德和他的伙伴决心要实现继续改进钻眼工具操作，推广深孔爆破等十项技术革新。
    我们拍了一部分井下的镜头，上井来准备拍报喜的场面，一下罐笼，井口便响起了一片锣鼓声和掌声，一群矿工家属围上前来送水递烟，十分热烈地慰问我们，这使得我们一时不知所措，他们误把我们当做取得开门红的矿工了。
    1月2日，我们去到了北京第一机床厂，这一天，是这个厂1960年的第一个工作日。几乎整个上午，我们摄影机一直随着一支由工会组织的贺喜队，敲锣打鼓地从这台机床转到另一台机床。
    最先，我们去到的是青工谢连启的工作台前。这个小伙子今天只用了三个半小时便干完了一天多的活。贺喜队的同志给他送喜报牌的时候，开玩笑地说：“你现在是老大，说不定呆一会儿就要变成老二了。”果然，不到半个小时，女工毛淑惠便赶在他的前面去了。我们还没有拍完毛淑惠的镜头，贺喜队早就跑到另外一台机床边去了。这样，我们和贺喜队之间，也形成了一个你追我赶的局面。车间工会的一个同志笑着对我说：“快回去用汽车拉胶片来拍吧！我看你这个电影，一辈子都拍不完。”是的，这的确是一部拍不完的电影！
    不论我们去到规模很大的电子管厂，还是去到白手起家办在古庙里的民用灯具厂，不论我们是去到京棉一厂，还是去到长辛店机车车辆厂，到处是热气腾腾，到处在大搞技术革新，到处是心红手巧的人，真是哪里生产那里报喜，哪里开门那里就红。春光满目，气象万千，让我们马不停蹄，乘胜前进！（附图片）
