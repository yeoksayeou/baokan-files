    Self-Reliance
    Zhao Ji
    In the great transformation of agricultural technological reform, we not only need to manufacture a large number of agricultural machines and chemical fertilizers, and build more hydropower stations... more importantly, we also need people who can operate the machines and master the technology. Therefore, the task of cultivating a large number of agricultural technical personnel is now before us.
    How should we cultivate them? One way is for the state to run technical schools, using regular methods to train them step by step. However, the need for talent is so urgent. The country needs agricultural technical personnel in the millions. Relying solely on the state to train them in schools will be difficult to meet the needs in a short period of time. What should we do? The news from the agricultural machinery departments of Shaanxi Province and the Xujiazhuang People's Commune in Hengshui County, Hebei Province, published in this newspaper today, provides another good way, which is self-reliance. We cannot just look upwards, waiting for superiors to send people. We must use our own hands and think of solutions.
    Cultivating agricultural technical personnel through self-reliance is not only possible, but also can be done with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In just over a year, the agricultural machinery departments of Shaanxi Province have trained more than 13,000 technical personnel, accounting for more than 95% of the province's agricultural machinery technicians. In the second half of 1959, the Xujiazhuang People's Commune trained more than 80 tractor drivers, 22 truck drivers, and 300 irrigation and drainage machinery operators. These technical personnel have played a timely role in their work, and have saved a lot of expenses compared to training in schools. We should undertake such greater, faster, better, and more economical things on a large scale.
    In the process of cultivating technical personnel, we will of course encounter some difficulties. The question is whether we have the courage to overcome difficulties. We must advance in the face of difficulties and stubbornly overcome them, not retreat in the face of difficulties and shrink back. Moreover, difficulties are only one aspect of the problem; we must also see the other aspect, which is also the main aspect—favorable conditions. If we carefully analyze various situations and find favorable conditions, we will naturally increase our courage to overcome difficulties. The current excellent situation in the country's rural areas has brought many favorable conditions for cultivating agricultural technical personnel. For example, the People's Communes are large in size and have a high degree of public ownership, and have the strength to run short-term training classes and establish technical teaching stations or guidance stations. Unified allocation of labor allows us to transfer a portion of personnel to study technology. There are already a few technical personnel and some new agricultural machinery in the communes, which can be used to teach and learn and use as a master leads an apprentice, and train in practical work. The relationship between urban and rural areas is becoming increasingly close, and it is also possible to link up with factories and schools to solve the problem of teachers. A large number of young and middle-aged people in rural areas have removed the label of illiteracy and have a certain level of education, opening the door to learning technology. In particular, under the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the broad masses of peasants are in high spirits and full of energy. Their urgent demand to learn technology will be a huge force to break through all difficulties. See clearly these favorable conditions, use these favorable conditions, present difficulties, follow the mass line, consult with the masses, and give full play to the strength and wisdom of the masses. Difficulties can be solved.
    We have the leadership of the Party, the support of the masses, and a certain material basis. As long as we give full play to our subjective initiative, we have sufficient conditions to cultivate a large number of primary agricultural technical personnel in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way.

    自力更生
    赵基
    在农业技术改造这个伟大变革的过程中，我们不但需要制造大量的农业机械、化学肥料，建设更多的水电站……更重要的，还要有开动机器掌握技术的人。因此，大量培养农业技术人材的任务摆在眼前了。
    怎样培养呢？国家办技术学校，用正规方法按部就班地培养，这是办法之一。但是人材的需要是这样紧迫，全国需要的农业技术人材以百万计，单靠国家在学校中培养，在短时期内难以满足需要。怎么办？今天本报发表的陕西省农业机械部门和河北省衡水县徐家庄公社的新闻，提供了另一个好办法，这就是自力更生。眼睛不能只向上看，等待上级派人来，自己要动手想办法。
    自力更生培养农业技术人材不但办得到，而且可以多快好省。陕西省农业机械部门在一年多时间里，就培养了一万三千多名技术人材，占全省农业机械技术人员的95％以上。徐家庄人民公社在1959年下半年中，就培养了八十多名拖拉机手，二十二名汽车司机，三百名排灌机械手。这些技术人员及时地在工作中发挥了作用，比较在学校中培养节约了大量的经费。像这样多快好省的事应当大办特办。
    在培养技术人材的过程中，当然会碰到一些困难。问题在于有没有克服困难的勇气，要知难而进，顽强地战胜困难，不是知难而退，畏缩不前。何况有困难也只是问题的一方面；还必须看到另一方面，也是主要的一方面——有利条件。如果详细地分析了各种情况，找出有利条件，就自然会增加克服困难的勇气。当前全国农村的大好形势，给培养农业技术人材带来许多有利条件。例如，人民公社一大二公，有力量举办短期训练班和建立技术传授站或辅导站；劳动力统一调配，可以抽调一部分人员学习技术；公社里已经有了少数技术人材和一部分新式农业机械，这就可以用师傅带徒弟的办法边教边学边用，在实际工作中培养；城乡关系日益紧密，还可以和工厂、学校挂钩解决师资问题。农村中大批青壮年摘掉了文盲帽子，有了一定的文化程度，为学习技术打开了大门；特别是广大农民在八届八中全会精神的鼓舞下，意气风发，干劲冲天，他们学习技术的迫切要求将是冲破一切困难的巨大力量。看清这些有利条件，利用这些有利条件，有困难，摆出来，走群众路线，同群众商量，充分发挥群众的力量和智慧，困难是可以解决的。
    我们有党的领导，有群众的支持，又有一定的物质基础，只要充分发挥主观能动性，有充分条件可以又多又快又好又省地培养出大量初级农业技术人材来。
