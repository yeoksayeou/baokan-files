This newspaper reports: The 700,000 Hui and Han people in the mountainous Guyuan Special Zone in the southern part of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are currently engaged in a water control and mountain harnessing movement with the heroic spirit of conquering nature, rapidly changing the face of this region, which was once known for its harsh mountains and rivers.

Since the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement in 1958, guided by the principles of comprehensive planning and integrated management, this mountainous area has achieved tremendous success in water conservancy and mountain harnessing. The eleven large and medium-sized mountain reservoirs built on the three river systems of the Qingshui River, Hulu River, and Jing River have been fully completed. Half of the twelve irrigation canals, totaling more than 450 kilometers in length, connected to the reservoirs have been completed. Since these reservoirs were successively completed in the summer of 1959, they have begun to block floods and irrigate farmland, and a comprehensive utilization mountain reservoir irrigation network is gradually taking shape throughout the special zone. These reservoir projects, along with other various soil and water conservation measures, have basically controlled the drainage area of 14,200 square kilometers of various river systems, accounting for 77% of the total drainage area of the special zone. The large amount of sediment carried by these rivers into the Yellow River every year has been basically controlled. Currently, the mountain harnessing and water control movement in this area is continuing to leap forward, with 60,000 to 70,000 laborers投入 this battle. The soil and water conservation projects in the whole region to control more than 1,000 square kilometers of barren mountains and barren gullies this year have been fully started. The construction of dozens of mountain canal projects with a total length of more than 200 kilometers is also accelerating. Three of the five new reservoirs planned to be built are under construction. Thousands of laborers at the reservoir construction sites are working day and night to speed up the project progress and strive to block floods and store water this summer.

The Guyuan Special Zone has more mountains and less flatland, and most areas are arid mountainous regions. The annual rainfall is only 250 mm to 300 mm, and it is mostly concentrated in July and August. In the past, droughts of varying degrees occurred here almost every year, and the yields of various crops were very unstable. Therefore, developing reservoir irrigation and thoroughly harnessing the mountains has become the main way to build mountainous areas and change the arid landscape. In leading the masses to carry out water conservancy construction and mountain harnessing, the Guyuan Local Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the battle slogans of taking water conservancy construction as the key, focusing on water storage; treating the three rivers (Qingshui River, Hulu River, Jing River) simultaneously, grasping the three waters (sky water, surface water, groundwater) simultaneously, and "storing water like storing grain, with each person storing 300 cubic meters of water," vigorously launched a mass movement combining water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation, and accelerated the change of the mountainous landscape.

In such an arid mountainous area, large-scale water conservancy projects and the management of barren mountains is an extremely arduous struggle to transform nature. The flood control dams of the reservoirs that have been built are generally 40 to 50 meters high, and the water diversion tunnels and spillways of some reservoirs are all excavated from stone mountains. The Lao Longtan Canal, which diverts water up the mountain in the famous Liupan Mountain, is one of the most difficult projects in diverting water up the mountain. Both sides of Lao Longtan are cliffs more than 90 meters high, with a pool of water several meters deep in the middle, with white waves rolling, which is shocking. However, the heroic Hui and Han people made the vow that "if the water does not leave Longtan, people will not leave the stone mountain," tied ropes around their waists and hung on trees, opened up small paths along the cliffs, quickly drilled water diversion tunnels on the mountainside, leveled the "Tiger's Mouth," split open the "Dragon King's Weir," and opened up the more than 400-meter-long "Green Cliff," and finally built a water diversion canal that can irrigate more than 40,000 mu of land. Building reservoirs in the arid loess plateau gully area has many special difficulties. In winter, the cold weather brings serious difficulties to construction. However, the Hui and Han people issued the bold statement that "We are not afraid of high mountains and long distances, difficulties cannot stop heroes, we will step over high mountains and cross the sky, and we will work hard even when the wind is blowing and it is snowing," and carried out labor competitions, still maintaining the same labor efficiency as usual. In the spring, as the weather warms up, the ice river thaws, but the melting ice water adds trouble to the construction of the main dam; in the summer and autumn seasons, flash floods may cause the dam to collapse. In this case, the strategy they adopted was: think of the worst possibility, strive for the best; attack and defend. To attack means to do our best to race against time and floods, race against seconds, and storm the main dam; to defend means to increase flood control equipment to ensure the safety of the main dam. It was under the guidance of this idea that various water conservancy projects were carried out quickly, well, and economically. Many reservoirs that can store tens of millions of cubic meters to hundreds of millions of cubic meters of water were completed in just a few months or a year. The Shixiakou Reservoir in Haiyuan County stores nearly 100 million cubic meters of water. The original plan was to invest more than 10 million yuan and take three or four years to complete. The masses designed and constructed at the same time in the struggle against floods, simplified facilities as much as possible, used local materials, invested only more than 900,000 yuan, and completed it in one year and four months. This reservoir has experienced the test of nineteen major floods that have not been encountered in ten years last year, and the flood control dam is still as stable as Mount Tai. In the struggle to change the arid landscape, the Hui and Han people relied on the power of the people's communes and further promoted the close unity of the communist style. The mountains and the plains, the upstream and the downstream, the benefiting areas and the non-benefiting areas, were all united as one, twisted into one rope, and supported each other to overcome difficulties.

While concentrating on building large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, the entire special zone also fully utilized the superior conditions of the people's communes in accordance with the principles of comprehensive management and comprehensive development, mobilized more labor, organized year-round mountain management infrastructure teams of tens of thousands of people and assault teams of 50,000 to 60,000 people, combined year-round management with seasonal assault management, planted trees and grass on barren mountains, built terraced fields on mountain slopes, built river terraces in gullies, managed dry mountains and barren ridges, and promoted the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. At present, all eleven reservoirs that have been built have been stocked with fish. Larger reservoirs have also established power stations. In the past two years or so, a total of more than 2.28 million mu of forests have been planted on the barren mountains and bare ridges. Many "poor mountain villages" that were once very arid and called "one year of drought, two years of famine, and three bare eggs when it rains heavily" (bare soil, bare fertilizer, bare seeds) are now presenting a new scene of abundant harvests, thriving livestock, water conservancy of cultivated land, terraced slopes, and afforestation of barren mountains and gullies.

    制服穷山恶水　创造幸福美景
    固原七十万回汉人民治水治山
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区南部山区固原专区的七十万回汉人民，目前，正以气吞山河的英雄气概，开展着治水、治山运动，使一向被人们称为穷山恶水的山区，如今迅速地改变着它的面貌。
    这个山区从1958年大跃进和人民公社化以后，在全面规划、综合治理的方针指导下，兴修水利和治山运动取得了巨大成就。在清水河、葫芦河、泾河三个水系兴修的十一座大、中型山地蓄水库，已经全面竣工。同水库相连的总长四百五十多公里的十二条灌溉干渠，有一半已经完工。这些水库从1959年夏季陆续竣工以来，就开始拦蓄洪水，灌溉农田，一个综合利用的山区蓄水灌溉网正在全专区逐步形成。兴修的这些蓄水工程，加上其他各种水土保持措施，已经基本上控制了各个河系的流域面积一万四千二百多平方公里，占全专区总流域面积的77％。这些河流每年大量输入黄河的泥沙，已基本上得到控制。目前这个地区的治山治水运动正在持续跃进，投入这一战斗的民工已有六、七万人。全区今年内治理荒山、荒沟一千多平方公里的水土保持工程，已经全面动工。兴修二百多公里的数十条山地渠道工程，也正在加速施工。计划继续新修的五座水库，已有三座动工兴建。水库工地上的数千民工正在日夜奋战，加快工程进度，争取在今年夏季拦洪蓄水。
    固原专区境内山多川少，大部分地区都是干旱山区。每年降雨量只有二百五十毫米到三百毫米，而且多集中在7、8月间，这里几乎过去每年都发生程度不同的旱灾，各种作物产量很不稳定。因此，发展蓄水灌溉，彻底治山，就成为建设山区、改变干旱面貌的主要途径。中共固原地方委员会在领导群众开展兴修水利和治山运动中，提出以兴修水利为纲，以蓄水为主；三河齐治（清水河、葫芦河、泾河），三水齐抓（天上水、地面水、地下水），和“蓄水如蓄粮，每人蓄水三百方”的战斗口号，大力开展了以兴修水利和水土保持相结合的群众运动，加速改变山区面貌。
    在这样干旱的山区，大规模地兴修水利工程和治理荒山，是一项非常艰巨的改造自然的斗争。所修的水库，拦洪大坝一般都有四、五十米高，有些水库的输水洞、溢洪道都是从石山中开凿的。著名的六盘山的引水上山渠道老龙潭渠，是引水上山工程中的艰巨工程之一。老龙潭两岸是九十多丈高的悬崖绝壁，中间是数丈深的潭水，白浪滚滚，触目惊心。但是，英雄的回汉人民立下了“水不出龙潭，人不下石山”的誓言，腰系绳索吊在树上，沿着绝壁开劈人行小道，迅速地在半山腰凿通了输水洞，削平了“老虎嘴”，劈开了“龙王砭”，打通了四百多米长的“青石崖”，终于修成了可以灌溉四万多亩地的引水上山渠道。在干旱的黄土高原沟壑区兴建水库有着不少的特殊的困难。冬季，天寒地冻给施工带来严重困难。但是回汉人民发出“不怕高山远，困难挡不住英雄汉，踏过高山翻过天，刮风下雪也要干”的豪语，开展劳动竞赛，仍然保持着同往常一样的劳动工效。春天随着天气的转暖，冰河解冻了，消冰水却给主坝的施工增添了麻烦；夏、秋季节山洪暴发会有溃坝决口的危险。在这种情况下，他们采取的战略是：往最坏处着想，向最好处努力；要攻，又要守。攻，就是尽最大的努力，同时间和洪水赛跑，分秒必争，突击主坝；守，就是要增加防洪设备，确保主坝安全。就在这种思想指导下，使各种水利工程进行得又快又好又省。许多可以蓄水几千万立方米到上亿立方米的水库，只在几个月或一年多的时间里就完成了。海原县石峡口水库蓄水近一亿方，原计划投资一千多万元，需要三、四年才能建成。群众在与洪水作斗争中，一边设计，一边施工，因陋就简，就地取材，只投资九十多万元，用一年零四个月的时间就建成了。这座水库在去年经历了十九次十年不遇的大洪水的考验，拦洪大坝仍然稳如泰山。在改变干旱面貌的斗争中，回汉人民依靠人民公社的威力和进一步发扬亲密团结的共产主义风格，山上和山下，上游和下游，受益地区和非受益地区，都团结成了一条心，拧成了一股劲，互相支援战胜困难。
    全专区在集中力量修建大中型水利工程的同时，还根据综合治理、全面发展的方针，充分利用人民公社的优越条件，发动更多的劳动力，组织了上万人的常年治山基建队和五、六万人的突击队伍，把常年治理与季节性的突击治理结合起来，在荒山上大量植树种草，山坡上修梯田，沟壑中兴修川台阶地，治理干山枯岭，促进农林牧副渔全面发展。目前已经兴修的十一座水库都放养了鱼。比较大的水库还建立了发电站。过去的荒山秃岭，两年多来共营造林二百二十八万多亩，很多原来十分干旱、被称为“一年遇旱两年歉，暴雨来了三光蛋”（土光、肥光、种子光）的“穷山村”，现在已呈现出耕地水利化，坡地梯田化和荒山荒沟绿化的五谷丰登、六畜兴旺的新景象。（附图片）
