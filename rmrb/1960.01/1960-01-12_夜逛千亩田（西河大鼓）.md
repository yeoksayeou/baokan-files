Public Commune Celebrations

　　Night Visit to the Thousand-Mu Field (Xihe Dagu)
　　Sun Laikui

　　The People's Commune is filled with cheers, a great leap forward to a higher realm, holding high the red flag of the General Line, advancing victoriously, and bravely attacking nature. Thousands of troops and horses overturn mountains and seas, and the Dongfeng Commune has created another thousand-mu wheat high-yield field. Comrades, working in the fields, talking and laughing, it's really like marrying a wife and celebrating the New Year, an infertile man adding a son in his old age, so happy they can't sleep!

　　This day, after dinner, the girl Xiulan went to find the captain, Wang Danian. Tonight, the wheat field needs watering, and the two of them are going to inspect the furrows. As soon as she entered the courtyard, she heard the father and son arguing in the house. The young girl, not understanding the situation, couldn't persuade them, so she had to stand outside the door first.

　　She heard the old man say, "You brat make me angry all day, what good will you get if you anger me to death!" Danian said, "You get angry as soon as I say you're backward, what reasons do you have to talk about?" The old man said, "During the land reform, I was one of the first to fight the landlords. When the cooperative movement started, I was the first to sign up. When the People's Commune was established, I was the first to invest money. Since the Great Leap Forward, I've been even more energetic, and I've also participated in the large-scale construction of the thousand-mu field. On what basis do you say I'm backward? If you can't explain the reason, we're not done!"

　　Danian said, "Yes! You were very progressive in the past, but now you've fallen behind. The thousand-mu field is so well managed, but you only worked for three days from the beginning. After three days, you not only didn't go, but you get annoyed when asked to take a look?" The old man said, "I didn't go later because I was sick. If I wasn't sick, I would have worked harder than you, boy!" Danian said, "Since you're sick, why did you stop the doctor from coming?" The old man said, "I was afraid of spending money on treatment." Danian said, "Dad, you don't need to cover up cleverly, I've known your illness for a long time. It's because there are a few graves in the thousand-mu field that are too much in the way, and the commune members all volunteered to move them out, but you wouldn't move them. Not only wouldn't you move them, but you also stood in the field talking about feng shui, annoying the adults and children who surrounded you. They pointed and called you an old superstitious fool, which made you run home and never go to the thousand-mu field again."

　　The old man glared when he heard this: "You brat, don't try to confuse me with this! I'm nothing when it comes to feng shui, you've only understood human affairs for a few days! If it weren't for the good feng shui of the old graves, it would be very difficult for you to become this captain." Danian said, "Since our feng shui is so good, why were our ancestors so poor? Since the Communist Party came, we were able to share houses and land and have food and clothing. Since ancient times, emperors have deceived the people with feng shui, but they couldn't stop the dynastic changes and the loss of their empires. Before liberation, the landlords boasted that their feng shui was good, but they couldn't stop the people's revolution from overthrowing them! In the old society, people believed in fate and talked about feng shui, all of which were deceptive tricks. Dad, you better stop believing in this, we might as well move the graves as soon as possible."

　　Wang Danian was sincerely trying to persuade his father, but who knew that the old man would be even more angry, his hair standing on end: "You brat, don't lecture me with this useless stuff, I won't move them no matter what you say! I'm not afraid of being called backward, I'll still be buried here when I die." The more he talked, the angrier he got, banging on the table.

　　Zhang Xiulan realized that things were not good and quickly entered the room to interject, saying, "Uncle, what's the matter that's worth getting so angry about? You should forgive your own son if he says something wrong. Calm down and go to sleep." As she spoke, she filled the old man with a bag of tobacco. "Brother Danian, let's go quickly if there's nothing else, and talk about our work." She pulled Danian out of the house, and the old man slammed the door shut, flopped down on the bed with a thud, and grumbled impatiently: "This kid has never made me angry about anything, but he's constantly making me angry about this grave. No matter what you do, it's hard for a son to control his father!" He was so angry that he couldn't lie still or sit up straight, and kept smoking one bag of tobacco after another.

　　Suddenly, he thought, everyone says the thousand-mu field is good, shouldn't I go and take a look? No! These days, as soon as I go out the door, people point and talk about me. If I go now and someone says something nasty to me, wouldn't I be in a dilemma! Then he thought, oh well! They can say what they want, and I can retort. Am I supposed to be afraid to show my face because of this? He finally got up and left the bed, came to the door, looked and saw that the moon was bright and the stars filled the sky. He staggered forward, leaving the village and heading south.

　　He came to the field and looked, wow! The whole place had been completely transformed! Dong dong dong, the sound of the locomotive boiler was like a war drum, and the sound of water in the furrows was like a flowing spring. The light shone brightly, the lights across the way were like daylight, and a bright avenue was in front of him. The long-gone Wolong Ridge was nowhere to be seen, nor was the ancient Old Dragon Pool. Across the way, there was a colorful archway, tall and large, with a big electric light on top. The horizontal inscription, written in bold cursive script, read: Thousand-Mu Wheat High-Yield Field!
White: This old man came to the color gate below looked up, could not help but be surprised, ah! This is a thousand mu wheat high-yield field! But only see:

　　The thousand-mu high-yield field is truly extraordinary. The Leap Forward Gate is three zhang tall, painted red and particularly majestic. A large electric light is installed on top, the light shining brightly like daytime. The couplets are written in red letters, with strong will and soaring enthusiasm. The upper couplet reads: "Go all out to strive for first place"; the lower couplet reads: "High-yield miracles spread throughout the world."

Looking inside the Leap Forward Gate, it is even more like a paradise. In the middle is a large road, and on both sides are wheat fields. Praising the wheat fields, extolling the wheat fields, the wheat fields are truly extraordinary. The ridges are standardized, and the dimensions must be precise. Three zhang long, one zhang wide, like the earth covered in square bricks. The furrows are in a straight line, and the ridges are like a chessboard. The wheat ridges are like ink lines, and the wheat seedlings are like green felt. There are a few key words inside: even, straight, clean, strong, wet, and soft. To say even: the ground is even, the bottom of the ridges is even, the furrows are even, the fields are even, everywhere is as even as a mirror. To say straight: the furrows are straight, the wheat ridges are straight, the backs of the ridges are straight, the sections of the ridges are straight, the sides of the roads are straight, the sides of the fields are straight, as straight as a pen without any bends. To say hard, the ditches are packed hard. To say soft, the deep-plowed soil is soft. To say strong, fertilizer is applied in layers to make it strong. To say wet, machine irrigation keeps it perpetually moist. To say clean, the land inside and out is clean everywhere, not even a chicken feather is allowed to remain.

　　Due north, a piece of land, heaven upon heaven. A large patch of lightbulbs are hung, no more than a foot and three inches from the ground. During the day, the sun shines, and at night, they also bake with electricity. It's not to make things special, but to boldly experiment, experiment this year and welcome next year. Slogans and slogans on the wooden sign: Soaring aspirations reach the sky. It reads: Heroes compete in the wheat field, resolutely reversing the universe. Aim to be the champion in the province, aim to be the top scorer in the country, resolutely manage this high-yield field well!

　　The old man secretly praised after seeing this, oh! What a wonderful thousand-mu wheat high-yield field, the old man was more and more delighted to see it!

　　"Such a garden-like wheat field, I have truly seen for the first time, it really lives up to its name! The land has become like this since the commune started. If we work hard for another year or two, install power stations everywhere, use machines completely for work, turn every ditch into a paddy field, have a large amount of fertilizer and pesticides, and pile up grain harvests like mountains, then a happy life will be even sweeter! Tomorrow, I will definitely talk to the commune and ask to work in this field for a few years!"

　　The old man was more and more happy to see it, walking this way and strolling that way. He kept reaching out to pull at the wheat ridges, and tasting the soil to see if it was salty or sweet. As he walked, he suddenly paused, his feet stood still: "Huh! Why is this place so unsightly? The water furrows are crooked and winding! Weeds and thorns everywhere, right in the middle of the wheat field. Hmm! If you want it to be good, you should make it all good, why leave this place to be offensive!"

　　Muttering in his heart, he looked closely and saw that it was his own family's graves right in front of him. The old man shivered as soon as he understood, and his heart felt like it was being cut with a knife. No wonder my son is getting angry with me about it, it seems that it's not unfair to say that I'm stubborn. If everyone handled things like me, how could we manage this thousand-mu high-yield field well? Tomorrow I will definitely talk to my son, and the two of us will move the graves as soon as possible.

　　The old man was regretting it in his heart when he suddenly saw two young people coming from across the way. He was afraid of running into them and having his shortcomings exposed again, so he quickly hid behind the grave mound. He secretly watched carefully, and it was his own son, Wang Danian, who was coming. The girl Xiulan also came, and each of them was carrying a big iron shovel. The old man was furious when he saw this: Good boy! He must be secretly coming to move the graves! He even found a female helper for this, and plans to finish moving them all tonight. Moving the graves is up to me, I can't be afraid of my son, afraid of you Danian! If you do this, I will knowingly do wrong, as the saying goes: A gentleman would rather break than bend!

　　The old man was really angry, but who knew that the two of them would throw down the shovels as soon as they arrived. They looked around, and there was nowhere to sit, how could it be so coincidental that they sat right in front of the old man. As soon as they sat down, Danian took Xiulan's hand, and Xiulan leaned close to Danian's shoulder. The old man understood as soon as he saw it, so they came here secretly to talk about love. Good boy, can't you talk about love there? Why did you have to sit in front of me! It's not right for me to listen and watch, but if I don't watch, they'll squeeze me here and I can't move. Oh well! I can't move anyway, you can talk about love however you want!

　　Danian said, "We've been working really fast tonight, and in no time, we've inspected all the furrows." The girl said, "Not only are the two of us working hard, but the commune members are also leaping forward, and they're all working especially happily!" Danian said, "Hey! People can all see that the two of us are good together. They're gossiping about us behind our backs!" The girl said, "Hey! Our relationship is based on labor, it's a correct love, let them gossip as they please! We're just waiting for the wheat harvest to be the betrothal gift, and then we'll register our marriage and move in together!"

　　Danian said, "It's all good for the two of us to get married, but the elders in our two families are worlds apart! Your dad is so progressive, he became a party member again in his sixties. The leaders are taking care of him because he's old, and they don't let him work, which makes him so anxious that he shaves off his beard and pretends to be young. My dad is too backward, he's stubbornly refusing to move this grave! He glares at me as soon as I try to persuade him, who knows how stubborn he is? When will it end!"

　　The girl said, "Brother Danian, you can't get impatient about this, you have to persuade the old man patiently. Old people are bound to be unaccustomed to new things sometimes, who asked him to live in the old society for so many years. If it doesn't work today, persuade him again tomorrow, if it doesn't work tomorrow, there's always the day after tomorrow. As long as you talk to the old man patiently, he will move the grave sooner or later. I know this old man's temper, he's never fallen behind in anything. Don't think there's still this grave today, he might let us move it tomorrow."

　　The old man was more and more happy to hear it: What a clever Zhang Xiulan! What she says is so sensible, it makes me like her from the bottom of my heart. If I really had such a good daughter-in-law, this old man would feel like he's in heaven. I might as well give her the credit for moving the grave and tell her to move it tomorrow. The old man was about to speak when he thought it wasn't the right time! They're talking about love. If I go out and interrupt, wouldn't I become an old scoundrel!

　　Xiulan said again, "We must respect the elderly and make them happy in their hearts! If they're happy in their hearts, they'll be healthy, and we can help them live longer. We don't need the old man to do the work, just giving us advice will be good enough. We can walk to communism together with them, and let them taste how sweet a happy life is. I hope that after we get married, we'll have sons and daughters, and he'll be so happy to hold them and play with them all day long."

　　Danian laughed and pushed Xiulan, "Your little mouth is really good at making things up. You're planning on having sons and daughters before you're even married, aren't you afraid of being overheard!" The girl said, "Hey! Who would care about other people's business in the middle of the night, or hide in this grave to eavesdrop!"

　　Danian said, "You can never be sure, if you don't believe me, let's search!"
White: The old man listened: Search! What if they search me out? How embarrassing would it be for me as a father! The more flustered he became, the more unsteady he stood, and he rustled the weeds. The two of them were startled when they heard it and reached out to pick up a half brick. "Who is it?" They aimed at the tree and were about to hit it, the old man was flustered. He wanted to go out but felt embarrassed, but if he didn't go out, he was about to be hit by a brick.

　　I don't know how the three of them met, but the next day, they happily moved the graves.

### 夜逛千亩田（西河大鼓）

专栏：公社千秋

    夜逛千亩田（西河大鼓）
  　孙来奎人民公社万民欢，大跃进一步一层天，高举着总路线红旗乘胜向前
  进，奋勇猛攻大自然。千军万马排山倒海，东风社又搞了块千亩小麦丰产
  田。社员们，在地里干着活又说又
  笑，真好像，又娶媳妇又过年，半
  辈绝户把儿添，睡不着觉的
  那么喜欢！这一天，秀兰姑娘吃罢晚饭，去找队长王大年。今夜间麦田里要浇水，他二人，要去把垅沟检查一番。一进门刚来到天井院，就听见爷俩在屋里正吵的欢。大姑娘，不了解情况没法去劝，只好先站在门外边。就听老头说：“你小子成天叫
  我生气，气死我你有什么光
  沾！”大年说：“一说你落后你就生
  气，有什么理由你也谈谈。”老头子说：“土改时斗争大地
  主，头一个数我干的欢。合作化运动一开始，头个报名我占了先。人民公社一建立，投资我先拿的钱。大跃进以来我更带劲，也参加了大搞千亩田。凭哪点你说我落后？讲不出道理来咱俩没完！”大年说：“对！过去你是很进
  步，现在你可落到后边。千亩田搞的那么好，从开始你只干了三天。三天后不但没去干，为什么让你去看看你都发烦？”老人说：“后来不去我是有了
  病，如没病，我比你小子干的还
  欢！”大年说：“既有病为啥请医生
  你拦挡？”老头说：“我怕治病花些个钱。”大年说：“爹爹也不用巧遮盖，我早就知道你的病源。就因为千亩田有几块坟地太碍
  事，社员们都自愿迁出去你不迁。不迁坟，还站到地里讲风水，惹的那大人孩子都把你围严。指划着喊你个老迷信，才闹的你跑回家永不到千亩
  田。”老人一听一瞪眼：“你小子少拿这事跟我胡缠！讲风水我算不了什么短，你懂人事才懂了几天！要不是老坟的风水好，你想当这个队长难上难。”大年说：“既然咱风水这么好，为什么老辈子穷的那么可怜？自从来了共产党，咱分房分地才有了吃穿。自古来，帝王家欺骗人民闹风
  水，也挡不住改朝换代丢江山。解放前，地主们自夸他风水好，也难挡住人民革命把他推翻！旧社会听天由命讲风水，全都是蒙人的迷魂圈。爹爹你趁早别信这一套了，
    咱不如趁早把坟迁。”
    王大年是好心好意的把爹劝，
    怎知道老头子更气的怒发冲
      冠：
    “你小子少给我上这种没用的
      课，
    说出大天来我也不迁！
    谁说我落后我也不怕，
    我死后还埋到这里边。”
    越说越恼越有气，
    叭叭叭，拍的桌子直动弹。
    张秀兰听着这事要不妙，
    赶紧进屋忙插言，
    说：“老大伯，为啥事值得这
      么生气？
    自己的儿说话不对了应该包
      涵。
    你先消消气睡觉吧。”
    说着话，给老人装上了一袋烟。
    “大年哥，没事就赶快跟我走，
    去把咱的工作谈一谈。”
    拉着大年出门去，
    老头子咣当就把屋门关，
    咕咚一声躺在炕，
    哼啊唉的不耐烦：
    这小子啥事也没叫我生过气，
    为这片坟，成天价气我老没完。
    任凭你小子怎么闹，
    儿子想管爹难上难！
    只气的躺不稳也坐不住，
    一袋一袋的光抽烟。
    忽然一想，人人都说千亩田好，
    是不是我也去看一番？
    不行！这些日子，我只要一出
      大门口，
    人们就指指划划的把我谈。
    现在去，碰见人给我句难听的
      话，
    岂不叫我进退两难！
    又一想，唉！他们有来言我有
      去语，
    难道说为这点事我就永远不敢
      见天！
    他这才起身下炕来到门外，
    看了看，月明如镜星满天。
    脚步跄踉往前走，
    出村一直奔正南。
    来到地里看了看，
    嗬！到处面貌大改观！
    咚咚咚，锅驼机声似战鼓，
    哗哗哗，垅沟水声似流泉。
    光闪闪，对面灯光如白昼，
    亮堂堂，一条大道在眼前。
    不见了多年的卧龙岗，
    也没有了古来的老龙潭。
    对面上，有一座彩门高又大，
    大个的电灯上边安。
    横批上，大笔草书七个字，
    写的是：千亩小麦丰产田！白：这老人来到彩门之下举目一
      看，不由得大吃一惊，哎呀！
      这就是千亩小麦丰产田哪！
      但只见：
    千亩丰产田，就是不简单。跃
  进门高有三丈，刷红漆特别威严。
  大电灯上边安，光华闪闪似白天。
  赤金字写对联，意志坚强干劲冲
  天。上联写：鼓足干劲争第一；
  下联配：丰产奇迹天下传。跃进
  门里看，更是一洞天。当中是大
  道，两边是麦田。夸麦田，赞麦
  田，麦田就是不平凡。畦子规格
  化，分寸不能偏。三丈长，一丈
  宽，好像大地墁方砖。垅沟一条
  线，畦节似棋盘。麦垅似墨线，
  麦苗似绿毡。里边讲究几个字，
  是平直净壮湿硬宣。要说平：地
  面平、畦底平、垅沟平、田间平、
  到处平似镜。要说直：垅沟直、麦垅直、畦背直、畦节直、道边直、地边直、笔管条直没点弯。要说硬，沟壕垫的硬。要说宣，深翻土地宣。要说壮，分层施肥壮。要说湿，机器灌溉永不干。要说净，地里地外处处净，连根鸡毛都不许沾。
  正北上，一块田，楼上楼的天外天。电灯泡挂了一大片，离地不过一尺三。白天阳光照，晚上还烤电。不是闹特殊，大胆作试验，试验今年迎明年。木牌上标语口号：凌云志冲霄汉。上写：麦田里英雄立擂，坚决把乾坤扭转。要在省里当冠军，要在全国拔状元，坚决管好这丰产田！老人看罢暗称赞，哎呀呀好！好一个千亩小麦丰产田，
  老人越看越希罕！
    “像这样花园一般的大麦地，
  我真是头次才看见，果然名不
    虚传！
  公社化刚开始，土地就变成这
    个样。
  再要是努力大干一二年，处处
  安上发电站，干活完全用机器，
  条条渠沟变水田，化肥农药大
  量有，粮食丰收堆成山，幸福
  的生活就更香甜！
  赶明天，我一定和社里讲一讲，
  要求在这地里干几年！”
  老人家越看越高兴，
  走到这边又蹓到那边。
  不住的伸手扒扒麦子垅，
  又尝尝土质是咸是甜。
  走着走着忽然一楞，
  两脚站住不动弹：
    “咦！这地方为什么这么难看？
  水垅沟七扭八道弯！
  野草荆棘一大片，
  正占在麦田的地中间。
  哼！既要好就应该全都搞好，
  为什么还留着这地方讨人嫌！”
  心里埋怨着仔细一看，
  正是他自己家的坟地在眼前。
  这老人看明白立刻打了个冷
    战，心中好像刀子剜。
  真难怪我儿子为它和我致气，
  看起来，说我是个顽固真不冤。
  人人要办事都像我，
  怎能够搞好这千亩丰产田？
  赶明天我一定和儿子讲一讲，
  俺爷俩赶快把坟迁。
  老人家自己心中正悔恨，
  猛抬头见对面来了俩青年。
  他光恐怕撞见了再揭他的短，
  赶紧躲在了坟头后边。
  偷偷的留神仔细看，
  来的正是自己的儿子王大年。秀兰姑娘也来到，他俩人，每人还扛着个大铁锨。老头子看着可有了气：好小子！这一定是偷偷来把坟
  迁！为这事还找了个女帮手，还打算今晚上都迁完。迁不迁坟我说了算，我决不能落个怕儿，惧你大年！你这么干，我明知错也要错到
  底，常言说：大丈夫做事宁折不弯！这老人气的是真够呛，怎知道，这俩人来到就扔下了
  锨。看了看，这么些地方那里也不
  坐，怎么这么巧，偏坐到老人他的
  面前。一坐下，大年就拉住了秀兰的
  手，秀兰也紧靠住大年的肩。老人一看就明白了，原来是跑到这儿来把爱情谈。好小子，你们那里谈爱谈不了？是怎么偏坐到老子我的面前！我听吧看吧太不对劲，不看吧，把我挤到这儿又不能
  动弹。唉！怎么着我算不能动了，你们爱怎么谈就怎么谈！大年说：“咱今晚干的是真不
  慢，工夫不大，把所有的垅沟都检
  查完。”姑娘说：“不但咱俩的干劲大，社员们大跃进，都干的特别
  欢！”大年说：“哎！人们可都看出
  咱俩人好啦。背地里七嘴八舌的乱说咱！”姑娘说：“嗨！我们是劳动相
  交，正确的爱，他们爱怎么泛泛就怎么泛泛！单等着小麦丰收作采礼，登记结婚就往一块搬！”大年说：“咱俩人结婚全都好，就是两家老人差着地天！你家爹爹多么进步，六十多岁又成了党员。领导上照顾他年老，不叫把活
  干，急的他剃掉了胡子就装青年。我家爹爹就太落后，这块坟，他咬着个牙的就是不
  迁！一劝他就和我瞪眼，谁知道他顽固到多?才算完！”姑娘说：“大年哥为这事可不
  能犯急躁，对老人要好好劝说要耐烦。老人们对新事物一定会有时看
  不惯，谁让他在旧社会生活了这些
  年。今天不行明天再劝，明天不行还有后天。只要是耐心和老人讲，早晚他一定会把坟迁。这老人的脾气我知道，什么事也没落过后边。你别看，今天还有这块坟地，明天就许叫咱们迁。”老人越听越高兴：好一个聪明伶俐的张秀兰！说出话来这么懂事，从心眼里叫我喜欢，我真有这么个好儿妇，老头子我也算上了天。我不如把迁坟的面子就甩给
  她，告诉她明天就把坟迁。老人家随着就要说话，一想不行，不是时间！人家正
  把爱情谈。我要是出去一插嘴，岂不成了个老不贤！秀兰又说：“咱对老人可要尊
  敬，处处叫他心里喜欢！心中高兴身体就壮，叫他结结实实的多活些年。也不用说老人家把活干，给咱出个主意就把光沾。跟咱们一同走到共产主义，
    也叫他尝尝幸福生活多么香
      甜。
    盼着咱结婚后再生下儿和女，
    叫个爷爷，他乐得成天抱着
      玩。”
    大年乐着把秀兰推了一下，
    “你这个小嘴真会编。
    没结婚，对生儿女就作计划，
    也不怕被人偷听见！”
    姑娘说：“哎！谁半夜深更爱管
      闲事，
    为听话，还老早藏在这坟地里
      边？”
    大年说：“这事可没有准，
    要不信咱俩就翻翻。”白：老人一听：翻翻！
    要翻出我来可怎么办？
    显着我这当爹的多么玄！
    心中越慌越站不稳，
    哗啦啦，碰的野草一动弹。
    俩人一听吓了一跳，
    伸手就拣起块半头砖。
    “谁呀？”照定树后就要打，
    老人可急的为了难。
    有心出去觉着难看，
    不出去眼看就要挨砖。
    也不知道，三人怎么样见的面，
    第二天，他们高高兴兴就把坟
      迁。
