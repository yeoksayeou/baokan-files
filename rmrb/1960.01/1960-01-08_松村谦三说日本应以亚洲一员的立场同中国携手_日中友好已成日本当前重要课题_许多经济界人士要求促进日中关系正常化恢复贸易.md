Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: Liberal Democratic Party advisor Matsumura Kenzo said today at a press conference in Osaka that it appears that Japan-China friendship has become an important issue for Japan today. He believes that how to develop Japan's relations with China must be seriously considered from all possible angles.

　　This leader of the anti-mainstream faction of the Liberal Democratic Party said that regarding policies toward China, one should not only think about one's own interests, but must proceed from the viewpoint of peace and prosperity in the entire Asia. It is already an era in which world peace cannot be discussed without China. While standing as a member of the liberalist country group, Japan also needs a national policy of joining hands with China from the standpoint of being a member of Asia. Matsumura emphasized that it is necessary for Japan to discuss promoting their relationship with China in a friendly atmosphere.

　　He said: "After his visit to China, his deepest impression was that the Chinese people are united in construction. I think that Japan should also have far-reaching national policies this year."

　　He said that within the Liberal Democratic Party, there are more and more people who express agreement with the proposition of developing Japan-China friendly relations. Especially because Japan-China relations will immediately become a problem after the signing of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." "Therefore, I will make efforts to consult with the party, not to mention consulting with people from all walks of life across party lines, and put forward good guidelines."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: Many Japanese economic figures have demanded that Japan-China relations be normalized this year in order to restore Japan-China trade. Tsunejiro Hiratsuka, chairman of Nichiro Fisheries Co., Ltd., pointed out in an article published in the organ of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association on January 5 that various issues pending between Japan and China must be resolved this year no matter what.

　　Hiratsuka condemned the fallacy currently circulating in Japan that Japan should follow the United States on the issue of resuming diplomatic relations with China. He emphasized that the issue of restoring diplomatic relations with China is not a foreign issue, but Japan's own issue, and that opening up Japan-China relations will make a great contribution to easing tensions in Asia and world peace.

　　Jiro Sakakibara, director of Toa Bussan Co., Ltd., published an article in the organ of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association on January 1, demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government change its hostile foreign policy toward China as soon as possible. He also accused the Kishi Nobusuke government of obstructing the restoration of Japan-China trade.

　　Shogoro Takahashi, director of Wako Trading Co., Ltd., when answering questions from the editorial department of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association's organ on the same day, requested that the Japanese government strive to normalize Japan-China relations on the basis of a policy of peaceful coexistence.

　　Takahashi emphasized that in order to eliminate obstacles to the normalization of Japan-China relations, Japanese economic and trade figures should further develop their activities.

　　In addition, twenty-seven well-known Japanese economic figures expressed their opinions in the organ of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association. They unanimously demanded that the Japanese government take measures as soon as possible to normalize Japan-China relations in order to restore Japan-China trade.

    松村谦三说日本应以亚洲一员的立场同中国携手
    日中友好已成日本当前重要课题
    许多经济界人士要求促进日中关系正常化恢复贸易
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本执政的自由民主党顾问松村谦三今天在大阪举行的记者招待会上说，看来日中友好已经成为今天日本的重要课题。他认为，怎样发展日本同中国的关系必须从一切可能的角度给予认真的考虑。
    这位自由民主党反主流派首脑说，关于对中国的政策，不应该只是打算盘，而必须从整个亚洲的和平和繁荣观点出发。目前已经是撇开中国就谈不到世界和平的时代。日本在站在自由主义国家集团的一员这个立场的同时，也需要有从亚洲一员的立场同中国携手的国家政策。松村强调日本有必要同中国在友好的气氛中在一起讨论促进它们的关系。
    他说：“他参观了中国以后，印象最深的是，中国国民正在团结一致进行建设。我认为，日本今年也应该具有远大的国家政策。”
  他说，在自由民主党内，表示赞同发展日中友好关系的主张的人多起来了。特别是因为在签订新的日美“安全条约”以后，日中关系立刻会成为一个问题。“所以，我要进行努力，同党内商谈是不用说了，而且要同各阶层国民进行超党派的商谈，提出很好的方针”。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：许多日本经济界人士要求在今年促使日中关系正常化，以便恢复日中贸易。日鲁渔业公司董事长平塚常次郎在1月5日出版的日本国际贸易促进协会机关报上发表文章指出，无论如何在今年内必须解决日中两国之间悬而未决的各项问题。
    平塚谴责目前在日本国内流传的主张在同中国恢复邦交问题上应该追随美国的谬论。他强调指出，同中国恢复邦交的问题不是外国的问题，而是日本自己的问题，并且打开日中关系将对缓和亚洲紧张局势和世界和平作出巨大贡献。
    东工物产公司董事榊原二郎在1月1日出版的日中贸易促进会机关报上发表文章，要求岸信介政府尽速改变敌视中国的外交政策。他并且指责岸信介政府阻挠恢复日中贸易。
    和光交易公司董事高桥庄五郎在同一天的日中贸易促进会机关报上答复这家报纸编辑部的问题时，要求日本政府在和平共处政策的基础上，努力促使日中关系正常化。
    高桥强调指出，为了扫除阻挠日中关系正常化的障碍，日本经济、贸易界人士应该进一步展开活动。
    此外还有二十七名日本经济界著名人士在日中贸易促进会机关报上发表意见，他们一致要求日本政府尽速采取措施，促使日中关系正常化，以便恢复日中贸易。
