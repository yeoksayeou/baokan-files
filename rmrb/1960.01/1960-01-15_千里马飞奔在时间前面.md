　　**Chollima Gallops Ahead of Time**
　　*Our Correspondent* Wang Yuzhang
　　Rapid Advance, Myriad Horses Galloping
　　Amidst the flying snowflakes, the new year has arrived again. On the vast land of northern Korea, the production increase movement launched by the working people is in full swing. Having mounted the Chollima, the Korean people achieved the historic victory of completing the industrial output value plan of the first Five-Year Plan two and a half years ahead of schedule by the end of June 1959, and exceeding it by 13% at the end of the year. They are striding into 1960 with full confidence, having made brilliant achievements in all aspects of socialist construction.
　　1959 was a year of great change in Korea. The Chollima Movement launched by the Korean people further expanded and developed on a larger scale, with the momentum of myriad horses galloping. In this year, Korean industry, which had been developing at an average annual rate of 42% since the war, increased by another 50% compared with 1958, and the industrial output value reached seven times that of the pre-war year of 1949. In agriculture, a bumper harvest was generally reported for various crops. Education, culture, art, and science and technology have all made considerable progress. All aspects and corners of northern Korea are a scene of prosperity.
　　The wise and correct leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea and the respected leader of the Korean people, Comrade Kim Il-sung, is the fundamental guarantee for the great victory of the Korean people in 1959. In this year, the Workers' Party of Korea, with the spirit of continuous innovation and continuous advancement, successively formulated and adopted a series of creative economic and cultural policies and measures. Because these policies and measures are in line with the actual situation in Korea and the requirements of social and economic development, they have quickly achieved great results. In addition, the leaders of the Party and the government, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, often spend a long time going deep into the masses, inspecting and giving specific guidance to production and construction in factories, enterprises, and agricultural cooperatives in various regions of northern Korea, so that the leadership is more closely integrated with the masses, and the Party and the people are more united, and the Party's policies are more deeply implemented.
　　1959 was a year of great development of mass movements in Korea's socialist construction. The Workers' Party of Korea resolutely believes in and relies on the masses, and uses the method of launching large-scale mass movements in all aspects to promote socialist construction and implement the Party's various policies. In this way, in the Chollima Movement, a nationwide mass movement, movement followed movement, and movement connected with movement. In these heated mass movements, the heroic spirit of the broad masses of the Korean working people in despising difficulties, and their spirit and strength of self-reliance have been highly developed, making the socialist construction of Korea appear in a vigorous, blossoming, and galloping situation.
　　Strengthened the Heavy Industry Base
　　According to the fundamental economic policy of the Workers' Party of Korea, which has adhered to the priority development of heavy industry and the simultaneous development of light industry and agriculture since the war, Korea further expanded and strengthened its heavy industry base in 1959, especially the rapid development of the historically weak machine-building industry. In this way, it is now able to build modern production equipment and manufacture heavy machinery on its own. The historically deformed nature of the economy caused by the long-term colonial rule of Japanese imperialism has been completely eliminated.
　　At the beginning of 1959, the Workers' Party of Korea put forward the resounding slogan of "Steel and machinery are the kings of industry" and concentrated its efforts on developing the iron and steel and machinery industries.
　　During this year, Korea restored, built, and expanded a large number of metallurgical and rolling equipment, and construction projects were carried out in all five iron and steel plants in northern Korea. Two blast furnaces with an annual capacity of 700,000 tons at the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works, a rolling workshop with an annual output of 200,000 tons of steel at the Chongjin Steel Plant, and open-hearth furnaces, electric furnaces, converters, and rolling equipment at other iron and steel plants were all completed and put into production. Due to the completion of a large number of production equipment and the improvement of production technology and equipment utilization rate, the production of iron in the first half of 1959 increased by 1.3 times compared with the first half of 1958, and the production level of iron in the fourth quarter was significantly higher than in the first half of the year.
　　In developing the machine-building industry, the Workers' Party of Korea adopted a creative measure of "machine tool production machine tool movement." This movement, launched in May 1959, called on all machine tool factories, machinery factories, all machine repair workshops, and places with machine tools to produce an average of more than one machine tool per machine tool within one year by the "May 1st" Labor Day of 1960, so that the number of machine tools in northern Korea will be doubled.
　　In this movement, the Korean workers highly developed the spirit of daring to think and act and self-reliance advocated by the Workers' Party of Korea. They basically did not use state-supplied manpower or increase raw materials, but used spare time outside of completing production plans, and used waste steel and scrap iron collected by themselves. Technicians and workers cooperated with each other to attack technology, and as a result, machine tools were produced everywhere there were machine tools. Within six months after the launch of this movement, workers in various parts of northern Korea built more than 11,000 various machine tools and simple machine tools.
　　The development of this movement has made the Korean machinery manufacturing industry develop rapidly, the machinery manufacturing technology has been rapidly popularized, and the process of Korea's industrial and agricultural technological revolution has been greatly accelerated. Some of the machine tools produced in the movement were added to the factory or machine repair workshop, and these new machine tools were used to manufacture a large number of machine parts and machines required by the factory to further expand production. In addition, a large part of the machine tools produced in the movement supported the agricultural machinery factories in local industries, and played a major role in promoting agricultural mechanization.
　　In 1959, Korea also vigorously developed the electricity, coal, and chemical heavy industry sectors. In this year, the completion of the newly built Turujiang Power Station, Guicheng Machine Tool Factory, Wonsan and Pyongyang Railway Factories, "February 8th" Madong Cement Plant and other factories also strengthened the heavy industry base.
　　Industrial Flowers Bloom Everywhere
　　Korea's local industry is a new force on the industrial front that has developed rapidly since the Central Plenary Session of the Workers' Party of Korea called for a nationwide movement to run local industries in June 1958.
　　Now, when you travel in northern Korea, you can see the scene of industrial flowers blooming everywhere. By June 1959, this type of factory had developed to 1,473 in various parts of northern Korea. During this year, an average of six or seven local factories were newly built in each city and county. These factories were further developed and consolidated in 1959, production equipment was improved and strengthened, and production technology and product quality were greatly improved. They have become a strong force in the Korean economy. The output value created by local industries in 1959 is expected to account for 34% of the total industrial output value (12.8% in 1957, 18.2% in 1958), and the consumer goods produced account for 54% of the total output of consumer goods. The development of local industries has not only produced a large number of consumer goods, agricultural tools, and building materials to meet the needs of the local people, but also played a major role in Korea's completion of the industrial output value plan of the first Five-Year Plan two and a half years ahead of schedule, and in promoting the development of Korea's entire national economy. This is a great victory for the Workers' Party of Korea's policy of actively developing local industries, and combining large and small enterprises, central industry and local industry, and combining modern technology and handicraft technology in the production of consumer goods.
　　In August 1959, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea decided to establish a local industrial system, stipulating that the task of local industries, in addition to producing consumer goods, is to develop the production of agricultural machinery and building materials to serve the promotion of agricultural mechanization and local urban and rural construction. Each province has also begun to build medium-sized comprehensive machinery factories, iron and steel plants, cement plants, and fuel bases. Korea's local industries are developing more systematically and comprehensively.
　　Three "izations" and Agricultural Bumper Harvest
　　Great changes also took place in the Korean countryside in 1959. In August 1958, after the Korean farmers all embarked on the road of collectivization, they launched a full-scale battle against nature to realize water conservancy under the call of the Workers' Party. They opened mountains and split ridges, blocked rivers and built dams, dug wells and ponds, and did a great job in the winter of 1958 to the spring of 1959, and built 9,908 large, medium, and small irrigation projects. The water canals alone were 9,246 kilometers long. The irrigated area was expanded by 377,700 chobo (approximately 15 mu per chobo), which is equivalent to three times the total irrigated area in northern Korea before liberation. In this way, 800,000 chobo, accounting for nearly half of the cultivated land in northern Korea, were irrigated.
　　Water conservancy, plus electrification and mechanization, are the three basic contents of the agricultural technological revolution proposed by the Workers' Party of Korea. In 1959, due to the launch of a mass movement to build power stations, the number of agricultural cooperatives with electricity in Korea increased from 67% at the beginning of the year to 88%. The mechanization of the Korean countryside has also made great progress. At present, there are 7,000 standard tractors (15 horsepower) and a large number of new agricultural machinery and tools in various places.
　　In addition, in 1959, the Workers' Party of Korea vigorously advocated the intensive farming method of deep plowing, close planting, and applying more fertilizer in agriculture. Agricultural cooperatives in various places widely promoted this farming method. Most of the main grain-producing areas were able to plow 30 centimeters deep, and the fertilizer accumulation movement in the winter of 1958 and the spring of 1959 prepared much more fertilizer for the crops in 1959 than in previous years. The number of rice seedlings planted per pyong (200 pyong per mu) generally reached 250. As a result, in 1959, various crops in Korea achieved large-scale high-yield production. Shangxia Agricultural Cooperative in Sariwon City, North Hwanghae Province, planted 176 chobo of rice in 1959, with an average yield of 6.2 tons per chobo, an increase of more than double the 2.7 tons in 1958. Other famous rice-producing areas in northern Korea - Namuri Plain, Twelve-Three Thousand Miles Plain, Hamju Plain, etc. - have all achieved large-scale high-yield production. Not only rice, but also corn, soybeans, and other field crops are the same. In 1959, the average yield of grain per chobo in the entire northern Korea increased by 17.6% compared with 1958, which is an astonishing proportion.
　　A New Look on the Cultural and Educational Front
　　1959 was also a year of great reform and development in Korea's education, literature, art, and science. The Chollima Movement was also widely carried out in these departments, and it bore fruitful results.
　　In this year, schools at all levels in Korea further implemented the Workers' Party of Korea's education policy of combining education and productive labor. Colleges and universities organically combined school teaching with on-site professional internships, education, and productive labor. Students spend a certain amount of time going to factories and rural areas to participate in productive labor for internships according to their majors. In addition, they also build factories and plant experimental fields in schools. In this way, the quality of education has been significantly improved because students have closely linked book knowledge with practice and combined it with production. In addition, students have also been trained and their level of political and ideological awareness has been improved. In secondary schools, students also learn basic production techniques in combination with general education, learning to drive cars, drive tractors, raise rabbits, raise silkworms, and plant experimental fields, which has become a very common thing in various middle schools.
　　At the end of October 1959, the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea further passed a resolution on reorganizing the people's education system, which is to gradually abolish high schools within two or three years and establish a secondary technical education system that closely combines general education and technical education, that is, to expand the existing two-year technical schools that enroll junior high school graduates. New higher technical schools that enroll graduates of the above-mentioned technical schools are to be established. In these two types of technical schools, general education subjects account for about half of the time, and the other time is spent learning technology and conducting production internships, and these two are closely linked to thoroughly implement the principle of combining theory and practice. In this way, students who graduate from technical schools will have the technology to participate in production, and students who graduate from higher technical schools will learn independent production technology in any department of modern production such as metallurgy, machinery, chemistry, and agriculture. They will obtain the qualifications of technicians and technicians respectively. In addition, through four years of study in these two types of technical schools, the level of general knowledge will also reach the level of existing high schools, which is connected with universities.
　　In the magnificent Chollima Movement, writers and artists also responded to the call of the Party, and in order to more deeply reflect the Chollima era of Korea, they went to factories and rural areas to further combine with the broad masses of the working people and with the infinitely rich reality. In 1959, 60 writers participated in productive labor at the grassroots level as ordinary workers and farmers for a long time, completely living with the working people and becoming one with them. The artists are the same. They work and create at the same time, and they also do popular literature and art work to help the working people to create.
　　Scientists also went to factories and rural areas, and some even moved their research rooms to factories to closely combine their scientific research with actual production.
　　New Ideas, New Styles
　　In the Chollima Movement, the Korean people are not only rapidly changing the face of their motherland and nature, but also actively transforming themselves and arming themselves with communist ideas. People's mental outlook is also changing with each passing day.
　　The "Chollima Work Team" movement launched by the Korean working class in the spring of 1959 has great significance in this regard. In the movement launched under the slogan of "working, thinking, and learning in the spirit of communism," the workers must not only excellently complete the production plan of their work team, but also help the backward, unite and help each other, so that everyone can jointly improve production, jointly improve the level of technology and culture, and make progress together. At present, more than 2,000 work teams in factories and mines in various parts of northern Korea have participated in this movement, and 167 work teams have won the honorary title of "Chollima Work Team."
　　In 1959, the revolutionary tradition education carried out by the Workers' Party of Korea had a great impact on the ideological education of the masses. Whether they are workers, farmers, cadres, or students, everyone is studying the history of the Workers' Party of Korea and learning the excellent revolutionary traditions and struggle deeds of the anti-Japanese guerrillas led by Comrade Kim Il-sung. Now, when visiting various parts of northern Korea, you can see working people and students queuing up, taking bold steps, singing passionate anti-Japanese guerrilla songs, and walking to construction sites, factories, and schools. The spirit of loving the motherland and the people, indomitable, overcoming difficulties, and fighting hard in the most difficult environment of the Kim Il-sung Anti-Japanese Guerrillas, and that kind of revolutionary passion, is vigorously burning in the blood of the younger generation in today's socialist construction upsurge. It has become a huge force, encouraging people to move forward bravely.
　　In this year, under the vigorous advocacy of the Workers' Party of Korea, especially under the exemplary appeal of the central leaders headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, the vast number of cadres further went deep into the masses, went deep into the front line, cared about the lives of workers and farmers, and ate and lived with them. This has an important role in strengthening the ties between the Party and the people, cadres and the masses, and improving the work style of leading cadres.
　　Prepare for Capturing New Heights
　　The basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, originally scheduled to be completed by 1961, have been completed ahead of schedule in 1959. The Workers' Party of Korea stipulates that the second Five-Year Plan will be implemented from 1961, and 1960 will be designated as a "buffer period."
　　The meaning of "buffer period," according to Comrade Kim Il-sung's explanation, is to prepare for a new battle to capture another high ground after capturing one high ground. Specifically, 1960 is a year to improve people's lives, consolidate the achievements made in implementing the first Five-Year Plan, and prepare for the effective implementation of the second Five-Year Plan.
　　In 1960, we must first concentrate our efforts on promoting agricultural mechanization, so that we can further consolidate agricultural cooperatives, rapidly develop agricultural productivity, and enable agriculture to maintain a balance with the rapidly developing industry.
　　In terms of industry, we must vigorously improve labor productivity and equipment utilization rate, so that the industrial production in 1960 will increase by another 12.5% compared with 1959 with the existing manpower and equipment.
　　In addition, we must vigorously develop animal husbandry, aquaculture, and vegetable production, build a large number of houses, schools, hospitals, nurseries, etc., and improve people's lives.
　　Now, 1960 has just arrived, and the Korean working people have responded to the call of the Party and have actively mobilized. Workers are working hard to tap potential, increase production, and vigorously create agricultural machinery. Agricultural cooperatives in various places are actively manufacturing and improving animal-powered agricultural machinery and tools, learning technology, and leveling land, fighting for the rapid realization of the most central task in Korea's agricultural technological revolution - mechanization. The Korean people, who are continuing to whip their horses and move forward, will surely achieve greater new victories in 1960.

    千里马飞奔在时间前面
    本报记者　王玉章
    高速前进　万马奔腾
    雪花飞扬中，新的一年又来到了。在朝鲜北部的广阔的大地上，劳动人民展开的增产运动正如火似潮。跨上千里马的朝鲜人民，在1959年取得了6月底提前二年半完成第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划，并在年底超额13％的历史性的胜利，在社会主义建设的各个方面都取得了辉煌成就，满怀信心地跨进1960年。
    1959年是朝鲜发生巨大变化的一年。朝鲜人民掀起的千里马运动在更大的范围内，以万马奔腾之势进一步扩大发展。在这一年，战后一直以平均每年递增42％的速度发展着的朝鲜工业，又比1958年跃增了50％，工业产值可达到战前1949年的七倍。农业方面各种农作物普告丰收。教育、文化、艺术和科学技术都有长足的发展。朝鲜北部的各个方面各个角落都是一片繁荣景象。
    朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成同志的英明正确的领导，是1959年朝鲜人民取得巨大胜利的根本保证。朝鲜劳动党在这一年中，以不断革新、不断前进的精神，接连地制订和采取了一系列的有创造性的经济、文化政策和措施。由于这些政策和措施切合朝鲜的实际情况和社会经济发展的要求，都迅速地收到了很大的效果。另外，以金日成同志为首的党和政府的领导人经常长时间的深入到群众中去，到朝鲜北部各个地区的工厂、企业和农业社中去视察和具体指导生产建设，使领导同群众更密切地结合，使党和人民更加团结一致，更深入地贯彻了党的政策。
    1959年是朝鲜在社会主义建设中群众运动大发展的一年。朝鲜劳动党坚决地相信群众、依靠群众，在各个方面都用大搞群众运动的方法来推动社会主义建设，贯彻党的各项政策。这样，在千里马运动这个全民性的大运动中，运动套运动，运动接运动。在这些热火朝天的群众运动中，朝鲜广大劳动人民的藐视困难的英雄气概，自力更生的精神和力量得到了高度的发挥，使得朝鲜的社会主义建设出现了轰轰烈烈、遍地开花、万马奔腾的局面。
      加强了重工业基地
    根据朝鲜劳动党在战后坚持的优先发展重工业、同时发展轻工业和农业这一根本的经济政策，朝鲜在1959年进一步扩大和加强了重工业基地，特别是迅速地发展了历史上一直较薄弱的机械工业。这样，现在已能自己建设现代化的生产设备，制造重型机械。完全消除了由于日本帝国主义的长期殖民统治所造成的历史上遗留下来的经济的畸形性质。
    在1959年初，朝鲜劳动党就提出了“钢铁和机械是工业之王”的响亮口号，集中力量发展钢铁和机械工业。
    在这一年间，朝鲜恢复、新建和扩建了大量的冶金和轧钢设备，朝鲜北部所有的五个钢铁厂都进行了建设工程。金策制铁所的年产能力共达七十万吨的两座高炉、城津炼钢厂的年产二十万吨钢材的轧钢车间，以及其他钢铁厂的平炉、电炉、转炉、轧钢设备都纷纷建成投入生产。由于大批生产设备的建成和生产技术、设备利用率的提高，1959年上半年生产的铁比1958年上半年增加了一点三倍，第四季度铁的生产水平又比上半年有显著提高。
    在发展机械工业方面，朝鲜劳动党采取了“机床生产机床运动”这样一个创造性的措施。这个从1959年5月展开的运动，号召所有的机床厂、机械厂和所有的机修车间以及有机床的地方，到1960年“五一”节为止的一年内，平均每台机床生产一台以上的机床，使朝鲜北部现有的机床数增加一倍。
    在这个运动中，朝鲜工人高度地发挥了朝鲜劳动党提倡的敢想敢干、自力更生的精神，他们基本上不用国家补充人力、增加原材料，而是利用完成生产计划以外的业余时间、利用自己搜集来的废钢废铁，技术人员和工人互相协作，猛攻技术，结果在凡是有机床的地方到处生产出了机床。在这个运动开展后的六个月内，朝鲜北部各地工人就造出了一万一千多台各种机床和简易机床。
    这个运动的开展，使朝鲜的机械制造业得到飞跃发展，机械制造技术迅速推广，大大加速了朝鲜工农业技术革命的进程。在运动中所生产出的机床，一部分补充了本厂或机修车间，利用这些新机床大量制造本厂所需的机器零件和机器，以进一步扩大生产。另外一大部分在运动中生产出的机床，支援了地方工业的农业机械厂，对促进农业机械化起了重大的作用。
    在1959年，朝鲜还大力发展了电力、煤炭和化学重工业部门。在这一年，朝鲜新建的秃鲁江发电站、龟城机床厂、元山和平壤两座铁道工厂、“二·八”马洞水泥厂等工厂的建成，也加强了重工业基地。
      工业花朵遍地开
    朝鲜的地方工业，是在1958年6月朝鲜劳动党中央全会号召展开全民性运动办地方工业以后，迅速发展起来的工业战线上的一支新军。
    现在，你在朝鲜北部旅行，到处都可以看到工业花朵遍地开放的景象。到1959年6月为止，朝鲜北部各地这种工厂发展到一千四百七十三个。在这一年的期间内，平均每个市、郡新建了六、七个地方工厂。这些工厂在1959年进一步发展巩固，生产设备得到改善和加强，生产技术和产品质量大为提高，已成为朝鲜经济中的一支强大的力量。地方工业在1959年创造的产值，预计在工业总产值中可占34％（1957年占12．8％，1958年占18．2％），生产的消费品占消费品总产量的54％。地方工业的发展，不仅生产了大量的消费品和农具、建筑材料，满足了当地人民的需要，而且对朝鲜提前二年半完成第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划，对促进朝鲜整个人民经济的发展起了重大的作用。这是朝鲜劳动党积极发展地方工业，在消费品生产方面使大企业和中小企业、中央工业和地方工业并举，使现代化技术和手工业技术相结合的政策的巨大胜利。
    1959年8月，朝鲜劳动党中央常务委员会又决定建立地方工业体系，规定地方工业的任务除了以生产消费品为主外，还要发展农业机械和建筑材料的生产，为促进农业机械化和地方的城乡建设服务。各道也开始建设中等规模的综合机械厂、炼铁厂、水泥厂和燃料基地。朝鲜的地方工业正在更加系统地全面地发展着。
    三“化”和农业丰收
    1959年在朝鲜农村也发生了很大的变化。1958年8月，朝鲜农民在全部走上了合作化的大路以后，在劳动党的号召下，为了实现水利化，向大自然展开了全力作战。他们开山劈岭，拦河修坝，打井挖塘，1958年冬天到1959年春天大干了一场，修成了九千九百零八个大、中、小型灌溉工程，光挖的水渠就有九千二百四十六公里长。一下子扩大了三十七万七千多町步（每町步约合十五市亩）灌溉面积，这等于解放前朝鲜北部灌溉总面积的三倍。这样就使在朝鲜北部的耕地中占将近一半的八十万町步获得了灌溉。
    水利化加上电气化和机械化，是朝鲜劳动党提出的农业技术革命的三项基本内容。1959年由于开展了群众性的建设电站的运动，朝鲜的农村由年初的67％的农业社有电增加到88％的农业社有电。朝鲜农村的机械化也有很大发展，目前各地已有七千标准台（十五马力）拖拉机和大量的新式农业机械、农具。
    另外，在1959年，朝鲜劳动党在农业方面大力提倡深耕、密植、多施肥料的集约农作法。各地的农业社广泛地推行了这个耕作法，在主要粮产区大部分都作到深耕三十厘米，1958年冬天和1959年春天的积肥运动为1959年的农作物准备了比往年多得多的肥料。一般水稻插秧的蔸数每坪（二百坪为一亩）达到二百五十蔸。结果1959年朝鲜各种农作物都取得了大面积的高额丰产。黄海北道沙里院市上下农业社1959年种植了一百七十六町步水稻，平均每町步的产量达到六点二吨，比1958年的二点七吨增加了一倍还多。朝鲜北部的其他著名水稻产区——那慕里平原、十二三千里平原、咸州平原等地都获得大面积丰产。不仅水稻如此，玉蜀黍、大豆等农田作物也是如此。1959年整个朝鲜北部粮食每町步的平均产量比1958年增加了17．6％，这是一个惊人的比例。
      文教战线气象新
    1959年也是朝鲜的教育、文学、艺术、科学大改革大发展的一年。千里马运动在这些部门同样大开展，并结出了丰硕的果实。
    朝鲜的各级学校在这一年进一步贯彻了朝鲜劳动党的教育和生产劳动相结合的教育政策。大专学校把学校教学和现场专业实习、教育和生产劳动有机地结合起来。学生们根据自己的专业抽出一定时间下厂下乡去参加生产劳动进行实习，另外也在学校里建设工厂、种试验田。这样由于使学生把书本知识密切联系了实际，结合了生产，教育质量有显著提高，另外，也使学生受到锻炼，提高了政治思想觉悟水平。在中等学校里，学生们结合一般教育也学习基本生产技术，学习开汽车，开拖拉机，养兔，养蚕，种试验田，在各个中学里已成为很普遍的事情。
    1959年10月底，朝鲜最高人民会议更进一步通过关于改组人民教育体制的决议，要在二、三年内逐渐取消高中，建立一般教育和技术教育密切相结合的中等技术教育体系，就是要扩大现有的招收初中毕业生的二年制技术学校。新设招收上述技术学校毕业生的高等技术学校。这两种技术学校，一般普通教育科目约占一半时间，另外的时间学习技术和进行生产实习，并使这两者紧密联系，彻底地实现理论和实践相结合的原则。这样在技术学校毕业的学生将具有能够参加生产的技术，在高等技术学校毕业的学生将学到冶金、机械、化学、农业等现代生产的任何一个部门的独立的生产技术。他们将分别取得技工和技术员的资格。另外，通过这两种技术学校四年期间的学习，普通知识水平也达到现有的高中的水平，这就同大学相衔接起来了。
    在气势磅礴的千里马运动中，作家、艺术家们也响应党的号召，为了更深入地反映朝鲜的千里马时代，纷纷下厂下乡，进一步同广大劳动人民、同无限丰富的实际相结合。在1959年就有六十名作家作为一个普通的工人和农民长期在下面参加生产劳动，完全同劳动人民生活在一起，打成一片。艺术家们也是如此。他们一边劳动，一边创作，还一边作普及文学艺术的工作，帮助劳动人民来进行创作。
    科学家们也下厂下乡，有的甚至把研究室搬到工厂里去，把自己的科学研究同实际生产紧密结合起来。
      新思想、新风格
    在千里马运动中，朝鲜人民不仅在迅速地改变着祖国和大自然的面貌，而且在积极地改造自己，用共产主义的思想来武装自己。人们的思想面貌也在日新月异地变化着。
    朝鲜工人阶级在1959年春季发起的“千里马作业班”运动，在这方面有重大的意义。在“以共产主义的精神来工作、思想、学习”的口号下展开的运动中，工人们不仅要出色地完成本作业班的生产计划，还要帮助落后，团结互助，使大家共同提高生产，共同提高技术文化水平，共同进步。现在朝鲜北部各地厂矿企业中已有二千多个作业班参加了这个运动，并有一百六十七个作业班荣获了“千里马作业班”的光荣称号。
    在1959年朝鲜劳动党开展的革命传统教育在对群众的思想教育上起了很大的影响。不论是工人、农民、干部、学生，人人都在研究朝鲜劳动党的历史，学习金日成同志领导的抗日游击队的优良的革命传统和斗争事迹。现在在朝鲜北部各地访问，到处都可以看到劳动群众和学生排着队，迈着豪壮的步伐唱着激昂的抗日游击队的歌曲，走上工地、工厂、学校。金日成抗日游击队在最艰苦的环境中热爱祖国和人民的不屈不挠、克服困难、艰苦奋战的精神和那种革命的激情，旺盛地燃烧在今天社会主义建设高潮中的青年一代的血液中。它变成了一股巨大的力量，鼓舞着人们勇往直前地前进。
    在这一年，在朝鲜劳动党的有力的提倡，特别是在以金日成首相为首的中央领导人以身作则的感召下，广大干部进一步深入群众，深入现场，关心工人农民的生活，同他们同吃同住。这对加强党和人民、干部和群众之间的联系，改善领导干部的作风都有重要的作用。
  为攻占新高地作好准备
    朝鲜原规定到1961年为止的第一个五年计划的基本任务，已提前在1959年完成了。朝鲜劳动党规定，从1961年开始执行第二个五年计划，而把1960年规定为“缓冲期”。
    “缓冲期”的意思，根据金日成同志的解释，就是在攻下一个高地以后，为攻取另一个高地进行新的战斗的准备。具体的说，1960年是提高人民生活、巩固在执行第一个五年计划中取得的成就、为有效地执行第二个五年计划作准备的一年。
    1960年首先要集中力量促进农业机械化，这样就能进一步巩固农业社，迅速发展农业的生产力，使农业能同飞跃发展的工业保持平衡。
    工业方面要大力提高劳动生产率和设备利用率，以现有的人力和设备使1960年的工业生产比1959年再增加12．5％。
    另外，要大力发展畜产业、水产业和蔬菜生产，大量兴建住宅、学校、医院、托儿所等，改善人民生活。
    现在，1960年刚刚来到，朝鲜劳动人民已响应党的号召，积极动员起来。工人们努力挖掘潜力，增加生产，大力创造农业机械。各地的农业社积极制造和改良畜力农业机械和农具，学习技术，平整土地，为迅速实现朝鲜农业技术革命中当前最中心的任务——机械化而战斗。跨着千里马继续加鞭前进的朝鲜人民，在1960年一定会取得更大的新的胜利。
