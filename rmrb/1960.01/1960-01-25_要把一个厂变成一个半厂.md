Letters to the Editor

    To Transform One Factory into One and a Half Factories
    Chen Pengzhu, Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Changchun Insulation Material Factory
    After seeing the communique on the development of the national economy in 1959, the workers of our factory were very excited. Like factories and mines across the country, our factory also achieved a continuous leap forward in this year. Because we adhered to putting politics in command, vigorously launched mass movements, and vigorously promoted technical innovation, we transformed one factory into two factories.
    In 1960, we must continue to hold high the red flag of the General Line, further realize mechanization and semi-mechanization, and on the existing basis, develop from one factory into one and a half factories, and comprehensively realize the continuous leap forward in 1960.

    要把一个厂变成一个半厂
    中共长春保温材料厂委员会书记　陈鹏翥
    我厂职工看到了1959年国民经济发展情况的公报以后，感到十分兴奋。我们厂和全国各地厂矿一样，在这一年也实现了继续大跃进。由于我们坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新，使一个工厂变成了两个工厂。
    1960年，我们还要继续高举总路线的红旗，进一步实现机械化和半机械化，在现有的基础上，再由一个厂发展为一个半厂，全面实现1960年连续的跃进。
