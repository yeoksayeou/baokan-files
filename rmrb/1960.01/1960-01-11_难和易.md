    Difficult and Easy

    Can illiteracy eradication work in the streets be completed at a relatively fast pace? Can spare-time education be vigorously developed? Answers can be found in the example of Tianjin organizing street residents to study. Tianjin's experience proves that as long as the masses are fully mobilized, allowing residents in the streets and alleys to recognize the inseparable link between learning culture and national construction, and personal progress through their own experience, and giving play to the role of activists in eliminating illiteracy in the streets, organizing millions of street residents through them, and combining learning with production, many difficulties will be readily solved.
    Indeed, there are many practical difficulties in eliminating illiteracy among street residents. The question is, in the face of difficulties, should we advance knowing the difficulties or retreat knowing the difficulties? To realize the historical tasks of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, and to change the face of "poverty and blankness," we must complete the task of eliminating illiteracy. Can it be imagined that after the task of eliminating illiteracy has been completed among workers and peasants, a part of the street residents in modern cities (most of whom are family members of urban workers and cadres) will be allowed to remain illiterate? Obviously, this cannot be allowed.
    Everything is more difficult at the beginning, but slowly it will become easier and progress smoothly. In the past, it was felt that there were difficulties in running spare-time schools in factories and cultural and technical schools in rural areas. It was thought that factories were under great production pressure, where would they find time to study? The countryside is even busier, and even in winter, there is no "winter leisure" anymore. Under the encouragement of the Party's General Line, the broad masses of peasants have transformed "winter leisure" into "winter busyness." Even under such circumstances, spare-time learning in factories and rural areas has not only been established but also persisted, achieving a double harvest of production and learning. Taking the situation of Tianjin organizing street residents to study as an example, experience was gained and favorable conditions were created in the process, difficulties were overcome, and the work became easier. Moreover, there are many objective and favorable conditions that we have not fully recognized. For example, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the vast majority of young and middle-aged women have participated in street industries and various service industries, and learning politics, culture, and technology is their urgent need. At the same time, many difficulties in women's learning have been resolved by society. For example, children are admitted to nurseries, there are canteens for meals, and sewing groups for washing and mending clothes, these housework problems have been basically solved.
    Difficulty and ease are the unity of opposites. How to achieve unity? The most important point is to follow the direction pointed out by the Party's General Line: go all out and aim high. Then, all work will be done in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. Tianjin's organization of street residents to study is an example.

    难和易
    津文
    在街道中能不能以较快的速度完成扫盲工作？能不能大力开展业余教育？可以从天津市组织街道群众学习的范例中得到解答。天津市的经验证明：只要充分发动群众，使街道里巷的居民，通过自己的体验，认清学文化同国家建设、同个人进步的密不可分的联系，发挥街道中扫盲积极分子的作用，通过他们把千百万街道居民组织起来，结合生产进行学习，许多困难，就会迎刃而解。
    不错，在街道居民中扫除文盲的确存在着许多实际困难。问题是，在困难面前是知难而进还是知难而退。我们要实现技术革命和文化革命的历史任务，改变“一穷二白”的面貌，就必须完成扫盲任务。不能设想，在工人、农民中都完成了扫盲任务以后，还能允许现代化城市中的一部分街道居民（他们之中大多数是城市工人、干部的家属）继续处于文盲状态吗？显然不能够这样。
    一切事情在开头都是比较困难的，慢慢的就会得心应手顺利向前进展了。过去对工厂办业余学校，农村办文化技术学校，都觉得有困难。一想到工厂生产紧张，哪来的时间学习呢？农村更忙了，现在就是在冬天，也没有“冬闲”了，广大农民在党的总路线鼓舞下，变“冬闲”为“冬忙”了。就是在这样情况下，工厂和农村的业余学习不但办起来了，而且坚持下来了，做到了生产学习双丰收。就拿天津市组织街道居民学习的情况来看，在做的中间取得了经验，创造了有利条件，困难被克服了，工作变得比较好做了。更何况有许多客观有利条件，我们还没有充分认识呢。例如1958年大跃进以来，绝大部分青壮年妇女参加了街道的工业和各种服务性行业，学习政治、文化、技术是他们的迫切要求。同时，妇女学习中的许多困难，已经由社会给予解决了。例如孩子入托儿所，吃饭有食堂，拆洗衣服有缝纫组，这些家务事基本得到了解决。
    难和易是对立的统一，怎样求得统一？最主要之点，就是要照着党的总路线所指出的方向去做：鼓足干劲，力争上游。那末，什么工作都会做到多、快、好、省的。天津市组织街道群众学习，就是一个范例。
