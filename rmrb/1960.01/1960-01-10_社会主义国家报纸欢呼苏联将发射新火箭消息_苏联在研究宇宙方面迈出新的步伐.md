Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The news that the Soviet Union will launch a powerful test rocket into the central Pacific Ocean has aroused warm cheers in fraternal countries. People are watching with pride and excitement the new and significant steps taken by Soviet scientists in the study of the universe.

Today, newspapers in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Albania, Mongolia and other countries have published this important news in prominent positions.

Czechoslovakia's "Rude Pravo" wrote that this important news from the Soviet Union makes us foresee how quickly new victories for peaceful science and new victories for mankind are about to come.

Mrazek, an alternate doctor of technical science in Czechoslovakia, wrote in "Labor News" that another stage of interstellar travel is coming, the purpose of which is to solve the problems of returning to Earth, landing on certain planets in the solar system from cosmic stations, and conducting systematic physical research on the Moon and other planets.

"Youth Front News" emphasized that this most important news in interstellar travel since the launch of the third Soviet cosmic rocket once again confirms that Soviet science and technology are thoroughly and systematically completing the huge plan to gradually and safely introduce mankind into the universe.

In Budapest, the capital of Hungary, people showed particular interest in this important news. Next to several newsstands, people gathered in groups, excitedly discussing the matter.

"Evening News" published the news with a prominent headline, writing, "Rockets that can launch heavy Earth satellites and achieve space flight are about to land in the Pacific." The radio station here repeatedly broadcast this important news throughout the country.

Romania's "Spark" published a commentary today pointing out that from the TASS communique on the Soviet Union's launch of a powerful rocket, it can be seen that mankind has entered a new stage in conquering outer space.

The commentary stated that the astonishing thrust of the Soviet rocket is much stronger than that of the rockets already launched by the United States. The total weight of the dozen or so artificial Earth satellites launched by the United States is much lighter than the last Earth satellite launched by the Soviet Union.

The commentary said that one should remember the accuracy of the rockets manufactured by Soviet scientists and builders. The new Soviet rocket will land more accurately in the pre-designated area.

The commentary pointed out that the achievements of Soviet space science and technology serve the cause of human peace and progress. The Romanian people warmly congratulate the Soviet scientists and builders, who are at the forefront of mankind in conquering outer space, for their continuous progress.

Poland's "Warsaw Life News" published an article written by a reporter from Moscow today. The article also emphasized that the rocket to be launched by the Soviet Union is the most powerful rocket in the world, which is a great achievement of Soviet science. Albania's "Unity News" editorial stated that the Albanian people heartily congratulate the Soviet scientists for their brilliant achievements and congratulate them for being the first to open the road to the universe. Our people warmly welcome this exciting news and pay close attention to the successive victories of Soviet science.

The editorial continued that the TASS communique proves that Soviet science and technology are rapidly and accurately advancing towards the study of the universe and have left the United States behind. The editorial said that the victories achieved by the Soviet Union inspire peace-loving people all over the world.

A commentator from the Mongolian News Agency wrote that the Soviet Union has long left the most developed capitalist country, the United States, far behind in rocket technology. There is no doubt that the new Soviet rocket will be able to launch a huge space laboratory orbiting the Earth, and can also achieve space flights not only to the Moon, but also to other planets in the solar system.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th. "Komsomolskaya Pravda" published an article today entitled "High Precision," which introduced the situation of the area where the Soviet rocket will be launched to the central Pacific Ocean.

The newspaper pointed out that when the United States and Britain declared most of the Pacific Ocean as a danger zone, they were pursuing military purposes and would bring the danger of death to people. Now the small area announced by the Soviet government is entirely for another motive. This test is for new progress in mankind's conquest of the universe.

The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet rocket's landing area is far away from shipping lanes and fishing areas. The water there is 5,350 meters deep. Within this area, the United States and Britain have conducted atomic tests more than once, poisoning the air and seawater, while the Soviet rocket to be launched is the first test for scientific and peaceful purposes.

When introducing the situation around the area where the Soviet rocket will land, the article said that 400 nautical miles north of this area is the US naval base Johnston Island, where the United States has conducted atomic weapons tests. On Christmas Island, southeast of the landing site, is a British naval base, where nuclear weapons tests have also been conducted.

The closest place to the landing site is Palmyra Island, only 250 nautical miles away, where there is a US naval radio station. 600 nautical miles from the landing site is the island of Hawaii, where there is a US military airport.

The newspaper emphasized that the upcoming rocket launch is part of the outstanding achievements of Soviet scientists.

    社会主义国家报纸欢呼苏联将发射新火箭消息
    苏联在研究宇宙方面迈出新的步伐
    新华社9日讯　苏联将向太平洋中部发射强大试验火箭的消息，在各兄弟国家中引起了热烈的欢呼。人们以骄傲和兴奋的心情，注视着苏联科学家在宇宙研究方面迈出的新的、巨大步伐。
    今天，捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、波兰、阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古等国的报纸都用显著的地位刊载了这一重大消息。
    捷克斯洛伐克的“红色权利报”写道，来自苏联的这个重大消息使我们预见到，和平科学的新胜利、人类的新胜利是多么迅速地就要到来了。
    捷克斯洛伐克技术科学候补博士姆拉泽克在“劳动报”著文说，星际旅行的另一个阶段即将来临，这个阶段的目的是要解决返回地球、宇宙站在太阳系的某些行星上着陆以及对月球和其他行星进行有系统的物理研究的问题。
    “青年阵线报”着重指出，这个自苏联发射第三个宇宙火箭以来星际旅行方面最重大的消息再一次证实：苏联科学和技术正在彻底而有计划地完成使人类逐步平安地进入宇宙的胡规巨大的计划。
    在匈牙利的首都布达佩斯，人们对这则重大的消息产生了特别浓厚的兴趣。在若干报亭的旁边，人们成群地聚集在那里，兴奋地谈论这件事。
    “晚报”用醒目的标题刊载了这则消息，它写道，“可以发射重型地球卫星和实现宇宙飞行的火箭即将在太平洋降落了”。这里的电台反复地把这一重大消息传送到全国各地。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”今天发表评论指出，从塔斯社关于苏联将发射威力强大的火箭的公报中可以看出，人类在征服宇宙空间方面进入了一个新阶段。
    评论说，苏联火箭的惊人推力比美国已发射的火箭强大得多。美国所发射的十几个人造地球卫星的总重量比苏联最后发射的地球卫星还轻得多。
    评论说，应当记住苏联科学人员和建造人员所制造的火箭的精确性。苏联的新火箭将更加准确地降落在事先规定的地区内。
    评论指出，苏联宇宙科学和技术的成就是服务于人类和平与进步事业的。罗马尼亚人民热烈祝贺在征服宇宙空间方面走在人类先锋队中的苏联科学家和建造人员所取得的不断的进步。
    波兰“华沙生活报”今天刊载了记者从莫斯科写回的文章。文章也强调指出，苏联将要发射的火箭是世界上最强大的火箭，这是苏联科学的巨大成就。阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”的社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民衷心地祝贺苏联科学家获得的光辉成就，祝贺他们第一个打开了通向宇宙的道路。我国人民热情地欢迎这一令人兴奋的消息并且以极大的注意力注视着苏联科学的一个接一个的胜利。
    社论接着说，塔斯社的公报证明了苏联的科学和技术正在迅速地和准确地向研究宇宙的方面前进，并且已把美国抛在后面。社论说苏联所取得的胜利鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的人民。
    蒙古通讯社的评论员写道，苏联在火箭技术方面早已把最发达的资本主义国家——美国远远地抛在后边了。毫无疑问，苏联新的火箭将能发射绕地球旋转的巨大的宇宙实验室，同样也可实现不仅到月球，而且可以到其他太阳系行星的宇宙飞行。
    新华社莫斯科9日电　“共青团真理报”今天刊载了一篇题为“高度精确”的文章，介绍了苏联这次即将向太平洋中部发射的火箭将要降落区域的情况。
    报纸指出，美国英国将太平洋上大部地区宣布为危险区时，他们追求的是军事目的，并且会给人们带来死亡的危险。现在苏联政府所宣布的不大的区域完全是为了另一个动机。这次试验是为了人类征服宇宙的新的进步。
    报纸指出，苏联火箭下落地区离航线和捕鱼区都很远。那里的水深五千三百五十米，在这个区域内，美国和英国不止一次地进行过原子试验，毒化了那里的空气和海水，而苏联将要发射的火箭是第一次为了科学和和平目的试验。
    文章在介绍苏联火箭即将降落区域周围的情况时说，在这个区域北部四百海里处，是美国的海军基地约翰斯顿岛，美国曾在那里进行过原子武器试验。在下落地点的东南方的圣诞岛上有英国海军基地，也曾进行过核子武器试验。
    离下落地点最近的地方是巴尔米拉岛，相距只有二百五十海里，这个岛上有美国海军无线电台。离下落地点六百海里是夏威夷岛，这里有美国的军用飞机场。
    报纸强调指出，即将到来的火箭发射是苏联科学家的卓越成果的一部分。
