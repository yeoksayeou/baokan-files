　　This newspaper reports that in the Xiyou People's Commune in Yexian County, Shandong Province, a group of new-type farmers who engage in both physical labor and scientific research have emerged. Deputy Director Zhang Yongmao has created new-style farm tools such as machine grinders, feed crushers, and corn planters, and is now a part-time researcher at the Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Xu Jianmin, the leader of the Hou Lü Youth Technical Team, is a breeding expert. He and his team members have learned to use plant sexual hybridization and asexual hybridization breeding methods, learned advanced corn inbred line double-cross breeding methods, and conducted sixty-three combinations of experiments. Communist Youth League member Zhang Huanying is the "Sweet Potato King" here and was invited to participate in a breeding seminar held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in November. Wang Kejing, the young female director of the pig farm, has excellent pig disease treatment skills, and the commune members call her "Dr. Pig." Outstanding figures in various fields continue to emerge, and now the entire commune has more than 550 technicians, mechanics, and veterinarians with a certain level of expertise.

　　Where do these technical talents come from? The Xiyou People's Commune's experience over the past year suggests that running Red-Expert schools and establishing youth technical teams are two good ways to train these talents.

　　The Red-Expert school is actually the commune's agricultural technical school, but it is different from ordinary agricultural technical schools. The school is both a learning organization and a production organization. Teachers are teachers in the classroom, and production team leaders in the fields. Their curriculum includes two subjects: culture and technology. Cultural courses include junior high school Chinese, arithmetic, botany, physics and chemistry; technical courses include crop cultivation, pest and disease control, improved seed breeding, animal husbandry, machinery, and horticulture. In order to adapt to this learning method and content, the commune allocated 129 mu of land to them, and the school itself established a bacterial fertilizer factory, livestock farm, orchard nursery, etc., as places for creating high yields, conducting experiments, and labor practice. At present, there are a total of 106 students in the school, all of whom are high school graduates under the age of seventeen. Concentrating these people of this age for study and labor has little impact on the labor force arrangement of the production team. The students' lives rely entirely on the school's production income to implement the supply system, which does not require commune expenditure or family supply. Their study period is three years. After graduation, they will have a certain level of cultural and scientific knowledge and can become a new type of farmer. In order to solve the urgent needs of production, the Red-Expert school also runs short-term training courses, which have trained 124 technicians and more than 170 mechanics for the production teams in the past year.

　　The Red-Expert school cultivates technical talents by serving the commune's overall bumper harvest. Because they completely adopt new technologies for farming, the crops grow very well, and the average yield per mu for the whole year reaches more than 1,600 jin, which is twice as high as the average grain yield of the whole commune.

　　The Youth Technical Team is a unit directly under the leadership of the production brigade, generally consisting of about ten people, cultivating twenty to thirty mu of land. Their regular tasks are: to learn, experiment with, and promote new technologies; to create high yields and set examples for the entire team; to assist the production brigade in formulating technical management measures; and to be responsible for the technical guidance of large areas of high-yield fields in each small team. This is a team for conducting scientific research and disseminating technology. They often conduct experimental research on key issues in production and set an example for the production team. For example, when wheat was infested with wheat bugs, the production team sprayed 666 pesticide several times without any effect. Zhang Baoji, the leader of the Youth Technical Team, under the guidance of the Party organization, observed in the fields day and night, and finally discovered the activity patterns of this pest and found the reason why the medicine was ineffective. Based on their discovery, the commune instructed the production teams to change the time and method of spraying, and quickly eliminated it. The Youth Technical Team carefully observed and painstakingly studied in this way, mastering the habits and control methods of more than 30 kinds of pests in the local area. Variety is an important key to increasing production, so the Party organization and the Commune Party Committee entrusted the task of collecting, testing, and cultivating fine varieties to the Youth Technical Team. They have collected a large number of varieties for testing. The Hou Lü Technical Team alone has collected 274 kinds of wheat varieties and 32 kinds of corn varieties, establishing an "original variety nursery." The Wang Jia Technical Team has successfully cultivated five new corn varieties, and they have another 149 wheat hybrid combinations under experimentation. After many repeated comparative experiments, the Red-Expert School and the Hou Lü, Wang Jia, and Zhu Feng Technical Teams jointly found high-yielding varieties. Compared with local varieties, the lowest yield increase was 15%, and the highest yield increase was more than 30%. These varieties are now widely used throughout the commune, and all of them have achieved improved variety.

　　By running Red-Expert schools and establishing youth technical teams in this way, the Xiyou People's Commune enables technical talents to grow in batches, adapting to the needs of agricultural production development. At the same time, the Red-Expert schools and Youth Technical Teams, through scientific research activities and activities to serve the commune and the production teams' overall bumper harvest, enable the commune members to universally accept scientific knowledge and new production technologies.

    掖县西由公社举办红专学校和建立青年技术队大搞科学研究
    手脑并用的新型农民成批生长
    红专学校是学习组织也是生产组织，学文化也学技术　青年技术队负责学习和推广新技术，解决生产关键问题
    本报讯　在山东省掖县西由人民公社里，已涌现了一批既从事体力劳动又从事科学研究的新型农民。副社长张永茂创造了机器磨、饲料粉碎机、玉米点播器等新式农具，现在是山东省农业科学院的兼职研究员。后吕青年技术队队长徐建民是个育种能手，他和他的队员们学会了运用植物有性杂交和无性杂交的育种方法，学会了玉米自交系双交种的先进育种方法，进行了六十三个组合的试验。共青团员张焕英是这里的“地瓜大王”，11月间曾经被邀参加过中国科学院召开的育种座谈会。养猪场年轻的女场长王克英，给猪治病的技术很高，社员们称她为“猪先生”。各方面出色的人物不断地涌现出来，现在全公社已经有具备一定水平的技术员、机械手、兽医员五百五十多人。
    这些技术人才从哪里来？西由人民公社一年来的经验认为，举办红专学校和建立青年技术队是培养这些人才的两种好形式。
    红专学校实际上是公社的农业技术学校，但它又和一般的农业技术学校不同，学校既是学习组织，又是生产组织。教员在课堂上是老师，到田间就是生产队长。他们的学习课程是文化和技术两门。文化课是初中语文、算术、植物、理化；技术课是作物栽培、病虫防治、良种繁育和畜牧、机械、园艺等。为了适应这种学习方法和学习内容，公社拨给他们一百二十九亩地，学校自己建立了细菌肥料厂、牲畜饲养场、果园苗圃等，作为创高产、搞试验、劳动实习的场所。目前全校共有学生一百零六人，全是十七岁以下的高小毕业生。把这样一些年龄的人集中起来进行学习和劳动，对生产队的劳动力安排影响不大。学生的生活，完全依靠学校的生产所得实行供给制，既不用公社开支，也不用家庭供给。他们的修业年限是三年，毕业以后，都具有一定的文化科学知识水平，就可以成为一个新型农民。为了解决生产上的急需，红专学校还开办了短期训练班，一年来已经为各生产队训练了技术员一百二十四名，机械手一百七十多名。
    红专学校培养技术人才，是通过为公社的全面丰产服务而实现的。由于他们完全采用新技术耕作，庄稼长得很出色，全年平均亩产量达到一千六百多斤，比全社粮食的平均产量高一倍。
    青年技术队，是在生产大队直接领导下的一个单位，一般在十人左右，种地二、三十亩。他们的经常任务是：学习、试验、推广新技术；创造高额丰产，为全队树立标兵；协助生产大队制定技术管理措施；负责各小队大片丰产方的技术指导。这是一支进行科学研究和传播技术的队伍。他们经常针对生产中关键问题进行试验研究，给生产队作出样子。如麦子发生了谷长椿象虫害，生产队用六六六药水喷打了几次都不见效。青年技术队长张宝吉就在党组织的指导下，和技术员们昼夜白黑地在田间观察，终于发现了这种虫害的活动规律，找到了药治无效的原因。社里根据他们的发现，指示各生产队改变了喷药的时间和方法，很快地就把它消灭了。青年技术队就是这样细心观察，苦心钻研，掌握了当地三十多种害虫的习性和防治方法。品种是增产的一个重要关键，党组织和社党委就把搜集、试验、培育优良品种的任务交给青年技术队。他们已经搜集了大量的品种进行试验，只后吕一个技术队就搜集了二百七十四种小麦品种，三十二种玉米品种，建立了“原始品种圃”。王贾一个技术队就培育成功了五种玉米新品种，他们还有一百四十九个小麦杂交组合正在试验。经过多次地反复地对比试验，红专学校和后吕、王贾、诸冯三个技术队共同找到了高产品种，同当地品种比，最低的增产15％，最高的增产30％以上。现在全社普遍地使用了这些品种，全部实现了良种化。
    西由人民公社这样举办红专学校和建立青年技术队，使技术人才成批成批地生长起来，适应了农业生产发展的需要。同时，红专学校和青年技术队通过科学研究活动和为公社为生产队全面丰产服务的活动，使社员们普遍地接受了科学知识和新的生产技术。
