Heroes are as numerous as the stars, moving mountains and seas to capture the Dragon King; using forests as pens and the sky as paper, grinding seawater into ink, we cannot write enough. – Gansu Folk Song

Riddle Answer
The project briefing for the Longxi section of the Yin-Tao Project published the exemplary deeds of Guo Ruqing, the leader of the Huang Jiguang Youth Assault Team. After seeing the briefing, many workers immediately criticized: "The person who wrote this is really careless, they even got the name wrong, isn't it Guo Ruqing?" The next day, on the project site's blackboard newspaper, the list of model workers indeed wrote Huang Jiguang Youth Assault Team leader Guo Ruting, but another group of workers were dissatisfied again: "Yesterday the briefing clearly said Guo Ruqing, how did it become Guo Ruting again? The person writing this is really not careful!" A group of people surrounded the blackboard newspaper, arguing endlessly, some saying it was right, some saying it was wrong, becoming more and more confused.

Later, after inquiring, it turned out that the person writing the draft was not wrong, these were originally two people, but they were brothers, both were team leaders, and both were Communist Party members. After they arrived at the construction site, each led their team and started a competition, chasing each other closely, not yielding to each other, constantly improving project efficiency, with achievements that were indistinguishable, and both were rated as "Yin-Tao Heroes."

Mother and Son's Strange Encounter on the Construction Site
After the news of the upcoming construction of the Sangyuanxia Reservoir in Qingshui County spread, Communist Youth League member Lu Xiaojing excitedly ran home, ready to report the good news to his mother. As soon as he entered the door, he found his mother packing her luggage on the kang. He was stunned. He asked: "Mom, what are you packing for?" His mother said without turning her head:
  "Don't you know they're building a reservoir? Going to the construction site!" Lu Xiaojing was anxious, and said:
  "You're so old, how can you build a reservoir? I've already signed up." His mother said: "Being old can still contribute to the reservoir, you should just do a good job in the commune!" Who should go and who should stay? Mother and son argued, and neither convinced the other. Lu Xiaojing quietly rushed to the construction site first.

At the construction site, the canteen of Lu Xiaojing's team was particularly well-run. One day, he was eating hot and fragrant food, and was just about to write a big-character poster to praise this cook who wholeheartedly served the workers when suddenly his mother, wearing a white apron, came to him with a dish. Lu Xiaojing widened his eyes in surprise, but his mother smiled kindly and said: "You think I'm useless because I'm old! I can't do heavy work, but doing this kind of work should be better than you, right? Son, let's work hard, we must earn glory before going home."

A Song of Praise for a Loyal Heart
  "Pick the best horse from the herd, pick the枣红马 (date red horse),
  Choose the finest steel from the steel, choose the乌金钢 (black gold steel);
  Everyone praises Wang Shitou,
  A loyal heart he dedicates to the Party!"

Wang Shitou was a capable, resourceful, brave, and strong Communist Youth League member who created many outstanding deeds during the Great Leap Forward. When he was working at the Huangjiang Reservoir construction site in Xili County, the ancient city wall suddenly collapsed, and a large number of hoes, sledgehammers, crowbars, and other tools were piled on the semi-cliff under the city wall. At this time, Wang Shitou only had six words in his heart: "Rescue state property!" He immediately ran towards the semi-cliff to grab the tools. Just then, a piece of earth fell from the air and knocked him down. As soon as he got up, another large piece of earth rolled down, throwing him into the forty-zhang deep stone cliff ditch, breaking his right arm. Wang Shitou, who was unconscious, had just regained consciousness in the hospital when he anxiously asked: "Have all the tools been taken out? Is anyone injured?" After asking, he was still worried and sent a letter to the construction site to inquire. As soon as his injury healed a little, he ignored the doctor's advice and rushed to the construction site again. The song above was composed by the masses for him.

The Singing Young Man
On the large canal leading water up the mountain in Dongxiang Autonomous County – the NanYang Canal at the Bolo Gully construction site, there was a singing Dongxiang young man named Ma Kelimu. No one asked him to, he ran to the canal himself, and could not be persuaded to go home. He worked quickly and well. In a short period of time, the soil he transported could be piled into a earth mountain of a thousand cubic meters. If anyone asked him why he didn't leave NanYang Canal? He only had one sentence: "Love!" Then he would run and happily sing the "Hua'er" (folk song) he composed: "Building the NanYang Canal warms the heart, I have no heart to go home..." This was really the case: Ma Kelimu's father was sick and sent a message asking him to go home. Ma Kelimu shouted: "The canal is about to be completed, do you want me to go home? No way, I won't go home without bringing the water." The cadre repeatedly persuaded him before he decided to go home to visit his family. It was one hundred and sixty li round trip from the Bolo Gully to his home; on the third day, Ma Kelimu's high-pitched and beautiful "Hua'er" sound rang out again on the construction site.

Old Hero on Hero Lake
After the construction of the Hero Lake Reservoir in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County began, old blacksmith Xu Dengyun was the first skilled worker to sign up for the construction site. He led ten workers and used a pair of pliers and two hundred jin of scrap iron to set up a tool repair shop.

At that time, the largest workload on the construction site was transporting soil, and realizing ball bearing-ization was the most urgent task of tool reform. The Party Committee entrusted this task to the repair shop. Xu Dengyun learned the method of hot steel processing of bead blanks from several experiments, which improved work efficiency, but in terms of polishing, one person could only polish about a hundred beads a day. At this rate, when would ball bearing-ization be realized? He thought and thought, and finally figured out what a "bead grinder" should look like.

One day, he was sitting on the river bank continuing to think about this problem when he suddenly saw the water mill in the river, and his mind suddenly opened up. He immediately wove a wheel with horse lotus grass and squatted by the river to experiment. After several improvements, the bead grinder driven by the water wheel was finally successfully manufactured. It could grind more than four thousand steel balls in ten hours, and the quality was better than hand-made, saving one hundred and fifty laborers a day. Soon all the vehicles on the construction site were equipped with ball bearings. In this way, old blacksmith Xu Dengyun created and invented a total of twenty-four advanced tools on the construction site, increasing efficiency by five to two hundred times respectively. Therefore, everyone called him the "omnipotent engineer." (Attached image)

    驯水英雄谱
    移山填海擒龙君，英雄好汉多如星；树林作笔天作纸，海水磨墨写不赢。——甘肃民歌
    谜底
    在引洮工程陇西工区的工地简报上，刊登了黄继光青年突击队小队长郭汝清的模范事迹。不少民工看到简报以后，立刻批评起来：“写材料的人真是粗枝大叶，连名字都搞错了，人家名叫郭汝廷吗？”第二天，在工地黑板报写的模范名单里，果然写为黄继光青年突击队小队长郭汝廷，但另一部分民工又不满意了：“昨天简报上明明登的是郭汝清，怎么又变成了郭汝廷呢？写字的人真不细心！”一群人围着黑板报争吵不休，有的说对有的说不对，越闹越糊涂。
    后来一打听，原来写稿的人并没有错，这本来就是两个人，不过他们是兄弟，都是小队长，又都是共产党员。他俩到工地后，各带着小队，展开对手赛，你追我赶互不相让，工程效率都不断提高，成绩不分高下，都被评为“引洮英雄”。
    母子工地奇相逢
    清水县桑园峡水库准备开工的消息传开以后，共青团员鲁孝敬兴冲冲地跑回家来，准备给母亲报告这个喜讯。一进门却发现母亲正在炕上收拾行李。他楞住了。问道：“妈，你收拾东西干啥呀？”他母亲头也不回地说：
  “要修水库你不知道呀？到工地去呗！”鲁孝敬急了，就说：
  “你年纪这样大了怎么能修水库？我已经报名了。”他母亲说：“年纪大了也能给水库出点力嘛，你还是好好干社里的活吧！”谁该去谁该留？母子俩就争论开了，到底谁也没有说服谁。鲁孝敬悄悄地抢先赶到了工地。
    在工地上，鲁孝敬这个队的食堂办的特别好。一天他吃着热腾腾香喷喷的饭食，正想写张大字报去表扬这位热心为民工服务的炊事员，突然，他母亲围着白围裙端着菜来到他面前，鲁孝敬惊异地张大了两眼，母亲却慈祥地笑着说：“你认为我年纪大就没用了！做重活不行，做这种活总该比你强吧？孩子，咱母子俩好好干，一定要挣上光荣才回家。”
    赞歌一曲颂丹心
    “马里头挑马枣红马，
    钢里头选钢乌金钢；
    人人称赞的王石头，
    一颗丹心献给了党！”
    王石头是个精悍机智勇敢坚强的共青团员，在大跃进中创造了很多优秀事迹。他在西礼县黄江水库工地劳动时，古城墙突然塌陷，大批洋镐、炮锤、撬杠等工具都在城墙下的半崖上堆放着，这时，王石头心上只有六个字：“抢救国家财产！”他立刻飞步奔向半崖抢取工具，就在这时一块土基从半空掉下来把他打倒，刚爬起来又是一块斗大的土基滚下，将他冲击进四十丈深的石崖沟底，折断了一支右臂。昏迷不醒的王石头刚在医院里清醒过来，便急着问：“工具都拿出来了吗？有人受伤吗？”问罢他还不放心，又捎信去工地打听。伤刚好一些，就不顾医生的劝阻，又赶往工地。上面那支歌就是群众为他编的。
    爱唱的小伙子
    东乡族自治县引水上山的大型渠道——南阳渠菠萝沟工地上，有一个名叫马克力木的爱唱的东乡族小伙子。谁也没有叫他，他自己跑上渠来，再也劝不回家，干起活来又快又好，短短时间里他运走的土就可堆成一千公方的一座土山。谁要是问他为什么不离开南阳渠？他只有一句话：“爱?！”接着他就一边奔跑着一边欢乐地唱起自编的那首“花儿”来：“南阳渠修的人心热了，家儿里无心回了，……”还真有这样一回事：马克力木父亲有病了，捎话叫他回去一趟。马克力木就嚷着说：“眼看渠快修通了，想要我回家吗？不行，不带上水不回家。”干部一再劝说，他才决定回家探亲。从菠萝沟到他家来去一百六十里；第三天，在工地上就又响起马克力木高亢优美的“花儿”声了。
  英雄湖上老英雄
    天祝藏族自治县英雄湖水库开工后，老铁匠徐登云是第一个报名到工地的技术工人。他领着十个民工，用一把老虎钳和二百斤废铁，就办起一个工具修配厂。
    当时工地最大的工程量是运土，实现滚珠轴承化是工具改革最迫切的任务，党委把这个任务交给了修配厂。徐登云从数次试验中摸索到了热钢加工珠坯的方法，提高了工效，但在打磨光滑方面一人一天只能磨百来颗。这样下去，什么时候才能实现滚珠轴承化呢？他想呀想，到底捉摸出一个“磨珠器”的样子。
    一天，他坐在河沿上继续想这个问题，猛然看见河里的水磨，心里一下就开了窍。他立刻用马莲草编了个轮子，蹲在河边试验。经过几次改进，用水轮带动的磨珠器终于制造成功了，十个小时就能磨四千多颗钢珠，质量也比手工好，一天能节省一百五十个劳力。很快工地上所有车辆都安上了滚珠轴承。老铁匠徐登云就这样在工地上前后共创造发明了二十四种先进工具，分别提高工效五倍到二百倍，因此，人人都称他为“万能工程师”。（附图片）
