    The Speed of Earth's Rotation
    Yan Huo

    How long does it take for the Earth to rotate once? Twenty-four hours – this question is now very common knowledge. Everyone knows that one rotation of the Earth is one day and night, and one day and night is twenty-four hours. But if someone asks: Is the Earth's rotation always consistently twenty-four hours, neither faster nor slower, neither more nor less? Then few people can answer this question.

    The times of solar and lunar eclipses recorded in ancient historical records help us answer this question. People have discovered from calculations that if the Earth always rotated at its current speed, the solar and lunar eclipses that occurred thousands of years ago should have occurred several hours later than recorded in Chinese and Greek historical records. This shows that the speed of the Earth's rotation is not uniform; it was much faster thousands of years ago than it is now. Scientists have further pointed out that the Earth's rotation has not only been slowing down over a long period of time, but also that the rotation is uneven and has periodic changes in the short term. Scientists have used very precise methods to measure that, on average, each day has lengthened by one-thousandth of a second in the last century.

    Why has the Earth's rotational speed slowed down? Although this question has not been studied sufficiently at present, based on existing research results, the reasons are diverse. First of all, it is because of the tides on Earth. Tides are the result of the Moon's attraction to tiny particles on the Earth. During high and low tides, the tide moves along the Earth's surface, generating considerable friction on the Earth's surface. This friction reduces the Earth's rotation speed, just like when we gently rub a spinning top with our finger, the top's speed slows down.

    Another reason is meteorological. Every winter, hundreds of billions of tons of high-pressure air flow over the vast continent of Central Asia, and large amounts of ice and snow accumulate in temperate and polar regions. Due to the movement of large amounts of matter on the Earth's surface, the uniformity of the Earth's rotation is affected. Because of this, the speed of the Earth's rotation has "seasonal" changes. People have found that the Earth's rotation speed is slower from October to May of the following year; after May, it gradually accelerates until October. Scientists have pointed out that this is the main reason for the periodic changes in the Earth's rotation in the short term.

    In addition, the movement of large amounts of matter inside the Earth, the expansion and contraction of the Earth, and other factors all affect the speed of the Earth's rotation. When the Earth expands, its rotation speed slows down, and when the Earth contracts, its rotation speed accelerates. This is the same principle as when we rotate our body, extending our arms to slow down the rotation and retracting our arms to speed up the rotation. Some scientists have pointed out that the expansion and contraction of the Earth are likely to be factors that cause its long-term uneven rotation.

    The unevenness of the Earth's rotation speed is, of course, imperceptible in people's daily lives, and its impact is negligible. However, it is of extreme importance to certain scientific departments (astronomy, geophysics, and geology), so this issue has become an important topic in current geophysical research.

    地球转动的快慢
    言火
    地球自转一转多少时间？二十四小时——这个问题在目前已经是很普通的常识了。大家都知道地球自转一转就是一昼夜，一昼夜是二十四小时。可是若是有人问道：地球自转一转始终是不快不慢、不多不少的二十四小时吗？那么这个问题就很少有人能够回答出来。
    古代史籍中记载的日蚀和月蚀的时间帮助我们回答了这个问题。人们从计算中发现，如果地球始终以现在的速度旋转的话，那末几千年前的日蚀和月蚀发生的时刻应当比中国和希腊的史籍中记载的晚好几个小时。这说明地球转动的快慢并不是均匀的；在几千年前要比现在快得多。科学家们进一步研究指出，地球的旋转不但在长时期中一直在慢下来，并且旋转的不均匀，在短时期内还具有周期性的变化。科学家用极精确的方法测出在近百年中平均每昼夜要拉长千分之一秒。
    地球旋转的速度为什么会减慢呢？对于这个问题，目前虽然还研究得不够充分，但根据已有的研究结果，说明原因是多种多样的。首先是因为地球上有潮汐的缘故。潮汐是月球对于地球上微小质点吸引的结果，在涨潮和退潮的时候，潮水沿着地球表面移动，它们对地球表面产生不小的摩擦力。这摩擦力就会减低地球的转速，就好像当我们用手指轻轻擦着旋转的陀螺时，陀螺的速度就会减慢一样。
    另一个原因是气象上的原因。每当冬天，中亚细亚广袤的大陆上空流过几千亿吨的高压空气，温带和两极积起了大量的冰雪。由于地球表面上大量物质的移动，就影响到地球旋转的均匀性。也由于这样，地球旋转的快慢就有了“季节性”的变化。人们发现，一年之中从10月到来年5月，地球自转的速度较慢；5月以后又逐渐加快，直至10月。科学家们指出这是造成地球旋转在短时期内周期性变化的主要原因。
    除此以外，地球内部大量物质的移动，地球的扩大和收缩等都是影响地球旋转快慢的因素。当地球扩大时，它的转速会减慢，当地球收缩时，转速就会加快。这和我们旋转身体时，伸开手臂使旋转减慢，收拢手臂使旋转加快的道理一样。有些科学家指出，地球的扩大与收缩很可能是造成它长时期中旋转不均匀的因素。
    地球旋转快慢的不均匀在人们的日常生活中，当然无法察觉，其影响也是微不足道的。可是对于某些科学部门（天文学、地球物理学与地质学）来说却具有极重要的意义，因此这个问题已成为目前地球物理学研究的一个重要课题。
