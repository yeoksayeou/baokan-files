    East wind brings glad tidings far and wide,
    Glad tidings shake our hearts.
    Standing on the Kunlun Mountains, we shout loudly:
    The victory belongs to the Chinese people!
    Chinese people, Chinese people,
    With bones of steel and tendons of iron,
    In two years—
    How many nights slept by the steel furnace;
    How many times stood firm in the floods...
    Reaping a great harvest despite drought and flood,
    Born with the strength to subdue dragons and tigers!
    The Party—the great helmsman,
    Steering the ship of the class,
    Completing a five-year voyage in two years,
    This is: the Chinese-style Great Leap Forward!
    Look! The mountains raise their arms and cheer,
    Listen! The rivers sing aloud,
    Ten thousand miles of east wind, ten thousand miles of song:
    Singing the Party's great merits!
    "A thousand sails pass by the sunken boat,
    Ten thousand trees flourish before the diseased tree."
    Let the insects buzz and chirp on the side,
    We will still spur our horses to gallop!
    East wind brings glad tidings far and wide,
    Glad tidings increase our vigor by leaps and bounds,
    The fire in the steel furnace is red and bright,
    —That is our leaping heart!
    The sound of the air hammer shakes the earth,
    —That is all our strength!
    When the wintersweet blooms again next year,
    Then see: our victory will be even more astonishing!

    东风万里送喜讯
    北京第一机床厂工人　王恩宇
    东风万里送喜讯，
    喜讯震动着我们的心。
    站在昆仑山巅大声喊：
    胜利了的是中国人！
    中国人，中国人，
    钢的骨头铁的筋，
    两年中——
    几度炼钢炉边眠；
    几度洪水里稳立身……
    旱涝中夺得大丰收，
    生来就有降龙伏虎劲！
    党——伟大的舵手，
    驾驶着阶级的巨轮，
    五年的航程两年走完，
    这就是：中国式的大跃进！
    看！群山举臂欢呼，
    听！江河放声歌吟，
    万里东风万里歌：
    歌颂党的大功勋！
    “沉舟侧畔千帆过
    病树前头万木春。”
    任你虫儿一旁噪叫，
    我们仍要策马飞奔！
    东风万里送喜讯，
    喜讯万里增干劲，
    炼钢炉中火正红，
    ——那是我们的跃进心！
    空气锤声震天地
    ——那是我们的浑身劲！
    来年腊梅再开时，
    且看：我们的胜利更惊人！
