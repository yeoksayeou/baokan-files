Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 22nd. TASS, Moscow: Soviet Academy of Sciences Vice President Topchiev told TASS reporters that the launch of a Soviet multi-stage ballistic rocket into the predetermined Pacific region is a most significant step on the planned road to conquering the universe.

He also said that the rocket flew about twelve thousand five hundred kilometers, and its landing point deviated from the predetermined landing point by less than two kilometers. The accuracy of the rocket launch is unimaginable.

Topchiev emphasized the high degree of accuracy of the rocket control system and the measuring equipment on the rocket. He also pointed out that this rocket, intended for launching heavy Earth satellites and for cosmic flights to the planets of the solar system, has a rare accuracy at the time of launch.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 22nd. TASS: Soviet scientists gave extremely high evaluations to the results of launching a powerful ballistic rocket into the Pacific region.

Professor Fedorov, a famous Soviet rocket and artificial satellite expert and Academic Secretary of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that this launch is a new and important stage in humanity's approach to making the first flight to the planet closest to Earth.

Academician Gnedenko, a Ukrainian mathematician, pointed out that the astonishing accuracy achieved when the rocket fell and the operation of the model of the rocket's final stage as it passed through the dense atmosphere are of utmost importance for the work of safely returning rockets to Earth.

Professor Konstantinov, Director of the Institute of Physical Technology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, pointed out that the results of launching a new, more powerful multi-stage ballistic rocket are amazing in at least three aspects. First, the landing point of the model of the rocket's final stage deviated from the predetermined landing point by only one-six-thousandth of the range. Second, at all points of the rocket's orbit, including within the dense atmosphere of the landing area, radio contact was maintained between the Earth and the rocket. Third, the heat shield of the final stage model was so reliable that it completely prevented the model of the final stage rocket from burning up when traveling at high speed in the lower atmosphere.

Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and mathematician Linnik pointed out that the quality of the adjustment and calculation equipment used to control the rocket's flight is very high.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 22nd. Following the successful launch of a powerful multi-stage rocket, Soviet scientists published articles in Soviet newspapers on the 22nd, discussing the great scientific significance of the new Soviet rocket.

The famous scientist Dobronravov pointed out in an article published in the "Moscow Truth" that the Soviet Union far surpasses all other countries in all major aspects of modern technology. Therefore, the new work of studying the universe that the Soviet Union is preparing to carry out with rockets this year is a logical and lawful continuation of the achievements already made in this area. The Soviet Union's achievements in mastering the universe are guaranteed by many conditions related to the overall prosperity of Soviet science and technology.

He said that the characteristic of the model of the final stage of this rocket is that it will not burn up when passing through the dense atmosphere of the Earth. This characteristic is of great significance for the future manufacture of artificial satellites that can return to Earth.

Dobronravov said that although the new rocket is larger than the cosmic rockets launched by the Soviet Union in the past, its penultimate stage, together with the model of the final stage, reached a speed of more than 26,000 kilometers per hour, almost equal to the first cosmic velocity (29,000 kilometers per hour). This shows that if the final stage of a future larger cosmic rocket is equipped with an engine, it will not only be able to obtain the second cosmic velocity (11.2 kilometers per second), but will even exceed this speed, reaching a speed sufficient not only to fly to the moon, but also to fly to the planets of the solar system.

Dobronravov said that the manufacture of heavy Earth satellites is beneficial for solving the problem of further developing interplanetary transportation. Launching heavier cosmic rockets to the planets of the solar system has the same significance. A control system can be installed on heavy Earth satellites to control their direction in the air. This orientation will help complete more valuable scientific research. Telescopes can even be installed on heavy Earth satellites to take pictures of the starry sky. A braking device can also be installed on heavy Earth satellites. When the satellite enters the dense atmosphere of the Earth, the braking device can brake the satellite. Finally, a device can be installed on a heavy Earth satellite to ensure that the satellite passes through the entire atmosphere and lands on the ground.

Soviet mathematician Sobolev said in an article published in "Truth" that the successful testing of a powerful multi-stage ballistic rocket brings closer the date when scientists will realize the ideal of obtaining complete data about the Moon, Mars and Venus. The first task of space navigators will be to use these celestial bodies to build powerful observatories for studying the universe. Sobolev predicted: We will probably also see the construction of observatories on the Moon and Mars.

Technical Science Associate Doctor Berelman made the following comparison when evaluating the accuracy of the new Soviet rocket in "Communist Youth League Truth": It is like using a rifle to hit an apple with a small pellet ten kilometers away, and the bullet lands only a few millimeters from the center of the apple. He also mentioned the words of Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, that in the last seven years, automatic rockets will first study the space around the moon, and then fly to the planets closest to Earth in the solar system. The Soviet people are successfully solving this magnificent task.

Astronomer and Doctor of Physics and Mathematics Nikonov of Leningrad, who also published an article in "Communist Youth League Truth," also said that powerful cosmic experimental ships will fly to the nearest planets, and powerful external Earth observatories will reveal new and supreme possibilities for studying celestial bodies.

Varvarov, in a commentary on the new major experiment successfully conducted by the Soviet Union in rocket technology in the "Soviet Navy News," especially talked about the problem of the safe return of cosmic rockets to Earth. He said that in order to prevent the rocket from overheating when re-entering the atmosphere, it is necessary to prolong its descent time as much as possible. That is to say, before the rocket reaches the surface of the Earth, it should fly around the Earth several times. It should be taken into account here that in order to control the rocket's smooth landing in a predetermined area from the Earth, it is necessary to track its flight. Therefore, observation stations must be set up not only on land, but also at sea. Preliminary experience shows that it is very necessary to use ships for this purpose. With the further mastery of outer space, the significance of the world's oceans is also increasing. The ocean will not only be used to ensure the safe descent of each stage of the rocket with a parachute, so as to preserve the extremely valuable equipment that can be used for multiple tests, but also to ensure the automatic landing of the flight instruments returning from space navigation.

    苏联科学家谈向太平洋发射强大火箭结果
    人类向宇宙进军途中跨出新的一步
    新火箭十分准确、无线电联系不断、防热设备可靠
    新华社莫斯科22日电　塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院副院长托普切夫对塔斯社记者说，苏联多级弹道火箭发射到预定的太平洋地区，这是有计划地向宇宙进军的道路上的一个最重大的步骤。
    他又说，火箭飞行了约一万二千五百公里，它的降落点偏离预定降落点不到二公里，火箭发射的准确程度是难以想像的。
    托普切夫着重指出了火箭控制系统和火箭上的测量设备活动的高度准确性。他还指出，这种预定用于发射重型地球卫星和向太阳系行星作宇宙飞行的火箭，在起发时有着罕有的准确性。
    新华社莫斯科22日电　塔斯社消息：苏联科学家对于向太平洋区域发射强大弹道火箭的结果给予了极高的评价。
    苏联著名的火箭和人造卫星专家、苏联科学院学术秘书长费多罗夫教授说，这次发射是人类临近向距地球最近的行星作第一次飞行的新的重要阶段。
    乌克兰数学家格涅登科院士指出，火箭下落时所达到的惊人准确性以及火箭最后一级的模型在通过浓密大气层的运行情况，对于使火箭安全返回地球方面的工作来讲，具有极其重要的意义。
    苏联科学院物理技术研究所所长康斯坦丁诺夫教授指出，发射新的、更加强大的多级弹道火箭的成果至少在下列三个方面是惊人的。第一、火箭最后一级的模型的降落点偏离预定降落点一共仅为射程的六千分之一。第二、在火箭运行轨道的各点上，其中包括在降落地区的浓密大气层内，地球与火箭之间一直保持着无线电联系。第三、最后一级模型的防热设备是这样的可靠，以致完全防止了最后一级火箭的模型在大气低层高速运行时焚毁。
    苏联科学院通讯院士、数学家林尼克指出，用来操纵火箭飞行的调整计算设备的质量是非常高的。
    新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联发射成功了强大的多级火箭后，苏联科学家22日纷纷在苏联报纸上发表文章，谈论苏联新火箭的巨大科学意义。
    著名科学家多勃隆拉沃夫在“莫斯科真理报”上发表的文章指出，苏联在现代技术的一切主要方面，远远超过了一切其他国家。因此，苏联今年准备用火箭进行的研究宇宙的新工作，是在这方面已取得的成就的逻辑的、合乎规律的继续。苏联在掌握宇宙方面的成就是由同苏联科学技术力量总的繁荣有关的许多条件保证的。
    他说，这次火箭最后一级的模型的特点是，它在通过稠密的地球大气层时是不会烧掉的。这个特点对今后制造回到地球来的人造卫星具有重大意义。
    多勃隆拉沃夫说，新火箭虽然比苏联过去发射的宇宙火箭要大，但是，它的倒数第二级连同最后一级的模型一起，达到了每小时二万六千公里以上的速度，几乎等于第一宇宙速度（每小时二万九千公里）。这说明，未来更大的宇宙火箭的最后一级装上发动机后，不仅能获得第二宇宙速度（每秒十一点二公里），甚至还会超过这个速度，达到不只足以飞往月球，而且足以飞往太阳系行星的速度。
    多勃隆拉沃夫说，重型地球卫星的制造，对解决进一步发展行星际交通的问题是有好处的。往太阳系行星发射更重的宇宙火箭也有同样意义。在重型地球卫星上可以安装操纵系统来控制它在空中的方向。这种定向将有助于完成更有价值的科学研究。在重型地球卫星上甚至可以安装望远镜来摄取星空的照片。在重型地球卫星上还可以安装制动机。当卫星进入稠密的地球大气层时，制动机就可以对卫星刹车。最后，重型地球卫星上可以安装一个装置来保证卫星通过整个大气层，一直降落到地面。
    苏联数学家索波列夫在“真理报”上发表文章说，威力强大的多级弹道火箭试验成功，使科学家实现获取关于月球、火星和金星的充分资料这个理想的日期接近了。宇宙航行家的第一个任务将是利用这些天体来建造强大的研究宇宙的天文台。索波列夫预测：我们大概还能看到在月球和火星上建造天文台。
    技术科学副博士别列尔曼在“共青团真理报”上评价苏联新火箭的准确性时作了下列比较：这正像在十公里以外用步枪把一粒小弹丸击中一个苹果，子弹落在离苹果中心只有几毫米的地方。他还提到苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫的话，最近七年间自动火箭首先将研究月球周围的空间，然后飞到太阳系中离地球最近的行星。苏联人正在成功地解决这项宏伟的任务。
    在“共青团真理报”上发表另一篇文章的列宁格勒的天文学家、物理数学博士尼科诺夫也说，威力强大的宇宙实验船将飞向最近的行星，而强大的地球外部天文台将揭开研究天体的新的无上的可能性。
    瓦尔瓦罗夫在“苏联海军报”上评论苏联在火箭技术方面成功地进行的新的重大试验，他特别谈到了宇宙火箭安全回返地球的问题。他说，为了防止火箭在重新进入大气层时过度发热，必须尽可能延长它下降的时间。这就是说，在火箭达到地球表面以前，它应当围绕地球飞行几圈。这里应当考虑到，要从地球上控制火箭平稳地降落到预定地区，就必须跟踪它的飞行。因此，不仅在陆地上要设立观测站，在海洋上也要设立观测站。初步经验表明，为此而利用船只是非常必要的。随着宇宙空间的进一步被掌握，世界大洋水域的意义也越来越大。海洋不仅将用来保障火箭各级用降落伞安全下降，以保全可作多次试验用的极其珍贵的设备，而且也可以保证从宇宙航行回来的飞行仪器的自动降落。
