    Yellow Sand, Green Sea
    Chen Shu
    The sky is high and the clouds are light, the red sun hangs high. The car sped along the Wu-Min highway, which cuts straight through the desert, on the ancient Great Wall line leading to Minqin. Looking out from the car window, through the young and vigorous sand-break forests on the roadside, one can see the continuous Tengger Desert, like an ocean rolling with ten thousand yellow waves, extending to the distant horizon.
    Suddenly, in this silent desert, came the song broadcasted by the high-pitched loudspeaker. The car slowed down and stopped slowly. After I jumped out of the car, a magnificent picture immediately came into view: tens of thousands of labor troops were spread across the long dam; excavators, tractors, cars, horse-drawn carts, camel carts, frame carts, and handcarts shuttled back and forth. Ah! This is the green sea in the desert, the miracle created by the people of Minqin in Gansu, the famous Hongyashan Desert Reservoir in the Hexi Corridor! I ran a few steps and climbed onto the dam, wanting to take a good look at it.
    What appeared before my eyes? A green sea covering an area of about 40,000 mu, reflecting ten thousand colorful lights under the bright sunshine; in the distance, wild ducks fluttered into the water, splashing water like broken glass; the Shiyang River water, melted from the snow of the Qilian Mountains, was blocked head-on by the 8-kilometer-long dam, and after roaring and whirling, it obediently flowed into the Leap Forward Canal. In the canal, a few white sails floated, which were small wooden boat teams transporting materials. At the outlet of the reservoir, the towering hydroelectric station proudly overlooked the surrounding vast desert. To the northwest of the reservoir, the corner of a tile-roofed house was revealed, hidden in the shade of green trees, slogans, and flags, and the sound of hammers and motors mixed together could be vaguely heard - this is the new village of the reservoir.
    I went to the vicinity of the new village of the reservoir and found Secretary Li of the Party branch of the Second Construction Section. He was a middle-aged man with a dark complexion and a tall figure, holding a long whip, singing a song, and driving a camel cart, walking with a bounce; behind him was a long snake formation of carts.
    We walked, watched, and talked. Before our eyes was a boiling scene of labor, our ears were filled with laughter and songs, and the surroundings were a silent desert. I felt like I had entered a mythical kingdom. Just as I was thinking, Secretary Li started to speak:
    "To build a reservoir in the desert, let alone before liberation, even during the period of advanced cooperatives, it was just a beautiful fantasy. You don't know how many unimaginable difficulties there are in building a reservoir covering an area of more than 40,000 mu here!"
    He continued: Last year, as soon as the commune was established, the county party committee proposed the plan to build this reservoir. Of course, some people attacked it, saying, "This is nonsense!" But the masses of the communes selected representatives from all directions, carrying letters of guarantee and resolutions, to go to the county party committee to express their determination. After the construction started, people were full of energy. In the overwhelming wind and sand, in the piercing cold, everyone's hearts were filled with the breath of spring. Someone even composed a song, one section of which was: "The ground is frozen three feet, the heart is hot ten feet; the sky is the house, the earth is the bed; we must build the reservoir in the desert." This song immediately spread throughout the construction site and became everyone's common slogan for combat.
    Although everyone was very enthusiastic, the difficulties on the road ahead did not diminish at all. More than a month after the start of construction, we suddenly encountered a rare "good weather." The sun was hot and dry, making winter almost like summer. The young men excitedly threw off their cotton clothes and cheered to the sky, planning to have a good day's work; while the old men who had dealt with wind and sand for decades raised their heads and cast a very distrustful look at the clear sky. Sure enough, a turbid dark cloud appeared on the western horizon. It rushed and galloped, spreading out, and after a gloomy whistling wind, the sky was filled with yellow sand, which came down like a head-on blow, suddenly turning day into night, and making it impossible to distinguish east, west, north, and south. People collected their tools and hid in safe places. This fierce wind lasted all night. The next day, the wind had not subsided, and the turbid air had not cleared, but people ran out. What kind of scene appeared before their eyes! The built shacks were torn to pieces by the wind and sand, some were buried, and some were swept away; the dug-out reservoir foundations and the built dams were covered with scorched yellow sand ridges; even the Shiyang River changed its course, and the joyful river water turned into a sobbing trickle... It's over, everything is over! Forty-odd days of blood and sweat, and more than 200,000 workdays, were all blown away by the wind and sand.
    Just then, in the blurred distance, a few small black dots appeared. These black dots galloped quickly, breaking through the attack and blockade of the wind and sand, and rushed straight to the reservoir construction site. In an instant, seven or eight good men riding running camels stood in front of everyone. When everyone saw that it was Secretary Tang of the county party committee and leading comrades from relevant departments, they surrounded them like children who had been wronged, telling them about this unfortunate experience. Secretary Tang jumped off the running camel. He wore a lambskin hat, woolen blanket boots, and an old sheepskin coat, with a dark complexion and sharp eyes. He looked up at the vast sea of sand, and then looked at the migrant workers in front of him. After a moment of silence, he suddenly uttered a thunderous voice: "What we need is not complaining, but greater fighting spirit! Comrades, the sun has not left the desert, the brilliance of the general line still shines, wind, sand, and what else, our people's commune has enough strength to overcome them!"
    From that moment on, Secretary Tang set up a command post on the construction site, reorganized the organization, and arranged life. The shacks were replaced with earthen houses, trucks brought materials, and the "volunteers" reinforced by the communes, holding high the red flag of "Man will conquer nature," poured in from all directions like countless long dragons...
    "Now, the first and second phases of the project have been completed." Secretary Li continued to say to me, "We are constructing and utilizing at the same time. This year alone, we have blocked floods five times, irrigated 500,000 mu of land, and increased grain production by 28 million jin, equivalent to 46.66% of the total investment in the canal. Could this have been imagined before communization? During the construction process, we used self-reliance and indigenous methods to set up 37 factories for repair and manufacture, cement, lime, fire nitrate explosives, sand casting, etc., and cultivated more than 5,000 technical personnel from the original five iron and woodworking workers. Could this have been imagined before communization? We have developed diversified operations on the construction site, afforesting 20,000 mu, planting more than 800 mu of vegetables, and raising pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks. Fish are also raised in the reservoir. Could this have been imagined before communization? The project, which was originally planned to be completed in three and a half years, will be completed in a few more months at most, one and a half years ahead of schedule! Wooden boats are already passing through the completed Leap Forward Canal. Could this have been imagined before communization?..."
    My heart was burned by his fiery words. I thought, is this sun-drenched desert green sea an ordinary reservoir? No! Poets and singers from ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, have used countless passionate poems to praise a small drop of clear spring in the desert. Then, facing this 40,000-plus mu of desert green sea, how should we praise it?
    "Come and see again in March next spring," Secretary Li said with a hearty smile, "At that time, the sand-break forest belt built of peach, plum, apricot, date, and grape trellises will raise its soft branches to greet you; in the reservoir, you can see flocks of ducks, flocks of geese, and fishing boats; if you want to go to the county town, you can also take a small steamship... As for the future prospects, the migrant workers have already drawn them up: 'Grain and cotton piled up like mountains, orchards everywhere, the fragrance of rice flowers spreads for a hundred miles, and fish and ducks fill the ponds.'"
    I listened, unspeakably excited and moved. I kept responding: "I will definitely come then, definitely come!" August 1959

    黄沙绿海
    陈述
    天高云淡，红日当空。汽车在通往民勤的古长城线上，顺着直穿沙漠的武民公路飞驰。从车窗望出去，透过道旁幼小茁壮的防沙林，可以看见连绵起伏的腾格里大沙漠，好像滚着万道黄浪的海洋，一直漫延到遥远的天边。
    突然，在这寂静的沙漠中，传来高音喇叭广播的歌声。汽车开慢了，缓缓停下来。我跳下车后，一片雄伟的图景，立刻映入了眼帘：上万名劳动大军，布满长长的堤坝；挖土机、拖拉机、汽车、马车、骆驼车、架子车、手推车，往来如梭。呵！这就是沙漠中的绿海，甘肃民勤人民创造出的奇迹，河西走廊著名的红崖山沙漠水库了！我紧跑几步，登上堤坝，想好好地看一看它。
    我的眼前出现了什么呵？一个占地约四万亩大小的碧海，在灿烂的阳光照耀下，反射出万道彩光；远处野鸭扑楞楞投入水中，溅起碎玻璃似的水花；那由祁连山化雪汇成的石羊河水，被长达八公里的拦水大坝迎头一拦，咆哮回旋一番之后，便乖乖地流入跃进渠中。渠里，飘着几片白帆，那是运送材料的小木船队。水库出水口处，挺立的水电站，傲视着四周茫茫的沙漠。水库的西北面，在绿树、标语和旗帜的掩映中，露出瓦房的一角，隐约可以听见铁锤、马达揉混在一起的声音——这便是水库新村。
    我到水库新村近旁，找到第二工段党支部的李书记。他是一个脸膛黑黑，身材高大的中年汉子，手执长鞭，唱着歌儿，赶着骆驼车，一颠一晃走过来；他的后边，是一列车的长蛇阵。
    我们边走，边看，边谈。眼前是沸腾的劳动画面，满耳是笑语歌声，四外却是静穆的沙漠。我觉得，自己好像走进了神话的国度。正想着，李书记开了腔：
    “沙漠中修水库，不要说在解放前，就在高级社的时候，也只是一种美好的想像。你不知道，在这里修一个占地四万多亩的水库，有着多少作梦也梦不到的艰难呵！”
    他接着说了下去：去年，公社一成立，县委就提出修这座水库的计划。当然，有人攻击说：“这是瞎胡闹！”但各公社的群众却从四面八方，选了代表，抬着保证书和决心书，到县委去表决心。施工后，人们的干劲可足啦。在漫天的风沙中，在刺骨的严寒里，大伙儿的心上却充满了春天的气息。不知什么人还编出一首歌，其中有一段是：“地冻三尺，心热十丈；天空作房，大地作床；要把水库修建在沙漠上。”这歌立刻传遍全工地，成为大家战斗的共同口号。
    虽说大伙儿热情很高，但是，前进道路上的困难，还是一点没有减少。开工一个多月，忽然碰上一个稀有的“好天气”。太阳燥热，晒得冬季跟夏天差不多少。小伙子们兴奋的甩去棉衣，对天欢呼，打算美美地干一天；而那些跟风沙打过几十年交道的老人，却扬起头来，向万里晴空投去极不信任的眼光。果然，一块浑浊的乌云，出现在西方地平线上了。它急走飞驰，扩散开来，一股阴森的哨子风过后，漫天黄沙，便劈头盖脸压下来，白天突然变为黑夜，分不清东西南北。人们收了工具，躲入安全的地方。这场恶风连续了整整一夜。第二天，风还未退，浑浊的空气未清，人们就跑了出来。眼前出现了什么样的景象呵！那搭起的窝棚，被风沙扯的七零八落，有的被埋了，有的被卷得不知去向；已经挖过的库基和筑起的堤坝，压上焦黄的沙岭；连石羊河也改了道，欢腾的河水变为呜咽的细流……完了，一切全完了！四十多天的血汗，上二十万个劳动日，全被风沙吹光了。
    正在这当儿，在天地模糊的远方，出现了几个小小的黑点。这黑点飞快地奔驰着，突破风沙的袭击和封锁，直扑水库工地。瞬息间，七八个骑着跑驼的好汉，站在众人面前了。大伙儿一看是县委唐书记和有关部门的领导同志，就像受了委屈的孩子，一窝蜂似的围上去，诉说这不幸的遭遇。唐书记跳下了跑驼。他头戴羔皮帽，脚穿毛毯靴，身穿老羊皮皮袄，肤色焦黑，目光明锐。他举目望望这茫茫的沙海，又看看眼前的民工，沉默了一阵，忽然发出爆雷似的声音：“我们需要的不是诉苦，而是更大的斗志！同志们，太阳还没有离开沙漠，总路线的光辉依旧照耀，风呵，沙呵什么的，我们人民公社有足够的力量战胜它们！”
    从这时起，唐书记在工地扎下指挥部，整顿组织、安排生活。窝棚换成土房，汽车运来材料，各公社增援的“志愿军”，高举“人定胜天”的红旗，像无数条长龙，从四面八方涌来……
    “现在，第一、二期工程已经完工了。”李书记继续对我说，“我们边施工、边利用，光今年就拦洪五次，灌地五十万亩，增产粮食二千八百万斤，相当于渠道总投资的46．66％，这是公社化以前能够想像的吗？在施工过程中，我们用自力更生、因陋就简的办法，兴办了修理制造、水泥、白灰、火硝炸药、翻砂等三十七个工厂，由原来的五个铁木工培养出各种技术人员五千多名，这是公社化以前能够想像的吗？我们在工地上发展了多种经营，造林两万亩，种菜八百多亩，养了猪、羊、鸡、鸭，库内还养了鱼，这是公社化以前能够想像的吗？原计划三年半完成的工程，我们顶多再用几个月就完成了，提前一年半！在修成的跃进渠中，已经通行木船，这是公社化以前能够想像的吗？……”
    我的心被他这炽热的语言燃烧起来了。我想，这披满阳光的沙漠绿海，是一个普通的水库吗？不是！古今中外的诗人歌手，不知用多少激情的诗篇歌颂过沙漠中的一小滴清泉，那么，面对这四万多亩大的沙漠碧海，又该怎样赞颂？
    “明春3月时你再来瞧，”李书记爽朗的笑着说，“那时候，桃、李、杏、枣、葡萄架筑成的防沙林带，会扬起轻柔的枝条迎接你；在水库里，你可以看到鸭群、鹅群、渔船；你要愿意上县城去，还可以坐上小汽轮……。对于未来的远景，民工们早已描绘好了：‘粮棉堆成山，到处花果园，稻花百里香，鱼鸭满池塘’。”
    我听着，说不出的振奋激动。连连应着：“那时一定来，一定来！” 1959年8月
