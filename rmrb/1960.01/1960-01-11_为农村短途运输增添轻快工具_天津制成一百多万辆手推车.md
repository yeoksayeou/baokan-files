    Adding Light and Agile Tools for Short-Distance Rural Transportation
    Tianjin Produces Over One Million Handcarts
    (Our report) Tianjin's vehicle and cart factories have achieved remarkable success in rushing to produce handcarts to support rural water conservancy, chemical industry sites, and short-distance field transportation. The city has already produced 1,169,000 handcarts, and over 700,000 have already been transported to rural areas and reservoir construction sites.
    After accepting this task, all Tianjin factories adopted measures to strengthen leadership and organization for handcart production, viewing this task as a glorious mission to support agriculture. Tianjin Vehicle and Cart Industrial Company established a Handcart Office, and each factory also established a handcart production leading group headed by Party secretaries and other leaders to strengthen leadership over production. Factories helped each other and launched enthusiastic competition activities. The broad masses of workers tried every means to find shortcuts, engage in innovation, and improve production efficiency. In October of last year, the city produced more than 152,000 handcarts, and in November, it produced 300,000, an increase of nearly 100% compared to October. To support the rural realization of water conservancy and agricultural production, the Tianjin Vehicle Factory workers established a technical innovation headquarters, with everyone participating, attacking key problems. In the key workshop for completing the task—the single-wheel workshop—they achieved four major innovations, which doubled production efficiency. The First and Eighth Cart Factories adopted the method of organizing production experts to the front line to start competition, driving all factory workers to engage in technical innovation. The production experts of the First Cart Factory changed the manual spot welding machine to automatic ignition, which not only greatly reduced labor intensity but also increased labor efficiency by more than 30%. The production experts of the Eighth Cart Factory successfully trial-produced a set of iron-for-copper equipment for manufacturing iron spoke caps. After it was put into production in October, it produced 25,000 spoke caps per month, saving the country nine tons of copper material. The Second Cart Factory, which was engaged in mechanization and semi-mechanization on a large scale, also organized two technical innovation battles in the first half of November, achieving more than 1,100 innovation proposals. After the riveting operation in the assembly group was changed to automated production, production efficiency increased tenfold compared to the past.
    In the production process, leading cadres from all factories went to the front line of production in person, resolving problems encountered in production in a timely manner, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the workers. The city's task of producing handcarts in 1959 has exceeded the plan by 14.6%, an increase of two times compared to the total output in 1958.

    为农村短途运输增添轻快工具
    天津制成一百多万辆手推车
    本报讯　天津市各车辆、车具工厂的广大职工，在赶制手推车，支援农村水利化工地和田间短途运输方面，取得了显著成绩。全市已经生产出手推车一百一十六万九千辆，并已有七十多万辆运往农村和水库工地。
    天津市各厂在接受这项任务以后，都分别采取措施，加强手推车生产的领导和组织工作，把这项任务看成是支援农业的光荣任务。天津市车具工业公司成立了手推车办公室，各厂也都由党的书记等领导人员挂帅，成立了手推车生产领导小组，加强对生产的领导。各厂之间，一方面互助协作，同时展开了热烈的竞赛活动，广大职工千方百计地找窍门，搞革新，提高生产效率。去年10月份全市生产手推车十五万二千多辆，11月份就生产了三十万辆，比10月份增加将近一倍。天津车辆厂职工们为了支援农村实现水利化和支援农业生产，他们成立了技术革新指挥部，人人动手，猛攻关键，在完成任务的重点车间——单轮车间实现了四项重大革新，使生产效率成倍提高。第一、第八车具厂采用把生产能手组织到第一线，展开对手赛的方式，带动全厂职工，大搞技术革新。第一车具厂的生产能手们把手搬的对焊机改为自动打火以后，不仅大大减轻了劳动强度，而且使劳动效率提高30％以上。第八车具厂的生产能手们试制成功一套以铁代铜的制造铁条帽的设备，10月份投入生产以后，每月生产二万五千个车条条帽，为国家节约了九吨铜料。大搞机械化、半机械化的第二车具厂，在11月上半月还组织了两次技术革新战役，共实现了一千一百多项革新建议。仅装配组的砸碗改为自动化生产以后，生产效率就比过去提高了十倍。
    在生产过程中，各厂的领导干部都亲临生产第一线，及时地解决生产中所遇到的问题，大大鼓舞了职工群众的生产热情。全市1959年生产手推车的任务已经超额14．6％完成计划，比1958年全年产量增加了两倍。
