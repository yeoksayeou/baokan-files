Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: According to a report in today's "Akahata," the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) sent telegrams on January 20th to both the Japanese delegation with full powers, which signed the new US-Japan military alliance treaty in the United States, and to U.S. President Eisenhower, protesting the signing of the treaty by the governments of the United States and Japan.

In its protest telegram to the Japanese delegation, the Central Committee of the JCP stated that the Japanese delegation, led by Nobusuke Kishi, had disregarded the anger of the Japanese people and signed the new US-Japan "Security Treaty." The JCP lodged a serious protest and would fight to the end, together with the Japanese people, against the ratification of this treaty by the Japanese Diet.

In its telegram to Eisenhower, the JCP stated that together with the Japanese people, the JCP lodged a serious protest against the U.S. government's signing of the new "Security Treaty" with the Kishi government, which would escalate international tensions and infringe upon Japan's sovereignty and security. The JCP would fight to the end against the ratification and for the abolition of this treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: Tokyo dispatch: The Japan Socialist Party, at a leadership meeting held today, decided that the party would launch a vigorous struggle to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new US-Japan military alliance treaty.

At the meeting, the Socialist Party decided on its course of action for the next three months or so to oppose the new US-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security."

The course of action pointed out that the Japanese people's struggle against revising the "Security Treaty" had taken on a nationwide scale and was intensifying daily. On the other hand, within the Liberal Democratic Party, a situation of internal opposition had also emerged.

According to this course of action, the Socialist Party would focus on preventing the Diet from ratifying the new treaty, launching publicity and signature campaigns in various regions from February. In March, it would launch the 12th unified action, with people across the country holding large-scale marches and rallies against the US-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security." The plan also stipulated that in April, the 13th unified action would be launched, combining with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan's spring struggle to launch a vigorous movement against the new treaty.

The plan stipulated that in the Diet, the Socialist Party would demand that the government dissolve the Diet and hold a general election.

In its course of action, the Socialist Party called on people from all walks of life, including workers, youth, students, and women, to launch an even more massive struggle.

The Socialist Party leaders decided to submit this course of action to the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party for discussion and approval on the 26th.

Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: Tokyo dispatch: Prominent figures from all walks of life in Japan published statements in today's "Akahata," strongly protesting the Kishi government's act of national betrayal in signing a military alliance treaty with the United States.

Writer Tomoji Abe pointed out that Japan had launched many wars of aggression after forming the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy. We must learn from this lesson, force the Kishi government to step down, and prevent Japan from falling into the danger of destruction.

Kumaichi Yamamoto, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, pointed out that signing a treaty with several countries as hypothetical enemies at a time when international tensions were beginning to ease would exacerbate tensions. He called on the Japanese people to continue to work hard to abolish the new military alliance treaty.

Toyohiko Hori, a member of the Japan Christian Peace Association, pointed out that the Japanese people opposed revising the "Security Treaty." He stated that Christians would continue to launch movements to abolish the new "Security Treaty."

Ryosuke Honda, Vice-Chairman of the Japan Congress of Journalists, pointed out that the Japanese people's call for opposition to the signing of the new "Security Treaty" was growing louder and louder. After signing the new "Security Treaty" in the United States, the Kishi government blatantly stated that it would use the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act," etc., to intensify the suppression of the people. He said that in the future, we must launch a movement to crush this conspiracy.

Commentator Ayako Ishigaki said that as a cultural figure, I have an obligation to oppose this treaty. She said that she would do everything in her power to oppose this treaty.

Tsunekazu Ishiyama, the speaker of the Niigata Prefecture's Niitsu City Council, which recently passed a resolution opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty," said that the signing of the new "Security Treaty" was regrettable. He said that demanding peace and disarmament was the trend of the world, we must maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union and China, and absolutely oppose war.

The Japan PEN Club issued a statement saying that the Japanese delegation that signed the new "Security Treaty" in Washington did not represent the will and interests of the entire Japanese people.

The statement also pointed out that the delegation was endangering the country's future for the benefit of certain groups.

The statement said that, therefore, Japanese literary workers called on the people to rise up and defend their future, unite their ranks, and not allow the Diet to ratify this treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, January 20th: Tokyo dispatch: The Kishi government's action of signing the US-Japan military alliance treaty has aroused indignation and strong protests from the vast public in Japan.

The "Jurists' Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," composed of 1,500 lawyers, issued a statement today, announcing that the lawyers firmly opposed the Diet's ratification of the new US-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security."

The statement pointed out that the revised treaty openly violated the Japanese Constitution. Moreover, this treaty also made Japan an orphan in Asia.

The statement emphasized that according to the U.S. government's official interpretation of the revised treaty, Japan had neither the right to veto the deployment of U.S. troops stationed in Japan abroad nor the right to veto the transport of nuclear weapons into Japanese territory, and the United States did not have to seek Japan's consent on these issues.

The statement went on to say that, contrary to the government's propaganda, the right of veto was not even discussed during the negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty."

The statement said that the Japanese government's deceptive attitude was unacceptable and the Japanese people no longer trusted such a government.

The statement demanded that the Diet be dissolved before the Diet discussed the issue of ratifying this treaty, so that there would be an opportunity to consult public opinion on this issue.

The "Security Treaty Criticism Association," composed of writers, critics, and theatrical figures, issued a statement this afternoon, expressing strong opposition to this new treaty.

The statement pointed out that it could not be assumed that the delegation led by Nobusuke Kishi to sign the new treaty represented the will and interests of the Japanese people. The statement also pointed out that signing this treaty was detrimental to the future of the Japanese nation. The statement finally called on people from all walks of life to strengthen unity in order to prevent the Diet from ratifying this treaty.

Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, said in a statement this afternoon, "The Socialist Party will expose the war-like nature of the new treaty in the Diet in order to force the government to dissolve the Diet."

Munenji Okada, Director of the International Bureau of the Socialist Party, said: "Needless to say, this treaty is hostile to China and the Soviet Union." He said that this treaty had created new anxieties and threats in Asia.

The All-Japan Congress of Trade Unions, with more than 780,000 members, also issued a statement protesting the signing of the new treaty. This trade union demanded that the government dissolve the House of Representatives before the Diet deliberated on the ratification of the new treaty.
