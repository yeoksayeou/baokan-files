    Overcoming Difficulties and Continuously Leaping Forward
    As told by Hua Guoyu, Director of Shanghai Jindu Instrument Factory, recorded by Yao Chonghua
    To talk about the changes in our factory, we must start with the Great Leap Forward, and also mention our Xia Chuanxiang.
    The momentum of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 was truly strong! The targets of the brother instrument factories rose linearly, but we just couldn't catch up. Some people's minds were not liberated, and they always thought that the factory's foundation was too weak.
    The factory's foundation was indeed weak. It was only in 1956 that nine small handicraft cooperatives were merged, and at that time there were only more than forty people. In terms of equipment, there was not a single machine, and all operations were manual; in terms of technology, no one really understood technology. A few workers who had repaired clocks and watches were considered master craftsmen. Although the factory was small, there were many varieties, and the scope of cooperation was also very wide, supplying various instrument parts to more than eighty instrument factories in Shanghai and some other places. When everyone made a Great Leap Forward, they all came to our door to wait for goods. What to do? Should we ask the higher authorities for people? Not to mention that there were no people, even if people came, there would be no place to sit; should we ask for machines? We usually didn't dare to repair a broken screw on a small bed ourselves, so how could we ask for it? This was truly a case of the situation forcing people!
    The forcing matters continued behind. The instrument industry in the district held a "challenge stage" meeting. Several instrument factories challenged us, and we had to bite the bullet and accept the challenge, but we really had no confidence in our hearts. However, Xia Chuanxiang, he was the only young man in the factory who made bearing seats, only nineteen years old, but he couldn't get off the stage with another young man from the Yan'an Instrument Factory. He called out the daily output of bearing seats from five hundred to one thousand five, until he overwhelmed the opponent before he contentedly stepped down. Did he have confidence in his heart? Everyone else was sweating for him. But he silently started working.
    On the first day, he sharpened the drill bit and knife before going to work, and he couldn't even bear to take the time to go to the toilet. After sixteen hours of continuous hard work, he made one thousand two hundred. On the second day, it didn't work, and the output went down. Some people said sarcastically: "It still doesn't work, does it!" As if our small factory was destined to be poor, and you can't do it even if you risk your life. And Xia Chuanxiang, at this critical moment, had already made up his mind to find a way out on the bed. He understood that it was not enough to rely on physical strength alone, but also to work skillfully. At an on-site meeting, a large automatic lathe attracted him, so he used his brains to try to convert his hand lever bed into an automatic lathe.
    With something on his mind, his actions were a little "unconventional", which caused a not-so-small "disturbance". He went to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building to see the technical innovation "temple fair", and then made some small improvements on his hand lever lathe. Some people were dissatisfied and said that he affected production: "You can't even do production well, and you still want to do automation!" Some people said that he was too ambitious. He had been working for less than two years and was illiterate, and he still wanted to do innovation! Xia Chuanxiang was not to be outdone, and he said: "Innovation is not for myself, but for production."
    At this time, the branch, according to the instructions of the higher authorities to warmly support the workers' innovation, fully supported Xia Chuanxiang, allowing him to stop work for seven days and concentrate on innovation. We didn't have any technical personnel, so we invited a few master craftsmen to help him. Xia Chuanxiang was also very moved. After hard work, an automatic bearing seat lathe was finally born. Although, at first, the efficiency of that automatic lathe was not high, and the quality of the product was also poor. However, it was not a simple matter for a nineteen-year-old young man who had not gone to school to create an automatic lathe.
    At this time, the Party general branch gave a high evaluation, and he also asked us if we could realize the automation of the whole factory in three months or half a year? Under the inspiration of the Party, the enthusiasm of all the workers and staff of the factory was even higher, and they all expressed their willingness to realize new targets in the shortest possible time.
    Everyone moved their bedding to the factory. They did production during the day and innovation at night; they lay down when they were sleepy and started working when they woke up. Of course, there were many difficulties. Without materials, the company and brother factories gave some, and we also collected a lot of old materials and scraps ourselves. Without equipment, we asked brother factories in Wuxi, Hangzhou and other places for some vices and machine parts; during the gaps when brother factories did not produce at night, we borrowed lathes to use, and one production run lasted all night. Everyone didn't know how to use the beds, so they learned from others. If they couldn't draw, the workers drew on the ground and on the stage with chalk based on their own operating experience and impressions from visits. Three members of the Communist Youth League, Xu Dunyu, Dong Yuanquan, and Shao Jinfeng, who were workers making bread and sweets three months ago, had never even touched a machine, but they also broke the superstition and cooperated in designing and manufacturing an automatic slot milling lathe.
    In this year, our factory manufactured a total of twenty-seven automated and semi-automated equipment of various sizes, and improved forty-seven operating tools. Although the automation of the whole factory was not realized, it had already taken a big step forward.
    1959 was a year of even greater leap forward. Everyone was not frightened by the tasks that had increased exponentially. On the contrary, from the beginning of the year, everyone was excited to produce more and better instrument parts for the country. We had tense production during the day, and "night markets" for technical innovation in groups of three or five at night. Xia Chuanxiang was still the "locomotive" in the technical revolution. In order to solve the problem of the output of the heart of the instrument—the shaft tip—he made seven material tests on the polishing grinding wheel of the combined shaft tip car, failed more than forty times, and finally found the reason for the failure. The factory did not have a grinding machine, and there were difficulties in grinding, so he used a lathe instead of a grinding machine, fighting hard for four days and four nights, and after more than ten times of disassembly and assembly, he finally solved this key. The bearing seat lathe, which was originally ridiculed as "automation is not as good as no automation", has been greatly improved four times by him, and has been transformed from native to foreign. One person can now watch six machines, and the output has increased eighteen times compared to manual operation, and the scrap rate has also dropped from 40% to 5%. He is still making the fifth improvement.
    In order to strengthen the organization and leadership of the technical revolution. The whole factory established a core group, and each production group also had a core. At the same time, the masses were mobilized to carry out innovation, so that the professional groups were combined with the masses; and that large, medium and small were combined. Wherever the key to production was, we would concentrate our efforts to encircle and suppress it, so that production and technical revolution were combined.
    Under the guidance of the Party, we have finally found a way to realize the automation of production: self-reliance is the main thing, from low-level to high-level, from native to foreign, constantly improving, and constantly improving. In 1959, the whole factory produced thirty-three automatic lathes and semi-automatic lathes, and improved one hundred and seven operating tools. All automatic lathes, semi-automatic lathes, and most mechanical lathes were manufactured by ourselves. In this year, the output value increased by more than two times, achieving that one person could top three people, and the cost was reduced by 40%. The level of automation has also been greatly improved. Not only has the automatic lathe itself been significantly improved, but also the main parts and basic processes such as bearing seats, nuts, screws, tapping, slot milling, and quenching have automatic equipment, and the production appearance has been completely changed.
    In the brilliant achievements of the motherland's rapid development, our work is only a drop of water in the ocean; but this drop of water also reflects the brilliance of the general line, reflecting the urgent desire and strong will of the Chinese working class under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao to completely change the situation of "poverty and blankness". In 1960, we will advance from single-machine automation to the establishment of automatic production lines. There will be difficulties. But behind the difficulties is the Great Leap Forward. By overcoming great difficulties, we can realize the Great Leap Forward!

    克服困难  不断跃进
    上海金都仪表厂厂长　华国裕口述　姚重华记
    要说我们工厂的变化，就要从大跃进说起，也要说到我们的夏川祥。
    1958年的大跃进来势可真猛！兄弟仪表厂的指标直线上升了，可是我们却怎么也上不去。有人思想没解放，总认为是工厂底子太薄。
    工厂的底子确实也薄。1956年才由九个小手工业社合并起来，当时只有四十多人。论设备，没有一台机器，都是手工操作；论技术，没有一个人真正懂得技术。几个修理过钟表的工人，就算是老师傅。厂子虽小，可是品种不少，协作面也很广，要供应上海八十多家和外地一些仪表厂各种仪表零件。大家一跃进，都上门等货来了。怎么办？向上级要人吗？别说没有人，即使来了人也没有地方坐；要机器吗？平日小床子上坏了个螺丝自己都不敢动手修，怎么说得出口呢？这才真叫形势逼人！
    逼人的事情还在后面。区里的仪表行业开了个“打擂台”大会，几个仪表厂向我们提出挑战，我们也只好硬着头皮应战，心里可真没有底。但是，夏川祥，他是厂里唯一做轴座的小伙子，才十九岁，却和延安仪表厂的另一个小伙子打擂台打得下不来了。他把轴座的日产量从五百一直叫到一千五，直到压倒了对方才称心地走了下来。他心里有底吗？别人都替他捏一把汗。可是他却一声不响地干起来了。
    第一天，他在上班前就把钻头、刀子磨好，开了车，连上厕所的时间都舍不得。连续苦战了十六个钟头，干了一千二。第二天，不行了，产量下去了。有人冷言冷语：“还是不行吧！”好像我们小厂注定了命穷，你拼了小命也不行。而夏川祥，就在这个关头已经下了决心，要在床子上找出路。他懂得，光凭体力不行，还得巧干。在一次现场会议上，一台大型自动车床吸引了他，于是就开动了脑筋想把自己的手扳床子改成自动车床。
    心里有事，行动就有点出“常规”，这就引起了一场不小的“风波”。他一下到中苏友好大厦去看技术革新“庙会”，一下又在自己的手扳车床上搞点小改进。有人就不满意，说他影响了生产：“生产都搞不好，还要搞自动化！”有人说他好高骛远，不到两年工龄，又是个文盲，还想搞革新！夏川祥可也不示弱，他说：“搞革新，不是为自己，是为了生产。”
    这时候，支部根据上级热情支持工人的革新的指示，全力支持夏川祥，让他停七天工，专心搞革新。我们没有技术人员，就请了几位老师傅帮着他。夏川祥也很感动，经过苦战，一台自动轴座车床终于出世了。虽然，一开始那台自动车床的效率不高，产品质量也差些。可是，一个十九岁的小伙子没有念过书，却搞出了一台自动车床，这不是一件简单的事。
    这时，党总支给了很高的评价，他并且问我们能不能在三个月或半年内实现全厂自动化？全厂职工在党的启示下，干劲更高涨，纷纷表示在最短时间内实现新的指标。
    大家都把铺盖搬到厂里来了。白天搞生产，晚上搞革新；困了一躺，醒了就动手。碰到的困难当然很多。没有材料，公司和兄弟厂给一些，我们自己也收集了不少旧料、边料。没有设备，就向无锡、杭州等地的兄弟厂要些虎钳和机件；在兄弟厂晚上不生产的空档，借了车床用，一生产就是一个通宵。大家不会上床子，就向别人学。不会画图，工人凭自己的操作经验和参观的印象，用粉笔在地上、台上自己画。三个共青团员徐敦余、董元泉、邵金凤，三个月前还是做面包糖果的工人，连机器都没有碰过，也破除了迷信，合作设计制造了一台自动铣槽车床。
    这一年，我们工厂共制造了大大小小二十七台自动化、半自动化设备，改进了四十七种操作工具。虽然没有实现全厂自动化，可是已经迈进了一大步。
    1959年是更大跃进的一年。大家没有被成倍增长的任务吓住，相反地，从年初开始，大家就为要替国家生产更多更好的仪表零件而欢欣鼓舞。我们白天是紧张的生产，晚上是三五成群搞技术革新的“夜市”。夏川祥仍旧是技术革命中的“火车头”。他为了解决仪表的心脏——轴尖的产量问题，对联合轴尖车的抛光磨轮作了七种材料试验，失败了四十多次，终于找到了失败的原因。厂里没有磨床，研磨有困难，他就用车床代磨床，奋战四昼夜，经过十多次拆装，终于解决了这个关键。原来被人讽刺为“自动化不如不动化”的轴座车床，经过他四次大改进，已经从土到洋，一个人可以看六台了，产量比手工操作提高十八倍，废品率也从40％降低到5％。现在还在作第五次改进。
    我们为了加强对技术革命的组织领导。全厂成立了核心小组，每个生产小组也有了核心。同时发动群众搞革新，使专业组和群众相结合；使大中小结合。什么地方是生产中的关键，就全力围攻，使生产和技术革命相结合。
    在党的引导下，我们终于找到了一条实现生产自动化的道路：自力更生为主，从低级到高级，从土到洋，不断改进，不断提高。1959年，全厂造出了自动车床、半自动车床三十三台，改进了操作工具一百零七项，全部自动车床、半自动车床和绝大部分机械车床都是自己制造的。这一年，产值增长了两倍多，做到了一个人顶三个人，成本降低了40％。自动化的水平也有了很大提高。不仅自动车床本身有了显著的改进，而且轴座、螺帽、螺丝、攻丝、铣槽、淬火等主要零件和基本工序都有了自动设备，生产面貌有了彻底改变。
    在祖国飞跃发展的辉煌成就中，我们的工作只不过是大海中的一滴水；但是这一滴水也反映了总路线的光芒，反映了在党和毛主席领导下的中国工人阶级要彻底改变“一穷二白”的迫切愿望和坚强毅力。1960年，我们要在单机自动化的基础上，向建立自动生产线进军。困难是会有的。可是困难后面是跃进，克服了大困难，我们就能实现大跃进！
