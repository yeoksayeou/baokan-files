Xinhua News Agency, 6th -- Beijing Electronic Tube Factory adopts various forms to run spare-time middle-level technical study classes, accelerating the cultivation of middle-level technical personnel.

The factory currently has three forms of spare-time middle-level technical study classes: the Beijing Radio School night school, which is run on behalf of the Beijing Radio School; a study class attached to the factory's staff and workers' spare-time cultural school; and a study class jointly run by the factory's staff and workers' spare-time school and Branch Factory No. 1 and Branch Factory No. 6. More than 460 students are participating. These students are all skilled workers and apprentices with a junior middle school education and are relatively advanced in their thinking, production labor, and learning. The three types of study classes are all equipped with specialties such as vacuum electronics and mechanical manufacturing, according to the production needs of the electronic tube factory, and plan to learn the curriculum of full-time equivalent middle-level technical majors in four and a half years. The night school established by the Beijing Radio School was established in 1956 and now has fourth-year students. The middle-level technical study classes run within the factory were all established in the autumn of 1958.

The curriculum of the study classes is closely integrated with production practice. While learning, they play a role in production. Twenty-three of the thirty-seven fourth-year students of the Beijing Radio School night school have become advanced producers in the electronic tube factory. Student Liu Sili put forward more than 50 technical innovation suggestions in one year. After she and Xu Zhanzhen and others studied the four-bar linkage law of physics, they improved the short-circuit automatic testing equipment, which improved the quality of work. She was selected to attend the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference in 1958. After a year of study, the students of the factory-run spare-time middle-level technical study class have learned to make relatively complex drawings, and their operating level has also improved. Some workers are now able to draw their own drawings in technical innovations.

These study classes generally have 12 hours of classes per week. The study classes run by the branch factories study less when they are busy and more when they are idle, which is more flexible. The teachers highlight the key points in their lectures, strengthen questioning and tutoring, so that the students can digest what they have learned in class on the spot. The study classes have also established a set of organizational leadership systems for attendance, rewards and punishments, grade evaluation, leave of absence, handling admission, suspension, and withdrawal procedures, etc., to strengthen the management of learning and ensure the normal order of learning. The factory-run study classes arrange the curriculum according to the factory's production situation and the workers' actual knowledge, on the premise of not affecting the systematicness of the course content, and the teaching progress is also flexibly adjusted according to the factory's production rhythm. These are all welcomed by the workers, and the attendance rate has remained above 80%.

    北京电子管厂采用多种形式举办业余学习班
    从工人中培养中等技术人材
    新华社6日讯　北京电子管厂采用多种形式举办业余中等技术学习班，加速培养中等技术人材。
    这个厂现在有三种形式的业余中等技术学习班：北京无线电学校代设的北京无线电学校夜校，附设在本厂职工业余文化学校内的学习班，由本厂职工业余学校和一分厂、六分厂联合举办的学习班。参加的学员共有四百六十多人。这些学员都是具有初中文化程度，思想、生产劳动和学习比较先进的技术工人和徒工。三种学习班都按照电子管厂生产上的需要设有电真空、机械制造等专业，计划在四年半时间内学会全日制同等中等技术专业的课程。北京无线电学校代设的夜校，1956年成立，现在已有四年级学生。厂内办的中等技术学习班都是在1958年秋天成立的。
    学习班的课程同生产实际密切结合，一边学习，一边在生产上发挥作用。北京无线电学校夜校四年级的三十七名学员，有二十三人成了电子管厂的先进生产者。学员刘思立在一年内提出了五十多项技术革新建议，她和徐占珍等学习物理学四杆定律后，改进了短断路自动化试验设备，提高了工作质量。她在1958年曾被选出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。厂校业余中等技术学习班的学员经过一年的学习，已经会制比较复杂的图象，操作水平也提高了。有些工人在技术革新中已能自己画图了。
    这些学习班每周一般上课十二小时，分厂办的学习班忙时少学，闲时多学，比较灵活。教师们在讲课中突出重点，加强提问和辅导，使学员当堂所学，当堂消化。学习班还建立有考勤、奖惩、成绩评定、请假、办理入学、休学、退学手续等一套组织领导制度，加强学习的管理，保证了学习的正常秩序。工厂自办的学习班，在不影响课程内容系统性的前提下，按照厂内生产情况和工人的实际知识安排课程，教学进度也根据厂内生产节奏灵活调整。这些都受到工人的欢迎，出席率一直保持在80％以上。
