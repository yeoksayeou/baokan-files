Steel and coal, grain and cotton, four little babies, standing side by side, mouths open, smiling.
Calling out, "Hello, Auntie, come and see:
Have we grown tall? Are we growing well?"
Auntie claps and smiles, "Baby has grown taller!"
Each one is fat and plump, everyone praises!
Six hundred million nursery workers, taking care so attentively,
The babies are growing fast, they deserve the credit!

    苗地画　陈涛诗钢煤和粮棉，四个小宝宝，并排站一起，张着嘴儿笑。叫声好阿姨，你来瞧一瞧：长得高不高？长得好不好？阿姨鼓掌笑，宝宝长高了！个个肥又胖，人人都叫好！六亿保育员，照看真周到，宝宝长得快，他们有功劳！
