Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: Soviet soprano Ye. Melroshnichenko held her first solo concert in China tonight at the auditorium of the National Culture Palace. Her beautiful, high-pitched, and mellow voice brought great artistic enjoyment to the capital's audience, who are celebrating the Spring Festival.

This singer, who won second place in the 1958 French Toulouse International Singing Competition, performed fifteen wonderful programs tonight, including Konstanze's aria from the opera "The Abduction from the Seraglio," "In the Distance," and "How Beautiful It Is Here," with piano accompaniment by Luo. Yelvova, a lecturer in the Vocal Music Department of the Kiev Conservatory. Ye. Melroshnichenko is an excellent coloratura soprano. Her singing is poetic, and her voice is undulating. The high and low transitions are very natural, flowing like a clear spring gushing from the mountains, and mellow like an oriole singing in the forest. Tonight, after she finished the scheduled twelve programs, she added three more programs, including "Nightingale" and "Ancient Romance," to the enthusiastic applause of the audience.

Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the concert. Also present were Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries; Ge Baoquan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Zhao Feng, Vice President of the Central Conservatory of Music; and figures from the capital's music circles. During the intermission, Vice Premier Chen Yi met with Ye. Melroshnichenko and Luo. Yelvova, and after the entire performance, he went on stage to congratulate them on the success of the performance.
