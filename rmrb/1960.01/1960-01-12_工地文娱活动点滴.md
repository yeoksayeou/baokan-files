    Snippets of Cultural and Recreational Activities on Construction Sites
    * On the 60-li-long construction site of the Xiashan Reservoir in Changwei Prefecture, Shandong Province, poems and paintings fill the eye, songs resound across the land, and red flags flutter in a scene of boundless vitality. The migrant workers of this reservoir wrote inspiring lines of poetry: We are heroic men standing tall between heaven and earth, daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act! With a punch, Xiashan is pierced through; with a flick of the toe, the Wei River turns its course.
    * At the Niukouyu Reservoir construction site in the Zhoukoudian area of Beijing, about 1,900 people participate in cultural and recreational activities, accounting for one-third of the total number of workers on the site.
    * In twenty days, the masses at the Xipu Reservoir construction site in Pan County, Guizhou Province, created more than 1,200 folk songs and 80 plays.
    In addition, there are no fewer than dozens of forms of entertainment such as exhibitions, broadcasts, water conservancy newsletters, blackboards, big-character posters, honor rolls, martial arts platforms, poetry contests, and various small-scale artistic performances. They play a great role in educating the masses.
    * Six cultural centers, eighty-nine cultural stations, more than three hundred clubs, and thirty-six amateur theatrical troupes have been established on the eight medium-sized reservoir construction sites in Biyang County, Henan Province.

    工地文娱活动点滴
    ＊山东省昌潍专区的峡山水库六十里长的工地上，诗画满目，歌声遍野，红旗招展，气象万千。这个水库的民工写出激动人心的诗句：我们是顶天立地的英雄汉，敢想、敢说、敢干！拳头一伸，峡山穿洞，脚指一动，潍河拐弯。
    ＊北京市周口店区的牛口峪水库工地参加文娱活动的群众约一千九百人，占工地总人数的三分之一。
    ＊贵州省盘县西铺水库工地的群众，在二十天内创作民歌一千二百余首，剧本八十个。
    另外还有展览、广播、水利小报、黑板报、大字报、光荣榜、比武台、赛诗会，以及各种小型文艺演唱等不下数十种。对教育群众起着很大的作用。
    ＊河南省泌阳县的八个中型水库工地建立了六个文化馆，八十九个文化站，三百多个俱乐部，三十六个业余剧团。
