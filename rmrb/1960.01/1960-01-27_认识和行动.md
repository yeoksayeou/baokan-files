    Understanding and Action
    Shu Jia
    Regarding the relationship of mutual dependence and mutual promotion among agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, the vast number of rural cadres and members have become increasingly aware of this in practice. However, whether agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry can develop simultaneously, especially whether they can achieve a significant development at the same time, is a question that a few people have not yet resolved. Now, Yushan County in Jiangxi Province has provided a strong affirmative answer based on the facts of the past year.

    Let's look at Yushan County's answer:

    Animal Husbandry: Currently, the number of pigs in Yushan County has increased from over 100,000 after the summer harvest last year to 350,000, reaching one pig per mu of land; there are over 800,000 chickens, ducks, and geese, an increase of 50% compared to 1958, and cattle and sheep have increased by 40%.

    Agriculture: Due to the increase in livestock and fertilizer, the unit area yield of grain in the county last year increased by 40% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and the total output increased by 20%, transforming the county from a historically grain-deficient area to a grain-surplus area.

    Forestry: Last year, the county afforested 140,000 mu of land, and timber production increased by two times compared to 1958, initially controlling soil erosion and opening up vast pastures for animal husbandry.

    Why was Yushan County able to achieve such great development and such great achievements in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in such a short period of just over a year? The main reason is that the Yushan County Party Committee not only recognized the relationship of mutual dependence and mutual promotion among agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, but also saw the objective conditions for developing agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production, especially the favorable conditions brought about by the people's commune, a social organization with powerful vitality and unparalleled superiority characterized by "large size and high degree of public ownership." Therefore, they had a soaring drive and fully utilized the advantages of the people's commune, which has a large organizational scale, a wide range of activities, and can implement unified planning and comprehensive production arrangements, vigorously promoting the simultaneous development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. According to the specific conditions of Yushan County, to solve the problem of grain shortage, it is first necessary to have a greater development in agricultural production. There are various ways to develop agricultural production at a high speed, and the specific situation in Yushan County is a shortage of fertilizer, labor, and funds. In order to solve the problems of fertilizer and funds for agriculture, they seized animal husbandry production centered on pig raising, using the development of animal husbandry to provide fertilizer, labor, and funds for agriculture, thereby promoting the development of agriculture. At the same time, they vigorously developed forestry to promote agriculture through forestry and support animal husbandry through forestry. On the basis of developing forestry and animal husbandry, they took grain as the key link, comprehensively developed agriculture, promoted animal husbandry through agriculture, and promoted forestry through agriculture.

    The situation in Yushan County shows that to promote the simultaneous development and common improvement of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, it is necessary not only to correctly understand the mutually dependent and mutually promoting relationship among the three, but also to start from the specific conditions of the locality, fully utilize the superiority of the people's commune, and seize the central link that promotes the simultaneous development of the three industries in order to achieve the beautiful aspiration of thriving livestock, abundant harvests, and lush forests.

    认识和行动
    蜀嘉
    对于农、林、牧三业互相依存、互相促进的关系，广大农村干部和社员在实践中越来越清楚地认识了。但是，农、林、牧三业能不能同时发展，尤其是能不能同时来一个很大的发展，少数人还没有解决这个问题。现在，江西玉山县用一年来的事实作了有力的肯定的回答。
    请看玉山县的答案：
    畜牧业：目前，玉山县的猪已由去年夏收后的十多万头发展到三十五万头，达到了每亩田一头猪；鸡鸭鹅有八十多万只，比1958年增长50％，牛羊增长40％。
    农业：由于牲畜多、肥料多，全县去年的粮食单位面积产量比大跃进的1958年增加40％，总产量增加20％，由历史上的缺粮县一跃而为余粮县。
    林业：去年全县造林面积达十四万亩，木材产量比1958年增加二倍，初步控制了水土流失，为牧业开辟了广阔的放牧场。
    为什么玉山县能够在短短一年多的时间，就使全县的农、林、牧业得到了这样大的发展，取得了这样大的成绩？主要是玉山县委不但认识到了农、林、牧三业互相依存、互相促进的关系，而且看到了发展农、林、牧业生产的客观条件，特别是人民公社这个“一大二公”具有强大生命力和无比优越性的社会组织所带来的有利条件。因此，他们有一股冲天的干劲，充分发挥了人民公社组织规模大、活动范围广、可以统一规划、全面安排生产的优越性，大力促进农、林、牧三业一齐发展。根据玉山县的具体情况来看，要解决缺粮问题，首先必须使农业生产有一个更大的发展。高速度发展农业生产可以有各种方法，玉山县的具体情况是缺少肥料、劳力和资金。为了解决农业的肥料、资金等问题，他们抓住了以养猪为中心的畜牧业生产，以畜牧业的发展为农业提供肥料、劳力和资金，促进农业的发展。同时，大力发展林业，以林促农，以林养牧。在发展林牧业的基础上，以粮为纲，全面发展农业，以农促牧，以农带林。
    玉山县的情况说明，要促使农、林、牧三业一齐发展、共同提高，不但要正确地认识三者互相依存、互相促进的关系，而且要从本地的具体条件出发，充分运用人民公社的优越性，抓住促使三业齐发展的中心环节，才能达到六畜兴旺、五谷丰登、林木茂盛的美好愿望。
