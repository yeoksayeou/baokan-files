    (Our report) Local small and medium-sized petroleum enterprises are developing rapidly across the country. As of now, all but a few of the twenty-eight provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in the country have established petroleum industries, creating conditions for gradually changing the uneven distribution of petroleum production in our country and meeting the growing needs of industry and agriculture for petroleum.
    The vast majority of local small and medium-sized petroleum enterprises were developed from scratch and grew from small to large during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In the past year or so, the total production capacity of local small and medium-sized petroleum industries nationwide has reached a level of about 400,000 tons of crude oil per year, and last year's total crude oil production was four times higher than in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. There has also been great development in the processing and comprehensive utilization of crude oil. At present, these small and medium-sized petroleum enterprises can produce gasoline, diesel, kerosene, asphalt, phenols, and some industrial lubricating oils and greases.
    The development of local petroleum industries over the past year or so has proved that vigorously launching mass movements is an indispensable and important aspect of increasing crude oil production at high speed. The development of small oil refineries has made full use of decentralized refining raw materials, and at the same time, many new petroleum resources have been discovered. Many places have not only extracted oil from coal and shale, but also from peat, pine branches, pine roots, and oil tea seed cake. The Xuecheng Coking Plant in Shandong province uses coal slurry and water slag left over from coal washing to distill oil; Gansu province has created a new type of heat-collecting distillation furnace, which has further expanded the source of raw materials for distillation and oil refining.
    The experience of the development of local petroleum industries has proved that vigorously promoting comprehensive utilization and combining the oil refining industry with the indigenous coking industry to produce both coke and extract oil is an important way to develop local petroleum production. Its advantages are that the raw materials are readily available, not much equipment is needed, the technology is not complicated, and the results are quickly achieved. The Xuecheng No. 1 Coking Plant in Shandong province uses mechanical overall oil extraction, with an oil recovery rate of 1%-1.5%. The Maoershan Coal Mine Coking Plant in Fushun County, Sichuan province, has an oil recovery rate as high as 4%. This not only increases oil production but also reduces coke costs. At the same time, the recovery of coal tar can shorten the coking time of coal, reduce the volatile content of coke, and improve the quality of coke. In the process of carrying out comprehensive utilization, many small refineries have also come up with many ways to use by-product gas as fuel for diesel engines and brick and tile kilns, and to use waste water from oil refining for fertilizing fields and killing insects, expanding the use of coal and increasing income. At present, most of the small and medium-sized refineries in various places have broken through technical barriers, and many factories have gone from not understanding the technology to being able to produce large quantities of coal tar and carry out processing and fractionation.

    挖掘分散资源潜力　大搞炼油综合利用
    各省区发展中小石油企业
    年产原油能力达到四十万吨　去年产量比前年增长四倍
    本报讯　各地地方中、小型石油企业正在迅速发展。截至目前，全国二十八个省、市、自治区，除个别地区外，都办起了石油工业，为逐步改变我国石油生产的分布不匀的状况，及满足工农业对石油日益增长的需要创造了条件。
    地方中、小型石油企业，绝大部分都是在1958年大跃进中，从无到有，从小到大地发展起来的。一年多以来，全国地方中、小型石油工业的总生产能力已经达到年产四十万吨左右原油的水平，去年原油总产量比大跃进的1958年高出四倍。原油的加工与综合利用方面，也有了很大的发展。目前，这些中、小型石油企业已能生产出汽油、柴油、煤油、沥青、酚类以及一些工业用的润滑油脂。
    一年多来地方石油工业的发展，证明了大搞群众运动，是高速度增产原油不可缺少的重要方面。小型油厂的发展使分散的炼油原料得到了充分利用，同时还发现了许多新的石油资源。不少的地方不仅用煤炭、页岩炼出了石油，而且用草炭、松枝、松根、油茶枯炼出了原油。山东薛城炼焦厂用洗煤后剩下的煤泥和水渣干馏石油；甘肃创造新式的集热式干馏炉，更扩大了干馏炼油的原料来源。
    地方石油工业发展的经验证明，大搞综合利用，把炼油工业和土法炼焦工业结合起来，既炼焦又取油，是发展地方石油工业生产的重要途径。它的好处是原料现成，设备需要不多，技术不复杂，收效却很快。山东薛城第一焦化厂采用机械总体抽油，收油率达到1％—1．5％。四川富顺县猫儿山煤矿焦厂收油率高达4％。这样，既增产了石油，又降低焦炭成本。同时，由于回收了焦油，还可以缩短煤炭焦化的时间，减少焦炭挥发份，提高焦炭质量。在开展综合利用过程中，许多小型炼油厂还想出了许多办法利用副产的煤气作柴油机及砖瓦窑的燃料，用炼油的废弃污水肥田、杀虫等，扩大了煤的用途，也增加了收入。目前，各地中、小型炼油厂大都已突破技术关，许多工厂由不懂技术到能生产出大量焦油，并能进行加工分馏等工作。
