Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th. Shanghai Machine Tool Plant workers improved the heart of the precision grinder—the hydraulic transmission control box—reducing the parts of the control box from thirty-three to twelve, shortening the processing time from twenty-three hours and fifty minutes to thirteen hours and thirteen minutes, and reducing the weight from twenty-three kilograms to fourteen kilograms. These innovations have taken China's new hydraulic transmission technology a step forward.

The hydraulic transmission control box is the central hub on the precision grinder, divided into a control box and a feed box. The first time the workers of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant improved the hydraulic transmission control box was during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Wu Delun, a seventh-grade assembler and Communist Party member, decided to start with improving the design to accelerate the production of the control box, and designed dozens of drawings. At the time, some people said that this was "digging for dirt on the head of 'Tai Sui'" (akin to "kicking against the pricks"). However, Wu Delun's plan for innovative design received strong support from the Party branch. The factory assigned technicians to draw detailed part drawings and assembly drawings based on Wu Delun's sketches, and notified all departments to process the parts for the new control box as soon as they arrived. As a result, the control box designed by Wu Delun was successfully tested in just one week.

In the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959, Wang Weidao, a second-grade worker who had just completed his apprenticeship, improved the design of the control box once again, reducing the number of parts by three, reducing the weight by another two kilograms, and improving the quality. This inspired Wu Xingzhong, Wang Weidao's master, with enthusiasm for innovation. He worked hard for several days and drew a sketch of the feed box. After many failures, he finally succeeded. The parts of the feed box were reduced from sixteen to seven, and the performance was also better.

However, Wu Xingzhong was not satisfied with this. He felt that the improved feed box was still relatively large, and he planned to merge the remaining two shafts together. In the process of designing the sketch, he encountered a difficulty: the calculation of pressure balance. He brought this problem to the Yulin District Amateur Higher Industrial School where he was studying, and with the help of the theoretical mechanics teacher, this difficulty was also overcome.

At this time, Chen Weimin, another apprentice of Wu Xingzhong who had already completed his apprenticeship, found that one shaft in the control box and the feed box was similar, so he boldly changed the shaft from a moving type to a rotating type, making the new design more perfect. In this way, the new control box was born on the first working day of this year.

The achievements of the four innovations have made the workers deeply understand that technical innovation is endless. Now they are making new plans and pondering new designs.

### 技术革新无止境高峰上面有高峰  四勇士四改机床“心脏”  上海机床厂工人吴德伦、王伟道、邬兴中、陈伟民创造出新型操纵箱

    技术革新无止境高峰上面有高峰
    四勇士四改机床“心脏”
    上海机床厂工人吴德伦、王伟道、邬兴中、陈伟民创造出新型操纵箱
    据新华社上海19日电　上海机床厂工人改进精密磨床的心脏部分——液压传动操纵箱，使操纵箱的零件从三十三个减少到十二个，加工工时从二十三小时五十分缩短到十三小时十三分，重量从二十三公斤减少到十四公斤。这些革新，使我国液压传动的新技术又向前跨进了一步。
    液压传动操纵箱是精密磨床上的总枢纽，分操纵箱和进给箱两部分。上海机床厂工人第一次改进液压传动操纵箱是在1958年大跃进的时候。七级装配工、共产党员吴德伦决心从改进设计入手加快操纵箱的生产，并且设计了几十种图样。当时有人说，这是“太岁”头上“动土”。然而吴德伦革新设计的打算却得到了党支部的大力支持，工厂指定技术人员根据吴德伦的草图，画出详细的零件图和装配图，又通知各部门对试验新操纵箱的零件随到随做。这样，仅一个星期，吴德伦设计的操纵箱就试验成功了。
    1959年继续大跃进中，刚满师不久的二级工王伟道，再一次改进了操纵箱的设计，把零件又减少了三种，重量又减轻了两公斤，质量也更好。这件事激发了王伟道的师傅邬兴中的革新热情。他苦干了几天，画出了一张进给箱的草图。经过许多次失败，终于成功了。进给箱的零件从十六种减少到七种，性能也更好了。
    但是邬兴中并不以此为满足，他感到改进后的进给箱，体积还比较大，他打算把剩下的两根轴合并在一起。在设计草图的过程中，他遇到了一个困难：压力平衡的计算问题。他把这个问题带到自己在学习的榆林区业余高等工业专科学校，在理论力学教师的帮助下，这个困难也克服了。
    这时候，邬兴中的另一位已经出师的徒弟陈伟民，发现操纵箱和进给箱中有一根轴是类似的，就大胆地把轴从移动式改为转动式，使新的设计更为完善。这样，新型操纵箱就在今年的第一个工作日诞生了。
    四次革新的成就，使工人们深深理解：技术革新永无止境。现在他们又在作新的打算，在琢磨新的设计图样。
