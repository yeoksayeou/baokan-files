Wulian County's Experience in Breeding and Reproduction of Large Livestock
Xu Hongxiang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Wulian County Party Committee

In the past year, Wulian County, Shandong Province, has seen a 16.6% increase in large livestock. The land burdened by each draft animal has decreased from 30 mu in 1958 to 27 mu. The county currently has 4,271 breeding-age female animals, with a conception rate of 94%.

		Important Agenda Items

Wulian County is a mountainous area with 60,000 mu of pastures, 1.11 million mu of woodland, and 325,000 mu of oak forests, which provides favorable conditions for developing animal husbandry production. Based on the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, the County Party Committee has included animal husbandry production in its important agenda items and has made unified arrangements with agricultural, forestry, and other production activities, integrating them together. In order to complete the annual breeding plan of 4,200 head of large livestock, the County Party Committee put forward the battle cry of "Seize April for breeding, make a concentrated effort in May, and mop up in June" and victoriously complete "double sowing" (agriculture and livestock) in the spring of 1959. At the same time, it organized more than 500 breeding personnel, veterinarians, and epidemic prevention personnel, and more than 3,000 breeders, adopting the method of setting up key stations and establishing points in each team to carry out a concentrated breeding campaign. Thanks to the active participation of the broad masses, draft animal breeding accounted for 93% of breeding-age female animals from May to July 1959; in the autumn, another 350 head were supplemented, basically achieving full breeding and full conception.

	Political Command, Overall Mobilization

Our county's large livestock breeding and reproduction work has been carried out in the midst of continuous struggle against various conservative ideas. In carrying out this work, the masses were fully mobilized, and a great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters were conducted, with the topics: "Is it possible to have agricultural production without livestock?", "Rely on self-reliance, or rely on buying from other places?", "Can breeding work have a great leap forward?" Through in-depth airing of views and debates, the understanding of cadres and the masses was raised, and their thinking was unified. The County Party Committee established a diversified economy committee, and each commune established a diversified economy leading group to specifically lead this work. Then, the masses were mobilized to formulate a development plan for large livestock, and the plan was implemented down to the team, quickly launching a high tide of breeding and reproduction. The secretary of the Zhongzhi People's Commune Party Committee personally led breeding animals to the countryside for breeding, effectively inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses.

In order to vigorously carry out breeding and reproduction work, the County Party Committee took the Hou Lianchisi Production Team of the Yuli Commune, which raises the most female donkeys, and the Wu Lingou Production Team of the Kouguan Commune, which raises the most female cattle, as the base points, held on-site meetings, and promoted breeding. For example, the Lianchisi Production Team had 65 female donkeys, of which 63 conceived, with a conception rate of 98%, which boosted the confidence of all communes in self-breeding and self-raising. At the same time, the whole county launched a "four comparisons" competition campaign: "compare vigor, compare fullness of breasts, compare fatness, compare manure accumulation." Through comparisons and competitions between communes, between teams, and between individuals, more than 1,000 model individuals and 120 advanced production teams emerged, greatly promoting the breeding and reproduction movement throughout the county.

		Breaking Through Technical Barriers

To do a good job in breeding and reproduction, it is also necessary to break through technical barriers. Wulian County mainly focused on the four characters of "selection, mating, protection, and technology" in terms of technical measures.

"Selection" means selecting breeds and selecting mating partners. As the saying goes: Like gourd, like ladle; like seed, like seedling. Breed selection is the primary measure to ensure the quality of offspring. In breed selection, we mastered the standards of "one long" (body length), "one big" (large testicles), "three wide" (forehead, scapula, chest), "four narrow" (four hoof seams), "five short" (four legs and neck), and "six shiny" (four hooves and two eyes), and carried out the identification of breeding animals, selecting 309 breeding bulls, 41 breeding donkeys, and 2 breeding horses. Qualified breeding animals were issued qualification certificates. Based on breeding stations, the method of artificial assisted mating was comprehensively promoted, greatly improving the mating quality of livestock.

"Mating" means timely mating. During spring breeding, we put forward the slogan of "Fight hard for two months, work hard for forty days, and complete the mating task of large livestock", and adopted the method of assigning special personnel to be responsible for breeding-age female animals and assigning breeding animals to teams and fields, judging the estrus period of female animals, and conducting mating in a timely manner. Autumn is also a normal time for female animals to gain weight and estrus, so we also conducted a thorough inspection team by team, head by head, and trough by trough, and carried out supplementary mating and re-mating for non-pregnant female animals, thereby basically eliminating non-pregnancy.

"Protection" means ensuring the safety of pregnant animals. In order to achieve this requirement, we conducted rotational training for breeders, training a total of more than 2,800 breeders; and implemented a "four guarantees and one reward" system, namely, guaranteeing mating, guaranteeing conception, guaranteeing birth, and guaranteeing survival, with rewards given to those who produce offspring. In order to prevent early mating and random mating, pregnant animals, non-pregnant female animals, breeding animals, and female animals that have not reached breeding age were numbered and hung with different colored tags, and the management method of "four separations" and "four integrations" was generally promoted. That is: male animals, non-pregnant female animals, non-breeding age female animals, and pregnant animals are raised and managed separately; cadres, breeders, workers, and veterinarians exchange experience to improve management technology, thus basically eliminating miscarriage accidents of female animals.

"Technology" means carrying out technological innovation and popularizing breeding and reproduction technology. While strengthening leadership measures, the County Party Committee actively strengthened the technical team. The county trained 2,800 breeders, 200 large livestock breeding personnel, and 289 veterinarians, and adopted the method of technical instruction with pastures as schools and livestock as teaching materials, so that the personnel participating in the study could learn and use at the same time, and quickly mastered certain technologies in judging, mating, feeding management, and disease treatment. At the same time, through technological innovation, the old habit of "spring mating but not autumn mating" was broken, and autumn was turned into a good opportunity for large-scale mating. In terms of mating methods, in addition to seizing the natural estrus period of female animals for timely mating, the method of artificial estrus induction was vigorously promoted, combined with advanced mating experience such as blood mating, re-mating, repeated mating, multiple mating, and artificial insemination, which improved the conception rate and offspring production rate.

		Good Methods for Spreading Technology

In order to popularize breeding and reproduction technology, we collected and compiled many songs in terms of judgment, mastering the estrus period, identifying estrus, and feeding management, and disseminated them. For example, in terms of judgment and mating: "Estrus period, has long and short, old and young livestock are not the same; young female donkeys, estrus period is short, mating date should be advanced; old female donkeys, ovulation is late, it is best to mate on the fifth or sixth day." "Cattle mate before, horses mate after, donkeys mate on the fourth, fifth, and sixth (days)." In terms of identifying estrus: "Donkeys have estrus characteristics, as long as you pay attention, you can see; when you see male donkeys, they like to linger, cross their feet, arch their backs, and wag their tails; frequent urination, reduced appetite, restless standing and love to call; the vulva is swollen, sticky threads fall off, and the labia frequently turn outward." In terms of feeding technology: "To feed the livestock well, daily management is the most important, in summer and autumn, the weather is hot at noon, pay attention to prevent heatstroke and reduce labor, there are horseflies during the day and mosquitoes at night, remember to kill horseflies and smoke mosquitoes; in winter, the weather is cold and there is little green grass, pay attention to keeping warm and adjusting the feed; always be careful throughout the year, keep the pens clean and feed them fully, use them carefully and take good care of them, the livestock will gain weight and have good estrus." These songs are easy to understand and easy for the masses to remember and master and apply, which has played a great role in the development of livestock.

    五莲县大家畜配种繁殖经验
    中共五莲县委书记处书记  徐鸿翔
    山东五莲县一年来大家畜增长了16．6％。每头耕畜负担的土地，由1958年的三十亩减少到二十七亩。全县现有四千二百七十一头适龄母畜，配种受胎率达94％。
          重要的议事日程
    五莲县是一个山区，有六万亩牧场，一百一十一万亩林地和三十二万五千亩柞岚，这对发展畜牧业生产是个有利条件。县委根据中央、省委的指示，把畜牧业生产列入了重要议事日程，并且和农、林等项生产统一安排，结合进行。为了完成全年四千二百头大家畜配种计划，1959年春季县委提出了“4月抢配、5月突击、6月扫尾”和胜利完成“双播种”（农、畜）的战斗口号：同时组织了配种员、兽医员、防疫员五百多人和饲养员三千多人，采取了重点设站，队队设点的方法开展了突击配种运动。由于广大群众的积极行动，1959年5月至7月耕畜配种占适龄母畜的93％；秋季又补配三百五十头，基本上达到了全配全受胎。
        政治挂帅　全面发动
    我县大家畜配种繁殖工作是在不断地和各种各样保守思想的斗争中进行的。在开展这一工作时，充分地发动群众，开展了大鸣大放大辩论，题目是：“农业生产没牲畜行不行？”、“靠自力更生，还是靠从外地买？”、“配种工作能不能大跃进？”通过深入鸣放辩论，提高了干部、群众的认识，统一了思想。县委建立了多种经济委员会，各公社建立起多种经济领导小组，具体领导这一工作。接着，便发动群众制定大家畜发展规划，并把计划落实到队，迅速掀起配种繁殖的高潮。中至人民公社党委书记，亲自牵着种畜下乡配种，有效地鼓舞了群众的干劲。
    为使配种繁殖工作有力地开展，县委以养母驴最多的于里公社后莲池寺生产队和养母牛最多的叩官公社汙林沟生产队为基点，召开现场会，推广繁殖。如莲池寺生产队，有六十五头母驴受胎六十三头，受胎率达98％，鼓舞了各社自繁自养的信心。同时，全县开展了“比干劲，比满怀，比膘肥，比积肥”的四比竞赛运动，通过社与社、队与队、人与人之间的评比竞赛，涌现出一千余名模范人物和一百二十个先进生产队，大大促进了全县的配种繁殖运动。
                  大破技术关
    要使配种繁殖工作做得好，还必须大破技术关。五莲县在技术措施方面主要抓住了“选、配、保、技”四个字。
    “选”就是选种选配。俗话说：什么样的葫芦，什么样的瓢；什么样的种子，什么样的苗。选种是保证提高产仔质量的首要措施。在选种上，我们掌握了“一长”（身长）“一大”（睪丸大）“三宽”（脑门、肩胛、胸）“四窄”（四个蹄缝）“五短”（四腿和脖子）“六光亮”（四蹄和两眼）的标准，进行了种畜的鉴定，选出种牛三百零九头，种驴四十一头，种马两匹。合格的种畜发给合格证，以配种站为基础，全面推行人工辅助配种的办法，大大提高了牲畜配种质量。
      “配”就是适时配种。春季配种时，我们提出了“大战两个月，苦战四十天，完成大家畜的配种任务”的口号，并对适龄母畜采取专人负责和定种畜到队、到田的方法，判别母畜发情期，及时进行配种。秋季也是母畜增膘发情正常的时机，因此，我们又进行了逐队逐头逐槽大检查，对空怀母畜实行补配、复配，从而基本上消灭了空怀。
    “保”是保证孕畜安全。为了达到这一要求，我们对饲养员进行了轮训，共训练饲养员二千八百余名；并实行了“四保一奖”制度，即保配、保受胎、保产、保成活，产仔者予以奖励。为防止早配、乱配，分别对孕畜、空怀母畜、种畜、未到适龄期的母畜进行编号和挂不同颜色的牌，普遍推行了“四分”、“四结合”的管理工作方法。即：公畜、空怀母畜、不适龄母畜、孕畜分别饲养管理；干部、饲养员、使役员、兽医员交流经验，提高管理技术，因而基本上消灭了母畜流产事故。
    “技”是开展技术革新和普及配种繁殖技术。县委在加强领导措施的同时，积极壮大了技术队伍。全县训练了二千八百名饲养员，二百名大家畜配种员和二百八十九名兽医员，并采取以牧场为学校，以牲畜为教材的技术传授方法，使参加学习的人员边学边用，很快地在判情、配种、饲养管理和疾病治疗方面掌握了一定的技术。同时，通过技术革新，打破了“春配秋不配”的旧习惯，把秋季变成了大搞配种的良机。在配种方法上，除抓紧了母畜的自然发情期及时配种外，还大力推行了人工催情的方法，结合采取血配、重配、复配、多次配、人工授精等先进配种经验，提高了怀胎率和产仔率。
                传播技术的好方法
    为了普及配种繁殖技术，我们在判情、掌握情期、鉴别发情、饲养管理等方面搜集和编出许多歌谣，加以传播。如在判情配种方面：“发情期，有长短，老少牲口不一般；小母驴，情期短，配种日期要提前；老母驴，排卵晚，最好配在五、六天。”“牛配前，马配后，驴子配种四、五、六（天）。”在鉴别发情方面：“驴发情有特点，只要留心就看见；见公驴，爱留恋，叉脚弓腰尾巴欠；尿尿勤，食量减，站立不宁爱叫唤；阴门肿，掉粘线，阴唇频频向外翻。”在饲养技术方面：“要把牲口喂的好，日常管理最重要，夏秋中午天气热，注意防暑少役劳，日有牛虻夜有蚊，灭虻熏蚊要记牢；冬季天寒青草少，注意保温调好料；一年四季常留心，做到栏净喂的饱，使用小心多爱护，牲口上膘发情好。”这些歌谣顺口易懂，群众听了就能记住和掌握运用，对发展牲畜起了很大作用。
