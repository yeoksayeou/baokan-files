Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 13th: The Vietnamese Labor Party's newspaper "People's Daily" published an article today entitled "New Victories of China's 'Three Magic Weapons' for Socialist Construction," highly praising the great achievements of the Chinese people's economic construction in 1959.

The article emphasized: "The great achievements made by the Chinese people through a year of creative and courageous labor once again demonstrate the amazing power of the 'three magic weapons' for socialist construction found by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong—the general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward movement, and the people's commune movement." The article stated, "China's Great Leap Forward in 1959 was a victory for the Chinese Communist Party's correct policies and the mass movement led by the Party."

The article cited many specific examples to powerfully illustrate the great achievements of China's economic construction in continuing its Great Leap Forward in 1959.

In discussing how the Chinese people overcame severe natural disasters unseen in decades last year and overfulfilled the original targets for agricultural production, the article stated, "Faced with this severe test, the 26,000 young people's communes immediately took root and demonstrated vigorous vitality in disaster relief, ensuring harvests, and maintaining the people's living standards."

The article said, "The main targets of China's Second Five-Year Plan have been completed three years ahead of schedule, and this Great Leap Forward has laid a solid foundation for the Chinese people to continue to leap forward in the future." The article pointed out that this foreshadows the glorious prospect of the Chinese people catching up with and surpassing Britain in the output of major industrial products within ten years.

The article concluded, "We have every reason to believe that 1960 will be a year of even greater leaps forward for China, a year of 'good start, red every month, red to the end'."

    越南“人民报”发表文章
    盛赞我国“三个法宝”的新胜利
    新华社河内13日电　越南劳动党机关报“人民报”今天发表题为“中国社会主义建设‘三个法宝’的新胜利”的文章，盛赞中国人民1959年经济建设的伟大成就。
    文章强调指出：“中国人民经过一年的创造性的勇敢的劳动所取得的巨大成就，再一次显示了中国共产党和中国人民在毛泽东主席领导下所找到的社会主义建设‘三个法宝’——社会主义建设总路线、大跃进运动和人民公社化运动的惊人力量。”文章说，“中国在1959年的大跃进是中国共产党的正确政策和党所领导的群众运动的胜利。”
    文章引用许多具体事例，有力地说明了中国经济建设在1959年继续大跃进的巨大成就。
    在谈到中国人民在去年战胜了几十年来所未有的严重自然灾害，超额完成农业生产原定指标时，文章说，“面临着这个严酷的考验，两万六千个年青的人民公社立即生根，并在抗灾、保证收获和人民生活水平方面显示出蓬勃的生命力。”
    文章说，“中国第二个五年计划的主要指标已经提前三年完成，这个大跃进为中国人民今后的继续跃进，打下了稳固的基础”。文章指出，这预示着中国人民在十年内在主要的工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国的光辉前景。
    文章最后说，“我们有充分的理由相信，1960年将是中国更大跃进的一年，将是‘开门红，月月红，红到底’的一年。”
