Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 31st - As the clock struck midnight on the 29th, cheers erupted from the workers as shiny black coal chunks rolled from the mine shaft onto the conveyor belt. The Red Flag Coal Mining Team of the Xishan Coal Mine in Taiyuan successfully concluded its grand exercise to kick off 1960 with a flying start.

To welcome the prosperous start of 1960, the workers of the Red Flag Coal Mining Team held a "Zhuge Liang" meeting on the new work surface before starting their shift. Wang Peizhen, a veteran worker who had attended the National Congress of Heroes, said: "To ensure the normal operation of the machines, we must maintain them well at all times." He suggested that each group set up one or two equipment maintenance personnel to regularly check and supervise this work. In order to increase production without increasing manpower, team leader Wei Shuangquan proposed a plan to advance towards mechanization. Subsequently, the coal mining, support, and transportation groups each put forward innovative suggestions.

In 1959, the Red Flag Coal Mining Team averaged 32,000 tons of coal mined per month and was recognized as the national champion for large-area high yield at the National Congress of Heroes. Filled with lofty aspirations and great ambition, they recently proposed a goal of producing 50,000 tons per month.

    红旗采煤队新年红旗飘
    据新华社太原31日电　29日深夜零点，当乌亮的煤块从井下随着皮带运输机滚滚流向地面时，工人们发出了一片喝采声。太原西山煤矿红旗采煤队为1960年开门红举行的大演习胜利了。
    红旗采煤队的工人为了迎接1960年开门红，上班前在新的工作面上开了个“诸葛亮”会。曾经出席全国群英会的老工人王培珍说：要使机器正常运转，全靠平常好好维护。他建议每个小组都设一两个设备维修员，好经常检查、督促这项工作。为了增产不增人，队长魏双全提出了向机械化进军的方案。随着，采煤、支柱、运输各个小组，分别提出了革新建议。
    红旗采煤队在1959年中每月平均采煤达三万二千吨，在全国群英会上被评为全国大面积丰产第一名。他们立大志，抱雄心，最近又提出了月产五万吨的奋斗目标。
