    ——A "Public Trial" of West German Refugee Minister Oberländer

    Page 286 of the West German "Federal Parliament Guide" records the biography of West German Refugee Minister Oberländer:
    "Born in Meiningen on May 1, 1905. Christian. University professor. Studied at the Meiningen Fröbel School from 1914 to 1923. Studied agriculture in Munich, Hamburg, and Berlin from 1923 to 1927. Studied economics in Berlin and Königsberg from 1928 to 1930. Postgraduate in agricultural economics from 1930 to 1932, Doctor of Political Science, Doctor of Agricultural Science, traveled to the Soviet Union, Canada, and the United States to investigate agriculture. Appointed lecturer at the University of Königsberg in 1933. Director of the Eastern Economic Institute in Danzig, guest professor of agricultural policy in 1934. Full professor at the University of Königsberg from 1937 to 1938. Full professor at the University of Greifswald from 1938 to 1939. Professor of public law at the German University of Prague in 1940. Served in the military from 1940 to 1945, as an army captain, captured."
    Judging from this resume, Oberländer is a gentle scholar, institute director, and university professor. He served in the military. But, in the Hitler era, who could avoid military service?
    However, according to materials successively revealed by the West German press after the war, Oberländer was not only an old Nazi Party member who entered the Soviet Union four times to collect political and military intelligence, but he also served as the commander of Hitler's "Nightingale Battalion," massacring more than 3,000 peaceful residents of the Soviet city of Lviv on July 3, 1941. Under the guise of a scholar and professor, Oberländer was originally a Nazi spy and executioner who did not blink an eye when killing people.
    Not long ago, the German Unification Issues Committee held a press conference in democratic Berlin. Albert Norden, a member of the Political Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, presented a large amount of evidence at the meeting to prove that Oberländer was the "commander and political officer" of the "Nightingale Battalion." From June 30 to July 6, 1941, when the "Nightingale Battalion" was stationed in the West Ukrainian city of Lviv (returned to the Soviet Union by Poland after the war), it carried out a brutal massacre. The press conference turned into a "public trial" of West German Refugee Minister Oberländer.
    On September 28 last year, the organ of the Association of Victims of Fascism in West Germany, the weekly "Action," reprinted the evidence provided at this reception. Oberländer woke up a federal judge in the middle of the night and asked him to sign an order to confiscate the "Action" weekly. A few days later, the Bonn government declared the Association of Victims of Fascism a "subversive organization."
    In order to cover up this bloody history of crime, Oberländer personally held a press conference to deny the accusations against him. Oberländer said that he was merely a lieutenant in the "Nightingale Battalion." He denied the bloody crimes of the "Nightingale Battalion," saying that not a single shot was fired during the week the "Nightingale Battalion" was stationed in Lviv.
    Then, the German Unification Issues Committee held another "public trial" of Oberländer in democratic Berlin, proving that Oberländer was not only a fascist and war criminal, but also a liar and deceiver. This time, the "public trial" thoroughly exposed the true face of the Nazi war criminal with more facts.
    Oberländer's "friend," another Nazi war criminal, Hans Koch, published a book in 1958 entitled "Germany and Ukraine" (published by the East European College of Munich, West Germany). Page 141 of this book states: "Professor Oberländer was appointed captain commander and political officer of the Nightingale Battalion. He was assisted by two captains, several lieutenants, and non-commissioned officers."
    The press conference showed many television programs of witnesses testifying. These included the testimony of Mrs. Bartel. Mrs. Bartel's husband, Kazimir Bartel, had served as Prime Minister of the former Poland between 1926 and 1930. Mrs. Bartel testified:
    "It is a complete fact that the scholars of Lviv were massacred by the German fascists, especially the members of the so-called 'Nightingale Battalion'. The reason why my husband was not immediately killed with his other colleagues after his arrest on July 2 was for special reasons. The fascists hoped that my husband would act as Quisling (Note: Quisling was the head of the Norwegian fascists, a puppet of the Nazis). When they found it could not be done, they executed him as well."
    The evidence of Oberländer's crimes revealed by this "public trial" made him very fearful. On October 20, the American "New York Herald Tribune" reported the news that a Ukrainian named Stepan Bandera had been poisoned to death. According to the American "Workers' Weekly" on November 29, Bandera was a Ukrainian fascist who had closely "cooperated" with the "Nightingale Battalion" in the past and participated in the massacre crimes of the "Nightingale Battalion." In recent years, Bandera was the head of the exiled reactionary organization Ukrainian Anti-Communist Intelligence Bureau, engaged in anti-Soviet and anti-communist criminal activities in Munich, West Germany. The "Workers' Weekly" said that observers in Berlin believe that Bandera's poisoning was likely due to his knowing too much about the "Nightingale Battalion" affair.
    The "public trial" also revealed Oberländer's early criminal activities. According to Nazi archive materials on Oberländer held by the German Unification Issues Committee, Oberländer participated in the Hitler coup in Munich as early as 1923. In 1933, he officially joined the National Socialist Party. In 1934, he was appointed leader of the "German Eastern Revanchist League," participating in planning espionage and sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and other countries. From 1937 until before World War II, Oberländer was an important member of the Seventh Military District Intelligence and Sabotage Department of the Nazis. At that time, the headquarters of the Seventh Military District was stationed in Breslau.
    The German Unification Issues Committee stated that it is willing to submit all the evidence in the "public trial" to the West German judicial authorities for prosecution and trial of this Nazi war criminal. However, Oberländer, protected by the Bonn government, still safely holds the important position of West German Refugee Minister.
    On November 12, Oberländer even arrived in West Berlin to carry out "cold war" activities. The news of Oberländer's arrival in West Berlin immediately aroused great anger among Berlin residents. The West Berlin municipal authorities received a large number of letters, telegrams, and resolutions from residents in East and West Berlin, demanding that Oberländer get out of West Berlin. Many groups protested against Oberländer's arrival in West Berlin. The democratic Berlin newspapers published a statement by the German Unification Issues Committee on November 27. This statement systematically exposed Oberländer's fascist war crimes. Now, the broad public of Germany and peace-loving people of all countries want to know: why is such a Nazi war criminal with blood on his hands still able to remain at large and be allowed to continue to hold a prominent position in the Bonn government?

    希特勒的“夜莺”
    ——西德难民部长奥勃兰德尔“公审”记
    乐山
    西德“联邦议院指南”第二百八十六页，记载着有关西德现任难民部长奥勃兰德尔的简历：
    “1905年，5月1日，生于迈宁根。信奉基督教。大学教授。1914年—1923年，在迈宁根博爱学校念书。1923—1927年，在慕尼黑、汉堡、柏林攻读农业。1928—1930年，在柏林、哥尼斯堡研究经济。1930—1932年，农业经济学研究生，获政治科学博士、农业科学博士，游历苏联、加拿大、美国考察农业。1933年受任为哥尼斯堡大学讲师。1934年，但泽东方经济研究所主任、农业政策客籍教授。1937年—1938年，哥尼斯堡大学专任教授。1938年—1939年，格来福华大学专任教授。1940年，布拉格德国大学公法教授。1940年—1945年，服军役，任陆军上尉，被俘。”
    从这份简历看来，奥勃兰德尔是一个文质彬彬的学者、研究所主任、大学教授。他服过军役。但是，在希特勒时代，谁能免服军役呢？
    可是，根据战后西德报刊陆续揭发的材料，奥勃兰德尔不但是一个老纳粹党徒，曾四次进入苏联收集政治、军事情报；他还充当过希特勒“夜莺营”的司令官，在1941年7月3日屠杀过苏联利沃夫城和平居民三千多人。在学者、教授名义掩盖下的奥勃兰德尔，原来是一个杀人不眨眼的纳粹间谍和刽子手。
    不久以前，德国统一问题委员会在民主柏林举行了记者招待会。德国统一社会党政治局委员阿·诺登在会上提出大量证据，证明奥勃兰德尔是“夜莺营”的“司令官兼政治官员”。1941年6月30日至7月6日，“夜莺营”驻扎于西乌克兰利沃夫城（战后由波兰归还苏联）时，曾进行过惨绝人寰的大屠杀。记者招待会变成了对西德现任难民部长奥勃兰德尔的“公审”。
    去年9月28日，西德的受法西斯主义之害者协会的机关刊物“行动”周刊，转载了这个招待会提供的证据。奥勃兰德尔深夜把一名联邦法官唤醒，要他签字下令没收“行动”周刊。不多几日，波恩政府就宣布受法西斯主义之害者协会为“颠覆性组织”。
    为了遮盖这段血腥的罪恶史，奥勃兰德尔亲自举行了一个记者招待会，否认对他的控诉。奥勃兰德尔说，他在“夜莺营”里，仅仅是一个中尉。他抵赖“夜莺营”的血腥罪行说，在“夜莺营”驻扎于利沃夫城的一周间，没有发过一枪一弹。
    接着，德国统一问题委员会在民主柏林再次举行了对奥勃兰德尔的“公审”，证明奥勃兰德尔不仅是一个法西斯分子和战犯，而且是一个撒谎家和骗子。这一次“公审”，以更多的事实彻底地揭露了纳粹战犯的真面目。
    奥勃兰德尔的“朋友”、另一纳粹战犯汉斯·科西于1958年出版了“德国与乌克兰”一书（由西德慕尼黑东欧学院发行）。这本书的第一百四十一页说：“奥勃兰德尔教授受任为夜莺营上尉司令官和政治官员。协助他的有两名上尉、若干名中尉和下士。”
    招待会放映了许多证人作证的电视节目。其中包括巴尔特尔夫人的作证。巴尔特尔夫人的丈夫卡兹米尔·巴尔特尔，于1926—1930年间曾经出任旧波兰的内阁总理。巴尔特尔夫人作证说：
    “利沃夫的学者们被德国法西斯、尤其是所谓‘夜莺营’的分子所屠杀，完全是事实。我的丈夫于7月2日被捕以后，没有立即同其他的同事一道被杀，是有特别的原因的。法西斯分子希望我的丈夫充当吉斯林（按：吉斯林为挪威法西斯魁首，纳粹的傀儡）。当他们发现无法办到的时候，就把他也处决了。”
    这次“公审”揭发出来的奥勃兰德尔的罪证，使他非常恐惧。10月20日美国“纽约先驱论坛报”报道了一个名叫斯捷潘·班得拉的乌克兰人被毒死的消息。据11月29日美国“工人周报”说，班得拉是乌克兰的法西斯分子，过去与“夜莺营”密切“合作”，参与了“夜莺营”的大屠杀罪行。最近几年以来，班得拉是流亡反动团体乌克兰反共情报局的首脑，在西德慕尼黑从事反苏、反共罪恶活动。“工人周报”说，柏林的观察家认为，班得拉的被毒死，很可能是由于他对“夜莺营”事情知道得太多了。
      “公审”还揭发了奥勃兰德尔早年的罪恶活动。根据德国统一问题委员会所掌握的有关奥勃兰德尔的纳粹档案材料，早在1923年，奥勃兰德尔就参加了在慕尼黑发生的希特勒政变。1933年，他正式加入国社党。1934年，他被任命为“德国东方复仇主义联盟”的领导人，参与策划对苏联和其他国家进行间谍活动和破坏活动。从1937年起直到第二次世界大战以前，奥勃兰德尔是纳粹第七军区间谍破坏处的重要人员。当时，第七军区的司令部驻在布累斯劳。
    德国统一问题委员会声明，愿意把“公审”中的一切证据提交西德司法当局，以便对这位纳粹战犯进行起诉和审判。可是，在波恩政府庇护下的奥勃兰德尔，至今仍旧安然无恙地担任着西德难民部长的重要职务。
    11月12日，奥勃兰德尔竟到达西柏林进行“冷战”活动。奥勃兰德尔抵达西柏林的消息，即刻激起了柏林居民的极大愤怒。西柏林市政当局收到了大量东西柏林居民寄来的信件、电报和决议书，他们要求奥勃兰德尔从西柏林滚出去。许多团体都对奥勃兰德尔的到达西柏林表示抗议。民主柏林各报于11月27日刊载了德国统一问题委员会的一项声明。这个声明系统地揭露了奥勃兰德尔的法西斯战争罪行。现在，德国广大公众和世界各国和平人民要求知道：为什么这样一个两手血污的纳粹战争罪犯，至今仍然能够逍遥法外，并且被允许继续担任波恩政府的显赫职务？
