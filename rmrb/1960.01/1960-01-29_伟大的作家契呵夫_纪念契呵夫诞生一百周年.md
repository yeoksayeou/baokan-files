    The Great Writer Chekhov
    —Commemorating the Centenary of Chekhov's Birth
  　Soviet Union　Da. Saslavsky
    Anton Pavlovich Chekhov's name is known throughout the world. His name is placed alongside those of Russian writers such as Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Gorky. One of Chekhov's earliest works—the novella "The Steppe"—already showed him to be an outstanding artist. In this novella, the dawns and sunsets, the clear days and thunderstorms of the boundless Ukrainian steppe, and the vividly depicted images of ordinary people, simply delighted readers.

    All of Chekhov's works are filled with social content. Even in his early stories and humorous short stories, there were profound socio-political commentaries, and the humor had a satirical ring. For example, the short story "Sergeant Prishibeyev" is such a work.

    The protagonist of the work is a discharged police sergeant. At the time, he had become accustomed to promoting the Tsarist barrack system. Even when he lived in the countryside, he could not abandon his former habits: engaging in secret investigation activities, cracking down on youth gatherings in the evening, and prohibiting the lighting of lamps and the singing of joyful songs in small huts at night. All of this seemed terrible and suspicious to him. He interfered in everything, making life unbearable for those around him...

    There is much humor in the work, but this humor produces a disturbing impression. In the space of two or three pages, the Tsarist system is profoundly depicted with amazing artistic imagery. The name Prishibeyev, as a symbol of autocracy, entered Russian literature and became a common term. Obviously, the young writer was a successor to Shchedrin's sharp political satire.

    Nature in Chekhov's works is always closely connected with people. Nature is the background that reveals people's destinies, feelings, worries and anxieties, frustrations and fortunes.

    Chekhov's excellent play "The Cherry Orchard" has been performed at the Moscow Art Theatre for many years with unchanging success. When the curtain rises on the theater stage, we see through the spacious windows of the aristocratic estate the slender branches of cherry trees with flowers so numerous they appear drenched in milk, and the entire audience hall seems to be permeated with the delicate fragrance of cherry trees full of flower spikes. The garden is extremely beautiful, but its masters are representatives of the decadent class of the century, and Chekhov treats them with pity and ridicule. They are helpless and incurable.

    In "The Cherry Orchard," a picture of pre-revolutionary Russia, which is extraordinary in its artistic depth, unfolds before us. Chekhov's works reflect, with poignant force, the autocratic system on the eve of its decay and collapse, and the social environment of Russia before the demise of the Tsarist system.

    Chekhov often highlights the images of outstanding, intelligent, and talented people. It would be good if they could live and work rationally and make life better. However, they are fragile, they are corroded by the vulgarity of the petty bourgeoisie, they gradually fall into pessimism and despair, distrust their own strength, and sometimes escape from life. For example, the old professor in the short story "A Dreary Story." He is an outstanding scholar who enjoys external honor, but he is lonely and has lost his faith in life. "The House with the Mezzanine" shows a talented artist who loves his motherland but seeks the meaning of life in vain. He feels the need for some fundamental change, but he does not see where this change will come from, and the complacent little people are stimulating him.

    Chekhov's works are concise and succinct, but they raise, with great force, the same exciting moral and socio-political issues as Tolstoy's and Dostoevsky's giant novels. Chekhov speaks as a great humanist, who soberly sees the absurdity, injustice, and cruelty of class society, sees the insignificance of those who hold power, and tries hard to find a way out of the predicament.

    Chekhov never compromised with the bourgeois system. His works are full of faith in the approaching storm—the old pillars will be swept away. He lived in the dawning hours of the revolution. When the light of dawn had not yet appeared, he already heard new calls in the thick pre-dawn fog. This call had already begun to be sung high and loud in the first works of M. Gorky. Chekhov greeted this call with overflowing friendship. He loved the heroic and fearless heroes in the short stories of this young proletarian writer.

    Chekhov did not live to see with his own eyes the great changes on the land of Russia that he so eagerly anticipated. If he could have lived a little longer, he could have seen how the people who had seized power began to transform life, how the peasants who had gotten rid of the oppressors cultivated thousands of miraculous cherry orchards, and how the new socialist culture blossomed.

### 伟大的作家契呵夫——纪念契呵夫诞生一百周年

    伟大的作家契呵夫
    ——纪念契呵夫诞生一百周年
  　苏联　达·萨斯拉夫斯基
    安东·巴甫洛维奇·契呵夫的名字在全世界是人们都熟知的。他的名字是与屠格涅夫、托尔斯泰、陀思妥耶夫斯基、高尔基这样的俄罗斯作家的名字并列在一起的。契呵夫的第一批作品之一——中篇小说“草原”就已经显示出他是一位杰出的艺术家。在这个中篇小说里，乌克兰万里无垠的草原上的黎明和黄昏、晴天和雷雨的景象、描绘得性格鲜明的普通人的形象，简直使读者心旷神怡。
    契呵夫的一切作品都充满了社会的内容。还在他早期的故事小说里和诙谐的短篇小说里，就已包含有深刻的社会政治性评述，而幽默却具有讽刺性的音响。例如，“普利希别耶夫中士”短篇小说就是这样的作品。
    作品的主人公是一名解职的警察。当时，他已习惯于推广沙皇兵营的制度。他住在乡村的时候也不能放弃自己从前的习气：从事暗探活动，取缔青年晚间集会，禁止深夜在小茅屋点灯火和唱欢乐的歌曲。这一切对于他仿佛都是可怕的和令人可疑的。他干涉一切，使周围人的生活难以忍受……
    在作品中有许多幽默，但这种幽默产生一种令人惊心动魄的印象。用惊人的艺术形象在两三页的篇幅内就把沙皇制度深刻地刻划出来了，普利希别耶夫的名字，作为专制的象征进入俄罗斯文坛的同时，也成了通用的术语了。显然，年轻的作家是谢德林尖锐的政治性讽刺的继承人。
    契呵夫作品里的大自然总是与人紧密相连的，大自然是显示人的命运、感情、忧虑和惊惶、挫折和幸运的背景。
    契呵夫的优秀剧本“樱桃园”多年来一直以不变的成就在莫斯科艺术剧院上演，当剧院舞台上的帷幕拉开的时候，我们通过贵族庄园的宽敞的窗户看见花花朵朵、仿佛奶汁欲滴的樱桃树的纤枝，似乎整个观众大厅都润透了花穗满枝的樱桃树细腻的芳香。庭园美妙极啦，但是，它的主人是这个世纪颓废阶级的代表人物，而契呵夫以怜悯和嘲笑来对待他们。他们孤立无援，他们不可救药。
    在“樱桃园”里，在我们的面前展现出一幅就其艺术的深度而言乃是非凡的、鲜明的革命前俄国的图画。在契呵夫的作品里，以动人心弦的力量，反映出腐朽的崩溃前夜的专制制度，反映出沙皇制度垂亡之前的俄国的社会环境。
    契呵夫往往突出优秀的、聪明的、天才人物的形象。他们若能有理性地生活和劳动，使生活变得美好就好了。但是，他们脆弱，他们受到小市民的庸俗的腐蚀，他们逐渐陷入悲观失望，不信任自己的力量，有时逃避生活。例如短篇小说“没意思的故事”中的老教授。这是一位卓越的学者，他享有外表的荣誉，但却孤独，失去对生活的信念。在“带阁楼的房子”里显示出一位天才的艺术家，他热爱自己的祖国，但徒劳无益地找寻生活的意义。他感觉到需要某种根本的变革，但是他未看到这种变革将来自何方，而沾沾自喜的小人物却在刺激着他。
    契呵夫的作品严密而简练，但是里面以巨大的力量提出了像托尔斯泰和陀思妥耶夫斯基的小说巨著里一样激奋人心的道德和社会政治问题。契呵夫作为伟大的人道主义者在发言，他清醒地看到阶级社会的荒唐、非正义和残酷，看到握有政权的那些人的渺小，并且极力寻找摆脱困境的出路。
    契呵夫从未与资产阶级的制度妥协。在他的作品里充满对暴风雨即将到来的信念——旧的柱石将一扫而光。他生活在革命的破晓时辰。当黎明的曙光还未显露的时候，就已经在浓厚的破晓前的烟雾里听到了新的呼唤。这种呼唤在马·高尔基的第一批作品里就已经开始高歌昂扬。契呵夫友情洋溢地迎接了这呼唤。他喜爱这青年无产阶级作家短篇小说里英勇无畏的英雄。
    契呵夫未能活到亲眼看见他如此热情期待的俄罗斯大地上的剧变。他若能再稍稍多活几天，他就能看见掌握了政权的人民如何开始改造生活，摆脱压迫者的农民如何培植成千上万奇迹般的樱桃园，新的社会主义的文化如何百花盛开。
