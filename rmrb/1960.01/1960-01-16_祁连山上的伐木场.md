    Logging Site in the Qilian Mountains
    Da Bo
    The Qilian Mountain forest has its unique characteristics. People often use "boundless forest sea" to describe its vastness and density. The most peculiar thing is that in that sea-like forest, only spruce trees grow - the Qilian people call them "cloud spruce." Not a single other species of tree can be found. The cloud spruce has a straight trunk and needle-like branches that stretch high into the sky, evergreen in all seasons, and very lovely!

      Hundred Flower Gate
    The entrance to the logging site is very distinctive. It faces a mountain pass on the highway. A mountain road, like a staircase, leads directly from the mountain to the side of the highway. The loggers call it the "Leap Forward Steps." Going up the steps, you enter the forest area. The winding road is full of various wildflowers, red, yellow, blue, white... Among the flowers, there are also red wild cherries the size of lychees, with a sweet taste; sour wild plums are best for quenching thirst. Loggers always like to pick a few and put them in their pockets when they enter the mountains, and eat one when they are thirsty. Strangely enough, after you walk through this section of the mountain road, the flowers and fruits become scarce in the depths of the forest. Therefore, the loggers call this place "Hundred Flower Gate." Look at the colorful and bright flowers blooming on both sides of the road, so much like a natural archway made of fresh flowers!
        "Red Highway"
    After walking through the mountain entrance, you are greeted by a flat highway leading directly to the logging site. The captain of the logging team said to me: "This is our 'Red Highway'!" This is a simple forest road, which seems to have been recently built. The fertile black soil in the forest is still gleaming! So, how did this simple forest road built of black soil come to be called the "Red Highway"?
    For the past few years, the Qilian logging team has been transporting timber using wooden tracks, laying the timber on the ground to form a road. Workers manually carried the timber onto the track, and pulled the timber down the mountain. This method of transportation was very inefficient. Even a piece of timber five or six meters long required a worker to use a rope to drag it down the mountain, wasting manpower and time. As early as the beginning of September last year, the Qilian logging team had exceeded its annual logging task ahead of schedule, but the timber could not be transported out of the mountain quickly. Although there were mountains of timber in the mountains, the timber supply at the foot of the mountain still could not keep up with the needs of the timber-using units. The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on the increase production and practice economy movement greatly encouraged the workers of the logging team. All the loggers organized themselves to rush to repair the road. All the cadres of the logging team also went to the mountain to participate in the road construction rush. In just half a month, this simple forest road, more than ten kilometers long, was completed.
    Building a forest road has been the long-cherished wish of the loggers for many years. However, in the past, people only thought about it but did not dare to do it. Now it has been accomplished in just half a month. The main reason is that under the guidance of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the logging workers opposed right-leaning complacency and fear of difficulties, and mustered greater efforts. Politics took command, and the highway quickly went up the mountain! "Red Highway" is a name with profound meaning given by the loggers.
      The Loggers' Song
    Along the "Red Highway," past several high piles of timber, a scene of joyful labor unfolds before your eyes: some loggers are transporting timber to the vicinity of the highway, preparing for trucks to load it; others are logging... The forest is bustling with activity. The sound of logging, the loud crashing of trees falling, the loggers' joyful and enthusiastic work songs... All kinds of sounds are intertwined... forming a beautiful movement!
    On the left side of the highway, eight or nine workers are moving a large piece of timber about one meter in diameter to the side of the highway. Their movements are coordinated, and they are all mentally tense and happy, moving while chanting work songs.
    That is the Red Flag Group of the logging team. They are all Salar people, and their ancestors have been loggers for generations. Look at that young man walking in front. He is an advanced producer named He Haiziri. His grandfather worked as a logger from the age of fifteen until he retired at the age of sixty-eight with white hair. His father was also a logger, and his legs were broken by the heinous Ma Bufang bandit gang before liberation...
    Suddenly, a loud song came from the right side of the highway:
    In forestry production, we compete in enthusiasm,
    To seize the red flag,
    Challenge and respond, work harder!
    Actively fight in the forest,
    Strive for the top,
    Leap forward, leap forward again! ...
    There, a dozen young loggers are sitting by a campfire, drinking tea and singing Qinghai folk songs! That is the logging team taking a break to drink tea. Comrade Wang Jun and I walked over to them and sat down by the campfire. The optimistic and talkative loggers were constantly telling us about the production competition. Listening to their voices, there were people from Qinghai, Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and even Guangdong... The captain smiled and said to me: "The young men in our Qilian logging team come from all over the country. Some of them have been here for less than a year, but they quickly got used to the cold climate here and learned the logging techniques. They are as close as brothers! If it weren't for the difference in accents, you would think they were all old Qinghai people!"

    祁连山上的伐木场
    大波
    祁连山森林，有它独具的特色，人们常常用“林海无边”来形容它的广大和茂密，最奇特的是，在那海一样宽广的森林里，全都长的是杉树——祁连人称“云杉”，找不到一株旁的树种。云杉，树干笔直，枝叶像钢针一般，在高空中伸展，四季常青，十分可爱！
      百　花　门
    伐木场的大门是十分别致的。它是面对公路的一个山口，一条像楼梯似的山路，从山上直通到公路旁，伐木工人把它称作“跃进台阶”。上了台阶，就进入林区了。蜿蜒曲折的路旁，长满了各色各样的野花，有红的，有黄的，有蓝的，有白的……。在花丛中，还长着红色的像荔枝一样大小的野樱桃，味道香甜；酸味的野梅子，最能解渴，伐木工人进山时，总爱摘上几颗放在衣袋里，渴了就吃上一个，说也奇怪，你走完这段进山的路，在林子深处，花果就少了。所以，伐木工人把这里叫做“百花门”。你看那彩色斑烂的花朵，在路的两旁争艳齐放，多么像鲜花扎成的天然彩门啊！
        “红色公路”
    走完进山路，迎面就是一条平坦的公路，一直通向伐木场。采伐队队长对我说：“这就是我们的‘红色公路’啦！”这是一条简易林区公路，看来刚修筑不久，森林里肥沃的黑土还油光闪闪的哩！那么这黑土筑成的简易林区公路，怎么竟叫做“红色公路”呢？
    祁连采伐队几年来都是用木道运材，将木材在地上铺成一条道路，用人力把木材搬在道上，工人们拉着木材由山上往山下滑。这种运输方法的效率很低，即使是一件五、六米长的木材，也要一个工人用绳子套住往山下拉，费人工又费时间。早在去年9月初，祁连采伐队就提前超额完成了全年的采伐任务，但是，木材不能很快运出山去，尽管山里木材堆成山，山下的木材仍赶不上用材单位的需要。党的八届八中全会关于增产节约运动的决议，极大地鼓舞了采伐队职工。全体伐木工人就组织起来突击抢修，采伐队全体干部也上山参加突击修路，不过半个月，这条长达十余公里的简易林区公路建成了。
    修筑林区公路，是伐木工人多年来的愿望。但是，人们过去只是想，却没敢动手做，现在只用半个月就办成了。主要原因是，采伐职工在八届八中全会精神的指导下，反对了右倾松劲畏难情绪，鼓足了更大的干劲，政治挂了帅，公路就很快上山了！“红色公路”这是伐木工人取的含义很深的名字。
      伐木人的歌声
    沿着“红色公路”前进，越过几处高高的木材堆，眼前展现出一片欢乐的劳动的场面：伐木工人们有的正在把木材运到公路近旁，准备汽车来装运，有的正在采伐……。森林里人声鼎沸。伐木声，树木倒下的巨响，工人们唱的欢腾热烈的号子……，各种各样的声音交织在一起，……组成了一首美妙的乐章！
    在公路左侧，有八、九个工人正在把一件直径约一米的大木材往公路旁搬运，他们动作协调，个个精神紧张而又愉快，一面搬运，一面喊着劳动号子。
    那是采伐队的红旗小组，他们全是撒拉族人，祖祖代代都是伐木工人。你看那走在前面的那个小伙子，他是先进生产者，名字叫何海子日，他的祖父从十五岁当伐木工，一直干到六十八岁头发白了才退休，他的父亲也是伐木工，解放前被万恶的马步芳匪帮打断了腿……
    这时突然从公路右侧传来一阵响亮的歌声：
    林业生产比干劲，
    夺红旗，
    挑战应战加油干哩！
    积极战斗在森林里，
    争上游，
    跃进跃进再跃进哩！……
    那里，十多个青年伐木工正坐在篝火旁，边喝茶边唱着青海花儿哩！那是采伐小组的工人歇下来在喝茶。我和王俊同志向他们走过去，在篝火旁坐下来。乐观而健谈的伐木工人们，一个一个不停的向我们述说生产竞赛情况。听他们的声音，有青海人、河南人、陕西人、四川人，还有广东人……。队长笑着对我说：“我们祁连采伐队的小伙子是来自祖国各地的。他们有的到这里还不到一年，可是很快就习惯了这里寒冷的气候，学会了采伐技术。他们彼此亲如兄弟！如果不是语音的差别，你会完全以为他们都是老青海人哩！”
