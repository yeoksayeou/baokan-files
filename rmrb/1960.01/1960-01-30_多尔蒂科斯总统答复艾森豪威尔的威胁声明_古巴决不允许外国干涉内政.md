Xinhua News Agency, Havana, January 27th - Cuban President Dorticós announced tonight that the Cuban government opposes any attempt by foreign countries to interfere in its internal affairs. He stated, "(Cuba) fully exercises its sovereignty and will never accept or allow any interventionist policies against our country, regardless of whether there are relevant provisions in international treaties."

Dorticós said that the Cuban government is willing to maintain and improve relations with the U.S. government and the American people, but such relations must be based on mutual respect and mutual benefit.

Dorticós's remarks were made at a press conference held at the Presidential Palace tonight in response to Eisenhower's statement regarding Cuba on the 26th. In his remarks, Dorticós pointed out that relations between Cuba and the United States are deteriorating due to a lack of understanding of the Cuban revolution and an insult to the Cuban nation.

Dorticós said that Cuban territory has been subjected to extraordinary bombings time and again, and "all reasonable indications suggest that the aircraft carrying out the bombings appear to have come from U.S. territory." He cited the crimes of aircraft taking off from the United States in October of last year to bomb Cuban sugar mills and the capital Havana, causing many casualties, while the criminal Díaz Lanz still remains at large in the United States.

Cuba has also been attacked by U.S. officials like Nixon, who on January 16th hinted at the possibility of an economic attack on Cuba.

The Cuban President condemned the American newspapers' propaganda against the Cuban revolution, and pointed out that the U.S. government must share the responsibility because it supported the aforementioned propaganda in a formal note to the Cuban government on October 27th of last year.

Dorticós expressed hope that the U.S. government would take appropriate measures to stop Cuban war criminals and criminals who have escaped punishment from continuing to use U.S. territory to carry out anti-Cuban conspiracies and prepare to invade Cuba.

He refuted Eisenhower's claim that the Cuban government was attempting to create a false impression of U.S. aggression and conspiracy. He emphasized that the Cuban government has only responded to threatening and sovereignty-violating statements and to established facts.

He said that Cuba will not confiscate foreign property, but will carry out expropriation "in accordance with the provisions of our constitution and the conditions and methods permitted by our financial situation, with economic compensation."

Dorticós finally categorically rejected Eisenhower's insinuation of a so-called "international communist conspiracy" in Cuba. Dorticós said that the Cuban people have found "their own political, economic, social and cultural expressions."

    多尔蒂科斯总统答复艾森豪威尔的威胁声明
    古巴决不允许外国干涉内政
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　古巴总统多尔蒂科斯今天晚上宣布，古巴政府反对外国任何干涉内政的企图，他说，“（古巴）充分行使主权，决不接受和允许对我国实行任何干涉政策，不管国际条约中是否有有关的规定。”
    多尔蒂科斯说，古巴政府愿意保持和增进同美国政府和美国人民的关系，但是这种关系必须以互相尊重和互利为基础。
    多尔蒂科斯的谈话是今晚在总统府举行的记者招待会上回答艾森豪威尔26日关于古巴的声明时发表的。多尔蒂科斯在谈话中指出，古巴同美国的关系每况愈下，这是对古巴革命缺乏了解和对古巴民族的侮辱造成的。
    多尔蒂科斯说，古巴领土三番五次地遭到异乎寻常的轰炸，“一切合情合理的迹象表明，进行轰炸的飞机像是来自美国领土”。他列举了去年10月从美国起飞的飞机轰炸古巴糖厂和首都哈瓦那并造成许多伤亡的罪行，而罪犯迪亚斯·兰斯却仍然在美国逍遥法外。
    古巴还受到像尼克松这样的美国当权人物的攻击，尼克松1月16日曾暗示有可能从经济上进攻古巴。
    这位古巴总统谴责了美国报纸反对古巴革命的宣传，他指出，美国政府要分担责任，因为它在去年10月27日给古巴政府的正式照会中支持了上述宣传。
    多尔蒂科斯表示希望美国政府采取适当措施，制止古巴的战犯和逃脱制裁的罪犯继续利用美国领土进行反古巴的阴谋活动和准备入侵古巴。
    他驳斥了艾森豪威尔所说的古巴政府企图制造关于美国进行侵略和阴谋活动的错误印象。他强调指出，古巴政府所做的仅限于答复威胁性的和侵犯主权的声明以及确凿的事实。
    他说，古巴不会没收外国财产，而是“根据我国宪法规定和我国财政情况许可的条件和办法进行经济上给予赔偿的”征用。
    多尔蒂科斯最后断然拒绝艾森豪威尔所暗示的古巴有所谓“国际共产主义阴谋”的诬蔑。多尔蒂科斯说，古巴人民已经找到了“他们自己的政治、经济、社会和文化的表现形式”。
