Zheng Zongzan is a Good Veterinarian

In the Shengquan Brigade of the Lidian Commune in Xianyou County, Fujian Province, there is an outstanding young veterinarian named Zheng Zongzan. Over the past three years, he has cured more than 7,600 sick pigs and cattle, earning the love of the masses and being named an advanced worker in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine by the county three times in a row.

Zheng Zongzan is the son of a poor peasant and only studied for three years in elementary school. In 1955, he joined the county's Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Association. During that year, he closely relied on the leadership, humbly learned from senior veterinarians, and after more than a year of study, became a veterinarian in his hometown of Lidian Township. He always considered the interests of the livestock owners. Whenever he discovered a sick pig, he would encourage the owner to leave the animal for treatment. If the owner had difficulties, he would waive the handling fee; if he couldn't cure the pig, he would even waive the medicine fee. At the beginning of his work, he rushed to treat 48 critically ill pigs. The owners of 32 of these pigs thought they couldn't be cured, but he cured them and returned them to the owners, thus winning the praise of the masses. Once, Fu Jinfeng of Lishan Village had a sow that contracted a plague. Upon receiving the news, Zheng Zongzan rushed to rescue it. He made more than ten return visits; during each visit, he personally cooked medicine and fed the pig, finally curing the plague-stricken sow. The owner said to him with emotion: "Ah Zheng, you feed medicine to the sow even more carefully than feeding milk to a child! You are truly a good veterinarian!"

In treating livestock, Zheng Zongzan also implemented the principle of prevention over treatment. In the first half of 1957, he traveled to more than 20 villages in the Maixie and Shexing mountain areas, going door-to-door to promote the benefits of livestock disease prevention and carefully giving pigs vaccinations. Sometimes he ran 60 *li* a day, but he didn't complain at all; for more than 20 days, he got up before dawn and went to bed late at night, carrying out disease prevention work day and night. His enthusiasm for serving the people was loved and welcomed by the people in the mountainous areas. However, Zheng Zongzan was not satisfied with his existing achievements. In 1957, he carried out comprehensive livestock health care and prevention work in the Zhanglin Agricultural Cooperative, promoted livestock health care contracts, and established a livestock hygiene and epidemic prevention system. Because he went deep among the masses, after half a year of hard work, none of the 660 pigs and cattle in the entire cooperative suffered from epidemics, creating the first epidemic-free cooperative in Xianyou County.

    郑宗赞是个好兽医
    福建仙游县赖店公社圣泉大队有个出色的青年兽医郑宗赞，三年来，治好了病猪、病牛七千六百多头，受到了群众的爱戴，连续三次被评为县的畜牧兽医先进工作者。
    郑宗赞是贫农的儿子，只读过三年小学。1955年他便加入了县的畜牧兽医协会。在这一年里，他紧密地依靠领导，虚心向前辈兽医学习，经过一年多的学习，便在家乡赖店乡当兽医。他处处为畜主着想，只要发现病猪，便动员畜主把病畜留下来治疗。畜主有困难的，他免收手续费；如果治不好，连医药费也免收。一开始工作，他就抢治了垂危的病猪四十八头，其中有三十二头病猪，畜主都认为治不好了，但他把它们治好，送还畜主，因此博得了群众的赞扬。有一次，丽山村傅金凤的一只母猪发了瘟，郑宗赞得到消息后，赶忙跑去抢救，他一连复诊十多次；在每次诊治中，亲自动手煮药喂猪，最后终于把这头瘟猪治好。畜主感动地对他说：“阿郑，你给猪母灌药，比给小孩喂奶还细心呀！你真是个好兽医！”
    郑宗赞在给牲畜治疗中，还贯彻了防重于治的方针。在1957年上半年，他走遍了麦斜、社硎山区二十多个乡村，挨家挨户宣传牲畜防疫的好处，细心地替猪打防疫针。有时一天跑六十里路，但他一点不叫苦；有二十多天起三更睡半夜，不分昼夜地进行防疫工作。他这种为人民服务的热情受到了山区群众的爱戴和欢迎。但郑宗赞没有满足已有的成就，1957年，他在樟林农业社开展全面的家畜保健和防治工作，推行了家畜保健合同，订立了家畜卫生防疫制度。由于他深入群众，经过苦战半年，全社六百六十头猪、牛都没有发生瘟病，创造了仙游县第一个无畜疫社。
