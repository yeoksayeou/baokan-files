Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, inheriting and carrying forward the glorious tradition of "holding a gun in one hand and engaging in production with the other," engaged in large-scale agricultural and sideline production in their spare time last year and achieved a bumper harvest. Most units have now achieved basic self-sufficiency in meat and vegetables, and partial self-sufficiency in edible oil. Some units have more than enough for their own needs and can support fraternal units and the national market. This is a major achievement of the people's army in further implementing the spirit of building the army diligently and thriftily and struggling arduously during the period of national socialist construction.

In January of last year, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army issued a call to the entire army to strive for complete self-sufficiency in meat, vegetables, and edible oil within two or three years, which was immediately responded to by the vast number of officers and soldiers. It is a glorious tradition for the people's army to engage in production in their spare time, especially during the Anti-Japanese War, the large-scale production movement carried out by the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army behind enemy lines played a major role in ensuring the victory of the war. Since the liberation of the country, in addition to hundreds of thousands of troops going to Xinjiang, "Beidahuang" in Heilongjiang, the Hexi Corridor and other places to reclaim wasteland and build farms, all units have persisted in agricultural and sideline production, which has been further developed last year. According to incomplete statistics, the cultivated land area last year increased by nearly one times compared with the previous year, vegetable and pork production doubled, oil crops harvested more than 24.44 million catties, and cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, fish, etc. increased by two to nine times, bananas, apples, etc. increased by more than ten times, and more than 5,600 newly opened workshops for flour milling and bean processing have laid a solid foundation for striving for complete self-sufficiency in non-staple food this year.

The agricultural and sideline production of the troops is carried out under the command of the Party committee and the specific organization and leadership of production committees at all levels. Its characteristic is comprehensive blooming, from organs, troops, schools to hospitals, warehouses, from generals, soldiers, staff to family members, everyone takes action and everyone offers suggestions. In the Wuhan area, the amount of vegetables handed over by six generals was more than that handed over by many soldiers, including Major General Hu Huaju, who led the school work, handed over more than 2,300 catties, and Major General Yu Keqin handed over 3,100 catties. On the basis of fully mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses, many difficulties in production have been solved easily. If there is a lack of time, the officers and soldiers will "train during the day and busy with production in the morning and evening;" if there is insufficient cultivated land, the officers and soldiers will reclaim scattered land on the edges of fields, mountains, rivers, roads, and in front of and behind houses under the slogan of "searching for edges and spots, and not wasting an inch of land." In the absence of water sources, the officers and soldiers braved the cold wind and scorching sun, digging rivers by the river, and digging wells and building canals where there were no rivers, so that many vegetable fields were realized water conservancy and gardenification. In the absence of fertilizer, the officers and soldiers used various methods to accumulate fertilizer, and some units also set up small fertilizer plants. If there are not enough tools, they try their best to manufacture them themselves. Over the past year, the troops stationed in Lushun-Dalian have used scrap steel to make more than 11,200 pieces of agricultural tools such as hoes and picks, and built more than 3,700 pigsties and chicken coops with collected waste wood, broken bricks and tiles. Some units have also imitated a batch of tractors and electric water pumps. In the past, the railway engineering corps did not carry out non-staple food production very well because its stationed locations were scattered and its mobility was too great. After the Party Committee of the Railway Engineering Corps issued the call of "producing wherever we build roads," the whole army responded enthusiastically, and the cultivated land area expanded from 900 mu to 4,700 mu in a short period of time, and the number of pigs, cattle, sheep, etc. increased by more than three times. In the past, the naval fleet only carried out fishing activities, but now it can also use the time to go ashore for rest to raise pigs, grow vegetables, and develop non-staple food production.

On the border and coastal defense lines of the motherland, the production of the troops is also carried out in a fighting posture. In the southwestern border areas, many troops have been stationed for many years in sparsely populated, harsh climates, and poor soil high-altitude mountainous areas, and the soldiers have struggled against nature with tenacious will. The crops tried by the soldiers on the Pamir Plateau are sometimes sown in May and frozen to death by heavy snow in June; sometimes, just as they are about to be harvested, a gust of sandstorms knocks down all the crops. The soldiers plant again and again, digging canals themselves without water, and improving the soil themselves if the soil is not good. In order to prevent frost and wind disasters, they make mud bowls and weave strips of baskets to cover the vegetable seedlings in the wind and cold weather. Last year, according to several years of trial planting experience, they opened up a large number of wasteland and planted Chinese cabbage, potatoes, highland barley and other crops, making the ancient wilderness appear as an oasis. A unit stationed in the Kawa Mountain area of Yunnan Province has studied more than 50 kinds of vegetables suitable for local planting according to the unpredictable characteristics of wind, frost, rain and snow, so that they can be sown every month and harvested every season, and they can be self-sufficient in both peak and off-seasons. The Dachun Island in Zhejiang Province has thin soil, many rocks, insufficient water sources, and often has wind and fog. The soldiers use the method of digging ponds in the fields to store rainwater and diverting water from mountain gullies with bamboo pipes to overcome the drought; they use methods such as fencing, building low walls, and planting more soil at the roots to prevent wind damage, and achieved complete self-sufficiency in non-staple food last year. The Third Company of a certain unit planted vegetables, raised pigs, and raised ducks on a deserted island that had never grown crops or trees, and last year it also transported the surplus meat and vegetables back to the mainland to supply the market.

In production, all troops have developed diversified operations in the spirit of adapting to local conditions. Troops stationed in coastal areas have generally organized fishing teams, and some have also used beaches to grow kelp and develop salt fields. Troops stationed in mountainous areas have actively carried out the collection of wild plants and hunting activities, and the game and mushrooms collected by some troops are enough for half a year. In the inland, in addition to giving full play to the "multi-purpose of one thing," combining irrigation, fish farming, pig feed planting, and beautifying the camp area when repairing water ponds, a large number of fruit trees are also planted along the roadsides and ponds. The Inner Mongolia Military Region has used the natural conditions of abundant water and grass to set up livestock farms in the Huiteng River area. A cavalry regiment of a certain unit of the Xinjiang Military Region reclaimed more than 2,000 mu of wasteland on the Gobi Desert, and planted a large number of alfalfa grass while planting wheat, corn, vegetables, etc., to ensure that horse grass is self-sufficient.

The troops' agricultural and sideline production in their spare time not only created wealth for the country and reduced market supply, but also exercised themselves, enabling the vast number of officers and soldiers to learn the necessary production knowledge, and some have become production experts. Officers and soldiers working side by side have further strengthened their mutual love and unity. In border areas and minority areas, the production of the troops has not only improved their lives and changed the face of barren islands, but also taught the experience of planting various crops in the interior to fraternal ethnic groups. After the troops stationed in the Ximeng Mountain area of Yunnan Province successfully planted vegetables, the residents of Kawa and Lahu ethnic groups competed to visit and study, and took the seeds sent to them by the troops back to plant, so that every household in the high-altitude mountainous area could eat green vegetables. The Second Cavalry Company of a certain unit stationed on the Tibetan Plateau, which has always been called "infertile land," tried to grow Chinese cabbage weighing 12 catties and turnips weighing 3 catties. After the vegetables were harvested, the Tibetan people happily came to learn from their experience, get vegetable seeds, and plant them around their tents so that they were lush with green leaves. They said: The army sent by Chairman Mao brought us noble seeds, making our borders more and more beautiful.

    解放军官兵既会打仗又能生产
    大部分部队肉菜基本自给
    新华社讯　中国人民解放军继承和发扬了“一手持枪，一手生产”的光荣传统，去年利用空隙时间进行大规模的农副业生产，获得了大丰收。大部分部队现在已经做到肉、菜基本自给，食油部分自给；个别单位自给有余，还能支援兄弟部队和国家市场。这是人民军队在国家社会主义建设时期进一步贯彻勤俭建军、艰苦奋斗精神的重大成就。
    去年1月，解放军总政治部向全军发出了争取两三年内肉、菜、食油全部自给的号召，广大官兵立即响应。人民军队利用业余时间进行生产，是有光荣传统的，特别是抗日战争时期，八路军、新四军在敌后开展的大生产运动，对保证战争胜利起了重大作用。全国解放以来，除了几十万大军先后到新疆、黑龙江“北大荒”、河西走廊等地垦荒地、建农场以外，各部队都坚持了农副业生产，去年有了更大的发展，据不完全统计，去年耕地面积比前一年扩大了将近一倍，蔬菜、猪肉翻了一番，油料作物收获二千四百四十多万斤，牛、羊、鸡、鸭、鱼等增加了两倍到九倍，香蕉、苹果等增加了十倍以上，新开设的制粉、豆类加工等作坊五千六百多个，为今年争取副食品全部自给打下了稳固基础。
    部队农副业生产是在党委挂帅，各级生产委员会具体组织领导下进行的。它的特点是全面开花，从机关、部队、学校到医院、仓库，从将军、士兵、职工到家属，人人动手，个个献策。武汉地区部队六位将军上缴蔬菜的数量比许多战士上缴的数量还多，其中领导学校工作的胡华居少将缴了二千三百多斤，余克勤少将缴了三千一百多斤。在充分发动群众、依靠群众的基础上，生产中的许多困难迎刃而解，缺少时间，官兵们就“白天搞训练，早晚忙生产”；耕地不足，官兵们在“搜边找点，寸土不荒”的口号下，开垦了田边、山边、河边、路边和屋前宅后的零散土地。缺少水源，官兵们冒着寒风烈日，靠河的挖河，没河的打井、修渠，使许多菜地实现了水利化、园田化。缺乏肥料，官兵们用各种办法积肥，有些单位还办起了小型化肥厂。工具不足，他们又千方百计自己制造。驻旅大部队一年来用废钢铁打出锄、镐等农具一万一千二百多件，用收集来的废木料、碎砖瓦盖猪舍、鸡舍三千七百多间。有些单位还仿造出一批拖拉机、电动抽水机。铁道兵部队过去因为驻地分散、流动性太大，副食品生产没有很好开展。铁道兵党委发出“在哪里修路就在哪里生产”的号召以后，全军上下群起响应，短时间内耕地面积由九百亩扩大到四千七百亩，猪、牛、羊等增加了三倍多。海军舰艇部队过去只进行捕鱼活动，现在也能利用登岸休整时间养猪、种菜，发展副食品生产。
    在祖国边防、海防线上，部队的生产也是以战斗姿态进行的。在西南边疆，许多部队长年驻在人烟稀少，气候恶劣，土质不良的高寒山区，战士们以顽强的意志向自然进行了斗争。帕米尔高原上的战士试种的农作物，有时5月播种，6月一场大雪全部冻死；有时刚要收割，一阵漫天风沙庄稼全被刮倒。战士们一种再种，没有水自己挖渠，土壤不好自己动手改良，为了预防冻害和风灾，他们做泥碗，编条筐，在风里和冷天把蔬菜幼苗盖住。去年他们根据几年来的试种经验，开出大批荒地，种上了大白菜、洋芋和青稞等作物，使万古荒原出现了绿洲。驻云南佧佤山区的一支部队，根据风霜雨雪变化无常的特点，研究出五十多种适于当地栽种的蔬菜，做到月月能下种，季季有收成，不论旺季、淡季都能生产自给。浙江的大陈岛土薄石多，水源不足，还经常刮风下雾，战士们用在田头地边挖池蓄雨水，用竹管从山沟引水等办法战胜了干旱；用扎篱笆、砌矮墙、根部多培土等办法防止了风害，去年做到了副食品全部自给。某部三连在一个从未长过庄稼、树木的荒岛上种菜、养猪、养鸭，去年还把多余的肉、菜运回大陆，供应市场。
    在生产中，各部队都本着因地制宜的精神，发展了多种经营。驻沿海地区的部队普遍组织了捕鱼队，有的还利用海滩种殖海带，开发盐场。驻山区部队积极开展了采集野生植物和打猎活动，有些部队猎取的野味和采集的蘑菇等足够半年食用。在内地，各部队除了充分发挥“一物多用”，在修水塘时，灌溉、养鱼、种植猪饲料和美化营区相结合，路旁、塘边还种植大批果树。内蒙古军区利用水草丰富的自然条件，在灰腾河地区办起了畜牧场。新疆军区某骑兵团在戈壁滩上开垦出两千多亩荒地，在种植小麦、玉米、蔬菜等的同时，种了大批苜蓿草，保证马草自给自足。
    部队利用业余时间进行农副业生产，不仅为国家创造了财富，减少了市场供应，而且也锻炼了自己，使广大官兵学到了必要的生产知识，有些人还成了生产能手。官兵并肩劳动，更加强了相互之间的友爱团结。在边疆和少数民族地区，部队的生产不仅改善了生活，改变了荒原孤岛的面貌，而且把内地多种农作物种植经验传授给兄弟民族。驻云南西盟山区的部队，种植蔬菜成功以后，佧佤、拉祜族的居民争相参观、学习，并把部队送给他们的种籽带回去栽种，使高寒山区家家户户都能吃上青菜。驻藏北高原的某部骑兵二连，在一向被称为“不毛之地”试种出十二斤重的大白菜，三斤重的大蔓菁。蔬菜获得丰收以后，藏族人民欢天喜地地来学经验，取菜籽，把自己帐篷周围种得绿叶繁茂。他们说：毛主席派来的大军，给我们带来了高贵的种籽，使我们的边疆越来越美丽了。
