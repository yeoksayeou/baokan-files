Editor's Note: On January 8th, the Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an article by its observer entitled "The Dangerous Tricks of Japanese Revanchists," commenting on Japan's revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The full text is as follows:

    The Japanese reactionaries are desperately trying to force Japan into a new military alliance with the United States. This alliance threatens not only Japan but also peace in the Far East. Throughout last year, the Japanese ruling clique, under the pressure and support of Washington, worked hard to revise the so-called "Security Treaty" -- the U.S.-Japan military alliance concluded in 1951.
    The progressive forces in Japan have countered with the slogan of striving for Japan's independence, defending peace, and completely abolishing the U.S.-Japan military alliance.
    Millions of working people are fighting against the new U.S.-Japan military alliance. Last November saw one of their most intense clashes with the reactionaries. At that time, thousands of angry demonstrators broke through the police cordon and entered the Diet to express their protest against the "Security Treaty."
    However, the Japanese ruling clique is unwilling to consider the will of the people. Relying on their absolute majority in the Diet, the conservatives overturned the opposition parties' proposal to suspend negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty." On January 6, the negotiations between Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama and U.S. Ambassador MacArthur came to an end. A Japanese government delegation headed by Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi is scheduled to go to Washington on January 16 to sign the new revised treaty.
    At the same time, in order to clear legal obstacles for the conservatives, the Japanese Supreme Court did not hesitate to trample on the constitution and overturned a fair judgment by the Tokyo District Court (referring to the "Sunagawa Case" judgment – translator). This judgment had determined that the U.S.-Japan military alliance and the U.S. troops stationed on Japanese territory were illegal.
    Judging from the speeches of the opposition parties' representatives in the Diet, the essence of the new U.S.-Japan military alliance can be summarized as follows:
    U.S. armed forces will continue to be stationed on Japanese territory for at least the next ten years, and Japan will be used as its base in the Far East. The U.S. command retains the possibility of deploying these troops not only on the Japanese mainland but also throughout the Far East region (after prior consultation with the Japanese government). According to Fujiyama's explanation, this includes, in addition to the Japanese archipelago, the Philippines, Taiwan, the Chinese coastal areas, the Korean Peninsula, and the Soviet Maritime Territory! This treaty actually separates the Okinawa Islands, which have become U.S. military bases, from Japan.
    The important difference between the new treaty and the existing treaty is that the Japanese armed forces must also be involved in the combat operations of the U.S. military on Japanese territory. At the same time, Japan is tasked with further increasing its military potential in order to "negotiate between the two major camps from a position of strength." The new U.S.-Japan treaty violates the peaceful Japanese constitution and stipulates further rearmament of Japan (including nuclear armament), turning Japan into a U.S. atomic arsenal.
    This is the main content of the criticisms raised by opposition party members in both houses of the Diet. These opinions show that Japanese politicians and social figures clearly understand the enormous danger posed to Japan by the reactionary ruling clique's conspiracy. The Japanese press has spoken of this danger. "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out: "Once a war breaks out, Japan will again become a target for ruthless bombing with weapons of mass destruction, because there are U.S. military bases on Japanese territory that should not exist, and because Japanese territory has become a U.S. bridgehead. All this is absolutely incompatible with Japan's security. No matter what its name is, the new security treaty cannot objectively have the nature of a defense alliance."
    It is not difficult to see that the fabrication of the "defensive" nature of the new U.S.-Japan military alliance cannot deceive Japanese public opinion, let alone the public opinion of other countries.
    No one is threatening Japan. The people of Asia clearly understand that the aggression of Japanese militarists always began with talk of "defense."
    The Japanese ruling clique is preparing actions that threaten peace in the Far East. It is acting at a time when, as a result of Khrushchev's historic visit to the United States, the international climate is gradually warming and the ice of the "Cold War" is beginning to melt. This positive change on the international stage is an extremely important event in the past year, and all peace-loving people in the East and West welcome it.
    Unfortunately, Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi does not belong to this group. In his speech in the Diet, he said as if "the view that the international situation will thaw quickly due to Soviet Premier Khrushchev's visit to the United States does not conform to the actual situation on the international stage." It is as if the entire company's steps are disordered, and only Kishi Nobusuke's steps are aligned!
    Prime Minister Kishi's words have only one purpose: to defend his planned "Cold War" actions, to defend the arms race, and to defend turning Japan into a U.S. atomic rocket base. Socialist Party Secretary-General Asanuma called Kishi Nobusuke's statement "irresponsible."
    "Yomiuri Shimbun" wrote: "If Japan does not now transition from a policy of 'contradiction' with communist countries to a policy of 'friendship and cooperation' with them, it may fall behind international events. In view of this situation, a certain panic has emerged among important business figures who understand the inside story of the Kishi Nobusuke government." In recent weeks, important figures in the Liberal Democratic Party such as Tanzan Ishibashi, Kenzo Matsumura, and Takeo Miki have advocated changing the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's militaristic foreign policy line.
    There is a famous Japanese proverb that says: "Letting a wolf into the house will bring disaster to the whole house." By introducing U.S. armed forces into Japan, the Japanese ruling clique has caused Japan to lose its independence and has trampled on the Japanese people's desire for peace. The struggle of Japanese patriots against the military collusion between the reactionary ruling class and the United States is growing in scale.
    The actions of the Japanese ruling clique, which run counter to the current improvement in the international situation and directly threaten peace in the Far East, cannot but arouse the close attention of Japan's neighbors and all those who desire the relaxation of international tensions and the consolidation of peace and security for the people of all countries.

    日本复仇主义者的危险把戏
    编者按　苏联“真理报”8日刊登了该报观察家一篇题为“日本复仇主义者的危险把戏”的文章，评日本修改日美“安全条约”。全文如下：
    日本反动派正在拼命地企图强使日本同美国结成新的军事同盟。这一同盟不仅威胁着日本，而且威胁远东的和平。在去年的一整年里，日本统治集团在华盛顿的压力和支持下，竭力准备修改所谓“安全条约”——1951年缔结的美日军事同盟。
    日本的进步力量提出争取日本独立、保卫和平和完全铲除日美军事同盟的口号，予以反击。
    千百万劳动人民为反对新的日美军事同盟而斗争。去年11月发生了他们同反动派的一次最激烈的冲突。当时成千上万愤怒的示威者，冲破警察的封锁线进入国会，以表示自己对“安全条约”的抗议。
    但是，日本统治集团不愿意考虑人民的意志。保守党人依靠在国会中的绝对多数，推翻了在野党要求中止修改“安全条约”谈判的提案。1月6日日本外相藤山同美国大使麦克阿瑟举行的这种谈判宣告结束。以岸信介首相为首的日本政府代表团定于1月16日赴华盛顿签署新的修改后的条约。
    同时，为了替保守党人扫除法律上的障碍，日本最高法院不惜践踏宪法，取消了东京地方法院的一项公正判决（指“砂川事件”判决——译者）。这项判决曾认定日美军事同盟及驻在日本国土上的美军为非法。
    从国会内在野党代表们的发言来看，新的日美军事同盟的实质可以归结如下：
    美国武装力量至少在最近十年内还要驻在日本的领土上，并且把日本当作它在远东的根据地。美国统帅部保有这样的可能，即不仅在日本本土上，而且在整个远东地区出动这些军队（在同日本政府事先协商之后）。按照藤山的解释，这除了日本列岛外还包括菲律宾、台湾、中国沿海地区、朝鲜半岛和苏联滨海边区！这项条约实际上把已变成美国军事基地的冲绳群岛从日本分割出来。
    新条约同现行条约的重要区别在于，日本武装力量还必须卷进美军在日本领土上的战斗行动。同时，在日本面前提出了进一步增加军事潜力的任务，以便“从实力地位出发进行两大阵营的谈判”。新的日美条约破坏了和平的日本宪法，并规定要进一步重新武装日本（包括核武装在内），把日本变成美国的原子武器库。
    在野党议员在国会两院提出的主要批评意见的内容就是这样。这些意见说明，日本政界和社会人士清楚地了解到反动统治集团的阴谋给日本造成的巨大危险。日本报刊说到了这种危险性。“朝日新闻”指出：“一旦爆发战争，日本又将成为以大规模毁灭手段进行无情轰炸的目标，因为在日本国土上有早就不该存在的美国军事基地，因为日本国土成了美军的桥头堡。这一切都是同日本的安全绝对不相容的。新的安全条约不管它的名称叫做什么，在客观上也绝不能具有防卫同盟的性质。”
    不难看出，胡诌新的日美军事同盟的“防卫”性质，欺骗不了日本的社会舆论，更不要说其他国家的社会舆论了。
    没有任何人在威胁日本。亚洲人民清楚地了解，日本军国主义者的侵略在过去总是从谈论“防卫”开始的。
    日本统治集团在准备威胁远东和平的行动。它是在这样的时机行事的，即由于赫鲁晓夫的具有历史意义的访美结果，国际气候逐渐转暖，“冷战”冰块开始溶解。国际舞台上的这一良好的变化，是过去一年内极为重要的事件，东西方一切珍爱和平的人们都对此表示欢迎。
  可惜，岸信介首相并不属于这种人。他在国会的演说中说，仿佛“认为由于苏联总理赫鲁晓夫访问美国就会很快解冻的说法是不符合国际舞台的实际情况的”。好像是整个连队的步伐都是凌乱的，唯有岸信介一个人步调整齐哩！
    日本首相的话只有一个目的：为他所策划的“冷战”行动作辩护，为军备竞赛和把日本变成美国原子火箭基地作辩护。社会党书记长浅沼把岸信介的这种说法叫做“不负责任”。
      “读卖新闻”写道：“如果日本现在不从同共产主义国家‘矛盾’的政策过渡到‘同它们亲善合作’的政策，它就有可能落在国际事件的后头。鉴于这种情况，国内了解岸信介政府内幕的重要实业界人士中间出现了某种张惶失措的情形。”最近几周来，像石桥湛山、松村谦三、三木武夫等这样一些自由民主党的重要人士，都主张改变岸信介内阁的穷兵黩武的外交路线。
    日本有一句著名的谚语说：“引狼入室——全屋遭殃”。日本统治集团把美国武装力量引进日本，因而使日本丧失独立，并使日本人民的和平意愿遭到蹂躏。日本爱国者为反对反动上层统治集团同美国的军事勾结而进行的斗争，具有越来越大的规模。
    日本统治集团同当前国际局势改善背道而驰、并直接威胁远东和平的行动，不能不引起日本邻国，以及所有渴望国际紧张局势缓和与巩固各国人民和平和安全的人们的密切注意。
