Respected Vice Premier Rau, Respected Ambassador Wang, Respected Comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, Comrades, Friends:

Our respected guest, Vice Premier Heinrich Rau, and all the comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic are about to leave our country after a visit of nearly ten days. On this eve of parting, we are particularly pleased to have the opportunity to gather once again with the comrades of the delegation. The visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic to our country has made an important contribution to enhancing mutual understanding and fraternal friendship between our two countries. The signing of the Sino-German Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and the Sino-German Government Agreement on the Exchange of Goods from 1960 to 1962 this afternoon marks a further development of the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries. I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Chinese Government and people, to express our most heartfelt gratitude to our respected guests.

Both of our countries are peace-loving countries. We are pleased to see that, thanks to the joint efforts of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, the current international situation has eased to a certain extent. Recently, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, based on the proposal of Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, adopted the Law on Another Reduction of 1.2 Million Armed Forces and the Appeal to the Parliaments and Governments of All Countries. This is another major effort made by the Soviet government for universal disarmament following the Declaration and Proposal on Complete and Thorough Disarmament submitted to the United Nations General Assembly on September 18, 1959. The Soviet Union's action powerfully demonstrates the sincere desire of the Soviet government and people to strive for peace and their unparalleled confidence in their own strength, and has been praised and hailed by all peace-loving people in the world. The Chinese government and people warmly welcome and actively support this peaceful measure of the Soviet Union and believe that it will have a significant impact on further easing international tensions.

However, people cannot but be vigilant to note that the US ruling clique, under the guise of "peace," has not abandoned its policies of war and aggression in the slightest. They are doing their best to obstruct disarmament negotiations, stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, and clamoring to resume nuclear weapons testing at any time. It is particularly worth noting that in Europe, the United States is still insisting on pursuing a policy of splitting Germany and reviving West German militarism, making West Germany the most aggressive force and the main hotbed of war in Europe; in Asia, the United States is stepping up military collusion with Japan and preparing to sign a military alliance treaty with the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government on the 19th of this month. It is quite obvious that the establishment of the US-Japan military alliance is a sign of the revival of Japanese militarism and Japan's open participation in the US aggressive military bloc, and it is also an extremely serious step by the United States to encircle China and the Soviet Union, threaten Asian countries, and intensify tensions in the Far East. These actions of the United States thoroughly expose its tactic of "fake peace, real war preparation." The peace forces of the whole world must be wary of the American conspiracy and make unremitting efforts to defeat new American aggression and expansion activities.

Our two countries have always cooperated closely and supported each other in the struggle against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace. The Chinese government and people resolutely oppose the US's criminal activities of reviving West German and Japanese militarism and preparing for new wars. The Chinese government and people resolutely support the rational proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic for concluding peace treaties with the two Germanys and resolving the West Berlin issue, and believe that, in resolving issues related to Germany, the German Democratic Republic, which has consistently safeguarded the interests of the German people and European peace, is fully entitled to send representatives to participate. The Chinese people are convinced that the German people's struggle for national reunification and defense of European security will surely achieve final victory with the support of peace-loving countries and peoples throughout the world.

Comrades, friends, I propose:

    For the further vigorous development of the socialist construction cause of the German Democratic Republic,
    For the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Germany,
    For the unity of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
    For world peace,
    For the health of Vice Premier Rau and his wife and all the comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic,
    For the health of Ambassador Wang and his wife,
    For the health of President Pieck and Comrade Ulbricht,
    Cheers!

### 李先念副总理的讲话

专栏：

    李先念副总理的讲话敬爱的劳副总理同志，敬爱的汪戴尔大使同志，敬爱的德意志民主共和国政府代表团的全体同志，同志们，朋友们：
    我们敬爱的贵宾海因里希·劳副总理和德意志民主共和国政府代表团的全体同志，在我国进行了将近十天的访问，即将离开我国。在这临别的前夕，我们能有机会再一次同代表团的同志们欢聚一堂，感到特别高兴。德意志民主共和国政府代表团这次来我国访问，对于增进我们两国的相互了解和兄弟友谊作出了重要的贡献。今天下午签字的中德通商航海条约和中德两国政府关于1960年到1962年交换货物协定标志着我们两国的友好合作关系的进一步发展。我愿借此机会，代表中国政府和人民，对我们敬爱的贵宾们表示最衷心的感谢。
    我们两国都是爱好和平的国家。我们高兴地看到由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民的共同努力，目前的国际局势已经有了一定的缓和。最近，苏联最高苏维埃会议根据苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志的建议，通过了再一次裁减一百二十万武装部队的法律和致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书。这是苏联政府继1959年9月18日向联合国大会提出关于全面彻底裁军的宣言和建议以后，对于普遍裁军所作出的又一次重大努力。苏联的这一行动，有力地证明了苏联政府和人民对于争取和平的真诚愿望和对于自己力量的无比信心，受到了世界上所有爱好和平的人民的赞扬和欢呼。中国政府和人民热烈欢迎和积极支持苏联的这一和平措施，并且相信这必将对进一步缓和国际紧张局势，发生重大的影响。
    但是，人们不能不警惕地注意到，美国统治集团在“和平”的伪装下，丝毫也没有放弃它的战争和侵略政策。他们正在竭力阻挠裁军谈判，加紧扩军备战，并且扬言随时要恢复核武器试验。特别值得注意的是，在欧洲，美国仍在坚持推行分裂德国和复活西德军国主义的政策，使西德成为欧洲最富于侵略性的势力和主要的战争温床；在亚洲，美国正在加紧同日本进行军事勾结，准备在本月19日同日本岸信介政府签订一项军事同盟条约。十分明显，美日军事同盟的成立，是日本军国主义复活和日本公然参加美国的侵略性军事集团的标志，同时也是美国包围中苏、威胁亚洲各国和加剧远东紧张局势的一个极其严重的步骤。美国的这些行动彻底暴露了它“假和平，真备战”的手法，全世界的和平力量必须提防美国的阴谋，并且为击败美国新的侵略和扩张活动进行坚持不懈的努力。
    我们两国在反对帝国主义侵略和维护世界和平的斗争中一向密切合作，互相支持。中国政府和人民坚决反对美国复活西德和日本军国主义和准备新战争的罪恶活动。中国政府和人民坚决支持苏联和德意志民主共和国所提出的同两个德国缔结和约和解决西柏林问题的合理建议，并且认为，在解决有关德国问题时，作为一贯维护德国人民利益和欧洲和平的德意志民主共和国完全有权派代表参加。中国人民确信，德国人民争取祖国统一、保卫欧洲安全的斗争，在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，一定会取得最后的胜利。
    同志们，朋友们，我建议：
    为德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设事业进一步蓬勃发展，
    为中德两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊，
    为以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的团结，
    为世界和平，
    为劳副总理和夫人以及德意志民主共和国政府代表团全体同志的健康，
    为汪戴尔大使同志和夫人的健康，
    为皮克总统和乌布利希同志的健康，
    干杯！（附图片）
