    Singing the Old Tune in the New Year
    Soviet Union, Sergeyev

    As in all other places, people in Japan are preparing to welcome 1960. They are eager to greet the New Year in a new situation, placing their hopes on the future. However, the rulers of Japan have a different mood. They reminisce about the past, filled with worries. They enter the New Year with old ideas. They still hope to reap profits from the arms race and war preparations.

    Recently, a delegation from Tokyo went to Washington to sign the Japan-U.S. military treaty. The Japanese government believes this treaty is of extremely great significance; therefore, Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi decided to personally lead the delegation.

    The Japanese people believe that signing this treaty is the most disgraceful act of the ruling group in the entire post-war history of Japan. This military treaty, which will replace the existing "Security Treaty," stipulates the intensification of Japan's militarization, turning Japan into an American atomic base, and automatically making Japan stand on the side of the United States in any military conflict in the Far East. This treaty is more dangerous than the previous treaty.

    The Japanese people suffered tremendous sacrifices after World War II. The Japanese ruling group is unwilling to accept the lessons of the past. They stubbornly cling to outdated and useless policies that once brought tragedy to Japan. They are also indifferent to the fact that the current world situation has significantly eased. Akagi, Director-General of the Japanese Defense Agency, recently admitted that international tensions have eased as a result of Khrushchev's visit to the United States. However, he said that Japan will continue to arm itself.

    Japan's armed forces now number nearly 220,000, including 170,000 in the army, 28,000 in the navy, and more than 20,000 in the air force. In terms of firepower, the current Japanese army is many times larger than the former Imperial Army when it invaded Manchuria.

    The speed of fleet restoration is no less than that of the army. New warships are continuously being manufactured in Japanese shipyards. The total displacement of the Japanese fleet's warships reaches 100,000 tons. The air force is also growing daily. They are equipped with modern jet machinery. On November 10th of last year, the Japanese government decided to adopt American ultrasonic Lockheed F-104-C jet fighters in terms of armaments. Interestingly, the person who chose this fighter was Minoru Genda, the chief of staff of the Japanese Air Force who participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor, the main base of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, as a pilot in 1941. According to the "Mainichi Shimbun," the Japanese Air Force has more than 1,000 aircraft. With the use of new fighters, Japan's air power will be further enhanced. Japanese companies will also participate in the production of this aircraft.

    Japan's military expenditure is increasing year by year. According to "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," military expenditure in 1953 was 61 billion yen, while in 1959 it was 136 billion yen. In the next fiscal year, military appropriations are expected to be 183 billion yen, which is twice as much as in 1953.

    A second "Defense Plan" is being hastily formulated, which is planned to be implemented in 1965. In the final year of implementing this plan, Japan's military budget will reach 290 billion yen.

    The main forces of the Japanese militarist group are concentrated on equipping the army with rocket weapons and nuclear weapons. Military industrial monopolists have sensed that there will be huge profits in the future and intend to accept military orders. The production of the latest weapons has a solid foundation all of a sudden. Six major companies have formed scientific research groups to study and produce missiles. The "Mainichi Shimbun" wrote that the "Defense Industry Research Committee" led by Japanese capitalist Kamimura has formulated a long-term plan to produce warships, aircraft, missiles, and other modern weapons. According to this plan, Japan's military industry will increase threefold. According to the "Japan Times," some companies and associations have already begun trial production of missiles.

    In order to accelerate the rearmament of the army with various new weapons, Japan is purchasing missiles from the United States and other countries.

    The Japanese authorities are trying to defend the war preparations and the conclusion of a new treaty with the United States by using the excuse of "the threat of communism" and the need to defend Japan's "national defense." This is a cliché! This is hypocritical and foolish. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the creators of these clichés to deceive the people. The Kishi Nobusuke government's policies have aroused increasing anger among the Japanese public.

    A movement against the conclusion of a new military treaty with the United States is being carried out throughout the country. Even some people in the ruling group are gradually beginning to understand the danger of this treaty. For example, former Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Nishiharu Hikaru, said in an interview with the "Japan Times": "If we look at the issue of revising the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty from the perspective of Japan's relations with the Soviet Union and China, then revising the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is a huge danger to Japan. Now, when the signs of the 'Cold War' turning warmer are becoming more and more obvious, it is not appropriate to conclude this treaty. Japan should do its best to improve relations with communist countries... Never forget the lessons of the last world war."

    Japanese military commentator Takahashi has a sober view on this issue in his book "War in the Missile Age and Japan's Self-Defense Forces." He wrote that once a war breaks out, Japan will inevitably be retaliated against. Arming the Japanese army with missiles and setting up American military bases on Japanese territory can in no way be in the interests of the Japanese people.

    Takahashi concluded that the only way to ensure the safety of Japan and the Japanese people is the path of neutrality.

    Japan should refuse to conclude a military alliance with the United States, refuse dangerous war preparations, and embark on the path of independence and neutrality. This is the demand of all wise people in Japan.

    新年唱老调
    苏联　谢尔盖耶夫
    和在所有其他地方一样，在日本，人们也在准备迎接1960年。他们很想在新的形势中迎接新年，对未来寄予希望。但是，日本的统治者的心情却不同。他们缅怀往昔，忧心忡忡。他们带着旧的念头进入新年。他们仍旧希望从军备竞赛和备战中猎取利润。
    最近，一个代表团从东京前去华盛顿签定日美军事条约。日本政府认为这个条约具有极其重大的意义，因此，岸信介首相决定亲自出马率领代表团。
    日本人民认为签定这个条约，是统治集团在日本战后全部历史中最可耻的举动。将用来代替现有“安全条约”的这个军事条约规定加紧日本的军国主义化，把日本变成美国的原子基地，使日本自动地站在美国一面参加远东的任何军事冲突。这个条约比过去的条约更加危险。
    第二次世界大战后日本人民遭到巨大的牺牲。日本统治集团不肯接受过去的教训。他们死啃住曾一度使日本遭到悲惨下场的、过时的、毫无好处的政策不放。目前世界形势有了显著和缓，对这一事实他们也无动于衷。日本防卫厅长官赤城不久前承认，由于赫鲁晓夫访问美国的结果，国际紧张局势出现了缓和的局面。但是，他说，日本将继续进行武装。
    现在日本武装力量将近二十二万人，其中陆军为十七万人，海军为二万八千人，空军为二万多人。现今的日本军队就其火力来说，要比过去的皇军在侵略满洲时大好几倍。
    舰队恢复的速度也不逊于陆军。新的军舰源源不断地从日本造船厂制造出来。日本舰队军舰的总排水量达到十万吨。空军力量也在日益增长。它们是用现代化喷气式机械装备起来的。去年11月10日日本政府决定在军备方面采用美国超声波的洛克希德F—104—C喷气式歼击机。有趣的是，选择这种歼击机的是在1941年以飞行员的身份参加袭击美国太平洋舰队的主要基地珍珠港的日本空军幕僚长源田实。据“每日新闻报”资料，日本空军拥有一千多架飞机。随着新式歼击机的使用，日本的空军力量将更加增强。日本的公司也将参加这种飞机的生产。
    日本的军费一年比一年增加。据“日本新闻”的资料，1953年的军费为六百一十亿日元，而1959年则为一千三百六十亿日元。在明年的财政年度，预计军事拨款为一千八百三十亿日元，即比1953年多两倍。
    正在急忙制定第二个“防御计划”，这个计划打算在1965年实现。在实现这个计划的最后一年，日本的军事预算将达到两千九百亿日元。
    日本军国主义集团的主要力量是集中在用火箭武器和核武器装备军队方面。军火工业垄断资本已感到将来定有巨额利润，因而打算接受军火订货。生产最新式武器的事一下子就有了坚实的基础。六家大公司成立了研究和生产导弹的科学研究小组。“每日新闻报”写道，日本大资本家上村领导的“国防工业研究委员会”制定了一项生产军舰、飞机、导弹和其他现代化武器的长期计划。根据这个计划，日本的军事工业将增加两倍。据“日本时报”报道，某些公司和协会已经开始进行导弹的试生产了。
    为了加速用各种新式武器重新武装军队，日本正在向美国和其他国家购买导弹。
    日本当局企图用“共产主义的威胁”和必须保卫日本“国防”的借口来替备战和同美国缔结新条约一事进行辩护。这是陈词滥调！这是虚伪的和愚蠢的。这些陈词滥调的创造者现在越来越难于欺骗人民。岸信介政府的政策引起日本公众越来越大的愤怒。
    全国各地都在开展反对同美国缔结新军事条约的运动。就是统治集团中的某些人士也逐渐开始懂得这个条约的危险性。例如，前日本驻英国大使西春彦向“日本时报”发表谈话时说：“如果从日本同苏联和中国的关系的观点来看修改日美安全条约这个问题，那么，修改日美安全条约这件事对日本是一个巨大危险。现在，当“冷战”转暖的迹象越来越表现得明显的时候，缔结这个条约是不适宜的。日本应该尽自己的努力来改善同共产主义国家的关系……决不要忘记最近一次世界大战的教训”。
    日本军事评论员高桥在“导弹时代的战争与日本自卫力量”一书中对这个问题有清醒的看法。他写道，一旦发生战争，日本必定要受到回击。用导弹武装日本军队和在日本领土上设置美国军事基地，无论如何不能符合日本人民的利益。
    高桥最后说，保证日本和日本人民的安全的唯一的道路是中立的道路。
    日本应该拒绝同美国缔结军事联盟、拒绝危险的备战，走上独立和中立的道路，这就是日本所有明智的人的要求。
