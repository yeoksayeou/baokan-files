Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, January 17th. Yi Mingyuan, a young worker at the Sansui Chemical Plant in Zhenyuan County, Guizhou Province, has successfully experimented with extracting gasoline, diesel, and kerosene from tung oilseed cake and tea seed cake after the oil has been pressed out. The extracted gasoline and diesel have been tested by relevant departments and in actual driving, proving that they can replace natural gasoline and general diesel fuel. Currently, the people's communes in Zhenyuan County have used Yi Mingyuan's method to produce more than 50 tons of mixed oil for refining gasoline, diesel, and kerosene.

Yi Mingyuan is a studious and deeply inquisitive young worker. Not long ago, he was greatly inspired when reading the book "Using Indigenous Methods to Manufacture Forest Chemical Products." He believed that since liquid fuels can be extracted from pine wood, and tung oilseed cake and tea seed cake contain oil and are carbohydrates, it should also be possible to extract liquid fuels from them. He told the factory's Party organization about his idea, and it received the Party organization's support, which also assigned a special person to assist him with the experiment. After several failures, he finally succeeded in the experiment. They extracted more than 20 jin of mixed oil from 100 jin of tung oilseed cake, from which they extracted approximately 15% gasoline, 35% kerosene, and 50% diesel.

The method of extracting gasoline, diesel, and kerosene from tung oilseed cake and tea seed cake is simple and easy to implement. Simply process the oil cake into powder, use an external heating dry distillation method to extract the mixed oil, and then heat and distill the mixed oil to separate gasoline, kerosene, and diesel at different temperatures. The residue remaining after extracting the mixed oil is also a very good fertilizer.

Zhenyuan County is rich in tung and tea woody oilseeds, producing more than 9,000 tons of tung oilseed cake and tea seed cake annually. If all these oil cakes are fully utilized, at least thousands of tons of synthetic gasoline, diesel, and kerosene can be produced each year. Gasoline and diesel alone could supply forty cars for a year. The Zhenyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to promote this experience throughout the county and to establish mixed oil processing plants in the Sansui, Cengong, and Qingxi areas to refine the mixed oil produced by the communes into gasoline, diesel, and kerosene.

    青年工人易明远创造新法
    从桐子饼和茶子饼中提炼出汽油柴油煤油
    新华社贵阳17日电　贵州省镇远县三穗化工厂青年工人易明远，试用榨过油的桐子饼、茶子饼提制汽油、柴油、煤油成功。提炼出的汽油和柴油，经有关部门化验和实际开车试验，证明能代替天然汽油和一般柴油使用。目前，镇远县各人民公社已利用易明远的方法，生产出混合油五十多吨，供提制汽油、柴油、煤油用。
    易明远是一个好学深钻的青年工人。不久以前，他在阅读“土法制造林化产品”一书时受到很大启发，他认为松木材能提出液体燃料，桐子饼、茶子饼含有油分，是炭水化合物，也应该可以提取液体燃料。他把这个想法告诉工厂党组织，得到了党组织的支持，党组织并派专人协助他试验。经过几次失败，终于试验成功。他们从一百斤桐子饼中提炼出混合油二十多斤，从混合油中提出约15％的汽油，35％的煤油，50％的柴油。
    用桐子饼和茶子饼提制汽油、柴油、煤油的方法简便易行。只要把枯饼加工成粉末，用外热式干馏法提出混合油，再将混合油加热蒸馏，就可以在不同温度下分离出汽油、煤油、柴油。提取混合油剩下的渣滓，还是一种很好的肥料。
    镇远县盛产桐、茶木本油料，年产桐子饼和茶子饼九千吨以上。如果把这些油饼全部利用起来，每年至少可以生产人造汽油、柴油、煤油上千吨，仅汽油和柴油就可以供四十辆汽车用一年。中共镇远县委已确定在全县推广这一经验，并且在三穗、岑巩、青溪三个地区建立混合油加工厂，将各公社生产的混合油提炼成汽油、柴油和煤油。
