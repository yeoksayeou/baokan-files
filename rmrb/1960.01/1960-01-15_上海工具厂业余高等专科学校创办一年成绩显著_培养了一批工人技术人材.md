    Shanghai Tool Factory's Amateur Higher Vocational School Achieves Remarkable Results in its First Year
    Cultivating a Group of Worker Technical Talents
    (Our report) The amateur higher vocational school established by the Shanghai Tool Factory during the Great Leap Forward in 1958 has seen great development over the past year. Currently, there are more than 180 employees studying in the first and second grades of this amateur university, accounting for 13% of the total number of employees participating in amateur studies, which is more than three times the number at the beginning of its establishment. This school insists on combining teaching with production and scientific research activities, and has now become an important base in the factory for improving the technical level of workers.
    The Shanghai Tool Factory has been running amateur education since 1952. Initially, literacy classes were conducted, and amateur primary and junior high schools were established. In 1956, amateur secondary vocational schools and junior technical schools were also opened. During the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958, the entire factory engaged in technical revolution, especially in the research and trial production of some advanced and precise tools, where the quantity and quality of engineering and technical personnel could not keep up with the needs, and the cultural and technical level of workers urgently needed to be improved. However, the existing amateur schools could not meet this demand. The Party Committee proposed the goal of combining production, learning, and scientific research activities, boldly reforming the teaching content of amateur secondary vocational schools, junior high schools, and primary schools, and at the same time established an amateur higher vocational school.
    After the amateur higher vocational school was established, the first problem encountered was the lack of teachers. At that time, in addition to a teacher from the amateur secondary vocational school teaching the basic technical course of mechanical drawing, other courses such as theoretical mechanics were initially taught by engineering and technical personnel on a part-time basis, and political courses were taught by responsible comrades within the factory at the invitation of the factory Party Committee. At the same time, three cadres with university degrees were transferred from the offices to participate in the teaching and research group work, while also going to relevant majors at Jiaotong University for further study. By 1959, they were all able to teach the main courses of each class separately.
    Regarding the academic system, professional settings, and curriculum content of the amateur higher vocational school, the school conducted repeated research under the leadership of the factory Party Committee. They proceeded from the actual production of the factory, and based on the characteristic that 70% of the entire factory were young workers, the teaching was made to serve current production while also taking into account systematic improvement, and a consistent system of higher vocational and secondary vocational education was adopted, opening sixteen courses. The advantage of adopting a consistent system of secondary vocational and higher vocational education is that it can avoid the repetition of courses studied in these two stages, and make the focus of higher vocational courses more prominent. The teaching of each course implemented the principle of systematic classroom lectures and close integration with reality.
    After more than a year of study, the theoretical and operational levels of the students have been significantly improved. Process technician Li Yongyuan and technicians Zhao Dingsen and Wang Yougang in the experimental workshop are all studying in the first and second grades of the higher vocational school. Together with two engineers (who are also part-time teachers of higher mathematics and theoretical mechanics), they designed and successfully trial-produced a "small drill automatic assembly line" consisting of nine machine tools, improving production efficiency. In each workshop, more workers, due to the gradual increase in theoretical knowledge, calculated precisely in operation, and the rate of substandard and defective products was greatly reduced. Zhao Kechang, a young worker in the second workshop, produced small hobs for watches and instrument gears, with specifications that could not differ by one-thousandth of a millimeter (one-seventieth of a hair). Because he studied courses such as cutting principles, he mastered the technology better and basically never produced defective products.

    上海工具厂业余高等专科学校创办一年成绩显著
    培养了一批工人技术人材
    本报讯　上海工具厂1958年大跃进中举办的业余高等专科学校，一年多来有了很大的发展。目前在这所业余大学一、二年级学习的职工共有一百八十多人，等于全厂参加业余学习人数的13％，比创办初期增加了三倍以上。这所学校坚持结合生产、科学研究活动进行教学，现已成为工厂中提高工人技术水平的重要据点。
    上海工具厂从1952年起举办业余教育。开始是进行扫盲，并举办业余小学和初中，1956年又开设业余中等专科学校和初等技术学校。1958年生产大跃进中，全厂大闹技术革命，特别是在研究试制一些高级、精密的工具中，工程技术人员的数量和质量都赶不上需要，工人的文化技术水平迫切需要提高。可是，当时的业余学校不能满足这种要求。党委提出了生产、学习、科学研究活动三结合的目标，大胆改革业余中专、初中、小学的教学内容，同时创办了业余高等专科学校。
    业余高等专科学校办起来后，首先碰到的问题是缺乏师资。当时除机械制图基础技术课有一个业余中专的教师担任以外，其他像理论力学等课，都先由工程技术人员兼任，政治课由工厂党委请厂内负责同志担任。同时，从科室中抽调三个具有大学毕业程度的干部，让他们一面参加教研组工作，一面去交通大学有关专业进修。到1959年，他们都已能分别担任讲授各班的主要课程。
    对于业余高等专科学校的学制、专业设置、课程内容，在工厂党委领导下，学校进行了反复研究。他们从工厂生产实际出发，并根据全厂有70％是青年工人的特点，使教学既为当前生产服务，又照顾到系统提高，并采取高专、中专一贯制，开设了十六门课程。采取中专、高专一贯制的好处是，可以避免这两个阶段学习的课程重复，并使高专的课程重点突出。各科课程的教学，都实行了课堂系统讲授和密切结合实际的原则。
    经过一年多的学习，学员的理论和操作水平都有显著提高。试验车间工艺员李永源和技术员赵鼎森、王幼刚等，都在高专一、二年级读书，他们同两个工程师（也是高等数学和理论力学的兼职教师）一起，设计和试制成功了一项包括有九台机床组成的“小钻头自动流水线”，提高了生产效率。各车间都有更多的工人，由于理论知识逐步增长，在操作中计算精密，次废品率大大降低。第二车间青工赵克昌生产的手表、仪表齿轮用的小滚刀，规格不能相差千分之一毫米，（一根头发的七十分之一），由于他读了切削原理等课程，更好地掌握了技术，基本上没有出过废品。
