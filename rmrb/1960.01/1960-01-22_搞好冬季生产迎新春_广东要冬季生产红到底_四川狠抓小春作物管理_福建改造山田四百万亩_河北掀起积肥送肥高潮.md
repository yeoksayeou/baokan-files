　　Do a Good Job in Winter Production to Welcome the New Year
　　Guangdong Wants Winter Production to be Red to the End　Sichuan Focuses on the Management of Spring Crops  Fujian Transforms Four Million Mu of Mountain Fields　Hebei Launches a High Tide of Accumulating and Delivering Fertilizer

Guangdong
　　This newspaper reports that winter production in Guangdong Province is progressing very well. Leaders at all levels throughout the province are building on this victory by organizing a comprehensive inspection of rural work to ensure that winter production remains "red to the end."
　　Winter production in Guangdong Province started early and progressed rapidly. As early as October last year, the province organized 1.5 million laborers to start construction on key water conservancy projects ahead of schedule. During the busy autumn harvest in November, the province adopted the method of harvesting, plowing, and planting simultaneously. By the end of November, the autumn harvest was completed, and the winter planting plan was also announced as completed. Starting in December, the province focused on large-scale water conservancy projects, combined with deep plowing to improve the soil and accumulate fertilizer, and comprehensively carried out farmland infrastructure construction. Currently, the amount of earthwork completed for water conservancy projects throughout the province is three times that of the same period last year. Eighteen thousand medium and small-sized water conservancy projects have been completed, and 120 key projects benefiting more than 10,000 mu have been completed. The plan to expand the deep plowing area by 10 million mu has been completed for more than 9.2 million mu, with general deep plowing reaching six inches or more, and key improvements made to more than 2 million mu of backward fields. More than 6.6 billion dan of various natural fertilizers have been accumulated, averaging more than 120 dan per mu for the province's more than 50 million mu of cultivated land. The pig-raising industry is also growing month by month, with a total of 170,000 pig farms at the commune, brigade, team, and canteen levels throughout the province. The cash income from winter sideline production has reached more than 425 million yuan, averaging more than 10 yuan per agricultural worker.
　　The province will comprehensively promote the experience of early sowing and transplanting, and has decided to start sowing this year at the beginning of spring and end transplanting before the Qingming Festival, striving for stable and high yields of early rice. Due to the early start and rapid progress of preparatory work centered on water, soil, and fertilizer, the province has gained greater initiative in spring sowing and transplanting. Currently, farmers in various places have begun soaking seeds and preparing seedbeds to welcome a "red start" to spring sowing after the Spring Festival.

Sichuan
　　This newspaper reports that Sichuan is focusing on field management of spring grain crops, striving to achieve "half a year's grain from spring crops."
　　The field management campaign for spring grain crops in Sichuan is centered on wheat. Many places organized specialized teams before the end of sowing, planned the timing of the blitz campaign, and prepared tools and materials, implementing the spirit of "manage as soon as it's planted, manage to the end." The Wenjiang Special District expanded its wheat area by 200,000 mu this year, and 80% of the communes achieved garden-style management, standardized technology, professional management personnel, and frequent inspections and comparisons. Now the seedlings have grown to five or six inches high. As soon as wheat sowing ended in the Nanchong Special District, a field management competition centered on accumulating and applying fertilizer was launched. Topdressing, irrigation, pest control, rolling, and weeding were closely coordinated and progressed simultaneously. More than 2.8 million mu of wheat in the special district have been topdressed with more than 5,000 jin of fertilizer per mu.
　　In the field management of spring grain crops, all localities have established a comprehensive perspective, combining the establishment of specialized teams with mass movements, and combining long-term plans with short-term arrangements. They have assigned management tasks to teams, households, and individuals by area, section, and plant, focusing on both large and small crops, concentrated and scattered crops, wheat and miscellaneous grains, managing everything well to win a comprehensive bumper harvest.

Fujian
　　This newspaper reports that Fujian's mountainous area "three transformations" of mountain fields (i.e., changing serial irrigation to rotational irrigation, transforming muddy fields, and transforming cold water fields) is developing vigorously. More than 500,000 soldiers are fighting in the terraced fields and deep mountain fields despite the cold. As of January 11, 1960, the area of "three transformations" fields in the province had reached 4.89 million mu.
　　The serial irrigation fields, muddy fields, and cold water fields in the vast mountainous areas of Fujian have many springs, resulting in perennial serial irrigation and overflow, causing fertilizer and soil loss. In addition, the ground temperature and water temperature are very low, which is not conducive to crop growth. After liberation, farmers in mountainous areas had carried out preliminary transformations on 70% of the serial irrigation fields, muddy fields, and cold water fields. In the winter of 1959, party committees at all levels in mountainous areas listed the "three transformations" as the focus of water conservancy construction in mountainous areas. They aimed to not only transform all 30% of the serial irrigation fields, muddy fields, and cold water fields that had not been transformed, but also to further transform the fields that had been transformed in previous years to achieve high standards. In the Minbei area, drainage ditches were dug in the fields that had undergone "three transformations," field ridges were raised and thickened, bamboo pipes were buried to draw out spring water, and fertilizers such as lime were applied to improve the soil.
　　In order to do a good job in the "three transformations" of mountain fields, party organizations at all levels strengthened their leadership and launched a mass movement. The first secretary of the Chong'an County Party Committee went deep into the Chengguan Commune to pilot the "three transformations," create experience, and guide the "three transformations" movement throughout the county. The Yongtai County Party Committee sent Wang Mengzhao, a member of the county party committee and deputy county magistrate, and six cadres to the Guancun Management Area, which had more muddy fields, to work on more than 1,000 mu of "three transformations" fields, and then held a county-wide on-site meeting to promote it. On the basis of basically completing the "three transformations," Shouning County organized a 1,000-person inspection, and through inspection, summarization, and improvement, reprocessed and made up lessons for more than 18,000 mu of substandard fields.

Hebei
　　This newspaper reports that the people's communes in Hebei are seizing the opportunity before the Spring Festival to carry out competitions in accumulating and delivering fertilizer. As of early January, the province had accumulated 102.48 billion jin of coarse fertilizer and produced more than 6.6 billion jin of soil fertilizer. According to incomplete statistics, the province has delivered 479.8 billion jin of fertilizer.
　　Currently, more than 7.5 million laborers throughout the province are engaged in accumulating and delivering fertilizer, and many areas have continuously launched blitz campaigns. From the municipal and district party committees to the production teams, the party secretaries took the lead and formed a strong specialized front for accumulating and delivering fertilizer.
　　While building chemical fertilizer plants on a large scale, all parts of the province have focused on fertilizer accumulation activities centered on pig raising. More than 100,000 field pig farms have been established throughout the province, which has greatly saved labor and animal power for delivering fertilizer. The Handan Special District has built more than 25,000 pig farms and chemical fertilizer plants in the fields, averaging more than 10,000 jin of coarse fertilizer and more than 100 jin of soil fertilizer per mu. In this movement, party secretaries at all levels generally cultivated "experimental plots" to summarize and promote advanced experience in a timely manner.
　　How to transport the fertilizer out in time? From the time the river water froze, Zhangjiakou, Chengde and other regions mobilized the masses to manufacture ice beds and build ice roads, adopting the method of transporting fertilizer using ice roads. After improving and creating many transportation tools, Xinle County launched a competition of mutual assistance between rich teams and poor teams, teams with more carts and horses and teams with fewer carts and horses, and advanced teams helping backward teams in delivering fertilizer together.

    搞好冬季生产迎新春
    广东要冬季生产红到底　四川狠抓小春作物管理  福建改造山田四百万亩　河北掀起积肥送肥高潮
    广东
    本报讯　广东省冬季生产进行得很好。全省各级领导正在这一胜利的基础上组织农村工作大检查，促进冬季生产红到底。
    广东省的冬季生产动手早，进度快。早在去年10月间，全省即组织一百五十万劳动力，提早进行重点水利工程的施工；11月秋收大忙，又采取边收、边犁、边种的办法，到11月底秋收结束，冬种计划也同时宣告完成。从12月开始，即以大兴水利为中心，结合深翻改良土壤和积肥，全面开展农田基建工作。现在，全省水利工程已完成的土方，等于上年度同期完成土方的三倍。现在已经修好中小型水利工程十八万宗，受益万亩以上的重点工程一百二十宗。扩大深翻面积一千万亩的计划已完成九百二十多万亩，一般深耕六寸以上，重点改造的落后田占二百多万亩。积各种自然肥料六十六亿多担，全省五千多万亩耕地平均每亩一百二十多担。养猪业也逐月增长，全省一共有公社、大队、小队和食堂四级饲养场十七万个。冬季副业生产的现金收入，已达四亿二千五百多万元，平均每个农业人口有十多元。
    全省将全面推广提早播种、插秧的经验，决定今年要在立春开始播种，清明前结束插秧，争取早稻稳定高产。由于以水、土、肥为中心的备耕工作抓得早、进度快，对春播春插已掌握了更大的主动权。现在，各地农民已开始浸种、整理秧地等活动，迎接春节过后的春播开门红。
    四川
    本报讯　四川各地狠抓小春粮食作物田间管理，力争实现“小春半年粮”。
    四川的小春粮食作物田间管理运动是以小麦为中心开展的。许多地方都在播种结束前就组织了专业队，规划了开展突击运动的时间，准备好了工具、物资等，贯彻执行了“种下就管，一管到底”的精神。温江专区今年小麦面积扩大了二十万亩，80％的公社做到了管理园田化、技术规格化、管理人员专业化、检查评比经常化，现在苗架已长到五、六寸高。南充专区小麦播种刚一结束，就开展了以积肥施肥为中心的田间管理评比竞赛，追、灌、治、压、薅各个环节紧密配合、齐头并进，全专区二百八十多万亩小麦每亩追肥已达五千斤以上。
    在小春粮食作物田间管理工作中，各地都树立了全面观点，作到了建立专业队与群众运动相结合、长计划和短安排相结合。他们将管理任务分片、分段、分株落实到队、到户、到人，既抓大宗、也抓小宗，既抓集中成片作物、也抓零星分散作物，既抓小麦、也抓杂粮，样样管好，夺取全面大丰收。
    福建
    本报讯　福建山区山田“三改”（即串灌改轮灌、改造烂泥田、改造冷水田）运动正在蓬勃开展。五十多万大军冒寒奋战在层层叠叠的梯田和深山密林的山垅田中。到1960年1月11日止，全省“三改”的田地已达四百八十九万亩。
    福建广大山区的串灌田、烂泥田、冷水田，由于泉眼很多，常年串灌漫流，肥料、土壤冲失，加上地温、水温很低，不利于作物生长。解放后，山区农民已对70％的串灌田、烂泥田、冷水田进行了初步改造。1959年冬，山区各级党委都把“三改”列为山区水利建设的重点，既要把30％没有改造的串灌田、烂泥田、冷水田全部进行改造，还要对前几年已经改造过的田地作进一步的改造，使之达到高标准化。闽北地区经过“三改”的田地都开挖了排水沟，加高培厚田埂，埋设竹管，引出泉水，并施用了石灰等肥料改造土壤。
    为了搞好山田“三改”，各地党组织加强了领导，大搞群众运动。崇安县委第一书记深入到城关公社搞“三改”试点，创造经验，指导全县“三改”运动。永泰县委派出了县委委员、副县长王孟昭和六个干部到烂泥田较多的官村管理区搞了一千多亩的“三改”田，然后召开全县现场会进行推广。寿宁县在基本完成“三改”的基础上，组织了千人大检查，通过边检查、边总结、边改进，对一万八千多亩不合标准的田地重新加工补课。
    河北
    本报讯　河北各人民公社抓紧春节前的时机，开展积肥、送肥竞赛。截至1月上旬，全省积粗肥一万零二百四十八亿斤，造土化肥六十六亿多斤。据不完全统计，全省已送肥四千七百九十八亿斤。
    目前，全省投入积肥送肥的劳力达七百五十多万人，许多地区连续开展了突击运动。市、地委到生产队，都由党委书记挂帅，组成了一条强有力的积肥送肥专业战线。
    全省各地在大建化肥厂的同时，抓紧了以养猪为中心的积肥活动。全省已建立起田间猪场十万多个，这就大大节省了送肥的劳畜力。邯郸专区在田间建起的猪场、化肥厂等就有两万五千个，平均每亩地有一万多斤粗肥和一百多斤土化肥。在这一运动中，各级党委书记一般都搞“试验田”，及时总结和推广先进经验。
    如何及时把肥运出？张家口、承德两地区以及其他一些地区，从河水结冻时起，就发动群众制造冰床，修造冰道，采用冰道运肥的方法。新乐县在改良创制了许多运输工具后，掀起了富队帮穷队，车马多的队帮车马少的队，先进队帮落后队的送肥携手竞赛。（附图片）
