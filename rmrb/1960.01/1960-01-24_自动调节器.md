    Automatic Regulator
    Workers at the Shanghai Dahua Instrument Factory have produced a set of the latest modern electronic automatic regulators for power stations. With this set of electronic regulators, the water supply to the boiler, the amount of fuel consumption, and the amount of air supplied to the furnace can be automatically controlled without manual operation. This ensures that the boiler burns normally and economically, maintains a stable water level, and provides uniform steam, ensuring normal power generation. This not only liberates people from heavy labor but also increases labor productivity.
    This set of electronic regulators consists of more than twenty kinds of instruments, including flow transmitters, three-impulse electronic regulators, power supply resonant voltage stabilizers, differentiators, calibrators, and remote controllers. This electronic automatic regulator can be used to form various automatic control systems and has no moving parts that require special maintenance during operation. It is an important piece of equipment for the automatic control of modern thermal power plants and is the nervous system of modern thermal power plants. (Attached picture)

    自动调节器
    上海大华仪表厂职工，制成了一套现代最新的电站用的电子自动调节器。有了这套电子调节器，不用人工操作，就可以自动控制锅炉的给水量、燃料消耗量和向炉膛内送风量等，使锅炉的燃烧正常、经济，保持水位平稳，蒸汽均匀，保证正常发电。不但把人们从繁重的劳动中解放出来，还提高劳动生产率。
    这套电子式调节器，是由二十多种各式仪器组成的，包括流量变送器、三冲量电子调节仪、电源谐振稳压器、微分仪、校正仪和远方控制器等。这种电子自动调节器可以用来组成各种不同的自动化控制系统，并设有在运行中需要特别维护的运动机件。它是现代化火电站自动控制的重要装备，是现代火电站的神经系统。（附图片）
