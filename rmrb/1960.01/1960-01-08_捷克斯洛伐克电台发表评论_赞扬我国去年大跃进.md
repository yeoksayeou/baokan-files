Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 6th. Czechoslovakian Radio broadcast a commentary last night praising the great achievements of the Chinese people last year. The commentary pointed out that the main targets of China's Second Five-Year Plan were completed in just two years last year, which is a huge victory.

The commentary emphasized that 1959 was the continuation of the Great Leap Forward that began at the start of China's Second Five-Year Plan. The commentary pointed out that by the end of last year, China had greatly exceeded the 1962 production targets for steel and coal stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan. Although natural disasters occurred (which would mean starvation under other regimes), the grain harvest still exceeded the original 1962 target. The commentary pointed out that last year, China's people's communes were further consolidated. The commentary said that it was precisely because of the people's communes that the people in the disaster areas were able to overcome drought and floods.

The commentary traced the astonishing backwardness and poverty of People's China ten years ago, and emphasized that now, the People's Republic of China ranks seventh in the world in steel production and third in coal production. The commentary pointed out that the massive mobilization of the people is the main feature of China's solution to its construction tasks.

    赞扬我国去年大跃进
    新华社布拉格6日电　捷克斯洛伐克电台昨晚发表评论，赞扬中国人民去年取得的伟大成就。评论指出，中国第二个五年计划的主要指标仅仅用两年的时间就在去年完成了，这是一个巨大的胜利。
    评论强调说，1959年是中国从第二个五年计划初期开始的大跃进的继续，评论指出，到去年年底，中国已经大大超额完成了第二个五年计划规定的1962年的钢和煤的生产指标。虽然发生了自然灾害（在别的政权下这将意味着饥饿），但是，粮食的收获量仍然超过了原订1962年的指标。评论指出，去年，中国的人民公社进一步巩固了。评论说，正是由于有了人民公社，受灾地区的人民才能够战胜干旱和洪水。
    评论追溯了人民中国十年前的惊人落后和贫困状态，并且强调说，现在，中华人民共和国在钢铁生产方面已经占世界第七位，在煤的生产方面占第三位。评论指出，人民群众的巨大动员是中国解决它的建设任务的主要特点。
