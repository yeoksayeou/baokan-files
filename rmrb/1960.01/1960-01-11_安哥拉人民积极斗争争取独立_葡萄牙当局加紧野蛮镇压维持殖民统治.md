Xinhua News Agency, 9th - According to recent reports in some foreign newspapers, inspired by the booming national independence movement in Africa, the Angolan people, regardless of the Portuguese colonialists' brutal suppression, are intensifying their struggle for independence.

The "African Weekly," published in New York, USA, on December 4, wrote in an article titled "Disturbances in Portuguese Africa" that increasing signs indicate that Portuguese Africa has been politically awakened. This situation is particularly evident in Angola. Despite the Portuguese authorities' drastic police measures, the Angolan People's Union—a broad political movement in Angola—has greatly strengthened its actions. It recently succeeded in distributing pamphlets, slogans, and leaflets demanding immediate independence throughout Angola, which greatly frustrated the Portuguese authorities.

The article cited a recent report by the Angolan People's Union on the Angolan people's struggle against Portuguese colonial rule. The report stated that the Angolan People's Union's struggle goals are very clear. It firmly demands, "Immediate and complete independence for Angola, respect for the Angolan people's dignity instead of disregard, strengthening Afro-Asian solidarity, and self-respect instead of racial segregation and inhuman treatment."

The report added, "In Angola, individual freedom, freedom of speech, belief, and assembly are practically non-existent. Therefore, national liberation movements like the Angolan People's Union can only exist as underground movements within the country."

The report mentioned that the Angolan People's Union has been engaged in continuous struggle since its establishment in 1954. In December 1955, organized struggles took place in northern Angola against the colonialists' forced labor system and the constant humiliation of the Angolan people. The report pointed out that the Angolan national movement has spread to the north, south, east, and west, penetrating every level of the Bantu people, and even reaching the mixed-race population.

The Portuguese colonialists have implemented brutal suppression against the Angolan people who demand independence. The aforementioned report cited in the article pointed out that in February 1956, the colonial authorities carried out a series of arrests and exiles. Ambrosio Luyanzi was one of the national movement leaders who was persecuted to death, and patriots such as Figueira, Lelo, and Libório Neves were exiled to the Silva Porto concentration camp.

The article further pointed out that the Portuguese colonial authorities have erected an "iron curtain isolating Angola from the rest of the world." "All Angolans returning from other territories are either immediately sent to the already overcrowded Tigres Bay prison or to São Tomé Island, from which no African can return alive. Angola's borders are guarded by the army."

The article also revealed that Portuguese colonialists are attempting to have more Portuguese people immigrate to Angola to maintain Portuguese colonial rule.

However, the article pointed out that while carrying out brutal suppression, the Portuguese are increasingly aware that their policies are facing increasing difficulties in Africa and internationally.

Earlier, the "New Africa" weekly, published in Senegal, West Africa, in an article titled "Angola at the Moment of Trouble," described the tragic lives of the Angolan people.

The article stated that Angolans cannot enjoy basic civil rights, and the vast majority of indigenous people live in extreme poverty. Their only hope is to become servants of the colonialists.

The article pointed out that in Angola, any action that goes against official policy is met with ruthless suppression. Any idea about the liberation of Africa is considered "treasonous crime." Since some (anti-colonial rule) incidents occurred in neighboring countries, a large number of troops have been sent to Angola.

### 安哥拉人民积极斗争争取独立  葡萄牙当局加紧野蛮镇压维持殖民统治

    安哥拉人民积极斗争争取独立
    葡萄牙当局加紧野蛮镇压维持殖民统治
    新华社9日讯　据最近一些外国报刊报道，在非洲蓬勃发展着的民族独立运动的鼓舞下，安哥拉人民不顾葡萄牙殖民者的残酷镇压，正在加紧为取得独立而斗争。
    在美国纽约出版的“非洲周刊”12月4日在一篇题为“葡属非洲的纷扰”的文章中写道，越来越多的迹象表明葡属非洲已经在政治上觉醒。这种情况在安哥拉特别明显。尽管葡萄牙当局采取激烈的警察措施，安哥拉人民联盟——安哥拉的一个广泛的政治运动——已经大大地加强了它的行动。它最近成功地在安哥拉全国散发了要求立即独立的小册子、标语和传单，这使葡萄牙当局非常懊丧。
    文章援引了安哥拉人民联盟不久前发表的关于安哥拉人民反对葡萄牙殖民统治的斗争的报告。报告说，安哥拉人民联盟的斗争目标是很明确的。它坚决要求，“安哥拉立即完全独立，要求给予安哥拉人民尊严而不是漠视，要求加强亚非的团结，要求自尊而不要种族隔离和非人的待遇。”
    报告又说，“在安哥拉，个人自由、言论、信仰和集会的自由实际上是不存在的。因此，像安哥拉人民联盟这样的民族解放运动就只能作为国内的一个地下运动而存在。”
    报告谈到，安哥拉人民联盟自从1954年成立以来就在进行不断的斗争。1955年12月，在安哥拉北部曾进行有组织的斗争反对殖民者的强迫劳动制度和对安哥拉人民的经常的凌辱。报告指出，安哥拉民族运动已传布到北部、南部、东部和西部，深入班图人民的每一阶层，甚至深入黑白混血儿之中。
    葡萄牙殖民主义者对要求独立的安哥拉人民实行了野蛮的镇压。文章所引述的上述报告指出，1956年2月，殖民当局进行了一系列的逮捕和放逐，安布罗西奥·卢扬齐就是被迫害致死的民族运动领袖之一，像菲盖拉、莱洛和利博里奥·讷夫万这样的爱国人士都被放遂到西尔瓦·波多集中营。
    文章又指出，葡萄牙殖民当局树立起“把安哥拉同外界其他地区隔绝开来的铁幕”。“所有从其他领地回国的安哥拉人不是被立即送到已经十分拥挤的提格雷斯湾监狱，就是被送到没有一个非洲人能活着回来的圣托姆岛去。安哥拉的边境都在军队的守卫之下。”
    文章还揭露葡萄牙殖民主义者企图使更多的葡萄牙人移居安哥拉，来保持葡萄牙的殖民统治。
    然而，文章指出，葡萄牙人在进行残酷镇压的同时，越来越认识到，他们的政策已经在非洲和国际上遭到愈来愈多的困难。
    早些时候，在西非塞内加尔出版的“新非洲”周刊在一篇题为“出事时刻的安哥拉”的文章中叙述了安哥拉人民的悲惨生活。
    文章说，安哥拉人不能享受公民基本权利，绝大多数土著人生活在极端贫困之中，他们唯一的希望就是成为殖民者的佣人。
    文章指出，在安哥拉，一切同官方政策相违背的行动都遭到无情的镇压。任何关于解放非洲的想法都被认为是“叛国罪行”。自从邻国发生一些（反殖民统治的）事件以来，大批军队被派到安哥拉去。
