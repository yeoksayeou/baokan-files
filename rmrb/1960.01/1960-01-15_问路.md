Asking the Way (Crosstalk Play)
    Liang Jingyao

    Rural Old Man, referred to as Old.
    PLA Soldier, referred to as Soldier.

Old: (Enters) I, this old man, am seventy-eight,
    A bit deaf, but my eyes are still bright.
    The countryside has realized communization,
    Happy, I can’t stop smiling all day long.
    Enjoying a good life in the home for the elderly,
    My heart really can't bear it,
    Sneaking out of the village to pick up some manure,
    More manure makes for better crops.

Soldier: (Enters) Haven't been home in a year of service,
    Hometown changes are really great,
    Can't recognize the way home,
    Walking back and forth, no way to find it.
    Hey!
    There's an old man ahead,
    I'll go ask the old gentleman.
    Hello, old man!

Old: Not much? (Shakes head) Not much, not much,
    I'll pick up some more on the way back.

Soldier: Old man, I want to ask for directions.

Old: Can’t stay idle? Yes! Everyone is in the Great Leap Forward!
    After studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee a few days ago, everyone is opposing Right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale. I'm old but my heart isn't, and I also want to boost morale!

Soldier: I'm asking for directions, please...

Old: A model! What kind of model am I?
    I've worked all my life, can’t stay idle.

Soldier: Hey! That's what you call boosting morale!

Old: My body is strong? Not anymore. Back
    then, carrying a hundred and eighty pounds for twenty or thirty
    miles was no problem, but not anymore! My legs
    can't keep up!

Soldier: Hey! You are really a good worker!

Old: The crops in front? (Points ahead while saying)
    Growing well. Look at that white cotton,
    taller than me, the cotton bolls bigger than
    my fist. Further ahead is the vegetable garden.
    Good heavens! Those cabbages and sweet potatoes are growing
    so strangely, I’ve never seen anything like it in my life.

Soldier: Yes, this year's agricultural production has taken another big
    step forward.

Old: Ah! Reservoir? There's a reservoir, if there wasn't a
    reservoir, the crops wouldn't grow so well.
    We're having the biggest drought in fifty years,
    but we still have a good harvest! Hey...

Soldier: Yes! Many places across the country are having a great harvest like we are here.

Old: Right, the reservoir was built by everyone. If we didn't have
    the People's Commune, with more people and more strength, we
    wouldn't be able to build this big reservoir even in another ten
    years if we relied on our agricultural cooperative alone.

Soldier: You're right, you're saying the right things…

Old: The commune is good! Yes! The People's Commune is just
    good, how could we build a big reservoir without the People's
    Commune! Without a reservoir, how could we have a great harvest
    in this year of great drought?

Soldier: With the commune, everyone is happy.
    Old man, it's getting late, can you tell me
    how far it is to the Nan'jian River?

Old: Ah! Are you asking if the commune has a barbershop?
    Yes! There's also a bathhouse, go take a bath. (Tries to pull the soldier away)

Soldier: I'm not going, I don't have time now.

Old: No cash? You don't need any money at all...

Soldier: You're mistaken! I'm asking how
    far it is to the Nan'jian River?

Old: Want to see the kindergarten? Okay! It's in the
    grove of trees on the left side of the village. Hey! Those
    children are extremely happy, go take a look.

Soldier: Okay! I'll definitely go look when I have time.
    Now I'm asking you how far it is to the Nan'jian River?

Old: Want to see the home for the elderly? Great! We old
    folks welcome you! Go see how
    happy we live!

Soldier: Okay, I'll definitely make another trip later.

Old: You want to see the cafeteria too?

Soldier: I didn't say that.

Old: The food is good. There's dry food and there's
    soup, the food is fragrant,
    hot, and delicious. Now women no
    longer need to work at the stove, and can all participate in labor.

Soldier: Not bad! Not bad!...

Old: Who dares to sabotage it! The commune is our lifeline,
    whoever dares to sabotage it, I'll fight them to the death!
    Our People's Liberation Army must train hard
    to defend our socialism!

Soldier: We will definitely train hard and defend our country.
    Old man, which road do I take to the Nan'jian River?

Old: What? Which road to take? Needless to say,
    we must only listen to the Party and take the socialist
    road.

Soldier: No, old man, why do you pull east when I say west?

Old: Oh! You're going to the Nan'jian River? Go straight
    down this road, and you'll be there in ten li.

Soldier: Thank you.

Old: Aren't you going to come to our home for the elderly
    for a sit?

Soldier: No, goodbye,
    old man.

    梁景尧
    农村老汉，简称老。
    解放军战士，简称士。老：（上场）我老汉今年七十八，
    耳朵有点聋，眼睛可不花。农
    村实现公社化，乐得我整天合
    不上牙。敬老院里享清福，心
    里实在忍不下，偷偷出村拾点
    粪，多上粪才有好庄稼。士：（上场）服役一年没回家，家
    乡变化实在大，两眼认不出回
    家路，走走返返没办法。哎！
    前面有位老大爷，待我上前问
    问老人家。老大爷，你好！老：不少？（摇摇头）不多不多，
    往回走还要拾点。士：老大爷，我想问问路。老：闲不住？是啊！现在都在大跃
    进吗！前几天学完八届八中全
    会的文件以后，都在反右倾、
    鼓干劲，我人老心不老，也要
    鼓干劲呀！士：我是问路，麻烦麻烦你……老：模范啊！我算得上什么模范，
    干了一辈子活，闲不住呀。士：嘿！这才叫鼓足干劲！老：我的身子骨硬？不行了。想当
    年百八十斤扛起来走三、二十
    里路没问题，现在不行啦！腿
    脚跟不上劲喽！士：嘿！你真是一个好劳动家！老：前面那庄稼？（边说边指前面）
    长得不错呀。你看那片白花花
    的棉花比我都高，棉桃长得比
    拳头都大，再往前是菜园子。
    好家伙！那白菜、红薯长得那
    样出奇，我活了一辈子也没有
    见过。士：是呀，今年的农业生产又大大
    地向前跨了一步。老：啊！水库？有水库，要是没有
    水库，庄稼不会长得这么好。
    咱这是五十年来没有过的大旱
    灾，照样丰收啦！嘿……士：是呀！全国很多地方和咱们这
    里一样大丰收了。老：对，水库是大家修的，要是没
    有人民公社，人多力量大，单
    靠我们一个农业社呀，再等十
    年也修不起这个大水库。士：你说的对，你说的好……老：公社好！是啊！人民公社就是
    好，要没有人民公社怎么能修
    起大水库！要没有水库，今年
    大旱，怎么会有大丰收呢？士：有了公社后，咱人人都高兴。
    老大爷，天不早了，你告诉我
    去南涧河还有多远？老：啊！你问公社有没有理发店，
    有！还有个洗澡塘，你去洗洗
    吧。（边说边拉战士走）士：不去了，现在没时间。老：没现钱？根本不要钱……士：你搞错了！我是问南涧河还有
    多远？老：要看看幼儿园？行啊！就在村
    左边那片树林子里。嘿！那些
    孩子们幸福极了，你去看看。士：好！回头有了工夫，一定去看。
    现在我问你南涧河还有多远？老：想看敬老院？好哇！我们这些
    老头子欢迎你！你去看看我们
    生活得有多么幸福！士：好啦，以后我一定再来跑一趟。老：你还想看看食堂？士：我没说这个话。老：吃的不错。要干的有干的；要
    稀的有稀的，做的饭菜又香、
    又热、又可口，这下妇女再不
    必转锅台了，全去参加劳动了。士：不坏！不坏！……老：谁敢破坏！公社是咱们的命根
    子，谁敢破坏，我跟他拼命！
    咱们人民解放军一定要好好练
    武，保卫咱社会主义呀？士：我们一定好好练武，保卫祖国。
    老大爷，到南涧河走哪条路呀？老：怎么？走哪条路？那还用说，
    咱们只有听党的话，走社会主
    义的大路呗。士：不，老大爷，怎么我往东说你
    往西扯。老：噢！你是去南涧河？从这条路
    一直走，十里就到了。士：谢谢你。老：你不到咱敬老院
    坐坐吗？士：不了，再见，
    老大爷。
