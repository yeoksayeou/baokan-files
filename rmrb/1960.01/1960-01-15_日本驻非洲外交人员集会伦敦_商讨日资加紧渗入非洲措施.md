Xinhua News Agency, London, 13th: Japanese diplomats stationed in Africa concluded a three-day meeting in London on the 12th. The meeting discussed the expansion of Japanese exports to Africa and capital penetration.

According to reports, the meeting, chaired by Japanese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Kinuji Kobayashi, drafted a report suggesting the promotion of Japanese economic expansion in Africa. This report will be submitted to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Reports say that most of the meeting was spent studying the recent political and economic trends in African countries and discussing ways for Japanese trade to enter African countries.

Japanese diplomats stationed in Africa reported in detail on the economic situation of African countries at the meeting. They believe that Japan has ample opportunities to increase the dumping of its industrial products on the African continent.

Nobuhiko Ushiba, Director of the Economic Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also asked these diplomats stationed in Africa to provide more reports at the meeting.

The meeting was attended by Japanese diplomats stationed in the following African countries: the Union of South Africa, the Belgian Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Ghana. Japanese diplomatic representatives in the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium also attended the meeting. This meeting of Japanese diplomats stationed in Africa centrally reflects the ambition of Japanese monopoly capital to extend its economic power into Africa. In the past year, Japan has sent entrepreneurs and officials to various parts of Africa for "exploratory" trips.

According to news from Tokyo, experts from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed that after this meeting of Japanese diplomats stationed in Africa, Japan will immediately send an "expert delegation" to Ghana and Nigeria. Japan is negotiating a commercial treaty with Ghana.

The news also said that Japan's Shimu Chemical Industry Co. is negotiating an investment of 10 billion yen in a nickel plant in Rhodesia. Since May of last year, Taiyo Fisheries Co. has invested nearly 100,000 US dollars in a coastal fishing company in Casablanca, Morocco. Japan also expects to send exploration personnel to Tanganyika, Somaliland, and Madagascar to explore mineral resources there.
