This newspaper reports: In the pig raising movement, members of science and technology associations in various parts of Shaanxi Province are doing everything possible to find pig feed, improve feeding methods, and use scientific and technological knowledge to promote the vigorous development of pig raising.

Science and technology associations at all levels in Shaanxi actively mobilize members and scientific and technological workers to conduct research on pig feed and to open up feed sources for pig raising. The Science and Technology Association of the Hongshan Management Area of the Shizhuan Commune in Ankang County organized a breeding research team composed of eighteen farmers with pig-raising experience. They carried out a "tasting hundreds of herbs" movement, going deep into the mountains to collect many kinds of wild herbs for boiling, bleaching, and other experiments. In a very short period of time, they produced 257 kinds of feed suitable for feeding pigs. The Science and Technology Association members of the Liucheng Commune in Shiquan County used corn cobs, bean chaff, and wild plants such as wormwood to create 42 kinds of concentrated feed and more than 100 kinds of roughage through boiling, bleaching, and fermentation. The Feng County Science and Technology Association mobilized its members and the masses to collect more than 370 kinds of wild feed in a recent period. The successful trial production of these substitute feeds effectively solved the difficulty of insufficient feed and played a very important role in the pig raising industry.

While studying and solving pig feed problems, science and technology associations in various places also deeply summarized experience in pig feeding and management. The feeding teams of the Yujiagou Production Team of the Xinpu Commune in Mian County have explored and summarized a set of scientific feeding methods. These methods are: feeding frequently with small amounts, feeding in stages, three diligences (diligently cleaning the pen, diligently bedding the pen, diligently feeding), five knowledges (knowing when they are cold, hot, full, hungry, thirsty), and six cleanlinesses (clean trough, clean pen, clean feed, clean water, clean body, clean grass). Because of the adoption of the above feeding methods, the occurrence of swine fever has been greatly controlled. The Ankang Shizhuan Commune Science and Technology Association assisted production teams in promoting methods such as early prevention of diseases, early treatment of diseases, and group management of livestock according to male, female, strong, and weak characteristics, basically eliminating the phenomenon of hog cholera.

In order to transmit advanced pig-raising experiences and new pig-raising technologies to the masses in a timely and vigorous manner, science and technology associations in various places have adopted various methods to carry out publicity activities such as on-site meetings, training courses, teaching groups, exhibitions, lectures, radio broadcasts, and publishing materials. The Baoji City and Shiquan County Science and Technology Associations, in order to ensure that pig-raising publicity is known to every household, recently formed a pig-raising experience and technology teaching group together with the Agricultural Bureau, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the Veterinary Station to carry out publicity activities in the commune production teams. The technical teaching group started from the perspective of facilitating the solution of practical problems and adopted the method of promoting local experience on the spot, which has achieved good results. The Xi'an City Science and Technology Association's pig-raising technology training class held in Yanta District in conjunction with the local Agricultural Bureau and other units has now trained more than 200 pig-raising technical personnel, which has improved the pig-raising technical level of the masses from a scientific theoretical point of view. Science and technology associations in Tongchuan, Shangxian, Hancheng, Shiquan and other places have compiled and printed more than 60 kinds of pig-raising technical materials.

This newspaper also reports that the Animal Husbandry Department of Jilin Agricultural University is production-oriented and combines teaching with animal husbandry scientific research work centered on pig raising. At present, it has completed the analysis of nutritional components of 390 kinds of livestock feed, found a large number of substitute feeds and wild plants suitable for feed, and provided a scientific basis for rational utilization of feed and exploration of feed resources.

In the second half of 1958, the Animal Husbandry Department of Jilin Agricultural University, according to the needs of production and the division of national scientific research tasks, organized some teachers and students to engage in scientific analysis of feed nutritional components. In order to save fine feed, teachers and students focused their analysis on wild plants such as wild grass and wild vegetables. These wild plants are all common in various regions of Jilin Province and are suitable for large-scale collection, planting, and utilization in the future. In the process of collecting samples, teachers and students went to 14 cities and counties, including Da'an, Baicheng, Zhenlai, Changling, and Nong'an, to conduct investigation and research activities in conjunction with experienced farmers. In these places, they collected more than 300 kinds of feed samples, discovered many wild feeds that they did not know about in the past, and also learned a lot of practical knowledge about wild plant feeds that were not available in books. After returning to school, they processed, sorted, and classified them, and conducted detailed scientific analysis. For each type of feed, they measured nine nutritional components including water content, protein, fat, fiber, nitrogen-free extract, phosphorus, calcium, and carotene, which fully met the scientific research indicators uniformly stipulated by the country. Analysis has proved that wild plants such as wild grass and wild vegetables not only contain various vitamins and easily digestible and absorbable minerals necessary for livestock, but also the protein content in some wild plant feeds is richer than that of grain crops. In addition, the protein in wild plants contains a large amount of amino acids that cannot be formed in the animal body. It can synthesize animal protein and make livestock grow vigorously. It is more suitable for livestock than protein in grains and bran.

The department also analyzed the nutritional components of some agricultural by-products and by-products of the food processing industry. Through analysis, it has been proved that by-products of sugar making, brewing, oil extraction, and flour milling are also good feeds for pigs.

The results of the scientific analysis of the nutritional components of hundreds of kinds of livestock feeds show that as long as wild plants, agricultural by-products, and food processing industry by-products and other feeds can be rationally allocated according to the physiological needs of pigs, it is possible to develop pig raising and other animal husbandry businesses on a large scale without using or using less grain. More than 200 analytical achievements of this department have been adopted by the Institute of Animal Husbandry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and compiled in the book "Content Table of Nutritional Components of Domestic Feed."

Now, the teachers and students of the Animal Husbandry Department of Jilin Agricultural University are continuing to conduct research around the development of pig raising and strive to achieve research results in pig breeding, fattening, multiple births, and mass pig raising management this year.

    科学研究为养猪事业服务
    陕西各地科协组织搜集野生饲料并为公社培训技术人材
    吉林农大畜牧系完成三百多种饲料营养成分的分析工作
    本报讯　陕西省各地科学技术协会会员在养猪运动中，千方百计寻找各地猪饲料，改善饲养方法，用科学技术知识推动养猪事业的蓬勃发展。
    陕西各地科协积极发动会员和广大科学技术工作者，对养猪饲料进行研究工作，为养猪广开饲料来源。安康县石转公社洪山管理区科协，组织了一个由十八名有养猪经验的农民组成的饲养研究专业小组。他们开展了“尝百草”运动，深入高山峻岭，将许多种野草采集回来，进行了煮、漂等试验工作。在很短的时间内，他们就制出了二百五十七种适合于喂猪的饲料。石泉县柳城公社的科协会员们，利用玉米心、豆糠和野生植物如无娘草等，经过煮、漂、发酵的处理，制出了四十二种精料和一百余种粗料。凤县科协在最近的一个时期内，发动会员和群众搜集野生饲料达三百七十余种。这些代饲料的试制成功，有力地解决了饲料不足的困难，对养猪事业起了极重要的作用。
    各地科协在研究解决猪饲料的同时，还深入总结了猪的饲养管理方面的经验。沔县新铺公社余家沟生产队等饲养专业小组，摸索总结出一套科学的饲养方法，这些方法是：少喂勤喂，分段饲养以及三勤（勤起圈、勤垫圈、勤喂），五知（知冷、知热、知饱、知饿、知渴），六净（槽净、圈净、料净、水净、体净、草净）。由于采用了上述饲养方法，大大控制了猪疫的发生。安康石转公社科协协助各生产队推广了无病早防、有病早治、按家畜的公、母、强、弱分群管理等办法，基本上消灭了猪瘟现象。
    各地科协为了及时地、大力地把养猪的先进经验和养猪新技术传授给群众，采取了现场会、训练班、传授团、展览会、讲演、广播，以及出版资料等各种各样的方式开展宣传活动。宝鸡市、石泉县科协，为做到养猪宣传家喻户晓，最近协同农业局、共青团、妇联、兽医站等单位，组成了养猪经验技术传授团，深入公社生产队开展宣传活动。技术传授团从便于解决实际问题出发，采取了当地经验就地推广的办法，收到良好效果。西安市科协在雁塔区与当地农业局等单位举办的养猪技术说训班，目前已培训出养猪技术人材二百余人，从科学理论上提高了群众的养猪技术水平。铜川、商县、韩城、石泉等地科协，编印的养猪技术材料达六十余种。
    本报讯　吉林农业大学畜牧系面向生产，结合教学，开展以养猪为中心的畜牧科学研究工作。目前，已完成三百九十种家畜饲料营养成分的分析工作，找出了大量的代用饲料及适合于做饲料的野生植物，为合理利用饲料和发掘饲料资源，提供了科学依据。
    1958年下半年，吉林农业大学畜牧系根据生产的需要和国家科学研究任务的分工，就组织部分师生搞饲料营养成分的科学分析工作。为了节约精饲料，师生把分析的重点放在野草、野菜等野生植物上，这些野生植物全是吉林省各地区常见的、适合将来大量采集和种植、利用的饲料。在采集样品的过程中，师生曾经到大安、白城、镇赉、长岭、农安等十四个市、县，与老农结合开展调查研究活动。在这些地方，他们共收集了三百多种饲料样品，发现了许多过去不知道的野生饲料，还学到了许多书本上没有的野生植物饲料的实际知识。回校以后，他们又经过加工整理，分科、分类，进行了细致的科学分析。对每种饲料都测定出所含水分、蛋白质、脂肪、纤维、无氮浸出物、磷、钙、胡萝卜素等九种营养成分，完全达到了全国统一规定的科学研究指标。通过分析证明：野草、野菜等野生植物饲料，不仅含有家畜所必需的各种维生素和易于消化吸收的各种矿物质，而且有些野生植物饲料中蛋白质的含量，比粮食作物还要丰富。另外，野生植物中的蛋白质，含有多量的家畜体内不能形成的氨基酸，它能合成动物性蛋白质，使家畜生长旺盛，比谷物和糠类中的蛋白质，更适合家畜所需要。
    这个系对一些农业副产品和食品加工工业的副产品的营养成分，也进行了分析。通过分析，证明制糖、酿造、榨油、制粉等的副产品，也都是猪的好饲料。
    对数百种家畜饲料营养成分的科学分析的结果，表明只要能按照猪的生理需要，合理地调配野生植物、农业的副产品和食品加工工业的副产品等饲料，就有可能在不用或少用粮食的情况下，大量发展养猪和其他畜牧事业。这个系的二百多种分析成果，已经为中国科学院畜牧研究所采用，汇集在“国产饲料营养成分含量表”一书中。
    现在，吉林农业大学畜牧系的师生，正在围绕发展养猪事业继续进行研究工作，争取今年在猪的育种、肥育、多胎多仔、大众养猪饲养管理等方面，取得研究成果。
