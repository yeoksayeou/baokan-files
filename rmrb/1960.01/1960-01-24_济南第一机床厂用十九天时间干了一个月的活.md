    济南第一机床厂用十九天时间干了一个月的活
    据新华社济南23日电　济南第一机床厂到19日已提前全面均衡地完成了1月份生产计划。平均日产水平与去年第四季度比较，产量提高11．76％，生产总值提高27．27％；单位成本降低2．29％。产品质量完全合格。
    济南第一机床厂党委采用“四算一比”方法，发动职工群众讨论了今年第一季度的跃进规划。四算是算思想觉悟干劲，算物质条件，算组织经验，算设备潜力；一比是看现在展望将来，回忆对比生产发展情况。因而，职工们今年一开始就认清当前大好形势，大闹技术革新和技术革命，1日到19日共实现革新九百六十五项，创造机器设备十一台，提高效率一倍到一千倍不等，保证计划提前完成。农忙小搞
