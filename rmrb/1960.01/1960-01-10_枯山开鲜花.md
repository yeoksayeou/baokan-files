Climbing up the Pailu Mountain, which rises about two thousand meters above sea level east of Haiyuan County, Ningxia, and looking around, terraces and strip fields on the mountainside are layered upon layer, like combs and comparisons; pasture and trees compete for beauty on the top of the mountain and on the slopes, and the gullies form neat and beautiful terraced fields and orchards.

This is the scene after the Hui and Han members of the Chengguan People's Commune in Haiyuan transformed a barren mountain with an area of 40 square kilometers, which had been eroded by wind and rain into a thousand holes and devoid of vegetation, into what it is today in just a few years with their heroic spirit that shakes the mountains and rivers. Legend has it that this barren mountain was originally one of the "Eight Scenic Spots" of Haiyuan County, but later, due to severe soil erosion, even the "Mountain God" could not stand it, so it harmed later generations. "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, heroes appear, and when the ambition is great, the mountains bow their heads." Now, this thousand-year-old barren mountain has bloomed with flowers after being managed by the people of the Mao Zedong era.

The Heroine Who Skillfully Embroidered the Barren Mountain

Speaking of the management of Pailu Mountain, women have always held high the bright red flag and marched forward with their heads held high. They are the vanguard of mountain management and skilled hands at skillfully embroidering barren mountains. In the spring of 1958, when the Great Leap Forward began, a large-scale mountain and water management campaign began here. At that time, spring farming production was very urgent, and the labor force for mountain management could not be mobilized. The Party organization put forward a slogan: Young people find water sources, old people go to farm, and women go to barren mountains. Inspired by this slogan, women flocked in and became the main force in managing barren mountains. They had no experience in mountain and water management and did not understand soil and water conservation technology, but they were not afraid of anything. With the determination to manage the mountains, they flew to the hills like eagles. Fa Lanying, a 23-year-old Hui woman, led 20 young men and women to take the lead. Some old people did not believe that the barren mountain could be managed well and said that these young people were making a fuss. They ignored these words and answered with the bold statement that "I will not give up if I do not manage the mountain well." They went up the mountain before dawn every day and came down the mountain when the stars were full. They dug horizontal ditches, cultivated embankments, built terraces, and planted trees on the mountain. The Daliang Mountain, a branch of Pailu Mountain, is a famous "hard mountain" here. The ground was so hard that the hoes and iron shovels were broken, and many blisters were worn on their hands, but everyone's fighting spirit became stronger and stronger. When planting trees, it was dry and did not rain, and no wet soil was seen a few feet deep on the top of the mountain, and there was no water source on the mountain. In order to ensure planting and survival, they dug tree pits during the day and went down the mountain at night to fetch water from several miles away to the mountain. They planted one plant and watered one plant, not letting a single sapling dry up. Under their tenacious and hard work, the newly planted saplings sprouted tender green branches and leaves one by one. At the same time, they also brought in vegetable seeds such as tomatoes and cucumbers that had never been grown locally and planted them in the terraced fields they had built. When a strong wind of magnitude five or six blew on the mountain, or when it rained, they encouraged each other to persist on the hills, braving the wind and rain to fight against soil and water loss disasters. No matter how heavy the rain was, it could not stop them. They adopted the method of "preparing before the rain and making a big assault after the rain" to seize the opportunity to repair, which accelerated the speed of managing barren mountains. After more than 70 days of hard work, they managed more than 2,000 mu of soil and water loss area on Daliang Mountain and planted more than 2,000 trees. Although there was a rainstorm in the autumn of that year, the flood on Daliang Mountain did not go down the mountain, and the soil did not go out of the ditch. The trees on the mountain were green, and the cucumbers grew a foot long. The barren appearance of Daliang Mountain has been changed under their skillful hands. Fa Lanying and many Hui sisters were rated as mountain management experts. People who did not believe that the barren mountain could be managed well were convinced. An old man named Ma Shanghai went to Daliang Mountain and was surprised to give a thumbs up and praised him repeatedly. He quickly went back to dig out a fruit tree from his garden and transplanted it on the mountain.

The highest mountain on Pailu Mountain is named "March 8th Mountain", which is contracted by women to manage. Girls in their teens and old ladies in their sixties and seventies all participated in the management of this "March 8th Mountain". Zhang Guihua, a 16-year-old girl, ran several times to apply to go to the mountain to manage the mountain. People saw that she was young and did not allow her to go to the mountain. She refused to accept and said, "You can manage the mountain even if you are young." Since she went to the mountain in November 1957, she has been living on the mountain with everyone. Last autumn, her mother was ill, and others persuaded her to go home for a few days, but she was always afraid of delaying the mountain management, so she repaired soil and water conservation projects on the mountain during the day and ran home to serve her mother after work in the afternoon. In the process of mountain management, she never showed weakness in front of male commune members, often challenging and competing with them, and many people could not catch up with her. Now, she has learned various soil and water conservation techniques, can survey the terrain, and can do various soil and water conservation projects according to local conditions and disaster prevention. In the autumn of 1959, Yang Qing, an old lady in her seventies, saw that the young people were very enthusiastic about managing the mountains, and she also couldn't sit still, so she climbed the mountain with everyone to plant trees. Everyone persuaded her to rest, but she said, "Don't look at me being old, I can do what others can do. I must plant trees on the mountain with my own hands and turn this dry mountain into an orchard." She worked with everyone for seven days. One day, a strong wind blew on the mountain, and even people could not be seen in the middle of the mountain, but she still insisted on planting more than 50 trees on "March 8th Mountain". The mountain management headquarters of the commune specially commended Yang's spirit, and the commune members also rated her as a special model for mountain management.

The heroines who skillfully embroidered the barren mountains are growing rapidly, and their heroic deeds are constantly being spread.

Traveling Through Mountains and Rivers to Collect Tree Seeds

The arid Pailu Mountain originally had only one dry elm tree on dozens of mountain tops. In the past, people called it the "wind pulse tree", meaning that only this "wind pulse tree" could survive here, and it was impossible to plant trees and afforest. In the entire county of 9,000 square kilometers, trees are also very scarce, and the annual rainfall is only more than 200 millimeters, which is not more than the sweat that farmers shed every year. The drinking water for people and animals is also rainwater and snow water stored in cellars. Therefore, to green this barren mountain, not only are trees not easy to survive, but also tree seeds and seedlings are very scarce. However, people did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties and came up with various ways to solve the problems of lack of tree seeds, seedlings, and water. At the beginning of the large-scale greening of barren mountains and barren gullies, the mountain management heroes did not avoid hardship. They brought their pots, stoves, and dry food, traveled through mountains and rivers, and trekked to the Guanshan Forest Area hundreds of miles away and the Ziwuling Forest Area in Gansu Province nearly a thousand miles away to collect tree seeds. When collecting tree seeds, the thorns in the mountains and forests pierced their hands and tore their clothes, but everyone was not discouraged, but became more tenacious. Sometimes they couldn't get food in the forest, and there were many wolves, insects, tigers, and leopards, so they ate wild fruits to fill their hunger and contacted each other in the forest by whistling. After the tree seeds were collected, they could not be transported out due to the inconvenient transportation in the mountains and forests. They carried the tree seeds in bags from the forest area dozens of miles away to the transportation line. Some commune members went to the shady and humid mountainous areas hundreds of miles away to dig up tree seedlings. In order to prevent the seedlings from drying out, they wrapped the roots of the seedlings with grass and wet soil, and then carried them back one by one with donkeys.

When planting trees in arid mountainous areas, the sunny side of the mountain is drier than the shady side of the mountain. In spring and summer, people first dig tree pits and horizontal ditches on the mountain to store water and conserve moisture, and plant trees in the autumn. Sometimes, this method does not work, so they simply move soil on the shady side of the mountain and plant trees on the sunny side of the mountain to ensure the survival of the trees. After the seedlings are planted, they transport the stored water from the foot of the mountain seven or eight miles away to the mountain in buckets by people carrying them, donkeys carrying them, and carts pulling them. Later, the scale of mountain management became larger and larger, and the speed became faster and faster. This method also did not work. Gao Yongxing, the captain of the mountain management infrastructure team, led 20 men and women team members and fought for a winter, bypassing seven or eight small mountain tops, and built a 15-mile mountain channel to divert the spring water under Nanhua Mountain to the arid Daliang Mountain. At the same time, many cellars were dug on the mountain to store water for use. Most of the newly planted trees have survived, and now some saplings have grown to be more than one person tall.

The Ever-Victorious Team for Building Mountain Areas

Managing such a barren mountain is an arduous and long-term struggle to transform nature. In order to make up their minds to manage the barren mountain well, people established a year-round mountain management infrastructure team starting in 1958. After the people's communes were established, due to the superiority of the people's communes, the mountain management infrastructure team quickly expanded. They are like an ever-victorious and invincible field army, braving the cold dew and wearing the blazing sun, fighting on barren mountains. Many people made a vow when they went up the mountain: eat on the mountain, live on the mountain, think on the mountain, and will not go down the mountain if they do not manage Pailu Mountain well. They dug caves on the mountain and lived on the mountain to manage the mountain. People who used to hate these barren mountains now love the barren mountains. Some couples even went up the mountain together, settled down on the mountain, and fought against the barren mountains all year round. Ma Farong, a Hui youth, and Ma Shengyue, a Hui girl, competed and helped each other in the long-term mountain management process, established love, and they got married on the mountain and became a new couple for mountain management.

After the mountain management infrastructure team lived on the mountain to manage the mountain, based on the experience of managing the barren mountain over the years, they also put forward the policy of "gardens on mountain tops, strip fields on gentle slopes, terraced fields in gullies and bays, and terraced fields for cultivated land" and the policy of managing and nurturing mountains and being self-sufficient and more than sufficient, and carried out a more magnificent large-scale movement to manage barren mountains and barren gullies than before. In 1959, they planted more than 490 mu of grass and trees on the mountain, and planted more than 210 mu of crops such as wheat, millet, broad beans, potatoes, and oil crops. The average yield was more than 200 jin, which was higher than the yield of the fields at the foot of the mountain. In October, five production teams at the foot of the mountain transferred more than 900 laborers to form a commando team to support the mountain. The year-round infrastructure team and the commando team launched a mountain management competition with each other, and managed more than 11,000 mu of soil and water loss area and planted more than 150,000 trees in more than a month. A gully has always been called the "harmful gully". From 1949 to 1951, vehicles and livestock were injured or killed many times because the road was washed away by the gully water. In 1953, the state built a highway bridge here, but it was washed away by floods in less than two years. The highway on the mountain was also rerouted many times because it was cut off by floods, so people called this gully the "road cut gully". In the autumn of 1959, the mountain management team members spent two and a half days to completely manage this gully and planted various fruit trees. The young people also planted evergreen cypress trees in the gully and named this gully "May Fourth Gully".

From these new mountains and gullies, grasses and trees, we can see how hot the feelings of the mountain management experts are.

The appearance of the barren mountain has changed, but people have not stopped moving forward. According to the management of this barren mountain, the people's commune has further made new long-term plans. This plan shows people a more beautiful picture: the South Mountain is a pasture, the East Mountain is a fruit mountain, the Pingchuan is a rice and grain field, and the South Beach is an oil field. The commune members are working harder to create this beautiful life. People believe that under the leadership of the Party, this beautiful picture will soon become a living reality.

    枯山开鲜花
    攀登上宁夏海原县城东拔海约两千米的牌路山，四下眺望，山腰里梯田和带子田层层叠叠，如栉似比；山顶和山坡上牧草与林木争艳，条条沟壑形成了整齐美观的台阶田、花果园。
    这是海原城关人民公社回汉族社员们以气壮山河的英雄气概，在短短的几年内，对一座面积四十平方公里，过去被风雨浸蚀得千疮百孔、草木不生的干枯的荒山治理以后的景象。传说，这座枯山原是海原县的“八景”之一，后来由于水土流失严重，连“山神”都蹲不住了，所以才遗害于后代的人们。“山穷显英雄，志大山低头”。现在，这座千年的枯山，经过毛泽东时代的人们的治理，开出了鲜花。
    巧绣荒山的女英雄
    说起治理牌路山，妇女们始终高举着鲜艳的红旗，昂首阔步地走在最前面。她们是治山的先锋队，也是巧绣荒山的能手。1958年春天大跃进开始，这里大面积的治山治水运动开始了。当时，春耕生产很紧迫，治山劳动力调动不开，党组织就提出一个口号：青年找水源，老人去种田，妇女上荒山。在这个口号的鼓舞下，妇女们蜂涌而来，成了治理荒山的主力军。她们没有治山治水的经验，也不懂得水土保持的技术，可是她们都天不怕、地不怕，带着治山的决心，雄鹰般地飞上了山岗。二十三岁的回族妇女法兰英，率领了二十名男女青年首先上阵。有些老年人不相信枯山能治好，说这些年青人是瞎胡闹。她们没理睬这些话，而以“治不好山心不甘”的豪语作了回答。她们每天天不明就上山，星满天才下山，在山上挖水平沟、培地埂、修梯田、植树造林。牌路山的支脉大梁山是这里有名的“硬山头”，地硬得把镢头、铁锨都挖坏了，手上也磨起了不少的水泡，但是每个人的斗志越来越坚强。植树时，天旱不下雨，山顶上挖几尺深不见湿土，山上又没有水源，她们为了保栽保活，白天挖好树窝，晚上就下山从几里路以外把水弄上山来，植一株，浇一株，不让一株树苗干枯。在她们顽强和辛苦的奋战下，新植的树苗一株株发出了嫩绿的枝叶。同时，她们还从外地弄来了当地从来没有种过的西红柿、黄瓜等蔬菜种，种在自己兴修的台阶田里。当山上刮起了五、六级的狂风，或者下起了雨，她们就互相勉励，坚持在山岗上顶着狂风、冒着雨同水土流失灾害作斗争。雨下得再大，也难不住她们，她们采取“雨前作准备，雨后大突击”的抢墒兴修的办法，反而加快了治理荒山的速度。经过七十多天的苦战，她们共治理了大梁山水土流失面积二千多亩，植树二千多株。当年秋天虽然下了一场暴雨，大梁山的洪水并没有下山，泥土也没有出沟，山上树木绿油油，黄瓜长的尺把长。大梁山的干枯面貌，在她们双手的巧绣下改观了。法兰英和许多回族妇女姐妹，都被评为治山能手。不相信枯山能治好的人们服贴了。一位马尚海老汉，走上大梁山一看，惊讶地翘起大姆指赞不绝口，连忙回去把自己园里的一棵果树挖出来，移植在山上。
    牌路山上最高的一个山头被命名为“三八山”，它是妇女们包下来治理的。十几岁的姑娘和六、七十岁的老太太都参加了治理这“三八山”的活动。十六岁的姑娘张桂花一连跑了好几次，申请上山治山。人们看她年纪小，不让上山，她不服地说：“年纪小也能治山”。她从1957年11月上山以来，一直和大伙生活在山上。去年秋天，她母亲有病，别人劝她回家住几天，她总怕耽误了治山的事，因此白天在山上修水土保持工程，下午收工后再跑回家侍候妈妈。在治山过程中，她从不在男社员面前示弱，经常和他们挑战竞赛，许多人都赶不上她。现在，她已经学会了各种水土保持技术，会测看地形，会因地制宜、因害设防地做各种水土保持工程。七十多岁的杨青老太太在1959年秋天，看到青年人治山的劲头很大，她也热腾腾地坐不定，和大伙一起爬上山去植树。大家劝她歇息，她说：“别看我年纪大，别人能办到的我也能办到，我一定要在山上亲手栽活树，叫这干山变成花果园”。她和大家一起干了七天，有一天山上刮起大风，山腰里连人都看不见，她仍然在“三八山”上坚持植树五十多株。公社治山指挥部特地表彰了杨老太太的这种精神，社员们还把她评为治山特等模范。
    巧绣荒山的女英雄们迅速地成长着，她们的英雄事迹不断地被传颂着。
    跋山涉水采树种
    干旱的牌路山，原来几十个山头仅有一棵干榆树，过去人们称它为“风脉树”，意思就是唯有这株“风脉树”能在这里成活，要植树造林是不可能的。在全县九千平方公里的范围内，树木也很稀少，年雨量也只有二百多毫米，并不比农民每年流的汗水多。人畜的饮水，也都是打窖蓄起来的雨水和雪水。因此，要绿化这座干枯的荒山，不仅树木不容易成活，就是树种和树苗也很奇缺。但是，人们并没有在困难面前低头，想出各种各样的办法，解决了缺树种、树苗和缺水的问题。在大规模的绿化荒山、荒沟一开始，治山英雄们就不避艰苦，带上锅灶和干粮，跋山涉水、翻山越岭到几百里路以外的关山林区和近千里路的甘肃子午岭林区采集树种。采树种的时候，山林中的荆棘刺破了双手，挂破了衣衫，大家并不气馁，而是更加顽强。林区内有时吃不上饭，狼虫虎豹很多，他们就吃野果充饥，互相在林中呼哨联系。树种采到手以后，由于山林交通不便，运不出来，他们就一袋一袋从几十里路以外的林区，把树种背到交通线上。有的社员到上百里路以外的阴湿山区挖树苗，为了不让树苗干枯，他们就用草和湿土把树苗根包起来，然后一个一个用毛驴驮回来。
    在干旱山区植树，同是一座山，阳山比阴山更干旱。春夏季节，人们先在山上挖下树窝和水平沟，蓄水保墒，到了秋后植树。有时，这个办法还行不通，他们就干脆在阴山上搬土，在阳山上植树，保证树木成活。树苗栽上以后，又从七、八里路以外的山下，把蓄下的水用人担、驴驮、车拉的办法，一桶一桶运上山来浇树。后来，治山的规模越来越大，速度越来越快，这种办法也不行了，治山基建队队长高永兴就带了二十名男女队员，大战了一个冬天，绕过七、八座小山头，修筑了一条十五华里的盘山渠道，把南华山下的泉水引到干旱的大梁山上。同时，又在山上打许多窖，蓄水备用。新植的树木大都成活了，现在有些树苗已经长到一人多高了。
    建设山区的常胜队
    治理这样干枯的荒山，是一个艰巨而长期的改造自然的斗争。人们为了下决心把荒山治好，从1958年开始，就建立了长年治山基建队。人民公社化以后，由于人民公社的优越性，这个治山基建队队伍又迅速扩大。他们好像一支攻无不克、战无不胜的野战军，披寒露、戴炎阳，转战荒山。许多人在上山时就立下了誓言：吃在山住在山，思想上了山，治不好牌路山不下山。他们在山上挖了窑洞，住山治山。过去厌恶这些荒山的人，现在也爱上了荒山。有的夫妇还一起上山，在山上安家落户，常年与荒山展开搏斗。回族青年马发荣和回族姑娘马生月，在常年的治山过程中，互相竞赛，互相帮助，建立了爱情，他们就在山上结了婚，成为治山的新夫妇。
    治山基建队住山治山以后，根据历年来治理荒山的经验，又提出了“山头修花园，缓坡带子田，沟湾台阶地，耕地修梯田”以及治山养山、自给有余的方针，开展了声势比以前更加壮阔的大面积治理荒山和荒沟的运动。1959年，他们在山上共种草木栖四百九十多亩，种小麦、糜子、莞豆、洋芋和油料等作物二百一十多亩，平均产量都在二百斤以上，比山下的田地产量还高。10月间，山下的五个生产队又抽调了九百多劳动力组成突击队上山支援。长年基建队和突击队互相展开了治山竞赛，在一个多月内就治理了水土流失面积一万一千多亩，植树十五万多株。有一条沟一直被人们称为“害人沟”，从1949年到1951年，就因为道路被沟水冲毁，行路的车辆和牲畜曾经多次摔伤或摔死。1953年国家在这里修了一座公路桥，没到两年又被洪水冲坏了，山上的公路也因为被洪水冲断而改线多次，所以人们又称这条沟为“断路沟”。1959年秋，治山队员用两天半的时间把这条沟全部治理好，栽上各种各样的果树。青年们在沟里还植了四季常青的柏树，并把这条沟命名为“五四沟”。
    从这些新的一山一沟，一草一木，可以看出治山的能手们有着多么灼热的心情。
    荒山的面貌改观了，但是人们并没有停止前进的脚步。人民公社根据这座枯山治理情况，又进一步作出了新的远景规划。这个规划给人们展示了一幅更加美丽的图景：南山是牧场，东山花果山，平川米粮川，南滩是油田。社员们正在为缔造这美丽的生活而更加勤奋地劳动着。人们相信，在党的领导下，这美丽的图景即将变成活生生的现实。  本报记者　　马玉平，王得温（附图片）
