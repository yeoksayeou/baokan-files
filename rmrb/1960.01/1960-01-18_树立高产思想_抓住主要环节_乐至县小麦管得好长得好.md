Establish a High-Yield Ideology, Grasping the Main Links
Lezhi County Manages Wheat Well and It Grows Well

(Our report) Lezhi County, Sichuan Province, a famous high-yield wheat county, has launched a vigorous "Three Highs, Three Catch-ups, Four Nones, and Wheat Transformed into First-Class Seedlings" field management campaign to seize a bumper wheat harvest. "Three Highs": Establish a high-yield ideology, adhere to high quality, and carry out high work efficiency; "Three Catch-ups": Backward areas catch up with advanced areas, general land catches up with high-yield land, and third-class seedlings catch up with first-class seedlings; "Four Nones": No weak seedlings, no weeds, no pests, no lodging. By the beginning of January, the county's 200,000 mu of wheat had generally been top-dressed three times, pest control carried out three times, and soil cultivated and earthed up once. Now the seedling structure is growing better than in the same period last year. In more than 60,000 mu of high-yield wheat land, general tillering is three or more roots, with a plant height of about eight inches; general land tillering is two roots, with a plant height of five or six inches. According to a recent inspection, first-class seedlings account for 58.1%, second-class seedlings account for 36.9%, and third-class seedlings account for only 5%. The Sichuan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held a wheat on-site meeting here. A total of more than 30,000 people from 116 counties in the province came to visit. Everyone praised the wheat here as "one specification, one seedling structure, one color." Whether in the mountains, hills, or plains, the wheat seedlings are green, strong, and thriving.

Winning the first battle of the small spring crops, taking the initiative, advancing victoriously, using the small spring crops to promote the large spring crops, and completing the annual production increase plan is an important experience for Lezhi County in continuing the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1959. In order to achieve a better leap forward in 1960, the county began to focus on the sowing of small spring crops, especially wheat, at the beginning of the "Four Autumns" campaign in 1959, expanding the sowing area while improving the sowing quality. The sowing area of small spring crops was expanded by 43% compared with last year. High-yield wheat land is generally deep-plowed to a depth of 1.5 chi [~1.5 feet], 50,000 jin [~25 tons] of base fertilizer is applied, and 30 jin [~15 kg] of seeds are used; general land is deep-plowed to a depth of 8 cun to 1 chi [~0.67 to 1 foot], 20,000 to 30,000 jin [~10 to 15 tons] of base fertilizer is applied, and 20 to 25 jin [~10 to 12.5 kg] of seeds are used. All adopted the technical specifications of eight-chi compartment opening, deep ditch high ridge, and wide-row strip sowing. After completing the sowing work, the Party committees at all levels immediately shifted the focus of their leadership to field management. Through comparative education with typical cases, they promptly corrected the thinking of a few cadres and the masses who believed that "high sowing quality can still lead to a bumper harvest even with slightly poor management; a wide sowing area is difficult to manage," and helped the broad masses of commune members establish the concept of "equal emphasis on sowing and management." Cadres at the county, district, and commune levels established 50,000 mu of demonstration plots, participated in production, and led production. At the same time, they also adopted the method of layer-by-layer contracting to strengthen grassroots leadership. The county transferred more than 500 cadres to backward and remote areas, established more than 100 demonstration plots in low-yield areas, and five county party secretaries were stationed on the front line of production for a long time to strengthen specific leadership. Combined with carrying out field management competitions, timely held on-site meetings for good and bad comparisons, driving the backward and promoting the advanced. The county, district, and commune levels have held 1,022 field management on-site meetings and established more than 500 pacesetters. With the help and encouragement of the Party committees, the backward units worked hard and caught up quickly. With the in-depth development of the "Three Catch-ups" campaign, the level of wheat field management has been continuously improved. The number of teams with backward wheat field management has dropped from the initial 5.7% of the total to 2.7%. In the county's 52 communes, 11 communes, 143 management districts, and 1,173 production teams have basically achieved first-class seedling status.

Another important reason why Lezhi County's wheat field management work has been particularly outstanding this year is that, based on the new situation this year, they have absorbed the experience of last year and effectively solved the following five problems:

	(1) Solving the labor problem from two aspects. One is to implement labor delineation, and the county has established 3,395 wheat field management professional teams, establishing a one-package-to-the-end responsibility system; for some tasks that are time-sensitive and have a large workload, a combination of professional teams and mass movements is adopted to implement large-scale blitz. The other is to vigorously reform tools and carry out high work efficiency campaigns. High work efficiency groups have been established in each field management professional team as the core of tool reform. The tools used for several important tasks in field management have been greatly improved. For example, soil cultivation has been changed from hand-spreading to sieve-mouth, fertilizer transportation has been changed from shoulder carrying to vehicle transportation, and watering has been changed from shoulder carrying to self-flowing irrigation and waterwheel irrigation. Since last winter, 220 kilometers of field transportation roads have been built, and more than 14,100 new chicken carts and frame carts have been built, which have doubled labor efficiency.

	(2) More fertilizer is accumulated and used skillfully. In addition to applying sufficient base fertilizer to wheat fields, the county has also prepared 5 billion jin [~2.5 million tons] of special fertilizer for wheat topdressing, which is twice as much as last year. Now the fertilizer accumulation campaign in various communes is continuing to deepen, and it is planned to accumulate another 3.5 billion jin [~1.75 million tons] of fertilizer for wheat before the Awakening of Insects [around March 5th], to ensure that high-yield wheat land is top-dressed six times and general land is top-dressed three times. In the use of fertilizer, the combination of rational fertilization and economical use of fertilizer is achieved. The method is to combine "eat less and more often" with heavy application of jointing fertilizer and heading fertilizer, so as to achieve "five looks" fertilization (look at soil quality, look at seedlings, look at climate, look at varieties, look at fertilizer), pay attention to the rational combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers, with nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers as the main fertilizers in the early stage, and heavy application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers in the branching and differentiation stage.

	(3) Rational use of water. Lezhi County has a historical spring drought, and the severe spring drought that occurred last year had a great impact on wheat production. Since last winter, more than 90,000 new water storage ponds have been built in the corners of the fields, plus the original ones, which can store more than 14 million cubic meters of water. In addition, the newly built medium-sized and small water conservancy projects also adopt the method of storing water while using it, which has reserved a large amount of water for small spring crops. It is planned to irrigate high-yield wheat land eight times and general wheat land three times. As soon as the drought recently emerged, the county broke with convention and launched a mass winter irrigation campaign.

	(4) Pest prevention and control. Resolutely implement the policy of "early treatment, universal treatment, continuous treatment, and thorough treatment" to achieve prevention is more important than treatment. A total of 425 pesticide factories have been established in the county, and more than 10 million jin [~5,000 tons] of local pesticides have been produced, and pest control has been carried out three times.

	(5) Prevent lodging. Under the slogan of "prevent lodging from the beginning, and prevent lodging throughout," comprehensive management measures have been adopted. For example, during the sowing period, the land should be deeply plowed carefully, good varieties should be selected, sufficient base fertilizer should be applied, and reasonable close planting should be carried out; during the field management period, the soil should be earthed up in advance, and reasonable topdressing should be carried out. At present, no steep growth or lodging has been found in wheat. (Attached picture)

    树立高产思想　抓住主要环节
    乐至县小麦管得好长得好
    本报讯　四川省著名小麦高产县——乐至县，为夺取小麦大丰收，掀起了一个热火朝天的“三高、三赶、四无、小麦一类苗化”田间管理运动。“三高”：树立高产思想，坚持高质量，开展高工效；“三赶”：落后区赶先进区，一般地赶高产地，三类苗赶一类苗；“四无”：无弱苗，无杂草，无虫害，无倒伏。到1月初，全县二十万亩小麦已普遍追肥三次，治虫三次，中耕培土一次。现在苗架生长得比去年同期好，六万多亩小麦高产地一般分蘖三根以上，株高八寸左右；一般地分蘖两根，株高五、六寸。根据最近检查，全县一类苗占58．1％，二类苗占36．9％，三类苗只占5％。中共四川省委曾在这里召开小麦现场会，全省有一百一十六个县共三万多人先后赶来参观，大家称赞这里的小麦是“一个规格、一个苗架、一个颜色。”全县不论山上山下，丘陵平坝，麦苗都是青绿茁壮，欣欣向荣。
    打好小春第一仗，取得主动，乘胜前进，用小春促大春，完成全年增产计划，是1959年乐至县领导农业生产继续大跃进的一项重要经验。为了实现1960年更好的跃进，该县在1959年“四秋”运动一开始，就抓紧小春特别是小麦的播种工作，一面扩大播种面积，一面提高播种质量。小春作物播种面积比去年扩大43％。小麦高产地一般深耕一尺五寸，施底肥五万斤，用种三十斤；一般地深耕八寸到一尺，施底肥二到三万斤，用种二十到二十五斤，全部采用八尺开厢、深沟高埂、宽幅条播的技术规格。在完成播种工作后，各级党委立即把领导重心转向田间管理。他们通过典型事例的对比教育，及时纠正了少数干部和群众认为“播种质量高，管理差点也能大丰收；播种面积宽，不好管理”等思想，帮助广大社员树立了“种管并重”的观念。县、区、社各级干部建立了指挥田五万亩，参加生产，领导生产。同时还采取层层包干的办法，加强基层领导。全县下放了五百多名干部到落后偏僻地区，在低产区建立了一百多处指挥田，五个县委书记都长期驻守生产第一线，加强具体领导。结合开展田间管理竞赛，及时召开好坏对比现场会，带动落后，促进先进。县、区、社三级已召开田间管理现场会一千零二十二次，树立标兵五百多个。各落后单位在党委的帮助和鼓舞下，发奋图强，急起直追。随着“三赶”运动的深入开展，小麦田间管理水平不断提高。麦田管理落后队已由最初占总数5．7％下降到2．7％，在全县五十二个公社中有十一个社、一百四十三个管区、一千一百七十三个生产队基本实现了一类苗化。
    乐至县今年麦田管理工作做得特别出色的另一个重要原因是，根据今年新情况，吸取了去年的经验，切实解决了下列五个问题：
      （1）从两方面下手解决劳力问题。一是实行劳力划线，全县建立小麦田间管理专业队三千三百九十五个，建立一包到底的责任制度；对于一些时间性强、工作量大的活路，采用专业队与群众运动相结合的办法，实行大兵团突击。另一个是大力改革工具，开展高工效运动。各田间管理专业队中成立了高工效小组，作为改革工具的核心。田间管理工作几项重要活路使用的工具，都有很大改进。如改培土手撒为筛口，运肥改肩挑为车运，浇水改担挑为自流灌溉和车水浇灌。去冬以来，兴修田间运输车道二百二十公里，新造鸡公车、架子车一万四千一百多部，成倍地提高了劳动效率。
      （2）肥料积得多，用得巧。全县除给麦田施足底肥外，还为小麦追肥准备了专用肥料五十亿斤，比去年增加两倍。现在各公社的积肥运动还在继续深入开展，计划在惊蛰前再为小麦积肥三十五亿斤，保证小麦高产地施追肥六次、一般地施三次。在肥料使用上，做到合理施肥与节约用肥相结合。办法是“少吃多餐”和重施拔节肥、孕穗肥相结合，作到“五看”施肥（看土质、看苗稼、看气候、看品种、看肥料），注意氮、磷、钾肥合理配合，前期以氮、磷肥为主，枝节分化期重施磷、钾肥。
      （3）合理用水。乐至县有历史性春旱，去年发生的严重春旱对小麦产量影响很大。去冬以来，全县在田边地角新建蓄水池九万多个，加上原有的共可蓄水一千四百多万方。另外，新建的中小型水利工程也采取边蓄水边使用的办法，给小春储备了大量用水。计划高产麦地灌水八次，一般麦地灌水三次。最近干旱刚一露头，全县就打破常规开展群众性的冬灌运动。
    （4）防虫治虫。坚决贯彻“早治、普遍治、连续治、彻底治”的方针，做到防重于治。全县共办农药厂四百二十五个，已生产土农药一千多万斤，普遍治虫三次。
    （5）防止倒伏。在“一开始就防倒、自始至终都防倒”的口号下，采取了综合治理的办法。如在播种期间认真深翻土地，选用良种，重施底肥，合理密植；田间管理期间，提前培土，合理追肥。现在小麦没有发现陡长或倒伏的迹象。（附图片）
