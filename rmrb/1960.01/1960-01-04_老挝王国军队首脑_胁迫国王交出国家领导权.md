Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 3rd: According to a series of communiques broadcast by the Vientiane Radio Station on the evening of January 2nd, the heads of the Lao Kingdom Army further forced the King of Laos to hand over "national leadership" on January 2nd. According to the communique, the Commander-in-Chief of the Lao Kingdom Army, Sounthone Pathammavong, made this request to the King on January 2nd. The King of Laos has agreed to hand over national leadership to the General Headquarters of the Lao Kingdom Army from January 2nd.

Another communique announced that the General Headquarters of the Lao Kingdom Army convened a meeting on the same day with the heads of divisions, bureaus, and sections under various government ministries. Pathammavong said that from now on, all ministries and institutions will be under the leadership of the Army General Headquarters. Pathammavong also announced in the communique that all bills recently discussed and passed by the Lao National Assembly are invalid.

As previously reported, the extremely pro-American "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" of Laos and the heads of the Kingdom's army dispatched troops and tanks to demonstrate in Vientiane at the end of last year, and placed the Kingdom's government, the National Assembly, and the palace under guard, subsequently seizing power in Laos.

    老挝王国军队首脑
    胁迫国王交出国家领导权
    新华社河内3日电　据万象电台2日晚间广播的老挝王国军队总司令部发表的一系列的公报，老挝王国军队的首脑们2日进一步迫使老挝国王交出了“国家领导权”。据公报说，老挝王国军队总司令顺吞·巴坦马冯2日向国王提出了这个要求。老挝国王已经同意从2日起把国家领导权交给老挝王国军队总司令部。
    另一项公报宣布，老挝王国军队总司令部在当天召集了政府各部所属司、局、科的负责人举行会议。巴坦马冯说，今后，各部、各机关都置于军队总司令部的领导下。巴坦马冯还在公报中宣布，老挝国民议会最近讨论和通过的一切议案都是无效的。
    前已报道，极端亲美的老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”和王国军队的首脑们，在去年年底出动了军队、坦克在万象举行示威，并把王国政府、国民议会和皇宫看守起来，随后攫取了老挝政权。
