    Xinhua News Agency, January 19th: News Communiqué on the Visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of China
    (January 19, 1960)
    At the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of the China, the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Heinrich Rau, member the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, paid a friendly visit to the People's Republic of China from January 9th to 19th, 1960. The delegation members included: Paul Verner, alternate member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and First Secretary of the Berlin District Committee, Otto Winzer, member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, First Deputy Foreign Minister and State Secretary, and Paul Wandel, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Germany Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of China.
    The government delegation of German Democratic Republic visited industrial enterpries, people's communes, and scientific and cultural institutions in Beijing, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, and Shanghai, and received very warm welcome from the people everywhere, and witnessed the tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction.
    Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, met with the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, held detailed talks, and exchanged views extensively on international issues of mutual concern and the socialist construction of the two countries, reaching a complete consensus.
    Both sides emphasized that the West German militarism and Japanese militarism, which have been revived under the fostering of the United States, pose a serious threat to world peace.
    This danger is currently exacerbated by the role of West German militarists as planners of aggression in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the imminent conclusion of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.
    Both sides agreed that the atomic armament carried out by West German militarists and Japanese militarists with the support of the United States aims to oppose the relaxation of the international situation and is incompatible with the interests of all peace-loving people. Both sides unanimously stated that they will wage unremitting struggle against this act that seriously endangers peace and to safeguard world peace.
    The Soviet proposal for universal disarmament conforms to the will of all peace-loving people. Both sides expressed the hope that the upcoming summit conference will reach an agreement on specific measures for disarmament based on the Soviet proposal. The People's Republic of China supports the position of the German Democratic Republic that the summit conference should resolve the issues of concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanys and normalizing the situation in West Berlin with the participation of German representatives.
    During the visit of government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of China, the two sides held talks on further strengthening economic cooperation between the two countries.
    The German Democratic Republic side participating in the talks included:
    Members of the government delegation: Heinrich Rau, Paul Verner, Otto Winzer, Paul Wandel, and economic experts: Werner Dürberger, Director of the Department of Foreign and Inner-German Trade, and Fritz Nobert, Commercial Counselor of the German Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of China.
    The People's Republic of China side participating in the talks included:
    Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council, Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lin Haiyun, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, Liu Mingfu, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, and Wu Heng, Deputy Director of the State Science and Technology Commission.
    As a result of the talks, the two countries signed the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, and the Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the German Republic on the Exchange of Goods from 1960 to 1962.
    Both sides are deeply convinced that the visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic and the signing of the above-mentioned treaty and agreement have made new contributions to the further strengthening of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.

    中德双方在德政府代表团访华公报中强调团结一致坚持斗争
    反对美国复活西德和日本军国主义
    双方指出苏联普遍裁军建议符合爱好和平人民的意志，希望首脑会议对裁军具体措施取得协议
    中国支持德意志民主共和国的立场，首脑会议应该吸收德国代表参加解决缔结对德和约等问题
    新华社19日讯　关于德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问中华人民共和国的新闻公报
    （1960年1月19日）
    以德国统一社会党中央政治局委员、德意志民主共和国副总理海因里希·劳为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团应中华人民共和国政府的邀请，自1960年1月9日至19日在中华人民共和国进行了友好访问。代表团成员有：德国统一社会党中央政治局候补委员、大柏林专区党委第一书记保罗·维尔纳，德国统一社会党中央委员、外交部第一副部长、国务秘书奥托·文策尔和德意志民主共和国驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使保罗·汪戴尔。
    德意志民主共和国政府代表团在北京，郑州，武汉和上海等地访问了工业企业，人民公社以及科学文化机构，受到了各地人民的非常热烈的欢迎，并看到了中国人民在共产党领导下在社会主义建设大跃进中取得的巨大成就。
    中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东，中华人民共和国主席刘少奇和中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来接见了德意志民主共和国政府代表团，并进行了详细的会谈，就双方关心的国际问题和两国的社会主义建设问题广泛地交换了意见，取得了完全一致的看法。
    双方强调指出，在美国扶植下已经复活的西德军国主义和日本军国主义，是对世界和平的严重危险。
    这种危险目前由于西德军国主义者在北大西洋公约集团中扮演了策划侵略的角色和即将签订的日美军事同盟条约而更加加剧了。
    双方一致认为，西德军国主义者和日本军国主义者在美国支持下进行的原子武装，旨在反对国际局势的缓和，是和所有爱好和平人民的利益不相容的。双方一致表示，他们将为反对这种严重危害和平的行径，为保障世界和平而进行不懈的斗争。
    苏联关于普遍裁军的建议符合于所有爱好和平人民的意志。双方表示，希望即将召开的首脑会议根据苏联的建议对裁军的具体措施取得协议。中华人民共和国支持德意志民主共和国的立场，即首脑会议应该在吸收德国代表参加的情况下，解决同两个德国缔结和约和使西柏林局势正常化的问题。
    在德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问中华人民共和国期间，双方曾就进一步加强两国之间的经济合作进行了会谈。
    德意志民主共和国方面参加会谈的有：
    政府代表团成员：海因里希·劳，保罗·维尔纳，奥托·文策尔，保罗·汪戴尔以及经济专家：对外和东西德贸易部司长维尔纳·杜尔伯和德意志民主共和国驻中华人民共和国商务参赞弗利茨·诺伯特。
    中华人民共和国方面参加会谈的有：
    国务院副总理李先念，外交部副部长曾涌泉，对外贸易部副部长林海云，国家计划委员会副主任刘明夫和国家科学技术委员会副主任武衡。
    会谈的结果，两国签订了中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国通商航海条约以及中华人民共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府关于1960年至1962年交换货物协定。
    双方深信，德意志民主共和国政府代表团的访问和上述条约和协定的签订对两国友好合作关系的进一步加强作出了新的贡献。
