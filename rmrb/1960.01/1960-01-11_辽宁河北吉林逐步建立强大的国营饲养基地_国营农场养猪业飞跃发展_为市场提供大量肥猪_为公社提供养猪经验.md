    Liaoning, Hebei, and Jilin Gradually Establish Strong State-Owned Breeding Bases
    State-Owned Farms' Pig Farming Industry Achieves Rapid Development
    Providing Large Quantities of Fat Pigs to the Market; Providing Pig-Raising Experience to Communes
    This newspaper reports: Over the past year, the pig farming industry in state-owned farms across Liaoning Province has experienced rapid development. By the end of 1959, the eighty-two state-owned farms in the province had raised more than 197,000 pigs, a threefold increase compared to the end of 1958. Due to the significant increase in the number of pigs raised, state-owned farms have become strong and powerful breeding and meat production bases. In 1959, state-owned farms across the province provided more than 6.57 million jin of commercial meat to the state, a 2.16-fold increase compared to the same period last year.
    Large-scale pig farming in state-owned farms in Liaoning Province is a new undertaking. In the past, state-owned farms primarily focused on producing commercial grain. This year, following instructions from higher-level Party committees, state-owned farms shifted to an operational policy focused on producing non-staple food, and then began large-scale pig farming. To solve the difficulty of insufficient pig sources, various farms generally adopted the "self-breeding and self-raising" approach, expanding sow herds and improving reproduction rates. In 1959, the number of sows on farms throughout the province increased from 13,500 at the beginning of the year to 53,700, with an additional 42,000 gilts, basically achieving the original plan of one sow per hectare of land. State-owned farms have significant advantages in resolving pig feed issues. This year, state-owned farms throughout the province planted a total of 180,000 hectares of green and succulent feed crops, producing more than 500 million jin of feed. Most farms can achieve self-sufficiency in feed. In terms of feed utilization, the focus is on coarse feed, making extensive use of previously discarded corn cobs, sorghum stalks, and bean stalks. After crushing and processing, coarse feed is refined, making it very palatable to pigs. Many experiences have also been gained in pig feeding management and disease prevention and hygiene. Pig farms in state-owned farms throughout the province have basically eradicated swine fever and controlled the occurrence of infectious diseases.
    This newspaper reports: By mid-December 1959, the thirty-six state-owned farms and ranches in Hebei Province had raised more than 170,000 pigs, a 2.5-fold increase compared to the beginning of the year, and sold more than 53,900 fat pigs to the state throughout the year.
    The great development of pig farming in these farms and ranches not only greatly reduced agricultural production costs and increased crop yields, but also increased the profits of most farms. Coastal saline-alkali land farms, mainly producing rice, previously relied mainly on the state for the supply of chemical fertilizers. In 1959, due to more pigs and more fertilizer, and the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," the yield per mu increased to 567 jin, an increase of 63.4% compared to 1958.
    Coastal farms and ranches mainly produce rice, and the unit area yield of feed in pastures north of the Great Wall is relatively low, so large-scale pig farming lacks feed. However, after mobilizing the masses, the problem was basically solved by using the four methods of "planting, collecting, grazing, and using." "Planting" means planting feed crops, increasing the area of multiple cropping, planting more high-yield feed crops, and increasing the total yield per mu. For example, after planting barley this year, Baoding Livestock Farm planted squash, and then planted carrots. The yield per mu of barley was more than 400 jin, squash was 5,000 jin, and carrots were 10,000 jin. Some also plant kohlrabi, sugar beets, etc., twice, three times, or four times a year, and each mu can harvest 20,000 to 40,000 jin. "Collecting" means collecting all wild plants that can be used as pig feed. "Grazing" means organizing pig herds to graze in the fields in a planned manner. Farms such as Sino-Czech Friendship, Baigezhuang, and Jinghai have increased the feeding management quota by 30% to 50% through grazing. "Using" means comprehensively utilizing all crop stalks, stems, leaves, and by-products after grain processing, as well as agricultural and sideline products from sugar, oil, and wine workshops, to refine fine feed and refine coarse feed to improve quality.
    Most of the state-owned farms and ranches in Hebei Province have established close ties with nearby people's communes. In the past, they played a significant guiding role in the commune's pig-raising cause in terms of promoting the scientific breeding and feeding experience of improved pig breeds.
    This newspaper reports: Animal husbandry, centered on pig raising, has achieved rapid development in state-owned farms and ranches in Jilin Province. Pig raising on farms throughout the province has developed to 45,000 heads, an increase of 1.5 times compared to the beginning of the year. While pigs have developed significantly, various livestock and poultry production has also seen great development.
    In 1959, state-owned farms in Jilin Province built and expanded more than 140 pig farms, and the number of pig farms with more than 1,000 heads increased from two in 1958 to twenty.
    With pig raising as the center, vigorously developing animal husbandry, the key lies in strengthening leadership. Many farms put pig raising in the first place, with the secretary taking the lead, the farm director taking action, planting experimental fields, gaining experience, and promoting it through professional meetings; and ensuring regular inspections, finding problems and solving them in a timely manner, ensuring the great development of the pig-raising industry. The Party Committee Secretary of the Zhenlai State-Owned Farm directly grasped pig raising, and the Deputy Secretary took the lead in the pig farm, enriching the pig raising team with party members, league members, and ideologically progressive workers as breeders.
    All farms have achieved "four grasps," namely grasping breeding, grasping feed, grasping disease prevention, and grasping feeding management. State-owned farms have developed animal husbandry with pig raising as the center. In 1959, they not only completed the production tasks of non-staple foods, but also promoted mutual promotion of agriculture and animal husbandry, and played a demonstrative role in the farms. According to statistics, the number of fat pigs sold by state-owned farms in 1959 increased by 2.1 times compared to 1958, meat chickens increased by twelve times, export ducks increased by 9.6 times, egg sales increased by thirteen times, milk increased by 54%, and wool increased by 37%.
    Due to the great development of animal husbandry, manure fertilizer has increased, and grain production in 1959 has also increased greatly compared to 1958. According to estimates, state-owned farms accumulated more than 20,000 tons of high-quality fertilizer in 1959 due to the increase in the number of pigs raised, which can increase grain production by about 1,000 tons.

    辽宁河北吉林逐步建立强大的国营饲养基地
    国营农场养猪业飞跃发展
    为市场提供大量肥猪　为公社提供养猪经验
    本报讯　辽宁省各地国营农场一年来，养猪事业有了飞跃发展。全省八十二个国营农场，截至1959年年底，养猪十九万七千多头，比1958年年末增加两倍。由于养猪数量大大增加，国营农场已经成为强大而有力的饲养基地和肉食品生产基地。1959年各地国营农场为国家提供商品肉六百五十七万多斤，比去年同时期提高二点一六倍。
    辽宁省国营农场大量养猪是一件新的工作。过去，国营农场都是以生产商品粮为主。今年根据上级党委指示，国营农场改为以生产副食品为主的经营方针以后，才开始大量养猪。为了解决猪源不足的困难，各农场普遍采取了“自繁自养”的方针，扩大母猪群，提高了繁殖率。1959年全省农场的母猪头数已由年初的一万三千五百头增加到五万三千七百头，另外还有小母猪四万二千多头，基本上实现了原订一公顷土地一头母猪的计划。国营农场在解决养猪饲料方面，具有很大的优越条件。全省各国营农场今年总共种了十八万公顷青绿、多汁饲料，共产饲料五亿余斤，大部分农场都可以做到饲料自给自足。在饲料利用上，采取以粗料为主，大量利用了过去废弃的玉米骨子、高粱荛子、豆秸等，经过粉碎加工，粗料细做，猪很爱吃。对猪的饲养管理和防疫卫生方面也都取得了很多经验。全省国营农场的猪场，已经基本上消灭了猪瘟，控制了传染性疫病的发生。
    本报讯　河北省三十六个国营农牧场，到1959年12月中旬，共养猪十七万多头，较年初增加两倍半，全年卖给国家肥猪五万三千九百多头。
    这些农牧场养猪业大发展，不仅大大减低了农业生产成本，提高了农作物的产量，而且绝大多数场的盈利增加。以水稻为主的各沿海盐碱地农场，过去主要依靠国家供应化学肥料，1959年由于猪多肥多，农业“八字宪法”的全面贯彻，每亩产量提高到五百六十七斤，较1958年增产63．4％。
    沿海农牧场因以水稻为主，坝上牧场饲料单位面积产量较低，因此大量养猪就缺乏饲料，但经过发动群众，用“种、采、牧、用”四法齐下，基本上解决了问题。“种”即种植饲料作物，增加复种面积，多种高产饲料作物，提高亩产总量。如保定畜牧场今年种植大麦后，接着种窝瓜，再种胡萝?，大麦亩产四百多斤，窝瓜五千斤，胡萝卜一万斤。还有的种根大菜、甜菜等，一年两作、三作、四作，每亩可收二到四万斤。“采”是采集一切可作猪饲料的野生植物。“牧”是有计划的组织猪群到田间放牧。中捷友谊、柏各庄、静海等农场，经过放牧提高了饲养管理定额30％到50％。“用”是综合利用一切作物秸秆、茎、叶和粮食加工后的副产品，糖、油、酒作坊的农副产品，做到细料细作，粗料细作，提高质量。
    河北省各国营农牧场大多数已经和附近的人民公社建立了密切联系，过去在推广优良猪种的科学繁殖、饲养经验方面，对公社养猪事业起了很大指导作用。
    本报讯　吉林省国营农牧场以养猪为中心的畜牧业获得飞跃发展。全省农场养猪已发展到四万五千头，比年初增加了一倍半。在猪大量发展的同时，各项畜禽生产也有了很大发展。
    1959年，吉林省国营农场新建和扩建养猪场一百四十多处，千头以上的猪场由1958年的两处增加到二十处。
    以养猪为中心，大力发展畜牧业，关键在于加强领导。许多农场把养猪排到首位，书记挂帅，场长出马，种试验田，取得经验，通过专业会议加以推广；并且做到经常检查，发现问题及时解决，保证了养猪业的大发展。国营镇赉农场党委书记直接抓养猪，副书记在养猪场挂帅，给养猪队充实党员、团员和思想进步的工人作饲养员。
    各农场都做到“四抓”，即抓繁殖，抓饲料，抓防疫，抓饲养管理。国营农场由于以养猪为中心发展了畜牧业，1959年既完成了副食品的生产任务，也作到农牧业互相促进，发挥了农场的示范作用。据统计，国营农场1959年出售的肥猪，比1958年增长了二点一倍，肉鸡增长十二倍，出口鸭子增长九点六倍，出售蛋品增长十三倍，牛奶增长54％，羊毛增长37％。
    由于畜牧业大发展，粪肥增加，1959年粮食产量也比1958年大为增加。据估算，国营农场1959年由于养猪数量增加就多积攒两万多吨优质肥料，可以增产一千吨左右的粮食。
