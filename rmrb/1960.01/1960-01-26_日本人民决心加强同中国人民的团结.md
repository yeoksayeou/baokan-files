    Japanese People Determined to Strengthen Solidarity with the Chinese People
    Kaoru Ota, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan
    Amidst the storm-like protests and opposition from the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people, the Kishi Nobusuke group sneaked out of Japan like thieving cats. They signed the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in Washington. Now, the struggle of the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people against this treaty has entered an extremely urgent and significant new stage. However, through the struggles so far, we have strengthened our confidence in victory. The Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people are maximizing their struggle in order to achieve final victory.
    At a time when comprehensive and thorough disarmament has become an agenda item of the United Nations, and the whole world is moving towards peaceful coexistence after the Khrushchev-Eisenhower talks, revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," that is, concluding a new Japan-U.S. military treaty, is fundamentally contrary to world peace and is a path towards war. The Kishi Nobusuke government has already formulated a new fiscal year budget centered on a large increase in military spending. At the same time, the Kishi Nobusuke government is attempting to complete the militarization of Japan in all aspects, including politics, economy, and education, by concluding a new Japan-U.S. military treaty, which not only seriously threatens the lives and rights of the working class and the broad masses of the people, but will also further deepen its dependence on the United States, follow the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression in Asia, and pose a major threat to the people of China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries.
    We know that the new Japan-U.S. military treaty will further promote the intensification of the so-called industrial "rationalization" policy by monopoly capital, creating a large number of unemployed and undermining the lives of Japanese workers. We are also convinced that peaceful coexistence and economic exchanges with China and the Soviet Union will promote the development of Japan's peaceful economy and improve the living standards of workers.
    We, the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people, must not forget our responsibility to the Asian countries that have suffered from Japanese aggression, especially the Chinese people. In order for Japan to truly become a peaceful country, it must first atone to the Chinese people. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government not only does not adopt a friendly policy towards the Chinese people, but instead adopts a hostile policy, and now further forms an aggressive military alliance with the United States, with China as the enemy, thus committing a double crime against the Chinese people. To stop this despicable and shameless behavior of the Kishi Nobusuke government and to establish friendly relations with the Chinese people is the minimum responsibility that we, the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people, should fulfill.
    The new Japan-U.S. military treaty fundamentally violates the interests of the Japanese nation and the wishes of the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people. The struggle of the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people to prevent the signing of the new Japan-U.S. military treaty and to smash the Japan-U.S. "security system" is advancing under the encouragement of the people of China and other countries around the world in their struggle to defend peace. In particular, the Chinese working class and the broad masses of the people have consistently and continuously supported us. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for this. While expressing our gratitude, we are determined to further strengthen our solidarity with the Chinese people in the future in order to win the final victory of the struggle.

### 日本人民决心加强同中国人民的团结

    日本人民决心加强同中国人民的团结
    日本工会总评议会议长　太田薰
    在日本工人阶级和广大人民的暴风雨般的抗议和反对下，岸信介一行人就像偷食的猫儿一样狼狈地溜出了日本。他们在华盛顿签署了新的日美“安全条约”。现在，日本工人阶级和广大人民反对这一条约的斗争，已经进入了一个极其紧迫的重大的新阶段。不过，通过到目前为止的斗争，我们已经加强了胜利的信心。日本工人阶级和广大人民，为了取得最后的胜利，正在最大限度地加强斗争。
    正当全面彻底裁军成为联合国的议题，而且经过赫鲁晓夫—艾森豪威尔会谈后全世界正朝着和平共处方向迈进的时候，修改日美“安全条约”，即缔结新的日美军事条约，是同世界和平根本背道而驰，是在走向战争的道路。岸信介政府已经以大量增加军费开支为中心编制成新年度的预算案。与此同时，岸信介政府正企图通过缔结新的日美军事条约，从政治、经济和教育等各方面来完成日本的军国主义化，不仅严重地威胁工人阶级和广大人民的生活和权利，而且将进一步地加深对美国的从属关系，追随美帝国主义侵略亚洲的政策，对中苏和亚洲各国人民造成重大的威胁。
    我们知道，新的日美军事条约将进一步促使垄断资本加紧实行所谓产业“合理化”政策，造成大批的失业者，破坏日本工人的生活。我们并且确信同中苏和平相处和开展经济交流，定会促进日本和平经济的发展，提高工人的生活水平。
    我们日本的工人阶级和广大人民，决不能忘记我们对于曾经遭受日本侵略的亚洲各国，尤其是中国人民所负的责任。为了使日本真正能够成为和平的国家，首先就必须向中国人民赎罪。但是，岸信介政府不仅不对中国人民采取友好政策，反而采取敌视政策，目前更进一步同美国结成以中国为敌的侵略的军事同盟，因而对中国人民犯下了双重的罪行。制止岸信介政府这种卑鄙无耻的行为、同中国人民建立友好关系，乃是我们日本工人阶级和广大人民应该尽到的最起码的责任。
    新的日美军事条约根本违反日本民族的利益和日本工人阶级与广大人民的愿望。日本工人阶级和广大人民为阻止签定新日美军事条约和粉碎日美“安全保障体制”所进行的斗争，是在以中国及世界各国人民保卫和平斗争的鼓舞下不断前进的。尤其是中国工人阶级和广大人民一贯不间断地在支援着我们。对此谨表示衷心的谢意。在感谢的同时，我们决心今后进一步加强同中国人民的团结，以争取斗争的最后胜利。
