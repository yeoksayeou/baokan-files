Common Knowledge

    Relief Printing
    Includes letterpress, zinc plates, rubber plates, and woodcut plates. This type of printing method involves making the text and images into relief plates, so that the blank areas do not receive ink during printing. Ordinary books and periodicals are printed using this method.

    Planographic Printing
    This type of printing includes lithography, offset printing, and collotype. In planographic printing, the printing plate has no height differences. Instead, chemical methods are used to treat the text or images on the printing plate, turning it into a lipophilic and water-repellent surface, while the blank areas become oleophobic and hydrophilic. During printing, a dampening system on the machine keeps the blank areas of the printing plate moist, so the ink can only adhere to the text and images to be printed. This printing method is generally used for printing musical scores, illustrations, maps, and color artwork.

    Intaglio Printing
    This method is most often used in printing stamps, banknotes, and pictorial magazines. This type of printing is divided into two types: engraved plates and gravure plates. First, recessed text and images are created on a metal printing plate. During printing, ink is applied to the plate surface, and the ink on the raised blank areas is wiped off. When printing, the moisture in the paper will absorb the ink from the recessed areas, so the printed text and images are very thick and three-dimensional.

    小常识
    凸版印刷
    包括铅版、锌版、橡胶版、木刻版。这一类印刷方法是把文字和图像制成凸版，使空白部分在印刷时不着油墨。普通书籍、报刊，都是用这种方法印刷。
    平版印刷
    这种印刷包括石印、胶印、珂?版。平版印刷的印版上没有高低的差别，只是采取化学方法把印版上的文字或图像加以处理，使它变成亲油抗水的表面，空白部分则变成抗油亲水。印刷时依靠机器上的湿润装置，使印版上的空白部分保持一定的水分，油墨就只能附在文字图像上印出来。这种印刷方法一般用于印制乐谱、插图、地图和彩色艺术品等。
    凹版印刷
    这种方法最多用在印刷邮票、钞票、画报等方面。这种印刷共分雕刻版和影写版两种，先在金属印版上制成凹纹的文字图像。印刷时，在版面上涂上油墨，并将凸出的空白部分上的油墨拭去。印的时候，纸张上的水分就会把凹下部分的油墨吸过去，所以印出来的文字图像很厚，呈立体状。
