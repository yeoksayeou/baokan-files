Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th (TASS): The following is the full text of the appeal from the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the parliaments and governments of all countries in the world:

    The Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has decided to issue an appeal to the parliaments and governments of all countries in the world on an extremely important issue concerning the interests of all mankind.

    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has decided to once again substantially reduce the number of Soviet armed forces without waiting for an agreement on disarmament to be reached internationally. We have passed a law on further reducing the Soviet armed forces by one-third, or 1.2 million people. The armament of the army and navy will be reduced, and military expenditures will be cut.

    When the law we passed today is implemented, our army and navy will still have 2,423,000 people.

    We would like to remind you that when discussing the issue of disarmament in 1956, the United States, Britain, and France stipulated in their proposals that the number of armed forces of the Soviet Union and the United States should each be 2.5 million. The Soviet government accepted their proposal, of course, based on the premise that this was only the first step in disarmament. However, as soon as the Soviet Union accepted this number, those who proposed it themselves rejected it.

    Three years have passed since then. No agreement has been reached with Western countries. This raises the question: what to do in the future? Our government, which has previously unilaterally reduced its armed forces and military spending several times, has decided to take new, bold, and lofty steps: to substantially reduce its armed forces again without delay.

    The Soviet Supreme Soviet passed the "Law on Further Substantial Reduction of Soviet Armed Forces" based on a realistic assessment of the current international situation. In fact, international tensions have greatly eased. The prospects for strengthening peace have greatly improved. In the consciousness of the people of all countries, and in the minds of political activists and state activists, such an undeniable truth is increasingly strengthened, that is, the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems is a historical fact and an urgent need arising from the current stage of human social development.

    Meetings and contacts between leaders of various countries are increasingly becoming an effective way to ease tensions and solve the most complex international issues. The visit of Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev to the United States and his talks with President Eisenhower opened a new page in international relations—conducting peaceful negotiations to solve the unresolved international problems left over from World War II and arising from the arms race and the "Cold War" era.

    The only feasible way to resolve a series of contentious issues is through negotiations. This is one of the main conclusions recognized and stated in the Soviet-American Joint Communiqué of September 27, 1959. A frank atmosphere, open and honest explanation of one's own position, and constructive consideration of mutual interests—all these characteristics manifested in the talks between the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the President of the United States are examples that must be followed if there is a sincere desire to fundamentally normalize the international situation.

    The Soviet Supreme Soviet expresses the hope that this constructive attitude will also be manifested at the upcoming summit conference of government leaders, where agreements will finally be reached. The people of all countries expect that this highest-level meeting can achieve new positive progress in international relations and will help solve the issue of disarmament.

    In its "Appeal to the Parliaments of All Countries" on October 31, 1959, the Soviet Supreme Soviet called on the parliaments and parliamentarians of all countries to take advantage of the current favorable international situation to do everything possible to free the people of all countries from the terrible disaster—the arms race—and to open up the path to lasting peace for all mankind.

    When we passed the "Law on Further Substantial Reduction of Soviet Armed Forces," we expressed the hope that the parliaments and governments of other countries could also embark on the same path. Now is the time to move from talking about disarmament to actually implementing it! Only in this way can we practically achieve the great task that representatives of all countries unanimously agreed to resolve at the recently concluded United Nations General Assembly; and the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, on behalf of the Soviet government, proposed a plan for complete and thorough disarmament at this conference.

    In human history, the arms race and war frenzy have never been as dangerous as they are today. Armies equipped with the most terrible tools for destroying humanity are confronting each other. Under such circumstances, the unwise actions or malice of individual national leaders could plunge the world into the abyss of war.

    The destructive power and range of modern weapons are limitless. Just detonating one hydrogen bomb could completely destroy the largest center of world civilization. Just a few hydrogen bombs could destroy an entire country. And the atomic and hydrogen bombs stored in warehouses are increasing.

    Due to the continued arms race, many people are detached from peaceful labor to serve in the military or produce destructive tools. The flowers of human society—millions of workers, engineers, scientists, hard-working and intelligent people—whose creative talents and energy could have done so much for the well-being of the people of all countries, are now expending their strength on manufacturing increasingly terrifying weapons of death.

    The more funds are used for the arms race, the more cannons, tanks, rockets, and other types of weapons are produced, the heavier the tax burden on the people becomes. Stopping the arms race would make it possible to use a large amount of additional funds for housing construction, for the needs of health and education, for increasing the income of working people, and for assisting economically underdeveloped countries.

    Realizing the great plan of complete and thorough disarmament proposed by the Soviet Union would free up enormous material and spiritual forces to create the life that people should live.

    In the last four years alone, the Soviet Union has unilaterally reduced its armed forces by a total of 2.14 million people, and now we are going to reduce them by another 1.2 million. Over the years, the Soviet Union has completely withdrawn its troops from the Romanian People's Republic and has greatly reduced its armed forces stationed in the German Democratic Republic and the Hungarian People's Republic, and has dismantled military bases it had set up on the territories of other countries.

    The Soviet Union has been continuously and annually reducing military expenditures in the national budget. The proportion of these appropriations accounted for only 12.9% of the total expenditures of the national budget in 1960, while it accounted for 19.9% in 1955.

    We are deeply convinced that the "Law on Further Substantial Reduction of Soviet Armed Forces" passed by the Soviet Supreme Soviet will make a significant contribution to the cause of further improving the international situation.

    Today, as countries are about to hold negotiations to discuss the issue of complete and thorough disarmament, the practical actions of countries taking unilateral disarmament measures have particularly significant meaning, because this helps create an atmosphere of trust and will promote the success of such negotiations. Although international tensions have eased, there are still forces in the world that are stirring, attempting to obstruct the elimination of the "Cold War" and the arms race that the people of all countries deeply resent. Therefore, such measures are especially necessary. West Germany is rearming and is being equipped with atomic weapons and rocket weapons, which has serious consequences for Europe and the cause of world peace. Some people in some countries are still openly clamoring for the implementation of the long-bankrupt "position of strength" policy.

    All this requires that all those who sincerely hope that the people of all countries can avoid a new war disaster cannot relax their efforts to reach a disarmament agreement. The parliaments and parliamentarians of various countries can do a lot of work in this regard. It is their responsibility and obligation to the people of all countries to use all possible means to promote the cessation of the arms race and the resolution of the disarmament issue.

    The Soviet Supreme Soviet hopes that the Soviet Union's further unilateral reduction of armed forces will become an example for other countries, especially those with great military strength, to follow.

    The Soviet Supreme Soviet calls on the parliaments and governments of all countries in the world to respond to the Soviet Union's new peace initiative and take practical steps to reduce existing armed forces, free the people of their own countries from the burden of armaments, free mankind from the threat of war, and guarantee peace throughout the world.

    苏联最高苏维埃会议致函各国议会和政府
    呼吁共同裁军保障世界和平
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书，全文如下：
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃决定就关系到全人类利益的一个极为重要的问题向世界各国议会和政府发出呼吁。
    苏联最高苏维埃决定，不等到裁军问题在国际范围内达成协议，再次大量裁减苏联武装部队的人数。我们通过了一项关于把苏联武装部队再裁减三分之一、即一百二十万人的法律。将裁减陆军和海军的军备，并削减军事开支。
    当我们今天通过的这项法律付诸实施的时候，我国的陆海军还有二百四十二万三千人。
    我们想提醒你们，在1956年讨论裁军问题时，美国、英国和法国在它们的建议中规定苏联和美国武装部队的数额各为二百五十万人。苏联政府接受了它们的建议，当然，它的出发点是，这仅仅是裁军的第一步。但是，苏联刚一接受这个数字，那些提出这个数字的人自己却拒绝了这个数字。
    从那时起，三年的时间已经过去了。一直没有能同西方国家达成协议。这就产生了一个问题：今后怎么办？在这以前就曾几次单方面裁减武装部队和军费的我国政府，决定采取新的大胆的和崇高的步骤：毫不拖延地再次大量裁减自己的武装部队。
    苏联最高苏维埃通过“再次大量裁减苏联武装部队的法律”时，是从对当前国际局势的现实估计出发的，实际上，国际紧张关系已经大大缓和了。加强和平的前景大大改善了。在各国人民的意识中，在政治活动家和国家活动家的思想中，这样一个确定不移的真理越来越加强了，即不同社会制度国家的和平共处是一个历史事实，是产生于人类社会发展现阶段的迫切需要。
    各国领导人之间的会晤和接触，日益成为缓和紧张局势和解决最复杂的国际问题的有效方法。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的访美和同艾森豪威尔总统的会谈，在国际关系中揭开了新的一页——进行和平谈判来解决第二次世界大战遗留下来的和在军备竞赛及“冷战”年代中产生的悬而未决的国际问题。
    解决一系列争执问题的唯一可行的道路就是谈判的道路，这是1959年9月27日苏美联合公报所承认并载明的主要结论之一。坦率的气氛、开诚布公地阐述自己的态度和建设性地考虑相互利益，所有这些在苏联部长会议主席和美国总统会谈中表现的特点，是必须效法的榜样，如果真诚希望国际局势根本正常化的话。
    苏联最高苏维埃表示希望，这种建设性的态度在现在终于达成协议而就要召开的各国政府首脑会议上也得到表现。各国人民期待，这次最高级会晤能在国际关系方面获得新的积极的进展，并将有助于解决裁军问题。
    苏联最高苏维埃在1959年10月31日的“致世界各国议会呼吁书”中曾呼吁各国议会和议员利用目前已经形成的有利的国际形势，尽一切可能使各国人民摆脱可怕的灾难——军备竞赛，并且为全人类开辟持久和平的道路。
    当我们通过“关于再次大量裁减苏联武装部队的法律”时，我们表示希望，其他国家的议会和政府也能走上同一方向的道路。现在是从谈论裁军过渡到实际实现裁军的时候了！只有在这种情况下，才能实际实现世界各国的代表在不久前闭幕的联合国大会上一致赞成解决的这个伟大任务；而苏联部长会议主席在这次大会上代表苏联政府提出了全面彻底裁军的计划。
    在人类历史上，军备竞赛和战争狂热从来没有像今天那样危险。装备着最可怕的毁灭人类的工具的军队彼此对峙着。在这种情况下，个别国家领导人不明智的行动或者恶意，都可能使世界陷入战争浩劫的深渊。
    现代化武器的破坏力和射程是无限的，只要爆炸一个氢弹就可能彻底毁灭世界文明的最大中心。只要几个氢弹就能毁灭整个国家。而在仓库里储存的原子弹和氢弹却越来越多。
    由于继续进行军备竞赛，许多人脱离了和平劳动，去服兵役或者生产毁灭性的工具。人类社会的花朵——千百万工人、工程师、科学家、勤劳智慧的人们，他们的创造天才和精力本来能为各国人民的幸福做许多事情，但现在却把自己的力量耗费在制造越来越可怕的死亡武器上面。
    用于军备竞赛的资金越多，生产大炮、坦克、火箭和其他种类的武器越多，人民的赋税负担也就越重。停止军备竞赛，就有可能把大量的额外资金用于住宅建筑，用于卫生和教育的需要，用于提高劳动人民的收入，用于援助经济上不发达的国家。
    实现苏联提出的全面彻底裁军的伟大计划，就能把巨大的物质力量和精神力量用来创造人所应过的生活。
    仅仅在最近四年内，苏联就单方面裁减了武装部队总共二百一十四万人，而现在我们再要裁减一百二十万人。这些年来，苏联从罗马尼亚人民共和国完全撤出了自己的军队，并且大大减少了自己驻扎在德意志民主共和国和匈牙利人民共和国境内的武装部队，撤销了自己在其他国家领土上设置的军事基地。
    苏联不断地、逐年地削减国家预算中的军费。这些拨款的比重，在1960年只占国家预算全部开支的12．9％，而在1955年则占19．9％。
    我们深信，苏联最高苏维埃通过的“关于再次大量裁减苏联武装部队的法律”将对进一步改善国际局势的事业作出重大贡献。
    在各国即将举行谈判以讨论全面彻底裁军问题的今天，各国采取单方面裁军措施的实际行动具有特别重大的意义，因为这有助于创造信任气氛，会促进这种谈判的成功。虽然国际紧张局势有了缓和，但是世界上还有一种势力在蠢动，他们企图阻挠消除各国人民所深恶痛绝的“冷战”和军备竞赛，因此，这种措施就尤其必要了。西德正在重新武装，正在装备原子武器和火箭武器，这对于欧洲以及世界和平事业孕育着严重的后果。一些国家中有人仍然在公开叫嚣奉行早已破产了的“实力地位”政策。
    这一切要求所有真诚希望各国人民避免新战争灾难的人不能放松争取达成裁军协议的努力。各国的议会和议员在这方面可以做许多工作。它（他）们对各国人民的职责和义务是，利用一切可能来促进停止军备竞赛，促进解决裁军问题。
    苏联最高苏维埃希望，苏联的再次单方面裁减武装部队将成为其他国家，特别是那些拥有极大军事实力的国家效法的榜样。
    苏联最高苏维埃呼吁世界各国议会和政府响应苏联的新的和平倡议，并采取实际的步骤来裁减现有的武装部队，使自己国家的人民摆脱军备负担，使人类免除战争威胁，保障全世界和平。
