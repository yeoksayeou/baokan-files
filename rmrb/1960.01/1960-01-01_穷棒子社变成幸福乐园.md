    Poor Stick Cooperative Becomes a Paradise of Happiness
    Wang Guofan, Head of Jianming People's Commune, Zunhua, Hebei

    The brilliant year of 1959 has passed, and the new year of 1960 follows closely behind. My heart is blooming as I welcome this new year. How could I not be happy on this wonderful day!

    Over the past year, the members of our commune, like the people of the whole country, have been in high spirits and full of energy. More than eight thousand water conservancy workers fought in the deep mountains and on steep cliffs, not wearing cotton clothes in the dead of winter, chiseling mountain springs barefoot in the water, shouting and roaring with great enthusiasm! The progress of the "Three Springs Combined into One" project, which circles two large mountain ridges, the forty-two-li-long Pan-Shan main canal, and the pumping stations on the mountain, is as fast as flying! The commune members who are erecting high-voltage power lines, building fertilizer plants and machinery repair plants, and building roads are not lagging behind either, challenging and competing with the water conservancy army to ensure the completion of the main projects of agricultural modernization before the Spring Festival. Agricultural production is also booming. 60% of the wheat has reached the "Three Popularizations" (topdressing, rolling, and watering), and the task of accumulating 600 million jin of fertilizer in winter and spring has been completed by 400 million jin, averaging more than 8,000 jin per mu; a 10,000-pig farm built in the high-yield plot has already prepared 150 pens.

    Why are the commune members so energetic? In a word, the Party's General Line has illuminated our hearts. 1959 was different from previous years, it was a year of continued leap forward. The great superiority of communization has been specifically demonstrated in this year. In the winter of 1958, there was very little snow, and in the spring of 1959, we encountered a severe drought. Until June, only 95 millimeters of rain fell. In July, we encountered the largest flood since liberation, with 390 millimeters of rain falling in one day and night. In terms of manpower, we were not very sufficient. Nearly half of the strongest male labor force in the whole commune went to Miyun to build reservoirs. In addition, another 100 young and middle-aged people were transferred to Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and other places to engage in industrial construction. However, due to the establishment of the People's Commune, we had the strength to resist disasters. After communization, in addition to actively running public canteens, nurseries, and other collective welfare undertakings, providing a large amount of labor for production, we also purchased four tractors, eleven agricultural machines such as deep plows, seeders, and harvesters, and sixteen power machines such as portable steam engines, gas generators, and diesel engines. The investment of these things into production not only solved the shortage of labor and completed the production tasks on time, but also reduced the labor intensity of the commune members. The drought demon in spring could not scare us, and the extraordinary floods in summer could not scare us either! This year, the total income of the whole commune was 3.35 million yuan, an increase of 29.6% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and the average income per person was 112.8 yuan; an increase of 16.3% compared with 1958.

    We know that all of this was done under the leadership of the Party. We wholeheartedly and forever want to follow the Party. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party further encouraged us. After the autumn harvest, we dispatched more than 1,700 people to build the large canal of the Jieguanting Reservoir, diverting the spring water of Baimayu over the mountain ridge. According to the urgent demands of the vast number of commune members, the commune Party committee put forward the fighting goal for 1960: "Work hard for a hundred days to realize agricultural modernization, work hard for a year to double production, hold high the red flag of the General Line, and be determined to make great changes in the mountainous area."

    Working hard for a hundred days to realize agricultural modernization means trying every possible means to overcome all difficulties; to achieve irrigation of 90% of the commune's more than 49,000 mu of arable land, which is characterized by "more mountains, less flat land, more sand and thin soil," to ensure a good harvest despite drought or flood; to increase agricultural machinery, so that 70% of the major agricultural operations in the cultivated land can be mechanized; according to the principle of both increasing the application of coarse fertilizer and quick-acting chemical fertilizer, vigorously developing animal husbandry and the production of chemical fertilizers, to achieve the application of 12,000 jin of coarse fertilizer and 30 to 50 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu, and gradually solve the production of chemical drugs needed for plant protection; at the same time, to achieve electrification, so that water conservancy machinery, fertilizer plants and industrial development can use electricity, and conditions are available to develop civil lighting.

    The rapid realization of this grand plan marks a new historical stage in the technological revolution of agricultural production. By then, our "Poor Stick Cooperative" at the foot of the Great Wall will become a beautiful and prosperous paradise of happiness!

    穷棒子社变成幸福乐园
    河北遵化建明人民公社社长　王国藩
    灿烂的1959年过去了，新的1960年接踵而来。我心花怒放地迎接这新的一年。在这大好的日子里，我咋能不乐呢！
    一年来，我们公社的社员和全国人民一样，斗志昂扬，干劲冲天。八千多名水利大军战斗在深山里、陡壁上，十冬腊月不穿棉衣裳，光着脚在水里凿山泉，?呼喝叫地可热闹啦！绕两个大山梁的“三泉合一”、四十二华里长的盘山大干渠，山上的扬水机站等等工程的进度，比飞还快呢！架高压电线，建化肥厂和机械修配厂以及修公路的社员们，也不落后，跟水利大军挑战竞赛，保证春节前完成农业现代化的主要工程。农业生产也搞得热火。60％的麦子已达到三普（追肥、轧、浇水），冬春积肥六亿斤的任务已完成了四亿斤，每亩合八千多斤；丰产方里建的一个万猪场，已打好一百五十个圈。
    社员们的干劲这么足，原因是什么？一句话，是党的总路线照亮了我们的心。1959年不比往年，它是继续跃进年。公社化后的巨大优越性，在这一年中具体显示出来了。1958年冬天雪很少，1959年春天又遇上了大旱，直到6月，一共才下九十五毫米的雨，到7月又遇上了解放以来没有过的最大洪水，一昼夜就下了三百九十毫米的雨；就人力来说，我们并不太充足，全社最精壮的男劳力有将近一半到密云修水库，另外，还有一百名青壮年被调往北京、天津、唐山等地从事工业建设；但由于成立了人民公社，我们却有力量抗住灾害。公社化后，我们除积极举办公共食堂、托儿所等集体福利事业，给生产上提供大量劳力外，还购置了拖拉机四台，深耕机、播种机、收割机等农业机械十一台，锅驼机、煤气机、柴油机等动力机械十六台。这些东西一投入生产，不但解决了劳力的不足，按时完成了生产任务，还减轻了社员的劳动强度。春天的旱魔吓不倒我们，夏天的特大洪水也吓不倒我们！这一年，全社总收入三百三十五万元，比大跃进的1958年增长29．6％，每人平均收入一百一十二元八角；比1958年增加16．3％。
    我们知道，这些都是党领导着我们干的。我们一心一意永远要跟着党走。党的八届八中全会更鼓舞了我们。秋后，我们出动了一千七百多人修接官厅水库的大干渠，引白马峪的泉水过山梁。公社党委根据广大社员的迫切要求，提出了1960年的奋斗目标是：“大干百天，实现农业现代化，苦战一年，生产加番，高举总路线的红旗，决心使山区面貌大改变。”
    大干百天，实现农业现代化，就是想尽一切办法，克服一切困难；使全社的“山地多、平地少、沙多土薄”的四万九千多亩耕地，90％实现水利化，达到旱涝保丰收；增添农业机械，使70％的耕地各项主要农活的操作达到机械化；根据增施粗肥和速效化肥并举的方针，大搞畜牧业和化学肥料的生产，达到亩施粗肥一万二千斤、化肥三十到五十斤，逐步解决植物保护所需要的化学药物的生产；同时，还要来个电气化，使水利机械、化肥厂和发展工业等用上电，有条件的发展民用照明。
    这个宏伟计划的迅速实现，标志着农业生产的技术革命进入了一个新的历史阶段。到那时，我们这个长城脚下的“穷棒子社”就要变成一个美丽而富饶的幸福乐园！
