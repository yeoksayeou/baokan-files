    High Song, This Spring is Red Again
    Chang Lunbin, Pingxiang Iron and Steel Plant, Jiangxi
    The steelworker's strength is boundless, pulling out steel commanders to shake mountains and rivers;
    Last night, steel bars were laid down, and this morning, the molten iron flowers are red again!
    Iron flowers bloom with smiles, filling the garden and standing tall, suppressing the west wind.
    Beating drums, riding dragons, leaping into the sky,
    Singing loudly, this spring is red again!

    高歌今年春又红
    江西萍乡钢铁厂　昌伦斌钢铁工人力无穷，撁出钢帅山河动；昨夜扎下钢筋骨，今朝又是铁花红！铁花朵朵露笑容，满园矗立压西风。擂鼓骑龙凌空跃，高歌今年春又红！
