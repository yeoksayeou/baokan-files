(Reported by our newspaper) The staff of the Calcium-Magnesium Phosphate Fertilizer Workshop of the Kunming Fertilizer Plant in Yunnan actively studied technology, improved operations, and boldly proposed pre-calcining dolomite in a lime kiln before using it in the production of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer. The results of experiments in a blast furnace showed that the output using calcined dolomite as a raw material increased by about 25% compared to using raw dolomite; the effective phosphorus content of the finished product increased from the original 13%-14% to 15%-15.5%, and the coke consumption quota was reduced by 22.8%.

The chemical composition of dolomite is mainly calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate, which begin to decompose into calcium oxide and magnesium oxide at around 500 degrees Celsius, releasing a large amount of carbon dioxide gas. The entire process is endothermic. When unfired dolomite is used in the formula for production, the decomposition process of dolomite takes place in the furnace, thus consuming more coke, raising the temperature in the furnace, increasing the corrosion of the furnace, and affecting the life of the blast furnace. Therefore, pre-calcining the dolomite, so that the decomposition process takes place outside the furnace, can overcome the above shortcomings.

The calcination of dolomite is carried out in a soil kiln for burning lime. Coal blocks made of pulverized coal are used as fuel, and the calcination method is the same as the method for burning lime. The size of the soil kiln is determined according to the needs of the blast furnace. The calcined dolomite must not come into contact with water and should not be stored for too long.

The raw materials used by the plant are Kunyang phosphate rock (containing 33.5% phosphorus pentoxide), dolomite, silica, and coke. When using pre-calcined dolomite as a raw material for production, the melting point of the materials is lowered, and the melting speed is accelerated, thus shortening the residence time of the materials in the furnace, reducing phosphorus loss, and greatly improving the output and quality of the finished product.

Due to the short experimental time, the effect of using pre-calcined dolomite on the corrosion of the furnace and the life of the blast furnace has not yet been determined and needs to be further tested. However, it can be predicted that after the dolomite is pre-calcined, the melting temperature of the materials will be reduced, the temperature inside the blast furnace will be lowered, which will weaken the corrosion of the molten material on the furnace to a certain extent, and prolong the life of the blast furnace.

### 昆明化肥厂改进操作方法  预先锻烧白云石　钙镁磷肥产量高

    昆明化肥厂改进操作方法
    预先锻烧白云石　钙镁磷肥产量高
    本报讯　云南昆明化肥厂钙镁磷肥车间职工，积极钻研技术，改进操作，大胆提出了把白云石预先在石灰窑内锻烧，再进行配料生产钙镁磷肥的建议。在高炉内进行试验结果：采用锻烧白云石配料比生白云石配料的产量增长25％左右；成品的有效磷由原来的13％—14％提高到15％—15．5％，焦炭的消耗定额降低了22．8％。
    白云石的化学组成主要是碳酸钙、碳酸镁，在摄氏五百度左右便开始分解为氧化钙、氧化镁，并放出大量的二氧化碳气，整个过程是吸热的。当采用未锻烧的白云石配方进行生产时，白云石的分解过程是在炉内进行，因而多消耗焦炭，并使炉内温度升高，增加炉子的腐蚀，影响高炉寿命。因此，白云石加以预先锻烧，使分解过程在炉外进行，就能克服上述缺点。
    白云石的锻烧是在烧石灰的土窑中进行的。燃料用粉煤做成的煤块，其锻烧的方法与烧石灰的方法相同。土窑的大小根据高炉的需要量而定。锻烧后的白云石不能遇水，也不能贮存过长。
    该厂所用的原料是昆阳磷矿石（含五氧化二磷33．5％）、白云石、硅石、焦炭四种。采用预先锻烧的白云石配料生产时，物料熔点降低，熔化速度加快，因此缩短了物料在炉内的停留时间，减少了磷损失，使高炉产量及成品质量大大提高。
    由于试验时间短，采用预先锻烧白云石配料，对炉子的腐蚀及对高炉寿命的影响还未摸清，有待继续试验。但是可以预测，白云石经过预先锻烧，物料的熔融温度降低，高炉内温度会降低，在一定程度上将会减弱熔料对炉子的腐蚀，使高炉寿命得到延长。（附图片）
