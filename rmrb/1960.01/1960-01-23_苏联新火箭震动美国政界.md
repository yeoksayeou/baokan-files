Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 22nd: The powerful rocket launched by the Soviet Union into the Pacific region has shaken political circles in Washington. Democratic Senator Lyndon Johnson exclaimed that the Soviet Union's super rocket has put the United States within range of "a devastating attack by the enemy in an instant," saying it has become the most serious danger facing the United States.

Johnson revealed the helpless sorrow of the United States after losing its "position of strength." He said: "The Soviet Union can talk about peace today because it is not worried about being forced to accept peace on American terms. The Soviet Union can pick the day on the calendar today because its leaders correctly believe that time is not on the side of the United States."

The U.S. State Department remained tight-lipped about the Soviet rocket launch. State Department spokesman White refused to comment. Senior military officials, on the other hand, tried to minimize the great significance of the Soviet Union's new achievement. Defense Secretary Gates admitted that the accuracy of the Soviet Union's rocket was "very good."

CIA Director Allen Dulles discussed the Soviet rocket launch and the general situation of the Soviet Union's efforts in space with the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. After the meeting, Committee Chairman Overton Brooks said that Dulles's assessment was "discouraging."

Under Secretary of State Merchant also admitted when testifying before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics on the 20th that "the Soviet Union's achievements in space are remarkable, and they undeniably diminish the luster of American achievements. It is dangerous to ignore the role of the Soviet Union's claims based on its achievements."

    苏联新火箭震动美国政界
    据新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：苏联向太平洋地区发射的强大火箭震动了华盛顿政界，民主党参议员林登·约翰逊惊呼苏联的超级火箭使美国处于遭受“敌人瞬息之间的、蹂躏性的袭击”的距离内，说它成为美国所面临的最严重的危险。
    约翰逊透露了美国在失去“实力地位”后的无可奈何的悲哀。他说：“苏联今天能够谈论和平，是因为它不担心会有被迫在美国的条件下接受的和平。苏联今天能够在日程上挑选日子，因为它的领袖们正确地相信，时间并不在美国的一边。”
    美国国务院对苏联发射火箭的消息噤若寒蝉，国务院发言人怀特拒绝发表评论。而军方高级官员则竭力缩小苏联新成就的巨大意义。国防部长盖茨承认，苏联所说的火箭的准确性是“非常好的”。
    中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯同众议院科学和星际航行委员会讨论了苏联发射火箭的事以及苏联在空间方面所作的努力的一般情况。委员会主席奥佛顿·布鲁克斯在这次会议后说，杜勒斯的估计是“令人泄气的”。
    副国务卿麦钱特20日在众议院科学和星际航行委员会作证时，也承认“苏联在空间方面的成就是引人注目的，它不可否认地使美国的成就失去光辉。忽视苏联根据它的成就提出的说法的作用是危险的。”
