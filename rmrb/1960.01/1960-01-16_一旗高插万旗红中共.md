Since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, Hubei Province, like all parts of the country, has seen the emergence of thousands upon thousands of advanced producers among the workers. These advanced individuals have become good examples for the masses to learn from. Ma Xueli is the most outstanding representative of the advanced producers on the industrial and transportation fronts in our province, and a bright red banner among the workers. He possesses a loyal heart that loves the Party and loves socialism, a communist attitude towards labor, an innovative spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and a fine style of maintaining close ties with the masses. The masses praise him by saying: "Believe in the masses, believe in the Party, dare to innovate, take on difficulties, yield honors, learn from the advanced, and help the backward." Indeed, his thoughts and actions are in line with the requirements of the Party's General Line and the requirements of vigorously promoting technical innovation and the technical revolution. Therefore, at the provincial conference of advanced collectives and advanced producers in industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade in October 1959, as soon as the proposal to learn from Ma Xueli was put forward, a wave of comparison, learning, and catching up immediately emerged in industrial and transportation enterprises throughout the province. The Provincial Party Committee then made a decision to launch a movement to learn from Ma Xueli, calling on all workers in the province to "do as Ma Xueli does." The decision of the Provincial Party Committee was warmly supported by the broad masses, and the movement quickly reached a climax.

Although the movement to learn from Ma Xueli has not been carried out for a long time in our province, the effect has been very significant. Through this movement, the broad masses of workers have established a communist attitude towards labor, promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, strengthened the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and large-scale collaboration, and launched a competitive upsurge of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping, thereby promoting the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, powerfully guaranteeing the early and over-fulfillment of the 1959 national plan, and laying an ideological foundation for the new leap forward in 1960. In this movement, the broad masses of workers have actively made plans, expressed their determination, and learned from Ma Xueli. The advanced are modest and prudent, striving to be even more advanced, and connecting with the masses to help the backward and move forward together. The backward are not willing to lag behind, comparing themselves with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. Those who have always been conservative, afraid of difficulties, and content with the status quo have not only examined their shortcomings and mistakes, but also mustered their energy, liberated their minds, and taken the initiative to engage in innovation. Truly, holding high one banner, ten thousand banners follow; one horse takes the lead, ten thousand horses gallop.

The basic reasons why the movement to learn from Ma Xueli can be carried out so quickly and with such good results are: First, the movement to learn from Ma Xueli is a profound ideological movement. It is carried out on the basis of socialist and General Line education, and is a continuation and deepening of socialist and General Line education. It requires all workers to establish and consolidate the proletarian world outlook, criticize and eliminate the bourgeois world outlook, and establish and consolidate the communist attitude towards labor, and criticize and overcome the individualistic attitude towards labor. Hu Yulin, a young worker at the Jiang'an Rolling Stock Plant in Wuhan, is a typical example of a person who has transformed from backward to advanced in the education of the General Line and the movement to learn from Ma Xueli. Before his transformation, his ideological characteristics were: "Work for money, do more for more money, do less for less money, and don't work without money; man is for himself, heaven and earth will destroy him." Hu Yulin's thought is the thought of bourgeois individualism, which has a certain representative nature among some workers. Anyone who is tainted with this kind of thinking shows insufficient enthusiasm at work, sometimes hot and sometimes cold; in life, he shows a fascination with the bourgeois way of life and is greedy; in leading cadres, he shows personal ambition and reaches out to authority. If this kind of thinking is allowed to develop, it will lead to the capitalist road. This kind of thinking is precisely the opposite of Ma Xueli's thinking. The struggle between these two kinds of thinking is the struggle between two roads, two lines, and two world outlooks, and it is the struggle between the communist attitude towards labor and the individualistic attitude towards labor. In this movement, the workers of Jiang'an Rolling Stock Plant put forward the slogan of "Compare with Hu Yulin, deeply dig out ideological roots; learn from Ma Xueli, strive to be upstream people." After comparison and education, the communist style was promoted and developed, and bourgeois individualistic thought had nowhere to hide. Not only has Hu Yulin himself been transformed into an activist who loves labor and actively engages in innovation, but more importantly, all the workers have received a profound socialist and communist ideological education, greatly improving their consciousness in implementing the Party's General Line, and achieving a double harvest of ideology and production.

Second, the movement to learn from Ma Xueli is a huge driving force for vigorously promoting technical innovation and the technical revolution. It not only improved the ideological awareness of the workers, but also greatly promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. After studying Ma Xueli's style and examining Hu Yulin's thinking, the workers of Jiang'an Rolling Stock Plant developed a style of working hard and diligently, and working hard and cleverly. More than 3,000 people in the factory put forward more than 20,000 innovation proposals in less than ten days, more than thirty times the total number of proposals in the previous ten months, and a new atmosphere of "everyone is engaged in innovation, everything is creative, plans are exceeded every day, and good news is constantly reported" has emerged. Most industrial and transportation enterprises in the province have also received the same results. On the basis of comprehensively carrying out the movement to learn from Ma Xueli, the Provincial Party Committee promoted the experience of Daye Steel Plant in organizing key battle campaigns and vigorously promoting technical innovation, further guiding thousands upon thousands of Ma Xueli-style people and Ma Xueli-style groups to the main direction and main battlefield of technical innovation in a timely manner, so that this ideological movement and the mass movement of technical innovation are more closely combined, implementing large-scale joint operations, and continuously breaking through key production points. The movement to learn from Ma Xueli plus the key battle campaign is exactly "like a fish in water." The two have merged into a torrent, exerting an even greater force and enabling the mass movement of technical innovation to enter a new stage.

Third, the movement to learn from Ma Xueli is an extremely widespread movement of mass competition to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward. This movement is both suitable for the needs of the situation and in line with the requirements of the masses. Therefore, it has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the workers to "establish lofty ambitions, strive to be upstream people," and improved the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in the competition. In this movement, all enterprises and units have used the method of inserting red flags and widely establishing pacesetters, putting forward the vivid slogan of learning from Ma Xueli externally and learning from so-and-so internally (representative figures of advanced producers in the unit), forming a magnificent mass movement. Daye Steel Plant calls it a new situation of "advanced in batches, pacesetters in forests, innovations in series, and competition in networks."

We hold high this red banner of Ma Xueli precisely to promote the massive emergence of thousands upon thousands of Ma Xueli-style people and Ma Xueli-style groups. The situation is exactly like this now. We know that at any time there is a contradiction between the advanced and the backward, and the correct leadership method is to be good at making the advanced more advanced and the backward catch up with the advanced. This is the working method of "grasping both ends and bringing along the middle" taught by Chairman Mao. Organizing the movement to learn from Ma Xueli is a concrete study and application of this method. We will also continue to sum up experience from practice and continue to move forward.

    一旗高插万旗红中共
    湖北省委书记处书记　王树成
    1958年大跃进以来，在党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，湖北省和全国各地一样，在职工群众中，涌现出了成千上万个先进生产者。这些先进人物已经成为群众学习的好榜样。马学礼就是我省工业、交通战线上先进生产者中最优秀的代表，是职工群众中一面鲜艳的红旗。他具有热爱党、热爱社会主义的赤胆忠心，具有共产主义的劳动态度，具有敢想、敢说、敢做的革新精神，具有密切联系群众的优良作风。群众对他的称赞是：“相信群众相信党，大搞革新有胆量，见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮”。的确，他的思想行为，是符合于党的总路线的要求，符合于大闹技术革新和技术革命的要求的。所以，在1959年10月全省工业、交通、基本建设和财贸方面先进集体和先进生产者代表大会上，一经提出学习马学礼的倡议，全省工业交通企业便立即出现了比、学、赶的热潮。省委随即作出了开展学习马学礼运动的决定，号召全省职工“照马学礼那样干”。省委的决定，得到了广大群众的热烈拥护，运动迅速形成高潮。
    我省开展学习马学礼运动，时间虽然不长，效果却很显著。通过这一运动，广大的职工群众，树立了共产主义的劳动态度，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义的风格，加强了团结互助大协作的精神，掀起了比、学、赶、帮的竞赛热潮，从而促进了技术革新和技术革命运动的蓬勃发展，有力地保证了1959年国家计划的提前和超额完成，并且为1960年的新跃进打下了思想基础。在这一运动中，广大职工群众纷纷订规划、表决心，向马学礼学习。先进的戒骄戒躁，力争更加先进，并且联系群众，帮助落后，共同前进。落后的不甘落后，比先进，学先进，迎头赶先进。过去一贯保守、畏难苟安的人，现在不仅检查了自己的缺点错误，而且鼓足了干劲，解放了思想，主动地闹革新。真是一旗高插万旗红，一马当先万马奔。
    学习马学礼运动所以能够开展得如此之快，效果如此之好，基本的原因是：首先，学习马学礼运动是一次深刻的思想运动。它是在社会主义和总路线教育基础上开展起来的，又是社会主义和总路线教育的继续和深入。它要求所有职工树立和巩固无产阶级世界观，批判和肃清资产阶级世界观，树立和巩固共产主义劳动态度，批判和克服个人主义的劳动态度。武汉市江岸车辆厂青年工人胡玉林，就是在总路线教育和学习马学礼运动中，由落后转变为先进的一个典型人物。他在转变以前的思想特点是：“干活拿钱，钱多多干，钱少少干，无钱不干；人不为己，天诛地灭”。胡玉林思想就是资产阶级个人主义的思想，在一部分职工中，是有一定代表性的。凡是沾染了这种思想的人，在工作上，表现为干劲不足，时冷时热；在生活上，表现为迷恋资产阶级生活方式，贪得无厌；在领导干部身上，表现为个人野心，向权威伸手。如果任这种思想发展下去，就会走资本主义道路。这种思想恰恰是马学礼思想的反面。这两种思想的斗争，是两条道路、两条路线、两种世界观的斗争，是共产主义劳动态度和个人主义劳动态度的斗争。江岸车辆厂的职工群众，在这一运动中，提出了“对照胡玉林，深挖思想根；学习马学礼，争做上游人”的口号。经过对比教育，共产主义风格发扬光大，资产阶级个人主义思想无处藏身。不仅胡玉林本人已经转变成为热爱劳动、大闹革新的积极分子，而且更重要的是，全体职工都受到了一次深刻的社会主义和共产主义思想教育，大大地提高了执行党的总路线的自觉性，实现了思想、生产双丰收。
    其次，学习马学礼运动是大闹技术革新和技术革命的巨大动力。它不仅提高了职工群众的思想觉悟，而且大大发扬了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。江岸车辆厂的职工群众，在学习马学礼风格、检查胡玉林思想之后，干劲加钻劲、苦干加巧干成了风气。全厂三千多人，不到十天，提出了革新建议两万多条，为前十个月建议总数的三十多倍，出现了“人人闹革新，事事有创造，天天超计划，时时传捷报”的新气象。全省大多数工业、交通企业也收到了同样效果。在全面开展学习马学礼运动的基础上，省委推广了大冶钢厂组织攻关战役、大闹技术革新的经验，进一步把千千万万个马学礼式的人和马学礼式的小组，及时地引导到技术革新的主攻方向和主攻阵地上来，使这一思想运动和技术革新的群众运动更加紧密地结合起来，实行大兵团联合作战，连续不断地攻破了生产关键。学习马学礼运动加攻关战役，正是“如鱼得水”，二者已经汇成一股洪流，发挥出更加巨大的力量，使技术革新的群众运动跨进了新的阶段。
    再次，学习马学礼运动是一次极其广泛的比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮落后的群众竞赛运动。这个运动，既适合形势需要，又符合群众要求。因此，它大大地激发了职工群众“树雄心，立大志，争作上游人”的热情，提高了群众参加竞赛的积极性。在这一运动中，各企业单位都运用了大插红旗，广树标兵的方法，提出外学马学礼、内学某某人（本单位的先进生产者代表人物）的生动口号，形成了波澜壮阔的群众运动。大冶钢厂称之为“先进成批，标兵成林，革新连串，竞赛成网”的新局面。
    我们高插马学礼这一面红旗，正是为了促进千千万万个马学礼式的人和马学礼式的小组的大量涌现。现在的情形也正是这样。我们知道，在任何时候都存在着先进与落后的矛盾，正确的领导方法就是善于使先进的更加先进，落后的赶上先进。这就是毛主席教导我们的“抓两头，带中间”的工作方法。组织学习马学礼运动，是我们对这个方法的一次具体学习和运用。我们还将从实践中总结经验，继续前进。
