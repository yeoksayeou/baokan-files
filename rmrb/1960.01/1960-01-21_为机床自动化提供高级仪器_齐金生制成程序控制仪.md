    Providing advanced instruments for machine tool automation
    Qi Jinsheng Develops Program Control Instrument
    (Our report) Qi Jinsheng, a lathe operator at Harbin Boiler Factory, has successfully trial-produced a program control instrument that combines electrical and mechanical elements. By fitting this control instrument to a lathe, simply clamping the workpiece to be processed in the chuck, adjusting the longitudinal and transverse controls according to the blueprint requirements, and switching on the power, the lathe can automatically produce precision parts of various specifications. The program control instrument creates conditions for the automation of general-purpose machine tools.
    Program control of metal cutting machine tools involves pre-adjusting the working sequence, speed, and stroke that the machine tool's working mechanism should complete, so that the machine tool automatically completes the machining according to the specified work program. The use of machine tools equipped with program control instruments for production has eight major advantages: ① It can automatically process according to predetermined dimensions using the most reasonable cutting parameters, without the need for templates, trial runs, or in-process measurements. ② It reduces auxiliary time, alleviates workers' labor intensity, and frees workers from heavy manual operations. ③ It can achieve multi-machine management, thus solving the problem of labor shortages. ④ The quality of products is more stable than general machining, with radial errors below 0.08 mm. ⑤ It is suitable for machine tools performing single, small-batch production, and can automatically process different parts with simple readjustment. ⑥ For machining parts with particularly complex shapes, it can be quickly put into production without manufacturing copy molds, shortening the production preparation cycle. ⑦ It improves production efficiency while preserving the flexibility of general-purpose machine tools. ⑧ The retrofit work can be carried out by general mechanical manufacturing plants, and other machine tools can also achieve automation using the same principle, which can greatly reduce the cost compared to designing and manufacturing dedicated automated machine tools.
    The lathe program control instrument created by Qi Jinsheng does not require advanced electronic tubes and complex cam mechanisms. In addition to using a distribution box and gearbox, it only installs longitudinal and transverse control drums in the mechanical part, costing only about 300 yuan.
    Qi Jinsheng only had five years of schooling. Under the education and cultivation of the Party, his ideological consciousness and technical level have continuously improved, but he was not satisfied. With the help of technicians Liu Kuiying and Liu Deling, he spent more than two months of spare time, working hard to draw all the sketches. Qi Jinsheng failed thirteen times in the process of designing and manufacturing the lathe program control instrument, but he did not lose heart. He resolutely relied on the Party organization and the masses. In the trial production process, he received enthusiastic help from comrades Ge Wenlin, Shi Zengfu, Jin Xiaorun, Liao Zhenguang, Yang Zhirong, Tang Rukun, Xiong Zhaoqi, Zhang Shuqin, and others, and finally successfully trial-produced it.

    为机床自动化提供高级仪器
    齐金生制成程序控制仪
    本报讯　哈尔滨锅炉厂车工齐金生试制成功一台电气和机械相结合的程序控制仪。把这种控制仪装配在车床上，只要把要加工的工件卡在卡盘上，按图纸要求对好纵横控制，推上电门，车床就可以自动生产出各种规格的精密的部件。程序控制仪为通用机床实现自动化创造了条件。
    金属切削机床的程序控制，就是把机床的工作机构所应该完成的工作顺序、速度和行程，都事先调整好，机床就自动地按规定的工作程序完成机械加工。使用配有程序控制仪的机床进行生产有八大优点：①不用样板，不作试验行程，不用在加工过程中进行测量，就能够自动根据既定的尺寸，使用最合理的切削用量进行加工。②减少辅助时间，减轻工人劳动强度，使工人从繁重的手工操作中解放出来。③可以实现多机床管理，因此可以解决劳动力不足的问题。④产品质量比一般的机械加工更加稳定，径向误差在零点零八毫米以下。⑤适用于进行单个小批  生产的机床，只要重新调整，就可以自动地加工不同的零件。⑥对于外形特别复杂的加工部件，不用制造靠模就能迅速地投入生产，缩短了生产准备工作周期。⑦提高了生产效率，又保存了通用机床的灵活性。⑧改装工作一般机械制造厂都能进行，其他机床也能用同样原理实现自动化，比设计和制造专用自动化机床成本可以大大降低。
    齐金生创造的车床程序控制仪，不需要高级的电子管和复杂的凸轮机械，除了采用配电箱和变速箱以外，在机械部分上只安装了纵横向控制鼓，造价不过三百元左右。
    齐金生只念过五年书，在党的教育和培养下，他的思想觉悟和技术水平不断的提高，但他并没有满足。他在技术员刘奎英和刘德玲的帮助下，利用业余时间，苦战两个多月，绘制出了全部草图。齐金生在设计和制造车床程序控制仪过程中，失败过十三次，但齐金生并没有灰心。他坚决依靠党组织，依靠群众，在试制过程中，得到了葛文林、石增福、金孝润、廖振光、杨志荣、汤如昆、熊兆其、张淑琴等同志的热情帮助，终于试制成功。
