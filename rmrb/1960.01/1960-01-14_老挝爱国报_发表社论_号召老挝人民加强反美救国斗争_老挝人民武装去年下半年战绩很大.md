Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 13th: The "Laotian Patriotic Newspaper" published an editorial on the 9th, calling on the Laotian people to continue their anti-American national salvation struggle and overthrow the extremely reactionary leaders of the Laotian "Committee for the Defense of National Interests."

The editorial pointed out that this struggle is urgently needed to realize Laos' peace, neutrality, democracy, independence, unity, and prosperity.

The editorial pointed out that the leaders of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," after overthrowing the Phoui Sananikone government, are continuing to implement their extremely reactionary policies: namely, using force to eliminate patriotic and peace-loving forces, abandoning the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements, establishing a warlord dictatorship, and closely colluding with the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc in order to rapidly turn Laos into a new colony and war base for American imperialism.

The editorial pointed out that the leaders of the Laotian "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" have seized control of key departments such as national defense, foreign affairs, and finance and economy in the provisional government. They still hold full power to command the Royal Lao Army and are using the so-called "state of emergency" to suppress and persecute the people and use violence to threaten those who oppose them.

The editorial pointed out that currently, the leaders of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" are clamoring for "emergency general elections" in order to force the people to vote for them with bayonets, attempting to occupy a majority of seats in the National Assembly and turn the National Assembly into their tool, thereby further realizing their conspiracy to revise the constitution, establish a warlord dictatorship, and betray the country and harm the people.

The editorial emphasized that the actions of the leaders of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" prove that they are the most loyal and capable running dogs of the bellicose American interventionists, the most vicious and unreasonable dictatorial warlord elements who dream of abolishing all democratic freedoms of the people, and the executioners who slaughter the Laotian people. They are ready to sell Laos to American imperialism and the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc at any time.

The editorial called on the Laotian people of all strata to unite and struggle to overthrow the leaders of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" and drive the American interventionists out of Laos.

The editorial hoped that the Laotian provisional government would fulfill its promises, namely, implement a policy of peace and neutrality, bring peace, freedom, and happiness to the people, achieve national harmony and peaceful coexistence, and establish good-neighborly relations with all neighboring countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 13th: "Laotian Patriotic News" reported on January 8th on the anti-"mopping-up" achievements of the Laotian People's Armed Forces in the second half of 1959, saying: Since the American running dogs in Laos, especially the leaders of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," provoked a civil war to massacre the people, the Laotian people's anti-"mopping-up" movement has been developing day by day. In the past six months, the former Lao Fighting Units and the People's Armed Forces have conducted more than 500 anti-"mopping-up" battles. Nine hundred and sixteen soldiers of the Royal Army were killed, eight hundred and seventy-six were wounded, one hundred and fifty-one were captured, and one hundred and twenty-six surrendered. At the same time, one thousand one hundred and one soldiers of the Royal Army deserted, and about ten companies of the so-called "People's Self-Defense Forces" were disarmed or defected with their weapons.

According to reports, the People's Armed Forces seized many weapons, including six hundred and forty-three rifles, sixteen machine guns, eighty-eight submachine guns, thirty-nine carbines, eight pistols, thirty-one radio transmitters, and many military supplies, most of which were supplied to the Royal Army by the United States.

    “老挝爱国报”发表社论
    号召老挝人民加强反美救国斗争
    老挝人民武装去年下半年战绩很大
    据新华社河内13日电　“老挝爱国报”9日发表社论，号召老挝人民继续进行反美救国斗争，打倒老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的极端反动的头目们。
    社论指出，这一场斗争是为实现老挝的和平、中立、民主、独立、统一和富强而迫切需要进行的斗争。
    社论指出，“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们推翻培·萨纳尼空政府以后，正在继续推行它们极端反动的政策：即用武力消灭爱国、爱和平的力量，废弃日内瓦协议和万象协议，建立军阀独裁制度，紧密勾结东南亚侵略集团，以便把老挝迅速变成美帝国主义的新的殖民地和战争基地。
    社论指出，老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们在临时政府中霸据了国防、外交和财政经济等主要部门的权柄。他们仍然掌握着指挥老挝王国军队的全权，并且利用所谓“紧急状态”来镇压迫害人民和使用暴力威胁反对他们的人。
  社论指出，目前，“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们正在叫嚣要举行“紧急普选”，以便用刺刀强迫人民投他们的票，企图占据国民议会的多数席位，把国民议会变成他们的工具，从而进一步实现修改宪法、建立军阀独裁制度和叛国殃民的阴谋。
    社论强调指出，“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们的所作所为，证明了他们是好战的美国干涉者的最忠诚、最得力的走狗，是最凶恶、最不讲理、妄想取消人民的一切民主自由权利的独裁军阀分子，是杀害老挝人民的刽子手。他们随时准备把老挝出卖给美帝国主义和东南亚侵略集团。
    社论号召老挝各阶层人民联合起来进行斗争，打倒“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们，把美国干涉者赶出老挝。
    社论希望老挝临时政府实现自己的诺言，即执行和平中立政策，给人民带来和平、自由、幸福，实现民族和睦和和平共处，同各邻国建立睦邻关系。
    新华社河内13日电　“老挝爱国新闻”在1月8日报道老挝人民武装力量1959年下半年反“扫荡”战果说：自从美国在老挝的走狗，特别是“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们挑起屠杀人民的内战以后，老挝人民反“扫荡”的运动日益发展。在过去的六个月中，前寮国战斗部队和人民武装力量进行了五百多次反“扫荡”战，王国军队有九百一十六名被打死，八百七十六名受伤，一百五十一名被俘，一百二十六人投诚。在这同时，有一千一百零一名王国军队的士兵开小差，十个连左右的所谓“民卫队”被解除武装或携枪投诚。
    据报道，人民武装力量缴获了许多武器，其中包括六百四十三支步枪、十六挺机枪、八十八挺手提机枪、三十九支卡宾枪、八支短枪、三十一台无线电机和许多军事物资，这些武器和军事物资大多是美国供给王国军队的。
