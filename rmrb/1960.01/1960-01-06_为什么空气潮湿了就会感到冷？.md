Why does humid air feel colder?

Isn't cold and hot determined by temperature? Since the air temperature is the same, why does humid air feel colder? This is due to the physical properties of water vapor.

As everyone knows, the specific heat of water vapor is greater than that of dry air. Therefore, when the same amount of heat is given to two pieces of air with the same mass but different humidity, the temperature of the humid air rises less. When the skin comes into contact with the air, a process of thermal equilibrium occurs between them. The result is that the higher temperature skin transfers heat to the surrounding lower temperature thin layer of air, causing its temperature to rise. Because the skin temperature is basically constant, and for a certain instant, the temperature of the surrounding thin layer of air is also constant, after reaching thermal equilibrium, the surrounding thin layer of air's temperature rises, but it also has a certain temperature.

For air with different humidity, the amount of heat required to reach the same equilibrium temperature value is obviously different. Humid air has a larger specific heat, so the skin loses more heat in humid air, and therefore feels colder in humid air. If we put our hands separately into cold water and cold air of the same temperature, we will more clearly experience this point because the specific heat of water is greater than that of humid air.

Although the temperature in Nanjing is slightly higher than that in Beijing (the average temperature in January is 4.7°C and 2.0°C respectively), the relative humidity of the air (the ratio of the actual water vapor content to the maximum water vapor content in a certain volume of air) is much lower in Beijing than in Nanjing (the average in January is 49% and 74% respectively). Therefore, it seems that Nanjing feels colder than Beijing, which is the reason.

    冷热不是决定于温度么？既然空气温度相同，为什么空气潮湿了就会感到冷？这是由于水汽的物理特性所造成的。
    大家都知道，水汽的比热比干空气大，所以给同样质量的二块干、湿度不同的空气以同样的热量，湿空气的温度升高得就少一些。当皮肤和空气接触时，它们之间要发生热量平衡的过程，其结果是使温度较高的皮肤把热量传给它周围温度较低的空气薄层，并使它的温度升高。因为皮肤的温度基本上是一定的，而对于某一瞬时来讲，它周围空气薄层的温度也是一定的，所以达到热量平衡以后，周围的空气薄层温度升高了，但也有一定的温度。
    对于不同湿度的空气，要达到相同的平衡温度值，需要的热量，显然也是不同的。湿空气比热较大，所以皮肤在湿空气中损失的热量就要多一些，因而在潮湿空气中就感到冷一些。如果我们把双手分别放在相同温度的冷水和冷空气中，因为水的比热比湿空气更大，所以就会更明显地体会到这一点。
    南京的温度虽比北京略高：1月份平均温度分别为4．7℃和2．0℃，但空气的相对湿度（一定体积空气中实际水汽含量和最大水汽含量之比）北京比南京低得更多：1月份平均为49％和74％。所以在感觉上似乎南京比北京更冷，也就是这个道理。
