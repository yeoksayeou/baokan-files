Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th: The workers of the Datong Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province achieved a double leap forward in coal mining in the first two days of the new year. From January 1st to 2nd, the average daily output of raw coal increased by 11% compared to December of last year, and the tunneling progress increased by 21.4%.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 3rd: The workers of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine increased their coal production on January 1st by 48.28% compared to the average daily output in December of last year, firing the first shot of 1960.

In the coal seizing battle on New Year's Day, workers in each mine universally launched red flag competitions between districts, teams, and individuals. More than 220 coal mining teams in the Wangfeng Mine launched head-to-head competitions starting from zero hour on the 1st, universally promoting more than 20 advanced experiences, such as rapid chute shifting, blasting and loading coal, and increasing mining height and width. The first shift produced 2,444 tons of coal, exceeding the plan by 32%, achieving a successful start. The other three shifts quickly caught up, with each shift's output higher than the previous one. All five coal mining faces in the mine exceeded the production targets for a successful start that day.

In the coal seizing battle, leading cadres of each mine went deep into the shafts to focus on weak links such as transportation and electromechanical work, and fought alongside the workers. Sun Qing, Deputy Secretary of the Wangfeng Mine Party Committee, personally oversaw empty car dispatching, adopting a one-line dispatching method with fixed time, fixed quantity, and fixed location, increasing the car turnover rate from four times to six to seven times. All the coal produced by the mine that day was transported out in a timely manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 4th: More than 50,000 workers of the Zibo Mining Bureau in Shandong Province broke with the old convention of being lax at the beginning of the year, and achieved daily successes in the first three days of the new year. From January 1st to 3rd, the entire mining bureau produced more than 75,200 tons of raw coal, with an average daily output increase of 3.8% compared to December of last year. During these three days, the main tunnel excavation and raw coal ash content of each mine also reached the national standards.

The Zibo Mining Bureau applied the leadership experience of "dispersing downwards and concentrating upwards" from last year. Party secretaries and bureau directors and other leading cadres went to various mines one or two days before New Year's Day to assist in the work and understand the situation; on the 2nd, they rushed back to summarize the experience of a successful start, put forward new goals, and led the workers' full enthusiasm from one peak to another.

    新年第一炮  采掘双跃进
    大同、焦作、淄博各煤矿全面告捷
    据新华社太原4日电　山西省大同矿务局职工在新年头两天赢得采掘双跃进。1日到2日，原煤平均日产量比去年12月提高11％，掘进进度提高21．4％。
    新华社郑州3日电　焦作煤矿职工1月1日的采煤量，比去年12月平均日产量提高48．28％，打响了1960年的第一炮。
    各矿职工在元旦的夺煤大战中，普遍开展了区与区、组与组、人与人之间的红旗竞赛。王封矿二百二十多个采掘小组，从1日零点起开展了对口对手赛，普遍推广了快速移槽、爆破装煤加大采高采宽等二十多项先进经验。第一班产煤二千四百四十四吨，超过计划32％，获得首班开门红。其他三班急起直追，产量一班比一班高。这一天全矿五个采煤工作面都超过了开门红的生产指标。
    在夺煤战斗中，各矿领导干部都深入井下，抓运输、机电等薄弱环节，同职工一起并肩作战。王封矿党委副书记孙卿亲自抓空车调度，采取定时定量定地点的一条线的调度方法，使车皮周转率由四次增加到六至七次，全矿这天所产的煤都及时地运了出来。
    据新华社济南4日电　山东淄博矿务局五万多名职工破除年初松的老常规，在新年头三天取得了日日红的胜利。1日到3日，全矿务局共产原煤七万五千二百多吨，平均日产量比去年12月份增长3．8％。三天中，各矿的主要巷道掘进和原煤含?率，也都达到了国家规定的指标。
    淄博矿务局运用去年“分散下去，集中上来”的领导经验，党委书记和局长等领导干部在元旦前一两天就分别深入各矿帮助工作，摸摸情况；2日又赶回来总结开门红的经验，提出新的奋斗目标，把职工群众的饱满热情从一个高峰引向另一个高峰。
