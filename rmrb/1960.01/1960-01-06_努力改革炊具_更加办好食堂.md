The People's Daily published a report on December 8th last year about the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant's reform of cooking utensils, which mentioned that the plant's canteen, through vigorous technological innovation, had successively produced ten kinds of cooking machinery, such as rice washing, dishwashing, dough mixing, and vegetable cutting, basically achieving mechanization of cooking utensils. Today, our newspaper also reports that the 1,910 public canteens of the People's Communes in Tunzhang County, Shanxi Province, have produced more than 10,000 new cooking utensils, including vegetable cutting machines, noodle pressing machines, air blowers, and earthen water pipes, within half a month, and have reformed more than 1,200 grain processing tools of various kinds, basically achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization. As a result of these canteens' cooking utensil reforms, not only are fewer cooks needed, but also the variety of dishes has increased, and they are made more delicious.

The cooking utensil reforms reported in these two news items are major events with significant meaning and are worthy of our attention.

Cooking utensil reform can liberate a large amount of labor and greatly improve labor efficiency. Before this cooking utensil reform, whether in urban or rural areas, the vast majority of public canteen cooking labor was manual. Labor efficiency was low and heavy, occupying a large amount of relatively strong labor. The ratio of cooks to diners in many canteens was only one to forty, one to thirty, or even lower. Obviously, there is enormous potential for labor productivity here. This potential can be tapped through the path of technological innovation. The realm of technological innovation in cooking is very broad, and everything from cutting, washing, steaming, and boiling to raw grain processing (especially in rural areas) can be mechanized or semi-mechanized. Each cooking utensil reform can liberate a considerable amount of labor. After the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant canteen reformed its cooking utensils, the number of cooks was reduced from 147 to 83, a reduction of two-fifths, while the working hours of the cooks were shortened by a quarter, and the ratio of cooks to diners increased from one to forty-three to one to seventy-one. After Tunzhang County reformed its cooking utensils, the labor occupied by the canteens was reduced by more than two-thirds. One factory and one county have saved so much labor by implementing cooking utensil reform. It is not difficult to see that if public canteens in urban and rural areas across the country can promote cooking utensil reform, then millions of laborers will be liberated from manual labor. What a great force these laborers would be if they were投入 into industrial and agricultural production to accelerate socialist construction!

Through cooking utensil reform, canteens can be further improved. To run a canteen well, according to the current situation, the main criteria are nothing more than: hot food and fragrant dishes, frequent changes in variety, and low cost. How can these standards be achieved? In addition to improving cooking skills, the best way is to actively reform cooking utensils. No one will doubt that mechanization or semi-mechanization of cooking utensils can improve efficiency, but some people may worry about whether it can guarantee the quality of food. Some people may think that we have been using our hands to cook for thousands of years, and therefore believe that only handmade food is good, but this is not the case. The Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant uses a rice washing machine to wash 200 jin of rice in five minutes, and the bran and sand are all separated. Can manual washing achieve such good quality? The meat cutting machine cuts 50 jin of meat in 15 minutes, and can cut it into diced meat, sliced meat, or shredded meat as desired. Is there any inferiority compared to manual meat cutting? The canteen of this factory, due to the mechanization of cooking utensils, has reduced the heavy physical labor of the cooks, giving them time to study the variety of dishes. Now, more than 100 new recipes have been developed, and the daily staple and non-staple foods have increased from the original seven or eight kinds to about forty kinds. The canteens of the People's Communes in Tunzhang County have also used new cooking utensils to make coarse grains into fine foods, increase the variety of dishes, and save food. It can be seen that the worry about whether reforming cooking utensils can guarantee the quality of food is completely unnecessary.

The reform of cooking utensils can also liberate cooks from heavy labor. Manual operation and the use of backward tools are laborious, and the working hours of cooks are often prolonged. This reduces the time for learning, entertainment, and other necessary activities. Cooking utensil reform can change this situation, allowing them more time for political, cultural, and technical learning and proper entertainment, and also time to engage in sideline production, study and improve the variety of dishes, and strengthen hygiene work, which is also of great benefit to continuously improving the quality of meals and running public canteens well.

Public canteens are becoming increasingly important in our lives. Not only do industrial and mining enterprises, institutions, organizations, schools, and troops have long-established public canteens, but with the realization of people's communes and the leap forward in agricultural production, public canteens have spread to every corner of the countryside. Public canteens are directly related to the lives of hundreds of millions of people and indirectly related to the development of industrial and agricultural production and construction. In addition, there are still a considerable number of restaurants in cities. Therefore, vigorously launching a mass movement of technological innovation in public canteens and urban catering industries, gradually achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization, improving labor efficiency, and running canteens better has become a very important task and an integral part of the mass movement of technological innovation.

How can cooking utensil reform achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results? Our guiding principle is: self-reliance, making the best of what we have, starting with the rough and then refining, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. It is unrealistic to place all hope for cooking utensil reform on the state and rely on the state to supply all kinds of advanced cooking utensils. We must adhere to the principle of thrift, be self-reliant, and combine indigenous and foreign methods. As long as the goal of improving labor efficiency can be achieved, it can be done. It is certainly good if the reformed cooking utensils can improve efficiency by several times or dozens of times, and it is also good if they can improve efficiency by one time or even tens of percent; it is certainly good to use "foreign" machinery if conditions permit, and it is also good to create indigenous methods. From low efficiency to high efficiency, from rough to refined, from incomplete to complete, this is the inevitable process of cooking utensil reform. Therefore, we should have both great ambitions and down-to-earth actions for reforming cooking utensils. In cooking utensil reform, cooks and canteen managers are the main force and should actively study, learn from advanced experience, and strive to reform; however, reforming cooking utensils and running canteens well are related to the vital interests of the vast number of workers and commune members, so we should also widely mobilize the masses to offer ideas, find solutions, and participate in cooking utensil reform activities. In cooking utensil reform, local, especially commune, machinery factories should actively support, study cooking utensil reform, and manufacture some new-style demonstration cooking utensils.

We are in an era of continuous leap forward in production and construction, a great era of technological revolution and technological innovation. New technologies should not only be fully utilized in production departments, but also widely adopted in living service departments in order to better serve the people. Whether in production departments or living service departments, the more arduous the labor and the more labor-intensive the place, the more necessary it is to reform technology, create new-style tools, and improve labor efficiency. Cooking utensil reform is a major event. Now, many industrial and mining enterprises, urban restaurants, and other units have begun to pay attention to the reform of canteen cooking utensils, and many people's communes are also seizing the opportunity to improve rural collective welfare undertakings, and taking running canteens well and reforming cooking utensils as one of the important contents. We believe that as long as all localities attach importance to this work, strengthen leadership, mobilize the masses, exert full energy, actively take action, and exchange experiences in a timely manner, the mechanization and semi-mechanization of cooking utensils will certainly be gradually realized.

Comrades cooks of canteens in factories, communes, government agencies, schools, and service departments across the country, as you enter the great year of 1960, we hope that you will also have great ambitions in greatly reforming cooking utensils and striving to run canteens well. We hope that you will also have a grand competition and wish you to make great contributions to the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production!

### 努力改革炊具　更加办好食堂

    努力改革炊具　更加办好食堂
    去年12月8日，本报发表的北京第一机床厂改革炊具的报道，曾经谈到这个厂的食堂由于大搞技术革新，陆续制成淘米、洗碗、和面、切菜等十种炊事机械，基本上实现了炊具机械化。今天本报又报道了山西省屯长县各人民公社一千九百一十个公共食堂，在半个月内制成了切菜机、压面机、吹风机、土自来水管等新炊具一万多件，并且改革了各种粮食加工工具一千二百多件，基本上实现了机械化和半机械化。这些食堂进行炊具改革的结果，不只是炊事人员用得少了，而且饭菜的花样多了，作得更好吃了。
    这两则新闻中报道的炊具改革是一件大事，有很重要的意义，很值得引起我们的重视。
    炊具改革能够解放大量劳动力，大大地提高劳动效率。在这次炊具改革以前，不论城市农村，绝大部分公共食堂的炊事劳动都是手工操作的。劳动效率低而繁重，占用了大量的较强的劳动力。许多食堂的炊事人员与用饭人员的比例只达到一比四十、一比三十，甚至更低。很显然，这其中蕴藏着巨大的劳动力的潜力。通过技术革新的道路，就能把潜力挖掘出来。炊事方面技术革新的天地是十分广阔的，从切洗蒸煮到原粮加工（特别是在农村），都可以实现机械化或半机械化。每一种炊具的改革，都能够解放出相当数量的劳动力。北京第一机床厂食堂炊具改革以后，炊事人员由一百四十七人减少到八十三人，即减少了五分之二，而炊事人员的工作时间却缩短了四分之一，炊事人员和用饭职工的比例从一比四十三提高到一比七十一。屯长县改革炊具以后，食堂占用的劳动力减少了三分之二还多。一个工厂、一个县由于实行了炊具改革，就节省出这样多的劳动力，不难看出，如果全国城乡的公共食堂都能推行炊具改革，那末将会有成百万的劳动力从手工操作中解放出来。这些劳动力投入工农业生产，对加速社会主义建设该是一支多么大的力量！
    通过炊具改革还能够进一步把食堂办好。把食堂办好，按照目前的情况，主要标准不外这样几个：饭热菜香，花样经常变化，费用较少。怎样才能达到这样的标准呢？除了提高炊事技术以外，最好的办法就是积极改革炊事用具。炊事用具机械化或半机械化能够提高效率，这不会有人怀疑，但是能不能保证饭菜质量，也许就有人担心。可能有人认为，千百年来我们就是用双手做饭做菜，因此认定只有手工做的才好，其实事情并不是这样。北京第一机床厂使用淘米机，五分钟洗好大米二百斤，糠秕和砂子统统被分离了出去，用手工能达到这样好的质量吗？切肉机十五分钟切肉五十斤，而且随人所欲切成肉丁、肉片、肉丝，这与手工切肉相比有什么逊色？这个工厂食堂，由于实现了炊具机械化，减轻了炊事人员繁重的体力劳动，使得他们有时间研究饭菜花样，现在已制定了一百多种新食谱，每天的主副食品，从原来的七八种，增加到四十种左右。屯长县各人民公社的食堂也由于使用了新炊具，粗粮细做，增加了饭菜花样，又节约了粮食。可见，对改革炊具能不能保证饭菜质量的担心，是完全不必要的。
    炊事用具的改革，还可以使炊事人员从笨重的劳动里解放出来。手工操作和使用落后工具的劳动是繁重的，炊事人员的工作时间往往拖得较长。这样就减少了学习、娱乐和其他必要活动的时间。炊具改革就可以改变这种状况，使他们能有较多的时间从事政治、文化、技术学习和正当娱乐，而且能够有时间从事副业生产，研究改进饭菜花样，加强卫生工作，这对不断提高伙食质量办好公共食堂，也有很大好处。
    公共食堂在我们的生活里愈来愈显得重要了。不仅工矿企业、机关、团体、学校、部队有着举办已久的公共食堂，而且随着人民公社化实现和农业生产的跃进，公共食堂已遍及农村各个角落。公共食堂直接关系数以亿计的人民的生活，间接关系工农业生产建设的发展。另外，在城市也还有相当数量的饮食店。因此在公共食堂和城市饮食业中大力开展技术革新的群众运动，逐步实现机械化和半机械化，提高劳动效率，把食堂办得更好，就成为一件很重要的工作，成为技术革新的群众运动的一个组成部分。
    炊具改革，怎样才能取得多快好省的效果呢？我们的方针是：自力更生，因陋就简，先粗后精，土洋并举。把实行炊具改革的希望完全寄托在国家身上，依赖国家供应各种先进炊具的想法，是不现实的。必须遵守节约的原则，自力更生，土洋并举，只要能够达到提高劳动效率的目的，就可以办。改革后的炊具，如果能够提高效率几倍几十倍固然很好，就是提高效率一倍乃至百分之几十也很好；有条件采用“洋”机械固然很好，创造土办法也很好。从效率低到效率高、从粗糙到精致、从不够完整到完整，这是炊具改革的必然过程。因此，对于改革炊具，也应当是既抱有雄心大志，又有脚踏实地的行动。在炊具改革中，炊事人员和食堂管理人员是主力军，应该积极钻研，学习先进经验，努力进行改革；但是，改革炊具、办好食堂，关系着广大职工和广大社员的切身利益，因此也应当广泛发动群众出主意，想办法，参加炊具改革的活动。在炊具改革中，地方的特别是公社的机械厂，应该积极支持，研究炊具改革并制造一些新式示范炊具。
    我们正处在生产建设不断跃进的时代，这是技术革命和技术革新的伟大时代。新技术不仅在生产部门应当得到充分运用，在生活服务部门也应当广泛采用，以便更好地为人民服务。无论生产部门或生活服务部门，愈是繁重的劳动，愈是占用劳动力多的地方，愈是需要革新技术，创造新式工具，提高劳动效率。炊具改革是一件大事，现在，许多工矿企业、城市饮食店等单位，已经开始注意食堂炊具的改革，许多人民公社也正抓紧搞好农村集体福利事业，并且把办好食堂、改革炊具作为重要内容之一。我们相信，只要各地都重视这个工作，加强领导，发动群众，鼓足干劲，积极行动起来，及时交流经验，炊具的机械化和半机械化是一定能逐步实现的。
    全国各厂、各社、各机关、各学校、各服务部门的食堂炊事员同志们，在你们进入伟大的1960年的时候，希望你们在大大改革炊事用具、努力办好食堂方面也立下雄图大志，希望你们也来一个大竞赛，祝你们为工农业生产继续跃进建立奇功！
