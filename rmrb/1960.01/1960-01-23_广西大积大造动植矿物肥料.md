Xinhua News Agency, Nanning: Rural areas in Guangxi are vigorously promoting pig raising and manure accumulation, and are focusing on basic fertilizer construction to prepare sufficient fertilizer for spring plowing. As of early January, the entire autonomous region had an average of about 50 dan of concentrated fertilizer per mu of spring-sown land. More than 1.1 million pig and cattle pens in fields, fertilizer stations in fields, and manure pits at field heads have been established, along with more than 10,000 local chemical fertilizer plants.

The characteristic of this fertilizer accumulation movement in Guangxi is that it focuses on raising pigs to accumulate manure, and vigorously promotes animal, plant, and mineral fertilizers. By the end of December last year, Guilin Prefecture had more than 1.2 million pigs in stock, an average of more than two per household, greatly increasing the amount of fertilizer accumulated. Resources County alone accumulated more than 4.4 million dan of pig, cattle, horse, sheep, chicken, and duck manure. At present, while protecting livestock for the winter, all regions are diligently padding pens and cleaning, greatly increasing manure production rates. All regions are also vigorously promoting plant fertilizers. This year, the area sown with green manure in the entire autonomous region has more than doubled compared to 1958. At the same time, all regions are actively fertilizing and ditching green manure fields, and doing a good job in frost protection and insulation. All regions are also making full use of the favorable conditions of the evergreen subtropical region to cut green plants in large quantities for composting and burning grass and wood ash. In addition, regions from the county to the commune and team levels are building kilns and factories to manufacture local chemical fertilizers and mixed fertilizers. There are currently more than 10,000 chemical fertilizer plants in the entire autonomous region.

In order to reduce the labor force for accumulating and transporting fertilizer and to change the situation of insufficient fertilization in distant and barren fields, all regions are vigorously carrying out fertilizer base construction, bringing the vast "fertilizer factories" closer to raw material producing areas and cultivated land.

    广西大积大造动植矿物肥料
    据新华社南宁讯　广西各地农村大搞养猪积肥，大抓肥料基本建设，为春耕准备充足的肥料。到元月上旬止，全自治区平均每亩春种土地已有精肥五十担左右，建立田头猪牛栏、田间肥料站和田头粪坑共一百一十多万个，土化肥厂一万多个。
    广西各地这次积肥运动的特点，是以养猪积肥为主，大抓动、植、矿物肥料。桂林专区到去年12月底，全专区存栏猪达一百二十万多头，平均每户有两头多，积肥量大增。资源县仅猪、牛、马、羊、鸡、鸭粪就积有四百四十多万担。目前，各地结合保护牲畜过冬，做到了勤垫栏、勤打扫，出粪率大大提高。各地还大抓植物肥料。全自治区今年冬种绿肥面积比1958年翻一番半。同时，各地积极为绿肥田施肥开沟，做好防冻保暖工作。各地还充分利用亚热带四季常青的有利条件，大量割青沤肥，烧草木灰。此外，各地从县到社、队，建窑建厂，制造土化肥和混合肥，全自治区现有化肥厂一万多个。
    为了减少积肥、送肥的劳动力，改变远田、瘦田施肥不足的情况，各地大搞肥料基地建设，使广大的“肥料工厂”接近原料产地和耕地。
