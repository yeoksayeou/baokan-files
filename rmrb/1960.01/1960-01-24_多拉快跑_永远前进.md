    Pull More, Run Faster, Advance Forever
    All Employees of the Mao Zedong Locomotive Crew

    The 1959 national economic communique has greatly inspired us. We will certainly continue to hold high the red flag of the General Line, overcome wind, snow, and heat, and comprehensively overfulfill this year's transportation tasks.

    By the end of last year, our locomotive had safely traveled for thirteen years, reaching more than 1.1 million kilometers. In the past six years, we have transported an additional 389,000 tons of goods and saved 2,183 tons of coal. Recently, we have formulated a leap forward plan for 1960: In terms of safety, maintain the glorious record of safe operation; in terms of pulling more and running faster, strive to pull more than 3,000 additional wagonloads of goods; increase the running speed by 2.2 kilometers per hour compared to the prescribed target; and save 595 tons of coal, reducing coal consumption by about 10% compared to the coal consumption quota. Although our locomotive is old, we will carefully maintain it, ensure the quality of operation, and surpass new locomotives.

    1959年国民经济公报给我们的鼓舞真是太大了，我们一定继续高举总路线的红旗，战胜风雪和炎热，全面超额完成今年的运输任务。
    到去年年底，我们的机车已安全行走了十三年，达一百一十多万公里。近六年来，我们多运了三十八万九千多吨货物，节约了煤炭二千一百八十三吨。最近，我们又制定了1960年的跃进计划：在安全方面，保持安全运行的光荣纪录；在多拉快跑方面，争取再多拉三千多个车皮的货物；行驶速度比规定指标每小时提高二点二公里；节煤五百九十五吨，比耗煤定额降低10％左右。我们的机车虽然老了，但是，我们要细心保养，保证运行质量，超过新型机车。
