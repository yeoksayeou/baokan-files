Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 14th: Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels and with the support of the broad masses, agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province have been further consolidated, improved, and have achieved new development. They have become an integral part of the people's communes throughout the province, playing an increasingly significant role in rural economic and cultural construction.

Agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province were established during the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and have consistently received Party support during their development. Currently, there are over two thousand agricultural middle schools throughout the province. Thanks to the vigorous allocation and training of teachers by Party organizations and education departments at all levels, agricultural middle schools across the province now have a teaching staff of over seven thousand eight hundred people. In 1959, Party committees of various communes successively assigned more than one thousand nine hundred cadres to serve as principals and deans of studies in agricultural middle schools, nearly half of whom were Communist Party members. People's communes in various localities dispatched many experienced farmers to serve as production instructors and teaching consultants for the agricultural middle schools. At present, most agricultural middle schools throughout the province have full-time cadres leading teaching and production. With the active assistance of the commune Party committees, all agricultural middle schools have established production bases, cultivating a total of over 115,000 mu of land. Some agricultural middle schools have also set up various small-scale factories and workshops, totaling one thousand four hundred and forty-six. The problem of school buildings for agricultural middle schools throughout the province has been basically resolved. The teaching equipment in most schools has begun to take shape, and necessary books and instruments are being gradually enriched. The rules and regulations of the schools have been gradually established. After more than a year of active efforts, the proportion of agricultural middle schools that are well-run and have achieved significant results has increased from 30% in the first half of 1959 to 60%; the number of poorly-run schools with many problems has decreased from about 20% to about 3%. The new students enrolled in 1958 have already advanced to the second grade of junior high school. After the summer vacation of 1959, various localities enrolled more than one hundred thousand new students, and fifty agricultural middle schools with a relatively solid foundation also added senior high school classes.

Over the past year, while adhering to the principle of part-work, part-study, agricultural middle schools throughout the province have properly arranged teaching, productive labor, and student life, and have gradually established normal teaching order. The part-work, part-study system in agricultural middle schools generally implements half-day or alternate-day schedules, ensuring that classes are held at the prescribed times, and most schools are able to complete their teaching tasks on schedule. Many schools have further revised their teaching plans, adding courses such as physics and chemistry. According to surveys conducted in the Yancheng and Suzhou Special Districts, about half of the agricultural middle schools have already approached or caught up with the level of full-time junior high school students of the same grade in the two major subjects of Chinese language and mathematics.

In terms of productive labor, agricultural middle schools throughout the province have also achieved great results. After the establishment of people's communes, the production, supply, and sales of school production were uniformly incorporated into the commune's plans. According to incomplete statistics, the total value of production labor by agricultural middle school students throughout the province over the past year reached more than 6.18 million yuan, of which the net profit was more than 4.74 million yuan. More than one thousand one hundred schools have already achieved self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency. Some schools have even used production income for school infrastructure construction.

Now, agricultural middle schools have become an important base for improving rural culture and promoting advanced agricultural technologies. Farmers in many places have learned advanced production techniques from agricultural middle schools. In Rugao County alone, since 1959, fifty-four communes have held more than one hundred on-site meetings at agricultural middle schools, with the attendance of over 96,000 production team leaders and activists. Students from agricultural middle schools also actively participate in social and cultural activities, serving as teachers in literacy classes and amateur cultural and technical schools, becoming active participants in rural cultural activities.

In order to widely exchange experiences and meet the new situation and new developments of 1960, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee recently convened a representative conference of advanced units and advanced workers of agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province. Lu Dingyi, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, and Vice Premier of the State Council, wrote a letter congratulating the conference. The Ministry of Education also wrote a congratulatory letter to the conference. (Attached picture)

    江苏农业中学办得多办得好
    普遍建立生产基地，半数以上实现自给或半自给
    已经成为提高农村文化推广先进技术的重要基地
    据新华社南京14日电　江苏省各地农业中学在各级党委的领导和广大群众的支持下，进一步巩固提高，获得了新的发展。它们已经成为全省各地人民公社的一个组成部分，在农村经济建设和文化建设中发挥着日益明显的作用。
    江苏省各地农业中学是1958年大跃进中建立起来的，发展中一直受到党的扶持。现在全省农业中学已发展到两千多个，由于各级党组织和教育部门大力为农业中学调派、培训师资，全省农业中学已拥有一支七千八百多人的教师队伍。1959年，各地公社党委先后加派了一千九百多名干部担任农业中学的校长和教务主任，这些干部有近一半是共产党员。各地人民公社调派了不少老农给农业中学当生产指导，作教学顾问。目前，全省一般农业中学都有了领导教学和领导生产的专职干部。在公社党委的积极帮助下，所有农业中学都已建立起生产基地，共种地十一万五千多亩。一部分农业中学还办起了各种小型工厂、作坊，共一千四百四十六个。全省农业中学的校舍问题已经基本得到解决，一般学校的教学设备已经初具规模，必要的图书、仪器正在逐步充实，学校的规章制度已经逐步建立起来。经过一年多来的积极努力，办得比较好、成绩比较显著的农业中学的比例，已由1959年上半年的30％上升到60％；办得比较差、问题比较多的学校，已由20％下降到3％左右。1958年招收的新生，已升到初中二年级学习。1959年暑假以后，各地又招收了十万多个新生入学，并且还有基础较好的五十所农业中学增办了高中班。
    一年多来，全省农业中学在坚持半耕半读的前提下，都妥善地安排了教学、生产劳动和学生生活，逐步建立了正常的教学秩序。农业中学的半耕半读，一般实行半日制或隔日制，能按规定时间上课，大部分学校都能按期完成教学任务。许多学校已进一步修订教学计划，增设物理、化学等课程。据盐城和苏州专区的调查，目前有一半左右的农业中学，在语文、数学这两门主要学科方面，已经接近或赶上当地同期举办的全日制初中学生的水平。
    生产劳动方面，全省农业中学也取得了很大成绩。人民公社化后，各公社将学校生产的产、供、销统一纳入了公社的计划。据不完全的统计：一年来全省农业中学生产劳动的总产值达六百十八万多元，其中纯收益四百七十四万多元。有一千一百多所学校，已经实行自给或半自给。有的学校还用生产收入进行学校的基本建设。
    现在，农业中学已经成为提高农村文化和推广农业先进技术的一个重要基地。很多地方的农民群众向农业中学学习了先进生产技术，仅如皋县，1959年以来就先后有五十四个公社在农业中学召开一百多次现场会议，到会学习的生产队长和积极分子达九万六千多人次。农业中学的学生还积极参加社会活动和文化活动，担任扫盲和业余文化技术学校的教师，成为农村文化活动中的积极分子。
    为了广泛交流经验，迎接1960年的新形势和新发展，最近中共江苏省委和省人民委员会召开了江苏省农业中学先进单位和先进工作者代表会议。中共中央政治局候补委员、中共中央宣传部部长、国务院副总理陆定一曾写信向会议祝贺。教育部也给会议写来了贺信。（附图片）
