Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 6th. Guizhou Province's first iron and steel complex, the Guiyang Iron and Steel Plant's first phase of construction, has been fully completed and put into production. It mainly includes two converter workshops, one electric furnace workshop, two rolling mill workshops, four blast furnaces, a refractory material plant, as well as a mining base and railway spur lines. The completion and commissioning of these projects provide more favorable conditions for supporting the continued leap forward in the province's industrial and agricultural production.

The Guiyang Iron and Steel Plant began construction in April 1958. According to the original design, it was a small iron and steel complex. After the mass campaign to produce steel in 1958, under the guidance of the Party's policies of "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward" and "walking on two legs," the construction scale of this iron and steel plant was repeatedly expanded, and the construction speed was repeatedly accelerated. Compared with the original designed capacity, the production capacity of pig iron has increased by 66%, steel has increased by two times, and steel products have increased by nearly three times. Due to the implementation of the principle of "building and producing at the same time," the Guiyang Iron and Steel Plant had already produced a large amount of pig iron, steel, and steel products before the completion of the first phase of the project, completing and exceeding the 1959 production plan ahead of schedule, and supporting the industrial and agricultural production in various parts of Guizhou. At present, the second phase of the Guiyang Iron and Steel Plant, which is larger in scale, has also begun construction.

    贵州首座钢铁企业初具规模
    第一期建设的炼钢、炼铁、矿山等工程全部竣工
    新华社贵阳6日电　贵州省第一个钢铁联合企业——贵阳钢铁厂的第一期工程，已经全部竣工投入生产，它主要包括两个转炉车间，一个电炉车间，两个轧钢车间，四个高炉，一座耐火材料厂，还有矿山基地和铁路专用线等。这些项目的建成和投入生产，为支援全省工农业生产的继续跃进提供了更有利的条件。
    贵阳钢铁厂是在1958年4月动工兴建的。按照最初的设计，原是一个小型的钢铁联合企业。1958年，全民大办钢铁以后，在党的“以钢为纲，全面跃进”和“两条腿走路”的方针指导下，这个钢铁厂的建设规模一再扩大，建设速度一再加快。以目前投入生产的设备能力同原设计能力比较，生铁提高66％，钢提高两倍，钢材提高近三倍。由于执行“边建设，边生产”的方针，贵阳钢铁厂在第一期工程完成前就已经生产出大量的生铁、钢和钢材，提前并超额完成了1959年度的生产计划，支援了贵州各地的工农业生产。目前，贵阳钢铁厂规模更大的第二期工程又已动工。
