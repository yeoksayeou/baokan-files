    New Situation, New Stage, New Tasks
    Ouyang Qin, First Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    The victorious year of 1959 has ended, and the year of 1960, which will bring us even greater victories, has arrived.
    In the past year, Heilongjiang Province, like all parts of the country, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, achieved great victories in continuing the Great Leap Forward. The province completed and overfulfilled the 1959 plans for industrial production, agricultural production, capital construction, transportation, and financial trade by the end of November, one month ahead of schedule. The total value of industrial and agricultural output for the year will increase by about 29% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, with industrial output value increasing by about 35% and agricultural output value increasing by more than 15%. The output of major products such as steel, iron, machinery and equipment, coal, timber, grain, and soybeans has increased significantly compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Since the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the policy of making up for "short legs" at the end of 1958, light industry and diversified agricultural management have also made significant progress in the past year. The main indicators of Heilongjiang Province's original Second Five-Year Plan have been successfully completed and overfulfilled three years ahead of schedule. With the development of production, all other aspects of work in the province have also achieved great results, presenting a thriving and flourishing situation.
    The facts of the continuous Great Leap Forward and bumper harvests in 1958 and 1959 have made it clear to people how the people of the province, under the guidance and encouragement of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, have developed the infinite power and wisdom of the masses of the people in creating history. They have created extraordinary miracles in ordinary labor. Facts fully prove that the Party's General Line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies are completely correct. Under the guidance of this general line, China's socialist construction can not only develop at a high speed and in proportion, but also ensure that this high speed can be sustained. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out as early as March 1949 at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party: "China's economic legacy is backward, but the Chinese people are brave and industrious. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic, the leadership of the Communist Party of China, coupled with the assistance of the proletariat of all countries in the world, especially the assistance of the Soviet Union, will mean that the speed of China's economic construction will not be slow but may be quite fast, and China's prosperity can be counted on the agenda." On the basis of the victory of the First Five-Year Plan, the facts of the continuous Great Leap Forward and bumper harvests in Heilongjiang Province and the whole country in the past two years have further proved that this prediction of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong is completely correct. We are even more full of infinite confidence, hope, and strength in the brilliant prospects of our socialist construction.
    Heilongjiang Province is one of the key construction areas of the country's First Five-Year Plan. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong and with the strong support of the people of the whole country, the General Line of the Party's socialist revolution and the General Line of socialist construction have been implemented. After the construction during the First Five-Year Plan and the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958-1959, the province's economic situation has undergone tremendous and profound changes and reached a new stage of development. Heilongjiang Province has been transformed from a poor and backward "Great Northern Wilderness" with an extremely weak industrial base into a new and important industrial base of the country with heavy industry as the center and modern large-scale enterprises as the backbone. The proportion of industrial output value in the total value of industrial and agricultural output has reached about 75%. Heilongjiang Province now has a fairly strong modern machinery industry, coal industry, and forestry industry. The original steel industry, which was a weak link, has also made great progress. The province has formed a transportation network centered on 4,000 kilometers of railways, including highways and shipping. The entire industry has a fairly solid foundation.
    In the vast rural areas, people's communes have embarked on a path of consolidation and sound development. At the same time, powerful state-owned agricultural and livestock farms and many non-staple food bases have also been established. Agricultural mechanization has a preliminary foundation, and the area under mechanized cultivation has reached more than 20% of the arable land. Due to the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, the ability of agricultural production to resist natural disasters has been greatly enhanced. With industry now able to provide greater support for the technical transformation of agriculture, rural areas are facing a new situation of comprehensively and massively promoting agricultural mechanization and taking grain as the key link, developing agriculture and industry in parallel, and promoting the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.
    With the high-speed advancement of production and construction, financial and trade, political and legal, scientific, educational, cultural, health and other undertakings have also made great progress. The material and cultural life of the people has been greatly improved, their socialist and communist consciousness has been significantly enhanced, and their spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes.
    In terms of Party building, through the rich struggle of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, the Marxist-Leninist level of Party members and cadres has been greatly improved, the unity of the Party has been unprecedentedly consolidated, the prestige of the Party has been unprecedentedly enhanced, the leading cores of Party organizations at all levels have become stronger, the ranks of cadres in all aspects have continued to grow, and Party organizations and cadres at all levels have accumulated rich experience in socialist revolution and socialist construction. The above are some of the main signs of the new situation and the main characteristics of entering a new stage in the socialist construction of Heilongjiang Province.
    We Communists are believers in the Marxist-Leninist theory of continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development. In leading the revolutionary struggle of the masses of the people, Communists must be good at scientifically analyzing the situation at each stage of the revolutionary process, pointing out the direction of advance in a timely manner, and proposing new revolutionary tasks, so that the revolutionary and construction undertakings of the masses of the people will not stagnate midway because they are satisfied with their achievements. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have consistently used this Marxist-Leninist theory to guide China's revolution and construction for a long time, so that the revolution has always advanced from one stage to another and from one victory to another without missing the opportunity. Now that the socialist construction of Heilongjiang Province has entered a new stage, we must, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development, consciously and timely clarify and grasp this new situation and put forward new combat tasks, in order to mobilize and organize the people of the province to strive for new and greater victories.
    According to the new situation of socialist construction development in Heilongjiang Province, the main tasks of Heilongjiang Province in the future are: to continue to implement the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, in accordance with the spirit of "fully tapping potential, vigorously supporting the whole country, strengthening comprehensive development, and gradually rationalizing the layout" and "relying on the Party, relying on the masses, having a center, having a backbone, comprehensively planning, and comprehensively leaping forward," under the unified planning of the Central Government, while continuing to complete the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, comprehensively accelerate the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, and comprehensively arrange the national economy on the basis of agriculture, develop production at a high speed and in proportion, and strive for a sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward. In agriculture, we must accelerate the realization of agricultural modernization; develop diversified management with grain as the key link, promote the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and vigorously develop animal husbandry with pig raising as the center; and further change the natural appearance of the countryside. In industry, we must comprehensively leap forward with steel as the key link; continue to carry out technological transformation, improve the level of mechanization and automation of industry, actively develop the comprehensive utilization of various resources, and develop in the direction of high, large, precise, sharp, and new. At the same time, actively develop small and medium-sized industries, so that large, medium, and small are combined; actively strengthen the construction of light industry, transportation, and urban construction, and some weak links in heavy industry, so that the development of various industrial departments is mutually adapted and gradually realize the rational layout of industry. Vigorously develop and improve science and technology, culture and education, establish a strong scientific and technological force and a Marxist-Leninist theoretical force, master cutting-edge technologies, and climb the peak of science.
    All these are in order to better complete the task of vigorously supporting the whole country; at the same time, build Heilongjiang Province into a more prosperous, happy, and beautiful place; and closely cooperate with the fraternal regions of Northeast China, and strive to build the Northeast region into a relatively complete economic system with heavy industry as the center, industry and agriculture, light industry and heavy industry mutually adapted, large, medium, and small combined, a more rational layout, and modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, in coordination with the whole country, in order to make more and greater contributions to the country's socialist construction. On the basis of developing production and improving labor productivity, gradually improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. All tasks in Heilongjiang Province in 1960 should be arranged in accordance with the above-mentioned general goal. Under this general goal, 1960 in Heilongjiang Province will be a situation of sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward, and the total value of industrial and agricultural output in Heilongjiang Province in 1960 will have a greater increase than in 1959, and the proportions between industry and agriculture, light industry and heavy industry, and grain and diversified management will be more mutually adapted. Financial trade, science, culture, education, health, and urban construction will all have rapid development, and people's lives will be further improved. The victorious realization of the tasks in 1960 will further change the face of Heilongjiang Province and create more favorable conditions for continuing to complete the tasks in the new stage in the future.
    In order to realize the new stage of socialist construction in Heilongjiang Province and the tasks in 1960, and strive for a sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward, we must resolutely continue to implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies. Continue to implement the policy of putting politics in command and vigorously launching mass movements. Continue to deeply launch the technical innovation movement.
    Adhering to putting politics in command and vigorously launching mass movements is the fundamental method to fully develop the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of the people, thereby better implementing the General Line for socialist construction and developing China's socialist economy at a high speed. The Party is the leader and organizer of all victories, ideological and political work is the soul and commander of all work, and the masses are the creators of history and all material wealth and spiritual wealth. The masses contain infinite potential. Under the leadership of the Party, they have not only relied on their own strength to break an old world and liberate themselves, but also have the full power to build a new world and create their own beautiful new life. As long as we strengthen the leadership of the Party, fully mobilize the masses, and constantly strengthen the Party's ideological and political work, educate the masses with Marxist-Leninist thought, and encourage and develop the infinite wisdom, enthusiasm, and creativity of the masses, our cause will be invincible. The practice of Heilongjiang Province's continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years has provided rich experience and proof in this regard. In order to achieve victory in future work, we must apply and develop existing experience in all work and continue to adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously launching mass movements.
    Our cause is arduous and great. Without the guidance of revolutionary theory and a deep understanding of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, it would be impossible to achieve victory. To this end, all cadres in Heilongjiang Province must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, constantly improve their theoretical literacy, and defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and fight against all tendencies that deviate from the Party's correct line. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the theoretical basis for guiding all our work and the guide to action in the revolutionary struggle. Learning and mastering Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for winning the victory in the construction tasks in the new stage.
    In the rapid development of socialist construction, advanced figures and advanced experiences are constantly emerging. In the past few years, various places in Heilongjiang Province have created and promoted many advanced experiences, such as the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" in enterprise management, the "building block machine tools," "automatic production lines," "simplified step-up ring power supply," and "production sports meets" in industrial production; the "new technology experimental building" in capital construction, etc., as well as many advanced experiences in agriculture, finance and trade, and science, culture, and education, which have all played a powerful role in promoting socialist construction. Advanced figures and advanced experiences have a great promoting effect on the development of social production. In the future construction, advanced experiences will inevitably continue to emerge, and the rapid popularization of advanced experiences to the experiences of the whole society will continuously improve the level of social production and accelerate socialist construction. Therefore, we should attach great importance to, encourage, and develop the creativity of the masses, support all innovations and new things that can promote production and work, and seize the work of summarizing and promoting advanced experiences. We must also continue to learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as fraternal regions in China, in order to accelerate our socialist construction.
    The unity of the Party is the most basic condition for uniting all the people to carry out socialist construction. As long as the whole Party and the whole people are united, work together with one heart and one mind, our strength will be infinite, and all undertakings will have the fundamental guarantee of victory. In order to realize the great construction tasks in the new stage, Party organizations and people throughout the province must unite more closely, unite under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, unite around the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, unite around the Party's General Line for socialist construction, and unite around Party organizations and their leading cores at all levels. In this way, our cause will surely continue to achieve new and greater achievements.
    Now our country is experiencing an era of great historical leaps, and the situation is extremely good. Internationally, the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is constantly growing, unity continues to be strengthened, and the national independence movement against imperialism and colonialism and the forces of peace-loving people throughout the world are also continuing to develop and grow. No matter what disguise the imperialists wear, they cannot hide the eyes and ears of the world, nor can they overcome their numerous contradictions and escape their dying situation. The fundamental situation in international politics is that the East wind prevails over the West wind. Domestically, the whole situation is even brighter. The banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are raised higher and higher. The production and capital construction plans for 1959 have been completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule, and everywhere presents an extremely active situation of prosperity. Our country is in a flourishing atmosphere. No force can stop us from rushing forward on the road of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. We have already achieved extremely great achievements in the past, and we will achieve new and greater achievements in the future. The revolution we are carrying out has no end. Our future is extremely bright. Our cause is very great. We must have the lofty ideals and ambitions of communism, and consciously shoulder the important task of transforming the old world and building a new world. The life of a Communist is a life of continuous learning, continuous struggle, and continuous development and progress. We must always maintain youthful vitality and always be promoters of the revolution. On our road forward, although we will still encounter difficulties of one kind or another, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. The major tasks of socialist construction in the new era will surely be victoriously realized.
    Let us, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and under the brilliant light of the General Line, unite more closely, work hard with high morale, humility, and prudence, and strive to build our country a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Let us forge ahead to build Heilongjiang Province into a more prosperous, happy, and beautiful place.

    新形势、新阶段、新任务
    中共黑龙江省委第一书记　欧阳钦
    满载胜利的1959年已经结束了，将给我们带来更大胜利的1960年来到了。
    在过去的一年中，黑龙江省和全国各地一样，在党中央、毛泽东同志的英明领导下，在1958年大跃进的基础上，获得了继续大跃进的伟大胜利。全省提前一个月于11月底就完成和超额完成了1959年的工业生产、农业生产、基本建设、交通运输、财政贸易的计划。全年工农业总产值将比大跃进的1958年增长29％左右，其中工业产值增长35％左右，农业产值增长15％以上。钢、铁、机械设备、煤炭、木材以及粮食、大豆等主要产品的产量，都比大跃进的1958年有很大的增长。自从中共黑龙江省委在1958年底提出将“短腿”补长的方针以后，一年来轻工业和农业的多种经营也有了显著的发展。黑龙江省原订的第二个五年计划的主要指标已经提前三年胜利完成和超额完成。随着生产的发展，全省其它方面的工作也都取得了很大的成绩，呈现着欣欣向荣、蒸蒸日上的大好形势。
    1958年和1959年连续两年大跃进、大丰收的事实，使人们清楚地看到了：全省人民在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的指导和鼓舞下，怎样发扬了人民群众创造历史的无穷无尽的力量和智慧。他们在平凡的劳动中创造了不平凡的奇迹。事实充分证明党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针是完全正确的。在这条总路线的指导下，我国的社会主义建设不但能够高速度、按比例地发展，而且完全可以使这种高速度持续下去。党中央和毛泽东同志早在1949年3月党的七届二中全会上就曾经指出：“中国的经济遗产是落后的，但是中国人民是勇敢而勤劳的，中国人民革命的胜利和人民共和国的建立，中国共产党的领导权，加上世界各国无产阶级的援助，其中主要地是苏联的援助，中国经济建设的速度将不是很慢而可能是相当地快的，中国的兴盛是可以计日程功的。”在第一个五年计划胜利的基础上，两年来黑龙江省和全国连续实现大跃进、大丰收的事实，进一步证明了党中央和毛泽东同志这一预见是完全正确的。我们对于我国社会主义建设事业的光辉灿烂的前景，更加充满了无限的信心、希望和力量。
    黑龙江省是国家第一个五年计划的建设重点之一，在党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导和全国人民的大力支援下，贯彻执行了党的社会主义革命总路线和社会主义建设总路线，经过第一个五年计划期间的建设和1958—1959年连续两年的大跃进，全省经济形势已经发生了巨大而深刻的变化，达到了一个新的发展阶段。黑龙江省已经由一个原来工业基础极为薄弱的、贫穷落后的“北大荒”，变成了国家的一个以重工业为中心、以现代化大型企业为骨干的新的重要工业基地。工业产值在工农业总产值中的比重已达75％左右。现在黑龙江省已经有了相当强大的现代化的机械工业、煤炭工业和森林工业，原来是缺门的钢铁工业也有了很大发展，全省已经形成了以四千公里铁路为中心的包括公路和航运的交通运输网。整个工业已经有了相当雄厚的基础。
    在广大的农村，人民公社已经走上巩固和健全发展的道路，同时还建立了强大的国营农、牧场群和许多副食品基地。农业机械化已有初步基础，机耕面积已达可机耕地的20％以上。由于全面贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”，农业生产抗御自然灾害的能力大大增强。在工业已有可能对农业的技术改造提供更大支援的情况下，农村已经面临着全面地、大规模地推行农业机械化和以粮为纲、农业和工业并举和农、林、牧、副、渔全面大发展的新形势。
    随着生产建设高速度地前进，财贸、政法、科学、教育、文化、卫生等事业也有了巨大发展。人民群众的物质文化生活有了很大的改善，社会主义和共产主义觉悟显著提高，精神面貌发生了深刻变化。
    在党的建设方面，经过社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的丰富斗争的锻炼，党员干部的马克思列宁主义水平有了很大的提高，党的团结空前巩固，党的威信空前提高，各级党组织的领导核心更为坚强，各方面的干部队伍不断壮大，各级党组织和干部积累了丰富的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的经验。以上这些就是黑龙江省社会主义建设新形势的一些主要标志和进入新阶段的主要特征。
    我们共产党人是马克思列宁主义的不断革命论者和革命发展阶段论者。共产党人在领导人民群众的革命斗争中，必须善于科学地分析革命进程各个发展阶段的形势，适时地指明前进的方向，提出新的革命任务，使人民群众的革命与建设事业不致因为满足于既得成就，在中途发生停滞不前的现象。党中央和毛泽东同志，长期以来就是一贯运用这个马克思列宁主义的理论来指导中国的革命和建设的，因而总是使革命不失时机地从
  一个阶段前进到另一个阶段，从一个胜利前进到另一个胜利。在现在黑龙江省的社会主义建设事业已经进入一个新阶段的时候，我们必须根据毛泽东同志的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的思想，自觉地、及时地明确和掌握住这个新的形势，提出新的战斗任务，以便动员和组织全省人民，去争取新的更大的胜利。
    根据黑龙江省社会主义建设发展的新形势，黑龙江省今后的主要任务就是要：继续贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，按照“充分挖掘潜力，大力支援全国，加强全面发展，逐步合理布局”和“依靠党，依靠群众，有中心，有骨干，全面规划，全面跃进”的精神，在中央统一规划下，在继续完成经济、政治、思想战线上的社会主义革命的同时，全面地加速进行技术革命和文化革命，并且以农业为基础，全面地安排国民经济，高速度、按比例地发展生产，力争持续的、全面的大跃进。在农业方面，要加速实现农业现代化；以粮为纲发展多种经营，促进农林牧副渔全面大发展，大力发展以养猪为中心的畜牧业；进一步改变农村的自然面貌。在工业方面，要以钢为纲全面跃进；继续进行技术改造，提高工业的机械化、自动化水平，积极开展各种资源的综合利用，向高、大、精、尖、新的方向发展。同时，积极发展中小型工业，使大中小相结合；积极加强轻工业、交通运输和城市建设及重工业中若干薄弱环节的建设，使工业各部门的发展互相适应，逐步实现工业的合理布局。大力发展与提高科学技术、文化教育事业，建立强大的科学技术队伍和马克思列宁主义的理论队伍，掌握尖端技术，攀登科学高峰。
    所有这些都是为了更好地完成大力支援全国的任务；同时把黑龙江省建设成为更加繁荣、幸福、美丽的地方；并和东北兄弟地区密切配合协作，争取在不长的时间内，把东北地区建成为以重工业为中心，工农业、轻重工业互相适应，大中小结合，布局更为合理，具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化，与全国配合协作而又比较完整的经济体系，以便对国家的社会主义建设作出更多、更大的贡献。在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上，逐步提高人民的物质文化生活水平。黑龙江省1960年的各项工作，都应该按照上述总的目标去进行安排。在这个总的目标之下，1960年黑龙江省将是持续地、全面地大跃进的形势，1960年黑龙江省的工农业总产值将较1959年有更大的增长，工业和农业、轻工业和重工业、粮食和多种经营之间的比例将更互相适应。财政贸易、科学、文化、教育、卫生以及城市建设等事业都将有迅速的发展，人民生活将有进一步的改善。胜利实现1960年的任务，将使黑龙江省的面貌发生进一步的变化，并为今后继续完成新阶段的任务创造更为有利的条件。
    为了实现黑龙江省社会主义建设新阶段和1960年的各项任务，力争持续的全面的大跃进，必须坚决地继续贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针。继续执行政治挂帅和大搞群众运动的方针。继续深入地掀起技术革新运动。
    坚持政治挂帅和大搞群众运动，是充分发扬人民群众的积极性、创造性，从而更好地贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线、高速度发展我国社会主义经济的根本方法。党是一切胜利的领导者和组织者，思想、政治工作是一切工作的灵魂和统帅，群众是历史和一切物质财富与精神财富的创造者。群众中蕴藏着无穷的潜力。他们在党的领导下，不仅依靠自己的力量打破了一个旧世界，解放了自己，而且也完全有力量建设起一个新世界，创造起自己美好的新生活。只要我们加强党的领导，充分发动群众，经常加强党的思想政治
  工作，用马克思列宁主义的思想去教育群众，鼓舞和发扬群众的无穷智慧和积极性、创造性，我们的事业就将无往而不胜。黑龙江省连续两年实现大跃进的实践，在这方面提供了丰富的经验和证明。为了取得今后工作的胜利，我们必须在一切工作中，运用和发扬已有的经验，继续坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。
    我们的事业是艰巨而伟大的，如果没有革命理论的指导，以及对马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的深刻了解，要取得胜利是不可能的。为此，黑龙江省全体干部必须加强对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的学习，不断提高自己的理论素养，并保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，向一切离开党的正确路线的倾向作斗争。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想是指导我们一切工作的理论基础，是革命斗争的行动指针。学习和掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，是取得新阶段建设任务胜利的根本保证。
    在社会主义建设事业突飞猛进的发展中，先进人物、先进经验不断涌现。几年来黑龙江省各地都创造和推广了不少的先进经验，如企业管理方面的“两参一改三结合”、工业生产方面的“积木式机床”、“自动化生产线”、“简化升压环形供电”、“生产运动会”；基建方面的“新技术试验大楼”等，以及在农业、财贸、科学文教等方面的不少先进经验，都对社会主义建设起了有力的推动作用。先进人物和先进经验对社会生产的发展有极大的促进作用，在今后的建设事业中，先进经验必然还会层出不穷，把先进经验迅速普及为全社会的经验，社会生产水平就会不断地提高，社会主义建设就会加速进行。因此我们应该十分重视、鼓励和发扬群众的创造性，支持一切能够推动生产和工作前进的创举和新生事物，抓紧对先进经验的总结和推广工作。我们还要继续学习苏联和其它社会主义国家以及国内各兄弟地区的先进经验，以加快我们的社会主义建设。
    党的团结是团结全体人民进行社会主义建设的最基本的条件。只要全党全民团结一致，同心同德，我们的力量就会是无穷无尽的，一切事业就有了胜利的根本保证。为实现新阶段的伟大的建设任务，全省党组织和人民必须更加紧密地团结起来，团结在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的旗帜之下，团结在党中央、毛泽东同志的周围，团结在党的社会主义建设总路线的周围、团结在各级党组织及其领导核心的周围。这样我们的事业就一定会不断地取得新的、更大的成就。
    现在我国在经历着历史上伟大的飞跃的时代，形势极为良好。在国际上，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量不断壮大，团结继续增强，反对帝国主义、殖民主义的民族独立运动和全世界爱好和平的力量也在继续发展壮大。帝国主义者不论他披着什么外衣，都不可能掩尽天下耳目，也不可能克服它的重重矛盾和摆脱日暮途穷的境遇。国际政治中的根本形势是东风压倒西风。在国内，整个形势更是一片光明，总路线、大跃进、人民公社的旗帜越举越高，1959年的生产和基本建设计划都已提前超额完成，到处都呈现着欣欣向荣的极为活跃的局面。我们的国家是一片兴旺昌盛的气象。任何力量也阻挡不了我们在社会主义建设大跃进的道路上飞奔前进。我们过去已经取得极其伟大的成就，今后还要取得新的、更大的成就。我们进行的革命是没有止境的。我们的前途是极其光明的。我们的事业是十分伟大的。我们要有共产主义的远大理想和雄心大志，自觉地担负起改造旧世界、建设新世界的重任。共产党人的一生就是不断学习、不断奋斗和不断发展和进步的一生。我们要永远保持青春的活力，永远作革命的促进派。在我们前进的道路上，尽管还会遇到这样那样的困难，但是没有任何困难不能被我们克服。新时期社会主义建设的重大任务一定能够胜利实现。
    让我们在党中央、毛泽东同志的英明领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，更紧密地团结起来，斗志昂扬地、谦虚谨慎地努力奋斗，为把我们的国家建设成具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国。为把黑龙江省建设成为更加繁荣、幸福、美丽的地方奋勇前进。
