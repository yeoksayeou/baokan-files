    Conducting Scientific Research at High Speed in Universities
    Su Buqing, Vice President of Fudan University
    To fully mobilize the enthusiasm of universities in scientific research, to conduct scientific research work in a faster, better, and more economical way, and to better serve socialist construction is a glorious task that our universities must undertake while completing their teaching missions.
    Why should universities conduct scientific research? There can be various answers to this question. In my opinion, the most fundamental thing is to look at the issue from the requirements of socialist construction.
    China's rapidly developing socialist construction, which is changing with each passing day, has raised a large number of questions for scientific research in various fields, which urgently need to be solved. Because universities have batches of experts and a large number of mass scientific teams, a complete set of professional settings, and relatively substantial library resources and experimental equipment, they have the responsibility to undertake research tasks together with the Academy of Sciences and the research institutions of various business departments to develop the country's scientific undertakings. At the same time, we know that the occurrence and development of science come from the practice of the struggle for production and class struggle. Therefore, scientific research work in universities must also be closely integrated with reality, and cannot be divorced from reality. Even taking mathematics, which is relatively abstract, as an example, this is the case. The development of new branches in modern mathematics is related to major new developments in production and new achievements in modern technology. Senior students of the Mathematics Department of Fudan University regularly participate in productive labor in business departments and production units according to the provisions of the education plan, and assist in solving mathematical problems in production. This not only improves their thinking and consolidates their theoretical knowledge, but also broadens their horizons, which is conducive to learning new subjects in mathematics. This is a concrete illustration. The development of science and the improvement of scientific levels can only be effectively realized in the process of close contact with reality. This is one aspect.
    On the other hand, the rapid development of socialist construction not only puts forward the requirement of cultivating a large number of cadres, with an increasing number, to universities, but also puts forward increasingly high requirements on the quality of cadres cultivated. This requires universities to continuously improve the quality of teaching, and to take improving the quality of teaching as a regular and fundamental task. And carrying out scientific research has a very important significance for improving the quality of teaching, so we must closely combine the scientific research work in schools with the task of improving the quality of teaching. In order to improve the quality of teaching, from the perspective of teachers, it is necessary to continuously improve their political and ideological level and scientific level, and to master the laws of teaching work. The teacher's scientific level in teaching is mainly reflected in two aspects: one is to explain the content of the course thoroughly according to the requirements of the education plan, and to reflect the spirit of combining theory with practice; the other is to teach students the latest scientific achievements, not only to enable students to firmly grasp the basic theoretical knowledge, but also to enable students to touch the pulse of the latest development of this discipline. All of this also requires teachers to actively carry out scientific research. Without carrying out scientific research, teachers cannot master the latest scientific achievements and practical knowledge, and it is impossible to impart the laws of change and development of objective things studied by this discipline to students in an orderly manner. From the perspective of students, carrying out scientific research has important significance for improving the quality of learning. The reason why the quality of students' learning has improved significantly in the past two years is fundamentally because the party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor has been implemented, and the combination of teaching, scientific research, and productive labor has been realized. Students, especially senior students, participate in scientific research. The main purpose of students participating in scientific research is to improve the quality of learning. The result of doing so is of great benefit to students in deeply mastering the theoretical knowledge they have learned, improving their ability to work independently, developing a style of combining theory with practice, consolidating professional thinking, learning scientific research methods, and establishing the idea of scientific research serving socialist construction. The most prominent point is that reading has become more extensive and the ability to work has improved. In order to solve the problems studied, the purpose of reading is stronger, the research is deeper, and the scope of reading is broader. Through scientific research, students' hands-on ability has been greatly strengthened, whether it is writing, calculation, or experimental operation, all of which are true, and this is precisely the weak link in the past. Liberal arts students have come into contact with reality, mastered a large amount of original materials, promoted the study of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong's works, and the party's policies and guidelines, and cultivated the ability to conduct independent research and writing through participating in investigation and research, academic discussions, and textbook compilation work. Science students carry out the construction work of specialized laboratories under the guidance of teachers. Through designing, manufacturing, adjusting, and using instruments by themselves, and carrying out research on modern science and technology, they have played a significant role in deeply mastering the theoretical knowledge they have learned and improving their independent working ability. In this way, teaching and learning themselves become a kind of creative labor, and the enthusiasm and potential of teachers and students in teaching and learning are further developed.
    Whether universities can carry out scientific research at high speed is a matter of debate in universities. I think the key to the problem lies in the leadership of the party, adhering to the mass line, and launching a large-scale mass movement. Judging from the experience of the past two years, as long as we adhere to the mass line of combining experts and the masses under the leadership of the party, and launch a large-scale mass movement, the school's scientific research work will definitely develop at a high speed. Taking Fudan University as an example, due to breaking superstitions, liberating thinking, and widely mobilizing teachers and students, from June 1958 to the National Day of 1959, a total of three thousand six hundred and nineteen scientific research projects were carried out, of which five hundred and twenty-six were relatively important. In particular, after implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, on the basis of opposing right-leaning and boosting morale, there are currently more than five hundred research projects being actively carried out. The quality of research has also continued to improve, academic discussions have been conducted extensively, and the appraisal of research results has been tightened. Due to the development of scientific research work, the construction of new courses and new laboratories has also developed relatively rapidly. Through implementing the mass line and launching a large-scale mass movement, the masses can be mobilized to play a collective role under the guidance of the correct direction, to divide labor and cooperate to undertake research tasks, and to mobilize the masses to concentrate on working and tackling key problems during a certain period on the basis of regular, in-depth and detailed research work. In this way, research work can be developed rapidly, and the enthusiasm of experts and the masses can be fully utilized. The result of doing so is of great benefit to adhering to politics in command in scientific research work, establishing ambitious goals, organizing and training teams, and carrying out communist collaboration. These are advantages that were not possible when one or a few people were working in a room in a cold and quiet manner in the past.
    Some people do not see the problem in this way. They do not trust the power of the masses. They believe that, in order to truly and quickly master the highest peak of modern science, this is not possible. We must rely on the work of a small number of experts over the years, and we must start from mastering the achievements that others have already made. On this issue, we not only do not neglect the role of experts, but also attach great importance to giving full play to the role of experts; however, we believe that experts must combine with the masses under the leadership of the party, and only in this way can the role of experts be better exerted. Similarly, we not only do not neglect all existing scientific achievements, but also attach great importance to seriously studying and mastering these achievements; however, we do not blindly believe in authority, and in the face of the peak of science, we must adopt the method of catching up and developing as soon as possible. As long as we fully mobilize the masses, give full play to the wisdom and talents of the masses, and combine experts and the masses, this is entirely possible. This is an important experience we have had in the past two years. The formation of new schools of thought in science is the result of carrying out huge creative work. The so-called school of thought is a system and method formed on the basis of correctly studying and explaining the objective laws of things, which of course cannot be formed by following the work of others step by step.
    Some people doubt whether implementing the mass line can guarantee high quality. First of all, we must fully recognize and estimate these large numbers of achievements in linking theory with practice and developing new science and technology in the past two years. This is a phenomenon that has never happened before. It is precisely because of these achievements that we have laid an ideological and work foundation for further progress. Secondly, we must also look at what kind of people and how long it took to achieve most of these achievements. For many young people who were completely unfamiliar with certain subjects one or two years ago, they have now made achievements, established equipment, carried out adjustments, carried out work, and written papers after their hard work under the leadership of the Party. Is this not the best explanation that it has a certain quality? The Probability Theory Teaching and Research Group of Fudan University is a newly established teaching and research group in 1958. The members are all young people, and they basically have not taken courses in this area in the past. After a year of hard work, they have now opened a "Probability Theory" major course, established two special discussion classes on probability theory and mathematical statistics, and written more than ten papers, some of which have been published in scientific records. This is just one of many examples that every school has. The new forces have unlimited prospects, and their estimates must have a developmental perspective. At the same time, we also realize that quality does not come out of thin air, but is produced through a lot of work. Quality is produced in quantity, and cutting-edge technology is produced in the masses. This is exactly the case.
    Some people say that there is a contradiction in time arrangement when engaging in large-scale scientific research. In fact, from a fundamental point of view, teaching and scientific research are closely linked and complement each other. To truly and conscientiously improve the quality of teaching and the level of teachers, it is necessary to carry out scientific research. For teachers, this is not an additional task, but their own responsibility. Of course, in terms of requirements, it can be different according to individual circumstances. As long as there is a correct understanding and proper arrangement, teaching and scientific research can be completely combined. There has been a lot of experience in this area in the past year. The large amount of research work we have recently done has not stopped for a day, not only has it not affected the quality of teaching, but it has also played a role in promoting the improvement of the quality of teaching. In terms of topic selection, while we are implementing the service for socialist construction, we closely combine a large number of research work with the requirements of improving the quality of teaching according to the characteristics of the school, so that scientific research work can be carried out in depth and persistently, and the quality of special research can be gradually improved on this basis.
    The recently convened Central Higher Education Scientific Research Work Conference gave us great education in political thought and theory, making us more clear about a series of issues such as the situation, direction, policies, tasks and organizational leadership of carrying out scientific research in universities, and making us more energetic. We are fully confident, ambitious, determined, energetic, and climbing the peak. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, we will push the school's scientific research work to a higher stage.

    高速度地开展高等学校的科学研究
    复旦大学副校长　苏步青
    充分地发挥高等学校科学研究的积极性，多快好省地开展科学研究工作，更好地为社会主义建设服务，这是我们高等学校在完成教学任务的同时所必须承担的一项光荣的任务。
    高等学校为什么要开展科学研究？这个问题可以有各种不同的回答。我看，最根本的是要从社会主义建设的要求上来看问题。
    我国日新月异、迅速发展着的社会主义建设事业，对各方面的科学研究提出了大量的问题，迫切地需要加以解决。由于高等学校有着成批的专家和数量庞大的群众性科学队伍，整套的专业设置，较为充实的图书资料和实验设备，因此，有责任和科学院、各业务部门研究机构一起，承担研究任务，发展国家的科学事业。同时，我们知道，科学的发生和发展，是来自生产斗争和阶级斗争的实践的。因此，高等学校的科学研究工作同样必须密切结合实际，而不能脱离实际。即便拿抽象性比较强的数学来看，也是如此。现代数学中新的分支的发展，都是和生产上重大的新发展、现代技术的新成就相联系的。复旦大学数学系的高年级学生根据教育计划的规定，定期到业务部门、生产单位参加生产劳动和协助解决生产中的数学问题，不仅提高了思想、巩固了所学的理论知识，而且开阔了眼界，有助于数学上新的学科的学习，就是一个具体的说明。科学的发展，科学水平的提高，也只有在紧密联系实际的过程中，才能有力的实现。这是一方面。
    另一方面。社会主义建设的迅速发展，对高等学校不仅提出了培养大量的、数量愈来愈多的干部的要求，而且在培养干部的质量上也提出了愈来愈高的要求。这就要求高等学校不断地提高教学质量，把提高教学质量作为一个经常的基本任务。而开展科学研究，对提高教学质量又有着十分重大的意义，因此必须把学校中的科学研究工作同提高教学质量的任务紧密地结合起来。为了提高教学质量，从教师方面讲，要不断地提高政治思想水平与科学水平，掌握教学工作的规律。教师的科学水平在教学中的反映主要有两个方面：一个是根据教育计划的要求把课程的内容讲透，体现理论联系实际的精神；一个是教给学生最新的科学成就，不仅要使学生牢固地掌握基础的理论知识，而且要使学生摸到这门学科最近发展的脉搏。这一切也都要求教师积极地开展科学研究。不开展科学研究，教师就不可能掌握最新的科学成就和实际的知识，这也就不可能把这门学科所研究的客观事物的变化发展的规律有条有理地传授给学生。从学生方面讲，开展科学研究对提高学习质量有着重要的意义。这两年来学生的学习质量有比较显著提高的原因，最根本的就是贯彻了党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，实现了教学、科学研究和生产劳动的三结合。学生、特别是高年级学生参加了科学研究。学生参加科学研究的主要目的是为了提高学习质量。这样做的结果，对学生深入掌握所学的理论知识、提高独立工作能力、养成理论联系实际的学风、巩固专业思想、学习科学研究的方法和树立科学研究为社会主义建设服务的思想等方面，都有很大的好处。其中最突出的一点，是使得书读得多了读得活了，工作能力提高了。为了解决所研究的问题，读书的目的性更强了，钻研得更深了，阅读的范围更广阔了。通过科学研究，学生动手的能力大为加强，不论是写作、运算或实验操作，都是如此，而这一点，也正是过去的薄弱环节。文科学生通过参加调查研究、学术讨论和教材编写工作，接触了实际，掌握了大量原始材料，推动了马克思列宁主义毛泽东著作和党的方针政策的学习，培养了独立钻研和写作的能力。理科学生在教师指导下进行专门实验室的建设工作，通过自己动手设计、制造、调整、使用仪器，开展现代科学技术的研究，对深入掌握所学理论知识、提高独立工作能力起了显著的作用。这样，教和学本身都成为一种创造性的劳动，教师和学生在教和学中的干劲和潜力就进一步发挥出来了。
    高等学校能不能高速度地开展科学研究，在高等学校里是有争论的。我看问题的关键在于党的领导，坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动。从两年来的经验看来，只要我们在党的领导下坚持专家和群众相结合的群众路线，大搞群众运动，学校的科学研究工作就一定能够高速度地发展。以复旦大学为例，由于破除迷信、解放思想，广泛地发动了师生群众，从1958年6月到1959年国庆节，共进行了三千六百一十九项科学研究工作，其中完成的较重要的项目有五百二十六项。特别是贯彻了党的八届八中全会决议精神，在反右倾、鼓干劲的基础上，目前正在积极进行的研究工作还有五百多项。研究的质量也继续得到了提高，学术讨论广泛地进行，研究成果的鉴定工作也抓得更紧了。由于科学研究工作的开展，新课程和新实验室的建设工作也有了较为迅速的发展。通过贯彻群众路线和大搞群众运动，就可以发动群众在正确的方向指导下发挥集体力量、分工合作地来担任研究任务，在经常地、深入细致地研究工作的基础上在一定时期发动群众集中地进行工作和攻坚。这样，研究工作就能得到迅速的发展，专家和群众的积极性也能得到充分的发挥。这样做的结果，对于科学研究工作中坚持政治挂帅，树立雄心大志，组织训练队伍和开展共产主义协作，都有很大的好处，这些都是过去一个人或几个人在房间里冷冷清清地搞所不可能具有的优点。
    有些人却不是这样看问题。他们不信任群众的力量。他们认为，要真正迅速地掌握现代科学的最高峰，这样是不行的，还得依靠少数专家长年累月的工作，还得从掌握人家已有的成就做起。在这个问题上，我们不仅毫不忽视专家的作用，而且十分重视发挥专家的作用；但是我们认为专家必须在党的领导下和群众相结合，只有这样，才能更好地发挥专家的作用。同样，我们不仅毫不忽视一切已有的科学成就，而且十分重视认真地去学习和掌握这些成就；但是，我们不迷信权威，在科学高峰面前，我们要采取迎头赶上、尽快发展的办法。只要我们充分地发动群众，发挥群众的聪明才智，把专家和群众结合起来，这是完全可能实现的。这是我们两年来的一条重要经验。科学上新的学派的形成，是进行巨大的创造性工作的结果。所谓学派是在正确地研究和阐明事物的客观规律上形成了一套体系和方法，这当然不是跟在人家的工作后面亦步亦趋所能形成的。
    有人怀疑贯彻群众路线能否保证较高的质量。首先，我们要充分地认识和估计两年来在理论联系实际和发展新的科学技术上的这些大量的成果，这是过去从来没有过的现象，正是因为这些成果，使我们在进一步前进中打下了思想上和工作上的基础。其次，还要看一下，这些成果中的绝大部分是些怎么样的人在多久的时间里取得的。对于许多青年在一、两年前还是完全陌生的学科，在党的领导下经过他们刻苦的研究，现在做出了成果，建立了设备，进行了调整，开展了工作，写出了论文，这难道不是具有一定质量的最好的说明吗。复旦大学概率论教研组是1958年新成立的一个教研组，成员都是青年，他们过去基本上都没有学过这方面的课程，经过一年来的努力，现在已经开出“概率论”专业课，建立了概率论、数理统计两个专题讨论班，写出了十多篇论文，有的已在科学纪录上发表。这不过是各个学校都有的许多例子中的一个。新生力量是前途无量的，对他们的估计必须具有发展观点。同时，我们还认识到，质量不是凭空而降，是通过大量的工作中产生的。在数量中产生质量，在群众中产生尖端，事实正是如此。
    有人讲，大搞科学研究，在时间安排上有矛盾。其实，从根本上来看，教学和科学研究是密切结合、相辅相成的。要切实认真地提高教学质量和师资水平，必须开展科学研究。对教师讲，这不是外加的任务，而是本身的职责。当然，在要求上，是可以根据个人的具体情况而有所不同。只要有正确的认识和妥善的安排，教学和科学研究是完全可以结合的。一年来这方面已经有许多经验。我们最近搞的大量研究工作，就没有停过一天课，不仅没有影响教学质量，而且对提高教学质量起了促进作用。在选题上，我们在贯彻为社会主义建设服务的同时，根据学校的特点使大量的研究工作和提高教学质量的要求密切结合起来，这样就能使科学研究工作深入、持久地进行，并在这个基础上逐步提高专题研究的质量。
    最近中央召开的高等学校科学研究工作会议，在政治思想上和理论上给了我们很大的教育，使我们对高等学校开展科学研究的形势、方向、方针任务和组织领导等一系列问题更加明确了，干劲更充沛了，我们完全有充分的信心，立大志、下决心、鼓干劲、登高峰，在党委的领导下把学校的科学研究工作推到一个更高的阶段。
