To seize the full year's harvest, first focus on high wheat yields.
Tang County promotes the "Ten To The Fields For High Yield" method to strengthen wheat field management.
The specific contents of the "Ten To The Fields For High Yield" are: political and ideological work to the fields, cadre leadership to the fields, hand-in-hand competition to the fields, pig raising and manure accumulation to the fields, technical guidance to the fields, scientific research to the fields, meteorological work to the fields, fixed labor force to the fields, tool repair to the fields, and cultural and recreational work to the fields.

According to the Hebei Daily, as the movement for high wheat yield hand-in-hand competition deepens, the Tang County Party Committee calls on all communes to universally adopt the revolutionary measure of "Ten To The Fields" to vigorously grasp wheat field management, resolutely launch the first shot for the continued leap forward in agriculture, and seize the great summer harvest of 1960.

The Tang County Party Committee, in formulating the plan for the high-speed development of agricultural production in 1960, recognized that learning from An’guo County's experience, deeply carrying out the wheat yield surpassing hand-in-hand competition, and winning the great summer harvest of 1960 were important keys to ensuring the high-speed leap forward in agriculture throughout the year. When formulating measures for wheat management, they analyzed a series of new changes since the people's communes were established. That is, the county's more than 290,000 mu of wheat had implemented contiguous and combined fields, improved soil, and complete water conservancy projects before and after sowing. Furthermore, with the change of the farming system, it provided extremely favorable conditions for the comprehensive utilization of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. It was decided to turn all wheat fields into high-yield fields, and based on the experience of the Xiaoxidi wheat high-yield field, the revolutionary measure of "Ten To The Fields" was adopted. The specific contents of the "Ten To The Fields" are: (1) Political and ideological education to the fields. According to the number of people in each high-yield field professional team, a certain number of leading cadres are assigned to be responsible for organizing everyone to study the Party's line and policies and to conduct socialist and communist education. (2) Cadre leadership to the fields. Each field organizes a production guidance committee, with secretaries at all levels responsible for each field, participating in production and leading production. Currently, Wei Qinghai, Secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat, and more than 600 secretaries and cadres from various communes, management districts, and production teams have gone deep into various wheat high-yield fields, and will be responsible for them until the summer harvest. (3) Hand-in-hand competition to the fields. In the process of managing wheat fields, hand-in-hand competitions are widely carried out between fields, between teams, and between people, and evaluations and inspections are carried out according to the production season, setting up models and promoting the continuous upsurge of the hand-in-hand competition movement. (4) Pig raising and manure accumulation to the fields. At present, more than 200 pig farms have been built in the wheat high-yield fields throughout the county. In order to meet the needs of large-scale fertilization in the fields, breeders have universally promoted the method of contracting pigs, contracting pens, and determining fertilizer by pigs. Now, an average of 40 pigs are fixed with one cart, and 10 pigs in the mountainous area are fixed with one pack animal to ensure timely transportation of soil and manure. (5) Technical guidance to the fields. Technical guidance stations are established in fields of more than 10,000 mu, and technical guidance groups are established in fields of less than 10,000 mu, with an average of one technician for every 100 mu. The method of "three combinations" of cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians is adopted to continuously improve the technology of wheat field management. (6) Scientific research to the fields. In order to popularize and improve agricultural technology, scientific research institutes are established in fields of more than 10,000 mu, scientific research stations are established in fields of 1,000 mu, and crop research groups are established in fields of 100 mu. At present, key experiments are being carried out in the fields in order to create experience and guide the overall situation. At the same time, it is also necessary to conduct a general survey of the soil and provide technical guidance according to the various stages of wheat growth, such as greening, jointing, heading, and filling. (7) Meteorological work to the fields. Meteorology should take the field as its base, so that every field establishes a meteorological post, and every 1,000 mu field establishes a meteorological group, so that the county forms an agricultural meteorological network. (8) Fixed labor force to the fields, strengthen the production responsibility system. At present, more than 30,000 laborers have been fixed throughout the county, forming 2,100 wheat field professional teams, dividing management areas, and dividing labor for management. (9) Tool repair to the fields. Repair and distribution stations are established in high-yield fields of more than 10,000 mu, and a regular patrol repair method is implemented in high-yield fields of less than 10,000 mu. Before watering the wheat to green up in early February, a major repair of irrigation machinery should be organized to ensure that the drainage and irrigation machinery does not malfunction and to improve the utilization rate. (10) Cultural and recreational work to the fields. Closely combining production and seizing the gaps in production, organize commune members to carry out various forms of cultural and recreational activities such as literacy, reading newspapers, reading books, singing, and poetry recitation in the high-yield fields, in order to enliven the cultural life of the commune members.

Under the encouragement of the revolutionary measure of "Ten To The Fields," the vast number of cadres and commune members have pushed the wheat yield surpassing hand-in-hand competition movement to a new climax since 1960. The various professional teams in the wheat high-yield fields of the Beiluo Commune are chasing each other and moving forward hand in hand. The Baisha team launched a hand-in-hand competition with the Diaoyutai team, taking the early realization of the "Three Universals" (universal plowing, universal rolling, and universal green manure covering) as a condition. All the commune members of the team worked hard for two and a half days and covered 1,700 mu of wheat with green fertilizer, and plowed and rolled it once universally. The commune members of the Diaoyutai team worked even harder and completed the task of topdressing, plowing, and rolling 630 mu of wheat fields in three days. At present, more than 270,000 mu of wheat fields throughout the county have realized the "Three Universals" to ensure that the wheat safely overwinter. (Attached picture)

The Nanchong Special Zone in Sichuan Province has undergone a small spring field management campaign to catch up with high-yield fields from general fields, and the small spring crops are generally growing well. This is the wheat field of the Wufeng People's Commune in Nanchong City, with each field surpassing the other.

    夺取全年丰收先抓小麦高产
    唐县推行“十到丰产方”加强麦田管理
    “十到丰产方”的具体内容是：政治思想工作到方，干部领导到方，携手竞赛到方，养猪积肥到方，技术指导到方，科学研究到方，气象工作到方，劳力固定到方，工具修理到方，文娱工作到方。
    据河北日报消息  中共唐县县委随着小麦超产携手赛运动的深入开展，号召各公社普遍采取“十到方”的革命措施，狠抓麦田管理，坚决打响农业继续跃进的头一炮，夺取1960年夏季大丰收。
    中共唐县县委早在制订1960年高速度发展农业生产的规划时，认识到学习安国县的经验，深入开展小麦超产携手赛，夺得1960年夏季大丰收，是保证全年农业高速度跃进的重要关键。在制订小麦管理的措施时，分析了人民公社化以来一系列的新变化，这就是全县的二十九万多亩小麦，在播种前后实行了连片并方、改良土壤、水利工程配套，并且随着耕作制度的改变，给综合利用农业“八字宪法”，提供了极为有利的条件，决定全部麦田搞成丰产方，并根据小西堤小麦丰产方的经验，采取了“十到方”的革命措施。“十到方”的具体内容是：（一）政治思想教育到方。按各个丰产方专业队人数的多少，配备一定的领导骨干，负责组织大家学习党的路线和方针政策，进行社会主义和共产主义教育。（二）干部领导到方。方方组织生产指导委员会，层层书记包方，参加生产领导生产。现在县委书记处书记魏清海以及各公社、管理区、生产队的书记和干部共六百多人，已深入到各个麦田丰产方，一直包到夏收为止。（三）携手竞赛到方。在管理麦田的过程中，方与方之间、队与队之间、人与人之间普遍展开了携手赛，并按生产季节进行评比检查，广树标兵，推动携手竞赛运动不断高涨。（四）养猪积肥到方。目前全县已在麦田丰产方里建成二百多个养猪场。为满足方田大量施肥的需要，饲养人员普遍推行了包猪、包圈和以猪定肥的办法。现在，平均四十口猪固定了一辆车，山区十口猪固定了一个驮，保证及时运土和送粪。（五）技术指导到方。万亩以上的方建立技术指导站，万亩以下的方建立技术指导组，平均每百亩设一名技术员。并采取干部、老农和技术员“三结合”的方法，不断提高麦田管理的技术。（六）科学研究到方。为了普及和提高农业技术，万亩以上方建立科学研究所，千亩方设科学研究站，百亩方设作物研究组。目前，正在方田里作重点试验，以便创造经验，指导全面。同时，还要普查土壤，按照小麦生长的返青、拔节、抽穗、灌浆等各个阶段进行技术指导。（七）气象工作到方。气象要以方为阵地，达到方方建立气象哨，千亩方建立气象组，使全县形成农业气象网。（八）劳力固定到方，加强生产责任制。目前，全县已固定了三万多名劳动力，组成了二千一百个麦田专业队，划分管理区域，分工进行管理。（九）工具修理到方。万亩以上丰产方建立修配站，万亩以下的丰产方实行定期巡回到方检修办法。2月上旬浇小麦返青水以前，要组织一次灌溉机械大修理，保证排灌机械不出故障，提高使用率。（十）文化娱乐工作到方。紧密结合生产和抓生产空隙，组织社员在丰产方里开展识字、读报、看书和歌唱、诗朗诵等不同形式的文化娱乐活动，以活跃社员的文化生活。
    广大干部社员，在“十到方”这一革命措施的鼓舞下，从1960年开始，就把小麦超产携手赛运动推向新高潮。北罗公社麦田丰产方的各个专业队你追我赶，携手前进。白沙队以提前实现“三普”（普耙、普轧、普蒙青）为条件，和钓鱼台队展开携手赛，全队社员大干两天半，就把一千七百亩小麦都蒙了青肥，普遍耙、轧了一遍，钓鱼台队的社员们干劲更大，三天完成了六百三十亩麦田的追肥和耙轧任务。田目前，全县已有二十七万多亩麦田实现了“三普”，以保证小麦安全越冬。（附图片）
