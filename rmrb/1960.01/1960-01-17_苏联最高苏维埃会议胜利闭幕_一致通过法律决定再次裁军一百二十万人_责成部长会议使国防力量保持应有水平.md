Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th: The fourth session of the fifth convocation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union concluded victoriously in Moscow at 6:00 PM on the 15th. The meeting unanimously passed the law on further substantial reduction of the Soviet armed forces and the appeal from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries in the world.

    Before passing these documents, the afternoon session on the 15th continued to discuss the report of Nikita Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. Those who spoke included Krylov, representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and director of the Likhachev Automobile Factory in Moscow; Zakharov, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany; and Pavlov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League. Marshal Zakharov said in his speech that the Soviet government's proposal to further reduce the Soviet armed forces is a sign of the continuous growth of the power of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp. He assured the meeting that the Soviet forces in Germany are at all times in a state of combat readiness, gloriously and worthily taking on their guard duties abroad.

    Suslov, representative of the Supreme Soviet and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Union Council, spoke at the meeting.

    Suslov said that the Soviet Union's renewed reduction of armed forces is the result of the Soviet Union's economic development and scientific and technological advancement, and the further strengthening of the Soviet society's unprecedented spiritual and political unity and the power of the socialist family of nations. This new peaceful step by the Soviet Union deals another fatal blow to all enemies of détente and all those keen on the arms race and war.

    Suslov then, on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Union Council and the National Council of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, submitted the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries for adoption. He read the draft of this appeal to the meeting.

    Subsequently, Nikita Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, spoke. He pointed out that all the representatives who spoke at the meeting supported his report and the draft law on reducing the Soviet armed forces. Khrushchev, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, expressed his gratitude to the representatives for their trust in the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, and called on the representatives to approve the draft law on reducing the armed forces.

    Afterwards, the Union Council and the National Council voted separately and unanimously passed the law on further substantial reduction of the Soviet armed forces.

    The law states that, in order to make a new contribution to safeguarding peace and creating extremely favorable conditions for reaching an agreement on complete and thorough disarmament, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has decided to further substantially reduce the Soviet armed forces by 1.2 million people. To this end, the law stipulates the disbandment of a considerable number of units and military schools of the Soviet Army and Navy, the corresponding reduction of armaments, and the reduction of expenditures for military needs in the Soviet national budget.

    The law entrusts the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union with determining the specific timeline for reducing the Soviet armed forces and ensuring that retired armed forces personnel obtain work in the national economic sectors. The law also entrusts the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union with maintaining the Soviet Union's defense capabilities at the original level, retaining the necessary Soviet armed forces and armaments, until an international agreement on complete and thorough disarmament is reached.

    The meeting also unanimously passed the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries in the world. The appeal expresses the hope that the Soviet Union's renewed unilateral reduction of armed forces will become an example for other countries, especially those with enormous military strength.

    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union calls on the parliaments and governments of all countries to respond to the Soviet Union's new peace initiative.

    The meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union concluded its work at this point.

    苏联最高苏维埃会议胜利闭幕
    一致通过法律决定再次裁军一百二十万人
    责成部长会议使国防力量保持应有水平
    据新华社莫斯科15日电　第五届苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议，15日下午六时在莫斯科闭幕。会议一致通过了关于苏联再一次大量裁减武装部队的法律和苏联最高苏维埃致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书。
    在通过这些文件以前，15日下午会议继续对苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的报告进行了讨论。发言的有苏联最高苏维埃代表、莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车工厂厂长克雷洛夫、驻德苏军总司令扎哈罗夫、列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会书记巴夫洛夫等人。扎哈罗夫元帅在发言时说，苏联政府提出再一次裁减苏联武装部队，这是苏联和整个社会主义阵营威力不断增长的标志。他向会议保证，驻德苏军随时随刻地处于战斗准备状态，光荣无愧地担当起它在国外的守卫岗位。
    最高苏维埃代表、联盟院外交委员会主席苏斯洛夫在会上发言。
    苏斯洛夫说，苏联再次裁减武装部队是苏联经济发展和科学技术发达的结果，是苏维埃社会在精神上和政治上，空前团结以及社会主义国家大家庭的威力进一步加强的结果。苏联这一新的和平步骤给了缓和国际紧张局势的一切敌人以及一切热中于军备竞赛和战争的人又一个致命的打击。
    苏斯洛夫接着代表苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院外交委员会把苏联最高苏维埃致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书提交会议通过。他向会议宣读了这个呼吁书的草案。
    接着，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫讲了话。他指出，所有在会上发言的代表都支持他的报告和关于裁减苏联武装部队法草案。赫鲁晓夫代表苏共中央和苏联部长会议对代表们给予苏共中央苏联政府的信任表示感谢，并且号召代表们批准裁减武装部队法草案。
    随后，联盟院和民族院分别表决并一致通过了关于苏联再一次大量裁减武装部队的法律。
    这项法律说，苏联最高苏维埃为了在保障和平和给达成全面彻底裁军的协定创造极良好的条件方面作出新的贡献，特决定再一次大量裁减苏联武装部队一百二十万人。为此，法律规定解散苏联陆海军的相当数目的部队和军事学校，相应地裁减军备并减少苏联国家预算中用于军事需要的开支。
    法律责成苏联部长会议确定裁减苏联武装部队的具体期限，并保证使退伍的武装部队人员在国民经济部门中获得工作。法案还责成苏联部长会议使苏联的国防力量保持在原有的水平上，保留必要的苏联武装部队和军备，直到达成全面彻底裁军的国际协定为止。
    会议最后还一致通过了苏联最高苏维埃致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书。呼吁书希望，苏联再次单方面裁减武装部队将成为其他国家、特别是拥有巨大军事力量的那些国家的榜样。
    苏联最高苏维埃呼吁各国议会和政府响应苏联的新的和平倡议。
    苏联最高苏维埃会议至此结束了它的工作。
