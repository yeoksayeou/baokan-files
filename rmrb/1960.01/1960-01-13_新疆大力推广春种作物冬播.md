An Important Reform in Agricultural Cropping Systems
    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, January 12th. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has begun a major reform in its cropping system: winter sowing crops have increased from the past spring wheat to include rapeseed, flax, highland barley, peas, safflower, and other six kinds. Winter sowing areas have spread throughout the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Hami Special District, Yanqi Basin, and most counties in the Kashgar River and Yarkand River basins in southern Xinjiang. Last winter, the region's winter sowing area reached more than 1.4 million mu, more than ten times larger than the previous year. In addition, more than 40,000 mu of spring vegetables were winter sown.
    After spring crops are winter sown, the seeds overwinter in the ground and germinate and grow in the spring of the following year. This is a bold innovation in Xinjiang's agricultural production. This innovation was implemented on the basis of experiments. Trials in various parts of the Autonomous Region over the past few years have proved that winter-sown crops mature about half a month earlier than spring-sown crops, and yields are also higher. Generally, winter-sown spring wheat increases production by 15% to 20%, flax increases by 15% to 22%, and rapeseed increases by 42% to 60%. Because after winter sowing, crop seeds are preparing for development all winter and have been tested by various harsh natural conditions, they are more robust, stronger, and cold-resistant when they grow out in the spring, and the quality of the seeds is greatly improved.
    The Yanqi Reclamation Area Agricultural Science Research Institute of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps used the seeds harvested from winter-sown spring wheat in the first year and then conducted winter sowing or spring sowing, both of which increased production by 8% to 16% compared with the original spring wheat seeds. Seeds that have been winter-sown for two consecutive years have an average increase in production of 40%. Measurements of growth conditions have proved that the number of secondary roots, root weight, plant height, spike weight, and grain weight of winter-sown seeds are significantly increased compared with spring-sown seeds. Their conclusion is that winter sowing is also a good way to rejuvenate seeds.
    Winter sowing of spring crops results in strong root development, which penetrates the soil three to fourteen centimeters deeper than spring-sown crops, thus greatly improving drought resistance, disease resistance, and lodging resistance. When the CPC Yiwu County Committee summarized the experience of winter sowing spring wheat in 1956 and 1957, it found that rust-affected leaves accounted for 70% to 80% of spring-sown spring wheat, while rust-affected leaves accounted for only 10% to 20% of winter-sown spring wheat. A survey by a state-owned farm in Yanqi proved that the general incidence of spring-sown spring wheat with black smut reached 6.8%, with the highest reaching 10.8%, while winter-sown spring wheat had an incidence rate of only 1.6% to 2.6%.
    In most parts of Xinjiang, crops are harvested once a year. In the past, winter wheat, which accounted for nearly half of the sown area, was planted in the autumn, and most other crops were planted in late spring and early summer. Due to the large area of land and the small number of people, labor, animal power, and agricultural implements were very tight every year during the sowing and harvesting seasons. After implementing winter sowing of spring crops, the past shortage of labor, animal power, and agricultural implements during the sowing period was greatly alleviated. The time for winter sowing of spring crops in various places is roughly from after the first frost to before the soil freezes each year.

### 新疆大力推广春种作物冬播

    农业耕作制度的一项重大改革
    新疆大力推广春种作物冬播
    试验证明：春种作物冬播成熟早，产量高；根系发育强大，抗旱、抗病、抗倒伏能力大大提高。全区冬播农作物已由春麦扩大到油菜、胡麻、青稞等六种。
    新华社乌鲁木齐12日电  新疆维吾尔自治区在耕作制度上开始一项重大的改革：冬播农作物已由过去的春麦一项，增加到油菜、胡麻、青稞、豌豆、红花等六种。冬季播种地区已遍及伊犁哈萨克族自治州、昌吉回族自治州、哈密专区、焉耆盆地和南疆喀什噶尔河和叶尔羌河流域多数县份。去年冬季，全区冬播面积达到一百四十多万亩，比上一年扩大了十倍多。此外还冬播春菜四万多亩。
    春种作物冬播后，种子在地里过冬，第二年春天发芽生长。这是新疆农业生产的一项大胆革新。这项革新，是在经过试验的基础上实行的。自治区各地几年来的试验证明，冬播农作物比春播成熟期早半个月左右，产量也高。一般冬播春麦增产15％到20％，胡麻增产15％到22％，油菜增产42％到60％。由于冬季播种后，农作物种籽一冬都在作发育准备，并经受过种种恶劣自然条件的考验，因而春季生长出来以后，更加茁壮、坚强、耐寒，种籽品质有很大的提高。
    新疆生产兵团焉耆垦区农业科学研究所用冬播春麦第一年所收获的种籽，再进行冬播或春播，都比原来春麦种籽增产8％到16％。连续两年冬播的种籽，平均增产40％。经过测定生长状况证明：冬播种籽次生根数、根重、株高、穗重和粒重都比春播种籽有显著增加。他们的结论是，冬播也是复壮种籽的良好办法。
    春种作物冬播，根系发育强大，入土要比春种作物深三厘米至十四厘米，因此，抗旱抗病抗倒伏能力也大大提高了。中共伊吾县委会在总结1956年和1957年冬种春麦经验时，发现春播春麦锈病发病叶片占70％到80％，而冬播春麦发病叶片仅占10％到20％。焉耆一个国营农场调查结果证明，春播春麦黑穗病一般发病率达到6．8％，最高的达10．8％，而冬播春麦只有1．6％到2．6％的发病率。
    新疆绝大部分地区农作物一年一熟，过去，占播种面积近半的冬麦都挤在秋季播种，其他大部分农作物挤在晚春初夏播种，由于地多人少，每年播种和收获季节，劳动力、畜力和农具都十分紧张，实行春种作物冬播后，大大减轻了过去播种期劳力、畜力、农具紧张状况。各地春作物冬播的时间，大致在每年霜降后到土壤结冻前。
