    Vigorously Develop Woody Oil Crops
    Just as the whole country is celebrating the harvest and welcoming the New Year, good news has come from Shandong: a new and promising woody oil tree species—the Oil Seed Tree—has been discovered. The woody oil production front has thus gained a new force.
    Whether for industrial and agricultural production or people's lives, oil is indispensable. In recent years, although China's oil production has increased significantly, it is still far from meeting the needs of all aspects. With the rapid development of socialist construction and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the demand for industrial and edible oil will inevitably increase in the future. Therefore, vigorously developing oil production has become a very important task on the agricultural production front. To develop oil production, we must greatly develop herbaceous oil crops; however, it is not enough to only focus on herbaceous oil crops. Herbaceous oil crops all require arable land, and we cannot expand planting indefinitely; woody oil crops, on the other hand, do not occupy arable land and can be greatly developed in barren mountainous areas. Therefore, while vigorously developing herbaceous oil crops, vigorously developing woody oil crops is an important way to solve the current shortage of edible oil supply and the country's long-term need for oil.
    China has superior natural conditions and a wide variety of woody oil tree species, most of which have development prospects. At present, in addition to vigorously developing major woody oil crops such as oil-tea camellia, walnuts, tung oil trees, and Chinese tallow trees, all regions should also continue to carry out investigation work, further understand the resource situation, and actively develop some high-quality oil tree species that are suitable for local growth and that the masses are accustomed to managing, to broaden oil sources and increase oil production. In carrying out this work, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party committees and rely closely on the people's communes and the broad masses to do the work better. After discovering the oil seed tree, a high-quality oil tree species deeply loved by the masses, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee immediately organized forces to conduct a detailed investigation throughout the province, to understand the resource situation and its growth habits. Then, based on the results of the investigation and research, it decided to vigorously develop it throughout the province. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, made a unified development plan for oil seed trees and other woody oil crops such as walnuts and Chinese prickly ash, and implemented the plan to the counties and people's communes through on-site meetings. At the same time, it also immediately took practical measures to protect the existing oil seed tree mother trees and mobilized the masses to use all the existing seeds for seedling cultivation, striving to develop 1.05 billion woody oil trees in three years and achieve self-sufficiency in woody oil in ten years. This approach is worth referring to by all regions.
    According to the investigation in Shandong Province, the oil seed tree has proven to be an excellent woody oil tree. Not only does it have a high oil content, a delicious oil flavor, and is loved by the masses, but it is also very easy to cultivate. It can grow well in areas with thin soil and rocky mountainous areas where walnuts are not suitable. Areas with similar climate and soil conditions in North China can actively introduce it for planting, after experimentation, according to local conditions.
    In the winter and spring afforestation campaign, all regions should, while vigorously building timber forests and shelter forests, also plan to vigorously build various oil forests, establish some concentrated and contiguous woody oil production bases, and strive to reclaim all the barren oil-tea camellia mountains and tung oil tree mountains as soon as possible, so that the output of woody oil can increase rapidly.

### 大力发展木本油料

    大力发展木本油料
    正当全国各地欢庆丰收，喜迎新春的时刻，从山东又传来了喜讯：新发现了一种优良的、有发展前途的木本油料树种——油种子树。木本油料生产战线从此又增加一支新军。
    不论工农业生产或人民生活，都离不了油料。几年来，我国油料产量虽有很大增长，但还远远不能满足各方面的需要。随着社会主义建设的高速度发展和人民生活水平的不断提高，今后对工业用油和食用油的需求，势必越来越大。因此，大力发展油料生产就成为农业生产战线上的一个很重要的任务。发展油料生产，要大大发展草本油料作物；但仅仅抓草本油料作物是不够的。草本油料作物都要占用耕地，我们不可能无限量地扩大种植；而木本油料作物却不占用耕地，可以向荒地山区大量发展。因此，在大力发展草本油料作物的同时，也大力发展木本油料，是解决当前食油供应不足和国家对油料的长远需要的重要途径。
    我国自然条件优越，木本油料树种繁多，其中大部分都具有发展前途。目前，各地除应大力发展油茶、核桃、油桐、乌柏等主要木本油料作物外，还应当继续开展调查工作，进一步摸清资源情况，积极发展一些适合本地生长、群众有经营习惯的优良油料树，以广开油源，增产油料。在进行这一工作中，要加强党委领导，紧紧依靠各人民公社和广大群众，才能把工作做得更好。山东省在发现油种子树这一深受群众喜爱的优良油料树种后，省委立即组织力量在全省范围内进行了细致的调查工作，摸清了资源情况和它的生长习性，然后根据调查研究的结果，决定在全省范围内大力发展。省农林厅根据省委指示，将油种子树与核桃、花椒等木本油料作出了统一发展的规划，并通过现场会议将规划落实到县和人民公社。同时，还立即采取切实的措施，保护现有油种子树母树，发动群众把现有种子全部用来育苗，争取三年后发展木本油料树十亿五千万棵，十年后实现木本油料自给。这种作法是值得各地参考的。
    油种子树，根据山东省的调查，证明是一种优良的木本油料树。它不仅果实含油率高，油香味美，群众爱吃，而且非常容易栽培，在核桃不宜生长的土质瘠薄地区和青石山区，都能很好生长。华北各地气候、土壤条件相近似的地区，都可因地制宜，经过试验，积极引种。
    在冬春季造林运动中，各地在大力营造用材林、防护林的同时，也应有计划地大力营造各种油料林，建立一些集中成片的木本油料生产基地，并争取及早把全部荒芜的油茶山、油桐山垦复过来，使木本油料产量迅速增长。
