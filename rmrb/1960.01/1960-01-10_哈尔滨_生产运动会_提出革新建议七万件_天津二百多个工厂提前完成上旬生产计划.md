Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 9th: Harbin workers are adopting the form of "Production Olympic Games" to carry out a vigorous socialist labor emulation campaign to ensure a good start, a red month, and a successful first quarter this year. This large-scale competition started on New Year's Day this year. At present, workers in the city's machinery, metallurgy, light industry, chemical industry, grain processing, capital construction, transportation, trade and district street industries have all joined this competition.

Since the launch of this large-scale city-wide "Production Olympic Games," the broad masses of workers have been innovating and striving to become "production champions," and good news about production has been continuously pouring in. According to the statistics of the past week, workers in various industrial systems have put forward more than 73,000 innovation suggestions. After these technological innovation projects are quickly realized, production efficiency has been greatly improved. On New Year's Day alone, more than 13,000 production workers in the city completed two days' worth of work in one day. Workers at the Harbin Chemical Plant completed more than a month's work in just over four days. As of January 6th, 124 factories in the city, including the Xinfeng Luo Factory, Jiancheng Machinery Factory, Xiangtai Internal Combustion Engine Factory, Fengli Tool Factory, Songjiang Chemical Factory, and Harbin Rubber Factory, have completed their production plans for the first ten days of January more than four days ahead of schedule.

The competition form of the "Production Olympic Games" was created by the Jiamusi Textile Factory. The "Production Olympic Games" currently being promoted in Harbin is broader in scope and richer in content. It is a grand-scale socialist labor emulation campaign launched by 580,000 workers in the city's twelve industrial systems. The competition is carried out by industry and by type of work. Everyone has a competition target, and every item has competition conditions. Skilled workers compete with skilled workers, apprentices compete with apprentices, and service personnel compete with service personnel. According to the deployment of the relevant leading departments of the city, the city's "Production Olympic Games" from New Year's Day to the 10th is the factory-level preliminary selection period, from the 11th to the 14th is the semi-final selection period, and from the 15th onwards, in conjunction with the convening of the city's model worker conference, the final of the city's "Production Olympic Games" will be held.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 9th: As of the 8th, more than 200 factories in Tianjin have completed their production plans for the first ten days of this month ahead of schedule.

As soon as they entered 1960, the broad masses of workers in Tianjin quickly pushed the cross-year competition to a new climax through various forms, achieving a good start and daily red achievements. Workers at the Xintai Dyeing Factory launched a "three-comparison" competition on the first day of work, comparing targets before shifts, comparing energy during shifts, and comparing results after shifts. All 56 production groups in the factory broke through production quotas and completed their production plans for the first ten days of January ahead of schedule by the 7th. Many factories continued to carry out technical innovations and technical revolutions in the competition, which doubled production efficiency. The highest daily output of the Ruixing Dyeing Factory last year was 25,000 meters; this year, in the first three days, six major technical measures were realized, boldly improving the dyeing method, making the daily output jump to 60,000 meters, and completing the production plan for the first ten days of January in the first five days. Workers at the Feilong Rubber Factory created a dry ice edge removal method, which increased production efficiency by 250 times and saved 30 workers. Many factories have paid attention to completing production plans in a more, faster, better, and more economical way and realizing an all-round leap forward from the beginning of this year. Since the New Year, the Tianjin Coking Plant has focused on output value, output, and quality, and promptly solved problems, thus achieving not only high output but also high quality. A workshop of the Yongxing Dyeing Factory had low output and poor quality of dyeing grass-green cloth. The factory's leaders worked in this workshop and adopted the "three-in-one combination" method to research and experiment, and finally successfully experimented with using a calender instead of a dyeing tank for pre-dyeing treatment, which greatly increased the daily output by 40％, and the rework rate decreased from 10％ in the past to 0.3％, while also greatly saving raw materials.

    哈尔滨“生产运动会”提出革新建议七万件
    天津二百多个工厂提前完成上旬生产计划
    新华社哈尔滨9日电　哈尔滨职工正在采用“生产运动会”的形式，开展热火朝天的社会主义劳动竞赛，以保证实现今年开门红、月月红、首季满堂红。这一大规模的竞赛是从今年的元旦开始的。目前，全市机械、冶金、轻工业、化学工业、粮食加工、基本建设、交通运输、财贸及区街工业等行业的职工，都已投入了这一竞赛。
    这个声势浩大的全市性的“生产运动会”展开以后，广大职工人人闹革新、个个争当“生产冠军”，生产捷报不断传出。据最近一周的统计，各产业系统职工共提出革新建议七万三千多项。这些技术革新项目迅速实现以后，生产效率大大提高，全市在元旦当天就有一万三千多名生产工人一天完成了两天的工作量。哈尔滨化工总厂职工在最近四天多的时间之内完成了一个多月的工作量。到本月6日止，全市有新风罗工厂、建成机械厂、祥泰内燃机厂、锋利工具厂、松江化学厂和哈尔滨橡胶厂等一百二十四个工厂，提前四天以上完成了上旬生产计划。
    “生产运动会”的竞赛形式，是佳木斯纺织厂创造的。目前哈尔滨所推行的“生产运动会”，范围更广泛，内容更丰富，是全市十二个产业系统的五十八万职工开展的一次规模盛大的社会主义劳动竞赛。竞赛是按行业、按工种进行的。人人有竞赛对象，项项有竞赛条件。技工和技工赛，徒工和徒工赛，服务人员和服务人员赛。按照市的有关领导部门的部署，全市“生产运动会”从元旦开始到10日为厂级预赛选拔期，从11日到14日为复赛选拔期，从15日以后将结合全市劳模大会的召开，举行全市“生产运动会”的最后决赛。
    新华社天津9日电　天津市有二百多个工厂到8日为止已提前完成本月上旬生产计划。
    一跨进1960年，天津市广大职工就通过各种形式把跨年竞赛迅速推向新高潮，实现了开门红、日日红。信泰染厂职工在开工生产的第一天就展开班前比指标、班上比干劲、班后比成绩的“三比”竞赛，全厂五十六个生产小组都突破生产定额，到7日止提前完成了上旬生产计划。许多工厂在竞赛中继续大闹技术革新和技术革命，使生产效率成倍提高。瑞兴染厂去年最高日产量是二万五千米；今年头三天实现了六项重大技术措施，大胆地改进染布方法，使日产跃到了六万米，头五天就完成了上旬生产计划。飞龙橡胶厂职工创造干冰除边法，提高生产效率二百五十倍，并且节省了三十个劳动力。许多工厂今年一开始就注意多快好省地完成生产计划，实现全面跃进。天津焦化厂新年以来，大抓产值、产量、质量，发现问题及时解决，因而不仅达到了高产，而且达到了优质。永兴染厂一个车间染草绿色布产量低、质量差，工厂的领导干部就在这个车间跟班劳动，并且采用“三结合”的办法边研究边试验，终于试验成功了用轧炼机代替染槽作染前处理，使日产量猛增40％，返工率由过去的10％降低到0．3％，同时还大大节省了原料材料。
