When vigorously developing the pig-raising industry, in addition to actively increasing the number of pigs, we must also attach importance to improving the quality of pigs. This means that the pigs we raise should have a high reproduction rate, a short fattening time, a high meat yield, and require less feed. How can we achieve this goal? Promoting the economic crossbreeding of pigs is a shortcut to increasing pork production and improving the quality of pigs.

Domestic and foreign experience has proved that the first-generation hybrids of pigs have very strong vitality, which is reflected in the fact that under the same fattening time and the same feeding conditions, hybrid pigs gain weight faster and have a higher meat yield than local purebred pigs. The article "Promoting Economic Crossbreeding of Pigs," published in this newspaper today, provides ample factual basis for this issue and makes a scientific exposition.

How much higher can the weight of hybrid breeding pigs be compared to local purebred pigs? This depends on whether the crossbreeding combination has fully exploited the "hybrid vigor." According to a comparison between the hybrid of the Shaziling sow and the Yorkshire boar and the purebred Shaziling pig, when raised to the same age of ten months, the weight of the hybrid pig is 105.6 kilograms, while the purebred pig is only 85.6 kilograms, a difference of 20 kilograms. If each pig is calculated to gain 20 kilograms, 180 million pigs nationwide can gain 3.6 billion kilograms; calculated at 80 kilograms per pig, it is equivalent to raising 45 million more pigs. This is truly a promising method!

Some people believe that to make pigs grow faster, they need to be fed more feed. Since hybrid breeding pigs gain weight faster than local purebred pigs, does the amount of feed consumed increase accordingly? No, the feed not only does not increase, but the feed conversion rate is improved (the so-called feed conversion rate is the amount of feed consumed to produce one kilogram of pork). This is because hybrid pigs fully exploit the common advantages of different breeds, making their metabolism vigorous and their ability to absorb nutrients strong. All these advantages are determined by the internal factors of the hybrid pig's constitution. Therefore, promoting the economic crossbreeding of pigs can not only make pigs gain weight quickly but also save feed, which provides us with very favorable conditions for developing the pig-raising industry at high speed.

However, in promoting the economic crossbreeding of pigs, all localities should pay attention to one issue: a portion of the local fine breeds must be retained so that there are a sufficient number of "raw materials" for economic crossbreeding. To achieve this, overall consideration and comprehensive planning should be given to breeding work to ensure that two different breeds can be permanently maintained within a commune to facilitate long-term economic crossbreeding.

    一个多快好省的方法
    在大力发展养猪事业的时候，除了积极增加猪的数量外，还必须重视提高猪的质量。这就是说，我们养的猪繁殖率要高，育肥时间要短，出肉率要高，饲料要用的少。怎样才能达到这个目的呢？推广猪的经济杂交，是增产猪肉、提高猪的质量的一条捷径。
    国内外的经验证明，猪的一代杂种的生活力非常旺盛，这表现在相同的育肥时间和相同的饲养条件下，杂种猪要比本地纯种猪增重快、出肉率高。今天本报发表的“推广猪的经济杂交”一文，对这个问题提出了充分的事实根据，并作了科学的阐述。
    杂交种猪究竟比本地纯种猪体重能高多少？这要看杂交组合是否充分发挥了“杂种优势”。按照湖南沙子岭母猪和约克夏公猪杂交种与沙子岭纯种猪比较，同样养到十个月大，杂种猪体重为一百零五点六公斤，而纯种猪只有八十五点六公斤，两者相差二十公斤。如果每头猪按增重二十公斤计算，全国一亿八千万头猪，可增重三十六亿公斤；按八十公斤折合一头猪，即等于多养了四千五百万头猪。这真是一个大有可为的办法！
    有人认为，要猪长的快，就需要多喂饲料。杂交种猪既然比本地纯种猪增重快，饲料消耗量是不是相应地增加？不，饲料不仅不增加，饲料报酬反而提高了（所谓饲料报酬，即出一斤猪肉所消耗的饲料）。这是由于杂种猪充分发挥了不同品种的共同优点，使其新陈代谢能力旺盛，吸收营养的能力强。这一切优点，是由于杂种猪的体质的内在因素所决定。因此，提倡猪的经济杂交，既能使猪增重快，又能节省饲料，这就为我们高速度发展养猪业提供了十分优越的条件。
    但是，各地在推广猪的经济杂交中，要注意一个问题：必须保留一部分本地优良种，以便在经济杂交中有足够数量的“原始材料”。要做到这一点，就应该在繁殖育种工作上加以通盘考虑，全面规划，保证在一个公社内，能够永久保持两个不同的品种，以利于长期进行经济杂交。
