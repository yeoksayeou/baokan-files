Visiting Happy Families Before the Spring Festival
By our reporter Sun Shikai

It's the eve of the Spring Festival. The streets and alleys of Beijing are filled with joy.

At this joyous moment, I visited Weijia Courtyard in Dongcheng District, Beijing.  Ke Rongzhen, the director of the residents' committee, said to me as we walked, "This courtyard has 31 households, more than 140 people. More than a year ago, they started a production group and a public canteen. Life is harmonious, like a family." Walking into the courtyard, bursts of hearty laughter came from the neighbors. At this time, Grandma Wang, a gray-haired woman, came out of the east room and invited us to sit in her house. I was about to ask about her family's New Year shopping when the old lady preemptively said, "Now it's really getting better every year. Fish, meat, even peppercorns and star anise are all prepared. The stores provide even more considerate service, sometimes even delivering to our doorsteps. We women participating in production can relax!" As the old lady spoke, she laughed, and even the wrinkles on her face were stretched open with joy. Then, she spoke eloquently about the situation of their asbestos production group and everyone's enthusiasm...

According to old habits, several days before the Spring Festival, housewives would be busy preparing for the New Year. This year, things are different. On the eve of the Spring Festival, many housewives are still reluctant to put down their work. While we were talking, Grandma Wang saw her third son coming and suddenly interrupted the topic, urging her son, "Hurry up and get some work from the factory. There are plenty of people at home during the Spring Festival, and someone can take care of the children. I have to free up my hands to spin more asbestos rope." She turned her head and pointed to the corner, saying to me with a smile, "In the past, I set up a Buddhist shrine there, praying to gods and Buddhas during festivals, but life never got better. After liberation, I stopped believing in those things. The whole family participates in production and labor, and life gets better year by year."

Everyone in the neighborhood can tell about the changes in the Wang family over the past decade. Old Man Wang had a small stall in this alley for more than 30 years, and he never had dumplings for a Spring Festival meal before liberation. Now, the eldest son is a worker, the second son is in school, and the daughter-in-law is a nursery worker. There are no idle people in the family. Three certificates of advanced producers are hanging on the wall, two of which are awarded to Grandma Wang. From this simple old lady, who could have imagined that she had lived in this courtyard for half her life and never stepped out of the gate, is now the leader of the production group, becoming a shock worker on the street production front.

Leaving the Wang family, I went to visit the Lu family.

This family is even more lively. Three generations of more than ten people, sons and daughters have all returned, the whole family is reunited. Grandma Lu is sewing quilts with her third daughter. When she saw us coming, she put down her work, picked up her little granddaughter, and warmly welcomed us, chatting with us: "Usually, the sons, daughters, and daughters-in-law are all outside, some are workers, some are nursery workers, nurses, and some are in school. Only I, the old woman, am left at home, but I am not idle taking care of the children, and I also participate in the street production group to spin asbestos rope in my spare time."

At this moment, an old man suddenly came in and told us what dishes would be served for dinner in the canteen. I almost mistook him for Grandpa Lu. Grandma Lu immediately introduced: "This Grandpa Geng is the administrator of our canteen and the housekeeper of the whole courtyard. Every day, he goes door-to-door to inform everyone what the canteen is serving that day and also asks what everyone likes to eat." From the conversation, we learned that Grandpa Lu is the cook in the canteen. More than a year ago, all the women with labor power in the courtyard, in addition to participating in the work in outside factories and nurseries, those burdened with housework all participated in the production group in the courtyard. At that time, Grandpa Lu, who had been a mason for many years, volunteered to be the cook in the courtyard, cooking for everyone, because he was old. Now, Grandpa Lu has become the busiest person in the whole courtyard, rushing to steam buns for each family early and late, and the canteen does the cooking for anyone who has fish or meat. The day before the Spring Festival, he steamed eighty catties of buns for everyone, charging only three cents per catty for coal and alkali, which made everyone very happy.

Grandma Lu became more and more enthusiastic as she talked about Grandpa Lu's spirit of serving everyone. She said: "In previous years, without a public canteen, the whole family would have been busy around the stove before the Spring Festival. Now that we have a canteen, the staple food is prepared early, which is really convenient and worry-free. Recently, our courtyard's canteen was also rated as an advanced unit in the street."

The residents in this large mixed courtyard used to be odd-jobbers, small stall owners, or rickshaw pullers. The livelihood situation of many families was "three days of fishing, two days of drying nets." Now, they all have fixed jobs; women who depended on men for a living have also joined production, and there have been many people like Grandma Wang and Grandpa Lu. Not only do they all have happy families, but they also care about their neighbors and want to do more for everyone. Li Suzhen's family has a small population and she is physically strong, so she voluntarily took on the role of service team leader for the whole courtyard, helping any family with household chores when they are busy. Old Lady Guo, who lives in the gatehouse, doesn't feel lonely even though she has no children. Before the festival, the elementary school students in the courtyard helped the old lady clean her house and bought meat and vegetables. On New Year's Eve, the old woman stewed a pot of meat, steaming hot.

When celebrating the Spring Festival in this era of the Great Leap Forward, every household in the courtyard, adults and children, are reunited together, truly the spring is strong and happiness is boundless!

    春节前夕访幸福人家
    本报记者　孙世恺
    春节前夕。北京的街头巷尾，喜气洋洋。
    在这个欢乐的时刻，我访问了北京东城区魏家大院。居民委员会主任柯荣珍一边走一边对我说：“这个大院有三十一户，一百四十多口人。一年多以前办起生产组，又办起公共食堂，生活和美，好像一家人。”走进院里，左邻右舍就传来一阵阵爽朗的笑声。这时，东屋走出一位鬓发花白的王大妈，请我们到她家坐坐。我正想问问她家办年货的情况，还没等开口，老大妈就抢先说：“现在真是一年赛过一年，鱼呀，肉呀，连花椒大料，都准备好了。商店服务更周到，有时还送货上门，我们这些参加生产的妇女可省心啦！”老大妈说着说着就乐起来，连满脸的皱纹都笑开了。接着，她又滔滔不绝地讲起她们石棉生产组的情况和大家的干劲……。
    按照老习惯，春节前好几天，家庭妇女们就成天张罗着办年货了，今年可变样啦。在春节的前夕，许多家庭妇女还不肯放下手中的活。在我们谈话时，王大妈瞧见她三儿子来了，突然中断了话题，忙着催促她儿子说：“你快去厂里领些活，春节期间正好家里人多，孩子有人带，我可得腾出手多纺些石棉绳。”她回过头来又指着墙角，笑呵呵地对我说：“过去，我在那里设佛龛，逢年过节求神拜佛，日子从来没过好；解放后不信那些了，一家人都参加了生产劳动，生活一年比一年美。”
    街坊邻居谁都能说出王家十年来的变化。王老头就在这条胡同摆了三十多年的小摊，解放前那个春节也没吃过一顿饺子。现在，大儿子当工人，二儿子上学，儿媳妇又是保育员，全家没闲人。墙上挂着三张先进生产者的奖状，其中有两张就是奖给王大妈的。从这位朴实的老大妈身上，谁能料到她在这院住了半辈子，从没迈出过大门的人，现在却当上了生产组长，变成街道生产战线上的突击手。
    走出王家，我又到芦家去串门。
    这家更热闹。老少三辈十多口人，儿子闺女都回来了，一家人团聚着。芦大妈正和三闺女缝被子。她见到我们来了，就放下手里的活，一面抱起小孙女，一面热情地招待我们，和我们闲谈起来：“平常日子，儿子、闺女和儿媳妇都在外边，有的当工人，有的做保育员、护士，也有的上学，家里就剩下我这老太太，可我照顾孩子也不闲着，抓空还参加街道生产组纺石棉绳。”
    这时，忽然进来一位老大爷，告诉说食堂里晚饭时吃些什么饭菜。我还以为是芦大爷，差点认错了人。芦大妈马上介绍说：“这位耿大爷是我们食堂的管理员，也是全院的管家人，他每天都沿家挨户通知当天食堂吃什么，还征求大家爱吃什么。”从谈话中，我们才知道芦大爷就是食堂里的炊事员。一年多以前，全院有劳动力的妇女除了参加外边工厂、托儿所的工作以外，有家务拖累的人都参加了院内的生产组。当时，干了多年瓦匠的芦大爷，因为自己年纪大了，就自愿当院里的炊事员，给大家做饭。现在，芦大爷成了全院最忙碌的人，赶早摸黑赶着给各家蒸馒头，谁家有鱼有肉，食堂都代做。春节前一天就代蒸了八十斤面的馒头，每斤面只收三分钱的煤、碱钱，大家可高兴啦。
    芦大妈谈到芦大爷为大家服务的精神越谈越浓。她说：“往年没有公共食堂，在春节前一家人早就得围着锅台忙起来了；现在有了食堂，早把主食做好了，真是又省事又省心。最近，我们院的食堂还被评为街道上的先进单位。”
    这个大杂院里的住户，过去都是做小工、摆小摊，或者是蹬三轮的。许多人家谋生的情况，是“三天打鱼，两天晒网”。现在，都有固定的职业；靠男人生活的妇女也参加了生产，还出现了不少像王大妈和芦大爷这样的人。他们不仅都有个幸福的家庭，还关心街坊邻居，都想多为大家做些事。李素珍家中人口少，体力又壮，自愿担当全院的服务小组长，看谁家忙了，就帮谁家办些家务。住在门房的郭老太太，没儿没女也不显得孤单。院里的小学生在节前帮助老大妈打扫了屋子，买了肉和菜。除夕晚上、老人燉了一锅肉，热气腾腾。
    在这大跃进的年代里过春节的时候，大院里的家家户户，大人孩子都团聚在一起，真是春意正浓，幸福无穷！（附图片）

    魏家大院的孩子们不再经常殴斗了。寒假期间，他们组织了一个“儿童之家”，在里面看小人书、讲故事、下跳棋。初中二年级学生耿文福（左二）讲“小罗成”的故事，把孩子们逗乐了
