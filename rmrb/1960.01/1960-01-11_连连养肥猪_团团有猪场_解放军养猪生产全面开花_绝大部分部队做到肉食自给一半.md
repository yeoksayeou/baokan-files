Raising Fat Pigs in Every Company; Pig Farms in Every Regiment
The People's Liberation Army's Pig-Raising Production Blooms Across the Board
The Vast Majority of Units Achieve 50% Self-Sufficiency in Meat

(Our report) The pig-raising production of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has greatly developed, basically achieving "fat pigs in every company, pig farms in every regiment." The vast majority of units are now about 50% self-sufficient in meat, and individual units even have surpluses that can support fraternal units or the national market. Party and government departments in places like Beijing and Shanghai recently held on-site meetings in local garrisons, believing that the pig-raising experience of some troops could guide local organizations, schools, and industrial and mining enterprises.

1959 was a year of large-scale pig-raising by the troops in their spare time, and many units saw their pig numbers multiply. The troops stationed in Zhejiang Province now have 20,000 more pigs than in the first half of 1959, more than three times the number at the end of 1958. A naval unit had no pigs in 1958 but raised 800 in 1959. The characteristic of the troops' pig-raising is that it blooms across the board. Not only do companies, battalions, and regiments raise pigs, but also offices, schools, hospitals, factories, and warehouses, and in large numbers. The Political Department of the troops in the Jinan area now has an average of 1.91 pigs per person. A certain automobile school has achieved one pig per person. A hospital stationed in Shanghai now has two pigs per person. The pigs raised by these advanced units generally grow fast and strong.

Under the principle of "keep all females, select later," the number of sows has increased significantly. Some units now have one sow for every seven pigs, enabling them to breed and raise their own pigs.

In non-agricultural production units, how can one raise more and better pigs without spending money or spending little money? How to solve specific problems such as feed, pigsties, epidemic prevention, and management? The most important experience is that the Party committee takes the lead, leaders take the field, and the broad masses of officers and soldiers start working and offer suggestions. After the troops started raising pigs in large numbers, the first difficulty they encountered was insufficient feed. In addition to reclaiming wasteland to grow feed crops and setting up flour mills and tofu workshops to solve the problem of concentrated feed, a large amount of green fodder was collected and cultivated by the officers and soldiers in their spare time. Under the slogan of "rely on the mountains if you live by the mountains, rely on the sea if you live by the sea," coastal troops often go to the sea to collect seaweed and kelp to feed pigs; soldiers stationed in mountainous areas go deep into the dense forests to find green fodder; and troops stationed in cities often use the early morning and evening hours to collect rotten vegetable leaves and watermelon rinds near vegetable markets and fruit shops. Some soldiers also dug ponds near the barracks to raise high-yielding green fodder such as water hyacinth and water lettuce. Because everyone is involved, the supply of feed is constant. Many troops now have enough feed stored to feed the pigs they raise for half a year. When expanding pigpens and pigsties, most units also used local materials and everyone got involved. Hospitals in Nanjing, Shenyang, and other regions have also set up pharmaceutical factories to manufacture large quantities of veterinary chlortetracycline, tetra-sulfanilamide, and bis-dehydrodoisynolic acid drugs, which are distributed to the troops' pig farms.

In order to make the pigs grow fast and fat, many troop leaders often study feeding experience with the feeders. Colonel Liu Kekuan, political commissar of a certain unit in the Beijing area, went to the pig farm to feed pigs during his time as a soldier in the company. When feeding pigs, he carefully observed the situation of each pig, learned the rules from it, and then referred to pig-raising books, summed up some pig-raising experience, and helped the feeders establish a complete set of systems. Many units have held on-site meetings to promote advanced pig-raising experience, and some units have also held training classes to train feeders in rotation. Now most troops have learned new feeding methods, achieving separate pen management, quantitative feeding, regular injections, disinfection, and keeping the pig pens clean, the feed clean, the feeding troughs clean, and the pigs clean.

    连连养肥猪　团团有猪场
    解放军养猪生产全面开花
    绝大部分部队做到肉食自给一半
    本报讯　中国人民解放军养猪生产有很大发展，基本上做到了“连连有肥猪，团团有猪场”。绝大部分部队现在已经自给肉食一半左右，个别单位还自给有余，能够支援兄弟部队或国家市场。北京、上海等地方党政部门最近在当地驻军中召开现场会议，认为有些部队的养猪经验，对地方机关、学校、工矿企业有指导作用。
    1959年是部队利用业余时间大量养猪的一年，许多部队养猪数量成倍增长。驻浙江部队现有的猪比1959年上半年多了两万头，等于1958年年底的三倍多。海军某部1958年一头猪都没有，1959年养了八百头。部队养猪的特点是全面开花，不仅连、营、团养猪，机关、学校、医院、工厂、仓库也养猪，而且数量很大。济南地区部队政治部现有猪平均每人一点九一头。某汽车学校实现了一人一头猪。驻上海的某医院现在是一人两头猪。这些先进单位养的猪一般是长得快，长得壮。
    在“见雌就留，先留后选”的方针下，母猪数量大量增加，有些单位已经做到每七头猪当中有一头母猪，能够自繁自养。
    在非农业生产单位里，怎样才能不花钱、少花钱，而多养猪、养好猪？怎样解决饲料、猪舍、防疫、管理等具体问题？最主要的经验是党委挂帅，领导上阵，发动广大官兵人人动手，个个献策。部队大量养猪以后，首先遇到的困难是饲料不足，他们除了开荒种饲料地，开设粉坊、豆腐坊等解决精饲料以外，大量的青饲料都是官兵们利用业余时间收集和培植的。在“靠山吃山、靠海吃海”的口号下，沿海的部队经常下海捞海菜、海藻喂猪；驻山区的战士深入丛山密林，寻找青饲料；驻城市的部队常常利用早晚的时间到菜市场、水果店附近，收集烂菜叶、西瓜皮。有些战士还在营区附近挖水塘，养殖水浮莲、水葫芦等高产青饲料。由于大家动手，饲料源源不绝，许多部队现在储藏的饲料，足够养的猪半年食用。在扩建猪圈、猪舍时，各部队也多半是就地取材，人人动手。南京、沈阳等地区部队的医院还办起制药厂，大量制造畜用金霉素、四黄素、双拍二母素等药品，分发到部队养猪场使用。
    为了使猪长得快，长得肥，许多部队领导干部经常和饲养人员一起研究饲养经验。北京地区部队某部政治委员刘克宽上校在下连当兵期间，到养猪场喂猪；喂猪时他仔细观察每头猪的情况，从中摸索规律，然后参考养猪的书籍，总结出一些养猪经验，帮助饲养员建立起一套完整的制度。许多部队都召开现场会议，推广先进的养猪经验，有些单位还举办训练班轮训饲养人员。现在大多数部队都学会了新的饲养方法，做到分栏管理，定量饲养，定时打针、消毒和保持猪栏净、饲料净、食槽净、猪体净。（附图片）
