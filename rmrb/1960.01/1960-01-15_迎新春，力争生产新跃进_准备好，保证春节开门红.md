    Greet the New Year, Strive for a New Leap Forward in Production
    Be Prepared, Guarantee a Flying Start to the Spring Festival
    First Automobile Works
    (Our dispatch from Changchun, January 14th) The First Automobile Works is pushing technical innovation and technical revolution to another new high tide through large-scale breakthroughs, large-scale promotion, and large-scale demonstrations, to ensure a flying start after the Spring Festival and a red-hot year from beginning to end.
    The production situation at the First Automobile Works since the beginning of the new year is as follows: in the first ten days, various production targets exceeded the level of the same period in December last year. The flowers of technical innovation are blooming throughout the plant, breaking the old routine of slackness at the beginning of the year and at the beginning of the month, reflecting the characteristics of the new leap forward situation in the plant in 1960.
    Before the Spring Festival, the main task of the First Automobile Works' workers is to besiege key technical bottlenecks. Currently, more than twenty "breakthrough teams" at the factory level are using the form of "setting off firecrackers to welcome the Spring Festival" (i.e., breaking through technical key points to welcome the Spring Festival) to besiege twenty-three major technical bottlenecks. Workers in the chassis workshop have also created a form of "going to the market to celebrate the Spring Festival" (i.e., experience exchange, passing on "scripture" and taking "treasure" meetings) to promote more than two hundred technical innovations, improve equipment capabilities, and reduce labor intensity.
    In order to ensure a flying start to the Spring Festival, various workshops have attached particular importance to safe production, eliminating major personal and equipment accidents, and making preparations for material supply, equipment maintenance, and environmental sanitation. During the Spring Festival, the factory will also organize four art performance teams to perform in the People's Communes, and organize dozens of amateur worker-writers to visit the communes, create poems, clapper talks, dances, etc., to praise the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, the People's Communes, and the worker-peasant alliance.
    Beijing First Machine Tool Plant
    (Our dispatch) The workers of the Beijing First Machine Tool Plant are seizing the current production on the one hand and actively making preparations on the other hand, striving to complete the January production tasks ahead of the Spring Festival and ensure a flying start to production after the Spring Festival.
    According to the "routine" that no finished products were produced at the beginning of the month, which was broken on the first day of this year, the factory is now grasping early and making full preparations to ensure that machine tools are produced on the first day after the Spring Festival. As of the 14th, most of the various tools and blanks required for February have been prepared. One-third of the complete set of parts required for assembling machine tools have been manufactured.
    At the same time, technical performance competitions have been widely launched throughout the plant to continue promoting advanced tools and advanced operating methods, carry out large-scale collaboration, and solve key problems, so as to create good conditions for a flying start to the Spring Festival.
    While grasping the current production, the factory's leading departments are actively arranging cultural and recreational activities before and after the Spring Festival and improving food. The amateur cultural troupe is preparing many wonderful programs for the workers to spend the Spring Festival happily.
    Taiyuan Railway Bureau
    (Our dispatch from Taiyuan, January 14th) All staff and workers of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Railways are actively preparing for a flying start to Spring Festival transportation.
    In the first eleven days of January, the number of loaded and unloaded cars and the amount of coal transported from Shanxi to other places by the Taiyuan Railway Bureau exceeded the average level of December last year. Various technical and economic indicators, such as freight car turnaround time, have also been greatly improved compared with December last year. The passenger and freight transportation tasks of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau will be heavier around and during the Spring Festival. According to statistics, passenger traffic will increase by about 60% compared with usual, and the highest daily increase will be about 100%. In terms of freight transport, in addition to the daily transport of materials, festival materials must also be rushed before the 20th. To this end, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau requires all employees to make a concentrated effort to complete the full month's tasks within ten days from the 11th to the 20th, and then launch a Spring Festival transport shock movement from January 20th to February 5th to ensure a complete victory for the Spring Festival.
    Strengthening collaboration and organizing joint actions are important guarantees for completing the transportation tasks before and after the Spring Festival. The railway department and coal, commerce, grain, transportation, and other departments have established a joint festival transportation office. Various offices and major stations have also formed corresponding organizations with factories and enterprises to uniformly command passenger and freight transport work. Before the 20th, we will vigorously organize the early transportation of coal and other major materials, and use the opportunity to transport a large number of festival materials. In order to do a good job in loading, unloading, and handling, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau plans to organize more than 34,000 family members of employees to form shock teams and reserve teams to move cargo positions, rush loading, and rush unloading. In recent days, all staff and workers of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau have launched a technical performance competition centered on the red flag train. Various offices and stations have strengthened dispatching and commanding work, improved station operations, and eliminated slow transport and broken hook accidents on many fronts. In the technical performance competition, various technical and economic indicators have been significantly improved. The turnaround time of freight cars in the first eleven days of January was more than 100 carloads less per day than the average in December last year. The daily travel time of freight cars at Taiyuan North Station has been shortened from 20 hours in January to 11.6 hours.

    春节以前，第一汽车厂职工的主要任务是围攻重点技术关。现在，厂级的二十多个“闯关队”，运用“放炮迎春”（即攻破技术关键迎接春节）的形式，在围攻二十三个重大技术关。底盘车间工人还创造出一种“赶集过春节”形式（即经验交流，传“经”取“宝”会），推广二百多项技术革新，提高设备能力，减低劳动强度。
    为确保春节开门红，各车间特别重视了安全生产，消灭重大人身及设备事故，并做好材料供应、设备维修、环境卫生等准备工作。春节期间，这个厂还将组织四个文艺演出队，去人民公社演出，同时组织几十个工人业余作者到公社访问，创作诗歌、快板、舞蹈等，歌颂党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社和工农联盟。
