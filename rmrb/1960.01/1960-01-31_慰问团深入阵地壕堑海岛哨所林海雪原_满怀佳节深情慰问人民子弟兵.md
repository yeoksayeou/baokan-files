    Xinhua News Agency, January 30th -- During the Spring Festival, Spring Festival慰问团慰问团 from various provinces and cities, representing people from all walks of life across the country, have been carrying out extensive and cordial慰问团慰问团 activities to the People's Liberation Army troops, People's Armed Police performing border defense tasks, and wounded and sick soldiers in various parts of the country.

    In the capital, the six sub-groups of the慰问团慰问团, led by Chen Peng, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, began visiting twenty-three hospitals and sanatoriums on the 21st, extending cordial greetings to the hospitalized wounded and sick soldiers and recuperating personnel of the People's Liberation Army. The Spring Festival慰问团慰问团 from all walks of life in Shanghai, led by Cao Diqiu, the head of the group, divided into eight routes on the 23rd to visit the wounded and sick soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police in various hospitals. Wherever they went, they went deep into the wards, warmly shook hands and talked with the wounded and sick soldiers, and presented them with慰问团慰问团 bags filled with various gifts. Many leading actors from professional theater troupes accompanied the慰问团慰问团 to the wards to perform brilliant programs for the wounded and sick soldiers.

    On the Fujian front and the Yunnan border, personnel from the慰问团慰问团 and dozens of theater troupes and film projection teams accompanying the慰问团慰问团 have been visiting the front lines, coastal islands, and many border garrisons in separate groups in recent days to carry out enthusiastic慰问团慰问团 activities. The Spring Festival慰问团慰问团 from all walks of life in Fujian Province, carrying a large number of consolation letters,慰问团慰问团 items, and films such as "Trial by Fire," "Song of Youth," and "Dawn on the River," spent the Spring Festival with the frontline officers and soldiers on the front lines and in the trenches. Representatives from all walks of life in the Longxi area rushed to Xiamen with gifts such as tangerines, oranges, and bananas to express their gratitude to the troops who vigorously supported the people of Longxi in fighting disasters and carrying out rescue operations in August and September last year. The people of Xiamen, who have a close friendship with the three services on the front lines in the struggle against the enemy and in production and construction, also went to various positions and warships during the festival to celebrate the New Year with the soldiers. The Spring Festival慰问团慰问团 from all walks of life in Yunnan Province, carrying a literary and artistic troupe composed of twenty-seven cultural groups, began a comprehensive慰问团慰问团 activity on the 26th in the border areas and along the railway lines,向驻军和正在修路的铁道兵部队展开全面的慰问活动。

    Spring Festival慰问团慰问团 from all walks of life and theater troupes and film projection teams accompanying the慰问团慰问团 in Nanjing, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Jinan, Hebei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia, led by local party and government leaders, brought慰问团慰问团 letters and gifts to the army, navy, and air force garrisons and the posts where they were on duty, to celebrate the Spring Festival with the officers and soldiers. Wherever they went, they held grand慰问团慰问团 meetings, forums, or get-togethers to report on the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward, thank the officers and soldiers for their enthusiastic support for the socialist construction in various places, and encourage all officers and soldiers to continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of the People's Army and achieve greater achievements in performing the glorious task of being both defenders and builders of the socialist cause of the motherland. In the snowy and cold Northeast, members of the慰问团慰问团 climbed snow-capped mountains and crossed glaciers to visit remote troops, striving to meet every soldier. The theater troupes and film projection teams of various慰问团慰问团s also worked tirelessly, going deep into the forests and snowfields or border and island outposts, to perform wonderful programs for the officers and soldiers.

    The cordial慰问团慰问团 from the people all over the country gave great encouragement to the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the wounded and sick soldiers. They wrote letters to the慰问团慰问团 in their own names and collectively, expressing their determination and will to defend the motherland and actively participate in socialist construction. Hu Dean, a heroic gunner who is recuperating at the Plastic Surgery Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said to the members of the慰问团慰问团: "The Party has given me a second life, and I will dedicate my life to the Party. When my hands regain their function, I will return to the front line to defend the motherland." The soldiers of the "Yang Lian Di Company" of the Railway Corps, who are building bridges in the Yunnan area, completed the construction task ten days ahead of schedule to thank their loved ones for their慰问团慰问团. The officers and soldiers transporting timber adopted the method of keeping the carts busy when the horses were idle, which doubled the work efficiency. Tang Tianyou, a new recruit in Jilin Province, was particularly excited to receive the慰问团慰问团 from the people of the motherland for the first time as a soldier. He said that he would listen to the Party, learn from the veteran soldiers, quickly master the skills to defend the motherland, and become an excellent national defense soldier. (Attached picture)
