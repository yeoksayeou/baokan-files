    Habits Can Be Changed
    Yefu
    Over the years, people have developed various habits in production and life. Some habits are good and scientifically sound, while others are unreasonable. Some habits appear to be scientific and reasonable, but are not entirely so. Those habits that are both unreasonable and unscientific should be changed and can be changed. This is especially important in production.

    For many years, 90% of the buildings in metallurgical factories have habitually used steel structures, and large-diameter water pipelines in metallurgical factories have habitually used steel or cast iron pipes. In the context of the continuous Great Leap Forward in metallurgical construction, some enterprises, by liberating their minds and engaging in technical revolution, have also changed the usual practices and found alternative materials. For example, the sintering plant recently put into production by Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation adopted a reinforced concrete structure, saving 2,400 tons of steel. According to past practice, this type of project would have to use steel structures. The most important projects in modern large-scale enterprises have successfully used concrete structures instead of steel structures, which shows that it is even less of a problem to use concrete structures extensively in general projects. For example, concrete has always been made of cement, sand, and gravel. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is vigorously promoting wet-ground slag concrete, which can save 50% to 60% of cement, or even eliminate the need for cement altogether. This is another example of changing habits.

    Some comrades are constrained by traditional habits. This phenomenon exists in the issue of materials in metallurgical construction. In fact, there has never been a fixed standard for what materials to use for construction. So-called traditional materials are only suitable under certain historical conditions. Looking back at the history of architecture, we can see that in ancient times, when there was no steel or cement, many buildings were made of stone or brick. Later, as production developed, steel and cement became available, and steel and cement were used as building materials. Now that science is more developed and more, better, and more economical new materials have been invented, we should of course promote new materials. The situation varies from region to region. In areas with abundant wood, wooden structures are used more often; in areas with abundant stone, stone structures are used more often; and in areas with abundant bamboo, bamboo structures are used more often. The working people have always chosen building materials according to the time and place. Whatever material is good, whatever material is abundant, and whatever material is cheap, that material is used for construction.

    Some people regard the promotion of new technologies and the use of new materials as an expedient measure, believing that new materials are never as good as traditional and commonly used materials. Since there is a shortage of steel and cement now, we have to make do with new materials. This view is wrong. We are not advocating the use of materials of lower quality, and steel must still be used where steel is required. The ten new technologies promoted by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry are China's new technologies and also the new development direction of building materials. New materials must replace old materials, which is the law of the development of things. Holding on to old habits and failing to see the vitality of new things is not in line with the spirit of the General Line and is not the attitude that revolutionaries should have.

    Liberating our minds, boldly innovating, breaking through the constraints of traditional habits, and adopting new building materials are good ways to develop China's construction industry.

    习惯是可以改变的
    野夫
    多少年来，人们在生产、生活中养成了各种各样的习惯。有些习惯是好的、合乎科学道理的，有些习惯则是不合理的，有些习惯看来是科学的合理的，其实是不尽科学不尽合理的。那些既不合理也不科学的习惯，应当改变也能够改变。这一点在生产中特别重要。
    冶金工厂的许多厂房，过去有90％都习惯于采用钢结构，冶金工厂的大口径输水管线也都习惯于用钢管或铸铁管。在冶金建设持续大跃进的情况下，有些企业解放了思想，大闹技术革命，也就改变了惯例，找到了代替的材料。例如最近武钢新投入生产的烧结厂采用了钢筋混凝土结构，就节约钢材两千四百吨。这类工程照过去的惯例是非用钢结构不可的。现代化的大洋企业中的最重要的工程都成功地用混凝土结构代替钢结构，这就说明在一般工程中大量采用混凝土结构更不成问题。又如混凝土，过去一直是用水泥、砂子、石子配成的。冶金工业部大量推广湿碾矿渣混凝土，可以节约百分之五、六十水泥，甚至完全不用水泥。这也是改变习惯的一例。
    有一些同志，受到传统习惯的束缚。冶金建筑中的材料问题就有这种现象。其实，建设用什么材料，从来也没有固定不变的标准。所谓传统材料都不过是在一定的历史条件下适用而已。翻开建筑史，我们可以看到，古代没有钢材水泥的时候，许多建筑都是用石料或砖来造的，后来生产发展了，有了钢材与水泥，才使用钢材、水泥作建筑材料。现在科学更发展了，发明了更多、更好、更省的新材料，我们当然就应该提倡新材料。各地区的情况也不一样，木材多的地方，多用木结构，石材多的地方，多用石结构，竹材多的地方，多用竹结构。劳动人民向来是因时制宜、因地制宜来选择建筑材料的。什么材料好，什么材料多，什么材料便宜，就使用什么材料来建筑。
    有人把推广新技术、使用新材料看作权宜之计，认为新材料总比不上传统惯用的材料好，现在钢材、水泥不足，只好将就使用新材料。这种看法是错误的。我们并不是提倡使用质量较低的材料，必须用钢材的地方还是要用钢材。冶金部推广的十项新技术，是我国的新技术，也是目前建筑材料的新发展方向。新材料一定要代替旧材料，这是事物的发展规律。抱住旧习惯不放，看不见新事物的生命力，这是不符合总路线的精神，不是革命者应有的态度。
    解放思想，大胆革新，突破传统习惯的束缚，采用新的建筑材料，是发展我国建筑事业的好办法。
