    The Development of National Democratic Movements in Latin America Over the Past Year
    Zhang Ye
    1959 was a year of continued upsurge in the national democratic movement in Latin America. A series of historically significant events occurred in Latin America during this year, indicating that the Latin American national democratic movement is entering a new historical period with unprecedented momentum.
    After a heroic struggle, the Cuban people overthrew the Batista dictatorial regime, which was fostered by the United States, at the beginning of the year, and established their own nationally independent government. This was the most significant victory in the struggle of the Latin American people for national independence and democratic freedom in recent years, and also the most serious failure in the history of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Latin America. Over the past year, the Cuban people have made many efforts to defend the achievements of the revolution and national sovereignty, to smash the United States' subversive conspiracies, to suppress counter-revolutionary criminals, to purge revolutionary traitors, and to implement land reform and develop a diversified economy.
    The victory and continued development of the Cuban Revolution greatly encouraged and promoted the struggle of the people in Latin American countries that are still under the rule of dictatorial regimes. The unprecedented upsurge and the widespread adoption of armed struggle in the anti-dictatorial struggles of the people in these countries is a prominent feature of the Latin American national democratic movement this year. The armed struggle launched by Nicaraguan patriots, with the support of the people, has waged a resolute struggle against the Somoza dictatorial regime. This struggle is continuing and developing. The anti-dictatorial armed struggle that broke out in the Dominican Republic on June 14 is also constantly growing, and has established two base areas in Constanza in the central region and in the mountainous area of Puerto Plata province in the north. The Paraguayan anti-dictatorial armed struggle that broke out on December 12, after inflicting heavy blows on the Stroessner dictatorial army, has moved into the mountains to carry out guerrilla activities. The progress of the armed struggles against dictatorial regimes in these countries has promoted a general increase in the people's dissatisfaction with the dictatorial governments, making the internal difficulties of the dictatorial regimes heavy, and they are in danger of collapsing at any time. Because the United States has always regarded dictatorial regimes as the pillar of its rule over Latin America, this is also a serious blow to U.S. imperialism.
    The spearhead of the Latin American national democratic movement is directly aimed at the United States. This is because the United States has always regarded Latin America as its "backyard," and has strictly controlled and cruelly exploited the countries, causing the economies of the countries to suffer cruel plunder, the political situation to be frequently turbulent, and the people's lives to be very painful, arousing the struggle of the Latin American people for national independence and against U.S. colonialists. In this year, the Cuban people stood on the front line of the struggle against U.S. imperialism, and held three million-person demonstrations on January 21, July 26, and October 26 respectively, to oppose the United States' attempts to subvert the Cuban revolutionary government. The Bolivian people held a 10,000-person anti-U.S. demonstration on March 2 to protest the insult of Bolivia by the U.S. magazine "Time." On August 2 and November 4, two demonstrations against the U.S. occupation broke out in Puerto Rico, a U.S. colony. On November 3, 4, 5, and 28, in Panama, where the United States has stationed heavy troops, continuous anti-U.S. demonstrations were held demanding the return of the Panama Canal and the Canal Zone, and they once rushed into the U.S.-occupied Canal Zone and planted the Panamanian flag. The Panamanian National Assembly also officially passed a resolution on November 9 to demand the return of the Canal and the Canal Zone.
    Another important manifestation of the upsurge in the anti-U.S. struggle in Latin America is that the contradictions between Latin American countries and U.S. imperialism are growing, and the governments of many countries, at the request of the masses of the people, have taken some protective measures in the economy, which have hit the plunder of U.S. monopoly capital. The most prominent event is that the Cuban Land Reform Committee, in accordance with the Land Reform Law, took over and will continue to take over the land occupied by U.S. companies in Cuba, and promulgated the Mining Law and the Petroleum Law, which directly hit U.S. monopoly capital. The Venezuelan government requisitioned 10,000 hectares of land in Suria State owned by the U.S. United Fruit Company, and announced that it would no longer grant new concessions to foreign oil companies and refused to accept loans from the United States. The Brazilian government refused to continue loan negotiations with the "International Monetary Fund" controlled by the United States, and requisitioned the power equipment of two local companies of the U.S. "Electric Power Securities Corporation" and four foreign meat refrigeration companies, three of which belonged to U.S. capital and one to British capital. The Colombian government announced the abolition of the contract signed with the U.S. oil company. The Peruvian House of Representatives passed a resolution demanding that the government drive the U.S. Texaco company out of Peru. The Argentine working people have continuously held strikes and demonstrations to defend the country's oil resources and oppose the government's acceptance of the "Economic Stabilization Plan" formulated by the United States. Mexico abolished the concession of a U.S. company to mine sulfur.
    Under the pressure of the United States, many countries in Latin America are often forced to succumb to the United States in their foreign policies. However, in the past year, Latin American countries have also begun to show a tendency toward independence in diplomacy. The prominent manifestation is that the Latin American group of voting machines in the United Nations is not as effective as it used to be. Only four years ago, U.S. diplomatic officials arrogantly asserted that "every Latin American country's voice is our voice." And what about four years later in 1959? The "New York Times," in analyzing the election of non-permanent members of the Security Council—Poland and Turkey—complained about Latin American countries. The newspaper said that they expected Turkey, supported by the United States, "to receive the approval of all twenty Latin American countries"; however, according to the newspaper's statistics, at least eight Latin American countries did not follow the United States in voting for Turkey in each vote, but voted for Poland.
    The United States has not only lost the support of some Latin American countries in the United Nations, but also cannot arbitrarily manipulate Latin American countries in the "Organization of American States" that it established. The most significant example is that the meeting of the Ministers of Interior of the six Central American countries held in early June rejected the proposal put forward by the Guatemalan Minister of Interior under the instigation of the United States to establish an "international police force." At the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the twenty-one American countries held in August, the United States' attempt to use the collective power of the "Organization of American States" to interfere in Cuba's conspiracy failed. These facts fully show that the United States is no longer so comfortable in arbitrarily manipulating the diplomatic affairs of Latin American countries.
    Over the past year, the struggle of Latin American peasants against the feudal hacienda system and demanding land reform has also made significant progress. The land issue is a common problem that peasants in Latin American countries urgently need to solve. The hacienda system is an important pillar for U.S. imperialism to control and plunder the agricultural economies of Latin American countries. To this day, the hacienda owners and foreign (mainly U.S.) monopoly capital still occupy more than two-thirds of the cultivated land in Latin America. Peasants account for 70% of the total population of Latin America, but more than 70% of farmers are landless tenants, while the 2,000 monopoly enterprises of U.S. monopoly capital in Latin America are the largest landowners in Latin America. For example, the United Fruit Company, known as the "Green Devil," occupies 2.5 million hectares of land in eight countries in Central and South America. In Cuba, 75% of the fertile land in the country is in the hands of U.S. companies. In Brazil, Mobil Oil and other U.S. monopoly organizations have obtained concessions for more than 4.8 million hectares of land. Therefore, the land issue in Latin American countries is actually the issue of these countries' agricultural economies breaking away from U.S. control and oppression. Over the past year, the Cuban people have resolutely carried out land reform work despite the U.S.'s tyrannical interference. As of December 3, they had taken over 65,000 caballerías (one caballería equals 201.45 Chinese mu) of land from 575 large haciendas, many of which belonged to U.S. monopoly capital.
    Like the victory of the Cuban Revolution, the Cuban land reform shook the entire Latin America and promoted the struggle of peasants in this region for land. The Venezuelan parliament discussed a draft land reform law in July, and the Costa Rican parliament passed a general principle in September that should be implemented in the land law to be promulgated in 1960. The anti-dictatorial armies and united front organizations in Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Paraguay have all made the implementation of land reform a major item in their struggle programs. Struggles for peasants to seize land have also occurred in Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil.
    Under this situation, the peasant movement in many countries has made new progress. Peasants or agricultural workers in Cuba, Venezuela, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia, and other countries have begun to organize.
    In the vigorously developing national democratic movement, the Latin American working class has become an independent and important political force. Its vanguard—the Communist Party—has won the heartfelt support of the broad masses of the people in various countries in the struggle. The Communist Parties of many countries have achieved legal status through struggle. At present, the parties of only eight countries are in an illegal state, mostly some countries where the United States has tighter control. The political programs of the parties of all countries have determined that the social nature of Latin American countries is semi-feudal and semi-colonial, and the revolutionary task at the present stage is to complete the bourgeois national democratic revolution. The Communist Parties of all countries stand at the forefront of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle and fight the most resolutely against U.S. imperialism and its agents. In the struggle, the unity of the working class in various countries is being strengthened. Argentina's two major trade union organizations—the "Sixty-Two Trade Unions" and the "Trade Union Unity Movement"—and other independent trade unions have established the unified "United Labor Movement" and formulated a common struggle program. Trade union organizations in Venezuela, Cuba, Chile, Brazil, and Colombia have all held conferences under the slogan of unity and unification. Peru has established a unified center organization for the working people, Venezuela has established a federation of trade unions, and the Chilean Workers' United Trade Union has decided to strengthen unity in the struggle. Trade union activists in some Latin American countries have proposed the establishment of a Latin American General Confederation of Trade Unions, which has been supported by trade union organizations in many countries.
    Due to the strengthening of the unity of the working class, the strike movement in Latin America this year has been unprecedentedly high, and the scale is grand, the momentum is huge, and demonstrations, marches, strikes, and class boycotts involve tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of people. In many countries such as Chile, Puerto Rico, and Colombia, the spearhead of the strike struggle is directly aimed at U.S. monopoly capital. The growth of the strength of the Latin American working class is an important guarantee for the inevitable victory of the struggle of the people of Latin American countries for independence and democracy.
    Under the promotion of the Communist Parties and progressive forces of various countries, the united front of the people of various Latin American countries against imperialism and feudalism and the unity between countries have been further strengthened. In the struggle surrounding intervention in and anti-intervention in the Cuban Revolution, the unity and mutual support of the people of various Latin American countries have been greatly strengthened. A mass movement centered on defending the Cuban Revolution and opposing U.S. interference has been launched in Latin America, and some countries have established permanent organizations to defend the Cuban Revolution. This solidarity, known as "Latin Americanism," strongly supported Cuba and cracked down on the conspiracy activities of U.S. interventionists. In addition, anti-dictatorial united fronts, including the Communist Party, have been established in the three remaining dictatorial countries. The united front organizations of these three countries have also established formal contacts and formed the "American People's Alliance Against Tyrants" in order to cooperate and support each other in the anti-dictatorial struggle.
    The great achievements made by the Latin American national democratic movement powerfully demonstrate the unprecedented awakening of the Latin American people, and the future of Latin America is full of light. Although the struggle will be tortuous and complex, and U.S. imperialism and its pawns—the reactionary forces of various countries—are unwilling to easily withdraw from the stage, and there are still some negative factors temporarily existing within the people of various countries, the overall situation in Latin America and the world is favorable to the Latin American people who are striving for independence and freedom. In 1960, the Latin American national democratic movement will continue to rise, and any conspiracies and tricks of U.S. imperialism and its agents cannot stop this rolling historical torrent.

    拉丁美洲一年来民族民主运动的发展
    章叶
    1959年是拉丁美洲民族民主运动继续高涨的一年。这一年中，在拉丁美洲发生了一系列具有重大历史意义的事件，表明拉丁美洲民族民主运动正以空前浩大的声势，进入了一个新的历史时期。
    古巴人民经过英勇的斗争，在年初推翻了美国一手扶植的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权，并建立了自己的民族独立的政府，这是近年来拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立和民主自由斗争的最重大的一次胜利，也是美帝国主义侵略拉丁美洲历史上最严重的一次失败。一年来，古巴人民在保卫革命成果和国家主权，粉碎美国的颠复阴谋，镇压反革命罪犯，清洗革命叛徒，以及实行土地改革，发展多种经济等方面作了许多努力。
    古巴革命的胜利和继续发展，大大鼓舞和推动了拉丁美洲那些仍处在独裁政权统治下的国家人民的斗争。这些国家人民反独裁斗争的空前高涨和普遍采取武装斗争的形式，是今年拉丁美洲民族民主运动的突出特点。尼加拉瓜爱国者发动的武装斗争，在人民的支持下，对索摩查独裁政权展开了坚决的斗争。这个斗争正继续坚持和发展中。6月14日，在多米尼加爆发的反独裁武装斗争，也在不断壮大，并在中部康斯坦萨和北部普拉港省山区建立了两个根据地。12月12日爆发的巴拉圭反独裁武装斗争，在给斯特罗斯纳独裁军队以沉重打击后，已转入山区进行游击活动。这些国家反对独裁政权的武装斗争的进展，促进了各国人民对独裁政府的不满情绪普遍增长，使各独裁政权内部困难重重，随时都有倒台的危险。由于美国一向把独裁政权作为它统治拉丁美洲的支柱，这也是对美帝国主义的严重打击。
    拉丁美洲民族民主运动的矛头，是直接指向美国的。这是因为美国一向把拉丁美洲当作自己的“后院”，对各国进行严格的控制和残酷的剥削，使各国的经济遭受残酷掠夺，政治局势经常动荡不安，人民生活十分痛苦，激起了拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立、反对美国殖民主义者的斗争。在这一年中，古巴人民站在反对美帝国主义斗争的前线，分别在1月21日、7月26日、10月26日举行了三次一百万人的大示威，反对美国企图颠复古巴革命政府的活动。玻利维亚人民在3月2日举行了一万人的反美大示威，抗议美国“时代”杂志对玻利维亚的侮辱。8月2日和11月4日，在美国殖民地的波多黎各爆发了两次反对美国占领的示威。11月3日、4日、5日和28日，在美国驻有重兵的巴拿马，连续举行了要求收回巴拿马运河和运河区的反美大示威，并且曾经冲入美国霸占的运河区，插上巴拿马国旗。巴拿马国民议会也在11月9日正式通过一定要收回运河和运河区的决议。
    拉丁美洲反美斗争高涨的另一重要表现是，拉丁美洲国家同美帝国主义的矛盾日益增长，许多国家的政府在人民群众的要求下，在经济上采取了一些保护性的措施，使美国垄断资本的掠夺遭到了打击。最突出的事件是，古巴土地改革委员会根据土地改革法接管了并将继续接管美国公司在古巴占有的土地，颁布了直接打击美国垄断资本的矿业法和石油法。委内瑞拉政府征用了美国联合果品公司在苏里亚州的一万公顷土地，并宣布不再给予外国石油公司新的租让权和拒绝接受美国的贷款。巴西政府拒绝了同美国控制的“国际货币基金组织”继续进行贷款谈判，并征用了美商“电力证券股份公司”两个地方公司的电力设备和四家外国肉类冷藏公司，其中三家属于美国资本，一家属于英国资本。哥伦比亚政府宣布废除同美国石油公司签订的合同。秘鲁众议院通过要求政府把美国德士古公司赶出秘鲁的决议。阿根廷的劳动人民连续不断地为保卫国家石油资源和反对政府接受美国制定的“稳定经济计划”而举行罢工和示威。墨西哥废除了一家美国公司开采硫磺的租让权。
    在美国的压力下，拉丁美洲不少国家在外交政策方面经常是被迫屈从于美国的。但是，在过去的一年中，拉丁美洲国家在外交上也开始出现了独立的倾向。突出的表现是，美国在联合国内的拉丁美洲集团表决机器不像过去那样灵验了。还只不过是在四年以前，美国外交官员们曾狂妄地断言，“每一个拉丁美洲国家的声音都是我们的声音”。而在四年后的1959年呢？“纽约时报”在分析选举安全理事会非常任理事国——波兰和土耳其的时候，却抱怨起拉丁美洲国家来了。这家报纸说，他们预期美国所支持的土耳其“将得到所有二十个拉丁美洲国家的赞成”；但是，据报纸统计，在每次投票时至少有八个拉丁美洲国家没有跟随美国一起投土耳其的票，而投票赞成波兰。
    美国不仅失去了联合国中的某些拉丁美洲国家的支持，就是在它一手建立的“美洲国家组织”中，也不能任意摆布拉丁美洲国家了。最显著的例证是，6月初举行的中美洲六国内政部长会议，否决了由美国指使危地马拉内政部长提出建立一支“国际警察部队”的建议。在8月举行的美洲二十一国外长会议上，美国企图利用“美洲国家组织”的集体力量来干涉古巴的阴谋未能得逞。这些事实充分说明，美国任意摆布拉丁美洲国家外交事务已经不那么得心应手了。
    一年来，拉丁美洲农民反对封建大庄园制和要求实行土地改革的斗争，也有了显著的发展。土地问题是拉丁美洲各国农民迫切要求解决的共同问题。大庄园制是美帝国主义控制和掠夺拉丁美洲各国农业经济的重要支柱。直到今天，大庄园主和外国（主要是美国）垄断资本仍占有拉丁美洲三分之二以上的耕地。农民占拉丁美洲总人口的70％，但70％以上的农户是无地的佃农，而美国垄断资本在拉丁美洲的二千家垄断企业，却是拉丁美洲最大的土地所有者。例如，被称为“绿色魔鬼”的联合果品公司，在中南美八个国家就占有土地二百五十万公顷。在古巴，全国75％的肥沃土地都掌握在美国公司手中。在巴西，美孚油公司和其他美国垄断组织获得四百八十多万公顷土地的租让权。因此，拉丁美洲各国的土地问题，实际上是这些国家农业经济摆脱美国控制和压榨的问题。一年来，古巴人民不顾美国的横暴干涉，坚决进行土地改革工作。到12月3日为止，已经接管了五百七十五个大庄园的六万五千多卡瓦耶里亚（一卡瓦耶里亚等于二百零一点四五中国亩）的土地，其中有不少是属于美国垄断资本的。
    和古巴革命的胜利一样，古巴的土地改革震动了整个拉丁美洲，并推动了这一地区农民争取土地的斗争。委内瑞拉议会在7月间讨论了土地改革法草案，哥斯达黎加议会在9月间通过一项将于1960年颁布的土地法应贯彻执行的一般原则。尼加拉瓜、多米尼加、巴拉圭的反独裁军和统一战线组织，都把实行土地改革作为斗争纲领的主要项目。哥伦比亚、墨西哥、委内瑞拉和巴西还发生了农民夺取土地的斗争。
    在这种形势下，许多国家的农民运动有了新的发展。古巴、委内瑞拉、阿根廷、智利、秘鲁、哥伦比亚等国的农民或农业工人都已开始组织起来。
    在蓬勃发展的民族民主运动中，拉丁美洲工人阶级已经成为一支独立的重要政治力量。它的先锋队——共产党在斗争中得到了各国广大人民的衷心拥护。许多国家的共产党经过斗争都取得了合法地位，目前只有八个国家的党处于非法状态，多半是美国控制较紧的一些国家。各国党的政纲都确定拉丁美洲国家的社会性质是半封建和半殖民地的，现阶段的革命任务是完成资产阶级民族民主革命。各国共产党站在反帝反封建斗争的最前列，同美帝国主义及其代理人斗争得最坚决。在斗争中，各国工人阶级的团结正在加强。阿根廷两大主要工会组织——“六十二工会”和“工会团结运动”和其他独立工会，成立了统一的“联合劳工运动”，制定了共同的斗争纲领。委内瑞拉、古巴、智利、巴西和哥伦比亚的工会组织都在团结统一的口号下举行了大会。秘鲁成立了劳动人民统一中心组织，委内瑞拉成立了工会联合会，智利工人统一工会决定在斗争中加强团结。拉丁美洲一些国家的工会活动家提出建立拉丁美洲总工会的建议，得到许多国家工会组织的支持。
    由于工人阶级的团结加强了，在这一年中拉丁美洲的罢工运动空前高涨，而且规模壮阔，声势浩大，示威、游行、罢工、罢课动辄几万、几十万乃至几百万人参加。在智利、波多黎各、哥伦比亚等许多国家，罢工斗争的锋芒直接指向美国垄断资本。拉丁美洲工人阶级力量的壮大，是拉丁美洲各国人民争取独立和民主的斗争必然获得胜利的重要保证。
    在各国共产党和进步力量的推动下，拉丁美洲各国人民反帝反封建的统一战线和各国之间的团结，有了进一步的加强。在围绕着对古巴革命的干涉和反干涉的斗争，拉丁美洲各国人民的团结和互相支援大大地加强起来。在拉丁美洲已经掀起了一个以保卫古巴革命和反对美国干涉为中心的群众运动，有些国家并成立了保卫古巴革命的永久性组织。这种被称为“拉丁美洲主义”的团结，有力地支持了古巴，打击了美国干涉者的阴谋活动。此外，在三个残存的独裁国家中，都已建立了包括共产党在内的反独裁统一战线。这三个国家的统一战线组织还建立了正式的联系，成立了“美洲人民反对暴君联盟”，以便在反独裁斗争中合作和互相支援。
    拉丁美洲民族民主运动所取得的伟大成就，有力地表明了拉丁美洲人民的空前觉醒，拉丁美洲的前途充满了光明。尽管斗争还会是曲折和复杂的，美帝国主义及其走狗——各国的反动势力不肯轻易退出舞台，各国人民内部也还暂时存在着某些消极的因素，但是拉丁美洲和世界的总的形势是有利于争取独立自由的拉丁美洲人民的。在1960年，拉丁美洲民族民主运动必将继续高涨，美帝国主义及其代理人的任何阴谋诡计，都无法阻挡这个滚滚向前的历史巨流。
