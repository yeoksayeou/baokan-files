Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th - According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio today, the Lao Royal Palace Office announced today that Lao King Savang Vatthana has appointed Kou Abhay, President of the Privy Council, as Prime Minister of the Lao "Provisional Government." Within this ten-member cabinet, the individuals holding key power are members of the ultra-pro-American "Committee for the Defence of National Interests," including Defence Minister Phoumi Nosavan, Foreign Minister Khamphan Panya, and Finance and Economy Minister Loun Lasasombath.

The communique stated that this "Provisional Government" will prepare for general elections.

The ultra-pro-American Lao "Committee for the Defence of National Interests" and the heads of the Royal Armed Forces forcibly compelled the Lao Phoui Sananikone cabinet to resign and dissolved the National Assembly a few days ago.

Vientiane Radio also announced today that the Lao Royal Armed Forces Headquarters has designated the members of the General Secretariat responsible for unified management of government ministries, with Phung Phungdeth as Secretary-General.

The radio broadcast stated that the Lao Royal Armed Forces Headquarters has issued instructions to the governors of Lao provinces stating that "during the period when the General Headquarters undertakes the task of governing the country, all provinces are placed under the leadership of the army, and all work is decided by the General Headquarters." The instructions also required the governors to "strengthen the surveillance and suppression" of so-called "elements and organizations that take advantage of the current situation to create chaos for the country."

    老挝成立“临时政府”
    实权握在亲美军阀分子手中
    新华社河内7日电　据万象电台今天广播，老挝王庭办公厅今天发表公报说，老挝国王萨旺·瓦达纳今天已经任命以枢密院院长古·阿派为首相的老挝“临时政府”。在这个十人内阁中，掌握主要实权的是极端亲美的“保卫国家利益委员会”分子，他们包括国防大臣富米·诺萨万，外交大臣坎番·班雅，财政经济大臣鸾·拉沙森巴。
    公报说，这个“临时政府”将筹备大选。
    极端亲美的老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”和王国军队的首脑们前几天用武力迫使老挝培·萨纳尼空内阁辞职，并且解散了国会。
    万象电台今天还宣布，老挝王国军队总司令部已经指定了负责统一管辖政府各部事务的总秘书处的成员，由冯非特担任秘书长。
    电台广播说，老挝王国军队总司令部已经向老挝各省省长发出指令说，在总司令部承担统治国家任务的期间“各省都置于军队领导下，一切工作都由总司令部决定”。指令还要求各省长“加强监视和镇压”所谓“利用当前时机为国家制造混乱的分子和组织”。
