Studying Comrade Mao Zedong's Writings
Wu Zhipu, First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Comrades of Party organizations at all levels in Henan and all cadres attach importance to Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and their studies have been fruitful. Comrades on all work fronts in the province can conscientiously implement the Party's General Line, and many comrades can gradually improve their theoretical level and work methods. This is good proof. Especially after the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification movement in 1957, and after the anti-Rightist, all-out effort, and vigorous increase production and practice economy movement in 1959, the understanding and mastery of Mao Zedong Thought by comrades in Henan has greatly advanced.

However, from the perspective of current needs and strict requirements, many comrades have not studied Comrade Mao Zedong's works carefully and systematically enough. Therefore, they cannot well grasp this theoretical weapon of Marxism-Leninism, which Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied based on China's specific practice, and cannot train themselves to wield this weapon skillfully and freely. Some comrades, because of their low theoretical level, shallow roots, thin foundation, and unstable footing, can only execute the Party's line, principles, and policies relatively well in normal and smooth environments, step by step. Once they encounter relatively large adverse currents and "typhoons," they will be swayed and even lose their direction. Not to mention distant events, taking recent years as an example, after the high tide of cooperativization in 1956, when bourgeois Rightists frantically attacked the Party in 1957, some comrades wavered. Some were weak and powerless in the face of the struggle; some even became prisoners of the Rightists. In 1958, the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes achieved brilliant successes, but when Right-leaning opportunists within the Party launched an attack in 1959, some comrades wavered again, failing to draw clear lines on major issues of right and wrong, and some even echoed the Right-leaning opportunists. These comrades can only follow the Party's correct line when things are smooth. When they encounter critical junctures, that is, when class struggle is acute or when there is a major turn in the political situation, precisely when comrades who bear leadership responsibilities need to clearly distinguish the direction and steer the ship, they become confused in their thinking, waver in their positions, and become weak and powerless in their attitude. Not only can they not act as pillars in the torrent, but they even run with the adverse current. This is very dangerous for the Party's cause. Of course, such comrades are few in number within our Party. There are also many comrades who, although they can generally see the correct direction and can basically stand firm and withstand relatively large adverse currents and "typhoons," cannot accurately grasp the measure and timing. Sometimes they go a little too far, sometimes they fall a little short, sometimes they are hot-headed, and sometimes they are cold-headed. Some small deviations and individual local errors occur constantly in their work. Although this situation is difficult to completely avoid, and shortcomings and errors are only one finger out of ten, we must not be satisfied with this and should strive to continuously improve our political and ideological level. It is, of course, impossible to ask that no mistakes be made, but we should try as much as possible not to make mistakes, to make fewer mistakes, and not to make big mistakes. This is the correct attitude that Marxists-Leninists should have. Among the majority of comrades in Henan, there is a more widespread situation: they feel busy every day, even working non-stop day and night for short periods. This spirit of selfless work for the Party and the people is, of course, very valuable. However, because they have not studied Comrade Mao Zedong's works enough and their theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism is not high, although they have worked hard and achieved great success, their ideological level remains at the stage of fragmented experience. They cannot explain the reasons for their work, cannot grasp the regularity, and cannot elevate their work to principles. Therefore, although they have accumulated a lot of experience in many years of work, their improvement is very slow, and they cannot systematize their experience and raise it to the level of theory. Thus, it is difficult to improve work efficiency and theoretical level more quickly.

The several situations mentioned above show that there are still many problems in leadership work at all levels. These situations have occurred or exist in many comrades. Wavering in big storms, constantly making some temporary and local errors in work, and the widespread existence of empiricism and practicalism are all concrete manifestations of insufficient study of Marxist-Leninist works, especially insufficient study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works.

In the earth-shaking revolutionary struggles of China over the past few decades, Comrade Mao Zedong has demonstrated his outstanding and firm Marxist-Leninist stance, his lofty and fearless communist style, and his far-sighted scientific foresight whenever the revolutionary situation entered a major turning point, or when the revolutionary struggle encountered difficulties and the situation was very dangerous, or when the revolution entered a new high tide. Countless historical facts prove that Comrade Mao Zedong is a great Marxist theorist who has been tempered in numerous struggles, and the great helmsman of the Chinese revolution. He can correctly lead the Chinese people to advance victoriously in any storm. Mao Zedong Thought is the most complete embodiment of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong's works are the creatively developed Marxism-Leninism in the period of the democratic revolution, the socialist revolution, and socialist construction. They are the criteria for all our work. Everything we do in revolution and construction according to Comrade Mao Zedong's thought will surely be victorious; everything that violates Comrade Mao Zedong's thought will surely fail. This is an irrefutable truth.

Now, our country is carrying out socialist construction at a high speed. The development of the Great Leap Forward is advancing rapidly, and many comrades deeply feel that their thinking cannot keep up with the development of the situation. In order to ensure that our country is rapidly built into a great socialist country, we must conscientiously and systematically study Comrade Mao Zedong's works and further improve our ideological level.

Comrade Mao Zedong's works are numerous and very rich in content, including theories and doctrines in various fields. To sum up, Comrade Mao Zedong's works can be divided into the following categories: on the Marxist-Leninist world outlook and methodology; on the basic theory of revolution and the Party's political line; on the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat; on the theory of the peasant question; on the theory of the revolutionary united front; on the theory of establishing revolutionary base areas; on the theory of socialist economic construction; on the theory of war and strategy; on the theory of imperialism; on the theory of the international communist movement; on the theory of culture and art; on the theory of Party building.

All of Comrade Mao Zedong's works must be systematically studied and repeatedly researched by us. At present, we must first study Comrade Mao Zedong's theories on world outlook and methodology, such as "On Contradiction," "On Practice," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Rectify Our Style of Learning," "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," "Preface and Postscript to Rural Surveys," and other relevant works and speeches on these most important and fundamental theoretical issues. At the same time, in order to study and grasp the laws of socialist construction and accelerate the cause of socialist construction, we must study Comrade Mao Zedong's theories on socialist economic construction. In particular, the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction is a concentrated expression of Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of socialist economics. We must deeply understand the content of the General Line theoretically and fully comprehend the spirit of the General Line. We must also study well Comrade Mao Zedong's theories on the dictatorship of the proletariat and class struggle, his analyses of the international situation and the international communist movement, and his thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

To study Comrade Mao Zedong's works well, we must also have correct study methods. First, we must study systematically, repeatedly, and deeply, and truly understand the spirit and essence of Comrade Mao Zedong's works. Some works should be read several times a year, some should be read several times a month, and some should be used as manuals, as mottoes, read frequently, read every day, read them thoroughly. Second, we must study in combination with practice. The purpose of our study is not for the sake of study, but for the needs of work, and for solving practical problems. Therefore, we must learn and do at the same time, learn and apply at the same time, and combine theory with practice. Third, we must use our brains, think while reading, think deeply, and study hard. We must not only read thoroughly, but also digest it. Fourth, we must not only read and think, but also write articles. We must constantly study and summarize our work according to Mao Zedong Thought, raise the experience of practical work to theoretical principles, draw scientific conclusions, and write articles that have both practical materials and theoretical analysis. In this way, we will better connect with reality and learn more deeply. Fifth, while studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, we should combine them with the study of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. For example, when studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works on world outlook and methodology, we can combine them with the study of Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" and "Philosophical Notebooks," etc. To sum up, the method of learning is to read accurately, think clearly, do effectively, and write articulately.

Comrade Mao Zedong is very concerned about the theoretical study of cadres, and often patiently guides us, earnestly hoping that leading comrades at all levels will become true Marxists. We must not disappoint Comrade Mao Zedong's hopes. Comrades in Henan, especially leading comrades of Party committees at all levels, must regard the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works as their top priority. In this way, we can not only study well, but also do our work better and complete the tasks entrusted to us by the Party and the people happily and competently.

As the great year of 1960 arrives, I hope that comrades in Henan and all cadres will set off a high tide of studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works in the new year, thereby continuously improving our Marxist-Leninist theoretical level.

### 学习毛泽东同志的著作

    学习毛泽东同志的著作
    中共河南省委第一书记　吴芝圃
    河南的各级党组织同志们和全体干部，对毛泽东同志的著作都是重视的，学习也是有成绩的。全省各个工作战线上的同志都能认真地贯彻执行党的总路线，许多同志都能逐步提高理论水平和改进工作方法，这就是很好的证明。特别是经过1957年的反右派斗争和整风运动，经过1959年反右倾、鼓干劲、开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，河南的同志们对毛泽东同志的思想的领会和掌握更大大前进了一步。
    但是，从当前的需要和严格的要求说来，许多同志对毛泽东同志的著作，认真地系统地学习还不够，因而就不能很好地掌握这个由毛泽东同志根据中国具体实践创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的理论武器，并且把这种武器操练纯熟，运用自如。有些同志因为理论水平低，根基浅，底子薄，脚跟站不牢，只能够在正常的顺利的环境中，按部就班地比较好地执行党的路线、方针和政策；一旦遇到比较大的逆流和“台风”的时候，就会东倒西歪，甚至迷失方向。远的不说了，就以最近几年为例，在1956年合作化高潮以后，1957年资产阶级右派向党猖狂进攻的时候，有些同志就动摇了，有的在斗争面前表现软弱无力；有的甚至成了右派的俘虏。1958年总路线、大跃进、人民公社取得了辉煌成就，但是在1959年党内的右倾机会主义分子发动进攻的时候，有的同志又动摇了，在大是大非的问题面前划不清界限，有的还跟着右倾机会主义分子叫嚷。这些同志，只能在顺利的时候跟着党的正确路线走，一遇到紧要关头，也就是遇到阶级斗争尖锐，或者是政治形势有大的转折的时候，正需要担负领导工作的同志能够清楚地辨别方向、掌握船舵的时候，他们反而在思想上混乱，立场上动摇，态度上软弱无力；不但不能作中流砥柱，甚至跟着逆流跑。这对党的事业是非常危险的。当然，像这种同志，在我们党内为数很少。还有许多同志，他们虽然对大的方向一般地能够看得准，在遇到比较大的逆流和“台风”的时候，也基本上能够站得稳，顶得住，但不能恰如其分地准确地掌握分寸和火候。有时候走的过了一点，有时候又有些不及，有时候头脑偏热，有时候头脑偏冷；在工作上不断地发生一些小的偏差和个别的局部性的错误。这种情形虽然难于完全避免，缺点与错误也只是十个指头中的一个指头的问题，但是我们决不能以此为满足，而应该力争不断提高自己的政治思想水平。要求丝毫不犯错误，固然是不可能的，但应该尽可能作到不犯错误、少犯错误和不犯大的错误，这是马克思列宁主义者应有的正确态度。河南大多数同志中间，还更加普遍地存在着这种情况：天天感到忙忙碌碌，甚至在短时间内整天整夜的不眠不休，这种为党为人民忘我地工作的精神，自然是非常可贵的。可是，由于对毛泽东同志的著作学得不够，马克思列宁主义的理论水平不高，虽然辛辛苦苦地作了很多工作，取得了很大成绩，思想水平却停留在零碎的经验阶段，对自己作的工作，说不出所以然，摸不到规律性，不能提高到原则上来总结自己的工作。因而，虽然在多年工作中间积累了很多经验，但提高得很慢，不能使经验系统化，并上升到理论的高度。这样，也就很难使工作效率和理论水平更快地提高。
    上面所说的几种情况，说明各级领导工作还存在不少问题。这几种情况，在许多同志的身上都发生过或存在着。在大风浪中表现动摇，在工作中不断发生一些这样或那样的暂时性、局部性的错误，以及经验主义和事务主义的普遍存在，都是对马克思列宁主义的著作学习不够，尤其是对毛泽东同志的著作学习不够的具体表现。
    毛泽东同志在中国几十年来的翻天复地的革命斗争中，每当革命形势进入了大的转折的时候，或者革命斗争遇到了困难，形势非常危险的紧要关头，或者是在革命进入新的高潮的时候，都表现出了他的杰出的坚定的马克思列宁主义的立场，表现出了他的崇高的大无畏的共产主义风格，表现出他的高瞻远瞩的科学预见。无数的历史事实证明，毛泽东同志是经过千锤百炼的伟大的马克思主义的理论家，是中国革命的伟大舵手，他在任何风浪中都能够正确地领导中国人民胜利前进。毛泽东思想，就是把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合的最完整的体现；毛泽东同志的著作，是在民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，创造性地发展了的马克思列宁主义，是我们进行一切工作的准则。凡是按照毛泽东同志的思想进行革命和建设，就一定会取得胜利；凡是违背了毛泽东同志思想的，就一定要失败。这是一个颠扑不破的真理。
    现在，我们的国家正在高速度地进行社会主义建设，大跃进形势的发展一日千里，许多同志都深深感到思想跟不上形势的发展。为了保证把我国迅速地建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，就必须认真地系统地学习毛泽东同志的著作，进一步提高我们的思想水平。
    毛泽东同志的著作很多，内容非常丰富，包括各个方面的理论和学说。概括起来，毛泽东同志的著作可以分为以下几类：关于马克思列宁主义的世界观和方法论；关于革命的基本理论和党的政治路线；关于无产阶级专政的学说；关于农民问题的学说；关于革命统一战线的学说；关于建立革命根据地的学说；关于社会主义经济建设问题的学说；关于战争和战略问题的学说；关于帝国主义的学说；关于国际共产主义运动的学说；关于文化艺术问题的学说；关于党的建设的学说。
    毛泽东同志的所有这些著作，都是我们必须系统学习、反复研究的。当前，首先要学习毛泽东同志关于世界观和方法论的学说，如“矛盾论”、“实践论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“改造我们的学习”、“关于领导方法的若干问题”、“农村调查的序言和跋”以及其他有关这些问题的著作和讲话等最重要的最根本的理论问题。同时，为了研究和掌握社会主义建设的规律，加速社会主义建设事业，必须学习毛泽东同志关于社会主义经济建设问题的学说。尤其是党的社会主义建设总路线，是毛泽东同志关于社会主义经济学说的集中表现；我们要从理论上深刻地理解总路线的内容，完整地领会总路线的精神。毛泽东同志关于无产阶级专政和阶级斗争的学说，关于国际形势和国际共产主义运动的历次分析，关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断，我们都必须很好地学习。
    要学好毛泽东同志的著作，还必须有正确的学习方法。第一，要系统地、反复地、深入地学习，真正领会毛泽东同志著作的精神和实质。有些著作每年要读几遍，有的每月要读几遍，有的要作为手册，作为座右铭，经常读，天天读，读熟读透。第二，要结合实践来学习。我们学习的目的，不是为学习而学习，是为了工作的需要而学习，为了解决实际问题而学习。因此，要一边学，一边做，边学边用，把理论和实际结合起来。第三，要开动脑筋，一边读，一边想，深思熟虑，刻苦钻研。不但要熟读，而且要加以消化。第四，不但要读、要想，而且要动手写文章。要根据毛泽东思想，不断地研究和总结工作，把实际工作的经验，提高到理论原则，作出科学的结论，写出既有实际材料，又有理论分析的文章。这样，就会更好地联系实际，就会学习得更加深入。第五，在学习毛泽东同志的著作的同时，结合学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作。例如，在学习毛泽东同志关于世界观、方法论的著作时，可以结合学习列宁的“唯物主义与经验批判主义”和“哲学笔记”等。概括起来，学习的方法，就是要读得精，想得通，做得到，写得出。
    毛泽东同志非常关心干部的理论学习，经常对我们循循善诱，殷切地希望各级领导同志成为真正的马克思主义者。我们决不能辜负毛泽东同志的希望，河南的同志们特别是各级党委的领导同志，一定要把学习毛泽东同志的著作当作自己的头等重要的任务。这样，我们不但可以学习得好，而且可以把工作做得更好，愉快胜任地完成党和人民交付的任务。
    当伟大的1960年来临的时候，我希望河南的同志们和全体干部在新的一年里，掀起一个学习毛泽东同志著作的高潮，从而不断地提高我们的马克思列宁主义理论水平。
