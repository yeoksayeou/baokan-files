    (Reported by this newspaper) In order to implement the "Southern Advance" expansion policy of the monopoly capitalist groups, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party announced on December 18, 1959, a Japanese foreign economic expansion plan mainly targeting Southeast Asian countries.
    According to this plan, the Kishi Nobusuke government will allocate 20 billion yen as funds for economic expansion; it is prepared to use the "Southeast Asia Development Cooperation Fund," which was not used in last year's budget, as part of this economic expansion fund. In addition, Japan will send more technical personnel abroad to actively conduct "technical guidance." In order to research and collect economic intelligence, Japan is preparing to dispatch "economic cooperation advisors" to Japanese embassies abroad, and a centralized organization for "economic cooperation advisors" will be established in the central government.

    自由民主党制订经济扩张方案
    “南进”扩张野心毕露
    本报讯　日本执政的自由民主党为了执行垄断资本集团的“南进”扩张政策，于1959年12月18日公布了主要以东南亚国家为对象的日本对外经济扩张方案。
    根据这项方案，岸信介政府将拨出二百亿日元作为经济扩张的资金；准备把上年度预算中没有动用的“东南亚开发合作资金”作为这笔经济扩张资金的一部分。此外，日本将向国外增派技术人员，积极进行“技术指导”。为了研究和收集经济情报，日本准备派遣“经济合作顾问”前往日本驻外使馆，而在中央则设立“经济合作顾问”集中的机构。
