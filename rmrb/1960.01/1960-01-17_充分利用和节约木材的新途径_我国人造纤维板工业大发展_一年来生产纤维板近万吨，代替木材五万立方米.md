    (Our Tianjin Dispatch, January 16th) China's man-made fiberboard industry achieved tremendous success in 1959. A total of more than 300 fiberboard factories and workshops were built and put into production throughout the year, producing nearly 10,000 tons of fiberboard for the entire year, saving the country more than 50,000 cubic meters of timber.

    Since the Ministry of Forestry proposed the policy of simultaneously increasing the production of logs and developing the man-made fiberboard industry in 1959, the fiberboard industry has sprung up like mushrooms after rain and developed rapidly throughout the country. At present, from forest areas such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Fujian, and Sichuan, to coastal and inland cities, factories and workshops producing fiberboard have been established one after another; many people's communes have also established or are establishing simple, indigenous manufacturing plants. The ceiling panels, partition panels, various furniture, cultural goods, and packaging materials manufactured by these man-made fiberboard factories are generally welcomed by users.

    The man-made fiberboard industry is one of China's emerging industries. Its emergence not only opens up new avenues for expanding timber supply and conserving logs, but also reduces the area of logging, extends the operating life of forest areas, and lays the foundation for forest areas to become perpetually operational. According to statistics, for every 10 million cubic meters of timber felled in forest areas, there are 3 million cubic meters of waste materials such as branches, bark, and board ends. If these waste materials are fully utilized, 1 million tons of fiberboard can be produced. Heilongjiang Province alone has 3 million cubic meters of waste material that can be utilized throughout the year. At the same time, cotton stalks, bitter bamboo, rice straw, reeds, etc., have found new outlets.

    The man-made fiberboard industry has achieved such rapid development in a short period of time mainly because various localities have implemented the "small-scale as the mainstay, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and indigenous first, foreign later" two-pronged approach. Jiangsu Province, starting in November of last year, established 37 factories for the indigenous production of fiberboard in Nanjing, Wuxi, and other places in less than forty-five days. Factories in many regions have continuously consolidated and improved, progressing from indigenous to foreign methods, and from small to large scale. When the Tianjin Timber Factory first started producing fiberboard, it used a hand-operated hot press for trial production, resulting in high costs and low quality. However, as the workers gradually improved the equipment and operations, within a year, the fourteen processes have been transformed from being mainly manual labor to continuous mechanized production from raw materials to finished products. The factory has used 5,000 cubic meters of split wood, shavings, and other scraps that were originally treated as fuel as raw materials, and now produces 1,200 tons of fiberboard annually, thereby solving the factory's timber shortage problem.

    Fully mobilizing the masses and carrying out a technical innovation movement are also the main reasons for the rapid development of the fiberboard industry. The Shanghai Timber Factory No. 1 has significantly improved labor efficiency in the technical innovation movement. Improving the hot press alone increased annual production capacity from 600 tons to approximately 1,000 tons. The Hangzhou Lumber Mill, which originally had to ask other factories to repair even minor hot press malfunctions, has now successively trial-produced complex equipment and accessories such as automatic feeders and hot press high-pressure oil pumps, which not only solved the factory's equipment shortage difficulties but also increased production efficiency fivefold.

    When summarizing and promoting the experience of 1959, the Ministry of Forestry decided to launch a high tide of fiberboard production in 1960, proposing that the timber industry should adhere to the spirit of comprehensive development and utilization in the future, continue to implement the policy of simultaneously increasing log production and vigorously developing man-made fiberboard, and combining timber harvesting and renewal, and universally establish fiberboard industries that take local materials and process them locally in forest areas, cities, and people's communes.

    充分利用和节约木材的新途径
    我国人造纤维板工业大发展
    一年来生产纤维板近万吨，代替木材五万立方米
    本报天津16日电　我国人造纤维板工业，在1959年取得了巨大的成绩。一年里建成并投入生产的纤维板工厂、车间共有三百多处，全年生产纤维板近一万吨，为国家节约了五万多立方米木材。
    从1959年林业部提出增产原木和发展人造纤维板工业同时并举的方针以后，纤维板工业就像雨后春笋一样，在全国各地迅速发展起来。目前，从黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古、福建、四川等林区到沿海、内地的城市都纷纷建立起生产纤维板的工厂、车间；不少人民公社也建立或正在建立简易的土法制造工厂。这些人造纤维板工厂制造的天棚板、隔墙板、各种家具和文化用品、包装材料等，普遍受到使用单位欢迎。
    人造纤维板工业是我国新兴的工业之一，它的出现，不但为扩大木材供应和节约原木开辟了新途径，而且减少了采伐面积，延长了林区的经营年限，为林区变成为永续作业打下了基础。据统计，在林区采伐一千万立方米木材，就有三百万立方米的枝丫、板皮、板头等废材，这些废材充分利用起来以后，就可以生产纤维板一百万吨，仅黑龙江省一地全年就有三百万立方米的废材可以利用。同时，也使棉秆、苦竹、稻草、芦苇等，有了新的出路。
    人造纤维板工业在短时间里获得这样快的发展，主要是各地贯彻了“小型为主，土洋结合，先土后洋”两条腿走路的方针。江苏省从去年11月开始，不到四十五天就在南京、无锡等地建立了三十七个土法生产纤维板的工厂。许多地区的工厂已由土到洋、由小到大，不断巩固提高。天津木材厂开始生产纤维板的时候，用一台手搬热压机试制，成本高，质量低；但是由于职工们逐步改进设备、改进操作，不到一年就在十四道工序中，从过去的以人力为主变为从原料到成品的连续不断的机械化生产。这个厂已用原来当做烧材处理的五千立方米劈材、刨花等下脚料做原料，年产纤维板一千二百吨，从而解决了这个厂木材不足的问题。
    充分发动群众和开展技术革新运动，也是纤维板工业得以飞跃发展的主要原因。上海木材一厂在技术革新运动中，使劳动效率有了显著提高，仅改进热压机一项就使年产六百吨的能力提高到年产一千吨左右。原来连热压机发生故障都要请外厂来修理的杭州制材厂，现在，职工们已陆续试制成功自动进料器、热压机高压油泵等复杂的设备和配件，既解决了厂子设备不足的困难，又使生产效率提高了五倍。
    林业部在总结推广1959年经验的时候，决定在1960年要掀起一个大搞纤维板的生产高潮，提出今后木材工业要本着全面开发、全面利用的精神，继续贯彻执行增产原木和大搞人造纤维板同时并举、木材采伐和更新并举的方针，在林区、城市和人民公社普遍地建立起就地取材、就地加工的纤维板工业。
