Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 15th: Sets of 10,000-volt high-voltage bridges are being produced in a Shanghai alley factory - the Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory - and supplied to all parts of the country. Who would have thought that this industrial product of instruments and meters, which used to rely on imports, was successfully trial-produced by Wang Linhe, a young worker with only a junior high school education?

Wang Linhe is twenty-nine years old this year. Under the education and support of the Party, and with the help of the workers, he spent more than a year conducting 371 experiments and finally produced this advanced and precise product.

The high-voltage bridge, known as the "eye" for testing the performance of high-voltage circuit insulation materials, is an indispensable piece of equipment for power stations, electrical appliance factories, petroleum factories, chemical factories, and other factories. In the past, it could not be manufactured domestically. In 1958, with the rapid development of national economic construction, various places urgently requested Shanghai to supply it. Some purchasing agents came from thousands of miles away to order this product from the Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory. However, this factory could only produce ordinary 6-volt bridges for laboratory use. The workers were very anxious when they saw the urgent need in all aspects. Wang Linhe thought: "What others have, we must have; what others don't have, we will create. Only in this way can we change the poor and blank face of the motherland and quickly catch up with the world's advanced industrial level." Wang Linhe left home at the age of sixteen to work as an apprentice in a factory and suffered all kinds of hardships in the old society. Now he has a better life and has reached a junior high school education at the workers' spare-time school. Driven by this strong desire, regardless of the fact that he had not even seen the shadow of a high-voltage bridge, and regardless of the fact that his factory was a small alley factory with simple equipment, he was determined to manufacture an advanced bridge. His wish and determination were supported by the factory's Party branch.

From then on, the Shanghai Library, the Science and Technology Library, the Xinhua Bookstore, and the Foreign Language Bookstore could all find traces of this young worker. From a large pile of books, Wang Linhe found three pages of introduction to the use, performance, and basic circuits of high-voltage bridges. With these three pages of information, he pondered hard, and when he encountered problems he couldn't understand, he studied them with the workers in the workshop. After more than ten days, Wang Linhe finally drew a rough sketch of the instrument.

The Party branch immediately supported him in trial production. If parts had to be manufactured, the turners would help him process them; if materials were needed, the workers would go out to help him find them. The high-voltage bridge has more than 2,000 parts, and countless difficulties were overcome in the trial production process. Especially in the manufacturing of the high-voltage air capacitor support, Wang Linhe was almost defeated.

According to the information, the high-voltage air capacitor support should be made of a material called "ultra-high frequency magnetic." This is an advanced insulation material. With it, when high-voltage current passes through the high-voltage air capacitor, the power loss rate does not exceed five parts per 100,000, which meets the design standards. However, this material is difficult to buy. What should be done? Wang Linhe decided to find substitutes. The Party branch supported his opinion and sent seven workers to help him experiment. He found glass, bakelite, quartz, and other materials with good insulation performance for testing. Once, ten times, fifty times, the record of failed experiments continued to increase.

The 90th failed experiment was recorded. Wang Linhe slumped down in front of the test bench in a daze. At this time, he thought of Wu Yunduo's story of setting up an arsenal with a pair of pliers and a long bench; he thought of the enthusiastic help of his comrades in this trial production; he thought of what the Party branch secretary had once told him: "How can there be creation without difficulties! How can there be success without failure!" Thinking, thinking, a surge of heat flowed through his body, and he felt full of energy. He excitedly assured the Party branch secretary who came to see him: "Never bow to difficulties!"

The experiment continued. The failure record rose to 100 times, 200 times. At this time, Wang Linhe suddenly fell ill, his temperature was close to 40 degrees Celsius, and he was sent to the hospital.

After coming out of the hospital, Wang Linhe continued the experiment non-stop. At this time, he heard that the pottery clay in Yixing had very good insulation performance. He was very happy and took the train that day. When he arrived in Yixing, it was already dark, and it was dozens of miles from the station to the kiln. It was windy and rainy outside, and it was pitch black. Regardless of these things, Wang Linhe got off the car and went straight to the kiln. In the kiln, he found the pottery clay he needed.

Back in Shanghai, he didn't even eat and immediately went to the factory to conduct experiments. However, in the 340th experiment, the power loss rate could only reach ten parts per 100,000, which still did not meet the specifications. Thanks to the education of the Party, he was determined: even if he tried it a thousand more times, he would overcome this hurdle.

Finally, with the help of the workers, he sought advice from teachers and friends and found a new material. The experiment was carried out for the 371st time, proving that the power loss rate was only three parts per 100,000, and the insulation performance was even better than required.

Having overcome this biggest hurdle, the 10,000-volt high-voltage bridge was finally successfully trial-produced in October last year.

After the new product was put into mass production, Wang Linhe started new efforts. In December last year, he and his companions made a 50,000-volt high-voltage bridge together.

Now, Wang Linhe has honorably joined the Communist Party of China and is also an advanced producer in the city.

    坚决听党的话  依靠集体力量  试验三百多次  征服各种困难
    王林鹤心红劲足制成高压电桥
    初中程度的青年工人攻下技术尖端
    设备简陋的弄堂小厂造出高级产品
    新华社上海15日电　一套套一万伏高压电桥，正从上海一家弄堂工厂——沪光科学仪器厂里生产出来，供应全国各地。有谁知道，这种过去依靠进口的仪器仪表工业产品，是一个只有初中文化程度的青年工人王林鹤试制成功的呢。
    王林鹤，今年二十九岁。他在党的教育和支持下，职工们的帮助下，花了一年多的时间，作了三百七十一次试验，终于制成了这种高级、精密的产品。
    被称为检验高压电路绝缘材料性能的“眼睛”——高压电桥，是电站、电器厂、石油厂、化工厂等厂不可缺少的设备。过去，国内还不能制造。1958年，随着国家经济建设的迅速发展，各地迫切要求上海供应。有些采购员迢迢千里而来，向沪光科学仪器厂订购这种产品。可是，这个厂只能生产实验室用的六伏的普通电桥。职工们看到各方面这样迫切需要，心里很着急。王林鹤想：“人家有的，我们要有；人家没有的，我们来创造。这样才能改变祖国一穷二白的面貌，迅速赶上世界先进的工业水平。”王林鹤十六岁离家，到一家工厂当学徒，在旧社会受尽了苦。现在他生活好了，而且在职工业余学校读到了初中文化程度。他在这种强烈愿望的推动下，不顾自己连高压电桥的影子还没有看见过，也不顾自己的工厂是个设备简陋的弄堂小厂，下决心一定要制造出高级电桥来。他的愿望和决心得到了工厂党支部的支持。
    从此以后，上海图书馆、科技图书馆、新华书店、外文书店，都可以找到这个青年工人的踪迹。王林鹤从厚厚一大堆的书籍里，找到了三页有关高压电桥使用、性能和基本线路的介绍。凭着这三页资料，他就苦思苦想，碰到想不通的地方，就同车间里的工人一起研究。经过十多天，王林鹤终于画出了这套仪器的草图。
    党支部立刻支持他进行试制。要制造零件，车工们帮助他加工；要材料，工人们出去帮他寻找。高压电桥有两千多个零部件，在试制过程中不知克服了多少困难。特别是在制造高压空气电容器支架这个零件的时候，几乎把王林鹤难倒。
    按照资料规定，高压空气电容器支架要用一种名叫“超高频磁”的材料制成。这是一种高级绝缘材料，有了它，高压电流通过高压空气电容器的时候，损电率不超过十万分之五，才达到设计的标准。可是，这种材料很难买到。怎么办呢？王林鹤决定寻找代用品。党支部支持他的意见，并且派了七个工人帮助他试验。他找了玻璃、胶木、石英等绝缘性能较好的材料作试验，一次、十次、五十次，试验失败的纪录不断地增加。
    记下了第九十次试验失败的纪录。王林鹤颓然坐在试验台前发呆。这时候，他想到了吴运铎用一把老虎钳、一只长凳办兵工厂的故事；想到了这次试制中同志们的热情帮助；想到了党支部书记曾经跟他说的话：“没有困难，怎会有创造！没有失败，怎会有成功！”想着、想着，一股热流在他身上流动着，感到浑身是劲。他激动地向来看望他的党支部书记保证：“决不向困难低头！”
    试验工作继续进行下去。失败纪录升到一百次、两百次。这时候，王林鹤突然病倒了，体温近摄氏四十度，被送进了医院。
    从医院里出来，王林鹤又一刻不停地继续试验。这时候，他听说宜兴的陶土绝缘性能很好，真是高兴极了，当天就搭上火车。到了宜兴，天已经黑了，从车站到窑厂要走几十里路。外面刮着大风，下着大雨，伸手不见五指。王林鹤不顾这些，下了车，就直奔窑厂。在窑厂，他找到了所需用的陶土。
    回到上海，他饭也不吃，又立刻到厂里进行试验。但是，试验到第三百四十次，损电率只能达到十万分之十，仍旧不合规格要求。由于党的教育，他下定决心：就是再试一千次，也要攻下这一关。
    最后，他在职工们的帮助下，寻师访友，找到了一种新的材料。试验进行到第三百七十一次，证明损电率只有十万分之三，绝缘性能比要求的还要好。
    越过了这个最大的难关，一万伏高压电桥终于在去年10月试制成功了。
    新产品成批投入生产以后，王林鹤又开始了新的努力。去年12月，他和同伴们又一起制成了五万伏高压电桥。
    现在，王林鹤已经光荣地参加了中国共产党，同时是市的先进生产者。（附图片）
