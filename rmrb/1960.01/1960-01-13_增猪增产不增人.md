Combining the roles of pig feeder, disease prevention worker, and breeding worker is an important measure to improve the level of feeding management, and also an important measure to develop the pig-raising industry in a faster, better, and more economical way.

Improving the level of feeding management is of decisive significance to accelerating the development of the pig-raising industry. Wherever the level of feeding management is high, the pig-raising industry develops quickly and well. Conversely, poor management is often an important reason for pig deaths and farm losses.

The main indicators for measuring whether the feeding management work of a pig farm or a feeder is good are whether the sow's farrowing rate is high, whether the fattening pigs grow fast, whether the boars are in good condition, and whether the survival rate of piglets is high. To achieve these requirements, it is not enough for the feeder to only know how to feed; they must also understand various aspects of pig growth, development, diseases, and reproduction. For example, to increase the sow's farrowing rate, the feeder must understand the estrus characteristics and breeding knowledge of sows in order to breed in time and ensure that the sows are fully pregnant and highly productive. Furthermore, diseases such as swine fever, swine erysipelas, swine pneumonia, and piglet white diarrhea are the most serious diseases that endanger the rapid development of the pig-raising industry. To prevent the occurrence of diseases and eradicate them, the feeder needs to understand certain scientific knowledge of disease prevention and treatment. "Combining the three roles" is an effective measure to cultivate feeders to understand disease prevention and breeding knowledge and improve feeding levels.

In Taixing County, only the Liuqiao Brigade of Changzhou Commune raised the issue of "combining the three roles" at the end of 1958. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of the county party committee and party committees at all levels, and the serious promotion of this advanced experience, in just over a year, a new situation has emerged in the pig-raising industry: last year, swine fever, swine erysipelas, swine pneumonia, and piglet white diarrhea did not occur, ensuring the healthy development of new pig herds; the feeding volume of sows has doubled compared to 1958, and for the first time, the county achieved full sow pregnancy.

"Combining the three roles" is a new thing. Like the development process of all new things, some people will always have doubts and concerns. When Taixing County promoted "combining the three roles," some people said: "Combining the three roles is good, but the requirements are too high and cannot be achieved." Of course, "combining the three roles" raises the requirements for feeders, but disease prevention knowledge and breeding techniques are not complex and unattainable knowledge. With a little training and learning, they can be mastered by the majority of feeders. Is not the fact that one-third of the more than 20,000 feeders in Taixing County have met the requirements of "combining the three roles" in one year a vivid example? Some people also say: "After combining the three roles, it will increase the feeder's working hours and workload, which will affect work efficiency." This statement is also untenable. Taking disease prevention work as an example, if there is knowledge of disease prevention and treatment, so that pigs do not get sick, get sick less, and know how to cure them faster when they get sick, this will not increase the workload, but will greatly reduce it; it will not reduce the number of pigs raised, but will greatly increase it. Haven't many facts in Taixing County already proved this?

At present, various production undertakings in rural areas are developing on a large scale, and in the case of labor being needed in all aspects, Taixing County's practice of "combining the three roles" is a good experience of increasing pigs and production without increasing people.

    饲养员、防疫员、配种员三员合一，是提高饲养管理水平的一个重要措施，也是多快好省发展养猪事业的一个重要措施。
    提高饲养管理水平对加快养猪事业发展有决定性的意义。什么地方的饲养管理水平高，养猪事业就发展得快，发展得好。反之，管理不善，常常是造成猪只死亡、猪场赔本的一个重要原因。
    衡量一个养猪场、一个饲养员饲养管理工作是否好，主要的标志是看母猪产仔率高不高，肥猪长得快不快，公猪膘好不好，仔猪成活率高不高。要达到这些要求，饲养员仅仅懂得如何喂养是不够的，还必须懂得有关猪的生长、发育、疾病、繁殖等各方面的知识。比如，要使母猪产仔率高，饲养员就必须懂得母猪发情特征和配种知识，才能及时配种，使母猪全孕、高产；再如，猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫和小猪白痢病等病疫，是危害养猪业迅速发展的最严重的病疫，要作到防止疾病发生和扑灭疾病，饲养员就需要懂得一定的防疫、治疗的科学知识。“三员合一”，正是为了培养饲养员懂得防疫、配种的知识，提高饲养水平的有效措施。
    泰兴县在1958年底只有常周公社刘桥大队提出了“三员合一”的问题，由于县委和各级党委的热情支持，认真推广了这个先进经验，到现在仅仅一年多一点的时间，在养猪事业上就出现了全新的局面：去年猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫和小猪白痢病都没有发生，保证了新的猪群健康地发展起来；母猪的饲养量比1958年增加了两倍，而且第一次实现了母猪满怀县。
    “三员合一”是一个新事物，像一切新生事物的发展过程一样，总会有一些人抱有这样那样的怀疑和顾虑，泰兴县各地在推行“三员合一”的时候，就有人说：“三员合一好是好，但要求太高了，做不到。”“三员合一”当然是对饲养员的要求提高了一些，但防疫知识和配种技术并不是什么复杂得高不可攀的学问，只要稍加训练学习，就能为广大饲养员所掌握。泰兴县二万多饲养员，在一年时间里，已有三分之一达到了“三员合一”的要求，不就是一个鲜明的例证吗？还有人说：“三员合一以后，会增加饲养员的劳动时间和工作量，反而会影响工作效率。”这种说法也是站不住脚的。以防疫工作为例，如果有了防疫和治疗的知识，使猪不生病，少生病，生了病也知道怎样更快治好，这不是增加了工作，反而会大大减少工作；不会降低饲养头数，反会大大提高饲养头数。泰兴县的许多事实不是已经证明了吗？
    目前，农村各项生产事业都在大规模发展，在各方面都需要劳动力的情况下，泰兴县的“三员合一”的作法，是增猪增产不增人的一条好经验。
