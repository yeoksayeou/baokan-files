Tumochuan is the Best in the World
Wang Shouqing

	A night of spring rain sprinkled down,
	And the fields fell in colorful sunset clouds.
	Tumochuan weaves brocade and spits out embroidery,
	Flowers bloom everywhere on the mountains and plains...
	The morning sun opens the cowshed,
	Red flags fly and roll over the green gauze;
	A bamboo pole breaks through a pond of spring water,
	Watching the morning breeze play with the flock of ducks...

	The iron hammer rings the grand bell,
	Thousands of trees blossom with loudspeakers;
	The big and small roads are noisy,
	Gathering the commune's people and horses!
	Plowing, harrowing,
	Seeds in one hand, sweat in the other;
	Sweat plus the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture,"
	Deeply rooting! …

	The first spring of the commune,
	The earth is gardenized;
	Everyone says Jiangnan is good,
	But do they know the beautiful pictures beyond the Great Wall?
	— Crossing the Yellow River in spring,
	And the Yangtze River in autumn harvest;
	Winter goes and spring comes again for another year,
	Tumochuan, is the best in the world...

    土默川  甲天下
    王绶青一夜春雨洒，田野落彩霞。土默川织锦吐绣，漫山遍野大兴花……朝阳打开牛栏，红旗飞卷青纱；竹篙点破一塘春水，看晓风嬉戏群鸭……铁锤敲响洪钟，千树万树放喇叭；大路小路声喧哗，汇来公社的人马！犁的犁，耙的耙，种子一把汗一把；汗水加上“八字法”，深深把根扎！……公社第一春，大地田园化；人人都说江南好，可知塞外美图画？—春天过黄河，秋收把长江跨；冬去春来又一载，土默川，甲天下……
