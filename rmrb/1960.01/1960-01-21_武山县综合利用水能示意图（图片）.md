Editor's Note: The people of Wushan County, Gansu, combine water conservancy construction and utilize water energy in a comprehensive manner, adapting to local conditions. The county uses water energy as power to drive more than twenty kinds of tools to process agricultural and sideline products, saving a lot of manpower and animal power. The following tools have been promoted throughout the county: wooden double-impact water turbine, hydraulic double-disc automatic mill, hydraulic cotton gin, hydraulic oil press, hydraulic vegetable cutter, hydraulic corn thresher, hydraulic rice thresher, hydraulic flax processing machine, hydraulic ore crusher, hydraulic sawmill, hydraulic high-line transport, hydraulic yarn reversing machine, hydraulic spinning machine, hydraulic twisting machine, hydraulic weft yarn machine, hydraulic weaving machine, hydraulic sock knitting machine, hydraulic rice milling machine, wooden propeller water turbine, hydraulic blower, etc. Here are schematic diagrams of several tools that are more widely used.

Hydraulic Corn Thresher
	Wenjiasi Production Team, Guohuai Management Area, Luomen People's Commune, uses a water mill to drive a corn thresher, increasing work efficiency twenty times compared to the original manual corn threshing.

Hydraulic Rice Milling Machine
	Wenjiasi Production Team, Guohuai Management Area, Luomen People's Commune, installs a grinding table and grinding roller on the water mill to use hydraulic power to mill rice, greatly improving work efficiency.

Simple Hydropower Station
	Wenjiasi Production Team, Guohuai Management Area, Luomen People's Commune, uses simple equipment to convert an old water mill into a simple small hydropower station, and modified it into an induction motor to replace the generator for power generation, meeting the electricity needs of industrial and agricultural production and lighting. The total cost of this small hydropower station, excluding the motor and electrical equipment, is only 150 yuan.

Hydraulic Oil Press
	Wenjiasi Production Team, Guohuai Management Area, Luomen People's Commune, uses the water from the water mill to drive the oil press to process oilseeds, increasing work efficiency five times compared to general manual oil pressing.

Hydraulic Ore Crusher
	The Yuanyang Cement Plant of Xinsi People's Commune successfully created a hydraulic ore crusher by using the drop in water flow, which increases work efficiency forty times compared to the original manual crushing of ore and saves a large amount of labor.

Hydraulic Sawmill
	Staff of the Tange Forest Management Office of Chengguan People's Commune successfully created a hydraulic saw by using the drop in water flow, which increases work efficiency more than ten times compared to the original manual hand sawing.

Hydraulic Blower
	The Luomen Machinery Factory of Luomen People's Commune successfully created a hydraulic blower by using the drop in water flow for iron smelting, increasing work efficiency five times compared to the original manual hand-cranked blower.

    武山县综合利用水能示意图
    编者注：甘肃武山县人民，结合兴修水利，因地制宜，大搞水能综合利用。全县利用水能作动力，带动二十来种工具加工农副产品，节约了大量人力、畜力。已在全县推广的有下列一些工具：木制两击式水轮机、水力双盘自动磨、水力弹花机、水力榨油机、水力切菜机、水力玉米脱粒机、水力打稻机、水力亚麻加工机、水力碎矿机、水力锯木机、水力高线运输、水力倒纱机、水力纺纱机、水力合纱机、水力纬纱机、水力织布机、水力织袜机、水力碾米机、木制旋桨式水轮机、水力鼓风机等。这里发表的是使用范围较广的几种工具示意图。
    水力玉米脱粒机
    洛门人民公社郭槐管理区文家寺生产队，利用水磨带动玉米脱粒机，比原来人工的玉米脱粒提高工效二十倍。
    水力碾米机
    洛门人民公社郭槐管理区文家寺生产队，在水磨上安装碾台和碾滚，利用水力碾米，大大提高了工效。
    简易水力发电站
    洛门人民公社郭槐管理区文家寺生产队，利用简单设备在旧水磨上改建成简易小型水电站，并改制成感应电动机，代替发电机发电，满足工农业生产用电和照明需要。这种小型水力发电站，除电机和电气设备外，总造价才只有一百五十元。
    水力榨油机
    洛门人民公社郭槐管理区文家寺生产队，利用水磨的水，带动榨油机，进行油籽加工，比一般人工榨油提高工效五倍。
    水力碎矿机
    新寺人民公社鸳鸯水泥厂，利用流水落差，创制成功水力碎矿机，比原来人工碎矿石提高工效四十倍，并节省了大批劳力。
    水力锯木机
    城关人民公社滩歌森林管理所职工，利用流水落差，创制成功水力锯，比原来人工手拉锯板，提高工效十倍以上。
    水力鼓风机
    洛门人民公社洛门机械厂，利用流水落差，创制成功水力鼓风机，进行化铁。比原来人工手摇鼓风机 提高工效五倍。
