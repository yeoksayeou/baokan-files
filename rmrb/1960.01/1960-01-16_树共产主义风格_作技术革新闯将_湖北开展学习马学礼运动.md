    Promote Communist Style, Become a Vanguard of Technological Innovation
    Hubei Launches Movement to Learn from Ma Xueli
    (Our report) The broad masses of workers in Hubei Province are launching a movement to learn from Ma Xueli, to learn his communist attitude towards labor, his pioneering spirit in daring to innovate, and his excellent work style of maintaining close ties with the masses. Advanced workers across the province are making greater efforts to become even more advanced, while those lagging behind are striving to catch up, undergoing rapid transformations, and achieving numerous feats in production leaps and technological innovation.
    Ma Xueli, a fitter and Communist Party member at the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, is an advanced figure who emerged from the mass movement. He has been repeatedly recognized as a model worker and advanced producer and attended the National Congress of Heroes last year. Under the leadership of the Party, Ma Xueli has consistently worked diligently, laboring without regard for remuneration and working without preconditions. He has united closely with the masses, overcome many difficulties, and engaged in large-scale technological innovation. Whether inside or outside the plant, he makes innovative suggestions at any time and any place. His innovative achievements can be found on lathes, milling machines, planers, rotary machines, boring machines, as well as tools, fixtures, and molds, increasing labor productivity by multiples, sometimes dozens of times. However, Ma Xueli never attributes these achievements to himself. When people asked him, "How many innovative suggestions have you made?" he said, "I really can't answer because I never thought of any of them as my own." Ma Xueli also often humbly learns from others' advanced experiences, treats others' difficulties as his own, and enthusiastically and proactively helps lagging workers and groups catch up with the advanced.
    In October of last year, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on everyone at the Provincial Congress of Heroes to learn Ma Xueli's attitude of "laboring for the lofty ideal of realizing communism," his pioneering spirit in daring to innovate, and his excellent work style of maintaining close ties with the masses. This call immediately received a warm response from representatives of all advanced production (work) personnel, who issued a proposal to all workers in the province to launch a movement to learn from Ma Xueli. Subsequently, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China officially issued a decision on launching a movement to learn from Ma Xueli. The decision also required all enterprises, on the basis of carrying out this movement and in conjunction with promoting the Daye Steel Plant's experience of mobilizing the masses to organize "key problem tackling battles," to promptly guide thousands upon thousands of Ma Xueli-style individuals and Ma Xueli-style groups to the main direction and main front of technological innovation, in order to concentrate superior forces to fight annihilating battles, overcome weak links, and promote production development.
    According to the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's decision, all fronts across the province are treating this movement first as an ideological movement, taking the learning of Ma Xueli as a positive teaching material and important content of socialist education and the general line education. After the ideological awareness and political enthusiasm of the workers have been generally improved, the masses are promptly mobilized to formulate innovation plans around the key production issues. All localities and units have held oath-taking meetings or broadcast meetings to learn from Ma Xueli and catch up with Ma Xueli, using various forms to vigorously publicize Ma Xueli's advanced thinking and advanced deeds. In this way, the industrial, mining, transportation enterprises, and financial and trade systems quickly launched a high tide of learning from Ma Xueli.
    Many workers have taken Ma Xueli as a mirror, comparing themselves to examine their own thinking. For example, Zhou Yuanzhen, a cloth-stopping worker at the Shashi City Dazhong Textile Factory, was originally able to watch two looms, but she found it tiring and was unwilling to do so. In particular, when the piece-rate wage was changed to a time-rate wage, her enthusiasm was even lower. When she compared herself to Ma Xueli's thinking, she felt very ashamed. She said, "Ma Xueli does not consider conditions or remuneration, and wholeheartedly contributes all his strength to the Party and socialist construction, while I am preoccupied with personal gains and losses, and I am unwilling to do things that I am capable of doing. Compared with Ma Xueli, it is really too shameful!" She took the initiative to resume watching two looms and completed the annual production plan sixty-three days ahead of schedule. She also actively helped the new workers in her team improve their skills. Now all the new workers in the team can watch one and a half looms, and the daily output of bed sheets has jumped from more than sixty to ninety-three.
    The in-depth development of the movement to learn from Ma Xueli has promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act among the workers and masses, and further promoted the technological innovation and technological revolution movement across the province. After the workers of the Jiang'an Vehicle Plant launched the movement to learn from Ma Xueli, they put forward more than 20,000 innovative suggestions within ten days, which is equivalent to thirty-eight times all the suggestions from January to October of last year.
    The movement to learn from Ma Xueli has also promoted mass socialist great competition. In the movement to learn from Ma Xueli, many units have also established pacesetters in their own systems and units, allowing workers to learn from them in combination, such as the textile departments in Wuhan City proposing "learning from Ma Xueli, catching up with Zhu Zaodi," and the transportation departments proposing "learning from Ma Xueli, catching up with Wu Deyi," and so on. There are various forms of competition, such as head-to-head competitions, pairing competitions, technical performance competitions, and three-shift relay races. A thriving new atmosphere of pacesetters becoming forests and competitions forming networks has emerged in various places. This has powerfully guaranteed that many enterprises, groups, and workers have completed the annual production plan for 1959 ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, achieving a good start this year.

    树共产主义风格　作技术革新闯将
    湖北开展学习马学礼运动
    本报讯　湖北省广大职工正在开展学习马学礼运动，学习他的共产主义劳动态度，学习他勇于革新的首创精神，学习他密切联系群众的优良作风。全省职工先进的鼓足干劲，力争更加先进，落后的奋发向上，纷纷转变，生产跃进和革新技术的事迹大量涌现。
    武汉重型机床厂调整工、共产党员马学礼是群众运动中成长起来的先进人物，多次被评为劳动模范和先进生产者，去年曾出席了全国群英大会。马学礼在党的领导下，一贯勤勤恳恳地工作，劳动不计报酬，工作不讲条件，同群众紧密团结在一起，克服许多困难，大搞技术革新，无论在厂内、厂外，随时随地提革新建议，车、铣、刨、旋、搪等机床和工、卡、模具上，几乎都有他的革新事迹，成倍、成几十倍地提高了劳动生产率。但是，马学礼从来不把这些成绩归功于个人。人们问他：“你究竟提过多少条革新建议？”他说：“我实在答不出来，因为我没有想到哪是我一个人的东西。”马学礼还经常虚心学习别人的先进经验，把别人的困难看成自己的困难，热情、主动地帮助后进的工人和小组赶上先进。
    去年10月份，中共湖北省委在全省群英大会上号召大家学习马学礼“为实现共产主义的崇高理想而劳动”的劳动态度、勇于革新的首创精神和密切联系群众的优良作风。这一号召立即得到全体先进生产（工作）者代表的热烈响应，他们向全省职工发出了开展学习马学礼运动的倡议书。接着，中共湖北省委又正式发出了关于开展学习马学礼运动的决定。决定还要求各企业在开展这一运动的基础上，结合推广大冶钢厂发动群众组织“攻关战役”的经验，把千千万万个马学礼式的人和马学礼式的小组及时地引导到技术革新的主攻方向和主攻阵地上，以便集中优势兵力打歼灭战，克服薄弱环节，促进生产发展。
    全省各条战线根据省委决定的精神，把这一运动首先作为一个思想运动来抓，把学习马学礼作为社会主义教育和总路线教育的正面教材和重要内容。在职工思想觉悟、政治热情普遍提高以后，又及时发动群众围绕生产关键，制定革新规划。各地、各单位都召开了学马学礼、赶马学礼的誓师大会或广播大会，运用各种形式对马学礼的先进思想、先进事迹进行了大张旗鼓的宣传。这样，各工矿交通企业和财贸系统很快地就掀起了学习马学礼的热潮。
    许多职工把马学礼当做一面镜子，对照着检查了自己的思想。例如，沙市市大中织物厂大布挡车工周元珍本来能看两台布机，但嫌吃力，不愿意看；特别是计件工资改为计时工资时，劲头就更不足了。她对照马学礼的思想检查自己时感到很惭愧，她说：“马学礼不计较条件、不计较报酬，忠心耿耿为党、为社会主义建设贡献出自己的一切力量，而我却斤斤计较个人得失，本来能做到的事也不愿意做，同马学礼比较起来，实在太可耻了！”她主动提出恢复看两台布机，提前六十三天完成了全年生产计划。她还积极帮助本班的新工人提高技术，现在全班新工人都能看一台半布机，被单日产量由六十多条跃为九十三条。
    学习马学礼运动深入开展，促进了职工群众敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，进一步推动了全省技术革新和技术革命运动。江岸车辆厂职工开展学习马学礼运动以后，十天之内就提出革新建议两万多条，相当于去年1至10月份全部建议的三十八倍。
    学习马学礼运动还促进了群众性的社会主义大竞赛。很多单位在学马学礼运动中，还树立了本系统、本单位的标兵，让职工们结合起来学习，如武汉市纺织部门提出“学习马学礼、赶上朱早弟”，交通运输部门提出“学习马学礼，赶上吴德义”等等。对手赛、挂钩赛、技术表演赛、三班接力赛等，形式多种多样。各地出现了标兵成林、竞赛成网的欣欣向荣的新气象。这便有力地保证了许多企业、小组、工人提前超额完成了1959年的全年生产计划，实现了今年开门红。（附图片）
