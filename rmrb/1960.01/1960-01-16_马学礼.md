    Ma Xueli
    Writing Group of the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    One day, at the technical innovation exhibition of the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory, a newly created sample tool was on display. Next to it was a large-character poster that read: "Liu Qun has a high level of awareness and good innovation methods. He processed crane hooks and created a sample tool. Machines replace manpower, greatly improving efficiency." Everyone was looking at it with great interest when Liu Qun blushed and kept saying, "Wrong! The praise is wrong!"
    Liu Qun went straight to Ma Xueli. "Master Ma, it's your creation, why is it being said that it's mine? Someone wrote it wrong!"
    "It's not wrong, I provided the material for the large-character poster," Ma Xueli said. "The matter was originally done by you. As long as the key to production is solved, what difference does it make to praise you or praise me?" Before Ma Xueli could finish explaining, worker Peng Maotang also came. He told everyone: "The internal hole boring tool was also made by Foreman Ma, but the large-character poster praised me."...
    These new events quickly reached the Party General Branch. So the General Branch Secretary went to Ma Xueli to ask him what was going on. Who knew Ma Xueli's answer was both simple and clear: "I am a Communist Party member and a foreman. It is my duty to help workers solve technical problems in production. As long as it can inspire everyone's enthusiasm, it doesn't matter if people don't know it was me, does it?"
    Later, the Party branch went to the masses to investigate and learned that Ma Xueli had experienced such things more than ten times, but he had never mentioned himself once.
    This is a noble character. To understand this quality, one must start with his history.
  Fighting for Socialism—Communism
    In the autumn of 1931, a serious locust plague occurred in Ma Xueli's hometown of Shandong Province. With no food or clothing, his father dragged the family of five and "broke through" to the Northeast, arriving in Shenyang. At the age of eleven, Ma Xueli entered a metal factory run by the Japanese as a young apprentice, shedding tears and wiping his nose, he barely made it until the Japanese surrendered. When the Kuomintang came, Ma Xueli's family still lived in hell. When the family was too hungry, his father picked up the tattered clothes and bedding at home and went to the countryside to exchange them for soybean cakes, but they were robbed by bandits, and his father was beaten and vomited blood;...
    Liberation came, and the sky brightened. Ma Xueli was admitted to the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory as a lathe operator in 1950, and promoted to technician in 1951. Workers no longer had to suffer beatings and bullying, and truly became the masters of the factory.
    In order to cultivate him, the Party often gave him opportunities to train and improve his skills. With the specific help of the workshop director, his skills improved rapidly. In October 1954, he gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. In 1956, the Party sent him to the Soviet Union to study.
    Ma Xueli's class consciousness rapidly improved. He understood how he should treat labor and how he should treat our lofty ideal—Communism. Fighting for Socialism-Communism. This is Ma Xueli's great ambition. He demanded himself according to the standards of a communist fighter. So he said to the comrades who wanted to give him credit: "No! Comrades, the account should be recorded like this: this is the merit of the Party, the merit of everyone."
    Giving Credit to Others, Taking Difficulties for Oneself
    Ma Xueli put the credit on others, but when encountering difficulties, he did not give in at all. As long as he was given any difficult task, he never bargained.
    In May of last year, a major bottleneck appeared in the workshop—the processing progress of the slide was seriously behind. The slide was about two meters long and needed to be drilled with an inner hole with a diameter of 133 mm; the original processing method was to first drill a hole with a drill bit, and then use a lathe tool to expand it three times. Although the twist drill was changed to a deep-hole drill, and some improvements were made to the processing method, the drill bit was still easy to break, and the progress was still not up to par. As a result, more than half of the materials put in in March were still left by May. Even more distressing was that a lot of useful steel became discarded iron filings.
    One day, Qin Guanghan, who was processing the slide, came to Ma Xueli: "Give me another person, my apprentice and I are doing one shift, it's really tiring!" Ma Xueli remembered the trepanning tool he had seen in the Soviet Union. This kind of work was both labor-saving and efficient, and could trepan out a whole piece of steel. When he returned to China from the Soviet Union, he also brought back a set of drawings and handed them over to the factory's central data room.
    Ma Xueli was not the only one who mentioned the trepanning tool. However, it had been delayed for eight months without a solution. Ma Xueli had also approached the relevant departments more than once, but the comrades in the tool section said: "The design of the trepanning tool is too complex, and the requirements are too precise, and it is difficult to manufacture. Let's just drill it!" At this time, Ma Xueli couldn't bear it any longer. He thought to himself: "The Soviet Union can manufacture it, and we have the Soviet Union's data, can't we manufacture it?" He wrote a large-character poster:
      "The trepanning tool has been delayed for more than half a year, good materials turn into iron scraps. Technology section, tool section, will you make it or not? If you are afraid of difficulties, bring the materials and we will make it!"
    A few days passed, and the large-character poster was like a stone sinking into the sea, with no response. Ma Xueli thought: "You don't believe it, okay! We'll make it for you to see." The suggestion to trial-produce the trepanning tool was immediately supported by the Party organization. The General Branch Secretary urged Ma Xueli to start as soon as they met, and also asked if there were any difficulties.
    The trial production of the trepanning tool began. After several efforts, the first trepanning tool was put on the lathe. The experiment began, and Ma Xueli personally operated the machine, with dozens of eyes nervously watching him. After a while, Ma Xueli stopped the machine, and the trepanning tool could not trepan out the material. Some people said sarcastically: "Other factories have tried many times without success, why bother to make such a big effort?"
    Ma Xueli stood next to the machine tool, not moving an inch, his eyes with furrowed eyebrows intently staring at the trepanning tool. None of the workers left, all quietly thinking hard. Suddenly Qin Guanghan spoke: "I think the force of the three tool heads is uneven."
    "Yes, that makes sense, sharpen the tool quickly!" Ma Xueli said.
    Ma Xueli had a temper. He never did anything behind closed doors, but always discussed it with everyone. He could listen to and remember any good opinions from others. After hearing Qin Guanghan's opinion, he quickly accepted it.
    A few tens of minutes later, the tool was sharpened, and the trepanning tool was put on the lathe for the second time. Soon, a whole two-meter-long, seventy-four-millimeter-thick round steel bar was trepanned out.
      An Unquenchable Flame
    Ma Xueli is a person who is good at learning and studies hard, and finally learned to manufacture trepanning tools; but Ma Xueli is also a person who is full of creativity. In 1958, a great leap forward was launched throughout the factory. The factory's annual plan jumped from forty-two units to two hundred units. In order to adapt to the needs of the Great Leap Forward, the labor organization of the workshop was adjusted. The Party organization considered that Ma Xueli was an old lathe operator, so in order to give full play to his role, he was transferred to the small and medium-sized parts workshop to be an adjuster (there are more small and medium-sized lathe machines), specifically helping to solve various technical operation problems.
    As soon as Ma Xueli arrived at the small and medium-sized parts workshop, he kept in mind the problem that the Party branch told him that the processing of worm gears could not keep up with the progress. To put it simply, worm gear processing is to machine very precise, deep and wide threads on a round steel material. Lathe operators Huang Zhiyu and Wu Jianmin were very laborious, and they were so tired that their backs ached all day, and they still couldn't finish one job.
    One day Huang Zhiyu came to Ma Xueli: "Master Ma, I heard that you are very good at innovation. Lao Wu and I want to improve the processing method of worm gears, do you think it will work?" Ma Xueli said: "Okay! Everyone come up with ideas, let's do it together." From then on, Ma Xueli, Huang Zhiyu, and Wu Jianmin joined a tense battle.
    If it is said that there were still materials brought back from the Soviet Union for trial-producing the trepanning tool, then there were not only no materials for improving the processing method of worm gears, but there was not even a shadow in their minds. They consulted many mechanical books, but there were no results. They pondered this matter all day long.
    One day, a milling machine in the workshop that was processing worm gears attracted Ma Xueli. He thought: "If a milling cutter is used on the lathe, and a motor is used to drive it to process worm gears, wouldn't it improve work efficiency?"
    Thinking and thinking, he hesitated: "If this would work, wouldn't people have done it long ago?!" Immediately he dispelled this idea: "If you don't dare to do what people haven't done before, how can there be innovation?" Then, he told the Party branch his plan. At this time, the branch gave him great encouragement.
    Ma Xueli took the sketches they had drawn themselves to the technology section for advice. The head of the technology section (Party committee member) sent technician Li Qiyuan to help them.
    Li Qiyuan is an energetic young technician. Under the influence of Ma Xueli and the others, he became even more motivated and often forgot to eat and sleep while drawing and designing. Li Shaochen, the director of the workshop, also personally participated in the battle. In this way, a "three-way combination" trial production began.
    The first experiment began. As a result, it didn't work. Ma Xueli wanted to replace it with a low-speed motor, but at this time someone poured cold water on him and said: "One motor costs more than a hundred yuan, do you know? Who knows if your experiment will succeed..."
    This basin of cold water did not extinguish Ma Xueli's flame of innovation. He thought: "To continuously make revolution and innovate, can we still bow our heads to difficulties?" "With the Party, with the masses, what difficulties cannot be overcome?" That night, he plunged into battle again.
    Several experiments passed, and the tool kept breaking as soon as the machine was started. Ma Xueli fell into deep thought. Where is the key? He was thinking while eating, thinking while sleeping, and thinking while walking. He was thinking about the ambition of the peasant Li Daguai to divert water to the mountains, he was thinking about the failures and successes of thousands of revolutionary heroes, and he was thinking about how the Party taught a Party member to overcome difficulties. ... "What do my difficulties count for!" He finally figured out the problem.
    Ma Xueli tried the machine again. He saw when he turned the main shaft by hand what speed didn't break the tool, and the answer was finally found.
    The problem was completely solved. The efficiency of worm gear processing was not only increased more than ten times, the quality was completely qualified, but also the labor intensity was greatly reduced. Wu Jianmin jumped up happily and said: "One year's task is completed in one month, we will take on the factory's worm gear task." The worker comrades all said with surprise and joy: "Skillful hands also need ingenious tools, hard work also needs good innovation!"
    Ma Xueli often said: "Technical innovation is like the sea, you can't dry it up no matter how much you pan." He was not satisfied with his existing achievements. After further improvements, the efficiency was increased by fourteen to sixteen times compared to the original.
      Never Proud or Complacent
    Ma Xueli couldn't wait to tell his colleagues even the slightest bit of experience he had gained in production.
    In late June of this year, Liu Qi, a lathe operator in the standard parts workshop, received a task to process a batch of large nuts. When processing this batch of work, steel tools were used first, and the speed was too slow. Then the internal eddy milling created by Ma Xueli was used, but the threads machined were still not up to standard. Liu Qi was very anxious.
    At more than nine o'clock in the evening, Ma Xueli was about to go home when Liu Qi came to find him. Ma Xueli didn't say a word and went to the standard parts workshop. He listened to Liu Qi's introduction of the situation, examined the tools and workpieces, and found that the tool was installed a little high. Ma Xueli helped Liu Qi solve one problem after another, and worked until late at night. As a result, the work that originally required two shifts to complete was completed in two hours.
    Ma Xueli's secret to helping others master advanced experience is patience. He never imposes his advanced experience on others. In September of last year, the Party branch studied the production situation of the workshop and found that the milling team two often lagged behind in progress at key points for several months, so it was decided to send Ma Xueli to help them.
    When Ma Xueli arrived at milling team two, he found that the team leader Xiong Shiwen had a stiff attitude. Ma Xueli said to Xiong Shiwen: "To improve the production of the team, technical innovation is important, but the primary thing is to do a good job in ideological work. You criticize people, your attitude is too stiff, people can't accept it. Hasn't the problem been solved yet? If you change your approach, talk to people individually more often, praise..." With Ma Xueli's help, Xiong Shiwen's attitude changed greatly, and production quickly caught up. Now, the whole team has achieved monthly completion of tasks ahead of schedule.
      "Over the years, how many technical innovations have you actually achieved?" Ma Xueli couldn't answer this question at all. Because no one can find a complete record of rationalization proposals, and he himself has never recorded them. In his opinion, "As long as the problems in production are solved, what does it matter if others don't know that I did it?" So he rarely fills out forms and reports them. According to the existing statistics from the leadership, Ma Xueli achieved 28 technical innovations in 1958, creating wealth of 120,000 yuan for the country; since 1959, he has achieved more than 60, of which the eddy milling reciprocating stroke cutting method and the milling open-end screw alone can create wealth of more than 160,000 yuan for the country in one year.
    Recently, the task he has set for himself is: to continue to constantly improve his socialist consciousness, listen to the Party in everything, play an exemplary and leading role everywhere, never be proud or complacent, honestly strive for the lofty ideal of communism, and ensure that he is a model communist Party member.

    马学礼
    中共武汉重型机床厂委员会写作小组
    一天，在武汉重型机床厂的技术革新展览会上，展出了一把新创造的样板刀，旁边还贴了一张大字报：“刘群觉悟高，革新办法好，加工吊车钩，创造样板刀，机器代人力，工效大提高”。大家正看得起劲，刘群却红着脸，嘴里直嚷嚷：“错啦！表扬错啦！”
    刘群一口气找到了马学礼。“马师傅，你的创造，为什么说成是我的呢？别人写错了！”
    “没有写错，大字报的材料是我提供的。”马学礼说。“事情本来就是你们干的。只要生产关键解决了，表扬你和表扬我又有什么不同呢？”马学礼还没把这件事情说完，工人彭茂堂也找来了。他告诉大家：“内孔梢胎也是马工长作的，大字报却表扬了我。”……
    这些新鲜事，很快就传到了党总支。于是总支书记就去找马学礼，问他到底是怎么一回事。谁知马学礼回答得既简单又明确：“我是个共产党员，又是工长，帮助工人解决生产技术问题本来就是我的职责，只要能鼓起大家的干劲，人家不知道我有什么关系呢？”
    后来，党支部到群众中去一了解，像这样的事，马学礼已经经历过十多次了，可是他一次也没有提到过自己。
    这是一种高尚的品德，要了解这种品质，还得从他的历史谈起。
  为社会主义——共产主义而战
    1931年的秋天，马学礼的家乡山东省发生了严重的蝗灾。衣食无着，他父亲拖着全家五口，“闯”了关东，到了沈阳。马学礼十一岁就进了一家日本人办的金属工厂当小工，一把鼻涕一把泪的，好容易才盼到日本投降。国民党来了，马学礼一家仍然生活在地狱里。一家人饿得实在不行，父亲捡了家里破破烂烂的衣服、被褥到乡下去换豆饼吃，结果又被土匪抢了，人被打得吐血；……
    解放了，天亮了。马学礼在1950年就考进沈阳机床一厂当车工，1951年提升为技工。工人再也没有挨打受气的事了，真正成了工厂的主人。
    党为了培养他，常给他锻炼、提高技术的机会。在工段长的具体帮助下，他的技术提高很快。1954年10月他光荣地参加了中国共产党。1956年，党又派他到苏联去学习。
    马学礼的阶级觉悟迅速提高了。他懂得了应该怎样对待劳动，怎样对待我们的崇高理想——共产主义。为社会主义—共产主义而战。这是马学礼的雄心大志。他照共产主义战士的标准要求自己。于是他对要给他领功的同志们说：“不！同志们，账应该这样记：这是党的功劳，是大家的功劳。”
    功劳给别人　困难给自己
    马学礼把功劳记在别人身上，遇到困难的时候，他却分毫不让，什么困难的任务只要交给他，他总是不讲价钱的。
    去年5月，工段里出现了重大关键——滑枕加工进度严重地落后了。滑枕约二米多长，要钻成直径一百三十三毫米的内孔；原来的加工方法，先用钻头钻孔，然后用车刀三番两次地扩大。尽管麻花钻改成了深孔钻，加工方法也作了一些改进，钻头还是容易断，进度还是赶不上，结果3月份投的料，到5月份还剩下一大半。更痛心的是，很多有用的钢材变成了废弃的铁屑。
    一天，加工滑枕的秦光汉找马学礼来了：“再给个人吧，咱师徒两顶一班，实在累的够呛！”马学礼又想起了在苏联见过的套料刀，干这种活既省力，工效又高，而且可以套出整根的钢料来。他从苏联回国时，还带回了一套图纸，交给了工厂的中央资料室。
    套料刀的事，不只是马学礼一个人提过。可是，拖了八个月，没有得到解决。马学礼也不止一次地找过有关部门，但是工具科的同志却说：“套料刀设计太复杂，要求又精密，制造有困难，还是钻吧！”这时候，马学礼再也按捺不住了。心想：“苏联能制造，我们有了苏联的资料难道不能制造吗？”他写了一张大字报：
      “套料刀拖了半年多，大好材料化铁末，工艺科啊工具科，你们到底作不作？如果你们怕困难，材料拿来我们作！”
    几天过去了，大字报像石沉大海，没有反应。马学礼想：“你们不相信，好吧！我们就作给你们看看。”决定试制套料刀的建议，马上得到了党组织的支持。总支书记见面就督促马学礼动手，还问有没有困难。
    套料刀试制开始了。经过几番努力，第一个套料刀上了车床。开始试验了，马学礼亲自操作着机床，几十双眼睛紧张地注视着他。一会，马学礼关车了，套料刀套不出料来。有人在旁冷言冷语地说：“人家厂里试装多少次都没有成功，你又何必费这大的劲呢？”
    马学礼站在机床旁边，寸步不移，那双皱着眉头的眼睛全神贯注地紧盯着套料刀。工人们一个也没有离开，都静静地苦思着。忽然秦光汉开了腔：“我看是三个刀头的力量不均匀。”
    “对，有道理，快磨刀吧！”马学礼说。
    马学礼有个脾气，干什么都不是关着门一个人干，总是和大伙一起商量。别人有一点好意见他都能听进去、记在心头。他听到秦光汉的意见后，很快就接受了。
    几十分钟以后，刀磨好了，套料刀第二次上了床子。不久，一整根二米多长、七十四个毫米粗的圆钢被套出来了。
      扑不灭的火焰
    马学礼是个善于学习的人，刻苦钻研，终于学会了制造套料刀；但马学礼更是个富于创造的人。1958年，全厂掀起了大跃进的热潮。工厂的年计划由四十二台跃进到二百台。为了适应大跃进的需要，车间的劳动组织进行了调整。党组织考虑到马学礼是老车工，为了更充分地发挥他的作用，把他调到中小件工部去当调整工（中小件车床较多），具体帮助解决技术操作上的各种问题。
    马学礼一来到中小件工部，就一直留心党支部告诉他的加工蜗杆赶不上进度的问题。蜗杆加工简单说来，就是要在滚圆的钢料上，车出非常精密的又深又宽的螺纹来。车工黄志雨和吴健民十分吃力，一天累得腰酸背痛，还车不完一个活。
    一天黄志雨找马学礼：“马师傅，听说你搞革新很有办法，老吴和我想改进蜗杆的加工方法，你说行吗？”马学礼说：“行！大家都来想办法，我们一起干吧。”从此，马学礼就和黄志雨、吴健民一道，投入了一场紧张的战斗。
    如果说，试制套料刀还有从苏联带回来的资料，那么改进蜗杆的加工方法，不仅没有资料，脑子里连影子也没有。他们翻阅了许多机械书籍，也没有结果。他们成天琢磨这件事。
    一天，车间里的一台正在加工蜗杆的铣床吸引住马学礼。他想：“如果车床上用铣刀，用一个马达来带动它加工蜗杆，不就可以提高工作效率了吗？”
    想着想着，他犹豫了：“要这样能行，人家不早就搞了？！”马上他又打消了这种想法：“要是人家没有干过的，就不敢干，哪能有革新？”接着，他把他的打算告诉了党支部。这时，支部又给了他很大的鼓励。
    马学礼拿着他们自己画好的草图去工艺科求教。工艺科长（党委委员）派了技术员李启元帮助他们。
    李启元是一个精力充沛的青年技术员，在马学礼他们的影响下，干劲更足，绘图设计，常常废寝忘食。工部主任李绍臣也亲自参加战斗。就这样，一场“三结合”的试制开始了。
    第一次试验开始了。结果，不行。马学礼想换一个低速马达，这时有人泼冷水地说：“一个马达一百多块，你知不知道？谁知道你那个试验能不能成功。……”
    这瓢冷水并没有扑灭马学礼革新的火焰。他想：“要不断革命，不断革新，还能向困难低头吗？”“有党，有群众，还有什么困难不能克服吗？”当天夜里，又投入战斗。
    几次试验过去了，老是一开车子刀子就打坏了，马学礼陷入了沉思。关键在哪里呢？吃饭在想，睡觉在想，走路也在想。他在想农民李大贵引水上山的志气，他在想千千万万革命英雄的失败与成功，他在想党是怎样教导一个党员克服困难。……“我的困难算得了什么！”他终于想出问题来了。
    马学礼再上机床试验，他用手转动主轴看到什么转手才不打坏刀子，答案终于找到了。
    问题完全解决了。蜗杆加工不仅工效提高了十多倍，质量完全合格，而且劳动强度也大大地降低了。吴健民喜的跳起来说：“一年任务一个月完成，全厂的蜗杆任务，我们包下来。”工人同志们都带着惊异和喜悦的神色说：“手巧还要工具妙，苦干还要革新好！”
    马学礼常说：“技术革新像大海，怎么也淘不干。”他并没有满足已有的成就。经过进一步的改进，工效比原来又提高了十四倍到十六倍。
      永远不骄傲不自满
    马学礼在生产中所得到的体会心得，那怕是一点一滴，都恨不得一下子都告诉同行。
    今年6月下旬，标准件车间的车工刘启接到加工一批大螺帽任务。在加工这批活的时候，先用的钢刀，速度太慢，后用马学礼创造的内旋风铣，车出的螺纹还是不合规格。刘启很焦急。
    晚上九点多钟，马学礼正准备回家，刘启来找他。马学礼二话没说，就上标准件车间来了。他听了刘启介绍的情况，端详了刀具和工件，发现刀子装得高了一点。马学礼帮助刘启解决一个问题又一个问题，一直干到深夜。结果这批原来需要两个班才能干完的活，两个小时就干完了。
    马学礼帮助别人掌握先进经验的秘诀就是耐心。他从不把自己的先进经验强加于人。去年9月间，党支部研究工部的生产情况，发现铣工二组有几个月在关键上常拉进度，便决定派马学礼去帮助他们。
    马学礼到了铣工二组，发现组长熊诗文态度生硬。马学礼对熊诗文说：“要把小组的生产搞好，革新技术是重要，但是首要的是作好思想工作。你批评人，态度太生硬，人家接受不了。还不是没解决问题，如果换个方式，多进行个别谈话多，表扬……”在马学礼的帮助下，熊诗文的态度有了很大转变，生产也很快赶上来了。现在，全组已经做到了月月提前完成任务。
      “这些年来，你究竟实现了多少项技术革新？”马学礼根本答不出这个问题。因为合理化建议谁也查不到完整的记录，他自己也从没有记这些，在他看来，“只要解决了生产上的问题，别人不知道是我搞的，有什么关系呢？”所以很少填表上报。据领导上现有的统计是：马学礼实现的技术革新，1958年有二十八项，为国家创造财富十二万元；1959年以来，实现了六十多项，其中仅就旋风铣往返行程吃刀法和铣开口螺丝两项，一年就能为国家创造财富十六万多元。
    最近，他给自己提出的任务是：继续不断地提高自己的社会主义觉悟，事事听党的话，处处起模范带头作用，永远不骄傲不自满，老老实实地为共产主义崇高理想而奋斗，保证作一个模范共产党员。
