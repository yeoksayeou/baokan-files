Xinhua News Agency, 20th – The Chinese People's Liberation Army's various units achieved fruitful results last year in implementing the system of cadres serving as soldiers. Cadres said, "A month in the company is better than ten years of reading." After serving as soldiers in the companies, the ideological and work styles of cadres in various units were further improved, thereby strengthening the relationship between officers and soldiers and promoting a great leap forward in various tasks.

The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army stipulated in September 1958 that cadres should serve as soldiers in companies for a period of time. Party committees at all levels regarded this regulation as a major measure to implement Chairman Mao's military thought and promote the glorious tradition of unity between officers and soldiers in the People's Army, resolutely implementing it and earnestly executing it. Over the past year, the vast majority of cadres in various units, except for those who were old and frail, served as soldiers in the companies. These cadres included commanders and political commissars of military branches, services, and military regions, leaders of armies, divisions, and regiments, and office cadres, as well as a large number of grassroots cadres such as company commanders, political instructors, and platoon leaders. Tens of thousands of young officers from intellectual backgrounds also served as soldiers in the companies for three months to a year.

"It is infinitely good to be a soldier," is the common experience of cadres who have served as soldiers. Many cadres said in summarizing their gains from serving as soldiers: What we gained was communist ideology, and what we lost were "three styles and five airs." Some veteran cadres who had been away from company life for a long time felt younger after drilling and working with the soldiers. An old general wrote in a poem: "The company is a university, with military, political, and cultural knowledge all-encompassing; the soldiers' enthusiasm breaks through the sky, vigorous and heroic; we come to the company as students, learning all the advantages." A large number of young intellectual cadres who joined the army after liberation received even greater training during their service as soldiers, and their ideological and emotional changes were also significant. Jiao Yufu, a young officer from a unit in the Guangzhou area, took the initiative to work overtime during guard duty when he saw that there were few people and the task was heavy while performing bridge guarding duties with his unit. Young officers from the Wuhan area who served as soldiers in the companies jumped into the bone-chilling river to repair a bridge in the face of snow, ice, and howling winds. Cadres from a certain logistics school who served as truck drivers in the transportation units on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau often ate and slept in the trucks with the soldiers, taking turns driving, rushing day and night, personally witnessing the communist ideological character of the soldiers, and experiencing the glory of labor, breaking the conceited idea that "all trades are inferior, only studying is superior." Many people believe that the company is the best school, and the soldiers are the best teachers, where they can learn things that cannot be learned from books.

"When you serve as a soldier in the company, you see the problems clearly." After serving as soldiers, cadres at all levels strengthened their concept of loving soldiers and improved their leadership styles. Because they ate, lived, drilled, and worked with the soldiers during their time in the companies, and talked about their families and backgrounds together, they understood the feelings of the soldiers even more. Many people achieved "ideological communication with the soldiers, and work rooted in the company," greatly strengthening the connection between the offices and the companies. The leading organs of the Jinan area troops also used the materials accumulated by the cadres serving as soldiers to guide the work of the companies, solving many major problems for the coastal defense troops. Some company commanders, platoon leaders, and other grassroots cadres also improved their leadership styles and working methods after being trained as soldiers. Sun Yingju, the company commander of a certain unit, said, "What the soldiers like are cadres who are not impulsive, do not lose their temper, and are serious and responsible in their work." Later, he became more careful and patient in listening to the soldiers' opinions in his work, and he could humbly consult with the masses on matters.

A large number of cadres went to the companies to serve as soldiers, using their practical actions to conduct revolutionary tradition education for the broad masses of soldiers. The broad masses of soldiers repeatedly praised the examples of the generals getting along with them intimately during their service as soldiers and their teachings, using them to motivate themselves to maintain and carry forward the glorious traditions of the People's Army. Some companies continued to put out wall newspapers on "catching up with the generals" after the generals left, and many squads and platoons also launched a wave of learning from the "old Red Army" and "old Eighth Route Army." Deng Guanhai, the political instructor of a battalion in a unit of the Guangzhou area troops, marched long distances with the soldiers during his service as a soldier, his feet were covered with blisters, and he endured the pain of wading through the water when crossing the river, and also carried several soldiers whose feet had blisters. The soldiers were moved and composed songs to sing: "Cadres serve as soldiers, carrying forward the old traditions, officers and soldiers are of one heart, and the whole army is red." Some soldiers who had incorrect views on their work were also deeply educated through the cadre service. A cook in a certain unit used to think that his job was not decent, and he was embarrassed to write about what he did when filling out forms and writing letters home. After the director of the regiment's logistics department served as a soldier in the squad, his thinking improved, and he realized that cooking was part of the revolutionary work, and it was a glorious position and honorable person.

Because the cadre service system greatly encouraged the broad masses of soldiers, it further promoted the work of the troops in all aspects. Last year, many units became "all-red" companies, "excellent" platoons, and "five-good" squads. The soldiers praised this situation, saying: "Officers and soldiers work together on rockets, and the leap forward red flag is especially red."

### 解放军广大干部下连当兵获得思想工作双丰收  密切了官兵关系  改进了领导作风  战士歌唱道：干部当列兵，发扬老传统，官兵一条心，上下一片红

    解放军广大干部下连当兵获得思想工作双丰收
    密切了官兵关系  改进了领导作风
    战士歌唱道：干部当列兵，发扬老传统，官兵一条心，上下一片红
    新华社20日讯　中国人民解放军各部队去年在贯彻干部当兵制度中，取得了丰硕的收获。干部们说：“下连一个月，胜读十年书”。经过到连队当兵后，各部队干部思想作风和工作作风进一步改进，并从而密切了官兵关系，促进了各项工作的大跃进。
    干部下连队当兵一个时期，是解放军总政治部在1958年9月规定的。各级党委都把这一规定作为贯彻毛主席军事思想，发扬人民军队官兵一致光荣传统的重大措施，坚决贯彻，认真执行。一年来，各部队干部除年老体衰的以外，绝大多数都下连当了兵。这些干部中有军种、兵种、军区的司令员、政治委员，有军、师、团的首长和机关干部，还有连长、指导员、排长等大批基层干部。数万名知识分子出身的青年军官，也到连队当了三个月到一年的士兵。
    “当兵无限好”，是下连当兵干部的共同体会。许多干部在总结当兵收获时说：我们得到的是共产主义思想，失掉的是“三风五气”。一些离开连队生活较久的老干部，在同战士一起操课、共同劳动以后，觉得自己变得年青了。一位老将军在诗里写道：“连队是个大学校，军、政、文化一大套，战士干劲冲破天，生龙活虎逞英豪，我们下连当学生，一切优点都学到。”大批解放后参军的青年知识分子干部，在下连当兵期间受到的锻炼更大，他们思想感情发生的变化也很显著。广州地区某部青年军官焦玉福，随同部队执行守桥任务，看到人少、任务重，放哨时主动加班多站。武汉地区部队下连当兵的青年军官，在冰雪交加、寒风怒号的天气里，和士兵一起跳下刺骨冷的河水里抢修大桥。在青藏高原运输部队当汽车兵的某后勤学校的干部，经常和战士们一起在车上吃、车上睡，轮换开车，昼夜赶路，亲自看到战士们的共产主义思想品德，体会到劳动的光荣，打破了“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的清高思想。许多人认为：连队是最好的学校，战士是最好的教员，可以学到从书本上学不到的东西。
    “下连当了兵，问题看得清”，各级干部经过下连当兵，加强了爱兵观念，改进了领导作风。由于他们在连队期间，和战士们同吃、同住、同操课、同劳动，一起谈家常、道身世，更加了解了士兵的心情。许多人做到了“思想和战士通气，工作到连队扎根”，大大加强了机关和连队的联系。济南地区部队领导机关，还运用下连队当兵干部积累的材料指导连队工作，为海防部队解决了许多重大问题。一些连长、排长等基层干部，经过下班当兵的锻炼，也改进了自己的领导作风和工作方法。某部连长孙英举说：“士兵喜欢的是不冒火，不发脾气，工作认真负责的干部。”以后他在工作中更加细心、耐心地倾听士兵的意见，有事能虚心地跟群众商量。
    大批干部到连队当兵，用实际行动对广大士兵进行了革命传统教育。广大战士把将军们下连当兵期间同他们亲密相处的事例和他们的教导，一遍遍地传颂，用来激励自己保持和发扬人民军队的光荣传统。有的连队在将军走后，继续一期期地出“赶将军”的墙报，许多班、排还展开了向“老红军”、“老八路”学习的热潮。广州地区部队某部营教导员邓观海，当兵期间和战士一起长途行军，双脚打满了血泡，过河时忍着疼痛趟水，还背过几个两脚磨了泡的士兵，战士们感动得编歌曲唱道：“干部当列兵，发扬老传统，官兵一条心，上下一片红。”一些对自己工作有不正确看法的士兵，也通过干部当兵受到深刻教育。某部有个炊事兵，过去认为自己的工作不体面，填表写家信都不好意思写出自己干什么工作，团后勤主任到班里当兵以后，他的思想提高了，认识到炊事工作是革命工作的一部分，是光荣的岗位，荣誉的人。
    由于干部当兵制度对广大士兵有极大鼓舞，进一步推动了部队各方面工作。去年，许多单位成了“满堂红”连、“优秀”排和“五好”班，战士们歌颂这种局面说：“官兵并肩跨火箭，跃进红旗格外红。”（附图片）
