Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: The National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" held a meeting in Tokyo yesterday, deciding to continue strengthening the struggle against the "Security Treaty." Three hundred representatives from various regions participating in the 11th unified action attended the meeting.

The meeting unanimously agreed that, going forward, it is necessary to more broadly mobilize people from all walks of life to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new "Security Treaty."

The meeting decided that the local organizations of the National Conference will immediately strengthen propaganda through various methods, organize the broad masses to participate in rallies held in all parts of the country from the beginning of February and the national march to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new "Security Treaty." This activity plan was adopted at the third national representative conference held by the National Conference at the end of last year.

At yesterday's meeting, representatives from various regions reported on the increasingly high tide of the people's struggle in various prefectures against the revision of the "Security Treaty." According to reports, during the 11th unified action, 30,000 and 20,000 people participated in rallies in Osaka and Kobe respectively, and 16,000 and 10,000 people participated in Nagoya and Hiroshima respectively; Fukuoka Prefecture held rallies in eighteen locations; Shizuoka Prefecture held demonstrations in nine locations from the 9th, with a total of 120,000 participants; Fukushima Prefecture held protest rallies simultaneously in ten locations. In addition, unprecedented large-scale rallies and demonstrations were also successfully held in small and medium-sized cities such as Nagaoka City and Choshi City.

Participants at the meeting also exchanged experiences on how joint struggle organizations in various regions creatively mobilized the masses to participate in the struggle.

The joint struggle organization in Shimonoseki City strengthened propaganda to fishermen, and as a result, eighteen of the twenty-nine fishermen leaders changed their original attitudes and joined the joint struggle organization.

The joint struggle organization in Hiroshima City expanded propaganda against the "Security Treaty" and raised people's political awareness by visiting families and distributing leaflets.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: The National Conference for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations adopted a future course of action at its national representative conference held in Tokyo yesterday. The course of action stipulates that the National Conference will organize the immense power of the masses to wage a struggle that closely combines the effort to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations with the prevention of the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The course of action also stipulates that the National Conference will launch a propaganda campaign to expose the vicious nature of the propaganda recently spread by the Kishi Nobusuke government and some members of the ruling party that "Japan-China relations will be opened up after the Security Treaty is revised." The course of action points out that these people are plotting to create such a vicious public opinion, attempting to deceive the people by suggesting that the deadlock in Japan-China relations can be broken even after the "Security Treaty" is revised.

The course of action stipulates that during the month-long peace march held by the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in various prefectures from the beginning of February, the National Conference for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations will focus on efforts to awaken public opinion in favor of restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations.

Kazami Akira, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National Conference for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, stated in his speech at the meeting that, in order to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations, it is necessary to implement the principles of not allowing the revision of the "Security Treaty" and not allowing the creation of "two Chinas," and absolutely not to cooperate with politicians who support the revision of the "Security Treaty" and "two Chinas."

Kamiyama Shigeo, representative of the Japanese Communist Party, and Hozumi Shichiro, representative of the Socialist Party, also spoke at the meeting. They stated that the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party will make every effort to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations within this year.

    据新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议昨天在东京举行会议，决定继续加强反对“安全条约”的斗争。参加第十一次统一行动的各地代表三百人出席了这次会议。
    会议一致认为，今后必须更广泛地发动各阶层的人民，来阻止国会批准新的“安全条约”。
    会议决定，国民会议的各地组织将以各种方法立即加强宣传，组织广大人民参加从2月初在全国所有地方举行的集会和阻止国会批准新“安全条约”的国民大游行。这项活动计划是国民会议在去年年底召开的第三次全国代表会议上通过的。
    在昨天的会议上，各地代表们报告了各府、县人民群众反对修改“安全条约”的斗争日益高涨的情况。据报告，在第十一次统一行动中，大阪和神户分别有三万人和二万人，名古屋和广岛分别有一万六千人和一万人参加了集会；福冈县在十八个地方举行了集会；静冈县从9日起在九个地方举行了共有十二万人参加的示威游行；福岛县在十个地方同时举行了抗议集会。此外，在长冈市和铫子市等中小城市也胜利地举行了空前未有的大规模集会和示威游行。
    与会者在会上还交流了各地共同斗争组织发挥创造性、组织人民群众参加斗争的经验。
    下关市共同斗争组织加强对渔民的宣传，结果二十九家渔民头领中有十八家改变原来的态度，参加了共同斗争组织。
    广岛市共同斗争组织通过访问家庭和散发传单，扩大了反对“安全条约”的宣传，提高了人们的政治觉悟。
    据新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本恢复日中邦交国民会议昨天在东京举行的全国代表会议上通过了今后的运动方针。方针规定，国民会议将组织人民群众巨大的力量，把争取恢复日中邦交同阻止修改日美“安全条约”密切结合起来展开斗争。
    运动方针还规定，国民会议要展开宣传运动，揭露岸信介政府和执政党一部分人士最近散布的“在安全条约修改后要打开日中关系”的宣传的恶毒本质。方针指出，这些人阴谋制造这样一种恶毒的舆论，即使在修改“安全条约”以后也能够打开日中关系僵局，企图欺骗人民。
    方针规定，在阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议从2月初开始在全国各府、县举行为期一个月的和平大游行期间，恢复日中邦交国民会议将着重努力唤起争取恢复日中邦交的舆论。
    恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章在会上发表的讲话中表示，为了打开日中关系僵局，必须贯彻不容许修改“安全条约”和不容许制造“两个中国”的原则，绝对不和赞同修改“安全条约”和“两个中国”的政治家合作。
    日本共产党代表神山茂夫和社会党代表穗积七郎也分别在会上讲话。他们表示，日本共产党和社会党将全力为阻止修改“安全条约”和为在今年内打开日中关系僵局而努力。
