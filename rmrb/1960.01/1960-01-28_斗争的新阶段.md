    New Stage of Struggle
    Lan Hai
    The Kishi Nobusuke group, disregarding the opposition of the Japanese people and the righteous public opinion of the world, went to the United States to sign the new Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty—the "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security." The 34th ordinary session of the Diet, which reconvened in late January, will include the ratification of this new treaty as its main agenda item. Facing this situation, the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has entered a new stage.
  Currently, the Japanese people are struggling to prevent the Diet from ratifying this new military treaty. Centered on the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party, "Sohyo" and other labor unions, peace and democracy groups, as well as farmers, citizens, youth, students, scholars, actors, religious figures, and other broad strata, have actively engaged in this struggle. Since January 24th, the National Council Against Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" issued a statement strongly condemning Kishi Nobusuke for signing a new military treaty with the United States, and expressed its intention to immediately organize protest struggles: In February, national mass marches to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" will be held in all prefectures; when the Diet begins its deliberations, large-scale protest rallies will be held simultaneously across the country; and large-scale unified actions centered on workers' strikes will be launched to prevent the Diet from ratifying the treaty. The Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament and the world's people's movement to defend peace have further strengthened the Japanese people's will and confidence in their struggle. In the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," the Japanese people have greatly demonstrated increasingly significant unity and progress in thought and organization. The more stubbornly the Kishi Nobusuke group carries out the conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty," the deeper it sinks into isolation.
    Kishi Nobusuke's trip to the United States to sign the new Japan-U.S. military treaty is the most disgraceful page in the history of Japanese diplomacy.
    The circumstances of the "plenipotentiary delegation" led by Kishi Nobusuke's departure for the United States were extremely embarrassing. Fearing the angry tide of protests from the Japanese people, Kishi Nobusuke and his party initially decided to depart from Haneda Airport at 10:30 p.m. on January 16th, but suddenly changed the departure time to 8:00 a.m. the day before. On the morning of the 16th, Kishi Nobusuke and other "plenipotentiary commissioners" departed from the Prime Minister's official residence under the protection of armed police. Their cars dared not take the main road to Haneda Airport, but instead, wound around seven or eight times, drove at full speed into the airport runway, and hurriedly got into the plane. Several hours before their takeoff, five thousand armed police drove about a thousand students sitting in the airport lounge outdoors and unreasonably arrested seventy-seven students.
    According to common sense, the prime minister of a country and the "plenipotentiary delegation" he leads should travel abroad in a legitimate and upright manner. However, Kishi Nobusuke and his party did not dare to announce even the departure time until just before their departure, and under the protection of thousands of armed police, they sneaked away by plane like fugitives. At the airport, there was neither a farewell from cabinet ministers, nor did foreign embassies in Japan send representatives to see them off. Such a cold reception was unprecedented. Even the Japanese bourgeois newspapers ridiculed Kishi Nobusuke for losing face completely.
    The reason why Kishi Nobusuke and his party's visit to the United States was so embarrassing is that the Japanese people have demonstrated an undeniable fighting force in the past eleven unified actions to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."
    On December 25th last year, representatives from eight hundred joint struggle organizations against the revision of the "Security Treaty" across the country gathered in Tokyo to discuss the struggle plan for January of this year. The climax of the anti-revision of the "Security Treaty" movement last year was the eighth national unified action on November 27th. In the eighth unified action, 100,000 people in Tokyo conducted a petition struggle to the Diet. The panicked Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party attacked the workers and students who flocked to the vicinity of the Diet as "rioters" and forcibly enacted a reactionary bill within the Diet relying on their majority to prohibit demonstrations around the Diet.
    However, this approach by the Japanese reactionaries cannot weaken the Japanese people's fighting spirit. While advocating the convening of a national activists conference, the Japanese Communist Party convened a mass rally organized solely by the party as one of the tenth national unified actions. Despite the extremely short preparation time, this conference still mobilized more than two thousand workers and citizens and held a well-organized lantern parade on the night of December 22nd. This action gave great encouragement to the cadres of various democratic groups. As a result, the national activists conference held on December 25th unanimously adopted the resolution proposed by the Japanese Communist Party: "On the eve of Kishi Nobusuke's visit to the United States, a massive unified action will be launched nationwide." The conference also decided that in welcoming the new year of 1960, the eleventh national unified action would be held from January 14th to 16th. The "Gunma Prefecture Citizens' League for the Defense of Democracy," a joint struggle organization in Gunma Prefecture against the revision of the "Security Treaty," opened the prelude to the eleventh unified action. On January 10th, this organization convened a county-wide mobilization rally in Takasaki City. As many as 20,000 workers, peasants, and citizens participated in the rally. The conference also selected representatives to attend the Tokyo Conference on January 14th. Subsequently, a new climax emerged in the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" throughout Japan. On January 14th, three thousand representatives from across the country convened a "Central Protest Rally Against Kishi Nobusuke's Trip to the United States to Sign the Treaty" in Tokyo. On the afternoon of the 16th, the day Kishi Nobusuke left for the United States, more than 30,000 workers gathered in five locations in Tokyo, braving the cold wind and rain to hold a demonstration.
    An important sign of the new high tide of struggle is the unprecedented expansion of the ranks participating in the struggle and the frequency of activities. The "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty Criticism Society," organized by famous writers, actors, and artists, held a parade with 450 participants on January 11th. On the 12th, the "Women's Council for the Protection of Human Rights," organized by 44 women's groups, held a protest rally, demanding that the wives of Kishi Nobusuke and Fujiyama oppose Kishi Nobusuke's trip to the United States to sign the treaty. On the 13th, the "Lawyers' Conference to Prevent Revision of the 'Security Treaty'," organized by 1,500 legal professionals, submitted an opinion to the Kishi Nobusuke government stating that "the revision of the 'Security Treaty' violates the Constitution." Immediately afterwards, on the 15th, religious figures, who had not been very concerned about political and social issues, also held a demonstration. On this day, the "United Christian Peace Association" held a protest rally and demonstration, attended by 900 representatives from 150 churches in Tokyo. During the parade, they shook hands and celebrated with another procession of alms seekers organized by representatives of the "Buddhist Peace Council." The scene at that time was very touching. In addition, Aiyi Tajiri, who once served as the Japanese Minister to foreign countries, published an article in the "Asahi Journal" (weekly) published on January 10, pointing out that "revising the 'Security Treaty' carries the danger of openly joining an anti-communist military alliance." Nishi Haruhiko, former Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, also published an article in the February 1960 issue of "Chuo Koron," published in late January, linking the Japan-Germany-Italy fascist military alliance during World War II and pointing out the dangers of the Japan-U.S. military alliance. These two famous figures' articles have caused huge repercussions in Japan. Because their opposition to revising the "Security Treaty" shows how unpopular the conspiracy of the Japan-U.S. reactionaries to conclude a military alliance is.
    The 34th ordinary session of the Diet reconvened in late January and will continue until mid-May. It is an undeniable fact that the Kishi Nobusuke group is very worried about the future of this Diet session. In order to enable the Diet to ratify the new Japan-U.S. military treaty, the Kishi Nobusuke group does not intend to submit other important bills at this Diet session except for the new fiscal year's budget bill. However, the new fiscal year's budget bill, which amounts to more than 1,569.6 billion yen and focuses on increasing military expenditures, has already aroused great dissatisfaction among the people. The opposition parties have decided to thoroughly investigate the budget bill and the new Japan-U.S. military treaty at the Diet session, and the calls for refusing to deliberate the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet are growing stronger. With Kishi Nobusuke's increasing isolation, the factional struggles within the Liberal Democratic Party for the next president have become more intense, and calls for Kishi Nobusuke to step down are also rising. Bourgeois newspapers such as the "Tokyo Shimbun" have also put forward the proposition of "dissolving the Diet and seeking the trust of the people before the Diet ratifies the new Security Treaty."
    At present, the domestic and international situation in Japan is, generally speaking, beneficial to the Japanese people's struggle for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality. The Japanese people's just struggle has received enthusiastic support from the Soviet Union, China, and peace-loving people all over the world. However, as the Japanese Communist Party, which stands at the forefront of the struggle, has pointed out, opposing the revision and striving for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a long-term and arduous struggle. In order to win the final victory of the struggle, the primary condition is to make the vast majority of people fully aware of the great political significance of the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" and to continuously strengthen the unity of the people. Countless facts in the past have fully proven the truth that "unity is strength." This truth has been increasingly grasped by millions of Japanese people. Millions of Japanese people united under the banner of striving for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality will surely achieve newer achievements in the new year of 1960.

    斗争的新阶段
    蓝海
    岸信介集团不顾日本人民和世界正义舆论的反对，跑到美国去在新的日美军事同盟条约——“共同合作和安全条约”上画了押。从1月下旬起复会的第三十四次国会平时会议，将把批准这一新条约的问题列为它的主要议程。面对着这样的局面，日本各界人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，就进入了一个新的阶段。
  目前，日本人民正在为阻止国会批准这一新的军事条约而斗争。以日本共产党、社会党为中心，“总评”和其它工会、和平民主团体以及农民、市民、青年学生、学者、演员、宗教界人士等广泛阶层，都积极投入了这一斗争。自24日，日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议发表声明，强烈谴责岸信介同美国签订新的军事条约，并表示立即组织抗议斗争：2月间将在全国各县举行阻止批准新“安全条约”的国民大游行；在国会开始审议时，将在全国同时举行规模巨大的抗议大会；并准备展开以工人阶级的罢工为中心的大规模统一行动来阻止国会批准这项条约。苏联的全面彻底裁军建议和世界人民保卫和平的运动，使日本人民的斗争意志和信心更为加强了。日本人民在阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争中，大大显示出了思想上和组织上日益显著的团结和进步。岸信介集团越是顽固地进行修改“安全条约”的阴谋，就越深地陷于孤立的境地。
    岸信介赴美签署日美新军事条约，是日本外交史上最不光彩的一页。
    岸信介率领的“全权代表团”动身去美国的情况是十分狼狈的。慑于日本人民的抗议怒潮，岸信介一行人起初决定在1月16日下午十时半由羽田机场动身启程，但是在临行前一天的下午突然把动身的时间改为上午八时。16日早上，岸信介等“全权委员”，在武装警察的护卫下从首相公馆出发。他们的汽车不敢走通往羽田机场的大路，而是七绕八绕，开足马力溜进机场的跑道，匆匆地钻进了飞机。在他们起飞数小时以前，有五千名武装警察把坐在机场休息室里的一千名左右的学生赶出室外，并且无理地逮捕了七十七名学生。
    按常情说来，堂堂一国的首相和他所率领的“全权代表团”出国应该是光明正大的。但是，岸信介一行人却连出发时间直到启行前都不敢宣布，而且在数千名武装警察的保护下像逃犯一般坐着飞机溜走。在机场上，既没有内阁大臣们的欢送，外国驻日使馆也几乎没有派代表送行。这种冷落的情景是空前未有的。连日本资产阶级报纸也都嘲笑岸信介丢尽了脸。
    岸信介一行人的访美所以如此狼狈，是因为日本人民在过去的十一次阻止修改“安全条约”统一行动中显示了不可忽视的战斗力量。
    去年12月25日，全国八百个反对修改“安全条约”共同斗争组织的代表在东京集会，讨论了今年1月的斗争方针。去年反对修改“安全条约”运动的最高潮，是11月27日的第八次全国统一行动。在第八次统一行动中，东京有十万人进行了国会请愿斗争。惊慌失措的岸信介政府和自由民主党，攻击涌到国会附近的工人和学生是“暴徒”，并在国会内依靠多数势力强行制定了禁止在国会周围示威游行的反动法案。
    但是，日本反动派的这种做法，并不能削弱日本人民的斗志。日本共产党在倡议召开全国活动家会议的同时，作为第十次全国统一行动之一，召开了由党单独组织的群众大会。尽管准备时间异常短促，这次大会仍然动员了二千多名工人和市民，并且于12月22日夜里举行了步伐齐整的提灯示威游行。这一行动给了各民主团体的干部极大的鼓舞。结果在12月25日召开的全国活动家会议，一致通过了日本共产党提出的决议案：“在岸信介访美前夕，全国开展声势浩大的统一行动”。会议并决定在迎接新的1960年时，从1月14日起到16日止，举行第十一次全国统一行动。揭开第十一次统一行动序幕的是群马县反对修改“安全条约”的共同斗争组织“群马县县民拥护民主联合会”。1月10日，这个组织在高崎市召开了县民总动员大会。参加大会的工人、农民和市民达两万人。这次大会并且选出了参加1月14日东京大会的代表。接着，日本各地反对修改“安全条约”斗争又出现了新的高潮。1月14日，来自全国的三千名代表在东京召开了“反对岸信介赴美签字的中央抗议大会”。在岸信介动身赴美的16日当天下午，在东京都内五个地方集聚的三万多工人，冒着寒风冷雨举行了示威游行。
    斗争新高潮的一个重要标志，就是参加斗争的队伍空前扩大和活动频繁。著名的文学家、演员、美术家等组织的“日美安全条约批判会”，在1月11日举行一次有四百五十人参加的游行。12日，由四十四个妇女团体组织的“保卫人权妇女协议会”举行抗议大会，向岸信介和藤山的妻子提出反对岸信介赴美画押的要求。13日，由一千五百名法律界人士组织的“阻止修改‘安全条约’法律家会议”，向岸信介政府提出了“修改‘安全条约’违反宪法”的意见书。紧接着在15日，对政治和社会问题一直不太关心的宗教界人士，也举行了示威游行。在这一天，“基督教和平团体联合会”举行抗议大会和示威游行，参加的有东京都内的一百五十个教会的九百名代表。他们在游行途中同另一起由“佛教徒和平协议会”代表举行的托钵游行的队伍握手联欢。当时的情景是十分感人的。此外，曾经担任过日本驻外公使的田尻爱义在1月10日出版的“朝日杂志”（周刊）上发表论文，指出“修改‘安全条约’有公然参加反共军事同盟的危险”。前日本驻英大使西春彦在1月下旬出版的1960年2月号“中央公论”上也发表文章，联系第二次世界大战中的日德意法西斯军事同盟，指出日美军事同盟的危害性。这两位著名人士的文章，在日本都引起了巨大的反响。因为他们的反对修改“安全条约”，表明日美反动派缔结军事同盟的阴谋，多么不得人心。
    第三十四次国会平时会议在1月下旬复会，将继续到5月中旬为止。岸信介集团对这次国会的前途十分担忧，已是掩饰不了的事实。岸信介集团为了使国会能够批准新的日美军事条约，在这次国会会议上除了提出新年度的预算案外，不准备再提出其他重要的议案。但是，以增加军费开支为中心的高达一万五千六百九十六亿多日元的新年度预算案，已经引起人民极大的不满。在野党决定在国会会议上彻底追究预算案和新日美军事条约，拒绝在国会审议新“安全条约”的呼声日益强烈。随着岸信介的日益孤立，自由民主党内部争夺下届总裁的派系斗争愈加激烈，要求岸信介下台的呼声也不断高涨。“东京新闻”等资产阶级报纸也提出了“在国会批准新安全条约之前，解散国会，取信于民”的主张。
    目前日本国内外的形势，总的说来对于日本人民争取和平、独立、民主、中立的斗争是有利的。日本人民的正义斗争得到苏中及全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持。但是，正如站在斗争最前线的日本共产党所指出的，反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”，是一个长期艰巨的斗争。为了赢得斗争的最后胜利，首要的条件就是使广大人民充分认识反对修改“安全条约”斗争的巨大政治意义和不断加强人民的团结。过去的无数事实完全证明了“团结就是力量”的真理。这一真理已经日益为千百万的日本人民所掌握。团结在争取和平、独立、民主、中立旗帜下的千百万日本人民，在新的1960年定将取得更新的成就。
