    Studying Mao Zedong Thought and Fully Developing Conscious Dynamism
    Jiang Weiqing
    I.
    Our people have victoriously entered a new decade and are striving with full confidence to realize the continued leap forward in 1960 and to build our country into a strong socialist nation with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible. Looking back at 1959, Jiangsu Province, like all fraternal provinces and cities across the country, under the guidance and encouragement of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, comprehensively completed and ahead of schedule overfulfilled the original leap forward targets in industry, agriculture, and other undertakings. The people's communes have been further consolidated and developed soundly. New and significant victories have been achieved in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front. The people's socialist and communist consciousness has been further enhanced, and their material and cultural lives have been further improved. The reason we have been able to achieve these accomplishments is mainly due to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the close support of fraternal provinces and cities, and the united efforts of Party organizations at all levels, the broad masses of cadres and people, and the People's Liberation Army troops participating in the construction throughout the province.
    In the practice of the continuous great leap forward in 1958 and 1959, we deeply feel that developing people's conscious dynamism is an extremely important issue. All our achievements are the result of the broad masses of cadres and people following objective laws and fully developing their conscious dynamism under the glorious light of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete reality of China. In socialist construction, certain material conditions are necessary. Only with certain material conditions, coupled with people's subjective efforts, can we achieve the goals that people can achieve. However, under certain material conditions, whether the work is done quickly, well, and economically, or slowly, poorly, and wastefully, people's conscious dynamism is the decisive factor. There are many such examples: although the conditions in two regions are roughly the same, the results of their work are very different due to the different thoughts and viewpoints of the people and their different enthusiasm; or although the conditions in two regions are very different, as long as people have the same proletarian ambition and soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, they can all achieve more, faster, better, and more economically.
    Here are two examples.
    One is an example of a region with relatively good conditions. The Suzhou Special District in the south of our province, located in the Taihu Lake basin, has always been known as a high-yield agricultural area, but the increase in production was not fast before 1958, and in some years it even declined. The main reason for this situation was that some cadres in this special district at that time believed in a so-called "law that high-yield areas cannot greatly increase production." Since the Great Leap Forward, the comrades in the Suzhou Special District have debated this issue many times, launched a series of struggles against right-leaning conservative thought, shattered the superstition that "high-yield areas cannot greatly increase production," fully mobilized the masses, tried every means to utilize the existing favorable conditions, and actively created new favorable conditions to overcome unfavorable conditions, and fought for a large increase in agricultural production. In this way, they achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in 1958. Their grain output increased by an average of only 3.49% per year during the First Five-Year Plan period, but in 1958 it increased by 33.1% compared to 1957. In 1959, because they basically withstood the right-leaning cold wind that occurred in the summer, and overcame this cold wind in actual action, insisted on implementing the general line, insisted on putting politics in command, insisted on launching mass movements, and insisted on implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production, they continued to achieve a great leap forward, and grain output increased by another 25.3% compared to 1958. Forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries also had great development. The comrades in the Suzhou Special District, because they proceeded from the actual situation in the area and developed their conscious dynamism, achieved continuous two years of great leap forward. In sharp contrast to the Suzhou Special District, a county next to the Suzhou Special District had roughly the same objective conditions as the Suzhou Special District, but its grain output in 1959 was lower than in 1958. Their main lesson is that they failed to withstand the right-leaning cold wind when it struck, and were influenced by the spontaneous forces of rural capitalism represented by some well-to-do middle peasants. They no longer emphasized working hard and striving for the top, and the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production was not effectively implemented. The prominent manifestations were that the varieties of rice were mixed, the agricultural seasons were not tightly grasped, and the planting was sparse, so the harvest was not good. All these show that the comrades in this county did not develop their conscious dynamism enough.
    Let me give another example of a region with relatively poor conditions. The Huaiyin Special District in the north of our province has a Lianshui County, which has always been a poor area. After several years of work since liberation, although their situation has improved a lot, the face has not been fundamentally changed, and it is still often necessary to transfer grain from outside. Since the second half of 1958, Party organizations at all levels in Lianshui County have launched a vigorous socialist education movement, carried out a great airing of views, great contending, and great debate, debating issues such as "Do we want to turn over even if we are poor," "Can we turn over," "How to turn over," and "Who to rely on to turn over." According to them, the result of this debate was to sweep away the disease of "fear of difficulty," to thoroughly break the theory of "fixed situation," to establish lofty ambitions, and to boost revolutionary enthusiasm. In response to the local situation of "two bads" (poor soil quality, poor water conservancy conditions) and "five shortages" (lack of cattle, lack of pigs, lack of fertilizer, lack of agricultural tools, lack of improved varieties), they adopted practical measures, launched mass movements in a big way, combined fundamental solutions with stopgap measures, and developed diversified operations with grain as the key link. The most important thing was that the first secretary of the county party committee personally took command, leading a poor team to turn over and set an example for the whole county. The secretaries of the county party committee were responsible for different areas, and each led a poor team. The members of the standing committee of the county party committee and the secretaries of the commune party committees also led a poor team each, from top to bottom, with one heart and one mind, fighting against poverty. After more than a year of hard work, they have achieved remarkable results. In 1959, not only did they not need to transfer grain from outside, but they could also transfer 10 million catties of grain. Of their original ninety-nine relatively poor production teams, sixty-nine teams have now caught up with or basically caught up with the local rich teams, thirteen teams have caught up with the general teams, and the other seventeen teams have also increased production by 20% to 30% compared to 1958. Not only can eighty-one of these ninety-nine production teams be self-sufficient in grain, but they have also sold 8.17 million catties of surplus grain, and the income of the commune members is already equivalent to the level of the local middle peasants.
    These two examples show that whether in areas with relatively good conditions or areas with relatively poor conditions, the key to achieving sustained leap forward lies in whether people can follow objective laws and fully develop their conscious dynamism.
    Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us that we must fully develop our conscious dynamism. He said: "We oppose subjectively looking at problems, saying that a person's thoughts are not based on and do not conform to objective facts, are fantasies, are false truths, and if they are followed, they will fail, so they must be opposed. But everything must be done by people... To do well, we must first have people draw out ideas, truths, and opinions based on objective facts, and put forward plans, guidelines, policies, strategies, and tactics. Thoughts, etc., are subjective things, and doing or acting is the manifestation of subjective things in objective things, which are the special dynamism of human beings. We call this dynamism 'conscious dynamism,' which is the characteristic that distinguishes people from things. All thoughts based on and conforming to objective facts are correct thoughts, and all doing or actions based on correct thoughts are correct actions. We must promote such thoughts and actions, and we must promote this conscious dynamism."①
    Does our emphasis on developing conscious dynamism violate the basic principle of materialism that "existence determines consciousness"? It does not violate. We are dialectical materialists. Dialectical materialism believes that objective existence determines people's subjective consciousness, and at the same time, it attaches great importance to the active role of people's subjective consciousness on objective existence, and attaches great importance to the great role of the advanced thinking of the masses of the people in the practice of transforming the objective world. Comrade Mao Zedong once made an extremely important exposition of this basic viewpoint of dialectical materialism. He said: "Indeed, productive forces, practice, and economic base generally manifest themselves as the main decisive role. Anyone who does not recognize this is not a materialist. However, relations of production, theory, and superstructure, under certain conditions, in turn manifest themselves as the main decisive role. This must also be admitted. When productive forces cannot develop without changing the relations of production, the change in the relations of production plays the main decisive role. When, as Lenin said, 'Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement,' the creation and promotion of revolutionary theory plays the main decisive role. When something (everything is the same) has to be done, but there is no guideline, method, plan, or policy, determining the guideline, method, plan, or policy is also the main decisive thing. When the superstructure of politics, culture, etc., hinders the development of the economic base, innovation in politics and culture becomes the main decisive thing. Are we violating materialism by saying this? No. Because we admit that in the general course of historical development, material things determine spiritual things, and social existence determines social consciousness; however, at the same time, we also admit and must admit the reaction of spiritual things, the reaction of social consciousness to social existence, and the reaction of the superstructure to the economic base. This is not violating materialism, but precisely avoiding mechanical materialism and adhering to dialectical materialism."②
    Here, Comrade Mao Zedong first affirmed that productive forces, practice, and economic base generally manifest themselves as the main decisive role, and at the same time, he especially emphasized the reaction of relations of production to productive forces, the reaction of theory to practice, and the reaction of the superstructure to the economic base; and pointed out that relations of production, theory, and superstructure, under certain conditions, in turn manifest themselves as the main decisive role. Comrade Mao Zedong has always opposed idealists denying that existence determines consciousness, and also opposed mechanical materialists neglecting people's conscious dynamism. He has always adhered to and constantly applied dialectical materialism, and advocated fully developing the conscious dynamism of the masses of the people. This thought of Comrade Mao Zedong has led the entire Party and the people of the whole country to completely complete our country's democratic revolution, and has achieved the great victories of socialist revolution and construction.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that in the struggle to transform society and transform nature, we must fully estimate the great role of the masses of the people and greatly develop people's conscious dynamism. During the revolutionary war years, he said: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is man, not things."③ This is how it is in war, and it is the same in socialist construction. The socialist system has opened up infinitely broad prospects for developing people's conscious dynamism. The 650 million people who have been liberated economically, politically, and ideologically are high-spirited and full of vigor, and have brought into play endless socialist enthusiasm and creativity. Underestimating this enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of the people will lead to right-leaning conservative tendencies. Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly criticized this right-leaning conservative thought. He said: "Of course, no one can think wildly without basis, and no one can plan their actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, and do not try to do things that are really impossible. But the problem now is that right-leaning conservative thinking is causing trouble in many ways, making work in many ways unable to adapt to the development of objective circumstances. The problem now is that there are many things that could have been done with effort, but many people think they cannot be done. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to constantly criticize those really existing right-leaning conservative thoughts."④ In the early days of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction across the country, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the great call to "break superstitions, liberate thoughts, and promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act," which greatly encouraged the socialist enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of cadres and people. This is of extremely great significance in both theory and practice.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on the relationship between objective and subjective is an extremely important exposition and creative development of the dialectical materialism and historical materialism of Marxism-Leninism. We should take Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions as a guide when considering all work issues.
    II.
    Through the great practice of two consecutive years of great leap forward, we have a relatively deep understanding of the issue of developing conscious dynamism.
    Of course, developing people's conscious dynamism does not conflict with following objective laws. The objective laws of the development of things exist independently outside of people's consciousness and do not shift with people's will; at the same time, people's consciousness can correctly reflect objective laws through effort, and people can master and utilize objective laws to benefit society based on correct understanding. With the establishment of our country's socialist system, with the continuous improvement of our people's political consciousness, and with the continuous development of science and technology and the continuous strengthening of the material foundation, our people's conscious dynamism will play an increasingly great role.
    The objective law of the development of things is the inherent and inevitable connection of things themselves, which cannot be known at a glance. It requires people to observe carefully, to conduct investigation and research, especially through practice and through the transformation of things, in order to recognize the objective law of the development of things more completely and more deeply. Therefore, when we do anything, we must first have a basic understanding of this thing, and then do it. In the process of doing it, we must carefully observe the actual situation and constantly summarize experience, so that our understanding becomes more and more profound and complete. In fact, the objective law of anything can be recognized. Whenever people have reached the predetermined goal through effort, this shows that people's understanding conforms to objective reality. Of course, things are constantly developing, so people's understanding should also develop with the development of things, so that it does not lag behind reality.
    People's ability to recognize objective laws is an important dynamism of people; and people's use of objective laws to benefit society based on correct understanding is an even more important dynamism of people. "The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it."⑤ Understanding the world is only our means, and changing the world is our goal. Through the practice of production and the practice of class struggle, people have obtained scientific knowledge of the objective laws of nature and society, and constantly promote this knowledge. People can better utilize the objective laws of nature to develop production, transform nature, conquer the universe, and better utilize the objective laws of society to transform the old society, establish a new society, and promote social progress and development. Although people cannot change the laws of social development, they can promote or delay social development. In class society, all reactionary forces always try their best to hinder the forward development of society, and all progressive forces always try to promote the forward development of society, which requires solving the problem through class struggle. In the era of socialist revolution and construction, people have the possibility to consciously create their own history, and it is even more necessary to develop conscious dynamism.
    The objective laws of socialist economic construction, like other objective laws, exist independently outside of people's consciousness and do not shift with people's will. Therefore, we must make our thoughts reflect the objective laws of our country's economic construction as correctly as possible, and guide our thoughts to promote our country's socialist economic construction more, faster, better, and more economically.
    Our country's economic construction practice, especially the practice of the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, eloquently proves that:
  Comrade Mao Zedong's guidance on our country's economic construction, the Party's general line for socialist construction, and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies profoundly reflect the objective laws of our country's economic construction development.
    The Party's general line for socialist construction formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee is a correct Marxist-Leninist line, which is a dialectical unity of following objective laws and fully developing people's conscious dynamism. It requires us to strengthen Party leadership, boldly mobilize the masses, fully develop
  conscious dynamism, recognize, master, and utilize the objective laws of socialist construction, and seek high-speed development of our country's economic construction. Facts have proved that the Party's general line fully conforms to the actual situation of our country's socialist construction, and expresses the urgent desire of the people of the whole country to get rid of the "poor and blank" state as soon as possible and build a strong socialist country. Once this general line was put forward, it played a great role in mobilizing, organizing, and transforming, mobilizing all positive factors, promoting various construction undertakings, promoting the people's communization of the countryside, and creating a new situation and new atmosphere of great ideological progress and great leap forward in work across the country.
    Economic laws are objectively existing. Not following objective economic laws, denying objective economic laws, and insisting on doing things that are really impossible is subjectivism, which our Party has always opposed. But at the same time, our Party has also always opposed the erroneous view of idolizing objective laws, opposing objective laws and subjective dynamism, and thinking that following objective laws cannot develop subjective dynamism. The Party constantly educates us to recognize, master, and utilize objective economic laws, to go all out, aim high, and give full play to conscious dynamism on the track of objective laws, so as to accelerate our country's socialist construction. Most of our cadres and working people and working intellectuals do this according to the Party's instructions. Under the glorious light of Mao Zedong Thought, they have the ambition of Marxism-Leninism, have the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, they dare to be the masters of social relations, and they also vow to be the masters of nature. They are brave in practice, brave in creation, learn while doing, and do while learning, so that their understanding of the laws of socialist economic construction continues to deepen, and they fully utilize and constantly create favorable conditions, overcome difficulties, and promote socialist construction at high speed in accordance with objective laws. For example, the two examples of the Suzhou Special District and Lianshui County mentioned earlier are like this. However, some of our cadres have another attitude. They do not really understand objective laws. Their understanding of reality is superficial, one-sided, and fixed; they often underestimate the great active role of our country's people who have been liberated under the leadership of the Party and armed with Mao Zedong Thought; they lack ambition, fear hardship and difficulty, procrastinate, and one-sidedly emphasize that conditions are not good, there are objective difficulties, etc., so they do not try to do things that can be done with effort. In fact, unfavorable conditions can be gradually changed. People fully develop their conscious dynamism, they can overcome unfavorable conditions, give full play to the role of favorable conditions, and turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions and create new favorable conditions to do their work better. There are difficulties in doing anything. The problem is that people must fully develop their conscious dynamism and overcome difficulties. We have always despised difficulties strategically and valued difficulties tactically, just as the workers said: "Difficulties are like springs. It depends on whether you are strong or not. If you are strong, they are weak. If you are weak, they are strong." The potential for developing production is endless. Under certain material and technical conditions, different results will be obtained due to different enthusiasm of people. Moreover, as people's labor experience becomes richer and material and technical conditions are further improved, the potential for increased production will become greater and greater. The problem is that people's thoughts must constantly change with the changes in the actual situation, and people's enthusiasm must always be fully boosted, that is to say, people must constantly and fully develop their conscious dynamism. Actual life shows everywhere that due to the differences in people's constant and full development of conscious dynamism, and thus in the full utilization of the various possibilities contained in objective laws, there are differences in their work between doing more, faster, better, and more economically and doing less, slower, poorer, and more wastefully.
    In order to fully develop people's conscious dynamism and better utilize objective economic laws to accelerate the cause of socialist construction, we must adhere to the principle of putting politics in command. Because socialist economic construction is to be carried out by conscious people. The classes in society have not yet been eliminated, and people of different classes have different positions, viewpoints, thoughts, and habits. To carry out economic construction in accordance with socialist principles, we must carry out political and ideological struggles. Politics is a concentrated expression of economics, and the struggle of "who will defeat whom" between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism during the transition period is first and foremost concentrated in political struggle; the development of political struggle will inevitably have a decisive impact on economic development. Countless facts have illustrated this principle. Only the proletariat's putting politics in command can create and continuously develop a socialist economy; if the bourgeoisie puts politics in command, it will weaken or even eliminate the socialist economy and cause the restoration of capitalism. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Without a correct political viewpoint, it is like having no soul."⑥ Only by adhering to the proletariat's putting politics in command can we truly grasp the economic laws of socialism; only those who have a high degree of communist consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm can recognize and master economic laws and use them to promote socialist construction more, faster, better, and more economically.
    To implement the proletariat's putting politics in command is to put Marxism-Leninism in command, to put the Party's general line in command, and to adhere to the Party's leadership in all work. Practice has proved that only under the leadership of the Party can our country's construction develop at a high speed. This high speed is unprecedented in our country's history and cannot be compared with any capitalist country. Our Party is armed with the science of the objective laws of social development. It can not only victoriously guide the revolutionary struggle and achieve the great victories of our country's two revolutions, but also victoriously guide economic construction like guiding the revolutionary struggle, and achieve the high-speed development of economic construction in the past ten years, especially in the past two years. We also deeply feel in our work that as long as any region or any department adheres to putting politics in command and strengthens the Party's leadership, the socialist righteousness will be promoted, the capitalist evil winds will have nowhere to hide, the cadres and the masses will be united, vigorous, and enthusiastic, and production and other construction undertakings will be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve sustained leap forward.
    Adhering to putting politics in command and caring for the people materially are consistent. We always believe that politics is the first priority and material encouragement is the second priority. We must constantly carry out socialist and communist education among the masses of the people, promote the communist style, and advocate the communist attitude towards labor. At the same time, in the socialist stage, we adhere to the principle of distribution according to work, and with the continuous improvement of the people's socialist and communist consciousness and with the continuous enrichment of social products, we constantly increase the communist factors in distribution. Our policy is to correctly combine the interests of the state, the interests of the collective, and the interests of the individual, the long-term interests and the current interests, and the overall interests and the partial interests to accelerate the promotion of our country's socialist construction. If, as some comrades advocate, we deviate from politics and one-sidedly emphasize individual material incentives, we will inevitably lead people to pursue individual and immediate interests in a meticulous manner and ignore the overall and long-term interests, and implement "money in command." The workers of the Wuxi Internal Combustion Engine Factory had a big-character poster, which clearly explained the difference between "putting politics in command" and "putting money in command":
    Putting politics in command, the flag is red, Putting money in command, the flag is black,
    The red flag is inserted in the mind, Drilled into the eyes of money,
    I am for everyone and everyone is for me, I am for myself and everyone is for me,
    Working is really easy. Walking in front of people is smelly.
    Some people suspect that we emphasize developing people's conscious dynamism in socialist economic construction. Will it disrupt the normal order of economic construction and balanced development? This suspicion is unnecessary.
    The purpose of our Party's general line and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies is to mobilize all positive factors and develop our country's socialist construction at a high speed. High speed and proportionality can be unified. Our country's high-speed development of the national economy is based on agriculture, is in accordance with the principle of giving priority to the development of heavy industry and combining it with the development of agriculture, better handles the relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry, and strengthens other economic sectors in a planned and step-by-step manner, so that all aspects of the national economy develop at a leap forward speed. In this way, the proportional relationship between them can be coordinated in development. Socialist economic plans are originally levers for mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses, not shackles that bind the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses. The state's economic plans rely on the workers in various factories and mines and people's communes to implement and complete them. Boldly mobilizing the masses and letting the workers fully develop their enthusiasm and creativity and try their best to break through labor quotas will only benefit the completion of the state's plans. Some comrades are worried that doing so will "disrupt the normal order of construction and balanced development," which is wrong. Advanced workers, advanced units, and advanced departments have broken through the old balance, which is a good thing. We must never pull back the advanced to maintain the old balance, but should promote the backward to catch up with the advanced and establish a new balance. Isn't this a matter of course? A passive theory of balance can only suppress the socialist enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and hinder the rapid development of socialist undertakings.
    Some people suspect that we emphasize developing people's conscious dynamism in socialist economic construction. Will it ignore the important role of technology? This suspicion is also unnecessary.
    Technology has a very important position in socialist construction. We must arm our industry, agriculture, and transportation with modern technology, which is an indispensable factor for the sustained leap forward of the national economy. However, compared with material factors and human factors, human factors are more important. No matter what kind of modern technological equipment, it must be started by people to work. The same technological equipment, when mastered by people with different thoughts, viewpoints, and enthusiasm, will have different effects. Without people, any technological equipment is a pile of dead things. And after all, all technological equipment is the crystallization of human labor. Without human labor, no technological equipment will be produced. Some comrades have a pessimistic mood, thinking that our country's technology is still relatively backward, so construction can only "come slowly." And we believe that precisely because our technology is now relatively backward, we should develop people's conscious dynamism, implement the Party's general line and the policy of "walking on two legs," from indigenous to foreign, combining indigenous and foreign, from small to large, combining large, medium, and small, continue to adhere to the principle of self-reliance, and carry out technical revolution and cultural revolution in a big way. In this way, we can transform from a relatively backward technical level to a modern advanced technical level in not a very long time.
    III.
    Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, we should continue to strengthen the unity and efforts of Party organizations at all levels, the broad masses of cadres, and the people throughout Jiangsu Province, fully develop conscious dynamism, and ensure the sustained leap forward of socialist construction in our province in 1960 and in the future.
    We must carry out the socialist revolution to the end. The continuous deepening of the socialist revolution and the sustained leap forward of economic construction are conditions for each other and promote each other. The deeper and more thorough the socialist revolution, the greater and better the achievements of the leap forward in economic construction. The continuous leap forward in economic construction will inevitably be resisted by the bourgeoisie and the conservative forces under its influence, requiring continuous revolution on the political and ideological front to clear the way for its advance. If we relax our struggle against them, it will inevitably be reflected in economic construction and affect the sustained leap forward.
    We communists have lofty communist ideals. We are now moving towards this great goal step by step. Every one of our comrades, in the current socialist construction, should have communist ambitions and revolutionary enthusiasm, which is a manifestation of the class nature and Party spirit of the proletariat. Only the proletariat, because it represents the direction of historical progress, is always full of confidence in victory and revolutionary optimism, has indomitable revolutionary firmness, and always maintains a strong fighting will and soaring revolutionary enthusiasm. No difficulties can weaken the proletariat's ambition to transform society and transform nature, and no force can hinder the proletariat from realizing its historical mission. Therefore, lacking lofty aspirations and insufficient enthusiasm is a manifestation of the weak class nature and Party spirit of the proletariat. We must help some comrades who have not completely overcome individualism, decentralism, departmentalism, the erroneous viewpoints of emphasizing business and neglecting politics, and whose revolutionary will is not strong enough, to break down the idealist and mechanical materialist world outlook in a big way, and establish the dialectical materialist and historical materialist world outlook in a big way; break down the world outlook of the lazy and the coward in a big way, and establish the ambition and revolutionary enthusiasm of Marxism-Leninism in a big way. Only in this way can we have a correct understanding of all issues, and under the guidance of correct understanding, we can boost revolutionary enthusiasm and develop creative spirit.
    Recently, the comrades of the Yancheng Prefectural Party Committee in our province made a resolution to "Establish lofty ambitions, have great aspirations, jump out of Yancheng and catch up with Jiangnan," and are launching a discussion among the Party and the broad masses of the people. They specifically analyzed the conditions of Yancheng Prefecture, and compared them with the conditions of Suzhou Prefecture. They believe that it is possible to approach and catch up with Suzhou Prefecture within three years. The comrades in Xuzhou and Huaiyin prefectures are also determined to work hard in 1960, boost their energy and catch up with Jiangnan, and further change their backward appearance. The comrades in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou prefectures are determined to work hard and compete with Suzhou Prefecture. The comrades in Suzhou Prefecture are determined to guard against arrogance and rashness and go to a higher level. All other regions are also determined to strive for the top and catch up. Their revolutionary ambition is valuable. People have established revolutionary ambitions, their mental state will change, and they can come up with enthusiasm, come up with methods, improve their confidence and perseverance in overcoming difficulties, and maximize people's intelligence and wisdom and the great power of courage, indomitability, and invincibility.
    We must continue to carry out socialist education movements among the working people, continuously improve their socialist and communist consciousness, and further eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology. We must also continue to correctly handle contradictions among the people, constantly adjust relations among the people, especially the relations between leaders and those who are led, and between cadres and the masses, and constantly overcome the bureaucratic and commandist style existing in some cadres. Adhere to the system of cadres participating in physical labor and thoroughly eliminate official airs. At the same time, we must also take good care of the people's lives and continue to rapidly arrange the people's lives better in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. The more the Party cares about the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses.
    We must continue to launch mass movements in a big way. The facts of two consecutive years of great leap forward have proved that launching mass movements in a big way is not only applicable to the industrial and agricultural sectors, but also applicable to all economic sectors and all work sectors. Only on the basis of the combination of the soaring enthusiasm of the masses of the people and the constantly innovating material and technical conditions can the continuous high-speed leap forward of our country's national economy be guaranteed. Carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution in a big way and improving labor productivity is one of the main contents of the mass movement. Carrying out mass tool reform movements and promoting advanced production technology and experience, and improving the level of technical operation on the basis of existing equipment according to the current material and technical conditions, is the most effective way to improve labor productivity. In the final analysis, the rapid development of all construction undertakings, without the initiative and creativity of the masses of the people, without mass movements under the leadership of the Party, nothing can be done successfully.
    To launch mass movements in a big way and promote the revolutionary heroism of the masses, we must adopt appropriate working methods and forms of activity, carry out competitions and appraisals, promote the backward to catch up with the advanced, and the advanced to become more advanced, so that the socialist hot winds in every place will overwhelm the capitalist cold winds. Just as the peasant brothers said: "The red flag must be flying, the gongs and drums must be played, the ring must be fought, and the competition must be carried out." These forms are needed by the masses. They like it lively and do not like it cold and quiet. The great achievements of industrial and agricultural production and other construction undertakings in the past two years have in fact been achieved through launching mass movements in a big way and giving full play to the initiative and creativity of the masses of the people.
    We must organize cadres at all levels to seriously, comprehensively, and systematically study Mao Zedong Thought, and publicize Mao Zedong Thought to the broad masses of the people. Comrade Mao Zedong creatively combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution to solve various problems in the Chinese revolution and construction, so that Marxism-Leninism has achieved a great victory in our large country with a population of 650 million, thereby enriching and developing Marxism-Leninism in many aspects. We deeply realize that as long as our country's revolution and construction follow Mao Zedong Thought at all times, we will be invincible; if we deviate from Mao Zedong Thought even slightly, we will definitely suffer setbacks and even cause losses in our work for a period of time. Today, our construction undertakings are developing rapidly, and many new problems are placed before us, requiring us to be able to solve them correctly and in a timely manner. Therefore, studying Mao Zedong Thought is even more important. The Party committees of our province, prefecture, city, county, commune, factory, mine, enterprise, and school must quickly launch a movement to study Mao Zedong Thought and persist in it to constantly improve our ideological level. Only if our ideological level is constantly improved can our cause continue to be victorious.
    We must earnestly study Comrade Mao Zedong's great communist style, always pay attention to identifying the direction, inserting the red flag, and enhancing the fighting power of Party organizations at all levels. In the future, the provincial party committee and the party committees of various prefectures, cities, counties, communes, factories, mines, enterprises, and schools in our province must strengthen ideological leadership and organizational leadership, especially within the core of the party committee's leadership, we must adhere to principles and often carry out criticism and self-criticism. We should always fight to strengthen the unity of Party organizations at all levels on the basis of Marxist-Leninist ideological and organizational principles. The core of the Party's leadership must be loyal to the Party, closely connected with the masses, and have combat effectiveness. Only in this way can we ensure the smooth implementation of the Party's line, principles, and policies, ensure the continuous high tide of the people's enthusiasm and creativity, and withstand the test of storms.

    学习毛泽东思想充分发扬自觉的能动性

    一
    我国人民已经胜利地跨进了一个新的年代，正在满怀信心地为实现1960年的继续跃进，为尽快地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的强大的社会主义国家而奋斗。回顾1959年，江苏省同全国各兄弟省市一样，在党的社会主义建设总路线的指引和鼓舞下，在1958年大跃进的基础上，工业、农业和其他各项事业，都全面地完成和提前、超额完成了原定的跃进指标。人民公社得到了进一步的巩固和健全发展。政治思想战线上的社会主义革命取得了新的重大胜利。人民的社会主义、共产主义觉悟程度更加提高，物质生活和文化生活有了进一步的改善。我们所以能够取得这些成就，主要是由于以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的正确领导，各兄弟省市的亲密支援，全省各级党组织、广大干部和人民群众以及参加建设的人民解放军部队的团结努力。
    在1958年和1959年连续两年大跃进的实践中，我们深切地感到，发扬人的自觉的能动性是一个极为重要的问题。我们的一切成就，是广大干部和人民群众在马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国实际相结合的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，遵从客观规律，充分发扬了人们的自觉能动性的结果。在社会主义建设中，一定的物质条件是必需的，只有具备了一定的物质条件，加上人们的主观努力，才能达到人们所能达到的目的。但是，在一定的物质条件下，工作搞得多快好省，还是搞得少慢差费，人的自觉的能动性是决定因素。有许多这样的例子：两个地区虽然条件大体相同，但由于人们的思想、观点不同，干劲不同，他们工作的结果也就有很大的不同；或者两个地区的条件虽然有很大不同，但只要人们有同样的无产阶级雄心壮志和冲天的革命干劲，那就都能做到多快好省。
    这里举两个例子。
    一个是条件比较好的地区的例子。我省南部的苏州专区，地处太湖流域，素称农业高产地区，但在1958年以前增产一直不快，有个别年份甚至还减产。发生这种情况的主要原因，就是当时在这个专区的一部分干部中，迷信一种所谓“高产地区不能大增产”的“规律”。大跃进以来，苏州专区的同志多次辩论了这个问题，开展了一系列反对右倾保守思想的斗争，破除了“高产地区不能大增产”的迷信，充分发动了群众，千方百计地利用已有的有利条件，并且积极创造新的有利条件，克服不利条件，为农业大增产而斗争。这样，他们在1958年就实现了空前的大跃进。他们的粮食产量，在第一个五年计划期间，平均每年只递增3．49％，1958年就比1957年增长了33．1％。1959年，由于他们基本上顶住了夏季一度发生的右倾冷风，在实际行动中克服了这股冷风，坚持贯彻执行总路线，坚持政治挂帅，坚持大搞群众运动，坚持贯彻执行农业生产的“八字宪法”，因而继续实现了大跃进，粮食产量又比1958年增长25．3％，林、牧、副、渔业也有很大的发展。苏州专区的同志由于从当地的实际情况出发，发扬了自觉的能动性，因而实现了连续两年的大跃进。同苏州专区适成鲜明对照的，是在苏州专区旁边的一个县，客观条件和苏州专区差不多，但1959年的粮食产量反而比1958年低了。他们的主要教训是，在右倾冷风袭击的时候没有能够顶住，受了以一部分富裕中农为代表的农村资本主义自发势力的影响，不再那么强调鼓足干劲、力争上游了，农业生产的“八字宪法”也贯彻不力了，突出的表现是水稻的品种杂、农业季节抓得不紧、种得又稀了，因而收成不好。这些，都说明了这个县的同志的自觉的能动性发扬得不够。
    再举一个条件比较差的地区的例子。我省北部淮阴专区，有一个涟水县，历来是一个贫瘠地区。经过解放以后几年的工作，他们的情况虽有很多改善，但面貌还没有基本改变，还常常需要从外边调进粮食。从1958年下半年起，涟水县各级党组织开展了一个轰轰烈烈的社会主义教育运动，进行了大鸣大放大辩论，辩论了“我们穷要不要翻身”、“能不能翻身”、“怎样翻身”、“翻身依靠谁”等问题。这次辩论的结果，按照他们的说法，是横扫了“畏难”病，大破了“定局”论，树立了雄心壮志，鼓足了革命干劲。他们针对当地“两不好”（土质不好，水利条件不好）、“五缺”（缺牛、缺猪、缺肥料、缺农具、缺良种）的情况，采取切实措施，大搞群众运动，治本与治标相结合，以粮食为纲，开展多种经营。最重要的是县委第一书记亲自挂帅，领导一个穷队翻身，为全县作出榜样。县委各书记分片负责，也各自领导一个穷队。县委常委、公社党委书记也都各自领导一个穷队，从上到下，一心一德，和贫穷作斗争。经过一年多的艰苦努力，他们取得了显著的成绩，1959年不但不要从外面调进粮食，还可以调出粮食一千万斤。他们原有九十九个比较穷的生产队，现在已有六十九个队赶上或基本赶上了当地的富队，有十三个队已赶上了一般队，其他十七个队也比1958年增产了20％到30％。这九十九个生产队中不但有八十一个队粮食可以自给，而且还卖出了余粮八百一十七万斤，社员的收入已经相当于当地一般中农水平。
    这两个例子说明：不管条件比较好的地方或者条件比较差的地方，要实现持续跃进，关键就在于人们能不能遵从客观规律，充分发扬自觉的能动性。
    毛泽东同志经常教导我们，必须充分发扬自觉的能动性，他说：“我们反对主观地看问题，说的是一个人的思想，不根据和不符合于客观事实，是空想，是假道理，如果照了做去，就要失败，故须反对它。但是一切事情是要人做的……。做就必须先有人根据客观事实，引出思想、道理、意见，提出计划、方针、政策、战略、战术，方能做得好。思想等等是主观的东西，做或行动是主观见之于客观的东西，都是人类特殊的能动性。这种能动性，我们名之曰‘自觉的能动性’，是人之所以区别于物的特点。一切根据和符合于客观事实的思想是正确的思想，一切根据于正确思想的做或行动是正确的行动。我们必须发扬这样的思想和行动，必须发扬这种自觉的能动性。”①
    我们强调发扬自觉的能动性，是否违反“存在决定意识”这条唯物主义的基本原理呢？并不违反。我们是辩证唯物主义者。辩证唯物主义认为，客观存在决定人们的主观意识，同时又极其重视人们的主观意识对于客观存在的能动作用，极其重视人民群众的先进思想在改造客观世界的实践中的伟大作用。毛泽东同志曾经对辩证唯物主义的这个基本观点做了极其重要的发挥。他说：“诚然，生产力、实践、经济基础，一般地表现为主要的决定的作用，谁不承认这一点，谁就不是唯物论者。然而，生产关系、理论、上层建筑这些方面，在一定条件之下，又转过来表现其为主要的决定的作用。这也是必须承认的。当着不变更生产关系，生产力就不能发展的时候，生产关系的变更就起了主要的决定的作用。当着如同列宁所说‘没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动’的时候，革命理论的创立和提倡就起了主要的决定的作用。当着某一件事情（任何事情都是一样）要做，但是还没有方针、方法、计划或政策的时候，确定方针、方法、计划或政策，也就是主要的决定的东西。当着政治文化等等上层建筑阻碍着经济基础的发展的时候，对于政治上和文化上的革新就成为主要的决定的东西了。我们这样说，是否违反了唯物论呢？没有。因为我们承认总的历史发展中是物质的东西决定精神的东西，是社会的存在决定社会的意识；但是同时又承认而且必须承认精神的东西的反作用，社会意识对于社会存在的反作用，上层建筑对于经济基础的反作用。这不是违反唯物论，正是避免了机械唯物论，坚持了辩证唯物论。”②
    在这里，毛泽东同志首先肯定了生产力、实践、经济基础，一般地表现为主要的决定的作用，同时又特别强调了生产关系对生产力、理论对实践、上层建筑对经济基础的反作用；并且指出，生产关系、理论、上层建筑，在一定条件之下，又转过来表现其为主要的决定的作用。毛泽东同志从来就是既反对唯心主义者否认存在决定意识，又反对机械唯物主义者忽视人的自觉的能动性的，他始终坚持并时时刻刻运用辩证唯物主义，主张充分发扬人民群众的自觉的能动性。毛泽东同志的这种思想，领导全党和全国人民彻底完成了我国的民主革命，并且取得了社会主义革命和建设的伟大胜利。
    毛泽东同志教导我们，在改造社会、改造自然的斗争中，必须充分估计到人民群众的伟大作用，大大发扬人们自觉的能动性。在过去革命战争时期，他说：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”③进行战争是这样，进行社会主义建设同样是这样。社会主义制度，为发扬人们自觉的能动性开辟了无限广阔的前途。在经济上、政治上、思想上得到了解放的六亿五千万人民，意气风发，龙腾虎跃，发挥出了无穷无尽的社会主义积极性和创造性。对人民群众的这种积极性和创造性估计不足，就会产生右倾保守的倾向。毛泽东同志曾经一再批判过这种右倾保守思想，他说：“当然，任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。但是现在的问题，还是右倾保守思想在许多方面作怪，使许多方面的工作不能适应客观情况的发展。现在的问题是经过努力本来可以做到的事情，却有很多人认为做不到。因此，不断地批判那些确实存在的右倾保守思想，就有完全的必要了。”④在全国社会主义建设大跃进初期，毛泽东同志又提出“破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格”的伟大号召，这个号召大大鼓舞了广大干部和人民群众的社会主义的积极性和创造性。这在理论方面和实践方面都具有极其重大的意义。
    毛泽东同志关于客观和主观的关系的学说，是对于马克思列宁主义的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的极其重要的发挥和创造性的发展。我们在考虑一切工作问题的时候，应当以毛泽东同志的指示作为指南。
    二
    经过两年连续大跃进的伟大实践，我们对于发扬自觉的能动性的问题，有了比较深切的体会。
    发扬人的自觉的能动性当然并不是和遵从客观规律相冲突的。事物发展的客观规律，是独立存在于人们的意识之外，不以人们的意志为转移的；同时，人们的意识，能够经过努力而正确反映客观规律，并且人们能够根据正确的认识而掌握客观规律，利用客观规律来为社会谋福利。随着我国社会主义制度的建立，随着我国人民政治觉悟的不断提高，随着科学技术的不断发展和物质基础的不断加强，我国人民群众的自觉的能动性将发挥出愈来愈伟大的作用。
      事物发展的客观规律是事物本身内在的必然的联系，不可能一望而知。它要求人们用心地去观察，去进行调查研究，特别是通过实践、通过对于事物的变革，才能比较完备地比较深刻地认识事物发展的客观规律。因此，我们做任何事情，首先要对于这件事有一个基本的了解，然后就干起来，在干的过程中再细心体察实际情况，经常总结经验，使我们的认识一次比一次更深刻、更完备。事实上，任何事物的客观规律都是可以认识的，凡是人们经过努力达到了预定的目的，这就说明人们的认识是符合客观实际的。当然，事物是不断发展的，因此，人们的认识也应该随着事物的发展而不断发展，使之不落后于实际。
      人们能够认识客观规律，是人们的一种重要的能动性；而人们依据正确的认识，利用客观规律来为社会谋福利，是人们的一种更为重要的能动性。“哲学家们只是用不同的方式说明过世界，而问题却在于要改变世界。”⑤认识世界只是我们的手段，改变世界才是我们的目的。通过生产的实践和阶级斗争的实践，人们取得了对于自然界和社会的客观规律的科学认识，并且不断地推进这种认识，人们就能够更好地利用自然界的客观规律来发展生产，改造自然，征服宇宙，并且更好地利用社会的客观规律来改造旧社会，建立新社会，促进社会的进步和发展。人们虽然不能改变社会发展的规律，但是可以促进或延缓社会的发展。在阶级社会里，一切反动力量总是要竭力阻碍社会向前发展，一切进步力量总是要努力推动社会向前发展，这就要通过阶级斗争来解决问题。在社会主义革命和建设的时代，人们就有可能完全自觉地来创造自己的历史，就更加需要发扬自觉的能动性了。
      社会主义经济建设的客观规律，和其他客观规律一样，也是独立存在于人们的意识之外，不以人们的意志为转移的。因此，我们必须使我们的思想能够尽可能正确地反映我国经济建设的客观规律，并且以这种认识为指导，多快好省地推进我国的社会主义经济建设。
      我国经济建设的实践，特别是两年来大跃进的实践，雄辩地证明了：
  毛泽东同志对于我国经济建设的指导、党的社会主义建设的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，是深刻地反映了我国经济建设发展的客观规律的。
    毛泽东同志和党中央制定的党的社会主义建设的总路线，是一条马克思列宁主义的正确路线，是遵从客观规律和充分发扬人们自觉的能动性的辩证统一。它要求我们，加强党的领导，放手发动群众，充分发扬
  自觉的能动性，认识、掌握和利用社会主义建设的客观规律，求得我国经济建设的高速度发展。事实证明：党的总路线完全符合我国社会主义建设的实际情况，又表达了全国人民要求尽快地摆脱“一穷二白”状态、建成一个强大的社会主义国家的迫切愿望。这条总路线一经提出，就发挥出伟大的动员、组织和改造的作用，调动了一切积极因素，推进了各项建设事业，促成了农村的人民公社化，造成了全国思想大进步、工作大跃进的新形势、新气象。
    经济规律是客观存在的。不遵从客观经济规律，否认客观经济规律，硬要做实在做不到的事情，那是主观主义，是我们党所一直反对的。但在同时，我们党也一直反对那种把客观规律偶像化，把客观规律和主观能动性对立起来，以为遵从客观规律就不能发扬主观能动作用的错误观点。党不断教育我们，要去认识、掌握和利用客观经济规律，鼓足干劲，力争上游，在客观规律的轨道上充分发挥自觉的能动性，以加速我国的社会主义建设。我们大多数干部和劳动群众、劳动知识分子，是按照党的指示这样做的。他们在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，有马克思列宁主义的雄心壮志，有敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，他们敢于做社会关系的主人，也立誓要做大自然的主人。他们勇于实践，勇于创造，在干中学，在学中干，使自己对于社会主义经济建设的规律的认识不断深化，并且充分利用和不断创造有利条件，克服困难，按照客观规律来高速度地推进社会主义建设事业。例如，前面说到的苏州专区和涟水县的两个例子就是这样。但是，在我们一部分干部中，却有另外一种态度。他们并不真正了解客观规律，他们对实际的认识，是表面的、片面的、固定不变的；他们对于在党领导下的、解放了的、用毛泽东思想武装了的我国人民的伟大的能动作用，常常估计不足；他们缺乏雄心壮志，怕苦畏难，拖拖沓沓，片面强调什么条件不好呀，客观上有困难呀，等等，因而对于经过努力可以办到的事也不努力去办。事实上，条件不好是可以逐步改变的，人们充分发扬自觉的能动性，就可以克服不利条件，充分发挥有利条件的作用，并且变不利条件为有利条件，创造新的有利条件，把工作做得更好。做任何事情都是有困难的，问题是要人们充分发扬自觉的能动性，克服困难。我们从来就是在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难的，正像工人同志所说的：“困难像弹簧，看你强不强，你强它就弱，你弱它就强。”发展生产的潜力是无穷无尽的。在一定的物质技术条件下，由于人们的干劲不同，会得出不同的结果。而且，随着人们的劳动经验更加丰富，物质技术条件的更加改善，增产潜力也就会愈来愈大。问题是人们的思想要随着实际情况的变化而不断变化，人们的干劲要经常鼓得足足的，也就是说，人们要经常地充分地发扬自觉的能动性。实际生活处处这样表明：由于人们在经常地充分地发扬自觉的能动性方面，从而在充分利用客观规律所包含着的各种可能性方面，存在着差别，因此，他们的工作也就有多快好省和少慢差费的差别。
    为了充分发扬人们的自觉的能动性，更好地利用客观经济规律来加速社会主义建设事业，我们必须坚持政治挂帅的原则。因为社会主义的经济建设是要有意识的人来进行的。现在社会上的阶级还没有消灭，不同阶级的人有不同的立场、观点、思想、习惯。要按照社会主义的原则来进行经济建设，就必然要进行政治思想的斗争。政治是经济的集中表现，过渡时期无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义和资本主义“谁战胜谁”的斗争，首先就集中表现为政治斗争；政治斗争的发展，必然给予经济的发展以决定性的影响。无数的事实都说明了这个道理，只有无产阶级的政治挂帅，才能创立和不断发展社会主义的经济；如果资产阶级的政治挂帅，那就会削弱乃至取消社会主义的经济，造成资本主义的复辟。毛泽东同志说：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”⑥只有坚持无产阶级的政治挂帅，才能真正掌握社会主义的经济规律；只有具有高度的共产主义觉悟和革命干劲的人，才能认识和掌握经济规律，利用它来多快好省地推进社会主义建设。
    实行无产阶级的政治挂帅，也就是马克思列宁主义挂帅，党的总路线挂帅，在一切工作中坚持党的领导。实践证明：只有在党的领导下，才有我国建设高速度的发展，这种高速度是我国历史上从来没有过的，是任何资本主义国家所无法比拟的。我们党是以社会发展的客观规律的科学武装起来的，他不仅能够胜利地指导革命斗争，取得了我国两个革命的伟大胜利，而且能够像指导革命斗争一样，胜利地指导经济建设，取得了十年来，特别是近两年来经济建设高速度的发展。我们在工作中也深切地感到，任何地区，任何部门，只要坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导，社会主义的正气就得以伸张，资本主义的歪风就无处肆虐，干部、群众就团结一致，朝气勃勃，干劲冲天，生产和其他各种建设事业也就能够克服一切困难，取得持续跃进。
    坚持政治挂帅和从物质利益上关心人民群众是一致的。我们始终认为，政治是第一位，物质鼓励是第二位。我们必须经常不断地在人民群众中进行社会主义、共产主义的教育，发扬共产主义风格，提倡共产主义的劳动态度。同时，我们在社会主义阶段的分配制度上坚持以按劳分配为主的原则，并且随着人民群众社会主义、共产主义觉悟的不断提高，随着社会产品的不断丰富，不断增长分配方面的共产主义因素。我们的方针是，使国家利益、集体利益和个人利益，长远利益和目前利益，整体利益和局部利益正确地结合起来，加速推进我国的社会主义建设。如果像有些同志所主张的那样，脱离政治，片面地强调个人的物质刺激，就必然会引导人们去斤斤计较地追求个人的、眼前的利益，而忽视整体的、长远的利益，实行“钞票挂帅”。无锡市内燃机厂的工人同志有一张大字报，鲜明地说明了“政治挂帅”和“钞票挂帅”的区别：
    政治挂帅帅旗红，钞票挂帅帅旗黑，
    红旗插在脑海中，一头钻在钱眼中，
    我为人人人为我，我为自己人为我，
    干起活来真轻松。走在人前臭哄哄。
    有人怀疑，我们在社会主义经济建设中，强调发扬人的自觉的能动性。是否会破坏经济建设的正常秩序和平衡发展。这种怀疑是不必要的。
    我们党的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，其目的是为了调动一切积极因素，高速度地发展我国的社会主义建设事业。高速度和按比例是能够统一的。我国国民经济的高速度发展是以农业为基础，是按照优先发展重工业和发展农业相结合的原则，更好地处理农业、轻工业和重工业各部门之间的关系，并且有计划、有步骤地加强其他各个经济部门，使国民经济各方面都以跃进的速度向前发展，这样，它们相互之间的比例关系是能够在发展中求得协调的。社会主义的经济计划本来就是调动劳动群众积极性和创造性的杠杆，而不是束缚劳动群众积极性和创造性的桎梏。国家的经济计划，要依靠各个厂矿和人民公社的劳动者去执行、去完成。放手发动群众，让劳动者充分发挥积极性和创造性，尽量突破劳动定额，只会对完成国家计划有利。有些同志却担心这样做会“打乱建设的正常秩序和平衡发展”，这是不对的。先进工作者、先进单位和先进部门突破了旧的平衡，这是好事情，我们决不能硬拉住先进的开倒车来保持旧的平衡，而应当推动落后的赶上先进的，建立新的平衡，难道这不是理所当然的事情么？消极的平衡论，只能压制群众的社会主义的积极性和创造性，阻碍社会主义事业的迅速发展。
    有人怀疑，我们在社会主义经济建设中，强调发扬人的自觉的能动性，是否会忽视技术的重要作用，这种怀疑也是不必要的。
    技术在社会主义建设中具有非常重要的地位。我们必须用现代化的技术把我们的工业、农业、交通运输事业武装起来，这是国民经济持续跃进的一个不可缺少的因素。但是，物的因素和人的因素比较起来，更为重要的是人的因素。不管怎么样的现代化技术装备，都要人去开动，才能工作。同样的技术装备，由思想、观点、干劲不同的人去掌握，就会有不同的效果。没有人，任何技术装备都是一堆死东西。而且归根到底，一切技术装备，都是人的劳动的结晶，没有人的劳动，任何技术装备都不会产生。有些同志有一种悲观情绪，认为目前我国的技术还比较落后，因此，建设只能“慢慢来”。而我们认为：正因为我们现在技术比较落后，我们更应该发扬人的自觉的能动作用，贯彻执行党的总路线和“两条腿走路”的方针，从土到洋，土洋并举，从小到大，大、中、小并举，继续坚持自力更生的原则，大搞技术革命和文化革命。这样，我们就可以在不要很长的时间内，从比较落后的技术水平转到现代化的先进的技术水平上去。三
    我们在党中央、毛泽东同志的领导下，应当继续加强江苏省各级党组织、广大干部和人民群众的团结努力，充分发扬自觉的能动性，保证1960年和今后我省社会主义建设事业的持续跃进。
    我们要把社会主义革命进行到底。社会主义革命的不断深入和经济建设的持续跃进是互为条件、互相促进的。社会主义革命愈深愈透，经济建设的跃进成就也愈大愈好。经济建设上的持续跃进，必然会遭到资产阶级以及在它影响下的保守力量的抵抗，要求政治思想战线上的不断革命为它扫清前进的道路。如果我们放松对于它们的斗争，也必然会在经济建设上反映出来，影响到持续跃进。
    我们共产党人，具有远大的共产主义理想。我们现在正一步一步地向着这个伟大的目标前进。我们每个同志，在当前的社会主义建设中，应当有共产主义的雄心壮志和革命干劲，这是无产阶级的阶级性、党性的表现。只有无产阶级，因为它代表着历史前进的方向，所以在任何时候都充满着胜利的信心和革命的乐观主义，具有百折不挠的革命坚定性，永远保持着旺盛的斗争意志和冲天的革命干劲。没有任何困难能够削弱无产阶级改造社会、改造自然的雄心壮志，没有任何力量能够阻挠无产阶级实现自己的历史使命。所以，没有远大志向、干劲不足，是无产阶级的阶级性、党性不强的表现。我们要帮助一些没有彻底克服个人主义、分散主义、本位主义、重业务轻政治等错误观点和革命意志不够坚强的同志，大破唯心主义和机械唯物主义的世界观，大立辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观；大破懒汉和懦夫的世界观，大立马克思列宁主义的雄心壮志和革命干劲。只有这样，我们才能对一切问题有正确的认识，并且在正确的认识的指导下鼓足革命干劲，发挥创造精神。
    最近我省盐城地委的同志作出了“树雄心、立大志，跳出盐城赶江南”的决议，正在党内和广大人民群众中展开讨论，他们具体分析了盐城专区的条件，并且和苏州专区的条件进行了对比，他们认为在三年之内，接近和赶上苏州专区是有可能的。徐州、淮阴专区的同志，也决心在1960年大干一年，鼓足干劲赶江南，进一步改变落后面貌。镇江、扬州专区的同志决心发奋图强，要和苏州专区比高低。苏州专区的同志决心戒骄戒躁，更上一层楼。其他各个地区也都决心力争上游，迎头赶上。他们的这种革命的雄心壮志是可贵的。人们树立了革命的雄心壮志，精神状态就为之一变，就可以出干劲，出办法，提高克服困难的信心和毅力，最大限度地发挥人们的聪明才智和勇往直前、所向披靡的巨大力量。
    我们要在劳动人民中继续进行社会主义教育运动，不断提高他们的社会主义、共产主义觉悟，进一步扫除资产阶级思想的影响。我们还必须继续正确处理人民内部的矛盾，不断调整人民内部的关系，特别是领导者和被领导者、干部和群众的关系，不断克服一部分干部中存在着的官僚主义、命令主义作风。坚持干部参加体力劳动的制度，彻底打掉官气。同时，还要很好地关心人民群众的生活，继续按照增产节约的精神，迅速地把人民群众的生活安排得更好。党越是关心群众的生活，群众的干劲就越大。
    我们要继续大搞群众运动。两年连续大跃进的事实证明：大搞群众运动不仅适用于工农业部门，而且适用于一切经济部门和一切工作部门。只有在人民群众的冲天干劲和不断革新的物质技术条件相结合的基础上，才能保证我国国民经济持续的高速度的跃进。大搞技术革新和技术革命，提高劳动生产率，是群众运动的主要内容之一，而开展群众性的工具改革运动，推广先进的生产技术经验，根据当前的物质技术条件，在现有设备基础上提高技术操作水平，是最有效地提高劳动生产率的办法。归根到底，一切建设事业的迅速发展，离开了人民群众的积极性和创造性，离开了在党的领导下的群众运动，是什么事情也做不成功的。
      大搞群众运动，发扬群众的革命英雄主义精神，要采取适当的工作方法和活动形式，开展竞赛、评比，推动落后的赶先进，先进的更先进，搞得轰轰烈烈，热热闹闹，使每个地方的社会主义的热风都压倒资本主义的冷风。正像农民兄弟们说的：“红旗要飘，锣鼓要敲，擂台要打，竞赛要搞。”这些形式，是群众所需要的，他们喜欢热热闹闹，不喜欢冷冷清清。两年来工农业生产和其他各项建设的伟大成就，事实上都是通过大搞群众运动、充分发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性而取得的。
    我们要组织各级干部认真地、全面地、系统地学习毛泽东思想，向广大人民宣传毛泽东思想。毛泽东同志创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合，来解决中国革命和建设中的各种问题，使得马克思列宁主义在我们这样一个六亿五千万人口的大国中得到了伟大的胜利，从而在许多方面丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义。我们深切地体会到，我国的革命和建设，只要时刻遵循毛泽东思想，就无往而不胜；如果稍一离开毛泽东思想，那就一定会遭到挫折，甚至造成一个时期工作中的损失，今天我们的建设事业正在一日千里地发展，许多新的问题摆在我们面前，要求我们能够及时地正确地去解决，因此，学习毛泽东思想，就显得更为重要了。我们省委、地委、市委、县委以及公社、厂矿企业和学校的党委，必须迅速掀起一个学习毛泽东思想的运动，并且坚持下去，不断提高我们的思想水平。只有我们的思想水平不断提高，我们的事业才能不断胜利。
    我们要认真学习毛泽东同志的伟大的共产主义风格，经常注意辨风向，插红旗，增强党的各级组织的战斗力。今后我省省委和各地委、市委、县委以及公社、厂矿企业和学校的党委都要加强思想领导和组织领导，特别是党委的领导核心内部，必须坚持原则，经常开展批评和自我批评。我们应当经常为增强党的各级组织在马克思列宁主义的思想原则和组织原则基础上的团结而斗争。党的领导核心必须是对党忠诚、同群众密切联系、有战斗力的。只有这样，才能保证党的路线、方针、政策的顺利贯彻执行，才能保证人民群众的积极性和创造精神的不断高涨，才能经得起风浪的考验。
    我们相信：江苏省党的各级组织、广大干部和全省人民群众，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在党中央的英明领导下，必将和全国人民在一起，更加团结一致，充分地发扬自觉的能动性，高举党的总路线的红旗前进，在1958年、1959年大跃进的基础上，继续实现1960年更好更全面的跃进。
