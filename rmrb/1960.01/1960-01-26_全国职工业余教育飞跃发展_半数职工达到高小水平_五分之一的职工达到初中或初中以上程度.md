Xinhua News Agency, 25th dispatch. Concurrently with the continuous great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production over the past two years, a new situation of sustained great leap forward has also emerged in national workers' spare-time education. At present, a cultural revolution upsurge, where everyone establishes lofty ambitions, fosters great aspirations, and universally persists in spare-time study to scale the peaks of culture and science, is taking shape among the broad masses of workers in industrial and mining enterprises throughout the country.

    Currently, whether it is in industrial and mining enterprises in large and medium-sized cities, remote forest areas, and mines, or from modern factories with centralized learning conditions to decentralized and mobile construction sites and railway lines, workers are persisting in spare-time learning. According to statistics, approximately more than half of the total number of workers across the country are participating in various levels and types of spare-time schools, an increase of more than 50% compared to 1958. Among them, there are 170,000 workers studying in spare-time universities and correspondence universities, more than 4.7 million workers studying in spare-time secondary schools (including junior technical and secondary technical schools), and approximately 7 million studying at the senior elementary level. In areas with relatively rapid development of workers' spare-time education, such as Heilongjiang Province, Shanghai, Lushun-Dalian, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Xi'an, many factories and mining enterprises have 80% of their workers participating in regular spare-time learning. Since the beginning of this year, factories and mining enterprises in various places have ensured a "red start" in production while also ensuring a "red start" in worker education. In Shanghai, the vast majority of students in workers' spare-time schools have persisted in their studies, with an attendance rate of over 80%. A group of older workers who did not participate in learning in the past at the Dalian Shipyard have also actively enrolled this year.

    After two consecutive years of great leap forward in 1958-1959, national workers' spare-time education has moved from a situation of alternating high tides to a new stage of great development and great improvement. Many regions have achieved regularization and persistence. Some major cities, industrial and mining areas, and large enterprises have established spare-time schools of various levels and types from primary school to university, as well as short-term training courses, part-work, part-study schools, and full-time advanced study classes to train management cadres and technical personnel. The forms of schooling are also flexible and diverse. Large and medium-sized enterprises mostly adopt two-level schooling at the factory and workshop levels; small enterprises have various forms such as self-run, industry-run, jointly run by nearby factories, and run by the region. In September last year, the national state-owned coal mine system established more than 2,450 spare-time cultural schools, spare-time secondary specialized schools, and spare-time universities. Because education is closely integrated with production, Kailuan Zhaojiazhuang Mine, Jixi Mulin Mine, and others have ensured workers' spare-time learning time, ensuring that workers have four to six hours of study per week, and some reach eight hours.

    With the development of worker education, the ranks of worker's spare-time teachers have also grown rapidly. At present, there are 430,000 spare-time school teachers nationwide, including 60,000 full-time teachers. The vast majority of these full-time teachers are trained by the factories and enterprises themselves, drawing on the spirit of self-reliance as the mainstay and striving for external assistance as a supplement, by selecting and cultivating a portion of cadres and engineering technical personnel; or by factories adopting collaborative part-time teaching. The Shanghai Smelting Plant adopted a self-reliant approach to solve all the teacher problems of the spare-time school. The courses from literacy, spare-time primary school, middle school to university specialty are basically borne by the teachers trained by the factory itself. A larger proportion of teachers in factory and mining spare-time schools are part-time teachers, who are mostly party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League leading cadres of various factories and enterprises or selected technical personnel and workers. In order to adapt to the rapid development and improvement of worker education, many regions have also established teacher training networks from the city, district to the grassroots level, including refresher colleges for systematically improving teachers, short-term full-time language and mathematics training courses, spare-time normal schools, and part-work, part-study teacher study classes; at the same time, strengthening teaching research activities, organizing new and old teachers to improve their professional level and teaching quality through various methods such as mutual observation, guidance, and listening to lectures.

    The rapid development of national worker education has brought about significant changes in the cultural outlook of workers across the country. In the early days of liberation, illiterates and semi-illiterates accounted for 80% of the total number of workers nationwide, but now it has dropped to about 20%. In 1959 alone, more than 2 million workers escaped illiteracy and semi-illiteracy. Some enterprises and some cities and counties have also successfully completed the task of basically eliminating illiteracy among existing workers. Now, about half of the workers nationwide have reached the senior elementary school level, and more than 20% have reached the junior high school level or above. Workers' spare-time universities have developed greatly like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. So far, there are 80 workers' spare-time universities in Shanghai, with more than 18,000 students. Harbin and Lushun-Dalian each have more than 30 spare-time universities, of which Harbin has more than 11,000 students. Workers' spare-time schools in factories and mines in various places are not only numerous, but also have a large number of graduates. According to incomplete statistics, the factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building have trained more than 50,000 graduates from various levels of spare-time schools in 1959. Once the broad masses of workers and peasants master culture and science and technology, they will give fuller play to their creativity and enthusiasm in production. Gou Wenbin, deputy director of the Chongqing Enamel Factory, was an apprentice when he entered the factory in 1950 and only had elementary school education. In recent years, he has worked hard and seized spare time to study, constantly improving operating methods and production tools, and solving many major scientific and technical problems. For example, Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory extensively organized workers to study politics, culture, and technology. Over the past decade, the factory has trained 489 technical cadres from workers, and 60% of cadres and 50% of engineers are selected from workers.

    The tremendous achievements of the great leap forward in national worker education for two consecutive years are due to the conscientious implementation of the Party's education policy and the "walking on two legs" policy under the leadership of the Party; especially since the National Workers' Education Conference of Factory and Mining Enterprises in March 1959, worker education committees, worker education leading groups, or other leading organizations under the leadership of the Party committees have been established in various parts of the country. Under the unified leadership of the Party, educational administrative departments, enterprise management departments, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and women's federations have also strengthened their work in worker education. Many enterprises have established spare-time school affairs committees or other leading organizations under the leadership of the Party committees, formulated plans for the development of worker education, and uniformly arranged production and education according to the principle of "combining production and teaching according to aptitude," thus enabling a new situation of double leap forward in production and worker spare-time education to emerge in various places.

    全国职工业余教育飞跃发展
    半数职工达到高小水平　五分之一的职工达到初中或初中以上程度
    新华社25日讯　在全国工农业生产取得连续两年大跃进的同时，全国职工业余教育也出现了持续大跃进的新局面。目前，一个人人立雄心，树大志，普遍坚持业余学习攀登文化科学高峰的文化革命高潮，正在全国工矿企业的广大职工中形成。
    目前，无论从大中城市的工矿企业到边远的林区、矿山，或从有集中学习条件的现代化工厂到分散流动的基建工地、铁路沿线，都有职工在坚持业余学习。据统计，全国参加各级各类业余学校学习的职工约占职工总人数的一半以上，比1958年增加50％多。其中，正在业余高等学校及函授大学学习的职工有十七万人，在业余中等学校（包括初技、中技学校）学习的职工有四百七十多万，在高小学习的约七百万人。黑龙江省和上海、旅大、沈阳、天津、西安等职工业余教育发展较快的地区，很多厂矿企业80％的职工参加了经常性业余学习。今年以来，各地厂矿企业在保证生产上开门红的同时，也保证了职工教育开门红。上海市绝大部分职工业余学校学员坚持了学习，出席率在80％以上。大连造船厂一批过去没有参加学习的老工人，今年也积极报名入学了。
    全国职工业余教育，经过1958—1959连续两年的大跃进，已经由过去高潮此起彼伏的状况走向大发展大提高的新阶段。许多地区做到了经常化、持久化。一些主要城市、工矿区和大型企业并举办了从小学到大学的各级各类业余学校，以及培养管理干部和技术人材的短期训练班、半工半读学校和脱产进修的学习班等。办学形式上也灵活多样，大中型企业多采取工厂和车间两级办学；小型企业有自办、按行业办、就近地区各厂联办以及由地区举办等各种形式。去年9月份，全国国营煤矿系统举办起业余文化学校、业余中等专业学校和业余大学二千四百五十多所。由于教育密切结合生产，开滦赵家庄矿、鸡西穆林矿等都保证了职工业余学习时间，做到职工每周有四至六小时学习，有的达到八小时。
    随着职工教育的发展，职工余业教师的队伍也很快地壮大起来。目前，全国共有业余学校教师四十三万人，其中专职教师达六万人。这些专职教师绝大部分是由各工厂企业根据自力更生为主、力争外援为辅的精神，自行抽调一部分干部、工程技术人员培养起来的；或由各工厂之间采取协作兼课的方式解决的。上海冶炼厂采取自力更生的办法，解决了业余学校的全部师资问题。全厂从扫盲、业余小学、中学到大学专科的课程，基本上都由厂里自己培养的教师负担。占厂矿业余学校教师中更大比重的是兼职教师，他们多由各厂企业的党、政、工、团领导干部或挑选一部分技术人员、工人担任。为了适应职工教育迅速发展和提高的需要，很多地区并建立了从市、区到基层的教师培训网，其中包括系统提高教师的进修学院，短期脱产的语文、数学训练班，业余师范学校以及半工半读的教师学习班等；同时，加强教学研究活动，组织新老教师用互相观摩、辅导、听课等各种办法提高教师的业务水平和教学质量。
    全国职工教育的飞跃发展，使全国职工的文化面貌起了显著变化。解放初期，全国职工中文盲和半文盲占总人数80％，现在已经下降到20％左右。仅1959年就有二百多万职工摆脱了文盲和半文盲状态。有些企业及有的市县并且胜利完成了基本扫除现有职工中文盲的任务。现在，全国职工中约有半数已经达到高小水平，有20％以上达到初中或初中以上程度。职工业余大学像雨后春笋般地得到大发展，到目前止，上海市已有八十所职工业余大学，有一万八千多名学员。哈尔滨市、旅大市都各有业余大学三十多所，其中哈尔滨市有一万一千多名学员。各地厂矿职工业余学校不仅举办得多，而且已有大批毕业生。据不完全统计，第一机械工业部所属各厂1959年已经培养出各级业余学校毕业生五万多人。广大工农群众一旦掌握了文化和科学技术，在生产中就更充分地发挥了创造性和积极性。重庆市搪瓷厂副厂长苟文彬，1950年进厂时是一个学徒，只有小学文化程度。几年来，他刻苦钻研，抓紧业余时间学习，不断地改进操作方法和生产工具，解决了很多重大科学技术问题。又如，戚墅堰机车车辆工厂广泛组织工人学习政治、文化、技术，全厂十年来从工人中培养出四百八十九名技术干部，60％干部和50％的工程师是从工人中选拔出来的。
    全国职工教育连续两年取得大跃进的巨大成就，是由于在党的领导下，认真地贯彻了党的教育方针和两条腿走路的方针；特别是自1959年3月全国厂矿企业职工教育工作会议以后，全国各地都建立了党委领导下的职工教育委员会、职工教育领导小组或其他领导机构。在党的统一领导下，教育行政部门、企业主管部门、工会、共青团、妇联也都加强了职工教育方面的工作。很多企业已经建立了党委领导下的业余学校校务委员会或其他领导机构，制订了职工教育的发展的规划，根据“结合生产、因材施教”的原则，统一安排了生产和教育，因而使各地出现生产、职工业余教育双跃进的新局面。（附图片）
