    Develop Technical Innovations and Create More Famous Brands
    New Developments in the Technical Innovation Movement in the Lüda Light Industry System

    (By our newspaper) Lüda City's light industrial system, in its technical innovation movement, while focusing on mechanization and semi-mechanization to address manual operations, has also concentrated on high-grade, precision, and cutting-edge products, and on creating famous brands, achieving a great harvest.

    Since December 1959, the factories under the Lüda City Light Industry Bureau have put forward more than 23,000 innovation proposals, of which more than 146 were major projects, and more than 100 have been implemented. The implementation of these proposals not only solved key production problems but also saved 798 workers.

    In order to deepen the technical innovation movement, the Lüda City Light Industry Bureau recently put forward new requirements to all units, asking each factory to gradually transform old equipment into new modern equipment on the existing basis, produce more new products, and stride forward to high-grade, precision, and cutting-edge products and famous brands. Subsequently, encouraged by the slogan "Learn from Shanghai, Catch up with Shanghai, Develop More New Varieties, and Create Famous Brands," innovation projects emerged one after another throughout the city. Weaving workers Xue Changxiu, Wang Shihong, Tian Shengguo, and Wang Shibao of Wafangdian closely cooperated, dared to think and dared to act, restoring the youth of the old, broken combing machine that had been lying dormant in the warehouse. The combing machine has already spun snow-white, soft cotton slivers, which can supply 3,600 spindles of the fine spinning machine, producing 30 pieces of 80-count or higher yarn per month. Using these yarns, Wafangdian Textile Factory has woven 100-count high-grade transparent cloth and 120-count high-grade poplin, and 120-count combed, mercerized, singed high-grade axis thread. The Lüda Cotton Weaving Factory, because it did not have a cloth dyeing machine, had never been able to produce velvet; through technical innovation, the dyeing section used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to transform the old rolling dyeing tank into a velvet dyeing machine. From then on, this factory was able to produce high-grade velvet. In order to bring its products up to the level of Shanghai, the Dalian Metal Products Factory sent people to Shanghai to learn, and after returning to the factory, they summarized a total of 154 innovation projects, striving to achieve them in the first quarter. The Dalian Cellophane Factory also regarded solving quality problems as one of the main contents of carrying out technical innovation, so that cellophane would reach the level of a famous brand this year.

### 开展技术革新多创名牌货  旅大轻工业系统技术革新运动有新发展

    开展技术革新多创名牌货
    旅大轻工业系统技术革新运动有新发展
    本报讯　旅大市轻工业系统在技术革新运动中，针对手工操作大搞机械化与半机械化的同时，大搞高级、精密、尖端产品，大创名牌货，获得了丰收。
    旅大市轻工业局所属各厂自1959年12月以来，共提出革新建议两万三千余件，其中比较重大的项目有一百四十六项，已实现的就有一百余项。这些建议的实现，不但解决了生产关键问题，而且节约出劳动力七百九十八名。
    为使技术革新运动深入一步，最近旅大市轻工业局向各单位提出了新的要求，要求各厂在现有基础上逐步地将旧有设备改为新的近代化设备，生产出更多的新产品，向高级、精密、尖端产品和名牌货大步迈进。接着，全市在“学上海、赶上海，多搞新品种，创立名牌货”的口号鼓舞下，技术革新的项目更是层出不穷。瓦纺织工人薛昌秀、王世红、田盛国、王世宝等人密切合作，敢想敢干，将长眠在库内的破旧的精梳棉机恢复了青春。精梳棉机已吐出了雪白柔软的棉条，可供给细纱机三千六百锭，月产三十件八十支以上的高支纱。利用这些纱，瓦纺已织出了一百支高级透明布和一百二十支高级府绸，一百二十支精梳、丝光、烧毛高级轴线。旅大棉织厂因为没有染布机，从来不能生产平绒；通过技术革新，漂染工段以土洋结合的方法，利用旧有的卷染槽改造成一台平绒染布机。从此，这个厂便能生产高级平绒了。大连金属制品厂为了使产品赶上上海水平，派人到上海学习，回厂后共归纳出一百五十四项革新项目，争取在第一季度内实现。大连玻璃纸厂也把解决质量问题作为开展技术革新的主要内容之一，使玻璃纸在今年内达到名牌货的水平。
