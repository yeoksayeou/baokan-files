Let the Steel "Small Foreign Groups" Play a Greater Role
Liu Peng, Deputy Director of the Industrial Work Department of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Our province's steel industry used to be a blank slate. In 1958, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the people of the entire province resolutely implemented the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and cheaper results in building socialism," and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies. They launched a mass movement to make steel, which enabled the steel industry to blossom all over our province and rapidly grow stronger.

Starting from "Indigenous"

In recent years, all socialist construction endeavors in our province have been advancing rapidly, and the demand for steel has increased rapidly. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we have become more acutely aware of the shortage of steel and realized that only by vigorously developing the steel industry can we accelerate the process of socialist construction. How can we rapidly develop the steel industry? The Party's "walking on two legs" policy of developing large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously, and using both indigenous and foreign methods of production, pointed out a clear direction for us. Some regions began to experiment with indigenous methods of iron smelting before August 1958. After the Party Central Committee issued the great call for the entire party and all the people to make steel, the people of the entire province immediately responded enthusiastically and quickly launched a vigorous and massive mass movement to make steel throughout the province. Millions of people went to the mountains to mine coal and dig ore, working day and night. At that time, on the one hand, we were grasping the construction of medium-sized steel plants, and on the other hand, we were mainly establishing various indigenous iron smelting furnaces and indigenous steel smelting furnaces. At the same time, we also built some small blast furnaces combining indigenous and foreign methods and a small number of small foreign blast furnaces and small converters, so that iron smelting furnaces and steel smelting furnaces quickly became popular in cities and villages, forming a magnificent scene of flowing molten iron and splashing steel flowers. Relying on these thousands of indigenous furnaces and some small foreign furnaces, relying on indigenous mining and indigenous coking, after a short four months, the province produced more than 500,000 tons of pig iron and 250,000 tons of steel (including more than 50,000 tons of foreign steel), overfulfilling the tasks assigned by the state. At the same time, a steel industrial contingent with high political consciousness and a certain level of technical expertise began to grow and strengthen, and the prototypes of steel industrial bases such as Jinan, Zibo, Qingdao, and Changwei were initially formed.

In 1959, our province, on the one hand, grasped the construction of key steel plants and key mines, and on the other hand, summarized the experience of the mass steelmaking campaign in 1958. Based on the principles of proximity to mines, proximity to coal, and convenient transportation, we carried out the work of fixing locations, staffing, grouping, fixing furnaces, and fixing leadership for the steel industry, so that the furnace groups basically realized factoryization and baseization. Immediately afterwards, technical transformation of small blast furnaces and small converters was carried out. At the same time, a number of small and medium-sized blast furnaces and converters were newly built in a planned way, so that the steel industry rapidly rose from the stage of "small indigenous groups" to the stage of "small foreign groups."

A Year of Tremendous Change

Our province's steel industry has gradually grown up following the Party's "walking on two legs" policy of developing large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously and using both indigenous and foreign methods of production, through a process of development from small to large and from indigenous to foreign. Practice over the past year has proven that this is a correct road for developing the steel industry with greater, faster, better, and cheaper results. Up to now, our province not only has relatively modern iron and steel complexes like Jinan Iron and Steel Plant, but also has more than 150 large and small iron and steel bases all over the province. About 600 small blast furnaces with a volume of 13 cubic meters and 3 cubic meters are in normal production, with a volume of 3,500 cubic meters, accounting for 64% of the total blast furnace volume put into production in the province. Small converters of less than one ton account for 50% of the province's converter capacity. Of the dozens of large and small mines in the province, only one is a large-scale modern one. All coking is done with indigenous coke ovens and semi-indigenous and semi-foreign coke ovens. This "small foreign group" team can not only smelt good iron, but also smelt good steel and roll good steel. It plays a huge role in the current stage of steel production in our province.

In the beginning, the biggest problem encountered in the production technology of small blast furnaces was how to reduce the sulfur content of iron to the standard stipulated by the state. Through the hard work and ingenuity of the iron smelting workers, high sulfur was quickly overcome, and good iron was produced by small blast furnaces. Smelting steel with high-sulfur iron containing 0.3% to 0.5% sulfur was also an arduous struggle. The steelmaking fighters actively promoted the advanced experience of hot-blast alkaline steelmaking, and after several months of efforts, overcame a series of difficulties, and finally smelted qualified steel from high-sulfur iron. At present, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the province has reached 1.2, the coke ratio has been reduced to 1.2, the qualified rate of pig iron has reached 80%, and the qualified rate of converter steel has reached more than 90%. Steel costs this year have been reduced by more than 40% compared to last year. With its vigorous vitality, the "small foreign group" has overcome numerous difficulties in the process of growth and development.

Intensively and extensively carrying out socialist labor competitions centered on technological innovation and technological revolution on the steel industrial front, and actively promoting various advanced experiences, is an important guarantee for the rapid development of production. Our province launched the "Six Comparisons" red flag competition at the beginning of last year, which later developed into learning, comparison, catching up, and helping opponent competitions, counterpart competitions, "one-dragon" collaboration competitions, and technical performance competitions. Through this series of competitions, a colorful situation of technological innovation appeared in the province's steel industry. On small blast furnaces, the twelve advanced experiences of high yield, high quality, and low cost proposed by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry were promoted, the technical transformation of small blast furnaces was vigorously carried out, and measures such as strong wind and high temperature, increasing smelting intensity, ore sintering, improving raw material supply, and implementing desulfurization inside and outside the furnace were generally adopted. We also seized the advanced experience of high yield, high quality, and low cost of the iron smelting experimental plant of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee organs, and the smelting workshop of Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory, etc., and carried out comprehensive promotion through holding on-site meetings, holding training courses, and printing and distributing booklets. This has continuously and rapidly improved the production technology level of small blast furnaces. By the end of December last year, 78 small blast furnaces with a volume of 3 cubic meters and 13 cubic meters in the province had a utilization coefficient of over 2, a quality of 95% to 100%, and a coke ratio reduced to around 0.8. In steelmaking, the experience of the Tianjin Steelmaking Conference of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the advanced steelmaking experience of Qingdao were promoted. In mining, the experience of indigenous mechanization of Xiangshan Iron Mine in Yantai was promoted. In coking, the experience of indigenous coking of Xuecheng Coke Factory was promoted, and so on. The promotion of this series of advanced experiences has made the mass movement of steel production rise one wave higher than another, the daily production level has risen step by step, and the management of enterprises has also been greatly improved.

In just over a year, our province's steel industry has achieved tremendous achievements. This is a victory for the Party's general line of building socialism and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, a victory for centralized leadership and large-scale mass movements, and a victory for large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution.

Comprehensive Improvement

1960 is a year of continued leap forward. On the one hand, the steel front in our province must continue to undertake the glorious task of supplying iron for steelmaking in Shanghai, and on the other hand, it must supply the steel needed for the continued leap forward of production and construction in our province. This requires an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in steel production. Not only must production continue to grow in terms of output, but also all other technical and economic indicators must be greatly improved on the basis of 1959. That is to achieve high yield, high quality, multiple varieties, and low cost.

Is it possible for us to meet this requirement? The answer is absolutely yes. After the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959, we have more abundant experience. We have established a batch of "small foreign groups" from mining to steel rolling, and we have a production base with a certain scale. The technical level of workers has been greatly improved. Especially after the anti-rightist struggle and the encouragement of hard work, the political enthusiasm of the vast number of workers has been unprecedentedly high. As long as we can hold high the red flag of the general line, adhere to a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, continue to strengthen leadership, implement political command, and continue to consolidate and improve the current mass production upsurge, we will definitely be able to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

In 1960, we will continue to grasp the construction of modern key steel plants and key mines, which are the backbone of our steel industry. At the same time, we must continue to carry forward the fine tradition of self-reliance and hard work of the "small foreign groups," and continue to consolidate, improve, and develop them through large-scale mass movements. According to the specific situation of our province, to further give play to the important role of the "small foreign groups," we must continue to implement technical transformation and actively overcome weak links. The current outstanding weak links are the raw material system and the transportation system. In 1960, in the raw material system, first of all, while grasping the construction of key mines, we must actively transform small mines so that those mines with abundant mineral resources and development prospects that are mined by indigenous methods can gradually realize semi-mechanization and mechanization and improve mining capacity. Secondly, develop the coking industry. In addition to grasping the production and construction of coal washing plants, we must actively build Hongqi No. 2 and No. 3 simple coke ovens and 42-hole coke ovens. The original indigenous coke ovens must be generally rectified and improved to meet the needs of further development of the steel industry. In the transportation system, the main task is to solve the problem of short-distance transportation. From the current situation, in addition to building new railway lines according to the national plan, the most effective way is to build light railways and indigenous railways, so that coal mines and coke plants, and mines and iron plants can gradually build railway transportation lines that combine indigenous and foreign methods with both heavy rails, light rails, and indigenous rails. This can greatly reduce the pressure on transportation and greatly benefit the production of steel "small foreign groups."

At the same time, we must also vigorously promote advanced experiences, which is an important measure to further improve steel production. In the process of promoting advanced experiences, on the one hand, we should pay attention to promoting the advanced experiences of other places and brother provinces and cities, and on the other hand, we should pay attention to summarizing and promoting the advanced experiences of local origin. The existing successful experiences in iron smelting, steelmaking, steel rolling, mining, and coking should be universally and comprehensively promoted to make them blossom and bear fruit everywhere.

Steel "small foreign groups" have broad development prospects. In 1960, in terms of organizational measures, we are prepared to gradually unite and develop the existing "small foreign groups" to make them small joint enterprises. In this way, we can form a steel industrial system with large, medium, and small enterprises developing simultaneously throughout the province at the fastest speed. This will surely promote the rapid progress of the entire socialist construction cause in our province. (Attached picture)

    让钢铁“小洋群”发挥更大作用
    中共山东省委工业工作部副部长　刘鹏
    我省钢铁工业原来是个空白点。1958年，全省人民在党中央、毛主席和中共山东省委的正确领导下，坚决贯彻执行了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，开展了大炼钢铁的群众运动，才使钢铁工业在我们省内遍地开花，并且迅速成长壮大起来。
    从“土”起家
    几年来，我省各项社会主义建设事业都在突飞猛进地向前发展，钢铁的需要量迅速增加；特别自1958年大跃进开始以后，我们更突出地感到钢铁的不足，认识到只有大力发展钢铁工业才能加速社会主义建设的进程。怎样迅速发展钢铁工业呢？党的大中小型企业并举、土法和洋法生产并举的“两条腿走路”的方针，给我们指出了明确的方向。有的地区在1958年8月以前就开始试用土法炼铁。党中央发出全党全民大办钢铁的伟大号召以后，全省人民立即热烈响应，迅速在全省范围内掀起了轰轰烈烈、声势浩大的大办钢铁的群众运动。千万人上山采煤、挖矿，昼夜奋战。当时，我们一方面抓紧中型钢铁厂的建设，另一方面主要是建立各种各样的土炼铁炉和土炼钢炉，同时也建立了一些土洋结合的小高炉和少部分洋的小高炉、小转炉，使炼铁炉、炼钢炉迅速地普及城市和乡村，形成了一个铁水奔流、钢花四溅的壮丽局面。就依靠这千万座土炉和部分小洋炉，依靠土法采矿，土法炼焦，经过短短四个月的时间，全省生产了五十多万吨生铁和二十五万吨钢（其中洋钢五万余吨），超额完成了国家交给的任务。同时，一支既有高度政治觉悟又有一定技术水平的钢铁工业队伍开始成长壮大起来，并且初步形成了济南、淄博、青岛、昌潍等钢铁工业基点的雏型。
    1959年，我省一方面抓紧重点钢铁厂和重点矿山的建设，一方面总结了1958年群众大办钢铁的经验，根据就矿、就煤和交通便利的原则，进行了钢铁工业定点、定员、定组、定炉、定领导的工作，使炉群基本上实现了工厂化、基地化。紧接着，进行了小高炉、小转炉的技术改造。同时，有计划地新建了一批中小型高炉和转炉，使钢铁工业由“小土群”迅速上升到“小洋群”的阶段。
    一年巨变
    我省钢铁工业是遵循党的大中小型企业并举、土法和洋法生产并举的“两条腿走路”的方针，经过由小到大、由土到洋的发展过程，逐步成长起来的。一年来的实践证明，这是一条多快好省地发展钢铁工业的正确道路。到目前为止，我省不仅有了济南钢铁厂那样的比较现代化的钢铁联合企业，而且有了遍及全省的一百五十多个大大小小的钢铁基点。全省正常生产的十三立方和三立方的小高炉约六百座，容积三千五百立方米，占全省投入生产的高炉容积的64％；一吨以下的小转炉占全省转炉容量的50％；全省大大小小的几十个矿山，只有一个是大型现代化的；炼焦全部是土焦炉和半土半洋的焦炉。这支“小洋群”队伍，不仅可以炼出好铁，而且可以炼出好钢，轧出好钢材。它在我省现阶段钢铁生产中起着巨大作用。
    开始时，在小高炉生产技术方面遇到的最大问题，是如何把铁的含硫量降低到国家规定的标准。经过广大炼铁职工的苦干巧干，高硫很快被战胜了，小高炉生产出了好铁。用含硫0．3％到0．5％的高硫铁炼钢，也是个艰巨的斗争。炼钢战士们积极推广了热风碱性炼钢的先进经验，经过几个月的努力，克服了一系列的困难，终于用高硫铁炼出了合格钢。目前，全省小高炉的平均利用系数达到一点二，焦比降至一点二，生铁合格率达到80％，转炉钢的合格率达到90％以上；钢铁成本今年比去年降低了40％以上。“小洋群”以它的茁壮的生命力，战胜了成长过程中的重重困难，发展壮大起来了。
    在钢铁工业战线上，深入广泛地开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的社会主义劳动竞赛，积极推广各种先进经验，是生产迅速发展的重要保证。我省从去年年初就开展了“六比”红旗竞赛，后来发展到学、比、赶、帮的对手赛、对口赛、“一条龙”协作赛和技术表演赛。通过这一系列的竞赛，全省钢铁工业出现了技术革新万紫千红的局面。在小高炉上，推广了冶金工业部提出的高产、优质、低成本的十二条先进经验，大力进行了小高炉的技术改造，普遍采取了强风高温、提高冶炼强度、矿石烧结、改善原料供应、实行炉内炉外脱硫等措施。我们还抓住省委和省人委机关炼铁试验厂、济南印染厂冶炼车间等先进高炉高产、优质、低成本的经验，通过召开现场会议，举办训练班、印发小册子等办法，进行了全面的推广。这样便使小高炉的生产技术水平不断迅速提高。到去年12月下旬，全省已有七十八座三立方米和十三立方米的小高炉，利用系数达到二以上，质量达到95％至100％，焦比降低到零点八左右。在炼钢方面，推广了冶金工业部天津炼钢会议上的经验和青岛的先进炼钢经验；在采矿方面，推广了烟台祥山铁矿土机械化的经验；在炼焦方面，推广了薛城焦厂土法炼焦的经验，等等。这一系列先进经验的推广，使钢铁生产的群众运动一浪高过一浪，日产水平步步上升，企业的管理工作也大大改善了。
    仅仅一年多的时间，我省钢铁工业就取得了巨大的成就，这是党的建设社会主义的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”方针的胜利，是集中领导和大搞群众运动的胜利，是大搞技术革新和技术革命的胜利。
    全面提高
    1960年是继续跃进的一年。我省钢铁战线一方面要继续担负供应上海炼钢用铁的光荣任务，一方面要供应本省生产建设继续跃进对钢铁的需要。这就要求钢铁生产有一个更大更好更全面的跃进。不仅在产量方面要继续增长，其他各项技术经济指标也要在1959年的基础上大大提高一步。这就是要达到高产，优质，多品种，低成本。
    我们有没有可能达到这种要求呢？回答是完全可能的。经过1959年的继续大跃进，我们有了更丰富的经验；已经建立起一批从采矿到轧钢的“小洋群”，有了一个具有一定规模的生产基础，工人的技术水平大大提高了；特别是经过反右倾，鼓干劲，广大职工的政治热情空前高涨。只要我们能够高举总路线的红旗，坚持一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，继续加强领导，实行政治挂帅，把当前的群众性生产高潮继续巩固和提高，我们就一定能够实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
    1960年，我们将继续抓紧现代化的重点钢铁厂和重点矿山的建设，这是我们钢铁工业的骨干；同时，要继续发扬“小洋群”那种自力更生、艰苦奋斗的优良传统，通过大搞群众运动，使之继续巩固提高和发展。根据我省的具体情况，要进一步发挥“小洋群”的重大作用，必须继续实行技术改造，积极克服薄弱环节。目前突出的薄弱环节，是原料系统和运输系统。1960年，在原料系统，首先要在抓紧重点矿山建设的同时，积极改造小矿山，使那些矿藏丰富、有发展前途的土法开采的矿山，能够逐步地实现半机械化和机械化，提高开采能力。其次，发展炼焦工业。除了抓紧煤炭洗选厂的生产和建设外，要积极建设红旗二、三号简易炼焦炉和四十二孔焦炉；对于原有的土焦炉，要普遍进行整顿和提高，使之适应钢铁工业进一步发展的需要。在运输系统，主要是解决短距离运输问题。从目前的情况看来，除了按照国家计划修建新的铁路线外，最有效的办法，是修建轻便铁路和土铁路，使煤矿到焦厂之间、矿山到铁厂之间逐步建成既有重轨又有轻轨和土轨的土洋结合的铁路运输线。这样就可以大大减轻运输方面的压力，大大有利于钢铁“小洋群”的生产。
    与此同时，还必须大力推广先进经验，这是进一步提高钢铁生产的重要措施。在推广先进经验过程中，一方面要注意推广外地的、兄弟省市的先进经验，另一方面要注意总结和推广本地的、土生土长的先进经验。炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、采矿、炼焦等方面现有的成功经验，要普遍地全面地推广，使之到处开花结果。
    钢铁“小洋群”有着广阔的发展前途。1960年，在组织措施方面，我们准备逐步地把现有的“小洋群”加以联合、发展，使之成为小型的联合企业。这样就能够用最快的速度在全省范围内形成一个大中小型企业并举的钢铁工业的体系。这必将促进我省整个社会主义建设事业的飞速前进。（附图片）
