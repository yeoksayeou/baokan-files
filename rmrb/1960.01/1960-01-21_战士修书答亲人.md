After the publication of the poem "Old Woman Writes a Letter to a Relative" in this newspaper on January 6th, the editorial department has successively received poems from some officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, enthusiastically responding to the sentiments of the old woman in the poem. We now publish two of them. From here, we can see the People's Liberation Army soldiers' love for the Party, the people, and the socialist cause of the motherland.

    战士修书答亲人
    1月6日本版上发表了“大娘修书寄亲人”一诗后，编辑部陆续收到一些解放军官兵寄来的诗，热情地回答诗里那位大娘的心意，现在选登两首。从这里，我们能看到人民战士热爱党，热爱人民，热爱祖国社会主义事业的感情。
