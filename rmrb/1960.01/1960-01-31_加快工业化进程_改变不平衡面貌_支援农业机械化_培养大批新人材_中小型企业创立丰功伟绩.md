Xinhua News Agency, 30th Dispatch: A Xinhua News Agency reporter's commentary: The small and medium-sized enterprises that have rapidly grown in China's industrial sector have demonstrated their abilities in the continued great leap forward of the national economy in 1959. With their indelible merits, they have eloquently proven that enterprises run by local authorities, small and medium-sized, and producing with simple methods have infinitely strong vitality and broad development prospects; they have proven that the policy of simultaneously developing large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises is of utmost importance to ensuring the great leap forward of China's industry.

The vigorous rise of small and medium-sized enterprises in China's industrial sector reflects the great ambition of the broad masses of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party, to develop industry at high speed and rapidly change China's "poor and blank" economic landscape; it reflects the enormous power of launching mass movements on the industrial front. This mass movement, under the ideological inspiration of Chairman Mao, started from the base point of the broad masses vigorously running steel production with "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" in the great leap forward of the national economy in 1958. According to preliminary statistics, the number of small and medium-sized enterprises that have been built and put into production nationwide includes: more than 1,000 iron and steel enterprises, more than 17,000 coal mines, power stations with more than 500,000 kilowatts, more than 400 oil plants, more than 100 cement plants, and tens of thousands of machinery factories, chemical factories, and light industry factories.

In 1959, in the continued great leap forward of the national economy, small and medium-sized enterprises, like large enterprises, jointly completed glorious tasks. The main contributions of small and medium-sized enterprises can be summarized as four major achievements:

The first achievement is that, with their high-speed development, they have greatly accelerated the process of China's socialist industrialization. In 1959, the output of major industrial products such as steel, iron, electricity, crude oil, raw coal, cement, sulfuric acid, soda ash, and sugar in China increased by 26% to 115% respectively compared with 1958, and production capacity also increased significantly, with the increase in the production capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises accounting for a large proportion. For example, small and medium-sized iron smelting blast furnaces run by local authorities produced more than half of the country's total pig iron output in 1959, greatly exceeding the country's total pig iron output in 1957; small and medium-sized coal mines run by local authorities produced 40% of the country's total raw coal output in 1959, exceeding the country's total raw coal output in 1957; and the output of small cement plants in 1959 was equivalent to one-third of the country's total cement output in 1957. Thus, it can be seen that the overall great leap forward of China's industry in 1959 was due, on the one hand, to the rapid development of large enterprises, and on the other hand, to the vigorous growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.

The second achievement of small and medium-sized enterprises is that they are mostly distributed in areas where the original industrial base was very weak or even non-existent. Therefore, they have a far-reaching significance for spreading the industrial network across China's vast land and changing the imbalanced distribution of industry in China. Before 1958, China's key iron and steel enterprises were only distributed in eleven provinces and cities. With the establishment of more than 1,000 small and medium-sized iron and steel plants, almost every province, city, and autonomous region in the country, except for a few autonomous regions, now has one or several small iron and steel plants. The iron and steel industry has bloomed everywhere in the motherland and has yielded fruitful results. The small coal mines that developed like mushrooms after a spring rain in 1958 and 1959 were also mostly distributed in the south, which had always been called "coal-free" or "coal-deficient," such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Sichuan. Two years ago, many provinces and regions in China, such as Shandong, Shanxi, Guizhou, and Guangxi, did not produce oil, but in 1959 these regions began to have small artificial oil plants. As for small machinery factories, chemical factories, and light industry factories, they have developed even faster, and there are now almost factories in every county. The rise of small and medium-sized enterprises in iron and steel, machinery, coal, etc. from China's industrial blank areas has laid a preliminary foundation for the development of industry in these areas from small to large. They meet the needs of the broad masses of the people locally with a wide variety of products, and economically and rationally utilize the scattered resources in various parts of China.

The third achievement of small and medium-sized enterprises is that they further adapt to the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production and make industry and agriculture more closely integrated. The tens of thousands of agricultural machinery factories established in various places have become an important force for the vast rural areas to create and repair new and old agricultural implements, improve agricultural production efficiency, and save rural labor. Xin Ding County in Shanxi Province has twenty people's communes, and each commune has established a machinery factory. These machinery factories have formed a semi-mechanized agricultural machinery transformation network, which created and modified more than 27,000 agricultural implements in 1959, increasing work efficiency by one to dozens of times respectively. In terms of water conservancy construction alone, it saved more than 53,000 laborers, equivalent to 40% of the county's labor force. The small chemical factories and indigenous fertilizer plants established in Henan Province not only produced a large amount of indigenous fertilizer, but also increased the production of a large number of rubber hoses in the urgent fight against drought, ensuring that irrigation and drainage machinery could operate day and night to irrigate the land. After the rural people's communes were established, many communes newly added tractors, irrigation and drainage machinery, automobiles, etc., and the demand for liquid fuel increased greatly. The small and medium-sized oil plants built and put into production in various places in 1959 produced about 100,000 tons of crude oil, most of which was supplied to the countryside.

The fourth achievement of small and medium-sized enterprises is that they have rapidly and economically cultivated a large number of skilled workers and management cadres for the country. In small and medium-sized iron and steel enterprises alone, millions of farmers became iron and steel workers in 1959, and about 500,000 of them have begun to master production technology in production practice. More importantly, many production experiences and new technologies created in advanced small enterprises and on small equipment have been promoted and applied in large enterprises. There are also some new technical measures that are first tested in small enterprises and then promoted in large enterprises after success, which has also achieved good results.

The large-scale construction of small and medium-sized enterprises has only been a matter of more than a year. The fact that they have been able to make such great achievements in such a short period of time powerfully proves that the vitality of small and medium-sized enterprises is incomparably vigorous and incomparably strong.

These enterprises run by local authorities, small and medium-sized, and producing with simple methods have shown unique advantages from their birth, such as low investment, easy construction, quick results, convenient access to local materials, and the ability to fully utilize scattered resources. After the practice of 1959, a large number of facts have told people: the development of these enterprises in production technology is also advancing by leaps and bounds and changing with each passing day. Taking small iron and steel enterprises as an example: In 1959, not only was a relatively complete set of small blast furnace iron smelting technology explored, but also valuable experience was created in overcoming high sulfur, smelting good steel, and rolling good materials. In the fourth quarter of last year, the average qualified rate of pig iron from small blast furnaces across the country reached 80%, more than double that of the first quarter; the output of iron per cubic meter of blast furnace volume per day and night was more than 0.9 tons, which has exceeded the production level of China's large blast furnaces in 1951; the average coke consumption per ton of iron smelting decreased by 22% compared with the first quarter; and the cost of pig iron also decreased by about one-third compared with the first quarter. In 1959, the small chemical factories in various places not only solved the technical problems of producing three acids (sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid) and two alkalis (soda ash, caustic soda), but also produced many kinds of products that were once considered to have very high technical requirements in the synthetic ammonia industry and the organic synthesis industry. The fact that the production technology of small and medium-sized enterprises progressed rapidly in 1959 gives us sufficient reason to draw a definite conclusion: With the rich experience of 1959, with the tens of thousands of employees who have already mastered these experiences, and with production conditions that are much better than at the beginning of 1959, the small and medium-sized enterprises on the industrial front will surely have a bright future on the broad road of continued leap forward in 1960.

    加快工业化进程  改变不平衡面貌  支援农业机械化  培养大批新人材
    中小型企业创立丰功伟绩
    全国建成和投入生产的中小企业有：钢铁企业一千多个，煤矿一万七千多座，电站五十多万瓩，石油厂四百多个，水泥厂一百多个，机械、化工和轻工业工厂成千上万。
    据新华社30日讯　新华社记者述评：我国工业部门迅速成长起来的中小型企业，在1959年国民经济继续大跃进中大显身手，它们用自己不可磨灭的功勋，雄辩地证明了由地方举办的、中小型的、以简易方法生产的企业，具有无限强大的生命力和远大的发展前途；证明了大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针，对保证我国工业大跃进具有极其重要的意义。
    我国工业部门中小型企业的蓬勃兴起，反映出了我国广大人民，在党的领导下，要求高速度发展工业，迅速改变我国“一穷二白”的经济面貌的壮志雄心；反映出了在工业战线上大搞群众运动的巨大威力。这个群众性的运动，是在毛主席的思想启示下，从1958年国民经济大跃进中，广大群众大办钢铁“小土群”“小洋群”生产的基点开始的。据初步统计，全国已经建成和投入生产的中小型企业有：钢铁企业一千多个，煤矿一万七千多座，电站五十多万瓩，石油厂四百多个，水泥厂一百多个，以及成千上万的机械厂、化工厂、轻工业工厂等。
    1959年，在国民经济继续大跃进中，中小型企业和大型企业一样，共同完成了光荣的任务。中小型企业的主要贡献，可概括为四大功绩：
    第一功是，它以自己的高速度发展，大大加快了我国社会主义工业化的进程。1959年，我国钢、铁、电力、原油、原煤、水泥、硫酸、纯碱、糖等主要工业产品的产量，分别比1958年增加了26％到115％，生产能力也有很大增长，其中中小型企业生产能力的增长占有很大的比重。例如地方举办的中小型炼铁高炉，1959年生产的生铁就占全国总产量的一半以上，大大超过了1957年全国的生铁总产量；地方举办的中小型煤矿，1959年的原煤产量占全国总产量的40％，超过了1957年全国原煤总产量；小型水泥厂1959年的产量，也相当于1957年全国水泥总产量的三分之一。由此可见，1959年我国工业实现全面大跃进，一方面要归功于大型企业的迅速发展，而中小型企业蓬蓬勃勃地成长起来，也是一个重要原因。
    中小型企业的第二功是，它们大都分布在原来工业基础十分薄弱甚至没有工业的空白地区，因而对于在我国辽阔的土地上撒开工业网，改变我国工业分布不平衡的面貌，有着十分深远的意义。1958年以前，我国的重点钢铁企业只分布在十一个省、市，随着一千多个中小型钢铁厂的建立，目前除个别自治区外，全国每个省、市、自治区里都已经有了一个或几个小型钢铁厂，钢铁工业已经在祖国的大地上遍地开花，并且结下了丰硕的果实。1958年和1959年像雨后春笋般发展起来的小煤矿，也大都分布在一向被称为“无煤”“缺煤”的南方，如广东、广西、湖北、福建、浙江、四川等地。两年前，我国还有山东、山西、贵州、广西等许多省区不产石油，而1959年这些地区都开始有了小型的人造石油厂。至于小型机械厂、化工厂、轻工业工厂，就发展得更快，目前已经几乎是县县有厂了。钢铁、机械、煤炭等中小型企业从我国工业空白区勃然兴起，就为这些地区从小到大地发展工业打下了初步的基础。它们以多种多样的产品就地满足广大人民的需要，而且经济合理地利用了我国各地分散的资源。
    中小型企业的第三功是，它进一步适应农业生产大跃进的需要，使工业和农业更加密切地结合起来。各地兴办起来的几万个农业机械工厂，已经成为广大农村创制和修理新旧农具、提高农业生产效率、节约农村劳动力的重要力量。山西忻定县有二十个人民公社，社社建立了机械厂，这些机械厂组成了一个半机械化的农业机具改造网，在1959年创制、改制了二万七千多件农业机具，分别提高工效一倍到几十倍，仅是水利建设方面，就节省了五万三千多个劳动力，等于全县劳动力的40％。河南省办起的小型化工厂和土化肥厂，不仅生产了大量土化肥，而且在紧急的抗旱斗争中，增产了大量胶管，保证了排灌机械日夜开动浇地。农村人民公社化以后，许多公社新添置了拖拉机、排灌机械、汽车等，液体燃料的需要量大增，1959年各地兴建并投入生产的中小型石油厂，生产了约十万吨原油，大部分供应了农村。
    中小型企业的第四功是，为国家迅速而经济地培养了大量技术工人和管理干部。仅在中小型钢铁企业里，1959年就有上百万农民变成了钢铁工人，其中约有五十万人已经在生产实践中开始掌握生产技术。不仅如此，更重要的是，在先进的小型企业和小型设备上创造的许多生产经验和新技术，已在大型企业里推广运用。还有一些新的技术措施，采取先在小型企业里试验，成功后再在大型企业里推行的办法，也收到良好的效果。
    中小型企业的大量兴建，只不过是一年多以来的事。它们能够在如此短促的时间里作出这样的丰功伟绩，这件事本身就有力地证明了中小型企业的生命力是无比旺盛、无比强大的。
    这些由地方举办的、中小型的、以简易方法生产的企业，从它们诞生开始，就显示出投资少、建设易、收效快、便于就地取材、能够充分利用分散的资源等等特有的优点。经过1959年的实践，大量事实已经告诉人们：这些企业在生产技术上的发展，也是突飞猛进，日新月异的。以小型钢铁企业为例：1959年内不仅摸索出了一套比较完整的小高炉炼铁技术，而且还创造了战胜高硫、炼出好钢、轧出好材的宝贵经验。去年第四季度全国小高炉生铁的合格率平均达到80％，比第一季度提高了一倍多；每一立方米高炉容积每昼夜出铁零点九吨以上，这个水平已经超过了1951年我国大高炉的生产水平；每炼一吨铁平均消耗的焦炭，比第一季度减少了22％；生铁成本也比第一季度下降了三分之一左右。各地的小型化工厂，1959年不仅解决了生产三酸（硫酸、硝酸、盐酸）、二碱（纯碱、烧碱）的技术问题，而且还生产了很多种一向被认为是技术要求很高的合成氨工业和有机合成工业的产品。中小型企业生产技术在1959年飞速进步这一事实，使我们有足够的根据得出一个肯定的结论：有了1959年丰富的经验，有了已经掌握这些经验的成千上万的职工，再加上比1959年初要好得多的生产条件，工业战线上的中小型企业，在1960年继续跃进的康庄大道上，必将鹏程万里，前途无量。（附图片）
