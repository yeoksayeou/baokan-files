"A Chicken Feather Rings the Bell": Where There's a Will, There's a Way
Mao A'mao Creates the "Datong Type I Coal Loading Machine"
After three years of tenacious struggle and more than eighty failures, he created a coal loading machine,
Eliminating the last manual operation in the coal mining face.
(Our Dispatch) Correspondents Zhao Sen and Yang Sen report: Mao A'mao, a worker at the Tongjialiang Mine of the Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi Province, after three years of effort and more than eighty failures, successfully created the "Datong Type I Coal Loading Machine." This machine can load 60 tons of coal per hour and can replace the labor of 24 people. A coal loading machine is a mechanical device used to load produced coal onto coal transport vehicles. In the past, this process was entirely manual, resulting in very low labor efficiency. The creation of the "Datong Type I Coal Loading Machine" greatly enhances the efficiency of coal transportation.

Before Mao A'mao created the coal loading machine, some people who liked to look at things superficially did not believe that the seemingly ordinary Mao A'mao could create such a machine.

When Mao A'mao initiated the manufacturing of the coal loading machine, some people asserted: "It's like trying to ring a bell with a chicken feather, it won't make a sound!" They believed that there were plenty of capable people in the world, and none had solved the problem of manual coal loading; how could Mao A'mao, a "roughneck," dare to boast so grandly.

However, facts have proven that the chicken feather did ring the bell! He has a heart loyal to socialism.
Mao A'mao is an ordinary worker in the mechanical branch of the Tongjialiang Mine of the Datong Coal Mine. In appearance, he is short, with a thin face, and doesn't speak much. He doesn't seem to have any exceptional qualities. However, he has a heart loyal to socialism. People who know Mao A'mao know that his fiery heart has been forged through countless trials. When he was still a child, his mother died from the torments of hunger and cold, and then his father, who had been a sedan carrier his whole life, also died. This orphan, with nowhere to turn, wandered to Shanghai and became a child laborer.

After liberation, the working class leaped from slaves to masters of the country. Mao A'mao, as sensitive as a touchstone, immediately felt the warmth of the new society and loved it from the bottom of his heart. How should a master act, and how should a beautiful socialist society be built? These were things he pondered in his heart all day long. As early as the spring of 1956, the mechanical branch sent him to Mine No. 9 for the first time to repair the carriage tiles. After Mao A'mao went down into the mine, he saw that most of the production process was mechanized, but only coal loading and cart pushing were still heavy physical labor, especially coal loading, which required even more effort but had very low efficiency. When he learned about these conditions, he became very uneasy. He thought: The Party often calls on us to find ways to increase labor productivity. Now that we are still loading coal manually, isn't this a problem that our mechanical workers should solve? From then on, he made a firm resolution to create a coal loading machine to replace manual coal loading.

Battling Difficulties from the Start
However, after proposing this task, Mao A'mao became worried. First, he feared that the leadership would not support him; second, he was afraid of being laughed at if he failed. He couldn't resolve this knot in his mind. After thinking it over, he finally decided to seek help from the Party organization. Comrade Su Benyuan, the branch secretary, expressed his firm support for him and said, "Roads are made by people walking on them. When walking, you will inevitably encounter some twists and turns, but as long as you walk, you will always be able to get through." Mao A'mao felt energized after hearing these words.

However, doing things is never as easy as talking about them. Mao A'mao didn't know many characters and didn't have much education. He had never done any design work and didn't understand the principles. Now he had to pick up a pen to draw, but he couldn't hold the pen still. To draw a blueprint, he didn't know how many drawings he had looked at, how many machines he had seen, or how many experienced technicians he had consulted. He wanted to make this machine so much that he forgot to eat and forgot to sleep. It took him a full four months to finally draw a rough sketch. Failure then renewed effort, difficulties giving way to progress.
After the rough sketch was drawn, the Party committee immediately approved his trial production. This made Mao A'mao extremely happy. He found some scrap steel and worked from before dawn until late at night, quickly producing it according to the sketch. When the miners heard that Mao A'mao had made a coal loading machine, they were naturally very happy. Many people even came to watch the coal loading machine's demonstration. Unexpectedly, this coal loading machine failed during the demonstration.

However, with the support of the Party organization, Mao A'mao did not lose heart and continued to devote all his energy to the trial production of the coal loading machine. After studying diligently, he modified the coal loading machine again. The test results were again a failure.

Despite one failure after another, Mao A'mao did not lose heart. Especially when he saw those coal loading workers panting from exhaustion, and when he saw many coal loading workers getting sick from overwork, his courage to overcome difficulties grew even stronger.

Machine is Born: A Chicken Feather Rings the Bell
Although Mao A'mao's long-term hard work had given the coal loading machine a basic form, he couldn't solve the problem of it only spinning but not moving forward. Just when Mao A'mao needed help, the Tongjialiang Mine Party Committee decided to form an innovation group composed of administrative personnel, technical cadres, and veteran workers to help Mao A'mao solve difficult problems. With more people, there was more wisdom. The technicians explained from a theoretical perspective, and the veteran workers thought from a practical perspective. With everyone contributing, the problem that Mao A'mao had been unable to solve for a long time was resolved.

After the trial production was successful, the mine held a final demonstration. The demonstration results showed that this coal loading machine could load 60 tons of coal per hour and could do the work of 24 people in one day. Because it eliminated the last manual operation in the coal mining face and freed the coal loading workers from heavy physical labor, the coal loading workers composed a rhyme for it: "Coal loading machine, coal loading machine, high efficiency, low cost, moves like a bird, loads coal as fast as lightning, climbs slopes, walks on洼地, just like children playing games." The Datong Coal Mine Committee of the Chinese Communist Party officially named it the "Datong Type I Coal Loading Machine" and decided to promote it universally throughout the bureau. Those people who originally compared A'mao to a "chicken feather" now dare not say "a chicken feather cannot ring the bell" anymore. (Attached photo)

### “鸡毛打响了钟”　有志者事竟成  毛阿毛制成“大同一型装煤机”

    “鸡毛打响了钟”　有志者事竟成
    毛阿毛制成“大同一型装煤机”
    顽强斗争三年，经过八十多次失败，制成了装煤机，
    消灭了回采工作面中最后一道用手工操作的工序
    本报讯　通讯员赵森、杨森报道：山西大同煤矿同家梁矿工人毛阿毛经过三年的努力，大小八十多次的失败，创造成功了“大同一型装煤机”。这台机器每小时可装煤六十吨，能代替二十四个人劳动。装煤机是将生产的煤炭装到运煤车上去的一种机械设备。过去，这道工序全部使用人工，劳动效率很低。“大同一型装煤机”的制成，对提高煤炭运输效率作用很大。
    在毛阿毛制成装煤机以前，一些喜欢从表面看问题的人，谁都不相信看来十分平凡的毛阿毛，竟会创造出装煤机来。
    当毛阿毛发起制造装煤机的时候，有些人曾经断言：“保险是鸡毛打钟，没音！”他们认为天下能人多得很，没有一个能解决手工装煤问题；他毛阿毛一个“老粗”，怎么敢吹这么大的牛。
    但是，事实证明，鸡毛硬把钟打响了！有一颗忠于社会主义的心
    毛阿毛是大同煤矿同家梁矿机械分厂的一位普通工人，从外表看，矮矮的个子，瘦瘦的脸庞，少言寡语，确实没有甚么过人的地方。不过，他有一颗忠于社会主义的心。了解毛阿毛的人，都晓得他这颗火热的心，是经过千锤百炼炼成的。还在他幼年的时候，母亲就为饥寒折磨死了，接着当了一辈子轿夫的父亲也相继亡命。他这个孤儿，走投无路，便流浪到上海作了童工。
    解放后，工人阶级从奴隶一跃而为国家的主人，毛阿毛像试金石一样灵敏，一下就感觉出新社会的温暖，从心眼里爱上了新社会。主人翁该怎样个当法，美好的社会主义该怎样个建法，这是他成天在内心里盘算的事儿。还是在1956年春天，机械分厂第一次派他到九号矿井修理车瓦，毛阿毛下井后看到生产过程大部分机械化了，唯有装煤、推车还是笨重的体力劳动，特别是装煤工人费力更大，效率却很低。当他了解到这些情况时，心神便不安起来。他想：党经常号召我们设法提高劳动生产率，如今还用手工装煤，这不是我们机械工人应该解决的问题吗？从此他就立下雄心壮志，决心要制造一台装煤机来代替人工装煤。
    一开始就和困难搏斗
    可是，提出这一课题之后，毛阿毛反而顾虑起来。一来怕领导上不支持他；二来怕干不成惹人笑话。这个疙瘩在他思想上怎么也解不开。思来想去，最后决定去找党组织帮助。支部书记苏本元同志表示坚决支持他，并对他说：“路是人走出来的，在走路的时候免不了要遇到一些曲折，只要走，总是能够走通的。”毛阿毛听了这话，劲头就大起来了。
    不过，事情做起来总不像说起来容易。毛阿毛本来识字不多，文化不高，既没有搞过设计，又不懂原理，如今要拿起笔来绘图，这杆笔就拿不动。为了绘一张图纸，不知找过多少图样，看过多少机器，请教过多少老技工。他想制造这台机器，想得忘记了吃饭忘记了睡觉。整整费了四个多月的时间，终于绘出了一张草图。失败了再干困难让出路来
    草图绘出后，党委立即批准他试制。这一下可把毛阿毛乐坏了，他找了些废钢铁，起五更睡半夜，很快按着草图制成了。矿工们听说毛阿毛制成了装煤机，自然很高兴。不少人还亲自赶来参观装煤机表演。不料，这架装煤机在表演时失败了。
    但是毛阿毛在党组织的支持下，没有泄气，继续把全副精力都贯注在试制装煤机上。经过刻苦钻研，他又把装煤机改装好了。试验结果，又失败了。
    一次接着一次的失败，毛阿毛并没有灰心。特别是当他看见那些装煤工人累得上气不接下气，看到不少装煤工人劳累成病的时候，克服困难的勇气更足了。
    机器出世鸡毛打响了钟
    毛阿毛经过长期苦干，虽然使装煤机有了个样，但只打转不前进的毛病说什么也解决不了。正在毛阿毛需要人帮助的时候，同家梁矿党委决定由行政人员、技术干部和老工人等组成革新组，协助毛阿毛解决疑难问题。人多智慧广，技术人员从理论上一讲，老工人从实际一想，你一言我一语，把毛阿毛长期以来无法解决的问题解决了。
    试制成功以后，矿上举行了最后一次表演。表演结果，这台装煤机每小时可装煤六十吨，一天能顶二十四个人干活。由于它消灭了回采工作面最后一道手工工序，把装煤工人从笨重的体力劳动中解脱出来，因此装煤工人们给它编出一首顺口溜：“装煤机，装煤机，效率高，成本低，行动像只鸟，装煤快如飞，爬斜坡，走洼地，就像小孩作游戏。”中共大同煤矿委员会给它正式命名为“大同一型装煤机”，并决定在全局普遍推广。原来那些把阿毛比作“鸡毛”的人，现在他们再也不敢说“鸡毛打不响钟”了。（附图片）
