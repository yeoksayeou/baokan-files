Our country is advancing towards the goal of a socialist nation with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. The socialist construction cause requires the accelerated development of science and technology. From industry to agriculture, from popularization to improvement, from application to theory, from research to promotion, from the present to the long term, scientific research tasks in all aspects need to be completed as soon as possible. We must mobilize all positive factors and make a full-scale advance into science and technology. Therefore, while vigorously strengthening the Chinese Academy of Sciences and its branches in various regions and the research work of industrial departments, we must give full play to the strength of institutions of higher education in scientific research and vigorously strengthen scientific research in institutions of higher education.
    In the past two years, under the impetus of the great leap forward in the national economy and in the process of carrying out the Party's education policy and carrying out the revolution in education in our country, the vast number of teachers and students in institutions of higher education have participated in scientific research. The scientific research projects completed in 1958 far exceeded the total of the previous eight years. Since last year, institutions of higher education have comprehensively implemented the Party's education policy, better combining scientific research with teaching and productive labor, making the achievements in scientific research even more remarkable. In the past year or so, scientific research in institutions of higher education has solved many scientific and technological problems in national construction and made certain contributions to the development of the country's scientific undertakings. At the same time, scientific research has greatly promoted the combination of education and productive labor, improved the scientific level of teachers, enriched teaching content, accelerated the construction of laboratories and teaching materials, promoted the establishment of new majors, and greatly improved teaching quality and students' ability to work independently, which is of great and far-reaching significance for promoting the education revolution.
    Scientific research in institutions of higher education is an important task in higher education in our country, and it is also an important component of our country's scientific and technological work. The basic task of institutions of higher education is to train cadres. Scientific research can improve the level of teachers, enrich teaching content, and enable theory to be linked with practice for the training of cadres in institutions of higher education. However, it is not enough to regard scientific research merely as a method of training cadres. For the important aspect of our country's entire scientific and technological research work, institutions of higher education should also regard scientific research as an important task. Some people believe that scientific research can only be regarded as a "sideline" of institutions of higher education. This view is incorrect. We have seen that teachers and students of Tsinghua University designed the Miyun Reservoir, the largest reservoir in North China with a water storage capacity of 4.1 billion cubic meters, and completed the national task in conjunction with teaching work. Is this a "sideline" that can be done or not? In the past year or so, Fudan University has completed 526 more important scientific research projects, of which 224 were to complete national tasks or solve practical problems in production and construction. Is this also a "sideline" that can be done or not? In the past two years, institutions of higher education have completed tens of thousands of scientific research projects, equipped thousands of large and small laboratories, written tens of thousands of scientific papers, and produced many products. Can these also be regarded as "sidelines"? Institutions of higher education have the possibility and the responsibility to undertake scientific research tasks, serve the socialist construction of the motherland, and contribute to the development of the country's scientific undertakings.
    Institutions of higher education have great potential for scientific research. They have a huge scientific and technological team, with more than 50,000 teachers and more than 500,000 students in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine alone. Most of the people with research capabilities in many provinces and cities are concentrated in institutions of higher education. Therefore, institutions of higher education must be an army of the state's scientific and technological work and conduct full activities in an organized and planned manner. Some people believe that institutions of higher education can only be regarded as "guerrillas" in scientific research. This view is incorrect. Institutions of higher education have experienced scientific workers and a large number of young and vigorous new forces. This is a growing scientific team with a certain scientific and technological level. How can it be said to be a "guerrilla"? Institutions of higher education are widely distributed, can adapt to local needs, and can carry out scientific research work according to the characteristics of local resources and the characteristics of local industrial and agricultural production. How can it be said that it is a "guerrilla"? Institutions of higher education are not only large in number, but also have relatively complete majors. Cooperation between various disciplines will better become an army of the entire national scientific and technological force, which should be fully affirmed.
    The scope of scientific research in institutions of higher education is very wide, including scientific research work of different scientific levels and different forms. It can carry out creative special research work, master new science and technology, carry out research activities, combine internships and productive labor to carry out technological innovation, investigation and research, and can also conduct preliminary training in scientific research for students. The important issue is that schools should arrange the combination of scientific research and teaching productive labor according to the different types, different tasks, different teaching stages, and different conditions of each teaching and research group. Generally, scientific research work closely related to current teaching and productive labor should be carried out first, and then gradually developed into scientific research work that combines a large amount of current teaching and productive labor, and also organizes specialized forces to conduct long-term, special research. Scientific research work starting from the characteristics of the school should adopt the method of "simultaneous development". It should vigorously conduct research on the topics raised in current teaching and production, and also vigorously conduct research on long-term basic theories; it should widely carry out general scientific and technological research, and also pay attention to the development of the latest scientific and technological research. Scientific research and productive labor are also complementary. If the long-term direction of scientific research is emphasized prematurely without considering the conditions, and the topics raised in current teaching and production are neglected, or scientific research is used to replace the necessary productive labor, it will also hinder the development of scientific research in schools and produce the danger of being divorced from reality. All institutions of higher education should, under the leadership of the school party committee, closely combine teaching, productive labor, and scientific research according to the different circumstances of the school, and properly arrange them to achieve mutual promotion and complementary effects.
    In order to better give full play to the scientific research power of institutions of higher education, it is necessary to break superstitions, emancipate the mind, mobilize all positive factors, overcome difficulties, and widely mobilize teachers, students, and staff to participate in scientific research. Local science and technology commissions should, together with the branches of the Academy of Sciences, industrial departments, and educational administrative departments, assist local party committees to comprehensively organize the strength of the research institutes of the Academy of Sciences system, various industrial systems, and various institutions of higher education, and make comprehensive arrangements under the principle of the whole country as a chess game, appropriately arrange scientific research tasks according to the characteristics and expertise of each school, and incorporate them into the scientific and technological development plan. Broad cooperation should be carried out within schools, between schools, and between schools and scientific research institutions and industrial departments, taking the initiative to cooperate, giving play to the spirit of communist cooperation, and helping each other solve difficulties in equipment, technology, etc., to seek common leap forward. People say it well, "A riot of color is spring." No matter how well a flower blooms, it cannot dress up the spring. The characteristic of scientific research in our era is not just a few people closing their doors and studying coldly and quietly, but a magnificent mass upsurge participated by the vast masses, an era of scientific research with a hundred flowers blooming.
    At present, our country's national economy is continuing to leap forward, and the world's science and technology are developing rapidly. In this era, heroes have great use. We have also seen that heroes have emerged in large numbers and made remarkable achievements. Facts have proved that doing a good job in scientific research is of great political significance for accelerating the realization of our country's socialist grand plan and changing our country's "poor and blank" face. Developing our country's scientific undertakings and catching up with the world's advanced level is a glorious and important task. Teachers and students of institutions of higher education should, together with the research institutions of scientific research departments and industrial departments, bravely undertake this task, set great ambitions, make up their minds, boost their energy, and climb the peak. This is our slogan of action.

    把高等学校科学研究工作推向新高峰
    我国正在向具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家的目标前进。社会主义建设事业需要加速发展科学技术。从工业到农业，从普及到提高，从应用到理论，从研究到推广，从当前到长远，各方面的科学研究任务都需要尽快地完成。我们必须调动一切积极因素，向科学技术全面进军。因此在大力加强中国科学院及各地分院和产业部门研究工作的同时，必须充分发挥高等学校在科学研究工作方面的力量，大力加强高等学校科学研究工作。
    两年来，在国民经济大跃进的形势推动下，在贯彻执行党的教育方针进行我国教育事业的大革命的过程中，高等学校广大教师和学生参加了科学研究工作。1958年完成的科学研究项目，远远超过过去八年的总和。去年以来，高等学校全面贯彻执行党的教育方针，更好地把科学研究和教学、生产劳动结合起来，使科学研究工作的成绩更加显著。一年多来，高等学校的科学研究工作，解决了国家建设中的不少科学技术问题，对发展国家科学事业方面作出了一定的贡献。同时，科学研究工作大大推动了教育和生产劳动的结合，提高了教师的科学水平，充实了教学内容，加速了实验室和教材的建设，促进了新专业的建立，大大提高了教学质量和学生独立工作的能力，对于促进教育革命有重大的和深远的意义。
    高等学校的科学研究工作，是我国高等教育工作中一项重要工作，同时又是我国科学技术工作中一个重要的组成部分。高等学校的基本任务是培养干部。科学研究对于高等学校的培养干部来说，可以提高教师水平，丰富教学内容，使理论联系实际。然而，如果把科学研究工作，仅仅当作培养干部的方法，那就不够了。对于作为我们国家整个科学技术研究工作的一个重要方面来说，高等学校又应当把科学研究工作当成一项重要任务。有人认为，科学研究工作只能作为高等学校的“副业”。这种看法，是不正确的。我们看到，清华大学师生设计了华北最大的蓄水四十一亿公方的密云水库，结合教学工作完成了国家任务。这难道是可做可不做的“副业”吗？复旦大学一年多来，全校完成的较重要的科学研究项目有五百二十六项，其中有二百二十四项是完成国家任务或解决生产建设中的实际问题的。难道这也是可做可不做的“副业”吗？两年以来，高等学校完成了几万个科学研究课题，装备了成千个大小实验室，写出了上万篇科学论文，做出了许多产品，难道也能把这些当作“副业”吗？高等学校有可能也有责任来承担科学研究任务，为祖国社会主义建设服务，对发展国家科学事业作出贡献。
    高等学校具有从事科学研究工作的巨大潜力，他们拥有巨大的科学技术队伍，仅理、工、农、医等方面，目前就有五万多教师和五十多万学生。很多省市的具有研究工作能力的人，大部分都集中在高等学校。所以，高等学校必须作为国家科学技术工作的一个方面军，有组织有计划地进行充分的活动。有人认为，高等学校只能作为科学研究工作中的“游击队”，这种看法是不正确的。高等学校有年老的有经验的科学工作者，有大批年青的生气勃勃的新生力量。这是一支具有一定科学技术水平的不断成长壮大的科学队伍，怎么能说是“游击队”呢？高等学校分布面很广，可以适应各地需要，针对各地的资源特点，结合各地工农业生产的特点，开展科学研究工作，又怎能说它是“游击队”呢？高等学校不但数量多，而且专业比较齐全。各门学科共同合作，将更好地成为整个国家科学技术力量的一个方面军，这是应该完全肯定的。
    高等学校科学研究工作的范围是很广的，它包括不同科学水平，不同形式的科学研究工作。它可以进行创造性的专题研究工作，可以掌握新的科学技术，进行带有研究性的活动，可以结合实习、生产劳动进行技术革新、调查研究等工作，也可以对学生进行科学研究的初步训练。重要的问题是学校应该根据各个教研组的不同类型、不同任务、不同教学阶段、不同条件去安排科学研究和教学生产劳动的结合。一般应当首先开展与当前教学、生产劳动密切结合的科学研究工作，然后逐步发展为既有大量的和当前教学、生产劳动结合的科学研究工作，又组织专门力量，进行长远的、专题的研究。从学校的特点出发的科学研究工作，应该采取“同时并举”的办法，既大力进行当前教学和生产中提出的课题的研究，也大力进行长远的基本理论的研究；既广泛展开一般的科学技术的研究，也注意发展最新的科学技术的研究。科学研究和生产劳动也是相辅相成的。如果不问条件，过早地强调选择科学研究的长远方向，忽视当前教学和生产中提出的课题，或者以科学研究代替了必要的生产劳动，那也会阻碍学校科学研究的开展，产生脱离实际的危险。各高等学校应该在学校党委的领导下，根据学校的不同情况，把教学、生产劳动和科学研究三者密切结合，妥善安排，以收相互促进、相辅相成之效。
    为了更好地把高等学校的科学研究力量充分发挥起来，要破除迷信，解放思想，调动一切积极因素，克服困难，广泛发动师生、员工参加科学研究工作。各地科学技术委员会应该会同科学分院、产业部门、教育行政部门，协助地方党委把科学院系统、各产业系统的研究所和各高等学校的力量全面地组织起来，在全国一盘棋的原则下，进行全面安排，根据各校的特点和专长，适当地安排科学研究任务，纳入科学技术发展计划。学校内部、学校之间、学校和科学研究机关以及产业部门之间要展开广泛的协作，主动配合，发挥共产主义协作精神，互相帮助解决设备、技术等困难，求得共同跃进。人们说得好，“万紫千红才是春”。一朵花开得再好，也打扮不出春天来。我们时代科学研究的特点，不是只有少数人关起门来冷冷清清的研究，而是广大群众参加的波澜壮阔的群众热潮，是科学研究百花齐放的时代。
    目前我国国民经济正在继续跃进，世界科学技术又在日新月异地发展。在这个时代里，正是英雄大有用武之地。我们也已经看到，英雄辈出，成绩斐然。事实证明，做好科学研究工作，对于加速实现我国社会主义的宏图大略，改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，具有重大的政治意义。发展我国科学事业，赶上世界先进水平，是一项光荣的重大的任务。高等学校的师生，应该同科学研究部门和产业部门的研究机构一起，勇敢地承担这个任务，立大志，下决心，鼓干劲，攀高峰，就是我们的行动口号。
