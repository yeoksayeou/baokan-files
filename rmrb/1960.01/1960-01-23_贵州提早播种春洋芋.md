Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 21st January: Guizhou province is advancing the planting of spring potatoes in various regions. According to statistics from Zunyi, Bijie, Anshun, Qiannan, Guiyang and other areas, 530,000 mu of spring potatoes have been planted, with planting commencing a month earlier than last year.

This year, Guizhou has drawn on last year's increased potato production experience, and not only is planting earlier, but the planting quality is also high, generally involving deep plowing to eight cun, applying over fifty dan of base fertilizer, and the vast majority adopting ditch planting and staggered row planting. The Bijie area has already planted 330,000 mu of spring potatoes, all using early-maturing, high-yielding, cold-resistant, and disease-resistant superior varieties.

This year, due to the expansion of the spring potato planting area and the implementation of close planting, some areas lack seeds. In order to solve this problem in a timely manner, Party committees at all levels have fully mobilized the masses to carry out cooperation and mutual adjustment based on the principle of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit.

    贵州提早播种春洋芋
    新华社贵阳21日电  贵州省各地提前播种春洋芋。据遵义、毕节、安顺、黔南、贵阳等地区的统计，已播种春洋芋五十三万亩，开始播种的时间比去年提早了一个月。
    今年贵州各地吸取去年洋芋增产经验，不仅播种早，而且播种质量高，一般都深耕八寸，施底肥五十担以上，绝大部分采取了沟播和错窝条播。毕节专区已播的三十三万亩春洋芋，都是选用早熟、高产、抗寒、抗病力强的优良品种。
    今年春洋芋由于播种面积扩大和实行密植，有些地区缺少种子。为了及时解决这一问题，各级党委都充分发动群众，在等价互利的原则下，开展协作，互相调剂。
