Xinhua News Agency, Bombay, 12th - The Chinese Consulate General in Bombay held a press conference this afternoon to issue a statement regarding the kidnapping of Zhang Qianyu, an employee of the Chinese Consulate General in Bombay, by personnel from the U.S. Consulate General in Bombay. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Statement of the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Bombay Regarding the Zhang Qianyu Incident
January 12, 1960

On November 26, 1959, Zhang Qianyu, an employee of this Consulate General, was suddenly kidnapped by personnel from the U.S. Consulate General in Bombay. After Zhang Qianyu managed to escape on the 27th, this Consulate briefly notified the Bombay City Police Bureau of the facts. The Chinese Embassy in India notified the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs twice on the 27th and 30th regarding this matter. The spokesman of the Information Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement on the 29th regarding this matter, lodging a serious protest with the United States. These notices and statements have made the nature and seriousness of the incident very clear. In order to cover up its crimes, the U.S. government has issued many contradictory and loophole-ridden statements, distorting the facts and slandering the Chinese government and this Consulate. In order to thoroughly expose this slander by the U.S. government and allow the people of the world to more clearly understand the despicable activities of the U.S. Consulate General in Bombay, this Consulate, based on Zhang Qianyu's own account and the actual situation, once again described the facts to the Deputy Commissioner of the Bombay Police Bureau on January 4, 1960. Zhang himself also went to the police bureau today to make a statement. The above situation is now issued as a statement as follows:

At approximately 11:00 AM on November 26, 1959, Zhang Qianyu went out on business and passed by the U.S. Consulate General in Bombay. Because a relative had asked him to inquire about how to apply for a visa to the United States, he took the opportunity to go into the U.S. Consulate to inquire. After the personnel of the U.S. Consulate General learned of Zhang Qianyu's purpose, they politely took him to a room upstairs, saying that they wanted to provide him with detailed information on this matter. After Zhang Qianyu went upstairs, the Americans boasted about how good the American way of life was, how free it was in the United States, and how the United States was working for the cause of freedom. They also hinted that they wanted Zhang Qianyu to cooperate with the Americans. Zhang Qianyu felt that the situation was a bit strange and wanted to leave, but the Americans told him to stay and said that they had not finished talking. Then, the Americans took him to another room and told him that cooperating with the United States was not a big deal. As long as he agreed to cooperate and completed a simple procedure, he could immediately return to the Chinese Consulate General and no one would know. He could get many benefits, and even if something happened, he could come to the U.S. Consulate General at any time, and they could send him to the United States. Zhang Qianyu became increasingly angry as he listened and stood up to leave. At this time, two Americans, one on each side, pressed him back into his seat, preventing him from escaping. The Americans said that he could not leave and then asked Zhang Qianyu to apply for "political asylum." Zhang Qianyu refused. The Americans told Zhang Qianyu that he had been at the U.S. Consulate for a long time, and even if he returned to the Chinese Consulate General, the Chinese would no longer trust him. Zhang Qianyu still refused, and the Americans became furious, threatening Zhang Qianyu that if he did not agree to their demands, his life would be in danger. Under extreme tension and fear, Zhang Qianyu thought to himself that if things continued like this, he would surely die. In order to escape, he had to agree to their demands first to gain their trust. In this way, Zhang Qianyu copied a statement applying for "political asylum" according to the draft they had prepared. Then, he completely recorded a so-called statement "condemning" China's "intelligence work" abroad according to the words dictated by the Americans and translated these statements into Chinese under duress. After doing all this, the Americans also wanted him to fabricate a set of words to tell them according to their intentions: First, he had to explain that he had voluntarily come to the U.S. Consulate to request "political asylum"; second, he had to explain that he had come to the U.S. Consulate after long-term planning; third, he had to explain that the reason he requested "political asylum" was that he was afraid of the anti-Rightist movement in China, felt unfree, and wanted to go to the United States because it was good. Zhang Qianyu said these words according to the Americans' requests, and the Americans recorded them.

That afternoon, the U.S. Consulate General sent a guard named Armstrong to take Zhang Qianyu to a beach in the suburbs of Bombay by car. When getting into the car, one of the Americans who had spoken to him in the morning made him wear sunglasses and lie down in the car, then covered him from head to toe with a blanket. When they arrived at the beach, Zhang Qianyu was locked in a house with the door locked. In the evening, the American who had made him wear sunglasses came to talk to Zhang Qianyu again, asking him about himself and various information about the Chinese Consulate General. The American wanted Zhang Qianyu to draw a diagram of the layout of the Chinese Consulate General, indicating the location of the Consul General's office, the location of the safe, and who lived in each room. The American also asked him what country the safe was made in and what the keyhole looked like. The American also wanted him to list the organizational and personnel arrangement system of the Chinese Consulate General and fill in detailed forms (five pages each) with pre-printed names called "Personnel Record Forms" with information on all personnel of the Chinese Consulate General, including the cook. At the same time, he was told that he must fill in the shape of each person's face and body clearly so that people could recognize who they were at a glance. The American wanted Zhang Qianyu to do a good job and told him that they were preparing to send him to Hong Kong or areas with a large number of overseas Chinese such as Malaya and Indonesia to carry out activities. Zhang Qianyu fabricated a set of things to perfunctorily meet the American's demands. When talking to Zhang Qianyu, the American recorded him again. The American looked like he was of medium height, with a pointed face, sunken eyes, high cheekbones, and a hooked nose. That day, he was wearing a white shirt and Indian slippers. After he finished talking to Zhang Qianyu, he left, leaving Armstrong to guard Zhang Qianyu.

At night, Zhang Qianyu lay in bed, thinking about how to escape from the clutches of the Americans. After Zhang Qianyu got up on the morning of the 27th, he saw a tape and "Personnel Record Forms" on the table. Zhang Qianyu made an excuse to go out for some fresh air. Armstrong opened the locks on the two doors and accompanied him on a walk at the door. Zhang Qianyu looked at the road at the door. After returning to the room, Zhang Qianyu found that Armstrong had not locked the door, but only put the chain on the first door. He felt that the opportunity to escape had arrived. Zhang Qianyu took the "Personnel Record Forms" and the tape and ran away while Armstrong was unprepared. However, he made a noise when taking off the chain on the door, alerting Armstrong, who chased after him. Zhang Qianyu ran and told Armstrong that an important safe key had been left in the U.S. Consulate and that he had to get it immediately, otherwise it would be difficult to find. Armstrong believed him and jumped on a passing truck with him, then changed to a taxi. When they were about to reach the U.S. Consulate, Zhang Qianyu saw an Indian he knew and waved him into the car, and whispered to him to go to the Chinese Consulate. The Indian said a word or two to the driver. When the car passed the U.S. Consulate, it did not stop. Armstrong became anxious and told the driver not to drive forward. Zhang Qianyu told him that there were many people here now, so it would be better to go around and then go in. The car continued to move forward, and when it reached a fork in the road, the Indian Zhang Qianyu knew had to get out of the car. Zhang Qianyu asked the Indian to continue to accompany him, and the Indian called another Indian on the side of the road to get in the car to accompany Zhang Qianyu. The car stopped at the gate of this Consulate General. Zhang Qianyu immediately asked the Indian to get out of the car and ring the bell of this Consulate, while he himself got out of the car in a hurry. At this time, Armstrong was very flustered and quickly pulled Zhang Qianyu with great force, refusing to let him go. Zhang Qianyu struggled and shouted repeatedly, "Someone is kidnapping me!" Personnel from this Consulate heard the sound and rushed out, rescued Zhang Qianyu, and grabbed Armstrong. This was around 7:00 AM on the 27th.

In order to hand Armstrong over to the police, personnel from this Consulate immediately called the Bombay Police Bureau after capturing Armstrong, reporting the incident four times. The fourth time was at around 8:30 AM, and it was a direct call to the Chief of the Bombay Police Bureau. At around 9:00 AM, Mr. Patil, the Deputy Commissioner of the Bombay Police Bureau, came to this Consulate. This Consulate immediately took the initiative to hand Armstrong over to the Indian side. Due to the need to understand the case and study the handling procedures of this case, Mr. Patil ended his conversation with personnel from this Consulate at around 1:00 PM and took Armstrong away.

This is the factual account of the U.S. Consulate General in Bombay kidnapping Zhang Qianyu, an employee of this Consulate, wanting him to act as a U.S. spy, forcing him to provide intelligence, and Zhang Qianyu's attempt to escape from the U.S. agency. These facts thoroughly expose the U.S.'s so-called "political asylum" for Zhang Qianyu and the slanderous accusation that this Consulate "kidnapped" Armstrong.

The fact that Zhang Qianyu went through all kinds of dangers and difficulties to escape back to this Consulate General refutes the fabrication that he went to the U.S. Consulate to seek "political asylum." If it were really a person seeking "political asylum," how could he immediately try his best to escape after he voluntarily wrote the so-called application for "political asylum" and a statement "condemning" his own government?

The fact that the U.S. Consulate General forced Zhang Qianyu to provide intelligence cannot be linked to the so-called "political asylum" in any way. May we ask, what does granting Zhang Qianyu "political asylum" have to do with understanding the various situations of the Chinese Consulate General, from the building to the people, to the safe, to the keyhole of the safe? This Consulate General has evidence of these despicable acts of the U.S. Consulate General, and the U.S. Consulate General cannot deny it no matter how hard it tries.

The Americans kidnapped Zhang Qianyu and therefore had him guarded by military personnel and secretly escorted him to a house on a beach in the suburbs and locked him up. The U.S. Consulate General in Bombay had a guilty conscience and deliberately said in its spokesman's statement on November 27 that Armstrong was a "clerk." They probably did not know at that time that the U.S. State Department's statement on the same day had already publicly identified Armstrong as a Marine Corps sergeant and "guard."

The two statements "written" by Zhang Qianyu at the U.S. Consulate General not only cannot prove that Zhang Qianyu voluntarily applied for "political asylum," but on the contrary, provide evidence of forced signing. Any Chinese can see at a glance that this foreign-flavored statement could not have been written by a Chinese person. The word PRIMA FACIE in the statement is something that even ordinary English-speaking Chinese people do not understand. However, the first draft of the statement issued by the U.S. State Department on November 27th definitely stated that Zhang Qianyu "voluntarily wrote a statement in Chinese and English." Presumably, they themselves felt that they could not justify themselves, so they immediately revoked this loophole-ridden first draft and issued a simple draft, no longer talking about Zhang Qianyu "voluntarily" writing the statement. In the first draft, they also had to admit that Zhang Qianyu went to the U.S. Consulate General to "inquire about visa information for entering the United States," but after this draft was revoked, all other statements insisted that Zhang Qianyu was seeking "political asylum" and no longer mentioned the fact that he was inquiring about visa procedures. Drafts can be revoked, but the flaws that have already been exposed can no longer be covered up.

The U.S. Consulate General in Bombay hijacked Zhang Qianyu, an employee of this Consulate, forced him to act as a U.S. spy, and forcibly detained Zhang Qianyu for as long as twenty hours from 11:00 AM on November 26th to 7:00 AM on the 27th, without notifying the Indian authorities during this period. This irrefutably proves that what the U.S. Consulate General did to Zhang Qianyu was an out-and-out kidnapping. The U.S. attempt to exonerate itself by saying that Zhang Qianyu was seeking "political asylum" is a complete fabrication. At the same time, the U.S. Consulate General seems to have forgotten that, according to international law and international practice, the consulate of any country has no right to grant "political asylum" to any foreign citizen.

Armstrong was the henchman who carried out the U.S. Consulate General's task of kidnapping Zhang Qianyu. He was so arrogant that when the car had already arrived in front of the Chinese Consulate General, he still tried to forcibly hold on to Zhang Qianyu, the victim, to prevent him from running back to this Consulate. It was completely legitimate for personnel from this Consulate to grab Armstrong in order to rescue Zhang Qianyu from Armstrong's powerful arms. This is an unquestionable act of self-defense. Why shouldn't such a lawless person be handed over to the police for legal action? The U.S. Consulate General's slander that personnel from this Consulate "kidnapped" Armstrong is not worth the laughter of informed people. May we ask, where in the world is there such a kidnapper who immediately reports to the police station after kidnapping someone and takes the initiative to hand the person over to the police to take away?

The U.S. Consulate General in Bombay's crime of kidnapping an employee of this Consulate cannot be erased. This behavior by the United States is an extreme contempt for the sovereignty and laws of the host country and a serious threat to the safety of personnel of the Chinese Consulate General. This shocking incident once again proves the U.S. government's policy of insisting on being hostile to the Chinese people and, for this reason, not hesitating to bring the Cold War to a third country. The Chinese Consulate General in Bombay strongly protests against this atrocity by the U.S. Consulate General and believes that the U.S. must bear full responsibility for this serious political conspiracy.

    我国驻孟买总领事馆发表声明揭穿美国政府的诽谤
    美国总领事馆绑架我职员的罪行无法洗刷
    强烈抗议美领事馆的暴行，美国必须对这一严重政治阴谋事件负全部责任
    新华社孟买12日电　中国驻印度孟买总领事馆今天下午举行记者招待会，就美国驻孟买总领事馆人员绑架中国驻孟买总领事馆职员张谦豫的事件发表声明。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国驻孟买总领事馆关于张谦豫事件的声明　　1960年1月12日
    1959年11月26日，本总领事馆职员张谦豫突遭美国驻孟买总领事馆人员绑架。27日张谦豫设法逃回后，本馆曾将事实经过扼要地通知了孟买市警察局。我国驻印度大使馆于27日和30日曾将此事两次通知了印度外交部。我国外交部新闻司发言人也在29日就此事发表了声明，对美国提出严重抗议。这些通知和声明已将事件的性质及其严重性说得非常清楚。美国政府为了掩饰自己的罪行，发表了许多前后矛盾、漏洞百出的声明，歪曲事实，对中国政府和本馆进行了诽谤。为了彻底揭穿美国政府的这种诽谤，使全世界人民更清楚地认识美国驻孟买总领事馆的卑污活动，本馆根据张谦豫本人的陈述和实际的情况，于1960年1月4日再次向孟买警局副局长叙述了事实经过，张本人也于今日去警局作出供述，现在再将上述情况发表声明如下：
    1959年11月26日上午十一时左右，张谦豫因事外出，路过美国驻孟买总领事馆，由于他的一位亲戚曾经托他打听如何办理去美国的签证手续，就趁便走进美国总领馆去打听。美国总领馆人员问明张谦豫的来意后，就客客气气地把他带到楼上的一间房子里，说是要向他详细介绍这方面的情况。张谦豫上了楼，美国人却向他吹嘘美国的生活方式如何好，在美国如何自由，美国如何为自由事业努力，并且暗示要张谦豫同美国人合作。张谦豫感觉到情况有点不对，想走，美国人留他说，不要忙，话还没有谈完。接着，美国人就把他带到另外一个房间，并且对他说，同美国合作并不是一件什么了不起的事情，只要他答应合作，办一个简单的手续，他可以马上回到中国总领馆去，任何人都不会知道，他可以得到很多好处，即便有什么事，随时可以到美国总领馆来，他们可以把他送到美国去。张谦豫越听越气，站起来想走，这时两个美国人，一边一个，硬把他按到座位上，使他脱身不得。美国人说，他是走不了的，接着就要张谦豫申请“政治庇护”。张谦豫不答应。美国人告诉张谦豫说，他来美国总领馆的时间已经很长，就是他再回到中国总领馆去，中国人也不会再相信他了。张谦豫还不答应，美国人就大发雷霆，威胁张谦豫说，如果再不答应他们的要求，他就有生命的危险。在极端的紧张和恐惧之下，张谦豫心里想，如果再这样下去是死定了；为了逃生，只有先答应他们的要求，骗取他们的信任。这样，张谦豫就按照他们拟好的稿子抄写了一份申请“政治庇护”的声明，然后他又完全按照美国人口授的话，录写了一个所谓“谴责”中国在国外进行“情报工作”的声明，并在美国人的强迫下，把这些声明译成中文。做完这些以后，美国人还要他按照他们的意图编造一套话讲给他们听：第一，要说明他是完全出于自愿到美领馆要求“政治庇护”的；第二，要说明他是经过长期谋划才到美领馆来的；第三，要说明他要求“政治庇护”的原因是怕中国反右倾运动，觉得不自由，因为美国好，所以要求到美国去等等。张谦豫按照美国人的要求说了这些话，美国人进行了录音。
    当天下午，美国总领事馆派卫士阿姆斯特朗用汽车把张谦豫押送到孟买市郊的海滩。上车时，上午同他谈过话的一个美国人让他戴上黑眼镜，躺在车里，然后用毯子把他连头带脚地盖上。到了海滩，张谦豫就被关在一幢屋子里，锁上了门。到了晚上，让他戴上黑眼镜的那个美国人又来同张谦豫谈话，问他本人和有关中国总领馆的各种情况。美国人要张谦豫画出中国总领馆房子的安排图形，注明总领事的办公处，保险柜的存放处，每间房间住的什么人。美国人还问他保险柜是哪国造的，钥匙孔的样子如何。美国人还要他列出中国总领馆的组织、人事安排系统表，并把包括厨子在内的中国总领馆全体人员的情况填写在已经印好的名字叫做“人物记录表”的详尽表格上（每份五页），同时还告诉他必须把每个人的脸型、体型填写清楚，使人一见到这些人就可以认出他们是谁来。美国人要张谦豫好好的干，并且告诉他说，他们准备把他派到香港或马来亚、印度尼西亚等华侨较多的地方进行活动。张谦豫编造了一套东西敷衍了美国人的要求。在同张谦豫谈话时，美国人又进行了录音。这个美国人的模样是中等身材，尖脸、陷眼、高颧骨、鹰钩鼻子，那天他穿的是白衬衫和印度拖鞋，他同张谦豫谈完了话就走了，留下阿姆斯特朗看守张谦豫。
    夜里张谦豫躺在床上，左思右想如何逃出美国人的魔掌。27日晨张谦豫起床后，看见桌上有录音带和“人物记录表”。张谦豫借口要出去呼吸新鲜空气，阿姆斯特朗把两道门的锁打开，陪他在门口散步。张谦豫在门口看了看路。回到屋子里以后，张谦豫发现阿姆斯特朗没有将门锁上，只是把第一道门的链子带上。他觉得逃跑的机会已经到了。张谦豫乘阿姆斯特朗不防备的时候，拿了“人物记录表”和录音带逃走，但是在取下门上的链带时发出声音，惊动了阿姆斯特朗，阿姆斯特朗就追了出来。张谦豫一面跑一面对阿姆斯特朗说，有一个重要的保险柜钥匙遗留在美国总领馆内，要马上去拿，迟了恐怕找不到。阿姆斯特朗信以为真，跟他一道跳上一辆过路的大卡车，以后又换乘出租汽车。快到美国总领馆时，张谦豫看见一个他熟悉的印度人，就招他上车，并且低声告诉他去中国总领馆，这个印度人便在司机耳边说了一两句。车子开过美国总领馆时没有停，阿姆斯特朗急了，叫司机不要向前开。张谦豫告诉他说，现在这里人多，绕个弯子再进去好。车子继续前进，开到三叉路口，张谦豫熟识的这个印度人因事要下车，张谦豫要求这个印度人继续陪他，这个印度人就叫了路旁另外一个印度人上车陪张谦豫。车开至本总领事馆门口停下，张谦豫立即请这个印度人下车按本馆电铃，同时自己急忙下车。此时阿姆斯特朗十分惊慌，赶快用大力拉住张谦豫不放。张谦豫一面挣扎，一面连声大叫“有人绑架”。本馆人员闻声赶出，救出张谦豫并且抓住阿姆斯特朗。这时是27日晨七时左右。
    为了将阿姆斯特朗交警察带走，本馆人员在抓到了阿姆斯特朗之后，立即打电话向孟买警察局报告，先后报警四次，第四次报警是在八时半左右，并且是直接打电话给孟买警察局局长。九时许，孟买警察局副局长帕第尔先生来本馆。本馆当即主动提出将阿姆斯特朗交给印方。由于了解案情和研究此案的处理手续等等问题，帕第尔先生至下午一时许才结束了与本馆人员的谈话，带走了阿姆斯特朗。
    这就是美国驻孟买总领馆绑架本馆职员张谦豫，要他充当美国间谍、强迫他提供情报和张谦豫设法逃出美国机关的事实经过。这些事实彻底揭穿了美国的所谓美国总领馆对张谦豫进行“政治庇护”和本馆“绑架”阿姆斯特朗的含血喷人的诬蔑。
    张谦豫历尽种种危险和困难逃回本馆的事实就拆穿了所谓他是去美国总领馆寻求“政治庇护”的捏造。如果真的是一个要求“政治庇护”的人，怎么可能当他自愿写了所谓申请“政治庇护”和“谴责”自己政府的声明以后，又立即千方百计地逃脱回来呢？
    美国总领馆逼迫张谦豫提供情报的事实无论如何也不能同所谓进行“政治庇护”联系起来。请问给予张谦豫“政治庇护”同了解中国总领馆的各种情况，从房子到人，到保险柜，到保险柜的钥匙孔究竟有什么关系呢？本馆掌握了美国总领馆这些卑污勾当的罪证，美国总领事馆要想抵赖也是抵赖不了的。
    美国人绑架了张谦豫，因而用军事人员看守着他，并且把他偷偷摸摸地押送到市郊海滩上一幢屋子里去锁起来。美国驻孟买总领馆作贼心虚，故意在11月27日它的发言人谈话中说阿姆斯特朗是“书记员”。他们那时大概还不知道同一天美国国务院的声明中已经公开了阿姆斯特朗是海军陆战队中士衔“卫士”的身分。
    张谦豫在美国总领馆所“写”的两个声明不仅不能证明张谦豫自愿申请“政治庇护”，相反恰恰提供了被迫签署的证据。任何中国人都可以一眼看出，这个洋味十足的声明绝不可能是出于中国人之手。声明中PRIMA FACIE一字更是一般的会说英语的中国人懂都不懂的。但是，美国国务院在11月27日的第一次发出的声明稿却肯定地说张谦豫“自愿用中文和英文写了一篇声明”。大概他们自己也感觉到不能自圆其说了，因此马上就撤销了这个漏洞百出的第一个声明稿，改发了一个简单的声明稿，不再谈什么张谦豫“自愿”写声明了。在第一个声明稿中，他们还不能不承认张谦豫到美国总领馆去是为了“询问关于进入美国的签证情况”，但是在这个声明稿被撤销以后，在所有其他的声明里却一口咬定张谦豫寻求“政治庇护”，再也不提关于询问签证手续的事实了。声明稿子可以撤销，但是已经露出来的破绽是再也掩盖不起来的。
    美国驻孟买总领馆劫持了本馆职员张谦豫，逼他充当美国的间谍，并且从11月26日上午十一时至27日晨七时强迫扣留张谦豫达二十小时之久，在此期间一直没有向印度当局作过任何通知。这就无可争辩地证明了美国总领馆对张谦豫所干的是不折不扣的绑架行为。美国企图以张谦豫寻求“政治庇护”来为自己开脱，这是彻头彻尾的捏造。同时，美国总领馆似乎忘记了，根据国际法和国际惯例，任何一个国家的领事馆无权对任何外国公民进行“政治庇护”。
    阿姆斯特朗是执行美国总领馆绑架张谦豫的任务的打手。他嚣张到这种程度，当汽车已经到了中国总领馆门前的时候，他还企图用强力拉住张谦豫这个受难者，阻止他跑回本馆。为了把张谦豫从阿姆斯特朗强有力的手臂中解救出来，本馆人员抓住阿姆斯特朗完全是正当的。这是一种无可非议的自卫行为。为什么不应当把这样一个无法无天的人交警法办呢？美国总领馆诬蔑本馆人员“绑架”阿姆斯特朗，这种指责不值识者一笑。请问天下哪里有这样一种绑架者，在绑架了一个人以后立即报告警察局，并且主动把这个人交给警察带走呢？
    美国驻孟买总领馆人员绑架本馆职员的罪行是无法洗刷的。美国这种行为是对驻在国主权和法律的极度蔑视，是对中国总领馆人员安全的严重威胁。这一骇人听闻的事件又一次证明了美国政府坚持与中国人民为敌的政策，并且为了这个原因，不惜把冷战带到第三个国家。中国驻孟买总领馆对美国总领馆的这种暴行提出强烈的抗议，并且认为美国必须对这一严重的政治阴谋事件负全部责任。
