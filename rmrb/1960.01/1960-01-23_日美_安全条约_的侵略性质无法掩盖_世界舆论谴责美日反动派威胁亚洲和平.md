Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 21st: The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published a commentary today stating that the U.S.-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" openly violates Japan's national interests, and it legitimizes turning Japan into an aggressive base for U.S. imperialism against Asian peace-loving countries.

The commentary pointed out that Japan's sovereignty cannot be seen at all in the newly signed U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. This treaty is full of gunpowder and may bring disaster to Japan, but nothing else.

The commentary said that if Japan hopes for a peaceful life and guarantees true independence, it should refuse to turn Japan into a U.S. military aggression base, should withdraw U.S. troops and rocket weapons from Japan, and should follow a neutral policy. The commentary said that this is the current demand of the Japanese people and all peace-loving people.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 21st: Bulgarian newspapers today published commentaries condemning Japan and the United States for signing a new "Security Treaty."

"Workers' Affairs" pointed out that the signing of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has created a dangerous situation in the Far East. This is absolutely inconsistent with the statements of U.S. leaders that they are committed to world peace.

The newspaper said that the signing of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" effectively made Japan a member of the U.S. military alliance and assumed the obligation to follow the U.S. foreign policy in international relations. It legitimizes the actual occupation of Japan by the U.S. military in the long term. This cannot but seriously undermine Japan's national sovereignty.

In terms of foreign relations, this treaty will seriously isolate Japan. Japan's interests require Japan to maintain good relations with its neighbors, the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. However, this treaty not only does not help in this regard, but will seriously hinder Japan's development of friendly relations with these countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, January 21st: The Romanian newspaper "Defense of the Fatherland" published a commentary today condemning the United States and Japan for signing an aggressive military treaty.

The commentary said that the purpose of the newly signed U.S.-Japan military treaty is to further revive Japanese militarism. The new military treaty not only maintains U.S. military bases in Japan, but also increases new military bases, while arming the Japanese army with various nuclear weapons, turning Japan into West Germany in the East. The commentary said that all mankind, especially the people of Asian countries, will not forget the crimes of Japanese militarists.

The commentary pointed out that the Japanese people's struggle against re-militarization and against the United States dragging Japan into its aggression plan in the entire Pacific and Far East is still continuing. The Japanese reactionary groups cannot hide the aggressive nature of this treaty in any way.

Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: Sydney News: The Australian Communist Party's newspaper "Tribune" said on the 20th: "All Australians must demand the abandonment of the U.S.-Japan 'Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security' signed in Washington this week."

The newspaper pointed out that just last week, a memorial meeting was held in Sydney to commemorate Australia's first battle with Japan in Malaya in 1942. The newspaper continued, "The forces we fought against that year have now returned under the armed forces of the dollar empire."

The newspaper paid tribute to the peace-loving people of Japan and said, "The Australian people should also stand at the forefront of opposing this treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 21st: The Indonesian "Eastern Star" published an editorial today criticizing the new U.S.-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" saying that this military treaty will make Japan a thorough U.S. military base.

The editorial said that for the people of Asian and African countries, this military treaty also shows that Japan will re-engage in its militaristic conspiracy, that is, to solve Japan's domestic difficulties through military expansion and to find markets and raw material producing areas abroad.

The editorial said: This military treaty will isolate Japan, first of all in Asian countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, January 22nd: The Iraqi "Voice of Free Men" published a commentary today saying that from the content of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," it is very obvious that this treaty is a threat to world peace, especially to the peace of the Far East. This treaty makes Japan a military base for aggression against the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The newspaper pointed out that after the signing of this new treaty, Japan will be further driven to satisfy the wishes of the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 21st: The UAR "Republic News" published an article today saying that there are many reasons to believe that the Japanese people will not tolerate the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and will eventually abolish this treaty.

The article said that this treaty makes Japan a U.S. ally completely standing with the West, and the new alliance is even more dangerous for Japan.

    日美“安全条约”的侵略性质无法掩盖
    世界舆论谴责美日反动派威胁亚洲和平
    据新华社地拉那21日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”今天发表评论说，日美“共同合作和安全条约”公开违背了日本的民族利益，它使把日本变成美国帝国主义反对亚洲爱好和平的国家的侵略基地这一点合法化。
    评论指出，从新签订的日美军事同盟条约中一点也看不到日本的主权。这个条约充满了火药气味，它可能给日本带来灾祸，而不会带来其他任何东西。
    评论说，日本如果希望和平的生活并保证真正的独立，就应当拒绝使日本变成美国的军事侵略基地，就应当使美国军队和火箭武器撤离日本，就应当遵循中立政策。评论说，这是日本人民和全体爱好和平的人民当前的要求。
    据新华社索非亚21日电　保加利亚报纸今天发表评论，谴责日本和美国签订新的“安全条约”。
    “工人事业报”指出，新日美“安全条约”的签订在远东造成了危险的局势。这是与美国领导人宣称他们致力于世界和平的言论绝对不相符合的。
    这家报纸说，新日美“安全条约”的签订使日本实际上加入了美国的军事同盟，并且承担了在国际关系方面追随美国外交政策的义务。它使美军在长期内对日本的实际占领合法化。这不能不严重地损害日本的民族主权。
    在对外关系方面，这个条约将使日本严重孤立。日本的利益要求日本首先与它的邻国苏联、中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国保持良好关系。但是，这个条约不仅在这方面无所裨益，而且将严重地障碍日本同这些国家发展友好关系。
    据新华社布加勒斯特21日电罗马尼亚“保卫祖国报”今天发表评论，谴责美国和日本签订侵略性的军事条约。
    评论说，美日新签订的军事条约的目的在于更进一步复活日本军国主义。新的军事条约不但保持美国在日本的军事基地，并且要增加新的军事基地，同时用各种核武器武装日本军队，变日本为东方的西德。评论说，全体人类，特别是亚洲各国人民是不会忘记日本军国主义者的罪行的。
    评论指出，日本人民反对重新军国主义化，反对美国把日本拖入它在整个太平洋和远东地区的侵略计划的斗争还在继续着。日本反动集团无论如何也无法掩盖这个条约的侵略性质的。
    据新华社21日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚共产党机关报“论坛报”20日说：“全体澳大利亚人必须要求废弃本周在华盛顿签订的日美‘共同合作和安全条约’”。
    报纸指出，刚刚在上星期，在悉尼举行了澳大利亚1942年在马来亚首次同日本开战的纪念会。报纸接着说，“我们当年与之作战的力量在美元帝国武装之下今天又卷土重来了”。
    这家报纸向爱好和平的日本人民致敬，并且说，“澳大利亚人民也应该站在反对这个条约的最前列。”
    据新华社雅加达21日电　印度尼西亚“东星报”今天发表社论抨击新的日美“共同合作和安全条约”说，这个军事条约将使日本成为彻头彻尾的美国军事基地。
    社论说，对亚非各国人民来说，这个军事条约也表明，日本将重新进行它的军国主义阴谋，即通过军事扩张来解决日本国内的困难，在国外寻找市场和原料产地。
    社论说：这个军事条约将使日本陷于孤立，首先在亚洲国家中孤立。
    新华社巴格达22日电　伊拉克“自由人之声报”今天发表的评论说，从新的日美“安全条约”的内容来看，十分明显，这个条约是对世界和平的威胁，特别是对远东和平的威胁。这个条约使日本成为对人民中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行侵略的军事基地。
    报纸指出，在签订这个新条约之后，日本将要进一步被驱使着以满足美国的愿望。
    据新华社开罗21日电　阿联“共和国报”今天发表文章说，有很多理由可以认为，日本人民不会容忍新的日美“安全条约”，最后总将废除这项条约。
    文章说，这个条约使日本成为完全同西方站在一起的美国的盟国，新联盟对日本更加危险。
