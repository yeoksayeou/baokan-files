Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 7th. The Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, in cooperation with the Changchun Locomotive Factory, successfully trial-produced the "Changchun 195 Type" diesel locomotive and the Jiefang brand railway vehicle. These are new products jointly manufactured by workers from the two factories in the first week of the new year.

The "Changchun 195 Type" diesel locomotive and Jiefang brand railway vehicle are both trial-produced to strengthen short-distance transportation and meet the current need for the large-scale construction of light railways in various regions. The design of the "Changchun 195 Type" diesel locomotive incorporates advanced Soviet technical achievements and is a relatively advanced light traction power vehicle for modern railways. In manufacturing, it uses assemblies such as the engine, gearbox, and drive shaft from heavy-duty trucks, as well as standard railway locomotive structural parts such as wheels, axles, axle boxes, suspension, and brakes. It also includes additional devices such as a transfer case for reversing and shifting directions. It has 95 horsepower and can haul 240 tons of goods, traveling at 25 kilometers per hour. On a 30‰ grade, it can haul 106 tons of goods, traveling at 6 kilometers per hour. This locomotive can use gasoline as fuel, or it can be equipped with a gas generator to use coal and wood as fuel.

The Jiefang brand railway vehicle is made by slightly modifying the Jiefang brand heavy-duty truck. Structurally, it is basically the same as the Jiefang brand truck, except that it uses cast steel wheels for the running gear, adds anti-skid equipment, and modifies the steering structure. This vehicle can haul 80 to 100 tons of goods on the tracks, traveling at 35 to 40 kilometers per hour. The advantage of this vehicle is that it can be restored to a Jiefang brand truck for use on highways.

    为土铁路制成“火车头”
    “长春一九五型”机车和解放牌铁道汽车诞生
    新华社长春7日电　长春第一汽车制造厂同长春机车厂协作试制成功了“长春一九五型”内燃机车和解放牌铁道汽车。这是两个工厂工人在新年第一周内共同制造的新产品。
    “长春一九五型”内燃机车和解放牌铁道汽车，都是为加强短途运输、适应当前各地大量修建轻便铁路的需要而试制的。“长春一九五型”内燃机车在设计上吸取了苏联先进技术成就，是现代铁路上比较先进的轻型牵引动力车；在制造上，采用了载重汽车的发动机、变速箱、传动轴等总成，以及铁道机车标准结构的车轮、车轴、轴箱、悬挂、制动等部件，并且增加了倒车、换向用的分动箱等装置。它有九十五马力，能牵引二百四十吨货物，每小时可以行驶二十五公里；在千分之三十的坡道上，能牵引一百零六吨货物，每小时可以行驶六公里。这种机车既可以用汽油作燃料，也可以安装煤气发生器，用煤炭、木柴作燃料。
    解放牌铁道汽车是由解放牌载重汽车稍加改造而制成的。在结构上，它跟解放牌汽车基本相同，只是在走行部分采用了铸钢车轮，增加了防滑设备，修改了转向结构。这种汽车在轨道上牵引八十吨到一百吨货物，每小时可以行驶三十五公里到四十公里。这种车的优点是，可以恢复为解放牌汽车，在公路上使用。
