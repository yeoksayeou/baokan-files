Bengbu, Anhui Province, achieved an all-round success in the first ten days of winter production. In these ten days, over 63 million cubic meters of water conservancy projects were completed, with an average daily labor efficiency of 33.6 cubic meters per person. Compared with the last ten days of last year, which had the highest efficiency, the daily progress increased by 86%, and the work efficiency nearly doubled. Following Xiao County, which completed its winter and spring water conservancy tasks by the end of last year, Suixi, Huaiyuan, and Lingbi counties have also overfulfilled their targets. The overall district task has been 99.2% completed. Manure accumulation also increased by 55% compared to the last ten days of last year. Various localities continued to implement the principle of accumulating and applying fertilizer simultaneously, with topdressing accounting for more than 60% of the district's summer crop area in ten days. As a result, the district's 20 million mu of summer crops have achieved the requirement of two applications of fertilizer twenty days ahead of schedule. Afforestation has developed rapidly, with the area of afforestation and tree planting in ten days exceeding 30% of the area afforested in the entire winter of last year. More than 230,000 mu of wasteland were reclaimed in ten days, an increase of 1.8 times compared with the last ten days of last year, and the district's annual wasteland reclamation task has now been overfulfilled by 22%. Significant achievements have also been made in diversified operations and spring plowing preparations.

The continued comprehensive reform of tools is an important reason for the all-round success of winter production in the Bengbu Prefecture. Over the past year, the district has reformed and promoted more than 10 million tools, and in the last ten days, it has reformed more than 300,000 tools. Most of the water control construction sites have an average of two or three advanced tools per person. Therefore, in the first ten days of this year, although 230,000 migrant workers were transferred from the district to strengthen other fronts, the efficiency of water control work still rose sharply. Various localities also attach great importance to tool reforms in other areas. In the past month alone, more than 960,000 tools for manure accumulation and topdressing have been reformed and promoted, and the work efficiency has generally increased by about three times.

At the same time, all localities pay close attention to improving labor organization and work methods. In Fengyang County, the afforestation task of 240,000 mu was originally the responsibility of 6,000 laborers. Because the number of people was small, the progress was not fast, and other aspects could not draw more manpower to support. Therefore, a combination of specialized teams and comprehensive assaults was adopted. The specialized teams first prepared for afforestation, and then launched a comprehensive mobilization to concentrate on assaults, which greatly accelerated the progress of afforestation. The annual task has been overfulfilled by 88% ten months ahead of schedule. In the Bayi Commune of Dingyuan County, there was a period of time when the timing of what work to do was not properly arranged. In the morning, the ground was frozen and slippery, which was suitable for transporting fertilizer, but some teams assigned commune members to plant trees; after thawing at noon, the road surface was muddy, but some teams assigned commune members to transport fertilizer. Later, it was changed to transporting fertilizer in the morning and evening, and topdressing and planting trees at noon, which significantly accelerated the progress of various productions.

This prefecture attaches great importance to the organic combination of various farm works. In addition to continuing to adopt the previously effective methods of combining water conservancy construction with tree planting, manure accumulation, and irrigation, various localities have created many new methods. Such as combining water conservancy construction with land improvement, road construction with afforestation, afforestation with repairing field drainage ditches and ridges, and so on. When Quanjiao County mobilized the masses to collect wild plants, the pits that had been dug were used to plant trees; if it was not suitable for planting trees, the soil was turned over for reclamation. In ten days, more than 2 million catties of kudzu roots were dug, 50,000 mu of wasteland were reclaimed, and 420,000 trees were planted.

A collaborative competition to help backward units catch up with advanced units has also been launched throughout the district. Through this competition, many backward units have quickly caught up with the help of advanced units, achieving an all-round leap forward. In the Yinji Commune of Lingbi County, most of the small teams had high work efficiency in water conservancy construction, but the work efficiency of 31 backward teams was low. The commune Party committee mobilized the advanced to help the backward, and the backward to catch up with the advanced. The Bolin Brigade spontaneously organized 15 red flag bearers to guide the backward teams on a tour. With their help, the work efficiency of many backward teams in water conservancy construction quickly rose from more than a dozen cubic meters to more than 30 cubic meters. Now, the work efficiency of this commune in water conservancy construction has increased from about 30 cubic meters in the past to more than 40 cubic meters. The progress of other productions has also been accelerated.

In realizing the good start in the first ten days of the new year, the Party committees at all levels in the Bengbu Prefecture have taken various active measures to strengthen leadership. In addition to going deep into the production site for specific inspection and specific assistance, large-scale inspections and evaluations were also organized. According to incomplete statistics, more than 8,000 inspection teams of various types were organized in the district, with more than 46,000 cadres at all levels participating in the inspection. Generally, they participated in labor while inspecting, and promptly solved problems when they were discovered.

    蚌埠专区上旬生产满堂红
    水利日工效高达三十三公方，积肥、造林等成绩显著
    本报讯　安徽蚌埠专区冬季生产实现新年第一旬全面满堂红。这十天修水利六万三千多万公方，每人日工效三十三点六公方，与去年工效最高的最后一旬相比，日进度加快86％，工效提高将近一倍。继萧县在去年年底完成冬春修水利任务后，又有濉溪、怀远、灵璧三县超额完成；全区任务也已完成99．2％。积肥也比去年最后一旬增加55％。各地继续贯彻边积边追的原则，十天追肥占全区午季作物面积的60％以上。至此，全区二千万亩午季作物已提前二十天实现普追两遍肥的要求。植树造林更是发展迅速，十天造林植树超过去年一个冬季造林面积的30％。十天开荒二十三万多亩，比去年最后一旬增加一点八倍，全区全年开荒任务现已超额22％完成。在多种经营、春耕准备等方面，也获得显著的成绩。
    继续全面改革工具，是蚌埠专区冬季生产满堂红的重要原因。一年来全区改革推广各种工具一千多万件，最近十天又改革各种工具三十多万件。大部分治水工地上都做到平均每人有两三种先进工具。所以，今年第一旬，全区治水民工虽抽调二十三万人加强其他战线，而治水工效仍然直线上升。其他各方面的工具改革，各地也极为重视。最近一月仅积肥追肥工具，就改革推广九十六万多件，工效一般都提高三倍左右。
    同时，各地十分注意改进劳动组织，改进干活方法。凤阳县二十四万亩造林任务，原来由六千个劳力负责营造，因为人数少，进度不快，而其他方面又不能抽出更多的人力支援。于是采取专业队与全面突击相结合，先由专业队做好造林准备，再全面发动，集中突击，大大加快了造林进度。全年任务已提前十个月超额88％完成。定远县八一公社，有一时期对什么时候干什么活在时间上安排不当，早晨地冻发滑适宜运肥，有些队却分配社员植树；中午解冻后路面烂泥多，有的队却又分配社员运肥。后来改为早晚运肥，中午追肥、植树，使各项生产进度显著加快。
    这个专区非常重视使各种农活有机结合。除了继续采用以往行之有效的兴修水利结合植树、积肥、灌溉等方法外，各地又创造了很多新方法。如兴修水利结合改田，筑路结合造林，造林结合整修田头排水沟畦，等等。全椒县在发动群众采集野生植物时，刨过的坑用来栽树；不宜栽树就翻土开荒。十天中刨葛根二百多万斤，开荒五万亩，植树四十二万多棵。
    全区各地还掀起了帮后进赶先进的协作竞赛热潮。通过这一竞赛，很多落后单位在先进单位帮助下，迅速赶上来，达到了全面跃进。灵璧县尹集公社在修水利中，绝大多数小队工效较高，但有三十一个落后队工效低。公社党委就发动先进帮落后，落后赶先进。波林大队自动组织十五个红旗手，到落后队巡回指导，经过他们帮助，很多落后队兴修水利工效很快由原来十几公方上升到三十多公方。现在这个社兴修水利工效已由过去的三十公方左右，提高到四十公方以上。其他各项生产进度也加快了。
    在实现新年第一旬开门红中，蚌埠专区各级党委采取了各种积极措施，加强领导。除深入生产现场具体检查、具体帮助外，又组织了大检查、大评比。据不完全统计，全区组织各种检查组八千多个，参加检查的各级干部四万六千多人，一般都做到边参加劳动边检查，发现问题及时解决。
