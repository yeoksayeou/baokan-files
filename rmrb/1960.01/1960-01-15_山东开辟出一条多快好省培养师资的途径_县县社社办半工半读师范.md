Shandong Opens Up a Way to Train Teachers More, Faster, Better, and More Economically
Counties and Communes Run Part-Work, Part-Study Normal Schools

The tasks of the part-work, part-study normal schools are: to train teachers for community-run primary schools, industrial and agricultural spare-time primary schools, and kindergartens. Schools generally have classes for primary school teachers, industrial and agricultural teachers, and kindergarten teachers. The schooling system is mostly two years or one year, and the kindergarten teacher class is four months to half a year. Most schools implement a system of four days of study, two days of labor, and one day of rest per week; kindergarten teacher classes have more study time.

(Our dispatch) Jinan, January 14 (Reporter Wang Jianlin) — Party committees and education administrative departments at all levels in Shandong Province have opened up a way to train teachers more, faster, better, and more economically: counties and communes are universally running part-work, part-study junior normal schools. Up to now, there are 78 county-run work-study normal schools in this province, with more than 13,400 students, and more than 9,700 have graduated on time or ahead of schedule; there are 206 commune-run work-study normal schools, with 10,900 students; nine counties, including Teng County, Rizhao, and Zhucheng, have also established county and commune spare-time normal schools, with more than 25,700 people participating in the study.

Work-study normal schools are junior normal professional schools run by the masses that implement part-work and part-study. Its current task is to train teachers for community-run primary schools, industrial and agricultural spare-time primary schools, and kindergartens. Local work-study normal schools generally have different types of classes, such as primary school teacher classes, industrial and agricultural teacher classes, and kindergarten teacher classes. The students are all progressive young men and women in the countryside who are recommended by the communes and selected by the schools through tests. They must be in good health, of suitable age, have a cultural level equivalent to graduation from higher primary school, and have undergone a certain amount of productive labor training. Based on the principle of combining popularization with improvement, and combining long-term training with short-term rotation training, the schooling system of these schools is mostly two years or one year, and the kindergarten teacher class is four months to half a year. The curriculum includes seven or eight courses such as political courses, cultural courses, and professional courses, with twenty-four to twenty-six class periods per week. The arrangement of teaching and productive labor time follows the principle of part-work and part-study, and most implement a system of four days of study, two days of labor, and one day of rest per week. Because the kindergarten teacher class has a shorter study time, they have more study time.

Work-study normal schools can train more and faster the large number of teachers currently needed for community-run education and spare-time education. For example, in the past year, the 11 county-run work-study normal schools in Changwei Prefecture were more than double the number of full-time normal schools held in the past ten years; more than 2,300 teachers of various types have been trained, which is equivalent to more than three times the number of full-time normal school graduates last year. The Shandong Provincial Department of Education calculated that after the further development of community-run education and industrial and agricultural spare-time education this year, a total of 250,000 teachers of various types are needed, while only 11,000 students graduate from various intermediate normal schools, which is a big difference. Now there is already this reliable way of work-study normal schools.

In terms of teaching, work-study normal schools implement a method of combining classroom teaching with practical business practice, so the students trained not only have book knowledge, but also have practical production skills and business capabilities, and can closely connect with the masses. Using the same grade test questions as a full-time middle school, the students of the Lincheng Commune-run work-study normal school in Teng County achieved an average score of more than 73 points. After the teachers trained in this way arrive at their work posts, they naturally become resolute implementers of the Party's education policy and have made outstanding achievements in teaching. According to a detailed investigation by the Gaomi County Education Bureau, among the 61 graduates of the Gaomi County Work-Study Normal School, among the three teachers serving in the senior classes of community-run primary schools, two have caught up with the teaching level of the senior classes of public primary schools; among the 58 teachers serving in the junior classes, 43 have caught up with or surpassed the teaching level of public primary schools. Now many graduates of work-study normal schools have become substitute teachers in public primary schools, senior class teachers, community-run primary school cadres, and model workers. They care about production, actively participate in central work, and are warmly loved by the masses.

Work-study normal schools also greatly save the country's expenses and the burden on students' families. For example, the 11 work-study normal schools in Changwei Prefecture have trained more than 2,300 teachers in the past year, and the state has only subsidized 170,000 yuan for infrastructure construction and teacher salaries; if 11 full-time normal schools were opened, calculated with the same number of students, the state would need to spend 900,000 yuan in one year. Now, many work-study normal schools have production bases, and production has greatly developed under the principle of focusing on agriculture and sideline occupations and high-yield cash crops. In just over a year, the school's various expenses have reached self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency. The Shouguang County Work-Study Normal School not only mobilized teachers and students to work hard and practice frugality, building more than 60 high-quality school buildings, but also built its own farm, breeding farm, and small factory. In the past year, the school's various income reached 25,000 yuan, in addition to solving all the students' food expenses and purchasing more than 4,700 yuan of production tools and other equipment, it also accumulated 3,000 yuan. With the development of self-sufficiency in production of work-study normal schools, the state's subsidies to it will gradually decrease in the future, or no subsidies will be needed at all.

The work-study normal schools in various parts of Shandong are flexible and diverse in their forms of running schools. It can be set up independently or attached; it can have only one or two classes, or it can have primary school classes, worker-peasant classes, kindergarten teacher classes, etc.; it can be run by counties, communes, industrial and mining enterprises, or it can combine long-term training with short-term rotation training; it can be part-work and part-study, or it can be spare-time. For example, Teng County has developed from county, commune, and industrial and mining enterprises running work-study normal schools to running spare-time normal schools on a large scale. There are already 265 commune-run and factory-mine-run spare-time normal schools in this county, with more than 3,600 students. The larger the scope of running normal schools, the more it can meet the needs of the development of community-run education and industrial and agricultural spare-time education.

As soon as the work-study normal school appeared, it immediately received the care and support of party committees and the people at all levels. The county party committees and many commune party committees have included running work-study normal schools well on the agenda, allocating cadres and teachers to it, and solving problems such as funds, equipment, and production bases. Some county party committee members and commune party committee secretaries also personally serve as principals of work-study normal schools. The broad masses of commune members also consciously and voluntarily help work-study normal schools solve difficulties such as school buildings, teaching aids, and production tools, and mobilize their children to enroll. People praise work-study normal schools as schools that cadres, the masses, teachers, parents, and students "all like."

    山东开辟出一条多快好省培养师资的途径
    县县社社办半工半读师范
    半工半读师范的任务是：培养民办小学、工农业余小学和幼儿园的教师。学校一般都设有小学师资、工农师资、幼儿师资等班级。学制多为二年制或一年制，幼儿师资班是四个月到半年。多数学校实行每周四天学习、两天劳动、一天休息的制度；幼儿师资班读书的时间更多一些。
    本报讯　记者王建林报道：山东省各级党委和教育行政部门，开辟出一条多快好省地培养师资的途径：县社普遍举办半工半读的初级师范学校。到目前为止，这个省的县办工读师范已达七十八处，在校学生一万三千四百多人，按期或提前毕业九千七百多人；社办工读师范二百零六处，在校学生一万零九百多人；滕县、日照、诸城等九县，还举办了县、社业余师范，有二万五千七百多人参加学习。
    工读师范，是群众举办的、实行半工半读的初级师范专业学校。它目前的任务是，培养民办小学、工农业余小学和幼儿园的教师。各地工读师范，一般都设有小学师资、工农师资、幼儿师资等不同类型的班级。学生都是由公社保送和学校经过测验选拔的思想进步、身体健康、年龄相当、具有高小毕业文化水平，并且经过一定生产劳动锻炼的在乡男女青年。根据普及与提高相结合，长期培养与短期轮训相结合的原则，这些学校的学制多数为二年制或一年制，幼儿师资班是四个月到半年。课程有政治课、文化课、专业课等七、八门，每周授课二十四到二十六节不等。教学和生产劳动时间的安排，依照半工半读的原则，多数实行每周四天学习、两天劳动、一天休息的制度。幼师班因为学习时间较短，读书的时间就更多些。
    工读师范可以更多更快地培养当前民办教育和业余教育所需要的大量师资。如昌潍专区一年来的县办工读师范有十一处，为十年来举办全日制师范学校的一倍以上；培养各类教师二千三百多人，等于去年全日制师范毕业生人数的三倍以上。山东省教育厅算了一笔账，今年民办教育和工农业余教育进一步发展以后，共需各类教师二十五万人，而各类中级师范毕业的学生只有一万一千人，相差很多。现在已经有了工读师范这个可靠的门路。
    在教学方面，工读师范实行课堂讲授与业务实习相结合的方法，所以培养出来的学生既有书本知识，又有实际生产技能和业务能力，并且能够密切联系群众。滕县临城社办工读师范用全日制中学同年级试题测验，学生成绩平均达到七十三分多。这样培养出来的教师到达工作岗位以后，都很自然地成了党的教育方针的坚决执行者，在教学工作中做出了优异的成绩。高密县工读师范的六十一名毕业生，经县教育局详细调查，在担任社办小学高级班的三名教师中，有两人赶上了公办小学高级班的教学水平；在担任初级班的五十八名教师中，有四十三人赶上或超过了公办小学的教学水平。现在很多工读师范的毕业生，成了公办小学的代课教师、高级班教师、民办小学干部和模范工作者。他们关心生产、积极参加中心工作，受到群众热烈爱戴。
    工读师范还大大节省了国家的开支和学生家庭的负担。如昌潍专区十一处工读师范，一年来培养出二千三百多名教师，国家仅补助基建费和教师工资等十七万元；如果开办十一处全日制师范学校，按同样多的学生计算，一年内就需国家拿出九十万元。现在，许多工读师范都有生产基地，在以农副业为主、高产经济作物为主的方针下，生产有了很大发展。仅一年多的功夫，学校各种经费就达到了自给或半自给。寿光县工读师范，不仅师生动手，勤俭办学，建起了六十多间质量很好的校舍，而且自建了农场、饲养场、小工厂。一年来，这所学校的各项收入达二万五千元，除解决学生的全部伙食费用和购置了四千七百多元的生产工具和其他设备外，还积累三千元。随着工读师范生产自给的发展，今后国家对它的补助还会逐步减少，或根本不用补助。
    山东各地的工读师范在办学形式上，是灵活多样的。它可以单设，也可以附设；可以只设一两个班，也可以小学班、工农班、幼师班等一应俱全；可以县、社、工矿企业举办，也可以长期培养与短期轮训结合；可以半工半读，也可以是业余性的。如滕县已由县、社、工矿企业举办工读师范，发展到大办业余师范。这个县已有社办、厂矿办业余师范二百六十五处，在校学生三千六百多人。办师范的范围越大，越能适应民办教育和工农业余教育发展的需要。
    工读师范一出现，就立即得到了各级党委和人民群众的关怀与支持。各县县委和很多公社党委都把办好工读师范列入议事日程，给它调配干部、师资，解决经费、设备和生产基地问题。有些县委委员和公社党委书记还亲自担任工读师范的校长。广大社员群众也都自觉自愿地帮助工读师范解决校舍、教具和生产工具等困难，动员子女入学。人们称赞工读师范，是干部、群众、教师、家长、学生“五喜欢”的学校。
