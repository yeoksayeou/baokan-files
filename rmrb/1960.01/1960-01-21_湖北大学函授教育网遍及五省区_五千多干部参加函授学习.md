Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 20th—Hubei University's higher correspondence education network has spread across many government agencies, industrial and mining enterprises, and people's communes in the five provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Henan, and Guangxi. Currently, over five thousand one hundred cadres from political and legal and financial and economic departments are engaged in correspondence studies in eight majors at Hubei University, including industrial economics, agricultural economics, trade economics, finance and credit, industrial accounting, industrial statistics, and law, integrating their studies with their respective work.

Studying the major related to their work is the fundamental key to the consolidation and development of Hubei University's correspondence education. The correspondence students' chosen majors align with the nature of their work, creating mutual promotion between study and application. Furthermore, these correspondence students are the backbone of their work units, possess relatively high political awareness, and have practical work experience, enhancing their comprehension of the curriculum. Consequently, the quality of learning continuously improves. Over the years, the average examination scores of Hubei University's correspondence students have reached good or excellent for over 60% of the total number, with over 30% passing and less than 10% failing. Many correspondence students, due to their improved theoretical levels, have been designated by their units as instructors or teachers for political and professional studies within the organization, becoming capable assistants to their leaders. Correspondence study has universally enhanced the analytical and judgmental abilities of cadres. They apply the theories they have learned to study practical work, contributing more to their actual work. Guo Xinan, who studies finance and credit, combines his banking work, study, and writing. In the past year or so, he has written more than twenty pieces of work research and study insights with situations and analysis, such as "The Development Law of Savings Work in the Past Ten Years" and "Outline of Commune Savings Propaganda," which have been valued by leaders.

Hubei University, on the one hand, compiles textbooks and study method guides according to the teaching plan, promptly guiding correspondence students in their studies. On the other hand, it draws twenty capable teachers and forty full-time counseling cadres to form a specialized team to strengthen the teaching work. In addition to the full-time counseling cadres forming counseling stations in various places for daily tutoring of students, it also closely grasps the teaching link of face-to-face instruction on the basis of correspondence. According to the teaching plan of each chapter, it organizes teachers to go deep into the correspondence students' units to understand the experience and problems of actual work, collect materials, and combine them with textbooks to explain key and difficult problems thoroughly. For some students who are too scattered to be able to be concentrated for face-to-face instruction, lectures are given in writing or by playing lecture recordings. This method of lecturing, which combines theory and practice and highlights key points, enables face-to-face instruction to achieve the important role of inspiring and guiding students' self-study, strengthening students' independent thinking ability, and achieving great results. Coupled with the vigorous guidance of the counseling stations and a certain amount of group discussions, the students' interest in studying is growing, and the school's prescribed regular assignments and course exams can generally be completed on schedule.

The reason why Hubei University's correspondence education is so successful is inseparable from the cooperation between various units and Hubei University. The school and various units regard correspondence education as a common task to cultivate and improve cadres. Party organizations in various places regard cadres' correspondence education as an important measure to realize the "Red and Expert" (politically Red and professionally expert) plan, closely grasp the political and ideological education of correspondence students, and regularly supervise and inspect their studies. In terms of time, in addition to ensuring that cadres have spare time for self-study and listening to lectures, the units also arrange review time for correspondence students during the examination period. Due to the care and attention of Party organizations in various places, the learning enthusiasm of many cadres has been high. They give full play to the spirit of seizing every opportunity, adopting methods of learning less when busy, learning more when less busy, or cramming, using early rising, late sleeping, rest time, or scattered time such as traveling by car or boat to read and do homework, accumulating bit by bit, to ensure the quality of learning.

    湖北大学函授教育网遍及五省区
    五千多干部参加函授学习
    新华社武汉20日电　湖北大学的高等函授教育网已经撒遍湖北、湖南、广东、河南、广西五个省区的许多机关、工矿企业和人民公社。目前有五千一百多政法财经部门干部，结合各自的工作，分别在湖北大学的工业经济、农业经济、贸易经济、财政与信贷、工业会计、工业统计和法律等八个专业进行函授学习。
    做什么工作就学什么专业，这是湖北大学函授教育得以巩固发展的根本环节。函授生所学专业和自己的工作性质一致，学用互相推动，加上这批函授生都是工作岗位上的骨干力量，政治水平较高，又有实际工作经验，对课程的理解力强，体会深，因此学习质量不断提高。历年来，湖北大学函授生的各专业课程的考试成绩，达到优良的平均占总人数60％以上，30％以上的人及格，不及格的不到10％。很多函授生由于理论水平提高了，被所在单位指定为机关政治学习、业务学习的辅导员或教员，成为领导上的得力助手。函授学习普遍增强了干部的分析能力和判断能力，他们运用学到的理论，研究实际工作，对实际工作贡献更多。学习财政与信贷专业的过锡南，把银行工作、学习、写作结合在一起，一年多来写了二十多篇有情况有分析的工作研究和学习心得，如“十年来储蓄工作的发展规律”，“公社储蓄宣传提纲”等，受到领导上的重视。
    湖北大学一方面根据教学计划编选教材和学习方法指导书，及时指导函授生学习，同时抽调二十名得力教师和四十名专职辅导干部组成专门班子，加强教学工作。除了专职辅导干部在各地组成辅导站日常辅导学员学习以外，在函授的基础上还紧紧抓住面授这个教学环节，按照各章节的教学计划，组织教师深入函授生所在单位，了解实际工作的经验和问题，收集资料，结合教材，对重点和难解的问题讲深讲透。对一些过于分散无法集中面授的学员，就用书面讲授或放讲课录音的办法进行讲课。这种理论与实际相结合、重点突出的讲课办法，使面授达到了启发、诱导学员自学的重要作用，加强了学员独立思考能力，收效很大。加上辅导站的大力辅导和一定的小组讨论，学员们钻研兴趣越来越大，学校规定的定期作业和课程考试一般都能按期完成。
    湖北大学函授教育所以办得好，是各单位同湖北大学协作分不开的。学校和各单位都把函授教育当作培养提高干部的共同任务。各地党组织都把干部的函授教育当作实现红专规划的重要措施，抓紧对函授生的政治思想教育，经常监督检查他们的学习。在时间上，各单位除了保证干部业余自学和听课时间以外，在考试期间还给函授生安排了复习时间。由于各地党组织的关怀和重视，很多干部的学习情绪一直饱满，他们发挥见缝就插的干劲，采取大忙少学、小忙多学或突击学的办法，利用早起、晚睡、休息时间或出差搭车乘船等零散时间读书作业，积少成多，保证了学习质量。
