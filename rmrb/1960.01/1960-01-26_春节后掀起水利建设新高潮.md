Ushering in a New Upsurge in Water Conservancy Construction After the Spring Festival
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

	On the millions of water conservancy construction sites across our country, it is bustling with activity everywhere, and the 70 million-strong water conservancy army is full of vigor. Strong winds and heavy snow, hard ice and frozen soil, cannot stop the great leap forward in water conservancy projects. In order to complete the projects early and benefit early, to welcome the first spring plowing of the 1960s, and to realize the grand ideal of water conservancy and electrification as soon as possible, millions of people will remain on the construction sites during the Spring Festival, celebrating the festival while persevering in the battle; after the Spring Festival, a greater upsurge in water conservancy construction will be launched immediately.

	All comrades on the water conservancy front have fought hard throughout the winter and have already created brilliant achievements. Preliminary statistics from October last year to January 22 this year show that a total of more than 3.8 million water conservancy and soil conservation projects have been started nationwide, of which more than 3.1 million have been successfully completed; the irrigated area has been expanded and improved by 200 million mu, and the area of soil and water conservation is 156,000 square kilometers. In more than three months, a total of more than 19 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work has been completed, which is more than the amount completed during the same period in the winter of 1957, the year of the special great leap forward in water conservancy construction. In particular, the achievements of large and medium-sized key projects have greatly exceeded those of previous years: a total of more than 270 large reservoirs with a storage capacity of over 100 million cubic meters are under construction, which is three times more than the total number of large reservoirs built in the ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China; more than 2,700 medium-sized projects have been started, which is 60% more than the total number completed in the previous ten years. Tool reforms on water conservancy construction sites are changing with each passing day, and work efficiency is rising linearly. The average daily work efficiency per person on construction sites across the country has increased from 1.5 cubic meters at the beginning of the winter last year to about 4 cubic meters. They have brought into play the spirit of self-reliance, fundamentally overcome the difficulties of insufficient equipment and technical strength, effectively guaranteed the quality of projects, and significantly reduced project costs. According to inspections, more than 90% of the new projects built last winter meet the specifications. Many regions have vigorously promoted river networking and the systematization of water conservancy projects, and have initially formed relatively complete water conservancy systems. The 70 million people have once again proved with their actions that China's socialist construction can not only achieve a great leap forward every year, but also leap forward better and more comprehensively year by year, and once again proved the correctness of the Party's general line and the power of the people's communes.

	The people of the whole country are also directly or indirectly supporting water conservancy construction with the achievements of the new great leap forward. In order to enable the water conservancy army to have a good Spring Festival on the construction sites, all localities have done a good job in transferring and supplying grain, non-staple food and other materials needed on the construction sites before and after the Spring Festival, and have generally organized mass cultural and recreational activities and consolation performances to ensure that the Spring Festival on the construction sites is better, more lively and more joyful than at home. The leadership should cherish the enthusiasm of the migrant workers who stay on the construction sites during the Spring Festival and should also be particularly concerned about their lives. For migrant workers who must return home during the Spring Festival for various reasons, it is also necessary to do a good job in organizing and mobilizing them, and to ensure that the original team returns to the construction site on time as much as possible in order to maintain a more skilled team. If a change of shifts is necessary for various reasons, it is also necessary to do a good job in organization, making sure that all aspects are clearly explained, so as not to affect work order, work efficiency and work quality. During this period, special attention should be paid to assigning specific personnel to take charge of the custody and use of various tools, both public and personal, which is also an important link in ensuring work efficiency. In short, it is necessary to achieve: a good Spring Festival, greater enthusiasm, and a new upsurge after the festival!

	After the Spring Festival, the busy farming season will soon arrive; spring plowing preparation work requires people and water. At the same time, the peach blossom flood is about to come, and flood control work also requires the acceleration of water conservancy projects. The water conservancy front has already made great achievements since last winter, but the tasks ahead are still arduous. Some of the projects started last year have not yet been completed, and many of the uncompleted projects are relatively difficult large and medium-sized projects. There are also many projects that have not been fully equipped, and some items have been completed, but some items are still lacking, so they still cannot play a role. Therefore, as soon as the Spring Festival is over, it is necessary to seize the one to two months before the spring plowing and busy farming season and create greater achievements on the water conservancy front. Efforts should be made to complete 80%-90% of the annual water conservancy tasks in the winter and spring seasons, and to ensure that the vast majority of projects can control floods before the flood season and play a role in spring agricultural production. For projects that can be completed and benefited this spring, it is necessary to concentrate efforts to make a breakthrough in completing the supporting facilities as soon as possible, and to closely connect and comprehensively arrange everything from water source projects to water transmission projects and field projects, so as to achieve the completion of reservoirs and channels, water to the leveled land, wells and tools, and a complete package. It is necessary to achieve: repair one place and accept one place; use it immediately after repair; persist from beginning to end, and leave as little as possible or no unfinished work at all.

	After the Spring Festival, special attention should also be paid to key projects, namely large and medium-sized projects. These projects undertake particularly important tasks in irrigation and flood control, and are all built on relatively large rivers; completing them one day earlier will allow them to play a huge role one day earlier; if they cannot be completed before the flood season, the flood control burden will be increased. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between the importance and urgency of these projects, implement the construction plans item by item, and appropriately concentrate labor, equipment and leading personnel under the principle of combining large, medium and small projects, and strive to complete them before the flood season. This year, a large number of new projects have not yet been tested by floods, especially thousands of large and medium-sized reservoirs that can store millions, tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions of cubic meters of water. To ensure that there are no accidents during the flood season, it is necessary to immediately start preparing for flood control.

	The season for spring irrigation and rice transplanting is coming soon. The large number of projects that have been completed should be immediately managed and used well. The organizations and systems for water management and water use should be established as soon as possible. For those that already have certain organizations and systems in the past, it is necessary to improve the organizations and systems one step further according to the new situation of further expanding and improving water conservancy projects, according to the new requirements of further comprehensively and meticulously implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and according to the overall plan for further developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations and fisheries and community-run industries, so that it is more scientific and more complete, and achieve multi-purpose water use with irrigation as the main focus.

	According to meteorological forecasts, cooling and frost may occur in northern regions before and after the Spring Festival, so it is even more necessary to seize the opportunity to carry out spring irrigation, prevent drought and frost, and ensure that wheat passes the greening stage well. The land for spring sowing should also be watered before sowing as early as possible, so as to cultivate and harrow early and sow in a timely manner. For all water storage projects, it is necessary to find ways to increase water sources, and timely intercept and store spring rain, and strive to keep the reservoirs full and the ponds saturated, so that not a drop of water is lost, and prepare abundant water sources for early rice and summer crops.

	The workers on the industrial front actively support agriculture and have produced many irrigation and drainage machines and electrical equipment, which are being transferred to rural areas recently; water conservancy, commercial, industrial, transportation and other departments in various localities should cooperate closely to ensure that these equipment can be installed and put into production in a timely manner. Rural hydropower stations that have completed the water conservancy part but the electromechanical equipment cannot be transported in a short period of time should first use hydropower to process grain and cotton, etc., and should not let the water flow away in vain while waiting for the machines. For the pumping power machinery that was transferred to water conservancy construction sites last winter, it is necessary to do a good job in inspection and return to the team as soon as possible before the arrival of the spring irrigation and rice transplanting season; if some of them really cannot be transferred back to their original locations, arrangements should be made as early as possible to avoid delaying agricultural work.

	The new spring is about to arrive, and many glorious and urgent tasks are placed before all comrades on the water conservancy front. Since last winter, water conservancy construction has been advancing rapidly, and the situation is very good. Henan, Gansu, Hunan, Guangdong, Anhui and other provinces have successively completed and overfulfilled their original annual plans ahead of schedule. Areas with relatively slow progress should quickly strengthen leadership and learn from advanced areas. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, the tens of millions of water conservancy troops will persistently work hard and cleverly, and the national water conservancy construction tasks in 1960 will certainly be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule. We wish the new spring will bring new and great victories on the water conservancy front!

    春节后掀起水利建设新高潮
    本报评论员
    在我国的几百万处水利工地上处处热气腾腾，七千万水利大军个个干劲冲天。大风大雪，坚冰冻土，都阻止不了水利工程的跃进。为了早完工早受益，为了迎接六十年代的第一次春耕，为了早日实现水利化、电气化的宏伟理想，千百万人春节期间仍将留在工地，一面欢度佳节，一面坚持战斗；过了春节，就要立即掀起一个更大的水利建设高潮。
    水利战线上的全体同志们奋战一冬，已经创造了辉煌的成就。从去年10月到今年1月22日初步统计，全国开工的各项水利和水土保持工程共计三百八十多万处，其中三百一十多万处已经胜利完工；扩大和改善灌溉面积二亿亩，水土保持面积十五万六千平方公里。三个多月，总共完成了一百九十多亿土石方的工作量，比水利建设特大跃进的1957年冬季同时期完成的数量还要多。特别是大中型骨干工程，成就大大超过往年：正在施工的蓄水一亿立方米以上的大型水库共计二百七十多座，比建国十年来建成的大型水库的总数还多三倍；已经开工的中型工程共计二千七百多处，比前十年完成的总数还多60％。水利工地上的工具改革日新月异，工作效率直线上升，全国各工地每人每天的平均工效已经由去年冬季刚开工时的一点五立方米提高到四立方米左右。他们发挥自力更生的精神，从根本上克服了器材和技术力量不足的困难，切实地保证了工程质量，显著地降低了工程成本。据检查，去冬新修工程90％以上合乎规格要求。很多地区大搞河网化和水利工程系统化，已经初步形成了比较完整的水利系统。七千万人以自己的行动，再一次证明我国的社会主义建设不但可以年年大跃进，而且一年比一年跃进得更好更全面，再一次证明了党的总路线的正确和人民公社的威力。
    全国人民同样在以新的大跃进的成就直接或间接地支援水利建设。为了使水利大军在工地上过好春节，各地都对春节前后工地上需要的粮食、副食品和其它物资，做好了调运和供应工作，并且普遍组织群众性的文化娱乐活动和慰问演出，保证在工地上过春节比在家里更好、更热闹、更欢乐。对于留在工地上过春节的民工，领导方面对他们的热情应当十分珍重，同时对他们的生活应当分外关心。对于在春节期间由于种种原因必须回家的民工，也要做好组织动员工作，尽可能做到原班人马按时返回工地，以便保持比较熟练的队伍。由于种种原因必须换班的，也必须做好组织工作，各方面都交代清楚，做到不影响工作秩序、工作效率和工作质量。在这期间，对于公用的和个人用的各种工具，特别要注意分配专人专责保管和使用，这也是保证工作效率的重要一环。总之，要做到：春节过得好，干劲更加高，节后掀起新高潮！
    过了春节，很快就要到农忙季节了；春耕准备工作需要人，也需要水。同时桃汛即将到来，防汛工作也要求水利工程加快进行。去冬以来水利战线上已经有了很大成就，但是摆在面前的任务仍很艰巨。去年开工的工程，有一部分还没有完工，而且未完工的很多是比较艰巨的大中型工程。还有不少工程没有配好套，完成了一些项目，还缺少一些项目，仍然不能发挥作用。因此，春节一过，就要抓紧春耕农忙前的一个月到两个多月的时间，在水利战线上创造更大的成就。要力争在冬春季节完成全年水利任务的80％—90％，力争绝大部分工程能在汛前拦洪，能在春季农业生产中发挥作用。对今春可以完工受益的工程，一定要集中力量，尽先突击配套，从水源工程到输水工程、田间工程，紧密衔接，全面安排，做到库成渠通，水到地平，有井有具，一气呵成。要做到：修好一处，验收一处；修好之后，立即使用；坚持始终，少留最好不留尾工。
    春节过后，还要特别注意骨干工程，即大中型工程。这些工程在灌溉和防洪中担当着特别重要的任务，而且又都修建在比较大的河流上；提早完成一天，就能早一天发挥巨大的作用；如果不能在汛前完成，就要加重防洪负担。因此，应当分别轻重缓急，使这些工程的修建计划项项落实，在大中小工程相结合的原则下，适当地集中劳动力、器材和领导骨干，力争在汛前完工。今年有很大一批新工程还没有经过洪水考验，特别是几千座能蓄水几百万方、几千万方以至几亿方的大中型水库，要确保汛期不出险，就必须立即下手做好防汛准备工作。
    春灌和插秧用水季节很快就要来到了。已经完成的大批工程，应当立即管好用好。管水用水的组织、制度都要赶快建立起来。过去已经有一定的组织和制度的，要按照水利工程进一步扩大和改善的新情况，按照进一步全面地细致地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的新要求，按照进一步发展农林牧副渔和社办工业的总规划，把组织和制度提高一步，使它更科学、更完备，做到以灌溉为纲，一水多用。
    根据气象预报，春节前后，北方地区可能发生降温霜冻现象，更要抓紧时机开展春灌，防旱防冻，保证小麦过好返青关。春播地也要早浇播前水，以便提早耕耙，适时播种。对所有的蓄水工程，都要千方百计地增辟水源，及时地拦蓄春雨，力争库满塘饱，滴水不失，为早稻和夏收作物准备充沛的水源。
    工业战线的职工积极支援农业，生产了很多排灌机械和机电设备，最近正源源向农村调运；各地水利、商业、工业、交通等部门要密切协作，使这些设备都能及时装好，投入生产。已建成水工部分而机电设备短时期还不能运到的农村水电站，应当先利用水力加工粮食和棉花等等，不要为等待机器而使水白白流去。对于去冬抽调到水利工地的抽水动力机械，要在春灌和插秧用水季节到来之前，及早做好检修和归队工作；如果有一部分实在不能调回原地，更应早作安排，以求不误农时。
    新春就要到来了，许多光荣的紧迫的任务摆在水利战线上的全体同志们面前。去冬以来，水利建设一日千里，形势很好。河南、甘肃、湖南、广东、安徽等省已经先后提前超额完成了原定的年度计划。进度还比较迟缓的地区要赶快加强领导，向先进地区看齐。我们相信，在党的领导下，几千万水利大军坚持不懈地苦干巧干，1960年全国的水利建设任务一定能提前超额完成。谨祝新春中在水利战线上获得新的伟大胜利！
