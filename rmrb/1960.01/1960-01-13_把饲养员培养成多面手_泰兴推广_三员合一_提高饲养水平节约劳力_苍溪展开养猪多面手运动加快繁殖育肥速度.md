Cultivating Keepers into All-Rounders
　　Taixing Promotes "Three-in-One" to Improve Feeding Levels and Save Labor
　　Cangxi Launches an All-Round Pig Raising Movement to Accelerate Breeding and Fattening Speed

　　(Our report) Jiangsu's Taixing County is universally promoting a new feeding management system integrating feeders, disease prevention workers, and inseminators into a "three-in-one."

　　Feeding, disease prevention, and insemination are three related and important links in pig production. After communization, the collective pig raising industry developed rapidly, and new problems arose: disease prevention work was extensive, but there were few disease prevention workers, making it difficult to implement the policy of "prevention is more important than treatment"; inseminators, because they did not do feeding work on a regular basis, could not grasp the estrus period of sows, affecting the sows' full mating, full pregnancy, and full production. In addition, because the "three workers" each did their own thing, there was a shortage of labor during busy times, and waste during idle times.

　　Liuqiao Brigade of Changzhou Commune, which has four years of collective pig raising history, created an advanced "three-in-one" pig raising management system by having feeders, disease prevention workers, and inseminators exchange experiences and impart skills to each other. Feeders learned disease prevention and insemination, inseminators learned feeding and disease prevention, and disease prevention workers also understood feeding and insemination. The Taixing County Party Committee attached great importance to the experience of Liuqiao Brigade, summarized it in a timely manner, and held five training courses there, training a total of 520 feeders as the backbone for promoting "three-in-one." Communes and production brigades also used various methods, such as running pig raising red and expert schools, holding experience exchange meetings, master-apprentice training, and experienced workers leading new workers, to train and cultivate a large number of "three-in-one" feeders. Now, one-third of the 20,000 feeders in the county's collective pig farms have basically reached the "three-in-one" standard, and new situations have emerged in all aspects of the pig raising business.

　　First, the level of feeding management has been comprehensively improved, ensuring that sows produce more milk, pigs are full of meat, piglets are strong, and boars are in good condition. After the "three-in-one," the feeders are more careful in their pig raising work. They refine and carefully feed coarse feed, and give cold food in summer and warm food in winter. In summer, windows are opened for ventilation to prevent heatstroke; in winter, curtains are hung to keep warm. Piglets sleep in soft circles, and young pigs sleep in straw nests.

　　Secondly, since the feeders all do disease prevention work, they ensure the healthy growth of collectively raised pig herds. Feeders generally achieve "three looks" and "three skills" in disease prevention. The "three looks" are: look at the feeding to see if they are full or hungry, brush the pen to look at the pig manure, and look at the spirit in peacetime; the "three skills" are: being able to do disease prevention work, being able to use drugs for disinfection, and being able to treat general pig diseases. Because the disease prevention work is done better than in previous years, diseases that have harmed pigs in the past, such as swine fever, swine erysipelas, swine plague, and piglet white diarrhea, have been eradicated in the county in 1959.

　　Thirdly, after the "three-in-one," the feeders have comprehensively mastered the knowledge and skills of sow estrus, mating, and midwifery, ensuring that sows of the right age do not become empty, greatly improving the sow reproduction rate and piglet survival rate. The average number of piglets produced per litter by sows in the county has increased from 8.29 in the spring of last year to 9.24 now, and the survival rate of piglets has increased from 87.5% to 93.8%.

　　Fourthly, the "three-in-one" feeding management system can maximize the enthusiasm and creativity of the feeders, and greatly save pig raising labor. Now, in Taixing County, in addition to each commune and production brigade retaining a full-time disease prevention cadre to be responsible for the guidance of the feeders, the insemination work and the disease prevention work of the pig farms are all the responsibility of the feeders. According to preliminary statistics, the county has saved more than 5,000 laborers who have been put into other production. (Xu Xian, Zhang Jianzhong)

　　(Our report) Sichuan's Cangxi County is vigorously launching a mass movement of all-rounders among pig feeders, requiring feeders, castrators, disease prevention workers, and veterinarians to achieve "four-in-one."

　　At present, among the county's more than 22,000 feeders, there are more than 7,200 all-rounders who have mastered the "six arts" of raising pigs, growing feed, mating, castrating, preventing diseases, and treating diseases. Among them, more than 2,000 people also have the level of veterinarians, and there are 108 all-rounders in the county's more than 4,800 feedlots.

　　The Cangxi County pig raising all-rounder movement started in 1957. At that time, the county party committee found that the pig raising industry was developing rapidly, labor was tight, and technical personnel could not keep up with the needs. At that time, there were only more than 110,000 pigs in the county. The county party committee planned to develop to one pig per person in the first step, that is, 400,000 pigs. In this way, the county would need more than 30,000 feeders, veterinarians, disease prevention workers, and feed producers, accounting for nearly 20% of the total labor force in the county; among them, the number of veterinary personnel needed to be increased to more than 1,000, while the county's total veterinary and disease prevention personnel were only 120 people. In response to this situation, the county party committee called on feeders to learn various technologies. After communization, with the development of the commune collective pig raising business and the establishment of collective feedlots, the county party committee further issued a call to launch an all-rounder movement, and under the slogan of "four-in-one, proficient in six arts," a pig raising upsurge was quickly set off.

　　In the movement, party organizations at all levels in Cangxi County first vigorously grasped political and ideological work. In response to the difficulties such as "pig doctors can't learn it" and "too troublesome" of a few people, the feeders launched discussions on the issues of "do we want to develop pig raising?" and "what are the benefits of all-rounders?" At the same time, a group of all-rounder pacesetters were established, and their advanced ideas and experiences were widely disseminated. In particular, led by Cheng Liang, the first secretary of the county party committee, the secretaries of party organizations at all levels in the county took the lead in establishing command fields in feedlots, and 50% of the commune party committee secretaries became pig raising all-rounders, which greatly encouraged and educated the masses.

　　In helping the feeders to quickly advance to all-rounders, the county adopted five methods to impart technology: 1. Run short-term training courses, absorbing some feeders and middle and primary school students to concentrate on learning and doing in the county and district, and at the same time intensively improve the level of the original folk veterinarians; 2. Master-apprentice training; 3. On-site visits and on-site teaching; 4. Teams set up herbal medicine shops, so that most feeders can understand the methods of making medicine and the knowledge of treating diseases through collecting herbs and making medicine; 5. Open correspondence schools.

　　With the deepening of the all-rounder movement, the problem of labor shortage has been greatly alleviated. At the beginning of 1958, there were more than 290,000 pigs in the county, with a total of more than 22,000 laborers, while recently the number of pigs has increased by more than 30%, but the labor has basically not increased; secondly, the county's veterinary disease prevention personnel have grown rapidly, basically meeting the needs of pig disease prevention and treatment.

    把饲养员培养成多面手
    泰兴推广“三员合一”提高饲养水平节约劳力

    本报讯  江苏泰兴县普遍推广饲养员、防疫员、配种员“三员合一”的新的饲养管理制度。
    饲养、防疫和配种是养猪生产中的三个相关的重要环节。公社化后，集体养猪业迅速发展，出现了新的问题：防疫工作面广量大，而防疫员少，很难贯彻“防重于治”的方针；配种员由于平时不做饲养工作，掌握不了母猪发情时期，影响母猪的全配、全孕、全产。此外，由于“三员”各干各行，忙时劳力缺乏，闲时又有浪费的情况。
    有着四年集体养猪历史的常周公社刘桥大队，通过饲养员、防疫员和配种员互相交流经验，传授技术，使饲养员学会了防疫和配种，配种员学会了饲养和防疫，防疫员也懂得了饲养和配种，创造出了“三员合一”的先进养猪管理制度。泰兴县委十分重视刘桥大队的经验，及时进行了总结，并在那里先后举办了五期训练班，一共培训了五百二十名饲养员，作为推广“三员合一”的骨干力量。各公社和生产大队也都以办养猪红专学校、开经验交流会、师傅带徒弟、老手带新手等各种办法，训练和培养了大批“三员合一”的饲养员。现在，全县集体养猪场的二万名饲养员中，已有三分之一的人基本上达到了“三员合一”的标准，因而在养猪事业的各个方面，都出现了新的局面。
    首先是全面提高了饲养管理水平，保证了母猪奶多，肥猪肉满，仔猪壮实，公猪膘好。“三员合一”以后，饲养员对养猪工作做得更细心了。他们将粗饲料精制细喂，夏天吃冷食，冬天吃温食。夏天，开窗通风防暑；冬天，挂帘保暖。猪仔睡软圈，苗猪睡草窝。
    其次，由于饲养员都做防疫工作，保证了集体饲养的猪群健康生长。饲养员在防疫方面，一般都做到了“三看”、“三会”。“三看”就是喂食看饱饿，刷圈看猪粪，平时看精神；“三会”就是会做防疫工作，会使用药物消毒，会医治一般猪病。由于防疫工作做得比往年更好，历年来危害猪的猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫和小猪白痢病等病疫，1959年已在全县绝迹了。
    第三，“三员合一”以后，饲养员全面掌握了母猪发情、配种、接生等常识和技术，保证了适龄母猪不空怀，大大提高了母猪繁殖率和小猪成活率。全县母猪平均每窝产仔从去年春天的八点二九头上升到现在的九点二四头，苗猪成活率由87．5％提高到93．8％。
    第四，“三员合一”的饲养管理制度，能够最大限度地发挥饲养员的积极性和创造性，大大节省了养猪劳动力。现在，泰兴县除了各个公社和生产大队还保留一名专职防疫干部，负责饲养员的辅导工作外，配种工作和养猪场的防疫工作，都由饲养员负责。据初步统计，全县共节约了五千多个劳动力投入了其它生产。  （徐先、张建中）
    本报讯  四川苍溪县在生猪饲养员中大力开展多面手的群众运动，要求饲养员、阉割员、防疫员、兽医员做到“四员合一”。
    目前，全县的二万二千多名饲养员中，达到能养猪、能种饲料、能配种、能阉割、能防疫、能治病“六艺”皆通的多面手有七千二百多人，其中有两千多人还具有兽医的水平，全县四千八百多个饲养场中有多面手一百零八人。
    苍溪县养猪多面手运动是从1957年开始的。当时县委发现养猪业迅速发展，劳动力紧张，技术人员赶不上需要。当时全县只有十一万多头猪，县委计划第一步发展到每人一头，即四十万头，这样全县就需要饲养员、兽医员、防疫员、饲料生产员等三万多人，占全县劳力总数近20％；其中兽医人员需要增到一千多人，而全县全部兽医和防疫人员只有一百二十个人。县委针对这种情况，在饲养员中号召学习各种技术。公社化后，随着公社集体养猪事业的发展，集体饲养场的建立，县委进一步发出了开展多面手运动的号召，在“四员合一，六艺精通”的口号下，迅速掀起养猪高潮。
    运动中，苍溪县各级党组织首先大力抓紧了政治思想工作，针对少数人的“猪大夫学不会”、“太麻烦”等畏难思想，在饲养员中，就“要不要发展养猪？”“多面手有什么好处？”等问题展开了讨论；同时树立了一批多面手标兵，广泛传播他们的先进思想和经验。特别是以县委第一书记程亮为首，全县各级党组织书记都带头到饲养场建立指挥田，先后有50％的公社党委书记成为养猪多面手，这大大鼓舞和教育了群众。
    在帮助饲养员迅速向多面手进军中，全县采取了五种方式传授技术：一、办短期训练班，吸收部分饲养员和中、小学生集中在县、区边学边做，同时集训提高原有民间兽医的水平；二、师傅带徒弟；三、现场参观、现场传授；四、队队开办草药铺，使大多数饲养员通过采药、制药，了解制药方法和治病知识；五、开办函授学校。
    随着多面手运动的深入开展，大大缓和了劳动力紧张问题。1958年初，全县养猪二十九万多头，劳力共计二万二千多人，而最近猪只增加30％多，但劳力基本上未增加；其次，全县兽医防疫人员迅速成长起来，基本上满足了猪只防疫治病的需要。  （谢长庚）
