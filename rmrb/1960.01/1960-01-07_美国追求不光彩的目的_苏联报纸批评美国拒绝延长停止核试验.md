Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 6th: The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" published a commentary on January 5th regarding the U.S. government's decision to refuse to extend the moratorium on nuclear weapons testing, stating that world public opinion believes that the U.S. government's decision, made as the Geneva Three-Nation Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests is about to resume after a short recess to sign a treaty on the complete cessation of nuclear tests, cannot be considered a proper step.

Foreign newspapers are widely criticizing the United States for deliberately creating obstacles and hindering the achievement of an international agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests.

The commentary said that there is no basis to believe that this decision by the U.S. government will be welcomed in the United States itself.

The newspaper pointed out that certain groups and publications in the United States are making far-fetched defenses for this decision, saying that the United States made this decision to accelerate the conclusion of an agreement on banning testing. The newspaper emphasized that if there is a genuine desire to solve this problem, if there is a genuine readiness to hold a summit meeting, then, under no circumstances should any actions be taken that complicate the ongoing and upcoming talks.

The commentary said that a propaganda campaign clamoring for the resumption of nuclear tests has long begun in the United States. Former U.S. President Truman, billionaire Rockefeller, who once sought the U.S. presidency, and other representatives of monopoly groups related to the production of atomic weapons, have clamored in this way. The newspaper pointed out, isn't it obvious that passing such a provocative decision is in their interests?

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 4th: The "Soviet Russia" newspaper published an article today pointing out that the U.S. government's announcement of its refusal to extend the moratorium on nuclear weapon testing is like "putting a tar ladle in the New Year's honey pot." The article asked, how can one explain the U.S. government's announcement of such an extremely strange decision just when an agreement has finally been reached on holding a summit meeting?

The article said that at the Geneva conference, there was indeed a scientific debate on the issue of methods for detecting underground explosions. However, this debate was not initiated by Soviet experts. The debate concerned whether it was possible to distinguish between underground atomic-hydrogen explosions and natural vibrations, such as earthquakes. After studying the so-called "new data" from the United States, Soviet scientists reached different conclusions from their American counterparts. It seems that this is a purely technical issue and not, as the U.S. government imagines, a "political consideration." It is clear that it was not Soviet experts, but the U.S. government, who hastily drew political conclusions under the pretext of the Geneva scientific debate. It is quite obvious that this is being done to pursue dishonorable purposes.

    美国追求不光彩的目的
    苏联报纸批评美国拒绝延长停止核试验
    据新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联“消息报”5日就美国政府决定拒绝延长停止核武器试验的期限一事发表评论说，世界舆论认为，当日内瓦三国停止核武器试验会议经过短期休会而即将复会来签订彻底停止核试验的条约的时候，美国政府作出的这一决定，无论如何也不能说是正当的步骤。
    外国报纸都在纷纷指责美国故意制造障碍，阻挠就停止核试验问题达成国际协议。
    评论说，没有根据认为，美国政府的这一决定在美国本国会受到欢迎。
    报纸指出，美国某些集团和报刊为这一决定进行强词夺理的辩护，说什么美国作出这一决定是为了加速达成关于禁止试验的协议。报纸着重指出，如果真正渴望解决这一问题，如果真正准备举行最高级会议，那么，无论如何也不应当采取任何使正在举行和即将举行的会谈复杂化的行动。
    评论说，叫嚷要恢复核试验的宣传运动在美国早已开始。前美国总统杜鲁门、曾经追求过美国总统职位的亿万富翁洛克菲勒，以及其他一些同原子武器的生产有关系的垄断集团的代表人物，就曾经这样叫嚷过。报纸指出，通过这种挑衅性的决定是符合于他们的利益的，这难道还不很明显吗？
    据新华社莫斯科4日电　“苏维埃俄罗斯报”今天发表文章指出，美国政府宣布拒绝延长停止试验核武器，这就像“把焦油杓子放在新年的蜜桶里”。文章问道，正当就举行最高级会议终于达成协议的时候，美国政府宣布这样一个极其奇怪的决定，这究竟如何解释呢？
    文章说，在日内瓦会议上，确实对发现地下爆炸的方法问题进行过科学的争论。但是，这次争论并不是苏联专家引起的。争论曾经涉及到是否可以区别地下原子——氢爆炸和自然震动，如地震的问题。苏联科学家在研究了美国的所谓“新资料”之后，得出了和他们的美国同行不同的结论。看来，这是纯技术问题，而决不像美国政府想像的那样是“政治考虑”。由此可见，在日内瓦科学争论的借口下匆忙作出政治结论的不是苏联专家，而是美国政府。十分明显，这样做是为了追求不光彩的目的。
