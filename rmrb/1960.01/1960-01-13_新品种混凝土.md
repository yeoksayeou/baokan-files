New Types of Concrete

    Heat-Resistant Concrete
    Heat-resistant concrete is made of cement, blast furnace slag or crushed firebricks mixed with some fireclay. Its maximum operating temperature can reach 700 degrees Celsius. Heat-resistant concrete for up to 1400 degrees Celsius has now been successfully developed. Heat-resistant concrete has been widely used in projects such as the foundations of blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, coke ovens, aluminum electrolytic cells, alkali recovery furnaces, and flues. Since 1957, Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, and other companies have used more than 40,000 cubic meters of heat-resistant concrete made from blast furnace slag alone, saving more than 4.7 million yuan. Heat-resistant concrete not only saves refractory bricks, but is also low in cost and easy to construct.
    Waterproof Concrete
    Waterproof concrete is made of the same materials as ordinary concrete, also mixed with cement, sand, and stone. However, waterproof concrete is much denser than ordinary concrete and can achieve waterproofing without the addition of other waterproof materials. The cost of waterproof concrete is slightly higher than that of ordinary concrete, but it is much lower than the cost of ordinary concrete with added waterproof materials such as asphalt felt, and even cheaper than using steel plates for waterproofing. In recent years, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Daye Steel Plant, Baotou Iron and Steel and other units have used waterproof concrete in large-scale equipment foundations, water pools, water towers, charging car pits, and pumping stations. In 1958 alone, more than 360,000 cubic meters were used, saving nearly one million yuan.
    Acid-Resistant and Alkali-Resistant Concrete
    Acid-resistant concrete is generally made of water glass, quartz stone, and sodium silicofluoride. This type of concrete can be used in pickling tanks and acid-corroded container equipment, replacing expensive metal materials or acid-resistant bricks. Alkali-resistant concrete is made of ordinary cement, sand, and stone, but the stones are alkali-resistant aggregates such as limestone and dolomite. If alkali-resistant cement is used instead of ordinary cement, the alkali resistance is even better. Using alkali-resistant concrete in an alkali-resistant tank can save 20 tons of steel. These two types of acid and alkali corrosion resistant concrete have been widely used in many projects.

    新品种混凝土
    耐热混凝土
    耐热混凝土用水泥、高炉矿渣或碎耐火砖加一些火泥配制而成。最高使用温度可以达到摄氏七百度。现已研究成功摄氏一千四百度的耐热混凝土。在高炉、平炉的基础，焦炉、铝电解槽、碱回收炉及烟道等工程上，耐热混凝土已经大量使用。从一九五七年起，鞍钢、武钢、包钢等仅用高炉矿渣配制的耐热混凝土就有四万多立方米，共节约四百七十多万元。耐热混凝土不仅能节约耐火砖，而且造价低，施工方便。
    防水混凝土
    防水混凝土和普通混凝土所用的材料一样，也是用水泥、砂、石调制而成的。不过，防水混凝土比普通混凝土密实得多，不必另加防水材料就可以达到防水的目的。防水混凝土的造价比普通混凝土稍高，但比普通混凝土要增加沥青卷材等防水材料费用就低得多，比用钢板防水就更便宜了。近年来，武钢、大冶钢厂、包钢等单位在大型设备基础、水池、水塔、料车坑、水泵站等工程上都使用了防水混凝土，仅一九五八年就使用三十六万多立方米，节约资金近百万元左右。
    耐酸混凝土和耐碱混凝土
    耐酸混凝土一般是用水玻璃、石英石和矽氟酸钠调制而成的。这种混凝土可以用于酸洗槽和受酸侵蚀的容器设备中，代替贵重的金属材料或耐酸砖。耐碱混凝土是用普通水泥、砂、石调制而成的，只是其中的石子是石灰石、白云石之类的耐碱石料。如果采用耐碱水泥代替普通水泥，耐碱性能更好。在一个耐碱槽上使用耐碱混凝土就可以节省钢材二十吨。这两种防酸、碱腐蚀的混凝土，已经在许多工程中广泛应用。
