    Ten years ago, it was 1949. My hometown, Chengdu, Sichuan, was liberated. I was only ten years old then, and the People's Liberation Army comrades lived in my house. There were two comrades surnamed Zhang in the same company. To make it easier to call them, I called the older one Da Lao Zhang (Old Zhang) and the younger one, who was only nineteen, Xiao Lao Zhang (Little Zhang). I got along best with Xiao Lao Zhang. As soon as he finished his drills, I would always pull him to tell me stories about fighting. Once, he told me the story of Dong Cunrui. When he got to the part about his sacrifice, my eyes were already full of tears, leaving an indelible impression on my young mind. Later, when I was in sixth grade, I borrowed a collection of short stories published by China Youth Publishing House from the school library. When I opened the first page of the book, the three words "Dong Cunrui" were imprinted in my eyes. I was so happy that I almost jumped up. I never thought that the story Xiao Lao Zhang told me would be printed in a book. After I finished reading it, I returned the book to the library. I thought to myself, how great it would be to have a copy to keep by my side! So, I saved a few cents from my breakfast every day, and after saving for more than two months, I finally bought the book. It has been a full six years now. It has accompanied me from Sichuan to Beijing. I read it whenever I had time on the train or ship to Beijing. I memorized entire sections word for word. I recited it to my younger brother and sister like reciting a novel, I don't know how many times. Later, when they saw me, they would always smile and say, "Are you going to tell the story of Dong Cunrui again?"
    In 1954, I became a worker, and I brought this book with me. Later, I also lent it to other female workers. On the blank page on the back of the book, there is a record that reads, "This book was circulated within the Second Group of the C Class of the fine yarn workshop of the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill for nearly three months. Every girl in the group reread it several times. As a result, the cover of this book has been damaged."
    This book has had a significant impact on myself and my sisters. Looking back now, when I first started working, I felt that everything in the factory was new, but after a few days, I felt that there was nothing to learn, my thoughts were very unstable, I didn't work with peace of mind, and the quality also declined. But when I thought of Dong Cunrui, I felt like I had done something shameful. When I returned to the dormitory, I couldn't sleep in bed, so I picked up this book from the bedside and started reading it. My eyes lit up. When I read the following passage: "Dong Cunrui resolutely used his left hand to hold up the explosive and press it against the bottom of the enemy's bridge. He raised his head and said to Zhi Shunyi, 'If I don't complete it, you complete it!' He pulled the fuse with his right hand, used all his strength, and shouted loudly, 'Comrades! For victory, advance!' With a flash of fire, a huge sound shook the mountains and the earth. In the smoke, the bridge-shaped pillbox flew into the air. Dong Cunrui bravely sacrificed his young life and used his body to open up the road ahead for the troops." I thought to myself how empty my heart was compared to Dong Cunrui! Thinking about how we are all living a happy life now, it is all thanks to Dong Cunrui and so many revolutionary martyrs who exchanged it with their blood. Although I have read Dong Cunrui's heroic deeds more than once, each time it has given me a profound education.
    During the Great Leap Forward last year, the speed of the machines in our factory was increased, and the output more than doubled compared to the past. As the speed increased, there were more thread breaks, so we repaired the machines day and night. Whenever the workshop needed us, we would go to the workshop. I always said to everyone, "Comrades, the workshop is the battlefield. Dong Cunrui is our example. We must weave more cloth and spin more yarn so that people all over the country can wear new clothes." At everyone's request, we established the Dong Cunrui Shock Brigade. Everyone demanded very strict standards of themselves, and our Dong Cunrui Shock Brigade won the red flag. I also wrote a poem called "Fighting in the Workshop," which included the following lines:
    This is the workshop of battle,
    But there are no days of gunfire,
    And whistling bullets.
    Young Dong Cunrui shock troops!
    Come to the workshop together.
    Fight! Heroes,
    Be sure to repair the machines well.
    Let the broken threads disappear,
    Let the high-speed car turn faster,
    Let the production double again!
    Sun!
    You may go to the western hills to sleep,
    Tomorrow you will see our results,
    The spindles are spinning at high speed...
    Dong Cunrui dedicated his young life to the great and magnificent revolutionary cause for the sake of the motherland and the people. His name shines with eternal brilliance among our people, giving us strength and courage. We must contribute all our strength to the construction of socialism and communism.

    董存瑞和我们在一起
    北京第二棉纺织厂工人  陈开第
    这是一篇动人的文字。我们希望读者寄来这一类稿子。
                                                ——编者
    十年前，那是1949年。我的家乡四川成都解放了。那时我才十岁，解放军同志住在我家。有两位姓张的同志，都在一个连队，为了好叫，年纪大一点的，我就叫他大老张，年纪只有十九岁的，我叫他小老张。我和小老张是最玩的到一块的。他一下完操，我总拉着他给我讲打仗的故事。有一次他给我讲董存瑞的故事，当讲到他牺牲时，我的眼泪早流满了脸，在我幼小的心灵里留下了不可磨灭的印象。后来我上小学六年级，在学校图书馆借到中国青年出版社出版的一本短篇故事集，当我翻开书的第一页，“董存瑞”三个大字就印入我的眼睛，我当时高兴的都要跳起来了，想不到小老张给我讲的故事会印出书来。我看完后，把书还给图书馆。自己又想有一本放在我身边有多好啊！我就每天吃早点时，留下几分钱，存了有两个多月，终于把这本书买了回来。到现在已经整整六个年头了。它伴随着我从四川到北京。我在来京的火车上轮船上有时间就看，有的一整段我都一字不差地背了下来。我像朗诵小说一样在我弟弟姐姐面前不知讲了多少遍，后来他们一见我，总是笑着说：“又是讲董存瑞的故事吗？”
    在1954年我当了工人，这本书也一同带着。后来还借给别的女工们看，在书的背面空白页上，有这样一段文字记录，“此书曾在北京第二棉纺织厂细纱丙班二组内传阅近三个月，全组每个姑娘都重读了几遍。因此此书封面已破损了。”
    这本书对我自己和姐妹们的教育都相当大。现在回想起来，我刚参加工作时，一进工厂什么都觉得新鲜，但过了不多日子，就觉得没什么可学的，思想上很不稳定，工作起来就不安心，质量也下降。但我想到董存瑞时，自己就感到做了一件见不得人的事一样。回到宿舍躺在床上又睡不着，随手从床头取下这本书读了起来，我的眼睛亮堂起来了。当我读到以下这样一段描写：“董存瑞毅然地用左手托起了炸药，抵在敌人桥底上，昂起头来，对郅顺义说：‘要是我没有完成，你来完成它！’用右手拉着导火线，用尽全身力量，大声叫起来：‘同志们！为了胜利，前进！’随着火光一闪，巨大的响声震得山摇地动，在烟雾中，桥型碉堡飞向空中了。董存瑞英勇地献出了自己年轻的生命，用自己的身体为部队开辟了前进的道路。”我就想到自己和董存瑞比起来，内心是多么空虚！想想现在我们每个人都过着幸福的生活，这都是由于董存瑞和许许多多的革命先烈们用鲜血换来的，虽然我不只一次地读着董存瑞的英雄事迹，但每一次都给了我深刻的教育。
    去年大跃进，我们厂里的机器加快了车速，比过去产量增加一倍多，车速加快了，断头就多，我们就不分黑夜白天地检修机器。什么时候车间里需要，我们就什么时候进车间，我总是对大家说：“同志们，车间就是战场，董存瑞是我们的榜样，多织布纺纱使全国人民都穿上新衣。”在大家的要求下，我们又成立了董存瑞突击队。大家都要求自己非常严格，我们董存瑞突击队得了大红旗。我还写了一首诗：“战斗在车间”，其中有这样的诗句：
    这是战斗的车间，
    但没有连天的炮火，
    和呼啸的子弹。
    年轻的董存瑞突击手啊！
    一齐来到车间。
    战斗吧！英雄们，
    一定要把机器检修好。
    让白花断头滚蛋，
    让高速车转的更快，
    让生产再加一番！
    太阳啊！
    你尽管到西山去睡吧，
    明天就会看到我们的战果，
    纱锭在高速中飞旋……
    董存瑞为了祖国和人民，把自己年轻的生命献给了伟大壮丽的革命事业。他的名字在我们人民中闪耀着永世不灭的光辉，他给我们力量和勇气。我们要为建设社会主义和共产主义而贡献出我们的全部力量。
