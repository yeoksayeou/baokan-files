Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China announced today two hundred and fifty-eight national records as of December 31, 1959. These include sports such as track and field, swimming, weightlifting, speed skating, track cycling, archery, horse racing, steeplechase, shooting, radio, parachuting, gliding, aviation models, and nautical models.

This is the largest number of national sports records announced in any year. It is seventy-five more than the national records announced in 1959 up to 1958 (one hundred and eighty-three items). Among them, the national records for nine men's and women's track cycling events, six men's and women's horse racing events, three men's and women's steeplechase events, thirteen aviation model events, and twenty men's and women's archery events conducted according to international rules are being announced for the first time.

Of the two hundred and fifty-eight national records announced, more than four-fifths (two hundred and eleven items) were created in 1959. Furthermore, in swimming, weightlifting, shooting, parachuting, aviation models, and other sports, there are new world records created in 1959, indicating that China's sports level has greatly improved on the basis of 1958.

Among the two hundred and fifty-eight national records, one hundred and three were created at the First National Games held in 1959. This National Games centrally demonstrated the significant improvement in the level of sports in China over the past decade, based on the widespread development of mass sports activities. Before the National Games, more than 50 million people across the country participated in selection competitions at various levels. At the National Games, more than 600 athletes broke national records or created new national achievements more than 800 times, making this National Games an unprecedented "large-area harvest" in the history of Chinese sports.

Chinese men's and women's athletes in track and field, swimming, speed skating, shooting and other sports improved their performances rapidly in 1959. Of the forty-seven national shooting records announced, forty-three were created in 1959. Of the ten national speed skating records, nine were created in 1959. Among them, the new national record of 42.4 seconds for the men's 500-meter speed skating was created by Yang Jucheng when he won the silver medal in this event at the World Men's Speed Skating Championships in February 1959. In track and field, Sichuan athlete Chen Jiaquan and Hubei athlete Li Bihua both broke the national record of 10.6 seconds for the men's 100 meters set by Liang Jianxun in 1958, with both of them creating a new national record of 10.5 seconds. The new national records for women's 100 meters and 80-meter hurdles created by Jiang Yumin and Liu Zheng in 1959, respectively, reached world levels. The young swimmer Fu Dajin also created a new national record of 56.8 seconds in the men's 100-meter freestyle.

Due to the increase in new players, the national records of many sports have changed repeatedly, being broken dozens of times a year. Many new players have also replaced old players and become national record holders for the first time. The three national records for middleweight weightlifting created by the famous athletes Huang Qianghui and Zhu Hongquan in 1958 have now been replaced by newer records created by Qiu Rongshan, Shu Gang, and Peng Guofu. Chen Rong, a nurse from Guangzhou, created a world record of 589 rings in the women's small-bore rifle 50-meter and 100-meter prone shooting events for the first time. New names such as Guo Xin'e, Mei Yan, Zhang Jingwen, Zhao Chengying, Wang Suzhen, and Gao Ming have also appeared in the national parachuting records. They have all broken world records.

Of the two hundred and fifty-eight national records, only forty-eight were created in other years. Among them, thirty-three were created in 1958, six in 1957, seven in 1956, and one in 1954.

    体委公布1959年全国纪录
    共258项，比前年多75项，大部是去年新创
    新人辈出，纪录一变再变，有的项目一年打破几十次
    新华社10日讯　中华人民共和国体育运动委员会今天公布了截至1959年12月31日为止的二百五十八项全国纪录。其中包括田径、游泳、举重、速度滑冰、赛车场自行车、射箭、赛马、障碍赛马、射击、无线电、跳伞、滑翔、航空模型、航海模型等体育运动项目。
    这是历年来公布体育运动全国纪录项目最多的一次。它比1959年公布的截至1958年为止的全国纪录（一百八十三项）多了七十五项。其中九项男女赛车场赛自行车、六项男女赛马、三项男女障碍赛马、十三项航空模型和按照国际规则进行比赛的二十项男女射箭的全国纪录，都是第一次公布。
    在公布的二百五十八项全国纪录中，有五分之四以上（二百一十一项）是在1959年创造的，而且在游泳、举重、射击、跳伞、航空模型等项目中，都包括有在1959年新创造的世界纪录，这说明我国体育运动水平在1958年的基础上又有了很大提高。
    在二百五十八项全国纪录中，有一百零三项是在1959年举行的第一届全国运动会上创造的。这次全运会集中地表现了十年来我国在广泛开展群众性体育运动的基础上，体育运动水平有了显著提高。全运会前，全国共有五千多万人参加了各地、各级的选拔赛。全运会上，共有六百多名运动员八百多次打破了全国纪录或创造了全国新成绩，使这次全运会获得了我国体育史上空前的“大面积丰收”。
    我国男女田径、游泳、速度滑冰、射击等项目的选手，1959年提高成绩很快。在公布的四十七项射击全国纪录中，有四十三项是在1959年创造的。十项速度滑冰全国纪录中，在1959年创造的有九项。其中男子五百米速度滑冰四十二秒四的全国新纪录，是杨菊成1959年2月参加世界男子速度滑冰锦标赛获得这项比赛亚军时所创造的。在田径运动方面，四川选手陈家全、湖北选手李必华两人都刷新了梁建勋在1958年创造的男子百米十秒六的全国纪录，他们创造的全国新纪录都是十秒五。姜玉民、刘正在1959年分别创造的女子百米和八十米低栏的全国新纪录，都达到了世界水平。年轻的游泳选手符大进也在男子百米自由泳的项目中，创造了五十六秒八的全国新纪录。
    由于新手的增多，使许多项目的全国纪录一变再变，一年打破十几次甚至几十次。不少新手还代替老手，第一次成了全国纪录保持者。由著名选手黄强辉、朱鸿全在1958年创造的中量级举重三个单项全国纪录，目前已分别由丘荣山、舒刚、彭国富三人所创造的更新纪录所代替。广州的护士陈蓉第一次创造了自选小口径步枪五十和一百米各三十发卧射五百八十九环的世界纪录。在跳伞的全国纪录中，也出现了郭新娥、梅严、张景文、赵成英、王素珍、高明等新手的名字。她们都曾经打破过世界纪录。
    在二百五十八项全国纪录中，只有四十八项是在其他年份创造的。其中1958年创造的占三十三项，1957年的六项，1956年的七项，1954年的一项。
