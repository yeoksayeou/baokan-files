    "Sunset Plum"
    (Four Poems)
    Railway Worker from Yunnan Province, Xiao Bao

    Red Army Whetstone
    At the bridgehead of the winding Nanpan River,
    A whetstone stands, green and serene;
    Twenty-some years ago, the Red Army sharpened their swords upon it,
    The five characters “Red Army Whetstone” never rust.

    At the bridgehead of the winding Nanpan River,
    Today, railway soldiers roar with songs;
    Dipping their steel drills in the Nanpan River's water to sharpen them,
    The railway is built along the Red Army's footsteps.

    "Sunset Plum"
    As red as a torch,
    Is the camellia on the mountaintop;
    With fragrance filling the air,
    Is the Michelia alba at the foot of the mountain;
    But these cannot compare
    To the "Sunset Plum" on the mountainside.

    The sun has just set,
    Railway soldiers return from the construction site,
    The roaring of continuous cannon fire sounds,
    Sparks illuminate the afterglow of the setting sun;
    Half the mountain is cleared,
    The "Sunset Plum" competes with the evening glow in beauty.

    What a wonderful night,
    On the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau,
    We have lit a bonfire;
    After joyful labor,
    We rest in our tents.

    The stars watch over us,
    The moon talks with us;
    Young men play the erhu,
    Girls sing folk songs from their hometowns.

    The lights connect with the stars,
    As if the Milky Way has fallen from the sky;
    What a beautiful night,
    What a wonderful life!

    Love-the-People Station
    Beside the bustling construction site,
    Soldiers set up a tent:
    "Grandma, you are tired from walking,
    Drink a cup of fragrant tea and feel relaxed!"

    "Grandpa, please smoke a pot of dry tobacco,
    To show your son's feelings!"
    Grandma moves her mouth but doesn't speak,
    Gently touching the soldier's collar badge.

    “落日梅”
    （诗四首）
    云南省铁路工人　晓报
    红军磨刀石
    弯弯的南盘江的桥头，
    一块磨刀石青幽幽；
    二十几年前红军在上面磨过战刀，
    “红军磨刀石”五个大字永不生锈。
    弯弯的南盘江桥头，
    今日铁道兵歌声吼；
    蘸干盘江水磨利钢钎，
    铁路顺着红军的脚印修。
    “落日梅”
    红似火把的，
    是山顶的茶花；
    香味扑鼻的，
    是山脚下的缅桂；
    但这些都比不上
    半山腰的“落日梅”。
    太阳刚刚落下，
    铁道兵从工地返回，
    轰隆隆的连珠炮响了，
    火花映照着落日的余辉；
    半个山让开路了，
    “落日梅”和晚霞比美。
    多么好的夜呵
    在云贵高原上，
    是我们点起了篝火；
    愉快的劳动过后，
    躺在帐棚里歇脚。
    星星守望着我们，
    月亮和我们谈说；
    小伙子拉着二胡，
    姑娘唱起家乡的情歌。
    灯光和星星相连，
    好像落下了天上的银河；
    多么美丽的夜呵，
    多么好的生活！
    爱民站
    热闹的工地旁，
    战士搭起棚帐：
    “阿妈走路累了，
    喝杯香茶心舒畅！”
    “阿爹请吸一锅旱烟，
    表一表儿子的心肠！”
    阿妈咻动着嘴后不说话，
    轻轻地摸着战士的领章。
