    “King of Feed” Ascends the Throne
    Ji She
    Corn—the "King of Feed"—has recently "ascended the throne" in Beitada Village, Fuzuo Commune, Hejian County, Hebei Province. The village's Party branch, adopting the method of simultaneous experimentation and promotion, broke the historical notion that "pigs don't eat pointy-leaf crops" (referring to corn, etc.). They used corn stalks, cobs, etc., to process a large quantity of feed, solving the "food problem" for 1,250 pigs for three months. In addition, a small amount of cornmeal was used as concentrated feed, which can promote milk production and health for sows about to give birth, and it has special effects for fattening pigs. The village plans to sow 1,200 mu of spring and summer corn this year, more than double that of 1959, to meet the needs of the high-speed development of animal husbandry, with pig raising as the head.

    In 1959, Beitada Village conscientiously implemented the policy of self-breeding and self-raising, and by autumn, the number of pigs had increased to more than 400, of which more than 80% were sows. More pigs meant more fertilizer, which meant more grain. The average yield of grain crops on the village's 3,200 mu of cultivated land reached 416 jin per mu, exceeding any previous year. In addition to overfulfilling the state grain purchase task of 190,000 jin, the team also stored more than 60,000 jin of grain. As a result of the autumn harvest distribution, the average collective income of each labor force reached 240 yuan. The development of agriculture has further promoted the pig raising industry. Since the autumn harvest, teams and households have been adding pigs and building sties. As of the end of November 1959, the number of pigs had increased to 658.

    In early December 1959, after carefully studying the experience of Kuixingzhuang in Wuqiao County in raising pigs at high speed, the village's Party branch made a strong determination to catch up with Kuixing at a rapid pace and strive to achieve one pig per mu before the Spring Festival. When the Party branch convened a meeting of Party members and cadres to discuss this plan, most people believed that the village had many sows and there was no major problem with the source of pigs. However, when it came to feed, everyone was worried. According to the principle of focusing on coarse feed, achieving one pig per mu would require at least 870,000 jin of coarse feed before the wheat harvest in 1960. But after calculating the family assets, even including sweet potato vines, peanut skins, cotton bowls, and collected wild vegetables and tree leaves, there were only 510,000 jin, a shortage of 360,000 jin. Under this situation, a few people developed a sense of difficulty and proposed asking the higher authorities for feed; otherwise, the pig raising plan would not be completed. Most people believed that pigs were being raised on a large scale everywhere, so they could not reach out to the higher authorities for feed, but they couldn't think of a good solution. At this time, Zhao Hui, the branch secretary, said: "The pig feed problem must be solved through self-reliance. This year, we planted 513 mu of corn, and using a large amount of corn stalks, leaves, etc., to feed pigs can solve the feed problem. The masses say that pigs don't eat pointy-leaf crops. This time, we must personally take action, make a model, and break through this barrier." Everyone agreed with the secretary's opinion and instructed Wu Zhizhong, the deputy branch secretary, Dong Yusheng, the director of the pig farm, and Ma Shanfeng, the feeder, to conduct experiments.

    After the meeting, they chopped and dried the corn stalks, and then used a mill to grind them into fine flour. When they grabbed a handful and smelled it, it had a fragrant aroma, and the three of them gained confidence. Initially, they mixed this feed flour with sorghum stalks, sweet potato vines, etc. (half and half), and the pigs loved to eat it. Later, they only fed the feed made from corn stalks, and the pigs still scrambled to eat it. Therefore, the branch immediately held an "on-site meeting" at the pig farm, mobilizing Party members, Youth League members, feeders, and activists from all seven production teams in the village to visit, and allowing people to take some back to experiment with themselves. On this day, people flocked to the pig farm to visit, and many old men and feeders used baskets to take back some feed made from corn stalks.

    In the evening, the Party branch convened a meeting of all Party members, cadres, and feeders to specifically discuss their impressions after the visit. Wu Xiushan (team leader) was the first to speak. He said: "In the past, I had conservative ideas. The teenagers in our village would say, 'Pigs eat all kinds of grass, just afraid you won't find it,' but I insisted that corn stalks could not be used to feed pigs. Today, I saw the facts and still didn't believe it, thinking that pigs would gnaw on a brick if they were hungry enough. Later, I fed those just-fed pigs the basket of feed I brought back, and they scrambled to eat it, which is when I believed it." Then, Ma Dongsheng (team leader) said: "Today, I learned that corn is a good feed for pigs from head to toe. Our team plans to raise 400 pigs before the Spring Festival, guaranteeing that we won't ask the commune for feed!" Through the discussion, Party members and cadres from all seven teams planned to process all the by-products of the 513 mu of corn, without distributing them, burning them, or using them for other purposes, into coarse feed for pigs. According to preliminary calculations, a total of 210,000 jin of coarse feed can be produced, enough for 1,256 pigs to eat for three months. If we also consider the utilization of sorghum stalks and other straw, calculating one pig per mu, we can not only be self-sufficient in coarse feed before the wheat harvest this year, but also have a surplus of about 100,000 jin.

    Currently, the village is preparing to build a large-scale feed crushing plant driven by two power machines, and each of the seven teams has built one to two drying kilns, rushing to crush and process corn stalks and cobs in large quantities, planning to process and store all the pigs' "rations" before the Spring Festival. At the same time, the opening up of new feed sources has further promoted the great development of pigs. As of December 22, 1959, the village had increased the number of pigs raised from 658 at the end of November to 1,570, an increase of nearly 1.4 times in more than 20 days.

    “饲料之王”登殿就位
    冀社
    玉米——“饲料之王”最近在河北河间县付佐公社北答村“登殿就位”了。这个村的党支部，采取边试验、边推广的方法，打破了历史上一般人认为“猪不吃尖叶庄稼”（指玉米等）的说法，利用玉米秸、轴等加工出大批饲料，解决了一千二百五十头猪三个月的“口粮”；另外用少量玉米面作精饲料，喂临产母猪可以催奶保健，用来催肥长肉更是特效。这个村计划今年播种春夏玉米一千二百亩，比1959年扩大一倍以上，以适应高速度发展以养猪为首的畜牧业生产的需要。
    1959年北答村由于认真贯彻执行了自繁自养的方针，秋前猪发展到四百多只，其中80％以上是母猪。猪多——肥多——粮多，全村三千二百亩耕地，粮食作物平均亩产达到四百一十六斤，产量超过以往任何一年。除超额完成国家十九万斤粮食征购任务外，队里还贮备粮食六万多斤。秋收分配的结果，每个劳动力的集体收入平均达到二百四十元。农业的发展，又进一步促进了养猪业。秋收以来，队队户户添猪垒圈，截至1959年11月底，猪增加到六百五十八头。
    1959年12月初，这个村的党支部经过认真学习吴桥县魁星庄高速度养猪的经验，立下雄心壮志，决心快马加鞭赶魁星，争取在春节前实现一亩一头猪。党支部召开党员干部会，讨论这个计划时，一般人认为本村母猪多，猪源没有多大问题；可是一提到饲料，人们都发了愁。根据以粗饲料为主的方针，实现一亩地一头猪，到1960年麦收前至少需要粗饲料八十七万斤。但计算了一下家底，把山芋蔓、花生皮、棉花碗和采集的野菜、树叶等都算进来也只有五十一万斤，尚缺三十六万斤。在这种情况下，少数人产生了畏难情绪，提出向上级要饲料，不然，养猪计划就完不成；多数人则认为，现在到处大量养猪，不能伸手向上要饲料，可是又苦于想不出个好办法。这时，支部书记赵辉说：“猪饲料要自力更生解决。今年我们种玉米五百一十三亩，大量用玉米茎、叶等喂猪，就可以解决饲料问题。群众说猪不吃尖叶庄稼，这次我们要亲自下手，作出样板来，突破这一关。”大家同意支书的意见，并责成支部副书记吴志仲、养猪场长董玉盛和饲养员马山峰三人专门搞试验。
    会后，他们把玉米秸切碎、烘干，然后用碾子轧成细面，抓一把一闻，有香味，三个人便有了信心。开始，把这种饲料面和高粱帽、山芋蔓等混合在一起（对半掺），猪挺爱吃；后来，就光喂玉米秸制的饲料，猪还是抢着吃。于是支部立即在养猪场召开“现场会”，发动全村七个生产小队的党团员、饲养员和群众积极分子来参观，并允许人们捎点回去自己试验。这一天，到猪场参观的人络绎不绝，不少老头和饲养员都用簸箕捎回一些玉米秸制成的饲料。
    晚上，党支部召开全体党员干部和饲养员大会，专门座谈参观后的感想。吴秀山（小队长）第一个发言，他说：“过去我有保守思想。咱村十几岁的孩子都会说‘猪吃百样草，就怕你不找’，我倒一口咬定说玉米秸喂猪不行，今天看到事实还不相信，认为猪饿了迂上块砖头也会啃几嘴；后来，把端回来的一簸箕饲料喂那些刚吃饱的猪，结果它们也抢着吃，我这才算信服了。”接着，马东升（小队长）说：“今天才知道玉米浑身上下都是猪的好饲料。我们小队计划春节前养猪四百头，保证不向公社伸手要饲料！”通过座谈，七个小队的党员干部都计划要把五百一十三亩玉米的副产品，不分掉、不烧掉、不用掉，全部加工成猪的粗饲料。据初步计算，共计可以制出粗饲料二十一万斤，足够一千二百五十六头猪吃三个月。如果再算上多穗高粱等秸秆的利用，按一亩地一头猪计算，到今年麦收前，不但粗饲料能够自给自足，而且还可以节余十万斤左右。
    目前，这个村正在筹建一座由两台动力机械带动的大型饲料粉碎厂，七个小队队队建起了一至二个烘干窑，大量突击玉米秸、玉米轴的粉碎和加工，计划在春节前把全部猪的“口粮”加工贮备好。同时，由于开辟了饲料新来源，进一步促进了猪的大发展。到1959年12月22日为止，全村养猪已由11月底的六百五十八头发展到了一千五百七十头，二十多天的时间，猪增加将近一点四倍。
