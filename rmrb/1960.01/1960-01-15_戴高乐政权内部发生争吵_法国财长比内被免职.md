Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 13th: The French Presidential Palace issued a public announcement tonight stating that Finance Minister Pinay has been dismissed at the request of Prime Minister Debré, and the vacancy will be filled by the Governor of the Bank of France, Baumgartner.

According to reports in the local newspapers, Pinay was dismissed for opposing the policies of the Debré government. Prior to his dismissal, President de Gaulle had negotiated with him twice within 24 hours, requesting that he either accept the position of Minister of State without real power or resign voluntarily, but Pinay refused both. Pinay's dismissal exposes the significant internal divisions within the French government after de Gaulle came to power, as well as the deepening class contradictions in France. Observers here point out that the Debré government, seeing the growing dissatisfaction of the French people with the financial and economic policies that harm the people's interests, is attempting to shift the responsibility for implementing these policies onto Pinay, using Pinay as a scapegoat to alleviate popular discontent. In addition, in order to paralyze and divide the struggle of the working class, the Debré government recently drafted a law attempting to bring so-called "worker representatives" into the management of enterprises as a facade, in order to strengthen the exploitation of workers under the guise of "labor-management cooperation."

The traditional French monopoly groups that supported Pinay had exerted pressure on the government. After the news of the falling out between Pinay and de Gaulle-Debré spread, the stocks of some large companies on the Paris stock market immediately fell by 5% or even more. "L'Aurore" and "Le Figaro," controlled by traditional monopoly groups, successively published articles expressing support for Pinay. The President of the French Chamber of Commerce also wrote to Debré, saying that if the government changed Pinay's policies, it would bear the consequences.

    戴高乐政权内部发生争吵
    法国财长比内被免职
    据新华社巴黎13日电　法国总统府今天晚上发表公报说，在总理德勃雷要求下，财政部长比内已经被免除职务，遗缺将由法兰西银行总裁波姆加纳填补。
    据这里报纸报道，比内是由于反对德勃雷政府的政策而被免职的。在他被免职之前，总统戴高乐曾经在二十四小时内两次同他谈判，要求他改任没有实际权力的国务部长或者自动辞职，但是比内都拒绝了。比内的被免职，暴露了戴高乐上台后法国政府内部的重大分歧。以及法国阶级矛盾的加深，据这里的观察家指出，德勃雷政府看到法国人民对损害人民利益的财政经济政策日益不满，企图把执行这种政策的责任推在比内身上，用牺牲比内的办法来缓和人民的不满情绪。此外，德勃雷政府为了麻痹和分化工人阶级的斗争，最近还起草了一个法律，企图把所谓“工人代表”拉到企业的管理部门去装扮门面，以便在“劳资合作”的幌子下加强对工人的剥削。
    支持比内的法国传统垄断集团曾经对政府施行压力。在比内和戴高乐—德勃雷闹翻的消息传出后，巴黎股票市场中一些大公司的股票立即下跌了5％甚至更多，受传统垄断集团控制的“震旦报”和“费加罗报”都接连发表文章，表示支持比内。法国商会主席还写信给德勃雷说，如果政府改变比内的政策，就要承担后果。
