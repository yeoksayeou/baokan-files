Xinhua News Agency dispatch: World public opinion continues to condemn the anti-Semitic provocations recently incited by fascists in many Western countries, and firmly demands that these barbaric atrocities be stopped.

The Anti-Fascist Resistance Fighters Committee of the German Democratic Republic issued an open letter regarding the open acts of racial discrimination in West Germany and West Berlin.

The letter pointed out that the principles of the Potsdam Agreement – requiring the elimination of militarism and Nazism – have not been realized in West Germany and West Berlin. Today, it is very clear that due to the policies pursued by the Adenauer government, West Germany has become the main and dangerous center for the development of a new fascism. The letter said: "The conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is more urgent than ever in order to eliminate forever the threat of West German aggressive militarism."

The Polish people have held rallies protesting the anti-Semitic crimes of West German fascists. At a mass rally held at the Rozdzieński Cotton Mill, former prisoners of Hitler's concentration camps sternly condemned the activities of the remnants of Hitlerism in West Germany. The participants unanimously adopted a resolution protesting the provocative acts of West German fascists and demanding the immediate cessation of the criminal activities of fascist organizations and the severe punishment of the ringleaders.

Mass protest rallies were also held in the "Szombierki", "Lagiewniki", "Bytom" mines and "Bobrek" metallurgical plant, as well as many other enterprises in Silesia.

The "People's Tribune" published an article entitled "They Have Learned Nothing," stating that the anti-Semitic movement was born out of the criminal activities of German fascism. The commentary emphasized that further development of the situation must be stopped as soon as possible.

The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Anti-Fascist Fighters Union strongly protested the recent anti-Semitic provocations in the world at a meeting.

In a resolution submitted to West German Chancellor Adenauer, the Presidium stated that Czech and Slovak anti-fascist fighters were extremely indignant at the extent of the fascist provocations and the West German authorities' indulgence of the perpetrators of these provocations.

The resolution stated that Czech and Slovak anti-fascist fighters protested against the West German authorities' support for former Nazi henchmen – Hitler generals, judges, SS officers, and revanchists – and demanded that they be removed from social life and punished accordingly.

The "Malay Mail" of Malaya published an editorial on the 5th, stating that "whether it is against Jews or any other nation, racial hatred is a harmful and rapidly growing weed that must be completely eradicated."

The British Peace Committee and the British Veterans for Peace Movement jointly held a mass protest rally in London on the afternoon of the 9th. The more than two hundred people who attended the meeting unanimously passed a resolution protesting the West German authorities' persecution of individuals and organizations who condemned anti-Semitic atrocities, the trial of West German peace movement leaders in Düsseldorf, and the attempt to ban the Association of Victims of Nazism. The resolution demanded that the Adenauer government immediately take measures to stop all these actions and replace former Nazis who held important positions in the government, economy, and other departments. After the meeting, they marched to the West German embassy, asking it to forward the resolution to the Bonn government.

In West Germany, the West German Metalworkers' Union, which has 1.76 million members, demanded that the Bonn authorities take strong measures to stop the current "wave of Nazi atrocities."

Many West German newspapers condemned the Bonn government's connivance at the resurgence of fascist activities in West Germany. The "Stuttgarter Zeitung" pointed out in an editorial that West German Interior Minister Schröder "is accustomed to looking to the left" and not long ago attempted to declare the "Association of Victims of Nazism" illegal, while for many years turning a blind eye to the situation where fascist "poisonous flowers are in full bloom." The newspaper also criticized the authorities for failing to take any measures to stop the widespread circulation of fascist publications in West Germany.

The "Frankfurter Rundschau" accused the Adenauer government of trying to cover up the real wirepullers behind the current anti-Semitic wave. The newspaper believes that the real masterminds of the anti-Semitic activities should be found in the Bonn government leadership.

The National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA issued a statement signed by twenty-one religious leaders condemning anti-Semitic atrocities. The statement called on all people of goodwill to oppose these illegal acts and to expose those who promote Nazi racism and deprive them of the opportunity to influence young people.

The Israeli Organization of Resistance Fighters and Victims of Nazism held a mass rally on the streets of Tel Aviv on the evening of the 9th to protest the revival of Hitlerism and anti-Semitism in West Germany. The mass rally enthusiastically responded to the call for the realization of anti-fascist unity and advocated the immediate cancellation of the arms deal between the Israeli Ben-Gurion government and the West German authorities.

    西德已经成为法西斯复活的温床
    世界舆论继续谴责法西斯反犹挑衅
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：世界公众舆论继续谴责最近在西方许多国家里法西斯分子所掀起的反犹太人的挑衅活动，并坚决要求制止这种野蛮的暴行。
    德意志民主共和国反法西斯抵抗战士委员会就在西德和西柏林出现的公开的种族歧视活动发表了一封公开信。
    这封信指出，西德和西柏林并没有实现波茨坦协定的原则——要求消灭军国主义和纳粹主义。今天这种情况就十分清楚了，由于阿登纳政府奉行的政策，西德已经成为新的法西斯发展的主要危险中心。这封信说：“缔结对德和约比以前任何时候都更为迫切，以便永远消灭西德的侵略性的军国主义的威胁。”
    波兰人民纷纷举行集会，抗议西德法西斯分子的反犹太人的罪恶活动。在罗兹捷尔任斯基棉织厂举行的群众大会上，前希特勒集中营的囚犯们严正地谴责了西德希特勒主义余孽的活动。会议参加者一致通过决议，抗议西德法西斯分子的挑衅行为，并要求立即制止法西斯组织的罪恶活动，严厉惩办首恶分子。
    在“肖姆伯基”、“拉格夫尼基”、“贝托姆”矿井和“博布雷克”冶金工厂以及西里西亚的其他许多企业中，也都举行了群众抗议大会。
      “人民论坛报”以“他们没有吸取什么教训”为题发表文章说，反犹运动是在德国法西斯主义的罪恶活动的基础上产生的。评论强调指出，必须趁早制止事态的进一步发展。
    捷克斯洛伐克反法西斯战士联盟中央委员会主席团在一次会议上，强烈抗议世界上最近发生的反犹太挑衅活动。
    主席团在一项提交给德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳的决议中说，捷克和斯洛伐克的反法西斯战士对法西斯挑衅的程度和西德当局纵容这些挑衅活动的肇事者的做法极为愤慨。
    决议说，捷克和斯洛伐克的反法西斯战士抗议西德当局给前纳粹政权的帮凶——希特勒将领、法官、党卫军以及复仇主义者以支持，并且要求把他们从社会生活中清除出去，使他们受到应有的惩罚。
    马来亚的“马来亚邮报”在5日发表社论说，“不管是反对犹太人还是反对任何其他民族，种族仇恨是一种有害的和成长迅速的杂草，必须彻底铲除。”
    英国和平委员会和英国退伍军人保卫和平运动9日下午在伦敦联合举行了一次群众性的抗议集会。参加会议的两百多人一致通过一项决议，抗议西德当局对那些斥责反犹暴行的个人和组织的迫害，在杜塞尔多夫对西德和平运动领袖进行的审讯以及想禁止受纳粹之害者协会的企图。决议要求阿登纳政府立即采取措施停止这一切行为，并且在政府、经济等部门中撤换那些担任重要职位的前纳粹分子。会后，他们列队前往西德大使馆，要它把这项决议转交给波恩政府。
    在西德，拥有一百七十六万会员的西德五金工人工会要求波恩当局采取有力措施来制止目前这种“纳粹恶行的浪潮”。
    不少西德报纸谴责波恩政府纵容法西斯活动在西德重新抬头。“斯图加特日报”在社论中指出，西德内政部长施罗德“惯于把视线朝向左面”，就在不久前还企图宣布“受纳粹之害者协会”为非法，而多年来眼看着法西斯“毒花盛开”的情况却采取放任的态度。这家报纸还指责官方不采取任何措施阻止法西斯刊物在西德境内广泛流传。
    “法兰克福评论报”指责阿登纳政府力图替这次反犹浪潮幕后真正的牵线人进行遮掩。这家报纸认为，反犹活动的真正主谋者应当到波恩政府领导机构中去找。
    美国教会全国委员会发表了由二十一名宗教领袖签署的一项声明，谴责反犹暴行。声明要求一切心地善良的人都来反对这种非法行为，并且要求揭露那些宣扬纳粹种族主义的人和剥夺他们影响青年的机会。
    以色列抵抗运动战士和纳粹主义受害者组织9日晚间在特拉维夫的大街上举行了一次群众大会，抗议希特勒主义和反犹太主义疫疠在西德复活。群众大会热烈响应关于实现反法西斯团结的号召，主张立即撤销以色列本—古里安政府同西德当局的军火交易。
