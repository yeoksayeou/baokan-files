This newspaper, Hangzhou, 11th: Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, is establishing small farms everywhere, as a base for guiding agricultural production and promoting advanced technologies and production-increasing measures. These small farms are also playing a locomotive role in the current cultivation and management of winter crops throughout the county.

At present, Yuyao County has established 3,156 small farms, with 132,630 mu of land, accounting for 18.5% of the county's total winter crop area. These small farms are generally managed by the Party branch secretary of each production team. Communes and brigades have also established central small farms as the core for directing other small farms and large fields. Before promoting any advanced production technology or production-increasing measure, leading cadres of communes, brigades, and production teams generally first work together with commune members in the small farms to set an example, and then hold on-site meetings to promote it. These small farms also conduct cutting-edge experiments, vigorously breed fine varieties, actively carry out technological innovations aimed at improving labor productivity, and often send people out to teach techniques and introduce experiences.

In the past month or so, 2,185 on-site meetings have been held in these small farms in Yuyao County, which has greatly promoted the overall leap forward of winter crops in the county's large fields. Some production teams in Linshan Commune had different opinions when discussing the density specifications for rapeseed planting this year. The branch advocated appropriately increasing the density. Some individuals believed that this would hinder ventilation and light transmission, affecting production, and advocated planting sparsely. After learning about this situation, the commune Party committee tested six different forms of sowing methods in the commune's small farm and organized cadres and commune members' representatives from various production teams to visit. After on-the-spot comparison and debate, everyone finally agreed that as long as the method is appropriate, dense planting will neither hinder ventilation nor affect light transmission. After the meeting, all production teams carried out reasonable close planting according to the example of the commune's small farm. The density of rapeseed in the commune's large fields generally reached 18,000 to 20,000 plants per mu. After planting, the commune's small farm discovered that there were rapeseed mosaic virus and rapeseed aphids. The commune Party committee gathered cadres from various production teams to inspect and effectively overcame the paralysis of some cadres and commune members who thought "there are no pests and diseases in winter." The next day, the entire commune carried out a general prevention and control measure on all rapeseed fields. Before the three comprehensive cultivations of winter crops, the Lubu Commune first set a high standard in the small farms at all levels, and then organized visits and promoted them. Cadres and commune members generally reflected that this method was good.

The widespread establishment of small farms in Yuyao County is a new development in massively running experimental fields. Since 1958, cadres at all levels throughout the county have gone to the fields and engaged in experiments, and a large number of experimental fields have emerged, which has greatly promoted agricultural production. However, due to the small area of the experimental fields and the small number of people, there are certain limitations in taking some advanced measures for demonstration and promotion. Small farms have a concentrated leadership force, a large area, and are convenient for carrying out various comparative experiments. Their role in this regard exceeds that of experimental fields and is more convincing than experimental fields. Before the autumn harvest last year, Yuyao County already had 105 small farms. The average yield per unit area of wheat, rapeseed, and early rice in these farms was generally 20% to 30% higher than that of the surrounding production teams. Therefore, small farms have a high reputation among the masses. At the beginning of winter planting, the Linshan Brigade of Linshan Commune first used the small farm as a base for leading production to direct large fields and drive large fields, and the effect was very good. The winter crops of the entire brigade were planted early, managed well, and all the seedlings were strong and healthy. The brigade cadres said: "Small farms are a treasure, and they are indispensable for leading production." After discovering this, the Yuyao County Party Committee believed that this was a very good mass line working method, which could further solve the fundamental problems of combining leadership with the masses, combining politics with technology, and leading the whole area from the parts in leading agricultural production. It was decided to promote it throughout the county.

    全县建立小农场三千多个占冬种面积将近五分之一
    大办试验田的新发展
    余姚县遍建各级小农场
    成为领导农业生产推广先进技术和增产措施的基地
    本报杭州11日电　浙江省余姚县各地大办小农场，作为领导农业生产，推广先进技术和增产措施的基地。这些小农场在当前全县冬种作物的培育管理中，也发挥了火车头的作用。
    目前余姚县已经办起了三千一百五十六个小农场，拥有土地十三万二千六百三十亩；占全县冬种作物总面积的18．5％。这些小农场在全县各生产队，一般都由党支部书记兼任场长。公社和大队还建立了中心小农场，作为指挥其他小农场和大田的核心。各公社、大队和生产队的领导干部，在推进每项先进的生产技术或增产措施以前，大都首先在小农场里和社员一起作出样子，然后召开现场会议推广。这些小农场还进行尖端试验，大力繁育良种，积极开展以提高劳动生产率为目的的技术革新，并且经常派人出去传授技术、介绍经验。
    一个多月来，在余姚县的这些小农场里已召开了二千一百八十五次现场会议，对全县冬种作物大田全面跃进起了很大的推动作用。临山公社有一些生产队在讨论今年油菜密植规格时意见不一。支部主张适当提高密植程度。有个别人认为这样种会妨碍通风、透光、影响生产，主张种稀一些。公社党委了解这一情况后，就在公社的小农场里试验了六种不同形式的播种方法，组织各个生产队的干部和社员代表去参观。经过实地比较和辩论，最后大家一致同意：只要方法得当，密植既不会妨碍通风，也不致影响透光。会后各生产队都按照公社小农场的样子进行合理密植，全公社大田油菜密植程度普遍达到一万八千株到二万株。种下以后，公社小农场发现有油菜毒素病和油虫为害。公社党委就召集各生产队干部前来察看，有效地克服了部分干部和社员认为“冬天无病虫”的麻痹思想。第二天，全公社就对全部油菜田普遍进行了一次防治。陆埠公社在三次全面培育冬种作物以前，都先在各级小农场中，按照高标准做好样子，然后组织参观，进行推广。干部和社员普遍反映这个法子好。
    余姚县普遍建立小农场，是大搞试验田的新发展。1958年来，全县各级干部人人下田间，个个搞试验，出现了大批试验田，这对农业生产起了巨大促进作用。但是，由于试验田的面积小，人手少，在采取一些先进措施进行示范推广时，有一定的局限性。小农场领导力量集中，面积大，便于进行多种多样的对比试验，在这方面的作用就超过了试验田，比试验田更有说服力。去年秋收以前，余姚县已有小农场一百零五个。这些农场的大、小麦，油菜和早稻的平均单位产量，普遍比周围的生产队高出20％到30％。因此，小农场在群众中威信很高。冬种开始时，临山公社临山大队首先运用小农场，作为领导生产的基地来指挥大田，带动大田，效果很好。全大队冬种作物种得早、管得好、丘丘全苗、壮苗。大队干部们说：“小农场是个宝，领导生产少不了。”余姚县委发现后，认为这是一条很好的群众路线工作方法，能进一步解决领导与群众结合，政治与技术结合，以点带面这些领导农业生产的根本问题，决定在全县推广。
