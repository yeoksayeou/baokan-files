Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 8th: In the first week of the new year, the broad masses of workers in the German Democratic Republic have launched a vigorous labor competition, striving to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule.

The characteristics of this year's labor competition on the industrial front are: a grand scale and rapid development. In mid-December 1959, the state-owned Karl Marx Meter and Instrument Factory in Magdeburg, after completing its annual production tasks, first challenged workers in industrial, mining, transportation, agricultural, and forestry enterprises across the country to complete the 1960 (the second year of the Seven-Year Plan) production tasks ahead of schedule and comprehensively. Immediately afterwards, dozens of factories responded. Once the new year began, even more units responded, extending to almost all industrial sectors, including mining, metallurgy, chemicals, machinery, electrical engineering, shipbuilding, railways, construction and building materials, light industry, and the workers of some state-owned farms. The famous Bitterfeld Electrochemical Combine had 9,000 workers engaged in the socialist labor competition just a few days into the new year. Nearly 40% of the workers at the Karl Marx Stadt Cotton Textile Machinery Factory participated in the competition for the honorary title of "Socialist Labor Team."

Comprehensively and evenly completing the production plan is a slogan that has received special attention in this year's labor competition. Administrative leaders and trade union organizations of many factories and mines have jointly discussed and formulated specific measures with workers to realize this slogan. To avoid the phenomenon of being relaxed at the beginning and tight at the end, many units have stipulated specific targets for completing about a quarter of the annual task in the first quarter. Many units have set May 8th, the 15th anniversary of the liberation, as the first stage of the competition, and workers are striving to complete 35% of this year's plan by this great anti-fascist victory day.

In comprehensively and evenly completing the production plan, improving product quality is a key focus of the competition. Almost every challenge, response, or guarantee in the labor competition contains suggestions or measures to improve product quality. The "Wilhelm Pieck" Artificial Fiber Factory plans to reach world standards in the production of chemical fibers by March this year. The Greiz Paper Mill guarantees that 80% of its products will be of first-class quality this year. Workers at the Halle Water Pump Factory decided to make three types of water pumps excellent products this year.

Workers in many factories and mines have achieved good results as soon as the new year began. Borna lignite miners exceeded their excavation plan by 42% in the three days from January 1st to 3rd, and exceeded their coal mining plan by 27%. Workers at the Television Electrode Factory in Oberschöneweide, Berlin, had a victory on the first day, exceeding their daily production task by about one-eighth. Workers at the No. 1 open-hearth furnace of the Wilhelm Florin Steel Plant in Hennigsdorf have overproduced 129 tons of high-quality steel in the first five days of this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 7th: The broad masses of workers in Bulgarian industrial and mining enterprises have begun their labor in 1960 with a heroic attitude. To complete and overfulfill the task of increasing this year's industrial output value by 15.2%, they have created brilliant achievements in the first few days of the new year.

Miners are at the forefront of the leap forward. Miners in Dimitrovgrad completed 107% of their production plan in the first two days of this year. In these two days, miners at the "Milenov" mine excavated more than 3,400 tons of coal than planned, "Torbushen" mine - more than 340 tons, "Dimitrov" mine - more than 350 tons, "Nankov" mine - more than 150 tons.

The oil processing enterprises in Ruse, a major city in northern Bulgaria, also reported the first production victory of the year: in the first four days of this year, all the employees of the enterprise completed 103% of the production plan. They are determined to produce more than 29% more products this year than last year.

The country's largest "Volcano" cement plant, after overfulfilling last year's leap forward plan, immediately began a new leap forward: increasing this year's production by 27% compared to last year. In the first three days of this year, the employees of this factory produced 280 tons more cement and 500 square meters more of concrete roofing panels than originally planned. Employees of the "Saymov" cement plant in Pleven also overproduced 100 tons of cement in the first four days of this year.

Employees of the "Kolarov" thermal power plant in Burgas, a major coastal city in eastern Bulgaria, produced more than 100,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity on January 1, completing more than 145% of the plan. Immediately afterwards, they overfulfilled their second day's production plan by more than 59%.

In the "Maritsa" textile factory in Plovdiv, one of the country's largest textile industrial centers, the workers are very enthusiastic. They produced 3,200 meters more cloth in the two days of January 2nd and 3rd than originally planned. (Attached picture)

    德意志民主共和国广大职工新年大搞劳动竞赛
    争取全面均衡提前完成今年生产计划
    保加利亚工矿企业开始新的跃进矿工走在前列
    新华社柏林8日电　在新年的第一周，德意志民主共和国的广大职工轰轰烈烈地展开了劳动竞赛，争取提前完成今年的生产计划。
    今年工业战线上的劳动竞赛的特色是：声势浩大，开展迅速。在1959年12月中旬，马格德堡的国营卡尔·马克思量具仪表厂在完成全年生产任务后，首先向全国工矿、交通、农林各企业的职工提出提前和全面完成1960年（七年计划第二年）生产任务的挑战。紧接着就有几十个工厂应战。新年一过，应战的单位更多，几乎扩展到了所有的工业部门，其中包括采矿、冶金、化学、机械、电机、造船、铁路、建筑和建筑材料、轻工业等各行各业的职工，以及一些国营农场的工人。著名的比特菲尔德的电气化学联合企业在新年刚过几天，就有九千名工人投入社会主义劳动竞赛。卡尔·马克思斯塔特棉纺机制造厂有近40％的工人参加了争取“社会主义劳动队”光荣称号的竞赛。
    全面均衡完成生产计划，是今年劳动竞赛中特别受到人们注意的口号。许多厂矿企业的行政领导和工会组织同职工共同商量拟订了实现这个口号的具体措施。为了避免前松后紧的现象，许多单位规定了第一季度就要完成全年任务四分之一左右的具体指标。有不少单位把今年5月8日——解放十五周年的纪念日做为竞赛的第一个阶段，工人们争取到这个伟大的反法西斯胜利日时要完成今年计划的35％。
    在全面均衡完成生产计划中，提高产品质量又是竞赛中的重点。几乎每一份劳动竞赛的挑战、应战或保证书中，都有关于提高产品质量的建议或措施。“威廉·皮克”人造纤维工厂计划到今年3月份就在化学纤维的生产上达到世界水平。格赖次造纸厂保证今年有80％的产品是一级质量。哈雷水泵厂工人决定，要在今年使三种水泵成为优等品。
    许多厂矿的工人在新年刚刚降临的时候就做出了良好的成绩。波尔那褐煤工人在1月1日到3日的三天中超额42％完成掘进计划；并超额27％完成采煤计划。柏林奥伯舍内瓦尔德的电视机电极厂的工人，在头一天就打了个胜仗：超额约八分之一完成了全天的生产任务。赫宁斯多夫的威廉·弗洛林钢厂第一号平炉的工人，在今年头五天中已超额生产了一百二十九吨优质钢。
    新华社索非亚7日电　保加利亚各工矿企业的广大职工以英雄的姿态开始了1960年的劳动。为了完成和超额完成使今年的工业产值增长15．2％的任务，他们在新年刚开始的几天中就创造出了辉煌的成绩。
    矿工走在跃进队伍的前列。季米特洛夫市的矿工们在今年头两天中就完成了生产计划的107％。在这两天里，“米列诺夫”矿井的矿工们比原计划多挖了三千四百多吨煤，“托尔布兴”矿井——三百四十多吨，“季米特洛夫”矿井——三百五十多吨，“楠科夫”矿井——一百五十多吨。
    保加利亚北部重镇鲁西市的石油加工企业，也传来了今年的第一个生产捷报：在今年头四天里，全企业职工完成了生产计划的103％。他们决心要在今年生产出比去年多29％以上的产品。
    全国最大的“火山”水泥厂，在超额完成去年的跃进计划之后，紧接着又开始了新的跃进：使今年的生产比去年增长27％。在今年的头三天中，这个厂的职工们就比原计划多生产了二百八十吨水泥、五百平方米混凝土屋顶板。普列文市的“萨伊莫夫”水泥厂的职工也在今年头四天中超计划生产了一百吨水泥。
    保加利亚东部沿海重镇布加斯市的“科拉罗夫”火电站的职工在1月1日这一天生产了十万度以上的电力，完成了计划的145％以上。紧接着，他们又超额59％以上完成了今年第二天的生产计划。
    在全国最大的纺织工业中心之一——普罗夫迪夫市的“马里查”纺织工厂，工人们的干劲很大。他们在1月2日、3日两天内生产的布，比原计划多三千二百米。（附图片）
