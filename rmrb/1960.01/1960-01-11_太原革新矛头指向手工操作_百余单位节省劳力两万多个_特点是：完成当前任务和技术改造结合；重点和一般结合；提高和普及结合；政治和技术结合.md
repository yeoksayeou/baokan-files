Taiyuan, January 10th (reporter from this newspaper) – The technical innovation and technical revolution movement, centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, on the industrial front in Taiyuan City, has achieved brilliant results. From October 1st to the end of last year, the city manufactured more than 31,000 units (sets, pieces) of various indigenous and foreign machines. One hundred and forty-two types of work have broken away from manual operation, completely or basically realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization; saving 24,000 laborers and steadily increasing labor productivity.

At the start of the movement, a clear and loud slogan was put forward: "Ask for labor from innovation," "Increase production without increasing personnel." Wherever there was labor potential, people innovated there. Because the Party committees at all levels led with a plan, organization, specific goals and clear direction, the movement was more extensive and profound than previous technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and developed rapidly and vigorously from the start. All enterprises, from leading cadres to workers and technicians, to cooks, from production workshops to auxiliary departments and service departments, were all swept into the torrent of the movement. Truly everyone, everything, and everywhere was making great efforts in innovation. All participants in the innovation movement focused on manual operations, heavy manual labor, and all departments that employed a large number of people.

As a result of vigorously carrying out technical innovation, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in various production units has been greatly improved, and the proportion of manual operations is gradually decreasing. According to statistics from 117 units in the city, out of 1,353 types of work, only 338 had adopted mechanical operation over the years. However, after only three months of technical innovation and technical revolution, 126 units manufactured more than 31,000 units (sets, pieces) of various indigenous and foreign equipment, tools, loading, unloading, crushing and transportation machinery. One hundred and forty-two types of work have completely or basically broken away from manual operation, realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization. Many enterprises have taken the initiative to provide personnel to support newly established enterprises or newly added departments. Based on calculations from 147 units in the city, the labor saved by mechanization in three months reached 17,000 people, and the labor saved by adjusting labor organization was 7,000 people. The two items totaled 24,000 laborers, accounting for about 50% of the city's plan for saving labor this winter and next spring. Labor productivity also rose sharply. In November, the city's overall labor productivity increased by 15.88% compared to October. In December, the overall labor productivity of production factories and mines increased by more than 15% compared to November. Forty-nine enterprises in the city have achieved "increased production without increasing personnel," with production targets increasing by 50% to 300%.

The characteristics of this movement are, first, the combination of completing current tasks with technological transformation. The result of mechanization and semi-mechanization not only enabled enterprises to complete their 1959 production plans ahead of schedule and beyond targets in the case of insufficient manpower, but also armed certain production departments that had long relied on manual operations with machinery, greatly improving the technical level of these departments and fundamentally changing their production outlook. Second, the combination of key innovation and general innovation. This innovation not only targeted key production areas, but many units also carried out full-line innovation, transforming scattered and disjointed reform machinery into mechanized and semi-mechanized production lines, thereby ensuring a comprehensive improvement in technical level and better leveraging the efficiency of machinery. After the Third Team of the Third Work Area of the Taiyuan Municipal Engineering Company carried out a complete set of innovations, the efficiency of the old machinery and new tools in concrete operations alone increased by 5% compared to dispersed use. Third, the combination of improvement and popularization. During the movement, enterprises organized various types of practice, competitions and performances. Newly created or reformed tools, equipment or operational experience could be quickly promoted. Especially after competition performances, mutual exchanges, and learning from each other's strengths, many advanced technical experiences were further enriched and improved, and many tools and machines were more perfected. Fourth, the combination of mass inventions and systematic large-scale technical transformation. While the masses were vigorously engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution, using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to manufacture various machines, enterprises also seized the opportunity to transform major equipment. In particular, enterprises with relatively high degrees of mechanization, while leading the masses to eliminate manual operations, also took measures to develop towards automation, high speed and comprehensiveness, so that the technical level of enterprises could increase step by step. In addition, through innovative practices, the broad masses of workers were further encouraged to liberate their minds, establish communist ambitions. The idea of learning from the advanced and striving for the upstream has been universally strengthened. The communist style of mutual cooperation and mutual assistance has been greatly improved, making it a common practice to give convenience to others and leave difficulties to oneself. The enthusiasm for learning and studying technology has been universally high. This ideological liberation, the increase in drive, and the technical study have vigorously promoted the healthy development of the innovation movement. Therefore, another characteristic of this movement is the combination of politics and technology.

This year, starting from January 1st, the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee, based on the achievements already made, is advancing victoriously and launching a second campaign, which will last until the end of February. The main attack direction remains: manual operations and heavy manual labor. At the same time, it is necessary to carefully organize the identification and finalization of mechanical equipment, standardize experience, and mechanize the entire production line. Broadly establish mechanization pacesetters in various industries and types of work. For types of work with a high degree of mechanization, we require a large step towards automation and semi-automation. The city's workers are working hard, determined to achieve greater victories in the second campaign. (Attached picture)

    太原革新矛头指向手工操作
    百余单位节省劳力两万多个
    特点是：完成当前任务和技术改造结合；重点和一般结合；提高和普及结合；政治和技术结合
    本报太原10日电　太原市工业战线，以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，获得了辉煌成果。从去年10月1日到年底，全市已制造各种土、洋机械三万一千多台（套、件），有一百四十二个工种，摆脱了手工操作，完全或基本实现了机械化、半机械化；节约劳动力两万四千人，劳动生产率节节上升。
    运动一开始，就提出了明确而又响亮的口号：“向革新要劳力”，“增产不增人”。哪里有劳动潜力，人们就革新到哪里。由于各级党委领导有计划、有组织、目标具体、方向明确，所以一开始，就比以往的技术革新和技术革命运动广泛、深刻，来势勇猛，发展迅速，各企业从领导干部到工人、技术人员，直到炊事员，从生产车间到辅助部门、服务部门，统统卷入了运动的激流。真是人人、事事、处处都在大闹革新。所有参加革新的人，矛头又重点指向手工操作、笨重体力劳动，以及一切占人较多的部门。
    大搞技术革新的结果，各个生产单位的机械化、半机械化程度是大大提高了，手工操作的比重在日渐缩小。据全市一百一十七个单位统计，一千三百五十三个工种中，几年来，采用机械操作的只有三百三十八个工种。可是经过短短三个月的技术革新和技术革命运动，一百二十六个单位，制造各种土洋设备、工具以及装卸、粉碎、运输机械三万一千余台（套、件）。有一百四十二个工种，完全或基本摆脱了手工操作，实现了机械化、半机械化。许多企业主动拿出人来支援新建企业或新增加的部门。以全市一百四十七个单位计算，三个月实现机械化节约的劳力达一万七千人，调整劳动组织节约劳动力七千人，两项合计，共节约了二万四千个劳动力。占全市去冬今春节约劳动力计划的50％左右。劳动生产率，也是直线上升。11月份，全市全员劳动生产率比10月份提高15．88％。12月份生产厂矿全员劳动生产率，又比11月份增长15％以上。全市已有四十九个企业，做到“增产不增人”，生产指标提高半倍到三倍。
    这次运动的特点，首先是完成当前任务和技术改造相结合。机械化、半机械化的结果，不仅使各企业在人力不足的情况下，提前超额完成了1959年的生产计划，而且用机械武装了某些长期手工操作的生产部门，使这些部门的技术水平大大提高一步，生产面貌得到根本性的改变。其次是重点革新和一般革新相结合。这次革新，不仅针对生产关键，而且有不少单位，进行了全线革新。变零星的、互不衔接的改革机具为机械化、半机械化一条龙，从而保证了技术水平的全面提高，更好地发挥了机械的使用效率。太原市市政工程公司三工区三队，大搞革新一条龙配套以后，仅混凝土作业一项，旧有机械和新工具的效率，就比分散使用提高5％。第三，提高和普及相结合。在运动当中，各企业都组织了各种类型的练武、比武、表演。新创造或改革的工具、设备或操作经验，很快就能推广出去。特别是经过比武表演，相互交流，取长补短之后，使许多先进技术经验更加充实、提高，许多工具、机械更加完善。第四，群众性的创造发明和系统的大型技术改造相结合。在群众大搞技术革新和技术革命，用土、洋相结合的办法制造各种机械的同时，各企业也抓紧了对重大设备的改造。特别是本来机械化程度就比较高的企业，一面领导群众消灭手工操作，一面采取措施，向自动化、高速化、综合化方向发展。使企业技术水平，层层加码，步步提高。此外，通过革新实践进一步促进了广大职工解放思想，树立了共产主义雄心壮志。学先进争上游的思想，普遍增强。互相协作，互相帮助的共产主义风格大大提高，把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己，已成为风气。学习和钻研技术的热情普遍高涨。这种思想上的解放，干劲的提高，技术上的钻研，又有力地推进了革新运动健康发展。因此这次运动的另一特点又是政治和技术相结合。
    今年，从1月1日起，中共太原市委又在已得的成绩基础上，乘胜猛进，发动了第二个战役，时间是到2月底。确定主攻方向，仍然是：手工操作和笨重体力劳动。同时要认真组织机械设备的鉴定、定型，经验成套，机械化一条龙。广树各行业、各工种的机械化标兵。对机械化程度较高的工种，要求大踏步向自动化、半自动化方向进军。全市职工正在紧张奋战，决心在第二次战役中，取得更大的胜利。（附图片）
