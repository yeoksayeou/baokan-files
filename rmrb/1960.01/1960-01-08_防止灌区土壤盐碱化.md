    Preventing Soil Salinization in Irrigation Areas
    Irrigation Research Institute, Academy of Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Sciences
    With the increasing development of water conservancy construction, tremendous achievements have been made throughout the country in preventing soil salinization and improving saline-alkali land. However, in some areas, due to unreasonable irrigation and cultivation measures, the groundwater level has risen to varying degrees, resulting in partial soil salinization. Some people fail to see the enormous production increase brought about by the hundreds of millions of mu of newly added irrigation areas in our country, and fail to see the tens of millions of mu of old saline-alkali land that we have already improved and utilized. Instead, they exaggerate and distort the temporary and localized soil salinization problems that are currently occurring, saying that "soil salinization is the result of water conservancy construction," that "water conservancy has become a water disaster," and even attempt to negate the principle of "emphasizing storage." This is obviously absurd.
    In arid, semi-arid, and coastal areas, groundwater and soil contain a certain amount of soluble salts. When the groundwater rises to a certain depth below the surface, the soluble salts in the groundwater and subsoil rapidly accumulate towards the surface due to capillary action in the soil and strong surface evaporation, causing the salt content of the cultivated layer to exceed the level that crops can tolerate. This is what is commonly referred to as "secondary soil salinization in irrigation areas."
    Soil salinization in irrigation areas has both internal and external causes. External causes can also be said to be man-made factors. Practice has proven that man-made factors are dominant.
    Although secondary soil salinization is closely related to irrigation, the salt and alkali in the soil move with the movement of soil moisture. Irrigation can not only improve saline-alkali land (washing salt, pressing salt, and diluting soil salt content), but also, by adopting correct irrigation techniques and mastering the movement of soil water, can effectively prevent soil salinization. Thinking that salinization is an inevitable result of irrigation, worrying about soil salinization and daring not to develop irrigation, or even stopping irrigation and "returning water to drought," are all "throwing the baby out with the bathwater" ideas and are incorrect.
    Since soil salinization "comes with water," our approach is to make it "go away with water." The principle of "prevention first, combining prevention and treatment, taking water as the key, and comprehensive management" proposed at the National Saline-Alkali Soil Prevention and Control Conference in November 1959 is completely correct. It gives us a powerful weapon to overcome soil salinization.
    To prevent secondary soil salinization, we should mainly focus on three key aspects: irrigation, drainage, and cultivation. Specifically, we must achieve systemization of engineering, rationalization of irrigation, planning of water use, and gardenization of irrigation areas.
    Systemization of Engineering
    In terms of irrigation systems, what is currently more urgent is to improve the canal system and carry out anti-seepage work on the canals. A complete canal system and necessary control structures should be established in the irrigation area. When constructing irrigation areas, in addition to building water diversion structures and large water conveyance canals, field canals should also be built. Generally speaking, the field canal system should have at least three levels: distribution canals for land sections (branch canals or farm canals), which draw water from large canals and distribute it to various plots; distribution canals for plots (capillary canals, which are temporary canals in mechanized farming areas), which transport water to the furrows in the farmland; and water conveyance furrows, which pour water into the ditches and ridges, finally completing the irrigation process.
    The standard for controlling surface water is to ensure that the stagnation time of standing water on farmland does not harm crop growth and high yield, and that the groundwater level, which is temporarily raised by the infiltration of standing water, does not affect the development of crop roots. After the rainy season, the groundwater should be able to quickly drop below the safe depth (the safe depth is the groundwater depth that does not cause soil salinization; in northern irrigation areas, it is generally 1.2-1.5 meters for clay soils and 1.5-2.0 meters for light soils). In autumn crop fields, standing water should be drained within one or two days after rain.
    The measure to control and lower the groundwater level is to dig drainage ditches. The depth of the drainage ditch should be such that the groundwater level in the section it controls is below the safe depth. According to experiments in northern irrigation areas, the depth of the last-level drainage ditch can generally be set at 1.5-2.5 meters, depending on the soil quality and groundwater quality. The greater the safe depth, the deeper the drainage ditch should be dug.
    Groundwater resources are abundant in northern irrigation areas of our country. We should use both well irrigation and canal irrigation in tandem. This is not only an important means of improving drought resistance, but also these water wells can actually play the role of "vertical drainage," effectively preventing the rise of groundwater. This is an ideal form of combining irrigation and drainage.
    Rationalization of Irrigation
    Adopting reasonable irrigation quotas and resolutely eliminating large-quota irrigation can prevent the rise of groundwater after irrigation and also save water to expand the irrigated area. At present, in quite a few areas, the actual irrigation quota is too large, generally above 50 cubic meters per mu, and large-scale flooding irrigation is even as high as 80 to 100 cubic meters, greatly exceeding the water retention capacity of the crop root activity layer (generally 60 to 80 centimeters for crops such as cotton and wheat). This amount of water is not only wasted in vain, causing the groundwater to rise, but also damages the soil structure, leaches away valuable nutrients in the soil, and lowers the soil temperature, which is detrimental to the current year's crop yield. For example, according to the results of our experiments on different irrigation methods for cotton in the People's Victory Canal irrigation area, the soil with a suitable irrigation quota contains one to five times more available nitrogen and phosphorus than that of large-scale flooding irrigation, the ground temperature is 2-4Â°C higher, and the soil porosity is about 10% higher, thus reducing the boll shedding rate by 10% to 15% and increasing the yield of seed cotton by 20 to 30 jin per mu.
    The practice of high-yield farmers and years of experimental research have proven that an irrigation quota of 30 to 40 cubic meters per mu is sufficient for dryland crops such as cotton and wheat. This quota can also ensure that the groundwater is not raised after irrigation.
    Planning of Water Use
    Planned water use is to make a scientific analysis and planned arrangement of all aspects of the irrigation process in advance, so that the irrigation work can be carried out in an orderly manner. Planned water use is a reflection and requirement of planned production in the irrigation work under the socialist system. Since 1954 (the second year after irrigation), the Qiliying People's Commune in the People's Victory Canal Irrigation Area of Henan has adhered to the planned water use of a small Jizhi canal (controlling an irrigation area of about 50,000 mu). It has not only ensured that crop yields have increased year after year, but also that water consumption has decreased year by year. In the six years of irrigation, the rising trend of groundwater has been basically curbed, and soil salinization has rarely occurred or expanded.
    Gardenization of Irrigation Areas
    Uneven land in the irrigation area will cause water accumulation in low-lying areas and salt return in high-lying areas after irrigation or rainfall. This is an important reason for the formation of salt spots in the irrigation area. We must vigorously carry out land leveling work, and at the same time do a good job in field engineering to achieve "flat land, straight ridges, rows of ridges and fields, canals that do not leak, and ridges that do not flood."
    Frequent plowing, harrowing, and weeding can cut off the capillary action of the soil, which can both conserve moisture and prevent salt return. Increasing the application of organic fertilizers, implementing crop rotation, and increasing green manure can improve the physical properties of the soil. Rational close planting, and appropriate intercropping of cultivated crops, reduce ground evaporation. All of these have a significant effect on preventing salinization.
    At the same time, within the irrigation area, we should pay great attention to the rational layout of crop planting. In dryland crop irrigation areas, avoid decentralized planting of rice. At the same time, vigorously carry out the greening work in the irrigation area, and build shelterbelts along canals, reservoirs, roads, and around irrigated areas. Dense forests not only reduce wind speed, improve the climate, increase air humidity, and reduce surface evaporation, but also their strong root systems absorb a large amount of groundwater, which can play the role of "biological drainage."
    In order to ensure agricultural high yield, in areas threatened by salinization, it is necessary to actively carry out mass observation and research work, and carry out fixed-point observation of groundwater and soil salt content universally and persistently. On this basis, grasp the occurrence and evolution law of soil salinization, further carry out the prediction of the occurrence and development of salinization, so that prevention and control work has greater initiative, and realize the task of "overcoming salinization in a short period of time."
