    Preventing Soil Salinization in Irrigation Areas
    Irrigation Research Institute, Academy of Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Sciences
    With the increasing development of water conservancy construction, tremendous achievements have been made throughout the country in preventing soil salinization and improving saline-alkali land. However, in some areas, due to unreasonable irrigation and cultivation measures, the groundwater level has risen to varying degrees, resulting in partial soil salinization. Some people fail to see the enormous production increase brought about by the hundreds of millions of mu of newly added irrigation areas in our country, and fail to see the tens of millions of mu of old saline-alkali land that we have already improved and utilized. Instead, they exaggerate and distort the temporary and localized soil salinization problems that are currently occurring, saying that "soil salinization is the result of water conservancy construction," that "water conservancy has become a water disaster," and even attempt to negate the principle of "emphasizing storage." This is obviously absurd.
    In arid, semi-arid, and coastal areas, groundwater and soil contain a certain amount of soluble salts. When the groundwater rises to a certain depth below the surface, the soluble salts in the groundwater and subsoil rapidly accumulate towards the surface due to capillary action in the soil and strong surface evaporation, causing the salt content of the cultivated layer to exceed the level that crops can tolerate. This is what is commonly referred to as "secondary soil salinization in irrigation areas."
    Soil salinization in irrigation areas has both internal and external causes. External causes can also be said to be man-made factors. Practice has proven that man-made factors are dominant.
    Although secondary soil salinization is closely related to irrigation, the salt and alkali in the soil move with the movement of soil moisture. Irrigation can not only improve saline-alkali land (washing salt, pressing salt, and diluting soil salt content), but also, by adopting correct irrigation techniques and mastering the movement of soil water, can effectively prevent soil salinization. Thinking that salinization is an inevitable result of irrigation, worrying about soil salinization and daring not to develop irrigation, or even stopping irrigation and "returning water to drought," are all "throwing the baby out with the bathwater" ideas and are incorrect.
    Since soil salinization "comes with water," our approach is to make it "go away with water." The principle of "prevention first, combining prevention and treatment, taking water as the key, and comprehensive management" proposed at the National Saline-Alkali Soil Prevention and Control Conference in November 1959 is completely correct. It gives us a powerful weapon to overcome soil salinization.
    To prevent secondary soil salinization, we should mainly focus on three key aspects: irrigation, drainage, and cultivation. Specifically, we must achieve systemization of engineering, rationalization of irrigation, planning of water use, and gardenization of irrigation areas.
    Systemization of Engineering
    In terms of irrigation systems, what is currently more urgent is to improve the canal system and carry out anti-seepage work on the canals. A complete canal system and necessary control structures should be established in the irrigation area. When constructing irrigation areas, in addition to building water diversion structures and large water conveyance canals, field canals should also be built. Generally speaking, the field canal system should have at least three levels: distribution canals for land sections (branch canals or farm canals), which draw water from large canals and distribute it to various plots; distribution canals for plots (capillary canals, which are temporary canals in mechanized farming areas), which transport water to the furrows in the farmland; and water conveyance furrows, which pour water into the ditches and ridges, finally completing the irrigation process.
    The standard for controlling surface water is to ensure that the stagnation time of standing water on farmland does not harm crop growth and high yield, and that the groundwater level, which is temporarily raised by the infiltration of standing water, does not affect the development of crop roots. After the rainy season, the groundwater should be able to quickly drop below the safe depth (the safe depth is the groundwater depth that does not cause soil salinization; in northern irrigation areas, it is generally 1.2-1.5 meters for clay soils and 1.5-2.0 meters for light soils). In autumn crop fields, standing water should be drained within one or two days after rain.
    The measure to control and lower the groundwater level is to dig drainage ditches. The depth of the drainage ditch should be such that the groundwater level in the section it controls is below the safe depth. According to experiments in northern irrigation areas, the depth of the last-level drainage ditch can generally be set at 1.5-2.5 meters, depending on the soil quality and groundwater quality. The greater the safe depth, the deeper the drainage ditch should be dug.
    Groundwater resources are abundant in northern irrigation areas of our country. We should use both well irrigation and canal irrigation in tandem. This is not only an important means of improving drought resistance, but also these water wells can actually play the role of "vertical drainage," effectively preventing the rise of groundwater. This is an ideal form of combining irrigation and drainage.
    Rationalization of Irrigation
    Adopting reasonable irrigation quotas and resolutely eliminating large-quota irrigation can prevent the rise of groundwater after irrigation and also save water to expand the irrigated area. At present, in quite a few areas, the actual irrigation quota is too large, generally above 50 cubic meters per mu, and large-scale flooding irrigation is even as high as 80 to 100 cubic meters, greatly exceeding the water retention capacity of the crop root activity layer (generally 60 to 80 centimeters for crops such as cotton and wheat). This amount of water is not only wasted in vain, causing the groundwater to rise, but also damages the soil structure, leaches away valuable nutrients in the soil, and lowers the soil temperature, which is detrimental to the current year's crop yield. For example, according to the results of our experiments on different irrigation methods for cotton in the People's Victory Canal irrigation area, the soil with a suitable irrigation quota contains one to five times more available nitrogen and phosphorus than that of large-scale flooding irrigation, the ground temperature is 2-4°C higher, and the soil porosity is about 10% higher, thus reducing the boll shedding rate by 10% to 15% and increasing the yield of seed cotton by 20 to 30 jin per mu.
    The practice of high-yield farmers and years of experimental research have proven that an irrigation quota of 30 to 40 cubic meters per mu is sufficient for dryland crops such as cotton and wheat. This quota can also ensure that the groundwater is not raised after irrigation.
    Planning of Water Use
    Planned water use is to make a scientific analysis and planned arrangement of all aspects of the irrigation process in advance, so that the irrigation work can be carried out in an orderly manner. Planned water use is a reflection and requirement of planned production in the irrigation work under the socialist system. Since 1954 (the second year after irrigation), the Qiliying People's Commune in the People's Victory Canal Irrigation Area of Henan has adhered to the planned water use of a small Jizhi canal (controlling an irrigation area of about 50,000 mu). It has not only ensured that crop yields have increased year after year, but also that water consumption has decreased year by year. In the six years of irrigation, the rising trend of groundwater has been basically curbed, and soil salinization has rarely occurred or expanded.
    Gardenization of Irrigation Areas
    Uneven land in the irrigation area will cause water accumulation in low-lying areas and salt return in high-lying areas after irrigation or rainfall. This is an important reason for the formation of salt spots in the irrigation area. We must vigorously carry out land leveling work, and at the same time do a good job in field engineering to achieve "flat land, straight ridges, rows of ridges and fields, canals that do not leak, and ridges that do not flood."
    Frequent plowing, harrowing, and weeding can cut off the capillary action of the soil, which can both conserve moisture and prevent salt return. Increasing the application of organic fertilizers, implementing crop rotation, and increasing green manure can improve the physical properties of the soil. Rational close planting, and appropriate intercropping of cultivated crops, reduce ground evaporation. All of these have a significant effect on preventing salinization.
    At the same time, within the irrigation area, we should pay great attention to the rational layout of crop planting. In dryland crop irrigation areas, avoid decentralized planting of rice. At the same time, vigorously carry out the greening work in the irrigation area, and build shelterbelts along canals, reservoirs, roads, and around irrigated areas. Dense forests not only reduce wind speed, improve the climate, increase air humidity, and reduce surface evaporation, but also their strong root systems absorb a large amount of groundwater, which can play the role of "biological drainage."
    In order to ensure agricultural high yield, in areas threatened by salinization, it is necessary to actively carry out mass observation and research work, and carry out fixed-point observation of groundwater and soil salt content universally and persistently. On this basis, grasp the occurrence and evolution law of soil salinization, further carry out the prediction of the occurrence and development of salinization, so that prevention and control work has greater initiative, and realize the task of "overcoming salinization in a short period of time."

    防止灌区土壤盐碱化
    水利水电科学研究院灌溉研究所
    随着水利建设的日益发展，全国各地在预防土壤盐碱化和改良盐碱地方面都取得了巨大的成就。但是，有一些地区，由于灌溉和耕作措施不够合理，因而造成地下水位不同程度的上升，结果发生部分土壤盐碱化的现象。有些人看不见我国新增几亿亩灌溉面积对农业生产所起的巨大增产作用，看不见我们已经改良和利用了几千万亩老盐碱地，而把目前暂时和局部发生的土壤盐碱化问题加以夸大和歪曲。说什么“土壤盐碱化是兴修水利的结果”，是“水利变成了水害”，甚至还企图否定“以蓄为主”的方针。这显然是十分荒谬的。
    在干旱、半干旱地区和滨海地区，地下水和土壤中都含有一定量的可溶性盐类。当地下水升高到离地面一定深度时，由于土壤中毛细管作用和地面强烈蒸发的结果，地下水和土壤底土中的盐分便迅速向地表积聚，使耕作层土壤含盐量超过农作物所能忍受的程度。这就是通常所说的“灌区土壤次生盐碱化”。
    灌区土壤盐碱化有其内在和外在的原因。外在的原因也可说是人为的因素。实践证明，人为的因素是主导的。
    土壤次生盐碱化虽然同灌溉有密切的关系，但是，土壤中的盐碱是随着土壤水分的运动而运动的，灌溉不但可以改良盐碱地（洗盐、压盐和冲淡土壤盐分），而且采取正确的灌溉技术和掌握土壤水的运动，完全可以有效地防止土壤的盐碱化。认为盐碱化是灌溉的必然结果，顾虑土壤盐碱化而不敢发展灌溉，甚至停止灌溉，“退水为旱”，都是“因噎废食”的想法，是不正确的。
    土壤盐碱既是“随水而来”，我们的办法就是使它“随水而去”。1959年11月举行的全国盐碱土防治会议上所提出的“以防为主，防治并重，以水为纲，综合治理”的方针是完全正确的。它给我们战胜土壤盐碱化以有力的武器。
    防止土壤次生盐碱化，主要应当抓住灌溉、排水和耕作栽培等三个环节。具体说来，就是要做到工程系统化、灌水合理化、用水计划化、灌区园田化。
    工程系统化
    在灌溉系统上，目前比较迫切的是健全渠系和进行渠道的防渗工作。要在灌区建立一个完备的渠道系统和必要的控制建筑物。在兴修灌区时，除了建筑引水的建筑物和大型的输水渠道以外，田间也应该修建渠系。一般说来，田间渠系至少要有三级——地段配水渠（斗渠或农渠），它从大型渠道上引水，并将水分配到各个地块；地块分水渠（毛渠，在机耕地区是临时渠），它将水输送到农田中的龙沟；输水龙沟，它将水灌入沟、畦中，最后完成灌溉的过程。
    控制地面水的标准是使积水在农田上停滞的时间不至于危害作物生育和丰产，并且使积水下渗而暂时抬高的地下水位不致影响作物根系发育。雨季过后地下水能够迅速下降到安全深度以下（安全深度是不致土壤盐碱化的地下水深度，在北方灌区，粘质土一般为1．2—1．5米，轻质土一般为1．5—2．0米）。在秋作物农田中，应当在雨后一、二天排尽积水。
    控制和降低地下水的措施是开挖排水沟。排水沟的深度应当使它所控制的地段的地下水位在安全深度以下。根据在北方灌区的试验，最末级排水沟的深度根据土质与地下水质情况，一般可定为1．5—2．5米。安全深度愈大的，排水沟应当挖得愈深。
    我国北方灌区地下水源丰富。应该使井灌、渠灌“双管齐下”，这样不仅是提高抗旱能力的重要手段，而且这些水井实际上能起“垂直排水”的作用，有效地防止了地下水的升高。这是灌溉与排水相结合的理想形式。
    灌水合理化
    采用合理的灌水定额，坚决杜绝大定额灌水，可以防止灌后地下水上升，还可以节约用水以扩大灌溉面积。目前，有相当多的地区，实际灌水定额偏大，每亩地一般均在五十立方米以上，大水漫灌的更高达八十到一百立方米，大大超过作物根系活动层，（对于棉、麦等作物，一般为六十到八十厘米）的保水能力。这些水量不仅仅白白浪费，造成地下水的上升，而且破坏土壤结构，淋洗土壤中宝贵的养分，降低地温，对于当年的作物丰产不利。例如，根据我们在人民胜利渠灌区对于棉花进行不同灌水方法试验的结果证明：适宜的灌水定额比大水漫灌的土壤含速效氮、磷多一到五倍，地温高2—4℃，土壤空隙率多10％左右，因而使蕾铃脱落率减少10％到15％，每亩增产二十到三十斤皮棉。
    丰产能手的实践和多年的试验研究证明，对于棉、麦这些旱作物，每亩有三十到四十立方米的灌水定额就已经足够。这种定额也能保证在灌溉后地下水不被抬高。
    用水计划化
    计划用水就是事先对于灌溉过程的各个环节作出科学的分析和有计划的安排，使灌溉工作有条不紊地进行。计划用水是社会主义制度下，有计划生产在灌溉工作上的反映和要求。河南人民胜利渠灌区的七里营人民公社有一条小冀支渠（控制灌溉面积约五万亩），从1954年（灌后第二年）坚持执行计划用水以来，不仅保证了农作物产量连年上升，而且用水量逐年下降。灌溉六年来，地下水上升的趋势已基本制止，土壤盐碱化也极少发生与扩展。
    灌区园田化
    灌区土地不平，会使得灌溉或降雨后，洼处积水，高处返盐。这是灌区形成盐斑的一个重要原因。要大力开展土地平整工作，同时做好田间工程，达到“地平埂直，畦田成排，渠不跑水，畦不漫灌”。
    经常的耕、耙、锄，可以切断土壤的毛细管作用，既能保墒又能防止返盐。增施有机肥料，实行轮作，增加绿肥，可以使土壤物理性质得到改善。合理密植，中耕作物适当进行间作，减少地面蒸发。所有这些，对防止盐碱化都有显著作用。
    同时，在灌区内应当十分重视作物种植的合理布局。在旱作物灌区，要避免分散种植水稻。同时，大力进行灌区的绿化工作，沿渠道、水库、道路与灌水地段周围营造防护林带。茂密的树林，不仅减低风速，改善气候，提高空气湿度，减少地表蒸发，而且它们强大的根系吸收了大量的地下水，可以起“生物排水”的作用。
    为了保证农业丰产，在有盐碱化威胁的地区，必须积极开展群众性的观测研究工作，把地下水和土壤盐分的定位观测普遍而持久地进行下去。在这个基础上，掌握土壤盐碱化的发生演变规律，进一步进行盐碱化发生发展的预报，使防治工作具有更大的主动性，实现“在较短时期内战胜盐碱化”的任务。
