    Wu Min, the pig breeding expert of the Yuanxia Production Team of the Liugezhuang People's Commune in Haiyang County, Shandong Province, is praised by everyone for his dedication and skill. In 1959, the sows he bred using new methods all produced high yields, averaging 22.5 piglets per sow per year. The piglet breeding rate increased by 88% compared to 1957. From January to November 1959, none of the more than 2,000 piglets delivered by him died, and all grew up strong and healthy.
    In 1954, during the period of primary agricultural cooperatives, he responded to the Party's call and became the first breeding expert. From then on, he devoted himself to studying breeding techniques, quickly transforming from a novice to an expert. In 1956, high-quality Duoshan breed pigs were brought here. These pigs grew quickly and had tender, fatty meat, but some sows did not come into heat even after reaching more than 100 kilograms. Wu Min painstakingly studied its secrets and finally found a way to induce estrus through forced mating. Sows that did not come into heat would do so in seven to eight days after being forcibly mated. Later, he learned from other places the method of using glutinous rice flowers to stimulate estrus, which ensured that the sows produced five litters in two years. However, the breeding rate of Duoshan breed pigs was very low. In 1957, the average number of piglets produced per adult sow was only 12.5. Wu Min again sought advice from teachers everywhere and adopted advanced breeding methods such as double insemination, re-insemination, and continuous insemination, which continuously improved the piglet breeding rate. In 1958, the average annual piglet production of Duoshan breed pigs reached 17.5 per head, and in 1959 it increased to 22.5 per head.
    Wu Min also serves as a pig midwife, and he loves this work just as much. After the communalization, the pig farm expanded, and he checked the more than 1,100 pigs in the pig farm at least three times every night. If he saw that the sows were not protecting the piglets well, he would help move them to a better position. When it was cold, he added straw to the pigsty; when it was hot, he filled the pig bathing pool with water for the pigs to bathe. During the sows' labor period, he stayed by their side, whether it was a bitterly cold night or a hot noon, he always stayed by the side of the sows about to give birth until the piglets were delivered. He and the young breeder, Li Shicun, boldly tried artificial assistance methods, which solved the problem of dystocia in sows. In May, a sow had been unable to give birth to piglets for nearly a day. After artificial assistance, not only was the sow saved, but also all five piglets survived and were healthy.
    Wu Min observes and studies the behavior of pigs every day. From the way the pigs walk and the sound of their breathing, he can tell their temperaments and whether they are sick. He knows the temperaments of all twenty-four boars and two hundred and five adult sows in the entire farm very well. Therefore, he always performs injections or temperature checks on the boars and sows under his care very smoothly. Now, Wu Min is working with the young breeder Li Shicun to study how to increase the annual output of each sow to more than 25 piglets. (Attached picture)

    人人夸奖的配种员——吴敏
    山东海阳县留格庄人民公社院下生产队的生猪配种员吴敏，人人夸他心红手巧。他1959年用新法配种的母猪头头高产，平均每头母猪年产二十二点五头，仔猪繁殖率比1957年提高了88％。1959年1至11月份，经他接生的两千多头仔猪，没有一头死亡，头头长得健壮。
    1954年初级农业社时，他响应党的号召，第一个当了配种员。从那时起，他就一心钻研配种技术，很快由外行变为内行。1956年，这里买来了垛山优种猪，这种猪生长快，肉肥嫩，可是有的母猪长到一百多斤还不发情。吴敏苦心钻研它的秘密，终于找到了强配促使母猪发情的办法，不发情的母猪经过强配后，七至八天就发情了。以后他又学习了外地用糯稻花催情的办法，因而保证了母猪两年产五窝。可是垛山优种猪繁殖率很低，1957年平均每头成年母猪只产仔猪十二点五头。吴敏又到处拜师请教，采取了双种配、重配、连续配等先进的配种方法，使仔猪繁殖率不断提高。1958年垛山优种猪平均每头年产仔猪达十七点五头，1959年又提高到二十二点五头。
    吴敏还担任着猪的接生员，他同样热爱这一工作。公社化后猪场扩大了，养猪场的一千一百多头猪，他每晚至少要查看三趟。见到母猪对小猪保护的不好，他就帮助搬换位置。天冷了，给猪舍添草；天热时，将猪浴塘里放满了水，让猪洗澡。母猪临产期，他便守在旁边，不论是酷冷的夜里，还是炎热的中午，他总是守在临产母猪旁，直到接下了小猪才走。他和青年饲养员李世存，大胆试行了人工助产的办法，解决了母猪难产的问题。5月间，有一头母猪近一天没生下小猪，经用人工助产后，不但母猪脱险，而且五只小猪也都成活健壮。
    吴敏天天观察研究猪的行动，他从猪的行走和呼吸声中，可以知道它们的脾气和是否有病，他对全场二十四头种猪和二百零五头成年母猪的脾气都摸得清清楚楚。所以，他在给自己管理的种猪和母猪注射或检查体温时，总是进行得很顺利。现在，吴敏正与青年饲养员李世存研究，要使每头母猪的年产量提高到二十五头以上。（附图片）
