    Arming to Defend the Fruits of Revolutionary Victory
    Cuba's Militia Organization Work Creates a Surge of Enthusiasm
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, January 9th: The work of organizing militias and conducting military training in Cuba has reached a climax in various factories, sugar mills, urban areas, and schools.

    According to incomplete statistics, more than two thousand university students have joined the militia. An armed militia battalion of four hundred Havana students, personally led by Prime Minister Castro, is receiving military training in the old base of the rebel army, the Sierra Maestra mountains. On January 9th, they paraded through the streets of Santiago de Cuba along with student militias from Oriente Province.

    Yesterday, the Architects' Militia was newly formed. They will not only receive military training but also learn military architecture.

    Workers and peasants are the vanguard in the militia movement. Agricultural workers are conducting shooting practice in the sugarcane fields. In the Luyano district of the capital, a militia composed of six hundred transportation workers, tobacco workers, winemakers, hospital and commercial staff has learned to handle weapons and several other military skills. Women are also actively participating in militia and military training work. In Luyano, more than one hundred women have formed a militia team named the Luyano Martyrs Team, and they are receiving preliminary guidance training.

    In order to accelerate the work of organizing the militia, the Ministry of Revolutionary Armed Forces established the National Leading Committee of the Revolutionary Militia on January 8th, appointing Rogelio Acevedo González as the chairman. Orders have been issued to the heads of all armed forces to provide military training to all Cuban people who voluntarily request it. (Attached picture)

    武装起来保卫革命胜利果实
    古巴组织民兵工作形成热潮
    新华社哈瓦那9日电　古巴组织民兵和进行军事训练的工作已经在各工厂、糖厂、市区和学校形成高潮。
    据不完全的统计，有二千多名大学生参加了民兵。由卡斯特罗总理亲自率领的四百名哈瓦那学生的武装民兵大队在起义军的老根据地马埃斯特腊山接受军训。9日他们与奥连特省的学生民兵一起在圣地亚哥的街道上举行了游行。
    昨天新组成了建筑师民兵。他们不仅将接受军事训练，而且将要学会军事建筑术。
    工人和农民是民兵运动中的先锋队。农业工人在甘蔗地里进行射击实习。在首都卢亚诺区由六百名运输工人、烟草工人、造酒工人、医院和商业职员组成的民兵，已经学会了掌握武器和其他几种军事技术。妇女们也积极地参加了民兵及军事训练工作。在卢亚诺，一百多妇女组成了一个命名为卢亚诺烈士队的民兵队，她们正在接受初步的辅导训练。
    为了加速组织民兵的工作，革命武装部8日建立了革命民兵全国领导委员会，任命罗赫略·阿塞维多·冈萨雷斯为委员长。已有命令下达各武装部队首脑，要他们对所有自愿要求军训的古巴人民提供军事训练的方便条件。（附图片）
