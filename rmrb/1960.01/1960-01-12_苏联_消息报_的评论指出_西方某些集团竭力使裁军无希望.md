Xinhua News Agency, 11th -- TASS reported: Soviet "Izvestia" commentator Khokhlov emphasized in a commentary on the 10th that the issue of disarmament has long gone beyond the scope of general diplomatic issues and has now become a matter of great concern to billions of people in various countries around the world. Under these circumstances, it is no accident that even the openly reactionary groups in the West are increasingly afraid to openly oppose the Soviet government's policy of complete and thorough disarmament.

At the same time, Khokhlov pointed out that certain groups in the West are trying their best to make 1960 hopeless in terms of disarmament. It is no accident that articles like this are appearing in American newspapers, attempting to prove that normal survival is impossible under disarmament. Khokhlov said, however, that times have changed. In those same American newspapers, rather sober views are also increasingly being published about the West needing to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on the issue of complete disarmament. The American newspapers’ reaction to President Eisenhower’s recent “State of the Union Address” to the United States Congress can serve as an example of this.

Khokhlov said that American newspapers pointed out that the American president’s address did not put forward any concrete plans on the disarmament issue, nor did it put forward other constructive measures that, in the eyes of people in the American government, could lead to the "just peace" mentioned in the address. Khokhlov believes that these reactions prove that American public opinion hopes to hear concrete programs on disarmament and strengthening peace from the leaders of the American government. Anyone who evades these issues will lose their political prestige. This is the demand of the times.

    苏联“消息报”的评论指出
    西方某些集团竭力使裁军无希望
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联“消息报”评论员霍赫洛夫10日在评论中强调指出，裁军问题早已越出了一般外交问题的范围，现在已经成为世界各国亿万人民极其关心的问题。在这种情况下，就连西方的露骨的反动集团越来越不敢公开出来反对苏联政府的全面和彻底裁军的方针，这并不是偶然的。
    霍赫洛夫同时指出，西方的某些集团竭力使1960年在裁军方面毫无希望。美国报纸上出现这样的文章并不是偶然的，这些文章企图证明在裁军情况下不可能正常生存。霍赫洛夫说，但是，时代已经变了。在同样的那些美国报纸上，也越来越经常地发表关于西方必须同苏联就全面裁军问题达成协议的相当清醒的见解。美国报纸对艾森豪威尔总统最近在美国国会宣读的“国情咨文”的反应，可以作为这方面的例子。
    霍赫洛夫说，美国报纸指出，美国总统的咨文在裁军方面没有提出任何具体的计划，也没有提出别的、在美国政府人士看来能够导致咨文中所说的“公正和平”的建设性措施。霍赫洛夫认为，这些反应证明，美国的舆论希望从美国政府领导人那里听到有关裁军、加强和平问题的具体纲领。谁要回避这些问题，谁就会失去自己的政治威望。这是时代的要求。
