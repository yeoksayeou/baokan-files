Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th: To celebrate the tenth anniversary of signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance (February 14th), a Sino-Soviet friendship evening was held at the "Friendship House" here on the 14th. The evening was jointly organized by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the "Friendship House."

The host of the evening, Danilov, Director of the Department of Oriental Socialist Countries of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, said that the Soviet and Chinese people will warmly celebrate their great festival - the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. He said that Sino-Soviet friendship has a long history, and Lenin at that time placed great concern in the Chinese people. In the most difficult years of the revolution, the people of the two countries have always helped each other unswervingly. The victory of the Chinese people and the founding of the People's Republic of China opened a new page for Sino-Soviet friendship. The people of our two countries are advancing hand in hand towards the great common goal of communism.

Soviet People's Actress Lepekhinskaya, who recently returned from China, spoke with emotion to the audience about her impressions of Chinese women and children during her visit to China. When she talked about a people's commune she visited in the suburbs of Guangzhou, she said that she was deeply moved by the conversation of a 78-year-old woman in the commune who loved life and labor, and she immediately recited a poem she had specially written for the old woman to the audience. She added that the Chinese people have a high degree of labor consciousness, and every child receives a good education in love of labor from an early age.

Also speaking at the evening were members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League delegations who had recently visited China. They talked about their feelings and impressions as guests in China.

Zhang Yingwu, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, embassy staff, and representatives of Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union were all invited to attend the evening.

A cultural program was performed and a movie was shown at the evening.

Chinese books were also displayed in the corridors of the "Friendship House."

    莫斯科举行苏中友好晚会
    新华社莫斯科15日电　为迎接中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年（2月14日），14日晚上在这里的“友谊之家”举行了苏中友好晚会。晚会是由苏中友好协会和“友谊之家”共同举办的。
    晚会主持人、苏联对外友好和文化协会联合会东方社会主义国家部主任达尼洛夫说，苏中人民将热烈庆祝他们的伟大节日——苏中友好同盟互助条约签订十周年。他说，苏中友谊已有悠久的历史，列宁当时就对中国人民寄予极大的关怀。在最艰苦的革命的岁月里，两国人民始终不渝地互相帮助，中国人民的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立为苏中友谊揭开了新的一页。我们两国人民正朝着伟大的共产主义这一共同目标携手前进。
    不久前才从中国回来的苏联人民演员列别辛斯卡娅充满感情地向到会者畅谈了她访问中国时对中国妇女儿童的印象。她在谈到她所参观的广州近郊的一个人民公社时说，她深深为这个公社的一位七十八岁的老太太热爱生活和劳动的谈话所感动，并当场为到会者朗诵了她特地为这位老太太作的一首诗。她又说，中国人民有着高度的劳动自觉，每个孩子从小就受到良好的爱劳动的教育。
    在晚会上讲话的还有不久前访问过中国的苏中友协、苏联列宁共产主义青年团等代表团的人员。他们谈到了在中国作客的感想和印象。
    中国驻苏联大使馆参赞张映吾和使馆工作人员以及中国留苏学生代表，都应邀出席了晚会。
    在晚会上演出了文娱节目并放映了电影。
