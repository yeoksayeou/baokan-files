Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi: At the beginning of the new year, various parts of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region promptly shifted about 50% of their labor force to the front line of spring plowing production, launching a spring plowing production competition centered on accumulating fertilizer. The amount of fertilizer accumulated is increasing daily. In Kashgar Prefecture, the daily amount of fertilizer accumulated in the first ten days of January increased by more than 40% compared to December of last year. The high-quality fertilizer already accumulated in the entire prefecture is enough to provide an average of over sixty loads per mu of land. Moyu County in Hotan Prefecture, where the climate is warmer, has accumulated an average of 150 loads of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land. Various regions are simultaneously accumulating and delivering fertilizer. In Shanshan County in the Turpan Basin, sixty-four specialized fertilizer accumulation teams and two hundred and thirty-three groups have been organized this year to concentrate on accumulating and transporting fertilizer. Now, carts and donkey carts transporting fertilizer are constantly coming and going in the fields. In addition to delivering topdressing fertilizer to more than 26,000 mu of winter wheat fields, the county has also delivered base fertilizer to more than 50,000 mu of cotton fields for spring planting.

In order to prepare for spring irrigation, Hotan Prefecture, which has already completed the year's water conservancy construction earthwork task, is focusing on the supporting, water storage, irrigation and irrigation management of water conservancy projects, striving to bring all water conservancy projects into play for irrigation as soon as possible. Pishan County, which has already realized river channelization, is currently concentrating more than 8,000 carpenters, bricklayers and water conservancy workers to rush to repair the sluice gates, drops and bridges of five major trunk canals, to ensure that all canals can divert water for irrigation before spring sowing.

This year, various regions generally started repairing and manufacturing spring plowing farm tools more than a month earlier. Hotan County, where the spring sowing period is earlier, has now completed the repair of all farm tools. By the 13th, Yumin County in Tacheng Prefecture had repaired eighty-seven plows, fifty-eight harrows and five seeders, and newly manufactured three hundred and forty-two sets of various farm tools.

    新疆半数劳力投入备耕活动
    据新华社乌鲁木齐讯　新年一开始，新疆维吾尔自治区各地就以50％左右的劳力及时转到备耕生产战线，开展了以积肥为中心的备耕生产竞赛。积肥数量日日上升。喀什专区1月上旬的日积肥量，比去年12月份增加了40％以上。现在全专区已积的优质肥料，平均每亩地可达六十担以上。气候较暖的和田专区墨玉县，已为每亩熟地平均积肥一百五十担。各地边积肥边送肥。吐鲁番盆地的鄯善县，今年组织了六十四个积肥专业队和二百三十三个小组，突击积肥、运肥。现在田野上运肥的马车、驴车来往不绝，全县除了已给二万六千多亩冬麦地运送追肥以外，还给五万多亩春耕播种的棉田运送了基肥。
    为了准备春耕用水，已经完成了全年水利建设土石方任务的和田专区，正在大抓水利工程的配套、蓄水、灌水和灌溉管理等工作，争取所有水利工程及早发挥灌溉效益。已实现了河流渠道化的皮山县，目前正集中八千多名铁木砖瓦工和水利民工，突击抢修五条大干渠的闸门、跌水、桥梁等，保证在春播前全部水渠都能引水灌溉。
    各地今年普遍提前一个多月动手检修和制造春耕农具。春播期较早的和田县，目前已经把全部农具检修完毕。塔城专区的裕民县到13日已修好了八十七部犁、五十八个耙和五架播种机，新制了各种农具三百四十二套。
