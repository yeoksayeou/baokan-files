Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 21st: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on January 20 regarding the signing of the "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" by the governments of Japan and the United States. The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea firmly opposes the conclusion of a new aggressive military alliance treaty between the Japanese government and the United States government. The Korean people cannot tolerate the heinous act of the American imperialists, the mortal enemy of the Korean nation, forming an "alliance" with the Japanese militarists, who are reviving and seriously threatening peace and security in the Far East and Asia.
    The statement pointed out that the "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" concluded by the governments of Japan and the United States in Washington on January 19 is an alliance treaty between the American imperialists and the Japanese reactionary clique, who are colluding with each other for the purpose of reviving Japanese militarism, arming Japan with nuclear weapons, and organizing new military blocs to jointly invade the people of Asia.
    The statement pointed out that, at the same time, the American imperialists have recently transported a large number of nuclear weapons and rocket weapons into South Korea, turning South Korea into an atomic strategic base. The statement said that all these actions by the United States have aggravated the danger of a new war in the Far East and Asia, thereby arousing great anger and unease among the people of Asian countries.
    The statement said that the Korean people fully support the struggle of the Japanese people against the provocative conspiracies of the US-Japan reactionary ruling clique and for peace, democracy, independence, and neutrality.
    The statement emphasized that in order to maintain peace and security in the Far East, the United States military must withdraw from all areas of Asia, including South Korea and Japan, and remove US military bases; a nuclear-weapon-free zone of peace must be established in Asia; and Japan must become an independent, peace-loving, and neutral country.
    The statement said that if the American imperialists and the Japanese reactionary clique who follow them do not abandon their evil conspiracy against all the people of Asia, including the Korean people, they will surely suffer a disastrous defeat.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 19th: The Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea recently sent a telegram to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), supporting the just struggle of the Japanese working class against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and demanding the abolition of the treaty.
    Other trade union organizations in Korea have also sent telegrams to their Japanese counterpart trade unions, supporting their struggle.

    声明指出，日美两国政府1月19日在华盛顿缔结的“共同合作和安全条约”，是互相勾结的美帝国主义者和日本反动集团缔结的一项目的在于复活日本军国主义，使日本进行核武装，组织新的军事集团来共同侵略亚洲人民的同盟条约。
    声明指出，与此同时，美帝国主义者最近又把大量核武器和火箭武器运入南朝鲜，把南朝鲜变为原子战略基地。声明说，美国的这一切行动加重了远东和亚洲地区的新战争的危险，从而引起亚洲各国人民的巨大愤怒和不安。
    声明说，朝鲜人民完全支持日本人民反对美日反动统治集团的挑衅性阴谋活动，为争取和平、民主、独立、中立而进行的斗争。
    声明强调说，为了维护远东的和平和安全，必须使美国军队撤出包括南朝鲜和日本在内的亚洲一切地区，并且撤除美军的基地；必须在亚洲建立无原子武器的和平地区；必须使日本成为独立的爱好和平的中立国家。
    声明说，美帝国主义者和追随它的日本反动集团如果不放弃反对包括朝鲜人民在内的全体亚洲人民的罪恶阴谋，它必将遭到惨重的失败。
