A Review of the International Situation Over the Past Year
Ji Ping
Editor's Note: In order to help readers analyze some major international events more timely, we plan to publish irregular "Commentaries on Current Affairs" from this year onwards, to replace the past "Semi-Monthly International Reviews."

1959 was a great year in which the East wind further prevailed over the West wind. The development of the international situation became increasingly favorable to the forces of peace and unfavorable to the forces of war, favorable to socialism and unfavorable to imperialism. The wheel of history is continuing to move forward in this definite direction. Looking back and looking forward, all peace-loving and progressive people around the world feel infinitely excited and full of confidence in their future.

The Socialist Camp's Strength is Unprecedentedly Powerful

In 1959, the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union was filled with auspicious light and a beautiful spring scene everywhere. Over the past year, socialist countries have achieved a common surge in their national economies, and their mutual solidarity and cooperation have also seen new developments. This has made the strength of the entire socialist camp unprecedentedly enhanced.

The past year was a year for socialist countries to accelerate the construction of communism and socialism. The law of high-speed economic development in socialist countries has led to leaps and bounds in the economy. The Soviet Union's grand program for implementing communism—the first year of the seven-year plan for developing the national economy—got off to a flying start. The industrial production in the first eleven months of 1959 increased by 11.3% compared with the same period in 1958, greatly exceeding the average annual growth target set by the seven-year plan. China continued its overall Great Leap Forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and the people's communes were further consolidated and developed, ensuring the completion of the main targets of the second five-year plan three years ahead of schedule. The economies of other socialist countries are also advancing at a high speed. Compared with the same period in 1958, the industrial production in the first half of 1959 increased in each country as follows: Albania 26.1%, Hungary 9%, Bulgaria 23.4%, German Democratic Republic 12.4%, Poland 9.3%, Romania 20.5%, Czechoslovakia 11%, Democratic Republic of Vietnam 62.3%, Democratic People's Republic of Korea 75%, and Mongolia 8.3%. This comprehensive and high-speed development of the economies of socialist countries fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system.

What the socialist camp is particularly proud of is the new great achievements made by the Soviet Union in science and technology. Following the successful launch of three huge artificial satellites in 1957-1958, the Soviet Union launched three more cosmic rockets in 1959, the first becoming an artificial planet in the solar system, the second hitting the moon, and the third sending out an automatic interplanetary station, successfully taking pictures of the far side of the moon that humans had never seen before. This marks the Soviet Union's ascent to the highest peak in the world in science and technology.

In the process of the forward development of politics, economy, science and technology in socialist countries, the mental outlook of the people of all countries has undergone significant changes. The parties and governments of all countries have strengthened the Marxist-Leninist education of the people, greatly raising their communist consciousness. In the mass movements of the "Communist Labor Brigades" in the Soviet Union and the "Socialist Labor Brigades" in the fraternal countries, thousands upon thousands of heroic figures have emerged who dedicate themselves to the cause of communist and socialist construction without regard to remuneration. The socialist system has brought about a great ideological liberation for the working people, enabling them to fully exert their initiative and create all kinds of miracles.

Contradictions Among Imperialist Countries are Increasingly Acute

In contrast to the thriving and vigorous development of socialist camp countries, the imperialist camp has continued to decline in the past year.

Although after the shocks of the 1958 economic crisis, the economies of the United States and Western European countries have experienced some "recovery" in 1959, due to "excess" production capacity, relatively shrinking markets, serious inflation, deteriorating financial conditions, and the inability to solve unemployment problems, the economies of many capitalist countries face numerous difficulties, bleak prospects, lurking crises, and a very difficult time.

Another most prominent scene in the capitalist world over the past year is that the unbalanced development of various countries is more obvious, and the economic status of the United States has greatly declined. At the same time, Europe has seen two major economic groups, the six-nation "Common Market" headed by West Germany and France and the seven-nation "Little Free Trade Area" headed by Britain, plus the economic forces of the United States, forming a fierce trade confrontation. In this situation, the struggle for commodity markets, investment locations, and financial hegemony in the capitalist world is becoming more acute.

After the war, the industrial production of the United States once dominated with an advantage of 56.4% of the industrial production of the capitalist world. However, the five Western European countries (West Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium) only accounted for 13.7%. However, over the past decade or so, various capitalist countries have gradually recovered from the blows of the war, and have massively updated and expanded fixed capital. From 1958 to 1959, fixed capital investment in major Western European countries increased by 90.9%, while the United States only increased by 34.6% during the same period. The industrial growth rate in Western Europe has greatly exceeded that of the United States. For example, taking the level of industrial production in 1948 as 100, by 1958, West Germany had risen to 382%, France 266%, Britain 138%, and Japan in Asia had increased to 434%. The United States only rose to 29%. By 1958, the share of industrial production in the United States in the capitalist world had fallen from 56.4% in 1948 to 46.6%, Britain from 11.7% to 8.2%, while West Germany had risen from 3% to 10.7%. The share of the United States in the total exports of the capitalist world has also fallen from 34.6% in 1947 to 23.2% in 1958. West Germany has surpassed Britain's 18% to reach 18.6%. Due to a sharp decline in exports and the need to allocate huge amounts of military aid and overseas military expenditures, the United States has experienced a deficit in its international balance of payments, which, according to official US figures, is estimated to reach $4.5 billion in 1959. As a result, a large amount of gold has flowed out. From January 1958 to the end of August 1959, the gold outflow from the United States reached a huge amount of $3.37 billion, reducing the US gold reserves from 70% of the capitalist world in 1949 to about 50%. This cannot but greatly shake the leading position of the "gold dollar empire."

In the capitalist world, the fastest economic growth is in West Germany and Japan. West Germany's industrial production in 1959 has exceeded the highest pre-war level in 1936 by one and a half times. In 1958, West Germany's industrial production accounted for 10.7% of the capitalist world, surpassing Britain's 8.2%, and second only to the United States. Japan's industrial production, by August 1959, had reached 2.7 times the pre-war level. This has greatly enhanced the economic competitiveness of West Germany and Japan, and due to the support of US imperialism, re-arming West Germany and Japan, the militarism of these two countries has rapidly revived and begun to embark on the road of external economic expansion.

Economic contradictions cannot but be reflected in politics. The political infighting of imperialism over the past year has also become acute. Although the United States has tried its best to make up for this rift, around the recent North Atlantic Group Council, the United States hoped to adjust the contradictions between the "Common Market" and the "Little Free Trade Area" under its control, France demanded to share leadership with the United States and Britain, and the United States forced France to accept the "integration" of the North Atlantic Group's armaments, but none of these were resolved. This further exposed that this kind of contradiction between imperialism, rooted in conflicts of interest, is irreconcilable.

Monopoly capital groups always transfer the losses caused by increased competition and financial crises to the working people. They try every means to increase taxes, freeze wages, raise prices, and lay off workers. In this situation, the broad masses of working people, driven by the need for livelihood, resolutely rise up to counter the attack on their rights to life. Over the past year, the strike movement in the entire capitalist world has surged up continuously. Almost all Western European countries have experienced large-scale strike struggles, with the number of participants ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, far more than in previous years. In Italy alone, strikes reached more than 8.8 million person-times in the first eight months, an increase of more than one-third over the previous year. In France, the number of working days lost due to worker strikes in the first quarter was more than the entire previous year. In the United States, nearly 2,000 strikes occurred in the first half of the year, involving 850,000 people. US officials admitted that the scale of the strikes exceeded any similar period in the past four years. Particularly noteworthy is the nearly four-month-long strike launched by 500,000 US steelworkers in the second half of the year, which dealt a heavy blow to the interests of US monopoly capital and the US government's arms expansion and war preparation plans. Faced with the powerful workers' movement, the governments of capitalist countries have even taken forced resumption of work and other violent means to suppress it. But this can only further expose the hypocritical mask of bourgeois "democracy" and "freedom," thereby stimulating the fighting will of the working class and promoting the continued development of class contradictions in capitalist countries.

The National Liberation Movement is Magnificent

The past year was a year of continued great development for the national liberation movement. The storm of anti-colonialist struggle swept across the entire African continent. At the beginning of last year, the people of the Congo first launched a struggle against Belgian colonial rule, followed by a vigorous and heroic anti-colonialist struggle in the black African regions south of the equator, such as Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, Uganda, Kenya, Ruanda-Urundi, Tanganyika, Somaliland, Angola, and Mozambique. The Algerian people's struggle for independence continues to advance victoriously. The National Liberation Army, which had only a few thousand people six years ago, has grown to 150,000. The raging fire burning on the "dark continent" of Africa has accelerated the total collapse of the imperialist colonial system. The London "Times" once described the situation of Western colonialists as: They "have the same psychological state as those who live on the slopes of volcanoes." Indeed, today there are volcanoes everywhere in Africa, with lava erupting at any time. Western colonial rulers cannot but feel that their end is near.

In Latin America, the national democratic movement has also moved forward with great momentum. The Cuban people overthrew the US lackey Batista's dictatorial regime through armed struggle, achieved a great victory in the national democratic revolution, and heroically launched a struggle against US interference and to defend the fruits of the revolution, greatly inspiring the people of various Latin American countries. As a result, from the cold, desolate area of Tierra del Fuego at the southernmost tip of Argentina to the warm Caribbean Sea, a roaring anti-American wave has swept, echoing the angry voice of "Yankee imperialism get out." In La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to hold anti-American demonstrations. The Panamanian people launched a struggle to defend national sovereignty and demand the recovery of the Panama Canal Zone occupied by the United States. Even Puerto Rico, which has long been under strict US control, has erupted in a large-scale anti-American movement. Not long ago, the US "New York Times" exclaimed that "a new wave of nationalism" was "rising" in Latin America and admitted that "the United States has become the target of public criticism." The US "National Guardian" pointed out that "almost none of the twenty republics of Latin America has escaped the painful uprising of increasingly serious resistance." This shows that the largest fortress of world imperialism and the colonial system—the "backyard" of US imperialism—has also become the front line against US imperialism.

In Asia, the movement of various countries to strive for and safeguard national independence continues to develop. The Japanese people's struggle for peace, independence, and democracy has reached an unprecedented scale in history. In order to oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government and the US revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty," they launched ten nationwide unified actions in the past year, constantly giving heavy blows to the Japanese and US reactionaries.

The magnificent national democratic movement spreading across Asia, Africa, and Latin America shows that our era is a great era of complete emancipation for all oppressed nations. Whether it is bloody suppression or threats and inducements, new and old colonialists are doomed to only accelerate their own demise.

The United States is Forced to Find Another "Way Out"

Two years ago, at the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that a new turning point had emerged in human history, that socialist forces had surpassed imperialist forces, and that "the East wind prevails over the West wind." The development of the world situation in the past two years has fully proved the correctness and wisdom of Comrade Mao Zedong's judgment and fully demonstrated its profound significance. After two years, the socialist camp has become even stronger, while imperialism has further declined, thus further changing the balance of world political forces in favor of socialism. Now, socialist forces not only greatly exceed imperialist forces, but are also developing at an even faster rate. This makes it clear to people that "the East wind prevails over the West wind" is by no means an accidental or temporary phenomenon, but an inevitable process of historical development. Once this turning point appears, the decline and demise of imperialism can no longer be reversed. In the past, the "West" represented advancement and the "East" represented backwardness. Now, things have turned to its opposite. The superiority of the socialist system has become so obvious that the most developed capitalist country, the United States, has helplessly put forward the slogan of "catching up with the Soviet Union" for the first time. In the past, imperialism surrounded socialism, and socialism became an isolated island in the world. Now, this situation has completely changed. Because the strength of the socialist camp greatly exceeds imperialism, because of the surging waves of the national liberation movement, and because of the widespread development of the movement of people around the world to ease international tensions and defend peace, it is not socialism that is surrounded, but the war forces of imperialism. Facing this change in the situation, imperialism cannot hide its panic and frustration. US Democratic Party leader Stevenson expressed his concern about capitalist America, saying, "The next decade will truly prove whether such a country can last long. According to current forecasts, the situation is not good." Former US President Truman said: "The Russians are catching up with us, not only because they are constantly advancing, but also because we are regressing." James Mallow, a news analyst for the Associated Press, said more frankly: The "sense of Western superiority has gone forever!"

People around the world who love peace are greatly encouraged by such a good situation. In the past year, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, together with all peace-loving people, have carried out unremitting struggles to strive for the easing of international tensions. In particular, the Soviet Union's firm advocacy of holding an East-West summit meeting to resolve major international disputes, Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States, and the Soviet Union's proposal to the United Nations on complete and thorough disarmament have all made tremendous contributions to the cause of world peace. Under the impact of the tide of peace, the United States also had to change its approach. In the spring of 1959, it was forced to participate in the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference discussing the Berlin issue, and then agreed to the mutual visits of the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States, agreed to hold a summit meeting, and expressed the hope to "thaw the cold war ice." These changes in the United States show the great failure of the war forces and the great victory of the peace forces.

Persist in Struggle, Heighten Vigilance, and Strive for Greater Victory

Some Western bourgeois commentators have a saying that the changes in US foreign policy seem to have started with Dulles's death. But the fact is that, due to the compelling situation, even in the later period when Dulles was Secretary of State, that is, from 1958, some strategic changes in US foreign policy had already shown signs. 1958 was a year of continued great development of socialist forces after "the East wind prevails over the West wind," and also a year in which socialist forces won a great victory after a serious contest with imperialist forces. The leading position of the socialist camp in military strength and science and technology has fundamentally disintegrated the foundation of the US "policy of strength." In particular, the failures suffered by the United States in the Middle East incident and the Taiwan Strait struggle declared the complete bankruptcy of Dulles's "brink of war" policy. The US ruling group understands that since the United States has to retreat in embarrassment when it really reaches the "brink of war," what else can it achieve other than exposing its paper tiger nature in front of the people of the world? At the same time, this policy can only arouse the opposition of the people of the world, making US imperialism the target of public criticism and falling into an extremely isolated position. Faced with stubborn facts, the United States cannot but feel that it is unfavorable and very dangerous for US imperialism itself to attack the socialist camp by means of armed aggression and threats of war, and to create excessive tension with the "brink of war" policy. Therefore, in Dulles's later diplomatic activities, the so-called "peaceful victory" "strategy" had already been put forward. In a speech on December 4, 1958, Dulles quoted Eisenhower as saying: "Free nations face a clear possibility of achieving victory by peaceful means. There is now a noble strategy for achieving victory." After the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite went into the sky, Dulles also said: "Since the current struggle is so fierce, is there room for negotiation? Let me emphasize first that there is room for negotiation. Negotiation is one of the important tools of diplomacy. Abandoning this tool is extremely foolish." It can be seen that Dulles has also felt that it is foolish to clamor for war blindly, and that a "peaceful" strategy is needed to cover up the US war policy and help the United States escape from its predicament. This fully demonstrates the reflection of the situation of "the East wind prevails over the West wind" in US foreign policy.

However, the current changes in US diplomacy are by no means a change in "basic policy." The US ruling group itself does not hide this. Eisenhower has repeatedly emphasized that the "basic goals" of US diplomacy remain unchanged, and that "flexibility is maintained only in terms of tactics, methods, and procedures." Incumbent Vice President and next Republican presidential candidate Nixon even announced that "the West will never accept the Soviet so-called peaceful coexistence." In fact, until today, although the United States has made many "peaceful" remarks, it has never abandoned its policy of aggression and war. The United States is still conducting a cold war, unwilling to disarm, and continuing to establish military blocs and military bases around the world. The United States still insists on reviving West German militarism and still refuses to give up its military occupation of West Berlin. In the Far East, the United States is still actively arming Japan and continuing to occupy China's Taiwan, carrying out activities hostile to the Chinese people and the Asian people. What particularly needs people's attention is that the United States is making a peaceful gesture with one hand, while busy expanding its armaments and stepping up the development of nuclear weapons and missile weapons with the other. Not long ago, a research report by the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that "the increasingly declining military status has made the United States face the greatest danger in its history," and that "the United States must maintain its nuclear retaliatory power as a threat against the Soviet Union, and must have sufficient armed forces to deal with nuclear wars that may occur anywhere in the world that threaten the vital interests of the United States." The report also clamored that the United States must seize the time and strive to shorten the "distance in missiles." To this end, the US government has allocated huge sums of money and reorganized the institutions that produce missiles. According to the "Wall Street Journal," missile funding has greatly increased this year, and the funding spent on just three long-range missiles will reach 10 billion US dollars (the total missile funding last year was 7 billion US dollars, and the year before was 5.3 billion US dollars). At the same time, the United States is actively strengthening aggressive military groups, demanding that its allies "maintain strength" as "diplomatic efforts to solve the cold war problem with the Soviet Union," and demanding that Western European countries increase their burden in "defense" in order to further incorporate the military strength of these countries into the US war plan. In this situation, how can the people of all countries relax their struggle against the US policy of aggression and war?

Of course, although the United States and other imperialist countries are still desperately expanding their armaments and preparing for war, preventing the growth of the world peace trend and the true easing of the international situation, no matter what, the entire world situation will continue to develop in the direction of being beneficial to the forces of peace. As long as the people of the world unite as one, heighten their vigilance, and persist in struggle, the war forces will suffer greater defeats, and peace will be better guaranteed. World history has entered the 1960s of the twentieth century. On this occasion of the new year, let us wish in advance that the cause of world peace and human progress will achieve greater victories in the new year!

    一年来国际局势的回顾
    季平
    编者按：为了更适时地帮助读者分析国际上发生的一些重大事件，我们准备从今年起发表不定期的“时事述评”，以代替过去的“半月国际述评”。
    1959年是东风进一步压倒西风的伟大的一年。国际形势的发展越来越有利于和平力量而不利于战争势力，有利于社会主义而不利于帝国主义。历史的车轮正在朝着这一确定不移的方向继续前进。回顾过去，展望将来，全世界爱好和平和要求进步的人民无不感到无限兴奋，并对自己的前途满怀信心。
    社会主义阵营力量空前强大
    1959年，以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭朝霞万丈，遍地一片大好春光。一年来，社会主义各国取得了国民经济的共同高涨，相互间的团结和合作也有了新的发展，这就使得整个社会主义阵营的力量有了空前未有的增强。
    过去一年，是社会主义各国加速建设共产主义和社会主义的一年。社会主义国家经济高速度发展的规律，导致了经济上的突飞猛进。苏联实行共产主义的宏伟纲领——发展国民经济七年计划的头一年，就旗开得胜，1959年头十一个月的工业生产比1958年同期增长了11．3％，大大超过了七年计划规定的平均年度增长指标。中国在1958年大跃进的基础上继续全面大跃进，人民公社进一步巩固和发展，保证了提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。其他社会主义国家的经济，也同样是高速前进着。1959年上半年的工业生产同1958年同期相比，各国的增长率是：阿尔巴尼亚26．1％，匈牙利9％，保加利亚23．4％，德意志民主共和国12．4％，波兰9．3％，罗马尼亚20．5％，捷克斯洛伐克11％，越南民主共和国62．3％，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国75％，蒙古8．3％。社会主义各国经济的这种全面的高速度发展，充分显示了社会主义制度的优越性。
    特别值得社会主义阵营感到骄傲的是苏联在科学技术方面取得了新的伟大成就，继1957—1958年成功地发射了三个巨大的人造卫星之后，苏联在1959年又发射了三个宇宙火箭，第一个成为太阳系的人造行星，第二个击中了月球，第三个送出了自动行星际站，成功地拍下了人类从来未见过的月球背面照片。这标志着苏联在科学技术方面，攀登了世界的最高峰。
    在社会主义各国政治、经济、科学技术向前发展的过程中，各国人民的精神面貌有了显著的变化。各国党和政府加强了对人民群众的马克思列宁主义的教育，大大提高了他们的共产主义觉悟。在苏联的“共产主义劳动队”，各兄弟国家的“社会主义劳动队”的群众运动中，涌现了成千成万不计报酬地献身于共产主义建设和社会主义建设事业的英雄人物。社会主义制度给劳动人民带来了思想上的大解放，使他们能够充分发挥自己的积极性，创造出各种各样的奇迹。
    帝国主义国家矛盾日益尖锐
    同社会主义阵营各国欣欣向荣、蓬勃发展的情形相反，帝国主义阵营在过去一年继续走着一天天烂下去的下坡路。
    虽然经过1958年经济危机的震荡以后，美国和西欧各国经济在1959年有了某些“回升”，但是，由于生产能力“过剩”，市场相对缩小，通货膨胀严重，财政状况恶化，失业问题无法解决，许多资本主义国家的经济面临重重困难，前景暗淡，危机四伏，日子很不好过。
    一年来资本主义世界在经济上另一个最突出的景象，是各国发展不平衡性更加明显，美国的经济地位大大地下降了。同时，欧洲出现了以西德法国为首的六国“共同市场”和以英国为首的七国“小自由贸易区”两大经济集团，再加上美国的经济势力，鼎足而立，形成激烈的贸易对垒战。在这种情况下，资本主义世界争夺商品市场、投资场所和金融霸权的斗争是更加尖锐了。
    战后，美国的工业生产，曾以占资本主义世界工业生产56．4％的优势，称霸一时。而西欧五国（西德、法、意、荷、比）仅占13．7％。但十几年来，各资本主义国家逐渐从战争的打击中得到恢复，大规模地更新和扩大了固定资本。从1958年到1959年，西欧各主要国家固定资本投资增长了90．9％，同期美国只增加了34．6％。西欧的工业增长速度大大超过了美国。如以1948年的工业生产水平为一百，到1958年，西德上升到382％，法国266％，英国138％，亚洲的日本则增加到434％。而美国只上升到29％。到1958年美国的工业生产在资本主义世界中所占份额已经从1948年的56．4％下降到46．6％，英国由11．7％降到8．2％，西德则由3％上升到10．7％。美国在资本主义世界的出口总额中的份额，也由1947年的34．6％，下降到1958年的23．2％，西德已超过英国的18％，达到18．6％。美国由于出口锐减，又需拨付巨额军事援助和海外军队的开支等等，国际收支出现了逆差，据美官方公布的数字，1959年估计达到四十五亿美元。因而造成黄金大量外流，从1958年1月到1959年8月底，美国外流的黄金已达三十三亿七千万美元之巨，使美国的黄金储备量从1949年占资本主义世界的70％，下降到50％左右。这就不能不大大动摇了“金元帝国”的领导地位。
    在资本主义世界中，经济上发展最快的，是西德和日本。西德的工业生产在1959年已经超过战前1936年的最高水平一倍半，1958年西德工业生产占资本主义世界的10．7％，超过了英国的8．2％，而仅次于美国居于第二位。日本的工业生产，到1959年8月为止，已经达到战前水平的二点七倍。这就大大增强了西德和日本经济竞争的能力，并且由于美帝国主义的一手扶植，重新武装西德和日本，这两个国家的军国主义已迅速复活，开始走上了向外经济扩张的道路。
    经济的矛盾，不能不反映到政治上来。帝国主义一年来的政治上的勾心斗角，也随着尖锐起来。虽则美国竭力想弥补这种裂缝，但是在最近一次北大西洋集团理事会前后，美国希望在其控制下调整“共同市场”和“小自由贸易区”的矛盾，法国要求和美英平分领导权，美国强使法国接受北大西洋集团军备的“一体化”等等，都没有能够解决。这进一步暴露了帝国主义之间的这种根源于利害冲突的矛盾，是不可调和的。
    垄断资本集团总是把竞争加剧和金融危机所造成的损失，转嫁到劳动人民身上，他们想尽一切办法，增加税收，冻结工资，提高物价，解雇工人。在这种情况下，广大劳动人民为生活所迫，坚决地起来反击对他们生活权利的进攻。一年来整个资本主义世界的罢工运动风起云涌，持续不已。西欧各国差不多都发生过规模巨大的罢工斗争，参加的人数从几万人到上百万人，远比往年为多。意大利仅在头八个月里罢工就达到八百多万人次，比前一年全年增加三分之一以上。法国第一季度因工人罢工而损失的工作日就比前一年全年还多。美国上半年就发生了近两千次罢工，参加的达八十五万人。美国官方承认，罢工的规模超过了过去四年的任何同一时期。特别引人注目的是美国五十万钢铁工人下半年开始举行的为期近四个月的大罢工，它给美国垄断资本的利益和美国政府的扩军备战计划以沉重打击。面对着强大的工人运动，资本主义各国政府甚至采取强迫复工和其他暴力手段来进行镇压。但是这只能进一步揭穿资产阶级“民主”“自由”的假面具，从而激励了工人阶级的斗争意志，促使资本主义各国国内的阶级矛盾继续发展。
    民族解放运动气势磅礴
    过去一年是民族解放运动继续大发展的一年。反殖民主义斗争的风暴席卷了整个非洲大陆。去年年初刚果人民首先发动了反抗比利时殖民统治的斗争，接着尼亚萨兰、南北罗得西亚、乌干达、怯尼亚、卢安达—乌隆迪、坦噶尼喀、索马里兰、安哥拉、莫三鼻给等赤道以南的黑非洲地区掀起了轰轰烈烈的反殖民主义的英勇斗争。阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争，不断胜利前进，六年前不过几千人的民族解放军已经发展到十五万人。非洲这个“黑暗大陆”上燃烧起来的燎原烈火，加速了帝国主义殖民制度的总崩溃。伦敦“泰晤士报”曾经描绘西方殖民者的处境说：他们“和那些住在火山斜坡上的人们的心理状态一样”。的确，今天在非洲到处都是火山，随时都有溶岩迸发，西方的殖民统治者已经不能不感到末日将至了。
    在拉丁美洲，民族民主运动也以磅礴之势向前发展。古巴人民通过武装斗争推翻了美国走狗巴蒂斯塔的独裁政权，取得了民族民主革命的伟大胜利，并且英勇地展开了反对美国干涉、保卫革命成果的斗争，大大地鼓舞了拉丁美洲各国的人民。影响所及，从阿根廷的最南端的火地岛的寒冷的荒漠地带到暖和的加勒比海，呼啸起一片反美的惊涛骇浪，响彻着“美帝国主义滚出去”的愤怒的声音。在玻利维亚首都拉巴斯，成万人走上街头举行反美示威。巴拿马人民展开了保卫国家主权要求收回美国占领下的巴拿马运河区的斗争。甚至连美国长期严密控制下的波多黎各也爆发了声势浩大的反美运动。前不久，美国“纽约时报”惊呼“民族主义的新浪潮”在拉丁美洲“高涨起来”，并且承认“美国成了众矢之的”。美国“国民前卫报”指出，拉丁美洲二十个共和国“几乎没有一个逃过反抗日益严重的痛苦的起义”。这表明，世界帝国主义和殖民制度的最大的堡垒——美帝国主义的“后院”也已经成为反对美帝国主义的前线。
    在亚洲，各国人民争取和维护民族独立的运动同样继续开展。日本人民争取和平、独立、民主的斗争达到了历史上空前未有的规模。他们为了反对岸信介政府和美国修改日美“安全条约”，过去一年中展开了十次全国统一行动，不断给日美反动派以沉重的打击。
    遍及亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的波澜壮阔的民族民主运动，表明了我们这个时代是一切被压迫民族彻底大翻身的伟大的时代。新旧殖民主义者，不管是用血腥镇压，还是威胁利诱，都注定了只会加速自己的死亡。
    美国被逼另找“出路”
    两年以前，在伟大十月革命四十周年的时候，毛泽东同志曾经指出，人类历史出现了一个新的转折点，社会主义力量已经超过帝国主义力量，“东风压倒西风”。两年来世界形势的发展，完全证明了毛泽东同志这个论断的正确和英明，并且充分地显示了它的深刻意义。经过两年的时间，社会主义阵营是更加强大了，而帝国主义则进一步走向衰亡，从而使世界政治力量对比发生了有利于社会主义的进一步变化。现在，社会主义力量不但大大超过帝国主义力量，而且正以更快的速度向前发展。这就使人们清楚地看到，“东风压倒西风”决不是偶然的、暂时的现象，而是历史发展的必然过程。这个转折点一经出现，帝国主义的颓势和衰亡就再也无法挽回了。过去，“西方”代表先进，“东方”代表落后，现在，事情正好转化到它的反面。社会主义制度的优越性已经这样明显，以致最发达的资本主义国家美国无可奈何地第一次提出了“赶上苏联”的口号。过去，是帝国主义包围社会主义，社会主义成为世界的孤岛，现在这种形势也完全改观了。由于社会主义阵营的力量大大超过帝国主义，由于民族解放运动的波涛汹涌，由于全世界人民要求缓和国际紧张局势和保卫和平的运动有了广泛的发展，被包围的已经不是社会主义，而是帝国主义的战争势力。面对着这种形势的变化，帝国主义无法掩盖他们的慌恐和沮丧。美国民主党领袖史蒂文森对于资本主义的美国表示担心地说：“未来的十年将真正证明这样一个国家能不能长久维持下去，根据现在的预测，情况却不妙。”美国前总统杜鲁门说：“俄国人正在赶上我们，这不仅是因为他们正在不断前进，而且也因为我们正在倒退。”美联社新闻分析员詹姆斯·马劳说得更坦率：对于“西方优势的感觉，已经一去不复返了！”
    全世界爱好和平的人民，面对着这样大好形势，感到极大的鼓舞。过去的一年中，苏联和其他社会主义国家同一切爱好和平人民一起，为了争取缓和国际紧张局势，进行了坚持不懈的斗争。特别是苏联坚决主张举行东西方最高级会议，解决当前重大国际争端，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国，以及苏联向联合国提出的关于全面彻底裁军的建议，都对世界和平事业作出了巨大的贡献。在和平潮流的冲击下，美国也不得不改变做法，它在1959年春天被迫参加了讨论柏林问题的日内瓦外长会议，接着又同意苏美两国首脑互相访问，同意召开最高级会议，并且表示希望“融解冷战冰块”。美国的这些变化，表明了战争势力的大失败，和平力量的大胜利。
    坚持斗争提高警惕  争取更大的胜利
    西方资产阶级评论家有一种说法，似乎美国外交政策的变化，是从杜勒斯之死开始的。但事实是，由于形势逼人，还在杜勒斯担任国务卿的后期，即从1958年开始，美国外交政策的某些策略上的改变就已露端倪。1958年，这是在“东风压倒西风”之后，社会主义力量继续大发展的一年，也是社会主义力量经过同帝国主义力量的严重较量而获得伟大胜利的一年。社会主义阵营在军事力量以及科学技术方面的遥遥领先的地位，使美国的“实力政策”的基础从根本上瓦解了。特别是美国在中东事件和台湾海峡斗争中遭到的失败，宣告了杜勒斯“战争边缘”政策的彻底破产。美国统治集团懂得，既然当美国真正走到“战争边缘”时，又不得不狼狈地退下来，那么这除了在全世界人民面前暴露自己的纸老虎本相之外，还有什么结果呢？同时，这种政策又只能激起全世界人民的反对，使美帝国主义成为众矢之的，陷于极端孤立的地位。在顽强的事实面前，美国不能不感觉到，用武装侵略和战争威胁的办法来进攻社会主义阵营，用“战争边缘”政策来制造过分的紧张局势，首先对美帝国主义自己是不利的，而且是非常危险的。因此，在杜勒斯的后期外交活动中，就已经提出所谓“和平致胜”的“战略”。杜勒斯在1958年12月4日的演说中引证艾森豪威尔的话说：“在自由国家面前摆着用和平手段取得胜利的明显的可能性。现在存在有一种获得胜利的高尚战略。”在苏联第二个人造卫星上天之后，杜勒斯还说过：“既然目前的斗争那样激烈，是不是有谈判的余地呢？首先让我强调说，谈判的余地是有的。谈判是外交的重要工具之一。放弃这个工具就是愚蠢透顶。”可见，杜勒斯也已经感到，一味地叫嚣战争是愚蠢的，需要有一种“和平”战略来掩盖美国的战争政策，并帮助美国脱出进退维谷的处境。这充分表现了“东风压倒西风”的形势在美国外交政策上的反映。
    但是，目前美国在外交上的某些变化，决不是“基本政策”的改变。关于这一点，美国统治集团自己也并不隐讳。艾森豪威尔曾经一再强调美国外交的“基本目标”不变，而仅仅“在策略、方法和程序方面保持灵活性”。现任副总统和下届共和党总统候选人尼克松甚至宣布，“西方决不接受苏联所谓的和平共处”。事实上，直到今天为止，美国虽然讲了不少“和平”的论调，但是始终没有放弃它的侵略政策和战争政策。美国仍然进行冷战，不愿意裁军，并继续在世界各地建立军事集团和军事基地。美国仍然坚持复活西德军国主义，仍然不肯放弃对西柏林的军事占领。在远东，美国仍然积极武装日本，继续霸占中国的台湾，进行敌视中国人民和亚洲人民的活动。特别需要人们注意的是，美国一只手做出和平姿态，另一只手却在忙于扩张军备，加紧发展核武器和导弹武器。不久以前，美国参议院外交委员会的一篇研究报告说，“日益衰落的军事地位使美国面临它历史上最大的危险”，“美国必须保持它的核报复力量，作为对付苏联的力量的一种威胁力量，而且必须有足够的武装部队来对付世界任何地方发生的可能使美国的切身利益受到威胁的核战争”。这个报告并且大声疾呼美国要争取时间，力求缩短“导弹方面的距离”。为此，美国政府已经拨出巨款，并且改组了生产导弹的机构。据“华尔街日报”透露，本年度导弹经费大为增加，仅仅花在三种远程导弹上的经费就将达一百亿美元（去年度全部导弹经费为七十亿美元，前年度为五十三亿美元）。同时，美国正在积极加强侵略性的军事集团，要求它的盟国“保持实力”作为“同苏联解决冷战问题的外交努力”，并要求西欧国家增加“防御”方面的负担，以便把这些国家的军事力量进一步纳入美国的战争计划中。在这种情况下，各国人民怎么能够放松对于美国侵略政策和战争政策的斗争呢？
    当然，尽管美国和其他帝国主义国家还在拚命扩军备战，阻止世界和平潮流的增长和国际局势的真正缓和，但是，无论如何，整个世界形势仍将继续向着有利于和平力量的方向发展。只要全世界人民团结一致，提高警惕，坚持斗争，战争势力就将遭到更大的失败，和平将得到更大的保障。世界历史已经进入二十世纪的六十年代，在此岁序更新之际，让我们预祝世界和平和人类进步事业将在新的一年获得更大的胜利！
