    Please Film Travelogue-Style Movies
    I very much enjoy traveling to famous cities in the motherland, and I also want to know their history, changes, and development. Even if I don't have the opportunity to visit them in person, I feel very interested in reading relevant materials, travelogues, or reports. Recently, the People's Daily has launched the "Ode to Famous Cities" column, continuously publishing articles praising the changes in various famous cities of the motherland over the past ten years. Reading those enthusiastic articles makes me even more yearn for the famous cities of the motherland. After watching the documentary "Lanzhou Ten Years," it occurred to me that if film studios could shoot a series of documentary films like "Ode to Famous Cities," audiences could almost travel around the country while sitting in the cinema. Therefore, I suggest filming such travelogue-style movies, providing more detailed and artistically enhanced introductions to local scenic spots, historical sites, and local characteristics to satisfy the audience's demands.

    请拍游记性质的影片
    我很喜欢游历祖国的名城，也很想知道它们的沿革、变迁和发展，即使还没有机会亲身去拜访，翻阅一些有关的资料或是读一读游记或报道，也感到津津有味。近来，人民日报开辟了“名城赋”专栏，连续刊载着讴歌祖国各个名城十年来的变化，读了那些热情洋溢的文章、祖国的名城更加令人神往。看了纪录片“兰州十年”以后，使我想到，如果电影制片厂拍摄一组像“名城赋”那样的纪录影片。观众坐在影院里就几乎可以周游全国了。因此，我建议拍摄这类游记性的影片，对当地的名胜、古迹、地方特色等方面，作较详实的艺术性较强的介绍，以满意观众的要求。
