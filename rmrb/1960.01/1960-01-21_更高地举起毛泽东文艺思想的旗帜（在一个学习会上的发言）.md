Hold the Banner of Mao Zedong's Literary and Art Thought Higher
(Speech at a Study Session)
Lin Mohan

Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist thinker and theorist. He combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, not only leading the Chinese people to achieve revolutionary victory and change the face of our country, but also creatively developing Marxism-Leninism. Whether in philosophy, political economy, or the theory of scientific socialism, he has made significant creative developments. In the field of literature and art, Comrade Mao Zedong also developed Marxist literary and artistic thought, giving Marxist literary and artistic thought a complete systematicness, high scientificity, and strong combat effectiveness.

Different classes and people with different standpoints adopt different attitudes towards Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. One is to support it, which is the majority. One is to oppose it. There are also some who underestimate it, and there are quite a few of these people as well. Those who support it certainly recognize the significance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, but the degree of recognition may vary. Those who oppose it harbor deep hatred for Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. Why do they hate it so much? This is because they feel from their class instincts that Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought is a very sharp weapon, which is very unfavorable to bourgeois ideology and the bourgeois world view. Therefore, they try every means to abolish Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. They simply hate it to the core. Hu Feng elements cursed "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as a "totem," saying "it can slaughter living beings." But they knew that open opposition was very difficult, so they adopted two methods. One was, like Hu Feng, to teach his followers to adopt a method that superficially followed it but was essentially opposed to it. Others desperately tried to revise it to make Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought conform to their bourgeois views. Rightists such as Xu Maoyong and Qin Zhaoyang did just that. Xu Maoyong wrote an article entitled "An Outdated Commemoration" on the fifteenth anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" (hereinafter referred to as "Talks"), which was a typical article revising Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. Xu Maoyong even openly promoted human nature theory and advocated exposing and satirizing the people themselves in an article commemorating the "Talks." In the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," there is a very good editor's note that says: Some people "hold bourgeois literary and artistic views, so they cannot recognize the importance of this speech. However, Zhang Zhongxiao, a Hu Feng element, with his counter-revolutionary sensitivity, deeply understands that this speech will grasp the masses on a wider scale after the national liberation and will have a destructive effect on various reactionary literary and artistic thoughts, so they are eager to prevent and destroy the expansion of the influence of this speech." This editor's note clearly explains why some people oppose or attempt to revise Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought.

Facts have proved that Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought has brought about a completely new face to our literature and art. The reason why our literary and artistic work has achieved such great success in the ten years since liberation is that we have implemented the literary and artistic policies formulated by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, defended Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and that Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought has been increasingly widely grasped by the masses, and first of all, the majority of literary and artistic workers have accepted Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought. This is the most fundamental reason for our victory.

How did Comrade Mao Zedong develop Marxist literary and artistic thought? I have not done in-depth research on this issue, and can only say a little about my own feelings and experiences in studying. If there are any errors, please criticize and correct them.

To explain how Comrade Mao Zedong developed Marxist literary and artistic thought, one must first give a very rough account of the literary and artistic thought of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. I have read very little in this area, and it is not only impossible to say it completely, but there may also be misunderstandings.

The era in which Marx and Engels lived was an era in which the working class had already stepped onto the historical stage, but the proletarian revolution had not yet matured. The Paris Commune demonstrated the soaring revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, but it quickly failed. In Lenin's words, this was a time when "the revolutionary nature of the bourgeois democrats had already declined, while the revolutionary nature of the proletarian socialists had not yet matured." At this time, no true proletarian writers had yet emerged. Those who were active in the same period as Marx and Engels, who were praised by Marx and Engels, or who had direct contact with them, were probably writers such as: One type is writers like Balzac. Balzac's literary activity was earlier than Marx's activity, but before Balzac's death in 1850, Marx had already begun his revolutionary and writing activities. Marx and Engels praised Balzac because Balzac profoundly exposed the essence of capitalist society and the law of money dominating everything in capitalist society. Balzac used images, vivid characters, and events to expose the cruel phenomena of capitalist society that Marx and Engels had exposed in scientific language in the "Communist Manifesto." But we know that Balzac was not a proletarian writer. He stood on the position of regretting the demise of the aristocracy to expose the cruelty and ugliness of capitalist society, and proved the inevitability of the demise of aristocratic society and the emergence of capitalist society. The second type of writer can said to be revolutionary democrats or democratic writers with socialist illusions, such as Heine and George Sand. Marx had a very good relationship with Heine and also admired George Sand. Marx liked them because they sympathized with the laboring people and protested against the unjust phenomena in society. Of course, they were not proletarian writers either. Heine, for example, did not understand true communism. The third type of writer appeared later in time, mainly those who interacted with Engels, such as Minna Kautsky (Kautsky's mother) and Harkness. They called themselves socialists, but they were actually petty-bourgeois socialists. They sympathized with workers, but did not truly know or understand them. Because of the era in which Marx and Engels lived, because there were no true proletarian writers at that time, and also because the literary works of that time were "mainly for the readers of the bourgeois circles" (Engels), Marx and Engels could only put forward the following propositions and requirements at that time.

First, they demanded that literary works "truthfully describe the real relations, break the traditional illusions about the nature of these relations, smash the optimism of the bourgeois world, and arouse a permanent doubt about the existing order." If it can be done this way, this is a useful work, and this novel can be considered to have "completed its mission" (Engels). At that time, they could only make such demands on most authors. In connection with this view, Marx was very disgusted with the poems of some so-called "true socialists" in Germany at that time, because those so-called "true socialists" were actually some petty-bourgeois writers, and their poems were actually embellishing the capitalist system and consolidating the capitalist system.

Second, they demanded that writers reflect the lives of the working class. Engels proposed that "the revolutionary resistance of the working class to the environment that oppresses them, their tense attempts to restore their human status... can demand a place in the realm of realism," because the working class's struggle against oppression and for liberation has already "belonged to a part of history." Engels believed that their struggle should be expressed in realistic literature.

Third, they further demanded that literary works not only reflect the lives and struggles of the working class, but also correctly portray the working class, and should not describe the working class as a passive mass that cannot save themselves, and does not even attempt to save themselves. Believing that the liberation of the working class is the cause of the working class itself, and does not rely on any gods or heroes: This is the basic principle of Marxism, and it is one of the main differences between it and all utopian socialists and petty-bourgeois socialists. Utopian socialists sympathize with the working class, but do not believe that the working class can liberate themselves. They want to liberate the working class from the outside or from above. Engels was dissatisfied with Harkness's work because she portrayed the working class, who had undergone decades of struggle and training, as a completely passive mass. Engels believed that although there were still many backward workers, from the perspective of the entire era environment, this description was atypical.

Marx and Engels expressed many valuable opinions in the field of literature and art, which are still worth studying and learning repeatedly today. They expressed ardent expectations for the future proletarian literature, which is also a great encouragement to later generations. However, in the era of Marx and Engels, it was impossible to put forward the slogan of "proletarian literature," and it was even more impossible to clearly put forward the principle of the Party spirit of literature. This was only possible in the time of Lenin. Lenin's famous article "Party Organization and Party Literature" laid the ideological foundation of proletarian literature and for the first time clearly put forward the slogan of proletarian literature and the principle of the Party spirit of literature.

The article "Party Organization and Party Literature" was written after the first Russian Revolution of 1905. Compared with the era in which Marx and Engels lived, the world proletarian revolutionary movement had greatly developed at this time. The 1905 Revolution was the first serious blow of the Russian working class to the Tsarist autocracy. Although the revolution was not victorious, the situation in Russia at that time was, as Lenin said, that the revolution was not yet strong enough to defeat the Tsarist system, and the Tsarist system was no longer strong enough to defeat the revolution. The article begins by saying: "The new conditions of Social Democratic work created in Russia after the October Revolution (referring to the All-Russian political strike in October 1905 - translator) have brought the question of Party literature to the agenda." These so-called "new conditions," in addition to the upsurge of the workers' movement, were also due to the Tsarist government having to make some concessions, implement reforms for the people, and give the people some freedom of publication and association. In the past, "there was a distinction between illegal newspapers and legal newspapers," and "all illegal newspapers were Party newspapers." Now, Party newspapers can be legally published, so Lenin pointed out that literature must have a clear Party spirit in order to avoid confusion with those vague and incomplete things.

It was under such conditions that Lenin first proposed that literature should become Party literature. Lenin said: "What is the principle of this Party literature? It is not only to say that for the socialist proletariat, literary work cannot be a tool for individuals or groups to make money, but fundamentally cannot be a personal affair unrelated to the overall cause of the proletariat... Literary work should become a part of the overall cause of the proletariat... It should become an integral part of the organized, planned, and unified work of the Social Democratic Party." Therefore, literary work must accept the supervision of the Party. In this article, Lenin refuted the bourgeois argument of so-called "freedom of creation." He said that, first, bourgeois writers and artists cannot be free from bourgeois publishers, cannot get rid of dependence on moneybags, dependence on being bought, and dependence on being raised. The "freedom of creation" they talk about is nothing but a deception. Second, writers have the freedom to write anything they want, but the Party also has the freedom to "drive away those who use the Party's banner to promote anti-Party views." You have freedom of speech, and the Party has freedom of association and freedom to protect the purity of the Party. At the same time, Lenin explained that only proletarian literature is truly free literature, because it is literature created by conscious elements voluntarily serving the laboring people, literature serving hundreds of millions of people, and literature free from the shackles of bourgeois individualism. Lenin also pointed out that advocating Party literature should never obliterate individual creativity; it must not rigidly equate the literary part of the proletarian Party's cause with other parts of the proletarian Party's cause.

Another important idea of Lenin's is that in his conversation with the German female revolutionary Zetkin, he clearly pointed out that literature and art belong to the people, must serve hundreds of millions of laboring people, and must be understood and loved by them. He said, "When the workers and peasants still lack black bread, are we going to send exquisite biscuits to a few people?" He believed that literature and art must be sent to the masses, and the best art must be sent to the masses. "Our workers and peasants deserve better things than the circus. They have the right to enjoy truly great art."

Also, as everyone knows, Lenin put forward the theory of two cultures. Lenin pointed out that "in every national culture, there are two national cultures." One is "the culture of Russian priests and the bourgeoisie," and the other is "the culture of Great Russian democrats and Social Democrats." He also pointed out that the proletariat must absorb and transform everything valuable in the development of human thought and culture.

Proletarian literature and art must be the literature and art of the Party, must serve the workers and peasants, and at the same time, must correctly treat the cultural heritage. This is the main content of Lenin's literary and artistic thought. Obviously, in Lenin's time, the ideas of the Party spirit and mass character of proletarian literature and art had been clearly established. The great Soviet literature, the literature of socialist realism, is precisely a regular development of Lenin's early propositions and demands.

Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought creatively developed Lenin's literary and artistic thought, which is concentratedly expressed in Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was produced under such circumstances. On the one hand, the world anti-fascist war and the national people's war of resistance against Japan were entering a difficult stage of stalemate. On the other hand, the revolutionary forces led by the Party were unprecedentedly strong, and the working class not only had their own armed forces, but also had their own base areas. A large number of writers and artists arrived in the base areas. What appeared before them were new masses, new "objects of description and recipients of works." Should writers and artists express new masses, new ideas, and new emotions and serve new masses? Or should they continue to express the old characters, old ideas, and old emotions they liked and cater to old readers? This was the question facing writers and artists at that time. Many writers and artists did not solve this problem. They still treated the masses and the cause of literature and art with the old world view and old ideas and emotions, so they could not but have sharp contradictions with the new environment, the new masses, and the new requirements for literature and art. If this problem is not solved, literature and art cannot correctly develop forward, and not only cannot serve the revolution, but may even harm the revolution. The Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art was convened under such circumstances to solve this contradiction.

Lenin proposed that literature and art must be a part of the Party's cause and must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, how can one truly become the literature and art of the Party, and how can one truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers? Lenin did not have time to explain this in detail. Thoroughly solving these problems is Comrade Mao Zedong's great contribution. Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is a most complete scientific document of Marxist literary and artistic thought. It points out the most explicit path for the development of proletarian socialist literature and art, and creatively solves a series of fundamental problems of Marxist literary and artistic thought.

Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought is so rich that every time we reread Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and his other discourses on literature and art, we can gain new inspiration and new education. Therefore, it is impossible to explain all his thoughts in this speech. I think, can it be said that the most important thing is to solve the following most fundamental problems.

First, Comrade Mao Zedong thoroughly solved the relationship between literature and art and revolution. "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" begins by saying that the purpose of holding the forum is to "study the relationship between literary and artistic work and general revolutionary work, and seek better assistance from revolutionary literature and art to other revolutionary work, in order to defeat the enemies of our nation and complete the task of national liberation." On this point, Comrade Mao Zedong developed Lenin's thought, believing that literature and art should "well become a component part of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy, helping the people to fight the enemy with one heart and one mind." "Literature and art are subordinate to politics, but in turn give great influence to politics." The relationship between literary and artistic work and the Party's entire work is that revolutionary literature and art are a part of the entire revolutionary cause, and are the gears and screws of the entire machine. It should be subordinate to the task of revolution. This is the most fundamental principle. The most important difference between us and bourgeois writers and artists is that they always intentionally or unintentionally use the banner of "art for art's sake" to cover up their political goals, while we openly advocate art for revolution. Since literature is a part of the Party's entire revolutionary cause, it must of course accept the Party's leadership and supervision. Denying that literary and artistic work is a part of the entire revolutionary cause will inevitably lead to rejecting the Party's leadership over literature and art, and will lead to, like Wang Shiwei, believing that it is not politics that leads art, but art that leads politics, or like the Yugoslav revisionists, believing that there is a "contradictory contradiction" between "art and the state."

Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out that literature and art are a part of the entire revolutionary cause, but it is an indispensable part, and it is an indispensable gear and screw for the entire machine. "If there is no literature and art at all, even in the broadest and most general sense, the revolutionary movement cannot be carried out and cannot be victorious." That is to say, literature and art are not a dispensable part, but an active part that promotes the revolutionary cause and the entire machine. Precisely because of this, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always attached great importance to literary and artistic work. This is not due to personal hobbies, but because literature and art have a great influence on the broad masses and play a great role in the revolutionary cause. If it is correct, it can play a good role; if it goes the wrong way, it can play a bad role. Precisely because of this, Comrade Mao Zedong proposed that the political standard must be the first standard for measuring literary and artistic works. He said, "There are two criteria for literary and artistic criticism, one is the political standard and the other is the artistic standard." The relationship between the two is "putting the political standard in the first place and the artistic standard in the second place." Political standard first means that for literary and artistic works, the first thing to look at is whether it is beneficial or harmful to the revolutionary cause. If you admit that literature and art are to serve the revolution, you will inevitably admit the critical standard of politics first. Denying the critical standard of politics first is essentially denying that literature and art should serve the revolution.

Second, Comrade Mao Zedong solved the relationship between literature and art and the masses. On this issue, Comrade Mao Zedong also developed Lenin's thought. As Lenin said, past literature was "writers write, readers read." Writers of the old era neither considered whether to express the workers, peasants, and soldiers, nor considered whether their works were accepted by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, proletarian literature cannot but consider this new issue. This is what Comrade Mao Zedong said, your "objects of description and recipients of works" are different. Comrade Mao Zedong clearly solved the problem of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and how to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is the most important issue and the main part of his speech.

Literature and art serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, mainly in the following aspects: that is, writers must observe and describe things from the standpoint of the proletariat; that is, they must strive to express the workers, peasants, and soldiers; that is, they must strengthen the unity of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, rather than alienate them; that is, they must guide people to approach the workers, peasants, and soldiers, rather than leave the workers, peasants, and soldiers. How to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers is to achieve the purpose of service through the correct combination of popularization and improvement. Comrade Mao Zedong dialectically stipulated the correct relationship between popularization and improvement: improvement on the basis of popularization, popularization under the guidance of improvement. Whether it is popularization or improvement, it is for the purpose of serving the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. It serves both the needs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers today and their needs tomorrow. Unilaterally emphasizing improvement and neglecting popularization is wrong and divorced from the masses. It is also inappropriate to only pay attention to popularization and neglect improvement. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, "Some excellent works also have the possibility of popularization now," and at the same time, "the cultural level of the broad masses is also constantly improving... The people demand popularization, and then they also demand improvement, and they demand improvement year by year and month by month." At the same time, Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out that in order to serve the broad masses, it is also necessary to serve the cadres among the masses. Although they are a minority, they are the cadres of the masses and the advanced elements among the masses. "Serving the cadres is also completely serving the masses, because only through the cadres can the masses be educated and guided." Therefore, this "improvement needed by the cadres" is "indirectly the improvement needed by the masses." "It is wrong to ignore this point."

While solving the relationship between popularization and improvement, Comrade Mao Zedong also solved the relationship between specialists and popularizers, as well as the relationship between professional creation and mass amateur creation. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that "we should respect specialists, and specialists are very valuable to our cause." However, specialists should contact the masses and pay attention to the masses' wall newspapers, correspondence literature, mass singing, and mass art. "On the one hand, help them and guide them, and on the other hand, learn from them." If they regard themselves as "aristocrats high above the 'lower class,' then no matter how talented they are, they are not needed by the masses, and their work has no future."

Comrade Mao Zedong's series of regulations correctly solved the direction, methods, and paths of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Third, Comrade Mao Zedong solved the relationship between art and life. Comrade Mao Zedong solved the relationship between art and life well based on dialectical materialism. First of all, human social life is the only source of literature and art. All literary and artistic works are reflections of life. "There can only be such a source, and there cannot be a second source." Therefore, literature and art must never be separated from life, and "hardly copy and imitate" from the works of the ancients and the foreigners. Secondly, "as an ideological form, literary and artistic works are all products of the reflection of a certain social life in the human mind." Life is reflected through people's minds, and it cannot but be affected by their world view and ideological stance. Everyone's mind reflects life, but not everyone can correctly reflect life. Only those who have a correct world view and a correct ideological stance can correctly reflect life. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong said, “Revolutionary literature and art are the products of the reflection of people’s lives in the minds of revolutionary writers.” The same people's lives, reflected in the minds of reactionary writers, will not be revolutionary literature and art, but counter-revolutionary literature and art. Thirdly, since literary and artistic works are the products of the reflection of people's lives in the minds of writers, it means that they must go through the writer's analysis, selection, judgment, and generalization. Therefore, “The life reflected in literary and artistic works can and should be higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than ordinary actual life, and therefore more universal.” This reflection cannot be purely objective, but is the result of the writer’s selection, analysis, and judgment. Therefore, in turn, literature and art can play a role in promoting and promoting life. Life is the source of literature and art. Literature and art come from life, and at the same time literature and art are higher than life. Therefore, they can in turn influence life and promote life. This is Comrade Mao Zedong's basic view on the relationship between literature and art and life.

Fourth, Comrade Mao Zedong solved the relationship between writers and the masses well. To solve the problem of literature and art serving the revolution and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to correctly reflect the lives of the people, the most fundamental key is that literary and artistic workers must combine with the masses, transform their thinking in the combination with the masses, and at the same time obtain the source of creation. This is an important viewpoint in Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that as long as writers and artists are determined to learn Marxist theory, and go deep into revolutionary struggle for a long time and become one with the masses, and repeatedly combine theory with practice, they can achieve the effect of transforming old ideas and establishing a proletarian world view. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the bright path for writers and artists to contact the masses and transform their thinking, which is an extremely important contribution. On this point, many writers in our country have deep feelings. Since proletarian literature and art are a completely new kind of literature and art, its ideological viewpoints, its objects of description, and its objects of service are all different from the literature and art of the old era, writers and artists cannot follow the old path of writers and artists of the old era. Only by solving this problem can there be truly socialist literature and art.

Fifth, Comrade Mao Zedong solved the relationship between literature and art and national cultural traditions. Proletarian literature and art did not fall from the sky. It must be built on the existing traditional base. Comrade Mao Zedong developed Lenin's theory of "two national cultures." First, we must scientifically analyze the cultural traditions of our nation. In the cultural heritage, there are both democratic and revolutionary things, and feudal and reactionary things. We should "eliminate its feudal dross and absorb its democratic essence." The tradition should be studied from the perspective of historical materialism and given its due historical status. We oppose both cutting off history and not wanting tradition, and oppose praising the old and belittling the present, and bowing down before tradition. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that our purpose of critically inheriting tradition is to promote China's new culture; it is to reform and create, not to follow the old ways and let tradition hold back our progress; it is to guide people to look forward, not backward. Comrade Mao Zedong used the phrase "bring forth the new through the old" to most succinctly and vividly express the dialectical relationship between criticism, inheritance, and innovation and creation.

Comrade Mao Zedong wants us to critically study and absorb everything useful from foreign countries, but after learning from foreign countries, we must integrate it with our national things and make it have national characteristics. Literature and art are different from certain technical sciences. The object of technical science is the laws of nature, while literature and art are the expression of people's lives, thoughts, and feelings. It is impossible for it not to have national characteristics. Our literature and art must have their own national characteristics and national style, and must "innovate": innovate the newness of the nation and establish the uniqueness of the nation. Only in this way can it be loved by the people and make our nation's unique contribution to world culture.

In a word, learning from the ancients is for the living people of the present, and learning from foreigners is for the Chinese people of today. All ideas of blindly worshiping foreigners and blindly worshiping the ancients are extremely harmful.

The above-mentioned points, I think, are the most fundamental problems in literature and art. Comrade Mao Zedong solved these fundamental problems extremely correctly, comprehensively, systematically, and dialectically.

In the ten years since the national liberation, under the new situation and conditions, Comrade Mao Zedong has continued to creatively develop Marxist literary and artistic thought. I think the most important aspects are the following:

First, Comrade Mao Zedong attaches great importance to the struggle between the two roads on the literary and artistic front. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the literary and artistic circles carried out a series of struggles. Starting with the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun," criticism of "A Study of The Dream of the Red Chamber," criticism of Hu Shi's thought, the struggle against the Hu Feng clique, the struggle against the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique, the anti-rightist struggle in the literary and artistic circles, and the struggle against revisionism, the fundamental problem is the struggle between two world views, the struggle between the proletarian world view and the bourgeois world view. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out that many of our comrades are fundamentally unable to distinguish between what is revolutionary and what is reactionary, what is new and what is old, what should be praised and what should be opposed. Just over a year after the national liberation, Comrade Mao Zedong noticed the issue of the struggle between the two roads in the ideological field. However, many comrades in the literary and artistic circles did not fully realize the significance of this series of ideological struggles in the literary and artistic circles, and did not realize that this is a part of the class struggle on the entire ideological front, a struggle of who will win whom in literary and artistic thought, a struggle of whether to have proletarian literature and art or bourgeois literature and art, and a struggle of what kind of thought to use to cultivate the literary and artistic team. Only after such a series of struggles can proletarian literature and art be established and the productive forces of the literary and artistic circles be liberated. As Comrade Zhou Yang said in "A Great Debate on the Literary and Artistic Front": These struggles "gave a fatal blow to bourgeois reactionary thought, liberated the productive forces of the literary and artistic circles and its reserve army, removed the shackles imposed on them by the old society, eliminated the threat of reactionary air, and opened up a broad road for the development of proletarian literature and art." This analysis is very correct and completely in line with reality. Let us recall what the situation was in the literary and artistic circles before these struggles were carried out. At that time, some Party member writers could openly promote bourgeois individualism and openly oppose the leadership of the Party. Many writers and artists did not try to get closer to the Party and integrate with the people, but became increasingly alienated from the Party and isolated from the masses. Some young writers quickly became corrupted by bourgeois ideas as soon as they came out, and many people fell under the influence of Hu Feng and Ding Ling. Some comrades actually adopted a bystander attitude towards this series of struggles. They did not have the proletarian anger towards hostile things, and they could stand by and watch Hu Feng madly attack the Party and socialism. They claimed to be old Party members and supporters of Chairman Mao, but they did not stand up to fight when Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought was attacked and slandered. They fundamentally forgot that they were Communists and should stand up to defend the Party's line and defend Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. There were also other comrades who participated in these struggles, but could not fully estimate the significance of these struggles. They did not see that the achievements of literary and artistic work are inseparable from these struggles. Without these struggles, the productive forces of literary and artistic circles cannot be liberated. Therefore, some articles, when talking about the achievements of literary and artistic work in the past ten years, downplayed the significance of ideological struggle, and only mentioned a few words, and instead emphasized the opposition to the simplification and vulgar sociology of ideological struggle or reader discussions. We do not deny that there have been shortcomings of simplification and vulgar sociology in ideological struggle, especially in the critical opinions of young readers, but this is not the main aspect, and it is temporarily unavoidable in mass criticism. However, according to the views of this type of article, the task today is not to continue to carry out ideological struggle against revisionism, but mainly to oppose vulgar sociology. This is completely wrong. "Great Achievements and Development of New Chinese Literature" (see the October 1959 issue of the journal) is a typical article. This article as a whole praises the achievements of new Chinese literature, but it fundamentally forgets that there are still class contradictions in our society, forgets that there are still hostile ideas in the literary and artistic circles, and forgets that ideological struggle must be carried out for a long time. This is very dangerous, and this is often the root of revisionism and is extremely harmful. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The struggle between socialism and capitalism in our country in the ideological field will still take a considerable period of time to resolve. This is because the influence of the bourgeoisie and intellectuals from the old society will still exist in our country for a long time, and as the ideology of the class, it will still exist in our country for a long time. If we are not sufficiently aware of this situation, or do not recognize it at all, we will make great mistakes and will ignore the necessary ideological struggle." In the ten years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the struggle between the two roads and the two world views has been carried out on the literary and artistic front. After such struggles, the leading position of Marxism has been basically established in the literary and artistic circles.

Second, "Let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." This is the Marxist policy for developing academic culture and literature and art under the new situation and new conditions, and it is an extremely firm class policy of the proletariat. Our Party proposed this policy in 1956 because: First, the socialist transformation in the economy had been basically completed, and at the same time, after a series of ideological struggles, Marxism had established a leading position in the ideological field. Second, there are still bourgeois ideas among the people, as well as class contradictions and other different ideas in ideology. For these different ideas, only by adopting the policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" to let them be published, and after free criticism and free discussion, using persuasion instead of coercion, can it be more conducive to resolving these contradictions. Third, after completing the democratic revolution and basically completing the socialist transformation, the new task is to build socialism at a high speed and develop our country's economy, culture, and science. "Let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is precisely the best policy for developing academic culture and literature and art proposed to adapt to this new situation and new requirements.

Now it is very clear that this policy is, on the one hand, the best policy for mobilizing the enthusiasm of all literary and artistic workers and giving full play to the role of various literary and artistic forms. Under this policy, all literary and artistic workers can give full play to their talents, and various art forms can give full play to their roles to serve the purpose of socialist construction together in all aspects. This is the best policy for developing socialist literature and art. On the other hand, this is also the best policy for fighting bourgeois ideas. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in "The Victory of Marxism-Leninism in China": "Our adoption of this policy is by no means implementing the bourgeois policy of 'liberalization,' but rather implementing the extremely firm class policy of the proletariat. Implementing this policy... is for the development of Marxism and the socialist ideology under its guidance... is for the convenience of the proletariat to defeat the bourgeoisie politically and ideologically and eliminate its influence, rather than allowing bourgeois ideas to run rampant." We are materialists, and we believe that as long as classes exist, as long as there is still the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, there will be all kinds of hostile ideological consciousness, and there will be bourgeois ideological weeds. For bourgeois ideological weeds, it is better to let them be released and then weed them out, and to train the masses' ability to identify them and train the fighting forces of Marxism in the struggle. Facts have proved that implementing the policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" does not weaken Marxism and proletarian socialist literature and art, but strengthens and develops Marxism, and strengthens and develops proletarian socialist literature and art.

Third, the principle of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. This was proposed with the Party's general line for socialist construction and with the soaring enthusiasm of the people's great leap forward. After the people have mastered their own destiny, an unprecedented heroic era has emerged. To express the new era, the new masses, and the new life, new creative principles and new creative methods must be adopted. The combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism was proposed to meet this need.

Regarding the issue of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, there have been some discussions

    更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的旗帜
    （在一个学习会上的发言）
    林默涵
    毛泽东同志是伟大的马克思主义思想家、理论家。他把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的实践相结合，不仅领导中国人民取得了革命的胜利，改变了我国的面貌，并且创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。无论在哲学方面、政治经济学方面、科学的社会主义学说方面，他都有重大的创造性的发展。在文学艺术方面，毛泽东同志也发展了马克思主义的文艺思想，使马克思主义文艺思想具有了完整的系统性，高度的科学性和强烈的战斗性。
    对于毛泽东文艺思想，不同阶级、不同立场的人采取了不同的态度。一种是拥护的，这是大多数。一种是反对的。还有一种是低估它的，这种人也不少。拥护的人当然是认识毛泽东文艺思想的意义的，但认识的程度也可以有所不同。反对的人对于毛泽东文艺思想怀着刻骨的仇恨，他们为什么那样憎恨它呢？这是因为他们从阶级本能上感觉到毛泽东文艺思想是一个十分锐利的武器，它对资产阶级思想、资产阶级世界观是十分不利的。因此，他们千方百计地想要取消毛泽东文艺思想。他们简直恨透了它。胡风分子咒骂《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是“图腾”，说“它能屠杀生灵”。但他们知道公开反对是很难的，所以采取两种方法，一种是像胡风那样，教他的党徒们采取表面上顺着它而实质上反对它的办法。另外一些人则拼命地想办法来修正它，使毛泽东文艺思想符合于他们的资产阶级观点。右派分子徐懋庸、秦兆阳等人就是这样做的。徐懋庸在纪念《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》（以下简称《讲话》）发表十五周年的时候，写了一篇《过了时的纪念》，就是典型地修正毛泽东文艺思想的文章。徐懋庸竟然在纪念《讲话》的文章中公然宣传人性论，宣传对人民自己也要暴露，也要讽刺。《关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料》中，有一则按语讲得很好，按语说：有些人“抱着资产阶级的文艺观点，所以不能认识这个讲话的重要性。但是，张中晓这个胡风分子，凭着他的反革命的敏感，却深深地了解这个讲话在全国解放以后会在更广大的范围内掌握群众，并对各种反动的文艺思想起摧毁性的作用，所以他们就急于想阻止和破坏这个讲话的影响的扩大”。这段按语把为什么有些人那样反对或企图修正毛泽东文艺思想的道理讲得很清楚了。
    事实证明，毛泽东文艺思想使我们的文学艺术出现了一个完全新的面貌。解放以后的十年来，我们的文艺工作所以取得这样大的成绩，就是由于我们执行了党和毛泽东同志所制定的文艺方针，保卫了毛泽东文艺思想，就是由于毛泽东文艺思想越来越广泛地掌握了群众，首先是在文艺工作者当中大多数人接受了毛主席的文艺思想。这是我们取得胜利的最根本的原因。
    毛泽东同志怎样发展了马克思主义文艺思想呢？对这个问题，我没有做深入的研究，只能说一点自己在学习中的感觉和体会。如果有错误，请同志们批评指正。
    要说明毛泽东同志怎样发展了马克思主义文艺思想，就不能不先对马克思、恩格斯、列宁的文艺思想做一个最粗略的叙述。这方面我读的东西很少，不但不可能说得很完全，还可能有理解错的地方。
    马克思、恩格斯所处的时代是一个工人阶级已经登上历史舞台，但是无产阶级革命还没有成熟的时代。巴黎公社表现了无产阶级冲天的革命精神，但是很快就失败了。用列宁的说法，这是“资产阶级民主派的革命性已经衰亡，而无产阶级社会主义的革命性尚未成熟”的时候。这个时候，还没有出现什么真正的无产阶级作家。同马克思、恩格斯同一时期活动的，得到马克思、恩格斯的好评或者和他们有直接来往的，大概是这样一些作家：一种是巴尔扎克这样的作家。巴尔扎克的文学活动比马克思的活动早，但在1850年巴尔扎克逝世以前，马克思已经开始他的革命活动和著作活动了。马克思、恩格斯称赞过巴尔扎克，因为巴尔扎克深刻地揭露了资本主义社会的实质，揭露了资本主义社会中金钱支配一切的规律。巴尔扎克用形象、用活生生的人物和事件揭露了马克思、恩格斯在《共产党宣言》中用科学的语言所揭露的资本主义社会的残酷现象。但我们知道，巴尔扎克不是无产阶级作家，他是站在惋惜贵族灭亡的立场上来揭露资本主义社会的残酷和丑恶，又证明贵族社会灭亡和资本主义社会产生的必然性的。第二类作家，可以说是革命民主主义者或者是带有社会主义幻想的民主派作家，如海涅、乔治·桑等人，马克思和海涅有很好的感情，也很推崇乔治·桑，马克思喜欢他们是因为他们同情劳苦人民，他们对社会上的不平现象表示抗议。当然，他们也不是无产阶级作家，像海涅就是不理解真正的共产主义的。第三类作家的时代比较晚一些，主要是和恩格斯交往的。如明娜·考茨基（考茨基的母亲）、哈克纳斯等人，她们自称为社会主义者，实际上是一些小资产阶级的社会主义者，她们同情工人，但并不真正认识工人、了解工人。由于马克思、恩格斯他们所处的时代，由于当时还没有什么真正的无产阶级作家，同时还由于那时的文学作品“主要地是供给资产阶级圈子的读者”（恩格斯）看的，所以，马克思、恩格斯那时只能提出下面的一些主张和要求。
    第一，他们要求文学作品“真实地描写现实的关系，打破对于这些关系的性质的传统的幻想，粉碎资产阶级世界的乐观主义，引起对于现存秩序的永久性的怀疑”，如果能够这样，这就是一部有益的作品，这部小说就算是“完成了自己的使命”了（恩格斯）。当时他们对大多数作者只能提出这样的要求。同这种观点相联系，马克思对于当时德国的一些所谓“真正社会主义者”的诗歌是非常反感的，因为那些所谓“真正社会主义者”，其实是一些小资产阶级作家，他们的诗歌，实际上是在粉饰资本主义制度，巩固资本主义制度。
    第二，他们要求作家反映工人阶级的生活。恩格斯提出，“工人阶级对于压迫他们的环境的革命的反抗，他们想恢复自己的人的地位的紧张的企图……可以在现实主义的领域中要求一个地位”，因为工人阶级反抗压迫、争取解放的斗争已经“属于历史的一部分”了，恩格斯认为他们的斗争应当在现实主义的文学中有所表现。
    第三，他们进一步要求文学作品不但要反映工人阶级的生活和斗争，而且应该正确地表现工人阶级，不应该把工人阶级描写成消极的群众，不但不能自己救自己，甚至也不企图自己救自己。认为解放工人阶级是工人阶级本身的事业，既不靠什么神仙上帝，也不靠什么英雄豪杰：这是马克思主义的基本原则，是和一切空想的社会主义者、小资产阶级社会主义者的主要区别之一。空想社会主义者同情工人阶级，却不相信工人阶级能够自己解放自己，他们是想从外面或者从上面来解放工人阶级。恩格斯不满意哈克纳斯的作品，就是因为她把经历了几十年斗争锻炼的工人阶级描写成完全是消极的群众。恩格斯认为，尽管还有许多落后的工人，但从整个的时代环境来说，这种描写就是不典型的了。
    马克思、恩格斯在文学艺术方面发表了很多宝贵意见，直到今天仍然值得我们反复研究和学习，他们对未来的无产阶级文学表示了热烈的期望，这对后人也是极大的鼓舞。可是在马克思、恩格斯的时代，还不可能提出“无产阶级文学”的口号，更不可能明确地提出文学的党性的原则。这只有到了列宁的时候才有可能。列宁的有名的《党的组织和党的文学》一文，奠定了无产阶级文学的思想基础，第一次鲜明地提出了无产阶级文学的口号，提出了文学的党性的原则。
    《党的组织和党的文学》这篇文章是在俄国1905年第一次革命以后写的。同马克思、恩格斯所处的时代相比，这个时候，世界无产阶级革命运动已经大大向前发展了。1905年革命是俄国工人阶级对沙皇专制制度的第一个严重的打击。虽然革命没有胜利，但当时俄国的情况正如列宁所说的，是革命固然还没有力量战胜沙皇制度，而沙皇制度也已经没有力量战胜革命了。这篇文章一开头就说：“十月革命（指1905年十月的全俄政治罢工——引者）以后在俄国造成的社会民主党工作的新条件，使党的文学问题提到日程上来了。”这所谓“新条件”，除了工人运动的高涨以外，还由于沙皇政府不得不作出一些让步，对人民实行改良，给了人民一些出版、结社的自由。过去“存在着非法报刊和合法报刊的区别”，“一切非法的报刊都是党的报刊”，现在，党的报刊已经可以合法出版了，因此列宁指出，文学必须有鲜明的党性，才不致于同那些含含糊糊的、不彻底的东西相混淆。
    就在这样的条件下，列宁第一个提出了文学应当成为党的文学。列宁说：“这个党的文学的原则是什么呢？这不只是说，对于社会主义无产阶级，文学事业不能是个人或集团的赚钱工具，而且根本不能是与无产阶级总的事业无关的个人事业。……文学事业应当成为无产阶级总的事业的一部分，……应当成为有组织的、有计划的、统一的社会民主党的工作的一个组成部分。”因此，文学事业必须接受党的监督。列宁在这篇文章里很好地驳斥了资产阶级所谓“创作自由”的论调。他说，第一，资产阶级作家、艺术家不可能离开资产阶级出版家而自由，不可能摆脱对于钱袋的依赖，对于收买的依赖，对于豢养的依赖，他们所说的“创作自由”不过是一种欺骗。其次，作家有写他愿意写的任何东西的自由，但是党也有“赶走利用党的招牌来鼓吹反党观点的人”的自由；你有言论自由，党有结社自由，有保护党的纯洁性的自由。同时，列宁说明了只有无产阶级文学才是真正自由的文学，因为它是有觉悟的分子自愿为劳动人民服务而创作的文学，是为千百万人民服务的文学；是摆脱了资产阶级个人主义束缚的文学。列宁还指出，主张党的文学，决不应该抹煞个人的创造性；决不能把无产阶级党的事业的文学部分同无产阶级党的事业的其他部分刻板地等同起来。
    列宁的另一个重要思想，就是他在同德国女革命家蔡特金的谈话中，明确地指出：文学艺术是属于人民的，它必须为千百万劳动人民服务，必须为他们所了解和爱好。他说：“难道当工农大众还缺少黑面包的时候，我们要把精制的甜饼干送给少数人吗？”他认为，一定要把文学艺术送到群众中去，并且要把最好的艺术送到群众中去，“我们的工人和农民，理应享受比马戏更好的东西。他们有权利享受真正伟大的艺术。”
    还有，大家知道，列宁提出了关于两种文化的学说。列宁指出，“每一个民族文化中，都有两种民族文化。”一种是“俄罗斯神甫的和资产阶级的文化”，一种是“大俄罗斯的民主派和社会民主派的文化”。他同时指出，无产阶级必须吸收和改造人类思想和文化发展中一切有价值的东西。
    无产阶级的文学艺术，必须是党的文学艺术，必须为工农群众服务，同时，要正确地对待文化遗产。这就是列宁文艺思想的主要内容。很明显，到了列宁，已经明确地建立起无产阶级文学艺术的党性和群众性的思想了。伟大的苏联文学，社会主义现实主义的文学，正是列宁早年的主张和要求的一个合乎规律的发展。
    毛泽东文艺思想创造性地发展了列宁的文艺思想，这集中地表现在毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中。《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是在这样一种情况下产生的。一方面，全世界反法西斯战争和全国人民的抗日战争，正在进入艰苦的相持阶段。另一方面，党所领导的革命力量空前壮大，工人阶级不但有了自己的武装，而且有了自己的根据地。大批作家艺术家到了根据地，出现在他们面前的是新的群众、是新的“描写对象和作品接受者”。作家艺术家们是去表现新的群众、新的思想、新的感情，为新的群众服务呢？还是继续表现他们所喜爱的旧人物、旧思想、旧感情，投合旧的读者呢？这就是当时摆在作家艺术家面前的问题。许多作家艺术家没有解决这个问题。他们仍然抱着旧的世界观、旧的思想感情来对待群众，对待文学艺术事业，这样他们就不能不同新的环境、新的群众和对于文艺的新的要求，发生尖锐的矛盾了。这个问题不解决，文学艺术就不能正确地向前发展，就不但不能为革命服务，反而可能损害革命。延安文艺座谈会就是在这样的情况下，为了解决这个矛盾而召开的。
    列宁提出了文学艺术必须是党的事业的一部分，必须为工农大众服务。但是，如何才能真正成为党的文学艺术，如何才能真正做到为工农大众服务，列宁却没有来得及加以详细的阐明。彻底地解决这些问题，是毛泽东同志的伟大贡献。毛泽东同志的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是一部最完整的马克思主义文艺思想的科学文献，它给无产阶级社会主义文学艺术的发展指出了最明确的道路，创造性地解决了马克思主义文艺思想的一系列根本问题。
    毛泽东文艺思想是这样地丰富，我们每一次重读毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和他的有关文艺的其他论述，都能得到新的启发，新的教育。因此，要在这个发言中说明他的全部思想是不可能的。我想，可不可以说，最主要的是解决了下面几个最根本的问题。
    第一，毛泽东同志彻底解决了文艺和革命的关系问题。《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》一开始就说，开座谈会，目的就是“研究文艺工作和一般革命工作的关系，求得革命文艺对其他革命工作的更好的协助，借以打倒我们民族的敌人，完成民族解放的任务。”在这一点上，毛泽东同志发挥了列宁的思想，认为文艺应该“很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”“文艺是从属于政治的，但又反转来给予伟大的影响于政治。”文艺工作和党的整个工作的关系是：革命文艺是整个革命事业的一部分，是整个机器的齿轮和螺丝钉，它应该服从于革命的任务。这是最根本的原则。我们同资产阶级文艺家的最主要的分歧，就是他们总是有意或无意地用“为艺术而艺术”的招牌来掩盖他们的政治目的，我们则公开地主张为革命而艺术。既然文学是党的整个革命事业的一部分，它就当然必须接受党的领导和监督。否认文艺事业是整个革命事业的一部分，就必然会拒绝党对文艺的领导，就会像王实味一样，认为不是政治领导艺术，而是艺术领导政治，或者像南斯拉夫修正主义者一样，认为“艺术和国家之间”存在着什么“对抗性的矛盾”。
    毛泽东同志又指出，文学艺术是整个革命事业的一部分，但它是不可缺少的一部分，是对于整个机器不可缺少的齿轮和螺丝钉。“如果连最广义最普通的文学艺术也没有，那革命运动就不能进行，就不能胜利。”这就是说，文艺不是可有可无的一个部分，而是对革命事业，对全部机器起推动作用的、积极的一部分。正因为这样，党中央和毛泽东同志从来就是非常重视文艺工作的，这不是由于个人的爱好，而是因为文艺对广大群众有极大的影响，对革命事业有很大的作用；如果它是正确的，就可以起好的作用，如果走了错路，就可以起坏作用。正因为如此，毛泽东同志提出了衡量文艺作品必须以政治标准为第一，他说，“文艺批评有两个标准，一个是政治标准，一个是艺术标准”，这二者的关系是“以政治标准放在第一位，以艺术标准放在第二位”。政治标准第一，就是说对于文艺作品首先要看它对革命事业有利还是不利。如果你承认文艺是为革命服务的，就必然会承认政治第一的批评标准。否认政治第一的批评标准，实质上就是否认文艺要为革命服务。
    第二，毛泽东同志解决了文艺和群众的关系问题。在这个问题上，毛泽东同志也发展了列宁的思想。正如列宁所说的，过去的文学是“作家写，读者读”，旧时代的作家既不考虑要不要表现工农群众的问题，也不考虑自己的作品是不是为工农群众所接受的问题。但是，无产阶级文学就不能不考虑这个新的问题了，这就是毛泽东同志说的，你的“描写对象和作品接受者”都不同了。毛泽东同志明确地解决了文艺为工农兵服务和如何为工农兵服务的问题，这是最重要的问题，也是他的讲话的主要部分。
    文艺为工农兵服务，主要的有这样一些方面：就是作家要站在无产阶级的立场上观察事物，描写事物；就是要努力去表现工农兵；就是要加强工农兵的同心同德，而不是使他们离心离德；就是要引导人们接近工农兵，而不是离开工农兵。如何为工农兵服务，就是通过普及和提高的正确结合来达到服务的目的。毛泽东同志辩证地规定了普及和提高之间的正确关系：在普及基础上的提高，在提高指导下的普及。普及也好，提高也好，都是为了给工农兵大众服务。既为工农兵今天的需要服务，又为他们明天的需要服务。片面地强调提高忽视普及是错误的，是脱离群众的，只注意普及而忽视提高也是不应该的。正如毛泽东同志所指出，“一部分优秀的作品现在也有普及的可能”，而同时，“广大群众的文化水平也是在不断地提高着……人民要求普及，跟着也就要求提高，要求逐年逐月地提高”。同时，毛泽东同志又指出，要为广大群众服务，也要为群众中的干部服务，他们虽然是少数人，但他们是群众的干部，是群众中的先进分子，“为干部，也完全是为群众，因为只有经过干部才能去教育群众、指导群众”，所以，这种“干部所需要的提高”就是“间接为群众所需要的提高”，“忽视这一点是错误的”。
    在解决普及与提高关系的同时，毛泽东同志也解决了专门家与普及工作者以及专业创作与群众业余创作的关系。毛泽东同志指出，“我们应该尊重专门家，专门家对于我们的事业是很可宝贵的。”但是专门家应该联系群众，注意群众的墙报、通讯文学、群众歌唱、群众美术，“一方面帮助他们，指导他们，一方面又向他们学习”。如果把自己看作“高踞于‘下等人’头上的贵族，那末，不管他们有多大的才能，也是群众所不需要的，他们的工作是没有前途的”。
    毛泽东同志的这一系列的规定，正确地解决了为工农兵服务的方向、办法和道路。
    第三，毛泽东同志解决了艺术和生活的关系问题。毛泽东同志根据辩证唯物主义思想很好地解决了艺术和生活的关系问题。首先，人类的社会生活是文学艺术的唯一的源泉，一切文学艺术作品都是生活的反映，“只能有这样的源泉，此外不能有第二个源泉”。所以，文学艺术决不能够离开生活，从古人的作品和外国人的作品去“硬搬和模仿”。其次，“作为观念形态的文艺作品，都是一定的社会生活在人类头脑中的反映的产物”，而生活通过人们的头脑反映出来，不可能不受他的世界观和思想立场的影响。每一个人的头脑里都反映生活，但是并不是人人都能正确地反映生活，只有具有正确的世界观和正确的思想立场的人，才能够正确地反映生活。所以，毛泽东同志说，“革命的文艺，则是人民生活在革命作家头脑中的反映的产物”。同样的人民生活，在反动的作家的头脑中反映出来，就不会是革命的文艺，而是反革命的文艺。再其次，既然文艺作品是人民生活在作家头脑中的反映的产物，那就是说，必然要经过作家的分析、选择、判断和概括。因此“文艺作品中反映出来的生活却可以而且应该比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性”。这种反映不可能是纯客观的，而是经过作家的选择、分析和判断的。因此，反过来，文学艺术又能够对生活起推动、促进的作用。生活是文艺的源泉，文艺从生活中来，同时文艺又比生活更高，因此能够反过来影响生活、促进生活。这就是毛泽东同志对于文艺和生活的关系的基本看法。
    第四，毛泽东同志很好地解决了作家和群众的关系问题。要解决文艺为革命服务，为工农兵服务的问题，要正确地反映人民的生活，最根本的关键，就是文艺工作者必须同群众结合，在同群众结合中改造思想，同时又取得创作的源泉。这是毛泽东文艺思想中的一个重要的观点。毛泽东同志指出，作家艺术家只要下定决心，通过学习马克思主义理论，并且长期深入革命斗争，同群众打成一片，理论与实际反复结合，就能收到改造旧思想，建立无产阶级世界观的效果。毛泽东同志指出了作家艺术家联系群众、改造思想的光明道路，这是一项极重大的贡献。关于这一点，我国很多作家都有深切的体会。既然无产阶级文学艺术是一种完全新的文学艺术，它的思想观点，它的描写对象，它的服务对象，都同旧时代的文学艺术不同，作家、艺术家就不能按照旧时代作家、艺术家的老路子走了。只有解决了这个问题，才可能有真正的社会主义的文学艺术。
    第五，毛泽东同志解决了文艺与民族文化传统的关系问题。无产阶级文艺不是从天上掉下来的，它必须在旧有的传统的基地上建立起来。毛泽东同志发展了列宁的“两种民族文化”的学说，首先要我们对自己民族的文化传统进行科学的分析。在文化遗产中既有民主性革命性的东西，又有封建性反动性的东西，我们应该“剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华”。对于传统，应该根据历史唯物主义的观点加以研究，给它以应有的历史地位。既反对割断历史，不要传统，又反对颂古非今，拜倒在传统面前。毛泽东同志指出我们批判地继承传统的目的，是为了推进中国的新文化；是为了革新和创造，而不是因袭守旧，让传统来拖住我们前进的脚步；是引导人们向前看，而不是向后看。毛泽东同志用“推陈出新”这一句话，最概括、最生动地表现了批判、继承和革新、创造的辩证的关系。
    毛泽东同志要我们批判地学习和吸收外国的一切有用的东西，但是学习了外国的东西，必须使它同我们民族的东西相溶合，使它具有民族色彩。文学艺术和某些技术科学不同，技术科学的对象是自然规律，而文学艺术是表现人民的生活、思想和感情的，它就不可能不带民族的特色。我们的文艺必须具有自己民族的特点、民族的风格，要“标新立异”：标民族之新，立民族之异。这样才能为人民所喜爱，又为世界文化作出了我们民族的独特贡献。
    总之一句话，从古人学习是为了现在的活人，从外国人学习是为了今天的中国人。一切盲目崇拜外国、盲目崇拜古人的思想都是极其有害的。
    上面所说的几点，我认为是文学艺术上面最根本的问题，这些根本的问题，毛泽东同志都极其正确地、全面地、系统地、辩证地加以解决了。
    全国解放以后，十年来，在新的形势和条件下，毛泽东同志又继续创造性地发展了马克思主义的文艺思想。我认为最重要的是以下几个方面：
    第一，毛泽东同志非常重视文学艺术战线上的两条道路的斗争。解放以后，文艺界在党中央和毛泽东同志领导下，进行了一系列的斗争。从《武训传》的批判开始，《红楼梦研究》批判、胡适思想批判、反胡风的斗争、反对丁陈反党集团的斗争、文艺界反右派斗争，以及反修正主义的斗争，根本问题是两种世界观的斗争，是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的斗争。毛泽东同志曾经指出我们许多同志根本不能辨别什么是革命的，什么是反动的，什么是新事物，什么是旧事物，什么应该歌颂，什么应该反对。全国解放刚一年多，毛泽东同志就注意到了思想领域内两条道路的斗争问题。但是，文艺界许多同志没有充分认识文艺界这一连串思想斗争的意义，没有认识到这是整个思想战线上的阶级斗争的一部分，是文艺思想上谁战胜谁的斗争，是要无产阶级文艺还是要资产阶级文艺的斗争，是用什么思想去培养文艺队伍的斗争。只有经过这样一系列的斗争，才能够建立起无产阶级的文学艺术，才能够解放文艺界的生产力。正如周扬同志在《文艺战线上的一场大辩论》中说的：这些斗争，“给资产阶级反动思想以致命的打击，解放文学艺术界及其后备军的生产力，解除旧社会给他们带上的脚镣手铐，免除反动空气的威胁，替无产阶级文学艺术开辟了一条广泛发展的道路。”这个分析是十分正确，完全切合实际的。我们回想一下，在没有进行这些斗争以前，文艺界是一种什么情况。那时一些党员作家可以公开宣扬资产阶级个人主义，可以公开反对党的领导。不少作家、艺术家不是力求同党靠拢，同人民结合，而是日益同党疏远，同群众隔离。一些青年作家一出来很快就受到资产阶级思想的腐蚀，不少人在胡风、丁玲的影响下堕落下去了。而有些同志，对这一连串斗争实际上是采取了旁观的态度，他们对敌对的东西没有无产阶级应有的愤怒，对于胡风猖狂攻击党、攻击社会主义竟可以袖手旁观。他们自称老党员，是毛主席的拥护者，但眼看毛泽东文艺思想受到攻击诽谤却不起来斗争。他们根本忘记了自己是共产党员，应该起来保卫党的路线，保卫毛泽东文艺思想。也有另一些同志，他们参加过这些斗争，但不能充分估计这些斗争的意义，没有看到文学艺术工作的成就是同这些斗争分不开的，不经过这些斗争，文学艺术的生产力是得不到解放的。所以，有一些文章，在谈到十年来文艺工作成就的时候，对思想斗争的意义轻描淡写，略表几句，相反倒强调地反对思想斗争中的或读者讨论中的简单化和庸俗社会学的个别现象。我们不否认在思想斗争中特别是青年读者的批评意见中有过简单化和庸俗社会学的缺点，但是这不是主要方面，并且也是群众性的批评中一时不可避免的。可是按照这类文章的看法，今天的任务不是继续开展思想斗争反对修正主义，而是主要反对庸俗社会学。这是完全错误的。《文学知识》编辑部的《欢呼新中国文学的重大成就和发展》（见该刊1959年10月号）就是一篇典型的文章。这篇文章整个说来是歌颂新中国文学的成就的，但却根本忘记了我们的社会还有阶级矛盾，忘记在文艺界还有敌对思想存在，忘记了还要长期进行思想斗争，这是很危险的，这往往就是修正主义的根源，是极有害的。毛泽东同志在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》里说：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。这是因为资产阶级和从旧社会来的知识分子的影响还要在我国长期存在，作为阶级的意识形态，还要在我国长期存在。如果对于这种形势认识不足，或者根本不认识，那就要犯绝大的错误，就会忽视必要的思想斗争。”解放十年来，正是在党中央和毛泽东同志领导下，进行了文艺战线上两条道路、两种世界观的斗争。经过这样的斗争，马克思主义的领导地位，已经在文艺界基本上树立起来了。
    第二，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”。这是在新的形势新的条件下发展学术文化和文学艺术的马克思主义的方针，是无产阶级极端坚定的阶级政策。我们党在1956年提出这个方针，是由于：第一，经济上的社会主义改造已经基本上完成了，同时，经过了一连串的思想斗争，马克思主义在思想界已经树立了领导地位。第二，在人民内部还有资产阶级思想存在，还有意识形态上的阶级矛盾和其他各种不同的思想。对这些不同的思想，只有采取“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针让它们发表出来，经过自由批评，自由讨论，用说服而不是用压服的办法，才更有利于解决这些矛盾。第三，在完成了民主革命和基本上完成了社会主义改造以后，新的任务就是高速度地建设社会主义，发展我国的经济、文化和科学，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”正是为了适应这个新的形势和新的要求而提出来的发展学术文化和文学艺术的最好的方针。
    现在看得很清楚，这个方针，一方面是调动一切文艺工作者的积极性、发挥各种文艺样式的作用的最好的方针，在这个方针下，各个文艺工作者都可以施展他们的才能，各种艺术形式都能充分发挥它们的作用，从各个方面共同为社会主义建设的目的服务。这是发展社会主义文艺的最好的方针。另一方面，这又是同资产阶级思想斗争的最好的方针。正如刘少奇同志在《马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利》一文中所说的：“我们采取这个方针，绝不是实行资产阶级的‘自由化’政策。而是实行无产阶级的极端坚定的阶级政策。实行这个方针……是为着发展马克思主义及其指导下的社会主义的意识形态。……是为着便利无产阶级在政治上和思想上战胜资产阶级，肃清它的影响，而不是容许资产阶级思想自由泛滥。”我们是唯物主义者，我们认为只要阶级存在，只要还有资产阶级的思想影响，就会有各种各样的敌对思想意识，就会有资产阶级思想毒草。对于资产阶级思想毒草，与其压下去不准出来，不如让它们放出来然后锄掉，在斗争中锻炼群众的识别能力，锻炼马克思主义的战斗力量。事实证明，实行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针，并不是削弱马克思主义、削弱无产阶级社会主义的文学艺术，而是锻炼和发展了马克思主义，锻炼和发展了无产阶级的社会主义文学艺术。
    第三，革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作原则。这是随着党的社会主义建设总路线，随着人民大跃进的冲天干劲而提出的。在人民掌握了自己的命运以后，已经出现了一个空前未有的英雄时代。要表现新的时代，新的群众，新的生活，就不能不采取新的创作原则，新的创作方法。革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合，就是适应这种需要而提出来的。
    关于革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的问题，文艺界进行过一些讨论，周扬同志在《新民歌开拓了诗歌的新道路》（载《红旗》1958年第1期）一文中，阐述了这个创作原则的根本要求，我完全同意他的意见。我现在想就这个问题，特别是对革命浪漫主义的理解问题，说一说自己的不成熟的看法。
    我以为，革命浪漫主义有两个方面，一方面是浪漫主义精神，一方面是浪漫主义手法。这两者常常是相联系的，但又不一定非联系起来不可。有浪漫主义精神的作品可以用浪漫主义手法来表现，也可以不用浪漫主义手法来表现，比如鲁迅的一些作品，就是属于后者。
    最主要的是要掌握浪漫主义精神。我认为革命浪漫主义精神就是要看到生活里的新事物，要善于反映新事物，帮助新事物的成长。在今天来说，就是要善于看到生活中的共产主义新因素。列宁、毛泽东所以是伟大的革命家，是革命浪漫主义者，就因为他们始终能够看到人民生活中的积极的新生的东西，无论在怎样困难的环境中，他们总是对革命、对胜利充满了信心。列宁的《卡·马克思致路·库格曼书信集俄译本序言》中有好几段话可以作为革命浪漫主义的最好的说明。他说：要“学习那种决不因革命暂时遭到挫折而灰心丧气的坚忍不拔的精神。”“谁把冷静地肯定客观情况的理论曲解为替现状辩护，以至于尽快地使自己去应付每次革命的暂时低潮，尽快地抛弃‘革命幻想’而去从事‘现实主义的’小事情，那他就不是马克思主义者。”这就是说，要冷静地观察和分析客观现实，但不能因此而为现状辩护，不去看到可以改变现状的革命的、新生的事物。列宁接着说：“马克思就是在那些仿佛最平静的、如他所形容的‘富有田园风味的’时期，或如《新时代》杂志编者所说的‘极沉闷的’时期，也能够觉察到革命将临的气息，而使无产阶级觉悟到他们所负的先进的革命任务。”列宁在这里提倡了革命运动中的革命浪漫主义，反对那种为现状辩护的没有理想、没有远见的“现实主义”。毛泽东同志在第一次国内革命战争失败之后提出“星星之火，可以燎原”，这也是最高的革命浪漫主义精神。有的人根本看不到星星之火，认为革命已经失败了，没有希望了。还有的人看到了星星之火，却不相信它可以燎原。革命浪漫主义的精神，就是既能看到星星之火，又坚定地相信它可以燎原，并且积极地促进它的燎原。因此，我认为革命浪漫主义的精神所要表现的理想，不能是脱离现实的，它是从现实中来的，它是现实生活发展的必然趋势。作者首先从现实中看到了理想，否则，他的理想就是空洞的幻想。因此，我认为，革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合是一个完整的、不可分割的创作原则，而不是像有些人所理解的那样，外加点“理想”，外加点“浪漫主义”。正因为这样，这种理想才是有力量的，是有现实基础的，它才能鼓舞作者去热爱它，描写它，热情地促进它的成长和胜利。　（明日续完）
