　　The Story of Sewage Fertilizing Fields
　　Shao Youzhi
　　When the Shaodong Coal Oil Refinery was first established, because everyone lacked experience, they casually discharged the sewage from tar refining into the small river. This discharge had serious consequences. Before long, the river was covered with bloated dead fish and shrimp. It turned out that the sewage was toxic, and the fish died after eating it. When the workers at the oil refinery heard this feedback, they quickly built a large pool to store the sewage. However, production continued, and the sewage kept increasing, quickly filling the pool to the brim. How many more pools would they have to build in the long run? The urgent situation forced people to use their brains. Inspired by the Party branch, the workers planted several poplar trees by the pool and used sewage to irrigate them to see if it would benefit plant growth. Before long, these saplings grew lush and were taller than the trees that had not been irrigated with sewage along the road. This really made the workers happy, and they were sure that the sewage had a fertilizing effect.

　　Later, considering that sewage could poison fish and shrimp, it might also have insecticidal effects. They began new experiments. Everyone enthusiastically captured many rice borers, locusts, termites, and other pests and soaked them in sewage. The results proved that it had a strong killing power. In this way, they were confident that the sewage could both fertilize the fields and kill insects.

　　Just then, the rice fields in the Huochangping Commune near the factory were suffering from widespread pest infestation, and the supply of "666" pesticide powder could not meet the demand in time. They introduced "sewage," this new insecticide, to the commune. The Wulong Brigade of the commune first conducted experiments in the fields. Three days after the sewage was poured into the fields, the rice seedlings turned from yellow to green, and the pest infestation was greatly reduced. Then, the entire brigade promoted sewage for insect control and fertilization.

　　The pestilence was stopped, but what about the fertilizing effect? The autumn harvest provided the most powerful proof. The more than six hundred mu of rice fields in Wulong Brigade and Shuangquan Team that had been treated with sewage yielded an average of 510 jin per mu for early rice, 680 jin per mu for mid-season rice, and high yields for late rice and japonica rice as well. The pumpkins and sweet potatoes watered with sewage were also larger than those without sewage.

　　The news that sewage could fertilize fields and kill insects spread like wildfire. Now, many commune members go to the Shaodong Oil Refinery every day to carry sewage to fertilize their fields. They sing: "The sewage from the oil refinery is truly good, it can kill insects and fertilize the fields, use sewage to soak the fields, and the yields are high and the melons are big."

    污水肥田的故事
    邵尤之
    邵东煤炼油厂刚刚建立起来的时候，由于大家都没有经验，把提炼焦油以后的污水随便往小河里放。这一放非同小可，没有多久，小河里就浮起了一团团翻着肚子的鱼虾。原来这些污水是有毒性的，鱼吃了就死。炼油厂的工人们听到了这个反映，连忙修了一个大池子来储存污水。可是，生产在不断地进行，污水也在不断地增加，很快就把一个池塘灌得满满的。长此下去得修多少个池子呢？事急，逼着人们开动脑筋。职工们在党支部的启发下，在池子边栽了几棵白杨树，用污水浇灌，看它是不是有利植物生长。没有多久，这些小树就枝叶茂盛地生长起来，而且比路边没有用污水浇灌的树高出一头。这件事可真把工人们乐坏了，他们肯定了污水是有肥效的。
    后来，又考虑到污水能毒死鱼虾，可能还有杀虫效力。他们又开始了新的试验，大伙兴致勃勃地去捕捉了好多螟虫、蝗虫、白蚁等害虫用污水浇浸，结果证明杀伤力很强。这样，他们就定下心来，肯定污水既可肥田，又能杀虫。
    正巧这时工厂附近的火厂坪公社秧田普遍发生虫害，一时“六六六”药粉供应不上，他们就把“污水”这个新的杀虫剂介绍给公社了。公社乌龙大队首先在田里进行了试验，污水灌进田三天以后，禾苗就由黄转青，虫害大大地减少了。接着全大队就推广了污水杀虫、肥田。
    虫灾制止了，肥效究竟如何呢？秋收作出了最有力的证明。乌龙大队和双泉中队施过污水的六百多亩稻子，早稻平均每亩产五百一十斤，中稻每亩产六百八十斤，晚稻和粳稻的产量也很高。用污水浇过的南瓜、地瓜，也比没有施污水的结得大。
    污水能肥田杀虫的消息像一阵风传开了。现在，每天都有不少公社社员去邵东油厂挑污水肥田。他们唱道：“石油厂的污水真不差，杀虫肥田都要它，使用污水把田浸，产量高来瓜也大。”
