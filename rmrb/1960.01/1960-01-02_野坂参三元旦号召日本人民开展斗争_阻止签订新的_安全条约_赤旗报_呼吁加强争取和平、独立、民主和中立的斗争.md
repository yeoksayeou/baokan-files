Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 1st: Nosaka Sanzō, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, published an article in "Akahata" today, calling on the Japanese people to strive to make 1960 a meaningful year for the Japanese people to launch struggles and achieve victories.

Nosaka said that the voices and actions of people from all countries around the world demanding peaceful coexistence and disarmament are rapidly rising, and Japan is, of course, no exception. This change in the international situation has created favorable conditions for our future struggles.

Nosaka pointed out that, however, there are still stubborn, bellicose reactionary forces in the world plotting to intensify international tensions with various conspiracies. The attempt by US imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke clique to forcibly revise the Japan-US "Security Treaty" despite the opposition of the Japanese people is an important part of their conspiracy.

Nosaka called on all Japanese people to join the Japanese Communist Party in launching struggles from the beginning of the year to prevent Kishi Nobusuke from going to the United States to sign a new "Security Treaty," and to further strive together to abolish the "Security Treaty." Furthermore, in order to make 1960 a year of struggle and victory, efforts should be made to establish a new Japan of peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 1st: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," published an editorial today entitled "Turn 1960 into a Great Year for the Japanese People," calling on the Japanese people to strengthen the struggle for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality.

The editorial pointed out that the central task of the Japanese people's current struggle is to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the Japan-US "Security Treaty." The US-Japan reactionaries are attempting to turn Japan into a base for preventing the world from moving towards peace and undermining humanity's struggle for lasting peace by revising the "Security Treaty." However, the current historical conditions show that as long as the Japanese people raise their awareness, stand with the people of the world, and actively launch struggles, the conspiracies of the US-Japan reactionaries will not succeed. Because from an international perspective, the Japanese people are currently in a very advantageous position. Conversely, the future of the US-Japan reactionaries is becoming increasingly dark; the Japanese reactionaries, who are subservient to the United States and eager to revive imperialism and militarism, are filled with contradictions in their international position, their strength is becoming weaker and weaker; and their domestic isolation is also deepening. Therefore, the neutralization of Japan is an inevitable trend.

"Akahata" said that the above words are the New Year's greetings from the Japanese Communist Party to all Japanese people who demand peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality.

    野坂参三元旦号召日本人民开展斗争
    阻止签订新的“安全条约”
    “赤旗报”呼吁加强争取和平、独立、民主和中立的斗争
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本共产党主席野坂参三今天在“赤旗报”上发表文章，号召日本人民争取使1960年成为日本人民展开斗争与取得胜利的有意义的一年。
    野坂说，目前世界各国人民要求和平共处和裁军的声浪和行动正在迅速高涨起来，当然日本也不例外。这种国际形势的变化为我们今后的斗争创造了有利的条件。
    野坂指出，但是世界上仍然存在着顽强的好战反动势力，正在策划加剧国际紧张局势的种种阴谋。美帝国主义和岸信介集团不顾日本人民的反对企图强行修改日美“安全条约”，这是它们的阴谋的一个重要环节。
    野坂号召全体日本人民同日本共产党一起从年初起就开始展开斗争，阻止岸信介到美国签订新的“安全条约”，进一步为争取废除“安全条约”而共同奋斗。并且为了争取使1960年成为斗争与胜利的一年，为了争取建立和平、独立、民主、中立的新日本而努力。
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表题为“把1960年变成日本人民的伟大一年”的社论，号召日本人民加强争取和平、独立、民主和中立的斗争。
    社论指出，日本人民目前的中心斗争任务是阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”。美日反动派企图通过修改“安全条约”把日本变成阻止世界走向和平、破坏人类争取持久和平的斗争的据点。但是，现在的历史条件表明，只要日本人民提高觉悟，同世界人民站在一起积极展开斗争，美日反动派的阴谋是完全不会成功的。因为从国际上看，日本人民目前站在非常有利的地位。与此相反，美日反动派的前途是越来越黑暗；屈从美国急于复活帝国主义和军国主义的日本反动派，在国际上的地位充满着矛盾，力量越来越削弱；并且在国内的孤立倾向也加深了。因此，日本的中立化是不可避免的趋势。
    “赤旗报”说，上述几句话是日本共产党对要求和平、独立、民主、中立的日本所有人民的新年贺词。
