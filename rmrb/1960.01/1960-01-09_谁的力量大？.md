    Whose Power is Greater?
    Our people have completed 11.6 billion cubic meters of earthwork in this winter water conservancy project by the end of last year.
    In a year, all the rivers in the world complete a maximum of about 16 billion cubic meters of earthwork - the sediment carried into the sea.
    The raging waves can only damage 40 million cubic meters of coastline in a year.
    The Panama Canal, touted as the "grand spectacle of the universe" in the capitalist world, only involved the excavation of nearly 200 million cubic meters of earth during its construction, and it took thirty-three years to complete. If the downtime is not counted, the actual construction time was also eighteen years.

    谁的力量大？
    我国人民这次冬修水利到去年年底已完成一百一十六亿立方米的土方。
    在一年中，全世界所有河流完成的土方——搬运入海的泥沙，也不过最多一百六十亿立方米左右。
    汹涌的海浪在一年中所能破坏的海岸，仅仅四千万立方米。
    在资本主义世界中被吹嘘为“宇宙之大观”的巴拿马运河，开凿时所挖的土方只有将近两亿立方米，而先后经过了三十三年才完成，如果不算停工时间，实际开工时间也用了十八年。
