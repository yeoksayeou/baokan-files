Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 4th: The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council issued a statement today, expressing its full support for the struggle of the Central African people for the right to self-determination and to secede from the "Central African Federation."

The Secretariat emphasized in the statement that if the British colonial authorities do not clearly stipulate the right of the Central African people to secede from this federation, and at the same time do not release the African political leaders of Nyasaland and Rhodesia and allow them to participate in the upcoming Central African constitutional conference, then this conference will be futile.

The statement said that the Secretariat, recognizing that the same governmental system that subjects the people of South Africa to unjust treatment will be established in Rhodesia and Nyasaland, therefore expresses deep concern for the right to self-determination of the Central African people. The statement concluded by saying that the Afro-Asian people are determined to overthrow imperialism and racial rule. They will take all necessary steps to help the people of Nyasaland and Rhodesia achieve self-determination.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 4th: The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council today sent telegrams to Cameroonian Prime Minister Ahidjo and Cameroonian People's Union Chairman Moumié, congratulating Cameroon on its independence and expressing the hope that Cameroon will achieve complete independence. In the telegram to Ahidjo, the Secretariat stated that the path to Cameroon's complete independence should be through the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Cameroon and the establishment of genuine democracy in Cameroon. The telegram also said that banned political parties should be allowed to resume activities and that free elections should be held.

The Secretariat, on behalf of all Afro-Asian people, called on Ahidjo to immediately begin consultations with Cameroonian People's Union Chairman Moumié on the above basis.

In the telegram to Moumié, the Secretariat said that Cameroon's independence is the result of the struggle of the Cameroonian People's Union. The telegram said that the Afro-Asian people fully support the Cameroonian People's Union's desire for Cameroon's complete independence, democracy, and unification. (Attached picture)

    亚非人民团结理事会书记处声明
    支持中非人民争取自决的斗争
    主张一切外国军队立即撤出喀麦隆
    新华社开罗4日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天发表声明，表示充分支持中非人民争取自决和脱离“中非联邦”的权利的斗争。
    书记处在声明中强调指出，如果英国殖民当局不明确规定中非人民有脱离这个联邦的权利，同时不释放尼亚萨兰和罗得西亚的非洲人政治领袖并让他们参加将要举行的中非制宪会议的话，那么这个会议将是无益的。
    声明说，书记处由于认识到使南非人民遭受不公正待遇的那种政府制度，将在罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰建立，因此对中非人民的自决权利表示深为关切。声明最后说，亚非人民决心要推翻帝国主义和种族统治。他们将采取一切必要步骤来帮助尼亚萨兰和罗得西亚人民实现自决。
    据新华社开罗4日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天分别打电报给喀麦隆总理阿希乔和喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃，祝贺喀麦隆独立，并且表示希望喀麦隆将获得完全的独立。书记处在给阿希乔的电报中说，喀麦隆实现完全独立的道路应该通过使一切外国军队立即撤出喀麦隆和在喀麦隆建立真正的民主。电报还说，应该让那些被禁止的政党恢复活动，并且举行自由选举。
    书记处还以全体亚非人民的名义，呼吁阿希乔在上述基础上立即开始同喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃进行协商。
    书记处在给穆米埃的电报中说，喀麦隆的独立是喀麦隆人民联盟斗争的结果。电报说，亚非人民完全支持喀麦隆人民联盟争取喀麦隆的完全独立、民主和统一的愿望。（附图片）
