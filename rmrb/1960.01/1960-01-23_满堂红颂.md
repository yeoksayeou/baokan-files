	Ode to a Sea of Red
	Xiao San
	I stride forward on Chang'an Avenue,
	Opening my arms wide,
	To embrace the sun rising from the East,
	And welcome the sixties of the twentieth century.
	Sunlight bathes Tiananmen Square,
	Spreading over the vast and beautiful land,
	From Changbai and Kunlun to the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers…
	A red start, a sea of red, year after year, a radiant red glow!
	I feel Chairman Mao standing before me on the rostrum,
	Inspecting the twentieth "October 1st".
	In the square, a sea of people walks with rockets and spaceships,
	The Chairman with foresight surveys the future ten centuries.
	The masses rejoice, shouting "Long Live!" like roaring tides.
	Ten thousand red flags billow in the swift east wind.
	The targets completed in the past decade can be a source of pride.
	In the next decade, we will scale peak after peak.
	I cannot say for sure what will happen in ten years.
	Let me just offer two simple figures for contemplation:
	In ten or eight years, can we increase steel production by several tens of millions of tons?
	In ten or eight years, can we increase grain production by several hundred billion jin?
	Friends, you might say these ideas are devoid of poetry?
	Comrades, I ask you, have you lost your ambition?
	The proletariat and communists are most rich in imagination!
	Modern industry and modern agriculture... are they but extravagant hopes?
	In order to change the face of poverty and blankness—
	The Party and Chairman Mao have given us three magic weapons!!!
	Party, Chairman Mao, as long as you say the word,
	Six hundred million people will be filled with boundless energy!
	Party, Chairman Mao, as long as you set the plan,
	Six hundred million people will leap forward!
	Experience proves: where multi-faster-better-cheaper is achieved,
	Experience proves: there, politics is surely in command.
	If we are different from all others, past and present, Chinese and foreign,
	Then I ask: why make such a fuss?
	The liberated people are full of lofty aspirations:
	To transform the whole world, and conquer the planets in the universe.
	We will follow the Soviet Union, ride the east wind, and break through ten thousand miles of waves,
	Sailing our painted boat straight to the paradise of communism!
	The Big Brother has begun launching heavy earth satellites,
	To conduct spaceflights to the planets of the solar system.
	Little brother, I, will continue to leap forward at high speed for ten years,
	To step on the head of the old "lion on the double bed"! (Note)
	You are old, "honest" and dishonest "John"...
	"Uncle Sam" is also outwardly strong but inwardly weak, like a bum!
	Saying that our 1959 was the most dismal...
	Enough, shut your mouth and stop talking nonsense!
	The fact is: we are getting better day by day.
	The fact is: you are rotting day by day.
	Look at you, gold flowing out, the dollar depreciating.
	Fighting with "allies" for markets, like dogs fighting.
	We are: thriving and closely united.
	You are: tottering and falling apart.
	Look:
	The whole of Africa, hot as fire, has risen up—
	Standing on both sides of the scorching equator.
	Latin America, burning like a prairie fire—
	Burning in your backyard periphery.
	Nobusuke Kishi and Tojo Hideki were originally on the same path,
	But the Japanese people do not want to follow this dead end!
	Adenauer piously summons the spirit of Hitler,
	Let him also crawl into Hitler's tomb!
	Your doomsday has arrived!
	Our victory will surely come early!
	Look and listen:
	We soar freely in the highest heavens.
	We sing heartily above ground and below.
	Both hands will transform into a pair of wings.
	Dance and fly, maneuvering skillfully, controlling the sun.
	Sunlight shines on every corner—across the entire surface of the earth.
	The five continents and five oceans—a sea of red, a boundless radiance!

### 满堂红颂
萧三

    满堂红颂
    萧三
    我　大踏步　走在　长安街上，
    把　两只臂膀　用力　张开，
    捧住　从东方　升起的　太阳，
    迎接　二十世纪的　六十年代。
    太阳光　洒满了　天安门广场，
    洒上　全国　一片　大好河山，——
    从长白、昆仑　到长江、珠江……
    开门红，满堂红，　年年红光灿烂！
    我觉得，毛主席　正站在　楼台前面，
    他正在　检阅着　第二十个　“十一”。
    广场上　人山人海　走着　火箭、飞船
    主席他高瞻，他远瞩　未来的　十个世纪。
    万民欢腾，三呼万岁——海涛般呼啸。
    万树红旗　漫卷着　疾劲的　东风。
    过去十年　完成的指标　可以　自豪。
    未来十年　还要　攀登　高峰的　高峰。
    我　说不好　十年之后　将会怎样。
    只举出　朴素的　两个数字　设想设想：
    十年八年　能不能　再增产　几千万吨钢？
    十年八年　能不能　再增产　几千亿斤粮？
    朋友，你会说，我这些　太无诗意了？
    同志，我想问，难道你　没有志气了？
    无产阶级、共产党人　最富有　幻想！
    现代工业、现代农业……难道是　奢望？
    为了　改变　一穷二白的　面貌——
    党、毛主席　给了我们　三件法宝！！！
    党呀、毛主席呀，只要你　说一句话，
    六亿人　就会　浑身是劲！
    党呀、毛主席呀，你只要　定好计划，
    六亿人　就能　一跃而进！
    经验证明：那里作到　多快好省，
    经验证明：那里准是　政治挂帅。
    假如　我们　不同于　中外古今，
    那么　试问：　又何必　大惊小怪？
    解放了的　人民　有的是　壮志雄心：
    要改造　整个世界，征服　宇宙行星。
    我们要　随苏联　乘东风　破万里浪，
    把彩船　直开到　共产主义　天堂！
    老大哥　开始发射　重型地球卫星，
    向　太阳系行星　去作　宇宙飞行。
    小弟我　持续十年　高速度　跃进，
    要跨上　老牌　“双人床的狮子”的（注）头颈！
    你老了，“诚实的”、不诚实的“约翰”……
    “山姆大叔”　也外强中干，像个瘪三！
    说我们　1959年　最是暗淡……
    得了吧，你住嘴，别胡扯谈！
    事实是：我们　一天天　好。
    事实是：你们　一天天　烂。
    你看你　黄金外流，美元跌价。
    和“盟国”　争夺市场，像狗打架。
    我们是：欣欣向荣，亲密团结。
    你们是：摇摇欲坠，四分五裂。
    你看：
    整个非洲，火一样热的，站立起来了——
    站立在　滚烫的　赤道两边。
    拉丁美洲，像燎原似的　燃烧起来了——
    燃烧在　你们的　边沿后院。
    岸信介　和东条　本是同路人，
    日本人民　可不愿　走这条死路！
    阿登纳　虔诚地　为希特勒招魂，
    就让他　也钻进　希魔那座坟墓！
    你们的　末日　已经　来到！
    我们的　胜利　一定　提早！
    瞧吧，听吧：
    我们在　九霄云外　自由翱翔。
    我们在　地下天上　尽情歌唱。
    两只手　都要化为　一对翅膀。
    舞呀飞，灵活操纵，驾驭太阳。
    太阳光　投射到　每个角落——全地面上。
    五大洲，五大洋——满堂红透，万丈光芒！
            （注）借用马雅可夫斯基形容英国国徽语。
