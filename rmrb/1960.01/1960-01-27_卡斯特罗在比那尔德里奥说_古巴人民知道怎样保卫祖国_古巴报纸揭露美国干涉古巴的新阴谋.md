Xinhua News Agency, Havana, January 25th. Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro announced in Pinar del Río Province on the afternoon of the 24th that the heroic Cuban people will never allow others to seize their victory. The Cuban people have finally become the masters of their own destiny, and no one can stop them anymore. Threats can only increase their strength. People grow in the face of threats; the Cuban people's revolution is even more firm. Castro made these remarks when handing over the title deeds to 72 new houses to the farmers of the Saiz Brothers Tobacco Cooperative.

Prime Minister Castro emphasized that the Cuban people know how to defend their motherland. If some people fell in the past in order to achieve our victory today, then we will continue their legacy with a heroic spirit. Castro pointed out that the most powerful weapon to defeat the enemies of the revolution and the motherland is action. He said that the Cuban people must not only have militias and rifles to defeat the enemy, but also revolutionary construction projects, people's housing, schools, thousands of teachers, arable land, and tractors to improve people's living standards. He said that despite the enemy's attempt to stop us, and despite their attempts to slander the Cuban revolution abroad, we are still advancing the revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, January 26th. According to Cuban newspapers, rumors have been circulating since last Saturday that 10,000 U.S. Marines have landed at the U.S. Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba, and the U.S. Navy held naval exercises near the Virgin Islands, not far from Puerto Rico.

At the same time, people here are closely watching the frequent activities in Washington to officially plot intervention in Cuba. Following Eisenhower's secret talks with Secretary of State Herter on the 23rd about dealing with Cuba, Herter held an unusual Sunday meeting on the 24th with Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs Rubottom and U.S. Ambassador to Cuba Bonsal, who was summoned back to the country on the 23rd.

According to Rubottom, Bonsal "submitted an updated report" on the Cuban situation during the meeting. On the 25th, Eisenhower again discussed U.S.-Cuban relations with Herter, Rubottom, and Bonsal. According to the Associated Press, the meeting discussed "how to deal with Cuba" and the "possible actions" the United States "might take."

The Cuban "Hoy" newspaper commented that the enemy is trying to intimidate our people and put pressure on revolutionary forces. Faced with all these threats, the only answer from our heroic people is what Castro said: even if the Marines surround us, they cannot invade here, because here, they will fail no matter what.

    卡斯特罗在比那尔德里奥说
    古巴人民知道怎样保卫祖国
    古巴报纸揭露美国干涉古巴的新阴谋
    新华社哈瓦那25日电　古巴总理菲德尔·卡斯特罗24日下午在比那尔德里奥省宣布说，英勇的古巴人民决不允许别人夺取他们的胜利果实。古巴人民终于做了自己命运的主人，已经没有任何人阻挡得住他们了，威胁只能增加他们的力量。人民在威胁面前成长着；古巴人民的革命更加坚定了。卡斯特罗是在交给赛斯兄弟烟草合作社的农民七十二家新房的房契时讲这番话的。
    卡斯特罗总理强调说，古巴人民知道怎样去保卫祖国。如果说过去有一些人为了获得我们今天的胜利果实而倒了下去，那末，我们将以英雄主义的气概继续他们的遗志。卡斯特罗指出，事实是战胜革命和祖国的敌人的最有力的武器。他说，古巴人民不但要有民兵和步枪来战胜敌人，而且还要有革命的建筑工程、人民的住房、学校、成千上万的教师、耕地和拖拉机，来提高人民的生活水平。他说，尽管敌人妄图阻挡我们，尽管他们想在外国诽谤古巴革命，但是我们仍在推进革命。
    据新华社哈瓦那26日电　据古巴报纸报道，从上星期六起一直流传着这样的消息：美国海军陆战队一万人在美国在古巴的关塔那摩海军基地登陆，美国海军在离波多黎各不远的维尔京群岛附近举行了海军演习。
    同时，此间人士正在密切注视着华盛顿官方密谋干预古巴的频繁活动。继艾森豪威尔23日同国务卿赫脱密谈了对付古巴的问题以后，24日赫脱同负责拉丁美洲事务助理国务卿鲁博特姆和23日奉召回国的美国驻古巴大使邦沙尔举行了一次不平常的星期日会谈。
    据鲁博特姆说，邦沙尔在会谈时就古巴局势“提出了一项最新报告”。25日艾森豪威尔又同赫脱、鲁博特姆和邦沙尔一起讨论了美国同古巴的关系问题。据美联社消息说，这次会谈讨论了“如何对付古巴”的问题以及美国“可能采取的行动”。
    古巴“今日报”评论说，敌人企图恐吓我国人民，对革命力量施加压力。面对着所有这些威胁，我们英勇的人民的唯一回答，就是卡斯特罗所说过的话：尽管海军陆战队会包围我们，但是他们却不能侵入到这里，因为在这里，他们无论如何要失败。
