Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 25th: Armed clashes occurred between French extremist colonialists and French police in Algiers yesterday. According to an official communique issued in Algiers late yesterday, a total of nineteen people were killed and one hundred and forty-one were injured in the clashes.

    This bloody incident is the result of the surfacing of the conflict of interests between the本土金融殖民集团 (domestic financial colonial group) represented by French President De Gaulle and the French plantation owner colonial group in Algeria. The dismissal of General Massu, commander of the Algiers city defense and civil administrator, and head of the May 1958 fascist riots in Algiers, for publicly opposing De Gaulle's approach to the Algerian issue, aroused great dissatisfaction among French extremist colonialists representing the interests of plantation owners. Yesterday, these extremist colonialists held demonstrations in Algiers to express their support for Massu and their opposition to De Gaulle. According to reports, between fifteen and twenty thousand people participated in the demonstrations. They broke through the barriers of the army and police, entered the city center, and built barricades on the streets near the Place du Gouvernement there. Subsequently, these extremist colonialists clashed with the police. Until the evening, the extremist colonialists and the police were still in a standoff. About one to two thousand extremist colonialists were entrenched in barricades along a 500-meter stretch of the Algiers city center, while the police guarded the streets leading to the Place du Gouvernement and some government offices.

    On the same day, riots by colonialists also occurred in Oran, western Algeria. The colonialists attempted to seize the radio station but were unsuccessful.

    After the bloody incident, General Challe, commander-in-chief of the French army in Algeria, announced martial law in Algiers and banned gatherings of more than three people. He also sent additional troops to Algiers.

    This morning, Agence France-Presse notified all newspapers in Paris that it had lost access to telegrams and telephone calls from Algeria.

    French President De Gaulle and Prime Minister Debré, after receiving news of the riots in Algiers, immediately rushed back to Paris from other locations to consult with senior military authorities about the situation. This morning, De Gaulle delivered a radio address, saying that the riots were a heavy blow to France and to France's position in Algeria. He expressed his trust in his appointed Delegate General to Algeria, Delouvrier, the commander-in-chief of the French army, Challe, and the French colonial army, and called on the rioters not to "go astray" and rise up against him.

    At the same time, the French government announced a ban on public gatherings, demonstrations, and marches throughout France. Police forces in Paris have been strengthened.

    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 24th: This correspondent Yang Xiaonong reports: The dismissal of Pinay has just passed, and an even more serious crisis has broken out in the French ruling group. This is the argument over the Algerian policy issue, which has taken up a lot of space in the local newspapers and has become the center of people's discussions.

    This dispute has been going on for a long time, but in recent days it has become heated due to a speech by General Massu, commander of the Algiers city defense and civil administrator, and head of the May 13, 1958 fascist riots in Algiers. In this speech, published in the West German newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung" on the 18th, Massu publicly opposed De Gaulle's policy on Algeria. He said that De Gaulle's "concept" on the Algerian issue "is certainly not our (referring to the French army in Algeria) concept, we no longer understand President De Gaulle's policy." He even stated that the French officers in Algeria who supported De Gaulle's rise to power after the military riots of May 13, 1958, "may have done the wrong thing." He also threatened that "the army has enough power to impose its Algerian policy on the government when necessary." In commenting on this matter, the Paris newspaper "Le Monde" admitted that Massu's speech reflected the arguments of the French officers surrounding Massu.

    At the same time, the Federation of Mayors of the Algiers region also issued a statement criticizing De Gaulle's Algerian policy as a "complete failure" and threatening to "take up arms" if necessary to realize their claim to incorporate Algeria into France. They also clamored for the Algerian National Liberation Army to "surrender unconditionally." Other extremist colonialists in Algeria also waved flags and joined in the chorus.

    Massu's speech aroused great displeasure from De Gaulle. He quickly summoned Massu back to Paris to explain his behavior. On the evening of the 22nd, the French Ministry of the Armed Forces announced the dismissal of Massu from his current military and political positions in Algeria.

    This sharp struggle, described by French newspapers as a "battle of strength," reflects the conflict of interests between the French本土金融殖民集团 (domestic financial colonial group) and the fascist military group and its backers, namely the French plantation owner colonial group in Algeria.

    It is pointed out that the De Gaulle regime has extremely close ties with French financial oligarchs: "Banque de l'Union Parisienne," "Banque Rothschild," "Banque Lazard," "Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas," "Banque de l'Indochine," and other consortia have their own confidants in the government. They all have close ties with oil capital. It is estimated that in recent years, French monopoly capital groups have invested no less than £200 million to intensify the plunder of the Sahara's oil resources. Naturally, they are absolutely unwilling to give up their economic interests in Algeria. However, given the bleak prospects for military suppression, and the protracted Algerian war hindering their goal of achieving large-scale exploitation of Sahara oil to get rid of dependence on the US dollar area's oil, thereby strengthening France's economic and political position in the Western world, the representatives of these monopoly groups are increasingly inclined to seek a political solution that can guarantee French colonial interests while strengthening military suppression. A recent article in the Paris "L'Observateur" pointed out that De Gaulle's goal is simply to "patiently" realize a "De Gaulleized" Algeria, with a group of Muslims who both demand "autonomy" and recognize French protectorate in power.

    Now, De Gaulle has removed Massu from his post, that is, he has replaced the last remaining of the senior officers who launched the May 13th riots, and at the same time appointed his confidant Crépin to succeed him, in order to further control the army in Algeria. The government also announced a ban on Pierre Pflimlin, an important representative of the plantation owner colonial group in the political arena and former Prime Minister, from going to Algiers. But the struggle between the two factions is far from over.

    在阿尔及利亚的殖民政策陷于绝境
    法国统治集团内部发生严重冲突
    阿尔及利亚爆发极端殖民分子反戴高乐的武装骚乱
    新华社巴黎25日电　法国极端殖民主义分子和法国警察昨天在阿尔及尔发生武装冲突。据昨天深夜在阿尔及尔发表的官方公报，在这次冲突中双方共有十九人死亡，一百四十一人受伤。
    这次流血事件是以法国总统戴高乐为代表的本土金融殖民集团和阿尔及利亚境内法国庄园主殖民集团之间利害冲突表面化的结果。阿尔及尔城防司令兼民政长官、1958年5月阿尔及尔法西斯暴乱的头子马絮将军因为公开反对戴高乐在阿尔及利亚问题上的作法而被撤职一事，引起了代表庄园主利益的法国极端殖民分子的极大不满。昨天，这些极端殖民分子在阿尔及尔举行示威，表示支持马絮和反对戴高乐。据报道，参加示威的有一万五千人到二万人。他们冲破军队和警察的阻挡，进入市中心，并且在那里的议事广场附近的街道上筑起街垒。随后，这些极端殖民分子就同警察发生了武装冲突。直到晚上，极端殖民分子同警察仍在对峙中。约有一千到二千名极端殖民分子盘据着阿尔及尔市中心约五百公尺长的街垒，而警察则守着通往议事广场的街道和一些政府机关。
    同一天，阿尔及利亚西部的奥兰也发生了殖民主义分子骚乱的事件，殖民分子企图占领广播电台，但是没有成功。
    在流血事件发生后，法国驻阿尔及利亚军队总司令夏耳已经宣布在阿尔及尔戒严，并且禁止三个人以上的集会。他还增调军队到阿尔及尔去。
    今天早晨，法新社通知巴黎所有的报纸说，它已经得不到来自阿尔及利亚的电报和电话。
    法国总统戴高乐和总理德勃雷在接到阿尔及尔发生骚乱的消息后，马上从外地赶回巴黎，同高级军事当局会商局势。今天早晨，戴高乐发表广播演说，他说，这次暴动是对法国、对法国在阿尔及利亚的地位沉重打击。他表示信任他委派的驻阿尔及利亚总代表德路弗里埃、法军总司令夏耳和法国的殖民军队，并且要暴乱者不要“误入迷途”而起来反对他。
    同时，法国政府宣布，法国全境禁止举行公众集会、示威和游行。巴黎的警察力量已经加强。
    据新华社巴黎24日电　本社记者杨效农报道：比内被免职的事件刚刚过去，一个更加严重的危机又在法国统治集团中爆发。这就是占据此间报纸大量篇幅而且成了人们议论中心的关于对阿尔及利亚政策问题的争吵。
    这场争吵由来已久，但是这几天却由于阿尔及尔市城防司令兼民政长官、1958年5月13日阿尔及尔法西斯暴乱的头子马絮将军的一篇谈话而趋于白热化。在这篇西德报纸“南德意志报”18日发表的谈话中，马絮公开反对戴高乐对阿尔及利亚的政策。他说，戴高乐对阿尔及利亚问题上的“概念”“肯定不是我们（指法国在阿尔及利亚的军队）的概念，我们不再了解戴高乐总统的政策”。他甚至表示，在1958年5月13日的军事暴乱发生后在阿尔及利亚的法国军官们支持戴高乐上台“可能是做错了一件事”。他还威胁说，“军队有足够的力量在必要时把自己的阿尔及利亚政策强加在政府头上。”巴黎“世界报”在评述这件事时承认马絮的这篇谈话反映了围绕在马絮周围的法国军官们的论调。
    在这同时，阿尔及尔地区的市长联合会也发表声明抨击戴高乐的对阿尔及利亚政策是“彻头彻尾的失败”，并且扬言在必要时不惜“拿起武器”来实现他们要把阿尔及利亚并入法国的主张。他们还叫嚣要阿尔及利亚民族解放军“无条件投降”。在阿尔及利亚境内的其他极端殖民主义分子这时也摇旗呐喊，群起唱和。
    马絮的谈话发表后引起了戴高乐的极大不快。他很快把马絮召回巴黎，要他解释他的行为。22日晚上法国武装部队部宣布撤销马絮在阿尔及利亚现任的军政职位。
    这场被法国报纸形容为“实力较量”的尖锐斗争，反映了法国本土的金融殖民集团同法西斯军人集团及其后台，即阿尔及利亚境内的法国庄园主殖民集团之间的利益矛盾。
    人们指出，戴高乐政权同法国金融寡头有着极为密切的联系：“巴黎联合银行”、“罗希尔银行”、“拉萨尔银行”、“巴黎荷兰银行”、“东方汇理银行”等财团在政府中都有自己的亲信。它们又都同石油资本有密切联系。据估计，近年来法国垄断资本集团为了加紧掠夺撒哈拉石油富源投下了不下两亿英镑的资本。自然它们是绝不肯放弃在阿尔及利亚的经济利益的。不过，鉴于军事镇压的前途渺茫，而阿尔及利亚战争的旷日持久又有碍它们实现大规模开采撒哈拉石油以摆脱对美元区石油的依赖从而加强法国在西方世界的经济地位和政治地位的目标，因之这些垄断集团的代表越来越倾向于在加强军事镇压的同时，争取可以保证法国殖民利益的政治解决。最近一期巴黎“观察家周刊”在一篇文章中指出，戴高乐的目的不过是打算“有耐心”地实现一个“戴高乐化”的阿尔及利亚，由一批既要求“自治”而又承认法国保护权的穆斯林来掌握政权。
    现在，戴高乐撤了马絮的职，也就是说撤换了发动5月13日暴乱的高级军人中最后遗留的一个，同时委派了自己的亲信克雷班去继任他，以进一步控制阿尔及利亚的军队。政府还宣布禁止庄园主殖民集团在政界中的重要代表人物、前总理皮杜尔到阿尔及尔去。但是两派势力之间的斗争却远远没有结束。
