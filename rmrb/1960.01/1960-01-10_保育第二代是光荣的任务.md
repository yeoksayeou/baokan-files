Nurturing the Second Generation is a Glorious Task

Little baby, little bed,
Sleeping sweetly, sleeping soundly.
Standing by the bed, a kind nanny,
Gently touching, gently placing,
A small quilt, covering them,
Lest the baby catch a cold.

Skillful hands, bright heart,
Diligent care, better than their own mother.
Little saplings, growing quickly,
Flowers blooming brightly,
The gardener is overjoyed.

(Zhu Wei, Poem Accompaniment)

    保育第二代是光荣的任务小宝宝，睡小床，睡得甜，睡得香。床前站着好阿姨，轻轻摸，轻轻放，小被儿，给盖上，别叫宝宝着了凉。手儿巧，心儿亮，勤看护，胜亲娘。小幼苗，快快长，花儿开得鲜，园丁喜洋洋。
    （朱薇　配诗）
