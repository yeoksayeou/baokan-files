Relying on Local Industry to Support Agricultural Technical Transformation
中共忻定县委会 (The Xinding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party)

For more than a year, we have been using local industry as a base to carry out technical transformation of agriculture, and we have gained some experience. We adopted the method of "using light industry to support heavy industry, and using heavy industry to drive light industry" to quickly build a regional industrial system with a preliminary scale of mechanization and semi-mechanization. Now, all twenty people's communes in the county have their own machinery factories, and each management area has a machinery repair station (group). In the development of local industry, we have closely focused on the technical transformation of agriculture, and have strongly supported agriculture. In about a year, agriculture in the county has basically achieved water conservancy; chemical fertilizers have been popularized; and improved tools and many machines have been adopted in deep plowing, close planting, seedling protection, rice milling, flour milling, and other aspects; transportation has been motorized. All of the above not only saved us tens of thousands of laborers, but also turned 400,000 mu of saline-alkali land into fertile fields.

Following the Road of Self-Reliance

After the people's commune movement, the county Party committee, in order to accelerate the realization of the various indicators of the agricultural development program, vigorously promoted the construction of water conservancy projects and earthen chemical fertilizer plants. However, most of the newly started projects were manual operations, with low efficiency and high labor occupation, and there was an urgent need to replace them with machinery. How to achieve mechanization? The county Party committee believes that we should fully mobilize the masses and tap the potential of local industry to solve the problem through self-reliance. However, some people have a mentality of dependence and reach out to the state for machines. They said that the foundation of local industry is weak, and repairs and assembly are possible, but to carry out technical transformation of agriculture, we must rely on the state and large-scale industry for support, and small factories cannot do it. In response to this situation, the county Party committee launched a large-scale debate in the county's industrial system and among commune cadres, criticizing the mentality of waiting. Through debate and criticism, the people of the county realized that this great historical task of agricultural technical revolution requires the support of the state and large-scale industry; however, we should not completely rely on large-scale industry to supply all the technical equipment needed for agricultural technical transformation. Everyone unanimously agreed to first focus on local industry, arm local industry, take local industry as the outpost, and take the state's large-scale industry as the backing, to carry out technical transformation of agriculture through self-reliance.

Using Light Industry to Support Heavy Industry, and Using Heavy Industry to Drive Light Industry

The county Party committee believes that light industry requires less investment, yields faster returns, and generates more profits. Moreover, Xinding County established iron and steel plants and machinery plants and other heavy industrial factories in 1958, and the people's commune movement has opened up sources of raw materials for light industry, which has provided a rich material basis for the development of light industry. Therefore, it was decided to adopt the principle of "using light industry to support heavy industry, using heavy industry to drive light industry, and promoting industry and agriculture together" to develop local industry. All people's communes in the county, according to the instructions of the county Party committee, first vigorously promoted light industry. They used indigenous methods, adapted to local conditions, established factories based on available resources, and established factories based on the needs of agriculture, trying every means to build factories. The Satellite Commune, which has a lot of saline-alkali land, wanted to build an earthen chemical fertilizer plant, so it sent 500 commune members to work in a nearby state-owned farm for a day, and used the 500 yuan earned from their labor as investment. They built the factory while producing, and quickly developed from rudimentary production equipment consisting of three pots, seven jars, and two wooden buckets for carrying water to eight workshops, producing a total of 4.53 million jin of five kinds of fertilizers, including ammonium sulfate, mixed fertilizer, and fertilizer powder, enabling 225,000 mu of land to use 20 jin per mu. They also produced ten kinds of chemical raw materials, such as saltpeter, soda ash, potassium nitrate, and sodium nitrate. Due to the utilization of saline-alkali, 1,500 mu of saline-alkali land were planted with crops for the first time. People saw that it was so easy to build factories and that the benefits were so great, so they raised funds to build factories. In one quarter, they established four factories for papermaking, chemical industry, and power, and expanded twelve county-run factories for livestock products, agricultural and sideline products, and waste product processing. In less than a year, these factories provided more than 900,000 yuan of funds, purchased crushers, small generators, electric motors, large brick and tile machines, and various lathes, transformers, etc., so that all manual factories were equipped, and factories that could only carry out simple repairs were transformed into factories capable of manufacturing various equipment.

After the county-run factories were able to manufacture equipment, they in turn equipped light industry. The machinery factories successively manufactured hundreds of sets of various mechanical equipment, equipping all the factories in eleven industries in the light industry system, such as agricultural and sideline product processing and papermaking, and equipping two newly built machine-made paper factories from start to finish.

Equipping Commune-Run Industry

After the county-run industry was preliminarily equipped, the county Party committee immediately freed up its hands to vigorously promote commune-run industry. First, we designated each commune to transfer three to five cadres to establish and improve the industrial organizations of the communes. Subsequently, the county Party committee, with the county-run factories as the backbone, continuously held on-site meetings to promote the factory management experience and production experience of the county-run industry, so as to promote the commune-run industry. This approach has achieved great results. In order to meet the needs of agricultural production, the commune-run industry urgently needed to build chemical fertilizer plants, but they could not find the way. The county Party committee organized all the commune-run industries in the county to hold an on-site meeting at the county-run chemical fertilizer plant. People learned and went back to build, and in three months, all communes in the county built 106 large and small chemical fertilizer plants. Industries such as sugar making, wine making, papermaking, and flour processing also adopted the method of on-site meetings to promote them. In less than a year, commune-run industries and management areas in the county built a total of 777 machinery factories, brick and tile factories, weaving factories, mining factories, oil factories, etc.

After the commune-run industry developed generally, the county Party committee mobilized the county-run factories, especially the county-run machinery factories, to support the commune-run industry, and listed arming the commune-run industry as an important task of the county-run factories. Since August of last year, the county-run machinery factories have provided various lathes and iron and wood electric saws, electric planers, grooving machines, riveting machines, drilling machines, etc., to the commune-run industry, and have successively trained more than 1,600 technicians for the communes, and transformed the commune agricultural tool repair and assembly factories into agricultural tool machinery repair and manufacturing factories. In this way, the county formed a powerful agricultural tool technical transformation network with the county-run industry as the backbone and the commune industry as the foundation.

In order to facilitate the undertaking of various tasks of agricultural technical transformation in a guided and planned manner, the county-run industry and the commune industry made the following division of labor: the county-run industry mainly undertakes the county's manufacturing tasks and new machine trial production tasks, and the commune industry mainly undertakes the county's agricultural machinery repair and assembly tasks. Due to the clear division of labor and mutual cooperation, it was possible to ensure that water conservancy construction tools and agricultural tools would not be repaired outside the county for major repairs, outside the commune for medium repairs, and outside the district for minor repairs, which greatly facilitated agricultural production and reduced the burden on large-scale industry in this regard.

Mutual Promotion of Industry and Agriculture

In order to comprehensively realize the technical transformation of agriculture, we established a county-wide industrial support agriculture committee headed by the county Party committee's industrial secretary, and regularly held industrial and agricultural cooperation meetings to allow the agricultural sector to propose topics that require industrial support. After each topic is proposed, the county Party committee will formally make a decision, and then the county Party committee's industrial secretary will take the lead, and the entire county will be mobilized from top to bottom to resolutely complete it. Because the county Party committee grasped it tightly, all factories and mines in the county regarded supporting agricultural production as the most important task. The workers established a strong concept of "everything for agricultural production." As long as agriculture comes up with a topic, the workers always go all out and rack their brains to try to manufacture it. No one in Xinding County had ever seen a generator, and no one knew how to make it. However, when agriculture put forward this topic, the county-run First Machinery Factory immediately accepted the task, and the entire factory was mobilized, from the Party committee secretary and factory director to every worker, everyone contributed ideas, and at the same time sent veteran workers to other places to learn from experience. Comrade Huang Zuoxin, the county Party committee's industrial secretary, also worked with the workers, fighting hard for seven days and seven nights, and finally made a generator. Subsequently, a county-wide on-site meeting was held to mobilize various machinery factories to try to manufacture it, and soon 20 generators were made, meeting the requirements of agricultural production at that time. Over the past year, the county's industrial system has created and modified a total of more than 27,000 pieces of disc harrows, double-shared plows, walking plows, mud dredgers, and power mills for agriculture, increasing the efficiency of agricultural production and construction by one to one hundred times. In water conservancy construction alone, 53,000 laborers were saved this year. In addition, 33,950 various vehicles were produced, and more than 85% of the vehicles were equipped with ball bearings. During the autumn harvest in 1959, the county completed the transportation task more than 20 days earlier than in the same period in 1958.

Due to the industrial support for agriculture, the relationship between industry and agriculture has been further strengthened. A year ago, comrades in the agricultural production system generally believed that rural areas could only engage in agriculture and could not engage in industry, and that industry excessively occupied the labor force (at that time, industrial production was mostly manual operations). When industry made any demands on agriculture, they did not actively support it. Now, a new atmosphere has emerged between industry and agriculture, and agriculture is particularly concerned about the development of industry. Whatever industry needs, as long as agriculture can do it, it always tries to do it. This year, the light industrial factories felt that raw materials were difficult to obtain, so the agricultural front put forward the slogan: under the premise of ensuring increased grain production, vigorously open up raw material bases for industry. In addition to increasing the yield per unit area on basic farmland, it also used land to grow cotton, sunflowers, sugar beets, medicinal materials, hemp, etc., reaching 170,000 mu. After harvesting, it can not only fully supply the raw materials needed by the existing light industrial factories in the county, but also solve the raw material problems of some newly built factories. At present, the biggest difficulty in production in various factories and mines is that transportation cannot keep up with the needs of production, so the people's communes in the county have transferred 500 large carts to support. The county-run gravel plant's road for transporting river sand was not convenient, so the Party committee secretary of the Satellite Commune led all commune members to fight hard for a day on New Year's Day to build a road for the gravel plant.

    依靠地方工业支援农业技术改造
    中共忻定县委会
    一年多以来，我们以地方工业为基地，对农业进行技术改造，摸到了一些经验。我们采取以轻养重、以重带轻的办法，迅速地建成了一个初具规模的机械化半机械化的地区工业体系。现在，全县二十个人民公社，社社有机械厂，每个管理区有机械修配站（组）。在发展地方工业中，我们紧紧地以农业技术改造为中心，有力地支援了农业。在一年左右的时间内，全县的农业基本上实现了水利化；化肥普及了；在深耕、密植、保苗、碾米、磨面等方面，采用了改良工具和许多机械；运输实现了车子化。以上这些，不仅使我们节省了数万个劳动力，而且使四十万亩盐碱地变成了良田。
    走自力更生的道路
    人民公社化以后，县委为了加速实现农业发展纲要的各项指标，大抓水利建设和土化肥厂的建设。但是，新开工的工程，绝大部分是手工操作，效率低，占用劳力多，迫切要求用机械来代替。怎样实现机械化呢？县委认为，应该充分发动群众，挖掘地方工业潜力，用自力更生的方法来解决。但是，有些人却存在依赖思想，伸手向国家要机器。他们说，地方工业基础薄弱，修修配配还可以，对农业进行技术改造，必须依靠国家和大工业支援，小工厂办不了。县委针对这一情况，发动全县工业系统和公社干部展开了大辩论，批判了等待思想。从辩论批判中，全县人民认识到：农业技术革命这项伟大历史任务，是需要国家和大工业的支援；但是，不应该把农业技术改造所需要的全部技术装备，完全指靠大工业来供应。大家一致同意首先抓地方工业，武装地方工业，以地方工业为前哨，以国家大工业为后盾，自力更生地对农业进行技术改造。
    以轻养重以重带轻
    县委认为，轻工业投资少，收益快，得利多，而且忻定县在1958年建立了钢铁厂和机械厂等重工业工厂，人民公社化以后，又为轻工业开辟了原料来源，这些都为发展轻工业提供了丰富的物质基础。因此，决定采取“以轻养重，以重带轻，工农互相促进”的原则发展地方工业。全县各人民公社根据县委的指示，首先大抓轻工业。土法上马，因地制宜，有什么资源办什么工厂，农业需要什么工厂就办什么工厂，千方百计地想办法建厂。盐碱地多的卫星公社要办土化肥厂，派了五百个社员到附近的国营农场劳动了一天，将劳动所得的五百元作为投资，一边建厂一边生产，由三口锅、七口缸、两担木水桶的简陋生产设备，很快发展到八个车间，生产了硫酸錏、混合肥料、肥田粉等五种肥料共四百五十三万斤，使二十二万五千亩地每亩使用了二十斤，还生产了火硝、纯碱、硝酸钾、硝酸钠等十种化工原料。由于盐碱被利用，使一千五百亩盐碱地第一次种上了庄稼。人们看到办工厂这样容易，好处又这样大，纷纷自筹资金办厂。在一个季度里，就办起了造纸、化工、动力等四个厂，扩建了畜产品、农副产品、废品加工等十二个县营工厂。不到一年，这些工厂就提供了九十多万元资金，购置了粉碎机、小型发电机、电动机、大型砖瓦机和各种车床、变压器等等，使所有手工操作的工厂都得到了装备，使只能进行简单修理的工厂变为能够制造各种设备的工厂。
    县营工厂能够制造设备以后，反过来又装备了轻工业。各机械厂先后制造了各种机械设备数百台，装备了轻工业系统的农副产品加工业、造纸业等十一个行业的所有工厂，并且从头到尾装备了两个新建的机制纸工厂。
    装备社办工业
    在县营工业得到了初步的装备以后，县委立即腾出手来大抓社办工业。我们首先指定每个公社抽调三至五名干部，建立和健全了公社的工业机构。随着，县委又以县营工厂为骨干，不断地召开现场会议，推广县营工业办厂经验和生产经验，以促进社办工业。这样做，收到了很大的效果。社营工业为了满足农业生产的需要，急需办化肥厂，但都不得其门。县委就组织全县社办工业在县营化肥厂开了现场会。人们学了回去就办，三个月，全县各公社办起了大小化肥厂一百零六座。制糖、制酒、造纸、面粉加工等行业也都采取现场会的办法促进，不到一年工夫，全县社工业和管理区建成机械厂、砖瓦厂、编织厂、采矿厂、油厂等共七百七十七座。
    当社办工业普遍发展起来以后，县委又发动县营各厂，特别是县营机械工厂，支援社办工业，把武装社办工业列为县营工厂的重要任务。从去年8月以来，各县营机械工厂已为社营工业提供了各种车床和铁木制的电锯、电刨、挖槽机、开铆机、钻孔机等一百二十多部，先后为公社培养了技术人员一千六百多名，并把公社农具修配厂改造成为农具机械修造厂。这样，全县以县营工业为骨干，公社工业为基础，形成了一个强大的农具技术改造网。
    为了便于有领导、有计划地负担农业技术改造的各种任务，县营工业和公社工业作了这样的分工：县营工业主要担负全县的制造任务和新机器试制任务，社营工业主要担负全县农业机械的修配任务。由于分工明确，协作互助，作到了水利建设工具和农具大修不出县，中修不出社，小修不出区，大大便利了农业生产，也减轻了大工业在这方面的负担。
    工农业互相促进
    为了全面实现对农业的技术改造，我们以县委工业书记为首，成立了全县工业支援农业委员会，定期召开工农业协作会，让农业方面提出需要工业支援的课题。每次课题提出以后，县委都要正式作出决定，然后由县委工业书记挂帅，从上到下全县大发动，坚决完成。由于县委抓得紧，全县各厂矿都把支援农业生产当成最重要的任务。工人们树立了“一切为了农业生产”的强烈观念。只要农业出了课题，工人们总是全力以赴，挖空心思去试制。忻定全县人都没见过发电机，谁也不会制。但当农业上提出这个课题时，县营第一机械厂立即接受了这个任务，全厂总动员，从党委书记、厂长到每个工人，个个献计，同时派老工人到外地取经。县委工业书记黄作信同志也和工人一起，苦战了七天七夜，终于制出了发电机。随后又召开全县现场会，发动各机械厂试制，很快制出了二十台发电机，满足了当时农业生产的要求。一年来，县工业系统共为农业创造和改制了圆盘耙、双铧犁、步犁、挖泥机、动力磨共二万七千多件，使农业生产和建设的效率提高一倍至一百倍。仅水利建设一项，今年就节省了五万三千个劳动力。另外还生产了各种车辆三万三千九百五十辆，85％以上的车辆都安上了滚珠轴承。在1959年秋收中，全县比1958年同期缩短二十多天完成了运输任务。
    由于工业对农业的支援，进一步密切了工农业的关系。一年以前，农业生产系统的同志普遍认为农村只能搞农业，不能搞工业，嫌工业过多的占用了劳动力（当时工业生产大都是手工操作），工业向农业提出什么要求，不积极支援。现在，工农业之间出现了一片新气象，农业对工业的发展特别关心。工业上需要什么，只要农业上可以办到的，总是设法办到。今年，轻工业各工厂觉得原料困难，农业战线上就提出口号：在保证粮食增产的前提下，大力为工业开辟原料基地。除在基本农田上提高单位面积产量外，还利用土地种棉花、葵花、甜菜、药材、大麻等达十七万亩。收获以后，不仅可以充分供应现有全县轻工业工厂所需的原料，一部分新建厂的原料问题也解决了。目前，各厂矿生产上最大的困难是运输跟不上生产需要，全县各人民公社便抽调了五百辆大车来支援。县营砂石厂运河砂的路不方便，卫星公社的党委书记便在元旦休假日带领全体社员苦战了一天，为砂石厂修了一条公路。
