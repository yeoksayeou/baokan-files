Better Year by Year
Albania　Aleks Çaçi

1959 has passed. Young Albania has been born for fifteen years. At this time, I recall many things. I remember that at that time, many cities and villages in Albania were burned down by Italian and German fascists and traitors, countless mothers wore black mourning clothes, and the earth was scorched by the enemy's war. How clear it is that many children became orphans! This is war... Our enemies at home and abroad always try to subdue the people under their clutches. They said, "These children won't grow up!" They dreamed of returning to Albania to re-enslave the people. This is simply a pipe dream!

The initial days after liberation were difficult. However, under the leadership of the Party, the people began to heal the wounds of war with great enthusiasm. Where did such great enthusiasm come from? The people poured out the strength they had accumulated for centuries like a river. I remember so clearly how we fought to eliminate poverty at that time. Our slogan was: "Build our backward country into a prosperous country", and build Albania, which was full of illiteracy, without railways, and without factories, into an advanced country! This is the oath the people made to the Party. With great enthusiasm, the people rebuilt their homes destroyed by the war like a storm. Barefoot and in ragged clothes, they threw themselves into the battle to build new cities. Like in wartime, the brilliance of Moscow illuminated their path. In our country, whether adults or children, they all yearned for the Soviet Union from the bottom of their hearts. Our people sang the most beautiful songs to praise the Soviet state. They sang, "Lenin is the sun and the moon."

Under the guidance of the Party, our people know how to overcome difficulties with their own strength. They know that imperialist aid is tantamount to death. Therefore, there is a proverb circulating among our people: "Americans use a small piece of meat to exchange for your mare," "Americans use a small piece of meat to exchange for your cow and calf," "Always keep your eyes open, and you can catch saboteurs and spies." The enemy is always waiting for an opportunity to sabotage our cause, so we must be vigilant. Today, Albania is already a strong country, and the people can find their true friends everywhere, just as we say there: "True friends cannot be bought with money." Under such circumstances, our people overcame all obstacles and built a beautiful socialist garden, their faces facing the most sublime ideal of mankind: communism.

After living in China for more than two years, I returned to my country half a year ago. I was really dazzled! When I got off the plane and walked towards Tirana, I almost suspected that I had taken the wrong road. Ah! Everything there smiled and shimmered at me. The earth is so beautiful, and the trees and grass all present a kind of eternal verdant color. People's faces have also become more beautiful. All of this made me feel infinitely happy. I thought: "I have returned from a prosperous and happy country to my own motherland, and life here is also blossoming!" We are advancing at such a huge pace. Like the Chinese people, the Albanian people, and all the fraternal people, today, they have broken free from the chains on their feet and are striding forward, forward, and forward non-stop... I greedily looked at everything around me, new buildings, gardens, children's smiles. Everywhere, I saw the same scene, in Durrës, in Shkodër, in Vlorë, in the Marx Hydroelectric Power Station, in agricultural cooperatives... joyful songs were echoing everywhere. Our pace forward is not calculated in years or months, but in hours and seconds. When I returned to Beijing with renewed encouragement, what amazing changes were presented before my eyes! I only left Beijing for three weeks, but what I saw before me was another Beijing. Tiananmen Square, Dongdan, and other streets in the city have changed. New houses have been built from the ground up. The fraternal Chinese people, under the leadership of their dear Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the friend of our people, have driven away the old and built the new. They are a living example for the entire Asian people! I see that the face of China is changing with each passing day. In places that were desolate and uninhabited in the past, life is now blossoming; in places where floods and droughts caused millions of deaths in the past, wheat and rice are now growing luxuriantly. On the green land, the slaves of yesterday are breathing freely. The U.S. imperialists are afraid of the Chinese people because they can no longer do whatever they want on Chinese soil as they did in the past, because the people's eyes are sharp, and they know how to walk their own path. The U.S. imperialists talk about "peace" in words, but in fact, they are afraid of peace and also afraid of war. The U.S. imperialists are in a situation just like a common saying among our people: on one side is water, on the other side is fire, it's simply a dead end! The Chinese people are advancing bravely and firmly like the waves of the sea. Just as our people say: brave people are always loved. The Chinese people have their own friends in the Soviet Union, in all socialist countries, and in every corner of the world.

1959 has passed. For the people, this is a great year. In this year, the forces defending peace have been strengthened, and in our national construction, we have achieved even greater victories than in 1958. This year, the fraternal Chinese people greeted the tenth anniversary of the founding of their country with unparalleled achievements, and even the enemies had to admit these great achievements. This year, the Albanian people also celebrated the fifteenth anniversary of liberation. The people greeted these two festivals with great joy, and they contributed even greater strength to the struggle to defend peace and happiness. 1960 will bring us new victories, the socialist camp will become stronger, and new cosmic rockets will fly in the universe. Together with the advanced Soviet people, we will fly higher, while our enemies will fall lower. Our people are entering 1960 with new plans, and the people of the world are entering 1960 with new efforts to defend peace and block the road to war. Shoulder to shoulder, like comrades who will never separate under any circumstances, we advance together. Before liberation, the Albanian people always said: "Each year is worse than the last!" But today they say: "Each year is better than the last!"

    一年比一年好
    阿尔巴尼亚　阿列克斯·恰奇
    1959年过去了。年轻的阿尔巴尼亚已经诞生了十五年。在这个时候，我回忆起很多事情。我记得那个时候，阿尔巴尼亚的许多城市和乡村都被意大利和德国法西斯分子以及卖国贼所焚毁，无数的母亲穿着黑色的丧服，大地也被敌人的战火烧焦，许多孩子成为孤儿，多么清楚！这就是战争……我们国内外的敌人总是企图使人民屈服在他们的魔掌下。他们说：“这些孩子长不了！”他们梦想再返回阿尔巴尼亚来重新奴役人民。这简直是白日做梦！
    解放后最初的日子是困难的。但是，在党的领导下，人民以巨大的干劲开始医治战争的创伤。这么大的干劲从哪儿来的？人民把储备了数世纪的力量像江水一般地倾泻出来。我记得多么清楚，那个时候我们是怎样为消灭贫困而战斗。我们的口号是：“将我们落后的国家建设成为繁荣的国家”，将充斥着文盲、没有铁路、没有工厂的阿尔巴尼亚建设成为一个先进的国家！这就是人民在党面前所发的誓言。人民怀着巨大的热情，像暴风雨般重建起被战争破坏了的家园。他们光着脚，穿着破烂衣服，投入了建设新城市的战斗。像战时一样，莫斯科的光辉照耀着他们的道路。在我们国家内，不论是成年人还是小孩，都从内心向往着苏联。我国人民用最美妙的歌曲歌颂苏维埃国家。他们唱道：“列宁是太阳和月亮”。
    在党教导下的我国人民知道如何用自己的力量来克服困难。他们知道帝国主义的援助就等于死亡。因此，在我国人民中流传着这样的谚语：“美国人用一小块肉把你的母马换去”、“美国用一小块肉把你的母牛和小牛犊换去”、“经常睁着眼睛，你就能抓到破坏分子和特务”。敌人时时刻刻在伺机破坏我们的事业，必须提高警惕。今天的阿尔巴尼亚已经是一个强大的国家，人民在各个地方都能找到他们真正的朋友，正像我们那儿所说的：“用钱换不来的真朋友”。我国人民就在这种情况下，克服了一切障碍，建设着美丽的社会主义的花园，他们的面孔朝着人类最崇高的理想：共产主义。
    在中国住了两年多以后，半年以前我又回到了我的国家。我真是眼花撩乱了！当我走下飞机朝地拉那走去时，我简直怀疑自己走错了路。啊！那里每一件东西都向我微笑和闪烁着光辉。大地是多么美，树木和草丛都呈现出一种永恒的青翠。人们的面孔也变的更加美丽了。这一切真使我感到无限的欢欣。我想：“我从一个繁荣幸福的国家回到自己的祖国，而这里生活也在开着花！”我们以多么巨大的步伐前进着，中国人民、阿尔巴尼亚人民和所有的兄弟人民一样，今天，已经挣脱了脚上的锁链，在大踏步地前进，前进，不停地前进……我贪婪地望着周围的一切，新的建筑物、花园、孩子的微笑。在各个地方，我都看到了同样的景象，在都拉斯，在斯库台，在发罗拉，在马克思水电站，在农业合作社……各个地方都响着愉快的歌声。我们前进的步伐不是用年、月而是用时、秒来计算的。当我满怀着鼓舞的力量又回到北京时，多么惊人的变化又呈现在我眼前！我只离开北京三个星期，可是在我面前的却已是另一个北京。天安门、东单和城市中的其他街道都变了样子。新的房屋一座座地平地建起了。兄弟的中国人民，在和他们有血肉联系的、亲爱的党和我国人民的朋友毛泽东同志的领导下，已经把旧的东西驱逐掉，把新的东西建设起来。他们是整个亚洲人民的活生生的榜样！我看到中国的面貌在日新月异地变化着，在过去荒凉和寂无人烟的地方，今天生活在开着花；在过去水旱灾害造成几百万人死亡的地方，今天小麦和水稻在茂盛地生长着。在绿油油的大地上，昨天的奴隶在自由地呼吸。美帝国主义者害怕中国人民，因为它再不能像过去一样在中国土地上随心所欲，因为人民的眼睛是雪亮的，他们知道怎样走自己的路。美帝国主义者口头上讲“和平”，但是事实上他们害怕和平，也害怕战争。美帝国主义者的处境就像我国人民所说的一句俗话：一边是水，一边是火，简直是穷途末路！中国人民像大海的波涛一样，勇敢、坚强地前进着。正像我国人民所说的：勇敢的人永远受人敬爱。中国人民在苏联、在所有社会主义国家和在世界的每个角落都有自己的朋友。
    1959年过去了。对于人民来说，这是伟大的一年。在这一年中，保卫和平的力量加强了，在我们的国家建设中，我们获得了比1958年更为巨大的胜利。这一年，兄弟的中国人民以无比的成就迎接了建国十周年，连敌人也不得不承认这些伟大的成就。这一年，阿尔巴尼亚人民也庆祝了解放十五周年，人民用极大的欢欣迎接这两个节日，他们对保卫和平和幸福的斗争贡献出了更大的力量。1960年将带给我们新的胜利，社会主义阵营将更加强大，新的宇宙火箭将在宇宙间飞行。我们和先进的苏联人民一起将飞得更高，而我们的敌人则将落得更低。我们的人民怀着新的计划进入1960年，世界上的人民带着为保卫和平、堵塞战争道路的新的努力进入1960年。我们肩并着肩，像在任何情况下永不分离的同志一样，共同前进。阿尔巴尼亚人民在解放以前总是说：“一年比一年坏！”而今天他们说：“一年比一年好！”
