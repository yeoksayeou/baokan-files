    Counterpart competitions, opponent competitions, competitions are like nets, flags are like forests, learn from the models, catch up with the models, leap over '59 and then leap into '60.
    Picture by Fang Yuquan, worker at the Beijing Electron Tube Factory. Poem by Zhang Jue, staff member.

    对口赛，对手赛，竞赛如网旗如林，学标兵，赶标兵，跃过五九再跃六零。
