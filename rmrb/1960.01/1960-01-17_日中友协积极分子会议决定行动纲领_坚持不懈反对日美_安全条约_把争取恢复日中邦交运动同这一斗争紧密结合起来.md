Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 15th: The Japan-China Friendship Association held a meeting of activists in Tokyo today to discuss the action program against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

This program stipulates that the association will persistently oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty," recognizing that the movement against the revision of the "Security Treaty" is part of the overall struggle for Japanese independence. The action program emphasizes that the association will strengthen cooperation with other peace organizations.

The action program states: The association will strive to carry out propaganda activities, explaining the necessity of restoring diplomatic relations with China, so that public opinion will be more in favor of friendship with China.

The program also emphasizes that the association should strengthen propaganda activities to clarify China's peaceful policies and introduce China's peaceful construction.

The meeting adopted the statement on recent Sino-Japanese relations passed by the Standing Council of the Japan-China Friendship Association on January 12. This statement exposes the true intention of some leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party who said that the next step after the revision of the "Security Treaty" is to solve the Sino-Japanese problem. The statement said that they made such remarks in order to make the revision of the "Security Treaty" a fait accompli, to make the people have the illusion that even if the "Security Treaty" is revised, solving the relationship with China would still be easy, so as to frustrate the movement to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" which is currently closely linked with the movement to improve Sino-Japanese relations. The statement continued: "Although we cannot ignore a certain contradiction within the Liberal Democratic Party revealed in these remarks, we must still be vigilant about the true intentions of the Liberal Democratic Party politicians in making such remarks."

The statement stated that the Japan-China Friendship Association will continue to do its utmost to smash the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and closely integrate the movement to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations with the movement against the "Security Treaty," in accordance with the policy formulated by the association's previous congress.

The meeting also passed a resolution to increase personnel exchanges between China and Japan.

    日中友协积极分子会议决定行动纲领
    坚持不懈反对日美“安全条约”
    把争取恢复日中邦交运动同这一斗争紧密结合起来
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会今天在东京召开这个协会的积极分子会议，讨论反对日美“安全条约”的行动纲领。
    这个纲领规定，协会将坚持不懈地反对修改“安全条约”，认识到反对修改“安全条约”运动是争取日本独立的全面斗争的一部分。行动纲领强调指出，协会将加强同其它和平组织的合作。
    行动纲领说：协会将努力进行宣传活动，解释必须恢复同中国的外交关系，以使舆论更加拥护同中国友好。
    纲领还强调指出，协会应该加强宣传活动，来阐明中国的和平政策，介绍中国从事和平建设的情况。
    会议通过了日中友好协会常务理事会1月12日所通过的关于最近日中关系的声明。这个声明揭露了自由民主党一些领导人所说日本在修改“安全条约”之后下一步工作就是解决日中问题这种话的真正意图。声明说，他们发表这种言论，目的在于使修改“安全条约”成为既成事实，使人民产生认为尽管修改了“安全条约”，解决同中国的关系问题还是轻而易举的这种幻想，以便挫败目前同争取改善日中关系运动紧密联系在一起的阻止修改“安全条约”运动。声明继续说：“虽然我们不能忽视这些言论中透露出来的自由民主党内部的某种矛盾，但是我们仍然必须对自由民主党政客发表这种言论的真正意图保持警惕”。
    声明表示，日中友好协会将按照协会前一次代表大会所制定的方针，继续尽最大努力来粉碎日美“安全条约”，把争取恢复日中邦交运动同反对“安全条约”的运动紧密结合起来。
    会议还通过决议，要增进日中两国的人员来往。
