After the Hitler armies occupied France, he was imprisoned in a concentration camp in France until the end of the war, when he regained his freedom.

    In the liberated German territories, Heinrich Rau initially served as the Second Deputy Chairman of the Brandenburg State Government, where he actively promoted local land reform.

    When the German Economic Commission was established in what was then East Germany, Heinrich Rau took charge of this institution. After the founding of the German Democratic Republic, he served as Minister of Planning.

    In 1952, Heinrich Rau became Deputy Prime Minister, and in 1953, he also served as Minister of Mechanical Engineering. From 1954, he concurrently served as Minister for Foreign and Intra-German Trade. Heinrich Rau is a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.
