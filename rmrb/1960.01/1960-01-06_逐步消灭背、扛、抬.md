    Gradually Eliminate Carrying on the Back, Shouldering, and Lifting
    With the deepening of technical innovation and the technical revolution, production has increased by multiples, even dozens of times. However, in some auxiliary departments and among auxiliary workers in factories and mines, there still exists a large amount of heavy manual labor such as carrying on the back, shouldering, lifting, and pulling. This not only results in low work efficiency and a large number of workers being occupied but also high labor intensity. Often, delays in transportation and delivery can cause blockages of raw materials, semi-finished products, or finished products.
    How to solve this problem? There are two ways: one is simply to increase the number of auxiliary workers. The result of doing so is excessive personnel, decreased labor productivity, and increased costs. This is not a good solution. The other is to vigorously promote mechanization and semi-mechanization, tap potential in all aspects, and strive to improve labor efficiency. This is the fundamental and effective way to develop production.
    The movement to vigorously promote mechanization and semi-mechanization in the auxiliary departments of factories and mines in Tianjin shows that doing so has five benefits: first, it guarantees production development and continuous improvement of labor productivity; second, it shortens the production cycle and accelerates capital turnover; third, it saves manpower and reduces labor intensity; fourth, it lowers costs and improves product quality; fifth, the realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization in internal transportation and loading/unloading in factories and mines can free up a large amount of social transportation capacity, which helps to solve the contradiction of insufficient transportation capacity. With so many benefits, the widespread promotion of Tianjin's practices is of great significance.

    逐步消灭背、扛、抬
    随着技术革新和技术革命的深入开展，生产成倍、几十倍的增长；而厂矿企业的一些辅助部门和辅助工人，至今还存在着大量的背、扛、抬、拉等笨重体力劳动。这样，不仅工作效率低，占用的劳动力多，而且劳动强度高。往往因为搬运、传送不及时，还会造成原料材料、半成品或成品的堵塞现象。
    如何解决这个问题呢？办法有二：一是单纯的增加辅助工人，这样做的结果是，人员过多，劳动生产率下降，成本增高，这不是一条好办法。一是大搞机械化、半机械化，挖掘各方面的潜力，努力提高劳动效率，这是发展生产的根本办法，也是行之有效的办法。
    天津市厂矿企业辅助部门大搞机械化、半机械化的运动表明，这样做的好处有五：一、保证生产发展，劳动生产率不断提高；二、缩短生产周期，加速资金周转；三、节约人力，减轻劳动强度；四、降低成本，提高产品质量；五、厂矿企业内部的搬运、装卸实现机械化、半机械化，可以腾出占用的大批社会运输力，有助于解决运力不足的矛盾。好处如此之多，普遍推广天津的做法，就有着重大的意义了。
