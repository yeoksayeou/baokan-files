Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, January 5th: The latest issue of the Moroccan "Avant-Garde" published an article entitled "War or Peace?" criticizing U.S. President Eisenhower's recent statement declaring the United States "free to resume nuclear testing." The article said, "This serious measure not only damages the relaxation of the international situation but will also encourage the French government to explode an atomic bomb in the Sahara in March."

The article said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization conference recently decided to rapidly and substantially strengthen its military forces. The highest-level Western conference did not change the West's consistent stance at all; on the contrary, it reiterated the same old demands. New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller also demanded that military superiority be regained at all costs. The article pointed out that all of this shows that the West is still continuing the Cold War.

    摩洛哥“前卫报”说
    西方继续加紧冷战
    据新华社拉巴特5日电　最近一期的摩洛哥“前卫报”发表了一篇题为“要战争还是要和平？”的文章，抨击美国总统艾森豪威尔最近发表的宣布美国“有恢复核试验的自由”的声明。文章说，“这个严重的措施不仅损害国际局势的缓和，而且将鼓励法国政府3月间在撒哈拉爆炸原子弹。”
    文章说，北大西洋公约组织的会议不久前决定迅速地、大量地加强它的军事力量。西方最高级会议根本没有改变西方的一贯立场，恰恰相反，它重申老一套的要求。美国纽约州州长洛克菲勒也要求不惜一切代价地重新取得军事优势。文章指出，这一切说明西方还在继续进行冷战。
