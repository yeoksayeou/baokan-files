    People Mountain People Sea, Streets Full of Flowers
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporters Guan Zhendong and Ding Ming
    Guangzhou's annual flower market is especially lively this year. On New Year's Eve, the lively scene reached its peak. Before nightfall, people gathered from all directions to the flower market. A sea of people, an endless spring scene to behold.

    With the continuous leap forward in the socialist construction of the motherland, the flower farmers are becoming more and more motivated. This year, the flower market has a wide variety and colorful array of flowers. The Fujian daffodils, praised as "water fairies in a simple hall," are bathed in colored lights; the Shandong peonies, which "uniquely occupy the first spring in the world," bloom with new buds in the evening breeze. New varieties that were rarely seen or never seen in previous years, such as the "cyclamen" which looks like rabbit ears, "flowering kale" and "stone eggs" were all transported from Tianjin and other places to "meet the market" or for introduction. Among the myriad of colors, the peony and kumquat are the most dazzling and attractive. In the peony grove, each flower is as thick as a bowl, like a ball of red fire.

    The flowers displayed in this year's flower market, in addition to being supplied by Guangzhou's state-owned companies and parks, are all planted by the people's communes. There are the famous Gaoyao and Qingyuan's Chinese New Year flowers, Luogang's plums, and Hedong's peach blossoms, etc. Hedong Commune suffered from floods last year. Flower buyers were worried that they would not be able to buy "lightly dyed rouge" peach blossoms in the flower market. However, when they arrived at the flower market, they saw that peach blossoms occupied half the street. Some people asked the members of Hedong Commune in surprise: "The peach blossoms have been flooded, how can they bloom so well?" The commune members said with a smile: "The people's commune has great power. When the peach trees were hit by the disaster last year, the production brigades of the whole commune and the workers of nearby factories came to rescue them, thus avoiding the loss." After the establishment of this commune, 396 mu of wasteland were newly opened and a large garden was built. More than 140 flower farmers were transferred from major teams to specialize in growing flowers. This year, this commune set up four flower stalls in the flower market, with all kinds of flowers, it is really a competition of hundreds of flowers, vying for beauty.

    In previous years, people often said: Spring is on the branches. However, this year, people deeply felt that the smiling faces of the flower viewers were more radiant than the colors of the flowers. Young wives held their husbands' arms and carefully selected the most beautiful flowers in front of the flower stands; fathers let their children ride on their shoulders, joyfully squeezing through the crowd, and even some revolutionary disabled soldiers who had made immortal contributions to the people drove their hand-cranked vehicles into the flower market. Among these spring-faced people, there are workers who have just gotten off work from the factory, farmers who have rushed over after attending the completion ceremony on the water conservancy construction site, naval fighters who have returned from the sea, and overseas Chinese who have recently returned to the warm embrace of the motherland after enduring hardships. Zhou Fugang, a young steel rolling worker from the Shijing Iron and Steel Plant in the suburbs of the city who had just taken a vacation, ran to the flower market without taking off his work clothes. He bought a bouquet of dahlias and chrysanthemums, ready to take them home to celebrate the New Year with his family.

    Late at night, the sound of firecrackers sent from afar gradually subsided, but the flower market was still brightly lit and the flow of people was constant. (Attached picture)

    人山人海花满街
    新华社记者　关振东　丁明
    广州市一年一度的花市今年特别热闹。除夕晚，花市的热闹景象达到最高峰。夜色还没有降临，人们就从四面八方汇集到花市。人山人海，满眼春光收不尽。
    随着祖国社会主义建设的连续跃进，花农们的干劲越来越足。今年花市品种繁多，色彩缤纷。被赞为“水中仙子素一堂”的福建水仙，浴着彩色灯光；“独占人间第一春”的山东牡丹，迎着晚风绽开新蕊。往年很少见或者从未见过的新品种，如像免耳朵一样的“仙客来”，“花叶甘蓝”和“石蛋”都是从天津等地运来“应市”或引种的。万紫丛中，芍药和金桔最耀眼惹人。芍药林里，朵朵花有碗口来粗，像一团团红火。
    今年花市上陈列的花卉，除了由广州的几家国营公司和公园等单位供应的外，其他的都是人民公社栽植的。这里有著名的高要、清远的吊钟，罗岗的梅，鹤洞的桃花等等。鹤洞公社去年曾经遭受水灾，买花人很担心在花市上买不到“淡染胭脂”的桃花，但是，来到花市一看，桃花却占了半条街。有些人惊奇地向鹤洞公社的社员问道：“桃花受过水灾怎么还开得这样好呀？”社员们笑盈盈地说：“人民公社力量大，去年桃树受灾时，全社的生产大队和附近工厂的工人都来抢救，因而避免了损失。”这个公社成立后，新开了三百九十六亩荒地，建成一座大花园，从各大队抽调了一百四十多名花农专门种花。今年，这个公社在花市上摆了四档花，各式各样的花卉都有，真是百花斗丽，万艳争妍。
    往年人们常说：春天在花枝上。可是，今年人们深深地感到心花怒放的看花人，面上的春光比花色更灿烂。年轻的妻子挽着丈夫在花架前细细挑选最美丽的花朵；作父亲的让孩子们骑在自己的肩膀上，喜气洋洋地在人丛中挤来挤去，连一些为人民立下不毁功劳的革命残废军人，也驾着手摇车驶进花市来了。在这些满面春风的人群里，有刚从工厂下班出来的工人，有在水利工地上开完庆祝竣工大会以后赶来的农民，有从海上归来的海军战士，还有历尽艰苦、最近重归祖国温暖怀抱的海外华侨……。刚刚休假的市郊石井钢铁厂青年轧钢工人周富光，工作服还没脱下就跑来花市。他选购了一束大丽和黄菊，准备带回家去和家人们欢庆新春。
    深夜，远处送来的炮竹声逐渐稀落，但花市仍然华灯如昼，人流不息。（附图片）
    春节来到，广州一年一度的花市又开始了。
