Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 12th: The United States House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee released a report on January 10th regarding the United States' policy towards Europe (Western Europe). The report was drafted by members of the special panel of the European Affairs Subcommittee of this committee. This panel visited Britain, Ireland, Denmark, France, Switzerland, West Germany, Italy, and other Western European countries last September.

The report points out that the purpose of this visit was: "to evaluate, based on first-hand materials, the United States' policies and programs in the economic, political, and social fields." The report's drafters stated that they were particularly concerned about the "effectiveness" of American foreign policy, the state of the North Atlantic bloc, the relationship between the two opposing economic blocs in Western Europe, and the so-called "Soviet economic offensive and its consequences," among other issues.

The report's drafters regretfully acknowledge the contradictions and differences existing among the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. They complain that the United States' military spending in Europe is too high, emphasizing that America's partners "should share more of the costs of Western common defense." However, they have to admit that the situation in Western Europe is clearly unfavorable to this, because "general discussions of common defense cannot conceal the mistrust and even indifference towards the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that Western European countries often display."

The report also points out that "the lack of unity in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not fully explained by the opposition between the United States and our European partners alone. The current political and economic contradictions between France and Britain, and between Britain and Germany, also have a certain impact. As long as partners have differing opinions on each other's participation (in the alliance), they will be unwilling to spend more money for these purposes."

The report's drafters said they were greatly disturbed by the actions of America's allies. They wrote: "France has unilaterally reduced its naval obligations to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the Mediterranean. It has refused to store atomic weapons jointly supervised and used with the United States on its territory. France has transferred two divisions allocated to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to Algeria. Britain has also reduced its ground forces in Europe. Britain's flexible attitude towards negotiations with the Soviet Union and its role in establishing the Seven-Nation Group to compete with the Six-Nation Common Market have also had consequences for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

Based on on-the-ground investigations, the report's drafters reached the following conclusion: "Europeans no longer rely on our economic assistance. We should now lead, not dictate. Given the growing interest in negotiating with the Soviet Union, this is a heavy burden for us."

The report believes that the division of Western Europe into two trade blocs may have serious consequences for the capitalist world. The members of this panel expressed ambivalence about resolving this issue. On the one hand, they fear that maintaining these two blocs will deepen the political divisions among America's allies, making it more difficult for the United States to pursue its own policies in Europe; on the other hand, they fear that the establishment of a unified economic bloc by Western European countries will sharpen competition between these countries and the United States, harming the interests of American companies. They emphasize that "as the industrial competitiveness of walled-off European (Western European) countries increases, some sectors of American industry are entirely likely to be harmed."

The report's drafters point out that the United States' exports to the Western European "Free Trade Association" and "Common Market" countries are decreasing day by day. As a means of penetrating the Western European market, they suggest that American companies pay more attention to establishing subsidiaries in the respective countries than in the past, in order to bypass the tariff barriers established against them.

The report's drafters do not shy away from the fact that their visit to Western Europe was also due to the inability of the United States and its allies to achieve the same enormous achievements that the Soviet Union has recently made in science and economics. The report's drafters are clearly afraid of the relaxation of international tensions and the establishment of mutually beneficial trade relations between socialist countries and certain Western European countries. They point out that "most European countries have established trade relations with the Soviet bloc." They emphasize that "certain aspects of this trade make the members of the subcommittee uneasy." For example, they angrily point out that Denmark prefers to buy Soviet oil rather than American oil.

The Soviet Union's selfless assistance to underdeveloped countries makes these American congressmen particularly uneasy. The report's drafters believe that underdeveloped countries have shown open anti-colonial and anti-Western sentiments. They emphasize: "In addition, the Soviet Union may provide an example of how an underdeveloped country has achieved such great success with the help of communist doctrines." The report emphasizes, "This is very tempting evidence, and the West cannot underestimate it."

### 美众院外委会发表对西欧政策的报告  承认美国同西欧国家间存在严重分歧

    美众院外委会发表对西欧政策的报告
    承认美国同西欧国家间存在严重分歧
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿12日讯：美国国会众议院外交委员会10日发表了一项关于美国对欧洲（西欧）的政策的报告。报告起草人是这个委员会的欧洲问题小组委员会特别小组的成员。这个小组在去年9月访问了英国、爱尔兰、丹麦、法国、瑞士、西德、意大利和其他一些西欧国家。
    报告指出，这次访问的目的是：“根据第一手材料来估价美国在经济、政治和社会方面的政策和计划。”报告起草人表示，他们特别关心美国外交政策的“效果”、北大西洋集团状况、西欧两个对立经济集团的关系以及所谓“苏联的经济攻势及其后果”等问题。
    报告起草人懊丧地承认北大西洋公约成员国之间存在矛盾和分歧。他们抱怨美国在欧洲的军费开支太高，强调美国的伙伴们“应当更多地分担西方共同防御经费”。但是他们不得不承认，西欧的情况对此显然是不利的，因为“泛泛的议论共同防御并不能掩饰西欧国家经常表现出来的对北大西洋公约组织的不信任和甚至对它的冷淡态度”。
    报告还指出，“仅仅在美国和我们的欧洲伙伴对立这方面，还不能充分说明北大西洋公约组织缺乏团结。法英、英德当前的政治、经济矛盾也有一定的影响。只要伙伴之间在彼此参加（联盟）方面存在意见分歧，也就不会愿意拿出更多的钱用于这些目的”。
    报告起草人说，他们对美国的盟国的做法感到极大不安。他们写道：“法国单方面地缩小了它对北大西洋公约组织在地中海承担的海军义务。它已经拒绝在本国领土上储存同美国共同监督使用的原子武器。法国已把它拨给北大西洋公约组织的两个师调到阿尔及利亚。英国也减少了它在欧洲的地面部队。英国对待同苏联的谈判的灵活态度以及它在建立与六国共同市场相抗衡的七国集团中起的作用，对北大西洋公约组织也产生了后果”。
  报告起草人根据实地的调查得出了如下的结论：“欧洲人再也不依赖我们的经济援助了。我们现在应该领导，而不是发号施令。鉴于对跟苏联谈判的兴趣越来越大，这对我们是一个沉重的负担”。
    报告认为，西欧分裂为两个贸易集团可能对资本主义世界产生严重后果。这个小组的成员对解决这个问题表现左右为难。一方面，他们担心保持这两个集团会加深美国盟国之间的政治分歧，这会使美国在欧洲推行自己的政策更加困难；另一方面，他们害怕西欧国家成立一个统一的经济集团会使这些国家同美国的竞争尖锐化，有损美国公司的利益。他们着重指出，“随着筑有壁垒的欧洲（西欧）国家工业竞争能力的加强，美国的一些工业部门完全有可能受到损害”。
    报告起草人指出，美国向西欧“自由贸易联盟”和“共同市场”国家的输出在日益减少。作为渗入西欧市场的手段，他们建议美国公司要比过去更加重视在相应的国家设立子公司，以此来绕过针对它们建立的关税壁垒。
    报告起草人并不讳言，他们对西欧的访问也是由于美国及其盟国无力取得苏联最近在科学和经济方面所取得的那样巨大成就而引起的。报告起草人显然是害怕国际紧张局势缓和，害怕社会主义国家同西欧某些国家建立互利的贸易关系。他们指出，“欧洲大多数国家同苏联集团建立了贸易关系”。他们着重指出，“这种贸易的某些方面使小组委员会的成员感到不安”。例如，他们气忿地指出，丹麦宁愿购买苏联的石油，而不购买美国的石油。
    苏联对不发达国家的无私援助使这些美国国会议员感到特别不安。报告起草人认为，不发达国家表现了公开的反殖民主义情绪和反西方的情绪。他们强调说：“此外，苏联可能提供一个榜样，说明一个不发达国家如何依靠共产主义学说的帮助取得了现在这样伟大的成就。”报告强调，“这是一个非常诱人的证据，西方不能对它估计过低”。
