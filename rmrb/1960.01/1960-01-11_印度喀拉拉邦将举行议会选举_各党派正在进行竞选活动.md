Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 10th: According to an earlier announcement by Indian officials, mid-term elections for the Kerala State Assembly in India will be held on February 1st. Newspaper reports indicate that 470 candidates from various political parties are participating in the election, competing for the 126 seats in the State Legislative Assembly.

According to newspaper reports, the main contenders in this election are a three-party alliance consisting of the Congress Party, the Praja Socialist Party, and the Muslim League on one side, and the Communist Party of India and the independent individuals it supports on the other. Four other smaller parties, including the Revolutionary Socialist Party, are also participating. The three-party alliance is reportedly also supported by the Catholic forces in Kerala.

Reports say that the distribution of the 126 seats being contested by the three-party alliance is as follows: the Congress Party has nominated candidates for 80 seats; the Praja Socialist Party for 34; and the Muslim League for 12. The Communist Party of India is contesting 103 seats and supporting 23 independent candidates. The remaining smaller parties are contesting a total of 38 seats.

According to newspaper reports, the main leaders of the Congress Party will campaign for the candidates of the three-party alliance. Nehru himself will arrive in Kerala before January 18th. Congress Party leaders such as Desai and Patil will arrive in the second week of January.

It is understood that the Communist Party's campaign is already in full swing. According to the Indian News Agency, the campaign is being carried out by 300,000 to 400,000 workers. Former Kerala Chief Minister Namboodiripad recently stated in the "New Age" weekly that the broad masses support the Communist Party and independent candidates.

The latest issue of the "New Age" weekly published a statement from the Kerala Communist Party, calling for peaceful and fair elections.

In the last general election (1957), the Communist Party of India won 60 seats, with another five independent individuals supporting the Communist Party. According to the Indian Constitution, the Communist Party of India obtained a majority in the State Legislative Assembly and formed the state government. In June of last year, the then-opposition Congress Party, Praja Socialist Party, and Muslim League, along with reactionary religious forces, incited a movement to overthrow the state government. On July 31st, the President announced the takeover of the state government. According to the Indian Constitution, the President's takeover can only last for a maximum of six months, during which new elections should be held.

    印度喀拉拉邦将举行议会选举
    各党派正在进行竞选活动
    新华社新德里10日电　据印度官方早些时候公布，印度喀拉拉邦议会期中选举将在2月1日举行。据报纸报道，参加竞选的各政党提出了四百七十个候选人，他们将竞选邦立法会议的一百二十六个席位。
    据报纸报道，参加这次竞选的主要是以国大党、人民社会党和穆斯林联盟结成的三党联盟为一方，和印度共产党及它支持的无党派人士形成的另一方。其他革命社会党等四个小党也参加了竞选。据报道，三党联盟还得到喀拉拉邦的天主教势力的支持。
    消息说，三党联盟竞选一百二十六席的分配是：国大党提出了八十个议席的候选人；人民社会党提出了三十四个；穆斯林联盟提出了十二个。印度共产党竞选一百零三个议席并支持二十三个无党派人士的竞选。其余的小党共竞选三十八个议席。
    据报纸消息，国大党的主要领袖们将为三党联盟的候选人进行竞选运动。尼赫鲁本人将于1月18日前来喀拉拉邦。国大党领袖们如德赛和柏蒂尔将于1月第二周前来。
    据悉，共产党的竞选运动已经在大力进行。据印度新闻社报道，竞选运动由三、四十万工人在进行。前喀拉拉邦首席部长南布迪里巴德最近在“新世纪”周报上说，广大的群众支持共产党和无党派独立候选人。
    最近一期的“新世纪”周报登载了喀拉拉邦共产党的声明，呼吁举行和平与公正的选举。
    印度共产党在上次大选中（1957年）获得六十个席位，另有五名无党派人士支持共产党。按照印度宪法，印度共产党取得了邦立法会议的多数而组成了邦政府。去年6月，喀拉拉邦当时的反对党国大党、人民社会党和穆斯林联盟和反动教派势力煽动推翻邦政府的运动。到7月31日，总统宣布接管邦政府。按照印度宪法，总统接管最多只能有六个月，在这期间应当重新举行选举。
