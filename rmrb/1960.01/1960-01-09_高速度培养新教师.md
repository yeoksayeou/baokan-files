    High-Speed Training of New Teachers
    Qimin
    The great development of industrial and agricultural production requires that education keep pace rapidly. A key to whether education can keep pace is whether there are a sufficient number of qualified teachers. Therefore, quickly training a group of new teachers so that they can competently undertake teaching work is a major task on the current education front.
    Can the training of teachers be carried out at high speed? That is to say, can a large number of qualified new teachers be trained in a short period of time? The experience of Tongji University proves that it is entirely possible. The problem lies in the leadership of the school and the fact that new and old teachers must emancipate their minds and break superstitions. What superstitions should be broken? We must break the superstition that "the work of training teachers is different from engaging in production; production can leap forward, but teacher training can only proceed slowly." We must fully recognize that as long as we exert sufficient effort and give play to subjective initiative, the training of new teachers can be greatly accelerated. The leadership of Tongji University precisely recognized the requirements of the objective situation, broke the superstition of "only proceeding slowly," established the confidence and courage to train teachers at high speed, and adopted a variety of methods to accelerate the training of new teachers, achieving tremendous achievements in a very short period of time. From the leadership's point of view, it not only strengthens leadership but also boldly trusts and trains new teachers, creating all possible conditions for new teachers to study, practice, and improve, so that they not only have time to read, prepare lessons, and seek guidance from teachers, but also have the opportunity to participate in on-site drills. From the point of view of new teachers, they must be educated to raise their thinking, establish great ambitions, work hard to study, exert maximum effort, and not stop until they achieve their goals. As a result of doing so, the growth rate of new teachers at Tongji University has greatly accelerated.
    To train new teachers at high speed, we must dare to act and act vigorously. The vigorous action mentioned here is not only about formulating a plan for training teachers, but more importantly, about mobilizing the enthusiasm of all teachers and students and taking the mass line. As long as everyone's enthusiasm is mobilized and everyone's wisdom is brought into play, various good methods and experiences for training new teachers will emerge like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Many veteran teachers at Tongji University have adopted the method of masters leading apprentices; some have opened basic course discussion classes for young teachers, and some provide young teachers with what they lack. After painstaking study and short-term drills, many new teachers are able to teach independently and teach quite well. These are also the results of their leadership's vigorous action.
    Accelerating the training of teachers in education work is a product of the high-speed development of socialist education in our country. And accelerating the growth of new forces and promoting the expansion of the teaching force has promoted the great development of education. Tongji University and many other examples have proved this truth thousands of times.

    高速度培养新教师
    启民
    工农业生产的大发展，要求教育事业迅速跟上去。而教育事业能不能跟上去的关键之一，是有没有足够数量的合格的教师，因此，迅速培养出一批新教师，使他们能胜任地担负起教学工作，是当前教育战线上一个重大的任务。
    培养教师能不能高速度地进行呢？就是说在短时间内能不能培养出大批合格的新教师呢？同济大学的经验证明，是完全能够做到的。问题就在于学校领导上和新老教师都要解放思想，破除迷信。破除什么迷信？要破除那些“培养教师的工作不同于搞生产，生产可以跃进，教师培养工作只能慢慢来”的迷信，充分地认识到，只要鼓足干劲，发挥主观能动作用，新教师的培养是可以大大加快的。同济大学领导上正是看清了客观形势的要求，打破了“只能慢慢来”的迷信，树立了高速度培养教师的信心和勇气，采用了多种多样的方法加速培养新教师，在很短的时间内就取得了巨大的成就。从领导方面说，既加强领导，又大胆放手地去培养新教师，给新教师创造一切可能的学习和锻炼提高的条件，使他们不仅有读书备课、求师受教的时间，还要有参加现场练兵的机会。从新教师方面说，要教育他们，提高他们的思想，使他们树立大志，下苦功钻研，鼓足最大干劲，不达目的不停止。这样做的结果，同济大学新教师的成长速度就大大加快了。
    要高速度地培养新教师，必须敢干，大干。这里所说的大干，不仅仅是要订出培养教师的计划，最重要的是要调动全体师生的积极性，大走群众路线。只要调动了大家的积极性，发挥了大家的智慧，那么，各种培养新教师的好办法、好经验，就会像雨后春笋一样涌现出来。同济大学的许多老教师都采取师傅带徒弟的方法，有的为青年教师开办了基础课讨论班，有的为青年教师缺啥补啥。许多新教师经过刻苦钻研和短期的练兵以后，就能够独立教课，而且教的相当好。这些也就是因为他们有领导的大干的结果。
    教育工作中加速培养教师，是我国社会主义教育高速度发展的产物。而加速新生力量的成长，促进教师队伍的壮大，又推动了教育事业大发展。同济大学以及其他许多例子，千万次地证明了这个真理。
