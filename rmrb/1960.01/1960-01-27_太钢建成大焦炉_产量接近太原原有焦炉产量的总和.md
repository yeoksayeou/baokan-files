    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Completes Large Coke Oven
    Output Approaching the Total of Taiyuan's Original Coke Ovens
    The newly built large-scale coking furnace of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company has recently been put into production.
  This newly built large coke oven has a total of sixty-five holes. Its output approaches the sum of Taiyuan's original coke production. The coke produced by this new coke oven can not only meet the needs of the large blast furnace of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, which is about to be completed, but also support the city's metallurgical enterprises.
    The new large coke oven has a high degree of mechanization and automation. All the equipment, except for the blower, was designed domestically.
    This coke oven was built with the help of the Soviet Union and the cooperation of domestic brother enterprises.

    太钢建成大焦炉
    产量接近太原原有焦炉产量的总和
    太原钢铁公司新建大型炼焦炉已在最近投入生产。
  这座新建的大型焦炉共六十五孔。它的产量接近太原市原有焦炭产量的总和。这座新焦炉炼出的焦炭，不仅可以满足太原钢铁公司即将完工的大型高炉的需要，而且可以支援全市的冶金企业。
    这座大型焦炉的机械化自动化程度很高。全部设备除了鼓风机以外，都是国内设计的。
    这座焦炉是在苏联的帮助和国内兄弟企业的协作下建成的。
