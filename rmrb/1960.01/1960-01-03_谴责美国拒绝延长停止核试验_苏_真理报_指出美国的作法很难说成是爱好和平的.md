    Condemning the United States for Refusing to Extend the Suspension of Nuclear Testing
    Soviet "Pravda" Points Out That the U.S. Action Can Hardly Be Called Peace-Loving
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 31st: TASS reports that "Pravda" published an article on the 30th entitled "The Struggle for Disarmament is a Noble Cause." The article points out that people around the world warmly support the call for complete and thorough disarmament made by Soviet government head Khrushchev on the platform of the United Nations on September 18, 1959. Under the pressure of the masses, officials in major capitalist countries have also spoken of the need to carefully and earnestly study the Soviet proposal. However, the article emphasizes, it is an inexcusable short-sighted act to underestimate the influential enemies of peace who hold high political leadership positions in many Western countries.
    The article says that it has been more than two months since the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued an appeal to the parliaments of all countries in the world to stop the arms race and achieve complete and thorough disarmament. The legislative bodies of socialist countries have all endorsed the proposals of the Soviet parliamentarians. However, the parliaments of Western countries remain silent on this urgent issue. The article's author asks, how can actions such as arming the revanchist West German Federal Defense Forces with nuclear weapons be linked to the fine words of some Western leaders? And the recent meeting of the aggressive bloc of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization spent a great deal of energy on precisely this matter. The U.S. government's refusal to extend the suspension of nuclear testing can hardly be called a manifestation of peace-loving intentions.
    The article concludes by pointing out that people in all parts of the world expect an immediate solution to the urgent issue of disarmament, and they will spare no effort to fight for peace and complete and thorough disarmament. The Soviet Union stands at the forefront of the fighters for a bright future for humanity.

    谴责美国拒绝延长停止核试验
    苏“真理报”指出美国的作法很难说成是爱好和平的
    据新华社12月31日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”30日刊登了一篇题为“争取裁军的斗争是崇高的事业”的文章。文章指出，世界各地的人们热烈拥护苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫1959年9月18日在联合国的讲坛上提出的全面彻底裁军的呼吁。在人民群众的压力下，主要资本主义国家的官方人士也谈起仔细地、认真地研究苏联建议的必要性来了。但是，文章强调指出，轻视在许多西方国家里担任高级政治领导人的、影响颇大的和平敌人是一种不可原谅的眼光短浅的行为。
    文章说，苏联最高苏维埃向世界各国议会发出停止军备竞赛并实现全面彻底裁军的呼吁已经两个多月了。社会主义国家的立法机关都赞成苏联议员的建议。但是，西方国家的议会仍然对这个迫切的问题保持沉默。文章作者问道，像以核武器武装复仇主义的西德联邦国防军这样的行为，又怎样同西方某些国家领导人的漂亮词句联系在一起呢？而不久前举行的北大西洋公约组织这一侵略集团的会议正是把不少精力花费在这件事情上的。美国政府拒绝延长暂停核试验的期限这件事也很难说成是爱好和平的表示。
    文章最后指出，世界各个地区的人都期望立即解决裁军这一迫切的问题，他们不惜一切努力为和平和全面彻底裁军而斗争。苏联站在为人类光明未来而奋斗的战士的最前列。
