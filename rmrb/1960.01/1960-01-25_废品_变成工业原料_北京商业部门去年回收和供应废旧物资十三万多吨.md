"Waste" Turns into Industrial Raw Materials
Beijing Commercial Departments Recovered and Supplied Over 130,000 Tons of Scrap Materials Last Year

    (Our Newspaper's News) Beijing's scrap material recovery departments actively serve production through the recovery and supply of scrap materials, playing the role of a production logistics department.

    In 1959, the city recovered over 130,000 tons of various non-ferrous metals, scrap steel, waste paper, rags, etc., which were supplied to relevant production departments, playing a significant role in increasing the production of daily necessities and small commodities. For example, the supply of cloth scraps, shoe soles, and waste paper to the paper-making sector accounted for over 68% of the city's paper-making materials; rags (including support from other regions) accounted for about 80% of the city's shoe-making raw materials; and over 7,000 tons of broken glass were supplied to departments producing bottles and glassware, ensuring the normal production of many factories that had previously felt a shortage of raw materials. The recovered scrap steel, in addition to a portion handed over to the central government, was supplied to some hardware processing factories and handicraft production cooperatives in the city, increasing the production of many small commodities in urgent demand in the market, such as shoe eyelets, hair clips, and eyeglass cases. Many iron factories in the suburbs used the recovered scrap steel to make various small farm tools, meeting the needs of agricultural production. The repair and maintenance industry also obtained a large amount of raw materials from scrap materials.

    Party committees at all levels in Beijing have dedicated personnel leading the work of scrap material recovery. People's Committees of all districts have established scrap material recovery command posts and offices, strengthening and expanding the scrap material recovery team. Currently, there are more than 1,830 purchasing personnel in the city, and the number of mobile purchasing vehicles has increased from more than 200 in the past to more than 700. Party organizations have continuously conducted political and ideological education for the purchasing personnel, making all personnel realize the important significance of scrap material recovery work for economic construction. This has ensured the regular operation of scrap material recovery work.

    In order to facilitate the public in selling scrap materials, in addition to appropriately increasing the number of purchasing points and purchasing personnel, Beijing also relies on street offices and retail stores to assist in collection, establishing a mass-based scrap material recovery network throughout the city.

    Beijing's scrap material recovery departments have made some new creations and improvements in supply work. On the basis of proactively signing supply agreements, three new supply methods have been adopted. First, city and district scrap material balance exchange meetings are held regularly to trade various scrap materials. This large-scale material adjustment can ensure that materials are used to their full potential. For example, in the past, they recovered angle aluminum and nickel-chromium steel but did not know which units needed them; the radio factory under the Municipal Light Industry Bureau had been affected in production because it could not buy nickel-chromium steel, angle aluminum, and other production raw materials. Through the citywide scrap material balance meeting, these raw materials were found, meeting the needs of production. Second, based on the balance meeting, the supply method of on-site distribution of goods is adopted. On-site distribution not only reduces intermediate links but also makes distribution more practical, facilitating the grasp of priorities and allocating materials rationally. Third, units with scrap materials are organized to directly link up with production units for supply, which can reduce intermediate transportation links and facilitate timely support for production. For example, the paper bag cooperative in Xuanwu District used to use new white cloth to seal paper bags, while the bandage strips cut off by the health materials factory every day were just suitable for the paper bag cooperative to use. After the recovery department organized direct linkage, both parties were very satisfied. This can save the country more than 3,000 meters of white cloth every month and greatly reduce the cost of paper bags.

    Beijing's scrap material recovery departments are determined to continue to act as a good production logistics department, striving to double the recovery of scrap materials this year compared to the 1959 plan.

    “废品”变成工业原料
    北京商业部门去年回收和供应废旧物资十三万多吨
    本报讯　北京市废旧物资回收部门通过废旧物资回收和供应工作，积极为生产服务，起到了生产后勤部的作用。
    在1959年中，全市共回收各种有色金属、废钢铁、废纸、破布等十三万多吨，供应给有关生产部门，对增产日用品和小商品等起了很大作用。如供应造纸部门的布毛、鞋底、废纸，占全市造纸材料的68％以上；破布（包括外地支援）占全市制鞋原料的80％左右；供给生产瓶子、玻璃器皿部门的碎玻璃七千多吨，使许多原来感到原料不足的工厂保证了正常生产。回收到的废钢铁，除上缴给中央一部分外，供应给本市一些五金加工厂和手工业生产合作社，增产了鞋眼、发卡、眼镜盒等许多种市场急需的小商品。郊区许多铁工厂把回收的废旧钢材制成了各种小农具，供应了农业生产需要。修配、修理行业，也从废旧物资中得到了大批原料。
    北京市各级党委都设有专人领导废旧物资回收工作。各区人民委员会都成立了废旧物资回收指挥部、办公室等机构，健全和扩大了废旧物资回收队伍，现在全市收购人员已有一千八百三十多人，流动收购车由过去的二百多辆增加到了七百多辆。党组织对收购人员不断地进行了政治思想教育，使全体人员认识到了废旧物资回收工作对经济建设的重要意义。这样就保证了废旧物资回收工作经常化。
    为了便利群众出售废旧物资，北京市除适当增加了收购点和收购人员外，还依靠街道办事处和零售商店协助代收，使全市建立了一个群众性的废旧物资回收网。
    北京市废旧物资回收部门在供应工作方面有一些新的创造和改进。在主动上门签订供应协议的基础上，采取了三种新的供应方式。一是经常召开市、区废旧物资平衡交流会，成交各种废旧物资。这种大范围的物资调剂，可以作到物尽其用。如过去他们回收了角铝、镍烙钢，不知道哪些单位需要；市轻工业局所属无线电厂却曾因买不到镍烙钢、角铝等生产原料而影响生产，通过全市废旧物资平衡会议，找到了这些原材料，满足了生产需要。二是在平衡会议的基础上，采取现场分货的供应方法。现场分货不但减少了中间环节，而且使分配更切合实际，便于掌握轻重缓急，合理分配物资。三是组织有废旧品单位同生产单位直接挂钩供应，这样可以减少中间运输环节，便于及时支援生产。如宣武区纸袋社生产的纸袋，过去一直用新白布封口，而卫生材料厂每天裁下的绷布条正适合纸袋社使用。经回收部门组织直接挂钩以后，双方都很满意。这样每月可以为国家节省白布三千多米，并且大大降低了纸袋成本。
    北京市废旧物资回收部门决心继续当好生产后勤部，力争今年回收废旧物资比1959年的计划翻一番。
