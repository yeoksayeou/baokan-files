    Wholeheartedly for the Revolution
    ——An Interview with Veteran Vietnamese Labor Party Member Comrade Nguyen Li
    By Our Correspondent Hu Benying

    On the eve of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese Labor Party, this reporter interviewed Comrade Nguyen Li, a veteran revolutionary and a worker by origin, who has experienced thirty years of arduous struggle.

      Determined to Save the Motherland

    Comrade Nguyen Li was born into a family with a revolutionary tradition. His grandfather, Nguyen Huu Chao, was executed for participating in the patriotic anti-French movement of revolutionary Phan Dinh Phung and others, and all his family property was confiscated. His parents both worked in the Bien Thuy match factory, which was opened by the French. After his father died, the family became even poorer, and Nguyen Li was forced to work as a child laborer in this match factory at the age of eleven.

    Comrade Nguyen Li's mother was a hardworking and strong woman who often told her son stories about the fall of the motherland, the cruelty of the enemy, and the heroic struggles of revolutionaries. These stories deeply planted the seeds of patriotism in his young mind.

    July 14, 1927, was French National Day. At that time, Nguyen Li, who was in his twenties, was in Yi'an City. He saw French flags hanging everywhere in the streets and alleys. Nguyen Li walked down the street, wanting to find a Vietnamese flag among the forest of flags. When he couldn't find one, his heart was filled with distress and indignation. So, he asked a passerby, who looked at him with suspicion and said, "Don't you know that our country has already fallen!" These words pierced Nguyen Li's heart like a sharp knife, and he felt great pain.

    "Drive out the French," Nguyen Li was determined to devote himself to the cause of liberating the motherland. In that year, he joined the New Vietnam Revolutionary Party.

      Experiencing Severe Tests

    On January 6, 1930, the glorious Indochinese Communist Party was founded. From then on, the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle entered a new historical stage. The Party's program shone like a radiant lighthouse, illuminating the direction for the people to move forward. In this year, Nguyen Li was elected as the secretary of the Indochinese Communist Party branch of the Bien Thuy match factory, then as a member of the Bien Thuy District Party Committee, and then as a standing committee member and secretary of the Central Committee of Central Vietnam.

    In those turbulent days, Comrade Nguyen Li selflessly and tirelessly led and organized the workers and peasants in one struggle after another, and he was arrested several times in succession, suffering cruel torture at the hands of the enemy. But each time he was released from prison, he immediately threw himself back into the fiery struggle.

    In the spring of 1931, Comrade Nguyen Li was arrested by the enemy for the fourth time. This arrest was the most severe test in his life, because the enemy had learned from a traitor that he was a leading cadre of the Party. Sure enough, the enemy placed great hope in him, attempting to make him reveal the names of Party members who had not yet been arrested. During more than two months of continuous interrogation, the enemy used electric shocks, hanging, finger squeezing, bamboo sliver cutting and other cruel tortures, causing him to lose consciousness more than twenty times. However, the enemy's attempt to get anything out of him was in vain.

    One night, the sky was covered with dark clouds and the earth was pitch black. Taking advantage of the enemy's lax guard, Nguyen Li broke free from his handcuffs, pried open the roof tiles, and escaped from prison. He ran in one breath to the home of a Central Committee of Central Vietnam liaison officer, forty kilometers from the city. Thus, he found the Party organization again. However, before his wounds had healed, he was arrested by the enemy again. This time, the enemy brutally beat him continuously for more than four months, and his whole body was completely paralyzed.

    After failing to extract any confession from him through torture, the enemy sentenced him to death. Later, the sentence was changed to life imprisonment, and he was sent to Lao Bao Prison on the border between Laos and Vietnam. From 1932 to 1944, Nguyen Li spent his youth in this desolate prison. Here, he met Comrade To Huu, a member of the Party Central Committee.

    Fighting on the Anti-French Battlefield

    In March 1944, Japanese fascists kicked aside French imperialists and exclusively occupied Vietnam. Lao Bao Prison was in chaos. The prisoners took the opportunity to destroy the prison and escape. After Nguyen Li was released from prison, the Party sent him to Khanh Hoa Province in the south to be responsible for military work. In 1945, the Party seized power in Khanh Hoa Province.

    Nguyen Li, who had been tortured by the enemy until he was covered with scars, henceforth tightly grasped the weapons seized from the enemy and, like a wild horse freed from its reins, galloped across the battlefield, dealing the enemy a head-on blow.

    Nguyen Li was originally a worker, but after being responsible for military work, he became an excellent commander. Talking about this experience, Comrade Nguyen Li said humorously: "I should thank that sinful prison for understanding some military knowledge." It turned out that in Lao Bao Prison, Nguyen Li met a soldier who told him many military common sense and combat experiences. "Turning prison into a school," Nguyen Li, like many other revolutionaries, did this in the long prison life.

    In the autumn of 1945, not long after the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, French colonialists, with the assistance of British imperialism, came back. The flames of resistance to France ignited everywhere in southern Vietnam. In those days of bloody battles, Nguyen Li led his troops to fight in the Bien Hoa, Da Lat, and Kon Tum battlefields. Several times, the battle reached the point where only he and a few comrades-in-arms were left.

    Facing New Battles

    After the restoration of peace in Vietnam, Comrade Nguyen Li gathered from the south to the north. In order to build socialism in the north, the Party decided to establish its own machine industry and build a Hanoi machine factory with the latest equipment. Comrade Nguyen Li was assigned by the Party to be responsible for the construction of the factory and to serve as the factory director.

    This was a new battle task, and for a person with a lack of culture and advanced in age, the difficulties he would encounter were imaginable. However, after accepting the task, Nguyen Li did not hesitate at all and immediately plunged into the fiery construction upsurge.

    In the process of building the factory for more than two years, Comrade Nguyen Li always followed the teachings of the Party: relying on the masses of workers and learning from Soviet experts. At night, the construction site was quiet, and Nguyen Li lay in bed, but his heart was still on the construction site. When he thought of some chaotic situations in the work order, and he couldn't understand the experts' suggestions well, he couldn't fall asleep anyway. Sometimes, he was so tired that he drowsily fell asleep, but suddenly blueprints of the construction site appeared in front of him, and the crisscrossing lines made him dizzy. So, he woke up from his sleep again. Only after he found out or figured out the existing problems, and considered the work of the next day in an organized way, could he sleep peacefully. Day after day for two years, Comrade Nguyen Li's responsible spirit was deeply admired by everyone.

    In the spring of 1958, the Hanoi machine factory officially went into production. This was a major victory in the industrial construction of North Vietnam. In order to commend Comrade Nguyen Li's achievements, the Ministry of Industry awarded him a certificate of merit.

    In order to improve Comrade Nguyen Li's cultural and scientific level, the Party transferred him from his post last December to study full-time. When this reporter interviewed him at the Hanoi Cadre Cultural Refresher School, he repeatedly told the reporter that although he encountered many difficulties in his studies now, he was old but strong and determined to work with young people to conquer the cultural fortress.

    一片丹心为革命
    ——访越南劳动党老党员阮利同志
    本报记者　胡本英
    在越南劳动党建党三十周年的前夕，记者访问了一位经历三十年艰巨斗争的劳动党员、工人出身的老革命家——阮利同志。
      立志拯救祖国
    阮利同志生在一个有着革命传统的家庭里，祖父阮友照因为参加革命者潘庭冯等的爱国抗法运动被处死，所有家产全被没收。他的父母亲都在法国人开设的边水火柴厂做工，父亲死后，家境更加贫困，阮利在十一岁的时候也为生活所迫到这个火柴厂当童工。
    阮利同志的母亲是一位勤劳、坚强的妇女，常常向儿子讲述祖国沦亡、敌人的残暴和革命者英勇斗争的故事。这在他那幼小的心灵里，深深地埋下了爱国的种子。
    1927年7月14日是法国的国庆日。当时，二十多岁的阮利正在宜安市。他看到大街小巷挂满了法国国旗。阮利走在街上，想在悬挂的旗林里找到一面越南的国旗。当他找不到时，内心里充满了苦闷和愤懑。于是，他询问一位过路的人，那个人用疑惑的眼光看了看他，对他说：“难道你不知道我们已经亡国了吗！”这句话像一把尖刀一样刺痛了阮利的心，他感到极大的痛苦。
    “赶跑法国人”，阮利下定决心献身于祖国的解放事业。这一年他参加了新越革命党。
      经历严峻考验
    1930年1月6日，光荣的印度支那共产党宣告成立。从此，越南人民的革命斗争进入了一个新的历史阶段。党的纲领像一座光芒四射的灯塔照耀着人们前进的方向。这一年，阮利由边水火柴厂印度支那共产党支部书记被选为边水区党委委员，接着又被选为中圻党委常务委员和书记。
    在那些沸腾的日子里，阮利同志奋不顾身地、废寝忘食地领导、组织了工农群众一次又一次的斗争，而他也接连数次地被捕，受到敌人残酷的拷打。但他每次出狱后，立即又投入到火热的斗争里去。
    1931年春天，阮利同志第四次被敌人逮捕。这次被捕是他一生中最严峻的一次考验，因为敌人从叛徒的口里已经知道他是党的领导干部。果然，敌人对他寄托了很大希望，企图让他供出还没有被捕的党员。在连续两个多月的审讯中，敌人使用了电刑、吊打、夹手指、竹片割肉等各种酷刑，他昏厥不省人事达二十多次。可是，敌人想从他口里得到什么，却是枉费心机。
    一天夜里，天空阴云密布，大地漆黑一团，趁着敌人看管松懈的机会，阮利脱开手镣，扒开屋顶瓦片，逃出牢狱。他一口气跑到离城四十公里的一个中圻委员通讯员的家里。于是他又找到了党的组织。但是，当他的创伤还未痊愈的时候，他又被敌人逮捕了。这次，敌人连续把他毒打了四个多月，他的全身完全瘫痪了。
    敌人在对他拷打不出任何口供以后，就判处他死刑。后来又改为无期徒刑，把他送到老挝和越南边境的劳保监狱监禁。从1932年到1944年，在这漫长的十几年中，阮利就在这所周围荒无人烟的监狱里度过了自己的青春。在这里，他会见了党中央委员素友同志。
    转战抗法战场
    1944年3月间，日本法西斯踢开法国帝国主义独占了越南。劳保监狱一片混乱。囚犯们乘机捣毁监狱，逃了出来。阮利出狱后，党就派他到南部庆和省负责军事工作，1945年党夺取了庆和省政权。
    曾经被敌人折磨得遍体鳞伤的阮利，从此紧握着从敌人手中缴获的武器，像一匹脱缰骏马驰骋疆场，给予敌人迎头痛击。
    阮利原是一个工人，但他负责军事工作以后却又成了一个出色的指挥官。谈到这段经历时，阮利同志饶有风趣地说：“我懂得一些军事知识，倒应该感谢那罪恶的监狱。”原来，在劳保监狱的时候，阮利认识了一位军人，这个军人向阮利讲述了许多军事常识和作战经验。“变监狱为学校”，阮利同其他许许多多革命者，在长期的监狱生活中做到了这一点。
    1945年秋天，越南民主共和国诞生不久，法国殖民者在英帝国主义的协助下卷土重来。越南南部到处燃起了抗法的烽火。在那浴血苦战的日子里，阮利带领部队转战边和、大叻、昆嵩等战场。有几次曾经战到最后只剩下他和身边的几位战友。
    面临新的战斗
    越南和平恢复后，阮利同志从南方集结到北方。为了建成北方的社会主义，党决定建立自己的机器工业，兴建一所最新设备的河内机器厂，阮利同志被党指派负责建厂工作，并担任厂长。
    这是一项新的战斗任务，对于一个缺乏文化的、年龄又高的人来说，他将遇到的困难是可以想像的。但阮利接受任务后，没有丝毫的犹豫，立即投入了火一般的建设热潮。
    在两年多的建厂过程中，阮利同志始终不渝地遵循党的教导：依靠工人群众，向苏联专家学习。夜晚，工地一片宁静，阮利躺在床上，但心却还留在工地。当他想到工作秩序出现了某些混乱的情况、专家的建议自己还不能很好理解的时候，无论如何也不能入睡。有时，他实在太疲乏了，蒙蒙曨曨地瞌上了眼，可是忽然在他面前出现了工地图纸，那纵横交错的线条，弄得他眼花缭乱。于是，他又从睡梦中惊醒了。直到他把存在的问题找出或想通，把第二天的工作考虑得有了条理以后，他才安心地睡下去。两年如一日，阮利同志那认真负责的精神，深受大家的敬佩。
    1958年春天，河内机器厂正式投入生产了。这是越南北方工业建设上取得的一项重大胜利。为了表彰阮利同志的功绩，工业部颁发给他一张奖状。

    党为提高阮利同志的文化科学水平，从去年12月抽调他脱产学习。记者在河内干部文化进修学校访问他的时候，他一再向记者表示，现在虽然他在学习当中遇到许多困难，但他老当益壮，决心同青年一道攻克文化堡垒。
