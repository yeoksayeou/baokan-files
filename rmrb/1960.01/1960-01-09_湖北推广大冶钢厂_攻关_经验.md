Hubei Promotes Daye Steel Plant's "Tackling Key Problems" Experience

    The experience of Daye Steel Plant can be summarized in five characters: Investigate, Rank, Attack, Compete, Build. Investigate the critical points, rank the critical points, and determine the critical points. This means organizing the masses to discover and analyze contradictions, and grasp the main contradictions. Attack the critical points, organize technical performance competitions. This means mobilizing the masses, boldly innovating, and besieging the critical points. Build while attacking, summarize and promote advanced experience. This means conducting mass summaries, strengthening enterprise management, achieving consolidation and improvement, and preparing for the next battle.

    (Reported by this newspaper) The experience of Daye Steel Plant in organizing campaigns to tackle key problems has been promoted in many industrial and transportation enterprises in Hubei Province. A technical innovation and technical revolution movement focusing on key production aspects is vigorously developing in various enterprises.

    The experience of Daye Steel Plant in launching campaigns to tackle key problems is to, under the unified leadership and overall planning of the factory Party committee, seize the main key production aspects, mobilize the masses to boldly innovate, concentrate superior forces to besiege the key points, and drive overall work. It is a good method for enterprise leadership to achieve continuous leaps forward in production.

    The experience of Daye Steel Plant in organizing campaigns to tackle key problems was formed on the basis of learning and developing the experience of Daye Iron Mine. After Daye Steel Plant gave a preliminary introduction to this experience at the Hubei Provincial Industrial Production and Transportation Conference last November, many factories, mines, and transportation enterprises began to promote it. In mid-December last year, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee specifically held an on-site meeting to further summarize and promote this experience. At the meeting, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee required all industrial and mining enterprises in the province to quickly promote this experience, pushing the production increase and conservation movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution to a more comprehensive and deeper climax, achieving "three reds and five harvests" (i.e., a red start, a red house, and red to the end, ideological harvest, production harvest, learning harvest, good living, good hygiene), and realizing a comprehensive and sustained leap forward in 1960. In order to carry out the key problem-solving movement in depth, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee also required that in this movement, the experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works technical performance competition be earnestly promoted as an important form of the key problem-solving movement; a mass movement to study Ma Xueli's communist thought and bold innovation should be earnestly carried out to further improve the communist ideological awareness of employees. After this meeting, the promotion of the key problem-solving campaign experience has made new progress and is becoming increasingly effective.

    Industrial and mining enterprises in Huangshi City, where Daye Steel Plant is located, have already regarded it as a regular form of leading production movements. For example, Huaxin Cement Plant, through continuous tackling of key problems, has set off a wave of technical innovation and technical revolution, increasing the hourly output of cement kilns from 27 tons to 30 tons, basically solving the main key problems such as frequent temporary shutdowns of fine grinding. The daily output of cement increased from 2,400 tons to nearly 3,000 tons, completing last year's production plan in an all-round way ten days ahead of schedule. Throughout Huangshi City, due to continuous tackling and breaking through key problems, the city's total industrial output value completed the 1959 plan 48 days ahead of schedule. Fifteen major products, including steel, steel materials, pig iron, iron ore, cement, and coal, all completed their annual plans 25 to 10 days ahead of schedule. Major indicators such as product quality, cost, and labor productivity also completed the plan ahead of schedule, achieving a full year of production success. Many units in Wuhan City, such as Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant, have seen rapid changes in their production outlook after promoting Daye Steel Plant's experience. According to the experience of Daye Steel Plant, the Wuhan Textile Industry Bureau system, focusing on the main key to improving cotton yarn unit output, has continuously organized four battles since November 8 last year. In less than a month, the unit output of cotton yarn was increased from 32.02 kg to 35.64 kg, an increase that exceeded the increase in the past two years and five months. At the same time, the quality of cotton yarn was greatly improved, and the cost was greatly reduced, achieving an all-round leap forward. After transportation enterprises promoted the experience of key problem-solving campaigns, they also achieved significant results. After the Wuhan Railway Bureau organized the masses to tackle key problems, the punctuality rate of freight trains increased by 9.3% in five days, and the number of locomotive traffic accidents was reduced by half. Huangshi Port, focusing on the realization of port loading and unloading mechanization and semi-mechanization, organized three key problem-solving campaigns. Seventeen of the eighteen docks quickly realized mechanization and semi-mechanization, and the daily loading and unloading volume of the port increased from 4,000 to 5,000 tons to 10,000 to 12,000 tons.

### 湖北推广大冶钢厂“攻关”经验

    湖北推广大冶钢厂“攻关”经验
    大冶钢厂的经验归纳起来是五个字：查、排、攻、赛、建。查关键、排关键、定关键，就是组织群众发现矛盾分析矛盾，抓住主要矛盾；攻关键，组织技术表演赛，就是发动群众，大胆革新，围攻关键；边攻边建，总结推广先进经验，就是进行群众性的总结，加强企业管理，达到巩固提高的要求，并作好下一战役的准备工作。
    本报讯　大冶钢厂组织攻关战役的经验，已在湖北省许多工业、交通企业推广，围绕生产关键开展的技术革新和技术革命运动正在各企业蓬勃开展。
    大冶钢厂开展攻关战役的经验，就是在工厂党委的统一领导、全面规划的前提下，抓住主要生产关键，发动群众大胆革新，集中优势力量围攻关键，并带动全面工作。它是企业领导生产持续跃进的好方法。
    大冶钢厂组织攻关战役的经验，是在学习和发展大冶铁矿经验的基础上形成的。去年11月份，大冶钢厂把这一经验在湖北省工业生产交通运输会议上作了初步介绍以后，许多厂矿、交通企业就开始推广。去年12月中旬，中共湖北省委专门召开现场会议，进一步总结和推广了这一经验。会上，中共湖北省委要求全省各工矿企业迅速推广这一经验，把以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动推向更全面、更深入的高潮，做到“三红、五丰收”（即开门红、满堂红、红到底，思想丰收、生产丰收、学习丰收、搞好生活、搞好卫生），实现1960年的全面持续跃进。为了使攻关运动深入开展，中共湖北省委还要求在这一运动中，认真推广鞍钢技术表演赛的经验，把它作为攻关运动的重要形式；认真开展学习马学礼共产主义思想和大胆革新的群众运动，以进一步提高职工的共产主义思想觉悟。这次会后，攻关战役经验的推广工作有了新的进展，而且收效越来越大。
    大冶钢厂所在的黄石市的工矿企业已经把它当做领导生产运动的经常形式。例如，华新水泥厂通过不断攻关，掀起了技术革新和技术革命的热潮，使水泥窑的台时产量由二十七吨提高到三十吨，基本上解决了细磨临时停工多等主要关键问题，水泥日产量由二千四百吨提高到近三千吨，提前十天全面完成了去年的生产计划。整个黄石市，由于不断攻关破关，全市工业总产值提前四十八天完成了1959年计划；钢、钢材、生铁、铁矿石、水泥、煤炭等十五种主要产品都提前二十五天至十天完成年计划；产品质量、成本、劳动生产率等主要指标也都提前完成了计划，实现了全年生产满堂红。武汉市的武汉重型机床厂等许多单位，推广大冶钢厂的经验以后，生产面貌迅速发生了变化。武汉纺织工业管理局系统根据大冶钢厂的经验，围绕提高棉纱单位产量这一主要关键，从去年11月8日开始连续组织了四个战役，不到一个月就把棉纱单位产量由三十二点零二公斤提高到三十五点六四公斤，提高的幅度胜过过去两年零五个月提高的幅度，同时棉纱质量大大提高，成本大大降低，获得了全面跃进。交通运输企业推广攻关战役的经验以后，也收到显著效果。武汉铁路局组织群众攻关以后，五天就使货车运行正点率提高9．3％，机务行车事故减少了一半。黄石港围绕实现港口装卸机械化和半机械化，组织了三次攻关战役，十八个码头中有十七个很快实现了机械化和半机械化，港口每天的装卸量由四、五千吨提高到一万吨至一万二千吨。
