    Zhexi Power Station Speeds Up Dam Construction
    The construction of the Zhexi Hydropower Station in Hunan Province has entered the intense stage of concrete pouring for the dam. Thousands of builders are racing against the flood on the west bank of the Zi River day and night, determined to build the dam above the water surface before the flood season arrives this year.
    The Zhexi Hydropower Station's dam is being built in a mountain gorge. The dam is 104 meters high and 316 meters long, and is a modern hollow gravity dam. In the future, nine steel gate panels will be installed in the spillway section to block the Zi River water and drive the hydroelectric generators to generate powerful electricity.
    This hydropower station is the first large-scale water conservancy and hydropower hub project in Hunan Province. Accelerating the completion of this power station will have a significant impact on the development of the province's national economy.

    柘溪电站加紧筑坝
    湖南柘溪水电站建设已进入拦河大坝混凝土浇捣工程的紧张阶段。数千名建设者在资江西岸日夜与洪水赛跑，要在今年汛期到来前把大坝筑出水面。
    柘溪水电站拦河大坝建筑在山峡间，坝高一百零四米长三百一十六米，是一座现代化的空心重力坝。将来建成后，溢洪段将安装九扇钢板闸门，拦住资江河水，冲击水轮发电机发出强大的电力。
    这个水电站是湖南省第一个大型水利水电枢纽工程。加速建成这个电站，对于全省国民经济的发展将发生巨大作用。
