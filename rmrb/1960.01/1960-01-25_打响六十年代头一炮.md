    Firing the First Shot of the Sixties
    Xiao Peigen, Deputy Director of Fuzhou Sixth Machine Factory
    We warmly hail the successful completion of our country's Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, and celebrate the brilliant victory of the Great Leap Forward in 1959. This great achievement eloquently demonstrates the correctness of the Party's general line for socialist construction and displays the enormous power of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes.
    Our Fuzhou Sixth Machine Factory has developed from a metal hardware handicraft production cooperative. The equipment and technical strength were very poor. However, under the wise leadership of the Party and under the brilliant illumination of the general line, through self-reliance, from indigenous to foreign, from small to large, and from simple to complex renovation and expansion, production has greatly developed. In 1958, the total output value increased by 1.27 times compared to 1957, and in 1959, the total output value increased sharply by two times compared to 1958. In 1957, we could only manufacture small products such as copper locks, fire extinguishers, and faucets. Now, we can manufacture large pipe fittings, various industrial pumps, machine tools, and agricultural machinery. The cost of major products has decreased by an average of 56.26% compared to the beginning of 1959.
    We are determined to continue to leap forward at high speed this year and fire the first shot of the sixties. This year, we have already achieved a "good start." In the first twenty days, we completed 75.8% of the total monthly output value plan for January, a sharp increase of 86% compared to the same period last year. We must guard against arrogance and rashness, and strive to achieve a full victory and a red finish throughout the year.

    打响六十年代头一炮
    福州第六机器厂副厂长　萧培根
    我们热烈欢呼我国第二个五年计划提前三年胜利完成，欢庆1959年大跃进的辉煌胜利。这一伟大成就，雄辩地说明了党的社会主义建设总路线的英明正确，显示了大跃进、人民公社的巨大威力。
    我们福州第六机器厂是在五金手工业生产合作社的基础上发展起来的，设备和技术力量很差。但是在党的英明领导下，在总路线光辉的照耀下，经过自力更生、由土到洋、由小到大、由简到繁地进行改建扩建，生产有很大发展。1958年总产值比1957年跃增一点二七倍，1959年总产值又比1958年猛增两倍。1957年仅能制造铜锁、灭火机、水龙头等小型产品，现在已能制造大型管道配件、各种工业用泵、机床和农业机械等。主要产品的成本平均比1959年年初降低了56．26％。
    我们决心在今年继续高速度向前跃进，打响六十年代的第一炮。今年我们已经实现了“开门红”，头二十天完成了1月份全月产值计划75．8％，比去年同期猛增86％。我们要戒骄戒躁，为实现全年满堂红、红到底而努力。
