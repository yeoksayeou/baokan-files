(Dispatch from our Moscow correspondent) The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on January 2nd entitled "The Second Year of the Seven-Year Plan," looking forward to the new year. The editorial first pointed out that the great Soviet people greeted the new year of 1960 with sincere joy and pride in their lives and labor.
 
The editorial then said that last year would be recorded in the history of our country as a page of immortal glory and brilliant victories achieved by the Soviet people. The first year of the Seven-Year Plan demonstrated to the world that the magnificent program for the comprehensive construction of communism formulated by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is being successfully implemented, and that the Seven-Year Plan can not only be completed but also overfulfilled. In 1959, the economic power of the Soviet Union was further strengthened, the material well-being of our people was further improved, the fraternal cooperation of the socialist countries was further consolidated, and the international prestige of the Soviet state was also further enhanced.
 
When discussing the tasks for 1960, the editorial stated that in this newly arrived year, the Soviet people will accomplish truly great undertakings. As everyone knows, the 1960 plan stipulates higher production targets than those set in the Seven-Year Plan. This means that our country will adopt a higher speed than that stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan. Successfully fulfilling this year's tasks will lay a solid foundation for completing the entire Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In 1960, the Soviet Union will take a new giant step on the road to communism, on the road to completing the basic economic task—catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product production, and on this basis, catching up with the highest living standards in the world.
 
In the second year of the Seven-Year Plan, the total output value of our country's industry should increase by 8.1% according to the plan. This task is completely realistic, and it is believed that it will be overfulfilled.
 
The tasks facing heavy industry workers are particularly significant, as the priority development of heavy industry determines the speed and achievements of the entire national economy. One can judge the unprecedented heights to which our heavy industry has risen from the fact that steel production will reach 65 million tons in the second year of the Seven-Year Plan. In order to better understand the significance of this huge number, it is worth recalling that our country's steel production was only 4.2 million tons in 1928, and 18.3 million tons in 1940 before the war. How much has the power of our motherland grown since then!
 
The year that has arrived is a year for accelerating technological progress in all sectors of the national economy.
 
Soviet agricultural laborers are enthusiastically starting to implement the resolutions of the December Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee. This plenary session formulated specific measures to further improve agriculture. The total grain output in 1960 should reach approximately 9.3 billion poods. Meat production will increase to 10.6 million tons (net weight). The planned milk production is 72 million tons, which is 336 kilograms per capita, while the United States only reached 330 kilograms in 1958.
 
Our entire country is a huge new construction site. In the new year, the investment in capital construction will be 255.5 billion rubles. This is 1.8 times more than in 1950. Its characteristic is that 40% of all capital construction investment will be used for the development of the eastern regions.
 
All the union republics are extensively building new enterprises and carrying out huge work to expand and renovate existing factories. This embodies the Communist Party's Leninist national policy and tireless concern for the economic and cultural development of all union republics.
 
On the basis of the growth of industrial and agricultural production, the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people will be further improved. The total output value of light industry will increase by nearly 9 billion rubles in 1960. The plan for textiles is 7.9 billion meters, knitwear reaches 548.3 million pieces, and leather shoes reach 407.5 million pairs. Approximately 10 million people will move into comfortable new homes. In addition, collective farm members and rural intellectuals will build approximately 1 million houses this year. The real income of working people will increase. Employees in all sectors of the national economy will fully transition to a six- to seven-hour workday.
 
The editorial concluded by pointing out that the increasing number of tasks facing our country places higher demands on the Party, Soviet, and social organizations. In order to successfully complete the plan for the second year of the Seven-Year Plan, it is necessary to improve the level of leadership in economic and cultural construction, strengthen the organizational and political work of the masses, and resolutely eliminate shortcomings.
 
The creative labor of the Soviet people will bring fruitful results. Every worker, every collective farm member, and every intellectual in our country knows this, and therefore they are determined to achieve new production achievements in the year that has arrived. Throughout the country, a great national competition has begun to complete the plan for the second year of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In the course of the competition, the ranks of production innovators and advanced producers will expand, and the great movement of communist labor teams and shock workers will further develop.

    “真理报”社论说  苏联今年将迈出新的巨大的一步
    本报莫斯科电　苏联“真理报”2日以“七年计划的第二年”为题发表社论，展望新的一年。社论首先指出，伟大的苏联人民为自己的生活、劳动而怀着真诚喜悦和自豪的心情迎接了新的1960年。
    社论接着说，去年，将以苏联人民取得的不朽的光荣和辉煌的胜利的一页而载入我国史册。七年计划的第一年向全世界说明了，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会所制定的全面展开共产主义建设的宏伟纲领正顺利地实现着，七年计划不仅能完成，并能超额完成。在1959年，苏联的经济威力更加增强了，我国人民的物质福利更加提高了，各社会主义国家的兄弟般的合作更加巩固了，苏维埃国家的国际威望也更加提高了。
    社论在谈到1960年的任务时说，在新到来的这一年中，苏联人民将要完成真正伟大的事业。大家知道，1960年的计划规定了比七年计划所订的更高的生产任务。这就是说，我国要采取比七年计划规定的更高的速度。顺利实现这一年的任务，将为提前完成整个七年计划打下巩固基础。在1960年，苏联在向共产主义前进的道路上，在完成基本经济任务——在按人口平均计算的产品生产方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家，并在此基础上赶上世界最高的人民生活水平——的道路上，将迈出新的巨大的一步。
    在七年计划的第二年，我国工业总产量根据计划应当增长8．1％。这个任务是完全现实的，而且相信它将超额完成。
    重工业工作者所面临的任务是特别重大的，重工业的优先发展决定整个国民经济发展的速度和成就。我们的重工业上升到怎样空前的高度，可以从七年计划的第二年钢产量将达到六千五百万吨来判断。为了更好地了解这个巨大数字的意义，不妨回忆一下，我国在1928年钢产量仅为四百二十万吨，而在战前的1940年为一千八百三十万吨。从那时起我们祖国的威力是怎样增长了啊！
    已经到来的一年是加速国民经济各部门技术进步的一年。
    苏联农业劳动者正在欢欣鼓舞地开始执行苏共中央十二月全会的决议。这次全会制订了进一步提高农业的具体措施。1960年谷物总产量应达到九十三亿普特左右。肉类生产将增加到一千零六十万吨（净重）。计划的牛奶产量达七千二百万吨，按人口平均计算则为三百三十六公斤，而1958年美国才达到三百三十公斤。
    我们全国是一个巨大的新建筑工地。在新的一年里基本建设投资额为二千五百五十五亿卢布。这比1950年多一点八倍。其特点是，全部基本建设投资的40％将用于发展东部地区。
    所有的加盟共和国都在广泛建设新企业，并进行巨大的工作来扩建和改建现有的工厂。这里体现出共产党的列宁的民族政策和对各加盟共和国经济、文化发展的不倦关怀。
    在工农业生产增长的基础上，苏联人民的物质和文化生活水平将更加提高。轻工业生产总值在1960年将增加近九十亿卢布。纺织品计划达到七十九亿米，针织品达五亿四千八百三十万件，皮鞋达四亿零七百五十万双。约有一千万人将迁入舒适的新居。此外，集体农庄庄员和农村知识分子今年将建造约一百万幢住宅。劳动人民的实际收入将提高。国民经济各部门的职工将全部过渡到六至七小时工作日。
    社论最后指出，我国面临的日益增多的任务，向党、苏维埃和社会组织提出了更高的要求。为了顺利完成七年计划第二年的计划，必须提高对经济、文化建设的领导水平，必须加强群众的组织和政治工作，坚决消灭缺点。
    苏维埃人民的创造性劳动会带来丰硕的果实。我国每个工人、每个集体农庄庄员和知识分子都知道这一点，因而他们决心在已到来的一年中取得新的生产成就。在全国，已经开始了为提前完成七年计划第二年计划的伟大的全民竞赛。在竞赛的过程中间，生产革新者和先进生产者的队伍将扩大，共产主义劳动队和突击手的伟大运动将更加扩展。
