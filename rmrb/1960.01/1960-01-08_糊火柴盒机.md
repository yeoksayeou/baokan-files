    Matchbox Gluing Machine
    The Botou Match Factory in Hebei Province has independently developed a box gluing machine, which has increased efficiency fiftyfold compared to manual gluing. Previously, the box gluing process in this factory was entirely manual. Due to its low efficiency, it often affected production. Now, two-thirds of the outer boxes and one-third of the inner boxes are produced mechanically, effectively changing the situation where the gluing could not keep up with the overall production needs.

    糊火柴盒机
    河北省泊头火柴厂自力更生制成糊盒机，比人工糊盒提高效率五十倍。这个厂的糊盒工序原来全是手工操作。因为效率低，常常影响生产。现在有三分之二的外盒和三分之一的内盒实现了机械化生产，有效地改变了糊盒赶不上整个生产需要的局面。
