    Continuous Revolution, Constantly Striving Upward
    Chen Suzhi, National Advanced Producer, Beijing No. 2 Cotton Mill, Loom Operator

    Hearing the news that the Five-Year Plan was completed in two years, I was extremely excited. This is a great achievement made under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the General Line. It makes us even more confident in continuing the all-round Great Leap Forward.

    In 1959, the year of the continued Great Leap Forward, the spinning mill also achieved great victories. Our farmer brothers had a bumper cotton harvest, which brought favorable conditions to our factory. The whole factory launched a production increase and economy campaign to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward. The total output value completed the plan thirty-four days ahead of schedule, and cotton yarn production increased by 20.2% compared to the previous year. Many loom operators in Class C of our weaving workshop expanded from watching thirty-two looms to watching thirty-six and forty-eight looms, and created a new record of continuously producing no defective cloth.

    In the new year, I am determined to strictly demand myself according to the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, continuously improve my political, cultural, and technical level, further consolidate and improve my ability to watch the looms, and actively help other comrades improve their thinking and technology, and make a joint leap forward.

    不断革命　永争上游
    全国先进生产者北京国棉二厂挡车工  陈素芝
    听到五年计划两年完成的消息，我的心情非常激动，这是在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，所取得的伟大成绩，它使我们更加充满信心地继续全面跃进。
    在继续大跃进的1959年，纺纱厂也取得了很大胜利。农民兄弟棉花大丰收，给我们厂带来了有利条件。全厂掀起了比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进的增产节约运动，总产值提前三十四天完成了计划，棉纱产量比前年增长20．2％。我们织布车间丙班的许多挡车工，由原来看三十二台织布机扩大到看三十六台和四十八台，并且创造了连续不出次布的新纪录。
    在新的一年里，我要决心根据党的八届八中全会精神严格要求自己，认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，不断提高政治、文化和技术水平，进一步巩固和提高自己的看台能力，并且积极帮助其他同志提高思想，提高技术，共同跃进。
