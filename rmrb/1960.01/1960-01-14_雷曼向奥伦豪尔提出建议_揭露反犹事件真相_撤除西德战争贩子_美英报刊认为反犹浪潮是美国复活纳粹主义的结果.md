Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 12th - Max Reimann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, wrote a letter to Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer today, suggesting a personal meeting to exchange views on issues such as maintaining peace, preventing West German atomic armament, and various war, revanchist, and racial hatred propaganda. Recalling Hitler's seizure of power in 1933, Reimann pointed out in the letter that experience has shown that the result of anti-communism can only be the revival of fascism, militarism, revanchism, and racial hatred, and the increasingly difficult situation of the Social Democratic Party. He said that the Social Democratic Party should fight to abolish the ban on the Communist Party. Reimann suggested that Ollenhauer urge the West German Federal Parliament to hold a meeting to discuss the current anti-Semitic incidents, and to urge the parliament to establish a committee to expose the real causes, and insist on removing warmongers such as Strauss, Oberländer, Schröder, and Globke from their positions.

Reimann finally said that the entire working class must unite to demand that the two Germanys conclude a peace treaty, prevent the revival of West German militarism, and establish an all-German committee to formulate proposals for a peace treaty and measures to restore Germany's peaceful reunification.

Xinhua News Agency, January 13th - London Dispatch: Some American and British newspapers, commenting on the rampant anti-Semitic activities of fascists currently centered in West Germany, pointed out that this is the result of the revival of West German militarism and Nazism. Some newspapers specifically pointed out that the United States should be held responsible in this regard. The American "National Guardian" weekly published an article by Kumar Goshal on the 11th entitled "The Background of Anti-Semitic Atrocities." The article pointed out that Nazis are making a comeback in West Germany, and they are stirring up a racial hatred movement against Jews. Many observers link these events to the revival of West Germany's military and economic power. They believe that while the West was supporting Adenauer's Germany as the main force in the anti-communist crusade of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it was reviving the murderous flames of Hitler's Germany. The article said that the West, especially the United States' decision to allow West Germany to possess nuclear weapons, has allowed thorough anti-communist former Nazis to come to the fore in all aspects. Murderers are becoming officials, and many unreformed Nazis hold important positions in the Adenauer government, police force, and judiciary, and serve as teachers in schools. Former Nazi commanders are everywhere in the West German army. It is said that Field Marshal Erich von Manstein is very popular. Manstein was sentenced to eighteen years in prison for commanding the mass murder of Jews and ordering the burning of Polish villages. In addition, according to West German court rulings, 1,000 teachers (nearly 60%) who were previously dismissed for being Nazis have been reinstated.

Martin, a reporter for the British "Daily Mirror," specifically mentioned in a commentary on the 12th that West German authorities are "slowly and consciously poisoning German youth with a whole set of old Nazi doctrines." He wrote that West Germany's new nationalists, "disregarding the lessons of the previous war, and disregarding the fresh memories of the Nazis' massacre of millions of people, are not afraid of being punished, and openly educate children that Hitler was a great national activist." West German neo-Nazi youth organizations named after war criminals such as General Guderian and Admiral Dönitz still use Hitler's old slogans, such as "German racial superiority" and "Greater Germanic Reich," as mottos. Martin finally said that all of this is exactly the same as what happened during the Stormtroopers and SS period in the early 1930s. The current development of the political situation in West Germany is "completely along this path."

The London "Daily Herald" revealed that Adenauer's closest aide, Globke, "played a huge role in Hitler's formulation of anti-Jewish laws." The West German Foreign Ministry is full of officials who served under Hitler's Foreign Minister Ribbentrop.

    雷曼向奥伦豪尔提出建议
    揭露反犹事件真相　撤除西德战争贩子
    美英报刊认为反犹浪潮是美国复活纳粹主义的结果
    据新华社柏林12日电　德国共产党中央委员会第一书记马克斯·雷曼今天写信给社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔，建议同他举行个人会晤，就维护和平、阻止西德原子武装和各种战争的、复仇主义的以及种族仇恨的宣传等问题交换意见。雷曼在信中回顾了希特勒在1933年夺取政权的情况以后指出，经验表明，反共的结果只能是法西斯主义、军国主义、复仇主义和种族仇恨的复活以及社会民主党的处境日益困难。他说，社会民主党应当为争取取消对共产党的禁令而斗争。雷曼建议奥伦豪尔促使西德联邦议院举行会议来讨论目前所发生的反犹事件，并且促使议会成立一个委员会来揭露真正的原因，并坚持撤除战争贩子，如施特劳斯、奥勃兰德尔、施罗德、格罗布克之流的职务。
      雷曼最后说，整个工人阶级必须团结一致，以要求两个德国缔结和约，阻止西德军国主义复活，并且成立全德委员会拟定关于和约的建议和恢复德国的和平统一的措施。
      据新华社13日讯　伦敦消息：美国和英国的一些报刊在评论目前以西德为中心的法西斯分子反犹太人的猖獗活动时指出，这是西德军国主义和纳粹主义复活的结果。有的报纸还特别指出，美国在这方面应负责任。美国“国民前卫”周刊11日刊载了库马尔·戈夏尔的一篇题为“反犹暴行的背景”的文章，这篇文章指出，纳粹分子在西德卷土重来，他们正在掀起反犹太人的种族仇恨运动。许多观察家把这些事件同西德的军事力量和经济力量的复活联系起来看。他们认为，西方在把阿登纳德国扶植成为北大西洋公约组织反共十字军中的主力的同时，就使反苏的希特勒德国的凶焰死灰复燃。文章说，西方，特别是美国不惜使西德拥有核武器的决定，已经使彻头彻尾反共的前纳粹分子在各个方面出头露面了。杀人犯在当官，许多没有改造的纳粹分子在阿登纳政府中、警察部队中、司法机关中居要职，在学校中当教师。西德军队中，前纳粹指挥官比比皆是，据说，其中陆军元帅埃里希·冯·曼斯坦很吃香。曼斯坦由于指挥大批屠杀犹太人以及下令烧毁波兰村庄而被判处过十八年徒刑。此外，根据西德法庭判决，以前因为是纳粹分子而被撤职的教员中有一千人（将近60％）已经复职。
    英国的“每日镜报”记者马丁12日在一篇评论中特别谈到西德当局“以一整套旧纳粹制度教义来慢慢地有意识地毒害德国青年”。他写道，西德的新国家主义分子“不顾前次战争的教训，不顾人们对纳粹分子屠杀千千万万人记忆犹新，竟然不怕治罪，公开地教育孩子们说，希特勒是伟大的国家活动家”，以古德林将军、邓尼兹海军上将等等战犯的名字命名的西德新纳粹青年组织仍然以希特勒的老口号，如“德意志种族优越”，“德国人的大日耳曼”等作为座右铭。马丁最后说，所有这一切就跟三十年代初期冲锋队和党卫军时期发生的事情完全一样。目前西德政治形势的发展“完全是沿着这条道路”。
    伦敦“每日先驱报”揭露说，阿登纳的一个最亲密的助手格罗布克，“曾经在希特勒制订反犹太人法律时起过巨大作用”。西德外交部里充斥着希特勒的外交部长里宾特洛甫手下的官员。（附图片）
