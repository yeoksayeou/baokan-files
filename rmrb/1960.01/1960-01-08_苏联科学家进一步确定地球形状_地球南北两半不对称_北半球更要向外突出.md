Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 7th: Soviet scientists, based on observations of artificial satellite movements, have calculated the value for the Earth's flattening and determined that the two hemispheres are asymmetrical. The Earth's Northern Hemisphere protrudes outward more than the Southern Hemisphere.

This was announced by Jangveladze, an expert in the theory of celestial body motion, at a scientific conference held here.

Regarding the Earth's shape, it is generally known that it is a sphere slightly flattened at the poles. Before the advent of artificial satellites, geodesists from various countries had measured and calculated the Earth's flattening. In 1940, Soviet geodesists Krasovsky and others determined that the Earth's polar radius was smaller than the equatorial radius by 1/298.3. This value was more precise than the value commonly used by the scientific community in the past, determined by the American scientist Hayford (i.e., 1/297). This point was proven in 1958 by the value obtained from observing the movement of artificial satellites and has been recognized by scientists from various countries.

Now, Soviet scientists have not only derived a precise value for the Earth's flattening based on observations of artificial satellites but have also determined that the Earth's Northern Hemisphere is more prominent. In this way, people can more accurately understand the true shape of the Earth.

    苏联科学家进一步确定地球形状
    地球南北两半不对称  北半球更要向外突出
    新华社莫斯科7日电　苏联科学家根据对人造卫星运行情况的观测材料，已经求得关于地球扁圆率的数值，并确定两个半球是非对称的。地球北半球比南半球更要向外凸出一些。
    这是研究宇宙体运动理论的专家让格洛维奇在这里举行的科学会议上宣布的。
    关于地球的形状，人们都知道它是一个两极处稍微发扁的球体。在人造卫星出现以前，各国的测地学家曾对地球的扁圆率有过测量和计算。1940年，苏联测地学家克拉索夫斯基等测定地球极半径比赤道半径小二九八点三分之一。这个数值比过去科学界通用的美国科学家海福特所测定的数值（即二九七分之一）更为精确。这一点在1958年已经从根据观测人造卫星运行所求出的数值得到证明，并且得到各国科学家公认。
    现在苏联科学家不仅根据观测人造卫星得出了地球扁圆率的精确数值，而且确定，地球北半球更为凸出一些。这样，人们就可更为精确地了解地球的真实形状了。
