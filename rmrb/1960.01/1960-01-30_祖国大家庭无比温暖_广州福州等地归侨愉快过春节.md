Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Returned Overseas Chinese in Guangzhou, Fuzhou and other places are joyfully celebrating the Spring Festival in the warm big family of the motherland.

    The Overseas Chinese New Village in Guangzhou is filled with joyous scenes. On the first day of the Spring Festival, early in the morning, all the returned overseas Chinese and their families gathered in the library of the Overseas Chinese Primary School to joyfully hold a Spring Festival group greeting. After exchanging New Year's greetings, the entertainment program of the Spring Festival group greeting tea party began. A group of young women who grew up in Indonesia sang an Indonesian folk song, which evoked memories of a wandering life abroad among the returned overseas Chinese, making them feel particularly happy about today's happy life. Li Dezeng, a 72-year-old returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, and Huang Yuanbiao, another returned overseas Chinese, sang Hakka folk songs from their hometown of Meixian. When everyone heard Huang Yuanbiao singing in the folk song: "Good news is frequently reported for a good start, everyone is united in joy, everything presents a new atmosphere, everyone strives for a full house," they couldn't help but clap and cheer. He Zhuo, a 70-year-old man who recently returned to the motherland from Indonesia, lives in the first apartment building in the new village with his wife and three grandchildren. He can see his granddaughter, He Dongmei, who is studying at Guangdong Normal College, day and night. His grandson, He Guangyu, who is studying in Shanghai, also went south to spend the Spring Festival with his grandparents, younger siblings. The overseas Chinese who recently returned to China from Indonesia and were settled in the Changshan Overseas Chinese State Farm in Yunxiao County, received holiday allowances issued by the farm on New Year's Eve. Zheng Jinzhang, a new returned overseas Chinese who could not make ends meet in Indonesia, had his young children admitted to the nursery for free after arriving at the farm, and all four adults were assigned to work on the farm. On New Year's Eve, the family used the holiday allowance to buy meat and cook dishes, and happily celebrated the Spring Festival. After the reunion dinner, they were busy writing letters to their relatives overseas to report on their happy life after returning to China. The holiday activities of returned overseas Chinese students in various parts of Fujian are also unusually rich and colorful.

    In the Overseas Chinese New Village, beautifully located on the shore of West Lake in Fuzhou, the lights are bright and dazzling at night. On the first day of the new year, more than one hundred returned overseas Chinese and their families from Indonesia who live here were busy receiving guests. Yu Yumei, a relative of an overseas Chinese, held a wedding for her son, who is a primary school teacher in Changle County, before the festival, and her daughter, who is studying at the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, also returned home before the festival. Their family in China happily spent New Year's Eve. Before the festival, the service department of the Overseas Chinese New Village prepared a large number of holiday supplies and sumptuous dishes for the people.

    The returned overseas Chinese, their families, and returned overseas Chinese students in Nanning City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, held a Spring Festival get-together at noon on the first day of the new year. Li Jincai, a 67-year-old who recently returned to the motherland from Indonesia, also participated in this get-together. He worked hard overseas all his life, had six children and seventeen grandchildren. This time, he brought his old wife, youngest son and youngest daughter back to the motherland. His youngest son was introduced to work in an automobile repair shop two days before the Spring Festival.

    Returned overseas Chinese, their families, and returned overseas Chinese students in Shanghai have been holding grand Spring Festival gala evenings for several days. More than 1,400 returned overseas Chinese students from more than 70 universities and colleges held a get-together at the Youth Palace on the evening of the 26th. The famous film actress Zhang Ruifang congratulated the returned overseas Chinese students on behalf of Shanghai film workers at the meeting, and sang folk songs and film interludes.

    广西僮族自治区南宁市的归侨、侨眷和归侨学生在年初一中午举行了春节联欢会。新从印度尼西亚回到祖国的六十七岁的李进才，也参加了这个联欢会。他在海外辛苦一辈子，有了六个儿女和十七个孙子，这次他把他的老妻、小儿子和小女儿带回祖国。他的小儿子在春节前两天已经介绍到汽车修配厂工作。
