Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao - Following the widespread success across Shandong Province of Zibo Porcelain Factory's innovative experience of using gas to fire kilns, the Yangben Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Qingdao, Shandong Province, has successfully experimented with using gas to fire steam boilers, opening up a new way to save a significant amount of industrial coal.

The Yangben Dyeing and Weaving Factory's use of gas to burn boilers was developed based on the advanced experience of Zibo Porcelain Factory using gas to fire kilns. After Shandong Province held an on-site meeting in Zibo City last October on using gas to fire kilns, the Qingdao Textile Industry System immediately focused on the Yangben Dyeing and Weaving Factory to experiment with using gas to fire boilers. Through the efforts of the workers, gas generators and other devices were quickly built and successfully tested.

The first problem to solve when using gas to fire steam boilers is how to smoothly inject the gas into the furnace, and the second is to ensure that the gas entering the furnace can be fully burned while maintaining a normal temperature inside the furnace. The workers of Yangben Dyeing and Weaving Factory cleverly created a layered jacketed pipe. The interlayer transports gas, and the center of the pipe transports air, allowing the gas and air to be fully mixed in the hearth. They applied a thin layer of refractory bricks to the boiler steel plate to prevent the water in the boiler from cooling the burning gas, thereby ensuring that the temperature inside the furnace reaches about 1200 degrees Celsius, creating conditions for the gas to burn completely. They also installed a pressure regulating device at the air inlet to ensure stable furnace temperature. After more than half a month of testing, the boiler combustion was good, and the steam supply was normal.

According to the appraisal of relevant units in Qingdao, the Yangben Dyeing and Weaving Factory's use of gas to fire boilers has the following advantages: (1) It can save a large amount of coal. In the past, the factory used coal to directly burn boilers, with an average daily coal consumption of 9.9 tons; using gas to burn boilers, the average daily coal consumption is 4.945 tons, saving half the coal. (2) It greatly reduces the labor intensity of workers. In the past, when burning coal, workers had to shovel more than 1,400 shovels of coal per shift, each shovel weighing about 6 kilograms (including the weight of the shovel), resulting in high labor intensity. Especially in summer, the stoker sweats all day long, consuming a lot of physical strength. After burning gas, workers only need to look at the instruments and adjust the machines. (3) It fundamentally changes the situation of flying furnace ash and coal dust in the boiler room, and the working conditions of the stokers are greatly improved. (4) In the past, when burning coal, workers sometimes had to drill into the flue to dig ash, which was unsafe; after burning gas, this situation can be avoided. (5) The evaporation efficiency of the boiler is improved. In the past, when coal was directly burned in boilers, slag had to be removed once every one and a half hours, resulting in a large loss of heat energy. Opening and closing the furnace door when adding coal and hooking the furnace also caused some heat to escape with the waste gas. After burning gas, there is no need to add coal or remove slag, so the temperature is very normal, ensuring the stability of steam pressure. (6) When burning coal, an average of one and a half people were needed to watch one boiler; after using gas, an average of 1.1 people can watch one boiler.

Currently, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to promote this experience throughout the province. Enterprises in Beijing, Hebei, Shaanxi and other places have also sent people to study.

### 煤气烧锅炉　省煤又省劲  山东省委决定推广阳本染织厂的经验

    煤气烧锅炉　省煤又省劲
    山东省委决定推广阳本染织厂的经验
    据新华社青岛电　继淄博瓷厂利用煤气烧窑的革新经验在全省普遍开花之后，山东省青岛市的阳本染织厂又试验用煤气烧蒸汽锅炉成功，为大量节约工业用煤开辟出一条新的途径。
    阳本染织厂用煤气烧锅炉是在淄博瓷厂用煤气烧窑的先进经验上发展起来的。去年10月山东省在淄博市召开煤气烧窑现场会议以后，青岛市纺织工业系统立即以阳本染织厂为重点，试验用煤气烧锅炉。经过职工的努力，很快建成了煤气发生炉和其他的装置，并且试烧成功。
    用煤气烧蒸汽锅炉，首先要解决把煤气顺利喷入炉内的问题，其次要使进入炉内的煤气能够充分燃烧，同时保证炉内温度正常。阳本染织厂职工巧妙地制成了一种夹层套管，夹层内输送煤气，管子中心输送空气，使煤气和空气能在炉膛内充分混合。他们在锅炉钢板上贴上一层薄薄的耐火砖，不让锅炉中的水对燃烧的煤气起冷却作用，从而保证炉内温度达到一千二百度左右，给煤气充分燃烧创造了条件。他们还在进风口上安装了一个调节风压的装置，以确保炉温稳定。经过半个多月的试验，锅炉燃烧情况良好，供汽正常。
    根据青岛市有关单位鉴定，阳本染织厂用煤气烧锅炉具有以下优点：（一）能节约大量煤炭。这个厂过去用煤直接烧锅炉，平均每日耗煤九点九吨；利用煤气烧锅炉，平均每日耗煤四点九四五吨，省煤一半。（二）大大减轻工人的劳动强度。过去烧煤时，每班工人要投一千四百多锨煤，每锨约重六公斤（包括锨重），劳动强度很高。特别是夏季，司炉工更是终日挥汗如雨，体力消耗很大。烧煤气后，工人只要看看仪表，调整机器就行了。（三）根本改变了锅炉间炉灰煤粉飞扬的状况，司炉工人的工作条件大大改善。（四）过去烧煤，工人有时要钻入烟道内挖灰，不安全；烧煤气后，这种情况就可以避免。（五）锅炉的蒸发效率提高了。过去用煤直接烧锅炉，每隔一小时到一个半小时，就要扒渣一次，因而热能损失很大，投煤、钩炉时开关炉门，也有一部分热随废气跑掉。烧煤气后，不需要投煤、扒渣，所以温度十分正常，能保证蒸汽压力的稳定。（六）用煤烧锅炉时，平均一个半人看一口锅炉；用煤气后，平均一点一人就可以看一台锅炉。
    目前，中共山东省委已决定在全省推广这个经验。北京、河北、陕西等地的企业也曾派人来学习。
