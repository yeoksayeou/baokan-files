    Thoroughly Implement the General Line and Continuously Leap Forward
    Wu Jianhui, National Advanced Producer and Director of Liuzhou General Machinery Factory
    In this excellent springtime of the first year of the 1960s, the communique on the continued Great Leap Forward of the national economy in 1959 has arrived, greatly encouraging the workers and staff of our factory. In the past year, under the correct leadership of the Party, our factory has also achieved brilliant results in production. The total output value fulfilled 112.54% of the plan, an increase of 64.1% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.
    In this year, striving for an all-round bumper harvest of high yield, good quality, low consumption, and safety was our goal for implementing the General Line in production activities. According to the arrangements of the higher-level Party committee, we organized a series of production battles. The workers and staff successively put forward 11,500 major technical innovation proposals, most of which have been adopted. As a result, the overall appearance of the factory has been greatly changed, from 70% manual operation at the beginning of the year to 70% mechanized operation. With a 30% reduction in the number of workers and staff and 40% of the technicians being transferred to support new factories, we comprehensively completed the 1959 national production plan fifty-seven days ahead of schedule.
    Looking forward to the glorious prospects of socialist construction in the 1960s, we are full of confidence and hope. According to the requirements of the national plan for 1960, our leap forward plan is: to increase the total output value by 50% compared with 1959. We firmly believe that as long as we fully utilize and develop the experience of 1959, strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and vigorously carry out the technical innovation movement, victory will surely be ours.

    贯彻总路线不断跃进
    全国先进生产者、柳州通用机械厂厂长　伍坚辉
    在这六十年代第一个春天的大好时光里，传来了1959年国民经济继续大跃进的公报，我厂职工受到了极大的鼓舞。过去一年，在党的正确领导下，我厂生产也取得了辉煌的成绩，总产值完成计划112．54％、比大跃进的1958年增长了64．1％。
    这一年中，争取高产、优质、低耗、安全的全面大丰收，是我们在生产活动中贯彻总路线的目标。我们根据上级党委的布置，组织了一系列生产战斗。职工们接连提出一万一千五百件重大技术革新建议，绝大部分已被采纳。因此，全厂面貌大为改观，由年初的手工操作占70％改变为机械化操作占70％，在全厂职工减少30％，并有40％的技工调出支援新厂的情况下，提前五十七天全面完成了1959年国家生产计划。
    展望六十年代祖国社会主义建设光辉灿烂的前景，我们充满了信心和希望。1960年根据国家计划的要求，我们的跃进规划是：总产值比1959年增加50％。我们坚信，只要充分运用和发扬1959年的经验，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞技术革新运动，胜利就一定是我们的。
