    The Party Mobilizes the Creative Power of the Masses
    German Democratic Republic F. I. Heilmann
    In the German Democratic Republic, it is becoming increasingly clear that positive achievements will be made in the various stages of socialist construction up to 1965. On October 1, 1959, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic approved the Seven-Year Plan. The working class, under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist party, united in a solid moral and political unity with the peasants, intellectuals, and people of all other strata, and together with its government, began to prepare for the victory of socialism, in order to prove the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. The law on the Seven-Year Plan states: "Due to the existence of the people's power and the bold construction of socialism, it will surely prove that the German people can live a peaceful and happy life without atomic armament, without border demands, without revenge policies, and without militarists, monopoly capitalists, and big landlords." From this it can be seen that the German Democratic Republic is contributing to further changing the balance of power in the world in favor of socialism.
    During the ten years of the German Democratic Republic's existence, the thousands upon thousands of facts recorded in German history have shown that only socialism can provide social security and lasting happiness. In these ten years, the German Democratic Republic has become an internationally respected country, its industrial production having grown to three times that of 1936.
    The state's procurement of important agricultural products (socialist economic components in agriculture account for nearly 50% of the total farmland area) has increased by 1.7 times compared to 1949. As for handicraft production, it more than doubled in 1959 compared to 1949. Even Erhard, the Minister of Economic Affairs of the Bonn government, could not obliterate these achievements, so much so that he painfully admitted that the German Democratic Republic is fulfilling its Seven-Year Plan promises. The most important indicators of the Seven-Year Plan are: by 1965, industrial production will increase by 88% compared to 1958; labor productivity will increase by 85%; and national income will increase from 63 billion marks in 1958 to 100 billion marks in 1965. If the total value of goods supplied to residents in 1958 was 39.6 billion marks, it will reach 66 billion marks by 1965. Within seven years, real wages should increase by 60% to 65%, and working hours will be further reduced. Within seven years, 772,000 housing units will be built, which means that 2.5 million citizens can obtain sound housing conditions. This plan has received the full support of the people nationwide.
    The Socialist Unity Party of Germany basically proposed the draft of the Seven-Year Plan at its Fifth Congress in 1958. The Party pointed out a clear Marxist-Leninist direction for the masses, especially the working class. The Party did so by fully playing the kind of function that the poet Bertolt Brecht spoke of. He wrote: "What is the Party? The Party is us. You, me, and us, that is, everyone." The Party of the working class, based on the energy, experience, and abundant creative power of the working people, pointed out the goals of the Seven-Year Plan and the ways to achieve them. The slogan is: "Work, study, and live in a socialist way!" These short words show the great transformation process in the way of thinking and acting of millions of working people. They have abandoned the prejudices and bad habits of the old capitalist era and established new socialist relations. Thousands upon thousands of workers have united to fight for the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team." In the socialist work collectives, they work together with representatives of technical intellectuals, jointly develop the spirit of creativity and invention and inexhaustible initiative, strive to reach the world's scientific and technological level, and participate in solving world scientific and technological problems. This is one of the primary prerequisites for achieving the main economic task. This main economic task is to catch up with and surpass West Germany in the production and consumption of all important food and consumer goods per capita, thereby proving the superiority of socialism over capitalism in all areas of life.
    At the Fifth Congress of the Free German Trade Union Federation held in Berlin, Comrade Büchner from the Bitterfeld People's Enterprise Electrochemical United Factory emphasized: "Collective labor promotes open minds, pure hearts, and greatly increases the production of metal." As for pure hearts and open minds, the textile worker Imhard Lecht and many others from the Zittau Textile United Factory provided examples of genuine socialist consciousness and selfless comradely assistance to those who lagged behind. Imhard Lecht said: "If the West German militarists are allowed to realize atomic armament, or even launch a war, then what good is it for me to earn even half a mark more? In order for us, not them, to win in the competition, I took on the work of a lagging work team in the First Factory." After a short period, this work team, which was previously lagging behind, was able to consistently complete its plan.
    The Party of the working class attaches great importance to new people. In order to achieve the victory of socialism, they have found the key to how to work by helping others. The Party is summarizing the excellent experiences of the "Socialist Labor Team." In the development of the work team, Party members play an exemplary role. They walk in front of others and, in a Marxist-Leninist way, fight to fill every area of life with new socialist content.
    The task of the working class is also to establish a new socialist national culture along with the socialist social system. As a result of the completion of the Seven-Year Plan, our lives will be more prosperous and happy, and first of all, cultural life. The workers who participate in learning will largely become appreciators of new socialist literature and art works, and then creators.
    Last spring, at the Writers' Conference of the German Democratic Republic, with Comrade Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, in attendance, the slogan "Comrades, pick up your pens!" was put forward. At this meeting, Comrade Ulbricht spoke about the responsibility of the working class for establishing new German national literature, and discussed this according to the historical task that the most advanced class must personally master the destiny of the people. Since then, hundreds of thousands of workers have picked up their pens and begun to write their life histories and the history of their struggle for peace and socialism in literary form. The Party is helping them in this regard. Just like in other aspects, the Party is also an initiator here. The Party is conducting guidance and leadership, pointing out directions and goals. The Party is unswervingly mobilizing the masses and fighting for the socialist unity of the people.

    党在动员群众的创造力量
    德意志民主共和国  弗·伊·海尔曼
    在德意志民主共和国，人们越来越清楚，在到1965年为止的各个阶段的社会主义建设中将取得肯定的成就。1959年10月1日，德意志民主共和国人民议院批准了七年计划。工人阶级在马克思列宁主义政党领导下，同农民、知识分子和其他各阶层人民结成巩固的道义上和政治上的团结，同自己政府一道开始准备争取社会主义的胜利，以便证明社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性。在关于七年计划的法案中说道：“由于人民政权的存在和果敢地建设社会主义，定会证明德国人民可以在没有原子武装，没有边境要求，没有复仇政策，没有军国主义者、垄断资本家和大地主的情况下，过着和平、幸福的生活。”由此可见，德意志民主共和国在进一步改变全世界的力量对比，使之有利于社会主义方面，正在作出贡献。
    在德意志民主共和国存在的十年间，载入德国历史上的千千万万的各种事实说明，只有社会主义才能提供社会保障和永恒的幸福。在这十年里，德意志民主共和国变成了一个在国际上受尊重的国家，它的工业生产增长为1936年的三倍。
    国家对重要农产品的收购（在农业中社会主义经济成分几乎占整个农地面积的50％）比1949年增加了一点七倍。至于手工业生产，1959年则比1949年增加了一倍。甚至波恩政府的经济部长艾哈德也不能抹煞这些成就，以致十分痛苦地承认，德意志民主共和国正在执行它的七年计划诺言。七年计划的最重要指标是：到1965年，工业生产将比1958年增加88％；劳动生产率增加85％；国民收入从1958年六百三十亿马克增加到1965年的一千亿马克。如果说1958年向居民供应的商品总值为三百九十六亿马克，那末到1965年将达到六百六十亿马克。在七年内，实际工资应增加60％到65％，而工作时间将进一步缩减。七年内将建成七十七万二千幢住房，这就是说可以使二百五十万公民得到健全的住宅条件。这一计划得到了全国人民的完全拥护和支持。
    德国统一社会党在1958年第五次代表大会上就基本上提出了七年计划草案。党为人民群众首先是工人阶级指出了鲜明的马克思列宁主义方向。党这样做时完全是发挥像诗人贝·布莱希特所说的那种职能。他写道：“什么是党？党就是我们。你、我和我们，也就是大家。”工人阶级的党依据劳动人民的精力、经验、充沛的创造力量，指出了七年计划的目的及其实现的途径。口号是：“按社会主义的方式工作、学习和生活！”这些简短的话表明了千百万劳动人民思想和行动方式的大转变过程。他们抛弃了资本主义旧时代的偏见和陋习，建立了新的社会主义关系。成千上万的工人已经联合起来，共同为争取“社会主义劳动队”的光荣称号而斗争。他们在社会主义的工作集体中同技术知识分子的代表一道，共同发挥创造发明精神和永不枯竭的首创精神，争取达到世界科学技术水平，参予解决世界科学技术问题。这是实现主要经济任务的首要前提之一。这个主要经济任务就是：在所有重要的食品和消费品按人口平均的生产和消费方面赶上和超过西德，从而证明社会主义在生活的一切领域中对资本主义的优越性。
    在柏林召开的自由德国工会联合会第五次代表大会上，来自彼特菲尔德人民企业电气化学联合工厂的毕赫?尔同志强调指出：“集体劳动促使人们思想开朗、心地纯洁和大大增产了金属。”至于说到心地纯洁和思想开朗，来自人民企业齐道纺织联合工厂的纺织工伊姆哈尔德·莱希特及其他好多人都提供了真正的社会主义觉悟、大公无私的同志式地帮助落后者的榜样。伊姆哈尔德·莱希特说道：“如果西德军国主义者得以实现原子武装，甚至发动战争，那末我即使多挣半个马克又有什么好处呢？为了在竞赛中是我们而不是他们取胜，我在第一厂承担起一个落后工作队的工作。”经过短短的时间后，这个从前是落后的工作队就能够经常完成计划了。
    工人阶级的党十分重视新人。他们为了使社会主义取得胜利，通过帮助别人找到了应该怎样工作的钥匙。党在总结“社会主义劳动队”的优秀经验。在发展劳动队的工作中，党员起着模范作用。他们走在别人的前面，按马克思列宁主义的方式，为争取生活的各个领域充满新的社会主义内容而进行斗争。
    工人阶级的任务还要和社会主义社会制度一道树立社会主义的新的民族文化。七年计划完成的结果，我们的生活将更加繁荣幸福，而首先是文化生活。参加学习的工人将在很大程度上成为新的社会主义文学和艺术作品的欣赏者，然后则是创作者。
    去年春天，在德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希同志出席下，德意志民主共和国作家会议提出了这样的口号：“同志们，拿起笔来！”在这次会上，乌布利希同志讲到工人阶级对建立新的德国民族文学的责任，并且根据最先进的阶级必须亲自掌握人民命运的历史任务来论述了这一点。从那时起，成千成百的工人拿起了笔，开始以文学形式写出自己的生活历史和为争取和平和社会主义而斗争的历史。党在这方面对他们进行帮助。正如在其它方面一样，党在这里也是首创者。党在进行指导和领导，指出方向和目标。党不屈不挠地动员群众，并为争取人们的社会主义团结而进行斗争。
