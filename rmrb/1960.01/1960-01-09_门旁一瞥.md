    A Glimpse by the Door
    Zu Changfa

    I stood by the gate of the Wangzifen Motor Vehicle Depot, the roaring of engines echoing in my ears, as one new car after another drove past before my eyes. Towering scaffolding rose up again to the west, and another tall building was about to be born here.

    These buildings, ah! These factories, ah! Aroused my memories...

    How long ago was it that Wangzifen was not as it is now? I remember that in the early days of liberation, this was the only motor vehicle depot in Beijing, and it was not even a quarter of its current size. There were only a countable number of old cars, and they burned firewood. In the morning, despite the smoke, the workers prepared the vehicles to greet the dawn. In the only broken workshop inside the depot, a few old lathes were operating, and outside, all around, were barren graves and weeds...

    The First Five-Year Plan began, and the clarion call to build socialism sounded. The Wangzifen Motor Vehicle Depot changed day by day, and the speed of that change was truly beyond people's imagination!

    Bright factories, wide parking lots, clean canteens, tidy dormitories, scalding hot bathhouses; those broken walls and dilapidated ruins disappeared from our sight like fleeting clouds, but the impression they left on us is indelible. Replacing those firewood-burning cars were hundreds of brand-new "Pragues." In the morning, the whistle calls to dawn; in the evening, the engines report and praise new production achievements... How many changes, ah! How great a development, ah! It is difficult to write down all these impressions with a pen!

    Looking at the present, looking forward to the future, the golden and magnificent mansion of communism shines brightly!

    门旁一瞥
    祖长发
    我站在王子坟汽车场的大门旁，耳畔响着轰隆的马达，一辆辆崭新的汽车驶过我的眼前。参天的脚手架又在西边矗起，一座高楼又将在这里诞生。
    这一幢幢的楼房呵！这一片片的厂房呵！引起了我的回忆……
    曾几何时，王子坟场会有现在这样的面貌？记得，初解放时，这是北京市唯一的汽车场，面积没有现在的四分之一大，汽车是有数的十几辆破旧汽车，烧的是木柴。早晨，尽管烟雾弥漫，工人们迎着黎明整备车辆。场内仅有的一个破车间，几部老车床在那里操作着，场外周围是荒坟野草……。
    第一个五年计划开始了，建设社会主义的进军号吹响。王子坟场一天一天地改变着模样，那变化的速度呵真是超乎于人们的想像！
    明亮的厂房，宽广的停车场，清洁的食堂，整齐的宿舍，滚热的澡堂；那断垣颓壁像过眼的烟云一样，从我们的视野里消失，可是留给我们的印象是永不磨灭的。代替那木柴车的是上百辆崭新的“布拉格”。早晨，笛声呼唤着黎明；晚上，马达把新的生产成绩报颂……有多少变化呵！有多大的发展呵！用笔难写下这一切印象！
    看现在，望将来，那共产主义的金碧大厦闪闪发光！
