Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, Jan 17th dispatch: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an editorial on January 17 stating that Comrade Khrushchev's report on disarmament at the January session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the "Law on Another Substantial Reduction of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union" passed by the session, and the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries in the world have indeed shaken the world and shaken all continents. The Soviet people unanimously approve of the decisions of the session and sincerely thank the Communist Party, its Leninist Central Committee, and the Soviet government for their constant concern in consolidating peace and security. The editorial said that this new Soviet law is a peace-loving action of world significance. The working people of socialist countries, good people, and all those who care about safeguarding peace sincerely welcome the new Soviet peace initiative. The many reactions of international public opinion eloquently illustrate this.

The editorial stated that the Soviet Union and socialist countries do not intend to attack anyone. Aggressive intentions are completely irrelevant to them. However, their defensive strength is unprecedentedly strong. If any madman provokes an attack on the Soviet Union or other socialist countries, then we can simply eliminate the one or several countries that launch an attack on us from the earth.

The editorial concluded that the Soviet Union's unilateral disarmament action will have a huge impact on the international situation. The wise decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has aroused interest among peace advocates and given them hope: the upcoming summit meeting now has more chances of success, but it has caused unprecedented panic among those groups in the West who advocate the arms race.

This newspaper provides a comprehensive report. Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Soviet Union's proposal for unilateral disarmament put forward by Khrushchev at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the 14th continues to receive attention and welcome from public opinion in various countries around the world.

The Romanian "Spark" published an editorial on the 16th, saying that the Soviet government's decision not only has great practical significance but also great moral strength, providing a good example for Western countries.

The Albanian "People's Voice" published an editorial on the 15th, pointing out that the implementation of this extremely important measure is based on the spirit of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy and is based on the great development of its economic strength, the brilliant achievements of science and technology, and the further strengthening of the entire socialist camp.

The German Democratic Republic's "Neues Deutschland" editorial on the 16th stated that the disarmament proposal put forward by Comrade Khrushchev will receive support from all countries. Germany has a special responsibility to make a positive contribution to the realization of the disarmament proposal. The editorial believes that the Soviet Union's disarmament creates a more favorable atmosphere for the ten-nation disarmament committee meeting to be held in March and the summit meeting to be held in May.

The Mongolian "Truth Daily" published an editorial on the 16th, stating that the new peace initiative put forward by Comrade Khrushchev is a clear sign of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy, which fully conforms to the wishes of hundreds of millions of people. However, imperialism stubbornly conducts an arms race and poses a great threat to peace.

The Hungarian "People's Freedom Daily" published an editorial pointing out that Comrade Khrushchev's report at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union once again strongly warned Western politicians to recognize the reality. If the enemy dares to attack the Soviet Union and other socialist countries and drags mankind into the disaster of a new world war, then capitalism will suffer complete destruction.

Yoshitaro Hirano, chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, said in an interview published in the "Akahata" that the Soviet Union has demonstrated its peaceful policy through practical actions. Capitalist countries should also emulate it. He said that disarmament will be able to improve people's lives. Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, which goes against the general trend of the world and attempts to revise the "Security Treaty" and strengthen the Japan-U.S. military alliance, will become more isolated among the people from now on. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" published an editorial on the 15th, saying that despite various speculations about the Soviet Union's measure, the Soviet Union's guarantee to reduce 1.2 million armed personnel will positively influence the atmosphere of international disarmament.

The Lebanese "News Weekly" published an editorial on the 16th, saying, "The Soviet Union is determined to implement its proposal for complete and thorough disarmament. The Soviet government has taken the lead in taking measures in this direction, once again showing that the Soviet Union is as good as its word and is fully convinced that the cause of peace will triumph over war." The United Arab Republic's "Egyptian News" published an editorial on the 15th, saying that it is gratifying to hear that one of the four major powers is preparing to take the lead in disarmament. The newspaper welcomed Khrushchev's speech and his announcement to reduce the Soviet Union's current armed forces by another third, believing that this is in line with the current trend of maintaining peace. The "Ethiopian Herald" welcomed the Soviet government's decision to reduce its armed forces and hoped that this decision "will open the door to lasting peace."

The Cuban "Hoy" editorial published an article pointing out that if unilateral disarmament can save so much money, then how much money could be saved if the whole world completely banned atomic weapons and achieved comprehensive disarmament under necessary supervision? People all over the world, including the Cuban people, welcome the Soviet Union's decision. This kind of decision gives them increased hope for peace, for crushing the warmongers and aggressors of the Cold War, and the colonialists.

The Argentinian "Democracia" pointed out: "The Soviet Union has taken concrete steps in reducing its armed forces." "La Prensa" said that this is "an open challenge to the West, especially the United States." "La Razón" pointed out that this disarmament measure by the Soviet Union is another contribution to easing world tension.

The famous American financier and social figure Eaton warmly welcomed the Soviet Union's disarmament measures in a statement to the press. He emphasized that American national leaders and military leaders should seriously consider the Soviet Union's proposal for complete disarmament.

The Norwegian "Aftenposten" emphasized that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union called on all countries to follow the Soviet Union's example.

The Austrian "Kurier" believed in an editorial that the Soviet Union's decision to reduce its armed forces "creates the best climate for negotiations between East and West."

    各国舆论评苏联再次裁军建议的重大意义
    苏联对和缓国际局势作出新贡献
    西方政治家应该认清现实认真考虑苏联建议
    据新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”17日发表社论说，赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃1月会议上关于裁军问题的报告、会议所通过的“关于再次大量裁减苏联武装部队的法律”和苏联最高苏维埃致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书，确实震动了全世界，震动了各大洲。苏联人民一致赞同会议的决议，热诚感谢共产党、它的列宁主义中央委员会和苏联政府对巩固和平与安全的经常关怀。社论说，苏联的这个新法律是具有世界意义的、爱好和平的行动。社会主义阵营各国的劳动人民、善良的人们、所有关心维护和平的人莫不衷心欢迎苏联的新的和平倡议。各国舆论的许多反应雄辩地说明了这一点。
    社论说，苏联和社会主义各国不打算进攻任何人。侵略意图是跟它们毫不相干的。但是，它们的防御力量空前强大。如果有哪一个疯子挑起对苏联或者对其他社会主义国家的进攻，那么，我们就可以把向我们发动进攻的一国或数国干脆从地球上消灭掉。
    社论最后说，苏联单方面的裁军行动将对国际局势产生巨大的影响。苏联最高苏维埃的英明决定使和平拥护者感到兴趣，给予他们希望：即将举行的最高级会议现在有了更多的获得成功机会，但是，在西方那些鼓吹军备竞赛的集团中间，却引起了空前的惊慌失措。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：赫鲁晓夫14日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上提出的苏联单方面裁军的建议，继续受到世界各国舆论的重视和欢迎。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”16日发表编辑部文章说，苏联政府的这个决定不仅具有巨大的实际意义，而且具有伟大的道义力量，对西方国家来说，是一个良好的榜样。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”15日发表社论指出，实施这一极其重要的措施是依据苏联的和平政策的精神，是根据它的经济力量的巨大发展和科学技术的光辉成就，以及整个社会主义阵营的进一步加强。
    德意志民主共和国的“新德意志报”16日的社论说，赫鲁晓夫同志提出的裁军建议将得到各国的支持。德国特别有责任作出积极的贡献，以使裁军建议得到实现。社论认为，苏联的这次裁军为将在3月间举行的十国裁军委员会会议和5月间举行的最高级会议创造更有利的气氛。
    蒙古“真理报”16日发表社论说，赫鲁晓夫同志提出的新的和平倡议，是苏联和平政策的鲜明标志，它完全符合亿万人民的愿望。但是，帝国主义却顽固地进行军备竞赛并给和平带来了很大威胁。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”发表社论指出，赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的报告，又一次有力地警告西方政治家们要认清现实情况。如果敌人胆敢进攻苏联和其他社会主义国家，把人类拖入新的世界大战的灾祸中去，那么，资本主义将遭受全部的毁灭。
    日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎在“赤旗报”上发表谈话说，苏联通过实际行动表现了它的和平政策。资本主义国家也应该仿效它这样做。他说，裁军将能够改善人民生活。日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章指出，与世界大势背道而驰、企图修改“安全条约”和加强日美军事同盟的岸信介内阁从此将在人民中更加孤立。“读卖新闻”15日发表的社论说，尽管对苏联的这个措施有各种推测，苏联保证削减一百二十万武装人员这个措施将对国际性裁军的气氛给予肯定的影响。
    黎巴嫩“消息周报”16日发表社论说，“苏联决心实现它的关于全面彻底裁军的建议。苏联政府朝着这个方向率先采取了措施，再一次表明苏联是说到做到，它完全坚信不疑，和平事业必将制胜战争。”阿联“埃及新闻报”15日发表的社论说，听到四大国中有一国准备带头裁军，那是令人高兴的事。这家报纸表示欢迎赫鲁晓夫的讲话和他宣布把苏联目前的武装部队再削减三分之一的决定，认为这是符合目前维持和平的趋势的。“埃塞俄比亚先驱报”表示欢迎苏联政府裁减武装部队的决定，并希望这个决定“将为持久和平打开大门。”
    古巴“今日报”编辑部发表文章指出，如果单方面裁军能够省下这样多的资金，那么全世界都彻底禁止原子武器和实现全面的、在必要的监督下的裁军，那该省下多少资金呢？全世界人民，其中包括古巴人民，欢迎苏联的决定。这种决定给他们增加了对和平、对粉碎冷战鼓吹者和侵略者以及殖民主义者的希望。
    阿根廷“民主报”指出：“苏联在裁减自己武装部队方面作出了具体步骤”。“新闻报”说，这是“对西方，首先是对美国的公开挑战”。“评论报”指出，苏联这一裁军措施是对缓和世界紧张局势的又一贡献。
    美国著名金融家和社会人士伊顿在向报界发表的声明中热烈欢迎苏联的裁军措施。他强调美国国家领导人和军界领袖应该认真考虑苏联的彻底裁军建议。
    挪威“晚邮报”着重指出，苏联最高苏维埃呼吁各国效仿苏联的榜样。
    奥地利“信使报”在社论中认为，苏联裁减武装部队的决定“为东西方的谈判创造了最好的气候”。
