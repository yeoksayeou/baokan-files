Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The "Ants Gnawing at a Bone" experience created by Chinese mechanical industry workers has been widely promoted throughout the national mechanical industry. In 1959, it played a significant role in the manufacturing of large-scale equipment and has been further developed.

The "Ants Gnawing at a Bone" method is of great significance for solving the problem of insufficient processing capacity for large components in the mechanical industry. It greatly improved the ability of medium and small-sized machinery factories to manufacture large-scale equipment. The ability to manufacture many sets of large rolling mills last year was due to the adoption of the "Ants Gnawing at a Bone" method by most factories undertaking the rolling mill manufacturing tasks. The two 2,500-ton forging hydraulic presses manufactured in Beijing and Tianjin were also mainly made using the "Ants Gnawing at a Bone" method. While modern large-scale machinery factories are leveraging the potential of large equipment, they are also widely adopting the "Ants Gnawing at a Bone" method to supplement the insufficient processing capacity of large equipment.

After more than a year of practice, many enterprises have enriched and developed this experience, transforming "Ants Gnawing at a Bone" into setting up a large "Ants Array." "Ants Gnawing at a Bone" involves using one or several specialized small machine tools to simultaneously process a certain process of a large component; while setting up a large "Ants Array" involves many different types of small equipment, in groups, simultaneously processing different processes of a large component, so that the component basically becomes a finished product after one processing. This greatly reduces production auxiliary time and shortens the production cycle. For example, when the heavy workshop of Shenyang Northeast Machinery Factory was processing the twelve-ton steam hammer arm component, it was initially decided to use the "Ants Gnawing at a Bone" method, completing one process before completing another, which would take thirty to forty days to complete; later, after repeated research by veteran workers, an "Ants Array" composed of many different types of machine tools was adopted to process six processes simultaneously, and as a result, the component was made in only fourteen days, and when processing the second identical component, it only took ten days to complete the task. In addition, the "Ants" used by many enterprises have also been changed from specialized to general-purpose, from manual feed to automatic feed, and from single-blade cutting to multi-blade cutting, thereby further improving the processing adaptability and work efficiency of this method.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 9th: Nanchang Agricultural Machinery Factory used the "Ants Gnawing at a Bone" method to produce a twenty-ton ball mill and a 1,000-kilowatt turbine.

This factory was established in 1958, without engineers and with relatively simple equipment, mostly belt-driven old lathes. The main products over the years were oxcart disks, threshing machines, and gas generators, and the maximum product weight did not exceed one ton. Last year, the leadership department required the factory to manufacture eight ball mills with an annual output of 32,000 tons of cement and 1,000-kilowatt turbines and other products. After the task was assigned, under the leadership of the factory's Party committee, the factory adopted the method of "three combinations" of leading cadres, workers, and technicians, and within more than a month, it manufactured large six-meter gantry planers, two-meter vertical lathes, three-meter floor lathes, and five-ton cranes and other processing equipment, arming itself.

At the same time, the factory leaders mobilized the workers to use the "Ants Gnawing at a Bone" method to enable small machine tools to do big jobs, calling on everyone to think of ways and come up with ideas. According to the component processing requirements of the ball mill, the metalworking workshop, after discussion and research, made some large components rotate, and then used small machine tools to cut next to it. After adopting this method at the beginning, the processing cycle was very long, and it took more than a month to process a ball mill cylinder. Therefore, the workers transformed the lathe into a small tool holder, so that it could both turn and drill holes, thus shortening the processing cycle by half. When processing the large gear of the ball mill, they used the factory's cement pillars as the machine body's vertical wall, used the old turbine rod as the transmission equipment, installed a native milling cutter on the rod shaft, placed the workpiece flat on the ground, marked the lines, divided the degrees, and milled one tooth at a time, and as a result, they quickly completed the gear processing of eight ball mills.

This factory has already formed a complete system for processing large components such as casting, forging, riveting, turning, planing, milling, boring, drilling, and hoisting in the entire factory, laying the foundation for manufacturing large products in the future. (Attached picture)

    “蚂蚁啃骨头”方法的新发展
    中小机械厂大摆“蚂蚁阵”
    许多不同的小型设备同时对一个大部件的各个工序进行加工
    新华社9日讯　我国机械工业职工创造的“蚂蚁啃骨头”的经验，已在全国机械工业中普遍推广。1959年，它在大型设备的制造方面起了重大作用，而且又有了进一步的发展。
    “蚂蚁啃骨头”的方法，对于解决机械土业中大部件加工能力不足的问题有重要意义。它大大提高了中、小型机械厂制造大型设备的能力。去年能够制造出许多套大型轧钢机，就是由于大多数承担轧机制造任务的工厂，采用了“蚂蚁啃骨头”的方法。北京、天津两市制造的两台二千五百吨的锻造水压机，主要也是采用了“蚂蚁啃骨头”的方法。现代化大型机械厂在发挥大设备潜力的同时，也广泛采用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的方法，补充大设备加工能力的不足。
    经过一年多的实践，不少企业又丰富和发展了这一经验，由“蚂蚁啃骨头”变为大摆“蚂蚁阵”。“蚂蚁啃骨头”，是用一台或几台专用小型机床同时对一个大部件的某一道工序进行加工；而大摆“蚂蚁阵”，则是许多不同类型的小型设备，成群结队地同时对一个大部件的不同工序进行加工，使部件经过一次加工基本上成为成品。这样，就大大减少了生产辅助时间，缩短了生产周期。例如沈阳东北机器厂重型车间在加工十二吨重的汽锤臂部件时，开始决定用“蚂蚁啃骨头”方法，完成一道工序再完成另一道工序，这样需要三十天到四十天的时间才能完成；后来经过老工人反复研究，采用许多不同类型的机床组成“蚂蚁阵”，同时对六道工序进行加工，结果只用了十四天就把这个部件做成了，而且在加工第二个同样的部件时，只用十天就完成了任务。此外，许多企业使用的“蚂蚁”，也由专用改为通用，由手工进刀改为自动进刀，由单刀切削改为多刀切削，从而更加提高了这种方法的加工适应性和工作效率。
    新华社南昌9日电　南昌市农业机械厂采用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的方法制出了二十吨重的球磨机和一千瓩的水轮机。
    这个厂是1958年建立起来的，没有工程师，设备也比较简陋，大部分是皮带式的旧车床，历年来主要产品是牛车盘、打谷机和煤气机，最大产品重量也不超过一吨。去年，领导部门要求这个厂制造八台年产三万二千吨水泥的球磨机和一千瓩水轮机等产品。任务下达后，这个厂在工厂党委的领导下，采取领导干部、工人和技术人员“三结合”的办法，在一个多月的时间内，就制成了六米大型龙门刨床、二米立式车床、三米落地车床和五吨吊车等加工设备，武装了自己。
    与此同时，厂领导上又发动职工用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，使小机床干大活，号召人人想办法，出主意。金工车间根据球磨机的部件加工要求，经过讨论研究，使一些大型部件自转，然后在它旁边用小机床切削。开始采用这个办法以后，加工周期很长，一个球磨机筒体要用一个多月时间。于是，工人又把车床改装成小刀架，做到既能车又能钻眼，因而使加工周期缩短了一半。在加工球磨机的大牙轮时，他们利用厂房水泥柱子当机身立壁，利用旧涡轮杆作传动设备，在杆轴上装一把土铣刀，把工作物平放在地上，划好线，分好度数，一牙一牙地铣，结果很快完成了八台球磨机的牙轮加工。
    这个厂已经在全厂组成了一个铸、锻、铆、车、刨、铣、搪、钻、吊等大型部件加工的完整系统，为今后制造大型产品打下了基础。（附图片）
