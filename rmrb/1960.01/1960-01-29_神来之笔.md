    Inspired Pen

    The New Year of 1960 brings us the greatest good news: the Second Five-Year Plan was victoriously completed three years ahead of schedule.
    When we see those inspiring figures: 13.35 million tons of steel, 347.88 million tons of coal, 540.1 billion jin of grain, and 48.2 million dan of cotton, how can we not feel our "hearts surging high with the waves"?
    We see the numbers, but even more, we see the people who created these numbers.
    People act under the guidance of certain ideas. What is the dominant ideology today? It is the proletarian ideology, the communist ideology, and the resulting communist style and communist soaring spirit:
    A call goes out for steel. Tens of millions of people go up the mountains, find the ore, build the blast furnaces, and the red light flashes, the molten iron flows. When it is said that indigenous blast furnaces need to be developed and improved, "small, indigenous, and mass" immediately transforms into "small, modern, and mass"...
    A call goes out for water. Tens of millions of people are engaged in water conservancy projects, diverting water from the south to the north, clarifying the Yellow River, and drawing water from the river up to the high mountains. Water from the mountains flows into reservoirs, and water is ordered to generate electricity, to irrigate, and to carry boats. Fresh fish and ducks, the old residences are not enough, leading the aquatic creatures to move to a new and vast world. How much poetry and artistry is in this?!
    A call goes out for transportation, and then trains, cars, ships, animal-drawn carts, handcarts, sailboats, ice sleds, etc., all go into action together. Thus, bamboo is used to make boats, iron shoes are nailed onto the hooves of oxen, going south and north, bustling and lively.
    On a blank sheet of paper, 600 million Yaos and Shuns wield pens as large as beams, writing and painting freely on it. A new and beautiful picture is gradually unfolding before the world's audience, making the enemy tremble, making friends cheer, and filling us, the more than 600 million painters, with national pride and class pride.
    Wasn't there a magic brush Ma Liang? The ox he painted could plow the fields, the house he painted could be lived in, and the boat he painted could sail. From this magical story, people's rational desires are reflected: the need for productive tools, the need for abundant material wealth, and the need to change their poor situation.
    Fantasy has become reality. The general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism is a magic pen, and once it is grasped by the people of the whole country, then there will be steel if steel is needed, coal if coal is needed, grain if grain is needed, cotton if cotton is needed... socialism if socialism is needed, and communism, communism is coming towards us!
    We are walking on the socialist journey, and the mast of the communist ship has already appeared on the horizon. Let us clap our hands in welcome and rush forward!

    神来之笔
    马铁丁
    1960年的新春，为我们带来一个最大的喜讯：第二个五年计划提前三年胜利完成了。
    当我们看到那些振奋人心的数字：钢一千三百三十五万吨，煤三亿四千七百八十万吨，粮五千四百零一亿斤，棉四千八百二十万担的时候，我们怎能不“心潮逐浪高”？
    我们看到数字，更看到创造这些数字的人。
    人，是在一定的思想支配下行动的。当前占统治地位的思想是什么？是无产阶级的思想，是共产主义的思想，以及由此而来的共产主义风格、共产主义冲天干劲：
    说一声要钢铁。几千万人上山，把矿石找到了，把高炉建立起来了，红光闪闪，铁水奔流。说土高炉需要发展提高，“小”“土”“群”立即向“小”“洋”“群”转化……。
    说一声要水。几千万人兴修水利，要南水北调，要黄河沉清，河里水引上高山。山上水流入水库，命令水发电，命令水灌溉，命令水载舟。鲜鱼水鸭，老住宅不够用了，率领着水族们向新的广阔的天地搬家。这里面，该有多少诗情画意？！
    说一声要搞运输，于是火车、汽车、轮船、畜力车、人力车、帆船、冰撬等等，一齐上阵。于是，竹子造成了船，牛蹄上钉上铁掌，南来北去，熙熙攘攘。
    一张白纸，六亿尧舜提起如椽之笔，在上面纵横挥毫。一幅又新又美的画，逐步展开在世界观众之前，使敌人丧胆，使朋友喝采，使我们这六亿多的画家们充满着民族自豪感、阶级自豪感。
    不是有个神笔马良吗？画牛牛能耕田，画房子房子可住人，画船船可以航行。从这神奇的故事里，反映出人们合理的愿望：要求有生产工具，要求有丰厚的物质财富，要求改变自己穷困的处境。
    幻想变成了现实。鼓足干劲、力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线这支神笔，一经全国人民掌握，那么，要钢有钢，要煤有煤，要粮食有粮食，要棉花有棉花……要社会主义有社会主义，要共产主义，共产主义向我们迎面走来！
    我们走在社会主义的旅途中，而共产主义航轮的航桅已经露出地平线了，让我们拍掌欢迎，奔上前去吧！
