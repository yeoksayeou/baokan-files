Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: For the past half-month, the broad area of China south of central Inner Mongolia and north of the Yangtze River, which has seen basically no rain or snow, has experienced snowfall from north to south starting on the 14th. The area affected by this snowfall is similar to that of mid-December last year. Simultaneously, widespread areas in the Yangtze River basin also experienced rain.

The areas experiencing snowfall include central Inner Mongolia, most of Ningxia, parts of Gansu, all of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, southern Liaoning, northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, and the mountainous areas of northern Hubei. Among these, the snowfall in most of Henan and Shandong, northern Hebei, northern Anhui, and northern Hubei was heavier than in other areas. Eastern Sichuan and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River experienced light to moderate rain, with slightly heavier rainfall in central Hunan, central Jiangxi, and southern Anhui. As of 8:00 PM on the 15th, the snow in the vast area south of the North China Plain and the rain in the south were still falling. According to meteorological forecasts, the cold air will continue southward, and there will be rain near the Nanling Mountains as well.

This snowfall and rainfall are extremely beneficial for overwintering crops and the upcoming spring plowing. However, all localities should also pay attention to accumulating snow and storing water to prevent spring drought.

    北方瑞雪　南方喜雨
    各地要加紧积雪蓄水，预防春早，迎接春耕
    新华社15日讯　半个月来基本没有下雨下雪的我国内蒙古中部以南、长江以北广大地区，14日起从北向南相继下雪。这次下雪的地区同去年12月中旬那一次差不多。同时，长江流域广大地区也下了雨。
    这次下雪的地区，包括内蒙古中部地区，宁夏大部地区，甘肃部分地区，陕西、山西、河北、山东、河南全省，辽宁南部，安徽北部，江苏北部和湖北北部山区。其中河南、山东大部、河北北部、安徽北部和湖北北部的雪较其他地区下得大。四川东部和长江流域中下游各省下的是小雨或中雨，其中湖南中部、江西中部、安徽南部的降雨量稍大。到15日晚8时，华北平原以南广大地区的雪和南方的雨都还在下。据气象部门预报，冷空气继续南下，南岭附近也将有雨。
    这次下雪下雨，对越冬作物和即将到来的春耕都有极大好处。但是各地还要注意积雪蓄水，以防春旱。
