    More Benefits Come from Door-to-Door Service
    Qin Li
    Next to the bus stop on East Chang'an Street in Beijing, the Xinhua Bookstore held a small street New Year picture exhibition. Almost everyone passing by or waiting for the bus was attracted by these New Year pictures that sing praises of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. New Year pictures are the most popular decorations for the broad masses of working people in our country to welcome the New Year. Exhibiting New Year pictures on the street allows more people to receive a vivid socialist education, and also gives people who like New Year pictures an opportunity to choose when purchasing them.
    Some time ago, a comrade told me that he went to the Central Cinema to see a movie. As soon as he entered, he saw a young man sitting on the stage playing the piano. He thought he had gone to the wrong place and was about to turn around and leave, but the attendant quickly and gently told him that this was a program added by teachers and students from the Central Conservatory of Music, and the person playing on the stage was the young pianist Liu Shikun, who had won several international piano competition awards. This comrade said that he rarely goes to concerts normally. This time, he watched a movie and listened to music, which was not only killing two birds with one stone, but also aroused his interest in listening to music.
    These are just two examples of artists going deep into the masses and providing door-to-door service since the Great Leap Forward, but they also illustrate the benefits of this approach and its popularity with the masses. For the needs of the masses, we hope that artists will deliver services to the door in more ways!

    送上门的好处多
    秦犁
    在北京东长安街的公共汽车站旁边，新华书店举办了一个小型的街头年画展览，凡是过路或者等车的人，差不多都被这些歌颂总路线、歌颂大跃进、歌颂人民公社的新年画所吸引了。年画是我国广大劳动人民迎接新春最喜爱的装饰品，把新年画送上街头展览，使更多的人受到了一次生动的社会主义教育，也让爱好年画的人，在购买时能得到一个挑选的机会。
    前些时，有一个同志告诉我，他到中央电影院去看电影，一入场，只见一个青年人坐在台上弹钢琴，他以为自己走错了地方，正准备转身退出来，服务员连忙轻轻地对他说，这是中央音乐学院师生来加演的节目，台上那个演奏的人是几次获得国际钢琴比赛奖的青年钢琴家刘诗昆。这位同志说，他平时很少去音乐会，这一次看了电影又听了音乐，不但一举两得，还引起了他听音乐的兴趣。
    这里仅仅是大跃进以来艺术工作者深入群众，送上门去的两个例子，却也说明了这种做法的好处和群众的欢迎。为了群众的需要，我们希望艺术工作者通过更多的方式送上门去！
