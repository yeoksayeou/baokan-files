Xinhua News Agency, London, January 13th: The British Iron and Steel Board announced tonight that Britain's total steel production in 1959 was 20.2 million tons. This output was 1.5 million tons less than in 1957; although it increased compared to the crisis-stricken 1958, it only increased by about 3%, or 600,000 tons, which is equivalent to only one and a half week's average production.

The total pig iron production in Britain in 1959 was 12.6 million tons, a decrease of 1.7 million tons compared to 1957 and a decrease of 400,000 tons compared to 1958.

Xinhua News Agency, London, January 13th: The Chairman of the British National Coal Board, James Bowman, announced today that Britain's coal production will be cut again this year by 11.1 million tons, producing only 195 million tons. Forty-six mines will be closed to reduce production.

This measure is to prevent an increase in Britain's coal storage this year.

Open-pit coal mine production will be reduced by 4 million tons, producing only 7 million tons in total. This is less than half of the production capacity.

In addition to the closure of forty-six mines, some mining faces or mining areas within the coal mines will be temporarily closed. In some cases, production will be changed to a one-shift system.

From 1956 to 1959, Britain's domestic coal consumption decreased by 28 million tons. The decline is partly due to competition from oil and electricity, but mainly due to industrial decline and stagnation.

    英国钢煤生产不振
    去年钢产量二千零二十万吨
    今年煤产量预计不到两亿吨
    新华社伦敦13日电　英国钢铁局今晚宣布，英国在1959年钢的总产量为二千零二十万吨。这个产量比1957年减产一百五十万吨；比危机冲击的1958年虽然有所增产，但是只增加3％左右，合六十万吨，仅相当于一个半星期的平均产量。
    英国1959年生铁的总产量为一千二百六十万吨，比1957年减产一百七十万吨，比1958年减产四十万吨。
    新华社伦敦13日电　英国国家煤业局主席詹姆斯·鲍曼今日宣布，英国的煤产量今年将再度削减一千一百万吨，只生产一亿九千五百万吨。四十六个矿井将关闭以便减少产量。
    这个措施是为了防止今年英国煤的储存量增加。
    露天煤矿的产量将减少四百万吨，一共只生产七百万吨。这个数量还不到生产能力的一半。
    除了将关闭四十六个矿井以外，还将暂时封闭煤井内的某些采掘面或采掘区。在某些情况下，生产要改为一班制。
    从1956年到1959年，英国国内煤的消费量下降了二千八百万吨。下降的原因部分是由于石油和电力的竞争，但是主要是由于工业的衰退和停滞。
