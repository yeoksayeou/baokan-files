Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: A large-scale winter water conservancy construction upsurge has been underway in rural areas across the country for more than a month. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 1.5 million large, medium, and small water conservancy projects under construction in various regions (excluding some small soil and water conservation projects), with more than 70 million people working nationwide. Although most areas have entered the severe winter season, the large and small water conservancy construction sites across the country are a scene of bustling labor.

The scale and progress of this winter construction have greatly exceeded those of 1958. By the end of December last year, the amount of earthwork completed by large, medium, and small projects nationwide had reached 11.6 billion cubic meters. Gansu, Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces have completed the originally scheduled winter construction plans ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. Some major projects, such as the Weishan Hub Project, which cuts off the Yellow River, and the Danjiangkou Hub Project, which crosses the Han River, have recently been successfully dammed ahead of schedule. Other examples include the Fenhe Reservoir in Shanxi, the Qinghe Reservoir in Liaoning, the Fuhe Dam in Jiangxi, the Dongzhen Reservoir in Fujian, as well as the Sanmenxia Hub Project and the Qingtongxia Hub Project on the Yellow River, all of which have also completed the 1959 construction plans ahead of schedule. Many small projects built by people's communes across the country and some medium-sized projects renovated in various places have been completed. Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guizhou alone have completed more than 200,000 medium and small projects.

Due to the implementation of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party regarding opposing right-leaning tendencies, encouraging greater efforts, increasing production and practicing economy, winter water conservancy construction in various places showed great determination from the leaders and sufficient drive from the masses from the very beginning. In provinces such as Hubei and Anhui, the First Secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee and the People's Commune Party Committee are responsible for grasping water conservancy construction. Leaders in various places focused on both engineering and the livelihood of migrant workers, organizing pig raising and vegetable planting on construction sites to ensure that migrant workers were well-fed, warmly housed, and had a balance between work and rest, thus increasing their enthusiasm. In many areas, with the rapid increase in the progress of winter water conservancy construction, the planned targets were revised, and some engineering tasks were added.

In order to enable the newly built projects to quickly and fully exert their benefits, all localities have paid attention to making the projects and machinery complete sets, and to combining large, medium, and small scales. The winter construction projects in Fan County, Shou Zhang, and other counties in Shandong Province are all complete sets, from hub projects and canal projects to field projects, striving to complete them in one go. Liaoning Province has also made great efforts to support projects, and many water conservancy projects in Jin County have achieved the goal of having reservoirs, canals, wells, and tools. Many small projects in Hebei, Gansu and other provinces are being built, storing water, and winter irrigating at the same time. River network projects in various places are also developing towards a more complete degree. In northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui, in addition to renovating the old river networks, great efforts are being made to excavate new river networks to improve drought resistance and flood drainage capabilities.

Due to the greater maturity of experience and technology in water conservancy construction, this winter construction is not only fast in progress but also of good quality. At present, the high-efficiency and high-quality movement centered on tool reform is developing vigorously. Various places have widely adopted various methods such as vehicles (transportation), machinery (semi-mechanization and earth mechanization), blasting (loosening blasting and directional blasting), livestock (cattle herds, plow groups), sliding (chutes, slings, ice roads, sledges for transporting soil), traction (rope traction), water (dumping soil into water to build dams, water flushing sand), rolling (compaction) to fully reform the excavation, loading, transportation, unloading, and compaction processes in construction. In the short span of more than two months from the beginning of winter construction to the present, various advanced tools have been created and reformed more than 20 million pieces, which has increased the national average daily work efficiency much higher than in the same period in 1958. While focusing on work efficiency, all localities have paid attention to ensuring engineering quality and construction safety. Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi and other provinces have conducted major inspections of engineering quality. Henan and other provinces have established mass engineering acceptance organizations. Jiangxi Province has proposed to do a good job on one and guarantee one, in addition to organizing inspections, technical personnel are also dispatched to more than 100 large construction sites to strengthen technical leadership. The completed projects in Hunan Province have been inspected and are mostly up to standard and of good quality.

From now until the Spring Festival, it is an important period for winter water conservancy construction. Relevant central departments require all localities to conduct a comprehensive inspection of water conservancy projects from now on (inspections in some provinces have already begun) so that winter water conservancy projects can smoothly pass the seven barriers of winter cold, rain, snow, fire safety, diversion and interception, spring flood, quality, flood control, and project support; at the same time, seize the time to store water and carry out winter and spring irrigation work, and strive for most projects to play a role in flood control and exert other benefits before the flood season this year. This inspection is carried out in conjunction with the inspection of all farmland capital construction. The inspection content includes land leveling, soil improvement, irrigation management, soil and water conservation, as well as the repair and installation of drainage and irrigation machinery, the construction of rural small hydropower stations, and so on, so that water conservancy work can fully exert its benefits.

### 持续开展高工效运动　全面开展工程大检查  力争冬修水利早完工早受益  全国兴修一百五十多万处工程，去年底完成一百一十六亿土方

    持续开展高工效运动　全面开展工程大检查
    力争冬修水利早完工早受益
    全国兴修一百五十多万处工程，去年底完成一百一十六亿土方
    据新华社3日讯　全国农村大规模的冬修水利高潮已经持续了一个多月。据不完全的统计，现在各地正在兴修的大、中、小型的水利工程共达一百五十多万处（不包括一些小型的水土保持工程），全国上工人数达七千万以上。虽然大部分地区已进入严寒季节，遍布全国各地的大小水利工地上，却是一片热火朝天的劳动景象。
    这次冬修规模和进度都大大超过了1958年。到去年12月底，全国大中小工程完成的土方数量已达一百一十六亿立方米。甘肃、湖南、江西等省已提前超额完成了原订的冬修计划。有些大工程如腰斩黄河的位山枢纽工程、横断汉江的丹江口枢纽工程，都于最近提前胜利截流。又如山西汾河水库、辽宁清河水库、江西抚河大坝、福建东圳水库，以及黄河的三门峡枢纽工程、青铜峡枢纽工程等也都提前完成了1959年度的施工计划。全国人民公社所修的小型工程和各地续修的一些中型工程有许多已经完工。仅湖北、浙江、江西、贵州已完成的中小工程就有二十多万处。
    由于贯彻了党的八届八中全会关于反右倾、鼓干劲、增产节约的指示，各地冬修水利一开始就表现出领导决心大和群众干劲足。湖北、安徽等省从省委到人民公社党委都是由第一书记负责抓水利建设。各地领导一手抓工程，一手抓民工生活，组织工地养猪种菜，使民工吃得饱、住得暖，有劳有逸，干劲愈来愈大。不少地区随着水利冬修进度的迅速提高，改订了计划指标，增加了一部分工程任务。
    为了使新修的工程迅速充分发挥效益，各地都注意了使工程和机具成套和大中小结合。山东省范县、寿张等县的冬修工程都是成套的，从枢纽工程、渠道工程直到田间工程，力争一气呵成。辽宁省也大抓配套，锦县的许多水利工程已做到有库有渠、有井有具。河北、甘肃等省很多小工程都是边修、边蓄水、边冬灌。各地河网化工程也向更完善的程度发展。苏北、皖北除整修旧河网外，正以大力开挖新河网，提高抗旱除涝能力。
    由于兴修水利的经验和技术更加成熟，这次冬修不但进度快，而且质量好。目前以工具改革为中心的高工效、高质量运动正在如火如荼地发展。各地广泛采用车（车子）机（半机械化和土机械化）爆（松动爆破和定向爆破）畜（牛群、犁群）滑（滑道、吊索、冰道、爬犁运土）牵（绳索牵引）水（水中倒土筑坝、水冲沙）碾（碾压）等各种办法，全面改革施工中的挖、装、运、卸、压各个工序。各地从开始冬修到现在的短短两个多月里，已创制、改革了各种先进工具二千多万件，使全国平均日工效比1958年同期提高很多。各地在大抓工效的同时，都注意了保证工程质量和施工安全。河北、河南、安徽、江西等省都进行了工程质量大检查。河南等省建立了群众性的工程验收组织。江西省提出做好一个，保证一个，除组织检查外，并派出技术人员到一百多处大工地加强技术领导。湖南省已完成的工程经过验收大部合乎规格，质量良好。
    从现在到春节，是水利冬修的重要时期。中央有关部门要求各地从现在起对水利工程进行一次全面的大检查（有些省的检查已经开始），使冬修水利工程能够顺利地过好冬寒雨雪、防火安全、导流截流、春汛、质量、拦洪、工程配套等七关；同时抓紧蓄水和冬春灌工作，争取大部分工程在今年汛期前起到拦洪作用和发挥其他效益。这次检查与全部农田基本建设的检查是联在一起进行，检查内容包括土地平整、土壤改良、灌溉管理、水土保持以及排灌机械的整修安装、农村小型水电站的建设等等，以便水利工作能够充分发挥效益。
