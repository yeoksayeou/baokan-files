Nanfeng County Runs Rural Party School, Achieving Multiple Benefits
    Resolves Conflicts Between Cadre Study, Labor, and Work; Also Serves as a Work Team and Propaganda Team
    Trainees Improve Political Consciousness, Strengthen Labor Viewpoint, and Learn Production Techniques
    Specific practices: 1. Select school locations based on the political and ideological situation of each term's trainees. If the trainees have a high level of political consciousness, move to backward areas to hold classes, using the trainees' exemplary actions to influence local cadres and the masses; if the trainees have a poor level of political consciousness, move to advanced areas to hold classes, using local living teaching materials to educate the trainees. 2. Trainees eat, live, and labor with the masses. 3. The content of study includes the Party's guidelines and policies, basic political theory, and production technology, with two-thirds of the time spent studying politics and one-third of the time participating in production labor.
    Nanchang, January 12 (Our Own Correspondent) The Party School of the Nanfeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Fuzhou Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, has moved to the countryside to hold classes, allowing cadres to study, labor, and help the community with its work, enabling them to achieve all-round success in study, labor training, and work.
    The Fuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that Nanfeng County's method of running rural party schools is a new path for county-run party schools. Recently, the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee held an on-site meeting in Nanfeng County to introduce and promote the school's experience to various counties.
    The Nanfeng County Party School was established under the situation of the Great Leap Forward. At the beginning of 1959, the whole county saw a situation of continued leap forward. At this time, the broad masses of cadres urgently demanded to study and participate in labor training to improve themselves and adapt to the needs of the situation. However, in the past, the study objects of the county-run party school -- county-level organ cadres, commune cadres, and main cadres of production brigades -- had heavy work tasks and could not leave their posts to participate in study and labor training continuously for three or six months in a year. Based on this situation, the Nanfeng County Committee established a party school that combined study, labor, and work, and moved the party school to the countryside, solving the contradiction between cadre study, labor training and work. So far, this party school has held nine sessions, training 1,002 cadres. County-level organ cadres, general commune cadres, and main brigade cadres throughout the county have been trained once.
    The method of the Nanfeng County Party School moving to the countryside to run the school is: 1. Select the school site according to the political and ideological situation of the trainees in each term. If the political consciousness of the trainees in this term is poor, it will be moved to an advanced area to hold the school, and the trainees will be educated with local living teaching materials; if the political consciousness of the trainees in this term is high, it will be moved to a backward area to hold the school, and the cadres and the masses will be influenced by the exemplary actions of the trainees. 2. The trainees eat, live, and work with the masses. The trainees, like commune members going to the countryside, live in the homes of the masses, eat in the mess halls of the masses, and participate in the labor of the production team. 3. The content of the study includes the Party's guidelines and policies, basic political theory, and production technology. The study time is based on the principle of "study more during slack seasons, study less during busy seasons, study production more on sunny days, and study politics more on rainy days," with two-thirds of the time spent on political study and one-third of the time spent on production labor.
    Through studying political theory, the trainees improved their political and ideological consciousness. In political courses, the trainees successively studied the Party's general line for socialist construction, "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Due to the adoption of methods that combined study with labor and work and on-the-spot teaching, the learning effect was better, and the trainees rapidly improved their thinking, further strengthened their confidence in building socialism, and further boosted their revolutionary drive. For example, Zheng Zhengcai, the captain of the Xiping Brigade of the Qiawan Commune, was not active enough in work and labor before entering the school. After studying, he actively worked and took the lead in labor. He said, "In the past, I had the thought of slackening and regressing, and I didn't keep up with the situation of the Great Leap Forward. In the future, I guarantee to do my job well." In winter production, Zheng Zhengcai led the commune members to repair water conservancy facilities and accumulate fertilizer, and has become an excellent production captain. Another example is Li Jitang, a doctor at the County Health Center, who was unwilling to go to the countryside to treat illnesses in the past, and would not make house calls at night or to distant places, and the commune members called him "Doctor Master". After studying and labor training at the Party School, his ideology improved and he voluntarily asked to go to the countryside to treat the masses. During the autumn harvest and winter planting, Li Jitang carried his medical kit deep into the fields and construction sites, treating the masses and helping them with production, integrating himself with the masses, who called him "People's Doctor."
    After studying at the Party School, the trainees learned labor training and also learned a lot of production knowledge and technology. Dai Zhengyan, a cadre directly under the county-level organs, went from school to the organs and had never participated in labor before. He not only did not understand production knowledge, but also despised labor. After studying at the Party School, he learned agricultural production techniques such as plowing, harrowing, transplanting rice seedlings, and weeding, and realized the significance of labor and enhanced his labor concept. He said, "Three months of studying at the Party School is better than reading behind closed doors for ten years." Many cadres from communes and production brigades learned more after studying at the Party School. They successively studied soil science, variety science, and agricultural knowledge such as making pesticides, indigenous fertilizers, pest control, and the use of agricultural machinery, creating favorable conditions for better leadership of production in the future.
    The Party School goes to the countryside and chooses school sites according to the ideological situation of the trainees. It not only played the role of a work team, a propaganda team and a model leader, promoted the work, but also educated the trainees. Raobu Production Brigade of Shishan Commune was originally a relatively backward brigade. After the Party School moved to this team, the trainees helped the brigade party branch improve its working methods while taking the lead in working hard and driving the masses with exemplary actions. As a result, this brigade quickly improved its backward situation and ranked first in the whole commune in the autumn harvest and winter production campaign. Changling Brigade of Qiawan Commune is an advanced production team. The commune members have a high level of awareness and great enthusiasm. When the Party School moved here, the Party School educated the trainees with the vivid examples of this team, and organized the trainees to work together with the commune members, influencing the trainees with the exemplary actions of the commune members. At the same time, the Party School also organized the trainees to help the team party branch summarize advanced work experience. As a result, it not only educated the trainees and learned a lot of work experience, but also disseminated the experience and promoted the work in other regions.
    Moving the Party School to the countryside saved school expenses. In the past, running a Party School in the county seat required 600 yuan for each training of 50 people; after moving to the countryside, each training of more than 100 people required less than 200 yuan. The county party committee originally allocated 2,000 yuan to the Party School this year to build school buildings. Since it has moved to the countryside, there is no need to build school buildings, and no money has been spent so far, and all of it has been saved. (Liu Guanghui)

    南丰县下乡办党校一举数得
    解决了干部学习、劳动和工作的矛盾，又起了工作队宣传队的作用
    学员提高了政治觉悟，增强了劳动观点，学到了生产技术
    具体做法：一、根据各期学员的政治思想情况选择校址。学员政治觉悟较高，就搬到落后地区举办，以学员的模范行动影响当地干部群众；学员政治觉悟较差，就搬到先进地区举办，以当地的活教材教育学员。二、学员和群众同吃同住同劳动。三、学习内容包括党的方针政策、基本政治理论和生产技术，三分之二时间学政治，三分之一时间参加生产劳动。
    本报南昌12日电　中共江西省抚州专区南丰县委党校搬到农村举办，入校干部既学习、又劳动、又帮助社里工作，使他们获得了学习、劳动锻炼和工作的全面丰收。
    中共抚州地委认为：南丰县下乡办党校的方法是县办党校的一个新途径。最近，抚州地委在南丰县召开了现场会议，向各县介绍与推广这所党校的办学经验。
    南丰县委党校，是在大跃进的形势下举办起来的。1959年年初，全县出现了继续跃进的形势。这时，广大干部迫切要求学习，迫切要求参加劳动锻炼，以提高自己，适应形势的需要。可是，过去县办党校的学习对象——县级机关干部、公社干部、生产大队主要干部的工作任务繁重，他们离不开工作岗位，不能在一年内抽出三个月或六个月的时间接连参加学习和劳动锻炼。根据这种情况，南丰县委举办了一所学习、劳动、工作三结合的党校，把党校搬下农村，解决了干部学习、劳动锻炼与工作的矛盾。至今，这所党校已开办了九期，训练了一千零二名干部。全县县级机关干部、公社一般干部、大队主要干部都已进校训练了一次。
    南丰县委党校搬下农村办学的方法是：一、根据各期学员的政治思想情况选择校址。这期学员政治觉悟较差，就搬到先进地区举办，以当地活教材教育学员；这期学员政治觉悟较高，就搬到落后地区举办，以学员的模范行动影响当地干部、群众。二、学员和群众同吃同住同劳动。学员如同下乡当社员一样，寄居在群众家里，在群众食堂吃饭，参加生产队的劳动。三、学习内容包括党的方针政策、基本政治理论和生产技术。学习时间以“农闲多学、农忙少学，晴天多学生产、雨天多学政治”为原则，以三分之二的时间学习政治，三分之一的时间参加生产劳动。
    学员们通过学习政治理论，提高了政治思想觉悟。学员在政治课程中先后学习了党的社会主义建设总路线、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“实践论”、“矛盾论”和党的八届八中全会的文件。由于采取了学习与劳动、工作相结合和实地教学的方法，学习效果更好，学员们迅速提高了思想，更加坚定了建设社会主义信心，更加鼓舞了革命干劲。例如洽湾公社西坪大队队长郑正才，入学前工作劳动都不够积极，经过学习后，积极工作，带头劳动。他说：“过去我有松劲退坡思想，没有跟上大跃进的形势，今后保证做好工作。”在冬季生产中，郑正才带领社员修水利、积肥料，已成为一名出色的生产队长。又如，县卫生院医士李际唐，过去不愿下乡治病，晚上、路远不出诊，社员说他是“医生老爷”。经过党校学习和劳动锻炼，提高了思想，自动要求下乡为群众治病。在秋收冬种中，李际唐背着医药箱深入田间、工地，一面给群众治病一面帮助群众搞生产，和群众打成一片，群众说他是“人民医师”。
    经过党校学习，学员们学到了劳动锻炼，还学到了许多生产知识和技术。县直属机关干部戴征焱，从学校到机关，过去从未参加过劳动，不仅不懂生产知识，还轻视劳动。在党校学习后，他学会了犁田、耙田、栽秧、耘田等农业生产技术，并体会到了劳动的意义，增强了劳动观念。他说：“党校学习三个月，胜读十年闭门书”。许多公社、生产大队的干部经过党校学习，学到了更多的东西。他们先后学习了土壤学、品种学和制造农药、土化肥、防治虫害和使用农业机械等农业知识，为今后更好地领导生产创造了有利条件。
    党校下乡，根据学员思想情况选择校址，既发挥了工作队、宣传队和模范带头作用，推动了工作，又使学员受到了教育。市山公社饶埠生产大队原来是个比较落后的大队，党校搬到这个队举办后，学员们一面帮助大队党支部改进工作方法，一面带头苦干，以模范行动带动群众。结果这个大队迅速改进了落后面貌，在秋收和冬季生产运动中，名列全社第一。洽湾公社长岭大队是个先进生产队，社员觉悟高、干劲大，党校搬到这里举办时，党校就以这个队的生动事例教育学员，并组织学员和社员一起劳动，以社员的模范行动影响学员。同时，党校还组织学员们帮助该队党支部总结了先进工作经验。结果，不仅教育了学员，学到了许多工作经验，还传播了经验，促进了其他地区的工作。
    党校搬到农村举办，节省了办学经费。过去在县城办党校，每期训练五十个人，需要经费六百元；搬下农村后每期训练一百人以上，需要的经费不到二百元。县委今年原来拨给党校二千元资金兴建校舍，由于搬下了农村，不需要兴建校舍，至今分文未用，全部节省下来了。　　　　　　（刘光辉）
