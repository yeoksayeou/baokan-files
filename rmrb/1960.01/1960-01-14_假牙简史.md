    A Brief History of Dentures
    The earliest artificial teeth in ancient times were carved from ivory, tortoise shells, or animal teeth. At that time, people did not know how to make denture clasps. For aesthetic purposes, they used various colored silk threads or gold threads to tie the dentures to the remaining real teeth to fill the gaps. Of course, this method of attachment was not very secure. In the eighteenth century, dentures made of mother-of-pearl and porcelain began to be used, which were more practical. It was not until recent years that plastic was used to make artificial teeth with firm alveolar ridges. However, artificial teeth are ultimately not as comfortable and sensitive as real teeth. Recently, surgeons have successfully experimented with "real tooth transplantation." An eleven-year-old girl's misaligned upper jaw tooth was extracted and transplanted to her twenty-two-year-old brother (who had a missing front tooth). The transplanted tooth is exactly the same as a natural tooth.

    假牙简史
    古时候最初的人造牙是用象牙、龟甲或动物牙齿雕成的，那时人还不会做假牙爪，只是为了美观，用各色丝线或金丝把假牙栓在未脱落的真牙上以弥补豁隙。当然这种栓法不是很牢固的。到了十八世纪开始用珠母、陶瓷配制假牙，就比较实用些了。直到最近若干年来才应用塑料配制牢固合槽的人造牙。但是人造牙究竟不像真牙那样舒适而有知觉。最近外科医生试验“真牙移植”成功。一个十一岁的女孩长歪的上颚齿被摘下而移植给她二十二岁的哥哥（上门牙缺损者）。移植的牙和生来的牙完全一样。
