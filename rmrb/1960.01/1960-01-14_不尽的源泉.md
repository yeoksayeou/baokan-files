    Inexhaustible Source

    The rapidly developing socialist construction undertaking requires us to quickly create a contingent of worker-class technical cadres.
    Worker-class technical cadres must be cultivated both by relying on universities and colleges, and also by cultivating and promoting them from within the ranks of workers. Today's news in this newspaper from the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant tells us that actively cultivating and selecting large numbers of technical cadres from within the ranks of workers is the most important measure for creating a contingent of worker-class technical cadres.
    Technical cadres who grow up from the ranks of workers have many outstanding advantages. The vast majority of them are full of energy, dare to think and act, and are wholeheartedly loyal to the socialist cause. They have a natural and close connection with the masses of workers, as well as rich technical experience and the ability to solve practical problems. The advantages possessed by these technical cadres are precisely the essential conditions for the worker-class technical cadres that our Party needs, who are both red and expert. China's worker-class ranks are constantly expanding, and the political, cultural, and technical levels of the broad masses of workers are also increasing day by day; this constitutes the most powerful and solid reserve force and an inexhaustible source of technical cadres.
    However, some people say: "The old experiences and old skills of worker technical cadres can still be used for the moment, but in the future, as production develops towards 'high, precise, and advanced,' their set of skills will no longer be sufficient. Promoting technical cadres from the ranks of workers is a path that must be taken now, but probably won't be necessary in the future." These people's views are incorrect. They neglect the fact that with the development of production technology, the practical operating experience and technical theoretical level of the entire working class, including worker technical cadres, are also correspondingly improving. As production develops towards "high, precise, and advanced," the skills of technical workers will also improve accordingly. Therefore, cultivating and promoting technical cadres from among the workers is not an "expedient" measure, but a long-term policy of the Party for selecting cadres. Therefore, this view is nothing more than an excuse to oppose the Party's correct policy of massively promoting and cultivating technical cadres from among the workers, and opposes the "walking on two legs" approach to cultivating technical cadres.
    It should be admitted that China's existing worker technical cadres are still in a state of low cultural level and relatively lacking in technical theory. If we do not do everything possible to improve the existing level of these cadres and raise their rich practical experience to the theoretical stage, then they will not be able to meet the requirements of production development. In fact, the development of production technology is advancing rapidly. It is not just worker technical cadres who need to improve rapidly; even those technical cadres who already possess a high cultural level and superb scientific and technical theory, if they only maintain their existing level and do not pay attention to improvement, will inevitably fall behind the situation. Therefore, we must always pay close attention to the work of cultivating and improving technical cadres in order to keep up with the needs of the developing situation. The Party organizations and leading comrades of all factories should, like the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, conscientiously do a good job in cultivating and selecting technical cadres from the masses of workers; and for those worker technical cadres who have already been promoted, it is even more important to focus on the work of cultivation and education, and constantly improve their political, cultural, and technical levels.

    不尽的源泉
    鲍春光
    飞跃发展的社会主义建设事业，需要我们迅速造就一支工人阶级技术干部队伍。
    工人阶级的技术干部，一方面要依靠大专学校来培养，另一方面还必须从工人队伍中去培养和提拔。今天本报刊登的戚墅堰机车车辆工厂的消息告诉我们，在工人队伍里积极培养和大量选拔技术干部，是造就工人阶级技术干部队伍的一项最重要的措施。
    从工人队伍里成长起来的技术干部，有许多突出的优点。他们中间绝大多数人都干劲十足，敢想敢干，对社会主义事业忠心耿耿。他们与工人群众有着天然的血肉联系，还有丰富的技术经验和解决实际问题的本领。这些技术干部所具有的优点，正是我们党所需要的又红又专的工人阶级技术干部必备的条件。我国工人阶级队伍正在不断扩大，广大工人群众的政治、文化和技术水平也在日益提高；这就成为技术干部的最强大、最雄厚的后备力量和取之不尽、用之不竭的泉源。
    但是有些人说：“工人技术干部的那一套老经验、老本领，在目前搞搞还可以，今后生产向‘高、精、尖’发展，他们那一套就不行了。从工人队伍里提拔技术干部这条路，现在必须走，将来恐怕就不必走了。”这些人的观点是不对的。他们忽视了随着生产技术水平的发展，包括工人技术干部在内的整个工人阶级的实际操作经验和技术理论水平也在相应地提高。生产向“高、精、尖”发展，技术工人的技能也会随着提高。因此，从工人中培养和提拔技术干部，不是“权宜”之计，而是党的选拔干部的长远方针。所以，这种观点无非是用来反对党的从工人中大量提拔和培养技术干部的正确方针的借口，是反对培养技术干部中“两条腿走路”的方针。
    应当承认，我国现有的工人技术干部，还处于文化水平不高、技术理论比较缺乏的状态，如果不千方百计地提高这些干部的现有水平，不使他们丰富的实践经验提高到理论阶段，那就不能适应生产发展的要求。其实，生产技术的发展一日千里，岂止是工人技术干部需要迅速提高，即使是那些已经具备了高度文化水平和精湛科学技术理论的技术干部，如果仅仅维持现有水平而不注意提高，又何尝不会落后于形势呢？所以，必须时时抓紧培养和提高技术干部的工作，才能赶上形势发展的需要。一切工厂的党组织和领导同志，都应当像戚墅堰机车车辆工厂那样，认真做好从工人群众中培养和选拔技术干部的工作；对于那些已经提拔起来的工人技术干部，更要抓紧培养和教育的工作，不断提高他们的政治、文化和技术水平。
