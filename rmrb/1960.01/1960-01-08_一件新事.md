    A New Thing
    Zibo City’s use of native iron to cast heavy-duty native iron rails, directly connected to the steel rail railway special line, is a new thing.
    If in 1958, some people still had doubts about the use of native iron, then the facts of 1959 have already shattered these doubts. Native iron can not only be used to manufacture many kinds of agricultural tools and small equipment, but also can be cast into iron rails of good quality and considerable pressure-bearing capacity. This has opened up new horizons for the wider application of native iron, and has opened our minds and suggested the future for us to further utilize native iron and other products produced by indigenous methods. Using native iron to cast rails is very important for strengthening the weak link of transportation. An important task in developing the national economy in 1960 is to strengthen the construction of transportation, so that transportation can adapt to the needs of the continued leap forward in production and construction. Zibo City’s experience has practical significance for solving the current short-distance transportation of factories and mines.

    一件新事
    淄博市用土铁铸造重型土铁轨，直接与钢轨铁路专用线衔接起来，这是一件新事。
    如果说1958年，还有人对土铁的用场发生怀疑的话，那么，1959年的事实早已打破了这种怀疑。土铁，不仅可以用来制造出许多种农具和小器材，而且可以铸造出质量良好、具有相当承压能力的铁轨来。这就为土铁更加广泛的应用开辟了新的天地，又为我们进一步利用土铁和其他土法生产出的产品，打开了脑筋，提示了前程。用土铁来铸造铁轨，对加强交通运输这个薄弱环节，甚为重要。1960年发展国民经济的一项重要任务，是加强交通运输的建设，使交通运输同生产建设继续跃进的需要相适应。淄博市的经验，对于解决当前厂矿短途运输有它的现实意义。
