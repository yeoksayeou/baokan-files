    Red Clouds Bring Happiness

    "The Five Finger Mountain peaks are high, five red clouds shine in the sky. I wish the red clouds would descend, suffering would dissipate and happiness would arrive." This is a myth circulating among the Li people under the enslavement of the Kuomintang reactionaries at the foot of Five Finger Mountain, praying for happiness. In order to defend their lives, they organized the Fu'an Group and rose up to fight the enemy. However, due to the lack of Party leadership, their spontaneous struggle in the Battle of Xuelei Ridge resulted in almost complete annihilation. They resolved to find the Party and continue the fight. Finally, they obtained the Party's leadership, eliminated the reactionaries, and turned the Li people's myth into reality, living a happy life.

    This is the synopsis of the film "Five Red Clouds," adapted by the August First Film Studio from the excellent program of the Second All-Army Literary and Art Performance, a dance drama of the same name. It is directed by Hua Chun and Cha Li, with music composed by Yan Ke, and performed by the original cast of the stage play. (Picture attached)

    红云带着幸福来
    “五指山峰高又高，五朵红云天上照，但愿红云降下来，苦难消散幸福到。”这是五指山下受着国民党反动派奴役的黎族人民中，流传着的祈求幸福的神话。他们为了保卫自己的生活，组织了福安团，起来和敌人战斗。但是缺乏党的领导的自发斗争，血泪岭一战，几乎全军复没。他们决心去找党，继续战斗。终于获得了党的领导，消灭了反动派，使黎族人民的神话变成了现实，过着幸福的生活。
    这是八一电影制片厂根据第二届全军文艺会演中优秀节目、同名舞剧改编的影片“五朵红云”的梗概。由华纯、查利导演，彦克作曲，舞台剧的原班人马演出。（附图片）
