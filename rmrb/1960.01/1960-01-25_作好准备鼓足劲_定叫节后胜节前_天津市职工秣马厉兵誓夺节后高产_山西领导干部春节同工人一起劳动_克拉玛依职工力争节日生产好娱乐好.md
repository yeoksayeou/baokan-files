Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 24th: Tianjin's industrial front workers are actively preparing for post-Spring Festival production.

    The preparation work in various factories started early and is proceeding quickly, with comprehensive and meticulous planning. The city has formed a maintenance team of more than 30,000 people to conduct a comprehensive overhaul of machinery and equipment. The Hedong District factories have formulated more than 2,700 maintenance projects, of which more than 1,000 have already been completed. The Hebei District is planning to overhaul more than 1,700 key projects. The Nankai District workers are determined to complete the overhaul of more than 2,500 machines and equipment before the Spring Festival.

    To reserve sufficient raw materials, various industrial bureaus and factories are actively adopting measures such as clearing inventories, adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, bartering goods, practicing thrift and substitution, and expediting external requisitioning. The Feilong Rubber Factory launched a campaign to break through the raw material barrier, and within a few days, it achieved more than 20 major innovations, successfully developing the use of styrene-butadiene rubber to replace natural rubber in the manufacture of battery boxes and acid-resistant gloves. The Fourth Plumbing Factory adopted various methods and quickly prepared the raw materials needed for February production. Cadres of the Xinhua Paper Mill generally used their spare time to assist in the transportation of raw materials.

    The city's factories and enterprises have devolved the production plan to the team and group levels. After discussion, the workers have formulated guarantee measures to over fulfill the plan and are carrying out preparations for technical data, forgings, castings, blanks, and tools. In mid-January, the Tianjin No. 1 Machine Tool Factory devolved the February production plan to various workshops. During the discussion of the plan, the workers were determined to break the "old conventions" and strive to produce five 541 gear shapers and fifteen hydraulic components on the first day of work after the Spring Festival. Factories, workshops, and teams have formulated technical measures and launched mass activities to tackle key problems, achieving twenty-six major measures within a week. The foundry workshop has cast the blanks needed by the machining workshop for February, and the machining workshop has processed the parts needed by the assembly workshop for February, ensuring that the assembly workshop can produce finished products on the first day of work after the holiday.

    The city's industrial workers are now putting forward the slogan "Every second counts before the holiday; Guarantee a full house after the holiday, guaranteeing that February exceeds January," and are launching a Spring Festival red competition. Many district, bureau, and factory leaders are also participating in production and strengthening guidance.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 24th: Five hundred and thirty-three cadres from the industrial and transportation leading organs of Shanxi Province departed on the 23rd for the forefront of industrial production in Taiyuan, Datong, Changzhi, Yangquan, and other cities to participate in the pre- and post-Spring Festival production competition with the vast number of workers in the province and celebrate the Spring Festival together. Among the cadres going down are Chi Biqing, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Guo Qin'an, Minister of the Industrial and Transportation Department of the Provincial Party Committee, and responsible cadres of various provincial departments and bureaus. A large number of cadres from local party committees and municipal party committees in Shanxi Province are also going to the forefront of industrial production.

    Cadres going to the front line of production to work and enjoy themselves with the workers is an important measure taken by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to make post-Spring Festival production even better. The Provincial Party Committee requires these cadres to help enterprises organize production before and after the Spring Festival on the basis of a good start in the New Year, so that production can steadily rise; at the same time, they should help enterprises further develop the socialist competition movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, January 24th: While completing their daily production plans, workers in the Karamay Oilfield are actively taking measures to ensure that production, safety, hygiene, living conditions, and cultural entertainment are all good during the Spring Festival.

    In recent days, various departments of the oilfield have done a lot of work to ensure good production. Thirty new wells, planned to be put into production in January, are about to be put into production. All kinds of major materials needed for Spring Festival production have been prepared. Machines that need to be overhauled are being overhauled. All units have organized working groups to conduct safety inspections, and from the 25th to the 27th, the entire mining area will also conduct a major inspection to ensure safe production during the holidays. The workers have also launched a mass clean-up campaign to ensure a clean Spring Festival.

    In order to allow the vast number of workers and their families to happily celebrate the Spring Festival, the mining area's commercial departments have prepared various non-staple foods and sweets, and have decided that various food stores will be open as usual during the Spring Festival. They will also organize mobile sales teams to deliver holiday goods to workers in the field. Various canteens have also made guarantees to ensure that everyone eats well during the holiday.

    Currently, the mining area is holding literary and artistic performances to select excellent programs in preparation for the Spring Festival performance. The club has prepared seven good films, including "Song of Youth".
