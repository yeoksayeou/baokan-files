    Raise More Sows, Produce More Piglets
    Hubei Universally Raises "First-Litter Sows," Effectively Solving the Pig Source Problem
    Huangyan Leaders, Cadres, Veterinarians, and Masses Combine to Select and Retain Sows Pen by Pen, Head by Head

    Wuhan, January 8th (This newspaper dispatch) To meet the urgent need to develop pig farming on a large scale, Hubei Province is widely promoting a method that combines "first-litter sows" with basic sows, and combines universal breeding with selection and breeding of improved breeds. People's communes and production teams are the units to accelerate self-breeding and self-propagation and expand the source of pigs.
    Raising "first-litter sows" is a revolutionary method for developing pig farming in areas currently lacking pig sources. This involves first keeping the born gilts, mating them all after they reach maturity to breed a generation, and then, based on the sow's reproductive capacity and the quality of the piglets produced, selecting the good ones to keep as basic sows, and castrating and fattening the poor ones after their first litter. This can quickly expand the source of pigs, increase pork production, and facilitate the selection of good breeds, which can be described as "killing three birds with one stone." Since the spring and summer of last year, Hubei Province has widely promoted this method throughout the province, and it has achieved very good results. In October of last year, the province raised 850,000 sows, and in November it rapidly increased to 950,000, an increase of 100,000 sows in one month. After Xianfeng County promoted the "first-litter sow" experience of the Jianshan Commune last spring, the county's pig breeding rose in a straight line, with an average of more than one sow for every two households, and the Jianshan and Yangdong Communes averaged more than one sow per household. In five months, Yu'an County more than doubled its number of sows, with the average monthly breeding of piglets soaring from 1,400 to 6,225, and the survival rate of piglets also increased from the original 74% to 85%. The Jurong Commune Chenggong Management Area in Hanyang County originally had only 20 sows. After the implementation of "first-litter sows," it quickly developed to 116, with more than 1,200 piglets already produced. The number of sows increased by four and a half times compared to the past, and the number of piglets increased by fifteen and a half times.
    The implementation of this method in various places quickly solved the local pig source supply problem, and also supported a large number of piglets to other counties, communes, and teams, promoting the overall development of the pig farming industry. The Jianshan Commune of Xianfeng County is known as the "Home of Pigs," and the piglets it breeds are of good quality and quantity, and many nearby places have received their support. The Yinglin Production Team of the Daishan Commune in Wuhan City vigorously bred "Wuhan White Pigs" (improved breeds) through the "first-litter sow" method. In a few months, the number of improved breed sows increased from more than 200 to more than 600. In addition to self-breeding and self-raising, it also supported 3,842 piglets within and outside the commune.
    While vigorously developing "first-litter sows," Hubei is gradually expanding the basic sow herds and universally establishing four-level breeding farms (i.e., commune, management area, production team, and small team), handing over the excellent sows selected from the "first-litter sows" with good breeds and high litter sizes to the breeding farms for special feeding and management. Yichang County has currently established more than 400 breeding pig farms. After the problem of pig sources was basically solved in the various-level breeding farms in three communes and twenty management areas in Yingshan County, they began to develop in the direction of improved breeds.
    Hubei is promoting advanced mating experience, and many places have launched a "five-full" (full retention, full mating, full pregnancy, full birth, full survival) campaign to focus on the full pregnancy of sows. Yu'an County has trained 250 mating technicians and established 176 mating technical guidance stations, which greatly improved the mating and breeding rate of sows. Various places have also implemented a reward system for pig breeding, further stimulating the enthusiasm of breeders and commune members to raise sows and accelerate breeding.

    Hangzhou, January 8th (This newspaper dispatch) The people's communes in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, actively expanded their sow herds, adopting a method that combined leaders, cadres, veterinarians, and the masses to select and retain sows pen by pen, head by head. In two and a half months, the number of sows raised in the county more than doubled, increasing from more than 29,000 in early October last year to more than 98,000. At the same time, thanks to the adoption of various advanced mating methods, adult sows were fully mated and fully pregnant, and the number of piglets bred increased significantly. In the past two and a half months, the county increased its pig population by more than 60,000.
    In developing pig farming, Huangyan County focused on sow cultivation, resolutely implemented the policy of self-selection, self-breeding, self-propagation, and self-raising, overcame the difficulty of insufficient pig sources, and strived to develop pig production at a high speed. The Huangyan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the slogan "Keep Every Sow You See, Select After Keeping, Select Good Ones from the Local Breed, and Gradually Improve the Breed," requiring all localities to rapidly expand the sow herd. The party committees of each commune adopted a method that combined leaders, cadres, veterinarians, and the masses, with the secretaries and members of the commune party committee dividing up the work and taking charge, leading a large number of veterinarians and commune members with experience in raising sows, going deep into the pig pens in separate groups, identifying them pen by pen, head by head, selecting all the sows to keep, registering and announcing them, and prohibiting castration. At the same time, a registration card was established for each sow, stating the sow's breed, age, mating time, and person in charge, and hung in front of the pen to keep track of breeding conditions and strengthen the management of sows. In the selection and retention of sows, each commune adjusted the privately raised sows of commune members according to the principle of equal value exchange, concentrating the sows in the pig farms or breeding pig farms of the commune and team for feeding.
    After Huangyan County adopted these measures, the number of sows surged. Now, on average, there is one sow for every three pigs in the county. Of the county's more than 160,000 commune members, an average of one sow is raised per two households. Many communes and production teams have an average of more than one sow per household.
    While rapidly expanding the sow herd, the communes in Huangyan County launched a full-mating, full-pregnancy campaign centered on full mating, full pregnancy, full birth, full survival, and full growth, and universally promoted advanced mating methods such as double mating, repeat mating, and artificial insemination to improve the breeding rate and piglet survival rate of adult sows. One hundred and twenty-five artificial insemination stations have been established throughout the county, and artificial insemination and multiple insemination methods have been widely adopted to improve the utilization rate of improved breed boars. The full pregnancy rate of adult sows in the county, except for those with piglets, reached more than 95%. Many sows have high litter sizes, producing three litters a year, with more than 20 piglets per litter. (Attached picture)

    多养母猪　多产仔猪
    湖北普遍饲养“一产母猪”，有效地解决了猪源问题
    黄岩领导干部、兽医、群众结合，逐栏逐头选留母猪
    本报武汉8日电　为了适应当前大量发展养猪事业的迫切需要，湖北省广泛推行“一产母猪”与基本母猪相结合、普遍繁殖与选育良种相结合的办法，以人民公社和生产队为单位，加快自养自繁速度，扩大猪源。
    饲养“一产母猪”，是目前猪源缺乏的地区发展养猪事业的一种革命性的办法。这就是先把生下来的小母猪留起来，成龄后全配上种繁殖一代，然后根据母猪的繁殖能力和产仔质量等情况，把好的选留为基本母猪，差的一产过后再阉割育肥。这样既能迅速地扩大猪源，又有利于肉猪的增产，还便于挑选良种，可谓“一举三得”。从去年春、夏以来，湖北省在全省广泛推广了这个办法，收到了很好的效果。去年10月份全省饲养母猪八十五万头，11月份迅速增长到九十五万头，一月之间增加了十万头母猪。咸丰县去年春天推广了尖山公社的“一产母猪”经验后，全县生猪繁殖直线上升，其中母猪平均每两户就有一头多，尖山、杨洞两个公社平均每户达到一头多母猪。远安县在五个月内，母猪增长一倍多，平均每月繁殖小猪由原来一千四百头猛增至六千二百二十五头，仔猪成活率也由原来74％提高到85％。汉阳县侏儒公社成功管理区原来只有二十头母猪，推行“一产母猪”后，迅速发展到一百一十六头，已产小猪一千二百多头，母猪较前增长四倍半，小猪增长十五倍半。
    各地实行这个办法，很快就解决了当地猪源供应问题，还支援了外县外社外队大量小猪，促进了养猪事业的全面发展。咸丰县尖山公社有“生猪之乡”之称，繁殖的小猪又好又多，附近许多地方都得到他们的支援。武汉市岱山公社英林生产队，通过“一产母猪”的办法，大力繁殖“武汉大白猪”（良种），几个月内由二百多头良种母猪增加到六百多头，除自繁自养外，还支援社内及社外三千八百四十二头小猪。
    湖北各地在大搞“一产母猪”的同时，逐步地扩充基本母猪群，普遍建立起四级繁殖场（即公社、管理区、生产队和小队），把从“一产母猪”中选出来的品种好、产仔多的优良母猪，交给繁殖场，实行专人饲养管理。宜昌县目前已建立起繁殖猪场四百多个。应山县有三个公社和二十个管理区的各级繁殖场，猪源问题基本解决后，开始向良种化的方向发展。
    湖北省各地正在推广先进配种经验，许多地方提出了大抓母猪满怀的“五全”（全留、全配、全怀、全产、全活）运动。远安县训练了二百五十名配种技术员，建立了一百七十六个配种技术指导站，使母猪配种和繁殖率大大提高。各地还实行了生猪繁殖的奖励制度，进一步激发饲养员和社员饲养母猪、加速繁殖的积极性。
    本报杭州8日电　浙江省黄岩县各人民公社积极扩大母猪群，采取领导干部、兽医和群众三结合的办法，逐栏逐头选留母猪，两个半月中，全县饲养的母猪猛增两倍半，从去年10月初的二万九千多头增加到九万八千多头。同时由于采取了各种先进配种办法，成年母猪全配全怀，繁殖小猪量显著增加，两个半月来，全县增养生猪六万多头。
    黄岩县在发展养猪事业中，大抓母猪培育，坚决贯彻自选、自育、自繁、自养的方针，克服猪源不足的困难，力争高速度发展养猪生产。中共黄岩县委提出了“见雌即留、先留后选、土中选良、逐步良种化”的口号，要求各地迅速扩大母猪群。各公社党委采取领导干部、兽医、群众三结合的办法，由公社党委书记、委员分工包干，带领大批兽医人员和养母猪有经验的社员，分头深入猪栏，逐栏逐头鉴定，把母猪全部选留下来，加以登记公布，禁止阉割。同时，为每头母猪建立了登记卡片，写明母猪的品种、年龄、配种时间和专管人员等，挂在栏前，以便掌握繁育情况和加强对母猪的管理。在选留母猪中，各公社对社员私养的部分母猪，以等价交换的原则进行调剂，把母猪集中到社、队的养猪场或种猪场饲养。
    黄岩县采取这些措施以后，母猪激增。现在，全县平均每三头左右的生猪中就有一头母猪。全县十六万多户社员，平均每两户养母猪一头。很多公社、生产队平均每户社员饲养母猪超过一头。
    在迅速扩大母猪群同时，黄岩县各公社开展了以全配、全怀、全产、全活、全壮为中心内容的全配满怀运动，普遍推行了双重配、重复配和人工授精等先进配种方法，提高成年母猪的繁殖率和仔猪成活率。全县建立了一百二十五个人工授精站，普遍采取人工授精、多次输精办法，提高良种公猪的利用率。全县成年母猪除了带仔猪的以外，满怀率达到95％以上。许多母猪多胎高产，一年三胎，一胎产小猪二十多只。（附图片）
