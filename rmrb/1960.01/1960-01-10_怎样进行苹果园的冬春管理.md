How to Manage Apple Orchards in Winter and Spring
Liaoning Xiong Yue Agricultural Science Research Institute

Under the deep concern of the Party since liberation, China's fruit tree production has been rapidly restored and developed, the number of fruit trees has increased year by year, and the output has continued to rise. In 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, a situation of great leap forward emerged in agricultural production, and China's fruit tree planting area also developed greatly. Last year's fruit tree production saw a new leap forward on the basis of the previous year. In order to better protect these newly planted small trees and the original large trees to safely overwinter and grow vigorously in the spring, thereby ensuring a significant increase in the yield and quality of fruit trees this year, it is necessary to carry out a series of management tasks in winter and spring. Various fruit trees (including different tree species and varieties) react differently to low temperatures due to the different morphological formation conditions in their phylogenetic process. Various varieties of fruit trees, not only in cold regions, but even in cultivated regions suitable for their growth and development, often suffer from varying degrees of frost damage in unsuitable years. Fruit trees are perennial woody plants. Although they enter a dormant state in winter, they are still living organisms and need a certain amount of nutrients. In early spring, when the root system begins to be active, but the soil has not completely thawed, a large amount of nutrients is needed to accumulate in the body to enhance tree vigor.

In winter, some diseases and insect pests lurk on the tree or in the orchard to overwinter. During this period, diseases and insects are generally in a static state and easy to eliminate; fruit trees are also in a state of slow growth and dormancy, and have strong resistance to medicines. High-concentration or mineral oil-based agents can be used to control pests. Based on the above situation, and the characteristics of more autumn rain, early cold, and more overwintering diseases and insects in the north last year, it is necessary to carry out many technical management measures in winter to reduce the adverse effects of low temperatures on fruit trees, enhance tree nutrition, eliminate overwintering diseases and insects, and ensure a greater bumper harvest in 1960.

   I. Protect the tree body. Last autumn, the rainfall in the north was large, and the land froze early, so frost prevention is of special significance. There are several ways to prevent frost: (1) Whitewash coating: Use twenty catties of quicklime and two catties of salt, mixed with water into a viscous state, and apply it to the trunk. (2) Wrap the trunk: Use rice straw or wheat straw to tie the trunk and the crotch of the main branches. This method can be used for young trees where whitewash is not easy to stick or in areas with abundant straw sources. (3) Cover the trunk with soil: First wrap the trunk according to the above method, and then cover it with a soil pile of one to one and a half feet high. (4) Apply protective agent: In areas where rodent damage is serious in winter, rodent repellent such as lime-sulfur mixture should be applied to the trunks of tree species that do not need frost protection to prevent rodent damage.

   II. Strengthen field management: (1) Do a good job of winter irrigation, spring irrigation, and moisture conservation: In arid areas in spring, ice should be hauled into the orchard to accumulate water, or winter irrigation, spring irrigation, and plowing and hoeing should be carried out immediately after thawing. These are all methods of drought prevention and moisture conservation. (2) Careful pruning: Pruning can enable young trees to grow according to people's requirements, enable trees in their prime to grow a large number of preparatory fruiting branches and produce abundant yields year after year; and make old trees grow vigorously locally and rejuvenate. Therefore, it is necessary to prune according to the biological characteristics of various fruit trees and the specific growth conditions of the year. When pruning small trees, special attention should be paid to shaping and promoting early fruiting; trees in the prime of fruit bearing should retain an appropriate density of branches, retain more inner-lying branches, make good use of drooping branches and supporting branches, and pay attention to the renewal of fruit branches. Old trees should be appropriately shortened to stimulate their vigorous growth. (3) Build soil and water conservation projects in orchards: In winter, there are fewer activities in the orchard. You can seize the opportunity to use the soil transfer method to repair the terraces and ditches of the sloping orchard and other soil and water conservation projects to prevent soil erosion and improve soil fertility.

   III. Prevention and control of diseases and insect pests: Winter is the dormant period for diseases and insects, and it is also a favorable period for eliminating diseases and insects. We should seize the good opportunity to encircle and suppress the diseases and insect pests lurking in the orchard. (1) Do a good job of "three cleans". Clean the trees: In winter, many diseases and insects, such as winter small peach fruit borer, leaf roller larvae, red spider and hairy caterpillar eggs, overwinter under the old bark and raised bark on the trees, so it is necessary to carefully scrape off the old bark and raised bark and burn them immediately. Diseases and injuries on the trees, such as canker, should also be scraped clean, disinfected after scraping, and coated with asphalt, lead oil, and other substances to protect the wounds. In combination with pruning, diseased and dead branches and branches with insect eggs should also be cut off and burned. Clean the ground under the trees: Dead branches, fallen leaves, weeds, and fallen fruits in the orchard should also be thoroughly swept away and burned. The hanging branch poles of fruit trees should also be scalded with boiling water, and the straw ropes used for hanging branches should be burned. Clean the edge of the orchard: Remove weeds on the edge of the orchard, and seal the cracks in the dikes of terraces with lime and yellow mud to prevent overwintering pests from flying out in the following spring to cause harm. (2) Spray anthracene oil emulsion: In order to eliminate scale insects, red spiders, and other pests lurking on the trunk for overwintering, it is best to spray a 5% anthracene oil emulsion once before the fruit trees germinate to prevent the spread of insect pests after the fruit trees germinate.

    怎样进行苹果园的冬春管理
    辽宁熊岳农业科学研究所
    解放后在党的深切关怀下，我国的果树生产得到迅速地恢复发展，果树株数逐年增加，产量不断上升。1958年在总路线的光辉照耀下，农业生产出现了大跃进的形势，我国的果树栽种面积也有很大发展。去年的果树生产，在前年的基础上又有了新的跃进。为了更好的保护这些新栽培的小树和原有的大树安全越冬，春季生长旺盛，从而保证今年果树产量和质量的大大提高，必须在冬春两季作好一系列的管理工作。各种果树（包括不同的树种和品种），由于它们在系统发育过程中的形态形成条件不同，所以它们对低温的反应也不相同，各种品种的果树，不仅在寒冷地区，就是在适于它们生长发育的栽培的地区，也往往会在不适宜的年度里，遭受不同程度的冻害。果树是多年生的木本植物，冬季虽然进入了休眠状态，但依然是生活着的机体，还需要一定的营养物质。在早春根系开始活动，而土地尚未完全解冻的时候，则需要大量的营养物质，蓄积体内，以增强树势。
    冬季有些病虫害，潜伏在树体上或果园中越冬。在这个时期，病虫一般都处于静止状态，易于消灭；果树也处于生长迟缓和休眠状态，对药剂的抵抗能力较强，可以用高浓度或矿物性油类的药剂防治害虫。根据上述情况，和去年北方秋雨多、冷得早和越冬病虫较多等特点，有必要在冬季进行许多技术管理，以减弱低温对果树不利的影响，增强树体营养，消灭越冬病虫，保证1960年更大的丰收。
    一、保护树体。去秋北方降雨量大、土地封冻早、预防冻害有特殊意义。防冻的方法有这样几种：①抹白涂剂：用生石灰二十斤、食盐二斤，掺水调成粘稠状，抹在树干上。（2）包扎树干：用稻草或麦秸在树干和主枝分杈处捆绑起来。一般白涂剂不易粘着的幼树或草源丰富的地区可用这个办法。（3）在树干周围培土：先按上面的办法把树干包扎，再培上一至一尺五寸高的土堆。（4）涂保护剂：在冬季鼠害严重的地方，对不需防寒的树种应在干部涂上石灰硫磺合剂之类的驱避剂，防止鼠害。
    二、加强田间管理：（1）作好冬灌春灌和保墒：在春季干旱地区，要往果园中拉冰积水、或冬灌、春灌和解冻后立即耕锄。这些都是防旱保墒的办法。（2）细致修剪：修剪可以使幼树按人们的要求成长，使盛期的树生长大量预备结果枝，年年丰产；使老树局部生长旺盛，返老还童。为此必须根据各种果树的生物学特性和当年生长的具体情况因树修剪。小树在修剪时要特别注意整枝和促进提早结果；盛果期的树要适当密留枝条，多留内趟枝，很好利用下垂枝和扶养枝，注意果枝的更新。老树要适当短截，以刺激其生长旺盛。（3）兴修果园水土保持工程：冬季果园活动较少，可抓时机用移土法把倾斜地果园的梯田和撩壕等水土保持工程修好，以防止水土流失，提高土壤肥力。
    三、防治病虫害：冬季是病虫休眠期，也是消灭病虫的有利时期，应该抓住良好时机，围歼果园中潜藏的病虫害。（1）作好“三净”。树上净：冬季有不少病虫，如冬小食心虫、卷叶幼虫、红蜘蛛和毛虫卵等都在树上的老皮和翘皮下越冬，所以要认真的刮去老皮和翘皮并立即烧掉。树上的病伤如腐烂病等也要刮净，并在刮后消毒和涂上沥青、铅油等保护伤口。结合修剪还要把病枯枝和带有虫卵的枝条剪除烧掉。树下净：果园里的枯枝、落叶、杂草和落果等也要彻底扫除烧掉。果树的吊枝杆子也要用开水烫好，吊枝用的草绳要烧掉。园边净：除去园边杂草，梯田堤坝的裂缝用石灰和黄泥封闭，防止越冬害虫在翌春飞出为害。（2）喷射蒽油乳剂：为消灭在树干上潜伏越冬的介壳虫、红蜘蛛等害虫，最好在果树发芽以前喷射一次5％的蒽油乳剂，以防止果树发芽后虫害蔓延。
