Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, 29th. Zhu Ziqi, Secretary-General of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, handed over copies of the two resolutions passed at the "Congo Day" held in Beijing last November and at the mass rally in support of the Congo's struggle for independence held last January, respectively, to Ilio, Director of the Political Bureau of the Congolese National Movement Party, and his delegation, Raymond, Secretary-General of the Congolese Abako Party, and his delegation, and Kitima, Secretary-General of the Congolese National Workers' Union. They are here attending the Second All-African People's Conference.

Zhu Ziqi, on behalf of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, expressed to them that the Chinese people support the Congolese people's struggle against colonialism and imperialism, and asked them to convey the above resolutions to the Congolese people.

The Congolese leaders expressed their gratitude to the Chinese people for their friendly support and assured that they would convey the wishes of the Chinese people to the Congolese people. They said that they were very happy to meet with representatives from China, because in the past, the imperialists always tried to separate them from the Chinese people. They also said, "We, the Congolese people, are closely watching every achievement made by the Chinese people in their struggle."

    中国人民支持刚果人民斗争
    朱子奇把我国人民两项决议交给刚果民族运动党领袖
    新华社突尼斯29日电　中国亚非团结委员会秘书长朱子奇在这里把去年11月在北京举行的“刚果日”和去年1月举行的支持刚果争取独立的群众大会上分别通过的两项决议的副本，交给刚果民族运动党政治局主任伊利奥和他的代表团、刚果阿巴科党总书记雷蒙和他的代表团以及刚果全国工人联合会总书记基蒂马。他们正在这里参加第二届全非人民大会。
    朱子奇代表中国亚非团结委员会向他们表示，中国人民支持刚果人民反对殖民主义和帝国主义的斗争，并且要求他们把上述决议转达刚果人民。
    刚果领袖们表示感谢中国人民对他们的友好支持，并且保证把中国人民的意愿转达给刚果人民。他们表示，他们能够同来自中国的代表见面，感到十分高兴，因为在过去，帝国主义者总是设法把他们同中国人民分开。他们还说，“我们刚果人民密切注视着中国人民在斗争中所取得的每一个成就”。
