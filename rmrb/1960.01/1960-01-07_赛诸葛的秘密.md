The Lotus Peak and Tongxi River echo with mountain songs and fishermen's tunes; the scenery is beautiful, with peach blossoms in full bloom and lush green hills. There is a sanatorium here, where most of the residents are heroic model workers. One day, a group of people arrived, beating drums and gongs, led by a young man, holding letters of commendation and good news in his hands. One master craftsman tried to hide as soon as he saw the group, quietly retreating into a small building. Outside, the noise was loud and lively, and Secretary Feng's booming voice shook the air: "Who are we delivering the good news to? Uh, what's his name? How do you know he's in this sanatorium? Oh, the name of the sanatorium is printed on his shirt." "Yes, please come to the office and sit down, I guarantee you'll find this master craftsman." Five days ago, on Monday, the moon was already setting in the west, pine trees rustled in the evening breeze, and sparse stars twinkled as the lights went out. Only one person was still awake, studying blueprints with a pen in hand. It was "Living Zhuge Liang," working on a design to improve equipment and produce more small generators. See how he takes off his glasses and puts them back on again, it looks like he's encountered a problem. Suddenly, he punches the table and jumps up, chuckling, his laughter shaking his side whiskers. He quickly grabs his pen and sits back on his wooden chair, it looks like he's solved that problem. After drawing the last stroke, he exhales a long breath, and at this moment, the sound of a rooster crowing is heard in the distance. "Living Zhuge Liang," with a smile on his face,
  Takes the design back to the factory, full of glee,
  The reporter's bicycle is leaning against the wall,
  He gets on and speeds away immediately.
  "Living Zhuge Liang's" cycling skills aren't good, he falls four or five times along the way.
  He's covered in sweat,
  Suddenly he sees a figure ahead,
  He wants to stop, but it's too late!
  This is going to be bad!
  In the nick of time,
  They crash, both falling to the ground.
  He thought the man would start to argue,
  But after waiting a long time, everything is quiet.
  He sees the man lying on the ground, seemingly dazed,
  Looking intently at the blueprint.
  "Living Zhuge Liang" is baffled,
  Could he have a concussion and a fever?! "Living Zhuge Liang," is surprised,
  The young man jumps up and pulls him up:
  "Master, did you draw this blueprint?
  Solving the key depends on it;
  Our factory is in Chaoyangba,
  My name is Du Zhenghua,
  To support rural electrification, the task of making generators is important, and not a single one can be missed! But we ran into a difficulty that we couldn't overcome, and we were anxious!
  This blueprint is a treasure, with it we can complete the task perfectly." As he speaks, he looks at it reluctantly, and "Living Zhuge Liang" keeps scratching his head. He waves his hand and says: "How about this, let's both go to your factory to find a solution." The two happily head straight for Chaoyangba, and along the way, "Living Zhuge Liang" keeps laughing. Their steps are tight, quick as the wind, and they head towards the morning glow; they run ten miles in one breath, and Du Zhenghua is excited and flushed. The workers are touched when they hear the news, and surround the master craftsman. After looking at the blueprint, everyone says it's very useful, and they immediately start improving the equipment. In the mid-afternoon, the workshop is filled with cheers, it goes without saying that the improved equipment is successful. While everyone is crowding around the machine, he slips out of the workshop and runs away quickly. He never expected that people would come to deliver the good news today, and "Living Zhuge Liang" hid in the small attic. Today is Saturday, and the sanatorium is holding an evening party with performances. Although "Living Zhuge Liang" is already fifty-five years old, he loves to sing Peking Opera and tell stories. This evening, he is going to tell the story of Wu Song fighting the tiger, and he feels a little unwell before going on stage, but he hopes that the young man has already returned "home," and "Living Zhuge Liang" walks out with a bit of unease. His first pose is very imposing, and with the striking of the gavel, the audience applauds endlessly as he recites the four lines of poetry, his vivid and detailed description is truly excellent. He is just telling the story of Wu Song hitting the old pine tree with his staff, and the white-browed tiger is pouncing on the hero; when suddenly someone hugs him tightly around the neck, scaring him into a sweat. He turns around and sees that it's none other than Xiao Du, who is affectionately calling him Master Luo. He says that he has also found some new ways to improve things, and wants to exchange experiences with his master urgently, he insists on pulling him off the stage against his will, and "Living Zhuge Liang" is so happy that he forgets to tell the story. Secretary Feng hurries onto the stage to explain the reason, and in an instant, applause thunders mixed with cheers. The entertainment party turns into an experience exchange meeting, and a wonderful program is added to the evening party.

    赛诸葛的秘密
    （四川车灯）　王燮莲花峰、桐溪河，阵阵山歌应渔歌；山明水秀真不错，春满桃林绿满坡。这里有个疗养所，休养员大半是英雄劳模。这一天来了人一伙，又打鼓来又敲锣，领头的是一个青年小伙，表扬信和喜报手里捧着。有位师傅一见来人就开躲，阴悄悄缩进小楼阁。听外面人声嚷嚷闹热不过，冯书记那大喉咙声音震耳朵：“喜报送给哪一个？呃，不知他姓甚么来叫甚么？你为啥又晓得他在本所？呵，所名字在他的上衣印着。“对，你们请到办公室里坐一坐，我包你把这位师傅找着。”五天前，星期一，月亮已往西山移，松涛阵阵晚风里，疏星点点灯亮熄。只有一人还没睡，面对图纸手执笔。原来是赛诸葛正搞设计，改进设备多生产小型发电机。你看他取下眼镜又戴起，看样子是碰到一点难题。忽然间他桌上一拳一跃而起，嘿嘿笑声震动了络腮胡须。赶快又抓起笔来坐上木椅，看样子是解决了那点难题。画完了最后一笔呼口长气，这时候远远传来一声鸡啼。赛诸葛，满脸笑，
  送图回厂兴致高，
  通讯员的自行车正在屋角靠，
  ?出门骑上就开“镖”。
  赛诸葛骑车技术本不好，一路上连跌四五跤。
  正搞得一身大汗冒，
  忽见前面人影一条，
  想停车，来不及了！
  这一下，要糟糕！
  说时迟来那时快，
  碰上去两人都跌一大跤。
  他以为那人要大吵大闹，
  谁知等了好一阵静静悄悄。
  见那人伏在地上像是迷了窍，
  捧着那张图纸专心瞧。
  赛诸葛倒弄得莫名其妙，
  莫非他震伤脑膜在发烧？！赛诸葛，正惊诧，
  那青年跳起身来把他拉：
  “老师傅，这图纸是不是您画？
  解决关键要靠它；
  我们厂就在朝阳坝，
  我名就叫杜正华，
  为支援农村电气化，发电机任务重一架不能差！偏遇着难关攻不垮，急得人心头像猫抓！
  这图纸是宝贝一点不假，有了它完成任务顶呱呱。一边说一边看舍不得放下，赛诸葛不住在抓头发。手一挥他说：“这样吧，我两个同去你厂想办法。”两个人欢欢喜喜直奔朝阳坝，一路上赛诸葛不住在打哈哈。脚步紧，快如风，迎着朝霞往前冲；十里路一气就跑拢，杜正华兴奋得满脸通红。工人们听到消息谁不感动，把老师傅围了个水泄不通。看了图大家都说很合用，改进设备立马就动工。半下午车间里欢声雷动，不消说是改进设备已成功。趁众人都在往机器前拥，他溜出车间跑了个急匆匆。想不到今天人家来把喜报送，赛诸葛才躲进小阁楼中。今天正逢星期六，疗养所里开晚会要演节目。赛诸葛虽说已满五十五，爱唱西皮二簧还爱说评书。这晚上他要说武松打虎，出台前心头有点不舒服，但愿那个小伙子已经回“府”，赛诸葛丢丢心心来走出，头一个架势就很威武，跟倒一拍惊堂木，四句诗一出口掌声不住，绘声绘色真不含糊。正说到武松哨棒打上老松树，白额猛虎正把英雄扑；忽然间颈项被人紧紧抱住，倒把他吓出了一脸汗珠。回头一看不是别人正是小杜，亲亲热热在喊罗师傅，他说他也找到了一点新门路，要跟师傅交流经验时间急促，硬要把他拉下台去不由分诉，赛诸葛高兴得忘了说评书。冯书记忙上台细说原故，一霎时掌声如雷夹着欢呼。文娱会变成了经验交流会，晚会上增加一个精采节目。
