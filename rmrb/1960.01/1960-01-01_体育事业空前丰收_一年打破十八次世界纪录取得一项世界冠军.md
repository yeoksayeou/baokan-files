Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In 1959, China's mass sports activities achieved great success in both popularization and improvement. Athletes broke world records a total of eighteen times, tied one world record, and won a world championship. China's sports endeavors resolutely implemented the Party's policy, actively strengthening the people's physique and enabling sports to serve labor production and national defense construction. As a result, mass sports activities across the country developed more vigorously than in previous years. Recently, the winter sports activities launched across the country have formed a mass movement of enormous scale. Indoors and outdoors, on ice rinks, running tracks, and sports grounds, tens of thousands of people are participating in various sports activities they enjoy. In the table tennis sport alone, some cities have seen participation exceeding 100,000 people.

Over the past year, workplace exercises, pre- and post-labor exercises, field exercises, and the "Labor and Defense System" (a physical fitness program) have greatly developed. The vast majority of students in universities and middle schools across the country have passed the "Labor and Defense System" exercise standards. Competition activities in various sports projects in factories, mines, enterprises, government agencies, and schools have also been extremely active.

The rapid growth of young athletes is a major feature of the development of China's sports in 1959. The widespread establishment of amateur youth sports schools has cultivated many excellent athletes for the country. The Chinese Table Tennis B Team, composed entirely of young players, has achieved increasingly good results in international competitions in Hungary, the United Kingdom, and Sweden.

In 1959, the improvement of technical levels in China's various sports developed rapidly, making continuous leaps forward. During this year, athletes broke world records a total of eighteen times, which is more than double the eight times achieved in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.

In the autumn of 1959, the First National Games held in China, including forty-two events, concentratedly reflected the significant improvement in the level of sports in China based on the widespread development of mass sports activities. More than 50 million people across the country participated in the selection competitions at all levels for this National Games. During the Games, more than 10,000 athletes from more than twenty ethnic groups broke four world records, broke 106 national records in single events, or created new national achievements more than 800 times.

During this year, China's young athletes participated in more than 130 international sports activities, exceeding any previous year. They achieved better results than in previous years, winning honor for the motherland. Twenty-one-year-old table tennis player Rong Guotuan won the World Table Tennis Championships in Dortmund, becoming the first world champion in the history of Chinese sports.

    体育事业空前丰收
    一年打破十八次世界纪录取得一项世界冠军
    据新华社讯　1959年，我国群众性体育运动无论在普及和提高方面，都取得了很大成就。运动员们在这一年一共十八次突破世界纪录，平了一项世界纪录，并取得了一项世界锦标赛的冠军。我国的体育事业坚决贯彻了党的方针，积极增强人民体质，使体育运动为劳动生产和国防建设服务，因此1959年全国各地群众性体育运动比往年开展得更加蓬勃。最近以来，全国各地掀起的冬季体育锻炼活动，已经形成了规模巨大的群众运动，室内、室外，冰场、跑道、体育场所，有成千上万的人参加他们所喜爱的各种体育活动。其中仅乒乓球运动一项，有些城市参加的人数就超过了十万人。
    一年来，工间操、劳动前后操、田间操和“劳卫制”锻炼都有很大发展。全国大、中学校学生，绝大部分通过了“劳卫制”锻炼标准。厂矿、企业、机关、学校等单位的各种体育运动项目的竞赛活动，也极为活跃。
    广大青少年运动员的迅速地成长，是1959年我国体育事业发展过程中的一大特点。青少年业余体育学校的广泛建立，为国家培养了不少优秀运动员。全部由年轻选手组成的中国乒乓球乙队，不久前在访问匈牙利、英国和瑞典的国际比赛中，取得了越来越好的战绩。
    1959年内，我国各项体育运动技术水平的提高，日新月异，不断跃进。这一年中，运动员们共十八次打破世界纪录，这比大跃进的1958年中八次打破世界纪录又多了一倍以上。
    1959年秋天，我国举行的包括四十二个项目的第一届全国运动会，集中地反映了我国体育运动水平在群众性体育活动广泛开展的基础上，有显著的提高。这次全运会，全国共有五千多万人参加了各级的选拔赛。运动会举行期间，一万多名包括二十多个民族的运动员，共打破了四项世界纪录、八百多次打破了一百零六个单项全国纪录或创造了全国新成绩。
    这一年中，我国年轻的体育运动员参加国际体育活动来往一百三十多次，超过了以往任何一年。他们取得比往年更好的成绩，为祖国争得了荣誉。二十一岁的乒乓球选手容国团，在多特蒙德赢得了世界乒乓球锦标赛的冠军，成为我国体育运动史上的第一个世界冠军。
