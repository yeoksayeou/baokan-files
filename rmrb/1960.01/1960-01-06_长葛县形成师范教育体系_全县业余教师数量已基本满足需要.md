    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 5th: Changge County, Henan Province, has achieved excellent results in training and improving the skills of middle and primary school teachers throughout the county. Approximately 98% of the county's more than 1,500 public middle and primary school teachers and nearly 10,000 non-detachment production part-time school teachers have participated in various forms of normal schools and correspondence organizations, forming a normal education system from top to bottom throughout the county.

    The Changge County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to systematically cultivate and improve the professional skills of middle and primary school teachers throughout the county and improve the quality of teaching, has strengthened its leadership over this work. Relevant departments of the county have concentrated more than a dozen instructors with junior college level or above to establish the county's correspondence station and lecture group, regularly touring the rural areas of the county to systematically teach primary school teachers the courses of junior normal school. The county's three public middle schools, under the instructions of the county party committee, established three guidance points including principals, teaching directors, and outstanding teachers, and conducted teaching guidance to primary school teachers and teachers of private middle schools within the guidance points every week, to understand the various problems they had encountered in teaching during the week, and to help teachers of private middle schools prepare lessons, etc. The county's correspondence station also provided special guidance to outstanding primary school teachers who already had a junior normal school level, to help them solve special difficulties in their studies. After three years of guidance, these teachers have now been added to the ranks of middle school teachers.

    Eighty of the county's more than two hundred middle school teachers are participating in the province's higher correspondence schools. The county party committee and the county's correspondence station also organized the remaining one hundred middle school teachers, delimited guidance points, and contacted the provincial correspondence schools to provide them with the same lectures, and the county conducted guidance. In addition, the county high school also attached a normal school class. After several years of training and improvement, after a rigorous graduation examination in 1958, more than 98% of the county's primary school teachers reached the level of junior normal school or junior high school, and the county's public middle school teachers have also reached the level of senior normal school or senior high school education.

    The county's work in cultivating and improving part-time teachers has been particularly remarkable. At present, the number of part-time teachers needed in the county has basically solved the problem, and it is also training teachers for future part-time middle schools. The people's communes in the county have established thirty-nine Red and Expert Normal Schools, and the 2,400 students are all students with senior primary school and junior high school education levels or young farmers equivalent to this level. They are preparing to serve as teachers in part-time middle schools after three years of study. Party organizations of various production brigades have also adopted different methods to train part-time teachers. For example, they concentrate a group of teachers and use three, five, or a week's time, combined with on-site meetings of advanced evening schools, to focus on solving problems such as teaching methods and teaching attitudes, or systematically teach cultural courses to part-time teachers at guidance points every Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning.

    The Changge County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to the political and ideological work among teachers. The party schools run by the county party committee and the party committees of various people's communes absorb party member responsible cadres of middle and primary schools to participate in learning in each issue. At present, party and league members account for more than 60% of the county's more than 1,500 public middle and primary school teachers.

    长葛县形成师范教育体系
    全县业余教师数量已基本满足需要
    新华社郑州5日电　河南省长葛县在培养和提高全县中、小学教师方面，做出了很好的成绩。全县一千五百多名公立中、小学教师和近万名不脱产的业余学校的教师，98％左右参加了不同形式的师范学校和函授组织，全县自上而下地形成了一套师范教育体系。
    中共长葛县委会为系统地培养和提高全县中、小学教师的业务水平，提高教学质量，加强了对这项工作的领导。县的有关部门，集中十几名专科以上水平的教员，成立县的函授站和讲师团，定期巡回全县农村，向小学教师系统地讲授初级师范的课程。全县三所公立中学，根据县委指示，成立了包括校长、教导主任和优秀教师在内的三个辅导点，每周分别向辅导点以内的小学教师和民办中学的教师，进行教学方面的辅导，了解他们一周来在教学上产生的各种问题，帮助民办中学的教师进行备课等。县的函授站还对已经具备初级师范水平的优秀小学教师，加以特别的辅导，帮助他们解决学习中的特别困难。经过三年辅导，现在这些教师都已补充到中学教师队伍里。
    全县二百多名中学教师，有八十名参加省的高等函授学校。县委和县的函授站把其余的一百多名中学教师，也组织起来，划定辅导点，并和省级函授学校取得联系，供给他们同样的讲义，由县里进行辅导。另外，县立高中又附设了师范班。经几年来的培养和提高，1958年经过严格的毕业考试，全县小学教师98％以上达到初级师范或初中水平，县公立中学教师也已达到高师或高中文化水平。
    这个县培养提高业余教师的工作成绩尤为显著，目前全县需要的业余教师在数量上已经基本解决问题，而且正在为今后业余中学培养教员。全县人民公社举办了三十九所红专师范，两千四百名学员都是高小和初中文化水平的学生或相当于这个水平的青年农民，他们准备经三年学习，毕业后担任业余中学教师。各生产大队党组织也采取不同方法，培养业余教师。如集中一批教师，利用三、五天或一个星期的时间，结合先进夜校现场会，着重解决教学方法和教学态度等问题，或者每星期六下午或星期日上午，按辅导点向业余教师系统地讲授文化课程。
    中共长葛县委非常重视教师中的政治思想工作。县委和各人民公社党委举办的党校，每期都分别吸收中、小学校的党员负责干部参加学习。现在全县一千五百多名公立中、小学教师中，党、团员占60％以上。
