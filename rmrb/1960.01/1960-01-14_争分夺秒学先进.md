Since the Great Leap Forward, the idea of striving for high speed has been like a red thread running through all areas of national construction, economic life, leadership methods, and people's thinking.

Last year, the Hongqi Chemical Plant in Heilongjiang Province created a new power distribution method called "simplified, boosted voltage, ring power supply." This method is economical, reasonable, and safe, and can save a large amount of electrical equipment. The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately instructed relevant departments to try out and promote it and explore its experience. In the process of promotion, the Harbin Electric Wire Factory, combined with the actual situation of the factory, summed up a relatively complete set of experiences. Recently, this experience has had a new major development. From a unified power supply for power and lighting in one factory and a ring power supply between workshops, it has developed into a "four-in-one" ring power supply in the Nanmalu area of Harbin. From this example, we can see that, in the situation of the Great Leap Forward, advanced experience has developed so quickly and been promoted so quickly, which cannot but be the result of the general line and high-speed thinking deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

We must change the face of "poverty and blankness" as soon as possible and build our country into an advanced socialist power. There is no place where speed is not needed. In order to develop productive forces at high speed, every minute and every second is precious, and we should strive to advance whenever possible. In learning and promoting advanced experience, we should also have this spirit of "seizing every minute." All advanced experience that can be applied in the unit and region should be promoted and applied as soon as possible. Advanced experience is a concrete measure for developing productive forces at high speed. The faster we learn it, the earlier its role will be brought into play; the wider it is promoted, the greater its value will be. A worker put it well: "High quality and high yield are like fruits, and advanced experience is the ladder. If you want to pick fruits, you can't do without a ladder." Countless examples show that the more advanced experience we learn and the faster we promote it, the faster and better the national plan will be completed. Some advanced experiences, such as the ring power supply experience, may seem to have a less obvious and urgent relationship with a unit completing the national plan, but a little thought will reveal the economic significance of this advanced experience. It is said that the universal promotion of the "simplified, boosted voltage, ring power supply" experience in Harbin will save 5.2 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, remove 11,740 kVA transformers and 80,000 meters of electric wire, which can basically solve the problem of rural electricity consumption in the suburbs of Harbin. Just imagine how great the economic and political significance this has for promoting the development of production and supporting rural electrification!

Striving for high speed is inseparable from mass technological innovation and from the leadership's vigorous promotion of advanced experience. If we are sensitive to discovering new things and vigorously support new things, our speed of progress will be faster.

    争分夺秒学先进
    黎夫
    大跃进以来，力争高速度的思想，就像一根红线似地贯穿在国家建设、经济生活、领导方法和人民思想的各个领域。
    去年，黑龙江省内红旗化工厂创造了一种新的配电方法，名叫“简化、升压、环形供电”。这种方法，既经济、合理和安全，又能节约大量的电气设备。中共黑龙江省委立即指示各有关部门试行推广和摸索经验。在推广过程中，哈尔滨电线厂又结合本厂实际情况，总结出了较为完整的成套经验。最近这个经验又有了新的重大发展。由一个厂内动力与照明用电合一、车间之间的环形供电，发展到哈尔滨南马路地区一个地区的“四合一”环形供电。从这一事例中，可以看到，先进经验在大跃进的形势下，发展的如此之快，推广的如此之快，不能不是总路线高速度的思想深入人心的结果。
    我们要尽快地改变“一穷二白”的面貌，把我国建设成为一个先进的社会主义强国，无处不需要快。为了高速地发展生产力，一分一秒的时间都是宝贵的，能够提前一分一秒，就要力争提前。在学习和推广先进经验方面，也应当有这种“争分夺秒”的精神。凡是能够在本单位和本地区应用的先进经验，就应当尽快地推广应用。先进经验是高速度地发展生产力的具体措施，学习得愈快，它的作用便愈早地发挥；推广得愈广，它的价值便愈大。有个工人说得好：“优质高产好比是果子，先进经验是阶梯，要想摘果子，没有梯子不行。”无数的事例说明：先进经验学习得越多，推广得越快，国家计划便会完成得越快、越好。有一些先进经验，如环形供电的经验，初看起来，好像同一个单位完成国家计划的关系不是那么明显、紧迫，但稍加思索，就会发现这种先进经验的经济意义。据说“简化、升压、环形供电”的经验在哈尔滨全市普遍推行的结果，一年能节省五百二十万度电，能拆掉一万一千七百四十千伏安变压器、八万米电线，可以基本上解决哈尔滨市郊区的农村用电问题。试想这对促进生产的发展，支援农村的电气化，有着多么大的经济意义和政治意义啊！
    力争高速度是同群众性的技术革新分不开的，是同领导上大力推广先进经验分不开的。敏感地发现新鲜事物，并且大力地支持新鲜事物，我们的前进速度就会更快。
