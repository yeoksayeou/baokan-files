Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 7th - The finance and banking departments of Jiangyou County, Sichuan Province, are fully dedicated to serving production, becoming a model in Sichuan's finance and banking work. In 1959, they adhered to the principle of putting politics in command, launched mass movements, proceeded from production in everything, actively participated in and organized production, and outstandingly supported the great development of industry and agriculture, while also overfulfilling all their own tasks.

In 1959, industrial and agricultural production in Jiangyou County developed rapidly, placing higher and greater demands on finance and banking work. In response to this new situation, the finance and banking departments conducted education among all employees to vigorously support industrial and agricultural production and accumulate construction funds for the country. This was followed by a mass movement to support communes in developing agricultural production, assist poor teams in catching up with rich teams, and act as advisors to industrial and mining enterprises, offering advice, establishing broad connections, and providing assistance in various ways.

When the spring plowing began last year, the Jiangyou County branch of the People's Bank of China, in order to support agricultural production in a timely manner, first overcame the "three waiting" mentalities of cadres in issuing agricultural loans, namely, waiting for the production season, waiting for the communes to prepare plans, and waiting for the supply and marketing cooperatives to begin supplying agricultural production materials. They proposed "three initiatives," namely, proactively consulting with the communes, proactively helping the communes prepare production and financial plans, and proactively delivering funds to their doorsteps. They sent working groups to the communes to cultivate agricultural loan "experimental plots." Through pilot projects, they proposed a set of methods: "one check, two sends, three manufactures" (i.e., check the needs and timing of production materials of the communes and brigades, check the existing inventory of production materials of the commercial departments, and check the material potential of the communes and brigades; send production materials, fertilizers, and loans; assist the communes in establishing fertilizer, farm tool, pesticide, and feed factories) and "combining the manufacture, repair, and maintenance of farm tools." They reported this to the Party committee, which organized the relevant departments to implement it together. After adopting the three initiatives and this series of working methods, the national investment, agricultural loans, and commune production plans were combined, and the agricultural loans and the supply of production materials were combined, achieving a situation where loans were based on actual needs and used where they were most needed. After all preparatory work was completed, the financial and trade departments, under the leadership of the Party committee, closely cooperated and acted in a unified manner. The finance department issued investments, the bank and credit cooperatives issued loans, and the supply and marketing cooperatives supplied materials, so that the production teams received funds and production materials in a timely manner. Last year, agricultural loans were basically issued by the end of March, ahead of the production season, ensuring that no time was lost in agricultural work.

In addition to loans, the bank, based on the principle of running the communes diligently and thriftily, assisted the communes in building and expanding 351 farm tool factories and more than 1,500 fertilizer factories, making their own farm tools and fertilizers. Starting from arranging the economic life of the masses, they actively absorbed idle funds scattered among the masses and used them for production. They set up savings groups in the people's commune canteens, helped the masses arrange their lives, handled savings business, assisted production teams in organizing members to develop diversified operations, and assisted canteens in improving accounting, becoming a good form of organizing the economic life of the masses. Due to the widespread establishment of savings groups, last year the county's rural savings plan was overfulfilled by 24% six months ahead of schedule. Based on the experience of establishing savings groups in canteens, the bank further established 41 savings offices and 110 agency offices in factories and mines, expanding the savings business.

In March of last year, the Jiangyou County Party Committee, based on the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, called on the finance and banking departments to actively support poor teams and help them catch up with rich teams. The employees of the finance and banking departments put forward the slogan "Take the poor teams as our home, and we will definitely turn them into rich teams." The county branch bank transferred 71 bank and credit cooperative cadres to participate in production in the poor teams, helping them plan funds, grasp the key to production, and develop diversified operations. Through pilot work and investigation and research, based on the principle of "self-reliance as the main factor and state assistance as a supplementary factor," they proposed the method of "three same, four guarantees, and one through-to-the-end" to help the poor teams catch up with the rich teams, so as to achieve "four mores, six goods, and two no lacks." The three sames are: eat, live, and labor together; the four guarantees are: guarantee the good issuance of loans, guarantee the overall planning and use of funds, guarantee the realization of production plans, and guarantee that income reaches the general level of the local area; one through-to-the-end means supporting to the end from beginning to end, until the poor teams catch up with the rich teams. The four mores are: more production avenues, more accumulation and manufacture of fertilizer, more agricultural production, and more sideline income; the six goods are: good political and ideological education, good implementation of the principle of running the communes diligently and thriftily, good reform of tools to improve labor efficiency, good implementation of technical specifications, good breeding and management of pigs, and good development of diversified operations; the two no lacks are: no lack of major production materials, and no basic lack of daily living expenses. After this experience was promoted throughout the county by the Jiangyou County Party Committee, it was immediately warmly supported by all members of the poor teams. The finance department also, based on the principle of "allocating quickly and using well," allocated 326,000 yuan of financial investment to support poor communes and teams, and delivered the production materials needed by the poor teams and communes to their doorsteps in a timely manner. In this way, in a few months, through the efforts of the poor teams themselves, plus the state's assistance, 25 of the county's 102 poor teams basically caught up with the level of the rich teams, 46 teams improved to the level of the average teams, and 44 poor teams were rated as advanced production units in the county. As the production and income of the poor teams increased, the turnover of agricultural loan funds became faster and played a greater role. According to the statistics of 58 poor teams, they received a total of 177,900 yuan in loans from banks and credit cooperatives last year. After repaying 181,500 yuan in the fall (including some old debts from previous years), they still had 290,000 yuan in deposits, an average of 5,000 yuan per team.

The finance and banking departments of Jiangyou County have also done an excellent job in helping industrial and mining enterprises establish and improve financial management systems, promote economic accounting, reduce costs, and carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Last year, the finance and banking departments assisted 90% of the county's enterprises in establishing and improving financial management systems, tapping the potential of funds and materials by 5.1 million yuan, and directly assisted enterprises in solving problems in production, supply, sales, and transportation.

The main reasons why the finance and banking departments of Jiangyou County have been able to achieve the above results are that they closely rely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to the principle of putting politics in command, closely center the finance and banking work around the central work of the Party, and adopt the methods of combining internal and external efforts, cooperating in all aspects, and launching mass movements. The Jiangyou County Party Committee, based on the spirit of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, strengthened its leadership over the work of finance and banking by grasping policies, grasping ideology, and grasping organization. Last year, the county Party Committee organized cadres to launch three debates targeting the main ideological tendencies of finance and banking cadres at various periods, so that they could establish political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints, and maintain vigorous revolutionary spirit. The finance and banking departments also arranged departmental work around the central work of the Party, promptly reflected relevant situations and problems to the county Party Committee, and put forward corresponding suggestions. The finance and banking departments launched mass movements through the central work, combining the mass movements of their own departments with the mass movements of factories and enterprises and people's communes, promoting each other.

    支援公社大发展　扶助穷队赶富队　充当厂矿好参谋
    江油财政金融部门一心为生产
    重要经验：事事从生产出发　紧紧围绕中心工作　内外结合各方协作
    据新华社成都7日电　四川省江油县财政、银行部门全力为生产服务，成为四川省财政、银行工作的一面红旗。他们在1959年坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，事事从生产出发，积极参与、组织生产，出色地支援了工农业的大发展，本部门的各项任务也都超额完成。
    1959年，江油县的工农业生产突飞猛进地发展，对财政、银行工作提出了更高、更多的要求。财政和银行部门针对这一新情况，在全体职工中进行了大力支持工农业生产、为国家积累建设资金的教育，接着开展了一个群众运动，支援公社发展农业生产，扶持穷队赶上富队，为工矿企业当参谋、出主意、四面挂钩、多方帮助。
    去年春耕开始的时候，人民银行江油县支行为了及时支援农业生产，首先克服了干部在发放农贷工作中的“三等待”思想，即一等生产季节，二等公社编好计划，三等供销社开始供应农业生产资料；提出“三主动”，即主动和公社研究，主动帮助公社编制生产财务计划，主动送款上门。他们派出工作组到公社种农贷“试验田”，通过试点，提出一套“一查、二送、三制造”（即查公社和大队的生产资料需要量和需要时间，查商业部门现有生产资料库存，查公社和大队的物资潜力；送生产资料、肥料、贷款；协助公社举办肥料、农具、农药、饲料制造厂）和“农具的制造、修补、爱护相结合”的方法，向党委汇报，由党委组织各有关部门共同实行。采取三主动和这一系列的工作方法以后，就使国家投资、农业贷款和公社生产计划结合起来，使农业贷款和生产资料供应工作结合起来，做到了从实际出发，按需要贷款，贷款使用在最需要的地方。在一切准备工作作好以后，财贸各部门就在党委领导下，密切配合，统一行动，财政部门发放投资，银行和信用社发放贷款，供销社供应物资，使生产队及时得到资金和生产资料。去年的农业贷款在3月底基本发放完毕，走在生产季节前面，做到了不误农时。
    除了贷款以外，银行又根据勤俭办社的方针，协助公社兴建和扩建了三百五十一个农具厂和一千五百多个肥料厂，自制农具和肥料。又从安排群众经济生活入手，积极地吸储分散在群众手里的闲置资金，用于生产。他们在人民公社食堂设立储蓄组，帮助群众安排生活，办理储蓄业务，协助生产队组织社员发展多种经营，协助食堂健全账目，成为组织群众经济生活的一种良好形式。由于普遍建立了储蓄组，去年全县农村储蓄计划提前半年超额24％完成。根据在食堂内建立储蓄组的经验，银行又进一步在厂矿企业内建立了储蓄所四十一个、代办所一百一十个，扩大了储蓄业务。
    去年3月，中共江油县委根据中央和省委的指示，号召财政、银行部门积极扶持穷队，帮助穷队赶上富队。财政、银行部门的职工提出“以穷队为家，定把穷队变富队”的口号。县支行抽调了七十一个银行和信用社干部到穷队参加生产，帮助穷队筹划资金，抓生产关键，发展多种经营。他们通过试点工作和调查研究，根据“自力更生为主，国家援助为辅”的原则，提出“三同、四包、一竿到底”的办法，扶助穷队赶富队，达到“四多、六好、两不缺”。三同是：同吃同住同劳动；四包是：包贷款发放好，包资金统筹安排使用好，包生产计划实现好，包收入赶上当地一般水平；一竿到底即自始至终扶持到底，直到赶上富队。四多是：生产门路多，积肥造肥多，农业增产多，副业收入多；六好是：政治思想教育好，贯彻勤俭办社方针好，改革工具提高劳动效率好，贯彻技术规格好，生猪饲养管理好，多种经营发展好；两不缺是：主要生产资料不缺，日用生活费用基本不缺。这项经验经中共江油县委在全县推广后，立即得到了所有穷队社员的热烈拥护。财政部门也本着“拨快、用好”的原则，拨出三十二万六千元的财政投资，支持穷社、穷队，并及时把穷队、穷社需要的生产资料送上门去。这样，在几个月中，通过穷队自己的努力，再加上国家的扶助，全县一百零二个穷队，就有二十五个队基本上赶上了富队水平，有四十六个队提高到一般队的水平，有四十四个穷队被评为全县先进生产单位。由于穷队生产和收入增加，农贷资金周转更快，更充分发挥了农贷资金的作用。据五十八个穷队统计，去年得到银行和信用社贷款共一十七万七千九百元，秋后归还一十八万一千五百元（包括部分历年旧欠）以后，还留有存款二十九万元，平均每队五千元。
    江油县财政、银行部门在帮助工矿企业建立和健全财务管理制度，推行经济核算，降低成本，开展增产节约等方面，也做得出色。去年，财政、银行部门协助全县90％的企业建立和健全了财务管理制度，挖掘资金和物资潜力五百一十万元，并且直接协助企业解决产、供、销、运等方面存在的问题。
    江油县财政、银行部门能够取得以上成绩，主要原因是紧紧依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，将财政、银行工作紧紧围绕党的中心工作，并且采取了内外结合、各方协作，大搞群众运动的方法。中共江油县委根据统筹兼顾、全面安排的精神，通过抓政策、抓思想、抓组织，加强了对财政、银行工作的领导。去年，县委针对财政、银行干部各个时期的主要思想倾向，组织干部展开了三次辩论，使他们树立起政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，保持旺盛的革命干劲。财政、银行部门并且围绕党的中心工作安排部门工作，及时向县委反映有关的情况和问题，提出相应的建议。财政、银行部门通过中心工作开展了群众运动，将本部门的群众运动与工厂企业、人民公社的群众运动结合起来，互相促进。（附图片）
