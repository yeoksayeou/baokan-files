To the Editor:

I was overjoyed to hear the news that China's national economic plan for 1959 had been overfulfilled. As the saying goes, "Ants can't shake a big tree." I remember last spring, the imperialist elements were constantly shouting about "China's production regression." This time, the released 1959 economic communique gave them a resounding slap in the face.

Take our commune as the most powerful proof: last year, we suffered from frost, drought, and floods. Heavy rain washed away large areas of crops, but the people's commune had a large population and great strength. The commune members dug canals to drain water and rushed to replant in the rain, finally overcoming the natural disasters and achieving an all-round bumper harvest. In 1959, the total vegetable output of the whole commune increased by more than 20% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, pig raising increased by 84% compared with 1958, and the total annual income increased by more than a quarter. Without the people's commune, how could such a miracle have occurred!

Just as the communique was announced, our commune was making many preparations for continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1960. Braving the severe cold, the commune members built five drainage ditches totaling sixty-six li in length, so that they would not be afraid of heavy rain in the future. We are also leveling land, building pens, and cultivating vegetable seedlings. We will produce 200 million catties of vegetables, 15,600 fat pigs, and 700,000 pots of flowers for Beijing this year to further meet the needs of the urban people.

### 为首都生产更多蔬菜和鲜花

    为首都生产更多蔬菜和鲜花编辑同志：
    听到1959年我国国民经济计划已经超额完成的消息，我从心眼里感到高兴。俗话说“蚂蚁晃不倒大树”。我记得去年春天，帝国主义分子不是成天叫喊什么“中国生产跃退了”。这回公布的1959年经济公报，给了他们一个清脆的耳光。
    拿我们公社来说，就是一个最有力的证明：去年我们这里受到了霜冻、旱、涝灾，大雨冲毁了大片庄稼，可是人民公社人多力量大，社员们开渠排水，冒雨抢种，终于战胜了自然灾害，取得了全面丰收。1959年全社蔬菜总产量比大跃进的1958年增长了20％多，养猪比1958年增长了84％，全年总收入增加了四分之一以上。如果没有人民公社，哪能出现这样的奇迹呢！
    就在公报公布的时候，我们公社正在为1960年继续跃进进行着很多准备工作。社员们冒着严寒，修了五条长达六十六里的排水沟，以后再下大雨也不怕了。我们还在整地、建圈、培育菜苗，我们要在今年为北京市生产二亿斤蔬菜、一万五千六百头肥猪和七十万盆鲜花，进一步满足城市人民的需要。
