Make Whatever the Commune Needs
Zhang Zhijun Chen Yuqiong

In Daxin County, Guangxi, all the mountain streams, rivers, and ditches are benefiting the people. Water power drives machines, replacing manual labor for husking rice, grinding flour, threshing... New-style farm tools work in the fields, and various vehicles run on the roads. The phenomenon of "husking rice by hand, pushing the mill with the belly, cutting grain ear by ear, and transporting by shoulder" has become or is becoming a historical relic.

It has been less than a year since Daxin County utilized water power for processing and promoted new-style farm tools and vehicles, and now it has blossomed everywhere. This great leap forward fact eloquently proves the power of carrying out mass movements under the leadership of the Party. In the mass movement of vigorously carrying out agricultural tool innovation, two problems were encountered: Where do some of the more complex machines come from? How can the technology for assembling and using machines be quickly mastered by the masses? The Daxin County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party successfully solved these problems. Under the leadership and support of the County Party Committee, an excellent agricultural machinery factory was established. Like a hen laying eggs and hatching chicks, it armed the people's communes with machines and technology, promoting the great development of industrial and agricultural production throughout the county.

Clear Direction, Facing the Countryside

The "old hen" of Daxin County was formerly a iron and woodworking cooperative. During the Great Leap Forward last year, it relied on its own efforts and gradually developed into a rudimentary agricultural machinery factory. It now has six workshops and one hundred and forty-five employees, capable of manufacturing its own lathes, electric welding machines, etc.

After arming itself and having the ability to produce machines, a prominent question was: What products should be manufactured? Some people advocated concentrating on producing relatively advanced and large-scale machines in batches. Eight lathes were produced, but they could not be sold. Because at this time, the people's communes urgently needed rice milling machines, flour milling machines, and various new-style agricultural tools, but the agricultural machinery factory did not have these. The County Party Committee studied these situations and clearly pointed out that the agricultural machinery factory must face the countryside and serve agricultural production. In coordination with the county's plan to utilize water power, the County Party Committee instructed that the current task of the agricultural machinery factory was to arm the county's water power stations with machines and support agricultural production with new-style farm tools. And it put forward specific indicators, among which an important item was to produce one hundred rice milling machines in 1959.

"Fighting for a Hundred Machines" became the battle cry of all factory employees after the summer of 1959. In the process of manufacturing rice milling machines and various new-style agricultural tools, there was a lack of experience and technical knowledge, especially a shortage of gray cast iron raw materials. However, the difficulties did not frighten the heroic people. All factory employees were determined to smelt gray cast iron from the white cast iron produced during the Great Steel Campaign of the previous year in their own indigenous blast furnace. Therefore, the furnace design was modified five times, and after many failures, gray cast iron was finally smelted. Then, the "sand casting gate" was conquered. The first rice milling machine, cast with "Daxin Made," was officially produced on July 29 last year.

When the communes heard that the agricultural machinery factory was manufacturing rice milling machines to arm the power stations, they rushed to repair the water turbine and looked forward to the factory's machines being produced. When the Songdong Commune heard that the agricultural machinery factory needed charcoal, they immediately sent people to the mountains to burn charcoal and deliver it. When the agricultural machinery factory lacked bricks, the nearby Taocheng Commune immediately sent 15,000 bricks. These scenes further educated all factory employees, and everyone realized that their work was closely related to the broad masses of farmers. Therefore, the factory doors were opened wide, and close ties were established with various communes, assisting the people's communes in carrying out the tool reform movement among the masses.

Investigation and Research to Meet Needs

In order to better serve agriculture and promote the county's tool reform movement, the leading comrades of the county industrial department and the agricultural machinery factory went deep into the countryside to investigate and study what kind of machinery the communes urgently needed. Li Futian, director of the County Industrial Bureau, took a survey team to investigate a production team in Taiping Commune and personally saw that a bumper harvest was in sight, but there was a shortage of labor. Old farmer Liang Huasheng said: "The harvest season is coming, how can dozens of people harvest so much grain this year?" Comrade Li Futian made a detailed calculation with them. If enough sickles could be equipped, and threshing machines and ox carts could be used, the problem could be solved.

The survey team returned to the factory, comprehensively studied the needs of the countryside for various machines, and revised their original production plan. While continuing to manufacture rice milling machines, they also manufactured two flour milling machines, twenty corn threshing machines, twenty paper pulping machines, ten sugarcane leaf stripping machines, fifty disc power saws, one slicing machine, one hundred and eight fixed-type carts, more than seven hundred sets of vehicle iron parts, more than one thousand one hundred sets of ball bearings, nineteen rice transplanters, more than seven thousand eight hundred plowshares, and tens of thousands of various small farm tools, with a total output value of more than 200,000 yuan, and on November 27, 1959, they stepped into 1960 ahead of schedule.

Rely on the Masses to Spread Technology

Not only make whatever the commune needs, but also ensure that the maximum effectiveness of the product is brought into play. That is to say, not only "lay eggs," but also "hatch every egg into a chick." The agricultural machinery factory's spirit of being responsible to the end is manifested in the following two aspects:

The factory selected sixteen skilled technicians to form a "mobile team." Whenever the communes encountered any difficulties in the process of assembling and using the machines, they would go to solve them at any time. Not long ago, a rice milling machine in a hydropower station broke down. At two o'clock in the morning, a phone call was made to the agricultural machinery factory, and the mobile team rushed there. Before dawn, the machine was repaired. The work style of the mobile team workers deeply moved the farmers.

The leaders of the agricultural machinery factory considered that the number of places using power and machines was increasing day by day, and it was not enough to rely on a few mobile teams "flying all over the sky." It was necessary to pass on the technology to the masses to help the process of water power and agricultural mechanization. Therefore, the method of short-term training courses was adopted. Whenever a new machine that needed to be vigorously promoted was manufactured, the County Party Committee was consulted, and ironworkers, carpenters, and new agricultural tool hands from various communes were called to try to make them according to the model. After the machines were made, they could only leave the factory after they passed the inspection and reached the "three skills" (knowing how to manufacture, use, and repair). Some machines, such as rice milling machines, which the communes are currently unable to manufacture themselves, also require people to come to the factory to learn how to assemble, use, and maintain them. From August to December 1959, a total of five training courses were held, training more than 350 people. Relying on them, the flower of technology bloomed throughout the county.

    公社要什么就造什么
    张智钧  陈裕琼
    在广西大新县，所有的山溪、河流、沟渠，都在为人们造福。水力推动机器，代替了人工舂米、磨粉、脱粒……新式农具在田地里工作，各种车辆在大路上奔跑，“稻谷用手舂，推磨使肚顶，收谷逐穗剪，运输靠肩挑”的现象，已经变成或正在变成历史的陈迹了。
    大新县利用水力加工和推广新式农具、车辆，还不到一年时间，而现在已经遍地开花。这个大跃进的事实，雄辩地证明了在党的领导下大搞群众运动的威力。在大搞农具革新的群众运动中，曾遇到这样两个问题：一些比较复杂的机器从何得来？装配和使用机器的技术，怎样才能迅速为广大群众所掌握？中共大新县委圆满地解决了这些问题。在县委领导和支持下，办起了一个出色的农械厂，它像母鸡下蛋孵雏一样，把机器和技术武装了人民公社，促进了全县工农业生产的大发展。
    明确方向　面向农村
    大新县的这只“老母鸡”，前身是铁木工合作社，在去年的大跃进中，自力更生，自己武装自己，逐步发展成为初具规模的农械厂。现在有六个车间，一百四十五名职工，能够自己制造车床、电焊机等。
    在自己武装了自己，有能力生产机器以后，一个突出的问题是：究竟制造什么产品？有人主张集中精力成批生产比较高级的、大型的机器。车床生产了八台，可是却卖不出去。因为，这时各个人民公社迫切需要的是碾米机、磨粉机，以及各式各样的新式农具，偏偏农械厂没有这些东西。县委研究了这些情况，明确指出农械厂必须面向农村，为农业生产服务。配合全县开展利用水力动力的计划，县委指示农械厂当前的任务是：以机器武装全县的水利动力站，以新式农具支援农业生产。并且提出了具体指标，其中重要的一项是在1959年内，生产出一百台碾米机。
    “为百台而战”，成为1959年入夏以后全厂职工的战斗口号。制造碾米机和各种新式农具的过程中，因为没有经验，不懂技术，特别是缺乏灰口铁铸件原料。但是，困难并没有吓住英雄的人们。全厂职工决心一定要在自己的土高炉内，用前年大办钢铁的白口铁，炼出灰口铁。于是，五次修改炉型，经历了多次的失败，终于炼出了灰口铁。接着又攻克了“沙型关”。第一台铸着“大新造”的碾米机，去年7月29日正式制成。
    各公社听说农械厂制造碾米机，武装动力站，纷纷把水道涡轮赶修好，盼望农械厂的机器出厂。松洞公社听说农械厂需要炭，马上抽出人上山烧炭送上门。农械厂缺砖，附近的桃城公社立即送来一万五千块。这些情景，进一步教育了全厂职工，大家体会到自己的工作与广大农民息息相关。于是大开厂门，和各个公社密切挂起钩来，协助人民公社在群众中开展了工具改革运动。
    调查研究适应需要
    为了更好地为农业服务，推动全县工具改革运动，县工业部门和农械厂的领导同志深入农村，进行调查，研究各公社究竟迫切需要什么机械。县工业局长黎福田，带着调查组在太平公社调查了一个生产队，亲眼看到丰收在望，而劳动力不足。老农梁华生说：“收割季节到了，今年这样多的谷，几十个人怎么收得完？”黎福田同志跟他们具体算了一笔账，如果能配足镰刀，使用打谷机和牛车，就可以解决问题了。
    调查组回到厂里，综合研究了农村中对各种器械的需要，修订了自己原来的生产计划。在继续制造碾米机的同时，还制造出磨粉机二台、玉米脱粒机二十台、造纸打浆机二十台、甘蔗剥叶机十台、圆盘动力锯五十部、切片机一部、定型车子一百零八辆、车辆铁件七百多套、滚珠轴承一千一百多套、插秧机十九部、犁头七千八百多个、各种小农具上万件，总产值达到二十多万元，在1959年11月27日提前跨进了1960年。
    依靠群众传播技术
    不仅是公社要什么就造什么，而且造出来就一定要发挥这种产品的最大效用。也就是说，不仅“下蛋”，而且要把每一个蛋“孵成小鸡”。农械厂这种负责到底的精神，表现在下面两个方面：
    厂里抽出了十六名熟练技术工人，组成了“流动组”，各公社在装配使用机器的过程中，碰到什么困难，他们就随时前去解决。前不久，有个水力动力站的一台碾米机出了故障，半夜两点钟打电话到农械厂，流动组赶去，东方还没发白，机器就修好了。流动组工人的这种作风，深深感动了农民。
    农械厂的领导人考虑到，使用动力和机器的地方日益增多，光靠几个流动组“满天飞”还不行，必须把技术传授给群众，才有助于水力动力化和农业机械化的进程。因此，采用了短期训练班的方式，每逢制成一种需要大力推广的新机械，就请示县委，召集各公社的铁工木工和新农具手前来依样试制，制成后，经过检查合格，而且达到“三会”（会制造、会使用、会修理），才能带机械出厂。有些机械，目前公社还不可能自己制造的，如碾米机，也要来人在厂里学会装配、使用、维修。从1959年8月至12月，共开办训练班五次，训练出三百五十多人；依靠他们，使技术之花开遍了全县。
