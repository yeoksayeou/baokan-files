Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, January 1st: The "Voice of Free Men" newspaper in Iraq published a commentary today regarding U.S. President Eisenhower's announcement that the United States has the "freedom to resume nuclear testing." The commentary stated that the United States is still desperately intensifying international tensions, exacerbating the Cold War, and creating various obstacles on the path to understanding between East and West. Just as negotiations on the issue of convening a summit meeting are underway, and just as the whole world welcomes the New Year with the greatest hope, the U.S. President, citing the expiration of the original one-year deadline, announced that the United States has the "freedom to resume nuclear testing."

The newspaper pointed out that this excuse cannot stand up to the facts, because the U.S. delegation in Geneva should be held responsible for failing to reach a resolution on the non-continuation of nuclear testing.

    伊拉克“自由人之声报”指责美国千方百计加剧国际紧张局势
    新华社巴格达1日电　“自由人之声报”今天就美国总统艾森豪威尔宣布美国有“恢复核试验的自由”一事发表评论说，美国还在千方百计加剧国际紧张局势、加剧冷战，在东西方谅解的道路上制造各种障碍。正当关于召开最高级会议问题的谈判在进行之中、正当全世界迎接新年而寄以最大的希望的时候，美国总统竟借口原定一年的期限已经届满而宣布美国有“恢复核试验的自由”。
    报纸指出，这种借口在事实面前是站不住脚的，因为在日内瓦的美国代表团应对未能就不继续核试验取得解决负责。
