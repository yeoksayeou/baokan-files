Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, January 26th: The Second Pan-African People's Conference, which opened here yesterday, held a plenary session this morning.

    The meeting was presided over by Ahmed Trilili, head of the Tunisian delegation elected as chairman of the conference. The meeting elected a six-member committee, including the heads of the Algerian, Guinean, UAR, and Nigerian delegations, and Secretary-General Diallo, to assist the chairman in his work.

    In his speech, Trilili expressed his deep conviction that this conference would contribute to the cause of African independence. At the chairman's suggestion, the delegates stood in silence for one minute for those who sacrificed for the cause of African independence. Trilili, on behalf of the conference, paid tribute to Kenyan leader Kenyatta, Nyasaland leader Dr. Banda, Algerian leader Ben Bella, and those African leaders who are still in prison.

    Trilili expressed support for the Kenyan, Congolese, and Malian delegations, which are negotiating with the British, Belgian, and French authorities in London, Brussels, and Paris, respectively, on the issue of their own countries' independence.
