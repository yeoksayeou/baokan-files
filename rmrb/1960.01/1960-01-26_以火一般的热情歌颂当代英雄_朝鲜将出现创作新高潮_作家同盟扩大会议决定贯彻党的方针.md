    The Central Committee of the Korean Writers' Union held an enlarged meeting on the 20th and 21st to discuss the issue of launching a new upsurge in literary creation in Korea. The meeting decided to adhere to and thoroughly implement the basic policy of the Korean Workers' Party regarding strengthening the connection between literature and the people's lives.
    Han Sorya, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Writers' Union, delivered a report at the meeting, and many writers spoke. The meeting held that the actual lives of writers who went to the countryside and factories to live and learn with the masses for a period of time clearly demonstrated the correctness of the Party's basic policy. Through labor, life and research into reality, the writers who went to the countryside and factories tempered their thinking, gained rich life experience, and laid the foundation for creation. These writers are creating excellent works with fiery enthusiasm that can vividly reflect current life and express the image of today's protagonists.
    The meeting also discussed issues such as guaranteeing writers sufficient time and conditions for creation, and giving writers working in Writers' Union organs the opportunity to have contact with reality, and adopted countermeasures.
    The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to improve the ideological and artistic quality of literary works, and boldly use artistic images to express the wisdom and talent, and optimistic revolutionary style of today's new people, the working class and peasants.
    Kim Chang-man, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, attended the meeting and spoke at the meeting.
