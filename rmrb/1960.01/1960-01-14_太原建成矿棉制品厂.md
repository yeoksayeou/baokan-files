    Taiyuan Built Mineral Wool Products Factory
    (From our newspaper) Taiyuan recently built a mineral wool products factory, and the first set of equipment was officially put into production recently. The production process of this mineral wool factory is mechanized, using waste slag and bricks from Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company as raw materials, and can produce 20,000 tons of slag wool annually.
    The performance of slag wool is similar to that of asbestos, and it can insulate, soundproof, insulate against heat, and insulate against moisture. It is an important material for industrial construction.

    太原建成矿棉制品厂
    本报讯　太原最近建成矿棉制品厂，第一套设备在最近正式投入生产。这座矿棉厂生产工序都是机械化，利用太钢的废炉碴和砖块作原料，每年可以生产两万吨矿碴棉。
    矿碴棉的性能同石棉类似，可以保温、隔音、隔热、隔潮，是工业建筑的重要材料。
