Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: In 1959, universities and colleges across the country vigorously promoted the communist spirit of collaboration in scientific research, successfully completed national scientific research tasks, and improved the level of scientific research and teaching quality.

Universities and colleges further implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor, insisted that scientific research serve production and construction, and in 1959 vigorously strengthened inter-school cooperation, cooperation between schools and scientific research institutions, and cooperation between schools and industrial and mining enterprises, people's communes, and medical units. They widely supported each other, shared resources, and exchanged information in the fields of science and technology, equipment, technical intelligence, and books and materials. Harbin Institute of Technology has so far cooperated with 547 factories and enterprises, conducting research on 728 scientific topics. Almost all majors in the university have signed scientific research cooperation contracts with factories, and the footprints of teachers and students have spread across fifteen provinces and more than one hundred cities and counties in the north and south. Tongji University has established cooperative relationships with more than 300 business units across the country. The Department of Mechanical Engineering of Chongqing University has established cooperative relationships or contacts with almost all large and small machinery factories in the local area. In addition to carrying out large-scale collective collaboration with 26 scientific research institutions or universities and colleges, Henan Agricultural College has also established teaching bases in 19 advanced agricultural production areas in the province, and has closely cooperated with people's communes. Harbin Medical University has closely cooperated with vast urban and rural medical units and medical and health workers to carry out scientific research in medical prevention and treatment, with great results.

Practice has proven that this kind of communist collaboration is a very important guideline and measure for universities and colleges to successfully complete national scientific research tasks. The Thermal Engineering Teaching and Research Group of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Zhejiang University has successively cooperated with 12 units including the Turbine and Boiler Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the Shanghai Boiler Factory to conduct experimental research on "liquid slag cyclone furnace." This is a major task to solve the technical problems of steam boilers, the main equipment in thermal power plants. The cooperating units invested in establishing an experimental platform equivalent in scale to half a small thermal power plant at Zhejiang University as an experimental research base. Thanks to the joint efforts of the cooperating units, this research experiment has achieved preliminary results. The single-phase commutator traction motor successfully trial-produced by Tangshan Railway College is also the result of vigorous collaboration with more than 400 factories and mining enterprises across the country, jointly solving the problems of components and materials required in the trial production, and jointly laboring. In order to complete the task of "research on the scope of the hinterland of Dalian and Yingkou ports in the early stage of navigation of the Songliao Canal," Dalian Maritime College, through extensive cooperative relationships, conducted a comprehensive economic survey of the main materials in the three northeastern provinces, and understood and analyzed the current situation and long-term plans of Dalian and Yingkou ports, and made a boundary between the two ports' hinterland, providing a more solid reference for the future planning work of the two ports.

Through such large-scale cooperation, universities and colleges have not only solved many problems in the production of relevant units, promoted production, but also improved the level of scientific research and teaching quality of the schools. Many scientific research works of Tsinghua University in the past year or so, especially the scientific research works of some major projects, have been developed and driven by close cooperation and mutual support with enterprises. For example, the research and trial production of program-controlled machine tools carried out by the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing in cooperation with the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory has driven the development of scientific research in several majors such as automatic control and electrical engineering towards precision and cutting-edge technology; with the strong support of relevant industrial departments, the Department of Engineering Physics has carried out research, design and manufacturing in the peaceful use of atomic energy. The development of this work has also driven the development of scientific research in several majors such as machinery, civil engineering, electrical engineering, and automatic control in seven or eight departments towards new technologies. These many research results are reflected in the teaching materials at any time, promoting the continuous enrichment of the teaching materials, and the continuous innovation and enrichment of the content. The welding major of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Harbin Institute of Technology cooperated with many factories and mines to conduct comprehensive research on electroslag welding, and wrote a more systematic and complete "Electroslag Welding Technology," which enriched the teaching content of the welding major, and further developed the science and technology of electroslag welding.

Establishing cooperative relationships between universities and colleges and production units has also opened up a base for the three-way combination of teaching, scientific research and productive labor, and found an effective way to implement the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor and improving teaching quality. For example, Shenyang Agricultural College has established a long-term cooperative relationship with the Gaokan People's Commune in the suburbs of Shenyang. Each major in the school has taken over the technical problems of the commune and studied and solved them together with the commune members in productive labor. In the past year, while working, they have assisted the commune in preventing and controlling more than 20 kinds of diseases and insect pests, such as potato late blight and cucumber powdery mildew, which are the most harmful, playing a certain role in ensuring a bumper harvest in agriculture. At the same time, it has also enriched the practical experience of teachers and improved their professional level. Teachers conduct on-site teaching based on various situations of disease and pest control, so that students can consolidate the theories learned in the classroom, and learn living knowledge and master technology.

In the past year, in the cooperation with relevant units, universities and colleges in various places have generally adhered to the spirit of consistent goals, mutual benefit, mutual support, self-restraint and helping others, learning from each other's strengths, and jointly advancing; especially under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, they have resolutely struggled against bourgeois ideas such as personal fame and gain and departmentalism in scientific research work, so the cooperative relationship has been continuously improved and the work has progressed rapidly. For example, the Shanghai First Medical College cooperated with medical units such as Zhongshan and Guangci in Shanghai, and was able to research and manufacture a well-performing artificial heart-lung machine in a short period of one year and successfully apply it in clinical practice. One of the important reasons is that under the unified planning and unified leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China on the city's scientific research work, the communist spirit of cooperation has overcome the past decentralized and monopolistic bourgeois work styles of these units. In summarizing the achievements and experiences of vigorously promoting the spirit of cooperation in scientific research work in the past year, universities and colleges unanimously believe that this is a great victory of the Party's general line and the Party's education policy, and a great victory of adhering to political command and adhering to the mass line in scientific research work.

    校内校外互相支援互通有无大兴协作之风
    高等学校科学研究硕果满枝
    出色地完成国家任务，提高了学校科学研究水平和教学质量
    新华社31日讯　全国高等学校1959年在科学研究工作方面大兴共产主义协作之风，出色地完成了国家科学研究任务，提高了学校的科学研究水平和教学质量。
    各高等学校进一步贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，坚持科学研究为生产建设服务，在1959年大力加强了校际合作，学校与科学研究机关合作，学校与工矿企业、人民公社、医疗单位合作，广泛地在科学技术、设备器材、技术情报、图书资料等方面互相支援、互通有无。哈尔滨工业大学到目前止先后与五百四十七个工厂企业单位合作，对七百二十八个科学专题进行了研究。全校所有的专业几乎都与工厂订立科学研究合作合同，师生们的足迹遍及南北十五个省和一百多个市、县。同济大学同全国各地三百多个业务单位建立协作关系。重庆大学机械系同当地所有大小机械厂几乎都建立协作关系或联系。河南农学院除了同二十六个科学研究机关或高等学校进行集体大协作以外，还在本省十九个农业生产先进地区建立教学基点，同人民公社进行了密切合作。哈尔滨医科大学同广大城乡医疗单位和医药卫生工作者密切合作，开展医疗防治方面的科学研究工作，收获很大。
    实践证明，这种共产主义大协作，是当前高等学校顺利完成国家科学研究任务的十分重要的方针和措施。浙江大学机械系热工教研组先后同第一机械工业部汽轮机锅炉研究所、上海锅炉厂等十二个单位分工协作，进行“液态排渣旋风炉”的试验研究。这是为解决火力发电厂中主要设备蒸汽锅炉技术问题的一项重大任务。协作单位投资在浙江大学建立了一个规模相当于半个小型火力发电厂的试验台，作为试验研究基地。由于协作单位的共同努力，目前这一研究试验已获初步成果。唐山铁道学院试制成功的单相整流子牵引电动机，也是同全国各地四百多个厂矿企业大力协作，共同解决试制中所需原件和材料问题，共同劳动的结晶。大连海运学院为完成“松辽运河通航初期，大连、营口两港腹地范围的研究”这一任务，曾经通过广泛的协作关系，对东北三省主要的物资作了全面经济调查，对大连、营口两港当前情况和远景规划进行了解和分析，作出两港腹地分界，为两港今后规划工作提供了较有根据的参考资料。
    高等学校通过这样的大协作，不仅解决了有关单位生产中的许多问题，促进了生产，而且提高了学校的科学研究水平和教学质量。清华大学这一年多来的很多科学研究工作，特别是一些重大项目的科学研究工作，都是同企业单位密切协作、相互支援下发展、带动起来的。如机械制造系同北京市第一机床厂协作进行的程序控制机床的研究和试制工作，就带动了自动控制、电机等若干个专业的科学研究向精密、尖端技术发展；工程物理系在有关工业部门的大力支持下，开展了和平利用原子能方面的研究、设计和制造工作，这一工作的开展也带动了机械、土木、电机、自动控制等七八个系若干专业的科学研究向着新技术方面发展。这许多研究成果，随时反映到教材中，促进教材不断丰富，内容不断革新和充实。哈尔滨工业大学机械系焊接专业同许多厂矿协作，进行电渣焊的综合研究，写出了一本较系统、较完整的“电渣焊工艺学”，充实了焊接专业的教学内容，并且使电渣焊的科学技术有了进一步的发展。
    高等学校与生产单位建立协作关系，还开辟了教学、科学研究和生产劳动三结合的基地，为贯彻党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针和提高教学质量找到了一条有效的途径。如沈阳农学院同沈阳郊区高坎人民公社建立长远协作关系，学校各个专业分别把公社的技术问题包下来，在生产劳动中，同社员们一起研究解决。一年来，他们一面劳动，一面协助公社防治为害最大的马铃薯晚疫病、黄瓜白粉病等二十多种病虫害，对保证农业大丰收起了一定作用，同时也丰富了教师们的实际经验，提高了业务水平。教师们根据防治病虫害的各种情况进行现场教学，使学生在课堂上所学到的理论巩固下来，并学到了活知识，掌握了技术。
    一年来，各地高等学校在同有关单位的协作中，一般都能本着双方目标一致、互相有利、互相支持、克己助人、取长补短、共同跃进的精神；特别是在各级党委的统一领导下，对科学研究工作中的个人名利、本位主义等资产阶级思想进行了坚决的斗争，因而协作关系不断改善，工作进展迅速。如上海第一医学院同上海市中山、广慈等医疗单位协作，能够在短短一年时间内研究制造出性能良好的人工心肺机，并在临床应用成功，其重要原因之一，就是由于在中共上海市委对全市科学研究工作的统一规划、统一领导下，共产主义协作精神战胜了这些单位过去各自为政、互相垄断等资产阶级思想作风的缘故。各高等学校在总结这一年来科学研究工作大兴协作之风所取得的成绩和经验时，一致认为这是党的总路线和党的教育方针的伟大胜利，是科学研究工作坚持政治挂帅、坚持群众路线的伟大胜利。（附图片）
