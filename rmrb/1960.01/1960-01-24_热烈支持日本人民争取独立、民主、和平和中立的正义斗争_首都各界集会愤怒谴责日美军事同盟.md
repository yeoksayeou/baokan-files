Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: The U.S. imperialists' collusion with Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi to sign the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, openly reviving the heinous activities of Japanese militarism, has aroused the boundless anger of the Chinese people who once suffered from the scourge of Japanese militarism. People from all walks of life in the capital solemnly gathered at the CPPCC Auditorium on the afternoon of the 23rd to severely condemn and resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and to warmly support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

The resolution passed by the conference stated: "The Chinese people have always warmly supported the Japanese people's struggle against the revision and for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' and will continue to firmly support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality."

Today's conference was jointly held by six organizations, namely, the China Peace Committee, the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, the All-China Youth Federation, and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. In the past few days, mass rallies will also be held in cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Shenyang to express the firm opposition of the entire Chinese people to the U.S.-Japan military alliance and full support for the just struggle of the Japanese people.

The conference began at 2:00 p.m. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, delivered an important speech at the meeting. (Full text on page 4) He said that the so-called U.S.-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" is a thoroughly aggressive military alliance treaty. The signing of this treaty marks the revival of Japanese militarism under the support of U.S. imperialism and openly participates in the aggressive military bloc led by the United States. The purpose of this treaty is to prepare for new aggression and war, which is a serious provocation to the people of China, the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the people of Asian countries, and seriously threatens peace in the Far East and in the world. The military collusion between the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries is bringing endless disasters upon the Japanese people. This treaty completely violates the will of the Japanese people.

Guo Moruo said that the Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and firmly supported the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and will continue to firmly support them in the future. U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people, the people of Asian countries, and the people of the world. To smash the conspiracy of Nobusuke Kishi and U.S. imperialism to plan new aggression and war in the Far East is not only the task of the Japanese people, but also the common task of the people of all Asian countries and the world. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the Japanese people, the people of Asian countries, and the people of all countries in the world to completely smash the new aggression and war conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and ensure peace in Asia and the world.

During Guo Moruo's speech, warm applause echoed continuously throughout the venue.

Liao Chengzhi pointed out: The new war and aggression intentions of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are unacceptable to the Chinese and Asian people, and are resolutely opposed by the Japanese people.

Today's conference was presided over by Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity. In his speech, he said that everyone still clearly remembers that in the 1930s and 1940s, Japanese militarism committed heinous crimes in China and other Asian countries, causing heavy disasters and losses to the people of China, Korea, Vietnam, Burma, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaya, and Singapore, and also brought extremely serious harm to the Japanese people.

He said that U.S. imperialism, which inherited the mantle of Japanese imperialism's aggression in Asia after World War II, is now colluding with the Japanese militarist forces represented by Nobusuke Kishi to conclude a U.S.-Japan military alliance. The U.S.-Japan military alliance is to prepare for new aggression and war, revive Japanese militarism, make it a real threat to Asia again, and drag the Japanese people into the disaster of war once again. U.S. imperialism wants to incorporate Japan into the U.S. atomic strategy system, attempting to form a network of nuclear war bases that is hostile to the people of China, the Soviet Union, and all of Asia, and make Japan the general arsenal and supply base for the U.S. and Japan to launch aggressive local wars in Asia. These sinister intentions of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are unacceptable to the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries, and are resolutely opposed by the Japanese people. The solemn statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 14, opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance, fully expresses the attitude and will of the Chinese people, and we resolutely support this statement of our government.

Liao Chengzhi said that the Japanese people's struggle is not isolated, it is an important part of the Asian and world people's cause against aggression and in defense of peace, and they have received widespread support from the Chinese people, the people of Asian countries, and all peace-loving people in the world. Nobusuke Kishi and other Japanese militarists will certainly not end well. U.S. imperialism will one day be driven out by the Japanese people. The Japanese people's desire for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will certainly be realized.

Japanese peace activist, Mr. Kinkazu Saionji, said: The Japanese people are determined to fight to the end to liberate themselves from the war and aggression system of U.S. imperialism.

Japanese peace activist Mr. Kinkazu Saionji attended today's conference. When he spoke at the conference, the audience applauded thunderously. On behalf of the Japanese people who are doing their utmost to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and the realization of the U.S.-Japan military alliance, he expressed his deep gratitude to the Chinese people for their consistent and strong support for their struggle. He said that the Japanese people are burning with the fire of anger, firmly believing that the struggle we are waging against the revision of the "Security Treaty" is a just struggle, and in order to further strengthen unity, we are determined to wage a resolute struggle to prevent the ratification of this military alliance treaty.

Mr. Saionji Kinkazu said that in order to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," workers, farmers, women, youth, students, cultural figures, and other peace-loving people from all walks of life in Japan are strengthening and expanding the system of unified action with more angry feelings, determined to fight to the end to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance system, to liberate Japan from the war and aggression system of U.S. imperialism, and to move towards true independence. Moreover, they are determined to fight to the end to restore normal diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and to make Japan a good member of Asian peace construction and move towards a new path. He pointed out: The more Nobusuke Kishi abuses his power and takes high-handed measures, the higher the people's momentum will rise.

Mr. Saionji Kinkazu said that the Nobusuke Kishi group will surely be unpopular and even more isolated. The Japanese people's struggle is by no means isolated and helpless, and there is a strong force supporting us. We Japanese people understand that it is precisely because the U.S.-Japan military alliance is hostile to China and the Soviet Union and regards Asian nations as its targets of aggression that the Japanese people's struggle has received the support of the people of China and the Soviet Union and the Asian nations. It has increased the courage of our Japanese people to fight.

Mr. Saionji Kinkazu's speech was interrupted from time to time by thunderous applause from the audience.

Heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations expressed their warm support for the Chinese government's January 14 statement and their full support for the Japanese people's just struggle.

Heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations spoke at the meeting one after another. They firmly opposed the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, warmly supported the solemn statement issued by our government on January 14 against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, and expressed their full support for the Japanese people's just struggle.

Zhang Zhizhong, vice chairman of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, said, we firmly oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. This treaty is a pair of war shackles imposed on the Japanese people by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, and it is also a heinous tool for them to further enslave the Japanese people. This treaty is an extremely serious step taken by the Japanese reactionaries and U.S. imperialism to prepare for new aggression and war. It is a provocation to the people of Asian countries and also to world peace. We Chinese people firmly stand with the Japanese people and fully support the Japanese people's just struggle for independence, democracy, peace and neutrality, and express our warm respect to the heroic and unyielding Japanese people. We also believe that stopping the revival of Japanese militarism and preventing the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries from carrying out new aggression and war in the Far East is a common and sacred responsibility of all peace-loving people in the world, especially the people of Asian countries.

Yang Mingxuan, vice chairman of the China Democratic League, said that the Chinese people resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance and will never allow Japanese militarism to undermine peace in Asia. We are determined to fight together with the Japanese people and the people of Asian countries to the end against the U.S.-Japan military alliance and to defend peace in Asia and the world. We firmly believe that as long as the Japanese people and the Asian people unite as one and fight resolutely to the end, any form of war aggression policy of U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi reactionary group will be completely defeated, and the peace-loving people of the world will surely be victorious.

Huang Yanpei, chairman of the China National Democratic Construction Association, said that we have suffered greatly from the aggression of Japanese militarism. Therefore, we fully understand the serious significance of the revival of Japanese militarism. The militarist forces in Japan are the enemy of the Chinese people, the enemy of the people of Asian countries, and the enemy of the Japanese people. Now the U.S. imperialists are openly supporting this criminal force, which makes it impossible for us Chinese people, Asian people, and Japanese people not to rise up and more resolutely fight to the end against the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. The only result of what the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have done is to speed up the digging of their own graves.

Liu Changsheng, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said that the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is a blatant aggressive military alliance that is hostile to the people of China, the Soviet Union, and all of Asia. It is the most blatant manifestation of a small group of Japanese monopoly capitalists, represented by Nobusuke Kishi, attempting to restore the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" aggression plan with the help of the United States, and it is a new and important step taken by the United States to accelerate tensions in Asia under the guise of "false peace and true war preparedness." It seriously endangers peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, the Chinese workers and people, who have suffered greatly from the aggression of Japanese militarism, cannot but be seriously vigilant about this. He also said that although the Japanese people's struggle will be long, tortuous, and arduous, the Japanese people are by no means isolated. The Chinese workers and people will always support the Japanese people's just struggle, and all peace-loving people in Asia and the world stand on the side of the Japanese people. We firmly believe that the Japanese workers and people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality must achieve final victory.

Li Dequan, vice chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, said that the U.S. and Japanese ruling groups, ignoring the opposition of the Japanese people and the opposition of the peace-loving people of all countries in the world, signed the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Chinese women express great indignation at this matter, and at the same time, express their high respect to the Japanese people and women for their continued efforts to fight against this treaty. She said that the signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty marks the revival of Japanese militarism, and the Japanese monopoly group represented by Nobusuke Kishi is once again trying to relive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The people of China and Asian countries will not forget the disasters caused by the aggressive wars waged by Japanese militarists in the past. The Chinese people and Chinese women will never allow the revival of Japanese militarism, nor will they allow Japanese militarists to undermine peace in Asia.

Zhang Chao, vice chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, said that the signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance is a move by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to create tension in Asia and seriously threaten the security of Asian countries. This completely exposes the true face of peace recently flaunted by U.S. imperialism. The serious fact at present is that the Japanese militarist forces represented by Nobusuke Kishi have been revived, and Japan is being dragged by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries onto the road of aggression and war. This is resolutely opposed by the Japanese people, resolutely opposed by the Chinese people, and resolutely opposed by the people of Asia and the world who love peace. He said: As long as the Japanese youth and the Japanese people are together and persevere in their struggle, they will surely achieve final victory. Times have changed, and no matter how rampant and arrogant the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are, they cannot save their doomed fate of death. U.S. imperialism will inevitably be driven out by the Japanese people.

Mao Dun, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, said that now, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have colluded, Japanese militarism has been resurrected, U.S. imperialism has tied Japan to its war chariot, a shadow of destruction hangs over Japan, and the spearhead of aggression is directed at China and the Soviet Union, and peace in Asia and the world has been seriously threatened. We must repel this countercurrent. He said: The Japanese people who have suffered greatly from the disaster of war have raised the iron fist of justice, and the waves of protest are like flames. They have carried out unremitting struggles to win independence and defend peace. In the ranks of this great struggle, there are also our colleagues in the literary and art circles - the advanced people in the Japanese literary and art circles, who use literature and art as weapons and are carrying out tenacious struggles for the noble cause. We, the Chinese people, firmly support their struggle and pay tribute to them.

All these speeches aroused waves of applause.

The conference finally unanimously passed a resolution amid thunderous applause, expressing the Chinese people's firm opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance and full support for the Japanese people's just struggle.

Also attending the conference were responsible persons of various democratic parties and people's organizations and well-known figures in the capital, including Chen Shutong, Bao Erhan, Wang Shao'ao, Chen Qiyou, Mao Yisheng, Yan Xinmin, Tian Fuda, Qu Tangliang, and Zheng Senyu. People from Japan, Sudan, New Zealand, and other countries in Beijing were also invited to attend the conference. (Attached picture)

    热烈支持日本人民争取独立、民主、和平和中立的正义斗争
    首都各界集会愤怒谴责日美军事同盟
    郭沫若指出：中国人民愿同日本人民以及亚洲和世界各国人民一起，为彻底粉碎美日反动派新的侵略和战争阴谋，确保亚洲和世界和平而共同奋斗
    据新华社23日讯　美帝国主义勾结日本首相岸信介签订日美军事同盟条约、公然复活日本军国主义的罪恶活动，激起了曾经蒙受过日本军国主义灾祸的中国人民的无比愤怒。首都各界人民23日下午在政协礼堂庄严集会，严厉谴责和坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，热烈支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约和争取独立、民主、和平、中立的正义斗争。
    大会在通过的决议中说：“中国人民一向热烈支持日本人民反对修改和争取废除日美‘安全条约’的斗争，今后将继续坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约，争取独立、民主、和平和中立的正义斗争。”
    今天的大会是由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中华全国总工会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华全国青年联合会和中国文学艺术界联合会等六个团体联合举行的。最近几天，上海、广州、武汉和沈阳等城市，也将分别举行群众大会，以表示全中国人民坚决反对日美军事同盟和完全支持日本人民的正义斗争。
    大会在下午二时开始。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在会上作了重要讲话。（全文见第四版）他说，所谓日美“共同合作和安全条约”，是一个彻头彻尾的侵略性的军事同盟条约。这个条约的签订，标志着日本军国主义在美帝国主义的扶持下的复活，并且公然参加了美国所主持的侵略性的军事集团。这个条约的目的是准备新的侵略和战争，是向中国、苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和亚洲各国人民的严重挑衅，严重地威胁着远东和世界的和平。美日反动派的军事勾结，正给日本人民带来无穷无尽的灾害。这个条约完全违反日本人民的意志。
    郭沫若说，中国人民一向深切同情和坚决支持日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争，今后也仍将继续坚决支持。美帝国主义是中日两国人民、亚洲各国和世界人民最凶恶的共同敌人。粉碎岸信介同美帝国主义在远东策划新的侵略和战争的阴谋，不仅是日本人民的任务，也是全亚洲、全世界各国人民的共同任务。中国人民愿意同日本人民、亚洲各国人民和世界各国人民在一起，为彻底粉碎美日反动派新的侵略和战争阴谋，确保亚洲和世界的和平而共同奋斗。
    在郭沫若讲话时，会场上不断响起经久不息的热烈掌声。
    廖承志指出：美日反动派新的战争和侵略意图，是中国和亚洲各国人民决不能允许的，也是日本人民坚决反对的
    今天的大会由中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志主持。他在讲话中说，大家都还清楚地记得，在本世纪三十年代和四十年代，日本军国主义在中国及在亚洲其他国家曾犯下了滔天的罪行，使中国人民、朝鲜人民、越南人民、缅甸人民、菲律宾人民、泰国人民、印度尼西亚人民、马来亚、新加坡人民，遭受了惨重的灾害和损失，并且也给日本人民带来了极其严重的祸害。
    他说，第二次世界大战后在亚洲继承日本帝国主义侵略衣钵的美帝国主义，现在又勾结着以岸信介为代表的日本军国主义势力，缔结日美军事同盟。日美军事同盟是为了准备新的侵略和战争，使日本军国主义复活，重新成为对亚洲的现实威胁，并把日本人民再一次拖上战争灾难的道路。美帝国主义要把日本纳入美国的原子战略体系，企图形成以中国、苏联和全亚洲人民为敌的核战争基地网。并使日本成为美日在亚洲发动侵略性局部战争的总的兵工厂和供应基地。美日反动派的这些罪恶意图，是中国人民和亚洲各国人民所断然不能容许的，也是日本人民所坚决反对的。1月14日我国外交部严正声明，反对日美军事同盟，完全表达了中国人民的态度和意志，我们坚决拥护我国政府的这一声明。
    廖承志说，日本人民的斗争不是孤立的，它是亚洲和世界人民反对侵略、保卫和平事业中的一个重要部分，他们得到中国人民、亚洲各国人民和全世界一切爱好和平人民的广泛支持。岸信介之流的日本军国主义分子一定得不到好下场。美帝国主义终有一天要被日本人民赶出去。日本人民要求独立、民主、和平、中立的愿望，一定能够实现。
    日本和平人士西园寺公一先生表示：日本人民坚决要为争取从美帝国主义的战争和侵略体系中解放出来斗争到底
    日本和平人士西园寺公一先生出席了今天的大会。当他在大会上讲话的时候，全场掌声雷动。他代表为阻止修改日美安全条约、阻止实现日美军事同盟，全力以赴地进行着斗争的日本人民，向中国人民表示深深的感谢，感谢中国人民一贯强力地支持他们的斗争。他说，日本人民正燃烧着愤怒的烈火，坚信我们所进行的反对修改“安全条约”的斗争是正义的斗争，我们为更进一步加强团结，决心为阻止这个军事同盟条约的批准而进行坚决的斗争。
    西园寺公一先生说，为了阻止修改“安全条约”，日本的工人、农民、妇女、青年、学生、文化人以及其他一切阶层中的爱好和平的人们，正在以更愤怒的心情，加强和扩大统一行动的体制，坚决要为粉碎日美军事同盟体系，为争取日本从美帝国主义的战争和侵略体系中解放出来，走向真正的独立而斗争到底。而且决心为使日本同中国恢复正常邦交，为使日本走向新路，作为一个亚洲和平建设的好成员而坚决斗争到底。他指出：岸信介越是滥用职权，采取高压手段，人民的声势就越发高涨。
    西园寺公一先生说，岸信介集团必定不得人心，更加孤立。日本人民的斗争，决不是孤立无援的，有强大的力量在支持着我们。我们日本人民懂得，正是因为日美军事同盟是敌视中、苏两国，把亚洲各民族做为它的侵略对象，所以日本人民的斗争得到了中、苏两国人民以及亚洲各民族的支持。它增加了我们日本人民的斗争勇气。
    西园寺公一先生的讲话，不时被全场春雷般的掌声打断。
    各民主党派和人民团体负责人表示热烈拥护我国政府的1月14日声明，全力支持日本人民的正义斗争
    各民主党派和人民团体的负责人相继在会上讲话，他们坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，热烈拥护1月14日我国政府反对日美军事同盟的严正声明，并且表示全力支持日本人民的正义斗争。
    民革副主席张治中说，我们坚决反对日美军事同盟条约。这个条约，是日美反动派强加在日本人民身上的一副战争枷锁，也是它们进一步奴役日本人民的一个罪恶工具。这个条约，是日本反动派和美帝国主义准备新的侵略和战争的一个极其严重的步骤，是对亚洲各国人民的挑衅，也是对世界和平的挑衅。我们中国人民坚决站在日本人民一道，全力支持日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的正义斗争，向英勇不屈的日本人民致以热烈的敬意。并且认为，制止日本军国主义的复活，制止美日反动派在远东进行新的侵略和战争，这是全世界爱好和平的人民，特别是亚洲各国人民一个共同的神圣责任。
    民盟副主席杨明轩说，中国人民坚决反对日美军事同盟，决不容许日本军国主义破坏亚洲的和平。我们决心要和日本人民、亚洲各国人民一道，为反对日美军事同盟，为保卫亚洲和世界和平而奋斗到底。我们坚信，只要日本人民和亚洲人民团结一致，坚决斗争到底，美帝国主义和岸信介反动集团任何形式的战争侵略政策，都将遭到彻底的失败，全世界爱好和平的人民一定能取得胜利。
    民建主任委员黄炎培说，我们曾经饱受过日本军国主义侵略的祸害。因此，我们完全清楚地认识到日本军国主义复活的严重意义。日本的军国主义势力是中国人民的敌人，是亚洲各国人民的敌人，也是日本人民的敌人。现在美帝国主义者竟然公开扶植这个罪恶势力，这就使我们中国人民、亚洲人民、日本人民不能不起来更加坚决地同美日反动派斗争到底。美日反动派所作所为，唯一能得到的结果，是加快地为自己掘坟墓。
    全国总工会副主席刘长胜说，日美军事同盟条约是一个露骨的以中国、苏联和全亚洲人民为敌的侵略性军事同盟，是以岸信介为代表的一小撮日本垄断资本借助美国的力量，企图恢复“大东亚共荣圈”侵略计划的最露骨的表现，是美国“假和平、真备战”加剧亚洲紧张局势的新的重要步骤。它严重地危害着亚洲与世界的和平。因此饱受日本军国主义侵略祸害的中国工人和人民，自然不能不对此加以严重的警惕。他又说，尽管日本人民的斗争还将是长期的，曲折的和艰巨的，但是日本人民决不是孤立的，中国工人和人民永远支持日本人民的正义斗争，亚洲和全世界一切爱好和平的人民都站在日本人民的一边。我们深信日本工人和人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争一定要取得最后胜利。
    全国妇联副主席李德全说，美日统治集团悍然不顾日本人民的反对，不顾全世界爱好和平的各国人民的反对，签订了美日军事同盟条约。中国妇女对这件事情表示极大的愤慨，同时，对日本人民和妇女为反对这一条约再接再厉地进行斗争，表示崇高的敬意。她说，美日军事同盟条约的签订，标志着日本军国主义的复活，以岸信介为代表的日本垄断集团又妄想借此重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦。中国和亚洲各国的人民是不会忘记日本军国主义者过去进行的侵略战争所造成的祸害的。中国人民和中国妇女绝不容许日本军国主义的复活，也绝不允许日本军国主义者破坏亚洲的和平。
    全国青联副主席张超说，日美军事同盟的签订，是美日反动派在亚洲制造紧张局势，严重地威胁着亚洲各国的安全。这就完全揭穿了最近美帝国主义所标榜的和平的真面目。当前严重的事实是，以岸信介为代表的日本军国主义势力已经复活，日本正在被美日反动派拖向侵略和战争的道路。这是日本人民坚决反对的，中国人民坚决反对的，也是亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民坚决反对的。他说：只要日本青年和日本人民在一起，顽强地坚持斗争，就一定能够取得最后的胜利。时代已经变了，美日反动派的任何猖狂和嚣张，都挽救不了它早已注定了的死亡命运。美帝国主义必将被日本人民赶出去。
    全国文联副主席茅盾说，现在，日美反动派已经勾结起来，日本军国主义已在借尸还魂，美帝国主义已把日本绑在他的战车之上，毁灭的阴影笼罩日本，侵略矛头指向中苏，亚洲和世界和平遭到了严重的威胁。我们一定要击退这股逆流。他说：饱受战争灾难的日本人民已经举起了正义的铁拳，抗议的声浪犹如火焰。他们为争取独立，保卫和平进行了坚持不懈的斗争。在这伟大斗争的行列中，还有我们文艺界的同行——日本文艺界先进的人士，他们利用文艺作为武器，为着崇高的事业进行着顽强的斗争。我们中国人民，坚决支持他们的斗争，并向他们致敬。
    所有这些讲话都激起了一阵又一阵的欢迎掌声。
    大会最后在雷鸣般的掌声中一致通过决议，表示中国人民坚决反对日美军事同盟和完全支持日本人民的正义斗争。
    参加大会的，还有各民主党派、人民团体的负责人和首都著名人士陈叔通、包尔汉、王绍鏊、陈其尤、茅以升、严信民、田富达、区棠亮、郑森禹等。在北京的日本、苏丹、新西兰等国人士也应邀参加了大会。（附图片）
