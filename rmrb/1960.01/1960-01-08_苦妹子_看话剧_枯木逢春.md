    Bitter Sister

    — Watching the Play "A Dried Tree Meets Spring"
    Bitter Sister, Bitter Sister, the name evokes a history of hardship, a child bride since young, then fleeing famine, her father-in-law died by drowning from illness. Conscription scattered her family, mother-in-law, husband, and wife, all separated. To what distant horizon should she go? She drifted to Shuangta Village in Jiangnan.

    Fang Dongge, Fang Dongge, that year, he traveled east and west, escorting his mother. Now, he drives a tractor. Husband and wife reunited with joy, who knew Bitter Sister was so deeply ill! Raising children and twisting hemp, how could she let her remaining life be wasted in waiting for death? She tearfully advises her husband not to return, preferring to forget herself to avoid passing on the disease!

    Schistosomiasis, schistosomiasis, thousands of households desolate, people on the brink of despair. The high tide of rural cooperation rises, but production is hampered by the scourge of the epidemic! The leader cares, the Party mobilizes, to eliminate disaster for the people. Cadre Luo Shunde is transferred, a schistosomiasis prevention station is established in Tacun. Doctors and the masses are mobilized, focusing on both treatment and snail eradication. Braving rain and night, they forget fatigue, using every possible means to eliminate the disease.

    Shuangta Village, Shuangta Village, more than ten thousand people are afflicted, eliminating the disease is not just for a few individuals. Dongge studies snail eradication methods, traditional Chinese medicine can make ancient prescriptions new. Combining Chinese and Western medicine to seek a radical cure, even patients with advanced illness are restored to health. Reunion is still under the red plum blossoms, celebrating the spring of a thousand-year-old withered tree together. Wielding silver hoes and iron arms in production, singing the triumphant song "Farewell to the God of Plague."

    A Dried Tree Meets Spring, A Dried Tree Meets Spring, the people deeply feel the Party's kindness. Saving thousands of Bitter Sisters, the medical achievements are truly astonishing. Today there are no more Bitter Sisters, the masses will not tolerate the existence of disease! If only we can muster the soaring energy, all pests and diseases will surely be eradicated. After watching the play, I cannot sleep, and late at night, I write this Bitter Sister poem. I address my words to all medical and health comrades, strive to learn from Shuangta Village.

    苦妹子
  　王昆仑
    ——看话剧“枯木逢春”
    苦妹子，苦妹子，称名可想辛酸史，幼年童养又逃荒，公爹染病投河死。抓丁冲散一家人，婆媳夫妻一旦分。茫茫天涯何处去？流落江南双塔村。
    方冬哥，方冬哥，当年奉母走东西，今来驾驶拖拉机。夫妻相遇方欣喜，谁知苦妹病深矣！为人育儿复搓麻，岂令余生空待死？忍泪劝哥勿复来，为免传人宁忘己！
    血吸虫，血吸虫，万户萧疏人欲空。农村合作高潮起，生产无如疫疠凶！领袖关怀党动员，要为人民除灾难。调来干部罗舜德，塔村成立血防站。发动医生与群众，治疗灭螺双着重，雨夜奔波忘劳苦，百计千方为除病。
    双塔村，双塔村，患者何止万千人，除病非因少数身。冬哥钻研灭螺法，中医能使古方新。中西合作求根治，晚期重病尽回春。团圆仍在红梅下，共庆千年枯木春。银锄铁臂事生产，高歌一曲“送瘟神”。
    枯木春，枯木春，人民尽感党情深。救得万千苦妹子，医疗成就实惊人。今日已无苦妹子，万众难容疾病存！但能鼓足冲天劲，诸虫百病定除根。观剧归来眠不得，深夜书成苦妹吟。寄言医卫诸同志，努力来学双塔村。
