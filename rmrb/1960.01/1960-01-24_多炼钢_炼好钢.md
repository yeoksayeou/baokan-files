    Produce More Steel, Produce Good Steel
    Ma Duanqing, Director of the Converter Workshop, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, National Advanced Collective Representative
    Just as we were watching the molten steel by the converter, the good news that the Five-Year Plan had been completed in two years came over the loudspeaker, and everyone jumped for joy. The great achievements of the rapid development of the national construction undertaking have brought us new encouragement and strength. We are determined to work even harder, and on the basis of overfulfilling last year's steel production task by 7.2%, we will produce more than twice the average quarterly output of high-quality steel in the first quarter of this year.
    Since New Year's Day, a lively steel-winning relay race has been launched in our workshop, and we have achieved excellent results of a good start and daily progress. The production level and the qualification rate of steel ingots have exceeded those of December last year, and we have also broken the highest daily production record. In order to raise the production level even higher this year, we must carry out socialist labor competitions more deeply and extensively, and further promote advanced experience around the key to production. Now, we are preparing to convert some pig iron furnaces into blast furnaces, connect fans in series, and increase the furnace opening rate and pig iron production rate to ensure that the converters are well-fed. At the same time, we will incorporate some effective advanced experiences into the operating procedures so that they can be fully implemented. In terms of converter operation, we will install instrument control operation and adopt new technologies such as oxygen steelmaking in converters.
    Our workshop achieved great results in the Great Leap Forward in 1959, and the utilization coefficient of the converter reached the national advanced level. We must continue to humbly learn from the advanced experience of brother factories, and improve the indicators such as pig iron consumption to the advanced level, and strive for a greater, better and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

    多炼钢　炼好钢
    全国先进集体代表石景山钢铁公司转炉车间主任  马端卿
    正当我们在转炉边看钢水的时候，播音器里传来五年计划两年完成的好消息，大伙儿高兴得跳起来了。国家建设事业迅速发展的伟大成就，给我们带来了新的鼓舞和力量，我们决心再加一把劲，在超额7．2％完成去年钢产任务的基础上，今年第一季度要炼出相当于去年
  季平均产量两倍多的优质钢。
    从元旦起，我们车间里展开了热火朝天的夺钢接力赛，取得了开门红、日日红的优良成绩，生产水平和钢锭合格率都超过了去年12月份，并且刷新了日产最高纪录。为了在今年把生产水平提得更高，我们要更深入广泛地开展社会主义劳动竞赛，围绕生产关键，进一步推广先进经验。现在，我们正准备把部分化铁炉高炉化，串联风机，提高开炉率和化铁率，保证转炉吃饱吃好。同时，把一些行之有效的先进经验纳入操作规程，使它全面开花。在转炉操作方面，我们要安装仪表控制操作，并且采用转炉加氧炼钢等新技术。
    我们车间在1959年大跃进中取得了很大成绩，转炉的利用系数达到了全国先进水平。我们要继续虚心学习兄弟厂的先进经验，把生铁消耗等指标也提高到先进水平，争取今年更大更好更全面的跃进。
