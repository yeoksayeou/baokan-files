    Transferring Capable Cadres to Pig Farms
    Suizhong County Transfers Over 500 Cadres and Leaders to Raise Pigs

    (Reported by our newspaper) Pig production in Suizhong County, Liaoning Province, has developed rapidly. By the end of November 1959, the county had 208,970 pigs, an increase of 92.7% compared to the beginning of the year, averaging three pigs per household. The county has sold 20,000 head of fattened pigs to the state and supported other areas with 3,500 piglets.

    The importance attached by the entire Party, the assignment of dedicated leaders from top to bottom, and the establishment of a strong pig production front are important reasons for the rapid development of pig production in Suizhong County. The county party committee designated a secretary and a county head specifically to oversee pig production; each people's commune, production brigade, and team also assigned a secretary or team leader to regularly manage pig production. In order to strengthen the pig production front, in the spring of 1959, each people's commune transferred more than 500 backbone personnel from other fronts to take on leadership roles in pig production. Currently, all 880-plus collective pig farms in the county are equipped with farm managers, and larger pig farms have even established Party branches, improved organizational structures, and formed teams for feeding, feed distribution, manure collection, and disease prevention.

    把得力干部调到养猪场
    绥中县调五百多名干部领导养猪
    本报讯　辽宁省绥中县养猪生产发展很快，到1959年11月底，全县养猪二十万八千九百七十头，比年初增加92．7％，平均每户养猪三头。已卖给国家肥猪两万头，支援外地仔猪三千五百头。
    全党重视，从上到下固定专人领导，建立一条强有力的养猪生产战线，是绥中县养猪生产获得迅速发展的一个重要原因。县委确定一名书记、一名县长专管养猪生产；各人民公社、生产大队、小队都固定了一名书记或队长经常抓养猪生产。为了充实养猪生产战线，1959年春天各人民公社从其他战线抽调了五百多名骨干力量，放到养猪生产战线上做领导工作。目前全县八百八十多个集体养猪场都配备上了场长，较大型的猪场还设立了党支部，健全了组织机构，组成了饲养组、饲料调剂组、积肥组和防疫组等组织。
