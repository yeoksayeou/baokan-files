To strengthen agricultural technical forces through two-pronged approach:
    Shenyang Agricultural College Runs Training Classes and Seminars for People's Communes
    A Brigade in Jilunzhai Commune Develops Talent Through Self-Reliance

    (Our Dispatch) Shenyang Agricultural College has vigorously supported agricultural technical transformation in conjunction with teaching over the past two years. It has held more than ten types of specialized seminars and training classes for rural people's communes in Liaoning Province, cultivating a large number of agricultural technical backbones and production management cadres.
    Utilizing its existing faculty and equipment, Shenyang Agricultural College has held short-term seminars and training classes in more than ten specialties, including agricultural technology, tractor operation, fruit tree grafting, plant diseases and insect pests, animal husbandry and feeding, and biogas utilization for rural people's communes in Liaoning Province over the past two years. Participants included not only labor models, advanced producers, and skilled producers recommended by people's communes from various locations, but also cadres from cities, counties, districts, communes, management areas, and production teams in Liaoning Province, totaling more than 1,100 people. They not only learned a great deal of advanced agricultural scientific knowledge and production skills, but also improved their ability to guide and organize agricultural production through summarizing practical production experience.
    Shenyang Agricultural College also organized nearly a hundred various professional work groups, which successively went deep into the rural areas of Liaoning Province to conduct investigations and summaries of high-yield experiences, general agricultural technology training, soil surveys, seaweed fertilizer surveys, pest and disease surveys, water conservancy surveys, and peat resource surveys, and brought agricultural science and technology to the doorsteps, training a large number of agricultural technical backbones for the communes.
    Shenyang Agricultural College also helped Gaokan People's Commune in Shenyang City establish an Agricultural Science Research Institute, an agricultural middle school, an animal breeding station, a tractor station, crop seed farms, and fruit tree and tree nurseries, and trained more than 280 farmer-technicians.

    (Our Dispatch) Hefei, January 10th. Over the past year, the Jilunzhai Brigade of Jilunzhai Commune in Woyang County, Anhui Province, has self-reliantly cultivated 364 various types of technical personnel in areas such as tractor driving, agricultural tool repair, water pump operation, rice cultivation, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. This is a fivefold increase compared to the advanced cooperative stage.
    The main methods used by the Jilunzhai Brigade to cultivate technical forces are "selection," "dispatch," "invitation," and "assistance." "Selection" means selecting commune members with certain skills, forming specialized teams according to their specialties, or assigning them to relevant factories or farms to participate in production. For example, more than ten commune members with fish farming experience who were selected to work at the fish fry farm improved their skills through a period of study and practice, and also mastered the technology of breeding fish fry.
    "Dispatch" means sending commune members with awareness and a certain level of education to study in other places. In one year, the brigade, based on the principle of developing what is needed for production, dispatched people to Fuyang County to learn how to operate water pumps, to Funan County to learn beekeeping, and to Woyang County's epidemic prevention station to learn animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, with very good results.
    "Invitation" means hiring people with technology and experience from other places to be teachers and impart technology. For example, when the brigade wanted to develop black carp (softshell turtle) production but lacked specialized talent, it invited skilled workers from other brigades to work and train apprentices at the same time. In the past year, it not only established a black carp farm and captured 3,000 black carp, but also successfully tested breeding methods.
    "Assistance" means that veteran workers help new workers, skilled workers help novices, and everyone teaches and learns from each other. For example, the silkworm farm originally had only eight veteran workers. Due to the adoption of the method of combining old and new, most of the more than 80 employees in the entire farm have learned silkworm farming techniques.

    双管齐下壮大农业技术力量
    沈阳农学院为人民公社办讲习班训练班
    纪伦寨公社一个大队自力更生培养人才
    本报讯　沈阳农学院两年来结合教学大力支援农业技术改造，为辽宁省农村人民公社举办了十多种专业讲习班和训练班，培养了大批农业技术骨干和生产管理干部。
    沈阳农学院利用现有的师资、设备，两年来为辽宁省农村人民公社举办了农业技术、拖拉机手、果树嫁接、植物病虫害、畜牧饲养和沼气利用等十多种专业的短期讲习班和训练班。参加学习的除了各地人民公社保送来的劳动模范、先进生产者、生产能手、农业技术骨干等以外，还有辽宁省各市、县、区和公社、管理区、生产队的干部，共一千一百多人。他们不仅学到了许多先进的农业科学知识和生产技能，而且通过对实际生产经验的总结，提高了自己指导和组织农业生产的能力。
    沈阳农学院还组织了近百个各种专业工作组，先后深入辽宁省农村进行丰产经验的调查总结、农业技术普训、土壤普查、海肥调查、病虫害调查、水利调查、草炭资源调查等，并把农业科学技术送上门去，为公社培训了大批农业技术骨干。
    沈阳农学院还帮助沈阳市高坎人民公社建立了农业科学研究所、农业中学、家畜配种站、拖拉机站、作物留种田、果树和林木苗圃等，并培训了农民技术骨干二百八十多名。
    本报合肥10日电　安徽省涡阳县纪伦寨公社纪伦寨大队一年多来自力更生地培养了拖拉机手、农具修配手、抽水机手、改种水稻、林、牧、副、渔等方面的各种技术人员三百六十四名，比高级社时激增五倍。
    纪伦寨大队培养技术力量的办法主要是“选”、“派”、“请”、“帮”。“选”，就是选有一定技术的社员，按特长组成专业队，或分配到有关厂、场参加生产。如被挑选到鱼苗场工作的十多个有养鱼经验的社员，经过一个时期的钻研、实践，提高了技术，还掌握了繁殖鱼苗的技术。
    “派”，是派有觉悟和一定文化水平的社员到外地学习。一年中，大队根据生产发展什么，派人学什么的原则，曾分别派人到阜阳县学开抽水机，到阜南县学养蜂，到涡阳县防疫站学畜牧兽医等，收效很好。
    “请”，就是从外地聘请有技术、有经验的人来当老师，传授技术。如大队要发展青鱼（鳖）生产又没有专门人才，就从别的大队请了这方面的能手来边干边带徒弟，一年多来，不仅成立青鱼场，捕捉了三千尾青鱼，还试验成功了繁殖方法。
    “帮”，是老手帮新手、熟手帮生手，互教互学、包教包学。如养蚕场原来只有八个老手，由于采取了新老结合的办法，全场八十多个职工大部已学会养蚕技术。
