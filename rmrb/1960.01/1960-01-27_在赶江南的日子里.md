    In the Days of Catching Up with Jiangnan
    Hu Chunsheng, Secretary of the Shechen People's Commune Committee, Xinghua, Jiangsu

    January 2
    The small steamer sped against the northwest wind on the almost frozen river. I kept checking my watch; it was almost seven o'clock, and I couldn't wait to step into the commune's Party committee.
    Why was I so anxious? It was because today at the Party Committee First Secretary meeting I made a guarantee to the county committee to "work hard for a year and catch up with Jiangnan." So I kept revolving in my mind the question of how to catch up. The boat docked at ten o'clock at night. I didn't even bother with dinner and found several people who had been to Jiangnan to ask about the situation there. Just then, a man named Chen Maosheng from Wu County, Suzhou Prefecture, came to our commune to learn about the development of the aquatic products industry, so I struck up a conversation with him and asked him to introduce the experience of the Great Leap Forward in Jiangnan. He told me that the reason why agricultural production in Jiangnan had developed so quickly was mainly because they had correctly implemented the Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture, and the key was to improve farmland water conservancy. We talked until one o'clock before resting. For some reason, I usually snored as soon as I went to bed, but tonight I couldn't fall asleep. My mind wanted to rest, but my eyes refused, and my brain wouldn't rest either. The scenes of Jiangnan and the enthusiasm of the people of Jiangnan kept flashing through my mind.
    January 3
    As soon as it dawned, I gathered the head of the commune, the head of the water conservancy section, the engineer, and other comrades to discuss important matters while looking at the blueprints. After research and discussion, according to the instructions of the county committee, it was decided to mobilize five thousand people to complete 518,000 cubic meters of earthwork before the Spring Festival to realize the mechanization of farmland irrigation.
    After the tasks were determined, before eight o'clock, we gathered more than 600 cadres, Party members, and Youth League members from all large and small teams in the commune and held a rally to swear an oath to catch up with Jiangnan. At the meeting, the conservative ideas of only being able to do small-scale work and not large-scale work were criticized. The comrades present were full of energy and high morale. In addition to carrying out mass red flag emulation campaigns between teams and individuals, every comrade present also expressed their determination to the commune Party committee, putting forward the heroic slogans of "Never stop until a complete victory is won" and "Not reconciled until we catch up with Jiangnan." Many comrades wrote letters of determination. Chen Fuyun, a member of the Laoshe Brigade, said when expressing his determination to the Party: "We have two roads to Jiangnan. One is the road we took before liberation, supporting the old and carrying the young, begging along the way to Jiangnan. The other is a bright road, that is, we use our own hands to build our hometown as beautiful as Jiangnan. We are determined to take the latter road!"
    January 4
    From today on, our Party committee will move to the construction site to work. A large red flag was raised in the square, with a large "Commander" character embroidered on it. A white sign was hung in front of the door that read "Xinghua County Shechen Commune Water Control Corps." Everyone's titles have also been changed. In the past, people called me Secretary when they saw me. Today, when they see me, they call me Political Commissar. Not only have the cadres changed their titles, but the commune members have also changed theirs. At the construction site, they are not called commune members, but soldiers and combatants.
    Amidst the slogans of catching up with Jiangnan, we saw five thousand light cavalry setting out in the morning glow. Everyone was majestic and high-spirited, carrying backpacks, shovels on their shoulders, raising red flags, singing the song "The People's Commune is Good," and marching with neat and vigorous steps toward the wide fields to set up camp. The department store, clinic, farm tool factory, and all other service units have also moved here. In addition, we have also organized seventy-five ships in the rear for transportation, and eight hundred and fourteen people are responsible for supplying grain and grass.
    January 5
    A battle has begun. Red flags are fluttering at the construction site, songs are shaking the sky, and heroes are charging and showing their power, presenting a lively scene everywhere. The digging team's shovels are flashing white light, the carrying team is flying like eagles, the cart team is shuttling back and forth, and the ramming team is sweating profusely. I was fascinated by their majestic momentum and didn't know what to say, just praising their enthusiasm again and again.
    The working section of the Gao Gui Brigade was in a paddy field with more than three inches of ice. When the shovel poked into it, it was like poking into a stone slab. The commune members were not intimidated by this. They organized five blasting teams to break the ice with stone hammers first. Then, one by one, they took off their shoes and socks, stood in the field, and lifted the ice to remove it and dig mud. Looking at their red legs and feet, I asked them if they were cold. They said in unison, "As long as we have a fiery heart, we are not afraid of the cold!" I and several other comrades inspected the entire construction site, and the situation was very good. So I took off my cotton shoes, borrowed a shovel, and started digging with them. Commune member Chen Yougen challenged me to see who could dig faster and bigger, so the two of us chased each other and refused to let anyone win. All 174 people in the team found opponents, hooked up with each other, and set off a massive emulation craze. After carrying out this movement, the work efficiency of this team increased from 0.4 cubic meters per hour to 0.93 cubic meters, exceeding the quota of 0.53 cubic meters.
    January 6
    Construction has been underway for two days. According to today's acceptance inspection, twenty-eight of the twenty-nine brigades in the entire commune have exceeded their quotas. Not only is the progress fast, but the quality of the projects also meets the standards. The task assigned to us by the county committee during this assault ten-day period is 230,000 cubic meters of earth. It was originally scheduled to be completed in ten days. From yesterday morning to tonight, only two days have passed, and 71,000 cubic meters of earth have been completed, accounting for 30.8% of the task for this assault ten-day period. It seems that the work for this assault ten-day period can be completed in another five days, which makes me extremely happy. No, we cannot be happy too early. Being too early will make us complacent. Chairman Mao has long taught us that modesty makes one progress, and pride makes one fall behind. This made me raise my vigilance and immediately call the cadres of each battalion to study how to take advantage of the victory and pursue the attack in the future. Everyone's opinion is that in the next few days, we should continue to oppose rightist tendencies, boost morale, vigorously engage in mass movements, cadres should take the lead, carry out competitions, work hard and skillfully, continuously check and compare each other, fight fiercely for three days and nights, and strive to complete the ten-day task five days ahead of schedule, so that our hometown can cross the Yangtze River and catch up with Suzhou and Hangzhou as soon as possible!

    在赶江南的日子里中共江苏兴化舍陈公社委员会书记　胡春生
    1月2日
    小轮船迎着西北风，飞驰在快要结冰的河上，一会儿我就看看表，时间快到七点，恨不能立即跨进公社党委会。
    我为什么这样急呢？这是因为今天我在公社党委第一书记会上向县委作了“苦干一年，赶上江南”的保证，于是就不断在脑子里盘旋如何才能赶得上的问题。船靠岸已经是深夜十点钟了，晚饭也没顾得上吃，就找来几个上过江南的人打听江南的情况。就在这时候，苏州专区吴县有位名叫陈茂生的来我公社了解水产事业发展情况，于是我就和他攀谈起来，请他介绍江南大跃进的经验。他告诉我，江南的农业生产之所以发展得快，主要是因为他们正确地贯彻了八字宪法，而关键又是修好了农田水利。我俩一直谈到一点钟才休息，不知怎么的，往日上床就打鼾，今天怎么睡不着呢？心里想休息，眼睛不肯休息，脑子也不肯休息，那些江南的景象啊，江南人民的干劲啊，不断从我的脑海里闪过去。
    1月3日
    天刚亮，我就把社长、水利科长、工程员等同志召集起来，打开蓝图，共谋大事。经过研究讨论，按照县委指示，决定动员五千人在春节前完成五十一万八千立方土方任务，实现农田机灌化。
    在任务确定以后，我们在八点钟前就把全公社所有大、小队干部和党、团员六百多人集中起来，召开了赶江南的誓师大会。会上批判了只能小搞、不能大搞的保守思想。到会同志们都鼓足了干劲，斗志昂扬，队与队之间，人与人之间，除开展了群众性的红旗竞赛运动以外，到会的每一个同志还都向公社党委会表示了决心，提出“不获全胜，决不收兵”，“不赶上江南心不甘”的豪迈口号。许多同志写了决心书。老舍大队社员成福云在向党表示决心时说：“我们通向江南有两条道路，一条是解放前所走的那条路，扶老携幼，沿途求乞到江南，一条是光明大道，也就是我们用双手把自己的家乡建设得像江南一样，我们坚决要走后一条路！”
    1月4日
    从今天起，我们的党委会迁往工地办公。广场上升起一面大红旗，旗上绣着斗大的“帅”字，门前挂上一个“兴化县舍陈公社治水兵团”的白色牌子。大家的职别也改了，往日别人见了我都喊我书记，今天，他们看见我就叫我政委。不仅干部改了名称，就是社员，他们也改了，他们在工地上不叫社员，叫战士、战斗员。
    在赶江南的口号声中，我们看到五千轻骑兵，迎着朝霞出发了。他们每一个人都雄赳赳，气昂昂，背背包，肩扛铁锹，高举红旗，唱着“人民公社好”的歌曲，以整齐健壮的步伐奔向宽阔的田野安营扎寨。百货经理部、卫生所、农具厂等一切服务单位，也都搬到这儿来了。除此而外，我们还在后方组织了七十五条船运输，八百一十四人负责搬粮运草等供应工作。
    1月5日
    一场战斗开始了。工地上红旗招展，歌声震天，英雄们横冲直闯，大显神威，到处呈现出一片热闹景象，挖泥队铁锹闪白光，扁担队如鹰飞翔，车子队来去穿梭，打硪队汗珠直淌。我被他们这磅礴的气势迷住了，不知说些什么是好，只是连连夸赞他们的干劲足。
    高桂大队的工段在水田里，结着三寸多厚的冰，锹戳上去，像戳在石板上一样。社员们没有因此吓倒，他们组织了五个爆破队，先用石鎯头把冰块打碎，然后，一个个脱去鞋袜，站到田里把冰块抬走，挖泥。我看着他们那红红的腿和脚问他们冷不？他们异口同声地说：“只要有颗火热的心，天再冷也不怕啊！”我和其他的几个同志把整个工地检查了一遍，情况都很好，于是我就脱去棉鞋，借来一柄锹随他们一起挖起土来。社员陈友根向我提出挑战，和我比挖得快，挖得大，于是我俩就你追我赶地干，谁也不肯让谁。全队一百七十四人，各找对手，互相挂钩，掀起了一个声势浩大的竞赛热潮。在开展这个运动以后，这个队的工效平均每小时由零点四方上升到零点九三方，超过定额零点五三方。
    1月6日
    开工已经两天了，根据今天验收，全公社二十九个大队有二十八个大队超过定额，不但进度快，工程质量也都合乎规格。县委在这个突击旬内交给我们的任务是二十三万方土，原定十天完成，从昨天早上开始，到今晚才两天就完成了七点一万方土，占本突击旬的任务30．8％，看来再有五天时间就可结束这个突击旬的工作，真使我高兴极了。不，不能高兴得过早，过早会使自己麻痹，毛主席早就教导过我们，虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，从而使我提高警惕，立即把各营干部找来研究今后如何趁胜追击问题，大家的意见，今后几天中，继续反右倾，鼓干劲，大搞群众运动，干部身先士卒，开展竞赛，苦干加巧干，不断互查评比，激战三昼夜，力争十天任务，提前五天完成，使我们的家乡早日跨过长江，赶上苏杭！
