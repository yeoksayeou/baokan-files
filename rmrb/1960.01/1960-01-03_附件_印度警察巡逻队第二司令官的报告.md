    Annex
    Report of the Second Commander of the Indian Police Patrol
    My team arrived at Hot Springs on October 19th and set up a temporary camp there. Before continuing north, Commander Karam Singh sent two policemen and a porter east for reconnaissance the next morning (20th). The police and the porter did not return to camp at the appointed time. Therefore, a patrol team was sent out again in the evening to look for the missing people, but they returned at 11 o'clock at night without finding any of the missing personnel.
    On the morning of the 21st, the commander decided to go out to find the missing people himself, as they might have gotten lost in these inaccessible mountains. Accompanied by the second commander, Diyaji, several staff members, and several policemen, a total of about twenty people, Commander Karam Singh left the camp on ponies at about 10:00 AM. He left instructions for the rest of the team to follow on foot.
    Six miles east of Hot Springs, Karam Singh noticed some hoofprints on the left side of a small hill. So he stopped and waited for the main force to arrive. After the main force arrived, he and Diyaji decided that Diyaji would lead most of the personnel to stay there, while Karam Singh would lead a small team to continue following the footprints to see if there were any invading people nearby.
    Karam Singh went around the left side of the hill without noticing anything unusual and went to a place where the main force could not see him. After a while, Diyaji went forward to see how far Karam Singh's team had gone, but he couldn't see them, obviously because Karam Singh's team had gone down to the riverbed at that time. At this moment, suddenly a Chinese army entrenched on the hilltop opened fire on Diyaji's team. Karam Singh's team was also attacked simultaneously by another team of Chinese entrenched on the opposite bank of the river and by the Chinese on the hilltop. The attackers used mortars and automatic weapons.
    Under this attack, both Karam Singh's and Diyaji's teams tried to take cover and fight back, but they were in a very unfavorable position with no proper cover, so their shooting was ineffective. The Chinese on the hilltop effectively prevented Diyaji's team from going to rescue Karam Singh's team, which was caught in a crossfire.
    After a while, the Chinese, who were obviously larger in number and some of whom were riding horses, advanced from the opposite bank of the Qiangchenmo River and overwhelmed Karam Singh's team with automatic weapons and mortars. The Chinese continued to advance to attack Diyaji's team, at which point the team had no choice but to retreat. As a result, most of Karam Singh's team were wiped out, either killed or captured, with only a few surviving, escaping along the riverbed and over the mountains in the dark.
    At night, Diyaji's team tentatively went to retrieve the casualties, but the Chinese were still entrenched on the hilltop and even remained in position on the 22nd. So Diyaji withdrew all his personnel to Qogzsalu.
    After the conflict, a total of seventeen people, including Karam Singh, went missing. Among them, five people, including the commander and the squad leader, were seen by those who escaped to have been killed by the Chinese.

    印度警察巡逻队第二司令官的报告
    我队在10月19日抵达温泉并在那里建立了临时的营帐。在继续北进以前，司令官卡拉姆·辛格在第二天（20日）早晨派出两名警察和一名挑夫向东进行侦察。警察和挑夫到规定的时间都没有回营。因此到晚上又派出一个巡逻小队去寻找失踪的人，但是他们到夜里十一点钟归队，没有能找到任何一个失踪的人员。
    21日晨，司令官决定亲自出去寻找失踪的人，因为他们可能是在这些无路的丛山里迷了路。司令官在第二司令官迪亚吉、若干参谋人员和若干警察的随同下，共约二十人，在上午十时左右乘小马离营，他留下指示，要我队的其他人员徒步随行。
    在温泉以东六英里处，卡拉姆·辛格注意到在左侧有座小山的地方有些马蹄印。所以他就停止前进，等待大队到来。大队到达后，他和迪亚吉决定由迪亚吉率领大部分人员留在当地，而卡拉姆·辛格则率领一小队人员继续循足迹前进，看看附近是否有入侵的人。
    卡拉姆·辛格绕过左面这座山，没有注意到任何不平常的东西，并且走到大队所看不到的地方去了。过一会儿，迪亚吉走上前去看看卡拉姆·辛格的一队人走得多远了，但是看不到他们，显然这是因为卡拉姆·辛格的一队人那时已经走下河床去了。在这时候，突然间据守在山头的一支中国军队向迪亚吉的这队人开了火。卡拉姆·辛格的一队人也遭到据守在河对岸的另一队中国人和在山顶的中国人的同时攻击。攻击者使用了迫击炮和自动武器。
    在这一攻击下，卡拉姆·辛格和迪亚吉所率领的两队人都想取得掩护和进行回击，但是他们处在非常不利的地位，没有适当的掩护物，因此他们的射击无效。山头上的中国人有效地阻止了迪亚吉的一队人前往援救受两面夹击的卡拉姆·辛格的小队。
    过了一会，在羌臣摩河对岸的显然人数较多并且一部分人是骑着马的中国人向前进逼，并用自动武器和迫击炮压倒了卡拉姆·辛格的小队。中国人继续前进来攻击迪亚吉的一队人，这时这队人没有其他办法，只能撤退。因此，卡拉姆·辛格小队的人员大部被歼，或被打死或被俘虏，只有少数人幸免，乘黑夜沿着河床和越过高山逃出。
    入夜，迪亚吉的一队人试探前往找回伤亡人员，但是中国人仍据守着山头，而且甚至在22日仍然据守着阵地。于是迪亚吉就把他的全部人员撤到错格斯察鲁。
    冲突以后，包括卡拉姆·辛格在内共失踪十七人。其中包括司令官和小队长在内的五人，据逃出的人看到，已被中国人击毙。
