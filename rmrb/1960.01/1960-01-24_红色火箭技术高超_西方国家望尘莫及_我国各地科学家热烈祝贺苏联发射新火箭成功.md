Xinhua News Agency report: According to Xinhua News Agency dispatches, prominent scientists across our country warmly congratulated the Soviet Union on the successful launch of a powerful multi-stage ballistic rocket into the Pacific Ocean, unanimously praising the great achievements of Soviet rocket technology.

Chen Hankui, a professor at East China Normal University who specializes in radio microwave research, said that this multi-stage ballistic rocket landed within a range of less than two kilometers from the predetermined landing point according to the planned schedule. This fully demonstrates the high degree of accuracy achieved by the Soviet Union in rocket control, and new achievements have been made in automatic control technology and space communications in radio electronics. The success of this rocket launch also shows that a new way has been found to solve the problem of long-distance communication that must be resolved for traveling to planets in the solar system.

Yan Dongsheng, a researcher at the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that such a powerful rocket, with such a huge thrust from the propulsion unit, means that the Soviet Union has used higher-energy fuels and developed materials that can withstand the higher temperatures generated by high-energy fuels. The temperature of the surface of the rocket's final stage model as it passes through the dense atmosphere is even higher, and the Soviet Union has also found a solution to ultra-high temperature materials that can adapt to such complex conditions, demonstrating that Soviet rocket technology has reached a high level in all aspects.

Su Buqing, Vice President of Fudan University and mathematician, Li Guohao, Vice President of Tongji University and expert in mechanics, and Yu Tongyin, professor at Fudan University and director of the Institute of Polymer Science, jointly issued a written statement. They enthusiastically pointed out that the Soviet Union's successful launch of a multi-stage ballistic rocket is another brilliant achievement following the successful launch of three space rockets in 1959, which captured photographs of the far side of the moon and made great achievements in opening up a new era in world science and technology. It is also a victory for peace-loving people all over the world.

Li Guoping, a mathematics expert who is attending the Hubei Provincial Science and Technology Plan Work Conference in Wuhan, said: "The Soviet Union's successful launch of a multi-stage ballistic rocket into the Pacific region once again proves that Soviet science and technology is far ahead in the world, and American imperialism is being left far behind. This is another great contribution by the Soviet Union to world peace. At present, American imperialism is selling fake peace everywhere, secretly carrying out arms expansion and war preparations, and openly reviving Japanese militarism. This action, which intensifies international tensions, will inevitably go bankrupt completely!" Dai Chunzhou, a professor in the Department of Physics at Wuhan University, said: "The accurate arrival of this high-speed rocket in the predetermined area, and the fact that the entire rocket's flight and activities at all stages conformed to the original plan, show that the Soviet Union has reached the world's most advanced level in radio electronics, computer technology, automation, and jet technology. As a physical science researcher, I must strive to learn from the Soviet Union and strive to develop China's science and technology at high speed."

Professor He Xinfa, director of the Physics Department of South China Normal College, said that the Soviet Union's launch of a multi-stage ballistic rocket is itself a great achievement of comprehensive science. Only when the scientific and technological aspects of spraying, radio, mathematics, physics, metallurgy, materials, etc. have reached a high level can a multi-stage ballistic rocket be accurately launched. The success of this multi-stage ballistic rocket launch by the Soviet Union has prepared the way for the launch of heavy earth satellites and the realization of human space flight to planets in the solar system, indicating that the Soviet Union has reached a new stage in conquering outer space. This achievement of the Soviet Union proves that Soviet science is the most advanced in the world, and it greatly overwhelms the United States.

Zhong Ji, a lecturer in the Mathematics Department of South China Normal College, said that it is more difficult for a Soviet multi-stage ballistic rocket to accurately hit a predetermined target than for a lunar rocket to hit the moon. This is because the moon is large in volume, and after the rocket enters an altitude of 100 kilometers, it enters orbit and is not affected by atmospheric resistance. However, a multi-stage ballistic rocket is affected by air resistance, especially the effects of high-altitude airflow and the Earth's rotation, in its final low-altitude flight. Only with extremely good electronic equipment and automatic control systems installed inside the rocket can it hit the target according to the predetermined plan. This shows that the Soviet Union has reached the pinnacle of perfection today in electronics, remote control, and jet propulsion technology. This is beyond the reach of capitalist America.

Liu Junxian, director of the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics at Sun Yat-sen University, said that while the American side is talking about peace, it continues to expand its arms and prepare for war, is unwilling to eliminate nuclear weapons and hinder the conclusion of an agreement to ban nuclear weapons, and is establishing missile bases everywhere on the borders of socialist countries. Recently, it also signed the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty to arm Japan with nuclear weapons and make itself the enemy of the people of the world. This pretended peace cannot deceive anyone. Today, the Soviet people and Soviet scientists have once again made a great contribution to mankind's conquest of the universe. This is the pride of our socialist camp and a major guarantee for the cause of world peace. We should express our warm gratitude to the Soviet people.

Dai Wensai, professor of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy at Nanjing University, said: The news that the Soviet multi-stage ballistic rocket arrived at the predetermined area in the central Pacific Ocean indicates that the first test of a large rocket was successful. It once again shows that Soviet science and technology is developing at an increasingly high speed, and the Soviet Union has far surpassed the United States in rocket technology, automatic control, and long-distance radio communications. He said: The penultimate stage of the first multi-stage ballistic rocket successfully launched on the 20th, together with the model of the final stage, already reached a speed of more than 26,000 kilometers per hour (i.e., more than 7.2 kilometers per second). In the future, when a real final-stage rocket is installed, the speed will definitely be greatly increased beyond the second cosmic velocity. This will create conditions for flying to Mars, Venus, and other planets.

Zhang Yuzhe, director of the Nanjing Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: Powerful multi-stage ballistic rockets are of paramount importance in the conquest of outer space and the exploration of planetary surfaces. They can enable artificial earth satellites and automatic interplanetary stations to carry more scientific instruments and power sources.

Professor Zheng Yanfen, director of the Physics Department of Sichuan University, said: This Soviet multi-stage ballistic rocket was launched from a location 12,500 kilometers away, and the landing point deviated from the predetermined landing point by less than two kilometers, with a deviation of only 0.016%. Such a high degree of accuracy is not easy to achieve. This shows that the rocket calculation and control system has reached a very high level. In addition, the speed accuracy rate of the space rocket that hit the moon launched in September last year was only 1/10,000, while the speed accuracy rate of this rocket has reached at least 1/12,000. In four months, the speed accuracy rate of the rocket launch has increased by 20%. This shows the leap in Soviet science and technology, which can only be achieved by socialist countries. He said that the successful launch of this multi-stage ballistic rocket is a great encouragement to all peace-loving people in the world.

Zhang Guofan, chairman of the Tianjin Science and Technology Association and president of Tianjin University, said: The multi-stage ballistic rocket launched by the Soviet Union this time not only has greater thrust, but also has unprecedentedly high accuracy. We express our warm congratulations to Soviet science and technology workers.

    红色火箭技术高超　西方国家望尘莫及
    我国各地科学家热烈祝贺苏联发射新火箭成功
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：我国各地著名科学家热烈祝贺苏联向太平洋发射强大多级弹道火箭成功，一致推崇苏联火箭技术的伟大成就。
    对无线电微波有专门研究的华东师范大学教授陈涵奎说，这支多级弹道火箭果然按照预定计划在距预定降落地点不到二公里的范围内降落，这充分说明了苏联对火箭控制上所达到的高度准确性，在无线电电子学的自动控制技术及宇宙通讯上已经取得新的成就。这次发射火箭的成功，也说明向太阳系行星旅行必须解决远距离通讯问题找到了新的途径。
    中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所研究员严东生说，这么威力强大的火箭，推动机组的推力如此巨大，就意味着苏联使用了更高能的燃料，和能够承受高能燃料所发生的更高温度的材料的发展。火箭最后一级的模型在通过稠密大气层时表面所产生的温度是更高了，能够适应于这样一个复杂条件下使用的超高温材料，苏联也已经获得解决，可见苏联的火箭技术在各方面达到了高度的水平。
    复旦大学副校长、数学家苏步青，同济大学副校长、力学专家李国豪和复旦大学教授、高分子研究所所长于同隐三人联名发表了书面谈话。他们热情地指出，苏联这次成功地发射多级弹道火箭，是紧接着1959年成功地发射了三个宇宙火箭，拍摄到月球背面的照片取得开辟世界科学技术新纪元的伟大成就之后，又一个辉煌的成就，也是全世界爱好和平人民的胜利。
    正在武汉市参加湖北省科学技术计划工作会议的数学专家李国平说：“苏联向太平洋地区成功地发射多级弹道火箭，又一次证明苏联科学技术已在世界上遥遥领先，美帝国主义更被远远地抛在后面。这是苏联对世界和平又一次伟大的贡献。目前，美帝国主义正到处贩卖假和平，暗地进行扩军备战，公然复活日本军国主义，这种加剧国际紧张局势的行动，必将彻底破产！”武汉大学物理系教授戴春洲说：“这种高速度飞行的火箭准确地到达预定地区，而且整个火箭的飞行及各级活动符合原定计划，这说明了苏联在无线电电子学、计算技术、自动化、喷气技术等方面都已达到世界最先进水平。作为一个物理科学研究者，必须努力向苏联学习，力争高速度发展我国的科学技术事业。”
    华南师范学院物理系主任何新发教授说，苏联发射多级弹道火箭本身就是一个综合科学的伟大成就。只有在喷射、无线电、数学、物理、冶金、材料等各方面的科学技术都达到高度的水平，才能准确地发射多级弹道火箭。苏联这次发射多级弹道火箭的成功，为发射重型地球卫星和人类实现向太阳系行星的宇宙飞行作了准备，表明苏联已经达到了征服宇宙空间的新阶段。苏联的这一成就，证明了苏联科学是世界上最先进的，它大大压倒了美国。
    华南师范学院数学系讲师钟集说，苏联多级弹道火箭准确地射到预定目标，比起月球火箭射中月球还要困难。因为月球体积大，而且火箭进入百公里高空之后，便进入轨道，不受大气阻力的影响，但是一个多级弹道火箭在它最后一程低空飞行中，要受到空气阻力的影响，特别是高空气流的影响，还有地球自转的影响。只有在火箭内部装置了极为良好的电子设备和自动控制系统，才能按照预定的计划射中目标。这说明了今天苏联在电子学、远距离控制、喷气推进技术等方面都达到了登峰造极的水平。这是资本主义的美国所望尘莫及的。
    中山大学数学力学系主任刘俊贤说，美国方面一边空谈和平，一边却继续扩军备战，不愿意消灭核武器及阻挠禁止核武器达成协议，在社会主义国家的边邻到处建立导弹基地，最近并签订日美军事同盟条约，以核武器武装日本，与世界人民为敌，这个假装的和平是骗不了任何人的。今天苏联人民和苏联科学家又一次对人类征服宇宙方面作出了伟大的贡献。这是我们社会主义阵营的骄傲，也是世界和平事业的重大保障，我们应该向苏联人民表达热烈的谢意。
    南京大学数学天文系教授戴文赛说：苏联多级弹道火箭抵达太平洋中部预定地区的消息，表明大型火箭的第一次试验获得成功。它又一次说明了苏联的科学技术正在以愈来愈高的速度发展着，苏联的火箭技术、自动控制、远程无线电通讯等方面都已经把美国远远地抛在后面。他说：20日发射成功的第一个多级弹道火箭，倒数第二级连同最后一级的模型在一起，时速就已经达到每小时两万六千多公里（即每秒钟七点二公里以上），将来装上真的最后一级火箭，速度一定可以大大超过第二宇宙速度。这就为飞向火星、金星和其他行星创造了条件。
    中国科学院南京紫金山天文台台长张钰哲说：威力强大的多级弹道火箭，在征服宇宙空间和探测星球表面的工作上，具有头等的重要意义，它可以使人造地球卫星和自动行星际站携带更多的科学仪器和电源。
    四川大学物理系主任郑衍芬教授说：苏联这个多级弹道火箭从一万二千五百公里远的地点发射，而降落点偏离预定降落点不到两公里，偏离度仅0．016％，这样高度的准确性是很不容易的。这说明了火箭计算控制系统达到了非常高的水平。另外，去年9月份发射的射中月球的宇宙火箭，它的速度准确率只需万分之一，而这次火箭的速度准确率至少达到一万二千分之一，四个月的时间，发射火箭的速度准确率提高了20％，这说明了苏联科学技术上的跃进，这是只有社会主义的国家才能办得到的事。他说，这次多级弹道火箭发射成功，对全世界爱好和平的人都是很大的鼓舞。
    天津市科学技术协会主席、天津大学校长张国藩说：苏联这次发射的多级弹道火箭不但推力更大，而且准确性也空前高。我们向苏联科学技术工作者表示热烈祝贺。
