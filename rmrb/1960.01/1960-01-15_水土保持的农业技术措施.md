    Agricultural Technology Measures for Soil and Water Conservation

    Soil and water conservation work in the middle reaches of the Yellow River is leaping forward. Currently, nearly ten million people are engaged in soil and water conservation and water conservancy construction on the Loess Plateau, which covers an area of 430,000 square kilometers.
      The purpose of soil and water conservation measures is to weaken
  and eliminate the external forces of raindrop and runoff impact.
    Soil erosion is caused by the external forces of raindrop and runoff impact. The purpose of all soil and water conservation measures is to weaken or even eliminate these two external forces and enhance the soil's resistance to erosion. If the soil's resistance to erosion can be greater than the external force, soil loss can be completely avoided. During heavy rain, raindrops hitting the ground have tremendous kinetic energy. If 20 millimeters of rain falls within 30 minutes (this intensity of rainstorm is common on the Loess Plateau), then 13,340 kilograms of water can fall on one mu of farmland. Assuming the average falling speed of countless raindrops falling within 30 minutes is 10 meters per second, then the total kinetic energy of all raindrops hitting the ground is 68,000 kilograms per meter. If the ground is bare or only sparsely vegetated, then this huge amount of kinetic energy will be completely or mostly consumed in breaking up the aggregates and small soil clods of the topsoil, turning them into tiny single grains, splashing with raindrops to a distance of about one and a half meters, while making the ground water turbid. The turbid water seeps into the soil and is filtered, and the soil pores are blocked by single grains, so the permeability is greatly reduced, and the surface runoff and soil loss are correspondingly greatly increased. If people adopt measures such as grass-crop rotation, grass strip intercropping, and soft embankment grass ridges, because pasture grass has dense stems and leaves, which can provide the ground with good coverage, the pasture grass can almost bear all the kinetic energy when raindrops fall. The rainwater, after eliminating the kinetic energy, flows slowly along the stems of the pasture grass to the ground surface, which will not break the aggregates and small clods on the ground surface. Therefore, the water flowing to the ground surface is almost as clean as rainwater, and it will not block the soil pores after seeping into the soil, so the soil permeability will be greatly improved, and the runoff and soil loss will be correspondingly greatly reduced. The near-ground part of the pasture grass can also hinder surface runoff and reduce the flow rate; the pasture grass has developed roots, which connect soil particles and strengthen the soil's resistance to erosion. Pasture grass produces a large amount of organic matter, which can improve the soil's aggregate structure, thereby enhancing the soil's permeability and water retention capacity.
      The peasant masses have created good
  experience in maintaining soil and water
    The peasant masses of the Loess Plateau have extremely rich experience in soil and water conservation. In the past ten years since liberation, under the leadership and attention of party committees and governments at all levels, a set of agricultural technical measures for soil and water conservation with less labor and quick results have been summarized. If these measures can be adopted in light of local conditions, they will greatly help the current soil and water conservation campaign. The main experiences are:
    Contour Cultivation: Changing downslope plowing to plowing along contour lines forms many horizontal plow furrows on the ground, which can achieve significant soil and water conservation effects. The results of demonstration and promotion of this method in several areas show that it generally increases production by 10% to 15%, and some as high as 25% or more. In low-yield areas, when carried out simultaneously with rational close planting, there is an increase in production of 1 to 1.5 times, and a reduction in soil loss of more than 30%. When contour plowing is implemented on slopes, a hillside plow with a moldboard that can be rotated left and right must be used to turn all the soil down the slope. This has the effect of gradually reducing the slope. The No. 16 hillside plow has been promoted in several areas of the Loess Plateau and is very popular among the masses. This plow is pulled by two heads of livestock and has a plowing depth of about 18 centimeters.
    In addition to cultivation, planting on slopes should also be along the contour lines. After contour planting, in order to more effectively prevent soil and water loss, before the rainy season comes, combine hoeing and weeding to cultivate the soil between the rows to the roots of the crops, connecting them into horizontal furrows and ridges to intercept runoff, and make horizontal soil barriers every one to two meters in the furrows to prevent runoff from concentrating and damaging the soil ridges. According to experiments at soil and water conservation scientific research stations in Suide, Yulin, Dingxi and other places, doing so can generally increase production by 10% to 30%, intercept surface runoff and reduce soil erosion by 50% to 80%.
    Sweet Clover Rotation with Crops: According to measurements, each mu of land planted with sweet clover contains three jin of nitrogen and twelve jin of phosphorus, while each mu of land not planted with sweet clover contains only 1.8 jin of nitrogen and 3.6 jin of phosphorus. Therefore, sweet clover rotation with crops is one of the most effective measures to maintain soil and water, improve soil, and increase fertility. According to experiments conducted by the Soil and Water Conservation Scientific Research Station of Lyuliang County, Shanxi Province, on the slopes of the Yuan area, after rotating corn, millet and potatoes with sweet clover, compared with ordinary cultivated land, surface runoff was reduced by 60% to 68%, soil erosion was reduced by 24% to 68%, and yield was increased by 204% to 435%.
    Pasture grass: Strip Intercropping: In farmland with gentle slopes, generally not exceeding three or four degrees, the use of pasture grass strip intercropping can also achieve the effect of maintaining soil and water and increasing yield. The Soil and Water Conservation Scientific Research Station of Lyuliang County, Shanxi Province, implemented corn and sweet clover strip intercropping on slopes of about three degrees, with each strip being ten meters wide; that is, planting ten-meter-wide corn strips and ten-meter-wide sweet clover strips alternately along the contour lines. The results of the first year's experiment showed that compared with corn monoculture, runoff was reduced by 42%, erosion was reduced by 56%, and yield was increased by 123%. Pasture grass can also be used as fuel, feed, and fertilizer.
    Soft Embankment Grass Ridges: The masses in the Huanxian area of ​​Gansu Province have the habit of building soft embankment grass ridges. This is a good measure to transition sloping farmland to horizontal terraces. While building soft embankments in the farmland, sow alfalfa or other pasture grass seeds on the outer slope of the soft embankment. Then gradually increase the height of the soft embankment year by year, and the grass ridge will widen accordingly. After a few years, the ground becomes level, and pasture grass has grown on the ridges, which not only protects the ridges, but also harvests pasture grass. The amount of mud intercepted by this kind of soft embankment grass ridge reaches 0.3 to 1.2 cubic meters per meter. Through the investigation of more than 80 grass ridges, on the Yuan area with a terrain slope of about three degrees, the spacing between grass ridges is wider, generally about 23 to 100 meters; on the Chuantai land, the spacing between grass ridges is 15 to 30 meters; on the mountainous land, the spacing between grass ridges is 6 to 10 meters. The width of the grass ridge itself is generally 1.5 to 5 meters in the Yuan area, 0.9 to 1.3 meters in the Chuantai land, and 1.6 to 2.9 meters in the mountainous land. The slope of the outer side of the grass ridge is 10 to 40 degrees in the upper part and 5 to 33 degrees in the lower part.
    Alternate Slope Terraces: Turning sloping farmland into horizontal terraces is the most fundamental measure to prevent soil and water loss. If the method of cultivating embankments year by year to form horizontal terraces is adopted, it is easy to be silted up and washed away in the process of formation. If the method of leveling at one time is adopted, it takes a lot of labor, generally 30 to 40 workdays, and in the case of a large terrain slope and a wide field surface, it can be as high as 70 to 80 workdays. Therefore, the speed of development is limited. The use of alternate slope terraces can avoid these shortcomings. When building alternate slope terraces, take soil from the lower part to cultivate the embankment, leveling the lower half and retaining the original slope of the upper half. And build small soil embankments on the outside of the horizontal part to intercept precipitation, and at the same time intercept all the runoff flowing down from the sloping part. Plant crops in the horizontal part, and plant pasture grass or crops on the slope. It only takes five to eight workdays per mu to build this kind of alternate slope terrace, which is much less labor-intensive than leveling terraces at one time. According to experiments conducted by the Suide Soil and Water Conservation Scientific Research Station in northern Shaanxi and the Chengguan Commune in Suide County, in the case of a rainstorm of 95 mm on August 19-20, 1959, this kind of terrace can completely intercept runoff and was not washed away. The yield of millet and sorghum in the horizontal part also reached 200 jin and 339 jin per mu respectively, which is two to three times the yield of ordinary slopes.
    Increasing ground vegetation and building terraces are important measures to prevent
  soil and water loss.
    In general, increasing ground cover is a very important way to prevent soil and water loss. In areas with severe soil and water loss, the period of bareness of the ground lacking cover should be shortened as much as possible. This should be noted when deciding on crop rotation systems. Dense crops such as barley, wheat, and millet have better coverage than row crops such as potatoes, cotton, and corn, and have stronger erosion prevention capabilities. Although the above-mentioned contour cultivation measures can reduce or avoid runoff erosion, raindrop impact erosion still exists in the absence of vegetation on the ground surface.
    On farmland with a large slope, it is not enough to rely solely on planting pasture grass to maintain soil and water. At the same time, land processing must be carried out to build terraces to reduce the slope and shorten the slope length. Because the greater the slope of the farmland, the faster the flow rate of runoff; the longer the slope length of the farmland, the greater the flow of runoff: both will cause an increase in soil loss. According to experiments, soil loss is directly proportional to the 1.4th power of the slope and the 1.6th power of the slope length. In other words, if the slope increases by one time, the soil loss increases by 1.64 times, and if the slope length increases by one time, the soil loss increases by 2.03 times. Therefore, the method of building terraces should be adopted to prevent and control soil and water loss on farmland with a large slope. If the above-mentioned alternate slope terraces are built, because the slope length of the slope part is generally no more than five meters, the amount of soil and water loss is limited, and all the loss is intercepted by the horizontal part below, which improves the water and fertility conditions of the horizontal part, which can significantly increase its yield. If pasture grass can be planted in the sloping part, its soil and water loss can also be reduced. Of course, in areas with sufficient labor, it would be better to level terraces at one time. Whether building alternate slope terraces or leveling terraces at one time, it is necessary to improve work efficiency, so a vigorous tool reform movement should be carried out. At the same time, the cultivation of fast-growing tree species and the improvement of afforestation technology, the selection and breeding of excellent pasture grass and the improvement of grazing systems, and the gully management projects should all be given the same attention in order to achieve the effect of comprehensive management and comprehensive management.

    水土保持的农业技术措施
    中国科学院地理研究所副研究员　　方正三
    黄河中游的水土保持工作正在飞跃前进。目前有近千万人正在四十三万平方公里的黄土高原上，进行水土保持和水利建设工作。
      水土保持措施的目的在于削弱
  和消除雨滴和径流冲击的外力作用
    土壤冲刷是因受到雨滴和径流冲击的外力作用引起的。各项水土保持措施的目的在于削弱甚或消除这二种外力的作用，并增强土壤的抗冲力。若能使土壤的抗冲力大于外力，就可完全免除土壤的流失。暴雨时雨滴打击地面，具有巨大的动能。如果在三十分钟内降下二十毫米的雨量（这种强度的暴雨在黄土高原是常见的），则在一亩农地上可降下一万三千三百四十公斤的水。三十分钟内降落的无数雨滴的平均降速设为每秒十米，则全部雨滴冲击地面的总动能量为每米六万八千公斤。如果地面裸露或只有着稀疏的植被，那么这巨量的动能将全部或大部消耗在击碎表土的团粒和细小土块，使其变成微小单粒，随雨滴激溅到一米半左右远的地方，同时使地面的水变浑浊。浑水渗入土中，受到过滤作用，土壤孔隙就被单粒所堵塞，于是渗透率大大减低，而地表径流和土壤流失量则相应地大大增加了。如果人们采用草田轮作、草带间作、软埝草埂等措施，因牧草具有茂密的茎叶，能给地表以良好的复盖，牧草几乎可承受雨滴降落时的全部动能。消除了动能后的雨水沿着牧草的茎干徐缓地流至地表，就不致打碎地表的团粒和小土块，因此流到地表的水差不多可和雨水一般清洁，渗入土中后亦不会堵塞土壤孔隙，于是土壤的渗透率就会大大提高，而径流量和泥土流失量就会相应地大大减少。牧草的近地面部分还能阻碍地表径流，使流速减低；牧草根部发达，连结土粒，加强了土壤的抗冲力。牧草产生大量有机质，可改善土壤的团粒结构，因而更能增强土壤的透水性和保水力。
      农民群众创造了保持水土的
  良好经验
    黄土高原的农民群众对水土保持有极其丰富的经验。解放以来的十年中在各级党政的领导和重视下，已总结出一套用工少收效快的水土保持农业技术措施。这些措施如能因地制宜加以采用，对目前水土保持运动的开展将有很大帮助。这些主要的经验是：
    等高耕作　改顺坡耕犁为沿等高线耕犁，在地面上形成许多条水平的犁沟，这样能得到显著的保持水土的作用。这个办法在若干地区示范和推广的结果，一般增产10％至15％，有的高达25％以上。在低产区与合理密植同时进行，有增产达一到一点五倍，减少土壤流失量30％以上的。在坡地上实施等高耕犁时，须采用犁壁可以左右旋转的山地犁，才能把土全部向下坡翻转。这样有逐年减缓坡度的作用。十六号山地犁目前已在黄土高原若干地区推广，颇受群众欢迎。这种犁由二头牲口拉，耕深在十八厘米左右。
    在坡地上除耕作外，种植亦要等高。等高种植之后，为了更有效地防止水土流失，可在雨季来临以前，结合中耕除草将行间土壤培到作物根部，连成水平沟垅，截留径流，并在沟内每隔一至二米作横土档，防止径流集中，冲坏土垅。据绥德、榆林、定西等地水土保持科学试验站试验，这样做一般可增产10％至30％，拦蓄地表径流和减少土壤冲刷50％至80％。
    草木樨与农作物轮作　据测验，种过草木樨的地每亩含氮素三斤，磷十二斤，而未种过草木樨的地每亩含氮素只有一点八斤，含磷三点六斤。因此草木樨与农作物轮作是保持水土、改良土壤、提高肥力的最有效的措施之一。据山西省吕梁县水土保持科学试验站在塬上坡地试验，证明玉米、谷子与马铃薯三种作物与草木樨轮作后，比一般耕地减少地表径流60％至68％，减少土壤冲刷24％至68％，提高产量204％至435％。
    牧草　带状间作　在地形坡度和缓，一般不超过三、四度的农地上，采用牧草带状间作亦能收到保持水土、增加产量的作用。山西省吕梁县水土保持科学试验站在三度左右的坡地上实施玉米与草木樨带状间作，带宽各十米；就是沿等高线把十米宽的玉米带和十米宽的草木樨带相间种植。第一年试验结果，比玉米单作，减少径流量42％，减少冲刷量56％，增加产量123％。牧草还可用来作燃料、饲料、肥料。
    软埝草埂　甘肃环县一带群众有修软埝草埂的习惯。这是一种把坡耕地过渡到水平梯田的好措施。在农地内修软埝的同时，于软埝的外坡撒上苜蓿或其他牧草种子。以后逐年加高软埝，草埂就随着加宽。经过几年后，地面变平了，在地埂上都已长着牧草，既保护地埂，还可收割牧草。这种软埝草埂的拦泥量每米达零点三到一点二公方。通过八十多条草埂的调查，地形坡度为三度左右的塬地上，草埂的间距较宽，一般为二十三到一百米左右；川台地上草埂间距为十五到三十米；山地上草埂间距为六到十米。草埂本身的宽度，塬区一般为一点五到五米，川台地为零点九到一点三米，山地为一点六到二点九米。草埂外侧的坡度，在上部为十到四十度，下部则为五至三十三度。
    隔坡梯田　将坡耕地修成水平梯田是防治水土流失的最根本的措施。如采用培地埂逐年形成水平梯田的办法，于形成过程中易于淤平冲坏。如采用一次修平的办法，费工很多，一般需三、四十工，在地形坡度较大，田面较宽情况下，有高达七、八十工的。因此，开展速度受到限制。采用隔坡梯田，就可避免这些缺点。修筑隔坡梯田时，从下方取土培埂，将下半部修成水平，上半部保留原坡面。并在水平部分的外边修筑小土埂以截留降水，同时将有坡部分流下的径流亦全部拦蓄住。水平部分种植农作物，坡面上种植牧草或农作物。修这种隔坡梯田，一亩只花五至八个工，比一次修平的梯田省工多了。据陕北绥德水土保持科学试验站与绥德县城关公社试验，在1959年8月19日至20日一次暴雨九十五毫米的情况下，这种梯田能全部拦蓄径流，未被冲垮。水平部分的谷子与高粱每亩产量还分别达到二百斤与三百三十九斤，为一般坡地产量的二到三倍。
    增加地面植被和修梯田是防止
  水土流失的重要措施
    总的说来，增加地面被复，是防止水土流失的一条极重要的途径。在水土流失严重地区，应当尽可能的缩短地面缺乏被复的裸露期。这在决定作物轮作制时要加注意。密生作物如大麦、小麦、谷子等的复盖度要比中耕作物如马铃薯、棉花、玉米等来得好，防止冲刷能力亦较强。上述的等高耕作措施虽能减轻或避免径流侵蚀，但是在地表缺乏植被的情况下，雨滴冲击的侵蚀依然存在。
    在坡度较大的农地上，单靠种植牧草来保持水土是不够的。同时必须进行土地加工，修成梯田，来减缓坡度和缩短坡长。因为农地的坡度愈大，径流的流速就愈快；农地的坡长愈长，径流的流量就愈大：两者都将引起土壤流失量的增加。据实验，土壤流失量是和坡度的一点四次方以及和坡长的一点六次方成正比。换句话说，如坡度增加一倍，土壤流失量就增加一点六四倍，如坡长增加一倍，土壤流失量就增加二点零三倍。所以应当采用修梯田的方法，来防治坡度较大的农地上的水土流失。如修成上述的隔坡梯田，因其有坡部分的坡长一般不超过五米，水土流失量是有限的，并且全部流失量都为下面水平部分所截留，改善了水平部分的水分和肥力条件，可使其产量显著提高。如能在有坡部分种上牧草，还可使其水土流失量减少。当然在劳力充足的地区，如能一次修平梯田，那是更好。无论是修隔坡梯田或一次修平梯田，提高工效都是必要的，因此应当大力开展工具改革运动。同时，对速生树种的培育和造林技术的改进，优良牧草的选育和放牧制度的改良，以及沟道治理工程等方面，都应予以同样重视，才能收到全面治理和综合治理的效果。
