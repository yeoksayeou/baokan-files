Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: In the first year after the rural people's communes were established, a new situation of all-round development in animal husbandry, led by pigs, emerged across the country. In 1959, the development of pig raising formed an unprecedented upsurge nationwide. In addition, the people's communes also embarked on the path of faster development in raising cattle, sheep, donkeys, mules, horses, chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, and other livestock.

According to statistics at the end of 1959, the number of pigs raised nationwide reached 180 million, completing the original target. This was a 13% increase compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and 2.3 times the highest number of pigs raised before liberation in 1934. After Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee pointed out that pigs were the leader of the six domestic animals, Party committees in various localities vigorously promoted pig raising. The speed of development and the current number of pigs have far exceeded those of large livestock and sheep. In terms of development speed, in the second half of 1959, the people's communes massively developed collective raising by communes, teams, production brigades, and public canteens, and the number of pigs raised increased sharply month by month, soaring by 38% compared with the first half of the year. Historically, the number of pigs in our country was about the same as the total number of large livestock and sheep. Now, the number of pigs has exceeded the number of large livestock by more than double, and also far exceeds the total number of sheep.

Last year, large livestock, sheep, and poultry also developed. The total number of large livestock such as cattle, horses, and mules nationwide reached 85.38 million, an increase compared with 1958. Many regions, such as Inner Mongolia and Jilin, saw relatively large increases. In the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, the net increase of large livestock such as cattle, horses, donkeys, and camels last year was 6%. Jilin Province, which used to have fewer female animals, heavy labor, and slower breeding, also increased by 7% last year. The growth rate of sheep was faster than that of large livestock, with a total number of 112.53 million nationwide. Provinces and regions such as Inner Mongolia and Gansu increased by about 10% compared with the previous year. Last year, the number of poultry nationwide also increased significantly compared with 1958. In many places in Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, and other provinces, the number of chickens, ducks, geese, and other poultry raised last year increased several times compared with the previous year.

A significant feature of the great development of animal husbandry in various localities last year was that areas with higher grain yields also raised more livestock and poultry; and areas with faster development of animal husbandry also had faster rates of grain production increase.

The large-scale collective breeding undertakings of the people's communes are the main reason for the all-round development of animal husbandry in our country. Now, the number of pigs raised collectively by people's communes nationwide has far exceeded that raised privately. In just a few months, the number of pig farms run by people's communes, management districts, production teams, small teams, and canteens across the country reached more than 2 million, many of which are thousand-pig farms and ten-thousand-pig farms. In addition, many livestock farms raising large livestock and poultry farms, veterinary stations, breeding stations, breeding farms, etc., have also been established. The people's communes have only been developing collective pig raising for a year, and already eighteen counties across the country have achieved the target of an average of one pig per person, and four other counties, including Xinle County in Hebei Province, Shenqiu County in Henan Province, Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County in Hunan Province, and Yushan County in Jiangxi Province, have achieved the even higher target of an average of one pig per mu of cultivated land throughout the county. There are even more people's communes that have achieved one pig per mu. According to incomplete statistics, 217 communes and more than 23,000 production teams across the country have reached this target. After the nationwide communization, not only did collective pig raising develop rapidly, but collective poultry raising also developed rapidly. Initially, only the people's communes in Xinyang County, Henan Province, had ten-thousand-chicken mountains, but now it is quite common for people's communes in various places to use barren mountains or beaches to build chicken farms.

In animal husbandry production, the broad masses have accumulated many advanced experiences and made many technical innovations and creations in solving problems such as feed, breeding, feeding management, and disease prevention last year. In order to improve the efficiency of feeding management, save labor, and reduce the intensity of labor, various localities are promoting a series of improved advanced tools and vigorously carrying out technical innovations.

### 以猪为首　六畜兴旺  去年年底养猪头数比上半年增加近四成  牛马骡驴羊鸡鸭兔等也比前年显著增加

    以猪为首　六畜兴旺
    去年年底养猪头数比上半年增加近四成
    牛马骡驴羊鸡鸭兔等也比前年显著增加
    据新华社讯　农村人民公社化后的第一年，全国畜牧业生产出现了以猪为首全面发展的新局面。1959年发展养猪业在全国范围内形成了空前的高潮，此外，人民公社的养牛、养羊、养驴、养骡、养马、养鸡、养鸭、养鹅、养兔等各业也走上了更快发展的道路。
    1959年年底统计，全国养猪头数已达到一亿八千万头，完成了原订的指标，比大跃进的1958年增加了13％，相当于我国解放前养猪最多年份1934年的二点三倍。当毛主席和党中央指出猪为六畜之首后，各地党委大抓养猪事业，发展速度和现在猪的头数都远远超过了大家畜和山绵羊。就发展速度说，1959年下半年人民公社大规模地发展了社、队、生产小队和公共食堂的集体公养，养猪头数逐月猛增，比上半年激增了38％。历史上我国猪的头数，同大家畜、羊的总头数差不多。现在猪的头数已超过大家畜一倍以上，也远远超过了羊的总头数。
    去年大家畜、羊和家禽也有发展。全国牛、马、骡等大家畜总头数达八千五百三十八万头，比1958年有所增加。不少地区如内蒙古、吉林增长比例较大。内蒙古牧区牛、马、驴、骆驼等大家畜去年净增6％。过去母畜少，使役重，繁殖较慢的吉林省去年也增加7％。羊的增长速度比大家畜快，全国总头数已达一万一千二百五十三万头。内蒙古、甘肃等省区比前年都增加了10％左右。去年全国家禽也比1958年增加很多。四川、黑龙江、浙江等省的许多地方去年养的鸡、鸭、鹅等家禽，比前年都有成倍的增长。
    去年各地畜牧业大发展有一个显著的特点，那就是：粮食产量较多的地区，饲养家畜家禽也较多；而畜牧业发展较快的地区，粮食增产的速度也较快。
    人民公社大办集体饲养事业是我国畜牧业全面发展的主要原因。现在全国人民公社集体养猪头数已超过私养很多。短短几个月来，全国人民公社、管理区、生产队、小队、食堂所办的养猪场就达二百多万处，其中不少是千猪场和万猪场。此外还办了很多饲养大家畜的畜牧场和养禽场、兽医站、配种站、繁育场等。人民公社发展集体养猪事业不过一年时间，全国就已经有十八个县全县养猪头数平均达到了一人一头的指标，另外还有河北省新乐县、河南省沈丘县、湖南省新晃侗族自治县、江西省玉山县等四个县，达到了全县按耕地平均一亩一头的更高的指标。养猪达到一亩一头的人民公社更多。据不完全统计，全国已有二百一十七个公社和两万三千多个生产队达到了这个指标。全国公社化后，不仅集体养猪发展快，集体养家禽发展也很快。最初仅有河南省信阳县的人民公社有万鸡山，现在各地人民公社利用荒山或荒滩办养鸡场的已经相当普遍。
    在畜牧业生产中，广大群众在解决饲料、繁殖、饲养管理和防疫等方面，去年出现了不少先进经验，不少技术上的革新和创造。为了提高饲养管理的效率，节约劳力和减轻劳动的强度，各地正在推广一系列的改良的先进工具，大搞技术革新。
