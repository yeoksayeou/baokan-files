    The East Wind Prevails, the West Wind Declines
    Western Countries' Production Situation in 1959 Not Optimistic
    (Our Newspaper Reports) Under the general international situation of the East wind prevailing over the West wind, the industrial and agricultural production of major Western capitalist countries in 1959 remained sluggish, and even declined somewhat. Taking the production of major products such as steel, coal, and grain as examples, it can be seen that their situation is very unfavorable.
    Steel Production: According to estimates by the American Iron and Steel Institute, the United States produced approximately 92 million tons of steel in 1959. Although this is an increase of approximately 7 million tons compared to the economic crisis year of 1958, it is a decrease of 21 million tons compared to 1957. The total steel output of the United Kingdom in 1959, according to the British Iron and Steel Board's announcement on January 13, was 20.2 million tons, an increase of only about 3% compared to 1958, or approximately 600,000 tons, which is only equivalent to its average output for one and a half weeks. This output is 1.5 million tons less than in 1957. The United Kingdom's pig iron production in 1959 was 12.6 million tons, a decrease of 1.7 million tons compared to 1957 and 400,000 tons compared to 1958. According to an announcement by the European Coal and Steel Community on the 8th, West Germany, as a result of expanding its military preparations and external expansion, produced 25.8 million tons of steel in 1959, an increase of 13.3% compared to 1958. France's steel production in 1959 increased by only 3.7% compared to 1958. Japan's crude steel production in 1959, according to the Japan Iron and Steel Federation's announcement on the 13th, increased by 37.1% compared to 1958, but its total output was only over 16 million tons, and the Japanese government had already requested steel companies to lower future steel production targets at the end of last year. According to "Asahi Shimbun" and "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," this is due to difficulties in terms of raw materials and capital.
    Coal Production: According to the December 12, 1959 issue of the American "Business Week," 1959 was "the worst year for the American coal mining industry since 1954." Due to reduced exports and reduced coal consumption caused by the steel strike, the United States' coal production in 1959 was only about 400 million tons. In recent years, the United States' coal production has been at least 50 million tons more than in 1959. The United Kingdom's coal production in 1959 was over 206 million tons. According to the British Ministry of Fuel and Power on the 13th, the United Kingdom's coal production in 1959 decreased by over 9.7 million tons compared to 1958. West Germany's hard coal production in 1959, according to an estimate by Mr. Hafer, general manager of West Germany's "Ruhr Coal Sales Company," will only reach over 114 million tons, a decrease of 7 million tons compared to 1958, or a decrease of 5.7%. At the end of last December, the mines in the Ruhr area still had nearly 18 million tons of unsold coal and coke stockpiled. Mr. Hafer disagreed with the claim that the sales crisis of West German coal had been overcome, and he believed that it was just an "unfounded embellishment of reality." Japan's coal industry also showed a sluggish situation in 1959. According to materials from the "Mainichi Shimbun," Japan's coal production was highest during the war in 1941, reaching 55.6 million tons. After the war, the highest annual output was in 1957, but it did not recover to the 1941 level, only over 52 million tons. Last year, even 1957 was not reached, with an estimated output of only 48 million tons.
    Grain and Cotton Production: American bourgeois newspapers unanimously admitted that the chronic disease of the American agricultural "overproduction" crisis deepened in 1959. The "New York Times" reported that in 1959, the United States' wheat "surplus" reached 1.4 billion bushels, an increase of nearly 8% compared to 1958; the corn "surplus" was 2.1 billion bushels, an increase of more than 30% compared to 1958; the cotton "surplus" was 9.2 million bales, an increase of more than 3% compared to 1958. The "overproduction" of American agricultural products is mainly due to the shrinking domestic market. Currently, the United States is using methods such as forcing agricultural product prices to fall and strengthening foreign sales to alleviate the crisis in agricultural production, which results in reduced farmer income and the bankruptcy of a large number of small farmers. In Italy, the crisis of insufficient agricultural production also deepened in 1959. According to statistics, its wheat production in 1959 decreased by 13.8% compared to 1958, barley production decreased by 5.8%, and rice production decreased by 3.5%. This is one of the evil consequences of the price policy implemented by the Italian government that harms the interests of farmers. In order to strengthen the competitiveness of Italian monopoly capitalists in the international grain market, it has twice reduced grain purchase prices in the past two years, resulting in a large reduction in agricultural income and the bankruptcy of many small and medium-sized farmers.

    东风劲吹　西风日衰
    西方国家1959年生产情况不妙
    本报讯　在东方劲吹西风衰的国际总形势下，西方各主要资本主义国家1959年的工农业生产，仍然处于呆滞状态，甚至有所下降。以钢、煤、粮等主要产品的生产为例，就可以看出它们的情况十分不妙。
    钢铁生产：据美国钢铁研究所估计，美国在1959年钢的生产约为九千二百万吨，虽比经济危机的1958年增加了约七百万吨，却比1957年减少二千一百万吨。英国在1959年钢的总产量，据英国钢铁局1月13日宣布为二千零二十万吨，比1958年只增加3％左右，即约六十万吨，仅相当于它一个半星期的平均产量。这个产量比起1957年来，减少了一百五十万吨。1959年英国的生铁产量是一千二百六十万吨，比1957年减产一百七十万吨，比1958年减产四十万吨。据欧洲煤钢联营机构8日宣布，西德由于扩军备战和向外扩张的结果，在1959年生产了钢二千五百八十万吨，比1958年增加了13．3％。法国在1959年钢的产量，比起1958年只增加了3．7％。日本1959年的粗钢产量，据日本钢铁联盟13日宣布，虽比1958年增加了37．1％，但它的总产量也不过一千六百多万吨，并且日本政府已在去年年底要求钢铁公司降低今后产钢指标。据“朝日新闻”和“日本经济新闻”透露，这是由于原料和资金方面都有困难。
    煤的生产：据去年12月12日一期的美国“商业周刊”透露，1959年是美国“煤矿业自1954年以来情况最坏的一年”。由于出口减少和钢铁罢工引起煤的消费的减少，1959年美国煤产量仅有四亿吨左右。在最近许多年来，美国煤产量都比1959年至少要多五千万吨。英国1959年的煤产量是二亿零六百余万吨。据英国燃料和动力部13日说，1959年英国煤产量比1958年减少了九百七十余万吨。西德1959年的硬煤产量，据西德“鲁尔煤销售公司”总经理哈弗尔估计，只能达到一亿一千四百多万吨，比1958年减少了七百万吨，即减产5．7％。而鲁尔区各矿山，到去年12月底还堆积着销不出去的煤和焦炭将近一千八百万吨。哈弗尔不同意所谓西德煤的销售危机已经克服的说法，他认为那只是一种“毫无根据的粉饰现实”的说法。日本的煤业，1959年也呈现出不景气情况。据“每日新闻”的材料，日本煤战时以1941年的产量最高，到达五千五百六十万吨。战后1957年的年产量最高，但也没恢复到1941年的水平，只有五千二百多万吨。而去年连1957年也没赶上，估计只有四千八百万吨。
    粮、棉产量：美国资产阶级报刊一致承认，美国农业“生产过剩”危机的痼疾，在1959年是更加深重了。“纽约时报”报道，1959年美国小麦的“过剩量”达到十四亿蒲式耳，比1958年增加将近8％；玉蜀黍的“过剩量”为二十一亿蒲式耳，比1958年增加30％以上；棉花的“过剩量”为九百二十万包，比1958年增加3％以上。美国农产品“生产过剩”，主要是由于国内市场萎缩造成的。目前美国在用迫使农产品价格下跌和加强外销的办法来减轻农业生产上的危机，其结果是农民收入减少，大批小农户破产。在意大利，1959年农业生产不足的危机也加深了。据统计，它的小麦产量1959年比1958年减少13．8％，大麦减产5．8％，大米减产3．5％。这是意大利政府执行的损害农民利益的价格政策的恶果之一。它为了加强意大利垄断资本家在国际粮食市场上的竞争能力，最近两年曾两次减低谷物收购价格，使农业收入大减，许多中小农户破产。
