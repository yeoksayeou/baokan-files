America's Arms Expansion and Financial Difficulties
Zhang Zhenya
    U.S. President Eisenhower's new budget, submitted to the Eighty-Sixth Congress on January 18, is his seventh as president and his last. U.S. leaders have recently expressed their determination to "commit to the cause of peace," but the new budget is no different from previous fiscal year arms expansion budgets. Compared to the current fiscal year, the new budget increases the Department of Defense's military spending by another $50 million, reaching $40.959 billion. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's space program allocation has nearly doubled. New appropriations for "U.S. Aid" have increased by approximately $950 million. The Atomic Energy Commission's spending remains at a high level of $2.7 billion. Most notably, missile funding has increased by $1 billion, reaching a new peak of $8 billion. Expenditures under the so-called "major national security" item again account for 57.1% of the entire budget expenditure, maintaining the wartime record of military expenditure consistently accounting for more than 50% of the budget since the Korean War. If last year the U.S. President stated in his budget message that "expenditures on the procurement of missiles and the development of new weapons and the measurement of the effectiveness of new weapons should be greatly increased," and that the Department of Defense should "continue to study how to use satellites for specific military purposes," then this year his recommendation is to accelerate the "development of the huge thrusters necessary to conquer outer space," and develop and produce "four strategic ballistic missile systems" ("Atlas" missiles, "Titan" missiles, "Polaris" missiles, and "Minuteman" missiles); at the same time, he also requires "more purchases of improved B-42s (B-52 bombers with new turbo engines), procurement of B-58 supersonic medium bombers," and "continued equipping of B-52 squadrons with 'Hound Dog' air-to-ground missiles..."

    It is clear that American decision-makers are trying to buy time and concentrate their efforts on developing long-range missiles, while not relaxing their preparations for "local wars." Eisenhower clearly stated in his budget message that the U.S. military must be "capable of successfully dealing with" "limited emergencies up to a full-scale nuclear war."

    However, wishes are wishes, and realizing such a warmongering plan is not an easy task, especially with the high cost of missile weapons and the increasingly serious U.S. financial crisis today. Washington decision-makers are currently in a dilemma of trying to balance arms and finances.

    The U.S. ruling authorities have always been generous in spending money on armaments, especially missiles, because military strength is the backing for U.S. aggressive diplomacy. Lacking usable intercontinental missiles, today the U.S. Strategic Air Command relies mainly on Boeing B-52 bombers. Not long ago, equipping thirteen air force wings with seven hundred such aircraft and providing all airport facilities cost the Air Force Department over $9 billion. The B-42 bombers that Eisenhower's new budget message proposes to purchase are one-third more expensive than B-52 bombers (at $9 million each). The B-58 supersonic medium bomber mentioned in the message has cost the U.S. Air Force Department nearly $2 billion in research and development alone over the past two years. According to "Fortune" magazine estimates, equipping two air force wings with one hundred expensive B-58s would cost no less than $3 billion.

    However, the cost of ordering aircraft is insignificant compared to the cost of developing missiles. For example, the Army's "Nike-Zeus" anti-missile missile, which the budget message suggests to "continue developing," is estimated to cost $13.5 billion to make it a useful weapon. The research and development costs for "Atlas" and "Titan" ballistic missiles alone are expected to cost the U.S. government $5 billion. The manufacturing costs for "Polaris" and "Minuteman" missiles are also very expensive. According to the U.S. Navy, building a fleet of forty nuclear-powered submarines carrying "Polaris" missiles would cost $6 billion to $7 billion. Manufacturing one thousand "Minuteman" missiles, along with their underground launch sites, could cost $5 billion (an average of $5 million per missile).

    The enormous cost of this is clearly putting heavy pressure on the U.S. federal government budget, especially since the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force have always been insatiable in developing missiles. They have been involved in as many as fifty missile programs of various sizes. This means that although the U.S. federal government spends more than $40 billion annually, it still cannot meet the Pentagon's demands for weapon development. As the U.S. "Time" magazine stated on November 30 last year: "Almost no one in the U.S. military believes that the $41 billion-plus budget for the 1961 fiscal year will provide the best" or even "sufficient defense." The reason is: "The Army's 'Nike-Zeus' anti-missile missile is a weapon system that will cost an unprecedented $13.5 billion to be effective, but the system is progressing slowly and costs $300 million a year." "The electronic network of the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, designed to search for approaching enemy bombers for 'Bomarc' surface-to-air missiles and other air defense weapons, has already cost $1.2 billion but is not yet fully operational..." But despite the military's dissatisfaction, due to huge military expenditures, financial deficits appear year after year, and inflation is spreading relentlessly.

    Not to mention distant history, let's just look at the situation since Eisenhower became president. In 1953, the year of the U.S. defeat in the Korean War, the U.S. federal government's national debt was $266 billion. After years of huge military expenditures and deficit accumulation (with a deficit of $12.5 billion in the 1959 fiscal year alone), the national debt has recently reached $291 billion. This means that the national debt has increased by another $25 billion. As the national debt increases, the interest burden also increases. In 1953, interest expenses in the budget were $6.5 billion, accounting for slightly less than 10% of total expenditure. In the new fiscal year, this burden is expected to increase to $9.6 billion, accounting for 12% of total expenditure. Under these circumstances, the continuous rise in domestic prices is of course unavoidable. Since Eisenhower came to power, the price of daily necessities has actually risen by 10.7%. The purchasing power of each dollar is now only equivalent to 47.3 cents in 1939. It is estimated that it will continue to fall to 46.5 cents in a year.

    Recently, the consequences of inflation have presented some very real problems to the U.S. financial authorities. With rising prices and rising interest rates, the Treasury Department's long-term treasury bonds, due to legal restrictions on excessively raising interest rates, have finally become unsaleable. In order to repay the constantly maturing national debt, the financial authorities have had to resort to issuing short-term bonds to deal with the emergency. Treasury Secretary Anderson has described this situation as an "extremely dangerous situation."

    The devaluation of the dollar at home has created distrust of the dollar abroad, coupled with the unfavorable foreign trade conditions caused by rising domestic prices, has become the main factor contributing to the large outflow of gold, leaving U.S. officials in charge of finance at a loss and unable to cope.

    Of course, the heavy military expenditure is the main cause of inflation, and this is clearer to the U.S. authorities than anyone else. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Humphrey, who resigned in 1957 due to opposition to excessive military expenditure, warned before leaving office that "even if weapons are important to U.S. security, our economy must also remain healthy." Before the formulation of this new budget, the current Treasury Secretary Anderson, in view of the serious financial situation, also tried his best to oppose excessive increases in military expenditure. Even Eisenhower himself had to say in his budget message: "We must resolutely use our resources prudently" to prevent inflation. He also solemnly pointed out in his State of the Union address: "The damage caused by inflation is endless," "We must fight inflation," "Only by doing so can we prevent it from destroying our salaries, savings, pensions and insurance..."

    It can be seen that U.S. decision-makers are actually aware that the road they are taking of arms expansion and war preparation will become narrower and more dangerous. The "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, which has close ties with the U.S. ruling authorities, recently predicted that "whoever becomes the next (U.S.) president will encounter difficulties, and huge difficulties. These are: budget difficulties, tax difficulties, labor problem difficulties, dollar problem difficulties..."

    This unpleasant prospect will obviously not make U.S. imperialism lay down its butcher knife. In the new budget message, in order to expand arms and prepare for war, it still does not hesitate to compress civil expenditure, does not hesitate to demand "increased taxes on highways and aviation fuel and increased postal rates," does not hesitate to make various adjustments to the military budget to concentrate efforts on developing intercontinental missiles, does not hesitate to ask labor to exercise self-restraint on wage demands, and pins its tax hopes on an "unprecedented prosperity" in the United States. In addition, it also strongly demands that its Western European "partners" "divide the labor" with the United States, to share more of the military expenditure, to develop short-range missiles. In the words of U.S. Defense Secretary Gates at the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council, it is "expanding the scope of jointly shared weapons costs...". The American aggressors' reckless arms expansion and war preparation will only bring greater financial difficulties, which is tantamount to drinking poison to quench thirst!

    美国的扩军备战和财政困难
    张振亚
    美国总统艾森豪威尔1月18日向美国第八十六届国会提出的新预算，是他任总统以来提出的第七个预算，也是他的最后一个预算。美国领导人最近一直表示决心“致力于和平事业”，但是新预算和以前几个财政年度的扩军备战预算却没有什么不同。与本财政年度相比，新预算中国防部的军事开支又增加了五千万美元，达到四百零九亿五百九千万美元。全国星际和空间航行局的空间计划拨款猛增了近一倍。“美援”的新拨款增加了大约九亿五千万美元。原子能委员会的开支仍然保持在二十七亿美元的高水平。最突出的是导弹经费增加了十亿美元，达到八十亿美元的新高峰。所谓“主要的国家安全”项下的开支又占了整个预算开支的57．1％，保持了侵朝战争以来军事开支一直占预算50％以上的战时纪录。如果说去年美国总统在预算咨文中曾表示：“要大大增加采购导弹以及发展新武器和衡量新武器效能方面的支出”，并要国防部“继续研究如何把卫星用于具体的军事目的”，那么今年他的建议则是要加紧“发展为征服外层空间所必需的巨大的推进器”，发展和生产“四种战略弹道导弹系统”（“阿特拉斯式”导弹、“大力神式”导弹、“北极星式”导弹和“民兵式”导弹）；同时，还要求“更多地购买作了改进的B—42（有新的涡轮引擎的B—52轰炸机），采购B—58超音速中型轰炸机”，并“继续用‘猎狗式’空对地导弹装备B—52联队……”。
    美国决策人亟图争取时间，集中力量发展远程导弹，同时不放松对“局部战争”的准备，从这里是看得亟清楚的。艾森豪威尔在预算咨文中也明白表示要求美国的军事力量“必须能够成功地应付”“从有限的紧急事件直到全面的原子核大战”。
    不过愿望总归是愿望，实现这样一个穷兵黩武的计划，却并不是轻而易举的事，特别是在导弹武器昂贵和美国财政危机日益严重的今天。华盛顿决策人目前正处于军备和财务两难兼顾的困境中。
    美国统治当局一向是不吝惜在军备、特别是导弹方面花钱的，因为军事实力乃是美国侵略外交的后盾。由于没有可用的洲际导弹，今天美国战略空军司令部所依靠的主要武器是波音B—52型轰炸机。不久前为了用七百架这样的飞机装备十三个空军联队，并提供全部机场设备，就使空军部花费了九十多亿美元。艾森豪威尔新预算咨文中所建议采购的B—42轰炸机，造价比B—52轰炸机还要昂贵三分之一（每架九百万美元）。咨文中所说的B—58超音速中型轰炸机，过去两年仅在为研究和发展方面就使美国空军部花费了近二十亿美元。据“幸福”杂志估计，用一百架昂贵的B—58装备两个空军联队就非三十亿美元莫办。
    但是把订购飞机的费用同发展导弹的花费相比，却是微不足道的。譬如预算咨文中建议要“继续发展”的陆军“奈克—宙斯式”反导弹导弹，估计要花一百三十五亿美元才能使它成为有用的武器。“阿特拉斯式”和“大力神式”弹道导弹，仅是研究和发展费用，预计将使美国政府花费五十亿美元，“北极星式”和“民兵式”导弹的制造费用也十分昂贵。据美国海军方面估计，将来建立一队四十艘携带“北极星式”导弹的核发动潜水艇，需要六十亿到七十亿美元。制造一千枚“民兵式”导弹，连同它的建立在地下的发射台，可能要花费五十亿美元（平均每枚五百万美元）。
    这样浩大的花费，对于美国联邦政府预算的沉重压力是很明显的，更何况美国陆海空三军对于发展导弹一向是贪得无餍的。它们前后从事的导弹计划大小竟有五十种之多。这就使美国联邦政府尽管每年花用四百多亿美元，仍不能满足五角大楼发展武器的要求。正像去年11月30日美国“时代”周刊所说：在美国军人中，几乎没有人认为，1961财政年度四百一十多亿美元的预算将会提供最好的“或是甚至足够的防卫”。原因是：“陆军的‘奈克—宙斯式’反导弹导弹是一种要花空前未有的一百三十五亿美元才能有效使用的武器系统，但是这种武器系统进展很慢，每年却要花三亿美元”。“目的在于为‘鲍马克’地对空导弹和其他防空武器搜索逼近的敌人轰炸机的半自动防空警报系统的电子网已经花去了十二亿美元，但是还不能充分运用……”可是尽管军人在不满，由于庞大的军费支出，连年出现财政赤字，通货膨胀在无情地蔓延。
    远的不提，单以艾森豪威尔任总统以来的情况说，1953年，即美国侵朝战争失败的那年，美国联邦政府的国债是二千六百六十亿美元。经过了连年的浩大军费和赤字（仅1959财政年度就出现一百二十五亿美元的赤字）的积累，最近国债已达到二千九百一十亿美元。这就是说，国债又增加了二百五十亿美元。由于国债增加，利息负担也随之增大。1953年，预算中的利息费用是六十五亿美元，占总开支的10％弱。而在新财政年度，预计这笔负担将增加到九十六亿美元，占了总开支的12％。在这种情况下，国内物价的不断上涨当然无法避免。艾森豪威尔上台时期，日用品价格实际上已涨了10．7％。现时每一块美元的购买力，只相当于1939年时期的四角七分三厘。据估计，一年之后将续降至四角六分五厘。
    最近一个时期，通货膨胀的恶果已把一些极为现实的问题摆在美国财政当局面前。在物价看涨，利率上升的情况下，财政部发行的长期国库券因过分提高利率受到法律限制，终于变得无人认购。为了偿付不断到期的国债，财政当局不得不用接连发行短期债券的办法来救急。财政部长安德逊已把这一情况惊呼为“极端危险的局面”。
    美元在国内的贬值，造成了国外对美元的不信任，再加上国内物价上涨造成的对外贸易条件的不利，已经成为促使大量黄金外流的主要因素，使负责财政的美国官员们进退失据、无所措手足。
    当然，沉重的军费是通货膨胀的主要原因，这点对于美国负责当局来说，比谁都更为清楚。1957年因反对军费过大而辞职的美国前财政部长汉弗莱，在离职前就曾警告说：“即使武器对美国安全重要，但是我国在经济上也必须保持健康”。在这次新预算制定以前，现任财政部长安德逊鉴于财政情况严重，也竭力反对过多地增加军费。甚至艾森豪威尔本人在他的预算咨文中，也不得不说：“坚决要审慎地使用我们的资源”，以防止通货膨胀。他在国情咨文中还郑重指出：“通货膨胀造成的破坏是没有止境的”，“我们必须同通货膨胀作战”，“只有这样做才能防止它毁灭我们的薪金、储蓄、养老金和保险金……”。
    可见，美国决策人士对于他们所走的扩军备战道路将越来越窄、越来越危险这点实际上也不是不清楚的。同美国统治当局有密切关系的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志最近曾预言：“不论谁当下届（美国）总统，他都会遭到困难，而且是巨大的困难。这些是：预算的困难、赋税的困难、劳工问题的困难、美元问题的困难……”。
    这种不美妙的前景，显然不会使美帝国主义放下屠刀。在新的预算咨文中，它为了扩军备战，仍然不惜压缩民用开支，不惜要求“增加公路和航空燃料的税收并提高邮费”，不惜百般调整军事预算，集中力量发展洲际导弹，不惜要劳工在工资要求上自我克制，并在税收上寄希望于美国将出现一次“空前的繁荣”。此外，它还强要西欧“伙伴”和美国“分工”，更多地分担军费，去发展短程导弹。用美国国防部长盖茨不久前在北大西洋集团理事会会议上的讲话来说，就是“扩大共同分担的武器费用的范围……”。美国侵略者这样不顾后果地进行扩军备战，只会给财政上带来更大的困难，无异饮鸩止渴！
