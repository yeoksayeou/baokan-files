Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th - Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Heinrich Rau, said in Shanghai last night: "The Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government, under the guise of revising the US-Japan 'Security Treaty,' is preparing to sign a US-Japan military alliance treaty, the spearhead of which is directed at the security of the peoples of Asia and the Far East. The government of the German Democratic Republic strongly condemns this action by the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government that endangers peace in the Far East and fully supports the firm position taken by the People's Republic of China against the revival of Japanese militarism endangering peace in the Far East."

Deputy Prime Minister Heinrich Rau made these remarks at a welcoming banquet held by Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Mayor of Shanghai. The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, which he leads, is currently on a friendly visit to Shanghai.

In his speech, Deputy Prime Minister Heinrich Rau also praised the report on disarmament issues recently made by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Comrade Khrushchev, at the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He pointed out that this is a new testament to the Soviet Union's great peace policy, and this measure is a manifestation of the unparalleled strength of the socialist camp.

In his speech, Deputy Prime Minister Heinrich Rau also emphasized the urgency of stopping the revival of West German militarism and resolving the West Berlin issue. He said: The danger in Europe caused by West German militarism, and the danger in the Far East caused by Japanese militarism, are both supported by US imperialism, and we must not ignore the conspiracies of US imperialism.

Deputy Prime Minister Heinrich Rau said that the Chinese people and the Chinese government have consistently supported the German people's struggle against the revival of West German militarism. He expressed his gratitude for this.

Speaking of the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction, Deputy Prime Minister Heinrich Rau said: "Your speed of development and the great achievements you have made are impossible for any Western country to achieve."

At the beginning of the banquet, Mayor Ke Qingshi spoke, expressing a warm welcome to the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic. He said that the people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, are watching with incomparable excitement the socialist camp becoming more united and unprecedentedly strong, and are encouraged by the new victories and achievements made by the socialist brotherly countries.

Ke Qingshi expressed his heartfelt thanks to the government and people of the German Democratic Republic for their assistance to Shanghai's economic and cultural construction. He also praised the great efforts and contributions made by the German people in the struggle against the revival of West German militarism, for the unification of Germany, and for the defense of European and world peace, and expressed his deep belief that this struggle will surely achieve final victory.

Attending the banquet were responsible persons from Shanghai's party, government, and military organs, as well as well-known figures from all walks of life.
