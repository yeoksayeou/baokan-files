People's Communes are a Source of Happiness for All Ethnic Groups
Long Bengan, Deputy Secretary of the Sanjiang People's Commune Party Committee, Jinping County, Guizhou (Miao Nationality)

Amidst a chorus of Great Leap Forward achievements, all members of our Sanjiang People's Commune, together with the people of the whole country, victoriously passed through 1959, and with full confidence in the cause of socialist construction, stepped into the new year.

Our Sanjiang People's Commune, comprising over 20,000 people of the Dong, Miao, Han, and other ethnic groups, achieved unprecedented and brilliant successes in the past year under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the glorious illumination of the General Line. Compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958: Forestry, which is the main source of income for our commune, increased by 60%; animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries increased by 8% to 36% respectively; as for industrial production, which our previous generations had never even seen, it increased by a staggering 34.5 times. The total income of the commune reached 5.87 million yuan, averaging 269 yuan per person, an increase of nearly one and a half times compared to 1958. Public canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly have been established in every village, and the lives of the commune members are becoming more and more prosperous. Every festival, by the beautiful Clear Water Pond, Dong songs and Miao dances reverberate with joyful sounds. From practical life, the commune members increasingly deeply realize that the people's commune is the source of happiness for all ethnic groups.

Our commune is located in an area where 95% of the land is hillside, but it is no longer the barren mountains and bald ridges of the pre-liberation era, but an ocean of forests. The whole commune had already achieved greening in 1958. In 1959, relying on the superiority of the people's commune's "large scale and high degree of public ownership," we cultivated more than 60,000 mu of fast-growing, high-yield forests. From the spring of 1959 to now, the whole commune has nurtured 320,000 mu of young forests. In the vast forest sea of our commune, the accumulated volume of timber available for harvesting is at least 3 million cubic meters. However, during the agricultural cooperative period, due to the shortage of labor and insufficient funds, large-scale logging was subject to certain restrictions, and the unreasonable phenomenon of "old fir trees piled up in the deep mountains, and many young forests by the river" could not be solved for a long time. In 1959, the commune organized more than 2,400 people to go deep into the old forests to cut timber, and built 66 li of highways and trails in the forest area, blasted through 60 li of shaded river channels in the forest area, and erected 58 li of cableways and wooden rail flatcar tracks for transporting timber. Because of so much forest area construction, the old fir and pine timber in the remote mountains, which the agricultural cooperatives were unable to cut, can now be transported out continuously. The commune members happily sang: "The people's commune is really good, the ancient trees of thousands of years have been liberated, flatcars are used to transport wood, no matter how high the cliffs and mountains are!" In the past year, our commune harvested 24,000 cubic meters of timber, worth more than 400,000 yuan, an increase of 60% compared to 1958. Due to the extensive development of forest resources, the forestry chemical industry has also flourished. In 1959, the commune established 76 forestry chemical plants, producing 11 kinds of industrial products such as tannin extract, turpentine, and rosin, totaling more than 90 tons.

Our mountain is a mountain of treasures. When the autumn plowing and autumn planting in 1959 were basically completed, the commune organized a treasure-collecting army of more than 5,000 people, and in more than 30 days, collected a total of 52.4 million jin of various mountain products such as tung oil seeds, gallnuts, oak seeds, wild medicinal materials, and rosin, worth 2.62 million yuan. If we add the income from logging, the total forestry income of the commune is as high as more than 3 million yuan, equivalent to 1.5 times the grain income of the commune, accounting for 51.5% of the total income of the commune; calculated according to the total population of the commune, the average per person is 140 yuan. The commune members sang: "Sanjiang is a good place, with green mountains and clear waters and fragrant flowers, the large and small mountains are full of treasures, and the slopes are covered with fir trees like an ocean."

Our area, which has always been short of grain, also underwent a great change in 1959. Although 1959 suffered a particularly severe drought of more than 60 days, thanks to the construction and repair of a large number of water conservancy projects after the establishment of the commune, and the persistence of all commune members in fighting drought, we finally subdued the drought demon and achieved a good harvest without rain. In addition, with effective measures such as deep plowing, close planting, and increased fertilization, grain production achieved a bumper harvest, with the average yield per mu increasing from 625 jin in 1958 to 1,095 jin. In 1957, we still needed the state to supply more than 3.6 million jin of grain, but in 1959, we not only achieved self-sufficiency, but also sold more than 3.7 million jin of surplus grain to the state.

With the development of production, the appearance of the commune has also undergone tremendous changes. Among the 42 production teams in the commune, there were still 23 poor teams in 1958, and in one year of 1959, 18 poor teams caught up with or surpassed the rich teams. More than 85% of the households in the commune have savings, with savings amounting to more than 600,000 yuan, averaging 81 yuan per household.

The achievements we made in 1959 are tremendous. However, to completely change the face of the mountainous area, we still need to make more arduous efforts. In 1960, we strive to achieve a grain yield of 2,000 jin per mu, vigorously develop fast-growing, high-yield forests, and partially achieve timber maturity in six years; industrial, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production must also achieve a greater leap forward. There is every reason to believe that under the correct leadership of the Party and under the specific organization of the people's commune, our goals can certainly be achieved.

    人民公社是各族人民的幸福源泉
    贵州锦屏县三江公社党委副书记　龙本干　（苗族）
    在一片跃进声中，我们三江人民公社的全体社员和全国人民一道，胜利地度过了1959年，满怀着对社会主义建设事业的必胜信念，跨进了新的一年。
    我们三江人民公社的二万多侗、苗、汉等族人民，在过去的一年中，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，取得了史无前例的辉煌成就。和大跃进的1958年相比：作为我社收入主要来源的林业增长了六成；畜牧业、副业、渔业分别增长8％至36％；至于我们上一辈人根本没有看到过的工业生产，竟猛增三十四点五倍。全社总收入达五百八十七万元，每人平均二百六十九元，比1958年增加将近一倍半。村村寨寨办起了公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院，社员们的生活越过越美好了。每逢节日，在秀丽的清水池边，侗歌苗舞，欢声震野。从实际生活中，社员们日益深切地认识到，人民公社是各族人民幸福的源泉。
    我们公社所处的地方，95％是山坡，但是，现在这里已经不是解放前的荒山秃岭，而是一片森林的海洋。1958年全社就已实现了绿化。1959年，依靠人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，我们培育了六万多亩快速丰产林。从1959年春天到现在，全社已抚育幼林三十二万亩。在我们公社广阔的林海里，可供采伐的木材蓄积量，至少有三百万立方米。但在农业社时，由于劳力少，资金不足，大量采伐却受到一定的限制，“深山积压老杉木，河边多是幼年林”的不合理现象，长时期得不到解决。1959年，公社组织了两千四百多人深入深山老林采伐木材，并在林区修建了六十六华里公路和便道，炸通六十华里的林区阴滩河道，架设运送木材的厢道和木轨平车道五十八里。由于进行了这样多的林区建设，农业社时无力采伐的深山远山的老杉、松木材，也能够源源外运了。社员们高兴地唱起来：“人民公社实在好，千年古树翻身了，运木使用平车道，哪怕悬岩和山高！”一年来，我们公社采伐的木材达两万四千立方米，价值四十多万元，比1958年增长60％。由于森林资源的广泛开发，林业化学工业也蓬勃发展起来，1959年全社办起林业化工厂七十六个，生产了栲胶、松节油、松脂等工业品十一种，共九十多吨。
    我们的山是万宝山。在1959年秋耕秋种基本结束时，全社组织五千多人的采宝大军，在三十多天的时间里，共采集桐茶子、五棓子、青杠子、野生药材、松脂等各种山货五千二百四十万斤，价值二百六十二万元。如果加上采伐木材的收入，全社整个林业收入高达三百多万元，相当于全社粮食收入的一点五倍，占全社总收入的51．5％；按全社总人口算，每人平均合一百四十元。社员歌唱道：“三江是个好地方，山青水绿百花香，大山小岭全是宝，遍坡杉木似海洋。”
    我们这个一向缺粮的地区，1959年也大变样了。1959年虽然遭受了六十多天的特大旱灾，可是由于公社建立后新修和补修了大量的水利工程，和全体社员坚持抗旱，终于降服了旱魔，实现无雨保丰收。再加上深翻、密植和多施肥等有效措施，粮食生产获得特大丰收，平均亩产量由1958年的六百二十五斤增至一千零九十五斤。1957年我们还需要国家供应三百六十多万斤粮食，1959年不仅实现了自给，还向国家出售三百七十多万斤余粮。
    随着生产的发展，公社面貌也发生了巨大的变化。全社四十二个生产队，1958年还有二十三个穷队，1959年一年就有十八个穷队赶上或超过了富队。全社85％以上的户数有存款，储蓄金额达六十多万元，平均每户存八十一元。
    我们在1959年取得的成绩是巨大的。可是要彻底改变山区面貌，还需作更艰巨的努力。1960年，我们力争实现粮食亩产双千斤，大搞快速丰产林，部分做到六年成材；工业、牧、副、渔业生产也要实现更大跃进。完全有理由相信，在党的正确领导下，在人民公社的具体组织下，我们的目标一定能够达到。
