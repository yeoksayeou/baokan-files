Several Drugs for Fattening Pigs
China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Animal Husbandry

When pigs receive a balanced and reasonable feed at different stages of growth, the fattening time can be greatly shortened, and the feed used can be significantly reduced. If supplemented with some drugs that promote fattening, the effect will be even better. Here, we will introduce several drugs that have a growth-promoting effect on pigs:

Antibiotics

Chlortetracycline and oxytetracycline are antibacterial drugs. Adding a small amount to the feed can change the distribution of microorganisms in the pig's intestines, inhibit the reproduction of harmful microorganisms, promote the absorption of nutrients, and increase the pig's appetite. For every gram of antibiotic with a potency of 1,000 units, the daily dosage for pigs weighing less than 50 jin is about 15 to 30 grams per head, and for pigs weighing more than 50 jin, the dosage is 30 to 60 grams. Feeding antibiotics can increase the weight gain of pigs by more than 10% and save more than 50% of feed. The weight gain effect is more significant for piglets, especially weak piglets. In addition, antibiotics can reduce the incidence and mortality of piglet white diarrhea. When feeding antibiotics, it is best to sprinkle the antibiotics into the feed and mix well before feeding the pigs, because it is not heat-resistant and cannot be cooked with the feed.

Vitamin B12

Supplementing a small amount of vitamin B12 in the feed can improve the pig's utilization of plant-based feed, thereby increasing the pig's weight gain and feed utilization. It has a more significant effect on the weight gain of piglets. For pigs weighing less than 50 jin, supplementing about 20 micrograms per head per day in the feed (each microgram is one millionth of a gram), and for pigs weighing more than 50 jin, supplementing about 30 micrograms per head per day can increase weight gain by more than 10%. If used in combination with antibiotics, the weight gain effect will be even better.

Trace Elements

When green fodder is insufficient, piglets are prone to trace element deficiency. If each pig is supplemented with 50 to 100 mg of ferrous sulfate, 10 to 20 mg of copper sulfate, and 1 to 5 mg of potassium iodide per day, the growth and development effect is good. Adding a small amount of cobalt to the feed also has a good effect. Feeding 5 to 10 mg of cobalt chloride per head every other day can promote the activity of beneficial microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract and is beneficial to the formation of vitamin B12. Several trace elements should be fed at the same time. Pigs fed with trace elements gain weight about 14% faster.

Methylthiouracil

During the fattening stage of pigs, giving methylthiouracil can inhibit thyroid function, thereby reducing the basic metabolism of pigs, saving heat energy consumption, and further accelerating the fattening speed of pigs. In the final stage of fattening, using an implantation device to implant 100 to 150 mg under the ear root or ear skin of fattening pigs every 20 days can increase the weight gain rate of fattening pigs by 13%-17%, or feed methylthiouracil twice a day, 2 mg each time (to be mixed well with the feed) continuously for 40 days, which also has the effect of accelerating fattening.

Thiourea

Thiourea is also a drug that inhibits thyroid function. Fattening pigs weighing more than 150 jin are fed 5 mg five times a day for 40 consecutive days, and then stopped for 10 days, which can make the pigs gain weight 17% faster.

Tissue Fluid Injection

Use equal amounts of fresh bovine liver and spleen, wash with tap water, place at a temperature of 2 to 4 degrees Celsius for seven days and nights, take out and chop with a knife, grind into a mud in a mortar, add three times the amount of 0.9% saline to dilute, soak for sterilization and filter. Injecting 10 ml into the arm muscle of each pig every ten days can promote the metabolic function of animals, enhance gastrointestinal digestion ability, and increase the weight gain speed of pigs by about 10%.

    几种育肥猪的药物
    中国农业科学院畜牧研究所
    猪在不同的生长阶段得到平衡合理的饲料，育肥时间可以大大缩短，使用的饲料也显著降低；如果再辅以一些具有催肥作用的药物，效果就会更好。这里我们仅就几种对猪生长有促进作用的药物介绍如下：
    抗菌素
    金霉素和土霉素是抗菌药品，在饲料中拌入少量，能改变猪肠内微生物的分布，抑制有害微生物的繁殖，促进营养物质的吸收，增加猪的食欲。每克含量为一千单位的抗菌素，活重五十斤以下的猪，每头每日用量约为十五至三十克，五十斤以上的猪，用三十至六十克。喂抗菌素，猪增重可以提高10％以上，并能节省50％以上的饲料，对仔猪特别是瘦弱的仔猪，增重效果更为显著。此外，抗菌素能减低仔猪白痢病及死亡率。喂抗菌素时最好在临喂猪以前，把抗菌素撒入饲料中，搅拌均匀，因为它不耐热，不能和饲料一同煮。
    维生素B12
    在饲料里补充微量的维生素B12，能够改善猪对植物性饲料的利用，因而可以提高猪的增重和饲料的利用。对幼猪的增重更有显著效果：活重五十斤以下的猪，在饲料中每头每日约补充二十微克（每微克为百万分之一克），活重五十斤以上的猪，每头每日约补充三十微克，即能提高增重10％以上，如果与抗菌素同时并用，增重效果更好。
    微量元素
    在青饲料不足时，幼猪容易患微量元素缺乏症，若每头每天补喂硫酸铁五十至一百毫克，硫酸铜十至二十毫克，碘化钾一至五毫克，对生长发育效果良好，在饲料中添加少量的钴也有良好效果，每头每隔一天喂氯化钴五至十毫克，可以促进胃肠内有益的微生物活动，并有利于维生素B12的形成。几种微量元素应该同时喂给，喂微量元素的猪增重约快14％。
    甲基硫氧嘧啶
    在猪的催肥阶段，给予甲基硫氧嘧啶，可以抑制甲状腺机能，从而降低猪的基本代谢，节约热能的消耗，进一步加快猪的肥育速度，在肥育最后阶段，用埋植器在肥猪耳根或耳部皮下，每二十天埋植一百至一百五十毫克，可使肥猪增重速度提高13％—17％，或者每日喂甲基硫氧嘧啶两次，每次两毫克（要和饲料拌匀）连续四十天，也有加快育肥的效果。
    硫脲
    硫脲也是抑制甲状腺机能的一种药物，一百五十斤以上的肥猪，每日喂五次，每次五毫克，连续喂四十天，停喂十天，可以使猪增重快17％。
    组织液注射
    用新鲜牛肝脏脾脏各半量，用自来水洗净，在摄氏二度到四度温度下放置七昼夜，取出用小刀切碎，在乳钵中研成泥状，加三倍0．9％食盐水稀释浸泡灭菌过滤。每猪每十天在臂部肌肉注射十毫升，可以促进动物的代谢机能，增强胃肠消化能力，使猪的增重速度提高约10％。
