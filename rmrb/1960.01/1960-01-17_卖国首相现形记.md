A Record of the Betraying-the-Country Prime Minister's True Colors

　　Chi Bei'ou

　　The angry masses are great and many. Shinsuke Kishi was so scared that he was trembling all over. He had to go to Washington to sign and seal the documents, fearing that he wouldn't even be able to leave the gate of his official residence. Thousands of policemen surrounded the airport, and armored vehicles were densely lined up on both sides of the highway. The dignified prime minister was like a petty thief, sneaking away before dawn. The Japanese people cursed him for losing all face, while the American masters praised him as a "good boy." (Note)

　　Note: "Good Boy" is a term of praise for children, meaning "good child," and can also be interpreted as "good lackey."

    卖国首相现形记
    池北偶愤怒的群众大大的有，岸信介吓得全身发抖，要去华盛顿签字画押，就怕出不了公馆门口。几千名警察包围机场，装甲车密排公路左右，堂堂首相像一个小偷，趁天还未亮赶快溜走。日本人骂他丢尽了脸，美国老爷赞他“好仆欧。”（注）
    注：英语“Good　Boy”是夸奖孩子的话，意思是“好孩子”，也可作“好小厮”解。
