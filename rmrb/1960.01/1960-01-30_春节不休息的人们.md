During the Spring Festival, when the people of the whole country are joyfully celebrating, a small number of employees in some continuous production sectors are still sticking to their posts. We would like to extend our sincere greetings to them.

Steel Capital Heroes Report Good News During the Festival

The Spring Festival in Anshan, the steel capital, is filled with a joyous and fighting atmosphere. The streets and various entertainment venues are crowded with workers on vacation, while in the vast factory area, thousands of chimneys billow with thick smoke, and the surging molten iron and dancing steel flowers compete for beauty.

On New Year's Eve, in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, the workers of the previous shift had not yet left work when the workers of the next shift, carrying letters of determination and large-character posters congratulating the festival, came to the fiery scene with gongs and drums, and fought together with the workers of the previous shift. At this time, the bell for tapping steel from No. 1 open-hearth furnace rang. Furnace foreman Han Weiyu commanded the operation in front of and behind the furnace, appearing happy and tense. Before starting work, he and the workers had resolved to produce a heat of fast steel during the festival. They indeed realized their wish. It only took a little over eight hours from repairing the furnace to tapping the steel. The workers of the whole plant used the achievement of increasing steel production by 327 tons to send off New Year's Eve, and then spent the dawn of the first day of the Spring Festival with even more outstanding labor. The workers of No. 4 open-hearth furnace, under the command of duty foreman Wang Enxin, braved the stinging high temperature to operate intensely. They used fast steelmaking methods such as high-temperature rapid furnace repair and layered burning through the charge. As a result, it took only seven hours and fifty-five minutes to produce a heat of steel, which was more than two hours shorter than planned. On the first day of the Spring Festival, the whole plant again overfulfilled the production plan, realizing the guarantee of a good start to the Spring Festival.

The people of the steel capital used such selfless labor to celebrate the first Spring Festival of the 1960s. From the fire-flashing open-hearth furnaces and blast furnaces to the cold wind-swept mines and transportation lines, from the steaming canteens to the steel-flower-shining rolling mills, they did everything possible to increase steel production for the country. In the No. 1 Primary Rolling Mill, the famous fast rolling expert Zhao Zhen'en and charging machine operator Wan Jiacai competed against each other on New Year's Eve. Zhao Zhen'en used his experience of rolling double ingots. He skillfully pressed the button, and the thick steel ingots turned into slender steel billets in the blink of an eye. Wan Jiacai, who was driving the crane in the high sky, skillfully drove the crane and adopted the advanced method of rapid ingot delivery, constantly sending the steel ingots just out of the heating furnace to the rolling mill. As a result of the competition between the two experts, the last shift on New Year's Eve created an hourly rolling record that exceeded the national plan by 20%. Following the victory on New Year's Eve, nearly 400 technical innovations appeared in the whole plant on the first day of the Spring Festival, which powerfully guaranteed high production.

Leading cadres in the steel capital also gave up their holiday rest and came to the production site to fight alongside the workers for increased steel production. In the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant, Yang Chunpu, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, and Yang Shijie, First Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee, and other leading comrades, wrapped a large number of dumplings with the canteen staff on New Year's Eve for the workers who persisted in production. On the morning of the Spring Festival, they went to the open-hearth furnace to comfort the workers and encourage them to increase production. On the first day of the Spring Festival, the leading cadres of the Dong Anshan Iron Mine went deep into the site to solve problems in production together with the workers. Zhang Junde, director of the sintering workshop of this mine, succeeded in a technical innovation in labor with the workers, breaking through the key to blocking leaks in frozen materials, and achieving high production on the same day.

In the past two days, new production reports have been continuously coming from various factories and mines in the steel capital, adding more joy to the Spring Festival and bringing greater revolutionary enthusiasm to the people who persist in production. The heroes of the steel capital are determined to realize the Party's call to them of "Red throughout January, a completely red Spring Festival, and a red start to February" with their outstanding labor.

Spending the Spring Festival on the Reservoir Construction Site

The Spring Festival comes once a year, but this year's Spring Festival has many differences from the past: there is both a pleasant rest and a joyous battle. This is a very deep impression that the reporter got at the Wohushan Reservoir construction site in Licheng County.

On the first day of the lunar year, the sky was clear and the sun shone on the earth. The colorful flags on the Leap Forward Gate and the couplets or slogans such as "Establish Lofty Aspirations" and "Slay the Flood Dragon Before the Flood Season" posted at the entrances of the work sheds were particularly conspicuous and dazzling. After the migrant workers had their festive meal of dumplings, they gathered excitedly in a pre-arranged open-air theater, congratulating each other on the victory of winter construction and encouraging each other to create greater achievements in the spring. As soon as the applause stopped, the music rose into the air, and programs such as "Ode to the Spring Festival" and "New Year's Greetings," which were compiled and performed by the migrant workers themselves, began. Several theaters were performing at the same time, which was very lively and full of a festive atmosphere.

The afternoon sun was slightly westward—the migrant workers had just finished lunch, and hundreds of well-dressed young men with tools in their hands gathered at the Zhonggong Regiment Headquarters of the Wohushan Reservoir. They said: Their hands were itching from being idle, and they wanted to go to the construction site to work for a while. Xu Xingbang, political commissar of the construction site, looked at the pleading and excited faces and had no idea what to do, so he walked with everyone while saying, "The day for the big battle is the third day of the lunar year!"

Wohushan Reservoir has adhered to winter construction by using the method of sunny soil ponds, centralized soil collection, and timed soil preparation, and centralized rolling and compaction, becoming one of the provincial model units for winter construction. In order to ensure that the reservoir is completed before the flood season and to retain floodwater, it is planned to further develop a high-efficiency movement to realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of climbing and transporting soil and long-distance soil transportation, and to have a good start on the third day of the lunar year. In this way, during the Spring Festival, it is necessary to repair old tools, manufacture some new tools, and prepare the necessary materials. If there is a holiday, where will the people come from? Volunteer participation. Those who ask to go to the construction site to work are a group of volunteers.

The Wohushan Reservoir construction site on the afternoon of the first day of the lunar year was even more lively. In addition to the sound of literary and artistic programs from the loudspeakers, there was also the squeaking sound of soil transport vehicles, the clanging sound of drilling stone holes, and the rumbling sound of testing machines, which plunged the festive construction site into a state of battle. It was still a howling cold wind that day, and if there was nothing to do, people couldn't even take their hands out, but those warm-hearted young men were waving their iron hammers, pushing and transporting soil and rocks, their mouths and noses exhaling hot air, and beads of sweat dripped from their foreheads onto the ground and their hands. At this time, the coats and cotton clothes that were worn to the construction site became cold storage. Erxianlian Xu Quanjian, this young man who works fiercely, took a ten-foot-long iron rod, climbed to the hillside, inserted it into the crack of the stone, leaned on the iron rod with his shoulder, and leaned forward, groaning and groaning, and a large stone weighing six or seven hundred catties was lifted down by him. The commune members told me: "Our platoon leader is always afraid that there will be danger in working after the blasting, so he first comes to move these dangerous stones; since we came to the construction site, we have been drilling holes and blasting every day, and dealing with stones, but there has never been a mistake, thanks to his careful management. A few days ago, he was rated as a special-class model among the whole people's workers, and our platoon is also a model platoon." "Platoon leader Meng, would you like a drink of water?" The migrant workers shouted loudly, but he didn't seem to hear it, and didn't even lift his head, continuing to work with a ten-jin iron hammer, only to see a large area of stone blocks appearing behind him.

"Platoon leader Meng, take a break." He heard my voice, slowly turned around, reluctantly put down the iron hammer, and said: "Comrade, we have suffered too much from floods in the past, and it is better to build the reservoir sooner than ten good years! We are going to have a good start the day after tomorrow (the third day of the lunar year), and the dam will not have enough stone materials!" Then he drew on his notebook with a pen and announced to everyone: "400 cubic feet of stone will be quarried and smashed in two hours, which is considered a small opening of the first day of the lunar year, let's go back to eat." More than 300 commune members seemed not to have heard his words and were unwilling to put down the tools in their hands.

As night fell, the sound of gongs and drums shook the mountains and echoed in all directions, breaking the silence of the evening; the migrant workers gathered towards the theater.

Pioneers Who Persist in Their Posts

On New Year's Eve, while people were eating dumplings at home and beginning to celebrate the Spring Festival, a new battle of "double harvests in passenger and freight transport" was underway for railway workers. At the Guang'anmen Station in Beijing, the pioneer of the Great Leap Forward, more than 800 railway workers in charge of transportation were transporting large quantities of construction materials with joy.

With the loud roar of the whistle, a long train drove into the station. The station was full of busy people, drivers were shuttling back and forth to transfer vehicles, and switchmen were busy leading sections of freight cars to pre-arranged cargo berths. The loading and unloading workers took off their cotton coats and jumped onto the train to unload steel plates, wood, machinery, cement, and other materials transported from all over the motherland. They also loaded machine tools, iron pipes, and various daily-use industrial products onto the train and transported them to Hankou, Wuxi, the Northeast, and other parts of the country.

The workers of Guang'anmen Station knew that the passenger volume would surge during the Spring Festival, and the freight department would have to greatly shorten the train's stop time to speed up vehicle turnover. All employees were mobilized, and the secretary of the Party General Branch and the stationmasters stayed in their positions and personally directed the battle. The more than 100 loading and unloading workers of Class C were originally scheduled to go to work at 6:00 p.m., but they came to their posts at 4:00 p.m. and launched a technical performance competition for unloading cement with the workers of Class B who were busy.

"Those who carry on the car must be fast, and those who carry under the car must be fast!" Yao Chuanhua, the leader of Group 5 of Class C, said, while putting a piece of cloth on his shoulder, Zhang Yongli on the car immediately put a fifty-kilogram bag of cement on his shoulder, and he and everyone else shuttled back and forth, unloading the cement quickly. In the past, it took a group more than a minute to unload a ton of cement, but tonight, their entire group unloaded 45 tons in 24 minutes, winning the championship in the competition. The workers of Group 2 of Class B also won the second place with a score of 29 minutes to unload 45 tons.

For a whole night, the workers became more and more courageous. Until the morning of the first day of the lunar year, when the workers of Class A took over, the workers of Class C were still unwilling to leave work, and launched a fast loading and unloading competition with the workers of Class A. The workers of Class A had already made all preparations for a good start in advance, and as soon as they started work, they put forward the slogan "Overcome the severe cold, chase after me, speed up, and ensure safety." Many groups completed the work that used to take more than 40 minutes in more than 20 minutes.

During the festival, the canteen staff wrapped a large number of dumplings and also brought the dumplings to the operation room and the switch room, so that every employee who persisted in their posts could eat them.

The workers regarded the first day of the Spring Festival as the beginning of a new production battle. Within 24 hours from 6:00 p.m. on New Year's Eve to 6:00 p.m. on the first day of the lunar year, the entire station received and dispatched a total of 64 trains, loading and unloading more than 5,000 tons of various materials, which was more than 1,000 tons more than the day before the festival. Due to the accelerated loading and unloading speed, the average working stop time of each freight car at the station was also shortened by 24 minutes compared with the day before the festival, and safe production was achieved.

    春节不休息的人们
    当着全国人民欢乐地度过春节的时候。在一些连续生产的部门，有少数职工，在这几天仍然坚持在生产岗位上，我们谨向他们致以亲切的慰问。
    钢都英雄佳节传捷报
    钢都鞍山的春节洋溢着欢乐和战斗的气氛。街头和各个娱乐场所挤满了休假的工人，而在庞大的工厂区里，千百个烟囱浓烟滚滚，奔腾的铁水和飞舞的钢花相嫓美。
    除夕夜里，第一炼钢厂里，上一班的工人还没下班，下一班的工人就抬着决心书和祝贺节日的大字报，敲锣打鼓来到了炉火熊熊的现场，同上一班的工人一起战斗。这时一号平炉出钢的钟声敲响了，炉长韩维玉炉前炉后指挥操作，显得愉快而又紧张。上班前他和工人们就决心要在节日里炼出一炉快速钢。他们果然实现了自己的愿望，这炉钢从补炉到出钢只用了八个小时多一点。全厂的工人们用增产钢三百二十七吨的成就送走了除夕，接着就以更加出色的劳动度过了春节第一天的黎明。四号平炉的工人们在值班工长王恩信的指挥下，冒着刺脸的高温紧张操作。他们运用了高温快速补炉、分层烧透加料等快速炼钢方法，结果用了七小时五十五分钟就炼出了一炉钢，比计划缩短了两个多小时。春节第一天全厂又超额完成生产计划，实现了春节开门红的保证。
    钢都的人们就是用这样忘我的劳动，来欢度六十年代的第一个春节。从火光闪闪的平炉、高炉旁，到寒风飒飒矿山和运输线上，从热气腾腾的食堂到钢花闪射的轧钢机旁，千方百计的为国家增产钢铁。在第一初轧厂，著名的快速轧钢能手赵震恩和装入机手万家才，在除夕夜里互相比赛。赵震恩运用轧双锭的经验，只见他熟练的按着电钮，一根根粗大的钢锭转眼之间就变成了细长钢坯，而在高空中驾驶吊车的万家才，灵巧的驾驶着吊着采用快速送锭的先进方法，不断地把刚从加热炉里出来的钢锭送到轧钢机前。两个能手大比武的结果，除夕最后这个班创造了超达国家计划20％的小时轧钢纪录。紧接着除夕的胜利，春节这天全厂出现了将近四百件技术革新，有力地保证了高产。
    钢都的领导干部也放弃了节日的休息，来到生产现场同工人们一起为增产钢铁奋战。在第二炼钢厂，中共辽宁省委书记处书记杨春甫和中共鞍山市委第一书记杨士杰等领导同志，在除夕夜里和食堂人员一起给坚持生产的工人包了大量的饺子，春节早晨又到平炉上慰问工人们，鼓励工人增加生产。东鞍山铁矿的领导干部，春节这天都深入现场同工人一起解决生产中的问题，这个矿烧结车间主任张钧德在劳动中同工人们研究试验成功了一项技术革新，突破了冻料块堵漏子的关键，当天就实现了高产。
    这两天从钢都各厂矿不断传出来新的生产捷报，给春节增加了更大的欢乐。也给坚持生产的人们带来了更大的革命干劲。钢都的英雄们坚决以自己的出色的劳动，实现党向他们提出的“一月红到底、春节满堂红、二月开门红”的号召。
    水库工地度春节
    春节，一年一度，可是今年的春节却有许多与已往不同之处：既有愉快的休息，又有欢乐的战斗。这是记者在历城县卧虎山水库工地得到的一个很深刻的印象。
    初一，碧空万里，阳光普照大地。跃进门上的各色彩旗，工棚门口贴的立下凌云志，汛前斩蛟龙等对联或标语，被映得分外醒目耀眼。民工们用过节日的盛餐水饺之后，兴奋的聚集在预先布置好的一处露天剧场，互相祝贺冬季施工的胜利，勉励春季再创伟绩。掌声刚息，乐声扬空，民工们自己编排的“春节颂”“拜年”等节目开演了。几处戏场同时演出，非常热闹，一片节日气氛。
    午阳略偏——民工们刚吃过午饭，卧虎山水库仲宫团部，聚集着几百名穿戴整齐、手握工具的小伙子。他们说：闲的手都发痒了，到工地干一忽儿磨磨兴。工地许兴榜政委，看着那恳求而又兴奋的面孔，也没有了主意，随着大家边走边说：“咱们初三才是大战的日子！”
    卧虎山水库用土塘向阳，集中上土；定时备土，集中碾压的办法，坚持了严冬施工，成为全省冬季施工模范单位之一。为了保证水库汛前建成，拦蓄洪水，计划进一步开展高工效运动，将爬坡运土、远距运土实现机械化和半机械化，到初三先来个开门红。这样，在春节期间，就需要做好旧工具的修理，部分新工具的制造，以及必要的备料。要放假，人从那里来？志愿参加。要求到工地干活的，就是志愿者中的一批。
    初一下午的卧虎山水库工地，更热闹了，除了扩音器传出的文艺节目的声音之外，又增加了运土车的吱吱声；打石眼的叮当声，以及试机器的隆隆声，把个节日的工地卷入战斗的境地。这天依然寒风呼啸，要是没有事手都拿不出来，可是那些心热的小伙子，挥舞着铁锤，推运着土石，口鼻热气迸发，汗珠顺前额滴落在地上，手上；这时，上工地穿来的外套、棉衣，都成了冷备货。二仙连徐健全这个干活勇猛的小伙子，拿着一根丈许的铁钎，爬到半山坡，插在石缝里，肩顶铁钎，身体前俯，唉呀唉呀地干起来，六、七百斤重的一块大石头被他整个的掀下来。社员们告诉我说：“俺这个排长，总是怕放炮后干活出危险，先来搬掉这些险石；我们来工地后每天都是打眼放炮，和石头打交道，可从未出过差错，多亏他料理的周到，前些日子他被评为全民工中的特等模范，俺这个排也是个模范排”。“孟连长喝水不？”民工们大声喊，可是他似乎没有听到，连头也没有抬，继续挥着十多斤重的铁锤劳动着，只见在他的身后出现大片石块。
    “孟连长歇一忽儿吧”他听到我的声音，慢慢转过身，难舍的放下铁锤，说：“同志，过去我们受洪水之害太大了，水库能早会儿建成，要胜过十个好年！后天（初三）要搞开门红，大坝没有足够的石料不行啊！”然后他用笔在本子上划了划，向大家宣布：两个小时起石砸石四百方，算搞了初一小开门红，大家回去吃饭吧。三百多名社员好像没有听到他的话似的，不愿放下手中的工具。
    夜幕降临，锣鼓声震山四响，冲破晚间的寂静；民工们向剧场集来。
    坚持在岗位上的先行官
    除夕，当人们在家里吃着饺子，开始欢度春节的时候，铁路职工们“客运货运双丰收”的新战役正在进行着。在大跃进的先行——北京广安门车站，负责运输的八百多名铁路职工，正欢天喜地地运输着大批的建设物资。
    随着汽笛雄浑的吼声，一列长长的火车驶进车站。站上到处是繁忙的人们，司机往来调运着车辆，调车员忙着把一节节货车领到事先安排好的货位。装卸工人们，摔掉棉衣，跳上火车，把祖国各地运来的钢板、木材、机器、水泥等物资卸下车来。又把机床、铁管、各种日用工业品装上火车，运往汉口、无锡、东北等全国各地。
    广安门车站职工们知道，春节期间客运量激增，货运部门更要大力缩短列车停站时间，来加速车辆周转。全体职工都动员起来，党总支书记和站长们帅不离位，亲自跟班指挥战斗。丙班一百多名装卸工人本来是晚上六点钟上班，可是他们四点钟就来到了岗位，和正在忙碌的乙班工人们，展开了卸水泥的技术表演赛。
    “车上搬的要手快，车下扛的要腿快！”丙班五组的组长姚传华一边说，一边把一块布片披在肩上，车上的张永利立刻把五十公斤重的水泥袋放在他的肩上，他和大家一起，穿梭般地往来奔跑着，把水泥飞快地卸下车来。往常，一个组卸一吨水泥要一分多钟，可是今晚他们全组二十四分钟就卸完了四十五吨，夺得了竞赛的冠军。乙班二组工人们也以二十九分钟卸四十五吨的成绩获得了亚军。
    整整一个通宵，工人们越干越勇，直到初一早上，甲班工人接班的时候，丙班工人还不愿下班，又和甲班工人们开展了快装快卸的竞赛。甲班工人早已提前做好了开门红的一切准备，一上班就提出“战胜严寒，你追我赶，加快速度，保证安全”的口号，许多小组二十多分钟就干完了往常四十多分钟才能干完的活。
    节日里，食堂工作人员包了大量饺子，还把饺子端到运转室和搬道房，让每一个坚持岗位的职工都能吃上。
    职工们把春节头一天作为一个新的生产战役的开始，从除夕晚上六点钟到初一晚上六点的二十四小时之内，全站共接发六十四趟列车，装卸各种物资五千多吨，比节前一天多装卸一千多吨。由于装卸速度加快，每辆货车平均在站作业停留时间也比节前缩短了二十四分钟，并作到安全生产。　（新华社）
