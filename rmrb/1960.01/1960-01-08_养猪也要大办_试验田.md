To run "experimental fields" is a Marxist-Leninist working method of "combining leadership with the masses" and a good experience for leading continuous leaps forward in production. In recent years, our Ruian County Party Committee has accumulated some experience in leading livestock production and mastered some knowledge of pig raising. However, under the requirement of high-speed development of livestock production, we feel that our experience is far from enough. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for leading cadres to personally engage in livestock production "experimental fields," participate in production, and lead production. The comrades of our County Party Committee have made divisions of labor and gone to Longshan, Hengshan, Industrial and Communications, and Finance and Trade livestock farms to work with the breeders, summarizing the experience of high-speed development of livestock production from practice. At the same time, under the leadership of leading cadres personally engaging in experimental pig raising, a mass movement of large-scale livestock experimental fields has been launched throughout the county, with more than 3,000 cadres engaging in livestock experimental farms, experimental pigs, and experimental cattle.

Practice has proved that the process of developing livestock production is a process of struggle between two roads and two lines. The view of belittling pig raising was deeply rooted in the old society. After liberation, especially since the second half of 1959, due to vigorous publicity of the great significance of developing livestock production, the erroneous view of belittling pig raising has been criticized and corrected, and many people love the pig raising business. However, the influence of this old idea is not easily eliminated. Some cadres and breeders still think: "There is no future in raising pigs, it's dirty and smelly." When Qian Xiuying, a model breeder at the Longshan Livestock Farm of Chengguan Commune, first entered the farm, some people sarcastically said, "It's too unpromising for such a young and beautiful girl to raise pigs!" Whenever she met an acquaintance, she blushed and didn't dare to face people, and she repeatedly suggested not doing pig raising work. However, when the leading cadres personally went deep into the livestock farm, participated in pig raising, and led pig raising, it gave the breeders great encouragement. Qian Xiuying, who was originally uneasy about raising pigs, realized the glory of the pig raising business and expressed her willingness to dedicate herself to the pig raising business and do a good job in pig raising. Because of her ideological transformation and her active study of pig raising techniques, she has now become a red banner among the breeders in the county. It can be seen from this that the leading cadres running pig raising "experimental fields" plays a significant role in changing customs and habits, reversing the erroneous view of belittling pig raising, and enabling the broad masses to establish a sense of honor in pig raising.

In an unprecedented high-speed development of the pig raising business, a series of new problems will inevitably arise. Therefore, leading cadres must integrate with the masses, participate in pig raising, and lead pig raising, in order to summarize and promote advanced experience in a timely manner, discover problems, and solve problems. Ji Diankai, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, Liu Weizong, the secretary of the Secretariat, and Chen Chongying, the secretary of the Chengguan Commune Party Committee, summarized the experience of livestock farms relying on the masses and building farms diligently and frugally while working with commune members in Longshan and Hengshan Livestock Farms. Sun Baojing, the secretary of the Secretariat of the County Party Committee, and Zheng Shengqiang, the secretary of the Mayu Commune Party Committee, further summarized the ten major experiences of comprehensive utilization of draught cattle through livestock experimental fields. Wu Xianlin, the secretary of the Dayue Commune Party Committee, jointly raised three experimental pigs with the livestock farm and the breeders. One pork pig weighed more than 700 jin, and the two sows achieved high yields after using double mating. Chen Demei, the secretary of the Party General Branch of the Shuangyang Management Area of Dayue Commune, and the breeders of the Yugen Production Team Livestock Farm jointly researched and promoted the advanced management experience of "three farms and five stations" (sow farm, pork pig farm, piglet farm, and sow breeding station, sick pig clinic, weak pig breeding station, piglet breeding station, boar and sow mating station). At present, 58 livestock farms in Dayue Commune have promoted their experience and established "three farms and five stations."

In the great development of pig raising, the four problems that our county urgently needs to solve are the source of pigs, feed, pig pens, and feeding management. Through cadres at all levels engaging in pig raising "experimental fields," working with the breeders, discussing together, and relying on the masses to offer suggestions and ideas, we have found solutions to the problems. For the problem of pig pens, in order to solve the difficulties of funds, wood, and tiles, we seized the experience pioneered by the Jianguo Production Team of Pingyangkeng Commune that raising pigs in mountain caves is low in cost, grows fast, accumulates fertilizer well, and is hygienic, and organized more than 9,000 representatives to visit the site successively, setting off a mass upsurge of large-scale pig raising in mountain caves. In the past two months, more than 15,000 mountain cave pig pens have been built throughout the county, and each commune has established a "thousand-pig cave" livestock base. For the problem of pig source, we summarized and promoted the experience of Longshan Livestock Farm in keeping all the females, double mating, repeated mating, eliminating empty pregnancies, and improving the survival rate of piglets. There are more than 40,000 sows in the county, and all 12,000 old sows are pregnant. For the problem of feed, according to the natural conditions of our county, we seized water lilies, fragrant vines, banana and taro leaves, sugar cane residue, and other wild grasses that can be used as pig feed, and launched a mass movement of silage feed. According to statistics, the county has prepared more than 2,000 jin of winter feed for each pig. For the problem of feeding management in pig farms, we summarized the feeding management experience of "three guarantees and five fixings, five comparisons" of Longshan Livestock Farm, and established model breeders Zheng Xiuying and Qian Xiuying who love the farm as their home, love the pigs as their treasures, have red thoughts, are versatile, and have a piglet survival rate of 98.2%. We have launched a competition movement to learn from Shuangshan (Longshan, Hengshan) and Shuangying (Zheng Xiuying, Qian Xiuying), and surpass Shuangshan and Shuangying throughout the county. Now, more than 2,000 livestock farms in the county have promoted their experience, and more than 1,300 breeders have caught up with and surpassed the technical level of Shuangying.

Through engaging in pig raising "experimental fields," 3,000 cadres in the county have mastered the laws of pig raising and learned the basic knowledge of pig raising, more than 1,100 cadres have learned feeding management, and more than 370 cadres have become versatile in feeding management, semen collection and breeding, piglet delivery, and epidemic prevention and vaccination. Because we have strengthened the leadership of the Party, removed ideological obstacles, promoted advanced experience in a timely manner, and solved problems through engaging in pig raising "experimental fields," we have greatly promoted the high-speed development of pig raising production. By the end of 1959, the county had established a total of 3,093 livestock farms, an increase of 172% compared with the end of April; there were a total of more than 169,000 pigs, an increase of 60.8% compared with April.

More pigs, more fertilizer, more grain, the total grain output of the county in 1959 increased by 35% compared with 1958.

    养猪也要大办“试验田”
    中共瑞安县委书记　杨秀峰
    搞“试验田”是“领导与群众相结合”的马克思列宁主义工作方法，是领导生产持续跃进的一条良好经验。几年来，我们瑞安县委对领导畜牧业生产已积累了一些经验，掌握了一些养猪的生产知识。但是，在高速度发展畜牧业生产的要求下，我们感到经验很不够。因此，领导干部亲自搞畜牧业生产“试验田”，参加生产，领导生产，是完全必要的。我们县委的同志，进行了分工，分别到隆山、横山、工交、财贸几个畜牧场，亲自与饲养员一起劳动，从实际中总结了高速度发展畜牧业生产的经验；同时，在领导干部亲自搞试验猪的带动下，全县掀起了一个大搞畜牧试验田运动，有三千多名干部搞了畜牧试验场、试验猪、试验牛。
    实践证明，发展畜牧业生产的过程，是一个两条道路和两条路线斗争过程。轻视养猪的观点，在旧社会是根深蒂固的。解放后，特别是1959年下半年来，由于大张旗鼓宣传了发展畜牧业生产的重大意义，轻视养猪的错误观点受到了批判和纠正，有许多人热爱养猪事业。但是，这种旧思想的影响，并不是很容易肃清的。在干部、饲养员中也还有人认为：“养猪没有出息，又脏、又臭。”城关公社隆山畜牧场模范饲养员钱秀英开始进场时，就有人冷言冷语讲：“这么年青漂亮的姑娘搞养猪，太没出息了！”她一碰到熟人，就面红耳赤，不敢见人面，曾经多次提出不干养猪工作。但是，当领导干部亲自深入畜牧场，参加养猪，领导养猪之后，给了饲养员莫大的鼓舞。原来对养猪不安心的钱秀英，认识到养猪事业的光荣，表示要献身养猪事业，干好养猪工作。由于她思想转变，积极钻研养猪技术，现在已成为全县饲养员中的一面红旗。由此可见，领导干部办养猪“试验田”，对于移风易俗，扭转轻视养猪的错误观点，使广大群众树立养猪光荣感，起着重大的作用。
    在一个空前高速度发展养猪事业中，必然会带来一系列的新问题。因此，领导干部与群众打成一片，参加养猪，领导养猪，才能及时总结和推广先进经验，发现问题，解决问题。县委第一书记季殿凯、书记处书记刘维宗与城关公社党委书记陈崇瀛等同志，在隆山、横山畜牧场和社员同劳动中，总结了畜牧场依靠群众、勤俭建场的经验。县委书记处书记孙宝经与马屿公社党委书记郑圣强同志，通过搞畜牧试验田，进一步总结了耕牛综合利用的十大经验。大岳公社党委书记吴宪林在畜牧场和饲养员合养了三头试验猪，一头肉猪体重七百多斤，两头母猪采用双重交配后获得了高产。大岳公社双垟管理区党总支书记陈得美与屿根生产队畜牧场饲养员一起研究和推行了“三场五所”（母猪场、肉猪场、仔猪场和母猪饲养所、病猪诊疗所、瘦弱猪饲养所、小猪饲养所、公母猪配种所）的先进管理经验。目前大岳公社已有五十八个畜牧场推广他们的经验，建立了“三场五所”。
    在养猪大发展中，我们全县急待解决的是猪源、饲料、猪舍、饲养管理等四个问题。通过各级干部搞养猪“试验田”，与饲养员同劳动、共同商量，依靠群众献计献策，从而找到了解决问题的办法。对猪舍问题，为了解决资金、木材、瓦片等困难，我们就抓住平阳坑公社建国生产队首创山洞养猪成本低、长膘快、积肥好、又卫生的经验，先后组织九千多代表到现场参观，掀起了群众性的大搞山洞养猪高潮。全县二个多月来已建山洞猪舍一万五千多个，每个公社都建立了“千猪洞”的畜牧基地。对猪源问题，我们总结推广了隆山畜牧场的见雌就留、双重配种、重复配种、消灭空怀、提高仔猪成活率的经验。全县已养母猪四万多头，一万二千多头老母猪全部满怀。对饲料问题，根据我县的自然条件，我们抓住了水荷花、芳茹藤、蕉藕叶、糖蔗渣及其他能供猪食的野草等，发动群众大搞青贮饲料运动。据统计，全县已为每头猪备足二千多斤越冬饲料。对猪场的饲养管理问题，我们总结了隆山畜牧场的“三包五定、五比”的饲养管理经验，树立了模范饲养员郑秀英、钱秀英爱场如家、爱猪如宝、思想红、多面手、小猪成活率占98．2％的先进标兵。在全县范围内开展了学双山（隆山、横山）学双英（郑秀英、钱秀英）、超双山超双英的竞赛运动。现在，全县已有二千多个畜牧场推广了他们的经验，有一千三百多个饲养员赶上和超过双英的技术水平。
    通过搞养猪“试验田”，全县已有三千名干部掌握了养猪规律和学会养猪的基本知识，有一千一百多名干部学会了饲养管理，并有三百七十多名干部成为饲养管理、采精配种、小猪接生、防疫打针的多面手。由于我们通过搞养猪“试验田”，加强了党的领导，解除了思想障碍，及时推广先进经验，解决问题，因而大大促进了养猪生产的高速度发展。到1959年年底全县共办了畜牧场三千零九十三个，比4月底增加172％；共有猪十六万九千多头，比4月增加60．8％。
    猪多、肥多、粮多，1959年全县粮食总产量比1958年增加35％。
