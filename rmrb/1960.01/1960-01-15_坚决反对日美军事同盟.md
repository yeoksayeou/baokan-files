Editorial:

    Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi has decided to visit the United States on the 16th of this month to sign a U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty with the U.S. government under the guise of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." This is an event that deserves close attention from people all over the world. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on January 14, pointing out that "this is an extremely serious step in which the Japanese reactionaries and U.S. imperialism collude with each other to prepare for new aggression and war, threatening peace in Asia and the world"; pointing out that "the signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty marks the revival of Japanese militarism and marks Japan's public participation in the U.S.'s aggressive military bloc"; demanding that the people of Asian countries be seriously vigilant and resolutely oppose the new war activities planned by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries; and expressing full support for the Japanese people to continue their struggle and strive to thwart the conspiracies of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. The Chinese people fully support the solemn statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and are determined to stand with the Japanese people and the people of Asian countries to fight to the end against the U.S.-Japan military alliance and to defend peace in the Far East and the world.
    Why is the revival of Japanese militarism and Japan's participation in the U.S.'s aggressive military bloc worthy of such attention? Because it is related not only to the fate of the Japanese people but also to the security of China and other Asian countries.
    People will never forget the terrible losses that the Japanese militarists' wars of aggression in the 1930s and 1940s caused to the Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries, as well as the serious consequences for the Japanese people themselves. In order to prevent such a painful history from repeating itself, the Allied countries, in the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation and the 1947 Far Eastern Commission's "Decision on Basic Post-Surrender Policy Toward Japan," made solemn declarations and clear stipulations on preventing the revival of Japanese militarism and Japan's re-aggression. After the war, the broad masses of the Japanese people also resolutely demanded to take the road of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. However, the United States, as the occupying power, violated relevant international agreements and the wishes of the Japanese people, deliberately preserved and fostered the most reactionary war remnants in Japan, making Japan a supply base for U.S. imperialism's aggression in the Far East. The Japanese militarist forces, in turn, relied on the United States to actively carry out restoration activities. This has formed a sharp struggle between two paths in Japan. The Chinese people, who have suffered greatly from the aggression of Japanese militarism, have always been concerned about Japan's future development and have resolutely supported the Japanese people's just struggle. In recent years, the Chinese government has continuously exposed the danger of the Japanese reactionaries, supported by U.S. imperialism, actively reviving Japanese militarism and carrying out external expansion. In particular, since Nobusuke Kishi came to power, the Chinese government has repeatedly warned that the latent imperialist desires and militarist ambitions of Japanese monopoly groups have become increasingly blatant, and Japan is being dragged onto the old road of war and aggression. Now, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, disregarding the strong opposition of the Japanese people and the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and all peace-loving countries in the world, openly renounce solemn international agreements and carry out further military collusion. If in the past Japan only played the role of a supply base for the U.S.'s aggressive wars in the Far East, then, according to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty that is about to be signed, Japan will become a formal member of the U.S. aggressive military bloc, be completely incorporated into the U.S. atomic strategy system, and directly serve as an accomplice to the U.S. in its aggression and expansion in the Far East. If Japanese militarist activities in the past still had to be somewhat restrained, then in the future, they will become even more blatant due to gaining a legitimate status. Seeing that the Japanese militarist forces, which fifteen years ago harmed China, Korea, Vietnam, Burma, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaya, and Singapore, are once again becoming a real threat to the people of Asian countries, this naturally cannot but arouse serious vigilance from the people of Asia and the world.
    The conclusion of the U.S.-Japan military alliance is a long-planned action by U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries. Their eagerness to implement it at present reflects the deepening difficulties on both sides. As far as the United States is concerned, as a result of carrying out aggression and expansion everywhere, it is not only increasingly isolated politically, but its military lines are too long, and it is stretched thin. Moreover, it has also experienced an unprecedented international balance of payments deficit financially. In order to get rid of this predicament, one of the important steps taken by U.S. imperialism is to use Japan in the East, just as it uses West Germany in the West, to take the brunt of its military efforts, share a portion of the financial burden, and use Japan's economic and technological strength to expand into Southeast Asia. As far as Japan is concerned, its situation is not much better than that of the United States. The abnormal development of Japan's industrial production and the contradiction between production capacity and sales and raw material markets have caused Japanese monopoly groups to face intractable difficulties. They are eager to establish a military alliance with the United States, develop Japan's military industry, turn Japan into the U.S.'s arsenal in the Far East, and, with the help of the United States, attempt to revive the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" aggression plan. In order to deceive the Japanese people, the Kishi Nobusuke government has in the past emphasized that revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" would strengthen Japan's independence and autonomy. However, according to the recent remarks by Foreign Minister Fujiyama, the Japanese government has even decided to abandon the clause in the treaty stipulating that the U.S. military stationed in Japan must consult with Japan in advance regarding taking war actions. This completely exposes the true relationship between the United States and Japan in the U.S.-Japan military alliance. As we have repeatedly pointed out, Japan's pursuit of the U.S.'s policy of war and aggression will make it even more devoid of independence and autonomy, enabling the U.S. to pull chestnuts out of the fire, and drag the Japanese people into the abyss of disaster.
    The actions of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries in concluding a military alliance run counter to the direction of the development of the international situation. Thanks to the joint efforts of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and peace-loving countries and peoples, the recent international situation has seen a certain degree of easing. Even the U.S. ruling clique has had to tout peace and make some gestures of willingness to ease international tensions. However, in reality, the United States is fully developing missile weapons, expanding missile bases, and even announcing its readiness to resume nuclear testing at any time. And the further military collusion between the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries further proves that the United States is not only continuing to strengthen existing military blocs, but also actively piecing together new military blocs centered on Japan, exacerbating tensions in Asia. This action by the United States once again exposes the "fake peace, real war preparations" tactics played by the U.S. ruling clique.
    In order to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance and strive for Japan's independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, the Japanese people have launched increasingly broad and in-depth struggles. Since last year, the Japanese people have held eleven nationwide unified actions, with more than ten million people participating in the struggle in various forms. The Chinese people express their warm respect to the heroic and unyielding Japanese people. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance and will never allow Japanese militarism to threaten China's socialist construction. We believe that the people of Asian countries will never allow Japanese militarism to do whatever it wants. The Japanese people are not isolated. Although their struggle is long-term and tortuous, as long as they unite and continue their efforts, they will surely achieve final victory. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' obstinacy will not only fail to suppress the Japanese people but will also further promote the unity and awakening of the Japanese people. As the statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out, "The times have changed. No matter how rampant the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are, their evil conspiracy to enslave the Japanese people and threaten the people of Asian countries is doomed to failure."

### 坚决反对日美军事同盟

    坚决反对日美军事同盟
    日本首相岸信介已经决定于本月16日访美，在修改日美“安全条约”的名义下，同美国政府签订日美军事同盟条约。这是一个值得全世界人民密切注视的事件。我国外交部在1月14日就此事发表声明，指出“这是日本反动派和美帝国主义互相勾结，准备新的侵略和战争，威胁亚洲和世界和平的一个极其严重的步骤”；指出“日美军事同盟条约的签订，标志着日本军国主义的复活，标志着日本已经公然参加美国的侵略性的军事集团”；要求亚洲各国人民严重警惕和坚决反对美日反动派策划新战争的活动；并且表示全力支持日本人民再接再厉地进行斗争，为挫败美日反动派的阴谋而努力。中国人民完全拥护我国外交部的严正声明，决心同日本人民、同亚洲各国人民在一起，为反对日美军事同盟、保卫远东和世界的和平奋斗到底。
    为什么日本军国主义复活和日本参加美国的侵略性军事集团值得引起这样的重视呢？因为这不仅关系着日本人民的命运，而且关系着中国和亚洲各国的安全。
    人们绝不会忘记，二十世纪三十年代到四十年代，日本军国主义所发动的侵略战争，曾经给中国人民、亚洲各国人民造成多么惨重的损失，同时也给日本人民带来多么严重的后果。为了使这种惨痛的历史不再重演，同盟国家在1945年的波茨坦公告和1947年远东委员会“对投降后日本之基本政策的决议”中，曾经对防止日本军国主义复活和日本再次进行侵略，作出了庄严的宣示和明确的规定。战后广大的日本人民也坚决要求走独立、民主、和平、中立的道路。但是，作为占领国的美国却违背有关的国际协议和日本人民的愿望，蓄意保存和扶植日本最反动的战争残余势力，使日本成为美帝国主义在远东进行侵略的供应基地。而日本军国主义势力则依附美国积极进行复辟活动。这就在日本形成了尖锐的两条道路的斗争。饱受日本军国主义侵略祸害的中国人民，一向关心日本的发展前途，坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争。近几年来，中国政府曾经不断揭露日本反动派在美帝国主义扶植下积极复活日本军国主义和对外进行扩张的危险性。特别是从岸信介登台以来，中国政府更一再警告，日本垄断集团潜在的帝国主义欲望和军国主义野心已经日益露骨地表现出来，日本正在被拖上战争和侵略的老路。现在，美日反动派竟然不顾日本人民的强烈反对，不顾中国人民和全世界爱好和平的各国人民的一再警告，公开毁弃庄严的国际协定，实行进一步的军事勾结。如果说过去日本对于美国在远东策动的侵略战争只是起着供应基地的作用，那么，按照行将签订的日美军事同盟条约，日本就成为美国侵略军事集团的正式成员，完全被纳入美国的原子战略体系，直接充当美国在远东侵略和扩张的帮凶。如果说过去日本军国主义的活动还不能不有所顾忌，那么，今后就会由于取得合法地位而变得更加明目张胆了。眼看十五年前祸害过中国、朝鲜、越南、缅甸、印度尼西亚、柬埔寨、老挝、泰国、菲律宾、马来亚、新加坡的日本军国主义势力，又要成为亚洲各国人民的现实威胁了。这自然不能不引起亚洲和世界各国人民的严重警惕。
    缔结日美军事同盟是美帝国主义和日本反动派蓄谋已久的行动，他们所以要在目前迫不及待地付诸实现，是反映了双方日益加深的困难。就美国而言，由于到处进行侵略扩张的结果，不仅政治上日益陷于孤立，军事上战线太长，捉襟见肘，而且财政上也出现了从来未有的国际收支逆差。为了摆脱这种困境，美帝国主义所采取的重要步骤之一，就是像在西方利用西德一样，在东方利用日本来为它在军事上顶头阵，在财政上分摊一部分负担，并且运用日本的经济技术力量向东南亚进行扩张。就日本而言，日子并不比美国好过一些。日本的工业生产的畸形发展以及生产力同销售和原料市场的矛盾，使日本垄断集团面临着难以解脱的困难。他们急于同美国建立军事同盟，发展日本的军需工业，把日本变成美国在远东的兵工厂，并且借助美国的力量，企图恢复所谓“大东亚共荣圈”的侵略计划。为了欺骗日本人民，岸信介政府过去十分强调修改日美“安全条约”将加强日本的独立自主。但是，根据最近藤山外相的谈话，日本政府连条约中有关驻日美军采取战争行动必须事先同日本协商的条款都决定放弃。这就完全揭穿了在日美军事同盟中，美国同日本究竟是怎样一种关系。正如我们所一再指出的，日本追随美国的战争侵略政策，将会使自己更加丧失独立自主，为美国火中取栗，把日本人民拖入灾难的深渊。
    美日反动派缔结军事同盟的行动是同国际形势发展的方向背道而驰的。由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和爱好和平的国家和人民的共同努力，最近国际局势出现了一定程度的和缓。连美国统治集团也不得不标榜和平，并且做出一些愿意和缓国际紧张局势的姿态。但是，实际上，美国正在全力发展导弹武器，扩大导弹基地，甚至宣布准备随时恢复核试验。而美日反动派在军事上的进一步勾结，更加证明美国不仅在继续加强现有的军事集团，并且在积极拼凑以日本为中心的新的军事集团，加剧亚洲的紧张局势。美国的这种行动，又一次暴露了美国统治集团所玩弄的“假和平、真备战”的手法。
    为了反对日美军事同盟，争取日本的独立、民主、和平、中立，日本人民开展了越来越广泛、越来越深入的斗争。从去年以来，日本人民举行了十一次全国规模的统一行动，以各种形式参加斗争的人数超过了一千万以上。中国人民向英勇不屈的日本人民致以热烈的敬意。中国人民坚决反对日美军事同盟，决不容许日本军国主义威胁中国的社会主义建设事业。我们相信，亚洲各国人民也决不会允许日本军国主义为所欲为。日本人民决不是孤立的，尽管他们的斗争是长期的、曲折的，但是只要团结一致，再接再厉，他们就一定能够取得最后的胜利。美日反动派的一意孤行，不仅压不倒日本人民，而且将更加促进日本人民的团结和觉悟。正如我国外交部声明所指出的，“时代已经变了，不管美日反动派如何猖獗，他们奴役日本人民，威胁亚洲各国人民的罪恶阴谋是注定要失败的。”
