Xinhua News Agency, Beijing - The people of the capital are joyously welcoming the first New Year of the 1960s.

    The solemn Tiananmen Square has been adorned with new decorations, and eight large red gauze lanterns are hanging high on the city gate tower. In buildings such as the Great Hall of the People, the Cultural Palace of Nationalities, and the Overseas Chinese Mansion, people are singing and dancing, celebrating the victory of the Great Leap Forward. Many places have erected festive banners with slogans such as "Long Live the General Line!" "Long Live the Great Leap Forward!" "Long Live the People's Commune!"

    Many factories in the capital have already completed or exceeded their January production plans ahead of schedule. On New Year's Eve, after having their "reunion dinner," workers took their families to attend the get-together held by their factory's trade union. The Beijing Electron Tube Factory, which proposed to workers nationwide before the New Year to continue the leap forward this year, held a masquerade ball on New Year's Eve. Xiong Jie, the factory's Party Committee Secretary, congratulated the workers on the Spring Festival, and the workers pledged to the Party that production would continue to rise after the Spring Festival. More than a dozen Soviet experts from the factory were also invited to the ball, and the experts warmly congratulated the workers on the New Year.

    The members of the suburban People's Communes, who overcame the extraordinary flooding and achieved a bumper harvest, cleaned their houses thoroughly and pasted red Spring Festival couplets with slogans such as "Communism is Paradise, the People's Commune is the Bridge" and "Good Harvest of Grain, Renewal of Everything" on both sides of their gates. On New Year's Eve, the commune members brought their families to the public canteen for a grand reunion dinner and then participated in the get-together.

    On the first day of the New Year, more than one hundred amateur poets and poets from the capital's industrial and commercial sectors held a poetry competition at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. They improvised poems, wrote on the spot, and sang praises to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. The poetry competition was held in the house in the West Forest of the Cultural Palace. Li Xue'ao, a worker-poet from the People's Printing Factory, was the first to post his impromptu work on the "Poetry Garden" on the wall: "Three Red Flags Fluttering in the Sky, Songs High Under the Red Flags, Singers of the Capital Gather Together, Waves Rolling in the Sea of Poetry." Zhang Jichun, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers, then posted his "Song of Happiness": "Happy Life, Happy Songs, Many Poets in the Great Leap Forward Era. Red Flags Fluttering, Mountains and Rivers Smiling, Good Spring in the Sixties, Singing the General Line Shining, Singing the Great Leap Forward with High Enthusiasm..." The poetry competition lasted for four hours.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th - The people of Shanghai, who have continuously achieved brilliant successes in the Great Leap Forward for two years and a good start in production this year, are joyfully celebrating the Spring Festival.

    Today, the heads of Party committees, administrative departments, and trade unions of many factories visited workers' families. As in previous years, leaders from the factory's Party committee and administrative department came to the home of Zhang Qingquan, a sixty-three-year-old retired worker from the Pengpu Machine Factory, to congratulate him on the New Year. But today, Cheng Yuhui, the Party Branch Secretary of the Zhonghua Pharmaceutical Factory, and Song Xingcui, a female packaging worker, also came. It turned out that Zhang Qingquan had helped the workers of the Zhonghua Pharmaceutical Factory to make a machine for packaging Rendan pills, which can package more than 80,000 Rendan pills per day, equivalent to the work of forty people. Cheng Yuhui said to the old man with a smile: "You are a retired worker from the Pengpu Machine Factory, but now you have become a member of our factory." Zhang Qingquan said with a smile: "Whether it is for the Zhonghua Factory or the Pengpu Factory, it is all contributing to socialism."

    The neighborhood residents who established various production and welfare organizations during the Great Leap Forward are having a more colorful Spring Festival this year. Zhangjiazhai is one of the tens of thousands of neighborhoods in Shanghai, where every family has bought New Year's goods and made new clothes. At nine o'clock this morning, the women came to their production team for a New Year's greeting. Amidst the sound of gongs, drums, and firecrackers, the young women sang their own songs, praising the happy new life.

    In the one hundred and seventy-two People's Communes in the suburbs of Shanghai, everyone is jubilant today. Every household has posted red Spring Festival couplets praising the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune; cultural and recreational activities are also unprecedentedly active. Amateur cultural troupes in each commune in Chongming County rehearsed more than seven hundred programs, achieving "every team has a show to watch, every canteen has songs to sing."

    Today, thousands of workers, farmers, students, and government cadres in Shanghai also organized New Year's visiting teams, beating gongs and drums, to visit the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to extend New Year's greetings and carry out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 28th - The people of Tianjin are happily welcoming the first Spring Festival of the 1960s.

    On New Year's Eve, more than forty thousand steelworkers in Tianjin fought hard by the furnace.

Party and government leaders of many factories also participated in the battle for steel production with the workers, welcoming the New Year with new production achievements.

    After the city's workers finished their last shift on New Year's Eve, many people put on festive costumes, brought their families, and went to theaters and cultural palaces to play until late at night. Many theaters performed almost all night. The First Workers' Cultural Palace held a "Welcoming Spring Poetry Competition" in the Spring Festival Hall on New Year's Eve, and the poet Tian Jian and others also competed in poetry with the workers. Painters also painted portraits for the labor models here.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 28th - Wuhan today is bathed in sunshine, and the people of the city are joyfully celebrating the Spring Festival.

    Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, wrote a poem "Spring Festival Overture" today for the people celebrating the Spring Festival, calling on the people of the province to strive for a sustained Great Leap Forward in all aspects of production this year.

    Today, the city's cultural and recreational activities are also rich and colorful. All theaters and troupes staged wonderful programs. The Wuhan People's Art Theater staged "A Riot of Color is Spring," which was adapted from the advanced deeds of Wu Lianghu, a worker from the Jiang'an Vehicle Factory who attended the National Congress of Heroes. Today, tens of thousands of people also enjoyed wonderful basketball, football games, motorcycle, wrestling, and martial arts performances at the Wuhan Xinhua Stadium, Gymnasium, and other places. Zhang Tixue, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Hubei Province, and other Party, government, and military leaders had a get-together with more than eighty retired veteran Red Army soldiers in Wuhan on the 26th.

The vast number of workers were elated and held grand evening parties, New Year's gatherings, get-togethers, and dances on New Year's Eve. The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company held various evening parties at dozens of locations on New Year's Eve. At the evening party held in the open-hearth furnace workshop of the company, the chorus program performed by the steelworkers was particularly exciting. It sang the heroic deeds of the workers who fought hard in the battle against sulfur, made high-quality steel from local iron, and broke the daily output of a thousand tons. At the New Year's gathering in the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine, the repair workers performed a program praising the advanced figures of the mine: "Coal Miner Wang Zhizhong Fights the Methane Pass." When the program was over, the audience applauded like spring thunder, and the hero Wang Zhizhong also applauded with everyone.
