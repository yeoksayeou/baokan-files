Xinhua News Agency, January 28th -- The All-China Women's Federation recently issued a notice to the women's federations of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, stating that in order to more fully leverage the active role of women in fulfilling and overfulfilling the 1960 national construction plan, it has been decided to reward 10,000 advanced women individuals and women-led advanced collectives on all fronts of socialist construction in 1959 when commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of "March 8th" International Women's Day. They will be awarded the titles of "March 8th Red Banner Pacesetter" and "March 8th Red Banner Collective" along with certificates and flags.

    The notice put forward the standards for advanced individuals and advanced collectives as follows: (1) ideologically sound and full of drive; (2) making great strides in technical innovation and technical revolution in industrial and agricultural production, collective living welfare and social service undertakings, and on all fronts of socialist construction, constantly improving labor productivity and work efficiency; (3) striving to improve cultural level, diligently studying and delving into science; (4) good at uniting the masses and promoting the spirit of communist collaboration. Anyone who meets the above conditions or one of them, and has made outstanding achievements in completing production or work plans, can be called a national advanced women producer, advanced worker, or advanced collective.

    The notice said that national advanced women producers, advanced workers, or advanced collectives should be nominated and elected through mass discussions. All industrial and mining enterprises, people's communes, organizations, and schools can adopt appropriate and simple methods for nomination and election.

    The notice requested that after receiving the notice, the women's federations of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should, under the leadership of the local Party committees, widely and thoroughly carry out publicity and education work among the women masses. In the current socialist education movement, in the production increase and economy practice movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, a more widespread and in-depth socialist labor emulation drive to learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the less advanced should be launched. Through competition, more advanced women individuals and advanced women collectives will emerge, using more, better, and more outstanding achievements to greet the fiftieth anniversary of "March 8th" International Women's Day. On this basis, organize and mobilize women and people across the country to work together to achieve a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward in 1960.
