　　Riding on the favorable opportunity of cold air moving southward and temperatures dropping, some areas south of the Five Ridges are seizing the time to kill lychee pests. In Conghua County, Guangdong, the suburban, Jiangpu, and Taiping communes have mobilized more than 12,000 people to launch a concentrated attack to eliminate the weevil, which poses the greatest threat to lychee trees.

　　The weevil has historically been the biggest threat to lychee trees, sucking the sap from the young stems of fruit trees and biting off lychee blossoms, preventing the lychees from bearing fruit. Drawing lessons from the past, Conghua County is implementing the policy of "early, small, and thorough elimination" and has organized this campaign to eradicate pests. (Attached picture)

    乘天寒扑灭荔枝害虫
    本报讯　五岭以南一些地区正抓紧冷空气南下，气温下降的大好时机，捕杀荔枝害虫。广东从化县城郊、江埔、太平等公社，出动一万二千多人，突击扑灭对荔枝树为害最大的象鼻虫。
    象鼻虫历年来对荔枝树威胁最大，它吸食果树的幼茎液汁，咬断荔枝花，使荔枝不能结果。从化县吸取过去的教训，贯彻“打早、打小、打了”的方针，组织了这次突击扑杀虫害的运动。（附图片）
