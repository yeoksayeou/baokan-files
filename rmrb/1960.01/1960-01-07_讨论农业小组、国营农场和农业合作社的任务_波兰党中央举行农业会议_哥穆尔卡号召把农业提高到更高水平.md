Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 5th. The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party held an agricultural conference on the 4th to discuss the basic tasks of agricultural groups in the recent period, as well as the urgent tasks of state farms and agricultural production cooperatives.

The conference was attended by the agricultural secretaries of the provincial committees, the Minister of Rural Affairs, and the heads of the central agricultural departments.

Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, attended the conference.

Edward Ochab, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a report on the work and tasks of agricultural groups.

Gomułka spoke at the conference. He pointed out that political work in the countryside is still not as active as required. He said that in order to realize the proposal to supply agricultural groups with machinery and raise agriculture to a higher level, Party organizations and Party organs at all levels must be good at organizing rural work in winter.

Gomułka emphasized that every Party member in the countryside must participate in agricultural groups, and Party organizations must concentrate their efforts on developing and consolidating agricultural groups.

Gomułka then pointed out that work must be intensified especially in the next three months, and meetings and discussions should be held extensively. He said: Whether we can complete the task and implement the resolutions of the Third Congress of the Party and the Second Plenary Session depends on whether we can use our time and how we talk to the peasants.

Gomułka also pointed out that it is necessary to correctly select personnel to learn about tractors and further train personnel in this area.

When discussing the tasks of state farms, the conference pointed out that the main task of state farms this year is to completely eliminate the existing unprofitable state farms in the country. Next year, in principle, there should not be a single unprofitable state farm in the country.

When discussing the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives, the participants at the conference pointed out that the slow progress in this area in the past two years has been largely due to the lack of in-depth political work by Party organizations.

Ochab said at the close of the meeting that the current situation in the countryside is conducive to achieving the various tasks of increasing agricultural production, but it is necessary to seize the recent period and directly discuss the various issues raised by the Second Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party with the peasants.

    讨论农业小组、国营农场和农业合作社的任务
    波兰党中央举行农业会议
    哥穆尔卡号召把农业提高到更高水平
    新华社华沙5日电　波兰统一工人党中央委员会4日举行农业会议，讨论了最近时期农业小组的基本任务，以及国营农场和农业生产合作社的迫切任务。
    参加会议的有各省委会农业书记、农村工作部长以及中央农业部门的负责人。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡出席了会议。
    波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员、中央书记奥哈布在会上作了关于农业小组的工作和任务的报告。
    哥穆尔卡在会上讲了话。他指出，农村的政治工作仍然不像所要求的那样活跃。他说，要实现关于供给农业小组机器的主张，并把农业提高到更高的水平，党的组织和党的各级机关必须善于在冬季组织农村工作。
    哥穆尔卡着重指出，在农村中每一个党员都必须参加农业小组，党组织必须集中力量来发展和巩固农业小组。
    哥穆尔卡接着指出，在最近三个月内必须特别加紧工作，广泛地举行会议和讨论会。他说：能否完成任务和实现党的第三次代表大会和二中全会的决议，要看我们能否利用时间以及我们怎样同农民交谈。
    哥穆尔卡还指出，必须正确选择人员去学拖拉机和进一步培养这方面的人材。
    会议在讨论国营农场的任务时指出，今年国营农场的主要任务是彻底消灭国内现有的不赢利的国营农场。明年，国内原则上不应有一个不赢利的国营农场。
    参加会议的人在谈到巩固和发展农业生产合作社的问题时指出，最近两年来在这方面的缓慢进展，在很大程度上是由于党组织的政治工作不深入所造成的。
    奥哈布在会议闭幕时说，目前农村的形势有利于实现提高农业生产的各项任务，但是必须抓紧最近时期，同农民们直接讨论统一工人党二中全会提出的各项问题。
