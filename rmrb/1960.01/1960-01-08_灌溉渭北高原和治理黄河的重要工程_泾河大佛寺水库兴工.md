Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 7th -- The Jinghe Dafosi Reservoir, the largest water irrigation project in Shaanxi Province that draws water to the Weibei Plateau, has recently officially started construction.

The Dafosi Reservoir is located in the western part of Bin County, in the middle reaches of the Jinghe River. The Jinghe River is one of the main tributaries of the Yellow River, with a main stream of approximately 450 kilometers in length and five tributaries including the Malian and Heihe Rivers, which converge above Dafosi. The average annual water volume of the Jinghe River in the Dafosi area is 1.81 billion cubic meters, and the annual sediment transport is 200 million cubic meters, making it one of the tributaries of the Yellow River with a relatively large sediment transport volume. The Dafosi Reservoir project is a key project for harnessing the Jinghe River basin, controlling the Jinghe River's water volume, and realizing water conservancy on the Weibei Plateau in Shaanxi, and is also an important component of harnessing the Yellow River. After the reservoir is completed, it can store 1.58 billion cubic meters of water, irrigate more than 4.13 million mu of farmland in six counties (cities) including Tongchuan, Sanyuan, Lintong, Weinan, Pucheng, and Dali, generate approximately 20,000 kilowatts of electricity through stepped hydropower, and open up more than 400 kilometers of seasonal navigation routes. After the reservoir is completed, it will also play a significant role in protecting the Sanmenxia Reservoir due to its large-scale control of soil erosion.

The Dafosi Reservoir project includes four items: a dam, a water diversion tunnel, a spillway, and a power station. The earth dam is 64 meters high, 745 meters long at the base, 1,027 meters long at the top, 464 meters wide at the bottom, and 8 meters wide at the top. The earth dam is mainly built of loess, which is currently the largest homogeneous earth dam in the country. The characteristics of this type of dam are low labor requirements, low costs, and the use of locally produced materials. The tunnel is circular with a diameter of five meters and a length of six hundred meters. The spillway is eight hundred meters long and seventy meters wide at the base. Excluding the power station, the total earthwork and stonework is approximately 21.1 million cubic meters.

Since last winter, the Dafosi Reservoir project has been actively carrying out construction preparation work. To date, more than 4,000 cave dwellings have been dug and more than 800 kitchen sheds have been built, solving the food and lodging problems of the migrant workers. Some labor has also been drawn to work 790,000 man-days on the foundation clearing of the earth dam and the excavation of the tunnel and spillway, completing 1.99 million cubic meters of earthwork and stonework.

    灌溉渭北高原和治理黄河的重要工程
    泾河大佛寺水库兴工
    新华社西安7日电　陕西省最大的引水上塬水利灌溉工程——泾河大佛寺水库，最近正式开工。
    大佛寺水库位于邠县西部、泾河的中游。泾河是黄河的主要支流之一，干流全长约四百五十公里，并有马连、黑河等五条支流，在大佛寺以上汇流。泾河在大佛寺地区每年平均水量为十八点一亿立方米，年输沙量两亿立方米，是黄河输沙量比较大的支流之一。大佛寺水库工程是治理泾河流域、控制泾河水量和实现陕西渭北高原水利化的关键工程，也是治理黄河的重要组成部分。这个水库建成后，可以蓄水十五点八亿立方米，灌溉铜川、三原、临潼、渭南、蒲城、大荔等六个县（市）四百一十三万多亩农田，用跌水发电两万瓩左右，还可以开辟季节性的航运路线四百多公里。这个水库建成后，由于大量的控制泥土流失，对保护三门峡水库也有很大作用。
    大佛寺水库工程共包括拦河大坝、输水隧洞、溢洪道和发电站等四项。土坝高六十四米，底长七百四十五米，顶长一千零二十七米，底部最宽四百六十四米，顶宽八米。土坝主要是由黄土堆筑，这是全国目前最大的均质土坝。这种坝的特点是用工少，成本低，器材多为本地出产。隧洞圆形直径五米，长六百米。溢洪道长八百米，底宽七十米。除电站外，全部土石方工程共约两千一百余万立方米。
    去冬以来，大佛寺水库工程就积极地进行了施工准备工作，到目前为止，已经打窑洞四千多孔，盖灶棚八百多间，解决了民工的食宿问题。还抽了部分劳力对土坝清基、隧洞、溢洪道开挖等工程作了七十九万多个工日，完成土石方一百九十九万立方米。
