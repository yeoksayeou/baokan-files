    Promote Agricultural Technology Innovation and Drive the High-Yield Movement
    Cadres at All Levels Persist in Cultivating Experimental Fields
    New Characteristics: Closely Combined with Commune Members and Technicians to Conduct Experiments on Large Pieces of Land
    (Our Dispatch) In 1959, cadres across the country, in their leadership of production and work, more widely utilized and developed the method of cultivating experimental fields, achieving great results. The broad masses of cadres further improved their leadership style and enriched their experience in leading production.
    In 1959, the experimental fields cultivated by the broad masses of cadres were mostly conducted by leading cadres in combination with the broad masses of commune members and agricultural technicians, experimenting on relatively large plots of land, and establishing many high-yield plots and red banner fields. In this way, the cultivation of experimental fields developed into a mass high-yield movement. According to statistics from eight provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, including Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and Jilin, cadres at all levels, in conjunction with commune members and agricultural technicians, cultivated a total of more than 3.8 million mu of experimental fields and high-yield plots. The yields of these experimental fields and high-yield plots were all higher than those of ordinary fields, some by one or two times, and even six or seven times. Last year in Hunan Province, more than 177,000 cadres, in conjunction with two million commune members and agricultural technicians, cultivated experimental fields. Compared with ordinary fields, these experimental fields generally increased production by 20% to 30%. In Faku County, Liaoning Province, more than 4,900 cadres, in conjunction with more than 10,000 commune members and agricultural technicians, cultivated more than 71,000 mu of red banner fields, accounting for 5% of the county's grain crop area, but accounting for 14.35% of the total grain output. In Huicheng County, Gansu Province, more than 1,200 office cadres, in combination with the masses, cultivated more than 2,500 mu of experimental fields. In these experimental fields, they created many new high-yield records, such as a wheat yield of 1,300 jin per mu, a corn yield of 8,140 jin per mu, and a potato yield of 31,400 jin per mu.
    Leading cadres leaving their offices, abandoning their airs, and cultivating experimental fields together with peasants is the most effective method for improving leadership style. Many cadres, through cultivating experimental fields, further strengthened their ties with the masses, strengthened their integration with production, and they became people who are in the city, but their hearts are in the countryside, people who are in the commune, but their hearts are in the fields. Many people have achieved "cadre peasantization, regular labor, and mass lifestyle." Liu Yucheng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Xianxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province, cultivated two mu of high-yield wheat experimental fields in the Nanhetou People's Commune, and often got up early to collect manure. Commune members said, "Secretary Liu is so busy with his work, but he still collects manure every day. We must learn from him." Since then, many commune members have also gotten up early to collect manure.
    Through cultivating experimental fields, the cadres' thinking has been transformed, and their production skills have also become proficient. A large number of cadres who are both red and expert are rapidly growing. Many cadres, through cultivating experimental fields, have learned a series of agricultural production techniques such as plowing, sowing, weeding, and fertilizing. Cadres in Hongan County, Hubei Province, after two years of practice, whether they are rural work cadres or office cadres, and whether they are leading cadres or general cadres, almost everyone is an expert in agricultural production. After mastering agricultural technology, many cadres actively study other technologies. Now, many cadres have been evaluated by the masses as "five-member" cadres, "five-understand" cadres, and "five-capable" cadres. The so-called "five members" are water conservancy technicians, livestock epidemic prevention personnel, fruit tree grafting personnel, propagandists, and accountants; the so-called "five understands" are understanding soil structure, variety characteristics, plant protection, cultivation technology, and farming system reform; the so-called "five capable" are being able to produce, able to work, able to write articles, able to innovate technology, and able to invent and create.
    Leading cadres combining with the broad masses of commune members and agricultural technicians to cultivate experimental fields enables the timely promotion of various advanced experiences and yield-increasing measures, and powerfully promotes agricultural technology innovation. Last year, the experimental fields cultivated by cadres everywhere universally promoted advanced farming techniques such as deep plowing, layered fertilization, and rational close planting. Last year, Jintang Management District of Jinzhong Commune, Hezhang County, Guizhou Province, newly opened up some paddy fields. Local commune members believed that the mountains were high and the water was cold, and they could only grow grass to feed cattle, and could not grow rice. Later, Wang Jinchen and Yao Shigang, leading cadres of the commune party committee, personally conducted experiments in a small plot of land, taking measures such as increasing fertilizer application, improving farming techniques, and transplanting seedlings early. As a result, the seedlings grew very vigorously and harvested 545 jin of rice.

    促进农业技术革新推动高额丰产运动
    各级干部坚持种试验田
    新的特点：和社员、技术员紧密结合在大块土地上进行试验
    本报讯　全国各地干部1959年在领导生产和工作中，更广泛地运用和发展了种试验田这一领导方法，取得了很大的成绩，广大干部进一步改进了领导作风，丰富了领导生产的经验。
    1959年广大干部种的试验田，大都是由领导干部同广大社员、农业技术人员结合在一起，在比较大块的土地上试验，建立了许多丰产片、红旗田。这样，就使种试验田发展成了一个群众性的高额丰产运动。据湖北、湖南、安徽、吉林等八个省、市和自治区的统计，各级干部同公社社员和农业技术人员相结合，一共种了三百八十多万亩试验田和丰产片，这些试验田和丰产片的产量都比一般田高，有的高出一、两倍以至六、七倍。湖南省去年有十七万七千多名干部同二百万社员和农业技术人员结合起来，种试验田，这些试验田同一般田比较，普遍增产两成到三成。辽宁省法库县四千九百多名干部同一万多名社员、农业技术人员相结合，种了七万一千多亩红旗田，占全县粮食作物面积的5％，而粮食产量却占总产量的14．35％。甘肃省徽成县一千二百多机关干部同群众结合种了二千五百多亩试验田，在这些试验田中，创造了小麦亩产一千三百斤、玉米亩产八千一百四十斤、洋芋亩产三万一千四百斤等许多高产新纪录。
    领导干部走出办公室，放下架子，同农民一起种试验田，这是改进领导作风最有效的方法。许多干部通过种试验田，进一步加强了同群众的联系，加强了同生产的结合，他们变得人在城里，心在农村，人在社里，心在田里。许多人做到“干部农民化，劳动经常化，生活群众化”。中共河北省献县县委书记处书记刘玉成，在南河头人民公社种了二亩小麦丰产试验田，经常起早拾粪。社员们说：“刘书记工作这么忙，还天天拾粪，咱们可得好好向他学习”。从此，许多社员也起早拾粪。
    通过种试验田，干部思想得到了改造，生产技术也熟练了，大批的又红又专的干部正在迅速成长。许多干部通过种试验田，学会了犁田、播种、锄禾、施肥等一系列农业生产技术。湖北省红安县干部，经过两年来的实践，不论是农村工作干部还是机关干部，也不论是领导干部还是一般干部，几乎个个都是农业生产的内行。许多干部在掌握了农业技术以后，又积极学习其它技术。现在，已经有不少干部被群众评为“五员”干部、“五懂”干部、“五能”干部。所谓“五员”，就是水利技术员、牲畜防疫员、果木嫁接员，宣传员、会计员；所谓“五懂”，就是懂土壤结构、品种特性、植物保护、栽培技术、耕作制度改革；所谓“五能”，就是能生产、能工作、能写文章、能革新技术、能发明创造。
    领导干部同广大社员和农业技术人员结合种试验田，使各种先进经验和增产措施得以及时推广，有力地促进了农业技术革新。各地干部去年种的试验田，普遍推广了深耕、分层施肥和合理密植等先进耕作技术。贵州省赫章县金钟公社水塘管理区去年新开辟了一些稻田，当地社员认为山高水冷，只能种草喂牛，不能种稻。后来公社党委领导干部王金臣和姚世刚亲自在一小块田里进行试验，采取增施肥料、改进耕作技术和提早插秧等措施，结果秧苗长得十分茁壮，收获了五百四十五斤稻谷。
