Great Changes on the Loess Plateau
    Night-Shining Pearl Illuminates the Sanguankou

    Sanguankou is rumored to be where Yang Liulang, of the Yang family generals in the Northern Song Dynasty, defended against the Liao and Xia dynasties, leading troops to garrison the area. Therefore, the legend of "Yang Liulang Guarding Sanguankou" is almost universally known. The peaks of Sanguankou are steep, and the valleys are narrow and dangerous. In 1949, when the People's Liberation Army liberated the Northwest, Ma Hongkui's bandit gang attempted to rely on this natural barrier to resist the PLA's advance. However, the PLA routed them in a matter of hours.

    However, in the past, Sanguankou had nothing but a dozen or so households. It only became lively during the Great Leap Forward in steel production in 1958. Now, a cement factory has been established here, utilizing the rich limestone of the Liupan Mountains to produce large quantities of cement. The workers at the cement factory also used the river water in the valley to build a two-li-long canal and established a small hydroelectric power station on the hillside, solving the power and lighting problems for the cement factory. This has brought great light to the valley of Sanguankou, and they are also preparing to install electric lights in nearby villages. Local Hui farmers call the hydropower station the "Night-Shining Pearl." They joyfully sing: The Night-Shining Pearl needs no oil or coal, mountain streams are its power source, the strength of socialism is boundless, it illuminates the mountains and sky of Sanguankou, the old society was dark even in the daytime, the new society is as bright as day even at night.

    Plateau Reservoirs Become Fish Farms

    "Thousands of gullies and ravines build reservoirs, clear blue waves chase schools of fish, towering dams lock in the dragon, reservoirs become fish farms." This is the Jiangnan scenery added to the Loess Plateau by the Hui and Han people of the Guyuan Special District in the Loess Plateau gully area after building mountain reservoirs. In the past, many Hui and Han farmers here had never seen fish. Developing fish farming has also been their wish for many years. While building the reservoirs, they simultaneously built dams, stored water, and sent people to other places to purchase high-quality fish species. Now, millions of fish fry have been released into more than ten reservoirs, including grass carp and silver carp brought from Jiangnan, as well as Yellow River carp from the "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall," the Ningxia Plain. Some reservoirs, which released fish fry in May last year, now have fish weighing two or three jin. Some Hui and Han farmers near the reservoirs have already eaten fresh fish they raised themselves. Now, the reservoirs have formed layers of crystal ice. Every morning, commune members brave the cold winds of the plateau, venturing onto the "silver lake" to knock open ice holes, allowing the fish to safely overwinter.

    Apple Trees on Liupan Mountain

    The first artificially cultivated apple orchard has appeared on the high Liupan Mountain. This high-altitude apple orchard is built on the Erlong River hillside of Liupan Mountain, at an altitude of two thousand meters above sea level, with more than 4,900 cultivated apple trees.

    The Liupan Mountain area is a high-altitude, cold mountain area at an elevation of approximately 2,500 meters. Last year, the workers of the Guanshan Forest Management Station, displaying a spirit of daring to think and daring to act, transferred excellent apple scions from the Northeast and grafted them using wild fruit trees as rootstock. After grafting, under the threat of multiple snowstorms and frosts, the workers took various frost and cold protection measures, overcoming the various difficulties of high mountains and cold weather. They finally achieved a survival rate of over 90% for the apple trees. Currently, the grafted apple trees have grown new branches that are two or three chi high. Local Hui people praise this initiative of the forestry workers in this way:

    The forestry workers are heroic men, their enthusiasm surpasses Liupan Mountain,
    Their wisdom is as abundant as the Jing River's water, turning barren slopes into apple orchards.
    Scions are cut and grafted beneath Changbai Mountain, then grafted on Liupan, thousands of miles away,
    Everyone loves the apple orchard, the Party's leadership is highly commendable. (Attached Image)

    黄土高原变化多
    夜明珠照亮了三关口
  三关口传说是北宋杨家将中的杨六郎北拒辽夏，率兵镇守的地方。所以“杨六郎镇守三关口”的传说，几乎人人皆知。三关口山峰陡峭，峡谷隘险。1949年人民解放军解放大西北时，马鸿逵匪帮曾企图依此天险，抗拒人民解放军的进攻，结果被人民解放军在几小时内就打得鼠窜而逃。
    可是，过去三关口除了住着十几户人家外，什么都没有。1958年大炼钢铁时，这里才热闹起来。现在这里已经办起了水泥厂，利用六盘山丰富的石灰石，大量制造水泥。水泥厂的工人们又利用峡谷里的河水，开了一条两华里的水渠，在山坡上建立了一个小型水力发电站，解决了水泥厂的动力和照明问题，使三关口的峡谷里大放光明，并且还准备给附近村庄安装电灯。当地回族农民把水电站叫作“夜明珠”。他们喜悦地歌唱着：夜明珠不用油和炭，山沟小河当电源，社会主义力量大无边，它照亮了三关口的山和天，旧社会白天也黑暗，新社会夜晚如白天。
    高原水库成鱼田
    “千沟万壑修水库，清水碧波逐鱼泛，大坝巍峨锁蛟龙，座座水库成鱼田。”这是位于西北黄土高原沟壑区的固原专区回汉族人民兴建山区水库后，为黄土高原增添的江南景色。过去这里的许多回汉族农民从来没有看见过鱼。发展养鱼业也是他们多年来的想望。他们在修建水库时，一边打坝，一边蓄水，一边就派人到外地购买优良鱼种。现在十多座水库里已经放养的鱼苗有数百万尾，其中有从江南运来的草鱼、鲢鱼，也有产自“塞上江南”宁夏平原的黄河鲤鱼。有些水库从去年5月放养的鱼苗，现在已经长得有二、三斤重。水库附近的有些回汉族农民，已经吃到了自己亲手养育的鲜鱼。现在各个水库已经结上了晶莹的冰层。每天清晨，社员们冒着高原寒风，出动在“银湖”上，敲打冰眼，让鱼安全过冬。
    苹果树上六盘山
    高高的六盘山上已经出现了第一个人工培植的苹果园。这个高山苹果园建在六盘山拔海二千米的二龙河山坡上，其中培育的苹果树有四千九百多株。
    六盘山区是拔海二千五百米左右的高寒山区。去年，关山森林管理所的工人发扬敢想敢干精神，从东北调来优良苹果接穗，用野生果树作砧木进行嫁接。嫁接以后，在多次风雪和寒霜的威胁下，工人们采取了各种防霜、防寒措施，战胜了山高天寒的各种困难，终于使苹果树的成活率达到90％以上，目前嫁接的苹果树已经长出二、三尺高的新枝。当地回族人民这样赞美着林业工人的这一创举：
    林业工人英雄汉，干劲高过六盘山，
    智慧多似泾河水，荒坡尽成苹果园。
    长白山下剪接穗，嫁接六盘万里遥，
    苹果园林人人爱，党的领导功劳高。（附图片）
