    Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
    Resolution on Supporting the Appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the Parliaments and Governments of All Countries on the Issue of Disarmament
    (Adopted at the 12th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress on January 21, 1960)
    On January 15, 1960, the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed a bill on further reducing the armed forces of the Soviet Union by 1.2 million troops, and issued an appeal on the issue of disarmament to the parliaments and governments of all countries in the world. This is another major peaceful action taken by the Soviet Union to promote universal disarmament following its proposal for complete and thorough disarmament on September 18, 1959. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China warmly welcomes and supports this peaceful initiative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and believes that this initiative will have a favorable impact on further easing international tensions.
    However, in contrast to the Soviet Union's unremitting efforts to strive for universal disarmament, the US ruling clique has consistently adhered to arms expansion and war preparations, and has tried every possible means to obstruct the reaching of an agreement on the issue of disarmament. Taking the recent period as an example, the US government has openly announced the resumption of nuclear weapons testing at any time, continued to maintain military spending for the next fiscal year at the highest level in peacetime, accelerated the development of rocket manufacturing and production, and actively expanded overseas missile bases. Not only that, but the United States is also accelerating the arming of West Germany and strengthening existing aggressive military blocs, while at the same time signing a military alliance treaty with Japan, reviving Japanese militarism. This situation, as foreseen in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, threatens the security of the people of all countries in the Far East and peace in Asia. All this thoroughly exposes that the peace touted by the US ruling clique is false, and it is engaging in war preparations in the name of peace. All peace-loving people must be vigilant about this.
    The People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a peaceful policy and has never hesitated to make its own possible efforts to promote universal disarmament. Although the United States rejected the reasonable proposal put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers still took the initiative to withdraw from Korea in 1958. Although the US military still occupies our territory of Taiwan, US military bases surround half of China, and the US air and naval forces constantly violate China's territorial waters and airspace, China has still continuously taken a series of measures since 1951 to substantially reduce its armed forces. These tremendous efforts by China have won the sympathy and support of all peace-loving countries and peoples.
    The issue of disarmament is an important issue in maintaining world peace at present. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress welcomes the prompt reaching of an agreement on the issue of universal disarmament by the countries concerned. China has always supported universal disarmament and will not hesitate to undertake the international obligations it agrees to undertake. However, it must be pointed out that without the formal participation of the People's Republic of China and the signature of its representatives, international agreements on disarmament cannot, of course, have any binding force on China. Now, regardless of the obstruction and sabotage of disarmament by imperialism, the momentum of the world's people demanding universal disarmament is growing stronger and stronger. The Chinese people will, together with the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and peoples, wage unremitting struggle for the realization of complete and thorough disarmament and for the attainment of lasting peace.

### 关于支持苏联最高苏维埃就裁军问题致各国议会和政府呼吁书的决议

    全国人民代表大会常务委员会
    关于支持苏联最高苏维埃就裁军问题致各国议会和政府呼吁书的决议
    （一九六○年一月二十一日第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会第十二次会议通过）
    1960年1月15日苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议通过了关于苏联再一次裁减武装部队一百二十万人的法案，并且就裁军问题向世界各国议会和政府发出了呼吁书。这是苏联继1959年9月18日提出全面彻底裁军的建议之后，为促进普遍裁军而主动采取的又一次重大和平行动。中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会热烈欢迎和支持苏联最高苏维埃这一和平倡议，并且相信这一倡议必将对进一步和缓国际紧张局势发生有利影响。
    但是，同苏联不懈地争取普遍裁军的努力相反，美国统治集团却始终坚持扩军备战，千方百计地阻挠就裁军问题达成协议。就以最近一个时期来说，美国政府公开宣布了随时恢复核武器试验，把下一财政年度的军事开支继续保持在和平时期的最高水平，加速发展火箭的制造和生产，并且积极扩大海外导弹基地。不仅如此，美国还在加速武装西德和加强已有的各种侵略性军事集团的同时，同日本签订了军事同盟条约，复活日本军国主义。这种情况，正如中苏友好同盟互助条约所预见的，威胁着远东各国人民的安全和亚洲的和平。这一切彻底暴露了美国统治集团标榜的和平是假的，借和平之名，行备战之实，一切爱好和平的人民必须对此提高警惕。
    中华人民共和国一贯奉行和平政策，为了促进普遍裁军，从不吝惜作出自己可能作出的努力。尽管美国拒绝了朝中方面提出的从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队的合理建议，中国人民志愿军在1958年仍然主动地撤出了朝鲜。尽管美国军队还占领着我国领土台湾，美国的军事基地包围着半个中国，美国的海空军不断侵犯中国的领海和领空，中国从1951年起，仍然连续采取了一系列措施，大量裁减了自己的武装部队。中国的这些巨大努力，赢得了所有爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持。
    裁军问题是当前维护世界和平的一个重要的问题。全国人民代表大会常务委员会欢迎有关各国就普遍裁军问题迅速达成协议。中国一贯赞成普遍裁军，并且将毫不犹豫地承担起它同意承担的国际义务。但是，必须指出，如果没有中华人民共和国的正式参加和它的代表的签字，有关裁军的国际协议当然不能对中国具有任何约束力。现在，不管帝国主义对裁军的阻挠和破坏，世界人民要求普遍裁军的声势越来越壮大了。中国人民将同苏联和一切爱好和平的国家和人民一道，为实现全面、彻底的裁军，为争取持久和平，进行坚持不懈的奋斗。
