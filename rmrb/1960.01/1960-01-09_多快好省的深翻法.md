Editor's Note:

　　The strip-ridge deep plowing method created by Siyang County is a method for deep plowing that is more, faster, better, and more economical. This is a specific application of the General Line in the deep plowing movement.

　　The strip-ridge deep plowing method not only saves a significant amount of labor and animal power, ensuring that all spring-sown fields can be deep plowed in a timely manner, but also improves the quality of deep plowing, ensuring that the soil layers are not disrupted after deep plowing and that fertilizers can be used in a concentrated manner. Furthermore, by deep plowing according to different crop row spacing, it also promotes the overall planning and layout of crops. In short, this is a good method that achieves multiple benefits at once.

　　From this, we see the great power of creativity and that, under the guidance of the Party's General Line, as long as a correct method is found, all tasks can achieve the effect of being more, faster, better, and more economical.

    多快好省的深翻法
    泗阳县创造的条垅深翻法，是一个多快好省的深翻法。这是总路线在深翻运动中的具体运用。
    条垅深翻法，不但节省了大量的人工畜力，保证所有春播田能及时深翻一遍，而且还提高了深翻质量，做到了深翻后土层不乱，肥料能够集中使用；也由于按不同作物行距进行深翻，还推动了整个作物的规划布局。总之，这是一项一举数得的好办法。
    从这里，我们看到了创造性的伟大力量，看到了在党的总路线的指引下，只要找到一个正确的方法，各项工作就可以收到多快好省之效。
