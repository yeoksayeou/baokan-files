    Vietnam Achieved Remarkable Results in Literary and Artistic Work Last Year
    In 1959, literary and artistic work in North Vietnam achieved remarkable results. There has been great development in film and performing arts troupes. In 1959, eighty films were produced. "Both Banks of the Border Sea River," the first domestic feature film in Vietnamese film history, was filmed last year and was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people. The documentary "Bac Hung Hai," which introduced water conservancy project construction, won a gold medal at the 1959 International Film Festival in Moscow. At present, there are 198 cinemas and projection teams throughout North Vietnam. In 1955, there was an average of one projection unit for every seven or more counties. Now, there is an average of one projection unit for every county.
    In 1959, there were 34 performing arts troupes in North Vietnam. Some mountainous areas in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region and the Thai-Meo Autonomous Region also established their own performing arts troupes. They regularly cooperated with various political movements, went deep into various places to perform for the broad masses of people, and created many new scripts reflecting actual life.
    Vietnam's music and art achieved new accomplishments in 1959. The first symphony orchestra and the Central Acrobatic Troupe in history were established successively. The schools for training literary and artistic cadres have developed into five. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    越南去年文艺工作成绩显著
    1959年越南北方的文艺工作获得了显著成绩。电影和文工团的工作有很大发展。1959年生产了八十部影片，去年摄制的越南电影史上第一部国产故事片
  “边海河两岸”，受到广大人民热烈的欢迎。介绍水利工程建设的纪录片“北兴海”，获得1959年在莫斯科举行的国际电影节的金质奖章。目前，全北方已有一百九十八个电影院和放映队，1955年平均每七个多县才有一个放映单位，现在平均一个多县就有一个放映单位。
    1959年越南北方已有三十四个文工团，越北自治区和傣苗自治区的一些山区，也建立起了自己的文工团。它们经常配合各种政治运动深入各地为广大人民演出，并且创作了许多反映实际生活的新剧本。
    越南的音乐、艺术在1959年取得了新成就。历史上第一个交响乐队和中央杂技团相继成立。培养文艺干部的学校已经发展为五所。（据新华社讯）
