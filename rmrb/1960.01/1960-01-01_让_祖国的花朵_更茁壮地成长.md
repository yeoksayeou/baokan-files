Let the "Flowers of the Motherland" Grow Stronger
　　Zhang Yonghui, Director of the Chongqing Changjiang Electric Factory Nursery

These days, every time I hear the triumphant sound of gongs and drums, every time I open the newspaper and see the inspiring good news, my heart cannot be calm. In this vibrant garden of the motherland, where a hundred flowers are blooming, our small flower, the Changjiang Electric Factory Nursery, is also growing stronger and blooming more brightly under the cultivation of the Party.

Over the past year, our nursery has grown from the original nine childcare units to one hundred and forty-eight, with the number of children enrolled increasing three and a half times to more than two thousand. We have nurseries, childcare stations, childcare groups, and children's teams, as well as breastfeeding rooms. We have also built a toy manufacturing factory, a zoo, and ten children's farms. We have developed from a small, scattered nursery into a complete large-scale childcare network distributed throughout the factory area.

At the end of 1958, we only had more than six hundred children and forty-odd childcare workers. To meet the needs of the factory's employees, we had to expand; however, we lacked manpower, housing, and furniture. As soon as the Great Leap Forward began, the factory Party committee issued a call, requiring all factory employees to run nurseries. The next day, everyone offered houses and furniture, and applications to work as childcare workers poured into the Party branch offices like snowflakes. Our nursery was filled with the sound of gongs and drums all day long. In three days, everyone vacated more than two thousand square meters of housing, and in seven days, more than three thousand pieces of furniture and toys were delivered, piling up in the yard like a small mountain. Mothers, one by one, led their jumping and bouncing children, holding their nursing babies, and registered with us with smiling faces, asking for their children to be admitted. More than two hundred and sixty housewives who had just become childcare workers, wearing new clothes, led the children to sing and play games all day long with smiling faces. They didn't understand the work, didn't understand nursing, so they worked during the day and studied at night. If they had no education and couldn't sing, they learned and taught at the same time. Their enthusiasm was truly great. At that time, the office was extremely lively every night. The big room was packed, some learning to sing, some learning to play the accordion, some learning to read, and some learning to dance, every day like this, making noise until twelve o'clock at night and still not dispersing. Some childcare workers couldn't speak Mandarin and were extremely worried. In the hot weather, when others went to rest at noon, they pulled comrades who could speak Mandarin to learn sentence by sentence like children reciting books. They wrote down particularly difficult words on square pieces of paper and took them out to memorize whenever they had time. Even now, they are still "in class" every day at noon!

Now, in our factory area, you can no longer see children with runny noses crawling all over the ground, everyone is clean, jumping and singing all day long, and you can hear the tender voices of children singing everywhere. Old people all say: "Children these days are really blessed!" A female worker named Long Sufang, at first, when she sent her eldest child to our nursery, always felt that it wasn't as good as at home, and was afraid that the nanny would spoil them. For more than two months, because the flu was rampant outside, we banned leave, and she hadn't seen her child for a long time and was always worried. One day, she quietly broke a small hole in the fence and stood outside, watching and watching, and finally saw her eldest child running out of the classroom, dressed cleanly, growing chubby, and more energetic than at home; she really couldn't believe her eyes. Later, when she took him home and weighed him, he had gained more than four pounds. After that, she told everyone how good the nursery was and persuaded people to send their children there too.

In 1960, we will vigorously promote educational reform, vigorously improve educational methods, improve educational quality, and do a good job in children's disease prevention and healthcare, and always maintain the glorious title of disease-free nursery. At the same time, we must vigorously engage in sideline production, raise another forty pigs, two hundred poultry, and grow fifteen thousand catties of vegetables, so that the children can eat their fill and ensure they grow up plump and sturdy.

    让“祖国的花朵”更茁壮地成长
    重庆长江电工厂托儿所所长　张永慧
    这几天，每当我听到那一声声报捷的锣鼓，每当我翻开报纸，看到那一个个鼓舞人心的喜讯，我的心总是不能平静。在这万紫千红，百花竞艳的祖国大花园里，我们长江电工厂托儿所这朵小花，在党的培植下，也越来越茁壮，越开越鲜艳了。
    一年来，我们托儿所由原来九个托儿单位，增加到一百四十八个，入托儿童比原来增加三倍半，达到二千多人，我们有托儿所、托儿站、托儿组和娃娃队，还有哺乳室，我们还建成了一个玩具制造工厂，一个动物园和十个儿童农场，我们已经由原来规模很小的、分散的托儿所，发展成为一整套大型的分布在整个厂区的托儿网了。
    1958年底，我们只有六百多儿童，四十多个保育员。要适应厂里职工的需要，就得扩大；然而缺乏人力，缺少房子，没有家具。大跃进一来，厂党委一声号召，要求全厂职工办托儿所。第二天，大家让房子的让房子，送家具的送家具，要求作保育员的申请书雪片一般送到了各党支部办公室，我们所里一天到晚锣鼓喧天。三天，大家就腾出了两千多平方米房子，七天，送来的三千多件家具、玩具就堆了满满一院子，像座小山。妈妈们一个个牵着跳跳蹦蹦的孩子，抱着吃奶的娃娃，笑逐颜开的找我们登记，要求孩子入托。二百六十多个刚作保育员的家庭妇女，穿着新衣，成天笑迷迷地引着娃娃唱歌，做游戏。她们不懂业务，不懂护理，就白天工作，晚上学习，没有文化，不会唱歌，就边学边教。那干劲可真大得很。那时候，一到晚上，办公室里真热闹极了。大屋子挤得满满的，有的学歌，有的学风琴，有的学文化，有的学跳舞，天天这样，每晚闹到十二点还不散。有些保育员不会普通话，愁得不得了。大热天，人家中午都休息去了，她们还拉着会说普通话的同志，像娃娃们念书样一句句学，特别难记的字，就用方块纸写下来，有空就摸出来背，直到如今，她们每天中午还在“上课”咧！
    现在，在我们厂区，再也看不到流着鼻涕满地爬的娃娃，一个个都干干净净的，成天跳呀，唱呀，到处都听得到嫩声嫩气的歌声。老年人都说：“现在的娃娃真享福呀！”有个叫龙素芳的女工，开初她把大娃子送到我们托儿所，总觉得没有家里好，怕阿姨给带坏了。有两个多月因为外头流行性感冒闹得凶，我们禁假，她好久没看到娃娃，总放心不下。有天她悄悄把篱笆墙扒了个小洞，站在外面，看呀，看呀，终于看到大娃子从教室里跑出来了，穿得干干净净，长得胖嘟嘟的，比在家里有精神得多；她真有点不相信自己的眼睛，后来接到家里一称，体重足足增加四斤多。这以后，她逢人便讲托儿所如何如何好，劝人家把娃娃也送去。
    1960年，我们要大闹教养革新，大力改进教养方法，提高教养质量，并且要搞好儿童防保工作，永远保持无病托儿所的光荣称号。同时，还要大搞副业生产，再养四十头猪，二百只家禽，种一万五千斤菜，使儿童吃饱吃好，保证长得胖登登的。
