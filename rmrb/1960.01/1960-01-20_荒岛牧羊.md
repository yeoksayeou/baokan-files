Shepherding on a Desert Island
    Wu Xianmin

    Nail Head Mountain, this small island, is less than thirty meters above sea level and only half a li in circumference. Just over a year ago, it was a desolate island, covered with brownish-yellow rocks, with only sparse weeds growing on the hilltop. People described it as: "No drop of water when it's dry, washed away like mud when it floods, waves engulf the mountain in storms, and birds' nests fly away in the wind." Now, it is full of sheep running around like snowballs.

    It turns out that to the north of this small island, there is another small island. A People's Liberation Army unit is stationed on that island. In the past, the soldiers here had to transport vegetables and meat from the mainland. It was far from the mainland, taking two full days to travel back and forth. This area is known for its high winds and big waves, and if the weather was slightly bad, the boat couldn't travel, so the soldiers had to eat plain meals. Last spring, the soldiers decided to produce their own vegetables, no longer relying on state supply. Soon, patches of fresh green vegetables grew. Not long after, the quartermaster bought nine sheep to raise. When the sheep arrived on the island, they ate the vegetables everywhere, and some people saw them and chased and beat them. Cook Xiao Guo felt very sorry, "Don't hit them! Now even the smallest piece of land has been planted with pumpkins and eggplants, and there's no grass left for the sheep to eat, so can you blame them?"

    "Where have you ever seen sheep grazing in a vegetable garden?" Xiao Guo lay in bed, pondering. "That's right, move the sheep to Nail Head Mountain across the way!" At the time, some people didn't agree: "That won't work! It's as bare as a bald head, are you going to have the sheep gnaw on rocks?" Xiao Guo replied, "If we lack grass, we'll plant it. If we lack water, we'll dig a pond. As long as we're willing to work, what's there to worry about!"

    Since the sheep were moved to Nail Head Mountain, Xiao Guo and the cooks have been extremely busy. Whenever they had some free time between dawn and dusk, they would row a sampan to check on the sheep. Digging water ponds, sowing grass, building sheep pens... Xiao Guo often touched his face, as if he himself was also getting fat along with the sheep. Once, he and cook A Jin went to Nail Head Mountain and discovered that two ewes were pregnant. He said to A Jin with a smile, "In another month or so, we'll have a few more sheep!" A Jin said, "If there are more sheep, I think I'll have to organize them into squads and elect you as the sheep squad leader!"

    Winter arrived. One day, Xiao Guo was about to go out to fetch firewood when he looked up and saw dark clouds gathering on the edge of the sea, rushing towards the island, and a few seagulls were flying low over the surface of the sea. A storm was about to strike. Xiao Guo suddenly remembered that these days were the lambing season, so he told the squad leader that he was going to Nail Head Mountain to check on the sheep. The squad leader said, "The storm is coming hard, you can't go!" Xiao Guo stamped his feet anxiously: "It's freezing and there's a storm, if something happens to the ewes, what are we going to rely on to expand production?" A Jin quickly said from the side, "Squad leader, don't worry, I'll go with Xiao Guo!" With that, the two ran down the hillside.

    The two jumped into the sampan and rowed hard towards Nail Head Mountain. Unfortunately, it was against the wind, and soon it started to rain. In the wind and rain, it took them a great deal of effort to row the sampan close to the island. As soon as they landed, they were surrounded by sheep, but the two ewes were nowhere to be seen. They searched separately. After a long time, Xiao Guo finally found the two ewes huddled in a rock crevice, shivering with cold. He called out to A Jin while hurriedly taking off his cotton coat, covering the ewes, and gently massaging their bellies. Night fell, and they were both tired, hungry, and cold. A Jin couldn't stand it any longer: "This is really hell, if we keep freezing like this, we'll grow fur all over our bodies!" His words reminded Xiao Guo, who said, "Oh! Why are we just keeping so much wool clothing here and not wearing it!" As he spoke, he pulled two sheep close to his side. In this way, they huddled together with the sheep, resisting the cold wind and rain, and spent the night...

    At dawn, the wind stopped and the rain ceased. As the red sun emerged from the sea, the two ewes were panting heavily, ready to give birth. Xiao Guo and A Jin stared intently as the lambs were born one by one: one, two, three, until the last lamb was born, they shouted with joy: "Six! Six!"

    When they finished delivering the tenth lamb in the sheep pen, A Jin excitedly said to Xiao Guo, "Today our sheep are exactly one hundred and twenty, just enough for a team, it's time to promote you to sheep team leader, let's sing a folk song to celebrate!"

    Xiao Guo stroked a white, fat sheep and sang: "Baa baa sheep, sheep baa baa, the sheep are treated like calves. One becomes ten, ten becomes a hundred, the shepherd's heart is happy!"

    Now, the soldiers not only eat fat mutton every few days, but also occasionally load three or five heads and send them to the mainland, so that the people there can taste the flavor of "sea sheep." Nail Head Mountain has also been renamed "Sheep Island."

    荒岛牧羊
    吴献民
    钉头山这个小岛，海拔不到三十米，方圆也只有半里多。一年多以前，它是座荒凉的孤岛，岛上到处是褐黄色的岩石，只是在山顶上稀稀疏疏地长着些杂草。人们形容它说：“旱来无滴水，涝来洗泥丸，浪大翻山过，鸟窠随风转。”现在，它却到处有雪团似的羊儿在奔跑了。
    原来，这个小岛的北面，还有座小岛。这个岛驻着一支解放军部队。过去，这里的战士吃菜吃肉都得到大陆去运。这儿离大陆远，来去要整整两天。这一带风高浪大，天气稍为不好，船就不能走，战士们只好瞪着眼睛吃淡饭。去年春天，战士们决定自己生产蔬菜，不再靠国家供应。不久，一片片青鲜的蔬菜长了出来，不久，事务长又买来了九只羊饲养。羊一到岛上到处吃青菜，有人看到就赶羊打羊。炊事员小郭很心痛，“别打啊，如今连铜钱大的地也栽上了南瓜、茄子，没留点点草给羊吃，这能怪羊吗？”
    “哪里有在青菜地放羊的呢？”小郭躺在床上苦苦地思索着。“对，把羊放到对面钉头山上去！”当时有人不赞成：“不行！那里光得像个癞痢头，叫羊啃石头去？”小郭回答说：“缺草咱们种，缺水咱挖池，只要肯干，愁什么！”
    自从羊儿移到钉头山，可把小郭和炊事员们忙坏了。破晓落晚有点空，他们就划着舢板去看羊。挖水池，播草，筑羊圈……。小郭时常摸摸自己的脸蛋，好像自己也跟着羊儿飞快地胖起来了。一次，他和炊事员阿金上钉头山，发现两头母羊有胎了。他笑眯眯地对阿金说：“再有个把月，又要添几只羊啦！”阿金说：“羊多了，我看得编编班，选你当羊班长吧！”
    入冬了。一天，小郭正要出去背柴，抬头一望，大海边上墨黑的乌云正向岛上扑来，几只海鸥贴着海面低飞，一场风暴转眼就要袭来。小郭猛地想起这几日正是母羊下羔的时节，就告诉班长要去钉头山看羊。班长说：“风暴来势凶，去不得！”小郭急得直跺脚：“大冷天加风暴，母羊出了事，指望什么扩大生产？”阿金在旁边忙说：“班长放心，我和小郭一块去！”说罢，两人就奔下了山坡。
    两人跳上舢板，使劲向钉头山划去。偏偏是顶风，不久，又下起雨来。在风雨中，他俩费了九牛二虎之力才把舢板划近岛子。他俩一上岸就被羊儿包围起来，唯独两只母羊不见了。他俩分头去找。好半天，小郭才发现两只母羊蜷缩在岩弄里，冻得正打颤。他一面叫阿金，一面忙把棉衣脱下来，盖在母羊身上，又替它在肚子上轻轻地按摩。入夜了，他俩又累、又饿、又冷。阿金耐不住了：“真见鬼，这样冻下去身上非长毛不可！”一句话点醒了小郭，他说：“哎呀！这么多的羊毛衣干吗摆着不穿呀！”说着拉过两只羊紧靠在身边。就这样，他们和羊挤在一团，抗御着寒风冷雨，度了一夜……。
    拂晓，风停雨止。当红艳艳的太阳浮出海面时，两头母羊急促地喘息着，要下羔了。小郭和阿金紧张地瞪着眼睛看着小羊一头头地落地：一只、两只、三只，直到最后一只小羊生下时，他俩高兴地喊叫开来：“六只！六只！”
    当他们在羊圈里第十次接生完了小羊时，阿金兴冲冲地对小郭说：“今天咱们的羊刚好满一百二十只，正好一个队，该升你当羊队长了，来唱个山歌贺一贺！”
    小郭抚摸着一只白白的肥羊，唱了起来：“咩咩羊，羊咩咩，羊儿当做牯儿赶。一成十，十成百，牧羊人心里舒坦坦！”
    现在，战士们不仅三天两头能吃上肥羊肉，还不时载上三五头到大陆去，让那里的人们尝尝“海羊”的滋味。钉头山，也已更名叫“羊岛”了。
