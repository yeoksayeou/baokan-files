Xinhua News Agency, 4th, Kathmandu: Nepalese government leaders have stated that Nepal does not believe China will invade its neighbors and hopes the Sino-Indian border issue will be resolved peacefully.

Nepalese Minister of Interior and Justice, Upreti, said when meeting with reporters on December 31, 1959, that the Nepalese government is well aware of the situation on the Nepalese border. He said, "As far as we know, our borders in the south and north are very safe, and we don't have to worry about aggression from any side. We are confident in the best friendship with our neighbors." "We have complete trust in our neighbors."

Upreti said that India and China are currently working to resolve their disputes, and people should hope for a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Indian dispute. He said, "It is reasonable for Nepal to hope that border disputes will be resolved early through goodwill and understanding."

According to a report in Nepal's "Ideal Newspaper" on December 29, Upreti, in a conversation with the newspaper's reporter, denied the rumors about "Chinese troops in Nepal."

On the same day, Upreti told the Nepalese press that Nepal's policy is one of active neutrality. He believed that when both India and China are exploring the possibility of resolving the dispute, it is inappropriate for someone in Nepal to express support for the opinion that the McMahon Line is the border between India and China.

He also said: "There will be no war between India and China." "Creating non-existent fears among the public is against the national interest." He expressed regret over the fact that some people are trying to make unfounded criticisms of some of Nepal's friendly neighbors, thereby creating suspicion and discord among the people.

Prior to this, according to a report in the British "Daily Telegraph" on December 8, 1959, Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala told the newspaper's special correspondent in Kathmandu, "I don't think China really wants to invade us or India." He also said, "I really feel that we are not in danger of being invaded by China." On November 29 of last year, he also denied that China had "violated" Nepalese territory and airspace.

Koirala said at a public gathering on December 5, 1959, that Nepal hopes that the dispute between China and India will be resolved peacefully. He said that Nepal is friendly to both India and China.

Nepalese Deputy Prime Minister Shamsher also denied any actions by Chinese troops to violate the Nepalese border in Calcutta on November 6, 1959. He hoped that relations between India and China would improve. He said that India and China are friendly neighbors, and he hoped that the territorial disputes between China and India would be resolved peacefully. He said: "The Bandung spirit is very precious in the hearts of everyone in Asia and Africa, and maintaining this spirit is what these countries are concerned about."

Nepalese Minister of Rural Development Giri, who had attended the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, said when he returned to Kathmandu from Beijing on October 22 of last year that China "is willing to peacefully resolve its disputes with India in a friendly manner."

He said that as a friendly country, Nepal is eager for the border dispute between India and China to be resolved amicably. He also said when passing through Hong Kong that he was convinced that China was upholding the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd, Calcutta: Bhutanese Prime Minister Dorji said in Calcutta on the 23rd of last month that the situation on the border between Bhutan and China is "extremely normal and peaceful."

Dorji said, "The reports about Chinese troops gathering on our border are completely without factual basis."

    尼泊尔政府领导人表示
    不存在所谓中国侵略的危险
    不丹首相指出不丹中国边境局势正常
    新华社4日讯　加德满都消息：尼泊尔政府领导人表示，尼泊尔不认为中国会侵略它的邻国，并且希望中印边界问题得到和平解决。
    尼泊尔内政和司法大臣乌帕德亚亚在1959年12月31日接见记者时说，尼泊尔政府对尼泊尔边境局势了解得很清楚。他说，“据我们所知，我们南部和北部的边境都很安全，我们不必担心任何一面会有侵略。我们确信我们同邻国的最好的友谊。”“我们完全信任我们的邻国”。
    乌帕德亚亚说，目前印度和中国之间正在努力解决它们的争端，人们要希望和平解决中印争端。他说，“尼泊尔希望通过善意和谅解来及早解决边境纠纷……是有道理的”。
    据12月29日尼泊尔“理想报”报道，乌帕德亚亚对这家报纸的记者发表谈话时，否认了关于“尼泊尔境内有中国军队”的谣言。
    同一天，乌帕德亚亚向尼泊尔报界发表谈话说，尼泊尔的政策是一个积极中立的政策。他认为当印度和中国都正在探求解决这一争端的可能性的时候，尼泊尔有人表示支持麦克马洪线是印度和中国之间的边界的意见，是不适当的。
    他又说：“印度和中国之间不会有战争。”“在公众中制造不存在的恐惧是违反民族利益的”。他对有人努力对尼泊尔的一些友好邻国进行没有根据的批评、从而在人民中制造猜疑和不和这件事，表示遗憾。
    在此以前，据英国“每日电讯报”1959年12月8日报道，尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊对这家报纸驻加德满都的特派记者说，“我认为中国并不真正想侵略我们或者印度”。他还说，“我真正感到，我们并没有处于遭到中国侵略的危险中”。他在去年11月29日并且否认中国“侵犯”过尼泊尔的领土和领空。
    柯伊拉腊在1959年12月5日在一次公众集会上说，尼泊尔希望中印两国之间的纠纷获得和平解决。他说，尼泊尔对印度和中国都是友好的。
    尼泊尔副首相沙姆谢尔1959年11月6日在加尔各答也否认中国军队有任何侵犯尼泊尔边界的行动。他希望印度和中国关系将得到改善。他说，印度和中国是有着友好关系的邻邦，他希望，中印两国间的领土纠纷将和平地得到解决。他说：“万隆精神在亚非每个人的心目中都是非常珍贵的，保持这种精神是这些国家所关心的事情。”
    曾经参加中华人民共和国建国十周年庆祝典礼的尼泊尔乡村发展大臣吉里在去年10月22日从北京回到加德满都的时候说，中国“愿意以友好的方式同印度和平解决它们之间的纠纷”。
    他说，作为一个友好的国家，尼泊尔渴望印度和中国的边界纠纷能够得到和好的解决。他在路过香港的时候还说，他确信中国在维护五项和平共处原则。
    新华社3日讯　加尔各答消息：不丹首相多尔吉上月23日在加尔各答说，不丹和中国边境上的局势“极其正常和和平”。
    多尔吉说，“关于中国军队在我们边境上集结的报道是毫无事实根据的。”
