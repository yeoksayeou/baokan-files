　　The Radiance of Mao Zedong Thought
　　Commemorating the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Publication of "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire"

　　A Typical Example of Revolutionary Creativity

　　In his article "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," Comrade Mao Zedong further elaborated on the creative revolutionary theory of establishing rural revolutionary base areas and encircling the cities from the countryside. This is a classic contribution of Comrade Mao Zedong in combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. Prior to this, proletarian revolutions in various countries always began with armed uprisings in the cities. The Paris Commune of 1871 was such an example. The great Russian October Revolution was also such an example. These suited the actual revolutionary conditions of those countries and were great examples. However, in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country like China, after the failure of the First Domestic Revolutionary War, Comrade Mao Zedong flexibly applied the general principles of Marxism-Leninism, specifically analyzed China's political and economic situation, and specifically analyzed the changes in the Chinese revolutionary situation and class relations. He believed that the focus of the Chinese revolution must shift from the cities to the countryside, establishing rural revolutionary base areas, implementing the policy of encircling the cities from the countryside and advancing towards the whole country in a wave-like manner, pointing out that this "is the highest form of peasant struggle under the leadership of the proletariat in semi-colonial China." In this way, the armed countryside could encircle and ultimately seize the cities occupied by the counter-revolutionaries, achieving national victory. The victorious road of the Chinese revolution became another great example for the proletariat to carry out revolutionary struggles. In guiding the practice of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, Comrade Mao Zedong creatively enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism with new principles. This is an important contribution of Comrade Mao Zedong to Marxism-Leninism.

　　The Victory of the Class Analysis Method

　　Comrade Mao Zedong's great work, "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," in comprehensively observing various contradictions, first grasped the class contradiction, thereby concluding that a revolutionary upsurge against imperialism, warlords, and landlords was inevitable in China's seemingly never-ending predicament.

　　In class society, class contradiction is the main and most essential contradiction. Comrade Mao Zedong precisely used the "class analysis method," this sharpest weapon, to expose and expound the true situation of Chinese society.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong also told us, "If there are many contradictions in any process, one of them must be the principal one, playing the leading and decisive role, while the others occupy a secondary and subordinate position." ("On Contradiction") Comrade Mao Zedong is an example of applying this method. Among the many contradictions at that time, what was the main contradiction? This was the contradiction between the broad masses of the people and imperialism and feudalism. Many other contradictions were derived from this main contradiction and would be resolved with the resolution of this contradiction. The history of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the Anti-Japanese War, and the subsequent Third Domestic Revolutionary War clearly proved this conclusion.

　　Now, in our country, although contradictions among the people are manifested in large numbers, class contradictions still exist. Our task is to learn Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the class viewpoint, use the dialectical method, grasp the main contradictions, resolve contradictions one by one, and accelerate socialist construction.
　　(Excerpt from "The Flames of Revolution Burn Brighter" by Zhang Xiangling, published in the first issue of "Struggle" in Heilongjiang, 1960)

　　A Model of Scientific Prediction

　　Comrade Mao Zedong's work, "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," was written at a time when the enemy was still very strong and the revolutionary forces were relatively weak, when "the sky seemed dark." From this, we can see Comrade Mao Zedong's great revolutionary courage and amazing ability to foresee the course of events. Lenin said, "Miraculous prophecies are fairy tales, scientific prophecies are facts." The facts of the historical development of the Chinese revolution rapidly and completely confirmed Comrade Mao Zedong's scientific predictions.

　　The outstanding contribution of Comrade Mao Zedong's work is not only that he comprehensively and objectively analyzed the situation at that time, pointing out that a revolutionary upsurge was about to arrive, thus arming the entire party ideologically and theoretically. It also prescribed the direction and tactics of the struggle to promote the arrival of the revolutionary upsurge. The role played by Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on establishing revolutionary base areas, as expounded here and in other works, in the Chinese revolution cannot be overestimated. It is inconceivable that without the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's above-mentioned thought, there could have been the development of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the revolutionary base areas, and the complete victory of the Chinese revolution.

　　From this work and other works written by Comrade Mao Zedong in the early days of the Chinese revolution, we can see that Comrade Mao Zedong was already skillfully applying the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to solve the problems of the Chinese revolution at that time. His instructions, policies, and strategies for the Chinese revolution based on the situation at that time are models of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution.

　　Revisiting this work allows us to deeply understand: the revolutionary forces representing the new relations of production overcoming the decadent forces representing the old relations of production, and socialism replacing capitalism, are the inevitable laws of the development of human society. All new and revolutionary forces representing the direction of historical progress, although at one time only a single spark, will eventually become a prairie fire; and all decadent and reactionary forces, although at one time seeming like a raging fire, will eventually tend to extinguish.
　　(Excerpt from "A Model of Scientific Prediction" by Liu Quankai, published in the People's Liberation Army Daily on January 4)

　　A Model of Dauntless Revolutionary Courage

　　The article "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" demonstrates Comrade Mao Zedong's great revolutionary spirit and abundant revolutionary optimism. Despising the enemy strategically and taking the enemy seriously tactically is Comrade Mao Zedong's consistent thought. These ideas of Comrade Mao Zedong are based on a scientific communist worldview and an unwavering proletarian stance. In the eyes of communists, communism is the greatest and most magnificent revolutionary cause, the most ideal and perfect society for mankind. Communists who fight for the cause of communism are never afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice. No matter how difficult, critical, or dangerous the revolutionary situation is, they are always full of revolutionary optimism, with the greatest courage and arduous struggle, without retreating, to overcome difficulties, transform the environment, and persevere in the revolution to the end. Comrade Mao Zedong centrally represents this noble quality of communists. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote the article "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" at a time when the revolution was in an extremely difficult and dangerous era. However, Comrade Mao Zedong, with dauntless revolutionary courage, held high the red flag, marched to Jinggangshan, established base areas, and launched land revolution struggles, demonstrating a high degree of leadership art, using revolutionary offense to cover revolutionary retreat, and skillfully combining revolutionary retreat and revolutionary offense. Moreover, he firmly believed that the revolution would surely be victorious and foresaw that the revolutionary upsurge would inevitably come soon. It was precisely because Comrade Mao Zedong discerned the inevitability of revolutionary development and grasped the decisive factors promoting the revolutionary upsurge that he not only guided the revolution with a firm revolutionary will, but also educated and infected comrades with a scientific analysis of objective things, a dauntless revolutionary spirit, and optimism to overcome the pessimistic ideological sentiments at that time. It is precisely because Comrade Mao Zedong consistently maintained full revolutionary enthusiasm, vigorous fighting spirit, and ever-youthful thought in leading the revolution that he always guided the revolution from one victory to another greater victory and continued to move forward.

### 光华四射的毛泽东思想  纪念“星星之火，可以燎原”一文发表三十周年

    光华四射的毛泽东思想
    纪念“星星之火，可以燎原”一文发表三十周年
    革命创造性的典型
    毛泽东同志在“星星之火，可以燎原”这篇文章中，进一步发挥了建立农村革命根据地、以农村包围城市这一创造性的革命理论问题。这是毛泽东同志以马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合的一个典范的贡献。在这以前，各国的无产阶级革命总是从城市武装起义开始的。1871年的巴黎公社是这样。伟大的俄国十月革命也是这样。这是适合这些国家的革命实际情况的，是一些伟大的典型。但是，在中国这样一个半殖民地半封建的国家，当第一次国内革命战争失败以后，毛泽东同志灵活地运用马克思列宁主义的一般原理，具体地分析了我国的政治经济情况，具体地分析了中国革命形势和阶级关系的变化，认为中国革命的重心必须由城市转向农村，建立农村革命根据地，执行以农村包围城市，向全国作波浪式推进的方针，指出这“是半殖民地中国在无产阶级领导之下的农民斗争的最高形式”。这样，就可以以武装的农村包围并且最后夺取反革命占据的城市，取得全国的胜利。中国革命的胜利道路成了无产阶级进行革命斗争的另一种伟大的典型。毛泽东同志在指导中国革命斗争实践中，创造性地以新的原理丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义，这是毛泽东同志对于马克思列宁主义的一个重要贡献，
    （摘自1月6日中国青年报久华、成于集：“科学的预见伟大的胆略”）
    阶级分析方法的胜利
    毛泽东同志的“星星之火，可以燎原”这一伟大著作在全面地观察各种矛盾中，首先抓住了阶级矛盾，由此得出结论：中国在皇皇不可终日的局面之下，反帝反军阀反地主的革命高潮不可避免。
    在阶级社会中，阶级的矛盾是主要的最本质的矛盾。毛泽东同志正是运用“阶级分析方法”这一最锐利的武器，去揭露和阐述中国社会真实情况的。
    毛泽东同志还告诉我们，“任何过程如果有多数矛盾存在的话，其中必定有一种是主要的，起着领导的、决定的作用，其他则处于次要和服从的地位。”（“矛盾论”）毛泽东同志就是运用这一方法的典范。当时的许多矛盾中，什么是主要矛盾呢？这就是广大人民群众同帝国主义和封建主义的矛盾。其他的许多矛盾，正是由这一主要矛盾所派生的，将随着这个矛盾的解决而解决。第二次国内革命战争和抗日战争，及其以后的第三次国内革命战争的历史，完全清楚的证明了这一论断。
    现在，在我国，虽然人民内部矛盾表现为大量的。但是阶级矛盾依然存在。我们的任务就是要学习毛泽东思想，坚持阶级观点，运用辩证的方法，抓住主要矛盾，逐个的解决矛盾，加速社会主义建设。
      （摘自黑龙江“奋斗”一九六零年第一期，张向凌：“革命烈火越烧越旺”）
    科学预见的范例
    毛泽东同志的“星星之火，可以燎原”这篇著作，是在敌人还很强大，革命力量比较弱小，“天空似乎一片黑暗”的时期里写出的。从这里可以看到毛泽东同志伟大的革命胆略，预见事变进程的惊人才能。列宁说：“神奇的预言是童话，科学的预言是事实。”中国革命历史发展的事实，迅速地全部地证实了毛泽东同志科学的预言。
    毛泽东同志这一著作的杰出贡献，不仅是他全面而客观地分析了当时的形势，指出革命高潮行将到来，因而从思想上、理论上武装了全党。而且为促进革命高潮的到来，规定了斗争的方针和策略。毛泽东同志在这里和其他著作中所阐明的建立革命根据地的思想，在中国革命所发生的作用是无论怎样估计也不会过高的。不能设想，离开了毛泽东同志以上的思想指导，而能有工农红军、革命根据地的发展，而能有中国革命的全部胜利。
    从这一著作和毛泽东同志在中国革命初期写的其他著作中，我们可以看出，毛泽东同志在当时就熟练地运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理来解决中国革命问题了。他根据当时形势，对中国革命所作的指示，制订的方针、政策，就是马克思列宁主义和中国革命实践结合的典范。
    重温这一著作，使我们可以深刻地领会：代表新的生产关系的革命力量战胜代表旧的生产关系的腐朽势力，社会主义代替资本主义，是人类社会发展的必然规律。一切代表历史前进方向的新生的、革命的力量，虽然一时还是星星之火，但最终必然成为燎原的大火；而一切腐朽的、反动的力量，虽然一时看来是弥天大火，最终必将趋于熄灭。
    （摘自1月4日解放军报刘全开：“科学预见的典范”）
    大无畏的革命勇气的榜样
    “星星之火，可以燎原”这篇文章，显示了毛泽东同志极大的革命魄力和充沛的革命乐观主义精神。在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人，这是毛泽东同志的一贯思想。毛泽东同志的这些思想是建立在科学的共产主义世界观和坚定不移的无产阶级立场之上的。在共产党人看来，共产主义是最伟大最壮丽的革命事业，是人类最理想最美满的社会，为共产主义事业而奋斗的共产党人，从不怕流血牺牲，无论革命处于多么困难、危急、艰险的局面之下，总是充满革命的乐观主义精神，以最大的勇气、艰苦的斗争，毫不退缩地去克服困难，改造环境，坚持革命到底。毛泽东同志集中地代表了共产党人的这种高贵的品质。毛泽东同志写“星星之火，可以燎原”这篇文章时，正是革命处于极端困难、艰险的年代。然而，毛泽东同志却以大无畏的革命勇气，高举红旗，进军井岗山，创建根据地，开展土地革命斗争，表现了高度的领导艺术，以革命的进攻掩护革命的退却，把革命的退却和革命的进攻巧妙的结合起来。而且，坚信革命一定要胜利，预见革命的高潮必然快要到来。正是因为毛泽东同志洞察了革命发展的必然性，抓住了促进革命高潮的决定因素，所以他不但以坚定的革命意志去指导革命，而且，以对客观事物的科学分析、革命的大无畏精神和乐观主义来教育和感染同志，以克服当时的悲观思想情绪。正是因为毛泽东同志在领导革命中，一贯保持饱满的革命热情、旺盛不衰的斗志、永远青春的思想，所以总是把革命从一个胜利引导到另一个更大的胜利，而不断前进。
