    Striding Confidently into 1960
    Wang Pu
    The new year has begun. This new year will be a year of continued leap forward, and we will win better and more comprehensive victories. The workers of the Tianjin Dyeing and Weaving Factory declared this firm conviction with their own experiences and practical actions. Many other enterprise workers across the country have also declared the same conviction. Our working class is striding into 1960 with heroic steps and high spirits.
    Our confidence that a better and more comprehensive leap forward will inevitably be achieved in 1960 stems from the fact that the great leap forward of 1958 and the continued leap forward of 1959 have eloquently proved that the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and the entire set of "walking on two legs" policies, are completely correct. This General Line and the entire set of "walking on two legs" policies most concentratedly reflect the objective laws of socialist economic development and the desire and will of our people to rapidly change the "poor and blank" face of our country. Therefore, it can most fully mobilize the socialist enthusiasm and creativity of the 650 million people. It solves not individual problems in construction for us, but the most fundamental problem of building socialism at high speed. Therefore, it will not only play a role for one or two years, but will play a long-term role, and its role will become greater and greater. If we adhere to this General Line and the entire set of "walking on two legs" policies, there will not be a leap forward for only one or two years, but a continuous leap forward every year, and the leap forward will be better and more comprehensive year after year.
    Our confidence in the continued leap forward in 1960 does not mean that we will not encounter this or that specific difficulty on our road forward.
    The problems of raw materials, equipment, labor force, etc., so-called "failure to meet production needs," were encountered in the great leap forward of 1958, in the continued leap forward of 1959, and will inevitably be encountered in the continued leap forward of 1960. However, everything depends on human effort. What do these problems count for if we go all out? Didn't the Tianjin Dyeing and Weaving Factory also encounter these problems when it began to formulate this year's leap forward plan? After going all out, fully developing people's subjective initiative, and vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, weren't more than 260 of the more than 270 kinds of raw materials needed fully guaranteed? Hasn't the problem of labor shortage and equipment imbalance been solved or are there prospects for a solution? Production potential, as the workers said, is not like a cup of water, which becomes less and less as you drink it, but like a well, which is constantly flowing. The reason is very simple, because our workers' ideological awareness is improving day by day, and their production experience is becoming richer day by day. People's understanding of the laws of development of objective things is becoming more and more profound and comprehensive, so their ability to innovate and revolutionize technology is also becoming greater and greater, and the methods to overcome difficulties are also increasing. Some technical innovation projects that could not be imagined last year can be imagined this year; some things that could not be done last year can be done this year. Therefore, production potential has not been exhausted because of two consecutive years of leap forward, but has become greater because of two consecutive years of leap forward. Our confidence in the continued leap forward in 1960 is not because we have already leaped forward for two consecutive years and have no confidence, but because we have had two consecutive years of leap forward, and our confidence is even greater.
    The great leap forward of 1958 and the continued leap forward of 1959 laid the foundation for subsequent continuous leap forwards. 1960 is a certain new year of leap forward. We will always move forward with heroic steps and full of confidence.

    满怀信心跨进一九六零年
    王朴
    新的一年开始了。这新的一年，将是继续跃进的一年，我们将夺得更好更全面的胜利。天津市染织厂的职工，用他们切身的体验和实际行动，宣告了这个坚强的信念。全国许许多多企业的职工，也都宣告了同样的信念。我国工人阶级意气风发地迈着英雄的步伐跨进了1960年。
    我们对1960年必然实现更好更全面的跃进所以满怀信心，是因为1958年大跃进和1959年继续跃进的事实，雄辩地证明了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，是完全正确的。这条总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，最集中地反映了社会主义经济发展的客观规律和我国人民迅速改变“一穷二白”面貌的愿望和意志，所以它最能充分地调动六亿五千万人民建设社会主义的积极性和创造性。它给我们解决的不是建设中的个别问题，而是高速度建设社会主义的最根本的问题。所以，它不是只在一年两年内起作用，而是长期地起作用，而且作用会越来越大。坚持这条总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，就不会是一年两年的跃进，而是年年连续的跃进，而且会一年比一年跃进得更好更全面。
    我们对1960年继续跃进满怀信心，并不是说，在我们前进的道路上完全不会遇到这样那样的具体困难。
    原材料、设备、劳动力等等所谓“不能满足生产需要”的问题，在1958年的大跃进中遇到过，在1959年的继续跃进中遇到过，在1960年的继续跃进中也免不了。然而事在人为，鼓足了干劲，这些问题又算得什么呢？天津市染织厂在开始制定今年跃进计划的时候，不是也遇到这些问题吗？鼓足了干劲，充分发挥了人的主观能动作用，大闹技术革新和技术革命以后，所需要的二百七十多种原材料，不是二百六十多种都有了充分的保证吗？劳动力不足和设备不平衡问题，不是得到了解决或者可能有解决的眉目了吗？生产潜力，正像工人们讲的，不是一杯水，越喝越少，而是一口井，源源不断。原因很简单，因为我们工人的思想觉悟一天天提高，生产经验一天天丰富。人们对客观事物发展规律的认识，越来越深刻，越来越全面，因而技术革新和技术革命的本领也越来越大，克服困难的办法也越来越多。有些技术革新项目，在去年还想不到的，今年就想得到了；有些事情，在去年还办不到的，今年就办得到了。所以，生产潜力不是因为连续两年的跃进而挖尽了，而是因为连续两年的跃进而更多了，我们对1960年的继续跃进，不是因为已经连续跃进两年而没有信心，而是因为有了连续两年的跃进，而信心更足了。
    1958年的大跃进和1959年的继续跃进，给以后的连续的跃进奠定了基础。1960年是铁定的新跃进年。我们永远满怀信心地迈着英雄的步伐前进。
