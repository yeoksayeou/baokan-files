Xinhua News Agency, January 15th – North Korea's "Rodong Sinmun" stated today its warm support and welcome for the proposal made by Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev at the Supreme Soviet meeting on the 14th, regarding another unilateral reduction of the Soviet armed forces by 1.2 million troops within one to two years.

The newspaper said that the Korean people, along with peace-loving people all over the world, warmly welcome this proposal and are very grateful to the Soviet people for their consistent efforts to ease international tensions and for world peace.

The newspaper pointed out that this decisive step taken by the Soviet Union sets a brilliant example that Western countries should follow. If Western imperialists still try to cover up their sinister nature with empty talk, instead of following the Soviet example, they will inevitably suffer even more disastrous defeats.

Xinhua News Agency, January 15th – Vietnam's "Nhan Dan" published an editorial today, warmly welcoming the proposal made by Khrushchev to reduce the Soviet armed forces once again. The editorial pointed out that this proposal has very important significance in the current situation. When imperialist countries headed by the United States continue the arms race and strengthen military aggression groups, and when some warmongers in the United States constantly clamor for attacking the Soviet Union, people clearly see that the Soviet Union's action of reducing its armed forces by more than 1 million troops once again is a manifestation of the invincible strength of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp. The editorial said that the people of the world are deeply aware that the current improvement in the international situation is mainly due to the strength of the Soviet Union and its unremitting efforts for peace and cooperation among all nations.

Xinhua News Agency, January 15th – The report by Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev at the Supreme Soviet meeting has been warmly welcomed by the people of socialist countries.

Czechoslovakia's "Rude Pravo" published an editorial today saying that this unilateral step by the Soviet Union is not only warmly welcomed by the Soviet people and the socialist camp, but also warmly welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world. The newspaper emphasized that the reduction of armed forces "shows the great strength of the Soviet Union and the vigorous development of the entire socialist camp, and shows that the forces of peace clearly have the upper hand in the world." The newspaper condemned the policy of Adenauer and those in the United States who advocate the Cold War to sharpen international relations. The newspaper also said that it is obvious that this step by the Soviet government, which clearly demonstrates its peaceful intentions, will help create a good atmosphere for the summit meeting and promote disarmament negotiations.

A commentary in Poland's "Trybuna Ludu" pointed out that the proposal for unilateral disarmament by a powerful socialist country will undoubtedly be conducive to the continued relaxation of international tensions. The commentary went on to point out that only a powerful country that does not want to threaten anyone and has no aggressive intentions can make such a decision. Therefore, the people of Western countries will ask their governments the following questions: What is the obstacle to stopping the nuclear arms race? Why does the United States constantly put forward new conditions in Geneva that prevent an agreement from being reached on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests? The Soviet Union is reducing its troops, but why is the West still expanding its armed forces? The commentary concluded by pointing out that the Polish people warmly welcome the new and significant contribution made by the fraternal Soviet Union to the cause of disarmament, continued relaxation of international tensions, and strengthening peace.

Bulgaria's "Rabotnichesko Delo" said that the issue of disarmament is now the focus of all the most important issues of our time. If this issue is resolved as the Soviet Union suggests, international tensions and distrust between countries will disappear. The newspaper emphasized that the interests of the people of all countries require the governments of Western countries to follow the path taken by the Soviet government.

Xinhua News Agency, January 15th – The statement made by Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev at the Supreme Soviet meeting that the Soviet Union has decided to unilaterally reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million troops has received widespread attention from public opinion in Western countries, and many newspapers have welcomed this major Soviet measure to strive for peace.

The British "Daily Worker" said in an editorial: "This is excellent evidence that Khrushchev and his government are not just talking about peace and disarmament, they are taking practical steps to match their words with deeds." The editorial emphasized: "If the Soviet Union's actions are compared with the fact that NATO General Norstad is constantly demanding the establishment of more divisions and the West German armed forces are constantly and alarmingly increasing, then the contrast between the Soviet Union's actions and Western empty talk is even more striking."

The Conservative newspaper "Daily Express" called Khrushchev's statement "a strong and far-sighted gesture" and said that Khrushchev "has once again earned a reputation for taking the initiative on an issue of lasting importance." The newspaper also demanded: "For years, the goal of Western policy has been to deal with the Russians with man against man and bomb against bomb. Now, let the politicians also compete with Khrushchev on the major issue of peace."

The Labour Party's "Daily Herald" said that this is a surprising and welcome way to set the pace for the summit meeting. The newspaper said: "Clearly, the reduction of Russian troops makes it more worthwhile than ever before to try to establish an arms limitation zone in Europe, which is common sense. Macmillan should do it."

France's "L'Humanité" today devoted almost the entire front page and the entire fourth page to Khrushchev's speech at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting yesterday. "L'Humanité" also published an article written by its Moscow correspondent Pierre Goudard on the Soviet Union's announcement of the reduction of Soviet armed forces, in which Goudard pointed out: This decision by the Soviet government "embodies good intentions and contributes to international relaxation."

Goudard wrote: "It is natural that this extremely important speech finally focused entirely on looking to the future. The Soviet Union is engaged in a peaceful competition, confident of winning in the struggle to improve welfare and improve modern technology for the service of mankind. The billions of rubles saved by disarmament will be used to build houses, reclaim new land, and accelerate the completion of the Seven-Year Plan." "Liberation" emphasized that the new decision announced by the Soviet government on reducing armed forces sets an example for the United States.

Greece's "Independent News" pointed out that the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting is of great significance to the entire international situation in recent times.

    兄弟国家报纸热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫的建议
    苏联裁军表明世界和平力量占明显优势
    西方国家舆论普遍重视苏联这一争取和平的重大措施
    新华社15日讯　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天表示热烈支持和欢迎苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫14日在最高苏维埃会议上提出的关于在一、两年内再次单方面裁减苏联武装部队一百二十万人的建议。
    这家报纸说，朝鲜人民同全世界上爱好和平的人民一道热烈欢迎这项建议，并且十分感谢苏联人民为争取缓和国际紧张局势和世界和平而进行的始终如一的努力。
    这家报纸指出，苏联采取的这一果断的步骤树立了西方国家应当仿效的光辉榜样。如果西方帝国主义者仍企图以空谈来掩盖他们的凶恶本质，而不效法苏联的榜样，那么他们必将遭到更加惨重的失败。
    越南“人民报”今天发表社论，热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫提出的再一次裁减苏联武装部队的建议。社论指出，这一建议在当前局势下有着非常重大的意义。当以美国为首的帝国主义各国继续进行军备竞赛、加强军事侵略集团的时候，当美国一些好战分子不断叫嚣进攻苏联的时候，人们清楚地看到苏联将再次裁减武装部队一百多万人的行动是苏联和社会主义阵营的无敌力量的表现。社论说，全世界人民深刻地了解到，当前国际局势所以得到改善，主要是由于苏联的强大和苏联为和平和各民族之间的合作进行了不懈的努力。
    新华社15日讯　苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在最高苏维埃会议上的报告受到社会主义国家人民的热烈欢迎。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”今天发表社论说，苏联的这个单方面的步骤不仅受到苏联人民和社会主义阵营的热烈欢迎，而且也受到全世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎。报纸强调指出，裁减武装部队“表明苏联的巨大力量和整个社会主义阵营的蓬勃发展，表明和平力量在世界上明显地占优势”。报纸谴责阿登纳总理和美国主张冷战的人们奉行的使国际关系尖锐化的政策。报纸还说，显而易见，苏联政府的这个清楚地表明它的和平意图的步骤，将有助于为最高级会议创造良好的气氛和促进裁军谈判。
    波兰“人民论坛报”的评论指出，社会主义强国提出单方面裁军，毫无疑问将有利于国际紧张局势的继续缓和。评论接着指出，只有不想威胁任何人，和没有任何侵略目的的强国才能作出这样的决定。因此，西方国家的人民将会向自己的政府提出这样的问题：停止核武器竞赛的障碍是什么？为什么美国在日内瓦不断地提出新的条件使停止核武器试验问题达不成协议？苏联在裁减自己的军队，而西方为什么还要扩建自己的武装力量？评论最后指出，波兰人民热烈欢迎兄弟的苏联对裁军和继续缓和国际紧张局势以及加强和平的事业所作的新的和具有伟大意义的贡献。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”说，现在，裁军问题是当代所有最重要问题的焦点。如果这问题像苏联建议的那样得到解决，国际紧张局势和各国间的互不信任将会匿迹。报纸强调指出，各国人民的利益要求西方国家政府也走上苏联政府所走的道路。
    据新华社15日讯　苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在最高苏维埃会议上发表的苏联决定单方面裁减一百二十万武装部队的声明受到西方各国舆论界的广泛重视，许多报纸对苏联这一争取和平的重大措施表示欢迎。
    英国“工人日报”在社论中说：“这是一个极好的证据，证明赫鲁晓夫和他的政府不止是口头上谈论和平与裁军，他们正在采取实际的步骤使言行一致。”社论着重指出：“如果把苏联的行动同北大西洋公约组织诺斯塔德将军经常要求建立更多的师以及西德武装部队不断惊人地增加这些事实作一比较，那末，苏联的行动同西方空谈之间的对比就更显著了。”
    保守党人的报纸“每日快报”把赫鲁晓夫的声明称为“一个强有力的和有远见的姿态”，并且说，赫鲁晓夫“由于在一个具有持久重要意义的问题上取得了主动而再次赢得了声誉”。这家报纸还提出要求说：“几年来，西方政策的目标一直是用人对付人、炸弹对付炸弹来同俄国人周旋。现在，让政治家在重大的和平问题上也同赫鲁晓夫分庭抗礼罢。”
    工党的“每日先驱报”说，这是为最高级会议规定步调的一种惊人的和受欢迎的办法。这家报纸说：“显然，俄国军队的裁减使得在欧洲建立一个军备限制地区比以前任何时候都更值得尝试，这是一种常识。麦克米伦应该这样做。”
    法国“人道报”今天以第一版几乎全版和整个第四版的篇幅刊载了赫鲁晓夫昨天在苏联最高苏维埃会议上发表的演说。“人道报”并且发表了该报驻莫斯科特派记者皮埃尔·古达德就苏联宣布裁减苏联武装部队人员一事写的一篇文章，古达德指出：苏联政府的这一决定“体现良好的意愿，对国际缓和作出了贡献”。
    古达德写道：“这个极其重要的讲话最后完全着眼于展望未来，那是很自然的。苏联从事和平竞赛，确信将在增进福利、提高为人类服务的现代技术的奋斗中获胜。由于裁军而节省下来的几十亿卢布，将用于建造住宅，开垦新土地，加速完成七年计划。”“解放报”强调指出，苏联政府宣布的关于裁减武装力量的新的决定给美国树立了一个榜样。
    希腊的“独立新闻报”指出，苏联最高苏维埃会议对于近来整个国际局势有着十分重大的意义。
