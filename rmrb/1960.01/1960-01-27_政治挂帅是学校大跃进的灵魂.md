Putting Politics in Command is the Soul of the School's Great Leap Forward
Chen Shunyao, Deputy Secretary of the Tsinghua University Committee of the Communist Party of China

The Great Significance of the School's Great Leap Forward

For the past two years, under the guidance of the General Line and promoted by the nationwide Great Leap Forward, Tsinghua University, like many sister schools, has been undergoing a profound ideological revolution, educational revolution, and technological revolution. The breadth, depth, speed, and intensity of this revolution are unprecedented in the history of education. The great and far-reaching significance of this revolution is becoming increasingly evident as the school's work continues to leap forward. Facts powerfully prove that higher industrial schools have the potential to carry out scientific research and innovate educational work at an unprecedentedly high speed. This is a very important matter. The speed of scientific research and the training of technical cadres directly affects the speed of socialist construction. Science comes from production, and the development of science promotes production; the educational work of training technical cadres must be based on the development of production, and the improvement of the quality of educational work will promote production. The trend of development in the past two years has confirmed that education and scientific work have the potential to adapt to and promote the current Great Leap Forward in socialist construction.

What kind of speed can be used to carry out scientific research work? We and bourgeois experts have fundamental differences in our answers to this question. They have always believed that a young teacher who graduates from university must also learn from famous teachers, supplement their basic knowledge, and consult literature before they can start writing papers and conducting scientific research after three to five years. At the beginning of the nationwide twelve-year science plan in 1956, Qian Weichang proposed a method for calculating the growth rate of scientific and technological cadres in China, which was: first, select a number of existing scholars as mentors, with one mentor leading three to five disciples, and the disciples would complete their apprenticeship in three years. After a few years, when they became more mature, they would each lead three to five "grandchildren disciples." According to his calculation method, what would be the speed of scientific research development at Tsinghua University? Tsinghua currently has only over fifty professors, and even fewer meet the qualifications he believes are necessary to lead disciples. To enable more than a thousand young teachers at Tsinghua to take turns following mentors and start scientific research work, many people would have to wait until their hair turned white. As for teachers in new majors who cannot find mentors now, their future is even more bleak. With so few researchers, the number of results that can be produced each year is also predictable. However, what kind of speed has the Great Leap Forward at Tsinghua University pointed out to us in the past two years? Teachers, students, staff, and workers work together, and the level of production and scientific research has leaped upward, from trial-producing simple pot-type steam engines to designing and manufacturing highly precise program-controlled drilling machines, from trial-producing 1.7-kilowatt electric motors to designing and manufacturing high-speed motors, analog motors, and micro-motors with high technological requirements, and from only being able to do general chemical experiments and knowing nothing about production to producing special plastics in intermediate factories. Departments such as water conservancy, civil engineering, and architecture immediately took on national key projects such as the design of giant dams and grand theaters. Departments such as engineering physics, radio, and automatic control even climbed straight to the cutting edge of science. More than six hundred scientific papers have been written or are being written in 1959, three times that of 1958, six times that of 1956, and eighty times the annual average before liberation. The development of production and scientific research in the past two years, due to adhering to the socialist direction, has not only been high-speed but also high-quality. This is manifested in the close combination of production and scientific research with socialist construction, and many projects have significant national economic importance. The scientific research also demonstrated a highly valuable spirit of originality, being good at absorbing advanced foreign experience and proposing unique insights and approaches based on actual conditions. This was demonstrated in the design projects for the Miyun Reservoir and micro-cars. The scientific research in 1959 not only underwent practical testing but also made theoretical summaries, with products and papers, demonstrating a scientific style that combined theory with practice. Obviously, with the foundation and experience of the past two years, the quality and speed of future production and scientific research can be further improved and leap forward again.

Can high-speed training of technical cadres needed for socialist construction be achieved? There are also fundamental differences in answering this question. In early 1957, a core issue in the hundred-day debate on the two roads of education work at Tsinghua University was whether industrial universities should and could train engineers. Qian Weichang and others insisted that the school's training goal should not be engineers. Their reason was that engineers must have practical engineering experience, and this experience can only be obtained through long-term practical training. At the same time, they contradictorily proposed that schools only need to teach mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and graduates will naturally "infer other things from one case" in production. The hypocrisy of this theory can be confirmed from Qian Weichang himself. He has always touted himself as a scientist and engineer. Last year, he received the production task of analyzing and calculating the grand theater's cantilever, and for dealing with the spatial thin-walled structure problem of the cantilever, an expert like him who has always been known for studying plates and shells should have been able to "infer other things from one case" excellently. However, the facts were unexpected, and the result was full of errors and ended inconclusively. Graduates of the old Tsinghua School of Engineering could only learn mathematics, physics, chemistry, and some fragmented technical basic theories in school, and they still had to start from scratch in production practice, often taking one or two decades to reach the level of an engineer. From this, we can see the growth rate of an engineer in old China, which was truly a path of less, slow, poor, and expensive. After liberation, the results of the first teaching reform greatly improved the level of graduates, and they could generally take on the work of an engineer after a few years of training. In the past two years, due to the implementation of the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," the school has undergone major changes. From our initial exploration, as long as we continue to leap forward, it is entirely possible to strive to directly train technical backbones who are both red and expert and capable of undertaking the work of a considerable engineer in about six years. Why can we train technical backbones needed for socialist construction in a more, faster, better, and more economical way? This is because Chairman Mao has determined that the school's training goal is to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. This is because productive labor has been introduced into the education process, and the school itself has become a three-in-one base for education, production, and scientific research. Educational work is directly combined with national socialist construction, and students are both laborers and intellectuals. With the three-in-one combination of education, production, and scientific research as the center, our education system, teaching content, and teaching methods have undergone a series of innovations, so that the entire education process better reflects the combination of red and expert, the combination of theory and practice, the combination of physical labor and mental labor, and the combination of collectively completing production and scientific research tasks with individual comprehensive development. Graduation design is a concentrated manifestation of these combinations. Relying on the Party's education policy, we can train cadres who are both red and expert, and we have indeed trained cadres who are both red and expert. For example, the students of the Water Conservancy Department's 1958 graduates (referred to as Water 8 Class), under the guidance of teachers, consciously implemented the Party's policies, completed the design work of Miyun and several other reservoirs in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and many graduates also served as engineers on construction sites. Some were responsible for the design of an 800-kilowatt hydroelectric station as soon as they left school, and some independently took on the technical guidance work of a work area in a large power station in Jilin Province. According to the statistics of one class of Water 8, in the past year, 11 out of 25 students in the class (about 44%) were commended and won honorary titles such as "Advanced Worker," "Red Banner Assault Team Member," "Youth Activist," and "Five-Good Youth." Most of the study time for the students of Water 8 Class was before this educational revolution. Since they can have such outstanding achievements, then it is only natural that the level of the 1958 Water 9 Class graduates will exceed that of the Water 8 Class. With the continuous improvement of the quality of all educational work, we certainly have reason to believe that future graduates will reach a higher level. Two years of experience tell us that as long as we make unremitting efforts, it is entirely possible to strive to directly train technical backbones who are both red and expert in about six years. Looking at the number of students trained, this year's graduates number 1,450, more than double that of 1955, equivalent to 40 times the average number of graduates from the Tsinghua University School of Engineering before liberation. Can such quality and speed be dreamed of by those who are full of bourgeois educational traditions?!

In a short period of two years, we have successfully realized an unprecedented educational revolution, created unprecedented high speed and high quality, and explored some very valuable experiences, adding new chapters to communist education. We must have a full estimate of the great achievements of the school's Great Leap Forward. In the past, some people who called themselves education experts, their highest ideal was only to run an American MIT or Caltech. Compared with our socialist universities today, these institutions are truly not worth mentioning. The narrow scale of bourgeois education can in no way measure the greatness of the proletarian education cause.

What is the reason that our work in the past two years has been able to develop so rapidly? It is difficult to understand if you simply look at the material and technical conditions. The most fundamental thing is that proletarian politics has taken command—adhering to the Party's leadership, implementing the socialist General Line and the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," and the thought of Marxism-Leninism has triumphed over bourgeois thought.

The Soul of the Great Leap Forward is Putting Politics in Command

Education and science belong to the realm of ideology, are part of the superstructure, and serve politics. In our country, science and technology and education must be guided by Marxism-Leninism and serve proletarian politics in order to have great goals and motivation, find the direction and path forward, and thus have vigorous vitality and creativity.

Establishing Socialist Ambitions and Eliminating Inferiority Complexes Can Generate the Greatest Motivation and Confidence

For several years, some people have been shouting about developing science and technology, but they adhere to a idealistic worldview, hold individualistic goals, and instead of doing scientific research in a down-to-earth manner, they speculate all day long about "the rise and fall of the scientific market" and try to figure out the secrets to success in the scientific forum, trying to find a shortcut to less labor and early fame. These people also inherited the spiritual legacy of the comprador bourgeoisie of old China and have a strong colonial mentality. They despise China's backward production and are unwilling to conduct scientific research to develop China's production, fearing that doing so will hinder them from gaining prestige in the international academic community. Therefore, they only want to attach themselves to the scientific and technological system of capitalist countries, adding a branch or two. They especially loathe practicality and despise production, only searching in the gaps of foreign magazines, arbitrarily assuming some conditions and doing some conceptual deductions and mathematical derivations. Obviously, with such a worldview in command, science cannot develop.

Most of the teachers and students at Tsinghua University have the desire to serve socialist construction, and they have seriously combined with China's actual situation, absorbed the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and done a lot of work. This is the main reason for our achievements in teaching and scientific research in the past few years. However, because in the past, the great goals of China's socialist construction and the fundamental path of economic construction were still vague, and the idealism and colonial mentality in our minds had not been completely broken, and we still blindly believed in foreign countries, experts, and books to varying degrees. We did not dare to boldly create things that foreign countries had not done, that were not written in books, or that experts had not said. Without ideological liberation, insufficient motivation and confidence, and the inability to fully exert creativity, scientific research and education work cannot progress faster.

In 1958, the Party formulated the General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" and a series of policies of walking on two legs, and determined the great goal of catching up with and surpassing Britain in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years or even less time, and striving to build China into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture at high speed. The General Line, like a lighthouse, illuminated a path for the people of the whole country to build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. The great goal generated great motivation, mobilizing the enthusiasm of 600 million people. A communization movement and a great leap forward in industry and agriculture appeared across the country. The creative inventions of the masses surged, and the country underwent earth-shaking changes. This situation greatly encouraged teachers, students, staff, and workers throughout the school.

After implementing the Party's education policy, teachers and students personally participated in the country's construction work, came into contact with the working people, and from their own experience, deeply realized the working people's ardent desire and firm will to quickly change China's "poor and blank" face, and also saw the infinite wisdom and strength of the working people from the Great Leap Forward; they also recognized the correctness and greatness of the General Line. Through these, everyone believed that under the leadership of the Party and relying on 600 million people, it was entirely possible for China to build socialism at an unprecedentedly high speed and to catch up with the world's advanced level in a short period of time. In this way, ideology was liberated, superstitions were broken, the old concept that "China is poor and blank and does not have the conditions for high-speed industrial development and cannot catch up with the world's advanced level" was broken, and the old concept that technological revolution can only rely on experts and the masses are powerless was broken. The remnants of the colonial mentality were swept away, the state of mind of inferiority complex changed, and the socialist and communist ambitions were established. People's enthusiasm was boosted, and wisdom also burst out.

In the past, young people always thought that they did not have much knowledge and too little experience, and they did not have the confidence to knock on the door of the palace of science. The Party's education and the facts of the Great Leap Forward made them understand the truth that "the lowly are the most intelligent, and the noble are the most stupid" and that the people are the creators of history; they made them understand that many revolutionaries and innovators in history were young people, and often young people with little knowledge, after the struggle to explore the truth, finally defeated much stronger enemies; and they also made them understand that as long as they listen to the Party, have the right direction, are closely united with 600 million people, use their hands and brains, work hard and conscientiously, and learn while doing, young people can also exert infinite power. Especially when the Party entrusted many important engineering tasks that only white-haired experts were allowed to undertake in the past to these young people, the Party's trust and encouragement to the young people made them more sincerely believe in the Party and full of self-confidence. Chairman Mao said, "Young people are the sun at eight or nine in the morning." Only when the fog of the bourgeois worldview—the fog of belittling the working people and the new forces—disappears, can young people radiate its inexhaustible light and heat.

These facts fully show that we must break the colonial mentality of blindly believing in foreign countries and the bourgeois worldview of blindly believing in experts and not believing in the masses, we must establish the great goals of socialism and communism, liberate the masses from the mental state of inferiority complex, recognize their historical mission, and consciously act, so that the Great Leap Forward can have an inexhaustible source of motivation.

Clarifying the General Line of Socialist Construction, Respecting Materialism, and Respecting Dialectics Can Inspire the Greatest Wisdom and Creativity

The General Line of socialist construction and a whole set of policies of walking on two legs are a creative combination of the universal laws of socialist construction and China's reality, and are living materialism and dialectics. People learn the General Line, compare the facts before and after the Great Leap Forward, and gradually realize that building socialism in China must start from China's reality, and cannot mechanically transport the rules in books. The idealistic way of thinking is wrong. To carry out economic construction and deal with engineering problems, we must use dialectics as a guide, and we cannot use metaphysics, otherwise it will cause great losses to the work. Walking on two legs in socialist construction can achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, while walking on one leg is bound to be less, slow, poor, and expensive. Walking on two legs is lively and vigorous, while walking on one leg is cold and quiet. From this, everyone criticized the metaphysics existing in the past ways of thinking. In the past, many people were accustomed to considering problems statically, in isolation, and one-sidedly, for example, only considering technical problems, not unifying technology with politics and economics; only considering "good," not unifying it with more, faster, and economical; regarding "foreign" as absolutely good, looking down on Chinese experience, and not combining "foreign methods" with "local methods"; stubbornly believing that only large enterprises are economical, not recognizing the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, and not combining large, medium, and small enterprises; they listed various industrial departments in parallel, unable to distinguish the primary and secondary, unable to find the internal connections, and not knowing "taking steel as the key link," grasping the center to promote the overall situation. All of this is the metaphysics way of thinking at work, which is the tight band on people's heads, binding people's creativity. In the past, people were unconscious and did not feel the seriousness of its harm. Through the practice of the Great Leap Forward, they deeply felt its reactionary nature and stimulated a strong desire to learn dialectical materialism. From the practice of the Great Leap Forward, people also realized that "conditionalism" would make people's minds rigid, and recognized that starting from reality, analyzing specific conditions, and not succumbing to conditions. Under the same objective conditions, as long as we give full play to subjective initiative, we can strive to transform unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions and turn bad things into good things. From 1957 to 1958, China's natural geographical conditions did not change, but an unprecedented Great Leap Forward appeared. The General Line and labor practice have given people the most vivid political lessons, making people realize that we must break idealism and metaphysics, and we must respect dialectics and materialism.

Marxism-Leninism opened people's minds and inspired infinite creativity. All the "rules" and "frameworks" that bound people's thinking were broken, people dared to think and dare to do, and everything had to be tried. As a result of ideological liberation, creation and innovation surged.

First, the school, according to the General Line and a whole set of policies of walking on two legs, combined with specific conditions, proposed grasping "machinery, electricity, and cutting-edge technology" as the key link to drive the overall situation, as the direction for carrying out scientific research and establishing production bases. At the same time, grasping cutting-edge science and technology projects to promote the common improvement of cutting-edge majors and general majors. The whole school, centered around the three "marshals" (steel, machinery, and grain) and the two "forerunners" (electricity and transportation), took the method of walking on two legs and acted in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. In order to solve the shortage of steel, the Department of Mechanical Engineering used iron instead of steel, studied the wide application of ductile iron, and looked for new spheroidizing agents with abundant material sources in China. In order to solve the lack of heavy machinery, the method of "combining small to make big" was adopted, and "electroslag welding" and "overlay welding" were successfully researched. In order to grasp the cutting edge of machinery, several departments jointly researched and manufactured several program-controlled machine tools. According to the policy of combining local and foreign methods, an experimental power plant combining local and foreign methods was built, inexpensive local electrical appliances (switches) and high-grade clay cement were made, and a distinctive local and foreign building for the commune was built with reed boards. The Department of Water Conservancy clarified the policy of combining "large, medium, and small," creatively solved the problem of water overflowing small earth dams by combining local and foreign methods, and used "artificial siltation" to form a "natural blanket," turning unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions, and solved the problem of leakage in reservoirs built on thick sand and gravel layers in a good and economical way. In the design of large reservoirs, they boldly tried to replace diversion tunnels with corridors and proposed a new construction method for concrete water barrier curtains, striving to build large reservoirs in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. In order to solve the problem of "transportation first," the Department of Power, starting from the current production and usage conditions, comprehensively considered "saving steel, easy to produce, reliable to use, easy to drive, small and flexible, beautiful and generous," and designed and manufactured micro-cars. In the past two years, all of our school's production and scientific research projects have been like this. These designs have begun to break away from simple imitation and then, starting from China's conditions, absorb advanced foreign experience and creatively solve technical problems. What is the source of this creativity? It is the implementation of the socialist construction General Line with dialectical materialism as the guiding ideology. The facts of our school's Great Leap Forward fully prove that the correct worldview can guide us to understand the laws of nature and society, and acting in accordance with the Party's policies can give full play to the creativity of scientific and technical workers.

It is precisely because of the implementation of the General Line and the Party's education policy that the political consciousness and ideological level of teachers and students have been improved; the improvement of the political consciousness and ideological level of teachers and students has promoted the improvement of the ideology of the curriculum and the improvement of the teaching process in accordance with the principle of unity of red and expert.

Combining Education with Productive Labor and Combining Physical Labor with Mental Labor Can Develop Science and Education at High Speed

Natural science is the summary of the struggle for production, and productive practice is the source of scientific development. In the past, schools were divorced from productive practice, so science could not be fully developed. As a result of introducing production into schools, a broad world has been opened up for scientific research. The production tasks raised a large number of problems that urgently needed to be solved and further developed, which strongly promoted the development of scientific research. This is true not only in technical science, but also in basic science, which many people have always thought is not directly related to production. Isn't the best proof that the mathematics teaching and research group participated in the stress analysis of giant dams and obtained a new "template relaxation method," which developed the theory of the relaxation method?

The strict test of productive practice has prompted people to gradually develop scientific thinking methods, scientific work attitudes, and styles. Idealistic metaphysics cannot pass the test of productive reality. People must learn to use dialectical materialism to guide practice in order to recognize objective laws. Many important scientific research results in 1959 were achieved only after dozens or even hundreds of times of practice, summary, re-practice, and re-summary. Abstract fantasy divorced from reality or blind groping without theoretical guidance will inevitably lead to failure, and there can be no half-point of luck here.

Practice promotes people to seriously study theory, truly master theory, and enrich and develop theory. In the past, our teaching sometimes listed various equipment and methods, but did not analyze the conditions under which they were summarized, and did not indicate their scope of application. Or, starting only from some basic formulas, assuming some conditions, we would deduce new formulas, but did not indicate the physical meaning of these new formulas, and did not explain which assumptions were allowed and which were not allowed under different circumstances. So even if we remember these formulas and methods, we still cannot apply them when we encounter practical problems. Through practice, people truly mastered the theory and enriched and developed them according to new practice.

The combination of mental labor and physical labor, the laborization of intellectuals, and the intellectualization of the working people, being able to use both the brain and the hands, can best realize the scientific research method of combining theory and practice, and can develop science at high speed. After implementing the Party's education policy, teachers and students are not afraid of hard work, go deep into the field, investigate and study, collect original materials, make models and instruments themselves, carry out measurements, read literature, study theory, and summarize the results of practice, best reflecting the combination of theory and practice, so they can achieve scientific research results in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. In the past, some teachers only used their brains and mouths, but did not use their hands or run errands, and even disdained to do experiments. Teachers read books and do calculations, and laboratory technicians lacked theoretical knowledge and did experiments blindly. After the teachers calculated well, they arbitrarily took some data from other people's experiments and drew a few curves as theoretical basis. Can this be called scientific work? The separation of physical labor and mental labor is a product of class society. It once played a certain role in the development of science and culture, but only under the conditions of eliminating classes and eliminating the differences between physical labor and mental labor can science be developed at the highest speed. The implementation of the policy of "combining education with productive labor" is a step towards the combination of physical labor and mental labor, and therefore has promoted the high-speed development of scientific work.

In capitalist countries, there have also been some "work-study" methods, but that is actually just a means of deception, used to exploit a few poor students. In the final analysis, it is still to serve the bourgeois politics, which is fundamentally different from our goal today of realizing the Marxist education principle and combining physical labor with mental labor. Some people also think that students' participation in labor is only useful for "red" and harmful to "expert," but they do not know that the combination of education and labor is the most profound revolution in education, the most thorough realization of the principle of combining theory and practice, which can not only make students red faster, but also make students better experts. Combining education with productive labor does not lower theory, on the contrary, it must be done in this way to fundamentally improve the level of theoretical teaching. It does not violate the laws of learning, on the contrary, it must be done in this way to make the teaching process more in line with the laws of human cognition; combining education with productive labor enables students to obtain more comprehensive knowledge, rather than partial and incomplete book knowledge. It is precisely because of this combination that our educational work has taken a qualitative leap.

Strengthening the Party's Leadership, Implementing the Mass Line, and Combining Professional Educators and Scientific Workers with the Masses Can Develop Science and Education at High Speed

Science and technology are originally the summary of human practice, but in the old society, people who personally participated in practice and had practical experience were oppressed and lacked culture, so they could not well summarize experience and develop science. The intellectuals of the exploiting classes were divorced from the working people, so the process of summarizing human practical experience was slow and tortuous, especially the intellectuals in schools were far away from production and far away from the working people, just "a room, two books, quietly doing work." Such a quiet study is actually just a pool of stagnant water that cuts off the source of scientific creation, evaporating the breath of the corrupt scholars. Therefore, in schools, only "reviews" and other things can be written, introducing the achievements of foreign science and technology. A textbook and a few homework problems often take one or two decades, and the development of science and technology is very slow. After the first teaching reform in our school, the teaching process added production practice, graduation design, etc., and the school began to change the closed state, established some contacts with the enterprise departments, and new things and new problems in production began to flow into the school, enriching and filling the teaching content and scientific research, and promoting its development. However, only when the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor" was implemented, the school directly undertook important production and scientific research tasks, and applied a set of mass line and mass movement working methods that the Party had accumulated rich experience in revolutionary construction to the fields of scientific research and education work, the situation changed greatly. The three-in-one combination of education, production, and scientific research promoted the three-in-one combination of teachers, students, and workers in the school and the two-in-one combination of inside and outside the school. The enthusiasm of the young teachers, students, and staff, who accounted for the vast majority in the school and could not ask about scientific research in the past, was mobilized. Through them, they were combined with the broad masses outside the school, creating a set of methods for investigation and research and following the mass line. Under the leadership of the Party and the guidance of experts, the experience of the masses was concentrated on a large scale in a planned, led, and organized manner. This also includes the experience of predecessors and foreign countries. For example, in order to design large dams, the Department of Water Conservancy used collective strength to collect data on about 500 dam types in the world; in order to design the grand theater, the Department of Architecture used collective strength to translate and collect data on 150 famous theaters published in 32 countries and in nine languages. After the teachers and students concentrated the experience of the masses and the relevant data, they summarized, experimented, and found the rules and solutions under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, and then handed them over to the masses for use in practice, and the masses and practice tested and developed them. Repeatedly, the scientific level is constantly improved. The school door is opened, the wisdom of the masses is like a fountain, all flowing into the school, the school's production and scientific research have such a rich source, and added so many research forces, how can it not develop rapidly? From then on, the era of a few experts and scholars doing academic work in a cold and quiet way in the school is over. The teachers, students, staff, and workers of the whole school and the broad masses outside the school are combined together, and under the leadership of the Party, a situation of consciously, planned, and creatively developing science is formed. In the past two years, the units that have had cooperative relations with our school and the talented people we have visited are countless, and the Party and government organs, experts and scholars, skilled workers, etc. in various places have given us enthusiastic support. Our school's many engineering designs and research results are condensed with the wisdom and experience of millions of people, and can be said to be the achievements of the masses' scientific research.

From the perspective of education, not only Tsinghua University itself, but also all the advanced production sites related to us in the country are our classrooms, not only the teachers of Tsinghua University, but also all the capable people in the country are our teachers, and teachers, students, staff, and workers teach and learn from each other. Many local party committees and enterprise departments have participated in the leadership of the school, and the Party's policies and routes and various policies (especially industrial policies) are the content of our teaching. Which era has ever run such a large school? Which school has ever hired so many teachers? Has there ever been such strong leadership? The era of a few educators running schools in a cold and quiet way is over, and the combination of national school running and professional educators running schools has initially formed, and our school running power has increased by hundreds of millions of times, how can our schools not leap forward?

In 1959, Tsinghua University achieved a greater leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The fundamental reason for the continuous Great Leap Forward is that politics takes command, the Party's leadership; it is because the school resolutely implemented the General Line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor"; it is because Mao Zedong Thought has grasped the masses, and thus has generated a huge material force. We must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and continue to forge ahead bravely.

    政治挂帅是学校大跃进的灵魂
    中共清华大学委员会副书记　陈舜瑶
    学校大跃进的重大意义
    两年来，在总路线的照耀下，在全国大跃进的推动下，清华大学也像许多兄弟学校一样正经历着一场深刻的思想大革命、教育大革命和技术大革命。这场革命的广泛、深入、迅速、猛烈，在教育史上是找不到前例的。这场革命伟大的、深远的意义正随着学校工作的不断跃进而日益显示出来。事实有力地证明：高等工业学校完全有可能以空前的高速度开展科学研究和革新教育工作。这是一件十分重要的事情。科学研究和培养技术干部的速度直接影响到社会主义建设的速度。科学来自生产，科学的发展又促进生产；培养技术干部的教育工作必须建立在生产发展基础上，而教育工作质量的提高又将促进生产。两年发展的趋势已经可以肯定，教育和科学工作完全有可能适应和促进当前社会主义建设的大跃进。
    究竟能用怎样的速度开展科学研究工作呢？我们和资产阶级专家对于这个问题的回答是有着原则的分歧的。他们一直认为一个青年教师大学毕了业，还必须拜名师，补基础，查文献，三、五年以后，才可以着手写论文，进行科学研究。1956年全国进行十二年科学规划之初，钱伟长曾提出过一个计算中国科学技术干部成长速度的办法，就是：先从现有的学者中选若干人作导师，一个导师带三、五个弟子，弟子三年出师，经过几年，更加成熟了，再各带三、五个“再传弟子”，照这样五、六年一辈地传下去，如果淘汰不多，在他们来说，那就是最高的速度了。按照他的计算办法，清华大学科学研究开展的速度将是怎样一种情景呢？清华现有的教授不过五十余人，合乎他们认为具备带徒弟资格的就更少于此数。要使清华一千多青年教师都能轮流跟上导师，开始科学研究工作，那末许多人要等得头发白了。至于现在找不到导师的新专业的教师，更是前途渺茫了。研究人员这样少，每年能作出多少成果，也就可想而知了。但是这两年清华大学大跃进给我们指出了一种怎样的速度呢？师、生、职、工一齐动手，生产和科学研究的水平跳跃上升，由试制简单的锅驼机跃到了设计和制造高度精密的程序控制钻床，由试制一点七瓩的电动机跃到了设计制造工艺要求很高的高速电机、模拟电机、微型电机等，由只会作一般化学实验、对生产一无所知跃到了在中间工厂中生产出特种塑料。水利、土木、建筑等系一上马就接受了全国性的重点工程如巨型水坝、大剧院的设计等等。工程物理、无线电、自动控制等系更是直攀科学尖端。1959年的科学论文已写成和正在写的有六百余篇。为1958年的三倍，为1956年的六倍，为解放前每年平均数的八十倍。这两年生产和科学研究的发展，由于坚持了社会主义的方向，不但是高速度的，而且是高质量的，这表现生产和科学研究密切结合了社会主义建设，许多项目都具有较大的国民经济意义。在科学研究中还表现了大可珍贵的独创精神，善于吸收外国的先进经验，根据实际的条件，提出独特的见解和作法。这在密云水库、微型汽车等等设计项目中都有所表现。1959年的科学研究不但经过了实践的检验，而且作出了理论总结，有产品、有论文，表现了理论与实际相结合的科学作风。显然，有了这两年的基础和经验，今后的生产、科学研究的质量和速度还可以再提高、再跃进。
    究竟能不能用高速度培养出社会主义建设所需要的技术干部呢？对这个问题的回答也是存在着原则分歧的。1957年初，清华大学关于教育工作两条道路的百日论战中一个核心问题就是工业大学应不应、能不能培养出工程师？钱伟长等人坚持学校的培养目标不应是工程师，他们的理由是工程师必须有实际工程经验，而这些经验只有通过长期实际锻炼才能得到。同时他们又自相矛盾地提出学校里只须教些数、理、化，毕业生到生产中自然就会“举一反三”。这个理论的虚伪从钱伟长本身就可以得到证实。他一向是以科学家兼工程师自诩的。去年他接到分析计算大剧院眺台的生产任务，对于处理眺台这种空间薄壁结构问题，像他这样一向以研究板壳著称的专家应当是出色行当“举一反三”的了，但是事实出乎人们意料之外，结果竟是谬误百出，不了了之。旧清华工学院毕业生在学校中只能学到数、理、化和一些零星的技术基础理论，到生产实践中还必须从头学起，往往要经过一、二十年的时间才能达到工程师水平。由此就可以看出旧中国一个工程师成长的速度了，这真是一条少慢差费的道路。解放后，进行第一次教学改革的结果，毕业生水平大大提高，一般只要经过几年锻炼就可以担任工程师的工作。这两年由于贯彻执行了党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，学校又发生了大变革。从我们初步摸索到的经验看，只要我们继续跃进，完全有可能争取在六年上下的时间，从学校直接培养出能担任相当工程师工作的又红又专的技术骨干来。为什么我们能够多、快、好、省地培养出社会主义建设需要的技术骨干呢？这是由于毛主席确定了学校的培养目标是有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者。这是由于生产劳动引进了教育过程，学校本身变成了教育、生产和科学研究的三联合基地，教育工作与全国社会主义建设直接结合了起来，学生既是劳动者，又是知识分子。以教育、生产、科学研究三结合为中心，我们的教育制度、教学内容、教学方式都进行了一系列的革新，使整个教育过程更好地体现着红与专的结合、理论与实践的结合、体力劳动与脑力劳动的结合、集体完成生产、科学研究任务与个人受到全面培养的结合。毕业设计就是这些结合的集中表现。依靠了党的教育方针，我们就能够培养出又红又专的干部，我们也果然培养出了又红又专的干部。例如水利系1958年毕业生（简称水8班）的同学，在教师的指导下，自觉地贯彻了党的方针政策，多、快、好、省地完成了密云等好几个水库的设计工作，很多毕业生还在工地担任了相当于工程师的工作，有的一出校就负责一个八百瓩水电站的设计工作，有的在吉林省一个大电站中独立负担起工区技术指导工作。据水8一个班的统计，一年来全班二十五人中，有十一人（约占44％）受到表扬，获得了“先进工作者”、“红旗突击手”、“青年积极分子”、“五好青年”等光荣称号。水8班同学过去大部分学习时间还在这次教育革命以前，他们既然能有这样出色的成绩，那末，1958年水9班毕业生的水平又超过了水8班，这就是很自然的了。随着全部教育工作质量的不断提高，我们当然有理由相信今后的毕业生一定能达到更高的水平。两年的经验告诉我们，只要我们不懈地努力，完全有可能争取在六年上下的时间直接培养出又红又专的技术骨干来。再从培养学生的数量看，今年毕业生一千四百五十人，超过1955年的两倍，相当于解放前清华大学工学院每年毕业生平均数的四十倍。这样的质量、这样的速度，难道是那些满脑子资产阶级教育传统的人所能梦想得到的吗？！
    在短短两年期间，我们顺利地实现了史无前例的教育大革命，创造了空前的高速度、高质量，摸索到一些十分宝贵的经验，为共产主义教育学添了新的篇章。对于学校大跃进的巨大成绩我们必须有充分的估计。过去有些自命为教育专家的人，他们最高的理想不过是办个美国麻省理工学院、加省理工学院，这些院校和我们今天的社会主义大学相比，真正是不在话下。用资产阶级教育的狭小尺度是无论如何衡量不了无产阶级教育事业的伟大的。
    究竟是什么原因使得我们这两年的工作能够这样突飞猛进地发展呢？如果单纯从物质技术条件上看，是难于理解的，最根本的是无产阶级政治挂了帅——坚持了党的领导，贯彻执行了社会主义总路线和“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，马克思列宁主义的思想战胜了资产阶级的思想。
    大跃进的灵魂是政治挂帅
    教育和科学都属于意识形态的范围，是上层建筑，是为政治服务的。在我们国家里，科学技术、教育事业必须以马克思列宁主义思想为指导，为无产阶级政治服务，才能有伟大的目标和动力，才能找到前进的方向和道路，因而也才能有蓬勃的生命力和创造性。
    树立社会主义的雄心大志，打掉妄自菲薄，才能产生最伟大的动力和信心
    几年来一直有人高喊要发展科学技术，但他们坚持唯心主义的世界观，抱着个人主义的目的，不是踏踏实实作科学研究，而是整天推测“科学市场的行情涨落”，揣摸科学论坛的登龙妙术，想寻求一条少劳动、早成名的捷径。这些人还继承了旧中国买办资产阶级的精神遗产，有着浓厚的殖民地心理。他们鄙视中国的生产落后，不愿为发展中国的生产进行科学研究，害怕这样做会妨碍他们在国际学术界获得声誉。因此，他们只想依附在资本主义国家科学技术体系上，添个一枝半叶。他们尤其厌恶实际，鄙视生产，只在外国杂志缝里搜求，随心所欲地假设一些条件、作些概念演绎、数学推导的游戏。显然，这样的世界观挂了帅，科学是不可能发展的。
    清华大学大多数师生抱有为社会主义建设服务的愿望，曾经认真地结合中国实际，吸取苏联的先进经验，作了不少工作，这就是我们前几年教学和科学研究获得成绩的主要原因。但因为过去对于中国社会主义建设的伟大目标和经济建设的根本道路还是模模糊糊的，头脑里唯心论和殖民地心理也没有完全打破，还在不同程度上迷信外国、迷信专家、迷信书本。外国没作过的、书本上没写过的、专家没讲过的就不敢大胆创造。思想不解放，动力和信心不足，创造性不能充分发挥，科学研究和教育工作就不能更快进展。
    1958年党制定了“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线和一系列两条腿走路的方针，确定了争取在十五年、或者在更短的时间内，在主要的工业产品产量方面，赶上和超过英国的伟大目标，争取高速度把中国建设成一个有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国。总路线像灯塔，给全国人民照亮了一条多、快、好、省建设社会主义的道路。伟大的目标产生了伟大的动力，它调动了六亿人民的积极性，全国出现了公社化运动和工农业的大跃进，群众的创造发明风起云涌，全国起了翻天复地大变化。这种形势大大鼓舞了全校的师、生、职、工。
    贯彻党的教育方针之后，师生亲自参加了国家的建设工作，接触到劳动人民，从切身经验中，深深体会到劳动人民要求迅速改变中国“一穷二白”面貌的热切愿望和坚强意志，并且从大跃进看到了劳动人民的无穷的智慧和力量；也认识到总路线的正确和伟大。通过这些，大家相信在党的领导下，依靠六亿人民，中国是完全有可能以空前的高速度来建设社会主义的，是完全有可能在短时期内迎头赶上世界的先进水平的。这样一来，思想解放了，迷信打破了，以为“中国一穷二白，不具备高速度发展工业的条件，不可能迎头赶上世界先进水平”的旧观念打破了，以为技术革命只能靠专家、群众无能为力的旧观念打破了。殖民地心理的残余扫掉了，妄自菲薄的精神状态改变了，树立了社会主义、共产主义的雄心大志。人们干劲鼓起来了，智慧也迸发出来了。
    年青人过去一向以为自己学问不大，经验太少，没有信心去敲科学宫殿的大门。党的教育、大跃进的事实，使他们懂得了“卑贱者最聪明，高贵者最愚蠢”人民群众才是历史的创造者的真理；使他们懂得了历史上许多革命家、革新者都是年青人，往往年青的、学问小的人，经过探索真理的斗争，最后战胜了强大得多的敌人；也使他们懂得了只要听党的话，方向对头，和六亿人民紧紧结合在一起，动手动脑，穷干苦干，边干边学，青年也就可以发挥出无穷的力量。尤其是当党把许多以往只有白发专家才允许担任的重要的工程任务委托给这些青年人时，党对青年的信任和鼓励，使青年更加衷心地相信党和充满自信。毛主席说“青年人是早晨八、九点钟的太阳”只有当资产阶级世界观的雾障——轻视劳动人民、轻视新生力量的雾障——消失了之后，青年人才辐射出它无穷竭的光和热来。
    这些事实充分说明，必须打破迷信外国的殖民地心理，和迷信专家、不相信群众的资产阶级世界观，必须树立社会主义、共产主义的伟大目标，使群众从妄自菲薄的精神状态中解放出来，认识自己的历史使命，自觉行动起来，大跃进才能有源源不竭的动力。
    明确社会主义建设的总路线，尊重唯物论、尊重辩证法，才能启发最大的智慧和创造精神
    社会主义建设总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针是社会主义建设的普遍规律与中国实际创造性的结合，是活生生的唯物论和辩证法。人们学习了总路线，对比大跃进前后的事实，逐渐认识到在中国建设社会主义就必须从中国的实际出发，不能机械搬运书本上的条条。唯心论的思想方法是错误的。要进行经济建设、处理工程问题，就必须用辩证法作指导，不能用形而上学，否则就会给工作带来很大损失。在社会主义建设中两条腿走路就能多、快、好、省，一条腿走路必然是少、慢、差、费。两条腿走路轰轰烈烈，一条腿走路冷冷清清。大家由此就联系批判了过去思想方法中存在着的形而上学，不少人过去习惯于静止地、孤立地、片面地考虑问题，譬如，只考虑技术问题，不把技术和政治、经济统一起来；只考虑“好”，不和多、快、省统一起来；把“洋”看成绝对的好，看不起中国经验，不把“洋法”和“土法”结合起来；死死认定只有大型企业才经济，不承认中小型企业的作用，不把大、中、小结合起来；他们把各个工业部门平列起来，分不清主次，找不到内在联系，不知道“以钢为纲”，纲举目张，抓中心推动全面。这一切都是形而上学的思想方法在作怪，它就是套在人们头上的紧箍咒，束缚着人们的创造性。过去人们不自觉，不感到它为害的严重。通过大跃进的实践，才痛切地感到了它的反动性，激发了学习辩证唯物主义的热烈愿望。从大跃进的实践中，人们也体会到“唯条件论”会使人头脑僵化，认识到从实际出发，分析具体条件，而不应屈从于条件。同样的客观条件，只要充分发挥主观能动性，就可以争取把不利条件转化为有利条件，把坏事转化为好事。从1957年到1958年，中国的自然地理条件没有变化，但却出现了空前的大跃进。总路线和劳动实践给人们上了最生动的政治课，使人们体会到必须打破唯心论和形而上学，必须尊重辩证法和唯物论。
    马克思列宁主义打开了人们的头脑，启发了无穷的创造性。一切束缚人思想的“条条”“框框”都冲垮了，人们敢想敢干，一切都要动手试一试，思想解放的结果，创造革新就风起云涌了。
    首先学校根据总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，结合具体条件，提出了抓“机械、电和尖端”为纲，带动全面，作为开展科学研究建立生产基地的方向。同时抓尖端科学技术项目来推动尖端专业和一般专业的共同提高。全校环绕三个“元帅”（钢、机械、粮）和两个“先行”（电、交通），采取两条腿走路的办法，多、快、好、省地行动起来了。为了解决钢的不足，机械系就以铁代钢，研究了球墨铸铁的广泛应用和寻找我国材料来源丰富的新球化剂。为了解决重型机械的缺乏，又采取了“以小拼大”的办法，研究成功“电渣焊”和“堆焊”。为了抓机械的尖端，几个系联合研究制造了好几种程序控制机床。根据土洋结合的方针，建设了土洋结合的实验电厂，制成了物美价廉的土电器（开关）和高标号的粘土水泥，用芦苇板盖成了公社的别具风格的土洋楼。水利系明确了“大中小”结合的方针，用土洋结合的办法创造性地解决了小型土坝过水，又利用“人工放淤”形成“天然铺盖”，使不利条件转化为有利条件，又好又省地解决了厚沙卵石层上修建水库的渗漏问题。在大型水库设计上，他们大胆尝试用廊道代替隧洞导流，和提出混凝土阻水帷幕的新施工方法，争取多、快、好、省地建成大型水库。动力系为了解决“交通先行”问题，从当前的生产和使用条件出发综合考虑了“节省钢材、便于生产、使用可靠、驾驶容易、小巧灵便、美观大方”等要求，设计制造成微型汽车。两年来，我校各个生产和科学研究项目无不如此，这些设计开始脱出了简单模仿，进而从中国条件出发，吸取外国先进经验，创造性地解决了技术问题。这种创造性的源泉是什么呢？那就是以辩证唯物主义作为指导思想贯彻执行了社会主义建设总路线。我校大跃进的事实充分证明了：正确的世界观才能指导我们去认识自然和社会的规律，按党的方针政策办事，才能充分发挥科学技术工作者的创造性。
    正是由于贯彻执行了总路线和党的教育方针，才提高了师生的政治觉悟和思想水平；师生政治觉悟和思想水平的提高又促进了课程思想性的提高和根据红专统一的原则改进了教学过程。
    教育与生产劳动相结合，体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合，才能高速度发展科学和教育事业
    自然科学是生产斗争的总结，生产实践是科学发展的源泉。过去学校脱离生产实践，所以科学也得不到充分的发展，生产引入学校的结果，就给科学研究开辟了广阔的天地，生产任务中提出大量迫切需要解决和进一步发展需要解决的问题，就有力地推动了科学研究的发展。不但在技术科学中如此，就连不少人一向认为与生产不直接相关的基础科学也是如此。数学教研组参加巨型水坝应力分析工作中，得出新的“样板松弛法”，发展了松弛法的理论，不就是最好的证明吗？
    生产实践的严格考验促使人们逐渐养成科学的思维方法，科学的工作态度和作风，唯心主义形而上学是通不过生产实际的检验的。人们必须学会用辩证唯物主义来指导实践，才能认识客观的规律。1959年许多重要的科学研究成果都是经过几十次乃至几百次实践、总结、再实践、再总结，才达到的结果。脱离实际的空想或者没有理论指导的瞎碰，都必然要引导到失败，这里是不能有半点侥幸的。
    实践促进人们认真钻研理论，真正掌握了理论，又丰富、发展了理论。过去我们教学中有时列举各种设备，各种方法，但没有分析它们是在什么条件下总结出来的，没有指明它们的应用范围。或者只从一些基本公式出发，假设一些条件，就推导出新的公式，但没有指明这些新公式的物理意义，没有说明不同情况下，那些假设是允许的，那些是不允许的。所以纵然记住了这些公式和方法，遇到实际问题，仍然不会应用。通过实践，人们才真正掌握了理论，并根据新的实践丰富发展了它们。
    脑力劳动和体力劳动的结合，知识分子劳动化，劳动人民知识化，既能动脑，又能动手，才能最好地实现理论与实际相结合的科学研究方法，才能高速度发展科学。贯彻党的教育方针之后，师生不怕劳累，深入现场，调查研究，搜集原始材料，自己动手作模型仪器，进行量测，阅读文献，钻研理论，总结实践结果，最好地体现了理论与实际的结合，因此能够多、快、好、省，得出科学研究的成果。过去有些教师只动脑动口，不动手不跑腿，甚至连实验都不屑作。教师念书、作计算，实验员缺乏理论知识，盲目作实验，教师计算好了，再从别人实验上任意取些数据，画几条曲线，作为理论根据。难道这能够称得起是科学工作吗？体力劳动和脑力劳动的分家本是阶级社会的产物，当时也曾在发展科学文化上起过一定的作用，但只有在消灭阶级、消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别的条件下，才能最高速度地发展科学，贯彻“教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针正是向着体力劳动与脑力劳动结合前进了一步，因此也就促进了科学工作的高速度发展。
    在资本主义国家中，也曾有过某些“工读”的办法，但那实际上只是欺骗的手段，借以剥削少数穷学生，归根结底，还是为资产阶级政治服务，和我们今天要实现马克思主义教育原则，将体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合是根本不同的两回事。也有人以为学生参加劳动仅仅对“红”有用，对“专”有害，殊不知教育与劳动相结合是教育上的最深刻的革命，是最彻底地实现了理论与实际相结合的原则，不但能使学生更快地红，而且能使学生更好地专。教育与生产劳动相结合，不但不降低理论，相反，必须这样，才能从根本上提高理论教学的水平，它不但不违背学习规律，相反，必须这样，才能使教学过程更符合人的认识规律；教育与生产劳动相结合使学生得到比较全面的知识，而不是片面的不完全的书本知识。正是由于这种结合才引起我们教育工作质的飞跃。
    加强党的领导，贯彻群众路线，把专业的教育工作者和科学工作者同群众结合起来，才能高速度发展科学和教育事业
    科学技术本是人类实践的总结，但是在旧社会中亲身参加实践、有实际经验的人因为受压迫，又没有文化，却不能很好地总结经验，发展科学。而剥削阶级的知识分子又脱离劳动人民，因此人类实践经验的总结过程是缓慢、曲折的，特别是学校中的知识分子更是远离生产，远离劳动人民，只是“一间房，两本书，静静地作功夫”，这样宁静的书斋，实际上不过是断绝了科学创造源泉的一潭死水，蒸发着腐儒气息，因此在学校里只能写些“综述”之类，介绍一下外国科学技术的成就，一本教科书、几个作业题往往用上一、二十年，科学技术的发展是十分缓慢的。我校在第一次教学改革之后，教学过程中，添了生产实习、毕业设计等，学校才初步改变了闭塞的状况，和企业部门建立了一些联系，生产中的新事物、新问题开始流进学校来，丰富和充实了教学内容和科学研究，推动了它的发展。但是只有当贯彻党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针以后，学校直接承当重要的生产科学研究任务，并且把党在革命建设中积累了丰富经验的一套群众路线、群众运动的工作方法也应用到科学研究和教育工作的领域中来，局面才为之大变。教育、生产、科学研究的三结合，促成了学校里教师、学生、工人的三结合和校内外的两结合。在学校里占绝大多数过去一向不能过问科学研究的青年教师、学生、职工，搞科学生产的积极性调动起来了，通过他们又与校外广大群众相结合，创造了一套调查研究、走群众路线的方法。在党的领导下和专家指导下，有计划，有领导，有组织地大规模地把群众的经验集中上来。这里也包括前人和外国的经验。譬如水利系为设计大型水坝，用集体力量搜集了世界上约五百个坝型的资料；建筑系为设计大剧院，用集体力量翻译和收集了三十二个国家、用九种文字发表的一百五十个著名剧院的资料。师生把群众的经验和有关的资料集中之后，再以马克思列宁主义思想为指导，概括总结，进行试验，找出其中的规律，求出解决的方法，再交给群众用到实践中，由群众和实践加以检验和发展。这样的反复进行，科学水平就不断地提高。学校大门敞开了，群众的智慧像万泉奔涌，都汇流到学校中来，学校的生产、科学研究有了这样丰富的源泉，又添了这许多研究的力量，怎能不飞快地发展呢？从此学校里少数专家学者冷冷清清做学问的时代过去了。全校师、生、职、工和校外广大群众结合在一起，在党的领导下，自觉地、有计划地、创造性地发展科学的局面形成了。这两年同我校有过协作关系的单位、我们访问过的能人数也数不清，各地党政机关，各行业的专家学者、能工巧匠等等无不给了我们热情的支援。我校这许多工程设计、研究成果都凝聚着千百万人的智慧和经验，可以说是群众进行科学研究的成果。
    从教育的角度说，不止清华大学本身，而且国内一切与我们有关的先进生产场所都是我们的课堂，不止清华大学的教师，而且国内一切能人都是我们的教师，师、生、职、工也互教互学。很多地方党委、企业部门都参加了学校的领导，党的方针路线，各种政策（特别是工业政策）都是我们教学的内容。哪个时代办过这样大的学校？哪个学校请过这样多的教师？有过这样强的领导？少数教育工作者冷冷清清办学校的时代过去了，全民办学和专业教育工作者办学相结合初步形成了，我们办学的力量亿万倍的增加了，我们的学校怎能不飞跃前进呢？
    1959年清华大学在1958年大跃进的基础上实现了更大的跃进，连续大跃进的根本原因是政治挂帅，党的领导；是由于学校坚决贯彻执行了鼓足干劲、力争上游，多、快、好、省地建设社会主义的总路线，和“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针；是由于毛泽东思想掌握了群众，因而产生了巨大的物质力量。我们必须高举毛泽东思想的红旗继续奋勇前进。
