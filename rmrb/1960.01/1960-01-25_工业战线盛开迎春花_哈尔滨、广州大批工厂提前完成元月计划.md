Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 24th: According to statistics up to the 22nd in Harbin, 702 factories had already completed their January production plans, ahead of schedule by nine to twenty days.

　　In the process of seizing an all-round red start in January production, workers on the Harbin industrial front actively responded to the call of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to "re-equip old factories, re-arm veteran workers, and transform new workers into veteran workers." They further carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and further developed into comprehensive technical transformation, continuously improving the level of mechanization and automation in the city's industrial system. According to preliminary statistics, in January, workers in the city's industrial system put forward a total of 200,020 rationalization proposals, of which 75,000 have been implemented, and more than 5,300 advanced experiences have been promoted. Since November of last year, factories and enterprises in the city have implemented 141 automated production lines, of which 82 were implemented in January; 490 single-machine automation projects were implemented; 3,314 manual operations were mechanized; and 180 loading and unloading operations were mechanized. As a result, production efficiency has increased exponentially, tens of times, and hundreds of times, saving a large amount of labor, improving product quality, and reducing costs. For example, the Harbin Bearing Factory successfully created an automated production line for machining 204 bearing ring blanks, reducing the number of workers from 22 to 4, increasing output by more than double, and increasing labor productivity tenfold. The Harbin Flax Mill recently implemented six automated production lines for short-fiber transportation humidification, combined combing and drawing, and bleaching yarn sizing, reducing 20 working procedures, saving 68 sets of machinery and equipment, saving more than 3,000 square meters of factory buildings, eliminating eight manual operations, and saving 260 laborers, greatly improving production efficiency.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 24th: Two hundred and fifteen factories in Guangzhou have completed their January production plans ahead of schedule. In the first and middle ten days of January, the city's average daily industrial output value increased by 7.8% compared with December of last year.

　　The upsurge of technical performance competitions in many factories continues to move forward. The heating section of the thin steel plate rolling workshop of the Jiehe Steel Plant improved the air intake and coal burning operation methods, and recently created the highest shift output record since the factory was built for three consecutive times. In the technical performance selection competition of the textile industry in the Western District in the past five days, 746 production pacesetters of various kinds have emerged, which has greatly promoted the current production.

　　While striving for more overproduction in January, all factories have actively prepared for production after the Spring Festival. In recent days, more than 230 factories in the Northern District have carried out publicity and mobilization work to ensure that Spring Festival production is better than New Year's Day. Workers at the Southern Tobacco Factory in the Southern District proposed to achieve five goods in Spring Festival production: attendance, quality, output, safety, and labor discipline. Many factories in the Eastern District have issued February production plans, mobilized workers to discuss, formulate measures, and make guarantees, preparing to hold a 10,000-person technical performance competition on the first day of Spring Festival production. Factories in the Northern District are preparing to use pre-shift and post-shift rest time to rush to repair equipment, so that it will neither affect daily production nor allow machine tools to "spend the festival" with problems.

    工业战线盛开迎春花
    哈尔滨、广州大批工厂提前完成元月计划
    据新华社哈尔滨24日电　哈尔滨市到22日统计，已有七百零二个工厂分别提前九天到二十天完成了1月份的生产计划。
    在夺取1月份生产全面红的过程中，哈尔滨工业战线的职工积极响应中共哈尔滨市委提出的“老厂换新装、老兵换新枪、新兵变老兵”的号召，进一步开展技术革新和技术革命运动，并且进而发展为全面的技术改造，使全市工业系统的机械化自动化水平不断提高。据初步统计，1月份全市工业系统的职工共提出合理化建议二十万零两千件，已实现七万五千件，推广先进经验五千三百多项。从去年11月到现在，全市各工厂企业实现了自动化生产线一百四十一条，其中1月份实现的有八十二件；实现单机自动化四百九十台；实现手工操作机械化三千三百十四项，装卸搬运机械化一百八十项。从而使生产效率成倍、成十倍、成百倍地提高，节约了大批劳动力，提高了产品质量，降低了成本。如哈尔滨轴承厂创制成功二○四轴承套圈车加工自动化生产线，工人由二十二人减少到四人，产量提高一倍多，劳动生产率提高十倍。哈尔滨亚麻厂最近实现了短麻运输加湿、联梳并条和漂纱上浆等六条自动化生产线，减少工序二十道，节省机器设备六十八台，节省厂房三千多平方米，取消了八个手工操作的工种，节省劳动力二百六十人，大大提高了生产效率。
    据新华社广州24日电　广州市已有二百一十五家工厂提前完成1月份的生产计划。1月上、中旬，全市的工业平均日产值比去年12月份增长7．8％。
    许多工厂的技术表演赛高潮继续向前发展。捷和钢铁厂轧薄钢板车间加热工段改进了入风和烧煤操作方法，最近连续三次创造建厂以来班产量最高纪录。西区纺织行业在近五天来的技术表演选拔赛当中，涌现出了各种生产标兵七百四十六人，大大推动了当前的生产。
    在争取1月份更多超产的同时，所有工厂都已积极为春节后的生产作好准备。连日来，北区二百三十多家工厂开展了宣传鼓动工作，保证春节生产比元旦更好。南区南方烟厂工人提出春节生产做到出勤、质量、产量、安全、劳动纪律五好。东区许多工厂已下达了2月份的生产计划，发动职工讨论，订措施、提保证，准备春节生产的第一天，举行万人技术表演竞赛。北区各工厂准备利用班前班后休息时间抢修设备，做到既不影响日常生产，又不使机床带病过节。
