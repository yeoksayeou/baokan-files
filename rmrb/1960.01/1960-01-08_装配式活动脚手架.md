    Prefabricated Mobile Scaffolding
    Yan Changqing, a veteran bricklayer at the No. 2 Construction Site of the Harbin No. 2 Construction Engineering Company, with the assistance of engineer Zhao Zhenya, recently successfully created prefabricated mobile scaffolding. This innovation is of great significance for solving the current shortage of scaffolding tools and ensuring the smooth progress of capital construction.

    This scaffolding is made of wood squares, angle iron, and screws. It is flexibly assembled and can be extended or contracted according to the height of the building, suitable for buildings up to twelve meters or three stories. This scaffolding is convenient for loading materials; one end has a material conveying tower that can transport bricks and mortar from the ground to the scaffolding using a winch or vertical transport machinery.

    Using this scaffolding, when a section of the project is completed, power can be used to transfer it to a new construction site, which can save a lot of scaffolding poles and materials such as iron wire and straw rope used to bind the scaffolding.

    装配式活动脚手架
    哈尔滨市第二建筑工程公司二○二工地技术老瓦工阎长清，在工程师赵震亚的帮助下，最近创造成功装配式活动脚手架。这一创造，对于解决当前脚手工具不足、保证基本建设顺利进行有重大意义。
    这种脚手架是用木方子和角铁、螺丝组成的。它装配灵活，能够根据建筑物的高低伸缩，适于建筑十二米以下的三层楼房使用。这种脚手架上料方便，它的一端有运料输送塔，可以将红砖和砂浆由地面用卷扬机或垂直运输机械运到架子上。
    使用这种脚手架，当一段工程完工时，就可用动力转移到新的施工地段，可以节约许多脚手杆和绑扎脚手架所用的铁丝、草绳等材料。
