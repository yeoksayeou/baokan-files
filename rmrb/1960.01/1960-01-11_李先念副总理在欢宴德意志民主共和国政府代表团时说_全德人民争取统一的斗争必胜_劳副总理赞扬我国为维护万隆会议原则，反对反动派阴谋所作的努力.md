Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Vice Premier Li Xiannian held a grand banquet tonight to warmly welcome Vice Premier Heinrich Rau of the German Democratic Republic and his wife, as well as all the distinguished guests of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic he led.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Premier Rau spoke at the banquet (full text on page 4). Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that the Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the German Democratic Republic and the entire German people for the reunification of their motherland on the basis of peace and democracy, and are convinced that their struggle will achieve final victory. Vice Premier Rau said in his speech that the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two Germanys and the resolution of the West Berlin issue, as demanded by the German Democratic Republic, are the most important tasks to be solved in Europe today in order to prevent West German imperialism from launching a new war. Their speeches were received with extremely warm applause.

Present at the banquet were members of the German Democratic Republic government delegation: Paul Verner, Otto Winzer, Paul Wandel and their wives, as well as all the staff of the delegation.

Also present at the banquet were Vice Premiers of the State Council He Long and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Bao Erhan, and others.

The grand banquet began at 7:30 PM. Vice Premier Li Xiannian spoke first at the banquet, expressing warm welcome to the distinguished guests on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people. He said that this visit by the distinguished guests will surely make new contributions to the further development of the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries.

Vice Premier Rau then spoke. He said that the working people of the German Democratic Republic express their great admiration and respect for the great achievements already attained and the new achievements being made every day by the Chinese people in the cause of socialist construction, and for their comprehensive Great Leap Forward movement.

Vice Premier Rau strongly condemned the ruling clique of West Germany for continuing their policies of cold war, atomic weapons, and suppression of all democratic forces.

Vice Premier Rau pointed out that the unremitting efforts made by the Soviet Union to strive for peace, especially the achievements made by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union N.S. Khrushchev during his important visit to the United States, resulted in an understanding regarding the holding of a summit conference. He said that the government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes the convening of the summit conference. However, he also pointed out that achievements can only be made in discussing the German question when German representatives participate.

Vice Premier Rau said, we support one of the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence—the sincere efforts made by the People's Republic of China to uphold the Bandung Conference principles as the basis of relations between countries, and to defend these principles against all conspiracies of the reactionaries. In the face of the recent developments in the situation in Japan, we believe that it is urgently necessary to realize the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Pacific region. This will be a valuable contribution to safeguarding peace in the Far East and Southeast Asia.

Vice Premier He Long also delivered a speech at the banquet. He pointed out that in recent years, the people of the German Democratic Republic have achieved brilliant successes in building socialism, opposing West German militarism, and defending European and world peace. These achievements are the result of the correct leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, headed by Comrade Ulbricht. He proposed a toast to the health of all comrades of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, headed by Comrade Ulbricht.

The banquet proceeded in an atmosphere of friendship and unity from beginning to end. During the banquet, musical workers from the capital played many joyful musical pieces to add to the festivities.

Also present at tonight's banquet were heads of various departments of state organs, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, responsible persons of Beijing Municipality, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

Officials from the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, and diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries in China were also invited to attend the banquet.

    全德人民争取统一的斗争必胜
    劳副总理赞扬我国为维护万隆会议原则，反对反动派阴谋所作的努力
    据新华社10日讯　李先念副总理今晚举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎德意志民主共和国副总理海因里希·劳和他的夫人，以及他所率领的德意志民主共和国政府代表团全体贵宾。
    李先念副总理和劳副总理在宴会上先后讲话（全文见第四版）。李先念副总理说，中国人民全力支持德意志民主共和国和全体德意志人民为争取祖国在和平和民主的基础上达到统一而进行的正义斗争，并且深信，他们的斗争必将取得最后的胜利。劳副总理在讲话中说，德意志民主共和国所要求的同两个德国缔结和约和解决西柏林问题，是欧洲目前应当解决的最重要的任务，以便阻止西德帝国主义发动一次新的战争。他们的讲话受到了极其热烈的欢迎。
    出席宴会的，有德意志民主共和国政府代表团团员：保罗·维尔纳，奥托·文策尔，保罗·汪戴尔和他们的夫人，以及代表团的全体工作人员。
    国务院副总理贺龙、习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉等人也出席了宴会。
    盛大的宴会在七时半开始。李先念副总理在宴会上首先讲话，他代表中国政府和中国人民向贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。他说，贵宾们的这一次访问必将对我们两国的友好和合作关系的进一步发展作出新的贡献。
    劳副总理接着讲话。他说，德意志民主共和国劳动人民对中国人民在社会主义建设事业中已经获得的伟大成就和每天正在取得的新成就，对他们的全面的大跃进运动表示十分赞扬和钦佩。
    劳副总理强烈地谴责西德的统治集团继续他们的冷战、原子武器和压迫一切民主力量的政策。
    劳副总理指出，苏联为争取和平所作的不懈努力，特别是苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在美国进行重要访问所取得的成就，就是对举行一次最高级会议一事取得了谅解。他说，德意志民主共和国政府欢迎最高级会议的召开。但是，他同时指出，只有在德国代表参加的情况下，讨论德国问题才能取得成就。
    劳副总理说，我们支持和平共处五项原则的创议者之一——中华人民共和国为维护万隆会议原则作为各国之间关系的基础，以及为保卫这些原则反对反动派的一切阴谋而作的真诚的努力。面对着最近日本局势的发展，我们认为急需实现在太平洋地区建立无原子武器地区的建议。这对于保障远东和东南亚的和平将是一个宝贵的贡献。
    贺龙副总理也在宴会上致词。他指出，几年来，德意志民主共和国人民在建设社会主义，反对西德军国主义以及保卫欧洲和世界和平的斗争中取得了辉煌的成就。这些成就是富有革命传统的德国统一社会党正确领导的结果。他提议，为以乌布利希同志为首的德国统一社会党中央委员会全体同志们的健康干杯。
    宴会自始至终都在友谊团结的气氛中进行，席间，首都的音乐工作者演奏了许多欢乐的乐曲助兴。
    出席今晚宴会的，还有国家机关各部门负责人，中国人民解放军高级将领，北京市的负责人和首都各方面的人士。
