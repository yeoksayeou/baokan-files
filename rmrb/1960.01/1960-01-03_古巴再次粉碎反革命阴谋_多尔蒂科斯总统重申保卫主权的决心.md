Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 29th: On the eve of the first anniversary of the Cuban Revolution, the Cuban government and armed forces once again crushed a counter-revolutionary conspiracy by enemies at home and abroad.

According to today's "Revolución" newspaper, the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces Investigation Bureau arrested twenty-five conspirators who arrived by small boat on Salt Island near Cuba. The ringleaders of these conspirators were Sosa Charbaud, the former president of "Diario de la Marina," a loyal mouthpiece of feudal and imperialist forces, and a large plantation owner, and Arburque Tamayo, a former captain of the dictatorship regime. They were preparing to fly to Miami to receive weapons for rebellion activities. These conspiracies echoed the invasion activities being prepared by monopoly groups in certain Caribbean countries.

The Revolutionary Armed Forces Investigation Bureau also arrested nine members of another counter-revolutionary group who had gone to Miami to collect explosives. Documents seized by the Revolutionary Armed Forces Investigation Bureau proved that the Dominican dictator participated in the plan to invade Cuba. At the same time, government authorities also seized two speedboats carrying counter-revolutionary fugitives and transporting weapons.

The news of these conspiracies to sabotage the Cuban Revolution has heightened the vigilance of the Cuban people, who are mobilizing to defend the revolution.

Currently, militias are being organized and military training is being carried out throughout the country. Militia organizations have been established in all 426 cooperatives nationwide. Guards have been established by almost all sugar factory workers to prevent sabotage of production.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, December 28th: Cuban President Dorticós said in a televised speech today, when talking about relations between Cuba and the United States, that Cuba will continue to steadfastly defend its sovereignty. He said that the prospects for relations between Cuba and the United States depend on the attitude taken by the United States government. Cuba has not invaded anyone, but is a country that has been invaded.

Dorticós reiterated that the sugar quota in the United States market should no longer be unilaterally determined by the United States as in the past, but should be determined through bilateral treaties. He emphasized that the Cuban government believes that continuing to maintain this situation is not a friendly act. Dorticós also condemned the United States for obstructing Britain and other countries from selling aircraft necessary for Cuba's defense.

Referring to the anti-Cuban counter-revolutionary rebellion instigated by American monopoly organizations from some countries in the Caribbean Sea, Dorticós said that the Organization of American States has not fulfilled its obligations, but is "serving those forces that are opposed to the people."

Finally, Dorticós spoke of land reform and other achievements of the revolutionary government over the past year. He said that he is convinced that the people, together with the Rebel Army, will certainly be able to crush any aggression against Cuba.

    古巴再次粉碎反革命阴谋
    多尔蒂科斯总统重申保卫主权的决心
    新华社哈瓦那12月29日电　在古巴革命一周年的前夕，古巴政府和武装部队再一次粉碎了国内外敌人的反革命阴谋。
    据今天的“革命报”报道，古巴革命武装部调查局逮捕了二十五个乘小艇到古巴附近的萨耳特岛的阴谋者。这些阴谋分子的头目是封建和帝国主义势力的忠实喉舌、“海洋日报”的前社长、大庄园主索萨·查耳包德和前独裁政权的上尉阿耳武尔克·塔马约。他们准备乘飞机到迈阿密去领取进行叛乱活动的武器。这些阴谋活动与垄断集团在加勒比某些国家准备的入侵活动相呼应。
    革命武装部调查局还逮捕了到迈阿密去领取炸药的另一个反革命集团的九个成员。革命武装部调查局缴获的文件证明，多米尼加独裁者参加了入侵古巴的计划。同时，政府当局还缴获了两艘载运反革命逃犯和运输武器的快艇。
    这些阴谋破坏古巴革命的消息使古巴人民提高了警惕，并正在动员起来保卫革命。
    目前，全国各地都在组织民兵和开展军事训练。全国四百二十六个合作社都成立了民兵组织。几乎所有蔗糖厂的工人都建立了警卫队，以防止对生产的破坏。
    新华社哈瓦那12月28日电　古巴总统多尔蒂科斯今天在电视演说中谈到古巴和美国的关系时说，古巴将继续坚定不移地保卫自己的主权。他说，古巴和美国的关系的前景取决于美国政府所采取的态度。古巴没有侵略任何人，而是遭到侵略的国家。
    多尔蒂科斯重申美国市场上食糖定额不应再像过去那样由美国片面决定，而应通过双边条约来确定。他强调指出，古巴政府认为，继续保持这种状况不是友好的行为。多尔蒂科斯还谴责美国阻挠英国和其他国家卖给古巴国防必要的飞机。
    在谈到美国垄断组织策动的从加勒比海一些国家进行反古巴的反革命叛乱时，多尔蒂科斯说，美洲国家组织没有履行它所承担的义务，而是为“那些与人民对立的势力效劳。”
    多尔蒂科斯最后谈到土地改革和革命政府一年来的其他成就。他说，他确信，人民和起义军一起，一定能粉碎对古巴进行的任何侵略。
