A Family in the Commune
Zhang Zhimin, poem
Miao Di, Illustration

Old Man Xichun is seventy-three this year, nicknamed "Old Youth."
With a hoe and a sickle, he's busy from dawn till dusk.
Husking rice in the mill, grinding flour in the shed.
An un-elected head of the family, he takes charge wherever there's work.
He'd rather break his arm than bend the truth.
That day at the well, debating past and present, he argued red-faced with Mancang.
"You say the food in the canteen isn't fragrant, I say every day is like the New Year.
You feel listless, I feel energy bursting forth.
Speaking of now, compared to before, did *you* work hard? Did *we* work hard?
You had bins full of white rice and bins full of flour, we only had two empty bowls.
What kind of smoke comes from what kind of chimney, an old kite can't hatch a phoenix..."
He stood up straight, clutching his pipe, and Mancang lowered his head, slinking into the corner.

Xichun's father is the production team leader, a commune member.
If there's something to discuss, find him in the fields; you won't find him at home.
He's an expert at farming, a "top scholar" in achieving high yields.
In his hands, the land is like a lump of dough.
Pinch a channel, and it's a channel; carve a dam, and it's a dam.
Neighboring communes come to learn, asking him about his experience.
"You've been tilling rocky land for half your life, how did you learn to manage these several acres of fields?"
He smiled and took a puff of smoke.
"There are ten thousand reasons, but the most important are two:
Before, we were short-sighted and narrow-minded; now, we're clear-eyed and broad-minded.
Back then, we only had to fill the mouths of my wife and kids; now we are filled with the socialist general line..."

Xichun's mother is a model mother-in-law, a model mother, a model feeder, with three big red flowers.
Some say the red flowers lack one, that her education is not "up to par."
Her man worries for her, her daughter-in-law teaches her by hand.
Last night, after dark and everyone was asleep, she was still sitting under the oil lamp.
Writing and drawing.
Xichun quietly came to see, unable to suppress a chuckle.
"Mom! Are you writing characters or tracing them? The characters are as big as walnuts..."
Who knew that Mom was writing a book, to report her pig-raising methods to Chairman Mao.
She writes about how to mix feed, how to build pigsties.
How to fatten pigs, how to raise piglets.
"Go to sleep! Don't mind me! A good article isn't afraid of poor writing.
If we use the characters to compare with our pigs, even the smallest should be the size of a calf..."

Xichun's wife, the joy of her recent marriage still lingers on her brows, only two months ago she was still a girl.
It was she who broke old customs and established new ones, creating new rules for the girls.
To compete with Xichun in steelmaking, she made a vow at the mass meeting.
Competing fiercely, pushing each other forward, neither ahead nor behind.
Advancing side by side, supporting each other, two red flags planted opposite each other.
One battlefield recognizes heroes, one battlefield recruits "sons-in-law", blast furnaces everywhere are wedding candles, red flag medals are symbols of unity.
Everyone admires her, everyone praises her.
Grandpa and father-in-law can't praise her enough, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are as close as mother and daughter.
This morning, she is both shy and smiling, what is she going to say to her mother-in-law?
"Daughter! Could it be you have some good news? Tell me quickly, Mom..."
"No! Mom! It, it's that my application to join the Party has been approved!"

Xichun, a blue work uniform, a white towel.
Wherever there is difficulty, he goes, leading the charge in the south and north.
Some say he is "Little Nezha," with fire wheels under his feet.
Building reservoirs, he is an engineer, understanding geology and hydrology.
Building pastures, he is the commander-in-chief, raising cattle and sheep knowledgeably.
He can compile reports, write poems, act in plays, and play the qin.
A multi-talented all-rounder, a new generation.
His specialty is greening, having studied horticulture at agricultural school.
Last year, he created early-ripening apricots, this spring, he created fragrant wind forests.
In one year he has traveled the road of ten years, a hundred acres of orchard in all seasons.
Now what is he busy with day and night?
He is breaking the superstition of the conservatives...

    公社一家人
    张志民　诗苗地　插图
    喜春爷交年七十三，外号“老青年”。一把锄头一张镰，终天到晚不知闲。碾房里说米，磨棚里谈面。没经选举的当家人，哪处儿有事哪处管。宁让胳膊折，不许理儿弯。那日井台论古今，他跟满仓争红脸。“你说食堂饭不香，我说天天过大年。“你觉混身没得劲，我觉劲儿使不完。“说现在，论从前，你?干？咱?干？“你大囤白米小囤面，咱只有两只空饭碗。“什么样烟囱冒什么气，老鹞子下不出凤凰蛋……”他攥着烟杆挺身站，满仓低头搭脑墙角钻。
    喜春爹生产队长，公社委员。有事田头找，家里碰不见。论庄稼他是把式，搞丰产他是“状元”。土地放在他手里，好似一块面团团。捏条渠是渠，掐道堰是堰。邻社来取经，请他谈经验。“你刨种半辈子乱石岗，怎学会经营这几顷田？”他笑一笑，吸了口烟。“要摆道理有千万条，最要紧的有两点：“早先咱眼短肚又窄，如今咱眼明心又宽。“那时只装着老婆孩子三张嘴如今装的是社会主义总路线……”
    喜春妈模范婆婆，模范妈妈，模范饲养员，三朵大红花。有人说红花还缺一朵，说她文化还“不到家”。男人为她起急，媳妇掰手儿教她。昨晚天黑人睡定，她还坐在油灯下。又是写，又是画。喜春悄悄赶来瞧，不由暗把笑声发。“妈呀！是写生字是写仿？字儿都有核桃大……”哪知妈妈正著书，要向毛主席汇报她养猪法。她写饲料?个配，她写猪舍?个搭。怎样喂肥猪，如何带猪娃。“睡去吧！别管妈！好文章可不怕字儿差。“要用字儿比咱的猪，顶小的也该有牛犊儿大
    ……”
    喜春妻新婚喜气仍在眉梢挂，两月前还是个女孩儿家。就是她打破陈规立新俗，为姑娘们开创了新章法。为跟喜春比炼钢，群众会上把誓发。你争我夺不相让，前追后赶不上下。齐头并进双扶助，两杆红旗对面插。一个战场认英雄，一个阵前招“驸马”，遍地高炉是鸾凤烛，红旗奖章是同心花。人人慕，个个夸。爷爷、公公喜不够，婆媳俩亲似母女俩。今早她含羞又带笑，要对婆婆说啥话？“闺女呀！莫非你有了喜？快快儿告诉妈……”“不！妈妈！是，是，入党申请书批准啦！”
    喜春一条蓝?布，一块白头巾。哪有困难到哪去，南征北战打头阵。有人说他“小哪吒”脚下踩着风火轮。修水库他是工程师，懂得地质识水文。建牧场他是总指挥，养牛养羊有学问。会编报、会写诗，会演戏、会拉琴。多面巧手，一代新人。最拿手的是搞绿化，农业学校学过园林。去年创造早熟杏，今春创造香风林。一年他走完了十年的路，百亩果园四季春。如今他日夜忙什么？正给保守派破迷信……
