    Xili Agricultural Middle School Widely Establishes Technical Courses
    Students Learn Both Cultural Knowledge and Master Agricultural Technology
    (Our report) Gansu Province's Xili County agricultural middle schools are gradually moving towards consolidation and improvement. Students are learning both cultural knowledge and agricultural technology, cultivating technical talent for the communes.
    In 1958, with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, Xili County established six agricultural middle schools with 392 students. Each agricultural middle school, based on local conditions, generally set up a specialized technical course to be able to supply a large number of agricultural technicians to the communes in a short period. For example, the Honghe Agricultural Middle School, based on local needs, established a water conservancy specialty course. On the principle of using construction sites as classrooms and real objects as teaching materials, thirty-seven students were selected and dispatched to key water conservancy construction sites such as Huangjiang and Kunlun to assist in simple engineering design and surveying work, solving the difficulty of insufficient technical personnel, and was welcomed by the masses. The Taoping Agricultural Middle School, based on the local characteristics suitable for the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, established a animal husbandry specialty course, adopting the method of learning while teaching and learning while doing. Most students have learned to treat epidemic diseases of livestock and pigs.
    Due to the implementation of the Party's educational policy, students in agricultural middle schools have generally achieved a triple harvest in ideology, learning, and labor. Before enrolling, although some students' levels were not up to the standard of senior primary school, under their hard work and the teachers' careful teaching, the quality of the main subjects such as politics, Chinese, and mathematics generally reached the requirements of ordinary middle schools. For example, in the term test last year at the Nanyu Agricultural Middle School, students with an average score of over 80 in each subject accounted for more than 60%. The achievements in productive labor are even more significant. The Nanshan Agricultural Middle School has reclaimed more than 120 mu of wasteland, an average of more than two mu per person; this year's planting of more than 40 mu of buckwheat, oats, potatoes, and vegetables has yielded a great harvest. The 22 mu of rhubarb averaged 2,445 jin of fresh produce per mu, which is twice as high as the local average yield, and one high-yield field reached 3,078 jin. All the agricultural middle schools in Xili County have established a production labor base - a farm, with an average of about one mu of land per person. At the same time, the agricultural middle schools, in conjunction with learning courses, carry out sideline production and have built breeding farms. With the increase in agricultural and sideline income, these schools have generally achieved self-sufficiency, and students' living expenses, teachers' salaries, and office expenses can be solved by themselves. Some schools even have surpluses. For example, the Shangping Agricultural Middle School has built pig, bee, brick and tile, lime, and flour processing plants (factories). Last year's sideline income alone reached 19,800 yuan, an average income of more than 177 yuan per person. In addition to supplying students with food, each student can also be given about one yuan of pocket money per month. (Attached picture)

    西礼农业中学遍设技术课程
    学员既学到了文化知识又掌握了农业技术
    本报讯　甘肃省西礼县各农业中学正逐步走向巩固健全的道路，学生既学到文化知识又学到农业技术，为公社培养了技术人材。
    西礼县在1958年里，随着工农业生产的大跃进，先后办起了六所农业中学，有学生三百九十二名。各农业中学根据本地具体情况，普遍设有一项专业技术课程，以便在短期内，能够更多地为公社输送大批农业技术人员。如红河农业中学根据当地需要，设立了水利专业课，在以工地为课堂，实物做教材的原则下，为配合当前农田水利基本建设，抽调三十七名学生分赴黄江、昆仑等重点水利工地，帮助做简单的工程设计和测量工作，解决了技术人员不足的困难，受到了群众的欢迎。洮坪农业中学根据当地适宜农、林、牧、副、渔多种经营全面发展的特点，设立了畜牧专业课程，采取边教边学，边做边学的办法，大部分学生已学会了给牲畜、生猪治疗疫病。
    各农业中学，由于贯彻执行了党的教育方针，使学生普遍获得了思想、学习、劳动三丰收。各地农业中学的学生在入学前，尽管有部分程度尚不足高小，但在他们刻苦学习和教师认真教导下，所学的政治、语文、数学等主要学科的质量，一般都基本达到了普通中学的要求。如南峪农业中学在去年学期测验中，各门功课平均在八十分以上的学生，就占60％以上。在生产劳动方面，各学校所取得的成绩更是显著。南山农业中学已开荒一百二十多亩，每人平均两亩多；今年种植的四十多亩荞麦、燕麦、洋芋和蔬菜等，都获得了大丰收。二十二亩大黄平均亩产鲜货两千四百四十五斤，比当地一般产量高两倍，其中一亩高产田达到了三千零七十八斤。西礼县所有的农业中学，都建立了生产劳动的基地——农场，一般每人平均种地一亩左右。同时，各农业中学结合学习课程，进行副业生产，建起了饲养场等。随着农副业收入的增加，现在这些学校普遍达到了自给，学生生活费、教师工资、办公费等都可自行解决，有的学校还有节余。如上坪农业中学已建起猪、蜂、砖瓦、石灰、面粉加工等场（厂），仅去年的副业收入就达一万九千八百多元，每人平均收入一百七十七元多，除供给学生伙食外，每月还能给每个学生发一元左右的零用钱。（附图片）
