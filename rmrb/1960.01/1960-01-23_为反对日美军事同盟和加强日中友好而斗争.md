    Striving to Oppose the Japan-U.S. Military Alliance and Strengthen Sino-Japanese Friendship
    Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Matsumoto Jiichiro
    Since forming his cabinet in February 1957, Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi has consistently pursued a shameful policy of hostility toward China and has followed the United States in attempting to expand into Southeast Asia. Recently, he signed a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in Washington, taking China as a hypothetical enemy and opening the way for the nuclear armament of Japan's "Self-Defense Forces." Needless to say, this treaty will provoke strong dissatisfaction among the Japanese people even before it is ratified by the Diet. Peace-loving Japanese people will launch a thorough struggle to resolutely prevent its ratification by the Diet. Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi is fully aware of the opposition of the broad masses of the Japanese people, yet he has gone ahead and done such a thing, which on the one hand shows that the United States' Far East policy still adopts the basic policy of continuing the "Cold War," and on the other hand, exposes that the reactionary forces centered on Nobusuke Kishi are preparing to revive Japanese militarism, side with the U.S. war policy, and carry out its shameful actions.
    Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi has stated more than once that he does not want to be hostile to China. However, the U.S. imperialist policy of hostility towards New China is a well-known fact. Signing a new treaty of "joint cooperation" with the United States cannot but be said to be a more blatant manifestation of the Kishi Nobusuke government's consistent policy of hostility towards China. The exchanges and trade between the peoples of Japan and China, which the Japanese people have opened up with the support of China in various aspects over the past few years, were already damaged by Kishi Nobusuke's policies the year before last. The revision of the "Security Treaty" obviously gives a serious blow to the Japanese people who are committed to opening up this extremely abnormal Sino-Japanese relationship. Although the exchanges between the peoples of Japan and China have been severely restricted by the obstruction of the Kishi Nobusuke government in the past two years, during these two years, the call for Sino-Japanese friendship among the Japanese people has gained increasingly wide support. Japanese industry has tended to expand equipment and increase production in the past two years. In this way, Japan's economic dependence on foreign markets has rapidly increased. In particular, the Japanese people, who are excited about the great construction of neighboring China, are increasingly convinced that only the friendly cooperation between the peoples of Japan and China can guarantee Asian peace and Japanese prosperity.
    The Japan-China Friendship Association organized a preparatory committee immediately after the founding of the People's Republic of China, and it has been ten years since the inaugural meeting was held in October 1950. During this period, it has promoted the cause of promoting friendship between the peoples of the two countries. There is no doubt that many of our activities have been carried out with the friendly support of Chinese people's organizations, mainly the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. However, this is based on the ardent desire of the Japanese people who long for peace and Sino-Japanese friendship, and has increasingly gained the support of the broad masses of the people. At first, our movement wanted to unite people from all walks of life who yearned for Sino-Japanese friendship, so we did not focus on politics but on promoting cultural and economic exchanges. However, since the Kishi Nobusuke government destroyed the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement in May 1958, we have focused our activities on opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China. Since last year, we have been opposing the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which specifically embodies the policy of hostility towards China, from the front. In this process, some conservative people who had joined our association left the association. But on the other hand, the activities of the association have gradually and victoriously penetrated into the working masses. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we conducted extensive nationwide publicity activities from September to November, enhanced the people's understanding of New China, and expanded the battle line against the revision of the "Security Treaty." In the joint struggle organizations in various places to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," the county-level organizations of our association have played an important role.
    Recently, some leading cadres of the Liberal Democratic Party, under the pressure of the people's demand for the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, have begun to say that they want to open up Sino-Japanese relations, and promote the revision of the "Security Treaty" as if it goes hand in hand with the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. This certainly reflects the precursor to the intensification of internal contradictions within the Conservative Party on China policy. However, the fundamental thing is that they are painstakingly trying to win the trust of the people in order to forcibly revise the "Security Treaty." Regarding such propaganda, we have already issued a statement on January 12 calling on the people as a link in the eleventh unified action to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty." At the national worker meeting of our association held on January 15 and 16, a resolution was also adopted to fight against such deceptive propaganda. At this workers' meeting, we also decided to launch more powerful activities to prevent the ratification of the new treaty.
    The new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is not only strengthening the Japan-U.S. military alliance, but also accelerating the revival of Japanese militarism. It is a signal of fascist attack on the Japanese people who demand independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality. However, we know that the world in the 1960s is completely different from the era in which the military alliance of Japan, Germany, and Italy existed. As Chairman Mao Zedong clearly pointed out, the current world is a world where "the East wind prevails over the West wind." The Japanese people, standing on the basis of reflecting on the past war of aggression, have embarked on the road of uniting all peace forces and uniting the broad masses of the people into a united front. We are determined to fight to strengthen the united front for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality, and to realize the people's desire for the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

### 为反对日美军事同盟和加强日中友好而斗争

    为反对日美军事同盟和加强日中友好而斗争
    日中友好协会会长　松本治一郎
    岸信介首相自从1957年2月组织内阁以来，一贯推行可耻的敌视中国的政策，并且追随美国企图向东南亚扩张。最近在华盛顿签署新的日美“安全条约”，以中国为假想敌国，为日本“自卫队”的核武装开辟道路。不消说，这一条约在国会批准之前更将激起日本人民强烈的不满。爱好和平的日本人民为了坚决阻止国会的批准，要展开彻底的斗争。岸信介首相明知道广大日本国民的反对而竟然干出这样的事情，一方面表明美国的远东政策仍然采取继续“冷战”的基本方针，另一方面暴露了以岸信介为中心的反动势力准备复活日本军国主义，投靠美国战争政策，进行它的可耻行动。
    岸信介首相到现在为止，不止一次地表明它不想敌视中国。但是，美帝国主义的敌视新中国政策是世所周知的事实。同美国签订“共同合作”的新条约，不能不说是岸信介政府一贯执行敌视中国政策的更露骨的表现。几年来，日本人民在中国的各方面支援下所开辟的日中两国人民之间的交流和贸易，已经在前年为岸信介的政策所破坏。修改“安全条约”，显然给致力于打开这种极不正常的日中关系的日本人民以严重的打击。最近两年来，日中两国人民的交流虽然因岸信介政府的阻挠而受到严重的限制；但在这两年间，在日本人民当中要求日中友好的呼声，却越来越得到广泛的拥护。日本工业在这两年来趋向于扩充设备、增加生产。这样，日本经济对国外市场的依赖迅速增大。尤其是对于邻邦中国的伟大建设感到兴奋的日本国民愈加确信，只有日中两国人民的友好合作才能保障亚洲和平和日本的繁荣。
    日中友好协会，在中华人民共和国成立后随即组织了筹备会，从1950年10月举行创立大会以来已经十年，在这期间内，推行促进两国人民友好的事业。毫无疑义，我们许多活动，是在以中国人民对外文化协会为主的中国人民团体的友好的声援之下进行的。但是，这是以渴望和平和日中友好的日本人民热烈的愿望为基础，日益获得了广大国民的拥护。起初，我们的运动是想团结所有渴望日中友好的各阶层人士，所以没有把重点放在政治而是放在促进文化、经济交流这一方面。但是，从岸信介政府1958年5月破坏第四次日中贸易协定以后，我们就把活动的重点放在反对岸信介政府敌视中国政策上面。从去年以来，更从正面反对具体表现敌视中国政策的修改日美“安全条约”的行动。在这一过程中，出现了加入我们协会的一部分保守党人脱离协会的现象。但是另一面，协会的活动，逐渐胜利地深入于劳动群众之中。在中华人民共和国成立十周年的时候，我们从9月到11月进行全国性的广泛宣传活动，增进了国民对新中国的理解，扩大了反对修改“安全条约”的斗争战线。在阻止修改“安全条约”的各地方共同斗争组织中，我们协会的县单位组织，都起了重要的作用。
    最近，自由民主党的一些领导干部，为国民要求日中关系正常化的呼声所迫，开始说想要打开日中关系，宣传修改“安全条约”好像和日中关系的正常化并行不悖。这固然反映了在对中国政策上保守党内部对立激化的预兆。但是，基本的是他们为了强行修改“安全条约”，而在处心积虑地骗取国民的信任。对这样的宣传，我们已经在1月12日发表声明向国民呼吁，作为阻止修改“安全条约”的第十一次统一行动的一个环节。在1月15日、16日两天召开的我们协会全国工作者会议上，也通过了同这样欺骗宣传进行斗争的决议。在这次工作者会议上，我们还决定为阻止批准新的条约而展开更强有力的活动。
    新的日美“安全条约”，不仅是加强日美军事同盟，而且是加速复活日本军国主义，是对要求独立、和平、民主、中立的日本人民进行法西斯进攻的信号。但是，我们知道二十世纪六十年代的世界，完全不同于日德意军事同盟所存在的时代。正像毛泽东主席所明确指出的，现在的世界是“东风压倒西风”的世界。日本人民站在反省过去侵略战争的基础上，走上团结一切和平力量、团结广大国民的统一战线的道路。我们决心为了加强争取和平、独立、民主、中立的统一战线，为了实现国民热望日中关系正常化的要求而进行斗争。　（本报特约稿）
