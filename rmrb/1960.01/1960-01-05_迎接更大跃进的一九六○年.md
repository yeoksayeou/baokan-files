    Ushering in a Greater Leap Forward in 1960
    Yang Shangkui, First Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    1959 has passed, and the new year of 1960 has arrived.
    1959 was a year in which Jiangxi Province's national economy continued to leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Like the rest of the country, the people of the province, with soaring revolutionary vigor and selfless labor, completed the state plan ahead of schedule, in greater quantities, at a faster pace, with better quality, and more economically. The entire national economy, whether in industry, agriculture, transportation, capital construction, finance and trade, or scientific, cultural, and health undertakings, presented a scene of thriving prosperity. The material and cultural lives of the people have also been correspondingly improved and elevated.
    Now, the year 1960, which lies before the people of Jiangxi Province, is another year of new and significant importance. In 1960, it is necessary to continue to implement the anti-rightist campaign, boost morale, and strive to achieve a greater leap forward in the national economy on the basis of the continued leap forward in 1959.
    The tasks for 1960 are very glorious and even more arduous. With the rapid increase in the economic base, each 1% increase in the output value of the national economy on this basis represents a larger absolute amount. On the road to leapfrog advancement, due to the acceleration of speed and the increase in tasks, some new problems and new difficulties will naturally arise, such as the contradiction between the increased tasks and the labor force; the contradiction between capital construction and the supply of raw materials and materials; the contradiction between the volume of transport and the transport capacity; and so on. It is one-sided and wrong to only see the difficult side of the national economic upsurge without seeing the dominant favorable conditions for overcoming these difficulties, because the objective possibility of realizing a greater leap forward in 1960 is fully available. First, with the thorough implementation of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Eighth Plenary Session of the Fifth Jiangxi Provincial Committee, the political enthusiasm and production initiative of the vast number of cadres and the masses have been greatly increased. Second, the people's communes have been further consolidated and can better exert their vigorous vitality and unparalleled superiority. Third, there are more favorable conditions for a greater leap forward in industry. After the construction of the first five-year plan and the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, industry has made great progress. In the past, the iron and steel industry, chemical industry, cement industry...etc., which were almost blank on the paper of Jiangxi Province, have now been painted with beautiful pictures. The machinery manufacturing industry, electrical machinery manufacturing industry, etc., which used to have simple equipment and outdated machines, have been newly armed. Fourth, the transportation, finance and trade, science, culture, education, and health departments of the national economy have, after several years of development, have greater strength to serve the greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.
    To overcome the difficulties in the course of advancement, transform objective possibilities into realities, and realize the greater leap forward in 1960, it is necessary to resolutely implement the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and a whole set of policies of "walking on two legs." This general line gives full play to the subjective initiative of the people, correctly reflects the objective economic laws and the greatest interests and urgent needs of the people. The Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward in 1959 prove that this general line is completely correct. This general line is a lighthouse illuminating the progress of all work. If we deviate from this general line in our actual work, we will inevitably make "left" or right mistakes. To implement the general line and a whole set of policies of "walking on two legs," the most fundamental thing is to implement the policy of "developing industry must be carried out simultaneously with the development of agriculture." Because agriculture and industry are the two most basic legs of the national economy and the two most basic material production sectors. These two major sectors are combined, mutually conditional, and mutually promoted. With the leap forward of these two major departments, the great leap forward of the entire national economy, including the great leap forward of science and culture, will be reliably guaranteed. In implementing the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, we must ensure that industry strongly supports agriculture and first guarantees the great leap forward in agriculture, because agriculture is the foundation and basic point of the entire national economy. Guaranteeing the great leap forward in agriculture first will not hinder the development of industry; on the contrary, it will continue to promote the continuous great leap forward of industry. Because first guaranteeing the great leap forward in agriculture will provide industry with more and more labor, more and more grain and raw materials, more and more construction funds, and an increasingly broad market. Therefore, the great leap forward in agriculture will actively promote the great leap forward in industry. In implementing the policy of developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously, our emphasis on first guaranteeing the great leap forward in agriculture also lies in making the entire national economy develop in a coordinated, proportional, and high-speed manner. Developing the national economy in a planned and proportional manner is the law of development of the socialist economy. Among the various proportional relationships of the national economy, the most basic is to maintain the proportional relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry, which is the proportional relationship between the two major categories of means of production and means of consumption. If the proportional relationship between them can develop in a coordinated and balanced manner, the national economy can leap forward at a high speed. In view of the fact that the development of agriculture is more restricted by natural conditions, especially when we cannot completely resist particularly severe natural disasters at present, we should pay great attention to it, which is required by the laws of socialist economic construction. In order to first ensure the great leap forward in agriculture, industry must vigorously support agriculture, gradually eliminate the differences between workers and peasants, the differences between urban and rural areas, and make the worker-peasant alliance not only politically, but also on a new economic foundation, more consolidated. For industry to vigorously support agriculture, it must develop industry itself.
    To better implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, and realize the greater leap forward in 1960, it is necessary to further strengthen the Party's leadership and fully develop the ideological style and working methods that embody the spirit of the general line. To this end, first of all, we must adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously launch mass movements. The mass movements of socialist construction led by our Party have proven to be invincible and invincible by the experience of the Great Leap Forward in the past two years. To make this kind of mass movement form a climax and develop sustainably, we must continuously strengthen the Party's leadership. We must see that although right-leaning thoughts, right-leaning emotions, and right-leaning activities have been basically overcome at present, they have not been completely eliminated; especially in the face of greater leap forward tasks, some people do not see the favorable conditions, overemphasize difficulties, exaggerate shortcomings, and show fear of difficulties and insufficient enthusiasm; some do not pay attention to local and small-scale initiatives when implementing the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods. Therefore, we must further carry out the ideological struggle of the two construction lines and constantly criticize the right-leaning conservative thoughts that appear on the road to the leap forward, so as to ensure the implementation of the general line.
    Secondly, we must vigorously launch mass socialist labor competitions. Carrying out socialist labor competitions is the best way to extensively mobilize the production enthusiasm of the masses, fully develop the pioneering spirit and communist style of the masses. Now, whether in rural areas, factories, mines, enterprises, schools, organs, or troops, a competition movement of "establishing pacesetters, learning from pacesetters, catching up with pacesetters, and surpassing pacesetters" is surging up. Practice has proven that this is a better form of competition because it has clear banners and concentrated goals. All fronts in the province must develop this form of competition more deeply and more sustainably. In leading this kind of competition, all cadres must not only be good at making the advanced more advanced and making the backward catch up with the advanced; but also be good at discovering new pacesetters emerging in the movement. Because in the competition movement of catching up with each other to seize the upper reaches and strive for advancement, pacesetters are not fixed or immutable. If we discover new pacesetters, we should foster them, support them, and actively help them grow and strengthen with a warm attitude. Only by continuously improving the original pacesetters or establishing new pacesetters can we continuously improve the level of competition and make the competition continue to surge. In extensively carrying out socialist labor competitions, we must also vigorously carry out the movement of advanced helping the backward, and transforming the production level of advanced producers into the social level.
    Thirdly, we must vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. This is also the central content of vigorously launching mass movements and vigorously carrying out socialist labor competitions. The importance of technical innovation and technical revolution has been increasingly recognized by people in practice with the continuous Great Leap Forward of production. This is to combine revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific spirit, combine soaring enthusiasm with ingenuity, combine labor and rest rhythmically, develop quantity, improve quality, reduce costs, ensure safety, and realize the Great Leap Forward with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The urgency of technical innovation and technical revolution has also been increasingly understood by people with the continuous Great Leap Forward of production. Because agriculture needs to leap forward to a greater extent, industry needs to leap forward to a greater extent, and other sectors of the national economy need to leap forward to a greater extent, all of which require greatly improving labor productivity. To improve labor productivity, if we do not actively carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, but rely solely on giving play to the labor enthusiasm of the masses, improving labor organization, or even relying on extending working hours and increasing labor intensity, although we can still tap a certain potential, it is limited and unsustainable, which is far from meeting the requirements of a greater leap forward in the national economy. The fundamental way to greatly improve labor productivity is to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, which is also a decisive link to infinitely improve labor productivity with the existing manpower and realize a continuous Great Leap Forward. To vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, we must implement the policy of "walking on two legs" with indigenous and foreign methods. This should be the case in industry, agriculture, and transportation. We must never simply carry out technical revolution or rely on technical revolution and relax technical innovation. On the contrary, we must first vigorously carry out technical innovation, because modernization can only be gradually realized, and cannot be achieved overnight. At the same time, the continuous progress of technology is a law from indigenous to foreign, from small to large. To vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, we must boldly mobilize the masses and test everything. New inventions and creations, after appraisal, are actually feasible, and should be immediately promoted to achieve widespread adoption. To mobilize the masses to create and invent, we must not only encircle and attack the key to production, but also accelerate the technical innovation and technical revolution of the entire production process. At present, on various fronts in our province, whether for the key to production or the entire production process, there are many major technical reform achievements, such as the "Jiangxi 59 Model Paddy Field Rice Transplanter" successfully trial-produced by the Jiangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences; the all-soil mechanized construction of Fengcheng Ziyunshan Reservoir; the experience of the Jiangxi Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau in summarizing and promoting the combination of indigenous and foreign methods in capital construction construction and installation, implementing "five-izations" (horizontal transportation vehicleization, vertical transportation winchization, universal improvement of tools, component prefabrication factoryization, construction and installation mechanization), etc. Seriously promoting these successful technical achievements, and continuing to boldly mobilize the masses to carry out creative inventions, will surely greatly improve labor productivity, and will surely provide a technical guarantee for the realization of this year's greater leap forward.
    Finally, we must further strengthen the Party's organizational leadership. Strengthening the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for realizing a continuous Great Leap Forward. Grasping both politics and the economy; grasping both key points and taking into account the overall situation; doing a good job in both production and life; vigorously launching mass movements and doing a good job in combining work and rest; and formulating plans that are both active and prudent and reliable are the fundamental experiences of our leadership in the Great Leap Forward. In realizing the greater leap forward in 1960, we must further carry forward and develop them. All regions, departments, and even all grassroots units must, under the guidance of implementing a chess game, formulate their own greater leap forward plans as early as possible and quickly submit them to the masses for extensive discussion, so as to mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses as early as possible. Attention should be paid to preventing the phenomenon of plans being too low and layers of extra load, so as to better plan, better organize, and better arrange the Great Leap Forward plan for 1960. All work must be arranged and deployed from the perspective of actively promoting a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, especially agricultural production. All departments must also plan their own development and arrange their own work from the perspective of promoting a Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. The leadership must not only focus on plans, but also pay attention to inspection, do a good job in active balancing work, and achieve step-by-step implementation, so as to make the entire national economy develop at a high speed with emphasis, comprehensive consideration, coordinated balance.
    As we stride into 1960, it is truly a spring garden with an excellent situation. As long as all cadres and the people of the province hold higher the red banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, hold higher the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, make persistent efforts, and advance victoriously; as long as we use the working method of both doing a good job in current production and preparing for the next step, seizing opportunities, and striving for initiative; as long as we constantly boost morale, strive for the upper reaches, and make the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy a climax, persistently and unremittingly develop it throughout the year; as long as we earnestly grasp the work of the first quarter and resolutely realize a full house red at the beginning, creating a good start for the red every quarter and the red throughout the year, we fully believe that we will definitely be able to realize the greater leap forward plan of the national economy in 1960, and will definitely be able to create better conditions for continuous Great Leap Forward in the coming years.

    迎接更大跃进的一九六○年
    中共江西省委第一书记  杨尚奎
    1959年过去了，新的1960年已经到来了。
    1959年是江西省国民经济在1958年大跃进的基础上，继续跃进的一年。全省人民和全国各地一样，以冲天的革命干劲，英勇忘我的劳动，更多更快更好更省地提前超额完成了国家计划。整个国民经济，无论工业、农业、交通运输、基本建设、财政贸易、科学文化卫生事业，各方面都呈现一片欣欣向荣的兴旺景象。人民群众的物质文化生活也得到相应的改善和提高。
    现在，展现在江西省人民面前的1960年，又是一个具有新的重大意义的一年。1960年要继续贯彻反右倾、鼓干劲，使国民经济在1959年继续跃进的基础上，力争实现更大的跃进。
    1960年的任务，是非常光荣的，也是更加繁重的。随着经济基数的迅速增大，国民经济的产值在这个基础上每增长1％，就代表着更大的绝对量。在飞跃前进的道路上，由于速度的加快，任务的加大，自然会出现一些新的问题、新的困难，譬如各项任务加大和劳动力之间的矛盾；基本建设与原料、材料供应之间的矛盾；交通运输上的运量和运力之间的矛盾；等等。只看到国民经济高涨中带来某些困难的一面，而看不到克服这些困难占主导地位的有利条件，是片面的，也是错误的，因为实现1960年更大跃进的客观可能性是完全具备的。首先随着党的八届八中全会和江西省委五届八次全会精神的深入贯彻执行，广大干部和群众的政治热情和生产积极性极大地高涨了。其次，人民公社更加巩固了，可以更加发挥它的旺盛的生命力和无比的优越性。复次，工业更大跃进的有利条件更多，经过第一个五年计划的建设和1958年和1959年的连续大跃进，工业已有巨大的发展，过去在江西省这张纸上几乎是空白的钢铁工业、化学工业、水泥工业……等等，现在已画上美丽的图画。过去设备简陋、机器陈旧的机械制造业、电机制造业等等，已得到了新的武装。再次，国民经济的交通运输、财政贸易、科学文教卫生等部门，经过几年来的发展，已有更大的力量来为工农业生产的更大跃进服务。
    要战胜前进中的困难，变客观可能性为现实性，实现1960年的更大跃进，必须坚决贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针。这条总路线充分发挥了人民群众的主观能动性，正确地反映了客观经济规律和人民群众的最大利益和迫切要求，1958年的大跃进和1959年的继续跃进，证明这条总路线是完全正确的。这条总路线是照耀各项工作前进的灯塔，实际工作中离开了这条总路线，就必然要犯“左”的或右的错误。要贯彻执行总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，最根本的是要贯彻执行“发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举”的方针。因为农业和工业是国民经济最基本的两条腿，是两个最基本的物质生产部门。这两大部门是互相结合、互为条件、互相促进的。这两大部门跃进了，整个国民经济的大跃进包括科学文化事业的大跃进，都有了可靠的保证。在贯彻执行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针时，必须使工业大力支援农业，首先保证农业的大跃进，因为农业是整个国民经济的基础和基本点。首先保证农业的大跃进，不但不会妨碍工业的发展，相反地会继续促进工业的不断大跃进。因为首先保证农业的大跃进，就能给工业提供越来越多的劳动力，提供越来越多的粮食和原料，提供越来越多的建设资金，提供越来越广阔的市场。所以农业的大跃进，就会积极地推动工业的大跃进。在贯彻执行发展工业同发展农业同时并举的方针上，我们强调首先保证农业的大跃进，还在于使整个国民经济协调的、按比例的、高速度的发展。有计划按比例的发展国民经济，是社会主义经济的发展规律。国民经济的各项比例关系中，最基本的是保持农业、轻工业、重工业之间的比例关系，这就是生产资料和消费资料两大部类的比例关系。它们之间的比例关系能够协调平衡的发展，国民经济就能高速度的跃进。鉴于农业的发展，受自然条件的限制较大，特别是当前我们还不能完全抵制特大的自然灾害的时候，更应该予以极大地注意，这是社会主义经济建设的规律所要求的。为首先保证农业的大跃进，工业必须大力支援农业，逐步消灭工农差别、城乡差别以及使工农联盟不仅在政治上，而且在新的经济基础上更加巩固的根本途径。工业要大力支援农业，就必须发展工业本身。
    要更好地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，实现1960年的更大跃进，必须进一步加强党的领导，充分发扬体现总路线精神的思想作风和工作方法。为此，首先，必须坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。我们党所领导的社会主义建设的群众运动，过去两年来大跃进的经验证明，是无坚不摧、无往不胜的。而要使这种群众运动形成高潮，并持久地发展下去，一定要持续地加强党的领导。必须看到，右倾思想、右倾情绪、右倾活动在当前虽然已经基本上克服了，但是还没有彻底清除；特别是在更大的跃进任务面前，有的看不到有利条件，过分强调困难、夸大缺点，表现畏难情绪和干劲不足；有的在贯彻土洋并举的方针上，对洋的、大的感兴趣，而对土的、小的不予注意，因此必须进一步开展两条建设路线的思想斗争，不断地批判跃进道路上出现的右倾保守思想，以保证总路线的贯彻执行。
    其次，必须大搞群众性的社会主义劳动竞赛。开展社会主义的劳动竞赛，是广泛地调动群众的生产积极性，充分发扬群众的首创精神和共产主义风格的最好形式。现在无论农村、厂矿、企业、学校、机关、部队，都风起云涌地开展着“立标兵、学标兵、赶标兵、超标兵”的竞赛运动。实践证明，这是一种较好的竞赛形式，因为旗帜鲜明，目标集中。全省各个战线都必须将这种竞赛形式更深入、更持久地发展下去。在领导这种竞赛中，全体干部既必须善于使先进的更加先进，使落后的赶上先进；又必须善于发现运动中涌现的新标兵。因为在你追我赶的夺上游、争先进的竞赛运动中，标兵并不是固定的、一成不变的。发现新的标兵，就应以满腔热情的态度，扶植它、支持它、积极帮助它成长壮大，只有不断地提高原有的标兵或树立新的标兵，才能不断地提高竞赛的水平，使竞赛持续地高涨下去。在广泛开展社会主义劳动竞赛中，还必须大力开展先进帮助后进，变先进生产者的生产水平为社会水平的运动。
    再次，必须大闹技术革新和技术革命。这也是大搞群众运动、大搞社会主义劳动竞赛的中心内容。技术革新和技术革命的重要性，随着生产的连续大跃进，已越来越使人们在实践中认识到，这是把革命热情和科学精神结合起来，把冲天干劲和巧劲结合起来，把劳逸有节奏地结合起来，发展数量，提高质量，降低成本，保证安全，多快好省的实现大跃进的关键所在。技术革新和技术革命的迫切性，随着生产的不断大跃进，也日益为人们所了解。因为农业要更大地跃进，工业要更大地跃进，国民经济的其他部门要更大地跃进，都需要大大地提高劳动生产率。要提高劳动生产率，如不积极进行技术革新和技术革命，单靠发挥群众的劳动积极性，改善劳动组织，甚至靠延长劳动时间，增加劳动强度，虽然还可挖出一定的潜力，但是有限的，而且是不能持久的，这与国民经济更大跃进的要求是远不适应的。大大提高劳动生产率的根本途径，是大闹技术革新和技术革命，这也是依靠现有人力无限地提高劳动生产率，实现不断大跃进的决定性的环节。大闹技术革新和技术革命，必须贯彻土、洋并举的“两条腿走路”的方针，无论工业、农业、交通运输业都应如此，绝不能单纯进行技术革命或依赖技术革命，而放松技术革新，恰恰相反，必须首先大闹技术革新，因为向现代化迈进，只能逐步实现，不能一蹴而就，同时由土到洋、由小到大是技术不断进步的规律。大闹技术革新和技术革命，必须放手发动群众，一切经过试验。对新的创造发明，经过鉴定，实际可行，立即推广，达到遍地开花。发动群众创造发明，既要围攻生产关键，又要加速整个生产过程的技术革新和技术革命。当前我省各个战线上，无论对生产关键或整个生产过程都有不少的重大的技术改革成就，如江西农业科学研究所试制成功的“江西五九型水田插秧机”；丰城紫云山水库全部土机械化施工；省建筑工程局总结和推行的基本建设施工安装土洋结合实行“五化”（水平运输车子化、垂直运输卷扬化、改良工具普遍化、构件预制工厂化、施工安装机械化）的经验等等，认真推广这些成功的技术成就，并继续放手发动群众大搞创造发明，就一定会大大地提高劳动生产率，就一定会为实现今年的更大跃进提供技术的保证。
    最后，必须进一步加强党的组织领导。加强党的领导是实现不断大跃进的根本保证。既抓政治，又抓经济；既抓住重点，又兼顾全面；既搞好生产，又搞好生活；既大搞群众运动，又搞好劳逸结合；制定计划既要积极，又要稳妥可靠，这是我们领导大跃进的根本经验，在实现1960年的更大跃进中，必须进一步发扬光大。各地区、各部门直至各个基层单位，要在贯彻一盘棋的方针下，及早制定自己的更大跃进计划，迅速提交群众广泛讨论，以便及早地动员群众、组织群众、调动群众的积极性。对于计划偏低和层层加码的现象都要注意防止，以便把1960年的大跃进计划得更好，组织得更好，安排得更好。一切工作都必须从积极促进工农业生产、特别是农业生产的更大跃进着眼，进行安排部署。一切部门也必须从促进工农业生产的大跃进来规划自己的发展，安排自己的工作。领导上不但要抓紧计划，而且要经常注意检查，作好积极的平衡工作，达到步步落实，以便使整个国民经济突出重点、兼顾全面、协调平衡的高速度发展。
    当我们昂首阔步跨进1960年的时候，真是春色满园，形势极好。只要全体干部和全省人民更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，再接再厉，乘胜前进；只要我们运用既作好当前生产，同时为下一步作好准备，争取时机、争取主动的工作方法，只要我们不断地鼓干劲、争上游，使增产节约的群众运动高潮，持之以恒，一浪高一浪地贯串全年地发展下去；只要我们切实抓紧第一季度的工作，坚决实现开门满堂红，为以后的季季红、全年红创造一个良好的开端，我们完全相信，一定能够实现1960年国民经济的更大跃进计划，一定能够为以后连年不断地大跃进创造更好的条件。　（摘自江西“跃进”1960年第一期）
