Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Electric Dispatch: The Changwei Special District's Xiashan Reservoir construction site in Shandong Province has done a good job in safety and hygiene and in the welfare of migrant workers. The migrant workers are healthy, the labor attendance rate is as high as about 98%, and the average work efficiency exceeds the quota by nearly one time.

From the beginning of the project, the Xiashan Reservoir Project Party Committee attached importance to safety and hygiene. At all levels of the construction site, leadership established safety and hygiene, and welfare organizations and dedicated institutions. There were also 233 fire brigades and 346 safety inspectors and supervisors on the construction site. Since the start of construction, the construction site has organized several major inspections and on-site meetings to carry out safety, hygiene, and life assault week campaigns. Mass inspections and evaluations are also regularly carried out throughout the construction site. For example, they held an on-site meeting in the Gouxi Camp of the Weifang construction section, which did a better job in safety, hygiene, and life, set up a banner, and promoted the experience of Gouxi Camp. In a short period of time, the entire construction site renovated "ten-thousand-person stoves", partitioned stoves, and recirculating smokeless stoves, which saved grain, coal, and manpower, and made the kitchen clean and hygienic. The Gaomi construction section built new pancake stoves and baked cake stoves, and implemented refined processing of coarse grains, making the variety of food reach more than 20 kinds.

The entire construction site’s safety and hygiene and welfare work have implemented the working method of following the mass line. Propaganda activities were carried out in depth throughout the construction site, and safety and hygiene covenants were formulated at all levels. Through the Red and Expert School, the construction site trained more than 3,000 health workers, cooks, manure managers, and safety inspectors. They are active in various construction sections and have become a backbone force that plays an important role in safety and hygiene. Eighty-five non-detached volunteer safety inspectors in the Anqiu construction section not only publicized to migrant workers but also conducted inspections, helping the leadership to discover and eliminate unsafe factors in a timely manner. Since the start of construction, no accidents have occurred in the entire construction section.

In winter, the lives of migrant workers on the construction site are well arranged. The work sheds are mostly built with earthen walls and thatched roofs, with grass curtains blocking the doors and windows to prevent wind and rain. The sleeping berths have thick bedding grass. Under the slogan of "One person must meet the needs of a hundred people, and skillful hands can make a hundred kinds of meals," the cooking staff made refined processing of coarse grains and didn't treat coarse vegetables coarsely, achieving diversification of meals. Migrant workers can eat enough, eat cooked food, and eat hot food. The environmental hygiene and personal hygiene of the construction site are also very good. The rows of work sheds along the construction site are like new villages on the construction site. The roads are clean and dust-free, the toilets are cleaned daily, and the manure is sealed with mud and fermented for harmless treatment. The kitchen utensils are placed in an orderly manner and washed as they are used. They also set up earthen pit spittoons, hanging cans, and bamboo tube running water washing devices. In the more than 50 days since the start of construction, there has not been a single case of infectious disease on the construction site. The migrant workers reflected: "Life on the construction site is really good, it is hard to describe with exquisite craftsmanship; the weather is cold, but the heart is warm, and the soldiers are strong and motivated."

This newspaper reported that the Zhengqiao Reservoir construction site branch of the Hengxi Commune in Xianju County, Zhejiang Province, cares for the lives of migrant workers in many ways to ensure construction safety.

The Zhengqiao Reservoir has more than 1,600 technicians and migrant workers. After the reservoir was fully started, the construction site party branch attached great importance to the workers' living management. In the past month, they have cared for the lives of migrant workers in the following aspects: First, it is stipulated that a canteen should be opened for more than 50 people, and the canteen should grow vegetables and raise pigs to ensure that migrant workers eat enough and eat well. Now 15 mu of vegetables have been planted and 15 pigs have been raised on the construction site, and preparations are being made to expand the vegetable field to 100 mu and raise 50 pigs to achieve pig raising in every canteen. Second, organize supply and marketing stores, cooperative restaurants, and peddlers to go to the construction site to ensure that migrant workers can buy things conveniently and eat conveniently; a hospital is opened on the construction site, and six health workers go to the construction site to treat migrant workers' injuries. When the weather is cold, the construction site hospital also uses local methods to make lip balm to protect the skin of migrant workers. Third, set a work schedule to ensure that migrant workers get eight hours of sleep and combine work with rest. Fourth, establish a safety system, stipulating that tool inspections should be carried out before work, sentries should be stationed in dangerous areas of the construction site, and fire prevention work should be done to ensure the safe construction of migrant workers. Fifth, carry out recreational activities to adjust the lives of migrant workers. The entire reservoir organizes three amateur theater troupes, stipulating that they perform a play every two weeks, and each brigade has a propagandist who uses local radio to commend good people and good deeds on the construction site. Currently, two small programs, "Midnight Rooster Crowing" and "Reservoir Vision," have been performed, which are well received by migrant workers.

The more the Party cares for the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses. After the construction site party branch cared for the lives of migrant workers in all aspects, the attendance rate increased, and a wave of tool reforms was launched, ensuring that the average work efficiency of each person was generally improved by two cubic meters compared with the original, greatly accelerating the construction of the reservoir.

This newspaper reported from Nanchang on the 11th that the Shimen Reservoir in Ruichang County, Jiangxi Province, implemented the working method of the mass line, convened a meeting of migrant worker representatives, implemented democratic management, and the migrant workers had a good life and high construction efficiency.

The Shimen Reservoir needs to complete 700,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and there are more than 4,800 migrant workers. In order to properly arrange the lives of migrant workers and give full play to their enthusiasm, the construction site party committee conducted a comprehensive inspection of the living conditions of migrant workers. During the inspection, it was found that the management system was not sound enough, and the care for the lives of migrant workers was not enough. The main reason was that the working method of the mass line was not seriously implemented. Therefore, the construction site party committee decided that migrant workers should elect representatives to participate in the management of the construction site. Before the first meeting of migrant worker representatives, the migrant worker representatives widely collected the opinions of the majority of migrant workers on the management of the construction site, and made timely improvements to the problems raised by the migrant workers regarding tool management, life, and other aspects. For example, on the issue of tool management, in response to the past situation where there was no dedicated person to manage, a unified allocation to the team was adopted, and a "three-package" management responsibility system of "contracting use, contracting management, and contracting repair" was implemented. In terms of life, in view of the large number of people on the construction site and the cold weather, the decentralized food units were changed to collective construction site canteens, and lids were added when sending food.

At the first meeting of representatives, the construction site party committee gave the representatives a comprehensive introduction to the construction of the reservoir and the existing problems, and detailed the five accounts of the engineering tasks, time requirements, benefited area, economic effects, and technological innovation. In this way, the representatives had a clear idea and put forward more than 170 technological innovation proposals, which accelerated the progress of the project and ensured the completion of the task ahead of schedule.

The convening of the meeting of migrant worker representatives was warmly welcomed by all migrant workers, fully mobilizing their enthusiasm. It is estimated that the entire earthwork task can be completed 20 days ahead of schedule. (Attached pictures)

    据新华社济南电　山东省昌潍专区峡山水库工地安全卫生和民工生活福利工作搞得好，民工身体健康，劳动出勤率高达98％左右，工效平均超过定额将近一倍。
    峡山水库工程党委从工程开始，就重视安全卫生工作。工地各级领导都成立了安全卫生、生活福利组织和专职机构。工地上还设有消防队二百三十三个，安全检查监督员三百四十六名。开工以来，工地专门组织了几次大检查和现场会，开展安全卫生生活突击周运动。群众性的检查评比，在全工地上也经常坚持进行。例如他们在安全卫生生活搞得较好的潍坊工段沟西营召开现场会议，树立旗帜，推广沟西营的经验。在短时间内，全工地就改建了“万人灶”、隔壁灶、回笼无烟灶等锅灶，既能节省粮、煤和人力，又能使伙房内干净卫生。高密工段新建煎饼炉、火烧炉，实行粗粮细作，使饭菜花样达到二十多种。
    整个工地安全卫生和生活福利工作都贯彻了走群众路线的工作方法。全工地深入地开展宣传活动，层层制订安全卫生公约。工地通过红专学校，训练出三千多名保健员、炊事员、粪便管理员、安全检查员，他们活跃在各个工段上，成了一支对安全卫生起着重要作用的骨干力量。安丘工段八十五名不脱产的义务安全检查员，既对民工宣传，又进行检查，帮助领导方面及时发现和消灭不安全因素，全工段自开工以来从未发生任何事故。
    冬季，工地民工的生活都安排得很好。工棚多是土打墙，草苫顶，门窗挡有草帘，防风防雨。睡铺有厚厚的铺草。炊事人员在“一人要称百人意，巧手能做百样饭”的口号下，粗粮细作，粗菜不粗吃，做到了饭菜多样化。民工都能吃饱、吃熟、吃热。工地环境卫生、个人卫生也很好。沿着工地的一排排工棚，就像工地新村一样。道路洁净无尘，厕所每日清扫，粪便泥封发酵，进行无害化处理。伙房用具放置得井然有序，随用随刷。他们还设置了土坑痰盂、吊罐、竹筒流水洗脸器等。从开工以来的五十多天内，工地上没有发生过一起传染病。民工们反映：“工地生活实在好，精工巧手也难描；天寒地冻心里暖，兵强马壮干劲高。”
    本报讯　浙江仙居县横溪公社郑桥水库工地党支部从多方面关心民工生活，保证施工安全。
    郑桥水库共有一千六百多个技工和民工，水库全面动工兴建以后，工地党支部就很重视工人的生活管理。近一个月来，他们从以下几方面关心民工生活：一，规定五十个人以上开办一个食堂，食堂种菜、养猪，保证民工吃饱、吃好。现在工地上已种了十五亩菜，养了十五头猪，准备把菜地扩种到一百亩，猪养到五十头，达到个个食堂养猪。二，组织供销店、合作饭店和货郎担上工地，保证民工买东西方便，饮食方便；工地开设医院，有六个保健员上工地巡回为民工治伤。天气冷了，工地医院还采用土法制润脂，保护民工皮肤。三，定作息时间，保证民工睡足八小时，做到劳逸结合。四，建立安全制度，规定上工时进行工具检查，工地危险区站哨，并且做好防火工作，保证民工安全施工。五，开展文娱活动，调剂民工生活。全水库组织三个业余剧团，规定二星期演一次戏，每个大队都有一个宣传员，在工地上用土广播表扬好人好事。目前已演出自编的“半夜鸡啼”和“水库远景”等二个小节目，民工反映很好。
    党越关心群众，群众的干劲越大。工地党支部从各方面关心民工们生活以后，出勤率提高了，并且掀起了改革工具热潮，保证每人的平均工效普遍比原来提高二方，大大加快了水库建设的速度。
    本报南昌11日电　江西瑞昌县石门水库贯彻群众路线的工作方法，召开民工代表大会，实行民主管理，民工生活好，施工工效高。
    石门水库需要完成七十万土石方任务，民工达四千八百多人。为了妥善地安排民工的生活，发挥民工的积极性，工地党委对民工生活情况，进行了全面检查。检查中，发现管理制度还不够健全，对民工的生活照顾不够，主要的原因是没有认真执行群众路线的工作方法。于是，工地党委决定由民工推举代表，参加工地管理。召开第一次民工代表大会之前，通过民工代表广泛收集了广大民工对工地管理的意见，对民工们提出的关于工具管理、生活等方面的问题，及时作了改进。如在工具管理问题上，针对过去无专人管理的情况，采取了统一分配到队的办法，实行“包用、包管、包修”的三包管理责任制。在生活上，根据工地人多、天气冷的情况，将分散的伙食单位改为集体工地食堂，送饭时都加上了盖子。
    在召开第一次代表大会时，工地党委把水库施工的情况和存在的问题向代表们作了全面的介绍，并详细地算了工程任务、时间要求、受益面积、经济效果和技术革新等五笔账。这样，代表们心里有了底，并且提出了一百七十多条技术革新建议，使工程进度加快，保证提前完成任务。
    民工代表大会的召开，受到了全体民工热烈的欢迎，充分调动了民工的积极性，预计全部土方任务可提前二十天完成。（附图片）
