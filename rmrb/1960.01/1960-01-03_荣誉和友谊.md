    Honor and Friendship
    Ming Lang, Head of the China Sichuan Opera Troupe
    The China Sichuan Opera Troupe, gathering the most outstanding Sichuan Opera actors and carrying the profound friendship of the Chinese people, along with more than ten brilliant plays, left the motherland at the end of July and visited four brotherly countries: Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and Bulgaria. Lasting 142 days, it successfully completed the task entrusted by the motherland. Now, it returns carrying the profound friendship of the people of the brotherly countries. During this period, we visited the capitals of the four countries and 36 other cities, performing 69 shows. In addition to the much larger number of audiences and listeners reached through film, television, and radio, we directly met with more than 77,000 audience members. We introduced the art of Sichuan Opera to the people of the brotherly countries and conducted cultural exchanges. Through visits, discussions, and other means, we also learned a lot from the working people and artists of the brotherly countries.
    Before going abroad, like many friends who care about Sichuan Opera, we were also worried about whether Sichuan Opera, as a local opera genre, could be accepted by audiences in brotherly countries. This concern played a certain role in spurring on our preparation work and daily activities, but the facts have now proven that it can be accepted. Not only was it accepted by the people of the brotherly countries, but it also won their praise and love. The Warsaw Life newspaper of Poland said that Sichuan Opera made the "residents of their city fascinated." The Czech New Freedom newspaper said: "Chinese Opera has caused a sensation in our city." When performing in cities such as Pleven and Kazanlak in Bulgaria, the venues were not only packed, but standing tickets were also sold, and the theaters were jam-packed. In the German Democratic Republic, we coincided with their 10th anniversary of the founding of the country, and we participated in the "Berlin Festival" performances held to celebrate this great festival. Dr. Pischner, Deputy Minister of Culture of Germany, said at a banquet: "The performance of Sichuan Opera is a pearl in our Berlin Festival." No matter which country we were in, during our performances, the audience often burst into laughter at the comedic plots in the plays, and sometimes shed tears of sympathy for the tragic experiences of the characters. When the performance ended, the audience always responded with thunderous applause, and sometimes couldn't help but dance and stomp their feet. The final curtain call was usually more than ten times, with the most reaching twenty-two times. In some places, after the curtain call ended, the audience was still reluctant to leave the theater.
    This time, the Sichuan Opera's overseas performances were first recognized by many newspapers and periodicals for their populism. They praised that "Sichuan Opera maintains close contact with the people" and "has profound realism and democracy." Some newspapers and periodicals regarded "high populism" as a characteristic of Sichuan Opera. The plays that Sichuan Opera brought abroad this time were almost all themed on praising the kindness, intelligence, wit, and bravery of Chinese women, and almost all denounced the evils of the old society, especially the oppression, trampling, and discrimination against women in feudal society. These plays not only bear the mark of the old China era but also have the brilliance of the new China era. As some commentators said: "Bringing joy and tears of sympathy to the audience." "The Sichuan Opera Troupe's performance expresses the Chinese people's generations of aspirations for a happy life. Expresses people's criticism of social ills." The fact that Sichuan Opera's populism was universally praised in brotherly countries powerfully illustrates that since liberation, local operas have correctly implemented the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" literary and artistic policy, and have achieved remarkable achievements in sorting out traditional repertoires.
    Secondly, there is the "superb performing arts" of Sichuan Opera. People seem to want to use all the beautiful words to praise the performance of Sichuan Opera as "poetic and picturesque," "humorous and witty," "charming lyricism," and "vivid details." Friends believe that "the performance of Sichuan Opera is very full of life and easy to understand," and that "without scenery, without translation, only relying on the actors' performance and simple props, being able to make the audience understand the plot and be moved is the greatest success of artistic performance." Some people even regard "good performance" as one of the characteristics of Sichuan Opera.
    Thirdly, this time we brought three large plays, two medium-sized plays, and seven small plays. The advantage of small plays is that they are short and concise, each with its own style, and one performance can allow most of the main actors to meet the audience. However, large plays can more comprehensively, systematically, and deeply unfold the plot, introduce Sichuan Opera art, express the talent of the actors, and be more thought-provoking. This time abroad, according to the audience, theater conditions, and performance frequency, we appropriately arranged the performance of large plays, medium-sized plays, and small plays, and the response was good. From the musical aspect, also due to the different sizes of the plays, Kun, Gao, Hu, and Dan all cooperated wonderfully, especially the chorus, which is one of the characteristics of Sichuan Opera, aroused the interest of many people.
    The Party and government leaders of our brotherly countries watched our performances and gave us great encouragement. Comrades from the cultural departments and colleagues in the arts of these countries gave us enthusiastic help and support. The friendship that the audience expressed to us was truly moving. People called us cultural envoys of new China, called us Chairman Mao's literary and artistic team, and wherever we went, enthusiasm and friendship surrounded us. We lived in the brotherly countries for more than four months, and it was as if we were living in an ocean of enthusiastic friendship. It is enough to give just a few examples: When we were about to leave Poland, we arrived in a city on the Polish-Czech border—Cieszyn. The masses on this side of the bridge, holding flowers and playing drums and music, formed a line of farewell, shaking hands, embracing, and even shedding tears to bid us farewell one by one. And the Czechoslovak comrades and masses on the other side were waving flowers and cheering, waiting for us to pass. At this time, in our hearts, we really couldn't tell whether it was joy or bitterness. Hana, who assisted us in announcing the performances in Czechoslovakia, became good friends with one of our actors named Yu Guobing. The two of them understood everything about each other without relying on the help of translation at all. In Germany, we stayed in a resort—Willingen. The gurgling water of the Elbe River and the rugged rocks of the Bastei Mountains certainly left us with a deep impression, but the friendship of the people there was even more unforgettable. Mayor Stuen personally accompanied us on tours and played his masterful piano for us. Old boatman Klaus and Li Xiaofei, who played the boatman in "Autumn River," became good friends in the same industry, and the hotel staff and Dai Xueru, who taught them how to make Chinese stew, became sisters of different surnames. The other members of the troupe could also find their own brothers, sisters, or friends in Willingen. We also had a get-together with the Palucca School of Dance in Dresden. The 57-year-old dancer Ms. Palucca and her students performed a brilliant ballet for us and also made a movie together. When we boarded the international train from Germany to Bulgaria via Dresden, teachers and friends from the dance school still rushed to see us off in the middle of the night. On December 3, we went to visit relatives at the "Oriental Red" agricultural production cooperative in Airin Pirin village, 30 kilometers away from Sofia. This cooperative had already established a "relative" relationship with the Sino-Bulgarian Friendship People's Commune in Beijing, so they called Chinese comrades "relatives" when they saw them. On this day, when the members heard that relatives were coming to have a get-together and perform, those who lived far away ran over early in the morning. After we performed a few programs, they gave us national costumes that they had sewn by hand. They treated us with the chickens they raised and the vegetables they grew themselves. We were also attracted by the rural scenery of chickens and ducks in groups, cattle and sheep in teams, haystacks piled in front of the doors, and peppers hanging from the windows, and we lingered, reluctant to leave.
    We visited factories and rural areas in the brotherly countries and saw that they were all moving forward with huge strides in building socialism. Their high labor enthusiasm inspired us, making us more firmly believe that the socialist camp is thriving and full of prosperity. The superb performances of their artists are also a model for us to learn from. Whether it is the opera in Berlin and Prague, the folk songs and dances in Sofia and Bratislava, or the operetta in Poznan, they have all played an enlightening and promoting role in our work, giving us rich nourishment.
    The fact that the Sichuan Opera Troupe's visit and performance in the Eastern European brotherly countries was able to achieve such success and honor is not only because the Sichuan Opera art itself has a rich tradition, and it has been cared for by leaders and helped by experts, and the Beijing Opera and other brotherly opera genres have left a good impression on the audiences in the brotherly countries in previous overseas performances; more importantly, it is inseparable from the deep friendship between the people of these brotherly countries and the people of our country.

    荣誉和友谊
    中国川剧团团长　明朗
    中国川剧团集中了川剧最优秀的演员，带着中国人民的深情厚意和十多个精采剧目，从7月底离开祖国，访问了波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、保加利亚四个兄弟国家，历时一百四十二天，胜利地完成了祖国交付的任务。现在，又带着兄弟国家人民的深情厚意回来。在这一段时间里，我们访问了四个国家的首都和其他共三十六个城市，演出了六十九场，除电影、电视、广播数字更大得多的观众、听众外，直接和七万七千多观众见了面。向兄弟国家人民介绍了川剧艺术，进行了文化交流。通过参观、访问、座谈等方式，也向兄弟国家的劳动人民和艺术家们学习了不少东西。
    在出国之前，和许多关心川剧的朋友们一样，我们也耽心着作为地方剧种的川剧，是否能为兄弟国家观众所接受。这种耽心在准备工作和日常工作中起了一定的鞭策作用，但现在的事实证明，它是可以被接受的。不但为兄弟国家人民所接受，而且博得了他们的赞扬和喜爱。波兰华沙生活报说川剧使他们“城市的居民看了入迷”。捷新自由报说：“中国歌剧轰动了我们的城市”。在保加利亚的普列文、加赞勒克等城市演出时，不仅座无虚席，而且卖了站票，剧场里挤得水泄不通。在德意志民主共和国恰逢他们建国十周年，我们参加了为庆祝这一伟大节日而举办的“柏林节”的演出。德文化部副部长皮什纳博士在一次宴会上说：“川剧的演出，是我们柏林节中的一颗珍珠。”不论在哪个国家，在我们演出的时候，观众经常为戏中的喜剧情节发出哄堂的笑声，有时也为剧中人物的悲惨遭遇洒下同情的眼泪。当演出结束时，观众总是报以暴风雨般的掌声，有时还不禁手之舞之，足之蹈之。剧终谢幕通常在十次以上，最多的达二十二次。有些地方在谢幕完毕以后，观众还恋恋不肯离开剧场。
    这次，川剧的出国演出，在许多报刊首先被公认的是川剧的人民性。他们称赞“川剧与人民保持着密切的联系”，“具有深刻的现实性与民主性”。有些报刊把“高度的人民性”当作川剧的特点加以评论。这次川剧出国所带的戏，几乎都是以歌颂中国妇女的善良、聪明、机智、勇敢为主题的剧目，几乎都是鞭挞旧社会的邪恶，特别是鞭挞封建社会压迫、作践和歧视妇女的剧目。这些剧目既具有旧中国时代的烙印，也具有新中国时代的光辉。正如有些评论所说：“给观众带来欢乐与同情的眼泪”。“川剧团的演出表现了中国人民世世代代争取幸福生活的愿望。表达了人们对社会不良现象的批评”。川剧的人民性在兄弟国家得到普遍赞扬这一事实，有力地说明解放以来地方戏曲正确贯彻党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”文艺方针，在整理传统剧目方面，获得了显著的成就。
    其次要算川剧“高超的表演艺术”了。人们似乎想用尽一切美好的词句，来赞扬川剧的表演“诗情画意”，“幽默风趣”，“迷人的抒情”，“淋漓的细节”。朋友们认为“川剧的表演很富于生活味，通俗易懂”，认为“不用布景，不用翻译，只凭演员的表演和简单的道具，能使观众理解剧情并且受到感动是艺术表演的最大成功”。有些人甚至把“表演好”作为川剧的特点之一。
    第三是这次出国带了三个大戏和两个中型戏、七个小戏。小戏的优点是短小精干，各具风格，一次演出能使主要演员大部和观众见面。大戏却能更全面，更系统，更深刻的展开剧情，介绍川剧艺术，表现演员的才华，更加耐人寻味。这次在国外，根据观众对象，剧场条件，演出场次，我们适当安排了大戏，中型戏和小戏的上演，反应良好。从音乐方面来说，也由于大中小戏的不同，昆，高，胡，弹各尽配合之妙，特别是川剧特点之一的帮腔，引起了不少人的兴趣。
    我们的兄弟国家的党政领导人都观看了我们的演出，给了我们很大的鼓励。这些国家文化部门的同志和艺术界的同行们，满腔热忱地给予我们以帮助和支持。观众们对我们表示的友情，实在令人感动。人们把我们称做新中国的文化使者，称做毛主席的文艺队伍，随便走到那里，热情和友谊就包围到那里。我们在兄弟国家生活了四个多月，简直像是生活在热情友谊的海洋里一样。只举出这么几个例子就够了：当我们要离开波兰的时候，走到波捷交界处的一个城市——切辛，桥这边的群众手执鲜花，奏着鼓乐，排成欢送的行列，一个一个的和我们握手、拥抱、甚至洒泪告别。而那边的捷克斯洛伐克同志和群众又在摇着鲜花，欢呼着等我们过去。这时我们心里，真是说不出到底是欢欣还是酸辛。在捷克斯洛伐克协助我们报幕的哈娜，和我们一个名叫余果冰的演员成了要好的朋友。她们两个一点也不依靠翻译的帮助，就互相了解了对方的一切。在德国我们住过休养胜地——威林，易北河的淙淙流水，巴士泰山的嶙峋怪石，固然给我们留下了深刻的印象，而那里人民的友情，更使人难以忘怀。市长司徒恩亲自陪我们参观游览，还为我们演奏他拿手的钢琴。老船夫格劳斯和在“秋江”里演艄翁的李笑非成了同行好友，旅馆的服务员和曾教她们做中国连锅汤的戴雪如成了异姓姐妹。剧团其他的人也都可以在威林找到自己的弟兄、姐妹或朋友。我们还和德累斯顿的巴鲁卡舞蹈学校联欢过，五十七岁的老舞蹈家巴鲁卡女士和她的学生为我们表演精采的芭蕾舞，还在一起拍了电影。在我们坐上国际列车离德赴保路经德累斯顿时，舞蹈学校的师友们在半夜里还赶来送别。12月3日，我们到离索非亚三十公里的艾林·匹林村“东方红”农业生产合作社走“亲戚”。这个合作社和我们北京市的中保友谊人民公社很早就已建立了“亲戚”关系，所以他们见到中国同志就喊“亲戚”。这一天，社员听说亲戚们要来联欢和演出，住得远的一大早就跑来了。我们表演了几个节目以后，他们把亲手缝制的民族服装送我们。用自己喂的鸡、自己种的菜招待我们。我们也被那里鸡鸭成群、牛羊结队、门前堆草垛、窗口挂辣椒的农村风光和主人们的盛情所吸引，流连忘返。
    我们参观了兄弟国家的工厂和农村，看到处处都在迈着建设社会主义的巨大步伐前进着。他们的高度的劳动热情鼓舞我们，使我们更坚信社会主义阵营欣欣向荣，一片兴旺景象。他们的艺术家们的精湛的表演也是我们学习的榜样，无论是柏林、布拉格的歌剧，索非亚、布拉底斯拉伐的民间歌舞，或是波兹南的轻歌剧，都对我们的工作起了启发、推动的作用，给了我们以丰富的营养。
    川剧团这次在东欧兄弟国家的访问演出能够得到这样的成功和荣誉，不仅是因为川剧艺术本身有优厚的传统，又得到首长关怀和专家的帮助，加以京剧和其他兄弟剧种历次出国在兄弟国家观众中留下了良好印象；更重要的是和这些兄弟国家的人民对我国人民之间的深厚友情分不开的。
