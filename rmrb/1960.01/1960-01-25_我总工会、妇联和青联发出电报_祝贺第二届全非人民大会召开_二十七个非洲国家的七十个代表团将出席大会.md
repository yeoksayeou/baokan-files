Under the new situation of African people's continuous victories, the convening of the Second All-African People's Conference is obviously of great significance. It will undoubtedly greatly strengthen the unity of the African people and powerfully promote the development of the African national independence movement."

The telegram said, "We are pleased to see that an increasing number of women in many African countries have participated in the national independence movement. We believe that women in various African countries will achieve greater success in the cause of national liberation and women's liberation."

The dawn has already shone on the African continent, and the African people and youth have awakened. Whether imperialism uses military suppression or political deception, it cannot save the fate of the final demise of the colonial system. As long as the African people and youth strengthen unity and persist in the struggle, final victory will surely belong to the African people and youth."

Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, January 23rd: According to the spokesman of the All-African People's Conference, seventy delegations from twenty-seven African countries will participate in the Second All-African People's Conference, which opens here on the 25th.

Delegates who have already arrived include those from Ethiopia, Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Cameroon, Zanzibar, Morocco, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.

Abdullah Diallo, Secretary-General of the Permanent Secretariat of the All-African People's Conference, told reporters, "Since the first conference, the cause of Africans has made great progress. National consciousness has increased, and the people of various countries fighting for independence have achieved encouraging results. But this gratifying development should not make us forget that colonialism is still trying to occupy Africa. The methods they adopt are to wage wars, engage in division and instigation, or implement policies of rule in new forms in order to hinder the unity of the African people."

Francis Wilcox, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, also arrived here on the 21st. It is said that many Americans from various U.S. organizations will attend the conference as "observers." It is pointed out here that Western countries feel "great interest" in this conference.

    新华社24日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天打电报热烈祝贺第二届全非人民大会的召开。
    电报说，“目前，非洲反对殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立的运动，震撼了整个非洲大陆。在非洲人民不断取得胜利的新形势下，第二届全非人民大会的召开，显然具有重要的意义，它无疑地将大大加强非洲人民的团结力量，和有力地推动非洲民族独立运动的发展。”

    新华社24日讯　中华全国青年联合会代表一亿三千万中国青年在23日打电报祝贺第二届全非人民大会的召开，并表示支持非洲人民的正义斗争。
    电报说，自从在阿克拉召开第一届全非人民大会一年多以来，“非洲人民争取民族独立、反对帝国主义的斗争又有了全面的发展和新的高涨。中国青年衷心欢呼非洲人民的伟大胜利，全力支持非洲人民和青年的正义斗争”。

    新华社突尼斯23日电　据全非人民大会发言人宣布，有二十七个非洲国家的七十个代表团将参加25日在这里开幕的第二次全非人民大会。
    已经到达这里的有埃塞俄比亚、尼日利亚、加纳、多哥、喀麦隆、桑给巴尔、摩洛哥、塞拉勒窝内和利比里亚等的代表。
