    Pig Raising Must Also Undergo Major Technological Innovation
    Amidst the excellent situation of the ever-increasing pig-raising upsurge, a large number of advanced units that develop pig-raising undertakings in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical have emerged throughout the country. For example, the Wulidian Animal Husbandry Farm of the Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune in Jiangbei District, Chongqing City, Sichuan Province, had only eight pigs in 1956, but it developed to 6,063 heads in 1959. In just three years, the number of pigs increased by more than 700 times. Currently, the 4,000 fat pigs in this pig farm are cared for, managed, and provided medical treatment by only more than 50 people, with an average of more than 80 pigs per person. Moreover, the pigs are raised very well. The largest fat pig weighs more than 800 jin, and the average weight is also 200-300 jin. The Yuan Yongming Youth Team of this farm, with five people, raises 1,050 pigs, averaging 210 pigs per person, and the pigs are growing just as well. In 1959, Shou Zhang County in Shandong Province raised more than 670,000 pigs, with the number of pigs increasing fivefold compared to the previous year. In 1959, the number of pigs in Qunli People's Commune in Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, also increased fourfold compared to the previous year. However, these two advanced pig-raising units did not increase the number of breeding and management personnel. Why can the pigs in advanced pig-raising units such as Wulidian Animal Husbandry Farm grow so fast? Why can a feeder raise dozens or even more than 200 pigs? Why has the number of pigs increased greatly in many advanced pig-raising units, while the number of feeders has not increased or even decreased significantly? It turns out that they have firmly grasped the two main links in pig raising: implementing advanced scientific breeding management and vigorously carrying out tool reforms.
    Technological innovation is a fundamental measure to improve labor productivity and accelerate the development of pig-raising undertakings. Some people may ask, industrial and agricultural production is complex, and technological innovation can be carried out on a large scale. Is it also necessary to carry out technological innovation in simple production labor such as pig raising? Yes, it is very necessary. After the advocacy of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the broad masses of farmers have a clearer and deeper understanding of the principle of "more pigs, more fertilizer; more fertilizer, more grain; more grain, more pigs." Many provinces, regions, counties, and people's communes have formulated plans for high-speed development of pig-raising undertakings, and the vast numbers of cadres and members are also determined, with soaring enthusiasm, to achieve great development in pig-raising undertakings in their respective regions and communes. This requires reforming the old methods of mating, breeding, feeding, fattening, disease prevention, etc.; efforts should be made to achieve full mating, full accuracy, full production (no stillbirths, no miscarriages), full survival, full strength, and full fattening, that is, to do mating, breeding, feeding, fattening, disease prevention, and other work quickly and well. It is also necessary to strive to implement advanced breeding management methods. For example, many advanced pig-raising units have promoted advanced methods of selecting and breeding, adopting appropriate age breeding, appropriate age mating, avoiding inbreeding, and using advanced mating methods such as early mating, double mating, and artificial insemination. Many pig farms have achieved self-breeding and self-raising, which not only overcomes the phenomenon that purchasing piglets from other places can easily bring infectious diseases but also improves the pig breed and basically solves the problem of pig sources. Many advanced pig-raising units have also implemented advanced methods of separate pen management and group feeding; implemented methods of fixed time, fixed quantity, coarse first and fine later, warm in winter and cool in summer, and feeding fully and evenly; in addition, they have done a good job in environmental sanitation in pig pens and prevented the occurrence of diseases. In this way, they basically achieve full survival, full strength, and full fattening. Therefore, pig raising is not as simple as some people imagine, and it does not require technological innovation. To truly achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results in pig raising, technological innovation must be realized. Large-scale collective breeding is not only possible but also more urgently requires the implementation of advanced scientific breeding management methods. This is because the original methods suitable for family private breeding are not suitable for today's large-scale collective breeding needs. Many problems that were not important before, such as isolation and disease prevention, have now become important problems in pig farms; especially, we must have high-speed development methods to develop pig-raising undertakings at high speed. If all pig farms across the country can implement advanced mating, breeding, and management methods, and increase the reproduction rate of pig farms across the country by 10%, or minimize the incidence and mortality rate, the hundreds of thousands or even millions of pig farms across the country will increase enormous wealth. More births, faster growth, and a significantly reduced mortality rate can enable our pig-raising undertakings to develop at high speed.
    From the current situation, in technological innovation, special attention should be paid to tool reform. At present, the pig-raising industry in a few people's communes has begun to develop at high speed, and the problem of insufficient labor in breeding management has also emerged. This will be a national problem. At present, feeders generally raise 30 pigs per person, and some even less than this number. If the country develops to two people per pig, that is, raising 300 million pigs, of which 100 million are privately raised, and there are 200 million publicly raised pigs, if calculated at 30 pigs per feeder, it would require about 7 million feeders. If one pig per person is to be achieved, with collective breeding of as many as more than 500 million pigs, it would require about 20 million feeders, which would almost account for about 20% of the country's rural able-bodied labor force. If one pig per mu is to be achieved, it would account for about 50% of the rural labor force. How can we possibly take out so much labor? Therefore, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of feeding. Now, some advanced pig farms have already achieved one person breeding and managing 100, 200, or even more pigs. The methods used by these advanced units to solve this problem are nothing more than two: one is to improve labor organization, strengthen labor management, implement the responsibility system, and implement the "three guarantees and one reward" system of guaranteeing output, guaranteeing labor, guaranteeing cost, and rewarding overproduction. The other is to vigorously engage in tool reform. The main reason why the Yuan Yongming Youth Team of the Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune in Chongqing can raise more than 200 pigs per person is that they have carried out tool reforms on the work that consumes the most labor in pig raising, such as feed processing, feed and manure transportation, and water use. The Tianjin Municipal Workers and Peasants Alliance Livestock Farm has initially reformed feeding tools and methods, with each person raising 300 pigs; further reforms are now being carried out, and their goal is to manage 700 pigs per person. From this point of view, as long as we earnestly mobilize the masses to use their brains, find shortcuts, and vigorously engage in tool reform, the efficiency of pig raising can be improved, and it is entirely possible to gradually achieve an average of 100, 200, or even more pigs per person.
    Do we have the conditions to carry out large-scale technological innovation in the pig-raising industry? Not only do we have the conditions, but the conditions are also very good. Collective pig raising is the first and most favorable condition. The large-scale development of collective pig raising in people's communes has led to the emergence of collective pig farms with hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of heads. This makes it easy to promote advanced breeding experience and reform breeding tools. For example, implement group feeding, timed feeding, cultivate excellent varieties, and promote advanced mating methods, etc. Due to collective breeding, and also due to the strong human and material resources of the people's communes, the pig-raising industry can be more closely integrated with other production undertakings of the commune, thereby cooperating with each other and carrying out large-scale technological innovation. For example, combined with the industry run by the commune, tool reform and tool manufacturing in the pig-raising industry are easier. Some commune livestock farms have taken advantage of this favorable condition and set up semi-mechanized equipment such as earth rails, earth tap water, electric grinders, feed slicers, and feed mixers in the farm, realizing semi-mechanization in the breeding process, and setting up feed bases, artificial insemination stations, veterinary hospitals, veterinary drug factories, and feed processing plants around the pig farm, thereby greatly improving breeding levels and labor efficiency.
    The rural tool reform movement in recent years has created many tools, many of which can be directly used in feeding tools. The most labor-intensive aspects of pig raising are feed crushing, processing, feed and manure transportation, and water supply, all of which have readily available tools that can be used. Feed crushing and processing can use agricultural product processing tools and cooking tools, such as grass cutters, slicers, and vegetable cutters. There are even more tools for transporting feed and manure, with various types of carts, rails, and earth trains; water can be transported with water lifting tools and earth tap water, etc. Of course, the use of these tools must be combined with the specific conditions of the communes in various places, and necessary modifications should be made according to the needs and possibilities of collective pig raising. At the same time, many places have already made many reforms to feeding tools, and problems can be solved as long as they are well organized and promoted. For example, Hunan Province recently held an on-site meeting on the reform of feeding tools in Guangxingzhou People's Commune, Yueyang County, and vigorously promoted the commune's experience in semi-mechanization of cutting materials, self-flowing water use, and vehicle transportation of feed. As a result, many people's communes across the province quickly realized the comprehensive reform of feeding tools.
    Experience in various places proves that as long as we fully mobilize and rely on feeders and managers, combined with workers from factories run by the commune, and carry out large-scale technological innovation based on local conditions, it is entirely possible to successfully realize the task of technological innovation in the pig-raising industry. At present, there are already millions of feeders across the country. They love the pig-raising business, they have rich experience, and they know best which tasks need to be innovated most and which tools need to be reformed most. As long as we mobilize the vast number of feeders and everyone uses their brains to find solutions, the technological innovation movement in the pig-raising industry will develop rapidly.
    At present, the situation in the pig-raising industry across the country is extremely good. People's communes in various places have generally taken action, forming a mass pig-raising upsurge. The Party's leadership should be strengthened, politics should be put in command, the weak links in pig-raising work should be grasped, and timely solutions should be made. It is necessary to carry out extensive technological innovation in the pig-raising industry and greatly improve the level of pig-raising work, laying a solid foundation for the high-speed development of pig-raising production.

    养猪也要大搞技术革新
    在养猪高潮日日高的大好形势下，全国各地都出现了大量多、快、好、省地发展养猪事业的先进单位，比如四川重庆市江北区中苏友好人民公社的五里店畜牧场，1956年还只有八头猪，1959年就发展到六千零六十三头，短短的三年时间，猪的头数增加了七百多倍。现在，这个养猪场的四千头肥猪，只有五十多人负责饲养、管理和医疗工作，平均每人负责八十多头猪，而且把猪饲养得十分好，最大的肥猪有八百多斤，一般的也有二、三百斤。该场的袁永明青年队五个人养一千零五十头猪，平均一人养二百一十头，猪长得同样出色。山东省寿张县1959年养猪六十七万多头，猪的头数比上一年增加了五倍；江西省玉山县群力人民公社猪的头数1959年也比上年增加四倍，但这两个养猪先进单位，都没有增加饲养管理人员。为什么五里店畜牧场等养猪先进单位的猪能增长得这么快？为什么他们一个饲养员能喂养几十头甚至二百多头猪？为什么许多先进养猪单位猪的头数大量增加，饲养员没有增加甚至还大大减少？原来，他们紧紧抓住了养猪工作中的两个主要环节：实行先进的科学的饲养管理和大搞工具改革。
    技术革新是提高劳动生产率，加快发展养猪事业的一个根本的措施。有人会问，工农业生产复杂，可以大搞技术革新，像养猪这种简单的生产劳动，也需要搞技术革新吗？需要，非常需要。经过党中央和毛主席的提倡，广大农民群众对于“猪多肥多，肥多粮多，粮多猪多”的道理是认识得更清楚更深刻了。很多省、区、县和人民公社都制定出了高速度发展养猪事业的规划，广大干部和社员也正以冲天干劲，决心使本地区本公社的养猪事业实现一个大发展。这就必须对旧的配种、繁殖、喂养、育肥、防疫等方法，加以改革；要努力做到全配、全准、全产（不死胎、不流产）、全活、全壮和全肥，就是要把配种、繁殖、喂养、育肥、防疫等等工作都做得又快又好。还要努力实行先进的饲养管理方法。比如许多养猪先进单位推行了先进的选种育种方法，采取适龄繁殖，适龄配种，不让近亲杂交，以及提早配、双重配、人工授精等先进的配种方法，不少猪场作到自繁自养，不仅克服了从外地购买小猪容易带来传染病的现象，还改良了猪种，并且基本解决了猪源问题。许多养猪先进单位还实行了先进的分圈管理，分群喂养的方法；实行了定时、定量，先粗后细，冬温夏凉，喂饱喂匀的方法；此外，又作好猪圈的环境卫生，预防疾病的发生。这样就基本上做到全活、全壮和全肥。所以养猪这件事并不像某些人想像的那样简单，不需要技术革新。要在养猪方面，真正做到多快好省，必须实现技术革新。大规模的集体饲养不仅可能而且更迫切需要实行先进的科学的饲养管理方法，这是因为原来的适合家庭私人喂养的方法不适合今天大规模集体饲养的需要了；原来有许多并不重要的问题，如隔离防疫，现在在养猪场里却变成了重要的问题；特别是我们要高速度发展养猪事业，就得有高速度发展的办法。如果全国各个养猪场都能实行先进的配种、饲养、管理方法，使全国各养猪场的繁殖率提高10％，或把发病率和死亡率降到最小限度，全国几十万以至上百万的养猪场，将会增加多么巨大的财富。生得多、长得快、死亡率大大降低，才能使我们的养猪事业高速度发展起来。
    从目前情况来看，技术革新中，应特别注意工具改革，现在已有少数人民公社的养猪业开始高速度地发展，饲养管理方面的劳力不足的问题也随之出现。这将是一个全国性的问题。现在各地饲养员一般每人养三十头猪，有的还不到此数。如果全国发展到两人一头猪，就是养三亿头猪。其中一亿头作为私养，还有两亿头公养的猪，如果按一个饲养员养三十头猪计算，就需要七百万左右的饲养员。如果要达到一人一头猪，集体饲养的猪多至五亿多头，就需二千万左右饲养员，这就几乎占全国农村精壮劳力的20％左右，如果要达到一亩地一头猪，则更要占农村劳力的50％左右。我们怎么可能拿出这样多的劳力呢？因此，非提高饲养工效不可。现在，有一些先进养猪场已经作到一个人饲养管理一百头、二百头甚至更多的猪。这些先进单位解决这个问题的方法不外两条：一是改善劳动组织，加强劳动管理，贯彻责任制度，实行包产量、包人工、包成本和超产奖励的“三包一奖”制。一是大闹工具改革。重庆中苏友好人民公社袁永明青年队所以能够一人养二百多头猪，最主要的原因就是由于他们把养猪花费劳动最多的工作，如饲料加工，饲料、粪肥的运输，用水等都进行了工具改革。天津市工农联盟畜牧场初步改革了饲养工具和饲养方法，每人养猪三百头；现在正在作进一步改革，他们的努力目标是一人管理七百头。这样看来，只要认真发动群众动脑筋、找窍门，大闹工具改革，养猪工效是可以提高的，一个人平均饲养一百头、二百头以至更多的猪是完全可以逐步作到的。
    我们有没有条件在养猪业中大搞技术革新呢？不仅有条件，而且条件还好得很。集体养猪就是第一个最有利的条件。人民公社的集体养猪业的大发展，几百头、几千头甚至上万头的集体养猪场出现了。这就容易推广先进的饲养经验，容易改革饲养工具。例如实行分群喂养、定时喂养、培育优良品种和推行先进的配种方法，等等。由于集体饲养，也由于人民公社人力物力雄厚，就可以使养猪业与公社的其他生产事业更密切地结合起来，从而互相配合、大搞技术革新，比如同社办工业结合，养猪业的工具改革和工具制造就更加容易了。有的公社畜牧场由于发挥了这种有利条件，在场内设置了土铁轨、土自来水、电动磨、饲料切片机、饲料搅拌机等半机械化设备，在饲养过程中实现了半机械化，在养猪场周围设立了饲料基地、人工授精站、兽医院、兽药厂、饲料加工厂等，因而大大提高了饲养水平和劳动效率。
    几年来的农村的工具改革运动，已经创造了好多工具，其中许多是可以直接用到饲养工具方面来的。养猪最费劳力的是饲料的粉碎、加工和饲料、猪粪的运输以及用水的供应这几方面，这些都有现成的工具可以搬用。饲料的粉碎与加工可以利用农产品加工工具和炊事工具，譬如铡草机、切片机、切菜机等等。运输饲料、猪粪的工具更多，有各种各样的车子、轨道、土火车；运水则有提水工具和土自来水等等。当然，这些工具的搬用还须结合各地公社的具体条件，根据集体养猪的需要和可能，加以必要的改装。同时，许多地方饲养工具已有不少改革，只要很好地组织推广就能解决问题。例如湖南省最近在岳阳县广兴洲人民公社召开了饲养工具改革的现场会议，大力推广这个公社的切料半机械化、用水自流化和运饲料车子化的经验。结果，全省很多的人民公社很快实现了饲养工具的全面改革。
    各地经验证明，只要我们充分发动和依靠饲养员和管理人员，结合社办工厂的工人，根据当地的条件，大搞技术革新，是完全能够很好地实现养猪业中的技术革新任务的。现在，全国饲养员已经数以百万计，他们热爱养猪事业，他们有丰富的经验，他们最知道哪些工作最需要革新，哪些工具最需要改革。只要我们把广大饲养员动员起来，人人动脑筋，想办法，养猪业中的技术革新运动是会迅速地开展起来的。
    现在，全国养猪业的形势极好，各地人民公社已经普遍行动起来，形成了群众性的养猪热潮。应当加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，抓住养猪工作中的薄弱环节，及时加以解决。要在养猪业中广泛进行技术革新，将养猪工作的水平大大提高一步，为高速度地发展养猪生产奠定有力的基础。
