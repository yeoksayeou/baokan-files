    Rely on the Masses to Build Simple Machinery; Utilize Natural Power According to Local Conditions
    Xining Railway Bureau Achieves Semi-Mechanized Construction
    (Our Dispatch) Workers and staff of the Ministry of Railways' Xining Railway Bureau, in the movement for technological innovation and revolution, have vigorously grasped the reform of construction machinery and have achieved remarkable results. At present, the bureau's various construction sites have basically achieved mechanized and semi-mechanized construction. The proportion of mechanical and small-scale mechanical construction adopted at each construction site averages more than 90%.
    Most of these semi-mechanized tools were created by the workers using indigenous methods, and have the advantages of high efficiency, material saving, simple manufacturing, and easy operation. For example, the "steel reinforcement rail tipper truck" created by the workers uses coarse steel reinforcement instead of small steel rails, and small pulleys instead of large wheels, which saves steel and improves efficiency. This type of truck can transport an average of 25 cubic meters of earth per worker per day within a distance of 100 meters. Based on the principle of adapting to local conditions, the workers also tried every means to utilize natural power such as wind and water. They used windmills to drive transport machinery in the windy conditions of the Qinghai Plateau; following the characteristic of railway construction along rivers, they installed many water-powered machines. For example, water-powered winches, water-powered saws, and so on. In particular, last summer, small and simple hydropower stations began to be built at various riverside construction sites, which found a shortcut to solving the problem of machinery power. Now, the bureau has built 20 small hydropower stations, using electricity to drive various vehicles, elevate transport tools, drag rolling tools, and provide lighting for the construction site. The workers praised their construction site: The General Line shines brightly, the technological revolution is in full swing. We sit on the vehicle during the day, and the electric lights are bright at night, building the railway easily and happily, all thanks to the Party's good policies.
    The workers have also created many large-scale power machines. Last year, they made more than 100 various power machines and 77 various lathes. These power machines include: the "frozen soil sawing machine" that solves the key problem of digging frozen soil in winter construction, the "excavating and loading machine" that solves the key problem of earthwork excavation and loading, and the "electric ramming machine," etc.
    Now, many construction sites no longer see people carrying loads by hand. It is truly a scene of roaring machines, groups of small vehicles, and a network of tracks. With the realization of mechanized and semi-mechanized construction, the bureau's labor productivity has greatly improved. The efficiency of earth excavation has increased from 2.74 cubic meters per person per day to 6.95 cubic meters, and the efficiency of rock excavation has increased from 2 cubic meters per person per day to 4.22 cubic meters. In the third quarter of last year, labor productivity in tunnel and bridge construction increased by 20% to 41% compared with the same period in 1958. The bureau completed the 1959 construction plan 56 days ahead of schedule. (Attached picture)

### 依靠群众大造简易机械  因地制宜利用天然动力  西宁铁路局实现半机械化施工

    依靠群众大造简易机械  因地制宜利用天然动力
    西宁铁路局实现半机械化施工
    本报讯  铁道部西宁铁路局职工在技术革新和技术革命运动中，狠抓施工机具的改革，已经取得显著成绩。目前，全局各施工工点已经基本实现了机械化半机械化施工。各施工点采用机械和小型机械施工的比重，平均达到90％以上。
    这些半机械化的工具，大部分是职工们用土办法创制的，具有效率高、用料省、制造简便、操作容易等优点。例如工人创造的“钢筋轨道翻板车”，用粗钢筋代替小型钢轨，用小滑轮代替大车轮，既节省了钢材，又提高了效率。这种车子，在一百米的运距内，一天平均每工能运土二十五立方米。根据因地制宜的原则，职工们还千方百计利用风力、水力等自然动力。他们利用青海高原多风的条件，用风车来推动运输机具；按照铁路建设多沿江河的特点，安装了很多以水为动力的机具。例如水力绞车、水力锯等等。特别是在去年夏天，各沿河工地上，开始建立小型简易水电站，这就给解决机具动力问题找到了一条捷径。现在，全局已经建起了二十座小型水电站，用电来带动各种车辆、升高运输工具、拖拉碾压工具、供给工地照明。工人们称赞自己的工地说：总路线放光芒，技术革命大开张。白天干活车上坐，夜间施工电灯亮，轻松愉快修铁路，全靠党的好主张。
    职工们还创制了许多大型动力机械，去年已经制成各种动力机械一百多台，制造各种车床七十七台，这些动力机械有：解决冬季施工挖冻土关键的“锯冻土机”，解决土方挖装关键的“挖装机”，还有“电动打夯机”等。
    现在，许多工地上已经看不到人挑人抬了。真是机器轰鸣、小车成群、轨道成网。随着机械化、半机械化施工的实现，这个局的劳动生产率大大提高。挖土效率由原来每人每天二点七四立方米提高到六点九五立方米，挖石方的效率由每人每天两立方米提高到四点二二立方米。去年第三季度，在隧道和桥梁施工方面，劳动生产率比1958年同期增长了20％到41％。全局提前五十六天完成了1959年施工计划。（附图片）
