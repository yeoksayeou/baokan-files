Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, January 11th: The Soviet representative, Zorin, to the Soviet, American, and British conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests, said here tonight that the success of this conference now depends on the attitude of the American delegation.

He further stated that the American delegation is delaying the signing of a treaty banning nuclear explosions. Upon arriving at the airport here from Moscow, Zorin told reporters that U.S. President Eisenhower's announcement of the U.S. intention to resume nuclear testing would have a "very bad impact on the current situation."

A reporter asked what the attitude was of the Western countries, who reportedly advocated joint nuclear explosions by countries with nuclear weapons. The Soviet representative replied that there had been no such proposal. He added: "However, in any case, continuing nuclear explosions would be a step backward. The Soviet Union advocates discontinuing all explosions. This has always been our position, and we have demonstrated this position."

Before the conference adjourned on December 19th, the Soviet delegation put forward an important compromise proposal, asking the West to accept the Soviet proposal for a "three-one-three-one" formula for the composition of the Supervisory Commission (i.e., three Eastern representatives, three Western representatives, and one representative from a neutral country), and agreed to accept the following two Western suggestions:

1. The one-third system for the staffing of monitoring stations, i.e., one-third of the personnel at the monitoring stations would be from the host country, one-third from the other two nuclear powers, and the rest from non-nuclear countries.

2. Decisions on budget and financial matters in the Supervisory Commission require a two-thirds majority.

Zorin said: "We are waiting for the West's reply. If the Soviet proposal is accepted, it will be possible to sign the treaty quickly.

"We hope to sign the treaty before the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference in Geneva begins its work on March 15th."

U.S. representative Wadsworth, upon arriving here, said that he had not yet received instructions on what attitude the United States should take towards the Soviet proposals. He said that new instructions "may" not arrive when the conference resumes.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, January 12th: The Soviet, American, and British conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests resumed here on the afternoon of the 12th after a three-week recess.

Soviet representative Zorin said in response to a reporter's question that there was "nothing new" at today's meeting.

Today's meeting was chaired by Zorin. He suggested that the meeting consider the Soviet proposal put forward on December 14th of last year. The purpose of the Soviet proposal is to resolve the issues of the composition of the Supervisory Commission, the staffing of monitoring stations, and the budget and finances of the monitoring organization as soon as possible.

The Soviet representative demanded that a decision on the quota of inspections be made immediately. The Soviet Union proposed a suggestion concerning the quota of inspections back in April of last year, but the United States has not yet responded to the Soviet proposal.

It is reported that the Western representatives continued to insist on their ambiguous attitude at the meeting today and emphasized some so-called difficulties that arose, which reportedly arose because the experts from the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain failed to reach an agreement on the guidelines for dispatching inspection teams at the meeting in December of last year.

The U.S. representative insisted in his speech today that underground nuclear explosions are fundamentally impossible to detect. The press here believes that the U.S. delegation's attitude is preparing the ground for the U.S. to refuse to ban underground nuclear testing.

It is worth noting that a message published in the latest issue of the American "Time" magazine said that the United States is actively preparing to resume nuclear weapons testing in Nevada in May, June, or July of this year.

### 苏联出席不继续试验核武器会议代表发表谈话  禁止核爆炸条约不能签字责在美国

    苏联出席不继续试验核武器会议代表发表谈话
    禁止核爆炸条约不能签字责在美国
    据新华社日内瓦11日电  出席苏、美、英三国不继续试验核武器会议的苏联代表查拉普金今天晚上在这里说，这个会议是否能够成功，现在取决于美国代表团的态度。
    他又说，美国代表团使禁止核爆炸的条约迟迟不能签字。查拉普金在从莫斯科到达这里的机场时对报界说，美国艾森豪威尔总统宣布美国打算恢复核试验一事，将对“目前的局势造成很坏的影响。”
    有记者问，有消息说，西方国家主张由有核武器的国家举行联合核爆炸，它们的态度到底怎样。这位苏联代表回答说，并没有这方面的建议。他又说：“但是，在任何情况下，继续进行核爆炸都将是一个退步。苏联主张不继续进行一切爆炸。这始终是我们的态度，我们已经表明了这种态度。”
    苏联代表团在12月19日会议休会之前提出了一个重要的折衷建议，要求西方接受苏联关于监督委员会组成的三一三一制（即三个东方代表，三个西方代表和一个中立国代表）方案，并且答应接受西方下列两项建议：
    一、关于监督站人员配备的三分之一制方案，即：在监督站的人员中，三分之一是东道国的人员，三分之一是其它两个核国家的人员，其余的是非核国家的人员。
    二、在监督委员会里对预算和财政问题作出决定时须有三分之二的多数。
    查拉普金说：“我们正在等待西方的答复。如果接受苏联的建议，就有可能使条约迅速得到签订。
    “我们希望在3月15日日内瓦十国裁军会议开始工作之前签订条约。”
    美国代表华兹沃斯在到达这里以后说，他还没有收到关于美国对苏联建议应采取什么态度的指示。他说，在会议复会的时候，新的指示“可能”不会抵达。
    新华社日内瓦12日电　苏、美、英三国不继续核武器试验会议在休会三个星期以后12日下午在这里复会。
    苏联代表查拉普金在回答记者的问题时说，在今天的会议上“没有什么新东西”。
    今天会议由查拉普金主持。他建议会议考虑苏联在去年12月14日提出的建议。苏联建议的目的在于早日解决监督委员会的组成、监督站的人员配备和监督组织的预算和财务等问题。
    苏联代表要求对视察次数定额立即作出决定。苏联早在去年4月间就提出了关于视察次数定额的建议，可是美国直到目前为止还没有答复苏联的建议。
    据悉，西方代表今天在会上继续坚持他们的含混态度，并且强调会上产生的一些所谓困难，这些困难据说是由于苏、美、英三国的专家在去年12月的会议上未能就派遣视察小组的准则问题达成协议而产生的。
    美国代表今天在发言中坚持，地下核爆炸是根本无法侦察的。这里的报界人士认为，美国代表团的这种态度是为美国拒绝禁止在地下试验核武器准备理由。
    值得注意的是，上一期美国“时代”周刊刊载的一则消息说，美国正在积极准备在今年5、6月或7月在内华达恢复核武器试验。
