The majestic Liupan Mountain stands tall in the Guyuan Prefecture of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. It rises to an elevation of about 2,500 meters. Ascending to the summit of Liupan Mountain, one looks down and sees the winding road below. In 1935, our great leader Chairman Mao, leading the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army on the world-renowned Long March, wrote a heroic poem here as they were about to reach northern Shaanxi:

	The sky is high, the clouds are pale,
	Southward fly the wild geese, vanishing.
	If we fail to reach the Great Wall, we are not true men,
	We have already travelled twenty thousand li!
	On the crest of Liupan Mountain
	The crimson banner is unfurled in the wind.
	When shall we have the long cord in our hands
	To bind fast the Grey Dragon?

Liupan Mountain is a treasure mountain. On its main and branch ridges, there are over 1.5 million mu of forest, including more than 300,000 mu of bamboo forest. There are about 150 species of trees, including timber forests and economic forests. For example, Armand pine, oil pine, and juniper are excellent timber for construction and are currently being developed. Ginkgo, mountain peach, and mountain hawthorn are excellent rootstocks for grafting fruit trees. A large portion of these trees have long, vine-like branches, soft and slender, which can be used to weave tools and farm implements. Therefore, the mountain goods woven here sell well in many places.

Liupan Mountain also produces more than 120 kinds of medicinal herbs. The Hui and Han people at the foot of the mountain use their spare time to collect herbs, process them, and supply them to meet domestic and international needs. From January to October 1959, the entire prefecture purchased more than 274,000 jin of medicinal materials. The wild plants and fruits produced on the mountain can also be used to manufacture starch, fiber, and to brew wine. There are also many rare birds and animals here, including roe deer, deer, and otters. Every spring and summer, hundreds of flowers bloom on the mountain, with more than 40 kinds of exotic flowers and plants.

The underground resources here are also very rich, including more than ten kinds of minerals such as iron, coal, lead, oil shale, clay, and rare metals. In 1958, the Guyuan Prefecture launched a massive iron and steel smelting campaign here. Now, dozens of county-run and commune-run factories of various kinds have been established at the foot of Liupan Mountain. The rich underground resources of Liupan Mountain are being gradually utilized with the rapid development of socialist construction. The Hui and Han people in the mountainous areas are making great efforts to develop diversified economies, "relying on the mountain, living off the mountain, and nurturing the mountain," taking advantage of the superiority of the people's communes. Liupan Mountain will become more and more prosperous and beautiful under the management of the people.

    六盘山是万宝山
    气势雄伟壮丽的六盘山，横亘在宁夏回族自治区南部的固原专区。海拔两千五百米左右。登上六盘山顶峰，俯视山下，公路蜿蜓而上。1935年我们伟大的领袖毛主席，率领中国工农红军进行举世闻名的二万五千里长征，在即将到达陕北时，曾经在这里写下了气壮山河的诗篇：
    天高云淡，
    望断南飞雁。
    不到长城非好汉，
    屈指行程二万！
    六盘山上高峰，
    旄头漫卷西风。
    今日长缨在手，
    何时缚住苍龙？六盘山是一座万宝山。在它的主脉和支脉上，有一百五十多万亩森林，其中竹林有三十多万亩。树木品种约有一百五十多种，有用材林，也有经济林。如华山松、油松、圆柏、桦树等，是优良的建筑用林，目前正在开发。银杏、山桃、山荆等是嫁接果树的优良砧木。这些树木中还有很大一部分披条，犹如藤萝，柔软细长，可以编制工具、农具等，所以这里生产的山货编织畅销很多地方。
    六盘山上还出产药材一百二十多种。山下的回汉人民都利用农闲空隙上山采药，经过加工，供应国内外需要。1959年元月到10月，全专区共收购药材二十七万四千多斤。山上出产的野生植物和野果，还可以制造淀粉、纤维和酿酒。这里珍禽异兽也很多，其中有獐、鹿、水獭等。每年春夏，山上百花争艳，有各种奇异的花草四十多种。
    这里地下宝藏也很丰富，已发现的有铁、煤、铅、油页岩、粘土以及稀有金属等十几种。1958年固原专区在这里掀起了千军万马的大炼钢铁高潮，现在，六盘山下已建立县办和社办的各种工厂几十个。六盘山地下丰富的资源，随着社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，逐步被利用起来。山区的回汉人民利用人民公社的优越性，大力开展多种经营，“靠山、吃山、养山”。六盘山在人们的经营下，将变得愈来愈富饶美丽。
