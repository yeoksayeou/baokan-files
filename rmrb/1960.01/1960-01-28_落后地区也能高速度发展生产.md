Backward Regions Can Also Develop Production at High Speed
Wang Mingsan, First Secretary of the Jinbei Prefectural Committee of the CPC

    In 1959, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the Jinbei area held high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and won a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. Industrial production exceeded the annual plan forty days ahead of schedule, with the total output value increasing by 35% compared to 1958; agricultural production achieved a huge bumper harvest, with the total grain output increasing by 15% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries all developed greatly. The total agricultural output value increased by 30% compared to 1958. The income and living standards of the broad masses of the people have also greatly improved. With the rapid development of economic construction, cultural arts, and scientific education have also greatly developed. The "poor and blank" face of the Jinbei area has undergone and is undergoing profound changes.

    Comprehensive Development, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry First

    The continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 proved that in economically backward areas, it is possible to develop production at high speed. To develop production at high speed, it is necessary to resolutely implement a series of policies and instructions of the Party in accordance with local conditions.
    The people of Jinbei deeply feel the characteristics of being "poor and blank." Before liberation, due to the cruel plunder by successive ruling classes, resources were severely damaged, soil and water were lost, cultivation was extensive, and yields were extremely low, with an average yield of sixty to seventy catties per mu, making it one of the low-yield areas in North China. The working people lived a long life of not being able to cover their bodies or fill their stomachs. However, "poor but ambitious, wanting to work, wanting to revolt" also profoundly reflects the will of the people of Jinbei. Because the people of Jinbei are eager to get rid of poverty, and because Jinbei has a vast territory and abundant material resources, and at the same time has accumulated a lot of production experience since liberation, these are all favorable conditions for developing production at high speed. According to the Central Committee's instructions on taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing agricultural production, the Prefectural Committee, in April 1959, proposed the principle of "comprehensive development, with agriculture and animal husbandry as the first priority" in accordance with local conditions. Under the guidance of this specific policy, in terms of agricultural production, in view of the characteristics of low and unstable yields in our region, a system of basic farmland was implemented. Water, fertilizer, and intensive cultivation were added to the basic farmland to achieve high yields and more harvests. At the same time, a large amount of arable land was used as non-basic farmland, and multiple varieties were grown to achieve multiple harvests, and pasture bases were established. In terms of the cultivation system, single-season crops were changed to two-season crops, and low-yield crops were changed to high-yield crops, effectively guaranteeing the continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.
    Jinbei suffers from drought nine years out of ten, and vigorously grasping water conservancy is of great significance for developing agricultural production. After two years of hard work, a total of 4.38 million mu of irrigated land has been newly added, an increase of 140% compared to the original irrigated land, making 66% of the basic farmland irrigated. Great achievements have also been made in soil and water conservation. In the high-speed development of water conservancy, we have adhered to the "three main" principles of emphasizing storage, small scale, and community management. According to the different natural characteristics of various parts of the region, we have built water networks connecting canals, reservoirs, wells, and ponds in the plains; built reservoirs and dug mountain diversion canals in the mountainous areas to develop highland irrigation; and drilled through mountains, intercepted undercurrents, and dug drought wells in the hilly areas to vigorously develop small-scale water conservancy, thereby greatly accelerating the development of water conservancy construction in the entire region. The great development of water conservancy construction not only provided conditions for the high-speed development of agricultural production, ending the history of "nine years out of ten with no harvest," but also created conditions for the development of aquaculture. Now, more than 50 million fish fry have been stocked in reservoirs throughout the region, and the cold Saiwai Plateau is about to become a land of fish and rice.
    Our region has vast natural pastures and has superior conditions for developing animal husbandry. In 1959, under the guidance of the principle of "agriculture and animal husbandry first," with collective breeding as the main focus and private breeding as a supplement, we launched a movement for raising fifteen kinds of animals, including pigs, cattle, sheep, mules, horses, donkeys, camels, chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, bees, silkworms, and fish. We adopted eight measures to solve problems related to water, grass, feed, breeding (improving varieties), reproduction, management, disease prevention, and tool reform. Animal husbandry has achieved unprecedented development. Among them, the development speed of pigs and sheep is the fastest, with pigs increasing by 73.5% and sheep increasing by 27%. The great development of animal husbandry has added hundreds of millions of dan of organic fertilizer to farmland, which has played a huge role in improving agricultural production.
    Forestry is a production of basic construction. We have adopted a combination of centralized afforestation and decentralized planting, a combination of timber forest construction and economic forest construction, a combination of shock afforestation and regular protection, a combination of key breakthroughs and general development, a combination of immediate interests and long-term interests, and a combination of collective management and individual management. In the past year, forestry production has made great progress. A total of more than 3.3 million mu of forest land has been afforested in large patches, and more than 240 million trees have been planted sporadically. The development of forestry production has greatly changed the natural landscape, reduced wind and sand disasters, and initially beautified the land.
    With the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, incomes have greatly increased. In 1959, the income of people's communes from diversified operations alone was nearly 100 million yuan, with an average income of more than 28 yuan per agricultural population, accounting for 27.7% of the total agricultural production income.

    Poor and Rich Help Each Other, Common Leap Forward

    The realization of the people's commune has created conditions for the comprehensive development of the rural economy and the active narrowing of the gap between poor and rich areas. Therefore, party committees at all levels throughout the region have strengthened their leadership over the production of poor management areas in the process of organizing production, just like they did in the past when grasping advanced areas, and organized a mass movement for the poor to catch up with the rich. In February and March of last year, in summarizing the experience of Liushupo in Fanshi County, Yanfeng in Xinding County, Yanshanwu in Zuoyun County, and other management areas in turning from poor to rich, we realized that the main reasons for the poverty of poor areas were that natural conditions were not fully utilized, production funds and technical labor were relatively lacking, and in particular, the spirit of the people of being poor but ambitious was not fully brought into play. In April of the same year, the Prefectural Committee made a decision to have the poor catch up with the rich, proposing that those who are poor should be ambitious, rely on their own efforts, the poor and rich should help each other, and make a common leap forward. According to this decision, party organizations at all levels widely organized discussions among the masses, investigated the reasons, found the roots, proposed measures, and formulated plans, and sent more than 1,100 cadres and transferred more than 800 cadres to work in poor management areas for a long time to help with the work. With the gradual deepening of the movement, leaders at all levels constantly carried out inspections and ranking, planted red flags, and established pacesetters, and solved practical difficulties, thus achieving remarkable achievements. Experience has proved that the development of the movement for the poor to catch up with the rich not only stimulated the enthusiasm of the people in the poor areas, enabling the average income of members of most poor management areas to reach more than 40 yuan; some caught up with the level of the rich areas, narrowing the gap between the poor and the rich; but also 2,155 wealthy management areas, promoted by the movement for the poor to catch up with the rich, increased their average income by 20% compared to 1958. In this way, a socialist production competition in which the poor catch up with the rich and the rich help the poor and become rich together has been vigorously launched.
    The rapid economic development of poor management areas has provided conditions for strengthening the commune economy. The continuous development of the commune economy has accelerated the speed of the poor catching up with the rich. In order to help the poor management areas catch up with the rich management areas faster, in 1959, all communes in the region, in addition to taking out more than 1 million yuan to directly support production in poor areas, also played a huge role in organizing production, allocating labor, providing technical support, and carrying out large-scale cooperation.

    Mobilizing the Masses, Revolutionizing Technology

    The continuous upsurge of the production movement is inseparable from the continuous improvement of the masses' enthusiasm for labor and technical proficiency. Jinbei is vast and sparsely populated, and in the process of developing production at high speed, there is a particular feeling of a shortage of labor. This is not a bad thing, as long as we rely on the wisdom and strength of the masses, fully tap the potential of labor, and vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution centered on tool reform, the problem of labor shortage can not only be solved, but also push agricultural technical innovation to a new climax.
    In the past year, a socialist labor competition movement of "red, diligent, and clever" has been launched throughout the region. As a result of this movement, advanced models of one person equaling two people and one day equaling several days of work have gone from individuals to collectives, from local areas to the whole, and from high attendance to high efficiency and high quality. The "catching up, surpassing, and raising high" movement of poor areas catching up with rich areas, disaster years catching up with bumper years, backward areas catching up with advanced areas, measures catching up with indicators, enthusiasm surpassing measures, labor surpassing quotas, high-speed construction, high-quality work, and high production income has developed in this way. Through this competition movement, not only has labor efficiency been increased by about 20%-30%, but also a new social atmosphere has been created, and the relationship between people and between collectives has undergone profound changes.
    Along with the development of the movement, the mass movement of cleverly reforming tools, innovating technology, asking for labor from tools, and asking for power from water, fire, wind, and electricity has developed by leaps and bounds. Aerial ropeways were erected in Baode County, which is full of mountains, realizing high-altitude transportation. Many places have realized transportation vehicleization, semi-mechanization, and mechanization. 40% of the management areas in the region have realized the mechanization of rice milling and flour grinding. What is particularly gratifying is that Xinding County, with local industry as its base, has established an agricultural technical transformation network and become the pioneer of the region in marching towards agricultural modernization. On the basis of basically realizing water conservancy, they have built 50 hydropower stations and 100 hydraulic power stations; they have formed a county-wide mechanization system with large factories leading small factories and small factories leading handicraftsmen and skilled craftsmen; they have comprehensively processed saline-alkali and niter on the basis of improving saline-alkali land and produced large amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides; in 1959, they basically realized the vehicleization of transportation, the ball bearing of rotating tools, and the power of rice milling and flour grinding. The self-made native fertilizer averaged 32 catties per mu of land, 40% of the crops used self-made pesticides, more than 23,000 new and rebuilt vehicles of various types, and more than 72,000 pieces of disc harrows, double-furrow plows, walking plows, dredgers, generators, and power grinders were produced, and 100 machine tools of various types were produced, equipping the machinery factories of 20 communes. The support of industry to agriculture has not only increased agricultural labor productivity many times over, but also pushed the agricultural technical transformation movement to a new stage.
    The revolutionary zeal of the masses is inseparable from the leadership of the Party and putting politics in command. In all work, party committees at all levels throughout the region have always armed the whole party and the whole people with the spirit of the General Line. In terms of specific methods, we have adopted the method of constantly summarizing experience, constantly proposing new tasks, and using new experience and new tasks to improve and stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses; inspection, evaluation, and on-site meetings have become a system, and this method is used to summarize and promote various advanced experiences in a timely manner; planting red flags, establishing pacesetters, having red flags in every sector, having pacesetters in every industry, vigorously grasping positive factors, and commending advanced figures; combining the top and the bottom, combining the inside and the outside, and sticking to the end, so that leaders and the masses are combined.
    At present, the people of the entire region are advancing victoriously with soaring revolutionary zeal. More than one million people are engaged in water management and fertilizer accumulation on a large scale, and are developing animal husbandry centered on pig raising at high speed; in the "red, diligent, and clever" movement of technical innovation, they are following the path of Xinding County, establishing local industrial bases, and preparing conditions for agricultural modernization.

    落后地区也能高速度发展生产
    中共晋北地委第一书记　王铭三
    1959年，晋北地区的人民，在党的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，赢得了更大更好更全面的跃进。工业生产提前四十天超额完成了年计划，总产值比1958年增长35％；农业生产获得了巨大的丰收，粮食总产量比大跃进的1958年增长了15％，农、林、牧、副、渔业全面大发展。农业总产值比1958年增长了30％。广大人民群众的收入和生活也有了很大提高。随着经济建设迅速地发展，文化艺术、科学教育事业也有很大发展。晋北地区“一穷二白”的面貌已经和正在发生着深刻的变化。
    全面发展　农牧为先
    1958年和1959年连续大跃进证明：在经济落后地区，是能够高速度发展生产的。要高速度发展生产，就必须因地制宜地坚决贯彻党的一系列方针政策和指示。
    “一穷二白”的特点，晋北人民感受十分深刻。这个地区在解放前由于历代统治阶级的残酷掠夺，资源横遭破坏，水土流失，耕作粗放，产量极低，平均亩产六、七十斤，成为华北的低产区之一。劳动人民长期过着衣不蔽体、食不果腹的生活。但是，“穷而有志，要干，要革命”，又深刻地反映了晋北人民的意志。由于晋北人民急于要求摆脱贫困，又由于晋北土地辽阔，有丰富的物质资源，同时解放以后积累了很多的生产经验，这些都是高速度发展生产的有利条件。根据中央关于以粮为纲全面发展农业生产的指示，地委在1959年4月间，因地制宜地提出了“全面发展，农牧为先”的方针。在这一具体方针指导下，在农业生产方面，根据我区产量低且不稳定的特点，实行了基本农田制，在基本农田中加水加肥加工，实行高产多收。与此同时，又把大量可耕土地作为非基本农田，实行多种多收，并建立牧草基地。在耕作制度上，变一季作物为两季作物，变低产作物为高产作物，有效地保证了农业生产的连续大跃进。
    晋北十年九旱，狠抓水利对于发展农业生产有着十分重大的意义。经过最近两年的奋战，共新增水地四百三十八万亩，比原有水地增长了140％，使66％基本农田实现水利化。水土保持也获得了很大成绩。在高速度发展水利事业上，我们坚持了以蓄为主、小型为主和社办为主的“三主”方针，根据全区各地不同的自然特点，在平川区大搞渠、库、井、塘相连的水网化；在山区兴修水库，大挖转山渠，发展高地灌溉；在丘陵地带穿山打洞，截潜流，打旱井，大搞小型水利，从而大大加快了全区水利建设的发展速度。水利建设大发展，不仅为高速度发展农业生产提供了条件，结束了“十年九不收”的历史，而且为发展水产业创造了条件。现在全区在水库中放养的鱼苗已达五千多万尾，气候寒冷的塞外高原，行将变成鱼米之乡。
    我区有广大的天然牧场，具有发展畜牧业的优越条件。1959年在“农牧为先”的方针指导下，以集体饲养为主，私养为辅，开展了养猪、牛、羊、骡、马、驴、骆驼、鸡、鸭、鹅、兔、蜂、蚕、鱼等十五养运动，采取了解决水、草、料、种（改良品种）、繁（繁殖）、管（管理）、防（防疫）、工（工具改革）等八项措施，畜牧业得到空前大发展。其中以猪、羊的发展速度最快，猪比原来增长73．5％，羊增长了27％。畜牧业的大发展，为农田增加了亿万担有机质肥料，对提高农业生产起了巨大作用。
    林业是一项带基本建设性的生产。我们采取了集中营造与分散种植相结合、营造木材林与经济林相结合、突击造林与经常保护相结合、重点突击与一般发展相结合、眼前利益与长远利益相结合、集体经营与个人经营相结合的六结合方法，一年来林业生产有巨大发展。全年共营造成片林三百三十多万亩，零星植树二亿四千余万株。林业生产的发展，大大改变了自然面貌，减少了风砂灾害，初步美化了大地。
    农林牧副渔全面发展，收入大大增加。1959年，各人民公社仅多种经营一项的收入即近一亿元，每个农业人口平均收入二十八元多，占农业生产总收入的27．7％。
    穷富相帮　共同跃进
    人民公社化的实现，对全面发展农村经济，积极缩小穷区与富区之间的差别，创造了条件。因此，全区各级党委在组织生产的过程中，都像过去抓先进一样地加强了对穷管理区的生产领导，组织了穷赶富的群众运动。在去年2、3月间，我们在总结繁峙县柳树坡、忻定县岩峰、左云县沿山吾等管理区由穷变富的经验中，认识到穷区所以穷的主要原因是自然条件未被充分利用，生产资金、技术劳力比较缺乏，特别是人民群众穷而有志的思想没有充分地发挥出来。同年4月间，地委做出了穷赶富的决定，提出了穷而有志，自力更生，穷富相帮，共同跃进。各级党组织根据这一决定，广泛组织群众讨论，查原因，找根源，提措施，订计划，并派出了一千一百多干部，下放了八百多名干部长期驻在穷管理区帮助工作。随着运动的逐步深入，各级领导不断的进行了检查排队，插红旗、树标兵，解决实际困难，因而取得了显著成就。经验证明，穷赶富运动的开展，不仅激发了穷区人民的干劲，使绝大部分穷管理区社员平均收入达到四十元以上；一部分赶上了富区的水平，缩小了穷富之间的差别；而且有二千一百五十五个富裕管理区，在穷赶富运动的促进下，平均收入比1958年提高了20％。这样，穷赶富，富帮穷，共同富裕的社会主义生产竞赛就蓬勃地展开了。
    穷管理区经济的迅速发展，为壮大公社经济提供了条件。而公社经济的不断发展，又加快了穷赶富的速度。为了帮助穷管理区更快地赶上富管理区，全区各公社1959年除拿出一百余万元直接支援了穷区生产外，还从组织生产、劳力调配、技术支援、大搞协作等方面发挥了巨大的作用。
    发动群众　革新技术
    生产运动不断高涨，是和群众劳动积极性、技术熟练程度不断提高分不开的。晋北地广人稀，在高速度发展生产的过程中，劳动力尤其感到不足。这并不是坏事，只要我们依靠群众的智慧和力量，充分挖掘劳动潜力，大搞以工具改革为中心的技术革新和技术革命，劳动力不足的问题不仅可以解决，而且可以把农业技术革新推向一个新高潮。
    一年来，全区范围内开展了“红、勤、巧”的社会主义劳动竞赛运动。这一运动开展的结果，一个人顶两个人，一日作几日活的先进标兵已由个人到集体，由局部地区到全面，由高出勤到高工效、高质量。穷区赶富区，灾年赶丰年，落后赶先进，措施赶指标，干劲超措施，劳动超定额，建设高速度，做活高质量，生产高收入的“赶超高”运动就是这样发展起来的。通过这个竞赛运动，不仅使劳动效率提高20％—30％左右，而且造成了一种新的社会风尚，人与人、集体与集体之间的关系发生了深刻的变化。
    伴随着运动的开展，巧改工具，革新技术，向工具要劳力，向水、火、风、电要动力的群众运动有了突飞猛进的发展。在多山的保德县架设了索道，实现了高空运输；许多地方实现了运输车子化、半机械化和机械化；全区40％的管理区已实现了碾米磨面动力化。特别可喜的是，忻定县以地方工业为基地，建立农业技术改造网，成为全区向农业现代化进军的先锋。他们在基本实现水利化的基础上，兴建了五十个水电站，一百处水动力站；以大厂带小厂，小厂带手工工人和能工巧匠，形成了全县范围的机械化体系；以改良盐碱地为基础，综合加工盐碱硝，大造化肥、农药；1959年已基本实现了运输车子化，运转工具滚珠轴承化，碾米磨面动力化。自制的土化肥每亩土地平均达三十二斤，40％的农作物用上了自制的农药，新制和改制各种车辆两万三千余辆，圆盘耙、双铧犁、步犁、挖泥机、发电机、动力磨达七万二千余件，生产各种机床一百部，装备了二十个公社的机械厂。工业对农业的支援，不仅使农业劳动生产率成倍成百倍地提高，而且使农业技术改造运动迈上了新阶段。
    群众的这种革命干劲，是和党的领导、政治挂帅分不开的。在各项工作中，全区各级党委始终以总路线的精神武装全党全民。在具体方法上，我们采取了不断总结经验，不断提出新的任务，用新经验、新任务来提高和激发群众的干劲；检查评比、现场会议已形成制度，用这种办法及时总结和推广了各种先进经验；插红旗、树标兵，块块有红旗，行行业业有标兵，大抓积极因素，表扬先进人物；上下结合、内外结合、一竿子插到底，使领导和群众结合起来。
    目前，全区人民正以冲天的革命干劲，乘胜前进。一百多万人在大搞治水积肥，高速度地发展以养猪为中心的畜牧事业；在技术革新的“红、勤、巧”运动中，走忻定县的道路，建立地方工业基地，为农业现代化准备条件。
