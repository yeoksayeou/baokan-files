    A Tibetan Woman Tractor Driver
    Wang Boqi
    Danzeng Cuomao has returned from the Xining Tractor Driver Training Class. When she carried her luggage and stepped into her home, her mother, grandmother, and two younger sisters all rushed to greet her, asking questions out of curiosity.
    "What does a tractor look like?"
    "Does it do more work than a yak?"
    These questions made Danzeng Cuomao giggle. After she answered these questions in detail, her mother eagerly asked, "Tractors are so useful, have you learned how to operate one?"
    "I've learned!"
    "Now that you've learned, you must work hard. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao!"
    That night, Danzeng Cuomao couldn't fall asleep for a long time. The painful years of her childhood and the past six months of her study life flashed through her mind one after another. This Tibetan girl, who just turned twenty-four this year, was already herding sheep for the herdboss at the age of eleven. At that time, even in the cold winter snow, she still wore a tattered old sheepskin coat and bare feet to herd sheep for the herdboss, and she was often beaten and scolded by the herdboss for no reason. Those bitter days were really hard to bear! Whenever she ran home hungry to cry to her mother, and her mother gave her the fried noodles she had begged for with tears in her eyes, Danzeng Cuomao strongly fantasized about a day when she could use her labor to feed all the poor brothers and sisters.
    In September 1958, when she represented the Jiegujiehe Road Agricultural Cooperative of Yushu County to Xining to attend the Qinghai Provincial Women Activists Representative Conference, the leaders of the Provincial Animal Husbandry Department told her that she was to go to the tractor driver training class to learn how to drive a tractor. This news made Danzeng Cuomao so happy that she almost jumped up. A few years ago, when there were just movies in Yushu, Danzeng Cuomao saw Liang Jun driving a tractor to reclaim wasteland, and she planted a seed of ideal in her heart: learn to drive a tractor and reclaim the wasteland of Yushu to grow crops. Now, the moment she had been looking forward to, actually driving a tractor, had finally arrived.
    After half a year of diligent study and hard work, under the education of the Party, Danzeng Cuomao finally learned to drive a tractor in the summer of 1959. Holding a certificate of merit as an excellent student, she came to the Shangbatang Beach of the Yushu County Tractor Station to reclaim wasteland. Batang, this large grassland, has more than 200,000 mu of reclaimable wasteland. When she stepped onto the driver's seat and the first plow turned over the twenty-centimeter-thick turf, and she saw the turf trembling beyond a foot, how can her inner excitement be described! It seemed that what was displayed in front of her was not a large expanse of newly turned land, but a boundless expanse of highland barley and rapeseed..., at that time, Yushu's grain would be inexhaustible, and there would be no need to transport grain here from Xining anymore.
    In the intense battle of reclaiming wasteland, in order to save time, they sometimes had to work twelve hours a day. However, after working, Danzeng Cuomao carefully checked and maintained the tractor every day, often working until late at night. When other comrades had already rested, she was still carefully applying grease and wiping the machine over and over again. The four of them drove one tractor and reclaimed more than 4,000 mu of wasteland in just over two months. Danzeng Cuomao was selected as an advanced producer by all the comrades in the station; their tractor was also recently rated as a Red Flag vehicle.
    Danzeng Cuomao not only worked hard herself, but also tried her best to help others in learning technology, culture, and life. Whenever she had time, she always took the initiative to help other comrades repair cars. In order to help Tibetan tractor drivers improve their skills, the station opened an amateur technical learning course. No one could be a translator. Although Danzeng Cuomao had just started learning Chinese and couldn't speak fluently, she bravely took on this task. Shortly after the tractor station was established, there were no cooks for a while. Every day, Danzeng Cuomao was always the first to get up and fetch enough water. Sometimes, due to busy work and the far distance to the construction site, someone had to be sent back to the station to cook and deliver food to the construction site. Everyone was very tired, so Danzeng Cuomao always rushed back to boil water and deliver the food to the construction site. When they came back from get off work, she always collected the most firewood that the comrades had chopped. She also often secretly took apart and washed the quilts and clothes of the male comrades. In Danzeng Cuomao, it seems that there is an inexhaustible and inexhaustible power.

    一个藏族女拖拉机手
    汪伯琦
    丹增错毛从西宁拖拉机驾驶员训练班学习回来了。当她背着行装跨进家门的时候，妈妈、奶奶和两个妹妹，一齐迎上来接她。好奇地问这问那。
    “拖拉机是啥样子？”
    “有没有牦牛干的活儿多？”
    这些问题，把丹增错毛问得格格地笑起来。在她详细地回答了这些问题后，妈妈急切地问道：“拖拉机的用处这样大，你学会啦。”
    “学会啦！”
    “学会了可要好好干哪，这是托毛主席的福啊！”
    这天晚上，丹增错毛久久不能入睡，童年时代的痛苦岁月，半年来的学习生活，又一幕一幕地在她的脑海里呈现了出来。这个今年刚满二十四岁的藏族姑娘，在她十一岁时，就已经给牧主放羊了。那时候，严冬下雪天，她依然披着破烂的老羊皮袄，光着脚为牧主放羊，而且还经常遭到牧主的无故打骂，这样的苦日子真是难熬啊！每当她饿着肚子跑回家向母亲哭诉，母亲含着泪把讨饭要来的炒面给她吃时，丹增错毛就强烈地幻想着有那样的一天，自己能够用劳动让贫苦的兄弟姐妹都吃饱肚子。
    1958年9月，她代表玉树县结古和平路农业合作社去西宁参加青海省妇女积极分子代表会议时，省畜牧厅的领导同志告诉她：要她去拖拉机驾驶员训练班学开拖拉机，这个消息使丹增错毛高兴得简直跳了起来。几年以前，还在玉树刚刚有电影时，丹增错毛看到梁军驾驶拖拉机开荒的场面后，心里就种下了理想的种子：学开拖拉机，把玉树的荒滩开出来种庄稼。如今，日日盼望的实际驾驶拖拉机的时刻终于来到了。
    经过半年的勤学苦练，在党的教育下，丹增错毛终于在1959年夏天学会了驾驶拖拉机，并且拿着优秀学员的奖状，来到了玉树县拖拉机站上巴塘滩开荒来了。巴塘，这一大片草滩，可以开垦的荒地有二十多万亩。当她登上驾驶台，第一铧把二十公分厚的草皮翻开，看到一尺以外的草皮都颤颤抖动时，她内心的激动该怎样描述啊！仿佛展示在她眼前的并不是大片新翻的土地，而是一望无际的青稞、油菜……，那时，玉树的粮食将会吃不完，用不尽，再也不要由西宁往这里运粮了。
    在紧张的开荒战斗中，为了抢时间，她们有时一天要劳动十二个小时。但是，丹增错毛在劳动罢后，每天都认真细致地检查和保养拖拉机，工作往往到深夜，别的同志已经休息了，她还在细心地打黄油，一遍一遍地擦机器。她们四个人驾驶的一台拖拉机，两个多月就开了四千多亩荒地。丹增错毛被全站同志评选为先进生产者；她们的拖拉机也在最近被评选为红旗车。
    丹增错毛不仅自己努力工作，同时在学技术、文化和生活上也尽力帮助别人。只要有空，她总是主动地帮助其他同志修车。为了帮助藏族拖拉机手提高技术，站里开办了业余技术学习课程，没有人能当翻译，丹增错毛虽然自己才开始学汉话，说不流利，但是她还是勇敢地把这一工作担当了下来。拖拉机站成立不久，一时没有炊事人员。每天，丹增错毛总是第一个起身，把水背足了。有时由于工作忙，工地远，要派人回站做饭往工地上送。大伙儿都很疲倦了，这时，丹增错毛总是抢着跑回去，烧好开水，把饭送到工地。下班回来，同志们打的柴火，也总是数她最多。男同志的被子、衣服，也常常被她悄悄地代为拆洗了。在丹增错毛身上，好像有着使不尽、用不完的力量。
