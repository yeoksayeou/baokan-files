(Combined dispatches) Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: According to the South Korean News Agency, on January 2nd, American soldiers of the U.S. 7th Division stationed in Dongducheon, near Seoul, seized two South Korean women who were walking nearby and forcibly shaved their heads bald with scissors and clippers in the barracks. When the women struggled and cursed the U.S. troops because of this humiliation, more than ten American soldiers surrounded them, making various lewd gestures and insulting them. Finally, they also used long brooms to mock the women's bald heads. The mastermind behind this atrocity was U.S. military officer McGinnery.

Victim Kim Soon-ae angrily told South Korean reporters: "This is not how humans should be treated. Americans don't treat us Koreans like human beings, that's why they did such a thing."

This atrocity by the American occupation forces in South Korea has aroused great indignation among the public in both North and South Korea.

The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea issued a statement at a press conference on the 7th, strongly condemning the crime of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea for forcibly shaving the heads of two Korean women.

The statement said: This crime of the U.S. military is an insult to the Korean nation, and it has aroused the anger of all Korean people.

The statement said that the U.S. military authorities stationed in South Korea actually described the incident as "due punishment" for the Korean women's "illegal intrusion" into the U.S. military area. This shameless and unreasonable sophistry makes the Korean people even more indignant.

The statement recalled a series of crimes committed by U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, such as raping women, using Korean farmers working in the fields as targets during flight training, and nailing Korean children into wooden boxes. The statement said that people throughout the Korean peninsula cannot suppress their anger at the atrocities of the U.S. military and resolutely demand that the U.S. military criminals be punished.

The statement demanded that the U.S. invading army immediately get out of South Korea. The statement said that if the U.S. invading army does not withdraw from South Korea and Korea does not achieve peaceful reunification, then all the misfortunes and sufferings of the South Korean people cannot be eliminated, and the atrocities of U.S. imperialism in South Korea will not end.

The statement called on the Korean people to fight to drive out the U.S. invading army and realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

Kim Young-soo, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's Union, issued a statement on the 7th, strongly condemning the U.S. military's crime. She said: All Korean women felt incomparable anger upon hearing this news, which shows that the U.S. military, rampaging in South Korea, treats Koreans like cattle and horses, arbitrarily insulting them.

She said that this national insult inflicted on South Korean women by the U.S. military is a continuation of the heinous crimes committed by the U.S. military in South Korea for fifteen years. As long as the U.S. military continues to occupy South Korea, the South Korean people and women cannot escape such misfortune and suffering. She said: In the name of all Korean women, I resolutely advocate that the U.S. military immediately withdraw from South Korea.

Pyongyang newspapers have published commentaries for days, strongly condemning this atrocity by the U.S. military. All newspapers demanded that the criminal U.S. military be severely punished and that the U.S. military withdraw from South Korea. "Labor News" published an article on the 7th, saying that killing, robbery, and rape are commonplace for the U.S. invading army. They often amuse themselves with atrocities that insult the Korean people, such as shaving women's heads, using children as shooting targets, nailing children in boxes, and putting dogs on the heads of the elderly. The article said that these atrocities reveal the nature of the invading army. "Democratic Korea" published a commentary on the 6th, saying that this barbaric atrocity by U.S. imperialists, which violates human dignity, is absolutely intolerable. "Pyongyang News" also published an article on the 7th, saying that in order to prevent such atrocities by U.S. imperialism in South Korea and to enable our brothers and sisters in South Korea to live like human beings, the U.S. invading army must withdraw from South Korea.

South Korean newspapers have also condemned the U.S. military's atrocity. On the 6th, all afternoon newspapers in Seoul exposed this atrocity with large headlines such as "Barbaric Act." "Chosun Ilbo" said that the incident was "brutal" and "we cannot but feel unpleasant and ashamed." An article in "Yonhap News" said that hearing about this "most cruel thing is shocking." Even some officials in the Syngman Rhee puppet regime expressed "shock."

    驻南朝鲜美军侮辱妇女的暴行激起抗议浪潮
    朝鲜人民要美军立即滚出南朝鲜
    本报综合报道　据新华社平壤电：据南朝鲜通讯社报道，驻在汉城附近的东头川里的美军第七师的美国兵在1月2日曾经把在附近走路的两名南朝鲜妇女捉到兵营里，用剪刀和推子等强行把她们的头发剃得光光的。当妇女们因受到这种侮辱而拚命挣扎并咒骂美军的时候，十多名美国兵围绕着她们作出各种下流的姿态，凌辱她们。最后还用扫地的长条帚戏弄这两名妇女的光头。这次暴行的主谋者是美军军官麦克盖纳里。
    受害者金顺爱愤怒地对南朝鲜记者说：“这不是对待人的行为，美国人把我们朝鲜人不当人看待，才作出了这样的事情。”
    美国在南朝鲜的占领军这一暴行引起北、南朝鲜公众极大的愤慨。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会议长团7日在记者招待会上发表声明，强烈谴责驻南朝鲜美军强行剃光两名朝鲜妇女头发的罪行。
    声明说：美军的这一罪行是对朝鲜民族的侮辱，它激起了全体朝鲜人民的愤怒。
    声明说，驻在南朝鲜的美军当局竟把这个事件说成是因为朝鲜妇女“非法侵入”了美军的军用地区而给予的“应有的处罚”，这种厚颜无耻、蛮不讲理的诡辩使朝鲜人民更加感到愤慨。
    声明追述了驻南朝鲜美军强奸妇女、在飞行训练时拿在田里耕作的朝鲜农民当标靶、把朝鲜少年钉入木箱等一系列的罪行。声明说，整个朝鲜土地上的人民都按捺不住对美军兽行的愤怒，坚决要求惩办美军罪犯。
    声明要求美国侵略军立即滚出南朝鲜。声明说，美国侵略军不从南朝鲜撤走，朝鲜得不到和平统一，那么南朝鲜人民的一切不幸和痛苦就不能消除，美帝国主义在南朝鲜的暴行也不会结束。
    声明号召朝鲜人民为赶走美国侵略军和实现祖国的和平统一而斗争。
    朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会副委员长金英秀7日发表谈话，强烈谴责美军这一罪行。她说：全体朝鲜妇女听到这一消息都感到无比的愤怒，这说明在南朝鲜横行霸道的美军把朝鲜人看成牛马一样，而任意侮辱。
    她说，美军这次给南朝鲜妇女的民族侮辱，是美军十五年来在南朝鲜进行令人发指的罪行的继续。只要美军继续强占着南朝鲜，南朝鲜人民和妇女就不能摆脱今天这样的不幸和痛苦。她说：我以全体朝鲜妇女的名义，坚决主张美军立即从南朝鲜撤走。
    平壤各报连日发表评论强烈谴责这一美军暴行。各报都要求严惩犯罪的美军，并且要求美军撤出南朝鲜。“劳动新闻”7日发表文章说，枪杀、抢劫、强奸是美国侵略军的家常便饭，他们经常以剃光妇女的头发，把儿童作射击标靶，把孩子钉在箱子里，把狗放在老人头上之类侮辱朝鲜人民的暴行来取乐。文章说，这些暴行揭示了侵略军的本色。“民主朝鲜报”6日发表评论说，美帝国主义者这一侵犯人类尊严的野蛮暴行是决不能容忍的。7日的“平壤新闻”也发表文章说，为了杜绝美帝国主义在南朝鲜的这类暴行，为了使南朝鲜的兄弟姐妹们能够过人的生活，美国侵略军必须从南朝鲜撤退。
    南朝鲜的报纸也纷纷谴责美军这一暴行。6日所有汉城的午报都以“野蛮的行为”的大字标题揭露这件暴行。“朝鲜日报”说，这件事是“残暴的”，“我们不能不感到不愉快和羞耻。”“联合新闻”的一篇文章说，听到这件“最残忍的事情是令人震惊的”。甚至李承晚傀儡政权中的一些官员也表示“震惊”。
