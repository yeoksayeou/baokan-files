    衡阳种子工作者提出倡议
    选育和推广更好更高产的良种
    据新湖南报消息　湖南省衡阳专区种子工作者向全省发出了全面革新低产品种，合理搭配品种，加强种子保管，提高种子质量，建立健全良种试验示范繁殖网，积极建立冬播作物种子基地，搞好良种经营，积极推广良种等十大倡议，呼吁全省种子工作者共同努力为今年农业生产备足优良种子。
    去年衡阳地区水稻良种面积达到六百二十万亩，占水稻播种总面积的93％，全区基本实现了良种化。为了进一步推广良种，全区根据普查、评比、鉴定和复查，从优中选优，共评选出水稻良种一百六十二个、花生良种四个、甘蔗良种五个、红薯良种三个、棉花良种一个、大豆良种九个，全面作出了1960年良种规划。
    根据规划，全区各地对所留种子逐仓逐队进行了摸底站队，基本摸清了种子的种类和数量。县与县、社与社、队与队之间互相挂钩，相互调剂，已调剂二千九百多万斤水稻、一百三十多万斤红薯、四百多万斤秋大豆及二百六十多万斤其他经济作物杂粮等种子。全专区各地都分专人、专仓，分品种、分等级保管种子，一般都做到了“无霉烂、无病虫、无潮湿、无事故、无鼠雀”。各地对良种繁育场也进行了整顿，对选种用的各种药剂也作了准备。
