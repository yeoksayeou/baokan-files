    From Cook to Innovation Expert
    Qing Song, Shi Ying
    Zong Chengmo and Wang Kewen, moving workers at the Dalian Heavy Machinery Plant, were both cooks in the cafeteria in the past. After working as movers for just over a year, they became creative experts in loading and unloading machinery.
    Revolutionary Energy "Pressed" Out
    The story of how they created the loading and unloading equipment is actually a very meaningful one.
    In 1958, during the factory's Great Leap Forward in production, the output of cranes more than doubled. At that time, comrades in the transportation section often complained that transportation capacity was insufficient. When this reached the ears of Zong Chengmo, a veteran cook in the cafeteria, the moving scenes of the Great Leap Forward immediately grabbed his heart. He said to his partner Wang Kewen:
      "Why don't we two go to the transportation section and contribute to the Great Leap Forward?" Wang Kewen agreed with Zong Chengmo's view.
    Before experiencing the heavy iron work, neither of them had any confidence, but after carrying it for a few days, they couldn't bear it anymore. One day, a car drove to the Dalian Steel Plant to pull round steel. When more than 100 kilograms of steel fell on Zong Chengmo's shoulders, a thought flashed in his mind immediately. He said to his partners:
      "Are we going to let this guy oppress us for the rest of our lives?"
      "If you don't get pressed, how can the steel get on the car?" said the old worker Yan Qinghu.
    Zong Chengmo said, "Production workers can find tricks, can't we make a machine to replace people carrying heavy iron?!"
    The Inspiration of Two Round Iron Balls
    That's what he said, but at the time, Zong Chengmo wasn't sure if he could find any tricks.
    Soon, their car pulled back four steel plates from Dalian Seaport. Each of these guys weighed more than a ton. Zong Chengmo was worrying about how to unload them, and the old loading and unloading worker Yan Qinghu waved his hand and commanded, "You three pry them with crowbars!"
    Zong Chengmo, Wang Kewen, and Lü Fengqi used all their strength to pry a gap in a steel plate, and then Yan Qinghu picked up two round iron balls from the ground and threw them into the gap with a clang. Then, they tied one end of the steel plate with a thick rope, and four people gently pulled the rope, and the more than one-ton steel plate was obediently dragged to the ground! This was the first time Lao Zong had unloaded a steel plate, and he encountered such a clever thing, and asked Yan Qinghu with surprise and joy:
      "Who came up with this method?"
    Lao Yan said, "Unloading steel plates is all this way, otherwise, how can you unload a steel plate of more than one ton!"
    A few days later, they pulled back a carload of I-beams from Dalian Seaport. This I-beam was fourteen meters long and weighed 750 kilograms. When unloading, Zong Chengmo, Wang Kewen, and Yan Qinghu each held a crowbar, and it took a lot of effort to unload the I-beam. After finishing the work, Zong Chengmo raised a question to his partners: "If round iron balls can unload steel plates, can't they unload I-beams?"
    This matter aroused Zong Chengmo's thoughts. That night, he and Wang Kewen went to warehouse No. 1 to explore the way. Zong Chengmo picked up a round iron ball from the ground and threw it on the angle steel, and the round iron ball rolled along the "V" shaped groove of the angle steel to the end. At this time, their brains suddenly opened up. They thought: if two angle steels are aligned into a "" shaped track, and round iron balls are placed in the middle, and a unloader is made, and then slender steel such as I-beams and angle steel are loaded on the unloader, and when unloading, the round iron balls roll in the "" shaped groove, wouldn't the entire car of steel slide to the ground. According to this idea, they found four old angle irons and ten round iron balls to make a unloader. After testing, it was very successful. In the past, to unload large and small steel, people had to pry them down one by one. With the unloader, it is very easy: put the unloader in the car box before loading, and load the steel on the unloader; when arriving at the unloading location, open the car box, and then pad a slope-shaped wooden board less than half a foot high on the rear wheel of the car, and when the car moves forward slightly and the rear wheel presses on the wooden board, the round iron balls in the unloader will slide, and the entire car of steel will slide down.
      Also Want to Mechanize Loading
    The creation of the unloader was successful, and it only cost more than three yuan to turn the heavy unloading labor into automation. While congratulating them on the success of this creation, the Party branch also put forward a new topic: it is not enough to automate unloading, and we must find ways to solve the problem of mechanized loading.
    In fact, the matter of mechanized loading has had an ideal in Zong Chengmo's mind since the day he became a mover. After the successful creation of the unloader, he became even bolder.
    One evening after work, he went to the street to get a haircut. When he walked to the window of a photo studio near the Shahekou Market, a photo in the window attracted him like a magnet. This photo showed a huge crane lifting a large ship into the air. Lao Zong thought: this guy can lift a ship, can't I make a small one and install it on a car to lift a thousand or eight hundred pounds? Thinking of this, he forgot about the haircut. He went straight to the home of his neighbor, Hu Deshan, a worker at the Dalian Chemical Plant. He met Lao Hu and said:
    "I want to install a small crane on the car to replace manual loading and unloading, is that possible?"
    "What kind of one do you want to make?"
    "A vertical pole, a support pole, a tie rod, plus a pulley and a steel wire rope!" Lao Zong said and gestured, and told everything he had seen and thought.
    Hu Deshan nodded after listening and gave him an idea: "The pulley plays a deceleration role, two pulleys can reduce the weight by half for two hundred pounds, it's better to have more pulleys!" Zong Chengmo happily accepted this suggestion.
    The next morning, Zong Chengmo took a drawing he had drawn to the Party branch. After reading the drawing and listening to his explanation, branch secretary Guo Shixue encouraged him and said, "Go ahead, Lao Zong, if you have any difficulties, find the Party branch!" Lao Zong felt full of energy when he heard this. Every day after get off work, he searched every corner of the factory for waste materials. After piecing it together, in more than ten days, a simple hand-cranked loading and unloading winch was made. This soil loading and unloading machine that can load and unload uses a steel wire rope to tie half a ton or a ton of steel ingots and hang them on the crane hook, and one person can easily lift them into the car box by shaking the pulley with one hand. Once, Zong Chengmo loaded 78 tons of steel alone in one afternoon.

    从炊事员到革新能手
    青松　世英
    大连起重机器厂搬运工人宗成谟和王克文，过去都是食堂里的炊事员。他们仅仅干了一年多的搬运工人，却成为装卸机具的创造能手。
    “压”出来的革命劲
    提起他俩创造装卸机具的事儿，实在是一段很有意味的故事。
    1958年工厂生产大跃进，起重机的产量一下子增加了一倍多。当时，运搬科的同志常吵吵运输力量不够。这话传到食堂宗成谟的耳朵里，大跃进的动人情景一下子抓住了这位老炊事员的心。他对伙伴王克文说：
      “咱俩何不到运搬科为大跃进出一把力？”王克文同意宗成谟的看法。
    没尝到扛大铁活以前，两人心里都没有个底，可是扛过几天以后，就有点吃不消了。一天，汽车开到大连钢厂拉圆钢，当一百多公斤重的钢材落到宗成谟的肩膀上时，他脑子里立刻闪出一个念头。他对伙伴们说：
      “难道咱们能让这家伙压一辈子？”
      “不挨压，钢材怎么上汽车？”老工人阎清湖说。
    宗成谟说：“人家生产工人都能找窍门，咱们就不能弄个机器代替人扛大铁？！”
    两个圆铁球的启发
    话是这么说，可是当时宗成谟也不敢保险准能找到什么窍门。
    不久，他们这辆汽车从大连海港拉回四张钢板。这家伙一张就有一吨多重。宗成谟正发愁没办法往下卸，老装卸工人阎清湖一摆手指挥道：“你们三个人用撬杠撬！”
    宗成谟、王克文、吕凤岐用尽全身力气把一张钢板撬开个缝，只见阎清湖从地下拣起两个圆铁球，当当地扔到缝隙里。接着，他们用一根粗绳子捆住钢板的一端，四个人轻轻一拉绳子，一吨多重的钢板就乖乖地被拖到地下来了！老宗这是头一次卸钢板，就遇到这么个巧事，又惊又喜地问阎清湖：
      “这是谁想的办法？”
    老阎说：“卸钢板都是这个办法，不然，一吨多重的钢板怎么能卸下来！”
    事隔几天，他们又从大连海港拉回一车工字钢。这工字钢一根就有十四米长，七百五十公斤重。卸车时，宗成谟、王克文、阎清湖三人各执一根撬杠，费了九牛二虎之力，才把工字钢卸下来。干完活，宗成谟向伙伴们提出了问题：“圆铁球能把钢板卸下来，就不能把工字钢卸下来？”
    这事引起了宗成谟的心思。当天晚上他就和王克文到一号仓库去摸索门路。宗成谟从地上拣起一个圆铁球，往角钢上一扔，圆铁球就沿着角钢的“V”型槽一直滚到尽头。这时他俩大脑豁然开朗起来。他们想：要是用两根角钢对成“”型轨道，中间放上圆铁球，做成一个卸车器，再把细长的工字钢、角钢之类的钢材装在卸车器上，卸车时，圆铁球在“”型槽里滚动，不就能把整车的钢材滑到地上。根据这个想法，他们找来四根旧角铁，十个圆铁球，做成卸车器。经过试验，非常成功。过去卸大型和小型钢材，要人一根一根往下撬。有了卸车器，就很省劲了：装车前把卸车器放在车箱里，把钢材装在卸车器上；到卸车地点，把车箱打开，然后在汽车的后轮垫上一块不到半尺高的坡形木板，汽车向前稍加开动，后轮压上木板时，卸车器里的圆铁球就滑动起来，成车的钢材便一滑而下。
      还要装车机械化
    卸车器创造成功了，仅仅花三元多钱，就把笨重的卸车劳动变成自动化。党支部在祝贺他们这项创造成功的同时，又提出了新的课题：卸车自动化了还不够，要想办法解决装车机械化的问题。
    其实，装车机械化的事情，从宗成谟当搬运工那天起就有个理想装在脑子里了。卸车器创造成功以后，他的胆子更壮了。
    一天晚上下了班，他到街上去理发。走到沙河口市场附近一家照像馆的橱窗前，橱窗里摆的一张照片像磁石似的吸引住了他。这张照片照的是一个庞大的吊车把一艘大船吊在半空。老宗想：这家伙能吊起一艘大船，我弄个小的，安在汽车上吊个千八百斤还不行？想到这里，理发的事就忘了。他径直奔到他的邻居、大连化工厂工人胡德山家里。见面就对老胡说：
    “我想在汽车上安个小吊，让它代替人力装卸成不成？”
    “你想弄个什么样的？”
    “一根立杆、一根支杆、一根拉杆，再加上一个滑轮和一根钢丝绳子！”老宗连说带比划，把刚才看到的和想到的统统说了出来。
    胡德山听了直点头，并给他出了个主意：“滑轮起减速作用，二百斤的东西用两个滑轮，体重就可以减轻一半，多弄几个滑轮好！”宗成谟高高兴兴接受了这个建议。
    第二天清早，宗成谟拿着自己画的一张图来到党支部。支部书记郭世学看了图，听了他的说明以后，鼓励他说：“干吧，老宗，有困难找党支部！”老宗一听，浑身是劲。每天晚上下班以后，他转遍工厂各个角落搜集废料。东拼西凑，十几天的工夫，一台结构简单的手摇装卸两用卷扬机制成了。这台能装能卸的土装卸机用钢丝绳子把半吨或一吨重的钢锭捆住挂在吊钩上，一个人一只手摇滑轮，就能轻而易举地吊进车箱。一次宗成谟一个人在一下午就装了七十八吨钢材。
