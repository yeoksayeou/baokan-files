Baotou Iron and Steel Company (Baogang) has actively promoted the pressure grouting method in concrete engineering since the Great Leap Forward. Construction speed has generally increased more than threefold, costs have been reduced by 10%, and the quality of the projects has met design requirements.

This new construction method is far superior to ordinary concrete construction methods. The ordinary method involves mixing cement, sand, and stone into concrete of appropriate consistency in a mixing plant, transporting it to the construction site, pouring it into molds, and compacting it with vibrating tools. The pressure grouting method involves directly transporting the stone to the construction site, layering it in the molds, and using mortar pumps to inject cement mortar into the gaps between the stones. This method eliminates a large amount of mixing equipment, reduces transportation equipment, and makes construction easier, greatly reducing the labor intensity of workers. Therefore, the new method is very popular among construction workers.

When Baogang used this method for the foundation construction of a 500-ton open-hearth furnace, it only needed thirty workers, two mortar mixers, and four mortar pumps. Two work shifts completed the construction of four hundred cubic meters of concrete. If the old construction method was used, it would require more than twice as many workers, six concrete mixers, and twenty vibrators, plus ten more dump trucks. Otherwise, it would take two to three times longer to complete. While Baogang was constructing, it made a pressure-grouted concrete test block according to the actual operating conditions to check the concrete strength, and the results fully met the design requirements. Later, when the foundation was凿开 (chiseled open) for observation, it was found to be very dense inside, with no voids.

The amount of concrete used in metallurgical industrial construction is very large. For example, an iron and steel complex with an annual output of 3.5 million tons requires at least 1.1 million cubic meters of concrete. The speed of concrete construction often affects the speed of construction. Now, Baogang, Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Taiyuan Iron and Steel, and other companies are promoting the pressure grouting method in some important projects, including the foundation of the main plant, the foundation of large equipment, the foundation of open-hearth furnaces, the foundation of mixers, the foundation of blast furnaces, and the foundation of chimneys.

Xinhua News Agency. Baotou Iron and Steel Company laid 7.4 kilometers of large-diameter prestressed reinforced concrete pipes on the Yellow River water diversion trunk line project, and water was delivered on August 4 last year. For more than four months, prestressed pipes and steel pipes have been jointly responsible for ensuring the production water supply for Baogang's No. 1 blast furnace, coking plant, and thermal power plant.

The steel consumption of this prestressed pipe is only a little more than 20% of that of steel pipes, and its technical performance is fully qualified. According to foreign experience, using prestressed pipes instead of steel pipes for water transmission can save about 90% of steel, reduce costs by about 30%, and extend the service life of the pipes by more than double.

The metallurgical industry consumes a large amount of water. Therefore, water transmission pipeline projects occupy a very important position in metallurgical construction. Inspired by advanced Soviet experience, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry found a way to replace steel water transmission pipes with prestressed pipes. This involves using ordinary reinforced concrete pipes, wrapping circumferential prestressed steel wires around their outer walls to pre-compress the pipe walls (similar to the principle of the bamboo hoops used in wooden buckets in our country), so that the pipes do not leak or crack under internal water pressure.

With the help of the Beijing Municipal Engineering Bureau and the Metallurgical Construction Research Institute, Baogang overcame many difficulties and built this large-diameter prestressed pipe after nearly two years of effort. This has found a broad path for expanding pipe material resources.

    包钢推广混凝土压力灌浆收效显著
    施工速度加快三倍以上  成本降低10％
    大口径预应力钢筋混凝土管输水情况良好
    本报讯　包头钢铁公司大跃进以来，在混凝土工程中积极推广了压力灌浆法，施工速度普遍加快了三倍以上，成本降低10％，工程质量也都达到了设计要求。
    这种新的施工方法比普通混凝土施工方法优越得多。普通方法是先在搅拌厂里将水泥、砂、石调成适当稠度的混凝土，然后运到工地浇灌在模型里，并用震动工具捣实；而压力灌浆法是直接将石子运到工地，分层填铺在模型里，用砂浆泵把水泥砂浆灌入石子缝隙。这种方法省掉了大量的搅拌设备，减少了运输设备，而且施工轻便，大大减轻了工人劳动强度。因此，广大建筑工人十分欢迎这个新方法。
    包钢在五百吨大平炉基础施工时采用这一方法，只配备了三十名工人、两台砂浆搅拌机、四台砂浆泵，两个工作班就完成了四百立方米混凝土施工任务。如果采用旧的施工方法，要增加工人两倍以上，要配备六台混凝土搅拌机、二十台震动器，另外还要多用十台翻斗汽车，否则，就需要延长工期二、三倍才能完成。包钢在施工的同时，就按实际操作条件做了一个压力灌浆混凝土试块来检查混凝土强度，结果完全符合设计要求。后来凿开基础进行观察，内部很密实，没有空洞。
    冶金工业建设的混凝土工程量是很大的，如一个年产三百五十万吨的钢铁联合企业至少有混凝土一百一十万立方米。混凝土施工速度的快慢，常常影响建设速度。现在，包钢、石钢、武钢、太钢等在一些比较重要的工程中都推行了压力灌浆法，包括主厂房基础、大型设备基础、大平炉基础、混铁炉基础、高炉基础、烟囱基础等。
    本报讯　包头钢铁公司在黄河引水干线工程上铺设大口径预应力钢筋混凝土管七点四公里，于去年8月4日通水。四个多月来，预应力管和钢管一直共同担负着保证包钢一号高炉、焦化厂及热电站等生产用水任务。
    这条预应力管管道用钢量只及钢管的20％多，在技术性能上完全合格。据国外经验，用预应力管代替输水钢铁管，可以节约钢材90％左右，造价可以降低30％左右，管道寿命可以延长一倍以上。
    冶金工业生产用水量很大。因此在冶金建设中输水管道工程占有相当重要的位置。冶金部在苏联先进经验启发下，找到了用预应力管代替输水钢铁管的办法。这就是利用普通钢筋混凝土管，在其外壁缠上环向预应力钢丝，使管壁预先受压（和我国民间使用的竹箍木桶的原理很相似），使管子在内水压工作条件下不漏裂。
    包钢在北京市政工程局和冶金建筑研究院的帮助下，经过将近两年的努力，克服了重重困难，建成了这条大口径预应力管。这就为扩大管材资源找到一条宽广的道路。
