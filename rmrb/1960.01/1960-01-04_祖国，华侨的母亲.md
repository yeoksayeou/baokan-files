    The Motherland, the Mother of Overseas Chinese
    Deng Ya, Returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia, Worker at Xianyou Sugar Factory, Fujian

    1959 has passed. In this year, like the people of the motherland, I felt proud and honored!

    I am a returned overseas Chinese. My family has lived abroad in Indonesia for four generations. In 1955, I returned to my beloved motherland. As soon as I stepped onto the soil of the motherland, I received motherly care from the Party and the government. The government successively assigned me to study at the Quanzhou Sugar Factory and the Fujian Machinery Factory, and covered all my living expenses during my studies. Later, I was assigned to work at the Xianyou Sugar Factory.

    When I came to the Xianyou Sugar Factory, the factory was being expanded, and many machines had to be manufactured by the factory itself. Whether we could manufacture the machines ourselves depended on whether we could make wooden molds. At that time, the leadership decided to manufacture a two-hundred-ton sugar machine, but there were no tools, no workbenches, no blueprints, and no skilled workers for making the wooden molds. At that time, I felt somewhat disappointed and embarrassed. The Party Secretary immediately saw my concerns and encouraged me, saying, "If there are no tools, we can add them; if there is no equipment, we can create it ourselves; if you haven't seen a two-hundred-ton sugar machine, I will take you to visit one. As long as we liberate our thinking, any miracle can happen!" The words of the Party Secretary enlightened me. The next day, he took me to visit the Jintian Sugar Factory, found the blueprints, and also sent four workers and three apprentices to form a wooden mold group. With everyone's concerted efforts, the wooden molds were made, the sugar machine was manufactured, and we ourselves had the ability to work independently. Later, we also jointly manufactured more than eighty new tools such as spoon files and forty-five-degree flat files, solving the difficulty of insufficient tools and saving expenses for the factory. In this way, our wooden mold group has maintained its advanced status since the second half of 1958, completing the production plan ahead of schedule every month. From mid-December of last year, we began working on the tasks for 1960.

    The motherland is leaping forward, and I am also growing up happily in her loving embrace. My political awareness and technical level are improving day by day, and I am now a fourth-grade technician. When I first returned to the country, I did not understand the language of the motherland, but now I can speak, read, and write it. Last year, I also went to Beijing to participate in the National Congress of Heroes. All of this makes me naturally think of my past life overseas. I never imagined that people who used to live like cattle and horses overseas have now become masters of the country and advanced producers. I engrave the Communist Party's and Chairman Mao's kindness, which is deeper than the sea, in my heart and will never forget it! I am determined to dedicate all my talents to the mother who nurtured my growth—the great motherland, the great Communist Party of China—in this new year!

    祖国，华侨的母亲
    印度尼西亚归国华侨福建仙游糖厂工人  邓亚
    1959年已经过去了。在这一年中，我和祖国人民一样，感到骄傲和自豪！
    我是一个归国华侨。我家四代，都侨居在印度尼西亚。1955年，才回到亲爱的祖国。刚踏入祖国的国土，就受到了党和政府母亲般的照顾。政府先后分配我到泉州糖厂、福建机器厂去学习，并且负担我在学习期间的全部生活费用。以后，又分配我到仙游糖厂工作。
    当我来到仙游糖厂的时候，厂里正在扩建，许多机器必须由厂里自己制造。能不能自制机器，决定于能不能做出木模。当时，领导上决定要制造二百吨的糖机，可是做木模没有工具、没有工作台、没有图纸、没有熟练的工人。那时我心里有些失望和感到为难。党委书记立即看出我的心事，鼓励我说：“没有工具，可以添置；没有设备，我们自己创制；你没有见过二百吨糖机，我带你去参观。只要解放思想，什么奇迹都会出现！”党委书记的话，使我的思想开了窍。他第二天就带我去锦田糖厂参观，找来了图纸，还派来四个工人和三个徒弟，成立了木模组。在大家齐心合作下，木模做起来了，糖机制造出来了，我们自己也有了独立工作的能力。以后，我们还共同制造了汤匙锉、四十五度平锉等八十多件新工具，解决了工具不足的困难，为工厂节省了开支。这样，我们的木模小组，从1958年下半年以来，一直保持先进，月月提前完成生产计划。从去年12月中旬，就开始干1960年的活了。
    祖国在飞跃前进，我也在慈母般的怀抱里幸福地成长起来。我的政治觉悟和技术水平一天天地提高，现在已经是四级技工了。刚回国时，不懂祖国的文字语言，现在也会说、会读、会写了。去年，我还上北京参加了全国群英会。这一切，使我很自然地联想到过去的海外生活。想不到过去在海外过着牛马般生活的人，今天也成了国家的主人，成为先进生产者了。我把共产党和毛主席比海还深的恩情铭刻在心上，永远不忘！我决心在这新的一年中，把自己的一切才能献给哺育我成长的母亲——伟大的祖国，伟大的中国共产党！
