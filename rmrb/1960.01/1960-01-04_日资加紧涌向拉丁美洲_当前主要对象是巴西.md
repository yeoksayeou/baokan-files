Japanese Capital Intensifies Inflow into Latin America
Currently Mainly Targeting Brazil

    This newspaper reports that Japanese monopoly capital is accelerating the establishment of its investment sphere of influence in Latin America. According to the December 1959 issue of the Soviet magazine "World Economy and International Relations," as of January 1959, the total amount of Japanese private foreign investment was $114.2 million, of which $40 million was invested in Latin American countries. Currently, Japanese private direct investment in Latin America ranks first among Japan's total private direct investment abroad.

    Brazil is the primary target for the expansion of Japanese monopoly capital in Latin America. There are twenty-three enterprises in Brazil that were established with Japanese capital. Several large enterprises are currently under construction with Japanese investment. The most important of these is the Minas steel plant. The total investment in this steel plant is $55 million, with Japanese capital accounting for $22 million, or 40%. Japanese companies are also providing all the equipment in the form of credit. Japan's "Onoda Cement Company" and "Asahi Glass Company" have respectively established joint venture cement and glass factories in Brazil. Japan's "Toyo Textile Company" and "Kanebo Textile Company" have established their own enterprises in Brazil. Japan's "Ishikawajima Heavy Industries" has invested as much as $8.3 million in the Brazilian shipbuilding industry. In addition, the 400,000 Japanese immigrants in Brazil are also actively involved in Brazil's industrial and agricultural sectors, becoming a strong pillar for the penetration of Japanese monopoly capital.

    In Chile, a group of companies from the Japanese Mitsubishi Zaibatsu has reached an agreement with Chile to establish an iron ore mining enterprise. "Nissan," a major Japanese automobile manufacturer, has decided to provide "technical assistance" to Chile for the construction of an automobile factory. Japan has reached an agreement with Peru to provide "technical assistance" to Peru for the construction of a fertilizer plant with an annual output of 64,000 tons. At the end of 1958, the "Japan Overseas Mineral Resources Development Association" sent a group of geologists to specifically survey Peru's natural resources.

    日资加紧涌向拉丁美洲
    当前主要对象是巴西
    本报讯　日本垄断资本正加紧在拉丁美洲建立自己的投资的势力范围。据1959年12月号苏联“世界经济与国际关系”杂志报道，截至1959年1月止，日本私人对外投资总额为一亿一千四百二十万美元，其中投在拉丁美洲国家的就有四千万美元。目前，日本在拉丁美洲的私人直接投资占日本在海外整个私人直接投资的第一位。
    日本垄断资本在拉丁美洲扩张的主要对象是巴西。在巴西有二十三家企业是日本资本家出资建立的。目前还有几家大企业，在日本投资下进行建设。其中最重要的是米那斯炼钢厂。这个炼钢厂的总投资为五千五百万美元，日本资本为二千二百万美元，占40％。日本公司还以信贷形式提供全部设备。日本“小野田公司”、“旭日玻璃公司”，分别在巴西开办合资的水泥厂、玻璃厂。日本“东洋纺织公司”、“钟渊纺织公司”在巴西开办了自己的企业。日本“石川岛重工业公司”在巴西造船工业中投下了多达八百三十万美元的资本。此外，在巴西的四十万日本移民也在巴西工农业部门中积极活动，成为日本垄断资本渗入的强大支柱。
    在智利，日本三菱财阀的一批公司已经同智利谈妥建立开采铁矿的企业。日本的一家大汽车制造公司“日产”，决定为智利建设汽车厂提供“技术援助”。日本同秘鲁谈妥为秘鲁修建一座年产六万四千吨肥料的化肥厂提供“技术援助”。日本“开发海外矿物资源协会”于1958年底派一批地质工作者专门去勘查秘鲁的天然资源。
