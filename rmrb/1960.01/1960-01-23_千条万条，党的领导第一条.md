    Of all the lines, the Party's leadership is the first
    Tao Jian, First Secretary of the CPC Jiangshan County Committee, Zhejiang

    "With the Communist Party, happiness lasts for ten thousand years." This is the warm praise of the people of Jiangshan County for our Party. This is a true truth that the people of Jiangshan County have summarized from their own experiences since liberation, especially in the two years of the Great Leap Forward!

    1958 was an extraordinary year, and 1959 was also an extraordinary year. These two years have written an extremely glorious page in the history of Jiangshan County. Look, the total grain output in 1958 increased by 36.7% compared with 1957, and the total industrial output value increased by 58.17% compared with 1957; and the total grain output in 1959 increased by 36.3% compared with 1958, and the total industrial output value increased by 130% compared with 1958. One leap forward followed another, and one victory followed another. The people of Jiangshan County are advancing triumphantly on the road of socialist construction with giant strides. "Water has its source, and trees have their roots." Although there are thousands of reasons and thousands of experiences for the glorious victory of the people of Jiangshan County, the most fundamental one is the leadership of the Party. "Of all the lines, the Party's leadership is the first." This has become the firm belief of the working people of Jiangshan County.

    Once the general line formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao was put forward, it became a huge force inspiring people to build socialism at high speed, bringing about a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Under the glorious illumination of the general line of socialist construction, Jiangshan County rapidly changed from a grain-deficient county to a surplus-grain county. Industry went from nothing to something, from less to more, from small to large, developing from one small factory to fifteen factories. In Jiangshan County, which has always been called a "poor place," the face has changed greatly after two years. Most of the land in the Lianhu Production Team is backward paddy fields. The commune members said that this place is: "A sunny day is a drying ground for grain, a heavy rain floods it, trees don't grow when planted, and rice doesn't grow when sown," and the yield is very low every year. However, after this team implemented the Party's general line of socialist construction, the commune members broke superstitions, went all out, and strived for high yields. They turned the soil in the cold of winter and braved the snow, changing the appearance of 600 mu of barren land. Last year, the grain yield per mu reached 900 jin. Think about it, without the Party's general line and the people's soaring enthusiasm, how could such a miracle have occurred?

    Many facts in our county prove that wherever the Party's leadership is strengthened, political command is adhered to, the socialist orientation of the masses is clear, and the revolutionary enthusiasm is soaring, socialist construction can develop at high speed. Qinghu Commune is a good example. The Party committee of this commune organized cadres to study the spirit of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in depth at the end of August last year, further strengthened their confidence and determination to implement the general line, and carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution and continuous leap forward. As a result, the revolutionary enthusiasm was even higher, and a hot and vigorous atmosphere appeared in winter production. Repairing water conservancy in sunny days, and carrying out afforestation in rainy days. More than 3,000 mu of barren hills were afforested in five days, and 60% of the annual water conservancy task was completed in one month. Spring flower field management was grasped earlier and more carefully than in previous years. 80% of the spring flower fields have been cultivated twice. Just imagine, if we do not strengthen the Party's ideological leadership, do not adhere to political command, and do not overcome various right-leaning conservative ideas, how can we create such great achievements in such a short period of time?

    Now, a new year has begun. The conditions for realizing a continued great leap forward this year will be better than in 1958 and 1959. The most important thing is that, after the exercise of socialist and communist education movement, the combat effectiveness of party organizations at all levels has been further improved. It will more firmly guide the masses to fight a big battle for greater victory in 1960. In this new year, as long as we further strengthen the Party's leadership and hold high the red flag of the general line, 1960 will surely continue the great leap forward.

    千条万条，党的领导第一条
    中共浙江江山县委第一书记　陶健
    “有了共产党，幸福万年长”。这是江山县人民群众对于我们党的热烈的颂歌。这是解放以来，特别是大跃进两年来，江山县人民从自己亲身经历中总结出来的一条千真万确的真理！
    1958年是不平凡的一年，1959年也是不平凡的一年。这两年在我们江山县史册上写下了极其光辉灿烂的一页。看，1958年粮食总产量比1957年增长了36．7％，工业总产值比1957年增长了58．17％；而1959年的粮食总产量又比1958年增长了36．3％，工业总产值又比1958年增长130％。一个跃进跟着一个跃进，一个胜利接着一个胜利，江山县的人民正以巨人式的步伐，在社会主义建设的大路上高歌猛进。“水有源，树有根”，江山县人民取得这样辉煌的胜利，尽管有千百个原因，千百条经验，但是最最根本的一条是党的领导。“千条万条，党的领导第一条。”这已经成为江山县劳动人民坚定不移的信念。
    党中央和毛主席制定的总路线一经提出，就成为鼓舞人们高速度建设社会主义的巨大力量，带来了工农业生产的大跃进。江山县在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，由缺粮县迅速变为余粮县。工业从无到有，从少到多，从小到大，由原来一个小厂，发展到十五个工厂。在这个向来被人们称为“穷地方”的江山县，事隔两年，面貌大变。联湖生产队的土地大都是落后畈，社员们说这里是：“晴天晒谷场，一场大雨遭水淹，栽树树不长，种稻稻不发”，产量年年很低。但是从这个队贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线以后，社员们打破迷信，鼓足干劲，力争高产，在数九寒天冒雪翻土，使六百亩瘠田变了样，去年粮食亩产达到九百斤。想一想，如果没有党的总路线，没有人们的冲天干劲，怎能出现这样的奇迹？
    我们县的许多事实证明：哪里加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，哪里的群众社会主义方向明确，革命干劲冲天，哪里的社会主义建设就能够高速度地发展。清湖公社就是一个很好的例子。这个公社的党委在去年8月底组织干部深入学习了党的八届八中全会决议的精神，进一步坚定了贯彻执行总路线的信心和决心，发扬了不断革命、不断跃进的精神，因而革命干劲更加高涨，冬季生产出现了热气腾腾、生气勃勃的气象。晴天修水利，雨天搞绿化。五天绿化荒山三千多亩，一个月时间完成了全年水利任务的60％。春花田间管理比往年抓得更早、更细。有80％的春花田经过两次培育。试想，如果不加强党的思想领导，不坚持政治挂帅，不克服各种右倾保守思想，我们怎能在这样短的时间里，创造出这样伟大的成绩来呢？
    现在，新的一年开始了。今年实现继续大跃进的条件，将比1958年和1959年更好，最最主要的是：经过社会主义和共产主义教育运动的锻炼，各级党组织的战斗力更提高了。它将更加坚定地引导着人民群众为夺取1960年更大胜利而大战一场。在这新的一年里，只要我们进一步加强党的领导，更高地举起总路线的红旗，1960年就一定能继续大跃进。
