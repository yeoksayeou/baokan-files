    Climbing Higher Step by Step
    Chu Xue
    The goal of the technical revolution in China's construction enterprises is to gradually realize mechanized and factory-style construction. How can this goal be achieved? Attempting to "reach the sky in one step," hoping that all construction enterprises will immediately be equipped with sufficient modern machinery and implement factory-style construction, is unrealistic under the current economic conditions. The correct approach can only be a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, using foreign methods where possible, and indigenous methods where foreign methods are not possible, while vigorously launching mass-based technical innovation movements. This path is now generally understood.
    However, this path of integrating indigenous and foreign technological innovations is guided by the idea of continuous revolution. The so-called "using foreign methods where possible, and indigenous methods where foreign methods are not possible" means that in the absence of sufficient foreign equipment, we cannot wait. We must start from "indigenous" methods. It does not mean that once we use indigenous equipment – simple machines and tools – we can "stop here." When we say that we cannot attempt to "reach the sky in one step," we do not mean that we can be satisfied with backward manual operations, nor that we can "take our time" and "scratch the surface" in the technical innovation movement, contenting ourselves with some initial reforms. The technical innovation movement should progress from simple to complex, from low to high, and from indigenous to foreign, gradually improving. For example, the construction industry once launched a movement centered on "laying down the carrying pole," vigorously building simple machinery and improving tools. This was absolutely necessary. However, some units, after "laying down the carrying pole," achieving transportation by vehicles, and using improved tools, thought that they were almost there, or that the efficiency of the main processes had been improved with the reform of individual machines and tools. Obviously, holding this kind of thinking and sentiment makes it impossible to achieve the great goal of mechanized and factory-style construction, and impossible to continuously improve the labor productivity of the construction industry.
    Let's take a look at the comrades of the First and Second Municipal Engineering Offices of Harbin and the Jingdezhen Construction Engineering Company. How do they treat the technical innovation of the construction industry? The mixing station and back-end loading of the Second Engineering Team of the Second Municipal Engineering Office of Harbin have been mechanized, but they are not satisfied. They further integrated all processes into a production line; the Jingdezhen Construction Engineering Company has created and promoted many new tools, but they are also not satisfied, but further equipped advanced machines into sets, comprehensively improving work efficiency. The comrades of these units have a true spirit of continuous revolution, and also have a real ambition to move towards modernization.
    Of course, the technical innovation movement in various departments often has a certain stage. Each stage has its main focus, which means that in the long journey of "climbing higher step by step," each stage has an objective basis for which step to take. The current technical innovation movement in the construction industry has developed from sporadic, single-piece innovations in one process or one construction link to a new stage of systematic technical transformation based on trades and processes. The "one-dragon" movement of the Jingdezhen Construction Engineering Company and the organization of production lines in the First and Second Municipal Engineering Offices of Harbin are precisely the two main topics of this stage. Learning and promoting their work experience and spirit of continuous revolution by construction enterprises across the country will greatly advance the technical innovation movement of the national construction industry.

    步步登高
    楚雪
    我国建筑企业技术革命的目标是逐步实现机械化和工厂化施工。怎样实现这个目标呢？企图“一步登天”，希望所有建筑企业马上都装备充足的现代机械，实行工厂化施工，在目前的经济条件下是不现实的。正确的作法只能是土洋结合，能洋则洋，不能洋则土，大搞群众性的技术革新运动。这条道路现在一般人都看清楚了。
    但是，这条土洋结合的革新技术的道路，是以不断革命的思想为指导的。所谓“能洋则洋，不能洋则土”，是说在洋设备不足的情况下，不能等待，要从“土”起步，并不是说用上土设备——简易机具，就可以“到此止步”。我们说不能企图“一步登天”，既不是说可以满足于落后的手工操作，也不是说可以“慢慢来”，可以在技术革新运动中“浅尝辄止”，满足于一些初步的改革。技术革新运动应该由简到繁，由低到高，由土到洋，逐步提高。例如，建筑业曾经以“放下扁担”为中心，开展了大造简易机械和改良工具的运动。这是完全必要的。但是，有的单位在“放下扁担”，实现车子化，用上改良工具以后，就以为差不多了，或者以为有了单项机具的改革，主要工序的效率已经提高就行了。显然，持有这种思想情绪，就不可能实现机械化工厂化施工的伟大目标，就不可能不断地提高建筑业的劳动生产率。
    让我们看看哈尔滨市市政第一、第二工程处和景德镇市建筑工程公司的同志们吧。他们是怎样对待建筑业的技术革新呢？哈尔滨市市政第二工程处第二工程队的搅拌台和后台上料已经实现了机械化，但他们并不满足，他们进一步把全部工序组成了联动线；景德镇市建筑工程公司已经创造和推广了很多新工具，但他们也并不满足，而是进一步把先进机具配成套，全面提高了工作效率。这些单位的同志们有着真正的不断革命精神，也有着真正的奔向现代化的雄心大志。
    当然，各个部门的技术革新运动往往都有一定的阶段性。每一个阶段都有它的主攻方向，也就是在“步步登高”的长途中，每个阶段主要要迈出哪一步有它客观的根据。当前建筑业的技术革新运动，已经由零星的、单件的、一个工序、一个施工环节上的革新，发展到按工种、工序系统地进行技术改造的新阶段。景德镇市建筑工程公司的“一条龙”运动和哈尔滨市市政第一、第二工程处的组织生产联动线，正是这个阶段的两个主要的课题。各地建筑企业学习和推广他们的工作经验和不断革命的精神，将会使全国建筑业的技术革新运动向前大大推进一步。
