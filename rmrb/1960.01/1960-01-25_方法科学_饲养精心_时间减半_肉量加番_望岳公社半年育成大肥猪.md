    Scientific Methods, Careful Feeding, Halved Time, Doubled Meat
    Wangyue Commune Raises Big Fat Pigs to Maturity in Half a Year

    (Our Dispatch) The secretary of Wangyue Commune in Changsha County, Hunan Province, took the lead, cadres went down to the pig farms, and mobilized the masses to carry out scientific experiments on fattening pigs. They created an experience where the time from birth to fattening was halved, the meat yield was doubled, and the feed was relatively reduced. This is a good method for rapid fattening. At present, among the more than 50,000 pigs currently in stock in the entire commune, more than 5,600 have been raised into fat pigs weighing 140 to 150 jin within half a year of birth. The old almanac of "year pigs and month vegetables" (meaning vegetables can be eaten a month after planting, and pigs take a year to fatten) is no longer applicable. The rapid fattening method is now being widely promoted throughout the commune, striving to have more fat pigs on the market before the Spring Festival.

    Grouping, penning, dedicated feeding, and regular quantitative, phased fattening are major experiences in rapidly fattening pigs here. At present, the commune has 1,285 collective pig farms, which have established special fields and pens for large pigs, small pigs, sows, and feeder pigs, respectively, with separate pens and dedicated feeding. This makes it easy to allocate feed according to the different development and growth stages of the pigs, to feed them on time and in quantity, and to fatten them in stages. For example, the fattening experiment of six pigs jointly conducted by Zu Zhulin, the first secretary of the Party committee, and scientific researchers and feeders, divided the pigs into five stages: lactation, weaning, frame-up, early fattening, and rapid fattening, and fattened them in stages. Throughout the fattening process, green fodder was the main component, supplemented by refined feed, but the feed was allocated according to the different development and growth stages of the pigs. During the frame-up period, when the pigs weighed between 30 jin and 90 jin, they were generally fed more green fodder and less refined feed. During this period of about 100 days, the refined feed consumed by each pig generally accounted for only about 30% of the total refined feed required for the entire fattening process. Above 90 jin is the fattening period for pigs, and the amount of refined feed is gradually increased. During this period of 40 to 50 days, the refined feed consumed by each pig accounts for about 70% of the total refined feed required for the entire fattening. The result of using phased fattening and allocating feed according to the pigs is that less refined feed is used and the pigs grow faster. Their six pigs, calculated from January 3, 1959, to the 210th day in early August, weighed an average of 176 jin each, and gained an average of 0.83 jin of meat per day. During the entire fattening process, each pig ate 361 jin of refined feed and 2,640 jin of green feed, averaging 15 jin of green feed and 2 jin of refined feed to gain 1 jin of meat. Compared with fattening a pig in the past: the time was reduced by nearly half, the meat gain increased by more than double, and the feed was relatively reduced, especially the refined feed. In the past, pigs generally had to eat four or five jin of refined feed to gain one jin of meat; now, only about two jin of refined feed are needed to gain one jin of meat. This vividly illustrates that the speed of pig growth does not entirely depend on the amount of refined feed; scientific feeding management methods are a very important reason.

    Diversifying feed, rational matching, chopping finely, cooking thoroughly, and careful management are also major measures for rapid pig fattening. As the saying goes, "five-patterned _, six-combination soup, pigs love to eat it, and they grow quickly when exposed to the wind," indicating that pig feed needs to be diversified, and multiple nutrients need to be combined to make pigs grow quickly and well. Long Deliang, a feeder at the Changtangwan Pig Farm directly under the commune, fed 36 pigs weighing more than 80 jin. Initially, he only used _ as a type of green fodder. Although each pig ate one jin of refined feed every day, after feeding for more than a month, each pig only gained an average of more than four taels of meat per day. Later, he switched to using six or seven kinds of juicy green fodder such as amaranth, radish, and cowhide grass in combination, and chopped them finely and cooked them thoroughly. The amount of refined feed did not increase, but each pig gained more than one jin of meat per day, and the growth rate was more than twice as fast as before. In May last year, the Weixing Pig Farm in Tianding Brigade had 52 thin and weak pigs mixed with fat and strong pigs for feeding. Because the weak pigs could not get food, some lost weight, and each pig only gained an average of 0.19 jin of meat per day. Later, by adding extra meals and feed to the thin pigs and feeding them in special pens, the thin and weak pigs quickly grew fat, and within more than a month, each pig gained an average of 0.75 jin of meat per day, which was three times faster than before. The commune Party committee promptly summarized and promoted this experience, and established 63 special pens for thin and weak pigs throughout the commune, adding extra meals and feed to eliminate three types of pigs. According to the inspection at the end of November last year, of the more than 7,000 three-type pigs in the commune, more than 5,200 were raised to one type, and more than 1,800 were raised to two types, basically eliminating the three types of pigs.

    The experience of Wangyue Commune also proves that to raise pigs well, feeding and management must be given equal importance. Pigs must not only eat well but also sleep well. The pigsty must be kept clean regularly so that the pigs have a relatively comfortable living environment. The pigsties here are mostly facing south, sunny and ventilated, warm in winter and cool in summer. The manure can be discharged by gravity. The pig pens are cleaned two or three times a day, and disinfected with lime water once a week. Therefore, the pig mortality rate in the commune last year dropped from 2% in 1958 to 0.15%, basically becoming a commune without pig diseases. They also established more than 480 small pig playgrounds throughout the commune according to the living habits of "large pigs need to be confined, and small pigs need to roam." Small pigs are grazed on sunny days, and they are also washed and bathed. According to their experience, grazing small pigs and feeder pigs weighing forty or fifty jin has three major benefits: they get plenty of exercise, which can strengthen their legs and help them grow bones, which is beneficial to development and growth; the outdoor sunshine is good, and the air is fresh, which can enhance disease resistance and reduce disease; eating some wild grass and minerals in the soil in the wild can supplement the nutritional deficiencies of domestic feed and save some feed.

    Wangyue Commune has many methods for scientific fattening. For example, using cow blood injections to promote fattening, using fat pig powder and fat pig pills to promote fattening, and using traditional Chinese medicine _ and _ to promote fattening all have good results. Among them, the Soviet Union's advanced fattening experience—the method of fattening with cow blood injections—has even more significant effects. The more than 6,000 pigs in Wangyue Commune that were fattened with cow blood injections generally gained two or three taels more meat per day than pigs that were raised in the same way but not injected with cow blood.

    方法科学  饲养精心  时间减半  肉量加番
    望岳公社半年育成大肥猪
    本报讯　湖南长沙县望岳公社书记带头，干部下猪场，发动群众大搞猪只催肥的科学试验，创造了猪由初生到育肥，时间减半，肉量加番，饲料相对减少的经验，这是一种快速育肥的好办法。目前，在全社现有存栏猪五万多头中，已有五千六百多头在出生后半年内育成一百四、五十斤重的肥猪。过去所谓“年猪月菜”（意思是种菜一个月后有吃，猪要一年才能育肥）的老皇历已不适用了。现在全社已普遍推广快速育肥法，争取春节前有更多肥猪上市。
    分群、分栏、专人饲养，定期定量、分段育肥，是这里快速育肥猪的一条主要经验。目前，全社有集体养猪场一千二百八十五个，分别建立大猪、小猪、母猪、架子猪等专场专栏，分群分栏，专人饲养。这样便于按照猪的不同发育成长阶段，看猪配料，定时定量，分段育肥。例如，党委第一书记祖竹林和科学研究人员、饲养员共同负责的六头猪的育肥试验，就是将猪分成哺乳期、断奶期、吊架期、育肥初期和快速育肥期五个阶段，分段育肥；在整个育肥过程中，都以青料为主，精料为辅，但是要根据猪不同的发育成长阶段，看猪配料。猪在三十斤到九十斤的吊架子时期，一般喂青料多，精料少；在这一百来天的时间内，一般每头猪消耗的精料只占整个育肥过程所需精料总数的30％左右；九十斤以上是猪的育肥期，精料逐步增加，在这四、五十天的时间内，每头猪消耗的精料约占整个育肥所需要精料总数的70％左右。使用分段育肥、看猪配料的结果，是精料用的少，猪长得快。他们养的六头猪，从1959年元月3日出生算起，到8月初的二百一十天中，平均每头猪重一百七十六斤，平均每天长肉零点八三斤。在整个育肥过程中，每头猪吃精料三百六十一斤、青料二千六百四十斤，平均每头猪吃十五斤青料和两斤精料长一斤肉。这和过去育肥一头猪比较：时间减少将近一半，长肉增加一倍多，饲料也相对减少，特别是精料减少了。过去一般猪要吃四、五斤精料，才能长一斤肉；现在只要两斤左右的精料，就可以长一斤肉。这生动地说明了要猪长得快，并不完全取决于精料的多少，科学的饲养管理方法是很重要的原因。
    多种饲料，合理搭配，切细煮烂，精心管理，也是猪快速育肥的一条主要措施。俗话“五花?，六合汤，猪爱吃，见风长”，说明猪饲料需要多样化，多种营养搭配在一起，才能使猪长得快又好。公社直属的长塘湾养猪场饲养员龙德亮养三十六头八十多斤的猪，开始只用水绣花一种青饲料喂，虽然每头每天吃了一斤精料，但喂了一个多月，平均每头每天只长肉四两多；后来改用洋苋菜、萝卜、牛皮草等六、七种多汁青饲料配合喂，同时切得细，煮得烂，精料并未增加，可是每头猪每天长一斤多肉，增长速度比原来快一倍多。天顶大队卫星猪场在去年5月间有五十二头瘦弱猪和肥壮猪混在一起喂养，由于体弱吃不到食，有的退了膘，平均每头每天只长肉零点一九斤。后来，由于给瘦猪加餐加料，专栏喂养，瘦弱猪很快长肥，在一个多月内平均每头每天长肉零点七五斤，比原来增长速度快三倍。公社党委会及时总结和推广了这一经验，在全社建立了六十三个瘦弱猪专栏，加餐加料，消灭三类型猪。据去年11月底检查，全社七千多头三类型猪，有五千二百多头提高到一类型，有一千八百多头提高到二类型，基本上消灭了三类型猪。
    望岳公社的经验还证明：要养好猪，饲养与管理要并重，既要猪吃好，还要它睡好；猪舍要经常保持清洁，使猪有比较舒适的生活环境。这里的猪舍大都是坐北朝南，向阳通风，冬暖夏凉；粪便可以自流排出；猪栏每天打扫两、三次，每星期用石灰水消一次毒。因此去年全社猪死亡率已由1958年的2％下降到0．15％，基本上成为无猪病疫的公社。他们还根据“大猪要囚，小猪要游”的生活规律，全社建立了四百八十多个小猪运动场，小猪在晴天放牧，还给小猪洗刷沐浴。据他们的经验，小猪和四、五十斤的架子猪放牧有三大好处：得到充分的运动，能锻炼脚力，助长骨架，有利于发育成长；室外阳光好，空气新鲜，能增强抗病力，减少病疫；在野外吃一些野草和泥土里的矿物质，能补家饲料营养之不足，还能节省一部分饲料。
    望岳公社科学催肥的办法有很多种。比如，用牛血注射催肥，用肥猪粉、肥猪片催肥，用中药管仲、何首乌催肥，收效都很好。其中以苏联的先进催肥经验——牛血注射催肥办法，效果更为显著。望岳公社用牛血注射催肥的六千多头猪，一般比同样饲养而未注射牛血的猪，每头每天多长两、三两肉。　（胡坚）
