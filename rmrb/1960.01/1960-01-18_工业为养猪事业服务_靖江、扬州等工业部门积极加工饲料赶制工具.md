    Industry Serves Hog Raising
    Jingjiang, Yangzhou and Other Industrial Departments Actively Process Feed and Rush to Produce Tools
    (Our report) Industrial departments in Jingjiang, Taizhou, Yangzhou and other counties and cities in Jiangsu Province are actively supporting the hog raising industry.
    In order to greatly develop the hog raising industry, many factory workers in counties and communes are actively helping communes process mixed feed. Liyang County's grain processing factories universally use raw materials that can be found everywhere, such as rice straw, peanut shells, sweet potato vines, apricot silk grass, rice bran, and bran cakes, to make mixed feed. In the past month alone, more than 3.77 million jin have been produced. The quality of these feeds is very good. According to the experimental results of the staff of the Shezhu Grain Processing Factory using this mixed feed, each pig can grow an average of twelve taels of meat per day. The workers of the oil and rice processing plants in Taizhou County are using their brains and doing everything possible to help farmers expand the source of feed. In the past month, the variety of feeds processed by various factories has increased from five or six to more than a dozen. In the past, rice husks, buckwheat stalks, peanut vines, sweet potato vines, peanut shells, etc., which were rarely processed, are now being used in large quantities. The amount of feed produced by oil and rice factories throughout the county has increased by about 40% in the past month compared with the past. In order to produce more feed and meet the needs of large-scale pig raising, 27 factory leaders in Jingjiang County led more than 120 people to go deep into the countryside to develop feed sources and engage in large-scale feed processing. They have found more than 20 kinds of feed, such as straw crops, vines, leaves, fruit shells, thatch roots, and cotton bolls, totaling more than 6,000 tons.
    In order to meet the needs of the large-scale development of hog raising in rural areas and facilitate the masses, Liyang County, in addition to organizing 26 processing plants to fully carry out feed processing, has recently assisted various people's communes in establishing 19 feed processing plants, and plans to help communes establish 30 feed processing plants in the first quarter. The processing plants in Jingjiang County helped 22 people's communes in the county to set up temporary processing points and exchange points to obtain materials and process them locally. At the same time, they organized more than ten wooden boats and more than forty vehicles to deliver feed to the countryside and exchange it door-to-door.
    The broad masses of workers on the industrial front in Yangzhou City have tried every possible means to overcome various difficulties. In the first week of the new year, mechanical industry workers created more than 40 sets of mechanical equipment such as feed shredders and conveyors, and a large number of agricultural tools that combined foreign and local methods. In December 1959, the Taizhou County machinery department formulated a plan to support the mechanization and semi-mechanization of pig raising in the commune based on the development requirements of the county's pig raising industry, and assigned tasks to various factories. Before the end of last year, each machinery factory manufactured 200 feed pulverizers and grass cutters, and more than 1,000 transportation vehicles. Recently, all machinery factories in the county will produce a batch of large hammer mills, water pumps, washing machines and transportation vehicles to support the innovation of pig raising tools in large-scale pig farms in the commune. Under the leadership of the commune party committee, workers in the agricultural tool factories run by various communes are conducting in-depth innovation movements for pig raising tools. The cadres of many factories took the workers to live in the pig farms and reformed tools and installed equipment on the spot. The workers of the Jiangduo Commune Agricultural Tool Factory rushed to build a batch of feed pulverizers, carrot shredders, grass cutters, trolleys and iron and wood rails for the Mengwan 10,000-head pig farm of this commune, so that the pig farm basically realized the semi-mechanization of feed processing and the rail transportation of feeding carts. Water pipes are still being installed, and automatic water delivery will be realized in the short term. After these tools are used, work efficiency is generally increased tenfold compared to the past.
    In order to meet the needs of epidemic prevention and health medicines for pig farms in various places, Yangzhou Pharmaceutical Factory is actively testing and producing a variety of anti-vaccines and pig medicines. (Attached picture)

    工业为养猪事业服务
    靖江、扬州等工业部门积极加工饲料赶制工具
    本报讯　江苏省靖江、泰州、扬州等县、市工业部门积极支援养猪事业。
    为了养猪事业的大发展，许多县、社工厂的职工都积极地帮助公社加工混合饲料。溧阳县各粮食加工厂普遍采用稻草、花生壳、山芋藤、杏丝草、谷糠、糠饼粉等到处都可以找到的原料，制成混合饲料，近一月来已生产了三百七十多万斤。这些饲料质量很好，社渚粮食加工厂职工用这种混合饲料试验结果，每头猪平均每天可长肉十二两。泰州县各油米加工厂的职工，开动脑筋，千方百计地帮助农民扩大饲料来源。近一个月来，各厂加工的饲料品种已从五、六种增加到十多种，过去很少加工的稻瘪子、荞麦秆子、花生藤、山芋藤、花生壳等，现在都大量被利用起来。全县各油米厂生产的饲料数量，最近一个月来已比过去增加了40％左右。靖江县油米加工厂为了多产饲料，满足大量养猪的需要，有二十七家工厂的领导干部带领了一百二十多人深入农村，开辟饲料来源，大搞饲料加工，先后找到秸秆作物、藤叶、果壳、茅草根、棉铃等二十多种饲料，共六千多吨。
    为了满足农村养猪大发展的需要，便利群众，溧阳县除组织二十六个加工厂全面开展饲料加工外，最近还协助各人民公社建立了十九个饲料加工厂，计划在第一季度里还要帮助公社建立三十个饲料加工厂。靖江县各加工厂帮助全县二十二个人民公社设立了临时加工点，兑换点，就地取材、就地加工。同时还组织了十多只木船、四十多部车子，送料下乡，登门兑换。
    扬州市工业战线上的广大职工，千方百计克服各种困难，开年以来第一周，机械工业职工就创造了四十多台饲料切碎机、输送机等机械设备和大批洋土结合的农具。泰州县机械部门在1959年12月间就根据全县养猪事业发展的要求，制定了支援公社养猪实现机械化、半机械化的规划，并把任务落实到各个工厂。去年年底前，各机械厂就制造了饲料粉碎机、切草机各二百台，运输车辆一千多部。最近，全县各机械厂还要生产一批大型锤击机、水泵、洗涤机和运输车辆，支援公社大型养猪场革新养猪工具。各社办农具厂职工，都在公社党委的领导下，深入地开展养猪工具革新运动。许多厂的干部带着职工住在猪场里，就地改革工具，安装设备。蒋垛公社农具厂的职工，为这个社的孟湾万头养猪场赶造了一批饲料粉碎机、胡萝卜切碎机、切草机、小推车和铁木轨道，使这个养猪场基本实现了饲料加工半机械化，喂食车子轨道化，目前还在安装给水管，短期内就可以实现自动送水了。这些工具使用后，工效一般比过去提高十倍。
    为了满足各地养猪场防疫卫生药品的需要，扬州市制药厂正在积极试验和生产多种防疫苗和猪药。（附图片）
