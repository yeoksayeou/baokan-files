Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 27th. Last year, Shanghai industry, in its development towards high-end, large-scale, precision, and cutting-edge products, successfully trial-produced more than 20,000 new varieties and designs, of which more than 10,000 have already been put into production. This achievement has brought Shanghai's industrial technology to a new level, enabling this old industrial base to play a greater role in the overall Great Leap Forward of the national economy.

Among the new products successfully trial-produced in Shanghai last year, there were particularly many advanced and precision products, and they were present in all industries. Relevant departments believe that this is because the style of daring to think and daring to do, breaking superstitions, and liberating minds of the broad masses of workers in 1958 has been further developed last year. At the same time, during the Great Leap Forward in production and construction across the country last year, Shanghai was not only required to provide more old products than in the past, but also more advanced and precise new products. This was a huge force that promoted the trial production of new products in Shanghai's industrial sector. Taking several factories in Shanghai's electrical machinery industry that jointly produce complete sets of thermal power generation equipment as an example, the technical level of these factories is also rapidly increasing due to the unprecedented increase in electricity demand in various regions in recent years. After they successfully trial-produced the first 12,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator in 1956, they successfully trial-produced a 25,000-kilowatt unit in 1958, separated by two years; however, only one year later, they manufactured a 50,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator last year. Some of these large-scale power generation equipment have already been delivered, and some have already been installed and are generating electricity, and will play a huge role in the subsequent Great Leap Forward. The variety of steel and steel products produced by Shanghai's metallurgical industry also increased by dozens last year. Among them, ball bearing steel, high-speed steel, alloy structural steel, and alloy tool steel can all be produced in batches this year. The instrument and meter industry, the chemical industry, and the light industry also successfully trial-produced hundreds of advanced precision new products last year, such as electron microscopes, high-grade balances, rayon cord tires, optical glass, quartz glass, and acid-resistant enamel.

Numerous facts have repeatedly proven that vigorously launching mass movements and adopting the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods is a successful experience in Shanghai's new product trial production work last year. When the Shanghai No. 7 Machine Tool Factory accepted the task of trial-producing a batch of advanced precision universal milling machines last spring, there was not a single machine tool in the factory that could process these new products, and among the more than 600 workers, only a few could understand the blueprints of these new products. Under the leadership of the Party organization, the workers throughout the factory launched a mass upsurge of learning technology, learning technology while experimenting. In just over two months, most of the workers could understand the blueprints, and many first-level technicians quickly improved to the level of third and fourth-level technicians. On this basis, the workers used indigenous methods to create more than 40 simple equipment such as gantry planers and special five-axis boring machines, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient equipment. After half a year of hard work, they produced two highly precise universal milling machines. This year's practice has also fully demonstrated that by vigorously promoting communist collaboration, new products can be trial-produced more, faster, better, and more economically. Under the guidance of this thought, Shanghai last year had industrial departments connected with scientific research departments, higher education departments, art design departments, and commercial departments in a crisscross pattern, forming a very close large-scale collaboration network. When trial production of color films began last year, the trial production of color developers and sensitizers, the two main raw materials, was a key issue. The Shanghai Photosensitive Film Factory, which undertook the task of trial-producing this film, was a newly built factory and was unable to trial-produce these raw materials. After the East China Institute of Chemical Technology, the Shanghai Institute of Chemical Research, and many other dye factories and fragrance factories learned about this, they volunteered to share the task of trial-producing and producing these two basic raw materials. With the strong assistance of these units, color films were released ahead of schedule in just over half a year.

With the experience of the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, Shanghai's industrial departments have greater ambitions and greater enthusiasm for developing towards high-end, large-scale, precision, and cutting-edge products. Recently, various departments have been summarizing the experience in trial-producing new products last year, while studying and formulating plans for trial-producing new products this year. Many machinery and electrical machinery factories have taken various measures at the end of last year to make various preparations in advance, and began the work of trial-producing new products at the beginning of the year.

    土洋结合战无不胜　大搞协作连破关键
    上海制成大批高级精密新产品
    据新华社上海27日电　上海工业去年在向高级大型精密尖端方向发展中，试制成功了两万多种新品种和新花色的产品，其中已经投入生产的有一万多种。这一成就使上海工业技术达到了新的水平，使这个老工业基地在整个国民经济大跃进中发挥了更大的作用。
    上海去年试制成功的新产品中，高级、精密的产品特别多，而且行行业业都有。有关部门认为：这是因为1958年广大职工群众破除迷信、解放思想、敢想敢做的风格，去年又有了进一步的发扬。同时，去年全国各地在生产建设大跃进中，不仅要求上海提供比过去更多的老产品，而且要求更高级、更精密的新产品。这是一股巨大力量，促进了上海工业部门的新产品试制工作。以上海电机工业中的几家联合生产成套火力发电设备的工厂为例，由于各地近年来电力需要量空前增加，这些工厂的技术水平也在飞速提高。他们在1956年试制成功第一台一万二千瓩汽轮发电机后，在1958年试制成功二万五千瓩的机组，前后相隔两年；可是在这以后只隔一年时间，去年就制成了五万瓩的汽轮发电机。这些大型发电设备，有的已经交货，有的已经安装发电，都将在以后的大跃进中发挥巨大作用。上海冶金工业生产的钢和钢材的品种去年也增加了几十种。其中滚珠钢、锋钢、合金结构钢、合金工具钢等，今年都可以成批生产。仪器仪表工业、化学工业、轻工业，去年也试制成功了电子显微镜、高级天平、人造丝帘布轮胎、光学玻璃、石英玻璃、耐酸搪瓷等数以百计的高级精密新产品。
    许许多多的事实一再证明：大搞群众运动，采取土洋结合的办法，是上海去年试制新产品工作的一条成功经验。上海第七机床厂去年春天接受一批高级精密万能铣床的试制任务时，全厂没有一台机床可以加工这种新产品，而且在六百多个工人中，能看懂这些新产品图纸的也只有少数几个人。全厂工人在党组织的领导下，掀起群众性的学习技术的高潮，一边学技术，一边试验。只经过两个多月的时间，大多数工人都能看懂图纸，许多一级技工很快提高到三、四级技工的水平。在这个基础上，工人们采用土办法造出了龙门刨床、专用五轴镗床等四十多台简易设备，克服了设备不足的困难。半年奋战，就制成了两台精密度很高的万能铣床。这一年的实践还充分说明，大搞共产主义协作，新产品就试制得又多又快又好又省。上海去年在这种思想指导下，工业部门之间，以及工业部门同科学研究部门、高等教育部门、美术设计部门、商业部门之间，纵横交错，互相挂钩，构成了一个非常紧密的大协作网。去年开始试制五彩电影片时，成色剂和增感剂两种主要原料的试制是一个关键问题，承担这种影片试制任务的上海感光胶片厂是一个新建不久的工厂，无力试制这些原料。华东化工学院、上海化工研究院和其他许多染料厂、香料厂知道后，纷纷自告奋勇，分工承担了这两种基本原料的试制和生产任务。在这些单位的大力协助下，只经过半年多的时间，五彩电影片就提前出厂了。
    有了过去两年大跃进的经验，上海各工业部门向高级、大型、精密、尖端方向发展的雄心更大了，干劲更足了。最近，各部门都在一面总结去年试制新产品中的经验，一面研究和制订今年试制新产品的规划。许多机械、电机工厂在去年年底就采取各种措施，提前进行各项准备，年初就开始了试制新产品的工作。
