Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 2nd. Hu County, Shaanxi Province, has consistently adhered to spare-time cultural education for cadres for the past seven years. Since establishing spare-time cultural schools for cadres in 1953, the county has now formed a cadre spare-time cultural education network, initially establishing a spare-time education system from elementary school to middle school to university. A total of 1,257 cadres are participating in the study, accounting for over 94% of the number who should be enrolled. Over the past seven years, many cadres who were originally equivalent to junior primary school level have improved to senior primary school graduation level, those at senior primary school level have improved to junior middle school graduation level, and those at junior middle school level have improved to senior high school first or second grade level. A number of cadres have also entered Chinese language training courses or gone to university.

The unified leadership of the Party committee and persistent, unremitting efforts are the basic reasons for the remarkable achievements in cadre spare-time cultural education in Hu County. The CPC Hu County Committee frequently mobilizes leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in participating in study and promptly resolves ideological problems of students. The county committee also passed a resolution stipulating that cadre cultural study time cannot be arbitrarily occupied without the consent of the county committee. If it is necessary to occupy the time due to important tasks, it must be "borrowed" and "returned." Therefore, cadre cultural study throughout the county has never been interrupted, ensuring the timely completion of teaching tasks.

Hu County, based on the characteristics of cadres, resolutely implemented the educational policy of linking theory with practice, adapting to people, places, and times, and adopting various lively and vivid learning methods. Cadres have rich experience in struggle, high political consciousness, broad social knowledge, and strong comprehension abilities; however, they are generally older, their cultural levels are uneven, their work departments are different, their learning requirements vary, they are busy with work, have little time, live scattered, and have high mobility. In response to these characteristics, Hu County has established spare-time schools in urban areas where cadres are relatively concentrated, forming classes according to cadres' cultural levels, and using early morning and evening spare time for concentrated classes. Cadres in communes and management areas are scattered, and it is difficult to have daily classes, so learning stations are established in suitable locations, with designated study days for concentrated study once a week. Mountainous area cadres are even more scattered, across mountains and rivers, some hundreds of miles apart, so a combination of face-to-face instruction and correspondence courses is adopted for them. Based on the fact that cadres frequently go to the countryside and mountains, spare-time schools have also established a lesson receiving system, that is, before cadres go to the countryside, teachers determine the scope of study based on the length of time spent in the countryside, put forward study requirements, record problems encountered, and answer them after returning to school. If there is a central campaign and cadres go to the countryside in batches, the school temporarily establishes several learning points in the areas where cadres are concentrated, with teachers giving lectures on a rotating basis. For individual cadres who are not easily concentrated, self-study guidance outlines are sent. In order to effectively ensure that each student can complete their homework on time, spare-time schools have also established a make-up class system.

With the improvement of cadres' cultural level, their working ability and ideological level have also undergone significant changes. In 1958, 101 students of the county's cadre spare-time cultural school were rated as model workers in the organs. The Yuxia Grain Station in Yuxia Commune had twenty spare-time school students who, based on the principles of physics and mathematics, collectively created an electric grain selling machine, increasing the efficiency of grain selling from forty people per hour to more than four hundred people per hour. Wang Haobin, the deputy secretary of the Party committee of this commune, who could not understand newspapers in the past, is now a third-year junior high school student, and he frequently writes articles for newspapers.

### 鄠县建成干部业余教育体系  广大干部长期坚持学习　文化思想水平步步提高

     鄠县建成干部业余教育体系
    广大干部长期坚持学习　文化思想水平步步提高
    新华社西安2日电　陕西省鄠县七年来一贯地坚持干部业余文化教育。从1953年开始建立干部业余文化学校以来，到现在全县已形成了一个干部业余文化教育网，初步建立了从小学、中学到大学的业余教育体系。参加学习的干部共有一千二百五十七人，占应入学人数的94％以上。七年来，许多原来相当于初小程度的干部已提高到高小毕业水平，高小程度的提高到初中毕业水平，初中程度的提高到高中一、二年级水平。还有一批干部升入了语文专修科或者进入了大学。
    党委统一领导，长期坚持不懈，是鄠县干部业余文化教育获得显著成绩的基本原因。中共鄠县县委经常动员各级领导干部带头参加学习，及时解决学员的思想问题。县委并通过决议，规定干部文化学习时间不经过县委同意，不能任意占用，遇有重要任务不得不占用时，也要有“借”有“还”。因此，全县干部文化学习从来没有间断，保证了教学任务的按时完成。
    鄠县根据干部特点，坚决贯彻了联系实际的教育方针，因人、因地、因时制宜，采取了各种生动活泼的学习方式。干部的斗争经验丰富，政治觉悟高，社会知识广博，理解能力强；但是年龄一般较大，文化程度参差不齐，工作部门不同，学习要求不一，工作忙，时间少，居住分散，流动性很大。针对这些特点，鄠县便在干部比较集中的城镇地区设立业余学校，按照干部文化程度分别编班，利用早、晚业余时间集中上课。公社和管理区的干部分散，天天上课有困难，就在适中的地点设立学习站，规定学习日，每周集中学习一次。山区干部更加分散，隔山跨水，有的彼此相距百多里，对他们就采取了面授与函授相结合的办法。根据干部经常下乡上山的情况，业余学校还建立了领课制度，即在干部下乡前，教师根据下乡时间长短，确定学习范围，提出学习要求，碰到问题，记出笔记，回校后进行解答。如果碰到中心运动，干部成批下乡，学校就在干部集中地区临时设立若干学习点，由教师巡回讲课。个别不易集中的干部，寄发自学辅导提纲。为了切实保证每个学员都能按时学完功课，业余学校还制定了补课制度。
    随着干部文化水平的提高，干部的工作能力和思想水平也起了显著变化。1958年，全县有一百零一名干部业余文化学校的学员，被评为机关工作模范。余下公社余下镇粮站，有二十名业余学校的学员，根据物理、数学的原理，集体创造了一个电动售粮器，售粮效率由原来每小时四十人次提高到四百多人次。这个公社的党委副书记王浩斌，过去报纸也看不懂，现在是初中三年级生，他经常给报纸写稿。
