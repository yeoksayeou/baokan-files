    Raising Pigs – A Glorious Undertaking
    Comrade Shen Jinzhao, you led the masses, starting from scratch on the barren and poor mountains, and built a thousand-head pig farm in three years;
    Comrade Zhu Youying, it is your revolutionary dedication that supports you, racking your brains to innovate breeding methods and creating the miracle of "one pig producing a hundred piglets";
    People all praise you for raising pigs that are worth a calf, Comrade Yang Maoying;
    And Comrade Zheng Zongzan, for three years, you have been out in the wind and rain, curing more than seven thousand six hundred sick animals for the people.
    In you, and in thousands upon thousands of other breeding comrades, is embodied such a beautiful ideological style, overflowing with such lofty socialist construction enthusiasm! As the pig-raising industry develops rapidly today, and many places see one person per pig, one pig per mu of land, people cannot help but think of your hard work.
    Raising pigs is an infinitely glorious undertaking. This is primarily because it has a very important significance in socialist construction. More pigs mean more fertilizer and abundant grain harvests; this is the relationship between raising pigs and developing agricultural production. Every part of the pig is valuable; the meat can be eaten, and the skin, hair, bones, and internal organs are indispensable raw materials for many light industries. Raising one more pig is equivalent to adding a brick or tile to the construction project of the socialist edifice. This is a cause that benefits the people and is conducive to production development. When people connect their work with the construction of socialism, they will discover the truth and feel proud. Today, who would say that raising pigs is a "lowly" job that is inferior to others?!
    Raising pigs, like other work, is ordinary yet great, simple but also meticulous and scientific. In this job, one can not only make great contributions to socialism but also become both deeply specialized and ideologically advanced. Since 1957, Li Zhanying, a breeder in the Qianjin Commune of Wenshui County, has raised seven hundred pigs, all of them strong and fat. She has created a complete set of scientific methods in breeding management and is also a good doctor for pigs in epidemic prevention; Wu Min, an outstanding breeder from Liugezhuang Commune in Haiyang County, painstakingly studied the breeding laws of various animals and finally mastered a new breeding method, enabling each pig to produce an average of 22.5 piglets per year, an 88% increase in the farrowing rate compared to 1957. These comrades truly deserve the glorious title of "pig-raising experts" conferred by the masses! The age-old saying "Every profession produces its master" has only become a reality under the socialist system.
    The great cause of socialist construction is flourishing! The situation of the national pig-raising industry is also very good! Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and male and female commune members working in pig-raising positions, in order to make our country's pig-raising industry even greater, let us move forward more courageously!

### 养猪——光荣的事业

    养猪——光荣的事业
    沈进照同志，是你带领群众在荒凉贫瘠的穷山岗上，白手起家，三年之间建起了千头养猪场；
    祝有英同志，是革命的事业心支持你，挖空心思革新配种方法，创造了“一猪百仔”的奇迹；
    人们都夸奖你喂养的猪抵得上一头牛犊呵，杨茂英同志；
    还有郑宗赞同志，三年来，你风里来雨里去，为人民治好了七千六百多头病畜。
    在你们身上，千千万万的饲养员同志们，体现着多么美好的思想风格，洋溢着多么崇高的社会主义建设热情！当今天养猪事业迅速发展，许多地方出现一人一猪、一亩地一头猪的时候，人们不能不想到你们的辛勤劳动。
    养猪是一项无尚光荣的事业。这首先是因为，它在社会主义建设中，具有十分重要的意义。猪多肥足粮丰收，这是养猪和发展农业生产的关系；猪的全身都是宝，肉可食，皮、毛、骨、内脏是很多轻工业不可缺少的原料。多养一头猪，就等于给社会主义大厦的建设工程上添了一砖一瓦，这是有益人民、有利生产发展的事业。当人们把自己的工作和建设社会主义事业联系到一起的时候，他就会发现真理，感到自豪。在今天，又有谁说养猪是低人一等的“下贱”事呢？！
    养猪同其他工作一样，是平凡而伟大的工作，是简单但又细致科学的工作。在这个工作岗位上，既能够为社会主义做出伟大的贡献，同样可以红透专深。文水县前进公社饲养员李占英从1957年以来，喂养了七百头猪，头头身壮膘肥，她在饲养管理工作上，已经创造出一套完整的科学方法，在防疫工作上，也是猪的好医生；海阳县留格庄公社的出色配种员吴敏，苦心钻研各种动物的繁殖规律，终于掌握了新的配种法，使每头猪平均每年产仔二十二头半，比1957年产仔率提高88％。这些同志真不愧承当群众授予“养猪专家”的光荣称号！“三百六十行、行行出状元”这句千百年来的老话，只有在社会主义制度下，才变成了现实。
    伟大的社会主义建设事业，万象兴隆！全国养猪事业的形势也同样很好！在养猪岗位上工作的共产党员、共青团员、人民公社的男女社员们，为了使我国的养猪事业有一个更大的发展，更奋勇地前进吧！
