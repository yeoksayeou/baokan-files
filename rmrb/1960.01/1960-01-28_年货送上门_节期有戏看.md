New Year's Goods Delivered to Your Door, Performances to Watch During the Festival
	On the eve of the Spring Festival, I visited the Lishan People's Commune in Suixian County, Hubei Province. People are busy preparing to celebrate the Spring Festival. The salespeople at the central store are packaging pastries. The store manager told the reporter that to make things easier for the commune members, the New Year's goods were delivered to each team in advance, and cigarettes, firecrackers, and the like have already been sent. The commune's amateur cultural troupe is busy rehearsing programs for the Spring Festival performance. In the evenings, you can hear the sound of gongs, drums, and singing from afar. The busiest people are the commune's cadres at all levels. They held four or five meetings specifically to arrange the commune members' lives during the Spring Festival, in order to let them celebrate the festival happily, and they visited homes to solicit the commune members' opinions.
	A few days ago, at a mass meeting of the Xingqi Production Team, the production team leader gave the commune's festival plan—including festival living supplies and recreational activities—to the commune members for discussion. The commune members said, "The commune has arranged everything so thoughtfully, what is there to discuss? Let's talk about production before and after the festival." Deng Yixin, a commune member in his sixties, said excitedly: Before the Spring Festival even arrives, the commune and production team have already arranged everything for us. They have not only prepared fish, honey, pastries, and other foods for us, but even firecrackers and red paper for writing couplets have been prepared. Many commune members proposed that within three days after the festival, the team's existing more than 160 mu of rice threshing grounds and winter fallow land should be fully reclaimed for planting vegetables.
	In the days before the Spring Festival, the hillsides and riverbanks are full of people planting trees. The barren ridge of "Jiulidui," which is several miles long, has been planted with apples, peaches, and plums; rows of neat cypress trees have also been newly planted along the highways and major roads. The commune members said that they want to decorate their land with new clothes to welcome the Spring Festival. When spring returns to the earth and these trees sprout and bud, the beautiful fields here will add a lot of splendor.

    年货送上门　节期有戏看
    在春节前夕，记者来到湖北省随县厉山人民公社。人们正为准备欢度春节而忙碌着。中心商店的营业员们正在包装糕点，商店经理告诉记者，为了方便社员，今年把年货提前送给各小队，香烟、鞭炮等早已送去了。公社业余文工团在忙着排练春节演出的节目，一到晚间，远远地就能听到锣鼓和歌唱声。最忙的要算公社的各级干部了，他们为了让社员们欢欢喜喜过春节，曾开过四、五次会，专门安排春节期间的社员生活；并且登门访问，征求社员们的意见。
    几天前，在星旗生产队的一个群众大会上，生产队长把今年的过节计划——包括节日生活供应和文娱活动等，交给社员们讨论。社员们说：“公社安排得这样周到，还有什么讨论的，还是把节前节后的生产说说吧。”六十多岁的社员邓义新兴奋地说：春节还没到，公社、生产队就早给我们把什么都安排好了，不但给我们准备了鱼、蜂蜜、糕点等吃的，连鞭炮和写对联的红纸都给准备了。许多社员提出，要在节后三天内，把全队现有的一百六十多亩稻场地和冬闲地，全部开垦出来种菜。
    在春节前的几天，山坡上、河滩边，到处都是植树的人群。几里长的“九里堆”荒岗上，已经遍植苹果、桃、李；公路、大路两旁也新种了一列整齐的柏树。社员们说，要给他们的土地修饰新装迎接春节。等到春回大地，这些树木发芽吐蕾的时候，这里的锦绣田野，又将增加不少丰采。
