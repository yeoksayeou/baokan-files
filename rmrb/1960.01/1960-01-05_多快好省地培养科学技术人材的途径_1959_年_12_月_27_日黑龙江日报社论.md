    Ways to Cultivate Scientific and Technological Talent Quickly, Effectively and Economically
    December 27, 1959, Heilongjiang Daily Editorial
    In order to adapt to the needs of the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, especially to adapt to the agricultural technology transformation in our province and the realization of production mechanization and automation on the industrial front, it is necessary to further cultivate a large number of scientifically and technologically talented people with socialist consciousness. In recent years, with the great development of education and science, our province already has a considerable scientific and technological force, but whether in terms of quantity or quality, it is far from meeting the requirements of the development of the objective situation, both from the current needs and from the long-term needs. Therefore, taking active measures to accelerate the cultivation of a large number of scientific and technological talents in a planned and effective manner is the key to whether or not we can develop socialist construction at a high speed.
    In cultivating scientific and technological talents, it is necessary to adopt formal methods, that is, to gradually study and master science and technology in schools and scientific research institutions. In this regard, we have not only done a great deal of work in the past, but also will continue to vigorously run schools of all levels and types in the future, establish a large number of specialized scientific research institutions of various kinds, and manage them well. Cultivating scientific and technological talents takes a certain amount of time, but the needs of the development of the situation require us to shorten the time as much as possible. Therefore, in addition to formal methods, we should also consider adopting rapid methods for cultivating talents, that is, breaking with conventions in the system and mobilizing all factories, enterprises, educational departments, and scientific research institutions with the conditions to cultivate scientific and technological talents. Only when everyone does this can we speed up the cultivation of construction talents and adapt to the needs of the rapid development of socialist construction.
    Many factories and enterprises in Harbin, with production as the main focus and education and scientific research as auxiliary, implement the method of "one main, two auxiliary, and three combinations," which not only solves many major and key problems in production and promotes the development of production, but also improves the cultural, scientific and technological level of the vast number of workers and staff, and cultivates a large number of scientific and technological talents for the country. From this, we can also get such enlightenment, that is, the method of "one main, two auxiliary, and three combinations" is not only applicable to production units, but also equally applicable to schools and scientific research institutions. Factories and farms can be set up in schools, and universities and colleges can also conduct scientific research. In fact, many schools do this, and have also achieved great success. Therefore, if all our production departments, schools, and scientific research institutions become bases for the combination of productive labor, learning, and scientific research, then we can cultivate a large number of scientific and technological talents needed in a short period of time, and production, education, and scientific research work will show a continued great leap forward.
    Facts have proved that the method of "one main, two auxiliary, and three combinations" is an effective way to cultivate scientific and technological talents quickly, effectively, and economically. Party organizations at all levels, party organizations of all production departments, schools, and scientific research institutions should give it sufficient attention, and combine it with specific circumstances to plan and take measures to establish a large number of bases for the combination of productive labor, learning, and scientific research, and make greater contributions to the cultivation of scientific and technological talents for the country.

    多快好省地培养科学技术人材的途径
    1959年12月27日黑龙江日报社论
    为了适应工农业生产继续跃进的需要，特别是适应我省农业技术改造和在工业战线上实现生产机械化、自动化的需要，必须进一步培养大量的有社会主义觉悟的科学技术人材。几年来，随着教育和科学事业的大发展，我省虽然已经具有一支相当可观的科学技术队伍，但是无论在数量上或者质量上，从目前需要或者从长远的需要看，都还远远不能满足客观形势发展的要求。因此，采取积极措施，有计划而又有成效地加速培养大量的科学技术人材，乃是能否高速度地发展社会主义建设事业的关键所在。
    在培养科学技术人材中，采取正规的办法是必要的，这就是在学校中和科学研究机关中循序渐进地钻研与掌握科学技术。在这方面，我们不仅过去进行了巨大的工作，而且在今后仍然要大力兴办各级各类学校，大量建立各种各样的专门的科学研究机构，并把它们办好。培养科学技术人材需要一定的时间，但是由于形势发展的需要又要尽量地把时间加以缩短，因此就应当考虑除了正规的办法之外，还采取速成的培养人材的办法，这就是在制度上打破成规，发动一切有条件的工厂企业、教育部门和科学研究机关都来培养科学技术人材，只有大家都来这样做，才能加快培养建设人材的速度，适应社会主义建设迅速发展的需要。
    哈尔滨市许多工厂、企业，以生产为主，以教育、科学研究为辅，实行一主二辅三结合的办法，不仅解决了许多生产上的重大关键问题，促进了生产的发展，也提高了广大职工的文化科学技术水平，为国家培养了大批科学技术人材。从这里，我们还可以得到这样的启发，那就是“一主二辅三结合”的办法，不仅适用于生产单位，也同样适用于学校和科学研究机关。在学校中可以办工厂农场，高等学校并可进行科学研究。实际上许多学校也是这样做的，而且同样取得了很大的成就。因此，如果我们的一切生产部门、学校和科学研究机关都成为生产劳动、学习和科学研究三结合的基地，那么我们就可以在短期内大量培养出所需要的科学技术人材，生产、教育和科学研究工作将会出现一个继续大跃进的局面。
    事实证明，“一主二辅三结合”的办法，乃是多快好省地培养科学技术人材的有效途径。各级党组织，一切生产部门，学校和科学研究机关的党组织，都应对它给予足够的重视，并结合具体情况进行规划，采取措施大量地建立起生产劳动、学习、科学研究三结合的基地，在为国家培养科学技术人材方面作出更大的贡献。
