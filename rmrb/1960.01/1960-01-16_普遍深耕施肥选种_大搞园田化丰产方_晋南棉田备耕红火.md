Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 14th: The Jinan Prefecture in Shanxi Province, a cotton-producing area, is stepping up its preparations for cotton field sowing. A cotton field preparation movement with deep plowing, fertilization, watering, seed selection, pest control, and vigorous development of garden-style, high-yield plots has been launched throughout the region.

Statistics at the end of last year showed that out of the 3.3 million mu of cotton fields in the entire prefecture, nearly 40% of the cotton field area has been plowed twice to a depth of eight inches or more on the basis of universal deep plowing; base fertilizer has been applied to all fields in conjunction with deep plowing, with an average of 50 to 70 dan applied per mu; more than 200,000 mu of cotton fields have been watered in winter; all of the more than 80 million jin of cotton seeds needed in the region have been prepared and more than half have been selected by grain. Activities such as spraying pesticides in cotton warehouses, processing straw, and burning alfalfa stubble have also been fully launched.

Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership in the preparation of cotton field sowing. Wang Zhiguo, Secretary of the Lin Yi County Party Committee, personally worked with commune members to break down district boundaries in the Chengguan Commune and created a 10,000-mu high-standard, garden-style, high-yield plot. The cotton fields in the high-yield plot were leveled like mirrors, the soil was finely crushed, the canals were like nets, the ridges were straight as lines, the deep plowing was eight inches deep, and the base fertilizer was 10,000 dan. A 10,000-head pig farm was also built in the middle. After the County Party Committee organized cadres above the level of team leader throughout the county to visit, a climax of continuous square construction has been set off throughout the county. In Yuncheng County, a high-yield cotton base in the region, cotton production headquarters have been established at all levels to both deeply plow and fertilize, build continuous squares, and train technical personnel.

    普遍深耕施肥选种　大搞园田化丰产方
    晋南棉田备耕红火
    据新华社太原14日电　山西省棉花产区晋南专区加紧进行棉田播种准备工作。一个以深耕、施肥、浇水、选种、治虫和大搞园田化、丰产方为内容的棉田备耕运动，已经在全区各地展开。
    截至去年底的统计：全专区三百三十万亩棉田，在普遍深耕的基础上，二次深耕八寸以上的棉田面积已接近40％；结合深耕全部施入底肥，每亩平均施五十担到七十担；棉田已冬浇了二十万亩以上；全区所需的八千多万斤棉籽，已全部备好，并已粒选过半。花库喷药，秸秆处理，火攻苜蓿茬等活动，也都全面展开。
    各级党委都加强了对棉田播种准备工作的领导。中共临猗县委书记王治国亲自和社员一起，在城关公社打破区界，搞了一个万亩高标准园田化丰产方。丰产方里的棉田做到了地平如镜，土壤细碎，渠道如网，埂直如线，深耕八寸，底肥一万。中间还建成一个万头猪场。县委组织全县队长以上干部参观后，全县已掀起了一个连片建方高潮。全区棉花高产基地的运城县，层层都成立棉花生产指挥部，一面深耕施肥，连片建方，一面训练技术力量。
