    "Coast to Coast"
    By Our Correspondent Li Yichuan

    The "Coast to Coast" march held by British youth against nuclear weapons and American military bases has come to a victorious end. The marchers started from Liverpool on the west coast, crossed the Pennine mountain range, passed through more than a dozen famous cities such as Lancashire, lasted nine days, covered a distance of one hundred and thirty-two miles, and finally reached their destination, Hull. This is a rare large-scale peaceful demonstration of such a long distance in Britain.
    "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire"
    The participants in this march had all kinds of political affiliations, from Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members to ordinary Labour Party members; there were Christians and Catholics. They were united on the point of demanding the abolition of atomic weapons and opposing the establishment of missile bases by the United States in Britain. The same bond united them closely and completed a march of great significance. In terms of age, the basic team participating in the march averaged only twenty years old, some were only fifteen or sixteen years old, but the vast majority were young people between sixteen or seventeen and twenty years old.
    The British government's policy of atomic deterrence, arming West Germany with atomic weapons, and allowing the United States to establish missile bases in Britain have all aroused particular dissatisfaction among the British people. Young people are more sensitive to these issues, which has made the scale of this march develop very rapidly. The movement started like this: One day, several young people in Sheffield were talking in a bar, and they generally felt strongly dissatisfied with the atomic policy and American military bases, so they decided to use a "Coast to Coast" march to express their protest. Initially, only five people participated. But such news spread quickly throughout Britain. Many young people came upon hearing the news. When they gathered in Liverpool to start the march, there were already more than forty people from all over the country. Later, the number of marchers continued to increase, like a snowball, getting bigger and bigger. It was not limited to young people, adults also enthusiastically participated. When they finally arrived in Hull, a peaceful army of more than two hundred people had formed.
    Ban Nuclear Weapons
    The participants in the march were all energetic and full of confidence. In order to prepare for the long trek, they carried luggage bags, wore canvas clothes and marching shoes, and wore felt hats. Many people had "Nuclear Disarmament" armbands sewn on their clothes. They looked so heroic, cheerful and optimistic, and their eyes radiated confidence in their cause. They raised the banners of "Fight for Survival, Against Nuclear Weapons" and "Ban the (Nuclear) Bomb" and set off from Liverpool in a mighty manner.
    When they arrived in St. Helens the next day, although it was raining heavily, the marchers still held high the banner against the atomic bomb and shouted the slogan "Ban, ban, the hateful hydrogen bomb" and held a demonstration in the city.
    That was still easy, there was a more difficult road ahead. They had to pass through the Pennine mountain range, where the roads are rugged and the weather is uncertain. A few years ago, a major storm in Britain swept away vehicles passing through here. They arrived here on the fourth day. When they set off that day, the earth was covered with bright sunshine, but before they had reached the suburbs, the sky was already covered with dark clouds. It rained non-stop along the way, and the marchers' clothes were soaked. Coupled with the cold wind on the plateau, it was difficult to move. But this did not frustrate the marchers' fighting spirit, and they continued to advance towards their destination. Along the way, there were not only difficulties brought about by natural conditions, but also obstacles from the British government. In Lancashire, plainclothes police inquired about the origins and identities of the marchers in the march; in Leeds, the police refused to allow them to enter the city before 6 pm, on the grounds that it "obstructed traffic." The British people warmly welcomed and meticulously cared for the marchers. Wherever the march went, people waved to them, sometimes giving a thumbs up to show their respect. A man in the march named John Woolley told me that they saw many women moved to tears by their actions. The starkest contrast was: in Halifax, the Home Office refused to lend blankets to the marching team for the night; after the local people heard this news, they brought their blankets and bedding, and even cots, for the marchers' use within a few hours.
    "Eisenhower – Hypocrisy"
    In the last few days of the march, when they heard the news that the United States was going to resume nuclear weapons testing, they felt very indignant. "Eisenhower – Hypocrisy" This is a straightforward comment from Frances Beaumont, a sixteen-year-old girl from Kent. She said firmly: "Eisenhower talks about peace in his mouth, but actually engages in war, otherwise why would he resume nuclear weapons testing!" Her view quickly resonated with others.
    The British government's mass arrest of peaceful marchers was also criticized by them. Alistair Barger said with contempt: "Prisons can't hold everyone!" Andrew Burchard, who was standing aside, immediately added: "This is a desperate act, it can only make more people rise up against it!"
    Arrived at the Destination
    After eight days of marching, many people had blisters all over their feet. Walking dozens of miles every day was quite tiring, but no one dropped out along the way. On the ninth day, they entered Hull – the destination.
    Why did the marchers choose Hull as their destination? During World War II, Nazi German planes bombed the city to the ground, and more than 90% of the buildings were destroyed. Even now, the city still has many ruins, broken walls and rubble left over from the war. Many people still live in small houses built temporarily after the war. But now, the forces of war are arming West Germany with even more ferocious weapons. The marching team, led by a band, entered the city of Hull playing songs against nuclear weapons. The marchers held high torches, illuminating the way forward. The residents of Hull gave the marchers a warm welcome.
    In this way, the peace-loving young people of Britain protested against the authorities' policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, and sowed more seeds of peace.

### “从海岸到海岸”

    “从海岸到海岸”
    本报记者　李一川
    英国青年举行的反对核子武器、反对美国军事基地的“从海岸到海岸”的大游行，已经胜利地结束了。游行者是从西海岸的利物浦开始，横跨奔宁山峰，穿越兰开夏等十几个著名城市，历时九天，行程一百三十二英里，最后到达目的地赫尔。这是英国少有的一次这样长距离、大规模的和平示威。
    “星火燎原”
    参加这次游行的人有各种各样的政治面貌，从共产党员、共青团员到普通的工党党员；有基督教徒，也有天主教徒。他们在要求废除原子武器、反对美国在英国设立导弹基地这一点上却是一致的。同一根纽带使他们紧密地团结起来，完成了一次有重大意义的游行。从年龄上来说，参加游行的基本队伍平均不过二十岁，有的只十五、六岁，但绝大部分是十六、七岁到二十岁的青年。
    英国政府执行的原子威慑政策、以原子武器武装西德和允许美国在英国设立导弹基地的政策都引起了英国人民的特别不满。青年对这些问题感觉更为敏锐，这也就使得这次游行的规模发展得非常迅速了。运动开始时，是这样的：有一天，设菲尔德几位青年在酒吧间谈心，他们普遍对原子政策和美国军事基地感到强烈的不满，于是下决心要用“从海岸到海岸”的游行来表示抗议。最初只有五人参加。但这样一个消息迅速地在全英国传开了。好些青年闻风而至。他们从利物浦集合开始游行时，已经有从全国各地来的四十余人了。以后游行人数不断增加，像滚雪球一样，愈滚愈大。也不仅限于青年了，成年人也踊跃参加了。最后到达赫尔时，已形成二百多人的一支和平大军。
    禁止核武器
    参加游行的人，个个都是生龙活虎、信心百倍。为了准备长途跋涉，他们背着行李袋，穿着帆布衣服和行军鞋，戴着毡帽，许多人衣服上都缝有“核子裁军”的臂章，看起来，他们是那样的豪迈、开朗和乐观，他们眼睛中放射出对他们事业充满信心的光芒。他们举起了“争取生存，反对核武器”、“禁止（核）炸弹”的旗帜，浩浩荡荡从利物浦出发了。
    第二天到达圣海伦斯时，虽然天下着倾盆大雨，但是游行者仍高举着反对原子弹的大旗，喊着“禁止，禁止，可恶的氢弹”的口号，在市内举行了示威。
    这还算容易的，前面还有更难走的路哩。他们必须通过奔宁山峰，这儿道路崎岖，风雨无定。几年前英国的一次大风暴将从这里过往的车辆刮走了。他们是第四天到达这儿的。那天他们出发的时候，大地上撒满着灿烂的阳光，但等他们还没走到郊区时，却已是满天乌云了。一路上，雨下个不停，游行者的衣服都被淋透了。再加上塞上寒风，行动很困难。但这并不能挫折游行者的斗志，他们一直向目的地勇往前进。沿途上，不止是自然条件所带来的困难，而且还有来自英国政府的各方阻挠。在兰开夏，便衣警察在游行队伍中打听游行者的来历和身份；在里子，警察拒绝他们在晚间六时前进入市内，理由是“妨碍交通”。英国人民对游行者却是热烈欢迎和无微不至的照顾，无论游行队伍走到什么地方，总有人向他们招手，有时竖起大拇指，表示对他们的敬意。游行队伍中有个叫约翰屋利的，他告诉我：他们看见许多妇女被他们的行动感动得流泪。最鲜明的一个对照是：在哈利法克斯，内政部拒绝把毛毯借给游行队伍过夜用；当地群众听到这一个消息后，在几小时内，就把他们的毛毯和被褥、甚至行军床拿来供游行者用。
    “艾森豪威尔——伪善”
    在游行的最后几天，当他们听到美国要恢复核武器试验的消息后，感到非常愤慨。“艾森豪威尔——伪善”这是从肯特来的十六岁姑娘佛朗西斯·波蒙特的一句直截了当的评语。她斩钉截铁地说：“艾森豪威尔是嘴里讲和平，实际上搞战争，要不然为什么还要恢复核武器试验呢！”她的这种看法很快地引起了其他的人的共鸣。
    英国政府大量逮捕和平游行者也遭到他们的纷纷抨击。阿利斯·巴格勒鄙视地说：“监狱，关不了所有的人！”站在一旁的安德鲁·巴查德马上接着说：“这是一个绝望的行动，它只能使更多的人起来反对它！”
    到达了目的地
    经过八天的行军，许多人磨的满脚都是泡了，每天走几十英里，是相当疲劳的，一路上却没有一个人掉队。第九天，他们进入了赫尔——目的地。
    游行者为什么选择赫尔作为他们的目的地呢？在第二次世界大战时，纳粹德国的飞机曾把这个城市炸成了平地，90％以上的建筑物都被炸毁了，直到如今这个城市还有战争留下的许多残垣、断壁和废墟。许多人还住在战后临时盖的小房子中。可是现在，战争势力又在用更凶恶的武器武装西德。游行队伍在一个乐队带领下，奏着反对核武器的歌曲进入赫尔城。游行者高举着熊熊火炬，照耀着前进的道路。赫尔城的居民们给了游行者以热烈的欢迎。
    英国的热爱和平的青年们，就这样向当局的扩军备战的政策提出了抗议，而且撒播下更多的和平种子。
