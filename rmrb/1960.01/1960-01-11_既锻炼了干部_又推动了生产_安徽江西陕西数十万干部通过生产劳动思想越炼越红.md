Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 10th. In 1959, a total of 301,000 cadres from organizations, factories, mines, schools, and people's organizations above the county level in Anhui Province participated in labor training, contributing a total of 14,531,000 workdays, with an average of nearly 45 days of labor per person.

Through labor training, cadres in various regions strengthened their class viewpoint, labor viewpoint, and mass viewpoint, and improved their work style. Many young intellectual cadres personally experienced the noble qualities of the working people during labor, recognizing that labor is glorious, the masses are great, and establishing deep feelings with the masses. Wang Dongchu, a cadre from the Feidong County Civil Affairs Section, was sent to the Bailing Brigade of Gaoliang Commune. He lived in the home of a commune member surnamed Zhao and often used his rest time to help fetch water, sweep the yard, and do other housework. The old landlady regarded him as her own son and trusted him very much, entrusting him with the safekeeping of her keys when she went out. Lu Benhou, a cadre from the Rural Work Department of the CPC Huoshan County Committee, sprained his back while carrying a load during labor training in the Fozi Ridge Commune. Chen, an old lady in her sixties, went to great lengths to search for "Zhui Hongteng" medicinal herbs all over the mountains to cure his back injury.

After leading cadres participated in physical labor, they promptly understood the situation in their work, summarized their experiences, and provided more concrete guidance. Song Yuxiu, First Secretary of the CPC Lezhi County Committee, helped grassroots cadres clarify accounts and solve distribution problems while working as a commune member in the Laowu Production Team of Qingshan Commune, which mobilized the production enthusiasm of the commune members and promoted the development of production. Zhan Xianyu, First Secretary of the CPC Lujiang County Committee, helped rectify the public canteen and establish and improve management systems while working as a commune member in the Machang Commune, making a variety of meals and improving the lives of the commune members. The commune members praised: "The secretary personally goes to the canteen, making coarse grains refined and diverse. Eating the food made by the secretary gives us strength to work hard. Eating the dishes made by the secretary, production leaps forward and a hundred flowers bloom."

Cadres also learned a lot of production knowledge through labor training. Cadres sent to the countryside for labor training generally learned basic farm work such as carrying loads, operating waterwheels, plowing fields, sowing seeds, weeding, and harvesting. Cadres sent to factories and mines also learned certain production knowledge and operating techniques. Many cadres, together with the masses, actively studied technology, created and imitated advanced tools, and improved labor productivity.

Cadre participation in labor also directly created a large amount of material wealth for the country. According to statistics from provincial-level organizations alone, they cultivated 3,300 mu of land, harvested more than 460,000 jin of various grains, more than 44,300 jin of oil crops, more than 3 million jin of vegetables, and raised more than 25,800 pigs and more than 2.67 million fish.

When organizing cadres to participate in physical labor, leading organs at all levels in Anhui Province paid special attention to centering around the production and work center of each period, closely combining cadre training with the promotion of production. During the spring rectification of the people's communes last year, the province transferred more than 55,900 cadres to the countryside to work and participate in physical labor. During the summer's rush to harvest early rice, rush to plant late rice, and fight drought, the province organized more than 100,000 cadres to go to the countryside to participate in labor for two or three months. This both trained cadres and promoted production and work.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 10th. In the past year, more than 105,000 cadres from leading organs above the county level in Jiangxi Province have been sent to people's communes and factories and mines to participate in labor training, with a total of more than 2,920,000 days of labor. Among them, there were more than 5,100 leading cadres above the county level, accounting for 64.15% of the total number of leading cadres above the county level in the province, including members of the CPC Jiangxi Provincial Committee, directors and bureau chiefs of provincial-level organs, secretaries of district committees, commissioners, and secretaries and heads of county committees.

After cadres at all levels were sent to the grassroots to participate in labor training, they were able to examine the implementation of the party's policies at the grassroots level with their own experience, thereby continuously improving their work style and further strengthening the ties between the party and the masses. Wang Jingmin, First Secretary of the CPC Fuzhou District Committee, participated in labor in the Chunguang Brigade of the Hunan People's Commune in Linchuan County during early rice transplanting last year. He found that some rice fields were planted too densely, while others were planted too sparsely, so he studied with the masses and proposed a reasonable opinion on dense planting, which was generally satisfactory to the masses. Because other places also had the same problem, Wang Jingmin suggested that the county party committee hold an on-site meeting to summarize and promote the experience of the Chunguang Brigade. This working method made the work more practical and effective. Xiao Zhaohuan, Deputy Director of the Finance and Trade Department of the CPC Nanchang County Committee, participated in labor in the Wenfang Brigade of the Fushan Commune. He saw that the Hushan Team lacked fertilizer, so he worked with the team cadres to mobilize the masses to make more than 30 field cellars, accumulating more than 1,900 dan of fertilizer. The masses praised him, saying: "Down-to-earth cadres are vanguards, wherever they go, things turn red. They can break through thousands of difficulties, and backwardness will also become advanced."

Cadre participation in physical labor has played a great role in strengthening labor viewpoints, enhancing the feelings of the working people, and strengthening physical fitness. Liu Yaozhi, a cadre of the Jiangxi Provincial Metallurgical Design Institute, was not at ease with his work in the past. Last year, after he was sent to a mine to participate in labor, he was deeply moved by seeing the old workers' fearless and heroic labor. He truly realized that the working class is the greatest class, and only by earnestly learning from the workers can he transform himself well. Now, not only is he at ease with his work, but he has also been rated as an advanced worker, and the group he works in has also been rated as a Youth Red Flag Group.

This newspaper reports that cadres at all levels in Shaanxi Province have universally participated in physical labor training in the past year and have achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics, cadres throughout the province have participated in physical labor for more than 6 million workdays.

Last year, there were a total of 9,200 cadres who were transferred from organs to rural factories for longer-term labor training; there were a total of 2,500 provincial party secretaries, governors, provincial department and bureau chiefs, district party secretaries, commissioners, county party secretaries, county heads, and leading cadres equivalent to this level who were transferred for short-term rotations as commune members. Among the cadres in service throughout the province, all except those who were old and sick or unable to participate in labor for other reasons participated in physical labor. By the beginning of December, more than 70% of the cadres had participated in one month of labor. Cadres in county-level organs generally participated in labor for more than a month and a half.

Almost all cadres working in rural areas throughout the province participated in the activity of planting experimental fields. In 32 counties and cities in Yulin, Hanzhong, and the Guanzhong area, a total of 35,111 cadres participated in planting experimental fields, managing a total of 5,480 mu of land. The yield of experimental fields is generally higher than the yield of large-area high-yield fields. For example, the wheat experimental field of Hu Chongde, Secretary of the CPC Liquan People's Commune Committee in Qian County, achieved a yield of 2,012 jin per mu, which is 7.5 times higher than the local average yield per mu.

Through physical labor, cadres at all levels established deep feelings with the masses, and many villages and farm households became the second hometown of organ cadres. Cadres often communicated with the masses even after returning to the organs. After many leading cadres participated in labor, they improved their leadership style and strengthened specific leadership over grassroots work. At present, in order to strengthen the winter feeding management of live pigs, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee recently called on county party secretaries and commune party secretaries to serve as feeders for one month. Now, many county party secretaries and commune party secretaries have arrived at pig farms and are studying the feeding management of live pigs.

    既锻炼了干部　又推动了生产
    安徽江西陕西数十万干部通过生产劳动思想越炼越红
    据新华社合肥10日电　安徽省县以上机关、厂矿、学校和人民团体等1959年共有三十万一千多名干部参加了劳动锻炼，共做了一千四百五十三万一千多个劳动日，平均每人劳动近四十五天。
    各地干部通过劳动锻炼，增强了阶级观点、劳动观点、群众观点，改进了工作作风。许多青年知识分子干部在劳动中亲身体验到劳动人民的高尚品质，认识到劳动光荣，群众伟大，同群众建立了深厚的感情。肥东县民政科干部王东初，下放到高亮公社柏岭大队后，住在一家姓赵的社员家里，经常利用休息时间帮助挑水、打扫院子和做其它家务劳动，房东老大娘把他看成自己的儿子一样，非常信任他，有事外出就把钥匙交给他保管。中共霍山县委农村工作部干部鲁本厚，下放到佛子岭公社劳动锻炼期间，因挑担不慎把腰扭伤了，六十多岁的陈老大娘不辞劳苦，满山遍野地寻找“追红藤”药草，为他治愈了腰伤。
    领导干部参加体力劳动后，及时地了解工作中的情况，总结经验，指导工作更加具体。中共乐至县委第一书记宋毓秀在下放青山公社老屋生产队当社员期间，帮助基层干部算清账目，解决分配问题，调动了社员的生产积极性，促进了生产的发展。中共庐江县委第一书记湛先余下放马厂公社当社员期间，帮助整顿公共食堂，建立和健全管理制度，做出多样饭菜，改善了社员的生活。社员们赞扬说：“书记亲自下食堂，粗粮细作多花样，吃了书记做的饭，浑身是劲把活干，吃了书记做的菜，生产跃进百花开。”
    干部通过劳动锻炼还学会了很多生产知识。下放到农村进行劳动锻炼的干部，一般都学会了挑担、车水、犁田、播种、耘草、收割等基本农活。下放到工厂矿山的干部，也学会了一定的生产知识和操作技术。许多干部在劳动中同群众一道，积极钻研技术，创造和仿制先进工具，提高了劳动生产效率。
    干部参加劳动也直接为国家创造了大量物质财富。仅据省直属机关统计，他们共开垦耕种土地三千三百亩，收获各种粮食四十六万多斤、油料四万四千三百多斤、蔬菜三百多万斤，饲养生猪二万五千八百多头，鱼二百六十七万多尾。
    安徽省各级领导机关在组织干部参加体力劳动时，特别注意围绕各个时期的生产和工作中心进行，把锻炼干部和推动生产紧密结合起来。在去年春季整顿人民公社时，全省就抽调了五万五千九百多名干部下乡，一面工作，一面参加体力劳动。在夏季抢收早稻、抢栽晚稻和抗旱时，全省组织了十万多名干部下乡参加为期两三个月的劳动。这样就既锻炼了干部，又推动了生产和工作。
    据新华社南昌10日电　江西省县以上领导机关在过去一年中，有十万五千多名干部下放到人民公社和工厂矿山参加劳动锻炼，劳动总天数达二百九十二万多天。其中有县级以上领导干部五千一百多人，占全省县以上领导干部总数64．15％，包括中共江西省委委员、省级机关的厅局长、地委书记、专员和县委书记、县长等。
    各级干部下放到基层参加劳动锻炼以后，能以切身感受来考察党的方针政策在基层贯彻执行的情况，从而不断地改进工作作风，进一步密切了党和群众的联系。中共抚州地委第一书记王敬民，在去年早稻插秧时到临川县湖南人民公社春光大队参加劳动，他发现少数稻田有的栽得过密，有的又栽得过稀，就同群众一道研究，提出了一个合理进行密植的意见，群众普遍表示满意。因为其他地方也有同样的问题，王敬民就建议县委召开现场会议，总结和推广春光大队的经验，这种工作方法就使工作做得更加切合实际，更加有效得多。中共南昌县委财贸部副部长萧招唤到富山公社文坊大队参加劳动，他看到湖山小队肥料不足，就同小队干部一起发动群众做了三十多个田头窖，积肥一千九百多担。群众称赞他说：“下放干部是尖兵，到了哪里哪里红，千重困难能突破，落后也要变先进。”
    干部参加体力劳动，对于加强劳动观点，增强劳动人民的思想感情，增强体质，都起了很大的作用。江西省冶金设计院干部柳瑶汁过去不安心工作。去年他下放到一个矿山参加劳动后，看见老工人不怕困难英勇劳动的情形后，深深受到感动。他真正认识到了工人阶级是最伟大的阶级，只有认真向工人学习，才能很好地改造自己。现在他不但安心工作，并且被评为先进工作者，他工作的那一个组也被评为青年红旗组。
    本报讯　陕西省各级机关干部一年来普遍参加体力劳动锻炼，获得了很大的成绩。据不完全统计，全省在职干部参加体力劳动达到六百多万个劳动日。
    去年全省从机关下放到农村工厂进行较长时间劳动锻炼的干部，共有九千二百多人；短期下放轮流当社员的省委书记、省长、省级厅长局长、地委书记、专员、县委书记、县长和相当于这一级的领导干部，共有两千五百多人。全省在职干部中，除年老多病或其它原因不能参加劳动的人外，全部都参加了体力劳动。到12月初，70％以上的干部都参加了一个月的劳动。县级机关干部参加劳动的时间，一般都在一个半月以上。
    全省在农村工作的干部几乎人人都参加了种植试验田的活动。榆林、汉中和关中地区的三十二个县市，参加种试验田的干部共三万五千一百一十一人，共经营土地五千四百八十亩。试验田的产量一般都高于大面积丰产田的产量。例如乾县醴泉人民公社党委书记胡崇德种植的回茬小麦试验田，亩产达到二千零一十二斤，高出当地平均亩产的七点五倍。
    通过体力劳动，各级机关干部和群众建立了深厚的感情，许多村庄和农户变成了机关干部的第二个家乡，干部回到机关后还同群众经常通信。许多领导干部参加劳动以后，改进了领导作风，加强了对基层工作的具体领导。目前，为了加强生猪的冬季饲养管理工作，陕西省委最近号召县委书记和公社党委书记当一个月的饲养员。现在，许多县委书记和公社党委书记都已经到达养猪场，正在研究生猪的饲养管理工作。
