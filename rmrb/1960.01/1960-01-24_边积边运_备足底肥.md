　　Accumulate and Transport Fertilizer Simultaneously: Prepare Sufficient Base Fertilizer

　　(Our dispatch) The simultaneous advancement of fertilizer accumulation and transportation in Zhenghe County, Fujian, has not only provided sufficient base fertilizer for early rice fields but also achieved a major victory in fertilizer transportation. Currently, out of the more than 17 million dan of farm manure accumulated throughout the county, over 14.4 million dan have been transported to the fields, accounting for 85% of the total accumulated fertilizer. This averages 170 dan per mu of early rice field, basically meeting the base fertilizer needs of the rice fields.

　　Zhenghe County, with its overlapping mountains and remote location, has 80% of its fields in terraces and hillside paddies. To completely change the low-yield situation of the mountain fields and achieve a new leap forward this year, the county party committee required an average application of 150 dan of base fertilizer per mu of early rice field, with all fertilizer to be transported to the fields before the Spring Festival.

　　To solve the fertilizer accumulation and transportation problem in one go, Zhenghe County made overall arrangements for fertilizer accumulation and transportation from the very beginning of the fertilizer accumulation campaign, vigorously promoting basic construction for field-side fertilizer accumulation, advocating on-site accumulation, on-site storage, and on-site application. According to incomplete statistics, more than 10,000 field-side fertilizer pits have been dug throughout the county, accumulating over 1 million dan of fertilizer; more than 12,000 ash sheds have been built in the fields, also accumulating nearly 1 million dan of fertilizers such as grass ash and mountain bark ash. These two items alone can save more than 100,000 labor days. In order to ensure that even remote mountain fields can be fertilized with pig manure, various communes and teams have built pigsties in the fields on a large scale. More than 7,800 field-side pigsties have been built throughout the county, which can accumulate more than 2,300 dan of pig manure every day, and ensure that the pig manure flows directly to the fields.

　　In the fertilizer transportation process, the various communes and teams in Zhenghe County launched a high-efficiency movement centered on tool reform, using wooden boats and rafts to transport fertilizer, using aerial cableways to transport fertilizer, and using wooden tracks and bamboo slides to transport fertilizer, enabling high-speed fertilizer transportation and saving a large amount of labor.

　　In order to accelerate fertilizer transportation, Zhenghe County also summarized and promoted the experience of "picking up sheep along the way," which involves carrying manure uphill and mountain fertilizer downhill. In the past three months, using this method, more than 3 million dan of fertilizer have been transported, saving more than 200,000 labor days. More than 8,000 commune members engaged in developing tea mountains have also accumulated and transported more than 2 million dan of fertilizer in conjunction with developing tea mountains. At present, Zhenghe County's fertilizer accumulation and transportation campaign is being carried out in depth, and the vast number of commune members are determined to accumulate and transport more and better fertilizer for spring planting.

    边积边运　备足底肥
    本报讯　福建政和县积肥运肥齐头并进，在为早稻田积足基肥的同时，取得了运肥大捷。目前全县已积的一千七百多万担农家肥料中，已运送到田头的达一千四百四十多万担，占总积肥量的85％，平均每亩早稻田有一百七十担，基本满足了稻田基肥需要。
    政和县山岭重叠，是个偏远的山区，全县80％的田地是梯田、山垅田。为了彻底改变山田低产面貌，实现今年的新跃进，县委要求每亩早稻田地平均施基肥一百五十担，并要在春节前把肥料全部运送到田。
    为了使积肥运肥一举解决，政和县在积肥运动一开始，就把积肥运肥进行统筹安排，大搞田头积肥基本建设，提倡就地积肥，就地贮存，就地施用。根据不完全的统计，全县已挖了一万多个田头肥坑，沤积了一百多万担肥料；田头搭了灰棚一万二千多个，也聚积了草木灰、山皮灰等肥料近百万担，单这两项就可以节省十多万个劳动日。各个公社为使边远山田也能施上猪肥，纷纷在田头大建猪栏，全县已建立田头猪栏七千八百多座，每天可积猪肥二千三百多担，并做到猪肥自流到田。
    政和县各个社队在运肥中开展了以工具改革为中心的高工效运动，用木船、木排运肥，用空中索道运肥，用木轨道、竹滑道运肥，使运肥高速度前进，节省了大批劳力。
    为了加速运肥，政和县还总结推广了上山带粪肥、下山带山肥的“顺手牵羊”的运肥经验。近三个月来，采用这一办法，已运肥三百多万担，节省了二十多万个劳动日。全县从事开垦茶山的八千多个社员也结合开垦茶山积运肥料二百多万担。目前，政和全县的积肥运肥运动正在深入开展，广大社员决心要为春种田地积运更多更好的肥料。
