Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 31st: On the evening of December 30th, the national Red Flag ship "Zhongxing No. 9" ocean passenger and cargo ship slowly left Qingdao Port amidst a long whistle and sailed out of the beautiful Jiaozhou Bay. Now, she is sailing on the Yellow Sea, braving the wind and waves, to welcome the first dawn of 1960 there.

At dawn on the 29th, "Zhongxing No. 9" arrived smoothly in Qingdao, facing the morning breeze, delivering the last batch of passengers and goods of the year from Shanghai. All the crew members sent a telegram to the Shanghai Maritime Administration, reporting how they prepared for this "good start" in Qingdao in just over a day. With excitement, the crew cleaned the deck, arranged the cabins, hung banners and slogans celebrating the New Year, and overhauled the machinery to prevent freezing, making the ship look brand new inside and out. They warmly received the passengers and helped the dockworkers load pig iron into the ship, which was a New Year's gift for the Shanghai steel factory. A meeting was held on board to celebrate the victory of 1959 and welcome the continued leap forward in 1960. Everyone was determined to be a good "pioneer" in the coming new year, to better receive passengers, and to transport more goods.

    红旗船海上迎新年
    据新华社上海31日电30日傍晚，全国红旗船“中兴九号”海洋客货轮在汽笛长鸣声中，缓缓地离开青岛港码头，驶出美丽的胶州湾。现在她正乘风破浪，航行在黄海海面，在那里迎接1960年的第一个黎明。
    29日拂晓，“中兴九号”迎着晨风，顺利抵达青岛，从上海送去了今年的最后一批旅客和货物。全体船员给上海海运管理局打了一份电报，汇报他们在青岛的一天多时间里面，怎样准备这次“开门红”。船员们怀着兴奋的心情，擦洗甲板，布置舱房，挂起庆祝新年的横幅和标语，检修机器，做好防冻工作，使轮船里里外外焕然一新，他们殷勤地接待旅客，并且帮助码头工人把生铁装进轮船，这是准备带给上海钢铁工厂的新年礼物。船上举行了庆祝1959年胜利、迎接1960年继续跃进的大会，大家决心在即将来临的新的一年里，当好“先行官”，更好地接待旅客，更多地运输货物。
