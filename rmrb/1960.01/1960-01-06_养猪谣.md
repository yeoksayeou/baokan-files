Pig Raising Rhyme
　　Wen Bing

　　Cutting pig grass, the rooster crows, crows, gets up early to go to the pond to cut pig grass; I cut the grass, my brother carries it, let's see who has the higher drive. Swing the sickle a few times, cut a load, my brother sweats with every trip; back at the commune, my brother raises an opinion, requesting to change to a bigger carrying pole!

　　Taking the bucket, carrying water, carrying water to bathe the pigs; washing their heads, washing their waists, washing them clean so they grow big and fat. The piglets scramble to have me wash them, the sow watches and stares with a smile...

　　Sister-in-law is diligent, sister-in-law is quick, everyone says sister-in-law is good at raising pigs; diligently adding water, often adding feed, giving injections and delivering babies, doing everything; getting up several times at night, walking around the pigsty without sleeping; the pigs see sister-in-law coming, affectionately grabbing her clothes and following her...

    养猪谣
    文丙
    割猪草花公鸡，喔喔叫，起早下塘割猪草；我割草，哥哥挑，比比谁的干劲高。挥几镰，割一担，哥哥一趟趟直流汗；回社哥哥提意见，要求换根大扁担！
    洗澡担起桶，把水挑，挑水给猪洗洗澡；洗洗头，洗洗腰，洗得干净长大膘。小猪争着叫我洗，母猪瞧着瞪眼笑　……。
    嫂嫂勤嫂嫂，快嫂嫂，都说嫂嫂养猪好；勤加水，常添料，打针接生样样搞；夜来起床好几遍，绕着猪圈不睡觉；群猪瞧见嫂嫂来，亲着她衣角跟她跑……。
