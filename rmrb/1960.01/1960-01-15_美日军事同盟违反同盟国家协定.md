The military alliance treaty that the U.S. government and the Japanese government are preparing to sign on January 19 is a war treaty that endangers peace in Asia and the world. This aggressive treaty completely violates a series of international agreements that allied nations concluded during World War II and after Japan's surrender, which stipulated that Japanese militarist forces must be eradicated, making Japan a peaceful, democratic, and independent nation.

In order to prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism, the Allied nations concluded international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation during World War II. The Potsdam Proclamation explicitly declared: "The authority and influence of those, who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be eliminated forever. For we insist that a new order of peace, security and justice will be impossible until irresponsible militarianism is driven from the world."

After the war, the Allied nations that fought against Japan formed the Far Eastern Commission as an institution to formulate policies for the control of Japan. On June 19, 1947, the Far Eastern Commission passed a resolution on basic postwar policy toward Japan, which stated: "The policy toward Japan following surrender should be based on the following ultimate goals: (A) To ensure that Japan will no longer become a threat to world peace and security. (B) To establish as rapidly as possible a democratic and peaceful government..." The Far Eastern Commission also passed international documents such as the resolution on the destruction of Japan's military industry and the resolution on prohibiting Japanese military activities and disposing of Japanese military equipment.

These wartime and postwar international agreements are the guidelines and international laws for dealing with postwar Japan. The U.S. government is a signatory to these international agreements, and it has an inescapable obligation to abide by them.

However, U.S. imperialism has been perfidious and has consistently undermined the aforementioned international agreements. After occupying Japan, the United States colluded with Japanese reactionaries to intensify the suppression of the Japanese people and revive Japanese militarism. In 1951, the United States, in violation of the provision in the United Nations Declaration that no separate peace treaty could be concluded, unilaterally convened the San Francisco Conference and signed the separate peace treaty with Japan. This "peace treaty" itself violated international agreements such as the Potsdam Proclamation. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries also used this "peace treaty" to unilaterally lift the constraints imposed by the Potsdam Proclamation and other international agreements on Japan's aggressive forces. The United States then signed "security treaties" and "administrative agreements" with Japan, turning Japan into a U.S. military base and colony. The new U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, which is about to be signed in the name of revising the "security treaty," is designed to meet the needs of the United States in actively preparing for nuclear war, to make the already revived Japanese militarism an accomplice of U.S. aggression, and thus is also a more thorough trampling on relevant international agreements.

The Potsdam Proclamation stipulates that it is necessary to destroy "the power of Japan to make war." The Far Eastern Commission's resolution on basic postwar policy toward Japan stipulates that Japan shall not possess the means of war and shall "completely eliminate the power of its military departments and the influence of militarism, and strictly prohibit all systems that express militarism and the spirit of aggression." However, as is well known, as a result of the United States' active rearmament of Japan, the number and firepower of the Japanese army, navy, and air force in the name of "Self-Defense Forces" have long exceeded those before the war. The capacity for military production has reached 100 billion yen. The United States has also illegally released Japanese war criminals who have committed heinous crimes, removed restrictions, restored the activities of a large number of fascists, and supported militarist groups to rebuild Japan's aggressive forces. According to Japanese newspaper reports, based on the principles of the Vandenberg Resolution used by the United States to piece together military blocs, Article 3 of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty stipulates that the two contracting parties will "separately or through mutual cooperation implement continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid" to maintain and develop armed forces. This actually obligates Japan to engage in military collusion with the United States and continuously develop nuclear armaments. Articles 4, 5, and 6 of the treaty also stipulate that Japan will continue to provide military bases to the United States, and the United States and Japan will jointly "take action" to deal with "any armed attack against either party in the territory under Japanese administration," and will "consult at any time when either contracting party believes that international peace and security in the Far East or the security of Japan has been threatened." These clauses themselves, as well as the interpretations of this treaty by Japanese government leaders including Nobusuke Kishi, indicate that the "authority and influence to conquer the world" and "irresponsible militarism" pointed out in the Potsdam Proclamation have been revived, and are colluding with U.S. imperialism, attempting to re-launch the "Japanese aggression" that the Allied nations solemnly stated in the Cairo Declaration must be stopped, and once again become a "threat to world peace and security."

The United States' consistent actions to undermine international agreements such as the Potsdam Proclamation have been strongly condemned from the beginning by the people of all countries who paid a heavy price to defeat Japanese militarist aggression. Now the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are going even further and brazenly preparing to conclude a military alliance treaty. They must bear the responsibility for undermining international agreements and will inevitably suffer the consequences of their actions.

### 美日军事同盟违反同盟国家协定

    美日军事同盟违反同盟国家协定
    美国政府和日本政府准备在1月19日签订的军事同盟条约，是危害亚洲和世界和平的战争条约。这个侵略性的条约完全违反了同盟国家在第二次世界大战期间和日本投降以后曾经缔结过的一系列国际协定，这些协定规定，必须铲除日本军国主义势力，使日本成为和平、民主、独立的国家。
    为了制止日本军国主义再起，盟国在第二次世界大战期间缔结了开罗宣言、波茨坦公告等国际协定。波茨坦公告明确宣布：“欺骗及错误领导日本人民，使其妄欲征服世界之威权及势力，必须永久剔除。盖吾人坚持非将负责之穷兵黩武主义驱逐出世界，则和平安全及正义之新秩序势不可能。”
    战后，对日作战的盟国组成了远东委员会，作为制订管制日本政策的机构。远东委员会在1947年6月19日通过对投降后日本之基本政策的决议，决议指出：“对投降后日本之政策应依据下列最终目标：（甲）保证日本不再成为世界和平与安全之威胁。（乙）尽速树立一民主和平之政府……。”远东委员会并通过了关于摧毁日本军需工业的决议、关于禁止日本军事活动与处置日本军事装备的决议等国际文件。
    这些战时和战后的国际协定是处理战后日本问题的准绳和国际法规。美国政府是这些国际协定的签字国，它负有不容逃避的遵守这些协定的义务。
    但是美帝国主义背信弃义，一贯破坏上述国际协定。美国在占领日本以后，就勾结日本反动派加紧镇压日本人民，复活日本军国主义。1951年，美国违背联合国家共同宣言中不得单独媾和的规定，单独召开了旧金山会议，签订了对日单独和约，这个“和约”本身就破坏了波茨坦公告等国际协定。美日反动派并且利用这个“和约”来片面解除波茨坦公告等国际协定对日本侵略势力的约束力。美国又与日本签订“安全条约”、“行政协定”等，把日本变成美国的军事基地和殖民地。现在以修改“安全条约”为名将要签订的新的日美军事同盟条约，是为了适应美国积极准备核战争的需要，使已经复活的日本军国主义充当美国的侵略鹰犬，从而也是对有关的国际协定的更彻底的蹂躏。
    波茨坦公告规定，必需毁灭“日本制造战争之力量”。远东委员会对投降后日本之基本政策的决议规定，日本不得拥有战争手段，并应“完全消灭其军部权力与军国主义之影响，严格取缔一切表现军国主义与侵略精神之制度。”然而，如所周知，美国积极重新武装日本的结果，目前，以“自卫队”为名的日本陆海空军的人数和火力早已大大超过战前。军火生产能力已达一千亿日元。美国并且非法释放血债累累的日本战犯，解除整肃，恢复大批法西斯份子的活动，扶植军国主义团体，来重建日本的侵略势力。据日本报纸报道，根据美国用来拼凑军事集团的范登堡决议的原则，美日军事同盟条约第三条规定，两缔约国将“单独或与通力合作实行不断而有效的自助和互助”，以维护和发展武装力量。这实际上使日本承担了与美国进行军事勾结、不断发展核武装的义务。条约的第四、五、六条还规定，日本要继续向美国提供军事基地，美日两国将共同“采取行动”对付“对于在日本施政权所及领土上任何一方发动的武装进攻”，并且“在缔约国任何一方认为远东的国际和平和安全或者日本国的安全已经受到威胁的时候，随时进行协商”。这些条款本身以及包括岸信介在内的日本政府首脑对这个条约的解释表明，波茨坦公告中指出的“妄欲征服世界之威权及势力”、“穷兵黩武主义”，已经死灰复燃，并且与美帝国主义狼狈为奸，妄图重新发动盟国在开罗宣言中曾经严正表示必须制止的“日本之侵略”，并且再次成为“世界和平与安全之威胁”。
    美国一贯破坏波茨坦公告等国际协定的行为，自始就遭到曾经为打败日本军国主义侵略付出重大代价的各国人民的强烈谴责。现在美日反动派进而悍然准备缔结军事同盟条约，它们必须承担破坏国际协定的责任，并且必将自食恶果。
