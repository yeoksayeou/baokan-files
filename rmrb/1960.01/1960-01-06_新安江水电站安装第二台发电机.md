Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 5th: The domestically made hydroelectric generator unit with a capacity of 72,500 kilowatts has recently been installed at the Xin'an River Hydropower Station. As soon as the reservoir water level reaches the power generation elevation, the newly installed generator unit will be able to generate electricity immediately. Currently, the workers constructing the Xin'an River Hydropower Station are speeding up the installation of the second 72,500-kilowatt generator unit.

The Xin'an River Hydropower Station is one of the large-scale hydropower stations currently under construction in our country, built on the Xin'an River, a tributary of the Qiantang River, the largest river in Zhejiang. Construction began in full swing in 1957. Once completed, its power generation capacity will be greater than that of the currently largest operational Fengman Hydropower Station in our country. The electricity generated by this power station will be transmitted to Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuhu, and other places via high-voltage lines.

    新安江水电站安装第二台发电机
    新华社杭州5日电我　国自制的功率为七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机组，最近已在新安江水电站安装好。只待电站的蓄水到达发电高程以后，新安装的发电机组就能马上发电。目前，建设新安江水电站的职工正在加快步伐安装第二号七万二千五百瓩发电机组。
    新安江水电站是我国目前正在兴建中的大型水电站之一，建设在浙江最大的河流——钱塘江上游支流的新安江上。它是1957年全面动工兴建的，全部建成以后，发电能力比我国目前最大的、正在运转中的丰满水电站还要大。这座电站发出的电力，将通过高压线输送到南京、上海、杭州、芜湖等地。
