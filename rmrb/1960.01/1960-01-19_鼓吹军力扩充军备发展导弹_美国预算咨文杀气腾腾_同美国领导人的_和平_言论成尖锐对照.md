Xinhua News Agency, January 18th, Washington Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower, in his budget message to Congress today for the 1961 fiscal year, requested an appropriation of over 45.5 billion U.S. dollars for direct military spending and vigorously advocated strengthening U.S. military power. The substance of this budget message stands in sharp contrast to the "peace" rhetoric recently voiced by U.S. leaders.

Eisenhower also stated in the message that America's "national goal" is "to achieve a just peace for all peoples" and "the hope that the burden of armaments weighing on the world can be lightened."

However, he repeatedly clamored that "in seeking genuine avenues toward peace and disarmament, we must maintain strength" and pay attention to "modernizing" the U.S. "armed forces."

Eisenhower said that "the strategy and tactics of American military power are undergoing one of the greatest changes in history," namely, "shifting the emphasis from conventional warfare to missile warfare." At the same time, he said that in doing so, the U.S. "must remember not to overemphasize one form of warfare while neglecting another." He belligerently stated that America's military forces must be able to successfully undertake everything from "limited emergencies to full-scale nuclear war."

Eisenhower proposed that in the 1961 fiscal year, the U.S. should increase appropriations for the procurement of missiles, strengthen the development of new weapons, and at the same time, maintain the current active military strength.

Eisenhower continued to advocate the bankrupt "nuclear deterrent" strategy. According to him, the U.S. armed forces have two strategic components: "nuclear retaliatory capability" and "the ability to conduct other necessary operations in any form of war." "Representing the first capability is a combined force of manned bombers, carrier-based aircraft, and intercontinental and intermediate-range missiles. Representing the second capability are land, sea, and air forces distributed in important forward areas, as well as readily available reserve forces that can be quickly reinforced in emergencies."

He acknowledged that, given the rapid development of military technology, "some weapons systems become obsolete even as they are being produced, and some become obsolete even as they are being developed."

He clamored for the need for the U.S. to "constantly study and re-evaluate" its military plans "in order to reallocate resources, invest them in newer and more important weapons systems, and stop or reduce efforts on those outdated weapons systems." Eisenhower listed some adjustments that the U.S. has already made in this regard in the message. He admitted that the "Jupiter" and "Thor" intermediate-range missiles that the U.S. is already producing, and the F-108 long-range interceptor being developed, are already outdated. He said that in the 1961 fiscal year, the U.S. government will order more "Atlas" intercontinental missiles, "Titan" intercontinental missiles, and submarine-launched "Polaris" missiles, begin producing three more submarines capable of launching "Polaris" missiles, and "continue to develop and begin production of the first batch of practically usable Minuteman missiles." In this way, the U.S. will "develop and produce four strategic ballistic missile systems" in the next fiscal year. In addition, "the development and production of nuclear weapons will remain at the high levels of previous years."

Eisenhower also recommended purchasing more improved B-52 aircraft, procuring B-58 supersonic medium bombers, and continuing to equip B-52 bomber wings with "Hound Dog" air-to-ground missiles.

Eisenhower also said that U.S. military aid to its allies "will also reflect" the "increasing importance" of modern weapons and missiles.

On the other hand, ignoring the example of the Soviet Union's substantial reduction of armed forces, Eisenhower again demanded that the U.S. military personnel "maintain approximately the current level" of more than 2.48 million in the new fiscal year. He also recommended the construction of twenty new ships, including one attack aircraft carrier. In addition, another fifteen ships will be converted or modernized.

The message also called on NATO countries to bear more military expenses to purchase "expensive new weapons" and stipulated that the "training work" of the U.S.'s Western European allies' troops should be "strengthened" to ensure that they can "effectively use and maintain new equipment"; and that the "conventional forces" of some countries and regions in the Near East and Far East participating in U.S.-assembled military blocs should be "strengthened."

Although Eisenhower boasted extensively about America's "strength," his message also reflected the fear of the "strength-based position" believers after losing their "strength-based position." Due to the U.S.'s significant lag in intercontinental missiles, he said that the U.S. has already dispersed the aircraft of the Strategic Air Command and built alarm equipment, and "will also disperse strategic missiles in underground launching sites with solid equipment." He also said that the U.S. has spent approximately 17 billion U.S. dollars to establish an air defense system, but "some parts have not yet been completed." He said that in the 1961 fiscal year, the U.S. will continue to develop "Nike-Hercules" surface-to-air missiles, "Bomarc" interceptor missiles, and "further modernize" radar alarms, electronic control, and communication systems.

### 鼓吹军力扩充军备发展导弹  美国预算咨文杀气腾腾  同美国领导人的“和平”言论成尖锐对照

    鼓吹军力扩充军备发展导弹
    美国预算咨文杀气腾腾
    同美国领导人的“和平”言论成尖锐对照
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔在今天向国会提出的1961财政年度预算咨文中，要求拨出直接军费四百五十五亿多美元，并且大肆鼓吹加强美国军事实力。这个预算咨文的实质同美国领导人最近发表的一些“和平”言论形成了尖锐的对照。
    艾森豪威尔在咨文里也说什么美国的“国家目标”是“使各国人民得到正义的和平”和“希望压在世界身上的军备重担能够减轻”。
    但是，他又口口声声叫喊“在寻求走向和平和裁军的真正的道路时必须保持强大”，要注意使美国“武装部队的现代化”。
    艾森豪威尔说，“美国军事力量的战略和战术正在经历着历史上最大的变化之一”，即“把重点从常规战争改变到导弹战争”。同时，他又说，美国在这样作时“必须记住不能重视一种形式的战争而忽视另一种形式的战争”。他杀气腾腾地说，美国的军事力量必须能够成功地担当起从“有限的紧急事件直到全面的原子核大战”。
    艾森豪威尔提出，在1961财政年度，美国要增加采购导弹的拨款，加强发展新式武器，同时继续保持目前的现役军事力量。
    艾森豪威尔继续鼓吹已经破产的“核威慑”战略。据他说美国武装部队中有两个战略组成部分：“核报复能力”和“在任何形式的战争中进行其他必要活动的能力”。“代表第一种能力的是有人驾驶的轰炸机、以航空母舰为基地的飞机以及洲际导弹和中程导弹的联合力量。代表第二种能力的是分布在重要的前沿地区的陆、海、空军部队，以及能够在紧急情况下迅速增援的随时准备着的后备部队。”
    他承认，鉴于军事技术的迅速发展，美国“某些武器体系尚在生产的时候就变得过时了，有些则尚在发展的时候就变得过时了”。
    他叫喊美国有必要“不断研究和重新估计”它的军事计划，“以便重新调度资源，把它们投在较新的和较重要的武器系统上，以及停止或者减少在那些已经过时的武器体系上所作的努力”。艾森豪威尔在咨文中列举了美国在这方面已经作出的一些调整。他承认美国已经在生产的“丘辟特式”和“雷神式”中程导弹和正在研究的F—一○八型远程截击机等已经落后了，他说，在1961财政年度，美国政府将订购更多的“阿特拉斯式”洲际导弹、“大力神式”洲际导弹和潜艇上发射的“北极星式”导弹，再开始生产三艘发射“北极星式”导弹的潜艇，并且“继续发展和开始生产第一批可以实际使用的民兵式导弹”。这样，美国在下一财政年度中“将发展和生产四项战略弹道导弹体系”。另外，“核武器的发展和生产将保持在前几年的高水平上”。
    艾森豪威尔还建议更多地购买作了改进的B—四二型飞机，并采购B—五八型超音速中型轰炸机，以及继续用“猎狗式”空对地导弹来装备B—五二轰炸机联队。
    艾森豪威尔还说，美国给它的盟国的军事援助，“也将反映”现代武器和导弹的“日益增长的重要性”。
    另一方面，艾森豪威尔不顾苏联将大量裁减武装部队的榜样，又要求在新的财政年度中使美国军事人员“保持大约目前的水平”，即二百四十八万多人。他还建议，要建造二十艘新舰只，其中包括一艘攻击航空母舰。此外并改建另外十五艘舰只或使其现代化。
    咨文还要北大西洋集团国家负担更多的军费，来购置“价格昂贵的新武器”，并规定要“加强”对美国的西欧盟国军队的“训练工作”，保证他们能够“有效地使用和保持新装备”；加强近东和远东参加美国拼凑的军事集团的一些国家和地区的“常规部队”。
    虽然艾森豪威尔大肆吹嘘美国的“实力”，但他的咨文还反映了“实力地位”的信徒在失去“实力地位”以后的恐惧。由于美国在洲际导弹方面大大落后，他说，美国已经在分散战略空军司令部的飞机和建造警报设备，还“将把战略导弹分散在有坚固设备的地下发射场中”。他还说，美国已经花了约一百七十亿美元来建立一个防空系统，但是“某些部分还没有完成”。他说，在1961财政年度美国将继续发展“奈克—赫尔克里士式”地对空导弹，“鲍马克”截击式导弹，并且使雷达警报、电子控制和通讯等系统“进一步实现现代化”。
