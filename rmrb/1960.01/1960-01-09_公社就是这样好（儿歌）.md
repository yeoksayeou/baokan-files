The Commune Is Just This Good (Nursery Rhyme)
Jin Jin
A car drives to the top of the mountain
There is a newly made road,
Winding and turning, climbing to the mountaintop,
The car passes through dense woods,
Driving straight to the commune's entrance.
There are many big trees on the mountain,
Older than grandpa,
They all want to come down the mountain,
To build a lovely new nation.
This used to be a dream,
Fallen trees couldn't be moved,
Only one log could be carried per day,
Watching the trees rot away.
Now come big trucks,
Carrying dozens of logs at once,
Just hear a "toot toot" sound,
They've already run to the foot of the mountain.
One big truck drives away,
Another one quickly arrives,
They're carrying away wood,
Bringing in machines and wires.
Our Dining Hall
In our public dining hall,
There are incredibly many vegetables,
Eating fresh vegetables all year round,
Having cultivated ten mu of vegetable gardens.
We can't finish eating the fresh vegetables,
Sending them to the city for support,
There are still plenty of green vegetables and radishes,
Pickling several vats and then drying them.
Wax gourds, garlic, everything is complete,
Three meals a day with fresh changes,
Homemade tender tofu,
Grandpas and grandmas like it the most.
The dining hall raises pigs and chickens,
Each one is raised big and fat,
When it's time for the Spring Festival this year,
We can hold a banquet.

    公社就是这样好（儿歌）
    金近汽车开到山头上有一条新做的公路，弯弯曲曲爬到山头，汽车穿过密密树林，一直开到公社大门口。山上有好多大树，年纪比爷爷还大，它们都想下山来，建设可爱的新国家。从前这是个梦想，倒下的大树没法搬，一天只能背一根，眼看着大树都腐烂。现在来了大汽车，一次能背几十根，只听嘟嘟一声叫，早就跑到山下面。大汽车开走一辆，很快又开来一辆，他们搬走的是木头，搬来的是机器和电线。我们的食堂我们的公共食堂里，蔬菜多得了不起，一年四季吃鲜菜，开辟十亩菜园地。新鲜蔬菜吃不完，送到城里去支援，青菜萝卜还有多，腌上几缸再晒干。冬瓜大蒜样样全，一天三餐换新鲜，自己做的嫩豆腐，爷爷奶奶最喜欢。食堂养猪又养鸡，只只养得大又肥，等到今年过春节，我们可以办酒席。
