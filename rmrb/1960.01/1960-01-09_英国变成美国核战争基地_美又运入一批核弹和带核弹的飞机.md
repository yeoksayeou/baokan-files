Xinhua News Agency, London, 6th January: "Daily Express" reporter Chapman Pincher reported today that the US Air Force is about to ship another hundred nuclear bombs into Britain. This will bring the number of American nuclear weapons stored in Britain to at least five hundred.

Pincher said in a message published on the front page of the "Daily Express" that in the next few days, the US Air Force will ship at least another hundred nuclear bombs into Britain. These nuclear bombs will be stored at the huge US base at Lakenheath, Suffolk.

These weapons are precisely what De Gaulle refused to store in France, unless they were controlled by France.

These newly arrived bombs will bring the number of American nuclear weapons stored in Britain to at least five hundred, including hydrogen bombs, tactical atomic bombs, and missile warheads.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 6th January: Three squadrons of US Air Force Super Sabre fighter-bombers, capable of carrying nuclear bombs, began arriving today at the US base at Lakenheath, Suffolk, England. These aircraft took off from France and are part of the US nuclear weapons withdrawn from France, because De Gaulle refused to allow the US to store nuclear weapons in France unless these weapons were under French control.

These three squadrons consist of a total of seventy-five Super Sabre aircraft.

The nuclear bombs intended for these aircraft are being transported to Britain disassembled by transport planes, thereby increasing the number of nuclear bombs stored by the US Air Force in Britain, even though these nuclear bombs were already numerous.

    英国变成美国核战争基地
    美又运入一批核弹和带核弹的飞机
    新华社伦敦6日电　“每日快报”记者查普曼·平彻尔今天报道，美国空军即将把另外一百个核弹运入英国。这样，美国储存在英国的核武器的数目至少就要达到五百个。
    平彻尔在刊登于“每日快报”第一版的消息中说，在今后几天内，美国空军将把至少是另外一百个核弹运入英国。这些核弹将被储存在萨福克尔郡赖垦亥斯地方巨大的美国基地上。
    这些武器正是戴高乐拒绝储存在法国的，除非它们由法国控制。
    这些新运来的炸弹将使美国储存在英国的核武器至少达到五百个，其中有氢弹，战术原子弹以及导弹弹头。
    新华社伦敦6日电　能够携带核炸弹的美国空军超级佩刀式战斗轰炸机三个中队，从今天开始，陆续飞抵英国萨福尔克郡赖垦庆斯的美国基地。这些飞机是从法国起飞的，是美国从法国撤走的核武器的一部分，因为戴高乐拒绝美国在法国存放核武器，除非这些武器受法国控制。
    这三个中队共有七十五架超级佩刀式飞机。
    准备供这些飞机携带的核炸弹在拆开来以后由运输机搬到英国来，从而使美国空军贮存在英国的核弹增加，虽然这些核弹原来就已经不少。
