Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 14th: The Tanghe River Bridge in Henan Province, currently China's largest arch bridge made of rubble concrete, was completed and opened to traffic on January 12th. After the completion of this bridge, the traffic on the highways from Nanyang to Xinyang and Nanyang to Zhumadian will not be interrupted during the flood season on the Tanghe River.

The Tanghe River Bridge is 237.92 meters long and 22.9 meters high, allowing two trucks to run side by side; the sidewalks on both sides are 0.75 meters wide. The entire bridge has three large arches, each with a span of 63 meters. The central arch is a navigation channel, which can accommodate large ships weighing over 5,000 tons during the flood season. On each of the three large arches, there are eight small arches with a span of 3.5 meters, to reduce the weight of the bridge, reduce the amount of work, expand the flood season's water passage area, and make the bridge more beautiful. The completion of this bridge marks another improvement in China's concrete arch bridge construction technology.

The Tanghe River Bridge began construction in April last year. It does not use steel, but is entirely built with rubble concrete, rubble, and blue bricks. According to the past construction speed, it would take a year and a half to complete. However, under the leadership of the Party Committee at the construction site, the construction workers adopted indigenous methods, combined indigenous and foreign methods, and launched a massive technical innovation and technical revolution campaign, completing the entire project in just over eight months, saving the state more than 560,000 yuan, and the project quality is very good.

    河南建成我国跨径最大的片石混凝土拱桥
    唐河大桥下能通行载重五千多吨的轮船
    新华社郑州14日电　我国目前跨径最大的片石混凝土拱桥——河南省唐河大桥，已于1月12日建成通车。这座大桥建成后，能使南阳到信阳、南阳到驻马店公路的交通在唐河涨水期间不致中断。
    唐河大桥全长二百三十七点九二米，高二十二点九米，可并行两辆卡车；两边人行道各宽零点七五米。全桥共有三个大孔，每孔跨径六十三米，中间一孔为通航孔，在洪水到来时期能通航载重五千多吨的大轮船。在三个大孔上，又各设有八个跨径三点五米的小拱，以减轻桥体的重量，减少工程量，扩大汛期过水面积，同时使桥梁更为美观。这座桥梁的建成，标志着我国混凝土拱桥的建筑技术又有提高。
    唐河大桥是去年4月开始兴建的。它不用钢材，全部用片石混凝土、片石和青砖建筑，按照过去的建筑速度，需要一年半的时间才能全部建成。但是，建桥的职工们在工地党委领导下，采用土法上马、土洋结合的办法，大闹技术革新和技术革命，使整个工程在八个多月就完成了，为国家节约资金五十六万多元，而且工程质量很好。（附图片）
