    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 5th: Our correspondent reports: The Vietnamese Labor Party organizations in various parts of North Vietnam have achieved good results in developing new party members to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Labor Party (January 6th). As of now, nearly 10,000 outstanding workers, agricultural cooperative members, and revolutionary intellectuals have gloriously joined the Labor Party. This work is currently continuing.
    Currently, there are more than 400,000 Labor Party members in North Vietnam. Due to the deepening and development of the socialist revolution and economic construction, the Party's ranks urgently need to be expanded. On the other hand, in recent years, a large number of advanced elements have emerged on various fronts. They love the Labor Party, are full of confidence in socialism, can play an exemplary role in their work, and actively request to join the Party. The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, based on the requirements of this objective situation, issued instructions on October 22nd of last year regarding the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party, proposing to develop a number of new party members during the "January 6th" celebration period.
    Party committees at all levels attach great importance to the work of developing new party members. Through this work of developing new party members, the broad masses, especially the Communist Youth League members, workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres, have received profound education.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 5th: Volume 1 of "Thirty Years of Struggle of the Party," edited by the Propaganda and Education Committee and the Party History Research Committee of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, has been published and distributed today, with a print run of 300,000 copies.
    This book is divided into three volumes, and its second and third volumes will be published and distributed successively in the first quarter of this year.
    The Vietnamese Labor Party's newspaper "Nhan Dan" published an article today on the publication of the first volume of this book, saying, "We can see from this book the correct line formulated by the Party in the revolutionary movement over the past thirty years, and the spirit of struggle of the Vietnamese communists who have spared no sacrifice to realize the Party's propositions and line. On the road of struggle, they are not afraid of any brutal persecution by the enemy, nor do they fear any hardships and difficulties."
