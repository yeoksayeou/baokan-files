    Go Deep Among the Masses, Strengthen Learning
    Wang Anyou

    In the past few years, I had a period when I had a wrong idea that I was quite familiar with rural life, and as long as I improved my artistic skills, I could write something. I did not put political thought first, neglected political study and ideological transformation, and neglected going deep among the masses and personally participating in actual struggles, but instead buried myself in artistic skills for a while, writing a novel and several short stories, none of which succeeded. Later, thanks to the education of the Party, I improved my understanding and returned to the countryside.

    At that time, it was the period of agricultural socialist transformation. As soon as I got home, my relatives and neighbors came to me one after another. Some of these people were poor peasants, and some were well-to-do middle peasants. Some were activists in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and some were experts in production. My poor relatives praised the Party's policies as soon as they met me. The well-to-do middle peasants complained as soon as they met me. They were dissatisfied with the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, and even more dissatisfied with agricultural cooperatives, but they didn't say it directly, deliberately beating around the bush, saying that the policies of the higher authorities were good, but they were ruined by the village cadres. They said that the cadres were attacking him, and he couldn't survive, and some wanted to sell their belongings and go to Northeast China.

    I was born into a peasant family and had connections with the peasants in terms of thoughts and feelings. Seeing that those people were very emotional and described themselves as so pitiful, I sympathized with them in my mind. I suspected that some cadres' work styles might have problems, and there might be deviations in the implementation of policies. Later, I lived in the countryside for a long time and worked and lived with the masses. People farmed, I followed them to sow seeds, people winnowed, I swept the chaff in the upwind. I was not afraid of seasickness when going to sea. If they asked me to go, I went. If they didn't ask me, I still went. I felt that only by not being afraid of hardship could I train myself and improve myself. As time went by, I established close friendships with cadres and the masses. They helped me, made me learn many things, and also made me see through the faces of those who complained loudly. It turned out that they had developed into exploiters. Some engaged in usury, and some engaged in grain speculation. They tried every means to undermine socialist construction, and deliberately looked for excuses to attack cadres and poor peasants.

    Several years of work at the grassroots level have tempered me. I am a Party cadre, and I must often study the Party's policies and instructions. This has also improved my thinking, corrected my mistakes, and made me realize that the struggle between the two roads in the countryside is fierce and complex. Although the forms of expression are different, a careful analysis reveals that they all have class imprints. Why did I sympathize with those well-to-do peasants at the beginning? Objectively speaking, it was because I didn't understand the situation at the beginning, but subjectively it was because my viewpoint on the problem was not correct. This reflected that there were still non-proletarian thoughts in my mind. The facts educated me, and I realized that I had to work hard to strengthen the study of political theory and thoroughly transform my thinking. Only by looking at problems from the proletarian standpoint and viewpoint can I see through the truth of the spontaneous forces of capitalism. At the same time, only by personally participating in labor and struggle can I appreciate the greatness of the Party's leadership and appreciate the loveliness and approachability of those heroic figures.

    If I don't detach myself from life, I can write some novels that are in line with the current work in a timely manner. The reason why "Fishermen's Family on the Sea" can be written is mainly because I implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, went to the masses, personally participated in practical work, and went through a long period of struggle and accumulation. However, I haven't systematically studied Marxist-Leninist theoretical works enough, and my Party spirit and discipline are not strictly trained. Therefore, my thinking is still lagging behind the situation. Reflected in my works, I have not written enough about the communist style of heroic figures, and the Party's leadership is not written well enough. The experience has made me realize the importance of strengthening political study and striving to transform my thinking, and made me realize that without a proletarian world outlook, it is impossible to correctly reflect the revolutionary struggle of the working people. At the same time, if I do not personally participate in the revolutionary struggle of the people, I cannot truly understand the thoughts and feelings of the working people, nor can I understand their soaring enthusiasm and their communist thought of forgetting self for the sake of the public.

    深入群众，加强学习
    王安友
    我在前几年有过一个时期，产生过这样一个错误想法，认为我对农村生活比较熟悉，只要好好提高一下艺术技巧，就可以写出东西来。我没有把政治思想摆在第一位，忽视了政治学习和思想改造，忽视了深入群众和亲身参加实际斗争，却埋头钻了一阵子艺术技巧，写了一个长篇和几个短篇，都没有成功。后来由于党的教育，我提高了认识，重新回到乡下去。
    当时正是农业社会主义改造时期，我一到家，我的亲戚，我的邻居都陆续地找我来了。这些人有贫农也有富裕中农，有的在抗日斗争中是积极分子，有的是生产上的能手。我那些穷亲戚，一见面就赞扬党的政策。那些富裕中农，一见面就发开了牢骚，他们对粮食统购统销政策不满，对农业合作社更不满，但他们不直接说，故意转个弯子，说上级的政策都好，就是让村干部办坏了。说干部打击他，他没法过了，有的要折变了东西去闯关东。
    我是农民出身的，在思想感情上和农民有联系。我看到那些人感情很冲动，把自己说得那样可怜，我在思想上就同情起来。怀疑某些干部的作风可能有毛病，在执行政策方面可能有偏差。后来我长期在乡下住下了，和群众一同劳动，一同生活。人家种地，我跟着撒种，人家扬场，我在上风里扫糠。出海晕船我也不怕，叫我去，我去。不叫我也去。我觉得只有不怕吃苦，才能锻炼自己，提高自己。日子长了，我和干部、和群众建立了密切的友谊。他们帮助了我，使我学习了许多东西，也使我识破了那些大发牢骚的人的面目。原来他们已经发展成剥削者，有的放高利贷，有的搞粮食投机，他们千方百计地破坏社会主义建设，还故意寻找借口攻击干部和贫农。
    几年的基层工作，锻炼了我。我是党的干部，我要经常地学习党的政策指示，这样也提高了我的思想，纠正了我的错误，使我认识到农村两条道路的斗争是激烈复杂的，虽然表现形式不同，仔细分析起来，无不带有阶级烙印。开头我为什么同情那些富裕农民？从客观上说是我开头不了解情况，但主观上却是看问题的观点不对头，这反映了在我的头脑中还有非无产阶级的思想。事实教育了我，我认识到得努力加强政治理论学习，彻底改造思想，只有用无产阶级的立场观点看问题，才能识破资本主义自发势力的真相，同时只有亲身参加劳动和斗争，才能使我体会到党的领导的伟大，才能体会到那些英雄人物的可爱可亲。
    我不脱离生活，我就能及时地写一些配合当前工作的小说。“海上渔家”所以能够写成，主要是因为执行了毛主席的指示，到群众中去，亲自参加实际工作，经过长期的斗争和积累的结果。但我系统地学习马克思列宁主义理论著作不够，党性和纪律性锻炼不严格。因此思想仍落后于形势，反映到作品上，对英雄人物的共产主义风格写得不足，党的领导写得也不够好。从经验中使我认识到加强政治学习，努力改造思想的重要性，使我认识到没有无产阶级的世界观，就不可能正确地反映劳动人民的革命斗争。同时，如果不亲自参加人民群众的革命斗争，也就不能真正地理解劳动人民的思想感情，不能理解他们那种冲天干劲，和因公忘私的共产主义思想。
