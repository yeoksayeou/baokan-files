Display Great Ambition and Achieve a New Leap Forward
Low Yields Catch Up with High Yields, Backward Areas Catch Up with Advanced Areas
Xuzhou Prefecture Widely Establishes High-Yield Bases to Catch Up with Jiangnan, and Jin Southeast Launches a Production Competition of Plains Catching Up with Mountainous Areas
Cang County Transforms Alkaline Land to Eliminate Low-Yield Wheat Fields, Qiaobian Commune in Yichang Vigorously Launches a "Five Catch Up" Campaign to Increase Production

Nanjing, January 16th (by our newspaper) A new situation of "one early (early start, doing spring work in winter), two big (socialist large-scale production method), and three high (high standards)" has emerged in the winter production movement in Xuzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province. From cadres to the masses, everyone has made great ambitions: "To catch up with the high yields of Jiangnan, just look at the spring in Huaibei."

Xuzhou Prefecture, north of the Huai River, is a prefecture with a large cultivated area in Jiangsu Province. Based on the characteristics of a large area of overwintering crops and many spring-sown crops, the Xuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China timely proposed the requirements of "seizing the opportunity, striving for initiative, doing spring work in winter" and actively organized deep plowing and land preparation. Currently, more than 2 million mu of spring corn, spring sweet potatoes, and spring cotton fields in the entire prefecture have been deeply plowed and prepared according to the specifications of spring sowing, with wide ridges and furrows everywhere.

This year, in the spring sowing layout, Xuzhou Prefecture adapted to the characteristics of the people's commune being large and public, taking "large" as the key link, and using the method of socialist large-scale production to lead production. The layout of spring-sown crops implemented regionalization and adaptation to local conditions, with "transformation" as the priority. Efforts were made to ensure that large areas of crops were grown in contiguous plots, with corn, soybeans, and sweet potatoes planted in plains and ridges; rice was planted in low-lying areas, and oil crops and cotton were planted on sandy high ground, and high-yield grain production bases were established by selecting places with good soil.

In winter production, the characteristic of the leadership methods of the prefecture, county, and commune party committees is to ensure that important fronts remain stable during the shock campaign (such as water conservancy), while other fronts combine specialized management with mass shock campaigns to seize time, set priorities, and organize movements, achieving "attacking this, preparing for that, attacking one, consolidating one, not doing it is fine, but if you do it, do it thoroughly." This allows for seizing the opportunity, making achievements, and better promoting the next movement, so that work strives for initiative, the enthusiasm of the masses grows, and the production movement can develop wave upon wave.

Taiyuan, January 16th (by our newspaper) Jin Southeast District of Shanxi Province is launching a production competition of "turning the pot bottom up" where low-yield areas catch up with high-yield areas, and flat land catches up with mountainous land.

The Lu'an and Zezhou basins in Jin Southeast District have a total cultivated area of 2.73 million mu (including small flat areas), accounting for 37.8% of the total area of grain crops in the district. In recent years, the unit area yield of grain fields in various regions of the district has greatly increased, but in terms of the rate of increase, mountainous areas have increased faster and flat areas have increased slower, with mountainous areas having higher yields and flat areas having lower yields. In order to promote the rapid development of agricultural production in the entire district, the Jin Southeast District Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed grain production increase targets for low-yield areas; at the same time, it called on farmers in the plains areas of the district to exert greater revolutionary effort, summarize and promote the high-yield experience of low-yield areas, and actively find ways to change the face of low yields. According to the call of the district committee, the broad masses of commune members in the plains areas have launched a "turning the pot bottom up" competition of plains catching up with mountains, centered on vigorously engaging in tool reform, large-scale agricultural capital construction, and accumulating and transporting manure. According to statistics from various communes in Changzhi City alone, there are more than 4,000 people in specialized teams engaged in tool reform, and 1.01 million tools have been reformed, and more than 65,000 pieces of various new farm tools have been promoted. These tools increased efficiency by 1 to 83 times, equivalent to adding 140,000 labor workdays. At the same time, more than 600,000 people in the district have been invested in water conservancy capital construction, and 19,240 water conservancy and soil conservation projects have been started or newly started, and the large-scale manure accumulation movement has also achieved significant results.

The county and commune party committees in Jin Southeast attach great importance to the leadership of the "turning the pot bottom up" competition, and regard it as a major measure for the continued great leap forward in agriculture in 1960. Therefore, the county and commune have mobilized the entire party and all the people. The county party committee and commune party committee have respectively determined high-yield areas and high-yield squares, and sit in command by district, achieving that every square has a commander and every area has a pioneer, and according to the size of the task, the county party secretary, county party minister, and commune party secretary take the lead, and specifically determine the responsibility system by area. And systematically carry out opponent competitions, organize large-scale evaluations, large-scale summaries, and large-scale promotions, and carry out labor competitions between regions and regions, communes and communes, areas and areas, and squares and squares, with the Lu and Ze basins as the center.

According to Hebei Daily news, the 250,000 mu of alkaline land wheat in Cang County, Hebei Province, has been cultivated, alkali removed, and then universally watered with alkali-suppressing water, replaced with red soil, covered with sand, and topdressed with grass fertilizer, so that the number of effective plants per mu has caught up with that of ordinary wheat fields, laying a good foundation for eliminating low-yield wheat fields.

Cang County has a large area of saline-alkali land. Grasping the management of alkaline land wheat is of decisive significance for winning a bumper harvest of wheat in 1960. The Cang County Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed the characteristics of alkaline land wheat fields: the alkali return in winter is relatively light, and there are few dead seedlings; the alkali return in spring is relatively heavy, and there are the most dead seedlings. It was believed that it was necessary to take the initiative to eliminate alkali damage head-on. Therefore, it issued a battle call to the people of the county: "Work hard before the greening, eliminate low-yield fields, manage alkaline land wheat well, and seize high yields in every plot." And it focused on summarizing the high-yield experience of alkaline land wheat fields in Liu Pangzhuang Production Team of Zhifangtou Commune, arousing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and commune members. Then each commune and team made specific plans to strengthen the management of alkaline land wheat fields. The labor force invested in the management of alkaline land wheat in the county quickly increased from more than 23,000 people to more than 36,000 people.

After the overwintering management of alkaline land wheat seedlings was carried out vigorously, the communes and teams caught up with each other, joined hands, and made good achievements. During the winter irrigation period, six communes including Dongguan and Xingji jointly excavated more than 400 ditches and supported each other with more than 1,000 pieces of water conservancy tools, and have successfully completed the winter irrigation task of alkaline land wheat fields. Immediately afterwards, each commune and team launched a joint competition with the content of "sweeping alkali soil, replacing red soil, topdressing grass fertilizer, shallow cultivation, and building alkali ridges." In addition, by vigorously commending advanced units and advanced individuals, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and commune members has been further stimulated, making the wheat overproduction joint competition deepen step by step and achieve the victory of the number of effective plants in alkaline land wheat fields catching up with that of ordinary wheat fields.

Wuhan, January 16th (by our newspaper) Qiaobian People's Commune in Yichang County, Hubei Province, launched a "five catch up" balanced production increase movement in the field management of winter crops, where newly reclaimed fields catch up with old fields, sloping fields catch up with flat fields, large areas catch up with experimental fields, second- and third-class seedlings catch up with first-class seedlings, and miscellaneous grains catch up with staple grains. According to recent inspection results: the original more than 16,000 mu of third-class seedlings has increased from an average of 120,000 plants per mu to about 380,000 plants; the original first-class seedlings have also had new development, with an average of more than 420,000 plants per mu.

The content of the "five catch up" movement in Qiaobian Commune was put forward from the current production reality. In a large-scale field management inspection at the end of December last year, it was found that crop growth was very unbalanced, and most of the backward seedlings were distributed in newly reclaimed fields, sloping fields, and miscellaneous grains. The reasons for the backwardness: on the one hand, the newly reclaimed fields and sloping fields had a weak foundation, were far away, and were inconvenient to operate, so less fertilizer was applied and the seedlings were thin, and the tillering rate was very low. The commune party committee put forward the requirements of "five catch up" in the spirit of bumper harvests every season and bumper harvests of everything, and mobilized the masses to launch the "five catch up" movement.

In the "five catch up" movement, they also fully used the experience of vigorously engaging in experimental fields, and leaders at all levels went deep into the backward newly reclaimed fields, sloping fields, distant fields, and miscellaneous grain fields, contracted tasks, and attacked backward areas, with remarkable results. Comrade Yan Shengdai, secretary of the commune party committee, went deep into the Caojiabao management area, where there were the most backward seedlings, first mobilized the masses, and then worked with the cadres to contract tasks and go to the fields, and it took only two days to attack more than 2,500 mu of sloping fields and distant fields with topdressing. After promoting this leadership experience, more than 1,200 cadres and more than 3,000 activists in the entire commune set up more than 5,400 mu of upgraded experimental fields for backward seedlings, which greatly promoted the rapid development of the "five catch up" movement.

    拿出雄心大志　实现新的跃进
    低产赶高产　落后追先进
    徐州专区遍建高产基地赶江南晋东南开展平川赶山区生产竞赛
    沧县改造碱地消灭低产麦田宜昌桥边公社大搞“五赶”增产运动
    本报南京16日电　江苏省徐州专区冬季生产运动出现了“一早、（早动手，冬天就干春天活）、二大（社会主义大生产方式）、三高（高标准）”的新形势。从干部到群众都立下了雄心大志：“要赶江南高产，且看淮北春天”。
    淮河以北的徐州专区，是江苏省耕地面积较大的一个专区，根据越冬作物面积大和春播作物多的特点，中共徐州地委在“五冬”工作全面跃进的基础上，及时提出“抓时机，争主动，春天活，冬天干”的要求，积极组织深翻整地工作，目前全专区已有二百多万亩春玉米、春山芋、春棉花地按照春播的规格，做好深翻整地，处处是条垅宽畦。
    今年，徐州专区在春播布局上，适应人民公社一大二公的特点，以“大”为纲，运用社会主义大生产的方式领导生产，春播作物的布局，实行区域化、因地制宜，“改”（制）字当先。做到大面积作物成片成?，平原塄地种植玉米、大豆、山芋；洼地改种水稻，沙亢高地种植油料、棉花等经济作物，并且选择土质好的地方建立粮食高产基地。
    在冬季生产中，地、县、公社党委领导方法的特点是在突击运动中，做到重要的战线不动（如水利），其他战线是专业专管与群众性突击运动相结合，抢时间，定重点，组织运动，做到“突击这个，准备那个，突击一个，巩固一个，不搞则已，一搞就搞深搞透”。这样就能抓紧时机，做出成绩，更好地推动下一个运动。使得工作争取主动，群众干劲越来越大，生产运动就能一浪高一浪地向前发展。
    本报太原16日电　山西省晋东南区正在开展低产赶高产，平地赶山地的“翻锅底”的生产竞赛。
    晋东南区的潞（安）、泽（州）盆地，共计耕地面积二百七十三万亩（包括小块平地），占全区粮田作物总面积的37．8％。几年以来，全区各类地区的粮田单位面积产量都有很大提高，但从增产速度来看，却是山地增产快、平地增产慢，山地产量高、平地产量低。为了促进全区农业生产的迅速发展，中共晋东南地委对低产区提出粮食增产目标；同时号召全区平川地区的农民，鼓更大的革命干劲，总结、推广低产区的高产经验，积极地千方百计地改变低产面貌。根据地委的号召，平川区广大社员掀起了一个以大闹工具改革、大搞农业基本建设和积肥运肥为中心的川赶山的“翻锅底”竞赛。仅据长治市各公社统计，投入工具改革的专业队伍就有四千多人，已经改革了一百零一万件工具，推广了各种新式农具六万五千多件。这些工具提高效率达一至八十三倍，等于增加了十四万个劳动工日。同时，全区已有六十多万人投入了水利基本建设，动工和新开工的水利和水土保持工程达一万九千二百四十项，声势浩大的积肥运动也获得了显著效果。
    晋东南各县、公社党委十分重视“翻锅底”竞赛的领导，把它当作1960年农业继续大跃进的主要措施。因此，县、公社都实行全党动员、全民发动。县委、公社党委分别确定了丰产片、丰产方，分片坐阵指挥，达到方方有司令，片片有先行，根据任务大小，由县委书记、县委部长、公社党委书记挂帅，分片具体确定责任制。并且有计划地开展对手赛、组织大评比，大总结，大推广，以潞、泽盆地为中心，开展地区与地区、公社与公社、片与片、方与方之间的劳动竞赛。
    据河北日报消息　河北省沧县的二十五万亩碱地小麦，中耕、扫碱后又普浇了压碱水，换了红土，盖了沙子，追施了草肥，使每亩的有效株数赶上了一般麦田，为消灭低产麦田打下了良好基础。
    沧县盐碱地面积很大，狠抓碱地小麦管理，对夺取1960年小麦大丰收有决定性的意义。中共沧县县委分析了碱地麦田的特点是，冬季返碱较轻，死苗少；入春返碱较重，死苗最多。认为必须主动迎头消灭碱害。于是向全县人民发出了“大干返青前，消灭低产田，管好碱地麦，块块夺高产”的战斗号召。并重点总结了纸房头公社刘胖庄生产队碱地麦田高产的经验，鼓起广大干部社员的革命干劲。接着各社、队都作出了加强碱地麦田管理的具体计划。全县投入碱地小麦管理的劳动力由两万三千多人，很快增加到三万六千多人。
    碱地麦苗的越冬管理工作蓬蓬勃勃开展起来以后，社与社、队与队，你追我赶，携手前进，获得了良好的成绩。在冬灌期间，东关、兴济等六个公社，协作开挖了沟渠四百多条，互相支援水利工具一千多件，已经胜利地完成了碱地麦田的冬灌任务。紧接着各社、队又展开了以“扫碱土、换红土、追草肥、浅中耕、培碱埂”为内容的携手竞赛。此外，通过大张旗鼓地表扬先进单位和先进人物，进一步激发了广大干部社员的积极性，使得小麦超产携手赛步步深入，取得了碱地麦田有效株数赶上一般麦田的胜利。
    本报武汉16日电　湖北省宜昌县桥边人民公社在冬季作物的田间管理上，开展新垦田赶老田、坡田赶平田、大面积赶试验田、二三类苗赶一类苗、杂粮赶主粮的“五赶”平衡增产运动。据最近检查结果：原来的一万六千多亩三类苗，已由每亩平均十二万株增加到三十八万株左右；原来的一类苗也有了新的发展，每亩平均都在四十二万株以上。
    桥边公社“五赶”运动的内容是从当前的生产实际中提出来的。在去年12月底的一次田间管理大检查中，发现作物生长很不平衡，而且大部落后苗是分布在新垦田、坡田和杂粮中。造成落后的原因：一方面是由于新垦田、坡田的底子薄、距离远、操作不方便，因而下肥少苗子瘦，分蘖率很低。公社党委根据季季丰收，样样丰收的精神，提出了“五赶”的要求，发动群众，开展了“五赶”运动。
    在“五赶”运动中，他们还充分地运用了大搞试验田的经验，层层领导干部纷纷深入到落后的新垦田、坡田、远田和杂粮田，分工包干，突击落后，效果显著。公社党委书记阎圣代同志，深入到落后苗最多的曹家畈管理区，先发动群众，然后和干部一道分工下田，只用两天时间就突击了二千五百多亩坡田和远田的追肥。推广这一领导经验以后，全社有一千二百多干部和三千多积极分子，办起了五千四百多亩落后苗的升级试验田，大大地推动了“五赶”运动的迅速发展。（附图片）
