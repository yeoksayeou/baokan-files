    Paris dispatch: With the development of trade wars between imperialist countries, American capital is pouring into France on a large scale.

    "Les Echos," representing the interests of French industrial and financial capital, recently published an article by Verne stating that DuPont, the largest chemical company in the United States, has many agreements with French companies. After signing an agreement with the French "Rhône-Poulenc" group, it established Nemours DuPont in France. Parsons Aircraft Company, which monopolizes the production of American helicopter propellers, established European Parsons Aircraft Company in France with a capital of 100 million francs. Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company, an American aircraft engine manufacturer, participated in the French state-owned aircraft engine research and manufacturing company. According to "Les Echos," the American Firestone Tire & Rubber Company is preparing to establish an industrial conglomerate in France including a synthetic rubber factory and a tire factory, with an investment of several million dollars.

    In the French food business and department store industry, there is also a large amount of American investment. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, one of the four major American food companies, has opened 22 self-service food stores in the Paris area alone, with a total capital of 5 billion francs. Corn Products Company, a subsidiary of American Corn Products Refining Company, acquired the French company Innek. After acquiring this French company, Corn Products Company's capital increased from 1.31 billion francs to more than 3.3 billion francs. "Les Echos" pointed out that the reason for the recent large-scale influx of American monopoly capital into France is that "France's productivity is very high," with some factories being 21% higher than in the United States, so American companies can obtain greater profits. At the same time, the demand in the French market is also greater than in the United States, and establishing factories locally can enhance the competitiveness of American companies in the French market and "penetrate the franc zone countries."

    美国资本大规模打进法国
  本报讯　巴黎消息：随着帝国主义国家贸易战的发展，美国资本正大规模地涌入法国。
    代表法国工业和金融资本利益的“回声报”，不久以前刊载凡尔纳写的一篇文章中说，杜邦公司是美国最大的化学公司，它同法国公司订立有许多协定。它同法国“河萨克”集团订立协定之后，就在法国建立了涅摩尔杜邦公司。垄断美国直升飞机螺旋桨生产的帕森斯飞机公司，在法国建立了一个拥有资本一亿法郎的欧洲帕森斯飞机公司。美国的飞机发动机制造公司普拉特—怀特奈飞机公司，参加了法国国营飞机发动机研究制造公司。据“回声报”说，美国费尔斯通轮胎橡胶公司正筹备在法国建立一个包括合成橡胶工厂和轮胎工厂的工业联合企业，投资将达几百万美元。
    在法国食品商业和百货业方面，美国也有大量投资。美国四大食品公司之一的大光明联合公司，仅在巴黎地区就开设了二十二个自助服务食品店，资本总额达五十亿法郎。美国谷物加工公司的分公司——玉米产品公司收买了法国英恩克子公司。在收买这一法国公司后，玉米产品公司的资本从十三亿一千万法郎增加到三十三亿多法郎。“回声报”指出，美国垄断资本最近大规模流入法国的原因，是“法国的生产率很高”，有的工厂要比美国高21％，这样美国公司可得到更大利润。同时，法国市场的需求也比美国大，就地开设工厂，可以增强美国公司在法国市场的竞争能力，“打入法郎区国家”。
