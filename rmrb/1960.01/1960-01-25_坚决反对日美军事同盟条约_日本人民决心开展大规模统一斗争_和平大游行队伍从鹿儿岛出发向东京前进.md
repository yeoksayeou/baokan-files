Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 24th. The National Council Against Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in Japan issued a statement today announcing that after Nobusuke Kishi returns home, it will strengthen its struggle and strive to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

The statement strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for disregarding the fact that the broad masses of people had launched eleven unified actions to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty," and for ignoring the desire of the majority of the people for Japan to adopt a policy of peace and neutrality, and for signing a military alliance treaty with the United States. The statement said that we do not recognize this treaty signed by Nobusuke Kishi.

The statement stated that the National Council will immediately organize protest struggles: In February, a national march to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" will be held in various prefectures across the country; when the Diet begins to deliberate on this treaty, large-scale protest rallies will be held simultaneously across the country; and it is prepared to launch a large-scale unified action centered on workers' strikes to prevent the Diet from ratifying this treaty.

The statement was issued at a press conference held by the National Council today. Those present at the reception included Hirozo Minakuchi, Secretary-General of the National Council, Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, Fumio Ogasawara, Central Executive Committee member of the Socialist Party, Mio Yanagimoto, Director of the Political Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, as well as representatives of the All-Japan Farmers Association Federation and the Japan Women's Association for the Protection of National Human Rights.

Hirozo Minakuchi said at the meeting that while holding the national march, the National Council will launch a signature campaign to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," a fundraising campaign, hold speech rallies, and also launch a campaign to write letters to friends and relatives, calling for opposition to the ratification of this treaty.

Sanzo Nosaka pointed out that more and more people are opposing the new "Security Treaty." He said that the Japanese Communist Party will focus on exposing the essence of this treaty to the broad masses of the people, and strive to strengthen and expand the joint struggle organization against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Fumio Ogasawara said that the Socialist Party will expose the essence of this treaty in the Diet and call on public opinion to oppose the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." He said that on this basis, the Socialist Party will demand the dissolution of the Diet and hold a general election.

Mio Yanagimoto said that "Sohyo" is prepared to launch a strike by workers at the important juncture when the Diet is deliberating on the new "Security Treaty" and resolutely launch a struggle.

Representatives of the All-Japan Farmers Association Federation and the Japan Women's Association for the Protection of National Human Rights also stated that they will strengthen the struggles of farmers and women and strive to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 24th. The Japan National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations issued a statement on the 23rd, announcing that it does not recognize the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" signed by Nobusuke Kishi with the United States, because this treaty will involve Japan more deeply in a military alliance that is hostile to China.

The statement said that the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations will launch a large-scale national movement to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new "Security Treaty" and establish normal diplomatic relations with China.

The statement pointed out that the signing of the treaty means that Japan openly regards China and the Soviet Union as potential enemies of Japan, which shows that Japan wants to exacerbate the tense situation in the Far East.

The statement also pointed out that the signing of this treaty proves that the Kishi Nobusuke government is subordinate to U.S. imperialism, proving that Japan is willing to act as a junior partner of the United States, and that it has malicious intentions to invade other Asian countries.

The statement also pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi does not represent the will of the Japanese people. The statement emphasized that he and his gang have exposed themselves as a dirty group eager to sell out national interests to the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 24th. On the day that Nobusuke Kishi returned to Japan from the United States, the National Council Against Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" dispatched thirteen cars to parade on the streets of Tokyo, calling on citizens to fight to protest against the Kishi Nobusuke government's signing of the new "Security Treaty" and to prevent the Diet from ratifying this treaty.

These cars were hung with huge banners with the words: "Oppose the ratification of the new Security Treaty that runs counter to peace and disarmament!" Wu Gui Dongwu, a representative of the Japanese Communist Party, shouted through a loudspeaker on the car: "Yankees get out of Japan!" "Kishi Nobusuke, don't come back to Japan!"

Many representatives also called for striving to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations by preventing the ratification of this treaty.

The cars dispatched by the National Council also distributed leaflets to citizens. The leaflets were printed with black mourning symbols expressing the grief and anger of the Japanese people. The leaflet read: If the new "Security Treaty" is allowed to be ratified in the Diet, the United States will occupy Japan for a long time, openly arm Japan with nuclear weapons, Japan will be involved in war preparations against China and the Soviet Union, and a conscription system will be implemented, and the people's lives and rights will be further oppressed and deprived.

The leaflet emphasized that there is only one path for Japan to take, and that is the path of peace, independence, and neutrality.

Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, issued a statement this afternoon on Nobusuke Kishi's return to China, saying that the Socialist Party will thoroughly criticize the dangerous new treaty that will lead to war, lead to the revision of the constitution, and the implementation of the conscription system.

The Japan Democratic Socialist Party also issued a statement today, condemning Nobusuke Kishi for signing the new "Security Treaty" despite the opposition of the people. The statement also stated that the first task of the Democratic Socialist Party is to prevent the ratification of this new "Security Treaty," and that it must use great determination to dissolve the House of Representatives so as to solicit the will of the people to see whether the people approve of this treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 24th. The Japanese People's Peace March set off from Kagoshima City in southern Japan today and marched towards Tokyo. The purpose of the march is to demand that the United States return Okinawa to Japan and to oppose Japan's implementation of nuclear armaments.

This march, which has a total distance of 2,500 kilometers, was initiated by the Japan Peace Committee and the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

This march will be relayed by people from various prefectures in Japan, and is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo in early April. On the way, the Peace March team will converge with the Japan General Council of Trade Unions' march against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    声明强烈谴责岸信介政府不顾广大人民展开十一次统一行动来反对修改“安全条约”的事实，并忽视大部分人民渴望日本采取和平中立政策的意愿，同美国签订了军事同盟条约。声明说，我们不承认岸信介所签订的这项条约。
