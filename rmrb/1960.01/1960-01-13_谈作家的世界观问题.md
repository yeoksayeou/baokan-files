It is evident to all that our writers and artists have created many excellent literary and artistic works for the people in these short ten years. Especially in the past two years or so, there has been an abundance of good books, good plays, good movies, good paintings, good songs, and good dances. Our writers and artists have not disappointed the earnest expectations of the Party and the people. They have made great efforts to meet the broad masses of people's demands for literary and artistic appreciation and have enriched our socialist literary and artistic treasury. Recalling the achievements of this past period is something to be proud of, but our writers and artists are not complacent because of this. To better fulfill the tasks given to them by the Party and the people, they are working even harder to create more and better works for the people and to win glory for the country's literature and art.

However, despite this, the people still have higher demands for writers and artists. Due to the great victories of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, life in China is seething with activity. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, 650 million people are forging ahead on a new path, full steam ahead. While people are going all out to carry out the great cause of socialist construction, they are also looking forward to the inspiring communist future, transforming nature, transforming society, and transforming their own thinking to realize the lofty ideals of mankind. Communist factors have already emerged in the process of socialist construction. The ideas of continuous revolution and communism in the minds of the people are by no means rare. Reflecting the growth of these communist factors and helping the people cultivate communist ideological qualities has become the urgent demand of the people for current literary and artistic creation and the primary task for writers and artists. However, not all writers and artists are ideologically prepared to complete this task. Some works reveal that writers and artists are lagging behind the development of reality in their thinking, and some can even be said to be contrary to the development of the great reality.

Two novels attached to the twenty-fourth issue of "Honeybee" published in 1959 are works that do not conform to the spirit of the times and distort reality. Comrade Liu Zhen's "Heroic Rhapsody" regards the issues of revolutionary war and love from the perspective of bourgeois humanitarianism, portraying the heroic revolutionary war in such a bleak light. The author sets personal happiness against the revolutionary cause. The characters praised by the author have bourgeois decadent and declining emotions. Comrade Du He's "Cao Jinlan" describes, praises, and makes demands on party member cadres and activists in the people's commune from the standpoint and viewpoint of a well-to-do middle peasant. He praises a female communist party member who abandoned the principle of struggle as "seeing such rare qualities in her." It can be said that some individual writers have bodies that have already entered socialist society, but their minds are still left in the new democratic society or the feudal society. What he comes into contact with are people with communist style, but his ideal is still "thirty acres of land, a cow, a wife, and children on a warm bed." In the works, there is a lingering attachment to the small-scale peasant economy and individual production methods. He cannot see the factory chimneys erected in the countryside but is still admiring "small bridges, flowing water, and houses." In terms of creative methods, he seems to agree with the slogan of combining revolutionary realism with revolutionary romanticism, but in creative practice, he is a crawling naturalist who distorts reality. It is obvious that if the writer himself does not have the ambition and enthusiasm to build socialism and communism, it is impossible to produce revolutionary romanticism and impossible to correctly reflect reality.

The erroneous creative ideas of some writers should not be easily and indiscriminately regarded as revisionist literary and artistic ideas. Some comrades have been loyal to the Party for a long time and have been diligently engaged in creation, with the aim of serving the people. But because their worldview has not been thoroughly transformed, they have fallen behind on the road of socialist transformation and socialist construction, and the speed of ideological progress has not kept up with the needs of realistic development. Then, as long as they are criticized, reminded to work hard to catch up, that will be enough. However, transforming the worldview is not an easy task, so some writers refuse criticism, defend their mistakes, insist on their wrong views, and promote their own ideas, then we must shout loudly to him. Moreover, we believe that although we should not oppose all shortcomings and errors as revisionist literary and artistic ideas, we can improve our ideological level and solve the problems of erroneous and backward literary and artistic ideas by opposing revisionist literary and artistic ideas. Only in this way can the hotbed and market of revisionist literary and artistic ideas be completely eliminated. To solve these problems, whether it is revisionist literary and artistic ideas or problems of backward understanding, in the final analysis, the writer's worldview must be thoroughly transformed to completely solve the fundamental problems of creative thinking. Without transforming the old worldview, it is impossible to have a correct understanding of the new world, and it is impossible to get a correct reflection in the works. If you insist on creating, then you will inevitably describe subjective consciousness as objective existence, treat the reality of socialist construction with a bourgeois individualistic worldview, and it is impossible to shape noble characters with communist style. Because he uses the heart of bourgeois individualism to measure the belly of communist heroes, and the two have no common ground.

Some writers feel that it is difficult to express new things, thinking that characters with communist ideas are not easy to shape, so they want to take a "light" path and plan to write themes from the period of the democratic revolution. In fact, if the worldview is not transformed, any theme cannot be expressed well. Comrade Fang Ji's mistakes in some novel creations should arouse our vigilance. Comrade Fang Ji's subjective intention in works such as "The Visitor" may have been to criticize these capitalists, landlords, and bourgeois intellectuals on the one hand, and point out a way out for them, but as a result, although it seems that they were smeared with a little bit of ash on their noses, in fact, they were improperly praised, forming a distortion of the new society, which led to readers' criticism. The reason is probably that in the author's mind, the status of landlords, capitalists, and bourgeois intellectuals is too large, while the status of the working class and the peasant class is too small. It seems that what the author cares about most is not the fate of the workers and peasants, but the fate of those who are being transformed. In this way, a counter-attack description was made, so that it failed to grow the ambition of the proletariat, but instead promoted sympathy and praise for those who were being transformed. It can be seen that the writer's worldview determines what kind of themes the writer chooses and how to express these themes. The error of the worldview leads to the writer's erroneous view of everything. Therefore, we have reason to demand that in an era filled with communist spirit, our writers, whether writing works on realistic or historical themes, should resolutely and thoroughly transform their worldview.

With the continuous growth of communist factors and the rapid improvement of the ideological awareness level of the masses, readers have higher requirements for works describing revolutionary historical themes. They require writers to reflect the development of our revolutionary history and the spiritual outlook of revolutionary heroes from the height of communist thought. If the writer's worldview does not keep up with the needs of continuous revolution, even if he creates works with revolutionary historical themes, he cannot meet the requirements of readers. If you still want to use the standards of past works as a model for describing the themes of the democratic revolution today, it will be a big mistake to reverse the ideology. What's more, some of our writers want to write historical themes, not because writing those historical themes is helpful to the current struggle, but to "use them as a small decoration in history." This is a serious manifestation of being divorced from the masses and divorced from the current actual struggle, indicating the decline of the writer's revolutionary will. There is such a writer who even said, "I have no great ambitions in my life, I wish to be a bookworm," "Two rooms and a book are enough." It is hard to believe that with such stale ideas and the dark emotions of the declining class, he can write works that are needed by today's high-spirited readers. It seems that the idea of "revolution to the end" must first be cleared from the minds of such writers, and their worldview can be well transformed. The people do not allow them to infect readers with that kind of sentimental and complacent mood, to dissipate the high fighting spirit of the heroic masses of socialist construction.

We believe that today, whether it is writers, artists, critics, or literary and art organization workers, in order to adapt to the requirements of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, in order to better meet the people's increasing appreciation level of literature and art, in order to make literature and art can help improve the people's communist ideological awareness and moral character, it is very necessary to rapidly launch a movement to study Chairman Mao's works in the literary and art circles and thoroughly transform their own worldview.

However, transforming the worldview is a long-term work of completely changing the position and transforming the mind. It is a complex and arduous task. It must be carried out actively and prevent acute illnesses, prevent extremism and easily negate achievements. In conducting criticism and self-criticism, we must prevent simplicity, rudeness, and impatience, so as not to be detrimental to unity and the development of literary and artistic undertakings. For the criticism of works and literary and art theories, we should implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend in order to break well, establish well, and enable both sides of the debate to be educated. We believe that the transformation of the worldview of writers and artists and the unfolding of the mass literary and artistic creation movement will enable our literature and art to achieve new development and new prosperity and climb to new peaks.

    谈作家的世界观问题
    远千里
    谁都看得见，我们的作家艺术家在这短短的十年里，为人民创作了许多优秀的文艺作品。特别是最近两年多来，好书、好戏、好电影、好画、好歌、好舞等，看也看不了，听也听不完。我们的作家艺术家没有辜负党和人民对他们的殷切期望，他们尽了极大的努力，来满足广大人民对文艺欣赏的要求，并且丰富了我们的社会主义的文艺宝库。回忆过去这一段工作成绩，是足以自豪的，但我们的作家艺术家并未因此而自满。为了更好地完成党和人民给他们的任务，他们正在更加努力地为人民创作更多更好的作品，为祖国的文学艺术争光。
    但是，尽管如此，人民对于作家艺术家也还是要提出更高的要求。由于总路线、大跃进和人民公社的伟大的胜利，全中国的生活在沸腾着，六亿五千万人民在共产党和毛主席的领导下，踏着一条崭新的道路，开足了马力，浩浩荡荡地向前飞奔。人们一面鼓足干劲地干着当前的伟大的社会主义建设事业，一面又望着令人向往的共产主义前景，为实现人类的崇高理想而改造着自然，改造着社会，也改造着自己的思想。在社会主义建设过程中已经出现着共产主义的因素，在人民的思想中，不断革命的思想、共产主义的思想也决不是什么稀罕的事，而反映这种共产主义因素的成长和帮助人民培养共产主义的思想品质，就成为人民对当前文艺创作的迫切要求，成为作家艺术家当前的首要任务。但是，并不是所有的作家艺术家对于完成这个任务，都有足够的思想准备。有的作品暴露出作家艺术家在思想上还赶不上现实的发展，有的简直可以说，和伟大现实的发展相违背。
    在1959年出版的第二十四期“蜜蜂”上附发的两篇小说，就是与时代精神不合、歪曲现实的作品。刘真同志的“英雄的乐章”，是以资产阶级人道主义观点，来看待革命战争和爱情问题，把壮烈的革命战争，写得那样暗淡。作者把个人幸福和革命事业对立起来。作者所歌颂的人物有着资产阶级的颓废没落的情绪。杜河同志的“曹金兰”，则是以富裕中农的立场、观点来描写、赞美和要求人民公社里的党员干部和积极分子的。他把一个放弃原则斗争的女共产党员，誉之为“从她身上看到多么罕见的品质”。可以说，我们的确有个别的作家，他的身子虽已进入社会主义社会，可是他的脑袋却还留在新民主主义社会或者封建制度的社会里。他所接触的是具有共产主义风格的人们，而他的理想却仍然是“三十亩地一头牛，老婆孩子热炕头。”在作品里流露着对小农经济、个体生产方式的依恋。他看不见农村里树立起的工厂的烟囱，却依然在欣赏“小桥、流水、人家”。在创作方法上，他仿佛也赞成革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的口号，但在创作实践上却是歪曲现实的爬行的自然主义者。这是明显的，如果作家本人没有建设社会主义、共产主义的抱负和热情，是不可能产生革命的浪漫主义精神，不可能正确地反映现实的。
    对于有些作家的错误创作思想，不应该轻易地、不加区别地都看做是修正主义文艺思想。有些同志长期以来对党忠诚、勤勤恳恳地进行着创作，目的是为人民服务。但是因为他们的世界观还没有得到彻底的改造，以致在社会主义改造和社会主义建设的道路上落了伍，思想进步的速度赶不上现实发展的需要，那么只要一批评，提醒他努力跟上也就可以了。不过改造世界观并不是一件很容易的事，因而有的作家就拒绝批评，为自己的错误进行辩护，坚持自己的错误观点，宣传自己的主张，那就必须对他大喝一声了。并且我们认为，虽然不应该把什么缺点和错误都当成修正主义文艺思想来加以反对，却可以通过反对修正主义文艺思想，来提高自己的思想水平，来解决有关错误和落后的文艺思想问题。也只有这样，才能彻底消灭修正主义文艺思想的温床和市场。而要想解决这些问题，则不管是修正主义文艺思想也好，认识落后问题也好，归根结底，必须彻底改造作家的世界观，才能彻底解决创作思想的根本问题。不改造旧的世界观，不可能对新的世界有正确的认识，在作品里也就不可能得到正确的反映。如果硬要进行创作，那么就必然会把主观意识当做客观存在来描写，用资产阶级个人主义世界观来对待社会主义建设的现实，不可能塑造出具有共产主义风格的高尚人物形象。因为他是以资产阶级个人主义之心，来度共产主义英雄之腹，两者是没有共同点的。
    有的作家感到表现新事物有困难，认为具有共产主义思想的人物不易塑造，便想走一条“轻便”的路，打算写民主主义革命时期的题材。其实，如果不改造世界观，任何题材也是表现不好的。方纪同志在一些小说创作中所犯的错误，应该引起我们的警惕。方纪同志在“来访者”等作品里，主观企图可能是想一方面批判这些资本家、地主和资产阶级知识分子们，并且给他们指出一条出路来，但其结果，虽然似乎也给他们在鼻子上抹了一点点灰，而实际上是对他们做了不正当的歌颂，形成对新社会的歪曲，以致遭到读者的责难。其原因恐怕是在作者的脑子里，地主、资本家、资产阶级知识分子所占的地位太大，而工人阶级、农民阶级所占的地位太小，好像作者所最关心的主要并不是工人、农民的命运，而倒是那些被改造阶级的命运。这样也就作了反宾为主的描写，因而未能长无产阶级的志气，反倒宣扬了对被改造者的同情和赞扬。可见作家的世界观决定了作家选择甚么样的题材，和怎样表现这些题材。世界观的错误导致作家对一切事物的看法有错误。因而我们有理由要求，在昂扬着共产主义精神的时代，我们的作家不管写现实题材或历史题材的作品，都应该坚决而彻底地改造自己的世界观。
    随着共产主义因素的不断增长和群众的思想觉悟水平的迅速提高，读者对描写革命历史题材的作品也有了更高的要求，他们要求作家从共产主义思想的高度来反映我们革命历史的发展，革命英雄人物的精神面貌。如果作家的世界观赶不上不断革命的需要，即使创作革命历史题材的作品，也不能满足读者的要求。如果还想以过去的作品标准，做为今天描写民主革命时期题材的范本，那将是思想上开倒车，大错而特错了。更何况，我们有的作家想写历史题材，目的并不是因为那些历史题材的写作有助于当前的斗争，而是为了“当做历史上的一点小摆设”。这是严重地脱离群众、脱离当前的实际斗争的表现，说明了作家的革命意志的衰退。有这样一位作家，竟说什么“平生无大志，愿做书虫子”，“两间房子一本书，足矣”。很难令人相信，以这样陈腐的思想，没落阶级的阴暗情绪，能够写出为今天意气风发的读者所需要的作品来。看来，必须首先把“革命到头论”的思想，从这样的作家头脑中清除出去，他们的世界观才能得到很好的改造。人民不允许他们用那种感伤的、苟安的情绪来感染读者，来涣散社会主义建设英雄群众的昂扬斗志。
    我们认为，在今天，不管是作家、艺术家、批评家、文艺组织工作者，为了适应总路线、大跃进的要求，为了更好地满足人民群众对文学艺术日益提高的欣赏水平，为了使文学艺术能够帮助提高人民群众的共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质，在文艺界迅速开展一个学习毛主席著作的运动，并彻底改造自己的世界观是非常必要的。
    但是，改造世界观是一个彻底改变立场、改造思想的长期的工作，是一个复杂而艰巨的任务，必须积极地进行而又防止犯急性病，防止偏激和轻易否定成绩。在进行批评和自我批评的时候要防止简单、粗暴、不耐心，以免不利于团结，不利于文艺事业的发展。而对于作品和文艺理论的批评，更应该贯彻执行百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，才能破得好，立得好，使争辩的双方都受到教益。我们相信：作家艺术家的世界观的改造，群众文艺创作运动的展开，将使我们的文学艺术得到新的发展、新的繁荣，攀登上新的高峰。
