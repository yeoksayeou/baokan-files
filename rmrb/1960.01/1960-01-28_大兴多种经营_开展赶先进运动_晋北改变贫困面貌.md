    Vigorous Development of Diversified Economy, Launching an Advanced Movement: Jinbei Changes Its Poor Face
    (Our Newspaper) Historically known for its low yields and poverty, the Jinbei region of Shanxi Province, following the Great Leap Forward in 1958, achieved continuous Great Leaps Forward in the first year of communization. In 1959, the total grain output of the entire region reached 3 billion jin, an increase of 15% compared to the bumper harvest of 1958, and one year's output was equal to the total output of the two years before liberation. Grain yield per unit area increased by 16% compared to 1958. More than 3,000 high-yield units emerged in the region, and two communes and 144 management districts achieved the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program of 400 jin of grain per mu, eight years ahead of schedule. Oil crops, cotton, vegetables, and forage also achieved bumper harvests. Crops such as rice and sugar beets have also developed from scratch and from small to large-scale. Animal husbandry, centered on pig raising, is thriving. The number of pigs in pens at the end of the year increased by 40% compared to the beginning of the year, and many "ten-thousand-pig communes," "thousand-pig districts," and "hundred-pig teams" emerged. Cattle, horses, and sheep are increasing in both quantity and quality. More than 3.64 million mu of trees were planted throughout the year, and most of the mountain tops and riverbanks were planted with trees. The region harvested more than 100 million jin of fruits. As a result of the comprehensive and vigorous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, the total agricultural value of the region in 1959 increased by 30% compared to 1958, and the income of commune members also increased significantly. The purchase of agricultural and sideline products reached a full success, and the grain purchase task was also overfulfilled ahead of schedule.
    In the process of changing the face of production in the Jinbei region, cadres and the masses widely established the ambitious goal of changing from poverty to wealth. People's communes in various places unified planning, comprehensive arrangements, mutual cooperation, and launched competitions. In the past year, they have shown great superiority in transforming nature. The area of irrigated land has been expanded to 7.7 million mu, and 2.5 million mu of cultivated land has reached the high standard of ensuring harvests regardless of drought or flood. The area controlling soil erosion is 21.25 million mu, accounting for 41.9% of the area that should be controlled; nearly 2,000 "Daquanshan" (big spring mountains) have been developed, and 2.17 million mu of saline-alkali land has been improved, making basic farmland basically realized water conservancy, terracing, and diking. In addition, windbreaks of 800 li from east to west, fruit tree belts of 200 li from north to south, and grape forests of 300 li along the Sanggan River were built. While transforming nature, the situation of utilizing nature has been opened up. 40% of the management districts in the region have realized the mechanization of milling using water, fire, wind, and electricity. Ninety-three rural hydropower stations have been built and are under construction, and 367 power stations have been built.
    The Jinbei area is sparsely populated and has a cold climate. In the past, cultivation was extensive, grain yields were very low, production was monotonous, and farmers had very little income. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the backward appearance has changed year by year. The realization of people's communes in 1958 greatly developed production, which further improved people's thinking and boosted their morale. People no longer say that the conditions in Jinbei are bad, but they are inspired with soaring enthusiasm and strive for exceeding targets, exceeding measures, exceeding quotas, high speed, high quality, and high income. The entire region has widely launched a competition in which poor teams are determined to catch up with rich teams, rich teams become even richer, learn from advanced teams, and help those in difficulty. Not only did the 2,155 relatively wealthy management districts in the entire region increase their average income by about 20% compared to 1958, but the original 2,825 poor management districts with an average income of less than 40 yuan per person have all caught up with and surpassed the relatively wealthy management districts in the area. A new look of common prosperity has emerged in the entire countryside.

    大兴多种经营　开展赶先进运动
    晋北改变贫困面貌
    本报讯　历史上以低产贫困著称的山西省晋北地区，继1958年大跃进之后，在公社化第一年又获得了连续大跃进。1959年全专区粮食总产量达到三十亿斤，比大丰收的1958年增长了15％，一年的产量等于解放前两年的产量总和。粮食单位产量比1958年增长16％，全区出现高额丰产单位三千多个，并有两个公社和一百四十四个管理区提前八年实现了农业发展纲要亩产四百斤粮食的指标。油料、棉花、蔬菜、饲草也都获得了大丰收。水稻、甜菜等作物，都从无到有、从少到多地发展起来。以养猪为中心的畜牧业十分兴旺，年底圈存猪比年初增长了40％，并出现了许多万猪社、千猪区、百猪队。牛、马、羊等都是数量、质量比翼双飞。全年植树三百六十四万多亩，大部分山头、河畔栽上了树。全区果品收获了一亿多斤。农林牧副渔全面大发展的结果，1959年全区农业总产值比1958年提高了30％，社员收入也大大增加。农副产品收购出现了满堂红，粮食征购任务也已提前超额完成。
    晋北地区改变生产面貌过程中，干部群众中广立由穷变富的雄心大志，各地人民公社统一规划、全面安排、互相协作、开展竞赛。一年来在改造自然方面显示了巨大的优越性。水浇地面积扩大到七百七十万亩，有二百五十万亩耕地达到了旱涝保丰收的高标准。控制水土流失面积两千一百二十五万亩，占应控制面积的41．9％；发展了近两千个“大泉山”，改良了二百一十七万亩盐碱地，使基本农田基本实现了水利化、梯田化、地埂化。另外，营造了东西八百里的防护林带，南北二百里的果树林带，以及沿桑干河三百里长的葡萄林。在改造自然的同时，打开了利用自然的局面。全区已有40％的管理区利用水、火、风、电实现了碾磨动力化，建成和正在兴建的农村水电站九十三处，动力站三百六十七处。
    晋北地区地广人稀，气候寒冷，过去耕作粗放，粮食产量很低，生产单一，农民收入很少。解放以后，在党的领导下，落后面貌逐年改观。1958年实现人民公社化，生产获得很大发展，这更加提高了人们的思想，鼓舞了人们的干劲。人们不再说晋北条件不好，而是鼓起冲天干劲，力争超指标、超措施、超定额、高速度、高质量、高收入。全区广泛开展了穷队立志赶富队，富队更加富裕，有先进就赶，见困难就帮的竞赛。不仅全专区两千一百五十五个比较富裕的管理区比1958年平均收入增长了20％左右，原来每人平均收入不到四十元的两千八百二十五个穷管理区，都赶上和超过了当地比较富裕的管理区。整个农村出现了共同富裕的新面貌。
