Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: Resolution of the People of All Circles in the Capital Opposing the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance

    On January 23, 1960, the people of all circles in the Chinese capital solemnly gathered to firmly oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance and fully endorse the statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 14 regarding opposition to the signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The Chinese people have always enthusiastically supported the Japanese people's struggle against the revision and for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and will continue to firmly support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. We extend our highest respect to the heroic Japanese people in their struggle.

    The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, disregarding the strong opposition of the Japanese people and the repeated warnings of the people of the world, signed the U.S.-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" in Washington on January 19 under the guise of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." U.S. imperialism, in order to plan new aggression and war, has torn up a series of international agreements concerning the prevention of the revival of Japanese militarism and the resurgence of Japanese aggression, openly reviving Japanese militarism, and incorporating Japan into the U.S. aggressive military bloc and atomic warfare system. The Japanese militarist forces, represented by Nobusuke Kishi, vainly attempt to rely on U.S. imperialism to once again expand in Asia, reliving the dream of the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The establishment of the U.S.-Japan military alliance seriously threatens the security of China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries, and plunges the Japanese nation once again into the abyss of war.

    In order to oppose the criminal acts of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, the Japanese people have launched a magnificent mass movement. The Chinese people and the Asian people, who have suffered deeply from the aggression of Japanese militarism, express great anger and strong opposition to the military collusion between the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. All peace-loving people around the world severely condemn U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarist elements.

    Faced with the powerful socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and the world's peace forces, U.S. imperialism has recently been forced to make some gestures of "willingness to ease international tensions," attempting to deceive the people under the smokescreen of "peace," buy time, accelerate the development of missile production, and prepare for nuclear war. But U.S. imperialism cannot hide its true colors. Not long ago, the U.S. government openly announced that it would resume nuclear weapons testing at any time and has already conducted a series of underground nuclear tests. While U.S. imperialism is stepping up the revival of West German Nazi forces in Europe, it is now brazenly concluding a military alliance with Japanese militarist forces, which further exposes its true face of "false peace, true war preparations."

    The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have concluded a military alliance in an attempt to extricate themselves from the difficulties and isolation caused by their policies of war and aggression. However, they are drinking poison to quench their thirst, suffering the increasingly fierce public outrage of the people of the world, and falling into a more difficult and isolated situation. Their intensified hostility towards China cannot but arouse greater indignation from the Chinese people. The improvement of Sino-Japanese relations has been set with new and more serious obstacles by Nobusuke Kishi. It is entirely a delusional idea for people like Nobusuke Kishi to attempt to relive the old dream of Japanese imperialism by concluding a U.S.-Japan military alliance.

    The current international situation is greatly favorable to the peace-loving people and unfavorable to the imperialist war forces. The Japanese people have strengthened their ranks and expanded their strength in the struggle against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." We firmly believe that the heroic Japanese people will unite even more closely and continue their struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality to the end. U.S. imperialism and the Japanese militarist forces represented by Nobusuke Kishi will surely suffer a shameful and tragic defeat. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the Japanese people, the Asian people, and the peace-loving people of all countries in the world to jointly defend world peace and human security.

    首都各界人民反对日美军事同盟大会决议
    新华社23日讯　首都各界人民反对日美军事同盟大会决议
    1960年1月23日，中国首都各界人民庄严集会，坚决反对日美军事同盟，完全拥护我国外交部1月14日关于反对日美签订军事同盟条约的声明。中国人民一向热烈支持日本人民反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的斗争，今后将继续坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约，争取独立、民主、和平和中立的正义斗争。我们谨向英勇斗争的日本人民致以崇高的敬意。
    美日反动派不顾日本人民的强烈反对和全世界人民的一再警告，以修改日美“安全条约”为名，于1月19日在华盛顿签订了日美“共同合作和安全条约”。美帝国主义为了策划新的侵略和战争，竟撕毁有关防止日本军国主义复活和日本侵略再起的一系列国际协定，公然复活日本军国主义，把日本纳入美国的侵略性军事集团和原子战争体系。以岸信介为代表的日本军国主义势力，则妄想依附美帝国主义再度在亚洲进行扩张，重温所谓“大东亚共荣圈”的迷梦。日美军事同盟的建立，严重的威胁着中国、苏联和亚洲各国的安全，并且使日本民族再度被拖向战争灾难的深渊。
    为了反对美日反动派的罪恶行为，日本人民掀起了波澜壮阔的群众运动，曾经饱受日本军国主义侵略祸害的中国人民和亚洲人民对美日反动派的军事勾结表示极大的愤怒和强烈的反对。全世界一切爱好和平的人民，都严厉谴责美帝国主义和日本军国主义分子。
    在以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营和世界和平力量面前，美帝国主义最近被迫作出一些“表示愿意缓和国际紧张局势”姿态，企图在“和平”的烟幕下，欺骗人民，争取时间，加紧发展导弹生产，准备核战争。但是美帝国主义的马脚是隐藏不住的。不久以前，美国政府公开宣布将随时恢复核武器试验，并已进行了一系列的地下核试验。美帝国主义在欧洲正加紧恢复西德纳粹势力的同时，现在又悍然同日本军国主义势力缔结军事同盟，这就进一步暴露了它的“假和平，真备战”的面目。
    美日反动派缔结军事同盟，想解脱它们由于为战争侵略政策造成的困难和孤立的处境。但是，它们是饮鸩止渴，遭受到了越来越猛烈的全世界人民的公愤，陷入了更困难、更孤立的境地。它们变本加厉地敌视中国，尤其不能不引起中国人民更大的愤慨。中日关系的改善，又被岸信介设下了新的更严重的障碍。岸信介之流企图靠缔结日美军事同盟以重温日本帝国主义的旧梦，这完全是狂妄的想法。
    目前的国际形势大大有利于爱好和平的人民，而不利于帝国主义战争势力。日本人民已在反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争中，坚强了队伍，壮大了力量。我们深信，英勇的日本人民，一定会更加团结一致，再接再厉地把反对日美军事同盟，争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争进行到底。美帝国主义和以岸信介为代表的日本军国主义势力，都必定要遭到可耻的悲惨的失败。中国人民愿和日本人民、亚洲人民及爱好和平的世界各国人民一起，共同为保卫世界和平与人类安全而努力。
