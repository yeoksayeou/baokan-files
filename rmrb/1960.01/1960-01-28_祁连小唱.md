    Ballads of Qilian
    Gansu Jiuquan Iron and Steel Company Rèn Qǐbāng
    Wandering in the Sky
    North wind blows snow white,
    Wandering the construction site on a cold night,
    A wonderful and beautiful scene,
    Red flowers cover the branches.
    "Where is the gardener?"
    "Ascending the ninth heaven."
    Holding a welding gun,
    Concentrating on picking the Big Dipper.
    Looking up carefully,
    He waves to me,
    Only hear a cry,
    "Come on, wander in the sky!"
    Full of Pearl Light
    The spring breeze universally benefits Yumen Pass,
    Stepping onto Qilian, close to the sun,
    Looking out over the Gobi, full of pearl light,
    Breaking through the plan, rushing ahead of spring.
    Early Spring Wind
    Swift horse with four hooves of wind,
    Steel city opens with a red start,
    Thousand-year-old snow of Qilian,
    First touches the early spring wind.
    Singing for the New Spring
    Opening the door to welcome a new scene,
    Advanced elements are all over Qilian, north and south,
    The east wind blows vigorously, everything is red,
    All four seasons are spring.

    祁连小唱
    甘肃酒泉钢铁公司　任启浜
    天上游
    北风吹白雪，
    寒夜工地游，
    一幅奇丽景，
    红花满枝头。
    “园丁他何在”？
    “登上重天九”。
    手握电焊枪，
    专心摘牛斗。
    仰首仔细观，
    他向我招手，
    只听一声唤，
    “来呀，天上游！”
    珠光满
    春风普度玉门关，
    踏上祁连近日边，
    纵目戈壁珠光满，
    突破计划抢春前。
    早春风
    骏马四蹄风，
    钢城开门红，
    祁连千秋雪，
    先着早春风。
    唱新春
    开门迎来一片新，
    祁连南北遍先进，
    东风劲吹处处红，
    一年四季皆是春。
