Several Questions on Breeding Chlorella
Wenzhou Special District Agricultural Science Research Institute

    Q: Is it difficult to cultivate Chlorella, and can production teams cultivate it?

    A: The cultivation technology of Chlorella is not complicated. As long as we grasp the technical key to Chlorella production and strengthen management, it can be done. The equipment for cultivating Chlorella is also very simple. For example, a concrete drying ground, when not drying grain, can be a good production pool by building walls two or three feet high around it; vacant manure pits can also be used; it would be even better if new production pools could be built. In addition, mixers (which can be replaced by rakes), bamboo baskets, buckets, as well as human and animal manure, and a small amount of fertilizer powder are needed. The production team can handle these things.

    The following technical keys should be noted in Chlorella production: ① The culture solution should be rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium fertilizer and trace nutrients such as iron, magnesium, manganese, and sodium. ② The temperature should be appropriate, preferably between 24 and 28 degrees Celsius. ③ There should be sufficient sunlight, with at least four hours of light per day, preferably more than eight hours. ④ Stir four to five times a day to increase air and carbon dioxide. ⑤ The culture solution is best neutral. If the acidity is too high, add caustic soda; if the alkalinity is too high, add sulfuric acid or dilute hydrochloric acid.

    Q: Is there a simple method to measure the acidity and alkalinity of the culture solution?

    A: Generally, culture solutions made of 4% to 8% of decomposed human waste are mostly neutral and do not need to be tested for acidity and alkalinity. If it is necessary to measure the acidity and alkalinity, immerse a universal PH test paper (available at pharmacies) in the culture solution. After five or six seconds, compare the color on the test paper with the standard color. Blue is alkaline, and red is acidic.

    Q: How to prepare human waste culture solution?

    A: Filter the decomposed human waste with a double-layer sack, and add four to eight catties of human waste to one hundred catties of water to make human waste culture solution. Using 5% chicken manure as a culture solution also has a good effect on cultivating Chlorella. Cow, pig, sheep, and rabbit manure can also be used as culture solutions.

    Q: How to cultivate algal strains?

    A: First prepare the culture solution, and then inoculate the algal strains into the culture solution. Pay attention to temperature, sunlight, and stirring. After Chlorella grows and reproduces, add a small amount of culture solution every one or two weeks to replenish nutrients.

    Q: What should I do if mosquito larvae and paramecium are found in the production pool?

    A: If paramecium and mosquito larvae are found in the pool, Chlorella will not grow. Adding a small amount of iodine solution can kill paramecium; adding 2.5 grams of 6% wettable BHC to every 100 catties of Chlorella liquid can kill mosquito larvae.

    Q: How much Chlorella should be used to feed pigs?

    A: After boiling the concentrated Chlorella solution, add it to green and coarse feed for pigs. The amount should not be too much, because it is not easy to digest if you eat too much. The general dosage is three catties of concentrated Chlorella per day for pigs weighing 50 to 60 catties; pigs weighing 60 to 100 catties can eat four to five catties of concentrated Chlorella.

    Q: Can Chlorella be cultivated in summer when the temperature is too high and in winter when the temperature is too low?

    A: Facts have proved that as long as cooling and insulation work are done well, Chlorella can still be produced outdoors in summer and winter. In summer, bamboo mats can be used to cover the pool at noon to prevent direct sunlight from shining on the pool water; if the temperature is too low in winter, fermentation of stable manure can be used for heating, that is, pile stable manure three feet wide around the production pool, and fermentation of the stable manure can increase the temperature in the pool.

    繁殖小球藻的几个问题
    温州专区农业科学研究所
    问：培养小球藻是否困难，生产队能否培养？
    答：小球藻的培养技术并不复杂，只要抓住小球藻生产的技术关键，加强管理就行了。培养小球藻的设备也很简单。如水泥底的晒谷场，在不晒谷时，周围砌上二、三市尺高的墙壁，就是很好的生产池；空闲的粪坑也可以利用；如能建筑新生产池则更好。此外，还需要搅拌器（可用谷耙代替）、团箕、水桶、以及人畜粪尿、少量肥田粉等。这些东西生产队都可以办到。
    在小球藻生产中要注意以下技术关键：①培养液中要有丰富的氮、磷、钾肥和微量的铁、镁、锰、钠等养分。②温度要适当，最好是摄氏二十四度至二十八度。③有充足的阳光，每天光照时间至少四小时，最好在八小时以上。④每天要搅拌四至五次，以增加空气和二氧化碳。⑤培养液最好呈中性反应，如果酸性太高，可加苛性钠；硷性太大，则加硫酸或稀盐酸。
    问：有什么简便方法测定培养液酸硷度？
    答：一般用4％至8％腐熟的人粪尿作成的培养液，多呈中性反应，不必再测定酸硷度。如果需要测定酸硷度，可将万用PH试验纸（西药房有出售）浸入培养液中，五、六秒钟后，把试验纸上的颜色同标准色比较，蓝色是碱性，红色是酸性。
    问：怎样配制人粪尿培养液？
    答：将腐熟的人粪尿用双层麻袋滤过，一百斤水中加入四至八斤人粪尿，就成人粪尿培养液。用5％的鸡粪作培养液，培养小球藻的效果也很好。牛、猪、羊、兔的粪便作培养液也可以。
    问：怎样培养藻种？
    答：先配制好培养液，将藻种接种到培养液里，要注意温度、阳光和搅拌工作。小球藻生长繁殖后，每隔一、二星期加入少量培养液，以补充营养。
    问：生产池中发现孑孓和草履虫，怎么办？
    答：池中发现了草履虫和孑孓，小球藻就生长不起来。滴入少量碘溶液，能杀死草履虫；放入6％的可湿性六六六（每一百斤小球藻液中加两克半），就可杀死孑孓。
    问：用小球藻喂猪，用量多少？
    答：将小球藻浓缩液煮开后，加在青粗饲料中喂给猪吃，用量不宜太多，因为吃得太多了不容易消化。一般用量是体重五十至六十斤的猪，每天吃浓缩小球藻三斤；体重六十至一百斤的，可吃浓缩小球藻四至五斤。
    问：夏天温度太高，冬天温度太低，能不能培养小球藻？
    答：事实证明，只要做好降温和保温工作，夏天和冬天在室外仍可生产小球藻。夏天，中午可用竹簟遮盖，防止太阳直接照射池水；冬天温度太低，可用厩肥发酵加温，即在生产池的四周堆厩肥三尺宽，厩肥发酵后可增加池内温度。
