They have also proposed "Every person should do a good deed for the people's commune." From the interior to the border regions, from the Northwest Plateau to the Southeast coast, thousands of officers and soldiers are active every day on various construction sites, city streets, and rural commune fields, vigorously supporting the socialist construction of the people in various regions.

    Recently, the activities of local troops supporting farmland water conservancy construction have been in full swing. Since the New Year, more than 40,000 officers and soldiers in the Nanjing area have gone to eighteen large, medium, and small water conservancy project sites such as the Qinhuai River construction site and the Hengshan Reservoir to enthusiastically carry out voluntary labor during the Spring Festival. In one week, the Jinan area troops used more than 160,000 workdays for the fifty-one water conservancy projects they were responsible for repairing. More than 1,800 officers and soldiers of the Lanzhou troops participated in the construction of the "Binhe Road" in the urban area along the Yellow River. In five days, they completed 13,751 cubic meters of excavation work with nearly 6,000 workdays. These days, Hainan Island has entered the rice transplanting season. Local troops have completed transplanting more than 4,000 mu of rice seedlings for the commune in a few days. A unit of the Qinghai garrison sent more than 400 officers and soldiers to the Houzihe Commune in Xining City to participate in canal construction. They worked alongside commune members and completed 2,625 cubic meters of earthwork. At the sea enclosure construction site of the Zhanjiang Salt Field and the Youth Canal construction site, more than 7,000 officers and soldiers are fighting to ensure the early closure of the sea enclosure dam. The troops participating in the construction of the Sanke Yushu Reservoir and the Mopanshan Reservoir main canal water conservancy projects in the Changbai Mountain area are determined to celebrate the Spring Festival on the construction site.
