    Liu Wendang Delivers Meat
    Zhang Wei

    Most residents near the Heping Vegetable Market in the Hanyang District of Wuhan know the salesperson Liu Wendang and like him. Although he isn't particular about his appearance and braves the wind and rain, being a rough-and-ready man in his thirties, he is very thoughtful. Since he responded to the Party branch's call to deliver meat and fish directly to the homes of pregnant women and new mothers, he knows exactly how many pregnant women and new mothers there are in the fifteen neighborhood committees around him, when they are due to give birth, where they live, and who is in their families. He specially bought a diary to record their names and addresses, delivering fish and meat to them regularly, and has never missed a delivery in the past year, even in strong winds and heavy rain. To ensure that no new mother is missed, he not only visits residents widely and asks the vegetable salespersons to help him keep an eye out, but also frequently inquires at the health clinic to find out who has given birth. When he delivers fish and meat to the home of a new mother, they are always grateful and surprised, saying, "My baby was just born last night, and you've delivered meat so early this morning. How is your news so well-informed?" He always replies with a smile, "It's all thanks to the help of the residents and the health clinic!" When he sees that some new mothers' families have no one to take care of them, he first delivers the meat, then helps them collect their meat coupons (extra subsidies from the government for each new mother), brings brown sugar, and asks them to write letters to their husbands working in other places to reassure them to focus on the birth and not worry about the family. The new mothers are all very grateful to him, and some even insist on making a bowl of sugar water and making him drink it before letting him go.

    One day, after finishing his morning business as usual, Liu Wendang rode his bicycle with a large basket of fresh pork, trotters, ribs, etc., to deliver meat to new mothers. After visiting a few families, he arrived at Liu Ying's home. Liu Ying works in the neighborhood office and is resting at home due to a miscarriage. He settled the account for the meat and money with the owner and was about to leave when he suddenly noticed a seven- or eight-year-old boy lying on the side of the room. He thought: I saw him lying there last time, but didn't pay attention. Today, he's still lying there. Could he be seriously ill? So he turned back and asked Liu Ying about the child's situation. This was Liu Ying's son, Wei Shiping, who, after suffering from encephalitis, could no longer move his limbs and had become mentally impaired. The government gave him extra meat rations, but Liu Ying and her husband were both working, and there was no one to take good care of him at home. After hearing this, Old Liu kept blaming himself: Why didn't I pay attention to people with serious illnesses? He quickly wrote down Wei Shiping's name and started delivering meat to him every few days. Gradually, he realized that delivering it this way meant that the sick child couldn't eat meat every day, and too much meat at once was difficult to store. After thinking about it, he simply asked for the sick child's meat coupons to manage himself, and then select the most tender lean meat to weight about two liang for the sick child. He delivered the meat in this way for eight months. When he saw Wei Shiping gradually gaining weight, his face becoming rosy, and starting to become healthier, his heart was filled with infinite happiness.

    刘稳当送肉
    张碨
    住在武汉市汉阳区和平菜场附近的居民，大部分都认识营业员刘稳当，都喜欢他。别看他穿戴不讲究，风里来雨里去，是个大手大脚三十来岁的男子汉，可是心眼却挺细。自从他响应党支部的号召，把肉、鱼等直接送到孕妇产妇家去以来，周围十五个居民委员会中，有多少产妇孕妇，她们哪天生产，都住在哪里，家里有些什么人，他都知道得清清楚楚。他专门买了个日记本，把她们的姓名、住址一笔笔记载下来，经常为她们送鱼送肉，近一年来，哪怕刮风下大雨，也从未间断过。为了做到不漏一户产妇，他不仅在居民中普遍访问，托各段卖菜的营业员帮他留意，还经常到保健站打听哪家生孩子了。当他把鱼和肉送到刚生了孩子的产妇家里时，人家总是又感激又惊讶地说：“我家昨夜才生了小孩，你们今天一早就送来了肉。你的消息怎么这样灵通呢？”他总是笑着说：“这全靠居民和保健站帮助哪！”他看见有的产妇家无人照护，就先把肉送去，再帮她们领肉票（政府给每个产妇的额外补助），捎红糖，让她们写信告诉在外地工作的丈夫安心生产，不要耽心家里。产妇们个个都十分感激他，有的还冲一碗糖水，非拉他喝了才肯放走他。
    一天，刘稳当像平常一样，当早上的营业完了之后，便骑上车子带着一大筐子新鲜的猪肉、蹄子、排骨等，出去为产妇送肉。他走了几家之后，来到了刘英的家里。刘英在街道工作，因为小产，正在家里休养。他把肉、钱给主人算清，正准备出去，忽然发现屋子一边躺着一个七、八岁的男孩。他心想：上次来时看见就躺着，可没在意，今天，他还是躺着，莫非是生了重病？便转回来向刘英问这孩子的情况。这是刘英的男孩魏世平，因为害了一场大脑炎后，四肢再不能动弹，人也变痴了。政府特别给他另外补助几斤肉，但是刘英夫妇都在工作，家里没有妥贴的人照护他。老刘听说这个情况后，不住地责备自己：为什么平时没关心有重病的人呢？他连忙把魏世平的名子记下来，以后隔几天就给他送一次肉。慢慢地，他发现这样送，病孩既不能天天吃上肉，一次肉送多了又不好保管。他想了想，干脆把病孩的补助肉票要来自己掌管着。按天挑那最嫩的瘦肉称二两，给病孩送去。他这样送了八个月。当他看着魏世平慢慢长胖了，脸红了，开始变得健康起来的时候，心里充满了无限的幸福。
