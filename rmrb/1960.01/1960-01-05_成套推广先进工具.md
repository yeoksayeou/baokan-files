    Technical innovation and technical revolution are not only matters for the industrial and agricultural production departments, but also for the commercial departments. The commercial departments can not only innovate tools and equipment and improve operational techniques, but also have a wide range, great potential, and good results. The commercial departments of Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces created and promoted a large number of advanced tools and equipment last year, which greatly improved work efficiency and work quality, which is a very good proof.
    Now that advanced tools and equipment have been created and used, how to make these advanced tools and equipment give full play to their effectiveness is a noteworthy issue in the current technical innovation of the commercial sector.
    We believe that an important task at present is to organize the strength of the masses to promote advanced tools and equipment in complete sets, so that advanced tools and equipment can be developed in a balanced manner in various processes and links. For example, the dumpling machine in the catering industry can make more than 6,000 dumplings per hour, which is many times faster than manual operation. However, if a restaurant only promotes the dumpling machine, and still uses manual operation in the steps of kneading dough, cutting vegetables, cutting meat, and mixing fillings, then no matter how high the efficiency of the dumpling machine is, it cannot be fully utilized. The same is true for the warehousing department. If only a few conveyors are created and the efficiency of commodity transportation is very high, but stacking and loading and unloading cannot keep up, the efficiency of the conveyors cannot be fully utilized. This is the case in all walks of life in the commercial sector. Only by connecting advanced tools and equipment into a whole and promoting and using them in complete sets can labor productivity be further improved.
    Another aspect of giving full play to the effectiveness of advanced tools and equipment is to provide the equipment capacity of one point to several points, a street, a district or a wider range for common use according to the conditions of the industry. For example, the fried dough stick machine in the catering industry can produce 2,400 fried dough sticks per hour, and more than 20,000 fried dough sticks per day. A breakfast shop cannot sell so many fried dough sticks in a day, so there is no need to use a fried dough stick machine separately. In such cases, it is best to adopt the method of centralized production and decentralized supply. Tianjin and Shantou, Guangdong Province, have already gained experience in this regard. After the successful creation of the soybean milk grinder in Shantou, the city's 40 households and 94 people have shifted from decentralized production with one stove and one pot to collective use of machine production, which greatly saves personnel, raw materials, and fuel. This is a very good experience. All walks of life should pay attention to this issue. If advanced tools and equipment can be used by a majority of units, they should not be used by one unit; if they can be produced centrally, they should not be produced in a decentralized manner.
    It is not too difficult to give full play to the effectiveness of advanced tools and equipment. Because many advanced tools and equipment have been relatively finalized in some regions and industries. As long as we strengthen leadership, rely on the masses, and combine the dispersed, relatively finalized, effective tools and equipment with the characteristics of various industries, after unified planning and rational matching, we will surely achieve remarkable results in a short period of time.

### 成套推广先进工具

    成套推广先进工具
    技术革新和技术革命不仅是工农业生产部门的事，也是商业部门的事。商业部门不仅能够革新工具和设备，改进操作技术，而且方面很广，潜力很大，效果很好。广东、湖南、江西、湖北四省商业部门，去年创造和推广了大批先进工具和设备，大大提高了工作效率和工作质量，就是一个很好的证明。
    先进工具和设备创造出来了，使用起来了，但是如何让这些先进工具和设备充分发挥效能，这是当前商业部门技术革新中的一个值得注意的问题。
    我们认为，当前一件重要的工作是把群众力量组织到成套推广先进工具和设备方面来，使先进工具和设备在各个工序、各个环节得到平衡的发展。比如饮食业中的饺子机，一小时能包六千多个饺子，比手工操作要快许多倍。但是，一个饭店如果只推广了饺子机，而在和面、切菜、切肉、拌馅等环节上还是用手工操作，那末，饺子机的效能再高，也不能充分发挥出来。仓储部门也是如此，倘若只创造了几台输送机，商品的输送效率很高，而码垛、装卸都跟不上，输送机的效能也同样不能充分发挥。在商业部门各行各业都是这样。只有把先进的工具和设备连成一片，成套地推广和使用，才能进一步提高劳动生产率。
    发挥先进工具和设备效能的另一方面是根据行业条件，把一个点的设备能力提供几个点、一条街、一个区或更广的范围共同使用。比如，饮食业中的油条机，一小时可以生产油条二千四百根，一天就能生产二万多根。一个早点铺一天是卖不了这么多油条的，也就不需要单独使用一部油条机。像这样的情况，最好是采取集中生产，分散供应的办法。天津市和广东省汕头市在这方面已经取得了经验。汕头市磨豆浆机创造成功之后，全市四十户、九十四人由分散的一炉一灶的生产，走向了集体使用机器生产，无论是人员、原料、燃料都大大节省。这是一条很好的经验。各行各业都应该注意这个问题。先进工具和设备能供多数单位使用的，就不要一个单位使用；能集中起来生产的，就不要分散生产。
    让先进工具和设备充分发挥效能，并不是太困难的事。因为很多先进工具和设备在一些地区和行业中已较为定型。只要加强领导，依靠群众，把分散的比较定型的行之有效的工具和设备，结合各行业的特点，经过统一规划和合理配套，就一定能在短时期内收到显著效果。
