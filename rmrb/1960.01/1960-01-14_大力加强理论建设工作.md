    Vigorously Strengthen Theoretical Construction Work
    Wang Yanan

    I

    The sixties have begun.

    In the past decade of the fifties, along with the great victories of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, as the guiding ideology of our revolution and construction, shone brightly in all aspects of China's social, political, economic, and cultural life. China's tremendous victories over the past decade are a victory for the deep development of Marxism-Leninism in China and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

    Marxism-Leninism began to spread in China in the 1920s. Every step forward in the working class revolutionary movement provided an opportunity for the in-depth dissemination of the working class revolutionary theory. However, even by the 1940s, neither the scope nor the depth of dissemination could compare with the past decade. This is easy to understand: when political power is in the hands of the people, and when the means of material production and the means of spiritual production are in the hands of the people, it is easier for the people to access the truth that represents their interests. Of course, political power is not everything. It is not enough to have a revolutionary regime to make the people believe in Marxism-Leninism. Only by combining Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution and achieving results in revolutionary practice, allowing the people to experience from real life that Marxism-Leninism truly represents their interests, will they believe in it. Marxism originated in the historical conditions of Western European countries like Germany and England around the mid-19th century. Leninism, on the other hand, emerged in Russia at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries as the Marxism of the era of imperialism and the working-class revolution. If the general principles of philosophy, political economy, and socialism of Marx and Engels had not been combined with the Russian revolutionary practice by Lenin and Stalin, it would have been difficult for the Soviet Union to smoothly achieve socialist revolution and construction. Similarly, if Mao Zedong had not combined Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, it would have been difficult for us to complete the democratic revolution so smoothly and rapidly and carry out socialist transformation and construction.

    While we affirm the great achievements made in the education and propaganda of Marxist-Leninist philosophy and social sciences in the past decade, two points are worth noting: First, our philosophical and social science research has not yet reached the level that it should have and that is actually needed; second, our study and elucidation of Mao Zedong Thought has not kept pace with the profound and far-reaching impact it has already had on all aspects of our social, political, economic, and cultural life.

    This is something we need to further strive for in the sixties.

    II

    In this decade beginning in 1960, a very arduous task is placed before our philosophical and social science circles, and that is the task of better carrying out theoretical construction.

    Theoretical construction should first and foremost be developed in theoretical struggle. In the past decade, both in philosophy and in the social sciences, we have launched a sharp struggle between two roads and achieved a decisive victory, giving Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought absolute dominance in the philosophical and social science circles. But does this mean that our theoretical struggle against bourgeois academic thought is no longer so important? Absolutely not. Social ideology generally lags behind the development of social and economic life. It was not long ago that our country completed the three major transformations and comprehensively established socialist relations of production. Although the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have been strengthening ideological remolding movements while leading the people of the whole country in socialist revolution and construction, the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology is still quite deeply rooted in the minds of many people. According to Marxist theory, ideology, as a component of the superstructure, has relative independence from the economic base. It will never be rapidly and completely eliminated with the destruction of the old base, nor will it be completely established with the establishment of the new base. This is why we must carry out a socialist revolution in the political and ideological fields after completing the socialist revolution in ownership. The reason why Marxist-Leninist philosophy and social sciences, as powerful weapons for carrying out socialist revolution in the political and ideological fields, should fully play their role in the struggle to break the old ideological system and establish a new ideological system in the future also lies here. In the coming decade, we will continue to leap forward and build socialism at high speed. Domestic and foreign enemies will also launch various attacks on our great cause on the cultural and ideological fronts to sabotage or delay our socialist construction. The task of our philosophy and social science workers is to thoroughly defeat all kinds of attacks by domestic and foreign enemies, resolutely defend the ideological and theoretical front of Marxism-Leninism, and promote the establishment and consolidation of the proletarian ideological system, so that the socialist superstructure is more adapted to the socialist economic base.

    Another aspect of theoretical construction is to make new, creative, and correct explanations of new social phenomena, social relations, and social problems. This is also a very arduous task. Leaving aside things too far in the distance, just considering the social changes since liberation, how many new social and historical problems await our in-depth scientific research! As a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, we bypassed the stage of capitalist development and quickly embarked on the road of socialist construction. Our socialist transformation did not adopt the method of expropriation towards the bourgeoisie, but the method of peaceful transformation, and successfully completed the socialist transformation of capitalist ownership. In such a backward country, adopting such a tortuous path of transformation, a great leap forward unprecedented in history has emerged, and the people's commune, a brand-new form of social organization, has emerged. If we mechanically apply Marxism-Leninism, it is difficult to have a sufficient and reasonable explanation of the philosophical and social science principles within them. If our explanation is not thorough enough and not reasonable enough, the metaphysical and empirical concepts of the bourgeoisie will cover it, hindering our progress.

    III

    From the above explanation, it is not difficult to understand how important our theoretical research, theoretical struggle, and construction work in the philosophical and social science circles will be in the coming decade, and how arduous the efforts required will be. To carry out theoretical construction in combination with the social and historical conditions of our socialist revolution and construction, it is certainly necessary to greatly develop originality. Even in carrying out theoretical criticism of the bourgeois thought and reactionary remarks in our country, it is equally necessary to develop originality. Because the doctrines and thoughts of the anti-Marxist bourgeoisie in different historical periods and under different social and historical conditions are generally put forward in conjunction with the current real social and economic problems, therefore, Marxists must have creative criticism and counter-criticism of the bourgeois ideology in order to make new contributions to theory and develop Marxism. Leninism was produced in this way, and Mao Zedong Thought was also produced in this way.

    Our theoretical struggle and theoretical construction work are arduous, but it must also be understood that we already have a good foundation to rely on to carry out this work. First of all, the philosophical and social sciences we study are all based on Marxism-Leninism, and all our country's work is guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This alone has great significance in correcting our research direction, policies, and even methods. Secondly, Marxism was originally produced as a guide to revolutionary practice. Engels once taught us: if the principles of Marxism are important, the application of those principles is equally important. Lenin's application of Marxist principles to the historical conditions of Russia at that time not only developed the principles and theories of Marxism, but also provided a model in methodology for how to apply those principles and theories. It is not difficult to imagine how much enlightenment and demonstration this has for us to study philosophy and social sciences in combination with China's social and historical conditions; especially third, we also have Mao Zedong Thought to rely on. Comrade Mao Zedong ingeniously combined Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution. He not only summarized and generalized many principles that developed Marxism-Leninism from the experience of China's long-term revolutionary movement, providing our philosophical and social science researchers with a more vivid and more practical theoretical basis, but also repeatedly told us, according to the specific historical conditions of Chinese society, that the most correct way to study and research philosophy and social sciences is to link theory with practice, to be purposeful, and to find positions, viewpoints, and methods from Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to solve the theoretical problems of China's revolution and construction. If theoretical workers cannot free themselves from the bourgeois set of ideological methods, how can they talk about launching a theoretical struggle against bourgeois doctrines and thoughts and carrying out socialist theoretical construction? Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong's repeatedly taught learning research methods and ideological work methods in the preface and postscript to "Rural Survey," in "Reform Our Study," and in other documents related to rectifying the Party's work style and learning style, must be regarded as the criteria by every comrade engaged in philosophical and social science research at any time. Comrade Mao Zedong's ideological methods were in the past, and will be in the future, the greatest reliance for us to achieve any success on the theoretical front.

    Not only that, in order to enable the research work of philosophy and social sciences to quickly catch up with the actual needs in terms of quantity and quality, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have also created many favorable conditions for us, such as the system of combining teaching, productive labor, and scientific research caused by the education revolution, such as the movement of workers, peasants, and soldiers to study philosophy and social sciences caused by the cultural revolution and ideological liberation, such as various academic discussions unfolded in accordance with the principle of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend... etc., all of which will be a reliable guarantee for our philosophical and social science circles to complete the theoretical struggle tasks and theoretical construction tasks in the coming decade.

    However, despite having such great reliance and so many reliable guarantees, this does not reduce the responsibility of our philosophical and social science workers. On the contrary, we must better study Marxism-Leninism, more effectively study and elaborate Mao Zedong Thought, more closely link with reality, take the mass line more, and more actively participate in collective research and discussion, so that we can play a leading role, a backbone role, and a bridge role in the more arduous theoretical struggle and theoretical construction tasks in the future.

    May we all shoulder the arduous tasks on the theoretical front of the sixties, hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance!

    大力加强理论建设工作
    王亚南
    一
    六十年代开始了。
    在过去十年的五十年代中，伴随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，作为我们革命和建设的指导思想的马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，在中国社会政治、经济、文化生活各方面，大放光明。中国十年来的巨大胜利，是马克思列宁主义在中国深入发展的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    马克思列宁主义是二十年代开始在中国传播的，工人阶级革命运动每向前发展一步，工人阶级的革命理论，就得到一次深入传播的机会，但即使是到了四十年代，无论是就传播的范围或深度讲，都是不能和过去十年相较量的。这个道理非常容易明白：当政权掌握在人民手中的时候，当物质生产资料和精神生产资料都掌握在人民手中的时候，人民就更容易接触到代表他们利益的真理。当然，政权并不是一切，并不是有了革命的政权，就能叫人民相信马克思列宁主义，只有使马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合，在革命实践上作出了成绩，让人民从现实生活中，体验到马克思列宁主义真是代表他们的利益的真理，他们才相信马克思列宁主义。马克思主义产生在十九世纪中叶前后的西欧德英诸国的历史条件下，列宁主义则是作为帝国主义和工人阶级革命时代的马克思主义而产生于十九世纪末二十世纪初的俄国。马克思恩格斯的哲学、政治经济学和社会主义的一般原理原则，如果不是列宁斯大林把它和俄国的革命实践相结合，恐怕苏联很难顺利实现社会主义革命和建设，同样的，如果不是毛泽东同志把马克思列宁主义和中国革命实践相结合，恐怕我们也很难得这样顺利迅速地完成民主主义革命并进行社会主义改造和建设。
    当我们肯定过去十年来马克思列宁主义哲学、社会科学的教育宣传取得了很大成绩的时候，有两点值得注意：第一，我们的哲学社会科学研究工作，还没有提高到应有的和实际需要的程度；第二，我们对于毛泽东思想的钻研和阐扬，远没有跟上它在我们社会政治、经济、文化生活各方面已经发生的深刻而深远的影响。
    这是需要我们在六十年代来进一步努力的。
    二
    在1960年度开始的这个十年，一个非常艰巨的任务，摆在我们哲学社会科学界面前，那就是要更好地进行理论建设的任务。
    理论建设首先应该是在理论斗争中求得发展。过去十年中，不论在哲学，在社会科学方面，我们都已经展开了两条道路的尖锐斗争，并且取得了决定性的胜利，使马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，在哲学社会科学界取得了绝对的统治地位。但这是否可以说，我们反对资产阶级学术思想的理论斗争已经不是那么重要了呢？决不能这么说。社会思想意识一般总是落后于社会经济生活的发展的。我们国家完成三大改造，全面确立起社会主义生产关系，还是不久以前的事。尽管中国共产党和毛主席在领导全国人民进行社会主义革命和建设中，一直在加强思想改造运动，但是，资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想意识，在不少的人们的头脑中还是相当根深蒂固的。根据马克思主义的理论，作为上层建筑的组成部分的思想意识对经济基础说来，有着相对的独立性。它决不会随着旧基础的消灭而迅速完全消灭，随着新基础的建立而完整地建立起来。我国在所有制方面完成社会主义革命以后，还要在政治思想方面进行社会主义革命的道理就在这里。马克思列宁主义的哲学和社会科学作为政治思想方面进行社会主义革命的有力武器，在今后破旧的思想意识体系、立新的思想意识体系的斗争中应该充分发挥自己的作用，道理也在这里。在今后十年中，我们将持续跃进，高速度地建设社会主义，国内外敌人在文化思想战线上也一定会对我们伟大的事业作各种各样的进攻，来破坏或者延缓我们的社会主义建设。我们哲学社会科学工作者的任务就是彻底击败国内外敌人的各种各样的进攻，坚决保卫马克思列宁主义的思想理论阵地，促进无产阶级思想意识体系的建立和巩固，使社会主义的上层建筑更加适应社会主义的经济基础。
    理论建设的另一方面，就是要对新的社会现象、社会关系、社会问题，作出新的创建性的正确说明。这也是一项十分繁重的任务。且不要讲得过远，就以解放以来的社会变化情况而论，该有多少新的社会历史问题等待着我们进行深入的科学研究啊！我们以一个半封建半殖民地的国家，避开了资本主义的发展阶段，迅速走上了社会主义建设的道路；我国的社会主义改造，对资产阶级不是采取剥夺的方式，而是采取和平改造的方式，顺利地完成了资本主义所有制的社会主义改造。我们以这样落后的国家，采用这样曲折的变革途径，出现了旷古未有的大跃进局面，出现了人民公社这种崭新的社会组织形式，其中的社会科学和哲学的道理，如果是机械地搬用马克思列宁主义，也难得有充分的合理的说明。我们的说明不够透彻，不够合理，资产阶级的形而上学的经验主义的观念尘雾，就要笼罩在它上面，而使我们的前进受到妨碍。
    三
    由上面的说明，不难明了我们哲学社会科学界在今后十年的理论研究工作，理论的斗争和建设工作，该是如何重要，需要多么艰苦的努力。结合我们社会主义革命和建设的社会历史条件，来进行理论建设工作，固然需要大大发挥独创精神，就是对我国的资产阶级思想和反动言论，展开理论批判工作，同样要发挥独创精神。因为不同历史时期，不同社会历史条件下的反对马克思主义的资产阶级的学说思想，一般都是结合着当前的现实社会经济问题提出来的，所以，马克思主义者对资产阶级的思想一直要有创建性的批判和反批判，才能在理论上作出新贡献，来发展马克思主义；列宁主义是这样产生的，毛泽东思想也是这样产生的。
    我们的理论斗争和理论建设工作，任务是繁重的，但是也必须理解到，我们进行这个工作，已经有很好的依靠。首先，我们所研究的哲学社会科学，都是以马克思列宁主义作为基础，我们国家的各项工作，都是以马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想作为指导思想。单就这点来讲，在端正我们的研究方向、方针，乃至方法上，已经有了非常重大的意义。其次，马克思主义原来就是当作革命实践的指南而产生的。恩格斯曾教导我们：如果说马克思主义的原理原则重要，那些原理原则的应用，是同样重要。列宁把马克思主义原理原则应用到俄国当时的历史条件下，不仅发展了马克思主义的原则和理论，还在方法论上提出了如何应用那种原则理论的典范，这对于我们结合中国社会历史条件来研究哲学社会科学，该有多大的启发示范作用，是不难想见的；特别是第三，我们还有毛泽东思想作为依靠。毛泽东同志天才地把马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践结合起来，他不仅从中国长期革命运动经验中，总结概括出了许多发挥、发展马克思列宁主义的原理原则，为我们哲学社会科学研究者提供了更生动更切合中国实际的理论基础，同时他还根据中国社会的具体历史条件，反复告诫我们，学习研究哲学社会科学的最正确途径，就是理论联系实际，就是有的放矢，就是从马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林那里找立场、观点、方法，来解决中国革命建设的理论问题。如果理论工作者还不能从资产阶级的那一套思想方法中解脱出来，怎么谈得上向资产阶级学说思想展开理论斗争，并进行社会主义理论建设呢？所以，毛泽东同志在“农村调查”的序言和跋中，在改造我们的学习中，以及在其他有关整顿党风学风文献中，反复教导我们的学习研究方法和思想工作方法，在任何时候，都是我们每个从事哲学社会科学研究工作的同志必须奉为圭臬的。毛泽东同志的思想方法，在过去是，在今后还是我们在理论战线上取得任何成就的最大的依靠。
    不仅如此，为了使哲学社会科学的研究工作，能在量上，在质上，很快地赶上实际需要，党中央和毛泽东同志还为我们创造了许多有利条件，如由教育革命导致的教学、生产劳动和科学研究三结合的制度，如由文化革命、思想解放引起的工农群众学习哲学社会科学的运动，如依据百家争鸣方针展开的各种学术讨论……等等，都将是我们哲学社会科学界完成今后十年的理论斗争任务和理论建设任务的可靠保证。
    可是，尽管我们有了这么大的依靠，这么多的可靠保证，这并不能减轻我们哲学社会科学工作者的责任，恰好相反，我们必须更好地学习马克思列宁主义，更切实地钻研和阐扬毛泽东思想，更密切地联系实际，更多地走群众路线，更积极地参加集体研究和讨论，使自己在今后更加繁重的理论斗争和理论建设任务中，起带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用。
    愿我们大家肩负着六十年代理论战线上的艰巨任务，高举着马克思列宁主义旗帜，高举着毛泽东思想旗帜前进！
