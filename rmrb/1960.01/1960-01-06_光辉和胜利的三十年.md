Thirty years ago today (January 6, 1930), Nguyen Ai Quoc (original name of President Ho Chi Minh), the first Vietnamese communist, convened a meeting in Hong Kong. The meeting decided to merge the three communist organizations existing in Vietnam at that time (Indochinese Communist Party, Annam Communist Party, and Indochinese Communist League) into the Vietnamese Communist Party. Since then, the Vietnamese revolution has entered a new stage.

In October 1930, the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Communist Party held its first meeting in Hong Kong, deciding to change the name of the Party to the Indochinese Communist Party.

During the period from 1930 to 1945, the Party led the Vietnamese people in a long struggle, achieved victory in the August Revolution, seized power, and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

During the period from 1945 to 1954, the Party led the people in a nine-year war of resistance against the French, finally forcing the French colonialists to sign the Geneva Accords and restore peace in Indochina.

In February 1951, the Party convened its Second National Congress, decided to change its name to the Vietnam Workers' Party, and adopted a new Party Program and Constitution.

After the restoration of peace, the Party led the people to quickly heal the wounds of war, completed land reform in North Vietnam, and is currently actively carrying out socialist transformation and socialist construction, striving to consolidate the North and achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

The Vietnamese Communist Party (the predecessor of the Vietnam Workers' Party) immediately engaged in the struggle to lead the Vietnamese people in the national democratic revolution after its establishment. The upper picture shows the early publicly published Party newspaper (bottom right) and the leaflets printed by the Haiphong Workers' Party branch during the Nghe An Soviet uprising (September 1930) (top left).

In August 1945, under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party (the predecessor of the Vietnam Workers' Party), the Vietnamese people overthrew the eighty-year rule of the French colonialists and the aggressive regime of the Japanese fascists.

In May 1954, the Vietnamese People's Army achieved the world-shaking victory of Dien Bien Phu. This was a decisive battle that completely crushed the French colonial army and won the national liberation war.

Since 1958, the people of North Vietnam, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, have entered a vigorous period of socialist construction. The picture above shows the delegates to the Eighth Session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam unanimously raising their hands to pass the resolution on developing and transforming the national economy in North Vietnam along the socialist path, starting from 1958.

    光辉和胜利的三十年
    三十年前的今天（1930年1月6日），越南的第一个共产党员阮爱国（胡志明主席原名）在香港召开了会议，会议决定把当时越南存在的三个共产主义组织（东洋共产党、安南共产党和东洋共产联盟）合并为越南共产党，从此，越南革命走上了新的阶段。
    1930年10月，越南共产党中央在香港召开了第一次会议，决定把党的名称改为印度支那共产党。
    在从1930年到1945年的时期中，党领导越南人民进行了长期的斗争，取得了八月革命的胜利，夺取了政权，成立了越南民主共和国。
    在从1945年到1954年的时期中，党领导人民进行了九年抗法战争，终于迫使法国殖民者签订了日内瓦协议，恢复了印度支那的和平。
    1951年2月，党召开了第二次全国代表大会，决定改名为越南劳动党，并通过了新的党纲和党章。
    和平恢复后，党领导人民迅速医治了战争创伤，在越南北方完成了土地改革，目前正积极进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设，为巩固北方、争取和平统一祖国而奋斗。（附图片）
    越南共产党（越南劳动党的前身）成立后，立即投入了领导越南人民进行民族民主革命的斗争。上图为早期公开出版的党报（右下）和宜安苏维埃起义（1930年9月）时，海防工人党支部印发的传单（左上）。
    1945年8月越南人民在印度支那共产党（越南劳动党的前身）的领导下，推翻了法国殖民者八十年的统治机构和日本法西斯的侵略政权。上图为同年9月2日，胡志明主席以临时政府名义在河内巴亭广场宣读了著名的“独立宣言”宣告了越南民主共和国的诞生。　越南大使馆供稿（新华社发）
