Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 11th: The Chengmen Commune in Minhou County, Fujian Province, has rapidly cultivated more than 1,200 agricultural technical talents by integrating various production and construction projects with scientific research. Among them, more than 400 are technical talents in agricultural machinery, pesticides, agricultural tool reform, and agricultural infrastructure construction; more than 460 are in rice cultivation, meteorology, and other fields; more than 150 are in horticulture; and more than 50 are in animal husbandry, fisheries, and other fields.

In the period of agricultural production cooperatives, the Chengmen area began to pay attention to cultivating agricultural technicians, but planned large-scale training began after the Great Leap Forward and communization in 1958. After the establishment of the Chengmen Commune, various production tools were continuously innovated, and agricultural machinery increased rapidly. At present, the commune has four tractors, 23 water pumps, three water turbine pumps, and many new-style agricultural implements such as double-wheel double-share plows, deep plows, sprayers, and rapid harvesters and threshers. The increase in these agricultural machines and new-style tools requires members with a certain level of technical expertise to operate them. In order to maximize the effectiveness of agricultural machinery, it is necessary to carry out agricultural infrastructure construction. The technical level of cultivation management of various crops also needs to be continuously improved. All of these require the commune to quickly train more agricultural technical talents to adapt. Therefore, the commune and major brigades have established agricultural science research institutes and branches, and have planned to cultivate rural technical talents.

In cultivating technical talents, the Chengmen Commune Party Committee, on the one hand, strengthens political education, so that members can understand the important significance of improving scientific and technological levels for the high-speed development of agricultural production. On the other hand, it strengthens the technical learning of members through various production and construction practices. For example, when the commune was newly building and expanding tractor stations and pumping stations, it selected a group of young members to follow the technical personnel sent by the relevant departments of the province and county to help with the work, learning while laboring. Over the past year or so, more than 40 pumping station chiefs, technicians, and technical personnel have been trained through this method.

The Chengmen Commune has more than 1,900 mu of citrus orchards. In order to train technical personnel to manage fruit trees, under the unified organization of the commune, each production team, with the fruit tree professional team as the center, promoted various advanced technologies and summarized the experience of old fruit farmers through the cultivation, management, and experimentation of various fruit trees, so that each production team with fruit trees in the commune trained more than 20 fruit tree production technical personnel.

The agricultural science research institutions of the commune and the production teams also organized cadres at all levels and members to conduct various production experiments and research, planting large areas of high-yield experimental fields and high-yield fields. The members and cadres who participated in these experiments and research greatly improved their technical level through the combination of production practice and scientific research. They often led the members to cultivate according to new technologies, ensuring a bumper harvest of late rice in the entire commune last year.

The Chengmen Commune also took advantage of the opportunity for teachers and students from Fujian Agricultural College to come here for internships, organizing technical personnel, members, and cadres to experiment, research, summarize, and promote various advanced production technologies together, which played a significant role in cultivating and improving the scientific and technological level of the commune's technical talents.

Due to the rapid growth and strengthening of technical talents, and the emphasis on promoting advanced experiences and advanced technologies, the agricultural production of the Chengmen Commune has made great leaps forward year after year. In 1959, the average yield of rice in the entire commune was 1,479 jin per mu, an increase of 25% over the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, exceeding the production target set in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule and in excess. Animal husbandry and sideline production also increased by 100% to 200% respectively compared to 1958.

    边劳动边学习　边研究边提高
    城门公社技术人材迅速成长
    新华社福州11日电　福建闽侯县城门公社结合各项生产建设和科学研究，迅速培养了一千二百多名农业技术人材。其中，有农业机械、农药、农具改革和农业基本建设方面的技术人材四百多人，稻谷栽培、气象等方面的四百六十多人，园艺方面的一百五十多人，畜牧、渔业等方面的五十多人。
    城门地区在农业生产合作社时期，就开始注意培养农业技术人员，但是有计划的大批培训还是从1958年大跃进和公社化以后开始的。城门公社成立后各种生产工具不断革新，农业机械迅速增加。目前，全社已有拖拉机四台，抽水机二十三台，水轮泵三部，还有很多双轮双铧犁、深耕犁、喷雾器以及快速收割器、打谷机等新式农具。这些农业机械和新式工具的增加，需要具有一定技术水平的社员操纵；为了发挥农业机械的效能，需要进行农田基本建设；各种农作物的栽培管理技术水平也需要不断提高。这些，都要求公社迅速培训出更多的农业技术人材来适应。因此，公社和各大队都建立了农业科学研究所和分所，有计划地培育农村技术人材。
    城门公社党委在培养技术人材中，一方面加强政治教育，使社员们认识提高科学技术水平对高速度发展农业生产的重要意义。一方面通过各项生产建设实际加强社员们的技术学习。如公社在新建和扩建拖拉机站、抽水机站时，便挑选了一批青年社员，跟着省、县有关部门派来帮助工作的技术人员边劳动、边学习。一年多来，通过这种办法共培养了抽水机站站长、技师、技术员等四十多名。
    城门公社共有柑桔园一千九百多亩。为了培养管理果树的技术人员，各生产队在公社统一组织下，以果树专业队为中心，通过对各种果树的栽培、管理、试验，推广各项先进技术和总结老果农的经验，使全社每个有果树的生产队都培养出二十多名果树生产技术人员。
    公社和各生产队的农业科学研究机构，还组织各级干部和社员们大搞各项生产试验、研究，种植大面积高产试验田和丰产田，参加这些试验研究的社员和干部，通过生产实践和科学研究相结合，大大地提高了技术水平。他们经常带动社员们按照新技术耕作，保证了全社去年的晚稻获得丰收。
    城门公社还利用福建农学院的师生经常来这里实习的机会，组织技术人员、社员、干部同他们一起试验、研究、总结和推广各项先进的生产技术，对培养、提高公社技术人材的科学技术水平起了很大作用。
    由于技术人材的迅速成长、壮大，重视了推广先进经验、先进技术，城门公社的农业生产连年大跃进。1959年全社水稻平均亩产一千四百七十九斤，比大跃进的1958年跃增二成半，提前超额达到了全国农业发展纲要规定的产量指标。畜牧业、副业生产也分别比1958年增产一倍到二倍。
