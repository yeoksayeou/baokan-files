    At the Signing Ceremony for the Exchange of Instruments of Ratification
    Foreign Minister Chen Yi's Speech
    Your Excellency Ambassador:
    The treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on the issue of dual nationality has been ratified by both parties in accordance with their respective constitutional procedures. Today, both parties are exchanging instruments of ratification in Beijing, and the Joint Committee composed of representatives of the two countries will soon be established in Jakarta. The treaty on the issue of dual nationality and the exchange of notes between the two Prime Ministers will take effect from now on. This is a gratifying event.
    As everyone knows, the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia is a problem left over from long-term historical development. The Chinese government has always considered it unreasonable for overseas Chinese to have dual nationality, because this is not only detrimental to the vital interests of overseas Chinese, but also could be exploited by forces hostile to the friendship between our two countries to carry out instigation and sabotage activities. Therefore, the Chinese government has consistently taken a positive attitude, striving to resolve this issue reasonably through consultation with the Indonesian government. Now that the treaty on the issue of dual nationality signed by the two governments and the exchange of notes between the two Prime Ministers on the implementation measures of this treaty have come into effect, I, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, express my congratulations and sincerely hope that through friendly cooperation and joint efforts between the two sides, the treaty can be implemented smoothly in a good atmosphere and under good conditions.
    Based on the position of striving to safeguard and strengthen the friendly relations between our two countries, the Chinese government has repeatedly expressed its desire to comprehensively resolve the issue of overseas Chinese existing between the two countries through consultation. In my letter to Foreign Minister Subandrio on December 9, 1959, I, on behalf of the Chinese government, put forward three suggestions for a comprehensive solution to the overseas Chinese issue. I am pleased to point out that the Joint Committee composed of Ambassador Huang Zhen as the chief representative of the Chinese government and Mr. Susanto Tirtoprodjo as the chief representative of the Indonesian government will be formally established in Jakarta soon. Ambassador Huang Zhen and Foreign Minister Subandrio are also conducting negotiations on other issues related to overseas Chinese. We hope that the negotiations between the two sides will be successful, so that those who voluntarily choose Indonesian nationality can smoothly acquire citizenship and become citizens of Indonesia; so that those overseas Chinese who voluntarily retain Chinese nationality and are willing to continue to reside in Indonesia can live and work in peace and continue to live in friendship with the Indonesian people; and at the same time, those overseas Chinese who cannot make a living and are unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia can return to China smoothly.
    I wish the friendship between China and Indonesia will be increasingly consolidated and developed.

    在互换批准书签字仪式上
    陈毅外长的讲话大使阁下：
    中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国关于双重国籍问题的条约已经由双方按照各自的宪法程序加以批准。今天双方在北京互换批准书，由两国代表组成的联合委员会即将在雅加达成立，双重国籍问题的条约和两国总理的换文从现在起生效，这是一件令人高兴的事情。
    大家知道，定居在印度尼西亚的华侨的双重国籍问题是由于长期历史发展而遗留给我们的问题，中国政府一向认为华侨具有双重国籍是不合理的，因为这不仅不利于华侨的切身利益，而且有可能被那些敌视我们两国友谊的势力利用来进行挑拨和破坏活动，因此中国政府一贯抱着积极的态度，争取同印度尼西亚政府通过协商合理解决这个问题。现在两国政府签订的关于双重国籍问题的条约和两国总理关于这个条约的实施办法的换文已经生效了，我代表中国政府和人民对此表示祝贺，并且真诚地希望经过双方的友好合作和共同努力，条约能够在良好的气氛和条件下顺利实施。
    中国政府本着尽力维护和加强我们两国之间的友好关系的立场，曾经一再表明了通过协商全面解决存在于两国间的华侨问题的愿望。1959年12月9日我在给苏班德里约外长的信中，代表中国政府提出了全面解决华侨问题的三项建议。我高兴地指出，黄镇大使作为中国政府的首席代表和印度尼西亚政府的首席代表苏山多·蒂托普罗佐先生组成的联合委员会即将在雅加达正式成立。黄镇大使和苏班德里约外长就其它有关华侨问题的商谈也在进行中。我们希望双方的谈判获得成功，使自愿选择印度尼西亚国籍的人能够顺利地入籍，成为印度尼西亚的公民；使自愿保留中国国籍，而又愿意继续留在印度尼西亚的华侨能够安心地居留下去，同印度尼西亚人民继续友好相处；同时使无法谋生和不愿意继续在印度尼西亚居留的华侨能够顺利地返回中国。
    祝中国和印度尼西亚两国的友谊日益巩固和发展。
