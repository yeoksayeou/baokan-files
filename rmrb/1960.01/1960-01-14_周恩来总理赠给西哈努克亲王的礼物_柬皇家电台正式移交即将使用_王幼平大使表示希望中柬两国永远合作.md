Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 12th — The Cambodian Royal Radio Station, after completing its first phase of construction, was officially handed over to Cambodia today. The Cambodian government decided at a recent meeting that it would soon be put into use.

This radio station is a gift from Premier Zhou Enlai to Prince Sihanouk. Zhang Qiang, advisor to the Cambodian Royal High Council, and Wang Youping, Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia, signed the handover document on behalf of Prince Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai, respectively.

In his speech at the signing ceremony, Zhang Qiang said: This radio station is a testament to the friendship of Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese government and people towards Prince Sihanouk and the Cambodian government and people. He expressed his sincere gratitude on behalf of Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian government and people to the Chinese leaders and people, as well as to the Chinese experts who helped build the radio station. He said that he admired the achievements made by the Chinese people under the guidance of their leaders with unparalleled enthusiasm for labor.

In his reply speech, Ambassador Wang Youping said that the radio station symbolized the friendship between the leaders and people of Cambodia and China. He pointed out that although the two countries have different systems and ideologies, there is a long-standing traditional friendship between the two countries, a friendship that makes the two peoples relatives. Ambassador Wang Youping expressed his hope that the two countries would each follow their own path to achieve their goals and cooperate forever.

Prior to the speeches, they visited the radio station, which is operated by Cambodian technicians. The first phase of the radio station's construction was laid by Prince Sihanouk in November 1958. The first phase of the project included the installation of a medium-wave transmitter and a short-wave transmitter, buildings for installing transmitters and power engines and office buildings, and a sixty-meter-high antenna. Last year, a building for the third short-wave transmitter was also built, and seven kilometers of underground cables were installed. During this period, Chinese experts helped train Cambodian technicians to operate the radio station.

    新华社金边12日电　柬埔寨皇家电台在完成了第一阶段工程以后，今天正式移交给柬埔寨。柬埔寨政府在最近举行的一次会议上决定即将交付使用。
    这座电台是周恩来总理赠送给西哈努克亲王的礼物。柬埔寨皇廷最高会议顾问张强和中国驻柬埔寨大使王幼平分别代表西哈努克亲王和周恩来总理签署了移交书。
    张强在签署仪式上致词说：这座电台是周恩来总理和中国政府与人民对西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨政府与人民的友谊的证明。他代表西哈努克亲王、柬埔寨政府和人民向中国领导人和人民以及帮助建设这座电台的中国专家们表示真诚的感谢。他说，他对中国人民在中国领导人的引导下以无比劳动热情所取得的成就表示钦佩。
    王幼平大使致答词时说，这座电台象征着柬、中两国领导人和人民的友谊。他指出，虽然两国的制度和意识形态不同，但是两国之间存在着悠久的传统友谊，这种友谊使两国人民成为亲戚。王幼平大使希望两国各自遵循自己的道路来实现自己的目标，并且永远合作。
    在讲话前，他们参观了电台，电台是由柬埔寨技术人员操纵的。这座电台的第一阶段工程是在1958年11月间由西哈努克亲王奠基的。第一阶段工程包括安装一架中波发报机和一架短波发报机，安设发报机和电力发动机的大楼和办公大楼，六十米高的天线等工程。去年还建成了供第三架短波发报机用的大楼，并安设了七公里长的地下电线。在这一期间，中国专家们帮助训练了操纵这座电台的柬埔寨技术人员。
