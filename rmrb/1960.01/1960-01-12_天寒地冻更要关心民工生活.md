It is now the "third nine" period of winter, when water turns to ice and the weather is bitterly cold, adding new difficulties to water conservancy construction sites. However, difficulties cannot intimidate heroic people. The colder the weather, the greater their enthusiasm, and the more frozen the ground, the more methods they devise. The heroic people are determined to complete the water conservancy construction tasks on time, with high quality, and in the required quantity, laying the foundation for a better leap forward in agricultural production this year.

The Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party must care for their lives; the more the Party cares for their lives, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be." The revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses is the guarantee of our past revolutionary victories and the main guarantee of our achievements in socialist construction today. The task of Party organizations at all levels is to cherish the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and while strengthening socialist education for the broad masses, to earnestly care for their lives, so that the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses will continue to rise.

Caring for the lives of the masses should be multifaceted, caring for their labor, their material and cultural lives, and even hygiene, such as haircuts and baths. Do not think that eating, sleeping, haircuts, and baths are minor matters that can be relaxed or ignored. Living issues are by no means minor matters, especially the living issues of the broad masses, which are of paramount political importance to us Communists. Twenty years ago, Chairman Mao told us to care for the lives of the masses and pay attention to working methods. In fact, improving the lives of migrant workers is an important factor in completing this year's water conservancy construction tasks quickly, well, and economically. Because people's enthusiasm relies on political awareness, but it also cannot be separated from certain material conditions. If migrant workers are working hard in freezing weather, without enough to eat or sleep, over time, it will affect the masses' enthusiasm for socialist construction and their health. How can enthusiasm be sustained then?

Does caring for the lives of migrant workers require a lot of money and increase the supply of materials? No, it doesn't. The important issue is to strengthen leadership and do a good job of organization. With these two things done, the same material conditions can play a greater role. We already have many such examples. They have not increased the expenses of the state or the commune by a single penny, but they have organized the lives of migrant workers very well. They have created a wealth of experience. Wuqing County in Tianjin is one such example. The commercial departments of this county have established "support stations" at water conservancy construction sites, adopting a "one-stop service" method to solve the living needs of migrant workers, taking care of everything from tool supply and repair to food and small merchandise, daily necessities, medicine, laundry, shoe repair, haircuts, mail delivery, and free baked cakes, doing everything possible to meet the needs of migrant workers and often delivering food and water to sick migrant workers. This spirit of service greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the migrant workers and accelerated the progress of the project. For the commercial departments, this not only did not increase expenses, but also expanded their turnover.

Caring for the lives of migrant workers also requires caring for their labor. For example, how to combine shock labor with regular labor well, and how to properly solve the problem of the masses' labor and rest are all issues that the Party organizations at each water conservancy construction site should be very concerned about. The Spring Festival is approaching. Some water conservancy construction sites will not stop work during the Spring Festival. How these sites organize the labor and rest of migrant workers, and how they organize material and recreational activities, should be arranged as early as possible. If arranged well, it will enable migrant workers to work harder and live more happily during the Spring Festival!

### 天寒地冻更要关心民工生活

    天寒地冻更要关心民工生活
    现在正是“三九”天，滴水成冰，天寒地冻，这对水利建设工地增添了新的困难。但是，困难吓不倒英雄的人民，天越寒干劲越足，地越冻办法越多。英雄的人民立志要按时、按质、按量地完成水利建设任务，为今年农业生产更好地跃进打下基础。
    党的八届六中全会决议指出：“群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众生活；党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲也会越大。”广大群众的革命干劲，是过去我们取得革命胜利的保证，也是今天我们取得社会主义建设成就的主要保证。各级党组织的任务，就是要十分珍贵群众的革命干劲，在加强广大群众的社会主义教育的同时，认真地关心群众生活，使群众的革命干劲日益高涨。
    关心群众生活应该是多方面的，既要关心他们的劳动，又要关心他们的物质、文化生活，以至理发、洗澡等清洁卫生工作。不要以为吃饭、睡觉、理发、洗澡等是小事情，因此可以放松或者不去管它。生活问题绝不是小事情，特别是广大群众的生活问题，对于我们共产党人说来，是头等重要的政治问题。二十年前，毛主席就曾经告诉我们要关心群众生活，要注意工作方法。事实上，搞好民工的生活，正是多快好省地完成今年水利建设任务的重要因素之一。因为人的干劲固然依靠政治觉悟，但也离不开一定的物质条件。如果民工们在冰天雪地里紧张地劳动，吃不好、睡不好，日久天长，就会影响群众的社会主义建设热情，也会影响群众的身体健康，那末，干劲怎样能够坚持下来呢？
    关心民工生活，是不是需要花很多钱，增加很多物资供应呢？不需要。重要的问题，在于加强领导，做好组织工作。这两条做到了，就可以使同样的物质条件发挥更大的作用。我们已经有了许多这样的典型。他们没有增加国家和公社的分文开支，就把民工的生活组织得很好。他们创造了丰富的经验。天津市武清县就是其中一个例子。这个县的商业部门在水利工地建立“随军服务站”，对民工生活上需要解决的问题，采取一包到底的办法，从工具供应、修理，到饮食小卖、日用百货、医药、拆洗衣被、修补鞋袜、理发、代送书信、免费烤饽饽等全部包揽下来，千方百计地满足民工的需要，并且经常给民工病号送饭送水。这种服务精神，大大鼓舞了民工们的劳动热情，加快了工程进度。这对商业部门来说，不仅没有增加开支，反而扩大了营业额。
    关心民工生活，还要关心他们的劳动。例如如何把突击性劳动和经常性劳动很好地结合起来，如何妥善地解决群众的劳动和休息的问题，都是各个水利工地的党组织应当十分关心的问题。春节快要来到了。春节期间有一部分水利工地是不停工的。这些工地怎样组织民工们的劳动和休息，怎样组织物质和文娱生活，更应当及早安排。安排得好，就能够使民工们在春节期间劳动的更有劲，生活的更欢乐！
