Exploring the Mysteries of Chlorella Reproduction
Zhejiang Daily Reporter Pang Youzhong

	On a sunny area of the livestock farm, twelve cement-made square pools are arranged, emitting a strong algae odor. Under the sunlight, the pool water shines with different luster, some showing a muddy yellow color, some showing a brownish-black color, and some showing a bright green color. Especially those pools of bright green water attract more attention. These pools are the Chlorella production pools of the Wenzhou Prefectural Agricultural Science Research Institute.

	The color of the water tells people: in that muddy yellow pool, the algae seeds have just been put in; in that brownish-black water, the fertilizer is decomposing, and the Chlorella is growing well; and the dark green pool water indicates that the Chlorella is about to mature. The winter climate in the southern Zhejiang area is relatively mild, and it only takes half a month from seeding to harvest.

	The third pool should be harvested. People sprinkle 0.01%-0.02% alum powder into the pool water and stir it evenly. Soon, the Chlorella begins to precipitate; the upper layer of clean water is discharged, and what remains is concentrated Chlorella. If the concentrated Chlorella is placed in a bamboo sieve and dried in the sun, it can be ground into powder and stored. This time, the third pool used a total of three thousand catties of river water, harvested one hundred and fifty catties of concentrated Chlorella, which can be made into two and a half catties of Chlorella dry powder.

	Since the first pool here started production in April 1959, eleven more pools have been built successively. Up to now, the twelve pools have harvested a total of thirty-four times, yielding approximately more than six thousand catties of concentrated Chlorella.

	Glorious Mission, Complex Experiment

	In the spring of 1959, the drums of the continued Great Leap Forward were beating loudly. The new situation of great development in animal husbandry required people to quickly solve the source of feed, especially to find refined feed that grows quickly, yields high, and has low costs. The Wenzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party entrusted this glorious task to the Wenzhou Prefectural Agricultural Science Research Institute.

	The two small bottles of Chlorella seeds brought back from the Prefectural Agricultural Bureau attracted people. Chlorella can be made into biscuits, and of course, it can also be used as pig feed. The leaders of the research institute assigned this research task to the livestock farm, and a research team was formed by livestock technician He Hua and workers Zhang Mingfu, Wu Agan, Jiang Changhua, etc., to conduct experiments.

	What does Chlorella look like? Before this, not only had the workers never seen it, but even the technician He Hua had never seen it; there was not much reference material available at the time, and some people developed a fear of difficulties. The leaders firmly said: There is no smooth road in scientific research. As long as we firmly rely on the leadership of the Party and rely on the masses, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. …

	At the end of February, the experiment officially began.

	The first step was to prepare a solution suitable for algae growth to cultivate and propagate the algae seeds. Someone introduced a Knop's nutrient solution, and the experimental team tried this formula; however, potassium nitrate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate in the formula could not be bought. Just as they started, they ran into a wall. What should they do?

	Adding potassium nitrate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate to the nutrient solution is nothing more than needing potash fertilizer and phosphate fertilizer. Wood ash contains potassium, and calcium phosphate contains phosphorus. Can these two things be used instead? The first experiment began, and the facts provided the answer: it can be replaced. However, using inorganic salts such as potassium nitrate to make nutrient solutions is costly and difficult to buy. How can it be produced on a large scale in rural areas?

	A nutrient solution suitable for the rural environment should be found. Human manure has high fertilizer efficiency and is available everywhere. Wouldn't it be great if it could be used as a nutrient solution! If human manure can be used as a nutrient solution, then can't the manure of various livestock and poultry, river mud... also be used as a nutrient solution?

	The experimental team used different amounts of human manure, pig, cattle, sheep, rabbit, and chicken manure to conduct separate experiments. The results proved that the nutrient solution made from chicken manure and 4%-8% human manure had the best effect. If 2.5% human manure plus 0.01%-0.02% ammonium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, and superphosphate are mixed to form a nutrient solution, the yield of Chlorella can be increased.

	Chlorella was successfully cultivated in the laboratory. What was placed in front of them was no longer the two small bottles of Chlorella they brought back from the Agricultural Bureau, but a large amount of Chlorella they had propagated themselves, stored in bottles of various sizes.

	Outdoor Reproduction Successful

	The research work on Chlorella entered a new stage: shifting from cultivation in glass bottles indoors to large-scale production in outdoor pools of 7.4 square meters (this is the primary condition for large-scale production). Outdoor production was even more lacking in technical equipment, and the key technical problems were even more difficult to master. However, the Party's great call to develop animal husbandry encouraged the people participating in this research work to forge ahead bravely.

	They put the nutrient solution in the pool and seeded it. On the third day, the pool water turned green; after a few more days, the algae seeds slowly sank, and the upper pool water became clear. Why did sedimentation occur before it was time to harvest? Could it be that new cells were not growing? And why couldn't new cells grow?

	At this time, He Hua remembered what Lu Baofeng, the secretary of the Party branch and deputy director of the research institute, had said: "You can't just look at the things themselves, you have to study their living habits and their relationship with the surrounding things!" That's right! Chlorella cells have chloroplast pigments that can absorb the light and heat energy of the sun and use water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients to carry out photosynthesis and produce organic matter. Then, light, temperature, air and carbon dioxide, and even the acidity and alkalinity of the nutrient solution, etc., are all closely related to the growth of Chlorella. This series of key technical issues must be resolved immediately.

	The experimental team began to conduct more than twenty experiments on the physiological characteristics of Chlorella and the requirements for living conditions, explored the mysteries of the life of this single-celled plant, and initially mastered the key technologies.

	The water in the pool changed from light green to dark green, and the harvest season arrived; the first harvest was more than forty catties of concentrated Chlorella.

	With uneasy feelings, people took the concentrated Chlorella to feed the pigs. Look, how delicious the pigs are eating! The stone in their hearts was finally put down.

	Pigs Gain Weight Significantly by Eating Chlorella

	In those days, the livestock farm workers were very excited; they were conducting experiments on the effect of feeding pigs with Chlorella. One group of pigs weighing seventy-six catties, eating only green fodder (70% revolutionary grass, 30% vegetable leaves) every day, gained an average of 0.4 catties of weight per day; while another group of pigs weighing seventy-seven catties, in addition to eating the same amount of green fodder, were fed three catties of concentrated Chlorella every day, gaining an average of 0.95 catties of weight per day. The latter group gained more than twice as much weight per day on average as the former group.

	In order to further confirm the special effects of Chlorella, Zhang Mingfu, the deputy leader of the pig-raising team, conducted experiments with refined feed such as rice bran, wheat bran, and bean cake, and Chlorella. The results showed that every catty of concentrated Chlorella fed to pigs had the same effect on weight gain as feeding the pigs two catties of fine bran or one and a half catties of wheat bran or two catties of soybean cake every day. In other words, the nutritional value of one catty of concentrated Chlorella is equivalent to two catties of fine bran or one and a half catties of wheat bran or two catties of soybean cake. The experimental team also used Chlorella to feed Dutch dairy cows, chickens, ducks, and rabbits, and the results were very good.

	People were convinced of the nutritional value of Chlorella. From then on, a new way was opened up to increase the production of refined feed for pigs.

    探索繁殖小球藻的奥秘
    浙江日报记者　庞佑中
    在畜牧场一块向阳的场地上，排列着十二个水泥做成的方形水池，散发出一股浓郁的水藻气味。在阳光的照耀下，池水闪着不同的光泽，有呈浑黄色的，有呈褐黑色的，还有呈碧绿色的。特别是那几池碧绿的水，更引起人们的注目。这些水池，就是温州专区农业科学研究所的小球藻生产池。
    水的颜色告诉人们：在那浑黄色的池水里，是刚投放了藻种；那褐黑色的水中，肥份正在分解，小球藻生长良好；而浓绿的池水，则表示小球藻快成熟了。浙南地区冬季气候也比较温和，从投放藻种到收获，只要半个月时间就够了。
    第三池该收获了。人们将0．01％—0．02％的明矾粉撒在池水中搅匀，不久小球藻开始沉淀；排出上层清水，剩下的就是浓缩的小球藻。如果把浓缩小球藻盛在团箕中，晒干后，就可磨成粉贮存起来。第三池这次共用河水三千斤，收获了浓缩小球藻一百五十斤，可制小球藻干粉二斤半。
    从1959年4月，这里的第一个池开始生产以后，陆续增建了十一个池。到现在为止，十二个池共收获了三十四次，约有浓缩小球藻六千多斤。
    光荣的任务　复杂的试验
    1959年春天，继续大跃进的锣鼓敲得震天响。畜牧事业大发展的新形势，要求人们赶快解决饲料的来源问题，特别是要求找到生长快、产量高、成本低的精饲料。中共温州地委把这个光荣的任务交给温州专区农业科学研究所。
    从专署农业局带回的两小瓶小球藻种，吸引了人们。小球藻能作饼干，当然也能做猪饲料。研究所领导上把这项研究任务交给了畜牧场，由畜牧技师何骅和工人张明孚、吴阿淦、江昌华等组成了研究小组进行试验。
    小球藻是什么样子的呢？在这以前，不但工人们不曾看到过，连技师何骅也没见过；当时可供参考的资料也不多，有些人便产生了畏难情绪。领导上坚定地说：在科学研究上是没有平坦的道路可走的。只要我们坚决依靠党的领导，依靠群众，没有克服不了的困难。……
    2月底，试验正式开始了。
    第一步，是配制一种适于藻类生长的溶液，把藻种培养、繁殖起来。有人介绍了一种克诺普氏培养液，试验小组就用这个配方试一试；可是，配方中的硝酸钾、磷酸二氢钾买不到。刚开步走，便碰了壁，怎么办呢？
    培养液加入硝酸钾、磷酸二氢钾，无非是需要钾肥和磷肥。草木灰中含有钾，磷酸钙中含有磷，能不能用这两样东西来代替？第一次试验开始了，事实作出了回答：可以代替。但是，用硝酸钾这种无机盐类来制作培养液，成本大，又不易买到，怎么能在农村大面积生产呢？
    应该找出适合农村环境的培养液。人粪尿肥效高，到处都有，要是能作培养液，那该多好！如果人粪尿可以作培养液，那么，各种牲畜、家禽的粪便、河泥……不是也可以作培养液吗？
    试验小组便用不同份量的人粪尿，猪、牛、羊、兔子、鸡的粪便，分别作了试验。结果证明：鸡粪和4％—8％的人粪尿作成的培养液，效果最好。如果用2．5％的人粪尿加上硫酸铵、硫酸镁、过磷酸钙各0．01％—0．02％，配成培养液，就可以提高小球藻的产量。
    在实验室里培养小球藻成功了，摆在他们面前的，不再是从农业局带回的两小瓶小球藻了，而是用大大小小的瓶子盛着的自己繁殖出来的大量小球藻。
        室外繁殖成功了
    小球藻的研究工作进入了一个新的阶段：从室内玻璃瓶中培养，转入到室外（这是大规模生产的首要条件），在七点四平方米的水池中大量生产。室外生产的技术设备更加缺乏，技术关键问题也更难掌握了。但是，党的发展畜牧业的伟大号召，鼓舞着参加这一研究工作的人们奋勇前进。
    他们把培养液盛在水池中，投放了藻种，第三天，池水便呈绿色；又过了几天，藻种却慢慢下沉，上层池水澄清了。为什么没到收获的时候，就出现了沉淀的现象？难道是新的细胞没有生长吗？新的细胞又为什么不能生长呢？
    这时候，何骅想起了研究所党支部书记、副所长吕宝峰说过的话：“不能光看到事物的本身，得研究它的生活习性，它和周围事物的关系！”对！小球藻的细胞里有叶绿素的色素体，能够吸收太阳的光能和热能，利用水、二氧化碳和营养元素，进行光合作用，制造成有机物质。那么，光照、温度、空气和二氧化碳，甚至培养液的酸碱度，等等，都和小球藻的生长有密切关系。这一系列的技术关键要立刻解决。
    试验小组开始就小球藻的生理特性以及对生活条件的要求等问题作了二十多次试验，探索了这种单细胞植物生活的奥妙，初步掌握了技术关键。
    水池中的水，由浅绿而深绿，收获的时节来到了；第一次收获了四十多斤浓缩小球藻。
    人们怀着不安的心情，将浓缩的小球藻拿去喂猪。看，猪吃得多么有味呀！他们心头的石块这才算落了地。
      猪吃小球藻显著增重
    在那些日子里，畜牧场工人们的心情十分兴奋；他们在进行用小球藻喂猪的效果试验。一组体重七十六斤的猪，每天光吃青饲料（70％革命草、30％菜叶），平均每天增加体重零点四斤；而另一组体重七十七斤的猪，除了吃等量的青饲料以外，每天加喂三斤浓缩小球藻，平均每天体重增加零点九五斤，后一组比前一组平均每天多增加体重一倍多。
    为了进一步证实小球藻的特效，养猪小组副组长张明孚分别用米糠、麸皮、豆饼等精饲料，和小球藻进行试验，结果每一斤浓缩小球藻喂猪后，和每天用两斤细糠或一斤半麸皮或两斤豆饼喂猪，体重增加的情况相同。也就是说，一斤浓缩小球藻的营养价值相当于两斤细糠或一斤半麸皮或两斤豆饼。试验小组还用小球藻去喂荷兰奶牛、鸡、鸭、兔子，效果都很好。
    人们对小球藻的营养价值深信不疑了。从此，为增产猪的精饲料开辟了一条新的途径。
