Listen to the Party, Follow the Party
Li Huanbo, Leader of the Youth Welding Team, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company

If you ask how we achieved all our accomplishments and victories, my answer is just one sentence: Victory comes from listening to the Party and following the Party!

Let's not even talk about the major aspects of the industrial and agricultural fronts. Just our team's experience alone can illustrate this truth.

Three years ago, Wuhan Iron and Steel was a barren wasteland overgrown with weeds. Now, it's a place of factories, towering chimneys, flowing iron, brilliant steel sparks, and labor songs echoing through the sky. My comrades in the youth welding team and I are proud to contribute to this world-renowned construction project.

Since the team's establishment in 1958, we have undertaken welding tasks for the No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces and the No. 1 and No. 2 open-hearth furnaces. Now we are transferred to the construction site of the primary rolling mill. In 1959, continuing the overall Great Leap Forward, we adhered to putting politics in command, listening to the Party, and becoming more and more enthusiastic. We competed upstream again and again, and advanced courageously together with all the builders of Wuhan Iron and Steel.

A single flower does not make spring, but a riot of color does. In order to catch up with Britain ahead of schedule and accelerate China's socialist construction, we not only promptly shared our advanced experience with brother teams, but also treated the difficulties of brother teams as our own, and actively helped them overcome difficulties. When the No. 2 blast furnace was undergoing rapid construction, the hoisting speed was very fast, with 40% of the furnace shell installed in one day and night. The next day, the welders couldn't keep up. The hoisting workers sent a key report to the welding team, which read: "The installation speed is as fast as flying, and the welding should follow closely. Welders, work harder and fly wing to wing with fast installation and fast welding." People all over the construction site were cheering for the welders. The Gong Youming team, responsible for welding the hot blast stove, was new to the job, but each of them was full of energy, and they simply forgot about getting off work and eating. Even so, they still couldn't keep up. When our team learned about this, we immediately sent two excellent technicians to support them, and I also went to the hot blast stove construction site to understand the situation. After discussing with the Party organization, we adopted the method of four-sided tack welding to first fix the installed steel plates to prevent them from deviating from the center, so that the installation workers could continue hoisting. We promptly shared this experience with the Gong Youming team and other welding teams, which greatly sped up the entire welding and installation work. The original two hooks hoisted per shift were increased to seven hooks per shift, creating a national record of only 115 hours to install the shells of three hot blast stoves.

For the needs of the country's construction, we also boldly proposed that apprentices be directly trained as blast furnace welders, which was supported by the leadership. In the past, it took five years to train a blast furnace welder, and it required a level five or six master. However, after we took a series of measures to combine improving technology with improving ideology, and combining theory with practice, we were able to train apprentices into qualified blast furnace welders in only four or five months. We also compiled a 20,000-word book on blast furnace welding experience and techniques, based on the entire team's experience and practical operation methods.

This year, Wuhan Iron and Steel's capital construction will focus on building the rolling mill system. The primary rolling mill construction project we are currently undertaking is required to be completed and put into production in the first half of this year. We are determined to listen to the Party better and work better in accordance with the Party's requirements, and always follow the Party. We are determined to continue to promote the communist spirit, and achieve a "red opening," "monthly red," and "all-round red" in 1960. Our plan is to surpass the monthly quota, exceed the quarterly target, and complete eighteen months' worth of work in one year. We are determined, under the leadership of the Party, to create more and better achievements, and strive to go to Beijing again to pay tribute to the Party and Chairman Mao.

    听党的话　跟着党走
    武汉钢铁公司青年电焊小组长　厉焕波
    若问我们的一切成就，一切胜利是怎样拿到手的？我的回答只有一句话：听党的话，跟着党走，就是胜利！
    就先别提工农业战线那些大的方面了，仅仅我们小组的经历，也就能说明这个真理。
    武钢，三年前这里还是一片荒野、杂草丛生，现在却是厂房成片，烟囱林立，铁水奔流，钢花灿烂，劳动的歌声响彻云霄。我和我们青年电焊小组的同志们，为能在这个举世闻名的建设工程里贡献力量而感到自豪。
    自1958年小组成立以来，我们先后承担过一、二号高炉、一、二号平炉的焊接任务，现在又转战在初轧厂建设工地上。在继续全面大跃进的1959年，我们坚持政治挂帅，听党的话，干劲越鼓越足，上游一争再争，和全武钢建设者一道奋勇前进。
    一花独放不是春，万紫千红才是春。为了提前赶上英国，加快我国的社会主义建设，我们不仅及时将先进经验告诉兄弟组，而且将兄弟组的困难当做自己的困难，主动帮助他们克服困难。二号高炉大搞快速施工时，吊装的速度进行得非常快，一昼夜安装了炉壳的40％，第二天电焊工就跟不上了。吊装工送来了一份关键报，给电焊小组，上面写着“安装速度快如飞，电焊也应紧跟随，焊工同志加油干，快装快焊比翼飞。”全工地的人们都在为电焊工鼓劲。负责焊接热风炉的龚友明小组虽是新手，但个个干劲冲天，简直忘记了下班和吃饭。就是这样也仍然跟不上。我们小组知道了，立即派了两名优秀技工去支援，我也到热风炉工地了解情况。经和党组织研究后，我们采取四边点焊的办法，将安装上去的钢板先固定起来，以免中心偏歪，安装工人便可继续吊装。我们及时将这一经验告诉了龚友明小组和其他电焊组，使得整个焊接和安装工作飞快进行，原来每班只能吊二钩，一下子增加到每班能吊七钩，从而创造了三座热风炉外壳仅以一百一十五小时装成的全国纪录。
    我们为了祖国建设的需要，还大胆提出了由徒工直接培养成高炉电焊工的建议，得到领导支持。过去培养一个高炉焊工，要五年的时间，还需要五、六级的师傅才行，可是经过我们采取一系列的措施，把提高技术与提高思想结合起来，把理论与实际结合起来，结果只四、五个月就能将徒工培养成合格的高炉电焊工了。我们还将全组的经验和实际的操作方法，编写了一本长达二万字的高炉焊接经验技术书籍。
    今年，我们武钢的基本建设将集中力量建设轧钢系统，我们小组目前所担负的初轧厂建设工程，要求今年上半年竣工投入生产。我们决心更好地听党的话，更好地按照党的要求工作，永远跟着党走。我们决心继续发扬共产主义风格，在1960年做到开门红、月月红、满堂红。我们的规划是：月月跨、季季超，一年干完十八个月的活。我们决心在党的领导下，创造更多更好的成绩，争取再次上北京，向党和毛主席献礼。
