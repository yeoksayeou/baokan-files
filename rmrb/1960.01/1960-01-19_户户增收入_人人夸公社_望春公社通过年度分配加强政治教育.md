Increased Income for Every Household, Everyone Praises the Commune
Wangchun Commune Strengthens Political Education Through Annual Distribution

According to a report in the Zhejiang Daily: The Wangchun People's Commune in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, recently concluded its 1959 annual distribution work. The commune members have further realized the great superiority of the people's commune, are all elated, full of confidence, and have quickly launched a new upsurge in winter production.

In 1959, the Wangchun Commune achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The average yield per mu of rice on more than 78,000 mu of land in the entire commune was 1,102 jin, an increase of 60% compared to 1958; the yield per mu of rapeseed on more than 10,000 mu of land was 155 jin, an increase of more than 80% compared to 1958. The income from diversified operations in the entire commune also increased by 40.6% compared to 1958. After the bumper harvest, in addition to completing the state grain purchase tasks, a large number of means of production were newly added through public accumulation, including 13 water pumps, 22 double-shared plows, 80 farm boats, 32 rice threshers, 350 rice transplanters, and more than 4,700 various production vehicles. 97.2% of the more than 9,000 commune member households in the entire commune increased their income compared to 1958. The average net income per household in the entire commune increased by 27.3% compared to 1958. After the distribution, the commune members carefully budgeted and actively participated in savings. More than 8,700 commune member households have deposited 550,000 yuan in the credit cooperatives. Zhang Ayao, a poor peasant commune member who had been overdrawn in previous years, received more than 200 yuan this time and also deposited 90 yuan that he did not need for the time being in the bank.

After the annual distribution, the commune members all praised the people's commune as good. The commune party committee seized this favorable opportunity to mobilize the commune members to analyze the reasons for the bumper harvest, so that the commune members further recognized the superiority of the people's commune and loved the Party and the commune even more.

When summarizing the reasons for the bumper harvest, the commune members felt most deeply that after communization, the boundaries of small townships and small cooperatives were broken, and farmland capital construction that could not be carried out by the former advanced cooperatives was undertaken, thereby promoting the high-speed development of production. The Qiyang production team of this commune was previously known as "rotten Qiyang." After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, they built some small reservoirs and ponds, and the drought resistance time increased from more than ten days to more than thirty days. However, with the development of production, the commune members urgently demanded larger-scale water conservancy construction. During the time of the advanced cooperative, this team had planned to dig through an eight-mile-long canal, but the plan was not realized due to the limitations of manpower, materials, and financial resources. After the establishment of the commune, under the unified leadership of the commune, large-scale labor cooperation was carried out. After 53 days of hard work, a "Upstream River" was built, which was eight miles long, eight meters wide, and three and a half meters deep, and the drought resistance capacity increased from the original 30 days to 70 days. In 1959, the average yield per mu of the entire team increased by 1.74 times compared to 1958. The total labor force invested in water conservancy construction by the entire commune reached 220,000 workdays, which is equal to the total of the past three years, increasing the drought resistance capacity from the past 60 days to 80 days.

The commune members also realized that the rapid development of collective welfare undertakings by the people's commune was also an important reason for promoting the overall bumper harvest. The entire commune set up public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, liberating more than 5,000 women from busy household chores and making them a vital force in agricultural production. During the spring plowing of 1959, the commune gave full play to the role of women, and the rice transplanting task was completed ahead of schedule.

After careful summary, the commune members further saw the superiority of the people's commune, their direction became clearer, and they were encouraged to work with greater revolutionary vigor, setting off a new upsurge in winter production competition throughout the commune. The Fanrong Production Team is a model team for cultivating overwintering crops in the entire commune. They selected the Donghu Farm, a spring flower cultivation model in the Ningbo area, as their competition target, and went to Donghu Farm in Shaoxing five times to "learn from experience." Now, this team's rapeseed has been fertilized three times and cultivated and earthed up once. The Lianzhong Team is linked to the Fanrong Team for competition, and they are not showing weakness either. After learning that the Fanrong Team had applied the second warm seedling fertilizer, they immediately "cleared the pens" to accumulate fertilizer and carried out a surprise fertilization. In the competition, the advanced teams enthusiastically helped the backward teams, fully demonstrating the communist style. Recently, Fanrong, Fanlong, and other 24 production teams, based on the principle of equivalent exchange, organized more than 110 cadres, 1,200 commune members, and transferred 2,500 dan of human manure to support Jinxing and other seven teams in cultivating overwintering crops, so that the growth of overwintering crops in these teams quickly caught up with the level of the general teams. The mountain and water management movement is also being carried out vigorously. Now the commune members are advancing victoriously, striving for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960.

    户户增收入　人人夸公社
    望春公社通过年度分配加强政治教育
    据浙江日报消息：浙江宁波市望春人民公社最近结束了1959年年度分配工作，社员们进一步看到了人民公社的巨大优越性，人人兴高采烈，个个信心百倍，迅速掀起了冬季生产新高潮。
    1959年望春公社获得了空前大丰收。全社七万八千多亩水稻平均亩产一千一百零二斤，比1958年增加60％；一万多亩油菜亩产一百五十五斤，比1958年增产八成多。全公社多种经营收入也比1958年增加40．6％。大丰收以后，除了完成国家粮食征购任务以外，还用公共积累新添了大批生产资料，计有抽水机十三部、双铧犁二十二部、农船八十只、打稻机三十二部、插秧机三百五十部，各种生产用的车子四千七百多辆。全社九千多户社员中有97．2％的社员比1958年增加收入。全社平均每户纯收入比1958年增长27．3％。分配以后，社员们精打细算、积极参加储蓄，八千七百多户社员已存入信用部五十五万元。历年来都超支的贫农社员张阿尧这次分到二百多元，也把暂时不用的九十元存入银行。
    年度分配以后，社员们个个赞扬人民公社好。公社党委抓住这个有利时机，发动社员分析大丰收的原因，使社员们进一步认识到人民公社的优越性，更加热爱党、热爱公社。
    在总结丰收原因时，社员们体会最深的是公社化后冲破了小乡小社的界限，兴办了过去高级社办不到的农田基本建设，从而促进了生产的高速度发展。这个公社的歧阳生产队过去被人称为“烂歧阳”。解放以后在党的领导下，他们兴建了一些小型水库和山塘，耐旱时间从十多天提高到三十多天。但是，随着生产的发展，社员们迫切要求搞更大规模的水利建设。在高级社的时候，这个队曾经计划掘通八里长的河沟，由于人力物力财力等条件的限制，计划没有实现。公社成立以后，在公社统一领导下，开展了劳力大协作，经过五十三天的苦战，兴建了一条长八里、宽八米、深三米半的“上游河”，抗旱力从原来的三十天提高到七十天。1959年全队平均亩产比1958年猛增一点七四倍。全公社投入兴修水利的劳力共达二十二万个工，等于过去三年的总和，使抗旱能力从过去的六十天提高到八十天。
    社员们还体会到人民公社使集体福利事业迅速得到发展，也是促使全面大丰收的一个重要原因。全公社办起了公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园，使五千多个妇女从繁忙的家务劳动中解放出来，成为农业生产上的一支生力军。1959年春耕的时候，公社充分发挥了妇女的作用，插秧任务提前完成。
    经过认真总结，社员们进一步看到了人民公社的优越性，方向更加明确了，鼓起了更大的革命干劲，在全公社掀起了冬季生产竞赛新高潮。繁荣生产队是全社培育越冬作物标兵队，他们选择了宁波地区春花培育标兵东湖农场为竞赛对象，先后五次去绍兴东湖农场“取经”。现在这个队的油菜已施肥三次、中耕培土一次。联众队是和繁荣队挂钩竞赛的，他们也不示弱，在知道繁荣队施了第二次暖苗肥以后，当夜就“清栏”积肥，突击施肥。在竞赛中，先进队热情帮助后进队，充分发扬了共产主义风格。最近，繁荣、繁隆等二十四个生产队根据等价交换原则，组织了一百一十多个干部、一千二百个社员、调拨了二千五百担人粪，支援金星等七个队培育越冬作物，使这些队的越冬作物生长情况迅速赶上了一般队的水平。治山治水运动也轰轰烈烈地开展起来。现在社员们正乘胜前进，力争1960年更好更全面的跃进。
