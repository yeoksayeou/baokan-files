    Joyfully Reading "A Family in the Commune"
    Ma Tieding

    The poem "A Family in the Commune" by poet Zhang Zhimin, published in the People's Daily on January 8th, is a good poem.

    The revolutionary spirit of optimism, the tenacious will to struggle, the rich atmosphere of socialist life, and the fresh, vigorous, and lively writing style make it a pleasure to read.

    There is a kind of poem that may have high artistic attainments, but just as you are intoxicated in its artistic palace and fascinated by it, your heart unknowingly sinks, to the point where you don't want to do anything. It can simply be said to be a kind of spiritual high-grade opium;

    There is a kind of poem that may be ideologically healthy, but because it is written relatively dryly, it loses its due power of infection;

    There is a kind of poem where content and form are in harmony and in sync. Read it: it is both an artistic enjoyment and an overwhelming force: it wants you to strive upwards in the ocean of life. "A Family in the Commune" belongs to this category.

    How can you not like Grandpa Xichun? Resolute in struggle, with clear-cut banners, he has long broken out of the narrow and selfish net of the old peasants and rushed into the broad world of socialism and communism:

    "An un-elected head of the family,
    Manages affairs wherever they arise."

    Talented people like Chen Xuemeng have always existed among the working people. With the passage of time, they stand taller, see further, and their numbers will increase. Isn't Grandpa Xichun a remarkable figure in the style of Chen Xuemeng?!

    Xichun's father is a production team leader who is both red and expert. His expertise is the result of being red. The General Line opened the door to his heart, making him suddenly enlightened:

    "In the past, our eyes were short and our stomachs narrow,
    Now our eyes are bright and our hearts are wide.
    Then, we only cared about the mouths of our wife and children,
    Now, we embrace the General Line of Socialism."

    One heart is for the private, one heart is for the public. "Selfishness" makes people short-sighted and ignorant, and "great public-spiritedness" makes people sharp-eared and clear-eyed. This is a profound philosophy, and it is also the simple language obtained by an advanced worker from personal experience.

    "Last night when it was dark and everyone was asleep,
    She was still sitting under the oil lamp,
    Writing again,
    Drawing again."

    "Go to sleep! Don't mind Mom!
    Good articles aren't afraid of poor handwriting.
    If we were to compare the writing to our pigs,
    The smallest should be as big as a calf…"

    This is Xichun's mother, truly her voice and appearance leap off the page. Look at her strong energy and her magnificent spirit. Even if culture is a mountain, the mountain can be leveled. She is summarizing pig-raising experience, she is writing books, she has a distinct sense of class pride and self-confidence, as if saying to you: "No matter how high the peak, it is people who climb it, what is there to fear?"

    Xichun and Xichun's wife are both new peasants of the new era, both multi-talented and new people. They met on the steel battlefield and married in front of the blast furnace. That wedding was so unique and so impressive:

    Blast furnaces everywhere are the wedding candles,
    Red flag medals are the flowers of unity.

    This group of poems, when viewed separately, are lifelike portraits; when viewed together, they are a vibrant scroll of heroes. This is not just a family in the commune, it is an epitome of thousands of households in the commune. The commune and the people of the commune are like blooming flowers everywhere!

    Comrade Zhang Zhimin has taken a gratifying step, and I wish him a harvest of poetry in advance!

    喜读“公社一家人”
    马铁丁
    1月8日人民日报发表了诗人张志民的“公社一家人”，是一首好诗。
    革命的乐观主义精神，顽强的斗争意志，浓郁的社会主义生活气息，以及清新刚健，活泼生动的文风，使人读了觉得可喜。
    有一种诗，也许艺术上的造诣很高，但是，正当你陶醉在他的艺术之宫里而又着了迷的时候，不知不觉地心沉了下去，以致什么事情也不想干。简直可以说，是一种精神上的高级鸦片；
    有一种诗，也许思想上是健康的，但是，因为写得比较枯燥，以致失去了应有的感染力量；
    有一种诗，内容和形式，合拍和谐。你读一读吧：既是一种艺术上的享受，又是一种形势逼人的力量：要你在生活的海洋里，力争上游。“公社一家人”就是属于这一类。
    你怎能不喜欢喜春爷？斗争坚决，旗帜鲜明，他早已冲出了旧农民狭隘、自私的罗网，奔向社会主义、共产主义的广阔天地里去了：
      “没经选举的当家人，
    哪处儿有事哪处管。”
    像陈学孟那样的能者，劳动人民中历来就有，随着时代的推移，他们站得更高，看得更远，数目也会越来越多，喜春爷，难道不正是陈学孟式的风流人物吗？！
    喜春爹是个又红又专的生产队长。他的专，乃是红的结果。总路线打开了他的心灵的门户，使他豁然开朗：
    “早先咱眼短肚又窄，
    如今咱眼明心又宽。
    那时只装着老婆孩子三张嘴，
    如今装的是社会主义总路线。”
    一颗心是私，一颗心是公，“私心”使人短视愚昧，“大公”使人耳聪目明。这是深邃的哲理，也是一个先进劳动者从切身感受中所获得的朴素的语言。
    “昨晚天黑人睡定，
    她还坐在油灯下，
    又是写，
    又是画。”
    “睡去吧！别管妈！
    好文章可不怕字儿差。
    要用字儿比咱的猪，
    顶小的也该有牛犊儿大……”
    这就是喜春妈，真是声音笑貌，跃然纸上。你看她好顽强的劲儿，又是好雄伟的气魄。就算文化是座大山，大山也可以踏平。她在总结养猪经验，她在著书立说，她身上有一种鲜明的阶级自豪感、自信力，仿佛对你说：“再高的高峰，也是人攀登上去的，怕什么？”
    喜春和喜春妻都是新时代的新农民‘都是多面巧手，一代新人。它们在钢铁战场上认识，又是高炉阵前结婚。那个婚礼，好别致、好威风：
    遍地高炉是鸾凤烛，
    红旗奖章是同心花。
    这组诗，分开看是毕真的肖像画；合起来看，是一幅生意盎然的英雄榜。这岂是公社一家人，这是公社千家万户的一个缩影，公社、公社人，犹如朵朵鲜花，遍地开放！
    张志民同志迈出了可喜的一步，让我预祝他诗作的丰收！
