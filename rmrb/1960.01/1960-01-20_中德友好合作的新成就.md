    New Achievements in Friendly Cooperation Between China and Germany

    The Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Deputy Prime Minister Heinrich Rau has concluded its visit to our country. The press communiqué regarding the delegation's visit pointed out that during the visit, Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai received the delegation, extensively exchanged opinions on international issues of mutual concern and on the socialist construction of both countries, and reached completely consistent views. During the visit, the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic also signed a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and a Trade Exchange Agreement for 1960 to 1962. The visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic to our country, the talks between the two sides, and the signing of new treaties and agreements between China and Germany have achieved significant results in further strengthening and developing the friendly cooperation between the governments and peoples of China and Germany, and have made new contributions to the cause of world peace.

    The friendly cooperative relations between China and Germany are based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and are based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect, and mutual assistance. Precisely because of this, this friendly cooperation has become more consolidated and developed year by year, and has borne increasingly rich fruits. Over the past decade, the people of our two countries have forged unbreakable fraternal friendship. This friendship not only helps the rapid development of socialist construction in China and Germany, but also helps to strengthen the strength of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    As early as ten years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "People's Germany and People's China are both at the forefront of the great struggle against imperialism." This sentence has even greater practical significance in the current international situation. The Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic visited our country at a time when US imperialism is stepping up the revival of Japanese militarism in the East and actively rearming West Germany in the West. Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, disregarding the strong opposition of the Japanese people, has gone to the United States to conclude a US-Japan military alliance with the US government. This has greatly increased the danger of war in the Far East. West German revanchists are increasingly embarking on Hitler's path of expanding "living space." Adenauer clamors that West Germany must be "strong enough to recover lost territories." The recent anti-Semitic activities rampant in West Germany are also the inevitable result of the US imperialism and the Bonn ruling clique's consistent policy of reviving militarism. It is clear that US imperialism's rapid revival of Japanese and West German militarism will not only make them enemies of the people of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, but also pose a serious threat to peace in Asia and Europe, as well as to world peace. Therefore, the press communiqué of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic visiting our country emphasized: "Both sides unanimously stated that they will wage unremitting struggles against such actions that seriously endanger peace and to safeguard world peace." This is entirely necessary and is in line with the common aspirations of the people of China and Germany and the common interests of the people of all countries who love peace. We believe that today, when the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic are so strong and consolidated, and when the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has greatly surpassed the aggressive forces of the imperialist camp, the people of our two countries, by persisting in struggle and continuously strengthening unity with the people of all countries in the world, will certainly be able to defeat all the wild plans of US imperialism and the reactionaries of Japan and West Germany.

    Both China and Germany also expressed their desire to achieve general disarmament, hoping that the upcoming summit conference will reach an agreement on specific disarmament measures based on the Soviet Union's proposals. In order to solve the issue of concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanys and normalizing the situation in West Berlin, our government fully supports the position of the German Democratic Republic, and the summit conference should include German representatives.

    The Chinese people are satisfied with the results achieved in this China-Germany talks and are determined to make unremitting efforts to continuously strengthen China-Germany friendly cooperation. We firmly believe that through this visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, the deep friendship between the people of China and Germany will be further consolidated and developed.

    中德友好合作的新成就
    以海因里希·劳副总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团已经结束了在我国的访问。关于代表团访问的新闻公报指出：在访问期间，毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席和周恩来总理接见了代表团，就双方关心的国际问题和两国的社会主义建设问题广泛地交换了意见，并取得了完全一致的看法。在访问期间，德意志民主共和国政府代表团还同我国签订了两国通商航海条约和1960年到1962年两国交换货物协定。德意志民主共和国政府代表团的这次访问我国、双方的会谈和中德两国之间新的条约和协定的签订，在进一步加强和发展中德两国政府和人民之间的友好合作方面获得了重大的成就，并对世界和平事业作出了新的贡献。
    中德两国之间的友好合作关系，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础之上的，是建立在平等互利、互相尊重和互相帮助的原则之上的。正因为如此，这种友好合作一年比一年巩固和发展，并且结出了一年比一年丰硕的果实。十年来，我们两国人民已经结成了牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊。这种友谊不但有助于中德两国社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，同时也有助于加强以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的力量。
    早在十年以前，毛泽东同志曾经指出：“人民的德国和人民的中国同处在反对帝国主义的伟大斗争的最前线”。这句话在目前国际形势下具有更大的现实意义。德意志民主共和国政府代表团这次来访我国之际，正是美帝国主义在东方加紧复活日本军国主义，在西方积极重新武装西德的时候。日本首相岸信介不顾日本人民举国一致的强烈反对，已经前往美国，同美国政府缔结日美军事同盟。这样就大大地增加了远东的战争危险。西德复仇主义者日益走上希特勒扩展“生存空间”的道路。阿登纳叫嚣西德必须“强大到能够收复失地的程度”。最近在西德各地猖獗一时的反犹活动，也正是美帝国主义和波恩统治集团一贯奉行复活军国主义政策的必然后果。很显然，美帝国主义迅速复活日本和西德军国主义，不仅将使它们同中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国人民为敌，同时也是对亚洲和欧洲和平以及全世界和平的严重威胁。因此，德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问我国新闻公报强调指出：“双方一致表示，他们将为反对这种严重危害和平的行径，为保障世界和平而进行不懈的斗争。”这是完全必要的，也是符合中德两国人民的共同愿望和爱好和平的各国人民的共同利益的。我们相信，在中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国已经如此强大巩固的今天，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量已大大超过帝国主义阵营侵略势力的今天，我们两国人民坚持斗争，并不断地加强同世界各国人民的团结，是一定能够击败美帝国主义以及日本和西德的反动派的一切狂妄计划的。
    中德双方还表示了对于实现普遍裁军的愿望，希望即将召开的首脑会议根据苏联的建议对裁军的具体措施取得协议。为了解决同两个德国缔结和约和使西柏林局势正常化问题，我国政府完全支持德意志民主共和国的立场，首脑会议应该吸收德国代表参加。
    中国人民对这次中德会谈所获得的成果表示满意，并且决心为不断加强中德友好合作而进行不懈的努力。我们深信，通过德意志民主共和国政府代表团的这次访问，中德两国人民之间的深厚友谊，必将得到进一步的巩固和发展。
