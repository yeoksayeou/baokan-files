Financial and banking work can also launch mass movements
Miao Manshan, First Secretary of the Jiangyou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Sichuan Province

The great leap forward in financial and banking work in Jiangyou County took shape amidst the new situation of high-speed development in industrial and agricultural production and the people's communes. Last year, the county's pig iron production increased fourfold compared to 1958, and a small-scale, foreign-style steel base was initially established. Industries such as machinery, chemicals, glass, paper making, and refractory materials have correspondingly developed rapidly. In agriculture, although the county encountered the most severe drought in over twenty years, the total grain output still increased by 13.8% compared to 1958. To meet the needs of high-speed production development, the county committee, in accordance with the spirit of overall planning and comprehensive leap forward, while grasping industrial and agricultural production, also proposed the methods of adhering to political leadership and internal-external combination, and vigorously launching mass movements in the financial and banking departments. This involved continuously opposing right-leaning tendencies and inspiring enthusiasm, educating cadres to establish clear political, production, and mass viewpoints, thereby making the mass movement in the financial and banking departments surge higher and higher, achieving great results.

Overall Planning to Promote the Great Development of Industry and Agriculture

Financial and banking work occupies a distribution position in the national economy. Production determines distribution, and distribution in turn affects production. Actively carrying out financial and banking work is of vital importance to promoting high-speed development of production. To better leverage the active role of financial and banking work, the county committee, while grasping industrial and agricultural production, also treated financial and banking work as an important link in the overall work, and through the methods of "grasping," "linking," "participating," and "inspecting," made overall arrangements to ensure a comprehensive leap forward in all tasks.

Grasping: Grasping departmental work to serve the Party's central work. In addition to the county committee making overall plans and comprehensive deployments for the departmental work and central work of each period, the advanced experiences created by the business departments are promptly summarized and promoted, implemented level by level, to promote the smooth development of departmental work. At the same time, the county committee takes the lead, following the provincial committee's instruction to "grasp tightly from the beginning and grasp tightly to the end," to grasp financial and trade work; and requires the district and commune Party committees to also treat financial and trade work as the work of the entire Party, conducting regular discussions and inspections. Grasping ideology, grasping policies, grasping organization, and promptly discovering and solving problems, so that departmental work can continuously improve and develop, better serving production and the Party's central work.

Linking: Linking major movements with minor movements, linking major central tasks with minor central tasks. For major financial and banking tasks directly related to production, such as agricultural tax, government bonds, agricultural loans, and economic accounting for industrial and mining enterprises, the Party committees at all levels list them as "minor central tasks," and combine them with the unified arrangement of major central tasks in terms of time and manpower. While inspecting central work, business operations are also inspected, thus avoiding the two tendencies of purely business viewpoints and the central work squeezing out business work, and resolving the contradiction between central work and departmental work.

Participating: Enabling departments to participate in the Party committee's central work and frequently understand the Party committee's intentions. When the county committee convenes county-wide meetings or other related meetings at various times, responsible cadres from various business departments are required to attend and participate, so that they are familiar with the relevant situation and understand the work requirements. At the same time, according to the center of different periods, the organization of some business departments leading backbone, to participate in industrial and agricultural inspection, to participate in the Party's central work and production activities, so that they have more opportunities to deeply understand production, familiar with production, directly listen to the masses in the production of the business sector requirements; and thus further establish a production point of view, understand how to work through their own to serve production.

Inspecting: Inspection and supervision. Last year, the county committee carried out three major inspections in the financial and trade system, comprehensively promoting the development of various tasks; at the same time, all "minor central tasks" linked to the central work directly grasped by the Party committee adopted the method of joint inspection by workers, peasants, and merchants, and problems were immediately solved when discovered, and experiences were quickly promoted. For general daily business work, the county committee also tightened regular inspection and supervision through the financial and economic party group.

Grasp Ideology, Discern Direction, Constantly Boost Enthusiasm

Political and ideological work is the lifeline of all work. Over the past year, the county committee directly led the county's financial and banking departments to carry out three large-scale "ideological" movements, closely grasping whether financial and banking work can launch mass movements on a large scale, whether it can vigorously support and promote the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production, and the ideological tendencies of each period, and launched special debates on discussing the situation, discerning the direction, raising requirements, boosting enthusiasm, tapping potential, and adding measures. Each debate achieved significant results, enabling cadres to improve their thinking, recognize the situation, clarify the direction, and boost their enthusiasm, thus better solving the problem of financial and banking work launching mass movements on a large scale and promoting the high-speed development of production, thereby promoting a great leap forward in financial and banking work. In the "ideological" movement, the county committee instructed business departments to vigorously commend advanced individuals and establish red flags, improve the ideological level of cadres through factual comparative education. In order to better overcome the purely business viewpoint of financial and banking cadres, the county committee also planned to transfer a part of the financial and banking cadres to participate in industrial and agricultural production inspections, send them to the grassroots level, participate in production labor, and strengthen ideological training. Facts have proved that this is an effective method to overcome the erroneous thinking of "making calculations, receiving and paying," not caring about politics, not caring about production, and being detached from the center among financial and banking cadres.

In carrying out political and ideological work, the county committee paid special attention to solving the main ideological tendencies and problems of a principled and directional nature in various departments at various times, so that ideological work could be sharp and quickly achieve significant results. For example, in the work of supporting poor communes and poor teams, some bank and credit cooperative cadres believed that "poor teams are backward and work is difficult to carry out," and their confidence was not high. For this reason, the county committee successively organized the bank and credit cooperative cadres to study relevant documents, carry out free discussion and debate, criticize various incorrect ideas, analyze the great significance and favorable conditions for supporting poor teams to catch up with rich teams, strengthen production viewpoint education, and also organized bank and credit cooperative cadres to visit Shiling Credit Cooperative, which had done a good job in supporting poor teams. After such in-depth education, the cadres' understanding was greatly improved, and the determination and confidence to support poor teams to catch up with rich teams were quickly established; the cadres held oath-taking rallies, expressing their determination to the Party that they would follow the call of the county committee to "take poor teams as their home and transform poor teams into rich teams," and through their own hard work, help poor teams catch up with rich teams. More than seventy cadres from banks and credit cooperatives went deep into the poor teams, actively helping the poor teams develop production while eating, living, and working with the masses, and made significant achievements.

Political and ideological work must be carried out frequently and continuously strengthened in order to keep cadres in high revolutionary spirits, constantly improving and progressing. In February of last year, in response to the slackening mood among some financial and banking cadres, the county committee convened an enlarged meeting of financial and trade cadres throughout the county to conduct a major evaluation and inspection of the work in 1958, affirming achievements, criticizing the slackening mood, and ushering in a climax of continued leap forward. In early July, the county committee promptly convened an enlarged meeting of financial and trade cadres throughout the county, criticizing the complaints, passive waiting, and other emotions displayed by some financial and banking cadres in supporting steel and grain production, commending the good examples of finding gaps around the center and completing work tasks, unifying understanding, and once again ushering in a climax of protecting steel and grain. In September, the county committee, in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, further conducted in-depth education among financial and banking cadres, and another campaign to fight hard in September and contribute to the National Day with increased production and conservation emerged. Because the county committee frequently conducted ideological education for cadres in accordance with the Party's theory of continuous revolution and promptly promoted advanced experiences, all cadres were able to maintain a clear head and high morale.

Strengthen Leadership, Organize Collaboration, Vigorously Launch Mass Movements

The characteristics of the mass movement in the financial and banking departments of Jiangyou County in 1959 were: large scale, rapid progress, internal and external combination, all-round collaboration, and significant results. The vigorous development of the movement broke through all outdated rules and right-leaning conservative thinking. Many problems that were previously considered impossible to solve were successfully solved after mobilizing the masses. For example, in rural savings work, some people used to emphasize that there were few people and many things, and the work could not be done well, but by establishing savings groups in canteens, establishing credit stations in districts and teams, relying on the masses to handle savings, closely combining savings with production and people's economic life, and combining with canteen finance, the district and township Party committees also regarded rural savings as a part of arranging the lives of commune members, thereby making savings a task of concern to the entire Party and an urgent requirement of the masses.

Financial and banking work has a wide range of contacts, and it must be promoted through the concerted efforts of all parties and a common leap forward in order for the movement to achieve huge results. In organizing collaboration, we believe that a better method is to organize fixed collaboration in all aspects. In April of last year, in order to solve the problems of chaotic finances and high production costs of newly built enterprises, the county committee directly led the establishment of a leading group for enterprise financial management including various departments. Because the strength of various departments was used uniformly, great results were achieved in strengthening enterprise economic accounting and reducing costs. At the same time, in financial and banking work, we also divided the three collaborative zones according to administrative divisions, just like agricultural production, which greatly facilitated timely inspection and supervision, and summarized, exchanged, and promoted advanced experiences and carried out regional collaborative competition movements through the collaborative zones. In addition, we also organized finance, banks and departments to take a cooperative, short-term cooperation, sectoral cooperation and other measures to solve the problems in production. In short, developing the atmosphere of great cooperation is one of the most important conditions for promoting the leap forward work, an important part of mass movements.

In order to ensure that the movement continues to develop on a large scale, the county committee, in leading the financial and trade departments to launch mass movements on a large scale, paid attention to strengthening organizational leadership in accordance with the spirit of internal and external combination and common collaboration, and established organizations to lead the movement from the county to the district and even the commune. The county party secretary, county magistrate, district party secretary, district head, commune party secretary, and township head in charge of finance and economics personally took command. The central tasks of the Party in various periods were taken as the central content of the red flag movement in the financial and banking departments, so that the internal mass movement of the financial and banking departments and the external mass movement were closely combined to promote each other and leap forward together.

    财政银行工作也能大搞群众运动
    中共四川省江油县委第一书记　苗满山
    江油县财政、银行工作的大跃进，是在工农业生产高速度发展和人民公社化的新形势下形成的。去年全县生铁产量比1958年增加四倍，并初步建立了小洋群钢铁基地。机械、化工、玻璃、造纸、耐火材料等工业相应地得到迅速发展。农业方面，去年虽然遭遇到二十多年没有过的严重旱灾，全县粮食总产量仍然比1958年增产13．8％。为了适应生产高速度发展的需要，县委根据统筹安排、全面跃进的精神，在抓工农业生产的同时，在财政、银行部门中提出了坚持政治挂帅和内外结合、大搞群众运动的方法，不断反右倾、鼓干劲，教育干部树立明确的政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，因而使财政、银行部门的群众运动一浪高于一浪，取得了很大成绩。
    统筹安排，促进工农业大发展
    财政、银行工作在国民经济中处于分配的地位。生产决定分配，分配反过来又影响生产，积极作好财政银行工作，对促进生产高速度发展，有十分重要的意义。为了更好地发挥财政、银行工作的积极作用，县委在抓工农业生产的同时，也把财政、银行工作当成整个工作中的一个重要环节，并且通过“抓”、“套”、“参”、“检”的办法，统筹安排，保证各项工作全面跃进。
    抓：抓部门工作服务党的中心工作。县委除对每个时期的部门工作与中心工作，统筹安排、全面部署以外，对业务部门创造的先进经验，都进行及时总结和推广，逐级贯彻，促使部门工作顺利开展。同时，县委做到以身作则，遵照省委关于“一开始就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”的指示精神，抓好财贸工作；并且要求区委和公社党委也要把财贸工作当做全党工作，定期地进行讨论和检查。抓思想、抓政策、抓组织，及时地发现问题，解决问题，使部门工作不断地提高发展，更好地为生产、为党的中心工作服务。
    套：大运动套小运动，大中心套小中心。对于与生产有直接联系的重大财政、银行工作任务，如农业税、公债、农贷以及工矿企业的经济核算等，各级党委都列为“小中心”，在时间上、人力上结合大中心统一安排。在检查中心工作的同时，检查部门业务，这样就避免了单纯业务观点和中心工作挤掉业务工作的两种倾向，解决了中心工作与部门工作的矛盾。
    参：使部门参与党委的中心工作，经常了解党委的意图。县委在各个时期召开全县性会议或其它有关会议时，都要各业务部门负责干部出席参加，使他们熟悉有关情况，了解工作要求。同时根据不同时期的中心，组织一些业务部门领导骨干，参加工农业检查，参加党的中心工作和生产活动，使他们有更多的机会深入生产、了解生产、熟悉生产，直接听取群众在生产中对业务部门的要求；从而进一步树立生产观点，懂得如何通过自己的工作去为生产服务。
    检：检查督促。去年县委在财贸系统开展了三次大检查，全面地推动了各项工作的开展；同时凡是与党委直接抓的中心工作套在一起的“小中心”，都采取了工农商一起检查的办法，发现问题，立即解决，有了经验，很快推广。对一般性的日常业务工作，县委也通过财经党组，抓紧经常性的检查督促。
    抓思想，辨方向  不断鼓足干劲
    政治思想工作是一切工作的生命线。一年来，县委直接领导全县财政、银行部门开展了三次规模较大的“务虚”运动，紧紧抓住财政、银行工作能不能大搞群众运动，能不能大力支持和促进工农业生产高速度发展，以及各个时期带有倾向性的思想，展开了论形势，辨方向，提要求，鼓干劲，挖潜力，添措施等专题辩论。每次辩论都收到显著效果，使干部提高了思想，认清了形势，明确了方向，鼓足了干劲，较好地解决了财政、银行工作大搞群众运动，促进生产高速度发展的问题，从而推动了财政、银行工作的大跃进。在“务虚”运动中，县委指示业务部门大力表扬先进，树立红旗，通过事实对比教育，提高干部的思想水平。为了更好地克服财政银行干部的单纯业务观点，县委还有计划地抽调一部分财政、银行干部参加工农业生产检查，下放基层，参加生产劳动，加强思想锻炼。事实证明，这是克服财政、银行干部中“打打算算，收收支支”，不关心政治、不关心生产、脱离中心等错误思想的一种有效方法。
    在进行政治思想工作中，县委特别注意解决各个部门在各个时期的主要思想倾向，和带原则性、方向性的问题，使思想工作一针见血，很快地收到显著效果。如在扶持穷社、穷队的工作中，有的银行、信用社干部认为：“穷队落后，工作不好搞”，信心不大。为此，县委在银行、信用社干部中，先后组织学习有关文件，进行鸣放辩论，批判了各种不正确的想法，分析了扶持穷队赶上富队的重大意义和有利条件，加强生产观点教育，同时还组织银行、信用社干部参观扶持穷队工作搞得较好的石岭信用社。经过这样深入教育以后，干部认识大大提高，扶持穷队赶上富队的决心和信心就很快树立起来；干部们纷纷召开誓师大会，向党表决心，一定遵循着县委提出的“以穷队为家，定把穷队变富队”的号召，通过自己的艰苦奋斗，帮助穷队赶上富队。银行和信用社七十多个干部深入到穷队，在和群众同吃同住同劳动中，积极帮助穷队发展生产，作出了显著成绩。
    政治思想工作必须经常进行，不断加强，才能使干部一直保持旺盛的革命干劲，不断提高，不断前进。去年2月，县委针对部分财政、银行干部中产生的松劲情绪，召开了全县财贸干部扩大会议，对1958年的工作展开大评比、大检查，肯定成绩，批判松劲情绪，掀起了继续跃进的高潮。7月初，县委又及时召开全县财贸干部扩大会，批判了部分财政、银行干部，在支持钢铁、粮食生产中所表现的埋怨、消极等待等情绪，表扬了围绕中心，找缝插针，完成工作任务的好的典型，统一了认识，又一次掀起了保钢、保粮的高潮。9月，县委根据党的八届八中全会精神，进一步在财政、银行干部中深入地进行了教育，又出现了一个大战9月，为国庆节献礼的增产节约运动。由于县委根据党的不断革命的理论，经常向干部进行思想教育，及时推广了先进经验，就使得全体干部能够经常保持清醒的头脑，旺盛的干劲。
    加强领导，组织协作  大搞群众运动
    1959年江油县财政、银行部门群众运动的特点是：规模大，进展快，内外结合，各方协作，收效显著。运动的蓬勃发展，冲破了一切陈规陋矩和右倾保守思想，过去认为无法解决的许多问题，经过发动群众都顺利解决了。如在农村储蓄工作上，过去有人强调人少事多，工作搞不好，但是通过食堂建立储蓄组，区队建立信用站，依靠群众办储蓄，把储蓄与生产和人民经济生活密切结合起来，和食堂财务结合起来，区、乡党委也把农村储蓄当成安排社员生活的一个内容，从而使储蓄成为全党关心的任务，成为群众的迫切要求。
    财政、银行工作联系面广，必须通过各方面通力协作，共同跃进，才能使运动收到巨大的效果。在组织协作中，我们认为比较好的方法，是组织固定性的各方面的协作。去年4月，为了解决新建企业财务混乱和生产成本高的问题，县委直接领导成立了包括各部门在内的企业财务管理领导小组，由于统一使用了各部门的力量，在加强企业经济核算、降低成本等方面都收到了很大效果。同时，我们在财政、银行工作上，也和农业生产一样按照行政区划，划分了三个协作区，这就大大便于及时检查督促，通过协作区来总结交流和推广先进经验，开展地区的协作竞赛运动。此外，我们还组织财政、银行和各部门采取一事一协作、短期协作、部门协作等办法，解决生产中的问题。总之，大兴协作之风，是推动工作跃进的重要条件之一，是群众运动的一项重要内容。
    为了保证运动持续地、大规模地向前发展，县委在领导财贸部门大搞群众运动中，根据内外结合、共同协作的精神，注意加强组织领导，由县到区以至公社，层层建立了领导运动的机构。分别由管财经的县委书记、县长、区委书记、区长、公社党委书记、乡长亲自挂帅。把党在各个时期的中心任务，作为财政、银行部门红旗运动的中心内容，使财政、银行部门内部的群众运动与外部的群众运动紧密结合起来，互相促进，共同跃进。
