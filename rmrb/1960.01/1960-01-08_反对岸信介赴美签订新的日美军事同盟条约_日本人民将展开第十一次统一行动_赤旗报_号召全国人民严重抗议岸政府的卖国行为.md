Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th dispatch: The Japanese people will hold the eleventh national unified action against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" between January 14th and 16th, opposing Nobusuke Kishi's trip to the United States to sign a new Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

This action plan was determined today at a meeting of the board of directors of the National Council to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

According to the plan, the National Council will hold a national conference on the 14th, attended by all mass organizations and local joint struggle organizations. The participants in the conference will organize delegations to protest the policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party.

On the 16th, 30,000 people in Tokyo will hold a conference and march to protest the Kishi Nobusuke government's signing of a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with the United States.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan plans to post slogans against Kishi Nobusuke's visit to the United States on the streets leading to Haneda Airport, where Kishi Nobusuke's plane is scheduled to take off.

Local organizations of the Japan Peace Committee, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations will send representatives to Tokyo during the eleventh national unified action to protest the signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

The Japan Socialist Party will send its members of the Diet to various places to give speeches against the "Security Treaty."

The Japanese Communist Party is printing one million leaflets to be distributed during the eleventh unified action, promoting the Communist Party's position against the signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and the abrogation of this treaty.

Local joint struggle conferences throughout the country have been preparing since the new year to hold conferences and launch other forms of demonstrations during the eleventh unified action.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Red Flag" published an editorial today calling on workers and people across Japan to strive for the victorious holding of the central conference to prevent Kishi Nobusuke's visit to the United States to sign the new "Security Treaty" on January 14th. The editorial pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi's remarks at his first press conference in the new year showed that he would adhere to the "Japan-U.S. cooperation" diplomatic policy, not take measures to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations, and go to the United States on the 16th to sign the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty—the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

"Red Flag" emphasized that in response to the Kishi Nobusuke government's treasonous plan, the Japanese people will hold a central conference on the 14th to express serious protests against its treasonous acts. This conference is not only to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," but also to strive for the abrogation of the "Security Treaty" and to smash the San Francisco Treaty system. At the same time, it is also the fighting beacon and general assembly ignited by the Japanese people who are striving for independence and peace at the beginning of the new year.

The editorial pointed out that the joint holding of this conference by all democratic forces means that the democratic forces, excluding the attacks of the reactionaries and the provocations of the Trotskyists, unite around the National Council to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to ensure the unified action of the democratic forces.

The editorial said that Kishi Nobusuke's treasonous act runs counter to the world situation and the development of history. Therefore, it absolutely cannot win the support of the Japanese people and the people of the world. Moreover, more and more people within the Liberal Democratic Party are demanding to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations. This situation shows that as long as the Japanese democratic forces stand on the position of justice and patriotism, firmly believe in victory, and reach a consensus on the policies of striving for the abrogation of the "Security Treaty," restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations, concluding a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, smashing the San Francisco Treaty system, and striving for the neutralization of Japan, and carry out the struggle with unified goals and plans, they will surely achieve final victory.

    反对岸信介赴美签订新的日美军事同盟条约
    日本人民将展开第十一次统一行动
    “赤旗报”号召全国人民严重抗议岸政府的卖国行为
    据新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本人民将在1月14日到16日之间举行第十一次反对修改日美“安全条约”全国统一行动，反对岸信介到美国签订新的日美军事同盟条约。
    这个行动计划是阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议今天在干事会会议上确定的。
    根据这个计划，国民会议将在14日举行所有群众团体和地方共同斗争组织参加的全国大会。大会的参加者将组织代表团向岸信介政府和自由民主党抗议它们的政策。
    16日，东京将有三万人举行大会和游行，表示抗议岸信介政府同美国签订新的日美“安全条约”。
    日本工会总评议会计划在通往岸信介的飞机准备起飞的羽田飞机场的街上贴出反对岸信介访美的标语。
    日本和平委员会、日中友好协会，恢复日中邦交国民会议的地方组织在第十一次全国统一行动的时候将派遣代表去东京，抗议签订日美军事同盟条约。
    日本社会党将派遣他们的国会议员到各地作反对“安全条约”的讲演。
    日本共产党正印制准备在第十一次统一行动中散发的一百万份传单，宣传共产党反对签订日美军事同盟条约和废除这个条约的主张。
    各地地方共同斗争会议从新年开始就一直在为第十一次统一行动时举行大会和发动其他方式的示威做准备工作。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日本全国工人和人民，为在1月14日胜利举行阻止岸信介访美签订新“安全条约”中央大会而努力。社论指出，岸信介在新年第一次记者招待会上发表的谈话表明，它要坚持“日美合作”的外交政策，不采取打开日中关系僵局的措施，并且在16日去美国签署侵略性的日美军事同盟条约——新的日美“安全条约”。
    “赤旗报”强调指出，针对岸信介政府的这种卖国计划，日本人民将在14日举行中央大会对它的卖国行为表示严重的抗议。这次大会不仅是为了阻止修改“安全条约”，而且是为了争取废除“安全条约”和粉碎旧金山和约体制，同时也是正在争取独立与和平的日本人民在新的一年开始时点燃的斗争烽火和大会师。
    社论指出，全体民主力量联合举行这个大会意味着民主力量排除反动派的攻击和托洛茨基分子的挑衅，团结在阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议的周围，确保民主力量的统一行动。
    社论说，岸信介的卖国行为是同世界形势和历史的发展背道而驰的。因此，它绝对不能获得日本人民和全世界人民的支持。况且，目前自由民主党内部越来越多的人士要求打开日中关系僵局。这种情况表明，只要日本民主力量站在正义和爱国立场，坚定胜利信心，在争取废除“安全条约”、恢复日中邦交、缔结日苏和约、粉碎旧金山和约体制和争取日本中立化的政策上取得一致的看法，并且以统一的目标和计划进行斗争，必定能够获得最后胜利。
