Shen Jinzhao, the head of the Zhou Tang Pig Farm in Zhiguang People's Commune, Guixi County, Jiangxi Province, and a Communist Party member, led the masses in striving for self-reliance and overcoming all difficulties to build a thousand-head pig farm on the desolate Red Stone Ridge. He also transformed more than 190 mu of barren land around it to grow feed.

In June 1956, Shen Jinzhao, then in his fifties, carrying the entrustment and expectations of the township Party branch, was the first to come to the desolate Red Stone Ridge to build a pig farm. Building a farm in such a place meant starting everything from scratch. Shen Jinzhao brought his family's old sow, a bamboo bed, and some scattered utensils such as pots and bowls. The township Party branch sent more than a dozen people to use old wood from the village and stones from Red Stone Ridge to build a temporary dormitory, which served both as a pen for the old sow and as their bedroom. During the day, Shen Jinzhao led the masses to build pigsties, and at night he carefully fed the sow. After the pigsties were built, twenty-four more pigs were brought from the village. Shen Jinzhao's wife also moved to Red Stone Ridge to work as a feeder, along with several other feeders, and that's how the pig farm was started.

In the blink of an eye, it was autumn, and it hadn't rained for a long time. The pig farm had to use the accumulated water in the stone caves to cook feed for the pigs. The accumulated water gradually dried up, and the severe drought threatened the lives of these pigs and the consolidation of this newly built pig farm. Shen Jinzhao wandered around Red Stone Ridge, looking for water sources. At this time, the words of some backward villagers echoed in his mind: "How can you build a pig farm on Red Stone Ridge? It's really 'like a dog biting a mouse, all labor and no reward.'" At the same time, he also remembered the instructions of Party branch secretary Peng Changji: "The Party sent you to Red Stone Ridge to build a pig farm. The place is very difficult, but the Party believes you can do it well. If you have any difficulties, the Party will help you." Recalling these words, he felt energized. He continued to search for water sources around Red Stone Ridge. One day, he saw a villager plowing in the autumn in a field not far from the pig farm. The entire field was bare and didn't grow grass, except for a clump of green grass in one corner. The overturned soil was damp. Shen Jinzhao was overjoyed and quickly went to ask the farmer what the reason was. The villager said that this corner of the field used to have a cold spring. They used a hoe to dig a hole more than a foot deep, and a trickle of spring water overflowed from the mud. Shen Jinzhao was extremely happy and ran to tell the Party branch secretary the good news. The next day, the secretary personally led more than 150 villagers to Red Stone Ridge to dig a pond in that field. After nine days of hard work, a large pond with an area of nearly one mu was successfully built. The constant flow of spring water guaranteed the pig farm's entire water needs.

With the water problem solved, there was still a shortage of feed. He led the feeders to sow the first batch of vegetable seeds in the thin fields around Red Stone Ridge. However, very few seeds sprouted, and those that did were very weak. The experiment failed, so they had to transport feed from the village and send people to collect wild feed everywhere. This was not a long-term solution! Shen Jinzhao and the feeders continued to study the matter of growing vegetables on Red Stone Ridge. They adopted a layered fertilization method to improve the soil, applying pig manure every time they plowed, and the soil turned from yellow to grayish-black. This time, the seeds that were sown grew very well. At the same time, they also used ponds and stone caves to breed aquatic plants. By 1957, feed was available in all seasons.

This pig farm also seized the work of breeding piglets. The sow that Shen Jinzhao brought gave birth to a litter of piglets in the winter of that year, a total of twelve. When the piglets were born and huddled to one side, he didn't have time to get pig bedding and hurriedly took off his cotton trousers to wrap the piglets. The feeders also selected fourteen sows from the existing twenty-four pigs for breeding. In the spring of 1957, they successively bred one hundred and four piglets. In the autumn, they bred another one hundred and sixteen piglets. The pig farm prospered day by day. In 1958, the farm's pigs grew to five hundred and twenty; in 1959, the pig herd approached a thousand. The number of people on the pig farm increased from a few to more than forty. They not only raised pigs but also were responsible for cultivating more than 190 mu of land. Due to the large amount of pig manure applied over the years, the barren soil of Red Stone Ridge had become fertile land. In 1959, the average yield per mu for the early and late seasons was 786 jin, and after deducting the people's food rations and the pigs' feed grain, they sold more than 7,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. In the past three years, they have dug three ponds one after another, each pond full of fish. The desolate and impoverished mountain ridge has now become a breeding base for live pigs and a "land of fish and rice."

    沈进照排除万难
    在红石岗上建起千头养猪场
    江西贵溪县志光人民公社周塘养猪场场长、共产党员沈进照，带领群众发奋图强，排除万难，在荒凉的红石岗上办起了一所千头猪的养猪场，并且改造了周围一百九十多亩贫瘠的土地种植饲料。
    1956年6月间，五十多岁的沈进照，带着乡党总支的嘱托和期望，第一个来到荒凉的红石岗兴建养猪场。在这样的地方建场，一切都得从头做起。沈进照带来他家里的一头老母猪，一张竹床，还有锅、碗等零星用具。乡党总支派了十几个人，利用村里的旧木料和红石岗的石块，先搭起了一座临时宿舍，一边圈那头老母猪，一边作为他们的卧室。白天，沈进照带领群众，修建猪舍，晚上精心喂好那头母猪。猪舍建成后，又从村里赶来了二十四头猪，沈进照的老伴也搬到红石岗来担任饲养员，加上其他几个饲养员，就这样把养猪场办起来了。
    转眼到了秋天，许久没有下雨，养猪场只得用石窟里的积水煮饲料喂猪。积水渐渐枯干了，干旱严重威胁着这群猪的生命，威胁着这个新建不久的养猪场的巩固。沈进照于是在红石岗四周徘徊，寻找水源。这时，村里一些落后群众的话在他脑海中回旋：“红石岗怎能办猪场啊，真是‘狗咬老鼠劳累无功’。”他同时也想起了党总支书记彭昌继的嘱咐：“党派你去红石岗办猪场，那地方很艰苦，但是党相信你能办好。有什么困难，党会帮助你。”想起这一段话，浑身的劲都上来了。他继续在红石岗四周寻找水源。一天，他看见村里的一个社员在离养猪场不远的田里秋耕，整片田光秃秃的不长草，只有一块田角长了一丛青草，翻起的泥土，湿漉漉的，沈进照心里一喜，飞快前去问耕田的社员，那是什么原因。那个社员说，过去这块田角常出冷泉。他们用锄头挖了一尺多深的洞，一丝泉水溢出泥面。沈进照高兴极了，连跑带跳的把这个喜讯告诉党支部书记。第二天，书记亲自带领一百五十多个社员来到红石岗，在那块田里挖塘。经过九天奋战，一口近一亩田面积的大水塘修建成功了。源源不断的泉水，保证了养猪场全部用水的需要。
    水解决了，饲料又不足了。他又带领饲养员在红石岗四周的瘦田里，播下了第一批蔬菜种子。可是种子很少发芽，有的发了芽，苗也很瘦。试验失败了，只好从村里运来饲料，另外派人四处采集野生饲料。这终究不是长远的办法呀！沈进照和饲养员们继续研究在红石岗种菜的事。他们采取了分层施肥的办法，改良土壤，耕一次，施一遍猪粪，泥土由黄色变成了灰黑色。这次播下的种子，都长得很好。同时，又利用池塘、石窟繁殖水生植物，到1957年，饲料做到四季不缺。
    这个养猪场还抓紧了仔猪的繁殖工作。沈进照带来的母猪，在当年冬天生了一胎仔猪，共十二只。当仔猪出生后，蜷伏在一旁，他来不及拿猪窝草覆盖，连忙脱下棉裤把仔猪包起来。饲养员们又在现有的二十四头猪中，挑选了十四头母猪配种。1957年春天，先后繁殖了一百零四只仔猪。秋天，又繁殖了一百一十六只仔猪。养猪场一天一天兴旺起来了。1958年，全场猪发展到五百二十头；1959年，猪群已接近千头。养猪场由过去几个人增加到四十多人，他们不仅养猪，而且负责耕种一百九十多亩田。由于连年施了大量的猪粪，红石岗的瘠土已变成了良田。1959年，早晚两季平均亩产七百八十六斤，除去人的口粮和猪的饲料粮，还卖给国家七千多斤余粮。三年来，他们先后挖了三口水塘，塘塘鱼满。荒凉贫瘠的穷山岗，现已变成生猪的繁殖基地和“鱼米之乡”。
