Fiberglass Sheets

    A year ago, workers at the Tianjin Fiberglass Factory were still making small mirrors by hand. Now, they have begun to produce dazzling fiberglass sheets, profiles, and other new products. The workers at the Tianjin Fiberglass Factory call this change a "leap of the times."

    This mirror factory, originally reorganized from a handicraft cooperative, had workers who didn't know what fiberglass was. The factory's equipment consisted of simple tools such as hammers, knives, and brushes. However, after more than two months of hard work, the workers of this factory finally created a mobile drawing furnace capable of withstanding high temperatures of 1400 degrees Celsius, and began producing technically complex fiberglass.

    玻璃钢板
    一年前，天津玻璃钢厂的工人还在用手工制造小镜子。现在，这里已经开始生产一块块耀眼的玻璃钢板材、型材等新产品了。天津玻璃钢厂的工人把这个变化称作“跨时代的飞跃”。
    这个原来由手工业合作社改组的制镜厂，职工们谁也不知道玻璃钢是什么玩艺。工厂所有的设备不过是鎯头、小刀、刷子等一些简单的工具。可是这个厂的工人，经过两个多月的苦战，终于制成能耐高温一千四百度的移动拉丝炉，开始生产技术复杂的玻璃钢。
