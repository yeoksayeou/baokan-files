    Let the Experience of the Dazhi Steel Plant's Key Problem Solving Campaign Blossom and Bear Fruit

    The Dazhi Steel Plant extensively mobilized the masses, organized comprehensive collaboration, concentrated superior forces, and focused on major key problems, driving the overall work forward. This quickly launched a new upsurge of mass-based technical innovation and revolution, resulting in a brand-new situation in production. This approach, under the guidance of the principle of comprehensive planning and strengthened leadership, mobilizing the masses, boldly innovating, and concentrating forces to tackle key problems, can be summarized in five words: Investigate, Rank, Attack, Compete, Build. These are five interconnected links with certain stages. Investigate key problems, rank key problems, and determine key problems are about organizing the masses to discover contradictions, analyze contradictions, and grasp the main contradictions. Attack key problems is about mobilizing the masses, boldly innovating, organizing technical performance competitions, and tackling key problems. While attacking, build and summarize and promote advanced experiences, which is to conduct mass-based summaries, strengthen enterprise management, achieve the requirements of consolidation and improvement, and prepare for the next campaign. The continuous process of key problem solving campaigns is also the process of "from the masses, to the masses;" concentrating, persisting; constantly discovering contradictions, resolving contradictions, from practice to understanding, and then guiding practice; repeatedly conducting, constantly improving, and constantly innovating. Chairman Mao taught us: "We must use all our strength to find its main contradiction. Once the main contradiction is grasped, all problems will be readily solved." There are many contradictions within an enterprise, and it is necessary to grasp the main contradictions, that is, to grasp the main key problems. The Dazhi Steel Plant grasped the weak link of the entire plant, the smelting problem, as the main key problem, and comprehensively mobilized the masses to investigate, rank, and determine key problems; requiring all departments, units, and even groups and individuals to determine their own key problems around this main attack direction, so that major key problems drive minor key problems, minor key problems promote major key problems, and key problems are interconnected. Under the ideological guidance of everything for steel, serving steel, and paving the way for steel, the entire plant was of one mind, with everyone working together, focusing on the main key problems, organizing different units and different types of work, assigning responsibilities, and working together to tackle and break through the key problems. Major key problems are attacked in a concentrated manner, minor key problems are attacked in a decentralized manner, key problem solving is related to the attack, irrelevant parties collaborate, the front attacks, the rear supports, combining each other to achieve comprehensive results. Forming a grand and vigorous battle with key problem solving as the center, and all other aspects of work revolve around and serve the center. When the key problems are broken, steel production increases, and other work is also driven forward. This is the concrete manifestation of grasping the center, driving the general, leading the way, and having all horses galloping.

    The key problem solving campaign is carried out under the centralized leadership of the Party, with clear goals, strict organization, and detailed plans, requiring continuous strengthening of enterprise management. The key problem solving campaign is also a mass movement of large-scale, plant-wide mobilization for technical innovation, requiring extensive and in-depth development of labor emulation. This specifically embodies the principle of combining centralized leadership with large-scale mass movements. The method of the key problem solving campaign greatly promoted technical innovation and technical revolution. Because the key problem solving campaign put forward clear goals, specific measures, and requirements for promoting advanced experiences for mass-based technical innovation, and organized all parties to collaborate and support, it could extremely widely mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses for innovation and creation, so that the masses' innovation suggestions were put forward more, more accurately, realized quickly, and had greater effects, changing the past phenomenon of thousands of innovation suggestions, but few realized and small effects. The key problem solving campaign pointed out specific goals for labor emulation, and labor emulation specifically organized and mobilized the masses for the key problem solving campaign. Various forms of labor emulation of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping, and the key problem solving campaign are closely combined and mutually reinforcing, which can be said to be like fish in water, blending together. After promoting the advanced experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's technical performance competitions, it not only formed a system of competition, but also further developed the key problem solving movement. Because technical performance competitions can concentrate the wisdom of the broad masses, continuously improve the technical level of employees, and use the most excellent advanced technology and advanced experience to accelerate the breakthrough of key problems. The key problem solving campaign requires continuous strengthening of enterprise management. As production key problems are broken one by one, production and technical levels rapidly improve, the old and unreasonable rules and regulations are broken through, and new rules and regulations that adapt to production needs and have been proven by mass summaries and practice are naturally established in the key problem solving process. Since all departments organized large-scale collaboration, everything served production, and marched towards the main attack direction, uncoordinated phenomena were reduced, and management and technical departments were better able to combine with production. The experience of the Dazhi Steel Plant fully shows that the key problem solving campaign is a good form of combining large-scale mass movements with strengthening enterprise management, and it is also an example of making economic work more and more meticulous.

### 让大冶钢厂攻关战役的经验开花结果

    让大冶钢厂攻关战役的经验开花结果
    大冶钢厂广泛发动群众，组织全面大协作，集中优势力量，围攻主要关键，带动全盘工作，从而迅速掀起了群众性的技术革新和技术革命的新高潮，使生产上出现了一个崭新的局面。这种在全面规划、加强领导的方针指导下，发动群众，大胆革新，集中力量，围攻关键的作法，可以归纳为五个字：查、排、攻、赛、建。这是相互交错而又有一定的阶段性的五个环节。查关键，排关键，定关键，就是组织群众发现矛盾，分析矛盾，抓住主要矛盾。攻关键就是发动群众，大胆革新，组织技术表演赛，围攻关键。边攻边建，总结推广先进经验，就是进行群众性的总结，加强企业管理，达到巩固提高的要求，并作好下一战役的准备工作。攻关战役不断进行，循环不已的过程，也就是从群众中来，到群众中去；集中起来，坚持下去；不断发现矛盾，解决矛盾，从实践到认识，再去指导实践；反复进行，不断提高，不断革新的过程。毛主席教导我们：“要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”企业里面矛盾很多，必须抓住主要矛盾，也就是要抓住主要关键。大冶钢厂就抓住了全厂的薄弱环节冶炼问题，作为主要关键，全面发动群众进行查关、排关、定关；要求各部门、各单位以至小组和个人都围绕这个主攻方向定出自己的关键，作到大关带小关，小关促大关，关关相联。在一切为了钢，为钢服务，为钢开路的思想指导下，全厂一条心，上下一股劲，围绕主要关键，把不同单位、不同工种都组织起来，分工负责，通力协作，攻关破关。大关集中攻，小关分散攻，有关攻关，无关协作，前方攻关，后方支援，互相结合，全面开花。形成一场以攻关破关为中心，其他各方面工作都围绕中心，服务于中心的声势浩大、轰轰烈烈的战斗。关键破了，钢上去了，其他工作也就带动起来，这就是抓住中心，带动一般，一马当先，万马奔腾的工作方法的具体表现。
    攻关战役是在党的集中领导下进行的，有着明显的目标，严格的组织和周密的计划，要求不断加强企业管理。攻关战役又是规模宏大、全厂动员的大搞技术革新的群众运动，要求广泛深入地开展劳动竞赛。这正是具体体现了集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针。攻关战役的方法大大促进了技术革新和技术革命。由于攻关战役给群众性的技术革新，提出了明确的目标、具体的措施以及推广先进经验的要求，组织了各方协作和支援，因此就能够极其广泛地调动广大群众革新创造的积极性，使得群众的革新建议提得多，提得准，实现快，效果大，改变了过去革新建议千千万，但实现少、效果小的现象。攻关战役为劳动竞赛指出了具体目标，而劳动竞赛则为攻关战役具体组织发动了群众。比、学、赶、帮的各种形式的劳动竞赛和攻关战役是紧密结合，互相促进的，可以说是如鱼得水，水乳交融。推广鞍钢技术表演赛的先进经验以后，不仅使竞赛形成一个体系，而且使攻关运动有了进一步的发展。因为技术表演赛能够集中广大群众的智慧，不断提高职工技术水平，用最优秀的先进技术和先进经验来加速突破关键。攻关战役要求不断加强企业管理，随着生产关键逐个突破，生产和技术水平迅速提高，旧的不合理的规章制度被冲破了，而新的适应生产需要，并经过群众总结和实践证明了的规章制度，在攻关过程中自然地建立了起来。由于各部门组织了大协作，一切为生产服务，向主攻方向进军，不协调的现象减少了，管理和技术部门能够更好地和生产结合了。大冶钢厂的经验充分说明，攻关战役是把大搞群众运动和加强企业管理结合起来的好形式，也是经济工作愈做愈细致的榜样。
