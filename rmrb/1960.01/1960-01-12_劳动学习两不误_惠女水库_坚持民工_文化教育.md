Labor and Learning Go Hand in Hand
Huinü Reservoir Persists in Cultural Education for Migrant Workers

    (Reported by our newspaper) Since the migrant workers entered the site in July 1958, the Huinü Reservoir construction site amateur school in Huian County, Fujian Province, has persisted in teaching, and has eliminated illiteracy for 6,807 young and middle-aged people, accounting for 80% of the young and middle-aged migrant workers on the construction site. At present, more than 190 amateur schools combining politics, culture, and technology have been set up on the construction site, and all of the more than 10,400 young and middle-aged migrant workers on the site have been enrolled. Through learning, the migrant workers have not only improved their culture but also their ideological awareness, which has stimulated their enthusiasm for labor and promoted the smooth progress of the project. One squad of the Yanfeng Brigade, with thirty female migrant workers, all removed their illiteracy tags, and their enthusiasm for work soared, exceeding the quota for carrying stones by 70%–80%; transportation exceeded the quota by 60%, and they received ten red flags one after another. Because the cultural courses were closely integrated with technical courses, technological innovation was greatly promoted. The Third Platoon of the Fifth Brigade learned the advanced experience of twisting straw ropes, increasing the average from 35 meters of rope twisted per person per day to 300 meters. More than 620 literate migrant workers on this construction site have been promoted to be cadres of large, medium, and small teams, record keepers, and teachers and teaching assistants in civil schools.

    The Party Committee of the Huinü Reservoir construction site has always insisted on carrying out cultural and technical education for migrant workers. Even during the tense stage of the dam closure project in October 1959, the Party Committee did not suspend learning due to the tight production schedule. The Party Committee moved the classroom from the thatched hut to the construction site, and the number of people participating in learning still remained at 98%.

    劳动学习两不误
    惠女水库　坚持民工　文化教育
    本报讯　福建惠安县惠女水库工地业余学校，自1958年7月民工进场以来，坚持教学，己经扫除了青壮年文盲六千八百零七人，占工地青壮年民工的80％。目前工地举办了政治、文化、技术相结合的业余学校共有一百九十多个班，全场一万零四百多个青壮年民工已全部入学。通过学习，不但使民工提高了文化，还提高了思想觉悟，激发了劳动热情，推动了工程顺利进展。岩峰大队有一个小队，三十个女民工全摘掉了文盲帽子，劳动干劲高涨，扛石头突破定额70％—80％；运输突破定额60％，先后得到十面红旗。由于文化课与技术课紧密结合，大大促进了技术革新。第五大队第三中队学习了搓草绳的先进经验，由平均每人每天搓绳三十五米提高到三百米。这个工地识了字的民工，已有六百二十多人被提拔为大、中、小队干部、记工员和民校教师、教学辅导员。
    惠女水库工地党委一直坚持进行民工的文化、技术教育，即使像1959年10月大坝堵口工程紧张阶段，党委也不因生产紧张停歇学习，工地党委把课堂从草房搬下工地现场，参加学习的人数仍然保持在98％。
