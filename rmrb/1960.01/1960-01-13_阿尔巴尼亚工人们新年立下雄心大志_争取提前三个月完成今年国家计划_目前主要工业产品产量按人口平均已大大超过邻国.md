Tirana, January 12th (By our reporter Ge Baozhi) Reporting: The Albanian workers, advancing along the socialist road with firm steps, set ambitious goals at the beginning of 1960, putting forward the bold slogan of completing this year's national plan three months ahead of schedule and overfulfilling the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960). They proposed that this year the labor productivity of the industrial sector should be increased by 12%, the production cost should be reduced by 5%, and the state should save 905 million leks.

At the same time, in the first few days of this year, good news of production has been coming from all directions. Textile factory worker Stiqi Lito, who was awarded the title of Socialist Labor Hero, has already begun the work for the second half of 1963. Oil well drilling workers in Patos Oil City broke the drilling progress in the first four days of the New Year, drilling 429 meters deep. In particular, the production team led by Sejrat Indirsha has already completed 40% of the January plan in four days.

This high-spirited drive of the Albanian working people is a continuation of their great victory on the industrial and agricultural production fronts in 1959.

1959 was the fifteenth year of Albania's victorious liberation, and the broad masses of working people carried out extraordinary labor to celebrate this national festival. In this year, Albania's total industrial output value increased by 18% compared with 1958. Calculated on a per capita basis, Albania averaged 322 kilograms of crude oil per person this year, far surpassing Italy, Turkey, and Yugoslavia; coal was 183 kilograms, exceeding Greece and Italy; chromium ore was 164 kilograms; as early as 1956, calculated on a per capita basis, Albania's chromium production had already exceeded Turkey by two times and Yugoslavia by thirteen times.

In 1959, Albania's total agricultural output value increased by 27% compared with 1958, of which grain and tobacco increased by 38% and 55% respectively; more than 31,000 hectares of new land were reclaimed. The Albanian people are proud of completing the task of agricultural collectivization determined by the Third Congress of the Albanian Labor Party one year ahead of schedule. Now, cooperatives have been established in every village in the plains and hilly areas, and the socialist component accounts for 89.5% in agriculture. In the past year, the people's government built more than 216,000 square meters of new housing for the working people in urban and rural areas. Socialist commerce sold 29% more bread and 27% more oil to the people than in 1958.

The magnificent socialist labor competition deepened and broadened in this year. Many advanced figures promoted production with brilliant labor and set an example with a communist style. There were 856 youth production teams, totaling 9,533 people, participating in the struggle to win the glorious title of "Production Team for the 15th Anniversary of the Liberation of the Motherland". The exemplary action of the advanced helping the backward further stimulated the collective spirit of the workers. Various movements to increase quotas, save raw materials, and drive cars safely for 100,000 kilometers without major repairs have also been universally promoted from one factory and one region to the whole country.

In 1959, the Albanian Labor Party formulated a decision that all cadres in the country must participate in physical labor for one month each year. Tens of thousands of cadres went deep into factories, rural areas, and various construction sites this year, living, eating, and working with workers and farmers. Comrade Shehu, leader of the Albanian Labor Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, participated in physical labor at the Sukth farm and personally planted experimental fields. Ministers of various ministries and party secretaries of each region also participated in physical labor, which further closely linked cadres and the masses.

1960 is the last year of Albania's Second Five-Year Plan. According to the decision of the recent plenary session of the Albanian Labor Party, this year's total industrial output value will reach 34.214 billion leks, an increase of 11% compared with 1959. The output of major industrial products will increase by 15% to 38% respectively, while the mining of iron-nickel ore will increase by 47%, crude oil production will be 40% more than in 1959, and the amount of new oil well drilling will also increase by 30%.

The total agricultural output value in 1960 is expected to be 35.1 billion leks, an increase of 37% compared with 1959, while the planned procurement of grain and cotton will increase by 35% and 47% respectively compared with 1959.

In the new year, there are more than 150 major construction and expansion projects. The Kurbnesh copper washing plant, which can select 150,000 tons of copper annually, and the Tirana meat processing plant, which has an annual slaughtering capacity of 9,000 tons and processes 1,500 tons of meat products, will begin to create wealth for the people this year. The Albanian Labor Party has further determined that this year's national income will increase by 18%. Seventy-eight new primary and secondary schools will open their doors to welcome the children of workers and farmers.

The Albanian Labor Party will convene its Fourth Congress this year. At this historically significant meeting, the blueprint for the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) for the development of the national economy will be formulated. This plan will transform Albania from the current agricultural-industrial country into an industrial-agricultural country.

    阿尔巴尼亚工人们新年立下雄心大志
    争取提前三个月完成今年国家计划
    目前主要工业产品产量按人口平均已大大超过邻国
    本报地拉那12日电  记者戈宝植报道：以坚定的步伐沿着社会主义道路前进的阿尔巴尼亚工人们，在1960年年初立下雄心大志，提出了要提前三个月完成今年国家计划的豪迈口号，超额完成第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）。他们提出今年工业部门的劳动生产率要提高12％，生产成本要降低5％，为国家节约九亿零五百万里克。
    与此同时，在今年开初的几天里，生产的捷报正从四面八方传来。荣获社会主义劳动英雄称号的纺织厂女工斯提基·里多目前已开始了1963年下半年的工作，巴托斯石油城的油井钻探工人在新年劳动的头四天就打破了钻探进度，深钻了四百二十九米，尤其是以赛拉特·英迪尔沙领导的生产队，四天就已完成了1月份计划的40％。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民这种热情高涨的干劲是他们在1959年在工农业生产战线取得伟大胜利的继续。
    1959年是阿尔巴尼亚胜利解放的第十五个年头，广大的劳动人民为庆祝这一全民的节日进行了不平凡的劳动。这一年，阿尔巴尼亚工业总产值比1958年增长了18％。按人口平均计算，阿尔巴尼亚在这一年中每人平均有原油三百二十二公斤，已把意大利、土耳其、南斯拉夫远远抛在后面；煤为一百八十三公斤，已超过了希腊和意大利；铬矿石为一百六十四公斤；早在1956年，按人口平均计算，阿尔巴尼亚铬的产量就已超过了土耳其两倍，超过南斯拉夫十三倍。
    1959年，阿尔巴尼亚农业总产值比1958年增长了27％，其中粮食、烟草更分别增长了38％和55％；新垦土地达三万一千多公顷。阿尔巴尼亚人民引为自豪的是提前一年完成了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第三次代表大会所确定的农业集体化的任务。现在平原丘陵地带已村村建社，社会主义成分在农业中已占89．5％。在过去的一年中，人民政权为城乡劳动人民建设了二十一万六千多平方米的新住宅，社会主义商业比1958年多售给了人民29％的面包、27％的油脂等。
    波澜壮阔的社会主义劳动竞赛在这一年日益深入和广泛，许多先进人物以光辉的劳动推动了生产，以共产主义的风格树立了榜样。参加争取获得“祖国解放十五周年生产队”这一光荣称号的青年生产队就有八百五十六个，共九千五百三十三人。先进帮助落后的模范行动更激发了工人们的集体主义精神。提高定额，节约原材料，汽车安全行驶十万公里不大修的各种运动也都从一个厂、一个地区普遍地推向了全国。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在1959年制定了全国干部每年必须参加体力劳动一个月的决定。数万名干部在这一年内深入工厂、农村和各种建筑工地，和工人农民们同住、同吃、同劳动。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导人、部长会议主席谢胡同志在苏克斯农场参加了体力劳动，并亲自种了试验田。各个部的部长和每个区的党委书记也都参加了体力劳动，这更使干部和群众紧紧地打成一片。
    1960年是阿尔巴尼亚第二个五年计划的最后的一年，根据阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的最近一次全会的决定，今年工业总产值将达三百四十二亿一千四百万里克，比1959年增长11％，主要工业产品将分别增长15％到38％，而铁镍矿的开采将增长47％，原油要比1959年多生产40％，新油井的钻探量也将增加30％。
    1960年的农业总产值预计为三百五十一亿里克，比1959年增长37％，而计划收购的粮食和棉花将比1959年增加35％和47％。
    在新的一年里，兴建和扩建的重大工程共有一百五十多项。每年可选铜十五万吨的库尔伯奈什的洗铜厂、屠宰量年达九千吨和加工肉品一千五百吨的地拉那肉品联合工厂等都将在今年开始为人民创造财富。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党更确定今年的国民收入将增长18％。将有七十八所新的中小学敞开大门接待工人和农民的子弟。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党将在今年召开第四次代表大会，在这次具有历史意义的会上，将制定发展国民经济的第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）的蓝图。这个计划将把阿尔巴尼亚从现在的农业—工业国变为工业—农业国。
