Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, 19th: According to a plan drawn up by the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, nearly 100,000 Chiang soldiers had been abandoned by the end of last year due to old age, weakness, or disability. Most of these abandoned Chiang soldiers have their homes on the mainland, and they have no relatives in Taiwan, making it difficult for them to make a living, and their lives are very miserable.

Taiwanese newspapers said that the U.S. International Cooperation Administration's Taiwan branch allocated a "U.S. Aid Special Fund" to the Chiang Kai-shek Group for a "post-settlement plan" for the abandoned Chiang soldiers. This so-called "post-settlement plan," implemented with "U.S. aid," actually turns a large number of soldiers who have been deprived of their Chiang army military status into cheap labor, driving them to build U.S. military bases, open up military highways, and work in mines and farms invested in by U.S. capital. Due to very poor living conditions and high labor intensity, many people are tortured to death.

Many Chiang soldiers who were even older, weaker, or more disabled were abandoned and, according to the plan of the U.S. advisory group, they had to "support themselves" in Taiwan. Now, in train stations or on roads in Taipei, Keelung, Kaohsiung, Chiayi, Taichung, and other places, one can often see abandoned Chiang soldiers wearing tattered military uniforms and looking gaunt, begging passers-by to "support themselves." There are also some crippled Chiang soldiers with broken arms and legs, either leaning on wooden crutches or with ragged young children beside them, displaying "military ID cards," "certificates of merit," "battle record forms," etc., issued by the Chiang army authorities over the years, begging passers-by for alms.

The social news pages of Taiwanese newspapers often reveal the tragic experiences of abandoned Chiang soldiers. Han Yiliang, a Chiang army lieutenant-level officer originally from Shandong, was driven out of the Chiang army due to injuries and disabilities. He wandered to Xinshashe Township in Taichung and built a small thatched shed that could barely provide shelter from the wind and rain. His wife, Zhang Gui, carried her child on her back every day to beg for a living. When she could not beg for anything, she went to the wilderness to pick wild vegetables and bring them home to satisfy their hunger. The Chiang Kai-shek Group greatly admired Zhang Gui's tragic story of "begging to support her husband" and praised her as a "model citizen" in the newspaper, causing Zhang Gui to be filled with emotion. She abandoned her disabled husband and young son and committed suicide by taking poison.

    啼饥号寒  求生无路  流浪街头
    台湾十万老弱残疾蒋军被弃
    据新华社19日讯　台北消息：按照美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团拟订的计划，蒋军官兵因老弱残疾而被抛弃的，到去年年底已近十万人。这些被抛弃的蒋军官兵大部分家在大陆，他们在台湾举目无亲，谋生困难，生活非常悲惨。
    台湾报纸说，美国国际合作署台湾分署拨出了一笔“美援专款”交给蒋介石集团，用于对被抛弃的蒋军官兵的“善后计划”。这个利用“美援”推行的所谓“善后计划”，实际是把一大批被剥夺了蒋军军籍的官兵转为廉价劳动力，驱押他们建筑美军基地，开辟军用公路和在有美国资本投资的矿山、农场等处做工。由于物质生活条件很差，劳动强度很大，不少人被折磨死去。
    许多老弱残疾程度更大的蒋军官兵被抛弃后，根据美军顾问团的计划，他们要在台湾“自谋生活”。现在在台北、基隆、高雄、嘉义、台中等地的车站上或马路中，常常可以看到一些身穿破烂军衣、形容枯槁的被抛弃的蒋军官兵，“自谋生活”向路人行乞。还有一些折臂断腿的残废蒋军，或者支着木拐子，或者身边跟着褴褛的年幼儿女，把历年来蒋军当局发给的“军人身份证”、“奖状”、“战功表”等等摆在地上，求行人施舍。
    台湾报纸的社会新闻版上，常常透露一些被抛弃的蒋军官兵的悲惨遭遇。一个原籍山东的蒋军尉级军官韩以亮，在蒋军中因受伤残废被赶出来，流落在台中新社乡盖了一间稍能避风雨的小茅棚居住。他的妻子张桂每天背着孩子行乞养家，乞不到东西时，去荒郊拾野菜回家充饥。蒋介石集团对张桂“行乞养夫”的惨事，竟十分赞赏，在报上把她捧为“模范国民”，使张桂感慨万端，抛下了残废的丈夫和幼子服毒自杀。
