Our country's fruit tree production has also seen continuous leaps forward. During the First Five-Year Plan, the fruit production in 1957 increased by 32.9% compared with 1952. In 1958 alone, fruit production increased by 20.1% compared with 1957. Although many fruit-producing areas suffered from unprecedented floods, droughts, and continuous typhoon attacks in 1959, according to preliminary estimates from several major producing areas, it was still a great leap forward compared to 1958.

After years of continuous increase in fruit tree production, can we make further progress? The answer is yes. The first basis for saying this is that the potential for increasing fruit production is still very large. Before 1957, the yield per mu of large-area high-yield orchards was only two to three thousand catties. In 1959, it reached four to five thousand catties, and even higher yields reached more than nine thousand nine hundred catties. In 1959, the high-yield record for apples was more than 26,000 catties, grapes were more than 27,000 catties, and citrus fruits were also more than 20,000 catties, but their national average yield per mu was only about 1,000 to 1,200 catties. From this, it seems that the leap forward in fruit tree production in the past two years is just the beginning, and even greater harvests are yet to come.

The second basis is the unparalleled superiority of the People's Communes, which greatly facilitates the development of fruit tree production. Fruit tree professional teams or groups have been generally established in various communes, and many communes have also established their own horticultural farms and trained technicians to cultivate fruit trees. These are all good conditions for the rapid development of fruit production. The vast majority of communes have included fruit tree production in the overall production plan and designated special personnel to lead it, which is a powerful guarantee for the continued leap forward in fruit tree production.

Fruit trees are perennial crops. To keep them continuously productive, they must be continuously supplied with sufficient nutrients, and they must be protected from natural disasters, conscientiously implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, protecting flowers and fruits. Fruit trees need to be fertilized in winter and spring to restore tree vigor and promote flower bud formation. Various cold-proof and frost-proof measures must be taken in winter to ensure that fruit trees can safely overwinter. With water conservancy projects, orchards will have irrigation conditions. The heavy work of orchard pruning should also be completed before the fruit trees sprout in the spring.

Doing a good job in the winter and spring management of orchards can not only lay the foundation for obtaining greater harvests, but also alleviate the shortage of labor during the busy spring plowing. Completing the deep plowing, fertilization, and pruning of fruit trees before spring plowing, and preventing and controlling overwintering pests and diseases, will allow most of the labor force to be invested in spring plowing production after the weather warms up and flowers bloom. In this way, the difficulties of taking care of spring plowing and sowing while neglecting fruit tree management, or taking care of fruit trees and delaying spring plowing production, can be overcome.

To tap the potential for increasing fruit tree production, one is to rely on fruit-bearing trees, and the other is to cultivate young trees that are about to bear fruit or have not yet borne fruit. While strengthening the management of large fruit trees, it is also necessary to manage young fruit trees well. Last year and the year before, all communes planted a large number of fruit tree seedlings, and the winter and spring management of young trees is even more important. Young fruit trees are the reserve force for fruit production. Only by continuously cultivating and managing young trees can fruit tree production develop faster and better.

### 果树生产一定能继续大跃进

    果树生产一定能继续大跃进
    我国的果树生产也出现了连续跃进的局面。在第一个五年计划期间，1957年的果品产量比1952年增长了32．9％，而在1958年一年间，果品产量就比1957年增长了20．1％；1959年虽然许多果区遭到多年未有的水、旱灾害和连续的台风侵袭，但据几个主要产区初步预计，比1958年仍然是一个大跃进。
    果树连年增产以后，还能不能百尺竿头再进一步呢？答复是肯定的。这样说的第一个根据是果品的增产潜力还很大。在1957年以前，大面积的丰产园亩产只有两、三千斤，1959年达到四、五千斤，更高有九千九百多斤的。1959年苹果高额丰产纪录是二万六千多斤，葡萄是二万七千多斤，柑桔也在两万斤以上，但它们的全国的平均亩产只有一千到一千二百斤左右。由此看来，这两年来果树生产的跃进，只是初露头角，更大的丰收还在后头。
    第二个根据是人民公社的无比优越性，大大有利于果树生产的发展。各地公社普遍建立了果树专业队或专业组，不少公社还办了自己的园艺场和训练了培育果树的技术员。这些都是果品产量可以迅速发展的良好条件。绝大部分公社把果树生产列入整个生产规划，指定专人领导等等，更是果树生产能够继续跃进的有力保证。
    果树是多年生作物，叫它不断丰产，就必须不断供给它足够的养分，就必须保护它不受自然灾害的侵害，认真贯彻八字宪法，保花、保果。果树在冬春要施基肥，才能恢复树势，促进花芽形成。在冬季要采取各种防寒、防冻措施，果树才能安全越冬。兴修水利，果园才有灌溉条件。繁重的果园整剪工作也要在春季果树发芽以前作完。
    把果园的冬春季管理工作作好，不仅可以为获得更大丰收打下基础，还可以缓和繁忙春耕中的劳力不足情况。在春耕以前将果树的深耕、施肥、修剪作完，将越冬的病虫害防治好，在春暖花开以后，大部劳力就可以投入春耕生产。这样，顾了春耕播种丢了果树管理，顾了果树又耽误春耕生产的困难就可以克服了。
    发掘果树生产的增产潜力，一个是靠结果的大树，另一个是培育将要结果或未结果的小树。在加强对大的果树管理的同时，也一定要把幼小的果树管好。前年和去年，各公社都种植了大量的果树幼苗，对幼树的冬春管理就更加重要了。果树的幼树是果品生产的后备军，只有不断地栽培和管好幼树，果树生产才能发展得更快、更好。
