　　Using Honeycomb Coal for Cooking Saves Coal and Firewood
　　Beijing's 120,000 Users Saved 30,000 Tons of Coal and 30 Million Catties of Firewood Last Year
　　(Our Newspaper News) More than 120,000 households in the capital are now using honeycomb coal for cooking. Facts have proven that burning honeycomb coal saves more coal and firewood than burning coal briquettes, and it is also cleaner and more convenient. According to preliminary statistics, in 1959, Beijing saved more than 30,000 tons of coal and about 30 million catties of firewood in this area.
　　Honeycomb coal is made of pure coal and lime, and its shape is like a honeycomb-like charcoal cake. Because it does not contain a large amount of yellow earth during production, it produces less ash after burning, which can greatly reduce the transportation force of pulling yellow earth into the city and pulling furnace ash out of the city.
　　Once a honeycomb coal stove is lit, as long as coal is added regularly and the opening and closing of the stove door is controlled, there will be fire to use all day long. It does not need to be frequently shaken for ash, added coal, or stirred fire like a coal briquette stove. It is very suitable for users who frequently go to work or go out.
　　Burning a honeycomb coal stove does not require starting a fire every day, nor does it require frequent fire tending and ash shaking, which eliminates the phenomenon of billowing black smoke and flying furnace ash, and also reduces the smoke over the city. In addition, honeycomb coal is easy to store neatly, which is also conducive to household hygiene.
　　When promoting honeycomb coal, Beijing conducted meticulous publicity and organizational work to address residents' ideological concerns. Initially, some residents believed that burning honeycomb coal was technically difficult to master and feared it would delay meals. Others were worried that coal briquette stoves would be difficult to convert. In addition to radio broadcasts, relevant departments in Beijing also held exhibitions to publicize to residents, summarized the experience of converting coal briquette stoves into honeycomb stoves, organized technicians to promote them in residents' homes, and held on-site meetings to demonstrate and impart burning techniques; they also hired residents with experience in burning honeycomb coal to visit and guide neighbors. After the above series of work, residents who originally had ideological concerns also switched to burning honeycomb coal stoves. After listening to the experience introduced by Li Qinglian, a resident of Tianqiao, all 480 households switched to burning honeycomb coal stoves.
　　Relevant commercial and industrial departments in Beijing also paid attention to continuously improving the quality and specifications of honeycomb coal and honeycomb coal stoves during the promotion. In the past, there was only one specification, suitable for families of five or six people. Now it has been increased to three different specifications, which can meet the needs of various types of families. The staff of various honeycomb coal plants in Beijing also carried out technical innovations on the basis of technical proficiency, and created foot-operated fast coal crushing machines, electric hammer coal crushing, and honeycomb coal machines, which greatly improved the production efficiency of honeycomb coal and reduced labor intensity. After repeated research and improvement, workers who manufacture honeycomb coal stoves have also standardized the furnace type of honeycomb coal stoves, and also created a cast iron stove that can be used for both cooking and heating, which has been welcomed by the majority of residents.
　　Now relevant units in Beijing are further promoting the use of honeycomb coal stoves.

### 用蜂窝煤做饭省煤省柴  北京十二万用户去年省煤三万吨，木柴三千万斤

    用蜂窝煤做饭省煤省柴
    北京十二万用户去年省煤三万吨，木柴三千万斤
    本报讯　首都已有十二万多户居民使用蜂窝煤做饭。事实证明，烧用蜂窝煤比烧煤球省煤、省柴，又清洁方便。据初步统计，1959年，北京市在这方面节省的煤炭达三万多吨，木柴三千万斤左右。
    蜂窝煤是由纯煤和石灰制成的，形状像蜂窝一样的炭饼，由于它在制作时没有掺用大量的黄土，燃烧后灰渣少，可以大大减少拉黄土进城和拉炉灰出城的运输力。
    蜂窝煤炉引着后，只要定时加煤，掌握炉门的开闭，就可以整天有火用，不必像煤球炉那样要经常抖灰、添煤、拨火。对经常上班或出门的用户来说，十分相宜。
    烧蜂窝煤炉不需要天天升火，不需要勤通火和抖灰，这样就消除了黑烟滚滚和炉灰飞扬的现象，也减少了城市上空的炊烟。另外，蜂窝煤便于整齐存放，也有利于家庭环境卫生。
    北京市在推广蜂窝煤时，针对居民的思想顾虑，进行了细致的宣传和组织工作。最初有些居民认为烧蜂窝煤技术性强，不好掌握，怕耽误吃饭。也有的耽心煤球炉子不好改装。北京市有关部门除通过电台广播外，还举办展览会向居民进行宣传，总结改煤球炉为蜂窝炉的经验，组织技术人员到居民家庭去推广，召开现场会议，表演传授烧用的技术；还聘请烧用蜂窝煤有经验的居民到街坊四邻访问辅导。经过上述一系列的工作，原来有思想顾虑的居民，也都改烧蜂窝煤炉了。天桥的四百八十户居民听了邻近居民李清莲介绍经验以后，全都改烧了蜂窝煤炉。
    北京市有关商业部门和工业部门，在推广中还注意不断地提高蜂窝煤和蜂窝煤炉的质量和规格。过去只有一种规格，适于五、六口人的家庭使用，现在已增加到三种不同的规格，能满足各种类型的家庭需要。北京市各个生产蜂窝煤场的职工也在技术熟练的基础上开展了技术革新，创造了脚蹬快速砸煤器、电锤砸煤、蜂窝煤机器，大大地提高了蜂窝煤的生产效率，减轻了劳动强度。制造蜂窝煤炉的工人，经过多次反复研究改进，现在也已使蜂窝煤炉炉型定型化，还创造了一种烧饭、取暖两用的铸铁炉，受到了广大居民的欢迎。
    现在北京市有关单位正在进一步推广使用蜂窝煤炉。
