Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, January 11th. Eight agricultural middle schools in Zunyi City, Renhuai, and Meitan County, which are under the jurisdiction of the Zunyi Special District in Guizhou, have recently added nine high school classes in order to better cultivate intermediate technical personnel for agricultural technical transformation.

These agricultural middle schools have a relatively good foundation, with fixed teaching and labor bases, relatively complete teaching equipment, and sufficient teachers. Students' food and learning expenses have long been self-sufficient. In addition to having sufficient agricultural production land, they generally develop diversified operations such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Some also have small factories such as bamboo and wood industries. With large incomes and substantial accumulation, adding one or two high school classes will generally not increase the economic burden of the communes.

The newly added high school classes are still of a part-work, part-study nature, with the aim of training intermediate technical personnel to serve agricultural modernization. In teaching, emphasis is placed on strengthening basic courses such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, as well as basic agricultural knowledge and agricultural technology courses. The schools have very high quality requirements for students. The thirty-eight new students of the Erhe Chemical Middle School of the Hema People's Commune in Renhuai County were all selected from outstanding students with good character and academic performance from thirteen agricultural middle schools in the county. At present, the new students in each school are concentrating on reviewing the courses of the third grade of junior high school, preparing to be able to successfully keep up with the class when the new semester begins.

    更好地培养中等农业技术人材
    贵州八所农业中学增设高中班
    新华社贵阳11日电　贵州遵义专区所属遵义市、仁怀和湄潭县的八所农业中学，在最近增设了九个高中班，以便更好地为农业技术改造培养中等技术人材。
    这些农业中学的基础都比较好，有固定的教学和劳动基地，教学设备较为完善，有足够的师资，学生伙食及学习费用早已自给。它们除拥有足够的农业生产园地外，一般都发展了林、牧、副、渔等多种经营，有的还设有竹、木业等小型工厂，收入大，积累多，增设一、二个高中班，一般都不会增加公社的经济负担。
    新增的高中班仍然为半耕半读性质，以培养为农业现代化服务的中等技术人材为目的。在教学上着重加强基础课中的数、理、化和农业基础知识、农业技术等课程。各校对学生的质量要求很高。仁怀县合马人民公社二合化工中学的三十八名新生，都是从全县十三所农业中学选拔出来的品学兼优的学生。目前各校新生都在集中精力复习初三课程，准备在新的学期开始时能顺利地跟班学习。
