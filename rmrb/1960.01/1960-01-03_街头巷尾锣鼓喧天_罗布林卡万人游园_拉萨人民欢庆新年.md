Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, January 2nd: The people of Lhasa City joyfully celebrated New Year's Day, 1960.

	On New Year's Day, Lhasa's urban area was adorned by its citizens with vibrant colors. Tens of thousands of five-star red flags and colorful banners fluttered from every building. Every household displayed New Year couplets, and slogans expressing gratitude to the Communist Party for bringing a new life were posted throughout the streets and alleys. Throughout the day, the streets echoed with the sounds of drums and gongs, and crowds thronged the area. Lamas from various temples in Lhasa also happily celebrated the first day of the new year.

	Apei Awang Jinmei, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, along with heads of various departments under the Preparatory Committee, paid New Year's greetings to Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet and Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC, and other leaders of the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC at 3:30 PM on January 1st. Zhang Jingwu and others exchanged Hada scarves with them and discussed the tasks for the Tibet region in 1960.

	Dozens of New Year's greeting and good news teams, organized by residents of various districts in Lhasa, lamas from major temples, and various government agencies, schools, and factories, carried portraits of Chairman Mao, held flowers, sang and danced, and went to the leading organs of the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Tibet Military Region, and the Lhasa Municipal Committee of the CPC to offer New Year's congratulations. The good news teams from various agencies and factories reported to the Party the good news that they had victoriously completed and exceeded their 1959 production and construction tasks ahead of schedule, and expressed their determination to continue to exert all their efforts, carry out technological innovations, and make greater achievements in government work and on the production front in 1960. Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet and Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC, and Guo Xilan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC, received these good news teams and New Year's greeting teams, congratulated them on the New Year, and wished everyone even greater unity and progress in the new year, and joint construction of a new Tibet.

	For the first time, vagrants and beggars who had huddled in the streets of Lhasa for generations spent New Year's Day happily in their new homes. Beggar Zaxi, who had spent more than fifty years in tattered tents, had his daughter and son-in-law find jobs with the help of the Military Control Commission, and the family no longer worried about food and clothing. Early yesterday morning, old Zaxi gathered his family around the yak dung stove, shared highland barley wine, and wished Chairman Mao a happy and auspicious New Year.

	Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, January 2nd: More than 10,000 people from Lhasa City held a New Year's garden party in Norbulingka today. Among the poplar trees in Norbulingka, on the grass, and by the small lake, people beat skin drums, played iron stringed instruments, sang newly composed songs, and danced traditional circle dances. Workers, peasants, and handicraftsmen of all ethnic groups gathered together intimately to wish each other "Tashi Delek" (good luck and auspiciousness) in the new year.

	Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet and Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC, and Tibetan Party, government, and military leaders, participated in today's garden party, and they congratulated the masses at the garden party on the New Year.

	Around the stone altar surrounded by pine and cypress trees, Tibetan masses at the garden party enthusiastically watched performances by the famous Tibetan Jue Mu Long Tibetan Opera Troupe. This place, once used by Tibetan big serf owners and high officials for watching operas for pleasure, was today filled with newly settled former beggars, "Lang Sheng" (house slaves), and many former "untouchables." A burst of urgent drum music came from under several large trees. This was the "Emancipation Dance" composed by farmers in the western district of Lhasa. At dawn today, they carried colorful plaques and beat gongs and drums to participate in the garden party. They turned this year's "Great Leap Forward plan" for agricultural production into a song, expressing their determination to do a good job in production and continue to increase grain production this year.

	A song and dance troupe composed of young Tibetan and Hui men and women from Lhasa City was praised by the people. Pairs of gorgeously dressed young men and women performed the "Happiness Tap Dance" for the People's Liberation Army soldiers participating in the garden party, thanking the People's Liberation Army for quelling the rebellion and bringing a bright life to the younger generation in Tibet.

    新华社拉萨2日电　拉萨市人民欢乐地度过了1960年元旦。
    元旦这天，拉萨市区被市民们装饰得五彩缤纷，万面五星红旗和彩旗在各个建筑物上飘扬，家家户户贴上了庆祝新年的对联，大街小巷都张贴了感谢共产党带来新生活的标语。街道上，整天锣鼓喧天，人群熙熙攘攘。拉萨各个寺庙的喇嘛们也愉快地度过了新年第一天。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美和自治区筹委会所属各部门负责人，1日下午三时半向中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武和中共西藏工委的其他领导人拜年，张经武等同他们互献了哈达，并交谈了西藏地区1960年的任务。
    由拉萨各区居民、各大寺庙喇嘛和各机关、学校、厂矿等组织的几十支拜年队和报喜队，也抬着毛主席像，持着鲜花，载歌载舞地纷纷前往中共西藏工委、西藏自治区筹备委员会、西藏军区和中共拉萨市委等领导机关祝贺新年。各机关、厂矿的报喜队，向党报告了他们胜利提前超额完成1959年生产建设任务的喜讯，并表示决心在1960年继续鼓足干劲，开展技术革新，在机关工作和生产战线上做出更大的成绩。中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武和中共西藏工委副书记郭锡兰，接见了这些报喜队和拜年队，祝贺他们新年好，并预祝大家在新的一年中，更加团结进步，共同建设新西藏。
    世世代代踡缩在拉萨街头的流浪人和乞丐，昨天第一次欢乐地在自己的新居度过元旦。曾经在破帐篷里度过了五十多年的乞丐扎西，他的女儿和女婿在军管会的帮助下找到了职业，一家人再也不愁吃穿。昨天一早，老扎西就把家人召集在牛粪火炉旁边，共喝青稞酒，祝毛主席新年吉祥如意。
    据新华社拉萨2日电　拉萨市人民一万多人今天在罗布林卡举行新年游园会。在罗布林卡的白杨林间，草地上，小湖旁，人们敲着皮鼓，拉着铁琴，唱着新编的歌曲，跳着传统的圆圈舞。各族工人、农民和手工业者，亲密地相聚在一起，互祝在新的一年中“扎喜德勒”（吉祥如意）。
    中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武和西藏党、政、军负责人，参加了今天的游园会，他们向游园的群众祝贺新年。
    在松柏围绕的石坛四周，游园的藏族群众兴致勃勃地观看西藏著名的觉木隆藏戏团表演。这个曾经是西藏大农奴主和大官员看戏作乐的地方，今天坐满了新安家的过去的乞丐、“朗生”（家奴）和许多过去的“贱民”。一阵急促的鼓乐声从几棵大树底下传来，这是拉萨西城区农民正在跳他们自编的“翻身舞”。今天天一亮，他们就抬着彩牌，敲锣打鼓地来参加游园会。他们把今年农业生产上的“跃进计划”编成了歌曲，表示一定要搞好生产，使今年的粮食继续增产。
    一支由拉萨市藏、回族青年男女组成的歌舞队，受到人们的赞赏。一对对盛装的青年男女，为参加游园会的人民解放军战士表演“幸福踢踏舞”，感谢解放军平息了叛乱，为西藏青年一代带来了光明的生活。
