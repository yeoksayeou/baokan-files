In the past, there was a custom at the end and beginning of the year called "welcoming the God of Wealth." Since liberation, people have gradually forgotten the ritual of "welcoming the God of Wealth." Without the blessing of the God of Wealth, everyone's lives have been improving like bamboo shoots after breaking ground, growing vigorously. Especially after communization and the Great Leap Forward, the enthusiasm and creativity of farmers have been brought into play, demanding treasures from the mountain gods and grain from the land, moving mountains and seas, summoning wind and rain. What God of Wealth, along with the Jade Emperor, all went bankrupt in the minds of the farmers like sugar pagodas that had been dampened by moisture.

However, this year, there is a God of Wealth that should be welcomed. Not only welcomed, but also well-supported and carefully taken care of. This God of Wealth is the pig. A commune member gave the pig a remarkable title: "Black God of Wealth!" This name is extremely well chosen. The paper gods of wealth that were enshrined in every household in the past enjoyed incense and worship for who knows how many years, but did not bring the farmers the slightest benefit; today's "Black God of Wealth" does not require people to burn incense or kowtow, it eats grass and grows meat on its own, and pulls manure to fertilize the fields, truly attracting "gold and silver treasures rolling in." The Chucun Commune in Mengcheng County, Anhui Province, is known for its poverty; it became wealthy by raising a large number of pigs, transforming from a poor team to a rich team, and becoming famous. Over the past year, the entire brigade raised a total of 4,610 pigs, a sharp increase of three times compared to the 1,100 pigs raised at the end of the previous year, and accumulated 330,000 dan of pig manure, applying 20 dan of pig manure per mu. Last year, the average grain yield per mu was more than 500 jin, an increase of five times compared to before liberation. In their excitement, the commune members sang:

	Black Black God of Wealth, urine is silver, feces are gold;
	Daxing Brigade, reverses its fate in a year.

Anhui had a folk song during the Great Leap Forward: "Manage the sky, manage the earth, manage the immortals." Now is the time for us to properly "manage" the "Black God of Wealth." As the new year begins, let us all beat gongs and clear the way for the "Black God of Wealth," so that the "Black God of Wealth" can "urine silver, poop gold," and "attract wealth and treasure" more and faster for the people and for socialism.

    接“黑财神”
    余锡朋
    过去，在年底年初，有个风俗，就是“接财神”。解放以来，人们对“接财神”的仪式早就开始淡忘起来，没有财神的保佑，大家的日子却过得直像破了土的春笋，一个劲地往上窜。特别是公社化和大跃进以后，农民的干劲和创造力得到了发挥，要山神献宝，要土地交粮，移山造海，呼风唤雨。什么财神爷，连同玉皇大帝，都一古脑儿像受了潮的糖塔一样，在农民的心目中一齐破了产。
    可是，今年，倒有一位财神该接一接。不仅接，还该好好供养，细心照顾。这位财神就是猪。有一位公社社员给猪取了个了不起的称号，叫“黑财神！”这个名字可取得好极了。过去家家户户供奉的纸财神，白白地享受了不知多少年的烧香膜拜，却没有给农民带来一丝半毫的好处；今天的“黑财神”，不要人烧香，不要人下拜，自吃草，自长肉，拉粪肥田，却真好端端的招得个“金银财宝滚进来”。安徽蒙城县有个楚村公社大兴大队，这地方以穷出名；因为大量养猪发了家，由穷队变成了富队，也出了名。一年来全大队共养猪四千六百一十头，比前年年底养猪一千一百头，猛增了三倍，积攒猪粪三十三万担，每亩上猪粪二十担，去年粮食平均亩产五百多斤，比解放前增加了五倍。社员兴奋之余歌唱说：
    黑黑财神，尿银屙金；
    大兴大队，一年翻身。
    安徽在大跃进中有句民歌：“管天管地管神仙”。现在，正是要我们来好好“管”一“管”“黑财神”的时候。新的一年开始了，让我们大家都来为“黑财神”鸣锣开道，叫“黑财神”为人民、为社会主义，来更多更快地“尿银屙金”和“招财进宝。”
