    This automatic cotton stalk peeling machine has a simple structure and costs less than twenty yuan per unit. It can peel more than 4,900 catties of cotton stalk bark per day, increasing work efficiency by 987 times compared to manual peeling. This machine can be driven by power belts, ox carts, or manually.

    棉秆剥皮机
    江西省崇仁县秋溪轧花厂最近试制棉秆皮剥制机成功。
    这种棉秆皮自动剥制机构造简单，每台造价不到二十元，一天可剥棉秆皮四千九百多斤，比人工剥皮提高工效九百八十七倍。这种机器，可用动力带、牛车拉，也可用人力摇。用它剥棉秆皮还可以保证质量。
    棉秆皮是重要工业原料之一，可以用来制造人造丝，制造电缆线，还可以织麻袋、造纸、打绳、编拖鞋、草鞋等等……
