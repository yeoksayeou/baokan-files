At the Wan Jingtang water conservancy construction site in Chengguan Commune, Fuyang County, we saw various advanced water conservancy tools neatly arranged along the riverbank for about two li. These tools, driven by machinery and animal power, each displayed their unique skills: the curtain-style relay soil transport machine, like a coal-mining "combine," rotated continuously; the power pulley ran back and forth on the track transporting soil; the overpass-style automatic soil transport machine and the lift soil transport machine lifted the soil from the riverbed into the air and slid it to both banks. As we were watching these tools turn around, suddenly red light flashed in front of us, and a burst of explosions came, followed by seeing large chunks of frozen soil mixed with gunpowder smoke soaring into the sky. It turned out that they were using gunpowder blasting to replace shovels for loosening the soil. The entire construction site did not see shoulder-carrying baskets or crowded people; the workers skillfully operated various advanced water conservancy tools. Wan Jingtang, the deputy secretary of the construction site's Party general branch, told us that the more than 300 workers on the construction site had more than 280 pieces of advanced tools for digging, loading, transporting, unloading, and pressing, with an average work efficiency of 47 cubic meters per person, and a maximum of 75 cubic meters, creating the highest work efficiency record for water conservancy in the county.

At the Wan Jingtang construction site, with the increasing number of soil transport and unloading tools, there was a contradiction that digging and loading soil could not keep up with transporting and unloading soil. Comrade Wan Jingtang was determined to break through this barrier. He thought about it while walking and sitting. One day, on the road, he saw a child digging tree roots on a hillside, and a large piece of soil collapsed with each dig. He thought, if we dig the soil pit into a steep slope and drive wooden stakes into it to pry the soil, wouldn't that be faster? So he quickly ran back to the construction site, discussed it with the carpenters, and rushed to make some soil-splitting stakes. The workers saw that the soil-splitting stakes could pry more than one cubic meter of soil at a time, and everyone competed to use them. However, after three days of trial use, because manpower was used to drive the stakes, the labor intensity was high, and the time was long, it still could not meet the needs of soil transport. The workers requested to transfer a pile driver. Where could a pile driver come from? Wan Jingtang thought: Can't we use indigenous methods to manufacture it ourselves? He and the technicians drew up a blueprint of the soil-splitting machine according to the principle of the pile driver. After five days and five nights of hard work, a soil-splitting machine was created. This soil-splitting machine only needs one person to operate, and it can split more than one cubic meter of soil in three minutes, and more than 240 cubic meters a day. The workers were so happy that they could not close their mouths.

The soil digging barrier was broken, but the soil loading problem was not yet solved. The workers were sweating profusely, but still could not keep up with the needs of soil transport. Comrade Wan Jingtang, who had achieved the first step of victory, did not stop, he continued to study hard. One night he heard that the Qili River construction site had realized the standardization of soil loading docks, and the work efficiency had increased by more than 20 times. He braved the biting cold wind and went straight to the Qili River construction site. Under the moonlight, he carefully observed the high platform and platform sliding board movable docks, and recorded the structure one by one. When he returned to the construction site, the sky was already dawning. He immediately found the carpenter Du Hongxuan to study the imitation, and within three days, he realized the standardization of soil loading docks, eliminated the phenomenon of wasted work, not only greatly increased the average daily work efficiency, but also greatly reduced the labor intensity.

After the soil loading work efficiency was improved, this construction site also promptly promoted the method of using gunpowder to loosen the soil layer. If there was not enough explosives, they would make their own; from one-eye blasting to multi-eye blasting, they finally maintained the daily work efficiency at more than 47 cubic meters, so that the high-efficiency red flag would always fly.

When the project proceeded to the bottom of the river, the work efficiency decreased significantly. Double-track trolleys, overpass-style automatic soil transport machines, turntable-style dump trucks, etc., could not exert their power due to the large slope and deep riverbed. The workers who originally operated advanced tools had to revert to shoulder-carrying baskets. In order to break through this barrier and maintain the red flag of high efficiency, the construction site party committee held a heroes meeting to mobilize everyone to contribute ideas. At the meeting, the carpenter Chu Kexuan proposed to create a lift soil transport machine suitable for river bottom construction. His suggestion was supported by everyone. That night, he started designing, and the next morning, he drew the sketch. In order to help him solve the manufacturing difficulties, the construction site party committee transferred fifteen carpenters to help him. As a result, Chu Kexuan was even more motivated. Although he had not slept for a day and a night, he did not say he was tired at all, and worked overtime to rush to make it. But when it came to installation and testing the next day, the problem came. It turned out that the lift soil transport machine he designed was to lift the soil from the bottom of the river to a certain height, and then automatically slide to both sides of the river through two lead wires. However, the soil bucket could not be lifted during the test. Everyone found that the four ropes tied to the soil bucket stretched unevenly, and when two ropes were used instead, it also failed. At this time, it was already after 3:00 in the morning. Just as Deputy County Mayor Wang Zhichun arrived at the construction site, he immediately participated in the research and decided to tie the two soil buckets to a triangular frame, using a single rope, one end buckled on the bottom wheel, and the other end tied to the top shaft. After shaking the large wheel, the soil bucket rose sharply in the well frame, and through the top end, the two sides of the triangular frame automatically slid down in two ways. In this way, a lift soil transport machine was finally successfully manufactured.

The lift soil transport machine was successfully manufactured, and the workers were so happy that they jumped up. They installed and put it into battle overnight. According to the results of the appraisal, this tool only needs two people to operate when used at a 60-meter river bottom. It can automatically dump soil and automatically return, and can turn once or twice per minute, with a daily work efficiency of 120 cubic meters. Due to the successful creation of this tool, the entire construction site has always maintained high work efficiency. (Attached picture)

    思想不断革命　工具不断革新    
    ——安徽阜阳县万敬堂治水工地巡礼
    李相仁　李星甫　程在纯
    在阜阳县城关公社万敬堂治水工地，我们看到约有两里路长的河坡上整齐地排列着多种先进治水工具。这些工具在机器和畜力的带动下各显神通：卷帘式接力运土机，像采煤的“康拜因”一样，不停地转动；动力滑车在轨道上来回奔跑运土；天桥式自动运土机和直升运土机，把土从河底吊升在空中向两岸滑去。我们正出神地看着这些工具在转来转去时，突然前面红光闪闪，传来阵阵爆破声，接着看见一大块一大块冻土夹着烟硝直冲上天去，原来他们在用火药爆破代替铁锹松土。整个工地上看不到肩挑筐抬和拥挤的人群，民工们轻巧地操作着各种先进治水工具。工地党总支副书记万敬堂告诉我们，工地上三百多个民工就有挖、装、运、卸、压等先进工具二百八十多件，每人平均工效一直稳定在四十七公方，最高达到七十五公方，创造了全县治水工效最高纪录。
    万敬堂工地在运土、卸土工具与日俱增的情况下，曾出现了挖土装土跟不上运土、卸土的矛盾。万敬堂同志决心要突破这道关口。他走着想，坐着也想。一天他在路上，看到一个小孩子在土坡上扒树根，一扒一大块土塌下来。他想，把土圹挖好陡坡，用木桩打下去撬土，那不是更快吗？于是他很快地跑回工地，和木工们研究后，赶制了一些劈土桩。民工看到劈土桩一次可撬土一方多，个个争着用。可是，试用了三天因为用人力打桩，劳动强度大，时间长，还是不能满足运土的需要。民工要求调部打桩机来。打桩机从哪里来呢？万敬堂想：我们用土办法自己制造不行吗？他便和技术人员一起按照打桩机的原理，绘好劈土机的草图，经过五天五夜的苦战，一架劈土机造成了。这种劈土机只需一人操作，三分钟就可劈土一方多，一天可劈土二百四十多方，民工们乐得合不拢嘴。
    挖土关攻破了，装土问题还未解决。民工们弄得汗流浃背，还是跟不上运土的需要。取得第一步胜利的万敬堂同志并没有歇手，他仍然在继续刻苦钻研。一天夜里他听说七里河工地实现了装土码头化，工效提高二十多倍。他就冒着刺骨的寒风，直奔七里河工地。在月光底下，他详细观察了高站台和平台滑板活码头等，把构造一一记下，回到工地时天已经蒙蒙亮了。他立即找木工杜洪宣共同研究仿制，不到三天便实现了装土码头化，消灭了窝工现象，不仅使平均日工效猛增，而且大大减轻了劳动强度。
    装土工效提高后，这个工地又及时推广了用火药炸松土层的办法。炸药不够就自己配制；由一眼爆破发展到多眼爆破，终于把日工效保持在四十七公方以上，使高工效红旗永远飘扬。
  当工程进行到河底时，工效却显著下降，双轨滑车、天桥式自动运土机、转盘式的斗车等，都因为坡度大、河床深，无法施展威力。原来操作先进工具的民工，不得不恢复肩挑筐抬。为了突破这个关口，保持高工效的红旗，工地党委召开了群英会，发动大家献计献策。会上木工储可宣提出了创制适合河底施工用的直升运土机。他的建议，得到了大家的支持。当天晚上，他就动手设计，第二天早晨便把草图画出来了。工地党委为了帮助他解决制造上的困难，抽调了十五个木工去帮助他。这一来，储可宣劲头更大了。尽管一天一夜没有睡觉，他一点也不说累，连夜动手赶制。但到第二天安装试验时，问题来了。原来他设计的直升运土机，是要从河底把土升到一定高度，然后通过两路铅丝，自动滑到河道两岸。但是，试验时土斗升不上去。大家发现系土斗的四根绳子伸缩不一，改用两根绳子，结果也失败了。这时已是深夜三点多钟了。正好副县长王志纯同志赶到工地，他立即参加研究，决定将两个土斗系在一个三角架上，用一根单绳，一头扣在底轮上，一头又系在顶轴上，摇动大轮以后，土斗在井架里就扶摇直上，通过顶端，两边三角架又自动分两路滑下。这样，一部直升运土机终于制造成功了。
    直升运土机制造成功，民工们个个欢喜得跳起来了。他们连夜安装投入战斗。根据鉴定的结果，这种工具在六十米河底使用时，只需两人操作，能自动倒土又自动返回，每分钟可转一次到两次，每日工效达一百二十公方。由于这部工具创造成功，全工地始终保持了高工效。（附图片）
