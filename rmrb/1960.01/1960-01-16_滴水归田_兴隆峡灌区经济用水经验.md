    Returning Every Drop to the Field
    — Economic Water Use Experience in the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area
    Gansu Daily Reporter
    In the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area of Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, the channel beds are gravel layers, resulting in extremely serious seepage. The amount of water flowing into the channel at the gorge entrance is reduced by 50% by the time it reaches the middle reaches, and 70% by the time it reaches the lower reaches. In the face of severe drought, the channel water even stops flowing midway, making irrigation impossible. Starting in 1953 with lining the channels to prevent seepage, and through reorganizing the channel system, planting crops in concentrated areas, irrigating with fixed quantities, and year-round irrigation, by 1959, the irrigated area had increased from more than 33,000 mu to more than 53,000 mu. Furthermore, they created a new record for improving water utilization—irrigating more than 200,000 mu of land with a single flow rate, and a complete set of irrigation management experiences.
      Lining Channels to Collect Small Streams
    The drought resistance movement of 1953 was a turning point for improving water utilization in the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area. Led by the Yuzhong County Committee of the Communist Party of China, local farmers began lining the channels in that year to solve the seepage problem, which caused the greatest loss of water. By 1957, the entire 13,840-meter-long trunk canal and north-south branch canals of the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area were cement-lined, according to the local characteristics of large slopes and rapid flow. In areas with severe channel seepage, cobblestones and turf protection were used. The lining of the channels directly to the fields reduced the loss of flow in the trunk and branch canals to 1%, and the seepage in the small field channels was only about 5%. Comparing January to June of 1953 and 1957, with the same water volume of 0.17 cubic meters per second, only more than 11,750 mu of land were irrigated in 1953, while 26,325 mu were irrigated in 1957. The result of lining to prevent leakage not only enabled the 9,500 mu of waterlogged land that existed in name only to actually use water, but also expanded the waterlogged land by more than 9,800 mu.
    After the channel seepage problem was solved, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area then focused on collecting small streams to expand water sources. In the autumn of 1958, after the realization of the people's commune, the Chengguan People's Commune, which led the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area, sent a professional team to Xinglong Mountain to collect small streams and increase the water volume. There are many small streams in Xinglong Mountain, but the amount is small and easily seeps away. Some people said: "Stone mountains with soil covering the top, building a channel is like a sieve leaking." The professional team used cobblestone lining and cement caulking methods to lay more than 3,700 meters of small channels between the springs and the main canal, drawing out the water from three gullies. Then, in 1959, the same method was used to build more than 1,000 meters of water diversion channels, intercepting the small streams of Habancha and Xiangshui Gully into the Xinglongxia trunk canal, increasing the flow by 0.06 cubic meters per second. The irrigation efficiency of the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area has thus been improved, and 100 mu of cultivated land can be irrigated more per day and night.
      Adjust Crops for Year-Round Irrigation
    Rain is scarce in spring and summer, but there is plenty of rain in autumn. This is the natural pattern of the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area. However, the crops planted in the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area in the past were not adapted to this situation. The ratio of summer fields to autumn fields was seven to three, resulting in water shortage in summer fields and excessive rainwater in autumn fields.
    Starting in 1956, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area appropriately reduced summer field crops, maintaining a half-and-half ratio of summer and autumn crops, which eased the tension in summer irrigation water use. Later, after research, it was found that the vast majority of summer field areas were planted with spring wheat and beans. The first seedling water for these crops was irrigated around the Grain Rain solar term. Before that, the spring water could not be utilized. However, the winter wheat greening water could be irrigated 20 to 25 days earlier. Therefore, starting in 1957, the winter wheat planting area was gradually expanded, increasing from 5.4% of the total cultivated land area to 16.2%.
    The expansion of the winter wheat area has resulted in staggered sowing periods and irrigation periods for the main crops such as winter wheat, spring wheat, corn, millet, and grain. The water demand periods of various crops and the annual water consumption have reached a new balance. This change in the cultivation system also promoted changes in the irrigation system. The Xinglongxia Irrigation Area originally stopped irrigation after the Beginning of Winter solar term and did not start irrigating seedling water until around the Grain Rain solar term in the second year, so the water volume for five months could not be utilized. After the winter wheat area was expanded, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area completely broke the routine of stopping irrigation at the Beginning of Winter, making full use of the remaining water in autumn to extend the winter irrigation period, and immediately using the ice-melting water to irrigate the winter wheat greening water after the beginning of spring. The stop irrigation time in 1957 was shortened from five months to twenty days. In 1958, an irrigation professional team was established to vigorously promote ice-breaking winter irrigation, and all the idle water for the five months of winter and spring was used to irrigate moisture-preserving water. There was no interruption for a single day. The winter and spring irrigated area totaled 52,600 mu, accounting for 98.6% of the waterlogged area. The ice-breaking winter irrigation area alone was 14,000 mu. In 1959, after further implementing the garden-style cultivation, the irrigated area has reached 50,000 mu from the beginning of winter irrigation to the present. It is estimated that by the Spring Festival of 1960, more than 10,000 mu of irrigated area can be added by using the ice-breaking winter irrigation method. This will guarantee the victory over the spring drought in 1960 and timely spring sowing.
      Floodwater Enters the Fields, Ice and Snow Return to the Fields
    In terms of improving water utilization, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area not only extended the irrigation period and made full use of the remaining water in winter and spring, but also made full use of floodwater during the flood season and ice and snow in winter.
    According to historical data, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area has three to four reliable floods every year, with a flow rate of 500,000 to 600,000 cubic meters, which can irrigate about 8,000 mu of land. Based on this characteristic, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area used channels that can accommodate floodwater in the channel design. Thirteen flood control dams were built along the channels, and 21 flood diversion channels were excavated, so that all the floodwater throughout the year was introduced into the channels for irrigation. In 1959, the area irrigated by floodwater was 8,573 mu.
    Intercepting large flows to expand the irrigated area is one aspect of improving water utilization in the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area; using small amounts of water to prevent drought and resist drought is another aspect. Every winter, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area not only uses water flow to send ice and snow along the channels into the fields during ice-breaking winter irrigation, but also pays attention to the work of carrying ice and sweeping snow. In 1957, 400 mu were irrigated by carrying ice and 800 mu were irrigated by accumulating snow. The crop emergence was no different from that of waterlogged land. In the face of severe drought and reduced water volume, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area also took emergency measures to irrigate as much land as possible with a small amount of water, stipulating that self-flowing irrigation should "irrigate far rather than near," and the cultivated land along the trunk canals, branch canals, and bucket canals should be irrigated by planting and watering point by point. The point planting area in 1957 was 1,400 mu. In 1958, point planting was adopted to ensure that 1,600 mu of crops were sown in a timely manner.
      Complete Channel System, Continuous Garden Plots
    The old channel system of the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area was not only severely leaky and messy, with many small field channels connecting 20 to 30 mu of large cultivated land. The channels were winding, the cultivated land was uneven, and with flooding and serial irrigation, a large amount of water was wasted. The average water consumption per mu was more than 80 cubic meters for each irrigation, and the irrigation efficiency was very low. While renovating the trunk and branch canals, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area also reorganized various small field channels. According to the terrain, the methods of "straightening bends, lining with turf, adding drop structures, and reducing longitudinal slopes" were adopted to divide the area into sections and merge 113 messy small field channels into larger field channels, evenly distributed according to the terrain and connected to each other. In combination with field engineering, ditches and ridges were added, and new water conveyance ditches were built for each plot, forming a systematic irrigation network.
    The field engineering of the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area is closely linked to the reorganization of the channel system, which is accomplished in one go. In 1957, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area eliminated the phenomenon of large-scale flooding of about 10 mu and universally changed to small-scale irrigation. In 1958, after key experiments, the method of "long cultivation and short irrigation" was further promoted: that is, according to the terrain, the cultivated land was arranged into strips of 100 to 150 meters long and 30 to 50 meters wide, eliminating the ridges in the fields to facilitate cultivation. After sowing, the method of adding living ridges was used to separate the strip-shaped cultivated land into small plots of 3 to 5 points each for plot irrigation, which solved the contradiction between cultivation and irrigation.
    After the large-scale garden-style cultivation began, the channel system reorganization project was combined with the implementation of garden-style cultivation. At present, 70% of the cultivated land in the entire irrigation area has implemented "long cultivation and short irrigation," with ridges and channels combined. Where there are ridges, there are channels. Where the channels are on the ridges and the slopes on both sides are gentle, the "white horse mane parting" method is used for irrigation. Where the channels are on the ridges and the land slopes downward, the "phoenix spreading its wings" method is used for irrigation, completely eliminating the phenomenon of flooding and serial irrigation. The average water consumption per mu for each irrigation has been reduced to 55 cubic meters, and the irrigation efficiency has been improved by about 30%.
      Plant by Channel, Use Water Quantitatively
    In the distribution of crop sowing areas, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area has been advocating planting the same crops in concentrated areas according to the channels since 1956 to reduce the loss of channel water "running around the ditches." After the realization of the commune in 1958, the entire irrigation area implemented overall planning and planted crops by channel. Except for individual cash crops, the same crops were generally planted in concentrated areas with agricultural channels as the unit, which not only overcame the waste of labor mobilization in cultivation, but also saved 5% of channel water conveyance waste.
    In terms of water allocation, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area comprehensively plans according to seasons, soil, and crops, and allocates water quantitatively for sequential rotation irrigation. For example, when irrigating the first seedling water for wheat, it is stipulated that the upstream should be irrigated with 50 cubic meters of water per mu, the middle reaches should be irrigated with 55 cubic meters of water per mu, and the downstream should be irrigated with 60 cubic meters of water per mu, according to the thin topsoil layer in the upstream and the large water demand in the downstream. Before each rotation irrigation period, the production teams are consulted to determine the area to be irrigated, the amount of water to be allocated, and the irrigation time, which are implemented according to plan. In order to accurately implement the quantitative water use plan, trapezoidal water measuring weirs and water level rulers are also set up on the channels, and flow charts are also issued to irrigation personnel.
    In the rotation irrigation sequence, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area also flexibly adjusts according to different crops and different seasons. Summer field irrigation is carried out in rotation according to the order of seedling emergence, first downstream and then upstream. Autumn field irrigation is carried out in rotation according to the characteristics of short frost-free periods in the upstream and long frost-free periods in the downstream, first upstream and then downstream. During the ice-breaking winter irrigation period, the method of irrigating the downstream without ice and irrigating the upstream with ice is adopted to shorten the ice-breaking front and expand the winter irrigation area.
      Special Personnel in Charge to Eliminate Waste
    In order to ensure economic water use and completely eliminate water waste, the Chengguan People's Commune established an irrigation management committee to provide unified leadership and plan water use. A year-round irrigation professional team is organized according to the irrigation area to contract out sections and be responsible for the irrigation work in the entire irrigation area. The professional team also implements the system of "fixed personnel, fixed leadership, fixed tasks, fixed time, and fixed quality" to ensure the implementation of the economic water use plan.
    Because this professional team specializes in irrigation all year round, it can carry out the maintenance and renovation of channels at any time, make preparations for irrigation in advance, ensure that water reaches the channels smoothly, that the channels do not leak water, and prevent the occurrence of water running and water leakage. Because the professional team is responsible for irrigation all year round and is familiar with the terrain and soil, it can speed up the flow, irrigate appropriately, save water, and avoid uneven irrigation. During the flood season, it can organize manpower to grab flood and irrigate the land. During the freezing period, it can carry out ice-breaking winter irrigation. It can also summarize irrigation experience from practice at any time and improve irrigation techniques and tools. In addition, the professional team has also established close contact with the production teams, combining with agricultural activities to level the land at any time, which prepares favorable conditions for water saving.
      Key Experiments to Continuously Improve
    The improvement of irrigation utilization rate in the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area is the result of continuous research, continuous struggle, and continuous improvement. In order to further study water use technology and improve water utilization, an economic water use experimental field was established in Dingjiazhuang in 1958 to conduct scientific research on various aspects such as channel layout, crop planting, field measures, and irrigation methods.
    The key experiment in Dingjiazhuang first broke the theory of "reaching the top of economic water use." Originally, many people believed that the water consumption per mu should never be less than 55 cubic meters each time. Dingjiazhuang conducted experiments with the same soil and the same cultivation measures and proved that the crop yield of 55 cubic meters of water per mu each time was the same as that of 47 cubic meters. The yield of the experimental field implementing close planting was still more than 40 catties higher than before when irrigating 47 cubic meters each time. At the same time, the "long cultivation and short irrigation" method was studied in the Dingjiazhuang experimental field, which solved the contradiction between cultivation and irrigation.
    Based on the key experiments, the Xinglongxia Irrigation Area continuously studies economic water use methods and continuously improves the water utilization rate of the entire irrigation area through trial and promotion. They have successively held on-site meetings and short-term training courses in Dingjiazhuang to impart the experience of implementing economic water use and "long cultivation and short irrigation," which has promoted the garden-style cultivation of the entire irrigation area and has generally improved the water utilization rate.

    滴水归田
    ——兴隆峡灌区经济用水经验
    甘肃日报记者
    甘肃榆中县兴隆峡灌区渠道的渠底为砂砾层，渗漏极为严重：从峡口流入渠道的水量，到中游即损耗50％，到下游损耗70％。在旱象严重的情况下，渠水甚至中途断流，无法灌溉。从1953年衬砌渠道防止渗漏开始，经过整理渠系、成片种植、定量灌水、常年灌溉，到1959年，灌溉面积已由三万三千多亩发展到五万三千多亩；并创造了提高水的利用率的最新纪录——一个流量的水灌溉二十多万亩地，和一套完整的灌溉管理经验。
      衬砌渠道　汇集细流
    1953年的防旱抗旱运动是兴隆峡灌区提高水的利用率的转折点。中共榆中县委领导当地农民，在这一年开始衬砌渠道，解决水量损耗最大的渗漏问题。到1957年止，兴隆峡灌区全长一万三千八百四十米的干渠和南北支渠，都按照当地坡度大、流速急的特点，使用了水泥衬砌，在渠道渗漏严重的地段采取了卵石、草皮衬护。经过衬砌的渠道直通地头，使干渠、支渠流量的损耗减少到1％，加上田间小型渠道的渗漏也不过5％左右。以1953年和1957年1月至6月相比，都是零点一七秒公方的同等水量，1953年仅灌地一万一千七百五十多亩，而1957年为二万六千三百二十五亩。衬砌防漏的结果，不仅使原来的九千五百多亩有其名无其实的水地真正用上了水，同时扩大了水地九千八百多亩。
    渠道渗漏问题解决以后，兴隆峡灌区接着就抓汇集细流，扩大水源问题。1958年秋，刚刚实现公社化，领导兴隆峡灌区的城关人民公社就派出专业队，进兴隆山接引细流，增加水量。兴隆山里细流很多，只是量小易渗。有些人说：“石山土盖头，修上渠像筛子漏。”专业队就采用了卵石衬砌、水泥抅缝的办法，在各泉口至大渠间铺修了三千七百多米的小渠，引出了三条沟水。接着又在1959年采用同样的办法，修了一千多米的引水渠，将哈半岔和响水沟的细流截入兴隆峡干渠，增加了零点零六秒公方的流量。兴隆峡灌区的灌溉效率因此又有提高，每昼夜可增灌一百亩耕地。
      调整作物　常年灌溉
    春夏雨缺水少，秋后雨多水足，是兴隆峡灌区的自然规律。但是，以往兴隆峡灌区种植的作物却不能和这种情况相适应，夏田和秋田的比例是夏七秋三，于是形成夏田缺水和秋田雨水过剩的现象。
    从1956年起，兴隆峡灌区适当缩减了夏田作物，保持了夏秋各半比例，夏灌用水紧张情况有了缓和。之后，经过研究，发现夏田面积中绝大部分是春小麦和豆类，这些作物的第一次苗水都在谷雨前后灌溉，在此以前的春水都不能利用，而冬麦返青水却可以提前二十天到二十五天灌溉，便从1957年开始逐渐扩大冬麦播种面积，冬麦播种面积由占总耕地面积的5．4％提高到16．2％。
    冬麦面积的扩大，使得冬麦、春麦、玉米、糜、谷等主要作物的播种期有先有后，灌溉期有迟有早，各类作物的需水期和全年用水量有了新的平衡。这一耕作制度上的变更，同时促进了灌溉制度上的变更。兴隆峡灌区原来也是立冬后就停止灌溉，直到第二年谷雨前后才开始灌苗水，五个月时间的水量都不能利用。冬麦面积扩大以后，兴隆峡灌区就彻底打破了立冬停灌的常规，充分利用秋后余水，延长冬灌期，开春后又立即利用消冰水灌溉冬麦返青水。1957年的停灌时间就从五个月缩短到二十天。1958年又成立灌溉专业队，大力推行打冰冬灌，冬春五个月的闲水全部用于灌溉保墒水，没有一日中断，冬春灌地面积共达五万二千六百亩，占水地面积的98．6％，仅打冰冬灌面积就有一万四千亩。1959年在进一步实行耕作园田化以后，从冬灌开始到现在，灌溉面积已经达到五万亩，预计到1960年春节止，采用打冰冬灌的办法，还能增加灌溉面积一万多亩。这样，将保证1960年战胜春旱，及时春播。
      洪水进地　冰雪归田
    兴隆峡灌区提高水的利用率方面，不仅延长了灌溉期，充分利用了冬春余水，同时也充分利用了洪水期间的洪水和冬季的冰雪。
    根据历年资料，兴隆峡每年都有三次至四次的可靠洪水，流量达五十万公方至六十万公方，可灌地八千亩左右。兴隆峡灌区根据这个特点，一面在渠道设计上采用了清洪两用的渠道，容纳洪水期间的水量，一面沿渠修筑了十三个拦洪坝，开挖二十一条引洪渠，把全年的洪水全部被引入各个渠道，用于灌溉。1959年利用洪水灌溉的面积就有八千五百七十三亩。
    截大流扩大灌溉面积，是兴隆峡灌区提高水的利用率的一个方面；用小水防旱抗旱，又是另一个方面。每年冬天，兴隆峡灌区不仅在打冰冬灌时，利用水流将沿渠冰块和积雪送到地里去，同时注意了背冰扫雪的工作。1957年就背冰灌溉四百亩、积雪灌溉八百亩，作物出苗情况不次于水地。在旱象严重、水量减少的情况下，兴隆峡灌区又采取紧急措施，用小量的水尽可能灌更多的地，规定自流灌溉“浇远不浇近”，沿干渠、支渠、斗渠的耕地一律采用点种点浇的办法灌溉。1957年点种面积是一千四百亩，1958年采取点种办法，保证了一千六百亩作物及时下种。
      渠系成套　园田连片
    兴隆峡灌区旧有的渠道系统既渗漏严重，又零乱不堪，许多田间小型渠道接连着二十亩至三十亩的大块耕地，渠道弯曲，耕地不平，加上漫灌、串灌，水量浪费很大，每亩地平均一次灌水八十方以上，灌溉效率很低。在整修干渠、支渠的同时，兴隆峡对于各种田间小型渠道进行了整理。他们按照地形，采取了“裁弯取直，草皮衬砌，加设跌水，减缓纵坡”的办法，划片分段，将一百一十三条零乱的田间小型渠道，合并为较大的田间渠道，按地形均匀分布，相互连结。并且结合田间工程，增沟加埂，新修了各个地块的输水沟，形成了系统的灌溉网。
    兴隆峡灌区的田间工程是和渠系的整理紧密结合，一气呵成的。1957年，兴隆峡灌区消灭了十亩左右的大块漫灌现象，普遍改为小块灌溉。在1958年，经过重点试验，进一步普遍推行“长耕短浇”，即：按照地势，将耕地整理成一百米至一百五十米长、三十米至五十米宽的带状，取消地里的埂子，便利耕种；下种之后，再采用加活埂的办法，将带状耕地分隔成三分至五分的小畦，分畦灌溉，解决了耕作与灌水的矛盾。
    大搞园田化开始后，整理渠系的工程又和实行耕作园田化结合起来。现在，全灌区70％的耕地已经实行“长耕短浇”，埂渠结合，有埂就有渠。渠在梁上，两边缓坡的地方，实行“白马分鬃”的方式灌溉；渠在坎上，土地下倾的地方，实行“凤凰单展翅”的方式灌溉，彻底消灭了漫灌串灌现象，每亩地一次灌水量平均降低到五十五公方，灌溉效率提高了30％左右。
      因渠种植　定量用水
    在农作物播种面积的分布上，兴隆峡灌区从1956年开始提倡按渠道成片种植同类作物，减少渠水往返“跑沟”的损失。1958年实现公社化以后，全灌区就实行了全面规划，因渠种植，除个别经济作物外，普遍以农渠为单位，成片种植了同类作物，既克服了耕作上劳力调动的浪费，同时节省了5％的渠道输水浪费。
    在水量调配上，兴隆峡灌区按季节、土壤、作物统筹规划，定量配水，依次轮灌。譬如小麦灌第一次苗水，就根据上游表土层薄，下游需水量大的情况，分别规定上游每亩灌水五十公方，中游每亩灌水五十五公方，下游每亩灌水六十公方。每次轮灌期前就与各生产队研究确定应灌面积、配水量和灌溉时间，按照计划执行。为了精确的执行定量用水计划，渠道上还设置了梯形量水堰和水位尺，并给灌溉人员制发了查流表。
    在轮灌顺序上，兴隆峡灌区也根据作物不同、季节不同而灵活调整。夏田灌溉按出苗先后，采取先下游、后上游，进行轮灌；秋田灌水又按上游无霜期短、下游无霜期长的特点，采取先上游、后下游的顺序轮灌；打冰冬灌期间，又采取了无冰灌下游、有冰灌上游的办法，缩短打冰战线，扩大冬灌面积。
      专人负责　杜绝浪费
    为了保证经济用水、彻底杜绝水的浪费，城关人民公社成立了灌溉管理委员会，统一领导，计划用水。并按灌区组织常年灌溉专业队，分段包干，专门负责全灌区的灌溉工作；在专业队又实行了“定人员、定领导、定任务、定时间、定质量”的制度，保证经济用水计划的贯彻执行。
    这支专业队由于常年专管灌溉，能够随时进行渠道的养护和整修，提前作好灌水准备，做到水到渠通，渠不漏水，防止跑水漏水现象的发生。由于专业队常年负责灌溉，熟悉地势、土壤，作到了加快流速，适量灌水，节省水量，避免灌水不匀。在洪水期间，可以组织人力抢洪灌地；在封冻期间，又能突击打冰冬灌。并且能够随时从实践中总结灌溉经验，改进灌溉技术和工具。此外，专业队还与各生产队之间建立了密切的联系，结合农事活动，随时平整土地，为节约用水准备了有利条件。
      重点试验　不断提高
    兴隆峡灌区灌溉利用率的提高，是不断研究、不断斗争、不断改进的结果。为了进一步研究用水技术、提高水的利用率，1958年在丁家庄建立了经济用水试验田，从渠道布置、作物种植、田间措施、灌水方法等各个方面进行科学研究。
    丁家庄的重点试验，首先打破了“经济用水到顶”论。原来许多人认为每亩灌水每次绝不能少于五十五公方，丁家庄在同等土壤采取同等的耕作措施进行了试验，证明每亩灌水每次五十五公方与四十七公方的作物收获量相同，实行密植的试验田在每次灌水四十七公方的情况下，仍然比以往的产量提高了四十多斤。同时，在丁家庄试验田研究出了“长耕短浇”的方法，解决了耕作与灌溉之间的矛盾。
    兴隆峡灌区在重点试验的基础上，不断研究经济用水的方法，并且通过边试验、边推广，不断地提高全灌区的水的利用率。他们先后在丁家庄召开现场会，举办短期训练班，传授实行经济用水和“长耕短浇”的经验，促进了全灌区的耕作园田化，并使水的利用率普遍有了提高。
