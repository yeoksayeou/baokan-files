Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 20th: The workers of the Tuoshi Engineering Section of the Xi'an Railway Bureau, who fight in the dangerous mountain area of the Baoji-Tianshui Railway, have created a relatively complete set of comprehensive mountain management experience. They have basically eliminated the subgrade diseases of the Baoji-Tianshui Railway, turning a dangerous road into a thoroughfare, and providing new methods for preventing subgrade collapses and landslides on mountain railways.

The Baoji-Tianshui Railway runs from Baoji to Tianshui, with a total length of one hundred and thirty kilometers, winding along the mountainside. The geology of the mountains along the line is complex, mostly metamorphic rocks with crisscrossing cracks and severe weathering. In addition, the Kuomintang reactionaries were sloppy in their construction of this railway, so various diseases such as collapses were extremely serious along the line. Before liberation, the Baoji-Tianshui Railway was only open to traffic for a few months a year, becoming a famous "blind gut" of the Longhai Railway. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the workers of the Baoji-Tianshui Railway actively carried out infrastructure construction, major repairs, and maintenance work. In 1956, the Party General Branch of the Tuoshi Engineering Section proposed to the workers the policy of focusing on prevention, combining mountain conservation and mountain treatment to rectify diseases. They adopted methods such as using cement to hold wide cracks and applying a layer of stabilized soil to the broken slopes, which stabilized the mountains and prevented collapses caused by continued weathering of the rocks.

The success of this preventive method of disease management boosted everyone's confidence in fighting against the dangerous mountains. The workers created a variety of rectification methods such as "rubble masonry retaining walls" according to the different characteristics of each mountain and each disease. These methods were gradually formed into a complete set of mountain management experience after being organized, identified, refined, and summarized by the Party General Branch of the Engineering Section.

The workers of the Tuoshi Engineering Section used these experiences they created to launch a large-scale comprehensive mountain management campaign. They filled many mountain gullies that had collapsed with rubble and mortar; mountain tops with the danger of collapse were firmly supported by strong retaining walls; stone slopes that were prone to sliding when exposed to rain were reinforced by inserting or connecting steel rails; more than 15,000 large isolated rocks hanging on the hillside that were about to fall were safely released; and workers planted turf and willows on the soil slopes that were easily eroded by rainwater, looking like a beautiful carpet from a distance.

From 1956 to the present, more than 300 road maintenance workers in this engineering section have rectified 84 dangerous mountains along the Baoji-Tianshui Railway that frequently collapsed and were not easy to rectify, basically eradicating the diseases. The driving speed has increased from more than ten kilometers per hour in the early days of liberation to seventy kilometers per hour.

### 预防为主　养山治山兼施  陇海路“盲肠”变通途

    预防为主　养山治山兼施
    陇海路“盲肠”变通途
    据新华社西安20日电　战斗在宝天铁路险山地带的西安铁路局拓石工务段职工，创造了一套比较完整的综合治山经验。他们基本上消除了宝天路的路基病害，变险路为通途，为防止山区铁路路基塌方、滑坡等病害提供了新的办法。
    宝天路由宝鸡至天水，全长一百三十公里，沿线都在半山腰中迂回。这里山体地质复杂，多半是变质岩石，裂纹纵横交错，风化严重。加上国民党反动派修建这条铁路时工作潦草，因此沿线塌方等各种病害极为严重。在解放前，宝天路一年只有几个月能通车。成了陇海铁路有名的“盲肠”。解放后，宝天路职工在党的领导下，积极进行了基建、大修和养护工作。1956年，拓石工务段党总支向职工提出以预防为主，养山和治山兼施的整治病害的方针，采用水泥拘住较宽的裂缝，在破碎的坡面抹上一层三合土等办法，稳固了山体，防止了因岩石继续风化而造成塌方。
    这种预防病害的办法试验成功后，鼓舞了大家向险山作斗争的信心。职工们针对每座山和每种病害的不同特点，创造了“浆砌片石拥壁”等多种多样的整治办法。这些办法，经过工务段党总支组织群众鉴定、提炼、总结，便逐渐形成了一套完整的治山经验。
    拓石工务段的职工利用他们自己创造的这些经验，展开了大规模的综合治山运动。他们把很多塌过方的山窝子，用片石和灰浆填补起来；一些有坍塌危险的山头，被砌成的坚固拥壁牢牢地顶住；有些遇到雨水就容易滑落的石方，就用钢轨插别或串连的办法加固起来；那些悬在半山坡上摇摇欲坠的许多大孤石，被安全地放掉了一万五千多块；在那些易被雨水冲刷的土山坡上，工人们种上了草皮，栽上了柳树，远远看去活像一块美丽的大地毯。
    从1956年到现在，这个工段的三百多个养路职工已经整治了宝天路沿线八十四座经常塌方，不易整治的险山，基本上根除了病害。行车速度由解放初期的每小时十多公里提高到七十公里。
