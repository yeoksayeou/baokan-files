    Striving Forward
    Wang Pu
    Our country's socialist construction train has been advancing at an extraordinary speed since entering 1960. The good news of many enterprises fulfilling and overfulfilling their plans for the first ten days of January has just been published in the newspapers, and the good news of fulfilling and overfulfilling their plans for the first half of January and for the entire month has followed closely. After winning the "good start," our country's working class is heading towards new goals. Anshan's workers and staff have already put forward a proposal to all brother enterprises across the country on the 15th, calling for a competition to increase steel production by 5.3%, iron by 1.3%, and steel materials by 10% in the first quarter; the workers and staff of Heilongjiang Province are responding to the provincial party committee's call with practical actions—striving to complete the January plan two or three days ahead of schedule and the first quarter plan seven to ten days ahead of schedule; workers and staff in other regions are also striving to move forward, always ahead of time.
    High-speed socialist construction means seizing time. Being ahead of time and striving to fulfill and overfulfill state plans is important at any time, especially in the first quarter. The first quarter is the beginning of the four seasons. Being able to get ahead of time in the first quarter and fulfill and overfulfill the plan can create more and better material and technical conditions for production and construction in the second, third, and fourth quarters, and gain the initiative. This year's first quarter is also different from the first quarters of previous years. In previous years, the first quarter plans of many enterprises generally accounted for only about 20% of the annual plan, while this year, they generally account for about 25%. The first quarter has one day for New Year's Day and three days for the Spring Festival, and February has only twenty-nine days, making it the season with the least actual production time. Since the first quarter can fulfill and overfulfill the state plan ahead of schedule, then the second, third, and fourth quarters, which have more actual production time, have the potential to fulfill ahead of schedule and overfulfill the state plan even more, making it even more certain to fulfill and overfulfill the annual plan ahead of schedule. Therefore, striving to fulfill and overfulfill the first quarter plan ahead of schedule can not only create favorable conditions and gain the initiative for production in the next three quarters, but also set a brilliant example for better fulfilling and overfulfilling the state plan in the next three quarters, and thus lay a reliable foundation for better fulfilling and overfulfilling the annual plan ahead of schedule.
    The situation for striving to fulfill and overfulfill the first quarter plan ahead of schedule is very good. We have already had a good start. We have not only won a "good start" and a "complete success," so that production since the beginning of the year has stabilized at the level of the fourth quarter of last year, but also further overcome the weak links in production. The enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of workers and staff have also been further mobilized. The mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is flourishing, and production and construction are full of a thriving scene. However, this is, after all, just the beginning. To maintain the good situation of stable upward production in the long term, we must continue to exert our efforts, strive for the upstream, and grasp and control firmly from beginning to end. Keep striving forward. At present, the main thing is to seize the time to arrange plans for production after the Spring Festival, prepare sufficient raw materials and materials, repair equipment and tools, and ensure a red end before the Spring Festival and a complete success after the Spring Festival.
    The actual production time in the first quarter is relatively short, and every minute and every second is very precious to us. We must strive forward, make full use of every minute and every second of production time, and let production advance at a high speed on the track of "red every ten days" at all times. In this way, our production speed can always be ahead of time throughout the first quarter.

    向前赶
    王朴
    我国的社会主义建设列车，一进入1960年就以不平常的速度前进着。许多企业提前和超额完成1月上旬计划的捷报，刚刚在报上发表，提前和超额完成1月上半月和1月份计划的捷报，又接踵而来。我国工人阶级在夺取“开门红”之后，又奔向新的目标。鞍山职工已于15日向全国各兄弟企业提出了第一季增产钢5．3％、铁1．3％、钢材10％的竞赛倡议；黑龙江省的职工以实际行动响应省委的号召——争取提前二、三天完成1月份计划和提前七天到十天完成第一季度计划；其他各地职工也正在为永远赶在时间前面而奋勇向前。
    高速度建设社会主义就是要争取时间。赶在时间前面，力争提前和超额完成国家计划，这在任何时候都是重要的，特别在第一季度。第一季度是四季之始。第一季度能够赶在时间前面，能够提前和超额完成计划，就可以给第二、三、四季度的生产和建设创造更多更好的物质技术条件，争得主动。今年第一季度跟往年第一季度还不同。在往年，许多企业的第一季度计划一般只占全年计划的20％左右，而今年，一般都占25％左右。第一季度有一天元旦和三天春节，2月份又只有二十九天，是四季之中实际生产时间最少的。既然第一季度能够提前和超额完成国家计划，那么实际生产时间比较多的第二、三、四季度，就有可能提前更多、超额更多地完成国家计划，提前和超额完成全年计划也就更有把握了。所以，争取提前和超额完成第一季度计划，不仅可以为今后三个季度的生产创造有利条件和争得主动，而且为今后三个季度更好地提前和超额完成国家计划树立了光辉的榜样，也就为更好地提前和超额完成全年计划奠定了可靠的基础。
    争取提前和超额完成第一季度计划的形势很好。我们已经有了一个良好的开端。我们不但夺得了开门红、满堂红，使开年以来的生产稳定在去年第四季度的水平上，而且进一步克服了生产上的薄弱环节，职工群众的积极性和创造性也进一步调动了起来，群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动蓬勃地开展着，生产和建设中充满着一派兴旺景象。然而，这毕竟是开端。要把生产稳定上升的大好形势长期保持下去，还要我们继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，还要我们自始至终抓紧、抓狠。不断地向前赶。在当前，主要是抓紧为春节后生产安排好计划，准备好充足的原料、材料，检修好设备和工具，保证春节前红到底，春节后满堂红。
    第一季度的实际生产时间比较少，每一分钟、每一秒钟对于我们都是很宝贵的。我们要向前赶，把每分每秒的生产时间都充分利用起来，让生产时时刻刻都在“旬旬红”的轨道上高速度前进。这样，我们的生产速度，就能够在第一季度中自始至终都赶在时间的前面。
