This newspaper reports from Chengdu on the 18th: The entire party and all the people of Sichuan Province are mobilized to vigorously promote rapeseed production, taking all possible measures to strive for a greater leap forward in oil production this year.

Sichuan Province is one of the main rapeseed producing areas in China. Since last winter, a vigorous rapeseed production increase campaign has been launched throughout the province. The planting area has expanded from more than four million mu to more than six million mu, sowing and transplanting have been advanced by one to two seasons, most areas have deep plowing to a depth of eight inches to one foot, improved varieties are used, reasonable close planting is implemented, and "Rapeseed Kings" are vigorously cultivated. Many areas have planted "Rapeseed Kings" that greatly exceed the requirement of ten plants per person. Currently, various localities are generally strengthening the mid-term management of rapeseed, the leaves are fertile and the plants are strong, with plant heights of over one foot, and "Rapeseed Kings" reaching two to three feet in height.

In this year's development of rapeseed production, Sichuan Province first vigorously strengthened political and ideological work, established the idea of "equal emphasis on grain and oil," and ensured that the upsurge in rapeseed production in the province was higher than the last.

This year, Sichuan Province regards expanding and planting regular acreage well and mobilizing the whole people to plant "Rapeseed Kings" as the main measures to increase rapeseed production. According to the experience of the past two years, this measure can greatly mobilize the enthusiasm of urban and rural people to increase oil production, fully utilize scattered land such as in front of and behind houses, field edges, barren open spaces, and dams to plant "Rapeseed Kings," and give full play to land potential. Zhongxian County, which pioneered the planting of "Rapeseed Kings," last year planted five plants per person throughout the county, and the rapeseed produced accounted for 32% of the county's total rapeseed production. When the Provincial Party Committee issued the call for each person in the province to plant ten "Rapeseed Kings," a scene of urban and rural areas working together and thousands of households mobilizing immediately appeared throughout the province. Various localities properly arranged land and time, strengthened technical guidance, and solved the supply of seeds, making the movement progress very rapidly. In many places in the Nanchong Special District, "Rapeseed Kings" have been planted on roads, streams, beaches, cemeteries, and courtyards; generally, each person plants dozens to hundreds of plants.

In order to speed up the development of rapeseed, Sichuan localities this year also paid special attention to promoting and learning from the experience of advanced areas and advanced units to promote an all-round leap forward. Even before sowing last year, rapeseed high-yield competitions were widely carried out throughout the province, from collectives to individuals, everyone learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced. Various localities learned from each other and improved together through various methods such as on-site meetings, visits, "studying abroad to learn experience," and "inviting consultants." Many places sent large numbers of cadres to high-yield counties such as Zhongxian and Xindu to study and visit. The six major measures for field management proposed by Xindu, Mianzhu and other counties: ensuring full seedlings and strong seedlings, rational fertilization, furrow irrigation, three cultivations, eliminating pests and diseases, and repeatedly eliminating third-class seedlings, have been rapidly promoted throughout the province.

In strengthening the leadership of rapeseed production, all localities in the province have comprehensively arranged manpower and material resources, divided battle lines, and established field management professional teams. Many main producing areas such as Wenjiang, Wanxian, and Nanchong have also established specialized agencies to lead rapeseed at all levels. Cadres at all levels in rural areas throughout the province plant command fields and command plants (Rapeseed Kings) at all levels to drive technical improvements and spread experience, making the promotion of advanced technology fast and good. After entering field management, various localities also grasped each link closely and meticulously, adhering to the spirit of "managing as soon as planted, managing to the end." Recently, the Provincial Party Committee held an on-site meeting in Xindu, and the entire province immediately launched a new upsurge in rapeseed field management centered on "three nos" (no missing seedlings, no pests and diseases, no third-class seedlings). In Mianyang Special District, 60% of the labor force was mobilized in various localities, and the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels personally went to the front line. After two shock movements, the number of third-class seedlings in the entire district rapidly dropped to below 5%, and rapeseed fields affected by pests and diseases have all been treated. People's communes in Santai County built more than 500 pesticide factories by making use of local conditions and produced more than 600,000 jin of local pesticides. 40,000 mu of rapeseed were universally treated for pests three or four times, and the goal of basically no pests in rapeseed in the county was quickly achieved. Many special districts such as Wenjiang, Neijiang, Yibin, and Luzhou have carried out various forms of competitions, such as backward areas catching up with advanced areas, third-class seedlings catching up with first-class seedlings, plains catching up with mountainous areas, and general fields catching up with high-yield fields, and frequently conduct large-scale inspections and evaluations, checking field by field, conducting field consultations, and prescribing the right medicine. After ten days of shock work, Wenjiang Special District, the largest rapeseed producing area in the province, has now basically achieved "three nos."

### 扩大面积二百万亩　层层种植“指挥田”　精心培育“油菜王”  四川油菜种得多　管得好　长得壮  各地田间管理一丝不苟，力争达到无缺窝、无病虫害、无三类苗

    扩大面积二百万亩　层层种植“指挥田”　精心培育“油菜王”
    四川油菜种得多　管得好　长得壮
    各地田间管理一丝不苟，力争达到无缺窝、无病虫害、无三类苗
    本报成都18日电　四川省全党全民动手，大抓油菜生产，千方百计采取措施，力争今年油料生产有更大的跃进。
    四川省是我国油菜主要产区之一，从去年冬天起，全省油菜增产运动就已蓬勃展开。种植面积从四百多万亩扩大到六百多万亩，播种移栽提早了一个季节到两个季节，大部分深耕八寸到一尺，采用良种，实行合理密植，并大力培植“油菜王”。许多地区种植的“油菜王”大大超过了每人十株的要求。现在各地普遍加强油菜的中期管理，油菜叶肥体壮，株高一尺以上，“油菜王”高达二、三尺。
    四川省各地在今年发展油菜生产中，首先大力加强了政治思想工作，树立了“粮油并重”的思想，保证全省油菜生产热潮一浪高过一浪。
    今年，四川省把扩大、种好正种面积和发动全民大种“油菜王”作为增产油菜的主要措施。根据两年来的经验，这一措施可以大大动员城乡人民增产油料的积极性，充分利用房前屋后、田边地角、荒坪空坝等零星土地大种“油菜王”，发挥土地潜力。首创种“油菜王”的忠县，去年全县每人种了五株，所产菜子相当全县菜籽总产量的32％。当省委发出全省每人种“油菜王”十株的号召后，全省立即出现了城乡齐动手，千家万户总动员的景象。各地妥善安排了土地、时间，加强技术指导，解决了种子的供应，使运动进展十分迅速。南充专区不少地方都在道路、溪沟、海滩、坟坪、院坝种上了“油菜王”；一般每人种植几十株到上百株。
    为了加快油菜发展速度，四川各地今年还特别注意推广和学习先进地区、先进单位的经验，推动全面跃进。还在去年播种前，全省各地就广泛开展了油菜高产竞赛，从集体到个人，个个学先进、赶先进。各地通过现场会、参观访问、“留学取经”、“请顾问”等多种多样方式，相互学习，共同提高。许多地方都派出了大批干部到忠县、新都等高产县学习访问。新都、绵竹等县提出的田间管理六大措施：全苗壮苗、合理施肥、开厢浸灌、中耕三次、消灭病虫害和反复消灭三类苗等，都迅速在全省各地推广。
    在加强油菜生产领导中，全省各地都全面安排了人力、物力，划分战线，建立田间管理专业队。温江、万县、南充等许多主产区还层层建立了领导油菜的专门机构。全省农村各级干部层层种指挥田、指挥株（油菜王），带动改进技术，传播经验，使先进技术的推广又快又好。进入田间管理以后，各地又本着“种下就管，一管到底”的精神，环环抓紧，一丝不苟。最近省委在新都召开了现场会议，全省立即掀起了以“三无”（无缺窝、无病虫害、无三类苗）为中心的油菜田间管理新高潮。绵阳专区各地出动了60％的劳力，各级党委书记亲自上前线，经过两个突击运动，使全区三类苗迅速下降到5％以下，受病虫害的油菜田，已全部得到防治。三台县各人民公社因陋就简建立了五百多个农药厂，生产土农药六十多万斤，四万亩油菜普遍治虫三、四次，很快就实现了油菜基本无虫害县的目标。温江、内江、宜宾、泸州等许多专区，都开展了形式多样的落后区赶先进区、三类苗赶一类苗、平坝赶山区、一般田赶高产田等竞赛，经常进行大检查大评比，逐块检查，田间会诊，对症下药。全省油菜最大产区温江专区经过十天突击，现在已基本上实现“三无”。
