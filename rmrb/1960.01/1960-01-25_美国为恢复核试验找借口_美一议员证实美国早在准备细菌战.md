Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd, Washington Dispatch: The United States is manufacturing excuses for resuming nuclear tests, which have been cursed by people all over the world. According to United Press International on the 20th, quoting American atomic weapons experts, so-called "military necessity will force the United States to resume nuclear weapons testing."

These experts said that there was a point implied in Eisenhower's recent budget message. They pointed out that the budget repeatedly mentioned the "Davy Crockett" rocket, a "rocket capable of carrying nuclear warheads that can closely support troops on the battlefield." US officials said, "The Army desperately needs to test the 'Davy Crockett' rocket in hypothetical battlefield situations."

The report said that the new budget will also allocate funds for "large-scale" testing of "Nike-Zeus" missiles. Authorities said that any realistic test must be carried out with nuclear warheads.

The report also said that the development of the "Polaris" ballistic missile for submarines urgently requires further testing.

Prior to this, the January 11th issue of "Newsweek" stated that the United States' decision not to continue the moratorium on atomic testing caused "relief in the Pentagon, where officials are eager to test at least a dozen new types of atomic weapons."

Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd, Washington Dispatch: For ten years, the United States has been secretly researching bacteriological weapons, preparing for inhumane "biological warfare." This situation has once again been confirmed in a statement issued by Democratic Congressman Kastenmeier in Washington on the 21st.

In his statement, Kastenmeier said that since 1950, research on so-called "biological warfare" has caused two deaths and four hundred and sixty-four illnesses in the United States. He said that both people died from anthrax; a disease of livestock, but which humans can easily contract. Another research subject was the plague.

Kastenmeier pointed out that the anthrax that claimed the lives of these two people was not caused by livestock, but by experiments conducted at the US Chemical Corps "Biological Warfare" headquarters in 1951 and 1958.

Kastenmeier also revealed that in order to keep this sinister research secret, the US authorities falsely claimed that the cause of death of the two people was some form of bronchial pneumonia.

    美国为恢复核试验找借口
    美一议员证实美国早在准备细菌战
    新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：美国正在为恢复遭到全世界各国人民诅咒的核试验制造借口。据合众国际社20日引美国原子武器专家的话说，所谓“军事上的必要性将迫使美国恢复核武器试验”。
    这些专家说，艾森豪威尔最近提出的预算咨文中隐含了一个点。他们指出，预算中一再提到“戴维·克罗克特”火箭，这是一种“可以密切支持战场上的军队的能装核弹头的火箭”。美国官员说，“陆军极其需要在假想的战场情况下试验‘戴维·克罗克特’火箭。”
    消息说，新预算还将拨出一些款项“大规模”试验“奈克—宙斯”式导弹。权威人士说，任何现实的试验都必须用核弹头来进行。
    消息还说，用于潜艇的“北极星式”弹道导弹的发展迫切需要进一步试验。
    在此以前，1月11日的“新闻周刊”说，美国不再继续停止原子试验的决定引起了“五角大楼的轻松，因为那里的官方人士热望至少要试验一打新型原子武器”。
    新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：十年来美国一直在秘密研究细菌武器，准备进行灭绝人性的“生物战”。这一情况在美国民主党众议员卡斯滕迈尔21日在华盛顿发表的一项声明中又一次得到了证实。
    卡斯滕迈尔在声明中说，自从1950年以来，所谓“生物战”的研究已经在美国使两个人死亡，四百六十四人得病。他说，这两个人都死于炭疽病；这是一种牲畜的病，但是人很容易感染上。另外一个研究对象是鼠疫。
    卡斯滕迈尔指出，夺去了这两个人生命的炭疽病并不是由牲畜引起的，而是在1951年和1958年由美国化学兵团“生物战”总部中进行的实验所引起的。
    卡斯滕迈尔还透露，由于要对这种罪恶的研究保密，美国当局伪称这两人的死因是什么支气管肺炎。
