Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th -- The Soviet "Air Force News" today published an article commenting on the U.S. draft budget for the 1961 fiscal year, saying that the U.S. draft budget openly demonstrates that the U.S. imperialist clique is opposed to easing international tensions.

The article said that facts prove that there are still many figures in the United States who are unwilling to take any measures to ease international tensions, and the most telling aspect of this is U.S. Vice President Nixon's call for the West to "under no circumstances reduce its forces."

The article pointed out that it is noteworthy that Nixon's speech, as a spokesman for the arms race, was delivered the day before the budget message. This message put spending on the arms race in the first place, with direct military spending accounting for 57.1% of the total budget, and nearly half of the military spending being used for the air force. A characteristic of the new budget is the increased allocation for the production of intercontinental missiles. The new draft budget also includes a fund to establish armed NATO countries.

The article said that representatives of the U.S. ruling group have repeatedly said that "national welfare should be improved" in the new fiscal year, but facts have proved that further arms race will further increase the tax burden on the working people.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th -- The Soviet "Air Force News" today published a commentary exposing the U.S. continuing activities to expand military bases.

The commentary said that now, the U.S. military bases scattered on foreign territories are the most dangerous hotbeds of the "Cold War." On the one hand, U.S. imperialism continues to expand air force, navy, and rocket bases around the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. On the other hand, it uses bourgeois propaganda organs to tell the Western public that these bases seem to be for "defending" the "free world," and that the establishment of these bases is a "pressing need." However, the Soviet Union's consistent peaceful foreign policy has thoroughly exposed these lying imperialist propagandists one after another.

The commentary said that in the situation of warming international climate, the defenders and apologists of the "position of strength" policy need even more to play tricks and use cunning methods. U.S. newspapers have recently attempted to create the impression that the Pentagon is making some changes to the strategy of overseas bases. For example, the "New York Herald Tribune" asserted in its editorial that the United States will "reduce" its foreign bases in the near future.

The Soviet "Air Force News" pointed out that, however, the talk about "reducing" U.S. military bases in other countries is nothing more than a lie fabricated by bourgeois propagandists, the purpose of which is to confuse everyone's attention in order to fish in troubled waters. In fact, U.S. military authorities have stated unequivocally that they do not intend to reduce the number of overseas military bases.

The commentary said that the United States' constant equipping of overseas military bases with weapons of mass destruction is a growing threat to international security. The vast majority of people in the world support the Soviet Union's peaceful initiative to unilaterally reduce its army by 1.2 million people and the plan for complete and thorough disarmament. Now it is up to the West.

The commentary emphasized that in order to clear the way for easing international tensions, it is necessary to resolutely eliminate U.S. military bases on foreign territories. Military bases are the most dangerous source of the Cold War and a weapon of the bankrupt "position of strength" policy.

    苏联“空军报”评论美国新预算
    美帝国主义集团反对缓和局势
    美国继续扩充国外军事基地威胁国际安全
    实力政策卫士竭力耍弄花招迷乱人们注意
    新华社莫斯科27日电　苏联“空军报”今天发表文章，评论美国1961财政年度的预算草案说，美国的预算草案露骨地说明了美帝国主义集团是反对缓和国际紧张局势的。
    文章说，事实证明，美国还有许多人物不愿意采取任何措施来缓和国际紧张局势，这方面最能说明问题的就是美国副总统尼克松号召西方“在任何情况下都不可减少自己的兵力”的讲话。
    文章指出，值得注意的是，作为军备竞赛代言人的尼克松的这个讲话，正是在预算咨文前一天发表的。这个咨文把军备竞赛的开支提到了第一位，直接军事开支占预算总开支的57．1％，几乎军事开支的一半用在空军方面。新的预算的特点是对生产洲际导弹的拨款增加了，新的预算草案还包括了建立武装北大西洋公约各国的基金。
    文章说，美国统治集团的代表一再说，在新的财政年度中“国民福利要提高”，但事实已经证明，进一步的军备竞赛将更加加重劳动人民的捐税重担。
    新华社莫斯科28日电　苏联“空军报”今天发表评论，揭露美国继续进行扩充军事基地的活动。
    评论说，现在，美国遍设在外国领土上的军事基地是最危险的“冷战”温床，美帝国主义一方面围绕着苏联和其他社会主义国家继续扩充空军、海军和火箭基地，另一方面却借助于资产阶级的宣传机构对西方的公众宣传说，这些基地似乎是为了“保卫”“自由世界”，这些基地的建立有“迫切需要”。但是，苏联一贯奉行的和平外交政策把这些说谎的帝国主义宣传家一个接一个地彻底揭露了。
    评论说，在国际气候转暖的情况下，“实力地位”政策的保卫者和辩护者就更需要耍弄花招和使用狡猾手段。美国报刊最近就企图制造这样的印象：似乎五角大楼对海外基地的战略正在作某些改变。比如，“纽约先驱论坛报”在它的社论中断言，美国在最近的将来将要“缩减”自己的外国基地。
    苏联“空军报”指出，但是，关于“缩减”美国在别国的军事基地的谈论不过是资产阶级宣传家们臆造出来的谎言罢了，其目的是想迷乱大家的注意，以便混水摸鱼。实际上，美国的军事当局完全肯定地说过，他们不打算减少海外军事基地的数目。
    评论说，美国不断用大规模毁灭性武器来装备海外军事基地，这是对于国际安全的日益增长的威胁。世界上绝大多数人拥护苏联单方面裁减军队一百二十万人的和平倡议和全面彻底裁军的计划，现在事情要看西方了。
    评论强调指出，为缓和国际紧张局势扫清道路，必须坚决消除美国在外国领土上的军事基地。军事基地是冷战最危险的根源，是破了产的“实力地位”政策的武器。
