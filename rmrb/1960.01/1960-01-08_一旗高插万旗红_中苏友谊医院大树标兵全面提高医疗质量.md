Setting One Banner High Leads to Ten Thousand Banners Red
Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital Sets Up a Model to Comprehensively Improve Medical Quality

    (Our Report) The Party Committee of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, adopted the method of grasping typical examples and setting up models to promote the continuous deepening of the mass movement of "learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced" and comprehensively learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience throughout the hospital, resulting in a new atmosphere of "everything for the patient" and comprehensively improving medical quality.
    Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the neurosurgery ward took the lead in comprehensively improving medical quality, becoming an advanced model for the entire hospital. After the model was established, the internal medicine party branch took the lead in launching activities to learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, and catch up with the advanced. They also launched a discussion on the topic of "Why can't we catch up with neurosurgery?". Through discussion, everyone clarified that the key was insufficient emphasis on putting politics in command. Therefore, they organized doctors, nurses, and health workers to go to neurosurgery for "counterpart study," earnestly learning their advanced thoughts, work styles, and experiences in routinizing political and ideological work in medical work. After "studying" and comparing, they saw that neurosurgery had no fewer seriously ill patients than internal medicine, and that medical and nursing work was more complex. Some people who originally emphasized conditions and believed that "their work was almost done" and that there was nothing to learn from neurosurgery had a change of mind. They unanimously agreed that neurosurgery's emphasis on putting politics in command was good and were determined to catch up. The head nurse quickly changed the shortcomings of neglecting political work, and the nurses' enthusiasm was greatly enhanced. When they saw more patients, they took the initiative to help the nurses on duty with nursing work, vying to cooperate with doctors in rescuing patients. At this time, the neurosurgery party branch further strengthened political and ideological work, helping all medical staff to establish the idea of continuous revolution and promptly resolving the slack mood and thought of some people that "work has reached its peak", and newer scenes appeared at work. In the past, some patients suffered from pain for a long time, were in a bad mood, and even lost confidence in life, but medical staff always felt helpless about this. This time, all medical staff were determined to break through this barrier, trying every means to help patients recover their health faster. They put forward the slogan of "Politics enters the wards," and formed groups to read newspapers, talk with patients, and tell revolutionary hero stories to help patients establish revolutionary optimism and a strong will to fight against diseases, and help patients strengthen necessary exercise. In this way, many patients gained confidence, and their health recovery made significant progress. Some patients were so moved that they wrote poems praising the medical staff.
    After discovering the advanced examples of internal medicine and neurosurgery putting politics in command and changing medical attitudes, the hospital party committee went into the departments to summarize this experience and immediately held an on-site meeting to promote it, so that a new situation of mutual cooperation and comprehensive improvement of medical quality appeared in the hospital. Doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians, and service personnel in various departments further improved their medical attitudes and considered patients everywhere. For example, the pediatrics department came up with various ways to divert sick children's attention so that they would cry less or not cry when getting injections. Doctors in the surgical outpatient clinic discovered that a sick child, Tong Xier, still had a dangerous condition but did not come back for a follow-up visit as scheduled. After inquiry, they learned that the child had been taken back to his hometown by his father. They immediately sent medical staff with a first-aid kit to the child's home overnight to treat him. One night, four emergency patients came to the surgical operating room. In order to reduce the pain of the patients, the medical staff decided to work through the night and perform four operations simultaneously. However, there were only the staff on duty for one operation. After hearing about this, the doctors and nurses who were not on duty automatically got up to support them, so that the four operations were carried out smoothly, and the patients received timely treatment and were out of danger.
    In this movement, many medical staff launched a wave of learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience. Many doctors formulated plans to strengthen the comprehensive learning of the Soviet Union's advanced medical experience and medical style. Some doctors who came to this hospital from various places for further studies also formulated study plans, determined to spread the Soviet Union's advanced experience to all parts of the country. With the selfless help of Soviet experts, many doctors used the Soviet Union's advanced experience to promote the rapid improvement of medical quality. Doctors in the dermatology outpatient clinic used to think that diseases such as carbuncle and furuncle, dermatitis, and pyoderma were chronic diseases that could not be cured; now that they have put politics in command and actively learned from the Soviet Union's advanced experience, they have cured more than twenty patients. In the past, it generally took more than half a year for the neurology department to treat patients with paralyzed myeloradiculitis or polyradiculitis before they could walk on the ground; now, after the doctors seriously and comprehensively learned the Soviet Union's advanced new therapies, patients can walk on the ground after more than a month of diagnosis and treatment. Many doctors are summarizing the experience of learning from the Soviet Union's advanced treatment, translating medical works by Soviet experts, and learning from the Soviet Union's latest medical literature and medical style in order to better serve patients.
    The hospital party committee mobilized all units to grasp the establishment of necessary systems as a link to consolidate and develop the achievements already made. Various departments have formulated a regular evaluation system. The case histories written by doctors in the departments of internal medicine, neurosurgery, etc. are all set to a set of specifications, requiring them to be scientific, neat, comprehensive, and systematic, correcting the past view of partial diagnosis of patients. The surgical operating room has established a doctor-nurse cooperation system, exchanging opinions before and after the operation to improve the quality of the operation. The internal medicine ward has summarized a set of experiences for the nursing work of seriously ill patients and patients with ulcers, and has developed different nursing routines. The pediatric infant room treats the infant's lying position, turning over, prevention of diaper rash, etc. as systems to be implemented to ensure the quality of care and the health of newborns.

    一旗高插万旗红
    中苏友谊医院大树标兵全面提高医疗质量
    本报讯　北京市中苏友谊医院党委坚持政治挂帅，采取抓典型树标兵、以点带面的方法，推动全院“学先进、比先进、赶先进”和全面学习苏联先进经验的群众运动不断深入，出现了“一切为病人”，全面提高医疗质量的新气象。
    在党委发动下，神经外科病房首先做到全面提高医疗质量，成为全院的先进标兵。标兵树起后，内科党支部首先开展起学先进、比先进、赶先进的活动。并以“为什么赶不上神经外科”为题，展开了讨论。经过讨论，大家明确了关键在于政治挂帅不够。于是，他们就组织医生、护士、卫生员，到神经外科去“对口留学”，认真学习他们在医疗工作中政治思想工作经常化等先进思想、作风和经验。经过“留学”对比，看到神经外科比内科重病人并不少，而且医疗护理工作更复杂，有些原来强调条件、认为“自己工作差不多了”、神经外科没有什么可学的人，思想有了转变。他们一致认为神经外科政治挂帅就是好，立志要赶上去。护士长很快改变了忽视政治工作的缺点，护士们的积极性也大为提高。她们见到病人多了，就主动地帮助值班护士作护理工作，争着配合医生抢救病人。这时，神经外科党支部又进一步加强政治思想工作，帮助全科医务人员树立不断革命的思想，及时解决了某些人“工作到了顶”和松劲情绪，工作上出现了更新的景象。过去，有些病人长期经受病痛折磨，心情不好甚至失去生活信心，但医护人员对此总觉得爱莫能助。这次全科医护人员下决心要突破这一关，想尽办法使病人加速恢复健康。他们提出了“政治下病房”的口号，分别组成小组给病人读报、谈心、讲革命英雄故事，帮助病人树立革命乐观主义思想和向疾病作斗争的坚强意志，并帮助病人加强必要的锻炼。这样许多病人增强了信心，健康恢复有了显著进展。有的病人感动得写下了赞扬医护人员的诗篇。
    医院党委发现内科和神经外科政治挂帅，改变医疗态度的先进事例后，他们深入科室总结了这一经验，并立即召开现场会推广，使全院出现了相互协作全面提高医疗质量的崭新局面。各科室的医生、护士、化验员和服务员，都进一步改进了医疗态度，处处为病人着想。如小儿科想出了转移病儿注意力的各种办法，使病儿打针时不哭或少哭。外科门诊的大夫发现病儿佟喜儿还存有危险，但没按期来复诊。经过查问，才知道病儿已由父亲带回家乡。他们立即派医护人员带着急救箱，连夜赶到病儿的家里治疗。一天夜里，外科手术室来了四个急诊患者，医护人员为了减轻病人痛苦，决定大干通宵同时进行四台手术。但是，只有作一台手术的值班人员。不值班的医生和护士听说后，就自动起来支援，使四台手术顺利进行，患者得到及时治疗，转危为安。
    许多医护人员在这次运动中，掀起了学习苏联先进经验的热潮。许多大夫制订了加强全面学习苏联的先进医疗经验和医疗作风的规划。从各地来到这个医院进修的一些医生也制定了学习计划，立志要把苏联先进经验传播到全国各地。许多医生在苏联专家的无私帮助下，运用苏联先进经验，促进医疗质量迅速提高。皮科门诊的医生，过去一向认为甲?、皮炎脓皮病等疾病，是久治不愈之症；现在他们政治挂了帅，积极学习苏联先进经验后，便治愈了二十多个病人。过去，神经内科治疗脊髓神经根炎或多发性神经根炎瘫痪病、一般要用半年多的时间，病人才能下地行走；现在医生们认真又全面地学习了苏联先进的新疗法后，经过一个多月的诊治，病人就能下地行走了。许多医生正总结学习苏联先进的治疗经验，翻译苏联专家的医学著作，学习苏联最新的医学文献和医疗作风，以便更好地为病人服务。
    这个医院的党委发动各单位抓住建立必要制度这一环，巩固并发展已取得的成绩。各科室已制订了定期评比制度。内科、神经外科等科医生们写的病例都订出一套规格，要求既科学、整洁，又全面、系统，纠正过去对病人局部诊断的观点。外科手术室建立了医护配合制度，手术前后都交换意见，以提高手术质量。内科病房对重病人、溃疡病人的护理工作，已总结了一套经验，研究出不同的护理常规。小儿科婴儿室对婴儿卧位、翻身、防臀红等，都作为制度来执行，保证护理质量和新生儿的健康。（附图片）
