    The year 1960 has just begun, and a production upsurge of "good start, all-round red, and red to the end" has already boiled up across the country. Thousands of enterprises are overfulfilling their production tasks daily, weekly, and every ten days, and production records are maintained at the level of the fourth quarter of last year, breaking the old rule of declining production at the beginning of the year that has existed for many years. What is particularly gratifying and worth celebrating is that this "good start" increase production and practice economy movement is a mass movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. This year, the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel, the steel capital, have launched a more extensive and in-depth technical innovation movement than last year. Starting from New Year's Day, they held a joint technical performance competition week. In just seven short days, more than 4,740 technical innovation proposals and advanced experiences emerged, of which 748 sets of advanced experiences have been matched; in this new upsurge of technical innovation, more than 3,800 key production problems were solved in seven days, more than 120 new records were created, and more than 18,000 advanced individuals and more than 2,400 advanced collectives emerged. Harbin held a "production sports meeting." During various technical competitions, employees also put forward more than 70,000 technical innovation proposals in one week. Such exciting examples exist throughout the country, and the technical innovation movement on the agricultural front has also undergone new developments. This new situation of technical innovation and technical revolution on the industrial and agricultural fronts is not only an important guarantee for this year's "good start" and "all-round red" but also an important guarantee for this year's "red to the end."
    The continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 enabled us to take a big step on the road of technical revolution. In 1959 alone, employees on the industrial, transportation, capital construction, and financial and trade fronts put forward about 40 million rationalization proposals and inventions, an increase of more than 14 million over 1958, of which more than 18 million have been implemented. In this year, more than 200 million new and improved farm tools were promoted on the agricultural front. With the extensive and in-depth development of the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the labor productivity of employees has been further improved. However, we are not satisfied with the tremendous achievements already made in technical innovation and technical revolution. Compared with the grand goals of our technical revolution, all this is just the beginning. We know that vigorously promoting technical innovation and technical revolution and improving labor productivity are the main contents of the mass movement to increase production and practice economy, and are increasingly important tasks in China's socialist construction. Because only by carrying out a more extensive and in-depth mass movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution can we complete and overfulfill this year's continued leap forward national economic plan, and strive to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major industrial products within ten years, realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and basically realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, science and culture, thereby building our country into a strong socialist country.
    What is decisive for achieving this grand goal is that the Chinese people have firm beliefs and soaring enthusiasm. Wang Linhe, a 29-year-old worker at the Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory, a small factory in a Shanghai alley, with only a junior high school education, after 371 tenacious experiments, finally conquered this cutting-edge technology with his indomitable enthusiasm and created an advanced precision product he had never seen before - a 10,000-volt high-voltage bridge. This is an outstanding representative of the Chinese people's soaring enthusiasm. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the people is the most active factor in productivity. The essence of the Party's general line for socialist construction is to mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of people in the cause of socialist construction to the fullest extent. The entire set of "walking on two legs" policies and the entire set of working methods that link the masses and link with reality stipulated by the general line are all for the purpose of better mobilizing and organizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people. When the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people is fully mobilized, the problem lies in guiding it to the direction that is decisive for the development of production. Everyone knows that the history of production, in the final analysis, is the history of producers constantly creating higher labor productivity with new production technologies, replacing old production technologies, and surpassing old labor productivity. Without the continuous innovation of production technology, there would be no continuous improvement of labor productivity, and there would be no continuous development of production and continuous progress of society. Moreover, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people cannot be consolidated and sustained if it is not combined with technical innovation and technical revolution. The continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 proved that vigorously promoting technical innovation and technical revolution, combining the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of people with technical innovation, and combining the spirit of hard work, the style of practical work, and the method of skillful work can realize the sustained and high-speed development of the national economy.
    In the years to come, relying mainly on technical innovation and technical revolution to realize the continuous leap forward of production is not only very necessary but also has extremely huge potential. Since the founding of the country, especially since the Great Leap Forward, although China's technical level has been greatly improved, its backward traces have not yet been completely eliminated due to the very weak technical foundation left over from old China. According to a recent survey of five cities, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Taiyuan, and Chengdu, the number of workers engaged in mechanized and semi-mechanized labor generally accounts for less than half of the total number of workers; while workers engaged in manual labor still account for more than 50% of the total number of workers. Shanghai and other five major cities are all places with relatively high industrial levels in our country, and there are still so many workers who have not been liberated from manual operation, so it is even more conceivable in other places.
    In rural areas, we only have more than 50,000 tractors, and agricultural production basically relies on manual tools.
    Faced with such a backward technical situation, there can be two completely different attitudes. One is to shrink back in the face of backwardness, which is certainly not the attitude we should adopt. The other is to regard this backward situation as a huge source of production potential, because it precisely shows that there is huge potential for vigorously promoting technical innovation and technical revolution. As long as we make slight innovations in production tools and operating methods, labor efficiency can be multiplied. For example, in terms of loading and unloading labor, most of it is still manual operation. The loading and unloading work at Luzhou Port in Sichuan was completely manual before June last year, with a total of 2,630 stevedores. Because of the low efficiency, it could not meet the requirements of the port, and it was once believed that it was necessary to add 3,000 people to meet the needs. After June, due to the realization of mechanized loading and unloading, the efficiency increased two-fold. Not only were the 3,000 people originally needed not added, but the original number of people was reduced by more than 1,100. In "small modern" enterprises that already have some modern equipment, the potential for technical innovation is also very huge. The Shalingzi Iron and Steel Plant in Hebei Province, its No. 6 blast furnace with a volume of 13 cubic meters, due to general technical innovations such as connecting fans in parallel and increasing the diameter of the air duct to increase the air volume, on January 4, the utilization coefficient per cubic meter exceeded 10 tons, the coke ratio reached 0.7, and the quality qualified rate reached 90%, greatly exceeding the productivity of general small blast furnaces. Does the huge potential also exist in those large-scale modern enterprises? The answer is also yes. The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant is a brand new modern large factory. In the fourth quarter of 1959, the employees of this factory vigorously carried out technical innovations, connecting various machines for processing taps, which were originally operated separately, into an automatic production line with a conveyor belt. As a result, the number of production workers was reduced from seven to two, but the output increased by more than seven times, and labor efficiency increased by twelve times. All this shows that in order to realize the continued leap forward, we must put vigorously promoting technical innovation and technical revolution and improving labor productivity in a more important position. Only in this way can we not only overcome the difficulties of labor shortage and insufficient certain raw materials and certain equipment, but more importantly, we can guarantee to increase production more, faster, better, and more economically. Therefore, this year, we must begin to equip agriculture with modern technology on a large scale, continue to build various modern enterprises, accelerate the technical transformation of existing enterprises, improve the technical level of "small modern" enterprises and the front, rear, left, and right links related to them, produce more products with the latest technical achievements, and carry out tool reforms and technical innovations more extensively to generally improve labor productivity. Such a more extensive and more in-depth mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution has an urgent practical significance for realizing a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward in the national economy this year; and from a long-term perspective, it is also of great significance for completing the great task of technical revolution and building our country into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.
    In the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, there must be the spirit of daring to think and act to climb the latest technical peaks. With the development of our country's production and construction cause, mastering the most advanced technical achievements is becoming an increasingly important issue in the continued leap forward. Our country's material and technical strength is much stronger than in the past, and the conditions for mastering the most advanced technical achievements are also much more favorable than in the past. We must master all the latest technologies in the world that others have already mastered, and we must also strive to study the latest technical topics that others have not yet solved. Without such great ambition, it is impossible to fundamentally change the backward state of our country. At the same time, we should also continue to vigorously promote various excellent simple technologies. Many good simple technologies and local methods do not seem to improve efficiency very much, but they have the advantage of being able to be quickly and universally promoted. We are a large country with a very backward production technology, and even the promotion of simple technologies and local methods that can only improve efficiency by a few percent or a few tens of percent has huge economic value. Moreover, many simple technologies and local methods can also increase production several times. This has been particularly evident in the mass movement of great steelmaking and in the mass movement of tool reform in water conservancy construction and agricultural production.
    In the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership and pay attention to combining technology and politics. Politics is the commander, is the soul. As long as political work is relaxed even a little, technical work will definitely go astray. Is it daring to think and dare to do, or is it afraid of everything; is it actively supporting advanced emerging things, or is it despising it, hindering it, and pouring cold water on it; is it relying on the broad masses, or is it relying on a few people; is it combining with production practice, or is it deviating from production needs; is it only grasping large and modern technologies, or is it grasping large, medium, and small sizes together, and combining modern and indigenous methods; is it excluding other people's advanced experiences, or is it learning from other people's advanced experiences; these major issues are all issues of political thought. If politics is not in command, and these ideological problems are not solved, the development of the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution will be hindered. Therefore, in the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, the most important thing is to implement political command and strengthen the Party's leadership.
    The great task of 1960 is calling! Let us hold high the red flag of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of continuous revolution, follow the road of technical innovation and technical revolution, strive to realize the continued leap forward in 1960, and stride forward towards the great goals of the 1960s!

    沿着技术革新和技术革命的道路继续跃进
    1960年刚刚开始，一个“开门红、全面红、红到底”的生产热潮已经在全国各地沸腾起来。千万个企业按日按周按旬地超额完成生产任务，生产纪录都保持在去年四季度的水平线上，多少年来年初生产下降的老规律开始被打破了。特别值得可喜可庆的是这个开门红的增产节约运动是一个以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动。今年钢都鞍山的工人同志们就展开了比去年更广泛更深入的技术革新运动，从元旦开始举行了一个联合技术表演赛周，仅在短短的七天当中，就涌现了四千七百四十多项技术革新建议和先进经验，其中已经配成套的先进经验，就有七百四十八套；在这个新的技术革新高潮中，七天就解决了各项生产关键问题三千八百多个，创造了新纪录一百二十多次，出现了一万八千多个先进人物和二千四百多个先进集体。哈尔滨举行了“生产运动会”，职工们在各项技术比赛中，一周中也提出了技术革新的建议七万多件。这样的振奋人心的事例，全国各地都有，农业战线上的技术革新运动也有了崭新的发展。工农业战线上这种技术革新和技术革命的新形势，不只是今年开门红和全面红的重要保证，而且是今年红到底的重要保证。
    1958年和1959年的连续大跃进，使我们在技术革命的道路上迈出了很大的一步。仅1959年，工业、交通运输、基本建设和财贸战线上的职工，提出的合理化建议和发明创造就约有四千万件，比1958年增加了一千四百多万件，其中已经实施的约有一千八百多万件。这一年，农业战线上推广的新式农具和改良农具也达二亿多件。随着群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动的广泛深入开展，职工的劳动生产率进一步提高了。但是我们并不满足于技术革新和技术革命方面已经取得的巨大成就。同我们技术革命的远大目标比较起来，这一切都只是开始。我们知道，大搞技术革新和技术革命，提高劳动生产率，是增产节约的群众运动的主要内容，是我国社会主义建设中愈来愈重要的任务。因为只有更广泛更深入地开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，才能够完成和超额完成今年继续跃进的国民经济计划，并且争取在十年的时间内，在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，提前实现全国农业发展纲要，基本上实现工业、农业和科学文化的现代化，从而把我国建成一个强大的社会主义国家。
    对于实现这一远大的目标有决定意义的是，我国人民有着坚强的信念和冲天的干劲。上海一个弄堂小工厂——沪光科学仪器厂的二十九岁的工人王林鹤，只有初中文化程度，经过三百七十一次的顽强试验，就凭他这种百折不挠的干劲，终于攻下了这项尖端技术，制成了自己从来没有看见过的、高级的精密产品——一万伏的高压电桥。这就是我国人民冲天干劲的优秀代表。人民群众的革命干劲是生产力的最积极的因素。党的社会主义建设总路线的本质，就是最充分地调动广大人民群众在建设社会主义事业中的积极性和创造性。总路线所规定的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针以及一整套联系群众、联系实际的工作方法，都是为了更好地把人民群众的革命干劲充分动员和组织起来。当人民群众的革命干劲充分动员起来以后，问题就在于把它引导到对于发展生产具有决定意义的方向上去。大家知道，生产的历史，归根到底，是生产者不断用新的生产技术创造更高的劳动生产率，代替旧的生产技术、超过旧的劳动生产率的历史。没有生产技术的不断革新，就没有劳动生产率的不断提高，也就没有生产的不断发展和社会的不断进步。而且，人民群众的革命干劲如果不同技术革新和技术革命结合起来，是不能巩固和持久的。1958年和1959年连续两年的大跃进，都证明大搞技术革新和技术革命，把广大人民群众的革命干劲和技术革新结合起来，把苦干的精神、实干的作风和巧干的办法结合起来，就能够实现国民经济的持续的高速度的发展。
    在今后的年代里，主要依靠技术革新和技术革命来实现生产的连续跃进，不仅十分必要，并且有着极为巨大的潜力。建国以来，特别是大跃进以来，我国的技术水平虽然有了很大的提高，但是由于旧中国遗留下来的技术基础十分薄弱，它的落后痕迹迄今还没有完全消除。据上海、天津、沈阳、太原、成都五个城市最近的调查，工人从事机械化、半机械化劳动的人数，一般不到工人总数的一半；而从事手工劳动的工人还占工人总数50％以上。上海等五大城市都是我国工业水平比较高的地方，那里尚且有这么多的工人没有从手工操作中解放出来，别的地方就更可想而知。
    在农村里，我们还只有五万多台拖拉机，农业生产基本上依靠的是手工工具。
    面对着这样的技术落后的状况，可以有两种截然不同的态度。一种是在落后的面前畏缩不前，这当然不是我们应当采取的态度。另一种是把这种落后状况看作是生产潜力的巨大源泉，因为它恰恰说明大搞技术革新和技术革命有着巨大的潜力。只要我们在生产工具和操作方法上稍加革新，劳动效率就能成倍地提高。比如在装卸劳动方面，现在大多数还是手工操作。四川泸州港的装卸工作，在去年6月以前，完全用手工操作，共用装卸工二千六百三十人，因为效率低，不能适应港口要求，曾认为必须增加三千人才能满足需要。6月以后由于实现了装卸的土机械化，效率一下提高了两倍。原来需要增加的三千人不仅一个也没有增加，原有的人反而减少了一千一百多人。在已经有了一些现代装备的“小洋”企业里，技术革新的潜力也是十分巨大。河北省沙岭子炼铁厂，它的十三立方米的六号高炉，由于进行了风机并联、加大风管道直径以增加风量等一般性的技术革新，1月4日每立方米的利用系数就突破了十吨，焦比达到零点七，质量合格率达到90％，大大超过了一般小高炉的生产率。在那些大型的现代化企业中是不是也存在着巨大的潜力呢？回答也是肯定的。哈尔滨量具刃具厂是一个全新的现代化的大工厂。1959年第四季度这个厂的职工大搞技术革新，把原来分开操作的、加工丝锥的各种机器，用传送带联结成一条生产自动线，结果生产工人从七人减少到两人，产量却提高了七倍多，劳动效率提高了十二倍。这一切都说明，为了实现继续跃进，就必须把大搞技术革新和技术革命，把提高劳动生产率，放到更加重要的位置上来。只有这样，才不仅可以克服劳动力不足以及某些原材料和某些设备不够的困难，而且更重要的，是可以保证更多更快更好更省地提高生产。因此，今年，我们要开始大规模地用现代技术去装备农业，要继续建设各种现代化企业，要加速对原有企业的技术改造，要提高“小洋”企业和与其有关的前后左右各个环节的技术水平，要生产更多具有最新技术成就的产品，并且要更加广泛地开展工具改革和技术革新，普遍地提高劳动生产率。这样一个更加广泛、更加深入的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，对于实现今年国民经济更好更全面的继续跃进，具有迫切的现实意义；而且从长远看来，它对于完成技术革命的伟大任务，把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家，也是具有十分重大的意义。
    在技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中，要有攀登最新技术高峰的敢想敢做的精神。随着我国生产建设事业的发展，掌握最先进的技术成就愈来愈成为继续跃进中的重要问题。我们国家的物质力量和技术力量都比过去强大多了，掌握最先进的技术成就的条件也比过去有利多了。我们一定要掌握世界上一切别人已经掌握了的最新技术，也要努力去研究别人还没有解决的最新技术的课题。没有这样的雄心大志，就不可能根本改变我们国家的落后面貌。同时，我们也应当继续大力推行各项优良的简易技术。很多好的简易技术和土办法，看起来提高效率并不很大，但它却有着能够迅速普遍推广的长处。我们是一个生产技术还很落后的大国，那怕是推行只能提高效率百分之几或者百分之几十的简易技术和土办法，也有巨大的经济价值。况且，许多简易技术和土办法也能使生产几倍地增长。这在大炼钢铁的群众运动中，在水利建设和农业生产的工具改革的群众运动中，都已经表现得特别明显。
    在技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中，必须加强党的领导，必须注意把技术和政治结合起来。政治是统帅，是灵魂。只要政治工作稍微一放松，技术工作就一定会走到邪路上去。是敢想敢干还是前怕龙后怕虎；是积极支持先进的新生的事物，还是轻视它，阻碍它，对它泼冷水；是依靠广大群众，还是依靠少数人；是结合生产实际，还是脱离生产需要；是只抓大的、洋的技术，还是大中小并举、洋土并举；是排斥别人的先进经验，还是学习别人的先进经验；这些重大问题都是政治思想上的问题。政治不挂帅，这些思想问题不解决，技术革新和技术革命的群众运动的发展就要受到阻碍。因此，在技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中，最重要的还是实行政治挂帅，加强党的领导。
    1960年的伟大任务在召唤！让我们高举毛泽东同志的不断革命的思想红旗，沿着技术革新和技术革命的道路，争取实现1960年的继续跃进，向六十年代的伟大目标阔步前进！
