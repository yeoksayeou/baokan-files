Let Quyi Better Serve Socialism
By our commentator

The Ministry of Culture's performance of outstanding Quyi programs has concluded. Although only a small number of actors from a few regions of our country participated in this performance, and only a portion of the outstanding programs created and compiled since the Great Leap Forward were performed, it is already gratifying to see the leaping development of our country's Quyi art in the past one or two years under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction. The number of programs reflecting modern life in this performance is large, and their ideological and artistic qualities have improved compared to the 1958 National Quyi Performance. Further progress has also been made in the compilation of excellent traditional programs. Many modern programs depict and praise the new heroic figures with proletarian ideology, style, and morality that have emerged in large numbers during the Great Leap Forward, satirize and criticize various bourgeois ideas and right-leaning conservative thoughts, and attack the enemies of the people. They enthusiastically sing the praises of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. For example, the Henan Zhui Zi "Subduing the Fire Dragon Mountain" describes Zhang Guangyin, the Party Secretary of a people's commune, who has lofty communist ideals. Under the leadership of the Party, he dares to think and act, working with the masses. On the one hand, he struggles against various right-leaning conservative ideas, and on the other hand, he creates tampers and water pumps, diverting water to the mountains, and successfully completes the water conservancy project. Another example is Li Guofeng in "Tempered into Steel." In the red flag race for steelmaking, he doesn't strive for the red flag just for the sake of winning. When he discovers that the blast furnace of the opposing team has cracked and the situation is critical, he bravely risks his life to climb onto the furnace and repair it, fully demonstrating the spirit of communist cooperation. The Xihe Dagu "Night Visit to a Thousand Mu Field" criticizes the selfish ideas of an elderly farmer in the large-scale high-yield movement of the people's commune. The crosstalk "Yesterday" exposes and satirizes the old society and old ideas, and praises the new society and new ideas. "Fierce Battle in the Sky" vividly describes how Li Guanghui, a pilot of our People's Air Force, heroically and cleverly shot down Cao Shangfei, the ace pilot of the Chiang bandit army. The Jingyun Dagu "Xu Xuehui, the Party's Good Daughter" and "Xiang Xiuli, the Party's Good Daughter" praise their noble qualities of infinite loyalty to the Party and the motherland and protecting the people's property. The Sichuan Qingyin "Jiang Zhujun" and the Hubei Yugu "Lin Xiangqian" praise the revolutionary martyrs who will forever live in the hearts of the people. Many works feature vivid characters, colorful stories, and captivating narratives. The artistic performances can infect the audience, and the forms are fresh and lively, making them popular with the masses. Many traditional programs also express the patriotism, democracy, and heroism of the ancient people, such as the Pingtan "New Mulan Ci" and "Teahouse," the Jingyun Dagu "Zhao Yun Intercepts Jiang," and the Danxian "Du Shiniang," which have all been well received by the audience.

From this performance, we can also see that the achievements in the innovation of Quyi art are worthy of attention. Due to the need to express new content of struggle in life and new thoughts and feelings, as well as the continuous improvement of the new audience's appreciation requirements for Quyi art, the question of how to continuously inherit and develop excellent traditional Quyi art and create new works to enrich and improve the expressive power of Quyi art and better serve socialism has become a common direction for the exploration and practice of the vast number of Quyi actors. In this performance, the Qingyin "Jiang Zhujun," the Jingyun Dagu "Xu Xuehui, the Party's Good Daughter," and the Pingtan "New Mulan Ci," etc., based on the needs of the content they express, have reformed the old singing styles or created some new singing styles and accompaniment tunes, and some have appropriately enriched the accompaniment instruments and increased the number of singers and accompanists. The Shandong Kuaishu "Old General Giving Way to the Car" and the Hubei Pingshu "Wisely Breaking into Poyang" have not only made creations in the art of "speaking" but have also greatly enriched the art of performance. It can be seen that in the performance of Quyi programs, the elements of literature, music, and drama are often combined with each other. In addition to the characteristics of being convenient for timely reflection of reality, cooperating with central tasks, being easy to approach the masses, and being mastered and created by the masses, the combination of "speaking," "singing," and "acting" and the use of diverse artistic forms to fully express the ideological content of the literary script are among the characteristics that distinguish Quyi from other arts. If these characteristics can be fully utilized in artistic innovation, Quyi art has the potential to more powerfully and perfectly express the great era in which we live, so that it can achieve greater prosperity and development.

The expansion of professional Quyi teams and the improvement of their political, cultural, and artistic levels are rapid. In workers, peasants, troops, government offices, schools, and in the art activities of fraternal nationalities, mass amateur Quyi activities have developed unprecedentedly. Many professional Quyi workers have gloriously become Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, many are advanced workers, and some who were originally illiterate are now able to read and write. They often go to the mountains and the countryside, go deep among the masses, cooperate with central tasks, and carry out performances and propaganda and mobilization work, reflecting the Great Leap Forward, promoting the Great Leap Forward, and also improving their ideological awareness and the ideological and artistic level of their programs. The growth of young Quyi actors is also very rapid. Those who participated in this performance accounted for more than half of all the actors. They are advancing bravely along the road of being both red and expert, and the programs they performed this time are also welcomed by the audience.

Our country's socialist construction is leaping forward at a high speed. Quyi workers must better serve the general line and serve socialism. They should strive to help the audience improve their socialist and communist ideological awareness and moral qualities, and criticize and eliminate the ideological and political influence of the bourgeoisie. They should continue to work hard to create programs that reflect the reality of the struggle in life, closely cooperate with the central tasks, inspire the people's enthusiasm for production and construction and revolutionary enthusiasm, and constantly improve the ideological and artistic qualities of the programs, and gradually accumulate repertoire. For excellent traditional programs, we must carry out more planned and active compilation and performance, and harmless traditional programs should not be rejected. Quyi art forms, styles, and activity methods are diverse and varied, and must be fully utilized. If only one form is used instead of multiple forms, if only one activity method is used instead of multiple activity methods, if only long pieces are used instead of short pieces, or if only short pieces are used and not long pieces, or if there are too many rules and restrictions on the use and innovation of art forms, this will be detrimental to fully exerting the role of Quyi art.

In order to better do the above work, it is necessary to further improve the ideological and professional level of existing Quyi workers, vigorously develop new Quyi teams, and special attention should be paid to further developing amateur Quyi activities in factories, rural areas, troops, government offices, schools, shops, etc., according to needs and possibilities, actively cultivating mass Quyi backbones, and frequently compiling and performing various programs to closely cooperate with central tasks and enliven the cultural life of the masses. This team is the largest in number, and its role is also huge. Professional Quyi workers should provide help and guidance and learn from them. Professional Quyi workers must strive to become both red and expert, consolidate their proletarian worldview, and eliminate the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie. Quyi workers must express the new era of the masses and be accepted by the masses. They must go to the mountains, the countryside, factories, and companies to perform for the masses, participate in labor training, and at the same time strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Quyi workers should strive to improve their literary and artistic accomplishments and technical level, and the training of young actors must be carried out in a more planned way. In this way, the combination of professional and amateur, the combination of popularization and improvement, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and art policy, the Quyi cause will achieve greater development, better play its role as a literary and art vanguard, and Quyi art will rapidly bloom with newer and more beautiful flowers.

    让曲艺更好地为社会主义服务
    本报评论员
    文化部举办的曲艺优秀节目汇报演出已经结束了。参加这次演出的虽然只是我国少数地区的一部分演员，所演出的也只是大跃进以来创作和整理的优秀节目的一部分，但已经令人欣喜地看到我国的曲艺艺术在党的社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，近一、二年来有了飞跃的发展。这次演出的反映现代生活的节目，数量很多，思想性和艺术性较1958年全国曲艺会演时又有提高，优秀传统节目的整理也进一步取得成绩。很多现代节目描写和颂扬了大跃进中大量涌现出来的具有无产阶级思想、风格、道德品质的新英雄人物，讽刺和批判了各种资产阶级思想和右倾保守思想，抨击了人民的敌人，热情歌颂了总路线、大跃进和人民公社。比如，河南坠子“降伏火龙山”描写一个人民公社的党委书记张光印，具有崇高的共产主义理想，在党的领导下，敢想敢干，和群众在一起，一方面同各种右倾保守思想作斗争，一方面创造了打夯机、抽水机等，引水上山，胜利完成了水利工程。又如“百炼成钢”中的李国枫，在炼钢的红旗竞赛中，不是为夺红旗而夺红旗，当他发现竞赛对方的高炉裂了缝，情势危急，便英勇地冒着生命危险爬上炉去，把炉修好，充分发扬了共产主义大协作的精神。西河大鼓“夜逛千亩田”批评了人民公社大面积丰产运动中一个老年农民的自私自利的思想。相声“昨天”暴露和讽刺了旧社会和旧思想，歌颂了新社会和新思想。“长空激战”生动地描写了我人民空军飞行员李光辉英勇机智地击毁蒋匪军王牌飞行员草上飞的故事。京韵大鼓“党的好女儿徐学惠”、“党的好女儿向秀丽”等歌颂了她们对党对祖国无限忠诚、保卫人民财产的高贵品质。四川清音“江竹筠”、湖北渔鼓“林祥谦”等歌颂了永远活在人民心中的革命烈士。很多作品中的人物性格鲜明，有声有色，故事生动，引人入胜，艺术演唱能感染观众，形式新鲜活泼，为群众喜闻乐见。不少传统节目也表现了古代人民的爱国主义、民主主义思想和英雄气概，如评弹“新木兰辞”、“茶坊”，京韵大鼓“赵云截江”，单弦“杜十娘”等，都受到了观众的欢迎。
    从这次演出还可以看到曲艺艺术革新方面的成就是值得重视的。由于表现新的斗争生活内容和新的思想感情的需要，以及新的观众对曲艺艺术的欣赏要求的不断提高，因此，如何不断继承和发展优秀的传统曲艺艺术并进行新的创造，以丰富和提高曲艺艺术的表现力，更好地为社会主义服务的问题，就成为广大曲艺演员努力探索与实践的共同方向。这次演出的清音“江竹筠”、京韵大鼓“党的好女儿徐学惠”、评弹“新木兰辞”等，根据表现内容的需要，有的对旧的唱腔加以改革或创造了些新的唱腔和伴奏曲子，有的适当丰富了伴奏乐器和增加了演唱、伴唱演员。山东快书“老将军让车”、湖北评书“智闯鄱阳”等除了在“说”的艺术上有所创造外，还大大丰富了表演艺术。可以看到，在曲艺节目的表演中，文学、音乐、戏剧的因素往往是互相结合的，除了便于及时反映现实、配合中心任务，便于接近群众和为群众所掌握与创造等特点外，“说”“唱”“做”互相结合，以多种多样的艺术形式来充分表现文学脚本的思想内容，这是曲艺有别于其它艺术的特点之一。进行艺术革新时如能充分发挥这些特点的作用，曲艺艺术就有可能更有力地、更完美地表现我们所处的伟大的时代，使它得到更大的繁荣和发展。
    专业曲艺队伍的扩大和政治、文化、艺术水平的提高是快的；在工人、农民、部队、机关、学校中，在兄弟民族的艺术活动中，群众业余曲艺活动更有了空前的发展。专业曲艺工作者中有很多人已经光荣地成为共产党员和共青团员，很多人是先进工作者，有些人本来是文盲现在已能看书写字，他们经常上山下乡、深入群众，配合中心任务，进行演唱和宣传鼓动工作，反映了大跃进，促进了大跃进，也提高了自己的思想觉悟和节目的思想艺术水平；青少年曲艺演员的成长也是很快的，参加这次演出的就占全体演员的一半以上，他们在沿着又红又专的方向奋勇前进，他们这次演唱的节目也为观众所欢迎。
    我国的社会主义建设正以高速度向前大跃进，曲艺工作者必须更好地为总路线服务，为社会主义服务，应当努力帮助观众提高社会主义、共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质，批判、肃清资产阶级的思想、政治影响。应当继续努力创作反映现实斗争生活的节目，密切配合中心任务，鼓舞人民的生产建设热情和革命热情，并不断提高节目的思想性和艺术性，逐渐积累保留节目。对于优秀的传统节目，必须更有计划地积极地进行整理和上演，对无害的传统节目也不应加以排斥。曲艺艺术形式、体裁、风格和活动方式多种多样，必须充分加以运用，只要一样形式不要多样形式，只要一种活动方式不要多种活动方式，只要长篇不要短篇或只要小段而不要长篇，或对艺术形式的使用和革新的尝试有过多的清规戒律，这对于充分发挥曲艺艺术的作用都是不利的。
    为了更好地作好以上工作，必须进一步提高现有曲艺工作者的思想业务水平，大力发展新的曲艺队伍，应特别注意在工厂、农村、部队、机关、学校、商店等，根据需要和可能进一步开展业余曲艺活动，积极培养群众曲艺骨干，经常编演各种节目，密切配合中心任务，活跃群众的文化生活。这支队伍是最大量的，他们的作用也是巨大的，专业曲艺工作者要进行帮助、辅导，并向他们学习。专业曲艺工作者必须努力走向又红又专，要巩固地树立无产阶级的世界观，清除资产阶级的政治、思想影响。曲艺工作者要表现新的群众的时代，并为群众所接受，就必须上山下乡下工厂下连队到群众中去进行演出，参加劳动锻炼，同时努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想。曲艺工作者应努力提高文艺修养和技术水平，青年演员的培养工作必须更有计划地进行。这样，专业与业余结合，普及与提高结合，在毛主席文艺方针的指导下，曲艺事业将会得到更大的发展，更能发挥它的文艺尖兵作用，曲艺艺术将会迅速开放出更新更美的花朵。
