Leaping Towards Mechanization in the Yangtze River Region
Zhou Youhe, First Secretary of the Yangtze River People's Commune, Jiangning County

In 1960, our Yangtze River People's Commune will fully realize agricultural mechanization, using electricity and machines for all major agricultural production processes!

In this year, we will make 83,000 mu of land produce a total grain output equivalent to the sum of the yields from the four years between 1949 and 1952—one hundred million jin!

1959 was an extraordinary year, a year of continued Great Leap Forward and great victory. The Yangtze River Commune achieved great success in simultaneous leaps forward in all five sectors and a comprehensive bumper harvest. In terms of grain production alone, the total annual output reached more than 62 million jin, with a yield of 822 jin per mu, an increase of more than 52% compared to 1958. The amount of grain sold to the state throughout the year was equivalent to the total amount sold in the six years from 1949 to 1954. Coupled with the multiple-fold development of sideline occupations and industry, the total annual income increased by 51.8% compared to 1958. On this basis, agricultural mechanization became as if a tiger had grown wings or a roc soared into the sky. In one year, we purchased eleven tractors, six water pumps, two seeders, and a total of twelve various machine plows and harrows, enabling more than 47% of the dry land to achieve mechanized cultivation and more than 58% of the farmland to achieve machine irrigation. The commune members personally experienced the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune and the tremendous power of agricultural mechanization, and they were filled with hope and confidence in fully realizing agricultural mechanization. They said, "1959 was a year of great achievements, with a large increase in iron oxen and iron dragons. Let's muster our heroic strength to fully realize mechanization!" When will it be realized? At first, some said three years, some said five years. Of course, some also said that such a major undertaking could not be accomplished in ten or eight years, and that it would be impossible without the state taking care of it. However, after socialist education, after recalculating the accounts and tapping the potential again, many different views converged into one: It's not far away, it's right in front of us, not too long, not too short, it's in 1960! And by 1962, we will completely and thoroughly achieve mechanized cultivation, water conservancy of farmland, electrification of drainage and irrigation, and motorization of transportation.

With the support of the Party at higher levels and the help of relevant units, we have formulated a three-year production and construction plan. According to this plan, in 1960, all more than 83,000 mu of land in the entire commune will be cultivated by machines and electricity; 70% of the three wheat crops will be harvested and threshed by machines, and 50% of the sowing will be done by machines. In this way, in addition to the existing seventeen tractors and some mechanical farm tools, we will also need to purchase various tractors and mechanical farm tools.

The realization of this plan requires a large amount of funds, manpower, and materials. According to calculations, the total mechanical construction requires 1.64 million yuan; more than 490 various drivers, combine operators, electric plow operators, and other machine operators; 153 rooms for building machine depots, workshops, etc.; and the construction of 54 roads totaling 132 kilometers in length and 17 bridges.

Can this plan be realized? Our answer is a very definite yes. The resounding slogan put forward by all our commune members is, "Great ambition and heroic spirit are as firm as steel. Work hard in 1960, fully realize mechanization, break through the one hundred million jin mark for grain, achieve high yields in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and increase the total annual output value threefold!" As for the technical personnel issue, in addition to the six technical personnel and welders, etc., that need to be supported and allocated by higher levels, the remaining personnel are prepared to train themselves on the basis of the existing technical force, using methods such as running training classes and apprenticeships.

We have the leadership of the correct and great Party and Chairman Mao, we have the General Line, we have the incomparably superior People's Commune, and we have the strong support of our worker brothers. We have full confidence in fully realizing mechanization. In the formulation of the three-year production and construction plan, relevant industrial, electrical, and other departments have enthusiastically provided great help, which has doubled our determination and confidence in fully realizing agricultural mechanization. The commune members have a ballad: "The worker-peasant alliance is more powerful than heaven. The production front gives great support. Sending iron dragons to overcome drought, sending iron oxen to plow the land. Thank you, worker brothers. We are determined to fight hard in 1960, fully realize mechanization, and break through the one hundred million jin mark for grain!"

    向机械化飞奔江
    江宁县长江公社第一书记  周友和
    1960年，我们长江人民公社要全面地实现农业机械化，使主要农业生产工序都用上电力和机械操作！
    在这一年中，我们要使八万三千亩土地，长出相当于从1949年到1952年四个年头产量总和的粮食——一亿斤！
    1959年是不平凡的一年，是继续大跃进、大胜利的一年。长江公社取得了五业齐跃进、全面大丰收的巨大成绩。单就粮食生产来说，全年总产量达到了六千二百多万斤，单产八百二十二斤，比1958年增长了52％以上。全年卖给国家的粮食相当于从1949年到1954年六个年度卖粮的总数。加上副业、工业的成倍发展，全年总收入比1958年增长51．8％。在这个基础上，农业机械化也便如猛虎添翅，巨鹏凌霄，一年中添购了拖拉机十一台，抽水机六台，播种机二台，以及各种机犁、机耙共有十二部，使47％以上的旱地实现了机械耕作，58％以上的农田实现了机器灌溉。社员们亲身体验到人民公社的无比优越和农业机械化的巨大威力，对全面实现农业机械化充满了希望和信心。他们说：“1959年，成绩大，铁牛、铁龙大增加，再鼓一把英雄劲，全面实现机械化！”什么时候实现呢？开头，有的说三年，有的说要五年，当然，也有人说这种大事非十年八年办不成，甚至国家不来办根本就没办法。可是，经过社会主义教育，经过再次地算细账，挖潜力，多少主张变为一个主张了：远在天边，近在眼前，不长不短，就在1960年！而到1962年，则将全部彻底地达到耕作机械化、农田水利化、排灌机电化，运输车船化了。
    在上级党的支持和有关单位的帮助下，我们制订了一个三年生产建设的规划。按照这个规划，在1960年中，全公社八万三千多亩土地都将全部使用机、电耕作；70％的三麦使用机械收割和脱粒，50％的播种要由机械操作。这样，除了现有的十七台拖拉机和一部分机械农具，还要添购各种拖拉机和机械农具。
    实现这个规划，需要大量的资金、人力和物力。据核算，全部机械建设共需一百六十四万元；各种驾驶员、康拜因手、电犁手等机务人员四百九十多名；建筑机库、车间等房屋一百五十三间，修筑五十四条、长达一百三十二公里的公路和十七座桥梁。
    这个规划能不能实现呢？我们的回答是十分肯定的，能够。我们全体社员提出的响亮口号是“大志雄心似钢坚，大干1960年，全面实现机械化，粮食闯过亿斤关，林牧副渔齐高产，全年产值增三倍！”至于技术人员问题，除了六名技术人员及电焊工等需上级支持调配外，其余人员都准备在现有技术力量的基础上，用开办训练班、师傅带徒弟的办法自己培训。
    我们有正确、伟大的党和毛主席的领导，有总路线，有无比优越的人民公社，有工人老大哥对我们的有力支持，我们是有充分信心全面实现机械化的。在制订三年生产建设规划中，有关工业、电业等部门，都热情地给予了很大的帮助，这使我们加倍地增强了全面实现农业机械化的决心和信心。社员们有一首快板诗：“工农联盟力胜天，生产战线大支援，送来铁龙胜干旱，送来铁牛把地翻，感谢工人老大哥，决心大战1960年，全面实现机械化，粮食闯过亿斤关！”
