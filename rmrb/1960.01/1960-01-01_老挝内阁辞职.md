　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 31st -- Vientiane Radio broadcast tonight that the Lao cabinet of Phoui Sananikone submitted its resignation to King Savang Vatthana on the 30th. According to the radio broadcast, the King of Laos has agreed to the resignation of the Sananikone cabinet.

　　Sananikone had reorganized his cabinet on the 19th, and the new cabinet did not include members of the so-called "Committee for the Defence of National Interests." After reorganizing the cabinet, Sananikone declared that there was no change in the political line of the new cabinet.

　　After Sananikone reorganized the cabinet, the ultra-pro-American so-called "Committee for the Defence of National Interests" announced its opposition to the cabinet reshuffle and demanded the government's resignation and the dissolution of the National Assembly. In the past few days, the "Committee for the Defence of National Interests" also mobilized troops, tanks, and armored vehicles to stage demonstrations in Vientiane.

    老挝内阁辞职
    新华社河内31日电　据万象电台今晚广播，老挝培·萨纳尼空内阁在30日向国王萨旺·瓦达纳提出辞职。据这家电台广播，老挝国王已经同意萨纳尼空内阁辞职。
    萨纳尼空曾经在19日改组了他的内阁，这个新内阁没有包括所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的成员。萨纳尼空在改组内阁后曾经宣称，新内阁的政治路线没有任何改变。
    在萨纳尼空改组内阁以后，极端亲美的所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”曾经宣布反对内阁改组，并且要求政府辞职和解散国民议会。在过去几天中，“保卫国家利益委员会”还出动军队、坦克和装甲车，在万象举行了示威。
