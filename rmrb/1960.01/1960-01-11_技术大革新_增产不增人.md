    Technical Revolution: Increased Production Without Increasing Manpower

    This year's requirement that existing enterprises generally expand reproduction without increasing personnel is determined by the leaping development of the entire national economy. The industrial production labor force mainly comes from the countryside. However, since the communization of the people, with the expansion of the scale of production and the development of various economic undertakings, the countryside needs even more labor. Under today's circumstances, it is not only impossible to transfer a large amount of labor to existing factories and mines, but industry is required to help the countryside improve agricultural labor productivity in all aspects. The purpose of industry's vigorous support for agriculture in achieving modernization is precisely to greatly increase agricultural labor productivity. Therefore, the continued leap forward in industrial production this year can only rely on tapping the potential of the existing labor force, and cannot significantly increase personnel; this requires us to do everything possible to improve labor productivity, save and use labor rationally, and free up more labor to support the production needs of new and expanded units.

    The demands of the situation are such. However, some people hold a "rising tide lifts all boats" mentality, saying that increased production requires increased manpower.

    Some people also believe that after the increased production and economy movement, the potential of the labor force has been almost exhausted, and the improvement of labor productivity has reached its peak. This view does not conform to the actual situation. We say that the continuous growth of labor productivity is originally one of the laws of socialist economics. With the continuous improvement of the class consciousness and technical proficiency of the workers, and the continuous improvement of social material and technical production conditions, labor productivity will only become higher and higher, and it will never reach its peak. As far as the labor productivity of factories and enterprises in this province is concerned, the difference between general units and advanced units is still very large. The potential of the labor force is not already exhausted, but there is much to be tapped. At present, a large part of the medium-sized and small enterprises in this province are basically based on manual operation. As long as some equipment is slightly added and the technology is carefully improved, labor productivity can be multiplied. After eighteen factories in Jinchang District of Suzhou City changed manual operations to semi-mechanized and mechanized operations, the labor productivity of fifteen of them increased by more than two times compared with last year. Small factories are like this, and modern enterprises are also like this. According to the statistics of thirty-six factories in Nanjing with a high degree of mechanization, about one-third or even half of the workers still rely on manual operation. If we change this part of manual operation to semi-mechanized operation or mechanized operation, labor productivity can be greatly improved.

### 技术大革新　增产不增人

    技术大革新　增产不增人
    今年要求各原有企业一般在不增加人员的前提下扩大再生产，这是整个国民经济跃进的形势所决定的。工业生产的劳动力主要来自农村。但是，自从人民公社化以来，随着生产规模的扩大和各种经济事业的发展，农村需要的劳动力更多了，在今天的情况下，不仅是再调很多劳动力给原有厂矿是不可能的，而且要求工业从各方面帮助农村提高农业劳动生产率。工业大力支援农业实现现代化的目的，也正是为了大大提高农业的劳动生产率。所以，今年工业生产的继续跃进，只能依靠挖掘现有劳动力的潜力，而不能大量增加人员；这就要求我们千方百计提高劳动生产率，尽量节约和合理使用劳动力，并且要腾出更多的劳力支援新建和扩建单位的生产需要。
    形势的要求就是这样。但是有人抱着一种“水涨船高”的思想，说什么要增产必须增人。
    还有些人认为经过增产节约运动，劳动力的潜力已经快要挖光，劳动生产率的提高已经到顶。这种看法是不符合实际情况的。我们说劳动生产率的不断增长，本来就是社会主义经济规律之一，随着职工群众阶级觉悟和技术熟练程度的不断提高，社会物质技术生产条件的不断完善，劳动生产率只会越来越高，它是永远不会到顶的。就本省工厂企业的劳动生产率来讲，一般单位同先进单位比较，相差还是很远的，劳动力的潜力不是已经挖光，而是大有可挖。目前本省很大一部分中、小型企业基本上还是以手工操作为主的，只要稍微增添一些设备，认真改进一下技术，就可以成倍的提高劳动生产率。苏州市金阊区有十八家工厂把手工作业改为半机械化和机械化操作后，其中就有十五家工厂的劳动生产率比去年提高了两倍以上。小型工厂是如此，现代化企业也是如此。据南京市三十六个机械化程度较高的工厂的统计，目前也还有三分之一甚至一半左右的工人仍然靠手工操作。如果我们把这部分手工操作改为半机械化操作或机械化操作，劳动生产率就可以大大提高一步。
