    Re-reading "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire"

    "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" is a letter written by Comrade Mao Zedong on January 5, 1930.
    Thirty years ago, the Chinese revolution was indeed in a situation where the enemy was strong and we were weak. However, Comrade Mao Zedong, with a high degree of Marxist-Leninist scientific analysis and revolutionary optimism, saw that "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" and told us: "When looking at things, it is necessary to look at their essence, and only regard their phenomena as guides to enter the door. Once inside the door, grasp its essence. This is a reliable scientific method of analysis." Today, thirty years later, in terms of the situation of class struggle, it is no longer a case of the enemy being strong and us being weak, but rather of us being strong and the enemy being weak. We are now in a new era of "the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind" internationally, and in a new era of the Chinese people building socialism with a leaping posture. Whether in terms of the international situation or the domestic situation, there have been fundamental changes compared to those years. However, at any time and in any work, we need to accurately estimate the situation in order to carry out the struggle correctly. If we cannot grasp the essence of things through the phenomena, we may be dazzled when the situation develops to a turning point, or we may generate blind action or pessimism.
    The facts are exactly like this. Today, we are already in a victorious situation. Whenever we want to leap forward further, there are often some comrades who cannot grasp the essence of things through the phenomena, cannot see the situation clearly, and are frightened by some temporary difficulties in the course of advancement. They cannot consistently and vigorously go all out, and advance courageously, but instead hesitate and shrink back, showing a right-leaning mood. Therefore, frequently reading this letter written by Comrade Mao Zedong thirty years ago, and comprehending its spiritual essence, is of great benefit to arming our minds, guiding us to see the situation clearly, strengthening our confidence, and encouraging us to overcome difficulties.
    The so-called grasping the essence of things is to grasp the fundamental trend of development of things. "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," this is the fundamental trend of development of things. This contains two layers of meaning: one layer is that new things, even if they are only "a single spark," their fundamental trend of development is that they will definitely become a "prairie fire," they will definitely defeat the decadent forces, defeat all the thousands of difficulties that hinder their development, and thus achieve victory; the other layer is that the decadent forces facing the new things, and the various difficulties that hinder the development of new things, although they may seem to have great power, their fundamental trend of development is that they will be "burned" by the "single spark," and will be defeated and overcome by the new things.
    In this letter, Comrade Mao Zedong tells us that comrades suffering from revolutionary impetuosity are "inappropriately overestimating the subjective forces of the revolution and underestimating the counter-revolutionary forces;" people with pessimistic thoughts, on the other hand, inappropriately "underestimate the subjective forces of the revolution and overestimate the counter-revolutionary forces." From this, the direct education we receive is that accurately estimating the strength of both sides in the domestic and international class struggle is a basic requirement for us to correctly estimate the situation. However, the education we receive from this should not be limited to this point alone. We should extend from this to understand that accurately estimating difficult conditions and favorable conditions in various construction works, and accurately estimating objective conditions and the subjective dynamic role of the revolutionary people, should also be a basic requirement for us to correctly estimate the construction situation. "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," this truth is not subjectively conceived by anyone, but is a scientific conclusion derived from accurately estimating the subjective and objective forces. Because, although objective phenomena are ever-changing and intricate, there are always some factors that are constantly playing a role, while some factors are not constantly playing a role. The factors that are constantly playing a role determine the fundamental trend of development of things; those factors that are not constantly playing a role can only cause temporary twists and turns in the development of things, but can never determine the fundamental trend of development of things. New things are constantly struggling, constantly growing, and decadent forces are constantly festering, constantly declining. These are the factors that are constantly playing a role in the development of things, and thus, this also determines the fundamentally different trends of development between new forces and decadent forces. By the same token, although any difficulty is hindering people's progress, there are two kinds of difficulties: one is the difficulty in decline, and the other is the difficulty in progress. For the decadent forces, their difficulties are the difficulties in decline. Since they have been determined to be headed towards death, these difficulties in decline are insurmountable for them. For the new forces, all difficulties are only difficulties in progress. Since the new forces are full of vigorous revolutionary fighting spirit, they can overcome any difficulties through struggle. Difficulties can be overcome by people's struggles, but difficulties can also conquer those who have stopped struggling and lost their fighting spirit. This is also a factor that is constantly playing a role in the development of things. Difficulties, for the revolutionary new forces, inherently contain the possibility of being overcome. This is the basic basis that determines that we, the proletarian fighters who are always full of revolutionary vigor, and the Chinese people, can continuously leap forward.
    For us communists, the factors that are constantly playing a role in the development of the revolutionary situation are that our socialist-communist cause is just, conforms to the objective laws of social development, conforms to the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people, and is enthusiastically supported by the broad masses of people; that the Communist Party leading the Chinese revolution is a great, glorious, and correct party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought; that there are hundreds of millions of working people's revolutionary enthusiasm and endless wisdom and strength; that our Party always stays with the broad masses of people to carry out revolution and construction with a continuous revolutionary communist spirit; and that there is support from socialist brother countries and the people of the world. Therefore, no matter at any time, the development of the situation, although there may be twists and turns, the general trend is getting better and better for us day by day. Thirty years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong accurately analyzed the development of various contradictions that triggered the revolutionary high tide, grasped the various factors that constantly played a role, so he was able to see through the phenomenon that "after the failure of the 1927 revolution, the subjective forces of the revolution were indeed greatly weakened," and made the conclusion that "a single spark can start a prairie fire," correctly pointing out: "Although there is only a small force now, its development will be very fast. In the environment of China, it not only has the possibility of development, but also the inevitability of development." For the enemies of the revolution, the factors that are constantly playing a role in the development of the situation are that they are decadent and declining forces, that they stand on the opposite side of the historical trend of progress; that their own contradictions, the contradictions between their various groups, and the contradictions between them and the broad masses of working people, are expanding day by day and cannot be overcome; that their reactionary nature determines that they cannot deceive the broad masses of people for a long time, and the more vicious and ruthless they are, the more quickly they dig their own graves. Therefore, the development of the situation, although the sky may be temporarily covered with dark clouds, the general trend for all enemies of the revolution is getting worse and worse day by day. It is precisely because of this that Comrade Mao Zedong was able to point out thirty years ago, when the domestic and international counter-revolutionary forces were still quite strong, that: "In essence, it is when the counter-revolutionary tide begins to ebb and the revolutionary tide begins to revive."
    Comrade Mao Zedong not only saw that "a single spark can start a prairie fire" from the factors that constantly played a role in the development of the revolutionary situation, but he also consistently used this point of view to look at our country's economic construction and all new things. In March 1949, the Third Domestic Revolutionary War had not yet ended, and the People's Republic of China had not yet been established. In the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, made under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, on the one hand, it was acknowledged that "China's economic heritage is backward," but it was immediately pointed out that: "The Chinese people are brave and hardworking, the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic, the leadership of the Communist Party of China, plus the assistance of the proletariat of all countries in the world, mainly the assistance of the Soviet Union," as well as "we have the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. We can get rid of bad styles and maintain good styles. We can learn things that we did not originally understand," these constantly playing factors, thereby concluding that: "The speed of China's economic construction will not be very slow but may be quite fast, and China's prosperity can be expected in the near future." In the first half of 1955, in the cooperative movement, there was a cold wind that wanted the movement to quickly "dismount," but Comrade Mao Zedong saw the direction of the 500 million peasants of the whole country from the three poor peasant households in a very small cooperative in Hebei Province who insisted on taking the road of cooperativization, and concluded that: "All individual operating peasants will eventually take the road firmly chosen by these three poor peasant households."
    Of course, what is said above does not mean that we should not pay attention to difficulties, even temporary and extremely small difficulties, when analyzing the situation and handling specific problems. Comrade Mao Zedong has always taught us to despise difficulties strategically, but to pay attention to difficulties tactically. Only by paying attention to difficulties, and by taking various practical and effective measures to fight against difficulties, can we finally overcome difficulties. However, the fact that any difficulty becomes an obstacle is not constantly playing a role for us revolutionaries; while the fact that difficulties can be overcome by our struggle is constantly playing a role. Our revolutionary cause, in the final analysis, is the cause of fighting against all decaying old things, and the old things will not be willing to die easily, but will struggle for their own survival, which will inevitably cause us some difficulties, large and small. If we want to eliminate classes, we will encounter resistance from the bourgeoisie and the spontaneous forces of rural capitalism; if we want to defeat the earth and conquer nature, we will encounter resistance from nature. This is the source of our difficulties. Since we will inevitably encounter various difficulties on our road forward, of course, we cannot ignore this objective existence, and we cannot fail to pay attention to it. However, we should look at difficulties from three aspects: first, difficulties are always temporary and local for us revolutionaries; second, difficulties can only be overcome after a period of struggle; third, difficulties, after a period or several periods of struggle by the revolutionary people, will eventually not be able to resist the fundamental trend of development of things, and will have to be overcome in the end. Therefore, we always pay attention to tactical difficulties under the strategic premise of despising difficulties. The reason why we are confident that we will be able to overcome difficulties is because we are revolutionaries, we represent the new forces that are constantly rising and developing, we are not a lonely force detached from the masses, but are closely linked with the broad masses of working people; the fundamental trend of social development is that "the socialist system will eventually replace the capitalist system," and the fundamental trend of the struggle between man and nature is that man is constantly conquering nature. These are objective laws that are independent of people's will; all development of human society has always been the result of the fighting working people overcoming difficulties, and only lazy people who have stopped fighting will be conquered by difficulties. "A single spark can start a prairie fire" is not only the heroic spirit of the revolution, but also the most correct scientific analysis that conforms to objective laws.
    Have we encountered difficulties in carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction? We can say with certainty that we have encountered not small difficulties. These difficulties come from two aspects: one is from domestic and foreign enemies and various anti-socialist forces within the people, including the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois worldviews and their habits in people's ideology; and the other is from the objective situation of our country being "poor and blank." However, how did things develop? The essence is that we have realized the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. After the anti-Rightist struggle and the all-people rectification movement, we have achieved a decisive victory on the political and ideological fronts, following the decisive victory on the economic front. The enthusiasm of 650 million people to build socialism-communism has been fully mobilized; the wise leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and the brilliant light of the General Line, have propelled our country into a new stage of the Great Leap Forward, where "one day equals twenty years"; our people have promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and have fully exerted their subjective dynamic role; the Party's General Line and a whole set of "walking on two legs" policies have emitted infinite power; by launching mass movements and technical innovations on a large scale, our people have broken through various difficulties on all fronts, and tens of millions of innovations and inventions have emerged, overcoming difficulties one by one, increasing knowledge, gaining rich experience, and overcoming and are overcoming shortcomings in the course of advancement; we have crushed the attacks of right-leaning opportunists, and overcome and continue to overcome the right-leaning thoughts of some comrades, so we are continuing to leap forward continuously. The People's Communes in the countryside are not only more sound and consolidated, but also more developed. We will not only continue to leap forward in the great 1960, but will also continuously leap forward throughout the entire 1960s.
    Thirty years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong criticized some people who worked in the Red Army at that time for "often unconsciously generalizing and expanding such a temporary and special small environment when they encountered defeats, or were surrounded on all sides, or were closely pursued by strong enemies, as if the situation in the whole country and the whole world was generally not optimistic, and the prospect of revolutionary victory was very bleak." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The reason for this kind of observation that grasps the surface and abandons the essence is because they have not scientifically analyzed the essence of the general situation." Similarly, some of our comrades, although they also acknowledge in words that the current overall situation is very good, often forget this overall situation when carrying out a specific task, when they encounter some temporary and local difficulties, and think that the possibility of overcoming difficulties is simply "very bleak." Because they have adopted "this kind of observation that grasps the surface and abandons the essence," they are also unable to make good use of the current good situation to fully mobilize the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses, and cannot fully exert the subjective dynamic role of a revolutionary, but only know how to sigh in the face of difficulties. Our cause is advancing victoriously, and the broad masses of people are advancing victoriously, but they are carrying the burden of pessimism and lagging behind in a faltering manner. If these comrades do not wake up and use the viewpoints elucidated by Comrade Mao Zedong in this letter "A single spark can start a prairie fire" and in other works to correct their minds, who can they blame?
    In this letter, "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," Comrade Mao Zedong gave the most vivid demonstration of how to grasp the essence through the phenomena. The most important point is that he analyzed the contradictions on all sides of the enemy and ourselves at that time from the perspective of the whole, and linked these contradictions together. This contradiction leads to another contradiction, and each pair of contradictions has its leading aspect, and these contradictions are transformed into each other in the struggle. From this, on the basis of scientific analysis, he put forward a whole set of fighting strategies suitable for the specific situation at that time, fully mobilized the subjective dynamic role of the revolutionary masses, and promoted the rapid transformation of contradictions in a direction favorable to us. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong came to the conclusion that the "single spark" at that time would soon "start a prairie fire," and came to the conclusion that the revolutionary high tide was about to come. Because this is a scientific analysis, this "soon" is by no means "an empty thing that is hoped for but cannot be reached," but "a sailing ship standing on the shore and looking at the sea, already seeing the tip of the mast," is "a round of morning sun standing on the top of a high mountain and looking far to the east, already seeing the light shining in all directions and about to burst forth," is "a baby about to mature in the mother's womb." Today, we are victoriously carrying out socialist revolution and construction. We should learn from Comrade Mao Zedong to analyze the situation in this way, specifically analyze the various contradictions in our class struggle and production struggle, analyze the mutual influence between various contradictions, grasp the mainstream of the development of things, grasp the essence through the phenomena, attach a thousand times more importance to giving full play to the revolutionary subjective dynamic role of the broad masses of people, and promote the more rapid transformation of contradictions in a direction favorable to us. Thus, we can continuously oppose rightism, continuously encourage effort, and crush all the conspiracies and slanders of domestic and foreign enemies, and fight on all fronts for the high-speed, high-quality, and economical construction of socialism! As 1960 joyfully arrives, we should greet it with the spirit of revolutionary optimism taught to us by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    Let us hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and bravely advance, and let the flames of revolution burn even more vigorously!

### 再读“星星之火，可以燎原”

    再读“星星之火，可以燎原”
    周原冰
    “星星之火，可以燎原”，是毛泽东同志在1930年1月5日写的一篇通信。
    三十年前，中国革命确实还处于敌强我弱的局面下，可是，毛泽东同志就以高度的马克思列宁主义的科学分析和革命乐观主义精神，看出“星星之火，可以燎原”，并告诉我们：“看事情必须要看它的实质，而把它的现象只看作入门的向导，一进了门就要抓住它的实质，这才是可靠的科学的分析方法。”在三十年后的今天，就阶级斗争的形势来说，现在已不是敌强我弱，而是我强敌弱了。现在我们已处于国际上“东风压倒西风”的新时代，处于中国人民以跃进的雄姿建设着社会主义的新时代，无论国际形势或者国内形势，都同当年有了根本的变化。可是，我们在任何时候和任何工作中，都需要切当地估计形势，才能正确地进行战斗，如果不能透过现象把握事情的实质，就可能当形势发展到一个转折点时，被弄得眼花缭乱，或者产生盲动或者引起悲观。
    事实也正是如此。今天，我们已经处于胜利的形势下面，每当我们要进一步向前跃进的时候，往往还会有一些同志不能透过现象把握事情的实质，看不清形势，被一些前进途程中的暂时困难吓唬住了，不能始终一贯地鼓足干劲、勇往直前，而是犹豫畏缩，表现一种右倾情绪。因此，经常地一次再一次地读一读毛泽东同志在三十年前所写的这篇通信，领会它的精神实质，对于武装我们的头脑，指导我们去看清形势，增强信心，鼓励我们去战胜困难，是大有好处的。
    所谓把握事情的实质，就是把握事情的根本发展趋势。“星星之火，可以燎原”，这就是事情的根本发展趋势。这里面，包涵两层意思：一层，是说新生的事物，那怕只是“星星之火”，但它的根本发展趋势，是一定可以成为“燎原”的烈火，一定可以战胜腐朽的力量，战胜一切阻碍它发展的千万种困难，从而取得胜利；一层，是说处于新生事物对面的腐朽力量以及阻碍新生事物发展的种种困难，尽管看起来力量很大，但它的根本发展趋势是要被“星星之火”所“燎”掉的，要被新生事物所击溃和克服的。
    毛泽东同志在这篇通信中告诉我们：犯着革命急性病的同志们，是“不切当地看大了革命的主观力量，而看小了反革命力量；”有悲观思想的人们，则是不切当地“把革命的主观力量看小了，把反革命力量看大了。”从这里，我们直接得到的教育是：在分析国内外阶级斗争形势时，切当地估计敌我双方的力量，是我们正确估计形势的基本要求。但是，我们从这里所得到的教育还不应该仅仅限于这一点，应该由此引伸下去，懂得在各项建设工作中，切当地估计困难条件和有利条件，切当地估计客观条件和革命人民的主观能动作用，也应该是我们正确地估计建设形势的基本要求。“星星之火，可以燎原”，这个真理，不是谁主观臆造出来的，而是切当地估计主客观力量所得出来的科学结论。因为，尽管客观的现象是千变万化、错综复杂的，但总有些因素是经常起作用的，而有些因素则不是经常起作用的。经常起作用的因素，决定事物发展的根本趋势；那些不是经常起作用的因素，则只能引起事物发展的暂时曲折，却决不能决定事物发展的根本趋势。新生的事物在不断地斗争、不断地成长，腐朽的力量在不断地溃烂、不断地衰败，这就是在事物发展中经常起作用的因素，因而，这也就决定了新生力量与腐朽力量根本不同的发展趋势。同样的道理，任何困难虽然在阻碍人们的前进，但是，困难有两种，一种是衰落中的困难，一种是前进中的困难。对于腐朽的力量来说，他们的困难是衰落中的困难，他们既然已经被决定要趋向死亡，因而，这些衰落中的困难，对于他们就是不可克服的。对于新生的力量来说，所有的困难，都只是前进中的困难，新生的力量既然富有旺盛的革命斗志，它就可以通过斗争来战胜任何困难。困难可以通过人们的斗争而被人们所克服，困难却又可以征服那些停止了斗争、丧失了斗志的人们。这也是在事物发展中经常起作用的因素。困难，对于革命的新生力量来说，本身就包含着被克服的可能性，这就是决定我们始终富有革命朝气的无产阶级战士和中国人民能够不断跃进的基本根据。
    对于我们共产主义者来说，在革命形势的发展中经常起作用的因素，是我们的社会主义—共产主义事业是正义的，符合社会发展的客观规律，符合广大人民的根本利益，为广大人民所热烈拥护的；是领导中国革命的共产党，是以马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想所武装起来的伟大的、光荣的、正确的党；是亿万劳动人民的革命积极性和无尽的智慧与力量；是我们的党始终和广大人民在一起以不断革命的共产主义精神来进行革命和建设；是社会主义兄弟国家和全世界人民的支援。因此，不管在任何时候，形势的发展，尽管也会出现这样或那样的曲折，但总的趋势对于我们是一天天好起来和更好起来的。三十年前毛泽东同志准确地分析了引起革命高潮的各种矛盾的发展情况，掌握了其中经常起作用的种种因素，因此他能透过“一九二七年革命失败以后，革命的主观力量确实大为削弱了”的现象，作出了“星星之火，可以燎原”的结论，正确地指出：“现在虽只有一点小小的力量，但是它的发展会是很快的。它在中国的环境里不仅是具备了发展的可能性，简直是具备了发展的必然性。”对于革命的敌人来说，在形势发展中经常起作用的因素，是他们是腐朽的衰退着的力量，是他们站在历史前进方向的对立面；是他们本身的矛盾，他们各个集团之间的矛盾，他们与广大劳动人民之间的矛盾，一天天地扩大而无法克服；是他们的反动本质决定了他们不可能长期地对广大的人民发生欺骗作用，他们愈是穷凶极恶就愈是迅速地为自己挖掘着坟墓。所以，形势的发展，尽管天空中也会暂时布满乌云，但总的趋势对于一切革命的敌人，都是一天天地坏起来和更坏起来的。正因为这样，所以毛泽东同志在三十年前国内外反革命的力量还相当强大的时候，就能够指出：“实质上是反革命潮流开始下落，革命潮流开始复兴的时候。”
    毛泽东同志不仅从在革命形势发展中经常起作用的因素，看出“星星之火，可以燎原”，而且，他也一贯地用这种观点去看待我国的经济建设，看待一切新生的事物。1949年3月，第三次国内革命战争还没有结束，中华人民共和国还没有建立，在毛泽东同志主持下所作出的党的七届二中全会决议中，一方面承认“中国的经济遗产是落后的”，但是，立即指出：“中国人民是勇敢而勤劳的，中国人民革命的胜利和人民共和国的建立，中国共产党的领导权，加上世界各国无产阶级的援助，其中主要地是苏联的援助，”以及“我们有批评和自我批评这个马克思列宁主义的武器。我们能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风。我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西”这些经常起作用的因素，从而得出：“中国经济建设的速度将不是很慢而可能是相当地快的，中国的兴盛是可以计日程功的”的结论。1955年上半年，在合作化运动中曾经遇到过一股要运动赶快“下马”的冷风，但是，毛泽东同志却从河北省一个很小的合作社里的三户贫农坚持要走合作化道路，看出了全国五亿农民的方向，得出结论说：“一切个体经营的农民，终归是要走这三户贫农所坚决地选择了的道路的。”
    当然，上面所说的这些，决不是要我们在分析形势和具体处理问题的时候，不要去重视困难，那怕是暂时的极小的困难。毛泽东同志历来教导我们在战略上藐视困难，在战术上则要重视困难。只有重视困难，而又千方百计地采取种种切实有效的措施去与困难作斗争，才能最后战胜困难。但是，任何困难之成为阻碍，对我们革命者来说，不是经常起作用的；而困难之能够被我们的斗争所克服，却是经常起作用的。我们的革命事业，归根到底是同一切衰亡着的旧事物作斗争的事业，而旧事物是不会愿意轻易地死亡，要为它自己的生存而挣扎，这就不可避免地会造成我们某些大大小小的困难。我们要消灭阶级，就要遇到资产阶级和农村资本主义自发势力的反抗；我们要战胜地球、征服自然，就要遇到自然界的反抗。这就是我们困难的来源。在我们前进的道路上，既然不可避免地会遇到种种困难，当然，就不能无视这个客观的存在，就不能不去重视它。但是，我们应该从三个方面去看待困难：第一，困难，对于我们革命者来说，总是暂时性和局部性的；第二，困难，是要经过一番斗争才能够被克服的；第三，困难，经过了革命人民的一番或者几番的斗争，它就终于不能抗拒事物发展的根本趋势，而不得不终于被克服。因此，我们总是在藐视困难的战略前提下面来重视战术上的困难的。我们所以确信一定能够战胜困难，是因为，我们是革命者，我们代表的是新生的不断上升、不断发展着的力量，我们不是脱离群众的孤独的力量，而是同广大的劳动群众紧密地联在一起的；社会发展的根本趋势，是“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度”，人同自然斗争的根本趋势，是人在不断地征服自然，这都是不以人们意旨为转移的客观规律；人类社会的一切发展，从来都是战斗着的劳动人民战胜困难的结果，只有停止了战斗的懒虫，才会被困难所征服。“星星之火，可以燎原”，这不只是革命的英雄气魄，而且是最最正确的符合客观规律的科学分析。
    我们在进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设中遇到过困难没有呢？可以肯定地说，我们遇到过不小的困难。这困难，来自两方面：一是来自国内外敌人和人民内部的各种反社会主义的力量，包括人们思想意识中的资产阶级和小资产阶级的世界观及其习惯势力；二是来自我们国家“一穷二白”的客观状况。可是，事情的发展是怎样的呢？实质是，我们实现了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，经过反右派斗争和全民整风运动，我们继在经济战线上取得决定性的胜利以后，又在政治战线上和思想战线上取得了一次决定性的胜利，六亿五千万人民建设社会主义—共产主义的积极性充分被调动起来了；党和毛泽东同志的英明领导，总路线的灿烂光辉，把我国推进到“一天等于二十年”的大跃进的新阶段；我国人民发扬了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，充分发挥了主观能动作用；党的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针发出了无穷的威力；大搞群众运动、大闹技术革新，我国人民在各条战线上，突破了种种困难涌现了数以千万计的革新和发明，战胜了一个一个的困难，长了知识，取得了丰富的经验，克服了和正在克服着前进途程中的缺点；我们粉碎了右倾机会主义分子的进攻，克服了和继续克服着某些同志的右倾思想，因而，我们是在继续不断的跃进，农村中的人民公社不但更加健全、更加巩固，而且更加发展了。我们不仅在伟大的1960年还将继续跃进，而且将在整个的六十年代里连续不断地跃进。
    三十年前，毛泽东同志批判当时在红军中工作的有些人“一遇到败仗，或四面被围，或强敌跟追的时候，往往不自觉地把这种一时的特殊的小的环境，一般化扩大化起来，仿佛全国全世界的形势概属未可乐观，革命胜利的前途未免渺茫得很。”毛泽东同志说：“所以有这种抓住表面抛弃实质的观察，是因为他们对于一般情况的实质并没有科学地加以分析。”同样，我们有些同志，尽管口头上也承认当前总的形势是非常之好的，但往往在进行某项具体工作时，碰到了一些暂时性、局部性的困难，就把这个总的形势忘却了，以为克服困难的可能性简直是“渺茫得很”。因为他们采取了“这种抓住表面抛弃实质的观察”，所以，他们也就不能够善于利用当前的大好形势去充分调动广大群众的社会主义的积极性，不能充分发挥作为一个革命者的主观能动作用，而只晓得在困难面前唉声叹气。我们的事业在胜利地前进，广大的人民在胜利地前进，他们却背着悲观主义的包袱，蹒跚地落在后面。如果这些同志还不清醒过来，用毛泽东同志在“星星之火，可以燎原”这篇通信中以及在其他著作中所阐明的观点来纠正自己的脑筋，他们又能去责怪谁呢？
    毛泽东同志在“星星之火，可以燎原”这篇通信中，对如何透过现象把握实质，作了最生动的示范。其中最主要的一点，就是他从整体出发，分析当时敌我双方各个侧面的矛盾，而又把这些矛盾联在一起，这个矛盾引起另一个矛盾，每一对矛盾又都有其主导方面，这些矛盾又在斗争中互相转化，由此就在科学分析的基础上，提出了一整套的适合于当时具体情况的斗争策略，把革命群众的主观能动作用充分地调动起来，去促使矛盾迅速向有利于我的方向转化。因而，毛泽东同志就得出了那时的“星星之火”，很快就“可以燎原”的结论；得出革命高潮就快要到来的结论。正因为这是一种科学的分析，这“快要”二字，就决不是“可望而不可即的一种空的东西”，而是“站在海岸遥望海中已经看得见桅杆尖头了的一只航船”，是“立于高山之巅远看东方已见光芒四射喷薄欲出的一轮朝日”，是“躁动于母腹中的快要成熟了的一个婴儿”。今天，我们在胜利地进行着社会主义的革命和建设，我们应该学习毛泽东同志这样的去分析形势，具体分析我们在阶级斗争中和生产斗争中的各种矛盾，分析各种矛盾之间的相互影响，抓住事物发展的主流，透过现象，把握实质，千百倍地重视发挥广大人民的革命的主观能动作用，促使矛盾更迅速地向有利于我的方向转化。从而不断地反右倾，不断地鼓干劲，粉碎国内外敌人的一切阴谋和诽谤，在各条战线上，为高速度地多快好省地建设社会主义而斗争！正当1960年喜气洋洋地到来的时候，我们应当用毛泽东同志所教导我们的革命乐观主义的精神来迎接它。
    让我们高举毛泽东思想旗帜奋勇前进，让革命的烈火更加旺盛的燃烧吧！
