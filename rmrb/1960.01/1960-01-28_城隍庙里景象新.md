    A New Look for the City God Temple
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Ye Shitao, Xi Jinfen

    As the Spring Festival approaches, the famous small commodity market of the Old City God Temple in Shanghai is once again entering its most bustling time of the year.

    This ancient market, with nearly a century of history, has become younger. The streets are neat and clean, with many large stores appearing on both sides, their facades newly painted and particularly eye-catching. Children's dragon swords and spears, lifelike colorful silk flowers, smiling cloth dolls, and various kinds of gongs, drums, and stringed and woodwind instruments… fill the shelves. Despite the piercing cold wind, customers still stream into the market.

    We visited the state-owned Old City God Temple Daily Necessities Wholesale Department. Liu Zhongfu, the party branch secretary of the wholesale department, and others told us that the prosperity of the City God Temple market like this year is unprecedented. The number of small commodities currently supplied has reached more than 11,000, more than in any previous year. Among them, there are more than 500 kinds of headbands for women alone. The turnover of the 23 stores under the wholesale department in the first and middle ten days of January this year has increased tenfold compared with the same period last year. Before liberation, this place was concentrated with gambling dens, incense and candle shops, and fortune-telling halls. Bureaucrats, landlords, bosses, and gangsters committed all kinds of evil deeds outside and came here to squander and waste, creating a deformed prosperity in the market. Today, these types of shops have either closed down or changed their business, and the industries of handicrafts needed by the people have developed.

    We saw some small items in the City God Temple that are not easy to buy in large stores outside. For example, needle threaders for housewives to use for sewing, hairpins for old ladies to insert in their buns, sack needles for mending sacks, and dry tobacco pipes favored by elderly farmers... These are mostly produced in the temple's factories. Integrating industry and commerce, self-production and self-sales was originally the business characteristic of the City God Temple market, and now it has been further developed. Especially in the past six months, three relatively large factories have been established, specializing in the manufacture of well-known ivory, plastic products, and children's toys. Some famous fan, brush, and hardware stores have also attached small workshops, replacing the previous scattered and simple small workshops.

    The current City God Temple market not only has many commodities but also has good service attitudes. As soon as you walk into the gate of the City God Temple, you can see a red cloth banner hanging high, with a row of eight eye-catching characters on it: "Greet with a smile, be warm and attentive." This is the slogan they recently put forward to do a good job in the Spring Festival supply. Many stores also have similar signs hanging. During the visit, we heard many examples of commercial personnel being considerate and caring for customers. The clerk in the jewelry store sews buttons for customers on the spot; puts a bow on the newly bought headband for the little girl; if the item the customer wants to buy is temporarily out of stock, it will be delivered to the door immediately after it arrives. Because of the good service attitude, many salespersons have been praised by customers. Before liberation, this was not the case. The fraudulent business style of the City God Temple vendors made customers fearful. If there were spots on the washbasin, they would write a price tag on it with a brush; if there were cracks on the glass, they would draw some flowers and birds on it; if there were flaws on the socks, they would put on a colored trademark to make it difficult for customers to see. Now, of course, this kind of "trick" is gone.

    城隍庙里景象新
    新华社记者　叶世涛　奚锦芬
    随着春节的临近，上海老城隍庙这个著名的小商品市场，又到了一年一度最热闹的时候。
    这个有着近百年历史的古老市场，变得年轻了。街道整齐干净，两旁出现了不少大商店，门面油漆一新，格外惹人注目。小孩玩耍的龙刀龙枪，形象逼真的彩色绢花，喜笑盈盈的布娃娃，各式各样的锣鼓、丝竹乐器……布满货架。尽管朔风凛冽，市场里顾客仍然络绎不绝。
    我们访问了国营老城隍庙日用品批发部。批发部的党支部书记柳忠富等告诉我们：城隍庙市场像今年这样兴旺是过去所没有的。现在供应的小商品达到了一万一千多种，比过去任何一年都要多。其中，仅妇女们用的头带就有五百多种。批发部下面二十三家商店，今年1月上、中旬的营业额，比去年同期竟增加了十倍。解放以前，这里集中着赌具店、香烛店、命相馆。官僚、地主、老板、流氓，在外面为非作歹，到这里来挥霍浪费，造成市场畸形的繁荣。今天，这类商店关门的关门，改行的改行，人民需要的那些手工业品的行业发展了。
    我们在城隍庙看到了一些外面大商店里不易买到的小东西。譬如，家庭妇女做针线用的针箍，老太太插在发髻上的发钗，修补麻袋用的袋针，老年农民喜爱的旱烟筒……。这些大多是庙里的工场生产的。亦工亦商、自产自销，原来就是城隍庙市场的经营特色，现在又有了进一步发扬。特别是近半年来，设立了三个比较大的工场，专门制造素负盛誉的牙骨、塑料制品和儿童玩具。一些著名的扇子、毛笔、五金等商店，也都附设了小作场，代替了以前那些分散简陋的小作坊。
    现在的城隍庙市场，不但商品多，而且服务态度好。走进城隍庙大门，就可以看到高高挂着的一条红布横幅，上面一排八个醒目的大字：“笑脸相迎，热情周到”。这是他们最近为了做好春节供应提出来的口号。许多商店里，也挂着类似的标语牌。在访问的时候，我们听到不少商业人员体贴顾客，关心顾客的事例。饰品店营业员给顾客当场配钉钮扣；替小姑娘用新买的头带打上蝴蝶结，如果顾客要买的东西暂时没有备货，货到后就立刻送上门去。因为服务态度好，许多营业员得到了顾客的表扬。解放以前可不这样，城隍庙商贩的欺诈经营作风，使顾客望而生畏。脸盆上有斑点，他们用毛笔写上一个价目；玻璃杯上有裂纹，就画上一些花鸟；袜子上有疵点，便贴上一张彩色商标；使顾客看不出来。现在，这种“戏法”当然再也没有了。
