    Such "Peaceful Intentions"
    As the old year gives way to the new, it is once again the time for the US President to deliver his annual "State of the Union Address" to Congress. In this so-called "yearly self-examination," Eisenhower devoted most of the space to "examining" America's foreign relations, which is not difficult to understand; because it was precisely in the past year that the United States, to a greater and more helpless extent, acknowledged the relentless reality of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, and was forced to make more "easing" gestures in its foreign relations than in any previous year. From the mouths of American officials, starting with Eisenhower, people have recently heard a lot of talk about easing international tensions, resolving international disputes through negotiation, and even engaging in peaceful competition between the two systems. The US President also made a "peaceful goodwill" visit to eleven countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa. In short, for months, the American ruling figures have said a great deal of "gentle and beautiful" words, and people have every reason to expect that the US President, in his "State of the Union Address" concerning the trend of domestic and foreign policies for the coming year, will be able to demonstrate some willingness to translate peaceful words into actions.
    However, anyone with a clear mind, after reading Eisenhower's address, would find it difficult to come to the conclusion that, as he said in his address: "We (referring to the United States) must keep our word." In fact, even in the same address, Eisenhower made "pleasant promises" on the one hand, and on the other hand, could not wait to announce the actions he intended to take, and the latter is precisely the negation of the former.
    For example, the US President expressed at the beginning of his address his determination to be "devoted to the cause of peace," which is indeed a "pleasant promise." For many years, the war clouds and tense atmosphere stirred up by the "strength" policy of the US authorities have been unanimously condemned by the world; now that it has announced its determination to be "devoted to the cause of peace," how can people not welcome it? However, Eisenhower, just seconds after saying this, immediately declared that the United States should "devote any strength" to provide "real deterrent power," and became ecstatic in flaunting America's "deterrent power": he said that America's "Atlas" intercontinental missiles "are already usable," and their accuracy is said to be able to "hit targets less than two miles away"; he said that America's "long-range strike force is unmatched in manned bombers"; he also said that America's missile-equipped nuclear submarines "can accurately hit targets almost anywhere on earth"; he announced that the United States, in its budget for the next fiscal year, will keep military spending "at the highest level in peacetime in the past few years," and so on. Here, without discussing how much value all these talks about "deterrent power" have, and who they can scare, they have at least played one role, which is: to expose the trick of the so-called US being "devoted to the cause of peace!" While lavishly talking about peace, while waving missiles and nuclear weapons, what could be more disharmonious than this?
    For example, Eisenhower declared that "the United States has always been prepared to discuss seriously with the Soviet Union" issues related to the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and disarmament "or any other issue that may lead to a just peace." If that is really the case, of course, that would be great. However, Eisenhower unambiguously stated in regard to the actions that the US government intends to take that he is actually not serious when he says this. First of all, he disregarded the well-known fact that it is precisely because of the consistent obstruction of the United States that negotiations on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and disarmament issues have stalled, and groundlessly placed the responsibility on the Soviet Union. The United States does not even have the most basic respect for facts, so how can it be expected to conduct negotiations with a serious attitude? This can only show that the United States intends to continue to obstruct future negotiations. It is particularly noteworthy that Eisenhower, in his address, did not indicate at all what "serious" specific efforts the United States is prepared to make to resolve major international disputes in order to ease international tensions. He avoided talking about major issues such as the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the West Berlin issue, and the issue of the United States' occupation of Taiwan, nor did he talk about what kind of contribution the United States will make to future East-West summit meetings. Not only that, Eisenhower also openly announced that "while negotiating on disarmament issues, we (referring to the United States) must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness"; this is the same as his announcement at the end of last year that the United States is free to resume nuclear weapons testing at any time during the cessation of nuclear testing negotiations. The United States, on the one hand, conducts negotiations, and on the other hand, actively carries out activities that are completely contrary to the goals of the negotiations, which not only does not create a good atmosphere for the negotiations, but deliberately deteriorates the atmosphere of the negotiations. Where is there half a point of seriousness in this? According to Reuters, diplomatic observers in London pointed out that Eisenhower's revelation of the precision of the "Atlas" intercontinental missile "means that the West will attend the summit meeting with a feeling of increased defensive strength." This also helps people understand whether the United States is treating the negotiations with a serious attitude or attempting to obstruct the negotiations with blackmail tactics.
    Eisenhower, in his address, once again emphasized his so-called "collective defense system" and continued to maintain US military bases overseas. This is obviously not a clever way to express America's "peaceful intentions," because in today's reality, only idiots would think that America's military blocs and bases are not aggressive but so-called defensive. The US authorities, while lavishly talking about easing international tensions, openly announce that they will continue to strengthen the aggressive military blocs and military bases that are precisely contributing to international tensions. May I ask, how can people believe in the peaceful intentions of the US authorities?
    Eisenhower even openly slandered communist and socialist countries in his address. This malicious slander is particularly incompatible with his expressed "peace" sincerity. This is completely a "Cold War" tune. However, just as Eisenhower cursed Marxism as "not the gospel of the future" in his "State of the Union Address" last year, and the result could not stop Marxism from achieving great victories in 1959, his slander of communist and socialist countries in this year's address will certainly not make the capitalist world prosper. Eisenhower admitted that the "competition conducted" by the socialist camp "cannot be taken lightly," which shows that he still has some sense of reality after all. Indeed, the strength of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union in the struggle to defend the cause of peace cannot be taken lightly by anyone, and the firm will of the people of the world to demand the easing of tensions cannot be taken lightly either. Bankrupt "deterrent power" and the universally hated "Cold War" language will never help Eisenhower explain any peaceful intentions. Therefore, after reading Eisenhower's address, people can only come to this reaction: the US ruling authorities should talk less about worthless "deterrent power" and do something that is really conducive to easing international tensions.

### 如此“和平意图”

专栏：观察家评论

    如此“和平意图”
    岁序更新，又到了美国总统向国会提出一年一度的“国情咨文”的时候了。艾森豪威尔在他这一篇自己所谓的“每年一次的自我检查”中，用了大部分的篇幅来“检查”美国的对外关系，这是不难理解的；因为正是在刚刚过去的一年中，美国在更大和更无可奈何的程度上默认了东风压倒西风的无情现实，而被迫在它的对外关系上作出了比以往任何一年更多的“缓和”姿态。从艾森豪威尔以下的美国官员的嘴里，人们近来听到了不少关于缓和国际紧张局势、谈判来解决国际争端、甚至关于在两个制度之间进行和平竞赛的谈论。美国总统还进行了对欧、亚、非洲十一国的“和平亲善”访问。总之，几个月来，美国统治人物把“温柔而漂亮”的话已经说了一大堆，人们有一切理由期待美国总统在有关今后一年的内外政策动向的“国情咨文”里，能够表现出一些把和平言论见诸行动的意愿。
    但是，任何头脑清醒的人在读了艾森豪威尔的咨文之后，都很难得出这样的结论，即像他在咨文中所说的：“我们（指美国）必须遵守我们说过的话。”事实上，就是在这同一篇咨文中，艾森豪威尔也是一方面许下了“动听的诺言”，一方面又迫不及待地宣布他打算采取的行动，而后者正是对前者的否定。
    比如，美国总统在他的咨文中一开始就表示“致力于和平事业”的决心，这确实是一个“动听的诺言”。多少年来，美国当局的“实力”政策翻搅起来的战争乌云和紧张空气遭到了全世界的一致谴责；现在它宣布下定决心“致力于和平事业”了，人们怎能不表示欢迎呢？但是，艾森豪威尔就在说完这句话几秒钟之后，马上声明要美国“献出任何一点力量”，来提供“真正威慑力量”，而且就得意忘形地炫耀起美国的“威慑力量”来：他说什么美国的“阿特拉斯”式洲际导弹“已经可以使用”，其准确性据说能够“击中距离目标不到两英里的地方”；他说什么美国的“远距离打击力量在有人驾驶的轰炸机方面是无人匹敌的”；他还说美国的装有导弹的核潜水艇“能够准确地击中几乎地球上任何地方的目标”；他宣布美国在下一个财政年度的预算中，将使军费开支“继续保持过去几年的和平时期的最高纪录”等等，不一而足。在这里姑且不论所有这些关于“威慑力量”的谈论有多大价值，能吓唬得了谁，但它们至少起了一个作用，那就是：拆穿了所谓美国将“致力于和平事业”的把戏！一面侈谈和平，一面却又挥舞导弹和核武器，还有什么比这更不和谐的呢？
    又比如，艾森豪威尔宣称“美国一向准备同苏联一起认真讨论”有关停止核武器试验和裁军方面的问题“或其他任何可能导向正义的和平的问题”。如果真是这样，当然很好。然而艾森豪威尔在关于美国政府打算采取的行动上，毫不含糊地表明他说这句话实际上并不是认真的。首先，他不顾众所周知的事实，即正是由于美国的一贯阻挠才使得关于停止核武器试验和裁军问题的谈判陷于停滞状态，而毫无根据地把责任推到苏联身上。美国对事实连最起码的尊重都没有，又怎能期待它以认真的态度来进行谈判呢？这只能说明美国在今后的谈判中企图继续进行阻挠的用心。特别值得注意的是，艾森豪威尔在他的咨文中完全没有表明美国准备作出哪些“认真的”具体努力来解决重大的国际争端，以缓和国际紧张局势。他避而不谈例如缔结对德和约问题、西柏林问题、美国军队侵占台湾问题等重大问题，也没有谈到美国将对未来的东西方最高级会议作出何种贡献。不但如此，艾森豪威尔还公然宣布“在谈判裁军问题的同时，我们（指美国）必须保持高度的军事效能”；这和他在去年年底宣布在停止核试验谈判期间美国随时有恢复核武器试验的自由，是同出一辙的。美国一方面进行谈判，一方面又积极进行同谈判的目标完全背道而驰的活动，不但不为谈判创造良好的气氛，反而蓄意恶化谈判的气氛，这哪里有半点认真可言呢？据路透社报道，伦敦的外交观察家就指出，艾森豪威尔透露“阿特拉斯”式洲际导弹的精确程度，是“意味着西方将抱着一种感到防御力量增加的情绪参加最高级会议。”这也有助于人们了解，美国究竟是以认真的态度对待谈判，还是企图以讹诈的手法来阻挠谈判。
    艾森豪威尔在他的咨文中再一次强调他所谓的“集体防御体系”和继续保持美国在海外的军事基地，这显然不是表示美国“和平意图”的高明做法，因为在今天的现实生活中，只有白痴才会认为美国的那些军事集团和基地不是侵略性的而是所谓防御性的了。美国当局一面侈谈缓和国际紧张局势，一面却公开宣布要继续加强正是促成国际紧张局势的侵略性军事集团和军事基地。试问，人们又怎能相信美国当局的和平意图呢？
    艾森豪威尔在他的咨文中甚至公然污蔑共产主义和社会主义国家，这种恶意诽谤同他所表示的“和平”诚意尤其是不调和的。这完全是一种“冷战”论调。但是，正像艾森豪威尔在他去年的“国情咨文”中诅咒马克思主义“不是未来的福音”，结果并不能阻挡马克思主义在1959年取得伟大胜利一样，他在今年的咨文中对共产主义和社会主义国家的诽谤，也肯定不可能使资本主义世界兴旺起来。艾森豪威尔承认社会主义阵营所“进行的竞争是不可轻侮的”，这表明他毕竟还有一些现实感。的确，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营在保卫和平事业的斗争上所具有的力量是不容任何人轻侮的，全世界人民要求缓和紧张局势的坚强意志也是不可轻侮的。破了产的“威慑力量”和人人厌恶的“冷战”语言，是绝不会帮助艾森豪威尔说明什么和平意图的。因此，人们在读了艾森豪威尔的咨文之后，只能得出这样的反应：美国统治当局应该少谈些不值一文的“威慑力量”，做一点真正有利于缓和国际紧张局势的事情。
