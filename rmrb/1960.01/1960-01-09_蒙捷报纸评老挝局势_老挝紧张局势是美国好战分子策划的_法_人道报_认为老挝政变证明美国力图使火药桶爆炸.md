Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, January 8th. The Mongolian newspaper "Unen" ("Truth") published a commentary today on the current situation in Laos, saying that the reactionary clique called the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" in Laos, acting on the instructions of U.S. warmongers, launched a coup d'état, completely abandoning the Geneva Agreements and Vientiane Agreements on Laos. The situation in Laos not only brings disaster to the Laotian people but also expands the threat to neighboring countries, creating new tensions in Southeast Asia.

The commentary emphasized that the culprit responsible for the unfortunate events in Laos is the U.S. warmongers who instigated the revival of the most reactionary clique in Laos.

For eight months, U.S. imperialism and the leaders of the Southeast Asia military bloc have been actively planning to aggravate the tension in Laos.

The commentary said that the Laotian people are facing arduous tasks of struggle. The Mongolian people believe that the Laotian people can eliminate the serious situation at home and develop the country along a peaceful path. The Mongolian people, like the people of other Asian countries, demand the immediate elimination of the tension threatening the safety of the Laotian and other countries' people.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 8th. The Czechoslovak newspaper "Rudé právo" ("Red Right") published a commentary today on the situation in Laos, saying that the fact that the heads of the reactionary officer group in Laos control the Laotian government may lead to disastrous developments. The commentary emphasized that the most reactionary Laotian soldiers, closely colluding with U.S. imperialism and advocating the continuation of the civil war and participation in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, have seized power, which has not only failed to dissipate the dark clouds over Laos but has thickened them.

The commentary reviewed the developments in the country since July last year and said that the current situation in Laos gives unlimited power to the army group.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 8th. The French newspaper "l'Humanité" published a commentary on the recent military coup launched by the extremely pro-American Laotian "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" warlord group, saying that just when people are talking about peace, Americans who miss the "Cold War" are trying to find sparks to explode a powder keg. The military coup in Laos is proof of this.

The commentary, written by Jacques Kahn and published on the 6th, pointed out that the dictatorial "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" generals are the most radical instigators. Their program is to wage civil war against the people; to carry out terrorist suppression against the former Lao fighting forces; and to carry out provocative activities against neighboring countries such as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The commentary said: France is a signatory to the Geneva Accords and is responsible for Laos' compliance with the agreements. It has a responsibility to remind Laos to comply. On the other hand, France, like Britain and the United States, is also a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the new dictators in Vientiane are counting on this organization.

The commentary called for international pressure to force the Laotian adventurers to retreat.

    蒙捷报纸评老挝局势
    老挝紧张局势是美国好战分子策划的
    法“人道报”认为老挝政变证明美国力图使火药桶爆炸
    新华社乌兰巴托8日电　蒙古“真理报”今天就老挝目前局势发表评论说，所谓老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”这个反动集团，按照美国好战分子的指示，发动政变，完全背弃了关于老挝的日内瓦协议和万象协议。老挝局势不仅给老挝人民带来灾难，而且扩大了对邻国的威胁，制造了东南亚新的紧张局势。
    评论着重指出，制造老挝不幸事件的祸首是策动复活老挝最反动集团的美国好战分子。
    八个月来，美帝国主义和东南亚军事集团的负责人就在积极策划加剧老挝的紧张局势。
    评论说，老挝人民面临着艰巨的斗争任务。蒙古人民相信，老挝人民能够消除国内的严重局势，使国家沿着和平的道路发展。蒙古人民和其他亚洲国家人民一样，要求立即消除威胁老挝和其他国家人民安全的紧张局势。
    新华社布拉格8日电　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”今天就老挝局势发表评论说，老挝的反动军官集团首脑控制老挝政府这一事实，可能促成灾难性的发展。评论强调指出，同美帝国主义紧紧勾结在一起，并且主张继续打内战和参加东南亚条约组织的最反动的老挝军人夺取了政权，这使老挝上空的阴云不但没有消散，反而更浓密了。
    评论回顾了去年7月以来，这个国家的事态发展后说，老挝目前的形势使陆军集团取得无限的权力。
    据新华社巴黎8日电　法国“人道报”就极端亲美的老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的军阀集团最近发动的军事政变发表评论说，正当人们谈论和平的时候，怀念“冷战”的美国人正在竭力寻求星星之火来使火药桶爆炸。老挝的军事政变就是一个证明。
    这篇在6日发表的由雅克·堪恩写的评论指出，独裁的“保卫国家利益委员会”的将军们都是最激烈的点火者。他们的纲领是要对人民进行内战；对前寮国战斗部队进行恐怖镇压；对越南民主共和国等邻国进行挑衅活动。
    评论说：法国是日内瓦协定的签字国，对老挝遵守协定负有责任。它有责任提醒老挝遵守。另一方面，法国同英、美两国一样，也是东南亚条约组织的成员国，而万象的新独裁者正是指望着这个组织。
    评论要求施加国际压力，迫使老挝的冒险者退却。
