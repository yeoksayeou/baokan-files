Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 9th: TASS, Moscow, January 9th: The Soviet Foreign Ministry, through diplomatic channels, delivered the TASS communiqué of January 8th regarding the Soviet Union's planned rocket launches into the central Pacific region for scientific research purposes to the governments of various countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 9th: TASS reports: A spokesman for the Soviet Ministry of Maritime Transport today clarified the area where the Soviet Union's new powerful rocket is expected to land.

The Ministry of Maritime Transport spokesman said that the area is far from frequent shipping lanes and islands. It covers an area of approximately 43,000 square nautical miles, with a depth of over 5,000 meters. The islands located here are all coral islands.

The distance from the rocket landing area to the nearest Palmyra Island (atoll) is approximately 250 nautical miles, and to another atoll (Johnston Atoll) is 400 nautical miles. Furthermore, there are no other landmasses closer than that. The fauna and flora in this part of the Pacific are sparse, so there are hardly any fishing boats here. The Pacific is well-known for its typhoons, but typhoons are rare in this area. However, tropical downpours can be seen here.

    苏联外交部把发射火箭公报交给各国
    海运部发言人指出火箭预定降落区远离频繁航道和岛屿
    新华社莫斯科9日电　据塔斯社莫斯科9日讯：苏联外交部通过外交途径把塔斯社8日关于苏联根据科学研究计划将向太平洋中部地区发射火箭的公报交给了各国政府。
    新华社莫斯科9日电　据塔斯社报道：苏联海运部发言人今天对苏联新的强大火箭即将降落的区域作了说明。
    海运部发言人说，这个区域距频繁的航道和岛屿很远。它的面积大约是四万三千平方浬，深度在五千米以上。位于这里的岛屿都是珊瑚岛。
    从火箭降落地区至最近的巴尔米拉岛（环礁）大约为二百五十浬，至另外的一个环礁（约翰斯顿）为四百浬。此外，没有距离更近的其他陆地部分。太平洋的这部分动物群和植物群都是很少的，因此几乎没有渔船到这里。太平洋的台风很著名，但是，这个地区台风很罕见。可是，在这里可以看到热带的暴雨。
