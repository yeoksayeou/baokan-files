    Looking at Mountain Area Construction from the Perspective of Pingshun
    A commentator from this newspaper
    Mountain areas account for a considerable proportion of each province in our country. Therefore, mountain area construction occupies a very important position in the socialist construction of the whole country. Precisely because of this, the Party Central Committee and Party committees at all levels have always attached importance to the construction of mountain areas, and have shown meticulous care for the people in mountain areas.
    Under the correct leadership and meticulous care of the Party Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, mountain area construction, like other parts of the country, has advanced by leaps and bounds, and tremendous changes have taken place. Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, which is reported in this newspaper today, is a typical example.
    In the old society, Pingshun County was known as a poor place lacking all five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The so-called lack of all five elements meant that there were no minerals, a lack of trees, a lack of water sources, no coal, and even very little soil. In such an area, each person had an average of less than two mu of cultivated land. However, the diligent and courageous 130,000 people of Pingshun County, under the strong leadership of Party committees at all levels, have not only comprehensively developed agricultural production in a short period of time, but also greatly developed industrial production, with people's incomes gradually increasing and living conditions gradually improving. In 1959, the average yield of grain per mu in Pingshun County reached more than 400 jin, realizing the targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule. Water conservancy construction has also greatly developed, with irrigated land reaching 70% of the total cultivated area. Sheep have increased to 150,000, more than one per person; pigs have increased to more than 40,000, more than one per household. 890,000 mu of forests have been planted, an average of seven mu per person; more than 200 million trees have been planted, including 36.55 million mu of dried fruit trees. The people of Pingshun County, who had never seen apples for generations, have also been able to eat apples they have cultivated themselves in recent years. In 1959, the total agricultural output value of the county reached 15 million yuan, the total industrial output value reached 3.6 million yuan, and the average income per person in the county was 108 yuan, an increase of 40.3% compared with 1958. 88% of the young and middle-aged people in the county have shaken off the label of illiteracy, and 25,000 primary and secondary school students are studying in schools. It is particularly worth mentioning that the people of Pingshun County have summed up many successful experiences from their practice of building socialism. These construction experiences are very valuable and worthy of promotion.
    The experience of Pingshun County tells us that mountain areas have unlimited potential and can carry out economic construction at high speed. Comparing mountain areas with plain areas, the natural conditions in plain areas are superior to those in mountain areas, such as more land, more water sources, more labor, and relatively developed transportation. However, mountain areas also have their own superior conditions, such as more mountains, wider slopes, more grass, and more wild plants, which are conducive to the development of forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. Many mountain areas are rich in minerals, which are conducive to the development of industry. These conditions are not available or not fully available in plain areas. It should be said that plain areas and mountain areas each have their own advantages and bright futures. What is particularly worth emphasizing is people, which is the decisive factor in economic construction. "Poverty leads to the desire for change." Because the people in mountain areas are poor, their desire for change is more urgent, and this is a huge driving force for the high-speed development of the mountain economy. The responsibility of the leadership is to be good at mobilizing the masses, inspiring the construction enthusiasm of the masses, and organizing the masses in a timely manner to devote themselves to the great struggle to transform the mountain areas. In a short time, we can build poor and backward mountain areas into beautiful and rich places.
    The experience of Pingshun County also tells us that mountain area construction must implement the policy of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery are mutually complementary and mutually promoting. In mountain areas, the manure of livestock is also the best feed for crops. In places with more livestock, agricultural production develops faster. At the same time, the development of animal husbandry can also greatly increase income. For example, raising a pig that produces 100 jin of meat can earn 60 yuan; raising three fine wool sheep can also earn 60 yuan a year. Developing forestry is an effective way to conserve soil and water, and conserving soil and water is a fundamental guarantee for increasing grain production. The experience of Pingshun County fully proves this point. In 1959, Pingshun County not only achieved continued great leap forward in grain production, but also made great progress in forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations.
    May all the people in the mountain areas, in socialist construction, go all out, aim high, and build the mountain areas into a prosperous and beautiful paradise. (Attached picture)

    从平顺看山区建设
    本报评论员
    山区，在我国各省都占有相当大的比重。因此，山区建设在全国的社会主义建设中，占有十分重要的地位。正是由于这样，党中央和各级党委，对于建设山区从来是重视的，对于山区人民的关怀更是无微不至。
    在党中央和各级党委的正确领导和无微不至的关怀下，山区建设与全国各地一样飞跃前进，发生了翻天复地的变化。本报今天所报道的山西省平顺县，就是一个典型例子。
    平顺县在旧社会是被称为金木水火土五行俱缺的穷地方。所谓五行俱缺，就是没有矿石，缺少树木，缺少水源，没有煤炭，连土也很少。在这样的地区，每人平均不到二亩耕地。但是，勤劳勇敢的平顺县的十三万人民，在各级党委的坚强领导下，在短短的时间内，不仅全面地发展了农业生产，而且大大地发展了工业生产，人民收入逐渐增加，生活逐步改善。1959年平顺县的粮食平均亩产量已达到四百多斤，提前八年实现了全国农业发展纲要所规定的指标。水利建设也有很大发展，水浇地已达到总耕地面积的70％。羊发展到十五万只，每人平均一只多；猪发展到四万多头，每户平均一头多。造林八十九万亩，每人平均七亩；植树两亿株以上，其中干水果树三千六百五十五万亩。世世代代没有见过苹果的平顺人民，这几年也吃上了自己培植的苹果。1959年全县农业总产值达到一千五百万元，工业总产值达到三百六十万元，全县每人平均收入一百零八元，比1958年增长了40．3％。全县有88％的青壮年脱掉文盲帽子，有二万五千名中小学生在学校读书。特别值得提出的是，平顺县的人民从自己建设社会主义的实践中，总结出许许多多的成功经验。这些建设经验是十分宝贵的，值得推广的。
    平顺县的经验告诉我们：山区蕴藏着无穷的潜力，可以高速度地进行经济建设。拿山区和平川地区作比较，平川地区的自然条件是比山区优越，如土地多，水源多，劳动力多，交通比较发达等。但是山区也有自己的优越条件，如山多、坡宽、草多、野生植物多，便于发展林业、牧业、副业，许多山区矿产丰富，便于发展工业，这些条件又是平川地区所不具备或不完全具备的。应该说，平川地区和山区是各有千秋，各有光明前途。特别值得重视的是人，这是经济建设的决定因素。“穷则思变”。山区人民正因为穷，要求变的心情更迫切，而这正是高速度发展山区经济的巨大动力。领导的责任，就是要善于发动群众，启发群众的建设热情，并及时地把群众组织起来，投入改造山区的伟大斗争，不用很长时间，我们就可以把贫穷落后的山区建设成美丽富饶的地方。
    平顺县的经验还告诉我们：山区建设必须贯彻执行农林牧副渔全面发展的方针。农林牧副渔五业是相辅相成、互相促进的。在山区，牲畜的粪便同样是农作物的最好的食料，牲畜多的地方，农业生产就发展得快。同时，畜牧业发展了，还可以大大增加收入。例如，养一头出肉一百斤的猪，就可以收入六十元；养三只细羊毛，一年也可收入六十元。发展林业是保持水土的有效办法，而保持水土也是增加粮食产量的根本保证。平顺县的经验完全证明了这一点。1959年平顺县不仅仅粮食生产获得了继续大跃进的成绩，而且林、牧、副业也有很大发展。
    愿一切山区人民，在社会主义建设中鼓足干劲，力争上游，把山区建设成富庶、美丽的乐园。（附图片）
