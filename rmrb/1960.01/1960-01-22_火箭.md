    Rocket
    A rocket is a type of aircraft that can be used to transport objects to a predetermined location or to achieve a predetermined speed. Examples include carrier rockets for artificial satellites and intercontinental rockets for launching intercontinental ballistic missiles. The characteristic of this type of aircraft is that it uses a rocket engine as its propulsion device. When a rocket engine operates, it ejects high-speed gas backward, thereby generating a powerful reaction force (thrust) that enables the rocket to overcome resistance during its forward motion, continuously increasing its speed and moving forward. This is similar to a jet aircraft, which also uses a reaction engine. However, a jet aircraft requires oxygen from the air for combustion in its engine to eject high-speed gas. Therefore, it cannot function without air. The oxygen required by a rocket, on the other hand, is contained within the fuel it carries, allowing it to fly in a vacuum outside the atmosphere. Launching artificial satellites, space rockets, and future space travel all occur outside the Earth's atmosphere, so rockets must be used.
    Multi-stage rockets: These are "rocket trains" composed of several rockets arranged sequentially. Each stage of the rocket has its own engine and fuel. When the fuel of one stage is exhausted, it no longer generates thrust, and its engine and fuel tank become burdens on the other stages as they continue to move forward. Therefore, it is separated from the entire "train" to allow the engine of the next stage to start working, and the rocket continues to accelerate. This process continues until the final stage, allowing the transported object to reach a higher speed. Artificial satellites and space rockets are generally launched using multi-stage rockets. After the final stage of the rocket has completed its work, the rocket's speed reaches its maximum, and it no longer accelerates. Therefore, the final stage is often not separated but remains integrated with the transported object. The Soviet Union's launched space rockets flew with the final stage attached.
    Ballistic rockets: The characteristic of a ballistic rocket is that after the rocket engine pushes the entire rocket to a certain altitude and achieves a certain speed, the rocket freely flies along a ballistic trajectory (no longer propelled by power) towards the target. Its entire trajectory can be divided into three stages: the active phase (or acceleration phase), the free flight phase, and the recovery and stabilization phase.
    Rocket thrust: This refers to the reaction force generated when a rocket engine operates. The magnitude of the thrust indicates the power of the rocket. The greater the thrust, the larger the object that can be sent further and faster.
    Rocket accuracy: This refers to whether the rocket can deliver the transported object to the predetermined location on time or achieve the specified speed. This is primarily determined by the accuracy of the rocket's flight direction. Therefore, a control system is often added to the rocket to control and correct the rocket's flight direction, making it a controllable rocket. In addition, the accuracy of the rocket also depends on the accuracy of the operation of each stage of the rocket engine, whether it starts and separates on time, and whether the thrust reaches the predetermined magnitude. The rocket's shape, size, and weight also have a certain impact.

    火箭
    火箭　火箭是一种飞行器，可以用来将一定的物体运送到预定的地方，或达到预定的速度。如人造卫星的运载火箭，发射洲际导弹的洲际火箭。这种飞行器的特点就是用火箭发动机作为它的推进装置。火箭发动机工作时向后喷射出高速度的气流，由此产生强大的反作用力（推力），使火箭克服前进中的阻力，不断的增加速度，向前飞行。这与喷气式飞机一样都是用反作用式的发动机，但喷气式飞机需要用空气中的氧在它的发动机中燃烧，才能喷出高速气流，因此离开了空气就不能工作。而火箭所需要的氧却包含在它自己所携带的燃料中，可以离开大气而在真空中飞行。发射人造卫星、宇宙火箭以及将来的宇宙航行都是在地球大气层以外飞行，因此，必须采用火箭。
    多级火箭这是由好几级火箭依次组合起来的“火箭列车”。每一级火箭都有自己的发动机和燃料。当一级火箭的燃料用完以后就不再产生推力，它的发动机和燃料箱反而成为其他几级火箭继续前进的负担。因此将它从整个“列车”中分离开，使下一级火箭的发动机开始工作，火箭就继续加速。依次下去，直到最后一级，可以使被运送的物体达到更高的速度。人造卫星和宇宙火箭一般都是利用多级火箭发射的。最后一级火箭工作完了以后，火箭的速度达到最大，不再加速，因此最后一级往往不再分离而与运送的物体联成一体。苏联发射的宇宙火箭就是带着最后一级飞行的。
    弹道火箭　弹道火箭的特征是，当火箭发动机把整个火箭推到一定的高度并使它达到一定速度后，火箭就按照惯性沿着弹道曲线自由飞行（不再由动力推动），奔向目标。它的整个轨道可分为三个阶段：主动段（或称加速段）、自由飞行段和收复稳定状态段。
    火箭的推力　是指火箭发动机工作时产生的反作用力。推力的大小表明火箭的强大程度。推力越大，就可以将更大的物体送得更远，飞得更快。
    火箭的准确性　这是指火箭能否将运送的物体准时送到预定的地方，或达到规定的速度。这首先决定于火箭飞行方向的准确性。因此往往在火箭中加上一套控制系统，来掌握和修正火箭的飞行方向，而成为可操纵的火箭。此外，火箭的准确性还决定于各级火箭发动机工作的准确性，是否按时开车和分离，推力是否达到预定的大小。而火箭的外形、尺寸和重量等也都有一定的影响。
