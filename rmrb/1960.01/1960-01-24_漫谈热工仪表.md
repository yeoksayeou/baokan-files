    A Casual Discussion on Thermal Instrumentation
    Wang Liangmei
    The term "thermal instrumentation" might sound unfamiliar to many people. In fact, everyone has come across it, but they just don't know what it's called. When you get on a bus, you can see a row of clock-like instruments in front of the driver, with various scales on the surface. The pointer keeps swinging between the scales, constantly reporting to its master—the driver—the driving speed and fuel consumption. If you go to a power plant, you will see even more various instruments. These instruments constantly report to the workers how high the water level in the boiler is, how well the combustion in the furnace is, and whether the generator is running normally. These instruments are all called thermal instrumentation.
    The thermal instrumentation industry has developed along with the modern industrial production's trend towards high temperature, high pressure, high speed, and automation. The instrumentation industry has only been around for more than twenty years. Initially, they were only used in production processes with thermal changes, so people called them thermal instrumentation. However, with the progress of science and technology, its use has far exceeded the scope of thermal engineering, and it has become an instrument for inspection, measurement, and control in complex industrial production processes, becoming the "nerve center" of modern industrial production processes. Therefore, people also call it "production process control instrumentation."
    The process of industrial production, from raw materials to finished products, is a series of complex changes in various material components or energy. In order to ensure that this transformation process accurately meets people's requirements, and economically and rationally produces the products we need, people must control various conditions throughout the production process and constantly understand and grasp the changing conditions of materials. For example, power generation requires controlling boiler temperature, steam pressure, and water flow. The chemical and petroleum industries need to control the concentration, viscosity, specific gravity, acidity, alkalinity, density, etc. of various liquids, and these cannot be accurately measured by the naked eye alone. Some production processes must be operated remotely, and people cannot approach them at all. This requires various instruments to constantly tell people the various changes in the production process. When a failure occurs, the instrument can automatically issue an alarm or automatically control it.
    Due to the progress of science and technology, the types of thermal instrumentation (production process control instrumentation) are increasing and becoming more precise. In recent years, many instruments using the latest technological achievements have emerged, such as ultrasonic, ultra-short wave, and radioactive isotope instruments. They can measure high temperatures up to 2,000 degrees Celsius and withstand high pressures of 2,000 kilograms per square centimeter. Some instruments can also perform non-contact measurements. The instrumentation industry is developing rapidly, and the measurement and adjustment of instruments have been combined with electronic computers for comprehensive automated control of complex production processes. It can not only replace people's eyes and ears, but also replace people's hands and brains in many aspects.

    漫谈热工仪表
    王良楣
    提起热工仪表这个名词，许多人都会感到十分陌生。其实，我们每个人都和它见过面，只是不知道它该怎么称呼罢了。当你坐上公共汽车的时候，你就可以看到驾驶员面前的一排像钟表一样的仪表，表面上有各种刻度，指针就在刻度之间不停地摆动着，时刻向它的主人——驾驶员报告行车速度、油量的耗用情况。要是你去发电厂，那么你看到的各式各样的仪表就更多。这些仪表时刻向工人们报告锅炉里的水位有多高，炉膛里燃烧得怎样，发电机运转是否正常。这些仪表，都叫做热工仪表。
    热工仪表工业是随着现代工业生产向高温、高压、高速度和自动化方向相应发展起来的。仪表工业只有二十多年历史，开初，它们只用于具有热力变化的生产过程，所以人们叫它热工仪表。但是随着科学技术的进步，它的用途已经远远超出了热工的范围，成为在复杂的工业生产过程中进行检查、测量、控制的仪器，成为现代工业生产过程的“神经中枢”，所以人们又叫它“生产过程控制仪表”。
    工业生产从原料到制成成品的过程，是各种物质成分或能量的一系列复杂变化的过程。为了保证这个转化过程准确地按照人们的要求，经济、合理地生产出我们需要的产品，人们就必须控制整个生产过程的各种条件，时刻了解掌握物质的变化状况。例如，发电要控制锅炉温度、蒸汽压力和给水流量。化工、石油工业要控制各种液体的浓度、粘度、比重、酸碱度、密度等等，而这些又不可能单靠肉眼来准确测知的。有些生产过程必须远距离操纵，人们根本不能接近。这就需要各种仪表时刻告诉人们生产过程中的各种变化，在发生故障的时候，仪表能自动发出警报，或自动控制。
    由于科学技术的进步，热工仪表（生产过程控制仪表）的种类越来越多，也越精密。最近几年，出现了许多采用最新技术成就的仪表，如超声波、超短波、放射性同位元素仪表等等。它们可以测量高达摄氏两千度的高温，每平方公分承受两千公斤的高压。有的仪表还可以进行不接触测量。仪表工业正在一日千里地发展，仪表的测量调节已经和电子计算机联合起来使用，进行复杂生产过程的综合自动化控制。它不仅可以代替人们的耳目，还可以在许多环节上代替人的手脑。
