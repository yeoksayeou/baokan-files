Short Commentary:

    In order to meet the needs of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, and to serve the great leap forward in industry, agriculture, and cultural and educational undertakings more effectively, since last year, newspaper and book printing workers across the country, under the leadership of the Party and the government, and with the strong cooperation and support of relevant parties, have actively launched the work of developing printing productive forces, aiming to establish a national newspaper and book printing network from the central to the county level, combining large, medium, and small scales, and integrating indigenous and foreign methods in the coming years. This work has achieved great success. While actively developing the printing network, a printing technology innovation movement has been widely carried out, focusing on improving printing quality, accelerating the printing speed of newspapers and books, realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization, improving production technology, and enhancing operational skills. Due to the close reliance on the leadership of the Party, the implementation of putting politics in command, and the implementation of the "walking on two legs" policy, great achievements have been made in the printing technology innovation movement. The production cycle of publications and the publishing time of newspapers have been greatly shortened, the printing quality of publications has been generally improved, and complete sets of typesetting and binding machinery combining indigenous and foreign methods have been invented and created in various places. Several thousand advanced experiences in improving technology and operation have emerged, many of which are of great significance for improving the technical level of printing production. At the same time, it has also promoted the mechanization and semi-mechanization of the printing industry. Although the innovation of printing technology has had a good start, China's modern printing technology is still relatively backward in many aspects. Many cutting-edge problems of major and critical nature in printing technology need to be further studied and resolved. Therefore, we must strive to make greater improvements in the level of printing technology in a short period.
    Strengthening the planning of printing technology innovation and the promotion of advanced experience is a very important matter in the printing technology innovation movement in the future. With planning, we can grasp the direction, clarify the goals, and arrange tasks, use forces, and organize collaboration in a planned and led manner. The main directions of the current printing technology innovation are: gradually realizing the mechanization, semi-mechanization, and automation of typesetting and binding production; vigorously improving the quality of letterpress printing; carrying forward and innovating the traditional printing technology of the motherland; and further improving color printing technology. The mechanization of typesetting and binding is the key to the rapid improvement of printing production efficiency and must be vigorously promoted. Letterpress publications account for a large proportion of publications in our country, but the quality of letterpress printing is currently a weak link. The specifications of the type molds used in various places are inconsistent, and the fonts are not uniform. They should be gradually standardized in the future. Woodcut watermarks are a traditional printing technique in our country with a strong national style, and is currently the most perfect printing method for reproducing ink paintings. In the future, we need to further improve operations, improve quality, and continue to trial-produce new products.
    Adhering to the policy of "walking on two legs" is an important guarantee for the major achievements made in the printing technology innovation movement over the past year, and we must continue to adhere to this policy in the future. We must use both indigenous and foreign methods. If the conditions for using "foreign methods" are insufficient, we should first use "indigenous methods." We must solve both cutting-edge problems and general problems in current production; only in this way can we rapidly improve the printing level of small and medium-sized printing factories.
    In order to complete the task of printing technology innovation, we must resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, rely on the broad masses of workers, and implement putting politics in command. This is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all our work. We should be full of confidence, go all out, strive for the top, and achieve greater victories in the new year.
    China is the country that invented printing technology the earliest in the world. We must have lofty ambitions and strive to make China's printing industry and printing technology catch up with the world's advanced level in the shortest possible time, so as to realize the demands of the Party and the people on the printing industry.

    进一步提高印刷技术
    为了适应技术革命和文化革命的需要，更有效地为工业、农业和文化教育事业的大跃进服务，自去年以来，全国的报纸书刊印刷工作者，在党和政府的领导下，在有关方面的大力协作和支持下，积极展开了发展印刷生产力的工作，要在今后几年内建立一个从中央到县的、大中小并举的、土洋结合的全国报纸书刊印刷网。这一工作已经取得了很大成就。在积极发展印刷网的同时，广泛开展了提高印刷质量、加快报纸书刊印刷速度、实现机械化半机械化，改进生产工艺、提高操作技术为主要内容的印刷技术革新运动。由于紧紧地依靠了党的领导，实行了政治挂帅，贯彻了“两条腿走路”的方针，在印刷技术革新运动中取得了很大成绩。出版物的印刷生产周期和出报时间缩短了很多，出版物的印刷质量普遍提高，各地发明创造了整套的、土洋结合的排字和装订机械，出现了几千项改进工艺和操作的先进经验，其中不少对提高印刷生产的技术水平，具有重要的意义，同时，也促进了印刷工业机械化和半机械化。印刷技术的革新，虽然有了很好的开端，但是，我国的现代印刷技术，在很多方面仍然是比较落后的。许多印刷技术上的带有重大关键性质的尖端问题，还需要进一步研究解决。因此，我们要争取在短时期内，使印刷技术的水平有更大的提高。
    加强印刷技术革新和推广先进经验的规划工作，是今后印刷技术革新运动中十分重要的事情。有了规划就可以抓住方向，明确目标，有计划有领导地安排任务，使用力量，组织协作。当前印刷技术革新的主要方向是：逐步实现排字和装订生产的机械化、半机械化和自动化；大力提高铅印质量；发扬和革新祖国的传统印刷技术；进一步提高彩印技术。排字和装订的机械化，是印刷生产效率迅速提高的关键，必须努力促其实现。铅印出版物，在我国的出版物中占有很大的比重，可是铅印印刷质量在目前是一个薄弱环节，现在各地用的字模规格不一，字形也不统一，今后应该逐步加以规范化。木刻水印是我国富有民族风格的传统印刷术，是目前复制水墨画最完美的印刷方法，今后还需进一步改进操作，提高质量，继续试制新产品。
    坚持“两条腿走路”的方针，是一年多来印刷技术革新运动中，取得重大成绩的重要保证，今后仍然必须坚持这个方针。我们必须土洋并举，用“洋法”的条件不足，就先用“土法”上马。既要解决尖端问题，也要解决当前生产中的一般问题；这样才能迅速提高中小印刷厂的印刷水平。
    为了完成印刷技术革新的任务，必须坚决地依靠党的领导，依靠广大职工群众，实行政治挂帅。这是我们一切工作胜利的根本保证。我们应当满怀信心、鼓足干劲、力争上游，在新的一年里取得更大的胜利。
    中国是世界上最早发明印刷技术的国家，我们一定要有雄心壮志，在最短期间内，使我国的印刷工业和印刷技术，赶上世界先进水平，以实现党和人民对印刷工业的要求。
