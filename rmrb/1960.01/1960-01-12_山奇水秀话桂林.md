Talking About Guilin's Unique Scenery
    Shigong

    "Guilin's scenery is the best in the world" is a long-standing saying. In fact, the scenery in other parts of our country is also very beautiful, but Guilin's scenery is not only beautiful but also unique, giving people a refreshing feeling after seeing the usual scenery. This may be an important reason why people think it can be called "the best in the world."

    What is so unique about Guilin's scenery? People like to use the four words "unique mountains and beautiful waters" to describe it, and this is absolutely true. Look at the strange rocks standing like forests, with solitary peaks rising abruptly. These strange rocks are like forests or ramparts, with various shapes. Liu Zongyuan once marveled at them and made such a wonderful description: "The rocks that protrude, lean, and emerge from the soil, vying for strange shapes, are almost uncountable. Those that are piled up precariously, resembling cattle and horses drinking in the stream. Those that jut upwards in rows, resembling bears climbing the mountain." Those solitary peaks are even more miraculous. You can imagine them as vigorous old men, graceful young girls, ferocious lions and tigers, or agile hunting dogs. You can also see them as scholars' brush holders, or warriors' weapons....

    What is particularly amazing is that these mountains and rocks often rise from the flat ground, abruptly appearing amidst fields, and even suddenly appearing in busy city streets, just as the Qing Dynasty poet Yuan Zicai wrote: "No trace of mountain ranges to be seen, suddenly a peak pierces the Southern Dipper." Such unique mountains are indeed rare elsewhere.

    Look again at the clear river water, as bright and clean as a mirror, reflecting the sky and mountains in fine detail. Occasionally, the wind blows, and the waves ripple, making the reflections in the water appear broken and reunited, sometimes visible and sometimes hidden, elusive and fascinating. Where else can you find such beautiful water?

    Guilin's scenery is so unique, and it has its reasons. This is thanks to the workers of nature, and the trickling water is the sculptor of the unique mountains. But there is also running water elsewhere, so why is it not "unique mountains and beautiful waters"? This is because the surface layer of the earth's crust in Guangxi is mostly composed of limestone. Limestone is different from many rocks in that it is particularly easily dissolved by water containing carbon dioxide. Dissolution is the main way it is destroyed, so after being destroyed, it does not form a large amount of sediment that makes the water turbid, but rather dissolves in the water to keep the water clear. The process of destruction is also unlike many other rocks that peel off layer by layer from the surface to the inside. Instead, the water destroys wherever it reaches. Water flows downwards and drills into crevices. It drills into the cracks of the limestone and dissolves it into cavities, which gradually expand. If these cracks are vertical, the cavities will become funnel-shaped. When the funnels continue to expand until they are connected to each other, only some isolated residual pillars remain between them, which are the unique peaks and rocks we see. If the cracks go deep underground in a winding manner, the result of dissolution creates complex caves. These caves can also gradually develop until they are connected to each other, and when they store water, they become true underground rivers and lakes. If the rivers on the ground are connected to such caves, they will be swallowed up and suddenly disappear on the surface. There are also many stalactites formed in the caves, and their shapes are also strange and varied, decorating the caves into a magical world. These underground scenes make Guilin's scenery even more attractive.

    After the water seeps into the ground, its ability to dissolve limestone is very strong, because the underground pressure is high, which can dissolve more carbon dioxide in the water. Thus, the underground caves can gradually expand until the top wall cannot support itself and collapses. Sometimes a section of the cave roof can be preserved after the collapse, looking like a bridge. Obviously, construction in this area needs to be careful, so as not to let heavy buildings press on a dangerous cave roof. However, caves do not only bring us threats. Many caves exposed on the ground were once human dwellings, so Guangxi is the best place to find human fossils. Caves are also a source of drought resistance, and there may be oil storage in the underground cavities, so Guangxi is also a very promising oil-producing area. As for the many limestones, they have a wide range of uses in metallurgy, chemical industry, construction and other aspects. The mountains and rivers of the motherland are not only pleasing to the eye, but also have their own economic value.

    山奇水秀话桂林
    石工
    “桂林山水甲天下”，知名已久，其实我国别处的山水也都很美，但桂林山水不仅很美而且别具风格，使人在看惯了通常的山水之后，得到一种清新的感受，这也许是人们认为它可以“甲天下”的一个重要原因。
    桂林山水别具什么风格呢？人们爱用“山奇水秀”四字来形容它，这真是一点不假。你看那怪石林立，孤峰突起；这些怪石若林若嶂，形态万千，柳宗元曾为之惊叹，作了这样精彩的描述：“其石之突怒偃蹇、负土而出、争为奇状者、殆不可数。其嵚然相累而下者、若牛马之饮于溪。其冲然角列而上者、若熊羆之登于山。”那座座孤峰更是鬼斧神工，你也可以把它们想像为苍劲的老人、婀娜的少女、凶猛的狮虎、矫健的猎犬，也可以看作是文人的笔架、武士的兵刃……。
    尤为奇绝的是这些山石常常是平地青云，突兀田野之间，甚至在通衢闹市中突然出现，正像清朝诗人袁子才所写的：“来龙去脉绝无有，突然一峰插南斗。”这样的奇山，确是别处少有。
    你再看那清澈的江水，明净如镜，天光山色，纤细毕呈，间或风吹浪起船漾清波，更使水中倒影若碎若合、若隐若现，扑朔迷离，引人入胜。这样的秀水，别处又哪能见到。
    桂林山水如此奇绝，自有它的来由，这多亏了大自然的工人，那涓涓的流水就是奇山的雕琢者。但是别处也有流水，为何不是山奇水秀？这因为广西一带的地壳表层大部分是石灰岩构成，石灰岩和许多岩石不同，它特别容易被溶有碳酸气的水溶解。溶解是它受到破坏的主要方式，因而破坏以后不会形成大量泥沙使流水浑浊，而是溶化在水中使水保持清亮；破坏的过程也不像其他许多岩石那样由表及里地层层剥落，而是水到之处就受破坏。水性向下，有缝就钻，钻到石灰岩的裂缝里，将它溶成空洞，逐渐扩大。如果这些裂缝是直立的，空洞就会成为一个个漏斗似的形状，当漏斗不断扩大以致相互连通时，在它们之间便只剩下些孤立的残柱，这就是我们看见的奇峰怪石。如果裂缝是曲折地深入地下，溶解的结果就造了复杂的洞穴，这些洞穴也可以逐渐发展以致彼此相连，里面贮藏水的时候便成了真正的地下河湖。而地上的河流如果与这种洞穴相通，便会被它吞没，突然在地面失踪。洞穴中还有许多石钟乳形成，它们的形状又是千奇百怪，把洞穴点缀成一个神奇的世界，这些地下景色，使桂林山水更加引人入胜。
    水渗入到地下以后，对石灰岩的溶解力是很大的，因为地下的压力大，能够使更多的碳酸气溶解在水中，于是地下的洞穴可以逐渐扩大到顶壁不能支持，发生塌陷，塌陷后有时还能保存一段洞顶，看起来就像桥梁一般。显然，在这种区域进行建筑需要当心，不要使沉重的建筑物正好压上一个危险的洞顶。但是洞穴并不只是给我们带来威胁，许多露出地面的山洞曾经是人类的故居，因此广西是找寻人类化石最好的场所。洞穴还是抗旱的水源，而地下的空洞中也可能有石油贮存，因此广西又是极有希望的石油产地。至于那许多石灰岩更在冶金、化工、建筑等方面有着广泛的用途，祖国的山水不仅中看，而且有自己的经济价值。
