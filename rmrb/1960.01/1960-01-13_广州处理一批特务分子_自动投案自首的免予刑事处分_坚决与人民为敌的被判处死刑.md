Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th. The Guangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate and Intermediate People's Court recently handled a batch of special agents dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, based on the policy of leniency for confession and severity for resistance. Three special agents who voluntarily surrendered were declared exempt from criminal punishment; two special agents who resolutely antagonized the people were sentenced to death and executed immediately; and another special agent was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, to be subjected to labor reform to see how he would behave.

The special agent Jian Hao, who was declared exempt from criminal punishment, joined the Chiang gang's "Central Committee" special agent organization in Hong Kong in 1958 and received special agent training in demolition and secret writing. At the end of 1959, the special agent agency sent him and his wife, the special agent Lin Jianwen, to Guangzhou, ordering them to blow up the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall and carry out assassination activities during the New Year's Day period. Jian Hao, deterred by the high vigilance of the people and the powerful force of the public security organs in the mainland, and especially after reading the amnesty order of the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, underwent ideological changes. Therefore, after receiving the mission from the special agent organization, he decided to abandon darkness and seek the light, and to turn over a new leaf. On the morning of December 30th last year, when Jian Hao and Lin Jianwen arrived at Gongbei from Hong Kong via Macau, they surrendered to the public security organs and handed over the explosives and secret writing drugs on the spot.

Another "Central Committee" special agent, Kuang Hua, who voluntarily surrendered and was declared exempt from criminal punishment, joined the special agent organization in Hong Kong in 1958. Not long ago, he heard that some special agents had been treated leniently by the government after surrendering and confessing. After repeated ideological struggles, he finally chose a correct path, surrendered to the people's public security organs, and exposed a lurking special agent.

The Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate People's Court recently sentenced the special agents Zhou Jinbiao and Fan Caining to death. With the approval of the Supreme People's Court, they have been executed by shooting. Zhou Jinbiao, a "Bureau of Intelligence" special agent, participated in special agent organizations in Hong Kong twice and received special agent training in demolition, etc. After Zhou Jinbiao sneaked into Guangzhou in July last year, he actively observed the terrain, determined demolition targets, and received three packs of American-made high explosives and three detonators from the Hong Kong special agent agency, preparing to carry out demolition. When he was carrying out these conspiratorial activities, he was discovered and arrested by the public security organs. The special agent Fan Caining joined the Chiang gang's "Central Committee" special agent organization in Hong Kong last year and received special agent training. In August last year, the Chiang gang's special agent agency appointed him as the "Station Chief of the Intelligence Station" in Wuzhou, Guangxi, attempting to sneak into Guangzhou and then transfer to Wuzhou, plotting to set fire to the warehouses, docks, etc. in Wuzhou City when the people of Wuzhou were celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. This special agent was discovered by the masses and captured by the public security organs before he carried out his criminal activities.

The special agent Deng Jing, who was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve and subjected to labor reform to see how he would behave, joined the Chiang gang's "Bureau of Intelligence" special agent organization in Hong Kong in May 1958. In June last year, the special agent agency taught him demolition techniques and sent him to Guangzhou to plot demolition activities. After Deng Jing arrived in Guangzhou, the workers and staff discovered his suspicious situation and promptly reported it to the public security organs. After investigation and verification, he was arrested and brought to justice according to law.

    广州处理一批特务分子
    自动投案自首的免予刑事处分
    坚决与人民为敌的被判处死刑
    新华社广州12日电　广州市人民检察院和中级人民法院，最近根据坦白从宽、抗拒从严的政策，处理了一批蒋介石集团派遣的特务分子。有三名特务分子自动投案，被宣布免予刑事处分；两名特务分子坚决与人民为敌，被判处死刑立即执行；另一名特务分子被判处死刑，缓期二年执行，劳动改造，以观后效。
    被宣布免予刑事处分的特务分子简浩，1958年在香港参加蒋帮“中委会”特务组织，接受了爆破和密写等特务训练。1959年年底，特务机关派他和他的妻子、特务分子林健文潜来广州，要他们在元旦期间爆炸中山纪念堂和进行暗害活动。简浩慑于内地人民群众的高度警惕性和公安机关的强大威力，特别是当他读过中华人民共和国主席特赦令以后，思想上发生了动摇。因此当他接到特务组织的任务以后，便决定弃暗投明，改过自新。去年12月30日上午，简浩和林健文从香港经澳门到拱北的时候，即向公安机关投案自首，并当场交出爆炸器材和密写药。
    另一名投案自首被宣布免予刑事处分的“中委会”特务分子邝华，于1958年在香港参加特务组织。不久以前，他听说有些特务分子在投案自首后得到政府宽大处理，经过反复思想斗争以后，终于选择了一条正确的道路，向人民公安机关投案，并检举了潜伏的特务分子。
    广州市中级人民法院最近判处特务分子周锦标、范采凝死刑，经最高人民法院批准，已经执行枪决。“情报局”特务周锦标在香港先后两次参加特务组织，接受了爆破等特务训练。去年7月，周锦标潜来广州后，积极观察地形，确定爆破目标，并从香港特务机关领取了美制烈性炸药三包、雷管三支，准备进行爆破。当他正在进行这些阴谋活动的时候，就被公安机关发现并逮捕了。特务分子范采凝，去年在香港参加蒋帮
  “中委会”特务组织，受过特务训练。去年8月，蒋帮特务机关委任他为广西梧州“情报站站长”，企图在潜入广州后转往梧州，阴谋在梧州人民庆祝建国十周年的时候纵火焚烧梧州市的仓库、码头等。这个特务分子在他进行犯罪活动之前，就被群众发现，被公安机关捕获了。
    被判处死刑、缓期二年，劳动改造以观后效的特务分子邓景，1958年5月在香港参加蒋帮“情报局”特务组织。去年6月，特务机关教给他爆破技术，并派他潜来广州，阴谋进行爆破活动。邓景到广州以后，职工群众发现了他的可疑情况，及时向公安机关报告，经侦察证实，依法将他逮捕归案。
