Good News on Accelerating Agricultural Technological Transformation

Guangxi Produces Paddy Field Tractor
Sealed Braking Components Allow it to Travel in Muddy Water; Ingenious Construction Allows Cultivation in Hilly Areas

(Our newspaper, Liuzhou, 25th) A type of tractor suitable for paddy field cultivation in the South – the "Honghe" brand tractor – has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Liuzhou Machinery Factory in Guangxi and has begun small-scale production.

The factory recently held a victory celebration meeting. Qin Yingji, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region, personally cut the ribbon and spoke at the meeting.

This 35-horsepower "Honghe" brand 35-type diesel tractor was designed and manufactured based on the characteristics of the South, which has many paddy fields, hills, terraced fields, smaller plots of land, and high temperatures. After careful appraisal by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Agricultural Machinery Research Institute and the Liuzhou Machinery Factory, and repeated tests in dry and paddy fields, it has been proven to have good specifications and quality, and has met the prescribed technical standards.

The "Honghe" brand tractor has many structural advantages. Light weight, small size, and high efficiency are the first characteristics of the "Honghe" brand tractor. The entire machine, including oil and water, weighs a total of 1,492 kilograms, which is half the weight of similar tractors. According to actual operation, its horsepower exceeds the design horsepower, and it can move lightly in the muddy conditions of paddy fields. Its efficiency is 40 to 70 mu of land cultivated every ten hours; it can deeply cultivate more than eight inches in paddy fields and six to eight inches in dry land, and 96% of the land per mu can be cultivated, and the tillage is loose and even. The second characteristic is that the braking components are completely sealed. 148 braking mechanisms, such as the motor, are sealed with oil-resistant, waterproof, and dustproof glue, so that they can adapt to the conditions of paddy field cultivation. The third characteristic is that it is easy to start and runs flexibly. It can turn around in a space of two zhang square, and can cultivate arbitrarily in paddy fields with an area of only eight fen of land when equipped with a three-furrow plow. In addition, the rear of the tractor is equipped with hydraulic lifting equipment, and the tractor operator can directly adjust the depth of the rear plow and harrow from the driving platform, saving the agricultural implement operator who specializes in operating agricultural implements on ordinary tractors. Wide application is also a characteristic of the "Honghe" brand tractor. Because this tractor is equipped with a power output shaft, in addition to field operations, it can also drive a 20-kilowatt generator to generate electricity for rural lighting or threshing, rice milling, and pumping water for irrigation; this tractor can also be used as a means of transportation, capable of towing three tons and traveling at 22 or 23 kilometers per hour. It is an all-purpose tractor.

The Liuzhou Machinery Factory accepted the task of trial-producing this tractor from the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery and the Autonomous Region Party Committee at the end of October last year. The responsible comrades of the factory's Party committee went deep into the front line of production and joined the masses in the upsurge of fighting for the production of tractors. They prepared day and night operation plans and schedules according to parts and components and major quotas, and carried out strict inspections every day, and solved problems in a timely manner. The entire factory launched a mass technological innovation movement and carried out heated competitions, performance competitions, and "one-dragon" competitions. In the process of manufacturing the tractor, the employees put forward 2,748 rationalization proposals, of which 279 were major technological innovations. Of the more than 2,200 parts on the tractor, except for the tires, rubber parts, water tank and other collaborative parts, the rest were trial-produced by the factory itself. In the trial production process, the factory adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to manufacture more than 1,100 sets of special tools and special equipment such as "building block" molds and presses, multi-head drilling machines, etc., which not only ensured that the trial production task was completed within 57 days, but also created favorable conditions for batch production.

While actively speeding up the trial production progress, the Liuzhou Machinery Factory has always followed the "meticulous" instructions put forward by the District Party Committee, and paid close attention to quality, without letting go of even a single screw. The raw materials used in the trial production were strictly selected and chemically analyzed, and every carefully manufactured part was carefully checked for size and finish using various precision measuring tools. The inside and outside of many main parts were also inspected with advanced and sensitive instruments such as magnetic flaw detectors and ultrasonic flaw detectors. The first batch of five "iron oxen" all achieved "strong bones and normal internal organs".

Guangxi-made "Honghe" brand tractors operate freely in paddy fields.

### 加速农业技术改造的喜讯  广西制成水田拖拉机  制动部件密封　能在泥水中驰骋　构造灵巧　可在丘陵地带耕作

    加速农业技术改造的喜讯
    广西制成水田拖拉机
    制动部件密封　能在泥水中驰骋　构造灵巧　可在丘陵地带耕作
    本报柳州25日电　一种适合南方水田耕作条件的拖拉机——“红河”牌拖拉机，最近在广西柳州机械厂试制成功，并开始小批生产。
    这个厂最近举行了祝捷大会。中共广西僮族自治区委员会书记处书记、自治区副主席覃应机亲临剪彩，并在大会上讲了话。
    这种三十五马力的“红河”牌三五型柴油拖拉机，是根据南方多水田、而且丘陵、梯田较多，田块较小和气温高等特点设计制造的。经过广西僮族自治区农业机械研究所和柳州机械厂的仔细鉴定，并在旱地和水田里反复试验，证明规格质量良好，达到了规定的技术标准。
    “红河”牌拖拉机的结构具有许多优点。重量轻，体积小，功效大，是“红河”牌拖拉机的第一个特点。全机连油带水在内共重一千四百九十二公斤，比同类的拖拉机要轻一半。据实际操作证明，它的马力超过了设计马力，能够在水田的烂泥里轻装前进。它的功效，每十小时耕田四十到七十亩；在水田里深耕八寸以上，旱地深耕六到八寸，每亩田的96％的土地都能耕到，而且耕得松匀。第二个特点是制动部件完全密封。马达等一百四十八种制动机构，都用耐油、防水、防尘的胶封口，这样就能适应水田耕作的条件。第三个特点是起动方便，运转灵活。在两丈见方的地方就可以转弯，挂上三铧犁可以在面积只有八分地的水田里任意耕作。另外，拖拉机的尾部装有液压升降设备，拖拉机手在驾驶台上可以直接调整后面犁耙耕作的深浅，把一般拖拉机上专门操纵农具的农具手省下来了。用途广，也是“红河”牌拖拉机的一个特点。这种拖拉机因为装有动力输出轴，除担负田间作业外，还可以带动容量二十瓩的发电机发电，供农村照明或打谷、碾米、抽水灌田；这种拖拉机还可以作运输工具，能牵引三吨，每小时走二十二、三公里。它是一种万能拖拉机。
    柳州机械厂在去年10月底接受了农业机械部和自治区党委关于试制这种拖拉机的任务。工厂党委负责同志深入生产第一线，同群众一起投入为生产拖拉机而战的热潮。他们按照部件零件和主要定额，编制昼夜作业计划和进度表，每天进行严格的检查，发现问题及时解决。全厂大搞群众性的技术革新运动，开展了热烈的对手赛、表演赛、“一条龙”赛。在制造拖拉机的过程中，职工们提出了两千七百四十八条合理化建议，重大的技术革新有二百七十九项。拖拉机上的两千二百多种零件，除了轮胎、橡胶件水箱等协作件以外，其余都是这个厂自己试制的。在试制过程中，这个厂采取土洋结合的办法，制造了“积木式”压模和压床、多头钻床等专用工具和专用设备一千一百多套，不仅保证了在五十七天内就完成试制任务，而且为成批生产创造了有利条件。
    柳州机械厂在积极加快试制进度的同时，始终遵循着区党委提出的“一丝不苟”的指示，把紧质量关，连一颗螺丝钉也不放过。试制中所用的原材料，都进行了严格的挑选和化验分析，精心制造出的每一个零件，都用各种精密的量具仔细检查了尺寸和光洁度，许多主要零件的内部和外部，还用磁力探伤器和超音波探伤仪等高级锐敏的仪器作了检验。第一批生产出的五部“铁牛”都作到了“筋骨健壮，五脏正常”。广西制成的“红河”牌拖拉机在水田里运转自如
