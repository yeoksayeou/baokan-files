In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, China's petroleum industry has developed rapidly. In 1958, China's crude oil production increased by 55% compared to 1957; and the production in 1959 had an even greater increase than in 1958. After two years of the Great Leap Forward, a brand new situation has emerged on the petroleum industry front. On the one hand, focusing on natural petroleum, with both natural and synthetic petroleum developing side by side, large-scale modern petroleum industrial enterprises are being built; on the other hand, using the method of "first indigenous, then foreign" and combining indigenous and foreign methods, small and medium-sized synthetic petroleum plants are being vigorously developed. At present, twenty-eight provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country have established small and medium-sized synthetic petroleum plants mainly based on the comprehensive utilization of coal. This is a major victory for the Party's General Line and the "walking on two legs" policy on the petroleum industry front.

The development speed of China's petroleum industry is astonishing. However, judging from the needs, the development of the petroleum industry is far from fully meeting the requirements of industrial and agricultural production and other aspects. The higher the degree of national industrialization, the greater the need for petroleum. In 1960, the petroleum industry must further meet the greater and higher demands put forward in the continued leap forward of the national economy. Especially in the case of accelerating the implementation of agricultural modernization, this requirement is even more urgent. Therefore, producing more petroleum products at a faster rate to support the overall leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has become an urgent task for the current petroleum industry.

To ensure the rapid development of the petroleum industry, it is necessary to continue to implement the Party's policy of walking on two legs. On the one hand, we must vigorously develop and actively run large-scale modern petroleum enterprises. These enterprises have new technologies, large output, many varieties, and high quality, and are the backbone of the petroleum industry. However, building a large petroleum enterprise requires more steel, more complex equipment, larger investments, and longer construction time. In order to be able to meet the needs of petroleum in the development of the national economy in a relatively short period of time, relying only on the development of large-scale petroleum enterprises, and only using the "large foreign groups" (大洋群) approach, walking on only one leg, would be limited in terms of both construction speed and quantity. Therefore, on the other hand, it is necessary to fully mobilize the positive factors of all parties, make full use of various decentralized resources, vigorously develop petroleum "small foreign groups" (小洋群) and "small indigenous groups" (小土群) enterprises, and continue to vigorously develop small and medium-sized synthetic petroleum plants mainly based on the comprehensive utilization of coal, in order to more rapidly increase petroleum production.

Small and medium-sized, indigenous-foreign combined synthetic petroleum enterprises have many advantages in China's specific conditions. First of all, small and medium-sized enterprises can make full use of various decentralized and scattered resources for comprehensive utilization. According to existing experience, in addition to coal and oil shale, resources available for refining synthetic oil include peat, pine roots, pine branches, birch bark, and oil tea seed cake. Moreover, coal slurry and water slag after washing coking coal can also be used for oil refining. Such decentralized and scattered resources, but in large quantities when put together, can only be fully utilized by using decentralized and small-scale methods. Secondly, small synthetic oil plants require very little equipment, steel, and investment, and construction time is also very short. Taking the construction of a synthetic petroleum plant with an annual output of 300 tons of crude oil as an example, the investment is only 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, the steel required is only three to four tons, and the equipment only requires an exhaust fan, two water pumps, and 18 horsepower of power. These equipment can be manufactured by local machinery factories. The construction time is only about one month. If the construction scale is smaller, it can basically be without steel and mechanical power, and wooden blowers can also be used for production. Third, the products of small synthetic oil plants can meet the needs of tractors and irrigation and drainage machinery for agriculture. If the recently successfully tested regenerative cracking furnace is used, a portion of gasoline can also be produced for automobiles. According to needs, crude phenol, asphalt, petroleum coke, industrial lubricating oil, paraffin and other products can also be produced, and there are many by-products, such as: semi-coke, gas, and wastewater, that can be utilized. A synthetic petroleum plant is simply like a "treasure chest." Taking a small factory with an annual output of 300 tons of crude oil using coal as raw material as an example, using simple distillation processing methods, after refining, it can produce more than 100 tons of light diesel oil annually, enough for 17 or 18 tractors or 260 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery to use for a year; if a regenerative cracking furnace is added (basically without steel, only a small exhaust fan is needed), the products and output will be greater, approximately producing more than 200 tons of gasoline, kerosene, light diesel, and heavy diesel. In addition to liquid fuels, it can also produce about 20 tons of cresol, which can be used to make about 40 tons of phenolic resin, and produce more than 20 tons of ammonium sulfate. These ammonium sulfate are used for fertilizing fields, which can increase grain production by about 200,000 catties. This small petroleum plant can also produce more than 15,000 cubic meters of gas per day, which can drive gas engines, burn brick kilns, and also be piped to public canteens for fuel. The semi-coke produced by this plant can be used for iron smelting in blast furnaces below 28 cubic meters, or as a gasification raw material for small nitrogen fertilizer plants, or as fuel. The wastewater from oil refining in this plant can also be used for fertilizing fields and killing insects. If necessary, as long as the processing process is changed, it can also produce lubricating oil, paraffin, and asphalt. Fourth, because the production process and equipment are relatively simple, the production operation technology can be mastered with just a little training in three or four months. Fifth, small plants are built dispersedly, they can be produced and used locally, reducing transportation difficulties. If each county has several or even more than a dozen such small plants, it can greatly promote the mechanization of agriculture, and also facilitate the production of fertilizer plants and iron smelting plants, and the development of phenolic plastic enterprises. From this point of view, developing small and medium-sized synthetic petroleum plants is an important link in the development of local industry.

Since the benefits of vigorously developing petroleum industry "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" are so many, can all regions set them up? It is entirely possible. The vast majority of counties and most people's communes in China have the resource conditions for running oil production. According to preliminary investigations, there are currently more than 1,700 counties in China with coal resources, and 146 counties with oil shale, plus peat, pine roots, pine branches, birch bark, oil tea seed cake, coal slurry and water slag from coal washing, etc., the resources are quite extensive and rich. Small and medium-sized synthetic oil plants can be run not only by counties, cities, agencies, enterprises, and schools in places with resource conditions, but also by people's communes. Among the more than 400 small and medium-sized petroleum plants that are currently in normal production, many of them were established by people's communes. After more than a year of production practice, we have accumulated relatively rich experience in production technology, business management, and basic construction, which is also an important condition. At the same time, in order to support the development of small and medium-sized synthetic oil plants, the state has also made appropriate arrangements and considerations in terms of equipment manufacturing and steel supply this year. There are many favorable conditions. As long as we exert full effort, follow the mass line, the local small and medium-sized synthetic petroleum industry will definitely achieve greater development.

Local petroleum industry is an important force on the petroleum industry front. However, vigorously developing local petroleum industry is still a new thing for us after all. To do this well, strengthening the Party organization's leadership over this work and making development plans are particularly important. Here, it is required that all regions incorporate the production and construction of local petroleum industry into the industrial plan, as an important part of local industry, and mobilize coal, machinery and other industrial departments, commercial departments, and schools and scientific research institutions to provide active support in terms of resources, material conditions, and technology. To enable small and medium-sized petroleum enterprises to quickly exert their effectiveness, it is necessary to concentrate efforts to ensure that the newly built small and medium-sized petroleum plants this year are completed as soon as possible, and quickly form the backbone of the local petroleum industry, laying a more solid foundation for the local petroleum industry. In addition to these "medium foreign groups" and "small foreign groups" petroleum enterprises, all regions should also pay close attention to the development of small factories with an annual output of less than 100 tons that can basically do without steel and mechanical power. Although the output of this small factory is not high, it has a wider mass nature and adaptability. From small to large, from indigenous to foreign, is still an important way to develop the local petroleum industry. We have initially built a batch of small and medium-sized petroleum plants. The current problem is to fully exert the equipment capacity of these factories. The crude oil production capacity of the existing small and medium-sized petroleum plants in the country is about 400,000 tons, which is the most reliable guarantee for completing this year's local crude oil production task. In terms of equipment and material usage, priority should be given to those enterprises that have already been built, and it is necessary to ensure the supply of complete sets of equipment to enable them to quickly produce normally. In existing enterprises, it is necessary to boldly mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, realize semi-mechanization and mechanization of production operations, improve the oil recovery rate of oil extraction and processing, improve quality, reduce costs, and increase the production of more and better petroleum products. Finally, all regions must also vigorously grasp the organizational leadership of indigenous method coking for oil recovery, and universally achieve "coking must recover oil."

To develop the petroleum industry at a high speed, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out mass movements, resolutely implement the Party's "walking on two legs" policy, and while vigorously developing modern, large-scale petroleum enterprises, vigorously develop petroleum "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups," so that the development speed of China's petroleum industry will be greatly accelerated, thereby adapting to the ever-increasing needs of various departments of the national economy for petroleum.

    大办中小型石油工厂
    几年来，特别是大跃进以来，我国石油工业有了飞跃的发展。1958年，我国原油产量比1957年增长了55％；1959年的产量又比1958年有更大的增长。经过两年的大跃进，石油工业战线已经出现了一个崭新的局面。一方面以天然石油为主，天然石油和人造石油并举，进行了大规模的现代化大型石油工业企业的建设；另一方面，用先土后洋、土洋结合的办法，大搞中、小型人造石油厂。目前，全国二十八个省、市和自治区已经兴办了以煤炭综合利用为主的中、小型人造石油工厂，这是党的总路线和“两条腿走路”的方针在石油工业战线上的重大胜利。
    我国石油工业的发展速度是惊人的。但是，从需要来看，石油工业的发展还远不能充分满足工农业生产和其他方面的要求。国家工业化的程度越高，对石油的需要量就越大。1960年，石油工业必须进一步满足国民经济继续跃进中提出的更多更高的要求。特别是在加速推行农业现代化的情况下，这种要求就更加迫切。因此，用更快的速度，生产更多的石油产品，支援工农业生产全面跃进，就成为当前石油工业的迫切任务。
    保证石油工业的迅速发展，必需继续贯彻党的两条腿走路的方针。一方面要大力发展和积极办好大型的现代化的石油企业。这些企业的技术新、产量大、品种多、质量高，是石油工业的骨干。但是，建设一座大型石油企业，需要用较多的钢材，较复杂的设备，较大的投资和较长的建设时间。我们要在较短的期间内，做到能够适应国民经济发展中对石油的需要，只靠发展大型石油企业的作法，只用“大洋群”这一条腿走路，无论在建设速度和数量上都会受到一定的限制。因此，另一方面要充分调动各方面的积极因素，充分利用各种分散的资源，大搞石油“小洋群”和“小土群”企业，继续用土洋结合的办法，大力发展以煤炭综合利用为主体的中、小型人造石油厂，以便更迅速地增加石油的产量。
    中、小型的土洋结合的人造石油企业，在我国的具体条件下，是有很多优越性的。首先，中、小型企业可以充分利用各种分散的、零星资源进行综合利用。根据现有的经验，可供炼人造油的资源除了煤炭与油母页岩外，还有草炭、松根、松枝、桦树皮、油茶枯等，而且还可以用炼焦煤洗选后的煤泥与水渣炼油。这种分散零星的、但是集中起来数量又是很大的资源，只有用分散的小型的办法，才能充分利用。其次，小型人造油厂所需的设备、钢材、投资都很少，建设时间也很短。以建设年产三百吨原油的人造石油厂为例，投资只要两、三万元，钢材只要三、四吨，设备只要一个排风机、两台水泵和十八马力的动力。这些设备，地方机械工厂都能制造。建设时间只要一个月左右。如果建设规模更小一点的厂，就可基本不用钢材，也可以不用机械动力，用木制鼓风机也能生产。第三，小型人造油厂的产品，可以适合农业用的拖拉机和排灌机械的需要。如果采用最近试验成功的蓄热式裂化炉，还可以生产一部分汽油供汽车使用，根据需要也可以生产粗酚、沥青、石油焦、工业用润滑油、石腊等产品，并且还有许多副产品，如：半焦、煤气、废水等可供利用。一座人造石油厂简直像一个“百宝箱”。以年产三百吨原油的、用煤为原料的小型厂为例，用简单蒸馏加工方法，经过精制后，它可以年产一百吨以上的轻柴油，足够十七、八台拖拉机或二百六十马力排灌机械使用一年；如再加一个蓄热式的裂化炉（基本不用钢材，只需一个小排风机），产品和产量就更多，大约可产汽油、煤油、轻柴油、重柴油等二百吨以上。除了液体燃料以外，还可产甲酚二十吨左右，可制酚醛树脂四十吨左右，可产硫铵二十余吨。这些硫铵用于肥田，可增产粮食二十万斤左右。这个小型石油厂每天还可生产煤气一万五千多立方米，可以开动煤气机，可以烧砖瓦窑，也可以通到公共食堂作燃料。这个厂生产的半焦可供二十八立方米以下的高炉炼铁之用，或作为小氮肥厂的造气原料，也可作为燃料。这个厂炼油的废水也可以用来肥田和杀虫。如有需要，只要把加工过程改变一下，还能生产润滑油、石腊和沥青。第四，因为生产过程与设备比较简单，生产操作的技术，只要稍加训练，有三、四个月时间就可掌握。第五，小型厂分散建设，可以就地生产，就地使用，减少运输的困难。每个县有这样的几座以至十多座小厂，就可大大推动农业机械化的进行，还可便利化肥厂、炼铁厂的生产，和发展酚醛塑料企业。由此看来，发展中、小型人造石油工厂，是地方工业发展中的一个重要环节。
    大搞石油工业“小洋群”和“小土群”的好处既然如此之多，那么各地是否都可以兴办呢？完全可能。我国绝大多数县份和大部分人民公社都具备了办油的资源条件。据初步查明，目前我国有一千七百多个县有煤炭资源，有一百四十六个县有油母页岩，再加草炭、松根、松枝、桦树皮、油茶枯、洗煤的煤泥和水渣等，资源是相当广泛而丰富的。中、小型人造油厂，不只有资源条件的地方的县、市、机关、企业、学校可以办，而且人民公社也能办。目前做到正常生产的四百多中、小型石油厂，其中有许多厂就是人民公社兴办的。经过一年多的生产实践，我们已经积累了比较丰富的生产技术、经营管理和基本建设的经验，这也是一个重要条件。同时，国家为了扶持中小型人造油厂的发展，今年在设备制造与钢材供应上，也做了适当的安排和照顾。有利条件是很多的，只要我们鼓足干劲，走群众路线，地方中、小型人造石油工业，一定能够获得更大的发展。
    地方石油工业是石油工业战线上一支重要的力量。但是，大办地方石油工业，对我们来说，毕竟还是一件新事情。要把这件事办好，加强党组织对这项工作的领导，做好发展规划，就显得特别重要了。这里，要求各地把地方石油工业的生产建设纳入工业计划中去，作为地方工业的一个重要组成部分，并发动煤炭、机械等工业部门、商业部门和学校、科学研究机构，从资源、物资条件和技术上给予积极支持。要使中小型石油企业迅速发挥效能，就要集中力量，保证今年新建的中、小型石油厂星日建成，迅速形成地方石油工业的骨干，为地方石油工业打下更坚实的基础。除了这些“中洋群”和“小洋群”的石油企业以外，各地还要十分注意发展可以基本不用钢材和机械动力的、年产一百吨以下的小厂，这种小厂产量虽然不高，但是它具有更广泛的群众性和适应性。由小到大，由土到洋，仍然是发展地方石油工业的重要途径。我们已经初步建成了一批中小型石油工厂，目前的问题是要充分发挥这些工厂的设备能力。全国已有的中、小型石油厂的原油生产能力约达四十万吨左右，这是完成今年地方原油生产任务的最可靠的保证。在设备、器材使用上，要优先照顾那些已建成的企业，要保证供应它们成套的设备，使其能迅速正常生产。在现有的企业中，要放手发动群众，大搞技术革新和技术革命，实现生产操作半机械化和机械化，提高采油和加工的收油率，提高质量和降低成本，增产更多更好的石油产品。最后，各地还必须大抓土法炼焦收油的组织领导工作，普遍地做到“炼焦必须收油”。
    高速度发展石油工业，必须坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，坚决执行党所制订的两条腿走路的方针，在大力发展现代化、大型石油企业的同时，大办石油“小洋群”和“小土群”，使我国石油工业的发展速度大大加快，从而适应国民经济各部门对石油日益增长的需要。
