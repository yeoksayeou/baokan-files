The total industrial output value in 1959 reached 3.1 times that of 1956 and 6.1 times that of the pre-war year of 1949. By the end of June 1959, the total industrial output value plan for the first five-year (1957-1961) plan was completed two and a half years ahead of schedule. The industrial production level at the end of 1959 exceeded the 1961 level of the first five-year plan by 15%. In the first three years of implementing the first five-year plan, the total industrial output value increased by an average of 44.6% per year.

The communique stated that compared to 1958, the fuel industry increased by 35%, the mining industry increased by 34%, the metallurgical industry increased by 35%, the building materials industry increased by 88%, and the machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries doubled.

The communique stated that in 1959, the material foundation for the technological revolution was further consolidated. Due to the mass movement of "machine tools producing machine tools" carried out by various factories and enterprises, more than 13,000 machine tools were produced outside the production plan, increasing the total number of machine tools possessed by North Korea at the end of 1959 by 80% compared to the end of 1958.

In addition, in 1959, various modern production equipment such as power generation and metallurgical equipment, as well as heavy machinery such as tractors, excavators, trucks, and bulldozers, were also produced.

The communique stated that on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, the production of people's consumer goods has rapidly increased. Compared to 1958, the textile industry increased by 66%, the food industry increased by 42%, and the daily necessities industry increased by 15%.

The newly expanded irrigation capacity in 1959 could irrigate 220,000 chongbo of paddy fields and dry land, thus bringing the total irrigation capacity in northern Korea to 800,000 chongbo.

In order to promote the irrigation, electrification, and mechanization of agriculture, in 1959, the state supplied the countryside with a large number of trucks, ox carts, seeders, generators, motors, cement, and various agricultural machinery.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th. North Vietnam's total industrial output value in 1959 overfulfilled the national plan by 2.5%, an increase of 41% compared to 1958. The total cost was reduced by 3.27% compared to the planned target, and 6.14% compared to 1958. Departments such as electricity, machinery, metallurgy, mining, building materials, and light industry all overfulfilled their tasks.

This was announced by Le Thanh Nghi, Minister of Industry of Vietnam, at a meeting convened by the Ministry of Industry on the 16th to summarize the work of 1959 and propose tasks for the 1960 plan. Newspapers here today published Le Thanh Nghi's report at the meeting.

Le Thanh Nghi said that the electricity sector overfulfilled the plan by 3.2% last year, an increase of 30% compared to 1958. The total weight of products from the machinery industry sector increased threefold compared to 1958.

He said that all mining enterprises overfulfilled the 1959 plan, with net coal exceeding the plan by 3%, an increase of 40% compared to 1958. Cement production increased by nearly 80,000 tons compared to 1958.

Le Thanh Nghi said that North Vietnam built a number of light industrial enterprises in 1959 and began to put them into production. All textile factories overfulfilled the plan. The total output value of textiles increased by 21.4% compared to 1958.

He said that the workload of basic construction in the industrial sector in 1959 was equivalent to four times that of 1958. Currently, seventeen projects in the industrial sector have been completed, of which six enterprises have been put into production.

In addition, local industries have also made great achievements. All localities have built and managed 500 production units (excluding production units built by the Ministry of Commerce and the military). The total output value of local state-owned industries in 1959 was equivalent to 13% of the total output value of central state-owned industries.

Le Thanh Nghi pointed out that another remarkable achievement of the industrial sector last year was the successful completion of the reform of enterprise management. This is the main factor that strongly promoted the production and construction competition among employees of various enterprises and construction sites, and successfully completed the 1959 national plan.

He said that last year, the industrial sector trained thousands of technical cadres and workers, and promoted more than 200 cadres to serve as factory directors and other leadership positions; further improving the political, cultural, and professional level of cadres and employees.

Le Thanh Nghi then pointed out that the basic task of the industrial sector in 1960 is to strive to comprehensively and overfulfill the 1960 national plan, complete the three-year (1958-1960) plan, and prepare for the first five-year plan.

Le Thanh Nghi said that 1960 will be a year of greater victories. The 1960 plan must be completed comprehensively, balanced, and earlier. He said that we are determined to follow President Ho Chi Minh's teachings and achieve "ten points of planning, fifteen points of determination, and twenty points of measures," and are determined to strive to overfulfill the plan.
