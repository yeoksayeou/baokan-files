"Newsweek," a mouthpiece for Wall Street, Looks Forward to a Gloomy New Year
America's Days This Year Will Be Even More Unpleasant
Military Spending Will Rise, Taxes Will Be Heavier, Agriculture Will Decline, Inflation Will Increase

    This newspaper reports that "Newsweek" in the United States published a special issue in December 1959 looking forward to the New Year and the 1960s. In this issue, the publication quoted many official and non-official American figures on the prospects for the United States. Despite many attempts to disguise the fact, the publication still had to admit that the prospects for the United States in 1960 and the 1960s were very unpleasant.
    "Newsweek" admitted that the U.S. federal budget "will be getting higher and higher." The current U.S. budget is $80 billion. "By 1970, the budget may reach $100 billion to $120 billion." "Regardless of which party is in power, the federal budget will continue to rise in the next decade." In addition, the budgets of U.S. local governments will also increase year by year in the future. "Newsweek" said that U.S. local governments currently spend about $43 billion a year, three times more than ten years ago. By the mid-1960s, "local governments may spend $48 billion a year, and by the late 1960s, it may reach $55 billion."
    "Newsweek" estimates that military spending will still be the top priority in the U.S. federal budget in the 1960s. The magazine said that military spending "will definitely" continue to increase. "No matter what happens on the issue of disarmament, the huge cost of new weapons—missiles and supersonic aircraft—will increase the military budget from the current $41 billion to more than $50 billion by 1970." Pentagon experts believe that by 1970, "military spending may be as high as $80 billion, almost double the current $41 billion." "Newsweek" said that by that time, Americans may miss the current $80 billion budget, thinking that the figure is low, just as they currently view the U.S. budget before World War II.
    "Newsweek" admitted that in the coming years, due to huge military expenditures, the government will inevitably have to levy "higher and higher taxes," so "for taxpayers, the outlook is generally bleak." A statistical chart published by the magazine shows that a family of four living in New York State with an annual income of $15,000 paid only $360 in income tax in 1930, more than $3,000 in 1950, and will pay more than $3,400 in 1960. If calculated according to the total amount of U.S. tax revenue, the growth rate will be even greater, exceeding the rate cited by "Newsweek." According to U.S. official materials, on the eve of World War II, U.S. direct taxes (including income tax and property tax) were only more than $2.5 billion, accounting for 52.3% of total tax revenue. In 1950, it had increased to more than $38 billion, accounting for 74.4% of total tax revenue. In 1957, it had increased to more than $60 billion, accounting for 76.2% of total tax revenue.
    Taxes have increasingly become an unbearable burden on the shoulders of the broad masses of the American people. A cartoon in this issue of "Newsweek" also sharply satirized the U.S. government's all-pervasive tax policy. The cartoonist estimates that in the mid-1960s, dating under the moon, raising fish and birds, walking and sitting and breathing, putting ice in drinks, and taking showers will all have to be taxed by the government. This reflects the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the American people.
    When talking about agricultural production, "Newsweek" also had to admit that it is difficult to see any improvement in this area in the coming year and even throughout the 1960s. The magazine said that in 1959, the total U.S. agricultural income had already fallen by 15% (equivalent to $11.2 billion). In 1960, due to high costs and falling prices of agricultural products, farmers' income will continue to decline. Therefore, the magazine is worried that in the mid-1960s, the rural population will continue to flow into cities in large numbers. In 1933, 26% of the U.S. population (more than 32 million people) lived in rural areas. In 1958, the rural population accounted for only 12%, totaling more than 20 million people.
    According to "Newsweek," American business people believe that in the 1960s, the biggest "threat" to the U.S. economy will be inflation, the labor movement, and sharp foreign competition.
    The magazine said: "Many experts list inflation as the number one threat." If U.S. prices rise by 2% every year in the future, then the dollar, which has already depreciated, will only be equal to 80% of its current value by 1970. This is obviously an overly optimistic and unfounded estimate. In the ten years from 1949 to 1959, U.S. prices rose by more than 25%. Columnist Henry Hazlitt wrote in this issue of "Newsweek" that the main domestic problem that the United States must solve is how to stop the 26-year-long inflation. He said that the solution is to "balance the budget, and both spending and tax burden must be compressed." This is obviously impossible due to the United States' implementation of a crazy policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, with military spending rising every year. "Newsweek" admitted that inflation "will definitely be a serious danger."
    The American working class is the most direct victim of inflation. Inflation and rising prices will inevitably stimulate the rise of the American labor movement in the future. "Newsweek" quoted the words of American union leaders, pointing out the increasingly acute class contradictions in the United States. He said: "From now on, labor must fight every inch of the way."
    "Newsweek" said that in the 1960s, the United States will still face a sharp trade war as foreign businessmen continue to compete for new and larger markets in the international market. The days of getting a $6 billion surplus like in 1957 "are over." In 1959, the total value of U.S. imports and exports of goods and services was almost equal. However, if U.S. government "aid" expenditures, military expenditures, and private foreign investment are included, the U.S. payment deficit will reach $3.5 billion. Therefore, in the next ten years, "American businessmen have to carry out tenacious and long-term struggles in economic activities."
    The United States will use opening up markets and adopting tariff protection policies to strengthen its competitive power in the international market. However, "Newsweek" believes that the fundamental solution is to "seize the opportunities that come with the threat," that is, to turn competitors into its own vassals. "Newsweek" said that the "Common Market" of the six European countries has a population of 165 million, "which is one of the huge competitive threats." But it is also a huge market. At present, 143 American companies have made 169 investments in the "Common Market," including building their own factories, acquiring European companies, and joint ventures with local enterprises.
    "Newsweek" expressed infinite worry and helplessness about the increasingly declining and difficult situation of the United States and the entire capitalist camp. An editorial signed by Malcolm Muir, the editor of the magazine, wrote: "By 1970, mankind—the Russians may reach the moon." In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, "new challenges have emerged." Muir placed his hope on the so-called "spiritual power" of the United States. He said: This "spiritual power" that once made the United States "truly great" has recently "seemed to decline." "If the United States is to successfully cope with the problems and threats of the next decade, it must awaken this spirit."

    华尔街喉舌“新闻周刊”展望新年心情黯淡
    美国今年的日子更不美妙
    军费将上升　赋税将更重　农业将下降　通货将膨胀
    本报讯　美国“新闻周刊”1959年12月出版了一期展望新年和二十世纪六十年代的专辑。在这期专辑里，这家刊物引用了美国许多官方人士和非官方人士对美国前途的展望。尽管多方掩饰，这家刊物仍然不得不承认，美国的1960年和二十世纪六十年代的前景是很不美妙的。
    “新闻周刊”承认，美国的联邦预算“将越来越高”。目前美国预算是八百亿美元。“到1970年，预算可能达到一千亿到一千二百亿美元”。“不管那一个政党执政，在未来十年中，联邦预算将不断上升”。除此以外，美国地方政府的预算，在今后也将逐年增加。“新闻周刊”说，目前美国地方政府每年开支约四百三十亿美元，比十年以前增加三倍。到六十年代中叶，“地方政府每年开支可能达到四百八十亿美元，到六十年代末期可能达到五百五十亿美元”。
    “新闻周刊”估计，在六十年代，军费仍将占美国联邦预算的首位。这家杂志说，军费“肯定”会继续增加。“不管裁军问题上会发生什么事，新武器——导弹和超音速飞机——的巨大费用，将使军事预算从目前的四百一十亿美元，增加到1970年五百亿美元以上”。五角大楼专家的意见则认为，到1970年，“军费开支可能高达八百亿美元，几乎比目前四百一十亿美元增加一倍”。“新闻周刊”说，到那个时候，美国人可能会怀念目前的八百亿美元预算，认为数字很低，正如目前看第二次世界大战以前的美国预算那样。
    “新闻周刊”承认，在未来几年中，由于庞大的军事开支，政府将必然要征收“越来越高的赋税”，因此，“对于纳税人说，前景一般是黯淡的”。这家杂志发表的一个统计图表表明，一个住在纽约州每年收入一万五千美元的四口之家，在1930年仅交纳所得税三百六十美元，1950年交纳三千多美元，1960年将交纳三千四百多美元。如按美国税收总额来算，增长速度还要大，超过“新闻周刊”所举的速度。据美国官方材料，第二次世界大战前夕，美国直接税（包括所得税和财产税）仅二十五亿多美元，占税收总收入52．3％，1950年已增加到三百八十余亿美元，占税收总收入74．4％，1957年已增达六百余亿美元，占总税收76．2％。
    税收已经越来越成为美国广大人民肩上难以忍受的重担。这一期的“新闻周刊”中的一幅漫画还尖锐地讽刺了美国政府无孔不入的税收政策。画家估计在六十年代中，月下谈情，养鱼养鸟，散步起坐呼吸，饮料中放冰，洗淋浴等，都得向政府交税。这正反映了美国广大人民的不满。
    在谈到农业生产时，“新闻周刊”也不得不承认在来年以至在整个六十年代中，在这方面很难有什么起色。这家杂志说，1959年美国农业总收入已经下跌了15％（合一百一十二亿美元），1960年由于成本高涨和农产品价格下跌，农民收入将继续下降。因此，这家杂志担心在六十年代中，农村人口将继续大量流入城市。在1933年，美国有26％的人口（三千二百多万人）居住农村，1958年居住农村人口仅占12％，计二千多万人。
    据“新闻周刊”报道，美国工商界人士认为，在六十年代中，美国经济的最大“威胁”将是通货膨胀，工人运动和尖锐的国外竞争。
    这家杂志说：“许多专家都把通货膨胀列为天字第一号的威胁”。假如美国物价今后每年上涨2％，那么，目前已经贬值的美元，到1970年时将仅等于现值的80％。这显然是一种过分乐观的无根据的估计。在1949到1959十年中，美国物价上涨了25％以上。专栏作家亨利·海兹立特在这一期的“新闻周刊”中写道：美国所必须解决的国内主要问题，是如何制止持续了二十六年之久的通货膨胀。他说，解决之道是“必须平衡预算，开支和税收负担都得压缩。”这一点由于美国执行疯狂的扩军备战政策，军费每年上升，显然是无法实现的。“新闻周刊”承认，通货膨胀“肯定地将是一个严重危险”。
    美国工人阶级是通货膨胀最直接的受害人。通货膨胀、物价上涨将必然刺激今后美国工人运动的高涨。“新闻周刊”引用美国工会领袖的话，指出了美国日趋尖锐的阶级矛盾。他说：“从今以后，劳工必须进行寸土必争的战斗”。
    “新闻周刊”说，在六十年代中，由于外国商人在国际市场上继续争夺新的和更大的市场，美国将仍旧面临着一场尖锐的贸易战。像1957年那样，得到六十亿美元顺差的日子“已经过去了”。1959年，美国的进出口商品和劳务总值差不多相等。但是，如果将美国政府“援”外开支、军事开支和私人对外投资计算在内，美国支付逆差将达到三十五亿美元。因此，在未来的十年里，“美国商人在经济活动中得进行顽强的和长期的斗争”。
    美国将用开辟市场、采取关税保护政策来加强它在国际市场上的竞争力量。但是，“新闻周刊”认为，根本解决之道，还是“抓紧随着威胁而来的机会”，也就是把竞争的对手变为自己的附庸。“新闻周刊”说，欧洲六国“共同市场”有一亿六千五百万人口，“是巨大的竞争威胁之一”。但是，它也是一个巨大的市场。目前，美国已有一百四十三家公司在“共同市场”进行了一百六十九项投资，包括自建工厂、收买欧洲公司以及和当地企业联合投资。
    “新闻周刊”对于美国和整个资本主义阵营日趋没落、困难重重的情况，表示了无限担忧和一筹莫展。由这家杂志主编马尔科姆·谬尔署名的社论写道：“到1970年，人类——俄国人也许会到达月球”。在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，“新的挑战已经露头”。谬尔把希望寄托于美国的所谓“精神力量”。他说：曾经使美国变得“真正伟大”的这种“精神力量”，最近，“似乎衰退了”。“假如美国要成功地应付未来十年的问题和威胁，就一定得唤起这种精神”。
