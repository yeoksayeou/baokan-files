    Building Our Hometown with Our Own Hands
    I am an ordinary rural youth, and my wish is to use my own hands to build my hometown, change the face of the countryside, and let the new socialist countryside grow in our hands.
    When I was transferred to the farm to work on livestock breeding, some people said sarcastically, "How embarrassing it is for a young man to do this kind of work!" I have a different view. A Communist Youth League member should listen to the Party's words and do what the Party and the people need. To do this work well is to realize my aspiration.

    用双手建设家乡
    我是一个普通的农村青年，我的心愿就是用自己的一双手，建设家乡，改变农村的面貌，让社会主义的新农村，在我们手里成长起来。
    我被调到农场作牲畜配种工作时，有些人冷言冷语说：“一个青年搞这种工作，多么害羞啊！”我的看法不同，一个共青团员，应该听党的话，做党和人民需要的事情。要把这种工作做得出色，就是实现了我的志愿。
