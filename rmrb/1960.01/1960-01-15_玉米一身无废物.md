Corn: No Part is Waste
　　Agricultural Ministry, Animal Husbandry Bureau

    Corn is a good coarse grain and also a good feed. No part of it is wasted. The kernels, stalks, leaves, cobs, and husks are all feed, and all kinds of livestock like to eat it. Corn has high yields and is nutritious. Growing corn for feed is more cost-effective than growing other grains for feed. It is indeed reasonable that people call corn the "King of Feed."
    Corn kernels are a very good concentrated feed. Its chemical composition and feed units (one feed unit is equal to the nutrition contained in one kilogram of medium-quality oats) are shown in the following table:
    (Attached table)
    Corn kernels also contain abundant vitamins. One kilogram contains 5 mg of carotene, 4.6 mg of vitamin B1, 1.3 mg of vitamin B2, 14 mg of nicotinic acid, 8 mg of pantothenic acid, and 30 mg of vitamin E (one milligram is one millionth of a kilogram). Carbohydrates are indispensable for the growth, fattening, and heat production of various livestock, and corn kernels contain the most carbohydrates. The total nutritional value of corn is also the highest among all grain feeds. One hundred kilograms of corn kernels contain 135 feed units, while 100 kilograms of red sorghum only contain 117 feed units, oats only contain 100 feed units, and millet only contains 95 feed units.
    Corn stalks after harvesting the kernels, whether dried or ensiled, can be used as fodder. Corn cobs, after being crushed, can be used to feed pigs, especially suitable for feeding young pigs. Their chemical composition is shown in the following table:
　　(Attached table)
    Dry corn stalks and silage corn stalks can replace hay to feed cattle, donkeys, mules, horses, and sheep. Silage corn stalks contain more nutrients, and livestock that eat them have shiny coats and non-dry feces. Corn cobs and corn husks also contain a large amount of starch and sugar.
    Highly dense planted corn, specifically harvested as green corn for green feed or silage, also contains rich nutrition (see the table below).
    (Attached table)
    Using whole-plant silage corn to feed dairy cows can increase milk production and reduce milk costs. According to experiments, a dairy cow that eats 35 kilograms of silage corn per day produces 7% more milk than another dairy cow that only eats 13.5 kilograms of silage corn per day (the total daily nutritional intake of the two cows is equal, and the cow that eats less silage corn eats more other feeds). Feeding pigs with silage corn ears can reduce the consumption of concentrated feed and increase the meat yield; feeding sows can increase the number of piglets per litter by 3.5%, while the piglets are also more vital and have a lower mortality rate.
    The yield per unit area of ​​corn is higher than that of sorghum, millet, and other coarse grains. The kernels harvested from one mu of corn are generally 23% more than that of sorghum and 36% more than that of millet. Moreover, corn contains a wide variety of nutrients. It is estimated that the total amount of nutrition obtained from the kernels of one mu of corn is equivalent to about 1.9 mu of millet, or 1.4 mu of sorghum.
    Currently, countries with developed animal husbandry in the world grow a large amount of corn as concentrated feed and silage. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to expanding the planting area of ​​corn to promote the development of animal husbandry. The Soviet Union began to plant corn on a large scale in 1955. In 1958, the corn planting area had expanded to more than 295.8 million mu, an increase of 465% compared to 1953. In 1956, of the total corn planting area, 37% was used for green feed, 29% was used for silage, and 34% was used for harvesting kernels, and the vast majority of the harvested kernels were used as concentrated feed. Due to the large-scale cultivation of corn as feed, the animal husbandry of the Soviet Union developed rapidly. In 1956, the number of fattened pigs raised by collective farms in the Soviet Union increased 1.1 times compared to 1955, milk production increased by 50%, and meat products increased by 150%.
    China has cultivated corn for more than 400 years, and it can be planted all over the country. After liberation, the corn planting area and yield per unit area have greatly increased, which has played a positive role in the development of animal husbandry. In particular, in the past two years, a large-scale silage corn stalk movement has been carried out, and tens of billions of kilograms of silage corn stalks are stored every year, which has played a significant role in solving the problem of livestock feed and protecting livestock through the winter. Recently, many places have also processed corn cobs into pig feed with good results.
    China has a warm climate and a long corn sowing period. In the north, sowing and harvesting kernels can be done from April to June, and in the south from February to July. Because corn can be used as feed in every growth stage, in addition to harvesting kernels, it can be sown on vacant land at any time. When corn grows to the milky stage or waxy stage, it can be harvested as silage. Corn that cannot produce ears can also be used as green feed or for grazing.

    玉米一身无废物
    农业部畜牧局
    玉米是一种好杂粮，也是好饲料。它一身无废物，子实、茎、叶、穗轴、苞叶都是饲料，各种家畜都喜欢吃。玉米产量高，营养多。种玉米作饲料比种其它谷物作饲料合算，人们称玉米是“饲料之王”确有道理。
    玉米的子实是很好的精饲料，它的化学成分和饲料单位（一个饲料单位等于一公斤中等燕麦所含的营养）如下表：
    （附图表）
    玉米子实中还含有丰富的各种维生素，一公斤中含有胡萝卜素五毫克，维生素乙1四点六毫克、维生素乙2一点三毫克，烟草酸十四毫克，汛酸八毫克，维生素戊三十毫克（一公斤的百万分之一，称作一毫克）。碳水化合物是各种家畜生长、育肥和体内产生热能不可缺少的，而玉米子实含有的碳水化合物最多，在所有谷物饲料中它的营养总量也最多。每一百公斤玉米子实中含有一百三十五个饲料单位，而一百公斤红高粱只有一百一十七个饲料单位，燕麦只有一百个饲料单位，谷子只有九十五个饲料单位。
    收获子实后的玉米秸，不论晒干或青贮，都可以作饲草。玉米穗轴粉碎后可以喂猪，特别宜于喂架子猪。它们的化学成分如下表：
　　（附图表）
    干玉米秸和青贮玉米秸都可以代替谷草喂牛、驴、骡、马、羊。青贮玉米秸所含营养比较多，牲畜吃了毛色发亮、粪便不干燥。玉米穗轴和玉米苞叶也含有大量的淀粉和醣。
    高度密植玉米，专门收青玉米作青饲料或青贮饲料，也含有丰富的营养（见下表）。
    （附图表）
    利用玉米全株青贮喂奶牛，可以提高产奶量，降低牛奶成本。据试验，一头日吃三十五公斤青贮玉米的奶牛比另一头只吃十三公斤半青贮玉米的奶牛（两头牛的日粮营养总量相等，少喂青贮玉米的奶牛多喂其它饲料），产奶量多7％。用青贮玉米果穗喂猪，能减少精料消费量，提高出肉率；喂母猪能提高每窝产仔数3．5％，同时仔猪生活力强，死亡率低。
    玉米单位面积的产量比高粱、谷子等其他杂粮高。种一亩玉米所收获的子实一般比高粱多23％，比谷子多36％。而且玉米含有多种多样的营养成分，据估算，种一亩玉米从子实中所得到的营养总量相当于一点九亩左右的谷子，或者一点四亩的高粱。
    目前世界上畜牧业发达的国家，都大量种植玉米作精饲料和青贮饲料。苏联非常重视扩大玉米种植面积，以促进畜牧业的发展。苏联自1955年开始大量种玉米，1958年玉米播种面积已扩大到二亿九千五百八十多万亩，比1953年增加465％。1956年在玉米全部播种面积中，用作青饲料的占37％，用作青贮饲料的占29％，收获子实的占34％，而所收获的子实绝大部分作为精饲料。由于大种玉米作饲料，苏联畜牧业发展很快。1956年全苏集体农庄所养的肥猪比1955年增加一点一倍，牛奶产量增加50％，肉类产品增加150％。
    我国栽培玉米已有四百多年的历史，全国各地都能种植。解放后玉米播种面积和单位产量都已大大增加，这对发展畜牧业起了积极的作用。特别是近二年来，大规模开展玉米秸青贮运动，每年都收贮几百亿公斤玉米秸青贮，对解决牲畜饲草保畜过冬起了很大的作用。最近，许多地方用玉米穗轴加工作猪饲料效果也很好。
    我国气候温暖，玉米播种期较长，北方由4月到6月、南方由2月到7月都可以播种收获子实。由于玉米在各个生长阶段都能作饲料，因此除了收获子实以外，还可以随时在空地上播种，当玉米长到乳熟期、腊熟期，可收作青贮饲料，抽不出穗的玉米，也可用作青饲料或者用来放牧。
