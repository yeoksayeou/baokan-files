Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: The report performance of excellent Quyi programs, recently held in the capital, has concluded successfully. Premier Zhou Enlai and other central leaders watched the performance and had cordial conversations with the performers.

Participating in this report performance were Quyi representative teams from eight provinces and cities, the Central Broadcasting Rap Group, and the People's Liberation Army. From January 8th to 17th, they performed more than seventy Quyi programs. The report performance demonstrated the outstanding achievements made by Quyi work in 1959 in further leveraging its role as a vanguard of literature and art, serving politics and production.

The programs performed this time were mostly on modern themes, vividly reflecting the heroic figures in various aspects of China's socialist construction and the growth of people's communist morality, enthusiastically praising the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and satirizing and criticizing various bourgeois ideologies. There were also many programs depicting the struggle against the enemy, praising internationalism, or with revolutionary history as the theme. Some traditional programs that had been reorganized and improved were also performed this time. Many programs were highly ideological and artistic, and were well received by the audience.

In this performance, new Quyi genres such as Lu'an Qinshu and Jilin Qinshu, as well as new performance forms such as group singing Paizi tunes and storytelling ballad chorus, also appeared. Famous Quyi actors from various regions, including Gao Yuanjun, Liang Xiaolou, Guo Wenqiu, Hou Baolin, Sun Laikui, Liu Zongqin, Liu Yunming, Li Runjie, Deng Bixia, Chang Baohua, Wang Mingle, Sun Qiaolin, Zhang Yunxia, Ma Zengfen, and Xiao Caiwu, performed on the same stage as young actors, who accounted for about two-thirds of the performers, presenting a flourishing and prosperous scene of blooming flowers in the Quyi world.

During the report performance, the representative teams observed and learned from each other and exchanged experiences.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Culture, in summarizing this report performance, believed that it could be seen from this report performance that many excellent Quyi programs created in 1959 had made even greater leaps forward than in 1958 in terms of the depth of thought, life, and artistic innovation and improvement. The person in charge of the Ministry of Culture encouraged Quyi workers to further study Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, resolutely implement the general line, implement the literary and artistic policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," create and develop more new Quyi with socialist content and national forms, strive to improve the ideological and artistic qualities of their works, actively reorganize excellent traditional programs, and fully utilize the flexible, diverse, fresh, and lively Quyi forms that are loved by the masses to better serve socialist politics and enrich the spiritual life of the people. They should continue to adhere to going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, closely contact the masses, actively improve their political and ideological level and cultural and artistic accomplishments, further guide the amateur Quyi activities of the masses, and more systematically cultivate new forces in various Quyi genres.

    曲艺优秀节目汇报演出结束
    新华社27日讯　最近在首都举行的曲艺优秀节目汇报演出，已经胜利结束。周恩来总理和其他中央负责同志观看了演出，并且同演员们进行了亲切交谈。
    这次汇报演出，参加的有八个省市、中央广播说唱团和解放军的曲艺代表队，他们从1月8日到17日共演出了七十多个曲艺节目。汇报演出显示了1959年曲艺工作进一步发挥文艺尖兵作用，为政治、为生产服务所取得的出色成就。
    这次演出的节目，多数是现代题材，它们生动地反映了我国社会主义建设中各方面的英雄人物和人们共产主义道德品质的成长，热情地歌颂了社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社，讽刺和批判了各种资产阶级思想。还有不少节目表现对敌斗争，颂扬国际主义精神，或者以革命历史为题材。这次还演出了一些经过整理提高的传统节目。许多节目都具有较高的思想性和艺术性，深受观众好评。
    在这次演出中，还出现了潞安琴书、吉林琴书等新的曲种和群唱牌子曲、弹词合唱等新的表演形式。各地著名曲艺演员高元钧、良小楼、郭文秋、侯宝林、孙来奎、刘宗琴、刘韵茗、李润杰、邓碧霞、常宝华、王鸣乐、孙巧麟、张云霞、马增芬、小彩舞等，这次同约占三分之二的青年演员们同台演出，呈现出了曲艺界百花齐放的繁荣兴旺景象。
    汇报演出期间，各代表队互相进行了观摩学习，交流了经验。
    文化部负责人在总结这次汇报演出时认为，从这次汇报演出可以看出，1959年创作的许多优秀曲艺节目，无论在思想、生活的深度和艺术革新提高方面，都比1958年更加跃进了一步。文化部负责人勉励曲艺工作者进一步学习毛主席文艺思想，坚决贯彻总路线，贯彻“百花齐放、推陈出新”的文艺方针，更多地创作和发展社会主义内容的、民族形式的新曲艺，努力提高作品的思想性和艺术性，积极整理优秀的传统节目，充分运用灵便多样、新鲜活泼为群众喜闻乐见的曲艺形式，更好地为社会主义政治服务，丰富人民群众的精神生活；要继续坚持上山下乡，密切联系群众，积极提高政治思想水平和文化艺术修养，进一步辅导群众业余曲艺活动，更加有计划地培养曲艺界各曲种的新生力量。
