Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 3rd: "Pravda" today published a commentary stating that the US government's decision to refuse to extend the ban on atomic and hydrogen weapon tests has once again shocked good people all over the world. According to this decision, the United States can resume nuclear explosions at any time.

The commentary said that millions of people around the world were satisfied to point out that 1959 was a year without a single nuclear explosion in history. People said on the eve of the New Year: "Let's keep it that way!" But now that hope has been dimmed.

The article continued that the possibility of making the Geneva nuclear test ban conference a success has never been as realistic as it is now. Foreign observers have pointed out that the progress of the Geneva conference is primarily due to the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union. As everyone knows, the Soviet government decided that if Western countries do not conduct atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, then the Soviet Union will not resume nuclear explosions. Many Western newspapers pointed out that the constructive suggestions made by the Soviet Union in December 1959 were an important step in advancing the negotiations.

The article emphasized that the US government's decision to refuse to extend the nuclear test ban will not promote the success of the Geneva talks.

"Pravda" pointed out the criticism of the US decision in world opinion and said that the wave of criticism of the US government's decision convincingly proves that world public opinion believes that this step by the United States is unjustified.

    苏联“真理报”发表评论
    批评美国拒绝延长停止核试验期限
    新华社莫斯科3日电　“真理报”今天在一篇评论中说，美国政府拒绝延长停止原子武器和氢武器试验的期限的决定，重新在全世界善良的人们中引起了震惊。根据这一决定，美国可以在任何时间恢复核爆炸。
    评论说，全世界千百万人民曾经满意地指出，1959年在历史上是一个没有过一次核爆炸的年头。人们在新年前夕都说：“就这样保持下去吧！”但是，现在这种希望黯淡了。
    文章接着说，使日内瓦不继续核试验会议获得成功的可能性还从来没有像现在这样现实。外国观察家们都指出，日内瓦会议的进展首先是由于苏联的不懈努力。众所周知，苏联政府决定，如果西方国家不进行原子武器和氢武器的试验，那么，苏联就不恢复核爆炸。许多西方报刊指出，苏联1959年12月所提出的一些建设性建议，是使谈判前进的重要步骤。
    文章强调指出，美国政府拒绝延长停止核试验的期限的决定不可能促使日内瓦会谈成功。
    “真理报”在指出世界舆论对美国这一决定的批评后说，对美国政府这一决定的批评浪潮令人信服地证明，世界各国舆论认为美国这种步骤是毫无道理的。
