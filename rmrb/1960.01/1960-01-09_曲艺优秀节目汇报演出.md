The Ministry of Culture will hold a "Report Performance of Outstanding Quyi Programs" in Beijing from the 8th to the 15th of this month. More than 130 performing representatives from ten delegations, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, Jilin, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, the People's Liberation Army, and the Central People's Broadcasting Station, will participate in this performance. They are all outstanding actors, young actors, and students selected from various regions, such as Gao Yuanjun, Hou Baolin, Liang Xiaolou, Zhou Yunrui, Xiao Caiwu, Wang Shuxiang, Li Ruoliang, Sun Shuyun, and Ma Zengfen. They will perform twenty-three forms of Quyi, including crosstalk, single-string ballad, fast clapper talk, fast storytelling, local tunes, ballad singing with plucked stringed instrument, Suzhou ballad, Qingyin (a kind of folk music in Sichuan), ditties, and various types of drum ballads and Qinshu (a kind of folk opera). These include more than fifty programs, with new forms of Quyi created during the Great Leap Forward (“Jilin Qinshu”). These programs are mostly outstanding pieces from the performances celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country last year, of which 80% reflect the advanced deeds of advanced figures or revolutionary heroes since the Great Leap Forward, as well as excellent traditional programs that have been processed and reorganized.

This performance will combine reporting performances and public performances. In addition, there will be small-scale door-to-door performances.
