    Establishing and Consolidating the Proletarian Worldview
    Ma Laqinfu
    In the successive ideological struggles and movements in our literary and art circles, the question of writers and artists transforming their bourgeois worldview and establishing a proletarian worldview has always become the focus of the struggle between us and the bourgeoisie. The successive movements have achieved great results.
    Socialist literature is often called new literature, which shows that it is different from all bourgeois and feudalist literature and is a newborn literature with a new and great mission.
    Proletarian literature must build and develop socialism and fight for the transition to communism; create brilliant communist artistic images; and lash out at and destroy the bourgeois and all reactionary and backward ideologies. This requires our writers and artists to be communists. Without a communist worldview, it is impossible to create works with communist ideas. I have deeply realized this from my personal experience.
    I sometimes meet people engaged in literature and talk about the joys and hardships of creation. Sometimes, the works are not to my liking, perhaps because of artistic expression methods, but more often, it is because my ideological level is low, and I cannot create brilliant heroic images in my writing.
    Take Inner Mongolia as an example. The development in politics, economy, and other aspects is extremely rapid, and most importantly, people's ideological awareness has changed, or is changing. Communist or communist embryonic things are no longer a small amount, but a large amount, and they are constantly increasing and developing.
    This requires the thinking of literary and art workers to keep up. Our real life has undergone fundamental changes, and even the most remote border areas have long raised the red flag of the People's Commune.
    Our literature does not passively reflect life. It takes the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism as the principle of creation. Writers must be good at discovering those communist or communist embryonic things, and help and promote their development.
    Therefore, it requires writers to stand high, see far, see deeply, and see correctly, which requires the establishment of a communist worldview.
    Although the situation in ethnic minority areas has its own characteristics (or particularities), for ethnic minority party member writers, we are communists, and our task is to publicize socialism and communism to our people, and help the growth of their revolutionary ideological awareness and moral qualities.
    We should not lower our demands on ourselves. Then again, those who educate others must first be educated themselves. Writers must use revolutionary ideas to educate the people, and first they must be revolutionaries themselves. Most of our literary workers in Inner Mongolia are young people. We have experienced little revolutionary struggle, and our ideological level is not high enough. Establishing and consolidating a communist worldview is an extremely urgent issue for us. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, following Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy, moving forward in a down-to-earth manner, and constantly transforming ourselves, we will surely create works with a high level of ideology and art in the near future!

    建立和巩固无产阶级世界观
    玛拉沁夫
    在我国文艺界历次思想斗争运动中，作家艺术家改造资产阶级世界观、建立无产阶级世界观的问题，总是成为我们与资产阶级之间斗争的焦点。历次的运动都取得了很大的成绩。
    人们常把社会主义文学称为新文学，这说明它与一切资产阶级、封建主义文学不同，是负有新的、伟大的使命的一种新生的文学。
    无产阶级文学要建设和发展社会主义、为过渡到共产主义而斗争；创造共产主义的光辉灿烂的艺术形象；鞭挞和摧毁资产阶级和一切反动、落后的思想意识。这样就要求我们的作家艺术家，必须是一个共产主义者。没有共产主义世界观，就不可能创作出具有共产主义思想的作品来。我从切身的经验中，深深地体会到了这一点。
    我有时遇到搞文学的人，谈到创作上的甘苦，有时作品写得不称自己的意，可能是为了艺术表现方法，但更多的，是苦于自己思想水平低，笔下塑造不出光辉灿烂的英雄形象。
    就拿内蒙古来说吧，政治、经济等各方面的发展是极快的，而最重要的，是人们的思想意识变化了，或者正在变化着。共产主义的或共产主义萌芽状态的事物，已不是少量的，而是大量地出现了，而且正在不断地增多和发展着。
    这就要求文艺工作者的思想跟上去。我们的现实生活发生了根本的变化，就连从前最偏僻的边疆，也早已升起了人民公社的红旗。
    我们的文学不是消极地反映生活。它是以革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合为创作的原则。作家要善于发现那些共产主义的或共产主义萌芽状态的事物，并且帮助和促进它们的发展。
    因此，就要求作家站得高，看得远，看得深，看得正确，这就必须树立共产主义的世界观。
    少数民族地区的情况，虽然各有其特点（或特殊性），但是对少数民族党员作家来说，我们是共产主义者，我们的任务就是要向我们的人民宣传社会主义、共产主义，帮助他们的革命的思想意识、道德品质的成长。
    我们不应当降低对自己的要求。话又说回来，教育别人的人，首先自己要受教育。作家要用革命思想去教育人民，首先自己必须是革命者。我们内蒙古文学工作者绝大部分都是青年人，我们经过的革命斗争锻炼少，思想水平还不够高，树立与巩固共产主义世界观，对我们是极其迫切的问题。我们相信，在党的领导下，遵循着毛主席文艺方针踏踏实实地向前走，不断地改造自己，在不久将来，一定会创造出具有高度思想水平和艺术水平的作品！
