	Herzen – An Outstanding Revolutionary Thinker
	By Soviet Writer Ya. Aiersibeige
	The activities of the great Russian revolutionary democrats flourished in the 1860s. Herzen was such a great revolutionary democratic Russian revolutionary, thinker, and writer.

	Herzen was a brilliant writer, a philosopher of profound learning, and an enthusiastic political commentator. His legacy in theory, art, and politics is multifaceted and great. He left us classical works of philosophy and art. His political commentaries played a huge role in the political struggles of his time. Herzen's writings on the history of Russian social thought and Russian literature will always have their value. The Herzen Collected Works currently published by the Soviet Academy of Sciences include thirty volumes of his writings and letters. The twentieth volume will be published soon.

	In the early 1840s, Herzen made revolutionary and materialist solutions to basic theoretical problems. These theoretical problems occupied an unprecedentedly important position in the contemporary Russian social consciousness.

	Herzen's classical philosophical works of the 1840s, "Dilettantism in Science" (1842-1843), "Letters on the Study of Nature" (1844-1846), and his artistic works of these years, such as the novel "Who is to Blame?", the short stories "The Magpie Thief" and "Dr. Krupov," have great political significance. Herzen called for the creative mastery of the excellent property of world philosophy. He used artistic means to raise the typical problems of advanced figures, and he poetically eulogized the struggle against autocratic serf oppression. After Herzen moved to London in 1852, he began to write his outstanding autobiography "My Past and Thoughts." In this work, he created unforgettable images of advanced Russians, and he artistically exposed the universally hated autocratic serf system. "My Past and Thoughts" quickly occupied a prominent position in world literature.

	In the summer of 1857, Herzen and Ogarev, who was also living abroad, began publishing "The Bell." This was a powerful weapon of the Russian democrats in the struggle against autocracy and serfdom. In editorials, political commentaries, and short reviews, Herzen criticized the acts of arbitrariness and tyranny that caused him heartache and anger, calling for the liberation of Russia from serfdom and making people aware that the cruel oppression was unbearable.

	In 1912, Lenin wrote a famous article "In Memory of Herzen," commemorating the centenary of the birth of this great activist of the Russian liberation movement. Lenin pointed out in the article that when the proletariat commemorates Herzen, it takes him as an example to learn and understand "the great significance of revolutionary theory" (see "Lenin's Collected Works," Chinese edition, Volume 18, page 15). In fact, Herzen's life and activities particularly vividly demonstrate the historical achievements and power of advanced science and revolutionary thought. As early as the 1840s, Herzen began to scientifically demonstrate the regularity of using revolution to transform reality. "In the 1840s, in serf-owning Russia, he was able to reach the level of the greatest thinkers of the time. He understood Hegel's dialectics. He understood that dialectics is 'the algebra of revolution'. He surpassed Hegel and followed Feuerbach towards materialism." "Herzen had already come to the brink of dialectical materialism, but stopped before historical materialism." (Ibid., pp. 9-10)

	However, after the failure of the 1848 revolution, Herzen doubted the revolutionary initiative of the masses of the people, especially the Western European proletariat, and the possibility of quickly defeating the capitalist system.

	Herzen, who in the late 1840s demonstrated his socialist beliefs and faith in Russia, began to develop the theory of "Russian Socialism" and Populism. He believed that Russia could transcend the capitalist period and embark on socialism through the liberation of serfs. When commenting on Herzen's Populist ideas, Lenin said: it "is a beautiful phrase and good wishes expressing the bourgeois-democratic revolutionary nature of the Russian peasants." (Ibid., p. 11)

	While analyzing Herzen's actions and viewpoints, Lenin closely linked his analysis with the question of "the role of various classes in the Russian revolution and the international revolution." Lenin first emphasized Herzen's role in "preparing the Russian revolution," while pointing out that Russian revolutionaries occupied a certain position in the political and class struggles of Western Europe.

	The satirical conclusions Herzen drew from his observation of bourgeois society are his famous statements condemning the bourgeois system. He said: "...barbarians eat their slaves, landlords extract outrageous interest from the land, and factory owners get rich by exploiting workers; this is just the same cannibalism in disguise."

	Herzen angrily condemned the "loss of conscience and truth" of the rulers of the upper strata of bourgeois society because bourgeois society promoted the outbreak of wars and the destruction of human lives. Inspired by the idea of international friendship and solidarity, Herzen sarcastically described the hypocritical diplomatic masks of the aggressors, describing these "hypocritical diplomatic notes, sincere assurances, and cordial ultimatums."

	Herzen increasingly clearly saw the revolutionary path of opposing bourgeois rule, inspired by socialist ideals. In Herzen's later years, according to Lenin, "...his vision was not turning towards liberalism, but towards the International, towards the International led by Marx." ("Lenin's Collected Works," Chinese edition, Vol. 18, p. 11)

	The great prospects for the development of the international workers' movement were becoming increasingly clear to Herzen. Herzen firmly believed that the people's desire for socialism was maturing and would triumph. He welcomed the upsurge of the French revolutionary movement, and he called Paris, which he saw in the last months of his life, "awakened Paris." But Herzen did not live to see this true awakening—the Paris Commune. He passed away on January 21, 1870.

	Herzen's activities and his intellectual legacy were of great significance in preparing the Russian revolution. In our time, Herzen's legacy is a precious memorial to past struggles and intellectual explorations, and because there is such a wealth of ideas, such revolutionary energy and enthusiasm in this struggle and quest, Herzen's words still move, attract, and inspire people today. As Lenin said, when commemorating Herzen, the proletariat takes him as an example "...to learn and understand that boundless loyalty to the revolution and revolutionary propaganda to the people will never be in vain, even when decades separate the sowing and the harvest." ("Lenin's Collected Works," Chinese edition, Vol. 18, p. 15).

    赫尔岑——杰出的革命思想家
    苏联作家  雅·艾尔斯贝格
    俄国的伟大革命民主主义者的活动在十九世纪六十年代有了光辉的发展。赫尔岑就是这样的伟大革命民主主义的俄国革命者、思想家和作家。
    赫尔岑是一位光辉的作家、造诣渊深的哲学家和热情的政论家。他在理论、艺术和政治各方面的遗产是多方面的、伟大的。他给我们留下了古典的哲学和艺术著作。他的政论在当代的政治斗争中起了巨大的作用。赫尔岑关于俄国社会思想史和俄国文学史的著作，永远有其存在的价值。目前苏联科学院发行的赫尔岑文集，包括他的著作和信件三十卷。最近就将出版第二十卷。
    在四十年代初期，赫尔岑对于基本理论问题作了革命的和唯物主义的解决。这些理论问题在当代俄国社会意识中占有前所未有的重要地位。
    四十年代赫尔岑的古典哲学著作“科学中华而不实的作风”（1842—1843）、“论研究自然的信”（1844—1846），以及他在这些年代中的艺术作品如长篇小说“谁之罪？”、短篇小说“喜鹊贼”和“克鲁波夫医生”，具有重大的政治意义。赫尔岑号召创造性地掌握世界哲学的优秀财产。他以艺术手段提出了先进人物的典型问题，他富有诗意地歌颂了反对专制农奴制压迫的斗争。1852年赫尔岑迁居伦敦后，着手写作他的出色的自传“往事和回忆”。他在这部作品里创造了先进俄罗斯人的难忘形象，他以艺术手段揭露了万人痛恨的专制农奴制度。“往事和回忆”一书，很快便在世界文学中占据了显要的地位。
    1857年夏天赫尔岑和同是侨居国外的奥加辽夫一道开始出版“钟声报”。这是俄国民主派在反对专制和农奴制斗争中强大的武器。赫尔岑在社论、政论和短评里抨击那些使他痛心疾首，满腔激愤的专横暴戾的恶事时，呼吁从农奴制下解放俄国，使人们意识到残酷的压迫是不堪忍受的。
    列宁在1912年写了一篇著名的文章“纪念赫尔岑”，纪念这位俄国解放运动的伟大活动家诞生一百周年。列宁在文章中指出，无产阶级纪念赫尔岑时，以他为榜样来学习了解“革命理论的伟大意义”（见“列宁全集”中文版第十八卷，十五页）。事实上，赫尔岑的生平活动特别鲜明地表明了先进科学和革命思想的历史成果和威力。早在四十年代赫尔岑就开始科学地论证用革命改造现实的规律性。“他在十九世纪四十年代农奴制的俄国，竟能达到当代最伟大的思想家的水平。他领会了黑格尔的辩证法。他懂得辩证法是‘革命的代数学’。他超过黑格尔而跟着费尔巴哈走向了唯物主义。”“赫尔岑已经走到辩证唯物主义跟前，可是在历史唯物主义前面停住了”。（同上，第九、十页）
    但是在1848年革命失败后，赫尔岑对人民群众，特别是西欧无产阶级未来的革命积极性，以及对很快地战胜资本主义制度的可能性产生了怀疑。
    赫尔岑在四十年代末论证了自己的社会主义信念和对俄国的信仰，开始发展“俄国社会主义”、民粹主义的理论。他认为，俄国能通过农奴解放，超越资本主义时期走上社会主义。列宁在评论赫尔岑的民粹主义思想时说：它“是一种表示俄国农民的资产阶级民主主义革命性的美妙词句和善良愿望。”（同上，第十一页）
    列宁在分析赫尔岑的行动和观点的同时，把自己的分析同“各阶级在俄国革命和国际革命中的作用”的问题紧密联系在一起。列宁首先强调了赫尔岑在“准备俄国革命”中的作用，同时并指出，俄国革命者在西欧政治和阶级斗争中占有一定的地位。
    赫尔岑观察资产阶级社会所得出的讽刺性的结论，是他谴责资产阶级制度的名言。他说：“……野蛮人吃自己的奴隶，地主从土地上夺取骇人听闻的利息，工厂主靠剥削工人发财致富，这只不过是变相的同样吃人行为而已。”
    赫尔岑愤怒地谴责资产阶级社会的上层统治者的“丧尽良心和真理”，因为资产阶级社会促使战争爆发和毁灭人的生命。在国际友好团结思想的鼓舞下，赫尔岑冷嘲热讽地描写了侵略者的伪善的外交假面具，描写了这种“虚伪的外交照会、真诚的保证和亲切的最后通谍。”
    赫尔岑越来越清楚地看到了为社会主义理想所鼓舞的反对资产阶级统治的革命道路。在赫尔岑的晚年，根据列宁的说法，“……他的视线并不是转向自由主义，而是转向国际，转向马克思所领导的国际”。（“列宁全集”，中文版第18卷，第11页）
    国际工人运动发展的伟大前景，日益清楚地展现在赫尔岑的面前。赫尔岑坚定地相信人民对社会主义的渴望正在趋于成熟和胜利。他欢迎法国革命运动的高涨，他把在他一生最后几个月看到的巴黎称之为“觉醒的巴黎”。但是这个真正的觉醒——巴黎公社，赫尔岑却未能看到。他在1870年1月21日与世长辞了。
    赫尔岑的活动和他的思想遗产，对准备俄国革命具有重大意义。在我们的时代，赫尔岑的遗产是过去斗争和思想探索的珍贵纪念，由于在这种斗争和探求中具有这样丰富的思想，这样的革命精力和热情，所以赫尔岑的话现在仍然使人激动，吸引人，鼓舞人。正如列宁所说，在纪念赫尔岑时，无产阶级以他为榜样“……学习了解，对革命的无限忠心和向人民进行的革命宣传，即使在播种与收获相隔几十年的时候也决不会白费”。（“列宁全集”中文版第18卷，第15页）。
