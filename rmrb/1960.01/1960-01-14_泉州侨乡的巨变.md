The Jiangnan People's Commune is located on the south bank of the Jinjiang River in Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, and is a famous hometown of overseas Chinese in Quanzhou City.

The Jiangnan People's Commune was formed by merging the original Xingfu Township of Nan'an County, Shixia Township of Jinjiang County, and Sunjiang Township of Quanzhou City, consisting of seventy-one agricultural cooperatives. The commune has more than 7,500 households and over 33,000 people; among them, there are more than 2,500 households and over 10,000 people who are relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese, accounting for about one-third of the commune's population. The commune has more than 23,000 mu of cultivated land and more than 7,000 mu of longan and other fruit trees, making it a rich hometown that mainly produces grain while also engaging in diverse economic activities. However, this beautiful and rich hometown of overseas Chinese was a disaster-ridden place before liberation. At that time, due to the long-term disrepair of farmland water conservancy, the Jinjiang River often flooded. When the flood came, the fields became a vast expanse of water; after a few days without rain, drought occurred again, making life difficult for the people. In addition, the exploitation by Kuomintang bureaucrats and local bullies made the lives of farmers extremely poor. Therefore, many people here had to be forced to abandon their wives and children and brave the dangers of the sea to make a living in Southeast Asia. Chen Shuxia, a relative of overseas Chinese in Xinbu Village, had her husband orphaned at a young age. From the age of twelve or thirteen, he worked odd jobs for others. Initially, he tried every means to go to the Philippines, but as soon as he arrived there, he was imprisoned in a "water prison" by the authorities for two years because he was unwilling to be blackmailed and extorted, and was then "repatriated." After returning, he had to find another way out the following year and go to Indonesia again because life was still unsustainable under Kuomintang rule. Wu Fuyuan, the head of the commune, told me: When his father went abroad, he was already a thirty-year-old man with five children. At that time, his family had little land, and his father saw that he could not support his family by working odd jobs, so he had to leave his hometown and go to Indonesia. Although he had returned twice in between, he had to go abroad for the third time due to the difficulties of life. It was not until 1955 after liberation, when the situation in his hometown improved, that he finally returned to China and spent his old age in his hometown. In this area before liberation, how many people shed bitter tears and painfully bid farewell to their relatives before going abroad!

After liberation, through land reform and the cooperative movement, agricultural production greatly developed. After 1954, with the financial support of the People's Government, the Jinji Canal and the Jinjiang Flood Control Dam were successively built. The wide and long flood control dam blocked the often-flooding Jinjiang River and protected the villages and fields of the vast overseas Chinese hometown. The construction of the Jinji Canal introduced the Jinjiang River water, which can irrigate 100,000 mu of land here and in the eastern plains of Jinjiang County, realizing the long-cherished desire of the people to "break the Golden Rooster and irrigate southern Jinjiang." Since then, water and drought disasters have been basically eliminated here; agricultural production has had better harvests year after year; and people's lives have been improved and raised year after year. In October 1958, the Jiangnan People's Commune was established, and even greater changes have taken place here. The uneven small plots of land have become large fields in pieces; wide field roads have been built; water pumps, wind-powered waterwheels, and cattle-powered waterwheels have been installed on both sides of the Jinji Canal, the roar of the engine resounds across the fields, and the white cloth sails of the wind-powered waterwheels turn round and round in the wind... Because the People's Commune has demonstrated unparalleled superiority, in 1959 the commune's agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest. The total grain output of the commune reached more than 16.25 million catties, an increase of 36% compared with 1958. Last August and September, there were several consecutive typhoons, rainstorms, and floods here. Although the flood was blocked by the flood control dam, due to excessive rainfall and mountain floods, more than 6,000 mu of late rice fields in the commune were flooded. When the flood was receding, the commune immediately organized more than 10,000 people to drain water and wash seedlings in time; later, it vigorously added fertilizer and strengthened field management to ensure the normal growth of seedlings. After the flood, it did not rain for more than a month. Under the leadership of the Party, the commune members fought with all their strength in the fields, giving full play to the role of the Jinji Canal, pumping stations, cattle-powered waterwheels, wind-powered waterwheels, and other equipment, overcoming water disasters and drought disasters. Finally, more than 10,000 mu of late rice were able to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest under disaster conditions, with an average yield of 803 catties per mu. Together with early rice, the average annual yield per mu reached 1,234 catties. Compared with the situation before liberation, when each mu could only harvest 200 to 300 catties, it has increased by more than three times. Last year, the commune's fruit tree and vegetable production also achieved a bumper harvest. More than 4,000 mu of longan harvested more than 24,000 dan, an increase of more than ten times compared with 1958 (a small year) and four times compared with 1957 (a large year).

In addition, animal husbandry has also developed greatly. The commune now has more than 100 collective pig farms, raising more than 5,000 pigs, and more than 40,000 ducks. Commune members also raise many poultry and livestock at home. After the establishment of the commune, it established six small factories, including agricultural tool factories, hemp rope factories, and processing factories, as well as many indigenous fertilizer factories and indigenous pesticide factories, and began to have its own industry. In 1959, the total output value of the industry established by the commune reached 900,000 yuan. The deep plows, cattle-drawn waterwheels, and tiger-head carts produced by the agricultural tool factory, as well as the large number of indigenous fertilizers and indigenous pesticides produced by the indigenous fertilizer factory and the indigenous pesticide factory, played a great role in last year's bumper agricultural harvest. Since its establishment more than a year ago, the commune has also established many cultural, educational, and welfare undertakings. Now the commune has one middle school and ten primary schools, and each brigade has kindergartens, and young children are universally enrolled in school. Their fathers and brothers, many of whom did not have the opportunity to attend school; and now, they enjoy the benefits brought by the People's Commune and happily study in school. Canteens and nurseries have been universally established in each brigade, and grain is implemented on a partial supply system. People no longer have to worry about three meals a day, and the broad masses of women are no longer burdened by cooking and housework. The commune has also established a hospital, and each brigade has also established health clinics. These have opened up increasingly bright prospects for the happy lives of commune members.

The People's Commune is the "ladder" to climb to the communist paradise, and the road to a happy future. The broad masses of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese in Jiangnan Commune have already realized this. They will not forget: how their relatives were forced to go abroad to make a living due to the helplessness of life; they understand that in order to create a happy life and build their hometown more beautifully, they must actively participate in labor production. Chen Shuqiong, the production team leader of Shixia Brigade and a relative of overseas Chinese, participated in night shifts of water pumping for drought resistance for twenty-three consecutive nights and insisted on going to the city to transport fertilizer. Huang Qingyu, the party branch secretary of Xiantang Brigade and a relative of overseas Chinese, led more than 110 commune members to pump water up the mountain to resist drought, ensuring the bumper harvest of more than 200 mu of crops. Dong Xiuqin, the production team leader of Yuxia Brigade and a relative of overseas Chinese, studied and summarized production experience with commune members and learned the cultivation techniques of various crops. Many overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese have made contributions in the Great Leap Forward. Xu Zhuniang, a collective pig farm feeder and a relative of overseas Chinese, loved the commune as her home and was active in labor. She raised eleven sows alone and was rated as a "Five-Good Commune Member" by the commune members. Wu Dongpin, a production team leader and a young relative of overseas Chinese, has consistently worked actively and responsibly since the establishment of the commune, consulted with the masses in everything, and was able to take the lead in everything, giving play to the enthusiasm of the commune members, making production significantly improved, and was therefore rated as a "Five-Good Cadre." ... These many vivid examples fully illustrate that the overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese in Jiangnan Commune wholeheartedly love the People's Commune and, under the leadership of the Party, are as actively involved in the Great Leap Forward as the broad masses of commune members.

    泉州侨乡的巨变
    吴克
    江南人民公社在福建省的晋江南岸，是泉州市著名的华侨故乡。
    江南人民公社是由原来的南安县幸福乡、晋江县石霞乡、泉州市笋江乡三个乡、七十一个农业社合并成立的。全社共有七千五百多户、三万三千多人；其中侨眷、归侨就有二千五百多户、一万多人；约占全社人口的三分之一。全社有耕地二万三千多亩，龙眼等果树七千多亩，是一个以生产粮食为主、同时经营多种经济的富饶之乡。可是，就是这个美丽、富饶的侨乡，在解放前却是个多灾多难的地方。那时候，由于农田水利年久失修，晋江洪水时常泛滥成灾。大水一来，田园一片汪洋；几天没雨，却又发生旱情，弄得民不聊生。加以国民党官僚和地主恶霸的剥削，农民生活极端贫困。因此，这里的许多人不得不被迫抛妻别子，冒涉风涛险阻，前往南洋谋生。新步村侨眷陈淑霞的丈夫，小时候父母双亡，十二、三岁起就给人家打短工过活。起初，他想尽了办法到菲律宾去，可是一到那里，由于不愿受人勒索敲诈，就被当局囚禁在“水牢”里，禁了两年之后，才被“遣配”回来。回来后，由于在国民党统治下生活仍然无着，第二年又不得不另寻出路，再次南渡到印度尼西亚去了。公社社长吴复元告诉我：从前当他的父亲出国去的时候，已经是一个有了五个儿女的、三十多岁的人了。那时候，他家土地少，父亲眼见靠打短工无法维持一家人的生活，也不得不离乡背井到印度尼西亚去。中间虽然曾经两度回来，但是迫于生活困难，又不得不作第三次出国。直到解放后的1955年，家乡的光景好了，他才最后地回到国内，在家乡安度晚年。在解放前的这块地方，多少人洒下了辛酸的眼泪，忍痛告别亲人，出洋而去！
    解放后，经过了土地改革和合作化运动，农业生产大大发展了。1954年以后，在人民政府拨款支持下，金鸡水渠和晋江防洪堤相继地修建起来。宽阔、漫长的防洪堤，拦住了时常泛滥的晋江洪水，保护了广大侨乡的村庄和田园。金鸡水渠的修建，引进了晋江水，可以灌溉这里和晋江县东部平原上十万亩土地，实现了人们“破金鸡、灌晋南”的世代相传的愿望。从此，这里的水、旱灾害基本消灭了；农业生产一年比一年有了更好的收成；人们的生活也就一年年地得到了改善和提高。1958年10月，成立了江南人民公社，这里又发生了更巨大的变化。那些参差不齐的小块土地，变成了成片的大块田园；宽阔的田间大道修了起来；金鸡水渠两旁安上了抽水机、风力水车和牛力水车，发动机的轰鸣声响彻田野、风力水车的白色布帆在风中团团转动……。由于人民公社发挥了无比的优越性，1959年全社的农、林、牧、副、渔等各业生产，获得了全面的大丰收。全社的粮食总产量达到一千六百二十五万多斤，比1958年增产36％。去年8、9月间，这里曾经连续地发生过几次台风、暴雨和洪水灾害。虽然洪水被防洪堤拦住了，可是由于雨量太多，山洪暴发，全社还是有六千多亩晚稻田受淹。当大水将退的时候，公社立即组织了一万多人及时排水洗苗；以后又大力追加肥料和加强田间管理，保证了秧苗的正常生长。水灾过后，又接连一个多月没有下雨，社员们在党的领导下，全力奋战田间，发挥了金鸡水渠、抽水机站、牛力水车、风力水车等设备的作用，战胜水灾，又战胜了旱灾。终于使一万多亩晚稻在受灾的情况下，仍能获得史无前例的大丰收，平均亩产达到八百零三斤。加上早稻，全年平均亩产量达到一千二百三十四斤。和解放前每亩只能收上二、三百斤的情况相比，增加了三倍多。去年社里的果树、蔬菜生产，也获得了大丰收。四千多亩龙眼，收获了二万四千多担，比1958年（小年）增产十多倍，比1957年（大年）增产了四倍。
    此外，畜牧业也有很大发展。全社现有一百多个集体养猪场，饲养了五千多头猪，还有四万多只鸭。社员家里也饲养着许多家禽、家畜。公社在建社以后，兴办了农具厂、麻绳厂、加工厂等六个小型工厂，还有许多土化肥厂、土农药厂，开始有了自己的工业。1959年公社所兴办的工业，总产值达到九十万元。农具厂生产的深耕犁、牛拉水车、虎头车，以及土化肥厂和土农药厂生产的大批土化肥、土农药，对于去年的农业大丰收，起了很大的作用。公社成立一年多以来，还兴办了许多文教福利事业。现在全社有中学一所，小学十所，各个大队都有了幼儿园，少年儿童们普遍入学。他们的父兄辈，许多人没有可能入学；而现在，他们却享受到人民公社带来的好处，幸福地在学校里学习。各个大队普遍地办好了食堂、托儿所，粮食实行部分供给制，人们不再为一天三餐而操心了，广大妇女们再也不必受着炊事和家务的拖累了。公社还办了一所医院，各个大队也都建立了保健室。这些，都为社员们的幸福生活敞开了愈来愈灿烂的前景。
    人民公社是登上共产主义天堂的“天梯”，是通向幸福前途的道路。江南公社的广大侨眷、归侨都已经认识到这一点。他们不会忘记：他们的亲人是怎样地迫于生活无奈才出国谋生去的；他们懂得要想创造幸福生活，把家乡建设得更美丽，就要积极参加劳动生产。石霞大队生产队长、侨眷陈淑琼，一连二十三个晚上参加夜班车水抗旱，还坚持进城运肥料。仙塘大队党支部书记、侨眷黄清玉，带领了一百一十多个社员，车水上山抗旱，保住了二百多亩作物的丰收。玉霞大队生产队长、侨眷董秀琴和社员们一起研究、总结生产经验，学会了各种作物的栽培技术。许多侨眷、归侨在大跃进中立了功。集体养猪场饲养员、侨眷许注娘爱社如家，劳动积极，她一个人饲养了十一头母猪，被社员评为“五好社员”。生产队长、侨眷青年吴东品，自从公社成立以来，一贯工作积极负责，事事和群众商量，又能事事带头，发挥了社员的干劲，使得生产显著提高，因而被评为“五好干部”。……这许多生动的事例，充分地说明了江南公社的侨眷、归侨们，是衷心地热爱人民公社，在党的领导下，和广大社员们同样积极地投入了大跃进浪潮。
