Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: Leading cadres of various departments of the central state organs, in their leadership work in 1959, widely implemented the important Marxist-Leninist principle of "combining leadership with the masses, and combining mental labor with physical labor." According to the Party's regulations last year, leading cadres should spend at least four months each year delving into the grassroots, combining with the masses, and combining with productive labor. Over the past year, most leading cadres have implemented this regulation, greatly improving their leadership style.

According to preliminary statistics from thirty-eight units of central state organs, the majority of leading cadres at the department and bureau director level or above spent time in factories, mines, communes, reservoirs, and shops in 1959, working as laborers, apprentices, or commune members. Among them, 73.2% of leading cadres at the ministerial level went to the grassroots, and 60.4% at the department and bureau director level. Some of these leading cadres spent more than four months at the grassroots, while others spent less, with a few spending more than half a year there. For example, Wang Zhen, Minister of Reclamation, spent most of last year at the grassroots. Zhao Erlu, Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, and Vice Ministers Duan Junyi, Zhang Liankui, Liu Ding, and Bai Jian all spent more than four months at the grassroots. All eight ministers and vice ministers of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and fifty-nine department and bureau directors, except for five department and bureau directors, took turns going to factories, workshops, and mines. Other departments, such as the Ministry of Commerce, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and the State Capital Construction Commission, had nearly 80% or 90% of their department and bureau director level cadres or above going to the grassroots.

When these leading cadres at the department and bureau level and above went to the grassroots, they appeared among the masses as ordinary laborers. Some became commune members, others became apprentices. They closely combined physical labor with in-depth investigation and research, not only achieving the goal of improving their work style, but also solving many practical problems in production and work. Wu Bo, Vice Minister of Finance, worked as a commune member in the Lugouqiao People's Commune, laboring alongside the commune members, who affectionately called him "Old Man." Through labor, Wu Bo learned a lot about the situation and studied some issues related to financial and trade work, reporting these issues to the relevant central and Beijing municipal departments. Liu Zihjiu, Vice Minister of Labor, once worked as an apprentice at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory for a month. He humbly said, "Going to the production workshop showed that I was completely an amateur, unable to do anything. The month I spent working in the factory was actually spent standing next to the lathe, watching the master, handing him parts, sweeping the floor, fetching water, and cleaning the lathe and tools." However, this month-long apprenticeship gave him some knowledge and experiences that he could not have gained during previous visits to the factory. Based on his experiences, he made several suggestions to the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the factory leadership on how to improve factory management. Now, Liu Zihjiu has established a regular relationship with the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory. No matter how busy he is, he goes to the factory almost every month to see his master, senior and junior apprentices, and learn about the situation and problems in production. He feels that this approach is very beneficial to himself and to his work.

There are many methods for leading cadres to go to the grassroots to conduct investigations and research. Some go to inspect work, some reside permanently in experimental fields and bases, some convene on-site meetings, and some adopt a combination of "riding a horse to see the flowers" and "dismounting to see the flowers," extensively and deeply connecting with reality and the masses. Liu Ruilong, Vice Minister of Agriculture, said that the ministers of the Ministry of Agriculture have all adopted a combination of "riding a horse to see the flowers" and "dismounting to see the flowers" to conduct investigations and research at the grassroots. Liu Ruilong himself has been to more than twenty people's communes to learn about the planting, growth, and field management of wheat, rapeseed, rice, and cotton. Liu Ruilong gained a general understanding by "riding a horse to see the flowers" and absorbed the experience summarized by the local Party committees. Then, he "dismounted to see the flowers," selecting several communes that had done a relatively good job in these areas and engaging in in-depth and detailed discussions with experienced veteran commune members, young activists, leading cadres, and scientific workers to study the growth and development laws of these four major crops and the laws of applying the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. After such extensive and in-depth investigation and research, Liu Ruilong believes that if the Eight-Point Charter is conscientiously implemented according to specific circumstances, it is currently possible to achieve a yield of 1,000 jin per mu for wheat, 2,000 jin per mu for rice, and 200 jin per mu of ginned cotton on a large scale. It is also possible to achieve even higher yields on smaller areas. Wang Zhen, Minister of Reclamation, spent most of last year in state-owned farms in Beidahuang and Guangdong and Hainan Island. In the state-owned farms in Beidahuang, he and the masses focused on studying the problem of close planting of soybeans. Experiments have proved that it is possible to plant more than 30,000 soybean plants per mu, and the past experience of wide ridges and sparse planting of more than 15,000 plants is outdated. Wang Zhen absorbed the experience of the masses and widely promoted the experience of close planting of soybeans in the state-owned farms in Beidahuang. As a result, despite the fact that soybeans suffered from fairly serious drought and flood disasters last year, they still increased production by nearly one time compared with previous years, achieving a particularly large harvest.

Through the investigation and research of leading cadres at the grassroots level, not only was the situation fully understood, but problems could also be solved quickly on the spot, the style of the leading organs was improved, and the work was powerfully promoted. Last year, leading cadres at the department and bureau level and above of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held more than 100 on-site meetings and professional meetings in various places, trained more than 10,000 technical cadres, and promptly solved many problems in steel production. In the past year, Liu Ding, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, went to eight provinces, eleven cities, and forty-one factories to inspect production, helped to rectify the production order of some factories, solved the problem of allocating major materials, and promoted the "cast steel surfacing welding die," which has great technical revolutionary significance. The new process of welding structure was widely promoted for the manufacture of important products such as hydro-turbines, and a nationwide plan was made for hydro-turbine manufacturing.

The Party Committee of the Central State Organs believes that in the past year, the execution of the Central Committee's decisions by the leading cadres at the department and bureau level and above of various organs has been successful and has played a great role in work and production. However, there are still some units that have not paid enough attention and have not implemented the decisions well enough. The Party Committee requires all departments to conscientiously implement the instructions of the Central Committee in 1960. All leading cadres at the department and bureau director level and above must take turns going down to conduct investigations and research for four months each year, and they must closely combine in-depth investigation and research at the grassroots with participation in one month of physical labor. Through physical labor, they can better integrate with the masses, improve their leadership style, and closely combine leadership with the masses.

### 吸取基层经验　改进领导作风  中央国家机关大部负责同志去年深入调查研究和参加劳动

    吸取基层经验　改进领导作风
    中央国家机关大部负责同志去年深入调查研究和参加劳动
    新华社27日讯　中央国家机关各部门的负责干部，在1959年的领导工作中，广泛地贯彻了“领导和群众相结合，脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合”这一重要的马克思列宁主义原则。按照党在去年的规定，领导干部今后每年至少要有四个月的时间深入基层，同群众相结合，同生产劳动相结合。过去的一年来，大部分领导干部执行了这一规定，使领导作风得到了很大的改进。
    根据中央国家机关三十八个单位的初步统计，司局长级以上的领导干部，在1959年内大多数都深入了工厂、矿山、公社、水库、商店当工人、当学徒、当社员。其中部长一级领导干部深入基层的达到73．2％，司局长一级干部占60．4％。这些领导干部深入基层的时间，有的超过了四个月的时间，也有的不满四个月，个别的大半年时间都在基层。例如农垦部部长王震，去年大半年的时间都在基层。第一机械工业部部长赵尔陆，副部长段君毅、张连奎、刘鼎和白坚到基层去的时间都在四个月以上。冶金工业部正副部长八名，司局长五十九名，除五名司局长外，全部轮流深入到工厂、车间、矿山。其他如商业部、华侨事务委员会和国家基本建设委员会等部门到基层去的司局长级以上干部，差不多都在80％或90％以上。
    这些司局以上领导干部在深入基层时，都以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现在群众之中，有的当社员，有的当学徒，他们把参加体力劳动和深入调查研究紧密地结合起来，不仅达到改进作风的目的，而且解决了许多生产和工作中的实际问题。财政部副部长吴波在芦沟桥人民公社当社员时，同社员们一起劳动，社员亲切地称呼他“老头儿”。吴波通过劳动了解了许多情况，研究了一些和财政贸易工作有关的问题，并将这些问题分别向中央和北京市各有关部门作了反映。劳动部副部长刘子久曾经在长辛店机车车辆厂当了一个月的学徒，他谦虚地说：“到生产车间就显出自己完全是一个外行，什么都不会，自己下厂劳动的一个月，实际上是在车床旁边站了一个月，在师傅旁边看了一个月，给师傅递点零件、扫扫地、打打开水、清理清理车床和工具”。可是在这一个月的学徒生活中，使他得到了过去下厂过程中得不到的一些知识和体会。他根据自己的体会，向北京市委和厂的领导上提出了若干关于改进工厂管理工作的建议。现在，刘子久同长辛店机车车辆厂建立了一种经常的联系，无论工作怎样繁忙，他差不多每个月都要去厂里看看师傅、师兄师弟，了解生产中的情况和问题，他觉得这种办法对自己对工作都很有好处。
    领导干部深入基层调查研究的方法很多。有的下去检查工作，有的在试验田、基地常驻，有的召开现场会议，有的采取“走马看花”和“下马看花”相结合的方式，广泛深入地联系实际，联系群众。农业部副部长刘瑞龙说，农业部的部长们都采取了“走马看花”和“下马看花”相结合的方式深入基层调查研究。刘瑞龙本人曾经到过二十多个人民公社，了解小麦、油菜、水稻、棉花的播种、生长和田间管理情况。刘瑞龙走马看花地了解了一般的概况，吸取各地党委总结的经验，然后下马看花，选择几个这方面工作做得比较好的公社，深入细致地同有经验的老社员、青年积极分子、领导干部和科学工作者座谈，研究了这四种主要作物的生长发育规律和运用农业八字宪法的规律。经过这样广泛深入的调查研究，刘瑞龙认为，如果根据具体情况，认真贯彻八字宪法，目前在大面积上小麦亩产千斤、水稻亩产双千斤、棉花亩产二百斤皮棉是可以实现的。在较小的面积上，实现更高的产量，也是可能的。农垦部部长王震去年大部分时间都是在北大荒和广东、海南岛等地国营农场度过的。他在北大荒各国营农场中同群众一起着重研究了大豆密植的问题，经过试验证明：一亩地密植大豆三万多株是可以的，过去宽垅稀植一万五千多株的经验已经过时。王震吸取了群众的经验，把大豆密植的经验在北大荒各国营农场普遍推广后，结果尽管去年大豆遭受了相当严重的旱涝灾害，但仍比往年增产将近一倍，获得了特大丰收。
    通过领导干部深入基层调查研究，不仅充分地了解了情况，而且可以就地迅速解决问题，改进了领导机关的作风，有力地推动了工作。冶金工业部司局以上领导干部去年深入基层在各地召开了一百多次现场会议和专业会议，训练了一万多名技术干部，及时解决了许多钢铁生产中的问题。第一机械工业部副部长刘鼎在去年一年里到了八个省，十一个市，四十一个工厂去检查生产，帮助整顿了有些厂的生产秩序，解决了主要材料的调剂问题，并推行了具有重大技术革命意义的“铸钢堆焊锻模”，对制造水轮机等重要产品广泛推行了新工艺——焊接结构，对水轮机制造进行了全国性的规划。
    中央国家机关党委认为，在过去一年里，各机关司局以上领导干部执行中央的决定是有成绩的，对工作和生产起了很大作用。但是也还有些单位重视不够，执行得不够好。党委要求各部门在1960年要认真执行中央的指示，所有司局长以上领导干部必须每年轮流下去四个月进行调查研究，而且一定要把深入基层调查研究和参加一个月的体力劳动紧密地结合在一起，通过体力劳动，更好地和群众打成一片，改进领导作风，使领导和群众紧密地结合起来。
