    Introducing Directional Blasting for Soil Extraction
    Wu Yikuang
    Directional blasting is an advanced method of earthwork construction. It not only loosens large quantities of earth and rock but also lifts and throws them to a pre-determined location according to plan. In a matter of seconds, it can fill a ditch or build a dam, saving labor and increasing efficiency not by ten or eight times, but by dozens or hundreds. This method can be promoted and used in the current water conservancy movement.
    Why can the blasted soil and rock fly in a specified direction? There is a scientific reason for this. We know that the explosion phenomenon is not a chaotic scattering of stones and clods, but a regular burst in the direction of the thinnest soil layer. If the explosive is placed at the center of a spherical body open on all six sides, because the soil layer on all six sides is of the same thickness and the resistance is the same, the explosion will develop evenly in all six directions, resulting in a six-sided flower. If it explodes on a hillside, the displaced earth and rock will fly to the front of the hillside (as shown in Figure 1), because the soil layer behind the explosive is thick and will not be blasted out. This is the most basic principle of how blasting can be directional.
    If we want to build an earth dam, we need the blasted earth to pile up together. But how can we make the earth pile up? This requires making use of the terrain. If the ground is concave, we can place several explosive packages under the concave ground, with the smallest line of resistance (the thinnest soil layer around the explosive) of each explosive package facing the planned landing point. In this way, the explosive force of each explosive package will burst out along the smallest line of resistance, and the earth will be concentrated in the direction of the center. If the natural ground is not concave, an auxiliary explosive package can be used to blast it into a concave shape first (as shown in Figure 2), and then the main explosive package can be blasted, which will also throw the earth into a concentrated pile. For building dams with directional blasting, it is best to build the dam on a concave riverbed.
    In the design of directional blasting for dam construction, two main problems need to be solved: first, determining the location of the explosive packages; second, determining the amount of explosives. The location of the explosive packages can be determined as follows: first, determine the depth of the main explosive package buried in the slope according to the amount of earth needed for the dam. The deeper it is buried, the higher the dam will be; the shallower it is buried, the lower the dam will be. The main explosive package can generally be arranged in a circular arc shape, as shown in Figure 2, arranged as several concentrated explosive packages; or as shown in Figure 3, arranged in a strip shape. The degree of curvature of the explosive package can generally be centered on the riverbed; the length of the explosive package can be determined according to the width of the dam, just as the location of the explosive package is determined according to the amount of earth used in the dam body. As for how much explosive to use, you can check the blasting manual or determine it through experiments. (Attached pictures)

    介绍定向爆破取土
    吴一匡
    定向爆破是一种先进的土石方施工方法，它不仅能松动大量的土石方，并且能够掀起大量的土石方，按照人们的计划，抛掷到预先规定的地方去。在几秒钟之间，填平沟、筑成坝，节省的劳力，提高的工效不是十倍八倍，而是几十倍，成百倍。这种方法可以在目前的水利运动中推广使用。
    为什么能使炸出的土石飞向指定的方向呢？这里边有个科学道理。我们知道爆炸现象不是乱七八糟的把石头土块炸散，而是有规律的向着土层最薄的方向爆发。如果把炸药放在六面临空的圆球体中心爆炸，因为六面的土层都一样厚，抵抗力的大小都一样，爆炸就会均匀的向六面发展，炸成个六面开花。如果在一座山坡上爆炸，炸动的土石方就会飞向山坡的前方（如图一），因为炸药后面的土层厚，不会被炸出来。这就是爆破能够定向的最基本的道理。
    我们要筑个土坝，就要求炸出的土方能够堆到一块。但是，怎样才能让土方堆到一块呢？这就要利用地形，假若地面是凹形的，我们在凹地面下安置几个炸药包，每个炸药包的最小抵抗线（炸药四周土层最薄的地方）都向着计划中的落土地点。这样每个炸药包的爆炸力都顺着最小抵抗线爆发出来，土就会集中于圆心方向。假若天然地面不是凹形的，可以利用辅助药包先把它爆成个凹形（如图二），然后主药包再爆破，也会把土集中地掷到一块。用定向爆破筑坝，最好坝筑在凹形的河道上。
    定向爆破筑坝设计中，主要要解决两个问题：第一、决定药包位置；第二、决定炸药量。药包位置可以这样来决定：首先根据坝所需要土方的多少，来决定主药包埋置在坡面内的深度。埋的深，筑成的坝就高，埋的浅，筑成的坝就低。主药包一般可以布置成圆弧形，可以如图二，布置成几个集中的药包；也可以如图三，布置成条形。药包弯曲的程度一般可以河床中心为圆心；药包的长短，可以像根据坝身用土多少决定药包位置一样，根据坝身的宽度来确定。至于用多少炸药，可以查看爆破手册或者试验确定。（附图片）
