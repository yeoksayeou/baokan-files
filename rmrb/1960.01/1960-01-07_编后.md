Since the Great Leap Forward, China's literary and artistic work has also undergone unprecedented development. Mass art and literature have blossomed everywhere, and professional creation has also seen great prosperity and improvement. This is a victory for Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art. The successive political and ideological movements have had a tremendous impact on the ideological education of literary and artistic workers. Many writers and artists have gained new insights through work, study, and delving into the lives of the masses, improving their ideological cultivation in aspects such as class viewpoint, labor viewpoint, mass viewpoint, and collective viewpoint. The success of their works and performances is inseparable from progress in these areas. Many of them have honorably joined the Communist Party of China. Under the education and nurturing of the Party, many new talents have emerged on the literary and artistic front.

As the new year begins, we have invited some literary and artistic figures to write about their further requirements for themselves in the future. Today, we are publishing some of the manuscripts we have already received here. Their authors are: novelist Liu Qing, whose new work "Entrepreneurship" Part 1 has just been published; film actor Cui Wei, who is currently filming "Red Flag Spectrum"; landscape painter Guan Shanyue; Mongolian youth writer Mala Qinfu; Wang Anyou, the author of "Li Ersao Remarries"; Ru Zhijuan, the author of short stories such as "Lily"; and Feng Deying, the author of the novel "Bitter Vegetable Flowers." They all emphasized that literary and artistic workers must strengthen their study of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly establish a proletarian worldview, and are full of confidence to create more and better works. We hope to continue to receive pen talks from other literary and artistic figures.

    编后
    大跃进以来，我国的文艺工作，也有空前的发展。群众文艺遍地开花，专业创作也有很大的繁荣和提高，这是毛泽东文艺思想的胜利。历次的政治思想运动对于文艺工作者的思想教育作用是巨大的，许多作家和艺术家在工作学习和深入群众生活的锻炼中取得了新的收获，在阶级观点、劳动观点、群众观点、集体观点等思想修养方面有了提高。他们的作品和演出的成功，是和这些方面的进步分不开的。他们当中不少人光荣地加入了中国共产党。在党的教育和培养下，文艺战线上涌现了许多新人。
    在新的一年开始的时候，我们约请一部分文艺家来笔谈今后对自己的进一步的要求。今天把已经收到的部分稿子发表在这里。它们的作者是：小说家柳青，他的新作“创业史”第一部刚发表；电影演员崔嵬，他正在进行“红旗谱”的拍摄工作；国画家关山月；蒙族青年作家玛拉沁夫；“李二嫂改嫁”的作者王安友；短篇小说“百合花”等的作者茹志鹃和长篇小说“苦菜花”等的作者冯德英。他们都强调指出文艺工作者必须加强学习毛泽东思想，巩固地树立起无产阶级的世界观，他们满怀信心地要创造更多更好的作品。我们希望继续收到别的文艺家的笔谈稿。
