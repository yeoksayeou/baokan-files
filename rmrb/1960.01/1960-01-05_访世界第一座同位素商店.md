    Visiting the World's First Isotope Store

    In the southwest district of Moscow, with its rows of new buildings, an atomic symbol atop a nine-story building attracts the attention of people from near and far. The world's "one and only" isotope store, which opened not long ago, is located on the ground floor of this building. Recently, we visited this extraordinary store with excitement.

    At the entrance of the store, the eye-catching Russian word "Isotopes" is prominently displayed. In the large showcase are various devices and equipment that utilize isotopes.

    Upon entering the store, the first thing that catches the eye is the Mendeleev periodic table of chemical elements, mounted on a huge glass panel. Each chemical element's box contains a series of isotopes, many of which are marked with red and green colors. Isotopes marked in red and green are the "commodities" of this store.

    Isotopes – the name is no longer unfamiliar to people, as it increasingly demonstrates its role in both production and life. For example, isotopes can become people's eyes for seeing through objects, helping them inspect product quality and survey mineral deposits. They are also keen machine inspectors, helping people manage production. In addition, they can treat several important diseases, promote early maturity of plants, and increase yields. Decades ago, when people first discovered isotopes, no one had imagined such a great role for them, let alone the emergence of a store specializing in isotopes today, and that the variety of goods in this store would be so diverse. The store sells two hundred and thirty kinds of stable isotopes and one hundred and ten kinds of radioactive isotopes, and soon the variety of "goods" here will greatly increase.

    Indeed, this is no ordinary store. It is a sign that isotopes have been widely used in various sectors of the Soviet Union and a testament to the great achievements of the Soviet Union in the development and research of isotopes.

    The interior of this store can be basically divided into two parts. The first part displays isotope samples and various equipment utilizing isotopes. In a bright, large glass cabinet, we saw colorful isotope samples contained in test tubes. A technical instructor at the store told us that a total of one thousand one hundred and twenty-eight isotopes have been discovered in the Soviet Union, most of which are artificially produced, except for two hundred and seventy stable isotopes and forty-odd natural isotopes. Most of the isotopes sold in the store, including the cobalt isotope widely used in medicine, are made using atomic reactors.

    These novel "commodities" left us with a deep and fresh impression. There is a gamma-ray relay, which uses the radioactive effect of cobalt-60 to automatically check the working conditions on the production lines of factories and enterprises. Another radioactive detector, which looks like an ordinary household vacuum cleaner, can help geological prospectors find radioactive materials underground. Here, we also saw pocket-sized and pen-style dosimeters. These small instruments can indicate the level of radioactivity in the air around you.

    The second part of the store is filled with various protective equipment, which are weapons for taming the wildness of radioactivity, preventing it from harming people's health, and letting it obediently serve people. Here are various protective suits and safety containers for transporting radioactive isotopes. The safety containers are made of steel, and they come in different sizes and shapes, the largest of which weighs more than one ton. Here, we also saw the "mechanical hands" widely used in hospitals and laboratories, but its structure is more refined and dexterous, and all its accessories can isolate radiation.

    When visiting the isotope store, the first thing people feel is the vigorous development of Soviet science and the clear characteristics of Soviet science serving production.

    Since its opening, the isotope store has been very "busy." Store manager Chiziganov said that now not only research institutions and factories in Moscow are ordering goods from the store, but also people from Belarus and Ukraine have come to order goods. Many foreign guests also come to visit.

    In the store, there is a small cinema where we saw a scientific documentary about the use of isotopes in Soviet medicine. In the small reading room attached to the store, one can read books and periodicals about isotopes and the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    The Moscow isotope store was opened by the State Committee on Chemistry of the Soviet Union. The opening of this store indicates that the scale of peaceful use of atomic energy in the Soviet Union is expanding. As store manager Chiziganov said: "We hope to make isotopes serve the Soviet people more widely through this store. Because the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union serves the cause of peace."

### 访世界第一座同位素商店

    访世界第一座同位素商店
    在莫斯科新厦林立的西南区，一座九层新楼顶上的原子标志，吸引着远远近近的人们的注意。不久前开幕的世界上“独此一家”的同位素商店，就设在这幢楼房的最下层。最近，我们怀着兴奋的心情访问了这个奇异的商店。
    商店入口处，迎面是醒目的“同位素”俄文字样。在巨大的橱窗里陈列着各种各样利用同位素的设备和器材。
    走进商店以后，首先引起注意的是装置在巨大玻璃板上的门德雷叶夫化学元素周期表，在每个化学元素的小框框里都有一系列同位素，其中许多标着红红绿绿的颜色。凡是用红绿颜色标出的同位素都是这座商店的“商品”。
    同位素，人们对这个名字已经不太陌生了，因为它无论在生产和生活方面都日益广泛地显示出了它的作用。例如，同位素可以成为人们透视物体的眼睛，它可以帮助人们检查产品质量、勘测矿藏，它也是敏锐的机器检查员，能帮助人管理生产，此外，还能治疗若干重要疾病，促使植物早熟、增加产量等。几十年前，当人们刚刚发现同位素的时候，谁都不曾想到它这样大的作用，更没有想到今天会出现这种专售同位素的商店，而且在这商店里的商品种类又会是如此的繁多。单是在这里门售的稳定性同位素有二百三十种，放射性同位素一百一十种，而且不久这里的“商品”种类还将大大增加。
    的确，这不是一个普通的商店，这是同位素已经在苏联各部门得到广泛应用的一个标志；是苏联在发展和研究同位素方面取得巨大成就的证明。
    这个商店的内部基本可分成两个部分。第一部分陈列着的是同位素的样品和利用同位素的各种器材。在一个明亮的大玻璃柜中，我们看到了五颜六色的装在一个个试管里的同位素样品。商店的一位技术指导员向我们介绍说，目前在苏联已经发现了的同位素共有一千一百二十八种，其中除去二百七十种稳定的和四十多种天然同位素以外，大部都是人工制造的。而商店所出售的大部同位素，包括医学中广泛应用的钴的同位素，则是利用原子反应堆制成的。
    这些新奇的“商品”，给我们留下了深刻而又新鲜的印象。有一种丙种射线替续器，它利用钴60的放射作用可以自动地检查工厂企业作业线上的工作情况。另一个好像普通家用吸尘器似的放射性检查器，它可以帮助地质勘探人员找到地下的放射物质。在这里我们还看到了袖珍型和钢笔式的线量计。这些小巧的仪器可以向人们表示出在你周围空气中的放射性程度。
    商店的第二部分摆满了各种防护用具，这是驯服放射性的野性的武器，防止它伤害人的健康，而让它乖乖地为人们服务。这里有各种防护服、运送放射性同位素的安全筒。安全筒是钢铁制成的，它的大小形式各有不同，最大的一种有一吨多重。在这里我们还看到了医院和实验室里广泛应用的“机械手”，不过它的构造更为精细、灵巧，它的附带设备全都可以隔绝放射线。
    在参观同位素商店时，人们首先感到的就是苏联科学的蓬勃发展，和苏联科学为生产服务的鲜明特征。
    同位素商店自从开幕以后“生意”非常兴隆，商店经理齐兹加诺夫说，现在到商店订货的不但有莫斯科的各研究机关和工厂企业，而且从白俄罗斯和乌克兰也已有人来订货。还有许多外国客人前来参观。
    在商店里有一个小电影厅，我们在这里看到了苏联医学利用同位素的科学纪录片，在商店附设的小阅览室里可以读到有关同位素和和平利用原子能的书籍、刊物。
    莫斯科同位素商店是苏联国家化学委员会开设的，这座商店的开幕表明了苏联和平利用原子能的规模日益扩大，正如商店经理齐兹加诺夫所说的：“我们希望通过这个商店使同位素更广泛地为苏联人民服务。因为苏联的先进科学技术就是为和平事业服务的。”
