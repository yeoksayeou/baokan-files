    Jointly Tackle Key Problems

    To promptly strengthen weak links and adjust the relationships between various work types and processes within factories and enterprises is a very important issue in organizing an overall leap forward in industrial production.

    At present, insufficient casting capacity is a relatively prominent weak link in many machinery factories. This is because the casting work in many factories is still done manually, with low production efficiency and unstable quality, and it is increasingly unable to meet the needs of rapidly developing machining workshops. For example, in Tianjin's machinery manufacturing industry, the number of foundry workers engaged in manual labor accounts for 87.68%; however, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the machining departments is as high as 96.98%. Under the situation of rapid production development, the contradiction between modern machining departments and manual casting departments is becoming increasingly prominent. How to solve this contradiction and strengthen this weak link? Tianjin has provided a very good experience. This is to organize large-scale collaboration to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of casting work, and to increase the output per unit area of castings.

    Changing from manual operations that have been used for many years to mechanized and semi-mechanized operations will inevitably encounter some difficulties, such as raw material problems, equipment problems, technical strength problems, etc. Most of these difficulties can be solved by relying on the wisdom and strength of the masses. However, some problems cannot be solved by one factory or one workshop relying on its own strength, especially for small and medium-sized factories with weak technical strength and insufficient equipment capacity, the difficulties will be even greater. Tianjin's method of organizing various factories and enterprises to implement professional collaboration, division of labor, and focus on key points is a very good method. This not only solves the above-mentioned difficulties, but more importantly, it can give full play to the strengths of various enterprises, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, support each other, and concentrate forces. Moreover, because they are all in the same industry, they know the situation of the industry best, and the key points can be accurately grasped, and the effect will be greater.

    Tianjin's approach can be widely promoted. Every city, every region, and every industry will have its own weak links, and in the technical innovation movement, there will be relatively difficult fortresses to conquer. For these common weak links and technical innovation topics, line them up, organize the "peers" from the entire city, the entire province, or even the entire country, and launch a concentrated attack with all our strength. Victory will definitely come faster than fighting alone, and the results will definitely be more perfect.

    Last year, many regions and industrial departments relied on the strength of large-scale collaboration to achieve a great leap forward in production; this year, we must continue to exert the power of large-scale collaboration to win the great victory of the technical revolution, so as to ensure the continuous leap forward in production.

### 协力攻关

    协力攻关
    及时加强薄弱环节，调整工厂企业内部各工种、工序的关系，是组织工业生产全面跃进的一个十分重要的问题。
    目前，在许多机械厂中，铸造能力不足是一个比较突出的薄弱环节。这是因为许多工厂的铸工工种还是手工操作，生产效率低，质量也不稳定，因此已日益不能适应飞速发展的加工车间的需要。例如，天津市机械制造工业的铸造工人中，从事手工劳动的人数占87．68％；但是机械加工部门的机械化半机械化程度却高达96．98％。在生产飞速发展的形势下，现代化的加工部门和手工操作的铸工部门之间的矛盾，表现得越来越突出了。怎样解决这一矛盾，加强这个薄弱环节呢？天津市提供了很好的经验。这就是组织大协作，实现铸工的机械化半机械化，提高铸件的单位面积产量。
    把沿用多年的手工操作改为机械化半机械化的操作，必不可免地会遇到一些困难，如原材料问题、设备问题、技术力量问题等等。这些困难，依靠群众的智慧和力量，大都是可以解决的。但是，也有些问题，不是一个厂或一个车间依靠自己的力量所能解决得了的，特别是一些中、小型工厂，技术力量薄弱，设备能力不足，困难就会更多。天津市把各个工厂企业组织起来，实行专业协作，分工负责，猛攻关键，是一个很好的方法。这样作不仅解决了上述困难，更重要的是可以发挥各企业的专长，取长补短、互相支援、力量集中。而且因为都是同行，对本行业的情况了解得最清楚，关键也就能抓得准，效果也比较大。
    天津的这种做法，大可以推而广之。每个城市、每个地区、每个行业，都会有自己的薄弱环节，在技术革新运动中，都会有比较难攻的堡垒。对这些共同性的薄弱环节和技术革新课题，排一排队，把全市、全省、甚至全国的“同行”组织起来，千军万马，协力猛攻，胜利是一定会比孤军奋斗来得快，结果也一定会更加完美。
    去年，许多地区和产业部门依靠大协作的力量实现了生产的大跃进；今年，我们要继续发挥大协作的力量，来夺取技术革命的伟大胜利，以保证生产连续不断地跃进。
