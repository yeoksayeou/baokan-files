This newspaper reports:

    The Luomen Commune in Wushan County, Gansu Province, which first advocated "diverting water up the mountain," achieved a great victory in fully utilizing water energy and vigorously developing hydropower last year. The electrified new countryside that farmers have dreamed of for many years has begun to take shape here.
    More than 800 households in the Luomen Commune have installed electric lights. The Luomen Brigade has an average of 20 watts of electricity per person. The completed hydropower stations are scattered like gems embedded in the commune's 716 square kilometers, shining day and night. More hydropower stations are being built like mushrooms after rain on this happy land.
    The Luomen Commune has four major rivers: the Wei River, the Nan River, the Nie River, and the Xi River, as well as four canals that divert water up the mountain: the Dongliang, Zhongliang, Nanliang, and Xiaozhongliang, with an annual flow of 37 cubic meters per second. These are superior conditions for the large-scale development of rural hydropower stations and the rapid realization of rural electrification. In 1956, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Luomen diverted the water of the Dongliang Canal to a high mountain at an altitude of 1,900 meters, which not only eliminated drought but also established the first hydropower station. This not only brought electricity for lighting to the mountainous area but also built electric mills, electric water pumps, cotton gins, etc. (with a total annual industrial output value of 3.1 million yuan). In 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, the People's Commune was established, achieving a great leap forward and opening up a broader road for rural electrification. In 1959, with the great development of industrial and agricultural production, the enthusiasm of the masses for building power stations became higher and higher. When there was a lack of technical forces, they sent people out to learn; when there was a lack of machines, they imitated and made wooden turbines themselves. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Luomen Commune put forward the fighting slogan of "Start in one day, complete in ten days, generate electricity in half a month, and vow to win the first electrified commune in the province." It mobilized more than 10,000 laborers to dig foundations, fill earth, open canals, and transport stones day and night on the rivers and canals where stations could be built. By the end of last year, the commune had built a total of 14 small hydropower stations with an installed capacity of 670 kilowatts. Forty-seven power stations are under construction and are expected to be completed this spring. After completion, every village, team, and household will have electric lighting; much production will be able to be operated by electric power, completely realizing the electrification of power machinery.
    The Luomen Commune's power industry can develop at a high speed because, in addition to implementing the Party's General Line and the county committee's instructions on "water conservancy as the main priority, production as the main priority, small-scale as the main priority, and commune-run as the main priority," it mainly starts from the following points:
    1. Rely on the masses, self-reliance, make do with whatever is available, and manufacture equipment by ourselves. They used indigenous methods to manufacture double-impact turbines, modified motors to replace generators, used wooden water pipes to replace steel pipes, used wooden boards to replace iron sheets, and used iron sheets to replace silicon steel sheets.
    2. Give full play to the role of the "four craftsmen" (blacksmiths, stonemasons, carpenters, and masons), and train and expand the technical force in a short period of time through on-the-job training and the method of masters teaching apprentices.
    3. In terms of investment, the commune mainly invests, and at the same time, mobilizes the masses to invest and contribute materials. In terms of methods, take two steps. First, build a hydraulic power station with a small amount of investment and put it into production. After accumulating funds, install a generator and gradually expand and improve it to achieve "going foreign" from the local methods.
    4. Pay equal attention to construction and management, run stations frugally, build one station, and manage one station well. Take processing and production as the main priority, use the station to support the station, increase the accumulation of power stations, and then achieve the goal of using old stations to build new stations.

### 昔日引水上山　今日用水发电  洛门公社水电站星罗棋布

    昔日引水上山　今日用水发电
    洛门公社水电站星罗棋布
    本报讯　首倡“引水上山”的甘肃省武山县洛门公社，去年在充分利用水能、大办水电事业方面高奏凯歌，多少年来农民梦寐以求的电气化的新农村在这里已经初具规模。
    洛门公社已经有八百多户安装了电灯。洛门大队平均每人有电二十瓦；已经建成的水电站星罗棋布地像嵌在全公社七百十六平方公里面积上的宝石一样，日夜闪闪发光；而更多的正在加紧兴建的水电站像雨后春笋般朝新夕异地出现在这片幸福的土地上。
    洛门公社境内有渭河、南河、聂河和西河等四条较大的河流，又有东梁、中梁、南梁和小中梁四条引水上山的渠道，年流量为三十七秒公方。这是大规模发展农村水电站和高速度实现农村电气化的优越条件。1956年党领导洛门人民把东梁渠水引上海拔一千九百米的高山，不但消灭了干旱，并且建立了第一座水电站；不仅给山区带来了照明用电，同时也建起了电磨、电力抽水机、弹花机等（全年工业总产值达三百一十万元）。1958年在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，办起了人民公社，实现了大跃进，给农村电气化开辟了更为广阔的道路。在继续跃进的1959年，随着工农业生产的巨大发展，群众办电站的积极性越来越高了。没有技术力量，他们派人出去学；没有机器，就自己仿造木制水轮机。在党的八届八中全会以后，洛门公社提出“一天上马，十天建成，半月发电，誓夺全省第一个电气化公社”的战斗口号，出动了一万多名劳动力，在各个可以建站的河流和渠道上，夜以继日地挖基、填方、开渠、运石。到去年年底，全公社共建成小型水电站十四座，装机容量达六百七十瓦。正在施工的电站四十七座，估计可以在今年春天全部建成。建成后，村村队队、家家户户都有电灯照明；许多生产都能用电力操作，彻底实现动力机械电气化。
    洛门公社办电事业能高速度发展，除了贯彻执行党的总路线和县委关于“水利为主，生产为主，小型为主，社办为主”的指示外，主要是从以下几点着手：
    一、依靠群众，自力更生，因陋就简，自造设备。他们用土法制造两击式水轮机，用改装马达代替发机电，用木制水管代替钢管，用木板代替铁皮，用铁皮代替矽钢片。
    二、充分发挥“四匠”（铁匠、石匠、木匠、泥水匠）的作用，用阵地练兵，以师带徒的办法，在短期内培养和扩大了技术力量。
    三、投资方面，以社办为主，同时发动群众投资献材料。在方法上分两步走，先以少量投资建成水力动力站，投入生产，待积累资金后，再安装发电机，逐步扩大和提高，达到土里出洋。
    四、建管并重，勤俭办站，建成一站，管好一站。以加工生产为主，以站养站，增加电站积累，进而做到老站办新站。（附图片）
