	4. The Story of the Tunnels

	Little machinery was used to excavate the tunnels, and there were not many skilled workers either. Just like the folk song says, the enthusiasm of those migrant workers during the Great Leap Forward was enough to make mountains bow their heads. The technicians here are all battle-tested people, they can count countless projects, and they only have experience with success.
	The soul of imagination is courage. A cross-section of one hundred and eighty-four square meters is just a railway tunnel plus another railway tunnel, or maybe plus another... They had never used a twenty-cubic-meter air compressor before, but now they are using a forty-cubic-meter large air compressor. The hardness of the rock is comparable to that of the stone Buddha caves that are millions of years old, which is ideal for the designers. The excavators didn't object either, if the rock stumped them, what kind of excavators would they be!
	However, a pilot tunnel must be dug first. The pilot tunnel is equivalent to a foothold, or, in the words of the excavators, the working face. The pilot tunnel is in the upper part of the tunnel; with the pilot tunnel, it is easier to expand downwards and to both sides. Because it is from top to bottom, the arch lining saves a lot of wood for scaffolding. Most importantly, the pilot tunnel is like a ventilation pipe; what underground workers need is a ventilation pipe, and circulating air is the most basic condition. The pilot tunnel, what a good natural ventilation duct, and it will expand with the progress of the work until its diameter becomes the diameter of the entire tunnel.
	The excavators requested this: for this indispensable working condition, it is necessary to open it. The migrant workers also requested this, why not? For the New Year's Day gift, for the glory of the builders, they thought in their hearts, and also for the joy of going home for the festival.
	The initial tunneling speed was quite slow, and now that I think about it, it was even a bit ridiculous, but no athlete has ever laughed at their childhood walking posture. The daily excavation from three meters to ten meters and fifty centimeters is a gratifying growth.
	On December 30th, the workers in the five branch tunnels put down their hand drills, sledgehammers, and small dump trucks one after another; the tunnel was about to be completed. The person who went to the Provincial Party Committee to report the good news impatiently took a car to Xigu. Xigu has its own office, about half the distance from Lanzhou, and they were unwilling to waste the reporting time on the journey. This method is of course the best: as long as the person reporting the good news hears the cheers of the workers in the third branch tunnel raising their hands on the phone, they can shorten the time to the Provincial Party Committee gate by half.
	The sixth squad of the second detachment working in the third branch tunnel was also ready. They guaranteed to fire the last shot between six and eight o'clock. Upstream is the fourth branch tunnel, and downstream is the second branch tunnel. At that time, they should meet their comrades in the second and fourth branch tunnels underground.
	But after eight o'clock, the people in Xigu did not receive a call. Another hour passed, and there was still no news. The sixth squad also sent someone to report the good news. Someone asked the person from the sixth squad: "What kind of joke are you playing?" The person replied: "I guarantee that our rock excavators never joke. Besides that, I, like you, also don't know."
	These people who had never had an accident before did have a small accident. At eight o'clock, the third and fourth branch tunnels met, but the people in the second branch tunnel were still hiding behind the rocks. Later, it was discovered that there was still a thick wall between them. At that time, the sixth squad was struck more powerfully than by a cannonball. No one could say where they were? Where was the second branch tunnel? Human senses were powerless at that time. Even if the people from the second and third branch tunnels ran up and shook hands, they would still not know where the other was when they returned to the tunnel. The people in the pilot tunnel were arguing aimlessly. Good estimates and bad guesses each took the upper hand, because neither had any basis.
	The hope of opening the pilot tunnel at eight o'clock was dashed. The worst thing was the people waiting in Xigu. They were holding the good news report, unable to fill in the time, and even more unsure of what exactly happened in the pilot tunnel.
	Someone said: it went off course. If this estimate is correct, it is also the worst.
	Some people also felt that their ears vaguely heard the sound coming through the rock. But it was so weak and so easily disappeared. It was hidden in the sound of flowing water. It would also be buried by a pinch of sliding sand, so that it could prove nothing, just like a silkworm thread could not tie anything.
	Needless to say, mirrors and rulers were at work. The mirror confirmed that the station number position was correct, and then the result of measuring the station number with a tape measure was two meters more. This was the whole mistake made by that muddled technician.
	At this time, people also believed their ears. The sound that had previously been vaguely transmitted seemed to be getting louder, and even turned into a kind invitation. What does two meters matter? For the workers who created the high record, they could boldly say to the people waiting in Xigu: "Why not wait? It won't be long..."
	The pilot tunnel was finally opened. They cheered in the tunnel for a while and then came back, because the New Year's Day celebration was waiting for them.
	The migrant workers were naturally overjoyed, just as they had thought: I don't know if it's better to go home after the celebration or pack my luggage now?
	However, no one left.
	At the celebration, the Party Secretary found out about this, and he seemed to ask a certain migrant worker under the stage:
	"Are you planning to go home? In my opinion, it's not time yet," the secretary suddenly turned his head and glanced at the back of the stage, asking sternly: "Who said that we have finished? Comrades, I tell you, you have to wait..." He paused here, and no one knew why? Only his face slowly floated with a layer of smile, this smile they were familiar with and unfamiliar with, because behind this smile, they often heard some unexpected metaphors. At this time, the secretary actually raised his hand and pointed at the open-air stage and said: "Today we are just holding a small meeting, in the future we will also hold a big meeting, a meeting to celebrate the completion of the tunnel. At that time, we will not hold it here, we will hold it in the tunnel, and move this stage into the tunnel, and you will sit in the tunnel like today, understand? Not here. At that time, we..."
	The person being asked was stunned as if he was possessed, and couldn't help but say: "So big!"
	Everyone seemed to be the person being asked, and they all said the same thing:
	"Yes, it's still very big!"
	"Needless to say, don't go home without finishing the tunnel."
	An elderly person stood up and rebuked everyone: "Young men, quickly open your luggage. Do you think that if you pack your luggage, the Dragon King will be scared away? Our hammers are not hitting for nothing, if we want to hit, we have to hit out the second Yellow River."

    四、隧洞的故事
    开挖隧洞很少机械，连技工也不多。正像民歌说的，那些做为大跃进时代的民工，他们的热情足以叫高山低头。这里的技工，可都是久经战斗的人，他们数得出无数的工程，只是没有失败的经验。
    幻想的灵魂是勇气。一百八十四平方米的断面，不过是一个铁路隧洞加上一个铁路隧洞，或者再加上一个……。他们从前也没用过二十方的空压机，现在也用起四十方的大空压机了。岩石的硬度，抵得上千万年的石佛窟，对设计者来说这是最理想的了。开挖工也不表示反对，如果岩石难倒了他们，又算是什么开挖工呢！
    但是，必须先打通一条导坑。导坑等于立足点，用开挖工人的话来说，就是工作面。导坑是在隧洞上部，有了导坑才好向下，向两侧扩展。因为是从上向下，拱顶衬砌之后也就省去不少木材来做撑架了。最重要的还是，导坑等于一条通风管，地下工人需要的就是通风管，流通的空气是最基本的条件。导坑，这是多么好的一条自然的通风管道，而且它将随着工作进度而扩大，一直到它的直径变成整个隧洞的直径。
    开挖工人这样要求着：为了这个必不可少的工作条件，必需打通它。民工也这样要求着，为什么不呢？为了元旦献礼，为了建设者的光荣，他们在心里想，也为了回家过节的喜悦。
    开始掘进的速度相当不快，现在想起来，甚至有些可笑，不过，没有一个运动健将曾经笑过自己童年学步的姿态。日掘进由三米到十米零五十，是个可喜的成长。
    12月30日那一天，五个支洞里的工人，先后放下了他们的手钎、大锤和小斗车，隧洞就要打通了。到省委报喜的人，急不可耐地乘汽车到西固去了。西固有自己的办事处，距兰州近一半，他们不肯把报喜的时间浪费在路程上。这个办法当然最好：只要报喜的人在电话里听见三支洞的工人举起双手的欢呼，他们就可以缩短一半的时间来到省委门口。
    在三支洞工作的二中队六分队，也已万事就绪，他们保证六点到八点放最后一炮。上游是四支洞，下游是二支洞，那时他们就该和二四支洞的战友，在地下会师了。
    但是过了八点，西固的人没有接到电话。又过了一小时，仍然没有消息。六分队也派去了报喜的人，有人对六分队的人问道：“你们开的什么玩笑呀？”这人回答道：“我保证咱们开挖石头的人，从来不开玩笑。别的，我和你一样，也是不知道。”
    这些从来没有出事故的人，的确出了点小小事故。八点钟三支洞和四支洞会合了，可是，二支洞的人们仍然躲在岩石后面。后来才知道他们之间还隔着一座厚墙。当时，六分队受的震击，比炮弹还厉害，没有一个人说得出他们在哪里？二支洞又在哪里？人的感觉，那时是无能为力的。即使二支洞和三支洞的人跑上来握了手，他们再回到洞里仍然不知道对方在什么地方。导坑里的人没头没脑地争论着。好的估计和坏的猜疑，各占上风，因为都没有根据。
    八点钟打通导坑的希望落空了，最糟的是等在西固的人，他们手里拿着喜报，填不上时间，更不知道导坑里究竟发生了什么事故。
    有人说：打偏了。如果这个估计是正确的，也就是最坏的。
    也有人觉得自己的耳朵，隐约听出了隔着岩石传过来的声音。只是它是那么微弱，又是那样容易消失。它隐藏在流水的声音之中。它又会为一撮溜下的砂土所湮没，以致它什么也不能证明，就像一根蚕丝系不起任何东西一样。
    不用说，镜子和尺在工作了。镜子证实了桩号位置正确，再由桩号用皮尺测量的结果，多出了二米。这就是那个糊涂的技术员所造成的全部错误。
    这时，人们也相信自己的耳朵了。从前隐约传过来的声音，似乎大起来了，甚至变成了亲切的召唤。二米有什么关系，对于创造了高纪录的工人来说，他们可以放开胆子对等在西固的人说道：“为什么不等着？等不了好久的……。”
    导坑终于打通了。他们在洞子里欢呼了一阵就回来了，因为元旦的庆祝会在等待他们。
    民工们自然也欢喜万分，正像他们曾经想的：不知道开了庆祝会回家好，还是现在就卷行李？
    不过，谁也没有走成。
    在庆祝会上，书记同志知道了这件事，他好像对着台下的某一个民工这样问道：
    “是你准备回家吗？依我说还不到时候，”书记忽然回头向台后望了一眼，严厉地问道：“这是谁说的我们已经完工了？同志们，我对你们说，还得等等……”他说到这里停住了，谁也不知道为了什么？只见他脸上慢慢浮上了一层笑容，这笑容他们又熟悉而又不熟悉，因为他们在这笑容后面，常常听到一些意想不到的比喻。这时，书记果然举起手来指着露天舞台说：“今天我们只是开一个小会，将来我们还要开大会，庆祝隧洞完工的大会。那时我们不在这里开了，我们要在隧洞里开，要把这个舞台搬到隧洞里，你们也像今天一样坐在隧洞里，知道吗？不是在这里。到那个时候，咱们……”
    被问的人，仿佛着了魔似地惊呆了，不由得呐呐地说：“那么大啊！”
    每个人仿佛都是被问的人，也都说出了同样的话：
    “是啊，还大得很哩！”
    “那还用说，不打完隧洞不回家。”
    一个上了年纪的人，站起来对大家责备地说：“小伙子，快把行李打开。你以为你一卷行李，龙王爷就吓跑了吗？我们的锤子不是白敲的，要敲就得敲出第二条黄河来。”
