    Two Kinds of Feelings
    Liu Qian
    Recently, I took a quick tour of Xuyi in northern Jiangsu, a place known for raising oxen. When I entered a cowshed in the Longshan Commune, the keeper was warming the cattle by a fire. The room was steamy, warm as spring, clean and dry throughout, with not a trace of a foul odor. Old Han, the keeper, said it well: "Cattle are like adopted sons for old age, so draft cattle must be well cared for." Yue Guangquan, a skilled cattle breeder in his fifties, fed the small calves thin porridge because they had no milk to drink, and even caught crabs for the postpartum cows to eat. The commune members also cherish the cattle, using them on time, resting them on time, feeding them on time, and watering them on time, without overworking them.
    I met many draft cattle keepers who loved cattle as much as their own lives. They could understand the needs of the cattle from their sounds and movements, whether they needed to urinate, eat, were afraid of the cold, or felt hot. They said: Cattle cannot speak, so you have to observe carefully. It is a remarkable thing that many keepers can love the collectively owned cattle so much. This shows that the people's communes have played a significant role in cultivating the spirit of collectivism. Some people say that only private ownership can increase people's feelings for material wealth, which is truly judging the heart of a gentleman with the mind of a petty person.
    Before liberation, the vast number of peasants had no land to stand on, let alone cattle. They experienced the pain of pulling plows themselves, and it was common for land to be left uncultivated due to lack of oxen. After the land reform, they also pursued the life of "thirty mu of land and an ox," but still did not break out of the circle of private ownership. Under the correct leadership and education of the Party, through mutual aid teams, elementary cooperatives, and advanced cooperatives, they gradually embarked on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, and successfully transformed individual ownership, realizing the socialist collective ownership of major means of production such as land, livestock, and large farm implements. This gradually established the idea of collective ownership among the vast number of peasants. After the rural people's communes were established in 1958, more collective and socialist ideas were established in this new social organization. They realized that in order to completely change the "poverty and blankness" and to further develop production and carry out diversified operations, it was very necessary to gradually change the means of production from private ownership to collective ownership.
    Therefore, the peasants' feelings for cattle have undergone a fundamental change, which is a feeling for collective ownership and collective undertakings. This is different from the feeling of "thirty mu of land and an ox" at that time. The broad masses of peasants have abandoned the old ideas and views of only caring about themselves and not the collective, only caring about the present and not the future. Under the leadership of the Party, they have resolutely embarked on the road to the communist paradise of collective ownership and collective production.
    Similarly, there are feelings for cattle, but these two kinds of feelings have nothing in common. The feelings of rich middle peasants for cattle are private, while the broad masses of commune members love cattle meticulously, recognizing that the feeding and use of cattle is a collective feeling. The commune members realize that raising cattle well and raising more cattle can improve the level of cultivation, produce more grain, greatly save manpower, and reduce the physical labor of the commune members. At the same time, selling calves to support other communes can also increase the economic income of the commune members, accumulating funds for the gradual realization of mechanization. Some communes in Xuyi County are preparing to use this money to order tractors and water pumps from the supply and marketing cooperatives. Cadres and the masses happily said: "Beef cattle turn into tractors, old cattle turn into living machines." Their eyes are not only focused on the cattle, but also on the mechanization of the commune, and the beautiful prospect of iron oxen replacing cattle. Can't we also see the spirit of collectivism growing rapidly with the development of the commune from these two sentences?

    两种感情
    刘浅
    最近我在以饲养耕牛著称的苏北盱眙走马看花一趟，我走进龙山公社的一所牛舍时，饲养员正在替牛烤火，屋内热气腾腾，温暖如春，满舍清洁干燥，一点臊臭味也没有。饲养员韩老头说的好：“牛是人的养老儿子，耕牛要好好保养。”五十多岁的养牛能手岳光全因小奶牛没奶吃，他就用稀粥来喂小牛，对产后的母牛，还去摸螃蟹给牛吃。社员也能爱惜用牛，做到按时用，按时休息，按时喂养，按时饮水，不使耕牛过度劳累。
    我会到好多耕牛饲养员，都是爱牛如命，他们能从牛的声音和动作中体会到牛的要求，是要尿、是要吃、还是怕冷、受热。他们说：牛是不会说话的，要仔细观察才行。许多饲养员都能如此热爱集体所有的耕牛，这是一件很了不起的事，这说明人民公社在培养集体主义精神上已起了不小的作用。有人说：只有私有才能增加人们对于物质财富的感情，那真是以小人之心，度君子之腹了。
    在解放前，广大农民贫无立锥之地，当然更没有耕牛，他们备尝了人拉犁的痛苦，地无牛耕，白白荒掉的情形也常见。土地改革后，他们也曾追求过“三十亩地，一头牛”的生活，仍然没有跳出私有的圈子。在党的正确领导和教育下，经过互助组、初级社、高级社，他们逐步走上了互助合作的道路，胜利地改造了个体所有制，实现了土地、牲畜、大农具等主要生产资料的社会主义集体所有制。使广大农民逐步建立了集体所有制的思想。1958年农村人民公社化后，在这新的社会组织里，就建立了更多的集体主义思想和社会主义思想。他们认识到为了彻底改变“一穷二白”的面貌，为更大地发展生产和开展多种经营，逐步将生产资料由私有制改变为集体所有制是非常必要的。
    于是，农民对牛的感情，就起了根本性的变化，这就是对集体所有制、对集体事业的感情。这已不同于“三十亩地，一头牛”那时的感情了。广大的农民群众已经丢开了那种只顾自己不顾集体、只顾眼前、不顾将来的旧思想、旧观点。他们在党的领导下，坚决走上了通往共产主义乐园的集体所有制和集体生产的道路。
    同样是对耕牛有感情，可是这两种感情就毫无共同之点，富裕中农对耕牛是私有的感情，而广大社员无微不至地热爱耕牛，认识到对耕牛的饲养和使用，是集体所有的感情。社员认识到养好耕牛、多养耕牛可以提高耕作水平，多打粮食，大大节省了人力，减轻了社员的体力劳动。同时卖掉牛犊，支援其他公社，也可增加社员经济收入，为逐步实现机械化积累了资金。盱眙县的一些公社准备用这些钱向供销社定购拖拉机和抽水机。干部和群众都愉快地说：“肉牛变成拖拉机，老牛变成活机器。”他们的目光并不光停留在耕牛身上，也看到了公社的机械化，看到了铁牛代替耕牛的美好远景。我们从这两句话里，不是也可以看到集体主义精神正在随着公社的发展而迅速增长吗？
