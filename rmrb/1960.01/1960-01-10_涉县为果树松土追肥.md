    She County Loosens Soil and Applies Fertilizer to Fruit Trees
    (Our Dispatch) To strive for an even greater fruit harvest in 1960, the communes in She County, Hebei Province, have launched winter management work in their orchards. Fruit products are an important source of income for the vast majority of people in this county. The county achieved another bumper fruit harvest in 1959, with fruit production accounting for more than 11% of the total agricultural income. In many communes with concentrated fruit tree areas, fruit income generally accounts for more than half.
    During the winter before last and last spring, the communes in She County carried out a series of tasks in orchard management, including digging tree pits for more than 1.18 million trees and fertilizing 1.08 million trees. At the same time, a large number of fruit trees were watered, whitewashed, and pruned. The bumper fruit harvest in the county in 1959 was achieved on the basis of this meticulous management.
    Based on the experience of last year's fruit harvest, the county has formulated a plan to dig tree pits for 3 million trees and apply topdressing fertilizer to 2 million trees during the winter and spring, and to irrigate where water conservancy conditions permit. The Huoshui Commune, with the cooperation of more than 2,100 professional team members, mobilized the masses to blitz clean the orchards for five days. Many units achieved "three cleans" (clean trees, clean under the trees, clean surroundings) and "four clears" (picking up all diseased and insect-infested fallen fruits, cutting off diseased and insect-infested branches, sweeping up fallen leaves, and removing weeds) in the orchard cleaning.

    涉县为果树松土追肥
    本报讯　河北省涉县各公社为了争取1960年果品更大丰收，开展了果园的冬季管理工作。果树产品是这个县广大群众的重要收入。全县1959年果品又获得丰收，果产收入占农业总收入的11％还多。许多果树集中地区的公社，果树收入一般占到半数以上。
    前年冬天和去年春天，涉县各公社在果园管理上进行了一系列的工作，先后共刨树坪一百一十八万多株、施肥一百零八万株，同时还有大量的果树灌了水、涂了白和修了枝。1959年这个县果品丰收，就是在这种细致地管理基础上获得的。
    这个县根据去年果树丰收的经验，制定冬春刨树坪三百万株，施追肥二百万株，有水利条件都灌水的计划。活水公社在二千一百多名专业队配合下，发动群众突击清理果园五天。许多单位在清理果园中做到了“三净”（树上净、树下净、周围净），“四光”（病虫落果拾光、病虫枝剪光、落叶扫光、杂草除光）。　　　（甄学之）（附图片）
