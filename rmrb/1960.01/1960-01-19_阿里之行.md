    A Trip to Ali
    Ren Chen

    Recently, I had the opportunity to take a trip to the beautiful northern Tibetan Plateau—the Ali region. This was truly a long journey that one will always cherish.
    Ali is surrounded by layers of high mountains. For thousands of years, the only means of transportation for the Tibetan compatriots living here was the yak and pack sheep. Now, the situation is very different. You can take a car from Yecheng in Xinjiang directly to the main towns of Ali: Rutog Dzong, Gar Tagh, and Purang Dzong. As you drive through steep valleys, across snow-covered slopes, or over vast grasslands, you can see the marching slogans left by the troops who entered Tibet in 1950; you can see the heroic vows left by the "Xinjiang-Tibet Highway" survey team in 1951; you can see the glorious messages left by the road-building heroes a few years ago. Naturally, these heroic verses are not written on paper, but are deeply carved into the stone cliffs with pickaxes, or inlaid into the road surface with colorful pebbles. My travel companions and I recited these verses again and again. In my eyes, every word is a flower. These brilliant and dazzling flowers adorn the plateau beautifully. Whether it was the PLA soldiers or the heroic soldiers and laborers building the road, they all defied hardships, declared war on the high mountains, fought against floods, overcame all kinds of unimaginable difficulties, and built the "Xinjiang-Tibet Highway" alongside the Tibetan compatriots. They watered the roadbed with their own sweat. Today, convoys of cars travel back and forth along this road, bringing tea, cloth, daily necessities, seeds, machines, and newspapers to the people of Ali. ... The days when Tibetan compatriots could only travel five to ten kilometers a day with yaks and pack sheep are over. They can load their mountain products onto trucks for transportation, they can sit in cars, singing songs as they cross high mountains and rivers, go to the interior to study and visit, and go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao.

    Ali is backed by the "Ancestor of Ten Thousand Mountains," the Kunlun Mountains, and leans against the "Roof of the World," the Himalayas. This plateau, however, is also a continuous range of mountains, layered upon layered, like rolling waves. The mountain tops have primitive snow that does not melt all year round, while below the snow line, there are fields of cottongrass and patches of wildflowers everywhere. The world-renowned Mount Kailash is distributed among the mountain ranges.
    Often, when the car comes out of the valley, a vast golden grassland suddenly unfolds before your eyes, and then the clear and melodious mountain songs of the herdsmen come. Look! The sheep are moving slowly, like floating white clouds falling on the grassland. At the same time, with the roar of the engine, you can also see muskrats and mountain rabbits fleeing. But herds of wild sheep, wild cattle, and wild donkeys don't care much, they look up, and then continue to graze, or stroll around.

    On the plateau, lakes are scattered like stars. We drove along the lakes, feeling particularly comfortable. The azure water, rippling with waves, lapped against the shore, wild ducks took flight on the water, and schools of fish swam in the water. These lakes, connected by rivers of all sizes, are like strings of pearls, forming a natural water conservancy network.

    This is just what can be seen along the way; as for the various mineral deposits buried underground, they are also very rich. Some mineral veins are exposed on the ground in large patches, as if they are waiting to be developed and are already a little impatient.

    Since ancient times, no vegetables have grown on the Ali Plateau. But the frontier soldiers stationed in Ali have created a miracle on this "Roof of the World." When you see the rows upon rows of green vegetable fields, you will forget that you are on a plateau more than four thousand meters above sea level. We took a curious approach, randomly picked a few vegetables in the vegetable garden of a certain unit, and weighed them. The large cabbages each weighed more than eighteen pounds; the large radishes weighed more than seven pounds; the large turnips weighed more than eight pounds; and the potatoes in one nest weighed five pounds and seven ounces. This shows that the vegetable harvest here is no less than that of any fertile plain. This unit has now basically achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables. This has not only improved the lives of the troops and reduced the burden on the country, but more importantly, it has played an exemplary role in the development of agriculture for the people of Ali. Therefore, it has won unanimous praise from the people of Ali.

    The border guards stationed in Ali love the magnificent and rich Ali Plateau as much as they love their hometowns; they have established a bond of flesh and blood with the simple and hardworking Tibetan compatriots, just as they would treat their parents, siblings. All year round, they live in deep mountains and valleys, live in the scorching sun and cold wind, but they live so carefree, with songs and laughter all day long. Some of the veteran soldiers of this border defense army have been serving for a year beyond their term of service, and are still writing applications, requesting to continue serving in the team, or to transfer to the Ali region to engage in production, and assist the Tibetan compatriots in jointly developing production and construction on the plateau. They have dedicated their fiery hearts to the magnificent plateau of the motherland.

    阿里之行
    任晨
    最近，我有机会到美丽的藏北高原——阿里地区走了一趟，这实在是一次使人永远怀恋的长途旅行。
    阿里是被层层高山所环抱着的。居住在这儿的藏族同胞，千百年来唯一的交通工具就是牦牛和驮羊。现在情况可就大不相同了。你可以从新疆叶城坐上汽车，直去阿里的主要城镇日土宗、噶大克、普兰宗。当你乘车穿过险峻的山谷，越过积雪的大坡，或是驰过辽阔的草原时，你可以看见1950年进藏部队所留下的行军标语；可以看见“新藏公路”勘察队员们在1951年所留下的豪迈誓语；可以看见几年以前筑路健儿们的光荣留言。自然，这些英雄的诗句，不是写在纸上的，而是用十字镐深深雕刻在石崖上，或是用五花石子嵌砌在路面上的。我和我的旅伴们，一遍又一遍地诵读着这些诗句，在我看来，每一个字都是一朵花。这灿烂夺目的花，把高原点缀得十分美丽。无论是解放军战士或筑路的英雄士兵和民工，他们都曾不辞千辛万苦，向高山宣战，跟洪水搏斗，克服了种种难以想像的困难，和藏族同胞并肩修筑“新藏公路”，他们用自己的汗水浇灌了路基。如今，成队的汽车沿着这条路在往返奔驰，给阿里人民送来茶叶、布匹、日用品，运来了种籽、机器、书报。……藏族同胞以牦牛驮羊每日只能走五至十公里的驮运生活结束了，他们可以把山货装车外运，他们可以坐在车上，唱着歌越过高山、飞过大河，到内地学习、参观，到北京去见毛主席。
    阿里北靠“万山之祖”昆仑山，南依“世界屋脊”喜马拉雅山。而这高原上，却又是群山绵延，层层叠叠，好似起伏的海浪。山顶上有终年不化的原始积雪，而雪线以下却是绒草遍野、野花片片。世界驰名的冈底斯山就分布在群岭之中。
    往往当汽车穿出山谷的时候，眼前会豁然展开一望无垠的金色的草原，接着，牧人们清脆悦耳的山歌就传来了。你看吧！羊群在慢慢移动，像是浮动的白云落到草地上了。同时，随着马达的轰响，你还可以看见麝鼠、山兔在逃奔。而成群的野羊、野牛、野驴却不大在乎，仰头望望，然后依旧吃草，或是漫步。
    高原上，海子星罗棋布。我们乘车沿着海子行驶，心里格外舒畅。蔚蓝的海水，微波荡漾，一浪一浪拍击着海岸，水上野鸭扑飞，水中鱼群游荡。这些海子，通过大小河流连接起来，宛如一串串珍珠，形成了天然的水利网。
    这只是沿途可以看见的，至于埋在地下的各种矿藏，也非常丰富。有的矿苗就大片大片露出地面，好像它们在等待开发，已经有些性急了。
    从古以来，阿里高原上没有生长过蔬菜。而驻防阿里的边疆战士们，却在这世界屋脊上创造了奇迹。当你看到那一畦连一畦的绿油油的菜地时，你就会忘记自己是在海拔四千多米的高原上。我们曾以好奇的心情，在某部队的菜地随便找了几棵菜，称了称，白菜大的每棵在十八斤以上；萝卜大的有七斤多；蔓菁大的有八斤多；洋芋一窝有五斤七两。足见这儿的蔬菜收获量并不次于任何肥沃的平原。这支部队目前已基本上作到了蔬菜自给。这样，不但改善了部队生活，减轻了国家的负担；更重要的是为阿里人民发展农业起了示范带头作用。因而获得了阿里人民异口同声的赞扬。
    驻守阿里的边防战士们像热爱自己的家乡一样，热爱着壮丽富饶的阿里高原；他们像对自己的父母姐弟一样，和纯朴勤劳的藏族同胞建立了骨肉之情。一年四季，他们生活在深山峻岭中，生活在烈日寒风下，然而他们却过得那样无忧无虑，整日有歌有笑。这支边防军的一些老战士，已经超期服役一年了，还在纷纷写申请书，要求继续留队服役，或者转业在阿里地区从事生产，协助藏族同胞共同发展高原上的生产建设。他们把自己的一颗火热的心，献给了祖国壮丽的高原。
