    Miscellaneous Thoughts on Quyi Music
    —Listening to the Report Performance of Excellent Quyi Programs
  　Li Ling
    Since the 1958 performance, Quyi art has undergone significant development. First, it has achieved many new gains in singing about new construction and struggle life, serving socialism, and exploring and creating these new themes in terms of techniques and styles. For example, "Xu Xuehui," sung by Liang Xiaolou, expresses the spirit of defending national property and vowing to resist the enemy to the death; "Double Nest Cart" by Ma Zenghui depicts the struggle between the advanced and the conservative; the Shanghai group singing of "Xiang Xiuli"; the Sichuan Qingyin "Jiang Zhuyun," sung by Deng Bixia, sings about the heroic sacrifice of revolutionary martyrs; and "Watching Fireworks" by Wang Yubao sings about the victory of the Great Leap Forward through the grandmother and granddaughter watching fireworks. The music of these new programs vividly and profoundly expresses new heroic figures and deeds.
    From the perspective of Quyi form, it is not without difficulties to express the new struggle life; some programs have good meaning, but when only one or two people rely on storytelling and singing to depict them, the image is not easy to highlight. If many words and sentences are handled according to the previous singing style, they often lack good results, which cannot but prompt many of our experienced artists to make some new attempts on the inherent tunes. For example, in Liang Xiaolou's "Xu Xuehui," there are many sentences that were originally sung separately, but she connected them and made new arrangements, which made the meaning of the words more coherent and complete.
    Originally, storytelling and singing art is mostly "pursuing tunes according to words" for easy understanding when singing. However, many static sentences often have tail-end tunes that fall on descending melodic patterns. Like the four words "splendid and brilliant" in "the people's capital is splendid and brilliant" in "Xu Xuehui," and the later "city full of joy," it is difficult to depict vividly if developed downwards according to the original tune. In order to avoid "harming the words with the tune" and restricting the content due to the form, the actor made new arrangements for these tunes; the singing style was changed to be broad and sonorous, with necessary extensions and pauses, which greatly increased its appeal.
    It is necessary to inherit and develop, and development is to enable the traditional art form to better express new things and new emotions. Many inherent tunes have their advantages, but they also have certain limitations. This time, the singing style of some actors contradicted the content, and some important sentences were sung in a low and weak tone due to the tune, which made it difficult to achieve good results.
    This report performance saw the emergence of many new talents. These young actors all have a good foundation in terms of sound quality. Some of them have beautiful sound quality and very clear pronunciation. The first few sentences quickly captivated the audience, but in the middle, they seemed flat. This is probably due to insufficient attention to the hierarchical arrangement of the entire passage, the artistic analysis of the ups and downs, fast, slow, loose, tight... of each section.
    A beautiful voice is very important, but it must be carefully studied and made excellent arrangements to be moving. Some people's voices are not necessarily particularly loud or full, but they can achieve deep effects through careful carving. This requires more understanding of the content and making more efforts to learn from the predecessors.
    The band accompaniment is of great assistance to the singer. Sun Shuyun's singing is stable and affectionate. Her stage style is relatively subtle, and she pays great attention to the singing of words and sentences. In describing Xiang Xiuli's heroic sacrifice to protect national property, it is very prominent. Xiang Xiuli's love for the Party at the time of her death, and her mother's care for her children, are deep and affectionate. In these places, the accompaniment played a huge supporting role.
    As for some programs of Sichuan Qingyin, the band is light, clear, soft, and beautiful, and the sound is also very accurate. It is truly "when singing to the deep emotion in the tune, every tap and press is doubly moving."

    曲艺音乐杂谈
    ——听曲艺优秀节目汇报演出
  　李凌
    曲艺艺术，从1958年会演以来，有着显著的发展。首先是，它在歌唱新的建设和斗争生活、为社会主义服务以及探索和创造这些新的题材的手法、风格方面，有着许多新的收获。像良小楼演唱的表现保卫国家财产、誓死却敌精神的“徐学惠”，马增蕙的刻划先进和保守斗争的“双窝车”，上海群唱的“向秀丽”，邓碧霞歌唱革命烈士英勇就义的四川清音“江竹筠”，王毓宝的通过婆婆孙女看焰火来歌唱大跃进胜利的“看焰火”。这些新的节目的音乐，都生动而又深刻地表现了新的英雄人物和事迹。
    从曲艺形式来说，要表现新的斗争生活，不是没有困难的；有些节目，意义很好，但只用一人或两人单靠说唱来描绘时，形象就不易突出。有许多词句，如果按照以往的行腔处理，往往缺乏良好的效果，这就不能不促使我们许多有经验的艺人，在固有的腔调上作一些新的尝试。像良小楼演唱的“徐学惠”中，有许多原来是分开来唱的句子，她把它连贯起来作了新的处理，这样就使词意更加连贯而完整。
    本来，说唱艺术多半是“追字求腔”，歌唱起来才易于了解。然而有许多静止句，尾腔常常是落在下行的音型上。像“徐学惠”中的“人民首都灿烂辉煌”的“灿烂辉煌”四字，以及后面的“满城欢乐”等，按照原有的腔调往下发展，就很难描绘得有声有色。演员为了不致“以调害词”，使内容受到形式的限制，她把这几句腔调，作了新的安排；走腔改为宽阔高亢，并有必要的延伸和顿挫，这就大大地增加了它的感染力。
    要承继，更要发展，发展是为了使传统的艺术形式，更好地表现新的事物和新的情感。许多固有的曲牌，有它的优点，也有一定的局限性。这次有的演员的唱腔因为和内容有矛盾，有些重要的语句由于腔调的关系唱得低沉而缺乏力量，便不容易取得效果。
    这次汇报演出，出现了许多新的人才。这些年青的演员，在声音本质上，都具有较好基础。他们中间有些音质是优美的，字音也很清晰，最初几句，很快就把观众迷住了，但到中途，却显得平板，这恐怕是对整个段子的层次安排，每节的抑扬顿挫、快、慢、松、紧……等艺术分析注意得不够。
    优美的歌喉非常重要，但必需加以慎密的研究，作出出色的安排，才能动人肺腑，有的人声音并不见得特别宏亮、丰美，由于细致雕刻就能取得很深的效果。这就不能不对内容多多体会，悉力向前辈作更多的学习。
    乐队伴奏，对演唱者的协助是很大的。孙书筠的演唱，稳定、深情，她的台式比较含蓄，对字句的行腔也很注意。在描写向秀丽英勇地为保护国家财产而不惜牺牲时，非常突出，向秀丽临终时，对党的热爱，以及她母亲对儿女的关怀，情深而亲切。在这些地方，伴奏起了极大的烘托作用。
    余如四川清音的一些节目，乐队轻清柔美，声音也非常准确，真是“唱到曲中深情处，一扣一压倍动人。”
