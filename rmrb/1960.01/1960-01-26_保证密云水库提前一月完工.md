To the Editor:

The great news of completing the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule has greatly encouraged us. All the builders at the construction site are determined to continue holding high the red flag of the General Line and strive for even greater victories.

The Miyun Reservoir, a large-scale water conservancy project that began storing water in the same year it started, was constructed during the Great Leap Forward of the national economy in 1959. Under the wise leadership of the Party, the members of more than one hundred people's communes in Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality fought hard for more than a year, completing more than 80% of the total earthwork of the entire project at an unprecedented speed. Since the commencement of our construction site, we have been advancing at high speed, following the Party's General Line and taking the steps of the Great Leap Forward. The fact that the famous "Lively and Vigorous Shock Brigade" on our construction site completed forty months of work in eleven months is the best proof.

After the victorious flood control, we did not slacken our efforts in the slightest. In the spirit of continuous revolution, we continued to embark on new battles. Even though the labor force at our construction site has been reduced by more than half since the flood control, not only has the efficiency of dam filling been increasing day by day, but we have also extracted manpower and material resources to start the construction of the Qingshiling Hydropower Station upstream of the reservoir. We believe that in the new year, the national construction will achieve even more brilliant achievements. The builders of our reservoir must also make more outstanding achievements than in 1959 and ensure that all engineering tasks are completed one month ahead of schedule before this year's flood season.

    保证密云水库提前一月完工编辑同志：
    提前三年完成第二个五年计划主要的消息大大鼓舞了我们，全工地的建设者决心继续高举总路线的红旗，争取更大的胜利。
    动工一年就拦洪蓄水的大型水利工程——密云水库，就是在1959年国民经济大跃进中建设的。在党的英明领导下，河北省和北京市一百多个人民公社的社员奋战一年多，以空前的速度完成了全部工程总土方量的80％以上。我们工地自开工以来，一直是按照党的总路线，迈着大跃进的步伐，高速度前进的。工地上著名的生龙活虎突击队，用十一个月时间完成四十个月任务的事实就是最好的证明。
    在胜利拦洪以后，我们丝毫没有松劲。我们本着不断革命的精神，继续开始了新的战斗。我们工地在拦洪后劳动力减少一多半的情况下，不但坝身填筑工效日益提高，还抽出人力、物力在水库上游动工修建青石岭水电站。我们相信，在新的一年里，国家建设将会取得更加辉煌的成就。我们水库的建设者也要作出比1959年更出色的成绩，保证在今年汛期以前，比原计划提前一个月完成全部工程任务。
                密云水库全体建设者
