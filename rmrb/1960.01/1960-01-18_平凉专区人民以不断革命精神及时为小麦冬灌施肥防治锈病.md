    The people of Pingliang Special District, which accounts for one-half of Gansu Province's winter wheat sown area, have entered a high tide of winter wheat management. Thanks to the full utilization of the superiority of the People's Communes, Pingliang Special District did a good job of planting and meticulously managing wheat last winter. Consequently, the wheat seedlings are strong and green in color. According to recent inspections in various counties, third-class seedlings account for only 3.6% of the total wheat field area in the entire district. Therefore, some commune cadres and members have neglected wheat field management. The Party committees at all levels promptly organized the vast number of commune members to conduct a major debate on how to ensure a bumper wheat harvest this year, criticizing blindly optimistic sentiments. Currently, 250,000 people in the entire district have been投入了into wheat field management.
    After the debate, the communes in the suburbs of Pingliang City organized 170 specialized winter irrigation teams, which have already irrigated 143,000 mu of wheat. During winter irrigation, experienced farmers and technicians worked closely together, researched each other, and achieved economical water use. Currently, more than 4.6 million mu of wheat in the entire special district have been fertilized with warm seedling fertilizer, averaging 7,100 jin per mu, and more than 2.3 million mu of wheat have been winter irrigated. In conjunction with fertilization and irrigation, various regions have also focused on field seedling protection management. In areas where rust has occurred, the local Party committees mobilized the masses to promptly investigate and prevent it. Currently, more than 2 million mu of wheat have been treated, basically controlling the spread of rust.

    平凉专区人民以不断革命精神及时为小麦冬灌施肥防治锈病
    本报讯　占甘肃省冬小麦播种面积二分之一的平凉专区，小麦越冬管理工作已进入高潮。由于充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，平凉专区去冬小麦种的好、管的细，因而麦苗健壮，色泽碧绿。据最近各县检查，全区五百七十二万亩小麦，三类苗仅占总麦田面积的3．6％。因此，部分社干部、社员有忽视麦田管理现象。各级党委及时组织广大社员开展了如何保证今年小麦大丰收的大辩论，批判了盲目乐观情绪。目前全区已有二十五万人投入了麦田管理工作。
    平凉市郊各公社在辩论以后，组织了一百七十个冬灌专业队，已灌小麦十四万三千多亩。在冬灌中，老农、技术员紧密结合，互相研究，作到了经济用水。目前，全专区已有四百六十多万亩小麦施上了暖苗肥，每亩平均七千一百斤，冬灌小麦二百三十多万亩。结合施肥、灌水，各地区还大抓田间保苗管理工作。在发生锈病地方，当地党委发动群众，及时侦查，及时防治。现已防治小麦二百多万亩，基本上控制了锈病的蔓延。
