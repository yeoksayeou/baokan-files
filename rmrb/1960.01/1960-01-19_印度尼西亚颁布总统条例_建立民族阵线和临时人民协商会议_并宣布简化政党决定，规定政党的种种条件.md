    印度尼西亚颁布总统条例
    建立民族阵线和临时人民协商会议
    并宣布简化政党决定，规定政党的种种条件
    据新华社雅加达电　此间12日晚公布了关于建立民族阵线和临时人民协商会议的组成的两项总统条例，并且宣布了关于简化政党的总统决定。
    根据建立民族阵线的总统条例规定，民族阵线的宗旨是完成民族革命、为建立一个公正和繁荣的社会而进行全面发展和建设以及收复西伊里安。
    这项条例规定，民族阵线的任务是“同政府和其它国家机构密切合作”，“团结社会上一切革命力量，来领导有关各种建设、社会福利、治安和国防方面的社会运动。”
    根据这项条例，总统将担任民族阵线总务委员会主席。条例还规定，凡是印度尼西亚公民，不论他是否已经加入其它政治组织和专业团体，都可以加入民族阵线。
    根据印度尼西亚的现行宪法，人民协商会议将成为印度尼西亚的最高权力机关。它将包括总数在两百五十人以上的全体国会议员以及两百九十四名专业团体和来自各地区的代表。国会将继续存在，它的权力将大大削减。
    根据关于临时人民协商会议的组成的总统条例，专业团体的代表总共为两百人，各地区的代表总共为九十四人，在两百名专业团体的代表中，有四十五人来自武装部队，五人来自退伍军人，四十人来自农民，四十人来自工人和职员。
    根据这项条例，总统将从地方议会和专业团体指定的候选人名单中，选择和任命临时人民协商会议的代表。临时人民协商会议的任期最多是三年。
  以“政党的条件和简化”为名的总统决定规定：每个政党为了要被承认为政党，必须在其党章中明确规定，这个政党必须接受和支持载明国家基础的原则的印度尼西亚共和国宪法。决定特别指出，所谓国家基础指的是信仰真主、民族主义、人民主权、人道主义和社会公道。
    这项决定规定，要求被承认的政党的党章还必须规定，“政党的目标必须是根据印度尼西亚民族的特点建设公道和繁荣的社会，并且必须以总统的政治宣言作为它的工作纲领的基础。”
    决定还规定，每个政党必须“通过和平和民主的方法”来实现它们各自的目标。
    决定规定的政党的另一个条件是，它必须在至少构成全国一级自治区总数四分之一的地区内设有支部。
    决定还规定，总统有权监督或发出命令，检查各政党的一般事务、财务和资产。总统有权取缔或解散政党。决定规定，“被认为违反国家基本原则和目标的任何政党”可以予以取缔或解散。
    决定规定，在恢复1945年宪法时已经建立的、并具备决定所规定的条件的政党，可以被承认为政党。
