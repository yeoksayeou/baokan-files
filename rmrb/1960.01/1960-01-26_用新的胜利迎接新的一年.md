Greet the New Year with New Victories
To the Editor:
    When the good news that the Second Five-Year Plan was completed three years ahead of schedule reached our commune, the commune members scrambled to read the newspapers and listen to the radio. The commune members all said that the great achievements of 1959 were a victory for the Party's General Line.
    Our commune in this mountain area outside the Great Wall used to be a place that lacked grain every year. In 1959, not only was there enough to eat and use, but we also sold 2.5 million jin of surplus grain to the state. The People's Commune also developed a diversified economy. The number of pigs increased by 120% compared to 1958. Just the pigs, cattle, and sheep sold to the state averaged nearly two head per household. Last year, in our remote mountainous area, we also repaired the roads, and the number of trucks increased sevenfold.
    Now, our production is in full swing. The entire commune averages 8,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of land, repaired more than 20 irrigation canals, and built three hydroelectric power stations. In this new year, all of our commune members are determined to increase the total grain output by another 40% compared to 1959, and to achieve an even greater leap forward in forestry, animal husbandry, industry, and sideline occupations.
               First Secretary of the Tanghekou People's Commune Party Committee, Huairou County Deng Lianhui

    用新的胜利迎接新的一年编辑同志：
    当第二个五年计划提前三年完成的喜讯传到我们公社的时候，社员们争读报纸，收听广播。社员们都说1959年伟大成就是党的总路线的胜利。
    我们这个塞外山区的公社，过去是年年缺粮的地方，在1959年不但够吃够用，还卖给国家二百五十万斤余粮。人民公社还发展了多种经济，猪比1958年增加了120％，光是卖给国家的猪、牛、羊，平均每户将近两头。去年我们这个交通闭塞的山区，还整修了公路，汽轮大车的数量增加了七倍。
    现在，我们的生产闹的热火朝天，全社平均为每亩田积肥八千斤，修好了二十多条引水渠道，建成了三座水力发电站。在这新的一年里，我们全体社员决心叫粮食总产量比1959年再增四成，林业、畜牧业、工业、副业都要来个更大跃进。
                怀柔县汤河口人民公社党委第一书记  邓连惠
