Editor's Note: This year's New Year special issue of the Japanese "Asahi Pictorial" published talks by twelve representative figures from various circles in Japan on opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty." Excerpts are translated below:

    Kunisuke Nagano, President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, said: We opposed the revision of the "Police Duties Law," and we also oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty." We believe that fundamentally, the "Security Treaty" should be abolished. Because the "Security Treaty," especially the new "Security Treaty," is a military alliance hostile to China and the Soviet Union, even if the period of validity is limited to ten years, it will seriously hinder Japan's amity and friendship with China and the Soviet Union. From a legal point of view, it also violates Article 9 of the Constitution, which stipulates the renunciation of war, and carries the danger of inducing war.

    Hiroshi Minami, Vice-Chairman of the National Cultural Conference, said: If the "Security Treaty" is revised in the direction that the government says, peace will be threatened. Obviously, if the new "Security Treaty" is signed, a secrecy law, an anti-espionage law, and revisions to the "Police Duties Law" will follow domestically, and therefore freedom of speech will also be restricted. Needless to say, according to the new treaty, "defense" spending for war preparations will increase. Even if the treaty has a different name, it is militaristic and will cast a dark shadow over the people. Cultural circles across the country, cultural workers in workplaces, and so on, are enthusiastically carrying out movements against the revision of the treaty in their individual capacities.

    Yoko Matsuoka, initiator of the Japan-China Cultural Relations Round Table, said: The dangers posed by this revision of the "Security Treaty" are: further deterioration of Japan-China relations, exacerbating tensions in Asia; because the United States undertakes the obligation to defend Japan, Japan will also be forced to undertake new obligations, strengthen its military obligations, and the accompanying strengthening of the domestic system (government officials have already emphasized the need to revise the Police Duties Law, enact a secrecy law, and revise the Constitution), which will be a major obstacle to Japan's realization of democracy.

    Chozaburo Inoue of the Security Treaty Criticism Group said: We are artists, and we hate war the most. Revising the "Security Treaty" is to establish a military alliance. In order to create national art, the country must get rid of its colonial status. I think this is a major prerequisite. The three groups of Free Art, Japan Art Association, and Peace Art Association have already issued statements opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty." I am afraid that the number of people in the art world who oppose the revision will reach two thousand. People with lofty ideals are painting propaganda paintings and making badges to appeal to the people as artists.

    Kenzo Nakajima, Director-General of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, said: Although Japan and China are still at war, the relationship between the two countries cannot be severed. It is an abnormal state for the two countries not to establish friendly relations, and it should not be like this for the sake of peace. Both sides have a feeling that if things cannot go smoothly in the political aspect, then even if it is only in the cultural aspect, it will be good, so the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Agreement was signed. The Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association has been carrying out activities to promote friendship in accordance with this policy, such as sending theater troupes, holding exhibitions, and exchanging personnel. Revising the "Security Treaty" is to make Japan completely a satellite country of the United States. The "Security Treaty" should have been abolished. Why is it necessary to revise it so urgently now? Whether it is strengthening military preparations with one's own strength or relying on the strength of other countries to strengthen military preparations, it is dangerous. Restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China is a wise move, and intelligent Liberal Democratic Party Diet members also think so. Although people think that the current "Security Treaty" is temporary in nature and may become invalid with the evolution of the world situation, the government and the ruling party say that it is indefinite. They also claim that the new "Security Treaty" has a valid period of ten years. Don't they know that the next ten years will be equal to a century of the past?

    Yoshitaro Hirano, Director-General of the Japan Peace Committee, said: The purpose of revising the "Security Treaty" is: to transport nuclear weapons into Japan and equip the Self-Defense Forces with missiles; and to make Japan bear this obligation in the form of a treaty. This is the most important point in revising the "Security Treaty." It goes without saying what the consequences would be if nuclear weapons were placed in Japan once a war broke out. However, if it is linked to the nuclear armament of West Germany, the purpose of revising the "Security Treaty" will be very clear. Judging from domestic trends alone, it can also be seen that the US Seventh Fleet, equipped with nuclear weapons, uses Yokosuka and Sasebo as its bases, and the Fifth Air Force Command is located in Fuchu, Tokyo. The Japanese Air Self-Defense Force is also stationed there. The "Six-Year Defense Plan" shows that it will be equipped with Nike, Bomarc and other missiles; K84 and K100 aircraft are conducting training in dropping small atomic bombs. Everyone knows that defense industry departments such as New Mitsubishi Heavy Industries are conducting missile research. If these facts are linked together, it can be seen that the purpose of revising the "Security Treaty" is clearly to nuclearize Japan.

    Kitaro Shimizu of the Security Treaty Problem Research Group said: The new "Security Treaty" is a new military alliance. This time, the Japanese people must be responsible to the whole world and must make decisions after full consideration. I would like to loudly appeal to everyone that Japan is currently standing at a crossroads of choosing peace or choosing militarism.

    Kazuko Yamaga of the Japan Mothers' Congress Working Committee said: The new "Security Treaty" is a military alliance, and we feel the danger of war here. Nuclear weapons have already been transported into the country. Although it is said that there will be prior consultations, there are no provisions stipulating that Japanese consent is required; the government cannot refuse to send troops abroad. Currently, the government is using a budget of over 100 billion yen to reorganize its military, and it is obvious that this kind of expenditure will further increase after the "Lockheed" model is determined.

    Shinkichi Unno, head of the Lawyers' Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty, said: Since the Meiji era, all wars have been waged in the name of "self-defense." The new Constitution stipulates in Article 9 that (Japan) must renounce war and not possess combat forces. If it is said that "the US military stationed in Japan is not the Japanese army, therefore it is not a combat force and does not violate the Constitution," then the "Security Treaty," which currently requires the US military to be stationed in Japan, is an attempt to evade the law even as a government action, and it is a completely absurd sophistry. We cannot allow something to exist in the country that is not bound by Japanese sovereignty. We must abolish this "Security Treaty" that violates the Constitution in the name of the government. The people must continue to struggle with the same great efforts that they made in the past to abolish the unequal treaties of the Ansei period (Ansei is the Japanese era name; in June of the fifth year of Ansei, Japan signed an unequal treaty of commerce with five countries: the United States, the Netherlands, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France – Editor’s note).

    Tatsuo Tsuda of the Japan Congress of Journalists said: Under the current Japanese political system, newspaper reporters can only have some vague ideas because they are afraid of being labeled as "red." We can also see from the pre-war experience that war broke out after journalists did not tell the truth and remained silent. Revising the "Security Treaty" is indeed dangerous and must be stopped.

    Katsuiro Kamei of the Security Treaty Criticism Group said: The reason why I oppose revising the "Security Treaty" is because every clause of that treaty is very ambiguous and there are many suspicious points. For example, in the current situation where secret weapons are very developed, saying things like "consulting in advance on an equal footing" is just a fantasy. Also, I feel a great responsibility for starting the war of aggression against China. I believe that even if the political systems are different, gradually moving in a friendly direction is a road of paramount significance for Japanese diplomacy. According to the new "Security Treaty," China has become a hypothetical enemy country. Even if it only gives that impression, I cannot agree to revising that treaty.

    Shigeaki Oda of the Young Jurists Association said: We can also see from the government's motives for revising the "Security Treaty" that if the Security Treaty is revised, due to the expansion of military preparations, the whole country will be put into a military system for a long time. At that time, the rights of the people will also be restricted, which is self-evident.

### 日本十二名有代表性的人士发表谈话  坚决反对新的日美军事同盟

    日本十二名有代表性的人士发表谈话
    坚决反对新的日美军事同盟
    编者按　日本“朝日画报”在今年的新年特大号上，刊载了日本各界十二位有代表性的人士关于反对修改“安全条约”的谈话。摘译如下：
    国际法律家联络协会会长长野国助说：我们曾经反对过修改“警职法”，我们也反对修改“安全条约”，我们认为从根本上说，应该废除“安全条约”。因为“安全条约”尤其新“安全条约”是敌视中苏的军事同盟，即使把有效期间限定为十年，也会严重地妨碍日本同中苏的亲善友好。从法律上看，还有违反规定放弃战争的宪法第九条和诱发战争的危险。
    国民文化会议副议长南博说：如果按照政府所说的方向修改“安全条约”，和平就要受到威胁。显然，如果签订了新“安全条约”，接着就会在国内制订保密法、防谍法和修改“警职法”，因而言论自由也就要受到限制。不用说，按照新条约，备战的“防卫”费将会增加。即使条约换一个名称，也是军国主义的，它将用阴暗的影子笼罩着国民。全国的文化界、工作场所的文化工作者等等，都以个人资格热心地进行着反对修改条约的运动。
    日中文化关系恳谈会发起人松冈洋子说：这次修改“安全条约”所造成的危险是：使日中关系进一步恶化，加剧亚洲紧张局势；由于使美国承担保卫日本的义务，日本也将被迫承担新的义务，加强军备义务及随之而来的加强国内体制（政府要人已经强调需要修改警职法、制订保密法和修改宪法），将是日本实现民主化的重大障碍。
    安全条约批判会的井上长三郎说：我们是美术家，我们最厌恶战争。修改“安全条约”是要建立军事同盟。为了创造国民的艺术，国家必须摆脱殖民地状态。我认为这是一个大前提。自由美术、日本美术会、和平美术会三个团体已经发表了反对修改“安全条约”的声明，美术界反对修改的人恐怕会达到两千人。有志之士正在画宣传画，制作徽章，以美术家的身份进行活动，向国民呼吁。
    日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏说：虽然日中两国还处于战争状态，但是，两国的关系是无法割断的。两国没有建立友好关系，这是不正常的状态，为和平着想，也不应该是这样的。双方都有一种心情，觉得如果在政治方面不能顺利进行，就单在文化方面也好，因而签订了日中文化交流协定。日中文化交流协会就按照这个方针，一直进行了派遣剧团、举行展览会及人物来往等等增进友好的活动。修改“安全条约”是要使日本完全成为美国的卫星国家。“安全条约”本应当废除，为什么现在却一定要急于修改呢？无论是用自己的力量加强军备，或者是依靠别国的力量来加强军备，都是危险的。恢复日中邦交，是明智的做法，有头脑的自由民主党议员也是这样想的。尽管人们认为现行“安全条约”是临时性质的，随着世界形势的演变也可能失效，但是，政府和执政党却说它是无期限的。它们还宣传说新“安全条约”的有效期间是十年。难道不知道今后的十年会等于以往的一个世纪吗？
    日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎说：修改“安全条约”的目的在于：把核武器运进日本，用导弹装备自卫队；并且用条约的形式使日本承担这个义务。这是在修改“安全条约”中最重要的一点。如果核武器摆在日本，一旦发生战争会造成什么后果，是不需多说的。不过，如果同西德的核武装联系起来看，修改“安全条约”的目的何在，就很清楚了。单就国内的动向来看，也可以知道，装备有核武器的美国第七舰队把横须贺、佐世保作为它的基地，第五空军司令部设在东京的府中。日本的航空自卫队也驻在那里。“防御六年计划”表明要装备奈克、鲍马克式等导弹；K84和K100式飞机正在进行着投掷小型原子弹的训练。任何人都知道，新三菱重工业公司等国防工业部门，正在进行导弹的研究工作。如果把这样一些事实联系起来看，就可以知道，显然修改“安全条约”的目的是要使日本核武装化。
    安全条约问题研究会的清水几太郎说：新“安全条约”是一个新的军事同盟。这次日本国民必须对全世界负责，必须经过充分的考虑作出决定。我想向大家大声疾呼，目前日本正站在选择和平还是选择军国主义的歧路上。
    日本母亲大会工作委员会的山家和子说：新的“安全条约”是一个军事同盟，我们在这里感到有战争的危险。核武器已经运进国内。虽然说什么事先协商，但是没有规定需经日方同意的条款；政府也不能拒绝派兵到国外去。目前政府在用一千多亿日元的预算去重整军备，在确定“洛克希德”机型以后将会进一步增加这方面的开支，这是显而易见的。
    法学家阻止修改安全条约会议负责人海野晋吉说：从明治时代以来，所有战争都是在“自卫”的名义下进行的。新宪法在第九条规定（日本）要放弃战争和不拥有作战力量。如果说“驻日美军不是日本的军队，因此不是作战力量，并不违反宪法”，那么，目前要求美军驻扎在日本的“安全条约”，即使作为政府的行为，也是一种企图逃避法律的行为，而且是十分荒谬的诡辩。我们不能容许在国内有不受日本统治权约束的东西存在。我们必须废除这个以政府的名义来违反宪法的“安全条约”。国民必须以过去为废除安政时期的不平等条约（安政是日本的年号，日本在安政五年六月曾经同美、荷、俄、英、法五国签订了一项不平等的通商条约——编者注）所作的同样大的努力，继续斗争下去。
    日本记者会议的津田达夫说：在目前日本的政治制度下，新闻记者因为害怕被扣上“赤化”这类字眼，而只能有一些迷迷糊糊的想法。从战前的经验我们也可以看到，在新闻工作者不讲真话而保持沉默之后就爆发了战争。修改“安全条约”的确危险，必须阻止。
    安全条约批判会的龟井胜一郎说：我所以反对修改“安全条约”是因为那项条约的每一项条款都含糊得很，有许多令人怀疑的地方。例如，在秘密武器非常发达的目前，“站在对等地位事先进行协商”之类的说法不过是一种空想罢了。还有，对于发动侵略中国的战争，我感到有很大的责任。我认为，即使政治制度不同，可是，朝着友好的方向逐步前进，这是日本外交具有头等意义的道路。按照新的“安全条约”，中国成了假想敌国。即使只因为那项条约给人以那种印象，我也不能赞成修改那项条约。
    青年法律家协会的小田成光说：从政府修改“安全条约”的动机我们也可以看出，如果修改了安全条约，由于扩充军备，全国就会长期被投入军事体制中去。到那个时候，国民的权利也会受到限制，这是不言而喻的。
