    Thoroughly Resolve the Overseas Chinese Issue Between China and Indonesia Through Friendly Consultation
    The governments of China and Indonesia exchanged instruments of ratification for the treaty on dual nationality on January 20th in Beijing, and a joint committee composed of representatives from both sides was established in Jakarta on January 25th. With these steps, the treaty between China and Indonesia on dual nationality and the exchange of letters between the two premiers on the implementation of the treaty have now come into effect. The Chinese government and people hope that, through friendly cooperation and joint efforts of both sides, the treaty on dual nationality and the exchange of letters between the two premiers will be implemented quickly and smoothly, so that the long-standing historical issue of dual nationality can be properly and reasonably resolved as soon as possible. Although the anti-Chinese and anti-China actions in Indonesia have not completely stopped due to the continued support of powerful groups, the exchange of instruments of ratification for the dual nationality treaty and the establishment of the joint committee should be regarded as a meaningful development towards a comprehensive resolution of the overseas Chinese issue existing between China and Indonesia, and therefore is something to be welcomed by the people of both countries.
    Based on the position of consolidating and developing the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, our government has always believed that the issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia should be resolved comprehensively and reasonably through friendly consultation between the two governments. In order to eliminate the phenomenon of dual nationality among overseas Chinese, China and Indonesia signed the treaty on dual nationality as early as April 22, 1955, and the two premiers exchanged letters on June 3, 1955, on the implementation of this treaty. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China decided to approve this treaty on December 30, 1957. The Chinese government has consistently advocated for the early exchange of instruments of ratification so that the treaty could take effect and be implemented. Therefore, despite the fact that the Indonesian side violated the provisions of the dual nationality treaty and the exchange of letters between the two premiers in June 1959 by unilaterally promulgating an implementing regulation that was inconsistent with the principles of the treaty, thus creating a complex situation, and the large-scale anti-Chinese and anti-China activities that had already emerged in Indonesia also brought difficulties to the implementation of the treaty, the Chinese government, while pointing out the above facts, immediately agreed to the proposal put forward by the Indonesian side in September 1959 to exchange instruments of ratification for the dual nationality treaty and establish a joint committee. Our Foreign Minister Chen Yi also put forward three suggestions on December 9 last year for a comprehensive resolution of the overseas Chinese issue, advocating that the two governments immediately appoint representatives to conduct negotiations. Now, the two countries have exchanged instruments of ratification for the treaty on dual nationality and have established a joint committee to promote the implementation of the treaty, giving the implementation of this treaty a legal basis and the necessary institutions. We hope that the representatives of both sides of the joint committee, in the spirit of friendly consultation, will discuss and formulate measures and necessary steps for the implementation of this treaty based on the principles established in the dual nationality treaty and the exchange of letters between the two premiers, so that the dual nationality issue can be resolved quickly and smoothly.
    Overseas Chinese with dual nationality have been residing in Indonesia for generations, engaged in productive labor. They have lived and fought side by side with the Indonesian people in the arduous struggle against colonialism and for national independence, forming a close bond. They not only live in harmony with the local people in economic and cultural life, but many have even integrated with the Indonesian people in terms of language and customs. Therefore, it is perfectly understandable that the majority of them are willing to choose Indonesian nationality. Our government and people understand and endorse their wishes, and hope that they can choose Indonesian nationality based on the principle of voluntariness, become citizens of that country, and dedicate themselves to the cause of national independence and construction of that country. This is beneficial both to the overseas Chinese themselves and to Indonesia. Therefore, this treaty and the exchange of letters between the two premiers have been warmly welcomed by the people of Indonesia and China.
    Now, the dual nationality treaty and the exchange of letters between the two premiers have come into effect, and the joint committee has been established. In order to achieve the purpose of resolving the dual nationality issue according to the treaty, the two premiers affirmed in the exchange of letters that "the two governments agree to take all necessary measures and provide all kinds of conveniences in the implementation of the above-mentioned treaty so that everyone with dual nationality can voluntarily choose their nationality." The joint committee, which is responsible for discussing and stipulating the implementation measures of the treaty, should naturally carry out its work in accordance with the above guiding principles. However, with the anti-Chinese and anti-China activities continuing in Indonesia, the work of the joint committee is obviously difficult to proceed smoothly. And in such a situation, overseas Chinese with dual nationality will inevitably find it difficult to voluntarily choose their nationality. Not only are those who originally wanted to choose Indonesian nationality full of concerns, but also those who can contribute to Indonesia's economic development feel that the future of continuing to reside there is bleak. This is of course not in line with the principles and spirit of the treaty between the two countries on the issue of dual nationality. Our government and people hope that this situation can be brought to a swift end.
    The reasonable resolution of the dual nationality issue is an important step towards a comprehensive and thorough resolution of the overseas Chinese issue between China and Indonesia. After voluntarily choosing their nationality, those who have joined Indonesian nationality should naturally enjoy Indonesian citizenship rights and should not be subject to any discrimination. But there will also be some people who voluntarily retain Chinese nationality, and we hope that the Indonesian government will effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of these overseas Chinese in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the treaty and the principles of the joint communiqu√© of the two foreign ministers. In addition, there are some displaced overseas Chinese who cannot make a living or are unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia and request to return to their motherland. Our government has expressed its welcome for them to return and is prepared to arrange for them to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland according to their wishes. We hope that the Indonesian government can make proper arrangements for the repatriation of these overseas Chinese.
    In order to create an atmosphere of friendly cooperation for the negotiations of the joint committee, to ensure the smooth implementation of the treaty, and to facilitate the comprehensive resolution of the overseas Chinese issue, our Ambassador to Indonesia Huang Zhen, on behalf of the Chinese government, put forward the following specific requirements to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio: immediately stop the forced relocation and other persecution of overseas Chinese; the Indonesian government, when implementing its relevant decrees on overseas Chinese, should give overseas Chinese a certain period of time to make choices, to prepare for either choosing a nationality, relocating, or returning to their country; immediately release all overseas Chinese arrested in the process of forced relocation; the Indonesian government should take care of the lives of the overseas Chinese who have been forced to relocate and concentrate, and compensate for their losses; for overseas Chinese who have lost their livelihoods or are unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia, the Indonesian government should assist them in gathering at designated ports, waiting for repatriation, and ensure their safety on the way to the ports and be responsible for their food and accommodation in the ports; allow overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to their country to sell their property and bring back the funds they have obtained; the Indonesian government should quickly arrange ships to repatriate the above-mentioned overseas Chinese in batches, ensuring the safety of overseas Chinese on their way back to their country. Foreign Minister Chen Yi has also notified Indonesian Ambassador to China Sukardjo that the Chinese government will dispatch ships to Indonesia this month to pick up overseas Chinese returning to their country. We hope that the Indonesian government can accept the above requirements of our government so that overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to their country can smoothly realize their wishes.
    We believe that as long as China and Indonesia both work together in the spirit of friendly cooperation, the dual nationality treaty will surely be implemented smoothly, and the overseas Chinese issue in Indonesia will not be difficult to resolve comprehensively and reasonably. This will not only help consolidate and develop the friendly relations between the two countries, depriving imperialism of an excuse to provoke relations between the two countries; but it will also set an example for Asian and African countries to resolve complex dual nationality issues through friendly consultation.
