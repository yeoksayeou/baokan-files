    Thoroughly Resolve the Overseas Chinese Issue Between China and Indonesia Through Friendly Consultation
    The governments of China and Indonesia exchanged instruments of ratification for the treaty on dual nationality on January 20th in Beijing, and a joint committee composed of representatives from both sides was established in Jakarta on January 25th. With these steps, the treaty between China and Indonesia on dual nationality and the exchange of letters between the two premiers on the implementation of the treaty have now come into effect. The Chinese government and people hope that, through friendly cooperation and joint efforts of both sides, the treaty on dual nationality and the exchange of letters between the two premiers will be implemented quickly and smoothly, so that the long-standing historical issue of dual nationality can be properly and reasonably resolved as soon as possible. Although the anti-Chinese and anti-China actions in Indonesia have not completely stopped due to the continued support of powerful groups, the exchange of instruments of ratification for the dual nationality treaty and the establishment of the joint committee should be regarded as a meaningful development towards a comprehensive resolution of the overseas Chinese issue existing between China and Indonesia, and therefore is something to be welcomed by the people of both countries.
    Based on the position of consolidating and developing the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, our government has always believed that the issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia should be resolved comprehensively and reasonably through friendly consultation between the two governments. In order to eliminate the phenomenon of dual nationality among overseas Chinese, China and Indonesia signed the treaty on dual nationality as early as April 22, 1955, and the two premiers exchanged letters on June 3, 1955, on the implementation of this treaty. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China decided to approve this treaty on December 30, 1957. The Chinese government has consistently advocated for the early exchange of instruments of ratification so that the treaty could take effect and be implemented. Therefore, despite the fact that the Indonesian side violated the provisions of the dual nationality treaty and the exchange of letters between the two premiers in June 1959 by unilaterally promulgating an implementing regulation that was inconsistent with the principles of the treaty, thus creating a complex situation, and the large-scale anti-Chinese and anti-China activities that had already emerged in Indonesia also brought difficulties to the implementation of the treaty, the Chinese government, while pointing out the above facts, immediately agreed to the proposal put forward by the Indonesian side in September 1959 to exchange instruments of ratification for the dual nationality treaty and establish a joint committee. Our Foreign Minister Chen Yi also put forward three suggestions on December 9 last year for a comprehensive resolution of the overseas Chinese issue, advocating that the two governments immediately appoint representatives to conduct negotiations. Now, the two countries have exchanged instruments of ratification for the treaty on dual nationality and have established a joint committee to promote the implementation of the treaty, giving the implementation of this treaty a legal basis and the necessary institutions. We hope that the representatives of both sides of the joint committee, in the spirit of friendly consultation, will discuss and formulate measures and necessary steps for the implementation of this treaty based on the principles established in the dual nationality treaty and the exchange of letters between the two premiers, so that the dual nationality issue can be resolved quickly and smoothly.
    Overseas Chinese with dual nationality have been residing in Indonesia for generations, engaged in productive labor. They have lived and fought side by side with the Indonesian people in the arduous struggle against colonialism and for national independence, forming a close bond. They not only live in harmony with the local people in economic and cultural life, but many have even integrated with the Indonesian people in terms of language and customs. Therefore, it is perfectly understandable that the majority of them are willing to choose Indonesian nationality. Our government and people understand and endorse their wishes, and hope that they can choose Indonesian nationality based on the principle of voluntariness, become citizens of that country, and dedicate themselves to the cause of national independence and construction of that country. This is beneficial both to the overseas Chinese themselves and to Indonesia. Therefore, this treaty and the exchange of letters between the two premiers have been warmly welcomed by the people of Indonesia and China.
    Now, the dual nationality treaty and the exchange of letters between the two premiers have come into effect, and the joint committee has been established. In order to achieve the purpose of resolving the dual nationality issue according to the treaty, the two premiers affirmed in the exchange of letters that "the two governments agree to take all necessary measures and provide all kinds of conveniences in the implementation of the above-mentioned treaty so that everyone with dual nationality can voluntarily choose their nationality." The joint committee, which is responsible for discussing and stipulating the implementation measures of the treaty, should naturally carry out its work in accordance with the above guiding principles. However, with the anti-Chinese and anti-China activities continuing in Indonesia, the work of the joint committee is obviously difficult to proceed smoothly. And in such a situation, overseas Chinese with dual nationality will inevitably find it difficult to voluntarily choose their nationality. Not only are those who originally wanted to choose Indonesian nationality full of concerns, but also those who can contribute to Indonesia's economic development feel that the future of continuing to reside there is bleak. This is of course not in line with the principles and spirit of the treaty between the two countries on the issue of dual nationality. Our government and people hope that this situation can be brought to a swift end.
    The reasonable resolution of the dual nationality issue is an important step towards a comprehensive and thorough resolution of the overseas Chinese issue between China and Indonesia. After voluntarily choosing their nationality, those who have joined Indonesian nationality should naturally enjoy Indonesian citizenship rights and should not be subject to any discrimination. But there will also be some people who voluntarily retain Chinese nationality, and we hope that the Indonesian government will effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of these overseas Chinese in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the treaty and the principles of the joint communiqué of the two foreign ministers. In addition, there are some displaced overseas Chinese who cannot make a living or are unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia and request to return to their motherland. Our government has expressed its welcome for them to return and is prepared to arrange for them to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland according to their wishes. We hope that the Indonesian government can make proper arrangements for the repatriation of these overseas Chinese.
    In order to create an atmosphere of friendly cooperation for the negotiations of the joint committee, to ensure the smooth implementation of the treaty, and to facilitate the comprehensive resolution of the overseas Chinese issue, our Ambassador to Indonesia Huang Zhen, on behalf of the Chinese government, put forward the following specific requirements to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio: immediately stop the forced relocation and other persecution of overseas Chinese; the Indonesian government, when implementing its relevant decrees on overseas Chinese, should give overseas Chinese a certain period of time to make choices, to prepare for either choosing a nationality, relocating, or returning to their country; immediately release all overseas Chinese arrested in the process of forced relocation; the Indonesian government should take care of the lives of the overseas Chinese who have been forced to relocate and concentrate, and compensate for their losses; for overseas Chinese who have lost their livelihoods or are unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia, the Indonesian government should assist them in gathering at designated ports, waiting for repatriation, and ensure their safety on the way to the ports and be responsible for their food and accommodation in the ports; allow overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to their country to sell their property and bring back the funds they have obtained; the Indonesian government should quickly arrange ships to repatriate the above-mentioned overseas Chinese in batches, ensuring the safety of overseas Chinese on their way back to their country. Foreign Minister Chen Yi has also notified Indonesian Ambassador to China Sukardjo that the Chinese government will dispatch ships to Indonesia this month to pick up overseas Chinese returning to their country. We hope that the Indonesian government can accept the above requirements of our government so that overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to their country can smoothly realize their wishes.
    We believe that as long as China and Indonesia both work together in the spirit of friendly cooperation, the dual nationality treaty will surely be implemented smoothly, and the overseas Chinese issue in Indonesia will not be difficult to resolve comprehensively and reasonably. This will not only help consolidate and develop the friendly relations between the two countries, depriving imperialism of an excuse to provoke relations between the two countries; but it will also set an example for Asian and African countries to resolve complex dual nationality issues through friendly consultation.

### 通过友好协商全面解决中国和印度尼西亚间的华侨问题

    通过友好协商全面解决中国和印度尼西亚间的华侨问题
    我国政府和印度尼西亚政府已于本月20日在北京互换了关于双重国籍问题的条约的批准书，并于本月25日在雅加达成立了由双方代表组成的联合委员会。由于这一步骤，中国和印度尼西亚关于双重国籍问题的条约和两国总理关于条约实施办法的换文，现在已经生效。中国政府和人民希望，经过双方的友好合作和共同努力，双重国籍问题条约和两国总理的换文将能迅速地和顺利地付诸实施，从而使双重国籍这个长期历史所遗留下来的问题早日得到妥善合理的解决。尽管目前在印度尼西亚的排华反华行动由于有势力集团的继续支持而并末完全停止，但是，双重国籍问题条约终于互换批准书和联合委员会的终于成立，无论如何，应该认为是对于全面解决存在于中国和印度尼西亚之间的华侨问题的一个有意义的发展，因而是值得两国人民高兴的。
    我国政府本着巩固和发展中国和印度尼西亚友好关系的立场，一向认为，在印度尼西亚的华侨问题，应该经过两国政府的友好协商，谋求全面的合理的解决。为了消除华侨具有双重国籍的现象，我国和印度尼西亚早在1955年4月22日就签订了关于双重国籍问题的条约，两国总理并在1955年6月3日就这个条约的实施办法进行了换文。我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会已于1957年12月30日决定批准这个条约。中国政府一向主张应尽早互换批准书，以便使条约生效和付诸实施。因此，尽管印度尼西亚方面在1959年6月违反双重国籍条约和两国总理换文的规定，单方面颁布了一项同条约的原则不相符合的实施条例，从而造成了复杂的情况，同时在印度尼西亚已经出现的大规模反华排华活动，也给条约的实施带来了困难，但是，中国政府在指出上述事实的同时，仍然对于印度尼西亚方面在1959年9月提出的互换关于双重国籍条约批准书和成立联合委员会的建议，当即表示同意。我国陈毅外长并在去年12月9日提出了全面解决华侨问题的三点建议，主张两国政府立即指派代表进行谈判。现在，两国已经互换了关于双重国籍问题的条约的批准书，并且成立了促进条约实施的联合委员会，使这一条约的实施有了法律基础和必要的机构。我们希望，联合委员会的双方代表，将本着友好协商的精神，根据双重国籍条约和两国总理换文所确立的原则，讨论和拟定有关实施这个条约的办法和必须采取的措施，使双重国籍问题能够迅速得到顺利的解决。
    具有双重国籍的华侨，都是在印度尼西亚世代定居，从事于生产劳动的。他们在印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的艰苦斗争中，同印度尼西亚人民共同生活，并肩奋斗，结成了血肉相连的关系。他们不但在经济和文化生活方面，同当地人民和衷共处，甚至不少人在语言和生活习惯方面已经同印度尼西亚人民融合在一起。因此，他们当中多数人愿意选择印度尼西亚国籍，这是完全可以理解的。我国政府和人民谅解和赞同他们的愿望，希望他们能够根据自愿的原则，选择印度尼西亚国籍，成为这个国家的公民，献身于这个国家的民族独立和建设事业。这对于华侨自己和对于印度尼西亚来说，都是有利的。因此，这个条约和两国总理的换文受到了印度尼西亚和中国人民的热烈欢迎。
    现在，双重国籍条约和两国总理换文已经生效，联合委员会已经成立。为了达到根据条约解决双重国籍问题的目的，两国总理在换文中曾经肯定，“两国政府同意在实施上述条约时，采取一切必要的措施和提供各种便利条件，使每一个具有双重国籍的人，都能够自愿地选择他们的国籍。”负有讨论和规定条约实施办法的任务的联合委员会，自然应该根据上述指导原则进行工作。但是，在印度尼西亚反华排华活动继续未已的情况下，联合委员会的工作显然很难顺利进行。而且在这样的情况下，具有双重国籍的华侨势必很难自愿地选择他们的国籍。不仅原来想选择印度尼西亚国籍的人顾虑重重，而且那些能够对印度尼西亚的经济发展作出贡献的人也感到继续居留下去前途茫茫。这当然是不符合两国关于双重国籍问题的条约的原则和精神的。我国政府和人民希望这种情况能够迅速结束。
    双重国籍问题的合理解决，是全面彻底解决中国和印度尼西亚两国之间的华侨问题的一个重要的步骤。经过自愿选择国籍之后，那些加入了印度尼西亚国籍的人，自然应当享受印度尼西亚的公民权利，不应当受到任何歧视。但是也会有一部分人自愿保留中国国籍的，我们希望印度尼西亚政府对于这部分华侨的正当权利和利益能够根据条约第十一条的规定和两国外交部长联合公报的原则，予以切实保护。另外，还有一部分流离失所、无法谋生或者不愿继续居留在印度尼西亚而要求返回祖国的华侨，我国政府已表示欢迎他们回来，准备根据他们的志愿，安排他们参加祖国的社会主义建设。我们希望印度尼西亚政府能够就这部分华侨的回国问题，作出妥善安排。
    为了给联合委员会的谈判创造友好合作的气氛，为了保证条约的顺利实施，为了便于华侨问题的全面解决，我国驻印度尼西亚的黄镇大使代表中国政府向印度尼西亚政府的苏班德里约外交部长提出了以下的具体要求：立即停止对华侨的逼迁和其他迫害活动；印度尼西亚政府在执行其有关华侨的法令时，应当给予华侨一定时间，以便进行选择，作或者迁移、或者归国的准备；立即释放在逼迁过程中被拘捕的全部华侨；对已被逼迁和集中的华侨，印度尼西亚政府应当照顾他们的生活，赔偿他们的损失；对丧失生计或不愿意继续居留在印度尼西亚的华侨，印度尼西亚政府应当协助他们前往指定的港口集结，等待遣送返国，并且保证他们在前往港口途中的安全和负责他们在港口的食宿；允许自愿回国的华侨变卖自己的产业和带回所得的资金；印度尼西亚政府应当迅速安排船只，分期分批遣送上述华侨返国，保证华侨在归国途中的安全。陈毅外长并已通知印度尼西亚驻我国的苏加佐大使，中国政府在本月内即将派遣船只前往印度尼西亚接运华侨回国。我们希望印度尼西亚政府能够接纳我国政府的上述要求，使自愿返国的华侨得以顺利实现他们的愿望。
    我们相信，只要中国和印度尼西亚双方都本着友好合作的精神，共同努力，双重国籍条约就一定能够顺利实施，在印度尼西亚的华侨问题也不难求得全面的合理的解决。这不仅将有助于两国友好关系的巩固和发展，剥夺帝国主义挑拨两国关系的一个借口；而且也将为亚非国家通过友好协商、解决相互间存在的复杂的双重国籍问题树立一个榜样。
