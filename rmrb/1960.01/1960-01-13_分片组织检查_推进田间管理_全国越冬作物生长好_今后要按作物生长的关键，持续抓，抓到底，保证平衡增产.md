Xinhua News Agency, 12th - To strive for a bumper harvest of summer crops in 1960, the Ministry of Agriculture's first field inspection of overwintering crops across the country has concluded. This inspection has greatly promoted the current field management of overwintering crops in various regions.

Organizing inspections is an important measure taken by the Ministry of Agriculture this year to understand and promote national agricultural production. In addition to several major inspections of overwintering crops during important key periods in the future, several nationwide inspections will also be organized this year for spring plowing preparation, spring sowing, and important crop production such as cotton. The inspection method involves dividing the country into several regions based on production characteristics. Each region is organized into an inspection team by cadres from relevant provinces, cities, and autonomous regions at the county level or above who lead agricultural production in the Party and government. The Ministry of Agriculture also sends personnel to participate, taking turns to inspect relevant provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and randomly inspect some counties and people's communes. This allows for timely detection and resolution of production problems, as well as mutual inspection, mutual promotion, and exchange of experiences. This inspection of overwintering crops in fifteen provinces and cities in the South and North was conducted in four regions. The fifteen provinces and cities jointly inspected the growth of overwintering crops and current field management in fifty-nine counties, cities, and more than one hundred people's communes.

According to the reports of the four inspection teams, the planting area of ​​overwintering crops in the inspected areas has generally increased significantly. Wheat, rapeseed, green manure, and miscellaneous grains are all planted more than in 1958. The quality of sowing has greatly improved, the land is deeply cultivated and finely harrowed, the planting density is appropriate, and the area, quantity, and quality of base fertilizer application have all improved compared to 1958. In the Huaibei area, there has historically been a habit of sowing without fertilizer application; this time, base fertilizer was applied to all fields during sowing. The sowing period was generally seven to fifteen days earlier than in 1958. All kinds of winter-sown crops basically use improved varieties. After the end of sowing, adhering to the spirit of "three parts planting, seven parts management," various regions immediately launched a field management campaign. All communes have organized field management professional teams and established field management systems. Due to good sowing and meticulous management, all crops are now growing vigorously and more evenly than in previous years. As the overwintering crop inspection team of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Beijing reported, first and second-class seedlings account for about 90%, while third-class seedlings only account for about 10%.

All regions attach great importance to this inspection. Through the inspection, the current field management of overwintering crops has been greatly advanced. The vast number of cadres and masses in the counties and communes visited by the inspection teams were also greatly encouraged and took practical actions to welcome the inspection. For example, in order to welcome the inspection, the cadres and masses of the Xinhua Brigade of the Kanshan People's Commune in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang, spent three days watering more than 1,400 acres of barley and wheat three times and also carried out pest control and other work. Due to the promotion of this inspection, the field management work in the Huaiyin area of Jiangsu Province resulted in one additional fertilizer application for overwintering crops throughout the area. According to reports from the southern Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei inspection teams and the northern two teams, the same situation exists. For example, on the evening after the inspection, Pinglu County in Shanxi mobilized the masses to re-sort all wheat fields, carry out meticulous management based on specific conditions, and harrowed and rolled 120,000 acres of wheat fields and top-dressed more than 30,000 acres within two days.

The inspection also found that some early-sown wheat showed excessive growth, and rapeseed showed early bolting and flowering. The Northwest and North China are relatively dry, and some areas have overwintering crop diseases and insect pests. For example, some wheat in the Northwest and North China regions has rust, and some rapeseed in the South has virus diseases. More than 10% of the third-class seedlings are growing poorly. However, a small number of cadres and the masses believe that the sowing quality is good and the general growth is good, and have blind optimism, and have relaxed field management somewhat. Some places have not yet established a field management responsibility system and lack regular management. These problems have been brought to the attention of various regions after being raised during the inspection.

Based on this inspection, the Ministry of Agriculture conducted a study on the current field management of overwintering crops. The Ministry of Agriculture believes that the field management of wheat in 1958 was greatly emphasized only after greening, last year it was started before greening. This year, it has been advanced one step further. The current period is a critical period for overwintering crops such as wheat to take root and tiller. Good management will be beneficial to greening and harvest. Judging from this inspection, the sowing, quality, and field management of overwintering crops in various regions are earlier and better than in previous years. However, we must never be satisfied with the achievements we have made. There is still much to be done in field management. We should take advantage of the victory and move forward and continue to advance and ensure balanced production increases.

The Ministry of Agriculture believes that the current field management of overwintering crops should also focus on the following tasks:

First of all, there is currently a blind optimistic mood of varying degrees among a few cadres and the masses, which is very unfavorable for further carrying out field management of winter-sown crops. It is necessary to correct this sentiment in a timely manner. At present, various regions must seize the opportunity to strive to cover a layer of wax fertilizer on overwintering wheat, rapeseed, miscellaneous grains, and other crops, cultivate roots and protect against cold and frost, and prevent excessive growth; strive to eliminate rust, insect pests, etc. in the overwintering stage. It is best to apply the greening fertilizer in advance before the Spring Festival, so that the fertilizer effect can be exerted when the wheat turns green after the Spring Festival. Various regions in the south should also pay attention to opening ditches to prevent waterlogging; drought-affected areas should pay attention to irrigation. Rapeseed production is still a weak link in agricultural production. Therefore, various regions should pay special attention to grasping the field management of rapeseed, so as to achieve a harvest for every mu planted, a bumper harvest for every mu, and a bumper harvest for every plot. The yield of overwintering miscellaneous grain crops planted in various regions in the south has not been high over the years. At present, attention should be paid to strengthening field management and strive to increase the yield per unit area.

Secondly, various regions should organize professional teams at all levels, fix labor, improve the field management responsibility system and archive system, and adopt the method of commune cadres contracting teams, team cadres contracting plots, and commune members contracting fields, and fixing people, fixing fields, fixing time, fixing work points, and fixing quality. With fixed labor and a clear responsibility system, every specific measure of field management can be done quickly and meticulously.

Third, inspection and evaluation is a basic method of leading agricultural production. It is necessary to strengthen seasonal inspection and evaluation, promote advanced experience, and help backward units catch up, and strive for comprehensive and balanced leap forward. The method of Yangzhong County in Jiangsu is very good and worth learning from various regions. Yangzhong County stipulates that the county conducts inspections once a month, the commune conducts inspections every ten days, and the team conducts inspections every five days. Inspections and evaluations are carried out simultaneously, and field meetings are held to introduce advanced experience where there is advancement, and where there is backwardness, the reasons are found and backwardness is helped to catch up with the advanced.

Finally, the Ministry of Agriculture hopes that various regions and people's communes will continue to manage overwintering crops according to the key to crop growth and not relax. The experience of Anguo County in Hebei Province in "Focusing on Eight Months, Fighting Sixteen Sections" in managing wheat fields during the Great Leap Forward is worth promoting in various regions.

    分片组织检查　推进田间管理
    全国越冬作物生长好
    今后要按作物生长的关键，持续抓，抓到底，保证平衡增产
    新华社12日讯　为争取1960年夏季农作物丰收，农业部所组织的对各地越冬作物的第一次田间大检查已经结束。这次检查大大推动了当前各地越冬作物的田间管理工作。
    组织检查是农业部今年了解和推动全国农业生产的一个重要措施。除越冬作物今后在重要关键时期还要组织几次大检查外，今年春耕准备、春播以及重要作物如棉花生产，都将组织几次全国性的大检查。检查方法是把全国按生产特点分成几片，每片由有关省、市、自治区抽调县级以上的领导农业生产的党和政府的干部组织检查组，农业部也派人参加，轮流到有关省、市、自治区检查，并抽查一些县和人民公社。这样既可做到及时发现生产中的问题及时解决，又可起互相检查、互相推动和交流经验的作用。这次对南方、北方十五个省市的越冬作物的检查是分四片进行的。十五个省、市共抽查了五十九个县、市和一百多个人民公社的越冬作物的生长情况和当前的田间管理情况。
    据四个检查组的汇报，这次检查的地区，越冬作物播种面积一般都有显著增加。小麦、油菜、绿肥、杂粮都比1958年种得多。播种质量有很大提高，土地耕得深、耙得细，密植适度，施底肥的面积、数量和质量都比1958年提高。淮北地区历年都有白茬下种的习惯，这次在播种时全部施了底肥。播种期一般比1958年提早七天到十五天。各种冬播作物基本上都采用良种。各地在结束播种之后，本着“三分种，七分管”的精神，立即开展了田间管理运动。各公社都组织了田间管理专业队，建立了田间管理制度。由于种得好，管理精细，现在各种作物都生长健壮，而且都比往年长得均衡。如河北、山东、河南、北京四省、市越冬作物检查组检查说明，一、二类苗约占90％左右，三类苗只占10％上下。
    各地对这次大检查都很重视。通过检查，把当前越冬作物的田间管理工作大大推进了一步。检查组所到的县和公社，广大干部和群众也受到很大鼓舞，都以实际行动来迎接检查。如浙江萧山县坎山人民公社新华大队的干部和群众为迎接检查，三天时间就把一千四百多亩大麦、小麦普遍浇了三次水，还进行了治虫等工作。江苏淮阴专区的田间管理工作，因这次检查的促进，全区越冬作物多追了一次肥。另据南方四川、湖南、江西、湖北检查组和北方两个组汇报，也有同样情况，如山西平陆县在检查后的当天晚上，就动员群众对所有的麦田进行一次重新排队，根据具体情况，进行精细管理，两天内就碾耱麦田十二万亩，追肥三万多亩。
    这次检查也发现有些早种的小麦有生长过旺的现象，油菜有提早拔节抽苔现象；西北、华北比较干旱，有的地区发生越冬作物有病虫害。如西北和华北地区部分小麦有锈病，南方有的地方油菜有毒素病，各地还有10％以上的三类苗生长较差。而少数干部和群众，却认为播种质量好和一般生长良好，有盲目乐观情绪，对田间管理有些放松。有的地方还没有建立起田间管理责任制，缺乏经常的管理。这些问题经检查提出，已引起各地注意。
    农业部根据这次检查，对当前越冬作物的田间管理问题作了一次研究。农业部认为，1958年小麦的田间管理是在返青后才大抓的，去年是返青前开始抓的。今年又提早了一步。当前是小麦等越冬作物扎根分蘖的关键时期，管好了就有利于返青和丰收。就这次检查看，各地越冬作物不论播种、质量或是田间管理，都比往年抓得早、抓得好，但是，绝不能满足已取得的成就，田间管理还大有文章好作，应乘胜前进，把田间管理抓到底。特别重要的是要加强对三类苗田的管理，提高三类苗，保证平衡增产。
    农业部认为：当前越冬作物的田间管理还应注意抓好以下几件事：
    首先，目前在少数干部和群众中产生有不同程度的盲目乐观情绪，这对进一步开展冬播作物田间管理很不利，必须及时纠正这种情绪。目前各地要抓紧时机，争取给越冬小麦、油菜、杂粮等作物普盖一层腊肥，壅根培土，保暖防冻，并防止生长过旺；争取把锈病、虫害等消灭在越冬阶段。最好提前在春节前就追施返青肥，到春节后小麦返青时，就能发挥肥效。南方各地还要注意开沟防涝；受旱地区要注意灌溉。油菜生产在农业生产中还是一个薄弱环节，因此，各地要特别注意把油菜田间管理抓好，做到种一亩收一亩，亩亩丰产，块块丰收。南方各地种植的越冬杂粮作物历年产量不高，当前应注意加强田间管理，力争提高单位面积产量。
    其次，各地要层层组织专业队伍，固定劳力，健全田间管理责任制和档案制，采取社干部包队，队干部包片，社员包田和定人、定田、定时间、定工分、定质量的办法，有了固定的劳力，又有了明确的责任制，才能保证田间管理的每项具体措施作得又快又细。
    第三，检查评比是领导农业生产的基本方法，要加强季节性的检查评比，推广先进经验，帮助落后单位赶上来，力求全面平衡跃进。江苏扬中县的办法就很好，值得各地学习。扬中县规定县每月检查一次，社每十天检查一次，队每五天检查一次，边检查边评比，还采取哪里先进，就到哪里开现场会介绍先进经验，哪里落后，就到哪里找原因，帮助落后赶上先进的。
    最后，农业部希望各地、各人民公社把越冬作物的管理，按作物生长的关键，持续地抓下去，不要放松。河北省安国县在大跃进中在管理麦田方面所提出的“大抓八个月、战斗十六节”的经验，值得各地推广。（附图片）
