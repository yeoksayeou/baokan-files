Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. To support agricultural technology transformation, scientific research units and relevant universities in Shanghai are accelerating scientific research in agricultural machinery, pesticides, fertilizers, and other fields.

The Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Research Institute, established in January of last year, has preliminarily trial-manufactured 23 types of agricultural machinery, including those for tillage, planting, fertilization, harvesting, and threshing. Many of these machines are designed to suit the paddy fields and vegetable plots of the South. For example, the suspended ditching and ridging machine is forty times more efficient than manual labor and can automatically adjust the width of the ridges and the depth of the ditches. A tractor-driven horizontal cultivating chisel has a tillage efficiency more than one hundred times that of manual labor.

Good agricultural machinery requires corresponding power. Technicians at the Shanghai Internal Combustion Engine Research Institute are cooperating with agricultural machinery professional organizations to accelerate the research of small diesel engines and various agricultural power machinery. In October of last year, they completed ahead of schedule the selection and standardization draft of diesel engines below 60 horsepower. The six series models they tentatively determined by integrating the advantages of various diesel engines are being circulated for opinions from various regions. In the fourth quarter of last year, this research institute also compiled in advance the illustrated catalog of vulnerable parts of the two most widely used diesel engines in rural areas, providing them to repair factories and qualified repair stations in rural areas to facilitate their own replacement of parts.

In terms of fertilizers, the Shanghai Chemical Industry Research Institute is implementing the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small scales. Based on China's resource situation, it is conducting a variety of research. The demonstration small nitrogen fertilizer plant designed and put into production by this research institute in 1958 can produce 8,000 tons of ammonium bicarbonate annually. Last year, it trained more than 2,300 related technicians and workers for various regions; currently, it is training technical cadres and workers needed for thirteen sets of synthetic ammonia plants with an annual output of 800 tons for Shanghai.

There has also been new development in pesticide research recently. Some researchers at the Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have successively screened more than 100 kinds of folk traditional pesticides last year. They found that traditional Chinese medicine and farmers often use garlic to treat diseases and kill insects (a sulfur compound). This ethyl allicin has been proven to have significant medicinal effects on wheat scab, cotton seedling diseases, and apple anthracnose when used in seed soaking and in large fields by the Department of Biology of Fudan University, the Shanghai Agricultural Experimental Institute, and other units.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. In order to comprehensively and rationally implement the "Eight-Character Charter" and increase the yield per unit area of ​​grain, cotton, and oil crops, the Hubei Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences has dispatched a large number of researchers to production teams in the main rice, wheat, cotton, and oil crop producing areas of Xiaogan, Jingzhou, and Xiangyang to establish more than ten scientific research base points. Combined with the masses, they seriously investigate and summarize the farmers' rich harvest experience. Researchers from the research institute stationed in the Suixian rice working group summarized and affirmed the fine varieties of indica rice cultivated by labor model Guan Kaishun, and carried out demonstrative promotion in the county. Last year, 50,000 mu were tested throughout the county, and a large area of ​​bumper harvest was obtained. The yield per mu was 80% higher than that of the local early indica rice, and the maturity period was also earlier than that of general early rice. Researchers from the research institute engaged in cotton research went deep into Mianyang, Tianmen, and Qianjiang and other places, together with local technical cadres and cotton planting experts, summarized a set of high-yield experience of cotton, such as timely early sowing, reasonable fertilization, and early mid-tillage, to produce more bolls and ensure three bolls (pre-summer bolls, summer bolls, and autumn bolls). After the promotion of these experiences, the number of summer bolls increased and boll rot and boll shedding were significantly reduced, and the yield per mu was about 10% higher than before.

In addition, researchers from the Institute of Microbiology of the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have focused on studying the soil microbial activity in deep plowing and fertilization of rice and wheat fields, so that microorganisms can better serve agricultural production. The Provincial Agricultural Society, Botanical Society, and Chemical and Chemical Engineering Society have established a soil pesticide identification committee to analyze and study more than 400 main soil pesticides in the province.

    上海湖北科学研究机关深入群众联系实际
    结合农业生产开展研究活动
    据新华社上海讯　上海科学研究单位和有关高等学校为了支援农业技术改造，正在加速进行有关农业机械、农药、化肥等方面的科学研究工作。
    去年1月间成立的上海农业机械研究所，一年来已经初步试制成功二十三项包括整地作业、种植、施肥、收割脱粒等的农业机械，其中很多机械是为适应南方水稻田及蔬菜地而设计的。如悬挂式开沟作畦机，功效比人工高四十倍，能自动调节畦的宽窄和沟的深浅；一种用拖拉机带动的卧式耕耘锄齿，整地效率比人工高一百倍以上。
    有了好的农业机械，还要有相适应的动力。上海内燃机研究所技术人员正在配合农业机械专业机构，加速进行小型柴油机和多种农用动力机械的研究工作。他们在去年10月间已经提前完成了六十马力以下柴油机的选型、定型系列化草案，他们综合各类柴油机的优点而初步定出的六种系列型号，正向各地征求意见。这个研究所在去年第四季度还提前编制出目前农村中使用最广的两种柴油机的易损零件的图册，提供各地修理厂及农村中有条件的修理站，便于他们自行配换零件。
    在化肥方面，上海化工研究院贯彻洋土并举和大中小结合的方针，根据我国资源情况，正在进行多种多样的研究。这个研究院在1958年设计成功并投入生产的示范性小氮肥厂，能年产八千吨碳酸氢铵，去年已为各地培养出二千三百多有关的技术人员和工人；目前正在为上海市培养十三套年产量八百吨合成氨工厂所需的技术干部和工人。
    关于农药的研究，最近也有新的发展。中国科学院有机化学研究所的部分研究人员去年先后对一百多种民间流传的土农药进行筛选。他们发现中医和农民常用大蒜治病和除虫（一种硫化合物）。这种乙基大蒜素经复旦大学生物系、上海农业试验所等单位在浸种和在大田中应用，证明对小麦赤霉病、棉花苗期病害及苹果炭疽病等有显著的药效。
    新华社武汉讯　为了全面合理地贯彻“八字宪法”，提高粮食、棉花和油料作物的单位面积产量，湖北省农业科学研究所抽出大批研究人员，到孝感、荆州、襄阳等主要的水稻、小麦、棉花和油料作物产区的生产队，建立了十多个科学研究基点，同群众结合，认真地考察和总结农民的丰产经验。这个研究所驻随县水稻工作组的研究人员，总结和肯定了劳动模范关开顺培育的大籼稻优良品种，并在县里进行了示范性的推广。去年，全县试种了五万亩，获得了大面积丰收，每亩产量比当地的早籼稻高出80％，成熟期也比一般早稻提早。这个研究所从事棉花方面的研究人员，深入到沔阳、天门和潜江等地，同当地的技术干部、植棉能手一起，总结了棉花的适期早播、合理施肥、提早中耕等一套多结伏桃、确保三桃（伏前桃、伏桃和秋桃）的丰产经验。这些经验推广后，使伏桃增加、烂铃掉铃显著减少，每亩产量要比原来增产一成左右。
    此外，中国科学院武汉分院微生物研究所的研究人员，着重地研究了水稻、小麦田深耕和施肥中土壤微生物活动情况，让微生物更好地为农业生产服务，省农学会、植物学会和化学化工学会专门成立土农药鉴定委员会，准备对全省四百多种主要土农药进行分析研究。
