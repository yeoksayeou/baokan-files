Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd. The good news of a successful start to industrial production has been continuously pouring in from Liaoning Province, one of China's industrial bases, these past two days. On New Year's Day and the 2nd, the output of steel, iron, coal, electricity, petroleum, light industry, textiles, and the volume of railway transport in the province all showed significant increases compared to the average daily production level of the fourth quarter of last year.

This year, the workers of Liaoning Province's industrial front continue to carry out technological innovation activities, with innovative examples emerging everywhere, breaking many historical records. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel's steel output on New Year's Day increased by 20% compared to the average daily output in the fourth quarter of last year, creating a historical record. Many factories in Shenyang's machinery industry, with a spirit of innovation, broke the conservative idea of not producing finished products at the beginning of the year, and assembled hundreds of various machines on the first working day.

The main reason why Liaoning Province's industrial production was able to achieve a successful start this year is that it fully and meticulously prepared a series of production preparations in the fourth quarter of last year. Leading cadres at all levels went deep into the front lines from the first shift of New Year's Day to participate in and lead production. At the same time, various factories carried out technical performance competitions and promoted the spirit of communist collaboration.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Workers on the capital's industrial front ushered in the New Year with joy and high spirits, striving for a successful start in each factory.

Steel production was victorious across the board on the 1st. The average daily output level of steel, pig iron, and steel products in the city all showed significant increases compared to December of last year. The Beijing West Mining Bureau's coal output on the 1st reached 24,369 tons, exceeding the plan by 7.1% and increasing by 10% compared to the average daily output in December, creating the highest daily output record in the bureau's history. The advanced collective of the Liulihe Cement Factory, which attended the National Congress of Heroes, continuously overfulfilled its plan on the 1st and 2nd.
