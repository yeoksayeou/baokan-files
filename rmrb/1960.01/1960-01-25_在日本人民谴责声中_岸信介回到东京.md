Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 24th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, who went to Washington to sign the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, returned to Tokyo today amidst condemnation and protests from the broad masses of people across the country.

Police authorities specially mobilized more than 500 armed police, heavily guarding the airport and the roads leading to Kishi Nobusuke's residence.

In a statement issued at the airport, Kishi Nobusuke defended the humiliating and nation-betraying Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty he signed. He also continued to advocate the "Cold War" theory: Although the tense situation between the East and West camps has "begun to show signs of easing," the offensive launched by so-called "totalitarian countries" "cannot be ignored."

    在日本人民谴责声中
    岸信介回到东京
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：去华盛顿签订侵略性的日美军事同盟条约的日本首相岸信介，今天在全国广大人民谴责抗议声中回到东京。
    警察当局特别为他出动了五百多名武装警察，在飞机场和通往岸信介住宅的路上森严戒备。
    岸信介在机场发表的一篇声明中，为他签订的丧权辱国的日美军事同盟条约辩解。他还继续鼓吹“冷战”说：东西方两个阵营之间的紧张局势虽然已经“开始出现缓和的征兆”，但是“不能忽视”所谓“极权国家”发动的攻势。
