Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 15th – According to a report from the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong: At a meeting of secretaries from both sides of the Korean Military Armistice Commission held today at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side, Colonel Kim Ja-bok, secretary of the Korean-Chinese side, protested the U.S. side's continued violations of the armistice agreement at the very beginning of the new year.

    The Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out that on January 9, 1960, at approximately 10:19 a.m. Korean time, a U.S. F86 military jet aircraft violated the armistice agreement by entering the airspace of the Korean-Chinese side's area, 18 kilometers north of the Military Demarcation Line.

    On January 7, a U.S. officer, leading ten U.S. armed personnel, launched smoke bombs and 196 rounds of bullets in the demilitarized zone, where any military action is prohibited, and conducted "military attack training."

    On January 5 and 7, U.S. civil police twice fired approximately 84 rounds of bullets from carbines, which are prohibited in the demilitarized zone, towards the Korean-Chinese side's area.

    Such blatant military actions by the U.S. in the demilitarized zone are a serious violation of the armistice agreement and the agreement between both sides of the Military Armistice Commission. The Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side demanded that the U.S. side punish those involved in the above incidents and that the U.S. side, in accordance with the armistice agreement, restrain its subordinate personnel and ensure strict compliance with the armistice agreement.

    Faced with the irrefutable facts presented by the Korean-Chinese side, the U.S. secretary was forced to admit the fact that a U.S. aircraft had intruded into the airspace of the Korean-Chinese side's area. He also promised to investigate the facts of conducting "military attack training" and firing automatic weapons in the demilitarized zone.

    The Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side demanded that the U.S. side take measures to ensure that such incidents do not occur again.

    朝鲜军事停战委员会双方秘书长举行会议
    我方抗议美方违反停战协定
    新华社平壤15日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面秘书长金自福上校今天在根据朝中方面建议举行的双方秘书长会议上，对美方在新年年初就继续违反停战协定的行为提出抗议。
    朝中方面秘书长指出，1960年1月9日，朝鲜时间十时十九分左右，美方F86军用喷气式飞机违反停战协定进入军事分界线以北十八公里的朝中方面地区上空。
    1月7日，美方军官一名率领美方武装人员十人，在禁止进行任何军事行动的非军事区内，发射了烟幕弹和一百九十六发枪弹，进行了“军事攻击训练”。
    在1月5日和7日，美方民政警察两次用在非军事区内禁止携带的卡宾枪向朝中方面地区发射了约八十四发枪弹。
    在非军事区内美方进行这种露骨的军事行动，是严重违反停战协定和军事停战委员会双方协议的行为。朝中方面秘书长要求美方惩处同上述事件有关的人员，要求美方根据停战协定约束所属部队人员，保证严格遵守停战协定。
    在朝中方面提出的无可争辩的事实面前，美方秘书长被迫承认了美方飞机一架侵入朝中方面地区上空的事实。他还答应要对在非军事区内进行“军事攻击训练”和发射自动武器的事实进行调查。
    朝中方面秘书长要求美方采取措施保证此类事件不再发生。
