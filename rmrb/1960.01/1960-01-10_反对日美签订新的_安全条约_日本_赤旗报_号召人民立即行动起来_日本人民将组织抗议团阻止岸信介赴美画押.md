Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th -- The National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in Japan decided today to hold a conference on the 14th to establish a protest group to oppose Nobusuke Kishi's trip to the United States to sign a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

　　Representatives from all walks of life, including labor unions, cultural circles, women, youth, and students, totaling approximately 2,000 people, will participate in the conference. On the 14th and 15th, protest letters will be delivered to Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and other representatives who will go to the United States to sign the treaty, as well as to the U.S. Embassy.

　　The National Conference decided that on the 16th, protest rallies will be held in various locations in Tokyo by region, followed by a large-scale protest rally at the Hibiya Park Open-Air Concert Hall.

　　The "Osaka Prefectural People's Joint Struggle Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" decided today to hold a rally of 15,000 people on the 14th, and to hold a demonstration in the city to oppose the signing of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." At the rally, 200 representatives will be sent off to Tokyo to protest Kishi's visit to the United States.

　　The Joint Struggle Conference also decided that on the 16th, when Kishi departs for the United States, twenty propaganda vehicles will be dispatched to distribute 500,000 leaflets in Osaka, calling on citizens to oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th -- The "Red Flag," the organ of the Japanese Communist Party, published an editorial today, calling on the people of all strata in Japan to organize large-scale mass political actions to protest Nobusuke Kishi's trip to the United States to sign the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

　　The editorial stated that the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty" has decided to hold the eleventh national unified action to oppose revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" from January 14th to 16th, and to launch continuous mass political actions throughout the country. Representatives from all over the country will gather in Tokyo on the 14th to hold a political rally. On the 16th, the day Kishi Nobusuke leaves Japan, a mass rally and demonstration will be held in Tokyo to protest Kishi Nobusuke's trip to the United States to sign the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

　　The newspaper stated that the Japanese Communist Party fully supports this struggle plan and will do everything possible to win the victory of the struggle.

　　The "Red Flag" emphasized that this struggle is the beginning of the national struggle of the Japanese people this year, and it is also a grand gathering in the new year for the struggle for independence and peace, so a comprehensive victory must be achieved, and it must become the starting point for future struggles.

　　The "Red Flag" called on workers, farmers, citizens, intellectuals, youth, students, and women to take immediate action, organize various forms of action, and strongly protest Nobusuke Kishi's trip to the United States to sign the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th -- An observer article titled "Dangerous Tricks of Japanese Revanchists" published in the Soviet "Pravda" today stated that Japanese reactionaries are desperately trying to form a new military alliance between Japan and the United States, which poses a threat not only to Japan but also to peace in the Far East.

　　The article pointed out that no matter how the Japanese reactionary ruling group tries to dress it up, the essence of the new U.S.-Japan security treaty cannot be concealed by anyone. Because no one is threatening Japan, and the Asian people also remember that the Japanese militarist group in the past always started its aggression by wantonly talking about "defense."

　　The article pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's recent speech in the Diet was actually a Cold War clamor, defending the arms race and turning Japan into an American atomic-rocket base. This activity of the Japanese reactionary ruling group is actually "inviting a wolf into the house," causing Japan to lose its national independence.

　　The article concluded that the behavior of the Japanese ruling group is inconsistent with the improvement of the international situation and is a threat to peace in the Far East, and therefore cannot but arouse the close attention of all peace-loving countries neighboring Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th -- According to TASS Moscow, 7th: "Izvestia" pointed out in an article published on the 7th that Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama and U.S. Ambassador to Japan MacArthur II held their final meeting in Tokyo on the 6th on the issue of revising the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi will take the new draft treaty to the United States for signing on January 16. The commentary said that behind these messages from Tokyo lies a dangerous decision by the Japanese government, which threatens Japan's national interests and the cause of peace in Asia.

　　"Izvestia" pointed out that the Japanese government's decision was made against the will of its own people, and that millions of Japanese people have long firmly opposed the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." No matter what beautiful coat is put on this treaty, the essence of this treaty remains: to tie Japan more tightly to the American chariot, to make Japan join a military bloc, and to maintain American military bases on Japanese territory.

　　"Izvestia" finally wrote that the task facing Japan is the same as the task facing all countries, namely, to make its own contribution to the easing of the international situation and the consolidation of world peace. However, the Japanese ruling group is doing the opposite, making its country more obedient to the dictates of American imperialism. Therefore, it bears a heavy responsibility to the Japanese people.

    日本人民将组织抗议团阻止岸信介赴美画押
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议今天决定在14日举行大会，成立抗议团，反对岸信介去美国签订新的日美“安全条约”。
    大会将有工会、文化界、妇女、青年、学生等各阶层人士的代表共约两千人参加。在14日和15日两天，将向日本首相岸信介和其他将到美国去签署条约的代表以及美国大使馆递交抗议书。
    国民会议决定，16日在东京各处将按地区举行抗议集会，然后在日比谷公园露天音乐堂举行大规模的抗议集会。
    “大阪府民阻止修改日美安全条约共同斗争会议”今天决定在14日举行一万五千人参加的奋起大会，并在市内举行示威游行，反对签订新的日美“安全条约”。在奋起大会上，将欢送二百名代表到东京抗议岸信介访问美国。
    共同斗争会议还决定，在岸信介启程访美的16日，要派出二十辆宣传车，在大阪市内散发五十万张传单，呼吁市民反对修改日美“安全条约”。
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日本各阶层人民组织声势浩大的群众性的政治行动，抗议岸信介到美国签订新的日美“安全条约”。
    社论说，阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议已经决定，从1月14日到16日举行第十一次反对修改日美“安全条约”全国统一行动，在全国各地连续展开群众性的政治行动。全国各地的代表将在14日汇集东京举行政治集会。在16日岸信介离开日本的当天，东京将举行群众大会和大示威游行，抗议岸信介到美国签订新的日美“安全条约”。
    报纸说，日本共产党完全支持这项斗争计划，并且将全力争取斗争的胜利。
    “赤旗报”强调指出，这次斗争是日本人民今年的全国性斗争的开始，也是为争取独立与和平的斗争在新的一年的一次大会师，因此必须取得全面的胜利，并且使它成为今后斗争的出发点。
    “赤旗报”号召工人、农民、市民、知识分子、青年、学生和妇女立即行动起来，组织各种形式的行动，强烈抗议岸信介到美国签订新的日美“安全条约”。
    据新华社莫斯科8日电　苏联“真理报”今天发表的一篇题为“日本复仇主义者的危险把戏”的观察家文章说，日本反动派正在拼命使日本同美国结成新的军事同盟，这一同盟不但对日本，而且对远东的和平都包藏着威胁。
    文章指出，不管日本反动统治集团如何打扮，新的美日安全条约的实质是谁也掩盖不住的。因为没有任何人在威胁日本，亚洲人民也还记得日本军国主义集团在过去也总是从妄谈“保卫”而开始侵略的。
    文章指出，岸信介不久前在国会的演说实际上是冷战叫嚣，是为军备竞赛和变日本为美国原子—火箭基地辩护。日本反动统治集团的这种活动实际上是“引狼入室”，致使日本失去国家的独立。
    文章最后说，日本统治集团的行为是与国际形势改善的情况不符的，是对远东和平的威胁，因此也就不能不引起与日本为邻的爱好和平的各国的密切注意。
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：“消息报”在7日发表的文章中指出，日本外务相藤山爱一郎和美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二6日在东京就修改日美安全条约问题举行了最后一次会晤，日本首相岸信介将于1月16日带着新条约草案前往美国签字。评论说，在这些来自东京的消息的背后，隐藏着日本政府的危险决定，这个决定威胁着日本的民族利益，也威胁着亚洲的和平事业。
    “消息报”指出，日本政府的决定是不顾本国人民的意志作出的，千千万万的日本人长期以来坚决地反对修改日美“安全条约”。不论给这个条约披上什么样的漂亮外衣，这个条约的实质仍然是：把日本更紧地绑在美国的战车上，使日本加入军事集团，以及在日本领土上保持美国军事基地。
      “消息报”最后写道，日本面临的任务同所有国家面临的任务一样，即为国际局势的缓和和促进世界和平的巩固作出自己的贡献。可是，日本统治集团与此相反，它使本国更加听从美帝国主义的摆布。因此，它对日本人民负有严重的责任。
