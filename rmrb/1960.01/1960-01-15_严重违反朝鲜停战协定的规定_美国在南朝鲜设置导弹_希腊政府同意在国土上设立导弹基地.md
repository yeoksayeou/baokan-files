Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 14th: Seoul dispatch: US Army Secretary Bruck arrived in South Korea on the 13th for activities. Bruck openly stated in Seoul that the United States is "very carefully studying the possibility of increasing the number of American soldiers in Korea." He also said that he would discuss with US Eighth Army Commander Magruder the issue of supplying new weapons to the Syngman Rhee clique.

The United States is currently actively engaged in nuclear arming in South Korea. According to an Associated Press report from Washington on the 13th, an atomic missile program to augment South Korea's "defense" system is likely to be announced in the coming weeks. The report revealed that in addition to the shipment of missiles, the US forces in South Korea already have several cannons and rockets that have been modified to use nuclear warheads.

Earlier, the US magazine "Newsweek" revealed that the United States had already deployed "Nike-Hercules" and "Hawk" missiles in South Korea.

The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today stating that this series of military provocations by US imperialism in South Korea is part of its efforts to create tension in the Far East. "All these facts prove that, under the situation where the power of the peace and socialist camp holds a decisive advantage, the Washington authorities have to talk glibly about 'peace,' but there is no change in their actual actions." "Peace-loving people do not listen to the words of the US ruling clique but watch its actions. People must never allow the US imperialist aggressive clique to resist the unanimous desire of mankind by intensifying war preparations to poison the international situation."

The commentary emphasized that the United States must withdraw all its aggressive troops from South Korea as soon as possible. The US aggressive clique must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from its criminal acts of grossly trampling on the Korean Armistice Agreement and increasing missiles in South Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th: TASS, Athens, 12th: Greek newspapers reported that Greece has agreed to establish a center on the island of Crete for training NATO officers to operate medium-range missiles.

These newspapers also said that, at the same time, Greece has decided to establish a medium-range missile base on the island of Crete.

    严重违反朝鲜停战协定的规定
    美国在南朝鲜设置导弹
    希腊政府同意在国土上设立导弹基地
    据新华社平壤14日电　汉城消息：美国陆军部长布鲁克13日到达南朝鲜活动。布鲁克在汉城公然说，美国正在“非常仔细地研究增加美国在朝鲜的士兵数目的可能性”。他还说，他将同美国第八军军长马格鲁德讨论把新武器供给李承晚集团的问题。
    美国目前正积极在南朝鲜进行核武装。据美联社13日华盛顿消息说，在今后几星期内可能将宣布为南朝鲜“防卫”系统增加原子导弹计划。消息透露，除了运入导弹外，美国在南朝鲜的军队已经有几种大炮和火箭经过改装而可以使用核弹头。
    早些时候，美国“新闻周刊”透露，美国已经在南朝鲜设置“奈克—赫尔克里士”式导弹和“隼”式导弹。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论说，美帝国主义在南朝鲜进行的这一系列军事挑衅是它在远东制造紧张局势的一部分。“这一切事实证明，华盛顿当局在和平和社会主义阵营威力占决定性优势的情况下，不得不侈谈‘和平’但在实际行动上却毫无变化。”“爱好和平的人民不是听美国统治集团的话，而是注视着他的行动。人们绝不能允许美帝国主义侵略集团抗拒人类一致的愿望加剧战争准备来毒化国际局势。”
    评论强调说，美国必须从南朝鲜早日全部撤走侵略军。美国侵略集团要对它粗暴蹂躏朝鲜停战协定、在南朝鲜增加导弹的犯罪行动所带来的一切后果负完全责任。
    新华社13日讯　塔斯社雅典12日讯：希腊报纸报道，希腊已经同意在希腊的克里特岛上建立一个训练北大西洋集团军官操纵中程导弹的中心。
    这些报纸还说，同时，希腊已决定在克里特岛上建立一个中程导弹基地。
