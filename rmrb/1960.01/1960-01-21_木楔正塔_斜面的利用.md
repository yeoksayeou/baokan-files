    Wooden Wedge Tower Correction
    ——Leveraging Inclined Planes
    Wang Xieshan
    In the Ming Dynasty, Xie Zhaozhe's notes "Five Miscellanies" included this story: "During the current dynasty, the Tiger Hill Pagoda in Suzhou was leaning. Discussions to correct it estimated a cost of no less than ten thousand strings of cash. A wandering monk saw this and said, 'There is no need for such expense; I can correct it.' Each day, he carried over a hundred wooden wedges, entered the pagoda through the doorway, and only the 'ding, ding' sound was heard. In less than a month, the pagoda was as straight as before, and no trace of the repair work could be found."
    This legend describing a wandering monk correcting a pagoda seems mysterious, but it is actually very scientific.
    Have you ever seen movers using ramps to push goods onto a truck? Perhaps you have participated in this kind of work, and you would have felt that pushing a heavy object up a ramp with an incline is less laborious than lifting the heavy object directly. This is because the "inclined plane" is helping you.
    When we directly lift a heavy object, we must overcome the entire weight of the object. When we push the object up along an inclined plane, relying on the supporting force of the inclined plane, it is as if part of the object's weight is being cancelled out. Therefore, the force we need to overcome is much smaller than the weight of the object. The smaller the slope of the inclined plane, the greater the weight the inclined plane can cancel out, and the less force we need to use.
    If we keep the heavy object stationary and make the inclined plane under the heavy object move towards the object, the heavy object can also be raised. At this time, the force used to push the inclined plane is also much smaller than the weight of the heavy object. This kind of inclined plane that is inserted under a heavy object during lifting is usually called a "wedge." There are many places where wedges are used! When we drive a pointed piece of wood under a heavy cabinet to lift it, we are using a wedge.
    The tool used by the wandering monk to correct the pagoda was precisely this kind of wooden wedge made using the principle of the inclined plane. The Tiger Hill Pagoda is a brick pagoda, so he naturally had the opportunity to find a gap on the leaning side and insert the pointed end of the wooden wedge to lift the leaning side. The "ding, ding" sound was naturally the sound of his labor as he hammered the wooden wedges. This sound is the sound of labor, but also the sound of wisdom, because the force he exerted while hammering the wooden wedges was not great. Of course, relying on one person's strength to lift a heavy brick pagoda is still an extremely difficult task. Therefore, the wisdom and hard work of this wandering monk—a Lu Ban-style craftsman—are extremely admirable.
    Inclined planes can not only be used directly for lifting, but some cranes—screw jacks—are also made using this principle. This type of crane is commonly known as a jack, and its main part—the thread on the screw—is an inclined plane, except that this inclined plane is coiled around a cylinder. When you use a screw to jack up a machine, you are essentially using a "coiled" wedge to lift the heavy object.

### 木楔正塔——斜面的利用

    木楔正塔
    ——斜面的利用
    王爕山
    明朝人谢肇淛的笔记“五杂组”中有这样一则故事：“国朝姑苏虎丘寺塔倾侧。议欲正之，非万缗不可。一游僧见之，曰：‘无烦也，我能正之’。每日独携木楔百余片，开户而入，但闻丁丁声。不月余，塔正如初，觅其补绽痕迹了不可得也”。
    这则描述游方僧正塔的传说，看起来似乎很玄妙，但实际上是很合乎科学的。
    你看到过搬运工人利用跳板把货物推上汽车吗？或许你参加过这种劳动，那你一定会感觉到沿着有斜坡的跳板推上一个重物比直接把重物举上去来得省力。因为这时“斜面”在帮助你。
    当我们直接把重物举起来的时候，我们要克服的是整个物体的重量；而当我们沿着斜面把物体推上去的时候，依靠着斜面的抵力，似把物体的重量抵消了一部分，因此我们要克服的力量就比物体的重量小得多。斜面的坡度越小，斜面的抵力能抵消的重量就越大，我们要用的力也就越小。
    如果我们让重物不动，而使重物下的斜面迎着重物运动，重物也同样能够升高。这时候所用的推动斜面的力量也同样比重物的重量小得多。这种在起重时插入重物底下运动的斜面，通常人们称它为“楔”。应用楔的地方可是不少！当我们把一块尖形的木块打入沉重的柜子底下，抬高柜子的时候，就是在利用楔。
    游方僧正塔所用的工具也正是这种应用斜面原理制成的木楔。虎丘寺塔是一座砖塔，他自然有机会在倾斜的一侧找到一处缝隙，把木楔尖的一头插入来抬高倾斜的一侧。这“丁、丁”之声自然就是他在打动木楔时劳动的声音，这种声音是劳动的声音，也是智慧的声音，因为他在打动木楔时所花的力量是不大的。当然依靠一个人的力量来抬高一座沉重的砖塔，这仍然是一件极为艰巨的难事。因此这位游方僧——鲁班式的工匠的智慧和辛勤的劳动就显得极其可敬了。
    斜面不但能直接用来起重，有种起重机——螺旋起重机也是利用它的原理制成的。这种起重机俗名千斤顶，它的主要部分——螺旋上的螺纹就是一个斜面，只不过这种斜面是盘旋在圆柱上的罢了。当你利用螺旋在顶起一架机器的时候，你等于是在用“盘旋的”楔块在把重物抬高。
