Editor's Note: In many areas, wheat growth has entered the tillering stage. Timely and vigorous efforts to improve field management, focusing on topdressing, is a very important task.

We must, like Xiangyang Prefecture, concentrate manpower and launch a mass movement to manage wheat fields on a large scale. The so-called vigorous and effective efforts require, first of all, leading cadres at all levels to take the lead, cultivate experimental fields, and set examples. Mere general appeals are unlikely to produce immediate results, and it will be impossible to create a vigorous mass movement.

Engaging in a large-scale mass movement has enabled Xiangyang Prefecture to accumulate sufficient fertilizer and reform a large number of tools, so that wheat field management has been carried out quickly and effectively.

(Our newspaper reports) Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Province has launched a mass movement for field management centered on topdressing. Approximately 820,000 laborers throughout the prefecture are engaged in field management, vigorously attacking the wheat seedling tillering stage. According to statistics as of January 7th, out of 13 million mu of wheat and miscellaneous grains, 11,346,000 mu had been weeded once, and 2,370,000 mu had been weeded twice; 9,538,000 mu had been topdressed, with an average of 64 dan of standard fertilizer applied per mu. Nine counties and cities, including Sui County, Zaoyang, Xiangyang, Guanghua, Gucheng, Jun County, Yun County, Baokang, and Xiangfan City, have basically completed the first weeding and first topdressing, and have begun the second weeding and second topdressing; other counties are also making great efforts to achieve this. In addition, great achievements have been made in clearing ditches and draining waterlogged areas, preventing pests and diseases, and preventing damage to crops by poultry and livestock, which has promoted the growth and development of wheat seedlings. Currently, wheat in general areas has tillered two or three stalks, with an average of more than 300,000 seedlings per mu.

One of the keys to Xiangyang Prefecture's success in launching a mass movement for field management is to correctly understand the situation and constantly boost morale. From the overall situation, the area of overwintering crops in Xiangyang Prefecture is large, planting is good, and growth is good, not only for wheat, but also for miscellaneous grains. Under this situation, there are two different views: one is that the area is large, the planting is good, and the growth is good, so strengthening management as soon as possible will make things even better, and a good harvest will be reliable. The other view is that the area is large, the planting is good, and the growth is good, so a good harvest is guaranteed. This is a complacent and paralyzed way of thinking, and in places with this kind of thinking, the progress of topdressing and weeding is slow. The prefectural party committee promptly criticized this erroneous thinking, organized cadres to go deep into the fields, inspect each plot, rank them, recall comparisons, calculate accounts in the fields, and carry out debates. Many vivid examples show that good planting must be followed by good management; with good management, third-class seedlings can become first-class seedlings, and without good management, first-class seedlings can become third-class seedlings. As the masses say: "Good planting and management ensure reliable harvests; neglecting management after planting breaks the golden bowl." Wheat field management is highly seasonal. The difference between topdressing and weeding in winter and topdressing and weeding in spring is very large. The masses say: "Scratching the surface in winter is better than plowing ten times in spring; topdressing one dan in winter is equivalent to topdressing two dan in spring." Winter is also the peak season for wheat tillering, so the prefectural party committee requires that two weedings and two topdressings be carried out before the Spring Festival, and a series of field management measures be strengthened to vigorously attack the wheat seedling tillering stage, with topdressing being the most important.

Another key to good field management is that the secretary takes the lead and the leadership takes the lead. All members of the Xiangyang County Party Committee and leaders at all levels set an example by participating in fertilizer delivery, which greatly encouraged the masses, thus launching a high tide of topdressing from top to bottom, from cities and towns to villages, as well as in government offices, troops, and schools. In order to balance fertilization and fertilize each plot, various localities have implemented the principle of fertilizing distant land before near land, sloping land before flat land, lean land before fertile land, and third-class seedlings before first-class seedlings. Sui County proposed the "Six Catch-ups" slogan of "Lean land catch up with fertile land, third-class catch up with first-class, distant land catch up with near land, hilly land catch up with plains, miscellaneous grains catch up with main grains, general fields catch up with experimental fields," and organized 140,000 laborers to topdress 1,540,000 mu in a short period of time, accounting for 84% of the total area, with an average of more than 80 dan per mu, and fully meeting the quality requirements. In terms of improving topdressing efficiency, in addition to vigorously promoting cart transportation to eliminate carrying by shoulder, the key is to focus on building fertilizer gravity irrigation stations. The district has built 5,396 fertilizer gravity irrigation stations, which have played a great role in topdressing. Stations can be built wherever there is running water, and the old habit of not topdressing sloping land in mountainous areas for many years has also been changed. Liming Production Team of Shangkan People's Commune in Fangxian County is a large mountainous area. The team topdressed 800 mu of the 1,300 mu of wheat. There were still 500 mu of sloping land that people could not carry fertilizer up to. In order to fertilize each plot, the masses shoveled turf and smoked fertilizer locally on the mountain ridges, totaling 25,000 dan, and applied a layer of fertilizer to all of them, averaging 50 dan per mu.

Vigorous topdressing promotes vigorous fertilizer accumulation. Accumulating while topdressing, and topdressing while accumulating, when the fertilizer in front of the house is used up, the masses will actively accumulate fertilizer. Taking the method of combining special teams for fertilizer accumulation and concentrated fertilizer accumulation, the speed of fertilizer accumulation has been accelerated. The district has accumulated 796,730,000 dan of fertilizer, accounting for 60% of the planned amount, and newly built 330,000 field manure pits. Places that originally shouted about a shortage of fertilizer quickly completed the fertilizer accumulation task.

While topdressing, weeding is also being done. Topdressing before weeding, and weeding while topdressing, so that topdressing and weeding are combined. In order to weed well and weed quickly, a mass tool reform movement was launched. The district has reformed more than 37,000 multi-tooth weeding tools, increasing work efficiency by several times or dozens of times. The ten-tooth hoe reformed by the Huopai People's Commune in Xiangyang can weed 60 mu per person per day, increasing work efficiency by 28 times, and the quality is also very good.

In order to thoroughly carry out field management, continuing to adhere to cadres cultivating experimental fields is an extremely important leadership method. According to incomplete statistics from the district, 147,000 cadres participated in cultivating experimental fields, totaling 150,000 mu of various experimental fields. Cadre experimental fields have powerfully promoted the field management movement centered on topdressing.

    种好管好丰收牢靠
    只种不管打破金碗
    襄阳专区以追肥为中心猛攻小麦分蘖关
    编者按：许多地区小麦生长已经进入分蘖期，及时狠抓、抓好以追肥为中心的田间管理，是一项十分重要的工作。
    必须像襄阳专区那样，集中人力，掀起大规模管理麦田的群众运动。所谓狠抓、抓好，首先需要各级领导干部带头干，搞好试验田，树立榜样；只有一般的号召，很难立竿见影，就不可能出现猛攻猛打的群众运动的局面。
    大搞群众运动，就使襄阳专区积足了肥料，改革了大量工具，麦田管理因此进行得又快又好。
    本报讯　湖北襄阳专区开展了以追肥为中心的田间管理的群众运动。全区投入田间管理的劳动力八十二万左右，猛攻麦苗分蘖关。至1月7日统计，一千三百万亩小麦和杂粮，其中已锄头道草的一千一百三十四万六千亩，已锄二道草的二百三十七万亩；追肥九百五十三万八千亩，每亩平均追标准肥六十四担。基本完成头道草、头道肥，并开始锄二道草、追二道肥的有：随县、枣阳、襄阳、光化、谷城、均县、郧县、保康、襄樊市等九个县、市；其余各县也正大力突击。另外，在清沟排渍，防治病虫害，防止家禽、家畜损害庄稼等方面，都取得了很大成就，促进了麦苗生长发育。目前一般地的麦子都分蘖两三根，每亩平均苗数一般在三十万株以上。
    襄阳专区大搞田间管理的群众运动的关键之一，就是要正确地认识形势，不断地鼓干劲。从总的情况来看，襄阳专区的越冬作物面积大，种的好，长的好，不仅小麦好，杂粮也好。在这种形势下，有两种不同的看法：一种认为面积大，种的好，长的好，尽快的加强管理，争取好上加好，丰收才牢靠。另一种认识是，面积大，种的好，长的好，丰收保险了。这是一种自满麻痹思想，有这种思想的地方，追肥、锄草进度就慢。地委及时批判了这种错误思想，组织干部，深入田间，块块检查，块块排队，回忆对比，田头算账，开展辩论。许多生动事例说明，种好必须管好，管得好三类苗会变成一类苗，管不好一类苗会变成三类苗。正如群众所说：“种好管好，丰收牢靠，只种不管，打破金碗。”麦田管理有强烈的季节性，冬天追肥锄草和春天追肥锄草相差很大，群众说：“冬天划个皮，强似春天犁十犁；冬天追一担，抵春天追肥两担。”冬天又是小麦分蘖的盛期，因此地委要求在春节前连锄两道草，连追两道肥，加强一系列的田间管理，猛攻麦苗分蘖关，其中以追肥最为紧要。
    搞好田间管理的另一关键是书记挂帅，领导带头。襄阳县全体县委委员和各级领导干部都以身作则参加送肥，对群众鼓舞很大，从而掀起了一个从上到下，从城镇到乡村，以及机关、部队、学校的追肥高潮。为了平衡施肥，块块施肥，各地实行了先远地后近地，先坡地后平地，先瘦地后肥地，先三类苗后一类苗的原则。随县提出了“瘦地赶肥地，三类赶一类，远地赶近地，岗地赶平原，杂粮赶主粮，一般田赶试验田”的“六赶”口号，组织十四万劳动力，在短短的时间内，已追肥一百五十四万亩，占总面积的84％，每亩平均达到八十多担，而且完全合乎质量要求。在提高追肥工效方面，除了大搞车子化消灭肩挑外，就是抓住大搞肥料自流灌溉站，全区已兴建起肥料自流灌溉站五千三百九十六个，在追肥方面发挥了很大作用。凡是有活水的地方都可以建站，在山区多少年来坡地不追肥的旧习惯也改变了。房县上龛人民公社黎明生产队是个大高山地区，全队小麦一千三百亩追肥八百亩，尚有五百亩坡地人挑不上去，为了块块施肥，群众在山梁子上就地铲草皮，就地熏肥二万五千担，全部都追了一层肥，每亩平均合五十担。
    大搞追肥，促进了大搞积肥，边追边积，边积边追，门前的肥用完了，群众就要积极积肥了。采取专班积肥和突击积肥相结合的办法，加快了积肥速度。全区已积肥七亿九千六百七十三万担，占计划数的60％，并新建田头粪凼三十三万个，原来叫喊缺肥的地方，也很快地完成了积肥任务。
    在追肥的同时，抓住锄草。先追肥后锄草，边追肥边锄草，使追肥锄草相结合。为了锄的好，锄的快，开展了群众性的工具改革运动。全区已改革多齿锄草工具三万七千多件，工效提高几倍、几十倍。襄阳伙牌人民公社改革的十齿锄，每张每天锄草六十亩，提高工效二十八倍，质量也很好。
    为深入地搞好田间管理，继续坚持干部搞试验田，是一个极为重要的领导方法。据全区不完全统计，参加搞试验田的干部达到十四万七千人，共搞各种试验田十五万亩。干部试验田，有力地推动了以追肥为中心的田间管理运动。
