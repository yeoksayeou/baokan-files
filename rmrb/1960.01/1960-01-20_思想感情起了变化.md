Ideological Feelings Have Changed
    Hu Xiaohai
    I am a new recruit on the literary and art front, an elementary school student. In studying Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," I deeply realized that what Chairman Mao said about literary and art workers having to go deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and having to go deep into practical struggle, is completely the truth. Now I am writing down my little bit of understanding, seeking criticism and correction.
    I am an intellectual from a petty-bourgeois background. In my hometown, I was considered the first "scholar" who didn't wear a square hat. In the past, I regarded the alienation of the working people towards me as "respect," and I was incompatible with them. After joining the revolution, the Party gave me my first lesson in labor. When I took off my socks and saw that my feet were white, I felt a little embarrassed. When I went to the fields, I would get nervous whenever people glanced at my feet. When I remembered that the peasants called the landlords "white-footed stems" (and called themselves "red-footed stems") during the land reform, I felt even worse. So, when working, I desperately tried to smear mud on my feet, and I didn't dare go to the river or pond to wash my feet when I got back, for fear that washing would reveal my true colors and be laughed at by the women. Only at this time did I truly feel the shame of not working; I felt that my thought of despising labor could only be truly transformed through labor.
    At the same time, only by participating in labor struggle can one truly see that there is still a long distance between one's own thoughts and feelings and those of the working people. If one does not make up one's mind to shorten and eliminate this distance, it is impossible to truly become one with the working people. When I was first sent down to the production team, I was still unaccustomed to and afraid of labor. Especially kneeling in the fields to weed and pull grass, with the sun beating down and leeches biting in the water, I really couldn't take it at first. At that time, the team was also in a competition with others, and everyone was anxious in the afternoon. (I was also anxious, but not in the same way as others!) At that time, the captain joked, saying that in order to complete the task ahead of schedule, he proposed to immediately send a woman back to twist a straw rope to tie the sun down, and asked if everyone agreed? At that time, I also chimed in with laughter and said I agreed, but in my heart I kept muttering, wishing the sun would fall down sooner...
    Before this, if someone had said that I lacked a labor concept, I would have jumped up and argued with him. But the facts showed that the working people regarded today's labor as a glorious right, while I regarded it as a burden, an unavoidable burden, and even had wavering thoughts. This alone is not the feeling of the working people. Only after being sent down did I slowly feel some changes. For example, I unconsciously began to cherish food; even when walking on the road, I developed feelings for the fields; and I felt like I had something to say even when I was with a stranger farmer. ...Only at this time did I begin to feel what Chairman Mao meant by "ideological feelings have changed;" I felt that if I wanted to shift from the position of a sympathizer of the working people to a true position of the working people, the only way was to listen to Chairman Mao's words: "Go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly." And to truly become a member of the working people, one must have the determination to be completely transformed. Otherwise, that "ideological remolding" will only ever be empty talk.
    A person's ideological position can only be truly tested in actual struggle.
    Without a correct position, one cannot correctly reflect life. Therefore, in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Chairman Mao first raised the issue of the position of literary and art workers.
    I used to lack a great deal of understanding of this point. In the past, when I went to the countryside, although I also participated in work, I also went to labor, to get close to the masses, but the purpose was to collect creative materials, and I did not think that the first thing was to transform my own position. Intellectuals are the easiest to forget about their own transformation, and they always cannot see the ugly and dirty things deep in their souls, and even want to beautify and embellish them everywhere. In the early summer of 1953, when I went to work in the countryside, I lived in an old farmer's house. One day, it rained heavily at night, and I just felt cool all over, and fell asleep soundly. But the old farmer quietly got up in the middle of the night and filled all the rice fields of the commune one by one. (If the fields were not filled with water, the rain would wash away the soil, and the roots of the seedlings would float up, causing great damage.) The next day, I learned about this incident and was very excited, and felt that I should reflect his model deeds in my works. However, at that time, I did not feel in the slightest that I was precisely an "opposite;" in front of him, I should first feel ashamed! At that time, I was most concerned about some linguistic details, not the thoughts and wishes of the masses; I was most worried not about whether the work was done well, but about whether I could find a good subject. I was half-hearted rather than wholehearted about the current struggle; my relationship with the masses was lukewarm rather than flesh-and-blood. At that time, "material" was also a "passerby" to me, not a "confidant;" you greeted it, but it did not pay attention to you.
    After being sent down, becoming a commune member, and serving as a grassroots cadre of the commune, I felt that the situation had begun to change. In the past, if I stayed in the countryside for a little longer, I would think about returning to the city to "adjust" my life; now, if I attended meetings in the city for a few days longer, I would worry about the production of the commune. For example, in the early days of the Great Leap Forward, a deputy director of the commune once had right-leaning conservative sentiments, and I was anxious. Because this deputy director was a production expert and a local expert, he had great prestige among the commune members. When the commune discussed and promoted the specifications for close planting of rice, he did not have to publicly oppose it. As long as he sat on the stage and did not speak, it would not be implemented among the masses (because he was the first to advocate close planting in the commune). In the past, I first thought about whether someone was a "typical" person, and whether I could get any "creative material" from him. In this way, I looked for "materials" all day long, but still felt that there was no material. Today, when I forget to look for material, the material comes to my door, and the deeper I go into life, the richer I feel. Especially the earth-shaking Great Leap Forward movement since 1958 has brought a relatively profound influence to my life, thought, and creation. I feel that in today's era of "six hundred million people are all Yao and Shun," there are too many good people and good subjects, which are really endless to talk about and write about! My mood is excited all the time. If this is what is called "passion," then it is not bestowed on me by some mysterious "angel of the soul," but brought about by the Party's General Line and the people's soaring spirit.
    Participating in labor and practical struggle has not only gradually transformed my non-proletarian thoughts, but also gradually transformed my empty intellectual language. In the past, when I came into contact with the working masses, there was not only a great distance in living habits and ideological feelings, but also in speech, it was like "Suzhou erhu and Cantonese opera," and it could not be put together. To become one with the masses, one must seriously learn their language. I feel that the language of the masses is indeed the most clear, the most vivid, the most simple, and the most imaginative. For example, we praise Chairman Mao as the savior of the people, but they say more vividly: "A golden bowl with a bottom, everyone who has turned over has a Chairman Mao in their heart!" I wrote a slogan on the wall for the commune: "Heroes are emerging everywhere today, everyone is like a living Wu Song." I felt pretty good about myself. But people said: "Everyone says he is like Wu Song, I am more heroic than Wu Song, Wu Song only beat one tiger, I captured nine dragons in the East Sea." The spirit is much greater than yours! From here, I deeply realized the importance of Chairman Mao's instruction that we should seriously learn the language of the masses. This should become a concrete content of our learning from the life of the people, and it is a very important lesson.
    Literary and art workers are sentinels on the revolutionary front. If they do not resolutely obey the leadership of the Party and do not resolutely fight against the influence of bourgeois ideology, they cannot complete their tasks.
    In 1954, the script "Two Brothers" that I practiced was first given a topic by the leadership, which greatly inspired me ideologically, and then completed under the direct leadership and help of the Party. From the creative process of this script, I deeply felt that if there had been no topic-setting and enlightenment from the Party committee leadership at that time, it would have been impossible for me to quickly refine and summarize some of my life feelings in the rural cooperative movement, and reflect them in a relatively hasty period of time.
    Later, the right-wing small group in Zhejiang's literary and art circles opposed the leadership of the Party, spread the influence of bourgeois ideology everywhere, and vigorously promoted "one bookism." Under the influence of this evil wind, the book "Two Brothers" became a progressive burden, weighing me down. When someone asked me: "After writing 'Two Brothers,' what will you write next?" I felt nervous and made up my mind to write something even better. At that time, I regarded creation as a personal career and personal success or failure, so I could not help but fall into personal distress. At the same time, the rightists opposed literature and art serving politics, and slandered the fallacy that works reflecting the current struggle were "propaganda" and could not withstand the test of time, which also affected me, making me even more confused, and made me doubt and waver about the "permanence" of the subject matter of my past works reflecting the reality of the struggle, thinking that the only "permanent" subject matter was to describe love life, and I felt that only plays like "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" were welcomed by everyone, old and young.
    The anti-rightist struggle made me open my eyes, draw a clear line, and made me realize the seriousness of transforming my position for literary and art workers. Only then did I make up my mind to move my family and settle down.
    In the two years since I was sent down, the earth-shaking Great Leap Forward movement has brought profound influences to my life, thought, and creation. It can truly be said that two years are better than eight years. In the past year or so, under the encouragement of the Party's General Line and the Great Leap Forward, I and my comrades have created six scripts reflecting the Great Leap Forward. These scripts were almost all written under the direct leadership of the Party committee and with the assistance of the masses. In particular, the opera script "Dou Shi Ting," which was recently created based on the four sisters of the Cixi cotton planting model He Qiao'e, received enthusiastic support from the local masses and the grassroots Party committee from the very beginning, and then received direct instructions and assistance from the grassroots Party committee to the county Party committee, the prefectural Party committee, and even the provincial Party committee. The fact that this script can be continuously improved in a short period of time and has been welcomed by the masses is the result of the direct leadership of the Party committee.
    Some people say that the direct leadership of the Party "interferes" with the freedom of writers. I don't know what this interference refers to. From my own personal experience, the so-called "interference" of the Party is nothing more than: requiring us to participate in labor and practical struggle; requiring us to obey the leadership of the grassroots Party committee; requiring us to study the Party's policies; requiring us to reflect the current real struggle; and requiring us to take the mass line in creation. The matter is very clear. Without these interferences, it would lead me to a path of accomplishing nothing.
    The education given to me by the Party and practical struggle has made me more deeply realize that participating in labor and practical struggle and combining with the masses is the only way for all literary and art workers to transform their thoughts and change their positions; the life of the people is the only source of all literature and art. And I have a clearer understanding that Chairman Mao's enthusiastic call for our literary and art workers to go deep into the life of workers, peasants, and soldiers is not only a matter of methods, but a very serious matter of principle; it is a fundamental issue of the two-line struggle in the literary and art circles; it is a question of whether to be a revolutionary proletarian literary and art worker or a bourgeois literary and art worker; it is a question of whether to be of one heart with the Party or of two hearts with the Party. Whether or not one is willing to go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, and to go to practical struggle, is a prerequisite for testing whether every literary and art worker is truly willing to transform his position and whether he is truly willing to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. There can be no ambiguity about this. I must listen to Chairman Mao's words, consciously and willingly go to the masses, go to labor, go to practical struggle to thoroughly transform myself, so that I can truly become a small soldier in the proletarian literary and art fighting team in the future.

    思想感情起了变化
    胡小孩
    我是文艺战线上的一个新兵，一个小学生。在学习毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中，深刻地体会到毛主席所说的文艺工作者一定要深入工农兵群众、一定要深入实际斗争的话，完全是真理。现在我把自己的点滴体会写出来，求得批评和指正。
    我是一个小资产阶级出身的知识分子，在家乡，我算是第一个不戴方巾的“秀才”。过去，我把劳动人民对我的隔膜看作是对我的“尊敬”，我和他们是格格不入的。参加革命后，党给我上了劳动的第一课。当我脱下袜子，一瞧自己的脚是白的，就觉得有点不好意思。下田时，只要人家看一眼我的脚，我就心跳，一想起土改时农民都喊地主是“白脚梗”（喊他们自己是“红脚梗”），心里更加不好受，于是干活时拼命想办法往脚上涂泥巴，回来也不敢到河塘边去洗脚，怕一洗露了原形，被妇女们看了耻笑。只有这个时候，我才真正感觉到不劳动的羞耻；感觉到自己轻视劳动的思想，只有在劳动中才能真正地得到改造。
    同时，只有参加了劳动斗争，才能真正地看出自己的思想感情和劳动人民的思想感情之间，还有着一段很长的距离。如果不下决心缩短和消灭这段距离，就不可能真正地和劳动人民打成一片。我刚下放到生产队的时候，对劳动还是不习惯的、害怕的。特别是跪在田里耘田拔草，头顶太阳晒，水里蚂蝗咬，开头实在有点吃不消。那时队里又正在和人家搞竞赛，干到下半天，大家心里都着急。（我也着急，不过跟人家急的不一样！）那时队长开玩笑地说：为了提前完成任务，他提议立刻派一个妇女回去搓一根稻草绳来，把太阳吊牢，问大家同意不同意？那时我嘴上也跟着嘻嘻哈哈叫同意，心里却不住嘀咕，巴不得太阳早点掉下去。……
    在这以前，如果有人说我缺乏劳动观念，我一定会跳起来跟他争辩。可是事实说明了，劳动人民把今天的劳动看作光荣的权利，而我却把它看作是不得已的负担，甚至产生过动摇。光这一点，就不是劳动人民的感情。只有在下放以后，我才慢慢地感觉到有了些变化，比如对粮食不知不觉地爱惜起来了；即使走在路上，也对田地产生了感情了；跟一个陌生的农民在一起，也觉得有话可说了。……也只有在这个时候，我才开始感觉到毛主席说的“思想感情起变化”是个什么意思；感觉到如果要从一个劳动人民的同情者的立场转变为一个真正的劳动人民的立场，唯一的道路就是听毛主席的话：“长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去”。而要真正成为劳动人民中的一员，就要有真正脱胎换骨的决心。不然，那“思想改造”就只能永远是一句空话。
    一个人的思想立场，只有到实际斗争中才能得到真正的考验。
    没有正确的立场，就不能正确地反映生活。所以毛主席在“延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中，首先就提出了文艺工作者的立场问题。
    关于这一条，我过去是十分缺乏认识的。从前我下乡去，虽然也参加工作，也去劳动，去接近群众，但目的是为了搜集创作材料，而没有想到首先是为了改造自己的立场。知识分子是最容易忘记对自己的改造的，总是看不见自己灵魂深处丑恶、肮脏的东西，甚至处处想美化、粉饰它们。1953年初夏，我去农村工作时住在一个老农家里。一天，夜里下了大雨，我只觉得浑身一阵凉快，就呼呼地睡着了。那个老农却半夜里悄悄爬起身来，把社里所有的秧田一丘丘都灌满了水。（如果不把田水灌满，大雨一淋，秧根就会浮起，造成很大损失。）第二天，我知道了这件事，心里非常激动，觉得应该把他的模范事迹用作品反映出来。但是，当时我竟丝毫也没有感觉到，自己恰恰就是个“对立面”；在他面前，我首先应该感到羞耻！那时节，我最关心的是一些语言细节，而不是群众的思想和愿望；我最担心的不是怕工作搞不好，而是怕找不到好题材。对当前的斗争，我是半心半意而不是全心全意的；和群众的关系是若即若离而不是血肉相连的。那时候，“材料”对我来说也是个“过路客人”，而不是“知心朋友”；你向它打招呼，它也不来理睬你。
    下放以后，当了社员，做了社的基层干部，我觉得情况开始有了些改变，过去在乡下多呆了一会，就想着回城里来“调剂调剂”生活；如今在城里多开了几天会，就惦记着社里的生产了。又比如大跃进初期，社里有个副主任一度产生了右倾保守情绪，我心里就着急。因为这个副主任是个生产能手、土专家，在社员中很有威信，社里讨论推广水稻密植规格时，他不必公开出来反对，只要坐在台上不说话，在群众中就贯彻不下去（因为社里当初搞密植，就是他首先提倡的）。过去，我首先想到的是某人是不是个“典型”人物，从他身上能不能搞到什么“创作材料”。这样，一天到晚找“材料”，还是觉得没材料。今天当自己忘记了找材料的时候，材料却自己送上门来，生活越深入就越觉得丰富。特别是1958年以来翻天复地的大跃进运动，给我的生活、思想和创作都带来了较为深刻的影响，感觉到在今天这个“六亿神州尽舜尧”的时代里，好人物、好题材实在太多了，真是说不完写不尽！心情每时每刻都很激动。如果说这就是什么“激情”的话，那它并不是什么神秘的“心灵的天使”赏赐给我的，而是党的总路线和人民的冲天干劲所带来的。
    参加劳动和实际斗争，不仅逐渐地改造了自己的非无产阶级思想，也逐渐地改造了自己空洞的知识分子语言。过去和劳动群众接触，不但在生活习惯和思想感情上还有一段很大的距离，说起话来也是“苏州胡琴广东戏”，凑合不到一起。要和群众打成一片，就非得认真地学习他们的语言不可。我觉得，群众的语言的确是最明朗、最生动、最朴素又是最富于想像力的。比如我们歌颂毛主席是人民的救星，他们却更生动地说：“一只金碗一个底，翻身人心里人人都有个毛主席！”我给社里写墙头标语，写的是：“今天到处出英雄，人人赛似活武松。”自己觉得蛮不错了。可是人家却说：“人人都说赛武松，我比武松更英雄，武松只打一只虎，我擒东海九条龙。”气魄比你大的多！从这里，使我深深地体会到毛主席指示我们要认真地向群众语言学习的重要性。这应该成为我们向人民生活学习的一个具体内容，这是一门很重要的功课。
    文艺工作者是革命战线上的哨兵，如果不坚决地服从党的领导，不坚决地和资产阶级思想影响作斗争，就不可能完成任务。
    1954年，我习作的剧本《两兄弟》就是领导上先给我点了题，使我在思想上得到很大的启发，然后在党的直接领导和帮助下创作完成的。从这个剧本的创作过程中，我深刻地感觉到，当时如果没有党委领导的点题和启发，我是不可能把自己在农村合作化运动中的一些生活感受予以很快的提炼和概括，并且在比较仓促的时间内反映出来的。
    后来，浙江文艺界右派小集团，反对党的领导，到处散布资产阶级思想影响，大肆宣扬“一本书主义”。在这股歪风的影响之下，一本《两兄弟》变成了进步的包袱，把我自己压的喘不过气来。当有人问起我：“写了《两兄弟》，下面再写个什么呀？”我就感到紧张，下定决心，想写出个更好的来。那时我把创作看成了个人的事业、个人的成败，于是就不能不陷入了个人苦闷。同时，右派分子反对文艺为政治服务，污蔑反映当前斗争的作品都是“宣传品”，经不起时间的考验的谬论也影响了我，使我更加模糊了起来，对自己过去所描写的反映现实斗争的作品题材的“永久性”产生了怀疑和动摇，认为唯一的“永久性”的题材，就是描写爱情生活，觉得只有像《梁山伯与祝英台》这样的戏，才是妇孺老幼人人欢迎。
    反右派斗争使我擦亮了眼睛，划清了界线，使我认识到改造立场对于文艺工作者的严重性。这才下定决心，搬家落户。
    下放两年来，翻天复地的大跃进运动给我的生活、思想和创作都带来了深刻的影响，真正可以说是：两年胜过八年。一年多来，在党的总路线和大跃进的鼓舞下，我和同志们一起创作了六个反映大跃进的剧本。这些剧本，差不多都是在党委的直接领导和群众的协助下写成的。特别是最近创作的一个以慈溪植棉模范何巧娥四姊妹做底子的戏曲剧本《斗诗亭》，一开始就得到了当地群众和基层党委的热情支持，以后又从基层党委到县委、地委一直到省委，都得到了直接的指示和帮助。这个剧本能在短短的时间内得到不断的提高，获得了群众的欢迎，就是党委直接领导的结果。
    有人说，党的直接领导“干涉”了作家的自由。我不知道这干涉指的是什么。以我自己的切身体会来说，所谓党的“干涉”无非是：要我们参加劳动、参加实际斗争；要我们服从基层党委的领导；要我们学习党的方针政策；要我们反映当前的现实斗争；要我们在创作上走群众路线。事情很清楚，如果没有这些干涉的话，那就会使我走上一条一事无成的道路。
    党和实际斗争给我的教育，使我更深刻地体会到：参加劳动和实际斗争，和群众相结合，是一切文艺工作者改造思想改变立场的唯一道路；人民生活是一切文学艺术的唯一源泉。并且更清楚地认识到：毛主席要我们文艺工作者深入工农兵生活的热情号召，不仅是方式方法的问题，而是一个十分严肃的原则问题；是文艺界两条道路斗争的根本问题；是做革命的无产阶级文艺家，还是做资产阶级文艺家的问题；是跟党一条心，还是跟党两条心的问题。愿不愿长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到实际斗争中去，是考验每一个文艺工作者是否真正愿意改造自己的立场、是否真正愿意为工农兵服务的先决条件。这是一点也不能含糊的。我一定要听毛主席的话，自觉自愿地到群众中去，到劳动中去，到实际斗争中去彻底地改造自己，使自己在将来能真正成为无产阶级文艺战斗队伍里的一个小兵。
