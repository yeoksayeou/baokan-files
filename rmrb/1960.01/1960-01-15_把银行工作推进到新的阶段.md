    Push Bank Work to a New Stage
    Ma Mingfang
    Our banking work has achieved great success in the glorious ten years since the founding of the country. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the achievements have been even more remarkable. Through the planned adjustment of currency circulation and credit and settlement work, the bank has supported industrial and agricultural production, supported the expansion of commodity circulation and the stability of the market, and has done a great deal of mass work. Banking work has formed a considerable scale of mass movement in many aspects, and it is continuing to develop. In the movement, many red flag units, many advanced collectives and advanced workers have emerged. In many places, the mass movement of banking work is combined with the mass movement of production links and commodity circulation links. It can be seen that banking work will, on the basis of continuing to deeply mobilize the masses, enter a situation with richer economic and political content and a more magnificent scale of mass movement.
    In order to adapt to the development of this great situation, further improve the banking work in the future, and better serve the high-speed development of socialist construction, I would like to talk about three aspects here and study them with comrades.
      (1) Further cooperate with all parties to pro-
    mote the high-speed development of the national economy and organize
    the people's economic life well
    The People's Bank is the general bookkeeper, general cashier, and general accounting agency of the entire national economy. It plays an important role in the development of the national economy and the improvement of the people's economic life. In the past ten years since the founding of the country, even tracing back to the struggle to build and develop the liberated areas before the national liberation, the bank has done a fairly outstanding job. In the long period to come, the bank will continue to play a more important role and do more work. Our work is just the beginning, and more arduous work is yet to come.
    According to its nature and role, banking work is inherently closely linked to industrial and agricultural production, transportation, commodity circulation, the entire national economy, and the people's economic life. The fundamental task of banking work is to promote the development of industrial and agricultural production, promote the expansion of commodity circulation, and promote the high-speed development of the entire national economy in accordance with the Party's general line and a set of "walking on two legs" policies through managing currency, organizing and allocating funds. Correctly and planned management and allocation of funds (working capital), and organization of the use of funds can better promote production development, promote the expansion of commodity circulation and other undertakings; when production develops, commodity circulation expands, and other undertakings are done well, it in turn opens up sources of funds and increases capital accumulation, and the bank then organizes these funds and uses them to expand reproduction and develop the economy. In this cycle, we can constantly support production through the allocation and activity of funds, and increase capital accumulation through the development of production. This is the correct path of banking work.
    The bank manages monetary funds, but it does not directly use the money for production or commodity circulation; production units and commodity circulation units directly use the credit funds borrowed from the bank for agricultural production processes; industrial production processes and commodity circulation processes; that is, production units use the money to purchase raw materials, commercial units use the money to purchase goods, etc. Therefore, the bank must manage the money well. On the one hand, it must coordinate the overall situation, take care of the upper and lower levels and the left and right sides, and rationally adjust and allocate funds within the scope of a commune, an enterprise, a county, a province, and the entire country; on the other hand, it must help communes, production teams, factories, mines, shops, and other money-using units to manage and use the money well. The proper management and use of money by units that directly use money is the basis for the bank to do a good job in fund management. Therefore, banks and money-using units must establish close cooperative relationships and do a good job in fund management under the guidance of the highly socialist cooperative political ideology. From the perspective of their respective divisions of labor and responsibilities, banks and money-using units are different, but from the perspective of managing and using funds well, they are consistent. The relationship between banks and all money-using units must be a close cooperative relationship. The basic content of this cooperative relationship is to jointly manage and use funds well to achieve the purpose of developing production and accelerating socialist construction. Managing and using funds well and developing production at a high speed and doing a good job in all undertakings are mutually reinforcing. The proper management and use of money by money-using units and the development of production and the proper handling of undertakings by these units themselves are two aspects of the same thing. Banks, enterprises, and institutions must truly establish this common view.
    Banking comrades must go deep into factories, workshops, shops, people's communes, and production teams, familiarize themselves with production and funding needs, actively assist in doing a good job in production planning, arrange funds, materials, and labor, and open up production avenues; at the same time, assist enterprises and people's communes in establishing and improving fund management systems and financial management systems, strengthen economic accounting, practice thrift, reduce costs, reduce fund backlog, and accelerate fund turnover, so as to achieve the goal of both doing a good job in production and circulation and doing a good job in fund management. This is the work spirit and work method that socialist banking workers must have. We often say that saving the use of funds is not unilaterally for the sake of using a few less dollars, but to fully tap the potential of materials, avoid the backlog of materials, and fully tap the potential of funds, and avoid the backlog of funds. And fully tapping the potential of materials and funds will greatly help to unleash labor potential, promote people's enthusiasm and creativity, and improve labor efficiency.
    Organizing the people and enterprises, institutions, and organizations to deposit temporarily unused money in the bank is an important aspect of banking work in organizing and adjusting funds, supporting production and construction, and stabilizing the market. Deposit savings work should not only provide the masses with the convenience of depositing and withdrawing money as much as possible, but more importantly, through organizing deposits and savings, arranging and organizing the economic life of the people, going deep into every household, carrying out publicity and education on building the country and managing the family diligently and thriftily, carrying out ideological education on socialism and patriotism, helping them to calculate carefully, arrange their living expenses, and voluntarily store the money that is temporarily not used. This part of the stored money can not only solve the needs of the state, groups, and individuals in production at any time, but also solve the needs of the people's lives at any time. In this way, savings work is combined with socialist ideological education, combined with national construction, and combined with the production and life of the people. This is a political ideological work, and it is also an economic work related to production and people's lives. In some places, banks, together with relevant units, help the masses to run various welfare undertakings and living service undertakings, and the masses feel that it is both economical and convenient, which is also a very good thing. At present, we have tens of thousands of savings offices in cities, nearly one hundred thousand agency offices and service stations, and 350,000 to 400,000 assistant savers; in rural areas, there are nearly 200,000 credit branches, 770,000 service stations, and 1.9 million assistant savers. It can be said that we have initially established a huge mass financial work network in urban and rural areas. This financial work network is also a political work and mass work network.
      (2) Continuously guide the mass movement for-
    ward, establish more red flags, and continue to develop
    the mass line working method
    The Great Leap Forward and large-scale mass movements are closely linked. Revolutionary struggle must engage in mass movements, and economic construction must also engage in mass movements. In the past, without large-scale mass movements, we could not have overthrown the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and won the victory of the democratic revolution; now, without large-scale mass movements, we cannot continue to win the victory of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Marxists and proletarian revolutionaries always regard mass movements as the normal order of social revolution and social construction. When mass movements arise, things are very good, full of vitality, and magnificent, and many things that were previously unimaginable and impossible to do can be done.
    In the past, some people doubted whether banking work should engage in mass movements? Can we engage in mass movements? This doubt is unfounded. For us communists, as long as there are people, we should carry out mass work and engage in mass movements, but the methods adopted by mass movements, the scale and content they have, are different. There are mass movements in factories and people's communes, and there are also mass movements in organs. Isn't the promotion of advanced bill counting technology to bring general technology up to the advanced level also a mass movement? Without the active efforts of cadres and workers, without the enthusiasm of nearly two million assistant savers in rural areas and three to four hundred thousand assistant savers in urban areas, without the cooperation of enterprises and people's communes, without the combination of internal mass movements and external mass movements, banking work could not be done well. The position of banking work in the national economy determines that the mass movement of banking work must be closely combined with the mass movements of industry, agriculture, commerce and other aspects at various periods, and cannot be separated. The mass movement of banking work is a component of the national movement to increase production and practice economy, and it is a component of the mass movement in socialist construction.
    Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the leadership of banks at all levels has become more in-depth in the mass movement, the slogans and goals of mobilizing the masses have become more clear and specific, and the ideological mobilization of workers and the cooperation with all parties have also been grasped more tightly, so in many places the momentum of the mass movement is relatively large. We should continue to make the mass movement of banking work wave after wave and continue to develop forward. At present, we should quickly shift the movement to supporting the rural "Five Winters" movement (winter plowing, water conservancy construction, soil improvement, fertilizer accumulation, and field management) and supporting the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year, immediately following the agricultural product purchase movement.
    The advanced collectives and advanced workers who emerged in the large-scale mass movement last year are all flags and models in all aspects of banking work. In the future, we will continue to establish more red flags and produce more advanced collectives and advanced figures. Our red flag movement is a movement to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward. It is a socialist competition, evaluation, observation, mutual assistance, and mutual promotion mass movement. Through the red flag movement, widely cultivate and establish advanced collectives and advanced figures, so that all aspects are full of vitality and spring is in the world. Advanced collectives and advanced workers should drive the general and bring the general level and the ordinary level to the advanced level, and universalize and socialize the advanced level; so that the level that only a few people and a few units reached at the beginning can be transformed into a social level and have universality through our efforts. When our advanced work experience is widely promoted, the entire banking work will be promoted to a new stage of development. While the advanced level under certain historical conditions is transformed into a social level, new and higher advanced levels will continue to emerge, and these new and higher levels will then lead and promote the general level to catch up with their own level. In this way, we will advance all aspects of work, and push the wheel of society and history forward. This is the concrete embodiment of the Marxist theory of continuous revolution in our work. Advanced collectives and advanced workers are shouldering such a great and glorious historical task. Advanced units and advanced workers can only help others advance in order to make themselves constantly advanced, and the greater the benefits and the faster the progress of the people who are helped, the greater the benefits and the faster the progress of the people who help others.
      (3) Rely closely on the leadership of the Party, go deep
    into the general line education, continue to carry out
    the study movement, and vigorously cultivate more both red and
    expert cadres
    Putting politics in command and the leadership of the Party are the fundamental guarantees of the Great Leap Forward. The Great Leap Forward is the victory of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and economical results. We must comprehensively and resolutely implement the Party's general line of socialist construction. We must continue to educate workers in the general line of socialist construction, so that cadres and workers can further improve their socialist awareness, overcome various forms of bourgeois right-leaning ideology, continue to go all out, and forge ahead bravely, so that all comrades can constantly improve their political and ideological level and become brave fighters to defend the Party's general line and brave fighters for socialist construction.
    We are carrying out the great cause of building socialism. The cause of socialist construction requires thousands of both red and expert cadres. In the past two years, the workload of the bank has increased greatly, but the number of cadres has not increased, but has decreased a little, but the bank's work is still done very well. This is because the political awareness and business technology level of the comrades in the bank have been improved, that is, they have made great progress on the road of being both red and expert. The bank has carried out many technical reforms in accounting, cashier and other business operations, and many people have made significant improvements in business operation technology. It is not an easy thing for one person to count 18,000 to 20,000 bills per hour with only two hands. In terms of technological innovation, it can also be seen that the liberated Chinese people are able to highly display their genius, wisdom and pioneering spirit. People carry out technological innovation, and technological innovation in turn liberates people's thinking and increases people's intelligence.
    Banking business is related to all aspects, so bank cadres should not only be proficient in their own business, but also be familiar with and study the business knowledge of relevant aspects. Comrades in banking work should also further familiarize themselves with and study the current economic and political situation, and familiarize themselves with and study the relevant business policies. In this way, we can have a relatively comprehensive and objective understanding and handling of various problems in our work, and we can do things better. Planned and continuous investigation and research is the best way to achieve these desires.
    Red and expert are two categories, but they are unified and integrated. The combination of red and expert is the combination of politics and business. Politics is the commander, and the continuous improvement of political level can make business research better, and can make us become sound socialist experts and experts in socialist financial work.
    In order to cultivate more both red and expert cadres, we must organize cadres and workers to study. Some people can study off-the-job, and the vast majority of people study on-the-job. Running red and expert schools, night schools, spare-time schools, correspondence schools, organizing business instructors, and itinerant teaching are all good ways to organize cadres to study. What to learn? Learn culture, learn theory, learn business technology. We must make the vast number of workers and cadres in our banks at all levels strive to reach the level of elementary school, junior high school, high school, and university respectively within one or two years, or two or three years. Leading cadres should pay more attention to studying theory, first of all studying Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's works are the theory summed up based on the experience of our Chinese revolution, the theory of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, the development of Marxism-Leninism, and the pointer for the Chinese revolution to go from victory to victory. Leading cadres above the county level should systematically study Chairman Mao's works, study Chairman Mao's theory, and study Chairman Mao's position, viewpoints, and methods of observing, understanding, and solving problems. Theory is a factor that plays a long-term role in work. Learning should be planned, organized, and measured. Without a set of specific organizational work, it may fall through. Learning should be combined with practice. After learning for a period of time, summarize it, and then learn again after summarizing it. This is a more practical method. With the great leap forward in all aspects of work, there should also be a great leap forward in learning.

    把银行工作推进到新的阶段
    马明方
    我们的银行工作，在建国以来辉煌的十年间，取得了很大成绩。1958年大跃进以来，成绩更加显著。银行通过有计划的调剂货币流通和信贷、结算工作，支援了工农业生产，支援了商品流通的扩大和市场的稳定，并且做了巨大的群众工作。银行工作在许多方面已经形成了相当规模的群众运动，目前正在继续发展。运动中间出现了许多红旗单位、许多先进集体和先进工作者。很多地方银行工作的群众运动同生产环节、商品流通环节的群众运动结合起来了。可以看出，银行工作将要在继续深入发动群众的基础上，进到一个经济内容和政治内容更加丰富、群众运动规模更加宏伟的局面。
    为了适应这个大好形势的发展，进一步做好今后的银行工作，更好地为社会主义建设事业高速度发展服务，在这里谈谈三个方面的问题，和同志们共同研究。
      （一）进一步同各方面协作，促
    进国民经济高速度发展，组织好
    人民经济生活
    人民银行是整个国民经济的总簿记、总出纳、总核算机关。它对于国民经济的发展，对于人民经济生活的改善，起着重要的作用。建国十年来，甚至可以追溯到全国解放以前在建设和发展解放区的斗争中，银行都做出了相当出色的工作。在今后长时期中，银行将要继续起更重要的作用，做更多的工作。我们的工作只是刚刚开头，更繁重的工作还在后面。
    银行工作按照它的性质和作用说来，本来就是同工农业生产、同交通运输、同商品流通、同整个国民经济和人民经济生活密切联结着的。银行工作的根本任务，就是按照党的总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针，通过管理货币，组织和分配资金去促进工农业生产的发展，促进商品流通的扩大，促进整个国民经济高速度的发展。正确地有计划地管理和分配好资金（流动资金），组织好资金的使用，就能够更好地促进生产发展、促进商品流通和其他事业的扩大；生产发展了，商品流通扩大了，其他事业办好了，反过来又开辟资金的来源，增加资金的积累，银行再把这些资金组织起来，用于扩大再生产、发展经济。如此循环往复，就可以不断地通过资金的分配和活动去支援生产，通过生产的发展去增加资金积累，这就是银行工作的正确道路。
    银行是管理货币资金的，但是，它不直接把钱使用于生产或者商品流通上面；生产单位，商品流通单位则是把从银行贷来的信贷资金直接用于农业生产过程；工业生产过程以及商品流通过程；即生产单位把钱用于购买原料、材料，商业单位把钱用于收购商品等等。所以银行要把钱管好，一方面必须在一个公社、一个企业、一个县、一个省的范围内，在全国范围内，统筹全局，照顾上下左右，合理调节和分配资金；另一方面，又必须帮助公社、生产队、工厂、矿山、商店等用钱单位把钱管好、用好。直接用钱的单位把钱管好、用好，是银行做好资金管理工作的基础。因此，银行和用钱单位之间，要建立密切的协作关系，在高度的社会主义协作的政治思想指导下，做好资金管理工作。银行和用钱单位从各自的分工和承担的职责说来，是有分别的，但是，从要把资金管好、用好说来，则是一致的。银行和一切用钱单位的关系，必须是密切协作的关系，这种协作关系的基本内容是共同把资金管好、用好，达到发展生产，加速社会主义建设的目的。把资金管好、用好，和高速度的发展生产、办好一切事业，是相辅相成的。用钱单位把钱管好、用好，同这些单位本身发展生产、办好事业，是一件事情的两个方面。银行和企业、事业单位必须确实树立这种共同观点。
    银行工作同志，必须深入到工厂、车间、商店、人民公社和生产队，熟悉生产及资金需要情况，积极协助做好生产规划，安排好资金、物资和劳动力，打开生产门路；同时协助企业和人民公社建立和健全资金管理制度和财务管理制度，加强经济核算，厉行节约，降低成本，减少资金积压，加速资金周转，以达到既搞好生产和流通，又搞好资金管理的目的。这就是社会主义银行工作者必须具有的工作精神和工作方法。我们常说节约使用资金，并不是片面地为了少用几个钱，而是要充分挖掘物资的潜力，避免物资的积压，要充分挖掘资金的潜力，避免资金的积压。而充分挖掘物资和资金的潜力，就大有助于发挥劳动潜力，发扬人们的积极性和创造性，提高劳动效率。
    组织人民群众和企业、机关、团体把暂时不使用的钱储存到银行里来，这是银行工作组织和调节资金，支援生产建设，稳定市场的一个重要方面。存款储蓄工作不但要尽量给群众以存款取款的方便，更重要的是通过组织存款和储蓄，安排和组织人民群众的经济生活，深入到每家每户，进行勤俭建国和勤俭持家的宣传教育，进行社会主义和爱国主义的思想教育，帮助他们精打细算，把生活开支安排好，自愿地把暂时不使用的钱储存起来。这部分储存起来的钱，既可以随时解决国家、团体、个人生产上的需要，又可以随时解决人民群众生活上的需要。这样就把储蓄工作同社会主义思想教育结合起来，同国家建设结合起来，同人民群众的生产、生活结合起来。这是一项政治思想工作，又是一项同生产、同人民生活有关系的经济工作。有些地方的银行同有关单位一起，帮助群众自办各种福利事业和生活服务事业，群众觉得既节约又方便，这也是很好的事。目前我们在城市有上万个储蓄所，有近十万个代办所和服务站，有三十五万至四十万个协储员；在农村有近二十万个信用分部，有七十七万个服务站，一百九十万个协储员。可以说，我们在城市和乡村已经初步建立起来一个巨大的群众性的金融工作网。这个金融工作网，同时又是一个政治工作和群众工作网。
      （二）不间断地引导群众运动前
    进，树立更多的红旗，继续发展
    群众路线的工作方法
    大跃进和大搞群众运动是密切联结着的。革命斗争必须搞群众运动，经济建设也必须搞群众运动。过去没有大规模的群众运动，我们就不可能推翻国民党的反动统治，取得民主革命的胜利；现在没有大规模的群众运动，我们也不可能继续取得社会主义革命和社会主义建设的胜利。马克思主义者、无产阶级革命家，总是把群众运动看作是社会革命和社会建设的正常秩序。群众运动起来了，事情就好得很，生气勃勃，气势磅礴，许多过去想不到、办不到的事情，都办得到了。
    过去曾经有人怀疑银行工作应该不应该搞群众运动？能不能搞群众运动？这种怀疑是没有根据的。对于我们共产党人说来，只要有人的地方就应该进行群众工作，就可以搞群众运动，不过群众运动所采取的方式、所具有的规模和内容有所不同罢了。工厂、人民公社里有群众运动，机关里面也有群众运动，像推广先进的点票子技术，使一般技术赶上先进水平，不也是群众运动吗？没有干部和职工群众积极努力，没有农村近两百万协储员和城市三四十万协储员的积极性，没有企业、人民公社的协作，没有内部的群众运动和外部的群众运动的结合，银行工作就不可能做好。银行工作在国民经济中所处的地位，决定了银行工作的群众运动必须同工业、农业、商业等方面各个时期的群众运动紧紧地结合起来，而不能分割开来。银行工作的群众运动是全国增产节约运动的一个组成部分，是社会主义建设中群众运动的一个组成部分。
    在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，各级银行对群众运动的领导更加深入了，动员群众的口号和奋斗目标更加明确具体了，对职工的思想发动工作以及同各方面的协作也抓得比较紧了，因而在许多地方群众运动的声势就比较大。我们应当继续使银行工作的群众运动一浪赶一浪，不断地向前发展。目前，应当紧接着农产品收购运动之后，迅速使运动转入支援农村“五冬”运动（冬耕、兴修水利、改良土壤、积肥、田间管理）和支援今年工农业生产的继续跃进方面去。
    在去年大搞群众运动中涌现出来的先进集体和先进工作者，都是银行工作各方面的旗帜和榜样，在今后要求继续树立起更多的红旗，出现更多的先进集体和先进人物。我们的红旗运动，是一种比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进的运动，是一种社会主义的竞赛、评比、观摩、互相帮助、互相促进的群众运动。通过红旗运动，广泛地培养和树立先进集体和先进人物，使各个方面都万紫千红，春到人间。先进集体和先进工作者要去带动一般，把一般的水平、普通的水平带动和提升到先进的水平，把先进水平普遍化、社会化；使开始还只是少数人、少数单位达到的水平，经过我们的努力，转化为社会的水平，具有普遍性。当我们的先进工作经验普遍推广起来的时候，整个银行工作就会被推进到一个新的发展阶段。在一定历史条件下的先进水平转化为社会水平的同时，新的更高的先进水平又会不断地出现，而这些新的更高的水平再带领和推动一般水平赶上自己的水平。我们就这样把各方面的工作，把社会和历史的车轮推向前进。这就是马克思主义的不断革命论在我们工作中的具体体现。先进集体和先进工作者就是承担着这样一个伟大而光荣的历史任务。先进单位和先进工作者只有帮助别人先进，才能使自己不断先进，而被帮助的人得到益处越大、进步越快，帮助人的人得到的益处也就越大、进步也越快。
      （三）紧紧依靠党的领导，深入
    进行总路线的教育，继续开展学
    习运动，大力培养更多的又红又
    专的干部
    政治挂帅，党的领导，是大跃进的根本保证。大跃进就是党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的胜利。我们要全面地、坚决地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设的总路线。我们要继续在职工中进行社会主义建设总路线的教育，使干部和职工进一步提高社会主义觉悟，克服各种形式的资产阶级右倾思想，继续鼓足干劲，奋勇前进，使所有的同志，不断地提高自己的政治思想水平，成为保卫党的总路线的勇敢战士，社会主义建设的勇敢战士。
    我们正在进行建设社会主义的伟大事业。社会主义建设事业，需要千千万万又红又专的干部。两年来，银行的工作量有很大的增加，干部却没有增加，还减少了一点，但是银行的工作仍然做得很好。这是由于银行工作的同志们政治觉悟水平提高了，业务技术提高了，也就是在又红又专的道路上大大前进了一步。银行在会计、出纳等各项业务操作上进行了许多技术改革，许多人在业务操作技术上都有显著的提高。一个人只凭两只手，一小时点一万八千到两万张票子是一件不容易的事情。在技术革新方面，也可以看出，解放了的中国人民，是能够高度地发挥自己的天才、智慧和首创精神的。人们进行技术革新，而技术革新又反过来解放人们的思想，增长人们的聪明才智。
    银行业务与各方面都有联系，所以银行干部除精通本身的业务之外，还要熟悉和研究有关方面的业务知识。银行工作的同志还应当进一步熟悉和研究当前的经济形势和政治形势，熟悉和研究有关业务的方针政策。这样，就使我们有可能比较全面地客观地认识和处理工作中的各项问题，就使我们有可能把事情办得更好些。有计划地持续地进行调查研究是实现这些愿望的最好办法。
    红与专是两个范畴，但又是统一的、互相结合的。红与专的结合就是政治和业务的结合。政治是统帅，政治水平不断的提高，才能使业务钻研得更好，才能使我们成为健全的社会主义的专家，成为社会主义的金融工作专家。
    为了培养更多的又红又专的干部，就要组织干部和职工的学习。一部分人可以离职学习，绝大部分人则在职学习。办红专学校、夜校、业余学校、函授学校、组织业务辅导员、巡回教学等等，都是组织干部学习的好办法。学什么？学文化，学理论，学业务技术。务使我们各级银行的广大职工和干部，努力争取在一二年、二三年内，分别达到小学、初中、高中、大学程度。领导干部要更多地注意学习理论，首先是学习毛主席的著作。毛主席的著作是根据我们中国革命的经验总结起来的理论，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的理论，是马克思列宁主义的发展，是中国革命从胜利走向胜利的指针。县以上的领导干部都应当系统地学习毛主席的著作，学习毛主席的理论，学习毛主席观察、认识问题和解决问题的立场、观点、方法。理论是在工作中长期起作用的因素。学习要有计划，有组织，有措施，没有一套具体的组织工作，就可能落空。学习要和实际相结合，学习一段，总结一下，总结了之后再学习，这是个比较实际的方法。各项工作大跃进，学习也要来个大跃进。
