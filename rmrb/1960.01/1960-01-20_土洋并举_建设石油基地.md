Promoting Both Indigenous and Foreign Methods to Build a Petroleum Base
Guo Jiusheng, Deputy Director of the Qinghai Petroleum Administration

"One year for exploration, two years for drilling, three years for oil production, four years for refining, five years to find an oil sea, and six years for a major transformation." This is a true description by the staff of the Qinghai Petroleum Administration of the high-speed development of the Qaidam petroleum industry.

Since the start of the Qaidam petroleum geological survey in 1954, it has entered a new stage after only a few short years. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the LengHu No. 5 oil field, with its shallow oil layers, high quality, and large output, was discovered. In the first half of 1959 alone, nearly a hundred production wells were drilled in LengHu, quickly bringing the daily crude oil production capacity to over 1,600 tons. At the same time, it produced hundreds of thousands of tons of crude oil for the country, and the various petroleum products refined have begun to supply the Qinghai and Tibet regions. Now, the Qaidam petroleum industry has developed into a joint enterprise with drilling, oil extraction, and refining. The LengHu No. 5 oil field has been built into a modern petroleum industrial base of considerable scale in what was once a desolate Gobi desert.

The high-speed development of the Qaidam petroleum industry is a victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction and a victory for the Party's complete set of "walking on two legs" policies.

The Qaidam Basin is vast and has very complex geological structures. In addition, it is far from the mainland, has no residents, and has relatively poor natural conditions. To develop the petroleum industry in such an area, we need to actively rely on foreign aid on the one hand, and rely more on self-reliance on the other. We must use foreign methods, but also use indigenous methods.

According to the experience stated in books, petroleum exploration has a strict scientific procedure and method. If we mechanically follow the procedures and methods in the books, it will inevitably drag out the exploration and development time, which is not only inconsistent with the spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction, but also not allowed by the current situation. Therefore, in 1958, under the principle of both breaking superstitions and respecting science, we adopted the method of "casting a wide net, blooming everywhere, drilling both large and small wells together, and grasping both deep and shallow oil layers" to drill in thirty-nine structures within the 140,000 square kilometer area. At that time, this method was criticized by some people with right-leaning thoughts. However, under the leadership of the Party, the staff of the entire bureau resolutely implemented the "walking on two legs" policy of promoting both indigenous and foreign methods. As a result, in just one year, five oil fields with industrial value and three gas fields were found, and oil and gas shows were seen in twenty structures, with a success rate of 85% for drilled structures. These facts eloquently demonstrate that so-called irregular "indigenous" methods can also find oil fields.

Regarding the types of drilling rigs used, some people used to think that light drilling rigs could only be used to explore strata and lithology, and completely looked down on small drilling rigs and small oil fields. In 1958, we made full use of the light and fast characteristics of light drilling rigs, "flying all over the sky" and "drilling everywhere," achieving great results. Of the thirteen oil and gas fields discovered so far, eleven were found using light drilling rigs.

Promoting both indigenous and foreign production methods, with self-reliance as the main focus and foreign aid as a supplement, is of great significance to the high-speed development of the Qaidam petroleum industry. We rely on the masses, do it ourselves, and adopt methods that are tailored to local conditions, simple and crude, and use local materials. Indigenous methods are put into operation first, then foreign methods, or indigenous methods are combined with foreign methods, achieving the effects of short time and quick results. For example, in the upsurge of everyone engaging in indigenous oil refining in 1958, hundreds of small refining pots were set up throughout the bureau in just a few days. On the basis of the mass movement of indigenous oil refining, we explored the experience of foreign oil refining and cultivated a technical team for oil refining, creating conditions for more standardized oil refining. At the Youshashan exploration area, they started refining oil using gasoline barrels as refining pots, and some people said, "It won't work!" The workers said, "It will work!" As a result, the staff built an indigenous oil refinery with an annual processing capacity of 30,000 tons of crude oil on the basis of the indigenous refining pots. Then, using old scrap materials, they built a foreign oil refinery with an annual processing capacity of 30,000 tons of crude oil, and in 1959, they built a new oil refinery with an annual processing capacity of 50,000 tons of crude oil. It can be said with certainty that without the foundation of mass indigenous oil refining, it would have been impossible to build these indigenous, foreign, and indigenous-foreign combined oil refineries in just two or three months.

In actively developing the petroleum industry, we have also launched an upsurge in developing diversified operations and running auxiliary production factories on a large scale. Currently, the staff have used the rich resources of Qaidam to set up more than a dozen auxiliary factories and mines, such as barite powder, cement, refractory bricks, and ceramics. At the same time, they have used reeds and soil to build more than 100,000 square meters of houses. In addition, we have also carried out fishing, hunting, reclamation, vegetable cultivation, pig raising, sheep raising, and wild animal breeding. This has not only solved the difficulties of raw materials in production in a timely manner and improved the lives of the staff, but also greatly reduced exploration costs and production costs.

The production and construction of the Qaidam petroleum base has already achieved great results. But it can only be said to be the first step in a long march. In the future, we will hold even higher the red flag of the Party's general line, exert all our energy, and complete and overfulfill the tasks assigned to us by the state in a faster, better, and more economical way, so that the Qaidam petroleum industry can leap forward again and again!

    土洋并举　建设石油基地
    青海石油管理局副局长　郭究圣
    “一年勘探二年钻，三年出油四年炼，五年找到石油海，六年形势大转变。”这是青海石油管理局职工对柴达木石油工业高速度发展的真实描述。
    从1954年柴达木石油地质普查工作开始以来，只经过短短的几年，现在已进入了一个新阶段。经过1958年的大跃进，找到了油层浅、质量高、产量大的冷湖五号油田。1959年半年多的时间内，在冷湖就钻了近百口生产井，很快地使原油日产能力达到一千六百吨以上，同时为国家生产了数十万吨原油，炼出的各种石油产品已开始供应青海、西藏地区。现在，柴达木石油工业已发展成为一个拥有钻井、采油、炼油等多工种的联合企业。冷湖五号油田在过去一片荒凉的戈壁滩上建成为一个初具规模的现代化石油工业基地。
    柴达木石油工业高速度的发展，是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是党的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针的胜利。
    柴达木盆地幅员广阔，地质构造情况非常复杂；加以这里距内地较远，没有居民，自然条件也比较差。要在这样的地区发展石油工业，就需要我们一方面积极依靠外援，同时更要自力更生；既要使用洋办法，更要使用土办法。
    按照书本上所说的经验，石油勘探有一套严密的科学程序和方法。如果我们机械地照书本上的程序和方法进行，势必使勘探、开采的时间拖得很长，这不仅和党的社会主义建设总路线的精神不相符合，也是当前形势所不容许的。因此，1958年我们在既要破除迷信又要尊重科学的原则下，采取了“撒开大网，遍地开花，大钻小钻一齐上，深浅油层一起抓”的办法，在十四万平方公里范围内的三十九个构造上进行钻探。当时这个办法曾遭到一些有右倾思想的人的非难。但是全局职工在党的领导下，坚决贯彻执行了土洋并举的“两条腿走路”的方针，结果在短短的一年内，就找到了具有工业价值的油田五个，汽田三个，在二十个构造上都见到了油气显示，钻探构造的成功率达到85％。这些事实雄辩地说明，采用所谓不正规的“土”法同样可以找到油田。
    在使用钻机的类型上，过去有些人认为轻便钻机只能用来探地层、岩性，根本看不起小钻机、小油田。1958年，我们充分利用了轻便钻机轻便、快速的特点，“满天飞”、“到处钻”，取得很大成果。目前已发现的十三个油气田中，就有十一个是用轻便钻机找到的。
    土法生产和洋法生产并举，以自力更生为主依靠外援为辅，对柴达木石油工业的高速度发展有着极为重大的意义。我们依靠群众，自己动手，采用因地制宜、因陋就简、就地取材的办法，土法先上马，先土后洋，土中出洋或土洋并举，收到了时间短、见效快的效果。如在1958年人人动手大搞土法炼油的热潮中，在短短的几天中全局就支起了几百个小炼锅。在土法炼油的群众运动基础上，我们摸索出洋法炼油的经验，培养出一支炼油的技术队伍，为比较正规的炼油创造了条件。油沙山探区开始用汽油桶当炼锅炼油，有人说：“不行！”。工人却说：“行！”结果职工们就在土炼锅的基础上建成了年可处理原油三万吨的土法炼油厂。接着又利用旧废料建成了年处理原油三万吨的洋法炼油厂，1959年又建成了一个年处理原油五万吨的新炼油厂。可以肯定地说，没有群众性的土法炼油的基础，决不可能在短短的两三个月内建成这些土的、洋的和土洋结合的炼油厂。
    我们在积极发展石油工业中，还掀起了发展多种经营、大办附属辅助生产工厂的热潮。目前，职工们利用柴达木的丰富资源，已办起了重晶石粉、水泥、耐火砖、陶瓷等十几种附属厂矿；同时就地取材用芦苇和土盖起了十几万平方米的房屋。此外，我们还进行了捕鱼、打猎、开荒、种菜、养猪、养羊和养野牲等工作。这不仅及时解决了生产上的原材料困难和改善了职工生活，并且大大降低了勘探费用和生产成本。
    柴达木石油基地的生产建设已经取得了很大的成绩。但只能说是万里长征第一步，我们今后将更高地举起党的总路线的红旗，鼓足干劲，多快好省地完成和超额完成国家交给我们的任务，使柴达木石油工业跃进再跃进！（附图片）
