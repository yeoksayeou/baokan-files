Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: The Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, which proposed a comprehensive leap forward initiative to brother enterprises across the country, is holding high the red flag of the General Line, continuing to vigorously promote mass movements, greatly promoting technical innovation, and doing everything possible to realize the conditions of the initiative. The entire factory has seen an excellent situation of sustained and comprehensive leap forward in production.

From the first day of production on the 2nd to the 9th, the factory overfulfilled its planned output value and production every day, and the product quality and variety also fully met the planned requirements, while also achieving safe production. Cumulatively for eight days, the output of electronic tubes exceeded the first ten-day plan by 25%, accounting for 39.7% of the monthly plan, an increase of 35% compared to the same period in December last year; the output value exceeded the first ten-day plan by 58%, accounting for 50.8% of the monthly plan, an increase of 34% compared to the same period in December last year.

On the basis of full preparations in terms of ideology, materials, and technology last year, the factory saw a vigorous upsurge in mass movements right from the start of this year. From top to bottom, from production workers to office cadres, and even the cooks in the canteen and the nannies in the nursery, everyone worked closely together and acted in unison to complete the daily production plan. Everyone was full of vigor and strove to be the best.

In the past week, technical innovation stories have emerged every day; according to incomplete statistics, the factory has now realized more than forty major technical innovations. On the first day of production, Zhang Minru, a planer in the 204 workshop of the Equipment Branch, improved the operating method. When making the clamp for the ultra-small glass shell manufacturing machine, she changed from planing forgings one by one to planing the whole material and then milling it. As a result, she completed thirty-two hours of work in eight hours, increasing efficiency threefold. Gao Shuying, a planer on the third shift, immediately learned from Zhang Minru's advanced experience and increased the cutting depth. As a result, she completed forty-two hours of work in six hours, increasing efficiency sixfold.

The reason why the factory's production can continue to leap forward comprehensively is that, in addition to the good preparatory work done before the New Year, the main reason is that the production plans for the first quarter, January, and each day of January are assigned to units, processes, and individuals at all levels, so that every worker not only knows their daily production task, but also knows the production tasks of other workers whose processes are connected to theirs, achieving "five clarifications" of goals, key points, measures, progress, and division of labor. Therefore, it promoted the enthusiasm of workers to complete the daily plan. In terms of the organization and leadership of production, the factory also adopted a series of down-to-earth measures: First, the completion of the production plan is checked every day and every shift, not only checking the quantity, but also checking the quality and variety, and organizing forces to solve problems in a concentrated way when problems are found. Second, we must firmly grasp the balance and cooperation between the various processes to achieve a tight connection between each link. Third, special personnel are assigned to key problems and weak links to be on duty and responsible for supervision and inspection. Fourth, basic-level leaders of branches and workshops take turns to be on duty. Every day, day and night, all three shifts have leading cadres and workers carrying out production together. This has played a great role in solving problems in a timely manner and boosting the morale of workers.

### 大闹技术革新  持续全面跃进  北京电子管厂超额完成上旬计划

    大闹技术革新  持续全面跃进
    北京电子管厂超额完成上旬计划
    据新华社11日讯　向全国兄弟企业职工提出全面跃进倡议的北京电子管厂，高举总路线红旗，继续大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新，千方百计实现倡议条件，全厂出现了生产持续全面跃进的大好局面。
    这个工厂2日第一天生产至9日，产值、产量天天超额完成计划，产品质量和品种也全部达到计划要求，并且做到了安全生产。八天累计，电子管产量超额25％完成了上旬计划，占月计划的39．7％，比去年12月同期增长35％；产值超额58％完成了上旬计划，占月计划的50．8％，比去年12月同期增长34％。
    在去年进行了思想、物质、技术等各方面充分准备的基础上，这个工厂今年一开始就出现了轰轰烈烈的群众运动高潮。全厂从上到下，从生产工人到科室干部，直到食堂的炊事员和托儿所的保育员，为了完成每天的生产计划，密切协作，统一行动，人人意气风发，个个力争上游。
    一周来，每天都有技术革新事迹出现；据不完全统计，现在全厂共实现了四十多项重大的技术革新。开门生产第一天，设备分厂二○四车间的中班刨工张敏如就改进了操作方法。她在做超小型玻壳制造机的夹钳时，将原来用锻件一个一个地刨，改为整料刨了以后再铣切，结果八小时就完成了三十二小时的工作量，提高效率三倍。三班刨工高书英一上班马上学习张敏如的先进经验，并加大吃刀量，结果六小时干完了四十二小时的活，效率提高了六倍。
    这个工厂生产能够持续全面跃进，除了年前的准备工作作得好，主要原因是把第一季度、1月份和1月份每一天的生产计划，按单位、工序、个人层层下达，使每个工人不但知道自己每天的生产任务，而且知道与自己工序相衔接的别的工人的生产任务，作到目标、关键、措施、进度、分工“五明确”。因此，促进了工人完成当日计划的积极性。在生产的组织领导上，全厂也采取了一系列踏踏实实的措施：第一，天天班班检查生产计划完成情况，不仅检查数量，还检查质量和品种，发现问题组织力量突击解决。第二，狠抓各个工序之间的平衡和协作，做到了一环紧扣一环。第三，对关键问题和薄弱环节，设专人顶班，负责督促检查。第四，分厂、车间的基层领导干部轮流值班。每天日夜三班都有领导干部和工人们一起进行生产。这对及时解决问题和鼓舞工人的干劲起了很大作用。
