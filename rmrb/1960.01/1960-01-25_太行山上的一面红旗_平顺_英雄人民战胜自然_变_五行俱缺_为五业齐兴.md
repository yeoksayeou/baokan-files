    A Red Flag on the Taihang Mountains—Pingshun
    Heroic People Conquer Nature, Transforming "Lacking All Five Elements" into Thriving in All Sectors
    (Our Dispatch) The diligent and courageous people of Pingshun, Shanxi, under the leadership of the Party and relying on the strength of the people's communes, waged a tenacious struggle against various natural disasters in 1959, achieving an all-around bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.
    The county's total grain acreage is 200,000 mu, with an average yield of 402.5 jin per mu, an increase of 26.1% compared to 1958, achieving the targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule. In the past, Pingshun County needed the state to supply about 4 to 5 million jin of grain annually. In 1959, in addition to meeting the county's needs for food, fodder, and seeds, it also sold more than 10 million jin of grain to the state. Diversified economic activities have also achieved unprecedented development. The afforestation area increased by 27.2% compared to 1958, with an average of 7.6 mu of forest slope per person, more than 1,600 timber trees, and more than 260 fruit trees. Animal husbandry, mainly pig raising, has also developed rapidly. In this county of only 30,000 households, there are more than 40,000 pigs, 150,000 sheep, and more than 16,000 head of large livestock. Compared with 1958, pig numbers increased by 34%, sheep by 18%, and mules and horses by 32%. Sideline production has greatly developed, with the establishment of various workshops, and sideline income increased by 64% compared to 1958. Fishery production has also begun to develop.
    In the past year, according to the characteristics of Pingshun, 68 various factories and mines have been established in accordance with local conditions. Now, every commune has established agricultural machinery repair, fertilizer, agricultural and sideline product processing, building materials, and manufacturing factories, and eleven communes and management districts have established power stations. The annual industrial output value reached 3.16 million yuan, an increase of 1.1 times compared to 1958. In the past year, these factories manufactured and improved more than 250,000 pieces of various agricultural implements and manufactured more than 4,500 tons of chemical fertilizers. The transportation industry has also developed accordingly. In this "uneven and unsmooth" mountainous area with blocked transportation, 221 kilometers of highways, 125 kilometers of large cart roads, and more than 2,800 kilometers of general cart roads and camel transport roads have been built. Rubber-tired carts, flatbed carts, and iron-wheeled carts transport local agricultural products to the cities day and night, bringing large quantities of industrial daily necessities to the mountainous areas.
    With the comprehensive development of production, the people's economic life has also undergone tremendous changes. The total income of the county reached 12.97 million yuan, an increase of 40.3% compared to 1958. The average income per person was 108 yuan, an increase of 46% compared to 1958; more than 95% of the commune members increased their income.
    The people of Pingshun attribute the all-around bumper harvest on all fronts in 1959 to the people's communes. In this year, the people's communes conscientiously implemented the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture and waged a tenacious struggle against natural disasters. At the beginning of last year, the county Party committee mobilized the people of the county to organize large-scale operations and launched a deep plowing campaign, with deep plowing reaching 70% of the total cultivated land. Fertilizer application averaged 160 dan per mu. The amount of sowing was increased by 20% to 30% compared to the past, achieving rational close planting, ensuring full and vigorous seedlings. In the summer, when various crops were heading, they suffered a seventy-two-day "bottleneck" drought, followed by three major wind disasters, seven hail disasters, and eight insect disasters. But these disasters could not scare the heroic people. Under the leadership of the county Party committee, they organized an army of 50,000 to 60,000 people to fight the drought, making full use of the existing water conservancy projects, lifting water to irrigate seedlings, diverting water to irrigate the land, overcoming the drought, and ensuring a bumper harvest.
    Thirty to fifty percent of the cadres of county-level organs often work in rural areas, factories, and mines, achieving leadership in every line, troops on every road, and comprehensive advancement in all industries. A mass "Learn from Tianzhu, catch up with Jiangkao, everyone red, diligent, clever, everywhere catch up and surpass" labor emulation campaign was launched throughout the county, and a large number of individual and collective pace-setters emerged, with more than 30,000 red, diligent, and clever activists. In 1959, the people of the county contributed a total of 12.79 million workdays, an increase of 47% compared to the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The average production value per workday was 1.22 yuan, an increase of 27% compared to 1958.
    The goals for 1960 are: to increase the unit area yield of grain to 500 jin, with a total county output of 100 million jin; to afforest 150,000 mu, plant 100 million trees, cultivate 30,000 mu of orchards, reaching ten mu of forest and three thousand trees per person, and one mu of orchard per household; to comprehensively develop animal husbandry, raising 260,000 pigs, achieving one pig per mu, 9,000 head of large livestock, and 250,000 sheep; and to achieve a sideline production income of 5 million yuan.
    In 1960, 73 new and expanded factories and mines will be built, and the transportation industry will also be rapidly developed, achieving automobile access to every commune, horse-drawn carriage access to every district, and motorization of short-distance transportation. In addition, the Zhang River, which flows through the county, will be comprehensively managed this year, and five large reservoirs and power stations will be built successively.
    Now, the people of the county are carrying out a large-scale technical skills competition campaign on the industrial front with a bold and daring communist style; on the agricultural front, they are continuing to carry out an in-depth and magnificent red, diligent, and clever competition campaign centered on agricultural technology transformation.

    太行山上的一面红旗——平顺
    英雄人民战胜自然　变“五行俱缺”为五业齐兴
    本报讯　勤劳勇敢的山西平顺人民，1959年在党的领导下，依靠人民公社的力量，对各种自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争，取得了农林牧副渔全面大丰收。
    全县粮田面积二十万亩，平均亩产四百零二点五斤，比1958年提高了26．1％，提前八年实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的指标。过去平顺县每年都需要国家供应四五百万斤左右粮食，1959年除了满足全县所需要的口粮、饲料、种子以外，还卖给国家一千多万斤粮食。多种经济也获得了空前发展。造林面积比1958年扩大27．2％，全县平均每人有林坡七点六亩，各种木材树一千六百多株，水果树二百六十多株。以养猪为主的畜牧事业也飞跃地发展起来。在这个仅有三万户的县里，共有猪四万多口，羊十五万只，大牲口一万六千多头。同1958年相比，猪增长34％，羊增长18％，骡马增长32％。副业生产有很大发展，开办了各种作坊，副业收入比1958年增长了64％。渔业生产，也开始有了发展。
    一年来，按照平顺的特点，因地制宜地办起各种厂矿六十八座。现在每个公社都建立了农具修配、化肥、农副产品加工、建筑材料、制造工厂，并且有十一个公社和管理区建立了发电站。工业年产值达到三百一十六万元，比1958年提高一点一倍。一年来，这些工厂制造和改良各种农具二十五万余件，制造化肥四千五百余吨。交通运输事业也相应发展起来。在这个“不平不顺”交通闭塞的山区，已经修筑了公路二百二十一公里，大车路一百二十五公里，一般车路和驼运路二千八百多公里。胶轮车、平板车、铁轮车整天络绎不绝地将本地的农产品运往城市，把大量的工业日用品运来山区。
    生产全面发展，人民的经济生活也发生了巨大的变化。全县总收入达到一千二百九十七万元，比1958年增长了40．3％。每人平均收入一百零八元，比1958年提高了46％；95％以上的社员增加了收入。
    平顺人民把1959年各个战线上的全面大丰收归功于人民公社。在这一年中，人民公社认真贯彻了农业八字宪法，同自然灾害进行了顽强斗争。去年开春，县委就发动全县人民，组织大兵团作战，开展了深翻土地运动，深翻土地达到总耕地的70％。肥料平均每亩施肥一百六十担。播种量比过去提高20％到30％，作到合理密植，保证了苗全苗旺。夏季正当各种作物孕穗的时候，遭到了七十二天“卡脖子”大旱灾，以后又遭到了三次大风灾、七次雹灾、八次虫灾。但是这些灾害吓不住英雄的人民，他们在县委的领导下，组织五六万大军进行抗旱斗争，充分利用了现有的水利建设，提水浇苗，引水浇地，战胜了旱灾，保证了丰收。
    县级机关干部，经常有30％到50％的人在农村、厂矿工作，做到了行行有帅，路路有兵，百业齐兴，全面跃进。在全县开展了群众性的“学天柱，赶江考，人人红勤巧，处处赶超高”的劳动竞赛运动，涌现出了成批的个人与集体标兵，红勤巧积极分子有三万多人。1959年，全县人民共作劳动日一千二百七十九万个，比大跃进的1958年增加了47％。每个劳动日平均生产价值一点二二元，比1958年提高27％。
    1960年的奋斗目标是：粮食单位面积产量提高到五百斤，全县总产一亿斤；造林十五万亩，植树一亿株，培育果园三万亩，达到每人十亩林、三千株树，每户一亩果园；全面发展畜牧业，养猪二十六万口，实现一亩地一口猪，大牲畜达到九千头，羊达二十五万只；副业生产收入达到五百万元。
    1960年将新建和扩建各种厂矿七十三座，交通运输业也将得到迅速发展，实现社社通汽车、区区通马车、短途运输车子化。此外，流过境内的漳河今年将得到综合治理，五座大水库和发电站将陆续建成。
    现全县人民正以敢想敢干的共产主义风格，在工业战线上开展了声势浩大的技术比武竞赛运动；在农业战线上，继续深入开展了气势磅礴的以农业技术改造为中心的红勤巧竞赛运动。（方中谷、卫廷瑾）
