Party Newspapers Should Plant More Red Flags
Zhang Pinghua, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee of the CPC

Recently, our province's newspapers and periodicals have prominently reflected the new situation, new atmosphere, new red flags, and new pacesetters that have emerged in the anti-rightist and morale-boosting campaigns, which is very good. Now, we must further strengthen the propaganda work of newspapers and periodicals on this basis, and I hope everyone will pay attention to studying this issue. I would like to talk about three points below:

I.

Grasp typical examples. To better grasp the advanced units, advanced figures, and advanced experiences that have emerged on various fronts, and to report them more prominently, and to more forcefully promote the current movement, this should always be the policy of our newspapers and periodicals, and also the basic method of our reporting work.

Newspapers and periodicals should adopt an enthusiastic attitude towards good things, advanced things, and new things, and disseminate and promote them in a timely manner. This is a great help to leading organs. Why do I say this? Because the primary issue for leading organs in doing any work is to implement the Party's mass line policy well. Combining general appeals with specific guidance is an important principle for following the mass line; and grasping typical examples, relying on advanced units, advanced figures, advanced thinking, and advanced experience to guide work, is precisely a method of combining general appeals with specific guidance. Newspapers and periodicals summarize typical experiences and publicize them to the masses, which is the application of this method. Typical examples come from the masses. The masses have a lot of creativity, and these creations are much better than what we think of sitting in the office. Without these things, we can simply say that we are "at a loss." It can be seen how important it is for newspapers and periodicals to grasp typical examples in propaganda and reporting work.

There are many typical materials. For example, after a conference of advanced producers is held, many advanced units and advanced figures will emerge, whether on the industrial front, the agricultural front, or the financial and trade front. We can select the outstanding ones from these advanced units, carefully summarize their experiences, and focus on publicizing them, so that everyone not only knows that they are advanced, but also knows how they are advanced and why they are advanced, and draws many useful things from it. The New Hunan Daily should report several bright red flags within a month, prominently placing them on the front page in the headlines, and all other reports should give way to it. Throw a stone and it will create waves; the newspaper should throw two big stones every week to create big waves. Each advanced unit should be published in the newspaper for one day, or continuously reported for several days, with communications, news, special features, and commentaries, with large headlines, and even printed in red when necessary, to make it eye-catching, so that people can't help but read it when they get the newspaper. These materials should not be wasted. If they are not published prominently or are scattered, readers will not see the face of the typical example, or they will not be able to think deeply and attract attention after reading it, which is a waste of material. Our reports must make a very deep impression on people after reading them, and they should not be easily forgotten. This requires us to select materials very well. Therefore, we advocate that everyone should have an enthusiastic attitude towards red flags and advanced experiences, and always pay attention to finding these things. As long as you smell a bit of fragrance, go and find the fragrant grass; if you hear a good news there, follow up and investigate it carefully, and make it deep and thorough. When the editor-in-chief, deputy editor-in-chief, and other responsible comrades go to the countryside and factories, if they seize a typical example, they should come up with something.

In terms of working methods, I suggest that the editor-in-chief or the comrades in charge of newspapers and periodicals reduce some of the daily routine work, and the deputy editor-in-chief or secretary-general and other comrades should grasp more of the daily routine work, so that the editor-in-chief has more time to go down, read books, write things, study the resolutions and documents of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, and grasp the ideological dynamics. If the editor-in-chief's daily routine work is piled up too much, he will not have time to consider these things. The editor-in-chief of the newspaper should not only follow the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee in his work, but also follow the Provincial Party Committee in person. He should often go down with the comrades of the Provincial Party Committee to conduct investigations and research, listen to the opinions put forward by comrades from all sides, and seize good things when he finds them, organize people to write manuscripts, or send reporters to collect and write. When assigning tasks to reporters or correspondents, it should be specific, with specific units, specific objects, and specific content and specific requirements, so that the things produced will be more lively. In addition, it is very necessary to hold a symposium of newspaper and periodical负责人 in a certain period of time to discuss reporting issues and exchange experiences with each other.

II.

Resolutely fight against bourgeois ideology. Grasping typical examples and grasping the advanced, as mentioned earlier, is also an aspect of the struggle against bourgeois ideology. Take these positive things to fight against those negative things, and use positive things to prove the errors of bourgeois ideology, which is also a kind of struggle. In addition to this kind of struggle, our newspapers and periodicals must also conduct systematic and thematic criticisms against bourgeois ideology and publish some theoretical articles. The theoretical articles we are talking about are fundamentally different from those so-called "fundamental theories" that are spoken by people who stand on the bourgeois position and are not related to the current work. Our theoretical articles are targeted and combined with the current work, with a high degree of ideological and combat effectiveness, and also with realistic guidance; both theoretical and practical.

In criticizing bourgeois ideology, we should also criticize things that we have not discovered or grasped in the past. For example, "middle-of-the-road thinking." At present, there are still people who express their "determination to settle down in the middle reaches." I am afraid that quite a few people are still affected by this kind of thinking. If our newspapers and periodicals do a good job in this area, the educational significance will be great. Middle-of-the-road thinking has its social and class roots. It is a reflection of petty-bourgeois, small-producer, and small-peasant economy thinking, not the proletariat's. We say that being satisfied with the middle reaches is actually being content with the lower reaches. Being satisfied with the middle reaches and being content with the lower reaches are two different forms of ideological expression, but they are essentially the same. Because in reality, the productive forces of society are developing rapidly, and our entire socialist construction is developing rapidly and by leaps and bounds. If we are satisfied with the middle reaches and do not strive to be in the upper reaches, we will inevitably fall behind in this rapidly developing situation. Therefore, we say that "middle reaches" have no way to "settle down," if you don't advance, you will retreat! People who are content with the middle reaches will inevitably fall behind and retreat. It is worthwhile to write well about such an idea.

In addition, there is another type of article, called sketches or essays, which can be very effective if written well. The "Debate on the True and False Hai Rui" recently published in newspapers and periodicals seems to be very beneficial. We must make everyone realize that the real Hai Rui, the leftist Hai Rui, is what the Party advocates. There is also the problem of "fear of ghosts." In our historical legends, there are many good stories of not being afraid of ghosts. From these stories, we can see that the tradition of our nation has always been to promote justice over evil. These stories all run through such a spirit, that is, righteousness can overcome evil. As long as you are not afraid of ghosts, ghosts cannot harm you. It is not people who are afraid of ghosts, but ghosts who are afraid of people. There is a saying in Hunan: "If there is no ghost in your heart, evil will not enter." There is such a story: A person lived in a ghost den. A group of ghosts smelled the smell of living people and came in to search, groping around but could not find them. They wondered, "In the past, we found people as soon as we looked for them. Why can't we find them today?" After hearing this, the person stretched out a hand and said, "I'm here!" When the group of ghosts heard this, they all knelt down to him tremblingly. The person interrogated these ghosts one by one, "What kind of ghost are you?" Some said they were hanged ghosts, some said they were burned ghosts, drowned ghosts, and so on. After the interrogation, the person said, "Don't make trouble here anymore, quickly escape for your lives!" As a result, all the ghosts ran away and never came back again. This shows that righteousness can overcome evil, and that people who are afraid of ghosts are because they have no soul. From the ghosts' discussion, it can be seen that people who are afraid of ghosts lose their souls as soon as they see ghosts, so they are easily discovered by ghosts, and ghosts can easily catch them; but this person is not afraid of ghosts, and his soul does not leave his body when he sees ghosts, so the ghosts are afraid of him, so he must have a soul. The reason why we communists are not afraid of ghosts is because we have a soul - Marxism-Leninism. Some comrades have a firm stand and are not influenced by bourgeois ideology. What do they rely on? It is relying on Marxism-Leninism as this soul, that is, relying on politics in command. Some people are easily influenced by bourgeois ideology because their souls are not strong, not a completely Marxist-Leninist soul, or because they have completely lost their souls. Marxism-Leninism is our most important magic weapon. In the play "Lotus Lantern," holding this lamp can win the battle, but losing this lamp to others will lead to defeat. This shows that fighting requires a "magic weapon." We can win all our battles by relying on Marxism-Leninism as this magic weapon. We cannot disarm at any time. Writing this kind of article can also be in the form of essays. The "July 1st" magazine once published two articles on not being afraid of ghosts, which were very well written. Our newspapers and periodicals should write more of this kind of article, which is very helpful for educating people to liberate their minds.

III.

The current situation in Hunan Province, like other parts of the country, is very good. The political situation is that righteousness is rising and evil is declining, and the Party's unity has been unprecedentedly strengthened; the economic situation is that production is booming, the economy is prosperous, and trade is thriving. In agriculture, with water conservancy construction as the center, we will further improve the various tasks of cultivating winter crops, accumulating fertilizer, deep plowing, afforestation, etc., vigorously grasp sideline production (including short-distance transportation), increase cash income, and at the same time carry out animal husbandry production centered on pig raising. In industry, the 1959 plan has been completed ahead of schedule. On the financial and trade front, the procurement task has been overfulfilled, and the supply of means of production and means of livelihood in urban and rural areas is also being actively carried out. Cultural and educational work has also developed greatly accordingly. In order to continue the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1960, the province is carrying out a production increase and economy practice campaign centered on technological innovation and technological revolution. All cadres and the broad masses are full of confidence and are welcoming future tasks with the spirit of hard work, practical work, and clever work.

Our newspapers and periodicals must grasp this excellent situation, and around these tasks, under the principle of highlighting the center while taking into account the general, comprehensively and correctly publicize the Party's various policies and guidelines, actively and enthusiastically grasp typical examples and plant more red flags, so that our newspapers and periodicals become an ocean of red flags and a sharp weapon for promoting the cause of socialist construction.

    党的报刊要大插红旗
    中共湖南省委第一书记　张平化
    近一时期来，我们全省的报刊，突出地反映了在反右倾、鼓干劲中所出现的新的形势、新的气象、新的红旗、新的标兵，这是很好的。现在，我们就要在这样一个基础上，进一步加强报刊的宣传工作，希望大家都来注意研究这个问题。下面我想谈三点：
    一
    抓典型。更好地抓住各个战线上出现的先进单位、先进人物、先进经验，更加突出地报道出来，更有力地推动当前的运动，这应当永远是我们报纸、刊物的方针，也是我们进行报道工作的基本方法。
    报刊对于好的东西、先进的东西、新生的事物要抱热情的态度，及时传播、推广。这对领导机关来说，是一个很大的帮助。为什么这样说呢？因为领导机关不论作任何一件工作，首要的问题都在于贯彻执行好党的群众路线的方针。一般号召和具体指导相结合，是走好群众路线的一条重要原则；而抓典型，依靠先进单位、先进人物、先进思想、先进经验来指导工作，正是一般号召和具体指导相结合的方法。报纸、刊物总结典型经验，向人民群众进行宣传，就是这种方法的运用。典型是从群众中来的，群众当中有很多的创造，这些创造，比我们坐在机关里面想出来的东西要好得多，没有这些东西；我们简直可以说是“一筹莫展”。可见，报刊在宣传报道工作中抓典型是多么的重要。
    典型材料是很多的。比如先进生产者会议一开，就会出现许多先进单位和先进人物，不论是工业战线、农业战线还是财贸战线，都是如此。我们可以在这些先进单位当中，挑选突出的，认真地总结一下他们的经验，集中地加以宣传，不仅使大家知道他们先进，而且使大家知道他们怎么样先进，为什么先进，从这里面吸收到许多有益的东西。新湖南报应当在一个月之内，报道几面鲜艳的大红旗，突出地把它排在头版头条的地位上，其他报道都要给它让路。丢石头，就要起波浪；报纸每一个礼拜之内要丢两个大石头，让它引起大波浪。每一个先进单位让它在报纸上刊登一天，或者是连续报道它几天，既有通讯，又有消息，又有特写，又有评论，大字标题，必要的时候还要套红，使它醒目，使人拿到报纸不能不看。这些材料，不要把它浪费了，要是登得不突出、零散了，读者看不到典型的面貌，或者是看了以后不能发人深思，引人注意，那就是浪费了材料。我们的报道，一定要使人看了以后，印象非常深刻，不容易忘掉。这样，就要求我们很好地选择材料。因此，我们提倡大家对红旗、先进经验有一种热爱的情绪，经常注意寻找这些东西，只要闻到一点香味，就去找香草；听到那里有个好消息，就跟踪追寻，认真调查研究，把它搞深、搞透。总编辑、副总编辑以及其他负责同志下乡下厂的时候，抓住一个典型，就应该搞出一个东西来。
    在工作方法上，我提倡总编辑或者主持报纸、刊物的同志，把日常的事务工作减少一些，副总编辑或者秘书长等等同志多抓一些日常事务工作，要让总编辑有更多的时间下去，看书、写东西、研究中央和省委的决议和文件，掌握思想动态。总编辑的日常事务工作堆多了，就没有工夫去考虑这些东西了。报刊的总编辑不仅在工作上要跟着省委的精神跑，人也要跟着省委跑。经常同省委的同志一起下去搞调查研究，多听各方面同志提出的意见，发现好的东西就抓住不放，组织人们写稿子，或者派记者去采写。给记者或通讯员布置任务的时候要具体，既要有具体单位，具体对象，又要有具体内容和具体要求，这样搞出来的东西就容易生动活泼些。另外，在一定时间内，召开一次报刊负责人座谈会，座谈报道问题，相互交流经验，很有必要。
    二
    坚决同资产阶级思想作斗争。前面所讲的抓典型、抓先进，也是同资产阶级思想作斗争的一个方面，拿这些正面的东西，去和那些反面的东西作斗争，用正面的东西来证明资产阶级思想的错误，这也是一种斗争。除了这样一种斗争之外，我们的报刊还要针对资产阶级思想，进行系统的、专题性的批判，发表一些理论文章。我们所说的理论性的文章，和那些站在资产阶级立场的人所讲的和当前工作不相关的那种所谓“根本性的理论”是根本不同的。我们这些理论文章，是有的放矢，和当前工作相结合，既有高度思想性、战斗性，又有现实的指导性；既有理论，又有实际。
    在批判资产阶级思想当中，也还应该对我们过去没有发现或者没有抓紧的东西进行批判。譬如“中游思想”，当前就还有人表示“决心在中游安居乐业”。恐怕受这种思想影响的人还相当多。我们的报刊如果好好在这方面作一作文章，教育意义就很大。中游思想是有它的社会和阶级根源的，它是小资产阶级、小生产者、小农经济思想的反映，不是无产阶级的。我们说，满足于中游，实际上就是甘居下游。满足于中游和甘居下游这两种思想表现形式不同，本质上则是一样的。因为实际上社会的生产力是迅速向前发展的，我们的整个的社会主义建设是迅速地、突飞猛进地向前发展的，如果满足于中游，没有力争上游的劲头，在这种突飞猛进的发展形势下，他必然要掉队。所以，我们说“中游”没有办法“安居”，不进则退！甘居中游的人，必然掉队，必然后退。对这样一种思想，很值得好好作一作文章。
    另外，还有一类文章，叫作小品，或者叫作杂文，写得好，很起作用。最近期间报纸、刊物上刊登的“真假海瑞辩”，看来就很有益处。要使大家认识到，真正的海瑞、左派的海瑞才是党所提倡的。还有“怕鬼”的问题，在我国的历史传说里面，有很多好的不怕鬼的故事，从这里面可以看到我国民族的传统，一直就是提倡正气压倒邪气。这些故事都贯穿着这么一个精神，就是正气能够压倒邪气，只要你不怕鬼，鬼是伤害不了你的，不是人怕鬼，而是鬼怕人。湖南有句俗话说：“心中无鬼邪难入”。有这么一个故事：有一个人住进了鬼窝里，一群鬼闻到有生人气味就进来搜索，摸来摸去也摸不着，就奇怪地说：“过去找人，一找就找到了，今天为什么找不到？”这个人听了以后，就伸出一只手来说：“我在这里！”这群鬼一听，就都战战兢兢地给他跪下了，这个人就一个个地审问这些鬼：“你是什么鬼？”有的说是吊死鬼，有的说是烧死鬼、淹死鬼，等等。审完之后，这个人就说：“你们再不要在这里闹了，赶快各自逃生！”结果这些鬼都逃跑了，再也不来了。这说明正气能压倒邪气，说明怕鬼的人是因为他没有灵魂。从那些鬼的议论里面，可以看出怕鬼的人一看到鬼，灵魂就离开了，因此容易被鬼发现，鬼就容易抓住他；而这个人不怕鬼，见了鬼灵魂不出窍，鬼就怕起他来了，所以说要有灵魂。我们共产主义者所以不怕鬼，就是因为有一个灵魂——马克思列宁主义。有些同志立场很坚定，不受资产阶级思想影响，他依靠什么呢？就是依靠马克思列宁主义这个灵魂，也就是依靠政治挂帅。有些人容易受资产阶级的思想影响，就是因为他的灵魂不强，不是完全的马克思列宁主义的灵魂，或者是因为他完全失掉了灵魂。马克思列宁主义是我们最主要的法宝。在“宝莲灯”这出戏里面，拿着这个灯就能打胜仗，这个灯被人家偷走了就打败仗，这说明战斗要有“法宝”。我们的一切战斗，靠马克思列宁主义这个法宝就能取得胜利，我们在任何时候都不能解除武装。写这类的文章，也可以用杂文的形式，“七一”杂志曾经发表了两篇不怕鬼的文章，写得很好，我们的报刊就要多写这样的文章，对教育人们解放思想很有作用。
    三
    当前湖南省的情况同全国各地一样，形势好得很，政治形势是正气上升，邪气下降，党的团结空前加强；经济形势是生产上出现高潮，经济繁荣，贸易兴旺。在农业方面，正以兴修水利为中心，进一步做好培育冬季作物、积肥、深耕、造林等等各项工作，大抓副业生产（包括短途运输），增加现金收入，同时开展以养猪为中心的畜牧生产。工业方面已经提前完成了1959年计划。在财贸战线上，收购任务已经超额完成，城乡生产资料、生活资料的供应也在积极进行。文化教育工作也相应地有了很大的发展。为了1960年工农业生产的继续跃进，全省正在开展一个以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。全体干部和广大群众都信心百倍地以苦干、实干和巧干的精神，迎接今后的任务。
    我们的报刊必须把握这个大好形势，围绕这些工作，在突出中心兼顾一般的原则下，全面地、正确地宣传党的各项方针政策，积极热情地大抓典型，大插红旗，使我们的报刊成为红旗的海洋，成为促进社会主义建设事业的利器。
