    Mongolian Shepherd Girl Xu Xiuying
    By Our Correspondent Liao Youbin
    In November 1959, the climate on the Horqin Grassland in Inner Mongolia suddenly turned cold, and heavy snow began to fall. During this time of thousands of miles of frozen ground and ten thousand miles of snow, Xu Xiuying, a Mongolian shepherd girl who had been named a national and Inner Mongolian labor model and advanced worker eighteen times in a row, led the shepherd girls of her Zhong'aobentai Production Team in grazing the strong livestock herds on the snowy winter pastures. Sometimes they also had to return to the winter camp to care for the old, weak, and young livestock left in the pens. After more than half a month of hard work, they finally overcame three blizzards, ensuring that none of the team's more than 2,100 head (and individuals) of livestock suffered losses, and each one was as plump and fleshy as they were in the autumn.
    Twenty-year-old shepherd girl Xu Xiuying, on the first day after returning home from attending the National Day tenth anniversary celebrations in Beijing, actively participated in livestock production and worked with the commune members to formulate the 1960 livestock production plan. In order to realize the team's leap forward plan to increase the number of large and small livestock from more than 2,100 head in 1959 to more than 3,300 head (and individuals) in 1960, they also built more than fifty new sheds and pens so that different types of large livestock, female livestock, old and weak livestock, young livestock, and pregnant female livestock could live in warm sheds and pens. In particular, the twenty-four nursery rooms (sheds and pens) she built for young livestock looked like a "hospital" from a distance. Outside the nursery room was a long corridor, and inside the nursery room was divided into eight sections, each with fire walls of different temperatures. Although the outdoor temperature was already a severe cold of minus twenty degrees Celsius, the indoor temperature remained warm as spring. She placed each winter lamb in a nursery room with a different temperature depending on its physical strength, and gradually moved them as the lamb's body strengthened, until the lambs were all strong enough to adapt to the outside temperature before leaving the nursery room. Therefore, in the recent three blizzards, not a single lamb was lost, achieving a survival rate for all and plumpness and strength for each.
    In order to achieve a continued leap forward in livestock production, Xu Xiuying also conducted a re-examination of the breeding of large livestock, ensuring that all of the team's more than 950 head of large and small female livestock were fully bred and pregnant. The two-lamb-a-year mountain sheep have already begun to give birth to winter lambs one after another. When all the lambing is completed, the 139 Mongolian and Han commune members of the Zhong'aobentai Production Team will have an average of more than two head of large livestock and three small livestock per person, and the number of pigs raised will have increased from more than 100 in 1958 to more than 600, reaching one pig per person. This has completely changed the past situation of emphasizing agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry here.
    People who see this scene of thriving livestock may not imagine the twists and turns Xu Xiuying encountered in the past in developing animal husbandry. In 1956, the cooperative bought more than twenty pigs, and when it came to assigning a feeder, no one wanted to do it. In less than two months, three feeders in a row had quit. At this time, some commune members suggested selling the pigs. When Xu Xiuying heard that they were going to sell the pigs, she volunteered to be the feeder. After she became the pig feeder, she was ridiculed by many people. First of all, her family did not agree with her raising pigs, thinking that it was enough to stay at home and do farm work instead of going to middle school, why bother to raise pigs. Some commune members even gave her the nickname "Pig Official." However, Xu Xiuying ignored these things, believing that anything that was good for the cooperative should be done. When she first started raising pigs, she encountered many difficulties. Because there was no feed stored, and it was early spring with no green grass or wild vegetables, she went to the threshing ground every day to collect buckwheat flowers and mixed them with dried vegetables to feed the pigs. Soon, the wild vegetables grew out, and she carried a basket to the wild to pick wild vegetables every day, busy from morning to night, sometimes even forgetting to eat. In this way, by the end of the year, she had finally fattened the more than twenty pigs, increasing the cooperative's income by more than 1,000 yuan.
    In 1958, after Xu Xiuying became the deputy captain of the livestock production team, in order to improve the breed of livestock, she volunteered to go to the Jerim League Animal Husbandry Cooperativization School to learn the technology of artificial insemination for sheep improvement. Unexpectedly, this was met with even more ridicule. However, Xu Xiuying did not waver in the slightest. A few months later, the first generation of Xinjiang sheep and Mongolian sheep that she improved gave birth to lambs. More than 100 Mongolian and Han commune members in the village gathered to watch. They saw dozens of newborn lambs that were tall and large, weighing more than twice as much as Mongolian sheep lambs. Even those who had ridiculed her in the past praised her. But Xu Xiuying was not satisfied. In order to solve the difficulty of having few Xinjiang breeding rams, she came up with the idea of using Mongolian sheep and Mongolian goats to crossbreed and improve the breed. Several experiments failed because the sheep did not go into heat when they saw the goats. She couldn't sleep for several nights because of this. Once, when Xu Xiuying was feeding a small lamb that didn't have any milk, she thought that if she isolated the newborn small lamb from the large sheep and then fed it goat's milk, wouldn't it develop a relationship with the goat? So, she found another small lamb to experiment with. After four or five months, the small lamb that grew up eating goat's milk did not flock with the sheep. She used this sheep to breed with a female mountain goat and gave birth to a hybrid first-generation goat lamb with fine hair and heavy body. So she vigorously promoted it. Up to now, there are more than 280 first-generation sheep improved with sheep and goats. Last summer, when catching cashmere and shearing wool, the cashmere production of the first-generation goat lambs was more than two ounces per lamb, while the cashmere production of unimproved goat lambs was one ounce. Then, Xu Xiuying also successfully improved the local large livestock with Sanhe horses and Sanhe cattle, which was praised by the masses. The commune members who had ridiculed her before gave her another nickname this time, no longer ridiculing but praising Xu Xiuying as "our shepherd girl."
    In Xu Xiuying's livestock production team, I also heard two rare things: Xu Xiuying mixed raw buckwheat flour with cold water and fed it to pregnant cows, horses, sheep, and sows, which can prevent miscarriage. Now, none of the more than 900 head (and individuals) of large and small female livestock that have become pregnant in their production team have miscarried. Another thing is that in winter and spring, when ewes lack milk after giving birth, feeding raw buckwheat flour can increase the milk production of each female livestock by three ounces per day. Now, these two methods are being vigorously promoted in various production teams of the Yaolimaodu People's Commune. Why can Xu Xiuying think of things that others haven't thought of? The main reason is that she is good at relying on the masses. It turned out that both of these things happened in their production team this spring. At that time, the female livestock that were about to give birth were about to miscarry, and some female livestock that had twins lacked milk after giving birth. The commune members were so anxious that they stamped their feet, but Xu Xiuying thought that there must be a cure for every disease, and she would definitely be able to think of a way. She visited old herdsmen everywhere to ask for advice, and finally learned this wonderful formula from an old herdsman who had been grazing for forty years, and timely solved the problem of livestock miscarriage and lamb milk deficiency.
    Anything that is good for the cooperative should be done, this is the attitude of the Mongolian shepherd girl Xu Xiuying towards work. It is precisely because Xu Xiuying has such a will that she has no scruples about everything related to herself. If the commune needs a feeder, she steps forward to be a feeder; if she needs to learn the technology of artificial insemination for sheep improvement, she resolutely goes to learn it. She ignores all ridicule and sarcasm. Ridicule and sarcasm not only cannot shake Xu Xiuying, but also prompt her to muster greater efforts, and finally make the ridiculer and satirist lower their heads.
    Xu Xiuying has a strong confidence, is not afraid of any difficulties, and always pursues progress. Therefore, she has not only achieved success in production, but also continuously created miracles in the experiment and research of production technology. Our exploration and struggle with nature is endless, and we will inevitably encounter various difficulties. With Xu Xiuying's determination, in the struggle with nature, we can continuously overcome difficulties and continuously innovate production technology.
    Xu Xiuying is a young Mongolian shepherd girl. She symbolizes that on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, in the vast pastoral areas of the motherland, groups of new types of shepherd girls are growing rapidly.

    蒙古族牧羊姑娘徐秀英

    1959年11月，内蒙古科尔沁草原气候骤然转冷，天空下起了大雪。在这千里冰封、万里雪飘的时候，连续十八次被评为全国、内蒙古的劳动模范和先进工作者的蒙古族牧羊姑娘徐秀英，领着她所在的中敖本台生产队的牧羊姑娘，在白雪皑皑的冬季牧场上牧放着肥壮的畜群，有时还要回到冬营地照看留在圈里的老弱幼畜。她们经过半个多月的艰苦工作，终于战胜了三次暴风雪，使全队二千一百多头（只）大小牲畜没有受到损失，只只都像秋天时那样长得膘满肉肥。
    二十岁的牧羊姑娘徐秀英，在北京参加国庆十周年观礼回家后的第一天，就积极参加牧业生产，和社员们一起制定了1960年牧业生产的计划。为了实现全队大小牲畜由1959年的二千一百多头发展到1960年的三千三百多头（只）的跃进计划，领导社员又新建了五十多座棚圈，使不同种类的大畜、母畜、老弱牲畜、仔畜和怀孕母畜都能住上温暖棚圈。特别是她给幼畜新建的二十四间护理室（棚圈），远远望去活像一座“医院”。在护理室外是一条长长的走廊，在护理室内又分八个段，在每个段的房子里都设有不同温度的火墙。室外虽然已经是零下二十多度的严寒，室内却依然温暖如春。她根据每只冬羊羔的身体强弱程度，分别放在不同温度的护理室，随着羊羔的身体逐步增强而递换，最后直到羊羔都健壮了，可以适应外面的气温才离开护理室。因此，在最近三次的暴风雪中，没有损失一只羊羔，达到了只只成活、个个肥壮。
    为了实现牧业生产的继续跃进，徐秀英又进行了大牲畜配种的复查工作，使全队九百五十多头大小母畜都达到了满配满怀。一年下两次羔的山绵羊已经陆续开始下冬羔。等到接羔全部完毕的时候，中敖本台生产队的一百三十九户蒙汉族社员平均每人就有大牲畜两头多，小牲畜三只，饲养的猪也由1958年的一百多口发展到六百多口，达到了一人一口猪。这就彻底地改变了这里过去重农轻牧的局面。
    人们看了这幅六畜兴旺的景象，一定想不到徐秀英过去为发展畜牧业所遇到的波折。1956年社里买了二十多口猪，在配备饲养员的时候，谁也不愿意干，在不到两个月的时间，一连换了三个饲养员都没有干下去。这时，有些社员主张把猪卖掉。徐秀英一听要卖猪，就自动要求当饲养员。她当了猪的饲养员以后遭到不少人的嘲笑，首先她家里的人就不同意她喂猪，认为不上中学读书在家做农活就够了，干吗还要去喂猪。有些社员还给她取个“猪官”的绰号。但是，徐秀英没有理睬这些，她认为只要对社有好处的事就应该干。一开始喂猪，她就碰到很多困难，因为没有贮备饲料，当时又是初春没有青草和野菜，她就每天到场院收拾荞麦花掺着干菜喂。不久，野菜长出来了，她又每天挑着筐子到野外拾野菜，从早到晚忙个不停，有时连饭也顾不上吃。就这样，到一年终了，她终于把二十多口猪喂肥了，给社里增加了一千多元的收入。
    1958年，徐秀英担任牧业生产队的副队长以后，为了改良牲畜的品种，就自愿到哲里木盟牧业合作化学校学习绵羊改良人工授精的技术，没想到这又遭到更多人的嘲笑。但是，徐秀英丝毫没有动摇。几个月以后，她改良的第一代新疆羊和蒙古绵羊下羔了，村里的一百多户蒙汉族社员都围拢来看，只见初生下的几十只小羊羔，又高又大，体重比蒙古绵羊羔多一倍多，连过去讽刺她的人也都称好。但是徐秀英没有满足，她为了解决新疆种公羊少的困难，又想出用蒙古绵羊和蒙古山羊杂交改良品种。几次试验都失败了，因为绵羊见了山羊不发情。她为这事一连好几夜也睡不着觉。有一次，徐秀英在喂没有奶吃的小羊羔时想到，如果把初生下的小绵羊羔和大羊隔离然后喂山羊的奶，这不就和山羊发生了感情吗？于是，她又找了只小绵羊羔进行试验。过了四、五个月以后，果然吃山羊奶长大的小绵羊不和绵羊合群了。她用这只绵羊和山母羊配种生下杂交第一代的山羊幼羔，毛细体也重。于是她大力推广，到现在用绵羊和山羊改良的第一代羊已达二百八十多只，去年夏天抓绒和剪羊毛时，改良的第一代山羊幼羔产绒量每只二两多，而没有改良的山羊羔产绒量是一两。接着，徐秀英又用三河马和三河牛进行本地大牲畜改良也获得成功，受到了群众的赞扬。原先讽刺她的社员这回又给她取了个绰号，不再是讽刺而赞美徐秀英是“我们的牧羊姑娘”。
    我在徐秀英的牧业生产队，还听到两件稀罕的事：徐秀英用生荞麦面和凉水拌了喂怀孕的牛、马、羊、猪母畜，就能保住不流产。现在她们生产队已经怀孕的九百多头（只）大小母畜，从没有一头流产。另外一件事是，在冬天和春天母羊产后缺奶时，喂生荞麦面就能使每只母畜每天增加三两奶量。现在，这两个办法正在腰力毛都人民公社各生产队大力推广。为什么别人没有想到的事徐秀英能够想到呢？主要是她善于依靠群众。原来，这两件事今年春天在她们生产队都发生过，当时眼看快要下羔的母畜流产了，有些一胎双羔的母畜产后又缺奶，社员们都急得跺脚，而徐秀英心想百病有百药治，这也一定能够想出个办法，她就四处拜访老牧民求教，后来终于在一个放牧四十年的老牧人那里学到了这个妙方，及时地解决了牲畜的流产和羊羔缺奶的问题。
    只要对社有好处的事就应该干，这是蒙古族牧羊姑娘徐秀英对待工作的态度。正因为徐秀英有了这样一个意志，对于有关个人的一切，她才毫无顾虑。公社需要饲养员，她就挺身做饲养员；需要学习绵羊改良人工授精的技术，她就坚决去学习。什么嘲笑、讽刺，一概置之不理。嘲笑和讽刺不仅动摇不了徐秀英，而且促使她鼓起更大的干劲，最后让嘲笑和讽刺者低下头来。
    徐秀英有着坚强的信心，不畏任何困难，永远追求前进，因而她不仅在生产上连连取得了成就，而且在生产技术的试验、研究上，也不断地创造了奇迹。我们对于自然的探索和斗争是永无止境的，而且不免会遇到各种各样的困难。有了徐秀英这样的决心，在同自然斗争中，就能不断克服困难，使生产技术不断革新。
    徐秀英是一个年轻的蒙古族牧羊姑娘。她象征着在内蒙古草原上、在祖国辽阔的牧区，一群群新型的牧羊姑娘正在迅速成长。
