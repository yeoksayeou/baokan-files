    Siyang Creates "Strip Ridge Deep Plowing" Method

    (Our dispatch) Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, has created and widely promoted the "strip ridge deep plowing" method in the winter plowing movement, finding a good way to complete deep plowing tasks quickly, efficiently, and economically. The county began in early December of last year, and in less than twenty days, completed more than 533,000 mu of deep plowing tasks, accounting for 85% of the spring sowing area in 1960.

    The "strip ridge deep plowing" method involves first planning the crop layout, assigning each crop to a specific field, planting according to local conditions, and determining the number of planting rows. Then, using a combination of human and animal power, or animal power double-plowing, deep plow along the rows. For example, in fields intercropping corn and soybeans, the area for soybeans is simply plowed into ridges; no deep plowing is required. In the rows for corn, the land is first plowed six inches deep, and then manually dug with shovels and spades to a depth of six inches or more, reaching a depth of over one foot two inches. After plowing, fertilizer is applied in the deep furrows, which can achieve increased production of both grain and oil. Other crops can also be deep plowed using this method. In this way, strip ridge deep plowing significantly reduces the actual area being deeply plowed. For example, in fields intercropping peanuts and corn, only a little over one fen of land is actually plowed per mu; in cornfields intercropping soybeans, about two fen of land is actually plowed per mu; in cotton fields with varying row spacing, three fen of land is actually plowed per mu, and in fields with equal row spacing, four fen of land is actually plowed. This can greatly save labor.

    Deep plowing is one of the main measures Siyang County has taken to achieve increased agricultural production. In the past, land that has been deeply plowed has increased production by more than 50%. However, in the past deep plowing mainly relied on manual digging, which was inefficient. A strong laborer could only dig two fen of land per day, and animal power double-plowing was also slow. Therefore, some cadres and the masses generally believed that large-scale deep plowing was not easy, and could only be done in small experimental plots. In this situation, the county party committee promptly promoted the experience of Siyang Farm in 1959, which achieved high yields by implementing strip ridge deep plowing in intercropped corn. They organized cadres from various communes to visit advanced areas three times, vigorously publicized the benefits of strip ridge deep plowing and its significance for increasing production, and mobilized cadres and the masses to calculate detailed accounts, criticizing the fear of difficulties. The Shuang'an Brigade of Lai'an Commune originally believed that there was a shortage of manpower and animal power, and that time was short, so in the winter of 1959, they could only deeply plow half of their land. After calculating the detailed accounts, the entire brigade's 1,700 mu of winter plowing land had 70 head of cattle, which could be matched into 39 plows. Each plow could be manned by two people, who could plow more than two mu of land per day. The entire brigade could plow 80 mu of land per day, which could be completed in twenty days. The county's 630,000 mu of winter plowing land could organize 15,000 plows, which could plow 30,000 mu per day, 300,000 mu in ten days, and could be completed in more than twenty days. After calculating the detailed accounts, the problems of manpower, animal power shortages, and short time disappeared. In order to more effectively promote the experience of strip ridge deep plowing, Siyang County finalized the layout of various crops for 1960 and issued them to the communes. The layout was then assigned to brigades and teams, and the teams quickly assigned it to each plot of land, in order to carry out deep plowing according to crop row spacing.

    The county organized a deep plowing force of more than 50,000 people, adopting the method of assigning personnel, land, and remuneration. Communes and brigades also organized manpower cooperation, providing timely support to areas with weak manpower and animal power and large amounts of land. At present, deep plowing in the county is nearing the final stage, and is undergoing inspection and acceptance. Any work that does not meet the required standards is immediately re-plowed.

    翻的快　质量好　省劳力
    泗阳创“条垅深翻”法
    本报讯　江苏泗阳县在冬耕运动中，创造和大面积推广了“条垅深翻”法，为多快好省地完成深翻任务找到了好办法。全县从去年12月初开始，不到二十天内，就完成了五十三万三千多亩的深翻任务，占1960年春播面积的85％。
    “条垅深翻”法是先规划好作物布局，每种作物都落实到田，因地种植，确定种植行数，然后采取人牛力相结合或牛力套耕的方法，按行深翻。如在玉米间作大豆的田里，种大豆的地方用犁条耕成垅即行，不用深翻；种玉米行的土地上，先用犁耕六寸深，再用人力锹锨挖六寸深以上，深度可达一尺二寸以上，翻成后在深翻沟内施上肥，可以达到粮、油齐增产。其他作物也同样可以采取这种方法深翻。这样条垅深翻，实际的深翻面积大大缩小了。如花生间作玉米地，每亩实翻一分多地；玉米地间种大豆，每亩实翻二分地左右；棉花大小行，每亩实翻三分地，等行距实翻四分地。因而可以大大节省劳力。
    深翻是泗阳县取得农业增产的主要措施之一，历年来凡是深翻的土地，都增产五成以上。但由于过去深翻主要靠人力刨挖，工效太低，强劳力每人每天只能挖二分地，牛力套耕速度也慢。因此，部分干部和群众普遍认为大面积深翻不容易，只能在小块试验田里搞深翻。在这种情况下，县委及时推广了泗阳农场1959年间作玉米实行条垅深翻获得高产的经验，三次组织各社干部到先进地区去参观，大力宣传了条垅深翻的好处和对增产的意义，发动干部群众算细账，批判了畏难思想。来安公社双安大队原来认为人、牛力缺乏，时间短，1959年冬季只能深翻一半。经过算细账，全大队一千七百亩冬耕田，有七十头牛，配成三十九张犁，深翻人力三百四十八人，每天每张犁两个人可耕翻二亩多地，全大队每天耕八十亩地，二十天即可耕完。全县六十三万亩冬耕田，可组织一万五千张犁，每天可耕翻三万亩，十天三十万亩，二十多天也可完成。经过算细账，人、牛力缺，时间短的问题就不存在了。为了更有效地推行条垅深翻的经验，泗阳县将1960年的各种作物布局全部定案，下达各公社后，随即将布局定到大队、小队，队又迅速定到每块地，以便按作物行距进行深翻。
    全县组织了五万多人的深翻队伍，采用了定人、定地、定报酬的办法。各公社各大队还组织人力协作，对人、牛力弱、土地多的地方及时支援。目前全县深翻已接近扫尾阶段，正在检查验收，对不合规格要求的立即重翻。
