Arrange Production Well to Ensure a Flying Start After the Holiday

Commentator of this newspaper

The Spring Festival is approaching. After the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, a situation of continuous leap forward with both high speed and proportion in the development of our national economy has been established. The Party's general line for building socialism, the development speed of the Great Leap Forward, and the organizational form of the people's commune, these three magic weapons for building socialism, have become even more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. People have more profoundly recognized the future and the great power of the organized masses, and thus more consciously play an active and creative role in socialist construction. Under this political and economic situation, the national workers have also achieved a great victory in the "flying start" of 1960. "Welcoming the New Year amidst joyful reports," is naturally even more joyful and exhilarating.

The facts of previous years have proved that the period after the start of the year and before the Spring Festival is a preliminary battle for completing the annual industrial production plan. This year's preliminary battle has been fought beautifully. Thousands of modern factories and "small foreign groups" enterprises have realized the oath of "flying start, all-round red," and many suggestions for technical innovation have just been applied to production and have already shown their brilliance, increasing production several times or dozens of times. All this makes us even more confident in achieving a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward in 1960. However, the preliminary battle is only the prelude to the entire campaign after all. To win a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward in the annual industrial production, we still need to follow this good start and continue to work hard without slackening. Therefore, while happily celebrating the Spring Festival, we must not relax production before, during, and after the festival; on the contrary, precisely because the Spring Festival is a holiday and some workers will use this holiday to return to their hometowns to visit relatives, we must arrange production well so that the good situation of pre-holiday production and construction will continue to develop after the holiday, and that enterprises that do not stop production during the Spring Festival will maintain a continuous upward trend.

To do a good job in production before and after the Spring Festival, especially after the festival, the key lies in ensuring attendance. In previous years, production around the Spring Festival, especially after the Spring Festival, often showed some decline. This is not some objective law, but mainly caused by the relatively low attendance rate before and after the Spring Festival, especially after the Spring Festival. The Spring Festival holiday is relatively long, and it is a traditional custom for some workers to use this holiday to return to their hometowns to visit relatives. However, in our lives, the most important thing is still labor production and building socialism at high speed. Therefore, for enterprises where production cannot be stopped, workers should not necessarily arrange all the holidays they enjoy during the Spring Festival during the Spring Festival period, and can adopt a rotation system; several cities across the country have made such arrangements, and the vast number of workers are very satisfied. The behavior of these comrades, who are wholeheartedly devoted to production, demonstrates a high degree of awareness and is worthy of learning and respect from the people of the whole country. Comrades who go home for the festival should learn from the spirit of these comrades and return to their respective posts on time after the festival. The transportation department should also do a good job of sending passengers back. As long as attendance is guaranteed, it is not difficult to do a good job in production after the Spring Festival and make post-holiday production even better than pre-holiday production.

The industrial production in 1960 was able to change the convention of "high at the end of the year and low at the beginning of the year" and achieve a "flying start." An important experience is that sufficient production preparations were made before the year. To do a good job in production after the Spring Festival, we must also learn from this experience and do a good job in production preparations for after the festival before the festival. After more than 20 days of production practice, we should say that we have begun to become familiar with the new production tasks. It is relatively clear what adjustments the equipment still needs to make and what reforms the process still needs to make. When we seize the preparation for post-holiday production, we should combine these new situations to organize production more rationally and obtain higher efficiency. During the Spring Festival, both passenger and freight transportation tasks are heavy, and the transfer of raw materials should be tightened. In particular, the raw materials that are most urgently needed for production must be consigned as early as possible and the transportation department should be requested to transport them as early as possible.

There are only a few days left before the Spring Festival. I wish you all a happy Spring Festival and greater victories in production during and after the Spring Festival!

    安排好生产  保证节后满堂红
    本报评论员
    春节快要到了。经过1958年和1959年的连续大跃进，奠定了我国国民经济发展又有高速度又按比例的连续跃进的局面。党的建设社会主义的总路线、大跃进的发展速度和人民公社的组织形式，这三个建设社会主义的法宝已经更加深入人心了。人们已经更加深刻地认清了前途，认清了组织起来的人民群众的伟大力量，因而更加自觉地在社会主义建设中发挥积极性和创造性。在这种政治经济形势下，全国职工又取得了1960年开门红的伟大胜利。“捷报声中迎新春”，自然是更加欢乐，更加兴高采烈的。
    历年的事实证明，开年之后、春节以前的这段时间，对于完成全年的工业生产计划来说，是一个前哨战。今年的这场前哨战打得很漂亮，千千万万个现代化大工厂和“小洋群”企业都实现了“开门红，全面红”的誓言，许多技术革新的建议刚刚运用到生产中去就已锋芒毕露，使生产得到几倍、几十倍的提高。这一切使我们对实现1960年更好更全面的继续跃进更加充满了信心。但是，前哨战毕竟只是整个战役的序幕。要赢得全年工业生产更好更全面的继续跃进，还需要我们循着这个良好的开端，毫不松懈地继续努力。因此，在欢欢喜喜过春节的同时，我们丝毫也不能放松节前节中和节后的生产；相反地，正因为春节要放假，有些职工要利用这个假期回乡探亲，我们更要把生产安排好，使节前生产建设的良好形势在节后更加持续地发展下去，使春节期间不停止生产的企业保持持续上升的局面。
    要搞好春节前后的生产，特别是节后的生产，关键在于保证出勤。往年春节前后，特别是春节以后的生产，常常发生有些降低的现象。这并不是什么客观规律，主要是春节前后，特别是春节以后出勤率比较低造成的。春节的假期比较长，有些职工利用这个假期回乡探亲，是一个传统的习惯。但是，在我们的生活中，最重要的毕竟还是劳动生产，高速度建设社会主义。因此，凡是生产上不能停顿的企业，职工们应该在春节享受的假日，不一定全部安排在春节期间，可以采取轮休的办法；全国已经有好几个城市作了这样的安排，广大职工非常满意。这些同志一心为生产的行为，表现了高度的觉悟，值得全国人民学习和尊敬。回家过节的同志，应该学习这些同志的精神，在节后准时回到各自的岗位。运输部门也要做好把旅客送回来的工作。只要出勤有了保证，搞好春节以后的生产，使节后生产更比节前红，是不难做到的。
    1960年的工业生产能够一改“年末高，年初低”的常规，实现“开门红”，一条很重要的经验就是年前做了很充分的生产准备工作。要搞好春节后的生产，也必须吸取这个经验，节前做好节后的生产准备工作。经过二十多天的生产实践，我们对于新的生产任务，应该说是已经开始熟悉了。设备还需要进行哪些调整，工艺还需要进行哪些改革，都比较明确了。在我们抓紧节后生产准备工作的时候，应该结合这些新的情况，把生产组织得更合理，能够得到更高的效率。春节期间客货运输任务都很繁重，原材料的调运更应该抓得紧一些。特别是那些生产上最迫切需要的原材料，一定要及早托运，要求运输部门及早运到。
    还有几天就过春节了，祝大家春节快乐，在春节期间和节后的生产中取得更大的胜利！
