    Visiting Relatives in Shahe
    Li Ming
    I walked to Zhao Jiahe Village, ten li away, to visit relatives. It was early autumn, and the summer heat hadn't dissipated. I was soaked in sweat after walking only two li.

    If it weren't for my sixth sister's repeated letters and my mother's constant urging, I really wouldn't have wanted to go to Zhao Jiahe Village. Before coming home, I learned from a letter that my sixth sister had married into Zhao Jiahe Village, and the first thing that came to mind was "asking for trouble"; because I was familiar with the situation in Zhao Jiahe Village. It was located at the head of the Great Sand River, and outside the village, there was nothing but barren sand. Ten years ago, when I was a primary school teacher there, I had suffered enough from the wind and sand. The fierce wind blew sand into every corner of the village houses. Every day, I would shake a handful of dirt off my sheets. Even the flour jar with a lid would be coated with "gold." What's worse, the wind blew sand into the fields, burying the tender, slender seedlings alive, causing crop reductions and failures. In good years, they could only "plant a gourd and harvest two ladles." In bad years, it was truly "a year of hard work without even earning back the seed money!"

    My sixth sister married Zhao Shide's fourth son. I also knew Zhao Shide, a tall, thin man with a sallow complexion and perpetually red and swollen eyelids. He spent his days sitting in the corner of the wall, brooding with a pipe in his mouth, sighing twice for every word he spoke. He had a bunch of children. The fourth one was probably that barefoot, disheveled child with prominent ribs, who should be in his twenties now, right?

    I felt increasingly thirsty as I walked. Looking up at the scorching sun, and thinking about the sandy, bumpy road in the Great Sand River where it was difficult to move, I felt a little timid.... Fortunately, a large cart came from behind, driven by an old man.

    "Uncle, where are you going?"

    "Zhao Jiahe!"

    "I'm also going to Zhao Jiahe," I said, stepping forward with a smile on my face, "Could you give me a ride?"

    The old man sat on the cart without even lifting his eyelids and replied bluntly, "No!" Seeing that I was still following closely, he said, "Well, you comrade are too delicate. Are you afraid of wearing out your feet on these few li?"

    "It's hot, and I'm very thirsty!"

    "Thirsty? This cart doesn't have a teahouse!" He tightened the reins, slowed down the cart, and reached into a pocket to pull out two rosy red apples. He leaned over and handed them to me, "Bite into the apple and walk slowly!"

    "This is truly a stingy yet generous strange old man," I thought. But in the blink of an eye, he had already driven away, not giving me a chance to thank him.

    After passing the dike, it should have been the yellow, sandy river滩, but it wasn't. Instead, I was greeted by a green ocean – trees everywhere, near and far, high and low, with a road shining in the middle. The road was lined with grapes, with vines extending from both sides, forming a green corridor. Stepping inside, I immediately felt a sense of coolness.

    On the left side of the road was a belt of mulberry trees, with uniform white ashes among the large rows. Under the white ashes, there were also endless daylilies. It was the flowering season, and the flowers in the sunlight looked like a golden dragon.... The right side of the road was even more impressive. Not to mention the rows of pagoda trees and tamarisk that could produce a lot of firewood and charcoal, within its protective circle, large apples, hawthorns, peaches, and yellow pears were all laden with fruit. These fruits gleamed, brighter than the stars in the sky. How big of a yield would that be?

    A group of girls were busy picking the ripe apples in the forest. They were singing together, and their singing was so melodious and moving. They must have been intoxicated with the harvest.

    I followed the clear tire tracks and walked straight into Zhao Jiahe Village.

    When my sixth sister saw me, she smilingly led me to the main room. Her face was radiant, and she was clearly fatter than a few years ago. She was wearing a white blouse with blue flowers made of silk material and a bright green short skirt around her waist, dressed like a college student in the city.

    "Life here has become better!" I said.

    "Is it? It was always good!" My sixth sister replied casually. Then, she complained, "As soon as I heard that you were home for summer vacation, I sent a letter to ask you to come. At that time, he was at home and could have spent two days playing with you..."

    I understood that "he" referred to my brother-in-law, so I asked, "Where did he go now?"

    "He went to the county for a meeting, a meeting for socialist construction activists. He might be back today!" Saying that, she went out to get me water to wash my face.

    With a creak, the outer door opened. Could it be that he was back? I quickly leaned forward to look. No, it was an old man who came in.

    When we first met, we were both stunned.

    He was the old man who drove the cart, also known as Zhao Shide from ten years ago who sighed constantly, and is now the father-in-law of my sixth sister. I didn't recognize him in a hurry on the road. Now I've taken a good look.

    He also remembered me: "Ha, Teacher Li...nephew, I didn't recognize you on the road! Currently, our commune's transportation tasks are too urgent. There are mountains and piles of fruits that need to be transported out day and night. Our date-red horse is pulling too hard and cannot carry a load on the way back, so you didn't get a ride...don't mind it, haha!"

    "Don't mention it!" I felt embarrassed when he said that.

    "It will be better in two years!" My sixth sister put down the thermos and interjected, "The Party Secretary said that we are going to build a small railway here!"

    "How can it be done without building a railway?" Zhao Shide sat down, smoking his pipe and squinting his eyes. "In two years, we will be able to harvest tens of millions of catties of fresh fruit in a single season, as well as countless strip goods and wood.... At that time, relying on dozens of single-horse carts is like a mouse gnawing on a flagpole—you can't handle it! Ha...."

    He laughed loudly and crisply. He was no longer the Zhao Shide from ten years ago. I couldn't help but blurt out, "Uncle, you're in good spirits!"

    "Old!" He stroked his beard. "My hair is white, my wrinkles are deeper, and my teeth are loose!"

    I laughed.

    "But my heart, nephew, is young." He gesticulated with his pipe, saying, "At first, the Party led us to establish mutual aid teams. We started to seal the sand and plant trees. Then we had elementary cooperatives, advanced cooperatives, and communes. The organization expanded year by year, and the trees took root and grew more lush year by year." He took a deep puff of smoke and said, "Our forest belts and networks strangled the sand, immobilizing it like a 'freezing spell.' Even if the wind blows again, it won't raise sand. Our land has become better. This year, wheat production has doubled. The sweet potatoes and peanuts are growing very vigorously. Don't think that we planted so many trees, we are still a surplus grain production brigade! The people's commune has made a major plan for the land, planting trees where trees should be planted, planting fields where fields should be planted, and planting vegetables where vegetables should be planted, so that agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery all thrive together..."

    As I listened to him talk, I looked out the door at the lush forests and green fields. I kept repeating in my mind: The place has changed, and the people have changed too!

    沙河探亲
    黎明
    我徒步到十华里外的赵家河村去探亲。时处新秋，暑气未消，走不上二里路，浑身便被汗水浸透了。
    要不是六妹一次连一次地捎信来，要不是母亲再三催促，我真不愿到赵家河村去。来家之前，我在信上得悉六妹嫁到赵家河村的消息后，当时涌上心头的就是“自找罪受”四个字；因为我对赵家河村的情况是熟悉的。那里地处大沙河头，村外除了一片荒沙之外，还是一片荒沙。十年前的一个春季，我在那里当小学教员时，就受够了风沙的气。那狂烈的风把沙土刮进村舍的角角落落。我天天会从被单上抖下一捧土来，即是那盖着盖子的面缸，也会镀上一层“金”；更糟的是，风把沙土卷进农田，把嫩黄纤细的禾苗活活埋葬，造成庄稼的减产和失收。那里好年头儿也不过“种一葫芦收两瓢”，要再逢上孬年头呀，就真是“辛苦一年，捞不上种籽钱”了！
    六妹嫁的是赵十德的四儿子。赵十德我也知道，是个瘦长个儿，蜡黄脸膛，眼皮经常红肿着的半老头子，成年价含着烟袋坐在墙角里纳闷，说一句话叹两口气。他有一群孩子，老四大概就是那个赤脚蓬头，肋巴骨一根一根凸露的孩子，眼前也该有二十几岁了吧？
    我越走越感到有点口渴。抬头望望那火热的太阳，想想那大沙河里拔不动脚的沙疙疸路，心里畏缩起来……。幸好，有一辆大车从背后驶来了，赶车的是个老汉。
    “大伯，你往哪去？”
    “赵家河！”
    “我也到赵家河，”我走上一步，满脸陪笑地说：“让我凑个方便，搭搭车吧！”
    老汉坐在车上眼皮没翻，直接了当地回答道：“不行！”他见我还紧跟着，说道：“唔，你这位同志太娇气了，这几里路还怕跑大了脚？”
    “天气热，我口渴得很！”
    “渴？车上没有开茶馆呀！”他勒勒缰绳，把车子的速度放慢，腾出一只手向一条口袋里摸索出两只红扑扑的大苹果来，探探身递给我：“你咬着苹果慢慢走吧！”
    “这真是一个小气而又大方的怪老汉，”我想。但一转眼，他已赶车走开了，没容人道谢。
    过去大堤，应当是黄沙腾腾的河滩了，可是不然，迎面却是一片绿色的海洋——那远远近近，高高低低全是树，正中闪出一条马路。马路两旁满栽葡萄，枝蔓从两旁腾空延伸过来，搭成了一条绿色的长廊，一脚踏进去，立刻给人一阵清凉的感觉。
    路左面是一带桑林，大行之间是清一色的白腊，白腊脚下，还有一眼望不到头的黄花菜，这时正是开花时节，花朵在太阳光下，好似一条金色的龙……。马路的右边就更有出息了。且不说那一行一行的杨槐、柽柳能产多少木柴和炭薪，在它的保护圈内，那大块的苹果，山楂、蜜桃、黄梨，都满挂着累累的果实，这些果实闪着光亮，赛过满天星斗，它又有多大的一笔出产呢？
    林里有一群姑娘正忙着采摘那熟透的苹果，她们一起在唱歌，歌声是那么悦耳动听，她们一定陶醉在丰收里了。
    我循着清晰的胶轮车印，一直走进赵家河村。
    六妹见我来了，笑盈盈地领我到正房里去。她满面红光，比前几年显然发胖了。她上身穿着白底蓝花的绸料褂子，腰里系一件葱绿短裙，打扮的活像城市的一位大学生。
    “你们这儿生活变的好过了！”我说。
    “是嘛？本来就不错呀！”六妹漫不经心地回答，接着，她却埋怨开了：“一听说你回家来过暑假，我便捎信叫你来，那时他在家里，可以陪你玩两天，……。”
    我明白，这个他，是指我妹夫，便问道：“他现在上哪去啦？”
    “上县开会去了，社会主义建设积极分子会议，说不定今天回来！”说着，她就走出去给我打洗脸水去了。
    吱地一声，外门开了，可巧是他回来了吧？我连忙探身张望。不是的，是一个老头进来了。
    当我俩打第一个照面时，竟互相楞住了。
    他就是赶车的那个老人，也就是十年前那个唉声叹气的赵十德，现在我六妹的公公。路上仓促间我没有认出他来，现在算是看准了。
    他也记起来了：“哈，黎先……生，大侄子，路上我没认出是你呀！当前我们公社的运输任务太急了，有成山成垛的果子要连日连夜运出去，咱的枣骝马架辕子太累了，不能在回头路上加载，所以，你没有坐上车……别见怪呀，哈哈哈！”
    “哪儿话呀！”他一说，我倒不好意思了。
    “再过两年就好了！”六妹放下热水瓶，插嘴说：“党委书记说，咱这里要修一条小铁路哩！”
    “不修铁路怎能成？”赵十德坐下来，吸着烟，眯?着眼说：“再过二年，一宗鲜果就能收摘几千万斤，还有那数不清的条货、木料……，那时间，靠几十辆单头马车，真是老鼠啃旗杆，吃不消啦！哈……。”
    他笑的很响，很脆。他已经不是十年前的赵十德了。我情不自禁地脱口而出说：“大叔，你精神倒好！”
    “老了！”他捋捋胡子，“头发白了，皱纹多了，牙根也活动了！”
    我笑了。
    “但是，我的心，侄子，却年轻了。”他捏着烟袋比手划脚地说：“起先，党领导咱们成立了互助组，我们动手封沙造林，到初级社、高级社、公社，组织一年比一年扩大，树木也一年比一年根深叶茂了。”他猛抽了一口烟，说：“咱们的林带林网把沙土掐死，像‘定身法’似地定住它，再刮风也不扬沙了。咱们的土地变好了，今年麦子产量翻了一番，眼前山芋、花生长的很旺，别看咱种下这样多的树，还是余粮社呢！人民公社对土地进行了大规划，该种树的地方种树，该种田的地方种田，该种菜的地方种菜，农林牧副渔五子登科……”。
    我一面听着他谈话，一面望着门外那葱茏的树林和碧绿的田野。心里直念叨：地方变了，人也变了！
