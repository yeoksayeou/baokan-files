The brilliance of the General Line shines everywhere
The Great Leap Forward's red flowers bloom in competition to celebrate the New Year

Establish lofty aspirations to continue the Great Leap Forward
Encourage hard work to climb peaks, bravely advance, and triumphantly bid farewell to the old year

Establish grand ambitions to greet the New Year
Celebrate last year's complete victory and wish for success in everything this year

People's communes thrive with flowers and spring forever
Socialism's roots are deep and its foliage luxuriant for ten thousand years

Dig wells and repair canals to conquer drought
Open mountains and split rocks to transform nature

Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side occupations, and fisheries develop in all aspects
Workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers each display their abilities

Bid farewell to the old year with a Great Leap Forward in all aspects of work
Greet the New Year with everyone's mind full of joy

The masses are of one mind to make a Great Leap Forward in all fields
The ambition to increase production promotes a high tide of great construction
