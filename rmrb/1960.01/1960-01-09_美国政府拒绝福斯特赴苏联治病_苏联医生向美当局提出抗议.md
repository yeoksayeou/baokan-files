    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 5th: Soviet doctors are protesting the persecution of the ailing, prominent American social and political activist, and honorary chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, William Z. Foster, by U.S. authorities.
    "Medical Workers' Gazette" published on the 5th a letter from a group of prominent Soviet doctors, stating that they are indignant at the U.S. authorities' rude and inhumane refusal to allow Foster to seek medical treatment in the Soviet Union.
    Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences academicians Vinogradov, Vasilenko, Vovsi, and Taleyev wrote, "We know that Foster, as a great social activist, has dedicated his life to the struggle for the vital interests of the American people and for peace. We express our surprise at the fact that in a country that talks so much about the rule of law and democracy, such inhumane behavior has occurred. We protest the inhumane treatment of Foster. We believe that Foster will have the opportunity to have Soviet doctors treat him."

    美国政府拒绝福斯特赴苏联治病
    苏联医生向美当局提出抗议
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联医生抗议美国当局迫害患病的美国著名的社会和政治活动家、美国共产党名誉主席福斯特。
    “医务工作者报”在5日发表了一批苏联著名的医生的一封信，信中说，他们对美国当局拒绝让福斯特到苏联医病的这种粗暴和非人道行为，感到愤慨。
    苏联医学科学院院士维诺格拉多夫、瓦西连科、沃符希和塔列耶夫写道，我们知道，福斯特作为一个伟大的社会活动家，他把自己的一生都贡献给争取美国人民切身利益和争取和平的斗争。我们对这样一个事实表示惊奇，即在一个大讲法制和民主的国家里，竟出现了如此不人道的行为。我们抗议非人道地对待福斯特。我们相信，福斯特将有机会让苏联医生为他治病。
