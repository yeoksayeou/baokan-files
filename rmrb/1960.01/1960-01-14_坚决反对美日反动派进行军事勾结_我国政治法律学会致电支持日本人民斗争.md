    Xinhua News Agency, January 13th—The China Political Science and Law Society today sent a telegram to the Japanese "Conference of Jurists to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" and the Japanese National Conference to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," representing all Chinese legal workers in expressing firm support for the nationwide unified action launched by the Japanese people and Japanese legal professionals in opposing the revision and striving for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" on the eve of Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States to sign the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
    The telegram pointed out that "The U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' not only violates the will and interests of the Japanese people, but also rudely violates all international agreements concluded among the Allied countries during World War II regarding Japan's post-war path of peace and democracy, and goes against the universally recognized peaceful aims of international law. A treaty like this, which violates both international obligations and the will of the Japanese people, is of course completely illegal."
    The telegram said, "The purpose of U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government in stepping up the revision of the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' is to form a military alliance with the people of China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries as enemies, making Japan a military base and accomplice for U.S. imperialism to conduct nuclear war in Asia, in order to further carry out aggression and expansion in Southeast Asia. This not only drags the Japanese nation back onto the road of war, but also seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, the struggle waged by the Japanese people, who have tasted the bitterness of war, to expose and crush this conspiracy is completely just, and it will surely receive the warm support of peace-loving people in Asia and the world and all upright legal workers."
    The telegram said, "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people. Opposing the conclusion of a military alliance treaty between U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government, and opposing the revival of Japanese militarism, are the common tasks of the Chinese and Japanese people. Chinese legal workers are deeply concerned about the just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and believe that this struggle not only conforms to the national interests of Japan, but is also an important contribution to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world."
    The telegram concluded, "Chinese legal workers firmly believe that Japanese legal friends, under the banner of law serving peace and justice, will continue to strengthen unity, work with people from all walks of life in Japan, resolutely carry out the struggle against the military collusion between the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to the end, and that final victory will surely belong to the heroic Japanese people."

    坚决反对美日反动派进行军事勾结
    我国政治法律学会致电支持日本人民斗争
    新华社13日讯　中国政治法律学会今天打电报给日本“法学家阻止修改安全条约”会议和日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，代表全体中国法律工作者表示坚决支持日本人民和日本法律界人士在岸信介去美国签订日美军事同盟条约前夕所发动的反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”全国统一行动。
    电报指出，“日美‘安全条约’不仅违反了日本人民的意志和利益，同时还粗暴地破坏了第二次世界大战中同盟国之间缔结的一切关于战后日本应走和平民主道路的国际协定，违背了世界公认的国际法的和平宗旨。像这样一个既违反国际义务又不符合日本人民意志的条约，当然是完全非法的。”
    电报说，“美帝国主义和岸信介政府加紧修改日美‘安全条约’的目的是要结成以中国、苏联和亚洲各国人民为敌的军事同盟，使日本成为美帝国主义在亚洲进行核战争的军事基地和帮凶，以便进一步向东南亚进行侵略扩张。这不仅把日本民族重新拖上了战争的道路，而且也严重地威胁了亚洲和世界的和平。因此，尝尽战争苦难的日本人民为揭露和粉碎这一阴谋活动所进行的斗争，完全是正义的，它必将得到亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民和所有正直的法律工作者的热烈支持。”
    电报说，“美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人，反对美帝国主义和岸信介政府缔结军事同盟条约，反对日本军国主义的复活，是中日两国人民的共同斗争任务。中国法律工作者对日本人民反对日美军事同盟和争取独立、民主、和平中立的正义斗争深为关怀，认为这一斗争不仅符合日本的民族利益，而且也是对保卫亚洲和世界和平的重要贡献。”
    电报最后说，“中国法律工作者深信，日本法律界的朋友们在法律为和平与正义服务的旗帜下，将继续加强团结，同日本各界人民一道，把反对美日反动派进行军事勾结的斗争坚决进行到底，最后的胜利一定属于英勇的日本人民。”
