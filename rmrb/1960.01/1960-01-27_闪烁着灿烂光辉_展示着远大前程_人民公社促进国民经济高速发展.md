Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: China's people's commune industry has already demonstrated strong vitality and infinitely broad development prospects. According to preliminary statistics as of the end of 1959, the number of commune-run industrial units nationwide (excluding industrial units run by production teams and below under the commune), after rectification and improvement, has reached more than 200,000, with more than five million employees; the total output value of commune-run industry for the year increased by 70% compared to 1958.

Among commune-run industries, there are industries such as agricultural tool manufacturing and repair, chemicals, and building materials, as well as industries such as food, sewing, and shoemaking; there are mineral mining industries serving large-scale industry, as well as preliminary processing of agricultural products. After a year of rectification and improvement, commune-run factories have established relatively sound management systems, labor productivity has continuously improved, costs have gradually decreased, and accumulation has rapidly increased.

People's commune industry was born and grew strong in the great people's commune movement in China in 1958. In the past year or so, industries serving agricultural production have developed the most rapidly and played the most significant role. According to statistics, in 1959, industries directly or indirectly serving agricultural production accounted for about 55% of the total output value of commune-run industries nationwide. Many communes have formed industrial networks for agricultural tool repair and small agricultural tool manufacturing. Generally, iron and wood agricultural tools can be supplied locally, and simple machinery can be repaired nearby, eliminating the need for external support. Many commune industries have trial-produced or manufactured power machinery and a large number of new-style agricultural tools, equipping various departments of agricultural production. For example, the agricultural tool factory of the Xuguang People's Commune in Echeng County, Hubei Province, has successfully trial-produced more than 30 new-style agricultural tools in the past year, such as rice transplanters, seedling pot-making machines, field threshers, deep plows, and ox-drawn waterwheels, effectively improving agricultural labor efficiency. The 122 ox-drawn waterwheels manufactured by the commune factory alone, when put into production, relieved 3,166 mu of dry land from the severe threat of drought, increased irrigation efficiency by more than tenfold, and saved more than 1,400 man-days.

In terms of serving the lives of commune members and developing collective welfare undertakings, many communes have established their own clothing factories, shoe factories, paper mills, wineries, as well as flour mills and sugar mills, producing a large number of products to directly meet the needs of the masses. For example, a brigade of the Shuangmiazi People's Commune in Changtu County, Liaoning Province, in order to solve the grain needs of 12,000 people in the entire brigade, used 140 clumsy stone mills in the past, plus the labor of dozens of women, and still could not supply enough. Now, with the installation of four rice milling machines and two vertical mills, only three people are needed to meet all the needs. A total of more than 131,000 man-days and more than 170,000 animal-days were saved throughout the year and投入 into agricultural production.

Commune-run industries have also played a good role in supporting national large-scale industrial production and serving the socialist market. Making full use of local resources and adhering to the principle of not competing with large-scale industries for raw materials, they have built a number of preliminary processing factories for agricultural and sideline products and building materials factories, producing a large number of light industrial raw materials, building materials, and mineral raw materials to support large-scale industrial production. Some factories directly produce a portion of the commodities to supply market needs. From October 1958 to October 1959, the production capacity of small paper mills built by people's communes nationwide was equivalent to the average annual newly built large paper mill during the First Five-Year Plan period. These small paper mills have become powerful assistants to large paper mills, producing a large number of paper to supply the needs of the domestic market in the past year.

The great development of commune industry has increased the public accumulation of communes, expanded the economic strength of the commune level, and increased the proportion of industry in rural areas, demonstrating the brilliant prospects of industrialization in China's rural areas. According to a survey conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics on the industry of 78 communes nationwide, these commune industries earned a total net profit of more than 12 million yuan last year, an increase of 2.6 times compared to 1958, accounting for about 40% of the total accumulation of the communes. After the accumulation increased in many communes, they have used more funds to equip agriculture and develop rural collective welfare undertakings.

Running industry in rural areas is the long-term aspiration of the broad masses of Chinese peasants. Only after communization has this ideal become a reality. People's communes have a large organizational scale and a wide range of activities, and can provide the necessary labor force for commune industry when making overall arrangements for rural labor. In addition to transferring a portion of commune members as fixed workers in factories, people's communes in various regions also adopt the method of "small-scale engagement during busy farming seasons and large-scale engagement during slack farming seasons" for some commune-run industries with strong seasonality, and temporarily transfer peasants into industrial production. In this way, there are millions of fixed workers in China's rural areas, and there are also tens of millions of talented people who are both workers and farmers, and versatile. These two teams combine with each other and cooperate closely to become the backbone force for developing rural industry. At the same time, the people's commune has relatively strong economic strength and can make full use of various material resources to run some larger-scale industries. It is precisely because the people's commune has brought its great superiority into play that commune-run industry has developed at an unstoppable speed.

Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: In 1959, while actively developing agricultural production and commune-run industries, people's communes in rural areas nationwide also paid great attention to the development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. The people's communes engaged in all five industries, which not only enabled agricultural production to continue to leap forward last year, but also presented a thriving scene in the production of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In 1959, grain and cotton exceeded the targets set for 1962 in the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule; a total of 280 million mu of afforestation was carried out nationwide, an increase of 7% compared to 1958; the number of pigs raised nationwide reached 180 million, an increase of 13%, and the number of large livestock, sheep, poultry, etc. has increased; aquaculture and sideline occupations have also developed greatly, and the total output value of sideline occupations has increased by more than double. The proportion of the output value of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in the entire agricultural output value has increased significantly.

People's communes have opened up broad avenues for diversified operations. Under the guidance of the Party's policy of "taking grain as the key link, making overall arrangements, and diversifying operations," people's communes nationwide implemented five industries on the agricultural front in 1959, and established specialized teams to expand the operation of other industries according to local conditions. Mountainous communes generally have forestry professional teams. In addition to communes with fisheries as the main focus in fishing areas, some communes also have fishery professional teams. All communes have professional organizations for developing animal husbandry production. Regardless of communes and production teams, they all actively developed sideline occupations last year according to the principle of "small-scale engagement during busy farming seasons and large-scale engagement during slack farming seasons" by transferring a certain amount of labor. After the autumn harvest last year, every commune nationwide established a temporary professional short-distance transportation team to carry out active transportation business; and organized commune members to carry out a large-scale "small autumn harvest" of collecting wild plants. According to preliminary statistics, last year the people's communes nationwide used 12% to 13% of the total labor force of the communes to operate forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. At present, there are more than 16,000 forest farms run by communes and production teams at the two levels in mountainous areas across the country. The most prominent aspect of animal husbandry production is the development of collective pig raising by people's communes in various places last year. At present, there are more than 2 million livestock farms and pig farms run by people's communes nationwide; other breeding of poultry, rabbits, bees, etc. has also developed. Last year, the Fengjia Commune in Zhangwu County, Liaoning Province, established 193 pig farms, 26 dairy farms, 9 poultry hatcheries, 45 rabbit farms, and 15 bee farms; coupled with other income, the income of commune members increased by more than 50% compared to 1958. In terms of aquaculture, in addition to the communes jointly built by the original fishing societies and agricultural societies, people's communes in various places have generally developed fish farming with the development of water conservancy construction.

As a result of the five industries in the people's communes, the economy of both the commune and the team has developed rapidly. In addition to commune-run industries, the commune level also owns larger-scale and better-equipped commune-run forest farms, livestock farms, and ten-thousand-pig farms. Under the overall arrangement of the commune, the combination of the five industries promotes each other, enabling the economy at the basic accounting unit level to develop faster. The Wanzihu Commune in Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, was formed by merging the original five fishing societies and two agricultural societies on the edge of Dongting Lake. After the establishment of the commune, fisheries, agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations have all developed. When agriculture was busy last year, the fishery teams and animal husbandry teams of this commune supported the agricultural teams with a total of more than 40,000 workdays. Fisheries and animal husbandry also provided agriculture with a large amount of fertilizer, and the rations and feed for the fishery teams and animal husbandry teams were also guaranteed. The commune added wind-powered boats and frame nets to the fishery team, and the fish yield increased by about double compared to 1958. Before the establishment of the Chikan Commune in Huaxian County, Guangdong Province, the original Bajiang Agricultural Society had mineral resources such as magnetic soil and refractory materials but was unable to exploit them. After the establishment of the commune, these resources were developed and utilized. Due to the development of diversified operations, the production level of a considerable part of the poor teams across the country quickly caught up with that of the rich teams last year.

Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: The people's commune system is playing an increasingly significant role in ensuring the completion of agricultural product procurement and supply. In 1959, the nation's procurement of various agricultural and sideline products was high in quantity, rapid in speed, and good in quality, showing an excellent situation that had never occurred before communization.

In 1959, on the basis of the continued great leap forward in agricultural production, the total procurement of agricultural and sideline products by commercial departments nationwide increased by 28.2% compared to 1958. Among them, the amount of grain procured increased by 19.4% compared to 1958, the amount of other agricultural products procured increased significantly, and the total amount of sideline products and local specialties procured increased by 62.7% compared to 1958.

The quality of various agricultural and sideline products has improved compared to previous years. The quality of grain stored in warehouses generally meets the standards stipulated by the state. The cotton purchased nationwide has also generally improved by one grade. A large amount of second and third-grade cotton with good quality has emerged, and cotton below the sixth grade has been greatly reduced.

The speed of procurement work last year was also unprecedented before communization. Calculated by production year, the time for completing the grain procurement tasks in various parts of the country was one or two months earlier than in previous years. The time for completing the flue-cured tobacco procurement tasks in various places was also one month earlier than in previous years.

While doing a good job in procurement, various places have also launched mass movements for agricultural product processing and short-distance transportation to ensure that the procured agricultural products can be processed and transported out in a timely manner to supply the needs of light industrial production and the market. By the end of December last year, 62% of the seed cotton purchased nationwide had been processed into ginned cotton and continuously transported to cotton textile factories across the country. Most provinces and regions have concentrated the purchased grain to transportation routes and are ready for national allocation at any time.

The excellent situation that emerged in the procurement of agricultural products in 1959 is a great victory for China's people's commune system. Over the past year, people's communes in various places have correctly implemented the policy of giving equal importance to self-sufficient production and commodity production, and have overcome various serious natural disasters, achieving an all-round great leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and have carefully and meticulously done a good job in harvesting. This has provided a solid material foundation for doing a good job in the procurement of agricultural products. At the same time, the strong and unified leadership of the people's communes enables various tasks in rural areas to be taken into account overall and arranged comprehensively, achieving full utilization and rational allocation of labor, thus ensuring organizationally that the procurement work is done quickly and well.

The tremendous power of the people's communes in procurement work is inseparable from the strengthening of leadership by Party committees at all levels and the correct implementation of the state's procurement policies. For example, in terms of grain procurement, various places generally closely combine procurement and distribution. On the one hand, in accordance with regulations, they leave enough rations, seeds, and feed for the commune, and at the same time lead the masses to vigorously carry out planned grain consumption and grain saving movements to ensure that commune members eat their fill and have reserves. On the other hand, for some grain-deficient areas and disaster areas, unified sales work has been arranged in a timely manner to ensure the grain supply in these areas.

    闪烁着灿烂光辉　展示着远大前程
    人民公社促进国民经济高速发展
    公社使农村工业的发展一日千里，社办工业单位二十多万个总产值增长70％
    公社为多种经营开辟了广阔道路，林牧副渔在农业总产值中的比重显著上升
    公社制度保证农副产品收购得又多又快又好，收购总额比1958年增加28．2％
    据新华社26日讯　我国人民公社工业已经显示出强大的生命力和无限广阔的发展前途。据截至1959年底的初步统计，经过整顿和提高之后的全国社办工业单位（不包括公社生产队以下举办的工业单位），已经达到二十多万个，从业人员五百多万人；全年社办工业总产值比1958年增长70％。
    社办工业中，有农具制造和修理、化学、建筑材料等行业，也有食品、缝纫、制鞋等行业；有为大工业服务的矿产采掘行业，也有农产品初步加工等行业。经过一年的整顿与提高，社办工厂建立了比较健全的管理制度，劳动生产率不断提高，成本逐渐降低，积累迅速增加。
    人民公社工业，是在1958年我国伟大的人民公社化运动中诞生和成长壮大起来的。在过去一年多的时间，社办工业为农业生产服务的行业发展最为迅速，作用最为显著。据统计，1959年全国社办工业总产值中，直接或间接为农业生产服务的工业约占55％左右。很多公社都形成了农具修配和小农具制造工业网，一般铁木农具都能就地供应，简易机械都能就近修理，不再需要依靠外地支援。不少公社工业试制或制造了动力机械和大批新式农具，装备了农业生产各部门。例如，湖北省鄂城县旭光人民公社农具厂，一年来试制成功了下秧机、制钵机、田间脱粒机、深耕犁、牛拉水车等三十多种新式农具，有效地提高了农业劳动效率，单是公社工厂制造的一百二十二部牛拉水车投入生产后，就使三千一百六十六亩旱田解除了严重的旱灾威胁，灌溉效率提高了十多倍，还节省了一千四百多个人力。
    在为社员生活服务和发展集体福利事业方面，许多公社自己办起了服装厂、制鞋厂、造纸厂、造酒厂以及磨面、制糖等工厂，生产大批产品，直接满足了群众生活需要。如辽宁省昌图县双庙子人民公社的一个大队，为解决全队一万二千人用粮的需要，过去用一百四十台笨碾，加上几十个妇女劳力，还供应不上，现在安装了四台碾米机和两台立磨，只用三个人就全部满足了需要，全年共节省十三万一千多个人工和十七万多个畜工，投入了农业生产。
    社办工业对于支援国家大工业生产和为社会主义市场服务也起了良好的作用。它们在充分利用当地资源并且在不同大工业争原料的原则下，兴建了一批农副产品初步加工工厂和建筑材料工厂，生产了大批轻工业原料、建筑材料和矿产原料支援大工业生产。有些工厂直接生产了一部分商品供应市场的需要。从1958年10月到1959年10月，全国人民公社建成的小型纸厂的生产能力，相当于第一个五年计划期间平均每年新建的大型纸厂的生产能力。这些小型纸厂已成为大型纸厂的有力助手，一年来生产了大批纸张供应了国内市场的需要。
    公社工业的大发展，增加了公社的公共积累，扩大了公社一级的经济力量，同时提高了农村中工业的比重，展示了我国农村工业化的光辉前景。据国家统计局对全国七十八个公社工业的调查，去年这些公社工业共获得纯利润一千二百多万元，比1958年增长二点六倍，占公社全部积累的40％左右。不少公社积累增加后，已经用更多的资金来装备农业，发展农村集体福利事业。
    农村办工业是我国广大农民的长期愿望，只有在公社化以后，这一理想才变为现实。人民公社组织规模大，活动范围广，能够在统筹安排农村劳动力时为公社工业提供必要的劳动力。各地人民公社除抽调一部分社员作工厂的固定职工外，对于一些季节性较强的社办工业，还采取“农忙小搞，农闲大搞”的办法，临时抽调农民投入工业生产，这样，在我国农村中就有了数百万固定职工，又有了数以千万计的亦工亦农、多才多艺的人才。这两支队伍相互结合，密切协作，成为发展农村工业的骨干力量。同时，人民公社经济力量比较强大，能够充分地利用各种物质资源，兴办一些规模较大的工业。正是由于人民公社发挥了它的巨大优越性，社办工业就以不可阻挡之势一日千里地向前发展。
    据新华社26日讯　1959年全国农村人民公社，在积极发展农业生产和社办工业的同时，还以极大的注意发展了林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业。人民公社五业并举，不仅使去年农业生产继续跃进，林、牧、副、渔各业生产也都呈现出一片兴旺的景象。1959年，粮棉提前超额完成了第二个五年计划规定的1962年的指标；全国共造林二点八亿亩，比1958年增长7％；全国养猪达一点八亿头，增长13％，大家畜、羊、家禽等都有增加；水产和副业也都有较大发展，副业的总产值增长了一倍多。林、牧、副、渔的产值在整个农业总产值中所占的比重显著上升。
    人民公社为多种经营开辟了广阔的道路。在党的“以粮为纲，全面安排，多种经营”的方针指导下，1959年全国人民公社在农业战线上都实行了五业并举，因地制宜地为扩大经营其他各业建立了专业队伍。山区公社一般都有林业专业队。除渔区以渔业为主的公社外，还有些公社有渔业专业队。所有的公社都有了发展畜牧生产的专业组织。无论公社和生产队去年都根据“农忙小搞、农闲大搞”的原则，抽调了一定的劳动力积极地发展了副业。去年秋收以后，全国每一个公社都建立了临时性的专业的短途运输队伍，开展了活跃的运输业务；又组织社员进行了一次大规模的采集野生植物的“小秋收”。据初步统计：去年全国人民公社用于经营林、牧、副、渔的劳动力占公社全部劳动力的12％至13％。现在，全国山区的人民公社，社队两级所办的林场共达一万六千多处。畜牧生产中最突出的是去年各地人民公社集体养猪业的发展，现在全国人民公社办的畜牧场和养猪场共达两百多万处；其他饲养家禽、养兔、养蜂等也有发展。辽宁彰武县冯家公社去年就办了养猪场一百九十三处、奶牛场二十六处、家禽孵化场九处、养兔场四十五处、养蜂场十五处；加上其他收入，公社的社员收入比1958年增长了50％以上。水产方面，除由原来的渔业社和农业社联合建成的公社外，各地人民公社随着水利建设的发展，普遍发展了养鱼的事业。
    人民公社五业并举的结果，社和队的经济都有很快的发展。公社一级除有社办工业外，还拥有规模较大、设备较好的社办林场、畜牧场、万猪场等。在公社的统筹安排下面，五业结合，互相促进，使基本核算单位一级的经济也有了更快的发展。湖南沅江县万子湖公社，是由洞庭湖边原来的五个渔业社和两个农业社合并建成的。公社成立后，渔、农、牧、副都发展了。去年农忙的时候，这个公社的渔业队和牧业队共支援农业队四万多个劳动日，渔业和牧业还给农业提供了大量的肥料，渔业队和牧业队的口粮和饲料也有了保证。公社为渔业队添置了风网船和架子网，渔产量比1958年提高了一倍左右。广东花县赤坑公社成立前，原巴江农业社有磁土、耐火材料等矿产资源无力开采，公社成立后，这些资源才获得了开发利用。由于多种经营发展，去年全国有相当大一部分穷队的生产水平迅速地跟上了富队。
    据新华社26日讯　人民公社制度在保证完成农产品收购和供应方面，作用愈来愈加显著，1959年全国各项农副产品收得又多、又快、又好，出现了公社化以前从来没有过的大好形势。
    1959年全国商业部门在农业生产继续大跃进的基础上，农副产品收购总额比1958年增加了28．2％。其中，粮食收购量比1958年增长19．4％，其他农产品的收购量都增加很多，副产品和土特产品的收购总额比1958年增长了62．7％。
    各种农副产品的质量都比往年提高。入库粮食质量一般都符合国家规定的标准。全国收购的棉花也普遍提高了一个等级，质量良好的二、三级棉大量出现，六级以下的棉花大大减少。
    去年收购工作进度之快也是公社化以前从来没有过的。按生产年度计算，全国各地完成粮食收购任务的时间，比往年提前了一、两个月。各地完成烤烟收购任务的时间，也比往年提前了一个月。
    在做好收购工作的同时，各地还展开了群众性的农产品加工和短途运输运动，保证收购到的农产品能及时加工、调运出来，供应轻工业生产和市场需要。到去年12月底，全国收购的籽棉已有62％加工成皮棉，源源运往全国棉纺织厂。大部分省区已经把收购的粮食集运到交通沿线，随时准备国家调用。
    1959年农产品收购工作中出现的这种大好形势，是我国人民公社制度的伟大胜利。各地人民公社一年来正确执行了自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，又战胜了各种严重的自然灾害，获得了农、林、牧、副、渔全面大跃进，并且认真细致地做好了收获工作。这就为做好农产品收购工作提供了雄厚的物质基础。同时，由于人民公社强有力的统一领导，使农村各项工作能够统筹兼顾，全面安排，做到了充分利用和合理调配劳动力，因而从组织上保证了收购工作做得又快又好。
    人民公社在收购工作中发挥的巨大威力，是和各级党委的加强领导、正确贯彻了国家的收购政策分不开的。例如在粮食收购方面，各地一般都把收购和分配密切结合起来，一方面按照规定，给公社留足口粮、种子和饲料，同时又领导群众大力开展计划用粮、节约用粮运动，保证社员吃饱吃好，并留有储备。另一方面，对于一些缺粮地区和灾区，都及时安排了统销工作，保证了这些地区的粮食供应。（附图片）（左图作者：顾　朴）
