    Transforming the Pathological into the Normal
    In 1959, the situation on the industrial front in Anhui Province continued to be excellent due to the Great Leap Forward. From the beginning to the end of the year, many major industrial products, such as steel, iron, and coal, achieved high yields month by month, rising steadily. Calculating the average for the twelve months of the year, steel increased by 28.1% month-on-month, iron increased by 10.6%, and coal increased by 5.4%. Like a surging river, the later waves surpass the previous ones, each higher than the last. The vivid practice of industrial leaps and bounds over the past year has further opened people's eyes, powerfully pointing out that maintaining high-speed development and steady rise in industrial production is entirely possible.
    In the past, a phenomenon existed in many industrial units: slack at the beginning of the month, tight at the end of the month; slack at the beginning of the year, tight at the end of the year; rushing the end instead of the beginning; grasping the tail instead of the head; and feeling more and more passive as the days went on. Some people even called this "slack early, tight later" situation a "routine," believing it to be an "objective law" that cannot be changed by human will. However, last year's industrial production in Anhui Province reversed this "routine." Throughout the four seasons and twelve months, there were no sudden ups and downs or drastic rises and falls. Instead, each month surpassed the previous month, and each quarter exceeded the previous quarter, continuously rising higher and higher. Thus, it seems that the "slack early, tight later" phenomenon is not destined to be unchangeable. The appearance of this pathological "slack early, tight later" situation is due, firstly, to improper planning and arrangements in advance, and insufficient production preparation; and secondly, to the mischief of right-leaning thought and insufficient drive and enthusiasm. Obviously, these are all human factors. Some people only see the phenomenon and not the essence, regarding the alternating slack and tight as an "objective law." In reality, this is to cover up their right-leaning thoughts and find excuses for their shortcomings in work. Vivid practice has long refuted this erroneous view. We can no longer allow our thinking to lag behind reality, stubbornly adhere to old habits, and stagnate. The situation is often like this: machines, equipment, raw materials, and so on are no different, but the output decreases when enthusiasm is low and rises sharply when enthusiasm is high. This shows that people's subjective efforts play a leading role in the fluctuations of output. As long as people fully utilize their subjective initiative, situations such as inadequate planning, improper measures, and insufficient preparation can be completely changed. The abnormal phenomenon of alternating low and high can definitely be reversed, and the normal production state of high-speed development and steady rise can definitely be maintained and consolidated.
    As the old saying goes, "The planning of the year lies in spring." This means urging people to seize the early moments, grasp them tightly, cherish the good times, seize the initial opportunity, and diligently implement plans from beginning to end. Seizing the early moments, seizing the beginning, and seizing the lead are essential keys to doing a good job in production. Taking the lead step by step means being proactive step by step; falling behind in one move means being passive in every move. The tremendous leaps forward of the past two years have made us deeply appreciate the significance of winning time. Taking Anhui Province's industrial production tasks this year as an example, every minute of progress means an increase of more than 700 kilograms of steel, more than 5 tons of iron, and 40 tons of coal. Time and output are so integrated that it is truly necessary to "seize every minute and second." Missed time will not come again.
    Looking further ahead, we must also focus on the overall situation. Industry is an organic whole. The production of each part is linked to the next, with each ring connected and interconnected. If you slack off, and output does not increase, you will hold everyone back, affecting the overall high-speed development. Conversely, if you tighten up, and output increases rapidly, it will create a "forcing situation," prompting others to quickly catch up. Chain reactions like this can continuously create a dynamic and lively new situation of catching up with and surpassing each other on the production front. In the thriving socialist production, this is how it is filled with living dialectics. Using tightness to lead slackness, using advanced to lead backwardness, and constantly creating a good situation in production—this is the true color of promoters and the style of revolutionaries.
    Organizing balanced and high production, the important issues lie in regularity, persistence, and creativity. We must embrace great ambitions, rouse our spirits, achieve a good start, a red month every month, and a full house of red, and continuously implement this throughout the year. In this way, the industrial front in 1960 will surely bloom even more beautiful flowers and bear even more abundant fruits.

      Rushing the Beginning, Not the End
    A good start is no longer just red for one day, but red every day, and the redder it gets, the more vibrant it becomes. It shows that the economic construction situation this year is very good, that people's revolutionary enthusiasm is very high, and that the red flag of the general line is being held even higher.
    In the past, people always thought that the decline in production at the beginning of the year and the beginning of the month was a "routine," and some even regarded it as an "objective law." Now, a good start has broken this "routine," and the "objective law" has also been changed. Originally, this "routine" was just an old habit, such as thinking that since we have been busy for a year, we should relax a bit, and there are still long days in the new year, so it's okay to slack off at the beginning and catch up later. It was this kind of thinking that produced that kind of "routine," and it also created the so-called "objective law" of slack early and tight later. Rather than calling this an "objective law," it is better to call it a subjective "law." Objective laws cannot be created or changed, old habits can be changed, and this subjective "law" can also be changed. A good start not only broke this "routine" but also changed this subjective "law," and also found a truly objective law of stable and continuous rise. Developing according to this objective law, we can not only have a good start, but also have a red month every month, a red quarter every quarter, and be red to the end!
    You must know that with the initial victory of a good start, the objective law of stable and continuous rise has been mastered, and the initiative is in our hands. A good start has given us time, and this time can be used to increase production and prepare for the next stage of production. High speed is about winning time, and winning time is victory. The problem now is that as long as we continue to muster revolutionary enthusiasm, fully utilize this initiative, and constantly win time, then we can advance triumphantly and further seize the comprehensive victory of a full house of red and being red to the end.

### 打破旧习惯　建立新常规

    打破旧习惯　建立新常规
    变病态为常态
    1959年，安徽省工业战线上继续大跃进的形势，真是好得很。从年初到年尾，钢、铁、煤等许多主要工业产品，月月高产，步步上升，以全年十二个月平均计算，钢按月递增28．1％，铁递增10．6％，煤递增5．4％。好比滔滔江水，后浪超前浪，一浪高一浪。一年来工业飞跃发展的生动实践，进一步打开了人们的眼界，它有力地指明了，在工业生产中保持高速度发展，稳步上升，是完全可以做到的。
    以往，在不少工业单位中存在这样一种现象：月初松、月终紧，年初松、年终紧，赶后不赶前，抓尾不抓头，日子越朝后，越是感到被动。有的人还把这种“前松后紧”情况，称之为“常规”，认为这是不以人们意志为转移的“客观规律”。然而，安徽省去年的工业生产却一反这个“常规”，一年四季十二个月，并没有出现什么忽上忽下，骤升骤降，而是一月高过一月，下季超过上季，持续不断地往上高升。如此看来，那种“前松后紧”现象，并非是注定不可改变的。“前松后紧”这种病态的出现，一是由于事先计划安排不当，生产准备不周，一是由于右倾思想作怪，干劲钻劲不足。显而易见，这些全是人为的因素。有的人只看现象，不看本质，把一松一紧认作是“客观规律”，实际上这是为他们的右倾思想打掩护，为他们的工作缺点找借口。生动的实践早已否定了这种错误看法，我们再不能使自己的思想落后于实际，固执旧习，停滞不前。情况常常是这样：机器、设备、原料等等并无不同，劲一松产量就往下降，劲一鼓产量就直线往上升，足见产量的起伏波动，是人的主观努力如何在起着主导作用。只要人们充分发挥了主观能动性，计划不周、措施不当、准备不足等情况完全可以改变，低一阵高一阵的反常现象肯定可以扭转，而高速度发展、稳步上升的正常生产状态也肯定可以保持和巩固。
    古话说得好：“一年之计在于春”。意思是督促人们抓早、抓紧，要珍重大好时光，抓住开初时机，兢兢业业，贯彻始终。抓早、抓头、抓先，是搞好生产的一项要诀。步步走先，步步主动；一着落后，着着被动。连续两年的巨大跃进，更使我们深刻体会到赢得时间的意义。以安徽省今年工业生产任务来说，每前进一分钟，就意味着增长了七百多公斤钢，五吨多铁，四十吨煤。时间与产量是如此融成一体，真是需要“分秒必争”，错过了时光，是不再重来的。
    把目光放远点，还要从全局着眼。工业就是一个有机的整体，各个部分的生产，一环扣一环，环环衔接，环环相联。你松了一步，产量上不去，就要扯大家的后腿，影响全盘的高速度发展。反之，你紧了一步，产量上得快，就会造成“逼人形势”，推动别人也迅速上去，一个个连锁反应，就可以使生产战线上不断出现你追我赶、生动活跃的新局面。在蓬蓬勃勃的社会主义生产中，就是这样地充满着活生生的辩证法。以紧带松，以先进带后进，不断创造生产中的大好形势，这就是促进派的本色，革命者的风格。
    组织均衡高产，重要问题在于具有经常性，坚持性，创造性。我们一定要抱雄心壮志，抖擞精神，实现开门红，月月红，满堂红，并常年不断地贯彻下去。这样，1960年的工业战线，必将开放更鲜美的花朵，结出更丰盛的果子。

      赶前不赶后
    开门红已经不是红一天，而是天天红，越红越鲜艳了。它表现出今年的经济建设形势非常之好，表现出人们的革命干劲非常之大，表现出总路线的红旗举得更高了。
    过去，人们总认为年初、月初生产下降是“常规”，甚至有人还奉之为“客观规律”。现在，开门红把这种“常规”打破了，“客观规律”也改变了。原来，这种“常规”只不过是一种旧的习惯势力，如认为忙了一年啦，该松松劲了，新的一年日子还长着哩，开头拉一点，后边再赶也不迟。就是这么一种思想，产生了那么一种“常规”，也是它创造出前松后紧的所谓“客观规律”。与其说这是“客观规律”，不如说它是主观“规律”，客观规律是不能创造和改变的，旧的习惯势力是可以改变的，这种主观“规律”也能改变。开门红不只是打破了这种“常规”，也改变了这种主观“规律”，而且找到了一条稳定地持续地上升的真正客观规律。按照这条客观规律发展，我们不但能开门红，而且能月月红、季季红、红到底！
    要知道，开门红初获胜利，稳定地持续地上升的客观规律已经掌握了，主动权就操在我们手里。开门红使我们赢得了时间，这个时间能够用来增加生产和为下一步生产作好准备。高速度就是要赢得时间，赢得时间就是胜利。现在的问题是只要我们继续鼓足革命的干劲，充分运用这种主动权，不断地赢得时间，那我们就可以势如破竹地进一步夺取满堂红、红到底的全面胜利。
