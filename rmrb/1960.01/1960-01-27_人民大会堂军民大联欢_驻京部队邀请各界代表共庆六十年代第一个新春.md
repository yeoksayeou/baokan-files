    More than 17,000 leading cadres from various departments of the central government, democratic parties, people's organizations, and Beijing municipal departments, as well as representatives of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, were invited to attend tonight's party.

    Generals from the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Military Region, and the leading organs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as responsible officers from various organs and units, attended as guests.

    Tonight, the Great Hall of the People was filled with festive joy. The grand auditorium and the halls and corridors on each floor were filled with joyful crowds. Some danced together in the banquet hall, some enjoyed wonderful music, ballads, acrobatics, and Peking opera, some watched movies, shadow plays, and puppet shows, and some engaged in various favorite recreational activities, enjoying themselves until late at night.

    Xinhua News Agency, 26th: On the eve of the Spring Festival, various organs, troops, and military academies stationed in Beijing enthusiastically launched large-scale traditional activities to support the government and cherish the people.

    In recent days, the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army and the leading organs, troops, and military academies of various services and arms have organized hundreds of Spring Festival New Year visiting teams and propaganda teams, carrying New Year pictures, Spring Festival couplets, congratulatory letters, and various gifts such as pork and candy, to visit people's communes, factories, schools, government organs, and families of martyrs and soldiers, and model workers in the urban and suburban areas, congratulating them on their significant contributions to the great leap forward in the socialist construction of the motherland. The literary and art work troupes and film projection teams of various units performed wonderful programs and screened excellent films for the masses. Many units also organized amateur performance teams to perform in factories, schools, and people's communes.

    The officers and soldiers of various units also universally launched a campaign to do "one good deed" for the people's communes. Filled with joy, they actively participated in various labor tasks in the local people's communes, such as building water conservancy projects, repairing farm tools, vigorously developing fertilizer, and cleaning up sanitation, undeterred by the cold weather. Students and officers of a certain military school recently worked continuously for two days to fully support the Yongfeng People's Commune in excavating irrigation canal projects and sent a mechanical repair team to help the commune repair tractors and farm tools in preparation for spring plowing. A certain air force repair plant recently discussed cooperation contracts for this year's Great Leap Forward with more than ten units, including communes, farms, and factories, determined to make greater contributions to industrial and agricultural production.

    In order to further promote the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army and further strengthen the relationship between the military and the government and between the military and the people, the troops stationed in Beijing and the local people's governments and masses held symposiums, report meetings, and get-together parties to examine the implementation of mass discipline, solicit opinions on the troops, and introduce each other's heroic deeds in defending and building the motherland. The troops also launched a "letter" campaign, encouraging family members and relatives to strive to be models in the Great Leap Forward.
