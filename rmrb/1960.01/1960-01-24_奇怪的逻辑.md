    Strange Logic
    Poetry by Chi Bei'ou, Cartoon by Fang Cheng
    Former British Prime Minister Eden recently said on a television program: "As far as the free world is concerned, colonialism today is trusteeship," "Now there is only one colonial country left, and that is the Soviet Union."
    A white horse is not a horse,
    A toad is not a frog,
    A murderer is not a killer,
    The United States, Britain, France, etc., are not colonial countries.
    The Stars and Stripes are flying all over the world,
    Britain still has two million square miles of colonies,
    French troops continue to massacre in Algeria,
    None of this is colonialism.
    Belgian authorities chop off the limbs of the Congolese people,
    Portugal owns hundreds of thousands of slaves in Black Africa,
    The Netherlands is still clinging to West Irian...
    None of this is colonialism.
    Western colonialism is a trusteeship,
    Trusteeship is freedom and democracy,
    Freedom and democracy are great things,
    Everyone should cheer for colonialism.
    It is said that the Soviet Union is the only colonial country,
    Is it because it is vigorously developing its own resources?
    Is it because it has deprived people of the right to exploit people?
    Or is it because it is realizing the grand "Seven-Year Plan"?
    What strange logic!
    What absurd ravings!
    Is Eden running a high fever,
    Otherwise, why would he talk such nonsense? (Attached picture)

    奇怪的逻辑
    池北偶诗　方成画
    英国前首相艾登最近在电视节目中说：“就自由世界而论，今天的殖民主义就是托管制”，“现在只剩下苏联一个殖民国家了”。
    白马非马，
    蛤蟆不是青蛙，
    杀人犯并非凶手，
    美英法等都不是殖民国家。
    世界各处飘扬着星条旗，
    英国殖民地还有二百万平方英里，
    法国军队在阿尔及利亚继续屠杀，
    这都不是殖民主义。
    比利时当局砍掉刚果人民的四肢，
    葡萄牙在黑非洲拥有几十万奴隶，
    荷兰至今死抓住西伊里安不放……
    这都不是殖民主义。
    西方的殖民主义就是托管制度，
    托管制度就是自由民主，
    自由民主是大好事情，
    大家应当为殖民主义欢呼。
    据说只有苏联是唯一的殖民国家，
    是因为它对自己的资源大力开发？
    是因为它剥夺了人剥削人的权利？
    还是因为它在实现宏伟的“七年计划”？
    真是奇怪的逻辑！
    真是荒唐的梦呓！
    艾登难道是在发高烧，
    不然为什么这样语无伦次？（附图片）
