    Strive to Make This Year Better Than Last Year
    By Our Correspondent Li Nan

    Good News Keeps Pouring in from the Production Front

    As they celebrate the New Year of 1960, the Soviet working people have set lofty aspirations and are filled with a spirit of striving forward. One sentence best represents this joyful and hopeful mood: "The first year of the Seven-Year Plan went wonderfully for us, and this year we will surpass last year in all aspects." Encouraged by this sentiment, the Soviet production fronts have been reporting good news right from the start of the year, with a surge of competition that surpasses even the enthusiastic scenes at the beginning of the Seven-Year Plan last year.

    The 1960 Soviet production and construction plan is another plan for accelerated progress. Last year, the originally planned growth rate for the national economy was 7.7%. This year, the planned growth rate is already 8.1%. The production tasks for steel, electricity, petroleum, machinery manufacturing, as well as light industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, have all been significantly increased compared to last year. The total investment in national economic construction is 523 billion rubles, a leap of 38.7 billion rubles compared to last year. Investment in the chemical industry has surged by more than 30% compared to last year, investment in machinery manufacturing has also increased by about 30%, the metallurgical industry has increased by 20%, and the oil and gas industry by 15%. This year, the state plans to use 80 billion rubles to accelerate technological progress in new technologies. A large amount of new equipment will be put into production, and the large-scale modernization of existing equipment will be accelerated. The tasks of increasing labor productivity and reducing costs have also been significantly increased. Encouraged by the December plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee last year, the rising trend in agriculture and animal husbandry this year has emerged earlier than expected. Basic construction, the construction industry, and transportation all show promising prospects. The Soviet Union's blueprint for production and construction this year makes the working people ecstatic, and they are all brimming with confidence as they throw themselves into new battles.

    New Initiatives Follow One Another

    The various initiatives and competitions proposed by various industrial sectors in the Soviet Union during the first year of the Seven-Year Plan have been one after another, creating a magnificent spectacle. Although less than a month has passed this year, the spirit of innovation, creation, and initiative-taking demonstrated by the working people is even greater than last year.

    The first initiative to receive the support and commendation of the CPSU Central Committee was the initiative of the New Kramatorsk Heavy Machinery Factory to accelerate the modernization of existing equipment. This factory proposed that the factory should be responsible for modernizing all machinery and equipment produced by the factory in the past. This year, the factory will manufacture 3,000 tons of modernized existing equipment installations above the plan. The factory plans to modernize two rolling mills used in the Zaporozhye and Zhdanov steel plants in the second and third quarters of this year, which will increase the annual rolling capacity by 1.5 million tons, equivalent to building a new rolling mill, saving 130 million rubles. The factory also plans to modernize a steel pipe machine used in the Caucasus Steel Plant, which will increase the annual production capacity of steel pipes by 200,000 tons.

    This initiative has been promoted throughout the country. Factories and enterprises producing machinery and equipment have proactively taken on the responsibility of innovating the factory's past products. As a result of modernizing equipment this year with the help of the machine manufacturing industry, the textile factories of the Russian Federation will be able to spin more than 50,000 tons of yarn and weave more than 200 million meters of cloth, which would cost 1 billion rubles to build several factories to achieve such a large output.

    The competition initiative to establish steel reserves outside the plan for the country has also been launched. The steelmaking workers of the Makhote production team of the Dnepropetrovsk Steel Plant initiated this proposal. They suggested that at least 500 tons of steel should be invested in the steel reserves. The Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works proposed to invest 100,000 tons in the surplus steel reserves. The Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Works decided to invest 60,000 tons of steel and 25,000 tons of rolled steel.

    In addition to steel, the country also needs more oil reserves and machine reserves beyond the plan. To support agriculture, there is a need for automobiles, electric motors, and tractors outside the plan. The Stalingrad Tractor Factory decided to produce 3,000 tractors above the plan this year. The Moscow Dynamo Factory decided to produce 3,000 more electric motors.

    The competition initiatives proposed at the beginning of this year can be said to be meticulous and comprehensive. For example, the plan to comprehensively improve labor productivity proposed by the Kirov Factory in Leningrad, the initiative to complete the three-year savings plan in one and a half years proposed by the Sherbakov Textile Factory in Moscow, and the personal cost reduction plan proposed by female workers in the Frunze Factory, all demonstrate the great determination of the Soviet people to greet the second year of the Seven-Year Plan, strive for achievements that surpass last year, and strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan more quickly than expected.

    Amidst a wave of competition initiatives, the Moscow and Leningrad economic regions recently proposed a comprehensive competition plan with an even higher step, the characteristic of this initiative is that the industrial, construction, and transportation enterprises of the two places, the workers, staff, engineers, and technicians of the two places all participate in the competition. The two cities comprehensively proposed a comprehensive plan to accelerate technological progress, improve labor productivity, and complete this year's and the entire Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This comprehensive plan makes this year's competition even richer and more colorful.

    Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Continue to Advance

    Last year, the Soviet Union won a beautiful victory on the livestock front. At the beginning of this year, the mood of agricultural workers was boiling, setting off a wave to surpass last year and catch up with Ryazan.

    Ryazan Oblast ranked first because it exceeded its meat production target by two times. Soon after the New Year, Tula, Omsk and other oblasts issued challenges. Tula Oblast plans to produce and hand over twice as much meat to the state this year as it did last year, resolving to complete the seven-year plan for animal husbandry four years ahead of schedule.

    As early as the end of last year, some southern states proposed to complete the seven-year plan task for animal husbandry in four years. At that time, it received warm applause from the people. Less than a month has passed, and now new and bolder calls for shock are being issued from various regions. Not four or five years, but only three, two and a half, or even two years will be needed to complete the seven-year task. People say well: with one Ryazan Oblast, there will be ten or a hundred Ryazan Oblasts; with ten or a hundred Ryazan Oblasts, a rapid pace can be created.

    Ryazan Oblast must use its labor enthusiasm to surpass last year in order to maintain last year's honor. Ryazan Oblast's target for this year is to produce 260,000 tons of meat and hand over 200,000 tons to the state. According to this speed, the seven-year plan for livestock products can be overfulfilled next year. The agricultural workers of Ryazan Oblast wrote in their resolution: "We understand that this year's task is huge and the responsibility is not light. We must work even harder than last year."

    Republics and various states are revising their original targets and proposing new and higher plans. At present, the most outstanding is the Moldavian Republic, which can complete the seven-year plan output of milk this year, handing over 360,000 tons of milk to the state. The collective farms and farms of the Byelorussian Republic, which have not always been at the forefront of meat production, have also proposed to complete the seven-year plan next year.

    Dozens and hundreds of Ryazan Oblasts will grow up this year. For example, the Kostroma Oblast on the banks of the Volga River decided at the meeting of representatives of collective farmers, farm workers, and agricultural experts that the whole state will complete three annual plans for meat delivery this year, eleven districts will complete three and a half annual plans, and some advanced agricultural societies will complete five annual plans. Gorky Oblast decided to hand over meat to the state this year equal to two and a half times the original plan for this year, and more than a dozen advanced districts will reach three times. This speed of multiple growth has created a new situation in animal husbandry, as the "Pravda" said, "These states' initiatives are major events in the life of collective farm villages."

    Like animal husbandry, other sectors of agriculture are also moving towards the goals of the seven-year plan, taking this year as a crucial year. Now, various regions are looking for ways to increase production, looking for their own "virgin lands." The potential of the land on the plains of the Kyrgyz Republic is not great, but the area that can be developed in the Tianshan Plateau is quite abundant. Kyrgyzstan is launching a movement to march into the Tianshan Mountains. Some republics in the southwest with a lot of marshland take the development of marshland as the "virgin land" for potential springs. In the Ukrainian Republic, last winter and this spring, farmers overcame the severe cold and cleared more than 100,000 hectares of marshland as pastures and cultivated land. The task of developing 200,000 hectares of hillside land in the seven-year plan of the Moldavian Republic will also be completed ahead of schedule in the near future.

    Recently, many regions have proposed to increase the yield by an average of three to four quintals per hectare this year to ensure that the goal of 10 billion to 11 billion poods of grain is reached quickly. The cotton and industrial crop producing areas are also proposing new plans. Azerbaijan, which is rich in tobacco production, decided to complete the seven-year plan for tobacco production next year.

    From these examples, it can be seen how great the enthusiasm and determination of the Soviet agricultural workers are, and they will surely achieve fruitful results this year that surpass last year.

    Complete the Seven-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule

    For advanced producers in industry and agriculture, 1960 will be an extraordinary year, because this year will be the year when more winners of the competition to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule will begin to appear. The advanced producers are determined to take the 1965 targets. The words "reached the 1965 limit" often appear in newspapers.

    There are already thousands of workers in Leningrad, and many workers in Moscow and many important industrial areas have reached the labor productivity target of 1965. Vechnova, a textile worker from Ivanovo Oblast, was the first to reach the level of the last year stipulated in the seven-year plan in terms of equipment utilization. Following her example, 9,000 textile workers in Ivanovo Oblast quickly increased their productivity. The textile factory named after Krupskaya in this state reached the seven-year plan standard in terms of equipment utilization. More than 600 female workers in the Bolshevsk Textile Factory in Moscow Oblast are already working with the labor productivity of 1965. The doublers in this factory are now doubling 84 kilograms of yarn per work shift, far exceeding the 1965 level stipulated in the seven-year plan. Many female workers have already achieved 36.8 kilograms of yarn output per hour for 1,000 spindles, while the standard stipulated in the last year of the seven-year plan is 31.7 kilograms. The Kalinin State Textile United Factory, where the hero of socialist labor Gaganova works, reached the level of equipment utilization in 1965 at the beginning of this year because it eliminated backward work teams. Such examples encourage people to move forward bravely. The movement to learn from Vechnova's example has not only been launched in the textile industry, but has gradually appeared in other industrial sectors.

    In terms of agriculture and animal husbandry, many breeders and milkers have also exerted unparalleled creative power and reached the final targets of the Seven-Year Plan. The female workers of the Orzhonikidze District Lenin Agricultural Society in the Uzbek Republic milked an average of 4,000 kilograms per cow from 210 dairy cows, which is the figure for the last year of the seven-year plan. The most advanced milkers, Kaminova and Kasemova, reached a higher standard of milking more than 5,000 kilograms per cow. For example, the famous Ukrainian breeder Qidi alone raises more than 1,000 pigs, the Latvian breeder Bartulis alone raises 3,000 pigs, and the Moscow Oblast breeder Soseeva alone takes care of 150 dairy cows, all reaching the highest standards stipulated in the seven-year plan.

    The Soviet people will make the second year of the Seven-Year Plan better than the first year of the Seven-Year Plan. Spring has not yet arrived, but the active situation at the beginning of the second year makes people forget the severe cold and smell the breath of spring.

    争取今年胜去年
    本报记者　李楠
    生产战线捷报频传
    在欢庆1960年新年的日子里，苏联劳动人民立下雄心壮志，心头洋溢着奋发前进的情绪。有一句话最能代表这种充满欢愉和希望的心境：“七年计划第一年，我们的事业一切都美好，今年各方面又要赛过去年。”在这种心情鼓舞下，今年一开头，苏联各个生产战线上都捷报频传，竞赛巨浪高涨，胜过了去年七年计划开头时的热烈场面。
    1960年苏联的生产和建设计划又是一个加速前进的计划。去年原定的国民经济增长计划是增长7．7％。今年增长计划已是8．1％。钢铁、电力、石油、机器制造，以及轻工业、农业、畜牧业方面各项产品今年的生产任务都比去年提高很多。国民经济建设的总投资数目是五千二百三十多亿卢布，比去年跃增三百八十七亿卢布。化学工业的投资比去年猛增30％以上，机器制造业的投资也增加约30％，冶金工业提高20％，石油和瓦斯工业是15％。今年在新技术方面，国家准备用八百亿卢布来加速技术进步。大量的新设备将投入生产，大规模使现有设备现代化的工作将加速进行。提高劳动生产率和降低成本的任务也增加很多。经过去年十二月苏共中央全会的鼓舞，农业畜牧业今年高涨的形势已提早出现。基本建设、建筑工业、交通运输都展现了高涨前景。苏联今年生产和建设的蓝图使劳动人民心花怒放，他们无一不信心百倍地投入新的战斗。
    新倡议接踵而来
    七年计划第一年苏联各工业部门所提出的各种倡议和竞赛，已经一个接一个，蔚为大观。今年虽然才过去不到一个月，但是劳动人民所表现出来的革新创造和倡议竞赛精神又比去年大大提高。
    首先获得苏共中央支持和表扬的是新克拉马托尔斯克重型机器工厂的加速现有设备现代化的倡议。这个厂提议：凡是过去工厂出产的机器设备，都由工厂担负起现代化的责任。今年工厂将超计划制造三千吨现代化现有设备的装置。工厂准备在今年二、三季度把在扎波罗什和日丹诺夫两钢铁厂使用的两部轧钢机现代化，这样就能使轧钢能力年增一百五十万吨，等于盖一个新轧钢厂，将节约一亿三千万卢布。工厂还准备把在高加索钢铁厂使用的一部钢管机现代化，这样就能增加年产二十万吨钢管的能力。
    这个倡议已在各地推广。生产机器设备的工厂企业纷纷主动担负起革新工厂过去产品的责任。俄罗斯联邦纺织工厂今年在机器制造业的帮助下使设备现代化的结果，就能多纺出五万多吨纱，织出二亿多米布，要花十亿卢布盖几个工厂才能得到这么大的产量。
    为国家建立计划以外的钢铁储备的竞赛倡议也同样已经开展起来了。第聂伯彼得罗夫斯克钢铁工厂炼钢工人马霍特生产班发起了这一创议。他们建议至少要在钢铁储备中投入五百吨钢。马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁厂提出要在超计划钢铁储备中投入十万吨。下塔吉尔钢铁厂决定要投入六万吨钢，两万五千吨轧钢。
    除了钢铁以外，国家还需要超计划以外的更多的石油储备，机器储备。为支援农业，需要计划以外的汽车、电动机、拖拉机。斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂决定今年超计划生产三千部拖拉机。莫斯科吉纳摩工厂决定多生产三千部电动机。
    今年年初提出的竞赛倡议真可以说是细致周到。例如列宁格勒基洛夫工厂提出的全面提高劳动生产率的计划，莫斯科谢尔巴科夫纺织厂提出的用一年半时间完成三年节约计划的倡议，伏龙芝工厂女工提出的个人降低成本的计划，都表明了苏联人民以多么大的决心迎接七年计划第二年，争取今年赛过去年的成就，争取比预料更迅速地完成七年计划。
    在一片竞赛倡议声中，莫斯科和列宁格勒市两经济区最近提出全面竞赛方案，竞赛内容更提高一步，这一倡议的特点是两地的工业、建筑、运输企业，两地的工人、职员、工程技术人员都参加竞赛。两市综合提出了全面加速技术进步，提高劳动生产率，提前完成今年和整个七年计划的综合方案。这一综合方案使今年的竞赛更加丰富多采。
    农牧业继续前进
    去年，苏联在畜牧业战线上打了一个漂亮的大胜仗。今年一开年，农业劳动者的心情就沸腾了起来，掀起一个超去年、赶梁赞的热潮。
    梁赞州因为超额两倍完成肉类生产而名列前茅。新年一过，图拉、鄂木斯克等州就发出了挑战。图拉州今年计划生产和交给国家的肉类要比大丰收的去年提高两倍，决心提前四年完成畜牧业的七年计划。
    还在去年年底，南方的一些州提出用四年的时间完成畜牧业七年计划任务。当时曾获得人们的热烈喝采。事情过去还不到一个月，现在新的更勇敢的突击号召又从各个地区发出。不要四年、五年，只要用三年、两年半，乃至两年的时间就能完成七年的任务。人们说得好：有了一个梁赞州，就会有十个百个梁赞州；有了十个百个梁赞州，就能创造出飞快的速度。
    梁赞州今年要用赛过去年的劳动热情才能保持去年的荣誉。梁赞州今年提出的目标是生产肉类二十六万吨，上缴国家二十万吨。根据这样速度，明年就可以超额完成畜产品的七年计划。梁赞州的农业劳动者们在决心书中写道：“我们了解今年的任务是巨大的、责任不轻的。我们还必须比去年更加劲地劳动”。
    共和国和各个州都在修改原订的指标，提出新的更高的计划。目前，最出色的是摩尔达维亚共和国，今年全共和国就可以完成牛奶的七年计划产量，交给国家三十六万吨牛奶。一向在肉类生产上不是走在前面的白俄罗斯共和国的农庄、农场，也提出要在明年完成七年计划。
    成十成百个梁赞州要在今年内成长起来。例如伏尔加河岸上的科斯特罗马州在集体农民、农场工人、农业专家的代表会议上决定今年全州要完成三个肉类交售的年度计划，十一个区要完成三个半年度计划，一些先进的农庄要完成五个年度计划。高尔基州决定今年要交给国家的肉类等于原订今年计划的两倍半，十多个先进区要达到三倍。这样成倍增长的速度，开创了畜牧业中的新局面，正如“真理报”所说的一样，“这些州的创议是集体农庄农村生活中的重大事件”。
    和畜牧业一样，农业的其他部门，也在向七年计划的目标前进，把今年作为关键性的年头。现在，各个地区都在寻找增产的道路，寻找自己的“处女地”。吉尔吉斯共和国平原上土地的潜力不大，但天山高原中可以开发的面积却相当丰富。吉尔吉斯正在发起一个向天山进军的运动。西南部地区一些沼泽地特别多的共和国就把开发沼泽地作为潜力泉源的“处女地”。在乌克兰共和国，去冬今春农民们战胜天寒地冻，整理出十多万公顷沼泽地作为牧场和耕地。摩尔达维亚共和国七年计划要开发二十万公顷山坡地，这一任务也将在最近提前完成。
    最近不少地区都提出今年要在平均每公顷土地上多三到四公担收成，以保证迅速到达一百亿到一百一十亿普特谷物的目标。棉花和技术作物的产区也正在提出新的计划。盛产烟草的阿塞拜疆决定明年就完成烟草生产的七年计划。
    从这些事例中可以看出苏联农业劳动者的热情和决心是多么巨大，他们今年一定会获得胜过去年的丰硕的成果。
    提前完成七年计划
    对于工农业中的先进生产者来说，1960年将是一个不平凡的年头，因为这一年将是开始更多地出现争取提前完成七年计划的竞赛优胜者的一年。先进生产者们，都在决心拿下1965年的指标。报纸上经常出现“达到了1965年的界限”的字样。
    列宁格勒已经有几千名工人，莫斯科和许多重要工业地区都有许多工人达到了1965年的劳动生产率的指标。伊凡诺夫州的纺织女工维契诺娃最先在设备利用率方面达到了七年计划规定的最后一年的水平。紧接着她的榜样，伊凡诺夫州已有九千名纺织女工迅速提高了生产率。这个州的以克鲁普斯卡娅命名的纺织厂，全厂在设备利用率方面达到了七年计划的标准。莫斯科州波尔歇夫斯克纺织工厂已有六百多名女工在用1965年的劳动生产率工作。这个厂的并纱女工现在每工作班并纱八十四公斤，已把七年计划规定的1965年水平远远抛在后面。不少的女工已做到一千纱锭每小时出纱三十六点八公斤，而七年计划最后一年规定的标准是三十一点七公斤。社会主义劳动英雄加干诺娃工作的加里宁州纺织联合工厂，由于消灭了落后工作队，今年年初全厂已达到1965年的设备利用率水平。这样的事例鼓舞着人们奋勇地前进。学习维契诺娃榜样的运动已经不止在纺织业中开展，而且逐渐在其他工业部门出现了。
    在农牧业方面，也有许多饲养员、挤奶员等发挥了无比的创造力量，达到了七年计划的最后指标。乌兹别克共和国奥尔忠尼启则区列宁农庄饲养场的女工们，从二百一十条乳牛身上平均每条牛挤奶四千公斤，这是七年计划最后一年的数字。最先进的挤奶员卡敏诺娃和卡塞莫娃达到了每头牛挤奶五千多公斤的更高的标准。再如著名的乌克兰饲养员契季一人喂养一千多条猪，拉脱维亚饲养员巴尔图利斯一人喂养三千头猪，莫斯科州的饲养员索色也娃一人照看一百五十条奶牛，都达到七年计划规定的最高标准。
    苏联人民将要使七年计划的第二年胜过七年计划的第一年。现在春天还没有来到，但第二年开头各方面活跃的情况使人忘记了严寒，闻到了春天的气息。
