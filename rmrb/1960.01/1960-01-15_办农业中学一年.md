Running an Agricultural Middle School for a Year
Hu Renfu, Principal of Zhoushi Agricultural Middle School, Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province

I come from a farming background and have always been involved in production, serving as a Party branch secretary and production team leader. At the end of 1958, the commune Party committee transferred me to be the principal of an agricultural middle school.

What was the school like when it was placed before me at that time? The school framework had been set up, but there were still many problems. Some teachers and students were ideologically unstable due to insufficient understanding of agricultural middle schools. Enrollment was not stable, and discipline was lax. Students came when they were happy and didn’t come when they weren’t. There were also significant problems with productive labor. A series of issues, such as school buildings, desks, and funding, had not been resolved well. Facing these situations, there were so many things to handle, and I didn’t know where to start. I thought about it day and night, always wanting to solve all these problems at once. I convened a general meeting of all teachers and students, mobilizing teachers to teach well, students to study hard, and to do a good job in labor, to make the school look presentable. Regarding production, at first, I thought that I had led a large team in the past, managing thousands of mu of land, increasing production every year. Managing these small dozens of mu of land would be easy! But when I came into contact with reality, the problem was not that simple. We lacked everything, the tools were incomplete, and the labor force could not be organized. I couldn't use my strength. After working for almost a month, there was no progress, and it was still a mess. Seeing these situations, I felt sad, my head was throbbing, and my confidence began to waver. I thought: "A roughneck is still a roughneck. I can’t handle this kind of meticulous work. I should go back to my old profession to play a greater role in the revolution."

Later, I reported my ideological situation to the commune Party committee and requested to be transferred back to the production team. After listening to my report, the commune Party committee talked to me. What touched me most was the discussion about the pre-liberation era. At that time, we poor people didn't have money to study, and we became illiterate. After liberation, my lack of education brought many difficulties to my work. Secretary Hu said: "As long as you think about why you didn't have an education and the suffering of being uneducated, and then think about why the Party wants to run agricultural middle schools today, that will be good." These words were more painful than a severe criticism.

Then, I participated in a meeting of agricultural middle school teacher and student representatives in the county, which gave me great inspiration and encouragement. In this way, under the education and help of the Party, I gained tremendous strength and re-established my determination and confidence in running the agricultural middle school well.

After returning to school, I carefully studied the specific situations of several teachers. I found that the most critical reason for their restlessness was a lack of clear understanding of the important significance and future of agricultural middle schools. Based on these situations, I organized the teachers to study Minister Lu Dingyi's and Provincial Party Secretary Chen Guang's articles on agricultural middle schools and launched a discussion on the nature and tasks of agricultural middle schools. At the same time, I also had very sincere individual conversations with some teachers. I found that Communist Youth League member Jiang Quansheng was very settled in his work and very active, so I praised and encouraged him. As a result, a positive atmosphere gradually developed among the teachers, and they were able to settle down and focus on teaching.

When carrying out the work of the teachers, I always kept firmly in mind to put politics in command and let ideology lead. At the same time, I also felt that I had to delve into teaching, otherwise, ideological leadership would still fall flat. But what if I don’t understand the profession? I remembered the two magic weapons the Party gave me: relying on the masses and learning humbly. Whenever I had time, I would go to listen to teachers' lectures, so that I could learn culture and improve myself, and also understand the teachers' teaching situation. Once, I went to listen to a hygiene class. The teacher was just talking about the methods of eliminating the four pests according to the textbook, without relating it to reality. After class, I asked the students, and they all said the lecture was very boring. I raised the issue of linking to reality among the teachers, which aroused everyone's attention.

Encouraged and educated by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, teachers and students realized the important role of agricultural middle schools in realizing the mechanization, irrigation, and electrification of the commune. Most teachers have established the idea of "being red in agricultural middle school and specialized in agricultural middle school," and their enthusiasm is higher, their energy is greater, and their teaching attitude is more serious. Students also developed feelings for the school, loved the school as their home, and the quality of learning continued to improve.

In the past year, under the leadership of the Party and with the enthusiastic support of the masses, our Zhoushi Agricultural Middle School has quickly been established and grown. Last summer, the average score of all students in Chinese was 85, arithmetic was 75, and agricultural knowledge, physics, and hygiene were all around 80. The 42 mu of pumpkins planted by the school yielded 3,025 jin per mu, an increase of about 50% compared to the local general fields. The best four mu yielded 4,200 jin per mu. Now the school has achieved "three self-sufficiency" in teachers' salaries, school administrative expenses, student notebook fees, and food expenses. The medical expenses of all teachers and students are also covered by the school.

I have also been well-trained in this year. What I have learned the most is that as long as you closely rely on the leadership of the Party, listen to the Party, and wholeheartedly fight for the revolutionary cause to the end, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. In future work, I must better listen to the Party, closely rely on the masses, learn humbly, and complete the tasks assigned to me by the Party: I must run the agricultural middle school well!

    办农业中学一年
    江苏昆山县周市农业中学校长　胡仁福
    我是种田出身，一直搞生产，当过党支部书记和生产大队长。1958年底，公社党委调我到农业中学当校长。
    那时，放在我面前的学校是怎样的呢？学校架子是搭起来了，但问题还是一大堆。部分教师、学生由于对农中认识不够，思想不安定。学额不巩固，学习纪律很松弛。学生高兴来就来，不高兴来就不来。生产劳动问题也很大。校舍、课桌、经费等一连串的问题，都没有很好解决。面对着这些情况，真是千头万绪，不知道从何下手是好。我白天想，黑夜想，总想一口气把这些问题全部解决。我召开了一个全体师生大会，动员教师教好书，学生学好功课，还要搞好劳动，把学校搞得像个样。在生产方面，起先我以为过去领导一个大队，几千亩田的生产也能搞好，年年增产；搞这小小几十亩地，那还不是轻松的事情！但一接触到实际，问题并不那么简单。要啥没啥，工具残缺不全，劳动力组织不起来，有力没处使。这样，搞了差不多一个月，一点头绪也没有，还是一团糟。我看到这些情况心里难过，头脑发胀，信心也开始动摇起来。心里想：“老粗终究是老粗，这种细生活搞不来，还是干老本行，对革命能发挥更大作用。”
    以后，我向公社党委汇报了我的思想情况，要求调回大队去。公社党委听了我的汇报后，给我谈了话。其中使我最感动的是谈到解放前的事。那时，我们穷人没有钱读书，变成了睁眼瞎子。解放后自己没有文化，给工作带来很多困难。胡书记说：“只要你想想自己为什么没有文化，以及没有文化的苦，再想想今天党为什么要办农中，那就好了。”这些话，比狠狠批评我一顿还要难过。
    接着，我又到县里参加了农业中学师生代表会议，得到了很大的启发和鼓舞。就这样，在党的教育和帮助下，使我获得了巨大的力量，重新树立起了办好农业中学的决心和信心。
    回校以后，我仔细研究了几个教师的具体情况。发现他们不安心的原因，其中最最关键的是由于对农业中学的重要意义和前途认识不清楚。根据这些情况，我就组织教师学习了陆定一部长和省委陈光书记有关农业中学的文章，展开了关于农业中学性质、任务的讨论。在这同时，还和一部分教师进行了很恳切的个别交谈。我发现共青团员蒋泉生工作很安心，也很积极，就对他进行表扬和鼓励。于是，积极向上的正气，在教师中逐步树立起来，教师们都能安下心来搞教学了。
    在进行教师的工作时，我总是牢牢记着要政治挂帅，思想领先。同时，也感觉到要深入到教学中去，否则，思想领先还是要落空的。但我不懂业务怎么办？我又记起了党给我的两个法宝，就是依靠群众和虚心学习。一有空，我就去听教师讲课，这样一则可以学习文化，提高自己；二则也可以了解教师的教学情况。有一次我去听卫生课，教师在讲除四害方法的时候，只是按照课本上讲，不联系实际，课后我问学生，都说讲得很枯燥。我就把联系实际的问题在教师中提出来，引起了大家的重视。
    在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞和教育下，教师和学生认识到农业中学对公社实现机械化、水利化和电气化的重要作用。大部分教师已经树立起“红在农中，专在农中”的思想，热情更高，干劲更足，教学态度也更认真了。学生对学校也产生了感情，爱校如家，学习质量不断提高。
    一年来，我们周市农中在党的领导下，在群众的热情支持下，已很快地健全和成长起来了。去年夏天，全校学生语文成绩平均是八十五分，算术七十五分，农业知识、物理和卫生课都在八十分上下。学校种的四十二亩南瓜，亩产三千零二十五斤，比当地一般田增产50％左右，最好的四亩田亩产达到四千二百斤。如今学校已经实现了教师工资、学校行政费用、学生簿本费和伙食费的“三自给”。全校师生的医药费用，也由学校包了下来。
    我在这一年中，也得到了很好的锻炼。使我体会最深的是：任何工作只要紧紧依靠党的领导，听党的话，全心全意为革命事业奋斗到底，那就没有克服不了的困难。在今后工作中，我一定要更好地听党的话，紧紧依靠群众，虚心学习，完成党所交给我的任务：一定要把农中办好！
