According to the Changjiang Daily, "Fight for 'Zero'! Eliminate defects, eliminate rework, eliminate industrial accidents!" This is the initiative proposed by the workers of Wuhan Machine Tool Accessories Factory to the workers of Wuhan's electromechanical system during the public relations campaign organized in December last year. They quickly and heroically realized this initiative. From December 25 last year to January 7 this year, the factory's defect rate was below 1% for eleven consecutive days, only a few tenths of a percent; the defect rate of machining and forging has remained "below zero" until now. At the same time, the factory's output has increased exponentially, and man-hours and raw materials have been greatly saved. The man-hours saved by machining in December last year alone were equivalent to the workload of three machine tools for a month. From December 15 last year to the present, the factory has eliminated equipment and personal accidents, achieving a full house of high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safety.

In the past, the factory's defect rate was relatively high. The average casting defect rate was 19% in November last year, and the machining defect rate was generally around 6% to 7%. In early December last year, the factory launched a climax of learning from Ma Xueli on the basis of thoroughly carrying out the anti-rightist struggle and conducting general line education, and the communist style was greatly promoted. Subsequently, the factory's Party committee implemented the instructions of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Party Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Electromechanical Industry, launched a public relations campaign aimed at comprehensively catching up with the advanced and changing the appearance at high speed, launched a major attack on quality, called on workers to learn from the experience of Wuchang Machine Factory, fought for "zero," and reduced the factory's defect rate to zero. Before organizing the zero-defect day, the factory leaders repeatedly studied the specific methods and steps to achieve a zero defect rate, and the party, government, labor union, and youth league leaders and engineering technicians formed a promotion group to go to the workshop to check and solve problems. The workshops also issued targets and requirements, checked tools, cards, measuring tools, and checked equipment and semi-finished product reserves. At zero o'clock on December 15, a fierce battle to seize "zero" began. Because the spirit of Ma Xueli took root in the minds of workers, everyone cherished collective honor, and the whole factory worked with one heart and one mind, fighting for "zero." Everyone repeatedly urged comrades who were prone to produce defects. Some machine tools were operated by apprentices, and the workers on the front and rear machine tools took the initiative to take care of and actively help. Finally, on the 15th, machining ensured no defects, no rework, and no safety accidents. This initiative broke superstition, and the casting workshop also achieved a full day of no defects on the 17th. The factory's Party committee further proposed to achieve "zero" by the end of the year, realize "four no's" (no defects, no rework, no accidents, no errors) to welcome the opening red, and consolidate the good practices created during the no-defect day from the system, such as improving the handover system and pre-shift and post-shift meetings, defect analysis meetings, etc. Now the factory has launched various forms of competitions such as "production games" and "ball games" to consolidate mass enthusiasm and strive to maintain no defects.

In the public relations campaign, fighting for "zero," the workers vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution. The Liu Diyuan group of the fourth workshop manufactured a native-made broaching machine, which solved the key problem that the Class A hole of the gear could not meet the quality requirements. The tool workshop realized the mechanization of sample processing. In the past, only five samples were made per week, and there were 30% to 40% defects. Now, the work efficiency has been increased by eighty times, and the defects have been eliminated. The technical inspection section created precision measuring tools and inspection instruments to ensure high-speed inspection and eliminate errors. They also broke with conventions and implemented "red inspection" of forgings, promptly discovered quality problems, and promptly reworked them.

In this battle, the enterprise's management work was comprehensively strengthened. The work of the sections was comprehensively reformed. Technical personnel beat gongs and drums to send technology to the workshops, so that major problems would not be left overnight, and minor problems would not be left for more than an hour. Inspection personnel inspected at the side of the machine tool, inspecting one as it was made, so that the workers knew what they were doing. The staff of the equipment and power section used the time when workers were eating and parking to rush to repair equipment. Some people also went deep into the workshops and groups of cooperative units to help solve the quality problems of cooperative parts.

    学习马学礼风格　大搞攻关运动
    武汉机床附件厂废品率降到1％以下
    据长江日报消息　为“零”而战！消灭废品，消灭返工，消灭工伤事故！这是武汉机床附件厂职工在去年12月组织攻关战役中，向武汉市机电系统职工提出的倡议。他们迅速地豪迈地实现了这项倡议，从去年12月25日到今年1月7日，全厂十一天废品率都在1％以下，只有百分之零点几；机械加工和锻造的废品率直到现在还保持在“零下”。与此同时，全厂产量成倍增长，工时和原材料大为节约，仅机械加工去年12月份节约的工时，就等于增加了三台机床一个月的工作量。全厂从去年12月15日到现在，消灭了设备、人身事故，实现了高产、优质、低耗、安全满堂红。
    过去，这个厂的废品率比较高。铸造废品率去年11月份平均为19％，机械加工废品率一般在6％到7％左右。去年12月初，这个厂在深入开展反右倾斗争和进行总路线教育的基础上，掀起了学习马学礼的高潮，共产主义风格大大发扬。接着，工厂党委执行中共武汉市委和武汉市机电局党委的指示，开展了以全面赶先进，高速度改变面貌为目标的攻关运动，大攻质量关，号召职工学习武昌机器厂的经验，为“零”而战，把全厂废品率下降到零。在组织无废品日前，厂里领导反复研究了使废品率达到零的具体方法和步骤，并由党、政、工、团领导人员和工程技术人员组成促进团，下车间边检查、边解决问题。车间里也下达了指标要求，检查了工、卡、量具，检查了设备和半成品的储备。12月15日零点，一场夺“零”的激战展开了。由于马学礼精神在职工思想上生了根，所以人人爱护集体荣誉，全厂一条心，一股劲，一切为夺“零”而战。大家对一些容易出废品的同志，叮嘱又叮嘱。有些床子上是学徒工在操作，前后床子上的工人就主动关照，积极帮助。终于在15日这天，机械加工确保了无废品、无返工、无安全事故。这一创举，大破迷信，铸造车间在17日也实现了全日无废品。工厂党委又提出年内“零”到底，实现“四无”（无废品、无返工、无事故、无差错）迎接开门红，并把无废品日中创造的好的作法从制度上巩固下来，如健全交接班制度和班前班后会、废品分析会等。现在厂里又开展了“生产运动会”、“球赛”等各种形式的竞赛，巩固群众热情，力争保持无废品。
    在攻关键，为“零”而战中，职工们大闹技术革新和技术革命。四车间刘迪元小组制造土拉床，解决了车齿轮A级孔达不到质量要求的关键。工具车间实现了样板加工机械化。过去每周只做五块样板，还有30％到40％的废品，现在提高工效八十倍，消灭了废品。技术检查科创造了精密量具和检查仪，确保高速检验，并消灭差错。他们还大破陈规，实行锻件“红检”，及时发现质量问题，及时返工。
    在这一战斗中，企业的管理工作全面加强。科室工作全面大改革。技术人员敲锣打鼓，送技术下车间，做到大问题不过夜，小问题不过时。检验人员在机床边检查，做一个，检一个，使工人做活时心中有数。设备动力科的工作人员利用工人吃饭停车的时间抢修设备。有的人还深入协作单位的车间和小组，帮助解决协作件质量问题。
