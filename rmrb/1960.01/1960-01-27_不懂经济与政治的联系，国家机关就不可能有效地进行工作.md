Editor's Note: This is a speech by Zenon Kliszko, Chairman of the Polish United Workers' Party Parliamentary Group, at a plenary session of the parliament. In this speech, Comrade Kliszko emphasized the principle of politics taking precedence in the relationship between politics and economics, and pointed out that the view that "only direct, immediate material interests are the sole driving force for people's lives and work" is "the true color of bourgeois ideology." Comrade Kliszko's views are correct and deserve the attention of our readers, especially economic workers and economic researchers. We now publish the full text of Comrade Kliszko's speech.

Esteemed Parliament! In his report, Premier Cyrankiewicz spoke about the main issues and main indicators of the 1960 national economic plan and budget. They clearly show that our productivity will continue to grow steadily and that our economy will develop at the speed befitting a socialist country. We are moving forward on an upward path. We see achievements and successes, but also the difficulties that accompany us, and we must overcome these difficulties.

In the recent decade, even in the recent, more difficult year, our industrial production has still risen significantly according to plan, and our national income has also been growing steadily. Within the possibilities of our economy, people's incomes have increased, and wages, allowances, and pensions have all been raised. The supply to the people has improved, and the quantity, variety, and quality of market commodities have expanded and increased. Therefore, the living standards of the working people are gradually improving.

All this is undeniable. Almost everyone can experience it from their own personal example. Of course, there are exceptions, and not every family's situation matches the statistical average.

This fact is also beyond doubt: in the recent decade, we have been one of the countries with the highest population growth rates in the world. During this period, our population has increased by four million. From a fundamental point of view, this phenomenon is undoubtedly gratifying for the future of a nation. But today, it still creates certain consequences and difficulties in life, because a family that feeds one or two children is always easier than a family that feeds four or five children. The most serious difficulty in our economy is that the growth of agricultural production cannot keep up with the needs of the country. One of the main difficulties in the recent period has been the imbalance between the growth of consumption and residents' purchasing power and the growth of labor productivity. In the first half of 1959, real wages increased by more than 34% compared to the average level of 1955, but labor productivity only increased by 21% during the same period.

Probably no economy can increase the wage fund by 11%, increase purchasing power by 10%, and have the growth rate of net investment greater than the growth of national income as we did this year, without difficulty.

Does that mean that we think the wages in our national economy are too high? Of course not. But the level of labor productivity and the level of production growth are also not very high, so the national income available for distribution is not very large either. Without a substantial increase in production efficiency, there can be no stable and continuous growth in wages and living standards. This year's difficulties have painfully reminded us of such an important truth.

In the process of discussing the 1959 plan, our parliamentary group believed that the successful implementation of the Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) would require, on the one hand, a significant improvement in the people's living standards, and, on the other hand, a corresponding guarantee of the growth of productive forces. This is the basic condition for the comprehensive development of our economy.

The first task has been largely completed in 1956-1957. During that period, the growth of consumption exceeded the growth of national income. There were special reasons for this, but it caused enormous tension in the entire national economy. Therefore, in 1958, we tightly controlled wage adjustments, limiting them to the extent that production could satisfy purchasing power.

However, in the process of implementing the 1959 plan, there emerged tendencies and facts that could seriously threaten the market balance and the realization of the Five-Year Plan's tasks. We must quickly draw conclusions from this: if the principle that the growth of productive forces cannot be obtained at the cost of lowering people's living standards is correct, then the principle that consumption growth exceeding the economic possibilities of the time cannot be achieved by ignoring production development is also very correct. In either the first or second case, chaos will occur, hindering the steady development of the national economy, and thus threatening us with difficulties in raising the living standards of the working masses. The issue of the correct ratio between the growth of real wages and the growth of labor productivity, the issue of production, management, responsibility, strict economy, social discipline, and financial discipline – all these are the basic directions of our activities and our daily practical work. Only by following this path can we achieve the continuous growth of national income and the welfare of every worker. The Third Congress of our Party (March 1959) and the resolutions of all previous Central Committee plenary sessions have talked about these directions.

What are the obstacles on this road? I would like to briefly talk about some of these obstacles. I think the crux of the matter lies in the fact that some people, some social strata, underestimate the role of our country, underestimate the role of the socialist state in shaping the development of productive forces and in forming production relations and relationships between people.

With the development of People's Poland, a selfless and active attitude towards building socialism has formed and is forming among the basic masses of the people. Of course, the working class is leading the way. The edifice of People's Poland has risen and continues to rise from the labor and selflessness of the working class. Under the leadership of the working class, the peasants and intellectuals also directly and actively participate in the establishment of new economic, social, and cultural relations. Our youth also makes important and selfless contributions to our socialist construction. In the process of socialist construction, the level of awareness of the working people is improving.

However, this is not carried out without struggle and without conflict. Our class enemies have not withdrawn from the battlefield either. In the current situation, their main weapon is to attempt to emasculate the political and ideological content of socialist production and reproduction processes.

Therefore, it is necessary to talk about the issue of material incentives. We often encounter a vulgar and simplistic understanding of the role of material incentives, treating it as an absolute dogma, as the only criterion for people's activities. All this leads to the devaluation of the value of the working class and the laboring masses' faith and ideological relationship with political and economic issues. It is wrong to think that only direct, immediate material interests are the sole driving force for people's lives and work. This view of the role of material incentives is the true color of bourgeois ideology. Under our conditions, it can only spread pessimism and demoralize the moral values of the Polish working people. Some people often use mercantilist ideas to excuse the theft of social wealth, "know how to calculate," and use liberalism and tolerance to treat such phenomena, and portray the behavior of making money by any means as a principle of life. This attitude is essentially incompatible with our society, especially with our working class.

We are far from wanting to reduce the great significance of material incentives. When applied correctly, we consider it one of the main conditions for the development of the national economy. But in Poland, under the conditions of every socialist country, this material incentive must be given an appropriate place. It cannot be regarded as the only driving force for our economic development or as a panacea.

The expansion of the socialist economy is a conscious process carried out according to a plan that takes into account the requirements of various economic laws. Without this conscious action, socialist construction cannot proceed smoothly. Moving towards socialism must be a conscious and rational use of material incentives and the correct enlightenment of the consciousness of the working masses. Only the joint action of these two inseparable factors can guarantee the success of the action. Therefore, there must be no illusions. Even the most correct material incentives cannot, for a moment, make the conscious activities of the Party and the state and other non-economic measures unnecessary. It is often difficult to reconcile the individual interests of each member of the working class with the interests of the state. We are not always good at making it easy for people to understand the connection between general political issues and specific economic issues. We do not always master the irrefutable truth in an easy-to-understand way for the employees: that without the overall growth of production, the improvement of labor productivity, the reduction of costs, and the saving of materials, etc., any increase in wages is only an unstable and unsustainable achievement. In fact, we can cultivate such an attitude everywhere, because every region, every factory, and every institution has many examples showing that the respect for one's own and others' labor, the love for the profession, are deeply nurtured in the working class, and they show full preparation and selfless cooperation in improving labor organization, rectifying the economy, and tapping potential.

People are indignant more than once because their efforts in this regard are ignored and despised, and their rational suggestions are not implemented. Trade unions, workers' self-government representative conferences, worker committees, and especially political organizations, must represent the sense of justice of the masses, more broadly ideologically combat those egoistic and demoralizing tendencies of the working masses, which abuse the principle of material incentives with the aim of achieving personal interests at the expense of the interests of the state and others.

We are not against high wages. On the contrary, we are happy about it, as long as it is built on actual labor contributions. We are willing to do our best to enable employees to earn higher and higher wages while improving their labor productivity. The problem is that this wage should be reasonable, recognized as fair, and make people with the same level of skill earn roughly the same wages. The condition for this, of course, is to formulate labor quotas that are fair and have the same intensity for everyone, which is one of the most fundamental issues in our economy. This issue requires a thorough rectification and is also one of the most important tasks of the entire economic administrative department and the central state organs. In the work of the parliament in formulating the draft plan and budget for 1960, we should take the rectification of every sector of our economy as the general direction, and all parliamentary committees should resolutely fight to strengthen financial discipline. First of all, we should look at the intentions of investment, especially from the perspective of its effectiveness, its preparation, its current and future purposes. The draft investment plan for 1960 still includes investment projects that do not have the necessary and approved design and cost documents. This fact requires us to deeply analyze this draft investment plan.

The issue of strengthening national financial discipline does not only exist in investment. It also involves all other state expenditures, including administrative expenditures. There are some materials that can and should be very helpful to the work of the parliamentary committees. These materials are: the rich and interesting analyses of the Investment Bank, the materials of the Supreme Procuratorate, the materials of analysis research institutes or various investigations, and the materials of the interesting discussion process at the workers' self-government representative conferences, and the interesting and informative materials prepared by the highest technical organizations and the Polish Academy of Sciences for discussing the issue of labor productivity.

The work planned by the committees and their affiliated various groups and committees can and should increase the contribution of our deputies in formulating the appropriate proportional relationship in the plan and budget, that is, to most appropriately shape the economy and life of the new coming year.

One of the most difficult tasks to complete in 1960 is to complete the agricultural production growth plan. This is because, against the background of the overall feed difficulties that hinder the economic development in the plan, there are new difficulties related to this year's drought. We are currently strongly feeling its consequences, and its consequences will not be reduced in the coming year, especially during the lean season.

The government is taking important steps to mitigate the consequences of the drought. Comrade Cyrankiewicz has already talked about this in his speech.

It is very important to make the rural areas use these relief supplies in the most rational way. The fact that agricultural investment has increased significantly deserves special emphasis. This is a manifestation of the emphasis on developing agriculture as emphasized in the joint resolution of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party and the Central Committee of the United Peasants' Party.

The main directions of investment are agricultural mechanization and soil improvement, which are of fundamental significance for agricultural production.

Therefore, the most important task is to carry out long-term political organizational work, which can ensure the most effective use of these huge investments.

Agricultural groups should play a special role. They are the owners of agricultural machinery and equipment that are being invested in agriculture in such large quantities for the first time. In the process of agricultural groups preparing to take on this role, it is of great significance to discuss with them the basic issues related to the economics and organization of agricultural mechanization during the winter. The agricultural groups also face great tasks in breeding, especially seeds of grains and potatoes, as well as crop protection, soil improvement and protection of water conservancy facilities, and managing the land of the national land fund.

The Polish United Workers' Party Parliamentary Group sees in these measures the fundamental conditions for realizing the tasks of agricultural production. It also sees the possibility of balancing the gap caused by the fact that the level of agricultural production growth this year has not reached the plan, as well as accelerating the next few years. Therefore, members of our party and activists of the United Peasants' Party will actively help agricultural groups understand these main production tasks as much as possible, and help them prepare to realize these tasks. Let’s talk about the prospects for feed and solving the problem of feed shortage. I am referring to planting corn as green feed and storing feed. What the results will be will depend on the work of state-owned farms. In their plan for 1960, they plan to sow 80,000 hectares, of which about 60,000 hectares will be mainly for corn, more than double that of 1959. Planting corn as stored feed, especially on large areas of state-owned farms, requires full mechanical equipment.

In this regard, we have the guaranteed help of our Soviet friends. The Soviet Union will supply us with 150 sets of machinery next year, which can mechanize the entire corn cultivation process, and also supply us with 550 combine harvesters with equipment for making stored feed. Next year, we will start manufacturing our own combine harvesters for green feed and corn stored feed.

Next, I would like to briefly talk about the issue of strengthening the government's coordination functions and coordinating the activities of various interrelated departments and many competent authorities. From our own rich practice, we know how seriously narrow departmentalism exists in the central organs, especially in the People's Representative Council. They distort the political treatment of economic issues and create difficulties for correctly understanding national interests. Sometimes it is difficult to eliminate the rigid attitudes and limitations between departments even when working in the same building.

Therefore, we must strengthen the coordination links of our regime. It is also necessary to make the state organs work more perfectly, and more deeply understand the essence of the regime's activities and the connection between economics and politics.

The correct decision to carry out organizational reforms in the government agencies and the Planning Commission, as well as the appointment of new deputy premiers and new deputy chairmen of the Planning Commission, are also such an intention.

Esteemed Parliament! Life is a strict and wise teacher. The long-term practice of our country's socialist construction and the experience of fraternal socialist countries have irrefutably proved that without a correct understanding of the relationship between economics and politics with politics in command, there can be no effective activities of state organs in socialist countries. Our state organs should be fundamentally different from the state organs of capitalist countries. Any good economic worker, even one with good economic knowledge, must also be a political worker. He should be good at combining general political issues with specific economic tasks. Then we can eliminate those difficulties that even tease us when we implement the most correct tasks put forward by the Party and the government. Then we can also ensure the lasting connection between our economic cadres and the working class and the laboring masses. This will directly promote the more active work of worker committees, worker self-government representative conferences, and production conferences. But we must know that without the increasingly broad activities from below by the laboring masses, it is difficult to smoothly realize our further goals and difficult to continue to advance our socialist construction cause.

We have every reason to conclude that we will realize the economic tasks of 1960 in a favorable and improving international situation. It can be said that everything, whether in the sky or on the earth, indicates this. Not long ago, we personally witnessed the outstanding achievements of Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States. This visit practically promoted the cause of peaceful coexistence, improved the international atmosphere, and increased the prestige of socialism in the world. Both the Soviet Union's policies and its economic and scientific achievements (marked by the launch of three "lunar rockets" in a year) are conducive to easing the situation and to peace.

People's Poland, within the scope of the socialist camp's common efforts for peace, makes its own contribution to the cause of peace and the cause of peaceful competition between socialism and capitalism. We are also making contributions with our socialist construction and our correct foreign policy. We can point out with satisfaction that the connection between our country and the entire socialist camp is constantly strengthening, and Poland's role and prestige in the world are constantly increasing. Completing the economic and social tasks of 1960 before us has not only domestic significance but also international significance. Because every progress in socialist construction, developing national productivity, and saving is the basis for our contribution to the cause of peace and progress for all mankind.

    不懂经济与政治的联系，国家机关就不可能有效地进行工作
    编者按：这是波兰统一工人党议会党团主席泽·克利什科在议会全体会议上的发言。在这个发言中，克利什科同志着重地谈到了在政治与经济的关系中应当以政治为主的原则，指出了那种“认为只有直接的、眼前的物质利益才是人们生活和工作的唯一动力”的观点是“资产阶级思想的本色”。克利什科同志的这些观点是正确的，值得引起我国读者特别是经济工作者和经济学研究者的注意。现在将克利什科同志的发言全文译载于下。
    崇高的议会！西伦凯维兹总理在自己的报告中谈到了1960年国民经济计划和预算的主要问题和主要指标。它们清楚地说明我们的生产力将继续不断地增长，我们的经济将以社会主义国家所应有的速度发展。我们在沿着向上的道路前进着，我们看到成就和成绩，但是，同时也看到伴随着我们的困难，并且必须克服这些困难。
    在最近的十年期间，甚至在最近的比较困难的一年中，我们的工业生产仍是按照计划显著地上升着，我们的国民收入也是一直增长的。在我们经济的可能范围内，人民的收入增长了，工资、津贴金、养老费都提高了。改善了对人民的供应，扩大和增多了市场商品的数量、品种和质量。因此劳动人民的生活水平在逐步地提高着。
    这一切是无可争辩的。几乎每一个人都可以从自己个人的例子中体会到了。当然也有例外，并不是每个家庭的情况都符合统计的平均指数的。
    这个事实也是无可怀疑的，即在最近的十年中我们是世界上人口增长率最高的国家之一。在这期间，我们的人口增加了四百万，从根本的观点看来，这种现象对于一个民族的未来，无疑是可喜的。但是在今天，它还是造成了一定的后果和生活困难。因为养活一、两个孩子的家总比养活四、五个孩子的家容易。我们经济的最严重的困难是农业生产的增长赶不上国家的需要，最近期间主要困难之一，是消费和居民购买力的增长同劳动生产率增长之间的不平衡。1959年上半年的实际工资比1955年的中等水平增长了34％以上，但是，同时期劳动生产率只提高了21％。
    恐怕没有这样的经济，它能没有困难地使工资基金增加11％，购买力增加10％，而净投资的增长速度像我们在本年度一样大于国民收入的增长。
    那是否说，我们认为我们国民经济中的工资太高了？当然不是。但是劳动生产率水平、生产增长水平也不是很高，因此，随之而来的就是用于分配的国民收入也不太多。生产效率不大大提高，就谈不到工资和生活水平稳步的不断的增长，今年的困难沉痛地向我们提醒了这样一个重要的真理。
    在讨论1959年计划的过程中，我们的议会党团认为：五年计划（1956—1960年）的顺利实现将要求一方面大大改善人民生活水平，另一方面要保证生产力相应的增长，这是我们经济全面发展的基本条件。
    第一个任务，在很大的程度上已经在1956—1957年中完成了。在那段时期里，消费的增长超过了国民收入的增长。在这方面曾经有过特殊的理由，但却因此在整个国民经济中产生了巨大的紧张。因此，在1958年，我们紧紧地掌握了工资调整，把它限于生产满足购买力的范围之内。
    但是，在1959年的计划执行过程中，又出现了能够严重威胁市场平衡和五年计划任务的实现的倾向和事实。必须迅速从这里得出结论，如果生产力的增长不能以降低人民生活水平的代价来获取的原则是正确的，那么，不能以忽视生产发展来取得超过当时的经济可能性的消费增长的原则，也是非常正确的。不论在第一或第二种情况下，都会发生混乱，会阻碍国民经济的稳固发展，并因之使提高劳动群众的生活水平的困难，都威胁我们。实际工资的增长和劳动生产率的增长之间的正确比例问题，生产、管理问题、责任问题、严格的节约制度、社会纪律和财政纪律问题——这一切都是我们的活动和我们日常切实的工作的基本方向，只有走这条道路才能取得国民收入和每个劳动者的福利的不断增长。我们党的第三次代表大会（1959年3月），历次中央全会的决议，都谈到了这些方向。
    在这道路上有什么障碍呢？我想简短地谈一下其中的某些障碍。我认为实质问题在于某些方面的人、某些社会阶层低估我们国家的作用，低估社会主义国家在形成生产力发展和形成生产关系、人和人之间的关系方面的作用。
    随着人民波兰的发展，在人民的基本群众中形成了和形成着为建设社会主义而忘我的积极态度。当然，首先是工人阶级在领先。人民波兰的大厦正是从工人阶级的劳动和忘我精神中升起来和继续上升着的，农民和知识分子在工人阶级的领导下也直接地和积极地参加新的经济、社会和文化关系的建立，我们的青年在我们的社会主义建设中也作着重要的忘我的贡献。在社会主义建设过程中劳动人民的觉悟水平在提高。
    但是，这并不是毫无斗争和毫无冲突地进行的，我们的阶级敌人也并没有退出战场，在目前的情况下，他们的主要武器是企图阉割社会主义生产和再生产过程的政治思想内容。
    因此有必要谈一谈物质鼓励问题。我们常常碰到有人把物质鼓励作用庸俗化和简单化的理解，把它当作绝对的教条，当作人们活动的唯一准绳。这一切导致贬低工人阶级、劳动群众对政治、经济问题的信仰和思想关系的价值。认为只有直接的、眼前的物质利益才是人们生活和工作的唯一动力是错误的。对物质鼓励的作用的这种观点是资产阶级思想的本色，在我们的条件下，它只能在波兰劳动人民的道德观念中散布悲观情绪和使人堕落。有人常常用重商主义思想来为盗窃社会财富、“会打算盘”、以及用自由主义和宽容态度对待这种现象的人来开脱，并把不择手段的赚钱行为说成是生活原则。这种态度本质上是同我们的社会，首先是同我们工人阶级格格不入的。
    我们远非要降低物质鼓励的巨大意义。在正确应用它时，我们认为它是国民经济发展的主要条件之一。但是在波兰，在每个社会主义国家的条件下，必须给予这种物质鼓励以适当的地位。不能把它看作我国经济发展的唯一动力或者是能治百病的万灵药。
    社会主义经济的扩大，是按照考虑到各种经济规律的要求的计划而进行的自觉过程。没有这种自觉的行动，社会主义建设就不能顺利地前进。向社会主义前进必须是自觉的、合理的运用物质鼓励和正确地启发劳动群众的觉悟。只有这两个不可分割的因素共同作用，才能保证行动的成功。因此决不能产生错觉。甚至最正确的物质鼓励，也一刻不能把党和国家的有意识的活动及其他非经济性的措施变成不必要的东西。使工人阶级每个成员的个人利益和国家利益相一致，常常是困难的。我们并不是时时善于使人容易了解把总的政治问题同具体的经济问题联系起来。我们并不是总会以易于了解的方法使职工们掌握这一颠扑不破的真理：即如果没有生产的总的增长、劳动生产率的提高、成本的降低和物质的节约等等，工资的任何提高只不过是不稳固的、不持久的成就。其实，这样一种态度我们到处都可以培养出来，因为每一个地区，每一个工厂，每一个机关有很多例子说明，在工人阶级中深深地孕育着对自己和别人的劳动的尊重，对专业的热爱，他们在改善劳动组织、整顿经济和发掘潜力方面表现有充分的准备和忘我的协作精神。
    由于他们在这方面的努力受到忽视和轻视，他们的合理建议得不到实现，人们不只一次地感到愤慨。工会、工人自治代表会议、工人委员会、特别是政治组织，必须代表群众的正义感，更广泛地从思想上来打击那些利己主义的和使劳动群众堕落的倾向，这种倾向以损害国家与他人的利益来取得个人利益，并以此为目的滥用物质鼓励原则。
    我们并不反对高工资，相反，我们为此而高兴，只要这是建筑在实际的劳动贡献上。我们愿尽一些力量使职工在提高自己的劳动生产率的同时而获得越来越高的工资。问题在于这种工资应当是合理的、公认为公正的，使熟练程度相同的人们取得相差不多的工资。其条件当然是公正地制定对所有人都具相同强度的劳动定额，这是我们经济中最根本的问题之一。这个问题要求彻底的整顿，同时也是整个经济行政部门和国家中央机关的最重要的任务之一。在议会制定1960年的计划和预算草案的工作中，我们应该以整顿我们经济的每个部门为总方针，所有的议会委员会应该为加强财政纪律而坚决斗争。首先应该看看投资的意图，特别是从它的效果、它的准备、它的目前和将来的目的等方面来看。1960年的投资计划草案中，仍然还列有那些不具备必要的和业经批准了的设计和造价文件的投资项目。这一事实，要求我们深入分析这个投资计划草案。
    加强国家财政纪律问题不只存在于投资方面。它同样涉及到国家所有的其他开支，其中包括行政开支。有一些材料能够和应该对议会委员会的工作有很大帮助，这些材料是：投资银行丰富而有趣的分析、最高检察院的材料和分析研究所或调查机关各方面的调查研究材料，以及工人自治代表会议上有趣的讨论过程的材料、最高技术组织和波兰科学院为讨论关于劳动生产率问题的会议所准备的有趣的和有教益的材料。
    这样为委员会及其附属的各种小组和委员会所筹划出来的工作，能够而且应该加大我们的议员在制订计划和预算中的适当比例关系时所作的贡献，即最恰当地形成新的即将来临的一年的经济和生活。
    1960年最难完成的任务之一是完成农业生产增长计划。这是由于在妨碍计划中的经济发展的总的饲料困难的背景上，又出现了新的与今年的旱灾有关的困难。目前我们已强烈地感到它的后果，而且它的后果在明年也毫不会减轻，特别是在青黄不接的时候。
    政府正在采取重要的步骤来减轻旱灾的后果。关于这一点，西伦凯维兹同志在自己的讲话中已经谈过了。
    使农村最合理地使用这些救济物资，是非常重要的问题。农业投资显著增长的事实值得特别强调。这是贯彻统一工人党中央和统一农民党中央的联合决议中所强调的发展农业问题的表现。
    投资的主要方向是农业机械化和土壤改良，这对农业生产具有根本的意义。
    因此最重要的任务是进行长期的政治组织工作，它能保证最有效地使用这些巨大的投资。
    农业小组要起特别的作用，它们是第一次被这样大量地投入农业的农业机械设备的主人。在农业小组准备担任这个角色的工作中，在冬季同它们一起讨论有关农业机械化的经济和组织方面的基本问题有很大意义。在农业小组面前还摆着育种方面的很大任务，特别是谷物和马铃薯的种子以及作物保护、土壤改良和保护水利设备，以及经营国家土地基金的土地等巨大任务。
    波兰统一工人党议会党团在这些措施中看到实现农业生产任务的根本条件，也看到平衡今年农业生产增长水平未达到计划所造成的差额，以及加速今后几年的可能性。因此我们党的成员和统一农民党的活动家们，将尽可能积极地帮助农业小组了解这些主要生产任务，并帮助他们准备实现这些任务。再谈一谈饲料的前景和解决饲料不足问题。我是指种植玉米作为青饲料和贮藏饲料。结果怎样，将要取决于国营农场的工作。在它们的计划中，在1960年，计划播种八万公顷，其中以玉米为主要收成的约六万公顷，这比1959年增加两倍多。种植玉米作为贮藏饲料，特别是在国营农场的大面积土地上要求充分的机械装备。
    在这方面我们有着苏联朋友的有保障的帮助。苏联明年供应我们一百五十套机械，它们可以使玉米的全部耕作过程机械化，还供应我们五百五十台联合收割机并带有做贮藏饲料的设备。明年我们将着手自己制造青饲料和玉米贮藏饲料的联合收割机。
    下面我想简短地谈一谈加强政府的协作机能，协调各个互相关联的部门和许多主管部门的活动问题。从我们自己丰富的实践中，我们知道：在中央机关中，特别是在人民代表会议中，是如何严重地存在着狭隘的本位主义，他们曲解从政治上来对待经济问题，并为正确地理解全国利益造成困难。有时甚至在一个屋子办公也难于消除各部门之间的僵硬态度和局限性。
    由此必须加强我们政权的协作环节。同样必须使国家机关更完善地工作，更深地理解政权活动的实质问题，经济同政治的联系问题。
    关于在政府机构和计划委员会中进行组织改革的正确决定，以及任命新的副总理和新的计委副主席也都是这样一个意图。
    崇高的议会！生活是严厉和明智的教师。我国社会主义建设的多年实践和兄弟的社会主义国家的经验无可辩驳地证明了，没有正确地理解以政治为主的经济和政治之间的联系，就谈不到社会主义国家中的国家机关的有效的活动，而我们的国家机关应该根本不同于资本主义国家的国家机关。任何一个即使是具有很好的经济知识的好经济工作者，也必须同时是政治工作者。他应善于把总的政治问题同具体的经济任务结合起来。那时我们才能消除那些甚至在我们实现党和政府所提出的最正确的任务时也作弄着我们的困难。那时我们也才能保证我们的经济干部与工人阶级同劳动群众的持久的联系。这将直接地促进工人委员会、工人自治代表会议和生产会议更积极地工作。但是要知道，没有劳动群众来自下面的越来越广泛的活动，很难顺利地实现我们进一步的目标，很难继续推进我们的社会主义建设事业。
    我们有一切根据断定，我们将会在有利的和改善着的国际形势中实现1960年的经济任务。可以这样说，无论是天上还是地上的一切标志都说明这一点。不久前我们曾亲眼看到赫鲁晓夫同志访美所取得的卓越成就，这次访问实际地推进了和平共处事业、改善了国际气氛和提高了社会主义在世界上的威信。无论是苏联的政策还是它的经济成就和科学成就（它的标记就是一年中放出三个“月球火箭”）都有利于局势缓和与和平。
    人民波兰在社会主义阵营共同的争取和平的范围中，对和平事业以及社会主义同资本主义和平竞赛的事业，作出自己的贡献。我们也正以我们的社会主义建设和我们的正确的外交政策作出贡献。我们可以满意地指出，我们国家与整个社会主义阵营的联系在不断地增强着，波兰在世界上的作用和威信在不断地增长。完成摆在我们面前的1960年的经济和社会的任务，不仅具有国内意义，而且也具有国际意义。因为在社会主义建设、发展国家生产力和节约方面的每一个进步，都是我们对全人类的和平和进步事业作出贡献的基础。
