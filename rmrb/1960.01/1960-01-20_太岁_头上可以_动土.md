"Moving Earth" on the Head of "Tai Sui"

During the process of Wu Delun, Wang Weidao and other comrades innovating the control panel, some people believed that such world-advanced technology was already a done deal, and trying to reform it was simply "moving earth on the head of Tai Sui."

However, Wu Delun and other comrades were not intimidated by the so-called world-advanced technology. They dared to "move earth" on the head of "Tai Sui." They not only moved a spade or two, but moved a lot, and in the end, they completely changed the old face of this "Tai Sui," creating a new type of control panel. This incident shows that as long as we dare to think and dare to act, we can break into any forbidden zone of science and technology.

The Party often teaches us: we must continuously revolutionize and liberate our minds. In enterprises with a poor technical foundation, we must vigorously carry out technical innovation to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization; in modern enterprises, we must also vigorously carry out technical innovation to achieve higher standards of innovation goals. However, some comrades’ minds are always unable to be completely liberated, and they are always afraid to "offend" the so-called most advanced level. In the depths of these comrades' souls, the "Jia Gui" mentality is still lurking. We must thoroughly eliminate this thinking so that the technical innovation movement can move forward in greater strides.

Our grand ambition is to change the "poor and blank" face of our motherland in the 1960s. In order to achieve this great goal, in the technological revolution, we must have the spirit of Wu Delun and other comrades: better is not good enough, newer is not new enough, and never stop moving forward.

### “太岁”头上可以“动土”

    “太岁”头上可以“动土”
    在吴德伦、王伟道等同志革新操纵箱的过程中，曾有一些人认为：像这样的世界先进技术，已成定局，再想改革，简直是“太岁头上动土”。
    然而，吴德伦等同志没有被所谓世界先进技术所吓住，竟然在“太岁”头上动了土，不但动了一锹两锹，而且大动特动，到最后，简直彻底改变了这位“太岁”的旧面貌，创造出了一种新型的操纵箱。这件事情说明，只要敢想敢干，任何科学技术的禁地，我们都是可以闯进去的。
    党经常教导我们：要不断革命，解放思想。在技术基础差的企业里，固然要大搞技术革新，实现机械化半机械化；而在现代化的企业里，同样要大搞技术革新，实现更高标准的革新目标。但是，有些同志的思想总是不能彻底解放，总是不敢去“冒犯”所谓最先进的水平。在这些同志的灵魂深处，“贾桂”思想仍然在潜伏着。我们必须彻底清除这种思想，技术革新运动才能更好地大踏步地前进。
    我们的宏图大志是在六十年代里改变我们祖国“一穷二白”的面貌。为了达到这个伟大目标，在技术革命中，我们就要有吴德伦等同志这样的气概：好了还要更好，新了还要更新，永远不停止前进。
