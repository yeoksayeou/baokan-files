Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th: Disregarding the firm opposition of peace-loving people in Japan and around the world, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and U.S. Secretary of State Herter signed an aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in Washington on the 19th, aimed at China, the Soviet Union, and all the people of Asia, thereby posing a serious threat to peace in the Far East.

This aggressive military alliance treaty, called the U.S.-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security," consists of a preamble and ten articles. The reactionary forces of the United States and Japan have painstakingly inserted beautiful words such as "peace," "security," "friendship," and "democracy" into the articles, but they cannot conceal the treaty's aggressive nature, which was drafted in accordance with the notorious "Vandenberg Resolution."

Article 3 of the treaty stipulates: "The Parties, individually and in cooperation with each other, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid will maintain and develop, subject to their constitutional provisions, their capacities to resist armed attack." As for how Japan will "develop" its ability to "resist" so-called "armed attack," according to a recent report in the American "National Guardian" weekly, the revised U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" requires Japan to arm itself with nuclear weapons in order to wage effective modern warfare. Kishi Nobusuke has also repeatedly declared that Japan's possession of nuclear weapons "does not violate the Constitution."

As for "subject to their constitutional provisions," that is ridiculous, because Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution clearly stipulates: Japan "will not maintain land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, and will not recognize the right of the state to belligerency."

Articles 4 and 5 of the new treaty then stipulate that Japan has an obligation to protect U.S. forces stationed in Japan and will send troops abroad to serve as accomplices in U.S. aggression. Article 5 states: "Each Party recognizes that an armed attack against either Party in the territories under the administration of Japan would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional provisions and processes." Article 4 stipulates: "The Parties will consult together from time to time regarding the implementation of this Treaty and, at the request of either Party, whenever the security of Japan or international peace and security in the Far East is threatened." Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama made it clear on this point, saying: "If U.S. forces stationed in Japan are attacked, Japan must also retaliate." He also said: "When Japan is attacked, it is possible to pursue the enemy." According to Fujiyama's explanation, the scope of "Far East" mentioned in the new treaty is "the areas surrounding Japan, such as north of the Philippines, the coast of China, and the (Soviet) Maritime Territory." He also said: U.S. troops can be dispatched to "the interior of China or the Soviet Union" and "can be dispatched to areas outside the Far East." Kishi Nobusuke said even more bluntly that Japanese troops can also be sent abroad to "attack enemy bases."

Article 6 of the treaty stipulates: "For the purpose of contributing to the security of Japan and the maintenance of international peace and security in the Far East, United States of America is granted the use by its land, air and naval forces of facilities and areas in Japan." In order to conceal the U.S. plot to use this clause to turn Japan into a nuclear war base for aggression in the Far East and to dispel public concerns in Japan, the new treaty specifically added an exchange of notes stipulating that "major changes" in the "deployment and equipment" of U.S. forces stationed in Japan or the use of Japanese bases for war not for the purpose of "defending" Japan will be "consulted in advance" with the Japanese government. However, according to Asahi Broadcasting Corporation on January 16, the United States intends to clearly stipulate that "prior consultation" does not require obtaining Japan's consent. Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama also said that the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" does not specifically prohibit U.S. forces stationed in Japan from possessing nuclear weapons.

The new treaty has a protocol on the issue of Okinawa Island. It stipulates that if Okinawa Island is subjected to armed attack or threatened, Japan and the United States should immediately consult with each other in accordance with Article 4 of the treaty, and the United States is prepared to take necessary measures to "defend" the island. The new treaty and the protocol align the effective scope of the U.S.-Japan military alliance with the "common defense area" of the U.S.-Chiang, U.S.-Rhee, and U.S.-Philippines treaties, which were also formulated in accordance with the "Vandenberg Resolution." This, in fact, forms the Northeast Asian military alliance that the United States has planned for a long time.

The new treaty also inherited, in the form of an "exchange of documents," the notes exchanged by former Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida and former U.S. Secretary of State Acheson on September 8, 1951, regarding Japan's support for the U.S. military's aggression against Korea under the banner of the "United Nations Forces." This means that Japan will continue to be an accomplice in the U.S. aggression war under the guise of the "United Nations Forces" in the future.

In addition, Article 2 of the new treaty also stipulates "promoting economic cooperation between the two countries." The so-called U.S.-Japan "economic cooperation" means that Japan will undertake the above-mentioned military obligations and allow the United States to further control the Japanese economy in exchange for U.S. support for Japan's expansion into Southeast Asia.

According to Article 6 of the new treaty, Japan and the United States also signed an "Agreement Regarding Facilities and Areas and the Status of United States Armed Forces in Japan." This agreement was revised based on the original U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement," which humiliated Japan and harmed its sovereignty. As in the past, the new agreement continues to stipulate that U.S. forces stationed in Japan enjoy extraterritoriality. The agreement, which consists of twenty-eight articles, also details the various privileges enjoyed by the U.S. military in Japan, including the arbitrary possession, expansion, and construction of new bases.

The new U.S.-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" will take effect from the time the instruments of ratification are exchanged between the two parties in Tokyo and will be valid for at least eleven years. Because Article 10 of the treaty stipulates that it will only expire one year after either party notifies of its abrogation ten years after the treaty takes effect.

### “安全”“合作”是名　侵略扩张是实  新的日美“安全条约”条条充满火药味

    “安全”“合作”是名　侵略扩张是实
    新的日美“安全条约”条条充满火药味
    据新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：不顾日本和全世界爱好和平人民的坚决反对，日本首相岸信介同美国国务卿赫脱19日在华盛顿签订了以中国、苏联和全亚洲人民为敌的侵略性日美军事同盟条约，从而对远东和平带来严重的威胁。
    这个被叫做日美“共同合作和安全条约”的侵略性的军事同盟条约由序言和十项条款组成。美日反动派煞费苦心地在条文中装上的“和平”、“安全”、“友好”、“民主”等漂亮词句，丝毫也掩盖不了这个遵照臭名远扬的“范登堡决议”拟订的条约的侵略本质。
    条约第三条规定：“缔约国将单独地和互相合作，通过不断的有效的自助和互助，以遵循各自宪法的规定为条件来维持和发展各自抵御武装进攻的能力。”至于日本如何“发展”它“抵御”所谓“武装进攻的能力”，据美国“国民前卫”周刊最近报道，修改后的日美“安全条约”要求日本以核武器装备起来，以便进行有效的现代化战争。岸信介也早已多次宣布日本拥有核武器“并不违反宪法”。
    至于说“遵循宪法的规定”，那就滑稽了，因为日本宪法第九条明文规定：日本“不得保有陆海空军及其他作战力量，不承认国家之交战权”。
    新条约的第四条和第五条接着规定，日本有义务保护驻日美军，并将派兵出国，充当美国的侵略帮凶。条约第五条写道：“缔约国的每一方都认识到在日本管理下的领土上对于任何一方发动的武装进攻都会危及本国的和平和安全，并且宣布它将按照自己的宪法规定和程序采取行动以应付共同的危险。”第四条规定：“缔约国将随时就本条约的执行情况进行协商，并将在日本的安全或远东的国际和平和安全受到威胁时，应任何一方的请求进行协商。”关于这一点日本外务相藤山爱一郎说得明白，他说：“如果驻日美军遭到攻击，日本也要还击。”他还说：“日本遭到进攻时，有可能追赶敌人。”根据藤山解释，新条约所说的“远东”的范围是“以菲律宾以北、中国的沿岸、（苏联）滨海边区等日本周围地区。”他还说：美军可以出动到“中国的内地或苏联”、“可以出动到远东以外地区”。岸信介说得更露骨，他说，日本军队也可以派到国外去“进攻敌人的基地”。
    条约第六条规定：“为了对日本的安全和维持远东的国际和平和安全作出贡献，美利坚合众国的陆军、空军和海军被允许使用在日本的设施和地区。”为了掩盖美国利用这一条款把日本变成在远东进行侵略的核战争基地的阴谋，以解除日本公众的疑虑，新条约特意增加了一个换文，规定驻日美军的“部署和装备作重要改变”或者不是为了“保卫”日本而使用日本基地进行战争时，要同日本政府“事先协商”。但是，据朝日广播公司1月16日透露，美国打算明确规定“事先协商”并不是需要取得日本的同意。日本外务相藤山也曾经说，新的日美“安全条约”并不特别禁止驻日美军拥有核武器。
    新条约附有一个关于冲绳岛问题的议事录。它规定，如果冲绳岛遭到武装攻击或者受到威胁时，日美双方要立即根据条约第四条互相协商，美国并且准备采取必要的措施来“保卫”这个岛屿。新条约和议事录使日美军事同盟的有效范围和同样根据“范登堡决议”制订的美蒋、美李、美菲条约的“共同防御地区”相吻合，这就在事实上形成了美国策划已久的东北亚军事同盟。
    新条约还以“交换文件”方式把日本前首相吉田茂和美国前国务卿艾奇逊在1951年9月8日签订“安全条约”时互换的关于日本支持打着“联合国军”旗号的侵朝美军的照会继承下来。这就是说，日本今后将继续作美国盗用“联合国军”旗号进行侵略战争的帮凶。
    此外，新条约在第二条还作出了“促进两国经济合作”的规定。所谓日美“经济合作”，就是日本以承担上述军事义务和允许美国进一步控制日本经济为条件来换取美国对日本向东南亚扩张的支持。
    根据新条约第六条，日美双方还签订了“关于设施、地方和合众国（即美国）驻在日本国的军队的地位的协定”。这个协定是根据原来的使日本丧权辱国的日美“行政协定”修改而成的。和过去一样，新协定继续规定驻日美军享有治外法权。这个由二十八条组成的协定并且详细规定了美军在日本享有的各种特权，其中包括任意保有、扩建和新建基地等。
    新的日美“共同合作和安全条约”将从双方在东京交换批准书时起生效，有效期限实际上最少十一年，因为条约第十条规定，只有在条约生效十年以后经过一方通知废除以后一年才失效。
