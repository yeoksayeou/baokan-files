    Opening up New Sources of Building Materials, Save More Valuable Building Materials
    Metallurgical Infrastructure System Promotes Ten Major New Technologies
    (Our dispatch) A technological innovation and revolution movement, with the promotion of ten major new technologies as its main content, is vigorously developing in the metallurgical industry's basic construction system. The promotion of these ten new technologies has greatly broken through the limitations in the use of materials in metallurgical industrial construction, opened up new sources of building materials, and created favorable conditions for saving valuable building materials.
    These ten new technologies are: prestressed concrete pipes, prestressed structures, wet-ground slag concrete, heat-resistant concrete, waterproof concrete, fine sand concrete, pressure grouting concrete construction method, brick arch crane beams, friction welding method, and cable dry sealing ends.
    In the past, steel structures and steel pipes were commonly used in metallurgical plant construction. Due to the preliminary achievements of prestressed structures and prestressed pipes in metallurgical construction, the appearance of metallurgical plant building structures is undergoing great changes. Most of the new factories built since the Great Leap Forward are reinforced concrete structures. Now, the steel used to build one steel plant can be used to build one and a half, two, or even three steel plants. This has created extremely favorable conditions for the continued leap forward in metallurgical industrial construction. For example, the 50,000-square-meter factory building in the machine repair area of Baotou Iron and Steel Company changed from the original design of all steel structures to basically all reinforced concrete structures, saving the country 6,000 tons of steel and more than 3 million yuan in investment. Wuhan Iron and Steel recently completed a reinforced concrete structure sintering plant, saving 2,400 tons of steel. As for prestressed concrete pipes replacing steel pipes, the savings in steel are even more considerable. Baotou Iron and Steel laid more than 7 kilometers of pressure water pipes, saving 2,400 tons of steel.
    Concrete, which requires the largest amount and is the most widely used in engineering, has always been made of cement, sand, and gravel. After the promotion of wet-ground slag concrete, more than half of the cement can be saved, and even all the cement can be saved. This new type of concrete can be made without any sand at all, and heavy slag can be used to replace gravel. Many metallurgical enterprises are now building wet-ground slag concrete plants. The construction units of Baotou Iron and Steel Company have launched a mass movement to vigorously develop wet-ground slag concrete, and plan to promote 130,000 cubic meters this year. For more than a year, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has broken through the old tradition of having to use coarse and medium sand to prepare concrete, and has used local fine sand to prepare more than 100,000 cubic meters of fine sand concrete, which not only saved the transportation capacity for transporting coarse sand from other places, but also saved more than 3 million yuan in funds. They used fine sand concrete to build a steel plant with an annual output of 600,000 tons, which has already been put into production.
    In the past, waterproof projects for underground structures in metallurgical plants have always used asphalt linen or steel plates as waterproof layers, which were troublesome to construct, expensive, and difficult to guarantee quality. The metallurgical construction system has successfully promoted more than 80,000 cubic meters of waterproof concrete, basically replacing the asphalt linen waterproof layer and the steel plate waterproof layer, which is simple to construct, reliable in quality, and low in cost.
    The pressure grouting concrete construction method is a revolution in concrete construction technology. In the past year or so, the metallurgical construction system has promoted more than 30,000 cubic meters, which has been warmly welcomed by the majority of workers, because this construction method has relieved the heavy physical labor of concrete construction and greatly improved work efficiency.
    Replacing refractory bricks with heat-resistant concrete can save a lot of refractory bricks. The use of friction welding to solve the technical problem of welding different metals is an international cutting-edge technology, which can save a lot of valuable metals. Cable dry sealing ends can not only save a lot of metal, but also have low cost, good quality, and do not take up space. The promotion of these new technologies has greatly promoted high-speed and high-quality construction.
    At present, the metallurgical basic construction departments are organizing forces, building factories, and adding equipment to prepare for a larger-scale promotion of these ten new technologies. (Attached picture)

    开辟新建筑材料来源　多节省贵重建筑材料
    冶金基建系统推广十大新技术
    本报讯　以推广十项重大新技术为主要内容的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在冶金工业基本建设系统蓬勃开展。这十大新技术的推广，大大突破了冶金工业建设中在使用材料方面的局限性，开辟了新的建筑材料来源，并为节省贵重建筑材料创造了有利条件。
    这十项新技术是：预应力混凝土管、预应力结构、湿碾矿渣混凝土、耐热混凝土、防水混凝土、细砂混凝土、压力灌浆混凝土施工法、砖拱吊车梁、摩擦焊接法、电缆干封端。
    在冶金工厂建筑中，过去都习惯于使用钢结构、钢铁管。由于预应力结构及预应力管在冶金建设中已获初步成果，冶金工厂建筑结构的面貌正在大大改观。大跃进以来新建的工厂绝大部分是钢筋混凝土结构。现在用原来建设一个钢铁厂的钢材可以建设一个半、二个甚至三三钢铁厂。这为冶金工业建设继续跃进创造了极为有利的条件。如包头钢铁公司的机修区五万平方米厂房，由原设计的全部钢结构改为基本全部钢筋混凝土结构，为国家节省钢材达六千吨，节省投资三百多万元。武钢最近建成了钢筋混凝土结构的烧结厂，节约钢材二千四百吨。至于预应力混凝土管代替钢铁管，节约钢铁更是可观。包钢铺设了七公里多的压力水管，就节约钢材二千四百吨。
    工程上需要量最大、使用最普遍的混凝土，向来都是以水泥、砂子和石子来配制的。推广湿碾矿渣混凝土以后，可以节约一半以上的水泥，甚至可以全部不用水泥。这种新型混凝土根本不用砂子就可以制成，进一步还可以用重矿渣代替石子。现在许多冶金企业都在建设湿碾矿渣混凝土厂。包钢各施工单位开展了大搞湿碾矿渣混凝土的群众运动，今年准备推广十三万立方米。重庆钢铁公司一年多来突破一定要用粗、中砂配制混凝土的旧传统，利用当地有的细砂配制了十几万立方米细砂混凝土，不仅节约了到外地运粗砂的运输力量，而且节约资金三百多万元。他们用细砂混凝土建成了年产六十万吨的钢厂，已经投入生产。
    冶金工厂中地下结构的防水工程过去一向都用沥青麻布或钢板做防水层，施工麻烦，造价高昂，而且不易保证质量。冶金建设系统已经成功地推广了八万多立方米防水混凝土，基本代替了沥青麻布防水层及钢板防水层，施工简便，质量可靠，造价也低。
    压浆混凝土施工法是混凝土施工工艺上的革命。一年多来，冶金建设系统推广了三万多立米，受到广大工人的热烈欢迎，因为这种施工法解除了混凝土施工的笨重体力劳动，大大提高了工效。
    以耐热混凝土代替耐火砖可以节约大量耐火砖。采用摩擦焊接法解决不同金属的焊接技术问题，是国际尖端技术，可以节约大量贵重金属。电缆干封端不仅可以节约大量金属，而且成本低，质量好，不占地方。这些新技术的推广都对高速优质施工起了很大的促进作用。
    目前，冶金基本建设部门正在组织力量，纷纷建厂，添置设备，准备更大规模地推广这十大新技术。（附图片）
