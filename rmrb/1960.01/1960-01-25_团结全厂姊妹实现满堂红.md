    Unite All Sisters in the Factory to Achieve Overall Success
    Jing Zilin, National Advanced Producer, Female Worker of Jiangxi Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory
    After reading the communique on the development of the national economy in 1959, we were extremely happy. Our factory also comprehensively completed the national plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target in 1959, with the total output value increasing by about 25% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.
    In the past year, I did some work and achieved certain results, and I had the honor of attending the National Congress of Heroes. This is the result of the Party's education and the help of comrades. If it weren't for the Party, how could I, a little servant girl who used to be a beast of burden for wealthy families in the old society, be where I am today! I must always listen to the Party, and I will go wherever the Party points. I want to work with sisters all over the country to contribute all my strength to achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.
    This year, our factory's production tasks have been greatly increased compared to last year. I guarantee to the Party that I will unite all the sisters in the factory, work hard and cleverly, and achieve monthly success and overall success.

    团结全厂姊妹实现满堂红
    全国先进生产者、江西棉纺织印染厂女工　经自麟
    看了1959年国民经济发展情况的公报，我们高兴极了。我们厂1959年也全面提前超额完成了国家计划，总产值比大跃进的1958年又增长了25％左右。
    在过去的一年中，我做了一些工作，取得了一定的成绩，光荣地出席了全国群英会。这是党的教育和同志们的帮助的结果。要不是党，我这个在旧社会替豪富人家做牛马的小丫头，那能有今天呢！我一定要永远听党的话，党指向哪里，我就奔往哪里。我要和全国姐妹们一道，为实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进贡献自己的全部力量。
    今年我们厂里的生产任务比去年又有很大提高。我向党保证，一定要团结全厂姊妹们，苦干巧干，做到月月红、满堂红。
