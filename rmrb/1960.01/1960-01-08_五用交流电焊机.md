    Five-Purpose AC Welding Machine
    Bai Yucai, a Communist Party member and welder at the Guizhou Automobile Manufacturing Plant, recently developed a five-purpose AC welding machine.
    In addition to the welding and cutting capabilities of a general welding machine, this welding machine can also perform spot welding, drilling, and welding of various sizes of cutting tools. Using this welding machine to weld and cut automotive front wheel hub components is four times more efficient than using a general welding machine.

    五用交流电焊机
    贵州汽车制造厂电焊工、共产党员白玉才最近制成一台五用交流电焊机。
    这种电焊机除了具有一般电焊机的能焊、能割两种作用之外，还能碰焊、钻眼和焊接各种大小刀具。利用这种电焊机焊割汽车前轮心部件，比一般电焊机的工效高四倍。
