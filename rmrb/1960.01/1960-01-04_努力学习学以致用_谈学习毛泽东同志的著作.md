    Strive to Study and Apply What You Learn
    ——On Studying Comrade Mao Zedong's Works
  　Li Da
    In recent years, more and more people are studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and the study is becoming more and more in-depth. A high tide of studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works is about to sweep across the country. This is a new realm and a new stage on China's theoretical front.
    Mao Zedong Thought is the product of the integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. It "is the highest expression of the wisdom of the Chinese nation and the highest standard in theory" (Liu Shaoqi: "On the Party"). Over the years, the theories and policies of the democratic revolution, the theories and policies of the socialist revolution, and the theories and policies of socialist construction formulated by the Party Central Committee based on Mao Zedong Thought "are completely Marxist and completely Chinese" (Liu Shaoqi: "On the Party"). Relying on these theories and policies, our Party has mobilized and organized the masses of the people throughout the country to carry out one revolution after another, advancing from victory to victory. It can be said that the victory of the Chinese revolution is the victory of Marxism-Leninism, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's works are rich and colorful, full of vitality, and include expositions on philosophy, economics, politics, education, literature, and art. These are all conclusions drawn by applying Marxist-Leninist theory to the study of the characteristics of Chinese history and culture, as well as the political and economic conditions. In the ten years since the founding of the country, philosophers, social scientists, educators, literary and art workers, and other theoretical workers, all those who have implemented Mao Zedong Thought in their professional fields have been able to achieve new results.
    Mao Zedong Thought, from its worldview to its methodology and work methods, is a developing and perfecting Chinese Marxism, and is the scientific theory of socialist revolution and socialist and communist construction. All theoretical and practical workers must strive to study Mao Zedong Thought and use it to solve theoretical and practical problems in socialist revolution and socialist construction. This will undoubtedly improve their political and theoretical levels.
    Here, I just want to talk about how to study Mao Zedong Thought.
    How to study? I think: First of all, we must study "Reform Our Study" and "Rectify the Party's Style of Work." The methods of studying Marxism indicated in these two articles are also completely applicable to the study of Mao Zedong Thought. The main idea of ​​the two articles is: If we want to study Marxism-Leninism, we must first correct our attitude towards study. This attitude is the "Marxist-Leninist attitude." This attitude is the attitude of aiming at the target, and the attitude of seeking truth from facts. To this end, we must first learn Marxist-Leninist theory well, be able to master it proficiently, apply it, and be able to "correctly interpret the actual problems that occur in history and in the revolution based on the stand, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism, and be able to give scientific explanations and theoretical explanations on China's economic, political, military, and cultural issues." When we study Mao Zedong Thought, we must first learn from Comrade Mao Zedong's example of how to apply Marxist-Leninist theory and methods to study China's revolution and construction issues and thus draw conclusions.
    After correcting our attitude towards study, we must further study Comrade Mao Zedong's thinking methods, that is, study his works on epistemology.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's works on epistemology have three basic principles: First, implement the principle of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution; second, implement dialectical materialism, that is, use the method of analyzing contradictions and the method of class analysis; third, emphasize the important role of practice in the process of cognition, "the viewpoint of practice is the only and basic viewpoint of the theory of knowledge of dialectical materialism." Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On Practice" that practice is the basis of knowledge and the criterion of the truth of knowledge.
    According to the explanation of "On Practice," cognition originates from practice and serves practice. That is to say, cognition starts from practice and returns to practice. Therefore, the process of cognition can be expressed by the following formula:
    Practice——Cognition——Practice——Starting from practice means starting from perceptual knowledge, because perceptual knowledge is the impression people get of external things in practice. Therefore, the formula of the cognitive process can be rewritten as the following formula:
    Perceptual Knowledge——Rational Knowledge——Practice——"On Contradiction" points out that everything in the world contains inherent contradictions and is a developmental process of the unity of opposites. In the process of development of each thing, there is a contradictory movement from beginning to end. Therefore, when we recognize any external thing, we must use the method of analyzing contradictions to reveal the internal contradictions of that thing, and study the situation of both sides of the contradiction and the entire process of their struggle and mutual transformation. After such an analysis of contradictions, we can do synthesis work. Accompanying the process of analysis and synthesis, we must also go through the process of creating concepts, making judgments, and reasoning. Through this series of logical operations, we can draw conclusions that conform to the laws of objective things, that is, reach rational knowledge. Then, according to rational knowledge, formulate plans or programs to guide practice, and use practice to test whether the knowledge is correct. If the expected goal can be achieved in practice, the movement of cognition of this thing is considered complete.
    Here, I do not intend to explain the content of "On Practice" in detail, but to return to the formula "Practice——Cognition——Practice." As mentioned earlier, the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism must be combined with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, the practice we are talking about must be the "concrete practice of the Chinese revolution," that is, the practice of the production struggle and class struggle of the broad masses of the Chinese people. Because apart from the practice of the production struggle and class struggle of the masses, there can be no other practice. Our cause of democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction is the cause of the people's own liberation. The Party serves the people wholeheartedly. The Party can only closely link with the masses, firmly trust the masses, and lead the masses to fight to the end for this cause of liberation. To this end, the formulation of the Party's policies, plans, and programs on revolution and construction must concentrate the wisdom and opinions of the masses and summarize the experience of the masses' production struggle and class struggle in order to give full play to the revolutionary spirit and creativity of the masses and enable this cause of liberation to achieve complete victory. Therefore, the Party Central Committee, represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, created the epistemological theory of the leadership method (or work method) of combining leadership and the masses as early as the democratic revolution period. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote this in "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership":
    "In all practical work of our Party, all correct leadership must be from the masses, to the masses. This means: take the ideas of the masses (scattered and unsystematic ideas) and concentrate them (through study turn them into concentrated and systematic ideas), then go to the masses to propagate and explain them and turn them into the ideas of the masses, so that the masses persevere in these ideas and translate them into action and test the correctness of these ideas in such action. Then once again concentrate ideas from the masses and once again go to the masses so that the ideas are persevered in and carried out. And so on, over and over again in an endless spiral, with the ideas becoming more correct, more vital and richer each time. Such is the Marxist theory of knowledge."
    The process of coming from the masses is the process from practice to cognition, and it is the process of investigation and research. Leaders must throw themselves into the masses, humbly learn from the masses, adopt various investigation methods, and collect opinions from the masses in all aspects (that is, occupy the materials in detail). Among these opinions of the masses, there are always distinctions between the more advanced, the intermediate, and the backward. According to the mass line, we must attach importance to the advanced opinions, but we must take care of the opinions of the majority of the intermediate masses and the opinions of some backward masses. Therefore, leaders must, under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist theory, use the method of analyzing contradictions to specifically analyze those scattered and unsystematic opinions of the masses, and go through the work of removing the crude and extracting the essence, removing the false and preserving the true, proceeding from this to that, and from the surface to the inside, to transform and create a system of theories and concepts. That is to say, transform the scattered and unsystematic opinions of the masses into concentrated and systematic opinions (rational knowledge). Therefore, the process of coming from the masses is also the process of concept formation, the process of judgment formation, and the process of reasoning. Secondly, the process of going to the masses is the process from cognition to practice. In this process, leaders formulate plans and programs based on that concentrated and systematic opinion and take them to the masses to persevere in. At the level of cognition, concentrated and systematic opinions are a higher level of things than scattered and unsystematic opinions. In order to make the plans or programs willingly accepted by the general public (especially the intermediate and backward masses) and consciously and voluntarily implemented, it is necessary to do patient and meticulous publicity and explanation work to them. If the masses are persuaded and consciously and voluntarily implement the plans of the higher authorities, this concentrated and systematic opinion will be transformed into the opinions of the masses. Once the theory grasps the masses, it becomes a material force. For example, the National Program for Agricultural Development, the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and the general line for socialist construction have all been formulated after repeatedly going through the process of coming from the masses and going to the masses. Therefore, they can grasp the masses of the people throughout the country, promote the enthusiasm and pioneering spirit of the people, muster revolutionary vigor, and set off a high tide of continuous great leaps forward in all aspects of the economy and culture.
    The above briefly describes Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of knowledge (only its important parts, not all of it). After we have studied this theory of knowledge, we can understand Comrade Mao Zedong's thinking methods and work methods. However, after we have studied Mao Zedong Thought and learned his thinking methods and work methods, we must also learn to apply it. To apply it, research materials are indispensable. For example, a worker has the knowledge to manufacture a certain product and has production tools, but if there is no suitable material, he cannot manufacture any product. Where do our research materials come from? From the masses! To this end, we must go to the masses, to factories and rural areas, share labor, destiny, and breath with the workers and peasants, and sincerely learn from the workers and peasants. When we ourselves are truly a member of the masses, we can do detailed investigation work, accumulate rich materials, and carry out research work. If we can apply Comrade Mao Zedong's thinking methods to explain one or two practical problems in the process of socialist construction, then it can be considered that we have achieved some success. Just as Comrade Mao Zedong encouraged us: "The more you explain, the more universal, and the more profound, the greater your achievements." Philosophers, social scientists, literary and art workers, and educators across the country should establish a proletarian worldview and thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois worldview. We must strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, implement Mao Zedong Thought in scientific research and teaching work, combine theoretical work with the spirit of the times, cultivate a new style of study, and climb to new stages.

    努力学习学以致用
    ——谈学习毛泽东同志的著作
  　李达
    近几年来，学习毛泽东同志的著作的人越来越多了，学习也越来越深入了，全国即将汇成一个学习毛泽东同志的著作的高潮。这是我国理论战线上的新境界、新阶段。
    毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的产物，“是中国民族智慧的最高表现和理论上的最高标准”（刘少奇：“论党”）。历年以来，我党中央根据毛泽东思想制定的民主主义革命的理论和政策、社会主义革命的理论和政策、社会主义建设的理论和政策等，“是完全马克思主义的，又完全是中国的。”（刘少奇：“论党”）我党凭借这些理论和政策，动员并组织全国人民群众进行了一次又一次革命，从胜利走向胜利。可以说，中国革命的胜利是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    毛泽东同志的著作丰富多采，生气勃勃，其中有哲学、经济、政治、教育、文艺等方面的论述，这些都是运用马克思列宁主义的理论研究中国历史的文化的特点和政治经济的状况所得的结论。建国十年来，哲学社会科学工作者、教育工作者、文艺工作者和其他理论工作者们，凡是把毛泽东思想贯彻于自己的专业方面的，都能够做出新的成绩来。
    毛泽东思想，从宇宙观到思想方法、工作方法，是发展着和完善着的中国化的马克思主义，是社会主义革命和社会主义、共产主义建设的科学理论。一切理论工作者和实际工作者，都必须努力学习毛泽东思想，并运用来解决社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的理论问题和实际问题，就可以提高自己的政治水平和理论水平，这是没有疑义的。
    在这里，我只想谈谈怎样学习毛泽东思想这个问题。
    怎样学习呢？我以为：首先要学习“改造我们的学习”和“整顿党的作风”。这两篇文章中所指示的学习马克思主义的方法，对于学习毛泽东思想也是完全适用的。那两篇文章的大意是：我们要学习马克思列宁主义，必先端正学习的态度，这种态度就是“马克思列宁主义的态度”。这种态度就是有的放矢的态度，就是实事求是的态度。为此，必先学好马克思列宁主义的理论，要能够精通它，应用它，要能够“依据马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，正确地解释历史中和革命中所发生的实际问题，能够在中国的经济、政治、军事、文化种种问题上给予科学的解释、给予理论的说明。”我们学习毛泽东思想，首先要学习毛泽东同志如何应用马克思列宁主义的理论和方法去研究中国的革命和建设问题因而作出结论的那种榜样。
    在端正了学习的态度以后，就要进一步学习毛泽东同志的思想方法，即学习他的关于认识论的著作。
    毛泽东同志关于认识论的著作有三个基本原则：其一，贯彻马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的原则；其二，贯彻唯物主义辩证法，即运用矛盾的分析方法、阶级的分析方法；其三，强调实践在认识过程中的重要作用，“实践的观点是辩证唯物论的认识论之唯一的与基本的观点”。所以毛泽东同志在“实践论”中指出：实践是认识的基础，是认识的真理性的标准。
    按照“实践论”的说明，认识从实践发生，又为实践服务。这就是说，认识从实践出发，又复归于实践。因此，认识的过程，可以用下列的公式表达出来。
    实践——认识——实践——从实践出发即是从感性认识出发，因为感性认识是人们在实践中接触于外界事物所得的印象。所以认识过程的公式又可以改写为下式，即：
    感性认识——理性认识——实践——“矛盾论”指出，世界任何事物都含有内在的矛盾，都是矛盾统一体的发展过程，每一事物的发展过程中存在着自始至终的矛盾运动。所以我们认识外界任何事物时，就要用矛盾的分析方法，揭露出那个事物的内部矛盾，研究矛盾双方的情况及其经过斗争而互相转化的全部过程。在经过这样的分析矛盾之后，就可以做综合工作。伴随于分析和综合的过程，又要经过造概念、下判断和进行推理的过程。通过这一番逻辑操作，就可以作出合乎客观事物的规律性的结论，即到达于理性认识。于是根据理性认识拟定计划或方案，用以指导实践，并通过实践来检验认识是否正确。如果在实践中能够实现预想的目的，对于这一事物的认识运动算是完成了。
    在这里，我不打算详细说明“实践论”的内容，而要回到“实践——认识——实践”那个公式。前面说过，马克思列宁主义的普遍真理要和中国革命的具体实践相结合，因此，我们所说的实践必须是“中国革命的具体实践”，也就是中国广大群众的生产斗争和阶级斗争的实践。因为除了群众的生产斗争和阶级斗争的实践，就不能再有别的实践。我们的民主主义革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业，都是人民群众自己解放自己的事业，党是全心全意为人民群众服务的，党只有密切地联系群众，坚决地信任群众，领导群众为这一解放事业奋斗到底。为此，党关于革命和建设的政策、计划和方案的制订，必须集中群众的智慧和意见，总结群众生产斗争和阶级斗争的经验，才能发挥群众的革命性和创造性，使这一解放事业能够取得完全胜利。因此，以毛泽东同志为代表的党中央，早在民主革命时期，就创造了领导和群众相结合的领导方法（或工作方法）的认识论的理论。毛泽东同志在“关于领导方法的若干问题”中，这样写着：
    “在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。这就是说，将群众的意见（分散的无系统的意见）集中起来（经过研究化为集中的系统的意见），又到群众中去作宣传解释，化为群众的意见，使群众坚持下去，见之于行动，并在群众运动中考验这些意见是否正确。然后再从群众中集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去。如此无限循环，一次比一次地更正确，更生动，更丰富。这就是马克思主义的认识论。”
    从群众中来的过程是从实践到认识的过程，是调查和研究的过程。领导者必须投身到群众中去，虚心向群众学习，采取各种调查方法，搜集群众各方面的意见（即详细地占有材料）。群众的这些意见中，总有比较先进的、中间的和落后的区别。按着群众路线，要重视先进的意见，但必须照顾多数的中间群众的意见和部分落后群众的意见。因此，领导都要在马克思列宁主义理论指导之下，运用矛盾分析的方法，具体地分析群众中的那些分散的无系统的意见，经过去粗取精、去伪存真，由此及彼、由表及里的改造制作的工夫，造成理论及概念的系统，即是说，把群众分散的无系统的意见，化为集中的系统的意见（理性认识），所以从群众中来的过程，又是概念形成的过程、判断形成的过程和推理进行的过程。其次，到群众中去的过程是从认识到实践的过程。在这段过程中，领导者根据那个集中的系统的意见制定计划和方案，拿到群众中坚持下去。在认识水平上，集中的系统的意见，比较分散的无系统的意见是高一级的东西。为要使计划或方案为一般群众（特别是中间的和落后的群众）所乐意接受而自觉自愿地去执行，必须向他们做耐心细致的宣传解释工作。群众如果被说服了，自觉自愿地执行上级的计划了，这个集中的系统的意见就化为群众的意见，理论一旦掌握群众就成为物质的力量。例如，农业发展纲要、农业“八字宪法”和社会主义建设总路线，都是反复地经过了从群众中来和到群众中去的过程然后制订出来的。所以它们能够掌握全国人民群众，发扬人民群众的积极性和首创精神，鼓足革命干劲，掀起经济和文化各方面持续大跃进的高潮。
    以上简略地叙述了毛泽东同志的认识论的理论（只是它的重要部分而不是全部）。我们学习了这个认识论的理论之后，就可以理会毛泽东同志的思想方法和工作方法。但是，我们学习了毛泽东思想，学习了他的思想方法和工作方法，还必须学会应用它才行，若要应用它，没有研究资料是不行的。譬如一个工人，他有制造某种产品的知识，又有生产工具，但若没有适当的材料，是不能制造出什么产品来的。我们的研究资料从哪里来呢？从群众中来！为此，我们就必须到群众中去，到工厂和农村中去，同工农群众同劳动，同命运，共呼吸，诚心诚意向工人农民学习。自己已经真正是群众中的一分子了，就可以做细致的调查工作，就可以积累起丰富资料，开展研究工作。倘若我们能够应用毛泽东同志的思想方法，说明社会主义建设过程中一两个实际问题，那就算有了几分成绩。正如毛泽东同志所鼓励我们的那样：“被你说明的东西越多，越普遍，越深刻，你的成绩就越大。”全国哲学社会科学工作者、文艺工作者和教育工作者都应当确立无产阶级世界观，彻底清除资产阶级世界观，我们要努力钻研毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想贯彻到科学研究和教学工作中去，把理论工作和时代精神结合起来，蔚成新的学风，攀登新的阶段。
