Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 15th. Workers at Wuhan Iron and Steel Company are seizing the time to prepare, determined to create even better production results during the Spring Festival than the "good start" they had on New Year's Day.

    In order to achieve a "good start" for the Spring Festival and to adapt to the needs of increased production, the workers of the steelmaking plant are rushing to install the third ingot crane and molten iron crane, increasing equipment such as steel ladles, slag pots, and furnace repair machines to put them into production before the Spring Festival. At the same time, they are launching a joint problem-solving technical performance competition to improve their operating skills and increase the daily output of steel. They are also inspecting mechanical equipment, strengthening maintenance, and ensuring no accidents occur. Plant cadres are also working alongside the workers, promptly identifying problems and helping to solve them, so that the work of the departments can quickly keep up with the development of production. The Party committee of the ironmaking plant has organized a working group to go to the sintering workshop to take measures with the workers to increase the production of sintered ore by one-third in the short term, ensuring that the blast furnace is well-fed. Blast furnace workers have recently been focusing on technical operation to ensure that the furnace temperature is stable and the output increases after loading more sintered ore. Workers in other workshops and departments are also adapting to the needs of increased blast furnace production and are carrying out a "one-dragon" competition. All departments of the company are also preparing to properly arrange the lives of employees and rotating holidays during the Spring Festival, and organize artistic performances and gatherings. The sports meet held to welcome the Spring Festival is about to begin.

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th. On the basis of achieving a good start in production in the New Year, the workers of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant are determined to win another good start in production during the Spring Festival. From the 1st to the 13th, the plant's total output value has completed 80.3% of the monthly plan, and commodity products have completed 64.9% of the monthly plan, with product quality generally reaching the national standards.

    The plant's employees put forward the slogan "Don't slack off before and after the Spring Festival, and strive for a full red victory in February," determined to complete the January production plan ahead of schedule and comprehensively overfulfill it, and make various preparations for a good start in production during the Spring Festival. They enthusiastically participated in the technical innovation competition, realizing 1,302 technical innovations, which improved production efficiency and further improved the plant's level of mechanization; at the same time, they overhauled major equipment such as the three-ton electric furnace and three-ton steam hammer, as well as other machinery and equipment, strengthening maintenance to ensure safe production.

    The factory leadership has decided to adopt a shift-based non-stop operation method so that production does not stop and employees can take holidays in rotation. Service department personnel are also making preparations in all aspects to support production workers in achieving a good start during the Spring Festival.
