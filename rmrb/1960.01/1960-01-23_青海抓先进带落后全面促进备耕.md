Xinhua News Agency, Xining: Qinghai Province's agricultural areas have promoted the current spring plowing preparation work through comprehensive inspections.

This year, the spring plowing preparation work in Qinghai's agricultural areas has been grasped earlier and done more meticulously than in previous years.

In inspecting spring plowing preparations, various regions, in addition to affirming achievements, summarizing experiences, commending advanced units, and establishing typical examples, have also adopted the method of grasping both ends to bring along the middle. They held on-the-spot meetings, using the examples of two production teams, one with good and one with poor preparation work, for comparison, summarizing experiences, and promoting spring plowing preparation work. During inspections, the Zongzhai Commune in Xining City used an on-the-spot meeting to promote the Shenjiazhai Production Team's experience of rapid progress in spring plowing preparation, helping the Xiejiazhai Production Team, which was making slower progress, arrange its labor force. When the Shangxinzhuang Commune in Huangzhong County inspected, it discovered that half of the Shangxiamen Production Team's fertilizer had not yet been delivered to the fields. The Party branch promptly organized a specialized team to rush the fertilizer delivery. The Jiaya Production Team also grasped the weak link of slow fertilizer delivery through inspection, accelerating the delivery of fertilizer on the one hand and rushing to make vehicles on the other. The production team's farm implement repair shop newly manufactured and repaired 49 various vehicles in two days, solving the problem of fertilizer delivery tools.

    青海抓先进带落后全面促进备耕
    据新华社西宁讯　青海省农业区各地通过全面大检查，推动了当前的备耕工作。
    今年青海农业区各地备耕工作比往年抓得早，做得细致。
    各地在检查春耕准备中，除了肯定成绩，总结经验，表彰先进，树立典型以外，还采取抓两头带中间的方法，召开现场会，用备耕工作做得较好的和较差的两个生产队的事例作了对比，总结经验，推动备耕工作。西宁市总寨公社在检查中，利用现场会议推广了沈家寨生产队备耕进展快的经验，帮助进展较慢的谢家寨生产队安排了劳力。湟中县上新庄公社在检查时发现上峡门生产队的肥料还有一半没送到地里，党支部就及时组织专业队突击送肥；加牙生产队也通过检查，抓住送肥慢的薄弱环节，一方面抓紧送肥，一方面赶制车辆，生产队的农具修配厂在两天内就新制和修理好各种车辆四十九辆，解决了送肥工具问题。
