    Ant Island Commune Uses Motorized Sailing Boats for All Offshore Fishing
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Ant Island People's Commune in Zhoushan County, Zhejiang Province, relying on the great strength of the commune, achieved the motorization of fishing vessel production ahead of schedule in 1959. The fishermen of Ant Island, who had been using wooden sailboats for generations, have since entered a new era: offshore fishing has been motorized, and inshore production has been motorized with tugboats. This is a great victory in the technological revolution of fishery production.
    Motorized sailboats are large fishing boats powered by machines, with advantages such as high fish catches, high speed, good safety, and low cost. With the same labor, a motorized sailboat can produce three to five times more fish than a wooden sailboat. Not long after liberation, the fishermen of Ant Island, who had only a dozen dilapidated wooden sailboats, saw the many advantages of the state-owned aquatic products company's motorized sailboats, and made a great ambition to strive for the use of motorized sailboats as their goal. In the fourth quarter of 1959, the Ant Island Commune added fifteen motorized sailboats. Together with the ten motorized sailboats purchased in the past few years, the commune now has a total of twenty-five motorized sailboats, realizing the motorization of fishery production.
    The realization of motorized fishery production in the Ant Island Commune is the result of resolutely implementing the Party's policy of running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. For the six years since Ant Island implemented the "one island, one township, one commune" system, it has always adhered to the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily and running households diligently and thriftily. Commune members have been diligent and thrifty in peacetime, going out to sea more and casting nets frequently. Even when the fishing ground climate is bad, they insist on production, so fishery production has risen sharply. The 1958 output increased by more than fifteen times compared with 1949 before liberation. With the rapid development of production, the income of Ant Island fishermen has also continued to increase. However, under the leadership and education of the Party, the fishermen, based on the principle of "small streams flow long," accumulate more and invest more. Each time the profits are distributed, they ensure that accumulation grows first. Commune members throughout the commune also generally formulated plans for careful calculation and frugal living, and actively deposited and invested in the commune. Therefore, in the three years from 1956 to 1958, the Ant Island Commune used its own accumulated funds to add ten motorized sailboats one after another. In 1959, the Ant Island Commune achieved another great leap forward in fishery production, and the public accumulation of the entire commune also increased to more than one million yuan. The commune allocated more than 330,000 yuan to buy fifteen diesel engines and installed them as motorized sailboats, increasing the number of motorized sailboats in the commune to twenty-five. Calculated according to the commune's more than 500 households, there is an average of one motorized sailboat for every twenty households. Therefore, all commune members who go to offshore fishing grounds to fish in the future can use motorized sailboats. In addition to offshore fishing operations, the Ant Island Commune also engages in inshore net fishing operations all year round, and dozens of small fishing boats for inshore production are also towed by motorized sailboats.
    In the past six years, the main fishing tool of the fishermen of Ant Island, fishing boats, has undergone tremendous changes: from small to large, from old to new, from few to many, from wooden sails to motorized sails, fully reflecting the infinite vitality of the people's commune. In addition to accumulating sufficient funds to purchase motorized sailboats, the Ant Island Commune has also solved problems such as machine repair and technical strength through self-reliance. The commune has established a mechanical repair factory, which is now able to undertake the general repair and installation of motorized sailboats. Since this year, the commune's mechanical repair factory has installed and repaired ten motorized sailboats. The Ant Island Commune has also adopted methods such as sending people to learn, inviting people to teach, training themselves, and having experienced workers guide new ones, training more than 100 skippers, netters, and mechanics on motorized sailboats, meeting the needs of technical personnel after the increase in motorized sailboats. Now, the mechanics who operate the machines on the motorized sailboats are all outstanding young commune members selected by the commune. After a short period of study and training, they quickly mastered the technology.
    Although the Ant Island Commune has already realized the motorization of fishing, they are not satisfied at all, and they continue to run forward without stopping. Now the Party Committee of the Ant Island Commune has formulated a grand prospective plan, aiming at new goals: mechanization in the front, factoryization and electrification in the rear, and striving to use the most modern fishing tools - fishing vessels - as soon as possible.

    勤俭办社　勤俭持家　增加积累　发展生产
    蚂蚁公社远洋捕鱼全用机帆船
    本报讯　浙江省舟山县蚂蚁人民公社依靠公社巨大力量，在1959年内提前实现了渔业生产机帆船化。世世代代用木帆船捕鱼的蚂蚁岛渔民，从此跨进了一个新的时代：远洋捕鱼实现渔船机帆化，近海生产实现拖驳机帆化，这是渔业生产技术革命中的伟大胜利。
    机帆船是用机器作动力的大型渔船，具有捕鱼多、速度快、安全好、费用省等优越性，同样劳力用机帆船捕鱼，一船要比用木帆船捕鱼增产三倍到五倍。刚解放不久，只有十几只破旧木帆船的蚂蚁岛渔民，看到了国营水产公司的机帆船有许多好处，就立下雄心大志，把争取使用机帆船作为努力的目标。1959年第四季度，蚂蚁公社增添了十五艘机帆船，加上过去几年中置办的十艘机帆船，现在全社共有机帆船二十五艘，实现了渔业生产机帆船化。
    蚂蚁公社实现渔业生产机帆船化，是坚决贯彻执行党的勤俭办一切事业的方针的结果。蚂蚁岛实行一岛一乡一社六年来，一直坚持勤俭办社、勤俭持家的方针，平时克勤克俭，社员们多出海、勤下网，渔场气候不好，也坚持生产，因而渔业产量直线上升，1958年产量比解放前的1949年增加了十五倍多。随着生产的迅速发展，蚂蚁岛渔民收入也不断增加。但是，渔民们在党的领导和教育下，根据细水长流的原则，多积累，多投资，每次收益分配时，都保证积累优先增长。全社社员还普遍制订了精打细算、省吃俭用的计划，踊跃在社里存款和投资。因此，1956年到1958年的三年中，蚂蚁公社用自己的积累资金先后添置了十艘机帆船。1959年，蚂蚁公社渔业生产又获得了大跃进，全社的公共积累也增加到一百多万元。公社拨出了三十三万多元新买了十五台柴油机，安装成机帆船，使全社机帆船增加到二十五艘。按全社五百多户社员计算，平均二十户社员就有一艘机帆船了。因此，全社去远洋渔场捕鱼的社员，今后都可以使用机帆船捕鱼了。蚂蚁公社除了远洋捕捞作业外，一年四季还从事近海张网作业，近海生产的几十只小渔船也用机帆船拖驳了。
    六年来，蚂蚁岛渔民捕鱼的主要工具渔船起了巨大的变化：由小到大，由旧到新，由少到多，由木帆到机帆，充分反映出人民公社的无限生命力。蚂蚁公社除了积累充足的资金购置机帆船外，同时自力更生地解决了机器修配和技术力量等问题。这个公社办起了机械修配厂，目前自己已经能担负机帆船的一般修理和安装，今年以来公社的机械修配厂就安装和修理了十艘机帆船。蚂蚁公社还采取派去学、请来教、自己训、老带新等办法，培养训练了一百多名机帆船上的老大、出网和轮机员，满足了机帆船增加后技术人员的需要。现在，机帆船上操纵机器的轮机手全是公社挑选出来的青年优秀社员，他们经过短期的学习训练后，很快地掌握了技术。
    蚂蚁公社虽然已经实现捕鱼机帆化了，但是他们毫不满足，他们一刻也不停地继续向前奔跑。现在蚂蚁公社党委已制订出宏伟的前景规划，向着新的奋斗目标：前方机械化，后方工厂化、电气化，争取早日使用现代化的最新捕鱼工具——渔轮捕鱼。（附图片）
