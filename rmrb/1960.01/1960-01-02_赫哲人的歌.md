    The Hezhe People's Song
    Lù Fúwéi
    We sailed along the desolate Heilongjiang River for a day, and the black night quietly descended. In the dark, dense thickets, starlight-like fishing fires lit up, and the river breeze carried a fragrance of flowers, along with a melodious tune. The steamboat slowly approached the shore, and a young Hezhe man turned on a flashlight, warmly shook my hand, and said in somewhat broken Chinese, "You've come at the perfect time, just in time! Tonight, the club is putting on a show!"
    Bright gasoline lamps shone like daylight, and over two hundred people were squeezed into a not-so-spacious room. A girl named Bì Shūyún was standing on the stage singing a folk song called "Memories." Although I didn't understand the Hezhe language, her sincere and profound emotion deeply shook me. The song was full of pain and sorrow, causing the old ladies to cover their faces and sob, and even the Hezhe heroes, known for their bravery and stubbornness, to shake their heads and sigh... Suddenly, like a thousand-year-old frozen river thawing, the song filled with joyful and excited passion. People's emotions underwent a dramatic change, and pairs of deep dark eyes sparkled with gratitude and happiness... At the end of the song, the Hezhe people excitedly stood up, some wiping away tears with excitement, others enthusiastically applauding and cheering. This heart-stirring scene deeply moved me, and I wondered silently: What had made these intelligent and brave Hezhe people unable to control their emotions? What had they experienced in the past?
    As soon as it dawned, I walked through the dense thickets of aspen poplar trees to visit Bì Shūyún's home. Her door was blocked with woven bear fur, according to Hezhe custom, to keep out the wind and snow, but the house was furnished with chests, cabinets, tables, chairs, and many modern furniture pieces. I was surprised to find that this singing girl was already a mother of four children, and even more surprised when she told me that many Hezhe people had only seen their own ethnic song and dance for the first time last night. She recounted the extraordinary experiences of the Hezhe people to me.
    The Hezhe people, who have lived along the Heilongjiang River for generations, are not only skilled at fishing and hunting, but also capable of singing and dancing. In the past, they suffered greatly under the oppression of Qing Dynasty princes, and after the Japanese imperialists occupied the Northeast, the disaster became even more severe. The Japanese established "Agricultural Cooperatives for Rural Development" in Fuyuan, which specialized in exploiting the Hezhe people's catches. To prevent the Hezhe people from escaping, puppet police were stationed in every village along the river, and fishing boats were chained together at night. Many ferocious dogs were also tied around the villages, barking loudly at any disturbance. However, the strict blockade could never lock down hearts yearning for freedom and happiness. One night, Dǒng Guìfú, Bì Fāxiáng, and twenty others shook off the police's pursuit and crossed the river to socialist Soviet Union. The Japanese soldiers were furious and set fire to the Hezhe people's shacks along the river, forcing the remaining Hezhe people to move to deep mountain forests, forcing them to establish so-called "tribes."
    Thus began a tragic life of exile. For the Hezhe people, leaving the great river was like a fish leaving water, losing the conditions for survival. Along the way, people fell ill and died, abandoning their children, and families were torn apart. When they entered the great forest, they ate holly and yellow bran in the winter, and orache and bean cakes in the summer. If they couldn't find clear springs, they drank reddish water that tasted like horse urine. At this time, the Japanese soldiers sent a batch of wheat bran. After eating it, people's faces became bloated and swollen, and they contracted terrible diseases. First, the old and the children died, followed by the young and middle-aged. The Hezhe people, who were small in number, were gradually being exterminated...
    Finally, the clouds parted, and the sun shone through. The Soviet army liberated the Northeast. The Hezhe people who had fled abroad returned to their country, bringing with them a large number of cattle, fishing gear, and various supplies donated by the Soviet government. The Chinese Communist Party also helped the Hezhe people who had been wandering in the forests to move back to the riverbanks and rebuild their homes. From then on, a new and happy chapter was opened in the history of the Hezhe ethnic group. In addition to continuing to engage in fishing and hunting, they also cultivated land with the help of Han farmers, and ate the grain and vegetables they had grown themselves. In recent years, the simple shacks have been transformed into houses with bright glass windows, and every family has added clothing and bedding. Utensils made of birch bark have also been replaced with new furniture. Schools, health clinics, and clubs have also been established in the villages, ending the Hezhe people's years of poverty and lack of culture. During collectivization, all the Hezhe people joined the people's communes.
    Living in a large family of loving and united ethnic groups, the Hezhe people have received meticulous care. They sent representatives to participate in the Heilongjiang minority ethnic group visiting delegation to Beijing, where they met the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao. The representatives returned and conveyed the rapid development of construction throughout the country, further strengthening everyone's confidence in following the socialist path. When the representatives talked about the beautiful and rich song and dance arts of other ethnic groups, everyone's emotions boiled over. Didn't the Hezhe people have a lot of oral literature and song and dance arts? Could they let it be silently buried? Everyone decided to establish a Hezhe Ethnic Art Delegation. With the help of the Provincial Cultural Bureau, they initially unearthed and compiled more than thirty kinds of folk tales and ballads from the elders, as well as dances such as the Swan Dance, Shaman Dance, and Youth Dance, and many dramas. Who would perform these programs? The youth who had fled in the forest had become adults, and most of the children and infants at the time had been poisoned by the Japanese. It was difficult to find young girls and young men among the Hezhe people. At this time, Bì Shūyún, who already had four children, and many middle-aged women decided to play young girls, and Sòng Yóushì, who had been ill in bed for a long time, enthusiastically got up to teach the younger generation ethnic dances. In this way, the Hezhe people used art to narrate the history of the decline and prosperity of the smallest brother in the motherland's big family. When these programs were performed in Jiamusi, Harbin, and other places, they aroused the praise and resonance of people of all ethnic groups... After the art delegation returned, the Hezhe people scattered in various places requested a performance for their own ethnic group, because many of them had never seen their own ethnic song and dance. That is why last night's performance was so exciting.
    After Bì Shūyún finished telling the story, she said proudly to me, "Although the Hezhe people are one of the smallest ethnic groups in the motherland, we will dedicate everything beautiful we have to the motherland without reservation." I looked up and saw the aspen poplar trees outside the window dancing elegantly in the spring breeze, and the surging river water lapping against the fine sand on the shore. I thought: The Hezhe people are just like a bright pearl buried in the sand! In the past, no one paid attention to it, but under the impact of the revolutionary tide, bathed in the sunshine of socialism, it released dazzling light.

    赫哲人的歌
    陆拂为
    我们沿着渺无人烟的黑龙江航行了一天，黑色的夜幕悄悄地降落了。在黑沉沉的密树丛中亮起星星点点的渔火，江风送来一阵花香，传来了悠扬美妙的乐曲。汽船慢慢靠岸，一个赫哲小伙子亮起手电，热情地握着我的手，操着不很流利的汉语说：“你来得太好了，太巧了，今晚俱乐部里正在演节目哩！”
    明亮的汽油灯照耀如同白昼，在一间不很宽敞的屋子里，紧紧挤坐着二百多人。一位叫毕淑云的姑娘站在台上正唱一首叫作“回忆”的民谣。我虽不懂赫哲语，但她那真挚、深沉的感情却强烈地震撼了我。歌声充满了痛苦哀怨，使得老太太掩面唏嘘，使得一向以勇敢、倔强著称的赫哲英雄也摇头叹息……突然，就像千年冰河开了冻，歌声充满了欢乐欣喜的激情。人们的感情起了剧烈的变化，一双双深黑的眼睛里都闪耀着感激、幸福的光芒……歌唱结束时，赫哲人都激动地站起来，有的兴奋地抹着眼泪，有的热烈地鼓掌欢呼。这激动人心的场面深深地感动了我，我默默寻思：什么事情使这些聪明、勇敢的赫哲人无法控制自己的感情呢？在过去他们经历了些什么呢？
    天一明，我穿过密密丛丛的钻天杨林到毕淑云家去访问。她家的门口按照赫哲人的习惯，用编织起来的熊毛挡住风雪，但屋里却陈设了箱笼桌椅许多现代家具。我惊奇地发现这位唱歌的姑娘竟已是四个孩子的妈妈，更使我诧异的是她告诉我许多赫哲人昨晚还是第一次看到本民族的歌舞。她向我叙述了赫哲人不平凡的经历。
    世世代代居住在黑龙江边的赫哲人不仅是渔猎能手，而且人人能歌善舞。过去他们饱受清朝王爷的欺凌，而从日本帝国主义占领了东北后，灾难就更为深重。日本人在抚远办了“兴农合作社”，专事搜刮赫哲人的捕获物。为了防止赫哲人逃跑，沿江每个屯落都驻上伪警，夜晚把渔船连锁起来，屯落四周还拴上许多恶狗，一有响动就汪汪乱咬。但是，严密的封锁始终锁不住一颗颗向往自由、幸福的心，有一天晚上，董桂福、毕发祥等二十多人摆脱了警察的追踪，越江到了社会主义的苏联。日本兵大怒，放火烧光了江边赫哲人的窝棚，把其余的赫哲人集中赶往深山老林、强迫他们去建立所谓“部落”。
    就这样，悲惨的流亡生活开始了。赫哲人离开大江，就像鱼儿离开水，失掉了赖以生存的条件。一路上病的病，死的死，抛儿弃女，妻离子散。进了大森林，冬天吃冬青黄糠，夏天吃灰菜豆饼，找不到清泉，就喝马尿样的红锈水。这时，日本兵送来一批麦麸，人们吃后脸都虚胖发肿，传染了可怕的疾病。先是老人和小孩死亡，接着是青壮年，人数不多的赫哲人正被逐渐灭种……
    终于，拨开乌云见了天。苏军解放了东北。逃亡国外的赫哲人回国了，带回苏联政府赠送的大批耕牛、渔具和各种生活资料；中国共产党也帮助流浪在森林里的赫哲人迁回江边，重建家园。从此，在赫哲族的历史上揭开了新的幸福的一页。他们除了继续从事捕鱼打猎外，还在汉族农民的帮助下进行耕作，吃到了自己栽种的粮食和蔬菜。几年来，简陋的窝棚已变成有明亮玻璃窗的房屋，家家添了衣裳被服，桦树皮做的用具也变成新式的家具，村里还办起了学校、卫生所、俱乐部，结束了赫哲人多少年来没有文化、贫困的生活。公社化时，赫哲人全部参加了人民公社。
    生活在各民族友爱团结的大家庭中，赫哲人得到了无微不至的关怀。他们派了代表参加黑龙江各少数民族参观团到达北京，见到了各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席。代表们回来传达了祖国各地一日千里的建设事业，更坚定了大家走社会主义道路的信心。当代表们谈到其他各族人民优美丰富的歌舞艺术时，大家的情绪就沸腾起来了。赫哲人不是有许多口头文学和歌舞艺术吗？难道还能让它无声无息地埋没掉？大家决定成立赫哲人艺术代表团，在省文化局的帮助下，从老人中初步发掘整理了民间传说和歌谣各三十多种，还有天鹅舞、萨满舞、青年舞等舞蹈和许多戏剧。这些节目由谁来演出呢？流亡在森林时的青年已经成了壮年，当时的儿童和婴孩大部被日本人毒死了，赫哲人中已很难找到几个年青的姑娘和小伙子。这时，已有四个孩子的毕淑云和许多中年妇女决定扮演青年姑娘，年老久病在床的宋尤氏热情地起来为后辈传授民族舞蹈。就这样，赫哲人通过艺术叙述了祖国大家庭中最小的兄弟衰落和兴盛的历史。这些节目在佳木斯、哈尔滨等地演出时，引起各族人民的赞叹和共鸣……艺术代表团回来后，散居各地的赫哲人要求为本民族演出一场，因为他们之中有许多人还从没见过本民族的歌舞。这就是为什么昨晚演出那么激动人心的缘故。
    毕淑云讲完了故事，自豪地对我说：“赫哲人虽然是祖国人数最少的一个民族，但我们所有的一切美好的东西，都要毫无保留地献给祖国。”我抬起头，只见窗外的钻天杨在春风中潇洒起舞，汹涌的江水拍打着岸边的细沙。我想：赫哲人不就像埋没在沙土里的一颗明珠么！过去谁也没注意到它，但在革命浪潮的冲击下，沐浴了社会主义的阳光，它却放出眩人心目的光芒。
