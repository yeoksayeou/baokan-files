Vice Premier Li Xiannian's Speech at the Banquet Welcoming the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic

Respected Vice Premier Rau,
Respected Comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic,
Comrades, Friends,

The Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Vice Premier Heinrich Rau, has come to our country at the invitation of our government. Today, we are extremely happy to gather with them. Please allow me, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, to extend a warm welcome to our distinguished guests.

1959 was a year of greater unity and unprecedented growth for the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. In the past year, the countries of the socialist camp have achieved great victories in accelerating socialist and communist construction and in safeguarding world peace. The German Democratic Republic, like other socialist countries, has also achieved brilliant successes in all aspects. The seven-year plan for the development of the national economy, approved by the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic last October, demonstrates the great ambition and spirit of the people of the German Democratic Republic in building their motherland. The people of the German Democratic Republic have victoriously completed the first year's tasks set out in the seven-year plan, creating conditions for the early and overfulfillment of the entire seven-year plan. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the achievements of the fraternal people of the German Democratic Republic in socialist construction.

With the victorious development of socialist construction, the international status of the German Democratic Republic is constantly improving, and it is playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. As a strong fortress of the socialist camp on the western front, the German Democratic Republic has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, made tremendous efforts and contributions to safeguarding European and world peace, and has been making unremitting struggles to achieve the reunification of the motherland on a peaceful and democratic basis. The Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the German Democratic Republic and all the German people, and firmly believe that their struggle will achieve final victory.

The relations of friendship and cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, established on the basis of proletarian internationalism, are developing rapidly. Our two countries support and cooperate with each other in the international struggle to safeguard world peace and oppose imperialist aggression. Cooperation in the political, economic, cultural, scientific, and technological fields between the two countries is constantly strengthening. This increasingly broad and in-depth mutual assistance and cooperation has played a significant role in the socialist construction of our two countries. It should be particularly pointed out here that the German Democratic Republic has provided valuable assistance to China's economic construction in the past decade. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to the government and people of the German Democratic Republic. This time, the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Vice Premier Rau, has been invited to visit our country and will hold talks with our country on further strengthening economic cooperation between the two countries and major international issues of concern to both countries. I believe that your visit will make new contributions to the further development of the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries.

Comrades, friends, let us raise our glasses,

    For the further strengthening of the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and German people,
    For the leap forward in the socialist construction of our two countries,
    For the growing prosperity and unity of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
    For the health of Comrade Pieck, Comrade Ulbricht, and Comrade Grotewohl,
    For the health of all comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Vice Premier Rau,
    Cheers!

    在欢迎德意志民主共和国政府代表团宴会上
    李先念副总理讲话敬爱的劳副总理同志，敬爱的德意志民主共和国政府代表团的全体同志，同志们，朋友们，
    以海因里希·劳副总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团应我国政府的邀请，来到了我国。今天我们能够同他们欢聚一起，感到无比的高兴。请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。
    1959年是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加团结和空前壮大的一年。在过去的一年里，社会主义阵营各国在加速社会主义和共产主义建设以及维护世界和平的事业中都取得了伟大的胜利。德意志民主共和国也同其他社会主义国家一样，在各方面获得了辉煌的成就。去年10月德意志民主共和国人民议院批准的发展国民经济的七年计划显示了德意志民主共和国人民建设祖国的巨大雄心和气魄。德意志民主共和国人民已经胜利地完成了七年计划中所提出的第一年的任务，为提前和超额完成整个的七年计划创造了条件。中国人民对兄弟的德意志民主共和国人民在社会主义建设方面所取得的成就感到欢欣鼓舞。
    随着社会主义建设事业的胜利发展，德意志民主共和国的国际地位正在不断地提高，在国际事务中起着越来越大的作用。德意志民主共和国作为社会主义阵营在西方前线的坚强堡垒，一贯奉行和平外交政策，对保卫欧洲和世界和平作出了巨大的努力和贡献，并且为争取祖国在和平和民主的基础上达到统一进行着不懈的斗争。中国人民全力支持德意志民主共和国和全体德意志人民的正义斗争，并且深信，他们的斗争必将取得最后的胜利。
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国在无产阶级国际主义的基础上建立起来的友好和合作关系正在迅速发展。我们两国在维护世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略的国际斗争中相互支持和相互配合。两国的政治、经济、文化和科学技术等方面的合作正在不断加强。这种日益广泛和深入的互助和合作对我们两国的社会主义建设事业起了巨大的作用。在这里应该特别提出的是，德意志民主共和国在过去十年里对我国经济建设提供了可贵的帮助。我愿乘此机会向德意志民主共和国政府和人民表示衷心的感谢。这一次以劳副总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团应邀来我国访问，将同我国就进一步加强两国的经济合作以及两国所关心的重大国际问题进行会谈。我相信，你们的这一次访问必将对我们两国的友好和合作关系的进一步发展作出新的贡献。
    同志们，朋友们，让我们举杯，
    为中德两国人民牢不可破的友谊的进一步加强，
    为我们两国社会主义建设的飞跃发展，
    为以苏联为首的伟大社会主义阵营日益繁荣和团结，
    为皮克总统同志、乌布利希同志和格罗提渥同志的健康，
    为以劳副总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团全体同志们的健康，
    干杯。
