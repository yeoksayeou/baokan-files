    Hearing the Rat's Squeak in the Year of the Rat
    Poem by Chi Bei'ou, Drawing by Hua Junwu
    Slander is a waste of effort,
    Curses are to no avail,
    The Earth still revolves,
    China advances a thousand miles a day.
    How bitter for a handful of idiots,
    Who exhaust their minds in anti-China schemes,
    When reason fails, and plans are exhausted, and words are depleted,
    They can only beg help from the imperial calendar.
    It is said that every Gengzi year,
    Our country will always have bad luck,
    This year is again the Year of the Rat,
    Destined for a great catastrophe.
    They do not know what age this is today,
    And vainly attempt to replay history:
    To fight another Opium War,
    And raise the Eight-Nation Alliance flag again.
    Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak,
    The American propaganda machine,
    Its low intelligence reaches this point,
    Its vision is worse than a rat's,
    Its brain is dumber than a mouse's.
    Wanting to curse the sun to extinguish.
    Pitiful and ridiculous,
    Boring and shameless.
    According to a dispatch from the United Press International on the day of our Spring Festival, it said, "The Year of the Rat begins," and "If history repeats itself, this will be a disastrous year for China," hoping "to see the collapse of the Peking regime." It said: "1840 was the Year of the Rat, and the disaster that year was the Opium War, the result of which, among other things, was that Britain got Hong Kong. 1900 was also the Year of the Rat, and that year saw the Boxer Rebellion, which resulted in the Eight-Nation Alliance occupying Peking." It also said: "The Chinese calendar predicts that this year will bring more natural disasters to China. There will be little harvest, hunger will spread throughout the mainland, floods will occur in the spring and summer, and droughts will spread across the mainland in the autumn and winter..." It is truly a "brilliant new year piece," enough to amuse the people of our country who are continuing to leap forward. (Attached picture)

    鼠年闻鼠叫
    池北偶诗　华君武画
    诽谤白费力气，
    诅咒无济于事，
    地球照样运转，
    中国一日千里。
    苦煞一撮白痴，
    反华挖空心思，
    理屈计尽词穷，
    只好乞灵皇历。
    据说每逢庚子，
    我国总要晦气，
    今年又届鼠年，
    注定大祸将至。
    不知今日何世，
    妄图重演历史：
    再打鸦片战争，
    重举八国军旗。
    吱吱吱吱吱吱，
    美国宣传机器，
    低能竟至于此，
    目光不及老鼠，
    头脑蠢过耗子。
    想把太阳骂熄。
    可怜亦复可笑，
    无聊又兼无耻。
    据合众国际社在我国春节的日子发了一则电讯，说什么“鼠年开始”，“假如历史重演的话，对中国说来，这将是灾难的一年”，希望“看到北平政权崩溃”。它说：“1840年是鼠年，那一年的灾难是鸦片战争，其结果除了别的以外，英国得到了香港。1900年也是鼠年，那一年发生了义和团起义，其结果是八国联军占领北平”。它还说：“中国的历书预示，今年将给中国带来更多的自然灾难。收成将很少，饥饿将普及全大陆，春天和夏天将发生水灾，秋天和冬天旱灾将蔓延大陆。……”真是堪称“新春妙笔”，可博继续跃进的我国人民一粲。（附图片）
