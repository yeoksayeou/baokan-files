    Paper Tubes that Bring the Dead Back to Life
    In October of last year, a patient in extremely critical condition arrived at Hedong Hospital in Tianjin. Acute uremia had made it impossible for this patient to urinate for six consecutive days, and food could no longer be ingested.
    The hospital used a self-made "artificial kidney" machine to save the patient's life. The "artificial kidney" machine removed waste products from the patient's blood, allowing the temporarily dysfunctional kidneys to regain their function. Before the new year, the patient's urine output had returned to normal.
    The reason the "artificial kidney" machine was able to bring the dead back to life was mainly due to the role played by a kind of paper tube in the "artificial kidney" machine. This paper tube is called an "artificial kidney dialyzer tube." When blood passes through it, because it has a dialysis effect, waste products in the blood are discharged outside the tube.
    In the past, this kind of paper tube has always relied on imports from abroad, but now it has been manufactured in the Tianjin No. 1 People's Paper Mill. The workers and technicians of this factory, in the absence of technical data, solved a series of complex problems such as molding and medicinal liquid treatment. After the trial production was successful, they also received guidance from the hospital. After solving the quality problems, they finally produced high-quality paper tubes that met medical requirements.

    起死回生的纸管
    去年10月间，一位病情十分危急的患者来到了天津市河东医院。急性尿毒症使这位患者连续六天不能小便，饭食已经无法入口了。
    这个医院用自制的“人工肾”机抢救了病人的生命。“人工肾”机排除了病人血液中的废物，使暂时失去功能的肾脏又恢复了功能。年前，这位病人的尿量已经恢复了正常。
    “人工肾”机所以能够这样起死回生，主要是由于“人工肾”机中的一种纸管起了作用。这种纸管叫做“人工肾透折管”。血液通过它的时候，由于它有透折作用，血液中的废物就排出管外了。
    这种纸管过去一向靠国外进口，现在却在天津市第一人民造纸厂制成了。这个厂的工人和技术人员，在没有技术资料的情况下，解决了成型、药液处理等一系列复杂的问题。试制成功以后，又得到医院指导。解决了质量问题，最后，终于制出了合乎医疗要求的优质纸管。
