Fuyang Prefecture Soil Loading and Transport Tools Introduction
Editor's Note: Fuyang Prefecture is a model for high efficiency in water conservancy construction in Anhui Province. Building upon the technological innovations of 1958, this prefecture continued to vigorously engage in mass movements and made many significant reforms to water conservancy construction tools. The average daily work efficiency for the entire prefecture has reached 24.6 cubic meters. Today, our newspaper is publishing selected diagrams of advanced tools for reference.

	Automatic Loading and Unloading Train
	Creator: Li Guoduo, Guqiao Township Central Machinery Factory, Fengtai County.
	Structure: The train consists of a hopper, frame, automatic unloading mechanism, and operating handle. A horizontal brace and rope are installed on the right side of the hopper. The loading hopper is placed on a frame approximately 250 cm high, with a movable bottom and a live latch near the bottom.
	Use: Suitable for excavating river channels.
	Operation: Three people load the soil, and two people below push the train under the loading frame to pull the live latch and unload the soil. After the hopper is full, the train is pushed to the unloading point (the movable bottom can then be pulled up and the live latch secured to continue loading). At the unloading point, the hopper rope is released, and the soil is automatically dumped. Then, the hopper rope is tightened to return the hopper to its upright position.
	Efficiency: Operated by five people, at a transport distance of 21 meters, each person's daily work efficiency can reach 21 cubic meters of soil. 1. Loading Hopper 2. Support Frame 3.

	Comprehensive Utilization Soil Transport Device
	Creator: Sun Deqin, Shuangmiao Township, Guoyang County.
	Structure: Divided into a boom, handle, support rod, rope, pulley, and other parts. The upright support rod is 3 meters long, with a rotatable crossbeam on top. Each end of the crossbeam has a pulley, through which a rope passes to the handle. The boom (3 meters long) and the handle (2 meters long) are installed in movable boxes on the turntable and can move. A rope with a hook runs along the boom to the handle. Pulling the handle lifts the soil basket. When the soil basket is lifted to a high position, pulling the rope along the boom automatically unloads the soil.
	Efficiency: Operated by four people, with a transport distance of 12 meters, each person transports 14 cubic meters of soil per day. 1. Support Rod 2. Boom 3. Handle 4. Turntable 5. Pulley 6. Trolley 7. Track 8. Crossbeam

	Soil Splitting Device
	Creator: Wan Xinhou, Xiaojian Township, Mengcheng County.
	Structure: The frame is 140 cm high, 158 cm long, and 73 cm wide. The machine head is equipped with a lifting tooth frame, 150 cm long and 65 cm wide. The lower end of the vehicle head is fitted with small rollers, and the rear end is fitted with wooden wheels. The nail tooth frame is 120 cm high and 80 cm wide, with a thick iron sheet wrapped around the lower end and large iron nails of 40 cm length. The stone rammer is 40 cm high, 30 cm wide, and 56 cm long, and becomes a hammer when fitted with a wooden handle.
	Operation: One person stands on the frame and presses the lifting tooth frame with both hands, while stepping on the stone rammer handle. After the nail teeth enter the ground, two people press the nail tooth handle backward, and the sandy conglomerate can be split out.
	Use: Most suitable for digging hard sandy conglomerate soil.
	Efficiency: Operated by three people, on average, each person can loosen 83 cubic meters of soil per day. 1. Frame 2. Nail Teeth 3. Nail Tooth Frame 4. Lifting Tooth Frame 5. Stone Rammer 6. Small Roller 7. Wooden Wheel

	Relay Soil Transport Device
	Creator: Sanyiji Mechanical Factory, Mengcheng County.
	Structure: Composed of a hand-cranked winch, a soil transport car, an automatic unloading hopper, a bumping frame, a bumping wood (with bearings), a track, and other parts. The soil transport car has a movable bottom, with an arc-shaped plate nailed to the bottom, which automatically closes upon contact with the bumping wood. On the side of the soil transport car facing the bumping frame, there is a movable wooden hook, secured with a wooden card. Near the middle of the wooden hook is a spring-loaded pin that can spring open and close. In the track, there is a bumping wood with bearings, and the car bottom automatically closes when it rolls over the bumping wood. At one end of the track is an automatic unloading hopper, consisting of a box, frame, and movable support. At the other end is a bumping frame, which automatically unloads the soil when the soil transport car hits it. There is a heavy stone behind the unloading hopper.
	Operation: After filling the unloading hopper with soil, two people crank the winch to make the empty car on the inclined track slide down until the car hits the movable support, causing the soil in the unloading hopper to pour into the car. The car filled with soil on the flat track is simultaneously pulled by the traction rope to the bumping frame, causing the soil to automatically fall down. Then, the winch is cranked in reverse to make the heavy car on the inclined track slide up, and the empty car on the flat track moves closer to the inclined track until the positions of the two sliding cars overlap. The heavy car hits the bumping wood on the winch, automatically dumping the soil into the empty car, and a new transport process begins.
	Efficiency: On a river channel with a depth of 3 meters, a slope of 1:6, and a transport distance of 32 meters, five people operating can achieve an average daily work efficiency of 42 cubic meters per person.
	Advantages: Both inclined and flat slopes can be utilized.

	Automatic Clutch Powered Trolley
	Creator: Mao Qichang, Niqiu Township, Taihe County.
	Structure: Composed of wooden rails, a hopper, a clutch, an unloading hopper, power, and other parts. The length of the wooden rails is determined as needed, generally 20 to 25 meters, and the width is 80 cm, arranged in parallel as double rails. In front of the rotating roller, there is an outwardly extending tamping rod, called the clutch, which controls the rotating roller based on the principle of force redirection. The power winch is driven by a diesel engine. Two rotating rollers coaxial with the winch's large gear are controlled by the clutch to rotate cyclically in alternation. The hopper has a movable bottom with an automatic switch. The hopper is 85 cm long, 70 cm wide, and 40 cm deep. The unloading hopper is prepared for the hopper's soil. It consists of an unloading hopper, a movable support frame, a heavy stone, and other components. The unloading hopper's uprights are 170 cm high, and the movable support is 150 cm high.
	Operation: One person operates the powered trolley to pour the soil from the unloading hopper into the car. When the trolley rolls forward and hits the tamping rod, the car automatically unloads the soil. When the tamping rod is hit by the car, the corresponding rotating roller immediately stops rotating, and the other rotating roller starts to rotate, so the trolley continuously transports soil back and forth.
	Efficiency: Operated by seven people, at a horizontal distance of 8 meters and a vertical lift of 1 meter, each person can transport 30 cubic meters of soil per day.

    阜阳专区装土运土工具介绍
    编者按　阜阳专区是安徽省水利建设高工效的标兵之一。这个专区在1958年技术革新的基础上，继续大搞群众运动，对水利施工工具进行了许多重大的改革，全区平均日工效已达二十四点六公方。今天本报特选择一些先进工具图发表，供各地参考。
    自动装卸列车
    创造者：凤台县顾桥乡中心机械厂李贵多。
    构　造：列车由车斗、车架、自动倒土、扳动扶手组成。车斗的右边装一横撑和拉绳。装土斗安放在高约二百五十厘米的斗架上，斗底是活动的，斗架上靠近活底处装置活卡。
    用　途：适用于开挖河道。
    操作方法：三人装土，下面由二人将列车推到装土架下，即可拉动活卡卸土。车斗装满土后，将车推出（随即可将活底拉上，并拉动活卡卡紧，继续装土），到卸土地点，放松车斗拉绳，土即自动倒出。然后拉紧车斗拉绳，车斗即还正。
    功　效：五人操作，在运距二十一米时，每人每天工效可达二十一方土。1、装土斗2、支架3、装土斗活底4、活底拉绳5、活卡6、活卡拉绳7、滑轮8、土斗9、车架10、土斗拉绳11、扳动扶手12、铁轮

    接力运土器
    创造者：蒙城县三义集机械厂。
    构　造：由手摇辘轳、运土车、自动卸土斗、撞架、碰木（上有轴承）、轨道等部分组成。运土车是活动底，底板下面钉一条弧形板，一经碰木板即可自动关闭。运土车上向撞架的一面，装有活动的木钩，用木卡卡住车底；靠近木钩的中部，有一弹动活梢，可以弹动开关。在轨道中有一碰木，上有轴承，车底滚过碰木即自动关闭。轨道的一头是自动卸土斗，由箱斗、箱架、活动支撑组成，另一头是碰架，可以使运土车碰到架子时自动卸土。卸土斗后有一重石。
    操作方法：把卸土斗上满土后，二人摇动辘轳，使斜轨上的空车下滑，直到车碰到活动支撑，使卸土斗的土倒入车内；平轨上装满土的车，同时也由牵引绳牵到撞架，使土自动倒下。然后再反摇辘轳，使斜轨的重车上滑，平轨的空车向斜轨靠近，直到两车滑动位置重合。重车碰到辘轳上的撞木，即自动倒土入空车内，又开始一个新的运送过程。
    功　效：在沟深三米、坡度1∶6、运距三十二米的河道上，五人操作，平均每人每日工效可达四十二方。
    优　点：斜坡、平坡都可利用。

    自动离合动力滑车
    创造者：太和县倪丘乡毛其昌。
    构　造：由木轨、车斗、离合器、卸土斗、动力等部分组成。木轨长短根据需要决定，一般的是二十米到二十五米，宽八十厘米，并排成双轨。在转动磙的前方有向外伸展的捣杆，称为离合器，它根据力的变向原理来控制转动磙。动力绞关是由柴油机带动的。与绞关大齿轮同轴的两个转动磙，由离合器控制作周期性的轮换转动。车斗有活底，自动开关。车斗长八十五厘米，宽七十厘米，深四十厘米。卸土斗是为车斗预备土的。它由卸土斗、活动支撑斗架、重石等部件组成。卸土斗的站柱高一百七十厘米，活动支撑高一百五十厘米。
    操作方法：一人开动动力滑车，使卸土斗上的土倒入车内。当斗车往前滚动碰到捣杆，车即自动卸土。捣杆受车碰撞，相对的转动磙立即停止转动，另一转动磙开始转动，这样斗车就连续来回运土。
    工　效：七人操作，在平距八米、仰程一米，每人每天可运三十方土。
