    Epic of Heroes
    Fang Ping
    Forge steel into a golden pen,
    Take the earth as an eternal blueprint,
    Turn sweat into fragrant ink,
    Write a glorious history with labor.
    This history reveals golden characters,
    Each chapter is an epic of heroes,
    The Communist Party is the greatest author,
    Chairman Mao is both leader and mentor.
    This epic has a chapter: "1958,"
    Huge golden characters, adorned with red flowers;
    The General Line brings a great leap forward,
    Six hundred million people stride with giant steps.
    This epic also writes: "1959,"
    Huge golden characters, shining across the universe;
    Builders have climbed to new peaks,
    The further we look ahead, the more promising it becomes.
    We have an ambition to start a business,
    We have a pair of hands that can hold up the sky,
    We can create whatever we want,
    Saying this is definitely not empty boasting.
    We fight with the sky, we fight with the earth,
    With politics in command, there are tricks everywhere,
    Factories are overproducing every minute,
    Fields are harvesting bumper crops every season.
    We have built longer railways,
    We have built taller buildings,
    We have composed better songs,
    We have brewed sweeter wines.
    Singing triumphant songs and waving omnipotent hands,
    We have sent off the 1950s,
    Taking advantage of the spring warmth, flowers blooming, and a riot of color,
    It's the right time for the backward to catch up with the advanced!
    Everyone follows the Party wholeheartedly,
    The road ahead is getting wider and wider,
    The first shot of this year has already been fired,
    This epic has written a new chapter!

    英雄的史诗
    放平
    把钢铁铸成金质的大笔，
    把大地当作永在的图纸，
    把汗水变成芳香的墨汁，
    用劳动写上光辉的历史。
    这历史现出金色的大字，
    每一篇都是英雄的史诗，
    共产党是最伟大的作者，
    毛主席是领袖又是导师。
    这史诗有一部：“1958”，
    斗大的金字，缀满红花；
    总路线带来特大的跃进，
    六亿人迈开巨人的步伐。
    这史诗又写了：“1959”，
    斗大的金字，照耀宇宙；
    建设者攀上了新的高峰，
    越往前面看，越有奔头。
    我们有一颗创业的雄心，
    我们有一双擎天的巨手，
    要什么就能够创造什么，
    说这话绝不是乱夸海口。
    我们跟天斗，我们跟地斗，
    政治挂了帅，窍门处处有，
    工厂里每分钟都在超产，
    田地上每一季都在丰收。
    我们修起了更长的铁路，
    我们盖起了更高的大楼，
    我们谱出了更好的歌曲，
    我们酿造了更甜的美酒。
    唱着凯歌挥着万能的手，
    我们已把五十年代送走，
    趁着春暖花开，万紫千红，
    后进追赶先进正是时候！
    大家一心一意地跟着党，
    面前的道路越来越宽广，
    今年的头一炮已经打响，
    这史诗又写了新的一章！
