Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 22nd: U.S. Secretary of State Herter emphasized when testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 21st that the United States, while preparing to hold continuous East-West negotiations, needs to maintain its "strength" more than ever before.

He said that U.S. contact with the Soviet Union "provides an opportunity to further probe Soviet intentions." "This contact has become an important part of our continued policy of probing."

However, Herter emphasized: "During this period of probing and negotiation, it is more necessary than ever for us to maintain the strength of ourselves and our allies. We must not relax our vigilance."

Herter's remarks clearly expose the true face of the United States, which sings of peace and negotiation on the one hand, while continuing to adhere to the "policy of strength" on the other. Herter also emphasized the importance of the U.S.'s 1961 fiscal year "Mutual Security Program," which is a plan to coerce other countries to follow the U.S. in expanding armaments and preparing for war, and to carry out economic aggression against other countries. He said, "This plan is an extremely important and effective tool in promoting and maintaining our own interests throughout the world, and it is important to take affirmative action on these proposals so that it can be shown that the United States will continue to help maintain the military strength of the free world and continue to provide much-needed economic and technical assistance to the peoples of less developed countries, a belief I cannot overemphasize.

In his testimony, Herter also threatened that he felt "very uneasy" about the situation in Cuba. He described Cuban Prime Minister Castro's speech on the 20th, condemning foreign-instigated aggression against Cuba, as "the most insulting speech he (Castro) has ever made against the United States." He falsely accused Prime Minister Castro of insulting the American ambassador and the American government with "vicious language."

    赫脱强调在谈判期间更要保持“实力”
    再一次暴露美国的两面手法
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱21日在美国参议院外交委员会作证时强调美国在准备不断举行东西方谈判期间，比以前任何时候更有必要保持“实力”。
    他说，美国同苏联的接触“提供了进一步探测苏联的意图的机会”。“这种接触成了我们的继续进行探测的政策中的一个重要部分”。
    但是，赫脱强调说：“在这个探测和谈判期间，我们比以前任何时候更有必要保持我们以及我们盟国的实力。我们决不能放松警戒。”
    赫脱这番话清楚地暴露了美国一面高唱和平、谈判；一面继续坚持“实力政策”的真面目。赫脱还强调美国1961财政年度的“共同安全计划”，即胁迫其他国家追随美国扩军备战和对其他国家进行经济侵略的计划的重要性。他说，“这个计划是在促进和保持我们自己在全世界的利益方面的一个极为重要和有效的工具，就这些建议采取肯定的行动是很重要的，这样就可以表明，美国将继续帮助维持自由世界的军事实力，并继续向不大发达的国家的人民提供极需的经济和技术援助，我对这一点的信念不管怎样强调都不会过分。
    赫脱在作证中还扬言他对古巴的局势感到“很不安”。他把古巴卡斯特罗总理20日发表的谴责外国策动侵略古巴的演说，说成是“他（卡斯特罗）所发表的最为侮辱美国的一篇演说”。他反诬卡斯特罗总理以“恶毒的语言”侮辱了美国大使和美国政府。
