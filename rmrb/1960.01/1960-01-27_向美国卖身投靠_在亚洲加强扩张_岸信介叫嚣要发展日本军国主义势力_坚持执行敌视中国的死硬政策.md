Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 25th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's remarks at a press conference today demonstrate his intention to further rely on the United States, develop military strength, persist in hostility toward China and the Soviet Union, and intensify expansion in Asia.

In response to a reporter's question about how to strengthen Japan's armed forces, Kishi said: "Our basic policy is to gradually strengthen the 'Self-Defense Forces' in accordance with the nation's strength. We will proceed according to the current three-year plan and the second defense plan under study, based on the principle of gradual enhancement." The second military expansion plan Kishi mentioned stipulates that Japan's army, navy, and air force should all be equipped with missiles by 1965, with military spending doubling from current levels.

Even though Japanese militarism has already revived and the firepower of the Japanese army has already far surpassed pre-war levels, Nobusuke Kishi, filled with expansionist ambitions, claims that "Japan's strength is not particularly great compared to other countries in the world. Therefore, we must rely on treaties such as the Security Treaty and borrow the strength of the United States to defend Japan." Kishi attempts to conceal his sinful actions of concluding the Japan-U.S. military alliance and further developing military strength in this way. He also claims that in order to maintain a "balance of power" with the socialist camp, "Japan wants to obtain assistance from the United States in matters that it cannot do on its own."

Kishi also expressed his intention to maintain the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which harms the interests of the Japanese nation and Asian peace, for a long time. He said: "The stability of the treaty" is necessary, and although the situation may change, "it is inappropriate to stipulate clauses for re-examination from the beginning."

When discussing the area of application of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, Kishi said: "Regarding the scope of the Far East, the U.S. government has agreed to the content of the Japanese government's response to this issue in the Diet." Kishi is referring here to the response given by Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama in the Diet on this issue. At the time, Fujiyama said that the scope of the "Far East" mentioned in the new treaty "is the area around Japan, including the area north of the Philippines, the coast of China, and the Primorsky Krai (of the Soviet Union)." He also said that U.S. forces could be deployed to "the interior of China or the Soviet Union" and "could be deployed to areas outside the Far East."

In order to defend the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance, Kishi vigorously advocated a "position of strength" policy and maliciously slandered China and the Soviet Union. He claimed that China and the Soviet Union's condemnation of the righteous action of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries concluding the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance "is not calm." He also bluntly said: "I don't think we can ignore the practice of maintaining peace through a balance of power. The era in which true peace will exist even if military force is abandoned has not yet arrived." He even slandered the Soviet Union's sincerity in reducing its army by 1.2 million troops, saying that "reducing the number of personnel alone cannot be considered proof of disarmament."

When discussing Japan's relations with China, Kishi reiterated his intention to adhere to his policy of hostility toward China. He admitted: "We cannot close our eyes to the fact that the Communist Chinese regime has completed unification on the mainland and is carrying out economic construction." However, he then expressed his intention to deliberately obstruct the normalization of Japan-China relations. He said that before understanding the thoughts of Southeast Asian countries and the United Nations, and before completing the "adjustment work" with the Chiang Kai-shek group, "the work of recognizing Communist China and allowing it to join the United Nations cannot be done."

In his remarks today, Kishi also nakedly exposed the ambition of Japanese militarism to expand into Southeast Asia. A reporter asked that in order to "develop" underdeveloped countries, capital is needed first, and Southeast Asian countries are poor, with Japan having enough to bear just with compensation. The reporter asked Kishi what he thought of this issue.

Kishi said, "Japan does not need to be ashamed and think that it has no such capability at all." Kishi also expressed Japan's enthusiasm for establishing a so-called "Asian Community" and even a "Pacific Community," vainly attempting to dominate the Asian and Pacific regions. He said that "as far as Japan is concerned, it is concerned about both communities," and Japan is "the junction of these two regions."

When discussing the Japanese Diet's deliberation of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Kishi made it clear that he intends to force the Diet to ratify the treaty, regardless of the strong demands of the Japanese public. He said "It is my determination not to dissolve the Diet before approving the security treaty."

### 向美国卖身投靠　在亚洲加强扩张  岸信介叫嚣要发展日本军国主义势力  坚持执行敌视中国的死硬政策

    向美国卖身投靠　在亚洲加强扩张
    岸信介叫嚣要发展日本军国主义势力
    坚持执行敌视中国的死硬政策
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介今天在记者招待会上发表的谈话表明，他要进一步投靠美国，发展军事力量，坚持敌视中国和苏联，加强对亚洲进行扩张。
    岸信介在回答记者关于如何增强日本武装力量的问题时说：“我国的基本方针是按照国家力量逐渐增强‘自卫队’。要按照目前的三年计划和正在研究的第二次防御计划，根据逐渐增强的方针进行”。岸信介在这里所说的第二个扩军计划规定，日本的陆海空军都要在1965年以前，装备导弹，军费将比现在增加一倍。
    尽管日本军国主义已经复活，日本军队目前的火力已经大大超过战前，但是，充满扩张野心的岸信介却说什么“日本的力量比起世界各国并不是较大的。因此，要依靠安全条约等等条约，借美国的力量来保卫日本。”岸信介企图这样来掩饰他缔结日美军事同盟和进一步发展军事力量的罪恶行为。他还说什么为了同社会主义阵营保持“力量平衡”，“日本做不到的事情，想要得到美国的协助”。
    岸信介还表示要长期保持危害日本民族利益和亚洲和平的日美军事同盟条约。他说：“条约的稳定性”是必要的，虽然形势有可能变化，但是“最初就订出要重新研究的条款是不妥当的”。
    岸信介在谈到日美军事同盟条约的适用地区问题时说：“关于远东的范围问题，美国政府同意了日本政府在国会上就此作出的答复的内容”。岸信介在这里指的是日本外务相藤山爱一郎在国会中就这个问题作出的答复。当时，藤山说：新条约所说的“远东”的范围“是菲律宾以北、中国的沿岸、（苏联）滨海边区等日本周围地区。”他还说，美军可以出动到“中国的内地或苏联”，“可以出动到远东以外地区”。
    为了替侵略性日美军事同盟辩解，岸信介竭力鼓吹“实力地位”政策，并且恶意诬蔑中国和苏联。他说什么中国和苏联谴责美日反动派缔结侵略性日美军事同盟的正义行动“是不冷静的”。他还露骨地说：“我认为不能无视用力量均衡来保持和平的这种做法。放弃了武力也会有真正和平的时代还没有到来。”他甚至还诽谤苏联裁减一百二十万军队的和平诚意，说什么“不能认为只是裁减人数就证实了裁军”。
    谈到日本同中国的关系问题时，岸信介再次表示要坚持他的敌视中国的政策。他承认：“不能闭上眼睛不看这样一个事实，共产党中国政权在大陆完成了统一，并且正在进行经济建设。”可是，他接着就表示了蓄意阻挠日中关系正常化的立场。他说，在没有了解东南亚国家和联合国各国的想法以前，在还没有结束同蒋介石集团的“调整工作”以前，“是不能承认共产党中国和让它加入联合国的工作的”。
    岸信介在今天的谈话中还赤裸裸地暴露了日本军国主义向东南亚扩张的野心。有记者问道，要想“开发”不发达国家，首先就需要资金，东南亚国家贫穷，日本单是赔偿就够受了。记者问岸信介怎样看这个问题。
    岸信介说，“日本不必自卑地认为完全没有这种能力。”岸信介还表示日本热衷于建立所谓“亚洲共同体”以至“太平洋共同体”，妄图称霸亚洲和太平洋地区。他说什么：“就日本来说，对两个共同体都表示关心”，日本是“这两个地区的接合点”。
    谈到日本国会审议新日美“安全条约”问题时，岸信介表明，他不顾日本公众的强烈要求，企图强使国会批准这项条约。他说“在批准安全条约以前不解散国会，这是我的决心”。
