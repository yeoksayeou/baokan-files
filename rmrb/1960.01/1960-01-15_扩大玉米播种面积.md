    Expand Corn Planting Area
    Vigorously developing feed production, establishing feed bases, and fully supplying various concentrated and rough feeds are the material foundation for the high-speed development of animal husbandry production centered on pig raising.
    Our country has very rich wild plants that can be used as feed, and there are also many crops that can be used as feed. Corn is a very good feed crop, and it is reasonable to say that "corn is the king of feed." First, corn is a high-yield crop. The yield per unit area of corn is only second to rice and sweet potatoes, ranking third. Generally, each mu can harvest three to four hundred catties. If there is sufficient water and fertilizer and careful management, the yield of corn will be greatly increased. The Kuixingzhuang Production Team of Wangqiansi Commune in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, which is famous throughout the country for pig raising, harvested 2,219 catties of corn from 1.2 mu of cornfield in 1959. Calculating one hundred catties of concentrated feed per pig, this 1.2 mu of cornfield can raise twenty-two pigs. If high-density planting is implemented and harvested as green fodder during the waxy maturity period, each mu can harvest more than 10,000 catties. In 1959, Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, suffered a severe drought that had not occurred in more than 20 years, but the yield per mu of more than 27,000 mu of corn still reached more than 800 catties, of which more than 12,000 mu even reached more than 1,200 catties (see today's newspaper). Therefore, appropriately expanding the planting area of corn and comprehensively improving the yield per unit area of corn can not only greatly increase the total national grain output, but also further solve the feed problem for the development of animal husbandry.
    Second, the entire corn crop is a treasure and can be used as feed. Corn kernels can be used as concentrated feed, corn leaves and corn tips can be used to feed livestock; corn stalks and corn cobs can be used to feed pigs after processing and crushing; corn stalks after silage are even the best feed for livestock. Fengrun County, Hebei Province, has calculated that according to the county's current average corn yield per mu, one mu of corn can supply roughage for six to ten pigs, and the by-products of each mu of corn are enough to fatten one pig.
    Third, corn has strong adaptability. It can be planted and grows well in the north, south, plains, and high mountain areas, as well as in sandy soil, yellow mud, or other soil types. At the same time, the corn planting season is long. It can be planted from spring to autumn. In some areas, two or three crops can be planted. The first crop is harvested for kernels as food for people and concentrated feed for livestock, and the second crop can be harvested for green fodder. In spring wheat areas in Northeast and Northwest China, a crop of corn can be rushed to plant after the spring wheat harvest as green fodder. In high-altitude pastoral areas with short frost-free periods, corn can also be planted in large quantities as green fodder.
    Corn is not only high in yield, but also high in nutritional value. It is rich in crude protein, crude fat, carbohydrates, and other nutrients. Compared with other coarse grains, one hundred catties of corn has the nutritional equivalent of one hundred and thirty-five catties of oats, or one hundred and thirty catties of barley, or one hundred and twenty catties of sorghum. Therefore, corn is not only a very good feed, but also an indispensable food for our lives. Whether it is for grain production and animal husbandry production, or for the food requirements of people and the feed requirements of livestock, corn should be elevated to the status of a staple food, and corn production should be greatly developed. According to the new situation of agricultural and animal husbandry development, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China plans to plant 8 million mu of corn this year, an increase of 76% over last year. This approach is completely correct. It is hoped that all localities will appropriately expand the corn planting area when arranging the planting area of crops in 1960.

### 扩大玉米播种面积

    扩大玉米播种面积
    大搞饲料生产，建立饲料基地，充分供应各种精粗饲料，是高速度发展以养猪为中心的畜牧业生产的物质基础。
    我国可作饲料的野生植物是十分丰富的，可作饲料的农作物也是很多的。玉米就是一种很好的饲料作物，人称“玉米是饲料之王”是有道理的。第一，玉米是高产作物。玉米的单位面积产量，仅次于水稻、红薯，而居第三位。一般每亩可收三、四百斤。如果水肥充足，精心管理，玉米的产量更会大大提高。以养猪闻名全国的河北吴桥县王谦寺公社魁星庄生产队，1959年一亩二分玉米地收获了二千二百一十九斤玉米。以一头猪喂一百斤精饲料计算，这一亩二分玉米地即可养二十二头猪。如果实行高度密植，在腊熟期收作青饲料，每亩可收一万多斤。1959年四川武胜县遭到二十多年未有过的大旱，二万七千多亩玉米亩产量仍达八百多斤，其中一万二千多亩更高达一千二百斤以上（见今日本报）。因此，适当扩大玉米的种植面积，全面提高玉米的单位面积产量，既可以使全国粮食总产量大大增加，又可以进一步解决发展畜牧业的饲料问题。
    第二，玉米作物全身都是宝，都可用作饲料。玉米子实可作精饲料，玉米叶、玉米尖可以喂牲口；玉米秸、玉米轴经过加工粉碎，可以用来喂猪；玉米的秸秆青贮以后，更是牲畜最好的饲料。河北丰润县计算过，按目前这个县玉米的平均亩产量计算，一亩玉米可以供应六头至十头猪的粗饲料，每亩玉米的副产品，又足够喂肥一头猪。
    第三，玉米的适应性强，不论北方、南方、平原、高山地区，又不论沙土、黄泥或其他土质，都能种植，并且生长良好。同时，玉米的播种季节长，从春天到秋天都可种植，有些地区还可以种两作、三季，前季收子实作人的粮食和牲口的精饲料，后季可收青饲料。在东北、西北春小麦地区，春麦收获后可以抢种一茬玉米作青饲料。在无霜期短的高寒牧区，也可以大量种植玉米作青饲料。
    玉米不仅产量高，营养价值也很高，粗蛋白质、粗脂肪、碳水化合物等含量都比较丰富。同其他杂粮比起来，一百斤玉米的营养成分相当于一百三十五斤燕麦，或一百三十斤大麦，或一百二十斤高粱。因此玉米不仅是一种很好的饲料，也是我们生活中不可缺少的一种食粮。无论就粮食生产和畜牧业生产来说，无论就人的粮食和牲畜的饲料要求来说，都应该把玉米提升到主粮的地位，让玉米生产来个大大的发展。中共天津市委根据农牧业发展的新形势，今年计划种玉米八百万亩，比去年扩大76％，这种作法是完全正确的。希望各地在安排1960年农作物种植面积时，都能适当地扩大玉米的播种面积。
