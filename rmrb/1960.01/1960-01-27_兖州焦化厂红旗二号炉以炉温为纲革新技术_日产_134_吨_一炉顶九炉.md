Yanzhou Coking Plant's Red Flag No. 2 Furnace Employs Temperature-Based Technological Innovation
    Daily Output of 134 Tons – One Furnace Equals Nine
    Coking

    According to a report in the *Dazhong Daily*, the workers of the Red Flag No. 2 experimental furnace at the Yanzhou Coking Plant in Shandong Province, through hard work and ingenuity, have created a complete set of experiences for increasing the production of the Red Flag No. 2 furnace. In early January, the furnace produced a total of 1,340 tons of coke, with an average daily output of 134 tons and a maximum daily output of 154 tons, which is nine to ten times its original designed production capacity of 15 tons per day. The quality of the coke is good, with an average sulfur content of 0.57%, an ash content of 12.7%, an average coking rate of over 80%, a coking time of four hours, and a labor consumption of 0.42 workers per ton of coke. The oil yield reached 3%; the cost per ton of coke was 32.4 yuan. This furnace has become a model for high yield, high quality, low cost, and safety in coke ovens throughout Shandong Province.

    The factory's leading cadres and workers closely combined their efforts and concluded that to achieve high output from the Red Flag No. 2 furnace, it is necessary to focus on furnace temperature and ensure the normal temperature of the furnace. In this regard, they have mastered the following three key aspects: First, when firing, master the central aspects of fire regulation, stoking, and cleaning to ensure that the entire furnace achieves high temperature (1100 to 1150 degrees) and uniform temperature; second, shorten the coking time as much as possible to reduce furnace temperature loss; third, load the furnace quickly and preheat the coal to prevent the furnace temperature from dropping.

    To ensure that the above technical requirements are met, the factory Party committee mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovations centered on transforming manual operations into mechanical operations, reducing physical labor, and improving production efficiency. To increase the charging speed, workers made their own wheeled carts and laid earth and iron tracks on the furnace, achieving the mechanization of raw material transportation and loading, which greatly improved work efficiency. To shorten the coking time, workers successively created homemade mechanical devices such as sheet-metal caps, opening and closing devices, and coke raking frames. To facilitate the operation of the coke raking workers, the employees of the repair shop made a sheet-metal heat insulation baffle, which facilitated the workers' operation in front of the furnace, shortened the coking time, and reduced the cold air entering the furnace. At the same time, a drying bed was built to preheat the furnace charge, which also created favorable conditions for increasing the furnace temperature. Other technical equipment was also improved. In the past, the coal gas suction pipes were often blocked and had to be shut down and cleaned every three days, which directly affected the furnace temperature and output. The factory Party committee secretary convened workshop directors, workers, and technicians to jointly study the problem and changed the original elbow-type gas and tar downcomer pipes to three-way water-sealed downcomer pipes, solving the problem of frequent blockage of the gas suction pipes. The cleaning interval was extended from once every three days to once every ninety days, thereby ensuring the furnace temperature and increasing the output.

    After learning from this experience, eight of the twenty-nine Red Flag No. 2 furnaces in the Jining area have already exceeded the 100-ton mark in daily output. In order to enable this experience to blossom and bear fruit throughout the province, the Shandong Provincial Metallurgical Bureau held an on-site meeting in Yanzhou in early January.

    兖州焦化厂红旗二号炉以炉温为纲革新技术
    日产134吨　一炉顶九炉
    炼焦
    据大众日报消息　山东省兖州焦化厂红旗二号试验炉职工苦干巧干，创造了一整套提高红旗二号炉生产的经验。1月上旬，该炉共产焦一千三百四十吨，平均日产一百三十四吨，最高日产量达一百五十四吨，为原设计生产能力日产十五吨的九至十倍。焦炭质量良好，平均含硫分0．57％，含灰分12．7％，平均结焦率达80％以上，结焦时间为四小时，每吨焦用工零点四二个；出油率达3％；每吨焦成本为三十二点四元。这座炉成了山东全省焦炉高产、优质、低成本、安全的标兵。
    这个厂领导干部和工人密切结合，总结出要想使红旗二号炉高产，必须以炉温为纲，保证炉子的正常温度。在这方面，他们掌握了以下三个环节：一，在烧火时，掌握好调火、烧灶、清扫等几个中心环节，使全炉做到高温（一千一百至一千一百五十度）、温度均匀；二，出焦时要尽量缩短时间，以减少炉温损失；三，装炉时要快，并要实行煤料预热，以免炉温降低。
    为了保证达到上述技术要求，厂党委发动群众以变手工操作为机械操作，减轻体力劳动，提高生产效率为中心，大闹技术革新。为了提高装料速度，工人们自制了轱辘马，在炉上铺筑了土铁轨道，实现了运装原料土机械化，大大提高了工作效率。为了缩短出焦时间，工人们先后创造了白铁帽、开闭器、扒焦架等土机械；为了便利扒焦工人的操作，修配车间的职工用白铁做成了扒焦隔温挡板，便利了工人在炉前操作，缩短了出焦时间，减少了侵入炉内的冷空气。同时，修建了干燥炕对炉料进行预热，也为提高炉温创造了有利条件。其它技术设备也作了改进。吸煤气管道过去经常堵塞，三天就得停车清理一次，直接影响着炉温和产量的提高。厂党委书记便召集车间主任、工人、技术员共同研究，将原来的弯头式煤气、焦油下降管道，改为三通水封式下降管道，解决了吸煤气管经常堵塞的问题，由三天清理一次延长到九十多天才清理一次，从而保证了炉温，提高了产量。
    济宁地区的二十九座红旗二号炉学习这个经验以后，有八座的日产水平已经突破了百吨大关。为了使这一经验在全省开花结果，山东省冶金局1月上旬在兖州召开了全省范围的现场会。
