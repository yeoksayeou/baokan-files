Advanced Regions Increase Hog Raising
Backward Regions Strive to Catch Up
Changyuan County Party Committee Deeply Leads the Hog Raising and Manure Accumulation Movement

(Reported by this newspaper) The Changyuan County Party Committee in Henan Province adopted measures to vigorously promote the advanced and focus on the backward, promoting the overall development of the hog raising industry.

The hog raising and manure accumulation movement in Changyuan County achieved great results. By mid-December 1959, the number of hogs in the county had increased to over 90,000, 2.6 times the number at the end of June. In order to promote the in-depth and comprehensive development of the movement, the County Party Committee formed a hog raising work inspection team in late November and conducted an inspection throughout the county. The inspection revealed that the development of the hog raising and manure accumulation movement was very uneven. The eight most advanced brigades had achieved one hog per mu of land or one hog per person, while 24 brigades had only one hog for every 50 mu of land or more. In terms of the thinking of cadres and the masses, the vast majority had sufficient confidence and great enthusiasm for large-scale hog raising and manure accumulation, but some problems also existed: in advanced areas, complacency began to grow, and the work of continuing to develop hog raising was not tightly grasped. In backward areas, some cadres and the masses lacked confidence in striving to achieve one hog per mu of land. The County Party Committee carefully studied and analyzed the above situation and believed that: on the one hand, cadres in advanced hog raising areas should be educated to overcome complacency, make persistent efforts, and continue to leap forward; on the other hand, leadership should be strengthened in backward areas, helping to solve specific difficulties, breaking through weak links, and promoting comprehensive and large-scale development.

Therefore, in advanced areas, in conjunction with rural socialist education and ten-year perspective education, the important significance of hog raising and manure accumulation for increasing production was further publicized, and cadre meetings and mass meetings were held in a timely manner to widely discuss "Whether advanced hog raising areas still need to develop? What role should they play in the overall development of hog raising in the county?" This broke the complacency of some people and established the collectivist thinking of continuing the leap forward in hog raising and actively supporting areas with poor foundations. On the basis of ideological improvement, the communes and brigades vigorously promoted winter mating and high sow yields, and comprehensively launched a "four comparisons" movement: "compare full sow pregnancies, compare more reproduction, compare full survival of piglets, and compare fast development."

For areas with a poor foundation, the first task was to establish confidence in the large-scale development of hog raising. The County Party Committee organized cadres and the masses in these areas to conduct in-depth discussions on issues such as "Can hog raising production leap forward? How can we strive for a leap forward? Is there a way to solve the problem of winter feed?" During the discussion process, cadres and members of advanced areas were also organized to give roving reports in these areas, talking about the benefits of hog raising and manure accumulation for agricultural production increase, supporting national construction, and increasing commune and member income. They introduced hog raising and manure accumulation experience and used lively examples to illustrate the principles of self-reliance, self-propagation, and large-scale hog raising, greatly encouraging and stimulating the hog raising confidence of cadres and the masses in areas with a relatively poor foundation.

While solving the ideological problems of cadres and members, the County Party Committee also paid special attention to solving the practical difficulties in areas with a poor foundation. The methods were: (1) In terms of hog raising technology, in addition to transferring 120 breeders from areas with a poor foundation for centralized training, the County Party Committee also selected 240 hog raising experts from advanced areas to help teams with a poor foundation to process feed, conduct mating, and pass on feeding management experience through the method of master-apprentice teaching, cultivating 3,700 technicians in half a month. The Zhouying Brigade of Fangli Commune originally did not have a single technician, and some sows were not pregnant. Since a skilled technician was transferred, measures such as artificial estrus were taken to quickly mate the sows. (2) Strengthen guidance on the collection and processing of coarse feed. In areas with a poor foundation, key points were selected, samples were collected, and exhibitions were organized. A total of 250 pig feed exhibition rooms were set up, displaying various samples, and organizing the masses, especially women, children, and semi-laborers, to visit, helping them identify coarse feed types, and greatly strengthening the team collecting pig feed. For example, Changcun Commune was originally not accustomed to using coarse feed to raise pigs, and many crop stalks and leaves were not collected and stored. Now, 5 million catties have been collected. (3) In terms of solving the problem of breeding pigs and pig sources, in addition to the county's planned allocation of a portion, each commune organized the transfer of breeding pigs and sows between teams based on the principle of equal value exchange. The county transferred a total of 300 boars and 2,900 sows from advanced areas to areas with a poor foundation, and established 36 mating stations in communes and teams with few breeding pigs. (4) The County Party Committee appointed two secretaries and three members to be responsible for these areas with a poor foundation, and assigned 150 cadres to be stationed in the teams to help the team cadres do a good job in hog raising. (5) In order to prevent the spread of hog cholera, the County Party Committee also organized 134 veterinarians to go to areas with a poor foundation to teach technology, train epidemic prevention personnel, and help do a good job in wintering the pigs.

The above measures have created favorable conditions for the balanced development of the hog raising and manure accumulation movement.

    先进地区　养猪加码
    后进地区　奋起追赶
    长垣县委深入领导养猪积肥运动
    本报讯　河南省长垣县委采取了大抓先进，狠抓后进的措施，促进了养猪事业的全面大发展。
    长垣县养猪积肥运动，获得很大成绩，到1959年12月中，全县的猪已增加到九万多头，比6月底增加一点六倍。为推动运动深入全面的发展，县委在11月下旬组成养猪工作检查团，在全县范围内进行了一次检查。检查中发现养猪积肥运动发展很不平衡，最先进的八个大队已实现了一亩地一头猪或一人一头猪，而五十亩地以上才合一头猪的还有二十四个大队。在干部和群众思想上，绝大部分人对大搞养猪积肥信心足、劲头大，但也存在一些问题：在先进地区，开始滋长着自满情绪，对继续发展养猪工作抓的不紧。在后进地区，部分干部、群众对争取实现一亩地一头猪信心不足。县委认真研究分析了以上情况认为：一方面，教育养猪先进地区干部，克服自满情绪，再接再厉，持续跃进；另一方面，加强对后进地区的领导，帮助解决具体困难，突破薄弱环节，促进全面大发展。
    因此，在先进地区，结合农村社会主义教育和十年远景教育，进一步宣传了养猪积肥对增产的重要意义，并及时召开了干部会、群众会，广泛讨论了“养猪先进地区是不是还需要发展？在全县养猪大发展中应当起什么作用？”打破了某些人的自满情绪，树立了养猪继续跃进和积极支援基础差的地区的集体主义思想。在思想提高的基础上，各社队大抓冬季配种和母猪高产，全面开展了“比母猪满怀，比繁殖多，比仔猪全成活，比发展快”的“四比”运动。
    对基础差的地区，首先是树立养猪大发展的信心。县委组织这些地区的干部、群众，深入讨论“养猪生产能不能跃进？怎样争取跃进？冬季饲料有没有办法解决？”等问题；在讨论过程中，并组织先进地区的干部、社员到这些地区作巡回报告，大讲养猪积肥对农业增产、支援国家建设、增加公社和社员收入等方面的好处，介绍养猪积肥经验，用活人活事说明自力更生、自繁自养、养猪大发展的道理，大大鼓舞与激发了基础较差的地区的干部、群众的养猪信心。
    在解决干部、社员思想问题的同时，县委还特别重视解决基础较差地区的实际困难。办法是：（1）在养猪技术方面，县委除在基础较差地区抽调一百二十名饲养员集中培训外，又从先进地区选拔养猪能手二百四十人，用以师带徒、实作实学的办法，帮助基础较差的队加工饲料、搞配种、传授饲养管理经验，半月中培养了三千七百名技术员。方里公社周营大队，原来没有一个技术员，有些母猪空怀。自从调去一个技术能手以后，采取人工催情等办法，使母猪迅速配上了种。（2）加强对粗饲料的采集和加工工作的指导。在基础较差的地区，选择重点、采集标本、组织展览，共办猪饲料展览室二百五十个，展出多种样品，组织广大群众特别是妇女、儿童、半劳力参观，帮助他们识别粗饲料种类，大大加强了采集猪饲料的队伍。如常村公社原来对粗饲料养猪不习惯，很多农作物梗、叶没集存起来，现已收集五百万斤。（3）在解决种猪和猪源方面，除县有计划调剂一部分外，各公社都本着等价交换的原则，组织队与队之间的种猪和母猪的调剂。全县共从先进地区调剂到基础较差地区种公猪三百头、母猪二千九百头，并在种猪少的社、队建立三十六个配种站。（4）县委确定两个书记、三个委员，分管这些基础较差的地区，并确定一百五十个干部驻队，帮助队干部作好养猪工作。（5）为防止猪瘟流行，县委还组织兽医一百三十四人，到基础较差的地区传授技术、训练防疫人员，帮助作好猪只过冬工作。
    由于采取以上措施为养猪积肥运动平衡发展创造了有利条件。
