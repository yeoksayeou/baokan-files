    Make Preparations Early
    Dīng Shān
    "A good start is half the battle," this is a summary of the masses' experience in life and struggle, and also one of the Party's methods of leadership.
    As early as the revolutionary war period, Chairman Mao told us not to fight unprepared battles. In the construction period, the Party asks us to be good at seizing time, making early preparations, and striving for initiative, so that we can achieve victory. This means that "early" is the premise of achieving good results. Only by grasping the early stage can we ensure that things are done well.
    Agricultural production has a strong seasonality. The masses say, "Planting in spring is a matter of a day, planting in summer is a matter of an hour." The quality of crop harvest is greatly related to "not violating the farming season." Therefore, leading agricultural production requires particularly early action – mobilizing the masses early, deliberating early, formulating plans early, and making good preparations in all aspects early. At present, winter production is in its final tense stage, and the spring sowing season is approaching. On the basis of the great achievements already made in winter production, how to make early preparations for spring plowing and sowing, and ensure that spring crops are planted in large quantities, well, and in a timely manner, is of decisive significance for winning a greater bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.
    February 5th is the Beginning of Spring. When this solar term arrives, the southern regions will start transplanting early rice and sowing spring miscellaneous grains, and the spring sowing work in the northern regions will not be far off. Now there are only ten days or so left until the Beginning of Spring. How are the preparations going? Has the spring sowing plan been formulated? Has it been submitted to the masses for discussion? How is the work of accumulating and transporting fertilizer progressing? Have the farm tools been repaired? Have sufficient good seeds been prepared? ...A comprehensive and in-depth inspection should be carried out as soon as possible, and the preparatory work for spring plowing should be done early. This is a prerequisite for ensuring timely sowing and planting more and better.
    The reason why leading agricultural production requires special emphasis on grasping the early stage is also because the workload of any agricultural task is very large. If preparations are not made early and a crash effort is made only when the time comes, it will delay the farming season, reduce quality, and even fail to complete the production plan. Taking spring plowing and sowing as an example, the national spring sowing area accounts for more than one-half of the total cultivated area, that is, about one billion mu. If calculated based on 80 dan of base fertilizer and 20 jin of seeds per mu, a total of 80 billion dan of fertilizer and 20 billion jin of seeds need to be accumulated and transported during spring sowing. How much labor should be used for these two agricultural tasks alone? At the same time, the spring sowing work is more than just preparing fertilizer and seeds! Plowing, harrowing, diverting water for irrigation... Many things should be done, and these things all require a large amount of labor. From this point of view, how can timely sowing be guaranteed without early preparation?
    Although the seasonality of agricultural production is strong and the workload is large, the regularity of agricultural production is relatively easy to grasp, which makes it easier for us to make early preparations. From a large seasonal perspective, spring sowing, summer weeding, autumn harvest, and winter plowing are known to everyone. As for what agricultural tasks should be done in each solar term, and what agricultural tasks are most suitable to do in which solar term, the masses and cadres also have experience. The problem is that the current cultivation level has improved, and any agricultural task is more detailed and scientific than in the era of small-scale farming, which greatly increases the amount of labor. If not handled well, it will often cause passivity and delay the farming season. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize the issue of early preparation.
    Early embodies the revolutionary spirit of exerting full effort and striving for the upstream. Only by grasping the early stage can we make the spring plowing work more, faster, better, and more economical, and can we achieve a greater and more comprehensive bumper harvest in this year's agricultural production!

    早和好

    “一早百早，一好百好”，这是群众生活斗争经验的总结，也是党的领导方法之一。
    早在革命战争时期，毛主席就告诉我们不打无准备的仗。在建设时期，党要我们善于抓紧时间，早作准备，争取主动，就能取得胜利。这就是说，“早”是实现好的前提，只有抓住了早，才能保证做得好。
    农业生产有强烈的季节性，群众说“春种一日，夏种一时”，农作物收成的好坏，与“不违农时”有极大关系。因此，领导农业生产尤其需要抓得早——早发动群众，早酝酿，早订计划，早作好各方面的准备工作。现在，冬季生产正处在最后的紧张阶段，而春播季节又将来到。如何在冬季生产已经取得伟大成就的基础上，提早做好春耕播种的准备工作，保证春播作物种得多、种得好、种得适时，对夺取今年农业生产更大丰收有决定性的意义。
    2月5日是立春，到了这个节令，南方地区就要开始插早稻和播种春杂粮，北方地区的春播工作也为期不远了。现在离立春还有十几天，准备工作究竟做得怎样了？春播计划订出来了没有？交给群众讨论了吗？积肥运肥工作做得怎样？农具整修了没有？良种备足了吗？……应该及早地进行一次全面深入的检查，把备耕工作提早做好，这是保证适时播种和多种、种好的先决条件。
    领导农业生产所以要特别强调抓得早，还因为任何一项农活的工作量都非常大，如果不提早做好准备，事到临时才突击，那就会耽误农时，降低质量，甚至不能完成生产计划。以春耕播种为例，全国春播地约占总耕地面积二分之一以上，即十亿亩左右，如果按每亩地上底肥八十担、播种子二十斤计算，春播时共需积肥运肥八百亿担、选种二百亿斤，光是这两项农活就该用多少工？同时，春播工作又何止是准备肥料和种子两项农活啊！耕地、耙地、引水灌溉……许许多多的事都是应该做的，而这些事情都需要用大量的劳动力。由此看来，不早做准备，又怎能保证适时播种呢？
    农业生产的季节性虽然强，工作量虽然大，但是农业生产的规律性却是比较容易掌握的，这就便于我们提早做好准备。从大的季节来说，春播、夏耘、秋收、冬耕，这是每一个人都知道的。至于每一个节令该做什么农活，什么农活在什么节令做最合适，群众和干部也是有经验的。问题是现在的耕作水平提高了，任何一项农活都比小农经济时代更细致、更科学了，这就大大地增加了劳动量，如果掌握不好，往往会造成被动，耽误农时。因此，有必要把早准备的问题特别强调一下。
    早，体现着鼓足干劲、力争上游的革命精神。只有抓住了早，才能使春耕工作做得又多又快又好又省，才能使今年的农业生产获得更大更全面的丰收！
