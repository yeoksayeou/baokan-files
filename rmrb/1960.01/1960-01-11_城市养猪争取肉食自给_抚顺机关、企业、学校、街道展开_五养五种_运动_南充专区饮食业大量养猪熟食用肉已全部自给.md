This newspaper reports: Fushun City’s organs, enterprises, schools, troops, and street residents are vigorously engaged in raising pigs, chickens, ducks, and rabbits. By the end of 1959, the city's factories, mines, organs, schools, etc., had established more than 370 breeding farms (self-sufficient non-staple food production pig farms), raising more than 18,300 pigs, an increase of more than eleven times compared with 1958; raising more than 545,000 chickens, an increase of more than sixteen times compared with 1958; the number of chickens, goats, rabbits, etc., has also increased exponentially. Fifty-eight units have begun to allow each person to eat one jin of meat during various festivals and half a jin of meat per month at ordinary times, starting from the beginning of 1960. These farms have also planted more than 42,000 mu of vegetables and fodder.

Fushun City is an industrial city with a population of one million. In the past, more than 90% of the city's supply of non-staple foods relied on support from other places. The Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China implemented the Party's instruction on "grasping production with one hand and life with the other." At the end of 1958, it discussed the city's non-staple food production and supply issues and decided to launch a mass "Five Raisings and Five Plantings" movement in the city (Five Raisings refers to raising poultry, pigs, goats, fish, and rabbits; Five Plantings refers to planting grains, alfalfa, vegetables, beans, and melons) in order to solve the city's non-staple food supply problem as soon as possible.

In order to quickly create a mass non-staple food production movement, under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women's federations, and other organizations have all made non-staple food production an important task. The trade unions regarded the "Five Raisings and Five Plantings" movement as a main content of grasping ideology, production, and life. They exchanged experiences and organized visits and studies through on-site meetings and life exhibitions, thereby promoting the in-depth development of the "Five Raisings and Five Plantings" movement in factories and mines. The Women's Federation, in coordination with the District People's Committee, successively held meetings of women cadres and street cadres, organizing women who could not leave their housework to collectively or individually raise poultry. Therefore, the "Five Raisings and Five Plantings" movement in the streets has also been widely carried out. Street residents in the city raised a total of more than 800 pigs and more than 160,000 poultry.

After the mass movement of self-sufficient non-staple food production in organs, schools, troops, and other units was launched, they encountered difficulties such as seeds, feed, epidemic prevention, and feeding management. Therefore, they vigorously promoted the spirit of cooperation, and various departments supported each other. Suburban communes allocated more than 30,000 mu of land as production bases for the city's "Five Raisings and Five Plantings." In order to solve the difficulty of seeds, suburban communes actively carried out the "more mating and dense breeding" movement, and successively supported the city with more than 8,000 sows, breeding pigs, and piglets.

In the "Five Raisings and Five Plantings" movement, all units, in the spirit of starting from scratch and self-reliance, closely combined with the movement to increase production and practice economy, tapped all material and human potential and waste materials to build farms; organized the elderly, weak, retired personnel and family members, as well as seasonal workers, to work on the "Five Raisings and Five Plantings" farms. Many units mobilized employees to make their own adobe bricks, burn bricks, collect waste materials, and build livestock and poultry houses. Teachers and students of Fushun No. 6 Middle School vigorously engaged in work-study programs, and built more than 30 chicken and rabbit houses within only ten days without asking the state for a single penny.

Currently, factories, mines, organs, schools, and street residents in Fushun City are actively making preparations to implement the central government's policy of simultaneously developing urban and rural areas and vigorously developing non-staple food production. All farms are protecting their broodstock and breeding eggs, breeding and raising themselves; they are also preparing to make full use of barren mountains and wasteland to establish feed bases and strive for greater development of livestock, poultry, and eggs.

This newspaper reports: Employees in the food service industry in Nanchong Prefecture, Sichuan Province, combined with their business, started from production, and actively developed pig raising. As of December 20, 1959, the food service industry in the entire region had raised 14,376 pigs. Calculated based on the more than 6,000 employees in the food service industry, the average number of pigs raised per person is 3.41; the average number of pigs raised per shop in the 1,248 restaurants in the region is 10.4. Due to the large-scale development of pig raising in the food service industry, restaurants throughout the region have achieved complete self-sufficiency in cooked meat for consumption since October of last year; 117 shops have not only achieved self-sufficiency in meat but have also transferred more than 2,800 fat pigs to supply towns, cities, and mining areas.

The Nanchong Prefecture food service industry has mainly achieved the following experiences in developing pig raising:

First, strengthen the Party's leadership. In the beginning, some employees did not approve of the food service industry raising pigs, and some said that "there are too few people to take care of them," etc. Therefore, the leaders of relevant departments calculated three accounts for the food service industry employees: calculate the political account, so that employees clearly understand the great significance of the food service industry raising pigs in supporting national construction and supplying the market; calculate the economic account, clearly understand the role of the food service industry raising pigs in increasing social material wealth and increasing capital accumulation; calculate the potential account, clarify that there are many favorable conditions for the food service industry to raise pigs, thus setting off a pig-raising climax in the entire food service industry.

Second, in accordance with the spirit of diligence and thrift in running all undertakings, make the best of conditions and adopt "poor" methods to build pigsties, so as to spend less or no money and do more things. Sixty employees from five restaurants in Dongguan Town, Nanchong County, automatically contributed wooden boards and stone slabs when they lacked raw materials. After seven nights of hard work, they finally built two small pig farms that could raise more than 100 pigs without buying materials, hiring workers, or spending funds.

Third, promote large-scale cooperation between commerce and agriculture to solve the problem of pig sources. After the comprehensive development of pig raising in the food service industry, pig sources were very scarce. In order to solve this problem, they adopted the following three methods: restaurants supported the people's communes with the fertilizer accumulated in the breeding farms, and the people's communes helped the food service industry solve the problem of pig sources; self-breeding and self-raising, supporting commercial departments with large fat pigs that meet export standards, and exchanging them for feeder pigs.

Fourth, solve the feed problem from various aspects. Fully utilize the by-products of the food service industry, and use all the leftover soup, swill, leftovers, and bean dregs from the food service industry to feed pigs, which can solve more than half of the feed needed for 20,000 pigs, and the effect is even better than grain; mobilize employees to use their spare time to develop open spaces in front of and behind houses and plots of land along fields to grow feed. The food service industry in the entire region has now planted more than 750 mu of feed.

Fifth, combine professional labor with voluntary labor. Mobilize employees to offer suggestions and suggestions, vigorously reform a batch of cooking tools, reduce labor intensity, improve labor efficiency, and save labor. On this basis, general restaurants have all extracted full-time employees to take charge of pig breeding work, and at the same time mobilized employees to take some time to participate in voluntary labor in rotation.

    城市养猪争取肉食自给
    抚顺机关、企业、学校、街道展开“五养五种”运动
    南充专区饮食业大量养猪熟食用肉已全部自给
    本报讯　抚顺市机关、企业、学校、部队、街道居民大搞猪、鸡、鸭、兔的饲养。到1959年年底，全市厂矿、机关、学校等共办了三百七十多个饲养场（自给性副食品生产养猪场），养猪一万八千三百多头，比1958年增长十一倍多；养鸡五十四万五千多只，比1958年增加十六倍多；鸡、羊、兔等也成倍增长。有五十八个单位从1960年初开始，每个人在各个节日可以吃一斤肉，平时每月可以吃半斤肉。这些农场还种植了蔬菜、饲料四万二千多亩。
    抚顺市是一个百万人口的工业城市，过去城市副食品的供应90％以上都是靠外地支援。中共抚顺市委贯彻执行了党的关于“一手抓生产，一手抓生活”的指示，在1958年年底对全市副食品生产和供应问题进行了讨论，决定在城市开展群众性的“五养五种”运动（五养是养禽、猪、羊、鱼、兔；五种是种粮食、苜蓿、蔬菜、豆类、瓜类），以便尽快地解决全市副食品供应问题。
    为了迅速造成一个群众性的副食品大生产运动，在市委的统一领导下，工会、共青团、妇联等组织都把副食品生产做为一项重要工作抓了起来。工会把“五养五种”运动作为抓思想、抓生产、抓生活的一项主要内容，通过现场会议和生活展览会，交流了经验，组织了参观学习，从而促进了厂矿、企业“五养五种”运动的深入开展。妇联配合市区人民委员会先后召开了妇女干部会议和街道干部会议，组织不能离开家务的妇女，集体或个体饲养家禽，因此街道的“五养五种”运动也普遍开展起来，全市街道居民共养猪八百多头，养禽十六万多只。
    机关、学校、部队等单位的自给性副食品生产群众运动开展起来以后，又遇到了种源、饲料、防疫、饲养管理等困难，于是就大兴协作之风，各部门互相支援。郊区公社拨出了三万多亩土地，作为城市“五养五种”的生产基地。为了解决种源困难，郊区公社又积极开展了“多配密繁”运动，先后支援城市母猪、种猪、仔猪八千多头。
    在“五养五种”运动中，各单位都是本着白手起家、自力更生的精神，密切结合增产节约运动，挖掘一切物力、人力的潜力和废旧物资建场；组织老弱退休人员和家属，以及季节作业工人到“五养五种”农场劳动。许多单位发动了职工，自己动手打坯、烧砖，收集废料，修建畜禽舍。抚顺市第六中学师生大搞勤工俭学，自己动手，仅在十天的时间内，未向国家要一分钱就盖起鸡、兔舍三十多间。
    目前，抚顺市厂矿、机关、学校以及街道居民等为了贯彻中央城乡并举大力发展副食品生产的方针，正积极做好准备工作，各农场都保护了母畜和种卵，自繁自养；还准备充分利用荒山荒地，建立起饲料基地，争取畜、禽、蛋更大的发展。
    本报讯　四川南充专区饮食行业职工，结合业务，从生产入手，积极发展养猪事业。截至1959年12月20日止，全区饮食业养猪已达一万四千三百七十六头。按饮食行业从业人员六千多人计算，平均每人养猪三点四十一头；全区一千二百四十八个饮食店中，平均每店已养猪十点四头。由于饮食行业养猪的大量发展，全区饮食店从去年10月份起，实现熟食用肉全部自给；有一百一十七个店，做到肉食自给外，还外调肥猪二千八百多头供应城镇和工矿区。
    南充专区饮食行业在发展养猪事业中，主要取得以下几点经验：
    第一、加强党的领导。开始有些职工不赞成饮食行业养猪，有人说“人手少照顾不过来”等等。于是有关部门领导饮食业职工算了三笔账：算政治账，使职工明确饮食业养猪对支援国家建设，供应市场的重大意义；算经济账，明确饮食业养猪对增加社会物质财富，增加资金积累的作用；算潜力账，明确饮食业养猪有利条件很多，因而在全区饮食行业迅速掀起了一个养猪高潮。
    第二、根据勤俭办一切事业的精神，因陋就简，采用“穷”办法自建猪圈，做到少花或不花钱又能多办事。南充县东观镇五个饮食店的六十个职工，缺乏原料就自动投出木板、石板，经过七个通宵的苦战，终于做到了不买材料，不请工人，不花资金，建成了能养一百多头的两个小型养猪场。
    第三、商农大协作，解决猪源问题。饮食行业全面发展养猪以后，猪源很缺乏。为了解决这个问题，他们采取了以下三条办法：饮食店将饲养场积蓄的肥料支援人民公社，人民公社帮助饮食业解决猪源；自繁自养，将符合出口标准的大肥猪支援商业部门，掉换架子猪。
    第四、从多方解决饲料问题。充分利用饮食行业的副产品，将饮食业剩下的残汤泔水、下脚料、豆渣全部利用起来喂猪，可以解决二万头猪所需饲料一半以上，效果比粮食还好；发动职工利用业余时间开发屋前宅后空地和田边地角种饲料。全区饮食业现已种的饲料达七百五十亩以上。
    第五、专业劳动与义务劳动相结合。发动职工献计献策，大力改革了一批炊厨工具，减轻了劳动强度，提高了劳动效率，节约了劳动力。在此基础上，一般饮食店都抽出了专职从业人员担任猪的饲养工作，同时发动职工抽出一定时间轮流参加义务劳动。（附图片）
