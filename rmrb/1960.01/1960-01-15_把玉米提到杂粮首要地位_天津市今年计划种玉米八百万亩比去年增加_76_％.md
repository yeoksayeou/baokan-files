    Elevating Corn to the Primary Position Among Coarse Grains
    Tianjin Plans to Plant Eight Million Mu of Corn This Year, a 76% Increase Over Last Year

    (Our report) In accordance with the new situation of great development in agriculture and animal husbandry, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee has elevated corn to the primary position among coarse grain crops. This year, the plan is to plant eight million mu of corn, an expansion of 76% compared to 1959.

    Each county in Tianjin is carrying out a competition to build high-yield corn plots, vowing to win the high-yield corn championship. Twenty-three communes in Jiaohe County have launched a competition to create large-scale high-yield corn plots. Hao Village, Bo Town, Wali Wang, and six other communes have jointly planned a 150,000 mu high-yield corn plot. At present, the broad masses of commune members are carrying out crash programs to adjust ridges, transport fertilizer, and construct farms (pig farms) and stations (pumping stations), requiring the application of 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, with the ability to irrigate during droughts and prevent runoff from rainfall of up to 200 millimeters at a time. Ba County plans to plant 700,000 mu of spring and summer corn this year, and is currently carrying out a competition to build square fields. More than 300,000 mu of high-yield corn plots in fifteen communes throughout the county have basically completed land leveling and drainage and irrigation projects.

    When arranging the planting plan for 1960 crops, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee recognized that corn is a high-yield grain crop and also a high-yield feed crop. From the perspective of natural conditions, the city's rural areas have generally been able to basically eliminate drought and flood disasters in recent years due to large-scale water conservancy construction. The soil and climate are also extremely suitable for growing corn, so it was decided to expand the planting area of corn. This year, the city plans to plant eight million mu of corn, of which 2.5 million to 3 million mu will be cultivated as large-scale high-yield plots, requiring an average yield of 300 jin per mu.

    In order to ensure the realization of the production increase plan, it is necessary to focus on water, fertilizer, and seeds. Each mu of corn should be applied with an average of three to five carts of base fertilizer and two to three top dressings. Water conservancy should be built to ensure that 80% of spring corn is generally irrigated two to three times before and after the wheat harvest; and combined with the construction of soil ridge fields and other flood prevention projects. Popularize the planting of excellent varieties such as Golden Queen and White Horse Tooth. In order to strengthen the leadership of corn production, it is required that a corn production front be established at every level from the county to the production team, with a leading group composed of three to five members at each level, and a secretary appointed to take command, lead corn production, and resolutely seize a bumper harvest of corn.

    把玉米提到杂粮首要地位
    天津市今年计划种玉米八百万亩比去年增加76％
    本报讯　天津市委根据农牧业大发展的新形势，把玉米提高到杂粮作物的首要位置上来。今年计划种植玉米八百万亩，比1959年扩大76％。
    天津市各县正在开展建设玉米丰产方竞赛，誓夺玉米高产冠军。交河县二十三个公社掀起了大搞玉米丰产方竞赛。郝村、泊镇、洼里王等六个公社，统一规划了一个十五万亩的玉米丰产方。现在广大社员正在突击调畦、送粪和修场（猪场）、建站（扬水站），要求亩施万斤肥，旱了能浇，一次降雨二百毫米不发生径流。霸县今年计划种春夏玉米七十万亩，现在正开展建方田竞赛，全县十五个公社已有三十多万亩玉米丰产方基本上完成了平地和排灌工程。
    中共天津市委，在安排1960年农作物的配置计划时，认识到玉米是粮食的高产作物，也是饲料的高产作物。从自然条件上看，全市农村几年来由于大规模地进行水利建设，一般旱、涝灾害可以基本解除；土壤、气候又极适宜种玉米，因此决定扩大种植玉米面积。今年全市计划种植玉米八百万亩，其中培养大面积丰产方二百五十万至三百万亩，要求平均亩产达到三百斤。
    为了保证增产计划的实现，要大抓水、肥、种。每亩玉米平均施底肥三、五车，追肥二、三次。兴修水利以保证80％的春玉米在麦收前后普遍烧水二、三次；并结合做好土埂畦田等防涝工程。普遍种植金皇后、白马牙等优良品种。为加强对玉米生产的领导，要求从县到生产队，层层要建立一条玉米生产战线，逐级由三、五名委员组成一个领导小组，并确定一名书记挂帅，领导玉米生产，坚决夺取玉米的大丰收。
