To Promote the Communist Style, We Must Also Propagate Communist Ideology

    The communist style is based on communist ideology. Only when the broad masses recognize that individual and immediate interests depend on collective and long-term interests, and that individual happiness depends on the realization of lofty communist ideals, can they demonstrate the heroic spirit of communist self-sacrifice and the revolutionary spirit of daring to uphold the truth in their labor. Therefore, in order to promote the communist style, we must propagate communist ideology among the masses. Some comrades believe that we should not talk much about communist ideology and the communist style when we are still building socialism. This idea is incorrect.

    First of all, they have forgotten that our party is a communist party. Our goal is to establish a communist society. Therefore, our party must adhere to the communist standpoint and world outlook at all stages of the revolution, and use communist ideology to guide the revolutionary movement.

    “The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the future of that movement.” ("The Communist Manifesto") During the stage of the people's democratic revolution in our country, Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "At the present time, there is no doubt that we should expand the propaganda of communist ideas and step up the study of Marxism-Leninism. Without such propaganda and study, we will not only be unable to guide the Chinese revolution to the future socialist stage, but also unable to guide the current democratic revolution to victory." ("On New Democracy") He also pointed out that the propaganda of the communist ideological system is different from the action program of New Democracy at that time, but this difference cannot be used as a reason to cancel the guiding role of communist ideology. Since we had to expand the propaganda of communist ideology and use communist ideology as a guiding ideology during the democratic revolution stage, then today, when we are carrying out the socialist revolution and socialist construction to lay the foundation for communism, we should of course expand the propaganda of communist ideology even more.

    Some people are afraid to promote communist ideology in the socialist stage, and do not mention "communism," because they do not understand what it means to build socialism and what the relationship is between building socialism and transitioning to communism. As everyone knows, building socialism is not building an independent social form that is neither capitalist nor communist. Marx said: Socialism is "a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birth marks of the old society from whose womb it emerges." Socialist society is the immature primary stage of the communist social form. It is a communist society, but it still bears the traces of the old society. Therefore, building socialism is by no means to permanently consolidate the traces of the old society without changing them, but first of all to develop, expand and improve things that belong to the communist social form, including: things common to both stages of communism, such as public ownership of the means of production, development of production to serve the growing material and cultural needs of the entire society, planned and proportionate development of the national economy, etc.; and things unique to the communist stage, such as the bud of distribution according to need, gradually creating conditions to finally eliminate the various traces left over from the old society and transition to communism.

    It should be pointed out that in the process of socialist construction, class struggle will still exist for a long time, especially the struggle in the political and ideological fields will continue to exist, sometimes high and sometimes low, sometimes rising and falling, sometimes sharp and sometimes缓和. The struggle in the political and ideological fields is essentially a struggle between the two ideological systems of communism and capitalism. There is no vacuum in the ideological field; if communist ideology does not occupy it, bourgeois ideology will. Therefore, in the process of socialist construction, we must not only promote the communist style, but also tirelessly propagate communist ideology, so that all workers establish the communist labor attitude of serving the people wholeheartedly, working tirelessly, and not caring about rewards, and promote the communist spirit of collaboration.

### 要发扬共产主义风格也要宣传共产主义思想

    要发扬共产主义风格也要宣传共产主义思想
    共产主义风格是以共产主义思想为基础的。只有当广大群众认识到个人利益和目前利益依存于集体利益和长远利益，个人幸福依存于崇高的共产主义理想的实现，才能在劳动中表现出共产主义的自我牺牲的英雄气概和敢于坚持真理的革命精神。因此，为了发扬共产主义风格，必须向群众宣传共产主义思想。有些同志认为，当我们还在建设社会主义的时候，不应该大讲共产主义思想和共产主义风格。这种想法是不对的。
    首先，他们忘记了我们的党是共产主义的党。我们的目的是建立共产主义社会。因此，我们的党在革命的一切阶段都必须坚持共产主义者的立场和世界观，用共产主义思想指导革命运动。
  “共产党人为着工人阶级的最近目的和利益而奋斗，但他们在现今运动中同时还坚持着运动的将来。”（“共产党宣言”）在我国人民民主主义革命阶段，毛泽东同志就曾经说过：“在现时，毫无疑义，应该扩大共产主义思想的宣传，加紧马克思列宁主义的学习，没有这种宣传和学习，不但不能引导中国革命到将来的社会主义阶段上去，而且也不能指导现时的民主革命达到胜利。”（“新民主主义论”）并且指出，共产主义思想体系的宣传同当时的新民主主义的行动纲领是有区别的，但是，这种区别决不能用来做为取消共产主义思想的指导作用的理由。既然在民主革命阶段尚且要扩大共产主义思想的宣传，以共产主义思想作为指导思想，那末，在进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设为共产主义奠定基础的今天，我们当然更加应该扩大共产主义思想的宣传了。
    有的人在社会主义阶段不敢宣传共产主义思想，言不及“共产主义”，还由于他们不懂得究竟什么是建设社会主义，建设社会主义和过渡到共产主义是什么关系。大家知道，建设社会主义，并不是建设一个既非资本主义又非共产主义的独立的社会形态。马克思说：社会主义是“刚刚从资本主义社会中产生出来，因此在各方面，即在经济、道德和智慧方面都还保留其所由脱胎出来的那个旧社会痕迹的共产主义社会。”社会主义社会是共产主义这个社会形态的尚未成熟的初级阶段。它是共产主义社会，不过还带有旧社会的痕迹。因此，建设社会主义就决不是要把旧社会的痕迹永远地巩固下来，不加改变，而首先是要发展、扩大和提高属于共产主义社会形态的东西，其中包括：共产主义两个阶段共同的东西，像生产资料公有制、生产发展服务于整个社会日益增长的物质文化需要、国民经济有计划按比例地发展等等；和共产主义阶段所特有的东西，像按需分配的萌芽等，逐步创造条件，以便最后消灭旧社会遗留的各种痕迹，过渡到共产主义。
    应当指出，在社会主义建设过程中，阶级斗争还会长期存在，特别是政治思想领域内的斗争还会时高时低，时起时伏，时而尖锐时而缓和地继续存在下去。政治思想领域里的斗争，本质上就是共产主义和资本主义两种思想体系的斗争。思想阵地是没有真空地带的，共产主义思想不去占领，资产阶级思想就要去占领。因此，在社会主义建设的过程中，我们不但要提倡共产主义风格，而且要不懈地宣传共产主义思想，使劳动者人人树立全心全意为人民服务，不辞劳苦，不计报酬的共产主义劳动态度，发扬共产主义的协作精神。
