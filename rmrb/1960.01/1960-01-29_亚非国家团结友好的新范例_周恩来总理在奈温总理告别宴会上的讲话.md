A New Model of Solidarity and Friendship Between Asian and African Countries
Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at Premier Ne Win's Farewell Banquet

Your Excellency Respected Premier Ne Win, Distinguished Guests from Burma, Friends, Comrades:

Today, we are honored to have the opportunity to attend the grand banquet held by His Excellency Premier Ne Win and gather once again with our distinguished guests. We are very grateful to Your Excellency the Prime Minister for the speech filled with enthusiasm and friendship for the Chinese people just now.

His Excellency Premier Ne Win's visit to our country has made a significant contribution to enhancing the traditional friendship and mutual understanding between our two countries. Our talks were very smooth. The Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Agreement on Border Issues have been signed in Beijing today. The signing of this treaty and agreement marks a new stage in the friendly relations between our two countries. Premier, I believe you will agree with me that this is a victory for the people of our two countries and a victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in my own name, to express my heartfelt congratulations to the Burmese government and people, as well as to Your Excellency and all the distinguished guests.

Premier, the reason why our talks were able to achieve such great success this time is not accidental. This is the result of the consistent policy of friendly cooperation adopted by our two countries after achieving independence, and it is also inseparable from the sincere and frank attitude of both sides in seeking to solve problems in this meeting.

In recent years, with the joint efforts of our two governments and peoples, the friendly relations between our two countries have made great progress. Admittedly, there are also some historical problems between our two countries. However, we have always believed that as long as both sides adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, these problems can be easily resolved through consultation. Facts have proved that our belief is correct. The border issue between our two countries is a problem left over by imperialism, and the leaders of our two countries share this understanding. In order to resolve this issue fairly and reasonably, the governments of our two countries have made unremitting efforts in recent years. Now, after Premier Ne Win's personal visit, we have finally reached a principled agreement on resolving the Sino-Burmese border issue, paving the way for a comprehensive solution to this issue. We are determined to make the border between our two countries a border of peace and friendship, and we have reason to believe that with our joint efforts, the Sino-Burmese border will surely become a border of peace and friendship.

China and Burma are ancient countries, and they are also young countries. We have both just gained independence not long ago, and the people of our two countries are wholeheartedly devoted to building our respective countries well; we have every reason to be friendly and cooperate with each other, and we have no reason to be hostile or invade each other. The people of our two countries are "Pauk-Phaw" (siblings). The Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression that we have signed embodies this close "Pauk-Phaw" relationship between the people of our two countries. The signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Agreement on Border Issues further confirms the belief that independent Asian and African countries should and can unite in friendship, and creates a new model for the development of this solidarity and friendship among Asian and African countries.

Premier, you came to our country with the sincere friendship of the Burmese people towards the Chinese people, and tomorrow you will be leaving Beijing to return home with the great achievements of this visit to our country. Please allow me to once again express my gratitude for your visit, and please convey the equally sincere friendship of our people to the Burmese people. Today is the traditional Chinese Spring Festival. According to our customs, this is a day for family reunions. Now we and our Burmese friends are celebrating this festival together like a family. This symbolizes that the unity and friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people will be further consolidated and strengthened in the years to come.

I propose a toast:

To the evergreen friendship between China and Burma,
To peace in Asia and the world,
To the health of His Excellency Premier Ne Win and all distinguished Burmese guests,
To the health of His Excellency President U Win Maung of the Union of Burma,
Cheers!

    亚非国家团结友好的新范例
    周恩来总理在奈温总理告别宴会上的讲话尊敬的奈温总理阁下，缅甸的贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    今天，我们有机会参加奈温总理阁下举行的隆重宴会，同我们的贵宾们再一次欢聚一堂，感到十分荣幸。我们十分感谢总理阁下刚才所发表的对中国人民充满了热情和友好的讲话。
    奈温总理阁下这次来我国访问，对于增进我们两国的传统友谊和相互了解作出了重大的贡献。我们的会谈非常顺利。中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅两国关于边界问题的协定今天已经在北京签订。这个条约和协定的签订标志着我们两国的友好关系进入了一个新的阶段。总理阁下，我相信你会同意我，这是我们两国人民的胜利，这是关于和平共处的五项原则的胜利。请允许我代表中国政府和人民，并以我个人的名义向缅甸政府和人民，以及阁下和全体贵宾们表示衷心的祝贺。
    总理阁下，我们这次会谈所以能够取得如此巨大的成就。并不是偶然的。这是我们两国在各自取得独立以后一贯采取友好合作的方针的结果，同时也是同双方在这次会谈中一致采取了力求解决问题的诚意和坦率的态度分不开的。
    这些年来，在我们两国政府和人民的共同努力下，我们两国的友好关系有了长足的发展。固然，在我们两国之间也存在着某些历史上遗留下来的问题，但是，我们始终抱有信念，只要双方坚持和平共处五项原则，这些问题都是不难通过协商取得合理的解决的。事实证明，我们的信念是正确的。我们两国之间的边界问题是帝国主义遗留下来的一个问题，在这一点上我们两国领导人的认识是一致的。为了公平合理地解决这个问题，几年来我们两国政府作了不懈的努力。现在，经过奈温总理的亲自来访，我们双方终于达成了关于解决中缅边界问题的原则协议，为全面解决这个问题铺平了道路。我们有决心使我们两国的边界成为和平友好的边界，我们有理由相信，在我们双方共同努力之下，中缅边界一定能够成为和平和友好的边界。
    我们中缅两国是古老的国家，又都是年轻的国家。我们都刚刚独立不久，我们两国人民都一心一意要把我们各自的国家建设好；我们有一切的理由互相友好和合作，我们没有任何理由互相敌对或侵犯。我们两国人民是“胞波”。我们签订的友好和互不侵犯条约，体现了我们两国人民的这种亲如手足的“胞波”关系。中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅关于边界问题的协定的签订，更有力地证实了独立了的亚非国家应该而且可以团结友好的信念，并且为发展亚非国家的这种团结友好创造了一个新的范例。
    总理阁下，你带着缅甸人民对中国人民的亲切友情来到了我国，明天你将带着这次来我国访问的巨大成就就要离开北京回国了，请允许我再一次对你的来访表示感谢，并且请你将我国人民同样亲切的友情带给缅甸人民。今天正是中国传统的春节，按照我们的风俗习惯，这是亲人团聚的日子，现在我们和缅甸的朋友们正像一家人一样共同欢度这个节日，这象征着中缅两国人民的团结和友谊在今后的岁月中将更加巩固，更加紧密。
    我提议：
    为中缅友谊万古长青，
    为亚洲和世界的和平，
    为奈温总理阁下和缅甸全体贵宾们的健康，
    为缅甸联邦吴温貌总统阁下的健康，
    干杯！　（以上两个标题是编者加的）
