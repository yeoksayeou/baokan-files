    Short Essays by Heroes on High Speed
    In the extraordinary days of 1959, let's not even mention the tremendous and glorious achievements our country has made in politics, economics, culture, and construction. Just take our team as an example. We have also undergone unprecedented, enormous, and profound training and testing. For example, in the construction of the Great Hall of the People, we completed the task of tying 650 tons of reinforcing steel in just nine days and nights, a task that would normally take a year and a half. Such high speed and complex technical requirements are rare in the world, and something we had never even imagined in the past. This is the result of the Party's cultivation and education and the shining light of the General Line. As the motherland's construction advances by leaps and bounds, we must demand of ourselves a spirit of continuous revolution and continue to advance at high speed.
    In order to take on even greater and more numerous tasks in 1960, we guarantee to the Party that we will not add a single person but will do even better than in 1959. We are determined to throw ourselves into the new battle with a new attitude of vigorously engaging in technical revolution and cultural revolution, and humbly learning from others, to complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the state at high speed.
    Zhang Baifa, Steel Bar Worker, Beijing No. 3 Construction Company

    The leadership of the Party is the guiding light for high-speed leaps forward. It is the Party that educated us to overcome complacency; it is the Party that educated us to humbly learn from advanced experiences; it is the Party that led us to break down superstitions, liberate our minds, and continuously innovate our technology; it is the Party that encouraged us to unite as one and pool our wisdom to overcome difficulties.
    All Workers of No. 1 Youth Blast Furnace, Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant

    From this high-speed leap into the 1960 movement, I have deeply realized that the key to whether or not you can leap over seasons and years does not lie in whether you are a mechanical worker, a textile worker, or some other kind of worker, but in whether or not you have the determination.
    Li Xuebin, Weaver, Tianjin No. 1 State Cotton Mill
    ***
    Facts have proven that production potential is infinite and technical innovation has no limit. As long as we dare to think and dare to act, boldly create, and earnestly learn from advanced experiences, and improve our operating methods, last year's high record can certainly be broken. If we establish the lofty ambition to surpass historical records, no number can intimidate us.
    He Fucai, Worker, Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory
    ***
    High speed comes from mutual cooperation and mutual learning: If one inch is blocked, ten thousand feet are ineffective; one palm cannot clap, and a single tree does not make a forest. If only one team completes the task, the Huai River cannot be harnessed early.
    Zhang Youdao, Leader of the Anhui Water Control Youth Shock Brigade

    英雄小论高速度
    在1959年的不平凡的日子里，先甭说我们国家在政治上、经济上，文化上以及生产建设各方面取得了多么巨大而辉煌的成就，就拿我们队来说，也受到空前的、巨大而深刻的锻炼和考验。比如人民大会堂的工程，我们只用了九天九夜的时间，完成了在通常情况下要一年半才能完成的六百五十吨钢筋的绑扎任务，这样的高速度和复杂的技术要求，是世界上少有的，也是我们过去想都没有想到的。这是党的培养教育和总路线的光辉照耀的结果。祖国的建设在一日千里地前进，我们必须以不断革命的精神来要求自己，继续高速度前进。
    为了把1960年的更大更多的任务担当起来，我们向党保证，决不增加一个人而却要比1959年干得更出色。我们决心以大搞技术革命、文化革命和虚心向别人学习的新姿态投入新的战斗。高速度完成党和国家交给的任务。

    党的领导是高速度跃进的明灯。是党教育我们克服了松劲情绪；是党教育我们要虚心学习先进经验；是党领导我们破除迷信，解放思想，不断革新了技术，是党鼓励我们团结一致集思广益地克服了困难。
    本溪第一钢铁厂一号青年高炉全体工人

    从这次高速度跨进1960年运动中，我深深体会到：决定能不能跨季越年的关键，不在于你是机械工人还是纺织工人，或是其他什么工人，而在于你有没有决心。
    天津国棉一厂织布工人　李学斌
    ***
    事实证明生产潜力是无穷的，技术革新是没有顶的，只要敢想敢干，大胆创造，认真学习先进经验，改进操作方法，去年的高纪录一定能突破。树立起一定要超过历史纪录的雄心大志，什么数字也吓不倒人。
    沈阳风动工具厂工人　和福才

    高速度要从互相协作互相学习中得来：一尺不通，万丈无效；孤掌拍不响，单树不成林，光一个队完成任务，就不能早日把淮河治好。安徽治水青年突击队队长　张友道
