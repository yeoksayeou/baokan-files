Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 12th: Xichong County, Sichuan Province, is carrying out a "Ten Dragons" movement of semi-mechanization and tool improvement, reforming the tools of all processes in ten major production projects such as agricultural production, water conservancy construction, and diversified operations in complete sets, pushing the tool reform movement in rural areas to a new stage.

The main goal of the "Ten Dragons" tool reform movement in Xichong County is to require that every process of all production processes in pig raising, silkworm raising, cooking, water conservancy construction, water lifting, agricultural and sideline product processing, harvesting and threshing, transportation, deep plowing, land preparation, sowing, and sweet potato production and processing use semi-mechanized tools and improved tools, forming a flow-line operation to comprehensively improve labor efficiency. According to calculations, the realization of the "Ten Dragons" requires a total of 93 types and more than 470,000 pieces of new-style tools, which is enough to double the existing new-style tools in the county. Each production project generally includes four or five main processes and seven or eight main tools. For example, water conservancy construction has five main processes such as excavation, transportation, and tamping, and twelve tools such as soil cranes, tamping machines, aerial cableways, and soil trains. Silkworm raising has seven tools such as rotary silkworm frames, mulberry cutting machines, cocoon picking devices, and spider clusters. The use of these semi-mechanized tools and improved tools in complete sets allows each process to be interlocked and closely connected, which can comprehensively improve labor efficiency. At present, in addition to the complete set of sweet potato production and processing tools that have been reformed in Xichong County, there are also 32 water conservancy construction sites, 37 pig farms, 26 silkworm houses, and 225 canteens that have realized flow-line operations with semi-mechanized and improved tools. These new tools generally have the characteristics of high efficiency, sturdiness and durability, and relatively simple manufacturing. Generally, they can improve work efficiency by two to three times, and some can improve work efficiency by ten to twenty times. In places where tools have been reformed in complete sets, it has been possible for one person to do the work of two or more, and work efficiency has been multiplied. Although this movement has not been carried out for a long time, the county has saved more than 7.5 million labor days. According to rough calculations, after the tools for ten production projects are reformed in complete sets this spring, the county can save more than 20 million labor days.

Xichong County is located in the hilly area of northern Sichuan. In order to change the face of water scarcity and thin soil, it has been carrying out large-scale farmland capital construction and comprehensively reforming farming techniques since 1958. The scale of diversified operations such as pig raising and silkworm raising has also expanded rapidly, so all aspects need to increase tens of thousands of laborers. According to calculations, the county's labor demand in 1960 will increase by more than 13 million compared to last year. Under this new situation, reforming tools only in some production projects and some processes can no longer solve the problem of labor shortage in many aspects. The Xichong County Party Committee seriously studied and summarized the county's experience in realizing the complete set reform of sweet potato production and processing tools, and realized that enabling each major production project to realize semi-mechanization and improved tooling is the key to rapidly and exponentially improving work efficiency. The county party committee promptly mobilized the masses to launch the "Ten Dragons" tool reform movement. They selected 93 types from the various improved tools that had been promoted, matched them into ten sets according to the ten production projects, and organized the masses to manufacture and reform in sets.

From reforming the tools of one part of a production project to realizing semi-mechanization and improved tooling of all processes in each major production project, the rural tool reform movement has taken a comprehensive and in-depth step. First, it powerfully mobilized the broad masses to reform various tools in a planned, comprehensive, and systematic manner, completely changing the phenomenon of treating the head when the head hurts and treating the foot when the foot hurts, and promoted the rapid and comprehensive improvement of work efficiency. Second, through supporting facilities, a comprehensive appraisal of various tools reformed in recent years has been carried out, and measures such as finalizing the design before manufacturing, modifying while using, and gradually improving have been adopted to ensure that various tools are more welcomed by the broad masses. Third, the development of this movement has prompted people to add and manufacture new tools in a planned manner according to the specific needs of each production, and the utilization rate of various tools has also been greatly improved. More than 40 types of tools in the county can be used for multiple purposes. For example, the mass grinder-miller tool can be used in agricultural and sideline product processing, pig raising, and cooking; the main tools for transportation and cooking can also be used in other projects. As long as they are rationally dispatched, they can be used. Fourth, the complete set of tool reforms tightly connects and promotes each process of each production project, prompting various tools to gradually lay the foundation for the realization of agricultural mechanization from low to high, from simple to complex, from hand-cranked and foot-pedaled to the use of animal power, water power, and electric power. At present, the county has used 24 types of semi-mechanized tools, and some tools have been driven by animal power and water power. If motors and transmission equipment are installed, mechanized production can be realized.

Xichong County, according to the current production needs, distinguishing the importance and urgency, decided to focus on five aspects such as water conservancy construction, pig raising, and agricultural and sideline product processing, and formulated a plan to comprehensively reform tools in complete sets. The county established a tool reform research group including the county party secretary, scientific and technical personnel, iron and wood workers, and veteran farmers, concentrated the suggestions of the masses, absorbed the advantages of various designs, and made design drawings of new tools, researching and trial-producing at the same time. During the trial production process, outstanding workers from iron and wood factories in various districts and communes were also transferred to participate, and they brought the technology to various places to ensure the timely promotion of various new-style tools. In addition, after the new tools are successfully trial-produced, they are repeatedly tested to more fully accept the opinions of the masses and ensure the quality of the new tools.

In the movement to reform tools in complete sets, the 34 communes in the county uniformly dispatched manpower and materials, and universally established iron and wood factories with three beds (lathes, planers, drilling machines) and five tools (hacksaws, steel files, pliers, taps, hand drills), and 507 management districts universally established repair stations with five tools, fundamentally changing the situation of uneven distribution of technical strength and lack of equipment and funds in the agricultural cooperatives period, and greatly accelerating the speed of tool reform.

    西充县力争十个生产项目半机械化和工具改良化
    成套革新农具　全面提高工效
    选出九十三种新工具，按生产项目配成“十条龙”，组织群众按套造按套改
    本报成都12日电　四川省西充县开展半机械化和工具改良化的“十条龙”运动，成套地改革农业生产、水利建设、多种经营等十个主要生产项目全部工序的工具，将农村中的工具改革运动推上新阶段。
    西充县工具改革“十条龙”运动的主要目标是要求养猪，养蚕，炊事，水利施工，提水，农副产品加工，收割脱粒，运输，深耕、整地、播种以及红薯生产和加工的全部生产过程的每一工序，都用上半机械化工具和改良工具，形成流水作业，全面提高劳动效率。根据计算，实现“十条龙”共需九十三种、四十七万多件新式工具，只要把全县现有新式工具翻一番就够了。每个生产项目一般都包括了四五个主要工序和七八种主要工具。例如水利施工有开方、运输、夯土等五种主要工序和土起重机、打夯机、空中索道、土火车等十二种工具。养蚕有转动式蚕架、切桑机、采茧器、蜘蛛簇等七种工具。这些半机械化工具和改良工具的成套使用，使各个工序环环相扣，紧密衔接，能全面提高劳动效率。现在，西充县除已成套地改革了红薯生产和加工的工具以外，还有三十二处水利工地、三十七个生猪饲养场、二十六处蚕房和二百二十五个食堂实现了半机械化和改良工具的流水作业。这些新工具普遍具有效率高、坚固耐用、制造比较简单等特点，一般可以提高工效两三倍，部分可提高工效一、二十倍。成套地改革了工具的地方，已经做到一人顶两人、一人顶多人，工效成倍地提高。这个运动虽然开展不久，全县已节省了七百五十多万个劳动日。根据粗略计算，今年春天十个生产项目成套地改革工具以后，全县可以节约劳动日二千多万个。
    西充县位于四川北部的丘陵区，为了改变水源贫乏、土地瘦薄的面貌，从1958年开始，大搞农田基本建设和全面改革耕作技术，养猪、养蚕等多种经营的规模也迅速扩大，因而各方面都需要增加数以万计的劳动力。根据计算，全县1960年的需工量就要比去年增加一千三百多万个。在这个新的形势下，仅在一部分生产项目和一部分工序上改革工具，已经不能够解决多方面劳动力不足的问题。中共西充县委认真研究总结了全县实现红薯生产和加工工具成套地改革的经验，认识到使各个主要生产项目实现半机械化和改良工具化，是迅速地成倍地提高工效的关键。县委及时发动群众掀起了“十条龙”的工具改革运动。他们从已经推广的各种改良工具中选出九十三种，按照十个生产项目配成十套，并组织群众按套制造按套改革。
    从改革一个生产项目一部分工序的工具到各个主要生产项目全部工序实现半机械化和改良工具化，使农村的工具改革运动全面深入地发展了一步。首先有力地动员了广大群众有计划地全面系统地改革各种工具，彻底改变了头痛医头、脚痛医脚的现象，促使工效迅速地全面地提高。第二，通过配套，对近几年来改革的各种工具进行了全面鉴定，并采取先定型再制造，边用边改，步步提高的办法，保证各种工具更加为广大群众所欢迎。第三，这一运动的开展，促使人们针对各项生产的具体需要，有计划地增添和制造新的工具，各种工具的利用率也大大提高，全县有四十多种工具可以一物多用。例如群碾群磨这一工具便可以在农副产品加工、养猪、炊事中配套使用；运输和炊事的主要工具还全部可以在其它项目中使用，只要加以合理调度就成了。第四，工具改革成套地实现，使各个生产项目的各个工序紧密联系、相互推动，促使各种工具从低到高、从简单到复杂、从手摇脚踏到利用畜力、水力、电力，逐步打下实现农业机械化的基础。现在，这个县已经用上了二十四种半机械化工具，部分工具已用畜力、水力带动，如果安上马达和传动设备，就可以实现机械化生产。
    西充县根据当前生产需要，分别轻重缓急，决定以水利施工、养猪、农副产品加工等五个方面为重点，订出了全面成套地改革工具的计划。全县成立了包括县委书记，科学技术人员，铁、木工人，老农在内的工具改革研究组，集中群众的建议，吸取各种设计的优点，作出新工具的设计图样，边研究边试制。在试制过程中，还调集各区、公社铁木工厂的优秀工人参加，通过他们把技术带到各地，保证各种新式工具及时推广。此外，在新工具试制成功后，还再三进行试用，以便更充分地接受群众的意见，保证新工具的质量。
    在成套地改革工具的运动中，全县三十四个公社统一调度人力物力，普遍建立了拥有三床（车床、刨床、钻床）、五具（钢锯、钢锉、老虎钳、丝板、手摇钻）的铁木工厂，五百零七个管理区普遍建立了拥有五具的修配站，根本改变了农业社时期技术力量分布不均和缺少设备、资金的状况，大大加快了工具改革的速度。（附图片）
