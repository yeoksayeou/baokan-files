Qaidam Oil Base Grows Rapidly
High-Yielding Oil Area Builds Nearly a Hundred Wells with Daily Production Reaching Over 1,600 Tons
Indigenous Methods Combined with Foreign Methods to Establish a Refinery with an Annual Processing Capacity of 300,000 Tons

(Our newspaper's report from Lenghu on January 19th) The Qinghai Provincial Petroleum Administration earnestly implements the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, enabling the petroleum industry in the Qaidam Basin to achieve high-speed development.

Qaidam currently has thirteen oil and gas fields, eight of which have industrial exploitation value. Since June 1959, in the Lenghu No. 5 high-yield oil field, nearly a hundred production wells have been drilled in just over half a year, with daily crude oil production reaching over 1,600 tons. A refinery capable of processing 300,000 tons of crude oil annually and basic construction projects such as drilling, extraction, refining, storage, and transportation have also been established accordingly. A petroleum industrial base of initial scale has begun to take shape.

Carrying out petroleum development work on this desolate Gobi Desert poses more difficulties than production and construction in the interior. However, under the inspiration of the spirit of the Party's General Line, the Party Committee of the Qinghai Petroleum Administration fully mobilized the masses, relied on their own efforts, started with indigenous methods, and combined foreign and indigenous methods to overcome difficulties one by one. When steel pipes were insufficient, the workers adopted simplified casing procedures, using less or no casing depending on geological conditions; when there was not enough steel plate for making oil storage tanks, people built six earthen oil ponds with a capacity of several thousand tons each using rubble and cement; when drill bits could not be supplied, they launched a movement to manufacture indigenous drill bits, and as a result, more than a thousand drill bits were made. In order to better equip themselves, the workers also manufactured dozens of indigenous lathes. When the Youshashan Refinery started up last year using indigenous methods, it only had one gasoline drum for refining oil, but now it has developed into three refineries that are indigenous, foreign, and semi-indigenous and semi-foreign, with a total annual crude oil processing capacity of 110,000 tons.

While focusing on production and basic construction of the oil fields, the Qinghai Provincial Petroleum Administration has also trained a large number of skilled workers. At present, more than 4,300 people in the bureau can do more than two kinds of work, which can basically meet the needs of drilling and oil production this year. The workers have also set up more than ten auxiliary factories such as cement and ceramic pipe factories, which have solved the difficulty of insufficient material supply in this regard. In terms of vegetables, meat and other non-staple foods, they have established six non-staple food bases. The workers also used local materials, building tens of thousands of square meters of houses with adobe and reeds, solving the needs for office space and accommodation. All these achievements have played a certain guarantee role in the high-speed development of the Qaidam petroleum industry.

    柴达木石油基地成长迅速
    高产油区建井近百口日产量达到一千六百多吨
    土法上马洋土并举办起年处理三十万吨炼油厂
    本报冷湖19日电　青海省石油管理局认真贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，使柴达木盆地的石油工业获得了高速度的发展。
    柴达木现有油气田十三处，其中具有工业开采价值的油气田八处。1959年6月以来，在冷湖五号高产区油田，仅用半年多的时间就钻凿了近百口生产井，原油日产水平达到一千六百吨以上。每年可处理三十万吨原油的炼油厂和钻、采、炼、储、运等基本建设工程，也都相应地建立起来。一个初具规模的石油工业基地开始形成。
    在这个荒无人烟的戈壁滩上进行石油开发工作，比内地生产建设有着更多困难。但青海石油管理局党委在党的总路线的精神鼓舞下，充分发动群众，自力更生，土法上马，洋土结合，把困难一个个地克服了。钢管不足，职工们采用简化套管程序的办法，根据地质情况少用或不用套管；做储油罐的钢板不够，人们就用毛石水泥砌了容量达数千吨的六个土油池；钻头供应不上，他们就开展了一个制造土钻头的运动，结果，一千多只钻头就这样做了出来。职工们为了更好地装备自己，还制造了几十台土车床。油砂山炼油厂去年土法上马时，只有一个汽油桶炼油，现在已发展成三个土的、洋的和半土半洋的炼油厂，共年处理原油十一万吨。
    青海省石油管理局在抓生产抓油田基本建设的同时，还培训了大批技术工人。目前，全局已有四千三百多人能做两种以上的活，基本上可以满足今年钻井、采油方面的需要。职工们还办起了水泥、陶瓷管等十多个附属工厂，解决了这方面材料供应不足的困难。在蔬菜、肉食等副食品方面，他们建立了六个副食品基地。职工们还就地取材，用土坯芦苇盖起十几万平方米的房屋，解决了办公和住宿的需要。所有这些成就，都对柴达木石油工业的高速度发展起了一定的保证作用。
