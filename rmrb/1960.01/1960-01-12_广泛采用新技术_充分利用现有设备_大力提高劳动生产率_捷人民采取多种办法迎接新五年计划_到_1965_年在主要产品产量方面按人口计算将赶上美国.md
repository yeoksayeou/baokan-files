Prague, January 11th (Reported by our newspaper) The directives for the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) issued by the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government paint a magnificent and splendid vision for the working people. During the Third Five-Year Plan, Czechoslovakia will complete socialist construction. In 1965, the total industrial output will be six times that of 1937 before liberation. By 1965, Czechoslovakia will exceed West Germany's current level in terms of per capita output of major products; except for electricity production, other products will catch up with or exceed the existing level of the United States.

This is an inspiring and historically significant task. The Czechoslovak working people have responded to the call of the Party and the government with enthusiastic discussions and active actions. As a worker named Vanik from the "West Czech Paper Mill" in the Pilsen region said: "The great vision of the Third Five-Year Plan fills our hearts with joy and pride. In the coming years, we will definitely write a glorious page in our construction cause."

This kind of heroic and confident voice is constantly coming from all over the country. Many workers have expressed that no matter how difficult the tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan are, we have enough confidence and strength to complete them.

When discussing the development figures and specific tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan, Czechoslovak workers, farmers, and other working people focused on developing new technologies, fully utilizing existing equipment capacity, and improving labor productivity. This is because these are the basic characteristics of the Third Five-Year Plan. Of the increased industrial output during the new Five-Year Plan period, 36% will be achieved through expanding machinery and equipment. Since most of Czechoslovakia's arable land has already been utilized, developing agriculture will also mainly rely on improving labor productivity. In the new Five-Year Plan, the application of chemical fertilizers per hectare of land will be doubled.

In order to achieve this great task, many factories and rural areas have already begun to take various measures in order to lay a good foundation for the implementation of the Third Five-Year Plan. Some factories have decided to adopt automated and semi-automated technical equipment on a larger scale starting now. Some factories have already changed their production to two-shift operations entirely or partially. This allows the labor force and production equipment capacity to be more fully utilized and to exert greater potential. For example, after some workshops of the Bratislava Electrical Engineering Factory changed to a two-shift system, production increased by 30%, and the labor productivity of each worker increased by an average of 27%. The largest factory in the country, the Lenin Factory, has been completely converted to a two-shift system, and some other factories have decided to convert to a two-shift system starting in 1960. The Jekade Blansko Factory is responsible for producing dozens of large turbine machines during the Third Five-Year Plan. If it were done according to the existing manpower and equipment, it would be difficult to complete this task. However, after full discussions, the workers decided to change the production to a two-shift system, which can ensure the successful completion of this task without increasing manpower.

In order to adapt to the widespread adoption of new technologies and the further improvement of labor productivity during the Third Five-Year Plan, improving technology has become a common demand of workers. Therefore, the number of workers participating in amateur technical studies in various factories has increased sharply. The Party organizations and trade unions of various factories have also attached great importance to improving the technical skills of workers, providing them with various convenient learning conditions. The Stalin Coal Mine, which was the first to complete its annual task ahead of schedule last year, also established a special committee to study how to improve labor productivity.

When the whole country was enthusiastically discussing the specific tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan, the Central Committee of the Czech Communist Party also timely put forward the slogan that outstandingly completing the production tasks of 1960 is the best preparation for the Third Five-Year Plan. In order to successfully complete the plan for 1960, the working people throughout the country have put forward tens of thousands of suggestions and guarantees. According to preliminary statistics, the presentation and adoption of these suggestions will make this year's production exceed the original target by about 10 billion crowns.

### 广泛采用新技术　充分利用现有设备　大力提高劳动生产率  捷人民采取多种办法迎接新五年计划  到1965年在主要产品产量方面按人口计算将赶上美国

    广泛采用新技术　充分利用现有设备　大力提高劳动生产率
    捷人民采取多种办法迎接新五年计划
    到1965年在主要产品产量方面按人口计算将赶上美国
    本报布拉格11日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会和政府所颁布的第三个五年计划（1961—1965）的指示，为劳动人民描绘出一幅灿烂宏伟的远景。在第三个五年计划中，捷克斯洛伐克将完成社会主义建设。1965年的工业总产量将等于解放前1937年的六倍，到1965年时，在按人口平均计算的主要产品产量方面，捷克斯洛伐克将超过西德现有的水平；除电力生产外，其它方面的产品也将赶上或超过美国现有的水平。
    这是一个鼓舞人心的具有历史意义的任务，捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民用热烈的讨论和积极的行动回答了党和政府的号召。正如比尔森州“西捷克造纸厂”的一个工人瓦尼克所说的：“第三个五年计划的伟大远景，使我们心中充满了喜悦和骄傲。在未来的几年中，我们一定会在我们的建设事业中写下光辉的一页。”
    这种豪迈的充满信心的声音从全国各地不断传来。许多工人都表示，第三个五年计划的任务再艰巨，我们也有足够的信心和力量完成它。
    捷克斯洛伐克工人、农民和其他劳动人民在讨论第三个五年计划的发展数字和各项具体任务时，把发展新技术、充分利用现有设备能力和提高劳动生产率作为中心。因为这是第三个五年计划的基本特色。新五年计划期内增加的工业产量中，有36％是通过扩大机器设备而实现的。由于捷克斯洛伐克的可耕地大部都已利用，发展农业也主要依靠提高劳动生产率。在新五年计划中，每公顷土地施用的化肥将增加一倍。
    为了实现这个巨大任务，许多工厂和农村已经开始采取各种措施，以便为第三个五年计划的实施打下良好的基础。一些工厂已决定从现在起就更大规模地采用自动化和半自动化的技术设备。有的工厂已经将生产全部或部分地改为两班作业制，这样可以使劳动力和生产设备能力得到更充分的利用，发挥更大的潜力。例如，布拉迪斯拉发电机技术工厂的一些车间改为二班作业制后，生产提高了30％，每个工人的劳动生产率平均提高了27％。全国最大的工厂——列宁工厂已经全部改为二班制，还有一些工厂已决定从1960年起改为二班制。捷卡德布朗斯科工厂在第三个五年计划期间担负着生产数十部大型透平机的任务，如果按照现有的人力和设备，要完成这一任务是困难的，但工人们经过充分的讨论，决定将生产改为两班制，这样就可在不增加人力的情况下，保证这一任务胜利完成。
    为了适应第三个五年计划期间新技术的广泛采用和劳动生产率的进一步提高，提高技术已成为工人们的普遍要求，因此，各工厂参加业余技术学习的工人急剧增加。各工厂的党组织、工会也对工人技术的提高给予了极大的重视，为他们提供各种便利的学习条件。在去年第一个提前完成全年任务的斯大林煤矿还成立了专门研究提高劳动生产率的委员会。
    当全国都在热烈讨论第三个五年计划的具体任务时，捷共中央也及时提出了出色地完成1960年的生产任务是对第三个五年计划最好的准备的口号。为了胜利完成1960年的计划，全国各地劳动人民提出了成千上万条的建议和保证。根据初步的统计，这些建议的提出和采用将使今年的生产超过原订指标约一百亿克朗。
