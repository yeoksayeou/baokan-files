    Using the Arrow of Marxism-Leninism to Shoot the Target of Actual Production
    Tianjin Workers Become Smarter Through Studying Philosophy
    Raising Awareness, Defending the General Line, and Promoting the Continued Leap Forward in Production
    (Our report) A mass movement of workers in Tianjin studying philosophy and the works of Chairman Mao has greatly developed over the past year or so.
    Starting in June 1958, on the basis of rectification and anti-rightist struggle, workers in Tianjin broke down superstitions, liberated their minds, and launched a mass movement to study philosophy and the works of Chairman Mao. In August of the same year, Comrade Kang Sheng, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, came to Tianjin and held a forum for veteran workers studying philosophy, which further clarified the guiding principles and great significance of the study, and this movement developed more vigorously. In March 1959, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC held a propaganda meeting, focusing on the issue of raising the level of study on the basis of popularization. Not only did the scale of study become more extensive, but many people also directly read the works of Chairman Mao and used Mao Zedong Thought to solve problems in their actual work, taking the study a step further. By the end of 1959, according to incomplete statistics from the six urban districts alone, more than 400,000 people had participated in the study. In addition to factory workers, many shop assistants and salespersons in the commercial system also participated.
    The most prominent feature of this study movement is its close integration of studying philosophy and Mao Zedong Thought with implementing and defending the General Line and promoting the Great Leap Forward in production. At the beginning of the study in 1958, the spirit of the Party's General Line for socialist construction was studied and comprehended, taking Chairman Mao's "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" as the guiding principles, which played a powerful role in promoting the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," technological innovation and technological revolution, and production leap forward in factories and enterprises at that time. In 1959, it was combined with the study of the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the anti-rightist struggle, the encouragement of vigor, and the mass movement to vigorously increase production and practice economy. Factories and enterprises generally and deeply studied and applied principles such as "starting from reality," "grasping objective laws and fully发挥主观能动性 (fāhuī zhǔguān néngdòngxìng - giving full play to subjective initiative)," "analyzing specific problems in specific ways," "grasping the main contradictions and solving key production issues," and "the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolution," thereby enhancing their understanding of the General Line and consciously defending and implementing the Party's line. For example, some people in the Renli Woolen Mill believed that "high speed cannot be efficient, high output cannot be high quality, and more and faster cannot be good and economical." Veteran workers studying philosophy used the facts of the mill's overall leap forward in production to illustrate that more, faster, better, and more economical are a unity of opposites. Although there are contradictions between them, they cannot be absolutized. One cannot only see the contradictory side but also the unified side. At the same time, the General Line is a whole; more, faster, better, and more economical must be linked with exerting full effort and striving for the upstream, and by fully发挥主观能动性 (fāhuī zhǔguān néngdòngxìng - giving full play to subjective initiative), it is possible to achieve both more and faster, and better and more economical. In this way, everyone more deeply realized the important significance of the General Line.
    Adhering to the principle of integrating theory with practice, learning and applying, and further learning in application, is another characteristic of this study movement. Their learning methods are all based on the principle of practice-theory-practice, combined with key issues in the movement and production, conducting free airing of views and debates, analyzing them from a philosophical perspective, and finding solutions. After the Food Factory No. 1 basically realized the mechanization of the entire factory, some people developed a feeling of "taking a breather." The factory immediately organized the study of the issue of "balance and imbalance." Through discussion, it was clarified that "balance is temporary and relative, while imbalance is constant and absolute, and it is necessary to advance the technological revolution to a new stage with the spirit of continuous revolution." After studying "On Contradiction," the workers in the barrel-making workshop paid attention to grasping the key issues in production, and as a result, they eliminated the "leaky barrel" accidents that had not been resolved since the factory was established thirty years ago. Workers wrote poems praising the study of Chairman Mao's works, saying: "Marxism-Leninism is the Sutra of Happiness, the more workers study, the smarter they become, just after a few lessons, their minds are like lit lamps."
    At present, Tianjin has initially formed a fairly extensive team of worker theorists. Each district and many factories have organized the backbone of the study in different forms, such as philosophy study classes, transmission stations, and research groups, to help them systematically study and improve, and through their learning and lecturing, they drive the study of the broad masses. Most of these backbone members are veteran workers who are familiar with production and the workers' thinking. Their lectures are practical, easy to understand, and very popular among workers. Li Changmao, a veteran worker from the Renli Woolen Mill, not only lectures in his own factory but also goes to other factories, government offices, and schools to lecture on philosophy. In the past year, he has lectured sixty times, with a total of more than 60,000 people attending his lectures.
    The mass movement of workers in Tianjin studying philosophy and theory was launched under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC and the Party committees at all levels. The Party committees at all levels vigorously publicized the significance of workers studying philosophy and gave enthusiastic support and help to the workers' study of philosophy. At the same time, they repeatedly emphasized the principle of integrating theory with practice, timely summarized and promoted experiences, grasped typical examples, and planted red flags, so that the experiences of advanced units such as the Renli Woolen Mill and the Food Factory No. 1 were quickly disseminated. In order to cultivate a group of study backbones, the Municipal Party Committee also opened veteran workers' spare-time philosophy study classes in the advanced cadres' self-study class, the Municipal Party School, and other places. The district committees, Party committees, and many factory Party committees are all headed by the secretaries, who often study this work. Many leading cadres have lectured to the workers. When studying the production situation and the ideological situation of cadres and workers in their factories, some factory Party committees also studied the issue of philosophy study, specified topics in light of the current situation, collectively prepared lessons, and respectively lectured to the workers.
    In order to further implement the Party's General Line and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the Tianjin Municipal Committee is preparing to launch a more extensive and in-depth movement to study Chairman Mao's works on the basis of socialist education.

### 用马克思列宁主义之矢射生产实际之的  天津工人学哲学越学越聪明  提高了觉悟，保卫了总路线，推动了生产继续跃进

    用马克思列宁主义之矢射生产实际之的
    天津工人学哲学越学越聪明
    提高了觉悟，保卫了总路线，推动了生产继续跃进
    本报讯　天津市工人学习哲学、学习毛主席著作的群众运动，一年多来有了很大发展。
    天津市工人，从1958年6月份开始，在整风和反右派的基础上，破除迷信，解放思想，掀起了一个学习哲学、学习毛主席著作的群众运动。同年8月份，中共中央政治局候补委员康生同志，来津召开了老工人学哲学座谈会后，进一步明确了学习的方针和重大意义，这一运动更加蓬勃地开展起来。1959年3月，中共天津市委召开了宣传会议，着重提出了在普及的基础上提高的问题，不仅学习的规模更加广泛，而且许多人都直接阅读毛主席的著作，运用毛主席的思想，解决实际工作中的问题，学习深入了一步。截至1959年底，仅根据市内六个区的不完全统计，参加学习的就有四十多万人。除了工厂职工外，商业系统的许多售货员、业务员，也都参加了学习。
    这一学习运动最突出的特点，就是把学习哲学、学习毛泽东思想和贯彻与保卫总路线、推动生产的大跃进紧密地结合了起来。1958年学习一开始，就是以毛主席的“实践论”、“矛盾论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”为纲，学习和领会党的社会主义建设总路线的精神，对于当时工厂企业的“两参一改三结合”、技术革新与技术革命和生产跃进起了有力的推动作用。1959年又和学习八届六中全会决议，八届八中全会决议，反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约的群众运动结合了起来。各工厂企业普遍深入地学习和运用了“从实际出发”、“掌握客观规律、充分发挥主观能动性”、“具体问题具体分析”、“抓住主要矛盾，解决生产关键”、“不断革命论与革命阶段论”等原理，提高了对于总路线的理解，自觉地保卫和贯彻了党的路线。如仁立毛呢厂有些人认为“高速不能高效，高产不能优质，多快不能好省”。学习哲学的老工人用本厂生产全面跃进的事实说明：多快好省是对立的统一，它们中间虽有矛盾，但不能绝对化，不能只看到它矛盾的一面，还要看到它统一的一面。同时总路线是一个整体，多快好省必须与鼓足干劲、力争上游联系起来，充分发挥主观能动性，就可以达到既多快又好省。这样，使大家更深刻地认识到总路线的重要意义。
    坚持理论联系实际的方针，学了就用，在用中进一步学，是这一学习运动的另一特点。他们的学习方法都是根据实际——理论——实际的原则，结合运动和生产中的关键问题，进行鸣放辩论，用哲学的观点加以分析，找出解决的办法。食品一厂基本实现了全厂的机械化以后，有些人滋长了“松一口气”的情绪。工厂立即组织了“平衡与不平衡”问题的学习，通过讨论，明确了“平衡是暂时的相对的，不平衡是经常的绝对的，必须以不断革命的精神，把技术革命推进到一个新的阶段”。这个厂制桶车间的职工，学习了“矛盾论”后，便注意抓生产中的关键问题，结果消灭了这个厂成立三十年以来没有解决的“漏桶”事故。工人们写诗歌颂学习毛主席的著作说：“马列主义幸福经，工人越学越聪明，刚刚上过几堂课，脑子就像点了灯。”
    目前，天津市已经初步形成了一支相当广泛的工人理论队伍。各区和许多工厂都以不同的形式，如哲学学习班、传授站、研究组等，将学习中的骨干组织了起来，帮助他们系统地学习和提高，并通过他们边学边讲，带动广大群众的学习。这些骨干分子，大部分是老工人，他们熟悉生产和工人的思想，讲课时联系实际，通俗易懂，很受工人欢迎。仁立毛呢厂老工人李长茂，不仅在本厂讲课，还到外厂和机关、学校中讲哲学。一年来，他讲了六十次课，听课的共有六万多人。
    天津市工人学哲学、学理论的群众运动，是在中共天津市委和各级党委领导下开展起来的。各级党委大力宣传工人学哲学的意义，并对工人学习哲学给予了热烈的支持和帮助。同时，反复地强调理论联系实际的方针，及时总结和推广经验，抓典型、插红旗，使仁立毛呢厂、食品一厂等先进单位的经验很快得到了传播。为了培养一批学习骨干，市委还在高干自修班、市委党校等处，开设了老工人业余哲学学习班。各区委、党委和许多工厂党委都是书记挂帅，经常研究这一工作。许多领导干部都给工人讲了课。有的厂党委在研究本厂的生产情况和干部、工人的思想情况时，同时也研究哲学学习的问题，针对当前情况，规定课题，集体备课，分别向工人讲授。
    为了进一步贯彻党的总路线，多快好省地建设社会主义，天津市委准备在社会主义教育的基础上，更广泛、更深入地开展学习毛主席著作的运动。
