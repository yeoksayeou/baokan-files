    Xinhua News Agency:
    The China Peace Committee sent a telegram on the 12th to the Japan Peace Committee and the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," expressing the Chinese people's full support for the Japanese people's upcoming eleventh national unified action against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the just struggle against Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States to sign the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The telegram also wished the Japanese people success in this struggle, hoping they could unite more peace-loving people who promote Sino-Japanese friendship, and make greater achievements in safeguarding Far East and world peace.
    The telegram stated that the Japanese people's nationwide struggle against the revision and for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" inflicted a heavy blow on the Kishida cabinet and U.S. imperialism through ten large-scale actions throughout 1959. The achievements of the Japanese people are not only a significant contribution to the cause of striving for Japanese independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, but also an important contribution to safeguarding Asian and world peace.
    The telegram pointed out, "The Kishida cabinet and U.S. imperialism, under the guise of revising the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' are forming an aggressive military alliance against the people of China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries. This is an important step in U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and expansion in Asia, and also a blatant manifestation of the revival of Japanese militarist forces represented by Nobusuke Kishi, relying on U.S. imperialism to re-invade and expand into Southeast Asia, and relive the old dream of the so-called 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.'"
    The telegram pointed out, "Faced with the powerful socialist camp and world peace forces, the U.S. government, on the one hand, has to feign some 'easing' and 'peaceful' gestures, attempting to use this to numb the people of the world; on the other hand, it is stepping up various war preparations, actively strengthening military blocs, intensifying the layout of atomic war base networks, and plotting new aggression conspiracies. The U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty about to be signed by U.S. imperialism and the Kishida cabinet, as well as the U.S.'s open declaration of the freedom to resume nuclear weapons testing, thoroughly expose the hideous face of U.S. imperialism, which pays lip service to peace but continues to exacerbate tensions and pursue a policy of war in essence."
    The telegram said that the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" will tie Japan tightly to the U.S. war chariot, drag the Japanese people into the abyss of war again, and bring serious threats to peace and security in the Far East. Therefore, it cannot but arouse fierce opposition from the people of Asia and the world. In particular, the Chinese people, who have suffered from the torment and aggression of Japanese militarism for sixty years, resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance. The Chinese people will never allow Japanese militarism, supported by U.S. imperialism, to come and harass the peaceful socialist construction of the motherland, nor will they allow the heinous Japanese militarism to invade Southeast Asian countries under the banner of anti-communism.
    The telegram said, "The Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance is an important part of the common cause of Asian and world people against aggression and in defense of peace. It has won the support of all peace-loving people in the world, especially the people of Asian countries and the Chinese people. We believe that with the widespread support of the people of Asia and the world, the Japanese people will further strengthen unity, persist in the struggle, overcome various difficulties, and achieve final victory. The Chinese people resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle and are willing to fight to the end with the Japanese people for the common cause of opposing U.S. imperialism's war of aggression policy and safeguarding Asian and world peace. The forces of peace and progress in the world are growing stronger day by day, and any form of war of aggression policy by U.S. imperialism and the Japanese Kishida clique will eventually be thoroughly bankrupt."
    The Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity sent a telegram on the 12th to the Japan Asian-African Solidarity Committee and the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," expressing firm support for the Japanese people's just struggle against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    The telegram pointed out that U.S. imperialism and the Kishida cabinet are reviving Japanese militarism by concluding a new military alliance treaty, further implementing their plans for war and aggression in Asia and Africa.
    The telegram said, "U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarists are doing so, seriously damaging the interests of the Japanese nation and greatly threatening peace in Asia, Africa, and the world. The peace-loving people of the world, especially the people of Asian countries who have suffered the ravages of Japanese militarism in the Second World War, will never sit idly by and watch the realization of this conspiracy by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries."
    The telegram said that the Chinese people have always sympathized with the Japanese people's good wishes to get rid of U.S. imperialism's control, realize Japan's independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, restore normal relations with China, and live in friendship and peace with the people of Asia, Africa, and the world. The Chinese people believe that these demands and wishes not only conform to the true interests of the Japanese people but also conform to the interests of the people of Asian and African countries. The Japanese people's struggle against the revision and for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, and against the revival of Japanese militarism will not only receive the firm support of the Chinese people but also will surely receive the strong support of the people of Asian and African countries.
    The telegram said, "We firmly believe that the Japanese people, who have already achieved great results in last year's struggle, will surely advance with more resolute steps and valiantly strike a more powerful blow to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries in this struggle, and achieve greater victories in the cause of striving for Japanese national independence and safeguarding peace in Asia, Africa, and the world."
    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram on the 12th to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," saying: "We, on behalf of all Chinese workers, express our warm support for the eleventh national unified action of people from all walks of life in Japan against the revision of the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty.'"
    The telegram said: The Chinese workers have always watched with admiration the heroic struggle of the Japanese working class and the broad masses of Japanese people against the revision and for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The Chinese workers have always sympathized with the Japanese people's ardent desire to take the road of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and to improve Sino-Japanese relations and restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Since last year, the Japanese working class and people from all walks of life in Japan have successively launched ten national unified actions against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Your struggle has dealt a powerful blow to the conspiracy of the Kishida cabinet and U.S. imperialism to collude with each other and revive Japanese militarism, and has made a great contribution to maintaining Japanese national independence and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. In these struggles, we are pleased to see that the strength of the Japanese people has become increasingly united and strong and is forming a broad united front. The Kishida cabinet has been in an unprecedentedly isolated situation under the unanimous opposition of people from all walks of life.
    The telegram said: At present, the Kishida cabinet, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, despite the strong opposition of the broad masses of the Japanese people, has stubbornly persisted in going to the United States to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and sign a U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty aimed at turning Japan into a U.S. base for aggression and an accomplice. This fact fully proves that the Kishida cabinet is determined to be an enemy of the Japanese people, the Chinese and Soviet people, and the people of Asian countries. At the same time, it completely exposes that the "peaceful" posture recently played by U.S. imperialism is entirely a deceptive trick.
    The telegram said: Under such circumstances, the eleventh national unified action of people from all walks of life in Japan against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has special and significant meaning. We know that the Japanese people's struggle is arduous, but the Japanese people are by no means isolated, and all peace-loving people in the world stand by your side. The Chinese workers and all Chinese people will give full support to your struggle. We firmly believe that U.S. imperialism will one day be driven out of Japan, the reactionary policy of the Kishida cabinet will be completely bankrupt, and the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will surely achieve final victory.
    The All-China Women's Federation sent a telegram on the 12th to the Federation of Japanese Women's Organizations and the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," expressing the firm support of all Chinese women for the struggle of the Japanese people and women against Kishida's visit to the United States to sign the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty against the people of China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries, and firmly believes that their heroic struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance and for Japan's independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will surely achieve final victory.
    The telegram said that Kishida, disregarding the opposition of the Japanese people and peace-loving people all over the world, has formed a military alliance with the United States, stepped up the revival of Japanese militarism, antagonized China and the Soviet Union, and attempted to re-invade and expand into Southeast Asia, reliving the old dream of Japanese militarism. The revival of Japanese militarism and the U.S.-Japan military alliance will inevitably bring endless disasters to the Japanese people, especially Japanese women and children. The realization of this conspiracy by U.S. imperialism and Kishida will not only further place Japan in a position of enmity with the people of Asian countries but will also seriously threaten peace in Asia and the world.
    The telegram pointed out that the U.S. government is now trying its best to disguise itself as willing to be "peaceful" in appearance in order to deceive the people of the world, but in reality, it is stepping up preparations for aggression and war, accelerating the formation of military blocs, accelerating the manufacture of missile weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and has recently openly announced its readiness to resume nuclear weapons testing. This nakedly exposes that the United States is a fierce eagle wearing dove feathers. However, Kishida is willing to sacrifice the interests of the Japanese nation and the fate of the Japanese people as the price to revive Japanese militarism and form an alliance with this fierce eagle, and must make Japan an accomplice in the new war plans of the United States, in fact, driving the Japanese people to be cannon fodder for the United States.
    The telegram said that the Japanese people suffered deeply from the disasters of Japanese militarism in World War II, and after the war, they were devastated and oppressed by U.S. imperialism. Especially the broad masses of Japanese women who suffered the most, in the U.S.-Japan military alliance of U.S. imperialism and Kishida, they saw the shadow of war disasters re-emerging before their eyes, so they unanimously rose up and resolutely opposed the revival of Japanese militarism and the U.S.-Japan military alliance. The Japanese people have achieved great achievements in the struggles that have been rising one after another since last year, expanded the ranks of the struggle, strengthened unity, and are carrying out greater struggles against the U.S.-Japan military alliance with a more resolute attitude.
    The telegram finally said, "Japanese sisters, your struggle is not isolated. Standing with you are the powerful peace forces of the people of the world. Chinese women, who have suffered under the invasion of Japanese militarism, resolutely oppose Kishida's revival of Japanese militarism, resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance, and resolutely oppose the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to harm peace in Asia and the world. All Chinese women have always supported and will continue to support your just struggle. We firmly believe that U.S. imperialism and Kishida, who are determined to drag Japan onto the road of aggressive war, like other war criminals in history, will eventually reap what they sow."
    The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation sent a telegram on the 12th to the Japan Democratic Youth League and the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," representing 130 million Chinese youth and students, once again expressing their full support for the large-scale struggle launched by the Japanese people and youth and students against the signing of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    The telegram said that since last year, the ten national unified actions continuously carried out by the Japanese people against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" have been larger in scale and stronger in momentum each time, showing the Japanese people's firm determination and great strength to fight for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. Your heroic actions have won widespread sympathy and support from the Chinese people, Asia, and the peace-loving people of the world.
    The telegram said that the Kishida cabinet, which is willing to rely on the United States, completely disregarded the will of the Japanese people and decided to forcibly sign the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and insisted on imposing the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance, which is hostile to China and the Soviet Union, on the Japanese people. The deep disasters that Japanese militarism launched aggressive wars and brought to the Japanese nation in the last World War are still tormenting many Japanese people and youth today, and the Kishida cabinet is even trying to rely on the United States to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism and lead Japan back to the road of aggression and war. Such perverse actions by U.S. imperialism and Kishida will not only expose their true colors more thoroughly in front of the people, inspire the people's more firm fighting spirit, and thus make themselves move more quickly towards destruction, but will have no other results.
    The telegram finally said, "Japanese youth friends: You shoulder the future of the motherland. The realization of a new Japan that is independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral is closely related to your own future. We firmly believe that Japanese youth and students, who have always actively participated in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' will continue to work with the broad masses of Japanese people to strengthen unity and unified action, and persevere with full confidence in carrying out the heroic struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance and for Sino-Japanese friendship. No difficulties can stop the Japanese people and youth from moving forward, and victory must belong to you!"
    The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries sent a telegram on the 12th to the Japan-China Friendship Association and the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," expressing firm support for the eleventh national unified action launched by the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to oppose the revision and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    The telegram said: The ten national unified actions held by the Japanese people for this purpose in 1959 have achieved great results and have dealt a serious blow to U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism and its representative, Kishida. At the beginning of this new year, when Kishida is about to go to the United States to sign the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the Japanese people have launched the eleventh national unified action with high morale, which is even more meaningful.
    The telegram said: At the beginning of the new year, when the Japanese people are taking new steps in the struggle for national independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, the Chinese people wish the Japanese people greater achievements in this just struggle.
    The telegram pointed out that the U.S.-Japan military alliance planned by U.S. imperialism and the Kishida cabinet is an important step for U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism under its support to carry out aggression and expansion in the Far East. This conspiracy once again tore off the mask of false peace of U.S. imperialism and nakedly exposed its consistently adhered war policy. At the same time, it also fully revealed that the Kishida cabinet, in order to safeguard the interests of a few Japanese monopoly capital, disregarded the opposition of the Japanese people, revived Japanese militarism, and attempted to realize its ambition of "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." If this conspiracy succeeds, it will not only drag the Japanese nation into the abyss of destruction but also seriously threaten peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, the Japanese people's struggle is by no means isolated, and it will inevitably receive unanimous sympathy and support from the peace-loving people all over the world.
    The telegram pointed out: "The people of China and Japan have common interests in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance and against the revival of Japanese militarism. The development of this struggle has an important impact on how Sino-Japanese relations will develop in the future. The signing of the new U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' is a major obstacle set by U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Kishida cabinet for further improving Sino-Japanese relations. But we are pleased to see that the Japanese people are holding high the banner of Sino-Japanese friendship, improving Sino-Japanese relations, and restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, which is in full compliance with the common aspirations of the people of China and Japan and the common interests of safeguarding peace in Asia."
    The telegram said: "We firmly believe that the Japanese patriotic and democratic forces will become more united, more determined, and stronger in the future struggle. Under the surging and powerful just struggle of the Chinese and Japanese people who love peace, unity, and friendship, any perverse acts of the U.S.-Japan reactionary forces will eventually be shamefully defeated."
    Ten literary and art organizations in China jointly sent a telegram on the 12th to the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association and the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," expressing support for the Japanese people's struggle against the signing of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    The telegram said that the Japanese people, who are holding high the banner of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, have set off a new climax of struggle with a surging momentum at the beginning of 1960, and have fiercely attacked U.S. imperialism and the Kishida cabinet, which are pushing Japan into the abyss of militarist revival and war disasters. The struggle against Kishida's signing of a U.S.-Japan military alliance with the United States in the name of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" concentratedly reflects the common will of all Japanese people who oppose the revival of Japanese militarism, have peaceful aspirations, and are patriotic. We, all Chinese literary and art workers, love peace, oppose aggression, oppose war, oppose the revival of Japanese militarism, and even more oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance that carries out aggression and prepares for war. All those who oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and the U.S.-Japan military alliance are our comrades-in-arms. The battles of our comrades-in-arms are our own battles. We express our lofty respect and firm support to the Japanese people in the heroic struggle.
    The telegram said that we are particularly concerned about the important role played by friends in the Japanese cultural circles in the great struggle of the Japanese people. We have seen that Japanese cultural figures with patriotism and a sense of justice are increasingly widely joining the ranks of the Japanese people's struggle against the revival of militarism and against the U.S.-Japan military alliance. They use their pens, their language, and all literary and artistic means to serve the current noble cause of the Japanese people and strive for Japan's independence and democracy, peace, and neutrality. We pay tribute to the friends in the Japanese cultural circles who are fighting gloriously in the ranks of the Japanese people's struggle.
    The telegram said that we, the Chinese people, we Chinese literary and art workers, together with the peace-loving people and literary and art workers all over the world, express our firm support for the Japanese people's strong and unyielding will and actions of struggle, and believe that as long as the Japanese people unite closely and fight on indomitably, they will surely achieve final victory.
    The organizations that jointly sent the cable are: China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Chinese Writers Association, Chinese Dramatists Association, China Musicians Association, Chinese Artists Association, Chinese Ballad Singers Association, Chinese Folk Literature Research Association, Chinese Dance Research Association, China Film Workers Association, and Chinese Photographers Association.

    我国各人民团体致电全力支持日本人民第十一次统一行动
    日本人民争取独立民主的事业一定胜利
    美国总有一天要被赶出日本，岸信介执行反动政策必将自食恶果
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会  12日打电报给日本和平委员会和日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，表示中国人民完全支持日本人民即将举行第十一次反对修改日美“安全条约”全国统一行动反对岸信介去美国签订日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。电报并预祝日本人民在这一次斗争中能够团结更多的爱好和平、促进中日友好的人们，为着保卫远东和世界和平作出更大的成就。
    电报说，日本人民反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的全民性斗争，在1959年全年中，通过声势浩大的十次行动，给予了岸信介政府和美帝国主义以沉重的打击。日本人民取得的成就，不仅是对争取日本独立、民主、和平、中立事业的重大贡献，而且也是保卫亚洲和世界和平的重要贡献。
    电报指出，“岸信介政府和美帝国主义以修改日美‘安全条约’为名，结成以中国、苏联和亚洲各国人民为敌的侵略性军事同盟，这是美帝国主义在亚洲推行侵略扩张政策的一个重要步骤，也是以岸信介为代表的日本军国主义势力依附美帝国主义复活、向东南亚再度进行侵略扩张、重温所谓‘大东亚共荣圈’旧梦的露骨表现。”
    电报指出，“美国政府在强大的社会主义阵营和世界和平力量面前，一方面不得不装扮出一些‘缓和’以及‘和平’姿态，企图借以麻痹世界人民；另一方面则加紧进行各种战争准备，积极加强军事集团，加紧布置原子战争基地网，策划新的侵略阴谋。美帝国主义和岸信介政府即将签订的日美军事同盟条约以及美国公然宣布有恢复核武器试验自由的事实，就彻底暴露了美帝国主义口头上侈谈和平、实质上继续加剧紧张局势和推行战争政策的狰狞面目。”
    电报说，新的日美“安全条约”将把日本紧缚在美国的战车上，再度把日本人民拖入战争的深渊，并且将给远东的和平和安全带来严重的威胁。因此，它不能不引起亚洲人民以及世界各国人民的激烈反对。尤其是遭受日本军国主义折磨侵略达六十年之久的中国人民，坚决反对日美军事同盟。中国人民断不能容许美帝国主义扶持下的日本军国主义重来侵扰祖国的和平的社会主义建设，也不能容许万恶的日本军国主义假反共的旗帜去侵略东南亚各国。
    电报说，“日本人民反对美日军事同盟的斗争，是亚洲和世界人民反对侵略、保卫和平的共同事业中一个重要部分，它获得全世界一切爱好和平的人民，特别是亚洲各国人民和中国人民的支持。我们相信，在亚洲和全世界人民的广泛支持下，日本人民一定会进一步加强团结，坚持斗争，突破各种困难，直到取得最后胜利。中国人民坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争，并愿同日本人民一起，为反对美帝国主义战争侵略政策和保卫亚洲和世界和平的共同事业奋斗到底。全世界和平进步的力量正日益壮大，美帝国主义和日本岸信介集团任何形式的战争侵略政策，都终将遭到彻底的破产。”
    中国亚非团结委员会  12日打电报给日本亚非团结委员会和日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，表示坚决支持日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的正义斗争。
    电报指出，美帝国主义和岸信介政府已在通过缔结新的军事同盟条约复活日本军国主义，进一步在亚非推行战争和侵略的计划。
    电报说，“美帝国主义和日本军国主义者这样做，严重地损害了日本民族的利益，大大威胁着亚非和世界和平。全世界爱好和平的人民，尤其在第二次大战中受尽日本军国主义荼毒的亚洲各国人民，是决不会坐视美日反动派的这一阴谋的实现的。”
    电报说，中国人民一贯同情日本人民摆脱美帝国主义的控制，实现日本的独立、民主、和平和中立，和中国恢复正常关系，与亚非和世界各国人民友好和平相处的善良愿望。中国人民认为这些要求和愿望，不仅符合日本人民的真正利益，也符合亚非各国人民的利益。日本人民反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”反对美日军事同盟反对日本军国主义复活的斗争，不仅会得到中国人民的坚决支持，也必将得到亚非各国人民的大力支持。
    电报说，“我们深信，在去年的斗争中已经取得伟大成绩的日本人民，在这次斗争中一定能以更坚决的步伐，英勇前进，更有力地打击美日反动派，在争取日本民族独立和保卫亚非与世界和平的事业中，取得更大的胜利。”
    中华全国总工会  12日打电报给日本工会总评议会和日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议说：“我们代表全体中国工人，对于日本各界人民即将举行的反对修改日美‘安全条约’的第十一次全国统一行动，表示热烈的支持。”
    电报说：中国工人一向怀着敬佩的心情，注视着日本工人阶级和广大日本人民为反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”而进行的英勇斗争。中国工人一向同情日本人民要求走独立、民主、和平、中立道路，以及要求改善中日关系、恢复中日邦交的热烈愿望。自去年以来，日本工人阶级和日本各阶层人民一起，先后掀起了十次反对修改日美“安全条约”的全国统一行动。你们的斗争，对于岸信介政府和美帝国主义互相勾结，复活日本军国主义的阴谋，给予了有力的打击，对于维护日本民族独立，维护远东和世界和平，作出了巨大的贡献。在这些斗争中，我们高兴地看到，日本人民的力量已经日益团结和壮大，并且正在形成广泛的统一战线。岸信介政府在各阶层人民的一致反对下，已经陷于空前孤立的境地。
    电报说：目前，岸信介政府在美帝国主义的指使下，不顾日本广大人民的强烈反对，竟然一意孤行，坚持要去美国修改日美“安全条约”，签订旨在使日本变成美国侵略基地和帮凶的日美军事同盟条约。这一事实，充分证明了岸信介政府决心要同日本人民、中国和苏联人民以及亚洲各国人民为敌，同时，也彻底暴露了美帝国主义最近以来所扮演的“和平”姿态，完全是一种骗人的把戏。
    电报说：在这种情况下，日本各界人民即将举行的反对修改日美“安全条约”的第十一次全国统一行动，就具有特别重大的意义。我们知道，日本人民的斗争是艰巨的，但是日本人民决不是孤立的，全世界一切爱好和平的人民都站在你们一边。中国工人和全体中国人民更将全力支持你们的斗争。我们深信，美帝国主义总有一天要被赶出日本，岸信介政府的反动政策必将遭到完全的破产，日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争一定要取得最后胜利。
    中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会  12日打电报给日本妇女团体联合会和日本人民阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，表示全中国妇女坚决支持日本人民和妇女反对岸信介到美国去签订以中苏和亚洲各国人民为敌的日美军事同盟条约的斗争，并且深信他们反对日美军事同盟和为争取日本独立、民主、和平、中立而进行的英勇斗争必将取得最后胜利。
    电报说，岸信介不顾日本人民和全世界爱好和平人民的反对，与美国结成军事同盟，加紧复活日本军国主义，敌视中苏两国并企图再度向东南亚进行侵略扩张，重温日本军国主义的旧梦。日本军国主义复活和日美军事同盟的结果，必然给日本人民，首先给日本妇女和儿童带来无穷的灾难。美帝国主义和岸信介这个阴谋的实现，不但将进一步地把日本置于同亚洲各国人民为敌的地位，而且将严重地威胁亚洲和世界的和平。
    电报指出，现在，美国政府竭力在表面上把自己打扮成愿意“和平”的样子，以欺骗世界人民的耳目，实际上，却一步紧似一步地进行侵略和战争的准备，加紧拼凑军事集团，加紧制造导弹武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，最近更公然宣布准备恢复核武器试验。这就赤裸裸地暴露了美国是一只披着鸽子羽毛的凶鹰。但是岸信介却甘心以牺牲日本民族的利益和日本人民的命运为代价，复活日本军国主义，同这只凶鹰结成同盟，一定要使日本在美国的新战争策划中充当帮凶，实际上是驱使日本人民替美国当炮灰。
    电报说，日本人民在二次大战中遭受日本军国主义的深重灾难，战后又饱受美帝国主义蹂躏、压迫，特别是痛苦最深的日本广大妇女，在美帝国主义和岸信介的美日军事同盟中看到了再度浮现在她们眼前的战争灾难的阴影，因此他们一致奋起，坚决地反对日本军国主义复活和美日军事同盟。日本人民在去年以来，直到现在，一浪高一浪的斗争中取得了很大的成就，壮大了斗争的队伍，加强了团结，并且正以更坚决的姿态开展更大的反对美日军事同盟的斗争。
    电报最后说，“日本的姐妹们，你们的斗争不是孤立的。同你们站在一起的是全世界人民强大的和平力量。在日本军国主义侵略下受尽了折磨的中国妇女，坚决反对岸信介复活日本军国主义，坚决反对美日军事同盟，坚决反对美日反动派危害亚洲和世界和平的阴谋活动。全中国妇女一向支持、今后仍将继续支持你们的正义斗争。我们深信，一心把日本拖上侵略战争的道路的美帝国主义和岸信介，是和历史上其他战争罪犯一样，终将自食其果的。”
    中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会12日打电报给日本民主青年同盟和日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，代表一亿三千万中国青年和学生再次表示全力支持日本人民和青年学生为反对签订新日美“安全条约”而展开的大规模斗争。
    电报说，去年以来，日本人民为反对修改日美“安全条约”连续进行的十次全国统一行动，规模一次比一次大，气势一次比一次壮，显示出日本人民为争取独立、民主、和平中立而斗争的坚强决心和巨大力量。你们的英勇行动，赢得了中国人民、亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民的广泛同情和支持。
    电报说，但是甘心投靠美国的岸信介政府却根本不顾日本人民的意志，竟然决定强行签订新的日美“安全条约”，硬要把以中、苏为敌的侵略性日美军事同盟强加在日本人民的头上。日本军国主义发动侵略战争和在上次世界大战中带给日本民族的深重灾难，今天还仍然在折磨着许多日本人民和青年，而岸信介政府竟又妄图依靠美国来加速复活日本军国主义，把日本重新引向侵略和战争的道路。美帝国主义和岸信介的这种倒行逆施，除了在人民面前更彻底地揭露自己的真面貌，激发人民更加坚定的斗志、从而使自己更迅速地走向灭亡以外，不会有其他的结果。
    电报最后说，“日本的青年朋友们：你们肩负着祖国的未来，实现一个独立、民主与和平中立的新日本，和你们自己的前途有着密切的关系。我们坚信，一贯积极参加反对日美‘安全条约’斗争的日本青年和学生，必将继续同广大日本人民一道，加强团结和统一行动，信心百倍地坚持开展反对日美军事同盟、争取中日友好的英勇斗争。任何困难都将阻挡不了日本人民和青年的前进步伐，胜利必定是属于你们的！”
    中国人民对外文化协会  12日打电报给日中友好协会和日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，表示坚决支持日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议为反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”所发动的第十一次全国统一行动。
    电报说：1959年日本人民为此目的所举行的十次全国统一行动，已取得巨大的成绩，给予了美帝国主义和日本军国主义以及其代表岸信介以严重的打击。在这新的一年开始，当岸信介即将赴美签订新的日美“安全条约”的时候，日本人民又斗志昂扬地发动第十一次全国统一行动，就更显得具有特别重大的意义。
    电报说：在新的一年的开头，当日本人民为争取民族独立、民主、和平中立的斗争迈开新的步伐的时候，中国人民祝日本人民在这一正义斗争中取得更大的成就。
    电报指出，美帝国主义和岸信介政府所策划的日美军事同盟是美帝及其扶持下的日本军国主义在远东进行侵略扩张的一个重要步骤。这一阴谋活动又一次揭下了美帝国主义的假和平面具，赤裸裸地暴露了它一贯坚持的战争政策。同时，也充分揭露了岸信介政府为了维护少数日本垄断资本的利益，不顾日本人民的反对，复活日本军国主义，妄图实现其“大东亚共荣圈”的野心。这一阴谋如果得逞，不仅会把日本民族拖入毁灭的深渊，而且也严重地威胁着亚洲和世界和平。因此，日本人民的斗争决不是孤立的，它必将得到全世界爱好和平的人民一致的同情和支持。
    电报指出：“中日两国人民在反对日美军事同盟、反对日本军国主义复活的斗争中有着共同的利益，中日两国关系今后将如何开展，这一斗争的发展是有重要影响的。新的日美‘安全条约’的签订是美帝国主义和反动的岸信介政府为进一步改善中日关系设置的一个重大的障碍。但是我们高兴地看到日本人民在反对美日军事同盟的斗争中高举中日友好，改善中日关系和恢复中日邦交的旗帜，这是完全符合中日两国人民的共同愿望和保卫亚洲和平的共同利益的。”
    电报说：“我们深信，日本爱国民主力量在今后的斗争中必将更加团结，更加坚决，更加壮大。在汹涌澎湃的中日两国人民爱好和平、团结友好的正义斗争下，任何日美反动势力的倒行逆施，最终必将遭到可耻的失败。”
    中国文学艺术界十个团体  12日联合打电报给日中文化交流协会和日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，表示支持日本人民反对签订新的日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    电报说，高举独立、民主、和平、中立旗帜的日本人民，在1960年开始的时候，以汹涌澎湃之势掀起了一个新的斗争高潮，向把日本推入军国主义复活和战争灾难深渊的美帝国主义和岸信介政府猛烈冲击。反对岸信介在修改日美“安全条约”名义下同美国签订日美军事同盟的斗争，集中地反映着一切反对日本军国主义复活、具有和平愿望和爱国心的日本人民的共同意志。我们全中国的文学艺术工作者酷爱和平，反对侵略，反对战争，反对日本军国主义的复活，更反对进行侵略、准备战争的美日军事同盟。所有反对日本军国主义复活和美日军事同盟的都是我们的战友，我们的战友的战斗就是我们自己的战斗，我们向英勇斗争中的日本人民表示崇高的敬意和坚决的支持。
    电报说，我们特别关切地注意到日本文化界的朋友们在日本人民伟大的斗争中所起的重要作用。我们看到，具有爱国心和正义感的日本文化界人士越来越广泛地加入了日本人民反对军国主义复活和反对美日军事同盟的斗争行列。他们用笔，用语言，用一切文艺手段服务于当前日本人民的崇高事业，争取日本的独立和民主、和平和中立。我们向光荣地站在日本人民斗争行列中战斗着的日本文化界的朋友们致以敬意。
    电报说，我们中国人民，我们中国文学艺术工作者，和全世界爱好和平的人民和文学艺术工作者一起，对于日本人民坚强不屈的斗争意志和行动，表示坚决支持，并且相信：只要日本人民紧密团结、百折不挠地斗争下去，必将取得最后的胜利。
    联合打电报的团体是：中国文学艺术界联合会、中国作家协会、中国戏剧家协会、中国音乐家协会、中国美术家协会、中国曲艺工作者协会、中国民间文艺研究会、中国舞蹈艺术研究会、中国电影工作者联谊会、中国摄影学会。
