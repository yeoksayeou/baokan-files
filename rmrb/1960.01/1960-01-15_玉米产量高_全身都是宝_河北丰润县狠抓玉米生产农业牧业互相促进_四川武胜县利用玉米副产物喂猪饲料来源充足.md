　　Hebei's Fengrun County uses a large amount of corn as livestock feed, which has led to the rapid development of animal husbandry production in the county.

　　Fengrun County is rich in corn, with corn acreage accounting for about one-third of the total area of food crops each year. Due to the high yield of corn, its total harvest accounts for 40% to 50% of the total grain output. Planting a variety of corn provides abundant fine and coarse feed for raising a large number of livestock. To date, Fengrun County's stock of pigs has reached more than 240,000, an increase of 44.4% over 1958, more than double that of 1956, and more than seven times that of the early post-liberation period; there has also been great development in large livestock. With more livestock, especially pigs, there is also more fertilizer, and the speed of grain production has been rapid. In the early post-liberation period, the average grain yield per mu in this county was only about 80 jin. In 1956, it increased to 346 jin, and in 1958, it achieved the 400 jin target stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, reaching 430 jin. In 1959, although 500,000 mu of crops in the county were affected by disasters, the harvest was still higher than in 1958, with an average yield of 450 jin per mu. Among them, the growth rate of corn was particularly prominent, with an average yield of 600 jin per mu, and many high-yield fields with more than 1,000 jin appeared, with a total output increase of 26% compared with 1958.

　　Judging from the situation in Fengrun County, corn truly deserves to be called the "king of feed." It has a high yield and a high utilization rate. From the corn cobs to the husks and stalks, they have all become livestock feed. According to the current average yield per mu of corn in this county, calculating that each pig eats 100 jin to 120 jin of fine feed, in addition to feeding six to ten pigs per mu, the corn cobs, husks, and stalks can also be processed into feed. For example, the cobs, husks, and the lower sections of the thick and fat stalks can be dried, ground into flour, and each mu can produce more than 500 jin of coarse feed, enough to fatten a pig (this feed tastes sweet and pigs love to eat it); the upper sections of the stalks can be used as silage or dry feed for large livestock. At present, all large-scale pig farms and many production teams in the county have feed processing equipment such as drying ovens and pulverizers. Because this county has found a good way to solve the feed problem by planting a large amount of corn, in the one-year period from September 1958 to September 1959, corn accounted for more than 80% of the more than 100 million jin of coarse feed needed to feed 200,000 pigs in the county.

　　Although the masses in Fengrun County have a habit of planting corn, the use of corn as livestock feed, especially for feeding pigs, started in 1956. In the past, because the feed problem had not been well resolved, although the masses knew the benefits of raising pigs to fertilize the fields, they were worried that if they had pigs, they would have nothing to feed them, and the development of pig raising was very slow. In 1956, the county party committee discovered that pig-raising expert Peng Huawang had achieved very good results using corn cobs, husks, and stalks to feed pigs. Therefore, it vigorously promoted throughout the county that the entire corn plant could be used as feed, as well as its advantages of high yield and strong disaster resistance, dispelling people's saying that "pigs are always hungry and cannot be raised." Since then, a new situation of increasing corn planting and raising a large number of pigs has emerged in the county.

　　In order to ensure high yields and large harvests of corn, Fengrun County conscientiously implemented measures to increase production, such as deep plowing, irrigation, superior varieties, close planting, hybridization, pest control, and artificial pollination, in the process of planting corn. In view of the fact that corn accounts for a large proportion of the county's food crops, the county party committee has particularly strengthened its leadership over corn production. From the county to the production team, a secretary is in charge of corn production, and many production teams have also established corn planting technology research groups to cultivate high-yield models and summarize and promote the experience of bumper harvests.

　　In order to adapt to the new situation of the continued great leap forward in agricultural production and the high-speed development of pig raising, the Fengrun County Party Committee has made plans and arrangements for further large-scale development of pig raising and solving the required feed in 1960. This year, the county plans to raise 1.4 million pigs, requiring a total of 140 million jin to 160 million jin of fine feed and more than 700 million jin of coarse feed. The county party committee stipulates that 1.5 fen of feed land should be reserved for each pig, mainly to solve the problem of fine feed; in addition, measures should be taken to plant a variety of corn to solve the problem of coarse feed. The county plans to plant 510,000 mu of corn, an increase of 75.8% over 1959; it plans to achieve a yield of 800 jin per mu, an increase of 33.3% over 1959. In this way, one-third to one-half of the coarse feed required by the county's pigs can be solved. At the same time, according to the situation that the Fangfang (i.e., high-yield square) has a pig farm, each high-yield square must plant a certain amount of corn and have processing equipment such as dry ovens and pulverizers, so that wherever the pigs are, the feed is there, so as to supply and accumulate fertilizer locally.

　　Xinhua News Agency reports:
　　Sichuan's famous corn-producing county, Wusheng, although suffered a severe drought in 1959 that had not been seen in more than 20 years, the average yield per mu of the county's more than 27,400 mu of corn still reached as high as 817 jin. Among them, more than 12,600 mu of early corn reached an average yield of 1,201 jin, an increase of 20% compared with the great leap forward year of 1958.

　　Corn is a food crop in Wusheng County second only to rice and sweet potatoes. In long-term practice, this county has found that planting corn has many benefits: ① High yield. In 1959, the average yield per mu of early corn was more than twice that of small spring crops and 38% higher than that of rice; ② Rapid and large increase in production speed and range. In recent years, the average yield per mu of corn in Wusheng County has been increasing at a rate of 20% to 30% per year; ③ Strong adaptability. Corn can be planted and obtain high yields regardless of mountains, plains, field ridges, field edges, sandy soil, yellow mud or other soil types; ④ Not prone to diseases and insect pests. The yield is relatively stable; ⑤ Easy to intercrop and interplant with food crops such as sweet potatoes, giving full play to the potential of the land. In 1959, the total output of sweet potatoes intercropped and interplanted in corn fields in the county reached more than 50 million jin.

　　Due to the above advantages of corn production, Wusheng County has always paid close attention to the leadership of corn production. First, it fully implements the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture. More than 27,000 mu of corn in the county were generally deep-plowed to a depth of one to two feet, and the soil layer was thickened. More than 20,000 jin of base fertilizer were applied per mu. Corn varieties such as Jin Huanghou and Baima Ya were selected for different regions, and reasonable close planting was implemented. The planting time was also more than ten days earlier than in 1958. In addition, advanced measures such as timely topdressing to attack seedlings, stalks, ears, and seeds, and promoting artificial pollination were taken to promote large ears, many grains, and heavy grains of corn to ensure high yields.

　　In order to strengthen leadership, Wusheng County established a corn production office, and there were dedicated personnel in charge at the county, district, commune, management area, and production team levels. With the county party secretary as the head, cadres and masses in the county also established more than 10,000 mu of corn command areas and high-yield areas to create experience and guide large-scale bumper harvests.

　　The development of corn production has brought many benefits to Wusheng County. First, it increased grain production. In 1959, Wusheng County's corn planting area was only more than 27,000 mu, but the total output reached 22.43 million jin. The wheat planting area was more than four times that of corn, but the total output was only 1.2 times more than that of corn. Second, the development of corn production provided a large amount of high-quality feed for the development of animal husbandry. Corn cobs, corn husks, corn leaves, and corn stalks all contain a large amount of starch, sugar, and other rich nutrients, which can be used as silage or dry feed. The first breeding farm of the Wusheng County Commercial Bureau once used silage corn stalks and dried and finely ground corn cobs to feed pigs separately. The average daily weight gain was 12 liang, which was faster than pigs fed with rapeseed hulls, peanut hulls, and other feeds. In 1959, the county provided a total of more than 56 million jin of high-quality feed such as corn cobs, corn husks, corn leaves, and corn stalks, which could feed 22,500 pigs for one year.

　　In 1960, Wusheng County plans to plant 60,000 mu of corn, an increase of more than double that of 1959.

    玉米产量高　全身都是宝
    河北丰润县狠抓玉米生产农业牧业互相促进
    四川武胜县利用玉米副产物喂猪饲料来源充足
    本报讯　河北丰润县大量采用玉米作牲畜饲料，使全县畜牧业生产得到迅速发展。
    丰润县盛产玉米，每年玉米播种面积约占粮食作物总面积的三分之一。由于玉米产量高，它的总收获量占粮食总产量的40％至50％。多种玉米就为大量饲养牲畜提供了丰富的精、粗饲料。到目前止，丰润县存栏猪已达到二十四万多头，比1958增加了44．4％，比1956年增加了一倍多，比解放初增加了七倍多；大牲口也有了很大发展。牲畜特别是猪多了，肥也多了，粮食增产速度很快。解放初期，这个县的粮食平均亩产只有八十斤左右，1956年增加到三百四十六斤，1958年就提前实现了农业发展纲要规定的四百斤的指标，达到了四百三十斤；1959年，虽然全县有五十万亩作物受灾，仍然获得了高于1958年的收成，平均亩产四百五十斤。其中，玉米的增长速度尤其突出，平均亩产达到六百斤，并出现了不少千斤以上的丰产田，总产量比1958年增长了26％。
    从丰润县的情况看，玉米真不愧为“饲料之王”。它的产量大，利用率高，从玉米轴到皮和秸秆，都成了牲畜的粮草。按目前这个县的玉米平均亩产量，以每头猪喂一百斤至一百二十斤精饲料计算，一亩玉米除喂养六头至十头猪以外，还可以把玉米轴、皮和秸秆都加工作饲料。如将轴、皮和又粗又肥的秸秆下半节，烘干磨成面，每亩地可出五百多斤粗饲料，足够喂肥一头猪（这种饲料味道香甜，猪爱吃）；秸秆的上半节可以作青贮饲料或干饲料，作为大牲口的饲草。现在，全县所有大型养猪场和不少生产队，都有烘干炉、粉碎机等饲料加工设备。由于这个县找到了大种玉米解决饲料的好办法，全县从1958年9月至1959年9月的一个年度内，喂养二十万头猪所需的一亿多斤粗饲料中，玉米就占了80％以上。
    丰润县的广大群众虽然有种玉米的习惯，但利用玉米做牲畜饲料，特别是用来喂猪，还是从1956年开始的。过去，由于饲料问题没有得到很好解决，虽然群众懂得养猪肥田的好处，但是担心有了猪没东西喂，养猪发展很慢。1956年，县委发现了养猪能手彭化王利用玉米轴、皮、秸喂猪效果很好，于是在全县大张旗鼓地宣传了玉米全身都可以作饲料，以及产量高、抗灾力强等等优点，打破了人们“猪是张口货，养不起”的说法。从此，全县出现了一个增种玉米、大量养猪的新局面。
    为了保证玉米高产、多收，丰润县在种植玉米过程中，认真贯彻执行了深翻、灌溉、优种、密植、杂交、治虫、人工授粉等增产措施。鉴于玉米占全县粮食作物的很大比重，县委特别加强了对玉米生产的领导，从县到生产队，都有一名书记抓玉米生产，不少生产队还建立了玉米种植技术研究小组，培养高产典型、总结和推广丰收的经验。
    为适应农业生产继续大跃进和高速度发展养猪业的新形势，丰润县委对1960年进一步大量发展养猪和解决所需饲料作了规划和安排。今年，全县计划养猪达到一百四十万头，共需精饲料一亿四千万斤到一亿六千万斤，粗饲料七亿多斤。县委规定，每头猪留饲料地一分五厘，主要解决精饲料；另外，采取多种玉米的办法，解决粗饲料。全县计划种玉米五十一万亩，面积比1959年扩大了75．8％；计划亩产八百斤，比1959年增长33．3％。这样，即可解决全县猪只所需粗饲料的三分之一到一半。同时，根据方方（即丰产方）有猪场的情况，每个丰产方都要种上一定数量的玉米，并有干烘炉、粉碎机等加工设备，作到猪到哪里，饲料就在哪里，以便就地供应、就地积肥。
    本报讯　四川著名的玉米产地武胜县，1959年虽然遭到二十多年未有的大旱，但全县二万七千四百多亩玉米，平均亩产仍高达八百一十七斤。其中早玉米一万二千六百多亩，平均亩产达到一千二百零一斤，比大跃进的1958年增产20％。
    玉米是武胜县仅次于水稻、红薯的一种粮食作物。在长期实践中，这个县发现种玉米有许多好处：①产量高。1959年，早玉米的平均亩产比小春高两倍多，比水稻高38％；②增产速度快，幅度大。近几年来，武胜县的玉米平均亩产一直以每年增长20％至30％的速度上升；③适应性强，不论山坡、平原、田埂、地边，不论沙土、黄泥或其他土质，都能种植并获得高产；④不易发生病虫害。产量比较稳定；⑤便于和红薯等粮食作物实行间作、套种，充分发挥土地潜力。1959年，全县在玉米地里间、套种的红薯，总产量达五千多万斤。
    由于玉米生产具有以上优点，武胜县就一直抓紧了对玉米生产的领导，首先是全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”。全县二万七千多亩玉米普遍深耕一尺至两尺，并加厚了土层，每亩施二万多斤底肥；按不同地区分别选用了金皇后、白马牙等玉米良种，实行了合理密植，播种时间也比1958年提早十多天。此外，还适时地追肥攻苗、攻秆、攻穗、攻籽，推行人工授粉等先进措施，促使玉米穗大、粒多、粒重，保证高产。
    为了加强领导，武胜县成立了玉米生产办公室，县、区、公社、管理区和生产队层层有专人负责；以县委书记为首，全县干部和群众还建立了一万多亩玉米指挥片和高产片，创造经验，指导大面积丰产。
    玉米生产的发展，给武胜县带来了多方面的好处。首先，增加了粮食产量，1959年武胜县玉米种植面积仅二万七千多亩，总产量却达到二千二百四十三万斤；小麦种植面积比玉米多四倍以上，但总产量只比玉米多一点二倍。其次，玉米生产的发展，为发展畜牧业提供了大量的优良饲料。玉米心、玉米皮、玉米叶、玉米秆都包含大量淀粉、醣等丰富营养成分，既可作青贮饲料，又可作干饲料。武胜县商业局第一饲养场曾分别用青贮玉米秆和晒干磨细的玉米心喂猪，平均每天长肉十二两，比用油菜壳、花生壳等饲料喂的猪增重快。1959年，全县共提供了玉米心、玉米皮、玉米叶和玉米秆等优良饲料五千六百多万斤，可供二万二千五百头猪吃一年。
    1960年，武胜县计划种植玉米六万亩，面积比1959年增加一倍多。
