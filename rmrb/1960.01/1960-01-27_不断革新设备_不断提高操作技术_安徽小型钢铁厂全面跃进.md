Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, January 26th: Anhui Province's "small foreign-style groups" in the steel industry are shining brightly. In the continuous two years of the Great Leap Forward, it has successively erased two blank spots in the province: in 1958, it erased the blank spot of not producing steel, and in 1959, it erased the blank spot of not producing steel materials.

Through high-speed development from indigenous to foreign, and a combination of both, Anhui's steel industry has entirely mounted the steed of adopting foreign methods of production. In 1959, the province achieved the requirement that "iron is good iron, steel is good steel," and all production was foreign-style steel and foreign-style iron. Steel production increased more than five times compared to 1958, and iron production increased more than three times compared to 1958. Although the foundation for steel material production was just established in 1959, the output that year reached more than 30,000 tons.

The rapid development of Anhui's steel industry is not only rapidly changing the backward state of industrial production in the province, but also showing an increasing role in supporting the leap forward of industries in brother provinces and cities. In 1959, in addition to being self-sufficient, Anhui Province also supplied a large amount of pig iron to steelmaking factories in Shanghai.

Continuously innovating equipment and improving the level of operating techniques are important ways for the comprehensive leap forward of various production indicators of Anhui Province's "small foreign-style groups" in the steel industry. At the beginning of 1959, Anhui Province, based on the situation that small blast furnaces had a short construction time, relatively simple equipment, workers' operating techniques were not skilled, and production was not normal enough, carried out a comprehensive technical transformation of the small blast furnaces. Now, most of the small blast furnaces in the province have implemented measures such as parallel fan ventilation, enlarged tuyeres, increased the diameter and wall thickness of the air ducts, improved the joints and gates of the ventilation pipelines, and multi-nozzle combustion. This makes various ventilation pipelines more reasonable, reduces wind resistance and loss, and increases the amount of air entering the furnace. After a comprehensive renovation of the ventilation system of small blast furnaces in Hefei City, the amount of air entering the furnace generally increased by about 30%, the wind temperature increased from 400 degrees to 500 to 600 degrees, and the smelting intensity increased from 1 to 1.5 or more. While vigorously increasing the wind temperature and air volume of small blast furnaces, steel plants have also made many improvements in raw material management and operating techniques, especially the widespread use of small materials and sintered ore into the furnace, which greatly improved the reducibility of the ore.

After the comprehensive technical transformation, the production level of small blast furnaces in Anhui Province has been greatly improved. In December 1959, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the province increased from 0.636 in January to 1.583, the qualified rate of pig iron increased from 55.7% in March to 91.3%, and the coke consumption per ton of iron decreased from 1.937 tons in January to 1.019 tons; the production cost per ton of iron decreased by 43.8% in November compared with the first quarter.

While carrying out technical transformation, Anhui Province further rationally adjusted the layout of small blast furnaces and strengthened the leadership and management of small steel enterprises. At the beginning of 1959, Anhui localities, based on the "Five Determinations" (determining location, determining type, determining staffing, determining tasks, and determining raw material supply) proposed by the Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, made reasonable adjustments to many steel plants and mines. On the one hand, steel plants were established at the city level to uniformly manage the production of various plants; on the other hand, some small blast furnace groups with inconvenient transportation and supply difficulties were gradually contracted, and efforts were concentrated on building large blast furnace groups with better transportation and supply conditions. At the same time, mines, coke plants, and refractory material plants were placed under the direct leadership of steel plants, so that steel plants had their own raw material supply bases; individual raw material production plants and mines that were inconvenient to be placed under the leadership of steel plants also established fixed supply relationships with steel plants. Through the "Five Determinations" work, the layout of the steel industry became more reasonable, the supply of raw materials was reliably guaranteed, a lot of labor was saved, and the level of enterprise management was further improved. Many steel plants have therefore developed into small steel joint enterprises.

    不断革新设备  不断提高操作技术
    安徽小型钢铁厂全面跃进
    去年十二月份，全省小高炉平均利用系数达到一点五八三生铁合格率达百分之九十一点三，焦比降到一点零一九
    据新华社合肥26日电　安徽省钢铁工业“小洋群”大放异彩。它在连续两年的大跃进中，接连抹掉了全省两个空白点：1958年抹掉了不产钢的空白点，1959年又抹掉了不产钢材的空白点。
    经过由土到洋、土洋结合的高速度发展，安徽钢铁工业已经全部跨上了采用洋法生产的骏马，1959年全省实现了“铁是好铁，钢是好钢”的要求，生产的全部是洋钢洋铁。钢产量比1958年增长五倍以上，铁产量比1958年增长三倍以上。钢材的生产基础虽然刚刚在1959年建立起来，但是当年的产量就达到了三万吨以上。
    安徽钢铁工业的飞跃发展，不仅迅速地改变着本省工业生产的落后面貌，而且在支援兄弟省市工业跃进方面，也显示出越来越大的作用。1959年安徽省生产的生铁，除开自给以外，还大量地供应了上海炼钢工厂。
    不断地革新设备和提高操作技术水平，是安徽省钢铁工业“小洋群”各项生产指标全面跃进的重要途径。1959年一开始，安徽省就根据小高炉建设时间短、设备比较简陋、工人操作技术不熟练、生产还不够正常等情况，对小高炉进行了全面的技术改造。现在，全省大部分小高炉都实行了双风机并联送风、扩大风口、加大风管的直径和管壁、改进送风管道的接头闸门，以及多嘴燃烧等措施。这样，就使各种送风管道更加合理，减少了风的阻力和损失，增大了入炉风量。合肥市小高炉送风系统进行全面改造以后，入炉风量一般都增加30％左右，风温由四百度提高到五百至六百度，冶炼强度由一提高到一点五以上。在大力提高小高炉的风温、风量的同时，各钢铁厂在原料管理和操作技术上也都进行了许多改进，特别是普遍采用小料、熟料入炉，大大提高了矿石的还原度。
    经过全面技术改造以后，安徽省小高炉的生产水平有了飞跃提高。1959年12月份，全省小高炉的平均利用系数由1月份的零点六三六提高到一点五八三，生铁的合格率由3月份的55．7％提高到91．3％，每吨铁所消耗的焦炭由1月份的一点九三七吨降低到一点零一九吨；每吨铁的生产成本，11月份比第一季度下降了43．8％。
    在技术改造同时，安徽省还进一步合理调整了小高炉布局，加强对小型钢铁企业的领导和管理。1959年一开始，安徽各地就根据中共安徽省委提出的“五定”（定点、定型、定员、定任务和定原料供应），对许多钢铁厂和矿山作了合理调整。一方面以市为单位成立钢铁总厂，统一管理各厂的生产；另一方面把一些交通不便、供应困难的小高炉群逐步收缩，集中力量多办那些运输和供应条件较好的大片的高炉群。同时，把矿山、焦厂、耐火材料厂划归钢铁厂直接领导，使钢铁厂有了自己的原料供应基地；个别不便划归钢铁厂领导的原料材料生产厂矿，也同钢铁厂建立起固定的供应关系。通过“五定”工作，钢铁工业布局更加合理，原料材料供应得到了可靠的保证，劳动力节省了很多，企业管理水平有了进一步提高，许多钢铁厂因此而发展成小型的钢铁联合企业。
