Entering the Door of Natural Science
By our reporter Zhang Zhilin

*The work I prepare to research is what the masses need most.*

These are two sentences that Zeng Ruiguang, an "agricultural expert" of peasant origin, wrote on the title page of his work notebook when he began his march towards natural science in 1950. These two sentences are the direction and purpose of his scientific research. Over the past nine years, following this direction, he has successively cultivated more than ten new varieties of poultry and crops such as the "Hongguang Fengtou Chicken," the "Gray Long-haired Rabbit," and the "Jinnong No. 1 Flue-cured Tobacco." The chickens he breeds are abundant in both meat and eggs, the rabbits he raises have fine wool, and the flue-cured tobacco is of high quality and yield, and greatly shortens the maturity period of crops. He has set an example for local production innovation. Recently, he has been immersed in the experiments of "Second Season Peanut" and "Bottom Top Harvest." Some of these experiments have achieved initial success, and some are flowering and bearing fruit.

Zeng Ruiguang is the Party Secretary of the Hongqi Commune in Chengguan, Jinsha County, Guizhou Province. This man, who grew up farming at home and only has a primary school education, has entered the door of natural science after several years of study, under the cultivation of the Party and the support of the masses.

		Books are also written by people

Zeng Ruiguang's formal foray into natural science began with copying ready-made things from books for experiments. For example, the autumn potato experiment was guided by Lysenko's "Agricultural Biology"; the planting of autumn wheat was inspired by the manganese-strengthened grey breeding in "Michurin's Selected Works." Over time, he discovered that many new problems in production were either incomplete or simply not found in books. He had to find other ways beyond the books. This naturally led him to develop a belief in books but without blindly believing in them. In 1954, he saw an article in the "China Agricultural Report" introducing the use of oil cake to feed pigs. The article said: Oil cake can be used to feed pigs, but the amount should not exceed 15% of the total feed, and only half a catty can be fed to a pig per day. Because oil cake contains a kind of glycoside toxin, too much feeding will cause diarrhea in pigs. He thought: Since it is the glycoside toxin that is causing trouble, why can't we think of a way to remove it? He found a feeder as an assistant to prepare for the experiment. At this time, someone advised him: "The book says you can only feed half a catty, what are you still trying to do?" Zeng Ruiguang didn't say it out loud but thought to himself: "Aren't books written by people? Why can't they be changed?" In order to remove the glycoside toxin, he thought of many ways, but none of them succeeded. Finally, he suddenly remembered that when cooking with vegetable oil, there is a raw odor, and if the vegetable oil is fried and sprayed with water, the raw odor will be removed. Thus, a method of detoxification by heat treatment gradually matured in his mind. After several experiments, it was indeed successful. Using this method, it doesn't matter if a pig is fed five catties of oil cake a day. In one year, they used oil cake, Qinggangzi and more than 100 kinds of wild feed to fatten more than 800 pigs without using a single grain. Later, when that article was published as a single book, the original author also made some revisions based on his experiments.

		If you want to study it, you must fall in love with it

Zeng Ruiguang's interest in experiments became more and more intense, and the scope became wider and wider. He often squatted in the field all day without going home, covered in sweat and mud. When he got home, he would also pore over his desk for a long time without looking up. Zeng Ruiguang was indeed very careful in caring for his "treasures." When he was conducting cross-breeding experiments between Angora rabbits and local short-haired rabbits, he had to turn on the lights and get up several times every night to check on them, afraid that they would freeze or starve. In the autumn of 1953, he bought two Yorkshire pigs from the Guiyang Livestock Farm and transported them back to Jinsha by truck. That day was a fiery hot day, and it was too hot to sit quietly in the house, let alone squatting in an open car under the sun. The pigs were panting and couldn't find water to drink. He brought a few pounds of pears when he got on the car, ready to quench his thirst, but in the end, he fed them all to the Yorkshire pigs.

		All experiments start from the needs of the country

Zeng Ruiguang's scientific experiments have another major feature, that is, they focus on practical value and start from the needs of the country. For example, his experiments on "Second Season Peanut" and "Bottom Top Harvest" were carried out in response to the Party's call for "vigorously developing the pig-raising industry" and "increasing the production of oil crops to support national construction."

Jinsha County is a place suitable for planting peanuts, but the local old habit is to sow peanuts and corn at the same time. If peanuts are planted, corn cannot be planted, and if corn is planted, peanuts cannot be planted. At this time, he thought: "Extending the planting period of peanuts, and planting peanuts after harvesting corn, wouldn't that achieve a double harvest of grain and oil!" He immediately looked for a small peanut variety with a upright vine type and conducted a phased sowing experiment in July, August, and September, and all of them were successful. The "Bottom Top Harvest" experiment was what he thought of from feeding pigs with lotus cabbage. Although lotus cabbage is good for feeding pigs, if you add a little more effort to make its roots and leaves edible, it would be the best of both worlds. Therefore, he hybridized kohlrabi and lotus cabbage, and Chinese cabbage and cabbage, and obtained two new varieties. Lotus cabbage and cabbage grow on the top, and kohlrabi and Chinese cabbage grow on the bottom. He gave this type of crop a meaningful name, called "Bottom Top Harvest."

During this period, he also carried out a variety of experiments such as the hybridization of wild Job's tears and domestic Job's tears, and the hybridization of castor silkworms and oak silkworms, with the purpose of changing their properties, so that Job's tears can be perennial, and castor silkworms can adapt to the climate of the mountainous areas of Guizhou and solve complex feed problems.

		Persevering learning spirit

Zeng Ruiguang, an "agricultural expert" of peasant origin, has encountered many difficulties and suffered the pain of failure in this series of studies and experiments due to his low level of education. When he started reading scientific books such as "Michurin's Selected Works," he didn't understand many nouns and terms, so he repeatedly asked others for advice. When there was no one around to answer him, he would skip over them or try to figure out the general meaning by painstakingly studying the context. Often, when the night was quiet, he was still studying hard under the light. When thorny problems arose in production, he always visited old farmers everywhere to ask for advice. Whenever difficulties weighed on him, the Party leadership was always the first to stand up to support him, encourage him, and strengthen his confidence. Responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee, the Prefectural Party Committee, and the County Party Committee have all given him a lot of ideas and solved many specific difficulties. He himself did not bow his head in the face of difficulties, but retreated in times of failure. He often said: "The most taboo thing about studying science is being hot and cold, you must not be afraid of failure to succeed." Zeng Ruiguang has entered the door of natural science with such perseverance. Now, he has formulated a new plan from now to 1962, with a total of fifty-eight projects. He said: "I have only done so little, and the Party and the people have given me so much honor. If I don't go all out to study hard, how can I repay the Party's cultivation and the care of the people of the whole country." (Attached pictures)

    闯进自然科学的大门
    本报记者　张之遴
    ——我准备研究的工作，
    是群众最需要的东西。
    这是农民出身的“农业专家”曾瑞光在1950年开始向自然科学进军时，写在工作笔记扉页上的两句话。这两句话，就是他研究科学的方向和目的。九年多来，他循着这个方向，先后培育出“红光凤头鸡”、“灰色长毛兔”和“金农一号烤烟”等十多种家禽、农作物新品种。他培育的鸡，肉蛋双丰，养的兔，毛质细腻，烤烟优质高产，还大大缩短了作物的成熟期。给当地的生产革新作出了榜样。最近，他又埋头于“二季花生”和“底上丰”的试验。这些试验有的已取得初步成功，有的正开花结实。
    曾瑞光是贵州省金沙县城关红旗公社的党委书记。这个从小就在家盘庄稼，仅仅有小学文化程度的人，在党的培养和群众的支持下，经过几年钻研，现在已经闯进自然科学的大门。
          书也是人写的
    曾瑞光正式钻自然科学，是从照搬书本上现成的东西搞试验开始的。如秋洋芋的试验，是李森科的“农业生物学”给他引的路；秋小麦的种植，是受“米丘林选集”中锰强灰育种的启发。久而久之，他发现生产上的许多新问题，书本上也不完备，甚至根本就找不到。他不得不超越书本另找门路。这就使他极其自然地产生了一种相信书本但又不迷信书本的思想。1954年，他在“中国农报”上看到一篇介绍油枯喂猪的文章。文章说：油枯可以喂猪，但用量不能超过总饲料的15％，每天一头猪只能喂半斤。因为油枯中有一种糖苷毒素，喂多了猪会拉肚子。他就想：既然是糖苷毒素在作怪，为什么不能想想办法除掉它呢？他找了一个饲养员作助手，准备试验。这时有人劝他：“书上都说只能喂半斤，你还试个啥。”曾瑞光口里不说心里想：“书还不是人写的，为啥就动不得？”为去掉糖苷毒素，他想了许许多多的办法，都没成功。最后，突然想起平素用菜油炒菜时，有一股生臭味，如果把菜油煎一煎，用水喷一喷，生臭味就去掉了。于是，一个用加热处理去毒的办法，逐渐在他脑子里成熟起来。几经试验，果然获得成功。采用这个办法，一头猪每天喂上五斤油枯也不碍事。他们在一年中就用油枯、青杠子等一百多种野生饲料喂肥了八百多头猪，没用一粒粮食。后来，那篇文章出单行本时，原作者还根据他的试验作了某些订正。
      要研究它就得爱上它
    曾瑞光的试验兴趣越来越浓厚了，范围越来越广泛了。他常常整天蹲在地里不回家，弄得满头大汗混身泥。回了家也伏在书桌上半天不抬头。曾瑞光对他那些“宝贝”，确实是爱护备至。他在进行安哥拉兔和本地短毛兔杂交试验时，哪一夜都要点灯起床看几次，又怕它冻着了，又怕它饿着了。1953年秋，他在贵阳畜牧场买了两头约克夏猪，搭货车运回金沙。那一天正是红火大太阳，就是静坐在屋子里也嫌热得慌，别说蹲在敞车上顶着太阳晒了。猪晒得吭哧吭哧直喘气，又找不到水喂。他上车时带了几斤梨子，准备自己解渴的，结果，全部都喂了约克夏猪。
    一切试验从国家需要出发
    曾瑞光搞科学试验还有一个最大的特点，那就是：从实用价值着眼，从国家需要出发。譬如他试验的“二季花生”和“底上丰”，就是响应党的“大力发展养猪事业”和“增产油料作物，支援国家建设”的号召而进行的。
    金沙县是一个适合种植花生的地方，但当地的老习惯是花生和玉米同时下种。种了花生就无法种玉米，种了玉米就不能种花生。这时他就想：“延长花生的播种期，收了玉米接着种花生，岂不达到粮油双丰收！”他立即物色了一种立蔓型的小花生品种，在7、8、9月进行分期播种试验，结果都成功了。“底上丰”的试验，是他从用莲花白喂猪联想到的。莲花白喂猪纵然好，如果再给它加上一把劲，使它的根和叶都能吃，那就两全其美了。因此，他便用苤蓝和莲花白杂交、大头菜和白菜杂交，得出了两种新品种，上面结莲花白和白菜，下面结苤蓝和大头菜。他给这类作物取了一个意味深长的名字，叫作“底上丰”。
    在这一时期，他还进行了野生苡仁和家生苡仁的杂交、蓖麻蚕与柞蚕的杂交等多种试验，目的是改变其性能，使苡仁达到多年生，使蓖麻蚕能适应贵州山区的气候和解决复杂的饲料问题。
      坚韧不拔的学习精神
    农民出身的“农业专家”曾瑞光，由于他的文化水平较低，在这一系列钻研和试验中，也碰到过不少困难，有过失败的痛苦。他开始读“米丘林选集”等科学书籍时，好多名词术语弄不懂，他就一遍又一遍地向别人请教。身边无人可以为他解答时，他就采取跳过去，或者联系上下文苦琢细磨的办法揣摸大意。常常是当夜深人静的时候，他还在灯下苦读。生产上出现了棘手的问题，他总是四处登门拜访老农求教。每当困难压头的时候，党的领导总是第一个站出来支持他，鼓励他，坚定他的信心。省委、地委和县委的负责同志，都给他出过不少主意，解决过不少具体困难。他自己也没有在困难面前低头，在失败时候却步。他常说：“钻科学最忌一冷一热，要不怕失败才能成功。”曾瑞光就是这样坚韧不拔地闯进了自然科学的大门。现在，他又制订了一个从现在到1962年的新规划，共有五十八个项目。他说：“我才作这么一点事情，党和人民就给了我这么多荣誉，要不鼓足干劲好好钻研，怎么回答党的培养和全国人民的关怀呢。”（附图片）
