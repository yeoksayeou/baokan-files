Year after year, the red flag comes to our company.
Ordinary company, heroic men,
The red flag inspires us to move forward!
In 1957, for national defense construction,
Safe, good, fast, and economical, a complete cycle,
The annual task was completed ahead of schedule,
No accidents, the red flag comes to our company!
1958, 1959,
The Central Committee announced the General Line,
Cadres and soldiers work together to strive for five goods,
The Five Goods red flag comes to our company.
If you want to strive for the upstream, you must be encouraged,
Where can there be sweetness without suffering?
Honor upon honor,
Determined to be in 1960!
