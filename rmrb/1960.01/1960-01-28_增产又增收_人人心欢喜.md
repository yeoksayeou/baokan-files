Increased Production and Income, Everyone is Happy
    The Xiaogiao People's Commune in Linchuan County, Jiangxi Province, has just finished its distribution. The broad masses of commune members, full of energy, are vigorously engaged in winter production and spring plowing preparations, while joyfully going to market to buy New Year goods and preparing to celebrate the Spring Festival.
    A few days ago, Xiaogiao town was particularly lively. Every time work ended, the staff of the department store and the commune's clothing factory were overwhelmed by the commune members buying holiday supplies and making new clothes. The reporter happened to meet Pan Xifa, a member of the Qinguang Brigade, bringing his daughter to have new clothes made at the clothing factory. His family of eight received 680 yuan in cash in 1959. After depositing 400 yuan in the bank, everyone got a new piece of clothing. On the way back to the commune from the clothing factory, they met Wu Shusheng, a young commune member from the Zhongsu Brigade, and his fiancée. They bought a washbasin, a thermos, a set of corduroy clothes, and a set of blue cloth uniforms, as well as a portrait of Chairman Mao. They are preparing to hold their wedding during the Spring Festival.
    According to statistics from relevant departments of the commune, with the great development of production, the income of commune members has increased along with the continuous increase in public accumulation. In addition to all food being supplied by the commune, the average income per commune member in the whole commune was 93 yuan in cash, an increase of 85% compared with 1958.

    增产又增收　人人心欢喜
    江西临川县孝桥人民公社刚刚结束分配，广大社员一面干劲十足地大搞冬季生产和春耕准备工作，一面喜气洋洋地赶集上市，购买年货，准备欢度春节。
    前几天，孝桥镇上特别热闹。每到收工的时候，百货商店和公社缝衣厂的职工，对购买节日用品和缝制新衣的社员，应接不暇。记者在缝衣厂正好碰上勤光大队社员潘细发带着女儿来做新衣。他一家八口人，1959年分得了现金六百八十元，除存银行四百元，每人都添了一件新衣。由缝衣厂回公社时，在路上又碰见了中苏大队青年社员吴树生和他的未婚妻，他们在街上买了脸盆、热水瓶、一套灯芯绒衣服和一套蓝布制服，还有一张毛主席像。他们准备在春节举行婚礼。
    据公社有关部门统计，随着生产的大发展，在不断增加公共积累的同时，公社社员人人增收。全社社员除伙食全部由公社供给以外，平均每人收入现金九十三元，比1958年增加了85％。
