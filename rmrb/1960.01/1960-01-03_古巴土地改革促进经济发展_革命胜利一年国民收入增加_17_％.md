Xinhua News Agency, Havana. On December 30th, the well-known Cuban economist Jacinto Torras published an article in "Hoy" commenting on the economic achievements made in the first year of the Cuban revolution's victory.

The article stated that over the past year, the Cuban government bravely carried out land reform and adopted other measures to develop the economy, leading to prosperity in all aspects. National income for 1959 is estimated at 2.5 billion pesos, an increase of 17% compared to 1958. Despite the damage caused by the war and the economic sabotage by American companies and large plantation owners, Cuba still produced 5.8 million tons of sugar in the 1959 sugar harvest season.

The article pointed out that since Cuba implemented land reform, American imperialists and Cuban large plantation owners have launched a frenzied propaganda campaign to attack the land reform. American imperialists have taken measures attempting to strangle the Cuban economy, threatening Cuba by reducing the US import quota for sugar.

Speaking of the achievements in production since Cuba implemented land reform, the article said that land reform has increased production and promoted the development of multiple crops. Rice increased by 1.5 million quintals compared to 1958, cotton increased tenfold, corn reached 1 million quintals, potatoes increased by 300,000 quintals, tobacco also increased sharply, and the sown area of peanuts, soybeans, and vegetables also increased.

The article emphasized that in the last eight months, Cuba's imports from the United States have decreased by 22% compared to the same period in 1958. Now American monopoly organizations are worried about the loss of their former colonial traditional market in Cuba.

    古巴土地改革促进经济发展
    革命胜利一年国民收入增加17％
    新华社哈瓦那电　古巴著名经济学家哈辛托·托拉斯12月30日在“今日报”上发表文章，评述古巴革命胜利一年来在经济上获得的成就。
    文章说，一年来古巴政府勇敢地进行了土地改革，并且采取其他发展经济的措施，使各个方面都欣欣向荣。1959年的国民收入估计达二十五亿比索，比1958年增加17％。尽管由于战争的破坏以及美国公司和大庄园主的经济破坏，古巴1959年蔗糖榨季还是生产了五百八十万吨糖。
    文章指出，古巴实行土地改革以来，美帝国主义者和古巴大庄园主发动了疯狂的宣传运动来攻击土地改革。美帝国主义者采取了企图扼杀古巴经济的措施，他们以降低美国进口食糖的份额对古巴进行威胁。
    谈到古巴实行土地改革以来在生产方面的成就时，文章说，土地改革增加了生产，促进了多种作物的发展。稻米比1958年增加了一百五十万公担，棉花增加了十倍，玉米达到了一百万公担，土豆增加了三十万公担，烟草也急剧增加，花生、大豆和蔬菜的播种面积也增加了。
    文章强调指出，在最近八个月中，古巴从美国的进口比1958年同期下降了22％。现在美国垄断组织对他们从前在古巴的殖民地传统市场的丧失感到担心。
