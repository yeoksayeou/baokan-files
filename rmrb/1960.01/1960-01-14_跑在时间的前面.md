    Running Ahead of Time
    By Our Correspondent Wang Chongjie
    In 1959, the Hungarian people achieved brilliant successes in socialist economic construction, with the main targets of the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) being fulfilled one year ahead of schedule. It is estimated that by the end of 1960, the original target for industrial production growth during the Three-Year Plan period will be exceeded by 50%, and agricultural socialist transformation and agricultural production will also achieve tremendous development. Now, the people of the whole country are full of confidence and high morale, advancing from victory to victory, striving to create a higher starting point for the Second Five-Year Plan, and to accelerate socialist construction as soon as possible!

          Rapid Progress
    After successfully completing the first year's tasks of the Three-Year Plan in 1958, the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party, based on the favorable international and domestic situation, put forward the bold slogan of striving to complete the main targets of the Three-Year Plan in two years. In the past nine months, this battle call to accelerate socialist construction has become a reality. At the end of the year, good news from all production fronts flew in like snowflakes, and people cheered for this great victory!
    The Three-Year Plan stipulated that industrial production should increase by 22% from 1957 to 1960. In 1958, it had already increased by 12% compared with 1957. According to the current completion of production tasks, it is estimated that it will increase by at least 12% in 1959, which means that this target of the Three-Year Plan has been overfulfilled one year ahead of schedule.
    The original plan was to increase industrial labor productivity by 15% in three years. In 1958, it had already increased by 8%, and it will increase by 5% in 1959 (originally about 3%). The level of labor productivity in the fourth quarter of 1959 has reached the target for 1960. The original plan was to reduce production costs by 6% in three years. In 1958, the industrial departments had already reduced them by 5%, and they will continue to reduce them by 2.5% in 1959 (originally planned to be 1.4%), and this target has also been overfulfilled one year ahead of schedule.
    Agricultural production was originally planned to increase by 12%-13% in three years. Although there was a drought in 1958 and a poor grain harvest, animal husbandry developed significantly, so the total output value still increased by 5% compared with 1957 (originally planned to be 4.7%); the original plan for 1959 was to increase by 5.2%. Due to the bumper grain harvest and the development of animal husbandry, it is estimated that the annual plan will be overfulfilled, basically reaching the level stipulated in the Three-Year Plan for 1960.
    In the past two years, more than 80% of the total investment stipulated in the Three-Year Plan has been completed, and the increase in national income and people's living standards has also reached the original targets for 1960.
    In the past two years, the Party and the government have adopted a series of active and effective measures based on the actual conditions in the country and the possibilities provided by economic cooperation among socialist countries. First of all, they have vigorously expanded the production of basic raw materials and power, and improved the utilization rate of raw materials and power through technological improvements, thereby ensuring the stability and balance of raw material and power supply. The results have been shown today. For example, it is estimated that industrial production will increase by 10% compared with the targets stipulated in the Three-Year Plan for 1960, but at the same time, the production of coal and electricity can be reduced by about 4% and 1% respectively compared with the targets stipulated in the Three-Year Plan, because this reduced quantity can also meet the needs of increased industrial production. Another example: during the Three-Year Plan period, the machine manufacturing industry will increase by about 55%, while the consumption of steel will only need to increase by 30%. This means that at the end of the Three-Year Plan, the value produced by the machine manufacturing industry with the same amount of raw materials will be about 20% more than in 1957.
    Another new and major step is to adjust the structure of industrial production, especially the machine manufacturing industry. In the past two years, priority has been given to the development of labor-saving and material-saving production departments with technical conditions and export traditions, such as telecommunications equipment, high-voltage equipment, diesel locomotives, and precision instruments. The advantage of reorganizing the industrial structure is not only that the value of products produced using existing raw materials can be increased, and the export of products beneficial to the national economy can be increased; but also that it is possible for the state to concentrate the funds used to develop the technological level of industry on the most important departments, rather than dispersing them to all industries, so that the technological level of these industrial departments can be greatly developed.
    Foreign trade occupies an important position in the Hungarian national economy. The above-mentioned measures have also greatly promoted the improvement of foreign trade, enabling the completion of the original targets for 1960 in the Three-Year Plan in 1959. The turnover of foreign trade has increased by 40% compared with 1955. The composition of foreign trade imports and exports, on the one hand, reflects the changes in the national economic structure, and on the other hand, promotes the development of the country's industrial and agricultural production in the direction most suitable for the domestic environment and conditions. In 1959, in addition to necessary raw materials, Hungary also purchased three times more new-style machines and precision instruments from abroad than in 1955. These imported machines and equipment promoted the development of production and technology in important domestic departments, and helped power production, the petroleum industry, the chemical industry, and agriculture to complete important investment plans. Correspondingly, there have also been major changes in Hungary's export products. In 1959, the export of complete sets of equipment accounted for more than 20% of the total export value of machines, the export value of communication technology products increased by more than 60% compared with 1955, and the export value of instruments doubled. In terms of agricultural product exports, there has also been an increase in products that require a large amount of labor, such as finished products of the food industry. All this ensures the balance of the national economy and international payments, and turns foreign trade from a deficit to a surplus.

          Tremendous Changes in Rural Areas
    The large-scale development and rapid consolidation of the agricultural collectivization movement in 1959 is unprecedented in the history of Hungary's agricultural collectivization movement in the past ten years. At the same time, agricultural production and commodity production have also increased significantly to meet the needs of the national economy. This great victory is one of the important signs of the accelerated development of socialist construction in 1959.
    During the spring upsurge of the agricultural collectivization movement, the number of peasant households and land that joined the cooperatives doubled compared with the level reached at the end of 1958. Now, more than 40% of the towns and villages across the country have completely realized collectivization, and the land area of cooperatives and state farms accounts for nearly 60% of the country's land, and the cultivated land area accounts for 57.5% of the country's cultivated land. In recent weeks, the collectivization movement in various places has begun to develop rapidly again, especially in Vazh and Zhala states, where more and more farmers are joining the cooperatives every day. It is expected that a new upsurge in the collectivization movement will appear this spring.
    With the active support of the whole Party and the whole people, the newly formed cooperatives have quickly been consolidated politically, organizationally, and operationally, and have won great victories on the production front. According to the communique of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office for the third quarter: in 1959, bread grains and feed grains increased by 30% compared with 1958, and the average yield of wheat per hold (equivalent to 8.55 mu) of old cooperatives was 25% higher than that of individual farmers, and the newly established cooperatives were also 15% higher than individual farmers. According to statistics, in October 1959, the density of public livestock per 100 hold increased by 20% compared with 1958.
    The agricultural commodities provided by the cooperatives to the state have also increased significantly. According to the statistics of the Central Statistical Office, in 1959, the cooperatives in Visprem State handed over 105 quintals of bread grains to the state per 100 hold of cultivated land, while individual farmers handed over 22 quintals; the cooperatives in Solnok State handed over 126 quintals to the state per 100 hold, while individual farmers handed over 50 quintals.
    With the development of the collectivization movement, agricultural mechanization has also accelerated. Now, there are more than 31,000 tractors in the country, of which 6,000 were added in 1959 alone. The average usage of chemical fertilizers per hold has reached 77 kilograms, and the irrigated area has reached 150,000 hold.

          Pooling Wisdom and Efforts
    These brilliant achievements on the economic front are due to the correct policies implemented by the Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, relying on the masses, and giving play to the enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses, and increasingly deeply implementing the mass line in socialist construction.
    Due to the enemy's rumors and sabotage, the influence of revisionist views, and some shortcomings that had appeared in the organization of labor competitions in the past, socialist labor competitions were once at a standstill after the 1956 counter-revolutionary riots. In the past few years, the Party has patiently carried out propaganda and education work, exposed the lies and tricks of imperialist and revisionist elements, and gradually improved the political consciousness of the broad masses of workers. When spring came in 1959, a brand-new situation appeared across the country. After the Central Committee of the Party issued the call on March 6 to complete the Three-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule, a vigorous labor competition quickly unfolded across the country.
    The broad masses actively exerted their efforts, used their brains, and tapped the potential for production in the labor competition process. According to statistics, in the first half of 1959 alone, workers across the country put forward 106,000 technical innovation proposals and more than 500 inventions and creations of great significance. Mutual assistance and cooperation and experience exchange between various production units and workers were strengthened, the production process was simplified, efficiency was improved, and production indicators rose day by day, ensuring the completion of the main indicators of the Three-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule.
    In the competition process, the emergence of "socialist labor teams" has received widespread attention. At present, there are more than 4,000 labor teams across the country fighting for the title of "socialist labor team". In addition to completing production tasks, these labor teams also strive to improve their political level, strictly abide by socialist ethical standards, and carry out resolute struggles against the residual influence of bourgeois ideology.
    To welcome the convening of the Seventh Party Congress, the socialist industrial sector alone completed gift tasks of more than 3.2 billion forints (Hungarian currency), and state-owned farms, agricultural machinery stations, and cooperatives completed gift tasks of more than 300 million forints through cost reduction alone.
    The rapid development and consolidation of agricultural collectivization in 1959 was also due to the Party mobilizing all positive factors, going deep into the masses, and patiently carrying out propaganda and organizational work day and night. The whole Party and the whole people worked together to support the development of this movement.
    The Party has also brought into play the initiative and potential of working farmers in consolidating and developing cooperatives and improving agricultural production. While vigorously developing agricultural machinery stations, the government issued a resolution stipulating that cooperatives should be encouraged to purchase various power machines and necessary working machines other than harvesters and threshers themselves. Before mechanization reaches the due level, cooperatives should make full use of animal power and original production tools to improve production while using modern large machines. The government also stipulated that while building modern livestock sheds, cooperatives should also build simple and cheap livestock sheds, and make full use of and renovate the original cow sheds, so as to accelerate the development of public livestock in cooperatives. The government, on the one hand, used the farmers' own and local strength to vigorously develop water conservancy irrigation, and on the other hand, developed advanced irrigation forms such as underground water pipes, sprinklers, and artificial rain, and on the other hand, placed the development of "simple wells", "pipe wells", and traditional ground water diversion and other simple irrigation methods in the first place, so as to develop water conservancy irrigation "more, faster, and more economically".

          Improving Leadership
    In recent years, the central and local Party organizations have continuously strengthened their leadership over economic construction, which is also a guarantee for the accelerated development of industrial production and the great achievements in agricultural socialist transformation in 1959. On October 22, 1959, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Party formulated a resolution to expand the powers of the Party committees of various ministries and bureaus of the government. This measure will better ensure the victorious completion of the work of various ministries.
    In rural areas, with the large-scale development of the production cooperation movement, the Party organizations in various states and districts have regarded the work of Party building in cooperatives as the focus. From January to October 1959, Party branches were established in about 1,500 new cooperatives, making the Party branches of cooperatives leaders and promoters in developing agricultural production and educating working farmers, and ensuring the consolidation and development of cooperatives.
    The government has also better implemented the principle of democratic centralism in economic leadership. Concentration has been strengthened in some important industrial sectors such as capital construction. But at the same time, many unnecessary over-concentration phenomena have been eliminated, and the powers and independence of local parliaments and state-owned enterprises have been expanded. The effect of these measures is that local parliaments and state-owned enterprises are more concerned about production, better tap the potential for production, and the economic work of the leading organs is more effective.
    At the same time, the number of administrative personnel in economic leadership agencies has been reduced. According to statistics, the number of personnel in various ministries and bureaus of the government has been reduced by 45% in the past three years, and the number of personnel in local parliaments has been reduced by 35%, and unnecessary procedures and levels have been simplified, making economic leadership work more flexible. The Seventh Party Congress decided that in the future, the multi-level system of economic and administrative leadership should be further simplified to make it closer to real life.
    The Party and the government have also launched a struggle against bureaucratic leadership style, greatly improving the level of economic leadership.

            Great Victory to Welcome the Spring
    The Seventh Party Congress pointed out that Hungary will end the laying of the foundation for socialism in the next few years, bringing the national economy closer to the economic level of the most developed countries. Comrade Kadar said in his report at the "Seventh Congress": "We are convinced that the complete victory of socialism in our country is also just around the corner; the most beautiful and truest ideal of the Hungarian people for centuries - the socialist Hungary - will be established." The magnificent and splendid prospect inspires the working people of the whole country, and they are marching towards tomorrow with more vigorous steps.
    In 1960, the Hungarian people will complete more arduous tasks. Industrial production will increase by 10% compared with the original targets for 1960 in the Three-Year Plan, and agricultural production will increase by 2% compared with the original targets for 1960. About one-half of the production growth will be completed by improving labor productivity.
    At the beginning of the new year, the broad masses of workers in various factories and enterprises in Hungary have continued to increase production. And they also guarantee to win a great victory in the spring, and welcome the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the motherland on April 4 with brilliant labor achievements.

    跑在时间的前面
    本报记者　王崇杰
    匈牙利人民1959年在社会主义经济建设中取得了辉煌的成就，三年计划（1958—1960年）的各项主要指标已提前一年完成。到1960年底预计将超额50％完成原订三年计划期间工业生产增长的指标，农业社会主义改造和农业生产也将得到巨大的发展。现在全国人民正在满怀信心，斗志昂扬地从胜利走向胜利，为给第二个五年计划创造更高的起点，为尽快地加速社会主义建设而奋斗！
          快速前进
    在1958年胜利完成三年计划第一年的任务后，1959年3月社会主义工人党中央委员会根据国际国内的有利形势，向全国人民提出了争取两年完成三年计划主要指标的豪迈口号。九个多月来，这一加速社会主义建设的战斗号召已变成了现实，年终岁尾各生产战线上的捷报像雪花一样纷飞，人们都为这巨大的胜利而欢呼！
    三年计划规定，1958—1960年三年内工业生产要比1957年提高22％，1958年已比1957年增长12％。根据目前生产任务完成的情况估计，1959年至少也会增长12％，这就是说三年计划的这项指标已提前一年超额完成。
    原订三年中工业的劳动生产率提高15％，1958年已提高8％，1959年将提高5％（原订3％左右），1959年第四季度劳动生产率的水平已达到1960年的指标。生产成本原订三年内降低6％，1958年部属工业已降低5％，1959年将继续降低2．5％（原计划为1．4％），这项指标也提前一年超额完成了。
    农业生产原订三年内增长12％—13％，1958年虽然天旱，谷物歉收，但畜牧业发展较大，所以总产值仍比1957年增加5％（原计划为4．7％）；1959年原订增长5．2％，由于谷物丰收和畜牧业的发展，预计年度计划将超额完成，基本上可达到三年计划规定的1960年的水平。
    两年来，已完成了三年计划规定的投资总额的80％以上，国民收入和人民生活水平的提高也达到了原订1960年的指标。
    党和政府两年来根据国内的实际条件和社会主义国家间经济合作所提供的可能，采取了一系列积极有效的措施。首先是大力扩充了基本原料和动力的生产，并通过改进技术提高了原料和动力的使用率，从而保证了原料和动力供应的稳定和均衡，其成果今天已显示出来，例如工业生产估计1960年将比三年计划规定的1960年的指标提高10％，但同时煤和电力的生产，大约可比三年计划规定的指标分别降低4％和1％左右，因为这减低了的数量也能够满足增长了的工业生产的需要。另外一个例子：三年计划期间机器制造工业大约提高55％，而钢材的使用量却只需要增加30％，这就是说，在三年计划末，机器制造工业用同量的原料所生产的价值却比1957年多20％左右。
    另一新的重大步骤是调整工业生产的结构，特别是机器制造业，两年来优先发展了费工省料、有技术条件和出口传统的电讯器材、高电压设备、柴油机车和精密仪器等生产部门。改组工业结构的好处不仅在于利用现有原料所生产的产品价值能得以提高，增加了对本国经济有利的产品的输出；而且有可能使国家把用于发展工业技术水平的资金不是分散地应用到全部工业中，而是集中使用于最重要的部门，使这些工业部门的技术水平得到了飞跃的发展。
    对外贸易在匈牙利国民经济中占有重要地位。上述措施也大大促进了对外贸易情况的改善，使1959年就完成了三年计划原订1960年的指标。对外贸易流通额比1955年提高40％。对外贸易进出口组成，一方面反映了国民经济结构发生的变化，另外一方面又促使国家的工农业生产向最适合于国内环境和条件的方向发展。1959年除必要的原料外，匈牙利并从国外购买了比1955年多三倍的新式机器和精密器械，这些进口机器和设备促进了国内重要部门生产和技术的发展，帮助电力生产、石油工业、化学工业和农业完成了重要的投资计划。与此相应，匈牙利出口的产品也有了重大的变化，1959年出口的成套设备已占全部机器出口额的20％以上，通讯技术产品的出口额比1955年提高了60％以上，仪器的出口额增加了一倍。在农产品输出方面需要大量劳动的产品，例如食品工业的成品，也有了增长。这一切就保证了国民经济和国际支付的平衡，使对外贸易由逆差转入顺差。
          农村巨变
    1959年农业合作化运动的大规模发展和迅速巩固，是匈牙利十年来农业合作化运动史上从未出现过的。同时，农业生产和商品生产适应国民经济的需要，也有了显著的增长。这一巨大胜利是1959年社会主义建设加速发展的重要标志之一。
    春季农业合作化运动的高潮中，入社的农户和土地都比到1958年年底所达到的水平翻了两番。现在全国40％以上的村镇已完全实现了合作化，合作社和国营农场的土地面积已占将近全国土地的60％，耕地面积占全国耕地的57．5％。最近几周来，各地合作化运动又开始迅速发展，特别是瓦什和扎拉等州，入社的农民一天比一天多。预计今春合作化运动将出现新的高潮。
    新组成的合作社在全党全民的积极支持下，都很快地在政治上、组织上和经营方面得到了巩固，并在生产战线上打了大胜仗。据匈牙利中央统计局第三季度的公报指出：1959年面包谷物和饲料谷物比1958年增加了30％，而老合作社麦子每霍尔特（合八点五五市亩）的平均产量比个体农民高25％，新成立的合作社也比个体农民高15％。据统计，1959年10月份每一百霍尔特公有牲畜的密度比1958年增加了20％。
    合作社所提供国家的农业商品也有了很大增长。据中央统计局统计，维斯普雷姆州的合作社1959年每一百霍尔特耕地交给国家的面包谷物为一百零五公担，个体农民为二十二公担；索尔诺克州的合作社每一百霍尔特交给国家的是一百二十六公担，个体农民是五十公担。
    随着合作化运动的发展，农业机械化也加速了。现在全国已有三万一千多台拖拉机，其中单是1959年就增加六千台，每霍尔特化学肥料的平均使用量达到七十七公斤，灌溉面积达十五万霍尔特。
          群策群力
    经济战线上所取得的这些辉煌成绩，是由于社会主义工人党和工农革命政府实行了正确的政策，依靠群众，发挥了广大群众的积极性和劳动热情，在社会主义建设中日益深入地贯彻了群众路线。
    由于敌人的造谣破坏、修正主义观点的影响和以前在组织劳动竞赛时出现过的一些缺点，所以1956年反革命暴乱后，社会主义劳动竞赛曾陷入停顿。几年来，党耐心地进行了宣传教育工作，揭穿了帝国主义和修正主义分子的谎言和诡计，逐步提高了广大劳动群众的政治觉悟。1959年春暖花开的时候，全国出现了一个崭新的局面。当党中央委员会3月6日发出提前一年完成三年计划的号召后，一个轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛便迅速在全国各地普遍展开。
    广大群众在劳动竞赛过程中积极发挥了干劲，开动脑筋，挖掘了生产潜力。据统计，仅1959年上半年全国职工就提出了十万六千项技术革新建议和五百多件有重大意义的发明创造，各生产单位以及职工之间的互助协作和经验交流加强了，简化了生产过程，提高了效率，使生产指标日益上升，保证提前一年完成了三年计划的主要指标。
    在竞赛过程中，“社会主义劳动队”的出现受到了普遍的重视。目前全国已有四千多个劳动队在为争取“社会主义劳动队”的称号而斗争。这些劳动队除完成生产任务外，并力求提高政治水平，严格遵守社会主义的道德标准，同资产阶级思想的残余影响进行坚决的斗争。
    为迎接第七次党代表大会的召开，仅社会主义工业部门就完成了三十二亿多福林（匈币）的献礼任务，国营农场、农业机器站和合作社仅通过降低成本就完成了三亿多福林的献礼任务。
    1959年农业合作化的迅速发展和巩固，也是由于党调动了一切积极因素，深入群众，夜以继日地耐心进行了宣传和组织工作的结果。全党全民一齐动手支持了这一运动的开展。
    党在巩固发展合作社和提高农业生产方面也发挥了劳动农民的主动性和潜力。在大力发展农业机器站的同时，政府颁布决议规定：鼓励合作社自己购买除收割机和打谷机以外的各种动力机器和必要的工作机。在机械化还未达到应有的水平以前，合作社在利用现代化大机器的同时，并应当充分利用畜力和原有的生产工具来提高生产。政府还规定，合作社在建造现代化的畜舍同时，并要建造简单的廉价的畜舍，充分利用和改建原有的牛棚，以便加速合作社公共牲畜的发展。政府并一方面利用农民自己和地方的力量，大力发展水利灌溉，一方面发展地下水管、喷头和人工造雨等先进的灌溉形式，另方面又要把发展“简易井”、“管井”和传统的地面引水等简易灌溉法放在首要地位，以便“更多、更快和更省”地发展水利灌溉。
          改进领导
    近几年来，中央和地方党组织不断加强了对经济建设的领导，这也是1959年工业生产加速发展和农业社会主义改造获得巨大成就的保证。1959年10月22日党中央全会又制定了扩大政府各部和局党委会职权的决议，这一措施将更好地保证各部工作的胜利完成。
    在农村，随着生产合作化运动的大发展，各州和区的党组织曾把在合作社的建党工作当作重点。从1959年1月到10月，在约一千五百个新合作社内建立了党支部，使合作社的党支部成为发展农业生产和教育劳动农民的领导者和推进者，保证了合作社的巩固和发展。
    政府在经济领导方面也更好地贯彻了民主集中制的原则。在像基本建设等一些重要的工业部门加强了集中。但同时消除了很多不必要的过分集中的现象，扩大了地方议会和国营企业的权限与独立性。这些措施的效果是：各地方议会和国营企业部门对生产更加关心了，更好地发掘了生产潜力，领导机关的经济工作更加有效了。
    同时缩减了经济领导机构中行政人员的数额。据统计，最近三年来政府各部和局的人员减少了45％，地方议会的人员减少35％，并简化了不必要的手续和层次，使经济领导工作更加灵活。党的第七次代表大会决定，今后要进一步简化经济和行政领导的多级制度，使其更接近实际生活。
    党和政府并同官僚主义的领导作风开展了斗争，大大提高了经济领导的水平。
            大捷迎春
    第七次党代会指出，匈牙利今后几年内将结束社会主义的奠基工作，使国民经济接近于最发达的国家的经济水平。卡达尔同志在“七大”作报告时说：“我们确信：社会主义在我国得到彻底的胜利也是指日可望的；匈牙利人民多少世纪以来最美好最真实的理想——社会主义的匈牙利——将会建立起来。”宏伟壮丽的前景鼓舞着全国的劳动人民，他们正以更矫健的步伐奔向明天。
    1960年匈牙利人民将完成更艰巨的任务，工业生产将比三年计划原定1960年的指标增加10％，农业生产比原定1960年的指标增加2％，生产增长的二分之一左右要依靠劳动生产率的提高来完成。
    新年一开始，匈牙利各工厂企业的广大职工已使生产继续上升。他们并且保证在春季里打好一个大胜仗，以辉煌的劳动成绩来迎接4月4日祖国解放十五周年。
