Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 10th: TASS reports from Moscow on January 9th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) passed a resolution endorsing the patriotic initiative of the workers of the New Kramatorsk Machine-Building Plant named after Stalin in Ukraine.

The staff of this plant pledged to carry out technical design on their own strength, and to over-fulfill the production plan by more than 3,000 tons of equipment to modernize the rolling mills, steel casting machines, mobile excavators and other machines previously produced by the enterprise.

The CPC Central Committee suggested giving full support to this initiative and to launch a broad socialist emulation campaign to strive for the rapid modernization of equipment in the Soviet heavy industry, chemical industry and power industry.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: In the past year, the work of updating and modernizing production equipment, mechanizing and automating production processes in Soviet industrial enterprises has made comprehensive progress.

Through last year's efforts, the level of mechanization and automation in many important industrial sectors of the Soviet Union has reached a very high level, and the face of production has undergone drastic changes. In the power and coal mining industries, more than 400 generator units in over 100 large and medium-sized hydropower stations across the Soviet Union have been automated. The power generation capacity of these units accounts for 90% of the total power generation capacity of hydropower stations nationwide. In thermal power stations, the operation of over 85% of boilers has also been automated. In the coal mining industry, processes such as coal cutting, coal falling, and coal transportation have been almost entirely mechanized, and work on the mine working face is gradually transitioning to automation.

In other industrial sectors, more than 30,000 metal-cutting lathes, forging machines and other equipment in the machine-building industry were modernized in the first three quarters of last year. At present, this industrial sector possesses more than 100,000 automated and semi-automated lathes, and 220 fully automated production lines. In the iron and steel industry, many control and regulation procedures in the blast furnace production process were automated last year, and most open-hearth furnaces were equipped with automatic inspection instruments and temperature regulators. The steel produced by these open-hearth furnaces accounts for 95% of the total open-hearth steel production in the country. In the gas and petroleum industry sectors, the transition from partial automation to full automation began last year.

The achievements made by the Soviet Union in industrial technological progress last year are the result of implementing a series of major measures and giving full play to the initiative and creativity of the broad masses of workers.

The widespread adoption of new technologies and the realization of full mechanization and automation of production processes are very important conditions for the successful completion of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan and the establishment of the material and technical base of communism in the Soviet Union. Therefore, the 21st Congress of the CPSU, held at the beginning of last year, attached great importance to this issue and stipulated tasks in this regard in its resolutions. The plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee held in June last year also adopted a series of concrete measures to implement the resolutions of the Congress. Since the beginning of last year, in response to the call of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a wave of enthusiasm for improving production technology and implementing full mechanization and automation of production has been launched across the country. All industrial enterprises across the country have carried out work to improve production technology. Many economic zones have formulated measures to massively expand factories, workshops, update equipment and adopt new technologies. Industrial enterprises in various regions have established organizations to lead and promote the mass technological innovation work.

In the technological innovation movement, the broad masses of workers and scientific and technical personnel in various regions have greatly displayed their creative spirit. For example, the Moscow Economic Zone originally planned to fully mechanize and automate 27 factories and 139 workshops and work sections during the Seven-Year Plan period. However, after discussing the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee, the workers further tapped their potential and greatly improved the original targets. With the efforts of the broad masses of workers, 140 automated, semi-automated and mechanized production lines, and more than 2,000 various automated and semi-automated machines were put into production in the entire economic zone last year. In Voronezh Oblast, thanks to the efforts of the workers, 120 automated and semi-automated machines, as well as 38 automated production lines and conveyor belts, were manufactured in a few months. Industrial enterprises in Ivanovo Oblast modernized more than 20,000 outdated equipment through competition.

    苏共中央号召采用自力更生的方法
    迅速使重工业等部门设备现代化
    乌克兰“斯大林”机器制造厂的爱国倡议获得中央赞同和支持
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科9日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会通过决议，赞同乌克兰以斯大林命名的新克拉马托尔斯克机器制造厂职工们的爱国主义倡议。
    这个工厂的工作人员保证用自己的力量进行技术设计，并保证超计划生产三千多吨设备，来使企业过去所生产的轧钢机、铸钢机、移动式挖掘机和其他机器现代化。
    苏共中央建议全力支持这个倡议，并广泛展开社会主义竞赛，争取最近迅速地实现苏联重工业、化学工业和动力工业设备的现代化。
    新华社莫斯科电　在过去一年中，苏联工业企业中生产设备的更新和现代化、生产过程的机械化和自动化工作获得了全面的进展。
    经过去年的努力，苏联全国许多重要工业部门的机械化、自动化水平都已达到了很高的水平，生产面貌发生了急剧的变化。在动力和采煤工业方面，全苏联现在已经有一百多个大型和中型水电站的约四百个发电机组实现了自动化。这些机组的发电能力占全国水电站总发电能力的90％。在火力发电站中，85％以上的锅炉的工作也已自动化。采煤工业中的割煤、落煤、运煤等过程几乎已全部机械化，矿井工作面上的工作正逐步向自动化过渡。
    在其他工业部门方面，在去年头三个季度，机器制造业的三万多台金属切削车床、锻压机器等装备已实现了现代化。目前，这一工业部门所拥有的自动化和半自动化车床已达十万多台，完全自动化的作业线已达二百二十条。在钢铁工业中，去年高炉生产过程中的许多控制和调节工序都已自动化，大部分平炉都已装备了自动检查仪器和温度调节器。这些平炉所炼的钢已占全国平炉产钢总量的95％。在瓦斯和石油工业部门，去年已开始从部分自动化向全面自动化过渡。
    苏联去年在工业技术进步方面所取得的成绩，是由于实行一系列重大措施和发挥广大职工的积极性、创造性的结果。
    在生产中广泛采用新技术、生产过程实现全面机械化和自动化，是顺利完成苏联七年计划和在苏联建立共产主义物质技术基础的十分重要的条件。因此，去年年初举行的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会就非常重视这个问题，并在决议中规定了这方面的任务。去年6月间举行的苏共中央全体会议，又采取了一系列具体措施，以贯彻执行代表大会的决议。从去年年初起，各地响应苏联共产党的号召，掀起了提高生产技术水平、实行生产全面机械化和自动化的热潮。全国所有的工业企业都进行了改进生产技术的工作。许多经济区都制订了大规模扩建工厂、车间、更新装备和采用新技术的措施。各地工业企业纷纷成立了领导和促进群众性的技术革新工作的组织。
    在技术革新运动中，各地的广大职工和科学技术人员大大地发挥了创造精神。例如，莫斯科市经济区原定在七年计划期间要使二十七个工厂和一百三十九个车间和工段实现全面机械化和自动化。但是，职工们在讨论了苏共中央六月全会的决议以后，进一步挖掘潜力，大大提高了原订指标。在广大职工的努力下，去年全经济区投入生产的自动化、半自动化和机械化作业线达一百四十条，各种自动化和半自动化的机器达二千多台。在沃罗?日州，由于职工的努力，用几个月的时间就制成了一百二十台自动化和半自动化机器，以及三十八条自动化作业线和传送带。伊凡诺佛州的工业企业通过竞赛，使两万多种过时的设备实现了现代化。
