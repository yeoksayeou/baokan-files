This newspaper reports: The Huangting City Commune in Shaoyang County, Hunan Province, recently launched a campaign to vigorously develop diversified operations and increase cash income. From December 20th of last year to January 9th of this year, the entire commune received a total of 150,000 yuan in cash, greatly enriching the funds for spring plowing production.

During the campaign to vigorously increase cash income, the commune party committee led the cadres and masses, through methods such as identifying sources of wealth, calculating income, observing model examples, learning from advanced experiences, and on-site visits, to ensure the smooth development of diversified operations. In the campaign, all teams in the commune, based on the principles of "low cost, less labor, high income, and quick results," extensively opened up avenues for diversified operations and cash income. The commune first focused on the collection and processing of wild plants. The entire commune dug up and utilized a total of 340,000 dan of wild plants, worth more than 30,000 yuan. Within nearly half a month, the entire commune established and put into production more than 100 various processing factories, including 32 wild plant wineries alone. After these processing factories were put into production, they have already generated a cash income of 21,000 yuan. Hunting, fishing, short-distance transportation, and making straw sandals are also diversified operation projects with small costs and quick returns. The entire commune organized six boats for transportation, twenty-one boats for fishing, and forty-nine people for hunting, generating an income of 30,000 yuan. In addition, the commune also paid attention to turning existing goods into cash and mobilized the masses to sell waste products, exchanging them for more than 70,000 yuan in cash.

In order to ensure that products can be quickly exchanged for cash and to promptly meet the needs of production and life during the Spring Festival, they have also achieved integration of production and sales, promoting each other. The commune's supply and marketing cooperative, as well as the brigade, production team, and workshops, have signed purchase and sales contracts separately and prepaid a portion of the advance payments. The supply and marketing cooperative promptly established supply and marketing points, dispatched peddlers to the mountains, factories, and fields for purchasing, greatly promoting the development of diversified operations.

    广开门路　增加收入
    本报讯　湖南邵阳县黄亭市公社最近开展了一个大搞多种经营，增加现金收入运动，全社从去年12月20日起到今年1月9日止，共收入现金十五万元，大大充裕了春耕生产的资金。
    在大抓现金收入的运动中，公社党委领导干部群众，通过摆财源、算收入、看红旗、学先进和现场参观等办法，保证了多种经营的顺利开展。在运动中，全社各队根据“成本低、花工少、收入多、收效快”的原则，广泛开辟多种经营、现金收入门路。公社首先抓住了野生植物的采集和加工利用，全社挖出和利用野生植物共达三十四万担，价值三万余元。全社在近半月内共兴办并投入生产的各种加工厂一百多个，其中仅野生植物酿酒厂就有三十二个。这些加工厂投入生产后，已收入现金二万一千元。打猎、捕鱼、搞短途运输、打草鞋等，也是成本小、收效快的多种经营项目。全社组织了六只船搞运输，二十一只船捕鱼、四十九人打猎，收入达三万元。此外，公社还注意把现货变成活钱，同时还发动群众出售废品，共换得现金七万余元。
    为了使产品能很快地换得现金，及时满足春节期间生产、生活的需要，他们还作到了产销挂钩，互相促进，公社供销部和大队、生产队、厂坊都分别签订了购销合同，并预付了一部分预购款。供销部及时设立了供销点，出动货郎担，上山、到厂、下田进行收购，大大促进了多种经营的开展。
