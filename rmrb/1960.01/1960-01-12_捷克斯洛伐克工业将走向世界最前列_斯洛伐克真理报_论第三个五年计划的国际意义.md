    Czechoslovak Industry to Take the Lead in the World
    – "Slovak Truth" on the International Significance of the Third Five-Year Plan
    The Czechoslovak "Slovak Truth" published an article on January 3rd entitled "The International Significance of Czechoslovakia's Third Five-Year Plan," discussing the substantial growth of Czechoslovakia's economic strength before and after the implementation of the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) and its immense international significance. The article stated that currently, some of Czechoslovakia's important industrial products, calculated per capita, are catching up with the most developed capitalist countries, and some products have already surpassed them. In 1958, Czechoslovakia's coal production (converted to hard coal) was 4,449 kilograms per capita, while the United Kingdom was 4,243 kilograms, West Germany was 3,143 kilograms, and the United States was 2,142 kilograms. In the same year, Czechoslovakia's steel production per capita reached 409 kilograms, West Germany was 446 kilograms, the United States was 445 kilograms, the United Kingdom was 385 kilograms, and France was 328 kilograms. In terms of electricity production, Czechoslovakia still lagged behind. However, in cement production, Czechoslovakia ranked second in the world, only after West Germany, calculated per capita.
    The Third Five-Year Plan stipulates further, powerful development of the Czechoslovak economy. During the Third Five-Year Plan period, industrial production will double. Since industrial production in capitalist countries is difficult and slow to increase, Czechoslovakia's per capita output of the most important products will surpass the most advanced capitalist countries. For many years, capitalist economists have tried to prove that socialism leads to economic decline and backwardness for industrially developed countries. Their claims have been completely refuted. With the completion of Czechoslovakia's Third Five-Year Plan, they will suffer an even heavier blow.
    At the end of the Third Five-Year Plan, Czechoslovakia will produce in two months the same amount of industrial products as it did in the entire year of 1937.
    At the end of the Third Five-Year Plan, Czechoslovakia will produce an average of 739 kilograms of steel per capita, surpassing the United States and West Germany. In 1965, West Germany's average cement production per capita is projected to be 389 kilograms, the United States will be 303 kilograms, while Czechoslovakia will reach 604 kilograms. Production in capitalist countries will also experience some growth, but it is undoubtedly that Czechoslovakia will surpass the most developed capitalist countries.
    In many machine industrial products, Czechoslovakia will take the lead. From 1960 to 1965, the output of machine industrial products will increase by 72%. In 1965, exports of machine industrial products will increase from 42% of the total export value in 1957 to 54%.
    The development of Czechoslovakia's machine industry is of great significance to the modernization and automation of Czechoslovakia's industry and the industry of other socialist countries. Currently, the advanced Czechoslovak industry is already of great importance to other socialist countries because it helps to promote the economic development of socialist countries, and this importance will increase in the future. Naturally, Czechoslovakia's economy also depends on the strong development of the machine industry of other countries in the socialist camp. Czechoslovakia cooperates with other countries in the socialist camp, exchanging goods and resources. In the future, Czechoslovakia will continue to import some machines from other countries in the socialist camp. Specialization of production increases mutual assistance and efficiency.
    The increase in production will inevitably expand economic cooperation between countries in the socialist camp and will inevitably expand the requirements for foreign trade. Obviously, the rapid advance of Czechoslovakia's economy will help accelerate the development and industrialization of some less economically developed people's democratic countries.
    Moreover, Czechoslovakia's economic leap forward creates the possibility of providing assistance to the Asian and African people who have already shaken off and are in the process of shaking off colonial rule in their industrial construction to consolidate their independence.
    The main raw materials needed by the Czechoslovak economy come from the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia also obtains some raw materials by assisting some socialist countries in solving production problems. According to agreements, Czechoslovakia will build fiber factories for Romania, coal mines for Poland, copper mining and smelting equipment for Bulgaria, iron-nickel mines for Albania, and potassium and potash fertilizer factories for the German Democratic Republic.
    The international significance of the Third Five-Year Plan must be assessed from the main economic task of socialist countries. This task is to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output of the most important products. Czechoslovakia is a small country, and in terms of absolute quantity of products, it cannot occupy a decisive position. Czechoslovakia's important position lies in the increase in products calculated per capita. In this regard, when the Third Five-Year Plan ends, Czechoslovakia will greatly surpass the United States, the United Kingdom, West Germany, and France.

### 捷克斯洛伐克工业将走向世界最前列——“斯洛伐克真理报”论第三个五年计划的国际意义

    捷克斯洛伐克工业将走向世界最前列
    ——“斯洛伐克真理报”论第三个五年计划的国际意义
    捷克斯洛伐克的“斯洛伐克真理报”1月3日刊登了以“捷克斯洛伐克第三个五年计划的国际意义”为题的文章，论述了捷克斯洛伐克在执行第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）前后经济力量长足增长的情况和它的巨大的国际意义。文章说，现在，捷克斯洛伐克的一些重要的工业产品，按人口平均计算，正在赶上最发达的资本主义国家，某些产品已经超过了它们。1958年捷克斯洛伐克生产的煤（折合成硬煤）按人口计算为四千四百四十九公斤，而英国为四千二百四十三公斤，西德为三千一百四十三公斤，美国为二千一百四十二公斤。同一年，捷克斯洛伐克生产的钢，按人口计算，每人达四百零九公斤，西德为四百四十六公斤，美国为四百四十五公斤，英国为三百八十五公斤，法国为三百二十八公斤。在电力生产方面，捷克斯洛伐克仍旧落后。但是在水泥生产上，按人口计算，捷克斯洛伐克仅次于西德，居世界第二位。
    第三个五年计划规定了捷克斯洛伐克经济的进一步的、强大的发展。在第三个五年计划期内，工业生产将增为两倍。由于资本主义国家工业生产的增长十分困难而缓慢，捷克斯洛伐克的最重要的产品的按人口计算的产量，将要超过最先进的资本主义国家。多年以来，资本主义经济学家就妄图证明：对于工业发达的国家，社会主义是经济衰退和落后。他们的说法完全被驳倒了。随着捷克斯洛伐克第三个五年计划的完成，他们还要受到更重的打击。
    在第三个五年计划的末期，捷克斯洛伐克在两个月间所生产的工业产品，将等于1937年全年的工业产品。
    第三个五年计划末期，捷克斯洛伐克将生产的钢，按人口平均计算，每人达七百三十九公斤，超过美国和西德。1965年，预计西德每人平均水泥产量将为三百八十九公斤，美国将为三百零三公斤，而捷克斯洛伐克将达六百零四公斤。资本主义国家的生产也会有一定的增长，但是捷克斯洛伐克将超过最发达的资本主义国家是无疑的。
    在多种机器工业产品方面，捷克斯洛伐克将跃居前列。从1960年至1965年，机器工业产品的产量将增加72％。1965年，机器工业产品的出口，将从1957年占出口总值的42％增为54％。
    捷克斯洛伐克机器工业的发展，对捷克斯洛伐克工业和其他社会主义国家工业的现代化与自动化都有很大的意义。现在，先进的捷克斯洛伐克工业已经对其他社会主义国家具有很大重要性，因为它有助于促进社会主义国家的经济发展，这种重要性将来还要增加。自然，捷克斯洛伐克的经济也有赖于社会主义阵营其他国家机器工业的强大发展，捷克斯洛伐克与社会主义阵营其他国家彼此协作、互通有无。将来，捷克斯洛伐克仍将继续从社会主义阵营其他国家输入若干机器。生产的专门化增加了互助与效率。
    生产的增加必然扩大社会主义阵营国家之间的经济合作，必然扩大对外贸易的要求。显然，捷克斯洛伐克经济的跃进，将有助于加速某些经济不发达的人民民主国家的发展和工业化。
    不仅如此，捷克斯洛伐克的经济跃进，对已经和正在摆脱殖民统治的亚非人民为巩固自己的独立而进行的工业建设，造成了进行援助的可能。
    捷克斯洛伐克经济所需要的主要原料来自苏联。捷克斯洛伐克也因为协助一些社会主义国家解决生产上的问题而获得一些原料。根据协议，捷克斯洛伐克将为罗马尼亚建造纤维工厂、为波兰建造煤矿厂、为保加利亚建造铜矿开采及冶炼设备、为阿尔巴尼亚建造铁—镍矿厂、为德意志民主共和国建造钾和钾肥料工厂。
    第三个五年计划的国际意义必须从社会主义国家的主要经济任务上来估计。这个任务就是在最重要的产品方面在按人口计算的产量上赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。捷克斯洛伐克是一个小国家，在产品绝对数量上，不能占决定性的地位。捷克斯洛伐克的重要地位在于按人口平均计算的产品增加量。在这方面，当第三个五年计划结束的时候，捷克斯洛伐克将大大地超过美国、英国、西德和法国。
