Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: Our correspondent reports: The negotiations between the United States and the Nobusuke Kishi government regarding the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," after twenty-two rounds of talks, have officially concluded. U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Douglas MacArthur II, has already returned home on the 9th with the draft of the new treaty agreed upon by both parties. Disregarding the opposition of the Japanese people and the people of all countries, the U.S. and Japan are preparing to formally sign the new treaty in Washington on January 19.

The new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" that the U.S. and Japan are attempting to sign is by no means a "defensive" and "peace treaty" as they claim, but a blatant aggressive military alliance aimed at China, the Soviet Union, and all the people of Asia. The establishment of this open military alliance is primarily to meet the strategic needs of the United States. After the successful launch of intercontinental ballistic rockets by the Soviet Union and the bankruptcy of the U.S. "massive retaliation" strategy, the late U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles openly advocated in "Foreign Affairs" on September 18, 1957, the establishment of a "nuclear-armed zone" around the Soviet Union and China, and demanded that Japan and West Germany be "nuclear-armed." A year later, the U.S. and Japanese governments officially began negotiations to revise the "Security Treaty." The purpose of the United States is to incorporate Japan into the U.S. atomic strategic system, to turn Japan into its nuclear war base, to openly implement nuclear armament, to act as cannon fodder for the U.S. reactionaries, and to form a Northeast Asian military alliance with Japan as its core, completing a military group network in Asia to threaten socialist countries and suppress national independence movements. This aggressive conspiracy of the United States has been strongly opposed by the Japanese people and condemned by the public in various countries. However, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries have acted willfully and stubbornly, and as the situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind has become increasingly apparent, the U.S. ruling group has stepped up its preparations for war, attempting to reverse the decline, and is even more impatiently demanding the signing of a new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." When U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued a statement on December 2 of last year urging Japan to sign the new treaty, he said that the timing of the treaty was "particularly opportune," "because I think it is absolutely necessary for the free world to maintain its unity and strength in the current period of international affairs."

The content of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" draft fully demonstrates that this treaty was drafted according to this aggressive deployment of the United States. Article 3 of the treaty stipulates that the two contracting parties will "individually or in cooperation, continuously and effectively practice self-help and mutual assistance to maintain and develop their respective capabilities to resist armed attack." This stipulates that Japan will accelerate the implementation of nuclear armament and the revival of militarism without limit. Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi has repeatedly publicly declared that Japan's possession of nuclear weapons does not violate the constitution. In accordance with the requirements of this clause, the Kishi Nobusuke government has drafted a second six-year (1960-1965) arms expansion plan, which includes a "comprehensive strategy for U.S.-Japan joint operations," stipulating that "equipping with missiles is the basic policy" and that nuclear armament should be vigorously carried out. The cost of arms expansion will increase to 290 billion yen in the final year of the plan, twice the current amount. When Nobusuke Kishi goes to the United States in mid-January to sign the new "Security Treaty," he will bring this arms expansion plan with him to obtain the approval of the White House owner.

The Japanese army armed with nuclear weapons is by no means for "resisting armed attack," but to act as the U.S. henchman in launching wars of aggression in the Far East. The new treaty draft stipulates that Japan will continue to provide military bases to the United States (Article 6), that the U.S. and Japan will jointly "take action" to deal with "any armed attack on either party in the territory under Japanese administration" (Article 5), and that they will "consult at any time when either contracting party believes that the international peace and security of the Far East or the security of Japan is threatened" (Article 4). Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, in explaining the new treaty, said: "If U.S. troops stationed in Japan are attacked, Japan must also retaliate." He also said: "When Japan is attacked, it is possible to pursue the enemy." According to Fujiyama's explanation, "the scope of the Far East is the areas around Japan, such as the north of the Philippines, the coast of China, and the (Soviet) Maritime Territory." He also said: U.S. troops can be dispatched to "the interior of China or the Soviet Union," and "can be dispatched to areas outside the Far East." Nobusuke Kishi said even more bluntly: "Sending troops abroad does not violate the constitution," and the Japanese army "can be dispatched on the high seas" and can be sent abroad to "attack enemy bases." Therefore, it is quite obvious that the new treaty obligates Japan to send troops abroad and fight jointly with the U.S. army.

Not only that, but Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama also said: The new treaty was "written according to the (U.S.) Vandenberg Resolution," and it "is a kind of spiritual restraint." Everyone knows that the U.S. Vandenberg Resolution is a legal basis for the U.S. to engage in military blocs with its "allies." The aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the U.S.-Chiang, U.S.-Rhee, and U.S.-Philippine military treaties were all established on the basis of this resolution. According to this resolution, the United States expanded the applicable area of ​​the new U.S.-Japan treaty to the entire Far East, making it consistent with the "common defense areas" of the U.S.-Chiang, U.S.-Rhee, and U.S.-Philippine treaties, which in fact formed the Northeast Asian military alliance that the United States had been planning for a long time. According to the new treaty, the United States can enable Japan to take joint action with the troops of the Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Philippine groups in the name of "maintaining peace and security in the Far East." Nobusuke Kishi said in the Diet on March 19 of last year: Japan may "take joint military action" with the United States, South Korea, the Philippines, etc. in Okinawa. In fact, the United States is carrying out activities in this regard. Last October, the United States convened a meeting in Okinawa attended by senior military officers from Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek group, and the Syngman Rhee group to discuss the integrated use of radar networks in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan for "Nike" missile launch training. The "Akahata" revealed that this training is based on China and the Soviet Union as hypothetical enemy countries. Subsequently, U.S. Pacific Command Commander Felt convened a secret meeting in Baguio, Philippines, last November, attended by military leaders from Japan, the Philippines, and the Chiang Kai-shek group, to plan the organization of a Northeast Asian military alliance. Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Secretary-General Sarasin also attended the meeting. The "New York Post" on December 11 of last year revealed the conspiracy of the United States to link these two military groups together. This newspaper revealed that the scope of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" includes Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, and the member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Recently, some sources revealed that Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, Ngo Dinh Diem, and others are brewing a so-called "high-level meeting of Asian anti-communist countries" to piece together a Northeast Asian military alliance.

This deployment by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to intensify tensions and seriously endanger Asian peace has aroused increasingly fierce opposition from the Japanese people and the people of countries around the world. A small handful of die-hard militarists in Japan, represented by Nobusuke Kishi, are attempting to rely on the U.S.-Japan military alliance and use the strength of the United States to retrace the path of militarism, expand into Asia, and relive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." History will prove that their calculations will be completely wrong.

### 美日反动派一意孤行定期修改“安全条约”  新的日美军事同盟严重危害亚洲和平  岸内阁妄图借助美国重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦

    美日反动派一意孤行定期修改“安全条约”
    新的日美军事同盟严重危害亚洲和平
    岸内阁妄图借助美国重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦
    新华社10日讯　本社记者报道：美国同岸信介政府关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，经过二十二次会谈已经正式结束。美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二在9日已经携带双方达成协议的新条约草案回国。不顾日本人民和各国人民的反对，美日双方正准备于1月19日在华盛顿正式签订新条约。
    美日双方企图签订的新日美“安全条约”决不像它们宣传的那样，是一个“防御性”的“和平条约”，而是一个露骨的以中苏和全亚洲人民为敌的侵略性军事同盟。建立这个公开的军事同盟首先是为了适应美国的战略的需要。在苏联发射洲际弹道火箭成功、美国的“大规模报复”战略破产之初，美国已故国务卿杜勒斯在1957年9月18日就在“外交季刊”上公开主张在苏联和中国周围建立“核武装地带”，并且要求日本和西德“核武装化”。一年以后，美日两国政府正式开始谈判修改“安全条约”。美国的目的是：把日本纳入美国的原子战略体系中，使日本变成它的核战争基地，公开实行核武装，为美国反动派充当炮灰；并且形成以日本为核心的东北亚军事联盟，完成在亚洲威胁社会主义国家和镇压民族独立运动的军事集团网。美国这一侵略阴谋曾遭到日本人民的强烈反对和各国公众的谴责。但美日反动派一意孤行，而且随着东风压倒西风的形势愈益明显，美国统治集团更加紧备战，妄图挽回颓势，更迫不及待地要求签订新的日美“安全条约”。美国总统艾森豪威尔去年12月2日发表声明催促日本签订新条约时说，订立这个条约的时机是“特别合乎时宜的”，“因为我认为在国际事务目前的这个时期，自由世界保持自身的团结和力量是至为必要的”。
    新的日美“安全条约”草案的内容充分说明这个条约就是根据美国的这种侵略部署拟订的。条约第三条规定：两缔约国将“单独或通力合作实行不断而有效的自助和互助，以维护并且发展各自为抵御武装进攻而具有的能力”。这就规定了日本无限度地加速实行核武装和复活军国主义。日本首相岸信介已经不止一次公开宣布日本拥有核武器并不违反宪法。岸信介政府根据这一条款的要求已经拟订了包含“日美共同作战的综合战略”的第二个六年（1960—1965年）扩军计划，规定以“装备导弹为基本方针”，要大力进行核武装。扩军的费用在计划最后一年要增加到二千九百亿日元，为现在的两倍。当1月中旬岸信介前往美国在新“安全条约”上画押时，他将随身携带这个扩军计划，去取得白宫主人的批准。
    用核武器武装起来的日本军队决不是为了什么“抵御武装进攻”，而是为了充当美国在远东发动侵略战争的鹰犬。新条约草案规定，日本要继续向美国提供军事基地（第六条），美日两国将共同“采取行动”对付“对于在日本施政权所及的领土上的任何一方发动的武装进攻”（第五条），并且“在缔约国任何一方认为远东的国际和平和安全或者日本国的安全已经受到威胁的时候，随时进行协商”（第四条）。日本外务相藤山爱一郎在解释新条约的时候说：“如果驻日美军遭到攻击，日本也要还击”。他还说：“日本遭到进攻时，有可能追赶敌人”。根据藤山的解释，“远东的范围是，以菲律宾以北、中国的沿岸、（苏联）滨海边区等日本周围地区”。他还说：美军可以出动到“中国的内地或苏联”，“可以出动到远东以外的地区”。岸信介更露骨地说：日本“派兵出国并不违反宪法”，日本军队“可以在公海上出动”，可以派到国外去“进攻敌人的基地”。因此，新条约使日本承担了派兵出国、同美国军队共同作战的义务这一点是十分明显的。
    不仅如此，日本外务相藤山还说：新条约是“根据（美国）范登堡决议写出来的”，它“是一种精神上的约束”。大家知道，美国范登堡决议是美国同“盟国”搞军事集团的一个法律根据。侵略性的北大西洋公约组织和美蒋、美李、美菲军事条约都是以这个决议为基础成立的。美国根据这个决议，把日美新条约的适用地区扩大到整个远东，使它和美蒋、美李、美菲条约的“共同防御地区”相吻合，这就在事实上形成了美国策划已久的东北亚军事联盟。根据新条约，美国可以在“维护远东和平与安全”的名义下，使日本同蒋介石、李承晚集团和菲律宾的军队采取共同行动。岸信介去年3月19日在国会里曾经说：日本可能会在冲绳岛同美国、南朝鲜、菲律宾等“采取联合军事行动”。事实上，美国正在进行这方面的活动。美国去年10月在冲绳召集了有日本、蒋介石集团、李承晚集团的高级军官参加的会议，讨论了综合利用日本、南朝鲜、台湾的雷达网来进行“奈克”式导弹发射训练问题。“赤旗报”透露，这种训练是以中国和苏联为假想敌国的。随后，美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特在去年11月在菲律宾碧瑶召集有日本、菲律宾和蒋介石集团的军事首脑参加的秘密会议，策划组织东北亚军事联盟。东南亚条约组织秘书长沙拉信也参加了这次会议。去年12月11日的“纽约邮报”更透露了美国要把这两个军事集团串连起来的阴谋。这家报纸透露，新的日美“安全条约”适用范围包括朝鲜、台湾、越南、老挝和东南亚条约组织的成员国。最近，一些消息透露，蒋介石、李承晚、吴庭艳等又正在酝酿召开所谓“亚洲反共国家高层会议”，拼凑东北亚军事联盟。
    美日反动派这一加紧制造紧张局势和严重危害亚洲和平的部署已引起日本人民和全世界各国人民越来越猛烈的反对。以岸信介为代表的日本一小撮死硬的军国主义分子企图依靠美日军事同盟，借助美国的力量重新走上军国主义道路，向亚洲扩张，重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦。历史将会证明，他们的算盘将是完全打错了的。
