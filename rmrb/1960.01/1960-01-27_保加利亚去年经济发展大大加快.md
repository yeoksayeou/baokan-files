Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 26th. The Central Statistical Bureau of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers published a communique on the results of the implementation of Bulgaria's National Economic Development Plan for 1959 on the 25th.

    The communique pointed out that Bulgaria's total industrial output value plan for 1959 was completed by 102.4%. Industrial products increased by 24.9% compared with 1958, producing an additional 7.8 billion leva (Bulgarian currency, calculated at comparable prices) worth of products. This rate of growth is equivalent to twice the average annual growth rate of industrial products during the Second Five-Year Plan period (1953-1957); while last year, a 1% increase in industrial products was equivalent to 312 million leva, which is almost double that of the Second Five-Year Plan period.
    The communique said that last year, 3.869 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity were produced, an increase of 28% compared with 1958; coal - 15,341,000 tons, an increase of 21%; iron for steelmaking - 117,000 tons, an increase of 46%; steel - 230,000 tons, an increase of 9%; internal combustion engines - 9,201 units, an increase of more than one and a half times; cement - 1,433,000 tons, an increase of 53%.
    The products of the machine manufacturing and metal processing industries increased by 49.1%; chemical industry products increased by 34.8%; textile industry products increased by 24%; and food industry products increased by 14.9%.
    The communique pointed out that thanks to the great work of the members of agricultural cooperatives, machine tractor stations, and state farm workers, although the climate in a large part of Bulgaria was unfavorable last year, the production of agricultural crops greatly exceeded the output of 1958. Last year, wheat production increased by 4% compared with 1958, barley - 24.8%, corn - 69.2%, ginned cotton - 11.3%, sunflower - 26.4%, tobacco - 22.2%, sugar beet - 65.1%, potatoes - 66.6%. The average yield per decare of five crops, namely wheat, barley, corn, sunflower, and potatoes, exceeded the highest level in Bulgarian history.
    The communique pointed out that the reason for the bumper harvest of agricultural crops was that the members of agricultural cooperatives strengthened field management, expanded the area of irrigated land, and applied more farmyard manure and chemical fertilizers. In 1959, the irrigated area for grain alone reached 1,469,000 decares, an increase of 32% compared with 1958. The amount of chemical fertilizers applied last year was more than double that of 1958.
    The communique said that Bulgaria's animal husbandry production also achieved great success in 1959.
    The communique then talked about the implementation of plans for transportation and communications, capital construction, improving labor productivity, and raising the people's material and cultural living standards.
    The communique pointed out that last year, investment in capital construction increased by 49.4% compared with 1958.
    The communique said that last year, the number of employees in the industrial, construction, transportation, and commercial sectors increased by 132,182.
    The communique said that with the accelerated development of industry, agriculture, and other material production sectors, national income has greatly increased. According to preliminary statistics, last year's national income increased by 20% compared with 1958.
    The communique finally pointed out that the achievements made last year are an important prerequisite for the further accelerated development of the Bulgarian economy.

    保加利亚去年经济发展大大加快
    工业产品增长24．9％，比上个五年计划期间平均增长速度快一倍
    各种农作物产量激增，小麦等作物平均单位面积产量创空前纪录
    新华社索非亚26日电　保加利亚部长会议中央统计局25日发表了保加利亚1959年国民经济发展计划执行结果的公报。
    公报指出，1959年保加利亚的工业总产值计划完成了102．4％。工业产品比1958年增长了24．9％，多生产了相当于七十八亿列弗（保币名，按比较价格计算）的产品。这样的增长速度相当于第二个五年计划期间（1953—1957年）平均每年工业产品增长速度的二倍；而去年的工业产品增长1％，就相当于三亿一千二百万列弗，比第二个五年计划期间将近多一倍。
    公报说，去年生产了电力三十八亿六千九百万度，即比1958年增长了28％；煤——一千五百三十四万一千吨，即增加了21％；炼钢用铁——十一万七千吨，即增加了46％；钢——二十三万吨，即增加了9％；内燃发动机——九千二百零一部，即增加了一倍半以上；水泥——一百四十三万三千吨，即增加了53％。
    机器制造和金属品加工工业产品增加了49．1％；化学工业产品增加了34．8％；纺织工业产品增加了24％；食品工业产品增加了14．9％。
    公报指出，由于全国农业社社员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的职工的巨大工作，虽然去年保加利亚的很大一部分地区的气候条件不好，但农作物生产都大大超过了1958年的产量。去年小麦产量比1958年增加4％，大麦——24．8％，玉米——69．2％，籽棉——11．3％，向日葵——26．4％，烟草——22．2％，甜菜——65．1％，土豆——66．6％。小麦、大麦、玉米、向日葵和土豆五种农作物的平均每狄卡尔产量都超过了保加利亚历史上的最高水平。
    公报指出，农作物获得丰收的原因是：农业社社员们加强了田间管理，扩大了水浇地面积和施用了更多的厩肥和化肥。1959年，单是谷物的水浇地面积就达到一百四十六万九千狄卡尔，比1958年增加了32％。去年施用的化学肥料比1958年多一倍以上。
    公报说，1959年保加利亚的畜牧业生产也取得了很大成就。
    公报接着谈到了运输和交通、基本建设、提高劳动生产率以及提高人民物质和文化水平的计划执行情况。
    公报指出，去年，基本建设投资比1958年增加了49．4％。
    公报说，去年工业、建筑、运输和商业部门的职工增加了十三万二千一百八十二人。
    公报说，随着工业、农业和其它物质生产部门的加速发展，国民收入大大增长了。据初步统计，去年的国民收入比1958年增长了20％。
    公报最后指出，去年取得的成就是保加利亚经济进一步加速发展的一个重要前提条件。
