Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 9th - The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party today published a statement in "l'Humanité" regarding the anti-Semitic fascist provocations in West Germany and other capitalist countries.

The statement emphasized that the resurgence of fascist forces is a result of the Western countries' consistent policy of appeasement and encouragement towards the revanchist and militarist forces of Bonn Germany. The statement reviewed the fact that West Germany used anti-communism and anti-Sovietism as a pretext to revive Nazi forces.

The statement said: The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party believes that the current international anti-Jewish movement is the death throes of fascist forces, attempting to hinder the progress of cooperation among the people of all countries in the world.

The statement also condemned the French government's anti-democratic policies, which fueled the activities of fascists and racists in France.

The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party called on French workers and all democrats to unite to thwart the rampant activities of fascism and racism, and to strive to achieve the following goals: (1) effectively prohibit and punish racist and anti-Semitic propaganda and all racial discrimination; (2) declare all fascist groups illegal and prohibit the publication of newspapers that promote racism and anti-Semitism; (3) remove fascists from the police force and immediately sanction police officers who have committed racist atrocities.

Last December 24th night, West German fascists painted Nazi swastikas and the slogan "Jews Get Out" on a monument to Jewish victims of the Nazi era in Cologne. (Xinhua News Agency draft)

    反犹浪潮是西方纵容西德复仇势力结果
    新华社巴黎9日电　法国共产党政治局今天在“人道报”上就西德和其他一些资本主义国家中的反犹法西斯挑衅发表了一项声明。
    声明强调指出，法西斯势力再次肆无忌惮地出头露面，是西方各国对波恩德国的复仇主义和军国主义势力一贯奉行姑息和鼓励的政策的结果。声明回顾了西德借口反共反苏使纳粹势力重新抬头的事实。
    声明说：法国共产党政治局认为，目前国际规模的反犹太人运动，是法西斯势力的垂死挣扎，它们企图阻挠各国人民之间的合作精神在世界上取得进展。
    声明还谴责法国政府奉行的反民主政策助长法西斯主义和种族主义分子在法国的活动。
    法国共产党政治局号召法国工人和所有民主主义者团结起来挫败法西斯主义和种族主义的猖狂活动，争取达到下述目标：（一）有效地禁止和惩处种族主义和反犹太人的宣传以及一切种族歧视；（二）宣布一切法西斯团体为非法，并且禁止出版宣传种族主义和反犹太人主义的报刊；（三）把法西斯分子从警察机关中清除出去，并立即制裁犯有种族主义暴行的警务人员。
