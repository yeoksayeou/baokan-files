Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th -- The "People's Daily" today published a commentary entitled "The Fascist Crisis in Laos Remains Very Serious," pointing out that the "Provisional Government" established after the military coup in Laos is controlled by the ultra-pro-American reactionary leaders of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" who hold the key portfolios of defense, foreign affairs, finance, and economy.

The commentary stated that Phoumi Nosavan, the head of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" and the current Minister of National Defense, personally commanded the Royal Army to surround the Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Forces and frantically carried out sweeps and massacres against the patriotic and peace-loving forces of Laos. The current Foreign Minister, Khamphan Panya, has slandered and provoked the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and advocated the introduction of American troops and the military forces of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc to interfere in Laos.

The commentary said that the reactionary warlord clique leading the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" has been intensifying the establishment of a military dictatorship in Laos for more than a year to serve the aggression plans of the bellicose elements of American imperialism. To achieve this dangerous goal, they carried out a military coup, overthrew the newly reorganized Sananikone government, blatantly announced the suspension of the National Assembly, and seized power in Laos.

The commentary pointed out that although the Lao warlord clique does not dare to openly control all the power of the "Provisional Government," they control all the most important powers. The Lao fascist crisis remains very serious.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 8th -- Cambodian newspapers have published commentaries on the dangerous situation in Laos caused by the seizure of power by the ultra-pro-American military leaders in Laos.

The "Cambodian Telegraph" said in an editorial today that Cambodia, which borders Laos, believes that the path Laos is currently taking is dangerous. The newspaper believes that the intervention of the Lao army will form a regime in which the army will play a huge and decisive role, and seriously affect the direction of Laos' future policies.

The "Friendship Newspaper" said in an editorial yesterday that the military coup in Laos shows that the United States hopes to act more freely in Laos, which will encourage pro-American elements in other Southeast Asian countries to follow suit.

The newspaper also said that the Lao crisis will exacerbate the tension in Indochina and Southeast Asia. However, the newspaper said that this will open the eyes of the world's people, recognize the true face of the imperialists and the actual situation in Laos, and thus help anti-imperialist forces.

The "Free People's Weekly" pointed out yesterday that the situation in Laos is a direct threat to Cambodia and is part of the imperialist conspiracy against Indochina and Southeast Asian countries. This will encourage the activities of the Son Sann-Son Ngoc Thanh conspiracy group. The newspaper said that the Cambodian people must remain vigilant to prevent the same conspiracy from repeating itself in Cambodia.

    新华社河内10日电　“人民报”今天以“老挝的法西斯危机仍然十分严重”为题发表评论指出，老挝发生军事政变之后成立的“临时政府”，由“保卫国家利益委员会”的极端亲美的反动头目们掌握了国防、外交、财政和经济等主要部门。
    评论说，现任国防大臣的“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目富米·诺萨万曾经亲自指挥王国军队包围寮国战斗部队第二营，并疯狂地向老挝爱国爱和平的力量进行扫荡和屠杀。现任外交大臣的坎番·班雅曾经向越南民主共和国进行诬蔑和挑衅，并主张引进美国军队和东南亚侵略集团的军事力量来干涉老挝。
    评论说，领导“保卫国家利益委员会”的反动军阀集团一年多以来，一直加紧在老挝建立军事独裁制度，来为美帝国主义好战分子的侵略计划服务。为了达到这个危险的目的，他们实行了军事政变，推翻了新改组的萨纳尼空政府，明目张胆地宣布停止国民议会，并掌握了老挝的政权。
    评论指出，老挝军阀集团虽然不敢露骨地掌握“临时政府”的一切权力，可是他们掌握了所有最主要的权力。老挝法西斯危机仍然十分严重。
    新华社金边8日电　柬埔寨报纸就老挝极端亲美的军事首脑攫取政权而造成的老挝危险局势纷纷发表评论。
    “柬埔寨电讯报”今天社论说，同老挝接壤的柬埔寨认为，老挝目前所走的道路是危险的。报纸认为，老挝的陆军干涉将形成这样一个政权，在其中军队将起巨大的影响和决定性的作用，并且严重影响老挝未来政策的方针。
    “友谊报”昨天社论说，老挝的军事政变表明，美国希望在老挝更自由地行动，这将鼓励其他东南亚国家的亲美分子仿效这种做法。
    这家报纸还说，老挝危机将加剧印度支那和东南亚的紧张局势。但是报纸说，这将使世界人民擦亮眼睛，认清帝国主义者的真面目和老挝的实际情况，从而有助于反帝国主义力量。
    “自由人民周报”昨天指出，老挝的局势是对柬埔寨的直接威胁，并且是帝国主义反对印度支那和东南亚各国的阴谋的一部分。这将鼓励桑·萨里—山玉成阴谋集团的活动。报纸说，柬埔寨人民必须保持警惕，以防止同样的阴谋在柬埔寨重演。
