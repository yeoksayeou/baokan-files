The "Red Flag" Calls for Stopping the Revision and Striving for the Abolition of the "Security Treaty"
The Socialist Party Emphasizes that the Abolition of the "Security Treaty" is the Only Way to Open Sino-Japanese Relations
Religious and Women's Circles Oppose the Kishi Government's Revision of the "Security Treaty"

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: Tokyo News: The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Red Flag" published an editorial today, emphasizing that the most important tasks for the Japanese people and democratic forces at present are: to push the activities focused on stopping the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the direction of striving for the abolition of the "Security Treaty," and at the same time, to strengthen the struggle for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Taking these two struggles as the center, further develop various struggles such as striving for comprehensive disarmament, banning nuclear armament, concluding a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, and opposing the revision of the constitution, in order to strive for the realization of a peaceful, independent, neutral, and democratic Japan.

"Red Flag" made these remarks when commenting on the remarks within the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan regarding opening Sino-Japanese relations. The editorial pointed out that at the final stage of the revision of the "Security Treaty," some people within the Liberal Democratic Party and the Kishi Nobusuke government made positive remarks about opening Sino-Japanese relations. However, they not only did not oppose but instead supported the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's revision of the "Security Treaty," which means that they do not want to get rid of the control of the United States and make Japan take a truly independent and neutral path. Instead, they still want to rely on the United States as a basic policy with Japan subordinate to the United States.

The editorial pointed out that as long as they do not take a firm attitude towards U.S. imperialism, their statements on the Sino-Japanese relations issue are merely using the Japanese people's concern for the Sino-Japanese relations issue to cover up the aggressive nature of the new "Security Treaty," which will help U.S.-Japan monopoly capital to carry out imperialist aggression.

"Red Flag" emphasized that, but under the current circumstances, the emergence of opinions on opening Sino-Japanese relations from within the conservative and reactionary camp indicates that the situation is unfavorable to the conservative and reactionary forces, and there is a great possibility of developing in a direction favorable to the people and democratic forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: Tokyo News: The Japanese Socialist Party's "View on the Recent Developments of the Sino-Japanese Issue" published on the 7th pointed out that if the enlightened people of the Liberal Democratic Party truly hope to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations, they should first stop signing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," take a strongly critical attitude towards the signing of this treaty, and immediately deal with the Sino-Japanese issue.

The Socialist Party said that recently, within the Liberal Democratic Party, entangled in factional struggles for the next regime, many people have made some remarks that seem to deal with the issue of breaking the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations, which is driven by the national public opinion that demands to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations. However, many people who make such remarks believe that activities should be carried out with the Chinese government only after the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is over. This idea is clearly an attempt to use petty tricks to force together two completely contradictory foreign policy lines of strengthening the Japan-U.S. military system and establishing friendly Sino-Japanese relations.

The Socialist Party pointed out that this idea lacks an understanding of the trend of easing international tensions. As long as there is no firm confidence in striving for peace in Asia, it will not be possible to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations no matter what.

The Socialist Party stated that it will promote the work of breaking the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations in accordance with the established policy towards China and the spirit of the joint statement issued by Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma and Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs President Zhang Xiruo.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: According to a report in today's "Red Flag," Japanese Christian groups will jointly hold a conference and demonstration march in Tokyo on the 15th with the participation of 1,000 Christians to oppose Nobusuke Kishi's signing of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the United States. This will be the largest political gathering held by Japanese Christian groups after the war. "Red Flag" pointed out that this is the third time that Japanese Christian groups have held such a large-scale political gathering on their own. The previous two times were held in the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs and the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th: Twenty-five prominent Japanese women issued a joint statement on January 1, supporting the proposal for comprehensive disarmament and demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Copies of the statement have been sent to the United Nations headquarters and the governments of the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union.

The twenty-five women who signed the statement include Raicho Hiratsuka, former president of the All-Japan Women's Groups Federation, Ryuko Oyama, former president of the Japan National Relief Association, renowned poet Sumako Fukao, commentator Ayako Ishigaki, Mrs. Tazuko Yasui, wife of Professor Iku Yasui, Michiko Fujiwara, a member of the Diet from the Socialist Party, Natsu Kawasaki, vice president of the All-Japan Women's Groups Federation, and Asano Kanda, director of the Women's Department of the Japanese Communist Party.

The statement said that 1960 is a year in which the Cold War, which has lasted for fourteen years, should be stopped, and steps should be taken towards lasting peace. The statement said that the disarmament that women desire means that a large amount of state budget can be allocated to the construction of housing, schools, and social insurance, and the heavy taxes can be exempted. The statement pointed out that there are many obstacles on the road to comprehensive disarmament, such as the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will hinder the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations and threaten Asian peace.

The statement expressed concern and doubt about the attitude of the U.S. government, because on the one hand, it also expressed support for the proposition of comprehensive disarmament, and on the other hand, it promoted the work of revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The statement said that peace-loving Japanese women hope that negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty" will be stopped immediately and that the treaty will be abolished.

    日本人民不许复活日本军国主义
    “赤旗报”号召阻止修改和争取废除“安全条约”
    社会党强调废除“安全条约”才能打开日中关系
    宗教界和妇女界反对岸政府修改“安全条约”
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论强调指出，日本人民和民主力量目前最重要的任务是：把集中于阻止修改日美“安全条约”的活动推向争取废除“安全条约”的方向，同时加强争取恢复日中邦交的斗争，以这两个斗争为中心，使争取全面裁军、禁止核武装、缔结日苏和约、反对修改宪法等各项斗争进一步发展，以争取实现和平、独立、中立、民主的日本。
    “赤旗报”是在评论日本自由民主党内关于打开日中关系的言论时说这番话的。社论指出，在修改
  “安全条约”到了最后阶段的时候，自由民主党和岸信介政府内部的一部分人士就打开日中关系问题发表了积极的谈话，但是他们不仅没有反对，相反地却支持岸信介内阁修改“安全条约”，这意味着他们并不想摆脱美国的控制，使日本走真正独立自主和中立的道路，而仍然想以日本在从属于美国的情况下依靠美国作为基本政策。
    社论指出，只要他们对美帝国主义不采取坚决态度，他们关于日中关系问题的发言只是利用日本人民对日中关系问题的关心来掩盖新“安全条约”的侵略性质，这将有助于美日垄断资本进行帝国主义侵略。
    “赤旗报”强调说，但是在目前情况下从保守反动阵营内部出现关于打开日中关系的意见这种现象表明，形势不利于保守反动派，而有向有利于人民和民主力量的方向发展的很大的可能性。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本社会党7日发表的“对日中问题的最近动向的看法”指出，如果自由民主党的有识人士真正希望打开日中关系僵局的话，首先应该停止签订新的日美“安全条约”，对签订这个条约采取强烈批判的态度，并且立即处理日中问题。
    社会党说，最近，在自由民主党内部，同争夺下届政权的派系斗争牵扯在一起，有很多人发表了一些好像要处理打开日中关系僵局问题的谈话，这是要求打开日中关系僵局的国民舆论所推动的。不过，很多发表这类谈话的人都认为要在修改日美“安全条约”结束以后才向中国政府进行活动。这种想法显然是一种企图用小手法把加强日美军事体制和建立日中友好关系这样两个完全互相矛盾的外交路线硬凑在一起。
    社会党指出，这种想法是对国际紧张局势趋向缓和的动向缺乏认识。只要没有争取亚洲和平这种坚定的信心，要打开日中关系僵局无论如何是不会成功的。
    社会党表示，它将按照已定的对华政策以及社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎和中国人民外交学会会长张奚若发表的共同声明的精神，推进打开日中关系僵局的工作。
    据新华社7日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本基督教团体将在15日在东京联合举行有一千名基督教徒参加的大会和示威游行，反对岸信介到美国签订新的日美“安全条约”。这将是战后日本基督教团体举行的规模最大的政治性集会。“赤旗报”指出，日本基督教团体单独举行像这种大规模的政治性集会是第三次，上两次是在禁止原子弹氢弹运动和反对修改“警职法”的斗争中举行的。
    据新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本二十五名著名妇女在1月1日发表联合声明，支持全面裁军的建议，并且要求废除日美“安全条约”。声明的副本已经分别寄给联合国总部以及美、法、英、苏四国政府。
    在这个声明上签名的二十五位妇女包括全日本妇女团体联合会前任会长平塚雷鸟，日本国民救援会前任会长大山柳子，著名诗人深尾须磨子，评论家石垣绫子，安井郁教授的夫人安井田鹤子，社会党国会议员藤原道子，全日本妇女团体联合会副会长河崎夏，日本共产党妇女部主任神田朝乃等。
    声明说，1960年是应当停止持续了十四年的冷战的一年，应当采取步骤走向持久和平。声明说，妇女所渴望的裁军意味着可以大量增加国家预算中用于建设住宅、学校和社会保险方面的拨款以及免除沉重赋税。声明指出，全面裁军的道路上有许多障碍，例如修改日美“安全条约”将妨碍日中关系的改善，并威胁亚洲和平。
    声明对美国政府的态度表示忧虑和怀疑，因为它一方面也表示支持全面裁军的主张，另一方面又推进修改日美“安全条约”的工作。
    声明说，爱好和平的日本妇女希望立即停止关于修改“安全条约”的谈判，并且废除这个条约。
