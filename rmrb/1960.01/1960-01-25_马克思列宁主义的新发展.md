Reading the communique on the 1959 national economic development, I felt infinitely excited! The total industrial and agricultural output value in 1959 greatly exceeded the state plan, proving that 1959 was another year of the Great Leap Forward. This brilliant achievement is inseparable from the fact that the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong found three magic weapons for the people of the whole country in the socialist revolution and socialist construction of China two years ago. These three magic weapons are: the general line of building socialism, the development speed of the Great Leap Forward, and the organizational form of the People's Commune. Our national democratic revolution stage also had three magic weapons, namely: the united front, armed struggle, and Party building. These three magic weapons were clearly understood by the whole Party after eighteen years (1921-1938) under the leadership of Mao Zedong. They ensured that the Chinese revolution achieved a nationwide victory by 1949 and established the People's Republic of China. Finding the above three new magic weapons in the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction took only a few years, but they have deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and demonstrated their extraordinary power, making the national economic development in 1958 and 1959 show a continuous Great Leap Forward, completing the production targets of the main industrial and agricultural products of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, making it possible for our country to strive to catch up with the level of the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in the next ten years, and strive to achieve the 1956-1967 National Agricultural Development Program significantly ahead of schedule.

The general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, these three magic weapons, once again prove the truth of what Chairman Mao said: "Once the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism is combined with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, the face of the Chinese revolution will be completely renewed." The general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are the products of this combination, that is, the latest crystallization of Mao Zedong Thought, and a model of contemporary creative Marxism-Leninism. They have enriched Marxism-Leninism in all aspects.

For example, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie runs through the entire transition period. They have economic, political, and ideological aspects, and they have twists and turns that go high and low. We must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and carry out the socialist revolution to the end. Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out that the struggle within the Party regarding the two methods of socialist construction (more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive) generally reflects the struggle between the two roads based on the proletarian and bourgeois worldviews, and so on. These have greatly developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of class struggle during the transition period. For example, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that in socialist construction, it is necessary to combine the correct grasp of objective economic laws with the full play of people's subjective initiative; it is necessary to extend the mass line from military struggle and political struggle to economic construction; and based on the strategic view that the peasant allies problem is an extremely important issue throughout the Chinese revolution, put forward a whole set of "walking on two legs" policies with "simultaneous development of industry and agriculture" as the guiding principle, resolutely implement the Party's mass line policy of building socialism, so that the entire national economy can develop both at a high speed and in proportion, and so on. These elevate the Marxist-Leninist theory of socialist construction to a new stage of development. For example, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, our Party, while striving to build a socialist society, pointed out its relationship with the gradual transition to communism, and gradually creates conditions for the future transition to communism. Therefore, our Party particularly emphasizes the combination of communist ideological education and the principle of distribution according to work; it particularly emphasizes the combination of the supply system and the wage system in the People's Commune. In particular, it has created the best organizational forms for the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people and from socialism to communism – the people's commune. These are even more novel developments of Mao Zedong's socialist and communist theories of Marxism-Leninism. In short, in the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, there are many new and creative Marxist-Leninist theoretical weapons. We must conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, learn to master the sharp revolutionary weapon - Mao Zedong Thought, fight against various erroneous ideas, give full play to the power of the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, to meet the combat tasks of 1960 and the entire 1960s, and bravely struggle for its complete realization!

    马克思列宁主义的新发展
    骆耕漠
    读了1959年国民经济发展情况的公报，感到无限的兴奋！1959年的工业和农业产值都大大超过了国家计划，证明1959年又是大跃进的一年，这一辉煌成就，与中国共产党和毛泽东同志在两年前，为全国人民找到了中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的三个法宝是分不开的。这三个法宝就是：建设社会主义的总路线、大跃进的发展速度和人民公社的组织形式。我国民族民主革命阶段也有三个法宝，那就是：统一战线、武装斗争和党的建设。这三个法宝是在毛泽东的领导下经过十八年（1921—1938年）的时间才为全党认识清楚的。它们保证中国革命到1949年取得了全国的胜利，并建立起中华人民共和国。而在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期找到上述三个新法宝，为时不过数年，已经深入人心，大显神通，使1958年和1959年的国民经济发展出现了连续的大跃进，提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要工农业产品的生产指标，使我国有可能争取在今后十年内，在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国的水平，争取大大提前实现1956—1967年全国农业发展纲要。
    总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三个法宝，再一次证明毛主席所说的“马克思列宁主义的普遍真理一经和中国革命的具体实践相结合，就使中国革命的面目为之一新”的真理。总路线、大跃进、人民公社就是这种结合的产物，也就是毛泽东思想的最新结晶，是当代创造性的马克思列宁主义的一个典范。它们从各方面丰富了马克思列宁主义。
    例如，毛泽东同志指出，在整个过渡时期都贯穿着无产阶级和资产阶级之间的“两条道路”的斗争。它们有经济、政治、思想三个方面，它们有高一阵低一阵的曲折变化的，我们必须保持高度的革命警惕性，把社会主义革命进行到底。毛泽东同志并指出，党内关于社会主义建设的两种方法（多快好省和少慢差费）的斗争，一般就是反映以无产阶级和资产阶级的两种世界观为依据的两条道路的斗争，等等。这些都是大大地发展了马克思列宁主义关于过渡时期的阶级斗争的学说。又如，毛泽东同志指出在社会主义建设中，必须把正确掌握客观经济规律和充分发挥人的主观能动性结合起来；必须把群众路线从军事斗争、政治斗争扩展到经济建设中去；并根据中国农民同盟军问题是中国革命自始至终的极端重要的问题的战略观点，提出以“工农业同时并举”为纲的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，坚决地实现党的建设社会主义的群众路线的方针，使整个国民经济既高速度又按比例地向前发展，等等。这些，就把马克思列宁主义的社会主义建设理论提高到一个新的发展阶段。再如，我们党在毛泽东同志领导下，一面努力建设社会主义社会，一面就指出它与逐渐向共产主义过渡的关系，并为将来向共产主义过渡逐步创造条件。所以，我们党特别强调共产主义思想教育和按劳分配原则相结合；特别强调人民公社的供给制和工资制相结合的原则。尤其是创造了从集体所有制向全民所有制过渡，从社会主义向共产主义过渡的最好的组织形式——人民公社。这些，更是毛泽东同志对马克思列宁主义的社会主义和共产主义学说的崭新的发展。总之，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三个法宝中，有许许多多新的创造性的马克思列宁主义的理论武器。我们必须认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，学会掌握锐利的革命武器——毛泽东思想，与各种错误思想作斗争，充分发挥总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三个法宝的威力，来迎接1960年和整个六十年代的战斗任务，为它的彻底实现而英勇奋斗！
