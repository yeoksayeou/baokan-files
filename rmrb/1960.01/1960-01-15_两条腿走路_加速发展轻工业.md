Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 14th: Guangdong Province is implementing the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and the principle of walking on two legs, resulting in significant development in light industry and textile industry production.

Currently, in major industries such as sugar refining, papermaking, and alcohol production, in addition to a number of large-scale enterprises built with state investment, various regions have also built many small workshops or factories using mass movements. In the papermaking industry, by the end of last year, small workshops and factories had installed seventy-two small paper machines with capacities ranging from half a ton to two tons. Forty-two of these have been test-run or officially put into production, producing 2,500 tons of paper. Guangzhou Paper Mill, a large enterprise with better conditions, also independently manufactured and installed four round-net paper machines with a daily output of six to ten tons last year. Various regions have also built a number of alcohol workshops and small sugar machines capable of crushing fifteen tons of sugarcane per day in the food industry.

In order to solve the raw material problems needed for the development of light industry and textile industry, employees in various regions are exerting great effort and trying every possible means to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. They have adopted six measures: finding (finding raw material resources), substituting (using substitutes), cooperating (cooperating to find raw materials), producing (producing raw materials themselves), saving (saving raw materials), and comprehensively utilizing (comprehensively utilizing raw materials) to meet the needs of production development. The Guangzhou Light Industry Department built more than twenty workshops or factories producing raw materials such as sulfuric acid, caustic soda, and hydrochloric acid in a short period of time using indigenous methods, meeting some of the production needs.

Under the leadership of the Party, and through the efforts of the employees, the total output value of the province's light industry and textile industry exceeded the state's annual plan last year, increasing by 38% and 20.4% respectively compared to 1958. Not only that, but the quality of many products has also been significantly improved, and many new products have been successfully trial-produced. In the textile system, silk fabrics alone added forty-four new varieties last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, January 13th: Many major light industrial products in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are now able to be self-sufficient or semi-self-sufficient.

Among the twenty-six major light industrial products, twelve, including soap, daily-use glass, and alcohol, are now self-sufficient. Eight, including machine-made paper, cigarettes, light bulbs, and sanitary clothing, have achieved semi-self-sufficiency. Six, including matches, batteries, thread, sugar, leather, and leather cases, can be supplied to other areas in addition to self-sufficiency. In previous years, Guangxi could only supply matches by itself, and other light industrial products had to be partially or completely supplied from other provinces. The proportion of local goods in daily necessities sold in the autonomous region has increased from 39% in 1958 to 60% in 1959.

In 1959, while vigorously developing agriculture and heavy industry, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region focused on developing the sugar, paper, food, and fragrance industries in light industry, and also developed textiles, glass, and ceramics. The large and medium-sized light industrial enterprises newly built and renovated in one year included the modern Nanning Sugar Factory with a daily crushing capacity of 2,000 tons, six medium-sized sugar factories, the Nanning Cannery, and the Guilin Cotton Textile Factory with 41,600 spindles, totaling fifty projects, of which twenty-one were completed or partially completed. The construction of these backbone enterprises has greatly increased the production capacity of light industry. For example, the equipment capacity of machine-made sugar factories has reached 5,800 tons per day, and the total capacity of small sugar machines and indigenous crushing methods is 22,000 tons, double that of 1958.

The original light industrial enterprises in the region have greatly improved their equipment capacity and labor efficiency by strengthening leadership, launching mass movements, and carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution. After technical innovations, the daily crushing capacity of the Lingli, Yangshuo, and Hengxian sugar factories has increased by 60% to 80% compared to the original design capacity. The indigenous method of sugar extraction has also been generally improved, increasing the sugar extraction rate. For example, Xiangqian Commune in Binyang County changed one stove and one pot to one stove and four pots, saving half the fuel and increasing the sugar extraction rate by one-third.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, January 13th: The rapid development of light industry and handicrafts in Jiangxi Province is playing an increasingly significant role in meeting the people's living needs and supporting industrial and agricultural production. In 1959, domestically produced daily-use industrial products accounted for 60% of the total supply of daily-use industrial products in the province, of which 78% of fourteen major daily-use industrial products were self-sufficient.

In 1959, the output value of light industry and handicrafts in Jiangxi Province increased significantly. Twenty-four major light industrial products exceeded the plan. The number of new designs and varieties increased greatly, with fifty-nine being produced in batches. The number of handicraft products reached more than 7,400, an increase of more than 700 compared to before August 1958. The quality of light industrial and handicraft products has generally improved.

The mass movement to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution is an important reason for the increase in production in the province's light industry and handicrafts. According to incomplete statistics from key enterprises, more than 300 relatively significant innovation projects have been implemented in the past year. For example, the Jiangxi Glass Factory made a glass tube mouth-baking machine, which increased efficiency by 19.5 times compared to manual operation. The Nanchang Woodworking Factory made a three-sided precision planer, which increased work efficiency by 240 times. Due to technical innovation, the degree of mechanization of the Jingdezhen Universe Porcelain Factory increased from 27.47% to 96%.

    “两条腿走路”加速发展轻工业
    广东轻纺工业大中小厂并举产值增长快
    广西许多主要轻工业品作到自给半自给
    江西轻工业和手工业革新技术产量大增
    据新华社广州14日电　广东省贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线和两条腿走路的方针，轻工业和纺织工业生产有很大发展。
    目前，全省制糖、造纸、酒精等主要行业，除了国家投资兴建了一批大型企业外，各地还用大搞群众运动的办法，建设了许多小型的车间或工厂。造纸行业兴建的小型车间和工厂，到去年底止已安装了半吨至两吨的小型纸机七十二台，其中有四十二台已先后试机或正式投入生产，并生产出纸张二千五百吨。条件较好的大型企业——广州造纸厂，去年也自制和安装了四台日产六吨到十吨的圆网纸机。各地在食品工业方面也兴建了一批酒精车间和日榨十五吨甘蔗的小型糖机。
    为了解决轻工业和纺织工业发展所需要的原料、材料问题，各地职工鼓足干劲，千方百计地开源节流。他们采取了找（找原料材料资源）代（利用代用品）协（协作找原料）产（自行生产原料）节（节约原料材料）综（综合利用原料）六项办法，适应生产发展的需要。广州市轻工业部门在短期内用土办法兴建了二十多个生产硫酸、烧碱、盐酸等原料的车间或工厂，满足了一部分生产需要。
    在党的领导下，经过职工们的努力，去年全省轻工业、纺织工业总产值，都超额完成了国家年计划，分别比1958年提高38％和20．4％。不仅如此，许多产品的质量也显著提高，并试制成功不少新产品。纺织系统仅丝织品一项，去年便增加了四十四种新品种。
    据新华社南宁13日电　广西僮族自治区已有许多主要轻工业产品能够自给或半自给。
    在二十六种主要轻工业产品中，肥皂、日用玻璃、酒精等十二种，现在都已自给；机制纸、卷烟、电灯泡、卫生衣等八种，做到了半自给；火柴、电池、轴线、糖、皮革、皮箱等六种，除了自给以外，还能调出支援外地，而前几年，广西除了火柴能够自给以外，其他轻工业品都要部分地或全部地从外省供应。自治区内销售的日用百货中，地方货源所占的比重，已由1958年的39％上升到1959年的60％。
    1959年，广西僮族自治区在大力发展农业和重工业的同时，根据本区条件，重点地发展了轻工业中的制糖、造纸、食品和芳香工业，同时也发展了纺织、玻璃和陶瓷等工业。一年中新建和改建的大、中型轻工业企业，计有现代化的日榨二千吨的南宁糖厂，六个中型糖厂，南宁罐头厂，拥有四万一千六百个纱锭的桂林棉纺厂等五十项，其中建成和部分建成的有二十一项。这些骨干企业的建设，大大增加了轻工业的生产能力。如机制糖厂的设备能力已达日榨五千八百吨，加上小糖机和土榨共达二万二千吨，比1958年增加一倍。
    全区原有轻工业企业，由于加强领导，大搞群众运动，开展技术革新和技术革命，大大提高了设备能力和劳动效率。伶俐、阳朔、横县等糖厂经过革新技术以后，日榨量都比原设计能力提高60％到80％。土法榨糖也普遍改进生产技术，提高了出糖率。如宾阳县巷浅公社将一灶一锅改为一灶四锅，节省了一半燃料，提高了出糖率三分之一。
    据新华社南昌13日电 江西省轻工业和手工业的迅速发展，在满足人民生活需要和支援工农业生产方面发挥了日益显著的作用。1959年省内自产的日用工业品，已占全省日用工业品供应总量的60％，其中有十四种主要日用工业品自给的比重已占到78％。
    1959年，江西省的轻工业和手工业产值有了大幅度的增长。有二十四种主要轻工业产品都超额完成了计划。新的花色品种大大增加，其中成批生产的有五十九种。手工业产品品种达到七千四百多种，比1958年8月以前增加七百多种。轻工业和手工业品的质量一般都有提高。
    开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，是全省轻工业和手工业提高生产的重要原因。据重点企业的不完全统计，一年来共实现了三百多项比较重大的革新项目。如江西玻璃厂制成玻璃管烘口机，效率比手工操作提高十九倍半。南昌木器厂制成三面精密压刨机，提高工效二百四十倍，景德镇宇宙瓷厂由于开展技术革新，机械化程度由27．47％提高到96％。
