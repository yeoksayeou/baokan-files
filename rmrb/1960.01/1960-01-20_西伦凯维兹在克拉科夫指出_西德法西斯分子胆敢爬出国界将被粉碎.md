Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 18th: According to a TASS report from Warsaw on the 17th, the Chairman of the Political Bureau Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Cyrankiewicz, said that we can proudly say that what we have done in the past fifteen years is something that could not be achieved by generations for hundreds of years in other eras.

Cyrankiewicz made these remarks at the grand meeting in Krakow celebrating the 15th anniversary (January 17th) of the liberation of Krakow by the Soviet and Polish armies.

He said that we have strengthened Poland's position in the world, and the unbreakable alliance and friendship with the Soviet Union and other fraternal socialist countries guarantees Poland's security, integrity, and independence. We have become a member of the powerful socialist camp.

Referring to the recent rampant activities of West German fascists, Cyrankiewicz said that West Germany's turning a blind eye to the activities of Hitler's followers is either stupidity or a criminal act.

He continued, signs of the revival of Hitlerism have appeared in West Germany. The West German government and political groups should be responsible for the further development and consequences of this phenomenon. No one, for whatever reason, can absolve them of this responsibility.

Cyrankiewicz finally pointed out that he agreed with what Comrade Khrushchev said at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union discussing the issue of further reducing the Soviet armed forces: If arrogant fascists gain the upper hand in West Germany, if these scoundrels dare to crawl out of their own borders, then they will not only fail to crawl to Moscow and Stalingrad like Hitler did when he launched the aggression, but they will be crushed on their own territory.

Cyrankiewicz then said that we know that behind these words lies the Soviet Union's powerful strength and the most modern technology. We should choose peaceful cooperation and disarmament as a way to strengthen peace, as proposed by the Soviet Union. The future will determine this issue. And in the future, the socialist countries' camp will play an increasingly important role.

    西伦凯维兹在克拉科夫指出
    西德法西斯分子胆敢爬出国界将被粉碎
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社华沙17日报道：波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员会、部长会议主席西伦凯维兹说，我们可以自豪地说，过去十五年中我们所做的工作是其他时代几百年世世代代所做不到的。
    西伦凯维兹是在克拉科夫庆祝苏军和波兰军队解放克拉科夫十五周年（17日）的大会上说这番话的。
    他说，我们加强了波兰在世界上的地位，同苏联和各兄弟社会主义国家结成的牢不可破的联盟和友谊，保证了波兰的安全、完整和独立。我们成为强大的社会主义阵营的一员。
    西伦凯维兹在谈到最近西德法西斯的猖獗活动时说，西德对希特勒分子的活动熟视无睹，这如果不是昏庸，就是犯罪行为。
    他接着说，在西德出现了希特勒主义复活的迹象。西德政府和政治集团应对这种现象的进一步发展和后果负责。无论是谁，无论是什么理由，都不能使它们摆脱这种责任。
    西伦凯维兹最后指出，他同意赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃讨论再次裁减苏联武装部队问题的会议上所说的这样一些话：如果狂妄的法西斯分子在西德占了上风，如果这些败类竟想爬出本国国界的话，那么，他们不但不能像希特勒发动侵略时那样爬到莫斯科和斯大林格勒，而且在本国领土上就会被粉碎。
    西伦凯维兹接着说，我们知道，在这些话的背后有着苏联的强大威力和最现代化的技术。应当选择苏联提出来的作为加强和平途径的和平合作和裁军。未来将决定这个问题。而在将来，社会主义国家阵营将起着越来越大的作用。
