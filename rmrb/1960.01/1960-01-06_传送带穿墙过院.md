    Conveyor Belt Runs Through Walls and Courtyards
    Recently, workers in the Packaging Department of the Tianjin Aluminum Products Factory successfully manufactured three conveyor belts. These three conveyor belts connect the various work processes that were scattered across seven or eight courtyards.
    Before the conveyor belts, four workers had to carry pots back and forth between the various processes and courtyards, and they could only transport about 400 pots a day. Aluminum pots were even more troublesome. After being made, they had to be sent to the polishing section for polishing. After polishing, they had to go through two alleys and three rooms, traveling more than 100 meters, to be sent to the packaging department for packaging, and then to the packing room 40 meters away for packing. This required eight porters. Just based on the distance from packaging to packing, workers carried the pots back and forth 300 times a day, equivalent to more than 100 li. Because the carrying was heavy and inefficient, the packaging department often experienced bottlenecks in the past, affecting production.
    After the three conveyor belts were made, the production situation in the packaging department changed greatly. After the polishing workers polished the aluminum pots, they simply placed them on the "three-section conveyor belt," and they were sent to the packaging workers in an instant. After the packaging workers installed the handles and packaged the pots, they put them on the "bridge-type conveyor belt," and they were immediately sent to the packing room. The workers who used to carry aluminum pots back and forth now only need to pick up and pass them on while standing next to the conveyor belt. The packaging of aluminum pots is also the same: a conveyor belt connects the processes of crimping the bottom, punching the mouth, punching the eye, and riveting the beam, increasing the transportation efficiency from 400 pots a day to 1,400 pots a day. With the conveyor belts, the packaging department went from having insufficient labor to having a surplus, and eleven people were transferred to support other work sections.

    传送带穿墙过院
    最近天津铝品制造厂包装部工人制造成功了三条传送带。通过这三条传送带就把分散在七、八个院落的各工序连接起来。
    在没有传送带之前，各个工序之间、各个院落之间，每天有四个工人来回不停地运壶，一天只能运四百个左右。铝锅就更麻烦，制成以后到磨光工段磨光，磨光后要经过两条胡同三个房间走一百多米送到包装部包装，包装以后再送到四十米以外的打包室去打包。这样就占八个搬运工人。仅按由包装打包这段距离测算，工人每天搬运三百趟，相当一百多里路。由于搬运笨重、效率低，包装部过去经常发生堵塞现象，影响生产。
    三条传送带制成以后，包装部的生产情况大大改变了。磨光工人把铝锅磨光以后顺手放在“三节传送带”上，一刹那就送到包装工人手里。包装工人安把、包装以后，再放在“桥式传送带”上，又立即被送到打包室。过去搬着铝锅来回走的工人，现在站在传送带旁只要一拿一递就可以了。铝壶包装也是如此，一条传送带把卷底、冲口、冲眼、铆梁等工序连在一起，搬运效率由过去的每天四百个提高到一千四百个。有了传送带，包装部由劳动力不足变成有余，抽调出十一个人支援了其他工段。
