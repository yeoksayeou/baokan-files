Short Commentary:

    When doing work, engaging in production, and making revolution, one should always proceed from the objective and specific conditions of the time and place. Only by adopting practical and effective measures and making conscientious efforts in subjective terms can success be achieved. Violating objective and specific conditions may lead to results contrary to one's wishes and result in failure. However, emphasizing the importance of objective conditions and doing everything from the perspective of concrete objective conditions does not mean that these conditions are unchangeable. Through the efforts of the people, unfavorable conditions can be transformed into favorable conditions, and missing conditions can be created. Only by adopting this correct attitude of both valuing and transforming objective conditions can we do our work well and improve production. The Party Committee and people of the Jinbei area in Shanxi Province are a model of correctly combining subjective and objective conditions and transforming the latter.
    The Jinbei area is historically known as a low-yield area. The climate there is cold, the population is sparse, soil erosion is serious, and cultivation is very extensive. Before liberation, the yield was only sixty to seventy catties per mu, and the people lived in great poverty. In such an area, developing production and improving people's lives are objectively many times more difficult than in areas with mild climates, fertile land, and flat terrain. However, the people of Jinbei were not daunted by these unfavorable objective conditions. Under the leadership of the Jinbei Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, they proceeded from the local objective conditions, fully utilized the subjective initiative of the people, and adopted practical and effective measures to change unfavorable conditions and create favorable conditions. In this way, not only was production developed, but also two consecutive years of Great Leap Forward were achieved, creating an astonishing miracle of high-speed production development in a poor and backward area: In 1959, the total agricultural output value of Jinbei area increased by 30% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958; the total industrial output value increased by 35% compared with 1958, and the financial and trade front comprehensively completed the annual procurement task, showing all-round success. The all-round leap forward in the Jinbei area leads to the conclusion that as long as there is soaring enthusiasm, the subjective initiative of the people is fully utilized, unfavorable conditions are changed, and favorable conditions are created, any region can develop production at high speed.

    高速度发展生产的关键
    做工作，搞生产，闹革命，都应当从当时当地的客观具体条件出发。采取切实有效的措施，经过主观上踏踏实实的努力，才能取得成功。违背了客观的具体条件，就有可能事与愿违，招致失败。但是，重视客观条件，强调做一切事情要从客观的具体条件出发，却并不是认为客观条件是不可改变的。经过人们的努力，不利的条件可以变为有利的条件，缺少的条件，也是可以创造出来的。只有采取这种既重视、又改造客观条件的正确态度，才能做好工作，搞好生产。山西省晋北地区的党委和人民，就是把主观条件与客观条件正确结合起来，改造客观条件的一个典范。
    晋北地区是历史上有名的低产地区。那里气候寒冷、地广人稀，水土流失严重，耕作十分粗放，解放前每亩只有六、七十斤的产量，人民生活非常困苦。在这样的地区，要发展生产、改善人民生活，从客观条件来说，比起气候温和、土地肥沃、地势平坦的地区来，不知要困难多少倍。但是，晋北人民没有被这些不利的客观条件所吓倒，而是在中共晋北地委的领导下，从当地的客观条件出发，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，采取切实有效的措施，改变不利条件，创造有利条件。这样，不但发展了生产，而且实现了连续两年的大跃进，创造了贫困落后地区高速度发展生产的惊人奇迹：1959年晋北地区的农业总产值比大跃进的1958年增长了30％；工业总产值比1958年增长了35％，财经贸易战线全面完成了全年征购任务，出现了满堂红。晋北地区全面跃进的情况，使人不能不得出这样的结论：只要有冲天的干劲，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，改变不利条件，创造有利条件，任何地区都是能够高速度发展生产的。
