    Accelerating the Pace
    By Our Correspondent Wei Lingbing
    “Good weather, clear morning.” This Romanian proverb has become a prediction for the all-round economic and cultural upsurge in Romania in 1959. At the very beginning of last year, the industrial and agricultural fronts presented a brilliant spring scene, full of vitality: eight enterprises, including the “August 23rd” Factory in the capital, jointly proposed a cost-saving competition initiative to workers across the country, which was enthusiastically responded to by more than a thousand enterprises. Metallurgical workers throughout the country launched a wave of competition to improve equipment utilization and reduce production costs. Agricultural workers also threw themselves into the bumper harvest competition, generally starting spring plowing and sowing half a month earlier.
    The Romanian Workers' Party's November 1958 Central Plenary Session called on the working people to tap production potential, increase production, reduce costs, and accelerate the pace of socialist construction. The high production enthusiasm of the national laboring people last year was generated under the encouragement of this call. Factories and enterprises all responded to the Party's call, put forward guarantees for increasing production and practicing economy, launched competitions, and resolved to overfulfill the 1959 production plan. The Workers' Party held a Central Plenary Session in July 1959, and on the basis of developing production, made the decision to increase workers' wages and lower prices. The Central Plenary Session pointed out that improving labor productivity and reducing production costs are reliable methods for raising living standards, and at the same time called on the national laboring people to realize the guarantee of saving 1 billion lei (Romanian currency) in 1959. These resolutions and calls pushed the national production competition movement to a new climax. Workers and staff in various industrial and mining enterprises further exerted their efforts, tapped potentials, and expanded their plans for increasing production and practicing economy.
    After a year of hard work, the Romanian laboring people overfulfilled the task of increasing the overall industrial production in 1959 by 10% compared to 1958, and at the same time saved 1.5 billion lei by reducing production costs and other methods. In agriculture, they achieved a bumper harvest rarely seen in history.
    Key Industries Advance Rapidly
    The Romanian Workers' Party's November 1958 Central Plenary Session pointed out that in 1959, special attention should be paid to the development of industries such as steel, machinery manufacturing, chemicals, petroleum, and electricity. This policy was determined based on the country's actual needs and resource conditions, as well as the division of labor among socialist countries. These industrial sectors have all developed rapidly in the past year. Last year, the steel, iron, and electricity produced in about two months, and the machinery produced in forty-two days, already equaled the entire year's output of these products in 1938. According to preliminary statistics, each industrial sector overfulfilled its production plan last year.
    Last year, Romania's steel production reached 1.4 million tons, an increase of approximately 50% compared to 1958. This is a development speed that has never been seen before in the history of Romanian steelmaking. Last year, the production of pig iron, steel materials, and coke also saw significant increases, with the entire ferrous metallurgy sector's production increasing by approximately 32.2% compared to 1958. The main reason why Romania's ferrous metallurgy industry was able to achieve such great achievements is that metallurgical workers launched an unprecedentedly enthusiastic production competition movement. They did everything possible to improve equipment utilization and reduce production costs. Last year, the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces increased by an average of 20%, and the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces increased by 10%. This year, the production of the ferrous metallurgy industry will continue to develop at a leap-forward speed, and is expected to increase by more than 28% compared to 1959, of which steel production will increase by 22%. Currently, metallurgical workers throughout the country have launched a new production competition movement, striving to overfulfill this new task. Workers at the Hunedoara Metallurgical Integrated Works have guaranteed to produce 40,000 tons of steel and 11,000 tons of iron over the planned target this year, as well as a large amount of steel materials and metallurgical coke. In the first few days of this year, they have continuously overfulfilled their production plans.
    Since Romania has abundant natural resources such as petroleum, natural gas, timber, reeds, and salt, the chemical industry has broad prospects for development in this country. The Second Congress of the Workers' Party regarded the development of the chemical industry as a particularly important task. In order to establish a strong chemical industrial base, investment in the chemical industry last year accounted for 20% of the total industrial investment, an increase of 50% compared to 1958. Last year, many chemical plants and workshops were started or put into production. New products such as man-made fibers and reed pulp were produced for the first time last year. Great importance was attached to the production of chemical fertilizers and plastics. Compared with 1958, the output of these two products increased by about one to two times respectively last year. Romania is vigorously developing the new sector of petrochemicals. In addition to the Borzesti Petrochemical Integrated Enterprise, which is under full construction, some large-scale petrochemical integrated enterprises will also be established in Ploiesti, Craiova, and the Hungarian Autonomous Region in the future.
    This year, basic construction of the chemical industry will continue to be carried out on a large scale, and the output of chemicals will be increased. More than one-fifth of the total industrial investment this year will be used to develop the chemical industry, and the production of this sector will increase by 22% compared to 1959. In the first quarter of this year alone, nine chemical plants, workshops or equipment will be put into production. This year, the production of fibers and man-made fibers will increase by more than three times compared to last year, nitrogen fertilizers, plastics and resins will all increase by more than one time, and streptomycin will increase by nineteen times.
    Romania's machinery manufacturing industry has become an important sector. At present, the machinery manufacturing industry produces more than 1,000 kinds of machines and equipment. Last year, the production of machinery manufacturing increased by about 19.7% compared to 1958, greatly exceeding the original plan. Many new products were produced last year, such as highly efficient double-turbine drill bits, lathes with a speed of 1,600 revolutions per minute, automatic unloading carriages with a load of 80 tons, and new-style corn combine harvesters. In addition, with the collaboration of some machinery manufacturing plants and shipyards, the first batch of internal combustion locomotives and two ships with a displacement of 4,500 tons each (the largest ships currently built in Romania) were also manufactured. This year, the production of the machinery manufacturing industry will increase by 17%, of which petroleum equipment will increase by 63% and tractors will increase by 36%.
    Romania's electric power industry has made outstanding achievements in recent years. Twenty-two large power plants have been built in the past ten years. The Ten-Year Electrification Plan (1951-1960) stipulates that electricity production should reach 7 billion kilowatt-hours in 1960, and this task was nearly completed last year. This year, the "Lenin" Hydropower Station will be partially put into production. In recent years, large thermal power stations will also be built in Craiova and Ploiesti, and some power stations with a total power generation of 4 billion kilowatt-hours will be built in cooperation with Czechoslovakia. This year's electricity production will reach 7.7 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 14% compared to last year.
    Romania also achieved great achievements in industries such as building materials last year.
    Last year, Romania carried out large-scale basic construction work, and built and expanded many open-hearth furnaces, blast furnaces, coke ovens, steel rolling workshops, as well as chemical, wood processing, sugar making, textile and other factories and workshops. Last year, 21,000 housing units were also built. The characteristics of basic construction last year were the concentrated use of investment and materials, and the acceleration of construction speed. The First Construction Company built 1,000 housing units in nine months, and construction sites such as the "Lenin" Hydropower Station were under construction day and night. Many capital construction projects were put into production ahead of schedule last year. Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out at the Workers' Party December Central Plenary Session last year that it is necessary to speed up the progress of existing basic construction projects, and at the same time make preparations so that many large-scale industrial projects can be started in the first few months of 1960. In the future, the construction period of large-scale enterprises will be shortened to two to three years. Great achievements were made in reducing construction costs last year. The construction cost per housing unit has been reduced from more than 68,000 lei in 1958 to 39,000 lei. The unit consumption of steel and cement has been reduced in many projects.
    Great Development of Socialist Agriculture
    The Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party stipulated that by 1960, the socialist agricultural sector should occupy a dominant position in terms of the area of land occupied and the supply of commercial products. This task has been completed more than a year ahead of schedule last year. The cultivated land area of the socialist agricultural sector now accounts for 72.2% of the country's cultivated land area (including the cultivated land of agricultural co-operatives); in the central reserves of state agricultural products, 76% of the wheat, 67% of the corn, 70% of the sunflower, and 80% of the sugar beet are supplied by the socialist agricultural sector. This is the result of the continuous development and consolidation of agricultural co-operatives and state farms, and it marks that socialism has achieved a decisive victory in the countryside.
    As socialist agriculture has shown great superiority and the Party's socialist education for farmers has been strengthened, Romania's agricultural collectivization movement has developed rapidly in recent years. Last year, 750,000 peasant households joined various cooperative organizations, which was a year of great development for the agricultural collectivization movement. As of December 1 last year, socialist agricultural cooperative organizations included more than 2,610,000 households, accounting for 72.8% of the country's peasant households. The Party and the government not only actively guide the continuous development of the agricultural cooperation movement, but also pay great attention to consolidating the newly established collective farms and co-operatives organizationally and economically. Last year, the public property of co-operatives increased by approximately 60% compared to 1958. A few years ago, there were very few collective farms with cash incomes of more than one million lei, but now many collective farms have incomes of several million lei.
    With the continuous increase in income, the public welfare undertakings of collective farms have greatly developed. In addition to expanding cultural and health facilities, many collective farms now implement a pension system. This shows that the income of many collective farms can now not only meet the current needs of villagers with labor capacity, but also guarantee the lives of those who have lost their labor capacity. The Workers' Party Central Plenary Session in July last year expressed support for this measure and instructed the Party organization to study this issue in order to formulate a unified pension system.
    The Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Council of Ministers made a decision last year to strengthen the Party's leadership and supervision over state farms and improve the economic work of state farms. In the process of implementing this decision, a large number of experienced cadres were transferred from factories and agencies to participate in the leadership work of state farms. Last year, each state farm implemented an economic accounting system. State farms made great achievements in improving labor organization last year. The number of integrated mechanized cultivation teams has increased to 820. This kind of cultivation team generally consists of five people using five tractors, fixed to work on 500 hectares of land. This form of labor organization has shown superiority in improving the yield per unit area and reducing production costs. Compared with the average yield per unit area of state farms, the yield of integrated mechanized cultivation teams is 26%-65% higher, while the cost is 30%-35% lower.
    The above-mentioned measures have played a great role in the development of state farms. Some farms that had losses in the past have now become profitable units. In 1957, the average yield per unit area of the main crops of state farms in Craiova Prefecture was all lower than that of collective farms, and even the yield of some crops was lower than that of individual farmers. But last year, this abnormal situation has been fundamentally changed, and the yield per unit area of crops in state farms is almost entirely higher than that of collective farms, cooperatives and individual farmers. The agricultural and livestock products provided by state farms to the state have also increased significantly. Last year, state farms across the country supplied 168,000 tons of wheat and rye over the planned target to the state.
    On the basis of the vigorous development of socialist agriculture, Romania's total grain output last year increased by about 50% compared to 1958. The yield per unit area of grain crops was also higher than that of the bumper year of 1957. The reason why such a good harvest could be achieved last year is that agricultural workers responded to the calls of the two Central Plenary Sessions of the Workers' Party in November 1958 and July last year to improve the yield per unit area and reduce the cost of agricultural products. Many state farms, collective farms, and cooperatives participated in the bumper harvest competition movement. They adopted technical measures such as deep plowing, more fertilization, timely sowing, and strengthening field management. The great achievements made in water conservancy construction and soil improvement last year played a certain role in the bumper harvest. In one year last year, the irrigated area nearly doubled, and flood prevention and drainage work was carried out on 300,000 hectares of land, of which the work on 100,000 hectares of land has been completed. These achievements were achieved on the basis of mass movements. The rapid increase in tractors and other agricultural machinery is also an important factor in the bumper harvest last year. Last year, the number of tractors has increased to 52,000 (15 horsepower each), and the number of other agricultural machinery has also increased significantly.
    The decree on the elimination of any remaining forms of exploitation in agriculture, issued by the Presidium of the Great National Assembly of Romania last spring, has been implemented. The last exploiting class in the countryside—the rich peasant class—has been eliminated, which has a very far-reaching significance for the development of socialist construction in the countryside.
    Deeply into the Masses, Facing Production
    The three Central Plenary Sessions held by the Workers' Party in November 1958 and July and December last year all emphasized that Party organizations must strengthen their leadership over economic work. Economic sectors have all implemented the Party's instructions last year, and the Party's work has been more closely linked to production activities. Conservative ideas in economic leadership have been criticized. Party organizations and Party members have carried out extensive political and ideological work among the masses, mobilizing the vast number of workers to participate in the production competition movement. At the same time, Party organizations have also worked with administrative leaders and technical personnel to solve specific problems in production. Last year, the Party's leadership over agricultural production was also strengthened. Leaders of prefecture and county Party committees were assigned to be responsible for leading agricultural production and the collectivization movement in certain areas.
    Many new atmospheres emerged in culture and education last year. The policy of education serving socialist construction has been earnestly implemented. The practical activities of students in engineering and technical disciplines have greatly increased. They have signed contracts with some factories and often go to factories for internships, solving problems in production together with workers. Students in the architecture department of the Timisoara State Engineering College designed and built a four-story office building by themselves.
    Political education and labor education for students achieved good results last year. The Central Committee of the Socialist Labor Youth League called on each youth to do 100 hours of voluntary labor each year, and many youths' voluntary labor time exceeded this standard. During the summer vacation last year, tens of thousands of university and middle school students went to construction sites or rural areas to participate in voluntary labor. They realized that labor is a glorious thing. Last year, more than 800,000 youths across the country participated in patriotic work teams and carried out various voluntary labor activities.
    In the past year, many writers and artists have gone deeper into life and contacted the masses more. They have created many excellent works based on the principles of socialist realism. Many literary works newly published last year are mostly based on the Party's heroic struggle in leading the people in the past or the current great socialist construction. Last year, many writers went to the countryside and factories to strengthen their ties with the working people, and they met with 100,000 industrial and agricultural workers. Under the initiative of young actors at the Bacau State Theater, many actors went to the countryside to perform and assist farmers in carrying out cultural activities. Recently, some artists will also go to industrial centers to experience the lives of workers.

    1960 is the first year of Romania's implementation of the national six-year plan, which is about to be formulated. The Central Plenary Session held by the Workers' Party in December last year put forward the goals for this year for the national laboring people, and the national laboring people are working hard for this goal with high labor enthusiasm, using their new production achievements to greet the Third Congress of the Workers' Party, which will be held this spring.

    加速前进的步伐
    本报记者　魏凌冰
    “天气好，看清早。”这句罗马尼亚谚语已成了1959年罗马尼亚经济、文化全面高涨的预言。去年一开头，在工农业战线上就呈现出春光灿烂，欣欣向荣的景象：首都“8月23日”工厂等八个企业联名向全国职工提出了节约竞赛的倡议，这个倡议得到了一千多个企业的热烈响应。全国冶金工人掀起了提高设备利用率、降低生产成本的竞赛热潮。农业劳动者也投入了丰产竞赛运动，一般都提前半个月开始了春耕春播工作。
    罗马尼亚工人党1958年11月中央全会，号召劳动人民大挖生产潜力，增加生产，降低成本，加速社会主义建设的步伐。去年全国劳动人民的高涨的生产积极性正是在这个号召的鼓舞下产生的。各工厂企业都响应党的号召，提出了增产节约保证，展开竞赛，决心超额完成1959年的生产计划。工人党在1959年7月举行的中央全会，在发展生产的基础上作出了增加职工工资、降低物价的决定。中央全会指出，提高劳动生产率和降低生产成本是提高生活水平的可靠方法，同时号召全国劳动人民实现在1959年节约十亿列伊（罗币）的保证。这些决议和号召把全国的生产竞赛运动推向了一个新的高潮。各工矿企业职工都进一步发挥干劲，挖掘潜力，扩大了增产节约计划。
    经过一年的辛勤劳动，罗马尼亚劳动人民超额完成了使1959年的整个工业生产比1958年增长10％的任务，同时还通过降低生产成本等方法节约了十五亿列伊；在农业方面获得了历史上少有的丰收。
    重点工业飞速前进
    工人党1958年11月中央全会曾经指出，1959年应当特别注意发展钢铁、机器制造、化学、石油、电力等工业。这个方针是根据本国实际需要和资源情况以及社会主义国家间的分工确定的。这些工业部门在去年都得到了迅速发展。去年每两个月左右生产的钢、铁、电力和每四十二天生产的机器已经等于1938年这些产品的全年产量。根据初步统计，去年各工业部门都超额完成了生产计划。
    去年，罗马尼亚的钢产量达到了一百四十万吨，比1958年约增长50％。这是罗马尼亚炼钢史上从来没有过的发展速度。去年生铁、钢材和焦炭的生产也都有很大增长，整个黑色冶金部门的生产大约比1958年增长了32．2％。罗马尼亚黑色冶金工业能取得这样的巨大成就，主要是由于冶金工人们开展了空前热烈的生产竞赛运动。他们千方百计提高了设备利用率，降低了生产成本。去年平炉的利用系数平均提高了20％，高炉利用系数提高了10％。今年黑色冶金工业的生产将继续以跃进速度发展，预计比1959年增长28％以上，其中钢的生产将增长22％。目前，全国冶金工人又展开了新的生产竞赛运动，争取超额完成这个新的任务。洪尼多阿拉冶金联合工厂的职工保证今年超计划生产四万吨钢，一万一千吨铁和大量的钢材、冶金焦。他们在今年的头几天中已经接连超额完成了生产计划。
    由于罗马尼亚有丰富的石油、天然气、木材、芦苇和盐等自然资源，化学工业在这个国家中就有了广阔的发展前途。工人党第二次代表大会把发展化学工业作为一项特别重要的任务。为了建立强大的化学工业基础，去年化学工业投资占整个工业投资的20％，比1958年增加了50％。在去年有许多化学工厂和车间动工兴建或投入生产。去年第一次生产了人造纤维和芦苇纸浆等新产品。化肥和塑料的生产受到很大重视。同1958年比较，去年这两种产品的产量分别增加了约一倍到两倍多。罗马尼亚正在大力发展石油化学这个新的部门，除去正在全面施工的博尔泽斯蒂石油化学联合企业外，今后还将在普罗也什蒂、克拉约瓦和匈牙利族自治州等地建立一些大型的石油化学联合企业。
    今年将继续大规模地进行化学工业的基本建设和增加化学品的产量。今年工业总投资的五分之一以上将用于发展化学工业，这个部门的生产将比1959年增长22％。单是今年第一季度就将有九个化学工厂、车间或设备投入生产。今年纤维和人造纤维的生产将比去年增长三倍多，氮肥、塑料和树脂都将增长一倍多，而链霉素将增长十九倍。
    罗马尼亚的机器制造业已成为一个重要部门。目前，机器制造业生产着一千多种机器和设备。去年，机器制造业的生产大约比1958年增长了19．7％，大大超过了原订计划。去年生产了许多新产品，例如效率很高的双涡轮钻具，每分钟转速一千六百次的旋床，载重八十吨的自动卸货车厢和新式玉蜀黍联合收割机等。另外，在一些机器制造厂和造船厂的协作下，还制造了第一批内燃机车，两艘排水量各为四千五百吨的轮船（罗马尼亚目前自造的最大轮船）等。今年，机器制造业的生产将增长17％，其中石油设备将增长63％，拖拉机增长36％。
    罗马尼亚的电力工业在最近几年来获得突出成就。最近十年内建立了二十二个大的发电站。十年电气化计划（1951—1960）规定，在1960年电力生产达到七十亿度，这个任务在去年已接近完成。今年内“列宁”水电站将部分投入生产。最近几年还将在克拉约瓦和普罗也什蒂建立大型热电站，同捷克斯洛伐克合作建立发电量共四十亿度的一些电站。今年的电力生产将达到七十七亿度，比去年增长14％。
    罗马尼亚去年在建筑材料等工业方面也取得了巨大的成就。
    去年，罗马尼亚进行了大规模的基本建设工作，新建和扩建了许多平炉、高炉、炼焦炉、轧钢车间，以及化学、木材加工、制糖、纺织等工厂和车间。去年还修建了两万一千套住宅。去年基本建设的特点是集中使用投资和材料，加快了建设速度。第一建筑公司在九个月中就修建了一千套住宅，“列宁”水电站等工地都是日夜施工。去年有不少基建项目都提前投入了生产。乔治乌—德治同志去年在工人党十二月中央全会上指出，必须加快现有基本建设工程的速度，同时做好准备，在1960年头几个月中就能使许多大型工业工程动工兴建。今后大型企业的建设期限将缩短为两年到三年。去年在降低建筑成本方面取得了很大成绩。每套住宅的建筑费用已从1958年的六万八千多列伊降低到三万九千列伊。许多工程项目在钢筋、水泥的单位消耗量上都减少了。
    社会主义农业大发展
    罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会曾经规定，到1960年，社会主义农业部门在占有的土地面积和供应商品产品方面都要居于优势地位。这个任务在去年已经提前一年多完成了。社会主义农业部门的耕地面积现在已占全国耕地面积的72．2％（包括共耕社的耕地）；在国家农产品中央储备中，76％的麦类、67％的玉蜀黍、70％的向日葵和80％的甜菜都是社会主义农业部门供给的。这是农业合作组织和国营农场不断发展和巩固的结果，这标志着社会主义在农村中已取得了决定性的胜利。
    由于社会主义农业显示了巨大的优越性，党对农民的社会主义教育日益加强，近几年来罗马尼亚的农业合作化运动获得迅速发展。去年有七十五万农户加入了各种合作组织，这是农业合作化运动大发展的一年。到去年12月1日止，社会主义农业合作组织已包括二百六十一万多户，占全国农户的72．8％。党和政府不但积极引导农业合作运动不断发展，同时也很注意从组织上和经济上巩固新成立的集体农庄和共耕社。去年共耕社的公共财产比1958年大约增加了60％。在几年前，现金收入在一百万列伊以上的集体农庄还很少，但现在已有不少集体农庄的收入达到数百万列伊了。
    随着收入的不断增加，集体农庄的公共福利事业有很大发展。除去扩大了文化、卫生设施外，现在许多集体农庄都实行了养老金制度。这说明，许多集体农庄的收入现在已不仅能够满足有劳动力的庄员的目前需要，而且还能保证那些失去劳动能力的人的生活。去年工人党七月中央全会对这一措施表示支持，并责成党组织对这个问题加以研究，以便订出统一的养老金制度。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会和部长会议在去年曾经作出加强党对国营农场的领导和监督、改进国营农场的经济工作的决议。在执行这个决议的过程中，曾经从工厂和机关抽调了大批有经验的干部参加国营农场的领导工作。去年每个国营农场都实行了经济核算制。国营农场去年在改进劳动组织方面取得很大成绩。综合机械化耕作队已经增加到八百二十个。这种耕作队一般是五个人使用五部拖拉机，固定在五百公顷土地上工作。这种劳动组织形式在提高单位面积产量和降低生产成本方面显示了优越性。同国营农场的平均单位面积产量比较，综合机械化耕作队的产量高26％—65％，而成本低30％到35％。
    上面的一些措施对国营农场的发展起了很大作用。一些在过去有亏损的农场现在已经成为盈利的单位。1957年，克拉约瓦州国营农场的主要农作物平均单位面积产量全部低于集体农庄，甚至有的作物的产量低于个体农民。但在去年，这种不正常情况已经有了根本改变，国营农场的农作物单位面积产量几乎全部高于集体农庄、共耕社和个体农民。国营农场向国家提供的农产品和畜产品也显著增加了。去年全国国营农场向国家供应的小麦和稞麦超计划十六万八千吨。
    在社会主义农业蓬勃发展的基础上，去年罗马尼亚的粮食总产量约比1958年增加了50％。粮食作物的单位面积产量也比丰收的1957年高。去年能获得这样好的收成是因为农业劳动者响应了1958年11月和去年7月工人党两次中央全会关于提高单位面积产量和降低农产品成本的号召，许多国营农场、集体农庄、共耕社都参加了丰产竞赛运动。他们采取了深耕、多施肥、及时播种、加强田间管理等技术措施。去年在兴修水利和土壤改良方面所取得的巨大成就对丰收起了一定作用。去年一年内，灌溉面积将近增加了一倍，同时还在三十万公顷土地上进行了防洪、排涝工作，其中十万公顷土地上的工作已经完成。这些成就是在群众运动的基础上取得的。拖拉机和其他农业机器的迅速增长也是去年获得丰收的一个重要因素。去年拖拉机的数目已经增加到五万二千台（每台十五马力），其他农业机器也有大量增加。
    罗马尼亚大国民议会主席团在去年春天发布的关于消灭农业中任何剥削形式残余的法令已经贯彻执行。农村中的最后一个剥削阶级——富农阶级已被消灭，这对发展农村中的社会主义建设具有极其深远的意义。
    深入群众　面向生产
    工人党1958年11月和去年7月、12月举行的三次中央全会都强调党组织必须加强对经济工作的领导。各经济部门在去年都贯彻了党的这个指示，党的工作同生产活动联系得更加密切了。经济领导工作中的保守主义思想受到了批判。党组织和党员在群众中进行了广泛的政治思想工作，动员广大职工参加生产竞赛运动。同时，党组织还同行政领导、技术人员一起解决生产中的具体问题。去年，党对农业生产的领导也加强了。州、县党委的领导人都分工负责领导一定地区的农业生产和合作化运动。
    去年在文化教育方面出现了许多新气象。教育为社会主义建设服务的方针得到了切实贯彻。工程技术学科的学生的实践活动大大增加了。他们和一些工厂订立了合同，经常到工厂中实习，同工人一起解决生产中的问题。底密索拉州工学院建筑系的学生自己设计和修建了一座四层的办公大楼。
    去年对学生的政治教育和劳动教育取得了很好的效果。社会主义劳动青年联盟中央号召每个青年每年要义务劳动一百个小时，许多青年的义务劳动时间都超过了这个标准。在去年暑假期间，成万的大学生和中学生都到工地或农村参加了义务劳动。他们认识到劳动是一件光荣的事情。去年全国就有八十多万青年参加了爱国工作队，进行了各种义务劳动。
    在过去的一年中，许多作家、艺术家更加深入生活、联系群众了。他们根据社会主义现实主义的准则创作了不少优秀作品。去年新出版的许多文学著作多半是取材于党在过去领导人民进行英勇的斗争或目前的伟大社会主义建设。去年有许多作家下乡下厂，加强同劳动人民的联系，他们曾同十万名工农业劳动者会见。在巴科州国家剧院青年演员的倡议下，有许多演员都到农村演出并协助农民开展文化活动。最近还将有一些艺术家到工业中心去体验工人的生活。

    1960年是罗马尼亚执行即将制订的国家六年计划的第一年。工人党在去年12月举行的中央全会为全国劳动人民提出了今年的奋斗目标，全国劳动人民正在以高涨的劳动热情为这一目标而奋斗，用他们的新的生产成就迎接将在今年春天举行的工人党第三次代表大会。
