    Combine Water Conservancy Construction with Building Water Power Stations
    Equipping agriculture with modern technology and equipment to achieve agricultural modernization is the fundamental way to increase agricultural labor productivity and liberate rural labor. However, given that China's industry is currently unable to provide a large number of agricultural machines and fully meet the agricultural demand for modern technology and equipment, and that there is a shortage of rural labor, the first step is to implement tool reform and use water power to replace human and animal power. This is a practical and effective way to improve labor productivity. In this regard, Xiapu County in Fujian and Daxin County in Guangxi, among others, have made achievements and gained experience.
    Using water power means utilizing the drop of rivers, streams, and canals to install water turbines to generate power. This power can drive rice mills, pulping machines, threshing machines, circular saws, etc., which can be used to mill rice, thresh grain, make paper pulp, and saw wood, saving a large amount of human and animal power needed for processing agricultural and sideline products.
    Such a water power station can be built as long as there is a flow rate of 0.2 cubic meters per second and a drop of 1.5 meters (or even less). That is to say, not only can water power stations be built on rivers with abundant water sources and large drops, but also on ordinary mountain streams, small rivers, and ditches, and even on flat flowing water by building dams to create drops. The structure of water turbines is also very simple, and they can be made of wood, which is inexpensive and uses very little material. At the same time, water turbines use water power and do not require fuel. They only need a little lubricating oil every day to drive processing tools, which is much more economical than using diesel engines or gas engines. A small water power station can be built for only a few dozen or a hundred yuan by purchasing some necessary bearings, iron main shafts, belts, etc.
    Water power stations are easy to build, save money and materials, but the power they provide is very large. For example, the water power stations in Daxin County generally have ten to dozens of horsepower, which can be used for sawing boards, grinding flour, milling rice, squeezing sugar, and making paper pulp. In the past, it took one person a whole day to pound fifty catties of rice by hand on average. Now, using a water turbine to drive a rice mill, if it is a No. 2 rice mill, two people can manage it and mill 16,000 catties of rice in ten hours, increasing efficiency by 160 times. According to calculations, if all 93 water power stations in Daxin County are put into production and comprehensively utilized, more than 12,000 laborers can be saved, which is equivalent to 15% of the county's existing labor force. The liberated labor force, whether invested in agricultural production or diversified operations, will greatly promote the development of these undertakings and promote the prosperity of the rural economy. Not only that, water power stations also create conditions and lay the foundation for agricultural mechanization and electrification. The current water power stations, as long as they are equipped with generators, can become hydropower stations. During the day, electricity can be used as power to drive agricultural machinery for processing and production, and at night, electricity can be generated for lighting.
    From this, it can be seen that building water power stations is a good way to solve the current shortage of rural labor and improve labor productivity, and it is also a powerful measure to prepare for agricultural mechanization and electrification, which is worthy of great promotion.
    Since water power stations play such a large role, we should do everything possible to develop them. To develop water power stations, in addition to utilizing existing rivers and streams, we must also combine them with the water conservancy construction movement. That is to say, when building water conservancy projects, we should not only consider the issues of irrigation and drought and flood prevention, but also consider the comprehensive utilization of water energy; that is to say, we should not only ask water for food, but also ask water for power. It is hoped that all localities will seize the opportunity, proceed from specific conditions, and build a number of water power stations in conjunction with water conservancy construction.

    结合修水利大建水力站
    用现代技术设备武装农业，实现农业现代化，是提高农业劳动生产率，解放农村劳动力的根本出路。但是，在目前我国的工业还不能提供大量的农业机器，还不能充分满足农业对现代技术设备的要求，而农村劳动力又很紧张的情况下，首先实行工具改革，用水力作为动力来代替人力、畜力，是提高劳动生产率的切实的有效的办法。在这方面，福建霞浦县、广西大新县等地已经做出成绩，取得经验。
    用水力作动力，就是利用江河、溪流、水渠的落差，安装水轮机产生动力。用这种动力带动碾米机、打浆机、脱粒机、圆盘锯等，就可以碾米、脱粒、打纸浆、锯木头，就可以节省下农副产品加工所需要的大量人力和畜力。
    这种水力动力站，只要有零点二的流量、一点五米（甚至更低）的落差就可以建站。也就是说，不仅是水源丰富、落差大的江河能够建立水力动力站，就是一般的山溪、小河、沟渠都可以建立，甚至平流水也可以筑坝截流造成落差，建立水力站。水轮机的构造也很简单，而且可以用木头制造，成本低廉，用料很省。同时，水轮机是利用水力，不用燃料，每天只需要用一点点润滑油，就可带动加工工具，这比用柴油机、煤气机要节省得多。一个小型水力动力站，大约只需花几十元或一百多元，购买一些必要的轴承、铁主轴、皮带等就可建成。
    水力动力站建站容易，省钱、省物，可是它所提供的动力却很大。如大新县的水力站，一般拥有十马力到几十马力的动力，可以锯板、磨粉、碾米、榨糖、打纸浆等。过去用人工舂米，平均每人一天只能舂五十斤，改用水轮机带动碾米机碾谷，如果带的是一个二号碾米机，两个人管理，十小时就可碾米一万六千斤，效率提高了一百六十倍。据计算，如果大新县的九十三个水力站全部投入生产，实行综合利用，就可节约出劳动力一万二千多个，相当于这个县现有劳力的15％。解放出来的这批劳力，无论是投入农业生产，还是投入多种经营，都将大大促进这些事业的发展，促进农村经济的繁荣。不仅如此，水力动力站还为农业的机械化和电气化创造了条件，打下了基础。现在的水力站，只要装上发电机，就可以成为水电站，白天利用电力作为动力，带动农业机器加工生产，黑夜发电照明。
    由此可见，建立水力动力站，是目前解决农村劳动力不足、提高劳动生产率的好办法，也是为农业机械化、电气化进行准备的有力措施，值得大大提倡。
    水力动力站的作用既然这样大，就应当想尽一切办法来发展它。要发展水力动力站，除了利用已有的江河溪流以外，还要和水利建设运动结合起来。就是说，在修水利的时候，不仅要考虑到灌溉和防旱、防涝的问题，而且要考虑到水能的综合利用问题；也就是说，不但要向水要粮食，而且要向水要动力。希望各地抓紧时机，从具体条件出发，结合兴修水利建立一批水力动力站。
