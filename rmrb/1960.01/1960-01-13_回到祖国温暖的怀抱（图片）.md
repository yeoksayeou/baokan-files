Returning to the Warm Embrace of the Motherland

On January 6th, 802 overseas Chinese, warmly received by people from all walks of life in the motherland, returned to Shenzhen. Over a hundred reception personnel, doctors, and nurses warmly and attentively cared for the returned overseas Chinese. Those lacking warm clothing were given new cotton-padded clothes by the people of the motherland, and the sick received excellent care. Some of the returned overseas Chinese shed tears of emotion, while others excitedly said: "The motherland is so warm! We are no longer orphans abroad."

    回到祖国温暖的怀抱
    1月6日，有八百零二名华侨，在祖国各界人民的热情接待下，回到了深圳。接待人员和医生、护士一百多人，热情周到地照料归侨。短缺寒衣的侨胞穿上了祖国人民送给的新棉衣，病人更得到了很好的照顾。归侨中有人感动的流下了热泪，有人激动地说：“祖国多么温暖呀！我们再不是海外孤儿了。”
