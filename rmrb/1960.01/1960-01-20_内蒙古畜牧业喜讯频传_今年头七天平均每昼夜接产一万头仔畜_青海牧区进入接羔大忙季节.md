Xinhua News Agency Report: Good news keeps pouring in from the animal husbandry front in Inner Mongolia, where the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" campaign has achieved initial success.

In the first seven days of this year, herdsmen and farmers in the autonomous region delivered an average of over 10,000 young animals per day and night, creating a good start for the continued leap forward in animal husbandry production this year. Adding to the more than 700,000 young animals delivered before the new year, herdsmen throughout the region have recently delivered over 810,000 young animals, doubling the number delivered around the new year in 1959, with a survival rate of 96.3%.

The "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" campaign on the animal husbandry front in Inner Mongolia has been ongoing for over a month. During this period, herdsmen have adopted a series of measures to protect the condition of livestock, ensure successful pregnancies, assist in lambing, and nurture young animals, achieving great success. Herdsmen on the Ordos grasslands, who first initiated the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" campaign, have delivered 140,699 offspring from 140,149 ewes. Among them, 139,670 have survived, with a survival rate of 99.26%. At the same time, herdsmen have also selected more than 35,000 strong and well-conditioned ewes that have given birth to lambs for secondary breeding. These ewes will produce at least another 31,000 lambs this summer.

This year, the autonomous region has prepared more and better materials for livestock to survive the winter and spring than in previous years. At present, the people's communes throughout the region have stored more than 600 million catties more fodder than last year. Herdsmen have built more than 280,000 warm sheds and pens on the pastures, which can accommodate 10 million head of livestock. At the same time, the region has strengthened feeding management and veterinary prevention work, creating favorable conditions for the realization of "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring."

Xinhua News Agency Report: Qinghai pastoral areas have entered the busy season of lambing. According to incomplete statistics, the Qaidam area and the five Tibetan autonomous prefectures of Hainan, Haibei, Huangnan, Yushu, and Guoluo have already produced more than 188,000 winter lambs, with a survival rate of over 98%; among them, 480 ewes have produced twins or triplets.

The lambing season in various parts of Qinghai generally started about a month earlier than in previous years. In previous years, the survival rate of winter lambs was generally only 80% to 90%, but this year the survival rate of winter lambs has greatly increased. This is due to the full play of the superiority of the people's communes and the efforts of herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the Great Leap Forward last year to go all out and pay attention to the condition of the sheep. In the summer and autumn of last year, people's communes and state-owned farms generally reduced the size of livestock herds and strengthened feeding and management. More than 95% of the sheep in the province reached the first-class condition, and the third-class condition was eliminated. Since the beginning of winter, all localities have also done a better job in preparing for frost prevention and livestock protection and lambing and raising, generally preparing warm sheds for ewes that are giving birth to lambs, selecting good pastures, and storing fine feed such as oats and ferns. Dairy cows are also pre-equipped for lambs, and medicines for preventing lamb dysentery are prepared.

In order to promote the rapid conception of ewes after lambing, areas with suitable conditions are currently implementing artificial estrus and heat breeding for postpartum ewes. These ewes that have undergone artificial estrus and heat breeding can give birth to lambs again this summer.

Also, the Sujitan Commune in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, Qinghai Province, has done a good job in preventing frost damage to sheep. Recently, this commune created a method of building chimneys in the four corners of the sheepfold, which is beneficial for frost prevention, wolf prevention, pregnancy protection, raising young animals, and protecting the condition of the livestock. Now nearly a hundred sheepfolds in the Huangcheng and Zhasa brigades have been equipped with chimneys. In the past, the sheep were covered with frost in the early morning, and their whiskers were covered with many small icicles, but now they are gone; the sheep no longer crowd together to keep warm at night, which is of great help in protecting the condition of the livestock and protecting pregnancy. At night, the smoke in the enclosure is steaming, and the wolves dare not come.

This method was conceived by the cadres and herdsmen of the Huangcheng Brigade based on the idea that smoking crops can prevent frost damage. They built a chimney and stove in each of the four corners of the circle, burning dry sheep manure and cow dung at night, and increasing it at dawn when frost falls to increase the temperature inside the circle. They set the fire door outside the circle wall so that the sheep will not be disturbed when adding fuel, and they also educate the herdsmen to prevent fires. After the successful trial of this method, the herdsmen of Huangcheng Brigade and Zhasa Brigade made a night raid to build chimneys and stoves and promoted this method. (Attached picture)

### 内蒙古畜牧业喜讯频传  今年头七天平均每昼夜接产一万头仔畜  青海牧区进入接羔大忙季节

    内蒙古畜牧业喜讯频传
    今年头七天平均每昼夜接产一万头仔畜
    青海牧区进入接羔大忙季节
    据新华社讯　在新的一年里，内蒙古畜牧业战线上的“百母百子”运动旗开得胜，草原频传丰收喜讯。
    今年头七天，自治区牧民和农民平均每昼夜接产一万多头子畜，为今年畜牧业生产继续跃进创造了良好的开端。加上年前接产的七十多万头子畜，全区牧民最近已经接产了八十一万多头幼畜，比1959年新年前后增加了一倍，幼畜的成活率达到96．3％。
    内蒙古畜牧业战线上的“百母百子”运动已经持续了一个多月。在这期间，牧民们采取了一系列保膘、保胎、接羔和保育措施，获得很大成绩。首倡“百母百子”运动的鄂尔多斯草原上的牧民，已经从十四万零一百四十九只母羊中，接产了十四万零六百九十九只幼子。其中，保育成活十三万九千六百七十只，成活率达99．26％。同时，牧民们还挑选了三万五千多只体壮膘好的产羔母羊，作了第二次配种。这批母羊到今年夏季至少还能产三万一千多只羔。
    今年，自治区为牲畜过冬渡春准备的物资比往年又多又好。目前全区各人民公社贮备的饲草比去年多六亿多斤。牧民们在牧场上新建了二十八万多个暖棚暖圈，可以容纳一千万头牲畜。同时，全区加强了饲养管理和兽医防治工作，为实现“百母百子”创造了良好条件。
    据新华社讯　青海牧业区进入接育羊羔工作的大忙季节。据不完全统计，柴达木地区和海南、海北、黄南、玉树、果洛五个藏族自治州已产冬羔十八万八千多只，成活率达98％以上；其中有四百八十只母羊产了双羔或三羔。
    青海各地这一季产羔期普遍比往年提早一个月左右。往年冬羔的成活率一般只有80％到90％，今年冬羔成活率大大提高。这是由于充分发挥了人民公社的优越性和各族牧民在去年大跃进中鼓足干劲、抓好羊膘的结果。各人民公社和国营牧场在去年夏秋两季，普遍划小了畜群，加强了饲放管理，全省羊只的一类膘达到95％以上，消灭了三类膘。入冬以来，各地对防冻保畜工作和接羔育幼的准备工作也做得比较好，普遍给产羔母羊准备了暖棚，选了好草场，储备了燕麦、蕨麻等精料。还给羔羊事先配备奶牛，制好防治羔羊痢疾的药剂等。
    为了促使母羊产羔后很快又能受孕，有条件的地区目前都对产后母羊实行人工催情和热胎配种。这些经过人工催情和热胎配种的母羊，在今年夏季又可以产羔一次。
    又讯　青海门源回族自治县苏吉滩公社羊只防冻工作做得好。最近这个公社创造了在羊圈四角垒烟囱的办法，对防冻、防狼、保胎、育幼、保膘都有好处。现在皇城、扎萨大队将近一百个羊圈都安上了烟囱。以前，清晨羊身上满是霜花，胡须上挂着许多小冰棒，现在见不到了；羊子在夜晚也不再挤着取暖，对保膘、保胎有很大作用。夜里圈内烟气腾腾，狼也不敢来。
    这个办法是皇城大队的干部和放牧员根据农作物熏烟可以防冻的道理想出来的。他们在圈的四角各垒一烟囱和火灶，夜晚燃着干羊粪和牛粪，并在黎明降霜时加大，提高圈内温度。他们把火门设在圈墙外，这样添燃料时不惊动羊群，并且教育放牧员防止火灾。这个办法试验成功以后，皇城大队和扎萨大队的放牧员连夜突击垒烟囱、火灶，推广了这一方法。（附图片）
