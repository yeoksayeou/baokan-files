    Note from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs to the Chinese Embassy in India on the Sino-Indian Border Issue on November 4, 1959

    To the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in New Delhi:
    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of India presents its compliments to the Embassy of the People's Republic of China and begs to refer to the Note handed to the Indian Ambassador in Peking by the Chinese Vice-Minister on October 25th. The Government of India has also seen the statement issued by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Peking on October 26th. The Government of India regrets to say that the Chinese Government’s account of the incidents in its Note to the Indian Ambassador and the more detailed repetition in the statement issued by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs are completely at variance with the facts and are a distortion of the truth. The Government of India has made a full investigation into the matter and has received a detailed report from the Indian police officer who was the second-in-command of the Indian police party at the time of the attack by Chinese troops on October 20th and 21st and who later returned to the nearest Indian outpost. A copy of this officer’s report is enclosed with this Note. The brave commander of the police party has sacrificed himself in the conflict.

    2. The Government of India not only rejects the Chinese Government’s account of the facts of the incident but also repudiates some of the assumptions underlying it. The suggestion that an Indian police party equipped only with rifles and placed in an unfavorable position would attack Chinese troops equipped with heavy weapons and entrenched on a commanding height with mortars and grenades is unacceptable to any reasonable person. All the circumstances of the incident and the detailed information in our possession contradict the version presented by the Chinese Government.

    3. The attached material regarding the tragic events at Kongka Pass – a first-hand report from the responsible officer – clearly demonstrates that Indian personnel did not at any time on October 20th or 21st adopt an aggressive posture. They were subjected to a brutal attack by Chinese troops with rifles, mortars, and grenades while they were conducting a patrol. One contingent of the attacking force was apparently entrenched on a hill, while another was on the opposite bank of the Kongka River to the right. Although the Indian police party returned fire in self-defense, they could not withstand the superior strength of the Chinese troops, who had the advantage of strategic position and superior weaponry. The Chinese Government has not stated the precise number of casualties suffered by the attacking Chinese troops, but it has indicated that their casualties were much lower than those of the Indian police party. The Government of India completely disagrees with the extraordinary conclusion drawn by the Chinese Government from the heavy casualties suffered by Indian personnel that the Indian police party had adopted an offensive posture. The obvious conclusion should be the opposite, indicating that the Chinese troops were the attacking party because they were entrenched on a hill and used mortars and grenades.

    4. This incident must also be viewed in the context of previous incidents and the exchange of correspondence between the Governments of India and China. As is well known, the entire length of the Indian border is a traditional border and is accurately marked on official maps published by the Survey of India. There has never been any doubt about this border. In the past few years, the Indian Prime Minister has repeatedly and clearly declared this border. The Government of the People's Republic of China has remained silent about this border for several years. When the Indian Government noted that some vague Chinese maps appearing in magazines inaccurately depicted large areas as part of China, the Indian Government raised objections. The answer received was that these maps were old maps published by the old Chinese regime and that the current government of China was busy with other activities and could not consider revising these maps. This answer itself shows that, apart from perhaps some minor disputes, the Chinese Government did not have serious doubts about the correctness of the Indian maps. As has been brought to the attention of the Chinese Government in the past, the Prime Minister of the People's Republic of China personally told the Indian Prime Minister that the Chinese Government was prepared to accept the northeastern border of India known as the McMahon Line. From Indian maps, from statements made on behalf of India, and from the actual situation, the Chinese Government, although it must have been very clear where the border between the Tibet region and Ladakh was, has never raised any questions about this section of the border all these years. The 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement was intended to address all outstanding issues between India and the Tibet region of China that had been left over from the British era. However, neither in the long and detailed discussions before the signing of the agreement nor in the agreement itself did the Chinese Government mention its claim to such a large area of Indian territory. It was only in Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to the Indian Prime Minister on September 8, 1959, that the Chinese Government first made a claim to territory vaguely included in its maps. This statement is inconsistent with previous statements about the Chinese map issue. It is noteworthy that to date, the Chinese Government has never made any specific statement indicating exactly where its border lies according to its own opinion. Even its own maps have marked completely different and fluctuating borders.

    5. As far as the Indian Government is concerned, its position has been clear and unambiguous from the beginning, and indeed for many years, and there has never been any doubt about it. Paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the Indian Prime Minister’s letter to Premier Zhou Enlai on September 26th explain this position in detail. In that letter, the Indian Prime Minister provided the historical background of the traditional Sino-Indian border and the basis for the depiction of its various sections on Indian official maps. In fact, anyone with some knowledge not only of recent events but also of the history of the past few hundred years knows that India’s traditional and historical border is linked to India’s culture and tradition for more than two thousand years and has become an integral part of Indian life and thought.

    6. Therefore, the Government of India rejects and repudiates the various assumptions made by the Chinese Government in its note regarding this long border. The Government of India reiterates that the area where the conflict occurred is not only part of Indian territory but is also deep within India. The Government of India cannot accept the Chinese Government's claim that the entire area, including the area east, south, and north of Kongka Pass, "has always been Chinese territory and is under the jurisdiction of the Xinjiang region and the Tibet region." This claim is contrary to history and fact. Maps published by the Survey of India since 1867-68 have always depicted the border between Ladakh and the Xinjiang and Tibet regions in the same way as the official maps currently published by the Survey of India. This border runs northeast from the Karakoram Pass, passes through the Qara Tagh Pass, and then runs along the Kunlun Mountains from fifteen miles north of Haji Langar to Peak 21250 (Survey of India map) located east of 80 degrees east longitude. This line constitutes the watershed between India’s Indus River system and China’s Hotan River system. The border turns south from point 21250, following the western watershed of the rivers flowing into lakes within Chinese territory until the Lanak Pass. Further south, the border from the Lanak Pass to the Chang Pass has been described in the Note from the Indian Embassy in Beijing to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 13, 1959. As the Note stated, the international boundary follows the eastern and southern watershed of the Chang Chenmo River and the southern watershed of the Chip Chap River, then along the southern bank of the Chip Chap River and the eastern bank of the Chang Lung Yog River. The boundary line skirts the western end of the eastern half of Pangong Lake (called Lake Erh on Chinese maps), then along the watershed of the Ang River and through Spanggur Lake, and then along the northeastern and northern watershed of the Indus River.

    7. It can be seen from this that for nearly a hundred years, Indian official maps have marked the international border in the same way as it is today. In fact, detailed surveys of this area have been carried out since 1867-68, and the border marked on our maps not only conforms to tradition and custom but is also based on the results of these surveys. The area on the Indian side of this border was surveyed by Hayward, Shaw, and Carey in 1868, Bower in 1891, and Aurel Stein in 1900. Dru, the Governor of Ladakh under the Maharaja of Kashmir, officially inspected this area up to the northern border in 1871, and the map attached to his book "Jammu and Kashmir Territories, 1875," as well as the Jammu and Kashmir gazetteers published from 1890 and the maps attached to the 1908 Imperial Gazetteer of India, all depict the border in a manner similar to the border marked on today’s Indian official maps. It is the Chinese maps of this area that have marked different lines at different times. A Chinese official map of 1893 included the Aksai Chin area in India. The 1935 Shen Bao Atlas of China included a large part of the Chang Chenmo area in India. In fact, according to this map, the site of the recent conflict is within India. This map and later Chinese maps up to 1951 placed the international border thirty to sixty miles east of the Shyok River, and parallel to it. It was only in 1951 that a few Chinese maps moved the border to within ten to thirty miles east of the Shyok River, and parallel to it. Most Chinese maps until 1954, and one as late as 1956, still depicted the border in the Pangong Lake area as running through the western end of the eastern half of Pangong Lake (called Lake Erh on Chinese maps). The aforementioned few Chinese maps of 1951 drew the line through the lakebed of the western half of Pangong Lake, thus including the Spanggur area and part of the Pangong area in Tibet.

    8. The Government of India did not in fact establish border posts along the traditional border. This is because the area is sparsely populated, almost uninhabited, and the Government of India had no reason to anticipate any aggressive intentions on the part of the Chinese Government. Therefore, in previous years, the Government of India considered it sufficient to send regular police patrols to these areas. The Government of India cannot accept the statement made by the Chinese Government in its statement published in the press on October 26 that "the border defense forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have been stationed and patrolling in this entire area." Indian survey and reconnaissance teams traveling from Leh to the Lanak Pass in 1954 and 1956 did not find any signs of Chinese occupation. The first signs of foreign intrusion were discovered in 1957 in Xinglong and some places further north. Apparently, the intrusion into these places must have occurred for the first time in 1957. Other Indian reconnaissance teams, going all the way to the Karakoram Pass, did not encounter any Chinese personnel. No Indian reconnaissance teams were sent to the Aksai Chin area where the Chinese authorities were building a new road. However, no adverse conclusions can be drawn simply from the fact that China built this road. The road construction was carried out without the knowledge of the Indian Government. As early as 1899, the then Indian Government told the Beijing authorities the location of the international border in this area, and the then border location was almost the same as today, as mentioned above; for nearly a century, Indian official maps have marked the Aksai Chin area as part of India. It is extremely difficult to enter this area from the populated western and southern Ladakh, and the Indian Government had no reason to suspect that the Chinese Government, which maintained friendly relations with it, would intrude into this area to build a road.

    9. The Government of India has not yet received a reply to the long and detailed letter from the Indian Prime Minister to Premier Zhou Enlai on September 26, 1959. Disregarding the facts stated in that letter, the Chinese Government's troops not only committed aggression again but also attacked an Indian police party engaged in normal patrol duties. This is the second armed attack on Indian personnel, the last one occurring in Longju, where Chinese troops forcibly crossed the Indian border. These facts, taken together with the continuous aggressive attitude adopted throughout the border and the current propaganda made on behalf of the Chinese Government, are reminiscent of the activities of the old-line imperialist powers against which India and China have fought in the past. It is deeply regrettable that the Chinese Government, which has so often condemned imperialism, should take actions so contrary to its own words. It is even more regrettable that the Five Principles and the Bandung Conference declaration have been so mocked by the Chinese Government.

    10. The Government of India is surprised that the Chinese Government’s Note makes a point of criticizing the publication of an Indian official communique on the incident. The Government of India had no reason to keep the Indian people ignorant of such serious events. The Chinese Government must be aware that there is strong feeling in India not only on the general question of the Indian border but particularly on the present incident. In fact, the Government of India issued the communique only after discovering that the account given in the Chinese Government’s Note handed to the Indian Ambassador on October 25th was completely at variance with the facts.

    11. The Government of India does not propose to discuss in detail the other matters mentioned in the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement of October 26th. The Government of India emphatically rejects the suggestion that Indian troops have upset the status quo in several places on the Sino-Indian border or that Indian troops have occupied any places within Chinese territory. The facts about the border have been set out in detail in the Indian Prime Minister’s letter of September 26th. Paragraphs 12 to 16 of that letter refer to the traditional border in the northeast, sometimes called the McMahon Line. It will be seen from these paragraphs that there is no basis whatever for the Chinese claim to any territory south of this line. Any incursion by Chinese personnel into this area would amount to a deliberate violation of Indian territory.

    12. The Government of India has always been willing to respect the traditional border between India and China, and in fact has done so. However, the Government of India cannot recognize any line that would include areas on the Indian side of the traditional border in the Ladakh region or elsewhere as part of China. For a long time, this border has been peaceful. Accidents and conflicts have only occurred recently because Chinese troops have been pushing forward to the border in many places and have crossed the border in some places to carry out aggression.

    13. The Chinese Government rightly emphasizes the importance of maintaining the status quo. An essential prerequisite for maintaining the status quo is that neither side should disregard the traditional border, seek to expand its occupation, or maintain a hypothetical right, and in no case should resort to force unless as a last resort in self-defense. If the Chinese troops had respected this fundamental fact, this regrettable incident which caused such heavy casualties to Indian personnel could have been avoided.

    14. It is recognized throughout the world that India stands for peace and is completely opposed to the use of war to settle international disputes. The Indian people persisted in using peaceful methods even in their struggle for independence. India’s attitude towards the Chinese Government and people has always been friendly. This is not only consistent with India’s well-known policy but also because the Indian people and government believe that for the sake of India and China, and for the sake of peace in Asia and the world, these two great Asian nations must maintain friendly relations, even though their domestic political structures may be different. The Government of India has been working towards this goal all these years. Therefore, the Government of India is extremely saddened that its hopes have been dashed and that a situation has been created that endangers the peaceful and friendly relations that exist between these two great nations, which it had hoped would continue to exist.

    15. The Government of India is particularly regretful that just as the world seems to be finally moving towards a peaceful resolution of the serious problems that have plagued it for the past twelve years, and just as the two great powers of the Soviet Union and the United States are making their best efforts to end the Cold War, violence and aggression have occurred again on India’s borders. Asian countries are ardent advocates of peace and have played a significant role in the work of seeking peace. At this crucial juncture in world history, Asian countries should not only advocate peace but also promote peace through their own attitudes and activities.

    16. In accordance with its firm policy, India will continue to strive to resolve all disputes by peaceful means, but where aggression occurs, the Indian people will inevitably have to resist by all possible means. The Indian people have waged a long struggle for the freedom of India’s independence and integrity, and they cannot allow any harm or infringement to it. Therefore, the Government of India believes that the Chinese Government will withdraw its troops from Indian territory and seek to resolve minor border disputes by peaceful means.

    17. Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of its highest consideration.

### 印度外交部在1959年11月4日就中印边界问题给中华人民共和国驻印度大使馆的照会

    印度外交部在1959年11月4日就中印边界问题
    给中华人民共和国驻印度大使馆的照会
    新华社2日讯　印度外交部在1959年11月4日就中印边界问题给中华人民共和国驻印度大使馆一件照会。照会全文如下：新德里中华人民共和国大使馆
    印度政府外交部向中华人民共和国大使馆致意，并谨请参照10月25日中国副部长交给印度驻北京大使的来照。印度政府也看到了中国外交部10月26日在北京发表的声明。印度政府不得不遗憾地说，中国政府给印度大使的照会对事件的叙述和中国外交部发表的声明所更详细地重复了的叙述，是完全和事实不符的，是对真理的歪曲。印度政府对此事进行了充分的调查并且已收到印度警官对10月20日、21日事件的详细报告，当印度警察队受到中国军队攻击时，这个警官是印度警察队的第二司令官，他后来回到了最近的印度哨所。该警官的报告附在本照会之后。指挥该警察队的英勇的司令官，已在冲突中牺牲。
    二、印度政府不仅拒绝中国政府对这个事件的事实的叙述，并且还驳斥其中的某些假设。所谓只配备步枪而且处于不利地位的印度警察队竟会攻击配备重武器的、居高临下地固守在一座小山顶上并且携有迫击炮和手榴弹的中国军队的说法，是任何有理智的人所不能接受的。所有与此事件有关的情况和我们所掌握的详细情报，都与中国政府所提供的说法相矛盾。
    三、后附关于羌臣摩谷悲剧性事件的材料——它是一位负责官员的第一手的报告——清楚地表明印度人员并没有在10月20日或21日的任何时候采取过侵略性的态度。他们在进行巡逻时突然遭受到中国军队用步枪、迫击炮和手榴弹的残酷的攻击。进攻军队的一支部队显然据守在一座小山顶上，而另一支部队则在右边羌臣摩河的对岸。虽然印度警察队为自卫而开枪，但是他们无法对抗借助于战略地位和优势武器的中国军队的优势力量。中国政府没有说明进攻的中国军队遭受伤亡的确切数目，但是表明他们所受的伤亡比印度警察队少得多。印度政府完全不同意中国政府从印度人员遭受重大伤亡一事中所得出的所谓印度警察队采取了攻势的异乎寻常的结论。明显的结论应该是与此相反，应该表明中国军队是进攻的一方，因为他们是据守在一座小山顶上并且使用了迫击炮和手榴弹。
    四、还必须联系以前的其他事件和印度政府和中国政府之间的来往信件来看这一次事件。众所周知，印度边界的全线都是传统的边界，并且精确地标明在印度测量局出版的官方地图上。对于这条边界不曾有过怀疑。过去几年中，印度总理屡次坚定地和清楚地宣布过这条边界。中华人民共和国政府几年来对这条边界没有啃声。当印度政府注意到出现在杂志中的一些含糊的中国地图不精确地将大片地区画为中国的一部分时，印度政府对此提出了反对。得到的回答是，这些地图是中国旧政权出版的老地图，中国的现政府忙于其他活动，还不能考虑修改这些地图的问题。这个回答本身表明，除了或许有一些小的争论以外，中国政府对印度地图的正确性没有严重的怀疑。正如过去提请中国政府注意的一样，中华人民共和国总理亲自对印度总理说过，中国政府准备接受被称为麦克马洪线的印度东北边界。从印度的地图、从代表印度所发表的声明和从实际的情况当中，中国政府虽然一定很清楚西藏地方和拉达克之间的边界在什么地方，但所有这些年来从未对这段边界提出过问题。1954年中印协定意在处理英国时期遗留下来的印度和中国西藏地方之间的全部悬而未决的问题。但是，无论在协定签订前长而详细的讨论当中或者在协定本身里，中国政府都未曾提到过它对印度领土这样大片地区的要求。只是在1959年9月8日周恩来总理给印度总理的信中，中国政府才第一次对含糊地包括在它的地图之中的领土提出了要求。这种说法是同以前关于中国地图问题的说法不符的。值得注意的是，到现在为止中国政府从未作出过任何确切的声明，说明按照它自己的意见，它的边界究竟在什么地方。甚至它自己的地图上也划过完全不同的、变动的边界。
    五、就印度政府来说，它的立场从一开始，而且事实上多年来都是清楚明确的，对此从来没有过怀疑。印度总理9月26日给周恩来总理的信的第五、六、七、八、九和十段详细地说明了这个立场。印度总理在那封信中提供了传统的中印边界的历史背景以及印度官方地图对它的各段的画法的根据。事实上，任何不仅对最近的情况，而且对过去几百年的历史也有些知识的人，都知道印度这条传统的和历史的边界是同印度两千多年来的文化和传统有联系，而且已经成为印度生活和思想的密切的一部分。
    六、因此，印度政府拒绝并且驳斥中国政府来照中关于这条长的边界所作的各种假设。印度政府重申，发生冲突的地区不仅是印度领土的一部分而且是深处在印度境内。印度政府不能接受中国政府的说法，即所谓整个地区，包括空喀山口以东、以南和以北的地方，“从来就是中国的领土，分属新疆地方和西藏地方管辖”。这个说法是同历史和事实相违背的。印度测量局从1867—68年以来所出版的地图，一直把拉达克同新疆和西藏地方之间的边界画得和印度测量局目前所出版的官方地图一样。这条边界从喀喇昆仑山口走向东北，穿过喀拉塔格山口，然后沿着昆仑山脉从哈吉拦干以北十五英里处直到位在东经八十度以东的21250山峰（印度测量局地图）。这条线构成印度的印度河水系和中国的和阗河水系之间的分水岭。边界从21250点折向南，沿着流往中国境内湖中的河流的西边的分水岭直到拉那克山口。更南从拉那克山口到羌山口的边界，已在印度驻北京大使馆1959年8月13日给中国外交部的照会中加以说明。正如该照会所说，国际边界沿着羌臣摩河的东面和南面的分水岭和丘谋桑河南面的分水岭，然后沿着丘谋桑河的南岸和昌格隆格河的东岸。边界线绕过了班公湖（在中国地图上称做伊尔湖）东半部的西端，然后沿着安格河的分水岭，并穿过斯潘古尔湖，再沿着印度河东北面和北面的分水岭而行。
    七、由此可以看出，将近一百年来，印度官方地图一直把国际边界标明得和今天的一样。事实上，从1867—68年以来曾对这个地区进行详细的测量，我国地图上所标明的边界不仅符合传统和习惯，而且是根据这些测量的结果的。这条边界的印度一侧的地区曾由海华德、萧和凯利在1868年，鲍威尔在1891年和奥里尔·斯坦因在1900年测量过。在克什米尔土王统治下任拉达克总督的德鲁在1871年正式视察了这个地区直至北方边界，而附在他所著的“1875年查谟和克什米尔地区”一书后的地图，以及从1890年起出版的查谟和克什米尔地志和1908年帝国印度地志的附图，都把边界画得差不多类似今天印度官方地图所标明的边界。正是中国关于这个地区的地图，在不同的时候曾标明了不同的线。1893年的一张中国官方地图把阿克赛钦地区划入印度。1935年申报出版的中国新地图集把羌臣摩地区的一大部分划入印度。事实上，根据这张地图，发生最近的冲突的地点是在印度境内。这张地图和以后直到1951年的中国地图都把国际边界画在萨约克河以东三十到六十英里处，并与之平行。只是在1951年，少数中国地图才把边界移至萨约克河以东十到三十英里以内，并与之平行。中国大多数的地图直到1954年，有一张迟至1956年，还把班公湖地区的边界画为穿过班公湖（在中国地图上称做伊尔湖）东半部的西端。上述1951年的少数中国地图把线画作穿过班公湖西半部的湖床，因而把斯潘古尔地区和一部分班公地区划入了西藏。
    八、印度政府的确并没有在传统边界跟前设立边界哨所。这是因为这个地区人烟稀少，几近于无，而且印度政府没有理由预料中国政府方面会有任何侵略意图。因此，印度政府在前几年认为在这些地区定期派出警察巡逻队就够了。印度政府不能接受中国政府10月26日在报上所发表的声明中所谓“中国人民解放军的边防部队一直在这整个地区驻守和巡逻”的说法。在1954年和1956年从列城前往拉那克山口的印度测量队和侦察队并未发现任何中国占领的形迹。1957年在兴龙和更北的一些地方第一次发现了外人侵入的迹象。显然，对这些地方的入侵一定是1957年第一次发生的。旁的印度侦察队，一直走到喀喇昆仑山口都没有碰到任何中国人员。没有派遣过印度侦察队到中国当局修筑新公路的阿克赛钦地区去。然而，仅仅从中国修筑了这条公路的事实中，不能得出任何不利的结论。筑路是在印度政府不知道的情况下进行的。早在1899年，当时的印度政府就告诉过北京当局这个地区国际边界的位置，当时的边界位置和今天差不多，有如上述；将近一世纪来，印度官方地图都标明阿克赛钦地区是印度的一部分。从有人居住的拉达克西部和南部进入这个地区是极其困难的，而且印度政府没有理由怀疑和它保有友好关系的中国政府会侵越到这个地区来修筑一条公路。
    九、对于印度总理1959年9月26日给周恩来总理的长而详细的信，印度政府还没有得到答复。不顾这封信里所述的事实，中国政府的军队不仅再次进行侵略，而且攻击了一支在执行正常巡逻任务的印度警察队。这是对印度人员的第二次武装攻击，上一次发生在朗久，在那里中国军队强行越过了印度的边界。这些事实，同边界各地连续采取的侵略性的态度和目前代表中国政府所作的这种宣传一并看来，令人回想起印中两国过去进行斗争所反对的老牌帝国主义列强的活动。曾经如此经常地谴责帝国主义的中国政府，竟会采取与它自己的言论这样相反的行为，是一件令人深为遗憾的事。更其令人遗憾的是，五项原则和万隆会议的宣言竟这样被中国政府所嘲弄。
    十、中国政府的来照对就这个事件发表了一项印度官方公报一点提出了指责，印度政府对此感到惊奇。印度政府没有理由使印度人民对这样严重的事件无所知晓。中国政府一定知道，在印度不仅对印度边界问题而且特别是对这次事件，存在着强烈的情绪。事实上，只是在发现中国政府10月25日交给印度大使的照会中所叙述的完全与事实不符之后，印度政府才发表了公报。
    十一、印度政府不准备详细讨论中国外交部10月26日声明所提到的其他事项。印度政府着重地驳斥这种说法，即所谓印度军队在中印边界上的若干地方破坏了现状，或者印度军队占领了中国境内的任何地方。有关边界的事实已经详细地写在印度总理9月26日的信中。那封信的第12到16段谈到有时被称为麦克马洪线的东北方的传统边界。从这几段可以看出，中国在这条线以南要求任何领土是完全没有根据的。中国人员对这一地区的任何越入就等于蓄意侵犯印度的领土。
    十二、印度政府一直愿意尊重印度和中国之间的传统边界，并且事实上这样做了。但是，印度政府不能承认在拉达克地区或者其他地方要把传统边界的印度一边的地区划入中国的任何界线。长期以来，这条边界是和平的。因为中国军队在许多地方一直推进到边界上，并且在一些地方越过边界进行侵略，在那里最近才发生了事故和冲突。
    十三、中国政府正确地强调了维持现状的重要性。维持现状的一个必要的先决条件，就是双方都不应该不顾传统的边界，寻求扩大占领范围，来维护一项假设的权利，而且无论如何不应该诉诸武力，除非作为自卫的最后手段。如果中国军队尊重这一基本事实的话，这次给印度人员造成这样巨大伤亡的可惋惜的事件本来是可以避免的。
    十四、印度主张和平并且完全反对使用战争方法解决国际争端，这是全世界都承认的。印度人民即便在争取独立的斗争中，也坚持采用和平的方法。对于中国政府和人民，印度的态度一直是友好的。这不仅与众所周知的印度的政策相协调，也是由于印度人民和政府认为，为了印度和中国的利益，为了亚洲和世界和平的利益，这两个亚洲大国必须保有友好的关系，虽然他们国内的政治结构可能不同。这些年来，印度政府曾一直为此目的而努力。因此，印度政府感到极为伤心的是，它的希望落了空，而且造成了一种危害存在于这两大国之间的和平友好关系的局面，这种和平友好关系是它本来希望将继续存在下去的。
    十五、印度政府感到特别遗憾的是，正当世界看来最后走向和平解决过去十二年中折磨着它的那些严重问题的时候，正当苏美两大国正在尽它们最大的努力来结束冷战的时候，印度的边境上竟再次发生暴力和侵略。亚洲各国热诚地主张和平，并且在谋求和平的工作中起了不小的作用。在世界历史的这个紧要关头，亚洲各国不仅应该主张和平，而且要用它们自己的态度和活动来促进和平。
    十六、依照它的坚定的政策，印度将继续努力用和平方法解决所有的争端，但是那里发生了侵略，印度人民将不可避免地不得不用一切可能的办法来进行抵抗。印度人民曾为印度的独立和完整进行了长期的争取自由的斗争，他们不能容许对其有任何的伤害或侵犯。因此，印度政府相信中国政府将从印度领土撤出它的军队，并寻求用和平的方法来解决细小的边界争端。
    十七、顺致最崇高的敬意。
