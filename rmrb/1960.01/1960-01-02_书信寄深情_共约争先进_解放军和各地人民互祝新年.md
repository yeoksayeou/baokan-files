Xinhua News Agency, 1st January: As the New Year approached, letters expressing heartfelt sentiments poured in. The Chinese People's Liberation Army received a large number of New Year greeting letters and congratulatory letters from all over the motherland. Soldiers also wrote letters to their loved ones to share good news, expressing their determination to advance victoriously and create even greater achievements in the new year.

Tens of millions of letters are filled with the deep friendship between the army and the people, expressing their determination and will in the era of the Great Leap Forward. The Dalian Port Authority stated in its New Year's greeting letter to the PLA: Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the throughput of our port has been rising in a straight line. In 1959, thanks to your strong support, we completed the annual throughput plan nine days ahead of schedule, creating a new record in history. Victory makes us elated, but we have never forgotten your enthusiastic help for a moment. Your soaring spirit and hard-working spirit in labor have set an example for us. The letter from all the staff and workers of the Kunming Iron and Steel Company praised the PLA, saying: When the construction project of our large-scale rolling mill entered the most intense stage, your large contingent arrived and completed the earthwork project of 210,000 cubic meters in a short period of time; when we urgently needed machinery and transportation, you lent us a large number of bulldozers, rippers, excavators and automobiles. We sincerely thank you, miss you, and will accelerate the construction of Kunming Iron and Steel with greater efforts to respond to your enthusiastic support. The New Year's greeting letter from the Yangfang Management District of the Nankou People's Commune in Beijing, after introducing the major achievements in production and construction since the establishment of the commune, said: All this is inseparable from the wise leadership of the Party and from your support. In the new year, we will do our best to strive for a greater harvest. Li Laicai, the deputy captain of the machinery team of the Hongqi People's Commune in Boai County, Henan Province, and a tractor driver without feet, said in a letter to his old chief and old comrades that he would always maintain the glorious tradition of revolutionary soldiers, resolutely fight wherever the Party directs, continue to be a pioneer in the Great Leap Forward, and strive for a good start in 1960, with red results every ten days, every month, every quarter, and red to the end!

In every letter the soldiers wrote to their loved ones, they joyfully introduced their progress over the past year. The former comrades-in-arms of the internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao said in a letter to Luo Shengjiao's parents: Under the guidance of the Party and inspired by the spirit of Comrade Luo Shengjiao, our company achieved "excellence" in military, political, and cultural studies in 1959. The Youth League branch was rated as an advanced branch and received a prize flag. Seventy-four soldiers were commended or rated as "Five-Good" soldiers. Soldiers Gu Daiyong, Huang Xuhai, etc., of a certain unit sent their "Five-Good" soldier or individual pacesetter honorary certificates as New Year gifts to the mother of martyr Huang Jiguang.

Deng Shixiang and Deng Shihong, two brothers who are soldiers of a certain PLA unit, wrote letters to the elders of their hometown, reporting on their life in the army and the achievements they have made in the year since they joined the army. The letter said: "Under the education and training of the Party, we have understood many revolutionary principles and learned the skills to defend the motherland. Our culture has also improved, and we are advancing from the level of the second year of junior high school to high school."

    新华社1日讯　新年佳节到，寄书表衷情，中国人民解放军收到大批来自祖国各地的贺年信、慰问信；战士们也纷纷写信向亲人报喜，表示要乘胜向前，在新的一年中创造更大的成绩。
    千万封书信中都洋溢着军民之间的深情厚谊，表达了他们在大跃进年代里的决心和意志。大连港务局给解放军的贺年信上说：1958年大跃进以来，我港的吞吐量在直线上升。1959年又因为有了你们的大力支援，提前九天完成了全年吞吐量计划，创造了有史以来的新纪录。胜利使我们欢欣鼓舞，但我们片刻也没有忘记你们的热情帮助。你们在劳动中的冲天干劲和吃苦耐劳的精神，为我们树立了榜样。昆明钢铁公司全体职工的信里盛赞解放军说：当我们的大型轧钢车间建设工程进入最紧张阶段的时候，你们的大队人马来了，短时间内突击完成了二十一万立方米的土石方工程任务；当我们迫切需要机械和运输力量的时候，你们又借给我们大批推土机、松土机、挖土机和汽车。我们衷心感谢你们，怀念你们，并将以更大的干劲加速昆钢建设，回答你们的热情支援。北京市南口人民公社阳坊管理区的贺年信，在介绍了公社成立以来生产建设中的重大成就以后说：这一切，都和党的英明领导分不开，也和你们的支援分不开。我们在新的一年中，一定会竭尽全力，争取更大的丰收。河南博爱县红旗人民公社机务队副队长、无脚拖拉机手李来财在写给老首长、老战友的信上表示，要永远保持革命军人的光荣传统，党指到哪里就坚决打到哪里，继续做大跃进的尖兵，争取1960年开门红，旬旬红，月月红，季季红，红到底！
    战士们写给亲人的每一封信里，都满怀喜悦地介绍了自己一年来的进步。国际主义战士罗盛教的生前战友，在给罗盛教的父母亲的信上说：我们的连队，在党的教导下，在罗盛教烈士的精神鼓舞下，1959年军事、政治、文化学习都是“优秀”。团支部被评为先进支部，获得了奖旗。七十四名战士立了功或被评为“五好”战士。某部士兵顾代勇、黄续海等，把自己的“五好”战士或单项标兵的荣誉证，作为贺年礼物寄给黄继光烈士的妈妈。（附图片）
    解放军某部战士邓世香和邓世鸿兄弟俩给家乡父老写信，汇报在部队中的生活情况和入伍一年来所取得的成绩。信中说：“在党的教育和培养下，我们懂得了很多革命道理，学会了保卫祖国的本领。我们的文化也提高了，正由初中二年的水平向高中前进。”
