    Seeking a Way Out for Japanese Monopoly Capital
    Yoshida Advocates Economic Expansion into Southeast Asia
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 21st: Former Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida has submitted a report to the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, vigorously advocating economic expansion into Southeast Asia.
    Before submitting this report, Yoshida made a one-month "visit" to various parts of Southeast Asia and Taiwan at the end of last year. He incited anti-communism and anti-China sentiment everywhere and explored the possibility of Japan implementing so-called "economic cooperation" with the local areas.
    In his report to the Minister of International Trade and Industry and the Minister of Finance, Yoshida Shigeru demanded that the government establish a committee directly under the Prime Minister to promote the "Southeast Asia Development Plan" and send a special representative with the rank of special ambassador to reside in Singapore to "coordinate" Japan's economic expansion activities in the Southeast Asian region.
    Yoshida also requested that the Kishi Nobusuke government seek effective ways to use the already allocated 5 billion yen "Southeast Asia Development Fund."
    Yoshida suggested that when Japan is active in Southeast Asia, it should not create the impression in Southeast Asia that Japan is trying to "develop Southeast Asia." He said, "In order to avoid this impression, Japan should fully cooperate with international cooperation organizations." In this regard, he cited institutions used by the United States to carry out economic expansion, such as the World Bank, the Development Loan Fund, and the Colombo Plan Organization.
    He also advocated that Japan sign treaties of commerce and navigation with Southeast Asian countries and resolve outstanding issues between Japan and these countries.
    It is reported that when Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama returns to Japan after going to the United States to sign the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, Yoshida Shigeru's report will also be submitted to him.

    为日本垄断资本谋出路
    吉田鼓吹向东南亚经济扩张
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本前首相吉田茂已经向岸信介内阁提交了一份报告，竭力鼓吹向东南亚实行经济扩张。
    吉田在提出这个报告以前，曾经在去年年底到东南亚各地和台湾作了为时一个月的“访问”。他到处煽动反共反华，并且试探日本与当地的实行所谓“经济合作”的可能性。
    吉田茂在他交给通商产业相和藏相的报告中，要求政府建立一个直属于首相的委员会来推行“东南亚开发计划”，并且派一个特命大使级的特别代表驻在新加坡，来“调配”日本在东南亚地区的经济扩张活动。
    吉田还要求岸信介政府寻求有效的方法，来使用已经拨出的五十亿日元的“东南亚开发基金”。
    吉田建议日本在东南亚活动时不要在东南亚造成这样的印象，即日本正在竭力要“开发东南亚”。他说，“为了避免这种印象，日本应该同国际合作组织充分地合作”。在这方面，他举出了美国用来进行经济扩张的机构如世界银行、开发贷款基金会以及科伦坡计划组织。
    他还主张日本同东南亚国家签订通商航海条约，并且解决日本同这些国家之间悬而未决的问题。
    据报道，在到美国去签订日美军事同盟条约的日本外务相藤山爱一郎回到日本时，吉田茂的这项报告也将提交给他。
