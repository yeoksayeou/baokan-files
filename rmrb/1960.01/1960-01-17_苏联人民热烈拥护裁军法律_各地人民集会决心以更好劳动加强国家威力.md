Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 16th: The decision by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to again implement a large-scale disarmament has been warmly endorsed by the broad masses of the Soviet people. Over the past two days, working people across the Soviet Union have held rallies and discussions to discuss Comrade Khrushchev's report and the Supreme Soviet's law regarding disarmament. In their speeches, they all expressed their determination to strengthen the nation through better labor, making it even more prosperous and powerful.

    Moscow textile worker Semyonkova said that in order to build communism, we need peace. N.S. Khrushchev's report strengthened our confidence in world peace. He expressed the will of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, whose main desire is to demand peace.

    Gaiding, foreman of the mechanical workshop at the Rostov Agricultural Machinery Plant, said that we, like all Soviet people, warmly support the law on reducing the Soviet armed forces. Our country is now unprecedentedly strong, and the nation's power is growing every year. We need peace, and we can defend peace. The Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union have once again set a good example for all mankind.

    Bezruchkov, head of the "Labor" state farm in the Saratov region and a former anti-aircraft gunner, said that we will continuously increase the power of our motherland with our own labor. Our farm will deliver one million poods of grain to the state this year, which will reach the level of the final year (1965) of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. We welcome demobilized soldiers to work on the farm.

    The Supreme Soviet's law on disarmament has been particularly heartily supported by the military. Soldiers and officers in a certain area of the Far Eastern Military District unanimously believe that the Soviet government's decision to disarm again is very correct and wise. Lieutenant Colonel Selisky said that the Soviet Union boldly reduced its troops. However, due to our achievements in science and technology, the power of the Soviet armed forces has not been weakened as a result. Our task is to always maintain a high degree of combat readiness and continuously improve combat technology.

    苏联人民热烈拥护裁军法律
    各地人民集会决心以更好劳动加强国家威力
    据新华社莫斯科16日电　苏联最高苏维埃会议通过的关于再次大量裁军的决定，受到了苏联广大人民热烈拥护。两天来，苏联各地的劳动人民纷纷举行集会和座谈，讨论赫鲁晓夫同志的报告和苏联最高苏维埃会议关于裁军的法律。他们在发言中都表示要以更好的劳动，来使国家变得更加富强。
    莫斯科纺织工人谢苗科娃说，为了建设共产主义，我们需要和平，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫的报告加强了我们对世界和平的信心，他表达了苏联各族人民的意志，他们主要的愿望就是要求和平。
    罗斯托夫农业机器制造厂机械车间工长盖丁说，我们和全体苏联人民一样，热烈支持关于裁减苏联武装部队的法律。我国现在已空前地强大，国家的威力每年都在增长。我们需要和平，我们也能保卫住和平。苏联共产党和政府再一次向全人类作出了良好的榜样。
    萨拉托夫州“劳动”国营农场负责人、过去的高射炮手别兹鲁奇科夫说，我们将不断用自己的劳动来增加祖国的威力。我们的农场要在今年交给国家一百万普特粮食，这将提前达到七年计划最后一年（1965年）的水平。我们欢迎复员军人到农场来劳动。
    苏联最高苏维埃关于裁军的法律特别受到了军人的衷心拥护。远东军区某地的士兵和军官一致认为，苏联政府关于再次裁军的决定是非常正确和英明的。中校谢利斯基说，苏联大胆地裁减军队。但是由于我们在科学技术方面的成就，苏联武装部队的威力并没有因此而削弱。我们的任务是要经常保持高度的战斗警惕性，不断使战斗技术臻于完善。
