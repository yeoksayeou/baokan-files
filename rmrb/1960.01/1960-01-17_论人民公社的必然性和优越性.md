On the Inevitability and Superiority of People's Communes
    Hu Xikui
    The People's Commune is the Inevitable Product of China's Economic and Political Development
    The Party's Beidaihe Conference resolution on the establishment of people's communes in rural areas in August 1958 analyzed the historical background of the emergence of people's communes and clearly pointed out that the people's communes were the inevitable trend of the development of the situation at that time. The resolution stated: "The main basis for the development of people's communes is the comprehensive and continuous leap forward in China's agricultural production and the increasingly high political consciousness of the 500 million peasants." This pointed out the material and ideological conditions for the emergence of people's communes in China. After the realization of agricultural cooperation, the Party put forward the general line of socialist construction and carried out the rectification movement and socialist education movement in rural areas. This movement made the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants unprecedentedly high, demanding a rapid change in the backwardness of the rural economy and getting rid of the situation of "poverty and blankness." Therefore, since the winter of 1957, a large-scale farmland water conservancy construction movement has been launched, peasants have been running industries, vigorously carrying out technological innovation, and developing diversified economies. The upsurge of rural production and construction developed forward with a magnificent posture. Thus, it is necessary to arrange labor forces more rationally on a larger scale, adjust and use the means of production, and utilize natural resources; it is necessary to expand the scope of operation, run industries serving agriculture, and adopt advanced technologies to gradually realize the modernization of agriculture; it is also necessary to develop cultural and educational undertakings as soon as possible and improve living conditions. All these could not be done by the original small-scale agricultural cooperatives. This shows that it has become an urgent need for the relations of production to further adapt to the development of productive forces. Under this situation, the new social organization of large-scale comprehensive (integration of government and commune and integration of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers) people's commune came into being.
    The birth of the people's commune is the Party's great creation of using the law that the relations of production must be suitable for the nature of the productive forces and leading the broad masses to carry out socialist construction. Establishing people's communes is a basic policy that the Party must adopt to accelerate socialist construction and prepare for a gradual transition to communism.
    The development of rural productive forces can be proved by the following materials.
    First, as mentioned earlier, the rural production and construction undertaking centered on water conservancy construction has been surging since the winter of 1957. Then, large-scale industries were established, large-scale tool reforms were carried out, new agricultural tools (including agricultural machinery) were promoted, advanced technologies were adopted, labor cooperation was expanded, and labor organization was improved. All this has greatly improved agricultural productivity. Judging only from the means of production, the number of tractors for agricultural use increased from 24,629 in 1957 (calculated in 15-horsepower standard units) to 45,330 in 1958, an increase of 84%. The number of double-wheeled double-shared plows supplied by the state increased from 95,000 in 1957 to 628,000, an increase of 561.1%. The power machinery increased from 265,000 horsepower in 1957 to 1,083,000 horsepower, an increase of 308.7%. In addition, when examining the level of productive forces, it is also necessary to link agricultural productive forces with the entire social productive forces, because the changes in agricultural relations of production depend not only on the level of agricultural productive forces, but also on the level of the entire social productive forces. Social production is a unified organic whole, composed of various production departments that are interconnected and interdependent. Agriculture is a very important production department, and it has close ties with almost all production departments. Agricultural relations of production must not only be suitable for the level of agricultural productive forces, but also suitable for the level of the entire social productive forces. In 1958, due to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, China's social productive forces greatly developed, and the quantity and quality of production tools, the number of laborers, and the level of production experience and technology were greatly improved. With such a huge development of social productive forces, there is a greater demand to change the already backward relations of production in agriculture. The emergence of people's communes is precisely the result of the development of agricultural productive forces and the entire social productive forces.
    Second, in addition to the means of production, social productive forces also include people who have certain production experience and labor skills and realize the production of material materials. People, that is, the working masses, are the decisive and main productive force. Under the leadership of the Party for a long time, the peasants in our country have carried out many revolutionary struggles, received revolutionary training, recognized the communist prospects, and continuously improved their political consciousness, which has stimulated their enthusiasm for production and their soaring energy. This is the greatest driving force for promoting the development of productive forces in rural areas in our country.
    The People's Commune is the inevitable product of the development of rural productive forces in our country. The emergence of the People's Commune, in turn, promotes the further improvement of productive forces. People who hold one-sided views on the issue of productive forces are bound to go to the dead end of "the theory of productive forces." They only see the decisive role of productive forces in the relations of production, but they do not see the promoting role of advanced relations of production in productive forces. In their view, the relations of production can only passively adapt to the development of productive forces. During the high tide of the cooperative movement in 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out that China's agricultural cooperation must be adapted to the steps of industrialization. Only after agriculture has been cooperated and a large-scale operation has been formed, it is possible to use modern agricultural machinery in large quantities. From this, an extremely important conclusion was drawn: "In agriculture, under the conditions in our country (in capitalist countries, it is to capitalistize agriculture), there must be cooperation first, and then large machines can be used." That is to say, agriculture must carry out technological transformation on the basis of social reform, and the continuous revolution of ownership and the technological revolution are combined. In recent years, the vigorous development of socialist construction in our country has proved that Comrade Mao Zedong's judgment is an objective truth that conforms to China's actual situation.
    It should also be pointed out that in socialist society, political power is not in the hands of the reactionary class that hinders social progress, but in the hands of the proletariat that promotes social progress. Under the leadership of the Communist Party guided by Marxism-Leninism, we can consciously and timely solve the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production, and continuously adapt the relations of production to the requirements of the development of productive forces.
    Therefore, after the establishment of the People's Commune, under the correct leadership of the Party, after rectification, it has become more consolidated and developed more healthily. After the establishment of the People's Commune, it not only did not cause damage to productive forces, but instead opened up an infinitely broad road for the further development of productive forces. In 1959, although our country suffered from particularly large natural disasters, with a disaster area of more than 600 million mu, the output of grain and cotton still increased compared with 1958, the year of the great leap forward. It is precisely because the establishment of the People's Commune, a new and higher relations of production, has promoted the rapid development of agricultural productive forces and improved the ability of peasants to fight against natural disasters, that 1959 was able to obtain a bumper harvest.
    Some people think that the People's Commune is moving too fast and "no pilot project has been carried out." This is fundamentally inconsistent with the facts. Before the high tide of the People's Commune movement, the broad masses of people had an urgent demand to establish communes. According to this demand, the Party carried out a series of pilot projects. For example, Suiping and Xinxiang in Henan Province, and Anguo and Xushui in Hebei Province all carried out pilot communes. It must also be pointed out that the People's Commune movement did proceed very quickly, much faster than the process of transforming the private ownership of individual peasants into the socialist collective ownership. This is because the People's Commune movement was prepared on the basis of a longer-term cooperative movement. At the same time, the development from the collective ownership of cooperatives to the collective ownership of communes is naturally much easier than the transformation of the private ownership of individual peasants into the collective ownership of cooperatives. In addition, when discussing the speed of the communization movement, it must also be linked to the situation in 1958, that is, under the encouragement of the Party's general line, a lively and vigorous situation of the national great leap forward appeared, which is also an important factor in the rapid development of the commune movement.
    Here, it is necessary to focus on the issue of the Party's leadership. The leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong over the People's Commune movement, like the leadership of the Chinese revolution, demonstrated unparalleled brilliance and foresight. This is the leadership of Marxism-Leninism, and this Marxist-Leninist leadership is prominently manifested in adhering to and applying the methods of continuous revolution and the mass line.
    From the perspective of the mass line, the People's Commune movement is a great mass movement. The essence of this movement is to better mobilize the enthusiasm of the 500 million peasants in our country to build socialism and to fight for the realization of the Party's general line. The implementer of the general line is the 600 million people. Now it can be clearly seen that the Great Leap Forward promoted the People's Commune movement, and the People's Commune movement provided a truly inexhaustible source of strength for the Great Leap Forward.
    From the perspective of continuous revolution, the People's Commune movement is another change in the relations of production. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Socialist relations of production have been established, and they are adapted to the development of productive forces; however, they are still very imperfect, and these imperfect aspects are contradictory to the development of productive forces." According to Comrade Mao Zedong's opinion, socialist relations of production cannot be fixed and unchanging. In order to adapt to the requirements of the continued development of productive forces, all aspects of the relations of production need to be adjusted at any time. Between productive forces and relations of production, contradictions constantly arise and are overcome, and overcome and arise again. This is a dialectical development process of getting rid of the old and bringing forth the new, and never ending. The emergence of the People's Commune movement in the great leap forward of agricultural production in our country in 1958 is a new proof of this truth.

    People's Communes are Very Good

    "People's communes are good, a road to happiness, workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, unified leadership, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, comprehensive development, the Party and Chairman Mao, their kindness is higher than the sky."

    This is a song of praise to the People's Commune by the peasants. Where does the superiority of the People's Commune lie?

    First, the establishment of the People's Commune has promoted the development of the socialist revolution in rural areas and eradicated the possibility of capitalist restoration.

    The People's Commune is the product of the great victory of the socialist revolution in rural areas, and once it is produced, it not only consolidates the results of the revolution, but also pushes the revolution to a new and higher stage.

    With the establishment of the People's Commune, the level of socialist collective ownership has been significantly improved, especially the emergence of the components of commune ownership, which represents the great hope and great future of the People's Commune. This shows that in solving the socialist revolution of the ownership of the means of production, the People's Commune has taken a big step forward than the advanced agricultural production cooperative. The agricultural cooperative focuses on solving the transition from the individual ownership of peasants to the socialist collective ownership; while the People's Commune focuses on solving the improvement of the socialist collective ownership itself and gradually transitioning to the socialist ownership by the whole people. In this way, the achievements of the socialist revolution on the economic front in rural areas have been further consolidated and expanded, eradicating the possibility of capitalist restoration.

    The establishment of the People's Commune has improved the awareness and organization of the people. Social existence determines social consciousness. Since the characteristics of the People's Commune are large and public, its existence and development will naturally promote the improvement of the socialist and communist consciousness of the members. Since the end of last year, the endless stream of new people and new things in rural areas has powerfully proved this point. In addition, the People's Commune has implemented "fourizations": that is, organizational militarization, action combatization, life collectivization, and management democratization. The organization and discipline of the people have been greatly strengthened. All this is very conducive to correctly handling contradictions among the people, strengthening the great unity of the people, and strengthening the dictatorship over the enemy, and carrying out the socialist revolution to the end.

    The reason why the People's Commune has become a powerful weapon to promote the in-depth development of the socialist revolution in rural areas and eradicate the possibility of capitalist restoration is that it has produced communist buds. The increasingly strong growth of this great bud means the destruction of the illusion of taking the capitalist road back, and means the prosperity of the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    Second, the establishment of the People's Commune has greatly developed social productive forces and accelerated socialist construction.

    The establishment of the People's Commune has expanded and improved collective ownership, and has taken on some of the components of ownership by the whole people. This change in the relations of production will inevitably further promote the development of productive forces. Due to the characteristics of the People's Commune of "large and public," it can more reasonably dispatch and use manpower, material resources, and financial resources than agricultural cooperatives, and more effectively carry out production collaboration. Therefore, it has created extremely favorable conditions for increasing agricultural production and supporting national industrial construction. The extraordinary leap forward in agricultural production in our country in 1958 and the maintenance of the continued leap forward under severe natural disasters in 1959 are the most powerful proof of the superiority of the People's Commune.

    In order to lead production and people's lives, before the communization movement, agricultural cooperatives that combined townships and communities had actually emerged, and some township-run enterprises were also included in this agricultural cooperative. By the stage of the communization movement, the integration of government and commune and the integration of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers was a very natural development trend. This is not a simple "adjustment of organizational structure," but a need for production development. The People's Commune is a social organization that integrates government and commune and integrates workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers. It is indeed conducive to the implementation of the Party's policy of "walking on two legs." The doubling of steel production in 1958 was due to the People's Commune and the millions of people going to the mountains. Overcoming the extraordinary natural disasters in 1959 and ensuring the continued great leap forward in agriculture was also due to the People's Commune. Isn't this a great achievement? Similarly, the development of commune industry, the development of red and expert schools, and the development of militia armed forces have all shown unprecedented new atmospheres.

    In addition, the commune economy, in addition to industry, includes agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. This is a comprehensive development of diversified economies, which is conducive to the realization of the agricultural twelve-year plan. The commune focuses on agriculture and also develops diversified operations.

    Third, while promoting production development, the People's Commune has also improved the material and cultural living standards of the broad masses.

    The People's Commune has adopted a distribution system that combines the wage system and the supply system. From the perspective of the wage system, it guarantees the implementation of the principle of distribution according to work. At the same time, the members have regular income, which is convenient for using money and is conducive to improving production and life. From the perspective of the supply part (generally only accounting for 20%-30%), it is currently a very good way to ensure that members who have lost their ability to work and members with a large number of dependents can solve their living difficulties. This is actually a kind of social insurance implemented in rural areas in our country. The implementation of the food supply system in rural areas is determined by the characteristics of agricultural production. The implementation of the distribution system that combines the wage system and the supply system in the People's Commune is a great creation of the socialist distribution method in our country, and it contains the buds of communism.

    The People's Commune runs canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, nursing homes, sewing departments, etc., which shows that the commune not only organizes production, but also organizes people's lives. Because the People's Commune has great strength, the public welfare undertakings it has run in a short period of time are much more than in the agricultural cooperative period. This is one of the reasons why the broad masses of members enthusiastically support the People's Commune.

    Fourth, the People's Commune is the best social organization form for realizing the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people and from socialism to communism.

    On the road of gradual transition from socialism to communism, solving the social organization form problem of the two transitions has a very important meaning. With the social organization form of the People's Commune, the transition can be carried out more naturally and smoothly. Among the working people in our country, there is a popular saying: "Communism is heaven, and the People's Commune is a bridge." This is a very appropriate description of the role of the commune in the two transitions.

    We know that the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people requires many conditions. The People's Commune plays a role in promoting the socialist revolution and accelerating socialist construction, and promotes the gradual maturity of the transition conditions, thereby ensuring the early realization of the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. With the prosperous development of the People's Commune, commune ownership gradually develops from partial to basic, and the components of ownership by the whole people in commune ownership also gradually expand and grow, which lays an extremely solid foundation for the transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people in rural areas in our country.

    The People's Commune, characterized by being large and public, is the integration of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers. It is a comprehensive combination of politics, economy, culture, and military. Its existence and development play a great role in creating conditions to eliminate the essential differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between manual and mental labor. At the same time, the integration of government and commune, the combination of labor and military, socialist large-scale cooperation, and the distribution system that combines the wage system and the supply system, which are currently implemented in the People's Commune, contain communist buds, and are also the best garden for cultivating these buds. Therefore, it has become the best social organization form for realizing the transition from socialism to communism in the future.

    A commune is a social organization form, and its nature is determined by the social mode of production. Some people think that the commune can only be communist, which only proves that their minds are rigid. Comrade Liu Shaoqi criticized this metaphysical mechanism and pointed out that the commune can accommodate different degrees of productive forces and different levels of relations of production that are adapted to them in socialist society and communist society. He wrote: "For our country, this social organization form is not only suitable for the current socialist collective ownership, but also suitable for the future socialist ownership by the whole people, and not only suitable for the current socialist system of distribution according to work, but also suitable for the future communist system of distribution according to need. There is reason to believe that the social organization form of the People's Commune will also be an appropriate grassroots social organization form after our country enters communist society." In China, a large country with more than 600 million people, creating the best social organization form for the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people and from socialism to communism is a great contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory and to the international communist movement.

    In short, the birth of the People's Commune not only promotes the great development of social productive forces, but also improves the material and cultural living standards of the people; it not only accelerates the socialist revolution and socialist construction, but also prepares conditions for the future transition to communism. This is a model of more, faster, better, and more economical in the cause of revolution and construction in our country. "People's communes are very good," this is our conclusion!

    论人民公社的必然性和优越性
    胡锡奎
    人民公社是我国经济和政治发展的必然产物
    1958年8月党的北戴河会议关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议，曾经分析了人民公社产生的历史背景，明确地指出了人民公社是当时形势发展的必然趋势。决议写道：“人民公社发展的主要基础是我国农业生产全面的不断的跃进和五亿农民愈来愈高的政治觉悟。”这就指出了我国人民公社产生的物质和思想条件。在农业合作化实现以后，党提出了社会主义建设的总路线，在农村进行了整风运动和社会主义教育运动，这个运动使广大农民的社会主义觉悟和生产热情空前高涨，要求迅速地改变农村经济的落后面貌，摆脱“一穷二白”的状况。因此，从1957年冬天起开展了大规模的农田水利建设运动，农民办工业，大搞技术革新，发展多种经济等等。农村的生产建设高潮以雄伟的姿态向前发展。这样，就需要在更大的范围内更合理地安排劳动力，调剂和使用生产资料，利用自然资源；需要扩大经营范围，举办为农业服务的工业，采用先进技术，以利于逐步实现农业的现代化；也需要尽快地发展文化教育事业，改善生活条件。所有这些，都不是原来规模狭小的农业社能够办到的。这说明生产关系进一步适应生产力的发展已成为迫切的需要。在这种形势下，大型的综合性的（政社合一和工农商学兵五位一体）人民公社这种新的社会组织就应运而生了。
    人民公社的诞生，是党利用生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的规律、领导广大群众进行社会主义建设的伟大创造。建立人民公社是党加速社会主义建设，并准备逐步过渡到共产主义所必须采取的基本方针。
    农村生产力的发展，可从以下材料中得到证明。
    第一，如前所说，以兴修水利为中心的农村生产建设事业从1957年冬就汹涌澎湃地展开了，接着，大办工业，大搞工具改革，推广新式农具（包括农业机械），采用先进技术，扩大劳动协作，改善劳动组织等等。这一切使农业生产力有了很大的提高。仅从生产工具来看，农业用拖拉机就由1957年的二万四千六百二十九台（以十五马力标准台计算）增加到1958年的四万五千三百三十台，即增加了84％。国家供应的双轮双铧犁由1957年的九万五千部增加到六十二万八千部，即增加了561．1％。动力机械由1957年的二十六万五千马力，增加到一百零八万三千马力，即增加了308．7％。另外，在考察生产力水平时，还要把农业生产力和整个社会生产力联系起来，因为农业生产关系的变革，不仅取决于农业生产力的水平，还取决于整个社会生产力的水平。社会生产是一个统一的有机体，是由互相联系和相互依赖的各个生产部门构成的，农业是其中一个非常重要的生产部门，它几乎同所有生产部门都有密切联系。农业的生产关系不仅要适合农业生产力的水平，还要适合整个社会生产力的水平。1958年，由于工农业生产的大跃进，我国社会生产力有了很大的发展，生产工具的数量、质量，劳动者的人数、生产经验和技术水平都大大提高了。社会生产力有了这种巨大的发展，更要求改变农业已经落后了的生产关系，人民公社的产生正是农业生产力以及整个社会生产力发展的结果。
    第二，社会生产力除生产工具外，还有掌握一定生产经验和劳动技能并实现物质资料生产的人，人，即劳动群众，是起决定作用的、主要的生产力。我国农民长期在党的领导下，进行了多次革命斗争，受到革命的锻炼，认识到共产主义远景，政治觉悟不断提高，激发了生产热情，干劲冲天。这是促进我国农村生产力发展的最伟大的动力。
    人民公社是我国农村生产力发展的必然产物，人民公社的产生，又反过来推动生产力的进一步提高。在生产力问题上持片面观点的人，必然要走到“唯生产力论”的死胡同里去。他们只看到生产力对生产关系的决定作用，而没有看到先进的生产关系对生产力的促进作用。在他们看来，生产关系永远只能是消极地、被动地适应着生产力的发展。1955年合作化运动高潮的时候，毛泽东同志曾经指出，我国的农业合作化必须和工业化的步骤相适应，只有在农业已经合作化后，形成大规模经营的基础上，才有可能大量地使用现代农业机械。由此，得出了一个极其重要的结论：“在农业方面，在我国条件下（在资本主义国家内是使农业资本主义化），则必须先有合作化，然后才能使用大机器。”就是说，农业必须在社会改革的基础上进行技术改造，所有制的不断革命和技术革命是结合的。几年来，我国社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展，证明了毛泽东同志的论断是符合中国实际情况的客观真理。
    还应当指出：在社会主义社会，政权不是掌握在阻碍社会前进的反动阶级手里，而是掌握在推动社会前进的无产阶级手里。在以马克思列宁主义为指导的共产党的领导下，我们能够自觉地、及时地解决生产力和生产关系的矛盾，并使生产关系不断地适应生产力发展的要求。
    因此，人民公社成立以后，在党的正确领导下，经过整顿以后，更加巩固了，更加健康地向前发展了。人民公社成立后，不但没有引起生产力的破坏，相反却为生产力的进一步发展开辟了无限广阔的道路。1959年我国虽然遭受特大的自然灾害，受灾面积达到六亿多亩，但是粮食和棉花的产量仍然比特大跃进的1958年有所增长。正是由于建立人民公社这一新的更高的生产关系，推动了农业生产力的迅速发展，提高了农民同自然灾害作斗争的力量，才使1959年获得丰收。
    有人认为人民公社步子太快了，“没有搞试点”。这是根本不符合事实的。在人民公社运动高潮前，广大人民已有建立公社的迫切要求，党根据这种要求，进行了一系列的试点工作，例如，河南省的遂平、新乡，河北省的安国、徐水等地，都搞了试点性的公社。还必须指出，人民公社运动的确进行得很快，比个体农民的私有制改造为社会主义的集体所有制的过程快得多。这是因为人民公社运动是在较长期的合作化运动的基础上准备起来的。同时，由合作社的集体所有制发展到公社的集体所有制，自然要比由个体农民的私有制改造为合作社的集体所有制容易得多。此外，在讨论公社化运动的速度时，还必须和1958年的形势联系起来，即在党的总路线的鼓舞下出现了全民大跃进的生动蓬勃的局面，这也是公社运动迅速发展的一个重要因素。
    这里需要着重谈谈党的领导问题。党中央和毛泽东同志对人民公社运动的领导，和领导中国革命的斗争一样，表现了无比的英明和远见。这是马克思列宁主义的领导，这种马克思列宁主义的领导突出地表现在坚持和运用不断革命的方法和群众路线的方法。
    从群众路线来说，人民公社运动是一个伟大的群众运动。这个运动的实质，就是更好地调动我国五亿农民建设社会主义的积极性，为实现党的总路线而斗争。总路线的实现者，就是六亿人民。现在可以清楚地看到：大跃进促进了人民公社运动，而人民公社运动给大跃进提供了真正取之不尽的力量的源泉。
    从不断革命来说，人民公社运动是生产关系的又一次变革。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中说：“社会主义生产关系已经建立起来，它是和生产力的发展相适应的；但是，它又还很不完善，这些不完善的方面和生产力的发展又是相矛盾的。”按照毛泽东同志的意见，社会主义生产关系不能是固定不变的。为着适应生产力继续向前发展的要求，生产关系的各个方面随时需要进行调整。在生产力和生产关系之间，矛盾不断地产生而又克服，克服而又产生，这是一个除旧布新、永无止境的辩证发展的过程。在1958年我国农业生产的大跃进中出现人民公社运动，正是这个真理的一个新的证明。
          人民公社好得很
    “人民公社好，幸福路一条，工农商学兵，统一来领导，农林牧副渔，全面来发展，党和毛主席，恩情比天高。”
    这是农民对人民公社的歌颂。人民公社的优越性在哪里呢？
    第一，人民公社的建立，推进了农村社会主义革命向前发展，根绝了资本主义复辟的可能性。
    人民公社是农村社会主义革命取得伟大胜利的产物，而它一旦产生，不仅巩固了革命的成果，而且把革命推向新的、更高的阶段。
    随着人民公社的建立，社会主义集体所有制的水平有着显著的提高，特别是出现了代表着人民公社伟大希望和伟大前途的公社所有制的成分。这说明，在解决生产资料所有制的社会主义革命方面，人民公社比高级农业生产合作社前进了一大步。农业合作社所着重解决的，是农民个体所有制向社会主义集体所有制的过渡问题；而人民公社所着重解决的，是社会主义集体所有制本身的提高，并逐步向社会主义的全民所有制过渡的问题。这样，农村经济战线上的社会主义革命成果就得到了进一步的巩固与扩展，根绝了资本主义复辟的可能。
    人民公社的建立，提高了人民群众的觉悟性和组织性。社会存在决定社会意识。既然人民公社的特点是一大二公，它的存在和发展，自然要促进社员的社会主义和共产主义觉悟的提高。去年年底以来，农村层出不穷的新人新事，有力地证明了这一点。加以人民公社实行了“四化”：即组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化、管理民主化，人民群众的组织性、纪律性大大地加强。这一切，十分有利于正确处理人民内部矛盾，加强人民的大团结，并加强对敌人的专政，把社会主义革命进行到底。
    人民公社之所以成为推进农村社会主义革命深入发展和根绝资本主义复辟可能的有力武器，在于它产生了共产主义萌芽，这种伟大萌芽的日益茁壮，意味着走资本主义回头路的幻想的破灭，意味着社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的欣欣向荣。
    第二，人民公社的建立，大大发展了社会生产力和加速了社会主义建设。
    人民公社的建立，使集体所有制扩大了和提高了，并且带上了若干全民所有制的成分。这种生产关系的变革，必然要进一步推动生产力的发展。由于人民公社“一大二公”的特点，它比农业合作社能够更合理地调度和使用人力、物力、财力，更有效地进行生产协作。因此，它为增加农业生产，支援国家工业建设，创造了极有利的条件。1958年我国农业生产的特大跃进和1959年在严重的自然灾害下保持继续大跃进，就是人民公社优越性的最强有力的证明。
    为了领导生产和人民的生活，在公社化运动以前，实际上就已经产生了乡社合一的农业社，某些乡营的企业单位，也就包括在这种农业社中。到了公社化运动阶段，政社合一和工农商学兵五位一体就是一种很自然的发展趋势了。这不是简单的“调整组织机构”，而是生产发展的需要。人民公社是政社合一和工农商学兵五位一体的社会组织，它的确有利于党的“两条腿走路”的方针的贯彻。1958年钢产加番，就是由于有了人民公社，有了千百万人上山。1959年战胜特大的自然灾害，保证农业的继续大跃进，也是由于有了人民公社。这难道不是伟大的成绩吗？同样，公社工业的发展，红专学校的发展，民兵武装的发展，都出现前所未有的新气象。
    此外，公社经济除了工业以外，包括农林牧副渔，这是多种经济的全面发展，有利于实现农业十二年规划。公社既以农业为主，又发展多种经营。
    第三，人民公社在促进生产发展的同时，也提高了广大群众的物质文化生活水平。
    人民公社采取了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，从工资制来说，它保证了按劳分配原则的贯彻，同时社员有了经常收入，用钱方便，有利于提高生产和生活。从供给部分（一般只占20％—30％）来说，它在目前是保证丧失劳动能力的社员和瞻养人口较多的社员解决生活困难的很好的办法，这实际上是在我国农村实行的一种社会保险。农村中实行粮食供给制，是由农业生产的特点所决定的，人民公社实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，是我国社会主义分配方式的伟大创举，它含有共产主义的萌芽。
    人民公社举办食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、缝纫部等等，说明公社不仅组织生产，而且组织人民的生活。由于人民公社力量大，在短期内举办的公益事业比农业社时期多得多，这就是广大社员热烈拥护人民公社的原因之一。
    第四，人民公社是实现由集体所有制向全民所有制过渡、由社会主义向共产主义过渡的最好的社会组织形式。
    在社会主义逐步向共产主义过渡的道路上，解决两个过渡的社会组织形式问题，有着十分重大的意义。有了人民公社这种社会组织形式，就可以使过渡进行得更自然、更顺利。我国劳动人民中，流行着这样一句话：“共产主义是天堂，人民公社是桥梁”，这是对公社在两个过渡中的作用，作了十分恰当的说明。
    我们知道：由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，需要有多方面的条件，人民公社起着推进社会主义革命，加速社会主义建设的作用，促进着过渡条件的逐步成熟，从而也就保证了集体所有制向全民所有制过渡早日实现。随着人民公社的繁荣发展，公社所有制由部分的逐渐发展成为基本的，公社所有制中的全民所有制成分也随之逐渐地扩大和增长，这就为我国农村中的社会主义集体所有制向社会主义的全民所有制的过渡，奠定了极其稳固的基础。
    以一大二公为特点的人民公社，是工农商学兵五位一体，政治、经济、文化、军事全面结合，它的存在与发展，对创造条件以消灭工农之间、城乡之间、体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的本质差别，起着很大的作用。同时，目前人民公社所实行的政社合一、劳武结合、社会主义大协作、工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，包含着共产主义萌芽，同时又是培植这种萌芽的最好园地。因此，它成为将来实现由社会主义向共产主义过渡的最好的社会组织形式。
    公社是一种社会组织形式，它的性质是由社会生产方式决定的。有人认为公社只能是共产主义的，这不过证明他们的头脑僵化。刘少奇同志批判了这种形而上学的机械论，指出公社可以容纳社会主义社会和共产主义社会中的不同程度的生产力和与之相适应的不同水平的生产关系。他写道：“对我国说来，这种社会组织形式既适合于目前的社会主义集体所有制，也将适合于将来的社会主义全民所有制，既适合于目前的实行按劳分配的社会主义制度，也将适合于将来的按需分配的共产主义制度。有理由相信，人民公社这种社会组织形式，在我国进入共产主义社会之后，也将是一种适当的基层社会组织形式。”在中国这样一个有六亿多人口的大国里，创造了由集体所有制向全民所有制过渡，由社会主义向共产主义过渡的最好的社会组织形式，这对马克思列宁主义理论、对国际共产主义运动，都是伟大的贡献。
    总之，人民公社的诞生，既促进社会生产力的大大发展，又提高了人民的物质文化生活水平；既加速了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，又为将来向共产主义过渡准备条件。这是我国革命和建设事业中的多快好省的典范。“人民公社好得很”，这就是我们的结论！
