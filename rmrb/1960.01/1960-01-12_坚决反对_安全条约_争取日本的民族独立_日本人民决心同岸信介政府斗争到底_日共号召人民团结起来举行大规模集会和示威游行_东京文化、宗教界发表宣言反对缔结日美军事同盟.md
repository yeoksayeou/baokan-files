Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: Tokyo news: The Japanese Communist Party distributed leaflets calling on all JCP members, workers, and citizens in Tokyo to participate in large-scale rallies and demonstrations scheduled for the 14th and 16th in Tokyo, strongly protesting against Kishi Nobusuke's upcoming trip to the United States to sign a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The leaflets said that the voices of millions of Japanese people demanding that Kishi Nobusuke stop signing the new "Security Treaty" and stop visiting the United States have spread throughout the country. Rallies and demonstrations will be held across the country on the 14th. Prefectures such as Gunma, Osaka, Kyoto, and Hiroshima will send thousands of representatives to Tokyo to protest to Kishi Nobusuke and the U.S. government against the impending signing of the new "Security Treaty." If Kishi Nobusuke ignores the people's demands and acts willfully, an even larger national protest rally and demonstration will be organized on the 16th.

The leaflets emphasized that the Japanese people's protest movement is rising and will never allow the Kishi Nobusuke government to betray the Japanese nation.

The leaflets also put forward the following slogans: Oppose the Kishi Nobusuke delegation's visit to the United States! Demand no signing of the new "Security Treaty"! Strive to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"! For peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality, all democratic forces in Japan unite!

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: Tokyo news: The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty Criticism Association unanimously passed a declaration at a conference held in Tokyo on the 10th, demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government not sign the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Six hundred and fifty people from cultural and religious circles attended the conference, including writers, artists, scientists, journalists, etc.

The declaration stated that the Japan-U.S. military alliance would exacerbate tensions in Asia.

The declaration said that the so-called "prior consultation" approach proposed in the revised Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" may become a way for the United States to force Japan to accept its demands, and that through this approach, the chances of Japan being dragged into a nuclear war may increase.

The declaration said that with the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the increasing intensification of the "Police Duties Law," the formulation of the "Anti-Espionage Law," and the revision of the Constitution, the revival of Japanese militarism may be triggered. The declaration pointed out that the vast majority of Japanese people feel uneasy about this situation.

The declaration said that the Japanese people are determined to fight against the revision of the "Security Treaty" and for the future of Japan. They will spare no effort to defend democracy.

The conference also decided that cultural and religious figures participating in this conference will participate in the eleventh national unified action against the revision of the "Security Treaty" scheduled for January 14th to 16th.

Participants in the conference held a demonstration on the main streets of Tokyo's bustling districts.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: Tokyo news: Twenty thousand people in Gunma Prefecture held a rally and demonstration in Maebashi City on the 10th, resolutely demanding that Kishi Nobusuke stop visiting the United States and abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

According to the "Akahata" report, the conference participants from all over Gunma Prefecture included workers, farmers, women, citizens, and many small and medium-sized business owners. Almost all the workers in Maebashi City participated in this conference.

After the meeting, the attendees divided into two teams, one team took sixty buses and cars, and the other team held union flags and placards, holding demonstrations in front of the prefectural government and in Maebashi City.

The conference was convened by the Gunma Prefecture League for the Protection of Democracy. League Chairman Tsunoda, Japan Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma, and Japanese Communist Party Central Committee member Masao Iwama all spoke at the meeting. Asanuma called on all participants to carry out the struggle to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to the end in order to strive for Japan's complete independence. Iwama pointed out that this historically significant gathering is a manifestation of the Gunma Prefecture people's determination to oppose Kishi Nobusuke's visit to the United States. He said that as long as the Japanese people are united, they will definitely be able to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The resolutions and declarations unanimously passed by the conference demanded that Kishi Nobusuke stop visiting the United States, abolish the "Security Treaty," restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and expressed their determination to fight to the end to realize Japan's neutralization.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: Tokyo news: About six hundred residents of Niijima Island outside Tokyo Bay held a rally tonight in the rain to oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's "Defense Agency" building a missile launch site in their hometown. The declaration passed by the conference stated that the people of Niijima Island will use the power of unity to oppose the government's construction of a missile launch site. The conference also discussed ways to strengthen the struggle in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th: The North Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today entitled "The Criminal Conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan Reactionary Group to Threaten Peace in the Far East," strongly condemning the U.S. and the Kishi Nobusuke government's preparations to sign a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The commentary said that revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a blatant trampling on the national interests of the Japanese people and a blatant challenge to peace in Asia. The Korean people, along with conscientious people of the world, feel great unease and anger at the criminal conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists and the Japanese reactionary group.

The commentary said, "This new Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' is aimed at socialist countries and peace-loving people in the Asian region, including Korea. The U.S. imperialists want to quickly and completely turn Japan into its aggressive outpost and nuclear war base in the Far East by revising the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty,' and revive and rearm Japanese militarism to make it the shock force for realizing the U.S. imperialist aggression plan." The commentary pointed out, "Signing a new Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' is in fact equivalent to forming a new aggressive military alliance in Northeast Asia." "Japan faces the danger of becoming a new hotbed of war and aggression."

The commentary said, "The Asian people, who have suffered immense disasters and pain due to the Japanese imperialists' aggression, resolutely condemn the anti-Asian people's conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionary groups. The Korean people know very well through historical experience what it will bring to them if the Japanese territory geographically adjacent to Korea becomes a U.S. imperialist aggression base. The U.S. imperialists used Japanese territory as their aggression base during the three-year war against the Korean people." "The Korean people also know that the U.S. imperialist aggressors, who are still occupying the southern half of our motherland and hindering the reunification of the motherland, are also using bases in Japan." The commentary emphasized, "We cannot sit idly by while the U.S. imperialists force Japan to sign this aggressive treaty, which is in fact a military treaty."

The commentary said, "The Japanese people will never allow Japan to become a supply base for aggression against Asia in violation of the national interests of the Japanese people. The Korean people fully support the Japanese people's struggle for national independence and the security of their motherland, resolutely opposing U.S. imperialist occupation of Japan, opposing the revision and demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty.'"

    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本共产党散发传单，号召在东京的全体日共党员、工人和市民参加预定14日和16日在东京举行的大规模集会和示威游行，强烈抗议岸信介即将去美国签订新的日美“安全条约”。
    传单说，日本千百万人民要求岸信介停止签订新的“安全条约”和停止访问美国的呼声已经遍及全国。14日全国各地将举行集会和示威游行。群马、大阪、京都和广岛等各府县将派遣数千名代表到东京来向岸信介和美国政府抗议即将签订新的“安全条约”。如果岸信介忽视人民的这种要求，一意孤行，那么在16日将要组织更大规模的全国性抗议大会和示威游行。
    传单强调指出，日本人民的抗议运动日益高涨，决不允许岸信介政府背叛日本民族。
    传单并且提出了下列口号：反对岸信介代表团访问美国！要求不签订新的“安全条约”！争取废除日美“安全条约”！为争取和平、独立、民主和中立，日本全体民主力量团结起来！
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日美安全条约批判会10日在东京举行的大会一致通过一项宣言，要求岸信介政府不签订新的日美“安全条约”。六百五十名文化界人士和宗教界人士参加了大会，其中包括作家、艺术家、科学家、新闻工作者等。
    宣言说，日美军事联盟将会加剧亚洲的紧张局势。
    宣言说，经过修改的日美“安全条约”提出的所谓“事先协商”的做法，可能成为美国迫使日本接受它的要求的途径，而由于这种途径，日本被卷入核战争的机会可能就将增加。
    宣言说，随着日美“安全条约”的修改、“警职法”的变本加厉、“防谍法”的制订和宪法的修改，可能引起日本军国主义的复活。宣言指出，绝大多数日本人民对这种情况感到不安。
    宣言说，日本人民将决心为反对修改“安全条约”和为日本的前途而斗争。他们将不遗余力地保卫民主。
    大会还决定，参加这个大会的文化界人士和宗教界人士将参加预定在1月14日至16日举行的第十一次反对修改“安全条约”全国统一行动。
    参加大会的人在东京热闹地区的主要街道举行了示威游行。
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本群马县两万人10日在前桥市举行集会和示威游行，坚决要求岸信介停止访问美国，废除日美“安全条约”。
    据“赤旗报”报道，来自群马县各地的大会参加者包括工人、农民、妇女、市民和许多中小企业主。前桥市的工人几乎都参加了这次大会。
    会后，到会者分成两队，一队乘六十辆公共汽车和小汽车，另一队手拿工会会旗和标语牌，在县政府门前和前桥市内举行示威游行。

    大会一致通过的决议和宣言，要求岸信介停止访问美国，废除“安全条约”，恢复日本同中国的邦交，并且表示将为实现日本中立化而斗争到底。
    据新华社10日讯　东京消息：东京湾外的新岛居民约六百人今天晚上冒雨举行了奋起大会，反对岸信介政府的“防卫厅”在他们的家乡建立导弹发射场。大会通过的宣言说，新岛人民要用团结的力量反对政府建立导弹发射场。大会并且讨论了今后加强斗争的方法。
    据新华社平壤10日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表题为“美日反动集团威胁远东和平的犯罪阴谋”的评论，强烈谴责美国和岸信介政府准备签订新的日美“安全条约”。
    评论说，修改日美“安全条约”是粗暴地蹂躏日本人民的民族利益和对亚洲和平粗暴地挑战。朝鲜人民和世界有良心的人们一起对美帝国主义者和日本反动集团的犯罪阴谋感到巨大的不安和愤怒。
    评论说，“这一新的日美‘安全条约’的矛头针对着包括朝鲜在内的亚洲地区的社会主义国家和爱好和平的人民。美帝国主义者想通过修改日美‘安全条约’，使日本迅速完全变成它的侵略远东的前哨阵地和核战争基地，并复活和重新武装日本军国主义，使它充当实现美帝国主义侵略计划的突击队。”评论指出，“签订新的日美‘安全条约’事实上就等于在东北亚形成新的侵略性军事同盟。”“日本面临着变成战争和侵略的新温床的危险”。
    评论说，“因日本帝国主义者的侵略而遭受莫大灾难和痛苦的亚洲人民坚决谴责美日反动集团的反对亚洲人民的阴谋。朝鲜人民通过历史经验很了解，在地理上邻接朝鲜的日本领土变成美帝国主义的侵略基地会给自己带来什么。美帝国主义者在反对朝鲜人民的三年战争期间利用了日本领土作为它的侵略基地。”“朝鲜人民也知道，现在还强占着我们祖国南半部，阻挠祖国统一的美帝国主义侵略者也在利用日本的基地。”评论强调说，“我们不能坐视美帝国主义强使日本签订这一事实上是军事条约的这一侵略性条约。”
    评论说，“日本人民决不允许违背日本人民的民族利益而使日本变成侵略亚洲的兵站基地。朝鲜人民完全支持日本人民为民族独立和祖国的安全、坚决反对美帝国主义强占日本、反对修改和要求废除日美‘安全条约’而作的斗争。”
