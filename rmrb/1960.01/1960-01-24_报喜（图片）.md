    Announcing Good News
    Poem by Zuo Hai
    Collective Creation by Tianjin Chinese Painting Research Association
    Celebrating the early completion of targets, we hear the joyous sound of the approaching New Year.
    Molten iron and grain mountains compete in splendor, human and heavenly years share glory.
