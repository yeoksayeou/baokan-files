Technological Innovation, Increased Pesticide Production, Supporting Agriculture
    Dagu Chemical Plant Carries Out Comprehensive Utilization of Non-Toxic 666 Isomers
    Shenyang Pesticide Plant Increases Production of Wettable Powder 666 from 6 Tons to 9 Tons Per Shift
    (Our Newspaper) Tianjin Dagu Chemical Plant is actively implementing the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in construction, adopting a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to vigorously promote the comprehensive utilization of non-toxic 666 isomers.
    Insecticidal 666 powder originally contained 85% of alpha and beta isomers that had no insecticidal effect. Extracting these non-toxic isomers and subjecting them to chemical treatment can produce many other pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and chemical raw materials. Now, this plant has established a workshop for the comprehensive utilization of non-toxic 666 isomers, mass-producing products such as trichlorobenzene, hexachlorobenzene, sodium pentachlorophenate, and tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone.
    In the face of inadequate conditions, the workers of Dagu Chemical Plant initially erected temporary sheds and used simple methods to conduct experimental production of extracting non-toxic isomers. After continuously accumulating experience and improving technology, they gradually expanded production and have now built a relatively large-scale 666 comprehensive utilization workshop, adding modern and systematic equipment. The production method has also been changed from benzene dissolution to the more advanced methanol extraction method for mass purification. The number of products made from non-toxic isomers as raw materials has also increased from three or four to more than twenty. Now, this plant has formed a relatively complete system for the comprehensive utilization of non-toxic isomers.
    The products of comprehensive utilization of 666 non-toxic isomers currently mass-produced by this plant are all pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and industrial raw materials with high economic value, which are of great importance for supporting agricultural production and ensuring people's health. For example, "hexachlorobenzene" is a specific drug for preventing wheat smut. Soaking wheat seeds with it not only provides immunity but also increases the yield by 15%. "Sodium pentachlorophenate" is not only a good bactericide and mildew-proofing agent but also a disinfectant that can kill parasitic schistosomiasis bacteria, which has a great effect on eradicating schistosomiasis.
    The workers of the 666 non-toxic isomer comprehensive utilization workshop of Dagu Chemical Plant are tapping the potential of equipment, expanding purification capabilities, and actively trying to produce more new products. At the same time, they are striving to put more than 20 products such as pentachloronitrobenzene and zinc pentachlorophenate, which have already been successfully trial-produced, into production as soon as possible.
    (Our Newspaper) Shenyang Pesticide Plant actively produces pesticides to support agriculture in eliminating pests and diseases. Last year, this plant, without adding equipment or personnel, launched a mass movement to vigorously carry out technological revolution and technological innovation, so that the six pesticides produced last year, including wettable 666, 666 powder, 666 smoke agent, DDT emulsion, DDT powder, and copper sulfate, all completed the annual national plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. The total output increased by 80.5% compared with 1958. The quality of the products also exceeded national requirements.
    Over the past year, under the leadership of the Party organization, the workers of Shenyang Pesticide Plant launched a movement to put forward thousands of rationalization proposals, and launched a movement to break through the 2,000-ton mark for quarterly production of wettable 666, a technical performance competition, etc. Centering on the key to production, they made a big noise in technological innovation and realized a double leap in output and quality. In the past, this plant relied on manual operation to manufacture 666 powder and wettable powder, resulting in low production efficiency. Last spring, they found the idle old drum dryer, and veteran workers Xie Zhaolin and Guo Xizhen, after painstaking research, broke through the key to preventing white clay and paper pulp waste liquid from adhering to the drum of the dryer, making this major technological reform experiment successful. After using drum dryers instead of manual operation, the number of production workers was reduced from sixty or seventy to more than twenty, and the efficiency of drying clay was increased nineteen times per shift, and the efficiency of drying paper pulp waste liquid was increased by about one time. In the second half of last year, this plant also summarized and promoted the good quality and high efficiency technical operation experience of the Zhao Changyou team, and systematically applied the workers' creations to production. They adopted nine major technological reforms, which greatly reduced the rework rate of products, and increased the shift output of wettable 666 from six tons to nine tons. In order to supply more and better agricultural needs, technician Liao Bolian and veteran workers Xie Zhaolin, Wang Qingfeng, and He Wen, with the active support of the leadership, used paper pulp waste liquid discarded by the paper mill instead of vegetable oil to make DDT emulsion, opening up broad prospects for the mass production of DDT emulsion. Since last summer, this factory has been using this method to mass produce DDT emulsion. (Attached pictures)

### 革新技术　多产农药　支援农业  大沽化工厂开展666无毒体综合利用工作  沈阳农药厂可湿剂666由班产六吨提高到九吨

    大沽化工厂开展666无毒体综合利用工作
    沈阳农药厂可湿剂666由班产六吨提高到九吨
    本报讯　天津大沽化工厂积极贯彻党的多、快、好、省的建设方针，采用土洋结合的方法，大搞666无毒体综合利用。
    杀虫666粉，原来有85％是无杀虫作用的甲体和乙体。把这些不能杀虫的无毒体提炼出来，经过化学处理就可以生产出很多其他农药、医药和化工原料。现在，这个厂已建立了666无毒体综合利用车间；大量生产三氯苯、六氯苯、五氯酚钠、四氯对醌等产品。
    大沽化工厂的职工在条件不足的情况下，最初搭起了临时工棚，用简易的方法，作提取无毒体的试验生产。经过不断积累经验和改进技术以后，逐渐扩大生产，现在已建成了一个规模相当大的666综合利用车间，添设了近代化、系统化的设备。生产方法，也由苯溶解改为较先进的甲醇提取的办法，大量进行提纯。以无毒体为原料制成的产品也由三、四种增加到二十多种。现在，这个厂已形成一个比较完整的无毒体综合利用体系。
    这个厂目前大量生产的666无毒体综合利用的产品，都是具有很高经济价值的农药、医药和工业原料，对支援农业生产、保证人民身体健康有重要作用。比如“六氯苯”，是防治小麦黑穗病的特效药。小麦用它浸种，不但可以免疫，而且能够增加15％的产量。“五氯酚钠”不仅是一种良好的杀菌剂、防霉剂，而且是一种能够杀死寄生血吸虫病菌的消毒剂，对于根除血吸虫病有着很大的效果。
    大沽化工厂的666无毒体综合利用车间的职工，正在挖掘设备潜力，扩大提纯能力，积极试制更多新产品。同时，力争把已经试制成功的五氯硝基苯、五氯酚硫锌等二十多种产品尽快投入生产。
    本报讯　沈阳农药厂积极生产农药，支援农业消除病虫害。去年，这个厂不增加设备不添人，通过群众运动，大搞技术革命和技术革新，使去年生产的可湿性666、666粉剂、666烟雾剂、滴滴涕乳剂、滴滴涕粉剂、硫酸铜等六种农药，都提前超额完成了全年国家计划，总产量比1958年增长80．5％。产品质量也都超过了国家的要求。
    一年来，沈阳农药厂的职工在党组织的领导下，展开千条合理化运动，提出突破可湿性666季产二千吨大关运动、技术表演赛等，围绕生产关键，大闹技术革新，实现产量、质量双跃进。这个厂制造666粉剂和可湿剂，过去都是靠手工操作，生产效率低。去年春天，他们把闲下来的旧滚筒干燥机找出来，老工人谢兆林、郭喜振经过苦思研究，突破了白陶土、纸浆废液不跟干燥机滚筒粘合的关键，使这项重大技术改革试验成功。采用滚筒干燥机代替人工操作后，生产工人由六、七十人减到二十多人，每班干燥陶土的效率提高十九倍，干燥纸浆废液效率提高一倍左右。去年下半年，这个厂还总结推广了质量好、效率高的赵长有小组技术操作经验，并且把职工们创造的点滴经验，搭配成套，系统的运用到生产中去。他们采取了九项重大的技术改革，使产品返工率大大降低，可湿剂666由班产六吨提高到九吨。为了更多更好地供应农业需要，这个厂的技术员廖伯廉和老工人谢兆林、王庆丰、何文等，在领导积极支持下，用造纸厂扔掉的纸浆废液代替植物油制成滴滴涕乳剂，为大量制造滴滴涕乳剂开辟了广阔的前途。这个厂从去年夏天起，已采用这种方法大批生产滴滴涕乳剂。（附图片）
