    A revolutionary writer who claims to be a Marxist, especially a Party member writer, must possess knowledge of Marxism-Leninism. However, some comrades now lack the basic viewpoints of Marxism. For example, a basic viewpoint of Marxism is that existence determines consciousness, that the objective reality of class struggle and national struggle determines our thoughts and feelings. But some of our comrades have turned this problem upside down, saying that everything should start from "love." Even when it comes to love, in a class society, there is only class love. But these comrades pursue what they call supra-class love, abstract love, as well as abstract freedom, abstract truth, abstract humanity, and so on. This shows that these comrades have been deeply influenced by the bourgeoisie. This influence should be thoroughly liquidated, and Marxism-Leninism should be studied very humbly. Literary and art workers should study literary and artistic creation, that is correct, but Marxism-Leninism is a science that all revolutionaries should study, and literary and art workers cannot be an exception. Literary and art workers must study society, which means studying the various classes in society, studying their interrelationships and respective conditions, studying their appearances and their psychology. Only by clarifying these things can our literature and art have rich content and a correct direction.
    ——Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"
    Glorious Mission, Heroic Era
    Guan Shanyue
    I was originally an old intellectual who engaged in an artistic career in the old society for nearly twenty years. I never understood what art was for, and even mistakenly believed that "art for art's sake" was noble, and that "individual struggle" was enough to be proud of. National liberation has given me the opportunity to directly receive the Party's training and education, and I have begun to find the direction of my efforts from Chairman Mao's thought on literature and art. At the same time, through the land reform, the anti-rightist struggle, the rectification campaign and various democratic reforms, as well as the socialist political and ideological revolutionary movements, my ideological understanding has improved to a certain extent, and my class consciousness has been raised to a certain extent, thereby gloriously joining the Communist Party of China. However, in my work unit, some young students actually regard me as a model of first being "expert" and then "red." On the one hand, this is a problem with their ideological understanding; on the other hand, it makes me feel even more ashamed! During the rectification movement, some comrades pointed out that I joined the Party with the identity of a painter. Through in-depth self-examination, I gradually realized that in my ideology and in certain words and deeds, I was indeed not enough as a proletarian literary and art fighter. A Party member writer should first be a good Party member, and only then a writer. If a Party member thinks that he has knowledge, and uses it as capital for joining the Party to bargain with the Party, this is completely wrong. Wasn't the bourgeois ideology of "one-bookism" criticized during the anti-rightist period? Our literary and art workers should learn from historical experience and be vigilant. We must resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois ideology in ourselves!
    In creation, the principle of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism is of great significance to literary and artistic creation. As a proletarian artist, he must first pay attention to ideological training, have a proletarian worldview, proletarian moral qualities, and must have revolutionary foresight and revolutionary ideals. Otherwise, it is impossible to educate the people and transform the world through his works. Without revolutionary political enthusiasm, it is impossible to discover nascent fresh things, and it is impossible to praise our Great Leap Forward and the greatness of our proletariat and the Communist Party. He will also not be able to create good works that conform to the principle of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.
    Here, the old question of serving whom and how to serve is involved again. We must serve the workers, peasants and soldiers, and serve socialism. Our service objects have long become the masters of this era. They have turned themselves over politically and economically, and they must also completely turn themselves over culturally and become the cultural masters of this era. They are not only appreciators of literature and art, but have become or will become creators of literature and art. We have sufficient reasons to affirm that the thousands of poems, murals and other forms of works created by the broad masses in the Great Leap Forward are a huge achievement in literature and art in this heroic era. Some excellent works have already embodied the spirit of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. The worker-peasant masses have not only improved their level of appreciation, but have also directly participated in various literary and artistic creation activities. Therefore, for a professional writer, he should first humbly learn from the broad masses, and then better serve them. I am an art worker, and I think that the question of how art can better serve the workers, peasants and soldiers—the masters of culture—needs to be further and seriously studied by us who are engaged in art work. For ten years, everyone admits that the cause of art, like other causes, has undergone unprecedented development and created unprecedented brilliant achievements under the correct leadership of the Party. But we cannot be satisfied with this, we must seriously shoulder the glorious mission of this era. Chairman Mao has pointed out the correct path for literature and art for us, which is infinitely broad, our future is brilliant, we should proudly, confidently, and highly raise the banner of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art and forge ahead, and strive to launch a mass literary and artistic creation movement, and strive to climb the world's highest peak of literature and art.

    一个自命为马克思主义的革命作家，尤其是党员作家，必须有马克思列宁主义的知识。但是现在有些同志，却缺少马克思主义的基本观点。比如说，马克思主义的一个基本观点，就是存在决定意识，就是阶级斗争和民族斗争的客观现实决定我们的思想感情。但是我们有些同志却把这个问题弄颠倒了，说什么一切应该从“爱”出发。就说爱吧，在阶级社会里，也只有阶级的爱，但是这些同志却要追求什么超阶级的爱，抽象的爱，以及抽象的自由、抽象的真理、抽象的人性等等。这是表明这些同志是受了资产阶级的很深的影响。应该很彻底地清算这种影响，很虚心地学习马克思列宁主义。文艺工作者应该学习文艺创作，这是对的，但是马克思列宁主义是一切革命者都应该学习的科学，文艺工作者不能是例外。文艺工作者要学习社会，这就是说，要研究社会上的各个阶级，研究它们的相互关系和各自状况，研究它们的面貌和它们的心理。只有把这些弄清楚了，我们的文艺才能有丰富的内容和正确的方向。
    ——毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”
    光荣的使命，英雄的时代
    关山月
    我原是一个旧知识分子，在旧社会里从事艺术生涯将近二十年，从来不懂得艺术到底是为了什么，甚至错误地认为“为艺术而艺术”是清高，“个人奋斗”足以自傲。全国解放了，使我有机会直接在党的培养和教育下，开始从毛主席的文艺思想里找到了自己努力的方向。同时，通过了土改、反右、整风和各项民主改革以及社会主义政治和思想的革命运动，思想认识上有了一定的进步，阶级觉悟有了一定的提高，从而光荣地参加了中国共产党。然而，在我工作的部门，有些青年学生竟把我看作是先“专”后“红”的榜样。这一方面是他们的思想认识问题；另一方面，也使我更感内惭！在整风运动中，有同志指出我是带着画家身份参加党的。在深入检查中，我逐步认识到在我的思想意识上，某些言行上，确实表现了我作为一个无产阶级的文艺战士还是不够的。一个党员作家，应当首先是个好党员，其次才是个作家。如果一个党员认为自己有知识，作为入党的股本，可以向党讨价还价，这是完全错误的。在反右期间不是批判了“一本书主义”的资产阶级思想吗？我们文艺工作者应该从历史经验中吸取教训，提高警惕。我们必须坚决彻底清除自己身上的资产阶级思想！
    在创作上，革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的原则，对于文艺创作来说，是有重大意义的。作为一个无产阶级的艺术家，他首先必须重视思想锻炼，要具有无产阶级世界观，无产阶级的道德品质，必须有革命的预见，革命的理想。否则，就不可能通过他的作品去教育人民，改造世界。他没有革命的政治热情，就不可能发现萌芽状态的新鲜事物，就不可能歌颂我们的大跃进，歌颂我们无产阶级和共产党的伟大。他也就不可能创作出符合革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的原则的好作品。
    这里又牵涉到为谁服务和怎样服务的老问题。我们要为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务。我们的服务对象早已成为这个时代的主人，他们在政治上、经济上翻了身，在文化上也要彻底翻身，成为这个时代的文化的主人。他们不仅是一个文艺的欣赏者，而且已经成为或将成为一个文艺的创造者。我们有足够的理由肯定广大群众在大跃进中所创作出来的千千万万的诗歌、壁画和别的形式的作品是这个英雄时代的文艺上的巨大成就。一些优秀的作品里已体现出来革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的精神。工农群众不仅提高了欣赏水平，还直接参与了各项文艺的创作活动。因此，对一个专业作家来说，他首先就应当虚心地向广大群众学习，然后才能更好地为他们服务。我是一个美术工作者，我以为，美术如何为工农兵——文化的主人服务得更好这个问题，有待于我们从事美术工作者进一步地严肃认真地加以研究。十年来，谁都承认美术事业和其他事业一样，在党的正确领导下有了空前的发展，创造出了前所未有的辉煌成就。但我们不能以此为满足，一定要严肃地担负起这个时代的光荣的使命。毛主席为我们指出了正确的文艺道路，它是无限广阔的，我们的前景是光辉灿烂的，我们应该自豪地、信心百倍地、高高地举起毛泽东的文艺思想旗帜勇往直前，为展开广大群众文艺创作运动而努力，为攀登世界的文艺最高峰而奋斗。
