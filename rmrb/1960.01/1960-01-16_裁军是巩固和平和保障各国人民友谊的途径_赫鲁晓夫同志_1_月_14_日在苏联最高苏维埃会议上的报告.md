Representatives!

In the report on the international situation and Soviet foreign policy delivered at the last session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the most important measures aimed at easing international tensions and strengthening the cause of peace were already outlined.

The proposal made by the Soviet government to the United Nations for complete and thorough disarmament has been warmly welcomed by the peoples of all countries. The idea of complete and thorough disarmament has been unanimously approved by the United Nations General Assembly.

The appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR to the parliaments of all countries has been supported by the parliaments and governments of socialist countries as well as by many deputies from various countries of all continents.

The Soviet government has consistently pursued a policy of peaceful coexistence, adhering to the Leninist principles of peaceful coexistence with countries of different social systems, and is gradually implementing the specific measures proposed in the suggestion for complete and thorough disarmament.

The Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party have decided to submit new specific proposals for the reduction of the Soviet armed forces to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR for consideration at this session.

Before discussing these proposals, allow me to touch upon some aspects of our domestic situation, international life, and Soviet foreign policy.

The Great Victory of Communist Construction in a Year

Representatives! The year 1959, which has just ended, will go down in history as the first year of the full-scale construction of a communist society in our country. The Soviet people are implementing the grandiose program of communist construction adopted by the Twenty-first Congress of the CPSU, achieving new brilliant successes in the development of the productive forces of the state, the creation of the material and technical base of communism, and the improvement of the material well-being and cultural level of the working people. The past year was a year of further significant strengthening of the Soviet social system and state system, further development of socialist democracy, and enhancement of the organizational and educational role of the Party. It was a year of new victories for our foreign policy aimed at maintaining and strengthening world peace, easing tensions in international relations, and further strengthening the world socialist system.

Soviet people, our foreign friends, and all those who can soberly assess events have every right to consider 1959 a year of great victories in the construction of communism. It has opened up a bright and broad prospect for solving fundamental international problems of great importance for the consolidation of peace. The proverb says: A good beginning is half the battle. Our seven-year plan has had a good start. To fulfill the seven-year plan ahead of schedule, a broad socialist competition has been launched throughout the country. The results of the labor of the entire people are abundant. In one year, industrial production increased by more than 11%, while the original plan provided for an increase of 7.7%. Products worth nearly 50 billion rubles were produced over the plan. To better illustrate the significance of this achievement, one can say that the entire industrial production of pre-revolutionary Russia, calculated at current prices, was less than this amount.

As always, in the development of the Soviet economy, the Leninist line of priority development of heavy industry has been consistently followed. In one year, the production of means of production increased by 12%, while the original plan provided for an increase of 8.1%. The production of black metals, non-ferrous metals, coal, oil, gas, electricity, chemicals, building materials, machinery, and equipment increased significantly. For example, according to the plan, steel production increased by 410 million tons compared to 1958, while the actual increase was 500 million tons. The coal extraction increased by 610 million tons, while the result was an increase of 1,040 million tons. The oil extraction increased by 1,450 million tons, while the actual increase in one year was 1,630 million tons. Electricity production increased by 28.6 billion kWh compared to last year, while the original plan provided for an increase of 22.4 billion kWh. Paper production increased by 91,000 tons compared to last year.

When drafting the seven-year plan, our starting point was: not to cause excessive tension in the execution of the plan, not to constrain the initiative of the national economic councils, enterprises, Party organizations, trade union organizations, and other social organizations and the broad masses of workers in the struggle to uncover reserves, better utilize production capacities, increase social labor productivity, and achieve over-fulfillment of the tasks of the seven-year plan. And these considerations proved to be completely correct. Life has shown that the seven-year plan will be fulfilled ahead of schedule, and its indicators will be significantly exceeded.

Light industry and food industry are developing successfully. The following products increased in production compared to 1958: fabrics by 346 million square meters, knitted underwear and outerwear by 44 million items, leather footwear by 33 million pairs, sugar by 576,000 tons. Overall, the production of consumer goods increased by 10.3% instead of the planned 6.6%.

The victories of agricultural workers bring joy and justified pride to the entire people. The recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU discussed the summary of the development of agriculture in the first year of the seven-year plan and proposed measures for the further development of the most important branches of agriculture. Despite the drought in many regions of the country, the total grain harvest in 1959 was less than in the unprecedentedly abundant year of 1958. Nevertheless, the state purchased 28.46 billion poods of grain, which satisfied the needs of the population and other needs of the state. The virgin and fallow lands played a particularly important role in the grain balance of the state. In 1959, 16.93 billion poods of grain were purchased in these regions, which is more than 10 billion poods more than before the cultivation of these lands. Significant achievements were made in cotton production.

Significant achievements were made in livestock farming. In 1959, compared to 1958, the procurement of livestock and poultry increased by 190 million tons, dairy products by 290 million tons, eggs by 1.1 billion, and wool by 38,000 tons. If compared to 1953, then the procurement of meat increased by 1.1 times, dairy products by almost 1.4 times, eggs by 1.2 times, and wool by 80%.

The fulfillment of the measures stipulated by the resolutions of the Twenty-first Congress of the CPSU and the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU will ensure a greater upsurge in all branches of agriculture and an abundance of agricultural products throughout the country.

The grandiose basic construction plan of the seven-year plan has begun to be implemented. Last year, more than a thousand new large state industrial enterprises were put into operation, and new production capacities were also put into operation through the reconstruction, expansion, and technical modernization of existing enterprises. The total basic investments of the state and collective organizations (excluding investments of collective farms) amounted to 275 billion rubles, which is 30 billion rubles more than in 1958.

To fulfill such a work plan, a large accumulation is required, and accumulation is primarily achieved by increasing labor productivity, reducing costs, and increasing the profits of enterprises. The tasks of the seven-year plan in this area are also being over-fulfilled. The plan for 1959 provided for an increase in labor productivity in industry by 5.4% and in construction by 8%; in fact, labor productivity in industry increased by 7.4% and in construction by 9%. The plan for reducing the cost of industrial products was over-fulfilled. Due to the reduction in product costs, the savings over the plan amounted to more than 10 billion rubles. Due to the increase in production and the reduction in product costs, the profits of Soviet industry increased by more than 20% compared to the previous year, significantly exceeding the planned figures. The increase in profits in the socialist economy is a significant event, because in our country, profits are not pocketed by monopolists but are used for the benefit of all the people, for the benefit of society.

One of the most important tasks of the seven-year plan is to ensure the constant improvement of the living standards of the working people. In a socialist country, the material well-being of the people primarily depends on the increase in national income. In 1959, national income increased by 8% compared to the previous year, i.e., by approximately 100 billion rubles.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government in 1959 implemented a series of major measures aimed at improving the material well-being of the people and improving their living conditions. By the end of last year, more than 13 million workers had their working day reduced to seven hours and six hours, and by the end of this year, all Soviet workers will complete the transition to a shorter working day. In capitalist countries, a reduction in the working day and working week leads to a reduction in workers' wages; unlike capitalist countries, we, when reducing the working day, not only do not reduce wages, but in many industries we significantly increased wages, especially the wages of low-paid workers.

As is known, the material and cultural security of the Soviet people is determined not only by direct wages and collective farm labor remuneration, but we also have another way of improving the well-being of the people, which is possible only in a socialist society, through public facilities serving the working people. The state's expenditures on social insurance, pensions, scholarships, free education, free medical care, and other public facilities increased from 215 billion rubles in 1958 to 230 billion rubles in 1959.

Last year, housing with a total area of more than 80 million square meters, i.e., more than 2.2 million well-equipped apartments, was built. In addition, collective farmers and rural intellectuals built approximately 850,000 houses. This means that the task of eliminating housing shortages set by the Communist Party and the Soviet government is being successfully solved.

On the basis of the growth of light industry, food industry, and agricultural products, the consumption of the people continues to increase. The amount of purchases by residents in state and cooperative trade increased by 8% in one year, and the sales of food, footwear, clothing, and cultural goods increased significantly.

The constant improvement of the material well-being of the working people, the improvement of health care and medical work, had a positive impact on the growth of the domestic population. The population of the USSR increased by 3.66 million people in one year, reaching more than 212 million people by the beginning of 1960.

The whole world recognizes the outstanding achievements of the USSR in national education and the development of science and culture. The population census conducted last year yielded some meaningful figures. There are 13.4 million people who have received higher and specialized secondary education or have studied in higher educational institutions; 453 million people are graduates of complete secondary schools and seven-year secondary schools. If in 1939 there were only 6 people with higher education and 77 people with secondary education per 1,000 residents, then in 1959 there were 18 people with higher education and 263 people with secondary education. It is gratifying that among those with higher education, women account for 49%, and among those with secondary education, 53%.

The number of people with higher and secondary education has significantly increased in the previously backward republics. For example, in the Uzbek SSR, the number of people with higher education per 1,000 people increased from 3 to 13 in twenty years, and the number of people with secondary education increased from 39 to 234; in the Kazakh SSR, the number of people with higher education increased from 5 to 12, and the number of people with secondary education increased from 60 to 239; in the Tajik SSR, the number of people with higher education increased from 2 to 10, and the number of people with secondary education increased from 27 to 214; in the Turkmen SSR, the number of people with higher education increased from 3 to 13, and the number of people with secondary education increased from 46 to 256; in the Azerbaijan SSR, the number of people with higher education increased from 7 to 21, and the number of people with secondary education increased from 73 to 261; in the Byelorussian SSR, the number of people with higher education per 1,000 people increased from 4 to 12, and the number of people with secondary education increased from 67 to 225. These figures depict a vivid picture of the development of culture, the growth of the national cadres of the Soviet Socialist Republics, and the victory of Lenin's national policy.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government pay great attention to the training of highly qualified cadres for the national economy, science, and culture. The number of students in Soviet higher educational institutions is almost three times the total number of students in higher educational institutions in Britain, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Italy. The USSR has long outstripped the USA in the training of engineers. In 1958, the USSR trained 94,000 engineers, while the USA had only 35,000. There are more than 300,000 Soviet scientists, which is 30 times the number in pre-revolutionary Russia.

Socialism has opened the way to culture and education for the masses, and this is one of the great advantages of socialism over capitalism. The extensive system of free national education from primary school to higher education is possible only under socialist conditions; this system is a good basis for the technical progress and scientific prosperity of our country, and the Soviet people have reason to be proud of these achievements.

1959 was a year in which Soviet scientists achieved great, universally recognized, new scientific feats, opening the way to the cosmos, to the exploration of the mysteries of the universe for the benefit of mankind.

Last year, the Soviet rockets sent to the moon became the first man-made planet in the solar system, the second Soviet rocket in the history of the cosmos for the first time reached the surface of the celestial body closest to us and delivered the emblem of our country to the moon, and the third Soviet rocket took photographs of the far side of the moon, which is not visible from the Earth. These achievements have opened a new era in world science and technology.

The world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker, the "Lenin," was put into operation last year. This ship has created broad possibilities for the year-round free navigation of our ships in the Arctic. In the eyes of world public opinion, the "Lenin" icebreaker, like our nuclear power plants and the use of radioactive elements in medicine, is a brilliant example of the peaceful use of atomic energy by the USSR.

The Soviet people have expended a great deal of labor to establish their leading industry—the foundation of the national economy. To achieve this goal, they sometimes sacrificed the most necessary things, they did not stop in the face of any difficulties, and they did not count the expenditure of forces. The talented Russian poet Bryusov once wrote these lines: "Work until you sweat, work without counting—all the happiness in the world is created by labor." The Soviet people work with this attitude. Now everyone can see the amazing achievements of the heroic labor of the Soviet people. Our country now has a solid technological base and outstanding scientists, specialists, and highly qualified workers to develop various modern industries on the basis of advanced technology.

The USSR was the first to begin and successfully develop the construction of nuclear power plants for peaceful purposes. Everyone knows our achievements in the manufacture of intercontinental passenger aircraft. Recently, Soviet pilots have set a series of new world records in speed and altitude. We have outstripped other countries by several years in the manufacture and mass production of various types of intercontinental ballistic missiles. Electronics and the manufacture of complex computers and control machines are of great importance in the current situation; we have significant achievements in this area, creating broad possibilities for the rapid further development of this most important sector of modern technology. Due to the implementation of the Party's task of accelerating technological renewal in the national economy, industrial and construction enterprises have widely adopted the flow method of production, the level of mechanization, especially the mechanization of heavy and labor-intensive work, has increased. Many production processes in industrial enterprises, construction industry, and transport are being automated on a large scale. We now have all the conditions to actually solve the task of transitioning from the automation of individual production processes to the complete automation of shop and enterprise technological processes, and in the future, all industrial sectors will completely transition to the automation of production and the automation of production processes.

If the automation of production in capitalist countries increases unemployment and brings suffering and disaster to the working people, then in the conditions of the socialist economy, automation opens up unlimited possibilities for increasing social labor productivity and increasing the wealth of the people in conditions of unprecedented improvement of the working conditions of workers and reduction of the working day.

Even the most stubborn enemies of socialism can no longer deny the rapid progress of the USSR in economic development and technological renewal. They can no longer deny the outstanding achievements of our country in economic, scientific, and technological development.

The indicators of the development of our industry and agriculture over the past few years indicate that the task set by the Party to catch up with and overtake the USA in terms of the production of products per capita is being successfully implemented.

Here is a comparison of the growth of industrial product output in the USSR and the USA from 1953 to 1959:

|                     | USSR       | USA         |
|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| All industrial products | Increased by 90% | Increased by 11% |
| Per capita          | Increased by 71% | Increased by 0.3% |
| Pig iron            | Increased by 57% | Decreased by 16% |
| Steel               | Increased by 57% | Decreased by 16% |
| Coal                | Increased by 58% | Decreased by 12% |
| Oil                 | Increased by 145% | Increased by 9% |
| Electricity         | Increased by 97% | Increased by 56% |
| Cement              | Increased by 143% | Increased by 24% |

From these materials, it can be seen that our country, like the entire period of Soviet power, has significantly outstripped the USA in the rate of industrial development.

The December Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU has already pointed out that the USSR has made great achievements in the development of agriculture. It is noteworthy that in 1959, our country, in terms of the production of animal fats per capita, outstripped the USA. The total milk production of the USSR has overtaken the USA for the second year in a row. As for meat, although we have significantly increased it in recent years, the production per capita still lags behind the USA, where it is 1.4 times more. The achievements in the development of livestock farming over the past year, the strengthening of the feed base, and the socialist guarantees given by agricultural workers have given people a firm confidence: in the production of meat, we will also catch up with the USA in the near future.

We achieved such brilliant successes in the first year of the seven-year plan, first of all, thanks to the heroic working class, collective farmers, and Soviet intelligentsia. The Soviet people, with their labor, are building new factories, houses, and schools, putting powerful technology into production, mining coal and oil, smelting steel, manufacturing high-quality machinery, cultivating abundant crops, increasing livestock production, opening new paths in science and technology. The grandiose prospects opened up by the resolutions of the Twenty-first Congress of the CPSU inspire our working people to create new labor feats.

In factories, mines, pits, construction sites, collective farms and state farms, economic regions, a broad socialist competition is underway to fulfill the tasks of the seven-year plan ahead of schedule. In the course of this competition, tens of thousands of initiators of advanced production methods and organizers of communist labor brigades have emerged.

The Party and the government, in accordance with the resolutions of the Twenty-first Congress of the CPSU, consistently implement measures to further develop socialist democracy, attracting the broadest masses of working people to manage the construction of the state, economy, and culture. The expansion of the powers of the union republics, local authorities, and social organizations, as well as the reorganization of the management of industry and construction, have yielded significant results. The political and labor activity of the masses is constantly growing, and their creative initiative is developing more and more.

The functions of our state are increasingly being performed by social organizations; the role of the public in solving the tasks of economic and cultural construction and strengthening socialist legality is increasing. This is especially evident from the fact that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Party recently adopted a resolution to abolish the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR and transfer all the issues handled by this ministry to the authorities of the union republics and local authorities. This is not only to streamline the apparatus but mainly to further develop socialist democracy, enhance the role of the public in the struggle against phenomena violating legality, and give more power to local authorities.

The creative initiative and great labor enthusiasm of the working class, collective farmers, and Soviet intelligentsia are a reliable guarantee that the grandiose tasks of the seven-year plan will be fulfilled ahead of schedule.

Now no one abroad doubts the high-speed development of the Soviet economy. The only question now is: how many times faster is our progress compared to the USA; how much time will it take for us to catch up with the USA. Now many famous economists, businessmen, and statesmen of the USA are actively discussing these issues.

Not long ago, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency of the USA, Allen Dulles, said: "The USSR, by 1965, in fulfilling its task of catching up with the USA, especially in industrial production, will achieve significant success." Allen Dulles, when talking about the state of socialist countries, said that one should "honestly admit that the economic plans of the USSR have achieved very exciting results, and they have achieved amazing success in the last ten years."

The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations of the USA at the end of last year published a report prepared by the Economic and Industrial Development Union. The report says: "By 1970, the USSR will probably be a country with a powerful, even more powerful, and in some respects more powerful industry than the USA."

These statements, which no one will suspect of exaggerating our achievements and possibilities, once again confirm the achievements of the rapid development of the Soviet economy. We are confident that in the peaceful economic competition between the two systems, the more progressive and vital socialist system will inevitably win.

The Twenty-first Congress of the CPSU marked the beginning of the period of full-scale construction of a communist society in our country. The seven-year plan for the development of the national economy approved by the Congress is the first stage of this historical period. Now it is possible to draft a more detailed long-term plan for the development of the national economy of the USSR for 15-20 years. This long-term plan will simultaneously be the plan for the completion of the great historical task set by Lenin—the electrification of the entire country, and it will be the main axis of the program for the full-scale construction of a communist society.

The Soviet people are fully confident that 1960—the second year of the seven-year plan—will achieve new brilliant victories in the construction of communism.

Some Issues of the Current International Situation

Representatives! We have more than once pointed out that the international situation has definitely improved in recent times. You all, of course, remember what the international situation was like a few years ago, for example, in 1952-1953. If we compare the situation of those years with today, we can only come to one conclusion: the clouds of war threats are beginning to dissipate, although not as quickly as we would like.

Of course, if one thinks that the development of recent events is a straight line, and this line is from some relatively high point of international tension to an increasingly lower point of international tension, that would be incorrect. If one could measure the degree of white heat of international tension like the temperature on a thermometer, then such a thermometer would show us a series of rises and falls, but the general trend is such that international tensions in relations are beginning to ease, and the instigators of the "cold war" are suffering defeats.

At the session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution, a proposal was made to hold a summit meeting of the East and West to ease international tensions. Now we can happily point out that the efforts of the USSR to ensure the convening of this meeting have already produced positive results.

Recently, we reached an agreement with the President of the USA, Eisenhower, the President of France, de Gaulle, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Macmillan, to hold a meeting of the heads of government on May 16 in Paris. It can also be seen that after this meeting, a series of summit meetings will be held.

It would be reckless to try to predict in advance the possible results of the upcoming meeting, because these results depend not only on us but also on our counterparts. However, it is very important to emphasize this point: that is, serious negotiations will be held with the leaders of the largest Western countries to achieve mutual understanding on the most mature international issues and to eliminate the roots of international tension. As for the USSR, we hope that this meeting will be beneficial and fruitful.

We are convinced that if one considers the interests of all parties wisely and everyone is willing to make concessions, then any controversial issue, no matter how acute and complex, can be resolved in a way that is beneficial and advantageous to all, and conducive to strengthening peace. There are many such issues that need to be resolved. First of all, these are: the issue of complete and thorough disarmament, the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, including the establishment of a free city of West Berlin, the issue of banning the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the issue of relations between the East and West. We propose to include these issues in the agenda of the upcoming summit meeting.

Due to the convening of such a meeting, the peoples of all countries have great hopes for the consolidation of peace and friendly cooperation between countries, which is very natural. Indeed, one can hear some statements, especially in some small countries, that people are worried: when the great powers reach an agreement, they will not take into account the interests of the small countries and will not heed the opinions of the countries that are not represented at the meeting. I declare here: such concerns are groundless. On the part of the USSR, it has never had and does not have the intention to conduct negotiations on issues directly affecting the interests of other countries behind their backs. We believe that any attempt to achieve unilateral benefits at the expense of the interests of other countries is fundamentally inconsistent with the purpose of the meeting to be held. The results of this meeting should be beneficial to universal peace, and thus beneficial to all great and small countries.

The meetings and frank and very beneficial conversations that I had with President Eisenhower at Camp David and with Prime Minister Macmillan during his visit to Moscow at the beginning of last year give reason to hope that the spirit of realism, openness, and cooperation will prevail in the upcoming summit talks. Recent experience fully confirms that direct contacts and meetings between state leaders are the most effective and hopeful methods for improving relations between countries and reaching agreements on unresolved international issues under the existing conditions.

In two months, I will visit France at the invitation of President de Gaulle. To get to know the great French people, our allies in the common struggle against Hitler's fascism, their lives and achievements will give us great pleasure. Our people have always had good feelings towards France, towards the French people who have made such a great contribution to the development of world culture, science, and technology. One can expect that my visit to France and the talks with President de Gaulle will have a good effect on improving Soviet-French relations and further normalizing the overall international situation. Our people know that General de Gaulle showed great courage when France was defeated and occupied by Hitler's army. At that time, many state leaders betrayed the interests of France and colluded with the occupiers. General de Gaulle fought for the liberation of France from the oppression of the occupiers and for the preservation of the national honor of France in those difficult years.

President Eisenhower will visit our country in June this year, and one can have many hopes for the meeting with him. We made efforts to establish trust between the USSR and the USA at Camp David, and the Soviet government hopes that this noble work will continue smoothly in Moscow.

After the closing of this session of the Supreme Soviet, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Voroshilov, will visit India at the invitation of the President of the Republic of India, and the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Kozlov, and the Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Furtseva, will also visit India at the invitation of the Indian government. The delegation also happily accepted the cordial invitation of the King and Government of Nepal to visit this country.

We believe that these visits will help to strengthen friendly relations between the Soviet and Indian (Nepalese) peoples and will help to strengthen world peace.

Everyone knows that I will soon visit Indonesia. I am visiting this country at the invitation of President and Prime Minister of the Republic of Indonesia, Sukarno.

We have great hopes for this visit, because our two countries have many common issues that unite us. These are the issues of further strengthening peace, the struggle against the rule of colonialists, and further consolidating the economic and political independence of countries that have already gained freedom and independence.

We received an invitation from Indian Prime Minister Nehru to visit India during my visit to Indonesia. I am pleased to accept this invitation because we believe that meetings with Mr. Nehru and other Indian state leaders will be beneficial to the cause of peace and will help to strengthen friendly relations between our two countries. The good relations between the Soviet and Indian peoples are developing and strengthening. My personal relations with Mr. Nehru are good. Visits, new meetings, and exchanges of views will help to strengthen world peace.

The Soviet government also received an invitation from King Zahir Shah of Afghanistan and the Government of Afghanistan to visit Afghanistan during this trip. We are pleased to accept this invitation. I hope to stop in Kabul to exchange views with our neighbor—King of Afghanistan and the Government, with whom we have already established friendly relations, and these relations are developing successfully.

We also plan to meet with the President of the Italian Republic, Gronchi, who will visit the USSR in February. We hope that the meeting and talks with the President of the Italian Republic will help to further improve the mutual relations of Italy and the USSR, will help to bring the peoples of our two countries closer, and will also help to strengthen the cause of peace.

Recently, there have been favorable trends in international life for easing international tensions. But at the same time, it cannot be overlooked that in the Western countries, especially in the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, there are still influential forces that do not like the warming of international relations and do not like direct contacts between the leaders of the East and West countries. The desire for super-profits drives certain imperialist groups to continue the arms race and maintain the state of "cold war." These groups are influential, and under certain conditions, they can harm the cause of easing international tensions.

Politicians who link their interests with the policy of the arms race are afraid of the easing of international tensions and do not believe that this easing will become a reality.

For example, we can cite the statements of the famous American billionaire, Governor of New York State, Rockefeller, former US President Truman, and former Secretary of State Acheson. This trio (and not only these three people) takes a position on international issues that is far from the position reflected in the Soviet-American communiqué adopted at Camp David. Their statements are samples of the standard "cold war" rhetoric. It seems that this is partly due to the fact that Truman is a former president, Acheson is his former Secretary of State, and these two "former" officials cannot give up the "position of strength" policy, "deterrence" policy, "rollback" policy, and "brinkmanship" policy that have already gone bankrupt. Other people seeking to gain influence in American political life also try to follow in the footsteps of Truman and Acheson. Who does not know that repeating the old tunes of the "cold war" policy will not bode well.

Those who are enthusiastic about the "cold war" try their voices here and there. They drag out the old tunes of the "cold war" in their speeches and scare people with the "communist threat." But this deceitful tune has long been tiresome and has aroused the anger of those who strive for peace.

The change in the mood of American society was particularly noticeable during Rockefeller's election campaign tour across the country. In his speeches to voters, despite the improvement in the international climate, he tried to exacerbate the "cold war" currents again and return to the worst years of the most tense relations between countries. What was the result? The result is that even those Americans who usually listen to billionaires like Rockefeller and "cold war" believers do not like such harsh rhetoric.

Rockefeller obviously intended to ride the "cold war" horse straight into the White House to taste the flavor of the presidential chair. But this horse began to stumble, and Rockefeller realized that this horse could not carry him, and now riding this horse would not get him to the White House. Therefore, he announced in advance that he decided not to run for president. But this step may only be a trick.

Of course, this does not mean giving up the "cold war" and being willing to lay down arms and strive for international cooperation. It is clear that the imperialists will try to regroup the forces of the "cold war" supporters. Lovers of peace should be vigilant and not relax their efforts to consolidate peace. Those who insist on maintaining international tensions and expanding armaments, those who seek to bring unimaginable dangers to mankind for personal happiness and career, should be more resolutely exposed.

It is hard to believe that there are people in the USA who do not understand the dire consequences of a new world war. If the aggressors start a war, then neither thousands of millions of dollars nor trillions of dollars can guarantee the aggressors from destruction.

The groups in the USA and other NATO countries that advocate continuing the "cold war" today are in a contradiction created by this "cold war" policy. On the one hand, these groups are fond of the arms race because the arms race brings them profits. On the other hand, they cannot but realize that the arms race is increasingly aggravating the danger of war, and the war will burn all their property, including the profits obtained from the arms race. Therefore, the policy of capitalist countries is full of a series of manifestations of contradictions, sometimes showing a tendency towards international cooperation, and sometimes showing a tendency towards exacerbating relations between countries.

Unfortunately, the position taken by the US government on the issue of stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons is an example of these contradictory tendencies.

Everyone knows that the three nuclear powers—the USSR, the USA, and Great Britain—have been negotiating in Geneva on the issue of stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons for quite a long time, more than a year. The importance of this task is clear to everyone. Naturally, it cannot be denied that, although the progress in the Geneva talks is slow, some positive results have been achieved, which help to conclude the treaty.

In these circumstances, the peoples of the world welcome the voluntary decision of each participating country not to conduct nuclear tests in the future, considering this a good and encouraging phenomenon. There have been no atomic and hydrogen weapon tests anywhere in the world for more than a year. This happy fact gives people hope that it will be possible to conclude the corresponding international treaty in the near future to consolidate the existing situation; it will be possible to end nuclear tests forever.

However, on December 29 last year, President Eisenhower of the USA issued a statement in which he said that after December 31, 1959, the USA considers itself no longer bound by the obligation to suspend nuclear weapons tests. Although the President's statement mentions that the USA has not previously announced that it will not begin testing, it is clear that the statement means that the USA can now resume nuclear explosions at any time.

The news of the decision of the US government caused regret and anxiety in the countries of the world.

If, under the current situation, a country resumes nuclear weapons testing, the consequences are not difficult to imagine. Other countries possessing such weapons will be forced to follow this path. This will trigger an endless race of nuclear weapons testing—testing nuclear weapons of any power without regard to conditions. The government that first resumes nuclear weapons testing will bear a great responsibility to the peoples of all countries.

If any of the three great powers decides to resume nuclear weapons testing, it will be very difficult to fulfill its obligations to the United Nations General Assembly. The recently concluded session of the United Nations General Assembly reflected the will of the peoples of all countries and unanimously called on the participants of the Geneva talks on stopping nuclear weapons testing to make greater efforts to conclude an agreement as soon as possible and not to resume nuclear weapons testing. The delegations of the USSR, the USA, and Great Britain all voted in favor of this call.

In this regard, I would like to emphasize once again that in order to ensure the most favorable conditions for the completion of the draft treaty on the cessation of testing in the shortest possible time, the Soviet government will continue to adhere to its obligation not to resume nuclear explosions in the USSR, provided that the Western countries do not begin testing atomic and hydrogen weapons.

President Eisenhower said in his statement that the prospects for concluding an agreement on the cessation of nuclear testing have recently seemed to be dimmed. It must be said frankly that we find it difficult to agree with this assessment. As I have already mentioned, the three-power conference has done a lot of work in drafting such an agreement. Not long ago, the USSR submitted new proposals to the Geneva conference for discussion, which address the three issues that had previously caused significant disagreements: the composition of the members of the supervisory commission, the composition of the supervisory personnel, and the procedure for the supervisory commission to adopt resolutions on budgetary and financial issues. The USSR's further proposals to meet the attitudes of the Western countries have created the possibility of progress in the Geneva conference in the future.

We are pleased to note that part of President Eisenhower's statement, which states that the USA will resume negotiations in the spirit of its unwavering commitment to concluding an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, is in line with our views.

As for the USSR, it will continue to seek ways to overcome the obstacles that have arisen in the course of the Geneva talks and will make every effort to conclude a treaty on the permanent cessation of all nuclear weapons testing as soon as possible. We believe that it is now possible to do this if all the participating countries are committed to reaching an agreement.

Official figures from the USA recently said that underground explosions can be conducted secretly without being detected by any instrument. Even if modern technology sometimes cannot absolutely guarantee the detection of all nuclear explosions; even if it is sometimes difficult to distinguish nuclear explosions underground from earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. However, if a corresponding agreement is concluded, then all parties naturally should faithfully fulfill this agreement. The peoples of the world can benefit greatly from this. All nuclear explosions underground, underwater, and in the air will stop. People will be able to be confident that the atmosphere will not be infected with radioactive dust. At the same time, the further development of science will make it possible to detect and record various nuclear explosions with absolute accuracy.

However, if even today it is not possible to guarantee the absolute accuracy and completeness of the recording of all explosions, then the conclusion of an agreement on the cessation of testing will impose a great responsibility on the signatories of this agreement. It is also clear that everyone must strictly adhere to this agreement. If one party violates the obligations it has assumed, then this violator will be shameful and will be condemned by the peoples of the world.

I have already said that there have been no nuclear explosions for more than a year, and this is a manifestation of the voluntary assumption of obligations without any international agreement. It should be considered that if such an agreement can be concluded, then it will more reliably bind the parties to strictly adhere to the agreement reached.

It is clear that using the imperfection of the methods of detecting nuclear explosions as an excuse is not a good way to cover up the resumption of underground nuclear explosions. If they want to resume nuclear weapons testing in the air, on the ground, underground, or underwater, then let them say it directly, and do not look for formal excuses to justify themselves.

We want to emphasize once again that the USSR firmly advocates: it is necessary to stop nuclear weapons testing in all forms in the air, on the ground, underground, and underwater. If only a resolution is adopted that prohibits testing in the atmosphere, this will break the hopes of the peoples of all countries for a complete cessation of testing. The peoples of all countries hope for complete disarmament, the dissolution of all armies, and a complete ban on nuclear weapons to ensure lasting and reliable peace throughout the world.

Western countries are increasingly aware that the international situation has changed, and the balance of power between socialist and capitalist countries has fundamentally changed. One can feel that it is precisely now, in these countries, especially in the USA, that the dead ideas about the nature and prospects of East-West relations, which have been formed over many years, are to some extent being broken. The speeches of many state leaders and political activists are about this topic. For example, some special committees of the US Senate have published extensive research materials on the future direction of the foreign policy of Western countries.

There are now many politicians in the West who have been convinced by life of the bankruptcy of the former "position of strength" policy, but they still do not want to admit that it is necessary to pursue a policy of true peace and sincere cooperation with the USSR and other socialist countries. It is clear that in the face of the brilliant victories and achievements of the USSR and the entire socialist camp, some groups in the West are in a state of panic and confusion, and this is the reason for their contradictory conclusions.

When we were in the USA, we deeply felt that the hopes of the most far-sighted state leaders, businessmen, and intellectuals of the USA—not to mention workers and peasants—are not to continue the arms race and nervous tension, but peace and tranquility. Since the USSR launched the man-made satellite and space rockets that demonstrate the power of modern technology, the American people have firmly realized that the fatal weakness of the USA in the military field is not inferior to that of any other country. I do not think anyone will doubt that I am trying to scare anyone with these words. No, this is the actual situation, and such a judgment is not made by us alone, but also by the leaders of the Western countries, including the USA, who think so. Whenever we talk about the necessity of peaceful coexistence and disarmament on any platform in the USA, our words are not only understood but also, I dare say, always receive a very good response and approval from the Americans.

Now, the broad masses of the people in the USA, Britain, France, Italy, and other countries are in such high spirits that even those who still cling to the "cold war" policy do not dare to openly oppose the ideas of disarmament and peaceful coexistence. Therefore, at this stage, they are adapting to the situation, reconfiguring their forces, and trying to disguise themselves. But their base has been destroyed, and in the face of the irresistible desire of the peoples of all countries for peace, their power is waning. Our task is to strike the supporters of the "cold war" more and more powerfully, so that they are put in a shameful position of isolation in world public opinion. Our most effective weapon in this noble cause is the peaceful policy of the Soviet government and the tireless efforts of the Soviet government to completely eliminate the "cold war."

In recent years, international life has been filled with various international events, and the course of these events has strengthened the international position of the USSR and all socialist countries. We have every reason to say that in the entire glorious history of the establishment of the Soviet state, the defense of our country has never been as reliably guaranteed as it is now, free from all unexpected and external threats. The influence of the USSR on international affairs and its authority as a bastion of peace have never been as great as they are now.

The balance of power on the international stage guarantees the superiority of the peace-loving countries. In the ranks of the united forces of countries that maintain the cause of peace, there are the USSR, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist countries. Many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are increasingly actively striving for lasting peace.

Striving for Complete and Thorough Disarmament

Representatives! Everyone knows that our Party, at the Twentieth and Twenty-first Congresses, concluded that under the present situation, war is no longer inevitable, and it is possible and necessary to exclude war forever from the life of human society. The bright path to saving mankind from the disaster of war is complete and thorough disarmament.

On September 18, 1959, on behalf of the Soviet government, I submitted the plan for complete and thorough disarmament to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion.

Our proposal is simple and clear to anyone. All those who strive to make the second world war that mankind has experienced the last world war and to ensure that the third world war will never break out support this proposal. To prevent new wars from breaking out, it is necessary to destroy the means of waging war, so that no country has the possibility to wage war against another. The Soviet government proposes precisely this. Our proposal provides for the dissolution of all armed forces and the destruction of all types of armaments.

The USSR itself is ready to abolish the military department, dissolve the General Staff, and abolish conscription, and proposes that other countries do the same. In short, the spirit of our proposal is to reduce the armed forces and armaments of all countries to almost zero, leaving only strictly limited armed forces, agreed upon by each country, equipped with light firearms, to maintain internal order and ensure the personal security of citizens.

We are pleased that at the United Nations General Assembly, all member countries unanimously adopted a resolution in support of the idea of complete and thorough disarmament. The ten-nation committee, which will soon begin discussions on disarmament, has been entrusted with discussing our proposal.

It should also be noted that our counterparts in the upcoming negotiations—the results of the discussion of the Soviet disarmament proposal mainly depend on them—have treated the Soviet proposal with attention, although in their active statements, reservations were made, especially regarding the establishment of supervision. These reservations surprised us somewhat, because our proposal provides for everything necessary to ensure reliable international supervision of the implementation of complete and thorough disarmament.

When drafting and discussing the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament in the government, we, of course, were fully aware of the attitude of our counterparts towards supervision, and therefore, as before, we have prepared proposals on supervision in great detail to avoid possible objections and not to provide an excuse for the reservations of Western countries. However, we still heard the old tune that the Soviet proposal does not provide for effective supervision of the implementation of disarmament measures.

If our Western counterparts are concerned with truly ensuring effective supervision of disarmament, we welcome this, because our position is the same. The USSR advocates strict international supervision of disarmament. The USSR advocates such an agreement on complete and thorough disarmament that will make one confident that no party can violate the obligation to implement disarmament. Our proposal provides for the establishment of effective international supervision of disarmament, of course, such supervision should correspond to certain stages of disarmament.

If Western countries make reservations about supervision in order to deliberately obstruct and eventually sabotage the agreement on complete and thorough disarmament, then this will, of course, dash the hopes for complete and thorough disarmament and cause deep concern among the peoples of all countries.

Some people in the West insist that disarmament poses a serious threat to the economy of capitalist countries. It is said that if the production of bombs, cannons, submarines, and other means of destruction is stopped, economic disruption will occur, and millions of people will lose their jobs and means of livelihood. However, such statements can only be made by those who see the development of the economy only as a means of subordinating the economy to the interests of war preparation.

Such statements are at least groundless. I have talked to many American businessmen, and they are not at all pessimistic about this issue. They believe that American industry is fully capable of handling the task of converting the entire economy to the production of peaceful products.

In fact, is there any reason to expect that the conversion of production capacity to the production of peaceful products will greatly reduce the taxes of the population, increase the capacity of the domestic market, and allocate more funds for education, health, and social welfare needs? And will not the possibilities of foreign trade, freed from artificial restrictions—such restrictions have nothing in common with economic interests—greatly increase? How many countries in the world need peaceful products, not weapons!

There is no doubt that after disarmament, the sales of peaceful products in the foreign trade market will increase indefinitely, and the development of world trade will open up the broadest prospects.

Disarmament is not only beneficial to one country or one group of countries; it will open the way for lasting peace and the economic development of all countries and peoples.

The USSR has not only spoken but also acted to prove its efforts to solve the problem of disarmament. Immediately after the end of the Second World War, our armed forces carried out large-scale demobilization. In the following years, the USSR completely withdrew its military bases from the territory of other countries.

The USSR has continued its efforts. To end the arms race and to take practical steps towards disarmament as soon as possible, we have further reduced our armed forces. Everyone knows that in the past four years, the USSR has unilaterally reduced the number of its armed forces by a total of 2,140,000 people. The Soviet army has withdrawn from the Romanian People's Republic, and the number of our troops stationed in the German Democratic Republic, the Polish People's Republic, and the Hungarian People's Republic has been significantly reduced in accordance with existing agreements.

I would like to report to the deputies of the Supreme Soviet on the changes in the number of our armed forces over the past thirty years.

After the end of the civil war, the Soviet government demobilized most of the army and reorganized the army. Therefore, by 1927, the Red Army and Navy had only 586,000 people. This was partly determined by the international situation at that time.

The aggression of Japanese imperialism in the Far East and the rise of the fascist government in Germany were the reasons for the increase in the number of our armed forces, and by 1937, the number of our armed forces reached 1,433,000 people.

Later, due to the outbreak of the Second World War, which created a direct threat of aggression by Hitler's Germany, the number of our armed forces increased again, and by 1941, it reached 4,207,000 people.

The treacherous attack by Hitler's Germany and the four-year bloody war forced us to increase the number of our armed forces to 11,365,000 people by May 1945.

Due to the immediate demobilization after the end of the war, by 1948, the number of the Soviet armed forces was reduced to 2,874,000 people. The Soviet Union wanted to reduce its armed forces at that time because it hoped that the Western countries would strengthen the relations formed between the anti-Hitler coalition countries on the basis of the idea of maintaining peace and friendship. However, our hopes were dashed. Due to the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, this aggressive bloc, and the nuclear blackmail, the USSR was forced to increase the number of troops to defend against possible provocations. The number of Soviet troops in 1955 was 5,763,000 people.

Later, during the period 1955-1958, as I have already mentioned, the armed forces were reduced by 2,140,000 people, and now the total number of the Soviet armed forces is 3,623,000 people.

This is the material on the situation of the Soviet armed forces over the past few decades. New Proposals for the Reduction of the Soviet Armed Forces

Representatives! Today, the Soviet government submits new proposals for the further reduction of the Soviet armed forces to the Supreme Soviet for consideration. As before, we believe that it is possible to unilaterally reduce the armed forces, regardless of the process of discussing disarmament issues in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee or other international organizations.

The Council of Ministers of the USSR submits for your consideration and approval the proposal to further reduce the Soviet armed forces by 1,200,000 people. If the Supreme Soviet adopts this proposal, then the number of our land and naval forces will be 2,423,000 people.

This will make the number of our armed forces lower than the number proposed by the USA, Great Britain, and France in 1956 when discussing disarmament issues. In that proposal, it was stipulated that the number of armed forces of the USSR and the USA would be 2,500,000 people each. We agreed to this proposal and have proposed it ourselves more than once, of course, our starting point is that this is only the first step in the reduction of armed forces. For example, in the proposal submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for consideration in the autumn of 1956, we mentioned these figures. More than three years have passed since then, but no agreement has been reached on this issue. Now a proposal is made to reduce the armed forces to a lower number, and we are doing this ourselves, without delay, without spending a lot of time and effort, and without worrying about endless arguments with our counterparts on the issue of disarmament.

We are confident that you, representatives, will fully discuss the proposal submitted to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR for consideration by the government, and will correctly understand the motives of the Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet government in doing so.

Every Soviet citizen, and especially the deputies of the Supreme Soviet—the representatives of the people—are primarily concerned about the security of the motherland, the defense of the fruits of the revolution, and the guarantee of the smooth construction of communism in our country. Therefore, the first question that arises from the proposal is: after the implementation of the proposed measures, will our country have sufficient defensive power? Why, when our enemies have not even abandoned the term "position of strength," do we not respond to strength with strength, but still reduce the army and navy, thereby reducing military expenditures? How can this be explained? Are we not indifferent to the security of our country?

We have repeatedly and comprehensively studied this issue, consulted with military personnel and the General Staff, and we can answer without hesitation: our defensive power is quite sufficient, and we have considered everything in reality.

What is the basis for confirming these realistic estimates and making such a major decision? What is the basis for the deputies to be confident that this decision will not harm the defensive power of our country when passing it?

The basis for our confidence in the correctness of the proposed measures is that the Soviet state is in a period of unprecedented prosperity in the entire national economy. Our conviction is based on the indestructible spiritual and political unity of the Soviet society. Soviet scientists, engineers, and workers ensure that our army can be equipped with various types of weapons unknown to people so far—atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, rocket weapons, and other modern weapons. The development of the Soviet economy and the achievements of scientific and technological thought have created conditions for the reduction of the armed forces. In addition, we have considered the strengthening and growth of the powerful socialist camp, which is a strong bastion of peace.

Due to the victory of Leninist ideas, the construction of socialism, and the further smooth development of communist construction, the USSR is now advancing in the economy, in improving the living standards of the working people, in the development of science, technology, and culture, and in all other aspects. On the basis of these achievements, the scientists, engineers, and workers of our country engaged in the defense industry have manufactured the most modern weapons that meet the latest achievements of science and technology. This makes it possible for us to reduce the armed forces without harming the defensive power.

The most stubborn enemies of socialism can no longer deny the rapid progress of the USSR in economic development and technological renewal. They can no longer deny the outstanding achievements of our country in economic, scientific, and technological development.

Title: Speech by Comrade N. S. Khrushchev at the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on the Question of Further Reduction of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 14th.

Representatives, comrades, allow me to express, on behalf of you all, our deepest gratitude to all the scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers who have dedicated their knowledge and labor to the benefit of our country and the strengthening of its might. The Party, the government, and the entire Soviet people warmly thank the scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers for their tremendous achievements in the creation of atomic and hydrogen weapons, rocket equipment, and other types of weapons, which have significantly enhanced our country's defensive capabilities, thereby enabling us to further reduce our armed forces.

The Soviet Union has stockpiled the necessary quantity of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Until an agreement is reached on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, we are forced to continue their production. Of course, this requires a significant expenditure of funds. However, we cannot yet completely abandon the production of nuclear weapons. The solution to this problem should be the result of an agreement among the countries that possess nuclear weapons.

Our country possesses powerful rocket technology. Under the conditions of modern military technology development, the air force and navy have lost much of their former significance. Such weapons are not to be reduced but replaced. Almost the entire air force is being replaced by rocket technology. We have significantly reduced the production of bombers and other outdated equipment, and it appears that this reduction will continue, perhaps even to the point of stopping production altogether. In the navy, submarines have great significance, while surface ships can no longer perform the roles they once did.

Our armed forces have to a large extent transitioned to rocket-nuclear weapons. These weapons are constantly being improved and will continue to be improved until they are banned.

Representatives, comrades, the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government can report to you that we already possess very powerful weapons, and those so-called weapons that are about to appear will be even more perfect and powerful. The weapons that are being created or are in the "briefcases" of our scientists and designers are simply incredible weapons.

Representatives, comrades, you will certainly agree that we can no longer treat the issue of the number of soldiers in the army as we did a few years ago. It is enough to say that since 1955, the number of our armed forces has been reduced by one-third, while their firepower, due to the adoption and development of various modern military technologies, has increased many times over.

Currently, the decisive factor in determining the defensive capabilities of a state is not how many soldiers are carrying guns or how many people are wearing military coats. If we set aside the general political and economic factors I have already mentioned, then the defensive capabilities of a state, in a decisive way, depend on firepower and on what kind of launchers this state possesses.

The reduction proposed this time will not weaken the firepower of our armed forces. After all, this is the main thing. In fact, the state maintains the army precisely to have the corresponding firepower to repel a potential enemy and prevent enemy aggression, or to retaliate appropriately if the enemy dares to invade our country.

Now, the Soviet army possesses combat tools and firepower that no other army has ever had. I will emphasize once again that we already have many nuclear weapons—atomic and hydrogen weapons—and the corresponding rockets to launch these weapons at the territory of a potential aggressor. If some madman starts an attack on us and other socialist countries, we can simply wipe out one or several countries that attack us from the face of the Earth.

Every sane person knows that atomic and hydrogen weapons pose the greatest threat to countries with dense populations. Of course, if a new world war breaks out, all countries will suffer. We will also suffer greatly, and many of our people will perish, but we will survive. Our territory is vast, and our population is not as concentrated in large industrial cities as in other countries. The worst off will be the West. If the aggressors start a new war, then this war will not only be their last war but also the end of capitalism, because the peoples of the countries know that capitalism is the source of war, and they will no longer tolerate this system that brings disaster and poverty to humanity.

If we consider all this, the Soviet people can feel confident and assured that the modernization of the Soviet army equipment is fully capable of ensuring that our country is not approached by enemies.

Of course, the concept of not allowing enemies to approach is conditional. Because we cannot forget that our enemies—while some countries do not hide their military and political goals and openly declare themselves to be our enemies—will not stand still. If these countries do not yet have as many rockets as we do, and their rockets are not as advanced as ours, they can still make up for their temporary lag, improve their rocket technology, and perhaps eventually catch up with us.

For example, the United States has set itself the task of catching up with the Soviet Union in rocket production within five years. Naturally, the United States will do everything in its power to get its rocket technology out of its current state in the United States and achieve a better position. However, if we assume that we will sit idly by during this time, it would be too naive. Even in the United States itself, there are those who say: "Will the Russians wait for us, will they play dice?"

Indeed, we will certainly do everything possible to use the time we have gained to develop rocket weapons and maintain our leading position in this area until an international agreement on disarmament is reached.

However, the question arises: if we do not exclude the possibility that some capitalist countries will compete with us in modern weapons, will they not resort to cunning and attack us first to take advantage of the suddenness of an attack with such terrible weapons as rockets and atomic weapons to gain an advantage in ensuring victory? No, modern combat tools will not give such an advantage to anyone who initiates an attack.

For the initiator of the attack, the attack does not require much wisdom but rather rashness. We naturally understand that some of our potential enemies have this tendency. Often, one can see that in one country or another, the supporters of the "policy of strength" show impatience and hot-headedness, although the "crown" of Hitler should have had a cooling effect on them. However, it seems that the consciousness of these people has become so confused that they have forgotten these serious historical lessons.

But suppose a country or a group of countries prepares for and carries out a sudden attack on a country that possesses nuclear and rocket weapons. Even if the attacking side manages to strike someone in a hurry, can it destroy all the nuclear weapons reserves and all the rocket technology facilities in the territory of the attacked country at once? Of course not. The country that suffers a sudden attack—naturally, here we are talking about a fairly large country—will always have the opportunity to retaliate against the aggressor.

We consider that there are foreign military bases around our country. Therefore, the configuration of our rocket technology ensures that we have double and triple means of retaliation. Our country is vast, and we have the ability to disperse rocket technology and hide it well. We have built such a system: if some of the weapons used for retaliation are damaged, there will always be backup weapons that can be used and can hit the target from the reserve positions. For sane people, for those who act responsibly towards the people and cherish the fate of the people, all this should have a sobering effect. Of course, you cannot trust madmen; such people have always existed and will probably not die out. Just do not forget that if, in the past, the rise to power of madmen led to bloody wars, then now this will be an unprecedented disaster.

A mother leaving home always worries that fuel, matches, or electrical appliances will not fall into the hands of ignorant children, lest they unknowingly cause great damage to the house and city. Similarly, the peoples of all countries should worry that people with crazy and evil intentions will not sneak into the government, parliaments, and other positions closely related to the safeguarding of peace. The peoples of all countries must remain highly vigilant and not allow madmen to use rocket-nuclear weapons against humanity until the problem of complete and thorough disarmament is solved, that is, until the problem of the destruction of all war weapons is solved.

Do not forget the lessons of the past.

The leaders of the Western countries have not yet abandoned the "policy of strength" and the "policy of the brink of war." Although the main spokesman for this policy has already died, his warlike slogans have not yet been filed away and abandoned. Especially enthusiastic is Chancellor Adenauer. However, Mr. Adenauer and those who like to repeat the old tune of continuing the "policy of strength" with him should realistically face the facts.

When the Western countries were economically superior and monopolized such powerful weapons as the atomic bomb, there was some logic in this policy, although it did not provide a reason for pursuing the "policy of strength" even then.

Now, the Soviet Union possesses atomic and hydrogen weapons, and our country has demonstrated its superiority in rocket technology to the world. The economy of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp countries is developing vigorously, the socialist camp is united, and the peoples of all countries are striving to safeguard peace. Under such conditions, the "policy of strength" has become completely meaningless.

In the current situation, where the balance of power has changed, what does it mean to bet on the "policy of strength"? This means that failure is predetermined, and it means following in Hitler's footsteps.

Everyone knows that it was Hitler who blatantly pursued the "policy of strength." When he came to power, he immediately set the task of implementing the policy of expansion and seizing the so-called "living space." He announced that he would wage war against the Soviet Union, advance to the Urals, and subjugate other countries.

Everyone still remembers the events that took place before the Second World War. Hitler shamelessly and blatantly told his comrades-in-arms: "We must abandon all tenderness and become resolute people. One day, I will order the start of the war, and I will not hesitate to throw millions of young people into death." Hitler considered other races and nations to be the fertilizer and slaves of the superior Aryan race, which should rule over all people.

To disguise these evil purposes, Hitler called his party the National Socialist Party (according to the original text, it can be translated as the "National Socialist Party"). The fascist leader hung the most popular word among the peoples of all countries, "socialism," on his lips to deceive more naive and inexperienced people to his side.

When Hitler pursued his policy of aggression, he often issued ultimatums. If the ultimatums were rejected, he would start military operations. He used this method to occupy many European countries. Intoxicated by easy victories, Hitler launched a bandit-like attack on the Soviet Union. Everyone knows what the outcome of this adventure was. The outcome was that when the Soviet army was already fighting in the streets of Berlin, this madman found the correct decision—to kill himself, like a scorpion in a circle of fire.

It should be noted that on the eve of the Second World War, the Soviet Union was the only socialist country surrounded by capitalism. At that time, we were not superior in economic and other resources. Now the situation is completely different. Anyone who thinks clearly and can consider and understand the events that have taken place since the war will not fail to see that the balance of power on the international stage has changed in favor of socialism.

Under the current conditions, pursuing the "policy of strength" against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries means taking a path fraught with mortal danger. Isn't this clear?

This adventurous policy is now most evident in West Germany. Everyone knows that one of the earliest reactionary measures Hitler took after seizing power was to ban the Communist Party and persecute workers' organizations. Adenauer also banned the activities of the German Communist Party and launched attacks on trade unions and other democratic organizations of the working people. In West Germany, one after another, shameful trials are being held against activists of the peace movement. What else can they do? Even from the perspective of the Federal Republic of Germany's constitution, some people are imprisoned simply because they stand up for peace based on their beliefs, which is a bullying and illegal act.

Recently, West Germany has shown a tendency to whitewash, or even almost restore the reputation of Hitler's bloody regime. Lord Russell of Liverpool pointed out this tendency very well. In a letter to the editor of "The Times," Russell reminded people of the fact that the German history textbooks published in 1958 for secondary schools are different from those published in 1949, and avoid mentioning such crimes of the Hitler regime as the Reichstag fire, the persecution of Jews, the atrocities of concentration camps, and other fascist evil deeds.

Russell cited specific materials from the German "World Newspaper" in his letter. For example, regarding the case of the Reichstag fire by Hitler's followers, the German history textbook published in 1949 still used two and a half pages to describe it, while the textbook published in 1958 did not mention it at all; regarding the persecution of Jews, the former used three pages, while the latter left only fourteen lines; regarding concentration camps, the former used five pages, while the latter did not mention them at all.

The recent outbreak of fascist anti-Semitic activities in various cities in West Germany is a clear sign of the rampant activities of reactionary forces. The various intrigues of the reactionary forces have long been known to the public. As early as several decades ago, during the period when the reactionaries were rampant in Tsarist Russia, there were not a few outbreaks of the atrocities of the Black Hundreds against Jews. Lenin, the Bolsheviks, and all progressives resolutely opposed this shameful phenomenon.

In Germany, Hitler intensified the incitement of anti-Semitism. He suppressed all freedoms and brutally trampled on democratic rights. All these were done to start his bloody business—to wage war.

The Soviet Union has advocated and continues to advocate friendship among the peoples of all countries, and friendship with the German people. We have established very good friendly relations with the German Democratic Republic, and we cherish this friendship. We are doing everything possible to establish good friendly relations with the Germans in West Germany as well. However, the activities of the West German government, especially its Chancellor Adenauer, to incite the "Cold War" make us very unhappy.

We have heard Adenauer's assurance that he is not a revanchist and that he will never allow any revanchists to serve in his government. The German people certainly do not want to have any common points with revanchists. However, on the one hand, Chancellor Adenauer makes such assurances, and on the other hand, the West German government is trying to modify the borders of European countries established after the Second World War and is extremely hostile to any statements advocating the elimination of the remnants of the Second World War, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and the establishment of lasting peace in Europe. How can these two situations be reconciled?

Secondly, judging from Adenauer's recent visit to West Berlin and his provocative remarks, he said: "If an atomic war breaks out, the Soviet Union will be wiped out." All this makes one think that Adenauer has not drawn conclusions from the lessons of German fascists but is walking on their old path. It should be believed that Adenauer will not be bewitched by the fate of Hitler.

It can be said with great certainty that if the arrogant fascists who are now allowed to gain power and command, organize the Federal Defense Forces, and command the armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in West Germany gain the upper hand, and if these scoundrels try to crawl out of their own national borders, then they will not only be unable to crawl to Moscow and Stalingrad as Hitler did when he launched an invasion, but they will be crushed on their own territory.

No statement can conceal the fact that there are very dangerous tendencies in the policy of the West German government; if the forces that love peace do not stop these tendencies, they may lead to very tragic consequences and lead to a Third World War.

The rearmament activities of West Germany are supported by France, Britain, and other countries that suffered from Hitler's invasion, which is surprising. How can these countries assist West Germany in rearming and use their own hands to help it build an army and equip it with modern weapons?

Some politicians in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's West German allies frankly say (of course, not in public, but behind the scenes): believe us and understand our meaning, if the Federal Republic of Germany does not join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, if it does not have an army and military spending, it will have a huge economic advantage and surpass the other Western countries, and it will become a more dangerous competitor in trade. And indeed, the economy of West Germany is stronger and more developed than that of the other member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, except for the United States. In this way, for these Western politicians, it is very dangerous to develop the economy of West Germany on a peaceful basis, while dragging the Federal Republic of Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and making it participate in the arms race seems to be a good thing! They do not object to burdening their West German opponents with arms and a large number of armed forces to weaken West Germany economically and create favorable conditions for competing with it in the world market.

Those who hold such strange views forget that they are giving weapons to German revanchists, but when using these weapons, they will not ask for permission from those who gave them the weapons. After all, the West German government has weapons, it will pursue its own goals, it wants to dominate Western Europe with its army and strong economy and manipulate its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. In fact, it is about to achieve this goal. West Germany already controls many important positions in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

French, British, Belgian, and other soldiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries now have to obey the orders of West German General Späth. However, the French know that this general was Hitler's confidant, the organizer of the Fifth Column of the French officer corps, and later the chief of staff of the Hitler troops that occupied France in 1940. The British know that he was one of the planners of the Hitler air raids on British territory. And it is this undefeated Hitlerite who is now the commander-in-chief of the land forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe.

At that time, the governments of the three Western countries tried to justify West Germany's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by saying that the Paris Agreements would protect European countries from the resurgent West Germany. The late U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said in Geneva in November 1955 at a meeting of foreign ministers: "The Federal Republic of Germany renounces the right to possess atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, and chemical weapons. Is anyone opposed to this? According to the Brussels Treaty, the military facilities and armaments of the Federal Republic are subject to the supervision and control of the Brussels Treaty Committee (which mainly represents the countries that suffered from German aggression). Is anyone opposed to this?"

Saying is one thing, but what is the actual situation? Someone said that allowing West Germany to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can control its military economy and armaments, but in fact, it has created a situation where West Germany has gained the ability to control its European allies and tries to exert pressure on the political policies of the United States. In fact, if Adenauer obtains atomic rocket weapons in the current military buildup, what remains of the initial restrictions on West Germany in the Paris Agreements? The drafters of the Brussels Treaty and the Paris Agreements can only console themselves with the dead clauses of these treaties and agreements that have been nullified by the revanchist policy of West German militarism.

Look at what Chancellor Adenauer called for in his article published on the eve of the New Year. According to custom, national leaders should issue peace blessings and blessings to the people on this day. Adenauer did not do this. He continues to advocate the "policy of strength" and loudly calls for "decisiveness and firmness" in implementing this policy. The recent easing of international tensions is to him only an "illusion." Chancellor Adenauer said that now "more than ever" it is necessary to increase the military power of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and West Germany.

Comrades, all this once again confirms that the task of concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanys, which the Soviet government has long and firmly advocated, has become so urgent. Such a treaty will completely eliminate the problems left over from the Second World War, ensure the peaceful and democratic development of the whole of Germany, and make the neighbors of West Germany believe that it will not take the path of new aggression.

The Soviet government considers the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany to be an urgent international issue of primary importance.

We will do everything possible to finally solve this problem. We sincerely hope to work together with our allies who fought against Hitler's Germany to seek a solution to the German problem. In this regard, we hope that this will also lead to the resolution of the Berlin problem on a mutually agreed basis. However, if our efforts to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys still fail, then the Soviet Union will, together with other countries that are also ready to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic and consider all the consequences that arise from this. The peaceful purposes of the Soviet proposal.

Representatives, comrades! Perhaps in some of our Soviet citizens and our friends—the peace-loving people of other countries—there will be such a question: will the further reduction of the Soviet army not encourage the military blocs that are hostile to us to become more rampant? Will the United States have more large-scale armed forces than the Soviet Union? West Germany now has nine divisions, and it can be expected that in the near future it will have twelve divisions. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization command in Europe alone has about fifty divisions. In addition, the armed forces of the European countries that are members of the North Atlantic Alliance and are under their own command have more than thirty divisions.

In this situation, will the reduction of the Soviet army endanger our country, and not only our country, but also the cause of peace? Will this encourage the forces of aggression, the enemies of communism, to salivate and wage war against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, thus plunging humanity into a new bloody slaughter? Will this harm the "deterrence" of the Soviet Union—using the popular Western term?

We have considered this question, and now we can tell the Supreme Soviet that the defensive capabilities of our motherland will not be weakened in the slightest. Under the current conditions, war is not fought in the same way as in the past, and it is very different from past wars. In the past, countries would deploy their armies as close to their own borders as possible to create a living barrier of soldiers and cannons in case of emergency. If a country wanted to invade another country's territory, it would have to attack the armies guarding the border. Wars often started this way. Initially, fierce battles took place on the borders of the warring countries, and armies were also concentrated there.

Now, if a war breaks out, the way of fighting will be different, because countries will have the means to launch weapons thousands and tens of thousands of kilometers away. The war will begin first in the interior of the warring countries, and not only in the first few days of the war but also in the first few minutes, all capitals, all major industrial or administrative centers, all strategic regions will not be able to escape being attacked. Therefore, if a war breaks out, it will be different from the start, and the development of the war will also be different.

Reducing the number of soldiers does not affect our ability to maintain the necessary defensive capabilities. We will still have all the means to defend the country, and the enemy will understand this, and if they do not understand, then we will warn them and declare directly: we are reducing the number of our armed forces, but we are not weakening their firepower, on the contrary, we will increase their firepower many times over in quality.

If the Western partners do not agree to follow our example, this will not only disappoint progressives but also disappoint the peoples of all countries. If the Western countries continue to be stubborn, this will only show that they are aggressive by nature and want to continue the arms race. Their execution of the arms race policy will further expose themselves in front of the masses of the people.

In the economic aspect, this policy will increase the burden on the budgets of capitalist countries and increase the tax burden.

Of course, before an agreement is reached on complete and thorough disarmament, we will still have to spend a certain amount of money for defense purposes, but this expenditure will be reduced in the case of a reduction in the number of armed forces. In addition, these funds will be used more effectively. Obviously, this situation is beneficial to our country, it will promote the growth of our national economic power, create more possibilities for improving the standard of living, further increasing material well-being, expanding housing construction, and promoting the shortening of the working day. The result will be that the large army of the military bloc that is hostile to us will unwittingly become our ally, making it easier for us to solve our main task—to surpass the most developed capitalist countries in science, in the production of machinery and labor tools, in the production of consumer goods, and in meeting human needs.

I want to answer the speculations that will inevitably arise abroad due to our proposal for disarmament, and our enemies will certainly want to spread such speculations regarding the Soviet Union's new and even shocking measures to reduce the armed forces.

In Western countries, it is often said that the Soviet Union's pursuit of disarmament is due to some difficulties we have encountered in implementing the seven-year plan for the development of the Soviet national economy. They even say that the Soviet Union's proposal for disarmament is only to free up forces to complete the seven-year plan. Of course, this is nothing but slander by those who do not wish the Soviet Union well. If someone in the West thinks that the economic situation of the Soviet Union cannot maintain the number of troops necessary to ensure our national defense capabilities, then for such a person, it would be even more disadvantageous.

I have already said that our economy is developing victoriously and unprecedentedly prosperous. And our future will be even better, because in the first year of the seven-year plan, we not only completed the plan but also overfulfilled many products. Therefore, we not only have no difficulties but also created very favorable conditions for the overfulfillment of the seven-year plan. It is clear that the argument that there are difficulties in completing the seven-year plan does not hold water.

Someone might try to say that our proposal to reduce the armed forces is purely for the sake of saving money and accumulating funds. You know, the problem of saving is always urgent and has great practical significance. The less expenditure, the less non-productive expenditure, the more funds will be available for the reproduction of means of production, for the development of the economy, and thus for increasing the production of products and more fully meeting the material and spiritual needs of the people.

The proposal to reduce the Soviet armed forces submitted to the Supreme Soviet for review will save approximately 160 to 170 billion rubles annually. Our people, our country will save a large sum of money. This will greatly promote the completion and overfulfillment of our national economic plans.

Eliminating non-productive expenditures and finding more ways to develop the economy is not only a task that stands before us but also a task that stands before any country. I will repeat, this is always an urgent problem that must be paid close attention to. However, we cannot limit the issue of national defense to the concept of value, nor can we limit it to any concept of saving. We are not people who sacrifice the essential for the trivial. When the lives of our people and the existence of our country may be threatened, we will not pursue rubles.

We are reducing the armed forces not because of economic and budgetary weakness, but because of strength and power. We are doing this out of the peaceful wishes of our people. Everyone should understand that if the situation requires an increase in the maintenance of the army, then our budget and our economy can provide far more than a hundred billion rubles to strengthen the security of our country. If our country faces the danger of direct attack, then we can not only maintain the current armed forces but also significantly increase them. Our budget and our economy can afford it, and we can also fully guarantee the investment for the implementation of the seven-year plan at the same time.

We propose to reduce our armed forces now. What is the principle we are following? We are following the lofty humanitarian ideals inherent in our progressive worldview. Indeed, the entire life of a socialist society is permeated with these ideals. We approach this issue not from the standpoint of the policy of strength but from the standpoint of reason.

We are reducing our armed forces because we do not want war, because we do not intend to invade anyone, do not want to threaten anyone, and have no aggressive intentions. Today, large armies and military bases far from one's own borders are used for aggression, not for defense. We are reducing the number of our armed forces, which also shows that our intentions are not aggressive but the most peaceful. After all, any country that intends to invade another country or several countries will not unilaterally reduce its own armed forces, because to invade, one needs not only to use one's firepower, including nuclear weapons and rocket technology, but also to increase the number of soldiers.

Representatives, comrades! We are now solving an issue of great historical significance—the issue of reducing the armed forces, that is, opening the way for further easing international tensions and strengthening world peace. This action will certainly resonate with the peoples of all countries. Even the most malicious advocates of the "Cold War" cannot say that this action is for the preparation of war.

Our people and the Party deeply respect and love our soldiers, sailors, sergeants, officers, army and navy generals and marshals, because they have always loyally served the interests of the Soviet people and the great Marxist-Leninist ideals. The brave sons and daughters of the Soviet people who shed blood and sacrificed their lives for the freedom and independence of the motherland in the Civil War and the Great Patriotic War are immortal. The Soviet people deeply thank those who bravely repelled the enemy's attacks and have always spared no effort to strengthen their own country's might and defend the peaceful labor of the Soviet people.

The Soviet people will welcome with great satisfaction the further reduction of the armed forces, and after the implementation of this measure, a large number of comrade soldiers will return to work in enterprises, construction sites, collective farms and state farms, scientific institutions, and schools.

Due to the government's proposal to reduce such a large number of Soviet armed forces (I believe this proposal will definitely receive the unanimous approval of the representatives), the Soviet institutions and party organizations will have a lot of work to do. We believe that the implementation of this measure will take about one to one and a half years, or two years. Because a large number of people will soon be discharged from military service. When doing this work, we must avoid unnecessary haste and not cause them difficulties. We must do a thorough job of preparation to ensure that all demobilized soldiers have jobs and are properly arranged. For ordinary soldiers and non-commissioned officers, this task is relatively easy to solve: their service time is not long, they have work skills, so they can return to their old jobs. In addition, these people are young, and they can easily learn a new trade.

A more important and complex issue is the arrangement of work for officers and political workers, that is, professional military cadres. We must pay special attention to these people. Our armed forces' military cadres are well-trained. They have devoted all their energy to studying military science and military art to better serve the motherland. Now they will be transferred to civilian work, to apply their knowledge to a new post, but still for the common cause—the victory of Lenin's ideas, the victory of communism.

We should care for and love these comrades, make them feel very happy in their new collective, in their new work environment. We should help them learn their profession well to ensure that they can receive their due wages. Everyone can choose a job they like, and we have very good conditions for this. In the new collective, they should be received with love and brotherhood, create a warm and caring environment for them, help them acquire knowledge, so that they can better apply their strength to the new post, although it is not a military post, but still for solving the same task—to further strengthen the power of the state, develop the economy and culture, and achieve the victory of communism.

Today, these cadres participate in production, and if the situation requires, they can return to the glorious ranks of the Soviet army to fulfill their duties to the motherland.

We should give the demobilized soldiers and officers time to adapt to their new lives. Perhaps it is necessary to establish training classes to enable them to acquire new skills. We will develop civil aviation, and the knowledge and experience of some pilots will be applied in their original posts. Some artillerymen and pilots will form new rocket troops, and many of them may be assigned to the corresponding departments of the national economy to engage in production.

It is not just a matter of casually placing the demobilized soldiers, but of properly settling them, ensuring that they are not only materially secure but also spiritually satisfied, feeling that they are working for the common cause and are active participants in the construction of communism. This is a complex and important task, and we must solve it responsibly.

Representatives, comrades! I would like to talk to you about some views on the future, which involve the further improvement of our armed forces, of course, this is under the condition that no progress has been made in solving the problem of complete and thorough disarmament. The government and the Central Committee of our Party are currently considering and studying the issue of transitioning to the territorial system in the future in the construction of the army.

Perhaps this will be a repetition of the method that Vladimir Ilyich Lenin adopted in the early years of the Soviet power, but under different conditions and with somewhat different meanings. We believe that the territorial system will be able to ensure the necessary number of cadres and residents who have received military training and can master modern weapons.

Looking to the future, one can imagine that we may have armies organized on a territorial basis. The personnel of each army will be able to master military technology without leaving production, and when necessary, the corresponding means of transportation—airplanes and other military technology—will be able to concentrate the army to the places needed within our country. I say this to let everyone, when passing the resolution on the reduction of our armed forces this time, also pay attention to the possible problems that may arise in the future if no agreement is reached on the issue of disarmament.

The Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government are convinced that every soldier, our officers, army and navy generals who have led the Soviet army in the glorious years of the Great Patriotic War and fought bravely, will understand and approve the Soviet government's proposal to further reduce the Soviet armed forces. We believe that the comrade soldiers who will be transferred to non-military work will also serve their people honorably in the peaceful labor posts, just as they have served in the glorious ranks of the Soviet armed forces in the past and present.

We express our deep gratitude to these comrades who have loyally and selflessly served in the Soviet armed forces.

Please allow me to sincerely wish comrades success in their new posts—serving the interests of the working class and the Soviet working people just as loyally and selflessly, to achieve the victory of communism.

The necessity of peaceful coexistence is determined by life itself.

Representatives, comrades! On the eve of important international negotiations, we have proposed to further reduce our armed forces, and this negotiation will discuss the Soviet Union's plan for complete and thorough disarmament within four years. Now everyone can see that we are not only proposing a plan for complete and thorough disarmament but are also unilaterally beginning to implement some major measures specified in this plan, that is, taking far-reaching steps to promote an agreement on the issue of disarmament. We do not just talk empty words but support our proposals with practical actions.

In international practice, there are often cases where someone proposes something while expecting that this proposal will definitely be rejected. This cunning method is incompatible with the Soviet Union and all socialist countries. The things specified in our plan for complete and thorough disarmament, we are ready to implement consistently and thoroughly from the day an appropriate agreement is reached. In addition, we are creating some conditions in advance that can greatly promote the reaching of this agreement and seem to anticipate that it can be implemented. Can the governments of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries say that they have taken such actions? Unfortunately, it cannot be said so at present.

We will further reduce our armed forces and sincerely hope that other countries will follow this path.

There may be such a question: in the past, in order to reach a unanimous decision with the Western countries to reduce the number of troops on a mutual basis, many schemes have been torn up, but why are we now voluntarily reducing our armed forces unilaterally? Is this a concession? Will this step be considered a retreat from our past demands?

Representatives, comrades, I should say that we have also noticed the possibility of such an interpretation of our decision. However, the government believes that the unilateral reduction of our armed forces is timely—that is the reason.

As I have already mentioned, the Soviet Union's plan for complete and thorough disarmament was submitted to the United Nations in September last year. The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to submit our proposal and other countries' proposals on disarmament to the Ten-Nation Committee for review.

Four months have passed since the Soviet Union submitted the proposal, but the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee has not yet started work, although its five member countries—the Soviet Union, the Polish People's Republic, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, and the People's Republic of Bulgaria—have repeatedly declared that they are ready to immediately implement the resolution of the Fourteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. At that time, an agreement was reached with the Western countries that the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee would start work in early this year. Later, this date was changed to February, of course, this was not proposed by us, and now the other side proposes to postpone the convening of the committee to March 15, to which we have to agree.

Please understand my meaning correctly. I do not want to say anything bad about the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee itself or about the important work it is about to undertake. The Soviet government very much hopes that the work of this committee will be as fruitful as possible and that it will be able to successfully undertake the major tasks it faces. However, in the post-war years, a lot of experience has been accumulated in disarmament negotiations, and if we do not speak out our concerns, we cannot be completely sincere. If this sad experience is also applied to the newly established mechanism for discussing the issue of disarmament—the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee—then the process of negotiations will be very long, perhaps, a lot of water will be drunk at the meeting before the negotiators can make progress on the road to a disarmament agreement. If the issue of stopping the arms race is discussed and solved at the speed that has been so far, for example, the issue of burying the dead, then the corpses will have rotted away, and there will be nothing to bury.

The Soviet Union's proposal for disarmament will not necessarily be met with direct opposition, because the current international situation is not like that. But everyone knows that in the arsenal of Western diplomats, there are still such tricks as establishing various committees and subcommittees, submitting various reports and analyses, endless debates on wording, and quarrels. It is not excluded that the opponents of disarmament may play all these tricks to obstruct the adoption of constructive resolutions. We hope that this kind of thing will not happen at all, so that the negotiations can be conducted sincerely and effectively.

However, it should be considered that the negotiations may still be unsatisfactory and regress, and then we will have to face a situation in negotiations: we must maintain the number of our troops at a level that, in fact, our national defense interests do not require. In negotiations, we will certainly propose the principle of equal reduction of armed forces and armaments as a condition. And if our negotiating partners delay reaching an agreement, we will not be able to solve this problem on the basis of the principle of equality. Therefore, before convincing our negotiating partners to agree to mutual reduction, in order to maintain the dignity of our country, our troops should maintain the current number.

Who will suffer a loss as a result? As a result, the Soviet Socialist state, our people, will suffer a loss because this will waste the people's money. And we will continue to maintain as many troops as today. By implementing the unilateral reduction of the Soviet armed forces, we are showing to the whole world, and with specific facts, our sincere intentions, our desire to live in peace and friendship with the peoples of all countries.

Of course, even after the reduction of the number of the Soviet armed forces, we will not relax our efforts to reach an agreement on complete and thorough disarmament with the Western countries. We hope that both we and others will be free from the threat of war, eliminate those accidental events that may drag humanity into war, because under the current conditions, a war that breaks out will necessarily become a world war.

We have sufficient reason to say that the steps taken by the Soviet Union unilaterally to ease international tensions will have a significant impact on the international situation now and in the future.

It should be believed that the peoples and public opinion of the Western countries will strengthen the pressure on the groups within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that want to expand the armed forces and armaments. Whenever the issue of increasing military appropriations arises in the parliaments of capitalist countries, parliamentarians who are close to the people can confidently talk about the example of the Soviet Union reducing its own armed forces. Any sane person in the West who has no aggressive intentions will comment: why, when the Soviet Union is greatly reducing its own armed forces, do we have to increase our armed forces? Of course, it is difficult to expect that those who have always insisted on the "Soviet military threat" will rot their tongues. However, it can be said with certainty that the audience of the "Cold War" guardians has greatly decreased.

When we implement the measures to reduce our armed forces, we should tell the Western countries: let us reach an agreement on disarmament, let us make every effort to prevent war, let us not compete in increasing armed forces and armaments, but compete in reducing armed forces and destroying means of warfare.

The Soviet Union and all socialist countries provide mutual assistance to raise the economy of some countries to a more developed level. At the same time, socialist countries have consistently implemented the principle of assisting economically underdeveloped countries. The working people of socialist countries sincerely hope that the peoples fighting for their freedom and independence will establish their own economies and firmly rely on self-reliance to develop the economy and improve material well-being without relying on the charity of rich capitalist countries.

The Soviet Union has helped other countries to the best of its ability in the past and present, and I do not need to list the countries we have helped and the enterprises we have participated in building there, because it is a very long list.

Reducing the armed forces, that is, reducing military expenditures, can create better conditions for the development of our country's economy and thus for expanding assistance to the so-called underdeveloped countries.

We have said in the past and now that if an agreement is reached on complete and thorough disarmament and a large amount of funds are freed up, then these funds can be used to greatly assist all economically underdeveloped countries.

All countries—regardless of their internal order and the social system that dominates them—peaceful coexistence is the basic issue today, the issue of issues in international life. Only peaceful coexistence strengthened by disarmament is the broad road to lasting peace and preventing humanity from the disaster of a destructive world war. Not only the broad masses of the people but also many government officials and politicians of capitalist countries are increasingly aware of the necessity of peaceful coexistence.

However, there are also those who are eager to distort the concept of peaceful coexistence. Among the most stubborn advocates of the "Cold War," some even try to scare people with peaceful coexistence, depicting it as a communist plot.

We have said more than once that peaceful coexistence is not the fancy of any individual but a reality that reflects the existence of two social systems in the world today—socialism and capitalism. These two social systems are competing in the economic field and are engaged in ideological struggle. This phenomenon itself is lawful and is a necessary stage in social development. The whole problem is only in what means to solve the problem of which system is superior—through peaceful competition or through war struggle.

The dispute between the two systems can and should be resolved by peaceful means, not by force. Ideological struggle, struggle for the hearts of the people, will continue under the conditions of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. However, we propose not to use force but to use the power of persuasion and good examples to resolve ideological disputes between countries. Our decision to further reduce the armed forces is to set an example that conforms to the beautiful ideals of humanity. We advocate that each social system demonstrates its superiority in the process of peaceful development, and let the people of each country choose which social system to support.

Peaceful coexistence—this means that countries with ideological opposition should live in peace with each other, exist and live side by side. The word "coexistence" comes from this. If there were only one ideology in the world and only one social system in all countries, then there would be no opposing systems, and there would be no such coexistence problem we are talking about. Then, it would be existence, not coexistence.

However, the current situation in the world is that there are two camps, and the social systems of these two camps are different. The policies of the countries of these two camps are based on completely different foundations. Therefore, under these circumstances, the problem of peaceful coexistence, that is, how to prevent the disaster of military conflict between two essentially hostile systems, between the two types of countries where these systems dominate, has extremely important significance. Efforts must be made to turn the inevitable struggle between the two systems into only an ideological struggle, into a peaceful competition,—or, to put it in terms that capitalists can understand more easily—competition. Therefore, each side will strive to demonstrate its superiority to people as much as possible, but the means of resolving such disputes should exclude war. This is how we communists understand coexistence. We will and will continue to insist on this coexistence, and we believe that under the current circumstances, if one does not deliberately insist on the mad policy of rocket-nuclear war, then coexistence is necessary and inevitable.

Now, some Western politicians are trying to deceive and intimidate those who do not understand communist theory and do not understand our communist philosophy. They try their best to make these people believe that since communists say they believe in the victory of communist ideology and believe in the final victory of socialism and communism in the world, this means that communists harbor aggressive intentions, want to conquer the whole world, command all humanity, etc. Such fallacies are shameless lies and slander, does this need to be proven?

The enemies of communism distort our goals because they are afraid of the impact of the peaceful policy of socialist countries on the peoples of all countries. Of course, we have never said that we want to conquer the whole world or part of the world. "Conquer" means what? This means imposing one's own conditions, one's own political system, one's own ideology on the other side by force. But this is not coexistence, but interference in internal affairs, which is war. We resolutely oppose this.

We believe that one cannot impose things that other peoples oppose and do not like on them by force. Communists are firmly convinced that any ideology, including communist ideology, cannot be promoted by force, by war, by bayonets.

However, there is another side to the matter, which capitalists try their best to conceal. No national borders can stop the spread of communist ideas, Marxist-Leninist teachings, and no army can stop the progress of human thought. Even those who are ordered to hold weapons to prevent people from accepting communist ideas often accept this progressive thought themselves, turning from anti-communist guards into carriers of what capitalists call "communist germs."

No one can stop the spread of communist ideas with any bayonets and prisons, with any violence, because the reason is very simple: Marxism-Leninism is the embodiment of the fundamental interests of the working people, it is the truth. The communist society is based on the principles of complete justice, freedom, equality, and genuine respect for people. No matter how much one tries to prevent it, no matter how much one deceives, people will eventually distinguish and understand what is false and what is true, what is bad and what is good. Our belief in the ultimate victory of the communist cause is based on this. Communism will inevitably win, but this does not mean that socialist countries will occupy other countries. No, the people of each country will weigh all the facts, and when they correctly understand the essence of Marxist-Leninist teachings, they will voluntarily choose a more progressive way of social life.

It is becoming easier and easier every day to recognize which system is more progressive and just. Millions of people have seen with their own eyes the disasters of capitalism, felt the full weight and irrationality of this oppressive system that is on their backs, and the longer they live, the more clearly they will see this, the more strongly they will feel this.

People living in capitalist countries see: capitalism—this is a stark contrast between a few people living in luxury and the working people living in poverty and semi-starvation, this is millions of unemployed people wandering the streets, this is those who still have jobs always lacking confidence in tomorrow. The working people of capitalist countries are very clear about what this means: getting sick and not having money to see a doctor and buy expensive medicine, this means not having the opportunity to send their children to school.

When people in capitalist countries compare their living conditions with those in socialist countries, it is not difficult to guess what conclusions they will draw, because citizens of socialist countries have long forgotten all these disasters. When they compare the slow pace of economic development of capitalism with the vigorous development of the national economy of socialist countries, and compare the "Cold War" policy and arms race of imperialism with the peaceful foreign policy of socialist countries and their struggle for disarmament, they can understand which social system is more just and progressive.

If today, the propagandists of capitalism can still scare some people who are not very familiar with the situation with communism, then it can be said with certainty that this is a temporary phenomenon. When these people themselves understand the truth, they will be ashamed of their past mistakes; not every grandfather dares to tell his grandson that he once opposed communism.

Some more far-sighted thinkers and politicians of capitalism have already begun to realize that the social system they are in and defending is doomed to historical extinction. They are afraid of this and try their best to delay the inevitable, trying to cover up the facts and avoid telling the truth, hoping to confuse the masses' understanding.

For example, more and more leaders and politicians of Western countries are making speeches, calling for "assistance" to economically backward countries. They say that they must feed the hungry people in these countries, otherwise they will demand their rights. Of course, when they say these words, they use various beautiful words such as generosity, humanitarianism, etc. But what does this actually reflect? It is not Christian love for one's fellow man, but the most ordinary, selfish fear of the monopolist capitalists.

Imperialists and colonialists have plundered the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for decades, even hundreds of years. They have seized incalculable wealth from these countries, deliberately keeping the people who created this wealth in poverty and ignorance, and ruthlessly exploiting them. This is the reason why dozens of countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are poor and belong to the economically underdeveloped countries today. This is not because their land is more barren than other countries or their talents and love for labor are inferior, but because foreign exploiters have seized the labor and resources of these countries and made fortunes from them. As a result, the situation is that in the capitalist mother countries, the average income of a resident is about one thousand to two thousand dollars a year, while in the backward countries, a resident has only about one hundred dollars, and some even less.

Now is the time for the plundered to awaken, they begin to realize who plundered them and who made them fall into such poverty. When they mention this, they raise their voices. For this reason, colonialists begin to feel that the time for reckoning is coming soon, so they try to find a way out of this situation.

Of course, the existence and development of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries play a huge role in raising the awareness of the colonized or formerly colonized and semi-colonized countries. The successful development of socialist countries is a fact that everyone can see. These countries, such as China and some other countries, were once in the position of exploited and economically backward countries. But today, these countries have completely changed their appearance and have achieved great success in the development of the economy, culture, and the establishment of a new society. Socialist countries have thus demonstrated with examples the superiority of socialism as a more rational and advanced social system. Capitalist gentlemen cannot avoid these facts. No matter how much they distort our Marxist-Leninist teachings, no matter how much they curse us, the eyes of the peoples of all countries are becoming brighter and brighter. They see and increasingly believe that only by getting rid of the oppression of exploiters can they gain true freedom, peace, and happiness.

A new, just society is replacing the decaying capitalist society, a society that can guarantee equal conditions and all benefits for every worker. On this new road to society, beautiful flowers of freedom, equality, prosperity, and peace bloom, and its victorious march is unstoppable. This is the law of historical development.

Representatives, comrades! On behalf of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government, I have explained to you the new proposal for reducing the armed forces. The implementation of this proposal will be a great contribution of our country to the cause of strengthening world peace.

The Soviet people are confident in their strength, confident in their bright communist tomorrow. Therefore, we will continue to bravely, firmly, and resolutely strive to achieve disarmament and ensure the conditions for peaceful coexistence. The Soviets will do everything possible to make other large and small countries follow this path.

The Soviet Union will continue to move forward unshakably on the road to building a communist society and will continue to defend the great cause of peace among the peoples of all countries.

Long live world peace!

    裁军是巩固和平和保障各国人民友谊的途径
    赫鲁晓夫同志1月14日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的报告代表同志们！
    在苏联最高苏维埃上次会议上所作的关于国际形势和苏联外交政策的报告中，已经阐明了苏联政府旨在缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平事业的极重要的措施。
    苏联政府向联合国提出的关于全面彻底裁军的建议受到了世界各国人民的极大欢迎。全面彻底裁军的主张得到联合国大会的一致赞成。
    苏联最高苏维埃致世界各国议会的呼吁书得到了社会主义国家议会和政府以及世界各洲的各国的许多议员的支持。
    苏联政府一贯地奉行和平外交政策，遵循着与不同社会制度国家和平共处的列宁主义原则，正在逐步实现全面彻底裁军建议中所提出的具体措施。
    苏联部长会议和共产党中央委员会决定把关于裁减苏联武装部队的新的具体建议提交苏联最高苏维埃本次会议审查。
    在叙述这些建议之前，请允许我谈一谈我们国内的形势、国际生活和苏联外交政策的某些问题。
    共产主义建设伟大胜利
            的一年
    代表同志们！刚刚结束的1959年将作为在我国全面展开共产主义社会建设的第一年而载入史册。苏联人民实现着苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会所通过的共产主义建设的宏伟纲领，在发展国家生产力、建立共产主义物质技术基础以及提高劳动人民物质福利和文化水平方面都取得了新的辉煌成就。已经过去的一年是苏联社会制度和国家制度进一步大大巩固、社会主义民主进一步发展、共产党的组织作用和教育作用提高的一年。这是旨在维护和巩固全世界和平、缓和国际关系中的紧张局势和进一步加强世界社会主义体系的我国外交政策取得新的胜利的一年。
    苏联人、我们的外国朋友以及所有能够清醒地估计事件的人们都完全有权利认为，1959年是共产主义建设取得新的伟大胜利的一年。它为解决对巩固和平具有重大意义的根本国际问题开辟了光辉宽广的前景。民间谚语说得好：好的开端就是成功的一半。我们的七年计划有了一个很好的开端。为了提前完成七年计划，全国广泛地开展了社会主义竞赛。全民劳动的成果是丰硕的。一年中，工业产品的生产增长了11％以上，而原计划规定为7．7％。超计划生产了价值将近五百亿卢布的产品。为了更清楚地说明这个成就的意义，可以说，革命前俄国的全部工业产品，按现在的价格计算，比这个数目还要少。
    和从前一样，在苏联经济的发展中，始终一贯地遵循着优先发展重工业的列宁主义路线。一年中生产资料的生产增加了12％，原计划规定为8．1％。黑色金属、有色金属、煤、石油、瓦斯、电力、化学品、建筑材料、机器和设备的生产都有相当大的增长。例如，按计划规定，钢产量比1958年增加四百一十万吨，而实际产量增加了五百万吨。煤的开采量规定增加六百一十万吨，而结果增产了一千零四十万吨。石油的开采量规定增加一千四百五十万吨，而一年中实际增长额为一千六百三十万吨。电力生产比去年增加二百八十六亿度，而原计划规定为二百二十四亿度，纸的生产比去年增加了九万一千吨。
    在编制七年计划时，我们的出发点是：不使在执行计划时造成过度紧张，不使各国民经济委员会、企业、党组织、工会组织以及其他社会组织和广大劳动群众在挖掘潜力、更好地利用生产能力、提高社会劳动生产率以及他们在争取超额完成七年计划任务的斗争中的主动性受到束缚。而这些考虑被证明是完全正确的。生活证明七年计划将提前完成，它的指标将大大超过。
    轻工业和食品工业正在顺利地发展。下列产品的产量比1958年增加情况如下：布匹增加了三亿四千六百万平方米，针织内衣和外衣增加了四千四百万件，皮鞋增加了三千三百万双，糖增加了五十七万六千吨。整个说来，消费品工业产值原计划增加6．6％，而实际上增加了10．3％。
    农业劳动者取得的胜利使全体人民感到喜悦和合理的自豪。最近举行的苏共中央全体会议讨论了七年计划第一年农业发展的总结，并提出了进一步发展各重要农业部门的措施。由于国内许多地区发生旱灾，1959年谷物的总收获量比1958年空前丰收的一年要低。尽管如此，国家仍采购了二十八亿四千六百万普特的粮食，这满足了居民的需求和国家的其他需要。生荒地和熟荒地开垦地区在国家粮食的平衡方面起了特别重要的作用。1959年在这些地区采购了十六亿九千三百万普特的谷物，这比开垦以前在这些地区采购的谷物增加了十亿多普特。在棉花生产方面，1959年获得了巨大的成就。
    在畜牧业方面取得了巨大的成就。1959年同1958年相比，家畜和家禽的收购量增加了一百九十万吨，奶类增加了二百九十万吨，蛋类增加了十一亿个，羊毛增加了三万八千吨。而如果同1953年相比，那么，肉类的收购量增加了一点一倍，奶类几乎增加了一点四倍，蛋类增加了一点二倍，羊毛增加了80％。
    与总产量和商品产品增长同时，全国的牲畜头数也增加了。国营农场和集体农庄的牛的头数增加了18％，其中奶牛头数增加了14％；猪的头数增加了17％，羊——6％，家禽——26％。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议和不久前举行的苏共中央全会所规定的措施的完成，将保证农业各部门的更大高涨，保证全国有丰足的农产品。
    七年计划规定的宏伟的基本建设计划已经开始实现。去年有一千多个新的大型国营工业企业投入了生产，同时，通过改建、扩建和在技术上改装现有企业而增加的新的生产能力也投入了生产。国家和集体组织的基本投资总额（集体农庄的投资不计算在内）为二千七百五十亿卢布，这个数字比1958年多三百亿卢布。
    为了完成这样一个工作计划，需要有大量的积累，而积累首先要靠提高劳动生产率、降低成本和提高企业的盈利额。这方面的七年计划任务也正在超额完成。1959年的计划规定，劳动生产率在工业中提高5．4％，在建筑业中提高8％；而实际上，劳动生产率在工业中提高了7．4％，在建筑业中提高了9％。超额完成了降低工业产品成本的计划。由于降低产品成本，仅超计划节约就达一百亿卢布以上。由于增加生产和降低产品成本，苏联工业获得的利润比前一年多20％以上，大大超过了计划的规定。社会主义经济中的利润增加是一件大事，要知道，在我们这里，利润不是装入垄断资本家的口袋里，而是用来为全体人民谋福利，用来造福社会。
    七年计划的极重要的任务之一就是保证不断提高劳动人民的生活水平。在社会主义国家里，人民的物质福利首先取决于国民收入的增加，在1959年，国民收入比前一年增加了8％，即大约增加了一千亿卢布。
    共产党和苏联政府在1959年实现了一系列旨在提高人民物质福利和改善他们的生活条件的重大措施。到去年年底已有一千三百多万职工的工作日缩短到七小时和六小时，到今年年底，苏联全体职工将完成向缩短工作日的过渡。在资本主义国家里，缩短工作日和工作周就会导致职工的工资的减少，同资本主义国家不同，我们在缩短工作日的时候，工资不仅不减少，而且在许多工业部门还大大提高了工资，特别是提高了低工资职工的工资。
    如所周知，苏联人民的物质和文化保障不仅决定于直接工资和集体农庄的劳动报酬，而且我们有另外一种只有在社会主义社会才可能有的、通过为劳动人民服务的公共设施来提高人民福利的途径。国家用于社会保险金、优抚金、助学金、免费教育和免费医疗及其他公共设施方面的开支，从1958年的两千一百五十亿卢布增加到1959年的两千三百亿卢布。
    去年建成了总面积在八千万平方米以上的住宅，即二百二十万套以上设备优良的住宅。此外，集体农民和农村知识分子建成约八十五万幢住宅。这就是说，共产党和苏联政府提出的消除住宅不足的任务正在顺利地解决。
    在轻工业、食品工业和农业产品增长的基础上，人民的消费正在继续增加。居民在国家商业和合作社商业中的购货额一年来增加了8％，食品、鞋类、衣服、文化生活用品等商品的销售量大大增加了。
    劳动人民物质福利的不断提高、保健事业和医疗工作的改进对国内人口的增长产生了良好的影响。苏联人口一年来增加了三百六十六万人，1960年初达到了两亿一千二百万人以上。
    全世界都承认苏联在国民教育以及发展科学和文化方面的卓越成就。去年进行的人口调查得出了一些有意义的数字。国内有一千三百四十万人受过高等和中等专业教育或曾经在高等学校肄业；四千五百三十万人是完全中等学校和七年制中等学校毕业的。如1939年每一千居民中只有六人受过高等教育，七十七人受过中等教育，而1959年就有十八人受过高等教育，二百六十三人受过中等教育，可喜的是，受过高等教育的人中间妇女占49％，而在受过中等教育的人中间占53％。
    以前落后的共和国中受过高等和中等教育的人数已经大大增加。例如，乌兹别克共和国近二十年来每一千人中受过高等教育的人从三人增加到十三人，而受过中等教育的人从三十九人增加到二百三十四人；哈萨克共和国受过高等教育的人从五人增加到十二人，受过中等教育的人从六十人增加到二百三十九人；塔吉克共和国分别从二人增加到十人，从二十七人增加到二百一十四人；土库曼共和国分别从三人增加到十三人，从四十六人增加到二百五十六人；阿塞拜疆共和国分别从七人增加到二十一人，从七十三人增加到二百六十一人；白俄罗斯共和国每一千人中受过高等教育的从四人增加到十二人，受过中等教育的从六十七人增加到二百二十五人。这些数字描绘出文化发展、苏维埃社会主义共和国民族干部的成长和列宁的民族政策取得胜利的一幅鲜明的图画。
    共产党和苏联政府非常注意为国民经济、科学和文化各个部门培养具有高度水平的干部。苏联高等学校学生人数几乎比英国、法国、德意志联邦共和国和意大利的高等学校学生人数的总和还多三倍。苏联在培养工程师方面早就赶过了美国。在1958年苏联培养出了九万四千名工程师，而美国只有三万五千名。苏联科学工作者共有三十多万人，为革命前俄国的三十倍。
    社会主义给人民群众开辟了通向文化教育的道路，而这正是社会主义对资本主义的伟大优越性之一。从初等学校到高等学校的广泛的免费国民教育制度，只有在社会主义的条件下才有可能实行，这种制度是我国技术进步和科学繁荣的良好基础，苏联人民有理由为这方面的成就感到骄傲。
    1959年是苏联科学家们建树了伟大的、举世公认的、新的科学功勋的一年，苏联科学家们敷设了通往宇宙、通往探索宇宙奥秘以造福人类的道路。
    去年苏联向月球方向发射的火箭已成为太阳系第一个人造行星，苏联的第二个火箭在宇宙历史上破天荒第一次到达了离我们最近的天体的表面，并把我国国徽送到了月球，而第三个苏联火箭拍摄到了地球上看不到的月球背面的照片。这些成就开辟了世界科学和技术的新纪元。
    世界上第一艘“列宁号”原子破冰船去年已交付使用。这艘船创造了我国船只在北极终年自由航行的广泛可能性。在世界舆论看来，“列宁号”破冰船同我国的原子发电站、放射性元素在医学上的应用一样，是苏联和平利用原子能的光辉榜样。
    苏联人民为了建立自己的头等工业——国民经济基础的基础，花了不少的劳动。为了达到这个目的，他们有时放弃了最必需的东西，他们不在任何困难面前停步不前，不计较力量的耗费。天才的俄国诗人勃留索夫曾经写下这样的诗句：“劳动到满头大汗，劳动而不斤斤计较——世界上一切幸福都是劳动创造”。苏联人民正是以这种态度工作的。现在大家都看到了苏联人英雄劳动的惊人成就。我国现在拥有雄厚的生产技术基地和卓越的科学家、专家和高度水平的工人，来在先进技术的基础上发展各种现代化工业。
    苏联最先开始并成功地发展着用于和平目的的原子能电站的建设工作。谁都知道我们在制造洲际航行客机方面的成就。最近，苏联飞行员在飞行速度和高度方面创造了一系列新的世界纪录。我们在制造和大批生产各种类型的洲际弹道火箭方面超过其他国家好几年。电子技术和制造复杂的计算机和操纵机在当前情况下有着重大的意义；我们在这方面有很大的成就，为这一现代化技术中最重要部门的进一步迅速发展创造了广泛的可能性。由于实现党提出的在国民经济各部门中加速技术革新的任务，工业和建筑业中广泛采用了生产的流水作业法，机械化水平、特别是繁重的工作和劳力的工作的机械化水平提高了。工业企业、建筑工业和运输部门的许多生产过程正在大规模地实现自动化。我们现在具备一切条件来实际解决从个别生产过程的自动化过渡到车间和企业工艺过程全部自动化这一任务，而将来一切工业部门整个地都将过渡到生产自动化和生产过程操纵的自动化。
    如果说资本主义国家生产的自动化会增加失业人数并给劳动人民带来痛苦和灾难，那么，在社会主义经济的条件下，自动化则为在空前地改善职工劳动条件和缩短工作日的情况下提高社会劳动生产率和增加人民财富打开了无限的可能性。
    社会主义的最顽固不化的敌人现在也不能否认苏联在经济发展和技术革新方面的迅速进展。他们现在甚至不能否认我国在经济、科学和技术发展中的卓越成就。
    最近几年我们的工农业发展指标说明，党提出的在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面赶上并超过美国的任务正在胜利地实现着。
    下面是从1953年到1959年苏联和美国在工业产品产值的增长方面的比较表：
                         苏联     　美国所有工业产品  增长90％　 增长11％按人口计算　  增长71％　 增长0．3％
      生铁　 增长57％ 　减少16％
      钢　    增长57％ 　减少16％
      煤　    增长58％ 　减少12％
      石油 　增长145％  增长9％
      电力 　增长97％ 　增长56％
      水泥 　增长143％  增长24％
    从这些材料中可以看出，我们国家最近六年如同整个苏维埃政权时期一样，在工业发展速度方面比美国优越得多。
    苏共中央十二月全会上已经指出，苏联在农业发展方面有巨大的成绩。很突出的是，1959年我国按人口平均计算的动物油脂产量超过了美国。苏联牛奶总产量赶过美国已经是第二年了。至于肉类，虽然我们在最近若干年内有了很大的增加，但是，按人口平均计算的产量仍然落后于美国，美国比我们多一点四倍。最近一年来，在畜牧业发展方面所取得的成就、饲料基地的加强以及农业劳动者提出的社会主义保证使人们产生了坚定的信心：在肉类生产方面我们也要在最近若干年内赶上美国。
    我们在七年计划第一年中所以取得辉煌成就，首先应归功于英雄的工人阶级、集体农民和苏维埃知识分子。苏联人民在用劳动建筑新的工厂、住宅和学校，把强大的技术投入生产，开采煤和石油，炼钢，制造优等的机器，栽培丰收的庄稼，增加畜产品的生产，在科学和技术方面开辟新的道路。苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议所开辟的宏伟前景，鼓舞了我国劳动人民去树立新的劳动功勋。
    在工厂、矿山、矿井、建筑工地、集体农庄和国营农场、各个经济区，都广泛地开展了提前完成七年计划任务的社会主义竞赛。在这个竞赛的过程中，涌现了成千上万光荣的先进生产方法的倡议者和共产主义劳动队的组织者。
    党和政府遵照苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议，始终不渝地实现着进一步发展社会主义民主的措施，吸引最广大的劳动人民群众来管理国家、经济和文化的建设。各加盟共和国、地方机关和社会团体的权力的扩大以及工业和建筑业管理的改组，都取得很大的成果。群众的政治和劳动积极性在不断增长，他们的创造主动性日益得到发展。
    我国的国家职能在越来越大的程度上开始由社会团体履行；公众在解决经济和文化建设的任务方面，在加强社会主义法制方面的作用在日益提高。这一点特别可以用这样一个事实来说明：苏联部长会议和党中央委员会最近通过决议，决定撤销苏联内务部，并把这个部所处理的一切问题转交各加盟共和国和地方权力机关。这样做不仅是为了精减机构，而主要的是为了进一步发展社会主义民主，提高公众在同破坏法制的现象进行的斗争中的作用，为了给地方机关以更大的权力。
    工人阶级、集体农民和苏维埃知识分子创造性的主动精神和巨大的劳动热情，是七年计划的宏伟任务将提前完成的可靠保证。
    现在国外任何人都不会怀疑苏联经济高速度的发展。现在争论的只是：我们的前进速度比美国快几倍；我们用多少时间能赶上美国。现在美国有许多著名的经济学家、实业界人士和国家领导人也积极地参加讨论这些问题。
    美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯不久前曾说：“苏联到1965年，在完成自己所提出的任务——赶上美国，特别是在工业生产上赶上美国方面将取得重大成就。”艾伦·杜勒斯在谈到社会主义国家状况时说，应当“老老实实地承认，苏联经济计划取得了非常激动人心的成果，它们在最近十年取得了惊人的成就”。
    美国参议院外交委员会在去年年底发表了经济和工业发展联合会起草的报告。报告说：“到1970年苏联大概将是一个具有强大的、比现在更加雄厚的、而在若干方面比美国的工业更加强大的工业的国家。”
    这些决不会被人怀疑为夸大我们成就和可能性的人的讲话，再一次证实苏联经济迅速发展的成就。我们坚信，在两个体系的和平经济竞赛中更进步的和更有生命力的社会主义制度必将取得胜利。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会标志了我国已经进入全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期。代表大会所批准的发展国民经济的七年计划是这个历史时期的第一阶段。现在有可能拟定苏联十五年到二十年发展国民经济的比较详尽的远景规划。这个远景规划同时也将是完成伟大的列宁所提出的历史任务——全国电气化的计划，它将成为全面展开共产主义社会建设纲领的主轴。
    苏联人民完全相信，1960年——七年计划的第二年——将在共产主义建设中获得新的辉煌胜利。
    关于当前国际形势的
            某些问题
    代表同志们，我们已经不止一次地指出，近来国际形势肯定地好转了。你们大家当然还记得几年前，例如1952—1953年国际局势是怎样的。把那些年的情况和今天对比一下，我们就只能得出一个结论：战争威胁的乌云开始消散了，尽管消散得不像期望的那样快。
    当然，如果认为最近事态的发展是一条直线，而且这条直线是从国际紧张局势某个相当高的点向国际紧张局势越来越低的点延伸，那是不正确的。如果可以像用温度计中的水银柱测量温度那样来测量国际紧张局势白热化的程度，那么这种温度计会向我们表明一系列的升降现象，不过总的趋势是这样的：国际关系中的紧张局势正在开始缓和，“冷战”的鼓吹者正在遭到失败。
    在庆祝伟大十月四十周年的苏联最高苏维埃会议上，提出了举行东西方首脑会议来缓和国际紧张局势的建议。我们现在可以高兴地指出，苏联为保证召开这次会议所作的努力已经产生了积极的结果。
    不久前，我们同美国总统艾森豪威尔、法国总统戴高乐、英国首相麦克米伦达成了协议，订于5月16日在巴黎举行政府首脑会议。还可以看到，在这次会议以后要进行一系列的最高级会晤。
    试图事先预测即将举行的会议可能产生的结果，将是轻率的，因为这些结果不仅取决于我们，而且也取决于我们的对方。但是，强调指出这一点是很重要的：那就是，将要同西方最大的国家的领导人举行认真的谈判，以便就最成熟的国际问题取得相互谅解和消除国际紧张局势的根源。至于苏联，我们希望这次会谈将是有益的和有成效的。
    我们深信，如果明智地考虑到各方的利益，大家都愿意互相迁就，那么任何一个争执问题，无论多么尖锐和复杂，都是可以在对彼此有好处和有利于加强和平的情况下得到解决的。这种有待解决的问题很多。这首先是：全面彻底裁军问题，缔结对德和约问题，其中包括建立西柏林自由城市问题，禁止试验原子武器和氢武器问题，东西方之间的关系问题。我们正是建议首先把这些问题列入即将举行的最高级会议的议程。
    由于这种会议的召开，各国人民对巩固和平和各国之间的友好合作寄予很大的希望，这是很自然的。不错，可以听到一些说法，特别是可以听到在一些小国中有人担心：大国在彼此达成协议时，会不顾小国的利益，不理睬没有代表参加会议的国家的观点。我谨在这里宣布：这种担心是没有任何根据的。在苏联方面，它过去和现在从来没有背着别的国家就直接涉及它们利益的问题进行谈判的意图。我们认为，想用牺牲其他国家利益来取得任何单方面好处的任何企图，都是同要召开的会议的目的根本不相符合的。这次会议的结果应当有利于普遍和平，从而有利于一切大国和小国。
    艾森豪威尔总统和我在戴维营举行的以及去年年初麦克米伦首相访问莫斯科时同他举行的会晤和坦率而十分有益的交谈，使人有理由期望，在即将举行的最高级会谈中，现实主义、开诚布公和合作的精神将占优势。最近的经验完全证实，国家领导人之间的直接往来和接触，是现有条件下改善国与国之间的关系和就悬而未决的国际问题达成协议的最有效的和使人产生很大希望的方法。
    再过两个月，我将应法国总统戴高乐的邀请访问法国。能去了解伟大的法国人民、我们在反对希特勒法西斯共同斗争中的盟友的生活和成就，将使我们感到很大的愉快。我国人民在历史上对法国、对在发展世界文化、科学和技术方面作出如此重大贡献的法国人民抱有好感。可以期望，我访问法国以及同戴高乐总统的会谈将在改善苏法关系以及使整个国际局势进一步正常化方面产生良好的结果。我国人民知道，戴高乐将军在法国遭到失败并被希特勒军队占领的时候，曾表现了很大的勇气。当时，许多国家领导人出卖了法国的利益，并且同占领者勾结。戴高乐将军在那些艰苦的年代里曾为了使法国摆脱占领者的压迫、为维护法国的民族荣誉而进行过斗争。
    艾森豪威尔总统将在今年6月回访我国，对于同他的会晤可以寄予很多希望。我们在戴维营曾为建立苏美两国的信任关系作了应有的努力，苏联政府希望，这一崇高的工作会在莫斯科顺利地继续下去。
    在最高苏维埃这次会议闭幕以后，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫应印度共和国总统的邀请将去印度作友好访问，同时，苏联部长会议第一副主席科兹洛夫和苏联最高苏维埃代表福尔采娃应印度政府的邀请也将去印度访问。代表团还满意地接受了尼泊尔国王和政府的盛情邀请，将前往访问这个国家。
    我们认为，这些访问将有助于加强苏印（度）人民、苏尼（泊尔）人民之间的友好关系，将有助于加强世界和平。
    大家知道，我不久就要访问印度尼西亚，我是应印度尼西亚共和国总统兼总理苏加诺的邀请到这个国家访问的。
    我们对这次访问寄予很大希望，因为我们两国有许多共同的问题，这些问题把我们联系起来。这就是进一步加强和平的问题，反对殖民主义者统治的问题，进一步巩固已经取得自由和独立的国家的经济和政治独立的问题。
    我们接到了印度总理尼赫鲁的请柬，邀请我在访问印度尼西亚的时候也访问印度。我满意地接受了这一邀请，因为我们认为，同尼赫鲁先生以及印度其他国家领导人会晤将有利于和平事业，有利于加强我们两国的友好关系。苏印两国人民的良好关系正在发展和巩固。我同尼赫鲁先生的个人关系很好。访问、新的会见和交换意见将有助于加强世界和平。
    苏联政府还接到阿富汗国王查希尔·沙阿陛下和阿富汗政府的请柬，邀请在这次出访的时候也去阿富汗访问。我们满意地接受了这一邀请。我希望能在喀布尔停留一下，以便同我们的近邻——阿富汗的国王和政府交换意见，我们同阿富汗已经建立了友好关系，这种关系正在顺利地发展。
    还接到了缅甸联邦政府的请柬，它邀请在访问印度尼西亚的时候也访问缅甸。我将愉快地接受这一盛情的邀请，再一次去访问这个国家。我想，访问缅甸并同它的政府领导人交换意见，将有利于进一步发展苏联同缅甸的良好关系，有利于巩固和平事业。
    我们还准备同意大利共和国总统格隆基会晤，他将在2月间访问苏联。我们希望，同意大利共和国总统的会晤和交谈将有助于进一步改善意大利同苏联的相互关系，将有助于我们两国人民的接近，也将有助于巩固和平事业。
    最近，国际生活中有着有利于国际紧张局势缓和的趋向。但同时也不能不看到，西方大国、首先是北大西洋公约组织的国家中一些既不喜欢国际关系转暖、也不喜欢东西方国家领导人直接接触的有影响的势力仍在进行活动。对暴利的贪欲促使某些帝国主义集团继续进行军备竞赛并保持“冷战”状态。这些集团是很有影响的，在一定的条件下，它们可能危害缓和国际紧张局势的事业。
    把自己的利益同军备竞赛政策联系在一起的政治家们害怕国际紧张局势的缓和，而且认为这种缓和不会成为事实。
    譬如说，我们可以引证美国著名的亿万富翁、纽约州州长洛克菲勒、美国前总统杜鲁门和前国务卿艾奇逊的言论。这个三连体（而且不只这三个人），对国际问题所采取的立场同在戴维营通过的苏美公报所反映的立场距离很远。这种言论是标准的“冷战”言论的样品。看来，这在某种程度上是由于：杜鲁门是前总统，艾奇逊是他的前国务卿，而这两位“前任”怎么也不能放弃现在已经破产了的以前的“实力地位”政策、“威慑”政策、“推回”政策和“战争边缘”政策。其他一些力求在美国政治生活中获得势力的人也企图步杜鲁门和艾奇逊的后尘。谁不知道，重弹“冷战”政策的老调不会预兆什么好结果。
    热中“冷战”的人一忽儿在这里、一忽儿在那边试嗓门。他们在讲话中把“冷战”的老调拉得很长，他们拿“共产主义威胁”来吓唬人。但是，这种骗人的调子早就令人厌烦了，并且引起了致力于和平的人们的愤怒。
    美国社会人士心情的变化，在洛克菲勒到全国各地作竞选旅行的期间表现得特别显著。他在对选民讲话时，不顾国际气候已经开始转暖，企图再次加剧“冷战”的气流，企图回到各国之间的关系最紧张的最糟糕的年代。结果如何呢？结果是，甚至连那些平日听从洛克菲勒这样的百万富豪和“冷战”信徒的美国人，也不喜欢这种刺耳的论调了。
    洛克菲勒显然原想骑着“冷战”之马直入白宫去尝尝总统交椅的滋味。但是，这匹马开始颠踬了，洛克菲勒了解到，这匹马驮不了他，现在骑这匹马是到不了白宫的。因此他事先声明，决定不当总统后选人。但是这种步骤可能只是一种手腕罢了。
    当然，这并不是放弃“冷战”，并不是愿意放下武器和致力于国际合作。很明显，帝国主义分子将力求重新集结“冷战”维护者的力量。爱好和平的人们应当保持警惕，不要放松争取巩固和平的努力。对于竭力保持国际紧张局势和搞扩充军备的人，对于企图利用这种政策使人类遭受到难以想像的危险来博取个人幸福和前程的人，应当更加坚决地加以揭露。
    很难相信，美国会有人不懂得新世界战争可能引起的惨重后果。如果侵略者要发动战争，那么，无论是千百万美元，还是千亿兆美元都不能保证侵略者免遭毁灭。
    美国和北大西洋公约组织其他国家中的那些今天主张继续进行“冷战”的集团，陷于这个“冷战”政策所产生的矛盾中。一方面，这些集团倾心于军备竞赛，因为军备竞赛给它们带来利润。另一方面，它们又不能不了解到，军备竞赛日益加剧战争危险，而战火将会烧掉它们所有的财产，包括靠军备竞赛所取得的利润。所以，资本主义国家的政策中有着一系列的矛盾的表现，时而出现要求国际合作的倾向，时而出现主张加剧各国之间关系的倾向。
    遗憾的是，目前美国政府在停止原子武器和氢武器试验问题上所采取的立场，就是这种矛盾倾向的表现的例子之一。
    大家都知道，苏联、美国和英国这三个拥有核武器的大国在日内瓦就停止原子武器和氢武器爆炸试验问题进行谈判已有相当长的时间了，即一年多了。这个任务的重要性是大家都明了的。自然，不能否认，在日内瓦会谈过程中，虽然进展慢，但终究取得了一定的积极的结果，这些结果有助于缔结停止试验的条约。
    在这种情况下，全世界的人民都欢迎参加会谈的每一个国家自愿作出的今后不再进行核试验的决定，认为这是个良好的、令人鼓舞的现象。世界上任何地方都没有进行原子武器和氢武器试验爆炸，这为时已经有一年多了。这件愉快的事实使各国人民有了这样一个希望：将能在最近的时间内缔结相应的国际条约，以巩固现有的局势；将会永远结束核试验。
    但是，去年12月29日，美国总统艾森豪威尔先生却发表了一个声明，其中谈到，在1959年12月31日过后，美国认为自己不再受暂缓试验核武器的义务的约束。虽然总统的声明中谈到，美国没有预先宣布，不会开始试验，但是他的声明显然意味着，美国现在可以随时恢复核爆炸。
    关于美国政府的这一决定的消息简直引起了世界各国的遗憾和不安。
    如果在目前的状况下，某个国家恢复了核武器试验，那么后果如何是不难想像的。拥有这种同样的武器的其他国家就会被迫走上这条道路。这一来就会触发核武器试验的无止境的竞赛——不问条件地试验任何威力的核武器的竞赛。首先开始进行核武器试验的政府要对各国人民负重大的责任。
    如果三大国中的任何一国决定恢复核武器试验，那就很难符合它在联合国全体会员国面前所承担的义务。不久以前闭幕的联合国大会会议反映了各国人民的意志，一致号召讨论停止核武器试验的日内瓦会议与会国为早日缔结协定作出更大的努力，并且不要恢复核武器的试验。对于这个号召，苏联、美国和英国的代表团都是投票赞成的。
    在这方面，我愿意再一次着重指出，为了给在最短时期内完成制订停止试验的条约确保最有利的条件，苏联政府今后仍将遵守自己承担的在苏联不恢复试验性核爆炸的义务，如果西方国家不开始试验原子武器和氢武器的话。
    美国总统在声明中说，达成停止核试验的协议的前景最近似乎是黯淡了。应当开诚布公地说，我们很难同意这种估价。正如我已经提到的，三国代表会议在草拟这种协定方面做了不少工作。不久以前，苏联把关于解决早些时候有重大分歧的三个问题的新建议提交日内瓦会议讨论，这三个问题是：监督委员会的成员、监督岗人员的编制以及监督委员会通过关于预算和财政问题的决议的程序。苏联这些进一步迎合西方国家态度的建议为日内瓦会议今后取得进展创造了可能。
    我们满意地注意到艾森豪威尔总统声明中的这一部分，即美国将本着致力于缔结停止核武器试验协定的始终不渝的精神来恢复谈判。
    至于苏联，它今后仍将寻求途径以克服日内瓦会议谈判过程中出现的障碍，仍将尽一切努力，以求在最近尽速缔结永久停止一切核武器试验的条约。我们认为，目前在这方面已具有可能，如果所有与会国都致力于达成协议的话。
    美国的官方人士最近说，地下爆炸是可以秘密进行而不致为任何仪器查出的。就算现代的技术有时候还不能绝对有把握地查出一切核武器的爆炸；就算有时候不容易分辨核武器的地下爆炸和地震、火山爆发。可是如果缔结了相应的协定，那么，各方面自然应当忠实履行这种协定。世界各国人民可以从中取得很大好处。在地下、水下和空中的一切核武器爆炸将会停止。人们将能坚信，大气将不会被放射性尘埃所感染。同时，科学的进一步发展将有可能绝对精确地发现和纪录各种核爆炸。
    但是，如果甚至今天还不能保证绝对准确和完全地纪录一切爆炸，那么，缔结停止试验的协议将使这个协议的参加者承担重大的义务。也很明显，大家都必须严格遵守这个协议。如果某一方破坏了自己所承担义务，那么，这个破坏者将是可耻的，会受到全世界的人民的痛斥。
    我已经说过，没有进行核爆炸已一年多了，而这是在没有国际协定约束下、各方在自愿承担义务的基础上的表现。应当认为，如果能够缔结这样的协议，那么，它就更能约束有关国家严格遵守达成的协定。
    可见，拿侦察核爆炸的技术方法不完善作为借口，并不是能够掩饰恢复地下核爆炸的好办法。如果他们想恢复在空中、地面、地下或水下进行核武器试验，那么，就让他们直截了当地说出来好了，而不要寻找形式上的借口来辩解。
    我们想再次强调指出，苏联坚决主张：必须停止在空中、地上、地下和水下进行的一切形式的核武器试验。如果仅仅通过一项只禁止在大气层中进行试验的决议，那么，这将会打破各国人民对彻底停止试验的希望。各国人民希望彻底裁军、解散一切军队，希望求得彻底禁止核武器，以便保证全世界的持久可靠的和平。
    西方国家现在愈来愈广泛地意识到：国际局势改变了，社会主义国家和资本主义国家之间的力量对比发生了根本变化。可以感觉到，恰恰是在现在，在这些国家也许特别是在美国，正在一定程度上打破多年来形成的关于东西方相互关系的性质和前景的僵死观念。国家领导人和政治活动家们的大量言论都是谈论这一题目的。例如，美国参议院所属的一些专门委员会发表了关于西方国家外交政策今后方向的、篇幅很多的研究材料。
    西方现在有不少这样的政治家：生活已经向他们证明了以往“实力地位”方针的破产，但是他们仍然不肯承认必须实行真正的和平和同苏联及其他社会主义国家真诚合作的政策。很明显，在苏联和整个社会主义阵营的辉煌胜利和成就面前惊慌失措，这就是西方国家某些集团互相矛盾的结论的根由。
    我们在美国的时候深深感到：最有远见的国家领导人、工商界人士、美国知识界人士——更不用说工人和农民了——的希望的不是要继续军备竞赛、继续神经紧张，而是安宁与和平。自从苏联发射了显示现代技术力量的人造卫星和宇宙火箭以后，美国人民牢固地认识到，美国在军事方面的致命弱点并不亚于其他任何国家。我想，谁也不会怀疑我是想用这些话来吓唬什么人。不，这是实际情况，对实际情况作出这样判断的并不单单是我们，包括美国在内的西方国家的领导人，也是这样认为的。我们不论在美国任何讲坛上谈到和平共处的必要性和裁军的必要性时，我们这些话总是不仅得到理解，而且我敢说，总是得到美国人极为良好的反应和赞同。
    现在，美国、英国、法国、意大利和其他一些国家的广大人民群众的情绪是这样高，即使那些仍然抓住“冷战”政策不放的人也不敢公开反对裁军与和平共处的思想了。因此在现阶段，他们正在适应情况、重新配置力量、随机应变，并且正力图伪装起来。但是，他们的地盘已经被摧毁，在各国人民不可抑制地向往和平的局势面前，他们的力量正在减弱。我们的任务是，不断给“冷战”拥护者以打击，要一次比一次更有力，以便使他们在世界舆论面前处于可耻的孤立地位。我们在这个崇高的事业中的最有效的武器就是苏联政府的和平政策，以及苏联政府旨在彻底消灭“冷战”的不倦的努力。
    最近几年来充满着各种各样的国际事件，这些国际事件的进程加强了苏联和一切社会主义国家的国际地位。我们完全有理由说，在苏维埃国家立国以来的全部光荣历史中，我国的国防从来没有像现在这样有可靠的保证，可以不受一切意外和外来侵犯的损害。苏联对国际事务的影响，它作为和平堡垒的威信从来都没有像现在这样大。
    国际舞台上的力量对比保证着爱好和平国家的优势。在那些维护和平事业的国家的团结一致的队伍中有苏联、中华人民共和国和一切社会主义国家。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的许多国家也越来越积极地争取巩固的和平。
      争取全面彻底裁军
    代表同志们！大家知道，我们党在第二十次和第二十一次代表大会上作出了结论：在现在局势下，战争不再是注定不可避免的，可以、也应该把战争永远从人类社会生活中排除出去。拯救人类免于战争灾难的光明大道就是全面彻底裁军。
    1959年9月18日，我受苏联政府的委托把全面彻底裁军计划提交联合国大会讨论。
    我们的建议对任何人来说都是简单明了的。所有力求使人类经历过的第二次世界大战成为最后一次世界大战、使第三次世界大战永远不会爆发的人都支持这个建议。为了不使新战争爆发，必须消灭进行战争的手段，使任何一个国家都没有可能对别国发动战争。苏联政府建议的正是这一点。我们的建议规定解散所有的武装部队和销毁各种类型的军备。
    苏联本身准备撤销军事部、解散总参谋部和废除兵役，并且建议别国也这样做。简单地说，我们建议的精神在于使各国的武装部队和军备几乎达到零点，使各国只保留有严格限制的、每个国家所同意的、配备轻型射击武器的部队，以维持内部秩序和保障公民个人的安全。
    我们感到满意的是，在联合国大会上，所有会员国一致通过了赞成全面彻底裁军思想的决议。很快就要开始讨论裁军问题的十国委员会已经受委托讨论我们的建议。
    还应当指出，我们的即将举行的谈判的对方——讨论苏联裁军建议的结果主要取决于他们——注意地对待了苏联的建议，尽管在他们的积极的声明中还作了保留，特别是关于建立监督的保留。这些保留使我们有些感到惊奇，因为在我们的建议中规定了一切必要的东西可以保证对全面彻底裁军的实现实行可靠的国际监督。
    当拟定和在政府中讨论全面彻底裁军的建议时，我们当然十分清楚地知道我们的对方对监督的态度，因此，同从前一样，特别详细地拟定了关于监督的建议，以避免可能的反对和不给西方国家的保留提供借口。可是我们仍然听到了不符合实际的老调重弹，说什么苏联的建议对裁军措施的实行没有规定充分有效的监督。
    如果我们的西方的对手关心的是真正保证有效的裁军监督，我们表示欢迎，因为我们的立场也是这样。苏联主张对裁军实行严格的国际监督。苏联主张这样一种全面彻底裁军的协定：它会令人坚信任何一方都不能破坏实现裁军的义务。我们的建议规定对裁军建立有效的国际监督，当然，这种监督应同裁军的一定的阶段相适应。
    如果西方国家对监督提出保留是为了故意刁难，为了拖延并继而破坏全面彻底裁军的协议，那就当然会使对全面彻底裁军的希望破灭，并且会引起各国人民深切的忧虑。
    西方有人硬说，裁军对资本主义国家的经济有产生严重后果的危险。据说，如果停止制造炸弹、大炮、潜水艇和其他毁灭性的手段，就会出现经济破坏，千千万万的人将失去工作和谋生手段。然而，发出这种论调的只能是那些把经济的发展只看成是使经济服从于备战利益的途径的人。
    这种论调至少可以说是毫无根据的论调。我曾经同很多美国实业界人士谈过话，他们在这方面完全不是抱着这种阴暗的观点，他们相信，美国工业完全有力量对付把整个经济转入和平产品生产的任务。
    事实上，难道没有理由期望，把生产能力转入和平产品生产会大大减少居民的赋税，增加内部市场的容量，并且把更多的经费用于教育、保健和社会赡养的需要。而摆脱了人为的限制——这种限制的理由与经济利益毫无共同之处——的对外贸易的可能性难道不会因而大大增加吗？世界上有多少个国家需要和平的用品，而不需要武器啊！
    没有疑问，裁军以后和平产品在对外贸易市场上的销路将会无限增加，世界贸易的发展将出现最广阔的前景。
    裁军不是只有利于哪一个国家或哪一个国家集团，它会为持久和平以及各国和各国人民的经济发展开辟道路。
    苏联不仅用语言而且用行动证明了它对解决裁军问题的努力。第二次世界大战刚一结束我国武装部队就实行大规模复员。在以后的年代里，苏联完全撤除了它在别国领土上的军事基地。
    苏联又继续进行了努力。为了结束军备竞赛并尽可能迅速地着手实现裁军的实际步骤，我们进一步裁减了自己的武装部队。大家知道，最近四年来苏联单方面裁减的武装部队的人数共达二百一十四万人。苏联军队已经撤出了罗马尼亚人民共和国，大大减少了根据现有的协定我们驻扎在德意志民主共和国、波兰人民共和国和匈牙利人民共和国的军队人数。
    我想向最高苏维埃各位代表报告一下最近三十多年来我国武装部队人数的变化情况。
    在国内战争结束以后，苏联政府使大部分军队复员了，并改组了军队。因此，到1927年，红军和海军就剩下了五十八万六千人。这在某种程度上也是由当时的国际环境决定的。
    日本帝国主义在远东的侵略和德国法西斯的上台执政，是我国武装部队人数增加的原因，到1937年，我国武装部队的人数达到了一百四十三万三千人。
    后来，由于第二次世界大战的爆发造成了希特勒德国侵犯苏联的直接威胁，我国武装部队又有了增加，到1941年达到四百二十万零七千人。
    希特勒德国背信弃义地进攻苏联和爆发了四年的流血战争，使我们不得不把我国武装部队到1945年5月增加到一千一百三十六万五千人。
    由于战争结束后马上复员，到1948年，苏联武装部队的人数裁减到二百八十七万四千人。苏联当时所以要大量裁减自己的武装部队，是因为它希望西方国家能本着维护和平和友谊的思想来加强反希特勒同盟国之间所形成的关系。但是，我们的希望落空了。由于西方成立了北大西洋公约组织这个侵略集团，并搞原子弹讹诈的把戏（当时我们还没有原子弹），为了巩固国防以防可能发生的挑衅，苏联不得不增加军队的人数，苏军人数在1955年为五百七十六万三千人。
    后来，在1955—1958年期间，我在前面已经说过，武装部队裁减了二百一十四万人，而现在苏联武装部队的总人数为三百六十二万三千人。
    这就是最近几十年来有关苏联武装部队状况的材料。裁减苏联武装部队的新建议
    各位代表同志！苏联政府今天把再一次大量裁减苏联武装部队的建议提交最高苏维埃审查。也像过去一样，我们认为，不管十国裁军委员会或者其他国际机构讨论裁军问题的进程如何，单方面裁减武装部队是可能的。
    苏联部长会议把再次裁减我国武装部队一百二十万人的建议提交给大家审查和批准。如果最高苏维埃采纳了这项建议，那么我们的陆海军人数将为二百四十二万三千人。
    这一来，我国武装部队的人数就将低于美国、英国和法国在1956年讨论裁军问题时所提出的建议中规定的数目。在那个建议中规定苏联和美国的武装部队的人数各为二百五十万人。我们同意了这项建议，并且自己也不止一次地提出过这项建议，当然，我们的出发点是，这仅仅是裁减武装部队方面的第一步。譬如，我们在苏联政府1956年秋天提交联合国大会审查的建议中就提到这些数字。从那时起，三年多的时间过去了，可是，还没有就这个问题达成协议。现在提出了把武装部队裁减到更低的数额的建议，并且是我们自己这样做的，我们毫不拖延地做，不必多耗费时间和精力，不必因为跟我们的对方在裁军问题上进行无休止的争论而大伤脑筋。
    我们深信，各位代表同志将全面地讨论政府提交给苏联最高苏维埃会议审查的建议，并且将正确地理解党中央和苏联政府这样做的动机。
    每个苏联公民，尤其是最高苏维埃的代表——人民的代表首先关心的是祖国的安全，保卫革命的果实，保证我国顺利地建设共产主义。因此，由于所提出的建议而产生的第一个问题是：在实现了所提出的措施之后，我国是否还有足够的国防威力？为什么在我们的敌人甚至连“实力地位政策”这个词也未放弃的时候，我们不以实力回敬实力，却仍然要裁减军队和舰队，从而缩减军费呢？这该作怎样的解释呢？我们对我国的安全是不是有些不关心？
    我们反复而全面地研究了这个问题，同军人和总参谋部商量过，我们可以毫不犹豫地回答：我们的防御力量是十分充足的，我们现实地考虑了一切。
    有什么根据来证实这些现实的估计和作出这样重大的决定呢？有什么根据使代表们在通过这项决定时坚信它无损于我国的防御力量呢？
    我们确信所提出的措施的正确性的根据是，苏维埃国家正处在整个国民经济空前蓬勃发展的时期。我们的这种信念是以苏维埃社会不可摧毁的精神上和政治上的团结为基础的。苏联科学家、工程师和工人保证我国军队能够装备迄今人们还不知道的各种类型的武器——原子武器、氢武器、火箭武器和其他现代化武器。我国经济的发展和科学技术思想的成就为裁减武装部队创造了条件。此外，我们还考虑到强大的社会主义阵营的加强和壮大，它是和平的坚强堡垒。
    由于列宁主义思想的胜利、社会主义的建成和共产主义建设的进一步顺利发展，苏联今天在经济方面，在提高劳动人民生活水平方面，在发展科学、技术和文化等等各方面都在前进。在这些成就的基础上，我国从事国防工业的科学家、工程师和工人制造出了最现代化的、符合最新科学技术成就的新式武器。这就使我们有可能裁减武装部队而不损害国防力量。
    代表同志们，请允许我代表你们、代表苏联政府和苏联共产党中央委员会向所有的科学家、工程师、技术人员和工人，向所有那些献出自己的全部知识和劳动来造福祖国和加强祖国威力的人们致最衷心的谢意。
    党、政府和全体苏联人民热烈地感谢科学家、工程师、技术人员和工人，因为他们的知识和劳动在制造原子武器和氢武器、火箭设备和其他各种武器方面获得了巨大的成绩，这些武器大大提高了我国的国防能力，从而使我们现在有可能进一步裁减武装部队。
    苏联储存了必要数量的原子武器和氢武器。在没有就禁止核武器问题达成协议之前，我们不得不继续生产这种武器。当然，我们得在这方面花费不少的资金。但是，现在我们还不能完全放弃核武器的生产。这个问题的解决应当是拥有核武器的国家达成协议的结果。
    我国掌握着强有力的火箭技术。在现代军事技术发达的条件下，空军和海军已经失去了它过去的意义。这类武器不是要削减，而是要被代替。空军几乎全部在被火箭技术代替。我们现在已经大大减少了轰炸机和其他过时的技术装备的生产，看来，今后还要继续减少，甚至停止这种生产。在海军中潜水艇有重大的意义，而水上舰艇已不能再承担它过去所承担的角色了。
    我国的武装部队已经在很大程度上转用火箭—核武器。这种武器正在日益完善，而且将继续完善，直到被禁止为止。
    代表同志们，苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府可以向你们报告，我们已经拥有的武器是威力很大的武器，而那些所谓就要出场的武器将更加完善，更有威力。正在制造中的或者说在科学家和设计师皮包中的那些武器简直是不可思议的武器。
    代表同志们，你们大家一定会同意，现在不能像若干年以前那样对待军队的人数问题了。只要说说这样一点就够了，从1955年以来，我国武装部队的人数减少了三分之一，而他们的火力由于采用和发展了各种最新式的现代化军事技术却增长了好多倍。
    当前决定国防力量的不是我们有多少士兵肩荷枪支，有多少人身穿军大衣。如果抛开我已经说过的一般的政治和经济因素，那么国家的防御力量在决定性的程度上取决于火力如何，取决于这个国家掌握着什么样的发射工具。
    这次提出的裁减绝不会削弱我国武装部队的火力，要知道，这是主要的。实际上，国家正是为了这个目的才维持军队，以便拥有相应的火力，足以抗击可能的敌人和制止敌人的侵犯，或者予以应有的回击，如果敌人竟敢侵犯我国的话。
    现在苏联军队掌握着任何军队从未有过的战斗工具和火力。我再一次强调指出，我们已经拥有许多核武器——原子武器和氢武器以及向可能的侵略者的领土发射这种武器的相应的火箭，如果哪个疯人挑起对我国和其他社会主义国家的进犯，我们可以把进犯我们的一个国家或数个国家干脆从地球上消灭掉。
    每个头脑冷静的人都清楚地知道，原子武器和氢武器对人口稠密的国家是最大的威胁。当然，一旦发生新的世界大战，无论怎样各国都要遭殃。我们也会遭到很大的灾难，我们将会有许多人牺牲，但是我们将存在下去，我们的领土辽阔广大，人口比起其他许多国家来不太集中在大工业城市里。最遭殃的将是西方。如果侵略者发动新战争，那么这种战争不仅是他们最后一次战争，而且也是资本主义的末日，因为各国人民清楚地知道，资本主义是产生战争的根源，他们再也不能容忍这种给人类带来灾难和贫困的制度了。
    如果考虑到这一切，苏联人就可以感到放心和有把握了：苏联军队的现代化装备完全可以保证我国使敌人接近不了。
    当然，使敌人接近不了这一概念是有条件的。因为不能忘记，我们的敌人——而某些国家毫不掩饰自己的军事政治目的，公然称自己为我们的敌人——不会原地不动。如果说这些国家现在还没有像我们那样多的火箭，而它们的火箭也不如我们的完善，那么它们是有可能挽回暂时的落后、改善自己的火箭技术，也许迟早会赶上我们。
    例如，美国给自己提出了五年内在生产火箭方面赶上苏联的任务。美国自然要竭尽全力使火箭技术摆脱它目前在美国所处的状况，并且取得较好的地位。但是，如果设想我们在这段时间会袖手坐待，就未免太天真了。就连美国本国也有人说：怎么，俄国人会等待我们，会掷骰子玩儿？
    的确，我们当然将尽一切努力利用我们所赢得的时间来发展火箭武器，并且在这方面占领先地位，直到就裁军问题达成国际协议为止。
    但是，会产生这样一个问题：既然不排斥某些资本主义国家在现代武器方面同我们较量的可能性，难道它们不会施展狡计首先进攻我们，以便利用火箭—原子武器这类可怕武器袭击的突然性这个因素来取得保证胜利的优势么？不会。现代的作战工具不会给任何一方以这样的优势。
    对于首先发动进攻的人来说，进攻并不需要很大的理智，而是需要轻举妄动，我们自然认识到，我们的某些可能的敌人有这种趋向。往往会看到，时而在这个国家，时而在那个国家，“实力地位”政策的拥护者表现出急躁和头脑发热，尽管希特勒的“桂冠”本来应当对他们起冷却作用。但是看来，这些人的意识已糊涂到忘记了这些严重的历史教训的程度。
    但是，假定某个国家或某个国家集团准备了和实现了对拥有核武器和火箭武器的国家的突然进攻，即或进攻的一方在仓卒之间打击到了别人，难道它能一下子毁掉遭到进攻的国家境内的全部核武器储备和全部火箭技术装置么？当然不能。受到突然进攻的国家——自然这里指的是相当大的国家——将永远有可能给侵略者以应有的回击。
    我们考虑到在我国周围有外国的军事基地。因此，我们的火箭技术的配置保证我们有双重和三重的对付手段。我国幅员广大，我们有可能分散火箭技术，并很好地加以掩护。我们建立这样一种系统：如果一些用以回击的武器坏了，那么总有备用的武器可以使用，并且能从后备阵地上击中目标。对于精神正常的人、对于那些行动对人民负责并且珍重人民命运的人，这一切足以起清醒作用了。当然，对疯人是不能信赖的；这种人过去一直有过，显然，将来他们也不会绝种。只是不要忘记，如果说，过去疯人的上台执政导致了流血战争，那么，现在这将是无可比拟的灾祸。
    一个母亲离开家里时，总是操心燃料、火柴或电力用具不致落到无知的孩子手里，以免他们无意识地给房子和城市造成巨大的灾害，同样地，各国人民也应该操心，不要让抱着疯狂的罪恶目的的人钻进政府、议会以及对保障和平密切相关的其他岗位。各国人民必须保持高度的警惕，不让疯人利用火箭—核武器来反对人类，直到求得全面彻底裁军问题的解决，也就是求得销毁一切战争武器的问题的解决为止。
    不要忘记过去的教训
    西方国家的领导人仍然没有放弃“实力地位”政策和“战争边缘”政策。虽然这个政策的主要代言人已经死去，但是他的好战口号还没有放进档案库，还没有被抛弃。特别热衷的是阿登纳总理。但是，阿登纳先生和那些喜欢同他一道重弹要继续奉行“实力地位”政策老调的人应该现实地正视事实。
    当西方国家在经济上占优势，并且垄断着像原子弹这样有力的武器时，在这样的政策中还有某种逻辑，尽管在当时这也没有为奉行“实力地位”政策提供理由。
    现在，苏联拥有了原子武器和氢武器，我们国家向全世界显示了自己在火箭技术方面的优势，苏联和社会主义阵营各国的经济在蓬勃发展，社会主义阵营团结一致、世界各国人民都致力于保障和平，在这样的条件下，“实力地位”政策就成为完全无意义的了。
    在力量对比关系已经发生变化的现在，把赌注放到“实力地位”政策上意味着什么呢？这意味着事先注定必然要遭到失败，意味着步希特勒的后尘。
    大家都知道，正是希特勒露骨地奉行了“实力地位”政策。当他登台执政以后，立即就提出了任务要执行扩张、夺取所谓生存空间的政策。他曾宣布，要用战争对付苏联，要打到乌拉尔，使其他国家屈服。
    大家对第二次世界大战前发生的事件还是记忆犹新。希特勒曾恬不知耻地、露骨地告诉自己的同伙：“我们必须抛弃一切温情，要成为坚定的人。有朝一日，我命令开始战争，我将毫不犹豫，把千百万青年人投入死亡。”希特勒认为其他的种族和民族是优等阿利安种族的肥料和奴隶，阿利安种族应当统治所有的人。
    为了掩饰这些罪恶的目的，希特勒把自己的党称为国家社会党（按：根据原文，可以译为“国家社会主义党”——译注）。法西斯魁首把最受各国人民欢迎的“社会主义”这个词挂在嘴上，以便把更多幼稚的和没有经验的人骗到自己的一边。
    希特勒在推行侵略政策时，经常提出最后通牒，如果最后通牒被拒绝的话，他就开始军事行动。他用这种办法侵占了许多欧州国家。陶醉于轻易得来的胜利的希特勒向苏联发动了强盗式的进攻。大家都知道，这场冒险得到了什么下场。这个下场是：当苏联军队已经在柏林进行巷战的时候，这个疯子找到了正确的决定——自己把自己杀死了，就像落在火圈中的蝎子一样。
    应当指出的是：在第二次世界大战前夕，苏联是处在资本主义包围中唯一的社会主义国家。当时，在经济和其他资源方面占优势的不是我们。现在的情况就完全不同了。每一个人，凡是思想健全，能够稍微考虑和理解战后时期所发生的事件的，都不会不看到国际舞台上的力量对比关系发生了有利于社会主义的变化。
    在目前条件下，对苏联和其他社会主义国家实行“实力地位”政策就等于走上冒致命危险的道路，这难道不是很清楚的吗？
    这种冒险政策现在在西德表现得最为明显。大家知道，希特勒夺取政权后最早的反动措施之一就是取缔共产党和迫害工人组织。阿登纳也禁止德国共产党进行活动，并且对工会和劳动人民的其他民主组织展开进攻。在西德接二连三地对和平运动的活动家进行可耻的审判。还再能干出什么来呢？即使从德意志联邦共和国宪法的角度来看，一些人仅仅因为根据自己的信念起来争取和平就被关进监狱，这种做法也是逞凶和非法的行为。
    近来西德越来越明显地表现出一种想粉饰，甚至几乎是想恢复希特勒血腥制度的名誉的倾向。利物浦的罗素勋爵很好地指出了这种倾向。罗素在他写给“泰晤士报”编辑部的信中提醒注意这样一个事实，即德意志联邦共和国1958年出版的中等学校历史课本同1949年出版的历史课本不同，对国会纵火案、迫害犹太人、集中营的兽行这样一些希特勒制度的罪行和其他一些法西斯恶行都避而不谈。
    罗素在自己的信中从德国“世界报”上援引了关于这方面的具体资料。例如，关于希特勒分子烧毁国会大厦的案件，在1949年出版的德国历史课本中还用了两页半的篇幅来叙述，而1958年出版的课本却只字不提；关于对犹太人的迫害，前者用了三页，而后者只留下十四行；关于集中营，前者用了五页，而现在也只字不提。
    最近在西德各城市掀起的法西斯反犹太活动是反动势力猖獗活动的明显标志。反动势力的各种阴谋早已为世界公众所知晓。还在好几十年前，在沙皇俄国反动派嚣张的时期，就不止一次地掀起过黑色百人团的反犹太人的暴行。列宁、布尔什维克们以及所有的进步人士都坚决地反对这种可耻的现象。
    在德国，希特勒曾加紧煽动反犹太人主义。他压制一切自由，粗暴地蹂躏民主权利。他所干的这些都是为了开始自己血腥的事业——发动战争。
    苏联过去主张、现在仍然主张各国人民之间友好，主张同德国人民友好。我们同德意志民主共和国建立了非常良好的友好关系，我们珍视这种友谊。我们正在尽一切努力，使我们同西德的德国人也能有良好的友谊关系。但是，德意志联邦共和国政府、特别是它的总理阿登纳煽动“冷战”的活动，使我们感到非常不快。
    我们曾经听到阿登纳先生担保说，他不是复仇主义者，并且他决不会允许在自己的政府中有任何复仇主义者担任部长。德国人民的确不愿意同复仇主义者有任何共同之点。但是，一方面阿登纳总理作这样的保证，一方面西德政府却力图修改在第二次世界大战以后所确定的欧洲各国的疆界，并且极端敌视主张消除第二次世界大战残迹、缔结对德和约和确立欧洲持久和平的任何声明，这两种情况怎么能够协调起来呢？
    其次，拿阿登纳最近的西柏林之行和他的挑衅言论来看，他说：“如果竟至发生原子战争，苏联将荡然无存。”所有这一切都使人认为，阿登纳并没有从德国法西斯分子所领取的教训中得出结论，反而正在走上他们的老路。应当认为，阿登纳不致被希特勒的下场迷住心窍。
    可以非常肯定地说，如果目前被纵容取得权力和指挥权、组织联邦国防军并指挥北大西洋公约组织武装部队的狂妄的法西斯分子在西德占了上风，如果这些败类竟想爬出本国国界的话，那么，他们不但不能像希特勒发动侵略时那样爬到莫斯科和斯大林格勒，而且在本国领土上就会被粉碎。
    任何声明都不能掩饰德意志联邦共和国政府的政策中有着十分危险的倾向这一事实；如果爱好和平的力量不制止这种倾向，这种倾向就可能引起非常悲惨的后果，引起第三次世界大战。
    德意志联邦共和国的备战活动得到法国、英国和其他曾遭到希特勒侵略的国家的支持，这种现象不能不使人感到惊奇。这些国家怎么能促使西德重新武装，怎么能用自己的双手协助它建立起军队并用现代化武器装备这支军队呢？
    北大西洋公约组织中的西德盟国的一些政客坦率地说（当然，不是当着大庭广众，而是背着人）：请相信我们并理解我们的意思，如果德意志联邦共和国不参加北大西洋公约组织，如果它没有军队，没有军备开支，它就会在经济上占极大的优势而压倒西方其他国家，就会成为更加危险的贸易竞争的对手。而西德的经济的确比北大西洋公约组织中除去美国以外的其他成员国要强大和发达。这样一来，对于这些西方政客来说，在和平的基础上发展西德经济是一件非常危险的事情，而把德意志联邦共和国拖入北大西洋公约组织并让它参加军备竞赛，却好像是一件好事！他们不反对给他们的西德对手加上军备和大批武装部队的负担，以便在经济上削弱西德，为同它在世界市场上进行竞争创造有利的条件。
    持有这种非常奇怪的主张的人忘记了。他们把武器交给德国复仇主义者，而在使用这些武器的时候却不会请示给他们武器的人。要知道德意志联邦共和国政府掌握了武器，就要追求自己的目的，它想依靠军队和强大的经济在西欧占据统治地位并操纵它的北大西洋公约组织的盟国。实际上它的这个目的也快要达到了。西德已经掌握着北大西洋公约组织中许多重要职位。
    法国、英国、比利时和北大西洋公约组织其他国家的士兵现在要听从西德将军斯派达尔的命令。但是法国人都知道这位将军是希特勒的亲信，是法国军官部队第五纵队的组织者，以后又是1940年占领法国的希特勒部队的参谋长。而英国人知道他是希特勒轰炸机空袭英国领土的策划者之一。而正是这个未被打死的希特勒分子现在是北大西洋公约组织中欧地区的陆军统帅。
    当时，西方三国政府为了替西德加入北大西洋公约组织辩白，硬说巴黎协定将会保护欧洲国家不受正在恢复力量的西德的侵害。美国已故的国务卿杜勒斯1955年11月在日内瓦外长会议上说：“德意志联邦共和国放弃拥有原子武器、细菌武器和化学武器的权利。这难道有人反对吗？根据布鲁塞尔条约，联邦共和国的军事设施和军备要受布鲁塞尔条约委员会（它主要代表过去受德国侵略之害的国家）的监督和控制，这难道也有人反对吗？”
    说说是一回事，而实际情况怎么样呢？有人硬说，让西德加入北大西洋公约组织可以控制它的军事经济和军备，而事实上却造成了这样一种局面，即西德获得了控制自己欧洲盟国的可能，并且力图对美国的政治方针施加压力。而实际上，如果今天阿登纳在军备中获得了原子火箭武器，那么巴黎协定最初所规定的对西德的小小限制还留下了什么呢？布鲁塞尔条约和巴黎协定的制订者只好守着被西德黩武主义者的复仇主义政策所一笔勾销了的这些条约和协定的死条文聊以自慰罢了。
    请看看阿登纳总理在新年前夕所发表的文章中号召了一些什么。按照惯例，国家领导人要在这一天发表和平祝词和对人民祝福。阿登纳却不是这样做的。他仍然致力于继续奉行“实力地位”政策，大声疾呼在实行这种政策时要“果断而坚决”。最近以来出现的国际紧张局势的缓和对他来说仅仅是一种“幻觉”。阿登纳总理说，现在“比任何时候更加有必要增加”北大西洋公约组织和西德的军事威力。
    同志们，所有这一切一次又一次地证实，苏联政府早就坚决主张的、同两个德国签订和约的任务已经多么成熟了。这种条约会彻底清除第二次世界大战留下的问题，可以保证整个德国和平民主的发展，并且使德国的邻国相信西德不再走新侵略的道路。
    苏联政府认为，对德媾和是一个迫切的国际问题，是具有头等重要性的问题。
    我们将竭尽一切努力来使这个问题终于得到解决。我们真诚地希望同我们那些对希特勒德国作过战的同盟国一起努力寻求解决德国问题的办法。在这方面，我们希望，这样作将使西柏林问题也在共同商定的基础上得到解决。但是，如果我们同两个德国缔结和约的一切努力仍然不能成功，那末苏联就将和其他也准备同德意志民主共和国签订和约的国家一道，同德意志民主共和国签订和约，并考虑到由此产生的一切后果。苏联建议的爱好和平的目的
    代表同志们！也许在一部分苏联公民以及我们的朋友——其他国家的和平人士中间会产生这样的问题：苏联军队的再一次大量裁减是否会助长反对我们的军事集团更加猖獗起来呢？美国将有比苏联更多的大规模武装部队。德意志联邦共和国现在拥有九个师，可以预料，在不久的将来它将拥有十二个师。北大西洋公约组织司令部仅在欧洲就拥有约五十个师。此外，参加北大西洋联盟的欧洲国家本国指挥的军队有三十多个师。
    在这种情况下，裁减苏联军队是否会使我国、而且不仅我国，还有和平事业遭到危险呢？这是否会使侵略势力、使共产主义的敌人馋涎欲滴而对苏联和其他社会主义国家发动战争，从而使人类陷入一场新的血腥大屠杀呢？这是否会危害苏联的——用西方流行的说法——“威慑力量”？
    我们考虑过这个问题，现在我们可以告诉最高苏维埃，我们祖国的国防力量决不会有丝毫的削弱。在现在的条件下，战争不像过去那样打法，它跟过去的战争也很不一样，以前各国总是把军队部署在尽量靠近本国边境的地方，为的是在紧要关头用士兵和大炮筑起一道活的屏障。假如有某个国家想侵入另一个国家的疆界，它就需要向这些防守边境的军队进攻。战争往往就是这样开始的。起初，激烈的战事发生在交战国的边境上，军队也是往那儿集结的。
    现在如果发生战争，作战的方式就不同了，因为各国将拥有可以把武器发射到几千几万公里开外的办法。战争将首先在交战国的内地开始，同时，不仅在战争爆发的头几天而且在头几分钟内，一切首都、一切大工业中心或行政中心、一切战略地区无一能免于遭到袭击。因此，如果发生战争，它一开始就不一样，战事的发展也不一样。
    减少军队的人数并不影响我们保持应有的国防力量。我们仍然会拥有保卫国家的一切必要手段，敌人会清楚地了解这一点，如果他们不了解，那么我们就警告他们并且直截了当地宣布：我们裁减武装部队的数量，而并不减弱它的火力，相反，我们要在质量上把火力增强好多倍。
    如果西方的伙伴们不同意效法我们的做法，那不仅会使进步人士感到失望，也将使各国人民感到失望。如果西方国家继续顽固不化，那么这正说明它们侵略成性、一心想继续扩军备战。他们执行军备竞赛政策的结果将使他们在人民群众面前进一步暴露自己。
    在经济方面，这种政策将加重资本主义国家的预算负担，加重纳税负担。
    当然，在没有就全面彻底裁军达成协议之前，我们仍不得不为国防目的花费一定的资金，但是这种费用在武装部队减少的情况下将会减少。此外，这些资金将得到更有效的利用。显然，这样的情况是对我国有好处的，它将促进我国经济威力的增长，为提高生活水平、进一步增加物质福利、扩大住宅建筑创造更多的可能性，并促进工作日的缩短。结果会是这样：跟我们敌对的军事集团成员国中的庞大军队不由自主地成了我们的盟友，使我们更易于解决我们的主要任务——在科学、在机器和劳动工具的生产，在消费品生产以及在满足人的需求等方面超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    我想回答由于我们提出裁军建议外国会流行的臆测，我们的敌人对苏联新的、而且是惊人的裁减武装部队的措施想必要散布这种臆测的。
    在西方国家，常常有人胡说什么苏联致力于裁军是由于我们在实现发展苏联国民经济七年计划方面遇到了某种困难。他们竟至说苏联提出裁军建议只是为了腾出力量来完成七年计划。当然，这不是别的，只不过是对苏联不怀好意的人的捏造。如果西方有人认为苏联的经济状况不能维持为保证我国国防力量所必要的军队，那么，对于这样想的人来说就更加没有好处。
    我已经说过，我们的经济正在胜利发展并且空前地繁荣。而我们的未来将更加美好，因为我们在七年计划的第一年不仅完成了计划，而且超计划生产了许多产品。因而，我们不但没有困难，而且创造了大大超额完成七年计划的有利条件。可见，关于完成七年计划有困难的论调是站不住脚的。
    还有人可能企图把我们裁减武装部队的建议说成是完全出于节约和积累资金的考虑。你们知道，节约问题永远是迫切的，永远具有重大的实际意义。费用愈少，非生产的开支愈少，就会有更多的资金用于生产资料的再生产，用于发展经济，从而提高产品产量，更充分地满足人民的物质和精神需要。
    政府提交最高苏维埃审查的裁减苏联武装部队的建议将使每年大约节省一百六十亿—一百七十亿卢布。我国人民，我们国家将节约很大一笔资金。这将大大促进我国经济计划的完成和超额完成。
    取消非生产性的开支，寻找更多的办法来发展经济，这不仅是摆在我们面前的、也是摆在任何一个国家面前的经常的任务。我再说一遍，这永远是个迫切的问题，应当始终予以密切的注意。但是，不能把国防问题限定在价值概念上，也不能限定在节约的任何概念上。我们不是舍本逐末的人，当我国人民的生命、我国的生存可能遭到威胁的时候，我们不会去追求卢布。
    我们裁减武装部队不是由于经济上和预算上的虚弱，而是由于力量和威力。我们这样做，是出于我国人民的和平愿望。每个人都应当明白，如果局面需要增加维持军队的开支，那么，我们的预算和我们的经济可以提出的远不止上百亿卢布，用来巩固我国的安全。如果我国遭到直接的进攻危险，那么，我们不仅可以维持现有的武装部队，而且还可以大大地增加。我们的预算、我们的经济是可以负担起的，而且我们同时还能充分保证完成七年计划的投资。
    我们建议现在裁减我国武装部队，这里所遵循的是什么呢？我们所遵循的是崇高的人道主义的理想，这种理想是我们先进的世界观所固有的。的确，社会主义社会的整个生活都渗透了这种理想。我们对待这一问题不是从实力政策的立场出发，而是从理智的立场出发。
    我们所以要裁减我国的武装部队，是因为我们不希望战争，因为我们不打算侵犯任何人，不想威胁任何人，也没有任何侵略目的。今天，庞大的军队以及远离本国国境的军事基地，都是用来侵略，防御是不需要它们的。我们裁减武装部队的人数，也就说明我国的意图不是侵略的，而是最和平的。要知道，任何一个蓄意侵犯另一个国家或另一些国家的国家，都不会单方面裁减自己的武装部队，因为要侵略就不仅要使用自己的火力，其中包括核武器和火箭技术，而且也需要增加军队的人数。
    代表同志们！我们现在正在解决一个具有重大历史意义的问题——裁减武装部队的问题，也就是在为进一步缓和国际紧张局势开辟道路，为加强世界和平开辟道路。这一行动必将引起世界各国人民的共鸣。就是最恶毒的“冷战”鼓吹者也不能说这一行动是为了准备战争。
    我们的人民和共产党非常尊敬和爱戴我们的兵士、水兵、中士、军士、军官、陆海军将领和元帅，因为他们一直忠心耿耿地为苏联人民的利益、为伟大的马克思列宁主义理想而服务。在国内战争和伟大的卫国战争时期为争取祖国的自由和独立而流血牺牲的、苏联人民的英勇儿女是永垂不朽的。苏联人深深感谢那些英勇击退敌人的攻击、并且在过去和现在一直不惜力量加强自己祖国的威力、捍卫苏联人民的和平劳动的人。
    苏联人民将以十分满意的心情欢迎进一步裁减武装部队的措施，实现这个措施以后，将有很大一部分军人同志回到企业、工地、集体农庄和国营农场、科学机关和学校去工作。
    由于政府提出裁减如此大量的苏联武装部队的建议（我相信，这个建议一定能得到代表们的一致赞同的），苏维埃机构和党组织将要进行大量工作。我们认为，实现这个措施大约要一年到一年半，或者二年的时间。因为即将要免除大批人的兵役。做这件工作时必须避免不必要的匆忙、不要给他们造成困难。必须认真地作好准备工作，保证复员军人都有工作，并得到妥善安排。对于普通战士和士官来说，这项任务比较容易解决：他们服役的年限不长，有劳动技能，因此可以回去重操旧业。此外，这些人年纪都很轻，他们很容易就能学会适合于他们的手艺。
    比较重要和复杂的问题是，给军官和政治工作人员，即职业军人干部安排工作的问题。应当对这些人十分关心。我们武装部队的军官干部是受过良好训练的。他们曾以全副精力去研究军事科学和军事艺术，以便很好地为祖国服务。现在他们就要转业了，要把自己的知识用到另一个岗位上，但是仍然是为了共同的事业——列宁思想的胜利，共产主义的胜利。
    我们应当关怀和热爱这些同志，使他们在新的劳动集体中，在他们新的工作环境中，感到很愉快。应该帮助他们学好专业，以便保证他们能够得到应有的工资。每个人都能够选择一项称心的工作，这在我们这里是有很好的条件的。在新的集体中，他们应当受到友爱的、兄弟般的接待，为他们创造温暖和关怀的环境，帮助他们获得知识，以便他们更好地把自己的力量用到新的岗位上，虽然不是军事岗位，但是仍然是为了解决同样的任务——进一步加强国家的威力，发展经济和文化，使共产主义获得胜利。
    今天这些干部参加生产，如果局势需要，他们可以重返英勇的苏军队伍，以便履行自己对祖国的职责。
    应当给予复员军人和军官转入新的生活轨道的时间。也许应该成立训练班来使他们获得新技能。我们将发展民用航空，一部分飞行员的知识和经验将在本行岗位上得到应用。一部分炮兵和飞行员将编成新的火箭部队，他们中间很多人可能要被安排到相应的国民经济部门去从事生产。
    可见，不是对复员军人随便安插一下就行了，而是要使他们得到妥善的安顿，使他们不仅在物质上得到保障，而且在精神上也感到满意，觉得自己在为共同的事业工作，是共产主义建设的积极参加者。这是复杂而重大的任务，我们应当十分负责地加以解决。
    代表同志们，我想同你们谈谈对未来的一些看法，这些看法涉及到我们武装力量的进一步完善，当然这是指到那时在解决全面彻底裁军问题上还没有取得进展的情况而言。政府和我们党中央委员会目前正在考虑和研究以后在建军方面过渡到地区制度的问题。
    可能，这将是重复弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁在苏维埃政权的最初年代采取过的办法，不过是在不同的条件下，意义也有些不同。我们认为，地区制度将能保证必要的干部和受过军事训练并能掌握现代武器的居民名额。
    展望将来，可以想像，我们可能有按照地区原则编制成的军队。每个军中人员将能不脱离生产地掌握军事技术，一旦必要，相应的运输工具——飞机和其他军事技术——就可以把军队集中到我们境内所需要的地方。我讲这番话，是为了让大家在通过关于这次裁减我国武装部队的决议时，也注意到将来在未能就裁军问题达成协议的情况下可能发生的问题。
    我们党的中央委员会和苏联政府深信：每一个军人，在伟大的卫国战争年代里光荣地率领苏联军队进行战斗的我们的军官、陆海军将领们必将满意地领会苏联政府关于再次大量裁减苏联武装部队的建议。我们相信，将转业从事非军事工作的军人同志，在和平劳动的岗位上也将光荣地为自己的人民服务，像他们过去和目前在光荣的苏联武装部队里为人民服务一样。
    我们对这些在苏联武装部队中忠实忘我地服务的同志们表示深深的感激。
    请允许我衷心祝贺同志们在新的岗位上取得辉煌的成就——同样忠实忘我地为工人阶级的利益、为苏联劳动人民的利益服务，以取得共产主义的胜利。　
      和平共处的必要性
    是由生活本身决定的
    代表同志们！我们在重要国际谈判的前夕提出了再次裁减我们武装
  部队的建议，这次谈判中将要讨论苏联提出的在四年内全面彻底裁军的
  计划。现在大家看到，我们不只是提出了全面彻底裁军的计划，而且在
  单方面地开始实现这个计划中所规定的一些重大措施，即在采取促使就裁军问题达成协议的深远步骤。我们并不空口说白话，而是以实际行动来支持我们的建议。
    在国际实践中常常有这样的事情：有人提出一种建议时指望这种建议肯定将被对方拒绝。这种诡诈的方法对苏联和一切社会主义国家是格格不入的。我们的全面彻底裁军计划中所规定的东西，我们准备从达成相应的协议那天起，就一贯地、彻底地加以实现。此外，我们正在事先创造一些能大大促进达成这一协议、而且似乎预料到可以实现的条件。北大西洋公约组织成员国的政府能不能说他们也采取了这种行动呢？很遗憾，现在无论如何还不能这样说。
    我们要进一步裁减自己的武装部队并真诚希望其他国家也走这条路。
    可能会产生这样的问题：过去为了同西方国家作出在相互的基础上裁减军队的一致决定，已经撕毁了不少的方案，可是为什么现在我们自愿单方面裁减自己的武装部队呢？我们这样做是不是让步，我们这种步骤会不会被认为是放弃了过去的要求？
    代表同志们，我应当表示，我们也注意到了这样解释我们的决定的可能性。但是，政府认为单方面裁减我们的武装部队是适时的——这就是原因所在。
    正像我已经提到的，苏联的全面彻底裁军计划是去年9月间向联合国提出的。联合国大会通过决议把我们这个建议以及其他国家在裁军方面的建议提交十国委员会审查。
    苏联提出建议以后已经过了四个月了，而十国裁军委员会还没有着手工作，尽管它的五个成员国——苏联、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国和保加利亚人民共和国曾多次声明，它们准备立刻执行联合国大会第十四次会议的这一决议。当时曾经同西方国家达成协议，十国裁军委员会将在今年年初着手工作。后来这个日期又改到2月，当然，这不是我们提出来的，而现在对方又建议把委员会的召开日期推迟到3月15日，对这又不得不同意。
    请大家正确了解我的意思。我不想对十国裁军委员会本身或者对它即将从事的重要工作说什么坏话。苏联政府非常希望这个委员会的工作尽可能地富有成果，并且能顺利地担负起它所面临的重大任务。但是，在战后年代里，已经积累了不少裁军谈判的经验，如果我们现在不说出自己的忧虑，我们就不能算彻底的真诚。如果这种可悲的经验也被运用在重新建立的讨论裁军问题的机构——十国裁军委员会中，那末谈判的过程将拖得很长很长，或许，在会上要喝掉很多水，谈判者才能在走向裁军协议的道路上有所进展。如果以到目前为止的那种速度来讨论停止军备竞赛的问题，来解决，例如，关于死人埋葬问题，那末尸体早已烂掉了，将没有什么可以埋葬。
    苏联的裁军建议未必会遭到正面反对，因为今天世界局势不是这样。但是大家知道，在西方外交家的武库中还有这样一些法宝，如成立各式各样的委员会和小组委员会，提出种种报告和分析，无休止地争论一些措词以及吵嘴。不能排除这样一种情况，即裁军的反对者可能玩弄所有这些伎俩，以阻挠通过建设性的决议。我们希望，根本不发生这类事情，好使谈判能诚挚而有成效地进行。
    但是，应该考虑到，谈判仍然会不如人意地倒退，那时，我们在谈判中就不得不违背初衷，而面临一个局面：必须把我们的军队保持在一个按实际说来，我们的国防利益并不需要的人数的水平上。在谈判中，我们当然一定会提出裁减武装力量和军备的对等原则作为条件。而我们的谈判对方如果拖延达成协议，就使我们没有可能在对等原则的基础上解决这一问题。因此，在没有说服我们的谈判对方同意彼此都裁减之前，为了维护我们国家的威望，我们的军队应该保持现有的人数。
    谁会因此而受到损失呢？因此而受到损失的是我们苏维埃国家，是我国人民，因为这会白白花掉人民的资财。而我们就要继续维持像今天这样多的军队。我们实现单方面裁减苏联武装部队，也就是向全世界表明，而且用具体的事实表明我们的意愿是真诚的，我们渴望同各国人民和平友好相处。
    当然，就是在裁减苏联武装部队人数之后，我们也不会放松同西方国家达成全面彻底裁军协议的努力。我们希望自己和别人都免受战争的威胁，消除那些可能把人类拖入战争的偶然事件，因为在现今条件下爆发的战争必然会成为世界大战。
    我们有充分理由可以说，苏联单方面采取的缓和国际紧张局势的步骤，现在和将来都对国际局势产生重大影响。
    应当认为，西方国家的人民和舆论将加强对北大西洋公约组织中那些想扩充武装部队和军备的集团施加压力。每当资本主义国家的议会中产生增加军事拨款问题时，跟人民接近的议员就可以理直气壮地谈到苏联裁减自己武装部队的榜样。西方任何一个思想健全的、没有侵略意图的人都将会这样议论：为什么在苏联大量裁减自己武装部队的时候，我们却要增加自己的武装部队。当然，很难期待那些始终硬说“苏联军事威胁”的人烂掉舌头。但是，可以完全肯定说，“冷战”卫士们的听众已经大大减少了。
    我们在实现裁减自己武装部队措施的时候，要向西方国家说：让我们达成裁军协议，让我们尽一切努力防止战争，让我们不在增加武装部队和军备方面竞赛，而是在裁减武装部队和销毁作战手段方面竞赛吧。
    苏联、所有社会主义国家相互提供援助，是为了使一些国家的经济提高到更加发达的水平。同时，社会主义国家一贯执行援助经济不发达
  国家的原则。社会主义国家的劳动人民真诚地希望，为自己的自由和独立而斗争的各国人民建立起自己的经济，并坚定地依靠自力更生，在发展经济和提高物质福利方面不依靠富有的资本主义大国的施舍。
    苏联过去和现在一直对其他国家给予力所能及的帮助，我想无需列举我们所帮助的国家和我们在那里参加建设的企业，因为这是一个很长
  的名单。
    裁减武装部队，也就是缩减军费开支，能为我国的经济发展、从而也为扩大对所谓不发达国家的援助创造更好的可能性。
    我们过去和现在都表示，如果达成全面彻底裁军的协议从而腾出大量资金，那么就能用这笔资金大力援助所有经济不发达的国家。
    所有国家——不论它们的内部秩序和在其中占统治地位的社会制度如何——实行和平共处，是今天的基本问题，是国际生活中问题的问题。只有通过裁军来加强的和平共处，才是通向持久和平、使人类避免毁灭性的世界大战的浩劫的康庄大道。不仅广大人民群众，而且许多资本主义国家的政府人士和政界人士也越来越清楚地理解到和平共处的必要性。
    但是也存在着热中于歪曲和平共处概念的人。在那些最顽固的“冷战”信徒中间，有人甚至企图以和平共处来吓唬人民，把和平共处描写成是共产党人的毒计。
    我们已经不止一次地说过，和平共处不是某一个人的臆想，而是现实，它反映了目前世界上存在着两个社会体系——社会主义和资本主义。这两个社会体系之间正在进行经济方面的竞赛，正在进行意识形态的斗争。这种现象本身是合乎规律的，是社会发展的必经阶段。全部问题仅在于，用什么手段解决这个还是那个体系优越的问题——通过和平竞赛还是通过战争搏斗。
    两个体系的争执问题能够、而且应该用和平的手段来解决，不能用武力来解决国和国之间的争执问题。意识形态的斗争、争取人心的斗争，在不同社会制度的国家和平共处的条件下也将继续进行。但是，我们建议不用武力，而是用说服的力量，用良好的榜样来解决各国之间意识形态方面的争执。我们采取再一次裁减武装部队的决定，就是树立符合人类美好理想的好榜样。我们主张每一种社会制度在和平发展过程中显示出自己的优越性，让每个国家的人民自己选择拥护哪一种社会制度。
    和平共处——这意味着意识形态对立的国家应该彼此和平相处，彼此并肩存在、共处。“共处”这个词就是这样来的。如果世界上只有一种意识形态，在所有国家里只有同一种的社会制度，那么，就不会存在敌对的制度了，就根本不会产生我们现在所谈论的那种共处问题了。那时，只是生存，而不是共处了。
    但是，现在世界上的情况是：存在着两个阵营，而两个阵营的社会制度是不相同的。这两个阵营的国家的政策是建立在完全不同的基础之上的。因此，在这种情况下，和平共处的问题，也就是说，如何使世界免遭在本质上敌对的两种体系之间、这两种体系占统治地位的两类国家之间发生军事冲突的灾难这一问题具有极其重要的意义。必须努力使两种制度之间不可避免的斗争变成只是两种意识形态之间的斗争，变成和平竞赛、——或者用资本家更容易理解的言论说——竞争。因此，每一方都将尽可能地向人们显示自己的优越性，但是，应当排除用战争作为解决这种争端的手段。这就是我们共产党人所理解的共处。我们现在和将来都将竭力坚持这种共处，并且我们认为，在现今情况下，如果不故意坚持火箭—核战争的狂妄方针的话，那么共处是必要的和不可避免的。
    现在，西方一些政客试图欺骗和恫吓那些不了解共产主义理论和不理解我们共产主义哲学的无知人们。他们极力使这些人相信，既然，共产党人说自己相信共产主义意识形态的胜利和相信社会主义和共产主义在全世界取得最后胜利，那么，这就意味着，共产党人怀有侵略阴谋，想征服整个世界，指挥全人类等等。这类谬论是恬不知耻的谎话和诽谤，这还用得着证明吗。
    共产主义的敌人歪曲我们的目标，是因为他们害怕社会主义国家爱好和平的政策对各国人民的影响。当然，我们从未讲过我们要征服整个世界或者征服世界的一部分。“征服”是什么意思呢？这就是说，用武力把自己的条件、自己的政治制度、自己的意识形态强加于另一方。但是，这已不是共处，而是干涉他国内政了，这是战争。我们最坚决地反对这种做法。
    我们认为，不能用武力把别国人民所反对的、他们所不喜欢的东西强加于他们。共产党人深信，任何意识形态，包括共产主义意识形态在内，都是不能用武力、用战争、用刺刀来推行的。
    但是，还有事情的另一面，这也是资本主义思想家千方百计地企图加以掩饰的。任何国界都不能阻挡共产主义思想、马克思列宁主义学说的传播，任何军队都不能阻止人类思想的进步，甚至那些受命手持武器防止人民接受共产主义思想的人，往往自己也接受了这种进步思想，从反共的卫士变为资本家所谓的带有共产主义“细菌”的人。
    谁也不能以任何刺刀和监狱、任何暴力来阻止共产主义思想，原因是很简单的：马克思列宁主义是劳动人民根本利益的体现，是真理。共产主义社会是以完全公正、自由、平等和真正尊重人的原则为基础的社会。无论怎样提防，无论怎样欺骗，人们终究会辨清和懂得，什么是谎言，什么是真理，什么是坏，什么是好。我们对共产主义事业必将获得最后胜利的信念正是建立在这个基础上的。共产主义必将胜利，但是，这不意味着社会主义国家占领其他国家。不是的，每一国人民自己会衡量一切事实，当他们正确地理解了马克思列宁主义学说的实质时，他们将自愿地选择更加进步的社会生活方式。
    要想认识清楚什么样的制度更加进步、更加公正是一天比一天容易了。千千万万的人亲眼看到资本主义的灾害，感到这种压在自己背上的压迫制度的全部重负和不合理，时间越长，他们将越清楚地看到这一点，越强烈地感到这一点。
    生活在资本主义国家的人民看到：资本主义——就是少数人过奢侈生活、而劳动人民过困苦的半饥半饱的生活的一种鲜明的对照，就是千百万失业大军流落街头，就是那些尚有工作的人始终对明天没有信心。资本主义国家的劳动人民非常明白，这意味着，生了病而没有钱去医治，没有钱去请医生和买价钱昂贵的药，这意味着，没有机会把自己的孩子送进学校。
    当资本主义国家的人们把自己的生活条件同社会主义国家的生活条件加以比较时，不难猜想，他们会得出怎样的结论，因为社会主义国家的公民早已忘却了所有这些灾难。当他们把资本主义经济发展的缓慢速度同社会主义国家国民经济蓬勃发展加以比较，把帝国主义的“冷战”政策和军备竞赛同社会主义国家的和平外交政策和它们争取裁军的斗争加以比较时，就可以懂得，哪一种社会制度更公正、更进步。
    如果说今天资本主义宣传家们还能用共产主义来吓唬一些不大熟悉情况的人的话，那么可以有把握地说，这完全是暂时的现象。当这些人自己明白事情真象时，他们将为自己现在的迷误感到害臊；不是每一个祖父都敢于对自己的孙子说，他曾经有一段时间反对过共产主义。
    资本主义的某些较有远见的思想家和政治家已经开始认识到，他们所处的和维护的那种社会制度从历史上看必将灭亡。他们害怕这一点，竭力想推迟不可避免的事情的到来，千方百计地掩盖事实，避免说出真象，希望以此来模糊群众的认识。
    例如，愈来愈多的西方国家领导人和政治家发表谈话，号召“援助”经济落后的国家。他们说，要让这些国家里的饿肚子的人吃饱，不然他们要提出自己的权利。当然，讲这种话时，用了宽宏大量、人道等等各种各样的漂亮名词。但是，这实际上反映什么呢？决不是基督教对亲人的博爱，而是垄断资本家的最平常的、利己主义的恐惧感。
    帝国主义者和殖民主义者对他们现在打算如此“慷慨地”给以帮助的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家掠夺了几十年，甚至几百年之久。他们从这些国家攫取了无法计算的财富，存心使那些创造这种财富的人处于贫穷和愚昧之中，残酷地剥削他们。这就是几十个亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家今天贫穷并且属于经济不发达国家之列的原因。这决不是因为它们的土地比其他国家贫瘠或者居民的才能和对劳动的热爱较差，而是因为外国的剥削者攫取了这些国家的劳动和资源，靠它们发了财。结果产生了这样一种情况：在资本主义宗主国，平均一个居民一年大约收入一千至两千美元，而在落后的国家，一个居民只不过一百来美元，有的还要少。
    现在是被掠夺者开始觉悟的时候了，他们开始意识到：是谁掠夺了他们，是谁害他们陷于如此贫困的境地。当他们一提到这点时，就提高了自己的嗓子。正因为如此，殖民主义者开始感觉到，清算的时刻很快就要到来，所以他们企图设法摆脱这种处境。
    当然，苏联和其他社会主义国家的存在和发展，对提高殖民地或过去的殖民地和半殖民地国家的觉悟，起着巨大的作用。社会主义国家的顺利的发展是有目共睹的。这些国家，例如中国和其他一些国家，过去也曾经处于被剥削的和经济落后的国家的地位。而今天，这些国家完全改变了自己的面貌，并在发展经济、文化和建立起新社会的事业中取得了巨大的成就。社会主义国家就这样以实例表明了社会主义作为更合理、更先进的社会制度的优越性。资本家先生们无论如何回避不了这些事实。无论他们如何歪曲我们的马克思列宁主义学说，无论他们如何诅咒我们，各国人民的眼睛是越来越亮。他们看到并且日益相信，只有摆脱剥削者的压迫，他们才能获得真正的自由、和平和幸福。
    正在取代腐朽的资本主义社会的是一种新的、公正的社会，这种社会能为每一个劳动者保证平等条件和一切福利。在这种新社会的大道上开满了自由、平等、富裕和和平的美丽花朵，它的胜利的进军是阻止不住的。历史发展的规律就是这样。

    代表同志们！我受苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的委托向你们阐述了裁减武装部队的新建议。这个建议的实现将是我国对加强世界和平事业的重大贡献。
    苏联人民深信自己的力量，深信自己美好的共产主义的明天。所以我们今后还要大胆地、坚定地、坚决地争取实现裁军和保证和平共处的条件。苏联人将尽一切努力，争取使其他大小国家都走上这条道路。
    苏联始终不渝地沿着建立起共产主义社会的道路前进，今后仍要毫不动摇地捍卫各国人民之间的伟大的和平事业。
    世界和平万岁！　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科14日电）
