A Stroke of Genius
Liǔ Dí

When we joyfully review the achievements of 1959, a brand new, most beautiful, and colorful picture unfolds before our eyes. We seem to see molten steel as red as could be, flowing like the inexhaustible Yangtze River, coal mountains, dark and gleaming, towering into the clouds, and cotton as white as snow, like flowers that never fade and snowflakes that never stop falling. We also seem to smell the fragrance of rice wafting from the south of the Yangtze River, and the intoxicating aroma of soybeans and sorghum coming from both banks of the Yellow River and from the foot of Changbai Mountain. Looking at this scenery, we can't help but feel refreshed and happy, and proud of the great victory of the Great Leap Forward in our country.

The boundless beauty is inexhaustible. My attention is focused on the picture of the great agricultural harvest. This picture says: In 1959, China's agriculture encountered severe natural disasters that were rare in decades, but the total agricultural output value still exceeded the planned target by a large margin, the grain output exceeded that of 1958, and the cotton harvest was even greater. What a peculiar brilliance! It is truly a stroke of genius, dazzling and eye-catching.

In 1959, on the agricultural front, God did give us a lot of trouble. Many areas suffered severe natural disasters, with the disaster-affected area reaching more than 600 million mu nationwide, accounting for more than one-third of the total cultivated area. If such a severe disaster had occurred in the old society, people would have wandered to other places, suffered from hunger and starvation, and would have truly had "no way to go to heaven, no door to enter the earth." Even in the past few years, it would have been unavoidable to suffer damage and reduce production, affecting the lives of some farmers. But today is different. The Chinese people, holding high the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, overcame natural disasters and achieved a bumper harvest. The power of these three magic weapons is extraordinary, and it is much greater than the supernatural powers of God. Now, when we get the fruitful results in our hands, we cannot help but think of how powerful the People's Commune has been in the fight against natural disasters. Speaking of drought, Henan suffered a severe drought with no rain for a hundred days. Speaking of floods, the Pearl River area of Guangdong suffered a particularly severe flood that occurred once in a century. But with the collective strength of the People's Commune, Henan, which had historically been a land of drought, achieved a bumper harvest; and the Dongjiang area, which was flooded, witnessed the miracle of "thousands of new houses rising from the ground, and all industries prospering to eliminate the traces of disaster!" It is hard to believe, but the colorful picture is right in front of us, a realistic scenery that anyone can see clearly.

This colorful picture was painted by the heroic Chinese people. A painter cannot create a beautiful picture without a handy brush. If the Party's General Line for building socialism has given this painter inspiration, then the People's Commune is a magic brush in the hands of the Chinese people. The strength of the Chinese people is enormous, but this enormous strength can only be fully utilized under the leadership of the Party and with the help of certain social organizational forms; productive forces must have certain relations of production in order to achieve a high degree of development. Now we hold the People's Commune, this unparalleled magic brush, and it has painted this picture of infinite joy and a beautiful harvest. I remember a fairy tale about a "magic brush" that could make birds fly and trees come alive when painted, but that was just out of people's imagination. But our magic brush can turn ideals into reality.

That is why, when this rising sun appeared on the land of China, we felt its strong brilliance and infinite vitality. Only a year and a half has passed, and the history of the People's Commune's growth and development is filled with glorious poems. Under the leadership of the Party, China's 600 million people hold a magic brush in their hands and point it to the nationwide mass steelmaking campaign, and then clusters of blast furnaces stand tall all over the mountains and plains. The magic brush points to the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and then agriculture develops rapidly, and commune-run industries spring up everywhere, with fertilizer plants, pesticide plants, machinery plants, indigenous generators, and indigenous railways appearing one after another. The magic brush points to the development of diversified operations, and then agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries are all developed in an all-round way. The magic brush points to vigorously raising pigs, and then the "black god of wealth" comes to the door. The magic brush points to large-scale water conservancy projects, and then the earth-shattering, overturning rivers and seas water conservancy construction surges forward. The power of the People's Commune is so infinite!

A stroke of genius! We hold the magic brush and paint colorful pictures, and we will paint even more brilliant pictures and achieve even more glorious victories!

    妙笔生辉
    柳笛
    当我们欢欣鼓舞地回顾1959年成就的时候，一幅最新最美五彩缤纷的图画就展现在眼前。我们仿佛看见了通红的钢水像不尽的长江滚滚流来，乌闪闪的煤山高耸云际，白皑皑的棉花像开不败的花朵、落不完的雪片；我们也仿佛闻到了江南飘来的一阵阵稻香，从黄河两岸、从长白山下传来的大豆、高粱袭人的香气。看着这般景色，我们不禁心旷神怡，为我国大跃进的伟大胜利感到幸福和骄傲。
    无限美景观不尽。我的注意力落在农业大丰收的图画上。这幅图画上写着：1959年我国农业遇到了几十年来仅有的严重自然灾害，但是农业总产值仍然比计划指标超过很多，粮食产量超过1958年，棉花更是丰收。这是多么奇异的光彩！真是妙笔生辉，灿烂夺目。
    1959年，在农业战线上，老天爷的确给我们增加了不少麻烦。许多地区遭受了严重的自然灾害，全国受灾面积达到六亿多亩，约占全部耕地面积的三分之一以上。这样的严重灾害，如果是在旧社会，人们流落他乡，挨饥受饿不说，而且真的要“上天无路，入地无门”了。就是在前几年，也免不了要受害减产，影响到一部分农民的生活。可是，今天不同。我国人民手中高举着总路线、大跃进、人民公社三件法宝，战胜了自然灾害，取得了特大的丰收。这三件法宝的力量非同小可，比起老天爷的神通不知要大多少倍。如今，当着我们把累累果实拿到手里的时候，不能不想起人民公社在同自然灾害作斗争中发挥了多么强大的威力。说旱灾，像河南发生了百日不雨的严重干旱；说水灾，广东珠江地区遭受了百年一遇的特大洪水。但是有了人民公社集体的力量，历史上出现过赤地千里的河南，取得了大丰收；被洪水淹没的东江地区，出现了“新屋千栋平地起，五业兴旺灾痕灭”的奇迹！说来难以置信，但是，五彩缤纷的图画就在眼前，这是任何人都看得清清楚楚的现实的景色。
    这幅五彩缤纷的图画是由英雄的中国人民挥就的。画家没有得心应手的画笔，就画不出美丽的图画。如果说党的建设社会主义的总路线给了这位画家以神思，那么，人民公社就是中国人民手里的一支神笔。我国人民的力量是巨大的，但这巨大的力量只有在党的领导下，借助一定的社会组织形式才能得到充分的发挥；生产力要有一定的生产关系才能得到高度的发展。如今我们手中拿的是人民公社这支举世无双的神笔，它画出了这幅无限欢乐的丰收美景。记得有一个“神笔”的童话，画鸟鸟能飞，画树树能活，那究竟不过是出于人们的想像。但我们这支神笔却可以把理想变成现实。
    这就是为什么当这初升的太阳从中国的大地上一出现，我们就感受到了它强烈的光辉和无穷的生命力。时间过去刚刚一年半，人民公社成长壮大的历史上载满了光辉的诗篇。我国六亿人民在党的领导下，手持神笔，指向全民大炼钢铁，于是满山遍野的高炉群耸立起来；神笔指向工农业同时并举，于是农业迅速发展，社办工业遍地开花，化肥厂、农药厂、机械厂、土发电机、土铁路相继出现；神笔指向发展多种经营，于是农林牧副渔全面发展；神笔指向大力养猪，于是“黑财神”盈门登户；神笔指向大搞水利，于是震天动地、翻江倒海的水利建设汹涌澎湃。人民公社的力量就是这样无穷无尽！
    妙笔生辉！我们手持神笔画出了五彩缤纷的图画，还要画出更加灿烂的图画，取得更加辉煌的胜利！
