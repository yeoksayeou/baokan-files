Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 26th - According to the "Lao Patriotic News" report, Phay Dang, Vice Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, recently answered questions raised by reporters from this newspaper regarding the dissolution of the Lao National Assembly by the heads of the Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests."

Phay Dang pointed out that, according to the Lao Kingdom's Constitution and current election law, and based on the National Assembly's resolution, the term of this National Assembly should continue until the new National Assembly is elected in early April this year. The powers of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly and all members of parliament should also be maintained until the new National Assembly is elected. However, the reactionary heads of the Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," who are acting as running dogs of U.S. imperialism, exerted military pressure on the King, subverted the re-organized Phoui Sananikone government, seized supreme power through deception, and ordered the dissolution of the National Assembly, declaring the resolutions passed by the National Assembly not long ago invalid.

Phay Dang pointed out that this behavior is a seizure of the King's power, a disregard for national law, and an extremely serious act of militarism that has never occurred in Laos. The heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" are attempting to realize their conspiracy to abolish the parliamentary system, abolish the people's democratic and free rights, and establish a traitorous and harmful militarist system through the above-mentioned blatant illegal actions.

Referring to the Lao Provisional Government established on January 7 this year, Phay Dang pointed out that in the past period, the heads of the Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" abused their right to command the Kingdom's troops, dispatched armored vehicles and troops to surround the Royal Palace and the National Assembly, declared martial law in Vientiane, and forced the reorganized cabinet, which had been recognized by the King and passed by the National Assembly, to resign. They put pressure on the King and established a provisional government in which they controlled important departments such as foreign affairs, national defense, and economic finance. At present, they are still rampaging and acting tyrannically, such as announcing the continuation of martial law from January 13, continuing to persecute the people, and plotting to revise the Constitution and election law in an attempt to gain an advantage in the upcoming general election. They have also violated the foreign policy once announced by Kou Abhay and adopted an unfriendly attitude towards neighboring countries. Therefore, the Lao people must remain vigilant in order to promptly stop and smash the conspiracy of the heads of the Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" and their master, U.S. imperialism. Phay Dang pointed out that the Lao Patriotic Front Party supports the demands of all Lao political parties, people from all walks of life, and the entire people to revoke all orders issued by the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" regarding the dissolution of the National Assembly and the cancellation of the National Assembly's resolutions. The powers of the members of the National Assembly must be immediately restored. The National Assembly should supervise the conduct of the general election in accordance with the provisions of the current Constitution and election law, prevent the militarists leading the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" from abusing their power, thereby realizing a democratic and free general election, and creating conditions for a truly peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 24th - According to a report on January 16 in the "Lao Patriotic News," the organ of the Lao Patriotic Party, the warlord clique of the Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" murdered 318 Lao people in the last five months of 1959.

These victims were subjected to extremely barbaric massacres. For example, on December 11 last year, the reactionaries dispatched their troops to surround the village of Pa Lang in Phong Saly Province, opening fire on the people and killing 21 people in one go. In Khouane in this province, they burned 24 people alive; in Na Hoi, Vientiane Province, they burned an old woman alive; in Phieng Niu, Luang Prabang Province, they put some arrested people into burlap sacks and threw them into the river.

They also burned down many villages during "mopping-up" operations. Since July last year, 195 villages and urban areas have been destroyed.

    老挝爱国战线党副主席费当声明
    谴责老挝军阀头目非法解散国民议会
    号召人民警惕美国及其走狗的阴谋
    新华社河内26日电　据“老挝爱国报”报道，老挝爱国战线党副主席费当最近就老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们解散老挝国民议会一事回答了这家报纸记者提出的问题。
    费当指出，根据老挝王国宪法和现行选举法，并根据国民议会的决议，这一届国民议会的任期要延续到今年4月初选出新的国民议会时为止。国民议会常务委员会和所有议员的职权也要一直保持到选出新的国民议会时为止。但是，充当美帝国主义走狗的老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的反动头目们却向国王施加军事压力，颠复了重新改组的培·萨纳尼空政府，骗取了最高权柄，并下令解散国民议会，宣布国民议会不久以前通过的决议无效。
    费当指出，这种行为是强夺国王权力、无视国法、在老挝从未出现过的极端严重的军国主义行为。“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们企图通过上述明目张胆的违法行为来实现他们取消议会制度、取消人民的民主自由权利并建立卖国殃民的军国主义制度的阴谋。
    费当在谈到今年1月7日成立的老挝临时政府时指出，过去期间，老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们滥用指挥王国部队的权利，出动装甲车和部队包围王宫和国会，宣布在万象戒严，迫使已经得到国王承认和国会通过的改组了的内阁辞职。他们向国王施加压力，成立了由他们掌握外交、国防、经济财政等重要部门的临时政府。目前，他们仍然横行霸道，如宣布从1月13日起继续实行戒严，继续迫害人民，阴谋修改宪法和选举法，企图在即将举行的大选中夺取优势。他们还违反贡·阿贝曾经宣布的外交政策，对邻国采取了不友好的态度。因此，老挝人民仍须提高警惕，以便及时制止并粉碎老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们和他们的主子美帝国主义的阴谋。费当指出，老挝爱国线战党赞成老挝各政党、各界人士和全体人民要求撤销“保卫国家利益委员会”有关解散国民议会和取消国民议会决议的一切命令的主张。必须马上恢复国民议会议员的职权。使国民议会根据现行宪法和选举法的规定来监督大选的进行，制止领导“保卫国家利益委员会”的军国主义分子滥用权利，从而实现民主自由的大选，并为实现真正的和平中立、独立民主、统一和繁荣的老挝创造条件。
    新华社河内24日电　据老挝爱国党机关报“老挝爱国报”1月16日报道，老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的军阀集团分子在1959年最后五个月杀害了三百十八名老挝人。
    这些受害者遭到极端野蛮的屠杀。譬如，去年12月11日反动派派遣他们的军队去包围丰沙里省的巴朗村，向人民开枪扫射，一次杀死了二十一人。他们在这个省的会然把二十四人活活烧死；在万象省的纳会，把一个老大娘活活烧死；在琅勃拉邦省的飞纽，把一些被逮捕的人装到麻布袋里，把他们扔到河里去。
    他们还在“扫荡”战中烧毁了许多村落。从去年7月以来，已有一百九十五个村落和市区被毁坏。
