Xinhua News Agency, Xining, January 18th: The Suji Brigade Amateur Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Middle School of Sujitan Commune in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, Qinghai Province, flexibly and diversely carries out teaching activities in combination with production, powerfully promoting local animal husbandry production.

This amateur animal husbandry and veterinary middle school was established in May 1957. Over the past two years, it has gradually developed, and now has more than 390 students, nearly four times more than when it was founded, half of whom are women. The curriculum of the training class has gradually deepened and improved. One hundred and eighty students have been promoted to the intermediate class to further study animal husbandry and veterinary science theory and various drug manufacturing techniques.

All the herders of this brigade have enrolled in the school. Among them, 57 have become "four-in-one" personnel, namely: herders, veterinarians, lambing assistants, and inseminators. They can not only graze livestock well, but also identify and prevent more than 20 kinds of animal diseases in cattle, sheep, pigs, and other livestock. They can perform subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous injections on livestock, and have mastered technologies such as lambing and rearing, insemination, and manufacturing chlortetracycline feed.

Because the school has cultivated technical personnel, a veterinary network has been formed on Sujitan: the commune has a veterinary station, the brigade has a veterinary team, the team has a veterinary group, and the livestock herds have epidemic prevention personnel, ensuring that major livestock diseases do not leave the team and minor diseases do not leave the herd. Last year, the brigade treated and prevented various livestock diseases a total of 258,000 head (times), crossbred and improved more than 4,000 sheep, more than 200 horses, and more than 200 cattle. Various livestock diseases that used to be prevalent in this area are now basically under control, playing an important role in promoting the development of local animal husbandry production.

The growth of the Suji Brigade Amateur Middle School is the result of implementing the policy of "education serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor" under the leadership of the Party. In 1957, when the Sujitan area initially established agricultural production cooperatives, there were only seven veterinarians in the entire area, and grazing methods were relatively backward. In order to develop animal husbandry production, the CCP Sujitan District Committee, based on the fact that the herders had already settled down and had undergone literacy studies, resolutely established the amateur animal husbandry and veterinary middle school, setting up three courses: politics, animal husbandry, and veterinary medicine. For more than two years, the Party committee has always attached importance to the consolidation and development of this school. Each time the commune arranged production tasks, it uniformly arranged study tasks, arranged study time for commune members, and helped the school solve problems such as teachers and classrooms, so that teaching activities could be carried out smoothly.

Under the leadership of the Party organization, the teaching content and teaching methods of this amateur middle school also adhered to the principles of giving prominence to politics and closely integrating with production. The commune Party committee secretary lectured on political classes, and experienced herders and cadres who understood animal husbandry and veterinary technology lectured on technical classes. During the winter lambing season, they taught lambing and rearing techniques; during the prevention and control of livestock diseases, they taught veterinary epidemic prevention techniques. At the same time, they compiled effective grazing and livestock disease treatment methods from the masses into teaching materials for the students to learn. In terms of teaching methods, they implemented less learning during busy times and more learning during slack times; during the summer and autumn, when students were dispersed for grazing, they divided into many small classes to teach, and during the winter and spring, after the herders returned to their settlements, they concentrated on studying.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 18th: The Tianjin Chemical Power Source Research Institute gives full play to the potential of its internal technical forces, and holds technical training classes and technical schools to train technical forces for the institute and other units.

The Chemical Power Source Research Institute felt that there were insufficient cadres when it was first established. In the past two years, with the continuous increase in research tasks, the lack of technical strength has become a prominent problem in the work. To this end, the institute decided to run its own school. The secretary of the Party branch took the lead, with the participation of the heads of the administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, and the chief engineer. An education committee was established, and full-time cadres were drawn to establish a teaching and research section, and short-term training classes and secondary technical schools were opened. Scientific research was carried out on the one hand, and technical cadres were trained on the other.

The research institute's training class accepts workers and cadres from inside and outside the factory, for a period of nine months, divided into three stages of teaching: the first stage is to study culture and junior high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry courses; the second stage is to study part of the senior high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry courses, and combine to teach some basic knowledge of chemical power source specialties; the third stage is to concentrate on studying chemical power source professional knowledge. The technical school enrolls students with junior high school graduation level, has two and a half years of time to study basic courses; one and a half years of time to systematically study chemical power source professional knowledge, including theoretical electrochemistry, chemical power source technology, industrial chemistry, applied electrochemistry, industrial analysis, etc.

In solving the problem of teachers for training classes and technical schools, the research institute gave full play to the potential of the original technical forces. All the chief engineers and engineers of the institute served as part-time teachers; at the same time, the "three combinations" teaching method was adopted, organizing engineers to teach advanced theoretical courses, technicians to teach general technical knowledge, and veteran workers to guide practice and production. The teaching content of each part-time teacher is generally combined with their own expertise and specialty, and a decentralized teaching method is adopted. In this way, teaching is closely combined with the teacher's own scientific research work, which not only does not increase the burden on technical personnel, but also makes the course easier to teach in depth.

Since the research institute started running schools in September of the year before last, a total of 53 students have graduated from the worker training class, of which 13 have been transferred to work in other production units. Forty people have participated in the research work of this institute. This summer vacation, more than 70 students from the technical school will also graduate. After these students graduate, they will greatly increase the technical strength of the research institute.

    培养畜牧干部　发展畜牧事业
    青海省苏吉滩公社苏吉大队大办业余畜牧兽医中学
    天津化学电源研究所举办中等技术学校
    新华社西宁18日电　青海省海北藏族自治州门源回族自治县苏吉滩公社苏吉大队业余畜牧兽医中学，结合生产灵活多样地开展教学活动，有力地推动了当地畜牧业生产。
    这所业余畜牧兽医中学是1957年5月建立的，两年来逐步发展，现在学员人数达三百九十多人，比创办时增加了近四倍，其中一半是妇女。训练班的课程内容由浅入深，逐步提高，有一百八十个学员已升入了中级班，进一步学习畜牧兽医科学理论和各种药品制造。
    这个大队的放牧员全部入了学。他们之中已有五十七人达到一身兼“四员”，即：放牧员、兽医员、接羔员、配种员；既能很好地放牧牲畜，又能识别和防治牛、羊、猪等家畜的二十多种畜病，能作牲畜的皮下、肌肉、静脉注射，掌握了接羔育幼、配种、制造金霉素饲料等技术。
    由于学校培养了训练技术力量，目前苏吉滩上已经组成了一个兽医网：公社有兽医站，大队有兽医队，小队有兽医组，畜群有防疫员；作到牲畜大病不出队，小病不出群。去年，大队共防治各种牲畜二十五万八千多头（次），杂交改良绵羊四千多只，马二百多匹，牛二百多头。从前在这个地区流行的各种畜病，现在基本上被控制，对促进当地牧业生产的发展起了重要作用。
    苏吉大队业余中学的成长，是在党的领导下，贯彻了“教育为工人阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”方针的结果。1957年苏吉滩地区初建牧业生产合作社时，全区只有七个兽医，放牧方法也比较落后。为了发展畜牧业生产，中共苏吉滩区委根据当时牧民已经实现定居并经过了扫盲学习等情况，坚决创办了畜牧兽医业余中学，设了政治、畜牧、兽医三门课程。两年多来，党委一直重视这个学校的巩固和发展，公社每次布置生产任务时，都统一地布置了学习任务，给社员安排学习时间，帮助学校解决教师、教室等问题，使教学活动顺利进行。
    在党组织领导下，这所业余中学的教学内容和教学方法也坚持了政治挂帅、密切结合生产的原则。由公社党委书记讲政治课，有经验的放牧员和懂得畜牧、兽医技术的干部讲技术课。冬季产羔时教接羔育幼，防治畜病时教兽疫防治技术；同时，把群众中行之有效的放牧、畜病治疗方法整理成教材给学员讲授。在教学方法上，实行忙时少学，闲时多学；夏秋季学员分散放牧时分成许多小班上课，冬春季牧民回到定居点后就集中学习。
    据新华社天津18日电　天津化学电源研究所充分发挥所内技术力量的潜力，举办技术训练班和技术学校，为本所和其他单位培养了技术力量。
    化学电源研究所在初成立时就感到干部不足。近两年来，随着研究任务的不断增加，缺乏技术力量就成为工作中的突出问题。为此，这个所决定自办学校。由党总支书记挂帅，行政、工会、共青团负责人和总工程师参加，成立了教育委员会；并抽出专职干部，建立了教导处，开办了短期训练班和中等技术学校。一边进行科学研究，一边培养技术干部。
    研究所训练班吸收厂内外工人、干部参加，为期九个月，分三个阶段教学：第一阶段学习文化和初中数、理、化课程；第二阶段学习部分高中数、理、化课程，并结合讲授一些化学电源专业的基本知识；第三阶段集中学习化学电源专业知识。技术学校吸收初中毕业程度的学员参加，有二年半的时间学习基础课程；一年半的时间系统地学习化学电源专业知识，包括理论电化学、化学电源工艺学、工业化学、实用电化学、工业分析等。
    在解决训练班和技术学校的师资问题上，这个研究所充分发挥了原有技术力量的潜力。全所几位总工程师和工程师全部担任了兼职教员；同时，采取“三结合”的教课方法，组织工程师教高深理论课，技术员讲一般技术知识，老工人指导实习和生产。各兼职教师的教学内容，一般都结合自己的专长、专业，采取分散授课的方式。这样，就使教学与教师本身的科学研究工作紧密结合起来，既不增加技术人员负担；又使课程易于讲深教好。
    这个研究所在前年9月办学以来，从工人训练班毕业的学员共五十三人，其中有十三人已经调派到其他生产单位工作。有四十人参加了本所的研究工作。今年暑假，技术学校的七十多名学员也将毕业，这批学员毕业后，将大大增加研究所的技术力量。
