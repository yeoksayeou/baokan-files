    Kishi Nobusuke and the Japanese Newspapers
    Chi Bei'ou
    Kishi Nobusuke said at a private gathering of Japanese residents in Honolulu on the 16th: Japanese newspapers are "different from the American 'New York Times' and other good newspapers. Japanese newspapers are not to be believed." When he reads Japanese newspapers, he only looks at the "sports section."

    The Japanese moon is not as good as the American one,
    The "Asahi Shimbun" is not as good as the "New York Times."
    Kishi Nobusuke thinks Japanese newspapers are not worth reading,
    Almost all of them are nonsense.
    He only flips through the sports news every day,
    To see how much the Japanese teams lost to the American teams.

    Kishi Nobusuke's impolite remarks caused an uproar,
    Japanese newspapers have condemned him for betraying the country and forfeiting its sovereignty.
    Some said that he forgot Tokyo when he arrived in Washington,
    Some said that he was completely a foreign slave.
    He is busy saying "Arigato" (Note 1) to his American masters,
    And doesn't care if you scold him "Baga Yarou" (Note 2).
        Note 1: Japanese for thank you.
        Note 2: Japanese curse word.

    岸信介和日本报纸
    池北偶
    岸信介16日在檀香山的一次日侨私人集会上说：日本报纸“同美国的‘纽约时报’和其它好报纸不同，日本的报纸是不能令人相信的。”他看日本报纸时只看看“体育运动栏”。
    日本的月亮没美国的好，
    “朝日新闻”比不上“纽约时报”。
    岸信介认为日本报纸不值一读，
    差不多所有都是胡说八道。
    他每天只翻一翻体育新闻，
    看看日本球队输给了美国球队多少。
    岸信介出言不逊引起轩然大波，
    日本报纸纷纷斥责他丧权辱国。
    有的说他到了华盛顿忘了东京，
    有的说他完全是洋奴一个。
    他正在忙于向美国主人说“阿里嘎多”，（注一）
    才不管你们骂他“八格牙鲁”。（注二）
        注一　日语多谢之意。
        注二　日语骂人的话。
