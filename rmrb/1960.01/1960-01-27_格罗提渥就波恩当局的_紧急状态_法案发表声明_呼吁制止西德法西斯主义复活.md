Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, via TASS: According to a report by the German News Agency, German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl issued a statement regarding the Adenauer government's decision to submit its drafted state of emergency bill to the Bonn Federal Parliament for review. Grotewohl said that this action by the Bonn authorities is a vain attempt to create a legal basis for suppressing the West German people's growing resistance movement against atomic armament and against the revival of fascism, militarism, and revanchist policies.

Grotewohl, referring to the West German actions of suppressing the German Communist Party and other democratic organizations, said that the Bonn authorities now want to use the state of emergency law to exclude all forces from social life that are unwilling to fully support Adenauer's "Cold War" and policies of preparing for civil war. Grotewohl said that the Bonn government's decision is a conscious blow to resolving the German people's national question.

Grotewohl believes that the state of emergency bill is a rehash of the Weimar Constitution's notorious Article 48, which paralyzed democratic forces at the time and opened the way for fascism and militarism. This action is bound to arouse the vigilance of democratic forces and inspire them to fight to prevent this situation from reoccurring.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, via TASS: "Labor News" published a commentary on the "state of emergency" bill proposed by West German Interior Minister Schröder, pointing out that officials stubbornly claim that this new reactionary legislative measure is "primarily" to ensure security in the Federal Republic of Germany in the event of "external military aggression." The very way this question is framed clearly illustrates what Bonn is preparing for and in what direction Bonn's thinking is going at a time when all of humanity is rejoicing at the increasing hopes for mutual understanding, disarmament, and the strengthening of peace. But in fact, those in the Rhine Group who are paving the way for themselves towards unlimited power in a "state of emergency" are by no means bound to wait for an "attack."

According to the bill, if a majority of the Federal Parliament believes that there is an "imminent threat of attack" or that "internal political struggles" are occurring, the ruling group can effectively obtain emergency powers. The full text of the published bill and the comments on it leave no doubt that its purpose is, first and foremost, to establish far-reaching legislative guarantees for the rule of reactionary and militaristic forces. This law gives these forces a realistic possibility to eliminate all democratic freedoms, violently suppress all opposition forces, and crush the workers' movement and trade unions.

"Labor News" concluded by saying that the Social Democratic Party's rejection of this bill does not diminish the threat. The ruling group will use roundabout methods to try to pass the "state of emergency" law.

### 格罗提渥就波恩当局的“紧急状态”法案发表声明  呼吁制止西德法西斯主义复活

    格罗提渥就波恩当局的“紧急状态”法案发表声明
    呼吁制止西德法西斯主义复活
    新华社讯　据塔斯社柏林讯：据德意志通讯社报道，德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥就阿登纳政府决定把它起草的紧急状态法案提交波恩联邦议院审查一事发表声明说，波恩当局的这一行动是妄想为镇压西德人民日益增长的反对原子武装，反对复活法西斯主义、军国主义和复仇主义政策的抵抗运动制造法律根据。
    格罗提渥在谈到西德镇压德国共产党以及其他民主组织的行动后说，波恩当局现在又想借助紧急状态法把一切不愿意完全支持阿登纳奉行的“冷战”和准备内战的政策的力量从社会生活中排挤出去。格罗提渥说，波恩政府的决定是对解决德国人民的民族问题的有意识的打击。
    格罗提渥认为紧急状态法案是魏玛宪法恶名昭著的第四十八条的再版，魏玛宪法当时曾使民主力量陷于瘫痪，并为法西斯主义和军国主义开辟了道路。这一行动必然引起民主力量的警惕，并为制止这一情况的重新出现而奋斗。
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科电：“劳动报”对西德内政部长施罗德提出的“紧急状态”法案发表评论，指出，官方硬说，这个新的反动立法措施“首先”是为了在德意志联邦共和国在遭到“外部军事侵犯”时保障安全。这个问题提法本身已足够明显地说明，波恩在准备干什么，当全人类都为互相谅解、裁军和加强和平的希望日益增加而感到喜悦的时候，波恩的思想是朝什么方向走的。但是，事实上，那些在为自己开辟通向“紧急状态”的无限全权之路的来因集团，决没有被约束一定要等到“进攻”。
    据法案规定，如果联邦议院的大多数认为有遭到“进攻的直接威胁”或发生“内部政治斗争”时，统治集团实际上可以获得紧急全权。已公布的法案全文和对它的评论使人毫不怀疑，其目的首先是为反动和军国主义势力的统治建立目的深远的立法保障。这项法律使这些势力有现实的可能来消除一切民主自由，用暴力镇压一切反对力量，打垮工人运动和工会。
    “劳动报”最后说，社会民主党拒绝这项法案，但这并不减少威胁。统治集团会用迂回的办法来设法通过“紧急状态”法的。
