    Wooden Hand-Operated Water Pump Works Well
    Workers at the Qingxi Coal Mine in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, used bamboo and wood to make a hand-operated water pump. This pump is operated by two people and can drain four to five tons of water per hour, with a pumping height of fifteen to twenty meters. If operated by four people, the pumping height can reach about twenty-five meters. This pump is easy to manufacture; except for the piston rod and screws, it is entirely made of wood and bamboo. An average carpenter can make one in four workdays.
    Double-Speed Wooden Fan Delivers Large Air Volume
    Workers at the Yunding Coal Mine in Longchang County, Sichuan Province, solved the ventilation problem using indigenous methods, creating a double-person foot-pedaled, double-speed wooden fan. Except for the eight wheel blades, which are made of iron, the entire fan is made of wood. Driven by two people pedaling, and after being accelerated twice, the air volume can reach 145 cubic meters per minute, which is thirteen times more than that of the old-fashioned winnowing fan. The use of this fan at the Yunding Coal Mine allows each underground worker to receive one cubic meter of fresh air per minute.

    木制手压水泵效果好
    江西省萍乡县清溪煤矿职工，利用竹筒、木材制成手压水泵。这种水泵由两人操作，每小时的排水量可达到四至五吨，扬水高度达十五至二十米，如果四人操作，扬水高度还可达到二十五米左右。这种水泵制造方便，除活塞杆和螺丝外，全部是用木材、竹子做的。一个普通木工用四个工作日就可以制成一部。
    双变速木风机风量大
    四川省隆昌县云顶煤矿职工，用土办法解决通风问题，创造出双人脚踩双变速木风机。这种风机除八片轮叶是铁制的外，全部都是用木料做的。用两人脚踩带动，经过两次加速，每分钟风量可以达到一百四十五立方米，比旧式的风簸提高风量十三倍。云顶煤矿采用这种风机，使井下工人每人每分钟可以得到一立方米的新鲜空气。
