Xinhua News Agency, January 13th - Xu Xuehui, who heroically fought against the Kuomintang armed bandits on the Yunnan border to protect state property, accepted the invitation of A.A. Lomanov, director of the Chita Orthopedic Equipment Factory in the Soviet Union, to install artificial hands for her. She departed from Beijing by train at 12:40 noon today for Chita.

The welcoming crowd surrounded Xu Xuehui at the station, presented her with flowers, and wished her a safe journey. Xu Xuehui bid farewell to the people with a smile, saying, "Comrade Lomanov's concern for me embodies the great proletarian internationalist friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. When I have my new hands installed in the future, I will definitely work even harder for the Party and the people in order to repay Comrade Lomanov and the Soviet people for their concern for me."

    徐学惠去苏联安装假手
    据新华社13日讯　在云南边境英勇地同国民党武装残匪搏斗、保卫国家财产的徐学惠，应苏联赤塔整形器材厂厂长阿·阿·洛玛诺夫给她安装假手的邀请，在今天中午十二点四十分由北京乘火车前往赤塔。
    欢送的人群在车站上围着徐学惠，把鲜花赠给她，并预祝她一路平安。徐学惠欢笑着向人们告别，她说：“洛玛诺夫同志对我的关怀，体现了中苏两国人民伟大的无产阶级的国际主义友谊。当我将来安上新的双手以后，我一定要更好地为党为人民工作，以此来回答洛玛诺夫同志和苏联人民对我的关怀。”
