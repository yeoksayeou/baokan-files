Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 24th. The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today entitled "The Great Victory of the General Line of the Communist Party of China," hailing the victory of the Chinese people's continued Great Leap Forward in 1959. The commentary said: Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, the great Chinese people have continued to leap forward in socialist construction and have achieved brilliant successes. The completion of the main product targets of the Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule by the Chinese people is a remarkable achievement. It said, "This is the victory of the Chinese people, the victory of socialism, and the victory of Marxism-Leninism." It pointed out, "Such a huge rate of economic development is unimaginable in any capitalist country."

The commentary said: "All these achievements powerfully demonstrate that the general line of the Communist Party of China of 'going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results' profoundly reflects the objective laws of China's economic development, and also concentrates the will and desire of the Chinese people to build a motherland with modern industry and modern agriculture as soon as possible." The commentary said: "The summary of the victory in 1959 once again proves the great vitality of Marxism-Leninism and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, especially the correctness of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and its great mobilization significance."

The commentary pointed out that the frantic slander and defamation by the U.S. imperialists are futile. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have completed the main product targets of the Second Five-Year Plan in two years. In particular, 500 million Chinese peasants have established and consolidated people's communes with great determination and wisdom. The commentary said: "This great achievement of the Chinese people is a decisive blow to the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression in the Far East."

The commentary also said that the summary of the victory in 1959 shows that the 650 million Chinese people are more united than ever around the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and are advancing bravely with confidence. This brilliant summary shows that the Chinese people will launch a more comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1960. The commentary said: "The Korean people extend warm congratulations to the Chinese people for their brilliant achievements. We, the Korean people, are as happy and encouraged by the achievements of the Chinese people as if they were our own." The commentary said: "The Korean people wish the Chinese people greater victories and achievements in socialist construction."

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”欢呼我国去年大跃进的胜利
    总路线反映了中国人民的愿望
    新华社平壤24日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表题为“中国共产党的总路线的伟大胜利”的评论，欢呼中国人民1959年继续大跃进的胜利。评论说：伟大的中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，在社会主义建设中继续不断地跃进，取得了辉煌的成就。中国人民提前三年完成五年计划的主要产品指标是一个惊人的成就。它说，“这是中国人民的胜利，是社会主义的胜利，也是马克思列宁主义的胜利。”它指出，“这样巨大的经济发展速度是任何一个资本主义国家所无法想像的。”
    评论说：“这一切成就有力地说明，中国共产党的‘鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义’的总路线深刻地反映了中国经济发展的客观规律，也集中地反映了中国人民要求早日建成有现代工业、现代农业的祖国的意志和愿望。”评论说：“1959年的胜利的总结又一次证明了马克思列宁主义的伟大生命力和社会主义制度的无比优越，特别是证明了中国共产党八届八中全会决议的正确性和它的巨大动员意义。”
    评论指出，美帝国主义者的疯狂的中伤和诽谤是徒劳的。中国人民在中国共产党的正确领导下，在两年内完成了第二个五年计划的主要产品指标，特别是五亿中国农民以伟大的决心和智慧成立和巩固了人民公社。评论说：“中国人民这一伟大成就是对美帝国主义者侵略远东政策的决定性的打击。”
    评论还说，1959年胜利的总结说明，六亿五千万中国人民更加钢铁般地团结在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的周围，满怀信心地勇敢前进。这个光辉的总结说明，中国人民在1960年将掀起更全面的大跃进。评论说：“朝鲜人民向取得这样辉煌成就的中国人民致以热烈的祝贺。我们朝鲜人民把中国人民取得的成就当作自己的成就一样而感到欢欣鼓舞。”评论说：“朝鲜人民预祝中国人民在社会主义建设中取得更大的胜利和成就。”
