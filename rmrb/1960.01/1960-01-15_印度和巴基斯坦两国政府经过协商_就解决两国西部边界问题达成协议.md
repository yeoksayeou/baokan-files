Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 11th: A joint communiqué on the settlement of the western border issues between India and Pakistan was released simultaneously in Delhi and Rawalpindi on January 11th. The communiqué stated that there were five disputed areas on the western border between the two countries, and four of them "have been resolved in a spirit of mutual compromise" during this negotiation. The communiqué said, "Pakistan relinquishes its claim to Chakladhe, while India relinquishes its claim to the three villages of Hussainiwala, Rakh Hardit Singh, and Pathanke." Regarding some water conservancy projects in Hussainiwala, it was decided that the boundary between Ferozepore District (India) and Lahore District (West Pakistan) would serve as the border. A settlement was also reached on the Suleimanke Headworks, with an agreement on adjusting the county boundary. However, regarding the Kutch-Sindh border dispute, the communiqué stated that "the two countries agreed to further collect materials related to the Kutch-Sindh border dispute and will hold discussions in the future to reach a solution to this dispute."

The communiqué stated that the two countries also reached an agreement on the "Basic Rules" implemented on the West Pakistan-India border. "As far as the demarcation of the border between West Pakistan and (Indian) Punjab is concerned, both parties decided that priority should be given to this work, which should be completed by the end of April 1960. The two sides agreed that the return of areas mutually occupied by each other in this section will be completed by October 15, 1960."

Since the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, the border disputes between the two countries in the east and west had not been resolved. At that time, the boundary was drawn by a ruling made by a Briton named Radcliffe, and later supplemented by a Briton named Bagge. However, due to different interpretations of the ruling by both parties, disputes arose, and there were also several armed conflicts. Last October, the two countries held negotiations in Delhi and Dhaka (East Pakistan) respectively on the border issues between India and East Pakistan and issued a joint communiqué on resolving the eastern border issues and a "Basic Rule." In addition to specific provisions for demarcating the eastern border, this "Basic Rule" also stipulated measures to avoid border conflicts, including the establishment of a demilitarized zone of 150 yards wide on both sides of the border.

This time, the two sides also issued a similar "Basic Rule" for the West Pakistan-India border, which stipulated the regulations that the security forces of both sides should follow to avoid any unfortunate incidents and the resulting tensions before a final border decision is made and the territories occupied by the other party are returned to their original owners.

The "Basic Rule" stipulates that "Neither party shall station any permanent or temporary border security forces or any other armed personnel within 150 yards on either side of this actual boundary, nor shall any new forward pickets or observation posts be established within this zone." Existing posts and observation posts may be retained, but their lists must be provided to the other party. Except for the fortifications mentioned in the above list, the fortifications in this 300-yard zone must be demolished or filled in before March 15 this year.

The ministerial-level talks between the two countries on the western border issue were held from January 4th to 11th in Lahore and Rawalpindi in Pakistan and Delhi in India. The head of the Indian delegation was Minister of Steel, Mines, and Fuel Singh, and the head of the Pakistani delegation was Lieutenant General Sheikh, Minister of Interior and Police Intelligence.

    印度和巴基斯坦两国政府经过协商
    就解决两国西部边界问题达成协议
    新华社新德里11日电　印度和巴基斯坦关于解决两国西部边界问题的联合公报11日在德里和拉瓦尔品第两处同时发表。公报说，两国在西部边界共有五个地区有争执，在这次谈判中有四处“已经本着互相和解的精神得到解决”。公报说，“巴基斯坦放弃它对恰克拉德克的主权要求，而印度放弃它对特萨贾马贾、拉克哈迪特辛格和帕坦克三个村庄的主权要求。关于侯赛尼瓦拉的一些水利工程，决定以费罗吉波尔县（印度）和拉合尔县（西巴基斯坦）之间的县界作为边界。对于苏洛曼基水利工程也得到了解决，达成了关于调整县界的协议。”但是，关于喀齐—信德边界纠纷，公报说，“两国同意进一步收集有关喀齐—信德边界争执的材料，并将在以后举行讨论，以便达成解决这个争执的办法。”
    公报说，两国还就西巴基斯坦—印度边界上实施的“基本条规”达成了协议。“就划定西巴基斯坦和（印度）旁遮普之间的边界问题而言，双方决定应该优先注意这项工作，这一工作应在1960年4月底完成。双方同意，归还这一地段内互相为对方占有的地区的工作将在1960年10月15日完成。”
    自从1947年印度和巴基斯坦分治以来，两国东部和西部边界纠纷过去一直没有解决。当时边界是由一个名叫拉克里夫的英国人的裁决来划定的，后来又有一个名叫巴格的英国人作了补充裁决。但是由于双方对裁决的解释不同，于是发生了纠纷，而且还多次发生武装冲突。去年10月间，两国先后在德里和达卡（东巴基斯坦）两地就印度和东巴基斯坦的边界问题举行谈判，并且发表了解决东部边界问题的联合公报和一项“基本条规”。在这个“基本条规”中除划定东部边界的具体规定外，还规定了避免边境冲突的措施，其中包括在边界两边划定各一百五十码宽的非武装地带。
    这次双方也发表了一项类似的西巴基斯坦—印度边界“基本条规”，它规定了，在对最后边界作出决定和对方所占的领土各归原主以前，为避免发生任何不幸事件和因而引起的紧张局势双方保安部队所应遵循的规定。
    “基本条规”规定，“任何一方都不得在这个实际边界的两边各一百五十码以内的地带驻有任何常驻或临时边境保安部队或任何其他武装人员，也不得在这个地带内新设任何前沿纠察岗哨或观察站。”原有的岗哨和观察站仍可保留，但是要把它们的表册开列对方。除了上述表册上提到的防御工事外，在这个三百码的地带中的防御工事，必须在今年3月15日以前拆毁或填平。
    这次两国关于西部边界问题的部长级谈判是从1月4日到11日在巴基斯坦的拉合尔、拉瓦尔品第和印度的德里举行的。印度代表团团长是钢铁、矿业和燃料部长辛格，巴基斯坦代表团团长是内政和警察情报部长谢赫中将。
