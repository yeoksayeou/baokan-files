Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, fearing the powerful movement of the masses opposing the signing of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," announced today that he would change the time of his departure for the United States tomorrow to sign this military alliance treaty, and would leave Haneda Airport early at 8:00 a.m. by special plane.

Nobusuke Kishi was originally scheduled to depart at 10:00 p.m. tomorrow. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) planned to stage a demonstration against the signing of the military alliance treaty on the road to the airport. It is reported that the change in departure time was jointly decided by Nobusuke Kishi and officials of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and cabinet officials, with the aim of evading the people's demonstrations.

At the same time, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has mobilized 10,000 police officers to guard Haneda Airport and the road from Nobusuke Kishi's residence to the airport. Two hours before Kishi's departure, this road will be closed to all traffic. Nobusuke Kishi's vehicle will be escorted by one hundred police officers. Kyodo News Agency said that this is the first time in Japanese history that so many police officers have been mobilized to escort the head of government.

    改变启程赴美时间　动员大批警察护送    
    岸信介被迫作出安排以逃避人民示威
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介因为害怕人民群众反对签署新日美“安全条约”的强大运动，今天宣布改变在明天动身前往美国签订这项军事同盟条约的时间，提前在清早八点钟就乘专机离开羽田机场。
    岸信介原来预定明天晚上十点钟启程。日本工会总评议会准备在通往飞机场的路上展开反对签订军事同盟条约的示威。据报道，变动启程时间是岸信介同东京警察当局的官员和内阁官员们共同商定的，目的是逃避人民的示威。
    同时，东京警察当局已经动员一万名警察守卫羽田机场和从岸信介住所通往机场的道路。在岸信介动身前两小时，这条道路就禁止一切交通往来。岸信介本人乘坐的车辆将由一百名警察护送。共同社说，这是日本历史上第一次动员这样多的警察来护送政府的首脑。
