        Heroic Train
        In our glorious era, there are countless new people and new events to talk about.
        A train in motion, because of a sudden rainstorm and flood that washed away the railway foundation, was forced to be stranded on a high slope, unable to advance or retreat. Their contact with their superiors was cut off, and the flood continued to rise, seriously threatening the lives of more than 800 passengers on the train. At this critical moment, the train's Party branch led and organized all the passengers to fight the flood and persevere to the final victory. The "Heroic Train," collectively created and performed by the Experimental Theater of the Central Academy of Drama, vividly reflects the new spirit of the new people in our socialist era through such new people and new events.

    英雄的列车
    在我们这个辉煌的时代里，有着千千万万说不完的新人新事。
    一列正在行进的火车，因为突然降临的暴风雨和洪水冲毁了铁道路基，被迫困在高坡上进退不得。他们和上级的联系中断了，洪水还在继续上涨，严重威胁着全车八百多名旅客的生命安全。就在这个紧急的时候，列车的党支部领导和组织了全车群众和洪水进行战斗，坚持到最后胜利。中央戏剧学院实验话剧院集体创作和演出的“英雄列车”，就是通过这样一个新人新事，生动地反映了我们社会主义时代新人的新面貌。
