    Korean "Rodong Sinmun" Publishes Editorial Pointing Out That Provincial Party Committees Should Unify Leadership Over Central and Local Enterprises Within the Province; Factory Party Committees Are the Highest Organs Within Factories

    The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on January 7th entitled "Provincial Party Committees Must Be Fully Responsible for the Execution of All Economic Tasks Within the Province." The editorial stated:

    Today, in response to the resolution of the enlarged December Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, which called on the entire party and all the people to prepare for battle to seize new heights in the Second Five-Year Plan, we are taking the first step in implementing the "buffer period" tasks.

    The provincial Party committees, in an environment of high creativity, enthusiasm and production zeal among the working people, and under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee, are convening plenary sessions to implement the resolutions of the December Enlarged Plenary Session.

    Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out that the central direction for discussion at the meeting should be that, in the future, each provincial Party committee will be fully responsible for the implementation of all economic tasks within its province, and that it should lead and grasp this. Therefore, the provincial Party committee plenary sessions now underway must discuss the resolutions of the December Enlarged Plenary Session in accordance with this spirit, and concretize measures adapted to the actual conditions within their own provinces. As everyone knows, the party and government organs of the province, city, and county (note) play a very important role not only in the political life of the country, but also in the management, operation, and leadership of the people's economy.

    In the management of socialist enterprises, it is very important to closely combine bottom-up democracy with the centralized leadership of the ministries (note) and bureaus (note).

    In particular, it is necessary to actively involve the broad masses of producers in management, to give full play to their creativity, and to explore, mobilize, and utilize all local possibilities and potentials. All this depends mainly on the functions and roles of the party and government organs of the province, city, and county, as well as the factory party committees.

    Raising the responsibility of local party and government organs in leading the economy is a fundamental condition for maximizing the functions and creativity of the localities.

    In recent years, with the unprecedented growth of our industrial production, the central and local industrial enterprises in various provinces have increased and expanded rapidly. As a result, all cities and counties across the country have local industrial enterprises, and almost all have central industrial enterprises as well.

    It is not enough to rely solely on the central government to manage and operate so many enterprises well. The Party, taking into account the changes in the distribution of our industrial productive forces, reorganized the industrial management system in order to maximize the mobilization and utilization of our local possibilities and potentials, reorganized the new fighting forces to meet the Second Five-Year Plan, and adopted the wise measure of establishing a local industrial system alongside the central industries, greatly expanding the powers of the local government organs. This measure has opened up broad avenues for the further development of our people's economy.

    However, without strengthening the Party's leadership and grasp of all economic activities of factories and enterprises, these measures cannot truly exert their vitality.

    Therefore, the Party has taken the main measure of requiring the provincial Party committees to be responsible for leading the central industries and all economic sectors within the province, and to be fully responsible for the execution of the people's economic plan. In the future, the provincial Party committees will not only be responsible for agriculture, commerce, local industry, education, culture, and health, but will also be fully responsible for leading and grasping all aspects of the economic and cultural life of the central industries, enterprises, and even state-owned agricultural and livestock farms within the province.

    In view of this, the Cabinet will separately issue the plans of the ministries and bureaus and the people's economic plans of the various provinces.

    Thus, in the future, the relevant provincial Party committees, like the relevant ministries and bureaus, will also be fully responsible for the execution of the production plans of the central industrial and state-owned agricultural enterprises.

    However, this is by no means a transfer of the management of central industries to the localities, but rather a continuation of the responsibility of the central ministries and bureaus for managing the central industries, while at the same time coordinating with the provincial party organizations for the direct party leadership and grasp of the central industries and enterprises. This is the basic content of this measure. Therefore, the leadership responsibility of the relevant ministries and bureaus for the central enterprises must not be reduced or weakened.

    The measures taken by the Party this time are an important key to further developing local possibilities and creativity and further promoting our socialist construction in the development of the people's economy.

    The measures taken by the Party this time are another wise measure for further improving leadership work and adapting to the new environment and conditions created in our economy.

    What are the benefits of implementing this measure?

    Since the ministries, bureaus, and provincial party committees are all responsible for leading the production plans of the central industrial and state-owned agricultural enterprises, they can further closely combine the centralized leadership of the central government with the creativity of the localities, and they can also comprehensively lead and grasp the execution of the people's economic plan, so that the leadership of the enterprises can further penetrate among the masses of producers, and they can maximize the mobilization of all the human and material potentials of the localities.

    In the past, when the local party organs were not responsible for the execution of the production plans of the central industrial enterprises, there were inevitably such or such irrational phenomena. One of the bigger shortcomings was that there was no mutual exchange of experience and cooperation between the central enterprises within the same administrative region, or even with neighboring enterprises, and therefore they did not achieve the achievements they should have.

    The measures taken by the Party this time will overcome this irrational phenomenon, so that the activities of the various enterprises in the region can cooperate and exchange experience with each other under the unified leadership of the provincial party committee, and make it more popular.

    Also, in this way, it will be possible to eradicate the departmentalism of some economic leaders that was common in the past, and further strengthen the production cooperation and links between this or that enterprise.

    So, what is required to implement the Party's measures?

    The most important thing is to decisively improve the leading role and function of the provincial, city, and county party committees in the economy.

    The provincial party committee is the political headquarters responsible for organizing, leading, and grasping all work in the entire field of political, economic, and cultural life in the province, from production to consumption and distribution. Therefore, it must directly grasp and lead all the work of the central industrial, local industrial enterprises, and all sectors of the people's economy in the province; without exception, the party committees in all organs, factories, and enterprises in the province must carry out their work under the leadership and grasp of the provincial party committee.

    Here, the most important task is for the provincial party committee to strengthen the factory and enterprise party committees and be responsible for their leadership, and to further improve their functions and roles.

    The factory party committee is the highest organ in the factory. Everything in the factory must be carried out under the leadership of the factory party committee.

    Comrade Kim Il-sung said in this regard: "In the factory, the highest organ is not the factory director, but the factory party committee. The factory director and the party committee secretary work under the leadership of the factory party committee. The factory party committee also discusses economic work, and according to its decisions, the factory director carries out administrative work and the factory party committee secretary carries out party work."

    Therefore, the provincial, city, and county party committees must enable the factory party committees to correctly train cadres, strengthen organizational and political work among party members, consolidate the Party's internal affairs, and further enhance the vanguard role of party members in production. At the same time, they must constantly strengthen the Party's grasp and leadership of the enterprises' execution of the production plan, and complete or overfulfill the people's economic plan on a daily, monthly, and quarterly basis.

        (Note) The Korean "do" is equivalent to our country's province, the "gun" is equivalent to our country's county, and the "sheng" is equivalent to our country's central people's government's ministry.

### 朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论指出  道党委应统一领导道内中央和地方企业  工厂党委员会是工厂内的最高机关

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论指出
    道党委应统一领导道内中央和地方企业
    工厂党委员会是工厂内的最高机关
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”1月7日发表了题为“道（注）党委员会必须对执行道内一切经济任务负责”的社论。社论说：
    今天，我们响应党中央委员会十二月扩大全会为占领第二个五年计划的新高地而号召全党全民作战斗准备的决议，在执行“缓冲期”任务迈开了第一步。
    各道党委员会在劳动人民创造性、积极性和生产热情高涨的环境中，在党中央委员会的直接领导下，为了执行十二月扩大全会的决议正在召开全体会议。
    金日成同志提出，会议应讨论的中心方向时说，今后，各道党委员会对自己道内一切经济任务的执行负完全责任，并且要对此加以领导和掌握。因此，现在正在进行的道党委员会全体会议，必须根据这一精神来讨论十二月扩大全会的决议，具体化到适应自己道内实际情况的措施问题。大家知道，道、市、郡（注）的党和政权机关不仅在国家的政治生活中，而且在管理、经营和领导人民经济方面也占有很重要的位置。
    在管理社会主义企业中，把从下而上的民主和省（注）、局的中央集中领导密切结合起来是很重要的。
    特别是，在企业中，使广大的生产者积极参加管理，发挥他们的创造性，挖掘、动员和利用一切地方的可能性和潜力是必要的。这一切，主要地取决于道、市、郡党和政权机关，以及工厂党委员会的机能和作用。
    在领导经济中，提高地方党和政权机关的责任，是最大限度地发挥地方的机能和创造性的基本条件。
    近年来，随着我们工业生产的史无前例的增长，各道的中央和地方工业企业都有了迅速的增加和扩大。从而，全国各市、郡都有了地方工业企业，同时也几乎都有了中央工业企业。
    单靠中央去管理和经营好这么多的企业是不够的。党估计到我们工业生产力的分布上所起的变化，为了最大限度地动员和利用我们的地方可能性和潜力，改组了工业管理体系，改编了迎接第二个五年计划的新的战斗力量，采取了同中央工业一道建立地方工业体系的英明的措施，大大地扩大了地方政权机关的权限。这一措施为我们人民经济的进一步发展打开了广阔的道路。
    但是，如果不加强党对工厂、企业的一切经济活动的领导和掌握，就不能使这一切措施真正地发挥它的生命力。
    所以，党采取了要道党委员会负责领导道内的中央工业以及一切经济部门，并完全负责人民经济计划的执行的主要措施。道党委员会今后不仅对农业、商业、地方工业、教育、文化、卫生负责，而且要对中央工业、企业以至国营农牧场的道内的经济、文化生活的各方面都要完全负责领导和掌握。
    有鉴于此，内阁将分别下达省、局的计划和各道的人民经济计划。
    从而，今后同有关省、局一样，有关道党委员会也要完全负责中央工业和国营农业企业关于生产计划的执行。
    但是，这决不是把中央工业的管理移交给地方，而是由中央省、局继续负责管理中央工业，同时配合道党组织对中央工业、企业的直接的党的领导和掌握，这是这一措施的基本内容。所以，决不能降低或削弱有关省、局对中央企业的领导责任。
    党这次采取的措施，是在发展人民经济中进一步发挥地方可能性和创造性，进一步促进我们的社会主义建设的重要的关键。
    党这次采取的措施，是为了领导工作进一步改进，适应我国经济中造成的新的环境和条件的又一个英明的措施。
    实现这一措施后有什么好处呢？
    由于省、局和道党委员会都对中央工业和国营农业企业的生产计划负责领导，能够进一步密切结合中央集中领导和地方的创造性，也能够全面领导和掌握执行人民经济计划，使企业的领导能够进一步深入生产者群众之中，就能够最大限度地动员地方的人和物的一切潜力。
    过去，在地方党的机关对中央工业企业执行生产计划没有负责任的时候，不可避免地有这样或那样的不合理现象。其中，较大的缺点之一就是，在同一个行政区域之内的中央企业之间，甚至和邻近的企业之间也没有互相交流经验和协作，因而没有获得应有的成就。
    党这次采取的措施将克服这种不合理现象，使本地区内的各个企业的活动在道党委员会的统一领导下互相协作和交流经验，并使它更加普及。
    又由于这样，将能根除从前常见的部分经济领导人员的机关本位主义的态度，并将进一步加强这种或那种企业相互间的生产协作和联系。
    那么，为了实现党的措施要求什么呢？
    最重要的是：决定性地提高道、市、郡党委员会对经济的领导作用和机能。
    道党委员会是在本道政治、经济、文化生活整个领域内，从生产直到消费、分配，负责组织、领导和掌握一切工作的政治参谋部。因此，它必须直接掌握和领导中央工业、地方工业企业以及道内人民经济各部门的一切工作；道内的一切机关、工厂、企业内的党委员会都不能例外地要在道党委员会领导和掌握下进行工作。
    在此，最重要的任务是：道党委员会要使工厂、企业的党委员会更加巩固，并负责对它的领导，进一步提高它的机能和作用。
    工厂党委员会是工厂内的最高机关。工厂内的一切事情必须在工厂党委员会的领导下进行。
    金日成同志就此说：“在工厂，最高机关不是厂长，而是工厂党委员会。厂长和党委员长在工厂党委员会的领导下进行工作。工厂党委员会也讨论经济工作，根据它的决议，由厂长进行行政工作，工厂党委员长进行党的工作。”
    因此，道、市、郡党委员会要使工厂党委员会正确地培养干部，在党员之中加强组织政治工作，巩固党的内部，在生产中进一步提高党员的先锋作用。同时，经常加强党对企业执行生产计划的掌握和领导，要按日、按月、按季完成或超额完成人民经济计划。
        （注）朝鲜的“道”相当于我国的省，“郡”相当于我国的县，“省”相当于我国中央人民政府的部。
