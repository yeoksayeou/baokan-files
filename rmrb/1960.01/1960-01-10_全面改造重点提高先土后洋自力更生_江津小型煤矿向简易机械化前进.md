Comprehensive Transformation Emphasizes Improvement, Prioritizing Indigenous Methods over Foreign Ones, Self-Reliance
Jiangjin Small Coal Mines Advance Towards Simple Mechanization

    (Our report) Sichuan Jiangjin's small-scale coal industry adheres to the principle of "walking on two legs," adopting methods that prioritize indigenous techniques, combining indigenous and foreign approaches, starting small and then scaling up, prioritizing indigenous methods before foreign ones, and relying on self-reliance and local resources. It actively carries out technical transformation of small coal mines, greatly improving the working conditions of small coal mines, increasing production capacity and labor efficiency, and reducing costs.

    Most of the small coal mines in the Jiangjin Special Zone that use indigenous production methods were developed during the Great Leap Forward for steel production in 1958. Their equipment and technical conditions were relatively poor. At the beginning of last year, the Jiangjin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the layout of the iron and steel industry and the coal requirements of other industries, decided to comprehensively transform small coal kilns, focusing on improvement and gradually moving towards small-scale foreign techniques. At that time, the Prefectural Committee assigned a member to specifically manage the technical transformation of coal mines. Each coal mine also formed a technical innovation committee, headed by the branch secretary, to focus on key production issues and mobilize the masses to carry out an indigenous mechanization movement, transforming the hoisting, transportation, ventilation, and lighting equipment of the mines. Through pilot projects and promotion, in less than a year, the entire region created and promoted more than 1,400 pieces of indigenous windlasses, indigenous coal washing machines, indigenous water pumps, indigenous coal screening machines, indigenous coal crushing machines, indigenous winnowing machines, and indigenous shuttle buckets, increasing work efficiency by one to dozens of times. They also created and promoted more than 22,000 pieces of advanced tools such as hand-cranked drills, long-handled chisels, and large-headed adjustable picks. They invented and manufactured indigenous explosives, indigenous detonators, and indigenous gas lamps, and found ways to use lime water and ammonium sulfate to replace sulfuric acid for battery charging.

    After the technical transformation of small coal kilns, not only was the lifespan of the mines extended and production increased, but also labor was saved. Currently, of the 10,000 tons of raw coal produced daily in the region, 4,000 tons are produced by the transformed small coal kilns. After the technical transformation of Yongchuan Tongxing Coal Mine, the number of workers was reduced by 50%, the full-employee efficiency of raw coal increased by 250%, the average daily output increased by 230%, and the cost per ton of raw coal was reduced to 2.86 yuan, and coke was reduced to 22.59 yuan.

    As a result of the continuous transformation of small coal kilns, the region's coal production has continued to rise. In 1959, the daily production level remained above 10,000 tons. Raw coal production exceeded 66% of the total production in 1958, and coke increased by nearly 1.3 times compared with 1958. They not only fulfilled the plan to produce 3.2 million tons of coal and 330,000 tons of coke for the whole year three months ahead of schedule, but also ensured the needs of the local iron and steel industry and civilian use, and could also transfer a part to support other industrial areas in the province.

### 全面改造重点提高先土后洋自力更生  江津小型煤矿向简易机械化前进

    全面改造重点提高先土后洋自力更生
    江津小型煤矿向简易机械化前进
    本报讯　四川江津小型煤炭工业坚持两条腿走路方针，采取以土为主，土洋结合，先小后大，先土后洋，自力更生，就地取材的办法，积极进行小型煤矿的技术改造工作，大大改善了小型煤矿的劳动条件，提高了生产能力和劳动效率，降低了成本。
    江津专区土法生产的小型煤矿，大部分是在1958年大办钢铁运动中发展起来的，设备、技术条件都比较差。去年初，中共江津地委根据钢铁工业布局和其它行业用煤的情况，决定对小型煤窑进行全面改造，重点提高，逐步走上小洋群的道路。当时地委抽出一个委员专管煤矿的技术改造工作，各煤矿也以支部书记为首，组成技术革新委员会，抓住生产关键，发动群众开展土机械化运动，改造矿井的提升、运输、通风、照明等设备。通过试点推广，在不到一年的时间内，全区创造和推广土绞车、土洗煤机、土抽水机、土筛煤机、土碎煤机和土风簸、土梭斗共一千四百多件，提高工效一倍到几十倍；还创造和推广了手摇搬钻、长炮钎、大头活动啄子等先进工具二万二千多件，发明和制造了土炸药、土雷管、土煤气灯，找到了用石灰水、硫酸铵代替硫酸冲电等办法。
    小煤窑经过技术改造以后，不仅延长了矿井寿命，增加了生产，而且节省了劳动力。目前，全区日产原煤一万吨当中，有四千吨都是改造后的小煤窑生产的。永川同兴煤矿经过了技术改造后，工人减少50％，原煤全员工效提高250％，平均日产量提高230％，每吨原煤成本降低到二元八角六分，焦炭降低到二十二元五角九分。
    由于小煤窑不断改造的结果，全区煤炭产量不断上升，1959年日产水平一直保持在一万吨以上。原煤产量超过1958年总产量的66％，焦炭比1958年增长近一点三倍。并提前三个月完成了全年产煤三百二十万吨，产焦三十三万吨的计划。不仅保证了本区钢铁工业和民用的需要，还可以调出一部分支援省内其它工业地区。
