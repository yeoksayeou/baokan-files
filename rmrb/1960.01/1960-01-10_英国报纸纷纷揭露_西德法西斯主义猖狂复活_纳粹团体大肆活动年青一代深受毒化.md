Xinhua News Agency, January 9th dispatch from London: British newspapers have recently published numerous reports exposing the revival of Nazism in West Germany.

    The "Daily Mail" published on January 5th a report from Hamburg, West Germany, by its correspondent Robert Muller, who was born in Germany.

    Muller wrote: "In the past few days, I have visited some teachers (including my own teachers) and some childhood friends who were once members of the Hitler Youth and are now teachers, educating the younger generation of Germany (West Germany). I have come to the conclusion that the recent anti-Semitic atrocities in Cologne and other places in Germany (West Germany) are not isolated incidents caused by hooligans or followers of a certain party, but a symptom of a national cancer..."

    Muller also pointed out that these new Nazi West German youth groups "can move freely," and many of these organizations have merged into national groups, such as the "German National Youth Movement" and the "National Student Union." Recently, the "National Student Union" held a public gathering, where the swastika flag was hung in the venue, and attendees openly sang the Nazi national anthem.

    Muller said that a West German teacher who had opposed the Nazi regime told him: "In these new nationalist youth groups, young people are educated to justify Hitler's actions. When I see children walking into my classroom in 1960, wearing new Nazi uniforms, and talking eloquently about 'liberating' the eastern regions and about war being a natural law of mankind, what do you think I would feel? I know that one child still has a picture of Goebbels (Hitler's propaganda minister) hanging on his bedside." Muller said: "According to conversations with many young men and women I have visited, they believe that Hitler was a man who built highways, canals, and bridges, and he solved the unemployment problem."

    Muller pointed out the poisonous influence of fascist education on the minds of West German youth. For example, "One teacher found anti-Semitic drawings and slogans like 'They didn't gas enough of them' painted on the classroom blackboard. When the teacher asked who did it, almost every student in the classroom proudly raised their hands."

    Muller wrote that a teacher's wife told me: "In my company, employees are again greeting customers with 'Heil Hitler.' This is very common now. No one cares. Customers also respond with 'Heil Hitler,' and everyone laughs."

    The "Daily Express" also published on December 31st a dispatch from Frankfurt, West Germany, by Colin Lawson, entitled "I Found Hitler's Henchmen."

    Lawson pointed out that "in the eleven major cities of the Ruhr area, the heads of the former Hitler SS elite troops have all become police chiefs." For example, former SS head Fritz Koennecke is now the deputy director of the Essen police department, and former SS Major Fritz Weber is now the head of the West German Ministry of the Interior responsible for all police forces in North Rhine-Westphalia.

    Lawson said that because of the appearance of these former Nazis, in Gelsenkirchen in the Ruhr area, a Catholic church was covered with white swastikas overnight.

    Lawson also said that he heard that a teacher in Frankfurt told his students: "The Jews being gassed was not the fault of the Germans. It was their own fault because they resisted the authorities."

    In another telegram from West Berlin entitled "Nazi Control Tightens, I Smell Hitler in Twelve Parties in (West) Berlin," Lawson reported that in West Berlin, there are currently "twelve Nazi-style parties active," "There are one thousand two hundred and fifty former military groups organized in a tightly controlled Nazi manner, thirty magazines, forty-seven publishing houses, twenty book clubs, and one hundred and twenty-six well-known Hitler writers serving Nazi propaganda."

    On January 3rd, the "Sunday Express" also published an editorial entitled "Ominous Signals." After mentioning the fact that the swastika has once again appeared on synagogues in West Germany, the editorial said, "Who can believe that the re-enactment of the old German events will end with the painting of swastikas?" The editorial said that territorial claims will soon be made. The editorial asked: "Are we really going to provide (West Germany) with those terrible (nuclear) weapons to support this demand?"

### 英国报纸纷纷揭露  西德法西斯主义猖狂复活  纳粹团体大肆活动年青一代深受毒化

    英国报纸纷纷揭露
    西德法西斯主义猖狂复活
    纳粹团体大肆活动年青一代深受毒化
    据新华社9日讯　伦敦消息：英国报纸最近刊载了许多揭露纳粹主义在西德复活的报道。
    “每日邮报”1月5日发表了出生在德国的该报记者罗伯特·谬勒从西德汉堡发回的一篇报道。
    谬勒写道：“在过去几天，我曾经访问了一些教员（包括我自己的老师在内）和某些儿时的朋友，他们过去是希特勒青年军的成员，现在又当了教师，教育德国（西德）青年一代，我得出的结论是，最近在科隆和德国（西德）其他地方发生的反犹太暴行不是流氓或某一个党派的追随者搞出来的孤立事件，而是一种全国性的癌症征候……”。
    谬勒还指出，这些新纳粹的西德青年团体“可以自由行动”，其中许多组织已经合并成全国性团体，诸如“德意志全国青年运动”和“全国学生联合会”等。最近，“全国学生联合会”曾举行了一次公开集会，会场上悬挂着卐字旗，到会者公然唱起了纳粹国歌。
    谬勒说，一个曾反对纳粹政权的西德教师告诉他：“在这些新的国家主义青年团体中，人们教育少年们为希特勒的行为辩解。当我看见孩子们在1960年走进我的教室，穿着新纳粹的制服，滔滔不绝地说出‘解放’东部地区和关于战争是人类自然规律的话时，你想想看我会有什么样的感觉？我知道，有一个孩子仍然把戈培尔（希特勒的宣传部长）的照片挂在床头。”谬勒说：“根据我访问过的许多少年男女的谈话，他们认为，希特勒是一个兴修汽车路、运河和桥梁的人，他解决了失业问题。”
    谬勒指出法西斯教育对西德少年思想的毒害。例如，“有一个教员发现，教室的黑板上涂着反犹太的画和‘他们用瓦斯毒死的人还不够’之类的标语。当教师问这是谁干的时候，差不多教室里每一个学生都自豪地举起了手。”
    谬勒写道，一个教师的妻子告诉我：“在我的公司里，职员又用‘希特勒万岁’来招呼顾客了。这已经是很普通的事。没有人在乎。顾客也答以‘希特勒万岁’，大家都笑。”
    “每日快报”去年12月31日也刊载了科林·劳逊从西德的法兰克福发出的一篇题为“我发现希特勒的党羽”的通讯。
    劳逊指出，“在鲁尔区的十一个大城市中，前希特勒党卫军精锐部队的头子都当上了警察首脑。”例如：前党卫军头子弗里茨·科伊内克现在是埃森警察局的副局长，前党卫军少校弗里茨·韦伯现在是西德内政部负责北来因—威斯特伐利亚州全部警察力量的首脑。
    劳逊说，由于这些前纳粹分子的出现，在鲁尔区的盖尔森基尔欣，一夜之间，一个天主教教堂的墙上画满了白色的卐字。
    劳逊还说，他听说，法兰克福的一个教师告诉他的学生：“犹太人被用煤气毒死并不是德国人的过错。这是他们自己的过错，因为他们抵抗当局。”
    劳逊在另一篇从西柏林发出的、题为“纳粹的控制在加紧，我在（西）柏林在十二个政党中发现希特勒的气味”的电讯中报道说，在西柏林，目前“有十二个纳粹式的政党在活动”，“有一千二百五十个以纳粹严密的集中控制方式组织起来的前军人团体，有三十种杂志、四十七个出版社、二十个图书俱乐部和一百二十六个有名的希特勒作家正在为纳粹式的宣传服务。”
    1月3日，“星期日快报”也以“不祥的信号”为题发表社论。社论谈到卐字又一次出现在西德的犹太会堂上这一事实后说，“谁能相信旧德国事件的重演会以涂抹卐字告结束？”社论说，不久就会提出领土要求的。社论问道：“我们难道真的要提供（西德）那种可怕的（核）武器来支持这种要求吗？”
