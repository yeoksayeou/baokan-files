Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th: Solovyov, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, told our reporter that the task of Soviet trade unions in 1960 is to further mobilize and organize the working masses to struggle for the fulfillment of the second year's tasks of the Seven-Year Plan. He said that it is necessary to transform every backward production unit into an advanced production unit, and to enable every enterprise, section, workshop, and worker to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule and above quota.

In reviewing the work of Soviet trade unions in the past year, Solovyov said that in the past year, Soviet trade unions, inspired by the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, under the leadership of the Party, mobilized 35 million trade union members and other workers to struggle for the overfulfillment and early fulfillment of the first year's tasks of the Seven-Year Plan.

In 1959, Soviet trade unions elevated the task of increasing production and improving labor productivity to the center of all trade union work. At the plenary sessions of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, and at the meetings of local trade unions and grassroots trade unions at all levels, this issue was seriously and thoroughly discussed, and it was taken as the most important task of trade union work. Over the past year, Soviet trade union work has also created many new working methods, such as the establishment of mass social supervision in enterprises in various places, which has played a huge role in the timely commissioning of new enterprises, the promotion of automation and mechanization of production, saving raw materials, reducing costs, improving quality, and tapping production potential.

Solovyov said that on the basis of the high enthusiasm of the masses for labor, Soviet trade unions organized socialist labor competitions in various forms and content last year. The production competition to win the glorious title of "Communist Labor Brigade" and "Communist Shock Worker" has been launched more widely and deeply in enterprises and construction sites across the country. As of the end of last year, 200,000 production units across the country had participated in this competition, with the number of participants reaching more than 3 million. More than 10,000 production units have won the glorious title of "Communist Labor Brigade," and 15,000 people have won the title of "Communist Shock Worker." The Kaganova movement of advanced helping the backward has also been further developed across the country, with more than 11,000 people participating in this movement. Last year, trade unions at all levels did a great deal of work in helping competitive units to complete their competition conditions and promote advanced production experience. In 1960, various forms of socialist labor competition will be developed more widely and deeply.

Speaking of the achievements made by Soviet trade unions in conducting political and ideological education for workers last year, Solovyov said that while implementing the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, Soviet trade unions placed their activities on educating all workers in communism, educating all working people to love labor, enthusiastically undertake social obligations, strengthen collectivist concepts, and improve communist morality.

Solovyov said that Soviet trade unions regard improving the cultural and technical level of the working people as one of the most frequent tasks. In the past year, millions of workers have learned new professions and improved their technical level without leaving production, and hundreds of thousands of workers are studying in higher and secondary specialized schools, correspondence schools, and youth night schools. Hundreds of thousands of workers and staff are studying in more than 1,000 people's cultural universities.

Solovyov concluded by saying that the role of Soviet trade unions in economic construction, cultural construction, and mobilizing the masses to complete the tasks proposed by the Party is constantly growing. The main task of trade unions and their leading bodies is to more fully utilize their broad powers to ensure further improvement of the working people's enthusiasm, militancy, and creativity in communist construction.

    索洛维耶夫谈苏联工会1960年新的任务
    动员广大职工完成今年生产计划
    要使每一个落后的生产单位都变成先进的生产单位，使每个企业、工段、车间和每个工人都提前和超额完成今年的生产计划
    据新华社莫斯科7日电　全苏工会中央理事会书记处书记索洛维耶夫对本社记者说，苏联工会1960年的任务是：更进一步动员和组织劳动群众，为完成七年计划第二年的任务而斗争。他说，要使每一个落后的生产单位都变成先进的生产单位，使每个企业、工段、车间和每个工人都提前和超额完成今年的生产计划。
    索洛维耶夫在回顾过去一年来的苏联工会工作情况时说，苏联工会在过去一年中，为苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议所鼓舞，在党的领导下动员三千五百万工会会员和其它劳动者为超额和提前完成七年计划第一年的任务而斗争。
    1959年，苏联工会把增加生产和提高劳动生产率的任务提高到工会一切工作的中心。在全苏工会中央理事会的历次全会上，在各级地方工会和基层工会的会议上，都认真地对这一问题进行了系统和深入的讨论，并把它作为工会工作的最首要的任务。一年来，苏联工会工作也创造了许多新的工作方法，如在各地企业中建立了群众的社会监督，这对新建企业的及时投入生产、推进生产的自动化和机械化、节约原料降低成本、提高质量和发掘生产潜力都发挥了巨大的作用。
    索洛维耶夫说，在群众劳动热情高涨的基础上，苏联工会在去年组织了各种形式和内容的社会主义劳动竞赛。为争取“共产主义劳动队”和“共产主义突击手”的光荣称号而展开的生产竞赛，已在全国各企业和建筑工地中更广泛和更深入地展开。截至去年年底为止，全国已有二十万个生产单位参加这个竞赛，参加的人数达到三百万人以上。已有一万多个生产单位获得了“共产主义劳动队”的光荣称号，有一万五千人获得了“共产主义突击手”的称号。先进帮助落后的加干诺娃运动也在全国进一步展开，有一万一千多人参加了这个运动。各级工会去年在帮助竞赛单位完成自己的竞赛条件和推广先进生产经验方面进行了巨大的工作。在1960年里，各种形式的社会主义劳动竞赛还要获得更广泛、更深入的发展。
    在谈到去年苏联工会在进行对职工的政治思想教育所取得的成就时，索洛维耶夫说，苏联工会在实现苏共第二十一次代表大会决议的同时，把自己的活动放在对全体职工进行共产主义的教育上，教育全体劳动人民热爱劳动、热心地承担社会义务、加强集体主义观念和提高共产主义的道德水平。
    索洛维耶夫说，苏联工会把提高劳动人民的文化和技术水平作为最经常的任务之一。去年一年中成百万职工不脱离生产地学会了新的专业和提高了技术水平，几十万职工在高等和中等专科学校、函授学校和青年夜校中进行学习。几十万名工人和职员在一千多所人民文化大学里学习。
    索洛维耶夫最后说，苏联工会在经济建设、文化建设和动员群众完成党提出的任务方面的作用，正在不断地增长。工会及其领导机关的主要任务是：更加充分地利用它们的广泛的权力，以保证进一步提高劳动人民在共产主义建设中的积极性、战斗性和创造性。
