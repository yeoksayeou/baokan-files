    On a day when the snow had just cleared, we visited a very special iron and steel plant. Here, there was no overwhelming smog, no sight of splashing molten iron flowing, nor towering blast furnaces and so many huge factory buildings. Here, however, there were giant cylinders suspended in the open square, constantly rotating. They were rotary furnaces, sixty meters long and three point six meters in diameter. Such a peculiar iron and steel plant, set against the backdrop of the white snow, appeared particularly clean and quiet. For those who have visited general iron and steel plants, it was indeed a very novel experience. This plant is called the "Chongjin Iron Works," and its product is not ordinary pig iron, but "granular iron," a high-quality iron like iron sand, which can be used directly to make special steel.

    What impressed us even more was the strong will of the Korean people to build socialism through self-reliance, as demonstrated by the plant's production policy. The socialist family has provided tremendous fraternal assistance to the socialist construction of the Korean people. The Korean Workers' Party has conducted in-depth internationalist education among the Korean people. While the Korean people are very grateful for this great assistance from fraternal countries, they emphasize the spirit of self-reliance. Korea is a place lacking bituminous coal, especially coking bituminous coal. Can anthracite coal be used to make iron? This is a major issue that Korean comrades are working hard to study. We have visited several steel and machinery plants, and the Korean comrades are very grateful for China's support in providing them with a large amount of coking coal. However, their efforts are directed at how to reduce the import of coking coal. One of the biggest advantages of producing granular iron is that it does not require the import of coking coal, but uses anthracite coal produced domestically to directly make iron.

    The method of producing granular iron is to grind iron ore into powder, mix it with anthracite coal powder in a certain proportion, and send it to the giant rotary furnace that is constantly rotating. After high-temperature combustion and several complex processes, granular iron is produced.

    Compared with general pig iron, granular iron has many advantages: First, it does not require the import of coking coal. This plant can save more than 40,000 tons of coking coal annually. Second, it can use low-grade ore that other plants do not use. Korean plants generally use ore with an iron content of 56% or more, but this plant can produce granular iron using ore with an iron content of only 35% to 40%. Third, because there is no need to build blast furnaces and corresponding huge factory buildings, the equipment cost is low, and the construction cost is only 40% of that of a pig iron plant. Fourth, the quality of granular iron is higher than that of pig iron. Korean general pig iron contains 3.2% carbon, while granular iron contains only 1.5%; therefore, it can be directly used to make special steel, which can reduce the cost of steelmaking. Fifth, it saves labor. Because the production of granular iron can use low-grade ore and does not require coking and other processes, it takes an average of about 1,200 workers to produce one ton of pig iron in Korea, while it only takes more than 700 workers to produce one ton of granular iron.

    However, there are also many technical difficulties in making granular iron. It is said that many countries have not solved these difficulties well. Because of this, the production of granular iron is not well developed in the world. For example, in the giant rotary furnace, after the iron melts, it often sticks to the refractory bricks on the furnace wall, and the furnace wall is covered with a thick layer in a few days, requiring the furnace to be shut down for repairs. During the Japanese occupation, it produced less than ten days a month and had to be shut down for repairs for more than twenty days. The Korean comrades were not deterred by this difficulty. After unremitting efforts, they can now produce continuously for forty to forty-five days. During the Japanese occupation, the daily output of a rotary furnace was only thirty or forty tons, while the design capacity of this rotary furnace was sixty tons. Since the "Chollima Movement," there was a long period when the daily output of this plant approached the design capacity, but the workers were determined to exceed the design capacity. In order to break through the design capacity of sixty tons, the workers fought against those who adhered to old rules. They spent a full three months conducting hundreds of experiments, and finally achieved a new record of 90 tons per day at the end of August 1959. The highest record reached 130 and 172 tons, and the average daily output is now consolidated at 80 to 100 tons. The Chongjin Iron Works has a total of six rotary furnaces. During the Japanese occupation, the highest annual output was 51,000 tons. When the Soviet army liberated Korea, the Japanese destroyed 80% of the rotary furnaces. In 1949, the Korean workers had just repaired the plant when it was severely damaged by US imperialism in 1950. Now it is being repaired for the second time. In 1959, the annual output of this plant reached 110,000 tons. This shows how magnificently the comrades of the Chongjin Iron Works have advanced to after overcoming enormous difficulties.

    Full of ambition, the comrades of the Chongjin Iron Works are not satisfied with their current achievements. They are working hard to solve another problem that has not been well solved in the world: continuously refining the granular iron they produce into special steel. Now, after producing granular iron, it must be cooled, sent to the Chongjin Steel Plant, and then heated to make steel. There is a great waste in this back-and-forth transportation and the process of cooling and heating. Continuous steelmaking would increase the wealth of the country a lot. Now, the machine repair shop of the Chongjin Iron Works has manufactured a complete set of machines and is building an intermediate experimental factory for continuous steelmaking. The rotary furnace in this factory is twenty meters long and one point two meters in diameter. After the intermediate experimental factory is successful, this iron and steel plant will be expanded into a more modern steel plant. Who will provide them with a complete set of steelmaking equipment? Comrade Park Yong-tae, the director of the plant and a Labor Hero of the Republic, said: "It mainly depends on themselves." He said that in the machine tool production machine tool movement, the daring and capable machine repair department has actually developed into a very capable metallurgical machinery manufacturing plant.

    Now, the output of granular iron from this plant accounts for 15% of the country's iron production. According to Director Park, the current policy of Korea's ferrous metallurgical industry is to focus on the development of granular iron. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the Chongjin Iron Works will be greatly expanded, and equally large granular iron plants will be newly built in other parts of the Republic.

    In pig iron plants, how to use less imported coking coal is also a goal they are working hard to study. The comrades of the Hwanghae Iron Works have successfully trial-produced a "ferro-coke," which is made by grinding coking coal and iron ore into powder in a certain proportion to produce a kind of iron-containing coke. Ferro-coke not only greatly saves coking coal, but also can increase the output of ironmaking. Comrade Zhu Zhongming, director of the Ferro-coke Research Office of the factory, has received the national "People's Award" for the successful trial-smelting of ferro-coke. (Note) He told us that the Hwanghae Iron Works uses more than 100 train cars of Chinese coal every day, and they are very grateful for the brotherly assistance from China, but they always feel uneasy. They conducted more than 4,000 experiments, overcame countless difficulties, and finally produced ferro-coke, and used it to formally produce pig iron. This is a new technology in metallurgy. Only countries with very developed metallurgical industries are conducting research on ferro-coke, and Korea is the first to formally produce pig iron using ferro-coke. The coking time of ferro-coke is seven hours shorter than that of ordinary coke; using ferro-coke containing 10% iron to make iron can increase the output of pig iron by 7%-8%; and the coal consumption per ton of pig iron can also be reduced by 10%-12%.

    Efforts to save imported coal have formed a mass movement in Korea. At the Chongjin Railway Factory, experiments have been successfully carried out to use anthracite coal to make pig iron. The boilers originally suitable for using imported coal have also been transformed, which has created conditions for large boilers in thermal power plants to burn anthracite coal. The Madong Cement Plant near Pyongyang has also transformed the new Soviet-aided giant sintering furnace to make it suitable for using domestically produced anthracite coal. Even the railway transportation sector, which used to be thought to require the use of imported coal, has now completely switched to using domestically produced anthracite coal. After the Wonsan Railway Factory successfully tested the use of anthracite coal to make steel, it has formally started production. Comrade Kim Byong-cheon, a worker in the foundry workshop and a Labor Hero of the Republic, said: Importing one ton of coke from a foreign country is equivalent to importing one ton of pig iron. Therefore, saving coke is particularly important. Their factory now uses anthracite coal to replace 50% of the coke in steelmaking. This is also a new achievement in metallurgical technology.

    The Wonsan Railway Factory has even greater achievements in self-reliance. This factory was originally a vehicle repair and assembly plant built with the help of Poland. In March 1958, Premier Kim Il-sung visited the factory and encouraged them to be bold and capable and to produce vehicles. The workers enthusiastically responded to the Premier's call. The original plan was to produce 500 thirty-ton freight cars in 1958, but they completed 510 and successfully trial-produced sixty-ton freight cars.

    It is a very complicated task to gradually transform a vehicle repair and assembly plant into a factory that produces vehicles. The machine tools used for repair are not entirely suitable for producing machines. Unsuitable lathes need to be transformed. Who will transform them? Rely on yourself. Moreover, after transforming some lathes, it must not affect the completion of repair tasks. In addition, some new lathes need to be added. Should they ask the state for them? No, still rely on self-manufacturing. Also, the original factory buildings were for repair. In the past, vehicles to be repaired were sent in, disassembled, repaired, and then reassembled, so the factory building was only ninety meters long; now, to transform it into a workshop for producing vehicles, a complete assembly line from the production of parts to finished products is required, and the factory building must be at least three hundred meters long. Should they ask the state for money to build new factory buildings? No. Moreover, it takes a long time to build new factory buildings, so how can they start production immediately? After many fierce debates and the efforts of workers and technicians for several sleepless nights, they decided to use the original factory buildings and change a straight assembly line into three assembly lines that turn twice, and solved the complex technical problems of turning. The wheels and frames of vehicles require a lot of imported steel. How to save steel? Can they do without imported steel? The workers have also made great achievements in this regard. First, they learned from the experiences of the Soviet Union and China, using pig iron instead of steel for wheels. After three failures, they finally succeeded. Second, they used electric welding instead of riveting, saving 20% of the steel. This was also successful after failures and persistent trials despite the doubts and opposition of some people. By the second half of 1959, vehicle production had taken another leap forward, changing from producing thirty-ton freight cars to producing only sixty-ton freight cars. The current production capacity has increased to 120 vehicles per month. Many people considered it a risky behavior to make the chassis of sixty-ton freight cars without imported high-quality steel. However, the workers used electric welding to increase the strength of domestically produced steel and manufactured one freight car, and then used imported steel to manufacture another. They conducted various scientific comparative tests on these two freight cars, and the results proved that the freight car made of domestically produced steel was not of poorer quality than the freight car made of imported steel, but the steel was thicker and heavier. Now, the problems of thickness and weight have also been solved after many efforts.

    The comrades of the Wonsan Railway Factory told us that in order to welcome the arrival of national railway electrification, they are actively preparing to produce electric carriages, and are determined to gradually reduce repair tasks and completely transform the entire factory into a factory that produces electric carriages in a few years. In this way, the factory's equipment must be gradually transformed, and many new equipment must be added. "Will you solve these new equipment yourself?" we asked. The chief engineer said: "Yes, we are still responsible for it ourselves!"

    "Responsible for it ourselves!" What a strong will! The Korean Workers' Party pays attention to cultivating this strong will among the Korean people. This strong will has generated endless driving force for construction. Comrade Kim Do-man, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, and several other comrades have said similar things to us: "1+1=2" is a formula of elementary mathematics and a formula of formal logic, and cannot be used to measure the great achievements of Korean socialist construction. The Korean formula is: "1 + Enthusiasm = 10," equal to a hundred, or even a thousand, or ten thousand. The "1" here is the weak economic foundation that has been initially restored after being severely damaged by US imperialism; and the great achievements of the Korean "Chollima Movement" are the result of this "1 + Enthusiasm." Revolutionary enthusiasm armed with the strong will of self-reliance has blossomed countless wonderful flowers and borne countless fairy fruits in the Korean "Chollima Movement"; what other wonderful flowers will bloom and what other fairy fruits will bear? It is difficult for foreign friends to imagine.

    自力更生的坚强意志
    胡季委
    在一个大雪初晴的日子，我们参观了一个很特别的炼铁厂。这里没有漫天的浓烟，看不见火花四溅的铁水奔流，也看不见耸立的高炉和那样多的巨大厂房。这里却有一条条巨形的圆筒，悬挂在露天的广场上空，不断地旋转着。它们是一些长六十米、直径三点六米的回转炉。这样一个奇异的炼铁厂，在皑皑白雪的陪衬下，显得特别清洁、特别安静。对于曾经参观过一般炼铁厂的人来说，确是一件十分新鲜的事。这个厂叫“清津炼铁所”，它的产品，不是一般生铁，而是“粒铁”，是像铁砂一样的优质铁，可以用来直接炼成特殊钢。
    更使我们惊佩的，是透过这个厂的生产方针所表现出来的、朝鲜人民那种自力更生建设社会主义的坚强意志。社会主义大家庭对朝鲜人民的社会主义建设给予了巨大的兄弟援助。朝鲜劳动党对朝鲜人民进行了深入的国际主义教育。朝鲜人民一方面十分感谢兄弟国家这种伟大的援助，一方面强调自力更生的精神。朝鲜是一个缺乏烟煤的地方，特别是缺少可以炼焦的烟煤。能不能用无烟煤来炼铁呢？这是朝鲜同志努力钻研的一个大问题。我们参观过几个钢铁厂和机械厂，朝鲜的同志们都很感谢中国支援他们大量的焦煤。但是，他们的努力方向，却是如何减少焦煤的进口。炼粒铁的一个最大的好处，就是不用进口焦煤，而用本国出产的无烟煤直接炼铁。
    生产粒铁的方法，是把铁矿石磨成粉末，按一定比例混合上无烟煤粉末，送到那个不断转动着的巨型回转炉里去，经过高温的燃烧，经过几道复杂的工序，炼出粒铁。
    和一般生铁比较，粒铁有很多优点：首先是不用进口焦煤。这个厂全年可以节约四万多吨焦煤。第二，可以用其他厂不用的品位低的矿石。朝鲜一般厂用含铁量56％以上的矿石，这个厂只用含铁35％到40％的矿石就可以炼出粒铁。第三，因为不建高炉和相应的巨大厂房，设备造价低，建厂费只相当于炼生铁厂的40％。第四，粒铁的质量比生铁高。朝鲜一般生铁含炭素3．2％，粒铁只含1．5％；所以能够直接炼特殊钢，可以减低炼钢的成本。第五，节约劳动力。因为炼粒铁可以用品位低的矿石和不经过炼焦等工序，朝鲜炼一吨生铁平均约需一千二百个工，炼一吨粒铁只要七百多个工。
    但是，炼粒铁技术上的困难也很多。据说，很多国家对这些困难都没有很好解决。正因为这样，所以粒铁的生产在世界上并不发达。比如，在巨形的回转炉里，当铁熔化以后，往往要粘在炉壁的耐火砖上，没几天炉壁就结上了厚厚的一层，需要停炉修理。在日本统治时期，一个月生产不到十天，就要停工修理二十几天。朝鲜同志并没有被这个困难吓退，他们经过顽强的努力，现在已经可以连续生产四十天到四十五天。在日本统治时期，一个回转炉的日产量只有三、四十吨，而这个回转炉的设计能力是六十吨。“千里马运动”以来，有一个很长的时期，这个厂的日产量接近了设计能力，但是工人们决心要超过设计能力。为了突破六十吨的设计能力，工人们和墨守陈规的人们进行了斗争。他们花了整整三个月时间，进行了几百次试验，终于在1959年8月底达到了日产九十吨的新纪录，最高的纪录曾经达到一百三十、一百七十二吨，现在平均日产量巩固在八十吨到一百吨。清津炼铁所共有六个回转炉，在日本统治时期，最高年产量五万一千吨。在苏军解放朝鲜时，日本对回转炉的破坏程度达80％。1949年，朝鲜工人刚刚把这个厂修复，1950年又遭到美帝国主义的严重破坏，现在是第二次修复。1959年，这个厂的年产量已经达到十一万吨。这就可以看出，清津炼铁所的同志们在战胜了巨大的困难以后，已经挺进到了多么雄伟的高峰。
    满怀雄心大志的清津炼铁所的同志们并不满足于现在的成绩，他们正在努力解决另外一个也是世界上还没有很好解决的问题：把自己炼出来的粒铁连续炼成特殊钢。现在炼出粒铁，要加以冷却，送到清津炼钢厂，再加热炼钢。在这一往一返的运输和一冷一热的加工过程中，有很大的浪费。能够连续炼钢就会为国家增加很多财富。现在，清津炼铁所的机修车间已经制造了一整套机器，正在建设一个连续炼钢的中间性试验工厂。这个工厂的回转炉长二十米长，直径一点二米。经过中间性试验厂试验成功以后，这个炼铁厂就要扩大为一个更加现代化的钢铁厂。他们靠谁供给一整套炼钢设备呢？这个厂的厂长、共和国劳动英雄朴容泰同志说：“主要是靠他们自己。”他说，在机床生产机床运动中，敢想敢干的机修部门实际上已经发展成为一个十分能干的冶金机械制造厂了。
    现在，这个厂的粒铁产量，已经占全国铁产量的15％。据朴厂长说，目前朝鲜黑色冶金工业的方针，就是要把重点放在发展粒铁上面。在第二个五年计划期间，清津制铁所还要大大扩建，在共和国的其他地方也要新建同样巨大的粒铁工厂。
    在炼生铁的工厂里，如何少用进口焦煤，也是他们努力钻研的目标。黄海制铁所的同志们已经试制成功一种“铁焦”，是用焦煤和铁矿石按一定比例磨成粉，炼出一种含铁的焦炭。铁焦不只是大大节约焦煤，而且可以提高炼铁的产量。工厂铁焦研究室主任朱钟鸣同志，因为试炼铁焦成功，已经得到国家的“人民奖”。（注）他对我们表示，黄海制铁所每天要用中国煤一百多车皮，他们很感谢中国的兄弟支援，但是他们心里总感到不安。他们进行了四千多次试验，不屈不挠地战胜了无数的困难，终于炼成了铁焦，而且把它用来正式生产生铁。这是冶金方面的新技术，在世界上只有冶金业很发达的国家在进行关于铁焦的研究工作，而用铁焦正式生产生铁，朝鲜还是首创者。铁焦比普通焦炭的炼焦时间要短七小时；用含10％铁质的铁焦炼铁，生铁产量可增加7％—8％；每吨生铁的耗煤量也可以降低10％—12％。
    努力节约进口煤，已经在朝鲜形成了一个群众性的运动。在清津的铁道工厂，已经试验成功用无烟煤炼生铁。还把原来适宜于用进口煤的锅炉进行了改造，这样就创造了条件，使火力发电站的大型锅炉也可以用无烟煤燃烧。平壤附近的马洞水泥厂，也改造了苏联援助的新式巨型烧成炉，使它适宜于使用国产的无烟煤。连过去认为必须使用进口煤的铁道运输部门，现在也全部改用国产无烟煤了。元山铁道工厂在试验用无烟煤炼钢成功以后，已经正式进行了生产。铸造车间的工人、共和国劳动英雄金炳千同志说：从外国运进一吨焦炭，等于运进一吨生铁。因此，节约焦炭就显得特别重要。他们厂现在炼钢，有50％的焦炭已经用无烟煤来代替了。这也是冶金技术上的一项新成就。
    元山铁道工厂在自力更生方面还有更巨大的成就。这个厂原来是波兰帮助建成的车辆修配厂。1958年3月，金日成首相来厂视察，鼓励他们敢想敢干，生产车辆。工人们热烈响应了首相的号召，原计划1958年生产三十吨级的货车五百辆，结果完成了五百一十辆，而且试制成功了六十吨级的货车。
    要把一个车辆修配厂逐步改变为一个生产车辆的工厂，工作是很复杂的。修理用的机床不完全适合于生产机器。不适合的车床，要改造。谁来改造？靠自己。而且，把一部分车床改造以后，还不能影响修理任务的完成。此外，还要新增加一些车床。伸手向国家要吗？不能，还是靠自己制造。还有，原来的厂房，是为修理用的。过去，要修理的车辆送来了，拆开，修理，再装上，所以厂房只有九十米长；现在要改为生产车辆的车间，就要从生产零件到成品形成一套流水式的生产作业线，厂房至少要长达三百米。向国家要钱修新厂房吗？不能。而且修新厂房要很长的时间，怎么能够马上开始生产呢？经过多少场激烈的争论，经过工人和技术人员若干不眠之夜的努力，他们决定利用原来的厂房，把一条直线的流水作业线改为转弯两次的三条作业线，并且解决了转弯的复杂技术问题。生产车辆的车轮和车架要用很多进口钢。如何节约钢材？能不能不用进口钢材？工人同志在这方面也作出了巨大的成绩。首先是学习苏联和中国的经验，用生铁代钢作车轮，经过了三次失败，最后成功了。其次，用电焊代替铆接，节约了20％的钢材。这也是经过失败，在一些人怀疑和反对下，顽强地坚持试验，终于成功的。到1959年下半年，车辆生产又飞跃了一步，由生产三十吨级的货车改为完全生产六十吨级的货车，现在的生产能力已经提高到每月一百二十辆了。使六十吨级货车的底盘不用进口优质钢，不少人认为是冒险的行为。但是，工人们用电焊的办法使国产钢增加了强度，制造出一辆货车，再用进口钢制造另一辆。他们把这两辆货车，作了种种科学的对比试验，结果证明：国产钢造的货车并不比进口钢造的货车质量差，只是钢厚一些、重一些。现在，厚和重的问题，经过多次的努力也解决了。
    元山铁道工厂的同志们对我们说，为了迎接全国铁道电气化的到来，他们正在积极准备生产电气车厢，决心逐步缩小修理任务，在几年以后把整个工厂完全改变为生产电气车厢的工厂。这样，工厂的设备就要逐步进行改造，还要增加很多新的设备。“这些新设备由你们自己解决吗？”我们这样问。总工师同志说：“对，还是我们自己负责！”
    “自己负责！”这是多么坚强的意志！朝鲜劳动党注意培养了朝鲜人民这种坚强的意志。这种坚强意志产生了无穷无尽的建设动力。劳动党中央宣传部部长金道万同志和其他几位同志都对我们说过类似下面的一些话：“1＋1＝2”，这是初级数学的公式，是形式逻辑的公式，不能用它来衡量朝鲜社会主义建设的伟大成就。朝鲜的公式是：“1＋干劲＝10”，等于一百，甚至等于千，等于万。这里的“1”就是遭到美帝国主义严重破坏后经过初步恢复的薄弱的经济基础；而朝鲜的“千里马运动”所取得的巨大成就，就是这个“1＋干劲”的结果。用自力更生的坚强意志武装起来的革命干劲，已经在朝鲜“千里马运动”中开出了无数奇花，结出了无数仙果；还将开出什么奇花，结出什么仙果？外国的友人们是很难想像得到的。
    注：“人民奖”是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国对有特殊贡献的科学家、技术人员、艺术家和作家等的一种奖励。（附图片）
