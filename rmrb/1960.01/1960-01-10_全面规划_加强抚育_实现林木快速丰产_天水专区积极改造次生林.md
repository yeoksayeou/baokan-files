Comprehensive Planning, Strengthening Cultivation, and Achieving Rapid and High-Yield Forest Production
Tianshui Prefecture Actively Transforms Secondary Forests

(Our dispatch) The Tianshui area of Gansu Province has taken active measures to transform the natural secondary forests, which grow slowly, produce low timber yields, and have low economic value, striving for rapid and high-yield forest production.

The Tianshui area originally had precious and dense forest regions, but after the destruction and damage caused by the reactionary ruling classes of past dynasties, most of the area became barren hills and devastated forest land, with severe soil erosion and frequent natural disasters, and the broad masses lived in miserable poverty. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the masses implemented the policy of "relying on the mountains to nourish the mountains" and "protecting forests during production, and protecting forests through production," carrying out closure and conservation, which fundamentally changed the poverty-stricken state of affairs left over from the old society, and restored the vitality of the fragmented and devastated forest land. For example, after several years of closure and conservation, Wushan County has restored over 700,000 mu of natural secondary forests, more than double the amount before liberation. The timber reserves have increased from the original 30,000 cubic meters to 300,000 cubic meters, effectively controlling soil erosion and promoting the development of mountain production. However, the forests that have been restored are, after all, natural secondary forests, and have many shortcomings. The most prominent of these are slow tree growth, small reserves, low yields, poor quality materials, inadequate use of land and space, and weak protective effects, which cannot meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. Therefore, in the spring of 1959, the broad masses of forest area in Tianshui, with the spirit of continuous revolution, launched a new upsurge of construction in secondary forest areas, focusing on cultivation, transformation, and utilization.

In order to realize the rapid and high-yield production of natural secondary forests, the Tianshui forest areas first planted fast-growing and high-yield precious tree species in barren land, sparse forest land, and shrubland, implemented the principle of "comprehensive development and comprehensive utilization," and put forward the action measures and goals of "eight transformations and four utilizations" and "one-ization and three improvements." The "eight transformations" are: transforming treeless land into forested land; transforming sparse forests into dense forests; transforming shrubbery into arbor forests; transforming miscellaneous wood forests into economic forests; transforming short forests into medium-height forests; transforming sprout forests into seedling forests; transforming pure forests into mixed forests; and transforming single-layer forests into multi-layer forests. The "four utilizations" are: processing the miscellaneous shrubs cut down during the transformation of secondary forests into various boards, farm tools, charcoal, fiberboard, pulp, and various forest chemical products. "One-ization and three improvements" means that after the transformation of natural secondary forests, the goal of achieving a garden-like environment is achieved; and timber production and quality are improved; the utilization rate of forest land is improved; and the protective effect of forests is improved.

The work of transforming secondary forests in Tianshui forest areas has achieved great results. In the transformed areas, fast-growing and precious seedlings have grown densely, with a survival rate of generally over 90%. The Tange forest area in Wushan County has made full use of forest resources in conjunction with the transformation work, and by the end of September, it had produced 1,274 cubic meters of logs, 130 cubic meters of boards, more than 2,000 various farm tools, tens of thousands of catties of charcoal, 300 catties of acetic acid, and 150,000 catties of firewood. The income from firewood and charcoal alone can completely compensate for the expenditure on the transformation, strongly supporting industrial and agricultural production and increasing the income of the masses.

Currently, the masses in Tianshui are summarizing the experience of transforming secondary forests in 1959 and adopting the method of combining greening and transformation, striving to achieve the great task of covering mountains with green, dressing slopes in blue, making secondary forests high-yielding, and turning the earth into a garden.

    全面规划　加强抚育　实现林木快速丰产
    天水专区积极改造次生林
    本报讯　甘肃省天水各林区，对生长缓慢、木材产量低、经济价值不高的天然次生林，采取了积极措施，展开了改造工作，力求林木快速丰产。
    天水地区原有珍贵茂密的森林区，但经过历代反动统治阶级的摧残破坏，大部形成秃岭荒山和残林迹地，水土流失严重，自然灾害频临，广大群众过着饥寒交迫的悲惨生活。解放后，群众在党的领导下，贯彻了“吃山养山”和“护林中生产，生产中护林”的政策，进行封养保育，基本上改变了旧社会遗留下来的山穷水尽的贫困面貌，使支离破碎的残林迹地又重新恢复了青春。如武山县经过几年的封养保育，已经恢复起来的天然次生林达七十余万亩，比解放前增加一倍还多，木材蓄积量由原来的三万立米增加到三十万立米，有效地控制了水土流失，促进了山区生产的发展。但是所恢复起来的森林，毕竟还是些天然次生林，存在着许多缺陷。突出表现为林木生长缓慢、蓄积量小；产量低、材质不良；地力和空间得不到充分利用；防护作用小；不能满足工农业大跃进的需要。因此，天水地区的广大林区群众1959年春天又以不断革命的精神掀起了一个以抚育、改造、利用为中心的建设次生林区的新高潮。
    为了实现天然次生林的快速丰产，天水各林区首先在无林地、疏林地和杂灌木林地内栽植了生长快、产量高的珍贵树种，贯彻了“全面开发全面利用”的方针，并提出了“八改四利用”和“一化三提高”的行动措施和奋斗目标。“八改”就是：无林改有林；疏林改密林；灌木改乔林；杂木林改经济林；矮林改中林；萌芽林改实生林；单纯林改混合林；单层林改复层林。“四利用”就是：将改造次生林时砍伐下来的杂灌木，加工各种板材、农具、木炭、纤维板、纸浆和各种林化产品。“一化三提高”就是天然次生林改造以后，达到园林化的目标；并提高木材产量和质量；提高林地利用率；提高森林防护作用。
    天水各林区改造次生林的工作已取得了巨大的成效。在改造过的地区，速生而珍贵的幼苗都已茂密的成长起来，成活率一般都在90％以上。武山县滩歌林区结合改造工作充分利用森林资源，到9月底已生产原木一千二百七十四立方米、板材一百三十立方米、各种农具二千多件、木炭数万斤、醋酸三百斤、薪柴十五万斤。仅薪炭一项就能完全补偿改造的支出，有力的支援了工农业生产，并使群众增加了收入。
    目前天水各地群众正总结1959年改造次生林的经验，采取绿化与改造并举的办法，为实现山山戴绿帽，坡坡穿青袍，次生林丰产化，大地园林化的伟大任务而奋斗。
