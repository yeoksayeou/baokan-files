(Reported from Nanjing on January 25th) The state-owned Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory, which was awarded the title of National Advanced Collective, adopts various forms to impart technology to farmers based on the specific conditions in rural areas. Their slogan is: Machines Arrive, People Arrive, Technology Arrives, Ensuring Every Machine Runs Well. In the past year or so, they have directly trained a total of 2,550 diesel engine drivers for rural areas, powerfully supporting agricultural technical transformation.

The output of diesel engines from the Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory has increased substantially year by year. In 1959, in order to adapt to the needs after rural communization, the workers manufactured 3,350 diesel engines with 173,900 horsepower without increasing equipment or personnel, which is equivalent to 2.2 times that of 1958 and close to the total output of the ten years from 1949 to 1958. Most of these diesel engines are supplied for agricultural irrigation and drainage and water conservancy projects.

Since the rural technical force could not keep up with the needs of development, some places lacked skilled diesel engine drivers, and the diesel engines could not be fully utilized, and some were even damaged after being used for a short time. The factory's Party committee proposed to cultivate technical forces for the countryside and impart technology to the farmers. At that time, some people did not agree with this idea. They said: The higher authorities only assigned production targets and did not assign targets for cultivating technical forces for the countryside. Production is so busy, why should we look for trouble? The factory's Party committee criticized this idea of "only caring about manufacturing and not caring about use," and emphasized that if rural diesel engine operators were not trained and technology was not imparted, even if the production plan was overfulfilled, it would only be equivalent to completing half of the task. The factory transferred more than a dozen technicians and technical personnel to strengthen and enrich the "user service group," which is responsible for imparting technology to the countryside and serving users.

The Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory has many methods of imparting technology to farmers. The first method is to "deliver it to the door" and run training classes in the countryside. These training classes are mostly held in seasons when diesel engines are not heavily used. In the past year or so, they have successively sent technicians to areas where machines are used, such as Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Jiangsu, to run training classes. Last summer, the two autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia and Ningxia used their diesel engines for the first time. The factory sent technician Wang Degen, Huang Changmao, and technician Wang Zhenhan to form a mobile service team to teach technology to Mongolian and Hui farmers in these two autonomous regions. They braved the hot weather, carrying more than 20 kilograms of tools, sometimes climbing mountains and ridges, and sometimes trekking in the desert. Batches of young farmers and herdsmen understood the basic knowledge of diesel engines, and were able to start, disassemble, assemble, and troubleshoot common faults.

The second method is to invite farmers to come to the factory for training. The farmers who come to the factory to study mainly participate in assembling machines in the assembly workshop, so that they are familiar with each part, and at the same time, they attend classes to learn some basic principles and structures of diesel engines. The teaching materials are compiled by workers and technicians who often visit and repair machines in the countryside, based on the problems often encountered in the countryside. The content is simple and concise, easy to understand. Yan Xiaochang and He Yongyuan, young farmers from Changshu County, studied in the factory for a period of time last year, and have now become excellent driver leaders in the commune, and also serve as teachers to train new drivers.

The third method is "correspondence courses." The factory regularly publishes "Technical Communications" as supplementary reading materials for rural drivers. In addition to introducing the basic principles and structure of diesel engines, "Technical Communications" also proposes solutions to problems encountered by farmers in use and exchanges experiences. Eleven issues have been published so far, with a total of more than 25,000 copies printed, which are very popular among rural diesel engine drivers.

The factory also regularly sends technicians to the countryside to visit, helping to repair machines and imparting technology at the same time.

These activities of the Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory have not only further strengthened the relationship between workers and peasants, but also spread the advanced ideas of the working class. The diesel engines produced can also be fully utilized. A diesel engine manufactured in 1958 in Geqiao, Wuxi, has been used for more than 8,000 hours without damaging any parts.

    下乡办训练班　请农民来厂学习　出版通俗读物
    满腔热情给农民传授技术
    无锡柴油机厂一年多培养了两千多名柴油机司机
    本报南京25日电　荣获全国先进集体称号的国营无锡柴油机厂，根据农村具体情况，采取多种形式，将技术传授给农民。他们的口号是：机到、人到、技术到，台台机器开动好。最近一年多来，他们直接为农村培养的操纵柴油机的司机共二千五百五十名，有力地支援了农业技术改造。
    无锡柴油机厂的柴油机产量年年大幅度地增长。1959年为适应农村公社化以后的需要，职工们在不增设备不增人的情况下，制造柴油机三千三百五十台、十七万三千九百马力，相当于1958年的二点二倍，接近1949年到1958年十年产量的总和。这些柴油机大部分是供应农业排灌和水利工地上应用的。
    由于农村技术力量跟不上发展的需要，有些地方缺乏熟练的柴油机司机，柴油机不能充分发挥作用，有的甚至使用不久就被损坏。工厂党委便提出要为农村培养技术力量，将技术传授给农民。当时有些人思想不通。他们说：上级只交生产指标，没有交为农村培养技术力量的指标。生产这样忙，为什么要自找麻烦？厂党委批判了这种“管造不管用”的思想，强调如果不培养农村柴油机手，不传授技术，即使生产计划超额完成，也只等于完成一半任务。工厂抽调了十多个技术工人和技术人员，加强和充实了“用户服务组”，负责向农村传授技术，为用户服务。
    无锡柴油机厂向农民传授技术的方法很多。第一种是“送上门”，到农村开办训练班。这种训练班多半是在柴油机使用不多的季节举办。一年多来，他们已先后派技术人员到内蒙古、山西和江苏等使用机器的地区举办过训练班。去年夏天，内蒙古和宁夏两个自治区第一次使用他们生产的柴油机。厂内派了技术工人王德根、黄长茂和技术员王振汉三人组成流动服务组，到这两个自治区分别向蒙族、回族农民传授技术。他们冒着炎热的天气，背着二十多斤重的工具，有时翻山越岭，有时跋涉在沙漠地带。成批青年农牧民懂得了柴油机的基本知识，作到了会开，会拆，会装，会排除一般故障。
    第二种方法是邀请农民上门，在厂里培训。来厂学习的农民主要在装配车间参加装配机器，使他们熟悉每个零件，同时上课学习一些柴油机的基本原理、结构等理论知识。教材是由经常到农村访问和检修机器的工人、技术人员，根据在农村经常遇到的问题编写的。内容简单扼要，深入浅出。常熟县的青年农民严小昌、何永源去年在厂里学习了一个时期，现在已经成为公社里优秀的司机长，并且担任老师培训新司机。
    第三种方法是“函授”。这个厂经常出版“技术通讯”，作为农村司机的补充读物。“技术通讯”上除介绍柴油机基本原理、结构外，还针对农民使用中碰到的问题，提出解决办法，交流使用经验。现在已出版了十一期，共印发了二万五千多份，很受农村柴油机司机的欢迎。
    这个厂还经常派技术工人下乡访问，一面帮助检修机器，一面传授技术。
    无锡柴油机厂的这些活动，既进一步密切了工人和农民之间的关系，又传播了工人阶级的先进思想。出厂的柴油机也能充分发挥作用了。无锡葛埭桥有一台1958年制造的柴油机，已经使用了八千多小时，没有损坏任何零件。
