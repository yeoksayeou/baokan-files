Xinhua News Agency, 30th — In 1959, more than 3,000 professional art troupes in our country further strengthened their adherence to the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. They not only toured large, medium, and small cities but also went deep into factories, mines, rural areas, and military units to bring performances to their doorsteps. This played a significant role in boosting production enthusiasm, meeting the cultural needs of the masses, and promoting amateur cultural activities among the masses. The art workers themselves also gained fruitful results in transforming their ideology and improving their ideological and artistic levels.

In 1959, the performances of professional theatrical troupes achieved greater popularity. In Anhui Province, forty professional theatrical troupes performed 5,250 shows in the mountains and rural areas, factories, and military companies within ten months, accounting for more than 33% of the total number of performances. In the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, five regional-level theatrical troupes performed in the mountains and rural areas, accounting for 50% of the total number of performances throughout the year. The Wuhan Opera House traveled to more than 50 counties in the province. In Henan, Gansu, Hunan, and other provinces, many county theatrical troupes spent 70% to 80% of their time touring below. Many moving examples of enthusiastic service to workers, peasants, and soldiers have emerged in various places. The Hebei Bangzi Opera Troupe of Shijiazhuang Prefecture specially formed a deep-mountain performance team. In 44 days, they walked more than 300 li, crossed more than a dozen mountains, and performed 68 shows, allowing more than 60,000 audiences in the mountainous areas to see their performances. The Qinghai Peking Opera Troupe went twice to the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, thousands of miles away, to perform for the Tibetan compatriots and stationed troops there.

Many professional art troupes, while touring in the mountains and rural areas, relied on the local Party committees, closely combined with the central work, and locally compiled and performed programs for propaganda, which inspired the production enthusiasm of the masses. The Guoyang Dazhong Bangzi Opera Troupe of Anhui Province performed more than 200 shows in the countryside, most of which were in the fields and construction sites, drawing materials locally and compiling and performing the heroic and model deeds of the local area, which received great propaganda effect.

Everywhere, professional literary and art workers, on the one hand, toured the mountains and rural areas, and on the other hand, actively participated in labor and enthusiastically guided the amateur literary and art activities of the masses. This not only strengthened the relationship with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, promoted the literary and art activities of the masses, and enriched the sources of creation, but also yielded particularly great gains in ideological transformation.

    三千多专业艺术团体深入工厂农村部队
    为工农兵服务  把戏送上门
    据新华社30日讯　我国三千多个专业艺术团体在1959年进一步坚定地执行为工农兵服务的方针，不仅在大中小城市巡回演出，更深入厂矿、农村、部队把戏送上门去，对鼓舞生产干劲、满足群众文化生活需要、推动群众业余文艺活动等，起了显著作用；艺术工作者自己在改造思想和提高思想水平、创作水平方面也获得了丰硕的收获。
    1959年专业剧团的演出达到了更大的普及。安徽省四十个专业剧团在十个月内，上山下乡、下厂矿、下连队演出五千二百五十场，占演出总场次33％以上。宁夏回族自治区有五个区级剧团上山下乡演出的场次，占到全年总场次的50％。武汉市歌剧院的足迹遍及省内五十多个县。河南、甘肃、湖南等省不少县剧团有70％到80％的时间在下面巡回演出。各地出现了许多热心为工农兵服务的动人事例。石家庄专区河北梆子剧团特地组成深山演出队，在四十四天中步行三百多里，翻过十几座大山，演出六十八场，使山区六万多观众看到了他们的戏。青海省京剧团曾两次到两千里之遥的玉树藏族自治州，为那里的藏胞和驻军演出。
    许多专业艺术团体在上山下乡巡回演出中，依靠当地党委，紧密结合中心工作，就地编演节目进行宣传，鼓舞了群众的生产干劲。安徽省涡阳大众梆子剧团在农村演出的二百多场中，大部分是深入田间、工地，就地取材，编演当地的英雄模范事迹，收到很大的宣传效果。
    各地专业文艺工作者一面上山下乡巡回演出，一面积极参加劳动，热情辅导群众业余文艺活动，既密切了和工农群众的关系，推动了群众文艺活动，丰富了创作泉源，在思想改造方面收获尤大。
