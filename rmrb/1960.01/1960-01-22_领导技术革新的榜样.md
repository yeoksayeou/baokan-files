    Leading Technological Innovation: A Role Model
    The Party branch is the fighting fortress of all work. The Party branch of the Xiangtan City Wood Factory played this role in technological innovation and the technological revolution, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command.
    "Carpenters can only work with planes and axes," and "Master carpenters can't build machines." These are old ideas and old habits of many years. The Party branch of the Xiangtan Wood Factory educated the Communist Party members to lead the masses in breaking these conservative ideas with practical actions, and to display the spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to do, and perseverance.
    Since the factory had no machines, the Party members took the lead in vigorously carrying out technological innovation and tried to make them themselves. Without planers, the Party members carried extremely heavy iron bars and ground them on grinding wheels. When some people could not persist in using new tools and new machines, the Party branch specifically analyzed the new ideological problems and practical problems encountered, relying on Party members to lead by example and on meticulous care and help for the masses to solve the problems. Later, when the argument that "the technological revolution has reached its peak" was discovered, the Party branch promptly organized discussions. The Party members continued to unite the masses, persisted to the end, and pushed the movement to a new climax.
    At present, a vigorous upsurge of technological innovation and technological revolution is being launched everywhere. How should Party branches and Party members play a leading and promoting role? The Xiangtan City Wood Factory has set a good example for everyone.

    领导技术革新的榜样
    党支部是一切工作的战斗堡垒，湘潭市木工厂党支部在技术革新和技术革命中同样发挥了这个作用，作到了政治挂帅。
    “木工只能用刨子、斧头干活”、“木匠师傅不能造机器”。这是多少年来的旧思想、旧习惯。湘潭木工厂的党支部，教育共产党员们带领群众用实际行动打破了这种保守思想，发挥了敢想、敢说、敢做和坚韧不拔的精神。
    厂里没有机器，党员们带头大搞技术革新，自己来试制。没有刨床，党员们抬着极笨重的铁走条，在砂轮上磨。当有些人不能坚持使用新工具、新机器的时候，党支部就具体分析遇到的新的思想问题和实际问题，依靠党员以身作则，和对群众无微不至的关怀和帮助，解决了问题。后来发现了“技术革命已经到顶”的论调，党支部就及时组织了讨论。党员继续团结群众坚持到底，把运动推向新的高潮。
    当前到处掀起了轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命的热潮，党支部和党员们应当怎样起领导和促进作用呢？湘潭市木工厂给大家作出了好榜样。
