Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 25th: The Japanese "Red Flag" published an editorial today stating that the Japanese people's struggle against the ratification and for the abolition of the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, for the peaceful independence of Japan, and for the establishment of friendly relations with the Soviet Union, China, and other neighboring countries must continue until final victory is achieved.

The editorial said that Nobusuke Kishi, amidst the strong protests of the Japanese people, slipped out of Japan to the United States to sign the military alliance treaty and was praised by U.S. imperialism. Now he has returned to Japan in an attempt to force the Diet to ratify this aggressive treaty and force the Japanese people to walk a very dangerous path.

The newspaper said that the people of Asia and the world regard the military alliance treaty concluded by Kishi and the United States as putting the brutal Japanese militarism in the clothing of the more vicious U.S. imperialism, and the people of Asia and the world express strong anger about this.

The editorial emphasized that just as Nobusuke Kishi returned home, the Japanese people's struggle against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and demanding the resignation of the Kishi Cabinet further set off a climax. Within Japan, apart from the Kishi group and a small handful of extreme reactionaries, no one actively supports this treaty.

The editorial pointed out that the international wave of condemnation against the Kishi government shows that the policy of the Kishi Cabinet, which is subordinate to the United States, is isolated and at the same time means that the Japanese people's struggle against the Kishi Cabinet's implementation of anti-people and anti-national policies has received the support and encouragement of the broad masses of people internationally. The newspaper pointed out that the struggle of the Japanese people will surely achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 23rd: The "Security Treaty Problem Research Association," composed of Japanese writers, scholars, and commentators, decided today to contact many groups opposing the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to further launch a movement against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The Research Association will hold speeches and launch a signature campaign, distribute postcards against the treaty, and produce and sell badges to raise funds for the movement against the treaty. It will also issue appeals to the people of Asia and Africa.

The group also issued a statement saying that in order to fulfill the obligations of the Japanese people, it will resolutely oppose the ratification of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Xinhua News Agency: When commenting on the newly signed U.S.-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security," the American "Time" magazine admitted that this treaty "may become his (Nobusuke Kishi's) political tombstone."

The magazine said that due to the signing of the new treaty, "Japan and the United States have every hope of standing together in the Pacific for many years to come." It boasted that this treaty may become Nobusuke Kishi's "monument." However, in view of the unpopularity of this treaty, the magazine had to express concern that "it is not very certain how long Nobusuke Kishi will continue to serve as prime minister." It said that the Liberal Democratic Party is mainly an alliance of eight major factions, and the leaders of each faction "are like a pack of wolves. If Kishi is injured, others will smell blood and squeeze in to howl, hoping to get some benefits." It said, "In the fierce Japanese political strife, it (the new treaty) may also become his political tombstone."

The "New York Daily News" also expressed similar concerns, writing: "As long as Japan has a pro-American prime minister like Nobusuke Kishi who signed this treaty, we don't think there is any danger in this regard. But what if Japan one day has an anti-American prime minister?"

However, "The New York Times" said gleefully that Nobusuke Kishi "rejected the neutrality and neutralism prevalent in Asia," and the new treaty "makes Japan a full-fledged ally of the United States." "The New York Herald Tribune" expressed satisfaction with the bases provided by Japan to the United States, saying, "The strategic value of the Japanese bases is indisputable. The naval facilities used by the United States are the best in the world."

British newspapers pointed out the unpopularity of the U.S.-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" when commenting on the treaty. The "Daily Telegraph" pointed out in a commentary on the 20th that the content of this treaty "has aroused resentment in Japan."

The newspaper said, "It means that Japan will have to pursue a foreign policy consistent with the U.S. foreign policy, including refusing to recognize Communist China. Japanese industrialists believe they are being hindered by the treaty from obtaining the benefits of new Chinese markets."

The newspaper believes that this new treaty is actually nothing more than an "extension of the validity" of the 1951 U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The newspaper emphasized that the new treaty will not eliminate the difficulties faced by the Nobusuke Kishi government.

The "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in Washington pointed out that the new treaty did not give Japan "veto power" over the issue of the United States using bases in Japan. The report said, "The (U.S.) State Department will not commit itself to anything further than stating that it will give great respect to Japan's opinions."

Another influential British newspaper, "The Times," believes that it is "wrong to regard the signing of the new U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' as the beginning of a new era in relations between the two countries." The newspaper pointed out that "there is not much enthusiasm for this treaty among people in Japan."

"The Times" pointed out that the new treaty will put the Japanese government in a position where there is no room for strategic maneuver. The newspaper said that, in the final analysis, Japan's political aspiration is to get rid of the military and economic "support" of the United States.

The French "Combat" published an article on the 19th pointing out that the signing of the new treaty may cause a crisis in the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government. The article said, "The remaining of American troops and materials in Japan constantly aggravates and increases the anti-American sentiment of the Japanese masses."

The "Combat" article pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi's extremely pro-American policy is not only opposed by the broad progressive forces in Japan, but even within Nobusuke Kishi's own Liberal Democratic Party "there is a trend against the Security Treaty, especially the military provisions of the treaty." The article revealed that a group of pro-Nobusuke Kishi government members are considering replacing him after he returns to Tokyo and intend to vote against the ratification of the treaty during the parliamentary debate. The article admitted that the Japanese people "have genuine admiration and sympathy" for the Chinese people.

    赤旗报”发表社论指出
    日本人民的斗争一定胜利
    西方报刊承认日美军事条约不得人心
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本“赤旗报”今天发表社论说，日本人民反对批准和争取废除侵略性的日美军事同盟条约、争取日本和平独立以及要求同苏联和中国等邻国建立友好关系的斗争一定要继续进行，直到取得最后胜利为止。
    社论说，岸信介在日本人民强烈的抗议声中溜出日本到美国去签订了军事同盟条约，受到美帝国主义的赞扬，他现在又回到日本，是企图迫使国会批准这项侵略性的条约，强迫日本人民走非常危险的道路。
    这家报纸说，亚洲和世界各国人民把岸信介同美国缔结的军事同盟条约，看作是残暴的日本军国主义套上了更加凶恶的美帝国主义的衣服，亚洲和世界各国人民对此表示强烈的愤怒。
    社论强调说，正当岸信介回国的时候，日本人民反对批准新“安全条约”和要求岸信介内阁下台的斗争进一步掀起了高潮。在日本国内，除了岸信介集团和一小撮极端的反动分子以外，是没有人积极支持这项条约的。
    社论指出，国际性的谴责岸信介政府的抗议浪潮表明，从属于美国的岸信介内阁的政策是孤立的，同时意味着日本人民反对岸信介内阁执行反人民、反民族的政策的斗争受到了国际上广大人民的支持和鼓舞。这家报纸指出，日本人民的斗争一定能取得最后胜利。
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：由日本作家、学者、评论家等组成的“安全条约问题研究会”今天决定要同很多反对修改日美“安全条约”的团体取得联系，进一步展开反对日美军事同盟条约的运动。
    研究会将举行演说和展开签名运动，散发反对这个条约的明信片，并且制作和销售徽章来筹集反对这个条约运动的资金。它还要向亚非各国人民发出呼吁。
    这个团体还发表声明说，为了完成日本人民的义务，要坚决反对批准日美军事同盟条约。
    新华社讯　美国“时代”周刊在评论刚签订的美日“共同合作和安全条约”时承认，这个条约“可能成为他（岸信介）的政治墓碑”。
    这家周刊说，由于新条约的签订，“日本和美国完全有希望在今后许多年在太平洋站在一起”。它吹嘘这个条约可能成为岸信介的“纪念碑”。但是，鉴于这条约的不得人心，这家周刊又不得不表示担心，“岸信介将继续担任首相多久，还不十分肯定”。它说，自由民主党主要是一个由八个主要派系组成的联盟，各个派系的领袖“好像一群狼，如果岸信介受伤，其他人闻到血味就会挤进来吼叫，希望得到一些好处”。它说，“在激烈的日本政争中，它（新条约）也可能成为他的政治墓碑。”
    “纽约每日新闻”也表示了类似的担心，它写道：“只要日本有一个像签订这个条约的岸信介这样亲美的首相，我们认为，这方面没有什么危险。但是如果日本某一天有了一个反美首相，那将怎样呢？”
    但是，“纽约时报”得意地说，岸信介“拒绝了亚洲盛行的中立和中立主义”，新条约“使日本成为美国的一个十足的盟国”。“纽约先驱论坛报”对日本为美国提供的基地表示满意，它说，“日本基地的战略价值是无可争论的。美国所利用的那些海军设备是世界上最好的。”
    英国报纸在评论美日“共同合作和安全条约”时指出了这个条约不得人心。“每日电讯报”20日在评论中指出，这项条约的内容在日本国内“激起了愤慨情绪”。
    报纸说，“它意味着，日本将不得不奉行同美国外交政策一致的外交政策，其中包括拒绝承认共产党中国在内。日本的工业家们认为他们受到了条约的阻挠，不让他们取得新的中国市场的好处。”
    报纸认为，这项新的条约实际上不过是1951年日美“安全条约”的“效力的延长而已”。报纸强调指出，新条约不会使岸信介政府面临的困难得到消除。
    “每日电讯报”驻华盛顿记者指出，新的条约并没有给日本在美国使用基地问题上的“否决权”。报道说，“（美国）国务院将不会使它自己承担比空谈它将对日本的意见给予很大尊重更进一步的责任。”
    另一家英国有影响的报纸“泰晤士报”认为，把新的日美“安全条约”的签订看成是“两国之间关系的新时期的开始是错误的”，报纸指出，“在日本国内人们对这个条约没有什么热情”。
    “泰晤士报”指出，新条约将使日本政府处于在策略上没有回旋余地的地位。报纸说，归根到底，日本的政治愿望是希望摆脱美国的军事和经济的“支持”。
    法国“战斗报”19日载文指出，新条约的签订可能引起日本岸信介政府的危机。文章说，“美国军队和物资的留在日本，不断地加剧和增加日本群众的反美情绪。”
    “战斗报”的文章指出，岸信介极端亲美的政策不但遭到日本广大进步力量的反对，甚至在岸信介自己的自由民主党内“也存在着反对安全条约特别是条约的军事性规定的潮流”。文章透露，一批亲岸信介政府的议员正在考虑待他回到东京以后撤换他，并且打算在议会辩论批准这项条约时投票反对。文章承认，日本人民对中国人民“怀有真实的敬佩和同情。”
