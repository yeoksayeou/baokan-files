    Safe and Unsafe
    Gan Dehao
    Nobusuke Kishi sat in his official residence, sighing to himself: Not revising the "Security Treaty" was still safe, but revising the "Security Treaty" caused public uproar. The power of the eleven unified actions is boundless. Protest letters fly in like snowflakes, and the sound of protest grows fiercer like flames. The people of the world know very well: if this earth had no imperialism, it would be very safe for the people of all countries to get along. Vampires stir up trouble all day long, and warmongers engage in the Cold War all year round, making the world unsafe everywhere. Once upon a time, there was a familiar fable: a vicious wolf, wanting to eat children, would first put on a human face and pretend to smile. Now the jackals of the United States and Japan, colluding together to break into other people's homes, sign a bloody treaty but call it "security." No matter how sweet the wolf grandma's words are, she can't hide a tail sticking out. People are raising wolf-slaying knives to tear apart their faces!

    安全和不安全
    甘德豪岸信介在相府自思自叹：不修订“安全条约”倒还安全，一修订“安全条约”人民哗然。十一次统一行动威力无边，抗议书连翩飞来就像雪片，抗议声越来越猛就像火焰。世界人民心里很清楚：如果这地球没有帝国主义，各国人民相处就很安全。吸血鬼整天兴风作浪，战争贩子整年在搞冷战，弄得世界上到处都不安全。从前有个大家很熟悉的寓言：狠心狼要想吃孩子，就先扮作人相装起笑脸。如今美国和日本的豺狼，勾结起来想闯进别人的家园，签订个血腥的条约却叫“安
  全”。狼外婆尽管蜜语甜言，藏不住一条尾巴露在外边，人们高举宰狼刀要撕碎它们的
  嘴脸！
