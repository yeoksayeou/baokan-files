The people of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces and regions, promoting the communist spirit, are breaking down provincial and sectoral boundaries to carry out socialist cooperation and jointly expedite the construction of the Yaojie Coal Mine's special railway line.

(From our newspaper in Lanzhou) The Yaojie special line is one of the key projects of Gansu Province. Branching off from the Haishiawan Station of the Lanqing Railway, it follows the Datong River, clinging to the mountains and hugging the water, passing through dangerous areas such as "Yan Wang's Nose" and "Ghost Gate Pass" before reaching the Yaojie mining area. Once this line is completed, it can promptly supply the coal urgently needed by the Lanzhou industrial zone. Although the entire line is only a dozen kilometers long, the project is extremely arduous, with bridges and tunnels accounting for more than 26% of the total length of the railway. Since construction began in May 1959, less than 10% of the entire project had been completed by the end of October. The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to organize large-scale cooperation across the province to expedite the construction of this line.

As soon as the news spread, neighbors near and far, from all directions, broke down the boundaries between provinces and industries and joined forces to support the construction of this railway. The Xining Railway Bureau of Qinghai Province transferred skilled workers in tunnel excavation and track laying and bridge building, concentrated the best construction machinery, and sent them under the leadership of three division-level cadres to provide support. The Urumqi Railway Bureau of Xinjiang supported a batch of tents and tungsten steel drill bits. The Lanzhou Railway Bureau transferred workers and leading cadres with rich experience in tunnel engineering from Jingshan. The Dingxi Special District Road Construction Corps transferred more than 5,000 outstanding laborers from the railway branch line from Baiyin City to Baojishan, and sent a deputy commissioner to lead them to provide support. Factories in Baiyin City, which had never built railways before, transferred a group of workers with blasting skills and brought their own cars, air compressors, and wind drills to participate in the battle. The Liujiaxia Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau transferred more than 300 stonemasons and supported a large number of wind drills. The Yintao Engineering Bureau selected 204 blasters, a large portion of whom were advanced producers. The Gansu Provincial Department of Transportation equipped the project with newly manufactured vehicles. The Gansu Provincial Materials Bureau and the commercial departments of Gansu Province and Lanzhou City opened their warehouses and gave priority to supplying materials. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army vacated barracks for the laborers to live in and also supported some construction machinery. Many commercial personnel, bank staff, and medical personnel also rushed to the construction site to serve the road construction workers.

This labor army, guided by the idea of communist cooperation, worked hard and cleverly for more than two months, supporting each other, which rapidly advanced the Yaojie Coal Mine's special railway. Currently, the Dawan Tunnel project has been completed 98%; except for the newly added Datong River Bridge, the large and small bridges and culverts have been basically completed; and more than 90% of the 1.3 million cubic meters of earth and stone work has been completed.

    甘肃青海新疆人民发扬共产主义精神
    三省区协作赶修窑街专用线
    本报兰州讯　甘肃、青海、新疆三个省、区的人民打破省界和行业的界限，开展社会主义大协作，共同抢修窑街煤矿专用铁路线。
    窑街专用线是甘肃省的重点工程之一。从兰青铁路的海石湾车站分岔，沿大通河依山傍水而上，穿过“阎王鼻”、“鬼门关”等险要地带，直达窑街矿区。这条路修通以后，可以及时供应兰州工业区急需的煤炭。全线虽然只有十几公里，但是工程十分艰险，桥涵、隧道占铁路全长的26％以上。1959年5月开工以来，到10月底还没有完成全部工程的10％。中共甘肃省委决定在全省组织大协作，抢修这条线路。
    消息传开，左邻右舍，四面八方，打破省界和行业之间的界限，群起支援这条铁路的建设。青海省的西宁铁路局抽调开挖隧道和铺轨架桥的熟练工人，集中最好的施工机械，由三个处长级干部带领前来支援。新疆的乌鲁木齐铁路局支援了一批帐篷和钨钢钻头。兰州铁路局从镜铁山抽调对隧道工程有丰富经验的工人和领导干部。定西专区筑路兵团从白银市至宝积山的铁路支线上，抽调了五千多名优秀民工，并派一个副专员领导前来支援。从来没有修过铁路的白银市的工厂抽调了一批掌握爆破技能的工人，自带汽车、空气压缩机和风钻等设备前来参战。刘家峡水利工程局调来三百多名石工，并且支援了大批风钻。引洮工程局选拔来二百零四名爆破手，其中很大一部分是先进生产者。甘肃省交通厅为这一工程配备了新出厂的汽车。甘肃省物资局和甘肃省、兰州市的商业部门打开仓库大门，优先供应物资。人民解放军某部腾出营房让民工住，还支援了一些施工机械。许多商业人员、银行工作人员和医务人员，也赶来工地为筑路工人服务。
    这支在共产主义协作思想指导下的劳动大军，经过两个多月的苦干巧干，互相支援，使窑街煤矿专用铁路有了迅速的进展。现在，大湾隧道工程已经完成98％；除新增加的大通河大桥以外，大小桥涵已经基本完成；一百三十多万方土石方工程已经完成90％以上。（附图片）
