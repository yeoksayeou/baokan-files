	Pig Raising Rhyme
		The commune is busy raising pigs,
		Building pig pens, constructing pig houses,
		One fat pig produces ten thousand catties of manure,
		Ten thousand catties of manure for a thousand catties of grain.
		The commune's fat pigs are big,
		Bring a large scale, but it can't weigh them,
		The pig farm director, everyone praises,
		Praising him for loving the commune as his own home.

    养猪谣公社里，养猪忙，砌猪圈，盖猪房，一口肥猪万斤粪，万斤粪呀千斤粮。社里肥猪个儿大，找来大秤称不下，养猪场长人人夸，夸他爱社如爱家。
