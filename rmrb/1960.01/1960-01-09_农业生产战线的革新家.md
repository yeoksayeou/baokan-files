Innovators on the Agricultural Production Front
By our reporter Qu Yifan

Determined to be a "Michurin"
Wang Shizhong of the Xinjing Production Team of the Jiuzhen Commune in Tianmen County, Hubei Province, is called "Little Michurin" by the local people. This is because he cultivated a peculiar type of rice—it can regenerate in alternate years, and one root produces several to dozens of ears, each bearing three to four hundred large grains. In 1958, Wang Shizhong grafted twenty artemisia plants with rice, and twenty of them survived. In the same year, each root grew two to three ears, each ear averaging four hundred and twenty to four hundred and eighty grains, with full kernels, about one-tenth heavier than ordinary rice grains. In 1959, the grafted artemisia stalks turned green again in the spring breeze and grew new seedlings. These new seedlings had an even stronger tillering ability, each root growing forty or more ears, each ear bearing four hundred and eighty to five hundred and twenty grains. The rice seeds harvested from the grafted seedlings in 1958, when sown last year, also grew rice, with each root tillering two to three ears, each ear bearing three hundred to four hundred grains. Now, Wang Shizhong has preserved all the new and old stalks and the newly harvested seeds, preparing to continue cultivation and observation experiments this year. If this perennial new rice variety is successfully cultivated, it will not only greatly increase the rate of rice production, but also save a lot of labor in seedling cultivation and transplanting.

Wang Shizhong, this young man, is now the branch secretary of the Communist Youth League in the Xinjing Production Team. In recent years, under the leadership and education of the Party, he has fully demonstrated his daring, pioneering, and boldly innovative communist style. In addition to experimenting with grafting rice with artemisia, he also experimented with hybridizing rice with sorghum and reeds, sunflowers with Jerusalem artichokes, soybeans with peanuts, cotton and peppers with paper mulberry... He has experimented with more than forty projects of sexual and asexual hybridization, and more than twenty have shown results.

Wang Shizhong only attended winter school for two seasons, but his perseverance in diligent study is astonishing. Over the past decade since liberation, he has persisted in self-study in his spare time. He has now completed the main courses of junior and senior high school, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and language, and has studied Michurin's botany. He is currently starting to study university physics and botany on his own. At the same time, he is also concerned about politics and always diligently studies political theory. Every day, he is busy with production experiments and League work during the day, and in the evening, he participates in various meetings of the production team, the Communist Youth League, or the experimental group. After returning home late at night, he still insists on studying for two hours every night without interruption. In addition, he also makes friends with technical cadres from the county and commune agricultural science institutes, as well as teachers and students from middle schools, and often takes the initiative to ask them to help solve difficult problems in experimental research and study.

Answering a hundred "whys?"
The Dongfeng Production Team of the Bailian Commune in Guanghua County, Hubei Province, has established an agricultural experimental field. This experimental field has cotton, as well as wheat, corn and other crops. He Lizhong, the Party branch secretary of the Dongfeng Team, is the leader and researcher of this experimental field.

In 1958, He Lizhong led the establishment of an experimental team of twenty-four people. In the twelve mu of cotton experimental land, according to the growth characteristics of cotton and the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, they boldly raised a hundred "whys?" Who will answer them? They found the answers one by one in their own scientific experiments. They conducted a total of eighteen experimental projects, including variety, deep plowing, fertilization, and close planting. Each experimental project was divided into several different treatments, for a total of one hundred and eight treatment method experiments. They also closely integrated experimental research with large-field production, and constantly disseminated and promoted successful experimental experiences to large-field production, striving for large-area balanced increase in cotton production. In 1959, although they suffered a hundred days of severe drought, they created a new high-yield record for the county of 673 jin of seed cotton per mu in 130 mu of cotton fields and 1,040 jin of seed cotton per mu in 3.5 mu of high-yield fields. Now, He Lizhong has raised new "whys?" in cotton production. He is actively experimenting and researching how to further solve the new problems of cotton boll shedding and eliminating insect pests.

He also constantly raises many questions about the potential of the land and the cropping system, and explores new tricks for increasing production with his own labor and wisdom. What is most interesting to people is his experiment of rational rotation and intercropping, turning fields that could only be harvested once or twice a year into fields that yield crops in all four seasons. One mu and two fen of land harvested five kinds of crops in a year, and the annual output value per mu reached more than 670 yuan, equivalent to the income of ten mu of land. According to his experience, the whole team promoted multiple cropping (harvesting three or four seasons) on 120 mu of land in 1959. The average yield of the first season of wheat was 410 jin per mu. Corn was intercropped in the wheat field, yielding 350 jin per mu (due to the drought affecting the yield), and radishes were intercropped between the corn rows, yielding another 2,500 jin per mu. In this way, the yield of one mu was more than equivalent to three mu of land.

Xu Guoying and the "Mobile Seedling Beds"
Have you ever seen such seedling beds? During the day, wherever there is sunshine, it moves to bask in the sun; at night, it returns to the warm bed in the house to keep warm. This is the "mobile seedling bed" of Xu Guoying, the director of the Women's Federation of the Qinglong Management Area of the Qinglong Commune in Anlu County, Hubei Province. She led a "Red Xia Girls' High-Yield Experimental Group" and won new records of "thousand-jin high yield" for early rice, middle rice, single-season late rice, and cotton last year. Among them, the "mobile seedling bed" made great contributions to the thousand-jin per mu yield of early rice. Early sowing and early seedling cultivation are the first hurdle to achieve high yield of early rice. However, the cold climate of early spring and the frequent attacks of cold waves often wipe out the early sown seedlings. Xu Guoying accepted the past lessons and insisted on continuing to try early sowing. In 1959, she decided to sow early rice seedlings more than a month earlier than the local custom. What to do? She wrapped the soaked grain seeds in cotton wool and incubated them in bed. After germination, the tender shoots emerged. Where to sow? She came up with another idea, using four boxes for carrying wedding cakes (i.e., gift boxes for weddings in rural areas in the old society), lining the bottom of the boxes with grass, spreading a layer of oily sand on the grass, and scattering the grain seeds. This is the "mobile seedling bed" that can be moved freely. The first batch of early strong seedlings, carefully cultivated, were transplanted in 2.2 mu of "chicken-depleted fields" (bad fields), and as a result, more than 2,570 jin of dried grain was harvested.

When Xu Guoying and the group of "Red Xia Girls" she led boldly carried out various technical innovation experiments, they did not know how many criticisms and oppositions they encountered from conservatives. They overcame numerous difficulties and finally created the victory of "thousand-jin high yield." (Attached picture)

Originally, the cucumbers here could only be harvested once a year. After their improvement, they can now be harvested seven times a year. Tang Qianxin (Xinhua News Agency)

    农业生产战线的革新家
    本报记者　曲一凡
    决心做个“米丘林”
    湖北省天门县九真公社新景生产队的王时中，当地群众都管他叫“小米丘林”。因为他曾培育了一种奇异的水稻——它可以隔年再生，而且一条根生出几个到几十个穗，每穗结三、四百个硕大的谷粒。1958年，王时中使二十四根蒿草同水稻嫁接，活了二十根，当年每根长出两三个穗子，每穗平均结粒四百二十到四百八十粒，籽粒很饱满，比普通稻粒约重十分之一。1959年在那些嫁接过的蒿草蔸子上，经春风吹拂又重新发青，长出了新苗。这些新苗的分蘖能力更加旺盛，每根长出四十多穗，每穗结粒四百八十到五百二十粒。从1958年嫁接新苗上收下来的谷种，去年播下种也长出了谷子，每根分蘖二到三穗，每穗结三百粒到四百粒谷。现在，王时中又把所有新、老蔸子和新收的种籽保存着，准备今年继续进行培育和观察试验。如果这个多年生的水稻新品种培育成功，不仅将大大提高稻谷增产速度，并且可以节省许多育苗、插秧的人工。
    王时中这个年青小伙子，现在是新景生产队共青团的分支书记。几年来，他在党的领导和培养教育下，充分发挥了敢想敢干、大胆革新的共产主义风格。他除了试验水稻同蒿草嫁接，还试验用水稻同高粱、芦苇等杂交，向日葵同洋姜杂交，黄豆同花生杂交，棉花、辣椒等同构树嫁接……先后试验的有性杂交和无性杂交共有四十多个项目，已见成效的有二十多项。
    王时中原来只上过两季冬学，但是，他勤学苦钻的毅力十分惊人。解放十年来，他坚持着业余自学，现在已经学完初中和高中的数学、物理、化学和语文等主要课程，并学过了米丘林的植物学，目前正在开始自修大学的物理学、植物学等课程。同时，他也很关心政治，总是勤学不倦地学习政治理论知识。每天，他白天忙于生产试验和团的工作，晚上参加生产队、共青团或试验组的各种会议，深更半夜回到家以后，还坚持每晚两个小时的学习，从不间断。另外，他还同县、公社农业科学研究所的技术干部，以及中学的教师、学生们交朋友，经常主动地请他们帮助解决试验研究和学习中的疑难问题。
    回答一百个“为什么？”
    湖北省光化县白莲公社东风生产队建立了一片农业试验场。这试验场里有棉花，也有小麦、玉米和其他作物。东风队党支部书记何立中就是这个试验场的领导人和研究员。
    1958年，何立中领导成立了一个二十四人的试验队，曾经在十二亩的棉花试验地里，根据棉花生长特性和农业八字宪法，大胆地提出了一百个“为什么？”谁来回答呢？他们在自己的科学试验中一个个地找出了答案。他们共做了品种、深耕、施肥、密植等十八个试验项目，每个试验项目中又分几种不同的处理，总共做了一百零八个处理方法的试验。他们还把试验研究同大田生产密切结合起来，不断地把试验成功的经验，向大田生产传播推广，争取棉花大面积平衡增产。1959年虽然遭到了百日大旱，他们却创造了一百三十亩棉田亩产籽棉六百七十三斤和三亩五分丰产田亩产籽棉一千零四十斤的全县高产新纪录。现在，何立中在棉花生产中，又提出了新的“为什么？”他正在积极试验研究如何进一步解决棉铃脱落和灭绝虫害的新课题。
    对土地的潜力和耕作制度，他也不断地提出许多问题，用自己的劳动和智慧探索新的增产窍门。使人们最感兴趣的是他的合理轮作和间作的试验，把一年只能收一两季的田，变成了一年四季有收成。有一亩二分田，一年收了五样庄稼，每亩年产值达到六百七十多元，相当于十亩田的收益。全队根据他的经验，1959年在一百二十亩田地推行了多种多收（收三季或四季），头季小麦平均每亩产四百一十斤，小麦地里套种玉米，每亩收三百五十斤（因旱影响了产量），玉米行间又套种萝卜，每亩又收了二千五百斤，这样加起来一亩收成抵三亩田有余。
    徐国英和“活动秧田”
    你看见过这样的秧田吗？白天，哪里有太阳，它就搬家去晒太阳；夜晚，它又回到屋里的温床上取暖。这就是湖北省安陆县青龙公社青龙管理区的妇联主任徐国英的“活动秧田”。她领导一个“红霞姑娘丰产试验组”，去年夺取了早稻、中稻、一季晚稻和棉花等四个“千斤丰产”的新纪录。其中，早稻亩产千斤，“活动秧田”是建了大功劳的。早播种、早育秧是争取早稻高产的第一关。可是，早春的寒冷气候和频繁袭击的寒潮，常会把早播的秧苗一扫而光。徐国英接受了过去的教训，坚持继续试行早播。1959年她又决定要比当地习惯提早一个多月下早稻秧。怎么办呢？她把浸好的谷种包在棉絮里，煨在床上，经过催芽，嫩芽冒出来了。往哪里下种呢？她又想出一个办法，用四个抬喜饼的盒子（即旧社会农村办喜事的礼盒），盒底垫上草，草上铺一层油沙土，撒上谷种。这就是那个可以自由移来移去的“活动秧田”。经过精心培育出来的第一批早壮秧，被移植在二亩二分的“鸡耗田”（坏田）里，结果收获了二千五百七十多斤干谷。
    当徐国英和她领导的一群“红霞姑娘”大胆地进行各种技术革新试验时，不知遭到多少保守者的讽刺和反对。她们克服了重重困难，终于创造了“千斤丰产”的胜利。（附图片）
