Fly! Eagles on the Transportation Front
	Suo Bin

	On New Year's Eve, Locomotive No. 5011 of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, illuminated by bright signal lights, proudly left the depot, like a steed ready to go, and stopped at the departure line of Fengtai West Station.

	This young crew, under the leadership of the Party in 1959, safely and comprehensively completed its transportation tasks, saving 420 tons of coal, exceeding the axle load by 120,000 tons, and surpassing the depot's set technical speed targets.

	To fight well in the first battle of a good start, they actively prepared, using the time when the fire was out to thoroughly overhaul and clean the locomotive. After the driver team leader, Tian Jinrong, returned to the depot from attending the broadcast meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League to "Reward Youth for Achievements in Crossing '60'," he organized a group discussion of Comrade Hu Yaobang's report, and their enthusiasm was even greater.

	Today is a tense moment for fighting across the old and new years, and the task must be completed victoriously. Driver Li Wenzhou checked the locomotive again and again. The co-driver, Guo Weimin, shoveled coal into the firebox one shovel at a time. The fireman kept watering the coal bunker with a sprinkler. At this time, there were only a few minutes left before departure, and the air pump exhaust pipe kept spitting out white gas. The three people once again briefly deployed the coordination of operation and firing for this train. Driver Li Wenzhou said: "We are the first train in 1960, the relationship is important, it all depends on us!" The two partners nodded with confidence. At this time, the green departure signal flickered a few times, and the locomotive started up with its head held high. The long train of 3,600 tons left Fengtai West Station like a giant dragon, its speed getting faster and faster. The green signal was particularly beautiful at night, really like a green street. Driver Li Wenzhou looked ahead while looking at the watch; the co-driver took advantage of the increased speed to turn on the coal feeder, and the red needle on the steam gauge pointed to the set pressure without moving, and the train sped forward. It took only one hour and forty minutes from Fengtai to Nancang. After the locomotive arrived at the station and unhooked, it entered the depot. The duty officer of the return section waved the signal and shouted: "Train, we must be especially tight!" After the locomotive turned around, the three of them didn't even eat, and went out of the depot after preparation. The night wind was cold. After Driver Li Wenzhou preheated the cylinders, he told the co-driver to shake the oil a few more times, and carefully checked the firebox, and saw that the arch bricks were burning red.

	After starting, because the uphill was a small uphill, and it was the first time to use the new coal type, the steam and water were a little struggling. The co-driver, Guo Weimin, looked at the firebox and immediately changed the firing method. In view of the characteristics of pulverized coal, the method of frequent shaking and hooking was adopted to maintain a thicker fire layer, which stopped the falling pointer. The driver watched the partner sweating profusely, and watched the steam and water improve, and his heart stabilized.

	At this time, the east was gradually turning white, and when the locomotive passed Langfang Station, the sun had already risen. The three people forgot their fatigue of the night and completed the task of the first train of the 1960 opening red with full spirit and excellent results.

	After returning to the depot, after calculation, the technical speed averaged 59.5 kilometers per hour, which was 4.5 kilometers higher than the depot's set target, saving 1 ton and 622 kilograms of coal, and exceeding the axle by 500 tons. The duty director issued a certificate of "Pacesetter of Opening Red Assault" according to their good completion of the task, and the three people walked out of the operation room with the joy of victors.

    飞吧！运输战线上的雄鹰
    锁斌
    除夕夜，丰台机务段五零一一号机车迎着明亮的信号灯光，雄赳赳地出库了，像一匹整装待发的骏马，停在丰台西站的出发线上。
    这个年轻的包乘组，1959年在党的领导下，安全全面地完成了运输任务，节煤四百二十吨，超轴十二万吨，技速超过了段定指标。
    为打好开门红的第一仗，他们积极做了准备，利用消火的时间，把机车进行了彻底的整修和大清扫。在司机长田金荣参加团中央召开的“奖励青年跨‘六○’有成绩”的广播大会回段后，组织小组讨论了胡耀邦同志的报告，劲头鼓的更足了。
    今天这是骑年跨月战斗的紧张时刻，一定要胜利的完成任务。司机李文舟一次又一次地检查着机车。副司机郭伟民一锹一锹的向火室投着煤。司炉拿着洒水管向煤斗浇个不停。这时，离发车还有几分钟了，风泵废气管不住地吐着白气。三个人又一次简短的部署了这趟车操纵和焚火的配合。司机李文舟说：“咱们是1960年的第一趟车，关系重大，就看咱们的啦！”两个伙计满怀信心的点着头。这时绿色的发车信号晃了几下，机车昂着头起动了。三千六百吨的长大列车像一条巨龙开出了丰台西站，速度一会儿比一会儿高。夜里绿色信号格外好看，真像一条绿街。司机李文舟一边看着前方，一边看着表；副司机趁着速度加快的当儿，便开开了加煤机，汽表上的红针指着定压，一动也不动，列车飞速地向前驶去。丰台到南仓只用了一点四十分。机车到站摘完钩，便进库了。折返段的值班员一边晃着信号，一边喊：“火车，要特别抓紧呀！”机车转完头，三个人连饭都没吃，整备完就出库了。夜里的风冷飕飕的。司机李文舟进行汽缸预热后，告诉副司机多摇了几下油，又详细的查看了火室，只见拱砖烧的红红的。
    开车后，因为上行是小上坡，又是第一次使用新煤种，汽水顶着有点儿吃力。副司机郭伟民看了看火室，便立即改变了焚火方法。针对末煤的特点，采取了勤摇勤勾，保持较厚火层的办法，才止住了下降的指针。司机看着伙计满头的大汗，又看着汽水好转的情景，心才稳定了下来。
    这时，东方渐渐发白，机车过廊坊站时，太阳已经升起来。三个人忘了一夜的疲劳，精神饱满地，出色地完成了1960年开门红第一趟车的任务。
    回段后，一计算，技术速度平均完成五十九点五公里小时，比段订指标提高四点五公里，节煤一吨六百二十二公斤，超轴五百吨。值班主任根据他们完成任务很好，当即发了开门红突击手的奖状，三个人带着胜利者的愉快走出了运转室。
