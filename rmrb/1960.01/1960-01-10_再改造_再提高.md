    Re-transform, Re-improve
    After more than a year of testing, small coal mines, like other small-scale, locally-sourced enterprises, have proven with their own development and growth that they possess vigorous vitality and are an indispensable "leg" in the development of the coal industry.
    Anything, in its initial stages, is small and fragile. However, through continuous transformation, it can be continuously improved, becoming increasingly robust, transforming from small and fragile to strong and solid, from low-level to high-level. Many small coal mines, after technical transformation, have undergone significant changes in their production appearance. Backward manual operations have been transformed into simple, locally-sourced and foreign-combined mechanical operations. Electric lighting has replaced open-flame lighting. Carts, chutes, winches, and rail transport have replaced carrying on shoulders and backs. Production efficiency has been greatly improved, the labor intensity of workers has been greatly reduced, the demand for labor has decreased, costs have been reduced, and the working conditions both above and below ground have been significantly improved. These changes have enabled small coal mines to gain a firm foothold and develop and grow stronger.
    Over the past year, the achievements of technical transformation in small coal mines can only be seen as a victorious start. In the future, it is necessary to continue to adhere to the principle of "overall transformation, key improvement," focusing on locally-sourced methods, prioritizing local methods before foreign ones, and combining local and foreign methods. Perhaps some people may think: locally-sourced transformation, no matter how much it is transformed, is still "local," without any "profit"! The reality is quite the opposite. "Foreign" methods are gradually developed and changed from "local" methods. Without "local," there can be no "foreign." For example, the Jianchuan Sanying Coal Mine initially used ropes to lift coal out of the well, which improved efficiency by one time compared to carrying it on backs. After changing to manual drum lifting, it improved by another time. Then, changing to a locally-made winch improved it by fifteen times. When we look back at the initial carrying on backs and shoulders, the changes between "local" and "local" are already so significant. Seeing that they are now using blasting to dislodge coal and using hand-cranked drilling machines to drill blasting holes for coal mining, hasn't the beautiful prospect of a small coal mine being transformed from local to foreign been vividly displayed?
    Various links within industrial production are interconnected. Changes in the preceding link often require corresponding follow-up in the subsequent link. For example, if the efficiency of underground transport is improved, but ground transport cannot keep up, it will inevitably cause blockages at the wellhead. This requires arrangement in overall planning to ensure that the various links of the transformation are closely linked and more rational. The experience of small coal mine transformation over the past year has also told us that a key to doing a good job in transformation is to have comprehensive planning and unified arrangements, to clarify the relationships between importance and urgency, needs and possibilities, and the present and the long term. Only in this way can we put our efforts in the right place and achieve the greatest results.

### 再改造　再提高

    再改造　再提高
    经过一年多时间的考验，小型煤矿也和其它小土群企业一样，用它自身的发展与壮大的事实，证明了它是具有旺盛的生命力的，是煤炭工业发展中不可缺少的一条“腿”。
    任何一件事物，在它开始萌芽的时候，都是微小而脆弱的。但是，只要通过不断的改造，就能不断地提高，日趋茁壮。由微小、脆弱的，变成强大、坚实的，由低级的变成高级的。许多小煤矿经过技术改造，生产面貌发生了显著的变化，落后的手工操作，变成了简易的、土洋结合的机械操作；电灯照明代替了明火照明；车子、溜槽、绞车、轨道运输代替了肩挑背驮。生产效率大大提高，人的劳动强度大大减轻，劳动力的需要量减少了，成本降低了，井上井下的劳动条件也显著改善了。这些变化，使得小煤矿站稳脚跟，并且能够发展壮大起来。
    过去一年来，小煤矿技术改造的成就还只能看做是胜利的开始，今后还需要继续坚持“全面改造，重点提高”的方针，以土为主、先土后洋、土洋结合。也许有人会想：土法改造改来改去还是一个“土”，没有“油水”！事实却正相反，“洋”都是由“土”逐渐发展改变来的。没有“土”，就不可能有“洋”，如剑川三营煤矿开初用绳索吊煤上井，比人背提高工效一倍，改为手摇滚筒提升后，又提高一倍，再改为土绞车就提高了十五倍。当我们回头来看看开初的人背人驮，就是“土”与“土”之间的变化，已是相差如此之大。再看到他们现在已用爆破落煤，手摇钻机打炮眼采煤的时候，一个小型煤矿经过改造，由土到洋的美丽前景，不是已经生动地展示出来了吗？
    工业生产内部各个环节是彼此相互联系的。往往是前一环节的变动，就必然要求后一环节相应地跟上去，比如井下运输效率提高了，地面运输跟不上，就必然造成井口堵塞等等。这就需要在全面规划中加以安排，使改造的各个环节丝丝相扣，更加合理。一年多来小煤矿的改造经验也告诉了我们：作好改造工作的一个关键，是要有全面的规划和统一的安排，要弄清轻重缓急，需要与可能，目前与长远之间各方面的关系，只有如此，才能把功夫用到点上，收到最大的效果。
