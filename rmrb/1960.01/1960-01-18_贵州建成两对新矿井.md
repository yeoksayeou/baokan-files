Guizhou Province's Lindong Mining Bureau recently completed two pairs of modern mine shafts: the Yanziyan Mine Shaft and the Gaoshengtang Mine Shaft. They have recently been officially put into production.

The Yanziyan Mine Shaft and the Gaoshengtang Mine Shaft were built in October and August of 1958, respectively. Both are inclined shafts with an annual output of 210,000 tons. The entire production process of these two pairs of mine shafts, from mining, transportation, and hoisting to ventilation and drainage, is mechanized. They are two new types of mine shafts with a relatively high degree of mechanization currently put into production in Guizhou Province.

    贵州建成两对新矿井
    贵州省林东矿务局最近建成两对现代化矿井——燕子岩矿井和高生堂矿井。并于最近正式投入生产。
    燕子岩矿井和高生堂矿井分别在一九五八年十月和八月兴建，均为年产二十一万吨的斜井。这两对矿井的整个生产过程，从采掘、运输、提升到通风、排水，都是机械化的，是贵州省当前投入生产机械化较高的两对新型矿井。
