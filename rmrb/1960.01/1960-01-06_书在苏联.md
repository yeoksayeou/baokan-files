    Books in the Soviet Union
    In pre-revolutionary Russia, in the four hundred years since the publication of the first printed book, only 550,000 kinds of books were published in total; while in the forty years after the establishment of the Soviet regime, 1,386,000 kinds of books were published.
    ＊　＊　＊
    In pre-revolutionary Russia, the number of books published in 1913 was 99 million; while in 1958, the number of books published in the Soviet Union reached more than 1 billion.
    ＊　＊　＊
    In the Soviet Union, the number of books printed per capita has increased eightfold compared to the era of Tsarist Russia, and greatly exceeds the number printed in the most developed capitalist countries.

    书在苏联
    在革命前的俄国，自从第一本印刷的书出版以来，四百年中间，总共不过出版五十五万种书；而在苏维埃政权成立后四十年中间，就出版了一百三十八万六千种书。
    ＊　＊　＊
    在革命前的俄国，1913年出版的书籍印数是九千九百万本；而在1958年，苏联出版的书籍印数就达到十亿多本。
    ＊　＊　＊
    在苏联，按每人平均计算，印刷的书籍比沙皇俄国时代增加八倍，而且大大超过最发达的资本主义国家的印数。
