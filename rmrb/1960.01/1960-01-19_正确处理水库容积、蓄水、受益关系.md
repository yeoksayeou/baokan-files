Correctly Handle the Relationship Between Reservoir Capacity, Water Storage, and Benefit
Commentator of This Newspaper

    Based on the continuous leap forward in water conservancy, the Yuxi Special District of Yunnan Province has summarized its years of experience and proposed a method to shorten the distance between capacity, water storage, and benefit, which has achieved remarkable results. This shows that it is very necessary to summarize past experiences to make current water conservancy construction more effective.

    Farmland water conservancy construction, like other construction undertakings, should try to shorten the distance between capital construction and production, so as to save manpower, materials, and money, and serve production as much, as quickly, and as well as possible. To achieve this, the speed and quality of construction play an important role. Therefore, in the construction process, we should fully develop the masses' soaring enthusiasm, carry out high work efficiency movements, and strive to complete the work ahead of schedule. However, construction must first have plans and programs, and whether the plans and programs are in line with the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical often determines whether the construction can be more, faster, better, and more economical. From this point of view, a correct plan and program for water conservancy construction is an important link in shortening the distance between capital construction and production.

    For all water storage projects, the size of the capacity determines the size of the project. In general, the larger the capacity, the larger the project; the larger the project, the more manpower, materials, and financial resources are needed, and the longer it takes. The reason why people want a large capacity is to store more water. Generally speaking, the larger the capacity, the more water is stored; but it is not true that the larger the capacity of a reservoir, the more water it will store. Whether the water storage is large or not depends on whether the water source is large. If the water source is not large, even if the reservoir is very large, it cannot store much water. Therefore, in water conservancy construction, properly handling the relationship between capacity and water storage and minimizing the distance between the two is an important indicator to measure the quality of the project design. Therefore, we require larger small and medium-sized projects, especially large-scale projects, to try to make the capacity compatible with water storage. If this is done, it can save manpower, materials, and financial resources, and strive for early completion and early benefits. How can we make the reservoir's capacity compatible with water storage? We should calculate the runoff area and rainfall of the reservoir's upstream more accurately, and calculate the amount of water storage based on the water source. Then design the capacity based on the possible water storage. Doing so will be much more reliable than determining the capacity based solely on observations of the terrain and topography. The Yuxi Special District has done this, which has reduced the temporarily unnecessary workload without affecting the amount of water storage.

    After shortening the distance between reservoir capacity and water storage, it is also necessary to shorten the distance between water storage and benefit. Only in this way can we truly achieve the goal of shortening the distance between capital construction and production. Under normal circumstances, storing water can bring benefits. However, according to years of experience, some reservoirs have a lot of water, but they cannot all be used for irrigation, or they cannot be used for irrigation quickly; some reservoirs have sufficient water sources, which are suitable for water storage, but there is no farmland downstream that can be irrigated, or the irrigation problem has already been solved downstream. In order to save strength, reservoirs can be reduced or not built in these places. Some reservoirs are suitable for water storage, but it is necessary to build longer or more difficult irrigation canals; for such projects, the embankment construction and canal projects should be calculated and considered together. Experience in various places has proved that canal engineering is a project that should not be underestimated. If preparations are not made early, it will be useless even if water is stored. We should also consider various water conservancy projects from the perspective of minimizing the distance between water storage and benefit, and rank them accordingly: projects that have water to store and can benefit early should be started early and actively constructed; projects that benefit late and lack strength should be started slowly or constructed in phases; projects that cannot benefit should be resolutely reduced. In short, deciding which projects should be built on a large scale, which should be constructed in phases or slowly, and which should not be built is a relatively complicated issue that must be analyzed and resolved specifically according to the specific circumstances. However, when weighing the pros and cons and arranging priorities, special attention should be paid to the relationship between capacity, water storage, and benefit. As a result of doing so, the Yuxi Special District has achieved significant benefits. They have reduced some projects and also increased some projects. With the same manpower, the benefited area has increased by 70% compared to the original plan. This proves that shortening the distance between capacity, water storage, and benefit is a way to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results in water conservancy construction.

    正确处理水库容积、蓄水、受益关系
    本报评论员
    云南省玉溪专区在水利不断跃进的基础上，总结了多年的经验，提出了缩短容积、蓄水、受益三者之间的距离的做法，已经收到了显著的成效。这就说明，总结过去已有经验，使当前水利建设更有成效地进行，是非常必要的。
    农田水利建设和其他建设事业一样，应当尽量缩短基本建设和生产之间的距离，做到既省人、省物、省钱，又尽多、尽快、尽好地为生产服务。要做到这一点，施工的快慢好坏起着重要作用。因此，在施工过程中应当充分发扬群众的冲天干劲，开展高工效运动，力争提早完工。但是，施工必须先有计划、方案，计划、方案是否符合多、快、好、省的精神，往往又决定了施工能否做到多、快、好、省。从这个意义上讲，水利建设有一个正确的计划、方案，就是缩短基本建设和生产之间的距离的重要环节。
    对一切蓄水工程来说，容积的大小，决定着工程量的大小。在一般情况下，容积越大，工程量也越大；工程量越大，需要的人力、物力、财力也会越多，用的时间也较长。而人们之所以要容积大，都是希望蓄水多。一般地讲，容积越大，蓄水越多；但并不是随便一个水库的容积越大，蓄水就会越多的。蓄水是否多，还要看水源是否大。如果水源不大，即使水库很大，也不能蓄起很多水来。因此，在水利建设中，恰当地处理容积与蓄水的关系，尽量缩短两者的距离，是衡量工程设计好坏的一项重要标志。所以，我们要求较大的小型、中型工程，尤其是大型工程，尽量做到容积与蓄水相适应。如果这样做了，那就既可以节省人力、物力、财力，又可以争取早完工、早受益。怎样才能做到水库的容积与蓄水相适应呢？应当比较准确地计算水库上游的径流面积和降雨量，应当根据水源情况计算蓄水数量，然后根据可能的蓄水量设计容积。这样做，会比仅仅根据地势、地形的观察确定容积要可靠的多。玉溪专区这样做了，既减少了暂时不必要的工程量，又不影响蓄水数量。
    在缩短了水库容积与蓄水之间的距离之后，还必须缩短蓄水与受益之间的距离。这样做，才能真正达到缩短基本建设与生产之间的距离。在一般情况下，蓄起了水就可以受益。但是，根据多年的经验看，有些水库水量虽则很多，但不能全部用于灌溉，或不能很快用于灌溉；有些水库水源很足，宜于蓄水，但在下游没有田地可以灌溉，或者下游已经解决了灌溉问题。为了节省力量，在这些地方可以削减或不修水库。有些水库适于蓄水，但必须修筑较长或工程较艰巨的灌溉渠道；对这样的工程，就应当把筑堤工程和渠道工程一并计算，一并考虑。各地的经验都证明：渠道工程是一个不容轻视的工程，如不早作打算，即使蓄起水来，也使用不上。还应当根据尽量缩短蓄水与受益之间的距离的原则，反过来考虑各种水利工程，并据此进行排队：凡是有水蓄，又能早受益的，应当早动工、积极施工；凡是受益迟而力量不足的，应当缓动工或分期施工；凡是不能受益的工程就应当坚决削减。总之，决定哪些工程大修特修，哪些分期施工或缓修，哪些不修，是一个比较复杂的问题，必须根据具体情况，具体地分析解决。不过在权衡轻重、安排缓急之时，应当特别重视容积、蓄水与受益之间的关系。玉溪专区这样做的结果，已获得显著的好处，他们削减了一些工程，也增加了一些工程。用同样的人力，使受益的面积比原计划增加了70％。这就证明了缩短容积、蓄水、受益三者之间的距离，是水利建设中一个多、快、好、省的办法。
