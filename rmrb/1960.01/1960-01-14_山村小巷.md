    Mountain Village Alley
    Song Yansheng (woodcut), Li Cun (poem)
    The mountain village alley is quiet,
    Children's laughter and songs fill the air,
    The wind whistles through the utility pole,
    The fruit trees behind the wall are laden,
    Doves land in front of the door,
    Seeming like a pair of swallows from the commune.
    Beyond the green hills,
    Is a clear blue sky,
    Commune members dance gracefully,
    Swallow songs and oriole voices spread everywhere,
    Ten thousand miles of rivers and mountains,
    A beautiful human world.
    The wind blows into the alley,
    Leading me back to my hometown.
    The socialist dream comes true,
    A paradise is initially built:
    The mountain village is picturesque with the sound of motors,
    Cuckoos sing beside the hydro-power station...

    山村小巷
    宋彦圣木刻　李村诗山村小巷人静，儿童笑语歌喧，电线杆头风吹笛，墙后果树沉甸甸，鸽子落门前，仿佛公社双飞燕。青山外，碧蓝天，社员舞影翩翩，燕语莺声传遍，江山万里，锦绣人间。风吹入小巷，引我回故园。社会主义梦成真，乐园初建：山村如画马达响，水电站边啼杜鹃……山村小巷人静，儿童笑语歌喧，电线杆头风吹笛，墙后果树沉甸甸，鸽子落门前，仿佛公社双飞燕。青山外，碧蓝天，社员舞影翩翩，燕语莺声传遍，江山万里，锦绣人间。风吹入小巷，引我回故园。社会主义梦成真，乐园初建：山村如画马达响，水电站边啼杜鹃……
