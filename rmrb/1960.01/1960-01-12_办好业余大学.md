Running spare-time schools well while running full-time universities well has great significance for cultivating various professional talents and popularizing higher education.

With the rapid development of China's industrial and agricultural production, the cultural level of workers is rapidly improving. In the ten years since liberation, tens of thousands of workers have entered spare-time primary and secondary schools, and a group of workers have completed secondary technical school or high school courses and have begun to attend spare-time universities. In the future, workers with high school cultural levels will emerge in a steady stream, and many will continue their studies; more and more employed technicians and skilled workers will enter various specialized night universities or correspondence universities to study higher cultural knowledge. Developing spare-time university education is already an important task.

Tsinghua University has persisted in running night universities well for four years. In the process of consolidating and developing, they have continuously explored various effective methods and overcome the difficulties often encountered by spare-time schools, such as high student turnover and conflicts between learning and production. This spirit is very good. This night university also opens its doors to workers and peasants and absorbs more workers into the school in a planned manner year by year, which is also worthy of great promotion.

The establishment of spare-time universities is still a young undertaking in China's education. How to run them more, faster, better, and more economically urgently requires the accumulation and dissemination of experience. We look forward to more and better experiences being promoted.

    办好业余大学
    高等学校在办好全日制大学的同时，努力办好业余学校，对培养各种专业人材、普及高等教育有着重大的意义。
    随着我国工农业生产的高速发展，工人的文化水平正在很快提高。解放后十年来，成千上万的工人进了业余中、小学，并有一批工人学完了中等技术学校或高中课程，开始上业余大学。今后，具有高中文化水平的工人将源源涌现，不少人将要继续深造；还有越来越多的在职技术人员和技术工人，将进入各种专业性的夜大学或函授大学学习高等文化知识。发展业余大学教育，已是一项重要任务。
    清华大学四年来坚持办好了夜大学。他们在巩固发展中不断地摸索种种行之有效的办法，克服了业余学校经常遇到的学生流动性大、学习和生产间矛盾等困难，这种精神是很好的。这个夜大学并且为工农开门，逐年有计划地吸收更多的工人入学，也值得大大提倡。
    兴办业余大学在我国教育事业中还是年轻的一门。如何办得多快好省，迫切需要积累和传播经验。我们期待有更多更好的经验加以推广。
