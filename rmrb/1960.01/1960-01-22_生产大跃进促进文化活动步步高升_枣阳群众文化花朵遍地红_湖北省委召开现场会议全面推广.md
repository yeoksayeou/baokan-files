    The Great Leap Forward in Production Promotes the Steady Rise of Cultural Activities
    Zao Yang's Mass Culture Blossoms Red Everywhere
    Hubei Provincial Party Committee Convenes On-Site Meeting for Comprehensive Promotion
    Main experiences: Adhering to the correct direction of cultural activities serving politics and production; Party committees at all levels attach importance, arranging and inspecting cultural work while arranging and inspecting production; Planting red flags, establishing pacesetters, and taking measures to cultivate and improve key personnel; Implementing the mass line, adopting various forms that the masses love to see and hear; Carrying out mass literary and artistic criticism to continuously improve the quality of literature and art.
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Party organizations at all levels in Zao Yang County, Hubei Province, while strengthening production leadership, have taken various effective measures to carry out mass cultural activities, so that the entire county presents a vivid scene of "two high tides of production and culture, promoting each other step by step." Now, this county is not only a big red flag in production in Hubei Province, but also a big red flag in cultural work in the province. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that Zao Yang County's experience of twisting the leadership of the production upsurge and the cultural upsurge into one rope is very good, and has specially convened an on-site meeting to promote it to the entire province.
    Zao Yang County used to be a county with few laborers, a lot of land, few plains, a lot of hills, few paddy fields, and a lot of dry land. Agricultural production had long been in a very low state, and it was one of the "low-yield areas" in Hubei Province. Since 1958, the Party organizations at all levels in the county have led the entire Party and the entire people to actively transform the hills and turn dry land into paddy fields, centering on large-scale water conservancy projects, so that the face of production has been greatly changed. Last year, although it suffered a rare drought, the output of major agricultural crops such as grain, cotton, and oil, as well as sideline production, still had a greater increase than the previous year of the Great Leap Forward. With the increase in production, the income of commune members has been continuously improved, and their enthusiasm has become higher and higher. After the autumn harvest, the county, under the conditions of fully exerting the superiority of the communes, has set off an unprecedented full-scale production upsurge centered on water management, hill management, and soil management, and the face of nature is undergoing tremendous changes every moment. Encouraged by this situation, the masses' demand for culture is becoming more and more urgent. The masses express their wishes in self-composed poems: "It hurts to work silently, it's fun to sing while working, dancing in the fields, one jump can reach the sky." "Stepping into the happy nest of the commune, I can't help but want to sing. The more I sing, the greater the energy, and the greater the energy, the more songs." In response to this situation, the Party organizations at all levels in Zao Yang County closely combined with the political movements and production centers of various periods, and launched the masses in a planned and organized manner, setting off a widespread upsurge of cultural activities throughout the county.
    In the past year, due to adhering to the correct direction of serving politics, serving production, and serving the masses, adopting the method of fully mobilizing the masses and carrying out mass movements, and fully utilizing various forms that the masses love to see and hear, a climax of mass cultural activities has been formed throughout the county. Various types of cultural organizations have been established and grown like mushrooms after a rain. Not only has each commune established a cultural center and a literary and art troupe, and each production team has a club and a cultural station, but also hundreds of clubs, singing teams, and writing groups have been established on the water conservancy construction sites. All these cultural organizations are of an amateur nature. Now, whether in the commune, in the production team, or on the water conservancy construction site, various cultural activities are in full swing, and mass singing, poetry, and cartoon activities are very active. In Dengdian Production Team of Lutou Commune, where mass cultural activities were started earliest and best in the county, about 80% of the people have learned to sing, each small team has a "poetry and painting garden," and commune members often cooperate with production to create and perform various small opera programs. About half of the people in the team have participated in creative activities. Other production teams have also seen vivid scenes of walls full of paintings and railings full of poems.
    After mass cultural activities were launched, people used various art forms to deeply and vividly reflect and praise the tremendous changes that have occurred in Zao Yang County in the Great Leap Forward movement, and continuously promote the development of production and construction. When the Wudian Commune organized commune members to march into the barren mountains, the commune members sang while working: "Thousands of hoes and tens of thousands of picks, flying up and down to dig the mountains, digging the mountains into fish-scale pits, making contributions to greening the barren mountains." Later, it suddenly started to rain, and people sang: "Today we are rained on, tomorrow the trees will become forests, the flowers are fragrant and the fruits are sweet, everyone likes it." The singing became higher and higher, and the enthusiasm became greater and greater. Although it was raining, no one wanted to leave the construction site, and more than 15,000 fish-scale pits were completed in a short time. At the oath-taking meeting for the management of Yao Gang in Taiping Commune, each labor group wrote letters of determination in poetry and carried out competitions with each other. After the mountain management movement was launched, the masses used forms such as sending good news and poetry contests to encourage everyone's enthusiasm, so that work efficiency continued to increase.
    The widespread development of mass cultural activities in Zao Yang County is inseparable from the continuous strengthening of leadership by Party organizations at all levels. From the county Party committee to the Party branches of the production teams, there are special personnel in charge of cultural work. Party organizations at all levels arrange and inspect cultural work at the same time as arranging and inspecting production; when formulating production plans, they also include cultural work as an important project. In order to strengthen the specific leadership of cultural activities, Party organizations at all levels have consistently adhered to the working methods of planting red flags, establishing pacesetters, grasping the backward, and catching up with the advanced from beginning to end, and have continuously taken effective measures to cultivate and improve key personnel. Since last year, a total of 1,560 cultural cadres have been trained, expanding the new force. Dengdian Production Team of Lutou Commune has been very active in mass cultural activities since it established an amateur troupe in 1952, which has played a huge role in promoting production, and has produced model figures who are both capable in production and culture, such as Yang Li-lan. The county Party committee seized this advanced unit and advanced figure, and successively convened seven county-wide cultural on-site meetings to promote the experience of Dengdian Production Team and Yang Li-lan, making "learning from Dengdian and catching up with Dengdian" and "learning from Yang Li-lan and catching up with Yang Li-lan" an action slogan for cultural work in the county.
    In order to continuously improve the quality of cultural work, in addition to adhering to letting the masses freely organize, perform, and sing, and organizing professional cultural workers to regularly go deep into reality and persist in labor training to improve their ideological level and the ideological nature of their creations, Zao Yang County has also created the successful experience of carrying out mass literary and artistic criticism. That is: through mobilizing the masses to hold discussions and point out the advantages and disadvantages of the creation or performance, and then continuously improve and improve. For example, the Henan opera "A Red Flower," which praised the labor model Peng Xueying, was organized by the masses for 26 discussions from scriptwriting to performance, and was revised 12 times according to the opinions of the masses. The creators and performers also participated in production with Peng Xueying to deepen their understanding of the character. This made the play have a certain ideological and artistic quality from content to performance, and it was deeply welcomed by the broad masses. (Yin Ping)

    生产大跃进促进文化活动步步高升
    枣阳群众文化花朵遍地红
    湖北省委召开现场会议全面推广
    主要经验：坚持文化活动为政治和生产服务的正确方向；各级党委重视，在安排和检查生产的同时，也安排和检查文化工作；插红旗，树标兵，并采取措施，培养和提高骨干力量；贯彻群众路线，采取群众喜闻乐见的多种多样形式；开展群众性的文艺评论工作，不断提高文艺质量。
    本报讯　湖北省枣阳县各级党组织在加强生产领导的同时，采取各种有效措施开展群众性的文化活动，使全县到处呈现出“生产文化两高潮，互相推动步步高”的生动局面。现在，这个县不仅在生产上是湖北省的一面大红旗，在文化工作方面也是全省的大红旗。中共湖北省委认为枣阳县把领导生产高潮和文化高潮拧成一股绳的经验好得很，已专门召开现场会议向全省推广。
    枣阳县原来是个劳力少、土地多、平原少、岗地多、水田少、旱地多的县份，农业生产曾长期处于十分低落的状态，是湖北省的“低产区”之一。1958年以来，这个县的各级党组织领导全党全民以大兴水利为中心，积极改造岗地和把旱地改成水田，使生产面貌大大改观。去年，虽然遭到罕见的大旱，全县粮、棉、油等主要农作物的产量和副业生产仍较大跃进的前年又有较大的增产。随着生产的增加，社员收入不断改善，干劲越来越高。入秋以后，全县又在充分发挥公社优越性的条件下，掀起了空前规模的以治水、治岗、治土为中心的全面生产高潮，大自然的面貌每时每刻都在发生着巨大的变化。在这样的形势鼓舞下，群众对文化的要求越来越迫切，群众在自编的诗歌中，这样来表达他们的愿望：“闷着干活两腿酸，唱着干活两腿欢，田间地头跳个舞，两腿一跳能上天。”“踏进公社幸福窝，心中不由想唱歌，歌儿越唱劲越大，劲头越大歌越多。”针对这种情况，枣阳县各级党组织紧密地结合各个时期的政治运动和生产中心，有计划、有组织地放手发动群众，在全县范围内掀起了一个广泛的文化活动的高潮。
    一年来，由于坚持了为政治、为生产、为群众服务的正确方向，采取了充分发动群众，大搞群众运动的方法，并且充分地运用了多种多样的为群众所喜闻乐见的形式，群众性的文化活动在全县范围内形成高潮。各类文化组织像雨后春笋般地建立和壮大起来。不仅每个公社成立了文化馆、文工团，每个生产队有了俱乐部、文化站等组织，连水利工地上也建立起了几百个俱乐部和歌唱队以及创作小组。所有这些文化组织，都是业余性质的。现在，无论在公社里、生产队里、或是水利工地上，各种文化活动都搞得热火朝天，群众性的演唱、诗歌、漫画等活动十分活跃。在全县群众文化活动开展得最早和最好的鹿头公社邓店生产队，约有80％的人学会了唱歌，各小队都有“诗画园地”，社员们还经常配合生产自编、自演各种小型戏曲节目，先后参加过创作活动的人占全队人数的一半左右。其他生产队也出现了画满墙、诗满栏的生动场面。
    群众文化活动开展起来以后，人们用各种艺术形式，深刻而生动地反映和歌颂了枣阳县在大跃进运动中所出现的巨大变化，并不断地推动着生产建设向前发展。吴店公社在组织社员向荒山进军时，社员们就边劳动边唱道：千把镢头万把镐，上下飞舞把山刨，满山挖成鱼鳞坑，绿化荒山立功劳。”后来，忽然下起雨来，人们又歌唱道：“今天被雨淋，明天树成林，花香水果甜，人人都喜欢。”歌声越唱越高，干劲越来越大，虽然下着雨，谁也不愿离开工地，没多久就完成了一万五千多个鱼鳞坑。太平公社在治理姚岗的誓师大会上，各劳动小组都用诗歌写出决心书，相互开展竞赛。治岗运动开展后，群众又用送喜报、赛诗会等形式鼓舞大家的干劲，使工效不断提高。
    枣阳县的群众文化活动开展得这样广泛，是和各级党组织不断加强领导分不开的。从县委到各生产队党支部，都有专人分工管理文化工作。各级党组织在安排和检查生产的同时，也安排、检查了文化工作；制订生产规划时，也把文化工作列为重要项目。为了加强对文化活动的具体领导，各级党组织还自始至终地坚持了插红旗、树标兵、抓落后、赶先进的工作方法，并不断地采取有效措施培养提高骨干。去年以来，共培养了文化干部一千五百六十人，扩大了生力军。鹿头公社邓店生产队从1952年开始建立业余剧团起，群众文化活动就十分活跃，对推动生产起了巨大作用，并出现了在生产和文化上都是能手的模范人物杨立兰。县委抓住这个先进单位和先进人物，先后召开了七次全县性的文化现场会，推广邓店生产队和杨立兰的经验，使“学邓店、赶邓店”，“学杨立兰、赶杨立兰”，成为全县文化工作的一个行动口号。
    为了不断提高文化工作的质量，枣阳县除坚持放手发动群众自编、自演、自唱，组织专业文化工作者经常深入实际、坚持劳动锻炼，以提高他们的思想水平和创作的思想性外，还创造了开展群众性的文艺评论的成功经验。这就是：通过发动群众座谈、讨论，指出创作或演出的优点和缺点，然后不断地改进和提高。例如，歌颂劳动模范彭学英的曲剧“一朵红花”，从编剧到演出，经过二十六次组织群众座谈，根据群众的意见作了十二次修改，创作和演出人员还和彭学英一块儿参加生产，加深了对这个人物的了解。这就使得这个剧从内容到演出都具有一定的思想性和艺术性，深受广大群众欢迎。　（殷平）
