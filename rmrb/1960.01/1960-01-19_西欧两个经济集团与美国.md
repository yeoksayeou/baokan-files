The formation of two opposing economic blocs in Western Europe and the emergence of a tense situation in which the United States stands on equal footing with these two blocs is an important development in the current international situation.

The Formation of Two Economic Blocs

This economic war between imperialist countries did not start today. When the six countries within Western Europe, namely West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, signed the "European Economic Community" treaty in Rome in March 1957, and organized the "Common Market," the prelude to this struggle had already begun. After the treaty came into effect on January 1, 1959, the struggle became more intense.

The Common Market is a new type of international cartel organization in which the six countries within Western Europe attempted to maintain old positions and seize new ones under the general situation of the US-British imperialist struggle for world hegemony. It is also an international monopoly agreement between West German and French monopoly capital to compete for Western European hegemony and redistribute the world market. The main content of this organization is to eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers between member states within twelve to fifteen years, formulate a unified foreign trade policy and tariff rates, eliminate obstacles to the transfer of labor and capital between member states, and establish a unified European Investment Bank, etc., to serve the profits of the six-nation monopoly organizations. In this way, a "small European" market with a population of 166 million will be separated from the rest of the capitalist world. The overseas territories of the member states, mainly France's colonies in Africa, will also be included in the Common Market, becoming the "European-African Community."

Such an exclusive organization is obviously a heavy blow to Britain's economic interests and political status in Western Europe. In order to cope with this threat, before the Common Market was formally formed, Britain vigorously peddled its "Large Free Trade Area" plan, which included all seventeen member states of the "European Economic Cooperation Organization," in an attempt to replace the Common Market and bring Western European countries under the name of Great Britain. Negotiations for this plan could not continue by October 1958 due to France's firm opposition. Therefore, Britain turned to wooing Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, Austria, and Portugal to form the "Small Free Trade Area." After years of negotiations, an agreement on the establishment of the "European Free Trade Association," commonly known as the "Small Free Trade Area" treaty, was finally reached on November 20 last year. At this point, Western Europe was officially split into two opposing economic groups.

The Small Free Trade Area has its major defects. (1) It is only a market half the size of the Common Market. (2) Geographically, the seven countries are scattered outside Western Europe (hence the name "Outer Seven"), and Austria and Switzerland are especially severed by the Common Market and cannot become a whole. (3) Britain's trade with other member states is much smaller than with the six Common Market countries. (4) Since Britain is unwilling for other member states to share its imperial preference system with the Commonwealth countries, the Small Free Trade Area only stipulates the elimination of all import quotas and tariffs on industrial products within ten years (tariffs on agricultural and aquatic products are handled separately), so it is not an "integrated" group in terms of organization. (5) Britain and Nordic countries such as Norway and Denmark have great disputes over aquatic and agricultural products, and Britain made considerable concessions in this regard when the agreement was reached this time. Therefore, some commentators believe that Britain has suffered some "losses outweighing gains." However, if Britain did not do so, other small countries would conclude agreements with the Common Market, leaving Britain even more isolated. In addition, Britain's vigorous efforts to put together the Small Free Trade Area have a greater purpose, which is to use it as a means to exert pressure on West Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries that rely more on the Small Free Trade Area market, in order to undermine the Bonn-Paris axis, dismantle the Common Market, and establish a Large Free Trade Area. Therefore, immediately after the signing of the Small Free Trade Area treaty, Britain immediately instigated Swedish representatives of the seven countries to write to the six-country group, ostensibly to discuss issues of contact and cooperation, and to make a probe to reopen the "Large Free Trade Area" negotiations. But precisely because Britain regards the establishment of the seven-country group merely as a bargaining chip for negotiations with the six-country group, the role of this group is even more limited.

Why the United States Favors One Over the Other

When the confrontation between the two economic groups in Western Europe is very acute, it is particularly noteworthy what position the United States has taken. It is unwilling to let the confrontation between the six and seven countries endanger "Atlantic solidarity" and American exports to Europe, nor is it willing for them to reach a trade agreement to confront the United States. Instead, it wants them to obediently listen to American control. The method it adopts is to directly intervene. When intervening, it supports the six-nation Common Market and ignores the seven-nation Small Free Trade Area. At the same time, it uses the division of Western Europe to force both groups to relax import restrictions on American goods.

There are reasons why the United States does not support the British-led Small Free Trade Area but strongly supports the six-nation Common Market.

Originally, the United States had been planning to support a strong political, economic, and military group in Western Europe after the war. The purpose was not only to target the socialist camp countries, but also to use it to suppress Britain. The six-nation Common Market is a product of the Western European "integration" movement advocated by the United States. Therefore, Britain's plan to dismantle the Common Market runs counter to this basic intention of the United States.

American officials do not hesitate to repeatedly emphasize to Britain that they admit that the sentiment for the Small Free Trade Area is not as pleasant as the recognition of the Common Market, and this is the reason.

In addition, from the perspective of economic interests, it is also natural for the United States to value the Common Market. American monopoly organizations have always believed that a "small Europe" that has eliminated trade barriers will provide them with new investment opportunities far greater than the seven-nation free trade area. In the past, in order to break through Britain's imperial preference system, American monopoly organizations conducted a large amount of capital exports to Canada and Britain. Now, from the perspective of profitability, investments in these two countries have gradually reached the saturation point. Today, the six Common Market countries, with their large market, large population, low wages, and high profits, can follow Britain and Canada as a place to use America's surplus capital, large-scale production experience, and higher and newer technologies. These are far from what the Outer Seven can provide. Britain's "Foreign Affairs Report" revealed two years ago that representatives of 60 large American monopoly companies held a meeting in "a certain place" in Italy and made a decision to launch a large-scale offensive against the Common Market and seize the main positions as soon as possible in order to cross tariff barriers and strengthen competition from within. In the past year or so, the penetration of American capital into the Common Market, as the "Wall Street Journal" (December 3 last year) said, has "changed from a slow inflow to a scramble." According to recent estimates published by the US Department of Commerce, the total amount of new American capital that poured into the six countries in the first half of last year was 222.2 million US dollars, compared with only 42.2 million US dollars in the same period in 1958, an increase that is faster than in any region outside "small Europe". As of mid-1959, American private direct investment in the six countries had increased from 636 million US dollars in 1950 to 1.8 billion US dollars, an increase of nearly 200%.

Another important economic attempt by American monopoly organizations regarding the Common Market is to use the six countries as a new economic aggression base to extend to economically underdeveloped regions such as the Middle East and Africa. They plan to use the Common Market's "European-African Community" to replace France and Belgium's positions in North Africa and plunder North African raw material production areas, especially the Sahara region. According to the December 28 last year "US News and World Report," French officials believe that the Sahara will become the world's ninth-largest oil producer within two years, the fifth-largest producer within five years, and by 1965, its oil production will exceed Iran and Iraq and reach Saudi Arabia's current production level. There are now six American oil companies participating in exploration there. These great opportunities provided by the Common Market cannot be provided by the Seven.

However, the Common Market also has contradictions with the United States. With the formation of the tariff barriers of this economic bloc, the position of American exporters in the Common Market will become increasingly unfavorable. The American "Newsweek" on November 30 last year pointed out that when the six Common Market countries unify their tariffs on imports from non-member countries in the future, American goods will not be able to compete with Common Market countries in these countries. The magazine cited as an example that American companies and West German companies now sell electric motors to France, each paying 31% tariffs. By 1970 or even earlier, the tariffs that American companies have to pay will be reduced to 16%, but by that time, its West German competitor—a member of the Common Market—will be completely exempt from tariffs on selling goods to France. Similarly, American companies currently pay a 6% tariff on selling switching equipment to West Germany. But by 1970, American companies will have to pay a 17% tariff for this product, while its Common Market competitors can be completely exempt from tariffs. This narrative in "Newsweek" reflects the vigilance that American monopoly capital harbors toward the Common Market while supporting it.

Three Aspects, Three Minds

In the situation where the two economic blocs in Western Europe and the economic interests of the United States stand on equal footing, an extremely complex contradiction arises.

As mentioned earlier, Britain, which represents the Small Free Trade Area group, has always wanted to build a "bridge" between the six and seven countries, that is, to resume the "Large Free Trade Area" negotiations, in order to dismantle the Common Market, or at least "conclude a multilateral agreement" between the six and seven countries in order to maintain Britain's interests on the European continent. The Common Market group only approves the establishment of a liaison committee to resolve the technical issues of trade between the two sides, and opposes negotiations between the two groups. France, in particular, wants to further strengthen the trade barriers of the Common Market. The United States neither supports Britain's proposal to build a "bridge" nor opposes France's rigid attitude, which will intensify the struggle. Instead, it wants to force the Common Market and the Small Free Trade Area to relax import restrictions on dollar goods without implementing reciprocal measures, so as to control Western Europe's trade relations according to its own wishful thinking.

It was against this background of infighting and each having its own plans that US Under Secretary of State Dillon conducted "exploratory talks" in four Western European countries in December last year, and recently convened a Western thirteen-country economic conference in Paris to negotiate relevant issues. After three days of bickering at the meeting, the result was only a decision on some procedural issues that favored the United States, and none of the substantive issues of the tripartite standing on equal footing were resolved. The Seven expressed particular disappointment after the meeting. The British "Financial Times" even published an editorial on January 15 saying: "A meeting to discuss pressing economic issues has once again ended with the establishment of several committees. In these committees, at least one committee (the committee responsible for handling the relationship between the Six and Seven—Note) is tasked with completing an almost impossible task." Now no one can say what the outcome will be. It seems that the trend of the Western European economic barrier war will intensify.

    西欧两个经济集团与美国
    吴半农
    当前国际形势的一个重要发展，就是西欧两个对立经济集团的形成，以及美国同这两个集团鼎足而立的紧张局面的出现。
    两个经济集团的形成
    帝国主义国家之间的这场经济战，不自今日始。当1957年3月西欧内部六国，即西德、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡，在罗马签订“欧洲经济集团”条约，组织“共同市场”的时候，这场斗争的序幕已经揭开。1959年1月1日条约生效后，斗争更趋激烈。
    共同市场是西欧内部六国在当时美英帝国主义争夺世界霸权的总形势下企图保持旧阵地和夺取新阵地的新型国际卡特尔组织，也是西德和法国垄断资本同英国垄断资本争夺西欧霸权和重分世界市场的国际垄断协定。这个组织的主要内容是：在十二年至十五年的期间内取消各成员国间的关税及其他一切贸易壁垒、制定对外的统一贸易政策和关税率、消除各成员国间的劳动力和资金调动的障碍、建立统一的欧洲投资银行等等，以为六国垄断组织的利润服务。这样一来，一个拥有一亿六千六百万人口的“小欧洲”市场就将和其他资本主义世界割裂开来。各成员国的海外属地，主要是法国在非洲的殖民地，也将包括在共同市场之内，成为“欧非共同体”。
    这样一个排他性的组织，对英国在西欧的经济利益和政治地位，显然是一个沉重的打击。为了应付这个威胁，英国在共同市场还没有正式形成以前，就大力兜售它的包括“欧洲经济合作组织”全部十七个成员国在内的“大自由贸易区”计划，企图以此代替共同市场，把西欧各国网罗在大不列颠的名下。这个计划的谈判，由于法国的坚决反对，到1958年10月已无法继续。于是英国才转而拉拢瑞典、丹麦、挪威、瑞士、奥地利和葡萄牙等国筹组“小自由贸易区”。谈判经年，终于去年11月20日达成关于建立“欧洲自由贸易联盟”的协议，即通常所谓“小自由贸易区”条约。至此，西欧正式分裂为两个对立的经济集团。
    小自由贸易区有它很大的缺陷。（一）它只是一个仅及共同市场一半人口的市场。（二）在地理上，七个国家都分散在西欧的外部（故称外部七国），尤其是奥地利和瑞士还被共同市场所割断，不能成为一个整体。（三）英国对其他成员国的贸易远比对共同市场六国为小。（四）由于英国不愿其他成员国分享它和英联邦国家之间的帝国优惠制，小自由贸易区只规定在十年内消除一切进口限额和对工业品的关税（对农产品和水产品的关税另有处理办法），故在组织上还不是一个“整体化”集团。（五）英国和挪威、丹麦等北欧国家在水产品和农产品问题上有很大的争执，这次谈判达成协议，英国在这方面是作了相当大的让步的。因而论者认为英国有些“得不偿失”。然而英国不这样做，别的小国就将和共同市场订立协定，而使英国更陷于孤立的地位。此外，英国大力拼凑小自由贸易区，还有一个更大的目的，即以此为手段，企图对西德、荷兰等依赖小自由贸易区市场较多的国家施加压力，以达到破坏波恩—巴黎轴心、拆散共同市场而成立大自由贸易区的目的。因此，小自由贸易区条约签订后，英国立即怂恿瑞典代表七国致函六国集团，以洽商联系和合作问题为名，作重开“大自由贸易区”谈判的试探。但正因为英国把七国集团的建立仅仅看作对六国集团谈判的讨价还价的资本，这个集团的作用就更受到限制了。
  美国为什么厚此而薄彼
    当西欧这两个经济集团对垒十分尖锐的时候，特别值得注意的是美国所采取的立场。它既不愿六国和七国之间的对垒战危及“大西洋团结”和美国对欧出口，又不愿它们达成贸易协议，同美国相抗衡，而是想使它们乖乖地听美国的控制。它采取的办法就是直接插手干预。而在干预时又支持六国共同市场，冷落七国小自由贸易区，同时利用西欧的分裂，迫使这两个集团都放宽对美国货的入口限制。
    美国不赞成英国领导的小自由贸易区，但大力支持共同市场六国，是有原因的。
    原来战后美国一直计划在西欧大陆扶植一个强大的政治、经济和军事集团。其目的既是针对社会主义阵营国家，也是要想借以压制英国。而六国共同市场正是美国所主张的西欧“整体化”运动的产物。因此，英国拆散共同市场的计划就同美国的这一基本意图背道而驰。
    美国官方负责人士不惜向英国一再强调，他们承认小自由贸易区的情绪没有像承认共同市场那么愉快，原因就在这里。
    另外，从经济利益着眼，美国重视共同市场也是理所当然的。美国垄断组织一直认为，一个消除了贸易障碍的“小欧洲”将给它们提供远较七国自由贸易区为大的投资新机会。过去美国垄断组织为了突破英国的帝国优惠制，曾对加拿大和英国进行了大量的资本输出。现在这两个国家的投资，从赢利的角度上看，已逐渐达到饱和点。而今天市场广大、人口众多、工资低廉和利润优厚的共同市场六国，都正可以继英、加之后成为美国过剩资本、大规模生产经验和较高较新技术的用武之地。而这些远不是外部七国所能提供。英国“外事报道”于两年前已透露说，美国六十家大垄断企业的代表曾在意大利“某地”举行会议，作出了大举向共同市场进攻，及早夺取主要阵地，以便越过关税壁垒，从内部加强竞争的决定。过去一年多，美国资本渗入共同市场，诚如“华尔街日报”（去年12月3日）所说，已“由缓慢的流入变为争先恐后”。最近美国商务部发表的估计，去年上半年新涌入六国的美国资本总计是二亿二千二百万美元，1958年同期只有四千二百万美元，增加的速度比对“小欧洲”以外的任何地区都快得多。截至1959年年中，美国在六国的私人直接投资已由1950年的六亿三千六百万美元增加到十八亿美元，激增了将近200％。
    美国垄断组织对于共同市场的另一个重要经济企图，是想把六国作为新的经济侵略据点，向中东和非洲等经济不发达地区伸张。它们计划通过共同市场的“欧非共同体”，取代法国和比利时在北非的地位，掠取北非的原料产地，尤其是撒哈拉地区。据去年12月28日的“美国新闻与世界报道”透露，法国官员相信，撒哈拉将在两年内会成为世界第九位石油生产者，五年内成为第五位生产者，到1965年，那里的石油产量将超过伊朗和伊拉克而达到沙特阿拉伯目前的生产水平。现在那里已有六家美国石油公司参加开采。共同市场所提供的这些大好机会，都是七国所不能的。
    不过，共同市场也是同美国有矛盾的。随着这个经济集团关税壁垒的形成，美国出口商在共同市场内的地位势将日益不利。去年11月30日的美国“新闻周刊”已指出，共同市场六国未来统一它们对非成员国进口货的税率时，美国货在这些国家将竞争不过共同市场国家。这家杂志举例说，美国公司和西德公司现在把电动机卖给法国，各付31％的关税。到1970年或者更早一些，美国公司要付的关税虽然会降低到16％，但是到那时候，它的西德竞争者——共同市场的成员国——将完全免税向法国出售货物。同样，美国公司目前向西德出售开关设备要纳6％的关税。但是到1970年，美国公司将要为这项货物交纳17％的关税，而它的共同市场竞争者可以完全免税。“新闻周刊”的这段叙述，反映了美国垄断资本在扶植共同市场的同时，对它所怀的戒心。
      三个方面三条心
    在西欧两个经济集团和美国经济利益鼎足而立的情况下，于是就呈现了异常错综复杂的矛盾。
    如前所述，代表小自由贸易区集团的英国自始就想建立六国和七国之间的“桥梁”，即恢复“大自由贸易区”谈判，以拆散共同市场，或至少在六国和七国之间“缔结一个多边协定”，以保持英国在欧洲大陆的利益。共同市场集团则只赞成设立一个联络委员会去解决双方贸易上的技术问题，而反对进行两个集团之间的谈判。尤其是法国，还要进一步加强共同市场的贸易壁垒。美国则既不支持英国的建立“桥梁”的主张，也反对法国的僵硬态度会使斗争激化，而是蛮横地想在不实行互惠措施的条件下，强使共同市场和小自由贸易区都放宽对美元货的进口限制，以便按照自己的如意算盘控制西欧的贸易关系。
    正是在这种钩心斗角、各有自己打算的背景下，美国副国务卿狄龙于去年12月在西欧四国进行了“探索性的会谈”，最近又在巴黎召开了西方十三国经济会议，对有关问题进行了谈判。会议经过了三天的争吵后，结果只对一些程序性问题作出了美国占上风的决定，而对于三方面鼎足而立的实质性问题一个也没有解决。会后七国集团特别表示失望。英国“金融时报”1月15日甚至发表社论说：“一个讨论迫切的经济问题的会议，又一次以成立若干个委员会而告终。在这些委员会中，至少有一个委员会（负责处理六国和七国之间关系的那个委员会——注）是被委托去完成一项几乎不可能完成的工作。”现在谁也不能说将会产生什么样的结果。看来，西欧经济壁垒战的趋势将会愈演愈烈。
