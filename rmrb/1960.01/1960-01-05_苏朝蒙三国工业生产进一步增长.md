The Soviet Union's steel production reached approximately 60 million tons last year, with major industrial sectors such as coal and oil exceeding their annual plans. North Korea completed a large number of new factories and mines, leading to a more rational industrial distribution. Mongolia's total capital construction area in the past year doubled compared to the previous year.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 1st: Many important industrial sectors in the Soviet Union completed their 1959 production plans ahead of schedule.

According to materials released by the Central Statistical Bureau of the Soviet Union's Council of Ministers, the Soviet ferrous metallurgy industry successfully completed its 1959 production plans for pig iron, steel, and rolled steel on December 29th. In 1959, the Soviet Union produced approximately 43 million tons of pig iron, exceeding the plan by about 300,000 tons; approximately 60 million tons of steel, exceeding the plan by 900,000 tons; and approximately 47 million tons of rolled steel, exceeding the plan by 800,000 tons.

The 1959 coal mining task was also completed on December 29th. By the end of the year, approximately 4 million tons more coal will be mined than planned.

The Soviet Union's oil extraction plan and the annual plans for the production of important non-ferrous metals were completed ahead of schedule on December 27th.

The annual plans for many important products of the chemical industry were also completed ahead of schedule. For example, the annual production plan for chemical fertilizers was completed on December 23rd, and the production plans for man-made and synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, and plastics were completed on December 27th. The plan for synthetic fatty acids was completed at the end of November.

Soviet railway transportation workers completed the 1959 freight transport plan on December 20th. By the end of the year, more than 50 million tons of goods will be transported beyond the plan.

Inland river transport workers transported more than 6 million tons of goods beyond the plan. The inland river cargo turnover increased by 10% compared to 1958.

The Soviet Ministry of Maritime Fleet announced that Soviet sailors had completed the transportation plans for both domestic and international maritime routes stipulated for 1959 ahead of schedule, transporting more than 1 million tons of goods beyond the plan.

The Soviet logging and sawmilling industries also completed their annual plans ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: Our reporter reports: In 1959, the people of North Korea achieved a series of victories on the capital construction front, successively completing a large number of factories and enterprises, which were put into production.

Among the newly built factories and enterprises in 1959, the important ones include: a machine tool factory, a metrology factory, a rolling mill, two railway factories, a cement factory, a plywood factory, a power station, a pharmaceutical factory, etc. In addition, some smelting equipment such as blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces were also repaired. In the movement to develop local industries, a large number of medium and small factories were also built in a scattered pattern.

The obvious characteristics of these newly built large factories are: most of them are heavy industrial factories, and especially machinery manufacturing factories and related factories and enterprises. The completion of these new factories has played a very important role in the development of North Korea's heavy industry. At the same time, it has also rationally adjusted the layout of the industry. The Guseong Machine Tool Factory, newly built in August 1959 with the assistance of the Hungarian people, has completely modern and automated equipment. Its design capacity is to produce 1,000 new machine tools per year. The Pyongyang Metrology Factory, also built with the assistance of the Hungarian people, can fully supply North Korea with the required metrology equipment and other precision machinery.

The Wonsan and West Pyongyang Railway Factories were built with the assistance of the Polish people. These twin-brother-like factories have the same scale and equipment. They both have tall and spacious factory buildings with 100,000 square meters of construction area, as well as modern equipment for repairing various locomotives and vehicles. The completion of these two factories not only completely solved the problem of locomotive and vehicle repairs in North Korea, but also inspired workers to be creative and start manufacturing freight cars themselves. In 1959, the Wonsan Railway Factory built more than 800 freight cars. This is of great significance to the development of North Korea's railway transportation.

The Madong Cement Factory, with an annual output of 400,000 tons of cement, and the Giju Plywood Factory, with an annual output of 45,000 cubic meters of plywood, were built with the assistance of the Soviet people. The Giju Plywood Factory will process the abundant timber of Mount Paektu into plywood of various specifications, and also manufacture a large amount of furniture.

The rolling mill workshop of the Chongjin Steel Works was completed on December 27th. This automated workshop can roll 200,000 tons of steel per year. The Chongjin Steel Works is famous for producing special steel and high-quality steel. The completion of this new rolling mill workshop will greatly increase the production of special steel and high-quality steel.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: According to the Korean Central News Agency, North Korea has exceeded its 1959 annual output value plan for light industry by 0.2% on December 25th.

The "Chollima Workteam" movement and the "Machine Tools Produce Machine Tools" movement launched in North Korea have provided a strong impetus for the development of light industry.

The textile industry, which occupies the most important position in light industry in North Korea, has completed 101% of its annual production target. The total output value of the textile industry increased by 49% compared to 1958, while the total output value in 1958 was already eight times that of 1944 before liberation.

The output of daily necessities in North Korea increased by 37% compared to last year, while last year's output of daily necessities was 8.7 times the average annual output before liberation.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, January 2nd: The Mongolian "Unen" published on the 1st a communique issued by the Mongolian State Statistical Bureau on the implementation of the 1959 capital construction plan. The communique stated that the 1959 capital construction plan was completed by 101%. A total of 620 buildings were newly built and put into use in cities and villages, with a usable area of ​​163,200 square meters.

The communique pointed out that the total area of ​​capital construction in 1959 doubled compared to 1958. Ulaanbaatar and some regions completed their plans 15 to 60 days ahead of schedule. According to incomplete statistics, labor efficiency in construction increased by an average of 9.8% compared to 1958.

    苏联海运部公布，苏联海员已经提前完成了1959年规定的国内外海洋航线的运输计划，超计划运输了一百多万吨货物。
    苏联伐木业和锯木业也提前完成了年度计划。
    据新华社平壤电　本社记者报道：1959年朝鲜人民在基本建设战线上取得了一连串的胜利，陆续建成了大批工厂企业，并且投入了生产。
    1959年新建成的工厂企业中，重要的有：机床厂、度量衡厂、轧钢厂、两所铁道工厂、水泥厂、胶合板厂、发电站、制药厂等，另外，还修复了一些高炉、平炉等冶炼设备。在发展地方工业的运动中还建成了星罗棋布的大量中、小型工厂。
    新建成的这些大型工厂的明显的特点是：大部分是重工业工厂，而且是机械制造业和与此有关的工厂企业。这批新厂的建成，对发展朝鲜重工业中起了很重要的作用。同时，还合理地调整了工业的布局。1959年8月在匈牙利人民援助下新建成的龟城机床厂，设备是完全现代化、自动化的。它的设计能力年产一千台新式机床。也是在匈牙利人民援助下建成的平壤度量衡厂能够完全供给朝鲜所需的度量衡器材和其他精密机器。
    元山和西平壤两所铁道工厂是在波兰人民援助下建成的。这一对双生兄弟般的工厂的规模、设备完全相同，它们都有十万平方米建筑面积的高大宽敞的厂房，各种修理机车车辆的现代化设备。这两所工厂的建成，不仅完全解决了朝鲜的机车车辆的修理问题，而且工人们还发挥创造性，自己开始制造货车。1959年元山铁道工厂就造了八百多辆货车。这对发展朝鲜的铁道运输有重要的意义。
    年产四十万吨水泥的马洞水泥厂，和年产四万五千立方胶合板的吉州胶合板厂是在苏联人民援助下建成的。吉州胶合板厂将把白头山的丰富的木材加工为各种规格的胶合板，另外还制造大量的家具。
    城津炼钢厂的轧钢车间在12月27日建成，这个自动化的车间一年能轧制二十万吨钢材。城津炼钢厂是以生产特殊钢和优质钢闻名的，这个新轧钢车间的建成，将大大增加特殊钢材和优质钢材的生产。
    新华社平壤电　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，朝鲜北部已经在12月25日超额0．2％完成了轻工业1959年度的产值计划。
    朝鲜展开的“千里马作业班”运动和“机床生产机床”运动对轻工业的发展提供了强有力的动力。
    在朝鲜北部轻工业中占最重要地位的纺织工业已经完成全年生产指标的101％。纺织工业的总产值比1958年增长49％，而1958年的总产值已经为解放前1944年的八倍。
    朝鲜北部日用必需品的产量比去年增加了37％，而去年日用品的产量为解放前每年平均产量的八点七倍。
    新华社乌兰巴托2日电　蒙古“真理报”1日刊登了蒙古国家统计局发布的1959年基本建设计划执行情况的公报。公报说，1959年基本建设计划完成了101％。在城市和乡村新建投入使用的建筑物共六百二十座，使用面积达十六万三千二百平方米。
    公报指出，1959年基本建设的总面积比1958年增加了一倍。乌兰巴托市和某些地区分别提前十五到六十天完成了计划。据不完全统计，建筑中的劳动效率比1958年平均提高了9．8％。（附图片）
