Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 5th: Prince Sihanouk, Prime Minister of Cambodia, accompanied by Prince Penn Nouth, Speaker of the Royal High Council, Deputy Prime Minister Nhiek Tioulong, and several ministers, today visited the construction site of the Cambodian plywood factory. This factory is one of the four factories being built with Chinese assistance.

    After carefully inspecting various parts of the project, Sihanouk delivered a speech to those present. He emphasized the significance of Cambodia's policy of neutrality. He said that this policy has not only gained the support of many countries, but is also conducive to the cause of world peace.

    When talking about China's assistance, Sihanouk said that China has always supported Cambodia's policy of neutrality. China knows that Cambodia needs some industries to strengthen its economic independence, and therefore, it decided to help Cambodia build four factories. China knows that Cambodia lacks technical personnel, so it has helped Cambodia train some technical personnel. Prince Sihanouk, on behalf of the Cambodian government, the Cambodian people, and Cambodian workers, expressed gratitude for the help of the Chinese people.

    Sihanouk also talked about the significance of industrialization. He said that although Cambodia is a small country with few factories, as long as the Cambodian people work hard, drops of water can converge into the sea. He asked the Cambodian people to work hard to learn technology and work hard to build Cambodia.

    据新华社金边5日电　柬埔寨首相西哈努克亲王今天在皇廷最高会议议长宾努亲王、副首相?刁隆和几位大臣陪同下参观了柬埔寨夹板工厂工地。这个工厂是中国帮助建设的四个工厂之一。
    西哈努克仔细地参观了这个工程的各个部分后，向在场的人发表了讲话。他着重谈到柬埔寨奉行中立政策的意义。他说，这种政策不仅获得了许多国家的支持，而且有利于世界的和平事业。
    西哈努克在谈到中国的援助时说，中国始终支持柬埔寨的中立政策。中国知道柬埔寨需要一些工业来加强它的经济独立，因此，它决定帮助柬埔寨建设四个工厂。中国知道柬埔寨缺乏技术人员，因此它帮助柬埔寨训练了一些技术人员。西哈努克亲王代表柬埔寨政府、人民和柬埔寨工人表示感谢中国人民的帮助。
    西哈努克还谈到工业化的意义。他说，柬埔寨国家虽小，工厂很少，但是只要柬埔寨人民努力劳动，那么滴水可以汇成大海。他要求柬埔寨人民努力学习技术和努力工作以建设柬埔寨。
