Is raising pigs an unrespectable thing?

In the eyes of rural girl Du Xiuhua, raising pigs can accumulate fertilizer, increase production, and provide meat, which is the most glorious and noble career. In February 1959, as soon as she stepped into the gate of the Hedong Pig Farm of the Hanzhong City Commercial Bureau, she made up her mind to be a red and expert livestock breeder for life.

The Hedongdian Pig Farm originally had a full-time mating staff. In April, because he was transferred to the countryside to engage in other work, a batch of sows in the farm went into heat. The female breeders were very worried about this matter. Old habits influenced them, and they were unwilling to do the mating work. Du Xiuhua thought at the time: If the sows are not mated during estrus, these over one hundred and sixty sows in heat will produce much fewer piglets. Thinking of this, she said to the other female breeders: "Let's do it ourselves!" As she said this, she went to drive the boars to mate with the sows. At this time, several other young girls pointed to the infrastructure workers in the farm and said: "There are so many people around, let's wait until they leave." "What's so embarrassing about doing work!" Comrade Du Xiuhua firmly demanded that everyone start immediately. Comrade Huang Zhenglin, the Party branch secretary, also rushed to help them after hearing the news, and praised Du Xiuhua's revolutionary spirit on the spot. Under the leadership of Comrade Du Xiuhua, all the male and female breeders in the farm started mating, so that more than one hundred and sixty sows in heat were all mated within two days.

After Du Xiuhua mastered the pig mating technology, she found that the breeding boars raised in the farm were energetic and there was a phenomenon of idle waste. At a meeting, she suggested to the Party branch: Carry out mating business externally. The Party branch accepted her suggestion and gave full play to the role of the breeding boars.

None of the pigs raised by Comrade Du Xiuhua has ever died. Some people say that this is because the cleaning and hygiene work is done well; some say that the epidemic prevention work is done well; and some say that the feeding method is good. These statements are all correct.

Du Xiuhua is also an expert in preventing and controlling pig diseases. She can recognize the onset characteristics of diseases such as hog cholera, swine erysipelas, and asthma, and also masters the treatment methods. Among the two hundred pigs she had bred and raised, more than ten had been ill, but they did not spread because she treated them in time, and no deaths occurred.

In the process of raising pigs, Du Xiuhua strictly abides by the operating procedures, keeps the farm clean, and keeps the pigs living in a regular manner. In hot weather, the pens and sheds are disinfected once a day and swept twice. The pig manure is swept away at any time, and the floor is rinsed with water. The pigs are given a bath once a day, the sows are given two nipple washes, and the feeding trough is disinfected every time it is used. The pigs under her care, whether day or night, will urinate and defecate in a certain place.

    杜秀华要作一辈子饲养员
    养猪，是不体面的事情吗？
    在农村姑娘杜秀华看来，养猪能积肥，能增产，能吃肉，是最光彩的高尚事业。1959年2月，她一踏进汉中市商业局河东养猪场的大门，便下定决心，作一辈子又红又专的饲养员。
    河东店养猪场，原来有个专职配种员。4月间，因为被抽调下乡去搞其他工作，偏偏就在这个当儿，饲养场里的一批母猪发情了。女饲养员为这件事大伤脑筋，旧习惯影响着她们，不愿去做配种工作。杜秀华当时心里想：母猪发情期间，配不上种，这一轮发情的一百六十多头母猪不知要少繁殖多少仔猪。想到这里，她便向其他的女饲养员说：“我们自己干吧！”说着，她就去赶公猪给母猪配种。这时，其他几个年轻姑娘指着场里基建工人说：“周围这么多的人，等人走了以后再说。”“干工作，这有啥难看的哩！”杜秀华同志坚定不移地要求大家立即动手。党支部书记黄正林同志听到这个消息，也赶来帮助她们，当场表扬了杜秀华的革命干劲。在杜秀华同志的带动下，全场的男女饲养员都动手去配种，使一百六十多头发情母猪在两天内全部配了种。
    杜秀华掌握了猪的配种技术之后，又发现场里饲养的公种猪，精力旺盛，有闲置浪费的现象。在一次会上，她向党支部建议：对外开展配种业务。党支部接受了她的建议，充分发挥了公种猪的作用。
    杜秀华同志所养的猪，从未死过一头。有人说这是清洁卫生工作搞得好；有人说是防疫工作搞得好；也有人说是饲养方法好。这些说法都对。
    杜秀华还是防治猪疫的能手。她能认出猪瘟、猪丹毒、气喘病等病症的发病特征，也掌握了治疗方法。经她手繁殖和饲养过的二百多头猪中，曾有十多头发过病，都因为她及时治疗而未能蔓延，更没有发生死亡现象。
    在养猪过程中，杜秀华严格遵守操作规程，保持场内清洁，使猪生活很有规律。热天，每天要把圈、舍消毒一次，清扫二次。猪的粪便随时打扫，并用水冲刷地板，每天给猪洗一次澡，给母猪洗两次奶头，食槽每用一次消毒一次，她负责饲养的猪，不论是白天或晚上，大、小便都会到一定的地方。
