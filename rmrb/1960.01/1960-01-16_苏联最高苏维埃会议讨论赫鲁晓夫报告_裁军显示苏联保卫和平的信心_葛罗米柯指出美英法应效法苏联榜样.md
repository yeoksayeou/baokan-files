Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th: The Soviet Supreme Soviet continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 14th and the morning of the 15th to discuss the report by the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev.

At the afternoon session on the 14th, the first speaker was Ustinov, a member of the Presidium of the Soviet Supreme Soviet. He said that the Soviet Union's unilateral disarmament once again proves the peaceful essence of Soviet foreign policy, and it points out a good path towards easing international tensions for all countries. He pointed out that this measure is of particular importance at the present time.

Ustinov emphasized that the powerful Soviet army will remain a powerful force for defending peace even after the disarmament.

The Chairman of the Soviet Peace Defense Committee, writer Nikolai Tikhonov, pointed out in his speech that the Soviet Union is moving towards the path of complete and thorough disarmament. He suggested that all countries, especially the major Western powers, should follow the Soviet example.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation, D. Polyansky, said that the Soviet Union is now able to further reduce its armed forces because the Soviet people's brilliant achievements in the development of science and industry have created all the conditions for realizing this bold decision.

The famous Soviet aircraft designer Tupolev said in his speech that the Soviet government proposed to reduce the armed forces once again because the Soviet people do not want war. It is because the Soviet state is unprecedentedly strong and powerful, and because the socialist camp is unprecedentedly strong and united today. On behalf of Soviet scholars, he supported the disarmament proposal.

Soviet Defense Minister Malinovsky, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions Grishin, worker of the Leningrad Hardware Factory Borodulin, Chairman of the "Communist International" Collective Farm of Tambov Oblast Andreyeva, representative of Uzbekistan Rashidov, and representative of Ukraine Gayevoy also spoke at the meeting.

At the morning session on the 15th, representatives Spiridonov (Leningrad), Brovka (Belarus), Mzhavanadze (Georgia), President of the Kazakh Academy of Sciences Satpayev, and Commander of the Moscow Military District Moskalenko spoke successively, saying that this step is fully in line with the foreign policy of the Soviet government and the Communist Party. The reduction of armed forces once again proves that the Soviet state is eager to live in friendship with the people of all countries.

Next, representative Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that the people of all countries are yearning for peace as they yearn for the greatest happiness. He pointed out the great achievements of Soviet science in conquering the universe. He said that it will soon be possible to fly to the planet closest to the Earth, and then to fly to more distant celestial bodies in the solar system. Nesmeyanov concluded by saying that Soviet scientists have always actively participated in the struggle for peace. They unanimously support the government's proposal to reduce the armed forces again. Representative Kurchatov welcomed the Soviet government's peaceful policy on behalf of the atomic scientists. He said that Soviet scientists will use all their strength to help realize this constructive policy. Kurchatov pointed out that for many years, Soviet atomic scientists have consistently studied the manufacture of atomic weapons and strived to improve them, because they saw the threat facing the motherland and understood that weapons must be manufactured that can guarantee the peaceful labor of the people. The Soviet Union has now produced economical and advanced atomic weapons rockets, and the designers have also completed their tasks well. The Soviet Union's current defense force is very reliable. Kurchatov expressed regret over the US representatives' delay in reaching an agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests. He expressed doubts about President Eisenhower's recent statement that the United States may resume nuclear tests.

According to Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: According to TASS, Moscow, January 15th: Soviet Supreme Soviet representative and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko spoke at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting today. He pointed out that the Soviet people will welcome the government's new proposal to reduce the armed forces. He emphasized the great international significance of the meeting discussing the reduction of Soviet armed forces.

Gromyko said that this is not an isolated measure for the Soviet government, but an important link in the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy.

Gromyko said that the Soviet example shows that countries that have no aggressive intentions or plans can now fully promote the cessation of the arms race with their own practical actions.

Gromyko recalled the remarks of some Western figures who would rather dance with the atomic bomb than engage in rational negotiations. Gromyko emphasized that the issue of disarmament is such a serious issue at the moment.

Gromyko pointed out that modern weapons have unprecedented destructive power, which makes it necessary to carry out comprehensive and thorough disarmament.

When talking about the German issue, Gromyko once again pointed out that the Germans themselves should reach an agreement on the issue of unification.

Gromyko then said that some political figures in the West simultaneously show fear of both war and lasting peace. He said that the Soviet Union advocates dismantling the entire war machine. The difficulties in achieving universal disarmament cannot be a reason to avoid solving this urgent problem. Gromyko concluded by saying that the parliaments of the United States, Britain, and France should follow the Soviet example and respond to the Soviet government's decision to reduce the armed forces with practical actions.

    苏联最高苏维埃会议讨论赫鲁晓夫报告
    裁军显示苏联保卫和平的信心
    葛罗米柯指出美英法应效法苏联榜样
    据新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联最高苏维埃14日下午和15日上午继续举行会议，讨论苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的报告。
    在14日下午会议上首先发言的是苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员乌斯季诺夫。他说，苏联单方面裁军再一次证明了苏联的外交政策的和平实质，它为各国指出了一条通向缓和国际紧张局势的良好的途径。他指出，这一措施在目前提出，有着特别重要的意义。
    乌斯季诺夫着重指出，强大的苏联军队在裁军后仍然是保卫和平的强大力量。
    苏联保卫和平委员会主席、作家尼·吉洪诺夫在发言中指出，苏联正在走向全面、彻底裁军的道路。他建议所有的国家，首先是西方各大国，都来效仿苏联的榜样。
    俄罗斯联邦部长会议主席德·波利扬斯基说，苏联现在之所以能够进一步裁减武装部队，是由于苏联人民在发展科学和工业方面的辉煌成就为实现这个大胆的决定创造了一切条件。
    苏联著名的飞机设计师图波列夫发言说，苏联政府之所以提出再一次裁减武装部队，是由于苏联人民不要战争。是因为苏联国家空前强大和有力，是因为社会主义阵营今天空前强大和团结。他代表苏联学者，支持这项裁军建议。
    苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基、苏联工会中央理事会主席格里申、列宁格勒五金工厂工人鲍罗杜林、坦波夫州“共产国际”集体农庄主席安德烈耶娃、乌兹别克代表拉希多夫和乌克兰代表加叶沃伊等也在会上发了言。
    在15日上午会议上，斯皮里多诺夫代表（列宁格勒）、白俄罗斯代表布罗夫卡、姆日阿瓦纳泽代表（格鲁吉亚）、哈萨克科学院院长萨特帕耶夫和莫斯科军区司令莫斯卡连科代表先后发言说，这个步骤完全符合苏联政府和共产党的外交政策。裁减武装部队再一次证明，苏维埃国家渴望同各国人民友好相处。
    接着，苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫代表说，世界各国人民像渴望获得最大幸福一样地在渴望和平。他指出了苏联科学在征服宇宙方面的巨大成就。他说，很快就可以实现向离地球最近的行星的飞行，而后还要向更远一些的太阳系星体飞行。涅斯米扬诺夫最后说，苏联科学家一向积极参加争取和平的斗争。他们一致拥护政府关于再次裁减武装部队的建议。库尔查托夫代表以原子科学家们的名义欢迎苏联政府的和平政策。他说，苏联科学家将以全部力量帮助实现这个建设性的政策。库尔查托夫指出，许多年来，苏联原子科学家始终不懈地研究原子武器的制造，并努力使其完善，因为他们看到了祖国面临的威胁，并了解到必须制造能够保障人民和平劳动的武器。苏联目前制成了经济的和完善的原子武器火箭，设计师也很好地完成了自己的任务。苏联现在的防御力量是很可靠的。库尔查托夫对美国代表拖延达成停止核试验协议的做法表示遗憾。他对艾森豪威尔总统不久前发表的关于美国可能恢复核试验的声明表示疑虑。
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联最高苏维埃代表、苏联外交部长葛罗米柯今天在苏联最高苏维埃会议上发了言。他指出，苏联人民将欢迎政府关于裁减武装部队的新建议。他着重指出了会议讨论裁减苏联武装部队一事的重大国际意义。
    葛罗米柯说，这对苏联政府来说不是孤立的措施，它是苏联和平外交政策的一个重要环节。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联的范例表明，没有侵略意图和计划的国家现在已经完全可以以自己的实际行动来促进军备竞赛的停止了。
    葛罗米柯追述了某些西方人士的谈话，这些人宁愿同原子弹跳舞——而不肯进行理智的谈判。葛罗米柯为此强调指出，裁军问题在当前是多么严重的问题啊。
    葛罗米柯指出，现代武器具有空前未有的破坏力量，这就使得必须进行全面彻底的裁军。
    葛罗米柯在谈到德国问题时，再一次指出，德国人自己应该就统一的问题达成协议。
    葛罗米柯接着说，西方的一些政界人士同时表现出又害怕战争又害怕持久和平。他说，苏联主张拆毁全部战争机器。实现普遍裁军的困难不能成为逃避解决这个迫切问题的理由。葛罗米柯最后说，美、英、法、三国的议会应该仿效苏联的榜样，并以实际行动响应苏联政府关于裁减武装部队的决定。
