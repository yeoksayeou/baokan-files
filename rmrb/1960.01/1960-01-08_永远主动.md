    Always Take the Initiative
    Sima Jin
    To be proactive is to win.
    Is there any basis for this statement? Yes. For example, in ball games, the side that maintains the initiative will win; in chess, the victor is invariably the one who takes the initiative. Countless aspects of life prove this point: to be proactive is to win.
    Production is no exception. We have vivid evidence right before our eyes: thanks to Shanghai's mechanical and electrical industry workers' proactive approach to production, they have produced a large number of machines since the start of the year, including many large-scale precision products and new products. This breaks with the old pattern of new products mostly appearing in the second half of the year, and it also changes the old habit of some factories not producing anything on the first working day of the new year. Take one step proactively, and you can be proactive every step of the way. Now, the factories are freeing up their hands to focus on improving quality and reducing costs, which provides a reliable guarantee for a better leap forward.
    Gaining the initiative in production, while not "as easy as flipping one's hand," is not too difficult either. This is because the object of production is a thing, something inanimate. In ball games and chess, both sides are people, and they must fight for the initiative. Who ultimately gains the initiative depends on tactics, skills, courage, and wit—whoever is better. Production is different; machines, raw materials, etc., will not compete with people for the initiative. People have complete "power in their hands." How much subjective initiative is brought into play determines how much initiative can be grasped. This is self-evident.
    However, despite the logic, it still requires some effort to put into practice.
    How can we fully grasp the initiative in production? First, we must have great ambition. By great ambition, we mean the aspiration to continuously improve and leap forward in production, never being satisfied. With this ambition and drive, we can constantly improve our work, innovate our technology, and move forward in great strides, allowing production to rise to higher and higher levels according to our requirements. Without this ambition, being content with the status quo and sticking to old routines, we are in effect surrendering the initiative and placing ourselves in a passive position, making it difficult for production to improve continuously. Second, we must grasp the laws. Production requires tools and raw materials, this is a law; machinery and equipment must be maintained, this is a law; balance between production links is also a law, and so on. Laws are not the same as old routines; they cannot be violated, but they can be mastered. The better we grasp them and act in accordance with them, the more proactive we will be. The fact that the Shanghai mechanical and electrical industry factories prepared for a good start to the year-end last year, prepared raw materials, overhauled machinery and equipment, and summarized good methods for organizing balanced production to ensure continuous leaps forward in production, etc., is precisely the result of grasping the laws, and therefore, they gained the initiative.
    It is up to people to make things happen. As long as we firmly grasp the initiative, always grasp the initiative, our production will continue to surge, and we will see red every day, red every month, red every year, red all the way to the end.

    永远主动
    司马进
    主动就是胜利。
    这话有没有根据？有。比如打球，哪一方稳操主动，哪一方就会赢得胜利；下棋，厮杀的结果，胜利者必然是主动者。生活中许许多多的事情都能证明这一点：主动就是胜利。
    生产也不例外。眼前就有最生动的事实：上海机电工业职工由于在生产中取得了主动权，今年一开工就生产出大批的机器，其中包括许多大型精密产品和新产品，一反往年新产品大多在下半年问世的旧常规，改变了某些厂新年第一个工作日不出产品的老习惯。一步主动了，就能步步主动。现在，各个工厂正腾出手来抓提高质量、抓降低成本等工作，这就为更好地跃进提供了可靠的保证。
    在生产中掌握主动权，虽然不是“易如反掌”，却也并不太难。因为生产的对象是物，是死的东西。打球、下棋、双方都是人，都要争主动。究竟最后谁取得主动权，这要看战术、技术、勇敢、机智、谁能更胜一筹。生产则不然，机器、原料等等，不会向人争主动，人们完全“大权在握”。主观能动性发挥多少，主动权就能掌握多少。这是显而易见的。
    但是，道理尽管这样，做起来也需费一番努力。
    怎样才能充分掌握生产中的主动权？这首先要有大志。所谓大志，就是要有使生产水平不断提高、不断跃进、而且永远也不满足的雄心。有了这种雄心大志，干劲十足，就能经常改进工作，革新技术，大步前进，让生产按照我们的要求步步高升。没有这种雄心大志，安于现状，按老规距办事，实际上就是缴出了主动权而处于被动地位，生产也就难以不断提高。其次，要掌握规律。生产要有工具有原料，这是规律，机器设备要维修，是规律，生产环节之间要均衡，这也是规律，等等。规律不等于老规距，它不能违反，但可以掌握。愈是掌握得好，顺其道而行之，就愈会主动。上海机电工业各工厂在去年年底就做好今年开门红的准备工作，准备好原料，检修了机器设备，总结了组织均衡生产保证生产不断跃进的好办法，等等，这正是掌握了规律，因而就取得了主动。
    事在人为。只要我们紧紧掌握主动，永远掌握主动，我们的生产就会不断高涨，就会日日红，月月红，年年红，红到底。
