Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 17th: Prince Sihanouk, Prime Minister of Cambodia, published an article in the “Nationalist” weekly on the 16th, stating that Cambodia refuses to participate in a so-called “Southeast Asian Organization” suggested by Thailand and the Philippines, both members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and does not agree to form a group of neutral countries.

    In the article, Sihanouk said that Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman had inquired about Cambodia's views on this issue during his visit to Cambodia. In addition, the Federation of Malaya recently invited us to participate in a conference of heads of government and prime ministers of Southeast Asian countries to begin establishing a common organization.

    The article stated that the Royal Government believes that, although this organization has some significance, the Royal Government cannot participate in it without abandoning the basis of our neutrality, which is why we have always stayed outside of treaties, conventions, and organizations that divide the world into blocs.

    The article said, "Furthermore, when considering the advantages and disadvantages of participating in this organization, we should recognize that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages." The article said that the main disadvantage would be to create divisions within our country, and a large part of our people would distrust the People's Socialist Community and the Royal Government of Cambodia, falling into the trap set by major powers using Asian allies as bait. We have to admit that the initiators of this organization are two member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (Thailand and the Philippines), and the inviting country (the Federation of Malaya) is fiercely anti-communist.

    The article said that another major disadvantage is that we will certainly be antagonized by communist countries, and even other non-aligned countries. The risk of incurring serious consequences is too great, and we cannot take this risk.

    The article discussed the Cambodian government's position on the proposed high-level meeting of India, the United Arab Republic, Indonesia, and Yugoslavia. The article said that if this four-nation conference is to establish a third bloc or make decisions on the fate of small countries at this conference, Cambodia will have to express its dissent and opposition.

    The article said that Asian and African countries have all suffered from the imperialism and colonialism of white powers, and they have made it clear that they will never adopt a similar attitude. Asian and African countries work together to uphold the principle of equality for all countries—whether they are large or small, rich or poor.

### 西哈努克拒绝泰菲两国的建议  柬埔寨不参加“东南亚组织”

    西哈努克拒绝泰菲两国的建议
    柬埔寨不参加“东南亚组织”
    新华社金边17日电　柬埔寨首相西哈努克亲王16日在“民族主义者”周刊上发表文章说，柬埔寨拒绝参加泰国和菲律宾这两个东南亚条约组织成员国建议的一个所谓“东南亚组织”，并且不同意组成一个中立国家集团。
    西哈努克在文章中说，泰国外交部长乃他纳·科曼在访问柬埔寨时曾探听柬埔寨对这个问题的意见。此外，最近马来亚联合邦邀请我们参加东南亚各国政府行政首脑和总理会议以便着手建立一个共同组织。
    文章说，王国政府认为，虽然这个组织有一定的意义，但是王国政府不可能参加这个组织而不放弃我们的中立的基础，这就是我们始终留在使世界分裂成集团的条约、公约和组织之外。
    文章说，“此外，在考虑参加这个组织的利害得失的时候，我们应当承认弊多于利。”文章说，主要的害处将是造成我国内部的分裂，我国很大一部分人将对人民社会同盟和柬埔寨王国政府产生不信任，落入利用亚洲盟国作为钓饵的大国所设下的陷阱。我们不得不承认，这个组织的发起者是东南亚条约组织的两个成员国（泰国和菲律宾），而邀请国（马来亚联合邦）是激烈反共的。
    文章说，另外的重大不利之处是，我们将肯定受到共产主义国家，甚至其它不结盟国家的敌视。招致严重后果的风险太大了，我们不能冒这种风险。
    文章谈到拟议中的印度、阿联、印度尼西亚和南斯拉夫举行最高级会议的问题时，说明了柬埔寨政府对于这个问题的立场。文章说，如果这个四国会议要建立第三个集团或者在这个会议上就各小国的命运作出决定，柬埔寨将不得不表示异议和反对。
    文章说，亚非各国都吃过白种人强国的帝国主义和殖民主义的苦头，它们明确表示决不采取类似的态度。亚非各国协力维护一切国家——不论是大国还是弱小国家，不论是富有的还是贫困的国家——平等的原则。
