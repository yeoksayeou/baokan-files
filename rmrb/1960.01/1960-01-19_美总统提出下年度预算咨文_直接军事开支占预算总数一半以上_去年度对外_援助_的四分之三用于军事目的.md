Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 18th: U.S. President Eisenhower today submitted the U.S. budget message for the 1961 fiscal year to the U.S. Congress. According to Eisenhower's message, the budget expenditure for this fiscal year will reach the huge figure of more than 79.8 billion U.S. dollars, of which direct military expenditure will reach more than 45.5 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 57.1% of the total budget expenditure. The budget expenditure for the 1961 fiscal year (from July 1, 1960, to June 30, 1961) increased by more than 1.4 billion U.S. dollars compared with the budget expenditure of the 1960 fiscal year (more than 78.3 billion U.S. dollars). Military spending remains at its highest level in recent years. It stipulates that the new appropriation for the U.S. Department of Defense is 40.6 billion U.S. dollars, and the annual expenditure is 41 billion U.S. dollars, which is an increase compared with the expenditure of the 1960 fiscal year. In addition to other appropriations directly used for military purposes—foreign military "aid," atomic energy programs, and strategic material reserves—the total amount of direct military spending in the new budget reaches more than 45.5 billion U.S. dollars.

Eisenhower talked at length in his message about maintaining a strong military force. He emphasized that the central task of the U.S. military expenditure in the 1961 fiscal year is to continue to pay attention to the "modernization" of the U.S. armed forces. At the same time, the U.S. military manpower will "continue to maintain approximately the current level—with 2,489,000 active-duty men and women at the end of the year." He said that the focus of the U.S. military strategy is "shifting from conventional warfare to missile warfare." To this end, Eisenhower suggested increasing the cost of purchasing missiles by 581 million U.S. dollars in the 1961 fiscal year, reaching 3.825 billion U.S. dollars. In addition, it is recommended to use more than 3.9 billion U.S. dollars to research, develop, and test new weapons, primarily missile weapons. The funds for purchasing aircraft have decreased by 1.39 billion U.S. dollars from the figure approved in the previous fiscal year, but there are still more than 4.75 billion U.S. dollars.

Because the U.S. government was shocked by the great achievements of the Soviet Union in space, Eisenhower proposed that the appropriation for the space program of the National Interstellar and Space Navigation Administration of the United States in the 1961 fiscal year would be more than 540 million U.S. dollars, almost double that of the previous fiscal year. This fund will be used to study rockets with tremendous propulsion.

The U.S. President also requested that "the development and production of nuclear weapons be maintained at the high level of previous years" in the 1961 fiscal year, and to "continue to vigorously develop various military reactors." To this end, he requested an allocation of 2.7 billion U.S. dollars in this area. In this fiscal year, the expenditure on using atomic energy to develop civilian electricity is only 250 million U.S. dollars.

The message also requested an increase in U.S. foreign "aid" appropriations to help promote the U.S. policy of arms expansion and war preparation and economic aggression. The message requested that new contracts for foreign "aid" in the new fiscal year should be 4.175 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of nearly 950 million U.S. dollars over the previous fiscal year. Of the above total, nearly 3 billion U.S. dollars will be used for direct and indirect military assistance.

The message requested that the "special assistance" appropriation "indirectly related to the military bases maintained by the United States" be increased by 23 million U.S. dollars over the previous fiscal year, reaching 268 million U.S. dollars; and requested an appropriation of more than 200 million U.S. dollars "to establish new diplomatic and consular posts in Africa, Latin America, South Asia, and Eastern Europe" and "expand language training programs." The message also stated that the United States Information Agency intends to expand its programs in Africa and Latin America, including the establishment of a new "Voice of America" broadcasting station in Africa.

In order to cope with the huge budget expenditure of the U.S. government, Eisenhower further planned to exploit the people, demanding "prompt legal action to increase taxes on highway and aviation fuels and raise postal rates," and suggested maintaining the high tax rates on some other taxes for another year. According to the Associated Press, Eisenhower's budget will make every American, regardless of gender or age, bear an average burden of 437 U.S. dollars.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th: U.S. President Eisenhower submitted a report to Congress on the implementation of the U.S. government's foreign "aid" program in the 1959 fiscal year on the 14th.

Despite the serious financial and international payment situation of the United States, Eisenhower, in a letter to Congress when submitting this report, still asked Congress to strengthen the foreign "aid" program in order to further arm the various aggressive military blocs pieced together by the United States and intensify the use of "economic aid" as bait to achieve the expansionist goals of the United States.

The report shows that three-quarters of the U.S. foreign "aid" expenditure in the 1959 fiscal year was of a military nature. The report said that of the U.S. government's total foreign "aid" appropriation of 3.4 billion U.S. dollars in the fiscal year ending last June 30, direct military aid accounted for 1.5 billion U.S. dollars, indirect military aid in the name of "defense support" accounted for more than 800 million U.S. dollars, and so-called "special assistance" accounted for more than 280 million U.S. dollars. The sum of these three items is 2.589 billion U.S. dollars. The report emphasized that the Far East region occupies the most important position in these military "aids." This fully reflects the U.S. conspiracy to intensify the creation of tension in the Far East.

When talking about the aggressive goals pursued by this plan in the Far East, the report said that the United States believes that Taiwan is the "pivot of defense in North and South Asia" and stated that the United States will "improve" the troops of the Chiang Kai-shek Group, strengthen its air force, and establish "Nike" missile battalions. The report admitted that the United States has transported new military equipment, ships, and aircraft to the Syngman Rhee puppet regime to "strengthen" the firepower of the South Korean army, and also used munitions, important ships, oil, artillery, communication equipment, aircraft, and various tools to arm Ngo Dinh Diem's army. At the same time, the United States will also strengthen the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and believes that Laos and Cambodia are "protected nations" of the treaty. The report shows that the United States is trying to accelerate the rearmament of Japan and make Japan a military factory for the United States to carry out aggression in the Far East.

The report also emphasized the importance of providing military "aid" to Western European countries, citing the "serious" situation in Berlin.

    美总统提出下年度预算咨文
    直接军事开支占预算总数一半以上
    去年度对外“援助”的四分之三用于军事目的
    据新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔今天向美国国会提出了美国1961财政年度的预算咨文。根据艾森豪威尔的咨文，这一财政年度的预算开支将达到七百九十八亿多美元的庞大数字，其中直接军事开支达到四百五十五亿多美元，占预算总开支的57．1％。1961财政年度（从1960年7月1日到1961年6月30日）的预算支出，比1960财政年度预算开支（七百八十三亿多美元）增加了十四亿多美元。军事费用仍然维持在近年来的最高水平。其中规定，为美国国防部提供的新拨款为四百零六亿美元，全年开支数为四百一十亿美元，比1960财政年度的开支又有增加。加上其他直接用于军事目的的拨款——对外军事“援助”，原子能计划和战略物资的储备等项目，新预算中直接用于军事方面的开支总数达到四百五十五亿多美元。
    艾森豪威尔在咨文中大谈保持军事力量的强大。他强调，美国1961财政年度军事开支的中心任务是继续注意美国武装部队的“现代化”，同时，美国的军事人力仍将“继续保持大约目前的水平——在年底现役的男女兵员为二百四十八万九千名”。他说，美国军事战略的重点正“从常规战争改变到导弹战争”，为此，艾森豪威尔建议在1961财政年度中把采购导弹的费用增加五亿八千一百万美元，达到三十八亿二千五百万美元。另外，建议用三十九亿多美元来研究、发展和试验新式武器，首先是导弹武器。采购飞机的款项比上一财政年度批准的数字减少十三亿九千万美元，但是仍然有四十七亿五千多万美元。
    由于苏联在空间方面的伟大成就使美国政府感到十分震惊，艾森豪威尔提出1961财政年度美国全国星际和空间航行局空间计划的拨款将为五亿四千多万美元，比上一财政年度几乎增加一倍，这笔款项将用来研究具有巨大推进力量的火箭。
    美国总统还要求在1961财政年度把“核武器的发展和生产保持在前几年的高水平上”，“继续大力发展各种军用反应堆”。为此，他要求在这方面拨出二十七亿美元。而在这一财政年度里在利用原子能发展民用电力方面的开支则只有二亿五千万美元。
    咨文还要求增加美国的对外“援助”拨款来帮助推行美国的扩军备战和经济侵略政策。咨文要求新财政年度中在对外“援助”方面的新订合同数为四十一亿七千五百万美元，比上一财政年度增加将近九亿五千万美元。在上述总数中，有将近三十亿美元是用于直接和间接的军事援助。
    咨文要求把“同美国维持的军事基地间接有关的”“特别援助”拨款比上一财政年度增加二千三百万美元，而达到二亿六千八百万美元；并且要求为了“在非洲、拉丁美洲、南亚和东欧设立新的外交和领事职位”以及“扩大语文训练计划”而拨款二亿多美元。咨文还说，美国新闻署打算扩大它在非洲和拉丁美洲的计划，包括在非洲建立一座新的“美国之音”播音台。
    为了应付美国政府的庞大预算开支，艾森豪威尔进一步在人民身上打主意，要求“迅速采取法律行动来增加公路和航空燃料的税收并提高邮费”，并且建议把其他一些捐税的高税率再维持一年。据美联社指出，艾森豪威尔的这个预算将使全体美国人不分男女老幼每人平均负担四百三十七美元。
    据新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔14日向国会提出关于美国政府在1959财政年度的对外“援助”计划执行情况的报告。
    尽管美国在财政上和国际支付方面情况都很严重，艾森豪威尔在提出这一报告时给国会的一封信中仍然要求国会加强对外“援助”计划，以便进一步武装美国拼凑的各个侵略性军事集团，并且加紧以“经济援助”为钓饵来达到美国的扩张目的。
    报告表明，在1959财政年度的美国对外“援助”开支中，四分之三是属于军事性质的。报告说，在去年6月30日结束的这一财政年度中美国政府总数三十四亿美元的对外“援助”拨款中，直接军事援助占十五亿美元，以“防务支持”为名的间接军事援助占八亿多美元，所谓“特别援助”占二亿八千多万美元。这三项合计共二十五亿八千九百万美元。报告强调指出，在这些军事“援助”中，用于远东地区的占着最重要的地位。这充分反映了美国在远东加紧制造紧张局势的阴谋。
    报告在谈到这个计划在远东地区所追求的侵略目标时说，美国认为台湾是“南北亚洲防御的枢纽”，并且表示美国要“改善”蒋介石集团的部队，加强它的空军力量，设立“奈克”式导弹营。报告承认，美国已把新式的军事设备、船舰和飞机运给了李承晚卖国政权，以“加强”南朝鲜军队的火力，同时还用军火、重要舰只、石油、大炮、通讯设备、飞机和各种工具来武装吴庭艳的军队。美国同时还要加强东南亚条约组织，并且认为老挝和柬埔寨是条约“保卫的国家”。报告表明美国正在设法要加快日本的重新武装，使日本成为美国在远东进行侵略的兵工厂。
    报告借口柏林局势的“严重”，也强调给予西欧国家军事“援助”的重要性。
