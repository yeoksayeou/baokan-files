Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 10th. Professor Leybkin, Doctor of Technical Sciences of the Soviet Union, published an article in "Komsomolskaya Pravda" today, discussing some issues related to the Soviet Union's upcoming testing of cosmic rockets.

Leybkin pointed out that this test does not include the final stage that will eventually enter outer space. This is to avoid wasting the expensive, complex, and instrument-laden rocket head intended for space flight. The purpose of this test is to study the operation of the first few stages of the rocket's acceleration phase before reaching extremely high speeds, and to verify the accuracy of their operation and the reliability of these stages. When the rocket stages separate and fall, they move farther and farther away as speed increases. The speed of the penultimate stage is already close to that of an intercontinental rocket, so it falls even further.

To ensure that the penultimate stage lands on Earth, a suitable location must be found on the Earth's surface. Obviously, such a location is best on the surface of an ocean. Because ships are easy to avoid on the sea, and it is also easy for aircraft to avoid it, this can ensure that the penultimate stage of the rocket lands completely safely.

Leybkin said that in order to reach other planets, or to be able to launch heavy satellites into orbit, it is necessary to know what the trajectory of future cosmic rockets will be. It seems most appropriate to have the penultimate stage of the rocket land in the equatorial region of the Earth. Therefore, the landing site for this test was chosen in an area of the Pacific Ocean. Moreover, here it is entirely possible to avoid accidents involving ships from various countries.

The scientist continued, saying that the Soviet government has asked all countries to guarantee the safety conditions in the relevant equatorial region of the Pacific Ocean, and hopes to receive their support, because the measures taken by Soviet scientists are for a peaceful scientific mission. These measures can provide beneficial scientific results and enable science to take a big step forward in benefiting all mankind.

    雷布金教授谈向太平洋发射火箭的科学任务
    苏联试验新火箭旨在造福人类
    新华社莫斯科10日电　苏联技术科学博士雷布金教授今天在“共青团真理报”发表文章，谈到了苏联即将试验宇宙火箭的一些问题。
    雷布金指出，这次试验没有将来要进入宇宙空间的最后一级。这样做是为了不把用于宇宙飞行的昂贵、复杂、装有许多仪器的火箭头部白白浪费掉。这次试验是要研究在达到极高速度之前，头几级火箭加速段的工作，并检验它们运行的精确度和这几级工作的可靠性。火箭的各级脱离火箭堕落时，随着速度增加而愈来愈远。而倒数第二级的速度已经同洲际火箭差不多，因此它坠落得更远。
    为了使倒数第二级落在地球上，必须在地球表面上找到适合的地点。很显然，这样的地点最好是在某一海洋面上。因为海面上船只容易躲开，也容易使飞机避开，这样就可以保证火箭的倒数第二级完全安全地着陆。
    雷布金说，为了到达其他星球，或是为了能把重型卫星射入轨道，应该知道未来宇宙火箭运行的抛物线是怎样的，看来最合适的是使火箭倒数第二级降落到地球的赤道地区。因此这次试验的降落地点选择了太平洋的一个区域。而且，在这里完全可以避免各国船只发生意外。
    这位科学家接着说，苏联政府已请世界各国保证太平洋有关的赤道地区的安全条件，并希望予以支持，因为苏联科学家采取的措施是出于和平的科学任务，这些措施可以提供有益的科学结果，并使科学在造福全人类方面向前迈进一大步。
