The Guyuan Special District in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is a mountainous area in the loess plateau of Northwest China, inhabited by both Hui and Han people. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, thanks to the realization of the people's commune system, the 700,000 Hui and Han people, with their unwavering will and heroic spirit that overwhelms mountains and rivers, have continuously won brilliant victories in the struggle to change the face of this arid mountain area, and the area is rapidly changing.

Originally, the Guyuan Special District had almost no irrigated land and suffered from drought nine years out of ten. Water resources were scarce, and some places even had difficulty with drinking water for people and livestock. Soil erosion was severe, and natural disasters were frequent. After the Great Leap Forward and the establishment of people's communes, the entire special district has built 11 large and medium-sized reservoirs, with five more under construction or about to begin construction. More than 750 large and small canals have been built, along with more than 5,930 wells and water cellars. The area of irrigable land has been expanded to more than one million mu, with an average of 1.5 mu of irrigated land per agricultural worker. In the large-scale mountain and water management campaign, more than two million mu of forests have been planted, more than one thousand large and small ravines have been managed, and more than 700,000 mu of terraced fields have been built, resulting in new scenes of gardens filling the mountains, terraces stacked upon terraces, water not running down the mountains, and mud not leaving the gullies. The large-scale management of mountains and water has also enabled people to continuously overcome the severe droughts of more than 120 days each in 1958 and 1959, as well as the unprecedented floods and hailstorms in the autumn of last year, and achieved continued leaps forward in agricultural production. Last year, the total grain output of the entire special district increased by 12% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, oil crops increased by 15%, and sheep increased by 30%, laying a better foundation for continued leaps forward.

With the change in the appearance of the mountainous area and the victory of the Hui people in the struggle to abolish feudal religious privileges and feudal exploitation, the unity of the Hui and Han people here has been unprecedentedly strengthened. Especially since the realization of the people's commune, thanks to the strong support of the Party and the state, significant changes have taken place in the economy of the Hui people. Of the original 921 production brigades in the entire special district, more than half of the 292 relatively poor Hui teams and the Hui-Han joint teams with a considerable proportion of Hui people have caught up with the wealthier or average teams in their local areas, reducing the proportion of "poor teams" from 31.7% to 9%. At present, inspired by the brilliant victories already won, the 700,000 Hui and Han people of the entire special district are full of energy and high spirits. A large-scale winter production mass movement centered on water conservancy and soil and water conservation is developing vigorously. The labor force invested in water conservancy and soil and water conservation has reached more than 150,000 at its peak, accounting for about 50% of the total labor force in the entire special district. In two months, they have completed 1.15 million cubic meters of earth and stone work for water conservancy projects, newly built and repaired 704 canals, completed the control of soil erosion over an area of 1,300 square kilometers, leveled fields and built simple garden fields of more than 350,000 mu, and afforested more than 530,000 mu. The scale, quality, speed, and enthusiasm are unprecedented. In the struggle to change the arid face of the mountainous area, we have deeply realized that the vast masses of Hui and Han people have inexhaustible wisdom and strength. As long as we persist in boldly mobilizing and relying on the masses, we can overcome various difficulties in the construction of the mountainous area and rapidly change its appearance. In 1958, the local Party committee put forward a fighting program of working hard for three years to change the arid and poor mountainous area, and the call to seize all three waters, manage all three rivers, utilize all water sources, and store water like storing grain, with each person storing 300 cubic meters of water. Inspired by this slogan, a large-scale mass water conservancy construction movement was quickly launched throughout the special district. We built 11 reservoirs, with a water storage capacity of about 200 million cubic meters, realizing the requirement of 300 cubic meters of water storage per person one year ahead of schedule. This movement continues to develop to this day.

The process of building mountainous areas through large-scale mass movements over the past two years has also been a process of overcoming all difficulties. For example, during the spring plowing season last year, most areas suffered from severe droughts that had never been seen before. At that time, it was necessary to take temporary measures to fight the drought and sow seeds, ensuring that more than two million mu of summer crops were sown on time, and to ensure the normal construction of many large and medium-sized water conservancy projects. At this critical moment, the question facing the Guyuan region's Party organization and the 700,000 Hui and Han people was: should they overcome all difficulties, accelerate the speed of water conservancy construction, and ensure that crops were sown on time? Or should they succumb to difficulties, slow down the pace of water conservancy development, and allow severe drought to create a vast expanse of barren land? Under the correct leadership of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, we mobilized 72,000 people to vigorously build water conservancy projects on the one hand, and mobilized 200,000 people to actively participate in the struggle against drought and sowing on the other. As a result, we not only overcame the severe drought threat and completed the sowing task, but also accelerated the progress of water conservancy projects, so that some reservoirs that were originally planned to be built in three years were completed in a few months or more than a year. When hailstorms and floods came in the summer and autumn seasons, on the one hand, it was urgently necessary to concentrate labor to harvest summer crops, and on the other hand, in order to ensure the safety of reservoirs and prevent flood hazards, it was necessary to accelerate the progress of reservoir projects. In this situation, we fully mobilized the masses and launched a nationwide movement to rush to harvest summer crops and fight floods. After days and nights of intensive fighting, we not only ensured the safety of the reservoirs, but also finished harvesting summer crops earlier than in any other year. In order to solve the problem of insufficient labor in the construction of mountainous areas, in addition to advocating that everyone contribute ideas and suggestions, combining agricultural permanent basic construction with shock campaigns, combining self-reliance with communist cooperation, and using the seasonal differences in agriculture between regions to support each other, we also carried out a mass tool reform movement. After the people's commune system was implemented, collective welfare undertakings centered on canteens were established, liberating the broad masses of Hui and Han women, which enabled us to overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor and ensure the smooth progress of mountainous area construction.

In the struggle to build water conservancy projects and overcome drought through large-scale mass movements, in order to solve the difficulties of insufficient funds, materials, and technical forces, we adhered to the principles of relying on the masses, making use of local conditions and simple methods, using local materials, relying on our own efforts, and striving for external assistance, and carried out a mass "four-self" movement of self-surveying, self-raising funds, self-donating materials, and self-building. In terms of overcoming the shortage of materials, we established local cement plants, lime plants, tool manufacturing and repair plants, and brick and tile plants. Except for wood and steel, we basically achieved self-sufficiency in the materials needed for water conservancy projects. In terms of technical forces, on the one hand, we discovered a large number of talents among the masses, and on the other hand, we took the construction site as a school and adopted the method of combining cadres, the masses, and technicians to train more than 1,200 technicians on the reservoir construction sites and established a permanent water conservancy infrastructure team of 10,000 people. In the past two years, we have overcome various difficulties in this way and achieved one victory after another. These victories have further encouraged our confidence in building mountainous areas and made us more aware of the power of adhering to putting politics in command and carrying out large-scale mass movements.

However, the process of carrying out large-scale mass movements, fully mobilizing the masses, and overcoming all difficulties is an intense, extensive, and profound struggle between two roads and two lines, and also a process of the proletariat's world outlook overcoming the bourgeoisie's world outlook. In the past, some people always believed that the Guyuan area was sparsely populated, lacked labor, had barren mountains and ridges, insufficient water sources, and backward culture and technology, and they always expressed doubts about whether the arid face of the mountainous area could be quickly changed. These people did not understand that the more arid it is, the more urgent the desire of the Hui and Han people to change the face of drought is, and that we need to take two steps at a time in our actual work. Although some people verbally admitted that the arid face of the mountainous area could be changed, they placed their hopes entirely on the assistance of the Party and the state and the support of other places. Some people also opposed the large-scale development of water conservancy and soil and water conservation and other agricultural basic construction with the agricultural production increase of the year, believing that the area was sparsely populated and there was a shortage of labor, and that the large-scale development of water conservancy and soil and water conservation would affect the agricultural production of the year, so they advocated that agricultural basic construction should be carried out slowly. Their proposals run counter to the Party's general line for socialist construction. To boldly mobilize the masses and carry out large-scale mass movements, it is necessary to constantly carry out struggles on the political and ideological front against these erroneous ideas, so that everyone can establish the ambition to conquer nature, transform nature, and let the mountains and rivers obey orders. Since the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses have been able to show a spirit of great fearlessness, and the large-scale mass movements have been able to rise one after another, precisely because we have continuously carried out struggles on the political and ideological front among the broad masses of cadres and the masses inside and outside the Party, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Autonomous Region Party Committee and in accordance with the law of "ideological liberation - work leap forward - ideological re-liberation - work re-leap forward."

In order to make the mass movement develop continuously and one wave higher than another, we have also firmly grasped the principle of taking water management as the key, focusing on storage, comprehensive management, and developing the construction of mountainous areas in an all-round way according to different conditions and local conditions. In the semi-mountainous and semi-plain areas with severe drought, we mainly use floodwater and free-flowing water for the benefit of the people according to water systems and mountain systems, and adopt a combination of water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation, focusing on the construction of reservoirs, and comprehensively managing the major river systems such as the Qingshui River, the Hulu River, and the Jing River. Many reservoir projects on these river systems not only play a role in intercepting floodwater and irrigating farmland, but also can generate electricity and raise fish, achieving comprehensive utilization. In the loess hilly areas with extremely scarce water sources and extremely serious soil erosion, we take soil and water conservation as the key, and carried out comprehensive management and continuous management by adopting comprehensive measures such as building dams, building terraced fields, managing hair ditches, and planting trees. In a few shady and humid mountainous areas, we take water as the key, vigorously increase grain production, and at the same time comprehensively develop and utilize mountain resources and develop diversified operations. Facts have proved that this can not only fundamentally change the appearance of the mountainous area, but also promote the all-round development of current agricultural production, thereby organically combining the current interests of the broad masses with long-term interests.

    让千山万水听使唤
    中共固原地方委员会第一书记　罗文蔚
    宁夏回族自治区固原专区，是西北黄土高原沟壑区的一个回汉族人民杂居的山区。1958年大跃进以来，由于人民公社化的实现，七十万回汉族人民，在改变干旱山区面貌的斗争中，以坚毅不拔的意志、气吞山河的英雄气概，接连不断地夺取了辉煌的胜利，使这个干旱山区的面貌正在迅速改观。
    固原专区原来几乎没有水地，十年九旱，水原缺少，有些地方甚至连人畜饮水都有困难；而且水土流失严重，自然灾害频繁。经过大跃进和人民公社化，全专区已修成大、中型水库十一座，并有五座水库正在施工或即将施工。兴修大小渠道七百五十多条，打水井、水窖五千九百三十多个。使可灌的水地面积扩大到一百多万亩，平均每个农业人口有了一亩半水地。各地在大规模治山、治水运动中，还造林二百多万亩，治理大小沟壑一千多条，修梯田七十多万亩，使许多地方出现了园林满山、梯田层叠、水不下山、泥不出沟的新景象。大规模的治山治水的结果，还使人们连续战胜了1958年和1959年两年各一百二十多天的严重旱灾，和去年秋季历史上空前未有的涝灾、雹灾，获得了农业生产的继续跃进。去年全专区粮食总产量比大跃进的1958年增加12％，油料增加15％，羊只增加30％，为继续跃进奠定了更加良好的基础。
    随着山区面貌的改变，和回族人民废除封建宗教特权与封建剥削斗争的胜利，这里回汉人民的团结已空前加强。特别是实现了人民公社以来，由于党和国家大力扶助，回族人民在经济上已发生了显著变化。全专区原来九百二十一个生产大队中，比较贫穷的二百九十二个回民队和回族人民占相当比重的回汉联合队，已有一半以上分别赶上了当地较富裕的队或一般队，使“穷队”由以前占总队数的31．7％下降到9％。目前，全专区七十万回汉人民，在已获得的辉煌胜利的鼓舞下，更是干劲冲天，意气风发，一个以水利、水土保持为中心的大规模的冬季生产群众运动，正在汹涌澎湃的发展着。投入水利和水土保持运动的劳力，最高时已达到十五万人以上，约占全专区总劳力的50％左右，在两个月的时间内，完成水利工程土石方一百一十五万立方米，新修和整修渠道七百零四条，完成控制水土流失面积一千三百平方公里，平整田地、兴修简易园田三十五万多亩，造林五十三万多亩。规模之大，质量之高，速度之快，干劲之大是空前未有的。我们在改变山区干旱面貌的斗争中，深刻地体会到：广大回汉族人民群众中蕴藏着无穷无尽的智慧和力量，只要坚持放手发动群众和依靠群众，就能战胜山区建设中的各种困难，使山区面貌迅速改观。在1958年地委提出了苦战三年、改变干旱贫穷山区面貌的奋斗纲要，和三水齐抓，三河齐治，把一切水源都利用起来，蓄水如蓄粮，每人蓄水三百方的号召。在这个口号的鼓舞下，全专区迅速地掀起了大规模的兴修水利众运动。我们兴修了十一座水库，蓄水达到两亿方左右，提前一年实现了每人蓄水三百方的要求。这个运动直到现在，还在持续不断地向前发展着。
    两年来，大搞群众运动建设山区的过程，也是我们战胜一切困难的过程。如去年春耕时节，大部分地区遭受历年未有的严重旱灾，当时既要采取临时措施抗旱播种，确保二百多万亩夏田作物按时下种，又要保证许多大中型水利工程正常施工。在这个紧要关头，摆在固原地区党组织和七十万回汉人民面前的问题是：战胜一切困难，加快水利建设速度，保证作物按时下种呢？还是向困难屈服，放慢水利发展速度，使严重干旱造成赤地千里呢？我们在自治区党委的正确领导下，一方面动员了七万二千多人大兴水利，另一方面动员了二十万人积极投入抗旱播种斗争。结果不仅战胜了严重的干旱威胁，完成了播种任务；而且加速了水利工程的进展，使原计划三年才能修成的有些水库在几个月或一年多就修成了。当夏秋季节雹灾和洪水来临的时候，一方面急需集中劳动力抢收夏田，另一方面为了保障水库安全，防止洪水危害，又需要加快水库工程的进度。在这种情况下，我们充分发动了群众，开展了全民性的抢收夏田与战胜洪水的运动，经过连天连夜的突击奋战，不仅确保了水库安全，而且较任何一年提前收完了夏田作物。为了解决建设山区中的劳动力不足问题，我们除提倡人人献计、个个献策，把农业常年基本建设与突击运动结合起来，把自力更生与共产主义协作结合起来，利用地区之间农业季节性差别互相支援外，同时还开展了群众性工具改革运动，人民公社化以后，兴办了以食堂为中心的集体福利事业，使广大回汉族妇女得到解放，使我们战胜了劳动力不足的困难，使山区建设得以顺利进行。
    在大搞群众运动、兴修水利战胜干旱的斗争中，为了解决资金、材料、技术力量不足的困难，坚持执行了依靠群众、因陋就简，就地取材、自力更生，争取外援的方针，开展了群众性的自勘测、自筹资金、自献料、自修建的“四自”运动。在克服材料不足方面，我们建立了土法生产的水泥厂、石灰厂、工具制造修配厂、砖瓦厂，除木料、钢材外，基本上做到了水利工程所需要的材料自给自足。在技术力量方面，一面在群众中挖掘大批人材，一面以工地为学校，采取干部、群众、技术人员三结合的办法，在水库工地上培养了一千二百多名技术员，并建立了一万人的常年水利基建队伍。两年来，我们就这样克服了各种困难，取得了一个又一个的胜利。这些胜利，进一步鼓舞了我们建设山区的信心，使我们更加体会到坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动的威力。
    但是，大搞群众运动，充分放手发动群众，战胜一切困难的过程，是一个激烈的、广泛的、深刻的两条道路、两条路线的斗争过程，也是无产阶级世界观战胜资产阶级世界观的过程。过去有些人一直认为固原地区地广人稀、劳力缺乏，干山秃岭、水源不足，文化技术落后，对山区能否迅速改变干旱面貌始终表示怀疑。这些人由于不懂得愈是干旱，回汉人民改变干旱面貌的愿望就愈是迫切，而我们在实际工作中就更需要两步并作一步走。有些人虽然口头上承认山区干旱面貌能够改变，但他们把希望完全寄托在党和国家的扶助与外地的支援上。也有人把大搞水利和水土保持等农业基本建设与当年的农业增产对立起来，认为地广人稀，劳动力不足，大搞水利与水土保持会影响当年农业生产，因而主张农业基本建设要慢慢来。他们这些主张同党的社会主义建设总路线是背道而驰的。要放手发动群众，大搞群众运动，就必须经常不断地同这些错误思想展开斗争，使人人树立起征服自然、改造自然，让千山万水听使唤的雄心壮志。大跃进以来，广大群众所以能够表现出大无畏的精神，大规模的群众运动所以能够一浪高一浪，正是由于我们根据党中央和自治区党委的指示，按照“思想解放——工作跃进——思想再解放——工作再跃进”的规律，在党内外广大干部和群众中始终不断地开展了政治思想战线上的斗争的结果。
    为了使群众运动持久地并且一浪高过一浪地不断向前发展，我们还紧紧抓住了以治水为纲、以蓄为主，综合治理，和根据不同条件因地制宜地全面发展建设山区的方针。在干旱严重的半山半川区，主要是按水系，山系，充分利用洪水、自流水为人民造福，并且采取兴修水利与水土保持相结合的办法，以兴修水库为主，集中治理了清水河、葫芦河、泾河等主要河系。这些河系上的许多水库工程，不仅起到了拦蓄洪水灌溉农田的作用，而且还能发电、养鱼，做到了综合利用。在水源十分缺乏、水土流失极为严重的黄土丘陵山区，以水土保持为纲，采取打坝地、修梯田、治理毛沟、植树造林等综合措施，进行了集中治理和连续治理。在少数阴湿山区，以水为纲，大力提高粮食产量，同时综合开发利用山区资源，发展多种经营。事实证明，这样不仅能够从根本上改变山区面貌，而且又能够促进当前农业生产的全面发展，从而把广大群众当前利益与长远利益有机的结合起来。
