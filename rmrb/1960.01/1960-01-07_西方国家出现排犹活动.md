Xinhua News Agency, January 6th: Fascist anti-Semitic activities continue to occur in West Germany and some other Western countries.

	In West Germany, where the recent anti-Semitic activities first broke out, fascists continue to act rampantly. They have again painted Nazi swastikas and anti-Jewish slogans in more West German cities. Last night, a Catholic church in a village near Bonn, the capital of West Germany, was painted with swastikas and the slogan "Jews get out."

	In the United States, fascists openly set fire to a Jewish school in New York last night. It has been proven that hours before the arson, swastikas painted in red and black paint appeared on the walls of the school.

	In Devon, Bristol, York, Liverpool and other places in Britain, a large number of anti-Semitic slogans and swastikas have also appeared recently. The slogans read "Bury the Jews, support the Nazis in Britain. Hail Hitler."

	In other capitalist countries, such as Italy, Belgium, Australia, Canada, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, etc., fascist activities such as painting swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans have also appeared almost simultaneously.

    西方国家出现排犹活动
    据新华社6日讯  法西斯排犹活动继续在西德和其他一些西方国家中发生。
    在最近的反犹活动首先爆发的西德，法西斯分子继续猖狂活动。他们又在更多的西德城市中画纳粹的卐字标记和反犹太人的标语。昨天晚上西德首都波恩附近一个村庄的天主教堂被涂上了卐字和“犹太人滚回去”的标语。
    美国的法西斯分子昨天晚上在纽约公然放火烧一所犹太人的学校。有人证明，在放火前数小时，这座学校的墙上出现了用红色和黑色油漆涂成的卐字符号。
    在英国德文、布利斯托尔、约克、利物浦和其他一些地方最近也都出现大量反犹太人标语和卐字。这些标语写着“埋葬犹太人、支持英国的纳粹。希特勒万岁。”
    在其他一些资本主义国家，如意大利、比利时、澳大利亚、加拿大、奥地利、瑞士、瑞典、芬兰等国也几乎同时出现了涂写卐字记号和反犹太标语的法西斯活动。
