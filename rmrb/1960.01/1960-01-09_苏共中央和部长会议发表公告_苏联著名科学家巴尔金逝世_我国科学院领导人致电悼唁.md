Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 8th. The prominent Soviet scientist, Vice-President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Academician Bardin, passed away on January 7th in Moscow while on duty.

On January 7th, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union issued an announcement regarding Bardin's death.

During his lifetime, Bardin was a Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, a Hero of Socialist Labor, and had been awarded the Order of Lenin four times for his significant contributions to science.

Academician Bardin was born in 1883 into a peasant family. After graduating from a comprehensive technical school in his youth, he could not find work. He later worked as a worker in a rolling mill. After the October Revolution, he actively led the restoration and reconstruction of several major factories. From 1937, he held important positions in ferrous metallurgy, and from 1939, he served as the Director of the Institute of Metallurgy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He began serving as Vice-President of the Academy of Sciences in 1942.

During his lifetime, Bardin made outstanding contributions to the design of fully mechanized new giant metallurgical plants, the manufacture of the most advanced standard metallurgical equipment, especially in oxygen steelmaking, and in the research of metals needed for new cutting-edge scientific fields.

The achievements of this renowned metallurgist were recognized worldwide. He was an academician of several national academies of sciences. Moreover, he was not only an outstanding scientist but also an active social activist. The Soviet people repeatedly elected him as a Deputy to the Supreme Soviet.

As stated in the obituary issued by the Soviet Academy of Sciences and other organizations, the death of Academician Bardin is a great loss to Soviet science and industry.

This newspaper reports: On January 8th, Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, sent a telegram to Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and the Presidium, to express condolences on the death of Academician I.P. Bardin. The telegram reads as follows:

To Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and all comrades of the Presidium:

I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Academician Ivan Pavlovich Bardin. On behalf of all staff members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, I extend my deepest condolences. Academician Bardin's outstanding achievements in science have not only made remarkable contributions to Soviet science and industry but have also enriched the treasure trove of human science. His contributions are immortal. During his lifetime, Academician Bardin always cared for and supported the development of the scientific cause in New China. In 1955, he led the delegation of the Soviet Academy of Sciences to attend the inaugural meeting of the departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and visited many research institutions and universities in our country, making outstanding contributions to helping the development of our country's scientific work and strengthening the ties and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet Academies of Sciences.

Academician Bardin will always live in our hearts. We believe that the work he initiated will be carried forward by Soviet scientists. His life of struggle for the construction of socialism and communism is a shining example for scientific workers and will be forever remembered by us.

Please convey our condolences to the family of Academician Bardin.

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

Furthermore, Li Siguang, Zhang Jingfu, Tao Menghe, Zhu Kezhen, and Wu Youxun, Vice-Presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Pei Lisheng, Secretary-General, also sent telegrams to the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences on the same day, expressing condolences on the death of Academician Bardin.
