Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 22nd: News from Tokyo: The results of a public opinion poll published today by the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" illustrate that the Nobusuke Kishi government is increasingly unpopular, and more and more people are demanding that Nobusuke Kishi step down.

According to the bourgeois newspaper's public opinion poll, 44% of those surveyed support the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, compared to 17% in a similar poll conducted in 1957. Support for Nobusuke Kishi continuing in power has fallen from 42% in 1957 to 28% this time.

Among those surveyed, 50% said that the Nobusuke Kishi government's policy toward China was not good. The number of people who support restoring diplomatic relations with China accounts for 75%.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 22nd: News from Tokyo: Housewives from six major cities in Japan, including Tokyo and Sapporo, strongly protested against the policies currently pursued by the Nobusuke Kishi government at a discussion meeting held on the 21st.

These housewives participated in a forum convened by Tokyo Radio on the evening of the 21st. The forum was broadcast live by the radio station.

A housewife from Tokyo said at the forum that she was angered by Nobusuke Kishi's sneaking off to the United States to sign the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." She firmly stated that mothers will redouble their efforts to fight to prevent the Diet from ratifying the "Security Treaty."

A woman from Osaka accused the Nobusuke Kishi government of not explaining the substance of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." She said that when housewives in Osaka learned that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" would lead to war and conscription, they were greatly shocked and began to oppose the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

A woman from Sendai said, "The current tycoons in the government do not listen to the voices of the people." She expressed her determination to do her best to get more women to stand up against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." She said, "A single housewife has no power. However, as long as we are united, we can make the politicians hear our voices."

    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本“朝日新闻”今天公布的民意测验结果说明，岸信介政府日益不得人心，要求岸信介下台的人越来越多。
    根据这家资产阶级报纸的民意测验，赞成岸信介内阁辞职的人，占参加测验的人的44％，而1957年举行的一次同样的测验中，赞成的人是17％。支持岸信介继续执政的人，已从1957年的42％，下降到这一次的28％。
    参加测验的人当中，有50％的人说，岸信介政府对中国的政策不好。赞成同中国恢复外交关系的人数占75％。
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本东京、札幌等六大城市的家庭妇女在21日举行的一个讨论会上，强烈抗议岸信介政府目前所执行的政策。
    这些家庭妇女于21日晚间参加了东京电台召开的座谈会。这个座谈会的实况由电台加以广播。
    东京的一个家庭妇女在座谈会上说，她对岸信介偷偷溜到美国去签订新的日美“安全条约”的行为感到气愤。她坚决表示，母亲们将加倍努力进行斗争，来阻止国会批准“安全条约”。
    来自大阪的一位妇女指责岸信介政府没有说明新的日美“安全条约”的实质。她说，当大阪的家庭妇女知道新的日美“安全条约”将导致战争和征兵，她们都大为震惊，并开始反对新的日美“安全条约”。
    来自仙台的一位妇女说，“目前政府中的大亨不听取人民的呼声”。她表示决心尽最大的努力使更多的妇女起来反对新的日美“安全条约”。她说，“单独一个家庭妇女是没有力量的。但是，只要我们团结一致，就可以使政客们听见我们的呼声”。
