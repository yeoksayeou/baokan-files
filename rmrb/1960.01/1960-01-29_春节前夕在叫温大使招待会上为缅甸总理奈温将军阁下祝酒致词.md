Spring has arrived, and we are delighted to welcome our esteemed guests.
The ice and snow are melting, and the red plum blossoms are about to bloom.
The flower of peace is precious, and the tree of friendship must be planted.
Both host and guests are joyful, let us empty our cups together.

    阳春今已到，且喜佳宾来。
    冰雪正消融，红梅看盛开。
    和平花可贵，友好树须栽。
    主客皆欢乐，共尽掌中杯。
