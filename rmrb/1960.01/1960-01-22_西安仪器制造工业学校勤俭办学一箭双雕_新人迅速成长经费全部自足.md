    Xi'an Instrument Manufacturing Industrial School Practices Diligence and Thrift, Killing Two Birds with One Stone
    New Recruits Grow Rapidly and Finances are Entirely Self-Sufficient
    (Our Dispatch) The Xi'an Instrument Manufacturing Industrial School implements the Party's educational policy, training the first group of intermediate instrument manufacturing cadres for our country, while at the same time achieving complete financial self-sufficiency, not asking the state for a single penny for two years.
    The Xi'an Instrument Manufacturing Industrial School was established in 1956. Initially, education was divorced from productive labor. During student production internships, large materials were turned into small materials, and small materials into waste materials, or only small hardware tools were produced. In 1957, the total annual production value was only 3,700 yuan. In the 1958 educational revolution, the school implemented the integration of education and productive labor, with students mainly engaged in on-campus production internships. In less than a year, they created 1,040,000 yuan of wealth for the country, in addition to self-sufficiency for the entire year's expenses, with a surplus of 29,000 yuan. Since 1959, the school has continued to exert great effort, with the total production value increasing to more than 1,750,000 yuan, and a net income of more than 870,000 yuan. Although the school has added 860 new students this year, the teaching expenses are still completely self-sufficient, and there is still a surplus.
    In the process of production internship, under the guidance of teachers and auxiliary workers, students have successively trial-produced and mass-produced 33 kinds of products in more than a year, including spherometers, optical glass, opera glasses, "65" type precision bench lathes, "597" type electronic oscilloscopes, and 1,500x microscopes, etc. In production, teachers and students overcame various difficulties and used more than 20 repaired scrapped lathes to produce 210 new lathes. Among the three specialized internship factories established successively, 63% of the equipment was self-made, and the optical specialty factory self-made more than 90% of the equipment. Without cranes, they built their own earthen cranes to replace them. Without glass sawing machines, they used steel plates and emery instead. Some raw materials were scarce, so they solved the problems themselves. Labor has cultivated a spirit of diligence and thrift. Recently, the school mobilized the masses to make their own teaching aids. In less than three weeks, they created and imitated 798 teaching aids, saving a batch of expenses.
    With education combined with productive labor, students have gained more comprehensive knowledge than in the past. Students can not only apply textbook knowledge to solve difficulties in production internships, but also enrich theory through practice and improve teaching. Exam scores have improved significantly compared to the past. Compared with the mid-term exam results in the first half of 1959 and the second half of 1958, the percentage of students scoring 4 and 5 increased from 49.8% to 66.1%. In 1959, the school trained 161 graduates for the country. The quality generally met the requirements of the state. The students' operating skills in the main types of work in their major reached the level of a third-grade worker, and some even caught up with the level of a fourth-grade worker in certain technical operations.
    The school has also achieved certain achievements in scientific and technological research. The entire school has completed 21 research projects, and some projects have been reported at relevant national academic conferences.
    The reason why the Xi'an Instrument Manufacturing Industrial School has been able to achieve success in implementing the policy of integrating education and productive labor is mainly due to the strengthening of the Party committee's leadership and adherence to putting politics in command. Under the slogan of "drilling in and becoming an expert," eight of the nine Party committee members have taken on the task of teaching political and professional courses. The school focuses on teaching, organically integrating teaching and productive labor, and incorporating the products of the internship factories into the national plan. Based on the characteristics of the school, production is specifically arranged; theoretical courses are taught simultaneously during the production internship, which deepens the learning effect.

    西安仪器制造工业学校勤俭办学一箭双雕
    新人迅速成长经费全部自足
    本报讯　西安仪器制造工业学校贯彻党的教育方针，为我国培养了第一批中级仪器制造干部，同时经费全部做到自给自足，两年没有向国家要过一文钱。
    西安仪器制造工业学校在1956年建立。开始时，教育与生产劳动脱节，学生生产实习时，把大料变小料、小料变废料，或者仅仅生产一些小型的五金工具，1957年全年生产产值只有三千七百元。1958年教育大革命中，学校实行教育与生产劳动相结合，学生以在校内生产实习为主，不到一年就为国家创造财富一百零四万元，除了全年经费自给外，还节余二万九千元。1959年以来，这个学校继续鼓足干劲，生产总值增加到一百七十五万多元，纯收入八十七万多元。虽然学校今年新增加了八百六十名学生，但教学经费仍然全部自给，还能有结余。
    在生产实习过程中，学生们在教师和辅助工人的指导下，一年多以来，先后试制和大量生产的产品有三十三种，其中包括球径仪、光学玻璃、眼镜式观剧镜、“六五”型精密台式车床、“五九七”型电子示波器和一千五百倍的显微镜等。生产中师生们克服了种种困难，利用修理好的二十多部报废车床，生产出二百一十部新车床。先后建立的三个专业实习工厂，63％的设备是自制的，光学专业工厂自制设备达90％以上。没有吊车，就自造土吊车来代替。没有玻璃锯床，就用钢板、金钢砂来代替。有些原料稀少，也自己动手解决。劳动中培养了克勤克俭的风气，最近，学校里发动群众自制教具，不到三周，就创制和仿制教具七百九十八件，节约了一批开支。
    教育结合生产劳动，学生们获得的知识比过去全面了。学生们不但能够应用书本知识去解决生产实习中的困难，同时通过实践也丰富了理论，改进了教学，考试成绩比过去有显著的提高。以1959年上半年期考成绩和1958年下半年相比，得四分和五分的由49．8％上升到66．1％。1959年，这个学校为国家培养出一百六十一名毕业生，质量一般都符合了国家的要求，学生的操作技术在本专业的主要工种上，都达到了三级工人，有的在某些技术操作上赶上了四级工人。
    这个学校在科学技术研究方面也取得了一定的成绩。全校已完成研究项目二十一个，有的项目并在有关的全国性学术讨论会上作了报告。
    西安仪器制造工业学校在贯彻教育与生产劳动结合的方针中所以能够获得成绩，主要是由于加强了党委的领导，坚持政治挂帅，学校党委在“钻进去，变成内行”的口号下，九个党委委员中已有八人担任讲授政治课和专业课。学校以教学为主，使教学与生产劳动有机地结合起来，并把实习工厂的产品纳入国家计划。根据学校的特点，具体地安排生产；在生产实习期间同时讲授理论课程，加深了学习效果。
