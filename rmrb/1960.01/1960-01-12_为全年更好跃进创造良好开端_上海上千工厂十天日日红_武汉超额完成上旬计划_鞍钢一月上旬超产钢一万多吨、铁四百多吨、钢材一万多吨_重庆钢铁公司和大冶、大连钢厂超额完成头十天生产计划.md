Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 11th: Shanghai's factory and enterprise workers are seizing every day of production at the beginning of the year, achieving a "red start" and "daily red," and taking the initiative in continuing the leap forward in industrial production this year. According to incomplete statistics, more than a thousand factories in the city have completed their production plans for the first ten days of this month.

Entering 1960, the vast number of workers in Shanghai quickly pushed the socialist labor competition to a new high through various forms, breaking the "routine" of "slack at the beginning of the year and tight at the end" of previous years. In the first eight working days of the month, the Tianping Instrument Factory produced 915 advanced precision balances, such as double-pan semi-automatic balances and double-pan semi-micro balances, completing 45% of the value of production plan for January. After producing twelve diesel engines on the first day of work, the Chenfu Iron Factory workers advanced victoriously; by the 10th, the entire factory had exceeded its production plan every day, with an average daily output value 14.1% higher than in December last year, producing ninety-six diesel engines and a batch of accessories.

Leading cadres in many factories went deep into the workshops to check the production progress on a daily basis, ensuring the daily completion of the production plan. Since the beginning of the year, the leading cadres of the Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory have checked the workshop production plan every day, and promptly discovered and solved problems in the implementation of the plan. The factory completed 37% of the total monthly output value plan in the first ten days of the month, producing twenty-three sets of equipment such as hoists and crushers, and one hundred and fifty rice milling machines for supporting agricultural production. On the first day of work – January 2nd – the Jiangning Motor Factory produced two hundred and forty electric motors, setting a factory record for daily output. By the 9th, excluding Sunday, the factory had completed 50% of its January output plan in seven working days.

Since the New Year, workers in various factories have also put forward tens of thousands of technical innovation proposals, which have rapidly improved the level of production and ensured the completion of the production plan on a ten-day basis.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 11th: The vast number of workers on the industrial front in Wuhan City achieved a victory of "red start" and "full house red" in the first ten days of 1960. In these ten days, the city's industrial output value completed 120.71% of the ten-day plan, an increase of 20.73% compared with the average level of the ten-day period in the fourth quarter of last year. The production plans for the city's main products were all completed very well.

At the beginning of the New Year, Wuhan's factories organized "key problem tackling battles" and carried out technical performance competitions, setting off a wave of technical innovation and technical revolution in which everyone tackles key problems and every level tackles key problems. In the technical performance competition, the Wugang Coking Plant continuously set new records of producing 6,028 tons and 6,231 tons of coke per day. On the first day of work, Yuhua Textile Mill broke through many keys, increasing the equivalent unit output of cotton yarn from 35 kg to 35.5 kg. The Hubei Tractor Factory broke through three key problems on the first day, completing forty-four 8-horsepower diesel engines, 220% of the daily plan. Qingshan Thermal Power Plant broke through the coal consumption barrier, and the coal consumption from the 1st to the 5th was reduced from the planned 353 grams per degree to 324 grams per degree. More than 1,640 people in the Wuhan Automobile Manufacturing Plant participated in the key problem tackling and technical performance competition, performing 248 projects in one day and breaking through 29 keys.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 11th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company achieved complete success in the first ten days of the New Year. The production of steel, pig iron, and steel products all exceeded the plan and greatly exceeded the average daily production level in the fourth quarter of last year. In the past ten days, they produced 17,000 tons of steel, more than 480 tons of pig iron, and more than 11,000 tons of steel products than the ten-day plan.

Starting from New Year's Day, Anshan Iron and Steel workers have used the experience they created last year to carry out large-scale joint technical performance competitions, vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution, overcome many production keys, and continuously promote the improvement of production levels. Starting today, Anshan Iron and Steel workers are holding the second joint technical performance competition week to seize a greater leap forward in the mid-ten-day production.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 11th: Chongqing Iron and Steel Company exceeded its planned output of steel, steel products, and other main products in the first ten days of January. The daily steel production level increased by 18.4% compared with December last year, and steel products increased by 39%. Product quality has increased significantly.

In the "red start" production at the beginning of the New Year, leading cadres of various units of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company generally went deep into open-hearth furnaces, converters, and rolling mills to talk about the situation and tasks, personally participate in technical performance competitions, and fought day and night with the workers, which boosted the enthusiasm of the workers and solved many key problems, which made the output and quality significantly improved. In the first ten days of this year, the Daping Furnace Plant produced more than 1,350 tons of steel than planned, and the daily production level increased by more than 34% compared with December last year, and the quality exceeded the specified indicators. The Zhongshan Hall Converter Plant not only overfulfilled the production plan, but also increased the quality by 3.9% compared with December last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 11th: The workers of Daye Steel Plant comprehensively overfulfilled the steel and steel production plans for the first ten days of January. Compared with the average daily production level in the high-yield fourth quarter of last year, steel increased by 11.4% and steel products increased by 30.6%; product quality was significantly improved and the variety also increased.

At the beginning of the New Year, Daye Steel Plant fully used the experience of organizing balanced production and continuous leap forward last year, adopted the experience of grasping early, grasping well, grasping details, and organizing key problem tackling battles, and launched joint technical performance competitions around the key to production in the entire plant, ensuring the completion of the plan on a shift-by-shift and daily basis.

The workers vigorously engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution, and realized 103 major technical innovations, overcame 225 key problems of all sizes, and created 212 new production records within seven days. Leading cadres of the First Steelmaking Department went deep into the No. 3 open-hearth furnace to help workers summarize the five-step desulfurization method they created, and after organizing supporting promotion, the desulfurization efficiency increased from about 60% in the past to 80% to 90%.

Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, January 11th: Dalian Steel Plant comprehensively overfulfilled the production plan for the first ten days of January, achieving "daily red" and "full house red." In the first ten days of the month, steel completed 109.7% of the plan, and steel products completed 118.4% of the plan. The average daily output increased by 19.7% and 12.3% respectively compared with December last year; the utilization coefficient of cold charging of electric furnaces averaged 42.93 tons, an increase of 4.73 tons compared with December last year; the quality and variety of steel and steel products also exceeded the planned indicators. Dalian Steel Plant workers put forward 51 major innovation proposals in the first ten days of January and created 79 new production records. The First Steelmaking Workshop promoted more than ten advanced technologies such as rapid steelmaking, thin-slag oxygen blowing, and rational charging, which were implemented last year, so that the electric furnace smelting time in the first ten days was refreshed four times compared to the highest record created last year, and the smelting time was shortened compared with December last year, and a total of 424 tons of steel were produced in ten days. After the Second Rolling Mill organized the promotion of advanced experience, it improved the efficiency of the rolling mill and could roll 579 kilograms more steel per hour. (Attached pictures)
