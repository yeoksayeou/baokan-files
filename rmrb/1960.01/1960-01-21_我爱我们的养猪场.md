I Love Our Pig Farm
Lin Shuhao, A Soldier of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army

Every time I come to the pig farm of our unit, I always linger here for a moment, looking at the rows of neat and clean pigsties, gazing at the black and white hogs that prick up their ears and squint at me. These fat and hardy Ukrainian Large White pigs; the "Berkshire" big spotted pigs with their short, arched necks and broad backs; and the tall and long hybrid pigs, looking like little tigers from the front and "short-nosed elephants" from the side, are truly adorable in their air.

I love to stroll around the pig farm, not because I have a penchant for appreciating pigs, but because I love this pig farm because extraordinary things have happened here.

At the beginning of last year, this place was still a wasteland. Next to the walls of the barracks were a few dilapidated pig pens built of adobe. In January, there were more than 100 pigs here, but by February, a count revealed that only 90 remained. Where had those pigs gone? They had all died of illness! It was at this time that our beloved Political Commissar, took off his woolen uniform with the rank of Senior Colonel, and put on the old coarse cloth uniform he had kept from the war years, and came here to work as a pig farmer. Every time I passed by, I saw him either rolling up his sleeves to feed the pigs or holding a broom to sweep the pigsty. Once, I saw the Political Commissar feeding more than a dozen piglets. He bent over and added food one spoonful at a time. One of the piglets was very naughty, running around and not eating properly. Political Commissar Liu, like a teacher teaching a child, coaxed it to the feeding trough and let it eat well. I also heard the soldiers who raised pigs with the Political Commissar say that every night, the Political Commissar would tell them battle stories, talk about the significance of raising pigs for the unit, and explain how to raise pigs. In this way, the soldiers who were not content with raising pigs became more enthusiastic about it. They said, "We must learn from the Political Commissar!" And so, none of these 90-plus pigs died anymore.

Once, I went on a business trip for a week and came back. I ran to the pig farm and saw that it had changed again. In front of the old pig pens, there were piles of bricks, lime, and sand. The Political Commissar and the soldiers were building pig pens. Later, I learned that the Political Commissar had made a suggestion to the division's Party committee: In order to achieve self-sufficiency in meat for the unit, it was necessary to vigorously raise pigs; in order to achieve self-breeding and self-raising, it was necessary to establish a pig farm mainly for producing piglets. The division's Party committee agreed to this suggestion, and the pig farm quickly began construction. Officers and soldiers used Sundays and spare time from training and work to dig up old bricks and cut down trees, using their hard work to build thirteen rows of neat pigsties here.

Several months have passed. The pig farm has already raised 324 fine-breed sows, 25 fine-breed boars, dozens of large fat pigs, and dozens of hybrid piglets. When I see this prosperous scene, how can I not think of the scene of the Political Commissar raising pigs at that time, how can I not love our pig farm! (Attached picture)

### 我爱我们的养猪场

    我爱我们的养猪场
    解放军某部　林树浩
    每当我来到我们部队的养猪场时，总要在这里流连片刻，看看那一排一排整齐清洁的猪舍，望望那群对我竖着耳朵、斜着眼珠子瞪我的黑猡猡，白猡猡。这些肥大耐寒的乌克兰大白猪；颈短而拱弧、臂背宽阔的“巴克夏”大花猪；身板又高又长的杂交猪，正看像小老虎，侧看像“短鼻象”，瞧它们那副神气啊，真逗人喜爱。
    我爱在猪场蹓跶，并不是我有欣赏猪的癖好，我喜欢这个猪场，是因为这里发生过不平凡的事。
    去年年初，这里还是一片荒地，在挨着营房的围墙边，有几间用土坯砌成的破烂猪圈。1月这里养了一百多头猪，到2月数一数，只剩下九十多头了。那些猪到哪里去了呢？都病死了！就在这个时候，我们敬爱的政委同志，脱下他那缀着上校军衔的呢子衣服，穿上了战争年代保存下来的粗布旧军装，来到这里当饲养员。每当我走过这里的时候，看见他不是挽起袖子在给猪添食，就是拿着一把扫帚在扫猪圈。有一次，我看见政委在给十几头小猪喂食。他弯着腰一勺一勺地添。有个小猪可调皮啦，东跑西转，不好好吃食，刘政委就像老师教小孩子那样，把它哄到食槽边，让它好好地吃。我还听跟政委一起养猪的战士们说过，每天晚上，政委总要跟他们在一起讲战斗故事，讲部队养猪的意义，讲养猪的方法。就这样，原来不够安心养猪的战士养起猪来劲头也足了。他们说：“我们要向政委学习呵！”就这样，这九十多口猪再没有死亡了。
    有一次，我出差一个星期回来，跑到养猪场去，就看出那里又起了变化。在旧猪圈的前面，堆着一堆一堆的砖头，石灰，沙子，政委和战士们在砌猪圈。后来一了解，才知道政委给师党委提了个建议：为了使部队肉食自给，必须大力养猪；为了做到自繁自养，必须建立一个以产仔猪为主的养猪场。师党委同意了这个建议，这个养猪场就迅速地动工了。军官和士兵同志们，利用星期日和训练、工作的空隙时间，刨旧城砖、砍树，用自己辛勤的劳动，在这里盖起了十三排整整齐齐的猪舍。
    时间已经过去好几个月了。养猪场里已经养了三百二十四头优种母猪，二十五头优种公猪和几十头大肥猪，几十头杂交小猪。当我看到这片繁荣景象时，我怎能不想起政委当时养猪的情景，我怎能不爱我们的养猪场呢！（附图片）
