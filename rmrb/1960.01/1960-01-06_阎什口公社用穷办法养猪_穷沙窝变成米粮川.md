Yan Shiko Commune has barren soil. Before liberation, the grain harvested throughout the year was only enough to eat for two months. After liberation, through planting trees, afforestation, improving the soil, and building water conservancy projects, grain production increased year by year, but the increase was very small. In 1957, the yield per mu was only 182 jin, because of the lack of fertilizer. In 1959, a large number of pigs were raised, with sufficient fertilizer, and the grain yield per mu was as high as 471.5 jin. In addition to retaining sufficient rations, seeds, and feed grain, the commune overfulfilled the state's grain purchase task, and the income of the commune members also increased significantly.

How did Poor Sandy Land achieve high-speed development of pig raising? The main reasons were the strong determination and high enthusiasm of the leadership. They fully mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and used simple methods to solve various specific difficulties such as feed and funds in the development of pig production.

Yan Shiko Commune in Juancheng County, Shandong Province, through the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, has transformed this poor sandy land, which was previously covered in yellow dust all year round, into a land of rice and grain.

Yan Shiko Commune is located on the south bank of the Yellow River, with a total of 10,831 households and 113,196 mu of cultivated land. Before liberation, due to the breaching of the Yellow River, most of the fertile land was turned into sandy beaches. Only one season of beans or peanuts could be planted a year, and it had to be sown three to five times to become seedlings. The average yield per mu was only about 50 jin, and the grain harvested was only enough for two months of consumption.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, in order to change the poor face of the sandy area, tree planting and afforestation began in 1951 to prevent wind and fix sand. After cooperation and communization until now, the commune has built large areas of forest belts totaling 15,628 mu. Scattered tree planting in front of houses, at the head of villages, and in courtyards has reached 9.07 million trees, an average of 208 trees per person.

With the great development of forestry, the appearance of "yellow dust filling the sky when the wind blows" in this area has gradually changed, playing a role in preventing wind and fixing sand, protecting fields, and regulating the climate. After several years of soil improvement, coupled with the construction of water conservancy projects, 44,000 mu of sandy wasteland have now been turned into fertile land.

Relying on the Masses to Solve Difficulties

Planting trees, afforestation, improving the soil, and building water conservancy projects have increased grain production year by year; however, the increase was still small. By 1957, the yield per mu had only increased from 103 jin in 1952 to 182 jin, mainly due to the lack of fertilizer. Therefore, the Party committee led the masses to vigorously carry out the movement of raising pigs and accumulating manure.

The first difficulty encountered in raising a large number of pigs was the lack of feed; the second difficulty was the lack of funds and materials. In order to solve this problem, the Party committee first mobilized the masses to launch debates on issues such as "how to quickly increase production" and "can the difficulties in pig raising be solved," which further strengthened everyone's confidence and determination to greatly develop pig raising, and specifically studied ways to solve the problems of feed, funds, and materials. Everyone calculated an account: tree leaves alone can be collected more than 14 million jin, plus wild vegetables, crop leaves, etc., which can solve a large part of the pig feed; the difficulties of funds and materials can be solved by simple methods and mobilizing commune members to invest. Once ideological problems were solved, the masses were mobilized. Lin Chengyi, the secretary of the general branch of the Guo Laozhuang Brigade, lent out his savings of more than 20 yuan; a young couple from the Yan Shiko Brigade voluntarily supported the commune with materials from their three dilapidated houses; the 35 production brigades in the commune collected the required materials in three days. In this way, relying on self-reliance, the pig raising industry developed rapidly. By the end of October 1959, the commune had more than 11,100 pigs, reaching one pig per household, more than three times that of 1957. With the great development of pigs, draught animals and poultry have also greatly developed. By the end of October 1959, draught animals had developed to 3,645, one head per 31 mu of land; sheep had reached 16,203, half a head per household; and poultry had reached 41,530, four per household.

Mutual Promotion of Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry

The great development of animal husbandry has further promoted the great development of agriculture and forestry. In 1957, an average of 1,800 jin of fertilizer was applied per mu, and the average grain yield per mu was 182 jin; in 1958, an average of 2,500 jin of fertilizer was applied per mu, and the grain yield per mu increased to 283 jin; in 1959, an average of 5,000 jin of fertilizer was applied per mu, and the grain yield per mu increased to 471.5 jin. Before liberation, the grain harvested in one year was only enough for more than two months of consumption. In 1959, in addition to retaining 382 jin of rations per person, retaining sufficient seeds, and 1.21 million jin of feed grain, the commune also completed the grain purchase task of 6.13 million jin, exceeding the quota by 1.03 million jin. The income of the commune members has also increased significantly. The total income of the commune was 5.35 million yuan, an average of 121 yuan per person. After deducting accumulation, an average of 70 yuan was distributed per person.

The great development of pigs has also enabled the 4,152 mu of fruit tree forests and more than 600 mu of nurseries, which rarely received fertilizer, to receive more than 2,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. In previous years, unfertilized seedlings could only be taken out of the nursery after two years; now, with fertilization, they can be taken out of the nursery in the same year, and the seedlings grow taller and stronger. This commune has more than 300 mu of peach trees. In previous years, without fertilization, each mu yielded about 4,500 jin of peaches. This year, each mu was fertilized with 9,000 jin, and each mu yielded 12,000 jin of peaches. The combined development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry has turned the sandy wasteland into a green sea, the village roads are shaded by trees, the villages are filled with the sounds of cattle and horses, the pigs and sheep are fat and strong, and the courtyards are full of chickens and ducks, creating a new scene. Before liberation, 90% of the farmers in the commune lived in thatched houses, and now more than 70% of the commune members live in tile-roofed houses.

In order to better combine agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, they plan to develop draught animals to 6,000 heads in 1960, one head per 18 mu of cultivated land; develop pigs to 80,000 to 100,000, 0.7 to 0.9 heads per mu; develop sheep to 100,000, reaching two per person; reach 440,000 poultry, more than eight per person; plant trees and afforest 56,800 mu in contiguous areas, and plant trees on 2,700 mu of vacant land at the head of villages, an average of 800 trees per person; in agricultural production, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu is required to increase to 15,000 jin, and all cultivated land will be water conservancy-ized, ensuring a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and striving for 1,200 jin.

    阎什口公社用穷办法养猪
    穷沙窝变成米粮川
    阎什口公社土质贫瘠，解放前全年收的粮食只够两个月食用。解放后植树造林、改良土壤、兴修水利，粮食逐年增产，但增产幅度很小，1957年亩产只有一百八十二斤，原因是缺少肥料。1959年大量养猪，肥足，粮食亩产高达四百七十一斤半。全社除留足口粮、种子和饲料粮外，超额完成了国家的征购粮任务，社员收入也显著增加。
    穷沙窝是怎样高速度发展养猪的？主要是领导的决心大和干劲足。他们充分发动群众，依靠群众，用穷办法解决了发展养猪生产中的饲料、资金等各种具体困难。
    山东鄄城县阎什口公社，农、林、牧的综合发展，使这个以往终年黄土盖空的穷沙窝，变成了米粮川。
    阎什口公社位于黄河南岸，共一万零八百三十一户，耕地十一万三千一百九十六亩。解放前，因黄河决口使大部良田变成了沙滩，一年只能种植一季豆子或花生，而且还要播种三、五次才能成苗，每亩平均产量只有五十来斤，收的粮食只够两个多月的食用。
    解放后，在党和人民政府的领导下，为了改变沙区的贫穷面貌，于1951年就开始植树造林，防风固沙。经过合作化、公社化到现在，全社已造大片林带一万五千六百二十八亩。仅宅旁、村头、院内等零星植树就达到了九百零七万棵，平均每人合二百零八棵。
    随着林业的大发展，逐步改变着这一带“有风满天黄”的面貌，起到了防风固沙、保护田地和调节气候的作用。经过几年来改良土壤，加上兴修水利，现在全社有四万四千亩沙荒变成了良田。
    依靠群众解决困难
    植树造林，改良土壤，兴修水利，使粮食产量逐年增加；但是增产的幅度还是很小的，到1957年亩产量才由1952年的一百零三斤增加到一百八十二斤，主要原因是肥料缺乏。因此，党委便领导群众大力开展养猪积肥运动。
    大量养猪，遇到的第一个困难是缺乏饲料；第二个困难是缺乏资金、物料。为了解决这一个问题，党委首先发动群众，就“怎样才能很快提高产量”“养猪中的困难能不能解决”等问题展开了辩论，使大家进一步坚定了大量发展养猪的信心和决心，具体研究了解决饲料、资金、物料等问题的办法。大家算了一个账：仅树叶就可采集一千四百多万斤，再加上野菜、庄稼叶子等，就能解决一大部分猪的饲料；资金和物料的困难，可靠穷办法和发动社员投资解决。思想问题解决了，群众发动起来了。郭老庄大队总支书记林成义，将自己的储蓄借出了二十多元；阎什口大队一对青年夫妇自愿把三间破屋的物料支援公社；全社三十五个生产大队，在三天内就把所需的物料凑齐。就这样依靠自力更生，使养猪事业迅速地发展起来。到1959年10月底，全社已有猪一万一千一百多头，达到了每户一头猪，比1957年增加了三倍多。随着猪的大发展，耕畜、家禽也大大发展了。到1959年10月底，耕畜已发展到三千六百四十五头，合三十一亩地一头；羊一万六千二百零三只，一户合一只半；家禽四万一千五百三十只，一户合四只。
    农林牧相互促进
    畜牧业的大发展，又进一步地促进了农、林的大发展。1957年平均每亩施肥一千八百斤，粮食平均亩产一百八十二斤；1958年平均每亩施肥二千五百斤，粮食亩产增加到二百八十三斤；1959年平均每亩施肥五千斤，粮食亩产增加到四百七十一斤半。解放前，一年收的粮食只够两个多月的食用，1959年全社除每人留口粮三百八十二斤，留足种子和一百二十一万斤饲料粮外，还完成征购粮任务六百一十三万斤，超额一百零三万斤。社员的收入也显著增加，全社共收入五百三十五万元，平均每人一百二十一元，除留积累等外，平均每人分配七十元。
    猪的大发展，使很少施肥的四千一百五十二亩果树林和六百多亩苗圃，也每亩施肥两千多斤。往年，没有施肥的树苗，两年才能出圃；如今施上了肥，当年就能出圃，而且树苗长的更高更壮。这个社有三百多亩桃树，往年没施肥，每亩结桃四千五百斤左右，今年每亩施上九千斤肥，每亩结桃一万二千斤。农、林、牧三者结合发展，使沙荒变绿海，村道树成荫，庄庄牛马叫，猪羊肥又壮，鸡鸭满庭园，一片新景象。全社解放前90％农户住的是草房，现在70％以上的社员住上了瓦房。
    为了使农、林、牧结合的更好，他们计划1960年耕畜发展到六千头，十八亩耕地一头；猪发展到八万头到十万头，每亩零点七头到零点九头；羊发展到十万只，达到每人两只；家禽达到四十四万只，每人八只多；成片植树造林五万六千八百亩，村头等空闲地植树二千七百亩，平均每人达到八百棵；在农业生产上，要求每亩施肥量增加到一万五千斤，全部耕地实现水利化，保证每亩产量一千斤，争取一千二百斤。
