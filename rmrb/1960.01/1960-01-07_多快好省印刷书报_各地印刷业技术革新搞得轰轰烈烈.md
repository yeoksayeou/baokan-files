	Printing Books and Newspapers Quickly, Well, and Economically
	Technical Innovation in the Printing Industry Sweeps Across Various Regions

	(Reported by our newspaper) In order to rapidly improve the technological level of China's printing industry, print newspapers and books more, faster, better, and more economically, and fully meet the needs of the broad masses for cultural life, the printing industry in various regions has actively mobilized the masses and carried out thousands of technical innovations, greatly improving production levels.

	Since the Great Leap Forward, the technical innovation movement in the printing industry in various regions has been developing more vigorously. Aiming at the key and weak links in production, the printing industry in various regions generally regards the rapid realization of mechanization of binding and typesetting, and the improvement of letterpress printing quality as the focus of technical innovation.

	Judging from the advanced experience of various regions, the printing industry's adoption of the "walking on two legs" approach of combining indigenous and foreign methods to carry out technical innovation is an important way to achieve mechanization and automation quickly, well, and economically. The Shanghai No. 5 Printing Factory workers designed a paper folding machine themselves. The machine's frame and rollers are all made of wood, and only some important parts are made of steel. This can save about four-fifths of the steel. The efficiency of this paper folding machine has reached more than 3,000 sheets per hour. One paper folding machine can replace the workload of four or five workers. The Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory improved a Wan Nian type-casting machine by making slight improvements only in the mold loading and type output sections. This allows each worker to oversee three or four machines, increasing from the previous one machine. This machine is not only very easy to operate, and shortens auxiliary work time, but also saves 70% of copper material. Many printing factories in Hubei, Jiangsu, Shanghai and other places have modified their original printing presses. On the one hand, this greatly reduces the labor intensity of workers and improves production efficiency; on the other hand, because the mechanical operation is easy to master, it used to take one or two years to train a skilled worker, but now it only takes a few weeks. In Guangxi and other regions where the original printing industry was relatively weak, they have also recently relied on their own efforts to use indigenous methods to manufacture many mechanical equipments for themselves, which greatly reduces the heavy labor of workers and doubles production.

	Due to the development of the technical innovation movement in the printing industry in various regions, the printing quality has also been improved unprecedentedly. In the past, when using color plates to print various pictures, many fine lines were manually touched up little by little, which was time-consuming and unnatural. Recently, some printing factories and experimental institutions in Beijing, Shanghai and other regions have successfully researched a layered exposure method, which completely solves this problem. The quality of pictures printed by this method is greatly improved, and the labor time is greatly reduced. The exquisite picture album published in Beijing before the National Day was made using this method of platemaking. In the past, some cadres believed that there was nothing to innovate in old machines, and the technical innovation movement in some factories was lukewarm. But the facts prove that some old machines can also be innovated. The Beijing Trademark Printing Factory is a factory merged from fifty-six small factories, with only more than ninety simple machines. They automated many disc machines, and the output immediately increased by more than 50%. After the Tianjin No. 1 Printing Factory broadly aired their views, posted big-character posters, and criticized such ideas as "there is not much benefit in innovating old machines" and "technical innovation cannot solve the immediate problem" at the beginning of last year, cadres and the masses worked together and have already built more than fifty large and small machines to arm themselves. The degree of mechanization has increased from 60% in the first half of the year to more than 80%, and the production in the second half of the year has increased by more than 40% compared with the first half of the year.

    多快好省印刷书报
    各地印刷业技术革新搞得轰轰烈烈
    本报讯　为了迅速提高我国印刷工业的技术水平，把报纸书刊印得更多更快更好更省，充分满足广大人民对文化生活的需要，各地印刷业积极发动群众，进行了几千项的技术革新，大大提高了生产水平。
    大跃进以来，各地印刷业的技术革新运动已更加蓬勃开展起来。针对生产关键和薄弱环节，各地印刷业一般都把迅速实现装订、排字机械化和提高铅印质量作为技术革新的重点。
    从各地的先进经验来看：印刷工业采取土洋结合“两条腿走路”的方针大闹技术革新，是多快好省地实现机械化、自动化的重要道路。上海市印刷五厂职工们自己设计的一台折页机，机器的机架、辊筒全是木制的，只有一些重要部件采用钢材，这样就可以节约钢材五分之四左右，这台折页机的效率每小时达到了三千多张，一台折页机可以顶四、五个工人的工作量。北京新华印刷厂改进的一台万年铸字机，只在装模、出字两个部分稍加改进，就可以使每个工人从过去只能看一台提高到能看三、四台。这台机器不仅操作非常轻便，辅助工作时间缩短，而且可以节约70％的铜料。湖北、江苏、上海等地许多印刷厂把原来的印刷机加以改装，一方面大大减轻工人劳动强度，提高生产效率；一方面由于机械操作容易掌握，过去培养一个熟练工人要一两年，现在只要几个星期就行了。在原来印刷业基础较差的广西等地区，最近也自力更生地采用土办法制成了许多机械装备了自己，大大减轻了工人的繁重劳动，生产成倍提高。
    由于各地印刷业技术革新运动的开展，印刷质量也空前提高。过去用彩色版印刷各种图画时，有许多精细的线条都是用人工一点点修出来的，既费工时，又不自然。最近，北京、上海和其他地区的一些印刷厂和试验机构，研究成功一种分层曝光法，彻底解决了这个问题。采用这种方法印出来的图画质量大大提高，而劳动时间却大大减少。国庆节前，北京出版的精美画册，就是采取这种方法制版的。过去，曾有一些干部认为老机器没有什么好革新的，有的厂里技术革新运动冷冷清清。但是事实证明，有些老机器也可以革新，北京商标印刷厂是由五十六个小厂合并起来的工厂，只有九十多台简陋的机器；他们把许多圆盘机实现了自动化，产量马上提高50％以上。天津市第一印刷厂在去年年初通过大鸣大放，贴大字报，批判了“旧机器革新油水不大”、“技术革新远水救不了近火”等思想后，干部和群众一起动手，已经造出了大小机械五十多台，武装了自己，机械化程度已由上半年的60％提高到80％以上，下半年的生产比上半年增长40％以上。
