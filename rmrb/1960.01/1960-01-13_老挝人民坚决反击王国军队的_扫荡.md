Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 12th: "Lao Patriotic News" reported on January 8th that during December 1959, the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" in Laos ordered the Lao Royal Army to conduct "sweeping" operations in many parts of Laos, killing the people. However, they were met with resolute resistance from the people in these areas.

On December 28th last year, a battalion of the Royal Army was counterattacked by local guerrillas in Pak and Lao Bao, Sam Neua Province. The battle lasted for a day and a night, resulting in twenty government soldiers killed and ten wounded. On the same day, guerrillas in Bon Don and Muong Ai, north of Sam Neua, intercepted advancing government troops, killing and wounding nine government soldiers.

On December 24th last year, when the Royal Army was looting livestock from the people in the Muong Ai area of Sam Neua Province, they stepped on landmines planted by the militia, killing one government soldier and wounding two.

In Attapeu Province, on December 20th last year, approximately one platoon of the Royal Army stationed in the Muang Mai area robbed and destroyed the people's property. They were surrounded by local armed forces and encountered resistance in the Sak area (fifteen kilometers from Muang Mai). As a result of the battle, the Royal Army fled in disarray, and some government soldiers were forced to surrender. The guerrillas also captured twenty-three government soldiers, including one company commander and four secret agents. In addition, they seized twenty-five rifles.

On December 10, 1959, the Royal Army conducting "sweeping" operations in Na Song village, Khammouane Province, was attacked by guerrillas, and one government soldier was killed. On the 11th of the same month, guerrillas threw hand grenades at a group of Royal Army soldiers who were robbing cattle in the Na Po area of Khammouane Province, killing two government soldiers.

In Savannakhet Province, on December 8th last year, guerrillas intercepted a group of Royal Army soldiers heading for "sweeping" operations in the Hui Mun area, killing two government soldiers and wounding one.
