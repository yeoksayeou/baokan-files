    Speech on Supporting the Appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to Parliaments and Governments of All Countries on the Issue of Disarmament
    Delivered on January 21, 1960, at the Enlarged Meeting of the Twelfth Session of the Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress
    Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs
    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, at its fourth session, adopted on January 15 this year, based on the proposal made by Comrade Khrushchev on behalf of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the law on the further substantial reduction of the armed forces of the Soviet Union. According to this law, the Soviet Union will once again unilaterally reduce its armed forces by one-third, namely 1.2 million people, and will reduce the armaments of the army and navy, and cut military expenditures. At the same time, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union also adopted an appeal to the parliaments and governments of all countries in the world, calling on all countries to jointly disarm and ensure world peace. This new disarmament measure and initiative of the Soviet Union once again proves the sincerity of the Soviet government and people in safeguarding peace and their strong confidence in their own strength. Therefore, it has been warmly welcomed and unanimously supported by all peace-loving countries and people in the world.
    The Soviet Union has consistently advocated general disarmament and has made unremitting efforts to achieve it. Since the end of World War II, the Soviet government has put forward disarmament proposals more than once and has continuously demonstrated its sincere desire and determination to achieve disarmament with practical actions. Now, the Soviet Union has decided to once again reduce its armed forces to 2,423,000 people. This is already less than the amount of 2.5 million each for the armed forces of the Soviet Union and the United States as proposed by the United States, Britain, and France in 1956. This proactive measure taken by the Soviet Union will surely have a beneficial impact on easing international tensions.
    However, it must be seen that, contrary to the Soviet Union's consistent peace actions, the US ruling clique has been engaged in arms expansion, war preparations, and aggression, repeatedly obstructing the resolution of the disarmament issue, and has resisted and sabotaged every disarmament proposal put forward by the Soviet government in every possible way. It has even adopted a rogue attitude of reneging on its own so-called disarmament proposals that it was forced to put forward. Recently, the US ruling clique, under the pressure of the world's people demanding peace, has had to put on a peaceful posture, but in reality, it stubbornly adheres to the policy of arms expansion and war preparations, continuing to maintain military spending for the next fiscal year at the highest level in peacetime, concentrating all its efforts on accelerating the development and production of rockets, and actively establishing and expanding overseas missile base networks. The US President himself has also announced that the United States will resume nuclear weapons testing at any time. At the same time, the United States is still continuing to pursue the policy of dividing Germany and accelerating the arming of West Germany, making West German militarism the main pillar for the United States to launch aggressive wars in Europe. On January 19, the United States also signed the US-Japan military alliance treaty with the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government, openly reviving Japanese militarism and dragging Japan into a military aggression bloc. This is an extremely serious step by the United States to antagonize China and the Soviet Union, threaten Asian countries, and aggravate tensions in the Far East. Not only that, the US armed forces still occupy our territory of Taiwan, and the US air and naval forces, disregarding our repeated warnings, constantly violate our territorial waters and airspace. All of this proves that the "peace" posture made by the United States is only a cover for its policy of aggression and war. The people of the world cannot but be highly vigilant about this.
    Our government has always unswervingly pursued a peaceful foreign policy and has consistently advocated easing international tensions and general disarmament. It has always given firm support to the Soviet Union's successive proposals and measures on disarmament. On October 14, 1959, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress made a special resolution to support the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament. This decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the further substantial reduction of the armed forces of the Soviet Union and the appeal to the parliaments and governments of all countries in the world are major steps to promote general disarmament. Our government sincerely welcomes and supports this decision and initiative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.
    The Government of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly demonstrated its sincerity in safeguarding peace and achieving disarmament with practical disarmament actions. In the future, our government and people will continue to work with our great ally, the Soviet Union, and all other peace-loving countries and people, sparing no effort to wage an unyielding struggle for general disarmament and the defense of world peace. China is also willing to unhesitatingly undertake the international obligations it agrees to undertake. However, without the formal participation of the People's Republic of China and the signature of its representatives, the international agreement on disarmament will certainly not be binding on China. Now, on behalf of the State Council, I would like to submit to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for discussion the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries in the world, and to adopt a corresponding resolution to support this new disarmament measure of the Soviet Union and the peace initiative put forward in the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments and governments of all countries.

    关于支持苏联最高苏维埃就裁军问题致各国议会和政府呼吁书的发言
    一九六○年一月二十一日在第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会第十二次会议扩大会议上
    国务院副总理兼外交部长  陈毅
    苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议根据赫鲁晓夫同志代表苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会提出的建议，于今年1月15日通过了关于苏联再一次大量裁减武装部队的法案。根据这一法案，苏联将再次单方面地裁减武装部队三分之一，即一百二十万人，并且将裁减陆军和海军的军备，削减军事开支。同时，苏联最高苏维埃还通过了致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书，呼吁世界各国共同裁军，保障世界和平。苏联这一新的裁军措施和倡议，再一次证明了苏联政府和人民对于保障和平的诚意和对于自己力量的坚强信心，因此，受到了全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈欢迎和一致支持。
    苏联一贯主张普遍裁减军备，并且为其实现进行了不懈的斗争。第二次世界大战以后，苏联政府不止一次地提出了裁军建议，并且不断地以实际行动证明它实现裁军的真诚愿望和决心。现在，苏联又决定再一次把自己的武装部队裁减到二百四十二万三千人。这已经少于1956年美、英、法建议将苏美两国武装部队裁减到各为二百五十万人的数额。苏联采取的这一主动措施，对于和缓国际紧张局势必将发生有利影响。
    但是，必须看到，同苏联一贯的和平行动相反，美国统治集团却一直进行着扩军备战和侵略活动，一再阻挠裁军问题的解决，对苏联政府每次提出的裁军建议，百般抵制和破坏，甚至对他们自己被迫提出来的所谓裁军建议，也采取了出尔反尔的无赖态度。近来，美国统治集团受到全世界人民要求和平的压力，不得不装出和平的姿态，实际上仍然顽固地坚持扩军备战政策，把下一财政年度的军费继续保持在和平时期的最高水平，集中全力加速发展火箭的制造和生产，积极建立和扩大海外的导弹基地网。美国总统还亲自宣布美国将随时恢复核武器试验。同时，美国仍在继续推行分裂德国和加速武装西德的政策，使西德军国主义成为美国在欧洲发动侵略战争的主要支柱。1月19日，美国又同日本岸信介政府签订了日美军事同盟条约，公然复活日本军国主义，把日本拖入军事侵略集团，这是美国敌视中苏、威胁亚洲各国和加剧远东紧张局势的一个极其严重的步骤。不但如此，美国的武装力量至今还霸占着我国的领土台湾，美国的海空军不顾我国的多次警告，不断地侵犯我国的领海和领空。所有这一切，都证明了美国所作的“和平”姿态，只不过是为它的侵略政策和战争政策打掩护。全世界人民都不能不对此提高警惕。
    我国政府始终不渝地奉行着和平外交政策，一贯主张和缓国际紧张局势，普遍裁军；对于苏联历次关于裁减军备的建议和措施，一向给予坚决的支持。1959年10月14日，全国人民代表大会常务委员会曾专门作出决议，支持苏联政府关于全面彻底裁军的建议。这次苏联最高苏维埃关于苏联再一次大量裁减武装部队的决定和致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书，是促进普遍裁军的重大步骤，我国政府衷心地欢迎和支持苏联最高苏维埃的这次决定和倡议。
    中华人民共和国政府已经一再以实际的裁军行动表现了自己对维护和平和实现裁军的诚意。今后我国政府和人民仍将同我们的伟大盟邦苏联和其他一切爱好和平的国家和人民一道，不遗余力地为争取普遍裁军和保卫世界和平而进行不屈不挠的斗争。中国并且愿意毫不犹豫地承担起它同意承担的国际义务。但是，如果没有中华人民共和国的正式参加和它的代表的签字，有关裁军的国际协议当然不能对中国具有任何约束力。现在，我代表国务院提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会讨论苏联最高苏维埃致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书，并且通过相应的决议，支持苏联这一新的裁军措施和苏联最高苏维埃致各国议会和政府呼吁书中所提出的和平倡议。
