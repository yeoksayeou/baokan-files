    First Shot of the Year
    Li Junde, worker at the Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory
    The first shot of the year,
    Sounds magnificent,
    Where the cannon sounds, flowers bloom profusely,
    Ten thousand purples and reds urge the arrival of spring.
    The first shot of the year,
    A chorus of praise and laughter,
    Thousands of miles of red flags flutter in the wind,
    Myriad miles of triumphant songs resound through the clouds.
    The first shot of the year,
    Strikes red waves ten thousand feet high,
    Strikes with a stream of good news,
    The whole country rejoices with even greater vigor.
    The first shot of the year,
    The beautiful rivers and mountains are illuminated by red light,
    Happy cannons foreshadow new victories,
    The giant dragon of the East heads straight for new goals.

    开门头一炮
    北京广播器材厂工人　李俊德开门头一炮，打的呱呱叫，炮声起处花怒放，万紫千红催春到。开门头一炮，一片赞歌一片笑，千里红旗迎风展，万里凯歌贯云霄。开门头一炮，打的红涛万丈高，打的捷报滚滚来，举国欢腾劲更高。开门头一炮，锦绣河山红光照，喜炮预兆新胜利，东方巨龙直奔新目标。
