　　Creatively Running Party Schools

　　There are many ways to cultivate and improve cadres. Running Party schools is one of them. Now, the Nanfeng County Party Committee in Jiangxi Province has adopted the method of running Party schools in the countryside, combining study, productive labor, and grassroots work experience. This is a creative method of running Party schools and a good method for training grassroots cadres in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

　　In implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune movement, the vast majority of the Party's grassroots cadres have been diligent, dedicated, selfless, and devoted to the collective. They have shared weal and woe with the masses, taken the lead in hard work and skillful work, and won brilliant achievements in agricultural production. However, in the situation of the Great Leap Forward, and in the face of constantly emerging new things, they are all eager to improve their political and ideological level and improve their leadership skills, so as to play a greater and better leadership role and meet the needs of the great situation; and meet the requirements and expectations put forward by the Party and the people. Therefore, doing a good job in training grassroots cadres in a timely manner has become one of the important tasks of party organizations in various places. The Nanfeng County Party School attached importance to this work, and created the method of running Party schools in the countryside, enabling more than 1,000 grassroots cadres to be universally improved in one year. Studying in such a Party school, as Dai Zhengyan said, is "three months of study in the Party school is better than ten years of closed-door study." Adopting a creative method of running Party schools makes it possible to more effectively improve the political, ideological, and leadership level of grassroots cadres in a short period of time, further exert the core leadership role of grassroots cadres in rural work, and powerfully guarantee the continuous leap forward in agricultural production.

    创造性地办党校
    培养和提高干部的方式方法是多种多样的。办党校是多种方法之一。现在，江西南丰县委采取下乡办党校的方法，把学习、生产劳动和作基层工作的锻炼统一起来，是一种创造性的办党校方法，是多快好省培训基层干部的良好方法。
    在贯彻执行党的社会主义总路线、大跃进、人民公社运动中，党的基层干部绝大部分是勤勤恳恳、全心全意、公而忘私、舍己为群的。他们和群众同甘共苦，带头苦干巧干，夺得了农业增产的光辉成就。但是，他们在大跃进的形势下，在不断出现的新事物面前，都迫切要求提高政治思想水平，提高领导工作水平，以便发挥更大更好的领导作用，赶上大好形势的需要；并符合党和人民群众对他们提出的要求和期望。因此，及时地作好培训基层干部的工作就成为各地党组织的重要工作之一。南丰县委党校重视了这一工作，就创造了下乡办党校的方法，一年间使一千多名基层干部得到了普遍提高。在这样的党校里学习，正如戴征焱说的“党校学习三个月，胜读十年闭门书”。采取创造性地办党校的方法，就有可能在短期内更有效地提高基层干部的政治、思想和领导水平，进一步发挥基层干部在农村工作中的核心领导作用，有力地保证农业生产的持续跃进。
