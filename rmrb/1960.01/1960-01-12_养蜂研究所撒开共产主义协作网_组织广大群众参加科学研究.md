The Bee Research Institute Spreads Communist Cooperation Network
Organizes Broad Masses to Participate in Scientific Research

(Our reporter Hong Helin reports) How can scientific research work be done more, faster, better, and more economically? The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences' Bee Research Institute provides a good experience: implement the mass line and practice communist cooperation.

The Bee Research Institute is a new institution that was born in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958 to meet the needs of the development of the beekeeping industry. At the beginning, in addition to the director, there were only two or three researchers who had never kept bees and only had some book knowledge. However, they adhered to putting politics in command and implementing the mass line, and adopted a "walking on two legs" approach to cooperate with relevant units across the country. In one year, they rapidly formed a national beekeeping scientific research cooperation network with the institute as the center, combining mass research with expert research. At present, the institute has 132 cooperative units, covering 22 provinces and cities. In addition to beekeeping production units and scientific research departments, it also includes more than 20 departments in different professions such as people's communes, agricultural leadership agencies, schools, hospitals, and orchards, of which people's communes and state-owned bee farms account for 55%. Among the more than 400 participants in the collaboration, there are experts, professors, as well as workers, farmers, cadres, doctors, students, and shop assistants. In the past year, a group of specially invited researchers with rich experience and a certain level of theoretical knowledge has emerged. Therefore, some people say: It seems that there are very few researchers at the Bee Research Institute, but in reality there are many researchers.

At the beginning, the Bee Research Institute estimated that the research reports in 1959 would be no more than 20 or 30. However, in the past year, while establishing a cooperative network and carrying out research, the cooperative units have put forward 65 research reports that are closely related to production, theoretical, and practical, and some of the reports have reached a fairly high scientific level. The high-yield reports on bees, honey, and wax submitted by the Fengxi Beekeeping Team of Zhaiqi People's Commune in Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, and other units shattered the saying that "increasing bee colonies cannot produce more honey, and producing more honey cannot produce beeswax" for many years, and provided the experience and technical measures for "large-scale high yield" of 177 bee colonies in the entire team, with an average honey production of 323 jin per colony. At present, the average honey production per bee colony in my country is more than 40 jin, and the high-yield record of the Fengxi Beekeeping Team of the Zhaiqi People's Commune is eight times this average production. Reports from Beijing, Shanghai, Fujian, Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong and other places on the experiment of using bees to pollinate crops confirmed that after bee pollination, rapeseed increased production by 24.5% to 67%, sunflower increased production by 34% to 50%, cotton increased production by 32.3%, buckwheat increased production by 25% to 50%, and apples, oranges, and lychees also received significant increases in production.

The experience of the Bee Research Institute in the past year has proved that the process of realizing cooperation is a process of continuous struggle between two roads and two methods in scientific research work. This "poor and blank" research institute encountered the problem of "open-door research or closed-door research" as soon as it was established. The Party organization of the institute called for following the mass line and developing cooperation. Individual researchers always believed in themselves more than they believed in the masses. Therefore, the research institute launched a debate on "how much power do we really have?" After the debate, everyone initially clarified that "listening to the Party, following the mass line, and engaging in large-scale cooperation" would have power. At this time, the Bee Research Institute began to cooperate with relevant units across the country, and soon established links with more than 30 units. After the initial opening of the cooperation situation, the problem of regarding following the mass line and cooperation as an "expedient measure" occurred. Although a few people verbally agreed to cooperation, they still thought in their minds that "when they have 'capital' in the future, they will do it themselves," and even had the idea of ​​selecting talents from other units through cooperation to enrich themselves. In subsequent work, the director led everyone to consciously criticize this view of "using" the masses and "using" cooperation, and further realized that: "If you want to cooperate, you can't have any selfishness."

As the cooperation network gradually expanded, the cooperative units raised various theoretical and practical issues that required answers, and sent many specimens for identification. Some researchers again complained that "the scientific level of the masses is low," felt that "answering the questions of the masses is too troublesome," and doubted "can the days of cooperation really go on?" In response, the Party organization of the Bee Research Institute continued to focus on political and ideological education while further strengthening the organizational leadership of national cooperation. At that time, the researchers could not figure out the source of the bee jujube flower disease, but the old beekeeping workers found six or seven laws of jujube flower disease based on their own observations and experiences. The leadership used these facts to educate everyone to recognize the wisdom of the masses. The researchers who had originally doubted whether the workers could master the law of royal jelly production also put down their airs and experimented with the workers. As a result, the royal jelly production exceeded the planned target by two-thirds, and the number of honey bees producing royal jelly also doubled. This overturned the conventional wisdom in the minds of this researcher: producing royal jelly will affect bee colony reproduction.

Adapting to the increasing research business, the Bee Research Institute established a cooperation guidance group and sent special personnel to more than a dozen provinces to uniformly arrange the common research topics proposed by various cooperative units. It also formed more than a dozen thematic research cooperation groups with relevant parties to help formulate research plans and design plans, and implement each research topic to the units and hosts. Subsequently, the Bee Research Institute systematically supplied materials, focused on holding on-site research cooperation meetings, and specifically solved problems in research work, so that mass scientific research work could be carried out quickly and practically in a short period of time. After such organizational work, more than a dozen new contact centers were formed outside the Bee Research Institute, and the original more than 30 cooperation points continued to expand in depth to more than 100 with these cooperation groups as the center. Hospitals and universities outside the beekeeping profession also joined in. As the flowers of cooperation blossomed everywhere, the leadership was strengthened. With the strong support and assistance of the Party committees of the cooperative units in various places, the topics of bee mite disease, medical royal jelly, clinical experiments on bee venom, and bee pollination, which the Bee Research Institute could not study on its own, quickly achieved results. Contrary to some people's worries that "masses will be chaotic when they move," the number of cooperative units increased rapidly, and a new cooperative order was established following closely. It is not that "the larger the surface, the more difficult it is to handle," but that the cooperative network is becoming more and more interconnected, and is becoming more and more sound and consolidated day by day.

The experience of the Bee Research Institute proves that implementing the mass line and developing cooperation has opened up infinitely broad prospects for scientific research. Contrary to some people's concerns, developing cooperation has not made experts useless. While carrying out mass scientific research work last year, the Bee Research Institute also completed important experiments such as high-yield royal jelly and bee hybridization. The number of personnel in the institute has developed nearly twice, and a group of researchers who can stand alone has been trained. This year, the institute plans to complete 17 new research topics such as "high-yield and bumper harvest" and "technological innovation in feeding and management" on the basis of further expanding the cooperation network, so that the level of science and technology will continue to leap forward.

    养蜂研究所撒开共产主义协作网
    组织广大群众参加科学研究
    本报讯　记者洪和临报道：科学研究工作怎样才能做到多快好省，中国农业科学院养蜂研究所提供了好的经验，这就是：贯彻群众路线，实行共产主义协作。
    养蜂研究所是在1958年工农业生产大跃进中适应养蜂事业发展需要而诞生的新机构。开始时，除了所长以外，只有两三名没有养过蜂、仅有些书本知识的研究人员。但是他们坚持政治挂帅和贯彻群众路线，实行“两条腿走路”，同全国有关单位大协作，在一年中就从无到有、从小到大，以本所为中心迅速形成了全国性的养蜂科学研究协作网，把群众的研究同专家的研究结合起来。目前，这个研究所的协作单位已经有一百三十二个，遍及二十二个省市，除了养蜂生产单位和科学研究部门参加以外，还包括人民公社、农业领导机关、学校、医院、果园等二十多个不同专业的部门，其中人民公社和国营蜂场占55％。参加协作的四百多人中，有专家、教授，还有工人、农民、干部、医师、学生和店员等。一年来已经涌现出一批经验丰富、也有一定理论水平的特约研究员。因此有人说：看来养蜂研究所研究人员很少，实际上研究人员很多。
    开始时，养蜂研究所估计1959年的研究报告顶多不过二、三十篇。可是一年来在边建立协作网、边开展研究的情况下，各协作单位就提出了六十五篇密切结合生产、有理论、有实际的研究报告，一部分报告达到了相当高的科学水平。浙江省桐庐县窄溪人民公社养蜂队等单位提出的蜂、蜜、腊三高产报告，粉碎了多少年来“增殖蜂群就不能多产蜜、多产蜜就不能生产蜂腊”的说法，提供了全队一百七十七群蜂“大面积丰产”的经验和技术措施，平均每群蜂产蜜三百二十三斤。目前我国每群蜂的平均产蜜量是四十多斤，窄溪人民公社养蜂队这一高产纪录是这一平均产量的八倍。北京、上海、福建、黑龙江、江西、广东等地关于用蜜蜂给农作物授粉的实验的报告证实，经过蜜蜂授粉以后，油菜增产24．5％到67％，向日葵增产34％到50％，棉花增产32．3％，荞麦增产25％到50％，苹果、桔柑、荔枝也收到显著的增产效果。
    养蜂研究所一年来的经验证明，实现协作的过程是在科学研究工作中不断进行两条道路、两种方法斗争的过程。这个“一穷二白”的研究所刚成立，就遇到了“开门研究还是关门研究”的问题。研究所党组织号召走群众路线，开展协作。个别研究人员总是相信自己超过相信群众。于是，研究所就展开了一场“我们的力量究竟有多大”的辩论。经过辩论，大家初步明确了“听党的话，走群众路线，大搞协作”就有力量。这时养蜂研究所开始同全国有关单位协作，不久就同三十多个单位挂上了钩。协作局面初步打开以后，又发生了把走群众路线和协作看成“权宜之计”的问题。少数人虽然口头上赞同协作，思想里仍然认为“将来有了‘资本’还是自己干”，甚至还有通过协作从其他单位挑选人才充实自己的想法。在以后的工作中，所长带动大家自觉地批判了这种“利用”群众、“利用”协作的观点，进一步认识到：“要协作就不能有半点私心”。
    协作网逐步扩展，协作单位提出了各种理论和实际问题要求解答，寄来许多标本请求鉴定。有的研究人员又埋怨起“群众科学水平低”，感到“解答群众的问题太麻烦”，怀疑“协作的日子究竟能不能过下去？”对此，养蜂研究所的党组织一方面继续抓紧政治思想教育工作，一方面进一步加强全国协作的组织领导。当时研究人员们对蜜蜂枣花病的病源百思不得其解，养蜂老工人却根据自己的观察、体验，找出了六、七条枣花病发病规律。领导上就根据这些事实教育大家认识群众的智慧。原来曾经怀疑工人能否掌握好王浆生产规律的研究人员，也放下架子同工人一起实验，结果王浆产量超过了预定计划三分之二，产王浆的蜜蜂还增殖一倍。这就推翻了这位研究人员头脑中的常规：生产王浆就要影响蜂群繁殖。
    适应着研究业务日益开展的情况，养蜂研究所建立了协作指导组，派专人到十多个省去，对各协作单位提出的共同研究题目进行统一安排。并且汇同各有关方面组成十多个专题研究协作组，帮助制定研究计划和设计方案，把每项研究题目都落实到单位和主持人。随后，养蜂研究所又有计划地供应资料，重点召开研究协作现场会议，具体解决研究工作中的问题，使群众性的科学研究工作在短期内迅速、踏实地开展起来。经过这样的组织工作，就在养蜂研究所以外又形成了十多个新的联系中心，原有的三十多个协作点以这些协作组为中心继续向纵深扩展到一百多个，养蜂专业以外的医院、高等学校也都参加进来。协作之花遍地开，领导加强了。在各地协作单位的党委大力支持和帮助下，养蜂研究所自力无法研究的蜂螨病、医用王浆、蜂毒临床实验、蜜蜂授粉等题目迅速获得了成果。同有些人的“群众动起来就要乱”的担心完全相反，协作单位迅速增加了，一套新的协作秩序也紧跟着建立起来。不是“面越大越不好办”，而是协作网越来越脉络贯通，一天比一天健全、巩固了。
    养蜂研究所的经验证明，贯彻群众路线，开展协作，为科学研究开拓了无限广阔的前途。同有些人的顾虑相反，开展协作，并没有使专家无用武之地。养蜂研究所去年在开展群众性科学研究工作的同时，还完成了王浆高产、蜜蜂杂交等项重要实验，全所人员发展了将近两倍，培养出一批能够独当一面的研究人员。这个研究所今年准备在进一步扩展协作网的基础上，完成“高额丰产”、“饲养管理技术革新”等十七个新的研究题目，使科学技术水平继续跃进。
