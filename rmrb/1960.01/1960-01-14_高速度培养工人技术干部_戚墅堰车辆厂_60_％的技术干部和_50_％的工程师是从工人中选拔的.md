The main methods: Running spare-time Party schools and political theory study classes to continuously improve workers' political awareness; adopting various forms to organize workers to study culture and improve their cultural level; organizing various technical studies according to the principle of "learning what you do, and supplementing what you lack"; conscientiously implementing the system of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," and absorbing qualified workers to participate in workshop management and technical research, gradually improving their leadership ability and technical level.

Nanjing, January 13th (reporter from this newspaper) The Party organization of the Qishuyan Rolling Stock Plant in Jiangsu Province has consistently attached importance to actively training and selecting technical cadres with both ability and integrity from the ranks of workers. Over 60% of the plant's existing technical cadres have been selected and trained from the workers. Among them, forty-six engineers were selected from the workers, accounting for more than 50% of the plant's existing engineers.

With the vigorous development of the country's socialist construction, the Qishuyan Rolling Stock Plant is also constantly developing and growing. Since 1958, in particular, the number of workers in the plant has increased from more than 4,000 to more than 10,000, adding eight workshops, branches, and branch factories, and correspondingly increasing some offices. In terms of production, in addition to manufacturing general locomotives and rolling stock, it is also responsible for the trial production and production of new products such as "internal combustion locomotives" and "hydraulic transmission internal combustion locomotives." According to the principle of old factories supporting new factories and large factories supporting small factories, this factory also needs to transfer technical cadres to other factories. The development of the objective situation requires the factory to add a large number of technical cadres. The factory's Party committee adopted the method of "walking on two legs" to solve the difficulty of insufficient technical cadres. In addition to relying on the state to allocate graduates from universities and colleges, it also relies on its own efforts to train and select technical cadres from the workers. In the past ten years, 489 technical cadres have been trained and selected from the workers. This ensures the continuous growth in the number of technical cadres in the factory, so that cadres can be assigned and production can start as soon as the construction of the new workshop is completed. At the same time, it has also strongly supported other factories.

The Qishuyan Rolling Stock Plant's large-scale selection of technical cadres is based on long-term and meticulous training and improvement of the workers. In terms of politics, all employees of the plant spend three mornings a week (one and a half hours each time) studying the Party's policies and guidelines. The Party committee also runs a spare-time Party school, and the workshops also run spare-time Party training classes, political theory study classes, and spare-time philosophy groups. More than 4,800 workers participate in these study organizations. Regular political education has continuously improved the workers' political awareness. They are energetic, eager to learn, and progressive, which prepares good political conditions for the selection of cadres. In terms of culture, the plant has established one factory school and fifteen workshop branch schools, forming a spare-time cultural education network from literacy to university, with more than 5,800 people participating in the study. Compared with the early days of liberation, the cultural level of all employees in the plant has decreased from 63% to 3% for illiteracy, increased from 25% to 47% for primary school level, increased from 7% to 36% for secondary school level, and increased from 5% to 14% for secondary technical school and university level. Among the more than 40 newly promoted worker engineers, more than 30 were originally illiterate or had only primary school education. In terms of technology, various technical studies are organized according to the principle of "learning what you do, and supplementing what you lack." For example, in 1958, when the number of apprentices increased a lot, the factory organized various study classes to help improve the apprentices' technical level, so that more than 95% of the apprentices had more formal learning opportunities. For technicians above level six, the method of part-work and part-study is adopted, and they are organized in batches to study technical theory. Up to now, the plant has opened more than 400 long-term and short-term technical study classes, and more than 34,000 workers and cadres have participated in the study. In addition, the technical level of workers and cadres is improved through organizing visits, exchanging experiences, mentors teaching apprentices, and guaranteeing teaching and learning.

In addition to improving workers' level through study, the factory Party organization also pays attention to cultivating and improving workers' level in practical work. First of all, the factory conscientiously implements the system of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." Each workshop consciously absorbs some workers who are ideologically progressive, active in work, willing to study their business, and have a certain cultural level to participate in workshop management and technical research, gradually improving their leadership ability and technical level, so that they can be promoted to technical cadres at an appropriate time. The nine technical cadres in the repair workshop and the power workshop were all cultivated and promoted in this way. In addition, some workers with potential for cultivation are boldly used to act as technical cadres or to do the work of technical cadres. In the work, give them more help, explain more methods, and check and supervise more. After practical exercise, when they are able to be competent for the position of technical cadre, they will be formally promoted.

In order to enable the technical cadres who have been promoted to better adapt to the needs of the development of the situation, the factory Party committee also allocates a certain amount of time each week for them to study technical theories such as mechanical drawing and metal materials, and systematically improve their technical theoretical level. When assigning tasks, the Party organization also pays attention to matching worker technical cadres with technical cadres from intellectuals, and calls on them to learn from each other and combine with each other.

According to production needs, this factory will also promote 200 technical cadres from workers this year.

    高速度培养工人技术干部
    戚墅堰车辆厂60％的技术干部和50％的工程师是从工人中选拔的
    主要办法：举办业余党校和政治理论学习班，不断提高工人的政治觉悟；采取各种形式，组织工人学习文化，以提高文化水平；根据“做什么学什么，缺什么补什么”的原则，组织各种技术学习；认真贯彻“两参、一改、三结合”的制度，吸收有条件的工人参加车间管理和技术研究工作，逐步提高他们的领导能力和技术水平。
    本报南京13日电　江苏省戚墅堰机车车辆工厂的党组织，长期以来一贯重视从工人群众中积极培养和大量选拔德才兼备的技术干部。全厂现有的技术干部，60％以上是从工人群众中选拔培养的。其中从工人群众中选拔的工程师，就有四十六名，占全厂现有工程师的50％以上。
    随着国家社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展，戚墅堰机车车辆工厂也不断发展壮大。特别是从1958年以来，全厂工人从四千多增加到一万多，增加了八个车间、分间和分厂，并相应地增加了一些科室。在生产方面，除了制造一般的机车车辆外，还担负着“内燃机车”、“液压传动内燃机车”等新产品的试制与生产任务。根据老厂支援新厂、大厂支援小厂的原则，这个厂还需要向其它厂输送技术干部。客观形势的发展，要求工厂必须增添大批技术干部。工厂党委采用“两条腿走路”的办法，来解决技术干部不足的困难。除了依靠国家调配大专学校的毕业生以外，同时自力更生，从工人群众中培养和选拔技术干部。十年来，从工人中培养选拔的技术干部，就有四百八十九名。这样，就保证了本工厂技术干部的数量不断增长，做到新车间基建一结束，就能配齐干部，开工生产。同时，也有力地支援了其它工厂。
    戚墅堰机车车辆工厂，大量选拔技术干部的工作，建立在对工人群众进行长期的、细致的培养，提高工作的基础上。在政治方面，全厂职工每周有三个早晨的时间（每次一个半小时），学习党的方针政策。党委还举办了业余党校，各车间也举办了业余党训班、政治理论学习班、业余哲学小组等学习组织。参加这些组织学习的工人达四千八百人以上。经常性的政治教育，使工人的政治觉悟不断提高。他们朝气蓬勃，好学上进，为选拔干部准备了良好的政治条件。在文化方面，全厂办了厂校一所，车间分校十五所，形成了从扫盲到大学的业余文化教育网，参加学习的有五千八百多人。现在全厂职工的文化水平，如与解放初期相比，文盲从63％下降到3％，高小程度的由25％提高到47％，中学程度的由7％提高到36％，中等技术学校和大学程度的由5％提高到14％。新提拔的四十多名工人工程师中，原来是文盲和只有高小文化水平的就有三十多人。在技术方面，根据“做什么学什么，缺什么补什么”的原则，组织各种技术学习。例如1958年徒工增加很多，工厂就组织了各种有助于提高徒工技术水平的学习班，使95％以上的徒工，都有了较正规的学习机会。对于六级以上的技术工人，则采取半工半读的办法，分批组织他们学习技术理论。到目前为止，这个厂开办的长期和短期技术学习班，已达四百多个班次，参加学习的工人和干部，有三万四千多人次。此外，还通过组织参观、交流经验、师傅带徒弟、包教保学等方式方法，提高工人和干部的技术水平。
    工厂党组织除了通过学习提高工人的水平以外，还注意在实际工作中培养、提高工人的水平。首先，这个厂认真贯彻了“两参、一改、三结合”的制度。各车间都有意识地吸收一些思想进步、工作积极、肯钻研业务、有一定文化程度的工人，参加车间管理和技术研究工作，逐步提高他们的领导能力和技术水平，以便在适当时机，提拔他们为技术干部。机修车间和动力车间的九个技术干部，都是这样培养、提拔起来的。此外，对于一些有培养前途的工人，则大胆使用，让他们代理技术干部的职务，或者去作技术干部的工作。在工作中，对他们多帮助，多交代方法，多检查督促。经过实际锻炼，使他们能够胜任技术干部的职务以后，再正式提拔。
    为了使已经提拔起来的工人技术干部，能够更好地适应形势发展的需要，厂党委每周还划出一定的时间，让他们学习机械制图、金属材料等技术理论，系统地提高技术理论水平。在分配任务时，党组织还注意使工人技术干部和知识分子出身的技术干部搭配在一起，并号召他们互相学习，互相结合。
    根据生产需要，这个厂今年还将从工人中提拔二百个技术干部。
