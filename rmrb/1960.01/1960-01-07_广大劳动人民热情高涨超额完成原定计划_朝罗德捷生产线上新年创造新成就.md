Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 5th: North Korean workers, with the spirit of "riding the Chollima," have plunged into production in the first few days of the new year, and good news is constantly being reported.

The steelworkers of the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works increased their production of iron and steel by 14% and 17% respectively in the 1st and 2nd days of January, compared to the original plan. The steelworkers are determined to produce 130,000 tons more iron and 80,000 tons more steel this year than last year with the existing manpower and equipment.

The construction workers building Pyongyang are determined to build twice as many houses this year as last year. The ninth assembly work team of the Pyongyang Central District Construction Company, on the first day of the new year, changed the labor organization to a three-shift system, saving 10% of the labor force, and overfulfilled the plan for assembling foundations by 14% on that day.

The fishing workers fighting on the ocean are still braving the cold wind to fish in the new year. The workers of the Xihu Aquatic Products Enterprise have caught 389 tons more fish in the sea in the first three days of the new year than in the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, January 6th: The staff and workers of Romanian industrial and mining enterprises enthusiastically launched the new year's production competition and rationalization proposal movement. Since New Year's Day, many enterprises have reported production successes.

The steelworkers of the No. 3 open-hearth furnace in the second steelmaking workshop of the Hunedoara Metallurgical United Enterprise raised the planned index of the open-hearth furnace utilization coefficient by 16.5%. Some production teams produced a furnace of steel in seven and a half hours, making the utilization coefficient of the open-hearth furnace reach 9.39 tons. The steelworkers of the Red Steel Plant overfulfilled the plan by 30 tons of steel on the first day of this year. Up to the 4th, this factory had overfulfilled the plan by 200 tons of steel.

Cement plants in various places have also achieved good results in production since the beginning of this year. On the first day of this year, the Bacau Cement Plant and the Bicaz Cement Plant both overfulfilled the plan by 200 tons of cement. Many oil drilling teams in the Oltenia oil field have also overfulfilled their production plans in the first few days of the new year. The drilling team led by Enachescu drilled 30 meters more than planned on New Year's Day. Many light industry factories and chemical factories have also overfulfilled their production plans in recent days. For example, the "Argus" edible oil factory overfulfilled the plan by an average of 20 tons of edible oil per day.

In the rationalization proposal movement launched in various enterprises, the staff and workers have put forward many valuable suggestions, which have been adopted in production. For example, after adopting the suggestion of modifying the motor, the Iasi Textile Factory can produce 2,000 square meters more textiles every day.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 5th: The staff and workers of many enterprises in the German Democratic Republic have won a victory at the beginning of 1960 and achieved outstanding production achievements.

The iron-smelting workers of the Stalinstadt Iron and Steel Works smelted 3,866 tons of iron on the 2nd, creating the factory's highest iron output record.

The staff and workers of the Brandenburg Steel Plant greatly overfulfilled the steelmaking plan in the first four days of January. The steelworkers of this enterprise proposed a guarantee to produce 90,000 tons of steel per month in 1960.

The miners of the state-owned joint enterprises in the Leipzig district have also made great achievements in coal mining in recent days. The staff and workers of these enterprises overfulfilled the plans for coal mining and stripping by 27% and 42% respectively in the first three days of the new year.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 6th: The laboring people of Czechoslovakia began their work in 1960 with full confidence. At the beginning of the new year, the whole country was full of joy and energy. In order to successfully complete the tasks of the last year of the second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) and to welcome the 15th anniversary of liberation, workers and peasants throughout the country are advancing towards new victories with soaring enthusiasm and energetic energy under the slogan of "celebrating the memorable year with new achievements."

Since the first day of the new year, many factories have proposed guarantees to complete this year's production tasks ahead of schedule and ahead of schedule. Workers from 280 enterprises in the Prague region have put forward new guarantees. The workers of the famous Light Shoe Factory will adopt new technologies this year to complete the production task, which is 5% higher than last year. They also guarantee to save the country 15 million crowns (Czech currency) by promoting rationalization proposals in the new year. The workers of the largest machinery factory in Czechoslovakia, the Lenin Factory, increased the original 1960 output value plan by 94 million crowns. They boldly stated that they would use technological innovation and overall mechanization to complete the guarantees they proposed without increasing the supply of raw materials.

The coal miners who were at the forefront of production in 1959 also confidently put forward guarantees for 1960. For example, the workers of the Jirasek Coal Mine in Northern Bohemia decided to complete the second Five-Year Plan fifty days ahead of schedule. Workers at the Ostrava-Karvina Coal Mine guarantee to complete a week's work in five days.

The countryside is also full of the atmosphere of the New Year, and the farmers have already started preparations for spring plowing and sowing. From the first day of 1960, a large number of party member cadres have been dispatched from the central to local party organizations, people's committees at all levels, and agricultural departments to the countryside to carry out various tasks. They will live with the peasants in the countryside for a month to help state farms, agricultural cooperatives, and rural party organizations implement the decision of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party on striving for a decisive turning point in agriculture and animal husbandry. The measure of sending thousands of party cadres deep into the countryside has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the peasants. In addition, many agricultural experts and cadres in other fields will also go to the countryside one after another at the beginning of the year. They will work and settle in the countryside for a long time. They will go to state farms and agricultural cooperatives, especially to some backward cooperatives, to serve as party organization secretaries and various jobs to help the peasants achieve decisive victories in agricultural production in 1960.

Even at the very moment when the new year has just arrived, good news of overfulfilling the original production tasks has been continuously reported from the industrial and agricultural fronts of Czechoslovakia. For example, a workers' collective from the "Slovak National Uprising Factory" in Ziar City in the Slovak region produced 882 cubic meters of iron bauxite in the first shift of this year, exceeding the original plan by 57%. The metallurgical workers of the Sverma Steel Plant in Slovakia also overfulfilled their plan by 1% in the production of the first three shifts this year.
