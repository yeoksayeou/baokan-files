A New Milestone in Sino-Burmese Friendship
Premier Ne Win's Speech at the Farewell Banquet

Respected Premier Zhou Enlai, friends:

Premier, on the eve of my departure from your beautiful capital, I would like to express to you and all my friends that the warm welcome and hospitality extended to me and the members of our delegation by the Chinese government under your leadership and the Chinese people have made me very excited and moved. Since we entered the Chinese border, we have received very cordial care and reception, and I find it difficult to find appropriate words to express our deep gratitude. In this difficult situation, please allow me to simply, but sincerely and earnestly from the bottom of my heart, say to you: "Thank you for everything you have done to receive us."

Our stay in Beijing coincided with your Spring Festival, which enabled us to celebrate this festival together with our great Chinese neighbors, relatives, and "Paukphaw". This is indeed a great blessing for us. I and my colleagues join in wishing the Chinese government and people peace, joy, and happiness during the festival.

Premier, one of the purposes of my visit this time was to discuss the Sino-Burmese border issue. During our short stay, we were able to conclude an agreement that almost completely resolved the border issue, which had been unresolved for nearly a century. This is due, on the one hand, to the political vision of the two governments, and on the other hand, to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. During our stay, we also negotiated and signed a Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression, which is, in fact, an extension of the Five Principles. I believe that the conclusion of the above agreements and treaties will be recorded in history as a new milestone in Sino-Burmese relations. They will not only further deepen the traditional friendship between our two countries, but will undoubtedly play a huge role in consolidating and further strengthening friendly cooperation between the two countries. This is a major event. This moment of completing the signing of the Sino-Burmese Border Agreement and the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship is a very auspicious moment, so please allow me to propose a toast. Please join me in toasting:

To the eternal friendship between our two countries, to the ever-increasing understanding between the people of our two countries, to world peace, which is an essential condition for all progress and prosperity, to the happiness and increasing prosperity of the Chinese people, to the health and happiness of Premier Zhou Enlai and all members of the Government of the People's Republic of China, President Liu Shaoqi of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong, and other leaders of the People's Republic of China, Cheers!

### 中缅友好新的里程碑  奈温总理在告别宴会上的讲话

    中缅友好新的里程碑
    奈温总理在告别宴会上的讲话尊敬的周恩来总理阁下，朋友们：
    总理先生，在我离开贵国美丽的首都的前夕，我愿向你和所有的朋友们表示，你所领导的中国政府以及中国人民对我和我们访问团的成员们所给予的热烈的欢迎和盛情的款待，使我非常兴奋和感动。从我们进入中国国境以来，我们受到了十分亲切的关心和接待，我很难找到适当的话来表达我们对此的深切的感激心情。在这种为难的情况下，请让我简单地，可是从心底里十分恳切地对你们说：“谢谢你们为接待我们所做的一切”。
    我们在北京的逗留恰好碰上你们的春节，使我们能够同我们伟大的中国邻居、亲戚、“胞波”一起来欢庆这个佳节，对我们来说，这确实是很大的幸运。我和我的同事们一起，祝中国政府和人民节日安宁、欢乐和幸福。
    总理先生，我这次访问的目的之一就是讨论中缅边界问题。我们能在短促的逗留期间就缔结了差不多最后解决了近百年来一直无法解决的边界问题的协定。这一方面是由于两国政府的政治远见，同时也是由于有以和平共处为基础的五项原则。在我们逗留期间，我们还商谈和签订了友好和互不侵犯条约，这个条约事实上是五项原则的引伸。我相信上述协定和条约的缔结将作为中缅关系中的一个新的里程碑而永垂青史。它们不仅进一步加深了我们两国之间的传统友谊，而且无疑地将在巩固和进一步加强两国间的友好合作方面发挥巨大的作用。这是一个重大的事件。签订完毕中缅边界协定和中缅友好条约的这一时刻是非常良好吉祥的时刻，因此请允许我祝酒。请大家同我一起：
    为我们两国间的永恒的友谊，为我们两国人民间的日益增进的了解，为一切进步和繁荣所不可少的基本条件——世界和平，为中国人民的幸福和日益昌盛，为周恩来总理阁下和中华人民共和国政府全体成员，中华人民共和国主席刘少奇阁下，毛泽东主席和中华人民共和国其他领导人的健康和幸福，干杯！
