A Record of "Water争"
——Several Scenes from the Water Conservancy Construction Site of Shangyou Commune, Xinding County
By Our Correspondent Yang Yi

The new society has been completely renewed. The word “争水” (zhēng shuǐ – contending for water), which used to be unpleasant to hear, now has a new meaning. It is no longer a struggle between people as in the old society, but the liberated people conquering nature, contending with heaven and earth for water, and contending with mountains and rivers for water.

Recently, this reporter visited a commune at the foot of the Lüliang Mountains in northern Shanxi Province—Shangyou Commune. Here, one can see everywhere the revolutionary vigor and heroic spirit of the new type of farmers after communization who are vigorously transforming the landscape and contending for every drop of water.

Conquering Silt and Sand

Starting from the ancient city of Xinding County, the terrain rises higher and higher as you go east, truly rising step by step. Upon entering the territory of Shangyou Commune, a small basin surrounded by mountains immediately appears. The Yunzhong River, running through the entire area, flows northward along the terrain. From ancient times, this has formed an unsatisfactory situation: the high ground longs for water but the water does not go there, while the low-lying areas fear water but the water insists on coming. The farmers describe it as: "The high ground carries a red club (praying for rain), the low-lying areas have a good harvest; when the low-lying areas are worried, the high ground smiles." Generations of farmers have hoped to harness the Yunzhong River. The People's Commune has fulfilled people's thousand-year wish.

In less than a year, the masses here cut off the Yunzhong River and opened a man-made canal, two zhang (approximately 6.6 meters) wide, two to three zhang deep, and twenty-six li (approximately 13 kilometers) long. At the same time, they built large dams and reservoirs in the low-lying areas to raise the water level; they dug deep canals in the high ground to lower the channels, so that many small rivers and streams seeping out from the Yunzhong River would flow south instead of north, and flow to the high ground instead of the low-lying areas. Along the canal, five major water storage and regulation projects, such as Jinshan and Yinshan Lakes, were also built. Together with other projects, the entire commune has formed a water network that connects rivers to canals, canals to lakes, and lakes to reservoirs, combining drainage, storage, and irrigation. With the birth of these projects, huge fruits have been produced in all aspects. The low-lying wetlands along the artificial canal within 800 meters have been transformed into fertile fields, with an average yield of 290 jin (approximately 145 kilograms) of grain per mu (approximately 0.067 hectares) in 1959. The area benefiting is expanding, and it can expand the irrigated area by 200,000 mu. Now all the water lakes and ponds have been filled with water, there are fish in the water, and boats on the water. After the canal was officially opened, it was connected to the Xinding and Satellite man-made canals that run across the county. From Qicun, the location of the commune, by boat, one can not only travel all over the commune, but also all over the county.

This project was very arduous and was the first major water conservancy construction product of the Great Leap Forward, so it was named the Leap Forward Canal. In addition to the full undertaking of Shangyou Commune, nearby communes have continuously provided support. It lasted more than a year, used more than 800,000 labor days, excavated 1 million cubic meters of earth and stone, and the deepest part of the riverbed was about eleven meters. In the process of construction, several major battles were launched, the most arduous, the most famous, and the most representative was the last one, the silt and sand "fortress" battle. This battle took place in the autumn. When the river channel was excavated near the Qicun Tianchang Road, a layer of quicksand was suddenly encountered at a depth of more than three zhang. The deeper the excavation in the middle, the more silt and sand gushed out from both sides. At first, a large number of people were concentrated to dig, but overnight, it completely closed up. Later, it was simply dug and flowed away. Once, many commune members were digging silt and sand under the river channel, and hearing that the sound was not right, they hurriedly ran away. With a "boom!" sound, like a cliff collapsing, half a river channel of silt and sand flowed out. One commune member fell down to protect the tools and was rescued after a lot of trouble. How to overcome the four-li-long quicksand layer? This was a huge battle. Taking silt and sand, using shovels to shovel, thin silt could not be shoveled, and very little thick silt could be shoveled. Digging ditches on both sides of the river channel to reduce pressure could reduce the flow of silt and sand, but the workload was too large. Later, the commune members used high-altitude cranes to transport silt and sand on the one hand, and carried them in baskets on their shoulders on the other hand. During the operation, those participating in the construction were covered in mud because the high-altitude frames dripped and the baskets leaked. In order to increase the speed of transporting silt and sand, before the freezing, commune members stood in knee-deep mud and water to pass the silt baskets "hand to hand." In this way, they managed section by section, digging sand while driving wooden stakes and pressing willow branches on both sides to block the quicksand, and in one go, the 2,000-meter-long quicksand flow was initially brought under control.

Chiseling Mountains to 引龙泉 (Yǐn Lóngquán - Draw the Dragon Spring)

Recently, Shangyou Commune has spread news that has caused a sensation throughout the county: thirty-three commune members, working in a cave for twenty-two months, chiseled through a 250-meter-thick large stone mountain and diverted the river water behind the mountain to the front of the mountain.

This extraordinary feat occurred on Longquan Mountain in the Wencun Management Area, so this water diversion cave was named Longquan Cave. This area belongs to the Lüliang Mountains. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, the militia guerrillas of Wencun and Suncun relied on this mountain to fight against the enemy, and people regarded it as close as a mother. But now, carrying out production and construction, it blocks several flows of water, and people are increasingly aware that it is an object of conquest that hinders production. At the beginning of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Wencun Agricultural Cooperative Party Branch, after several surveys, selected a place where the mountain was thin and proposed a tunnel plan. At that time, some people thought it was too difficult and even regarded this project as a money-losing endeavor. After the project started, some people lost confidence even more when they saw the slow progress. However, the Party Branch was determined to open up this cave. With the strong support of the Party Branch, the construction workers stubbornly broke through the mountain ridge and diverted the water.

Most of the commune members in their thirties who participated in the mountain chiseling were militia from more than ten years ago, and many of them were guerrillas. The captain of the mountain chiseling team was the captain of the Wencun guerrillas, and the secretary of the management area Party branch was the captain of the Suncun guerrillas. With such a strong force concentrated, the arduousness of the project can be imagined.

The construction site was located in a small gully with no road between the mountains, and the cave could not accommodate many people. Therefore, despite the magnitude of the project, it could only be a small-scale operation. Even the only thirty-three people on the mountain chiseling team had to excavate simultaneously from the front and back of the mountain, divided into four groups working day and night shifts. In fact, working in the cave, there was no distinction between day and night, and they were always operating by the light of lamps. When drilling holes for explosives, one person held the drill and the other swung the hammer, sitting down to drill, looking up to drill, and drilling from under the crotch. A slight mistake would result in being hit by the hammer. Working in the dark cave for a long time gave people's eyesight special training. Ordinary people entering the cave with lanterns would shrink back and tiptoe, but they could still run while pulling carts.

The entire 200-meter-deep cave was all stone, and they relied entirely on drilling holes and using explosives to blast it piece by piece. Lighting the fuse and running out in the dark, the deeper the cave, the more difficult this step became. Later, they came up with a solution: they stationed a person every three to five zhang, each with a lantern. After the person inside lit the fuse, they would give a signal, and everyone would look at the light in front and run at the same time, which solved the problem. Every time after an explosion, the smoke would linger for a long time, choking people so that they could not enter the cave. To solve this problem, they asked two people to run back and forth to create an "artificial wind" to speed up the dissipation of the smoke. Every member of the mountain chiseling team proudly said: There are thousands of difficulties, but there are tens of thousands of solutions. Where there are difficulties, there are solutions.

Recently, the mountain chiseling team produced a detailed statistical table: in this project, they blasted more than 10,000 times, used more than 6,200 jin of explosives, spent more than 700 jin of lamp oil, excavated more than 3 million jin of stone, and used more than 10,030 sheets of hemp paper to make fuses. In addition, the steel drills used for drilling holes were worn down by more than 400 jin, and the original ten-jin iron hammers were left with no more than four or five jin. As for the number of steel drills broken and the number of times the tools were welded, there were even more. These figures are for the management area to account for, and it is said that the calculation was very troublesome. To be honest, this account cannot be calculated clearly. To statistically account for the 660 days and nights they fought in the half-li-long cave, how much effort they spent, how much sweat they shed, how much suffering they endured, and how much thought they devoted, even the most accurate computer would not be able to calculate it.

Cleverly Establishing the Feilong Ferry (Fēilóng Dù - Flying Dragon Ferry)

This is a very thought-provoking clever story. The Shijiazhuang Management Area of Shangyou Commune is located next to the Yunzhong River, but it does not see water all year round. Commune members reported: The river passes through the village, but the grain on both sides dies of drought. Is it a dry river? No, it is not. The upstream of the Yunzhong River has a lot of water, and the downstream has a lot of water, but there is no water only in the Shijiazhuang area. Where did the water go? In the early years, there was a superstitious saying that the "Dragon King" sucked the water away, so a water-suppressing temple was built here, but the water was still nowhere to be found. After communization, after investigation, the matter was clarified. It turned out that the terrain in this area was low, and floods had accumulated several zhang of cobblestone and sand layers, which over time became underground river channels. After figuring out the disease, it was time to prescribe the medicine. The management area began to manage it. Several connected reservoirs were built nearby, planning to receive a flow of water from the river sand. Building reservoirs on sandy land, taking soil from a distance to build help and pad the bottom, the project was very arduous, but it was quickly resolved. Only passing the water from the west bank of the river to the east bank, across the sandy riverbed that was more than sixty zhang wide, this problem was really not small. The story of cleverly crossing the Yunzhong River began here.

The road to success is often opened up from failures. Duan Jirong, the director of the management area, and the commune members went through many twists and turns to solve this problem. At first, everyone did not realize the arduousness of the work. The first proposal was to make a live wooden flume, making six wooden troughs eight feet long. An experiment showed that after the wood was wet, eight people could not lift one. At the same time, wooden flumes required a lot of wood and carpenters, and the investment was too large; in addition, they were inconvenient to move, and if they were washed away by floods, all previous efforts would be in vain. This method did not work. Some people proposed installing underground pipes to divert water, but the riverbed was not fixed, and it would be washed away by a flood, which also did not work. Left was no good, right was no good, and people felt a little tricky. Duan Jirong checked around the river beach all day long, sometimes squatting there for half a day. He studied with the commune members, and countless large and small meetings were held, but there was no clue. Some people began to waver, and even Duan Jirong, who was resourceful and knowledgeable, felt a little uncertain. But when he thought of the task assigned to him by the Party and the expectations of the masses, he immediately became strong. Once, during a casual conversation with the masses, someone suggested that they had seen tarpaulins at the train station covering things and not fearing rain. You said one thing, I said another, and they began to focus on the tarpaulin. Later, the opinions became more and more concrete, and finally, they proposed a plan to lay tarpaulin on the riverbed to divert water. Then, people were sent to Xinding City and Taiyuan City to buy tarpaulin. They sewed two pieces of tarpaulin together. In order to make the tarpaulin anti-corrosive, soft, and durable, they also bought more than 300 jin of rubber and coated the tarpaulin. They dug a shallow trench in the dry riverbed, laid the tarpaulin in the trench, and diverted water from the tarpaulin, which not only avoided seepage, but also made the water flow smoothly and unimpeded, with good results. In order to temporarily change the channel and make it easy to use, they tied iron rings to both sides of the tarpaulin and prepared many wooden rafters. When using it, they planted two rows of rafters and supported the tarpaulin, which naturally formed a crescent-shaped rainbow bridge. This rainbow bridge is very light. When used, six commune members can install it in ten minutes, and it takes less than five minutes to disassemble it. When the water flows, the cloth channel keeps wriggling, like a black dragon rising into the air and bowing its head to spit water. Therefore, the commune members gave it a name, called: Feilong Ferry.

    “争水”记
    ——忻定县上游公社水利工地的几个镜头
    本报记者　杨义
    新社会万象更新了。“争水”，这个提起来心上就不舒畅的字，如今也赋上了新的含义。它不再是旧社会里人与人之争，而是已经获得解放的人民征服自然，向天地争水，向山河争水。
    最近，记者在山西北部吕梁山麓访问了一个公社——上游公社，在这里处处可以看到公社化后的新型农民力改河山、滴水必争的革命干劲和英雄气魄。
    战胜泥砂
    从古老的忻定县城出发，往东地势越走越高，真是步步高升。一进入上游公社地境，马上出现了一个四面环山的小盆地，纵贯全境的云中河循势北流。这里从古就形成了一种不随人意的局面：高地盼水水不去，低处怕水水偏来。农民形容是：“高地扛红棍（祈雨），洼地好收成；低处发了愁，高地笑眉头。”世世代代的农民都盼望着治理云中河。人民公社遂了人们的千年心愿。
    为时不到一年，这里的群众斩断云中河，开了一道两丈宽、两丈到三丈多深，全长二十六里的人工运河。同时在低处修大坝筑大库，提高水位；在高地挖深渠，降低渠道，使许多从云中河渗透出来的小河小水，由向北流转向南流，由向低洼地流转向往高处流。沿运河还修建成金山、银山湖等五大蓄水、调水工程。连同其它工程，全公社已形成了河连渠、渠连湖、湖通库，排、蓄、浇相结合的水网。随着这些工程的诞生，各方面已结出了巨大的果实。沿人工运河两畔八百米远近的洼湿滩已经改变为良田，1959年平均亩产达二百九十斤粮食，受益的面积越来越扩大，共可扩大灌溉面积二十万亩。现在全部水湖水泊都已蓄上了水，水里有鱼，水面有船。运河正式放水以后，与纵横全县的忻定、卫星人造运河衔接起来，从公社所在地——奇村坐上船，不仅可以遍游全社，而且可以遍游全县。
    这项工程非常艰巨，是大跃进第一个大水利建设产物，因此被命名为跃进运河。除上游公社全力承担外，附近公社曾不断进行支援。历时一年有余，投用了八十多万个劳动工，挖取土石方达一百万方，河槽最深处在十一米左右。在建设过程中发起过好几次大战役，最艰巨最出名最有代表性的是最后一次，泥砂“堡垒”战。这次战役发生在秋天。河道开挖到奇村田场道附近，在三丈多深处突然碰上了流泥砂层。中间挖的越深，两旁拥出的泥砂越多。起初，集中大批人力突击挖，过一夜，就原封合龙了。后来，简直是随挖、随流。有一次许多社员正在河道下边掏泥砂，听着声音不对，急忙跑开，“轰！”的一声，就像崖塌似的，顿时就流出了半河槽的泥砂。有一个社员为了抢护工具，失足掉下去，费了很大周折才救出来。如何战胜四里多长的泥砂层？这是一场巨大的战斗。取泥砂，用铁锹铲，稀的铲不住，稠的也铲的很少。在河道两岸起土开沟，减轻压力，可以少流泥砂，但是工作量过大。后来，社员们一方面架高线吊运泥砂，一方面用筐子扛。在操作过程中，高空架上淋，肩上筐子漏，参加施工的人都糊成了泥人。为了提高运输泥砂的速度，上冻前，社员站在过膝的泥水里“手倒手”传送泥筐。就这样一处一处地分段治理，边挖砂，边在两旁打木钎、压柳条，堵塞流砂，一鼓气使二千多米长的流泥流砂初步得到控制。
    凿山引龙泉
    最近，上游公社传出了一个轰动全县的消息：三十三个社员，在山洞里干了二十二个月，凿通了一座二百五十米厚的大石山，把山后的河水引到了山前。
    这个不平凡的事迹发生在温村管理区的龙泉山，因此这个引水洞被命名为龙泉洞。这一带属吕梁山区，在抗日战争和解放战争年代，温村和孙村的民兵游击队，依靠这道山对敌斗争，人们看待它就像母亲一样地亲近。可是现在进行生产建设，它挡住几个流量的水，人们越来越意识到它是阻碍生产的征服对象了。1958年大跃进开始，温村农业社党支部经过多次勘察，选择了一处山薄的地方，提出了穿洞计划。当时有些人认为太困难，甚至把这项工程看成是赔钱圪塔。工程开始后，有的人看见进度慢，更加没有信心。但是党支部决心要打通这个洞。在党支部的大力支持下，施工人员百折不回地终于打通山梁引来了水。
    参加凿山的三十岁开外的社员，绝大部分是十多年前的民兵，有好些人是游击队员。凿山队队长就是温村游击队队长，管理区党支部书记是孙村的游击队队长。集中这样强的力量，其工程之艰巨就可想而知了。
    工地处在一道夹山无路的小沟里，洞内又容纳不下多少人，因此尽管工程浩大，也只能是小部队作战。就连仅有三十三个人的凿山队，也得从山前山后同时开挖，分开四组日夜轮班。其实在洞里工作哪还分个黑夜白天，无时无刻地都是仗着灯火操作。打炮眼时一人掌钎，一人扬锤，坐着打、仰天打、从胯下打，稍有失手就得挨锤。长期工作在漆黑的深洞里，使人们的眼力受到了特殊锻炼，平常人进洞打上灯笼缩手蹑足，但他们拉上车子却还要跑。
    整个二百多米的深洞全部是石头，全靠打眼下药一块一块地炸取。点着导火线，黑地里往外跑，洞越深这一关就越难过了。后来他们想出了一个办法：隔三丈五丈站一个人，每人提上灯笼，最里边的人点着导火线后，发个信号，所有的人瞅着前面的灯亮同时跑，才算解决了这个问题。每炸过一次之后，烟雾经久散不了，呛的人进不了洞。为了解决这个问题，他们叫两个人来回对跑，制造“人造风”，加速烟雾流散。凿山队每一个人都这样自豪地说：困难千千万，办法万万千，有困难就有办法。
    最近，凿山队制出了一张详细的统计表：在这项工程中他们共炸了一万多炮，使用炸药六千二百多斤，费去点灯用油七百多斤，共挖取石方三百多万斤，制导火线就使用了一万零三刀大麻纸。另外，打眼使用的钢钎，磨掉了四百多斤，原来十斤重的铁锤留下也不过四、五斤了。至于打断钢钎的条数、接焊工具的次数那就更多了。这些数字是准备管理区下账用的，听说计算时很费周折。说真的，这笔账是算不清的。要统计他们在长达半里的山洞里战斗六百六十个日日夜夜，费了多少劲，出了多少汗，吃了多少苦，花了多少心血，就是拿来最精确的计算机，也是无从算清的。
    巧设飞龙渡
    这是一个非常耐人寻思的巧故事。上游公社石家庄管理区傍着云中河，却常年见不到水。社员们反映：河流穿村过，旱死两岸谷。是道干河吗？不是的。云中河上游水很大，下游水很大，唯有到石家庄这一带就没水。水哪里去了，早年有种迷信的说法，认为“龙王”把水吸走了，因而在这里修了座镇水庙，可是水还是渺茫无踪。公社化以后经过勘察，事情弄明白了。原来这一带地势较低，洪水泛滥冲积了好几丈厚的卵石、沙层，年长日久变成了地下河道。摸清了病好下药，管理区开始治理它。附近修了若干连环蓄水库，计划从河沙里接过一个流量的水来。在沙性地上筑水库，从远处取土修帮垫底，工程非常艰巨，但都迅速解决了。唯有把水从河西渡过河东，经过宽达六十多丈的砂河床，这个难题可真不小。巧渡云中河的故事就从这里开始。
    成功之路往往是从失败中开辟出来的。管理区主任段吉荣和社员们解决这个问题费了许许多多周折。开始时大家并没有意识到工作的艰巨性。最初提出作活木渡槽，作出八尺长的六个木槽，一试验：水湿以后八个人抬不动一个。同时，木渡槽需用木材、木工很多，投资太大；另外搬动不便，被洪水冲走就会前功尽弃。这个办法行不通。有人提出安暗管引水，可是河床不固定，一发洪水就会冲走，也行不通。左不行，右不行，人们才感到有些棘手了。段吉荣整日绕着河滩查看，有时蹲在那里一蹲就是半天。和社员共同钻研，大会小会开了不计其数，一直没有个头绪。有的人开始动摇了，就连智多谋广的段吉荣也有些底虚了。可是他想到党交给他的任务和群众的期待，马上就坚强起来。有一次和群众闲谈中有人提出，看见火车站帆布遮东西不怕雨。你一言，我一语，开始在帆布上打主意。后来意见越酝酿越具体，最后提出了在河床上铺帆布引水的方案。接着派人到忻定城、太原市买回帆布来。他们把帆布两幅并一幅地缝在一起。为了使帆布防腐、柔软、经久耐用，又买了三百多斤橡胶，涂刷了帆布。在干河床上挖了一道浅壕，把帆布铺在壕里，从帆布上引水，不但避免了渗透，而且水流畅通无阻，效果良好。为了临时改变渠道、使用方便起见，他们在帆布两边拴上铁环，准备了许多木椽，用的时候，栽埋两排椽子，把帆布支起来，自然就形成了一道月牙形虹桥。这座虹桥非常轻便，用的时候，六个社员十分钟就能安装起来，拆卸连五分钟也用不了。流水的时候布渠不断蠕动，活像一条黑龙腾空而起，俯首吐水。因此，社员们给它起了个名字，就叫：飞龙渡。
