Xinhua News Agency, January 21st, Washington Dispatch: The White House issued a statement yesterday announcing that U.S. President Eisenhower, at the invitation of Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, will visit Japan around June 20th of this year.

Eisenhower's visit to Japan shortly after the signing of the new aggressive military alliance treaty between the U.S. and Japan is seen as shoring up Nobusuke Kishi, who has become the target of public criticism within Japan, and strengthening the Japan-U.S. military alliance relationship already established by this treaty. The Associated Press, in reporting the news of Eisenhower's upcoming visit to Japan, said that Eisenhower's trip to Japan will "greatly help strengthen the new partnership between Japan and the United States established by the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security." It also said, "There are indications that Nobusuke Kishi may face a difficult moment due to calls from political opponents within the Liberal Democratic Party for his resignation. Some observers believe that when the political situation in Japan is heating up in June, Eisenhower's visit to Tokyo will help strengthen Kishi Nobusuke's prestige." This will be a "powerful support" for Kishi Nobusuke.

The news agency also revealed that another purpose of Eisenhower's visit to Japan is to try to obstruct Japan from improving relations with China. It said, "The President's visit will help suppress the growing pressure in Japan to change its attitude toward Communist China."

The White House also expressed in the same statement its hope that the Crown Prince of Japan will visit the United States in May of this year.

    为岸信介撑腰　为日美军事同盟打气
    艾森豪威尔将于六月访问日本
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：白宫昨天发表声明宣布，美国总统艾森豪威尔应日本首相岸信介的邀请，将在今年6月20日前后到日本访问。
    艾森豪威尔在日美两国政府签订新的侵略性军事同盟条约后不久的日本之行，被认为是给在日本国内成为众矢之的的岸信介撑腰和加强已经由这项条约确定下来的日美军事同盟关系。美联社在报道艾森豪威尔将要访问日本的消息时说，艾森豪威尔的日本之行，将“非常有助于加强日本和美国之间由共同合作和安全条约确定下来的新的伙伴关系”。它还说，“有迹象表明，岸信介可能由于自由民主党的政敌要他下台而面临一个困难时刻。某些观察家认为，当6月间日本的政局正闹得发热的时候，艾森豪威尔到东京的访问将有助于加强岸信介的声望。”这将是对岸信介的“强有力的支持”。
    这家通讯社还透露，艾森豪威尔访问日本的另一个目的是企图阻挠日本同中国改善关系。它说，“总统的访问有助于压制日本的日益增加的要求改变对共产党中国的态度的压力”。
    白宫在同一个声明中还表示希望日本皇太子在今年5月访问美国。
