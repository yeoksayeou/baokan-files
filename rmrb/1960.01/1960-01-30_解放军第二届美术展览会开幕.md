Xinhua News Agency, January 28th: The Second Art Exhibition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army opened today at the Hall of Literary Brilliance in the Palace Museum. This is another large-scale military art exhibition following the art exhibition held in 1957 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the army's founding.

This exhibition features over 640 art pieces selected from more than 4,500 works from across the military. The vast majority of these traditional Chinese paintings, oil paintings, prints, New Year pictures, and paper-cuttings vividly reflect the rich struggles and lives of the People's Army as the defender and builder of the socialist cause. The works have clear ideas, broad themes, rich content, and diverse forms, possessing a strong fighting spirit and distinctive national style. For example, the traditional Chinese paintings "Sending Children to Surrender" and "Feeding Pigs" by painter Huang Zhou, "Long Live the Great Leap Forward" and "Red Female Telegraph Operator" by Lieutenant Assistant Liu Wei, "Long Rainbow Beyond the Great Wall" by cultural troupe member Zhang Youpei, the oil painting "First Shot" by Liu Qing, and "Bombarding Jinmen" by Han Ke and Peng Bin have all received praise from the art world and audiences. The exhibition also showcases a number of representative stage art and film art designs, cover designs for newspapers and books, mastheads, decorative patterns, illustrations, and other practical art works.

Among the works exhibited this time, many are by amateur artists who are familiar with the subjects they portray and have considerable expressive power. The long scroll traditional Chinese painting "Reluctant Farewell" by film projectionist Guo Ximin vividly depicts the scene of the Volunteer Army bidding farewell to the Korean people upon their return home. The brushwork is meticulous, and the colors are bright, giving people a sense of being there.

    解放军第二届美术展览会开幕
    新华社28日讯　中国人民解放军第二届美术作品展览会今天在故宫博物院文华殿开幕。这是继1957年为纪念建军三十周年举行的美术展览之后，又一次规模盛大的部队美术展览会。
    这次共展出从全军四千五百余件作品中精选出来的美术作品六百四十余件，绝大部分国画、油画、版画、年画和剪纸，都生动地反映了人民军队作为社会主义事业的保卫者和建设者的丰富斗争和生活。作品思想鲜明、题材广泛、内容丰富、形式多样。具有强烈的战斗性和鲜明的民族风格。如画家黄胄的国画“送子投诚”、“喂猪”，中尉助理员刘蔚的“大跃进万岁”、“红色女报务员”，文工团员张幼培的“塞外长虹”，柳青的油画“第一次射击”，韩柯、彭彬的“炮击金门”等都受到美术界和观众的好评。展览会还展出了若干有代表性的舞台美术和电影美术设计，报刊书籍的封面设计、题头、花饰、插图等实用美术作品。
    在这次展出的作品中，很多都是业余作者，他们对表现的题材熟悉，表现力也相当丰富。电影放映员郭西民的长卷国画“惜别图”，生动地画出了志愿军归国时和朝鲜人民依依惜别的场面，笔法工整，色调鲜明，使人看了有身临其境之感。
