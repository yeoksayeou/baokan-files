Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 9th -- The construction ceremony for the Aswan High Dam project in the United Arab Republic, assisted by the Soviet Union, was held today.

President Nasser laid the foundation stone for the dam today and pressed a button, causing an explosion on the east bank of the Nile River where the spillway will be excavated, marking the start of the project.

At the opening ceremony held at the dam site seven kilometers south of Aswan City, Musa Arafa, Minister of Public Works for the Egyptian Region of the United Arab Republic and Chairman of the High Dam Construction Committee, and Soviet Minister of Power Station Construction Novikov delivered speeches successively. Then, President Nasser spoke.

Xinhua News Agency, Aswan, 9th -- Professor Komzin, the chief Soviet expert in charge of the first phase of the Aswan High Dam construction project, told Xinhua reporters today in Aswan, this beautiful town in Upper Egypt, how Soviet experts, through their bold initiatives and hard work, turned a project that once seemed impossible, designed by Western companies, into reality.

Professor Komzin said that the original design of the High Dam proposed by the British architectural firm Gibb & Partners, and endorsed by Western experts, was impractical and extremely expensive. According to this design, seven tunnels had to be excavated in the granite on the banks of the Nile; for the dam itself, a seven-meter filter pool had to be built at a depth of thirty-four meters. As for the gates used to regulate the water, Gibb & Partners' design did not offer any specific suggestions. In addition, careful study revealed that although the High Dam plan stipulated that the hydroelectric power station should generate 354,000 kilowatts, in fact, according to the Western design, the power generation of the hydroelectric power station would not exceed 100,000 kilowatts because the water pressure in the tunnels was not strong enough.

Soviet experts conducted extensive research on various dams designed by British and French companies in Africa. Take the Aswan Low Dam designed by a British company as an example. This dam had to be expanded three times in thirty-six years, so the British company could obtain more profits. Strangely, the engineering plan did not originally design a hydroelectric power station. After studying the Owen Falls Dam in Uganda, it was proven that this dam could have been twice as large as its current capacity.

Professor Komzin said that all of this clearly shows that imperialism is always imperialism. It provides "aid" to underdeveloped countries only to ensure that they get more profits for themselves.

When talking about the revised High Dam design by Soviet experts, Professor Komzin listed the following advantages: First, the dam body utilizes local materials, using the large amounts of granite and yellow sand on both sides of the Nile; second, excavating an open-air water diversion channel instead of seven tunnels will reduce the total cost by 15%, or 12 million Egyptian pounds; third, because an open-air canal is excavated, the originally designed generating capacity of 354,000 kilowatts can be guaranteed, which would be impossible according to the Western design.

Professor Komzin further said, "The Soviet Union not only provided the best solution to the technical problems for the construction of this huge project in Africa, but also sent first-class equipment, machinery, experts, knowledge, and the most important thing – our friendship."

### 在苏联的帮助下  阿联阿斯旺水坝工程开工  苏联的设计水平远远超过西方国家

    在苏联的帮助下
    阿联阿斯旺水坝工程开工
    苏联的设计水平远远超过西方国家
    据新华社开罗9日电　由苏联帮助阿联建设的阿斯旺高水坝建筑工程今天举行了开工典礼。
    纳赛尔总统今天为水坝奠了基，并且按动电钮，使尼罗河东岸将开凿溢洪道的地方爆炸，工程于是开始。
    在阿斯旺市以南七公里的水坝工地举行的开工仪式上，阿联埃及地区公共工程部长兼高水坝建设委员会主席穆萨·阿拉法、苏联电站建造部长诺维科夫相继致词。然后，纳赛尔总统讲了话。
    新华社阿斯旺9日电　负责阿斯旺高水坝第一期建设工程的苏联首席专家科姆津教授今天在阿斯旺这个上埃及的美丽市镇中向新华社记者谈到苏联专家如何通过自己大胆的创议和辛勤的工作把西方公司设计的一度看来不可能进行的工程变为现实。
    科姆津教授说，原先由英国建筑公司吉布合伙工程公司提出、并且得到西方专家赞同的高水坝设计是不实用的，而且费用浩大。根据这个设计，必须在尼罗河岸的花岗岩上挖凿七条隧道；为了水坝本身，还必须在三十四米深的地方建造七米的滤池。至于用来调节水的闸门，吉布合伙工程公司的设计根本没有提出任何具体的建议。此外，仔细研究后就可以看出，虽然高水坝计划规定，水电站应发电三十五万四千瓩。事实上，根据西方的设计，水电站的发电量不超过十万瓩，因为隧道的水压不够强。
    苏联专家对英国和法国在非洲设计的各个水坝进行了广泛的研究。就拿一家英国公司设计的阿斯旺低水坝来说，这个水坝在三十六年里不得不进行三次扩建，因此，英国公司可以获得更多的利润。奇怪的是，工程计划原先没有设计水电站。研究了乌干达的奥温水坝之后证明，这个水坝本来可以比现有能力大两倍。
    科姆津教授说，这一切清楚地表明，帝国主义总是帝国主义，它向不发达国家提供“援助”，只是为了保证它们自己得到更多的利润。
    在谈到苏联专家修改后的高水坝设计时，科姆津教授列举了如下的优点：第一、坝身就地取材，利用尼罗河两岸的大量的花岗岩和黄沙；第二、挖掘一条露天的引水渠道来代替七条隧道，将使全部费用降低15％，即一千二百万埃镑；第三、由于挖了一条露天运河，就可以保证原先设计的三十五万四千瓩发电能力，而根据西方的设计，这是不可能达到的。
    科姆津教授进一步说，“苏联不但为非洲建设这个巨大的工程提出了解决技术问题的最好办法，还送来了头等的装备、机器、专家、知识和最重的东西——我们的友谊。”
