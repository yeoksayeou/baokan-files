Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 29th: Sichuan Province plans to greatly increase the sown area of early spring crops this year, the sowing period will be advanced, and agricultural technical requirements will be even stricter. All parts of the province are making early preparation for plowing an important part of striving for a continued leap forward in agricultural production this year. All special districts and counties have held four-level cadre meetings at all levels to further summarize the experience of last year's bumper harvest, formulate leap forward plans, and actively take measures to prepare for spring plowing.

All parts of the province have organized inspection teams to inspect farmland capital construction work such as water conservancy construction, soil and water conservation, and soil improvement, vigorously promote advanced tools and improve labor organization, and strive for the timely completion of water conservancy projects, advance water storage, and ensure water for spring rice transplanting. In the half month before the Spring Festival, more than 100,000 water conservancy projects have been completed in the province, increasing the irrigated area by more than 5 million mu, more than double the number completed last month.

While vigorously developing pig raising and fertilizer accumulation and doing a good job in the field management of green manure crops, a vigorous mass movement to accumulate and create fertilizer has been launched everywhere to prepare sufficient fertilizer for large spring crops. The broad masses collect from mountains, scoop from water, sweep from underground, and compost on the edge of fields, using every possible means, accumulating, creating, and applying fertilizer at the same time. More than 1.7 billion dan of fertilizer have been accumulated before the Spring Festival.

The mass movement to add and rush-manufacture small farm tools has also entered a new peak. Guangyuan County's communes organized 80,000 people to adopt methods such as modification, replenishment, and repair to use local materials and cooperate in processing. In the four days of the Spring Festival rush, more than 1.5 million farm tools were produced. New-style plows, seeders, various seedling raising devices and other agricultural machinery and improved farm tools are also being produced in large quantities.

Advanced technology transfer activities have also been widely carried out. All localities widely exchange experiences and train farmer technicians by holding on-site meetings, running training courses, and holding technical night schools.

All localities have comprehensively arranged the work of various departments with agricultural production as the center. Industrial departments actively provide native steel and native iron, rush to manufacture various agricultural machinery, and carry out the installation of irrigation and drainage machinery and the production of accessories. Commercial department employees have launched a heated competition in supplying spring plowing production materials, not only actively purchasing, supplying, and processing production tools, but also carrying out activities to impart the technology of using agricultural machinery. The transportation department also gives priority to the transportation of agricultural machinery and spring plowing materials.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, January 29th: Seize the time to prepare for plowing and strive to achieve a good start in spring plowing production. This is the battle call of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee to the league and municipal committees.

The current situation in rural and pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia is very good. As of mid-January, the region had completed 53 small reservoirs, 232 ponds and dams, more than 3,000 large and small canals, and 1,851 various bridges, culverts, and gate buildings. At the same time, 2,351 wells were drilled in agricultural areas and 3,853 wells were drilled in pastoral areas, and more than 6,500 renovation projects were completed. A total of 1,022,200 mu of irrigated area can be expanded, accounting for 22.5% of the annual plan to expand the irrigated area. The region has accumulated 230 billion jin of various fertilizers, accounting for 64.8% of the annual amount of fertilizer accumulated. At present, more than 40,000 carts are continuously transporting fertilizer to the fields, and the fertilizer delivered to the fields accounts for 22.5% of the total fertilizer accumulated.

In order to ensure a good start in spring plowing production, the Autonomous Region Party Committee recently requested that the people of all localities continue to engage in large-scale water conservancy and complete 70% of the annual water conservancy project earthwork task before spring plowing; combine the winter hygiene movement to continue to carry out fertilizer accumulation and delivery activities, use local conditions to carry out ice road fertilizer delivery, and strive to deliver most of the fertilizer accumulated now to the ground before the land thaws. All localities should also seize the manufacture of soil fertilizers; do a good job in rolling land, preserving moisture, inspecting seeds, reforming tools, repairing and matching agricultural tools; strengthen livestock feeding management and the protection of pregnant and young animals, and promote the further development of "one hundred piglets per hundred mu" and hog production. In addition, the Autonomous Region Party Committee also requires all localities to promote current production with ideological education as the guiding principle; arrange the lives of commune members well so that commune members can spend the Spring Festival well.

This newspaper reported that the Yangzhou Prefectural Committee organized a thousand-person inspection team to go deep into the cities, counties and commune factories to inspect the production of spring plowing and spring planting production materials.

The production of agricultural production materials for spring plowing and spring planting in Yangzhou Prefecture has achieved great overall results. For example, more than 1,000 water scoopers have been repaired, accounting for 70% of the number to be repaired. The storage of water scooper accessories is sufficient for the repair and matching of water scoopers in the entire district, and the number of newly manufactured and repaired cultivation, harrowing, threshing tools, new-style windmills, and powder sprayers is more than 47,000, which is also a considerable amount. However, in general, the progress is still not fast, and the progress in various places is not balanced. The prefectural committee has comprehensively deployed the production tasks of agricultural production materials before April this year, and immediately organized a district-wide general inspection, requiring that through this inspection, the vast number of employees be mobilized, repair (reason), manufacture (create), reform (tool reform), and test (trial production of new tools) be carried out simultaneously to launch a climax of large-scale production of spring plowing and spring planting production materials.

The prefectural committee and the industrial departments of various cities and counties transferred more than 100 cadres to form an inspection team, with a total of about 1,000 people in the district. They were led by the leading comrades of the industrial departments of each city and county to lead the inspection of factories. The content of the inspection mainly includes checking whether the idea of industrial support for agriculture is consolidated; checking the implementation of the plan and the variety, quantity and quality of products. In order to better understand the needs of the countryside, the inspection teams also sent some people to go deep into the production teams of the commune to conduct investigation and research work to find out what is needed in those places and when, so as to arrange production. As of the 19th, the inspectors of the cities and counties had arrived at the grassroots level and started activities. Wherever the inspection team went, they talked about the current situation, the alliance between workers and peasants, commended the advanced, and established benchmarks. The employees and masses quickly launched a competition to see who could serve agriculture better, and accelerated the progress of repairing, manufacturing, reforming, and testing spring plowing farm tools. Some cadres of the Taizhou Jiangyan Farm Tool Factory were originally afraid of trouble in engaging in small farm tools, afraid of losing money in engaging in improved farm tools, and were not active in serving agricultural production. This inspection mobilized the masses to seriously criticize these wrong ideas, changed their attitudes, and successfully trial-produced eight new-style farm tools such as animal-powered harvesters and mud mashers in just a few days. The inspection team of Gaoyou County inspected the farm tool factory of the Sanduo Commune and found that the rapid soil cultivator jointly created by the factory and a party branch secretary of the Mao Wu Brigade was very simple, and the work efficiency was five times higher than that of manual soil cultivation. It immediately convened an on-site meeting of seven communes to promote it.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, January 29th: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, located in the subtropical region of southern China, has launched intense preparations for plowing production. People's communes everywhere are striving to take the initiative to make preparation for plowing work ahead of the season.

Before the Spring Festival, the 20 million mu of land in the autonomous region that should be winter-turned has been completely turned. Yulin, Nanning, Liuzhou and other three special districts have irrigated, harrowed and leveled more than 1 million mu of rice fields on the land that has been winter-turned, and sown more than 5.2 million jin of upland rice seeds. All localities have adopted the method of accumulating fertilizer while delivering fertilizer, so that many rice fields and corn fields have been fertilized with 50 to 160 dan of base fertilizer per mu. All localities have properly arranged the fine varieties of rice, corn, peanuts and cassava needed for spring sowing. More than 200 million jin of seeds have been transferred between counties or communes in the region and imported from other places.

In order to promote the in-depth development of preparation for plowing production, all localities have organized production inspection teams, led by party committee secretaries at all levels, to inspect and solve problems while inspecting. Through inspection and evaluation, typical experiences were discovered and promoted in a timely manner. More than 19,000 county, commune, and production team cadres in Yulin County carried bedding, farm tools, and telephones to set up camp in the fields and eat, live, and work with the commune members. Red flags fluttered everywhere in the fields, and people's voices boiled. Before the Spring Festival, the county's 20 communes had irrigated and harrowed 122,000 mu of land and sown more than 2.04 million jin of early rice seeds.

This year, spring plowing tools in various parts of the autonomous region have also been prepared earlier and better. The farm tool manufacturing and repair factories of the special districts, counties, and communes are rushing to manufacture various carts, new-style farm tools, and rice transplanters day and night. Liuzhou, Baise, Yulin and other regions have also held on-site meetings for the appraisal and promotion of rice transplanters and training meetings for rice transplanter operators. Qintang Commune in Guixian County fixed more than 1,400 people to specialize in repairing and manufacturing carts and farm tools. After three days of rush work, a total of more than 4,800 plows, harrows, carts, rice transplanters, etc. were repaired (pieces). More than 5,300 pairs of mud baskets were woven. (Attached picture)

    大地回春备耕忙
    四川各地提前春耕准备　内蒙古水利积肥成绩好  扬州专区大抓修造农具　广西僮族自治区忙备耕
    新华社成都29日电　四川省今年早春作物计划播种面积大大增加，播种期将要提前，农业技术要求也更加严格。全省各地都把提早备耕作为争取今年农业生产继续跃进的重要一环。各专区、县都已层层召开四级干部会议，进一步总结去年大丰收的经验，制订跃进规划，积极采取措施做好春耕准备。
    全省各地纷纷组织检查团，检查水利施工、水土保持和改良土壤等农田基本建设工作，大力推广先进工具和改善劳动组织，力争水利工程按时完工，提前蓄水，保证春季插秧用水。在春节前的半个月中，全省完工的水利工程已有十万多处，增加灌溉面积超过五百万多亩，比上月完工数增加一倍多。
    在大力发展养猪积肥、做好绿肥作物田间管理的同时，各地普遍掀起轰轰烈烈的突击积肥造肥热潮，为大春作物准备充足的肥料。广大群众山上采、水里捞、地下扫、田边沤、千方百计，边积边造边施，到春节前已积肥十七亿多担。
    添补赶造小农具的群众运动也进入新的高峰。广元县各公社组织了八万人，采取改制、添补、修理等办法就地取材、协作加工，春节前突击四天就造出一百五十多万件农具。新式犁、播种机、各种育苗器等农业机具和改良农具也在大量生产。
    先进技术的传授活动也已广泛展开。各地通过召开现场会，开办训练班、举办技术夜校等方式广泛交流经验和培训农民技术员。
    各地都以农业生产为中心，全面地安排了各部门的工作。工业部门积极提供土钢、土铁，赶造各种农业机具，并且进行排灌机具的安装和配件生产。商业部门职工在供应春耕生产资料工作中掀起了热火朝天的竞赛，不仅积极采购、供应和加工生产工具，并且开展了传授使用农业机具技术的运动。交通部门对农业机具、春耕物资也优先运输。
    新华社呼和浩特29日电　抓紧备耕，力争实现春耕生产开门红，这是中共内蒙古自治区党委向各盟、市委提出的战斗号召。
    内蒙古当前农村、牧区形势很好。截至1月中旬，全区已完成小型水库五十三座，塘坝二百三十二座，大小渠道三千多条和各种桥梁、涵洞、闸门等建筑物一千八百五十一座。同时，在农业区打井二千三百五十一眼，牧区打井三千八百五十三眼，并完成六千五百多处整修工程。共可扩大灌溉面积一百零二万二千亩，占全年扩大灌溉面积计划的22．5％。全区已积各种肥料二千三百亿斤，占全年积肥数量的64．8％。目前，各地有四万多辆大车络绎不绝地向田间送肥，已送到田边的肥料占已积肥总数的22．5％。
    为了确保春耕生产开门红，自治区党委最近要求各地人民继续大搞水利，在春耕前完成全年水利工程土石方任务的70％；结合冬季卫生运动继续开展积肥、送肥运动，利用当地条件，开展冰道送肥，力争在土地解冻前，把现在积下的肥料大部分送到地里，各地还要大抓土化肥制造；做好磙地、保墒、检查种子、改革工具、修配农具等工作；加强牲畜饲养管理和孕畜、幼畜的保育工作，推动“百亩百仔”和生猪生产进一步发展。此外，自治区党委还要求各地以思想教育为纲，推动当前生产；安排好社员生活，使社员过好春节。
    本报讯　扬州地委组织千人检查团分头深入各市、县和公社工厂，检查春耕春种生产资料的生产工作。
    扬州专区春耕春种农业生产资料的生产情况，总的成绩很大，如戽水机已修好一千多台，占需修数的70％，戽水机配件储备量已足够全区戽水机修配之用，新制和整修的耕、耙、脱粒工具、新式风车、喷粉器等四万七千余件，数量也不少。但一般来说进度还不快，各地进度也不平衡。地委全面部署了今年4月份以前的农业生产资料生产任务，并立即组织全区性的大检查，要求通过这个检查发动广大职工，修（理）、制（造）、改（工具改革）、试（新工具的试制）同时并进，掀起一个大搞春耕春种生产资料的高潮。
    地委和各市、县的工业部门抽调了一百余名干部组成检查团，全区共一千人左右，分别由各该市县的工业部门的领导同志挂帅，率领下厂检查。检查的内容主要是查工业支援农业的思想是否巩固；查计划执行情况和产品的品种、数量和质量。为更好地摸清农村的需要，各检查团还分出一部分人员深入到公社生产队去进行调查研究工作，摸清那些地方需要什么，什么时候要，以便安排生产。到19日为止，各市、县的检查团人员已分别到达基层，展开活动。检查团所到之处，讲当前形势，工农联盟，表扬先进、树立标兵，职工群众很快就掀起了比谁为农业服务得好的竞赛运动，加快了春耕农具修、制、改、试的进度。泰州姜堰农具厂某些干部原来搞小农具怕麻烦，搞改良农具怕蚀本，为农业生产服务不积极，这次检查中发动群众严肃批判了这些错误思想，转变了态度，短短几天内已试制成功畜力收割机、?泥机等八种新式农具。高邮县检查团在三垛公社农具厂检查，发现该厂和毛吴大队一位党支部书记合作创制的快速理墒器很简便，工效比人工理墒高五倍，立即召开了七个公社的现场会议加以推广。
    新华社南宁29日电　地处祖国南方亚热带的广西僮族自治区，展开紧张的备耕生产。各地人民公社处处争取主动，使备耕工作赶在季节前面。
    到春节前，自治区应冬翻的两千万亩土地，已经全部翻完。玉林、南宁、柳州等三个专区，已在经过冬翻的土地上灌水耙田和平整秧田一百万多亩，播下旱稻种子五百二十多万斤。各地采取了边积肥边送肥的办法，使许多稻田和玉米地每亩已施下基肥五十担到一百六十担。春播所需的水稻、玉米、花生和木薯的良种，各地都已妥善安排，全区各县之间或公社之间相互调剂和从外地调进的种子已有两亿多斤。
    为了推动备耕生产深入发展，各地组织了生产检查团，由各级党委书记带队，边检查边解决问题，通过检查评比，发现典型经验及时推广。玉林县一万九千多名县、公社、生产队干部，携带铺盖、农具和电话机到田头扎寨，和社员们同吃、同住、同劳动，田野上到处红旗招展，人声沸腾。到春节前，全县二十个公社已灌水耙田十二万二千多亩，播下了早稻种子二百零四万多斤。
    今年自治区各地春耕工具也准备得又早又好。各专区、县、公社的农具制造厂和修配厂都在日夜赶制各种车子、新式农具和插秧机。柳州、百色、玉林等地区还召开插秧机鉴定推广现场会和插秧机手训练会议。贵县覃塘公社固定一千四百多人专门修造车子、农具，经过三天突击，共修理好犁、耙、车子、插秧机等四千八百多架（件）。编织泥箕五千三百多对。（附图片）
