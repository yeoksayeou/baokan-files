    Always Listen to the Party
    Liu Qing
    I. Listen to the Party and continuously reform one's thinking;
    II. Be with the people, and actively participate in practical struggles and practical work;
    III. In art, strive to develop one's own originality and unique style.
    As a literary creator, I study Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, mainly paying attention to these three points, and constantly making such efforts.
    To write some irresponsible works that promote self-expression or flaunt literary skills, this is of course purely a personal "achievement." But to write some works that are truly beneficial to the Party and the people, beneficial to eliminating bourgeois political and ideological influence, and help the people establish communist ideology and moral character, who can do it without honestly following Mao Zedong's literary and artistic direction?
    Precisely because machines cannot write novels, poems, and plays, precisely because the literary creation process, past, present, and future, always contains factors of individual hardship and individual talent, the most important thing for communist writers is: never forget to distinguish themselves from bourgeois writers for the rest of their lives. This mainly refers to the relationship with the Party and the relationship with the people. That is to say: never separate from the leadership of the Party and the working people for the rest of their lives. Non-proletarian literature has thousands of years of history, while proletarian literature has only a few decades. This situation intensifies our sense of political and career responsibility. In both our writing attitude and our life attitude, we must adhere to and develop the tradition that began with Gorky and Lu Xun—hatred for the enemy, love for the people, and lifelong hard work.
    When a writer displays the souls of various characters, he also displays his own soul. This is inevitable, undeniable, and not to be boasted about. The writer's worldview, his attitude towards life, his writing attitude, temperament, and character, can all be found expressed in his works. Who can still be deceived by the "good intentions" theory now? Even whether one strives to write for the people or for oneself is answered in the works! Before a writer creates characters, he has already begun to create his own image. Why does Chairman Mao repeatedly urge us to go to the masses and to the fiery struggles? This is the reason.
    But don't think that going to life will naturally solve all the problems faced by a modern Chinese writer. No, far from it! We must also strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, especially Mao Zedong Thought, including all of Comrade Mao Zedong's works. A writer faces Chinese society, the Chinese revolution, and the great mass movements in China to exercise his literary skills. If he does not study Chairman Mao's works well, he should not think about writing accurately and profoundly. If we strive to go upstream, we should strive from here.

### 永远听党的话

    永远听党的话
    柳青
    一、听党的话，不断地改造思想；
    二、同人民在一起，积极地参加实际斗争和实际工作；
    三、在艺术上，努力地发挥自己的独创性和独特风格。
    作为一个文学创作工作者，我学习毛主席的文艺思想，主要地注意这三点，不断地作着这样的努力。
    写出一些不负责任的、宣扬自我或者卖弄文学技巧的作品，这当然纯粹是个人的“成就”了。但要写出一些作品，确实有利于党和人民，有利于消除资产阶级政治影响和思想影响，帮助人民建立共产主义思想和道德品质，不老老实实遵循毛泽东文艺方针，谁能办到呢？
    正因为机器不能写小说、诗和剧本，正因为文学创作过程，过去、现在和将来，永远包含着个人艰辛和个人才能的因素，所以共产主义作家最重要的事情是：一辈子也不要忘记把自己和资产阶级作家区别开来。这主要地指同党的关系和同人民的关系。就是说：一辈子也不要脱离党的领导和劳动人民。非无产阶级文学有几千年的历史了，无产阶级文学才有几十年的历史。这个情况，加重了我们政治的和事业的责任感。我们在写作态度和生活态度这两方面，要坚持和发展从高尔基和鲁迅开始的传统——对敌人仇恨、对人民热爱和毕生的刻苦精神。
    作家在展示各种人物的灵魂时，同时展示了自己的灵魂。这是不可避免的，不可掩饰的，也是不容吹嘘的。作家的世界观，他的生活态度、写作态度、气质和性格，都在他的作品里找得到表现。“动机好的”论，现在还能骗几个人呢？甚至于努力写作，到底是为人民还是为自己，也在作品里头有回答！作家在创造人物以前，早已开始创造自己的形象了。毛主席为什么谆谆告诫我们到群众中去、到火热的斗争中去呢？就是这个原因。
    但是不要以为到生活中去，就自然而然地解决了一个现代中国作家所面临的一切问题了。不，远远不是这样！还要努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，特别是毛泽东思想，包括毛泽东同志的一切著作。一个作家面对着中国社会、中国革命和中国的伟大群众运动，来施展他的文学技巧本领，如果不好好学习毛主席的著作，就不要想写得准确和深刻。我们力争上游，就应该从这里争起。
