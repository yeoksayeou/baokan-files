    Strengthening Industrial Support for Pig Raising
    On January 11, the Nanjing Xinhua Daily published an editorial entitled "Strengthening Industrial Support for Pig Raising." The following is an abstract:
    Supporting the great development of pig raising is an important part of the current industrial support for agriculture. The rapid development of pig raising will inevitably bring a series of new problems in terms of material and technical conditions and labor. Pigs eat a lot, and to raise pigs on a large scale, we must vigorously open up feed sources and expand feed processing. Pig raising requires a lot of labor. Whether it is feed processing, delivery, water use, or fertilizer transportation, it requires a lot of labor. The more pigs raised, the more labor is needed, and the contradiction between large-scale pig raising and labor shortage will become increasingly acute. With the expansion of collective breeding, work such as epidemic prevention and isolation is more urgent than in the past when pigs were raised privately or on a small scale publicly. At the same time, the demand for medicines and equipment will also increase. To raise pigs on a large scale, it is also necessary to carry out basic construction such as pig houses and pig pens on a large scale, and the demand for building materials such as bricks, tiles, bamboo, and wood will surge. Of course, many of the above-mentioned new problems can and should be solved locally by the people's communes themselves. However, in many aspects, support from industrial and handicraft departments is still needed, especially in the initial stage of large-scale pig raising. Therefore, all industrial and handicraft departments should act quickly and contribute to the development of pig raising.
    Strengthening feed processing is an important aspect of supporting the great development of pig raising. Where does the feed come from? Of course, the first thing is for the people's communes to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and do everything possible to plant, collect, and store all available feed; however, in cities and many factories and enterprises, there are also many feed resources that need to be widely exploited and fully utilized. In addition to the rice husks and wheat bran from grain processing plants and the soybean cake and peanut cake from oil mills, the distiller's grains from wineries, the sugar dregs, waste silk, and green heads from sugar factories, the eggshells and bones from canning factories, and other related factory scraps can all be used as relatively good feed after processing and comprehensive utilization. Grain processing departments should also make full use of processing equipment to process feed for the communes in conjunction with their business.
    In the work of supporting pig raising, we must also focus on the reform of pig raising tools. Vigorously carrying out the reform of pig raising tools can greatly reduce labor intensity, allowing a few people to raise a large number of pigs; it can also improve feeding conditions and improve feeding quality. Relevant industrial departments should produce a large number of feed grinders, slicers, mixers, water pumps, power machinery, and transportation vehicles to meet the needs of large-scale pig farms in a timely manner. In order to ensure that the reform of pig raising tools is carried out in a faster, better, and more economical manner, we must adhere to the principle of "walking on two legs," make full use of the strength of the handicraft sector, actively manufacture small chaff cutters, indigenous tap water equipment, manure trucks, and indigenous railways, and achieve a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and promote both simple tools and mechanized equipment.
    There are many other things that industry can do to support the development of pig raising. Such as increasing the production of serum, vaccines, aphrodisiacs, disinfectants, artificial insemination devices, and injection equipment. At the same time, relevant factories and enterprises should take the initiative to cooperate with scientific research institutions, medical and health departments, and universities to actively research and trial-produce new varieties of feed and epidemic prevention drugs, and help the people's communes raise more, fatter, and stronger pigs.

### 加强工业对养猪的支援

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    加强工业对养猪的支援
    1月11日，南京新华日报以“加强工业对养猪事业的支援”为题发表社论。摘要如下：
    支援养猪事业大发展，这是当前工业支援农业的一项重要内容。养猪事业的高速发展，势必会在物质技术条件和劳动力等方面带来一系列的新问题。猪的食量很大，要大养特养其猪，就要大力开辟饲料来源，扩大饲料加工。养猪的劳动量很大，无论是饲料加工、送料、用水，还是运肥，都需要大量的劳动力。猪养得多，需要的劳动力就更多，大量养猪和劳动力不足的矛盾就会越来越尖锐。集体饲养的规模扩大了，防疫隔离等工作比起过去私养和小规模公养来，就更显得迫切了。同时，对药械的需要量也就会越来越大。要大规模地养猪，还要大搞猪舍、猪栏等基本建设，对砖、瓦、竹、木等建筑材料的需要量就会激增起来。当然，以上这一系列的新问题，很多是可以而且应该依靠人民公社自己的力量就地解决的。但是，在不少方面还需要工业部门和手工业部门的支援，在大规模发展养猪的开始阶段，更是如此。因此，各工业和手工业部门都应该迅速行动，为发展养猪事业而贡献力量。
    加强饲料加工工作，是支援养猪事业大发展的一个重要方面。饲料从哪里来？当然，首先是要由人民公社发扬自力更生的精神，千方百计地种植、采集和储存一切可以利用的饲料；但是，在城市和很多工厂企业部门，也有很多饲料资源，需要广为挖掘，充分利用。除了粮食加工厂的砻糠、麸皮和油厂的豆饼、花生饼等外，像酒厂的酒糟，糖厂的糖渣、废丝、青头，罐头厂的蛋壳、骨头以及其他有关工厂的下脚，经过加工处理和综合利用，都可以充作比较好的饲料。粮食加工部门，还要结合业务，充分利用加工设备，为公社加工饲料。
    在支援养猪事业的工作中，还要抓好养猪工具改革这一环。大搞养猪工具改革，可以大大减轻劳动强度，用少数的人，养大量的猪；还可以改善饲养条件，提高饲养质量。有关工业部门应该大量生产饲料粉碎机、切片机、搅拌机、水泵、动力机械和运输工具等，及时供应各地大型养猪场的需要。为了保证养猪工具改革多快好省地进行，我们必须坚持“两条腿走路”的方针，充分运用手工业部门的力量，积极制造小型切草机、土自来水设备、送粪车和土轨道等，做到土洋结合，简易工具和机械化设备同时并举。
    工业支援养猪事业的发展，还有许多事情要做。如增产血清、疫苗、催情素、消毒药品、人工授精器和注射用具等。同时，有关工厂企业还要主动配合科学研究机关、医药卫生部门和高等学校，积极研究试制饲料和防疫药品的新品种，帮助各人民公社把猪养得更多、更肥、更壮。
