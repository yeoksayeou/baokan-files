Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 25th: The Korean Central News Agency reports that the joint communiqué of the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic was published here today.

The communiqué states that the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Heinrich Rau, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, paid a visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from January 19 to 24 at the invitation of the Korean government. During the visit, the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic held talks with the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Kim Il, member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and First Deputy Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. During the talks, the two sides discussed the current international situation and a series of important issues of concern to both countries, and reached complete consensus on all issues discussed.

The communiqué said that both sides pointed out that due to the rapid growth and development of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and its sincere efforts, international tensions are tending to ease. Both sides believe that the new measure taken by the Soviet government to unilaterally reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million men has made a significant contribution to further easing international tensions and to the cause of world peace, and expressed warm welcome to this.

The communiqué said that both sides resolutely condemned the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which seriously threatens peace in the Far East and Asia.

Both sides emphasized that the issue of Korean reunification is an urgent one, and that the withdrawal of U.S. imperialism from South Korea is a prerequisite for a peaceful solution to the Korean question. Both sides resolutely condemn the U.S. imperialists' continued occupation of South Korea, turning the area into its colony and base for atomic warfare, and carrying out aggressive policies of adventurous war provocations, and strongly advocate that the U.S. aggressor troops immediately withdraw from South Korea. The communiqué said that West German militarism, which has been revived with the support of U.S. imperialism and its allies, is once again seriously threatening peace in Europe and the world. The two delegations believe that, based on the current German situation, concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanies and normalizing the situation in Berlin are prerequisites for guaranteeing the peaceful and democratic reunification of Germany and peace in Europe. Both sides advocate that representatives of the German Democratic Republic must and should participate in the discussion of all issues related to Germany at the upcoming summit meeting. The communiqué said that North Korea and East Germany support each other's propositions and positions on the peaceful reunification of their respective homelands.

The communiqué said that both sides are particularly concerned about the issue of further consolidating and developing friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. This time, the two governments signed the 1960 Protocol on Exchange of Goods and Payments, and both sides reached an agreement to hold talks for the conclusion of a long-term trade agreement.

    谴责美国威胁亚洲和欧洲和平
    双方决定进一步巩固和发展友好合作关系
    据新华社平壤25日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯，这里今天发表了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团和德意志民主共和国政府代表团的联合公报。
    公报说，以德国统一社会党中央政治局委员、德意志民主共和国副总理海因里希·劳为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团应邀在1月19日到24日期间在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行了访问。访问期间，德意志民主共和国政府代表团同以朝鲜劳动党中央常务委员会委员、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁第一副首相金一为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团举行了会谈。在会谈中，双方讨论了目前的国际局势和两国关心的一系列重要问题，对讨论的所有问题双方取得了完全一致的意见。
    公报说，双方指出，由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的迅速壮大发展和它进行了有诚意的努力，国际紧张局势趋向缓和。双方认为，苏联政府又一次单方面裁减武装部队一百二十万人的新措施对进一步缓和国际紧张局势和世界和平事业作出了重大贡献，并对此表示热烈欢迎。
    公报说：双方坚决谴责了严重地威胁着远东和亚洲和平的日美军事同盟条约的缔结。
    双方强调，朝鲜的统一问题是迫切的问题，美帝国主义从南朝鲜撤走是和平解决朝鲜问题的先决条件。双方坚决谴责美帝国主义继续强占南朝鲜并把这一地区变成它的殖民地和原子战争基地、进行冒险的战争挑衅的侵略政策，并强烈主张，美国侵略军立即从南朝鲜撤走。公报说：在美帝国主义及其同盟者的支持下复活了的西德军国主义又严重地威胁着欧洲和世界和平。两国代表团认为，从目前德国局势出发，同两个德国缔结对德和约，并使柏林局势正常化是保障德国的和平的民主的重新统一和欧洲和平的先决条件。双方主张在今后举行的首脑会议上有关德国的一切问题的讨论，必须而且应该有德意志民主共和国的代表参加。公报说：朝德双方相互支持各自的关于和平统一祖国的主张和立场。
    公报说：双方特别关心进一步巩固和发展两国之间的友好合作关系问题，这一次两国政府签订了1960年换货和支付议定书，双方并达成协议将为签订长期贸易协定举行会谈。
