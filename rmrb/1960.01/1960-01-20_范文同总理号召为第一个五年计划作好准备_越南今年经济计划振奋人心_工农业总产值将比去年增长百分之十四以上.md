　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th—According to reports in newspapers here today: Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam said at a conference held at the Prime Minister's Office of Vietnam on the 18th to convey the 1960 National Plan that 1960 is an extremely important year. It is not only the final year of the Three-Year Plan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but also a year in which to prepare for the Five-Year Plan, especially the 1961 plan.
　　Representatives from various departments of the Vietnamese government and various localities attended the meeting.
　　Pham Van Dong said that the issue of agricultural production measures in 1960 is doubly important compared to 1959. In 1959, North Vietnam was in general production conditions and adopted not very high technical measures, but the output still exceeded that of 1958. Now, to raise the level of agricultural production in 1960 to exceed that of 1959 (especially striving to increase rice yield per hectare by 100 to 200 kilograms), it is necessary to gradually adopt newer technical measures.
　　Premier Pham Van Dong said that this year, in addition to rice production, special attention should be paid to the production of corn, sweet potatoes, and cassava. In addition to being used for food, these crops can also be used as feed and for export. He also emphasized the importance of planting cash crops. He said that this is of great significance to exports, the light industry sector, and the chemical sector.
　　Pham Van Dong finally said that the workload in 1960 is very large and complex. We must find ways to do our work more smoothly and better with the existing manpower. We must find ways to strengthen our forces in terms of organization, management, and technology.
　　Vietnam's "People's Daily" published an editorial today on Vietnam's 1960 National Plan, saying that the implementation of the 1960 National Plan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will enable the economy and culture of North Vietnam to take a step forward. The total output value of industry and agriculture will increase by 14.3% compared to 1959, with agriculture increasing by 11.5% and industry and handicrafts increasing by 19.2%. The grain output in 1960 is expected to reach 5.5 million tons, an increase of 300,000 tons compared to 1959. The total output value of means of production produced by industry and handicrafts will increase by 29.9%, and the total output value of consumer goods will increase by 14.7%. The investment in basic construction will increase by 40.2%.
　　The editorial said that the state-owned economy in North Vietnam will be further developed and consolidated in 1960. State-owned industry will account for 82.4% of the total industrial output value, the retail sales of state-owned commerce will account for 36% of the total retail sales of commodities, and the freight volume of state-owned transportation will account for 73.6% of the total freight volume.
　　The editorial said that these are encouraging indicators, which show that under the brilliant light of the Labor Party, the lives of the people in North Vietnam will become increasingly happy. These indicators herald the victory of the socialist construction cause in North Vietnam, marking the increasingly rapid, great, and solid development of the Vietnamese revolutionary cause.
　　The editorial said that the victorious realization of the 1960 National Plan will bring new development to the socialist construction cause in North Vietnam and will provide a more solid foundation for Vietnam's struggle for the reunification of the motherland.

    范文同总理号召为第一个五年计划作好准备
    越南今年经济计划振奋人心
    工农业总产值将比去年增长百分之十四以上
    新华社河内19日电　据此间报纸今天报道：越南民主共和国总理范文同18日在越南总理府为传达1960年国家计划而召开的会议上发表讲话说，1960年是极其重要的一年。它不仅是越南民主共和国三年计划的最后一年，而且在这一年里要为五年计划、首先是1961年的计划作好准备。
    出席这个会议的有越南政府各部门和各地方的代表。
    范文同说，1960年的农业生产的措施问题比1959年有加倍的重要性。1959年，越南北方处在一般的生产条件下和采用了不很高的技术措施，但是产量仍超过了1958年。现在要把1960年的农业生产水平提高到超过1959年的水平（特别是争取稻谷每公顷产量增加一百到二百公斤），就必须逐步采用更新的技术措施。
    范文同总理说，今年除了稻谷生产以外，还要特别重视生产玉米、番薯和木薯。这些农作物除了供食用以外，还可以用来作饲料和出口。他还强调了种植经济作物的重要性。他说，这对输出、轻工业部门、化学部门都有很大的作用。
    范文同最后说，1960年的工作量非常巨大和复杂，我们必须设法在原有的人力的情况下，把工作做得更顺利、更好；必须设法从组织、管理和技术方面加强我们的力量。
    越南“人民报”今天就越南1960年国家计划发表社论说，越南民主共和国1960年国家计划的实现将使越南北方的经济和文化向前跨进一步。工农业总产值将比1959年增长14．3％，其中农业增长11．5％，工业和手工业增长19．2％。1960年的谷物产量预计将达到五百五十万吨，比1959年增长三十万吨；工业和手工业生产的生产资料的总产值将增长29．9％，消费品总产值将增长14．7％。基本建设的投资额将增长40．2％。
    社论说，1960年越南北方的国营经济将得到进一步的发展和巩固。国营工业将占工业总产值的82．4％，国营商业的零售额将占商品零售总额的36％，国营运输业的货运量将占总运货量的73．6％。
    社论说，这是振奋人心的指标，它说明了在劳动党的光芒照耀下，越南北方人民的生活将日益幸福。这些指标预告越南北方社会主义建设事业的胜利，标志着越南革命事业的日益迅速、巨大和稳固的发展。
    社论说，胜利地实现1960年国家计划，将使越南北方的社会主义建设事业获得新的发展，将使越南争取统一祖国的斗争获得更巩固的基础。
