    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 3rd - China's first hydropower station to use underground water in a karst region, the Liulangdong Hydropower Station, generated electricity on the afternoon of New Year's Eve in 1959.

    Liulangdong is located in Qiubei County, Yunnan Province. Three underground water sources converge and flow out of the cave, forming a tributary of the Nanpan River - the Liulang River. This river has very rich water resources. It is five kilometers long with a drop of twenty meters, making it the river with the largest developed drop in China.

    The Liulangdong Hydropower Station officially started construction in March 1958. Its main project - the water diversion tunnel - is more than 3,200 meters long and more than three meters in diameter. It passes through a large mountain with complex and fractured rock layers before the water can be diverted to the Nanpan River for power generation. Thanks to the builders' soaring enthusiasm and overcoming the difficulties of serious collapses, the tunnel was opened in May 1959; and from August, the efficiency of concrete pouring was gradually improved.

    This hydropower station has two units with a total installed capacity of 25,000 kilowatts. After it is put into production, it will provide sufficient electricity for the continued leap forward of the iron and steel and non-ferrous metal industries in the Kaiyuan and Gejiu areas in 1960.

    我国首次利用地下水发电
    云南六郎洞电站建成
    新华社昆明3日电　我国第一座在喀斯特地区利用地下水发电的六郎洞水电站，已经在1959年除夕下午发电。
    六郎洞在云南省丘北县境，三条地下水汇集，从洞口流出，成了南盘江的一条支流——六郎河。这条河有很丰富的水力资源，河长五公里，落差达二十米，是我国目前已经开发的落差最大的河流。
    六郎洞水电站于1958年3月正式动工，它的主体工程——引水隧洞，全长三千二百多米，直径三米多，穿过一座地质复杂的破碎岩层大山，然后才能把水引向南盘江边发电。由于建设者们发挥了冲天的干劲，战胜严重塌方的困难，1959年5月打通了隧洞；并从8月起逐渐提高了混凝土的浇灌效率。
    这座水电站有两套机组，装机容量共为二万五千瓩。它投入生产后，为开远、个旧地区的钢铁和有色金属工业在1960年继续跃进，提供了充足的电力。
