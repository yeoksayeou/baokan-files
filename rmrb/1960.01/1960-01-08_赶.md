    Catch Up

    The national pig raising and manure accumulation campaign has already formed a high tide. How to push this movement to a new high tide? This is a question that leaders at all levels need to consider at present.

    Under the call and leadership of the Party, a situation of great development in pig raising has emerged across the country. Since September of last year, the number of pigs raised has been rising linearly: September increased by 11% compared to June, October increased by 5.4% compared to September, and November increased by 9% compared to October. So, can places where the pig raising industry is developing well continue to develop at a high speed? Can places where the pig raising industry is developing slowly speed up? The headline news published on this page today provides strong material for studying this issue.

    By mid-December 1959, Changyuan County, Henan, had 90,000 pigs, an increase of 1.6 times compared to the end of June. From the perspective of the whole county, the number has more than doubled in half a year, which cannot be considered slow. However, after an in-depth inspection, the potential for developing pig raising is still very large. At that time, eight advanced production brigades in the county had emerged, some of which had reached one pig per mu of land, and some had reached one pig per person. However, more production brigades were far behind this level, and even twenty-four brigades had an average of more than fifty mu of land for each pig. This imbalance in the development of the movement powerfully illustrates that there is still huge potential for developing pig raising.

    The problem raised by Changyuan County has universal significance and is very enlightening for us to further strengthen the leadership of the pig raising and manure accumulation campaign. Under the current situation of great development in pig raising, all localities need to conduct an in-depth inspection and analysis of the movement in a timely manner, help backward units catch up with advanced ones in a timely manner, and turn the advanced pig raising level into a social level, so that the pig raising and manure accumulation campaign can have a greater and better development.

    How to help backward areas catch up with advanced levels? Changyuan County's experience is also very good. In the process of vigorously developing the pig raising and manure accumulation campaign, they conscientiously used the leadership method of grasping both ends to bring along the middle. They paid attention to cultivating the advanced and setting up models, and also promptly grasped the backward and caught up with the advanced, while driving the middle to catch up. In order to help backward areas catch up with the advanced, Changyuan County organized cadres from advanced areas to go to backward areas, use vivid facts to promote the benefits of pig raising and manure accumulation, introduce the experience of developing pig raising, and help local cadres and the masses overcome negative emotions and improve their enthusiasm for pig raising and manure accumulation. While solving ideological problems, it is also necessary to effectively solve the practical difficulties in developing pig production. In addition to strengthening leadership in political ideology, fully mobilizing the masses, and improving the understanding of cadres and the masses, and establishing the ambition to develop pig production, the Changyuan County Party Committee also strengthened leadership in backward areas, helped backward areas train technical personnel, transferred sows and boars to help them solve the problem of pig sources, held feed exhibitions to promote feed collection, and organized advanced areas to help backward areas solve other various difficulties. In this way, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses in backward areas was boosted, and a upsurge of "learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced" was launched.

    The backward catch up with the advanced, and the advanced become even more advanced, and the pig raising and manure accumulation movement will develop wave after wave.

    赶
    全国养猪积肥运动已经形成高潮，怎样把这个运动推向新的高潮？这是当前各级领导需要考虑的问题。
    在党的号召和领导下，全国出现了养猪大发展的局面，从去年9月以来，养猪头数直线上升：9月比6月增加11％，10月比9月增加5．4％，11月比10月又增加9％。那么，养猪业发展得好的地方还能不能继续高速度地向前发展？养猪业发展较慢的地方能不能加快速度？今天本版发表的头条消息，对研究这个问题提供了有力的材料。
    河南长垣县到1959年12月中养猪九万头，比6月底增加一点六倍。从全县来看，半年增加一倍多，这不能不算快；可是深入地一检查，发展养猪的潜力仍然很大。当时全县已经出现了八个养猪先进生产大队，他们有的达到一亩地一头猪，有的达到一人一头猪；可是，更多的生产大队远远落后于这个水平，甚至还有二十四个大队平均五十亩地以上才有一头猪。运动发展的这种不平衡状况，有力地说明了还蕴藏着发展养猪的巨大潜力。
    长垣县提出的这个问题具有普遍意义，对我们进一步加强养猪积肥运动的领导很有启示。在目前养猪大发展的形势下，各地都需要不失时机地对运动进行一次深入地检查和分析，及时帮助后进单位赶上先进，让先进的养猪水平变成社会水平，就能使养猪积肥运动有一个更大更好的发展。
    怎样帮助后进地区赶上先进水平呢？长垣县的经验也很好。他们在大搞养猪积肥运动中，认真地运用抓两头带中间的领导方法。既注意培养先进、树立标兵，又及时地抓后进、赶先进，同时带动中间迎头赶上。长垣县为了帮助后进地区赶上先进，他们组织先进地区的干部到后进地区，用活生生的事实宣传养猪积肥的好处，介绍发展养猪的经验，帮助当地干部和群众克服消极情绪，提高养猪积肥的积极性。在解决思想问题的同时，还要切实地解决发展养猪生产中的实际困难。长垣县委除了在政治思想上加强领导，充分发动群众，提高干部和群众的认识，树立发展养猪生产的雄心大志外，还对后进地区加强了领导力量，帮助后进地区培训技术人员，调剂母猪、种猪，帮助他们解决猪源问题，举办饲料展览，推动饲料采集工作；并且组织先进地区帮助后进地区解决其它各种困难。这样，就把后进地区干部和群众的干劲鼓起来了，掀起了“学先进、赶先进”的热潮。
    后进赶先进、先进更先进，养猪积肥运动就会一浪高一浪地发展起来。
