Xinhua News Agency, January 14th -- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China today issued a statement regarding the signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Ignoring the resolute opposition of the Japanese people, and disregarding the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and peace-loving people of all countries around the world, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi has decided to go to the United States on the 16th of this month and sign a Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty with the U.S. government in Washington on the 19th, under the guise of revising the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. This is an extremely serious step by the Japanese reactionaries and U.S. imperialism colluding with each other to prepare for new aggression and war, threatening peace in Asia and the world

The Chinese people have always been concerned about the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and against the revival of Japanese militarism. Since Nobusuke Kichi came to power, the Chinese government has repeatedly pointed out the danger of the Japanese reactionaries, with the support of U.S. imperialism, actively reviving Japanese militarism and carrying out external expansion. Now, the Chinese government cannot but solemnly point out that this danger has become a reality. The signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty marks the revival of Japanese militarism and marks Japan's open participation in the U.S.'s aggressive military bloc. This cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of the people of Asian countries.

In order to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism and the resurgence of Japanese aggression, the Allied countries concluded a series of international agreements during World War II and after Japan's surrender. The U.S. government has an obligation to abide by these agreements. The U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is in direct violation of these solemn international agreements.

Thanks to the joint efforts of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, as well as peace-loving countries and peoples, the current international situation has seen a certain degree of relaxation. The U.S. ruling clique also flaunts peace and constantly makes gestures expressing their willingness to ease international tensions. However, it is at this very moment that the United States and Japan are signing a military alliance treaty. This once again proves that the U.S.'s goal is aggression and war, and that its so-called relaxation and peace are merely a cover for its preparations for war.

The government of the People's Republic of China firmly opposes the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. We believe that the Japanese people will wage a persistent struggle to thwart the schemes of the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries. The times have changed. No matter how rampant the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries may be, their evil schemes to enslave the Japanese people and threaten the people of Asian countries are doomed to failure.

    中华人民共和国外交部发表声明
    我国坚决反对日美军事同盟条约
    签订日美军事同盟条约是美日反动派互相勾结，准备新的侵略和战争，威胁亚洲和世界和平的极其严重的步骤；它标志日本军国主义的复活和公然参加美国侵略性军事集团，不能不引起亚洲各国人民的严重警惕；它又一次证明美国的所谓和缓和和平，不过是准备战争的掩护。相信日本人民将进行坚持不懈的斗争，为挫败美日反动派的阴谋而努力。
    新华社14日讯　中华人民共和国外交部今天发表关于日美签订军事同盟条约的声明。声明全文如下：
    日本首相岸信介不顾日本人民的坚决反对，不顾中国人民和全世界爱好和平的各国人民的一再警告，决定于本月16日赴美，19日在华盛顿以修改日美安全条约为名，同美国政府签订日美军事同盟条约。这是日本反动派和美帝国主义互相勾结，准备新的侵略和战争，威胁亚洲和世界和平的一个极其严重的步骤。
    中国人民一向关心日本人民争取独立、民主、和平和中立、反对日本军国主义复活的斗争。自从岸信介登台以来，中国政府更不断指出日本反动派在美帝国主义扶植下积极复活日本军国主义和对外进行扩张的危险性。现在，中国政府不能不严正指出，这种危险性已经成为现实的了，日美军事同盟条约的签订，标志着日本军国主义的复活，标志着日本已经公然参加美国的侵略性的军事集团。这不能不引起亚洲各国人民的严重警惕。
    为了防止日本军国主义的复活和日本侵略的再起，同盟国家在第二次大战期间和日本投降以后曾经缔结过一系列国际协定，美国政府负有义务遵守这些协定。美日军事同盟条约是同这些庄严的国际协定完全违反的。
    由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和爱好和平的国家和人民的共同努力，目前的国际局势出现了一定程度的和缓。美国统治集团也标榜和平，并且不断作出愿意和缓国际紧张局势的姿态。但是，正是在这个时候，美国和日本签订军事同盟条约，这就又一次证明了，美国的目的是侵略和战争，所谓和缓和和平，不过是它准备战争的掩护。
    中华人民共和国政府坚决反对日美军事同盟条约。我们相信，日本人民将进行坚持不懈的斗争，为挫败美日反动派的阴谋而努力。时代已经变了，不管美日反动派如何猖獗，他们奴役日本人民、威胁亚洲各国人民的罪恶阴谋是注定要失败的。
