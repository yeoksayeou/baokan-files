Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 23rd: At a plenary meeting of the Central Council of Trade Unions on the 22nd, the General Secretary of the Hungarian Trade Union, Brücho, reported that the work of the Hungarian Trade Unions had improved greatly in the past year, effectively promoting the development of production.

He said that the sense of responsibility and political awareness of the workers in accelerating socialist construction had been raised to an unprecedented level. The gift-giving tasks of various units to welcome the Party Congress last year were overfulfilled, and the technical innovation movement formed a new upsurge.

At present, the labor emulation upsurge to greet the 15th anniversary of the motherland's liberation and ensure the victorious completion of the annual plan is rising day by day. More than 4,400 labor teams across the country are working hard to win the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team." These labor teams have put forward specific measures to increase production, practice economy, and improve political awareness and technical level.

Brücho pointed out that the trade unions should better promote the development of labor emulation, exchange advanced experiences of various production units in a timely manner, give full play to the enthusiasm and construction enthusiasm of the vast number of workers, and do a better job in the technical innovation movement, so as to rapidly increase labor productivity.

He said that more than 10,000 workers studied in 200 factory schools last year, and more than 20,000 people attended night school. In the future, political and cultural education for workers should be further strengthened through various forms.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 24th: According to the "People's Liberty Daily" report: The Seventh Plenary Meeting of the Central Council of Hungarian Trade Unions issued a call to workers across the country, calling on them to launch socialist emulation and strive to fulfill and overfulfill Hungary's 1960 national economic development plan.

The Seventh Plenary Meeting of the Central Council of Hungarian Trade Unions supported the proposal of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, believing that it is necessary to develop the labor emulation launched by the Hungarian working people to welcome the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Hungary into a year-long competition, and strive to overfulfill the 1960 economic development plan and prepare a good starting point for the second five-year plan. To this end, the plenary session called in its call to the Hungarian workers to strive to make the industrial sectors that are guaranteed in terms of raw material and power supply and finished product sales overfulfill this year's production plan, calling on them to adopt new technologies and new operating methods in production and better organize labor, so as to strive to greatly increase labor productivity.

The call requires the working people to implement a high degree of thrift in daily labor production, and requires better cooperation between various industrial sectors and industrial enterprises, so that production can develop in a balanced manner. The call also calls on all employees to accelerate the completion of the task of developing production technology.

The Central Committee of the Hungarian Trade Union called on the workers in the industrial sector to overfulfill this year's production plan, increase the production of more products, and improve product quality; calling on them to produce more agricultural machinery in order to create a technical basis for the socialist transformation of agriculture. The call requires the workers in the construction industry sector to vigorously shorten the construction period and improve the quality of construction.

The Central Committee of the Hungarian Trade Union called on the workers of state-owned farms across the country to continue to increase the production of agricultural commodities, increase the yield of crops and animal husbandry, vigorously reduce the labor time required for the production of each quintal of agricultural products, and reduce the cost of animal products. It requires agricultural machinery stations to continue to improve work quality, overfulfill technical quotas, and save raw materials, fuels, and transportation equipment.

Finally, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Trade Union called on the trade union organizations, economic leaders, and the vast number of workers in industrial enterprises across the country to quickly formulate the labor emulation tasks of their units and put forward this year's gift-giving tasks.
