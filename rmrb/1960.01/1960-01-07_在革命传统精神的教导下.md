Visiting North Korea

    Under the Guidance of the Revolutionary Tradition Spirit
    Hu Jiwei, Cai Xiuben
    Everywhere in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, you can hear songs from the era of the Anti-Japanese Guerrillas. The radio broadcasts guerrilla songs every day, every school teaches guerrilla songs, and we attended several factory and agricultural cooperative evening parties during our visit to North Korea, where the first program was always a chorus of Anti-Japanese Guerrilla songs.
    Why do the Korean people love the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla songs so much? Because they are enthusiastically studying the history of the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla forces led by Comrade Kim Il-sung, and are striving to inherit and carry forward the fine revolutionary tradition. Through their studies, they have developed an indomitable revolutionary will, cultivated a hard-working style of resolutely overcoming all difficulties, enhanced the highly optimistic fighting spirit of communists, and ignited a burning enthusiasm for forever pursuing a better future!
    The most brutal American imperialists carried out the most insane bombings here. The gentlemen in Washington could use the most brutal means to destroy all construction in the Republic, but they could not destroy this great nation. When the Korean people emerged from air-raid shelters and cellars after defeating American imperialism, the entire country was truly in ruins, and not a single complete house remained in Pyongyang, a city with hundreds of thousands of people. The victorious Korean people did not stop moving forward for a moment in the face of this miserable scene. After successfully completing the Three-Year Reconstruction Plan, they began the great First Five-Year Plan. The fact that the First Five-Year Plan's total industrial output value plan could be completed two and a half years ahead of schedule, and that such brilliant achievements could be obtained, was the result of the Korean people launching the "Chollima" movement. To carry out such a large-scale construction plan at such a high speed under such difficult conditions, it was particularly necessary to cultivate people's tenacious spirit of overcoming all difficulties. The mass revolutionary tradition education conducted by the Korean Workers' Party among the people has achieved amazing results in this regard.
    In March 1957, a giant new cement plant was being built in the Madong area, not far from Pyongyang. Thousands of young people persisted in working in the freezing cold, eating in the freezing cold, and sleeping in the freezing cold. Sometimes, they worked day and night, and when people were already very tired at midnight, they would light a roaring bonfire, sing songs from the era of the Anti-Japanese Guerrillas, and dance dances from the era of the Guerrillas. Encouraged by the revolutionary tradition spirit of the Guerrillas, people threw themselves into new battles with enthusiasm after the singing and dancing, urging the early arrival of a happy tomorrow.
    In the "Chollima Work Team" of the Hwanghae Iron Works, there was a worker comrade named Kim Tae-do. Once, a problem occurred with the tapping hole of the blast furnace, and molten iron surged out. When the molten iron at a temperature of 1,000 degrees Celsius met the humid air, it exploded, and he was surrounded by flames. At this moment of impending disaster, the heroic image of the guerrilla era appeared before him, and the glorious example encouraged him. He bravely operated the tap-hole plugging machine and finally used clay to plug the tap hole, saving the factory. He wrote on the glorious "Red Booklet" (Note 1): "This heroic spirit was given to me by the Party. The Party has consistently educated and cultivated me with such a revolutionary spirit."
    In February 1959, at the construction site of the superphosphate calcium factory, which was being newly built at the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, the machines had already been delivered, but the foundation work had not been completed, and they could not be installed on time. At that time, it was the coldest time of the year, and the ground was frozen solid, making it very difficult to dig the earth. The Party organization of the infrastructure workshop held a "Red Fighter Evening Party." The vice-chairman of the workshop's Professional Alliance (Note 2) told stories of the Anti-Japanese Guerrillas, the workers recited guerrilla poems, and everyone sang guerrilla songs. Thus, a tenacious struggle to overcome the severe cold began. Hard work is the foundation of clever work. The workers' soaring enthusiasm created many good ways to dig frozen soil, such as using waste heat to thaw the soil, which greatly improved work efficiency and ensured that the machines were installed on time.
    The famous Zhu Eul Flax Factory is the founder of the great "machine tool producing machine tool" movement. Originally, their machine repair workshop only had three old Japanese simple lathes. However, in order to expand hemp rope production and meet the needs of the country's developing fishing industry, this small factory set up ambitious goals: to expand equipment through self-reliance. Starting in March 1959, they produced a total of forty-four various lathes (including twenty-eight universal lathes, one gantry planer, and one gear milling machine) and two semi-automated iron-smelting furnaces; they then used these lathes to produce a complete set of textile machines from flax fiber production to weaving flax cloth, and four complete sets of hemp rope machines, as well as many other machines, equipping themselves and supporting others. A small hemp rope factory undertook the arduous task of a universal machine tool factory and a hemp machinery factory, and equipped itself into a modern large hemp rope factory. What a glorious and brilliant achievement. They overcame difficulties that people could not imagine. Comrade Zhang Jinyu, secretary of the factory's Party committee, said: "We simply produced it by gritting our teeth." Listen, "Gritting our teeth!" "Produced it hard!" What a precious spirit this is! If it were easy to produce without gritting your teeth, and if a machine tool factory or a machinery factory produced these products, what would be so particularly valuable about it? Why could they have such a strong will? Why could they create such brilliant achievements amidst thousands of difficulties? The worker comrades said that we studied the history of the Anti-Japanese Guerrillas. The guerrilla forces led by Premier Kim Il-sung at that time could still make guns and hand grenades even without weapons. We still have three old lathes. Why can't we make lathes and make machines? — Again, revolutionary tradition education gave people endless power.
    Singing songs from the guerrilla era gives people a fighting spirit that never slackens; reading stories from the guerrilla era gives people the drive and wisdom to overcome any difficulty. Now, they have already used this arduous, extraordinary, and creative labor to unveil the prelude to a happy life. On this land that was most severely damaged by war in the world, now, not only have all the war scars that covered the body been completely cleared away, but also earth-shattering miracles have been created: in more than 170 counties in the northern half of North Korea, most counties have a modern state-owned industrial and mining enterprise, and each county also has an average of a dozen small and medium-sized local industrial and mining enterprises. What a solid foundation for national industrialization. The countryside has long since completed collectivization, and agricultural production has increased by more than half compared to the time of the armistice. The poor peasants, who accounted for 40% of the farming households at the time of the armistice, now have a standard of living that has risen to above that of middle peasants. The countryside has basically achieved water conservancy, 88% of the villages have electricity, and a high tide of agricultural mechanization is now underway. The construction of cities and villages is developing at an even higher speed, and the proportion of prefabricated component assembled houses has increased to 40% of the total construction area; there are high-rise buildings everywhere, brand-new cities everywhere, and rows of neat rural cultural residences everywhere; all kinds of cranes are continuously transporting prefabricated components day and night. A simple house can be assembled in just a few minutes, and a house with water and heating equipment can be assembled in eight hours. "High-rise buildings rise from the ground in one month, and hundreds of families move into new homes." This is the "Pyongyang speed" that people admire.
    Comrade Kim Do-man, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department of the Korean Workers' Party, told us: "This kind of revolutionary tradition education is a part of the Party history education, and in the past year or two, it has formed a nationwide mass learning movement. In order to carry out this study, under the leadership of the Central Propaganda Department, the theoretical and academic circles, literary and artistic circles, and news and publishing circles of North Korea have made tremendous efforts. In terms of learning materials, in the past two years, two volumes of 'Lectures on the History of Struggle of the Korean Workers' Party,' six volumes of 'Collections of Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Struggle Stories,' two volumes of 'Memoirs of Comrades Who Participated in the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Forces,' and some lecture outlines have been published. According to incomplete statistics, in 1959 alone, sixteen novels, fourteen poems, five films, nine operas, six dramas, thirteen picture albums, and twenty-six paintings related to the Anti-Japanese Guerrillas were published. In recent years, more than a dozen collections of Anti-Japanese Guerrilla songs and ballads, and many popular reading materials and children's reading materials about the Anti-Japanese Guerrillas have also been published. The Party Central Committee also sent a revolutionary historical site investigation team to the areas where Comrade Kim Il-sung led the guerrilla forces to collect a large number of souvenirs, enriching the Pyongyang Revolutionary History Museum. Each factory, each school, and each agricultural cooperative has a Party history research room, displaying many replicas of the Pyongyang Revolutionary History Museum, which has become a research room for the masses to study revolutionary traditions. Children's summer camps have also been built in famous guerrilla war battlefields such as Pochonbo, allowing Young Pioneers to take turns going there to learn about the revolutionary deeds of the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla era. This revolutionary tradition education is very deeply rooted in people's hearts." Comrade Kim Do-man told us that a few days ago, he went to the dormitory of the Sports Academy to see the lives of the students, and in one room, he saw a girl crying, and two boys were also very excited. The minister thought there was some dispute, but upon inquiring, he learned that they had studied the "Memoirs" of the guerrilla war and had just had a heated discussion.
    The result of this nationwide learning has cultivated an extremely noble quality in the Korean people, which is to resolutely respond to the Party's call, resolutely implement Comrade Kim Il-sung's instructions, and resolutely complete whatever the Party and the leader call for. When people accept any task assigned by the Party, they do not emphasize difficulties, but first bravely take it on, despise difficulties, and try every means to overcome all difficulties to ensure the superior completion of the task. Comrade Han Seol-ya, Chairman of the Korean Writers' Union, told us: "The highest standard for the Korean people to complete tasks is not 100%, but more than 100%, it's 200%, or even more; completing 100% is just the most basic responsibility." What a noble quality! What a heroic spirit!
    The Korean people harbor great hatred for the fact that American imperialism still occupies South Korea; the Korean people endure great pain for the fact that the motherland has been vividly divided into two worlds by American imperialism. The Korean Workers' Party educates the people to transform this hatred and pain into a powerful driving force for building socialism, and also educates the people to recognize the long-term and arduous nature of the Korean revolution, and to educate the people to make all preparations for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, especially to make ideological preparations, to prepare to meet all difficulties, and to develop the confidence and ability to overcome all difficulties. Their beautiful vision is to build the entire Korea into a communist paradise.
    In the face of the well-tempered Korean people, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome, because they have cultivated a noble quality that can overcome all difficulties!

    在革命传统精神的教导下
    胡季委　蔡修本
    在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国土上，到处都可以听到抗日游击队时代的歌曲。每天的广播都播送游击队时代的歌曲，每一个学校都教唱游击队时代的歌曲，我们访问朝鲜时参加过几次工厂和农业社的晚会，第一个节目都是抗日游击队歌曲大合唱。
    朝鲜人民为什么那样热爱抗日游击队的歌曲呢？因为他们正在满腔热情地学习着金日成同志领导的抗日游击队的历史，努力继承和发扬优良的革命传统。他们从学习中锻炼了百折不挠的顽强的革命意志，培养了坚决战胜一切困难的苦干作风，增强了共产党人高度乐观主义的战斗精神，激发了永远追求美好未来的火炽的热情！
    最残暴的美帝国主义在这里进行了最疯狂的轰炸。华盛顿的老爷们可以用最残暴的手段破坏共和国的一切建设，但是它却毁灭不了这个伟大的民族。战胜了美帝国主义以后，朝鲜人民从防空洞和地窖里走出来的时候，真是全国一片废墟，几十万人口的平壤市没有留下一座完整的房屋。胜利了的朝鲜人民在这种凄惨的景象面前并没有一刻停止前进。他们胜利结束了三年恢复计划以后，就开始了伟大的第一个五年计划。第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划能够提前两年半完成，能够得到这样辉煌的成就，是朝鲜人民开展了“千里马”运动的结果。要在那样困难的条件下高速度地进行那样规模宏大的建设计划，就特别需要培养人们那种战胜一切困难的顽强精神。朝鲜劳动党对人民进行的群众性的革命传统教育，在这方面收到了惊人的成效。
    1957年3月，在离平壤不远的马洞地区，建设一个巨型的新水泥厂。成千上万的青年在冰天雪地下坚持工作，在冰天雪地里吃饭，在冰天雪地里睡觉。有时，他们夜以继日地坚持工作，在午夜人们已经十分疲劳的时候，就升起熊熊的篝火，唱起抗日游击队时代的歌曲，跳起游击队时代的舞蹈，在游击队的革命传统精神的鼓舞下，人们在歌舞以后又满腔热情地投入了新的战斗，催促着幸福的明天早早到来。
    在黄海制铁所“千里马作业班”里，有一位叫金太道的工人同志。有一次高炉的出铁口发生了毛病，铁水汹涌奔流，一千度高温的铁水遇到潮湿的空气发生了爆炸，烈火包围了他。在这大难临头的时刻，游击队时代的英雄形象出现在他前面，光辉的榜样鼓舞着他，他奋不顾身地操纵着堵口机，终于用粘土把出铁口堵住，挽救了工厂。他在光荣的“红本子”（注一）上这样写着：“这种英勇的气魄是党给我的，党一贯地以这样的革命精神来教育和培养我。”
    1959年2月，在兴南肥料厂正在新建的过磷酸钙工厂的工地，机器已经运来了，但基础工程还没有完工，不能按时安装。那时，正是最寒冷的时候，地冻三尺，挖土十分困难。基建车间的党组织就召开了一个“红色战士晚会”，车间职业同盟（注二）副委员长讲了抗日游击队的故事，工人们朗诵了游击队的诗，大家合唱了游击队的歌曲，于是一场战胜严寒的顽强斗争展开了。苦干是巧干的基础，工人们的冲天干劲创造了很多挖冻土的好办法，比如利用废弃的热气来解冻，就大大提高了工效，保证机器按时安装。
    有名的朱乙亚麻厂是伟大的“机床生产机床”运动的创始者。原来，他们的机修车间只有三台破旧的日本简易车床。但是为了扩大麻绳生产、满足祖国发展渔业的需要，这个小小的工厂树立了雄图大志：自力更生扩大装备。从1959年3月开始，一共生产了四十四台各种车床（包括二十八台万能车床、一台龙门刨床、一台齿轮铣床）和两座半自动化的炼铁炉；又用这些车床生产了一整套从制亚麻纤维到织出亚麻布的纺织机，和四整套麻绳机，还有其他很多机器，装备了自己又支援了别人。一个小麻绳厂担当了万能机床厂和麻类机械厂的艰巨任务，而且把自己装备成一个现代化的大麻绳厂，这是何等光辉灿烂的成就。他们克服了人们想像不到的困难，工厂党委委员长张锦玉同志说：“我们简直是咬紧牙关硬生产出来的。”听，“咬紧牙关！”“硬生产出来！”这是一种多么宝贵的精神啊！如果不咬紧牙关很容易就生产出来了，如果是一个机床厂或者机械厂生产出这些产品，那有什么特别可贵呢？他们为什么能有这样坚强的意志？为什么能在千难万苦中创造出这样辉煌的成就呢？工人同志们说，我们学习了抗日游击队的历史，金日成首相当时领导的游击队，在手无寸铁的条件下还能造枪造手榴弹，我们还有三台旧车床，为什么不能造车床、造机器呢？——又是革命传统教育给了人们无穷的力量。
    高唱着游击队时代的歌曲，给人们以永不松懈的战斗精神；朗读着游击队时代的故事，给人们以战胜任何困难的干劲和智慧。现在，他们已经用这种艰苦卓越的创造性的劳动，揭开了幸福生活的序幕。在这个世界上被战争破坏得最严重的国土上，现在，不仅完全扫清了遍体鳞伤的战争痕迹，而且创建了惊动天地的奇迹：在朝鲜北半部一百七十多个郡中，大部分郡都有一个现代化的国营工矿企业，每个郡还平均有十几个中小型的地方工矿企业，这是多么坚实的国家工业化的基础啊！农村早已完成合作化，农业生产比停战时提高一半以上。停战时占农户40％的贫农，现在生活水平已经提高到中农以上。农村已经基本上实现水利化了，88％的乡村有了电，现在正开展着农业机械化的高潮。城市和乡村的建设，更是高速度发展，预制构件的装配式房屋的比例，已经提高到整个建筑总面积的40％；到处是高楼大厦，到处是崭新的城市，到处是一排排整齐的农村文化住宅；各式各样的起重机日夜不停地运吊预制构件，十几分钟就可以装配一套简易住宅，八小时就可以装配一座拥有水暖设备的住宅。“一月高楼平地起，百户人家换新居”，这就是人们所惊佩的“平壤速度”。
    朝鲜劳动党中央宣传部部长金道万同志对我们说：“这种革命传统教育是党史教育的一部分，近一两年来已经形成了一个全国性的群众学习运动。为了进行这一学习，在中央宣传部的领导下，朝鲜的理论学术界、文学艺术界和新闻出版界作了巨大的努力。在学习教材方面，两年多来出版了‘朝鲜劳动党斗争史讲义’两本，‘抗日游击队斗争故事集’六本，‘参加抗日游击队的同志们的回忆录’两本，和一些讲演提纲。据不完全统计，仅仅在1959年一年就出版了有关抗日游击队的小说十六部、诗十四部、电影五部、歌剧九部、话剧六部、画册十三本和绘画二十六幅。几年来还出版了抗日游击队歌曲和歌谣集十几部，和很多关于抗日游击队的通俗读物和儿童读物。党中央还派出了革命历史遗迹调查队，到金日成同志领导游击队活动过的地区，搜集了大量纪念品，充实了平壤革命历史博物馆。各工厂、各学校、各农业社都有党史研究室，陈列了平壤革命历史博物馆的很多复制品，成为群众学习革命传统的研究室。在普天堡等游击战争名战场，还修建了儿童夏令营，让少先队员们轮流到那里去学习抗日游击队时代的革命事迹。这一革命传统教育是十分深入人心的。”金道万部长同志对我们说，前几天他去体育学院宿舍看看学生的生活，在一个房间里看见一个女生在哭，两个男生也很激动。部长同志以为发生了什么纠纷，一打听，原来他们学习了那本游击战争“回忆录”，刚刚进行了热烈的讨论。
    这一全民性学习的结果，已经在朝鲜人民中培养出一种极为高贵的品质，就是坚决响应党的号召，坚决贯彻金日成同志的指示，党和领袖叫做什么就坚决去完成。人们在接受党分配的任何任务时，不是强调困难，而是首先勇敢地担当起来，是蔑视困难，是千方百计地去排除万难，保证优越地完成任务。朝鲜作家同盟委员长韩雪野同志对我们说：“朝鲜人民完成任务的最高标准不是100％，而是100％以上，是200％，或者更多；完成100％吗，那只是人们最起码的责任。”这是多么高贵的品质！多么豪迈的气魄！
    对于美帝国主义至今仍然霸占着南朝鲜，朝鲜人民怀着极大的仇恨；对于祖国被美帝国主义活生生地分裂为两个世界，朝鲜人民忍受着极大的痛苦。朝鲜劳动党教育人民把这种仇恨和痛苦转化成建设社会主义的强大动力，而且教育人民认识朝鲜革命的长期性和艰苦性，教育人民为了和平统一祖国作好一切准备，特别是作好思想准备，要准备迎接一切困难，要锻炼出能够战胜一切困难的信心和本领。他们的美好远景是把整个朝鲜都建设成共产主义的乐园。
    在千锤百炼的朝鲜人民面前，没有什么克服不了的困难，因为他们已经培养出一种能够战胜一切困难的高贵品质！
