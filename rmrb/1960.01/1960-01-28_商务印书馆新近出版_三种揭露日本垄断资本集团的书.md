Three Books Exposing Japanese Monopoly Capital Groups

History Must Not Repeat Itself

The Commercial Press has recently published the Chinese translation of "Japanese Monopoly Capital During the Second World War" by Soviet scholar Lukyanova. In this book, the author analyzes the face of Japanese monopoly capital based on rich historical materials, proving that monopoly capital is the master of militarism. The author points out that after Japanese capitalism developed to the stage of monopoly, a few financial oligarchs controlled Japan's major industrial sectors and determined Japan's internal and external policies. Due to the backwardness of the domestic economic base caused by feudal remnants,
Japanese imperialism was particularly aggressive.

In order to seize the highest profits and get rid of the deep domestic capitalist contradictions, the monopoly capital group ruthlessly exploited the working people on the one hand, and actively launched wars of aggression on the other. Before World War II, Japanese monopoly capital frantically expanded its armaments and prepared for war, implemented economic militarization, and especially used warlords as tools for its aggressive policies.

Lenin once pointed out: "Japan had the possibility of exploiting Oriental countries and Asian countries, but without the assistance of other countries, it did not have independent financial and military strength." The fact is exactly like this. The plundering wars carried out by Japanese imperialism in the past were all carried out with the assistance of imperialism, especially American imperialism. Before World War II, the United States and other imperialist countries tried to make Japan a tool for anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities in the Far East. Therefore, they adopted a policy of concession to Japan's expansion of its sphere of influence in the Far East and gave Japan's aggressive activities various open and covert assistance. At the same time, the American monopoly group also infiltrated its own forces into some important industrial sectors of Japan through this assistance.

However, wars of aggression and economic militarization could not enable Japanese monopoly capital to find a way out of the crisis. Instead, they brought extremely serious consequences to Japan. The author cited many concrete materials to prove that economic militarization caused Japan's peaceful industry to shrink sharply, and the military industry developed畸形地. During World War II, the production level of Japan's most important cotton textile industry regressed by fifty years, and a large number of small weaving owners and small silk reeling owners also went bankrupt in large numbers. This situation caused a huge waste of productivity and greatly reduced the consumption of residents. At the same time, due to the expansion of armaments and war preparations and foreign aggression, the working masses were subjected to more brutal exploitation and had to bear heavy military expenditures. The people's lives became more impoverished, which further deepened the contradiction between production and consumption. The competition among various monopoly organizations also strengthened the anarchy of production and made the internal and external contradictions of Japanese imperialism more acute. The economic chaos and difficulties in Japan under American occupation are the inevitable result of the development of this contradiction.

This book powerfully illustrates that the road of militarism is a sinful road that endangers the interests of the Japanese and world people. To crush the conspiracy of the Japanese and American reactionaries to restore Japanese militarism is a serious task facing the people of the world, especially the Japanese people. The current struggle of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is the central task of this overall task.

The Reactionary Essence of Japanese Militarism

"Japanese Militarism" written by Japanese progressive historian Inoue Kiyoshi helps us understand the history of Japanese militarism and recognize today's potential militarist forces in Japan. This book has recently been translated and published by The Commercial Press.

Based on historical materials from the end of the Edo shogunate to the end of the Taisho period in Japan (approximately from the end of the eighteenth century to 1925), the author deeply explored the inevitability of the occurrence, development, and collapse of Japanese militarism.

The author points out that Japanese militarism was built on the basis of the Emperor system, semi-feudal agricultural production relations, and monopoly capitalism, so it has a particularly strong aggressiveness. The author exposes the aggressive activities of Japanese imperialism in annexing Korea, launching the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, and invading Siberia, exposing the hideous face of Japanese militarism.

While exposing the above-mentioned aggressive activities of Japanese militarism, the author pointed out its inevitable trend of collapse. The plundering wars launched by Japanese militarism did not solve Japan's internal and external contradictions. Instead, they "developed on a new scale, in new forms, and with new elements." The author uses rich historical materials to illustrate that the failure of Japanese militarism in armed intervention in the great socialist revolution in Siberia was a precursor to the collapse of Japanese militarism. Japan's defeat in World War II powerfully proves this point.

Now, the Japanese and American reactionaries have revised the "Security Treaty" in defiance of world opinion, attempting to officially revive Japanese militarism. Japan's new militarism is subordinate to American imperialism. Due to the rapid development of monopoly enterprises after World War II and the basic elimination of feudal remnants, the economic foundation on which the new militarism relies is also different from the past. Japan's new militarism has a more obvious reactionary nature.

In this book, the author also explores the reform of the Japanese military system, the establishment and development of bureaucratic autocratic politics, and so on.

The Culprit of the War is the U.S.-Japan Monopoly Group

"History of the Pacific War" is a work collectively written by the Japanese Historical Society. The book consists of five volumes, the first volume of which was translated and published by The Commercial Press in November 1959, and the remaining volumes will be translated and published successively this year.

Regarding the history of World War II, bourgeois historians in their works always try their best to distort the causes and nature of the war, thereby shirking the war responsibility for the monopoly capital group. In order to eliminate the fallacies of these kept scholars, the authors of this book collected rich historical materials and used historical materialism to correctly explain the nature and origin of the war in the Pacific region of World War II. They pointed out that the culprit of the war of aggression was a small group of Japanese monopoly capital groups, and the Japanese warlords and their entire set of state machines were the executors of their will. In analyzing the international situation during Japan's preparation for the Pacific War, the authors sternly exposed the foreign policy of the United States. The book cites a large number of facts to prove that before the Pearl Harbor incident, the United States did not provide sincere assistance to the invaded countries, but instead supplied arms to the Japanese aggressors, using Japanese aggression to serve American monopoly capital.

Through this historical fact, this book shows the Japanese people who have suffered deeply from the disaster of war that they must rise up and resolutely oppose all the sinful acts of the Japanese ruling class attempting to revive Japanese militarism, and must rise up and resolutely oppose the Japanese reactionary government's attempt to drag Japan into the aggressive group planned by American imperialism.

    三种揭露日本垄断资本集团的书
    历史不许重演
    商务印书馆最近出版了苏联学者卢基扬诺娃写的“第二次世界大战期间的日本垄断资本”一书的中译本。在这本书中，作者根据丰富的历史材料剖析了日本垄断资本的面貌，证明了垄断资本是军国主义的主宰。作者指出，日本资本主义发展到垄断阶段以后，少数金融寡头控制了日本各重要产业部门，并决定着日本的内外政策。由于封建残余所造成的国内经济基础的落后，
    日本帝国主义的侵略性特别强烈。
    为了攫取最高利润，并摆脱国内深刻的资本主义矛盾，垄断资本集团一方面残酷地压榨劳动人民，另一方面积极发动侵略战争。第二次世界大战前，日本垄断资本疯狂地进行扩军备战，实行经济军事化，特别是利用军阀作为自己侵略政策的工具。
    列宁曾经指出：“日本曾有榨取东方各国、亚细亚各国的可能，但是如果没有其他国家之援助，它却没有独立的财政上的和军事上的力量。”事实正是这样，日本帝国主义历次进行的掠夺战争，都是在帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义的援助下进行的。第二次世界大战前，美国及其他帝国主义国家力图使日本成为远东的反苏反共的工具，因而对日本在远东扩大势力范围采取让步政策，并给予日本的侵略活动以各种公开的和不公开的援助。同时，美国的垄断集团也通过这种援助，把自己的势力渗入日本的某些重要工业部门。
    然而，侵略战争和经济军事化并不能使日本垄断资本找到摆脱危机的出路，反而给日本带来了极其严重的恶果，作者列举了许多具体材料证明，经济军事化使日本的和平工业急剧地萎缩，军事工业畸形地发展了。第二次世界大战时，日本最重要的棉纺织业的生产水平倒退了五十年，为数众多的中小织布业主和小缫丝业主也大批地破产。这种情况造成了生产力的巨大浪费，大大地缩减了居民的消费额。同时，由于扩军备战和对外侵略，劳动群众遭到了更加残酷的压榨，并且不得不担负沉重的军费开支，人民生活更趋贫困，更加加深了生产同消费之间的矛盾。各垄断组织之间展开的竞争，也加强了生产无政府状态，使日本帝国主义的内外矛盾更趋尖锐。美国占领下的日本经济混乱，困难万状，正是这种矛盾发展的必然之果。
    这本书有力地说明了：军国主义道路是危害日本和世界人民利益的罪恶道路。粉碎日美反动势力恢复日本军国主义的阴谋，是摆在世界人民、首先是日本人民面前的一项严重的任务，当前日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争正是这个总任务的中心任务。
                      （胡企林）
    日本军国主义的反动实质
    日本进步历史学家井上清写的“日本的军国主义”，有助于我们了解日本军国主义的历史，认识今天日本的潜在军国主义势力。这本书最近已由商务印书馆翻译出版。
    作者根据日本江户幕府末期到大正末期（大约从十八世纪末到1925年）的史料，比较深刻地探讨了日本军国主义发生、发展及其溃灭的必然性。
    作者指出，日本的军国主义是在天皇制、半封建的农业生产关系和垄断资本主义的基础上建立起来的，因此具有特别强烈的侵略性。作者揭露了日本帝国主义并吞朝鲜、发动甲午战争和日俄战争、侵犯西伯利亚等等侵略活动，暴露了日本军国主义的狰狞面目。
    在揭露日本军国主义的上述侵略活动的同时，作者指出了它的必然溃灭的趋势。日本军国主义发动的历次掠夺战争，并没有解决日本的内外矛盾，反而使“它们在新的规模上，以新的形式，加上新的要素而更加发展起来”。作者用丰富的史料说明，日本军国主义在西伯利亚武装干涉伟大的社会主义革命的失败，就是日本军国主义崩溃的预兆。第二次世界大战中日本的溃败，有力地证明了这一点。
    现在，日美反动势力冒天下之大不韪修订了“安全条约”，企图使日本军国主义正式复活。日本的新军国主义是从属于美国帝国主义的。由于垄断企业在第二次世界大战后的急剧发展及封建残余的基本消灭，新军国主义所凭借的经济基础也不同于过去了。日本的新军国主义具有更加明显的反动性。
    在这本书中，作者还探讨了日本的兵制改革、官僚独裁政治的确立和发展等等。

    战争的罪魁是美日垄断集团
    “太平洋战争史”是日本历史学研究会集体编写的一部著作。全书共五卷，第一卷已由商务印书馆于1959年11月翻译出版，其余各卷将在今年陆续翻译出版。
    关于第二次世界大战的历史，资产阶级历史学家在他们的著作中总是竭力曲解战争的起因和性质，从而为垄断资本集团推卸战争罪责。为了肃清这些御用学者的谰言，本书的作者们收集了丰富的史料，运用历史唯物主义观点，正确地阐述了第二次世界大战太平洋地区战争的性质和发生的根源。他们指出：侵略战争的罪魁是一小撮日本垄断资本集团，而日本军阀及其一整套的国家机器则是它们的意志执行者。作者们在分析日本准备太平洋战争时期的国际形势中，严正地揭露了美国的外交政策。书中举出大量事实证明美国在珍珠港事件以前，对被侵略国家并没有给予真诚的援助，反而把军火源源供应给日本侵略者，利用日本侵略为美国垄断资本服务。
    本书通过这一段史实，向深受战争灾难的日本人民昭示了，必须起来坚决反对日本统治阶级企图复活日本军国主义的一切罪恶行径，必须起来坚决反对日本反动政府企图把日本拖入美帝国主义策划的侵略集团。　（商宣）
