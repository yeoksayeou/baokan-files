Microbalance
    Reacts even to a speck of dust falling on the weighing pan

    The millionth-of-a-gram microbalance, born in Tianjin three months ago, is so precise that it can sense a speck of dust falling on the weighing pan. Even if a single grain of rice is divided into two thousand five hundred parts, it can measure the different weights of each part.

    Who would have thought that this balance was produced by a small factory without any technical personnel - the Tianjin Balance Instrument Factory.

    The Balance Instrument Factory was formed by the merger of two small workshops that repaired ordinary balances. Among the more than one hundred and sixty employees, only a few were old workers who could repair ordinary balances. However, the workers were determined to overcome all kinds of difficulties and break into the scientific "forbidden zone" - successfully trial-producing a millionth-of-a-gram microbalance.

    They had no drawings, so they drew their own; they had no precision machines, so they used files to file away bit by bit. They worked hard and skillfully in this way, and finally successfully completed the trial production task. (Attached picture)

### 微量天平  秤盘上落下一粒灰尘也有反应

    微量天平
    秤盘上落下一粒灰尘也有反应
    三个月前在天津诞生的百万分之一克微量天平，精密到这样的程度：秤盘上落下一粒灰尘就能起感应，即使一颗米粒儿分成了二千五百份，它也能量出每份的不同重量。
    谁能想到，生产这台天平的竟是一个没有技术人员的小工厂——天津天平仪器厂。
    天平仪器厂是两家修理普通天平的小作坊合并成的。在一百六十多个职工中，只有几个会修理普通天平的老工人。可是工人们决心战胜各种困难，闯进科学“禁地”——试制成功了百万分之一克微量天平。
    他们没有图纸，就自己绘制；没有精密机器，就用锉刀一刀一刀地锉。他们就是这样苦干加巧干，终于胜利完成了试制任务。（附图片）
