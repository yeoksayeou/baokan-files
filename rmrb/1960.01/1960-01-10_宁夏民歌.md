Ningxia Folk Songs
　　Changing mountains and rivers by building reservoirs is better than the ocean; diverting river water to the mountain slopes, extracting grain and oil from barren mountains, transforming mountain villages into paradise.

　　Greening barren mountains is like threading a needle with a thousand strands, twisting them into an unbreakable rope; the power of the masses is boundless, transforming barren mountains into orchards.

    宁夏民歌
    改变山河修水库胜过海洋，把河水引上山岗，向荒山索取粮油，把山村变成天堂。
    绿化荒山一根针千条线，拧成一股拉不断；群众力量大无边，荒山变成花果园。
