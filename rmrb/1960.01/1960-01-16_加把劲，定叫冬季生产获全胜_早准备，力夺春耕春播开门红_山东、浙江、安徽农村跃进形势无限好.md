Shandong

    Jinan, January 15th (reporter from this newspaper) – Winter production in Shandong Province has comprehensively formed an excellent situation of simultaneous ideological and production leaps forward.

    Shandong Province has投入over 20 million laborers into winter agricultural production. As of early January, in terms of water conservancy construction, 2.15 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work have been completed, expanding irrigated area by 11.15 million mu, improving irrigated area by 6.18 million mu, controlling soil erosion in mountainous areas of 3,535.4 square kilometers, and controlling waterlogged land of over 6 million mu. In terms of wheat field management, fertilizer has been applied to 53 million mu, accounting for 78% of the total wheat field area; rust disease has occurred in 7.4 million mu of wheat fields, and 5.4 million mu have been treated. The number of pigs in stock has increased significantly, 1.5 times the number in stock in 1958. Large livestock increased by 28,000 heads compared to the end of October last year, and sheep increased by 635,000. Winter plowing and deep turning reached 42.3 million mu, accounting for 87% of the winter fallow land area. Soil improvement reached 11.8 million mu. Afforestation exceeded 70 million mu, completing 200% of the plan. The planting of various economic crops has completed 88% of the plan.

    This year, the characteristics of Shandong's winter production are early action, quick action, and the emergence of large-scale mass production competition movements everywhere, with red flags planted, pacesetters established, and everyone striving to catch up with the advanced. After the Shandong Provincial Party Committee convened a comprehensive winter work on-site conference from late October to early November last year, the wave of mass competition of "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping" reached a new climax. The people of Dashan People's Commune in Junan County straightened out rugged mountainous areas with the perseverance of Yu Gong moving mountains, and Yishui County launched a water conservancy movement to build thousands of reservoirs and ten thousand ponds. As soon as these two examples appeared, the entire Linyi area quickly set off a hot wave of learning from Dashan, catching up with Dashan, learning from Yishui, and catching up with Yishui to control mountains and water. The competition expanded from construction sites to villages and fields, and then developed into a mass "whole family red" movement. More than 80% of the counties, communes, and teams in the province participated in the winter production competition, and millions of new red and expert activists and pacesetters emerged.

    Now, Shandong Province's winter production movement is developing at an even higher speed. A set of preparatory work for spring plowing and sowing, such as farm tool inspection and repair, seed treatment, and elimination of overwintering pests, has also generally started early. Many places emphasize the spirit of "rushing ahead with the work," trying to carry out spring activities in advance during the winter. For example, according to statistics from Junan County at the end of last year, the county has modified 3,793 sets of "Junan Leap Forward Plows" and more than 3,000 close planting seeders with three to five legs (movable legs). More than 6,000 of the existing 8,000-plus walking plows and double-铧plows have been inspected and repaired, and 6,400 of the 7,030 small carts have been repaired. The county's seed warehouses have been surveyed twice, and the commune and team seed warehouses have generally achieved "four withouts," and the state granaries have achieved "seven withouts." The supply of various spring crop seeds is more than sufficient for each commune and team.

Zhejiang

    Hangzhou, January 15th (reporter from this newspaper) – Over 7.98 million commune members in Zhejiang Province are投入in the winter production movement of cultivating winter crops, controlling mountains and water, raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, and improving soil. The movement is progressing rapidly, with high quality, grand momentum, and boiling enthusiasm.

    When managing winter crops, all localities have achieved diligent and meticulous management, seized the opportunity to increase the application of warming fertilizer, and overcome the key obstacles of vigorous growth and overwintering. In cultivation work, many areas have broken with convention, vigorously engaged in tool reform and technological innovation in field management, greatly accelerating the progress, and also improving the quality of agricultural work. All localities have universally established pacesetters and carried out labor competitions between counties, communes, teams, and individuals, and the attendance rate and labor efficiency of commune members have generally increased. The Ningbo area has established more than 16,000 pacesetters at all levels and held more than 5,800 on-site meetings. Currently, more than 2,000 production teams with over one million mu of winter crops have caught up with the pacesetter teams. Now, more than 20 million mu of wheat, barley, rapeseed, and grass seeds across the province are growing well, with a lush green appearance.

    The characteristics of the mountain and water control movement that began last winter in Zhejiang Province are the combination of the two, comprehensive planning, and comprehensive management. During construction, labor is organized uniformly, action is unified, mountains are managed one by one, rivers are managed one by one, and acceptance is carried out after completion of each area, so that afforestation and water conservancy construction are completed in one go. Shanghua People's Commune in Lanxi County summarized the experience of mountain and water control over the years, and while vigorously building water conservancy facilities, they created more than 8,600 mu of various fruit trees and economic forests such as oil tea and tea near farmland and reservoirs to control soil erosion. This mountain and water control experience has been fully promoted in the Jinhua area. As of the 5th, the province has afforested 9.97 million mu, and completed more than 300 million cubic meters of water conservancy earth and stone, an increase of 2.44 times compared to the same period last year.

    In order to achieve balanced and high yields in 1960, the pig raising and fertilizer accumulation movement in Zhejiang is continuing to develop rapidly, and the soil improvement movement is also in full swing. Over 2.93 million mu of low-yielding fields in the province have been improved.

Anhui

    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, January 14th – In the first ten days of 1960, the rural areas of Anhui Province experienced a comprehensive leap forward in various production aspects, firing the first shot for continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1960.

    Following the victory of overfulfilling the winter repair task before the New Year, the water control high-efficiency movement throughout the province saw a series of improvements made by Party committees at all levels in terms of tool reform, labor organization, and construction site layout. The number of advanced water control tools rapidly increased from 1.79 million sets before the New Year to 2.05 million sets, of which the number of high-efficiency tools driven by mechanical power increased by 50% compared to before the New Year. The water control army using these advanced tools has been given wings, making the work efficiency leap again and again. The average daily work efficiency of the province has increased from 10 cubic meters before the New Year to 12.4 cubic meters, with a total of 800 million cubic meters of earth and stone completed in ten days. At the beginning of the New Year, the province organized a large number of laborers to carry out field management of overwintering crops, applying fertilizer, clearing ditches to drain water, and covering with ash and grass to prevent frost, making overwintering crops grow vigorously. On the fertilizer accumulation front, the province focused on raising livestock, and the fertilizer accumulation movement of raising, planting, accumulating, and manufacturing fertilizer in four ways accumulated more than 4.6 billion dan of various natural fertilizers in just ten days.

    A large-scale tree planting and afforestation movement is booming throughout the province. In the past ten days, the province has afforested more than 4.8 million mu, more than twice as much as in the same period last year. In the mountainous area of southern Anhui, the members of the She County People's Communes, under the slogan of "Millions of troops are engaged in greening, we must make the barren mountains wear green robes," afforested more than 45,000 mu on January 1st. Bo County in the Huaibei area also started building plain forest networks on New Year's Day.

    Large-scale spring plowing preparation activities have also achieved significant achievements in the first ten days. In order to expand the area of ​​spring-sown crops, 1.214 million mu of wasteland has been reclaimed in ten days, equivalent to a quarter of the total area of ​​wasteland reclaimed in the province last winter. After being deeply ploughed once at the end of last year, the province's 16.2 million mu of winter fallow land immediately underwent a second deep ploughing in the New Year. Preparations for good seeds, advanced farm tools, and other necessities for spring sowing were also made early and well.

    加把劲，定叫冬季生产获全胜
    早准备，力夺春耕春播开门红
    山东、浙江、安徽农村跃进形势无限好
    山东
    本报济南15日电　山东省农村冬季生产已经全面形成一个思想、生产齐跃进的大好形势。
    山东省投入冬季农业生产的劳力达两千多万人，到1月上旬为止，水利建设，已完成土石方工程二十一点五亿立方米，扩大灌溉面积一千一百十五万亩，改善灌溉面积六百十八万亩，控制山区水土流失面积三千五百三十五点四平方公里，治理涝地六百多万亩。在麦田管理方面，追肥五千三百万亩，占麦田总面积的78％；七百四十万亩发生锈病的麦田，已防治五百四十万亩。养猪存栏头数有很大增加，为1958年存栏头数的一倍半。大家畜比去年10月底增加二万八千头，羊增加六十三万五千只。冬耕深翻四千二百三十万亩，占冬闲地面积的87％。改良土壤一千一百八十万亩。造林七千多万亩，完成计划200％。多种经济生产已完成计划88％。
    今年，山东冬季生产的特点是动手早，行动快，一开始就出现到处插红旗、树标兵，人人争上游赶先进的大规模群众生产竞赛运动。山东省委于去年10月下旬到11月上旬召开了综合性的冬季工作现场会议之后，广大群众“学、比、赶、帮”的竞赛声浪达到了新的高潮。莒南大山人民公社以愚公移山的恒心硬把崎岖的山地整平，沂水县开展千库万塘修水利运动，这两个榜样一出现，临沂全区迅速掀起学大山赶大山、学沂水赶沂水的治山治水热潮。竞赛从工地扩及到村庄田间，继又发展为全民性的“全家红”运动。全省有80％以上的县、社、队参加了冬季生产竞赛，涌现出数百万名新的红专积极分子和标兵。
    现在，山东省冬季生产运动正向更高的速度发展。春耕播种的一套准备工作，如农具检修，种籽处理，消灭越冬虫害等等，也普遍提早动手。很多地方都强调“活路向前赶”的精神，尽量把春活提前到冬季进行。例如莒南县到去年底的统计，全县已改制出“莒南跃进犁”三千七百九十三套，三至五腿（活腿）密植耧三千多部，现有的八千多部步犁、双铧犁已检修过六千多部，七千零三十部小车已检修好六千四百部。全县种子仓库已普查过两遍，社、队种子仓库普遍做到“四无”，国家粮库做到“七无”，各种春作物种子社社、队队自给有余。
    浙　江
    本报杭州15日电　浙江省有七百九十八万多公社社员投入冬种作物培育、治山治水、养猪积肥和改良土壤的冬季生产运动。运动进展快，质量高，声势浩大，热气腾腾。
    各地在管理冬种作物时，做到了勤管、细管，抓紧了增施保暖肥料，大破发棵关和越冬关。在培育工作中，不少地区破除常规，大搞田间管理的工具改革和技术革新，进度大大加快，农活质量也有所提高。各地普遍树立标兵，开展了县与县、社与社、队与队、人与人之间的劳动竞赛，社员出勤率和劳动效率普遍提高。宁波专区共树立了各级标兵一万六千多个，召开现场会议五千八百多次，目前已有二千多个生产队的一百万多亩冬种作物赶上了标兵队。现在，全省两千多万亩大、小麦、油菜和草子生长良好，一片葱绿。
    浙江省在去年冬天开始的治山治水运动的特点是把二者结合起来，全面规划、综合治理。施工时统一组织劳力、统一行动，一个山头一个山头，一条河流一条河流地治理，完工一处验收一处，使造林、修水利一气呵成。兰溪县上华人民公社总结了历年来治山治水的经验，在大力兴修水利的同时，在靠近农田、水库的近山营造各种果树和油茶、茶叶等经济林八千六百多亩，以控制水土流失。这个治山治水经验已在金华专区全面推广。到5日为止，全省已造林九百九十七万亩，完成的水利土石方三亿多方，比去年同期增长二点四四倍。
    为了取得1960年的平衡高产，浙江各地的养猪积肥运动正在继续迅速发展，改良土壤运动也搞得热火朝天，全省已有二百九十三万亩低产田得到改良。
    安　徽
    新华社合肥14日电　安徽省农村在1960年的头十天中，各项生产出现了全面跃进的形势，为1960年继续大跃进打响了第一炮。
    全省治水高工效运动，继年前取得超额完成冬修任务的胜利之后，各级党委又从工具改革、劳力组合、工地布局等方面作了一系列的改进，先进的治水工具由年前的一百七十九万套迅速增加到二百零五万套，其中利用机械动力带动的高工效工具比年前增加50％。使用这些先进工具的治水大军，如虎添翼，使工效一跃再跃。全省平均日工效已由年前十立方米提高到十二点四立方米，十天内共完成土石方八亿立方米。新年一开始，全省就组织了大批劳力进行越冬作物田间管理，追肥、清沟沥水、盖灰草防冻，使越冬作物生长茁壮。在积肥战线上，全省以养为主，养、种、积、制四路攻肥的积肥运动，在短短十天内就积攒各种自然肥料达四十六亿多担。
    大规模的植树造林运动，正在全省蓬勃展开。十天来全省共造林四百八十多万亩，比去年同期多两倍。皖南山区歙县各人民公社的社员们，在“千军万马搞绿化，定叫荒山穿绿袍”的口号下，1月1日造林四万五千多亩。淮北地区的亳县也在元旦开始就大造平原林网。
    全省大规模的备耕活动，在头十天中也取得重大成就。为了扩大春播作物面积，十天内已开荒一百二十一万四千多亩，相等于去年冬季全省开荒面积总和的四分之一。全省一千六百二十万亩冬闲地，在去年底深翻一次以后，新年紧接着进行第二次深翻。春播需要的良种、先进农具等准备工作也做得又早又好。（附图片）
