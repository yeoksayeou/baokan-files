    Short-Term Training, Master-Apprentice System, and Correspondence Courses Proceed Simultaneously
    Shaanxi Cultivates New Force for Agricultural Technology Transformation
    (Our Dispatch) Shaanxi Province's agricultural machinery leading departments are organizing tractor stations, hydropower stations, agricultural machinery factories, and farm implement repair factories in various regions to cultivate agricultural machinery technical personnel quickly, efficiently, and economically through methods such as the master-apprentice system, short-term training classes, and correspondence courses. According to incomplete statistics, from April 1958 to the end of 1959, more than 13,000 technical personnel have been trained, accounting for more than 95% of the province's agricultural machinery technical personnel. Currently, they are driving more than 800 tractors and over 40,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery, actively serving the current agricultural production.
    Since the realization of people's communes in Shaanxi Province, agricultural machinery has increased sharply. The number of diesel engines, kerosene engines, portable steam engines, and electric motors has increased from more than 1,000 horsepower to more than 48,000 horsepower, and an additional 100,000 horsepower is planned for this year. Tractors and other large-scale agricultural machinery have also more than doubled. According to preliminary calculations by relevant departments, the province will need approximately 30,000 agricultural machinery technical personnel this year. If this large number of technical personnel were trained solely by schools, it would take several years. Therefore, in addition to increasing the number of agricultural mechanization colleges, the leading departments of Shaanxi Province are focusing on mobilizing tractor stations, hydropower stations, agricultural machinery factories, and farm implement repair factories to rely on their own efforts and quickly cultivate primary agricultural machinery technical talents. Since 1959, stations and factories have successively held more than 100 training classes, established more than 40 correspondence teaching points, and widely adopted the master-apprentice method, training more than 11,000 agricultural machinery technical personnel. At present, stations and factories are advancing victoriously, absorbing more than 15,000 rural youths, and using the slack winter farming season for training.
    The training forms adopted by the stations and factories are diverse. The first type involves running short-term training classes for tractor, combine harvester, diesel engine, and deep plowing plow operators and repairmen, inviting experienced technical personnel to serve as teachers and compiling easy-to-understand teaching materials for lectures. Students study and operate simultaneously, concentrating on theoretical knowledge during the slack farming season, and learning practical operations in the fields alongside vehicles during the busy farming season. The study period ranges from one to six months. The tractor station of Fangzhen People's Commune in Hancheng County has run two training classes, training 41 tractor drivers, solving the problem of manpower shortage. The second type is the master-apprentice system. Each driver and repairman is responsible for leading one to two apprentices, and the master and apprentice sign contracts guaranteeing instruction and learning. Both teaching and learning focus on practical operations. Yang Zhenyi, a driver at the Yunyang People's Commune tractor station in Sanyuan County, takes students to the fields to learn operations during the day and explains tractor principles to students in the evening, learning by doing, which is very effective. In nine months, he helped young farmers Zhang Yongde, He Chaoguo, and He Shouming learn driving techniques. The third type is correspondence courses. Many stations and factories run correspondence courses to impart technology to the masses. The Huashan Machinery Factory and the Maoling Tractor Repair Factory have dispatched working groups composed of technical cadres to Chang'an, Qianxian, and other places to teach techniques related to the inspection and repair of diesel engines, tractors, etc., which are very popular among the masses. The fourth type is to hold on-the-job training courses for technical personnel, gathering drivers and repairmen in batches for intensive training. They teach and learn from each other, jointly summarize technical experience, and systematically study principles such as "Tractor Structure and Use" and "Diesel Engine Performance," constantly improving their technical level.
    Practice has proven that the methods of running short-term training classes, correspondence courses, and the master-apprentice system by stations and factories are effective ways to cultivate a large number of agricultural machinery technical personnel. Implementing these methods can cultivate agricultural machinery technical personnel quickly, efficiently, and economically. Generally, after only half a year of study, one can drive a tractor. For example, from the winter before last to the spring of last year, the Gaoling People's Commune tractor station in Sanyuan County trained 53 tractor drivers and 45 diesel engine operators. At the same time, it is convenient to connect with reality, and students can work independently after completing their studies. For example, Zhai Baocai of the Xiyang People's Commune tractor station in Sanyuan County, with the help of his master Dong Yongfu, learned and did simultaneously, performing maintenance, repair, and driving hundreds of times, greatly improving his practical work ability. Upon graduation, he was able to drive the tractor independently and perform repairs. He drove for a year without a single breakdown accident.

    短期训练、师傅带徒弟和函授同时并进
    陕西为农业技术改造培植新军
    本报讯　陕西省农业机械领导部门，组织各地拖拉机站、水力动力站、农业机械厂、农具修配厂等单位，用师傅带徒弟、短期训练班、函授等办法，多快好省地培养农业机械技术人材。据不完全统计，从1958年4月到1959年年底，已培养技术人材一万三千多名，占全省农业机械技术人员的95％以上。目前，他们正驾驶着八百多台拖拉机、四万多马力排灌机械，积极为当前的农业生产服务。
    陕西省实现人民公社化以来，农业机械骤增。仅柴油机、煤油机、锅驼机和电动机，就由原来的一千多马力增加到四万八千多马力，今年还计划增加十万马力。拖拉机及其他大型农业机械，也都增加了一倍多。据有关部门初步计算，今年全省大约需要三万名农业机械技术人员。这一大批技术人员，若单由学校来培养，需要好几年的时间。为此，陕西省领导部门除了增办农业机械化院校外，着重发动各拖拉机站、水力动力站、农业机械厂、农具修配厂，自力更生，迅速培养农业机械初级技术人才。1959年以来，各站、厂先后举办了一百多次训练班，建立了四十多个函授点，并普遍采用师傅带徒弟的方法，培养了一万一千多名农业机械技术人员。目前，各站、厂正乘胜前进，又吸收了一万五千多名农村青年，利用冬季农闲时间，进行训练。
    各站、厂培训的形式多种多样。第一种，开办拖拉机、收割机、柴油机、深耕犁等驾驶员、修理工短期训练班，请有经验的技术人员任教师，自编通俗教材讲课。学员边学习边操作，农闲集中上课学习理论知识，农忙跟车下田学习实际操作。学习期限一至六个月。韩城县坊镇人民公社拖拉机站，自办了两期训练班，就培养出四十一名拖拉机手，解决了人手不足的问题。第二种，师傅带徒弟。每个驾驶员、修理工，包干带领一至二名徒弟，师徒订立包教保学合同。教和学都以实际操作为主。三原县云阳人民公社拖拉机站驾驶员杨振义，白天带领学生到田间学习操作，晚上给学生讲解拖拉机原理，边作边学，效果很好。他在九个月中，就帮助青年农民张永德、何朝国、何守明，学会了驾驶技术。第三种，函授。不少站、厂都办有函授，向群众传授技术。华山机械厂、茂陵拖拉机修配厂等，曾经抽调技术干部组成工作组，分别到长安、乾县等地传授有关检修柴油机、拖拉机等方面的技术，很受群众欢迎。第四种，举办在职技术人员轮训班，分批集训驾驶员和修理工。他们互教互学，共同总结技术经验，系统学习“拖拉机的构造和使用”、“柴油机的性能”等原理，不断地提高技术水平。
    实践证明，各站、厂举办短期训练班、函授、师傅带徒弟的方法，是培养大批农业机械技术人员的有效办法。实行这种办法后，可以多快好省地培养农业机械技术人员。一般只要经过半年学习，就会驾驶拖拉机。如三原县高陵人民公社拖拉机站从前年冬天至去年春天，就培养了五十三名拖拉机手、四十五名柴油机手。同时，便于联系实际，学员学习完毕，即可单独地进行工作。例如三原县西阳人民公社拖拉机站翟保才，在师傅董永福的帮助下，边学边做，从保养、检修到驾驶，都亲手做过几百遍，实际工作能力大为提高。一结业，他既能单独驾驶拖拉机，又能进行修理，开车一年，从未发生过停车事故。
