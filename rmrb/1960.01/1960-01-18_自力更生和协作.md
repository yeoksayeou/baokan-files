    Self-Reliance and Collaboration
    Developing pig farming must be based on self-breeding and self-raising, with self-reliance as the primary principle; however, it also requires promoting the communist spirit and carrying out collaboration in all aspects.
    Pig farming in our country has a history of thousands of years, but it has always been a household sideline, so its development has been neither rapid nor balanced. After the Great Leap Forward and the communization of the people in 1958, collective pig farming developed more significantly. However, the speed of development is still uneven among different regions, as well as among different production teams within a commune, due to differences in natural conditions and the foundation of production. Therefore, in order to enable all regions, counties, and even provinces and the whole country with conditions for pig farming to develop the pig farming business at high speed, we must strive to eliminate the old imbalances in pig farming work and establish a new high-level balance. This requires giving full play to the communist spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation among regions and units, and fully leveraging the superiority of the People's Commune with its “large size and high degree of public ownership.” It is necessary to organize necessary collaboration between regions, counties, communes, this production team and that production team. Collaboration can concentrate the advantageous conditions of all parties, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and greatly accelerate the development of pig farming. For example, in terms of pig farming, some areas have more pigs, have pig sources, and have more experience, but lack feed, pastures, and materials for building pig farms; some places have fewer pigs, lack pig sources, and have no pig farming experience, but have more pastures and building materials. Under such circumstances, the local Party committees and commune Party committees can uniformly organize mutual assistance and cooperation between counties, communes, and production teams, use your strengths to make up for my weaknesses, and use my strengths to make up for your weaknesses, support each other, and promote together. The Iron and Steel People's Commune in Gushi County, Henan Province, has already made achievements in organizing intra-commune collaboration. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, this commune organized a series of collaborations among the major brigades in terms of pig sources, pastures, feed, funds, pig farm construction materials, and pig farming technical experience, making the advanced pig farming brigades even more advanced, and the weak pig farming brigades caught up quickly, and the number of pigs increased by 5.9 times in one year. Now the whole commune has more than 87,600 pigs, reaching a high level of an average of two pigs per person and more than one pig per mu of land.
    In addition, in order to develop the pig farming business at high speed, the cooperation and collaboration of industrial, handicraft, and commercial departments are also needed. The industrial departments of Jiangyin, Taizhou, Yangzhou and other counties and cities in Jiangsu Province actively helped communes to process mixed feed and rush to manufacture feed processing machinery, which strongly promoted the development of pig farming.
    Collaboration can generate new forces, which can not only help others overcome difficulties, but also enable their own pig production to be further developed. Only by transforming the advanced pig farming level into the social level can the country's pig farming business leap forward at a higher speed.

    自力更生和协作
    发展养猪业必须以自繁自养、自力更生为主；但是，也需要发扬共产主义精神，开展各方面的协作。
    养猪在我国已有几千年的历史，但一向作为家庭副业，因而发展既不迅速、也不平衡。1958年大跃进和人民公社化以后，集体养猪才有了较大发展。但各个地区之间，以及一个公社内部各生产队之间，由于自然条件和生产基础有所不同，发展速度仍不平衡。因此，要使整个公社、整个县以至全省、全国有条件养猪的地方都高速度地发展养猪事业，就要力求消灭养猪工作中旧的不平衡，建立新的高水平的平衡。这就必须充分地发挥各地区各单位互助协作的共产主义精神，必须充分地发挥人民公社“一大二公”的优越性。在地区与地区之间、县与县之间、公社与公社之间、这个生产队与那个生产队之间，组织必要的协作。协作，可以把各方面的有利条件集中起来，取长补短，大大加快养猪事业的发展速度。例如，在养猪方面，有些地区养猪较多，有猪源，经验也较丰富，但缺乏饲料、牧场和修建猪场的材料；有些地方养猪少，猪源缺乏，也没有养猪经验，但牧场和建筑材料比较多。在这种情况下，各地党委、公社党委就可以统一组织各县、各公社、各生产队之间的互助协作，以你之长、补我之短，以我之长、补你之短，互相支援，共同促进。河南省固始县钢铁人民公社在组织社内协作方面已经作出了成绩。这个公社在党委统一领导下，在各大队之间，从猪源、牧场、饲料、资金、猪场修建材料到养猪技术经验等各方面，组织了一系列的协作，使养猪先进的大队更加先进，养猪工作薄弱的大队迎头赶上，一年之中猪的头数增加了五点九倍。现在全公社养猪八万七千六百多头，达到每人平均两头猪、每亩地一头多猪的高水平。
    此外，为了高速度地发展养猪事业，还需要工业、手工业、商业等部门的配合和协作。江苏省靖江、泰州、扬州等县、市的工业部门，积极帮助公社加工混合饲料、赶制饲料加工机械，有力地促进了养猪业的发展。
    协作可以产生新的力量，既能够帮助别人克服困难，也能够使自己的养猪生产得到进一步发展。只有把先进的养猪水平变为社会水平，全国的养猪事业才能更高速度地跃进。
