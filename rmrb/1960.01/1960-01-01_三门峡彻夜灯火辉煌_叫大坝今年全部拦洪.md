Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, 31st – A cold night descends on Sanmenxia. However, at the Sanmenxia construction site, the night is just like the day, with bustling crowds everywhere. Spotlights and welding sparks illuminate the entire site.

Only a year after the diversion of the river, the three stone islands once known as the "Sanmen Heavenly Barrier" have disappeared before the builders; replacing them is a majestic dam standing on the rushing torrents. In order for the dam to fully retain floodwaters in 1960, the builders are still working hard on New Year's Eve.

The builders shocked the valley in this year and awakened the surrounding dormant mountains. Facing the dam, two high towers have now been erected on the mountain peaks on both sides—these are the tower bases for the cable cranes. The erection team workers spent more than two months erecting the tower bases, and before December 28, they erected each cable, eight hundred and seventy meters long and as thick as a fist, across the valley at a rate of one per day. When this long dragon soars into the sky, it will, together with the tower cranes on the dam body, become the two mechanized main forces for construction on the construction site, one in the sky and one on the ground.

At the lower end of the dam, hydraulic steel pipes are being installed overnight. The inlet diameter of these steel pipes is as high as three or four-story buildings. After the installation is completed, they will swallow the entire Yellow River and drive the turbines to generate strong electricity. This is a crucial project. Installation workers are launching a competition of "fast production, fast transportation, fast installation, and improving the pass rate" in order to overcome technical barriers.

    三门峡彻夜灯火辉煌
    叫大坝今年全部拦洪
    据新华社三门峡31日电　寒夜降临三门峡。但是，在三门峡工地，黑夜仍同白昼一样，到处是忙碌着的人群。聚光灯和电焊火花把整个工地照耀得通明。
    截流仅仅一年，旧日号称“三门天险”的三座石岛，已经在建设者面前销声匿迹；代替它们的，已经是屹立在激流上的一座巍峨的大坝。为了使大坝在1960年起到全部拦洪作用，建设者在岁末之夜仍然坚持施工。
    建设者们在这一年里震惊了峡谷，也唤醒了四周沉睡的群山。面对大坝的两岸山峰上，现在已经耸立起两座高塔——这是缆式起重机的塔座。架设队的工人以两个多月的时间架起了塔座，在12月28日以前又以一天一根的速度，把每根长达八百七十米的拳头粗细的缆索架过了峡谷。等到这条长龙腾空以后，它就同坝体上的塔式吊车一起，一个天上，一个地下，成为工地施工的两支机械化主力部队。
    在大坝的下端，正在漏夜安装水压钢管。这些钢管的进水口直径有三、四层楼房高，安装完成后，它们就将吞进整条黄河的水，去推动水轮机发出强大的电力来，这是一项关键工程。安装职工们为了突破技术关，正在展开“快制、快运、快装，提高合格率”的竞赛运动。
