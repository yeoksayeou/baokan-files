　　Schools Plan Cultivation, Veteran Teachers Enthusiastically Tutor, New Teachers Diligently Study
　　Half of Tongji University's Young Teachers Take to the Podium

　　This newspaper reports Shanghai Tongji University uses "on-site training" and collective cultivation methods, combined with veteran teacher guidance and individual study, to enable the rapid growth and strengthening of new teaching forces. Currently, young teachers account for two-thirds of the total number of teachers at the school, and half of them are already formally teaching courses. The vast majority are able to independently take responsibility for tutoring, answering questions, and leading students in scientific research and production internships, becoming an important force in teaching activities.

　　In recent years, with the vigorous development of education, the school has continuously increased its number of young teachers. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the school established eleven new majors, and the number of students this semester has surged from more than 5,500 to more than 7,700, with the young teacher contingent also rapidly expanding to nearly 400. Therefore, how to plan and rapidly cultivate and improve their professional and political ideological levels has become an urgent task for the school to improve the quality of teaching and scientific research. At the beginning of 1959, the school party committee formulated current and long-term teacher training plans, determining a series of specific measures, such as combining centralized leadership with the mass line, combining short-term training with long-term cultivation, combining improving the level of political theory, strengthening practical training, and improving professional level, and combining improving the existing teacher level with supplementing and cultivating new teachers. They emphasized the bold use of new forces, learning and improving while teaching. While strengthening organizational leadership, the Party committee adhered to putting politics in command and paid attention to ideological education work. The Party committee and heads of Party organizations in various departments frequently participated in and presided over meetings to discuss teacher training work, went deep into teaching and research groups and had heart-to-heart talks with teachers to understand the situation, inspire them to establish lofty ambitions, and help them solve specific problems. As a result, the enthusiasm of all teachers was mobilized. Each department and teaching and research group regarded cultivating and improving teachers as an important part of the work leap forward, and many young teachers made red-and-expert plans to accelerate their self-improvement.

　　When arranging young teachers to participate in teaching activities, each teaching and research group carefully analyzed the specific situation of the teachers, put forward different requirements, and adopted various methods to give them specific help. For the small number of teachers who had a certain amount of teaching experience and had a preliminary grasp of the course content, they were sent to other schools for short-term advanced studies to return to school and open new courses; teachers who could master the course content but lacked lecturing experience were asked to give trial lectures among new teachers to accumulate teaching experience and improve their professional ability; teaching assistants who could not fully grasp the course content were asked to give trial lectures by chapter, section, and semester, and then collectively discuss and help each other to improve; teaching assistants who lacked field work experience were sent to field internships in batches, or to participate in labor or work in production units for a short period of time; Many teaching and research groups also used basic course discussion classes, academic report meetings, teaching group collective lesson preparation and trial lectures, teaching experience exchange meetings, and mutual visits between teaching and research groups to inspire and guide young teachers to develop the spirit of collectivism, learn with an open mind, help each other, learn from each other's strengths, combine individual study with collective cultivation, and improve together.

　　In the cultivation work, veteran teachers also enthusiastically and actively took on the task of guiding young teachers by means of "master leading apprentice" and participating in listening to lectures. The mathematics teaching and research group of the mathematics major, which was newly established the year before last, opened a basic course discussion class. Under the guidance of experienced veteran teachers Hou Xizhong and Zhang Guolong, young teachers gave lectures each time, and then grasped the key points and combined them with practice to conduct in-depth discussions. Vice President Li Guohao opened an elective course on bridge vibration and stability for young teachers in the Department of Railway Roads, Bridges and Tunnels. Many veteran teachers helped young teachers make up for what they lacked. All of this has played a great role in improving young teachers.

　　Young teachers have improved rapidly through practical training. All four young teaching assistants in the hydrology and hydrodynamics teaching and research group have started teaching courses. They formed a red-and-expert team, learning and teaching at the same time. For difficult problems, they relied on those with abilities in scientific research conferences and teaching experience exchange meetings, preparing with division of labor, collectively discussing solutions. Now each of them can master an average of two courses. Most of the young teachers in the Architectural Design Institute affiliated to the Department of Architectural Engineering used to emphasize theory over practice, were unfamiliar with construction drawings, and lacked practical knowledge of materials, costs, and construction. They were timid and fearful when they first started teaching. After a year of "on-site training," they accumulated production knowledge and consolidated and improved their systematic theory. Young lecturer Zhu Bolong's lecture on reinforced concrete combined the actual experience of production design. Students generally reflected that the content was rich and practical, and the language was vivid and specific.

　　At the beginning of this semester, even more young teachers have taken on the heavy task of teaching and scientific research. Five of the eight teaching assistants in the bridge and tunnel teaching and research group have formally started teaching courses, three of whom are also responsible for the new underground railway course that has never been offered before. The young teaching assistants in the tunnel teaching group discussed the content of the lectures before and after each class, checked the teaching effect, and solved difficult problems. They also went deep into the class to listen to students' opinions and overcome shortcomings in a timely manner. Hydrology geology and engineering geology are two new majors born during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Three-quarters of the nineteen teachers in the geological teaching and research group of this major are new teaching assistants who have just graduated from university. Now, together with several middle-aged teachers, they have taken on all the teaching tasks of this major and other professional geology courses.

    学校有计划培养　老教师热情辅导　新教师苦心钻研
    同济大学青年教师半数登讲台
    本报讯　上海同济大学以“现场练兵”和集体培养的方法，结合老教师辅导和个人钻研，使教师新生力量迅速成长壮大。现在这个学校占教师总数三分之二的青年教师，已有半数正式开课，绝大部分能够独立负责辅导、答疑、带领学生进行科学研究和生产实习，成为教学活动中的重要力量。
    几年来，随着教育事业的蓬勃发展，这个学校陆续增加了一批青年教师。1958年大跃进中，学校又建立了十一个新专业，本学期学生人数由五千五百余人激增至七千七百余人，青年教师队伍也迅速扩大到近四百人。因此，如何有计划地高速度地培养和提高他们的业务水平和政治思想水平，就成为学校提高教学和科学研究质量的一个迫切任务。该校党委1959年一开始，就制定了当前的和长远的师资培养规划，确定了集中领导和群众路线相结合，短期训练和长期培养相结合，提高政治理论水平、加强实践锻炼，和提高业务水平相结合，提高现有师资水平和补充、培养新师资相结合等一系列具体办法，并强调大胆使用新生力量，边教边提高。党委在加强组织领导的同时，坚持政治挂帅，注意思想教育工作。党委和各系党组织的负责人，经常参加和主持讨论师资培养工作的会议，深入教研组和教师谈心，了解情况，启发他们树立雄心大志，并帮助他们解决具体问题。这样做的结果，调动了全体教师的积极性。各系各教研组都把培养提高师资列为工作跃进的重要内容之一，许多青年教师订了加速提高自己的红专规划。
    各教研组在放手安排青年教师参加教学活动时，细致分析教师的具体情况，提出不同的要求，并采取多种方法，给他们以具体的帮助。对于少数具有一定教学经验并初步掌握课程内容的教师，就派往外校短期进修，以便回校开新课；已能掌握课程内容，但缺乏讲课经验的教师，就先在新教师中试讲，以积累教学经验，提高业务能力；还不能全盘掌握课程内容的助教，就分章分节分学期试讲，然后集体讨论，相互帮助改进；缺乏野外实际工作经验的助教就分批参加野外实习，或短期参加生产单位的劳动或工作；许多教研组还以基础课讨论班、学术报告会、教学小组集体备课和试讲、教学经验交流会、教研组互相访问等形式，启发和指导青年教师发扬集体主义精神，虚心学习，互助协作，取长补短，个人钻研和集体培养相结合，共同提高。
    在培养工作中，老教师也以“师傅带徒弟”、参加听课等方式，热情积极地负起指导青年教师的任务。前年新办的数学专业的数学教研组开办了基础课讨论班，在富有教学经验的老教师侯希忠、张国隆的指导下，每次由青年教师主讲，然后抓住重点，结合实际，深入讨论。副校长李国豪为铁道道路桥隧系的青年教师开了桥梁振动与稳定的选修课。许多老教师帮助青年教师缺啥补啥。所有这些，都对青年教师的提高起了很大的作用。
    青年教师通过实际锻炼，提高很快。水文水力教研组的四个青年助教已全部开课，他们组成了一个红专小组，边教边学，对于疑难问题，就在科学研究会和教学经验交流会上，能者为师，分工准备，集体讨论解决，现在他们每人已能平均掌握两门课程。建筑工程系附属建筑设计院的大部分青年教师，过去重理论轻实践，对施工图陌生，对材料、造价及施工缺乏实际知识，初上课时心虚胆怯，经过一年的“现场练兵”，积累了生产知识，也巩固提高了系统理论。青年讲师朱伯龙讲钢筋混凝土课，结合生产设计的实际经验，学生普遍反映内容丰富切实，语言生动具体。
    本学期一开始，又有更多的青年教师纷纷上马，负起繁重的教学和科学研究的任务。桥梁隧道教研组的八个助教，已有五个正式开课，其中三个还担负了过去从未开过的地下铁道新课。隧道教学小组的青年助教每节课前后都要探讨讲课内容，检查教学效果，解决疑难问题，还深入班级听取学生意见，及时克服缺点。水文地质和工程地质是1958年大跃进中诞生的新专业之一。这个专业的地质教研组十九位教师，四分之三是大学刚毕业的新助教。现在，他们同几位中年教师一起已经把这个专业和另外专业地质课的教学任务全部负担起来。
