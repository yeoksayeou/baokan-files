    Jin Hua Prefecture Opens Up a New Way to Increase Fertilizer Production
    Using Small Iron Smelting Blast Furnaces to Make Calcium-Magnesium Phosphate Fertilizer
    (Our Newspaper's dispatch) Jin Hua Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, has achieved remarkable results by using idle small iron smelting blast furnaces to vigorously develop calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer production. Currently, counties such as Jin Hua, Lan Xi, Long You, Jian De, and Qu Xian throughout the prefecture have established phosphate fertilizer plants utilizing existing small iron smelting blast furnaces with volumes ranging from 1.5 to 8 cubic meters. They have already produced large quantities of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer, which has greatly supported agricultural production.
    Jin Hua Prefecture began experimenting with using small iron smelting blast furnaces to produce calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer in March and April of last year. Initially, many people believed that small iron smelting blast furnaces could not be used to smelt calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer. After the Shou Chang Phosphate Fertilizer Plant in Jian De County successfully produced calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer using a 1.5 cubic meter small blast furnace, a work team was immediately organized to help the plant summarize its experience, hold on-site meetings to promote it, and train more than 30 technicians for counties such as Jin Hua, Lan Xi, and Long You at the plant. As a result, the number of phosphate fertilizer plants quickly increased to six within one or two months. In order to fully utilize the idle small blast furnaces of varying volumes, the work team focused on providing specific assistance to the Lan Xi Fertilizer Plant, mobilizing workers to improve furnace types, ingredients, and operations, and creating advanced experiences in high-yield, high-quality calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer production using 3 cubic meter and 8 cubic meter small blast furnaces. The 3 cubic meter furnace at this plant averaged 11 to 12 tons per day, with a maximum of over 15 tons, and could operate continuously for 15 to 30 days; the 8 cubic meter furnace averaged 17 tons per day, with a maximum of 25 tons, and a furnace lifespan of about half a month. Product quality improved from less than 7% effective phosphorus at the beginning to 14%. The cost of semi-finished products per ton also decreased from 198.3 yuan in May to about 100 yuan.
    The promotion of advanced experiences has further promoted the technical innovation movement in various phosphate fertilizer plants, and production levels have rapidly improved. Currently, the quality of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer throughout the prefecture has stabilized at 13%-14% effective phosphorus. The Qu Zhou Chemical Plant improved the ingredient ratio, stabilizing the effective phosphorus content of its products at 15%-17%, with a maximum of 18.25%, and a phosphorus conversion rate of over 90%. The lifespan of blast furnaces is generally 15 to 30 days. The 3 cubic meter small blast furnace at the Long You Chemical Plant adopted the "strong wind and high temperature" operating method, extending the furnace lifespan to over 40 days. Addressing the critical shortage of serpentine and coke, the factories boldly carried out conservation and found substitutes, successfully experimenting with replacing 50% of the serpentine with dolomite and 50%-70% of the coke with anthracite coal and broken coke. After being promoted throughout the region, the sources of raw materials were expanded, and production costs were reduced.
    Calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer is an alkaline, slow-release fertilizer that is not soluble in water, which farmers are not accustomed to using. In order to promote the use of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer, on the one hand, it was vigorously promoted to the masses of farmers. The Qu Zhou Chemical Plant also donated 60 tons of products to nearby people's communes free of charge; on the other hand, on-site experiments were conducted at farms and agricultural experiment stations. The test results show that calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer is very suitable for the local acidic and neutral soils, and the yield increase effect is significant. Applying 30 to 60 jin (about 6 jin of effective phosphorus) of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer per mu can increase corn production by 212 jin; rice yields increased by an average of 9.7%, with a maximum of 17.9%. The increase in soybean production is even more significant, averaging around 52%, with a maximum of 81.8%. It is also very effective when applied to other crops such as pumpkins and tomatoes. Therefore, it is welcomed by farmers.
    There is great potential for producing calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer using small iron smelting blast furnaces. First of all, mineral resources for production raw materials (serpentine, dolomite, etc.) are available in many places across the country, and fuel (coke) can also be replaced by anthracite coal; at the same time, existing small local blast furnaces throughout the country can be utilized. For example, the Jin Hua Prefecture has a volume of 158 cubic meters. Fully utilizing these idle small local iron smelting blast furnaces and vigorously carrying out the small-scale local group and small-scale foreign group movements of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer production will make a significant contribution to the continued leap forward in agricultural production in 1960.

    金华专区开辟一条增产化肥的新途径
    用炼铁小高炉造钙镁磷肥
    本报讯　浙江省金华专区利用闲置的炼铁小高炉大搞钙镁磷肥生产，取得显著成绩。目前全专区已有金华、兰溪、龙游、建德、衢县等县，利用原有的容积一点五到八立方米的炼铁小高炉，建立了磷肥厂，已经生产出大批钙镁磷肥，对支援农业生产起了很大作用。
    金华专区利用炼铁小高炉生产钙镁磷肥是去年3、4月间开始试验的。开始，有很多人认为炼铁小高炉不能炼钙镁磷肥。建德县寿昌磷肥厂用一点五立方米小高炉生产钙镁磷肥成功后，立即组织了工作组，帮助该厂总结经验，召开现场会议加以推广，并在该厂为金华、兰溪、龙游等县培训了三十多名技术工人，因而使磷肥工厂在一、二个月内即发展到六个。为了充分利用闲置的不同容积的小高炉，工作组又以兰溪化肥厂为重点进行具体帮助，发动工人改进炉型、配料和操作，创造出三立方米、八立方米小高炉生产钙镁磷肥的高产、优质先进经验。这个厂的三立方米炉平均日产十一至十二吨，最高达十五吨以上，能连续生产十五至三十天；八立方米炉平均日产十七吨，最高二十五吨，炉龄在半个月左右。产品质量从最初含有效磷不到7％提高到14％。每吨半成品成本也从5月份的一百九十八元三角降低到一百元左右。
    由于先进经验的推广，促进了技术革新运动在各磷肥厂的进一步开展，生产水平迅速提高。目前，全专区钙镁磷肥的质量已稳定在含有效磷13％—14％，衢州化工厂改进配料比例，使产品含有效磷稳定在15％—17％，最高达18．25％，磷的转化率在90％以上；高炉炉龄一般在十五至三十天。龙游化工厂三立方米小高炉，采取“强风高温”的操作方法，使炉龄延长到四十天以上。各厂针对蛇纹石、焦炭不足的关键，大胆进行节约和找代用品，试验成功了掺用50％白云石代替蛇纹石，掺50％—70％白煤和碎焦代替焦炭。在全区推广后，扩大了原料来源，降低了生产成本。
    钙镁磷肥是碱性迟效肥料，不溶解于水，农民使用不习惯，为了推广使用钙镁磷肥，一方面向农民群众大力宣传，衢州化工厂还无偿地赠送六十吨产品给附近人民公社；一方面在农场和农业试验站实地试验。试验结果证明，钙镁磷肥很适合当地的酸性和中性土壤，增产效果显著。每亩施钙镁磷肥三十至六十斤（含有效磷六斤左右），可增产玉米二百一十二斤；水稻平均增产9．7％，最高达17．9％。黄豆增产效果更为显著，平均在52％左右，最高达81．8％。施于其他作物如南瓜、西红柿等，也很有效。因此，受到农民欢迎。
    用炼铁小高炉生产钙镁磷肥大有可为。首先，生产原料（蛇纹石、白云石等）的矿物资源在全国许多地方都有，燃料（焦炭）也可用白煤代替；同时可以利用全国各地现有的小土高炉，如金华专区就有一百五十八立方米的容积，充分利用这些闲置的炼铁小土高炉，大搞钙镁磷肥生产的小土群和小洋群运动，将对1960年农业生产的继续跃进作出重大的贡献。
