    (Report from our newspaper) Since the implementation of people's communes in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas a year ago, the people's communes have shown strong vitality, bringing about profound changes in the pastoral areas' political, economic, cultural, and other constructions, as well as people's mental outlook. The people's communes have embarked on a new stage of consolidation, improvement, and rapid development.
    The communization of the people has promoted the great development of animal husbandry production. The total livestock increase rate in the region reached 28.8%, and the total number of livestock increased by 42% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The net increase rate reached 14.5%, and the net increase was 71% higher than last year. Among them, the average net livestock increase in 158 pastoral people's communes reached 16.8%. Lambing season has begun in various pastoral areas. As of December 17, 423,770 head (pieces) of livestock of all sizes have been delivered, with a survival rate of 95.8%.
    The characteristics of Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas are: vast land and sparse population, scarce labor force, and large number of livestock. Therefore, a rough management habit has historically formed. The livestock's condition is often in a state of "half-fat in summer, fat in autumn, thin in winter, and dry in spring," and a large number of livestock are lost every year during the snowy season; the breeding survival rate is not high. This situation had improved after liberation and during the cooperation movement, but it was only fundamentally reversed after the implementation of people's communes. Due to the discovery of the superiority of the people's commune, which is large in scale and public in nature, the practice of grazing in groups, small groups, and following individuals has been implemented, a set of regular feeding management methods has been established, and a series of responsibility systems have been promoted. As a result, the breeding survival rate of livestock in 1959 reached 73.73%, an increase of 13.88% on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, which is the highest level in history; the number of adult livestock deaths decreased by 25% compared to 1958, which is the lowest level in history. The number of surviving improved lambs is equal to 5.7 times the total number of improved lambs in the past seven years.
    The realization of people's communes in pastoral areas has greatly liberated the productive forces and unified the mobilization of manpower, enabling large-scale basic construction and other undertakings that could not be carried out in 1958 to develop vigorously. The vast majority of communes have established fixed winter and spring camps, built sheds and pens in the camps, dug wells, and stored a large amount of fodder; many communes have also built earthen houses in the camps. From then on, the nomadic life of herding livestock in pursuit of water and grass, regardless of cold or heat, wind or snow, by men, women, and children, has basically ended. There are now more than one million new and old sheds and pens in the region; more than 6,900 new wells were dug in 1959, which is equal to 80% of the total from 1953 to 1958; 67 canals were opened, which is equal to eight times the number of canals opened in the past four years; there are more than 260,000 mu of fodder bases with irrigation conditions, which is more than seven times that of 1958. In 1958, the region harvested 7.4 billion catties of grass, with an average of more than 720 catties of grass for each large livestock (small livestock at a discount of 50%); among them, Xilingol League, which has the most livestock, harvested 1.7 billion catties of grass, more than double that of last year. With water, grass, sheds, pens, and fodder, coupled with the hard work of the commune members, general natural disasters can be basically controlled. The communization has enabled animal husbandry production to embark on a stable, comprehensive, and high-speed development path in just one year.
    With the birth of the people's communes, the original basically single animal husbandry production on the grasslands has now been gradually replaced by a diversified production that is mainly animal husbandry, combined with industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. This year, the grain and fodder base in pastoral areas has an average of more than three mu per person. Most herdsmen have eaten fresh vegetables. Pig and chicken raising have also developed. There are now more than 84,000 pigs raised in pastoral areas, close to one pig per household. Most communes have built small processing plants for dairy products, leather, iron and wood, bricks and tiles, boot making, and food processing on the grasslands, making use of local conditions and materials, which has further prospered the pastoral economy and accelerated the industrial development of the grasslands. Sideline production is unprecedentedly active, turning dead treasures on the grasslands into living treasures.
    The development of production has greatly improved the material and cultural life of the people in pastoral areas. Many communes have established collective welfare undertakings such as hospitals, clinics, maternity stations, schools, shops, nurseries, homes for the elderly, bookstores, clubs, libraries, and public canteens at settlements, and some have also installed electric lights, telephones, and wired broadcasting stations. The first distribution of income after communization is now underway. According to statistics from more than 200 basic accounting units that have completed the distribution, more than 90% of the commune members have increased their income.
    Comrades of all ethnic groups have established deep friendships in common production labor, learning from each other, respecting the living habits of each ethnic group, and the new relationship of common progress among all ethnic groups has been further consolidated and developed.

    牧民欢呼公社好　草原喜庆大丰收
    内蒙古畜牧业高速度发展
    1959年度牲畜总增殖数比1958年提高42％
    本报讯　内蒙古牧区实现人民公社化一年来，人民公社已显示了强大的生命力，使牧区的政治、经济、文化等各项建设和人们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，人民公社已经走上了巩固、健全和迅速发展的新阶段。
    人民公社化促进了畜牧业生产的大发展，全区牲畜总增殖率达到28．8％，总增殖数比大跃进的1958年提高了42％，纯增殖率达到14．5％，纯增殖数比去年提高71％。其中一百五十八个牧区人民公社平均牲畜纯增达16．8％。现在各地牧区已经开始接冬羔。到12月17日，已接大小牲畜四十二万三千七百七十头（只），成活率达95．8％。
    内蒙古牧区的特点是：地广人稀、劳动力少、牲畜多。因此，从历史上就形成了粗放的经营管理习惯。牲畜的膘情经常处于“夏半、秋肥、冬瘦、春干”的境况，每年风雪季节都要损失大量牲畜；繁殖成活率不高。这种情况在解放后和合作化过程中已经有了好转，但实现人民公社化才得到根本的扭转。由于发现了人民公社一大二公的优越性，实现了分群、小群、跟人放牧、建立了一套正规的饲养管理办法和推行了一系列的责任制度，因而1959年牲畜的繁殖成活率达到73．73％，在1958年大跃进的基础上又提高13．88％，为历史上最高的水平；成畜的死亡数却比1958年下降了25％，为历史上最低的水平。成活的改良羊羔，等于过去七年改良羊总和的五点七倍。
    牧区人民公社化的实现，大大解放了生产力，统一调动了人力，使1958年无法进行的大规模基本建设和其他事业，蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。绝大部分公社都建立了固定的冬春营地，在营地上盖了棚圈，打了水井，储存了大量的饲草饲料；有很多公社还在营地盖了土房。从此基本上结束了不分寒暑，不论风雪，男女老少赶着牲畜追逐水草而居的游牧生活。现在全区有新旧棚圈一百多万座（间）；1959年新打井六千九百多眼，等于1953年到1958年五年总和的80％；开渠六十七道，等于过去四年所开渠的八倍；有灌溉条件的饲料基地二十六万多亩，等于1958年的七倍多。1958年全区打草七十四亿斤，平均每头大牲畜（小牲畜五折一）备草七百二十多斤；其中牲畜最多的锡林郭勒盟，打草十七亿斤，比去年增加了一倍多。有水有草、有棚圈、有料，再加上社员辛勤的劳动，就可以基本上控制一般的自然灾害。公社化刚刚一年，就使畜牧业生产走上了稳定、全面、高速度发展的道路。
    随着人民公社的诞生，草原上原来基本上是单一的畜牧业生产，现在已逐步的被以牧为主，工、农、商、学、兵相结合和农、林、牧、副、渔相结合的多种生产代替了。今年牧区的粮食饲料基地，平均每人就有三亩多。大部分牧民吃到了新鲜的蔬菜。养猪、养鸡等也有发展，现在牧区已养猪八万四千多口，接近每户一口猪。大部分公社都在草原上因陋就简，就地取材，兴办了乳品、皮革、铁木、砖瓦、制靴、食品等小型加工厂，进一步繁荣了牧区经济，加速了草原的工业发展。副业生产空前活跃，使草原上的死宝变活宝。
    生产的发展，大大改善了牧区人民的物质和文化生活。有很多公社在定居点上建立起医院、卫生院、接生站、学校、商店、托儿所、敬老院、书店、俱乐部、图书馆、公共食堂等集体福利事业，有的还安装了电灯、电话和有线广播站。现在正在进行着公社化后的第一次收益分配。据已经分配完了的二百多个基本核算单位的统计，90％以上的社员增加了收入。
    各民族社员在共同的生产劳动中，都建立了深厚的友谊，互相学习，尊重各民族的生活习惯，各民族共同前进的新关系更进一步的和巩固发展起来。（附图片）
