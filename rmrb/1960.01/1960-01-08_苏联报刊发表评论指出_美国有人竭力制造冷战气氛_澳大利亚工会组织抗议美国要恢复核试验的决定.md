Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 6th: The latest issue of the Soviet magazine "New Times" published an article stating that the United States' refusal to stop nuclear explosions under the pretext that the Geneva conference would not succeed is unfounded. The article pointed out that if anything would seriously worsen the prospects of the Geneva Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests, it would be the US government's decision.

The article said that Western newspapers pointed out that the US government's decision was made by those in the United States who wanted to continue nuclear testing because they believed that continuing nuclear testing was a way to hinder the relaxation of the international situation, create a Cold War atmosphere, and return to a policy of strength.

The article also pointed out that the US Atomic Energy Commission and the Pentagon had long attempted to resume nuclear testing and hinder the work of the Geneva conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 6th: Today, the "Soviet Naval Gazette" published a commentary condemning the United States for continuing the arms race.

The commentary reminded people to pay attention to the attitude and tricks of some people in the United States who oppose improving the international situation.

The commentary said that in Washington, there are still many people who promote the so-called "strategy of tomorrow" and advocate the use of atomic weapons in "limited wars."

The commentary pointed out that various groups in the United States are currently fighting over military spending. These groups unanimously demand increased military appropriations. The Pentagon believes that allocating a military budget of $40 billion, as was the case last year, is not enough to meet the needs of "resolutely transitioning to the rocket and nuclear age."

The commentary pointed out that the leaders of the US Navy are particularly enthusiastic about the arms race. According to the 1960-1961 shipbuilding plan, the United States has now begun constructing fourteen warships and is continuing to build seven to eight warships. However, Chief of Naval Operations Burke also demanded the construction of more warships. The American arms industry fully supports this plan.

Xinhua News Agency, January 6th: Sydney News: Some Australian trade union organizations protested against the US decision to resume nuclear testing and demanded that the Australian Council of Trade Unions lodge a strong protest against the US decision.

The Australian Communist Party's newspaper "Tribune" Weekly today reprinted the protests made by the leaders of these trade unions. Perth, the Federal Secretary of the Australian Building Workers' Industrial Union, said that the US decision made people in all countries uneasy. Perth pointed out that the US imperialism made this decision on the eve of the summit conference and when the prospects for peace were much brighter, which shows what the goals of US imperialism are.

Anderson, the secretary of the Painters' Union, said that the United States must not be allowed to arbitrarily despise the interests of the people of all countries, and every effort must be made to stop the United States from carrying out nuclear tests.

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, January 6th: The Argentine Peace Committee issued a statement exposing the United States' attempt to impose a "continental policy" plan on the Latin American people under the guise of supporting disarmament in Latin America, making itself the sole seller of arms, and expanding military base facilities, including the storage of nuclear weapons.

The statement pointed out that the United States, while ostensibly supporting the Latin American disarmament proposal, has in fact sold destroyers, submarines, and aircraft to Brazil and Argentina in the past few days. The statement said that when the United Nations is studying comprehensive disarmament proposals, such intentions of the State Department cannot be agreed to.

    苏联报刊发表评论指出
    美国有人竭力制造冷战气氛
    澳大利亚工会组织抗议美国要恢复核试验的决定
    新华社莫斯科6日电　最新一期苏联“新时代”杂志发表文章说，美国借口日内瓦会议不会成功而拒绝停止核爆炸，这种作法是毫无根据的。文章指出，如果有什么东西会使日内瓦不继续核武器试验会议的前途严重恶化的话，那么这就是美国政府的这一决定。
    文章说，西方的报纸指出，美国政府的决定是由美国这样一些人作出的，这些人想继续核试验，因为他们认为，继续核试验是阻碍国际局势缓和、制造冷战气氛、回到实力地位政策的办法。
    文章还指出，美国原子能委员会和五角大楼早就企图恢复核试验，企图阻挠日内瓦会议的工作。
    新华社莫斯科6日电　“苏联海军报”今天发表评论，谴责美国继续进行军备竞赛。
    评论提醒人们注意美国一些反对改善国际局势的人的姿态和诡计。
    评论说，在华盛顿，还有不少这样的人，他们宣传所谓“明天的战略”，宣传在“有限战争”中运用原子武器。
    评论指出，美国各种集团目前正围绕着军事开支进行斗争。这些集团一致要求增加军事拨款，五角大楼认为，像去年一样拨出四百亿美元的军事预算，不够满足“坚决转到火箭和核子时代”的需要。
    评论指出，美国海军的领袖们特别热心于军备竞赛。根据1960—1961年的造舰计划，美国现在已开始建造十四艘军舰，继续建造七艘到八艘军舰。但是，海军作战参谋长伯克还要求建造更多的军舰。美国军火工业完全支持这种计划。
    新华社6日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚一些工会组织抗议美国恢复核试验的决定，并且要求澳大利亚工会理事会对美国的这个决定提出强硬的抗议。
    澳大利亚共产党机关报“论坛”周报今天转载了这些工会的负责人提出的抗议。澳大利亚建筑工人产业工会联邦书记珀斯说，美国的这个决定使各国人民惶惶不安。珀斯指出，美国帝国主义在最高级会议前夕、和平的前景更加光明得多的时候作出这个决定，这就表明了美国帝国主义的目标是什么。
    油漆工人工会书记安德逊说，决不容许美国随意蔑视世界各国人民的利益，必须尽一切力量来阻止美国实行核试验。
    据新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯6日电　阿根廷和平委员会发表声明，揭露美国在支持拉丁美洲裁军的幌子下企图把一项“洲际政策”的方案强加于拉丁美洲人民，使自己成为军备的唯一出售者，并且扩大军事基地的设施，包括储存核武器在内。
  声明指出，美国表面上支持拉丁美洲的裁军建议，实际上却在过去几天内把驱逐舰、潜水艇和飞机卖给巴西和阿根廷。声明说，当联合国在研究全面裁军建议的时候，国务院的这种意图是不能同意的。
