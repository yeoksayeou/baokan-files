The midnight tricycle

　　Hu Zhuzhai, a salesman at the Lianghu Retail Store in Wuhan, finished his busy day, settling the accounts and tidying up the goods. It was already eleven o'clock. He had just fallen asleep when he suddenly heard a frantic knocking on the door. Who would be knocking on the door to buy something so late at night? Just as he was about to get up to open the door, the female salesperson, Xiao Ronghua, had already gotten out of bed and opened it. He listened carefully to the commotion outside: the person knocking was a woman from the neighborhood, anxiously explaining that her mother had suddenly fallen ill with a terrible stomachache. It was too late to hire a cart, and after thinking about it, she had no choice but to borrow the store's tricycle to take her mother to the hospital. Xiao Ronghua pulled the tricycle out and handed it to the woman, closed the door, and went back to sleep.

　　At this moment, Hu Zhuzhai heard the slow sound of the tricycle outside. He thought: the hospital is a good seven or eight *li* away from here, how difficult it must be for a woman to pull a sick person such a long distance in the middle of the night! Thinking about it, he suddenly sat up, threw on his clothes, and ran outside. Just then, the woman was pulling the tricycle uphill with great difficulty. Seeing him rushing over to take the cart and offer to take her mother to the hospital, she thanked him repeatedly.

　　He took the mother and daughter to the Fifth Hospital in Hanyang, waited for the doctor to examine the patient and say that it was an intestinal inflammation requiring hospitalization and surgery, before turning back. As he was leaving, the old woman pressed two *yuan* into his hand, insisting that he accept it, but he smiled and said, "I can't accept this, it's what we should do."

　　Hu Zhuzhai pedaled the empty tricycle back to Yingwuzhou lightly. When he was almost back to the store, he came across an old woman looking around anxiously on the road. He thought that the old woman must be in some kind of trouble, so he stopped the cart and asked her. She said that she had come to Hanyang West Street to find her nephew but couldn't find him no matter what. Hu Zhuzhai said, "West Street is seven or eight *li* from here, come on, get in the cart, I'll take you there." By the time he had taken the old woman there, helped her find her nephew, and returned to the store, it was already past four o'clock in the morning.

    半夜的三轮车
    张碨
    武汉市两湖零售商店的营业员胡竹斋，忙了一天，把账、货清理停当后，时间已是十一点了。他刚睡下不久，忽然听得一阵紧似一阵的敲门声。夜这样深了，谁来敲门买东西呢？他正要起来开门，女营业员萧荣华已经起床把门打开了。他仔细地听着外面的动静：敲门的是附近的一个妇女，她焦急地诉说自己的母亲发了急病，肚疼的要命，天太晚了雇不到车，想来想去只好来借商店的三轮车，自己把母亲送到医院去。萧荣华把车子拉出来交给那个妇女，关上门，又睡去了。
    这时，胡竹斋听到了门外传来那三轮车的缓慢的响声。他想：医院离这里足有七、八里地，一个妇女在这深夜里，拉一个病人走远路，该有多么艰难哪！想着想着，他猛然坐起来，披上衣服就往外边跑。这当儿，那个妇女正拉着三轮上坡，很吃力，见他赶来抢过车子，要替她送母亲上医院，便连声道谢。
    他送这母女两人到了设在汉阳的第五医院，等着医生检查了病人，说是肠子发炎要住院动手术后，才转回去。临走时，老妈妈塞给他两块钱，一定要他收下，他笑着说：“我是不收的，这是我们应该做的事。”
    胡竹斋轻快地踩着空车回鹦鹉洲去。快到商店的时候，他又碰到一个老太婆在大路上东张西望的。他想，这老人一定有什么事情，便停住车问她。她说她来汉阳西大街找外甥，怎样也找不到。胡竹斋说：“西大街离这儿七、八里路，来，上车吧，我送你去。”等他把老太婆送去，替她找到她的外甥，又回到商店来的时候，已经到了早上四点多钟了。
