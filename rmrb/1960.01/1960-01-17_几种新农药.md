Several new pesticides
Several new pesticides researched and tested by the Jiangsu Provincial Pesticide Research Institute

Dinitrothiocyanobenzene: An organic fungicide, commonly known as Dinitrosan.

In the past, there was no way to control wheat scab and rust, often causing severe yield reductions. With Dinitrosan, there is a guarantee for controlling the main diseases of wheat. It can also control grape downy mildew, powdery mildew, apple scab, black spot and potato late blight.

Pentachloronitrobenzene: An organic soil fungicide, very effective in controlling soil-borne diseases.

Anthracnose and Rhizoctonia solani are two major diseases in the cotton seedling stage, often causing missing seedlings and affecting high yields. Now, a mixture of pentachloronitrobenzene and Ceresan can be used for thorough control.

This drug has a very good control effect on wheat bunt and flag smut, and rice sheath blight.

Barium Polysulfide: An inorganic fungicide and miticide that can replace lime sulfur mixture to control many diseases, and can also control red spiders, wheat rust, apple and pear black spot, grape and cucumber powdery mildew, peanut and tomato brown spot, and can control scale insects and insect eggs on winter fruit trees and other pests.

Ethyl Parathion: A new organic phosphorus insecticide, which is less toxic to humans and animals. Diluted ethyl parathion emulsion is very effective in controlling vegetable aphids, cabbage caterpillars, wheat aphids, bean aphids, rice borers, peach green leafhoppers, etc.

Emulsifier Phosphorus Link No. 9: Many pesticides, especially organophosphorus insecticides such as 1605 and 1059, are mostly processed into emulsions for application, so emulsifiers must be used. The quality of the emulsifier directly affects the quality and effect of the insecticide. In recent years, the organophosphorus agent 1605 has begun to be produced in my country, and other new organophosphorus agents are constantly emerging. Therefore, advanced emulsifiers must be used in conjunction to exert their due effect.

Emulsifier Phosphorus Link No. 9 is an emulsifier suitable for organophosphorus insecticides. Its chemical name is polyoxyethylene glycol diphenyl ether, and its appearance is a brownish-yellow oily liquid. Emulsifier Phosphorus Link No. 9 has good emulsifying properties for organophosphorus insecticides such as 1059, methyl 1059, M-81, 3911, malathion and ethyl malathion. It is now being expanded for trial production. In the future, organizing production will play a major role in promoting the development of organophosphorus agents.

    几种新农药
    江苏省农药试验研究所试验研究的几种新农药
  二硝基硫氢代苯　是一种有机杀菌剂，通用名称叫二硝散。
    过去小麦的赤霉病和锈病没有办法防治，常常造成严重的减产。有了二硝散在防治三麦的主要病害上就有了保证。它还可以防治葡萄霜霉病，白粉病，苹果疮痂病、黑星病及马铃薯晚疫病。
    五氯硝基苯　是一种有机的土壤杀菌剂，对防治土壤传染的病害很有效。
    炭疽病和立枯病，是棉花苗期的两种主要病害，常常引起棉花缺苗，影响丰产。现在可以用五氯硝基苯和西力生的混合药剂来彻底防治。
    这种药对于小麦腥黑穗和秆黑穗水稻纹枯病都有很好的防治效果。
    多硫化钡　它是一种无机杀菌剂和杀螨剂，可以代替石灰硫黄合剂防治许多种病害，还可以防治红蜘蛛、三麦锈病，防治苹果和梨的黑星病、葡萄与黄瓜的白粉病、花生和蕃茄的褐斑病，并能防治冬季果树上的介壳虫和虫卵等其他病虫害。
    乙基马拉松　是一种新的有机磷杀虫剂，对人畜的毒性比较小。用兑水的乙基马拉松乳剂对除治菜蚜、菜青虫、麦蚜、豆蚜、水稻螟虫、桃绿浮尘子等都很有效。
    磷联九号乳化剂　有许多种农药，特别是像一六○五、一○五九等有机磷杀虫药剂多是加工成乳剂应用，因此都必须用乳化剂，乳化剂的好坏直接影响到杀虫药剂的质量和效果。近几年来，有机磷剂一六○五已在我国开始生产，其他新的有机磷剂也在不断出现，因此必须有高级的乳化剂配合才能发挥它们应有的作用。
    磷联九号乳化剂是一种适用于有机磷杀虫药剂的乳化剂，化学名称为多聚氧化乙烯乙二醇对联苯酚醚，外观为棕褐色油状液体。磷联九号乳化剂对于一○五九、甲基一○五九、M—八一、三九一一、马拉松及乙基马拉松等有机磷杀虫剂都有良好的乳化性能，现在正在扩大试制中，今后组织生产后，对有机磷剂的发展将起重大的推动作用。
