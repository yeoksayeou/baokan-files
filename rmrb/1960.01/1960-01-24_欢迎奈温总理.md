　　Burmese Federal Prime Minister Ne Win is coming to China for a friendly visit at the invitation of our Premier Zhou Enlai, and will arrive in Beijing today. Prime Minister Ne Win brings us the sincere friendship of the Burmese people, and our people extend a warm welcome to his arrival and the distinguished guests accompanying him.
　　There is a long history of friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Burma. Although this friendly exchange was once blocked by imperialism, the oppression of imperialism and colonialism brought our two peoples to a common fate, and we further strengthened our close friendship in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for our respective national independence. The late Burmese national leader General Aung San once said in his congratulatory message to the "New Rangoon Daily" on August 2, 1946: "We need a united, strong, and democratic new China, and we hope that her lost sovereignty will be fully restored. This is not only beneficial to China and to us, but also to the entire Asia." General Aung San's words fully expressed the deep feelings of the Burmese people towards the Chinese people. Similarly, the Chinese people sincerely wish our neighbor Burma to embark on the road of independence and prosperity.
　　The establishment of the Union of Burma in 1948 and the birth of the People's Republic of China in 1949 opened a new era of friendly relations between China and Burma. Since the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Burma in June 1950, for ten years, representatives of the two governments and peoples have traveled back and forth between Beijing and Rangoon in an endless stream. During these years, leaders of the Chinese and Burmese governments have paid friendly visits to each other. Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and Marshal Ye Jianying have successively visited Burma; while former Burmese Prime Ministers U Nu, U Ba Swe, Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein, and Speaker Sao Hkun Hkio have also visited our country as guests. In particular, when our Premier Zhou Enlai visited Burma in June 1954, the prime ministers of the two countries issued a joint statement, which established the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence guiding Sino-Burmese relations, which further developed the relations between our two countries. In recent years, China and Burma have also continuously expanded friendly cooperation and exchanges in the economic and cultural fields.
　　The Chinese people are pleased to see that since Prime Minister Ne Win's cabinet took office, China and Burma have continued to develop friendly relations. In the past year, our people have successively welcomed the Burmese Art Inspection Group and the cultural delegation headed by Burmese Minister of Culture U Chit Thoung, while our border defense friendly delegation, cooperative delegation, and male and female gymnastics teams have also visited Burma. Chinese painting exhibitions and Burmese Bagan mural exhibitions were held in the capitals of the two countries respectively. In particular, when the Chinese people celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Burmese Minister of Culture U Chit Thoung, on behalf of the Government of the Union of Burma, brought the warm congratulations of the Burmese people to our people. Burmese Federal Prime Minister Ne Win mentioned the constantly developing Sino-Burmese friendship in his congratulatory telegram to our Premier Zhou Enlai, saying: "The people and government of the Union of Burma also earnestly hope to further enhance and consolidate this friendship, so that the people of our two countries can live together forever in peace and good-neighborly understanding." The Chinese government and people highly cherish the warm and friendly wishes mentioned by Prime Minister Ne Win in the above-mentioned congratulatory telegram.
　　Our government and people have always believed that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly initiated by the governments of China and Burma and the spirit of the Bandung Conference have great historical significance in guiding international relations. In handling affairs between China and Burma, our government has always strictly followed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference. As our Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Yi recently pointed out, "Burma is our closest neighbor and a relative country. Historically, we have not had major disputes. We can completely adopt the principles of the Bandung Conference to solve problems between the two countries and to consolidate and develop the friendship between our two countries." We warmly hope that Prime Minister Ne Win's visit to our country will definitely help to further strengthen Sino-Burmese relations. The Chinese people firmly believe that the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma will flow forward forever like the Nu River (Salween River) and the Irrawaddy River, which simultaneously irrigate the lands of our two countries.

    欢迎奈温总理
    缅甸联邦奈温总理应我国周恩来总理的邀请，前来我国进行友好的访问，将在今天到达北京。奈温总理给我们带来了缅甸人民的亲切友谊，我国人民对他的莅临和陪同他前来的贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。
    中缅两国人民之间存在着友好交往的悠久历史。这种友好交往虽然一度为帝国主义所阻断，但是帝国主义和殖民主义的压迫使我们两国人民遭遇到了共同的命运，我们在反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取各自的民族独立的共同斗争中，更加增进了我们之间的亲密友谊。缅甸已故的民族领袖昂山将军曾经在1946年8月2日致“新仰光日报”的祝词中说过：“我们需要一个团结、强大、民主的新中国，愿她已经丧失的主权完全恢复，这不仅对中国有利，对我们有利，而且也对整个亚洲有利。”昂山将军的话充分地表达了缅甸人民对中国人民的深厚感情。同样，中国人民也衷心地祝愿我们的邻邦缅甸走上独立和繁荣的道路。
    1948年缅甸联邦的成立和1949年中华人民共和国的诞生，开辟了中缅两国之间友好关系的新纪元。自从1950年6月，中缅两国正式建交以来，十年于兹，两国政府和人民的代表往返于北京和仰光之间，络绎不绝。这些年中，中缅两国政府领导人互相进行了友好访问，我国前全国人民代表大会常务委员会宋庆龄副委员长、周恩来总理、贺龙副总理、叶剑英元帅等先后访问缅甸；而缅甸前总理吴努、吴巴瑞、副总理吴觉迎、议长萧恢塔也曾先后到我国来作客。特别是1954年6月，我国周恩来总理访问缅甸时，两国总理发表了联合声明，确定了指导中缅关系的和平共处五项原则，这就更进一步发展了我们两国之间的关系。这些年来，在经济和文化上，中缅两国也不断扩大了友好的合作和交流。
    中国人民高兴地看到，自从奈温总理的内阁执政以来，中缅两国继续发展着友好关系。在过去的一年中，我国人民又先后迎接了缅甸艺术考察团和以缅甸文化部部长吴漆东为首的文化代表团，而我国的边防军友好代表团、合作社代表团和男、女体操队也到缅甸进行了访问。在两国首都分别举行了中国画展览会和缅甸蒲甘壁画展览。特别是当中国人民欢庆中华人民共和国国庆十周年的时候，缅甸文化部部长吴漆东代表缅甸联邦政府给我国人民带来了缅甸人民的热情的祝贺。缅甸联邦奈温总理在致我国周恩来总理的贺电中提到不断发展的中缅友谊时说：“缅甸联邦的人民和政府还殷切地希望进一步增进和巩固这种友谊，而使我们两国人民可以永远一起生活在和平和睦邻的谅解中”。中国政府和人民十分珍视奈温总理在上述贺电中所提到的热烈的、友好的愿望。
    我国政府和人民一向认为，中缅两国政府所共同创议的和平共处五项原则和万隆会议的精神对于指导国际关系具有重大的历史意义。在处理中缅两国之间的事务的时候，我国政府也一贯严格地遵循和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议的精神。正如我国陈毅副总理兼外交部长最近所指出的，“缅甸是我们最近的邻邦，是亲戚国家，在历史上我们之间没有发生重大的争执，我们完全可以采取万隆会议的原则来解决两国之间的问题，来巩固和发展我们两国之间的友谊。”我们热烈地希望，奈温总理的这次访问我国必将有助于中缅两国关系的进一步加强。中国人民深信，中缅两国人民的友谊将像同时灌溉着我们两国国土的怒江（萨尔温江）和伊洛瓦底江一样永远向前奔流。
