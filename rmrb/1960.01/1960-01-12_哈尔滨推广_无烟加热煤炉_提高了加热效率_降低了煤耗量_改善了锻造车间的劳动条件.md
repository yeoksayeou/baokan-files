    Harbin Promotes "Smokeless Heating Coal Stoves"
    Improved Heating Efficiency, Reduced Coal Consumption, and Improved Labor Conditions in Forging Workshops
    (Our report) Harbin City recently promoted a type of "smokeless heating coal stove" that can be widely used in forging workshops. The main differences between this "smokeless heating coal stove" and the old heating stoves are threefold: First, the chimney is thickened and heightened, increasing the draft; second, the smoke exhaust port and flue are enlarged, reducing smoke exhaust resistance; and third, the smoke storage chamber is enlarged, giving the smoke room to circulate. The use of this "smokeless heating coal stove" in many factories such as Harbin Longjiang Electric Factory and Harbin Bearing Factory has proven that this reform fundamentally improves the smoky labor conditions in forging workshops that generally use solid coal as fuel because the heating stove no longer emits large amounts of smoke into the workshop during forging.
    This "smokeless heating coal stove" was suggested for renovation by Wang Jishun, a technician at the Pressure Processing Laboratory of Harbin Institute of Technology. When he put forward this suggestion, some people thought that after the chimney was heightened and the draft increased, the air pressure at the bottom of the furnace would be lower than outside the furnace, which would cause cold air to flow into the furnace, reduce heating efficiency, and affect the quality of forgings. With the enthusiastic support of the school's Party organization, Wang Jishun and other veteran workers boldly renovated a heating stove in the laboratory. After trial firing, it proved that not only did the heating stove no longer emit smoke into the workshop, but also the heating efficiency was increased by nearly 100 percent, and coal consumption was reduced by 30 percent. Recently, the Pressure Processing Teaching and Research Section of this school made a theoretical explanation of Wang Jishun's suggestion through a large number of experiments: Although the furnace bottom pressure of the "smokeless heating coal stove" is lower than that outside the furnace to a certain extent, it does not affect the quality of forgings. Because this type of furnace mainly relies on natural ventilation in the flue, which can more fully utilize the fuel and increase the furnace temperature than the old furnace, which mainly relies on a large-capacity blower to assist combustion, in order to offset the cold air flowing into the furnace. In addition, methods such as installing movable gates in the flue and closing the furnace door tightly can also be used to appropriately control the inflow of cold air. (Attached picture)

    哈尔滨推广“无烟加热煤炉”
    提高了加热效率　降低了煤耗量　改善了锻造车间的劳动条件
    本报讯　哈尔滨市最近推广了一种可以在锻造车间普遍采用的“无烟加热煤炉”。这种“无烟加热煤炉”同旧加热炉的不同处主要有三点：一、加粗、加高烟囱，增加了抽烟力；二、加大排烟口及烟道，减少了出烟阻力；三、加大储烟室，使烟有回旋余地。哈尔滨龙江电工厂、哈尔滨轴承厂等许多工厂使用这种“无烟加热煤炉”的情况证明，这一改革使加热炉在锻造时不再大量向车间冒烟，因而从根本上改善了一般以固体煤为燃料的锻造车间烟熏火燎的劳动条件。
    这种“无烟加热煤炉”是哈尔滨工业大学压力加工实验室技工王继顺建议改建的。当他提出这一建议时，曾经有人认为，烟囱加高，抽烟力加大以后，炉底的气压小于炉外，会使冷空气流入炉内降低加热效率，影响锻件质量。王继顺和其他老工人在学校党组织的热情支持下，大胆改建了实验室的一座加热炉，经过试烧证明，不仅加热炉不再往车间冒烟，而且加热效率提高了将近一倍，煤耗量也降低了30％。最近，这个学校压力加工教研室通过大量实验，对王继顺的建议做出了理论上的说明：“无烟加热煤炉”的炉底压力虽在一定程度上低于炉外，但是并不影响锻件质量。因为这种炉子主要依靠烟道自然通风，比旧炉主要依靠大容量鼓风机助燃更能充分发挥燃料的功能，提高炉内温度，用以抵消流入炉内的冷空气。另外，还可以用在烟道中装活的闸门，以及关紧炉门等办法，来适当控制冷空气流入。（附图片）
