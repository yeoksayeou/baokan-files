    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 19th. Anhui Province's industrial production has achieved a flying start and is red every day since the beginning of this year. Only half of January has passed, and a batch of factories in the province have already completed their entire monthly production plans ahead of schedule.
    In Bengbu City, the Metal Manufacturing Factory, Mingguang Latex Factory, Automobile Repair Factory, Monosodium Glutamate Factory, Pharmaceutical Factory, and the street factories in the Middle School District, used only five to fourteen days to complete their January production plans ahead of schedule. In Wuhu City, as of January 15th, six factories, including Hongda Power Machinery Factory, Boiler Factory, Standard Instrument Factory, and Scissors Factory, had completed their January output value plans ahead of schedule, exceeding them by 1.13% to 50% respectively. Hefei City's Electric Motor Factory completed its January output value plan nineteen days ahead of schedule, exceeding it by 7.35%. Three light industrial factories in Shucheng County completed their January production plans ahead of schedule, using one-third of January's time.
    The main reasons for this batch of factories to complete their production plans ahead of schedule are early preparation and vigorous technical innovation. The leaders of these factories had already conveyed the January production plans to workshops, teams, and individuals in mid-December of last year, and had made preparations for equipment additions, inspections, and raw material procurement in advance. On this basis, the factories also tightly grasped the key to production, mobilized workers to vigorously engage in technical innovation, and implemented innovations as soon as they were made, greatly improving labor productivity. For example, Hefei Machine Tool Factory realized 154 technical innovation projects in the twelve days of January, increasing work efficiency by one to fifty times respectively, which played a major role in completing the January output value plan ahead of schedule.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 17th. As of the 12th, forty-six factories under the jurisdiction of Xining City's industrial and handicraft industries had completed their January production plans ahead of schedule.
    
    From the 1st to the 12th, the total output value of the city's industrial and handicraft industries increased by 23.2% compared with the same period in December last year. The factories also successfully trial-produced more than 390 products, including ephedrine, glass products, artificial leather, and three-share plows. The workers of Xining Pharmaceutical Factory overcame technical equipment difficulties in the first five days of January and successfully trial-produced an effective drug for treating bronchitis, asthma, and other diseases - ephedrine hydrochloride, which was found to be of good quality after testing.
    
    At the beginning of the new year, the Xining Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China paid close attention to using the work method of "grasping both ends and bringing along the middle," planting red flags, establishing pacesetters, and leading the workers of all factories in the city to continue to leap forward, which played a decisive role in ensuring the completion of the plan ahead of schedule.

### 安徽一批工厂跨进二月份  西宁四十六个工厂传喜报

    安徽一批工厂跨进二月份
    西宁四十六个工厂传喜报
    本报合肥19日电　安徽省工业生产今年一开始就作到了开门红、日日红。1月份刚过去一半，全省就有一批工厂提前完成全月生产计划。
    蚌埠市的金属制造厂、明光乳胶厂、汽车修理厂、味精厂、制药厂及中师区的街道工厂，只用了五天到十四天的时间，分别提前完成了1月份的生产计划。芜湖市到1月15日止，有宏大动力机械厂、锅炉厂、标准仪表厂、剪刀厂等六个工厂，分别超额1．13％到50％提前完成1月份产值计划。合肥市电机厂提前十九天超额7．35％完成了1月份产值计划。舒城县三个轻工业工厂都是用1月份三分之一的时间，提前完成了1月份生产计划。
    这一批工厂提前完成生产计划的主要原因是准备工作抓得早和大闹技术革新。这些工厂的领导早在去年12月中旬就把元月份的生产计划下达到车间、小组和个人，并提前作好了设备添置、检查和原材料筹集等准备工作。在此基础上，各厂又紧紧抓住生产关键，发动职工大闹技术革新，并作到革新一件，推广一件。大大提高了劳动生产率。如合肥机床厂在1月份的十二天中，就实现了技术革新项目一百五十四项，分别提高工效一倍到五十倍，对提前完成1月份的产值计划起了重大作用。
    据新华社西宁17日电　到12日止，西宁市所属的工业和手工业工厂中，已有四十六个厂提前完成了1月份生产计划。
    从1日到12日，全市市属工业、手工业的生产总值，比去年12月同期增长23．2％。各厂还试制成功麻黄素、玻璃制品、人造皮革、三铧犁等三百九十多种产品。西宁制药厂的职工，在1月份的前五天中，克服技术设备上的困难，试制成功治疗气管炎、气喘等病症的特效药——盐酸麻黄素，经过化验，质量良好。
    中共西宁市委新年一开始就十分注意运用“抓两头、带中间”的工作方法，插红旗，树标兵，领导全市各工厂职工继续跃进，对保证提前完成计划，起了决定性作用。
