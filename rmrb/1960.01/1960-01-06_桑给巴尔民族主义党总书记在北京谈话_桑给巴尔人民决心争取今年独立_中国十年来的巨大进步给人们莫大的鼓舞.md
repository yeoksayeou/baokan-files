Xinhua News Agency, January 5th: Abdul Rahman Muhammad, Secretary-General of the Zanzibar Nationalist Party, who is currently visiting China, told Xinhua reporters today that the people of Zanzibar, like the people of all countries in East Africa, are determined to strive for independence in 1960. He said: "The possibility of achieving independence is very high because this has become the demand of the entire people. For seventy years under British imperialist rule, our people have suffered exploitation, oppression, and poverty."

This guest from the coast of the Indian Ocean in East Africa said: "Our struggle has entered a historically significant stage. What we want is political and economic independence. We want to raise the living standards of the people."

He said that the struggle of the people of Zanzibar is linked to the struggle of the entire East African region. Since September 1958, the "Central Africa East Africa Pan-African Freedom Movement" has been launched in the East African region. All political parties in Central and East Africa have participated in this movement, and one of its purposes is to enable these regions to achieve independence in 1960. The Zanzibar Nationalist Party has passed a resolution for this purpose and declared that if independence cannot be achieved in 1960, effective measures will be taken. This is the first public action announced by our people, reflecting their hatred of imperialism.

Mr. Muhammad reviewed the brutal oppression and exploitation of Zanzibar by British imperialism for seventy years. Britain controls all of Zanzibar's import and export trade.

Muhammad said that for seventy years, in order to maintain its "divide and rule" policy, British imperialism has divided the people of Zanzibar into many tribes, but the people of Zanzibar are now determined to take their destiny into their own hands. He pointed out that the unity of the people in Zanzibar makes imperialism very afraid, and imperialism has even taken direct means of suppression. However, this can only promote greater unity among the people.

Muhammad pointed out that at present, U.S. imperialism is making every effort to invade East Africa in two ways. On the one hand, it infiltrates these countries through its lackeys in some trade unions in East African countries; on the other hand, it tries to introduce more U.S. investment. In Central Africa, two-thirds of the national income is currently taken away by large amounts of investment from the United States and Britain, especially the United States, which is a lesson to be learned.

Mr. Muhammad said when talking about his impressions of visiting China: "The situation in China has deeply moved me. What impresses me most is that the Chinese people have truly taken control of their own destiny and become the masters of history, while at the same time creating their own beautiful future life according to their own wishes.

He said: "I have seen how a country that was once deeply oppressed and exploited by imperialism has made tremendous progress in just ten short years. This cannot but bring great encouragement to people, especially to people from countries like Zanzibar, because we often hear that living standards can only be improved with Western aid. However, in the face of the great victory of the Chinese people, we deeply realize how absurd this statement is!"

Mr. Muhammad said: "I will return to Zanzibar and East Africa with great hope. I will tell the people everything I have seen in China; I will tell them that the example of China shows that we can create a happy and prosperous future with our own hands."

    桑给巴尔民族主义党总书记在北京谈话
    桑给巴尔人民决心争取今年独立
    中国十年来的巨大进步给人们莫大的鼓舞
    据新华社5日讯　正在我国访问的桑给巴尔民族主义党总书记阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·穆罕默德今天对新华社记者说，桑给巴尔人民同东非地区所有国家的人民一样，决心要在1960年争取独立。他说：“取得独立的可能性很大，因为这已经成为全民的要求。在英帝国主义统治下七十年来，我们的人民受尽了剥削、压迫和贫困。”
    这位来自东非印度洋岸的客人说：“我们的斗争已经进入具有历史意义的阶段。我们要的是政治上和经济上的独立。我们要提高人民的生活水平。”
    他说，桑给巴尔人民的斗争，是同整个东非地区的斗争联系在一起的。从1958年9月起，在东非地区就开展了“中非东非泛非自由运动”，所有中非和东非的政党都参加了这个运动，它的目的之一就是要使这些地区在1960年获得独立。桑给巴尔民族主义党曾经为此通过一项决议，并且宣布如果1960年还不能取得独立，就要采取有效的措施。这是我国人民第一次宣布的公开行动，这反映了他们对帝国主义的憎恨。
    穆罕默德先生回顾了英帝国主义七十年来对桑给巴尔的残酷压迫和剥削。英国控制了桑给巴尔全部进口和出口贸易。
    穆罕默德说，七十年来，英帝国主义为了保持其“分而治之”的政策，把桑给巴尔的人民划分为许多部落，但是桑给巴尔人民今天已经下定决心要把自己的命运掌握在自己手里。他指出，桑给巴尔国内人民的团结使帝国主义十分害怕，帝国主义甚至采取了直接镇压的手段。但是，这只能促使人民更加团结。
    穆罕默德指出，目前美帝国主义正在从两方面竭力侵入东非。一方面通过他们在东非国家一些工会里的走狗来渗入这些国家；另一方面设法引进更多的美国投资。而在中非，目前国民收入的三分之二都被美国和英国，特别是美国的大量投资所夺走，这是前车之鉴。
    穆罕默德先生谈到访问中国的观感时说：“中国的情况使我深为感动。使我最感突出的是中国人民真正掌握了自己的命运，成为历史的主人，同时又在根据自己的愿望创造自己未来的美好生活。
    他说：“我看到了一个曾经饱受帝国主义压迫和剥削的国家在短短的十年内如何取得了巨大的进步，这不能不给人们，特别是对来自像桑给巴尔这样的国家的人们带来莫大的鼓舞，因为我们常听说只有靠西方援助才能提高生活水平。但是，我们在中国人民伟大的胜利面前，深深地体会到这种说法是何等荒谬！”。
    穆罕默德先生说：“我将怀着极大的希望回到桑给巴尔和东非。我要把我在中国所看到的一切告诉人民；我要告诉他们，中国的例子说明，我们是可以通过自己的双手创造出美满的、幸福的未来。”
