Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 18th. An article published in the January 15th edition of "Laos Patriotic News" entitled "The Lao People Are Watching the Words and Deeds of the Kou Abhay Government" stated that if Kou Abhay, the Prime Minister of the Lao "Provisional Government," sincerely hopes that the situation in Laos will stabilize so that the people can live and work in peace, then the government he leads must first and foremost immediately stop the brutal civil war provoked single-handedly by the lackeys of U.S. imperialism, and immediately withdraw the Lao Royal Army, which is carrying out "sweeping" operations and killing the people everywhere.

The article pointed out that in order to show sincerity in respecting the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and in respecting the democratic and free rights of Laos, the Kou Abhay government must agree to restore the activities of the International Commission for Laos and immediately restore the freedom of the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and other cadres and all patriots who are being illegally imprisoned.

The article said that if Kou Abhay truly cares about national harmony, then he must hold peaceful negotiations with the Lao Patriotic Front on the basis of the agreements that have been signed in the past, in order to promote the normalization of the situation in Laos and conduct general elections on a rational and democratic basis.

The article pointed out that in order to achieve peaceful neutrality, it is first necessary to stop U.S. imperialist interference in Laos, stop colluding with the reactionary authorities of certain vassal states of U.S. imperialism in Southeast Asia, abandon the policy of following U.S. imperialism and being hostile to neighboring countries, and create conditions for establishing diplomatic relations with countries that wish to establish friendly relations with Laos on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

The article concluded by saying that the Lao people are watching the actions of the Kou Abhay government and will evaluate this government based on its actual actions. The Lao people will support those who sincerely strive for a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 19th. According to a report in the "Laos Patriotic News" on January 12th, all commanders and fighters of the Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Forces held a meeting on January 8th, strongly condemning the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" warlord chiefs' conspiracy to dissolve the National Assembly and expand the civil war, and condemning their crimes of conducting large-scale "sweeping" operations in areas such as Nam Na and Muong Nau in Phongsaly Province, Muang Bo in Sam Neua Province, and Nam Ngun in Khammouane Province.

The conference passed a resolution demanding that the Lao Provisional Government restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front; and demanding that the Lao Provisional Government hold consultations with the Lao Fighting Forces to jointly conduct general elections.

According to reports, from January 2nd to 9th, more than 6,200 people in Xieng Khouang, Sam Neua, and Vientiane signed their names in opposition to the Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" warlord chiefs who were running rampant in Laos.

    老挝临时政府必须停止内战
    人民将对库·阿贝政府的实际行动作出评价
    寮国战斗部队第二营集会谴责军阀头目扩大内战
    新华社河内18日电　1月15日出版的“老挝爱国新闻”发表的一篇题为“老挝人民正在注视着库·阿贝政府的言行”的文章说，老挝“临时政府”首相库·阿贝如果真诚希望老挝局势安定下来，以便让老百姓能够安居乐业的话，他所领导的政府首先必须马上停止由美帝国主义的走狗一手挑起的残酷的内战，马上撤走正在到处进行“扫荡”、杀害老百姓的老挝王国军队。
    文章指出，为了表示尊重日内瓦协议和万象协议，尊重老挝的民主自由权利的诚意，库·阿贝政府必须同意恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，立即恢复正被非法监禁的老挝爱国战线党领导人和其他干部以及所有爱国者的自由。
    文章说，如果库·阿贝真正关心民族和睦的话，那么，他必须在曾经签定的协议的基础上，同老挝爱国战线党举行和平谈判，以促使老挝局势正常化，在合理、民主的基础上进行普选。
    文章指出，为了实现和平中立，首先必须制止美帝国主义对老挝的干涉，停止同美帝国主义在东南亚的某些仆从国家的反动当局互相勾结，放弃追随美帝国主义、以邻国为敌的政策，为同希望在和平共处五项原则的基础上与老挝建立友好关系的国家建立外交关系创造条件。
    文章最后说，老挝人民正在注视着库·阿贝政府的行动，他们将视它的实际行动来评价这个政府。老挝人民将会支持真心诚意地为和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝而奋斗的人。
    新华社河内19日电　据“老挝爱国新闻”12日报道，寮国战斗部队第二营全体指战员在1月8日集会，严厉谴责老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的军阀头目们解散国会、扩大内战的阴谋，并谴责他们在丰沙里省的南那、夺瑙、桑怒省的芒波和甘蒙省的南垠等地区进行大规模的“扫荡”的罪行。
    大会通过决议，要求老挝临时政府恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由；要求老挝临时政府同寮国战斗部队举行协商，共同进行普选。
    据报道，从1960年1月2日到9日，在川圹、桑怒和万象有六千二百多人签名反对在老挝横行霸道的老挝“保卫国家利益委员会”的军阀头目们。
