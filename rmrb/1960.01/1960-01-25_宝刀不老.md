    Old Sword Still Sharp
    Li Na
    I arrived at Sihu Mountain in Wuhu, and after winding past many neatly arranged small blast furnaces, I found the room of Master Craftsman Shen Yuting on a hillside in a red brick house. I pushed open the door, and the room was quiet. The stove was burning brightly, and half a bowl of noodles on the table was still steaming. One chopstick had fallen into the stove and was already half burned. The host must be very busy. I waited for a long time before hearing footsteps. Then a tall, straight figure with a full head of white hair that highlighted a radiant face entered. As soon as he came in, without asking who was standing there to greet him, he said loudly, "The wire's broken!" He offered me his large hand: "The wire's broken." He wiped the sweat from his forehead and listened for a while before nodding in satisfaction. Someone told me that he was a little deaf, but even in his dreams, he could distinguish the sound of the blower.
    Master Shen, sixty-six years old, is a retired worker from Benxi Iron and Steel Plant. This old worker has walked a long road. As a young man, he "roamed through the Northeast," and for many years, he watched the iron he had painstakingly refined being transported to Japan, while his brothers suffered all kinds of torture from the Japanese devils. How he wished China would become strong! After "August Fifteenth" (end of WWII), he thought he could refine iron for his own country. He waited excitedly for the furnace to start, but the furnace didn't start, and the supplies were almost all stolen and sold by the "receiving" officials of the Kuomintang. Not long after liberation, one night, a person in a gray military uniform came to his house and said to him, "Master, we're going to refine iron. Please come to work tomorrow." "Refine iron?" The master looked at the stranger with suspicion. "Yes, refine iron, Master," the comrade smiled, "Now we workers are in charge." The master, who couldn't be bent even by a hammer, couldn't help but burst into tears at that moment. "I'll go, I'll go right now!"
    He has done his best for the motherland in recent years, and he retired two years ago. But in 1958, when the Party called on the whole Party and all the people to vigorously develop steel, this old worker asked to stand on the steel front again: "My body is still strong, and I can contribute to building socialism."
    He rushed to Wuhu and was assigned to work at the Dayou Iron and Steel Plant. On the first day he arrived at the factory, he dropped his baggage and disappeared without a trace. He examined everything, and when he saw the furnace that had just started, he rushed to the Party Secretary: "We are building furnaces to refine iron, not building walls to build houses. That furnace must be rebuilt, and the seams must be aligned!"
    The Party Secretary saw at a glance that this was a serious worker. He liked the old man from the bottom of his heart and said enthusiastically, "Master, we will definitely do as you say."
    He was surrounded by young people, who came from all directions and all walks of life. Every day, the master stood on the hillside, holding the hands of those young people, teaching them how to wield a sledgehammer, hold an iron chisel, and block a fake taphole. Day and night without rest. A young furnace worker told me that when he first came, he felt it was too tiring and didn't want to do it. The master persuaded him with moving enthusiasm. "Young man, you really don't know how lucky you are. Let me tell you, in the old society, we never refined steel for ourselves. But now, we are working for ourselves! Chairman Mao has arranged a bright future for each of you..."
    Now, the master has truly spread his peach and plum trees all over Wuhu. More than five hundred apprentices, some are excellent furnace workers, and some are shift leaders managing a furnace.
    "Now, it's very different from last year." The master stood on the hillside, facing the blast furnace group centered on Dayou, and said to me, "Dayou alone produces 110 tons of high-quality iron every day. The young people are all excellent. Now, handing the furnace over to them is as reassuring as handing it over to myself."
    Recently, the master went to the Wuhu Iron and Steel Plant to inspect the newly built "Dayang Group." After twelve o'clock at night, the Party Secretary and Director of Wugang finished their meeting. As soon as they came out, the master handed a letter to the Director: "The things to pay attention to when building this furnace are all on this." He also said to the Secretary, "You have to find someone quickly. Once the furnace is started, you can't grab it all at once."
    The Secretary pulled him into the room, turned on the light, and the master's huge figure was projected onto the newly painted wall. He said seriously to the Secretary, "Dayou can let go. Transfer me to the big furnace."

    宝刀不老
    李纳
    我到了芜湖四褐山，绕过许多排列整齐的小高炉，在山坡上一座红砖房里找到沈玉亭老师傅的寝室。我推开门，屋里静悄悄地，炉火烧得正旺，桌上半碗面还冒着热气，一支筷子掉在火炉里，已经烧去一半。主人一定是非常的忙。我等待许久，才听到一阵脚步声，跟着进来一个人，高大，挺直，满头的白发，衬着一张容光焕发的脸。他一进门，也不问站着迎接他的人是谁，便大声说：“来电啦！”把宽大的手掌送给我：“电线坏了。”他用毛巾抹去额前的汗珠，又侧着耳朵听了一会，才满意地点点头。有人告诉我，他耳朵有点聋，可是即使在梦里，也能辨别鼓风机的声音。
    沈老师傅，六十六岁，本溪炼铁厂的退休工人。这位老工人走过一条漫长的道路。青年时“闯过关东”，曾经有过多少年，他天天看着自己辛勤炼出来的铁，一车车的运往日本，而自己的兄弟却受着鬼子的各种折磨，他多么希望中国强盛起来啊！“八一五”后，他以为可以为自己的国家炼铁了，兴奋地等着开炉，谁想炉没有开，物资倒被国民党的“接收”大员盗卖得差不多了。解放后不久，一天夜里，他家中来了个穿灰军装的人，对他说：“老师傅，要炼铁了，请你明天去上班。”“炼铁？”老师傅惊疑地看定那位生客。“是炼铁，老师傅”那位同志笑起来：“现在咱们工人当家作主了。”铁锤也砸不弯的老师傅，这一刹那间忍不住热泪纵横，“我去，我这就去！”
    他这几年来为祖国尽了自己的努力，他在前两年退休了。但是1958年，党号召全党全民大办钢铁的时候，这位老工人又要求站到钢铁前线来：“我身板还结实，能为建设社会主义出力。”
    他赶到芜湖，被分配到大有钢铁厂工作。到厂的头天，一撂下包袱，就跑得无影无踪。他查看着一切，查看到刚动手的炉子，便直冲冲地去找党委书记：“咱们是砌炉子炼铁，可不是砌墙盖房子。那炉要重砌，缝要对严！”
    党委书记一眼就看透这是一个工作认真的人，他从心里喜欢这个老头，热情洋溢地说：“老师傅，我们一定照你的话做。”
    在他的身边尽是年青人，他们来自四面八方，各行各业。老师傅每日在山坡上，把着那些年青人的手，教他们抡大锤，掌铁钎，堵假铁口。日夜不息。一个青年炉前工对我说，他乍来，觉得太吃累，不想干了。老师傅以感人的热诚说服了他。“小伙子，你真是身在福中不知福，给你说，在旧社会，我们哪里给自己炼过钢铁，可现在，我们是在为自己干活啊！毛主席给你们个个都安排了锦绣前程……。”
    现在，老师傅真是桃李遍芜湖，五百多徒弟，有的是优秀的炉前工，有的是管理一座炉的值班长。
    “现在，和去年大不相同啦。”老师傅站在山坡上，迎着以大有为中心的高炉群，对我说：“单大有就日产优质铁一百一十吨，年青人个个是好样的，这时，把炉交给他们，跟交给自个一样放心了。”
    最近，老师傅到了芜湖钢铁厂，查看新建的“大洋群”。夜里十二点已过，芜钢党委书记和厂长开完会，一出门，老师傅便交一封信给厂长：“建这炉要注意哪些事，都在这上头。”又对书记说：“得赶快找人，炉一开，一下抓不来。”
    书记拉着他走进屋里，拧亮了灯，老师傅巨大的身影投在新刷的墙上。他严肃地对书记说：“大有能丢开手了，把我调到大炉上去吧。”
