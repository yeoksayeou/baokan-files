To Create, But Also to Promote
Wu Zhenduo, Director of the Infrastructure Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    In the technical innovation movement, the Jingdezhen Municipal Construction Engineering Company learned and promoted the advanced experience of the "one-dragon" system from fraternal provinces, finding a practical and feasible path for the technical innovation movement of construction enterprises in Jiangxi Province.

    The main advantage of the "one-dragon" technical innovation lies in its grasp of the key link in construction (which is the "dragon head") and its close combination of all relevant supporting links (which are the "dragon body" and "dragon tail"). In an enterprise, there are key links for the entire enterprise, as well as key links within each type of work. A "big dragon" is formed with the key link of the entire enterprise as the center, and many "small dragons" are formed with the key links within each type of work as the center. In this way, it is possible to avoid the imbalance of development between types of work and between work procedures, where advanced departments are "held back" by backward departments, affecting the overall completion of the plan. The entire enterprise can then be interlocked, with one link innovating, and each link innovating, promoting each other, and comprehensively improving.

    The advantage of the "one-dragon" technical innovation also lies in its ability to consolidate the achievements of innovation. Because the "one-dragon" is formed around the key links of production, it is necessary to identify various advanced machines and tools for innovation, select the most suitable advanced machines and tools to fix them, match them into a set, and promote them simultaneously in all relevant types of work. Of course, with the development of the technical innovation movement, more advanced machines and tools will continue to emerge. Therefore, the selection, standardization, and matching of advanced machines and tools into "dragons" is a regular task, and it is necessary to continuously improve and upgrade various machines and tools.

    To implement this experience, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party and adhere to putting politics in command. As it now appears, the importance of technical innovation and technical revolution is generally known in principle, but in actual work, there are some incorrect understandings. Some comrades believe that "technical innovation is a distant water that cannot quench a present thirst," while others emphasize that "the conditions are not yet in place, so technical innovation cannot be carried out." The root of these incorrect understandings mainly lies in the thinking of "valuing foreign things and belittling local things" and "valuing creation and belittling promotion." In the technical innovation movement, not only should we engage in foreign methods, but also in local methods; not only should we create, but also promote. It is good to have creation in foreign methods, and we should actively support it; it is also good to engage in local methods and promote the advanced experience of others, and we should actively support it; this is also technical innovation. Because the Party organization of the Jingdezhen Construction Company educated the workers to correctly understand the importance of the "combining indigenous and foreign methods" policy, they adopted the method of starting from local methods, from simple to complex, using foreign methods when possible, using local methods when foreign methods are not available, and combining local and foreign methods. At the same time, they not only recognized the importance of creation, but also recognized the need to humbly learn from the advanced experience of other places and earnestly promote it. Therefore, in just four months, they basically realized the mechanization of vertical transportation, the motorization of ground transportation, and the universal improvement of tools.

    In the "one-dragon" technical innovation movement, organizational work must also be strengthened accordingly. In a certain period, it is necessary to propose a plan for the "one-dragon" technical innovation, determine the "big dragon" and "small dragon," distinguish the "dragon head," "dragon body," and "dragon tail," and ensure close cooperation with each other. The technical innovation plan should be widely organized for discussion, modification, and supplementation by the masses, and then officially announced for implementation. The purpose of the technical innovation plan is to ensure the completion and over-completion of the enterprise's production plan. Therefore, each time when deploying and inspecting the production plan, it is necessary to deploy and inspect the work of technical innovation and promptly solve various problems in the movement. At the same time, in terms of material supply, labor organization, and other management systems, it is also necessary to make corresponding improvements with the development of the movement. In particular, the system of "three-way combination" of leading cadres, technicians, and workers must be conscientiously implemented. The experience of the Jingdezhen Construction Company proves that leading cadres going deep into the production site can promptly discover and solve problems, strengthen organizational work, and encourage the enthusiasm of the masses. Technicians going deep into the production site can help workers with calculations and drawings, and can enrich theoretical knowledge with the practical experience of workers.

### 要创造　也要推广

    要创造　也要推广
    中共江西省委基建委员会主任　吴甄铎
    景德镇市建筑工程公司在技术革新运动中，学习和推广兄弟省的“一条龙”的先进经验，为江西省建筑企业的技术革新运动找到了一条切实可行的道路。
    “一条龙”技术革新的主要好处，在于它抓住了施工中的关键环节（这就是“龙头”），并把各有关配合环节（这就是“龙身”和“龙尾”）紧密地结合起来。在一个企业里，有整个企业的关键环节，也有各工种内部的关键环节，以整个企业的关键环节为中心组成一条“大龙”，以各工种内部的关键环节为中心组成许多“小龙”。这样，就可以避免工种之间和工序之间发展不平衡，先进部门被后进部门“拉后腿”，影响计划不能全面地完成；整个企业就可以一环扣一环，一环革新，环环革新，互相促进，全面提高。
      “一条龙”技术革新的好处，还在于它能把革新成就巩固下来。由于“一条龙”是围绕生产关键环节配成的，因此，对于革新的各种先进机具必须加以鉴定，选择最适用的先进机具固定下来，配成一套，各有关工种同时推广。当然，随着技术革新运动的发展，更先进的机具会不断地产生，因此，对先进机具的选型、定型和配套成“龙”是一个经常性的工作，必须把各种机具不断地改进和提高。
    推行这一经验，必须加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。现在看来，对技术革新和技术革命的重要性，一般人在道理上是知道的，但在实际工作中却存在一些不正确的认识。有的同志认为“技术革新是远水不救近火”，有的强调“条件不具备，不能搞技术革新”。这些不正确认识的根源，主要是存在“重洋轻土”和“重创造轻推广”的思想。在技术革新运动中，不仅要搞洋的，同时也要搞土的，不仅要创造，也要推广。搞洋的，有创造固然很好，要积极支持；搞土的、推广别人的先进经验也很好，也要积极支持，也是技术革新。景德镇建筑公司由于党组织教育职工正确地认识了“土洋并举”方针的重要意义，采取了从土起步、从简到繁、能洋就洋、无洋就土、土洋结合的办法。同时不仅认识到创造的重要性，而且认识了必须虚心地学习外地的先进经验，认真地加以推广。所以，在短短的四个月中，他们就基本上实现了垂直运输卷扬化、平地运输车子化、工具改良普遍化。
    在“一条龙”的技术革新运动中，组织工作也要相应地加强。在一定时期内，要提出“一条龙”技术革新的规划，确定“大龙”和“小龙”，分清“龙头”、“龙身”和“龙尾”，做到互相密切配合。技术革新规划，要广泛地组织群众讨论和修改补充，然后正式公布执行。技术革新规划的目的，是确保企业生产计划的完成和超额完成。因此，每次在部署和检查生产计划的同时，都要部署和检查技术革新的工作，并及时解决运动中的各种问题。与此同时，在材料供应、劳动组织等管理制度方面，也要随着运动的发展而作相适应的改进。特别是对于领导干部、技术人员和工人“三结合”的制度，必须认真地贯彻执行。景德镇建筑公司的经验证明：领导干部深入生产现场，可以及时发现问题和解决问题，加强组织工作，鼓舞群众的干劲。技术人员深入生产现场，可以帮助工人计算、绘图，可以用工人的实际经验丰富理论知识。
