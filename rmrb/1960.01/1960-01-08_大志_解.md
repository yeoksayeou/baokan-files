Interpretation of "Lofty Ambition"
Ge De

After reading a communication from the China Youth Daily titled "Wiping Bai Gui Mountain off the Face of the Earth," I have further understood what it means to "set lofty ambitions."

At the Bai Gui Mountain Reservoir construction site in Henan Province, innovation expert Sang Jinlei, in order to ensure the smooth construction of the dam, had to race against time against the floods, overcome various difficulties, and innovate and create twelve new types of tools. He finally moved the entire Bai Gui Mountain before the flood season arrived.

"Moving mountains and seas" and creating tools are not new things in our country. However, the following passage is very enlightening to read. Once, when faced with difficulties, he remembered a flood in his childhood before liberation, when the land was submerged, houses were washed away, and his family fled to other places. His parents and younger brother all died outside. This suffering made him determined after liberation to follow the Party, resolutely implement the Party's call to control mountains and rivers, to make the water obey orders, and never let it harm people again. So he thought: "Now we must fundamentally control the Sha River, ensure that the millions of people downstream are not harmed by floods, and irrigate more than 2.76 million mu of land in thirteen counties, as well as supply industrial water, generate electricity, and provide navigation. What a great undertaking this is! I made such a great determination when I came here, how can I retreat just because I encountered a little difficulty!"

After reading this passage, we cannot help but think: What is "lofty ambition"? Is it that as long as you have the determination to move a mountain, it is called having "lofty ambition"? More than two thousand years ago, King Xiang of Chu claimed to be a hero with "strength to uproot mountains and spirit to overwhelm the world," but in the end, he was "heroically short-lived" and slit his own throat. Can we say that he had any "lofty ambition"? Is any determination to reform or create tools called having "lofty ambition"? Further extrapolation, is any determination to write a book, to create an invention, or to do some scientific research called "lofty ambition"? Not necessarily. Because we have seen "one-bookism" advocates, and various extremely individualistic "personal struggle" advocates, who sometimes also shout "Where there's a will, there's a way," but they are only going all out for their own fame, fortune, status, and generous rewards. When their personal struggles conflict with the interests of the people, the interests of the country, and the interests of the Party, they disregard these interests and resolutely "eliminate" and "overthrow" everything. Among them, some have temporarily realized some of their wishes, and then become complacent, placing themselves above the collective, and opposing the Party, and soon they also fall down; while those whose wishes are not satisfied complain about heaven and earth, full of grievances and frustrated complaints. These people's ambitions have become wild ambitions, their tastes are low, and their styles are base. How can we talk about lofty ambitions?

So, what is considered a lofty ambition? Only people like Sang Jinlei have lofty ambitions. In order to save the tens of millions of people downstream of the Sha River from the tragic fate of family destruction and death in his childhood, in order to irrigate the land in thirteen counties downstream, and in order to make the water power of the Sha River serve people's electricity generation, navigation, and industrial development, he is determined to fundamentally control the Sha River under the leadership of the Party; in a word, a lofty ideal and firm determination to transform things that are greatly harmful to the people into things that are greatly beneficial to the people, is what counts as a lofty ambition. He is determined to move this mountain in order to realize his aspirations, and this moving of the mountain becomes a lofty ambition. He is determined to realize the reform and creation of tools in order to move this mountain, and this reform and creation of tools also becomes a lofty ambition. Under the leadership of the Party, he unites the surrounding partners, tenaciously overcomes various difficulties, and is determined to realize tool reform and move the entire Bai Gui Mountain, not for personal fame in the world, or to obtain generous rewards and remuneration. Therefore, when he encounters difficulties, the driving force that encourages him to overcome these difficulties is not "reputation and status" or "material interests" or any personal plans, but the interests of tens of millions of people. In this way, he has no personal interests to weigh or calculate, so he will not have the slightest fear of difficulties. Here, we can also understand: only those who are completely selfless can be the strongest and bravest.

Therefore, the "lofty ambition" problem is fundamentally a question of outlook on life and worldview. We say that the spirit of communism is the greatest ambition of present life, because realizing communism is to seek the highest interests for all mankind, and to most thoroughly eliminate the scourge for all mankind. Communism has never been an empty beautiful fantasy, but a scientific ideal. Today, in front of us, it is even more a picture that is gradually becoming a reality and that requires us to vigorously promote its realization through various concrete constructions. At present, for each of us, whether we have established this lofty ambition mainly depends on whether he can connect his specific work with this grand aspiration and lofty goal in a flesh-and-blood way. Sang Jinlei clearly understood the relationship between his creation of a tool and the lives of tens of millions of people downstream of the Sha River. Can each of us understand the relationship between our work and the realization of socialism and communism as clearly as he does? If we understand this relationship, we will further understand that we only have the obligation to overcome all difficulties and best complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the people, and we have no right to be picky, seek fame, or compete for profit.

"Lofty ambition" means having both the lofty ideals of communism and being able to use the highest creativity to make as many contributions as possible to the people and the cause of communism through one's specific work. Combining great ideals with creative activities in ordinary work is a lofty ambition with flesh and blood. Therefore, the size of ambition cannot be distinguished by the type of work.

### “大志”解

    “大志”解
    葛德
    从中国青年报上读了一篇题为“把白龟山从地球上抹掉”的通讯，对“立大志”又有了进一步的理解。
    在河南省白龟山水库工地上，革新能手桑金垒，为了保证拦河大坝顺利施工，要同洪水争夺时间，克服各种困难，革新和创造了十二种新式工具，终于在汛期到来以前，把整座白龟山搬掉了。
    “移山倒海”和创制工具，在我们国家里，都不算是什么新奇的事了。但是，下面一段描写，读来是大有启发的。有一次，他在困难面前想起了解放前他童年时候的一场水灾，土地淹没，房子漂走，一家人逃荒到外地，爹娘和弟弟，都死在了外边。这种痛苦，使他在解放后下决心一定要跟党走，坚决实现党的治山治水的号召，要叫水听使唤，再不叫它害人。于是他想：“现在要根治沙河，保证下游千万人民不受水害，要使十三个县二百七十六万多亩地受到灌溉，还供应工业用水、发电、航运。这是多么伟大的事业！来的时候自己下了多大决心，怎能因为遇到一点困难就打退堂鼓呢！”
    读了这一段以后，我们不免要这样想：什么叫“大志”？是不是只要有了任何搬掉一座山的决心就叫有“大志”？两千多年以前的楚霸王，就曾自命是“力拔山兮气盖世”的英雄，但是他最后竟是“英雄气短”，自己抹了脖子。我们能说他有什么“大志”吗？是不是任何一种改革或创制工具的决心都叫有“大志”？进一步类推，是不是任何想写一本书的决心、想搞一种发明的决心、想作某种科学研究的决心，都叫“大志”？也未必。因为我们曾看见过“一本书主义”者，曾看见过种种极端个人主义的“个人奋斗”者，他们有时也高喊“有志者事竟成”，但他们只不过是时时刻刻在为自己的名利地位，优厚报酬而全力以赴，当他们的个人奋斗同人民的利益，国家的利益，党的利益发生矛盾时，他们便置这些利益于不顾，而奋然要“排除”要“打倒”这一切。他们之中，有的人也曾暂时的实现过自己的某些愿望，于是便踌躇满志，个人高踞集体之上，同党闹对立，不久便也跌翻下来；而愿望得不到满足的人，便怨天恨地，一肚子委屈和失意的牢骚。这些人雄心已成野心，趣味低级，风格卑劣，哪里还谈得上大志呢？
    那末，什么才算是大志呢？像桑金垒这样的才算有大志。他为了使沙河下游几千万人，免除他幼年那样家破人亡的悲惨命运，为了使下游十三个县的土地得到灌溉，为了使沙河的水力服务于人们的发电、航运、办工业，他决心在党的领导下根治沙河；一句话，像这种要把对人民有大害的事改造成对人民有大利的事的崇高理想和坚强决心，才算是大志。他为了实现自己的志愿而决心去搬掉这座山，这搬山便成了大志，为了搬掉这座山而决心去实现改创工具，这改创工具便也成了大志。他在党的领导下，团结周围的伙伴，顽强地克服种种困难，决心实现工具改革和搬掉整座白龟山，绝不是为了个人名扬于世，得到优厚的奖赏和报酬，因此，当他遇到困难的时候，鼓舞他去克服这些困难的动力也就不是“名誉地位”、“物质利益”等一切个人打算，而是几千万人的利害。这样，他便没有个人的利害轻重可权衡，可计较，因而对困难也就不会产生丝毫畏怯之心。这里也可以使我们明白：只有完全忘我的人，才能是最坚强最勇敢的。
    因此，“大志”问题，从根本上说是一个人生观和世界观的问题。我们说，共产主义的事业心，是现在人生的最大志向，那原因就在于实现共产主义，就是为全人类谋求最高的利益，是为全人类最彻底的铲除祸害。共产主义从来就不是一个空洞的美丽幻想，而是科学的理想，今天，在我们面前，它更是一个正要逐步成为现实而又要我们通过各种具体建设大力促其实现的图景了。当前，对于我们每一个人来说，有没有树立了这种大志主要就是看他是否能够把自己所从事的具体工作，同这个宏大的志愿和崇高的目标有血有肉的联系起来。桑金垒非常明白他创制一种工具同沙河下游几千万人民生活的关系。我们每个人是否都能像他那样明白自己的工作同实现社会主义和共产主义的关系呢？如果明白了这种关系，便会进一步明白自己只有克服一切困难，最好地完成党和人民交给自己的任务的义务，决没有挑肥拣瘦争名夺利的权利的。
      “大志”就是既具有共产主义的崇高理想，又能用最高的创造性，通过自己所从事的具体工作，对人民和共产主义事业作出尽可能多的贡献。把伟大的理想和平凡工作中的创造性活动结合起来，这才是有血有肉的大志。因此，志的大小，也是不能以工作的类别作区分的。
