Water Conservancy Inspection Teams Promote Everywhere
Hunan Checks Construction Quality and Completeness of Projects

Guangxi Inspects While Promoting Advanced Technology

(Our report) Hunan Province has adopted the method of "three-way combination" of cadres, peasants, and technicians to organize more than one million people to participate in the large-scale water conservancy inspection. According to incomplete statistics, of the 750,000 small-scale projects completed throughout the province, about 600,000 have been inspected and accepted by the masses, with over 90% meeting the engineering quality standards. A small number of water conservancy projects with insufficient quality have been promptly organized by the masses for processing and repair.

In late November of last year, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized a group of leading cadres to lead engineering technicians to various water conservancy sites to cooperate with cadres from various special districts and counties to conduct a water conservancy inspection lasting more than 20 days. Recently, another large-scale water conservancy inspection and acceptance movement of one million people has been launched across the province to ensure the complete completion of all projects.

During the inspection and acceptance process, various places generally started with affirming achievements and summarizing experiences to conduct large-scale comparisons and competitions. In the inspection, Xiangyin County commended 21,000 model commune members, summarized the advanced experiences and deeds of more than 100 advanced units and more than 400 model cadres, and held multiple on-site meetings, where everyone's enthusiasm doubled. After evaluation and inspection, six communes and 78 production brigades in the county not only enabled more than 70,000 mu of paddy fields that had not yet achieved a hundred days of guaranteed harvest without rain to achieve the ability to resist drought for a hundred days, but also increased the area of double-cropping rice by more than 40,000 mu.

During the inspection, various places paid special attention to engineering quality, finishing work, completeness, and overcoming imbalances in construction. The Xiangtan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party found more than 2,000 reservoir project channels that had not been opened during the inspection, and immediately organized 100,000 people to open them up. The Hengyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party found that the progress of large and medium-sized projects was unbalanced, so it dispatched more than 4,000 cadres and more than 80,000 laborers to the 30 large and medium-sized projects that were progressing slowly, and took measures such as building rain shelters on the construction site, increasing rain gear, and digging ditches to drain water and repair roads to overcome wind, rain, and severe cold. In a few days, five medium-sized projects were completed ahead of schedule.

(Our report) The large-scale water conservancy project inspection organized by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has pushed the large-scale water conservancy construction movement in Hubei Province to a new climax. In the week from December 15th to 21st during the inspection, the number of completed projects increased to more than 65,000. The results of the acceptance inspection showed that the quality of the vast majority of projects met the original design standards.

Zhang Tixue, Deputy Head of the Water Conservancy Inspection Team of the Provincial Committee and Governor of Hubei Province, led the inspection team members to inspect the Lishui Hub Project, the Fuhe and Huanhe Diversion Projects in the Wuhan area, and the water conservancy construction in Suixian and Zaoyang and other places. When Zhang Tixue and others inspected the Yunmeng County section of the Fuhe and Huanhe Diversion Projects, they carefully inspected the living conditions of the laborers. He went deep into the construction site kitchen, talked with the cooks, and inquired about the food and accommodation conditions on the construction site, which greatly promoted the living welfare of the laborers on this construction site. Now, every canteen on the construction site ensures that grain is rationed according to the number of people, and there are hot meals and dishes for three meals a day. In addition to the laborers reclaiming land and growing vegetables on the construction site, the people's communes also sent special personnel to organize vegetable sources from the rear to ensure that the laborers were well-fed. At the same time, more than 140 laundry groups were organized on the construction site to wash clothes and bedding for the laborers.

The general team and each sub-team of the inspection team summarized and promoted the good experiences of water management in various places during the inspection.

(Xinhua News Agency, Nanning) Various places in Guangxi have organized inspection teams to go deep into construction sites to inspect water conservancy construction.

The inspection teams in various places paid special attention to organizing technological innovation and promoting advanced experiences. For example, the Kelan Reservoir in Nanning Prefecture was doing a good job in the high-efficiency movement, so the inspection team assisted relevant units in holding on-site meetings here to exchange experiences. As a result, the average daily work efficiency of laborers on various water conservancy construction sites in the entire prefecture quickly increased from 0.6 cubic meters to 10 cubic meters, so that most of the water conservancy projects in the entire prefecture could be completed before the Spring Festival. When the Yulin Prefectural Inspection Team inspected the Laohutou Reservoir in Bobai County, it found that the soil transportation process of the reservoir could not keep up with the needs of soil filling, so it helped the construction site to reform transportation tools, changing single-wheeled wooden carts to double-wheeled carts, wooden wheel carts to iron wheel carts, and short-armed carts to long-armed carts, which increased the soil transportation efficiency by 42%.

After the arrival of the inspection team, the vast number of laborers were greatly encouraged. They expressed that they must promote technological innovation to a new stage, further improve work efficiency, and strive to complete the work ahead of schedule to thank the care of the Party and the people.

    水利检查团到处促进
    湖南查施工质量查工程成套
    湖北重视改进民工生活福利
    广西边检查边推广先进技术
    本报讯　湖南省采取干部、农民、技术员“三结合”的办法，组织一百多万人参加的水利大检查。据不完全统计，全省已完工的七十五万处小型工程，已组织群众检查验收了约六十来万处，90％以上合乎工程质量标准，少数质量不够好的水利工程，随即组织群众进行了加工补修。
    去年11月下旬，中共湖南省委组织了一批领导干部带领工程技术人员分赴各水利工地，配合各专、县干部进行了为期二十多天的水利大检查。最近各地又掀起了一百万人的水利大检查验收运动，确保工程全部成套。
    各地在检查验收中，一般从肯定成绩、总结经验入手，大搞评比竞赛。湘阴县在检查中表扬了两万一千名模范社员，并总结了百多个先进单位和四百多名模范干部的先进经验和先进事迹，多次召开工地现场会，一比一看，人人干劲倍增。全县有六个公社、七十八个生产大队通过评比检查后，不仅使还未达到百日无雨保丰收的七万多亩稻田全部达到抗旱百日的能力，还增加了四万多亩双季稻面积。
    在检查中，各地特别注意工程质量、扫尾、成套和克服施工中的不平衡现象。中共湘潭地委在大检查中，发现有两千多处水库工程渠道未挖通，当即组织十万人突击开通了。中共衡阳地委发现大中型工程进度不平衡，就对进度较慢的三十处大中型工程，加派干部四千多人、民工八万多人，采取工地搭盖防雨棚、增加雨具、开沟排水修路等办法，战胜风雨严寒，几天中即有五处中型工程提前完成。
    本报讯　中共湖北省委组织的水利工程大检查，把湖北省大规模的水利建设运动推向了一个新的高潮。在大检查中的12月15日到21日这一周时间，完工工程已增加到六万五千多处。验收结果表明，绝大多数工程的质量都达到了原来设计标准。
    省委水利检查团副总团长、湖北省省长张体学同志，曾率领检查团人员先后检查了武汉地区的陆水枢纽工程、府河、澴河改道工程和随县、枣阳等地的水利建设。张体学同志等在府、澴河改道工程云梦县工段检查时，细致地检查了民工生活，他深入到工地厨房，和炊事员们谈了话，询问了工地伙食、居住情况，大大促进了这个工地的民工生活福利。现在每个工地食堂都做到粮食依人定量，每日三餐都是热饭热菜，除了民工们在工地开荒种菜外，各人民公社还在后方派专人组织菜源，保证了民工吃饱吃好。同时，工地上还组织了一百四十多个洗衣组为民工洗衣洗被。
    检查团总团和各分团，在检查中都对各地治水的好经验作了总结和推广。
    据新华社南宁讯　广西各地纷纷组织检查团，深入工地检查水利建设。
    各地检查团特别注意组织技术革新和推广先进经验。如南宁专区客兰水库开展高工效运动好，检查团便协助有关单位在这里召开现场会议，互相交流经验，因之全专区各水利工地民工的平均日工效迅速从零点六立方米提高到十立方米，使全专区的水利工程大部分可在春节前完工。玉林专区检查团在博白县老虎头水库检查时，发现这个水库运土工序赶不上填土的需要，便帮助工地改革运输工具，把单轮木车改为双轮车，木轮车改为铁轮车，短臂车改为长臂车，使运土工效提高了42％。
    广大民工在检查团到来后，受到极大鼓舞，他们纷纷表示，一定要把技术革新推进到一个新阶段，更高的提高工效，争取提早完工，答谢党和人民的关怀。
