Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th - U.S. President Eisenhower today submitted his annual report on the U.S. economy to the U.S. Congress. In his report, he did his best to gloss over the crisis-ridden U.S. economy. However, in doing so, he could not completely conceal his lack of confidence in whether the current slight recovery of the U.S. economy could be sustained, and he expressed obvious unease about the huge threat of inflation and the balance of payments deficit.

In describing the economic situation in 1959, Eisenhower mentioned that because steel users foresaw the impending steelworkers' strike, they "pre-purchased steel and steel products, thus causing (U.S.) national production to increase rapidly in the first half of 1959." Then, "the gross national product declined in the third quarter because (the steelworkers' strike) idled approximately 85% of steel production capacity," "producing an increasingly contracting economic impact." However, based on the slight improvement in the economic situation at the end of the year, Eisenhower boasted that "the vitality of those basic forces that drive U.S. economic growth was very clear in 1959," and "the prospects for continued economic growth in 1960 and beyond are good." But even according to the figures cited by Eisenhower, the U.S. national output of goods and services in the fourth quarter of 1959 was only 3.5% higher than in the same period of 1958, and the army of unemployed still numbered 3.6 million, much higher than before the outbreak of the 1957-1958 economic crisis.

Eisenhower estimated that business demand for capital goods and inventories would increase this year, but "this increase is partly a reflection of the need to make up for the time lost due to the delayed and postponed projects caused by the steel strike." Spending on housing construction, which accounts for the second largest category of U.S. capital investment, will also be smaller than in 1959. In terms of government spending (primarily military spending), although he predicted that there would "necessarily be some increase" this year, and that the "trend of increased spending" by local governments would "continue." However, given that the U.S. national debt has exceeded $290 billion and inflation is constantly developing, he had to simultaneously emphasize the need to maintain a "surplus" in the budget in order to "help curb inflationary pressures" and "strengthen domestic and international confidence in the dollar."

Eisenhower repeatedly revealed his fear of another economic crisis. He admitted that a new economic crisis remains a "matter of concern for all Americans." He worried that the blind expansion of production after the crisis would quickly bring about the next crisis. He said, "We must avoid speculative excesses, which will make the life of (economic) growth short and thus make the growth rate unsustainable." He also said that the U.S. economy in the next decade must cope with "major challenges" and must find ways to reduce "fluctuations in economic development" and "strive for a more stable growth rate."

Eisenhower indicated that his government would continue to act as a "compliant tool" of U.S. monopoly capital. He said that the U.S. government can make an "important contribution" to U.S. economic development, which is that it can "create conditions to encourage and strengthen the efforts of individuals and private groups to improve their situations." This U.S. President, who forced steelworkers to end their strike last year, also wants workers in basic industries to "best avoid the use of strikes" in labor disputes. Under the pretext of "avoiding fueling inflation," he opposed workers' demands for wage increases, saying that wages and labor benefits can only "increase without jeopardizing price stability." Although, everyone knows that workers are demanding wage increases precisely because their living standards have been harmed by the inflation caused by the U.S. government.

Eisenhower spoke with even more concern in the report about the U.S.'s external economic situation. Eisenhower admitted that "as in 1958, U.S. spending in international transactions greatly exceeded income in 1959," and "the transfer (editor's note: meaning outflow) of gold and liquid dollar assets caused by the overall balance of payments deficit reached an annual rate of $4.5 billion in the second quarter of 1959." He estimated that in 1960 "the overall balance of payments deficit is still likely to be quite large." Eisenhower admitted that the reason for this situation is the change in the U.S.'s position in international trade in recent years. He pointed out that U.S. exports in the first eleven months of 1959 were "roughly the same as in the same period of 1958" (note: 1958 decreased by $3.2 billion compared to 1957), while imports increased unusually rapidly. The report said that exports of many U.S. items decreased last year, with automobiles and steel being "particularly prominent." Eisenhower believed that this change in trade was mainly due to the "restoration and development of production capacity" in other capitalist countries. Eisenhower emphasized that the U.S. must strengthen its exports to "adjust" the balance of payments. He stated that the U.S. will continue to pressure other capitalist countries to implement "free trade" policies to facilitate U.S. exports.

### 艾森豪威尔向国会提出经济报告  竭力掩饰美国经济危机四伏的状况

    艾森豪威尔向国会提出经济报告
    竭力掩饰美国经济危机四伏的状况
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔今天向美国国会提出了一年一度的美国经济报告。他在报告中竭力替危机四伏的美国经济擦脂抹粉。但是他在这样做的同时，也无法完全掩饰他对于美国经济目前微小回升能否维持下去缺乏信心，并对通货膨胀以及国际收支赤字巨大威胁表现了明显的不安。
    艾森豪威尔在叙述1959年经济情况时，谈到由于钢铁用户预见到将要发生钢铁工人大罢工而“预先收购钢铁和钢铁产品，因而使得（美国）全国生产在1959年上半年很快地增加”。接着，“国民生产总值在第三季度下降了，因为（钢铁工人的大罢工使得）大约85％的钢铁生产能力闲下来”，“产生了经济日益收缩的影响”。但是，艾森豪威尔以年底的经济情况稍有好转为根据，吹嘘说：“促使美国经济增长的那些基本力量的活力在1959年是非常清楚的”，“在1960年和1960年以后经济不断增长的前景是良好的”。但是即使根据艾森豪威尔所举出的数字，1959年第四季度的美国全国货物和劳务产量也不过比1958年同期增长了3．5％，而失业大军仍然有三百六十万人，比1957—1958年经济危机爆发前高得多。
    艾森豪威尔估计，今年企业对资本货物和存货的需求会有所上升，但是“这种增加部分地表现为由于钢铁罢工缺货而耽误和延缓的工程要弥补过去的时间”。占美国资本投资第二大类的住房建筑的开支规模也会比1959年小。在政府开支（其中首先是军事开支）方面，虽然他预料今年“必然有一定的增加”，而且地方政府的“支出增加的趋势会继续下去”。但是，鉴于美国国债已经超过二千九百亿美元，通货膨胀在不断发展，因此他不得不同时强调必须在预算中保持“盈余”，以“有助于遏制通货膨胀的压力”，“加强国内外对美元的信心”。
    艾森豪威尔一再透露出他对再次爆发经济危机的恐惧。他承认新的经济危机仍旧是“全体美国人所担忧的问题”。他担心在危机过去以后生产的盲目膨胀又会迅速带来下一个危机。他说：“我们必须避免投机性的过分行动，这种行动将使（经济）增长的寿命很短，因而使增长比率不能持久”。他还说，美国今后十年的经济必须应付“重大的挑战”，必须想办法来减少“经济发展中的波动”和为“争取一个更加稳定的增长速度而努力”。
    艾森豪威尔表明，他的政府要继续作为美国垄断资本的“顺从工具”。他说，美国政府在美国经济发展中可以起“重要的贡献”，这就是它可以“创造一种条件来鼓励并加强个人和私人团体的改善他们的情况的努力”。这个去年强制钢铁工人停止大罢工的美国总统还要基本工业的工人们在劳资纠纷中“最好不要采用罢工的方法”。他借口“避免助长通货膨胀”反对工人提高工资的要求，说什么工资和劳工福利只能“在不危害物价稳定的情况下增加”。虽然，大家知道，工人们正是因为生活水平遭到美国政府造成的通货膨胀的损害才起来要求提高工资的。
    艾森豪威尔在报告中以更为忧虑的心情谈到美国对外经济状况，艾森豪威尔承认，“1959年的情况同1958年一样，美国在国际交易中的支出大大超过了收入”，“由于总的收支差额而造成的黄金和流动美元财产的转移（编者注：指外流）在1959年第二季度达到年率四十五亿美元”。他估计1960年“整个对外收支逆差仍然可能是相当大的。”艾森豪威尔承认，造成这种情况的原因是近年来美国在国际贸易中的地位的变化。他指出，美国1959年头十一个月的输出额“同1958年同期大致相等”（按：1958年比1957年下降了三十二亿美元），而进口额增加得异常迅速。报告说，去年美国许多项目的出口在减少，其中汽车和钢铁表现得“特别突出”。艾森豪威尔认为贸易上的这种变化主要是由于其他资本主义国家“生产能力恢复和发展”。艾森豪威尔强调美国必须加强它的输出来“调整”对外收支。他表示美国要继续压迫其他资本主义国家实施“自由贸易”政策以便利美国的输出。
