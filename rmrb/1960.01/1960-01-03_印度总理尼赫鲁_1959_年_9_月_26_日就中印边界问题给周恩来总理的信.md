Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd: Indian Prime Minister Nehru wrote a letter to Premier Zhou Enlai on September 26, 1959, regarding the Sino-Indian boundary question. The full text is as follows:

Beijing

His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China:

Dear Premier:

I have received your letter of September 8, 1959. I must say that I was very surprised and saddened to read it. You and I discussed the Sino-Indian border, particularly the eastern sector, in Beijing in 1954 and in India in 1956 and 1957. As you know, the eastern sector of the boundary is generally referred to as the McMahon Line. I don't like this name, but for convenience, I suggest we call it that! When I talked to you about this issue, I thought the problem we faced was to agree on the exact location of the so-called McMahon Line in the eastern sector of the boundary. Even when I received your letter of January 23, 1959, I did not imagine that the People's Republic of China would lay claim to approximately 40,000 square miles of territory that we considered to have belonged indisputably to India for decades, and some parts for over a hundred years. In your recent letter, you have attempted to lay claim to large tracts of Indian territory, and even implied that the independent Indian government is seeking to reap the benefits of British aggression against China. Our Parliament and people are deeply indignant at this statement. The Indian people's struggle against all forms of imperialism, both domestic and foreign, is known and recognized throughout the world, and we had thought that China also understood and recognized our struggle. Indeed, the British occupied and ruled the Indian subcontinent against the will of the Indian people. However, India's borders have been settled for centuries by history, geography, custom, and tradition. Indeed, India's aversion to imperialist policies is nowhere more evident than in its attitude towards Tibet. The Indian government voluntarily relinquished all extraterritorial rights that Britain had enjoyed in Tibet before 1947, and recognized Tibet as a region of China through a treaty. In our long talks during your last visit to India, you told me that Tibet has always been and remains a part of China, but it is an autonomous region.

II. You state in your letter that the Indian government has exerted various pressures on the Chinese government, including the use of force, to make the Chinese government accept India's demands. This is the opposite of what the Indian government has done. We have not made public the information we have regarding the repeated border crossings by Chinese personnel into our territory since 1954, the construction of roads through Indian territory in Ladakh, and the arrest and detention of our personnel in the Aksai Chin area in 1958. We did not publicize these matters in the hope that our two countries could resolve these disputes peacefully through agreement without causing public excitement on both sides. In fact, our failure to do so has now provoked sharp but legitimate criticism of the government by our Parliament and press. We have not only not used force, but have sought peaceful solutions to disputes. You must be aware of the long negotiations between Indian and Chinese representatives regarding Barahoti in 1958, and the exchange of notes between the two governments regarding other disputes. I need not tell you that the action of your troops in overwhelming our post at Longju on our side of the McMahon Line with superior force has generated enormous anger in India; although you have not yet withdrawn your troops, we have not attempted to reoccupy this post.

III. You refer to maintaining the long-standing status quo of the border. This is what the Indian government has always favored. It is the Chinese government that has repeatedly violated this in recent years. For example, I can cite the following examples: the construction of a 100-mile road through India's traditional territory in the Aksai Chin area; the entry of a Chinese surveying team into the Lohit Frontier Division in 1957; the establishment of a camp in Spanggur in 1959; the dispatch of armed personnel to Barahoti in 1958 and their wintering there in violation of custom; and, last but not least, the use of force at Longju.

IV. Admittedly, the Sino-Indian border has not been formally demarcated along its entire length. In fact, the terrain in many places along the Sino-Indian border makes such physical demarcation on the ground impossible. But the entire border has been determined by treaty or confirmed by custom, or both, and until now, the Chinese government has never protested against the exercise of jurisdiction by the Indian government up to the customary border at any point. You yourself admit that until the beginning of this year, there had never been any armed conflict on our border. Successive Chinese governments have respected India's borders. The answer to this lies not in the weakness of previous Chinese governments. There has not even been a single protest lodged in accordance with established national practice in this regard, as was done on the Burma issue between 1906 and 1937.

V. Regarding the border between Tibet and Ladakh, it is incorrect to say that the then Chinese central government did not send anyone to participate in the 1842 treaty between Tibet and Kashmir. The Dalai Lama and the representative of the Chinese Emperor both signed the treaty. One of the signatories, Sokon Kaluon, although of Tibetan origin, held a Chinese official rank. Even the Tibetan text of the treaty clearly indicates that China was a party to it. Thus, it states: "Hereafter, there shall never be the slightest deviation from or damage to the alliance, friendship, and unity between the King of the World, Hesha Ji, and Bahadur, the Great King, and the Great Emperor of China and the Guru Lama of Lhasa."

VI. The 1842 treaty does indeed only mention "the old established boundaries." This is because these boundaries were well known and did not require any formal demarcation. Even the 1684 treaty between Ladakh and Tibet states, "The boundaries determined when Sgild-lda-niama-gon divided his three sons into kings should remain unchanged." Relevant materials in the 17th-century Ladakh chronicles indicate that the boundaries were completely determined. Cunningham, whom Your Excellency has praised, visited this area in 1846. In 1854 he said that the eastern border of Ladakh "is clearly marked by piles of stones, which were erected in 1687 after the Ladakhis obtained substantial assistance from Kashmir to finally drive out the Sokpo or Mongol forces." ("Ladakh," published in 1854, p. 261). Therefore, it is very clear that for nearly two centuries the boundary between Ladakh and Tibet has been well known and recognized by both sides. During these two centuries, according to the provisions of these treaties, there has been continuous trade between Ladakh and Tibet, and there have never been border conflicts.

VII. Your letter states that China has never ratified the 1842 treaty. China's recognition of this treaty can be demonstrated by the fact that Chinese officials informed the British government in 1847 that "regarding the boundary, please allow me to say that the boundaries of these territories are fully and clearly determined, and therefore, it would be much more convenient to abide by this old arrangement and not take additional measures for demarcation." There is no indication that the Chinese government considered this treaty to be invalid. It can also be seen from the above quotation that this boundary was not only known but also clearly and fully determined, and that there was no disagreement about where the boundary lay.

VIII. The following facts further prove China's acceptance of the 1842 treaty: the other provisions of the treaty regarding the exchange of goods and gifts were enforced until 1946 without any obstruction from the Chinese government.

IX. The claim that the British government proposed a formal demarcation of this border as late as 1899, but that the Chinese government did not agree, is incorrect. There was no suggestion of such a formal demarcation between 1847 and 1899. The British government's proposal in 1899 did not refer to the eastern boundary between Ladakh and Tibet, but to the northern boundary between Ladakh and Kashmir and Xinjiang. It was mentioned in this regard that the northern boundary runs along the Kunlun Mountains to a point east of 80 degrees east longitude, and then joins the eastern boundary of Ladakh. This undoubtedly indicates that the entire Aksai Chin region is within India. The Chinese government did not object to this proposal.

X. Therefore, Ladakh, Tibet, and China have all recognized that the boundary between Ladakh and Tibet is the customary boundary, and you say that the boundary line marked on Chinese maps roughly corresponds to the line marked on the map of "Punjab, Western Himalayas, and the part bordering Tibet" drawn by Walker and attached to Cunningham's book published in 1854. The editorial index of Walker's map states that the reference documents used for this section are "Captain Strachey's map of Ladakh and Ali-Garthson." However, Strachey only traveled in a part of Ladakh in 1847-48. He never went to the Aksai Chin area, so he knew little or nothing about that area. After he drew the line at what he considered to be the main watershed, the natural and old established boundary of this area, the Indian government sent several survey and mapping teams to this area. These teams, based on natural features and available local evidence, ascertained the customary boundary line. Johnson visited this area in 1865; Frederick Drew, a Briton hired by the Maharaja of Kashmir as Governor of Ladakh, also visited this area in 1869. Other survey teams that visited in the 19th century were: Hayward, Shaw and Carey in 1868, Carey in 1885-87, Hamilton-Bower in 1891; Littledale in 1895; Wellby and Malcolm in 1896; Deasy and Pike in 1896; Aurel Stein in 1900. Therefore, it was only from 1865, after the exact location of the watershed was ascertained through the above surveys, that it was possible to draw an accurate map of the entire Ladakh region; and it is significant that most maps published since then have marked the customary line as conforming to the line marked on our maps rather than to the line claimed by China. Later, the map of Turkestan drawn by Walker himself, published in 1867-68, the map attached to Drew's book "The Territories of Jammu and Kashmir" (1875), Johnston's Atlas (1882), and the maps attached to the Kashmir Gazetteer published from 1890 onwards, all show a boundary line roughly similar to our current line. Even the boundary lines drawn on official Chinese maps of the late 19th century are close to our line. It was only on official Chinese maps of the 20th century that the Chinese government marked large tracts of our territory. On the other hand, the "New Atlas and Commercial Gazetteer of China," published sometime after 1917 in Shanghai by the "North China Daily News" based on authoritative surveys, shows a northwest boundary similar to the line we drew, while the northeast boundary is close to the line later known as the McMahon Line. I might add that where Walker's 1854 map does not support the Chinese argument, Chinese maps have not even followed Walker's map. Thus, Walker drew the area north of Demchok and north of Pangong in Indian territory, but recent Chinese maps have not followed Walker's map for these areas.

XI. You mentioned the section of the border between the so-called Ali region of Tibet and India. Ali (which is an abbreviation of Ali-Garthson) is said to be the southwest of Tibet. This is a section of the border between India's Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh and the Tibetan region. You say that this boundary has never been formally demarcated. In fact, there should be no doubt about this boundary. Article 4 of the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement lists six passes within this area. Prior to the signing of the agreement, Chinese and Indian representatives discussed these passes. Your original draft included the following provision: "The Chinese government agrees to open the following passes." At that time, Mr. Kaul, representing India, said that these were Indian passes. After some discussion, both sides agreed to the following provision: "Traders and pilgrims from both sides travel through the following passes." The Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of your country explained this, "This is our fifth concession." This is an acknowledgement that these passes are border passes. In fact, the Indian government has always controlled the Indian end of these passes.

XII. It particularly surprises me that you say "the so-called McMahon Line is a product of British aggression against the Tibet region of China." You also say that the agreement regarding the boundary between India and Tibet was signed between the British representative and the representatives of the local Tibetan authorities, and has never been recognized by any central government of China. From this you conclude that this agreement is illegitimate. However, this is not the case. The arrangements for the Simla Conference were made with the full knowledge and agreement of the Chinese government. The Chinese Foreign Minister wrote to the British representative on August 7, 1913, saying that the Chinese plenipotentiary would go to India to "negotiate a treaty" with the Tibetan and British plenipotentiaries. It is clear from the conference records that not only did the Chinese representative fully participate in this conference, but the Tibetan representative also participated in the discussions on an equal footing with the Chinese representative and the then representative of British India. Not only was the boundary between India and Tibet discussed at the meeting, but also the boundaries between Inner Tibet and China, and between Inner Tibet and Outer Tibet. The Chinese government never objected at any time, then or later, to the discussion of the boundary between India and Tibet at the meeting. In this case, the agreement on the McMahon Line boundary between India and Tibet resulting from the conference must be considered binding on both China and Tibet in accordance with recognized international practice. In fact, this was not the first time that Tibet had concluded agreements with other countries. In 1856, Tibet independently concluded an agreement with Nepal. The treaty signed between Britain and Tibet in 1904 was negotiated by representatives of Britain and Tibet with the assistance of the Chinese Amban in Tibet.

XIII. You say that for a long period after the so-called secret exchange of letters between Britain and Tibet, Britain did not dare to publish the relevant documents. You also say that the McMahon Line was "later marked on the annex to the Simla Treaty." I am afraid I cannot agree with the facts you cite, nor can I agree with your conclusion. The Chinese representative who attended the Simla Conference was fully aware of the McMahon Line boundary between India and Tibet. This specific line was discussed between the Tibetan representative and the representative of British India, but when the draft treaty resulting from the conference was submitted to the representatives of British India, Tibet, and China for signature on April 22, 1914, it was accompanied by a map showing the McMahon Line boundary and the boundaries between Inner Tibet and China and between Inner and Outer Tibet. The Chinese Foreign Ministry later listed many reasons for objecting to the boundaries between Inner and Outer Tibet and between Inner Tibet and China in a memorandum of April 25, 1914. No objection was raised in the memorandum to the boundary line between Tibet and India marked on the annex to the Simla Tripartite Treaty. Thereafter, on April 27, the Chinese representative initialed the treaty and the map without any objection. Later, in a memorandum of June 13, 1914, the Chinese once again put forward new proposals regarding the boundary between Inner and Outer Tibet. It is noteworthy that there was no mention of the boundary between Tibet and India in this memorandum at all. Almost five years later, on May 30, 1919, the Chinese government put forward several amendments to the Simla Treaty in order to reach a final settlement. These amendments only related to the boundary between Inner Tibet and China and between Inner and Outer Tibet. The boundary line between Tibet and India (the McMahon Line) was not mentioned at all. We have consulted old archives and found that the British government did not publish the Simla Treaty for several years in the hope of reaching an agreement on the status and boundary of Inner Tibet. The Simla Treaty was published in the 1929 edition of Aitchison's Treaties, and the McMahon Line has appeared on official maps since 1937. These maps were widely distributed, but no objection was raised by the Chinese authorities at that time or later.

XIV. I completely disagree with the inferences you draw from the two exchanges of letters between the Tibetan Foreign Bureau in Lhasa and the new Indian government in 1947. The fact is that our delegation in Lhasa forwarded to us a telegram from the Tibetan Foreign Bureau dated October 16, 1947. This telegram asked us to return the territory on the Indo-Tibetan border that was referred to as Tibetan territory, "such as the areas in the direction of Tsayu, Walong and Pemakoe, Lona, Lopa, Mon, Bhutan, Sikkim, Darjeeling and other places on this side of the Ganges, and Lowo, Ladakh and other places up to the Yarkand border." It can be seen that the areas claimed by Tibet were not clearly defined. If these areas were understood literally, the Tibetan border would extend to the Ganges River. The Indian government could not have conceived of such an absurd request. If the Indian government had had the slightest consideration that this telegram would become the basis for future claims to large tracts of Indian territory, it would certainly have rejected this request immediately and unequivocally. Since there was no such impression, the Indian government replied as follows: "The Indian government is pleased to have the assurance that the Tibetan government wishes to continue to maintain relations on the existing basis pending the conclusion of new agreements on matters that either side may raise. This is the procedure adopted by India in respect of all other countries with which His Majesty's Government has treaty relations." It would be unfair to conclude from this reply that India was prepared to negotiate new agreements with Tibet on the boundary issue. When Britain relinquished power on August 15, 1947, and India gained freedom, the new Indian government inherited the treaty obligations of pre-partition India. The Indian government was willing to assure all countries with which the British government of pre-partition India had treaty and agreement relations that the new Indian government would abide by the obligations arising from those treaties and agreements. The only thing the Indian government intended to do in the telegram mentioned in Your Excellency's letter was to provide such an assurance to the Tibetan authorities. As far as India is concerned, there is no question of renegotiating old treaties with Tibet in order to consider (even for the sake of discussion) claims to large tracts of Indian territory.

XV. It is wrong to say that the boundary east of Bhutan marked on Chinese maps is the traditional boundary. On the contrary, the McMahon Line correctly represents the customary line in this area. The watershed formed by the crest of the Himalayas is a natural boundary and has been accepted as the boundary by the people of both sides for centuries. The tribes living in the area south of the McMahon Line - the Monba, Aka, Dafla, Miri, Abor and Mishmi - are of the same ethnic origin as the tribes in the Assam hills, and are not related to the Tibetans. The Tibetans themselves despise these tribes, collectively calling them "Lopa." Indeed, the boundary between two neighboring countries is not determined by the ethnic relations of the people living in these two countries. It is not uncommon for there to be some cultural exchange between people living on both sides of the border. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the above-mentioned tribes have not been influenced by Tibetan culture, politics or other aspects in the slightest, and this can only be due to the fact that the Tibetan authorities have never exercised jurisdiction in this area at any time. On the other hand, Indian administration has gradually moved into these areas. Agreements were signed with the Aka people in 1844 and 1888, with the Abor people in 1862-63 and 1866, and with the Monba people in 1844 and 1853, extending the authority of the Indian government to them. The policy of the British government was generally to allow these tribes to take care of themselves more or less, rather than trying to establish the kind of detailed administration in these areas that was seen in other parts of British India. Nevertheless, British political officers have been to this area for the purpose of resolving disputes or other similar purposes. Finally, prior to the Simla Conference, the Sadiya Frontier Tract, covering an area of approximately 10,000 square miles, was formed in 1912, and the Balipara Frontier Tract, covering an area of approximately 10,000 square miles, was formed in 1913. The map of the Qing Empire published by the China Inland Mission in London in 1906 marked the boundary in this area almost identically to the delineation determined at Simla in 1914. This area was extensively surveyed in 1911-1913. The Lohit area was surveyed by the Mishmi Survey in 1911-12, the Dibang Valley in 1912-13 and the Abor area in 1913. Captain Bailey conducted extensive surveys throughout this area in 1913-14 of the southernmost part of the Tibetan jurisdiction. It was on the basis of these detailed materials that the Indo-Tibetan boundary was determined in 1914. Therefore, it is very clear that the McMahon Line was not something arbitrarily imposed on a weak Tibet by the Indian government. It is the formal embodiment of the natural, traditional, ethnic and administrative boundary of this area.

XVI. Your Excellency mentioned a map published by the Survey of India in 1917 and an appendix to the Encyclopedia Britannica in 1929. The Survey of India map marks the line claimed by China, but the index map on the same sheet also marks the McMahon Line. The reason for this is that the British Indian government was unwilling to publish new Indian maps marking only the McMahon Line, hoping that China would accept the entire Simla Treaty. As for the appendix to the Encyclopedia Britannica of 1929, it does roughly mark the line now claimed by China in the east. However, the same map marks the entire Aksai Chin region as part of Ladakh. Therefore, it is unfair to invoke the authority of the Encyclopedia Britannica on one section of the border to support China's claims, while rejecting its authority on another section of the border. In fact, if we want to cite privately published maps from other countries as evidence, we can cite many such maps to support us. For example, the "Map of South Asia" published by Henri Vuillot in Paris in 1876 and the "Map of East Asia" published by the same company in 1881 both marked this entire tribal area as outside Tibet. The map of the Qing Empire published by the China Inland Mission in 1906 marked a boundary very close to the McMahon Line. The map of the Qing Empire published by the British War Office in October 1907 marked almost the entire tribal area in India. The appendix to Sir Francis Younghusband's "India and Tibet" (London, 1910) marked this tribal area in India, as did the appendix to Sir Charles Bell's "Tibet Past and Present" (Oxford, 1924).

XVII. You say that the boundaries of Sikkim and Bhutan are not within the scope of the current discussion, and we are not clear what the exact meaning of this statement is. In fact, Chinese maps mark a considerable area of Bhutan as part of Tibet. Under the treaty relationship with Bhutan, only the Indian government is entitled to negotiate with the governments of other countries on matters relating to Bhutan's foreign relations. In fact, we have negotiated with your government on several issues on behalf of the Bhutanese government, and therefore, the matter of correcting the errors on Chinese maps relating to the boundary between Bhutan and Tibet must be discussed together with the boundary between India and the Tibetan region of China in the same area. As for Sikkim, the Chinese government recognized as early as 1890 that the Indian government "has direct and exclusive control over the internal administration and external relations of that country." The treaty of 1890 also determined the boundary between Sikkim and Tibet; this line was later demarcated in 1895. Therefore, there is no dispute regarding the boundary between Sikkim and the Tibetan region.

XVIII. You say that the Sino-Indian border is approximately 2,000 kilometers long and has not been demarcated in its entirety, and that it is not Chinese maps, but British and Indian maps that unilaterally changed the Sino-Indian border. In fact, the Sino-Indian border (excluding the boundaries of Sikkim and Bhutan with Tibet) is more than 3,520 kilometers long. It is not correct to say that this long border has not been demarcated in its entirety. The boundary east of Bhutan was clearly marked in the appendix to the 1914 treaty. The mention of six passes in the 1954 Agreement implies a clarification of the boundaries of Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. As for the accusation that British and Indian maps unilaterally changed the border, the fact is that the early British maps generally marked the border in the general area where the British at the time believed the watershed to be. Later, as more topographic and local materials were obtained on the watershed, the boundary was marked more accurately on later maps. Part of the reason for the discrepancy between the early and later maps is that British cartographers often marked administrative boundaries on maps regardless of the actual shape of the border. Therefore, as administration gradually extended in the border areas, later maps made corresponding revisions to the boundary. For example, the map of India published by the Survey of India in 1895 (1 inch = 128 miles) colored the unmanaged areas of northern Burma and northeastern India up to what was later called the McMahon Line in light orange to distinguish them from the darker colors used for other parts of Indian territory. A map in Volume II of the Indian Government's Memorandum on Indian Princely States published in 1909 marked this entire tribal area as part of India. In fact, India's existing boundaries have always been historical boundaries, but during the British period, administration was only gradually extended to these boundary lines. Shortly after India gained independence in 1947, the Indian government decided, as a matter of policy, to place these border areas under more direct administrative control so that they could share in the benefits of a welfare state and protect their special social and cultural forms. It is incorrect to say that Indian troops only began to advance step by step in the Northeast Frontier Agency after the recent Tibetan crisis and the entry of a large number of Tibetans into India. In fact, administrative personnel, civil servants and police have been performing their duties in these areas up to the McMahon Line for several years prior to the recent unrest in Tibet. However, we do not have any military forces anywhere in the border areas. Only an armed police force supports the civil servants, and even the border posts are guarded by these police. It was only when the overwhelming Chinese military force overwhelmed our post at Longju and our personnel in other places on the border were intimidated by Chinese troops that we decided to entrust the responsibility of protecting the border to our army.

XIX. From the above paragraphs, it should be clear that it is Chinese maps that have changed the way the border is drawn over the years, marking large tracts of Indian territory as part of China. It should also be stated that even Chinese maps published after 1949 have not followed any established border. Different maps have different ways of drawing the same section of the border.

XX. I must apologize for saying that it is the Chinese government that has been trying to unilaterally change the long-standing status quo of the border. There is no other explanation for why Chinese personnel have appeared in Barahoti, Chinese troops have appeared in the Aksai Chin area, Khurnak Fort, Mandal, Spanggur, Kenzemane and Longju, and Chinese have invaded the areas of Spiti, Shipki Pass, Nilang-Jadhang, Sangza, Lapthal and the Dichu Valley. It is also incorrect to say that Chinese troops have never crossed the McMahon Line. Kenzemane and Longju are both south of this line.

XXI. The Indian government wants to emphatically refute the claim that it has recently "encroached" on some places on the central section of the border. The fact is that Chinese troops have recently been constantly trying to enter and occupy indisputable Indian territory. Details of Chinese troops' intrusions and attempted intrusions are listed in the appendix. In the Spanggur area, this intrusion is particularly noticeable, where Chinese troops have recently been pushing forward aggressively in disregard of the traditional border. The Chinese have also recently established a new camp in an area near the western end of Spanggur Lake, which, even according to some official Chinese maps, is within India. We do not intend to comment on reports of large-scale movements of Chinese troops in the Tibetan border area. We hope that these movements do not mean that a new policy of actively coveting Indian territory along the entire Sino-Indian border will be adopted.

XXII. We have received reports that some Chinese officials in Tibet have repeatedly claimed that the Chinese authorities will soon advance into Sikkim, Bhutan, Ladakh and our Northeast Frontier Agency. I do not know what authority they have to say such things, but I would like to draw Your Excellency's attention to these statements, as they have naturally increased tensions on the border.

XXIII. Your Excellency has spoken of Indian personnel encroaching on Chinese territory. Our personnel have not encroached on Chinese territory anywhere. Even if they did encroach on Chinese territory due to misjudgment in some remote and uninhabited place in certain remote border areas, we would have thought that a friendly government would quickly remind us of this so that it could be corrected. This was not the case. When a group of Indian personnel were conducting a routine administrative patrol near Haji Langar in Ladakh last year, your troops arrested them and did not notify us until we inquired about them almost five weeks later. During this period, our personnel were subjected to threats, rough treatment and severe interrogation, which is certainly not the treatment that personnel of a friendly government should receive.

XXIV. The accusation that India is sheltering Tibetan armed rebels in the Northeast Frontier Agency is completely unfounded, and we firmly reject this accusation. On the contrary, when Tibetan rebels crossed the border into Indian territory, our personnel immediately disarmed them and insisted that they stay away from the border area. For the few who were unwilling to do so, we told them that they could not be sheltered in India and finally let them leave our country.

XXV. The claim that Indian aircraft have repeatedly violated Chinese airspace in this area is not true. We have issued clear instructions to all our aircraft not to enter Chinese airspace. We are confident that they have carefully followed this instruction. However, you can understand that aircraft dropping supplies to border posts may occasionally fly over the international border, or appear to do so but actually not fly over it. Our keen desire to respect Chinese airspace can be clearly seen from the fact that when one of our officers in charge of the Longju post became seriously ill this July, we notified your government that we would airdrop a doctor there. We notified your government so that if our aircraft were to cross into Chinese territory due to misjudgment while flying to the border post, you would not misunderstand. For the same reason, we also notified you in advance that we would be conducting aerial surveys in our airspace on the border from November 1959 to February 1960. Incidentally, the notification we gave you about Longju can also refute any claim that we have secretly established a post on Chinese territory. If we had really done so, we would not have told your government its location.

XXVI. I have investigated the accusation that the border drawn on Indian maps has in many places even included more territory than the McMahon Line, but I have not been able to find any basis for this claim. If you are referring to the fact that the Sino-Indian border marked on Indian maps in the Maktum area is slightly different from the treaty annex, this situation is easy to explain. According to the decision made by the British and Chinese representatives at the Simla Conference, the boundary should follow natural features, but a reservation was made that Maktum (and a few other places) would be marked within Tibet. This was to leave the two sacred lakes of Tsari Sarpa and Chokhar-po in Tibet, as these two places are places of pilgrimage for Tibetans, and the village of Maktum was also left in Tibet, as this is the starting point for pilgrimages. During the Simla Conference, the exact terrain of this area was not yet known. Later, after the exact terrain of this area was ascertained, the actual dividing line was drawn according to the geographical situation, with only one exception due to the fact that Maktum had to be left in Tibet. Therefore, the actual boundary drawn on Indian maps is merely to reflect the treaty annex of this area according to the actual terrain. This is in accordance with established international practice.

XXVII. I cannot fully agree with your view that the tensions occurring on the border are caused by Indian encroachments and provocations. In fact, as shown in the appendix, it is the Chinese who have intruded into Indian territory by crossing the traditional border in some places in recent years. You mentioned that we launched a second so-called anti-China movement in India. If I may say so, this is contrary to the actual situation. Despite the regrettable events on the border between our two countries, we have maintained great restraint and moderation in India, and your troops have taken a threatening attitude in some places and have actually entered our territory in others. These actions involve the integrity of Indian territory and are therefore very serious, but because we are eager to avoid causing resentment towards your government, we have deliberately not publicized these events. However, questions raised in Parliament must be answered. The facts cannot be withheld from publication. When the facts became known in this way, the reaction of Parliament and the public was one of astonishment and extreme anger, and Parliament and the newspapers criticized our government for not publicizing these situations earlier. According to the Indian Constitution, Parliament is supreme. The Indian press is also free, and the government cannot restrict public criticism. In this case, to say that the Indian government is in any way creating pressure on China is a completely erroneous interpretation of the actual situation. This is also based on a completely erroneous understanding of the constitutional procedures by which the Indian government, Parliament and the press operate. Needless to say, this claim is completely unfounded.

XXVIII. I have said in the past and I wish to reiterate that the Indian government attaches great importance to maintaining friendly relations with China. The Indian government has always sought to guide its relations with China and other countries in the spirit of Panchsheel. This has indeed been India's consistent policy, even before the Five Principles were proclaimed. Therefore, it is particularly regrettable and surprising to us that China is now making claims to large tracts of Indian territory inhabited by hundreds of thousands of Indian nationals and which have been under the administrative control of the Indian government for many years. No government can discuss the future of such large areas that constitute their territorial composition. However, we acknowledge that the 3,500-kilometer-long Sino-Indian border has not been demarcated on the ground, and acknowledge that in some places on the traditional border there may be disputes as to whether they are on the Indian side or the Tibetan side of this traditional border line. Therefore, we agree that the border disputes that have already occurred should be resolved amicably and peacefully. We also agree that the status quo should be maintained pending a settlement. At the same time, both sides should respect the traditional border and neither side should attempt to change the status quo in any way. Furthermore, if either side crosses the traditional border and encroaches on the territory of the other side, it should immediately retreat to its own side of the border. As far as the Indian government is concerned, there are currently no Indian civil or military police personnel anywhere on the Tibetan side of the traditional border. There is only one post, the post established at Tamaden a few months ago, which was later found to be slightly north of the McMahon Line after investigation. In accordance with our earlier promise, we have withdrawn that post to a place south of the line. Therefore, there is no question of withdrawing any Indian personnel from any other place. We now request your government, in the same spirit, to withdraw your personnel from the several posts that you have opened in Spanggur, Mandal and one or two places in eastern Ladakh in recent months. Similarly, your troops should withdraw from Longju, which they occupied by force on August 26 and continue to occupy. Negotiations will not be fruitful unless Chinese troops first withdraw from the posts they currently hold on the Indian side of the traditional border and immediately cease further threats and intimidation.

XXIX. Premier, I am sorry that I cannot but write at such length and in such detail, but I must frankly say that your letter of September 8 has shocked us deeply. India was one of the first countries to recognize the People's Republic of China, and for ten years we have consistently strived to maintain and strengthen our friendship with your country. When our two countries signed the 1954 Agreement on the Tibetan Region, I had hoped that the main problems in Sino-Indian relations left to us by history had been peacefully and finally resolved. Five years later, you are now insistently raising a question that makes all the issues we have discussed in recent years, and which I thought had been resolved, seem insignificant. I value your statement that China regards its southwest border as a border of peace and friendship. This hope and guarantee can only be realized if China does not bring the claim

    印度总理尼赫鲁1959年9月26日就中印边界问题给周恩来总理的信
    新华社2日讯　印度总理尼赫鲁1959年9月26日就中印边界问题给周恩来总理写了一封信，全文如下：
    北京
    中华人民共和国总理周恩来先生阁下：
    亲爱的总理先生：
    我已经收到你1959年9月8日的来信。必须说，我读这封信感到非常惊异和伤心。你我曾于1954年在北京，1956年和1957年之交在印度讨论过印中边界、特别是东段的问题。正如你所知道，东段边界泛称为麦克马洪线。我不喜欢这种叫法，但为方便起见，我建议就这样叫它吧！当我同你谈这个问题时，我以为我们面临的问题是就边界东段的所谓麦克马洪线确切位于何处达成协议。甚至在我收到你1959年1月23日的来信的时候，我都没有想到中华人民共和国竟会对在我们看来几十年来无可争辩地属于印度、而某些部分一百多年来就属于印度的约四万平方英里的领土，提出要求。你在最近的来信中，企图对大片的印度领土提出要求，而且甚至暗示说独立的印度政府正在谋求坐收英国侵略中国之利。我国议会和人民对这种说法深为愤慨。印度人民反对国内外任何形式的帝国主义的斗争是全世界都知道和公认的，我们曾以为中国也了解和承认我们的斗争。的确，英国人曾违反印度人民的意愿占领和统治印度次大陆。然而，印度的边界是几世纪以来由历史、地理、习惯和传统解决了的。的确，印度对帝国主义政策的厌恶再没有比在它对西藏的态度中表现得更清楚了。印度政府自愿地放弃了英国在1947年以前在西藏所享有的一切治外法权，并且通过条约承认了西藏是中国的一个地区。在你上次访问印度时我们所进行的长谈中，你对我说，西藏一直是并且仍然是中国的一部分，但它是一个自治区。
    二、你在信中说，印度政府对中国政府施加了种种压力，包括使用武力，来使中国政府接受印度的要求。这是同印度政府所做的相反的。我们并没有公布我们所掌握的关于1954年以来中国人员多次越界侵入我国领土、在拉达克通过印度领土修筑公路和1958年在阿克赛钦地区逮捕和拘留我方人员等问题的情况。我们没有公布这些，是为了希望我们两国能够通过协议和平解决这些争端而不引起双方公众的激动情绪。事实上，我们没有这样做现在已经引起我国议会和报界对政府的尖锐的但是正当的批评。我们不但没有使用武力，而且曾谋求和平解决争端。你一定知道1958年印中代表关于巴拉霍蒂的长期谈判，以及两国政府关于其他争执的来往照会。我用不着告诉你，对于你们的军队用优势压服我们设在麦克马洪线我方一侧的朗久的哨所的行动，印度国内产生了巨大的愤怒；虽然你们至今还没有撤退你们的军队，我们并没有试图重新占领这个哨所。
    三、你提到维持边界久已存在的现状。这是印度政府一向赞成的。是中国政府近年来一再破坏了这一点。譬如，我可以举出下列的例子：通过阿克赛钦地区的印度的传统领土修筑了一条一百英里长的公路；1957年中国测量队进入洛希特边区；1959年在斯潘古尔建立营地；1958年派遣武装人员到巴拉霍蒂并且违反习惯做法冬季在那里驻扎；最后但不是最不关紧要的，在朗久使用了武力。
    四、诚然，中印边界并没有全线正式划定。事实上中印边境许多地方的地形使得这样在地面上用实物标界成为不可能。但是全部边界都是经条约确定，或者由习惯确认，或者两者兼备，到现在为止，中国政府从来没有对印度政府行使管辖权直到习惯边界一点提出过抗议。你自己也承认直到今年年初为止，我们的边界上从来没有发生过武装冲突。历届中国政府都尊重印度的边界。关于这一点的解答并不在于以前的各届中国政府力量弱。甚至连一次也没有按照这方面确立的国家惯例提出过抗议，像在1906年到1937年之间在缅甸问题上曾经做过的那样。
    五、关于西藏和拉达克之间的边界，说当时的中国中央政府没有派任何人参加缔结西藏和克什米尔之间的1842年条约是不正确的。达赖喇嘛和中国皇帝的代表都在条约上签了字。签字人之一的索康喀伦虽然出自藏族，但有着中国的官阶。连条约的藏文本也清楚地表明中国是参加的一方。这样，它说道：“今后将无论如何永不丝毫背离或破坏世界之王赫沙吉大人和巴哈杜尔大君同中国大皇帝和拉萨的古鲁喇嘛之间的同盟、友好和团结。”
    六、1842年条约确实只提到“老的确立的边界”。这是由于这些边界是众所周知的，不需要任何正式的划定。甚至拉达克和西藏之间的1684年条约也说，“当初斯吉德·伊达·聂玛·贡分封他的三个儿子为王时所确定的边界仍应予以维持。”十七世纪的拉达克编年史中的有关材料表明，边界是完全确定了的。阁下曾赞许地提到过的克宁汉在1846年访问过这个地区。他在1854年说，拉达克的东部边界“是由一堆堆的石块清楚标明的，这些石块是在1687年当拉达克人取得克什米尔大量援助把索克坡或蒙古部队最后驱逐出去以后树立起来的。”（“拉达克”，1854年出版，第261页）。因此很清楚，将近两世纪来拉达克和西藏之间的边界是众所周知的并且为双方所承认。在这两个世纪中，根据这些条约的规定，拉达克和西藏之间有着不断的贸易来往，从来没有发生边境冲突。
    七、你的信里说中国从来没有批准1842年条约。中国承认了这个条约可以从这一事实得到证明，就是中国官员在1847年通知英国政府说：“关于边界，请允许我说，这些领土的边界是充分地、清楚地确定下来的，因此，最好遵守这个古老的安排，而且不采取额外的措施来划界将被证明是方便得多的。”没有任何提示说中国政府认为这个条约是无效的。从上面所引的话还可以看出，这一边界不仅是为人所知的，而且也是清楚地和充分地确定了的，并且不存在关于边界在何处的意见分歧。
    八、下列事实进一步证明中国接受了1842年条约，那就是条约中有关交换货物和礼物的其他条款直到1946年还一直在执行，并没有遭到中国政府的任何阻挠。
    九、所谓直到1899年英国政府还曾经建议正式划定这段边界，但是中国政府没有同意的说法，是不正确的。在1847年到1899年间，并没有提出过进行这种正式划界的建议。英国政府在1899年提出的建议不是指拉达克和西藏之间的东部边界，而是指拉达克和克什米尔同新疆的北部边界。在这方面提到，北部边界沿着昆仑山脉直到东经八十度以东的一个点，然后与拉达克东部边界相接。这无可置疑地表明，阿克赛钦全部地区是处在印度境内的。中国政府并没有反对这个建议。
    十、因此，拉达克、西藏和中国都已承认拉达克和西藏之间的边界就是习惯边界，你说中国地图上标明的边界线大致符合于1854年出版的克宁汉的书中所附为瓦克所画的“旁遮普、喜马拉雅山西部以及同西藏接壤部分”图上所标的线。瓦克的图在编辑索引中说明，这一段所用的参考文件是“斯特拉彻上尉的拉达克和阿里噶尔松图”。但是，斯特拉彻在1847到48年只在拉达克的一部分地区旅行过。他从来没有去过阿克赛钦地区，所以对那个地区所知很少或者什么也不知道，他在他认为是主要分水岭的地方，即这个地区的天然和老的确定的边界所在的地方画下了界线以后，印度政府派遣了若干勘察和测量队到这个地区去。这些队以自然特点和能够获得的当地的证据为基础，查明了习惯边界线。1865年约翰逊访问过这个地区；1869年克什米尔土王聘为拉达克总督的英国人弗烈德立克·德鲁也访问过这个地区。十九世纪去过的其他测量队有：1868年海华德、萧和凯利，1885到87年卡里，1891年哈密尔顿·鲍威尔；1895年利特尔戴尔；1896年威尔贝和麦尔柯姆；1896年迪西和派克；1900年奥里尔·斯坦因。因此，只有从1865年，经过上述这些测量查明了分水岭的确切位置以后，才有可能画出整个拉达克地区的准确的地图；而有意义的是：从那时以后出版的大多数地图所标的习惯线都是同我们地图上标明的界线而不是同中国所主张的界线相符的。后来在1867到68年出版的瓦克自己画的土耳其斯坦图、附在德鲁著的“查谟和克什米尔领土”（1875年）书中的地图、约翰斯顿的地图集（1882年）以及从1890年起出版的克什米尔地志的附图所表明的边界线都同我们现在的界线大致相似。即使十九世纪后期的中国官方地图上所画的边界线也接近于我们的线。只是在二十世纪的中国官方地图上，中国政府才把我们的大块领土划了进去。另一方面，1917年以后的某个时候在上海由“字林西报”根据权威的测量而出版的“中国新地图和商业地志”，它所标示的西北边界同我们画的线相似，而东北边界则接近于以后被人们称为麦克马洪线的线。我可以补充一句，在瓦克1854年的地图并不支持中国方面的论点的地方，中国地图甚至没有按照瓦克的地图画。这样，瓦克把碟穆绰克以北和班公以北的地区画在印度境内，但是中国最近的地图对这些地区却没有按照瓦克的地图画。
    十一、你曾提到西藏的所谓阿里地区和印度之间的那段边界。据说阿里（这是阿里噶尔松的缩写形式）是西藏的西南部。这是印度的旁遮普、喜马偕尔省和北方省同西藏地方之间的一段边界。你说这段边界从来没有正式划定。事实上，对这段边界是不应该有什么怀疑的。1954年中印协定第四条列举了在这个地区内的六个山口。在协定签订之前，中国和印度代表曾讨论了这些山口。你方原来的草案中包括下列条文：“中国政府同意开放下列山口”。当时考尔先生代表印度说，这些是印度的山口。经过若干讨论，双方同意下列条文：“双方商人和香客经由下列山口来往”。贵国外交部副部长曾对此说明，“这是我方第五次的让步”。这就是承认这些山口为边界山口。事实上，印度政府一直控制着这些山口的印度一端。
    十二、你说，“所谓的麦克马洪线是英国对中国西藏地方执行侵略政策的产物”，这使我感到特别惊讶。你还说，关于印度和西藏之间的边界的协定是在英国代表和西藏地方当局代表之间签订的，它从未被中国的任何一个中央政府所承认。由此你得出结论说，这个协定是不合法的。然而事实并非如此。西姆拉会议的安排是在中国政府充分知悉和同意的情况下作出的。中国外交部长在1913年8月7日写信给英国代表说，中国的全权代表将前往印度同西藏和英国的全权代表“共开谈判以订立一个条约”。从会议的文件记录可以清楚看出，不仅中国代表充分参加了这一会议，而且西藏代表也是以同中国代表和当时的英属印度代表平等的地位参加了讨论。会上不仅讨论了印度和西藏之间的边界，也讨论了内藏和中国之间、内藏和外藏之间的边界。不论在当时或以后，中国政府并没有在任何时候反对在会上讨论印度和西藏之间的边界。在这种情况下，会议所产生的关于印度和西藏之间的麦克马洪线边界的协定，按照公认的国际惯例，必须被认为对中国和西藏都具有拘束力。事实上，这并不是西藏头一次同别的国家缔结协定。1856年西藏曾经自行同尼泊尔订立了一个协定。英国和西藏在1904年签订的条约，是在中国驻藏大臣的协助下，由英国和西藏的代表商定的。
    十三、你说，在英国和西藏进行了所谓秘密换文以后很长的时期内，英国不敢公布有关文件。你还说，麦克马洪线是“后来标在西姆拉条约的附图之上的”。我怕我不能同意你所举的事实，也不能同意你的结论。参加西姆拉会议的中国代表对印藏之间的麦克马洪线边界是完全知道的。这条具体的线是在西藏代表和英属印度代表之间讨论的，但当会议所产生的条约草案在1914年4月22日提交英属印度、西藏和中国代表签字的时候，曾附有一张标有麦克马洪线边界以及内藏和中国之间和内外藏之间的界线的地图。中国外交部后来在1914年4月25日的一份备忘录中列述了很多反对内外藏之间和内藏和中国之间的界线的理由。对于西姆拉三边条约附图上所标的西藏和印度之间的边界线，备忘录中没有提出任何反对。此后，在4月27日中国代表没有任何反对地草签了条约和地图。以后中国人在1914年6月13日的备忘录中又提出了关于内外藏之间的界线的新的建议。值得注意的是，在这份备忘录中根本没有提到西藏和印度之间的边界。差不多五年以后，在1919年5月30日，中国政府为了获得最后的解决，对西姆拉条约又提出了若干修改。这些修改仅仅涉及内藏和中国之间和内外藏之间的界线。西藏和印度之间的边界线（麦克马洪线）根本没有提及。我们查阅旧档，发现英国政府好几年没有公布西姆拉条约，为的是希望就内藏的地位和界线达成协议，西姆拉条约是在1929年版的艾奇逊条约集上发表的，麦克马洪线是从1937年起在官方的地图上出现的。这些地图是广泛发行的，可是那时或以后中国当局都没有提出过任何异议。
    十四、我完全不同意你从拉萨西藏外交局和印度新政府在1947年的两次交换信件中所得出的推论。事实是这样的：我们驻拉萨的代表团曾转给我们一份西藏外交局1947年10月16日的电报。这封电报要求我们归还印藏边界上的被指称为西藏的领土，“诸如察隅、瓦弄和白马冈方向的地区、洛那、洛巴、门、不丹、锡金、大吉岭和在恒河这一岸的其他各地以及洛窝、拉达克等地直到牙金边界为止”。可以看出，西藏所要求的地区并没有明确范围。如果按字面来了解这些地区，西藏边界就会一直伸到恒河一线。印度政府是不可能设想这样一个荒诞的要求的。如果印度政府曾有丝毫考虑认为这份电报会成为日后要求取得印度的大块领土的根据的话，当然会立刻毫不含糊地拒绝这一要求。由于没有这样一种印象，因而印度政府答复如下：“印度政府乐于得到保证，西藏政府愿在就任何一方可能提出的事项达成新的协议以前继续维持现有基础上的关系。这是印度继承英王陛下政府与之有条约关系的所有其他国家所采取的程序”。如果从这个答复中得出结论，认为印度准备就边界问题同西藏谈判新的协议的话，这是不公平的。当1947年8月15日英国放弃权力和印度获得自由以后，新的印度政府继承了印度未分裂前的条约义务。印度政府愿意向与未分裂前的印度的英国政府有条约和协定关系的一切国家保证，新的印度政府将恪守这些条约和协定所产生的义务。印度政府在阁下来信中所提到的电报中所想做的唯一的事情就是向西藏当局提出这样的保证。就印度而言，不存在重新同西藏谈判老的条约，以便考虑（即使为了讨论的目的）对印度大块领土的要求的问题。
    十五、如果说中国地图所标明的不丹以东的界线就是传统的边界，那是错误的。正相反，麦克马洪线才正确地代表着这个地区的习惯线。由喜马拉雅山顶形成的分水岭是自然的界线，几世纪来它已为双方人民接受为边界。居住在麦克马洪线以南地区的部落——门巴、阿卡、达夫拉、米里、阿波尔和米希米——是和阿萨姆山区各部落属于同样的种源的，而和西藏人没有亲属关系。西藏人自己是轻视这些部落的，把他们合称为“洛巴”。的确，两个邻国的界线不是由居住在这两国国家里的人的种族关系所决定的。居住在边界双方的人民间有某种文化来往，这也不是稀有的事。尽管如此，值得注意的是，上述那些部落丝毫没有受到西藏文化、政治或其他方面的影响，而这只能是由于西藏当局在任何时候都没有在这个地区行使管辖权。另一方面，印度的行政管理逐渐移入这些地区。在1844年和1888年同阿卡人，在1862年—63年和1866年同阿波尔人，在1844年和1853年同门巴人，都签订了协定，把印度政府的权力扩及到他们身上。英国政府的政策一般是或多或少地让这些部落自己照顾自己。而不是试图对这些地区建立像在英属印度的其他部分所见到的那种周详的管理。尽管如此，英国政治官员们来过这个地区，为了解决纠纷或者其他类似目的。最后，在西姆拉会议前，在1912年形成了面积约一万平方英里的萨地亚边区，在1913年形成了面积也约一万平方英里的巴利帕拉边区。1906年中国内地会在伦敦出版的大清帝国舆图在这个地区标明的边界，同1914年在西姆拉确定的划法几乎一致。这个地区在1911—1913年曾经广泛的测量过。洛希特地区在1911—12年由米希米调查团进行了测量，迪邦河谷在1912—13年和阿波尔地区在1913年也进行了测量。1913—14年贝利上尉在这整个地区对西藏管辖所及的极南部分进行了广泛的测量，就是在这些详细的材料的基础上，才在1914年确定了印藏边界。因此很清楚，麦克马洪线并不是印度政府任意强加在弱小的西藏头上的东西。它是这个地区的自然的、传统的、种族的和行政的界线的正式体现。
    十六、阁下提到1917年印度测量局出版的一幅地图和1929年大英百科全书的一幅附图，印度测量局的地图标明了中国所主张的线，但是在同一张图纸上的索引图上，也标明了麦克马洪线。其原因是英属印度政府不愿发布只标明麦克马洪线的新的印度地图，而希望中国会接受整个西姆拉条约。至于1929年大英百科全书的附图，确实在东段粗略地标明了中国现在所主张的线。但是，同一张地图把整个阿克赛钦地区划作拉达克的一部分。因此，在一段边界上引用大英百科全书的权威来支持中国的主张，而在另一段边界上则又排斥它的权威，这是不公平的。事实上，如果要引用其他国家私人出版的地图作为证据的话，我们可以举出很多这种地图来支持我们。例如，1876年巴黎昂德里伏·古戎出版的“南亚图”和1881年同一家公司出版的“东亚图”都把这整个部落地区划在西藏之外。1906年中国内地会出版的大清帝国舆图所标的边界和麦克马洪线很接近。1907年10月英国陆军部出版的大清帝国图几乎把整个部落地区划在印度。1910年在伦敦出版的弗兰西斯·荣赫鹏爵士所著“印度和西藏”一书的附图把这个部落地区划在印度；查尔斯·贝尔爵士的“西藏的过去和现在”一书（牛津，1924年）的附图也是这样标明的。
    十七、你说锡金和不丹的边界不属于目前讨论的范围，我们不清楚，这句话的确切含义是什么。事实上，中国地图把相当大块的不丹地区划作西藏的一部分。根据同不丹的条约关系，只有印度政府有权可以就有关不丹对外关系的事项向其他国家的政府进行交涉。事实上，我们已经代表不丹政府就若干问题向贵国政府进行过交涉，因此，修改中国地图上有关不丹和西藏边界的错误一事必须同印度和中国西藏地方在同一地段的边界一起加以讨论。至于锡金，中国政府早在1890年就承认印度政府“对该国的内部管理和对外关系有着直接的和排他的控制权”。1890年的这个条约也确定了锡金和西藏之间的边界；这条线后来在1895年加以标定。因此，关于锡金同西藏地方的边界，不存在任何纠纷。
    十八、你说中印边界全长约二千公里，全部没有划定，并说不是中国地图，而是英国和印度的地图片面地改变了中印边界。事实上，中印边界（锡金和不丹与西藏的边界除外）有三千五百二十多公里长。说这么长的边界全部没有划定是不对的。不丹以东的边界在1914年条约附图中已明确划出。1954年协定中提到六个山口一事意味着澄清了喜马偕尔省和北方省的边界。至于所谓英、印地图片面地改变了边界的指责，事实是，早期的英国地图是把边界大体标在当时英国人认为分水岭所在的地方。后来，由于对分水岭获得了更多的地形的和当地的材料，边界就在后来的地图上更加精确地标了出来。早期和后期地图之间有出入，其部分的原因还在于英国制图家往往不管边界的实际形状而在地图上标出行政的界线。因此，随着行政管理在边境地区逐渐伸展出去，后来的地图就对边界作了相应的修改。如1895年印度测量局出版的印度地图（1英寸＝128英里）把迄至后来所称的麦克马洪线的缅甸北部和印度东北部无人管理地区，涂上了浅桔色，以别于印度领土其他部分所用的较深的颜色。印度政府1909年发表的关于印度土邦的备忘录第二卷中有一幅地图，标明这整个部落地区是印度的一部分。事实上，印度的现有边界一直是历史上的边界，不过在英国人时期，行政管理只是逐渐地扩及到这些边界线去的。印度在1947年获得独立后不久，印度政府决定，作为一项政策，把这些边境地区放在更直接的行政管辖之下，以使它们能够分享到一个福利国家的利益，并使他们的特殊的社会和文化型式得到保护。如果说只是在最近发生西藏危机和大批藏人进入印度以后，印度军队才开始在东北边境特区节节进逼，那是不正确的。事实上，行政人员、文职人员和警察在最近西藏爆发骚乱之前，几年来就一直在直到麦克马洪线为止的这些地区中行使职责。然而，在边界地区任何地方，我们并没有任何军事力量。只有一支武装警察支持文职人员，甚至边境哨所也是由这些警察守卫的。只是在占优势的中国军事力量压倒了我们在朗久的哨所和我们在边界上其他地方的人员受到中国军队的恫吓的时候，我们才决定把保护边界的责任交给我们的陆军。
    十九、从上面各段的叙述中，应该可以看清，多少年来，是中国的地图改变了边界的画法，把大片印度领土划入了中国境内。还应该说明，甚至在1949年以后出版的中国地图也没有遵照任何确定的边界。不同的地图对同一段边界有不同的画法。
    二十、我不得不抱歉地说，是中国政府一直在企图片面改变边界久已存在的状况。没有别的解释可以说明为什么中国人员出现在巴拉霍蒂，中国军队出现在阿克赛钦地区、库尔那克堡、曼达尔、斯潘古尔、兼则马尼和朗久以及中国人侵入司丕提地区、什布奇山口、尼兰—贾德汗地区、香扎、拉不底和狄丘山谷。如果说中国军队从未越过麦克马洪线，那也是不正确的。兼则马尼和朗久都在这条线以南。
    二十一、印度政府要着重批驳所谓它近来“侵占了”中段边界的一些地方的说法。事实是中国军队近来不断力图进入和占据无可争辩的印度领土。中国军队侵入和企图侵入的详情列举在附件中。在斯潘古尔地区，这种侵入特别显著，在那里，中国军队最近一两年来不顾传统的边界以咄咄逼人的姿态向前推进。中国人最近还在斯潘古尔湖的西端附近的一个地方建立了一个新的营地，而那个地方，即使根据某些官方的中国地图，也是在印度境内的。我们不打算评论中国军队在西藏边境地区进行大规模调动的报道。我们希望这些调动并不意味着要采取一种在中印边界全线向印度领土积极窥伺的新政策。
    二十二、我们接到报告说，在西藏的某些中国官员屡次宣称中国当局不久将进占锡金、不丹、拉达克和我国的东北边境特区。我不知道他们有什么权力来说这种话，但是我愿提请阁下注意这种说法，因为它们已自然地增加了边境的紧张局势。
    二十三、阁下曾谈到印度人员侵越中国领土。我们的人员没有在任何地方侵越过中国领土。即使他们在某些偏远边区荒无人烟的某个地点，由于判断错误而侵越了中国的领土，我们原以为一个友好的政府会迅速提醒我们注意，以便进行纠正。事实不然，当去年一批印度人员在拉达克的哈吉拦干附近进行例行的行政巡逻时，你们的军队把他们逮捕起来，直到差不多五个星期以后我们向你们查询时，才通知我们。在此期间，我们的人员曾遭到威胁、粗暴的待遇和严厉的讯问，这当然不是一个友好政府的人员所应受到的待遇。
    二十四、对于印度在东北边境地区包庇西藏武装叛乱分子的指控是完全没有根据的，我们坚决拒绝这种指控。相反地，当西藏叛乱分子越界进入印度领土时，我方人员立即解除了他们的武装，并且坚持要他们远离边境地区。对少数不愿意这样做的人，我们便告诉他们不能在印度得到庇护，最后让他们离开了我国。
    二十五、关于印度飞机一再侵犯这个地区的中国领空的说法并非事实。我们向我国所有的飞机发出了明确的指示，不得越入中国的领空。我们确信他们谨慎地遵守了这个指示。然而，你可以理解，向边界哨所空投供应物资的飞机可能偶然飞过国际边界，或者看起来似乎是这样而实际上并没有飞过去。我们尊重中国领空的迫切心情可以从这样一件事实清楚地看出来：今年7月我们在朗久哨所的一个负责官员得了重病，我们曾通知贵国政府我们将在那里空投一位医生。我们通知贵国政府的目的是，如果我国飞机在飞往边界哨所时由于判断错误而越入中国领土，你们不至于误会。为了同样的原因，我们也曾事先通知你们，从1959年11月到1960年2月这几个月内将在边界的我方领空进行航测。附带可以指出，我们给你们的关于朗久的通知，也可以驳倒任何认为我们在中国领土上偷设哨所的说法。如果我们真的这样作了，我们就不会把它的位置告诉贵国政府了。
  二十六、我调查了所谓在印度地图上画的边界在很多地方甚至划入了比麦克马洪线还要多的领土的指责，但是我没有能够发现这种说法有任何根据。如果你所指的是印度地图上在马及墩地区所标的中印边界同条约附图稍有不同，这种情况是容易解释的。根据西姆拉会议时英国和中国代表作出的决定，边界应遵循自然的特点，但是作了一项保留，即马及墩（和其他少数几处地方）将划在西藏境内。这是为了要把杂里·萨尔巴和左喀尔坡两个圣湖留在西藏，因为这两个地方是西藏人朝圣的地方，马及墩村也留在西藏，因为这是朝圣的启程点。在西姆拉会议期间，人们还不知道这个地区的确切地形。后来，在确切查明这个地区的地形以后，实际分界线是按照地理形势画的，只有一处由于要把马及墩留在西藏境内而出现例外的情况。因此，印度地图上画的实际界线只不过是根据确实的地形来体现这个地区的条约附图。这是符合于既定的国际惯例的。
    二十七、我完全不能同意你的看法，即认为边境上发生的紧张局势是由于印度人越境和挑衅而引起的。事实上，如附件所示，是中国人近年来在一些地方越过传统边界侵入了印度的领土。你提到我们在印度发动了第二次的所谓反华运动。如果我可以这样说的话，这是同实际情况相反的。尽管在我们两国的边界上发生了令人遗憾的事件，我们在印度一直保持了极大的克制和温和的态度，你们的军队在若干地方采取了威胁的态度，而在另外一些地方实际上进入了我国的领土。这些行动涉及印度领土的完整，因此是非常严重的，但是由于我们亟愿避免造成对贵国政府的愤慨情绪，我们故意没有公布这些事件。然而，议会中提出的问题必须给予答复。事实不能扣住不发表。当事实这样为大家所了解以后，议会和公众的反应是惊异和亟大的愤怒，议会和报纸都批评我国政府没有更早地把这些情况公布出来。按照印度宪法，议会是至高无上的。印度的报纸也是自由的，政府不能限制公众的批评。在这种情况下，说印度政府以任何方式制造对中国的压力，那是对实际情况的完全错误的解释。这也是基于对印度政府、议会和报纸所据以行事的宪法程序的完全错误的了解。不用说，这种说法是完全没有根据的。
    二十八、我过去已经说过。现在愿再次声明，印度政府十分重视同中国维持友好关系。印度政府一直力图本着潘查希拉的精神来指导它同中国和其他国家之间的关系。这的确是印度一贯的政策，即使在宣布五项原则以前也是这样。因此，中国现在居然对居住着成千成万的印度国民，而且多年来一直受印度政府的行政管辖的大块印度领土提出要求，这是特别使我们感到遗憾和惊奇的。没有一个政府可能就这些构成它们领土组成部分的这样大块的地区的前途进行讨论。然而我们承认长达三千五百多公里的印中边界线并没有在地面上标定，并承认在传统边界上的某些地方可能发生究竟是处在这条传统边界线的印度方面还是西藏方面的争执。因此我们同意已经发生的边界纠纷应该友好地、和平地加以解决。我们也同意，在达成解决以前，现状应予维持。同时双方都应该尊重传统边界，任何一方都不得试图以任何方式改变现状。此外，如果任何一方越过传统边界侵入另一方的领土时，应当立刻退回到边界的自己一侧。就印度政府而言，目前在传统边界的西藏这边的任何地方都没有印度的任何文职或军警人员。只有一个哨所，就是几个月以前在塔马顿建立的哨所，这个地方经过后来调查证明是处在麦克马洪线稍北一点。遵照我们早先的诺言，我们已经将该哨所撤到该线以南的一个地方。因此不存在从其他任何地方撤退任何印度人员的问题。我们现在请求贵国政府根据同样的精神从你们最近几个月在斯潘古尔、曼达尔和在拉达克东部的一两个地方开设的若干哨所撤回你们的人员。同样地，你们的军队也应该撤出他们在8月26日用武力占领了的并且现在还继续占领着的朗久。除非中国军队先从他们目前在传统边界的印度这边据有的哨所撤出，并且立刻停止进一步的威胁和恐吓，谈判是不会有成效的。
    二十九、总理先生，我很抱歉，不能不写得这样长、这样详细，然而我必须坦率地说，你9月8日的信使我们十分震惊。印度是首先承认中华人民共和国的国家之一，十年来我们一贯努力维护和加强同贵国的友谊。当我们两国签订关于西藏地方的1954年协定时，我曾希望历史遗留给我们的印中关系中的主要问题已经和平地和最终地获得了解决。五年之后，你现在却坚持地提出了这样一个问题，它使近年来我们讨论过而我以为已经解决了的一切问题显得微不足道。我重视你提出的关于中国把它的西南边界看作是和平和友好的边界的声明。这个希望和保证，只有在中国不把对一直是印度领土组成部分的几千平方英里的土地的要求扯到本质上属于边境纠纷的范围内来的情况下，才能够得到实现。
    致亲切的问候。
