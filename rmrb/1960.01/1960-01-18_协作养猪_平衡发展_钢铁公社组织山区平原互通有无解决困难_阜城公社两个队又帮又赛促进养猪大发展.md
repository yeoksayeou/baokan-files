Cooperative Pig Raising, Balanced Development
	The Iron and Steel People's Commune organizes mutual assistance between mountainous and plain areas to solve difficulties.
	The Yucheng Commune's two teams help and compete to promote great development in pig raising.
	(Reported by this newspaper) The Iron and Steel People's Commune in Gushi County, Henan Province, in its great development of the pig raising industry, organizes cooperation between major brigades, providing mutual assistance in pig sources, pastures, funds, feed, and materials for building pig farms, and jointly develops. Now this commune has a total of 87,600 pigs, an increase of 5.9 times over the same period last year, reaching an average of two pigs per person and more than one pig per mu of land.
	The Iron and Steel Commune has a total of eighteen brigades, of which seven teams are in the plains and eleven teams are in the hilly areas. In the past, the development of pig raising in these teams was extremely unbalanced. At the end of 1958, the Guanmiao and other three brigades in the plain area had an average of one pig per two mu of land; the Shili Jingzi and other eight brigades in the hilly area had an average of one pig per ten mu of land. In the spring of 1959, the commune Party committee, based on this imbalance, convened a meeting of branch secretaries and team leaders from major brigades to discuss pig raising cooperation. Through presenting the facts and reasoning, everyone unanimously agreed that to achieve high-speed pig raising, there must be extensive cooperation. For example, the Guanmiao Brigade, which had a good foundation in pig raising and was relatively affluent, could not buy bamboo poles or timber for building pig farms, while the Dapeng and Huaiyan brigades, which were relatively poor and lacked a pig raising foundation, had relatively ample pastures and many bamboo poles. If they supported each other, both sides would benefit.
	In order to strengthen leadership over cooperation, the commune Party committee formed a cooperation committee headed by the Party committee secretary, including branch secretaries from major brigades. After full discussion, the committee established three cooperation methods: ① Brigades with a better foundation in pig raising should support other brigades with sows and piglets at a price, to be repaid when the supported brigade sells fat pigs; hilly areas should support plain areas with bamboo poles, timber, etc., at a price to be repaid in installments. ② Funds provided by affluent teams to poor teams should be repaid in installments as pigs continue to develop. ③ Labor and vehicles used in mutual support between major brigades should be paid wages by the benefiting team. In addition to organizing mutual cooperation between major brigades, the commune Party committee also bought more than 200 high-quality breeding pigs from other places, established a breeding farm, and distributed the bred piglets to various teams for raising. It also transferred 76 carpenters and 36 blacksmiths from various teams to help each team build pigpens and reform tools.
	In the great development of the pig raising industry, the commune first uniformly solved the problem of the lack of pig sources in teams with a poor foundation. The cooperation committee transferred 1,300 sows and 2,000 piglets from Guanmiao, Dazhai, and other nine teams with many sows to support teams lacking pig sources. The Wuliangsi Brigade is close to the river, has historically raised few pigs, and has a lot of sandy land, resulting in low yields due to a lack of fertilizer. Teams with more pigs proposed to help Wuliangsi transform sandy land into black sandy land and supported this team with more than 100 sows and piglets, enabling this team to develop pig raising to more than 3,800 pigs in one year, averaging one pig per mu of land. The Dazhai Team has many pigs and is a hemp producing area, and is relatively affluent. Seeing that Shili Jingzi was having difficulty raising pigs, it lent 2,300 yuan to Shili Jingzi. The Dapeng Brigade increased its pigs but had no pasture. The neighboring Huaiyan Brigade allocated its 50 mu of lush aquatic plants at Taoping Lake to the Dapeng Team as pasture. Due to the abundance of pigs and fertilizer, yields caught up with the affluent teams in one year.
	With the large-scale development of pigs, major brigades in the plain area had to build large pig farms and lacked materials such as timber and bricks. At this time, the hilly areas proposed to support whatever the plains lacked. The Dapeng, Chenmiao, and other brigades supported the Yangwan and Wuliangsi brigades with the team's kilns; Wuliangsi, which Guanmiao had originally supported, took the initiative to support Guanmiao with 1,000 jin of bamboo and wood and 600 sunflower stalks.
	Teams with poor original foundations lacked pig raising experience and lacked epidemic prevention knowledge. In addition to sending good veterinarians to those teams, the commune, through the cooperation committee, systematically organized veterinary personnel to conduct commune-wide epidemic prevention work and established six pig hospitals and thirty-one epidemic prevention stations. Sun Chuanfa, a veterinarian from the Guanmiao Brigade, upon hearing that the Wuliangsi Brigade had fifty or sixty sick pigs, took the initiative to help with treatment.

	(Reported by this newspaper) The Huangzhuang Production Team and the Duowangcun Production Team of the Yucheng Commune in Jiahe County, Hebei Province, launched a pig raising joint competition, learning from each other and cooperating with each other, promoting the rapid development of the pig raising industry.
	Both of these production teams have certain favorable conditions and certain difficulties in developing pig raising production. Duowangcun is relatively affluent, has funds to develop pig raising on a large scale, and has pig raising experience, but lacks bricks and stones for repairing pens and technical personnel for purchasing pig seedlings; Huangzhuang has poor economic conditions, insufficient funds, and less pig raising experience, but has many old bricks that cannot be used and two technical personnel who can purchase breeding pigs. If these two teams do not join hands, it will be difficult for them to develop the pig raising industry. In August 1959, under the encouragement of the great development of pig raising, the two teams launched a joint competition. Duowangcun provided funds, and Huangzhuang provided bricks, so that both sides' difficulties with pig seedlings and pig pens were solved. Huangzhuang lacked pig raising experience, and some pigs were sick and weak. Duowangcun took the initiative to send experienced pig raising experts to help improve feeding management and took out some concentrated feed to feed the sick pigs. After more than ten days of help, the sick pigs got better, and the weak pigs became stronger. From August 1959 to the present, after four months of joint competition, the pigs in both teams have increased rapidly. Huangzhuang has increased from the original twelve pigs to one hundred and seventy-eight pigs, reaching two point three pigs per person, and Duowangcun has developed from the original two pigs to one hundred and eighty-six pigs, reaching one pig per person.
	In the early stages of the competition, some people in the relatively affluent Duowangcun Team were afraid of suffering losses; some people in the Huangzhuang Team also had the idea of relying on outside teams for help. After a discussion, the two teams realized that carrying out a joint competition in pig raising production was for the purpose of common improvement; helping others before oneself and supporting each other was beneficial to both teams. Hu Shuqin, a member of the relatively affluent Duowangcun Team, said: "Now that we are in a commune, brother teams should unite closely and help each other. Although our team's conditions are better, we can't do everything without asking for help." Members of the Huangzhuang Team also realized that they should, in the spirit of self-reliance, try their best to find their own solutions and should not simply rely on outside team support. A new situation of comparing, catching up, surpassing, and helping quickly emerged in the two teams.
	After the competition started, the two teams constantly visited each other, exchanged experiences, and learned from each other's strengths to make up for their weaknesses. They successively exchanged experiences in epidemic prevention, breeding, etc., so that the feeding management of pigs was continuously improved; they regarded each other's difficulties as their own and immediately helped to solve them. In order to strengthen the leadership of the two teams' competition, the management area established a special guidance group, stipulating that there would be an inspection every three days, an evaluation every ten days, and regular rewards, so that the joint competition became more and more in-depth.

    协作养猪　平衡发展
    钢铁公社组织山区平原互通有无解决困难
    阜城公社两个队又帮又赛促进养猪大发展
    本报讯　河南固始县钢铁人民公社，在养猪业大发展中，组织各大队协作，在猪源、牧场、资金、饲料、建猪场材料等方面互通有无，共同发展。现在这个社共有猪八万七千六百多头，比去年同期增长五点九倍，达到每人平均两头猪，每亩地一头多猪。
    钢铁公社共有十八个大队，其中有七个队在平原地区，十一个队在丘陵地区，过去这些队养猪业发展极不平衡。1958年年底，平原地区的官庙等三个大队，每二亩地平均一头猪；丘陵地区的十里井子等八个大队，平均十亩地一头猪。1959年春，公社党委根据这种不平衡情况，召开各大队支部书记、队长会议，讨论养猪协作问题。通过摆事实，讲道理，大家一致认为要实现高速度养猪，一定要大协作。如养猪基础较好而又比较富足的官庙大队，建猪场买不到竹竿、木料，而比较穷又没养猪基础的大棚、淮堰等大队却有比较宽裕的牧场，竹竿也很多，如果互相支援，双方都有好处。
    公社党委为了加强对协作的领导，以党委书记为首吸收各大队支部书记成立协作委员会。委员会经过充分讨论，定出三条协作办法：①养猪基础较好的队支援别队的母猪、仔猪，一律作价，被支援队出卖肥猪时即行归还；丘陵区支援平原区的竹竿、木料等，应作价分期归还。②富队支援穷队的资金，应随着猪的不断发展分期归还。③各大队互相支援中用的人工、车辆，由受益队照付工资。公社党委除了组织各大队互相协作之外，还从外地买来优良种猪二百多头，建立良种繁殖场，繁殖的仔猪分给各队饲养。又从各队抽调七十六个木匠、三十六个铁匠，帮助各队建猪圈和改革工具。
    在养猪业大发展中，公社首先统一解决了基础较差的队缺少猪源的问题。协作委员会从官庙、大寨等九个母猪多的队，调出一千三百头母猪、二千头仔猪，支援缺猪源的队。无量寺大队紧靠河边，历年养猪少，黄沙地多，因缺肥产量低。养猪多的队提出要帮助无量寺变黄沙地为黑沙地，支援了这个队一百多头母猪和仔猪，使这个队一年之间养猪发展到三千八百多头，平均一亩地有一头猪。大寨队养猪多，又是产麻区，比较富裕，看到十里井子养猪困难，便拿出二千三百元借给十里井子。大棚大队猪增加了，没有牧场，邻近的淮堰大队把自己五十亩水草丰盛的桃平湖地拨给大棚队当牧场。由于猪多肥多，产量一年赶上了富队。
    猪只大量发展，平原区各大队都要大建猪场，缺乏木料、砖瓦等材料，这时丘陵区便提出平原缺啥支援啥。大棚、陈庙等大队，把队里的瓦窑支援给杨湾、无量寺大队；原来官庙支援过的无量寺，主动支援官庙一千斤竹木、六百根葵花秆。
    原来基础差的队没有养猪经验，缺少防疫知识，公社除了把好兽医派到那些队以外，协作委员会有计划的组织兽医人员进行全社性的防疫工作，并建立六个猪医院、三十一个防疫站。官庙大队兽医孙传发，听到无量寺大队病了五、六十头猪，主动去帮助治疗。
    本报讯　河北交河县阜城公社黄庄生产队和多王村生产队，开展养猪携手赛，互相学习，互相协作，促进了养猪事业迅速发展。
    这两个生产队，在发展养猪生产中，都具有一定的有利条件，也都有一定的困难。多王村比较富裕，大量发展养猪有资金，有养猪经验，但缺少修圈的砖石和采购猪秧的技术人员；黄庄经济条件较差，资金不足，养猪经验也少，但有很多旧砖用不了，还有两名可以采购种猪的技术人员。这两个队如果不携起手来，发展养猪业都有困难。1959年8月两个队在养猪大发展形势的鼓舞下，掀起了携手竞赛。多王村垫出资金，黄庄拿出砖，使双方猪秧、猪圈的困难都得到解决。黄庄缺乏养猪经验，有的猪有病体弱，多王村主动派养猪有经验的能手去帮助改进饲养管理，并拿出一部分精饲料喂养病猪，经过十几天的帮助，病猪变好，弱猪变强。从1959年8月到目前，经过四个月的携手竞赛，两队猪都迅速增加，黄庄已由原来的十二头猪增加到一百七十八头，达到每人二点三头，多王村由原来两头猪发展到一百八十六头，达到一人一猪。
    在竞赛初期，较富的多王村队曾经有一部分人怕吃亏；黄庄队也有的人存在依赖外队帮助的思想。两个队经过座谈，认识到在养猪生产中开展携手赛，是为了共同提高；先人后己，互相支援，对两队都有利。比较富裕的多王村队社员胡淑琴说：“公社化了，兄弟队应当亲密团结，互相帮助。咱队虽然条件较好，也不是万事不求人。”黄庄队的社员也认识到应该本着自力更生的精神，尽量自己想办法，不应该单纯依靠外队支援。两个队迅速出现了比、赶、超、帮的新局面。
    竞赛开展起来以后，两个队不断地互相参观，交流经验，取长补短。先后交流了防疫、配种等经验，使猪只的饲养管理不断地得到改善；发现对方的困难，看成是自己的困难，立即帮助解决。为了加强两队竞赛的领导，管理区成立了专门的指导小组，规定三天一检查，十天一评比，定期奖励，使携手赛越来越深入。
