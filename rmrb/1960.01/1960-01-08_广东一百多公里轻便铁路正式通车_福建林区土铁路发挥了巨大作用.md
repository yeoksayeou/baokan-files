    Guangdong's more than 100 Kilometers of Light Railways Officially Open to Traffic
    Fujian's Forest Area's Indigenous Railways Play a Huge Role

    (Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 7th dispatch) Guangdong Province is actively building small modern railways. In 1959, the province completed and opened seven narrow-gauge light railways, totaling 111 kilometers. The 20 small locomotives and 190 vehicles running on these railways were also manufactured through the collaboration of railway departments and dozens of factories.

    Most of the seven light railways built in Guangdong Province this year are located in mountainous areas, including six dedicated lines for coal mines and one dedicated line for forests. In the past, these mountainous areas suffered from insufficient short-distance transportation capacity, resulting in large stockpiles of coal and timber that could not be transported out in time. The construction of these light railways has connected coal and timber producing areas with long-distance transportation lines such as railway trunk lines and shipping routes. According to the designed transportation capacity, these seven light railways have an annual transportation volume of 4 million tons, with transportation costs reduced by more than half compared to automobiles, playing a significant role in developing coal and timber production and supporting industrial and agricultural production.

    Party committees at all levels in Guangdong Province attach great importance to the construction of light railways and the manufacturing of locomotives and vehicles. Under the direct leadership of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, a provincial railway construction committee was established, with a responsible comrade of the provincial committee personally taking charge, specifically leading and uniformly arranging railway construction work throughout the province. Strengthening the Party's leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, and especially strengthening political and ideological work among the laborers, and organizing communist large-scale collaboration throughout the province, played a significant role in ensuring the smooth progress of construction and manufacturing work.

    (Based on a report) While constructing the Yingxia, Nanfu, Zhanglong, and Zhangquan railway trunk lines, Fujian Province has also built more than 200 kilometers of small modern railways in forest and factory and mining areas, of which 105 kilometers have been completed and opened to traffic.

    The opening of these light railways has played a huge role in promoting forestry and industrial and agricultural production. In the forest farms in Fujian Province where light railways have been built, more than 90% of the timber transportation tasks are completed by small trains. The 26-kilometer light railway of Xianyou Sugar Factory connects the sugar factory with the sugarcane production area, and most of the sugarcane transportation is handled by small trains.

    广东一百多公里轻便铁路正式通车
    福建林区土铁路发挥了巨大作用
    本报广州7日电　广东省积极建设小洋铁路。1959年全省已建成通车的窄轨距轻便铁路有七条，共一百一十一公里；在这些铁路上奔驰的小机车二十台和车辆一百九十辆，也是组织铁路部门和几十家工厂协作制造的。
    广东省今年建成的七条轻便铁路大多数分布在山区，其中有六条是煤矿专用线，一条是森林专用线。过去，这些山区由于短途运输力量不足，积存大量煤炭和木材不能及时运出。建成这些轻便铁路，就使得煤炭、木材产地与铁路干线、航运干流等长途运输线连接起来。按照设计运输能力，这七条轻便铁路每年运输量达四百万吨，运费较汽车降低一半以上，对发展煤炭、木材生产，支援工农业生产起了重大作用。
    广东省各级党委对修建轻便铁路和制造机车车辆的工作十分重视，在中共广东省委直接领导下，成立了省的铁路修建委员会，并由省委负责同志亲自挂帅，具体领导并统一安排全省铁路修建工作。由于加强了党的领导，坚持了政治挂帅，特别是加强了民工中的政治思想工作，和组织了全省规模的共产主义大协作，对保证修建、制造工作顺利进行起到重大作用。
    本报讯　福建省在修建鹰厦、南福、漳龙、漳泉等铁路干线的同时，又在林区和厂矿区兴建二百多公里小洋铁路，其中一百零五公里已经建成通车。
    这些轻便铁路的通车，对促进林业和工农业生产起了巨大作用。福建省已经建成轻便铁路的林场，90％以上的木材运输任务都是由小火车完成的。仙游糖厂二十六公里轻便铁路把糖厂与甘蔗产区联结起来，甘蔗运输大部分由小火车负担。
