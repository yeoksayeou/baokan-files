The Party Branch of the Minzu Road Service Cooperative in Chongqing Deeply Conducts Ideological Work to Educate Members on Running the Cooperative Thriftily and Developing Production

    (Our report) The Party Branch of the Minzu Road Production Service Cooperative on Minzu Road, Jiefangbei, Chongqing, persists in educating its members on running the cooperative thriftily and managing their households diligently, enabling all cadres and members of the cooperative to generally develop a thrifty work style, achieving frugality in everything and savings in every household.

    The Minzu Road Production Service Cooperative has more than 2,800 households, mostly families of industrialists and businesspeople and families of workers. In the past, they rarely participated in social production except for taking care of household chores. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they established 22 various street factories and production organizations, and those who were able to work gradually participated in production.

    With the development of production, some people developed ideas of extravagance and neglected the principle of running the cooperative thriftily. After discovering these ideological problems, the Party branch adopted the method of airing views and holding debates to educate everyone on running the cooperative thriftily, making everyone realize that only by running the cooperative thriftily and rapidly expanding accumulation can production be continuously developed, and only when production is developed can the welfare of life be improved. At the same time, the Party branch paid special attention to educating Party members to take the lead in implementing the principle of running the cooperative thriftily. In this way, cadres and members gradually developed a thrifty work style in running the cooperative. For example, in terms of adding production equipment, they followed the principle of "using local methods if possible, simplifying if possible, repairing if possible, and manufacturing if possible," adopting the methods of "borrowing, renting, and transferring," and relying on members to repair by hand, solving the problem of more than 30 factory buildings needed by the cooperative; at the same time, they sent members to learn production technology from large factories and manufactured more than 300 kinds of tools themselves. As a result of running the cooperative thriftily throughout the year, the entire cooperative had more than 25,000 yuan of public accumulation, and the cooperative purchased production materials such as lathes and electric drills, ensuring the continuous development of production. This cooperative mainly uses waste materials, scraps, and surplus materials for processing and manufacturing. They used waste materials and surplus materials to make more than 100 kinds of urgently needed products for life or production, which sold very well. The production of street factories is becoming more and more prosperous, and the total value of production has increased from about 1,000 yuan per month at the beginning to the current 80,000 to 90,000 yuan.

    In terms of establishing collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and life service stations, the Party branch educated relevant staff to establish the idea that members should not only live well, but also spend less, and sent Party members to various collective welfare units to cultivate typical examples and establish banners. Party member He Bingran promoted the "raw steaming rice and cold water soaking method" in two canteens, which increased the efficiency of rice production. The Party branch then convened a site meeting of all canteen staff in the cooperative to promote this advanced experience throughout the cooperative. After that, the canteens not only lowered the price of meals and reduced the burden on the members, but also saved more than 46,000 jin of grain last year. The grain, water, coal, electricity, etc. saved by the canteens reduced the living expenses of the members by 6,960 yuan last year. The members felt that "the canteen is like their own family," and the number of people eating together continued to increase, from more than 4,000 at the beginning to the current more than 6,000. Among the ten canteens in the cooperative, three have become advanced units in the city and district. The nursery staff also used old cloth to make cotton slippers, gloves, and capes for the children, and used waste wood and waste paper to make more than 500 sets of teaching aids and toys.

    With the continuous development of the service cooperative's production, the income of the members has generally increased. Now, a worker can generally earn 30 to 50 yuan per month, and some earn as much as 70 to 80 yuan. Now, more than 2,000 households in the cooperative have consciously signed a thrift agreement for managing their households, and the monthly deposits of the members have increased from about 1,000 yuan in the early days of the cooperative to the current about 20,000 yuan, becoming an advanced unit in savings in the entire district.

    重庆民族路服务社党支部深入进行思想工作
    教育社员勤俭办社发展生产
    本报讯　重庆市解放碑民族路生产服务社党支部，坚持对社员进行勤俭办社、勤俭持家的教育，使全社干部和社员普遍养成勤俭风气，做到了事事讲节俭，户户有储蓄。
    民族路生产服务社二千八百多户居民，多系工商业者家属和职工家属，他们过去除料理家务外，很少参加社会生产。1958年大跃进中，他们分别建立了各种街道工厂和生产组织二十二个，能劳动的人都陆续参加了生产。
    随着生产的发展，有些人产生了讲排场的思想，忽视了勤俭办社的方针。党支部发现这些思想问题后，采取鸣放辩论的方法，向大家进行了勤俭办社的教育，使大家认识到只有勤俭办社，迅速扩大积累，才能使生产不断发展，只有生产发展了，生活福利才能提高。同时，党支部还特别注意教育党员带头贯彻勤俭办社的方针。这样，干部和社员就逐渐养成了勤俭办社的风气。例如在添置生产设备方面，他们按照“能土就土、能简就简、能补就补、能造就造”的原则，采取“借、租、调”的办法，依靠社员动手修补，解决了社里需要的三十多间厂房；同时派社员向大厂学习生产技术，自己制造了三百多种工具。一年来勤俭办社的结果，全社有了两万五千多元的公共积累，社里购买了车床、电钻等生产资料，保证了生产不断发展的需要。这个社主要利用废材、边角、余料来加工制造。他们利用废材余料制出了一百多种生活或生产急需的产品，销路很好。街道工厂的生产越来越兴旺，生产总值由开始每月一千多元左右，增加到目前的八、九万元。
    在兴办公共食堂、托儿所、生活服务站等集体福利事业方面，党支部则教育有关工作人员树立既要社员生活得好，又要花费得少的思想，并派党员深入各集体福利单位，培养典型，树立旗帜。党员何炳然在两个食堂中推行“生蒸米冷水发饭法”，增加了出饭效率。党支部便召开全社食堂工作人员开现场会，在全社推广了这一先进经验。在这以后，各个食堂不但降低了饭价，减轻了社员的负担，而且去年还节约了四万六千多斤粮食。各个食堂节约的粮食、水、煤、电等，去年就为社员减少了六千九百六十元的生活开支。社员感到“食堂跟自己家庭一样”，搭伙人数不断增加，由开始的四千多人增加到现在的六千多人。全社十个食堂中，有三个成为市、区先进单位。幼儿园的保育人员也利用旧布给小孩做棉拖鞋、手套、披风，并利用废柴、废纸做了五百多套教具和玩具。
    随着服务社的生产不断发展，社员的收入，普遍有了增加。现在一个劳动力每月一般都可收入三、五十元，高的有七、八十元。现在全社两千多户居民，都自觉地订了勤俭持家公约，社员每月存款由建社初期的一千元左右，增加到目前的两万元左右，成为全区储蓄的先进单位。　　（袁光厚）
