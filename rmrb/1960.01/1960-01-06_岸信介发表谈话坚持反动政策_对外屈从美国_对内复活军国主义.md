Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 3rd: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's speech at the first press conference of the year held in Atami on the 2nd indicates that he intends to further submit to the United States on the basis of signing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, strengthen the revival of militarism internally, and intensify economic expansion externally.

Answering questions about easing international tensions and signing a new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," Kishi said that it would be good to resolve world tensions through consultation, but the differences between the two worldviews of "liberalism" and communism are irreconcilable. Japan must always stand on the position of "liberalism" and U.S.-Japan cooperation to "contribute to world peace and prosperity." He said, "The true meaning of revising the Security Treaty lies here. I intend to make U.S.-Japan relations equal, approach the principle of internationally jointly guaranteeing security treaties in the form of a collective security guarantee system, maintain Japan's peace and prosperity, and clarify the approach of U.S.-Japan cooperation." Kishi believes that based on this view, (Japan) can establish a foundation for "U.S.-Japan cooperation" by revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." He said that Japan needs to rely on this foundation to establish a new route. He also said that by revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," it will be clear what attitude and measures Japan should take in the future international situation. He emphasized that (Japan) "must adhere to U.S.-Japan cooperation, adhere to the position of liberalism, and must proceed from this position to solve various diplomatic problems and various outstanding issues."

Referring to his meeting with U.S. President Eisenhower in mid-January after signing the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," Kishi said that he intends to inquire about the United States' true intentions regarding countermeasures against communist countries, and frankly exchange views with President Eisenhower on "developing" underdeveloped countries and further promoting U.S.-Japan economic cooperation.

Kishi also nakedly exposed Japan's latent imperialist expansionist ambitions in Asia. He said that it is necessary for Japan to participate in the work of "developing" underdeveloped countries, "especially, Japan is very concerned about Asia."

In order to have the United States support the development and expansion of Japanese monopoly capital in terms of funds, Kishi, disregarding Japan's national interests, expressed welcome to the further penetration of American capital into various economic sectors of Japan.

In this speech, Kishi indicated that he would continue to adhere to the anti-China policy that is strongly opposed by the Japanese public. He said, "Regarding the policy towards Communist China, since Taiwan is involved, we intend to take a wait-and-see attitude as in the past." He said, "We should not say that we will send a delegation to Communist China after the work on the security treaty is completed." Kishi also stated that he would continue to play the trick of "separating politics and economics" in Japan-China relations. His statement was, "Japan should limit its relations with communist countries to the scope of economic and cultural activities."

Due to the implementation of reactionary policies that sell out national interests, Kishi is becoming increasingly unpopular, and even within the ruling party, some people are demanding that Kishi step down after revising the "Security Treaty." However, Kishi stated in yesterday's speech that he does not intend to "retire." He said ambitiously, "Revising the Security Treaty is not the end, but the starting point."

    岸信介发表谈话坚持反动政策
    对外屈从美国　对内复活军国主义
    据新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介2日在热海举行的今年第一次记者招待会上的谈话表明，他要在签订日美军事同盟条约的基础上，进一步屈从美国，对内加强复活军国主义，对外加紧实行经济扩张。
    岸信介在答复关于缓和国际紧张局势和签订新的日美“安全条约”问题时说，用协商的办法去解决世界上的紧张局势，这好是好，可是，“自由主义”和共产主义这两种世界观的分歧却无法调和。日本必须始终站在“自由主义”和日美合作的立场上“对世界的和平和繁荣作出贡献”。他说，“改订安全条约的真正意义也就在这里。我打算使日美关系平等，以集体安全保障体制的形态接近国际上共同保障安全条约的原则，保持日本的和平和繁荣，使日美合作的做法趋于明确”。岸信介认为基于这个观点，（日本）通过修改日美“安全条约”，就能够建立“日美合作”的基础。他说，日本需要依靠这个基础确立新的路线。他还说，通过修改日美“安全条约”，日本在今后的国际局势中应该采取什么样的态度和措施，就能够清楚了。他强调（日本）“要坚持日美合作，要坚持自由主义的立场，并且必须从这样的立场出发，来解决外交方面的各种问题和各种悬而未决的问题。”
    谈到他将在1月中旬签订新的日美“安全条约”后同美国总统艾森豪威尔的会谈时，岸信介说，他打算就对共产主义国家的对策，询问美国的真实意图，并且就“开发”不发达国家和进一步推进日美经济合作问题同艾森豪威尔总统坦率地交换意见。
    岸信介还赤裸裸地暴露了日本对亚洲的潜在帝国主义的扩张野心。他说，日本有必要参加“开发”不发达国家的工作，“尤其是，日本非常关心亚洲”。
    为了使美国在资金方面支持日本垄断资本发展和扩张，岸信介不顾日本民族利益，表示欢迎美国资本进一步渗入日本各个经济部门。
    岸信介在这次谈话中表示，他要继续坚持遭到日本公众强烈反对的敌视中国的政策。他说，“关于对共产党中国的政策，由于牵连到台湾，所以打算像以往那样采取静观态度。”他说，“我们不应该说什么在关于安全条约的工作完成以后就派一个使节团到共产党中国去”。岸信介还表示在日中关系上要继续玩弄“政治和经济分开”的伎俩。他的说法是，“日本应该把它同共产党国家之间的关系局限于经济和文化活动的范围内”。
    由于执行出卖民族利益的反动政策，岸信介越来越不得人心，甚至执政党内部也有人要求岸信介在修改“安全条约”后下台。但是，岸信介在昨天的谈话中表示他不打算“退休”。他野心勃勃地说，“改订安全条约不是终点，而是起点。”
