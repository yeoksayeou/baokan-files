    The joy of all people building roads
    A railway is long, so long,
    Newly turned soil emits fragrance,
    Red flags are planted on both sides,
    People-run railways are so glorious;
    Men and women are all mobilized,
    The joy of all people building roads. (Tang Bingqing)

    万民修路真欢畅一条铁路长又长，新翻泥土放芬芳，红色旗子两旁插，民办铁路多荣光；男男女女齐出动，万民修路真欢畅。（唐冰清）
