One Boat, Multiple Uses
    Able to Irrigate and Drain, Generate Electricity, Mill Rice, Carry Passengers and Freight

    A multi-purpose integrated machine boat with the functions of irrigation and drainage, transportation, grain processing, and power generation has recently been successfully trial-produced in Wuhu City.

    This integrated machine boat was jointly researched and trial-produced by the Anhui Provincial Department of Water Conservancy and Electric Power, the Department of Transportation, and the Jiangfeng Shipyard to meet the needs of rural people's communes.

    At present, a large number of irrigation and drainage machines in rural areas are mostly idle except when used for drought resistance and flood drainage. However, there is an urgent need for power machinery in transportation and grain processing. The development of this new type of ship will greatly improve the utilization rate of rural power machinery.

    This integrated machine boat has a fully loaded speed of 11.8 kilometers per hour, a carrying capacity of 20 tons, and can carry more than 70 passengers. This improves transportation efficiency by one to one and a half times compared to wooden sailboats of the same size. When used for irrigation and drainage, this boat can drive a 20-horsepower water pump; when used for grain processing, it can drive an 18-inch rice mill and a rice huller each, milling 2,000 to 2,400 jin of rice and hulling 4,000 to 7,000 jin of rice per hour. When used for power generation, it can drive a 15 kW generator. Therefore, it is not only a mobile irrigation and drainage station, rice milling station, and power station, but also can transport passengers and freight.

### 一船多用  能排灌、能发电、能碾米、能载客运货

    一船多用
    能排灌、能发电、能碾米、能载客运货
    一艘具有排灌、航运、粮食加工、发电多种用途的综合利用机船最近在芜湖市试制成功。
    这艘综合利用机船是安徽省水利电力厅、交通厅为了适应农村人民公社需要，会同江风船舶厂共同研究试制的。
    目前农村大批排灌机械除在抗旱排涝时使用外，大部分时间闲置不用。而航运、粮食等加工方面又迫切需要动力机械。这种新型船舶的制成，对提高农村动力机器的利用率有很大作用。
    这种综合利用机船每小时满载航速为十一点八公里，载重量为二十吨，可载客七十余人。比同样大的木帆船提高运输效率一倍到一倍半。这种船用于排灌可带动一台二十马力的水泵；用于粮食加工可带动十八吋碾米机及砻谷机各一台，每小时可碾米二千至二千四百斤，砻谷四千至七千斤。用于发电可带动十五瓩发电机一台。所以它不但是一个流动的排灌站、碾米站、发电站，而且可以运客载货。
