    Homecoming Dream
    Poem by Du Ruoxiang, Drawing by Miao Di
    Eight hundred and two overseas Chinese, warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in the motherland, have returned to Shenzhen. … Zhou Tie, a 67-year-old man who had lived in Indonesia for forty years, carried only a broken rattan basket. The cordial reception and condolences from the motherland moved him to tears. He said, "I really didn't expect this, am I dreaming?"
    (January 8th People's Daily)
    A pair of old leather shoes, treading across the foreign land;
    A broken rattan basket, filled with the tears of bitterness.
    Forty years of homecoming dreams, realized in laughter;
    Forty years of nightmares, shattered in the shadows of tears.
    Before our eyes, the magnificent rivers and mountains of the motherland, boundless and without end;
    Everyone opens their arms, warmly embracing you!
    Care like the sea, intentions as sweet as honey,
    How can this small rattan basket hold it all!

    归梦
    杜若湘　诗  苗地　画
    有八百零二名华侨，在祖国各界人民的热情接待下，回到了深圳。……一位在印度尼西亚侨居四十年的六十七岁老人周帖，手里只提着一个破藤篮，祖国的亲切接待和慰问，使他感动得落泪，他说：“真真想不到，我是在做梦吗？”（1月8日人民日报）一双旧皮鞋，踏遍异乡的土地；一只破藤篮，装满辛酸的眼泪。四十年归梦，在笑声里实现；四十年噩梦，在泪影里摇碎。眼前锦绣河山，无边又无际；个个张开手臂，热烈拥抱你！海一样的关怀，蜜一般的心意，这小小的藤篮，如何盛得起！
