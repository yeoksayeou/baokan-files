Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, January 25th: The All-Indonesia Peace Consultation Conference opened in Bandung today.

    President Sukarno, speaking at the opening ceremony, said, "If we let arms dealers and imperialism control our destiny, we will suffer disaster. Therefore, we must mobilize the people against war and nuclear weapons in order to bring happiness to the people."

    Sukarno said that if all the progressive forces in the world rise up to safeguard peace and forbid the use of nuclear energy for destruction, peace will surely be achieved. He said that the Indonesian people demand that the upcoming summit meeting in Paris be able to successfully reach an agreement on disarmament.

    Sukarno said that the vast majority of the Indonesian people fully support the peace movement, but a small group of people oppose the peace movement; they are the reactionaries who support imperialism. He pointed out that some people insist that the peace movement is a communist movement, which is shameless propaganda.

    Abbas, Vice-Chairman of the All-Indonesia Peace Committee, briefly reviewed the world peace movement and Indonesia's role in the peace movement, and condemned various military treaties. He specifically mentioned the huge budget of NATO last year.

    Abbas said that the current international tension has eased somewhat. However, certain forces in the world are still trying to maintain tensions and military blocs, thereby creating international tension. He pointed out that imperialism is the sole cause of tensions. He stated that the Indonesian people support the convening of a summit meeting and disarmament.

    Abbas added that the disputes between some Asian countries are not disputes of principle, and the spirit of the Bandung Conference will not be harmed as a result. He said he hoped the twentieth century would be a century in which peace would be victorious and mankind would receive welfare and happiness.

    Aziz Sharif, representative of the National Committee of Iraqi Peace Partisans, speaking on behalf of the World Peace Council, paid tribute to Indonesia's struggle for peace. He also conveyed the congratulations and respect of Iraqi Prime Minister Qassem to the Indonesian people. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism is still sparing no effort in trying to undermine the Iraqi revolution, and the main members of the Central Treaty Organization are gathering troops on the Iraqi border, trying to threaten Iraq.

    He said that due to the growing strength of world peace forces, imperialist countries have been forced to agree to discuss world disarmament and participate in the upcoming summit meeting. However, he warned that warmongers will do everything possible to obstruct the development of mutual assistance and cooperation between countries, thereby attempting to undermine the roots of easing international tensions.

    He pointed out the great danger of the upcoming meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council, because the Indonesian people's own experience has exposed the crimes of this aggressive military treaty. He said that this military treaty is supporting Dutch colonialists in occupying West Irian.

    The All-Indonesia Peace Consultation Conference will discuss disarmament, the struggle to ban nuclear weapons, peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems, economic and cultural cooperation between countries, and other issues related to world peace.

    全印度尼西亚和平协商会议开幕
    苏加诺强调不能听任帝国主义摆布命运
    阿巴斯指出帝国主义是造成紧张局势的唯一原因
    据新华社万隆25日电　全印度尼西亚和平协商会议今天在万隆开幕。
    苏加诺总统在开幕仪式上讲话时说，“如果我们听任军火商人和帝国主义摆布我们的命运，我们就将遭到灾难，因此必须动员人民反对战争和核武器，以便给人民带来幸福”。
    苏加诺说，如果全世界的进步力量都起来维护和平，不准使用核能来进行破坏，和平就一定能实现。他说，印度尼西亚人民要求即将在巴黎举行的最高级会议能够成功地就裁军问题达成协议。
    苏加诺说，绝大多数印度尼西亚人民全力支持和平运动，但是有一小撮人反对和平运动，他们是支持帝国主义的反动派。他指出，有人硬说和平运动为共产党人的运动，这是无耻的宣传。
    印度尼西亚全国和平委员会副主席阿巴斯扼要地回顾了世界和平运动和印度尼西亚在和平运动中的作用，并且谴责各种军事条约。他特别提到去年北大西洋公约组织的庞大预算。
    阿巴斯说，现在国际紧张局势有所缓和。但是，世界上某些势力仍然企图保持紧张局势和军事集团，从而形成国际紧张局势。他指出，帝国主义是造成紧张局势的唯一原因。他表示，印度尼西亚人民拥护召开最高级会议和裁军。
    阿巴斯又说，亚洲一些国家之间的争端不是原则性的争端，万隆会议精神不会因而受损。他说，愿二十世纪成为和平得到胜利、人类得到福利和幸福的世纪。
    伊拉克和平战士全国委员会的阿齐兹·谢里夫代表世界和平理事会讲话时向印度尼西亚争取和平的斗争致敬。他并转达了伊拉克总理卡塞姆对印度尼西亚人民的祝贺和敬意。他指出，美帝国主义仍然在不遗余力地试图破坏伊拉克革命，中央条约组织的主要成员国则在伊拉克边境集结军队，试图威胁伊拉克。
    他说，由于世界和平力量的日益壮大，帝国主义国家被迫同意讨论世界裁军和参加即将举行的最高级会议。但是，他警告说，战争贩子将会竭力阻挠各国间互助合作关系的发展，从而企图破坏缓和国际紧张局势的根源。
    他指出了即将要召开的东南亚条约组织理事会会议的巨大危险性，因为印度尼西亚人民自身的经验已经揭露了这个侵略性军事条约的罪行。他说，就是这个军事条约在支持着荷兰殖民主义者占领西伊里安。
    全印度尼西亚和平协商会议将讨论裁军问题、争取禁止核武器的斗争、不同制度的国家之间的和平共处、国家之间的经济和文化合作和其它有关世界和平的问题。
