The Panhe River in Fangcheng County, Henan Province, has a water-powered mill that, from the outside, looks no different from any old water mill, with three dilapidated thatched houses and a narrow canal. However, it supplies noodles for over ten thousand people in the Chengguan People's Commune, with some left over. Inside the building, four small steel mills are spinning together, and the flour flows down four round iron cylinders into an automatic sifter. The automatic sifter shakes back and forth, producing flour on one side and bran on the other. The workers work easily beside it.

This water mill was built by the Chengguan People's Commune in Fangcheng County. The small steel mills and automatic sifter were manufactured by the commune's machinery factory. They only use 0.3 flow units of the Panhe River's water, and they produce 14,000 jin of flour per day and night. Fourteen workers work here, divided into two shifts, milling flour non-stop day and night.

After this water mill officially went into production three months ago, it replaced the original 56 old-style mills. The flour produced not only meets the needs of the commune members but also supports the needs of other commune members and urban residents outside the commune.

    一盘水打磨能供一万多人吃面
    河南方城县潘河上有一个水打磨，从外表上看，和古老的水打磨没有什么区别，三间破草房外加一条窄狭的水渠，但是它却供应了城关人民公社一万多人吃面，还有剩余。进入房内，只见四盘小钢磨一齐转动，面粉顺着四个圆铁筒流入一个自动箩，自动箩来回筛动，一边出面一边出麸。工人们在一旁轻松地工作着。
    这盘水磨是方城县城关人民公社建成的，其中的小钢磨和自动箩是公社机械厂制造的。他们只利用了潘河水零点三个流量，一昼夜便出面粉一万四千斤。在这里工作的有十四个工人，分为两班生产，昼夜不停地磨面。
    这盘水磨在三个月前正式投入生产后，代替了原来五十六盘旧式磨，生产的面粉除自给外，还能支援其他公社社员和社外市民的需要。
