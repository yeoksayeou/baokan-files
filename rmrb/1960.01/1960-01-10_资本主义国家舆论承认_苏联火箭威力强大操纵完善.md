Capitalist Countries' Public Opinion Acknowledges
    Soviet Rockets' Powerful and Well-Controlled Nature

Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: According to TASS reports, the Soviet Union's upcoming launch of a powerful rocket has drawn attention from capitalist countries.

On the 8th, all of London's evening central newspapers published TASS's communiqué in prominent positions with large headlines.

The "News Chronicle's" science commentator said that the Soviet Union's plan to test a new rocket once again demonstrates the power and perfected control of Soviet rockets. The commentator believes that the area where the rocket is scheduled to fall, as stated in the TASS communiqué, is very small. The commentator also pointed out that the distance from the rocket launch site to the scheduled landing area is no less than six thousand five hundred kilometers in any case, and it is particularly impressive if one considers that the rocket being launched is not carrying a final stage.

Many newspapers, including the "Daily Express," believe that the news of the Soviet Union's upcoming rocket test has caused a "bomb explosion" like impression in the West, especially in the United States.

On the 8th, all evening newspapers in Paris also published the news of the Soviet Union's upcoming new rocket test on the front page with large headlines.

"Le Monde" said that TASS's authorized announcement of the area where the rocket will fall proves how accurate Soviet scientists have become in controlling rockets.

Many Italian newspapers published the Soviet TASS communiqué in prominent positions. "L'Unità" considered the communiqué "exciting" and emphasized that the creation of such a rocket by Soviet scientists is the first step in achieving interplanetary flight.

Rome's "Il Tempo" emphasized that the TASS communiqué precisely indicated the area where the test will be conducted. Rome's "Il Messaggero" pointed out that if "the Soviet Union can so accurately specify the area where the rocket will fall in the Pacific, it shows that the Soviet Union has made great achievements in rocket manufacturing."

All evening newspapers in Japan on the 8th reported the news of the Soviet Union's upcoming launch of a powerful rocket with banner headlines.

"Akahata" emphasized that the Soviet Union's publication of the communiqué about the rocket launch is entirely in line with the requirements for the peaceful use of outer space, and the time it has chosen is precisely when the fishing season in this area is over.

Japanese newspapers pointed out in a large number of commentaries and articles that the gap between the Soviet Union and the United States in the development of rocket manufacturing is constantly widening. "Asahi Shimbun" said that it is as if at the very beginning of 1960, the Soviet Union announced that it would further surpass the United States in conquering outer space.

    资本主义国家舆论承认
    苏联火箭威力强大操纵完善
    据新华社9日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联即将发射强力火箭的消息引起了资本主义国家的重视。
    8日，伦敦所有晚出版的中央报纸都在显著地位用大标题登载了塔斯社的公报。
    “新闻纪事报”的科学评论员说，苏联计划试验新火箭再一次地表明苏联火箭的威力和操纵的完善。评论员认为，塔斯社公报中预定火箭下落的区域是非常小的。评论员还指出，从发射火箭地点到预定下落区域的距离无论如何不少于六千五百公里，特别是，如果考虑到，发射的是不带最后一级的火箭这点，那将会产生极深刻的印象。
    许多报纸，其中包括“每日快报”在内，都认为苏联即将试验火箭的消息在西方，特别在美国都产生了炸弹爆发一样的印象。
    8日，巴黎所有晚报也都在头版用大标题登载了苏联即将试验新火箭的消息。
      “世界报”说，塔斯社受权宣布火箭将下落的区域，这证明着苏联科学家在操纵火箭方面已达到了多么准确的地步。
    意大利许多报纸以显著地位刊载了苏联塔斯社的公报。“团结报”认为这个公报是“激动人心的”，并且强调指出，苏联科学家创造这种火箭是实现行星际飞行的第一步。
    罗马“时代报”强调指出，塔斯社公报精确地指出将要进行试验的地区。罗马“国家报”指出，如果“苏联能够这样精确地规定火箭在太平洋落下的地区，这就表明苏联在火箭制造方面已经取得了巨大的成就。”
    8日的日本的所有晚报都以通栏大字标题报道了苏联要发射强力火箭的消息。
    “赤旗报”着重指出，苏联发表关于要发射火箭的公报完全符合和平利用宇宙空间的要求，它所选定的时间正是这个地区的捕鱼季节结束的时候。
    日本报纸在大量的评论和文章中指出，苏联和美国在发展火箭制造方面的悬殊距离正在不断扩大。“朝日新闻”说，这很像是在1960年一开头，苏联就宣布在征服宇宙空间方面将会更加超过美国。
