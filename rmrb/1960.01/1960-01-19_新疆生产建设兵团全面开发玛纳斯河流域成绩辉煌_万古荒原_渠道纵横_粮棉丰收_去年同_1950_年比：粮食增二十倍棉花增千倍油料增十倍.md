(Reported by Yang Ke Xian, our reporter) The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, based on a unified plan and a comprehensive water management policy, has achieved remarkable successes in the full development of the Manas River water resources after ten years of continuous struggle. Currently, a complete water conservancy system has been established on more than 12,000 square kilometers of wilderness in the entire Manas River basin, from the Tasi River in the east to the Gurtu River in the west. Over 100,000 kilometers of main canals, branch canals, farm canals, and field ditches, along with a series of large, medium, and small reservoirs with a total storage capacity of over 600 million cubic meters, connect the 3.3 million mu of land reclaimed by the production corps in the Junggar Basin into seven large self-flowing irrigation areas. These irrigation areas have dense shelterbelts and interconnected roads, large areas of farmland suitable for tractor cultivation, and irrigation and drainage systems as dense as spider webs. Adding the benefited land of farmers of all ethnic groups in Manas, Shawan, Usu, and other eight counties, the cultivated land area in the Manas River basin has increased from over 600,000 mu in 1950 to over 4.5 million mu.

The Manas River basin is located in northern Xinjiang and is one of the key areas for reclamation by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. It includes eight rivers, including the Tasi River, Manas River, Ningjia River, Jinsha River, Bayingou River, Kuytun River, Sikeshu River, and Gurtu River, as well as eleven springs. The annual flow of rivers and springs reaches over 4.36 billion cubic meters. The climate in this area is extremely dry, and the rivers are inland rivers formed by melting snow from the Tianshan Mountains. During spring irrigation, the flow of each river is very small because the snow has not yet melted. Due to continuous seepage and evaporation through gravel strata along the way, some river water cannot reach the cultivated land. Before liberation, the irrigated area in the Manas River basin was only over 500,000 mu; a large amount of farmland was inevitably affected by drought every spring, and flood disasters were inevitable when summer floods arrived. After ten years of efforts by the Production and Construction Corps, a high-standard water conservancy project system for drought and flood resistance, irrigation, and drainage has been established here. Currently, the development of water conservancy in the Manas River basin has entered a new stage of combining backbone projects with hydropower generation and navigation development. More than 20,000 production soldiers, while continuing to complete the last batch of large-scale water conservancy projects and building farmland irrigation projects, have started the construction of two hydropower stations with an installed capacity of 18,000 kilowatts. Some farms have established small hydropower stations for lighting and agricultural and sideline product processing.

The soldiers of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps have overcome the drought in the Junggar Basin, where the annual rainfall is only over 170 millimeters but the evaporation is over 1,700 millimeters. They have established 36 large-scale mechanized and water conservancy state-owned military reclamation farms, built the two industrial cities of Shihezi and Taotun, and achieved comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and are moving towards a large-scale commercial base with comprehensive agricultural and animal husbandry characteristics such as grain, cotton, oil, soybeans, animal products, meat, and eggs. In 1959 alone, the production corps harvested over 310 million jin of grain crops such as wheat, rice, and corn, 240,000 dan of ginned cotton, and over 5.39 million jin of oil crops on 2.08 million mu of planted area in the Manas River basin. Compared with 1950, oil increased tenfold, grain increased twentyfold, and cotton production increased a thousandfold. More than 150,000 mu of various trees and fruit trees have been planted. The earliest built Shihezi New City and the 23rd Regiment Farm have become well-known garden scenic spots in northern Xinjiang. Animal husbandry and poultry production have also developed rapidly, with more than 360,000 heads of livestock such as pigs, cattle, horses, and sheep, and more than 390,000 poultry. In 1959, a total of more than 5.63 million jin of poultry and livestock meat were provided to the state.

Water conservancy has promoted the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, and agriculture and animal husbandry have driven the development of industry and processing sideline occupations. Centered on Shihezi and Taotun, the production corps has built a large number of modern industries and handicraft factories such as agricultural machinery repair and assembly, fertilizers, flour, starch, sugar making, winemaking, cotton ginning, oil pressing, and papermaking. In Shihezi New City alone, the "August 1st" Joint Processing Plant with an annual output of 22,000 tons of flour and 2,500 tons of vegetable oil, a sugar factory with an annual output of 27,000 tons of sugar, and a cotton textile factory with an annual output of 140,000 meters of canvas and 130,000 cotton blankets have been established. Modern industries such as wool spinning and cotton spinning are also under construction. In 1959, the total industrial output value of the Manas River basin reached more than 65 million yuan, an increase of nearly onefold compared with 1958.

When the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps entered the wilderness of the Junggar Basin before the spring plowing in 1950, they issued the ambitious statement of "Transforming the desert into fertile fields, transforming the Gobi into gardens" and "Long-term construction of the border region," and actively fought against the drought and floods of the wilderness. At that time, there was no food and no housing. The people's soldiers, with high revolutionary enthusiasm, endured hardships and overcame all difficulties to build water conservancy and reclaim farmland. From 1950 to 1953, the production corps carried out water and soil resource surveys while reclaiming and producing, and finally learned about the water conservancy resources of the eight rivers in the Manas River basin and the wasteland that could be reclaimed downstream of each river.

The people's soldiers built a large number of small farmland irrigation projects, and also built a series of backbone projects. Among the backbone projects that have been completed, there are control structures at all levels such as water diversion and drainage, water transmission, and water distribution, as well as fifteen artificial riverbeds, which have canalized the river channels. These artificial riverbeds are mostly built with dry-laid pebbles or mortar-laid rubble, with a total length of more than 880 li, preventing the massive seepage of the original gravel riverbeds. The backbone projects also include a series of flood control projects and nine large and medium-sized reservoirs for diverting and storing floodwater and winter idle water. These backbone projects and the farmland irrigation network have formed a complete water conservancy system.

Such a large-scale water conservancy system project requires a lot of funds, equipment, and technical personnel. The Production and Construction Corps mainly relied on self-reliance to build all the water conservancy projects in the Manas River basin. The artificial riverbeds and artificial canals were mostly built by collecting large pebbles from the Gobi Desert and dry-laying or mortar-laying them. More than 10,000 structures on various canals and reservoirs were also built using local materials. The troops lacked technical personnel during construction, so they adopted various methods such as running training classes and taking on apprentices to train themselves. Over the years, they have trained thousands of water conservancy engineering technicians. (Attached picture)

    新疆生产建设兵团全面开发玛纳斯河流域成绩辉煌
    万古荒原　渠道纵横　粮棉丰收
    去年同1950年比：粮食增二十倍棉花增千倍油料增十倍
    本报讯　记者杨克现报道：新疆生产建设兵团，根据统一规划，综合治理的水利方针，经过十年持续不断的斗争，全面开发玛纳斯河流水利，取得辉煌成就。目前，东起塔西河，西止古尔图河，整个玛纳斯河流域地区一万二千多平方公里的荒原上，已经建立起完整的水利体系。十万多公里长的干渠、支渠、农渠、毛渠和蓄水量达六亿多公方的一系列大、中、小型水库，把生产部队在准噶尔盆地开垦出来的三百三十多万亩土地连成了七个巨大的自流灌溉区。这些灌区内，有丛密的林带和四通八达的公路，有土地连片便于拖拉机耕作的大面积条田，有密如蛛网的灌溉排水系统。如果加上玛纳斯、沙湾、乌苏等八县各族农民受益土地，玛纳斯河流域耕地面积已从1950年的六十多万亩，增加到四百五十多万亩。
    玛纳斯河流域在新疆的北部，是新疆生产建设兵团开荒重点地区之一。这里包括塔西河、玛纳斯河、宁嘉河、金沙河、八音沟河、奎屯河、四棵树河和古尔图河等八条河流，另有泉水十一条。河水和泉水年流量达四十三亿六千多万公方。这一带气候异常干燥，加上河流都是依靠天山融雪形成的内陆河，春灌时，由于雪尚未融，各河流量很小，经过沿途砾石地层又不断渗漏和蒸发，有些河水因此流不到耕地上。解放以前，玛纳斯河流域引水灌溉的面积只有五十多万亩；大量农田每年春季不免受旱，夏洪来临又免不了洪水灾害。经过生产建设兵团十年的努力，这里已经建立起了抗旱抗洪、灌溉排水高标准的水利工程系统。目前开发玛纳斯河流域水利事业，已经进入了结合骨干工程利用水力发电和发展航运的新阶段。两万多名生产战士，在继续完成最后一批大型水利工程和兴建农田灌溉工程的同时，动工兴建两个装机容量达一万八千瓩的水电站。一部分农场已建立了为照明和农副产品加工的小型水电站。
    新疆生产建设兵团的战士战胜了年降雨量只有一百七十多毫米而蒸发量却达一千七百多毫米的准噶尔盆地荒原的干旱，在这里建立起三十六个大型机械化和水利化的国营军垦农场，兴建起石河子、套屯两个工业城市，使农林牧副渔和工业得到了全面发展，并且正向粮、棉、油、大豆、畜产品、肉类、蛋品等农牧业综合性质的大型商品基地迈进。1959年一年，生产部队在玛纳斯河流域二百零八万亩播种面积上，收获了小麦、水稻、玉米等粮食作物三亿一千多万斤，皮棉二十四万担，油料作物五百三十九万多斤。同1950年比较，油料增加了十倍，粮食增加了二十倍，棉花产量增加了一千倍。种植各种树木和果木十五万多亩，最早建成的石河子新城和二十三团农场，已成为北疆著名的园林风景区。畜牧业和家禽生产也发展很快，猪、牛、马、羊等家畜已达三十六万多头，家禽三十九万多只。1959年为国家提供的家禽家畜肉共五百六十三万多斤。
    水利促进了农牧业的发展，农牧业又带动了工业和加工副业的发展。生产部队以石河子、套屯为中心，建起大批农业机械修配、化肥、面粉、淀粉、制糖、酿酒、榨花、榨油、造纸等现代工业和手工业工厂。光是石河子新城一处，就建立了年产二万二千吨面粉和二千五百吨植物油的“八一”联合加工厂，年产砂糖二万七千吨的制糖厂，年产帆布十四万米、棉毯十三万条的棉织厂。正在兴建的还有毛纺、棉纺等现代工业。1959年玛纳斯河流域工业生产总值达六千五百多万元，比1958年提高近一倍。
    新疆生产建设兵团在1950年春耕前进入准噶尔盆地荒野时，就发出了“要把沙漠变良田，要把戈壁变花园”、“长期建设边疆”的壮言豪语，并且积极地同荒原的干旱、洪水作斗争。当时没有吃的、没有住的，人民战士以高度的革命热情，饮冰卧雪，排除万难，兴修水利，开荒造田。从1950年到1953年，生产部队一面开荒生产，一面进行水土资源勘查工作，终于摸清了玛纳斯河流域八条河流水利资源和各河下游可垦的荒地情况。
    人民战士兴修了大量的农田灌溉小型工程，同时也兴修了一系列骨干工程。目前已经完工的骨干工程中，有引水退水、输水、分水等各级控制建筑物及十五个人工河床，使河道达到了渠系化。这些人工河床大都是用干砌卵石或浆砌片石建成的，共长八百八十多华里，防止了原来砾石河床大量渗漏的现象。骨干工程还包括了一系列防洪工程、引蓄洪水和冬闲水的九个大、中型水库。这些骨干工程和农田灌溉网已经构成了完整的水利体系。
    这样一个大规模的水利体系工程，需要很多的资金、器材和技术人材。生产建设部队以自力更生为主建成了玛纳斯河流域的全部水利工程。人工河床和人工渠道，大都是就地采集戈壁滩上的大卵石干砌或浆砌而成的。各个渠道和水库上一万多座建筑物，也是就地取材建立起来的。施工中缺乏技术人员，部队就采取办训练班、带徒弟等多种办法自己培养，几年来已培养出数以千计的水利工程技术人员。（附图片）
