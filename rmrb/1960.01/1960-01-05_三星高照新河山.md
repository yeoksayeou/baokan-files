    Three Stars Shine on the New River and Mountains
    Kang Bocheng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Jinbei District Committee, Shanxi Province

    If you take a plane to the north of our motherland, in the area where the Sanggan River flows, you will see large and small reservoirs scattered like stars in the sky, and long and short canals like a spider web. Facing these water conservancy projects, the Sanggan River has become docile and is delivering its inexhaustible flow, according to people's will, to the fields, power stations, orchards, and everywhere that needs water. Looking at the two rows of forest belts stretching into the distance, like sentries guarding the banks of the Sanggan River; the large tracts of land that have been ravaged by it for generations are now vast stretches of fertile fields. Thanks to the growing comprehensive management of the Sanggan River water conservancy project, the more than one million people in the Sanggan River Basin have continuously reaped three years of bumper harvests since 1957, and every household is living a life of abundance.

    Before liberation, the Sanggan River brought endless disasters to the people on both sides of the river: the river water was like a ferocious dragon, either rushing and rampaging for miles, or the riverbed drying up without a drop of water. Sometimes, before people could even figure out what was happening in their sleep, they were swept into the turbid river by a huge wave. In the summer of 1939, the Hun River, a major tributary of the Sanggan River, experienced a major flood that submerged Hunyuan City and drowned more than 5,000 people. People still shudder at the mention of it. At that time, what flowed in the Sanggan River was not water, but the blood and tears of the people on both sides; what echoed in the Sanggan River was not the sound of water, but the sobbing of the people on both sides; people looked at the roaring and tumbling river water, and more than once silently muttered: Sanggan River, Sanggan River, when will you listen to us? …

    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, starting in 1953, with the development of the agricultural cooperative movement, the broad masses of farmers in the Sanggan River Basin launched water and soil conservation, afforestation, and the construction of large and small reservoirs, and began to comprehensively control this harmful river. Especially under the brilliant light of the three stars of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes in 1958, not only did small-scale water conservancy projects blossom everywhere, but also some large-scale water conservancy projects appeared in the Sanggan River Basin. For example, take the Sanggan River Reservoir, which is currently under construction. This reservoir is the largest key project on the entire Sanggan River main stream. Its main and auxiliary dams are 1,080 meters long in total, the dam is 41.5 meters high, the reservoir area is 40 square kilometers, the reservoir capacity is 720 million cubic meters of water, it irrigates 1.03 million mu of land, and generates 3,600 kilowatts of electricity. Such a huge reservoir was contracted by ten people's communes in Yanggao County and Wei County. Just imagine, without the deeply rooted General Line and the powerful strength of the People's Communes, would this be possible? In fact, there is more than just one such reservoir in the Sanggan River Basin. In the past two years, fifteen large reservoirs with a capacity of 10 million to 36 million cubic meters have been built in the entire Sanggan River Basin. If we add the small reservoirs built by the masses themselves in the tributaries, there are more than 270; if we calculate the canals that have been developed in the past few years, their length is four to five times longer than the entire 400-li-long Sanggan River. Now, the irrigated area in the Sanggan River Basin has reached more than 3.8 million mu.

    The Sanggan River has been tamed and has become beautiful. In recent years, the people on both sides of the river have carried out large-scale afforestation work, planting trees one by one beside it, braving the bone-chilling cold winter and the scorching hot summer. Now, the saplings planted in those years have grown into forests, and the Sanggan River has put on a green coat. This green Great Wall, more than 400 li long on both sides of the river, blocks the dust and sand blowing from the north, protects the tens of thousands of mu of fertile fields on both sides of the river, and is like countless arms stretching into the strata, holding the fertile land so that it is no longer eroded by water, and at the same time, it has grown 540,000 cubic meters of precious timber for us.

    As the Sanggan River is gradually tamed and gradually greened, the lives of the people on both sides of the river are constantly improving. In 1959, not only was there a bumper harvest of grain, but also, for the first time, tens of millions of fish fry were released into the reservoirs. The Zhenziliang Reservoir alone released 1.69 million fish fry, and rice was planted in large areas along the coast, as well as grapes surrounded by greenery; people's lives are no longer just oat noodles, yams, and millet as regular meals, but now they are eating rice and fresh fish from "Jiangnan outside Yanmen Pass."

    Harnessing water conservancy and benefiting future generations is the long-standing wish of the people in the Sanggan River Basin. If we say that in 1959, under the brilliant light of the three stars, we achieved great success in controlling the Sanggan River, then in 1960, this harmful river that has frightened people for generations will be tamed forever in our generation. For the plateau outside Yanmen Pass, which had no water in the past, this is such an exciting and joyous event. After a slightly longer period of time, the entire Sanggan River Basin will become a colorful and moving large garden. At that time, the more than 8 million mu of land on both sides of the river will be a landscape of lakes and mountains. In the sparkling rice fields, the verdant rice ears sway in the wind, the ripe wheat on thousands of acres emits a intoxicating fragrance, and the pink, white, and yellow lotus, peony, and evening primrose blossoms seem to surround the villages on both sides in a myriad of colorful flower beds. Under the crystal-clear grape trellises on the banks of the river, it will be the most pleasant place for people to take a rest and cool off; the tall forest belts on both sides will provide people with abundant timber, the fertile grasslands on both sides will breed more cattle and sheep for people, and the mirror-like reservoir lakes in the center will raise countless inexhaustible fresh fish for people; at night, when the generators are started, the twinkling lights of thousands of households on both sides of the river seem to have inlaid the earth with tens of millions of luminous pearls. On holidays, people can also sit on small motorboats and drift with the waves, looking at the boundless and beautiful rivers and mountains on both sides, and listening to the endless moving folk songs on both sides. At this time, if you want to tell the children something like: "Wild people outside Yanmen Pass, do not raise silkworms and do not plant hemp..." they will definitely feel at a loss.

    The one million people on both sides of the Sanggan River are heroic people. They are building their beautiful and prosperous hometown according to the general blueprint for socialist construction personally formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

    三星高照新河山
    中共山西晋北地委书记处书记　康伯成
    如果你坐上飞机，来到祖国的北方。那么，在桑干河流过的地方，你就会看到那大大小小星罗棋布的水库，那长长短短蛛网般的渠道。在这些水利工程面前，桑干河变得服贴了，正按照人们的意志，把它那永不枯竭的水流，送到田野，送到电站，送到果园，送到一切需要水的地方。再看那两行向远方延伸的林带，仿佛哨兵似的护卫在桑干河的两岸；世世代代曾被它冲刷遭害过的那大片大片的土地，现在是一脉阡陌良田。由于综合治理桑干河水利工程的日见发展，桑干河流域的一百多万人民，自1957年起，已经连续迎接了三个丰收的年头，家家过着丰衣足食的日子。
    解放前，桑干河给两岸人民带来过无穷尽的灾难：河水像头凶龙似的，不是横冲直闯席卷千里，就是河底干涸滴水皆无。有时人们在睡梦中还没来得及弄清楚是怎么回事，就被一阵巨浪卷进了混浊的河水中。1939年夏天，桑干河主要支流浑河发生了一次大水灾，一下就淹没了浑源城，淹死了群众五千多人。至今谈起此事，人们都不寒而栗。那时，桑干河流的不是水，而是两岸人民的血泪；桑干河里响的不是水声，而是两岸人民的呜咽；人们看着那咆哮翻滚的河水，不止一次默念着：桑干河呀桑干河，你什么时候能听听我们的话啊。……
  解放后，在党的领导下，从1953年起，随着农业合作化运动的发展，桑干河流域广大农民展开水土保持、植树造林、修建大小型水库，开始全面根治这条害河。特别是在1958年总路线、大跃进、人民公社化三星高照下，不仅小型水利工程并蒂莲开，一些大型的水利工程也在桑干河流域上出现了。比如，拿正在动工的桑干河水库来说吧，这个水库是整个桑干河干流上最大的一个枢纽工程，它的主、副坝全长一千零八十米，坝高四十一点五米，库内面积四十平方公里，库容七亿二千万公方水，灌溉土地一百零三万亩，发电三千六百瓩。这样一个巨大的水库，由阳高县和蔚县的十个人民公社就把它包下来了。试想，如果没有总路线的深入人心，没有人民公社的强大力量，这能够办得到吗？其实，像这样的水库，在桑干河流域上又何止一个。两年来，在整个桑干河流域上已经建成了容量在一千万到三千六百万公方的大型水库，就有十五个，如果再加上那些支流上群众自己就地修建的小型水库，就有二百七十余个；如果再把这几年开拓的渠道算一下，它们的长度，要比整个四百里长的桑干河还要长四倍到五倍。现在，桑干河流域的灌溉面积已经有了三百八十多万亩了。
    桑干河驯服了，也变美丽了。几年来，两岸人民开展了大规模的植树造林工作，冒着寒风刺骨的严冬，顶着烈暑灼人的盛夏，把一株一株的树苗种在了它的身边。现在，当年栽下的树苗已经长大成林，桑干河已披上绿装了。这河两岸长达四百多里的绿色长城，挡住了从北方吹来的漫天黄沙，保护了两岸万亩良田，又像无数张伸入地层的臂膀，抱着了那肥沃的土地不再让水冲刷，同时还为我们生长出了五十四万立方米的贵重木材。
    随着桑干河逐渐被驯服，逐渐被绿化，两岸人民的生活也不断上升。1959年不仅粮食获得大丰收，而且还破天荒的在水库内放养了几千万尾鱼苗，单单只是镇子墚一个水库就放进了一百六十九万尾，沿岸大片地方还种上了稻米，也种上了绿荫簇拥的葡萄；人们的生活不再是：莜面、山药、谷子家常饭了，如今都吃上了“雁门关外赛江南”的大米和鲜鱼。
    兴修水利，造福万年，这是桑干河流域人民长久以来的愿望。如果说1959年在三星高照下，我们在治理桑干河上获得了巨大的成就，那么1960年这条世世代代曾让人胆战心惊的害河，就要在我们这一代人手里永远驯服下来，这对于过去没有水地的雁门关外高原来说，是多么一件振奋人心的大喜事。再过一个稍微长一点的时间，那时整个桑干河流域就变成了一个多采动人的大花园了。那时候，河两岸的八百多万亩田地一片湖光山色，在碧波粼粼的稻田中，青翠欲滴的稻穗迎风摆动，阡陌万顷上的黄熟小麦，喷出醉人的芳香，朵朵粉红色的、白色的和黄色的荷花、芍药、牡丹和夜来香，仿佛把两岸村舍包在了万紫千红的花圃中，河岸上那晶莹透体的葡萄丛下，成了人们小憩乘凉最惬意的地方；两岸高大的林带将给人们提供丰富的木材，两岸那肥美的草滩将为人们繁殖更多的牛羊，两岸那像镜面似的水库湖心将为人们养育数不清吃不尽的鲜鱼；入夜，当发电机启动，两岸千家万户那闪烁的电灯，好像给大地镶上了千万颗夜明珠。假日里，人们还可坐在小汽艇上随波逐流，看两岸那无边无际的大好河山，听两岸那唱不完的动人山歌。这时，如果你要跟孩子们说起什么：“雁门关外野人家，不养蚕丝不种麻……”的时候，他们一定会感到茫然了。
    桑干河两岸的一百万人民是英雄的人民，他们正按照党中央和毛主席亲手制定的社会主义建设的总蓝图，建设着自己美丽富庶的家乡。
