The People's Daily News report: "Can production continue to leap forward?" The Tianjin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, after a major debate, received a positive answer.

This factory is an advanced collective that attended the National Congress of Heroes. In 1959, it exceeded its plan every month, with each quarter surpassing the previous one. By December 5th of last year, it had comprehensively completed the national plan ahead of schedule. On the basis of the overall leap forward, this factory formulated a continued leap forward plan for this year, proposing to increase production by 1% every ten days and establish a new norm of steadily increasing production. However, at this time, some people raised the idea that "potential has been exhausted." Some cadres believed that years of leap forward had almost exhausted the potential; under the conditions of insufficient labor, raw materials, and equipment, it was difficult to achieve a ten-day increase and they could only carry out balanced production at the existing level. In response to these ideological situations, the Party committee immediately launched a mass airing of views, big debate among all employees.

During the debate, many people recalled the past. Someone said, "If we talk about difficulties, the difficulties in the first quarter of last year were numerous!" At that time, the factory had temporary difficulties in production due to a shortage of raw materials such as coal and caustic soda. As a result, the Party committee secretary and the factory director led all the employees to search for coke slag, cottonseed hulls, sawdust, coal kernels, coal bricks, etc., discarded in various corners for substitutes; organized workers to extract caustic soda from white ash residue in waste pits. After overcoming difficulties in every possible way, the first quarter changed from production reduction to production increase, completing the quarterly production plan one day ahead of schedule. Someone also said: "Turning over the old accounts does not mean solving the problem of production leap forward. What about the reserves of two hundred and seventy-odd kinds of raw materials? Caustic soda alone requires five tons a day. How to solve it?" When raw materials were mentioned, the supply and marketing personnel made an authoritative statement: After thorough inventory and careful calculation, they believed that they were confident in reserving sufficient raw materials. The problem was whether to sit at home and shout about difficulties or to actively take measures. While participating in the debate, the supply and marketing personnel held meetings late into the night and took active actions. After contacting and linking up with relevant departments, they had already signed supply contracts for major raw materials such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and industrial salt. Some of them were purchasing in other places and also discovered usable liquid alkali; this raw material could guarantee a monthly supply of one hundred and twenty-four tons; they also heard that steel plants used caustic soda for desulfurization, and immediately asked technical personnel to experiment with extracting caustic soda from waste steel slag, and the experiment has now been successful. A large amount of waste steel slag has opened up a new raw material base for them. At present, in addition to nine raw materials that are still being contacted, there is sufficient guarantee for the other two hundred and sixty-odd raw materials. After specific analysis and clarifying the facts one by one, the view that insufficient raw material supply could not sustain the leap forward was deemed untenable.

Was the difficulty in labor? Everyone calculated again, and the answer was that the potential was infinite. After two years of production leap forward, they found the biggest trick to save manpower - vigorously carrying out technical innovation. Someone calculated that from January to November of last year, all employees of the factory put forward more than 9,000 technical innovation suggestions; after sorting out, more than 6,100 were adopted, and more than 5,700 were realized. As a result, the labor productivity from January to November increased by 11% compared with the previous year. Someone also cited a recent fact: By slightly adjusting the labor organization and improving some equipment and operating methods, the entire factory saved 5% of the labor force at once. While participating in the debate, workshop workers combined it with production, and put forward 179 innovation suggestions in just a few days. The workers in the dyeing and chemical workshop who watched the water washing machines improved the equipment, expanding from one person watching two machines to watching three machines, and this process immediately saved one-third of the labor force. Workers in the dyeing group suggested that as long as the dyeing tank was enlarged and an automatic mixer was added, all fifteen dyeing workers could be saved. The workers in the drying team only installed a small shaft on the drying machine, which changed the original method of feeding cloth from one end and dropping it from the other to feeding and dropping at the same end at the same time. In this way, one person could operate the drying machine that was originally watched by two people. After this experience was widely promoted, another twenty-six people could be saved. After presenting the facts and calculating the details in this way, the factory not only does not need to increase the labor force this year, but also can draw more than twenty technical workers to support other places in the first quarter.

"How to solve the difficulty of unbalanced equipment?" After the debate, many people talked about the time in 1953 when most of the factory was operating manually, the equipment was unbalanced, and now the mechanization and even the future automation still need to constantly balance the equipment. Some people also listed the current situation. According to the production key points of the entire factory, the "three-way combination" scientific research team composed of cadres, technicians and veteran workers has formulated a research project to realize 54 production automation projects and 12 major technical innovation measures this year; three of them have already been realized.

The caustic soda evaporation equipment, which was originally considered to be weak, not only solved the problem of alkali leakage by modifying the vacuum tube, but also increased the evaporation efficiency by 5%-20%; the three self-made indigenous water washing machines and simple alkali steaming equipment made by the workers were also being installed. In coordination with the equipment balancing work, the maintenance workers also changed the old rules of only using holidays to repair machines, carefully arranged the maintenance plan, and used all opportunities such as product changes to carry out maintenance. In early December, they and the weaving workers jointly repaired the machines and completed more than 130 key maintenance projects planned and arranged.

These facts have become powerful materials in the debate, and the views that manpower, raw materials, and equipment difficulties cannot sustain the leap forward have been dispelled.

A debate has established the confidence of all employees in the continuous leap forward of production, and even some people who once emphasized difficulties have now joined the ranks of striving for excellence. Now, from the sections to the workshops, from the production workers to the auxiliary workers, all have made new measures. Everyone in the factory knows the key points, big and small, and everyone has a place to go, laying a solid ideological and material foundation for this year's continued leap forward.

### 辩论增信心　全厂皆上游  天津染织厂为继续跃进打下牢靠的思想物质基础

    辩论增信心　全厂皆上游
    天津染织厂为继续跃进打下牢靠的思想物质基础
    本报讯　“生产能不能持续跃进？”天津市染织厂经过一场大辩论，得到了肯定的回答。
    这个厂是出席全国群英会的先进集体，1959年月月超额完成计划，一季高过一季。到去年12月5日提前全面完成了国家计划。在全面跃进的基础上，这个厂制订了今年的继续跃进计划，提出旬旬增加1％、建立生产步步上升的新常规。但是这时候却有人提出了“潜力到头”的说法。有的干部认为连年跃进已经把潜力挖得差不多了；在劳动力、原料材料和设备不足的情况下，只能按照现有水平进行均衡生产，很难作到旬旬上升。党委针对这些思想情况，立即发动全体职工展开大鸣大放大辩论。
    辩论中，很多人回忆了过去。有人说：“如果提困难的话，去年第一季度的困难可多啦！”当时这个厂曾因为缺少煤和火碱等原材料，生产上发生了暂时的困难。结果呢，党委书记和厂长领导全厂职工到处去搜集废弃在各个角落里的焦炭渣、棉籽皮、锯末、煤核、煤砖等进行代用；组织工人从废坑中挖白灰渣子来提炼火碱。经过千方百计地克服困难，第一季度反而变减产为增产，提前一天完成了季度生产计划。有人又说：“翻过去的账，不等于解决了生产跃进问题，二百七十多种原料材料的储备怎么办？光火碱一天就需要五吨，如何解决？”提到原材料，供销人员作了权威的发言：经过彻底清仓和细致的测算，认为储备足够的原材料是有把握的，问题在于是坐在家里喊困难呢，还是积极采取措施。供销人员在参加辩论的同时，他们连夜开会，积极行动。经过和有关部门联系挂钩，现在已经签订了棉纱、棉布、工业用盐等主要原材料的供应合同。有的在外地采购，还发现了可以利用的液体碱；这种原料每月可保证供应一百二十四吨；他们又听说钢厂采用火碱去硫，当即请技术人员试验用废钢渣提炼火碱，现在已试验成功。大量的废钢渣又给他们开拓了新的原料基地。目前，除了有九种原料材料正在继续联系外，其他二百六十多种原料材料已经有了充分的保证。经过具体分析，摆清一桩一桩的事实以后，认为原料材料供应不足不能持续跃进的观点站不住脚了。
    困难在劳动力上吗？大家又算了一笔账，答案是潜力无穷无尽，经过两年生产大跃进的锻炼，他们找到了节省人力的最大窍门——大搞技术革新。有人统计了一下，去年1到11月份，全厂职工共提出了九千多件技术革新建议；经过整理采纳的六千一百多件，实现了五千
  七百多件。结果1至11月份的劳动生产率比前年提高了11％。有人又举出最近的一件事实：稍微调整了一下劳动组织，并改进一些设备和操作方法，全厂一次就节省了5％的劳动力。车间工人边参加辩论，边结合生产，短短几天就提出了一百七十九项革新建议。染化车间看水洗机台的工人改进了一下设备，由原来一个人看两台扩大为看三台，这道工序马上就节省了三分之一的劳动力。压染组工人提出只要加大化色箱和加个自动搅拌器，就可以把十五名化色工人全部节省下来。烘干小组的工人只在烘干机上安了个小轴，就使原来由一头进布另一头落布改为同时在一头进落，这一来，两个人看管的烘干机，一个人就能操作。把这一经验普遍推广以后，又能节约二十六人。经过这样摆事实、算细账，全厂今年不但不需要再增加劳动力，而且第一季度还可抽出二十多名技术工人支援外地。
    “设备不平衡的困难怎么解决呢？”经过辩论，许多人谈到1953年这个厂绝大部分是手工操作的时候，设备就不平衡，现在机械化以至将来的自动化，仍旧需要不断平衡设备。有的人还列举了目前的情况，根据全厂的生产关键，由干部、技术人员和老工人组成的“三结合”科学研究组，这个组已经制订出今年实现五十四项生产自动化的研究项目，十二项重大的技术革新措施；现在有三项已经实现了。
    原来被认为力量薄弱的火碱蒸发设备，通过改装真空管，不仅解决了跑碱的问题，而且提高蒸发效率5％—20％；工人们自制的三台土造水洗机和简易的蒸碱设备也正在安装。配合着设备平衡工作，保全工人也一改过去只利用假日进行检修机器的老规矩，细致地安排了检修计划，利用产品变化等一切机会进行检修。12月上旬他们和挡车工人一道检修了机器，完成了一百三十多项计划安排的重点检修项目。
    这些事实都成了辩论中的有力材料，认为人力、原材料、设备困难不能持续跃进的观点破除了。
    一场辩论使全厂职工树立了生产持续跃进的信心，就连曾强调困难的一些人，现在也投入力争上游的行列。现在从科室到车间、从生产工人到辅助工人，全部订了新措施。全厂大小关键人人心中有数，个个都有着落，为今年的继续跃进打下了牢靠的思想、物质基础。
