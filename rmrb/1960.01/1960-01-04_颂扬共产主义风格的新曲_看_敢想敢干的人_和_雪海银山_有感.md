A New Song Praising Communist Style
    — Thoughts on "People Who Dare to Think and Act" and "Snow Sea Silver Mountain"
    Jin Mei
    Recently, when I saw the first feature film "People Who Dare to Think and Act" produced by Shandong Film Studio and the feature film "Snow Sea Silver Mountain" produced by Xi'an Film Studio, I couldn't help but applaud! You should know that these two film studios were born not long ago, but they have produced films with a certain ideological level and artistic quality for us. This is a fresh sprout, a gratifying harvest, born from the spring breeze of the Great Leap Forward, shining under the light of the Party's General Line.
      The protagonist of "People Who Dare to Think and Act," Zhang Yingjie, is a young carpenter in the butt-joint workshop of a lumber mill. The production tasks of this workshop relied on cumbersome manual operations, and they were always unable to complete their tasks. Zhang Yingjie, who dared to think and act, believed that only by vigorously carrying out technological innovation, improving tools, and adopting machine operations, as instructed by the Party, could labor efficiency be improved and workers be liberated from heavy physical labor. Therefore, he stubbornly tried to develop an electric butt-joint machine. Although the well-meaning workshop director, due to his more serious conservative ideas, only considered the immediate, temporary benefits and not only did not support Zhang Yingjie but also thought that Zhang Yingjie's innovation was a deviation from the right path, a waste of manpower and resources, and an expression of individual heroism. When he sought technical guidance from the chief engineer, the latter did not believe in the power of the working masses today and dared not boldly help him. But no setback discouraged him. He believed that as long as it was for the collective cause, following the direction indicated by the Party, working hard and cleverly, and being with the masses, there was nothing to fear, and even the greatest difficulties could be overcome. So he worked actively with Xiao Yao, with the selfless help of Master Li. Thanks to the Party committee's meticulous care and support, after three months of day and night research, twenty-eight experiments, and unremitting struggle against backward conservative ideas, they finally succeeded in creating an electric butt-joint machine, increasing work efficiency dozens of times. The facts educated those with conservative ideas and made Zhang Yingjie understand even more this truth: people created the word "difficulty" in order to conquer it. As long as it is for the collective cause, relying on the leadership of the Party, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. His mother said to him with infinite joy: "Understanding this is more important than your success in creating an electric butt-joint machine." Zhang Yingjie is a hero of our times nurtured by the Party, and the film reflects the great spirit of our times.
    "Snow Sea Silver Mountain" describes the story of Zhang Xiufang, a cotton-growing expert famous throughout Shaanxi Province, selflessly helping Li Chunlan, who is challenging her in production.
    Li Chunlan, a young female team leader, under the guidance of the Party branch secretary, led more than a dozen girls to cultivate a "high-yield cotton experimental field." Chunlan was determined to compete with Zhang Xiufang, a cotton-growing expert from a neighboring commune, and proposed the slogan: "I won't get married until I catch up with Zhang Xiufang!"
    They cultivated enthusiastically and diligently. But Chunlan's heart was not at ease! Cotton grew wildly, and cotton buds and bolls kept falling off. Chunlan felt helpless in the face of difficulties. The Party branch secretary enlightened her: "You proposed to catch up with Zhang Xiufang, but have you thought about asking Zhang Xiufang to give you some guidance?" This untied the knot in Chunlan's mind. She decided to cross the river to ask Zhang Xiufang for guidance to find out the root cause of the cotton bud and boll shedding. But her plan was opposed by some team members who did not understand the meaning of socialist production competition: "Why must we ask Zhang Xiufang to come? You know she is our competitor, and she would love for us to fail! She will definitely not come!" However, Li Chunlan firmly believed that Zhang Xiufang would come, because engaging in competition and striving for red flags was not for personal honor but for the collective cause of socialism.
    Sure enough, Zhang Xiufang, who was returning from a meeting in the county, immediately went straight to Li Chunlan's place without going home when she heard that there was a problem with Li Chunlan's cotton. At this time, some commune members stopped her from going, saying dissatisfiedly: "What kind of competition is this? Let's just give the red flag to Li Chunlan!" Zhang Xiufang used her spirit of cooperation to promptly persuade the commune members: the cotton planting technology was taught to her by the Party, and the competition is for jointly improving production. What reason is there to treat technology as private property? She crossed the river late at night and helped them find that the boll shedding was caused by insufficient fertilizer, and immediately took remedial measures. All the cotton in Chunlan's experimental field was revived, resulting in a bumper harvest of "Snow Sea Silver Mountain." At this time, Chunlan excitedly said to Zhang Xiufang: "You have given me the most precious thing, which is the communist style!" What a profound summary!
    The two films reflect the advanced ideological qualities of the heroes on our industrial and agricultural fronts from different angles, and have equally given us a communist ideological education. Both films are relatively concise, focused, and have clear lines, with each episode closely linked to the main thread of the protagonist's character development. For example, "People Who Dare to Think and Act" writes about the workers' technical inventions, but it does not use many shots to introduce the technical process of creation, but focuses on writing about Zhang Yingjie, a young worker who dares to think and act, listens to the Party, and works hard for the collective cause, and also vividly shows through the Party committee secretary Liu the Party's guidance and affectionate care for the new generation, and the advanced ideological qualities of Yingjie's unusual mother, who is both a strict father and a loving mother, as well as the ideological dynamics of the people around them. Both films also have a relatively strong atmosphere of life, especially "Snow Sea Silver Mountain" is more prominent in this regard.

    颂扬共产主义风格的新曲
    ——看“敢想敢干的人”和“雪海银山”有感
    金梅
    最近，当我看到山东电影制片厂摄制的第一部故事片“敢想敢干的人”和西安电影制片厂摄制的故事片“雪海银山”的时候，不禁拍手叫好！要知道，这两个电影制片厂诞生不久，却为我们摄制了具有一定思想水平和艺术质量的影片。这是在党的总路线光辉照耀下，大跃进这阵春风催生出的鲜嫩的新芽，可喜的收获。
      “敢想敢干的人”的主人公张英杰是木材厂对缝车间的青年木工。这个车间的生产任务靠着笨重的手工操作，老是完不成任务。敢想敢干的张英杰认为只有按照党的指示，大搞技术革新，改良工具，采用机器操作，才是提高劳动效率、从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来的正确途径，因此他顽强地试制电动对缝机。虽然好心的车间主任由于有着较严重的保守思想，只从眼前一时的利益出发，不但不支持张英杰，还认为张英杰的革新是邪道，是劳民伤财，是个人英雄主义；求助总工程师作技术指导，而他又不相信今天工人群众的力量，不敢大胆地帮助他；但是任何挫折也没有使他气馁，他认为只要是为了集体事业，按照党所指示的方向，苦干加巧干和群众在一起，就什么也不怕，再困难也会成功的。于是他和小姚在一起，在李师傅无私帮助下积极地干。由于党委无微不至的关怀和支持，他们经过三个月日夜钻研，二十八次的试验，对落后保守思想进行了不懈的斗争，终于创造成功电动对缝机，提高工效几十倍。事实教育了有保守思想的人们，也使张英杰更懂得了这个真理：人们所以创造困难这二个字，就是为了去战胜它。只要为了集体的事业，依靠着党的领导，就没有什么战胜不了的困难。他的母亲无限欣喜地对他说：“懂得这一点，比你创造成功电动对缝机更为重要。”张英杰是党培养出来的我们时代的英雄，影片反映了我们时代伟大的风貌。
    “雪海银山”，描述了陕西全省闻名的植棉能手张秀芳无私地帮助在生产上与她挑战竞赛的李春兰的故事。
    青年女队长李春兰在党支部书记的指导下，带领十多个姑娘搞了一块“棉花丰产试验田”。春兰下定决心，要和邻社的植棉能手张秀芳竞赛，并提出口号：“赶不上张秀芳不结婚”！
    她们热情勤劳地耕耘着。可是春兰的心里并不轻松啊！棉花疯长，棉蕾、棉铃不断脱落，春兰在困难面前感到没办法了。党支部书记启发她：“你提出追赶张秀芳，可是你想过请张秀芳来指导一下的事情吗？”这一下使春兰的思想疙瘩解开了。她决心过河去请张秀芳来进行指导，找出棉花脱蕾落铃的根源来。但是她的打算遭到一部分不明白社会主义生产竞赛意义的组员的反对：“为什么一定要请张秀芳来？要知道她是咱们的竞赛对手，她巴不得咱们失败呢！她一定不会来的！”但是，李春兰坚信张秀芳会来的；因为搞竞赛、争红旗不是为了个人荣誉，而是为了社会主义的集体事业。
    果然正从县里开会回来的张秀芳，一听到李春兰的棉花出了问题，马上家也不回，径直就要去到李春兰那里。这时有些社员便阻止她前去，不满意地说：“这还搞什么竞赛？干脆把红旗给李春兰吧！”张秀芳以她的协作精神，及时说服了社员：种棉花的技术是党教给自己的，竞赛是为了共同提高生产，有什么理由把技术当作私有财产呢？她深夜渡河前去，不辞辛苦地帮助她们找到了脱蕾落铃是由于肥料不足而引起的，立即采取了抢救的措施。春兰试验田里的棉花全部复活，获得了一个“雪海银山”的大丰收。这时春兰激动地对张秀芳说：“你给了我一件最宝贵的东西，那就是共产主义风格！”这是一句多么深刻的总结啊！
    两部影片从不同角度反映了我们工业和农业战线上的英雄的先进思想品质，同样让我们受到了一次共产主义的思想教育。这两部影片都比较简练、集中，脉络分明，每一情节都能紧扣着主人公的性格发展这一主线。像“敢想敢干的人”写的是工人的技术发明，可是并没有用很多的镜头去介绍创造的技术过程，而是着重去写张英杰这个敢想敢干、听党的话、为集体事业而努力的青年工人，也通过党委刘书记具体生动地看到了党对新生一代的教导和亲切关怀，和英杰的既是严父又是慈母的这个不一般的母亲的先进思想品质，以及周围人们的思想动态。两部影片生活气息也比较浓，特别是“雪海银山”在这方面更为突出。
