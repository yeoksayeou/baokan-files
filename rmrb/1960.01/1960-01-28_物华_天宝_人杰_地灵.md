Bountiful Resources, Heavenly Treasures, Outstanding People, Auspicious Land
	Zuo Hai
	Six hundred million Chinese are ambitious and heroic, the East Wind prevails over the West Wind day by day.
	Bountiful resources across the nine provinces span the new nation; heavenly treasures and three wonders orchestrate great feats.
	Outstanding people rejoice to meet a healthy helmsman; auspicious land leads us to believe the origins are truly abundant.
	Relying on the power to overturn seas and move mountains, let us display our talents to rival the works of nature!

	At the arrival of the first spring in the 1960s, a news bulletin summarizing our construction achievements was published. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, our people, at a high-speed, proportionate, and great-leap-forward pace, completed the main targets of our country's Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy three years ahead of schedule, demonstrating the invincible great power of our country's general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. What an encouraging and inspiring achievement! We want to warmly praise this historical victory. Although the above short poem is far from sufficient to explain the significance of this great victory even in the slightest, I hope to use the Chinese ancient literary scholars' words "bountiful resources, heavenly treasures, outstanding people, and auspicious land," giving them new meanings, to express my enthusiastic feelings in praise of this great victory.

	Since the founding of our People's Republic of China ten years ago, especially since the Great Leap Forward began in 1958, our socialist construction has been thriving, and the people's lives and spiritual outlook have been completely renewed. How should we summarize this great historical reality? At this time, we will spontaneously and naturally think of Wang Bo, the famous young writer of the Tang Dynasty, who created the phrases "bountiful resources, heavenly treasures" and "outstanding people, auspicious land." It seems that these words are still very useful. Of course, Wang Bo's era was the very backward feudal society of the seventh century, and his understanding of objective things cannot be compared with our current understanding; when we borrow his words, we will undoubtedly fundamentally change the original meaning of these words.

	If we explain them according to our current meaning, then bountiful resources, heavenly treasures, outstanding people, and auspicious land can very appropriately reflect the characteristics of our era and the great superiority of our current political, socio-economic, and natural conditions.

	Are we not now gathering bountiful resources, with the whole country full of vibrant scenes? Ancient people only felt that all things changed endlessly, and they could not extract the essence of nature even if they wanted to, so they could only sigh in admiration. Now, we can not only make all things obey human needs, but also constantly transform all things, transform nature, and create new lives, making the human living environment more beautiful. In particular, our country has a vast territory and abundant resources. Many landscapes that cannot be encountered at the same time can often be possessed simultaneously in our country. Isn't this commendable?

	The ancients often fantasized that God would send down some treasures, or hoped that some heavenly gods would bring blessings to the world. The so-called "heavenly treasures," according to the original meaning, can be interpreted as natural treasures or as giant gods in the sky. In this way, "heavenly treasures" are not for us. Because we will never have any fantasies about gods like the ancients did, we will rely on our own strength to carry out revolution and construction, and create earth-shattering undertakings. We have our own magic weapons. This is the crystallization of countless experiences in the practice of revolution and construction. In the past period of the people's democratic revolution, we created the three magic weapons of the united front, armed struggle, and party building, and relied on these three magic weapons to achieve the victory of the revolution. Now we have found the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes from the practice of socialist construction, and have already achieved great achievements; in the future, we will continue to use these magic weapons to strive for continuous victory.

	Why are we able to create such a great cause? This should first of all be attributed to the wise leadership of our Party and Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is our great helmsman. He combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of our country's revolution and construction, forming the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The experience of China's revolution and construction proves that as long as we advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, we will surely be victorious; whoever deviates from the direction indicated by Chairman Mao will surely be defeated. Because of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have a savior; with Chairman Mao as our guide, the wisdom and intelligence of the Chinese people have the opportunity to be fully utilized. Among the 650 million Chinese people, there are countless heroes and heroines, and now they all have the opportunity to show their talents on various fronts. In this new stage of building socialism, under the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, the 600 million people have established lofty communist style and communist ambitions, and people are full of enthusiasm and soaring enthusiasm. The Party's mass line and the policy of walking on two legs have fully mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of 600 million people, enabling our country's socialist cause to develop rapidly.

	Our country, with an area of 9.6 million square kilometers, has the best natural conditions for building socialism and communism. Our country has fertile land, endless resources, and other various superior geographical and geological conditions. However, in the past, the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries tried their best to distort the facts, insisting that China could not do this or that; lacking this and lacking that. For example, they once declared that China was a country lacking copper, but in recent years we have discovered many copper mines; they also once said that China was a country lacking oil, but in recent years we have discovered many oil fields with abundant reserves. The facts fully prove that our China is truly a land of outstanding talents and boundless richness!

	Now our domestic and international situation is very good. The whole world is in an era when the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day. It can be believed that as long as we continue to exert our efforts, strive for the upstream, and rely on the great strength of the 650 million people to move mountains and overturn the sea, and further develop all the talents of the masses on the basis of the great achievements already made in the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, we will not be afraid of anything, we can do everything, and we will surely be able to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible.

    物华·天宝·人杰·地灵
    左海
    六亿神州志气雄，东风日日压西风。
    物华九土跨新国；天宝三奇奏巨功。
    人杰欣逢舵手健；地灵始信本源丰。
    好凭倒海移山力，展布群才夺化工！
    在二十世纪六十年代的第一个春天到来的时候，发表了总结我们建设成就的新闻公报。我国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的正确领导之下，以高速度的按比例的大跃进的步伐，提前三年完成了我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的主要指标，显示了我国社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的不可战胜的伟大力量。这是多么令人欢欣鼓舞的成就啊！我们要热烈地歌颂这个历史性的胜利。上面这首小诗虽然远远不足以说明这个伟大胜利的意义于万一；但是，我却希望借用我国古代文学家“物华天宝人杰地灵”这几个词，给予它以新的涵义，来表达我赞颂这个伟大胜利的热烈心情。
    从十年前我们中华人民共和国成立以来，特别是从1958年开始大跃进以来，我国的社会主义建设事业真是欣欣向荣，人民群众的生活和精神面貌完全焕然一新。我们究竟应该怎样概括这一伟大的历史现实呢？这时候，我们不期其然而自然地会想起唐朝著名的青年文学家王勃，是他创造了“物华、天宝”和“人杰、地灵”这几个词汇。现在看来，这几个词汇还是很可用的。当然，王勃所处的时代是七世纪非常落后的封建社会，他对客观事物的理解同我们现在的理解也完全不能相比；我们借用他的词汇，无疑地要根本改变这些词汇的原来意义。
    如果照我们现在的意思加以解释，那末，物华、天宝、人杰、地灵却很恰当地可以反映我们这个时代的特点，可以反映现时我国的政治条件、社会经济条件和自然条件的巨大优越性。
    我们现在难道不是物华会萃，全国到处充满着生气勃勃的景象吗？古代的人只觉得万物变化无穷，要想吸取自然界的精华而不可得，惟有赞叹不已。我们现在不但能够使万物服从于人的需要，并且能够不断地改造万物、改造自然，创造新的生活，使人类生活的环境更加美好。特别是我国地域广阔，资源丰富，许多不能同时遇见的景物，在我国常常可以同时兼而有之。这不是难能可贵的吗？
    古人常常幻想老天爷会降下什么宝贝，或者希望有什么天神会给人间降福。所谓“天宝”，照原来的意思可以解释为天然的珍宝，也可以解释为天上的巨神。这样说来，“天宝”对于我们是无缘的了。因为我们决不像古人那样对神存在什么幻想，我们要靠自己的力量进行革命和建设，创造翻天复地的事业。我们有自己的法宝。这就是革命和建设的实践过程中的无数经验的结晶。在过去人民民主革命时期，我们创造了统一战线、武装斗争和党的建设这三个法宝，并且依靠这三个法宝取得了革命的胜利。现在我们又从社会主义建设的实践中找到了总路线、大跃进和人民公社这三个法宝，并且也已经取得了巨大的成就；今后我们还将继续运用这些法宝，争取不断的胜利。
    我们为什么能够创造出这样伟大的事业呢？这首先应该归功于我们的党和毛主席的英明领导。毛主席是我们的伟大的舵手，他把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同我国革命和建设的实践相结合，形成了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。我国革命和建设的经验证明，只要按照毛主席指引的方向前进，我们就一定能够胜利；谁如果背离了毛主席所指示的方向，就一定会遭到失败。因为有了毛主席，中国人民才有了救星；有了毛主席做我们的带路人，中国人民的聪明智慧才有机会得到充分的发挥。六亿五千万的中国人民中间，有无数的英雄豪杰，现在他们在各个战线上都有机会大显身手。在这建设社会主义的新阶段，六亿人民在党和毛主席的教导下，已经树立了崇高的共产主义风格和共产主义的雄心大志，人们各个热情奔放干劲冲天。党的群众路线、两条腿走路的方针，把六亿人的积极性和创造性充分调动起来，使我国的社会主义事业飞跃地向前发展。
    拥有九百六十万平方公里面积的我国，具备了建设社会主义和共产主义的最好的自然条件。我国有富饶的土地，无尽的资源和其他各种优越的地理条件和地质条件。但是，过去帝国主义和国民党反动派极力歪曲事实，硬说中国这也不行，那也不行；缺少这个，没有那个。比如，他们曾经宣布中国是缺铜的国家，可是近年来我们却发现了许多铜矿；他们又曾经说中国是缺石油的国家，可是近年来我们却又发现了许多蕴藏丰富的油田。事实完全证明我们中国是真正毓秀钟灵无比丰饶的胜地啊！
    现在我们的国内外形势都好得很。全世界正处在东风压倒西风的时代，敌人正在一天天烂下去，我们正在一天天好起来。可以相信，只要我们在总路线、大跃进和人民公社已经取得伟大成就的基础上，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，依靠六亿五千万人民群众移山倒海的伟大力量，进一步发挥群众的一切才智，我们就什么也不怕，什么都能够办到，我们就一定能够把我国尽快地建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的强大的社会主义国家。
