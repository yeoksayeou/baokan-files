    We are victorious!
    By Chang Enshan, planer operator at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, National Advanced Producer

    Upon hearing the news that the Five-Year Plan had been completed in two years, I couldn't help but raise my arms and cheer, "We are victorious!"

    Looking back on these past two years, it's truly remarkable. The Party and Chairman Mao have led us to create so many miracles that we wouldn't have dared to imagine in the past. The imperialists are desperately attacking our General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, but we completed five years' worth of work in just two years! Which capitalist country has increased steel production from over five million tons to over thirteen million tons in two years? And which country has achieved a great agricultural harvest in a year plagued by severe droughts and floods? Only our socialist country, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, has achieved such great results. Let's see what the imperialists have to say in the face of this communique!

    Since the General Line was established, my heart has been filled with brightness. During the Great Leap Forward, I worked hard and made over seventy technical improvements. These achievements are all due to the correct leadership of the Party and the help of my comrades.

    I always keep in mind the Party's teachings: maintain and increase our drive, strive to be the best, and after a victory, strive for even greater victories. In the new year, I will work with all the comrades in the factory to overcome the difficulty of insufficient large machine tool equipment in our factory, to ensure an even greater leap forward for our factory this year.

### 我们胜利了！

    我们胜利了！
    全国先进生产者北京第一机床厂刨工  常恩山
    听到五年计划两年完成的消息，我禁不住举臂欢呼：“我们胜利了！”
    回想过去这两年，真是了不起。党和毛主席领导着我们创造了多少过去连想都不敢想的奇迹。帝国主义下死劲地攻击我们的总路线，大跃进和人民公社，可是我们五年的工作量两年就完成了！哪个资本主义国家在两年内把钢从五百多万吨提高到一千三百多万吨的？又有哪个国家在遭受了严重水旱灾害的年头，获得了农业大丰收？只有我们社会主义国家，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，有了总路线，大跃进，人民公社，才取得了这样伟大的成绩。看他们帝国主义者在公报面前还有什么话可说！
    自从有了总路线，我的心里就亮堂堂的。在大跃进中，我鼓劲向前干，改进了七十多项技术。这点成绩都是由于党的正确领导和同志们的帮助才取得的。
    我时时牢记着党的教导：干劲要一鼓再鼓，上游要一争再争，胜利了要再夺更大的胜利。在新的一年中，我要和全厂同志一起克服我厂大机床设备不足的困难，确保我们厂今年更大跃进。
