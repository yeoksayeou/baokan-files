Xinhua News Agency, January 9th: The Vice Premier of the German Democratic Republic and Minister of Foreign and Intra-German Trade, Heinrich Rau, his wife, and the entire delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic led by him, arrived in Beijing by plane at 1:30 PM today.

Vice Premiers of the State Council Li Xiannian and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and Huang Yanpei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Lin Haiyun, and others, were at the airport to warmly welcome the distinguished guests.

Members of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic included: Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Paul Verner, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Otto Winzer, and Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, Wang Dairen.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian delivered a welcoming speech at the airport. He said:

Dear Comrade Vice Premier Rau,

Dear Comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic,

Comrades and Friends:

As 1960 has just begun, we are very pleased to welcome the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Vice Premier Rau, to our capital. On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome to the distinguished guests from our fraternal country.

Our country and the German Democratic Republic are brothers in the socialist family. Both of our countries steadfastly adhere to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and internationalism, and the fundamental interests and goals of our two peoples are completely consistent. Therefore, since our two countries were founded, we have established a profound friendship. For more than a decade, this friendship has been continuously consolidated and developed. Dear Comrade Vice Premier, I am deeply convinced that your visit to our country will make a beneficial contribution to further enhancing the long-standing friendship between our two peoples and deepening our mutual cooperation.

Dear Comrades, I wish your visit a complete success.

Vice Premier Heinrich Rau then delivered a reply. He said:

Respected Comrade Vice Premier Li Xiannian,

Dear Comrades and Friends:

Please allow me, on behalf of all members of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic and in my own name, to express our sincere gratitude for your warm and friendly welcome.

I and all members of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic are particularly pleased and honored to be able to visit the great fraternal country in the Far East, the People's Republic of China, with whom we have close and unbreakable friendship. Therefore, I would like to thank the Government of the People's Republic of China once again for the invitation to the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic.

On behalf of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Government and people of the German Democratic Republic, we extend our fraternal militant salute to the Communist Party of China, the Government and people of the People's Republic of China, and wish them greater achievements in the future victorious socialist construction. In the past few years, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have achieved tremendous achievements in all aspects of social life. These achievements are unprecedented and can only be achieved in a socialist country based on Marxist-Leninist theory. We congratulate the Chinese people on achieving such a Great Leap Forward.

Since the founding of the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China, the fraternal and cooperative relations between the two countries have been continuously developed and consolidated. In the spirit of proletarian internationalism, the two countries provide each other with selfless assistance with all possible strength, and will continue to support each other in the future.

We thank the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and all the Chinese people for the help they have given us. This help is a tremendous support for our struggle against German imperialism and militarism, for striving to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys, and for resolving the West Berlin issue.

We are deeply convinced that our visit will help to further consolidate and strengthen the friendship and cooperation between our two countries.

The visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the Asian socialist brother countries—the Mongolian People's Republic, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—will further strengthen close and unbreakable friendship between the German Democratic Republic and these countries, thereby also contributing to the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Dear Comrades and Friends, please allow me to once again express my heartfelt thanks for your welcome. We look forward with pleasure to the rich and colorful days of our stay in the People's Republic of China.

Long live the powerful and invincible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the unbreakable Sino-German friendship!

Long live the People's Republic of China and the great and heroic Chinese people!

Long live world peace!

The friendly speeches of Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Premier Rau were met with wave after wave of warm applause.

Today, the flags of China and the German Democratic Republic fluttered in the wind at the capital airport. After the military band played the national anthems of the German Democratic Republic and China, Heinrich Rau, accompanied by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, reviewed the guard of honor. A group of Young Pioneers presented flowers to all the distinguished guests.

Among those who came to the airport to welcome the delegation today were heads of various departments of state organs, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life.

Officials from the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, as well as diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries stationed in China, also came to the airport to welcome the delegation.

Xinhua News Agency, January 9th: Vice Premier Li Xiannian met this evening with the Vice Premier of the German Democratic Republic and Minister of Foreign and Intra-German Trade, Heinrich Rau, and his wife, as well as the members of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic led by him: Paul Verner, Otto Winzer, Paul Wang Dairen, and their wives.

During the meeting, the hosts and guests had a cordial and friendly conversation.

    同志们，朋友们：
    当1960年刚刚开始的时候，我们能够在我国首都欢迎以劳副总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团感到非常高兴。我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向兄弟之邦的贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。
    我国和德意志民主共和国是社会主义大家庭中的兄弟，我们两国都坚持不渝地遵循着马克思列宁主义和国际主义的原则，两国人民的根本利益和奋斗目标是完全一致的。因此，我们两国从成立以来，就建立了深厚的友谊。十年多以来，这种友谊已经得到不断的巩固和发展。亲爱的副总理同志，我深信，你们这次访问我国，对进一步增进我们两国人民之间久已存在的友谊和加深我们相互之间的合作，将作出有益的贡献。

    我们深信，我们的访问必将有助于我们两国之间的友谊和合作得到进一步的巩固和加强。
    德意志民主共和国政府代表团在亚洲社会主义兄弟国家——蒙古人民共和国、中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国——的访问，将进一步加强德意志民主共和国同这些国家的亲密的牢不可破的友谊，从而也将有助于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结一致。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，请允许我再次衷心地感谢你们的欢迎，我们满怀着愉快的心情迎接在中华人民共和国停留的丰富多彩的日子。
