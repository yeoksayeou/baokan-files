The working class of Shanghai, holding high the red flag of the General Line and singing triumphantly, took the first step in the all-round Great Leap Forward on the first workday of the 1960s, marching from victory to new victory.

	Opening the Door to "Joy"
	On January 2, 1960, the first workday, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, famous for producing precision grinders, created a miracle unprecedented in its history! Neatly arranged in the workshop were the first batch of newly completed grinders. They shone with a light gray luster, adorned with red silk ribbons, and on the lower part of the trademark, behind the year and month of manufacture, was engraved: "1960, 1". On this day, the entire plant produced six types of grinders, totaling twenty-three units, including high-precision gear grinders with performance comparable to those made in Britain. In 1960, this plant will take another big step towards high-level precision, with a production task much more arduous than last year.
	That morning, as the workers of the Second Workshop stepped into the workshop, they were greeted by a huge golden "Joy". In the last battle of the sprint last year, the workers of this workshop had already assembled fifteen grinders. On this day, as soon as they arrived, they began the final "touch-up" work, wiping their newborns clean, wrapping them in oil paper, and packing them into boxes. On this day, all the product workshops in the plant produced products.
	The workers of the Fourth Workshop were busy rushing to make the last part for the first new product of 1960 – the Y7520K long lead screw grinder. This new product can process machine tool lead screws more than one meter long, with a precision reaching one twenty-third of a human hair.
	In the history of this plant, there has never been a record of producing products on the first workday of the year. To change this situation of being slack at the beginning and tight at the end, and to achieve balanced production, after completing the 1959 national plan ahead of schedule on December 15 last month, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant immediately turned back to rush-produce parts for the January 1960 products, ensuring that "parts for the January products will be fully equipped before the end of the year, and machine tools will be produced on the first workday of 1960." These guarantees have been successfully realized.
	Now, when the first batch of grinders in January 1960 has just been born, the machining workers are already processing parts for the February products; the foundry workers are already casting parts for the March products; the designers are already designing new products for the second half of the year; truly every step is tightly linked.

	"Infants" are Growing
	Trucks loaded with various high-quality steel materials busily drove out of the factory gate; inside the rolling mill workshop, streaks of fiery red steel dragons danced; above the steelmaking workshop, wafts of auspicious clouds and mist drifted. This is the scene of the "auspicious start" of the Shanghai Fifth Steel Plant in the New Year. This steel plant, born in the Great Leap Forward two years ago, has transformed from an "infant" into a young steel giant after a year of training last year.
	This year, the Shanghai Fifth Steel Plant will produce a wider variety and greater quantity of high-quality steel and alloy steel materials to support the development of Shanghai and the nation's machinery and electrical industries towards high-level precision. On the 2nd, the rolling mill workers had to roll five steel grades and fourteen steel numbers of high-quality steel and alloy steel materials, including high-grade ball bearing steel, alloy structural steel, and carbon tool steel for making drills. To strive for a high-yield, high-quality "auspicious start," the workers lit the heating furnaces early to heat up the steel, everyone was full of energy, striving to fire the first shot of the New Year. When the overhead crane on the cooling bed broke down and was not working well, the workers braved temperatures of over one hundred degrees Celsius to manually lift the newly rolled round steel onto flatbed trucks; there were not enough people on the second rolling mill, so the workers on the first rolling mill took the initiative to help during the small break shift. As a result, in the first shift, the workers used just over four hours of actual work time to roll more than eighty tons of round steel, overfulfilling the shift's task.

	Calling on Nature to Offer Treasures
	Waves of intense electric welding arcs shone so brightly that people could barely open their eyes. In the metalworking workshop of the China Grease Factory, workers plunged into a new battle on their first day back – rushing to make various equipment for the factory's large-scale comprehensive utilization this year. On the ground, various condensers and distillers lay scattered... To achieve a better leap forward this year, the factory's employees made great ambitions, calling on nature to offer more wealth.
	The China Grease Factory, as the name suggests, seems like an oil pressing factory. In fact, it has recently become a chemical factory that comprehensively utilizes petroleum wax. Petroleum wax is a byproduct of petroleum. In the past, the China Factory used petroleum wax as a raw material to make synthetic fatty acids, which are chemical raw materials that can replace edible vegetable oil to make various industrial products. Not long ago, in the midst of a vigorous technical innovation campaign, they also discovered that a large amount of waste gas flew away during the petroleum wax processing. The workers used many methods to capture it back and successfully trial-produced many useful chemical raw materials.
	Walking into this factory, everywhere is a busy scene. Many new equipment for comprehensive utilization of petroleum wax, some are being installed, and some have already been put into production. Outside the workshop, several large pots, originally with exhaust pipes like chimneys on top, have now been bent over by the workers and inserted into the adjacent condensers. The waste gas is condensed back into liquid. Inside the workshop, the workers reheated and distilled it again. As the temperature slowly rose, these liquids interestingly separated into several different colors, one after another flowing out. The first to come out was valeric acid, the color was so light that it was almost like clear water, and the last to come out was capric acid, which was as dark as a cup of black tea. These things are important raw materials for fragrance factories, some of which, after reprocessing, are worth as much as one hundred yuan per kilogram. In the past, these things constantly flew away in large quantities every day. Now that the factory is recovering and comprehensively utilizing a large amount of them, it can save the country a large amount of foreign exchange.
	The China Grease Factory's large-scale comprehensive utilization has already increased the country's production by 150,000 yuan in the past two months. Having tasted this sweetness, the workers are preparing to work hard and do exceptionally well this year. After all the new equipment being processed in the metalworking shop is installed, this factory can increase the production of nearly one million yuan of chemical raw materials this year. The output value of this factory in 1958 and 1959 was equivalent to 260% of the previous year. When discussing this year's plan, the workers all determined to achieve another 260% this year through comprehensive utilization, without increasing the factory's buildings and manpower. Three leap forward years, winning all three titles.

	Supporting Agricultural Technical Transformation
	At 3:00 PM on the 2nd, in the workshop of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, diesel engines supporting agricultural modernization were neatly arranged on the final assembly line. The workers on the test benches were nervously testing each diesel engine, ensuring that the quality of each diesel engine leaving the factory was fully qualified.
	At the end of last year, after the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory completed the national plan fully eleven days ahead of schedule, the entire factory, under the slogan of "Supporting Agriculture to Achieve Modernization," rushed to complete more than 30,000 horsepower of diesel engines in the last ten days; at the same time, they also made preparations for this year's auspicious start. Although there are four fewer workdays in January this year, in order not to miss the farming season, the output for this month will be 4% higher than the highest month in history – last December. Two-thirds of the diesel engines produced by the entire factory in January will be supplied to rural areas.
	At the time of starting work in the early morning, the workers braved the severe cold to arrive at the workshop, everyone was full of energy, and they were determined to create new records as soon as they started work. The hexagonal car team of the diesel engine workshop wanted to complete the January production task, and according to the new quota that was increased by 20% compared to last year, there was still a 50% shortfall in working hours. They had already held a meeting at the end of December to study technical innovation methods. After the day shift workers started work, they implemented ten technical innovation measures within four hours, breaking the new quota by an average of 20%. The output of each team in the blank workshop also increased by 10% to 20% respectively.
	In the new diesel engine workshop that was completed last year, the preparation work for the batch production of 135 series diesel engine series products is being accelerated. These products have high efficiency and low power consumption when taken to rural areas. One of the forty-horsepower diesel engines is specially designed for rural areas and can be carried by two people. The design, process route, design and manufacturing of processing equipment for these products were all developed through "three combinations", greatly shortening the time to put them into production.

	New Leap Forward, New Style
	At 10:00 PM on New Year's Eve, the first workday of the New Year for the famous Yi Shijuan team of the No. 2 State Cotton Mill began. As soon as the red light for starting the car turned on, the machines operated at a high speed of more than 400 revolutions. The female workers ran around quickly and nimbly, tapping the rub rail. The spindles did not shake their heads, the bobbins did not jump, and occasionally there was a broken end. They only had to gently lift it with their hands, and the end was connected, and the yarn was wound around the rapidly rotating spindle again. The machine was tamed. On this day, the Yi Shijuan team not only achieved a prosperous start in production, but also achieved full house red for everyone, and everyone became a "skilled worker".
	The Yi Shijuan team, which has completed its plan month after month for eighty consecutive months, held high the red flag of communism on the first day of 1960, helping each other and advancing together. There was a worker in this team named Wang Qun who was slow in her movements and could not keep up with the advanced workers for a long time. Under the slogan of not letting a companion fall behind, the comrades helped her to attack the key points, patiently and enthusiastically correcting every small movement of hers time after time, day after day. On New Year's Day 1960, she finally reached the level of a skilled worker. This team not only made everyone in their own team reach the level of a skilled worker, but also drew out Wang Guiying and Zhou Huifang, who had the best skills, to help other workshops train more than 100 skilled workers.
	Even at this moment of seizing the auspicious start, they still did not forget to help others. They found that the first group of machines in the opposite alley had many broken ends and a lot of white flowers, making it difficult to make a living, so they immediately sent someone to help. Yi Shijuan also helped them connect the ends while helping to repair the machines. On this day, both groups achieved a "prosperous start".

	Paving the Way for a New Leap Forward
	While people were celebrating the New Year, on the thirty-two docks on both sides of the Huangpu River, cars did not stop and people did not rest, appearing even busier than usual. More than 10,000 dockworkers used the good news of a "prosperous start" to kick off the prelude to the continued leap forward in 1960.
	Large ocean-going freighters, small iron barges, and motorized sailing ships were connected end to end, close to the dock. Various types of loading and unloading machinery roared day and night. On this side, the ship's derricks were like open arms, unloading pig iron, coal, ore, salt... These are the New Year's gifts from various places supporting Shanghai's industrial production. On the other side, cranes slowly hoisted bullhead planers, vertical drills, motors, and transformers packed in wooden boxes into the ship's hold, preparing for export, adding new equipment for the continued leap forward of industrial and mining enterprises in various places this year. Merchandise, cotton cloth, underwear, and recreational supplies, these materials for supplying urban and rural people to celebrate the Spring Festival, were also loaded onto ships about to set sail in batches. The indigenous machinery and indigenous tools created by dockworkers in the technical revolution showed great power. The self-made trailers, fully loaded with goods, raced back and forth. The indigenous grabs grabbed more than one ton of coal with one opening and closing, increasing the efficiency of the work team that had always used nets by about four times.
	The New Year's docks were filled with joy. The big red good news of workers creating new loading and unloading records was posted on the wall, dazzling the eyes. The radio loudspeakers constantly broadcast the news of which team had seized the "prosperous start" and which squadron had won the full house red. In the first loading and unloading area, crane driver Miao Guanghua and his apprentice Tang Yujiang used five and a half hours on New Year's Day to load 700 tons of coal onto an iron barge, shortening the original plan by two and a half hours, creating a new record for loading coal on iron barges. In the third loading and unloading area, the seventeen loading and unloading workers of the Fang Xilin team worked as two people, unusually adopting the method of unloading iron at two hatches at the same time. In the eight hours from late night on the 1st to early morning on the 2nd, they unloaded 694 tons of native iron from the "Zhongxing No. 9" ship, nearly doubling the original plan. The loading and unloading workers made an extraordinary start to 1960 with their heroic labor. From 10:00 PM on New Year's Eve last year to 2:00 PM on January 2 this year, in forty hours, the port of Shanghai loaded a total of 80,000 tons of cargo and unloaded 120,000 tons, an increase of more than 7% compared to the average loading and unloading volume per forty hours in December last year.

    第一个工作日
    本报驻上海记者
    高举着总路线红旗高歌前进的上海工人阶级，在六十年代的第一个工作日，迈开了全面跃进的步伐，从胜利走向新的胜利。
        开门见“喜”
    1960年，第一个工作日——1月2日，出产精密磨床著名的上海机床厂创造了历史上从来未有过的奇迹！车间里整整齐齐地排列着新完工的第一批磨床。它们浑身闪烁着浅灰色的光采，佩戴着红绸彩花，下部商标上出厂年月的后面，刻着：“1960、1”。这一天，全厂出产了六种共二十三台磨床，其中还有性能赶上英国的高精度齿轮磨床。1960年，这个厂又要向高级精密的方向跨很大一步，生产任务比去年要繁重得多。
    这天清早，第二车间工人一跨进车间大门，迎面而来的就是一个巨大的金色的“喜”。在去年最后一场突击战中，这个车间的工人就已经装配好十五台磨床，这天一赶来，就对着它们作最后的“补漆”工作，把他们的新生儿擦得清清爽爽，包上油纸，装好箱。这一天，全厂各个产品车间都出产了产品。
    第四车间的工人，正在忙着为1960年的第一台新产品——y7520Ｋ长丝杆磨床赶制最后一个零件。这台新产品可以加工一米多长的机床丝杆，精密度达到一根头发丝的二十三分之一。
    在这个厂的历史上，还从来不曾有过一年第一个工作日就出产品的记载。为了改变这种前松后紧的情况，做到均衡生产，上海机床厂职工在上月15日提前全面完成1959年国家计划以后，立即回过头来突击1960年产品的零件，保证“在年底前就配齐1月份产品的零件，1960年的第一个工作日就出机床”。这些保证已经胜利地实现了。
    现在，当1960年1月份的第一批磨床才诞生的时候，加工工人已经在加工2月份的产品零件；翻砂工人已经在翻砂3月份的产品零件；设计人员已经在设计下半年的新产品了；真是步步扣得很紧。
    “婴儿”在成长
    满载着各种优质钢材的卡车，忙碌地驶出工厂大门；轧钢车间里面，飞舞着一条条火红的钢龙；炼钢车间上空，飘荡着一阵阵祥云霭雾。这是上海第五钢铁厂新年“开门红”的情景。这个在前年大跃进中诞生的钢厂，经过去年一年的锻炼，已从一个“婴儿”变成一位年青的钢铁巨人。
    上钢五厂今年要生产品种更多、数量更大的各种优质钢和合金钢钢材，来支援上海和全国机电等工业向高级、精密方向发展。2日这天，轧钢工人要轧制五个钢种、十四种钢号的优质钢和合金钢钢材，其中有高级滚珠轴承钢、合金结构钢、制造钻头用的碳素工具钢。为了争取高产优质“开门红”，工人们早早地就点火把烘钢炉烧旺，人人干劲冲天，争取打响新年第一炮。冷床上行车发生故障不好使，工人们冒着摄氏一百多度高温，把刚轧成的元钢用人力抬到平板车上去；二道轧机上人手不够，首道轧机上的工人利用小调班休息时间，主动去帮助上钢。结果，第一班中，工人们用四个多小时的实际作业时间，就轧制出八十多吨元钢，超计划完成了本班任务。
    叫大自然献宝
    一阵阵强烈的电焊弧光，照得人的眼睛都睁不开。中华油脂厂的冷作工场里，工人们第一天上班，就投入了一场新的战斗——为自己工厂今年大搞综合利用赶制各种设备。场地上，横七竖八地躺着各种冷凝器蒸馏器……为了实现今年更好的跃进，这个厂的职工们立下雄心大志，叫大自然献出更多的财富。
    中华油脂厂，看名字，像是个榨油厂。其实，这里最近已经变成一个综合利用石腊的化学工厂了。石腊，是石油的副产品，中华厂过去用石腊当原料制成的合成脂肪酸，是一种可以代替食用植物油做各种工业品的化工原料。不久前，他们在大闹技术革新中，又发现在石腊处理过程中，还有大量废气飞走。工人们用许多办法把它抓了回来，重新用来试制成功了许多有用的化工原料。
    走进这个工厂，到处是一番忙碌的景象。许多综合利用石腊的新设备，有的正在安装，有的已经投入生产。车间外面几个大锅子，顶上原来有根像烟囱似的排气管，现在被工人们弯了过来，插进了旁边的冷凝器，废气经过冷凝又变成了液体。车间里面，工人们又重新把它回热蒸馏。只见温度慢慢上升，这些液体又有趣地分成几种不同颜色，一种接一种地流出来。最先出来的是戊酸，颜色淡得简直和清水差不多，最后出来的癸酸，就深得像杯红茶。这些东西都是香料厂的重要原料，有的经过再处理，一公斤的价值高达一百多元。而在过去，这些东西每天不断大量飞走。现在这个厂大量回收综合利用后，就可以节省国家大批外汇。
    中华油脂厂大搞综合利用，最近两个多月已经给国家增产了十五万元的产品。尝到了这个甜头，工人们准备今年大干而特干。正在冷作场里加工的新设备全部安装起来后，今年这个厂就可以增产近百万元的化工原料。这个厂，1958、1959两年的产值都相当于前一年的260％。工人们在讨论今年计划时，都决心要在不增加厂房和人力的情况下，通过综合利用，今年再来一个260％。三个跃进年，连中它三元。
    支援农业技术改造
    2日下午三点钟，在上海柴油机厂的车间里，一台台支援农业现代化的柴油机已经整齐地排列在总装配线上。试车台上的工人紧张地对每一台柴油机进行试车，保证出厂的柴油机台台质量完全合格。
    去年年底，上海柴油机厂提前十一天全面完成了国家计划以后，全厂上下在“支援农业实现现代化”的口号下，在最后的十天突击完成了三万多马力柴油机；同时，又为今年的开门红做好了准备。今年1月份虽然要少四个工作日，为了不误农时，这个月的产量又要比历史上最高的一个月——去年12月还要高出4％。1月份全厂生产的柴油机中，有三分之二是供应农村的。
    凌晨上工的时间，工人们冒着严寒赶到车间，个个精神饱满，一上班就决心创新纪录。柴油机车间六角车小组要完成1月份生产任务，按照今年比去年提高20％的新定额计算，还差50％的工时。他们早在12月底就开会研究了技术革新办法。日班工人上班以后在四个小时内就实现了十条技术革新措施，平均突破新定额20％。毛坯车间各个小组的产量也都分别提高10％到20％。
    在去年落成的柴油机新车间里，成批生产135型柴油机系列化产品的准备工作正在加速进行。这种产品拿到农村去，效率很高，耗电很省，其中有一种四十马力的柴油机是专门为农村设计的，两个人可以抬着走。这些产品在设计、工艺路线、加工设备的设计和制造方面，都是通过“三结合”搞出来的，大大缩短了投入生产的时间。
    新的跃进　新的风格
    元旦夜里十点钟，国棉二厂著名的裔式娟小组新年第一个劳动日开始了。开车的红灯一亮，机器就以四百转以上的高度运转，女工们在轻快、敏捷地跑着巡回，打着擦板。锭子不摇头，筒管不跳动，偶而有根断头，她们只要用手轻轻一拎，头接上了，纱又绕在飞快运转的纱锭上。机器被驯服了。这一天，裔式娟小组不仅做到生产开门红，而且做到人人满堂红，人人成为“能手”。
    连续八十个月，月月完成计划的裔式娟小组，在1960年第一天就高举共产主义红旗，互相帮助，共同前进。这个小组有个工人叫王群，动作慢，长久赶不上先进工人，在不让一个同伴掉队的口号下，同志们帮助她攻关键，一次次，一天天耐心地热情地纠正她每一个小动作。1960年元旦，她终于达到能手水平。这个小组不单是自己组里人人达到能手水平，而且还抽出技术最好的王桂英、周慧芳帮助别的车间培养了一百多名能手。
    就在这夺取开门红的时刻，她们仍念念不忘帮助别人。她们发现对面弄堂的第一组的机台断头多，白花多，生活不好做，就立刻派人去相帮。裔式娟还一边帮助他们接头一边帮忙检修机器，这一天两个组都实现了“开门红”。
    为新的跃进开路
    当人们正在欢庆新年的时候，黄浦江两岸三十二个码头上，车不停，人不歇，显得比平时更为忙碌。一万多码头工人用“开门红”的捷报，揭开了1960年继续跃进的序幕。
    上万吨的大海轮、小型的铁驳船、机帆船，首尾相接，紧靠码头。各种各样的装卸机械，日夜轰鸣。这一边，轮船吊杆像张开的两臂，从船上卸下生铁、煤炭、矿石、食盐……这是各地支援上海工业生产的新年礼物。那一头，起重机把装在木箱里的牛头刨床、立式钻床、电动机、变压器，缓缓地吊进船舱准备外运，为各地工矿企业今年继续跃进增添新的装备。百货、棉布、内衣、文娱用品，这些供应城乡人民欢度春节的物资，也一批批装上即将出航的轮船。码头工人在技术革命中创造的土机械、土工具，大显威风。他们自制的拖车，满载货物来回奔驰。土抓斗一张一合，就抓起一吨多煤炭，比历来使用网络的工班效率提高四倍左右。
    新年的码头上，喜气洋洋。工人们创造装卸新纪录的大红喜报贴在墙上，耀人眼目。广播喇叭里，不时传出哪个小组夺取了“开门红”、哪个中队获得了满堂红的消息。在第一装卸区，吊车司机苗广华和徒弟唐裕江，元旦那天用五个半小时给一艘铁驳船装了七百吨煤，比原定计划缩短两个半小时，创造了铁驳船装煤的新纪录。在第三装卸区，方锡林小组的十七个装卸工人，一个顶两个，破例采取两个舱口同时卸铁的办法。在1日深夜到2日清晨的八小时里，他们从“中兴九号”轮卸下了六百九十四吨土铁，比原计划多了将近一倍。装卸工人用自己的英勇劳动为1960年作出了一个不平凡的开端。从去年除夕晚上十点钟到今年1月2日下午两点的四十个小时里，上海港一共装了八万吨货，卸了十二万吨，比去年12月份每四十小时的平均装卸量增加7％以上。
