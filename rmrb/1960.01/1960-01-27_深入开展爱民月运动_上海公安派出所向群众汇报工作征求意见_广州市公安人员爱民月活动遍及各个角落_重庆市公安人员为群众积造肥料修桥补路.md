    Deeply Launch the Loving-the-People Month Movement
    Shanghai Public Security Police Stations Report Work to the Masses and Solicit Opinions
    Loving-the-People Month Activities of Guangzhou Public Security Personnel Spread to Every Corner

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 26th: Public security organs at all levels in Shanghai are deeply carrying out the Loving-the-People Month movement and have already achieved significant results.
    During the Loving-the-People Month movement, all public security bureau police stations reported their work to the masses and solicited opinions. The broad masses of citizens, with the attitude of masters of the country, while praising many good comrades who have served the people loyally for a long time, also put forward sincere criticisms of individual public security personnel who had shortcomings in their style. Public security personnel who were praised by the masses said that they would more humbly accept the supervision of the masses and better safeguard the interests of the country and the people. Individual public security personnel who were criticized also sincerely expressed their determination to correct their mistakes to the masses, and some even visited the masses who made suggestions to make self-criticisms.
    During the Loving-the-People Month movement, Shanghai public security personnel did everything possible to do good deeds for the people. On January 9th, Qin Xingfa, a policeman from the Changsha Road Police Station, went to the second floor of 141 Shanhai Pass Road for some business and discovered that He A'e, a woman in her seventies, and two children were unconscious due to gas poisoning, one of whom, a four-year-old girl, had stopped breathing and was covered in feces. After discovering this, Qin Xingfa immediately carried all three people downstairs, hired a pedicab to take them to the hospital, and after emergency treatment, all three were out of danger. A female police officer from the Penglai Road Police Station helps a sick, single old lady buy groceries, make hot water, and clean the room every day, and also accompanies the old lady to the hospital for medical treatment. Many police stations also adhere to the system of accepting household registrations at home, which is convenient for residents.
    The good service attitude of the public security personnel has further strengthened their relationship with the people. There is a sixty-year-old Zhao old lady on Yan'an Middle Road who is always helped across the road by the police when she goes to the market to buy groceries. She is very touched. Recently, the police received a letter from her, which read: "The people's police treat me with such care and concern, which makes me feel that socialist life is becoming more and more happy." In the Yan'an Middle Road, Beijing East Road and other areas, some residents also publicize the deeds of public security personnel loving the people in the form of storytelling and living newspapers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 26th: The Loving-the-People Month activities carried out by Guangzhou public security personnel have spread to every corner of the city. This movement started on January 16th.
    At 2:05 a.m. on the 16th, two directors of the Liwan Police Station were working under the lights when suddenly a neighborhood woman ran in as if flying, announcing, "A woman is giving birth in the women's restroom!" The two directors immediately went to find ways to help the woman get out of danger. They braved the wind and rain to go to the hospital to ask for an ambulance, but unfortunately the ambulance had already left; so they went to the health center to ask for help, and woke up two policemen, carried a stretcher to pick up the woman. When they arrived at the scene, the baby had been born for more than twenty minutes and the woman was unconscious. They first covered the mother and child with their own cotton coats and quilts, and then immediately sent the woman and baby to the health center, saving two lives that were in danger. On this day, Guangzhou public security personnel not only did many good deeds to help those in need and rescue those in distress, but also went to the blind factory to help the blind people with cleaning, went to the nursing home to clean up the environment for the elderly, helped passengers carry luggage and take care of children at the railway station and pier, and enthusiastically found pedicabs for passengers and arranged hotel accommodation. Some policemen also helped dock workers load and unload goods and assisted farmers in pushing manure carts. All public security personnel in the city, except those who were out on duty or had urgent tasks, participated in the Loving-the-People movement.
    After the Guangzhou public security personnel carried out the Loving-the-People Month movement around the Spring Festival of 1959, the activities of doing good deeds for the people have become a regular occurrence and have been warmly praised by the broad masses of the people. The masses call them "Good Police of Chairman Mao."
    The people often go to the public security police station to visit the police and express their gratitude to the police at the sentry box. Some people also write big-character posters or letters to praise the good style of the police. In the past year, the people's police in Guangzhou have been praised by the masses more than 9,800 times.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 26th: Chongqing public security personnel have deeply launched the Loving-the-People Month movement since mid-January, and have been doing good deeds for the masses in a big way. According to preliminary statistics from the six sub-bureaus and two directly subordinate units of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in less than ten days after the start of Loving-the-People Month, more than 29,000 good deeds were done for the masses.
    The good deeds done by the public security personnel for the masses include accumulating fertilizer, repairing bridges and roads, rescuing from disasters, helping the poor and relieving difficulties, and helping the masses find relatives and friends. The Mi Tingzi Police Station in Jiangbei District worked hard for two nights to build railings on the San Dong Bridge, which often injured pedestrians. The masses were very moved and sent more than 100 big-character posters of praise. More than 30 policemen from the Xiaolongkan Police Station and Sub-bureau in Shapingba District used their Sunday to repair two collapsed public toilets, solving the difficulties of more than 1,000 residents. Residents in the Linjiangmen Xinglongtai Street area in the central district used to have to walk a long way to get hot water, which was very inconvenient to go uphill and downhill. During the Loving-the-People Month, the police from the Dayanggou Police Station spent three days repairing a stove for the masses. The masses were very happy and named the stove "Loving-the-People Stove."

    深入开展爱民月运动
    上海公安派出所向群众汇报工作征求意见
    广州市公安人员爱民月活动遍及各个角落
    重庆市公安人员为群众积造肥料修桥补路
    新华社上海26日电　上海市各级公安机关正在深入地开展爱民月运动，已经获得了显著的成绩。
    在爱民月运动中，各公安局派出所都向群众汇报工作，征求意见。广大市民以主人翁的态度，在表扬很多长期忠心耿耿地为人民服务的好同志的同时，也对个别作风上有缺点的公安人员，提出了诚恳的批评。受到群众表扬的公安人员，都表示要更加虚心地接受群众监督，更好地维护国家和人民的利益。受到批评的个别公安人员，也诚恳地向群众表示改正决心，有的还登门向提意见的群众作自我检讨。
    上海市公安人员，在爱民月运动中，千方百计地为人民群众办好事。1月9日长沙路派出所民警秦兴发，因事到山海关路一四一号二楼，发现七十多岁的贺阿娥和两个孩子因煤气中毒，都已昏迷，其中一个四岁的女孩，已停止呼吸，满身粪便。秦兴发发现后，立即把三个人都背到楼下，雇了三轮车送到医院，经过急救，使三人都脱离了险境。蓬莱路派出所的一位女民警，每天都帮助一位有病的单身老太太买菜、泡开水、打扫房间，还陪老太太去医院看病。不少派出所还坚持上门受理户口的制度，便利居民。
    公安人员这样良好的服务态度，进一步密切了同人民群众的关系。在延安中路有一位六十多岁的赵老太太，她每次上街买菜，总是有民警搀扶着过马路，她非常感动。近来民警接到她的一封信，信上写着：“人民警察对我这样体贴关心，真使我感到社会主义生活越过越幸福。”延安中路、北京东路等地区，有些居民还以说唱和活报等形式，宣扬公安人员热爱人民的事迹。
    新华社广州26日电　广州市公安人员开展的爱民月活动，已经遍及全市各个角落。这个运动，是在1月16日开始的。
    16日凌晨二时零五分，荔湾派出所两位所长正在灯下工作，忽然一个街坊妇女飞也似地跑进来通知说：“女厕所有一个产妇生小孩了！”两个所长立即分头去想办法帮助产妇脱离险境。他们冒着大风大雨到医院要求派救急车，不巧救急车出发了；于是他们一面到保健所，去请求帮助，一面唤醒了两个民警，抬上担架去接产妇。当他们赶到现场时，婴儿已出生了二十多分钟，产妇昏迷不醒。他们先用自己的棉衣、棉被给母子俩盖好，然后立即把产妇、婴儿送到保健所，挽救了两条垂危的性命。这一天内，广州市公安人员不仅办了许多件扶危救急的好事，还到盲人工厂去帮助盲人搞清洁，到养老院去替老人打扫环境卫生，在火车站和轮船码头上帮助旅客搬运行李、照顾小孩，并且热情地为旅客找三轮车，安排旅店住宿。有些民警还帮助码头工人装卸货物，协助农民推大粪车。全市公安人员除了外出和有紧急任务的以外，都参加了爱民运动。
    广州市公安人员在1959年春节前后开展爱民月运动以后，为人民群众办好事的活动已经成为经常的事情，受到广大人民群众的热烈赞扬。群众称他们为“毛主席的好警察”。
    人民群众常到公安派出所去探望民警，到岗亭上去向民警表示谢意，有些群众还写了大字报或信件表扬民警的优良作风。一年来，广州市人民警察受到群众的表扬有九千八百多次。
    据新华社重庆26日电　重庆公安人员从1月中旬深入地开展爱民月活动，为群众大办好事。据市公安局所属六个分局和两个市直属单位初步统计，爱民月开始后不到十天的时间，就为群众办了两万九千多件好事。
    公安人员为群众办的好事中，包括积造肥料，修桥补路，抢灾救险，济困扶危，以及帮助群众寻找亲友等。江北区米亭子派出所苦战两个通宵，把一座经常跌伤行人的三洞桥修了栏杆，群众很感动，送来了一百多张表扬的大字报。沙坪坝区小龙坎派出所和分局的三十多个民警，利用星期天修补好了两座坍塌的公共厕所，解决了一千多居民的困难。市中区临江门兴隆台街一带居民，原来打开水要走很远的路，上坡下坎很不方便。爱民月中，大阳沟派出所的民警，花了三天时间为群众修好了一个老虎灶，群众很高兴，把这个灶命名为“爱民灶”。
