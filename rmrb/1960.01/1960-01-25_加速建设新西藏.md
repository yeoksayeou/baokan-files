    Accelerate the Construction of a New Tibet
    By Dawa, Tibetan worker at the Lhasa Automobile Repair Factory, National Advanced Producer
    After seeing the communique on the 1959 national economic development, I felt indescribably excited.
    We Tibetan workers wholeheartedly support the Great Leap Forward. In 1 ജനറൽ under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line of "going all out,aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results in building socialism," Tibet's production and construction have greatly developed in 1959. In the past, under the rule of the serf system, Tibet had been almost a blank slate in terms of industry and transportation for many years. Before liberation, even the knives Tibetans used to cut meat were produced elsewhere. Now, our Han and Tibetan workers have already smelted qualified steel. Before liberation, it was difficult to even see a bicycle in Tibet. Now, our Han and Tibetan workers have manufactured tractors, automobiles, and motorboats. Take our factory as an example. Last year was the year with the heaviest production tasks since our factory was put into operation. However, thanks to the concerted efforts of the broad masses of Han and Tibetan workers, we overfulfilled the annual task ahead of schedule by forty-eight days. At the beginning of this year, the staff and workers of our factory have once again gone all out and achieved a "good start." On New Year's Day alone, we completed 11.1% of the entire month's production plan. Our forging team has already started working on the tasks for June of this year.
    All of us Tibetan workers deeply understand that without the Communist Party, there would be no today for the people of Tibet. We must always follow the Communist Party. We Tibetan workers all know that only by completing the socialist construction of the motherland at an early date can the people of all our ethnic groups live a happy life forever. We guarantee that we will unite with the Han workers, and on the basis of the Great Leap Forward of last year, we will devote ourselves to this year's production and construction with even greater effort, accelerate the pace of construction of our new Tibet, and dedicate even greater and better achievements to the 39th anniversary of the Party!

    加速建设新西藏
    全国先进生产者拉萨汽车修配厂藏族工人  达娃
    看到1959年国民经济发展情况的公报，心里说不出的兴奋。
    我们西藏工人从心眼里拥护大跃进。1959年在党的“鼓足干劲、力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”总路线的光辉照耀下，西藏的生产建设有了很大发展。过去西藏在农奴制度的统治下，多少年来，工业和交通运输事业几乎是空白点。解放以前，西藏人用的割肉刀也是外地生产的，现在，我们汉藏工人已经炼出了合乎规格的钢；解放以前，在西藏连自行车都很难看到，现在，我们汉、藏、工人却制配出了拖拉机、汽车和汽船。就拿我们厂来说，去年是我们厂投入生产以来生产任务最重的一年，但是由于广大汉、藏工人的一致努力，结果提前四十八天超额完成了全年的任务。今年一开始，我们厂的职工又鼓足了干劲，实现了“开门红”，仅元旦一天，就完成了1月份全月生产计划的11．1％，我们锻工组已经开始做今年6月份的工作了。
    我们全体藏族工人都深深懂得，没有共产党，就不会有我们西藏人民的今天，我们一定要永远跟着共产党走。我们藏族工人都知道，只有早日完成祖国的社会主义建设，我们各民族人民才能过永远的幸福生活。我们保证，一定要与汉族工人团结一致，在去年大跃进的基础上，以更大的干劲投入到今年生产建设中来，加速我们新西藏的建设步伐，以更大更好的成绩向党的三十九周年献礼！
