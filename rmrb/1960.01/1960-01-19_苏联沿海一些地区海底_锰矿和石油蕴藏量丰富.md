    Soviet Academician Sherbakov recently said that manganese ore has been discovered on the seabed off the northern Pacific coast of the Soviet Union, the Barents Sea, the Kara Sea, and other coastal areas. Manganese ore on the seabed appears in the form of nodular concretions. There are approximately 45 billion tons of this type of manganese ore on the seabed of the Atlantic Ocean and over 120 billion tons on the seabed of the Indian Ocean. There are also large amounts of oil on the seabed.
