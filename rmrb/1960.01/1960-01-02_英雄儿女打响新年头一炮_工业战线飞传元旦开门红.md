The steelworkers at the No. 1 blast furnace, a national red banner furnace, adopted new measures today to increase smelting intensity, resulting in pig iron production exceeding the shift plan by more than 70 tons. The steelworkers in the electric furnace workshop, using advanced experiences such as oxygen blowing and rapid charging, and constantly maintaining equipment, increased today's shift production by about a quarter compared to the highest shift production record of last year. The steelworkers at the converter steelmaking experimental plant, a national advanced collective, began a steel production relay race this morning. The steel production of the first two shifts exceeded the plan by 14%, surpassing the shift production level of the fourth quarter of last year, with a 100% qualified rate for steel ingots.
