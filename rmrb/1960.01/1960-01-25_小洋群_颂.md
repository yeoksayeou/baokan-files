Ode to the "Small Foreign Furnaces"
Li Dongsheng

    In the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1959, the "small foreign furnaces" made outstanding contributions in the great battle of "taking steel as the key link."
    Recently, I had the opportunity to take a quick look at the steel base in the suburbs of Hefei. At night, a gleam of light reddened half of the clear sky. Such a scene is indeed very common in Anshan Iron and Steel, Chongqing Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and in Shanghai and Taiyuan. But in Hefei, in Anhui, it is extremely attractive. Turning over the data: in 1957, Hefei did not have a single blast furnace, and the province's pig iron production was only a little over 200,000 tons. In just over a year, more than 800 small blast furnaces with a volume of 8 cubic meters or more have been scattered all over the place and blossomed everywhere. The production of pig iron has soared. This is truly an earth-shaking change.
    In the iron and steel industry, a region that was originally poor and blank has been able to fundamentally change its face so quickly, which can be described as both large and fast, and both good and economical. If you ask how it was possible to do this? That is: walking on two legs. One of these legs is the "small foreign furnaces." In Anhui's total pig iron production in 1959, the small foreign blast furnaces accounted for more than 60%.
    The emergence of all new things must go through twists and turns. The "small foreign furnaces" were born in response to the compelling situation and the will of the people. But when it was first born, some people were busy arranging its "eight characters," saying that it was "congenitally deficient," suffered from "cancer," and was destined to "die young." However, the facts have proved that the "small foreign furnaces" are not sick infants, but new buds full of vitality. The "small foreign furnaces" refuted those who poured cold water with their strong vitality; they also embodied the attitude of revolutionaries towards new things with their strong vitality. It is this Marxist attitude that promoted the birth and growth of new things.
    Let us turn the time back to more than a year ago: in the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking, thousands of small indigenous blast furnaces were established north and south of the Yangtze River and on both sides of the Huai River. Indigenous methods were used to gain time and increase production, and the targets of the Great Leap Forward were overfulfilled. However, to meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical, it must be improved and developed. At this time, two types of people appeared: one type of person wanted to reach the sky in one step, talked with relish about the big ones, and yearned for them; they disdained the small ones and sneered at them. The other type of person hoped to stay where they were, were very attached to the "indigenous" ones, and held on to them; they regarded the "foreign" ones as a frightening road and dared not touch them. Obviously, the former were eager for quick success, and the latter were standing still. Neither of them could meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. We have seen the goals of big and foreign, and we oppose clinging to the old and preserving the deficiencies; we will start with the small and indigenous, so that we can move from indigenous to foreign, from small to big, more, faster, better, and more economically. Among them, the start-up of the "small foreign furnaces" greatly promoted development. Because, compared to the "indigenous" ones, the "foreign" ones are more advanced and can lay the foundation for further transformation and improvement; compared to the big ones, the small ones are more convenient and can mobilize the masses to make great efforts; thus, the contradiction between quantity and quality, and the contradiction between current tasks and long-term plans, are all readily solved. Practice has proved that on the inevitable road from small to big and from indigenous to foreign, the "small foreign furnaces" are an indispensable "midway station." "Small indigenous furnaces - small foreign furnaces - large foreign furnaces (medium foreign furnaces)" This is the law derived from practice. Grasping the central link of the "small foreign furnaces" can "build on the past and open up the future" and reach a higher level. Anhui's iron and steel industry is now generally transitioning to "medium foreign furnaces."
    The "small foreign furnaces" were drilled out, and it is certain that we must drill in the face of new things. The thought-provoking question is, why can we drill through as soon as we drill, and why can we grasp accurately as soon as we grasp? It is precisely because: first, we have adhered to the spirit of the general line; second, we have flexibly applied dialectics to practical work; and third, we have given full play to people's enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity on the premise of respecting objective laws. The "small foreign furnaces" have unlimited prospects, and they will make more contributions with the giant strides of socialist construction!

    “小洋群”颂
    李冬生
    在1958年和1959年的大跃进里，在“以钢为纲”的伟大战斗里，“小洋群”立下了汗马功劳。
    最近，有机会到合肥市郊的钢铁基地走马看花。入夜，一片闪光映红了半个晴空。这样的景色，在鞍钢、重钢、武钢，在上海、太原，的确很平常。但是在合肥、在安徽，却极其诱人。翻开资料：1957年合肥还没有一座高炉，全省的生铁产量也只有二十万吨挂零。短短一年多的时间，八百多座八立方米以上的小高炉就已星罗棋布，遍地开花。生铁的产量扶摇直上。这真是一个翻天复地的变化。
    在钢铁工业上，一个原来又穷又白的地区，能够这样快的从根本上改变了面貌，可谓既多又快，既好又省。若问何以能够做到？那就是：用两条腿走路。其中的一条腿就是“小洋群”。在安徽1959年的生铁总产量中，小洋高炉生产的就占60％以上。
    一切新生事物的出现，都要经过艰难曲折。“小洋群”是在逼人的形势下应天顺人而生的。但是当它呱呱坠地的时候，就有人忙着为它排“八字”，说它“先天不足”，患了“癌症”，命定要“夭折”。但是，事实却证明“小洋群”不是带病的婴儿，而是富有生命力的新芽。“小洋群”以它的强大的生命力，回击了那些泼冷水者；也以它的强大的生命力，体现了革命者对待新生事物的态度，正是这种马克思主义者的态度促进了新生事物的诞生和成长。
    让我们把时间拉回到一年多以前：在大炼钢铁的热潮中，大江南北、淮河两岸，建立了成千上万座的小土高炉。土法上马，争取了时间，增加了产量，大跃进的指标得以超额实现。但是，要达到多快好省的要求，必须提高，必须发展。这时，出现了两种人：一种人企求一步登天，对大的津津乐道，心向往之；对小的不屑一顾，嗤之以鼻。另一种人则希望原地踏步，对“土”的十分恋栈，抱住不放；对“洋”的则视之畏途，不敢沾边。显然，前者是急于求成，后者是停步不前，二者都无法达到多快好省的要求。我们既看到了大和洋的目标，反对抱残守缺；我们更会从小的，土的入手，这样才能多快好省地由土到洋，由小到大。其中，“小洋群”上马，大大促进了发展。因为，比之“土”的，“洋”的先进，可以为进一步改造和提高打下基础；比之大的，小的方便，可以发动群众大搞特搞；于是，数量和质量的矛盾、当前任务和长远规划的矛盾，全部迎刃而解。实践证明：在由小到大，由土到洋的必由之路上，“小洋群”是不可缺少的“中途站”。“小土群—小洋群—大洋群（中洋群）”，这是从实践中得出来的规律，抓住“小洋群”这个中心环节，就能“承前启后”，就能更上一层楼。安徽的钢铁工业，现在就已普遍在向“中洋群”过渡。
    “小洋群”是钻出来的，在新的事物面前要钻，这是肯定的。耐人寻味的问题是，为什么一钻就能钻通，一抓就能抓准？正是因为：第一，坚持了总路线的精神；第二，把辩证法灵活地运用在实际工作之中；第三，在尊重客观规律的前提下，充分地发挥了人的积极性、主动性和创造性。“小洋群”前途无限，它将要随着社会主义建设的巨步建立更多的功勋！
