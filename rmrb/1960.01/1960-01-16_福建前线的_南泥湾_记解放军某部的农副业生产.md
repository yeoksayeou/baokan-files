The "Nanniwan" on the Fujian Front
    ——A Record of Agricultural and Sideline Production by a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter: Ye Feng
    People remember that during the Anti-Japanese War, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and launched a large-scale production movement, resulting in the nationally renowned "Nanniwan." Today, the People's Liberation Army maintains and carries forward this glorious tradition, and has built many "Nanniwans" for the socialist construction of the motherland. The agricultural and sideline production base built by a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in the Fujian front in its barracks while defending the coast is one of them.

    Walking into the barracks of this unit, it is truly like arriving at a farm and livestock farm. Chickens and ducks are everywhere, cattle and sheep are seen everywhere, neat vegetable fields are connected in one piece, various fruit trees are planted all over the hills, fish are jumping happily in the ponds, and fat pigs are robust in the pigsty. Alongside the newly built roads that crisscross, there are rows of red brick and gray tiled barracks. The land cultivated by this unit is more than 4,800 mu, more than 1.4 million newly planted fruit trees, more than 4,500 pigs, more than 3,000 chickens and ducks, more than 650 cattle, as well as machinery repair factories, cement factories, lime factories, oil pressing factories, soap factories, and sauce gardens serving agricultural and sideline production. In the past ten months, the meat, vegetables, etc. they produced not only basically met their own needs, but also began to support fraternal units and the local market. Nearby troops often come to learn from their production experience, praising their achievements in rapidly changing the appearance of the stationed area. People who come to visit from other provinces affectionately call it the "Nanniwan" of that time.

    This is a strip-shaped basin, surrounded by high mountains, dense forests, and rolling hills. Before liberation, due to the remote location and inconvenient transportation, few people came here to make a living. After liberation, the Party and the government, in order to develop local production, built roads and the number of farmers began to increase, but there was still a lot of land that no one cultivated. The spring before last, this unit came and began to reclaim wasteland for planting vegetables and raising pigs. Because the tasks of war preparedness, training, and construction of barracks were heavy, the scale of production was very small. After the announcement of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the officers and soldiers were in high spirits and expressed their determination to carry forward the glorious tradition of "Nanniwan" on the production front. The Party committee of the unit, based on the requirements of the broad masses of officers and soldiers and the natural conditions of the驻地, formulated a plan to "turn the barracks into a base for the production of non-staple foods," and established a production committee to preside over this work.

    At the beginning, they lacked production experience and encountered many difficulties. When raising pigs, there was swine fever and piglets kept dying; when planting vegetables, they couldn't grasp the local farming season. The seeds didn't sprout when sown, and the seedlings didn't grow tall when they did sprout; the fruit trees they planted also had low survival rates due to a lack of horticultural knowledge. At this time, the Party committee launched the broad masses of officers and soldiers to offer suggestions and ideas; and sent people out to study and hold training classes after they returned. Leading cadres at all levels also planted "experimental fields," summarizing experiences to promote production. When company commander Qi Baoxue encountered difficulties in raising pigs in the company, he used his off-duty time to work as a feeder for a month, and together with the soldiers, he researched a set of feeding management methods. After his methods were widely promoted in the unit, the incidence of pig diseases was greatly reduced. In addition to the more than fifty pigs currently in the pen, his company produced more than 5,500 jin of pork last year, exceeding the original plan by three times. Local farmers said that the soil here was not good and chives did not grow when planted. The artillery company boldly experimented on newly reclaimed wasteland, and harvested more than 7,000 jin from one mu and three fen of land in eight months. Due to their diligent learning and careful cultivation, the bananas and pineapples they planted even blossomed and bore fruit ahead of schedule.

    When I arrived at this unit along the newly built road in the evening, the basin was full of officers and soldiers working side by side. They said that they engaged in training during the day and busy with production in the morning and evening. Here, I met many soldiers who could fight and produce. In the orchard production team, I interviewed deputy squad leader Zhan Xiyu. Before joining the army, he was a service员 in a food store. After joining the army, he studied diligently and became an "all-rounder" artilleryman. In the炮战 of August of the previous year, he fought bravely and was praised by his superiors for severely punishing the Chiang Kai-shek army in Kinmen. After returning from the front, he went to the orchard production team and actively learned from the old fruit farmers. Soon he mastered the basic knowledge of cultivating citrus. When he returned to the team to participate in military, political, and cultural studies, many soldiers kept running to him to ask for advice. Pig-raising soldier Shen Peng is a famous "pig nanny" and "pig doctor." Veterinary Director Zhou Fengqing told me that he was a good soldier in the班, and he was also in the lead when he was a cook and a giver. Since raising pigs, he has also fallen in love with pigs. When it was hot, he bathed the pigs. When it was cold, he spread straw in the pigsty. All of the sixty pigs in the连 are healthy, growing fast and fat. After arriving at the production team of the battalion headquarters, he not only raised pigs, but also served as an "epidemic prevention员", assisting the veterinarian in curing many pig diseases. Here, I also met many officers who came to participate in labor in轮番. They were as enthusiastic as the soldiers and worked happily.

    During my visit, this unit was conducting a winter production competition in order to expand production. One unit built a fish pond in ten days, raising 100,000 fish, and another unit deep-plowed all the cultivated land and sowed菜籽. A leading comrade said to me humorously: "It won't be long before our给养员 (the person in charge of purchasing non-staple foods) can only work at home."

    福建前线的“南泥湾”
    ——记解放军某部的农副业生产
    新华社记者　冶峰
    人们记得，抗日战争时期，八路军、新四军响应党中央和毛主席的号召，开展了大生产运动，出现了全国闻名的“南泥湾”。今天，人民解放军保持和发扬了这一光荣传统，为了祖国的社会主义建设又建成了许多个“南泥湾”。福建前线某部在保卫海防的同时，在营区里建成的农副业生产基地就是其中的一个。
    走进这支部队的营区，真像到了农场和畜牧场，到处是鸡鸭，处处有牛羊，整齐的菜地连成一片，各种果树栽遍山岗，池塘里鱼儿欢跃，猪圈里肥猪健壮，在纵横交错的新修的公路两旁，是一排排红砖灰瓦的营房。这支部队耕种的土地有四千八百多亩，新栽的果树一百四十多万棵，猪四千五百多头，鸡鸭三千多只，牛六百五十多头，还有为农副业生产服务的机器修理厂、水泥厂、石灰厂、榨油厂、肥皂厂和酱园。十个月来，他们生产的肉菜等不但基本上满足了自己的需要，还开始支援兄弟部队和当地市场。附近的部队经常来学习他们的生产经验，赞扬他们迅速改变驻区面貌的成就，外省来参观的人更亲?地叫它是当年的“南泥湾”。
    这里，是一块带形的盆地，周围山高林密，丘陵起伏。解放前，因地区偏僻、交通不便，很少有人进来谋生。解放后，党和政府为了发展当地生产，修通了道路，农户开始增加，仍然有不少土地没人开垦耕种。前年春天，这支部队来了，开始开荒种菜、养猪，因为战备、训练、建设营区的任务繁重，生产规模很小。党的社会主义建设总路线宣布后，官兵们意气风发，纷纷表示要在生产战线上发扬“南泥湾”的光荣传统。部队党委根据广大官兵的要求和驻地的自然条件，订出“把营区变成副食品生产基地”的规划，成立了生产委员会，主持这一工作。
    开始，他们生产经验不足，遇到许多困难。养猪，有猪瘟，小猪不断死亡；种菜，掌握不住当地的农时，下了种不出苗，出了苗长不大；栽的果树，也因为缺乏园艺知识，开始时叶长得很旺，不久被虫吃掉，成活率很低。这时候，党委一面发动广大官兵献策献计；一面派人外出学习，回来举办训练班。各级领导干部也都种了“试验田”，总结经验推动生产。连长戚宝学在连里养猪遇到困难的时候，利用下班当兵一个月的时间当饲养员，和战士们一起研究出一套饲养管理方法，他的方法在部队广泛推广以后，猪的发病率大大降低。他的连队除现在圈存的五十多头猪以外，去年生产猪肉五千五百多斤，超过原计划三倍。当地农民说，这里土质不好，韭菜种了不长，炮兵连在新开的荒地上大胆试种，一亩三分地八个月收了七千多斤。他们种的香蕉、菠萝，由于虚心学习、细心培植，有的还提前开花结果了。
    当我沿着新修的公路，傍晚到达这支部队时，盆地里到处是军官、士兵并肩劳动的景象。他们说他们是白天搞训练，早晚忙生产。在这里，我遇到许多能打仗、会生产的战士。在果林生产队，我访问了副班长詹锡玉，他在入伍以前是个食品商店的服务员。入伍以后，勤学苦练，成了“一专多能”的炮手，前年8月严惩金门蒋军的炮战中，战斗勇敢，受到上级的表扬。从前线归来后，他到果林生产队，积极地向老果农学习，不久就掌握了培植柑桔的基本知识。当他回队参加军、政、文化学习的时候，许多战士还不断跑来向他请教。养猪战士沈碰是有名的“猪保姆”、“猪医生”。兽医主任周凤卿告诉我，他在班里是个好战士，当炊事员、给养员的时候也处处领先。养猪以来，他又爱上了猪。天热了，他给猪洗澡，天冷了，他在猪舍里铺上稻草，全连六十多头猪，不生病，长得快，长得肥。到了营部生产组以后，他一面养猪，一面当“防疫员”，协助兽医治好了许多猪病。在这里，我也遇到许多轮番来参加劳动的军官，他们和战士一样劲头足，干得欢。
    在我访问期间，这支部队为了扩大生产，正在进行冬季生产竞赛。有一个单位十天修了一个鱼塘，养鱼十万条，另一个单位深翻了全部耕地，播下了菜籽。一位领导同志很有风趣地对我说：“不要多久，我们的给养员（负责采买副食品的人）就只能在家里工作了。”（附图片）
