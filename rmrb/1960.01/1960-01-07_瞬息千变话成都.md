Talking About the Rapidly Changing Chengdu
Mi Jianshu

Chengdu is an ancient city with a long history in the "Land of Abundance." Many famous writers, such as Yang Xiong, Zuo Si, Du Fu, and Lu You, praised it in their works; however, ten years ago, Chengdu was a dilapidated city. Decades of destruction and trampling by warlords, bureaucrats, landlords, and bullies had made it exceptionally decayed and desolate. Everywhere were broken streets and alleys, everywhere were faces filled with hunger and sorrow. The once magnificent imperial palaces of the "Imperial City" had become dark and filthy places; the Jin River and Yu River, which once flowed through the city with blue waves and swaying boats, had become sewage ditches less than a meter wide; the once famous Shu brocade, Shu embroidery and other handicrafts were on the verge of extinction. Modern industry was almost non-existent. From 1877 (the third year of the Guangxu reign in the Qing Dynasty), when Ding Baozhen, the Governor-General of Sichuan, established the Mechanical Bureau in Chengdu, only a few broken factories had been built in the more than seventy years leading up to liberation. The Qiming Electric Light Company, which had been in operation for thirty or forty years, had only three old machines with a total power generation capacity of no more than 2,500 kilowatts, and power outages occurred every two or three days. Its weak current was only enough to turn the tungsten filaments of the light bulbs red. This was Chengdu before liberation!

In December 1949, this city returned to the hands of the people. It was the last major city on the Chinese mainland to be liberated. From the day the People's Liberation Army entered the city, Chengdu began its new history. Under the leadership of the Party, hundreds of thousands of hardworking people of Chengdu thoroughly transformed the old city, carried out a vigorous socialist industrial construction and urban construction, and gradually, yet rapidly, changed the political, economic, and cultural landscape of Chengdu.

The opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was the first great joyous event for the people of Chengdu after liberation. The people of Chengdu had been looking forward to the construction of this railway for more than forty years. In order to build the road, they had paid countless extortionate taxes under various false pretenses to the reactionaries; in order to build the road, they had waged a vigorous struggle against the reactionaries. In 1911, the people of Chengdu launched a fiery revolutionary struggle to resist the Qing Dynasty's encroachment on road funds and the sale of railway rights to imperialism. Many revolutionary martyrs died heroically under the butcher knives of the reactionaries. The "Xinhai Autumn Railway Protection Martyrdom Memorial Monument," built to commemorate the martyrs who defended the railway, still stands majestically in the lush forests of the People's Park. This towering monument is a testament to the modern history of Chengdu. In the decades under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty and local warlords, the people of Chengdu had never seen even an inch of steel rail. But just over two years after liberation, the massive project of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was successfully completed. This was the first railway built by the Chinese people using their own rolled steel rails. On the day when the people of Chengdu celebrated the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway with jubilation, according to the great call of Chairman Mao's personal inscription "Celebrating the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, continue to work hard to build the Tianfu-Chengdu Railway," the Baoji-Chengdu Railway also broke ground. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway followed the footsteps of the People's Liberation Army into Sichuan, traversing the majestic Qinling Mountains and the Jianmen Pass, where "even the yellow cranes cannot fly over, and the apes worry about climbing," turning the "difficult to climb to the sky" Shu Road into a thoroughfare between Sichuan and Shaanxi. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, like two huge arteries, connect Chengdu with the vast areas of southwestern, northwestern, and northern China, and with the heart of our motherland – Beijing. Coupled with the three railways currently under construction – the Chengdu-Kunming, Neijiang-Kunming, and Sichuan-Guizhou Railways – a comprehensive transportation network will be formed around Chengdu.

As soon as you step into the Chengdu Industrial Exhibition Hall, you will see a microcosm of the great achievements of Chengdu's socialist industrial construction over the past decade. On display here are many new products, steel, various machinery and equipment, precision instruments, tools, electrical equipment, exquisite daily-use industrial products, etc. Some of them are things that Chengdu had never had before, and some of them used to rely entirely on foreign imports or support from other regions, but now they can all be manufactured here. Tall factory buildings, chimneys, and workers' dormitories are rising from the ground one after another. Places that were once full of graves and weeds have now become a brand-new industrial zone, with magnificent red building complexes scattered like stars, shining together. In the past decade, more than two hundred large, medium, and small factories have been newly built or expanded in the city, and the vast majority have been fully or partially put into production. The total industrial output value has increased more than forty times. A series of industrial production sectors that Chengdu had never had before, such as modern steel industry, precision machinery manufacturing industry, radio industry, chemical industry, etc., have been established or are being rapidly established. Ten years ago, the Yuhua Yarn Factory, with only five thousand spindles and six hundred workers, was the largest factory in Chengdu, but it is only about the same as the current practice factory of the Chengdu Textile School, and it is far inferior to the Sichuan No. 1 Cotton Mill, which has one hundred thousand spindles. Chengdu had never even seen a train before, but now it can produce locomotives; it had never even seen a 50-kilowatt motor before, but now it can manufacture 800-kilowatt motors; it never produced a single pound of iron or steel in the past, but in the fiery mass movement of the Great Leap Forward in Steel in 1958, it quickly established a small-scale iron and steel complex – the Chengdu Iron and Steel Plant and several steel workshops attached to machinery factories. The construction speed of the Chengdu Iron and Steel Plant, if handled according to conventional procedures, would have taken at least two or three years to put into production, but it produced iron 45 days after groundbreaking, steel 103 days later, and rolled steel 181 days later.

While developing modern industry, Chengdu's traditional handicrafts have also been rapidly restored and developed. Thousands of new varieties have been introduced, the quality has been significantly improved, and the equipment and working conditions have been greatly improved. The colorful Shu brocade, the dazzling lacquerware, the exquisite silver and bamboo silk products, etc.; these crystallized products of the labor and wisdom of outstanding folk artists have all emitted a more brilliant light in the socialist garden of a hundred flowers.

For more than two thousand years, Chengdu has not only been the economic and political center of the "Land of Abundance," but also a famous city of culture. Countless scholars have been cultivated here. In 143 BC, Wen Weng, the governor of Shu Prefecture in the Western Han Dynasty, founded the first school here. Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, famous masters of ci and fu in the Han Dynasty, were both born in Chengdu. The patriotic poets Du Fu and Lu You also lived in Chengdu for a long time, writing many poems that have been passed down through the ages. More than one-sixth of the vast chapters in Du Fu's collection of poems were born in Chengdu. Now, the new socialist culture has released infinite brilliance in Chengdu. Countless magnificent high-rise buildings of universities and scientific research institutions are rising one after another, competing with the countless tall buildings of factories. In the seventeen universities, tens of thousands of energetic young people, holding high the red banner of the Party's educational policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor," are bravely climbing the peaks of modern science and culture. The footprints of teachers and students of the Chengdu Institute of Geology have traversed the Sichuan Basin and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, exploring dozens of underground treasures such as ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, and non-metals. The teachers and students of the Chengdu Institute of Technology designed most of the bridges, roads, and well sites for the central Sichuan oil area. In recent years, the Southwest Nationalities College has trained a large number of ethnic work cadres for dozens of fraternal ethnic groups such as Tibetan, Yi, Miao, Qiang, and Hui in the southwestern region. Mass scientific research work is also blooming like spring flowers. Countless innovations and creations are promoting the continuous development of industrial and agricultural production. An ordinary slaughterhouse worker, after several years of painstaking research, successfully manufactured an "electric skinning machine"; the farmers of the Jinniu People's Commune in the suburbs created an advanced experience of growing vegetables twenty times a year, with a yield of 80,000 jin per mu. Now, this ancient cultural city is flying the red banner of socialist technological revolution and cultural revolution, striding into a new era of prosperity in modern industry and science and culture.

Chengdu is located in the uniquely blessed western Sichuan Plain in the "Land of Abundance." The clear and rippling Jin River and Pi River encircle its ancient city walls. The people of Chengdu have always loved flowers and trees, and hold grand flower fairs, exhibitions, and sales every spring, which are commonly known as flower fairs. Chengdu Flower Fair has a history of more than a thousand years. From the poems "Chengdu begonias are thousands of trees, and the prosperity is unparalleled in the world" and "Thousands of forests boast of magnificence, and a branch appreciates delicacy and tenderness," one can imagine the grand occasion of the flower market at that time. Meng Chang, the emperor of the Later Shu Dynasty, ordered people to plant hibiscus all over the city walls, so Chengdu has the beautiful name of Hibiscus City. In the past decade, nearly ten million new flowers, trees, fruit trees, and ornamental trees have been planted throughout the city, and everywhere is shaded by green trees and clusters of flowers. Leaving Tonghui Gate and heading west along the Huanhua Creek, one can see a lush and dense garden in the distance, which is the former residence of the Tang Dynasty poet Du Fu in Chengdu more than a thousand years ago, now the Du Fu Memorial Hall. The front of the hall is full of alders, and the stream winds around. Walking east through the flower path and leaning west on the water railing, ten thousand bamboos are verdant and dripping, and the red lotuses are dotted and fragrant, which is exactly the scene of the poet's famous line "The wind contains the emerald bamboo, quietly quiet, the rain covers the red lotus, slowly fragrant."

Now, Chengdu is continuing to leap forward. Here, houses are being built, there, bridges and roads are being built, here, canals are being dug and ponds are being created, there, trees are being planted and flowers are being planted, it is truly changing rapidly and the atmosphere is endless. It is conceivable that the future city of Chengdu will become an even more majestic city.

    瞬息千变话成都
    米建书
    成都是“天府之国”中的一座历史悠久的古城。许多著名文学家如扬雄、左思、杜甫、陆游都曾在他们的作品中盛词赞扬过它；然而十年前的成都却是一个破滥不堪的城市。几十年来，军阀、官僚、地主和恶霸的摧残、蹂躏，使它异常衰败、萧条。到处是破街陋巷，到处是饥容愁颜。从前宫阁崇丽的“皇城”，成了阴暗、污秽的场所；从前穿城而过的碧波长流、轻舟荡漾的金河、御河，变成了不到一米宽的污水沟；从前美名远扬的蜀锦、蜀绣等手工业，也已濒于绝境。现代工业少得几乎等于没有。从1877年（清光绪三年）四川总督丁宝桢在成都创设机械局起，一直到解放前夕七十多年间，只办了寥寥几家破工厂。经营了三四十年的启明电灯公司，只有三台总发电能力不过二千五百瓩的烂机器，三两日一停电，它那微弱的电流，只足以将电灯泡的钨丝烧红。这就是解放前的成都！
    1949年12月，这座城市回到了人民的手中。它是全国大陆上最后解放的一座大城市。从人民解放军入城那天起，成都就开始了自己的新的历史。几十万勤劳的成都人民，在党的领导下，对旧城市进行了彻底改造，开展了热火朝天的社会主义工业建设和城市建设，一步一步地，同时又是异常迅猛地改变了成都市的政治、经济和文化面貌。
    成渝铁路的通车，是成都人民解放后的第一件大喜事。成都人民盼望修筑这条铁路整整盼了四十多年。为了修路，他们向反动派缴纳过无数次巧立名目的骗人的苛捐杂税；为了修路，他们同反动派进行过轰轰烈烈的斗争。1911年成都人民为反抗前清王朝侵吞路款，出卖铁路权给帝国主义，掀起了如火如荼的革命斗争，许多革命烈士壮烈牺牲在反动派的屠刀之下。为纪念保路烈士而建立的“辛亥秋保路死事纪念碑”，至今还巍然矗立在人民公园苍翠的树林之中。这块高指云汉的纪念碑是成都近代史的一个见证。在蒋介石王朝和地方军阀统治的数十年间，成都人民始终连一寸钢轨也没有见过。但在解放后刚刚两年多，成渝铁路的浩大工程就胜利完成了。这是我国人民用自己轧制的钢轨修筑的第一条铁路。在成都人民欢喜若狂地庆祝成渝路通车的那天，根据毛主席亲笔题写的“庆贺成渝铁路通车，继续努力修筑天成路”的伟大号召，宝成铁路又破土动工了。宝成铁路沿着解放军入川的足迹，穿越“黄鹤之飞尚不得过，猨猱欲渡愁攀援”的巍峨的秦岭和剑门天险，把“难于上青天”的蜀道，变成了川陕通途。成渝铁路和宝成铁路，像两条巨大的动脉，使成都市和祖国西南、西北、华北的广大地区，和我们祖国的心脏——北京，一脉相连。加上目前正在修筑的成昆、内昆、川黔三条铁路，在成都的周围，将形成一个四通八达的交通网。
    一走进成都工业展览馆，你就会看到成都市十年来社会主义工业建设的巨大成绩的缩影。这里陈列着许多新产品、钢材、各种机器设备、精密的仪表、工具、电器设备、精美的日用工业品等等……。其中有的是过去成都从来没有过的，有的是过去完全依靠外国进口或者外地支援的，现在都能制造了。高大的厂房，烟囱，职工宿舍，一座又一座地从平地升起。原来是乱坟垒垒，满山荒草的地方，现在变成了一个崭新的工业区，气势雄伟的红色建筑群星罗棋布，连袂交辉。十年间全市新建、扩建的大、中、小型工厂有二百几十个，绝大部分都已经全部或部分投入了生产。工业总产值增加了四十多倍。成都过去从来没有过的现代化的钢铁工业、精密机器制造工业、无线电工业、化学工业等等一系列的工业生产部门已经建立或正在迅速建立起来。十年前，只有五千纱锭六百职工的裕华纱厂，便是成都最大的工厂了，但是，这只同现在的成都纺织学校的实习工厂差不多，如果同拥有十万纱锭的川棉一厂比起来就差得太远了。成都过去连火车都没有见过，而今已经能够生产机车了；过去连五十瓩的电动机也没有见过，而今已能制造出八百瓩的电动机了；过去从来不产一斤铁、一斤钢，在1958年如火如荼的全民大炼钢铁的群众运动中，迅速地建立起了一座小型的钢铁联合企业——成都钢铁厂和若干个附属于机械工厂的钢铁车间。成都钢铁厂的建设速度，如果按照常规办事，最少也需要两三年的时间才能投入生产，但它却是在破土兴工后四十五天就炼出了铁，一百零三天炼出了钢，一百八十一天轧出了钢材。
    在发展现代工业的同时，成都市历代相传的手工业也迅速得到恢复和发展。新品种数以千计，质量显著提高，设备和劳动条件大为改善。章彩绮丽的蜀锦，光泽夺目的漆器，精巧玲珑的银丝、竹丝制品，等等；这些民间优秀艺人的劳动和智慧的结晶品，在社会主义的百花园里，都发出了更为灿烂的光彩。
    两千多年来，成都不但是“天府之国”的经济政治中心，也是有名的文化之城。无数的文人学士从这里培育出来。公元前143年西汉蜀郡太守文翁就在这里创办了第一所学校。汉代著名的词赋大师司马相如和扬雄都出生在成都。爱国诗人杜甫和陆游也曾经长期寓居成都，在这里写出了不少千古传诵的诗篇。杜甫诗集浩瀚的篇章，有六分之一以上是在成都诞生的。现在，社会主义的新文化在成都放出了万丈光芒。高等学校和科学研究机关的无数壮丽的高楼大厦，一座座接踵而起，同工厂的无数的高大建筑物比美争辉。在十七所高等学校中，数万名生气勃勃的青年高举着党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的教育方针的红旗，奋勇攀登着现代科学文化的高峰。成都地质学院师生的足迹，踏遍了四川盆地，云贵高原，探明了数十种黑色金属、有色金属、非金属等地下宝藏。成都工学院的师生为川中油区设计了大部分桥梁、道路和井场。西南民族学院几年来为西南地区的藏、彝、苗、羌、回等几十个兄弟民族培养了大批的民族工作干部。群众性的科学研究工作，也如春花怒放。数不尽的革新创造，推动着工农业生产不断向前发展。一个普通的屠宰工人，经过几年的苦心钻研，制造成功了“电动剥皮机”；郊区金牛人民公社的农民创造了一年二十熟、亩产八万斤的蔬菜栽培的先进经验。现在这座文化古城，正飘扬着社会主义的技术革命和文化革命的红旗，阔步进入现代工业和科学文化繁荣昌盛的新时代。
    成都座落在“天府之国”中得天独厚的川西平原。碧波荡漾的锦江和郫江圜绕着它古老的城廓。成都人民历来酷爱花木，每年春天举办盛大的花市、展览、买卖，这就是人们常说的花会。成都花会有一千多年历史。从“成都海棠千万株，繁华盛丽天下无”，“千林夸盛丽，一枝赏纤柔”，这些诗句中，可以想见当时花市的盛况。后蜀的皇帝孟昶曾令人在城墙上遍植芙蓉，因而成都又有了芙蓉城的美称。十年来，全市新栽的各种花树、果树、风景树近千万株，随处都是绿树成荫，花团锦簇。出通惠门，溯浣花溪西上，遥见一座葱茏茂密的园林，那便是一千多年前唐代诗人杜甫流寓成都的草堂故宅，现在的杜甫纪念馆。堂前桤木葱葱，溪水萦回。东穿花径，西凭水槛，万竿修竹，青翠欲滴，红荷点点，清香冉冉，正是这位诗人的名句“风含翠篠娟娟静，雨裛红蕖冉冉香”的情景。
    现在，成都正在继续飞跃前进。这里在建房造屋，那里在修桥筑路，这里在开渠掘池，那里在植树栽花，真是瞬息千变，气象无穷。可以想见未来的成都市，将成为一个更加气势磅礴的城市。
