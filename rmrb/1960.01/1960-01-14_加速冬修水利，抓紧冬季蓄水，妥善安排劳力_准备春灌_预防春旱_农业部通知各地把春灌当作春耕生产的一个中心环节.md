Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on the 12th, requiring all regions to seize the preparation work for spring irrigation. The notice said: Since last winter, most areas have had little rainfall. According to meteorological forecasts, most areas will still have little rainfall from January to May this year, and some areas may experience drought. In order to prevent spring drought, ensure the healthy growth of overwintering crops and the timely sowing of spring-sown crops, and to start the first shot of continued leap forward in agricultural production in 1960, seizing the preparation for spring irrigation is one of the important tasks of current agricultural production.

The notice pointed out that adhering to putting politics in command and strengthening leadership is the key to doing a good job in preparing for spring irrigation. When arranging spring plowing production, all regions should regard spring irrigation work as a central link, properly arrange the labor force required for spring irrigation, and immediately seize the establishment and improvement of irrigation management organizations at all levels and the establishment of watering professional teams; at the same time, vigorously publicize the importance of spring irrigation and the benefits of early spring irrigation, overcome the paralyzing thoughts of relying on the sky for rain and blindly optimistic emotions, and timely carry out mass spring irrigation campaigns.

The notice said that at present, all regions are organizing forces to conduct a major inspection of water conservancy projects. In this inspection, attention should be paid to large and medium-sized projects, as well as small-scale water conservancy projects, especially the quality and completeness of field projects, water lifting machinery, and land leveling. Through inspection, accelerate the progress of the project and strive to ensure that most of the newly built and improved projects can achieve complete engineering, complete water lifting machinery, and complete management organizations before spring plowing production water is used, so as to give full play to the role of the project in spring irrigation. For water storage projects, attention should be paid to seizing the winter water storage work to prepare sufficient water for spring irrigation.

The notice requires all regions to prepare spring irrigation plans, but also to seize the period before spring irrigation, use various methods to strengthen the training of irrigation management cadres, irrigators, and drainage and irrigation machine drivers.

The notice said that all regions should pay attention to summarizing and promoting advanced experiences in spring irrigation preparation and spring irrigation, such as early spring irrigation, connecting winter irrigation with spring irrigation, vigorously carrying out mass spring irrigation campaigns, as well as grasping ideology, grasping plans, grasping progress, grasping inspection, and grasping the critical growing stages of crops. All aspects of experience and working methods should be vigorously promoted to promote this work. (Attached picture)

    加速冬修水利，抓紧冬季蓄水，妥善安排劳力
    准备春灌　预防春旱
    农业部通知各地把春灌当作春耕生产的一个中心环节
    新华社13日讯　农业部12日发出通知，要求各地抓紧春灌准备工作。通知说：去冬以来，大部地区少雨。从气象预报看，今年1月至5月份，大部地区仍然少雨，部分地区可能出现干旱现象。为了预防春旱，保证越冬作物茁壮生长和春播作物适时播种，打响1960年农业生产继续跃进的第一炮，抓紧准备春灌是当前农业生产的重要任务之一。
    通知指出，坚持政治挂帅，加强领导，是作好春灌准备工作的关键。各地在安排春耕生产时，应把春灌工作当作一个中心环节，要妥善安排春灌所需的劳力，现在就要抓紧建立与健全各级灌溉管理组织和建立浇地专业队；同时要大力宣传春灌的重要性与提早春灌的好处，克服某些靠天等雨的麻痹思想和盲目乐观的情绪，及时开展群众性的春灌运动。
    通知说，目前各地正在组织力量对水利工程进行大检查，在这次检查中既要注意大、中型工程，同时也要对小型水利工程，特别是田间工程、提水机具、土地平整等工作的质量与配套程度，进行全面普遍的检查，通过检查，加速工程进度，力争绝大部分新修和改善工程都能在春耕生产用水前做到工程成套、提水机具成套、管理组织成套，以充分发挥工程在春灌中的作用。对蓄水工程应注意抓紧冬季蓄水工作，为春灌准备好充足水量。
    通知要求各地要编制春灌计划，还要抓紧春灌前一段时间，利用各种方法，加强灌溉管理干部、灌水员和排灌机械司机手的培训工作。
    通知说，各地要在春灌准备和春灌中注意总结推广先进经验，如提早春灌、使冬灌接连春灌、大搞春灌群众运动，以及抓思想，抓计划，抓进度，抓检查，抓作物各个生长阶段猛攻生长关等方面的经验和工作方法，都应大力推广，以推动这一工作。（附图片）
