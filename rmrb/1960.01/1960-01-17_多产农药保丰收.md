To produce more pesticides and provide sufficient medicines for preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests for agricultural production is a major task of industry supporting agriculture.

The variety of chemical pesticides produced in China has increased from eight in the early days of liberation to more than forty. Now China can not only produce highly effective organophosphorus preparations such as 1605, Malathion, and Trichlorfon, but also various special fungicides for preventing and controlling diseases, such as Ceresan, Zineb, and Shinete. At the same time, it also produces fumigants to protect grain and agricultural products from insect damage, such as chloropicrin, methyl bromide, and rodenticides, herbicides, plant stimulants, etc. The output has also increased rapidly. The continuous growth of pesticide production has played an important role in the development of agriculture in China. However, China is a vast country with 1.6 billion mu of cultivated land and 2.4 billion mu of sown area. The varieties of crops are relatively complex, and the pesticides required are not only large in quantity but also diverse in variety. At present, the output and variety of pesticides are far from meeting the actual needs. Therefore, measures must be taken quickly to continuously increase output and variety, and to produce more pesticides for preventing crop diseases and highly effective pesticides.

The variety of chemical pesticides is large, and the variety and quantity of raw materials required are large. The current increase in the production of chemical pesticides is first and foremost faced with the incomplete supply of raw materials. Therefore, we must do everything possible to overcome difficulties, mobilize the masses to carry out technical revolution and technical innovation, resolutely implement the "four uses" policy of "economical use, comprehensive utilization, finding substitutes, and recycling utilization," improve yields, reduce consumption, save raw materials, and increase pesticide production.

Implement the "four uses policy." First of all, we should save use and reduce the quota for raw material consumption. At present, the potential for raw material consumption quotas in various factories is very large. Some factories have basically the same production methods, but the quotas are different. Taking benzene used in the production of 666 as an example, the lowest consumption at Shenyang Chemical Plant is 274 kg. If all 666 production plants across the country can reach this target, then 1,500 tons of benzene can be saved annually, and 5,000 tons of 666 can be produced. Other chemical pesticides that consume more raw materials also have great potential for reducing quotas.

Comprehensive utilization is a particularly noteworthy issue in chemical pesticide production. There are many by-products in the production of chemical pesticides. If the by-products are recycled and utilized, more pesticides can be produced. For example, for 666 pesticide itself, the generally effective insecticidal ingredient accounts for only about 14%, while the non-toxic (ineffective) part accounts for more than 85%. If these non-insecticidal ingredients are separated and chemically treated, they can also be used to manufacture hexachlorobenzene, pentachloronitrobenzene, pentachlorophenol, tetrachlorobenzene, tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone, chloropicrin, 245T and other pesticides. At the same time, purified 666 can reduce the amount of emulsifier and filler (auxiliary materials) used during processing, and can also save transportation capacity. If all the 666 produced this year is purified, about 70,000 tons of non-toxic isomers can be obtained, which can be made into about 50,000 tons of hexachlorobenzene or other pesticides. The production of DDT and other pesticides also has many by-products that can be utilized. If all of them can be utilized, more pesticides will be produced.

Increasing the yield of pesticides (that is, using the same amount of raw materials to produce more finished products), increasing the effective ingredients in the products (improving efficacy), and producing more high-efficiency pesticides are actually equivalent to increasing pesticide production. If the yield of the organophosphorus preparation 1605 is increased from 20% to 40%, it is equivalent to doubling the output without increasing raw materials. The potential in this regard is very large and should be further explored.

To increase the production of chemical pesticides, especially to increase the production of high-efficiency pesticides that are safe for humans and animals, the efficacy of various pesticides varies. For example, the efficacy of 1605 is generally ten to dozens of times that of 666. Using one jin of 1605 is equivalent to using ten to dozens of jin of 666. Therefore, producing more high-efficiency pesticides is equivalent to producing more general pesticides.

The prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests is seasonal, and it is very important to greatly increase the production of seasonal pesticides. Spring, summer and autumn are the seasons when plant diseases and insect pests are rampant. At present, we must vigorously increase production and reserve sufficient pesticides for use in the spring.

    多产农药保丰收
    多产农药，给农业生产提供足够的防治病虫害的药品，这是工业支援农业的一项重大任务。
    我国生产的化学农药已由解放初期的八种增加到四十多种。现在我国不仅能生产1605、马拉松、敌百虫等高效能的有机磷制剂，而且还生产了各种特效防治病害的杀菌剂：如赛力散、代森锌、什乃特等，同时还生产了保藏粮食农产品不受虫蚀的熏蒸剂，如氯化苦、溴甲烷和杀鼠剂、除草剂、植物刺激素等等；在产量上也有了迅速提高。农药生产的不断增长，对于我国农业的发展曾起到重要作用，但是我国是一个幅员广阔的国家，耕地面积为十六亿亩，播种面积达二十四亿亩，农作物品种比较复杂，所需农药不仅数量要大、品种也要多。目前农药的产量和品种还远不能满足实际需要，因此，必须迅速采取措施，不断提高产量，增加品种，多生产防治作物病害和高效农药。
    化学农药的品种多，所需原料品种多和数量大。当前增产化学农药首先遇到的是原料供应不全，因此必须千方百计，克服万难，发动群众大闹技术革命和技术革新，坚决贯彻“节约使用、综合利用、寻找代用、回收利用”的“四用”方针，提高收率、降低消耗、节约原料、增产农药。
    贯彻“四用方针”。首先，应节约使用，降低原料消耗定额。目前各厂的原料消耗定额潜力很大，有些厂生产方法基本相同，但定额却有不同，以生产666耗用的苯为例，沈阳化工厂最低是二百七十四公斤，如果全国各666生产厂都能达到这个指标，则每年即可节约苯一千五百吨，还可增产666五千吨，其他消耗原料较多的化学农药，降低定额的潜力也很大。
    综合利用是化学农药生产中特别值得注意的问题。化学农药生产中的副产物很多，如果把副产品回收利用，即可增产更多的农药。如666农药本身，一般有效杀虫成分只有14％左右，无毒（无效）部分却占85％以上，如果把这些不能杀虫的成分分离出来，加以化学处理，还可以制造六氯苯、五氯硝基苯、五氯酚、四氯苯、四氯对醌、氯化苦，245T等多种农药。同时提纯后的666，加工时可以减少乳化剂和填料（辅助材料）的用量，还可以节省运输力。如果今年生产的666全部提纯后，可得无毒体约七万吨，可以制成六氯苯或其他农药约五万吨。生产滴滴涕和其他农药同样也有很多可以利用的副产物。如果都能加以利用，将增产更多农药。
    提高农药的收率（就是利用同样多的原料，生产出更多的成品）、增加产品中有效成分（提高药效）和多生产高效农药，实际上就等于增产农药。如果把有机磷制剂1605的收率由20％提高到40％，就等于不增加原料而产量就可增加一倍。这方面的潜力很大，应进一步挖掘。
    要增产化学农药，特别要增产高效能而对人畜安全的农药，各种农药的药效高低不等，如1605药效在一般情况下等于666的十几倍到几十倍，使用一斤1605就等于使用十几斤到几十斤666，因此多生产高效农药就等于增产更多的一般农药。
    防治病虫害是有季节性的，大力增产季节性农药十分重要。春夏秋三季是病虫害猖狂的季节，目前必须大力增产，储备足够的农药，以备春季使用。
