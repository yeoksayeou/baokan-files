Eisenhower's Budget Message to the US Congress on January 18 (Summary)

    In presenting the budget message for the US fiscal year 1961, I urge Congress to join me in a determined effort to achieve a substantial surplus. This would make it possible to reduce the national debt. The recommendations in this budget demonstrate that this goal can be achieved while maintaining the necessary military strength and improving national welfare.

    The main points of this budget's recommendations are as follows:

    1.  Revenue of $84 billion and expenditures of $79.8 billion, resulting in a surplus of $4.2 billion. This surplus should be used to reduce the debt, which I believe is a fundamental factor in our country's current sound fiscal policy.

    2.  Provide new appropriations of $40.6 billion for the military missions of the Department of Defense, with expenditures of $41 billion. These expenditures, slightly higher than the 1960 figures, will provide the strong and diversified defense we need in the current world situation.

    3.  Increase the appropriation for the non-military space program led by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (largely restoring the amount cut by Congress in the 1960 budget), nearly doubling expenditures. This promotes our programs such as vigorously and systematically executing our intensive scientific exploration plans and developing the massive boosters necessary to conquer outer space.

    4.  Provide nearly $4.2 billion in new appropriations for the Mutual Security Program, an increase of approximately $950 million in appropriations and $100 million in expenditures compared to this year. This increase is needed to accelerate economic and technical assistance (mainly through the Development Loan Fund) and to strengthen the forces of the free world, particularly the forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with advanced weapons and equipment.

    5.  Total expenditures for water resources projects by the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation will be $1.2 billion, an unprecedented figure.

    6.  Fees in categories that are difficult to control under current laws have increased significantly, especially $9.6 billion for interest, $3.9 billion to help maintain agricultural product prices and incomes, $3.8 billion for veterans' pensions and retirement benefits, and $2.4 billion for subsidies to state and local governments for relief and unemployment insurance. These difficult-to-control expenditures represent an increase of more than $1 billion over 1960.

    7.  Research and development expenditures will be $8.4 billion—more than half of the nation's public and private expenditures in this area—to ensure continued strong and modern defense and to encourage basic research and technological progress.

    8.  Recommend swift legislative action to increase taxes on highway and aviation fuels and to raise postal rates.

    9.  Recommend that current corporate income tax and excise tax rates be maintained for another year.

    10. Implement a constructive legislative program to improve existing laws regarding government operations and to take necessary actions to improve and safeguard the interests of our people.

    Total Budget
    For fiscal year 1961, I recommend a budget surplus of $4.2 billion to reduce debt. In my judgment, this is the only sound path. Unless a certain amount of funds can be allocated to reduce debt during times of prosperity, we can anticipate a continuous increase in the national debt if future emergencies or economic recessions create deficits.

    Budget expenditures for 1961 are estimated at $79.8 billion, a figure $1.4 billion higher than the level for 1960.

      Budget Revenue
    The estimated budget revenue for fiscal year 1961 is $84 billion. This estimate assumes a high and continuously improving level of economic activity in calendar year 1960. Specifically, this revenue estimate is consistent with an increase in the gross national product from approximately $480 billion in calendar year 1959 to approximately $510 billion in calendar year 1960. Personal income and corporate profits are expected to significantly exceed last year's levels, which were somewhat affected by the prolonged steel strike.

    Review of Major Tasks
    The following sections of this budget intend to discuss the legislative and budgetary proposals for fiscal year 1961 from the perspective of the major goals to be accomplished. The table below compares the estimated expenditures for each of the nine major tasks with the actual figures for fiscal year 1959 and the latest estimated figures for fiscal year 1960.

    Major National Security
    Our national goal remains the same as before—to achieve a just peace for all peoples. We hope that the burden of armaments weighing on the world can be lightened.

    But we should not deceive ourselves. In this age of nuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles, disarmament must be guaranteed and verifiable. The issues involved in achieving disarmament while providing security and justice for all countries at the same time are numerous. But we must boldly face these issues, because failure to do so can only place the entire world on the brink of disaster.

    We must remain strong as we seek the true path toward peace and disarmament. Our current goal is to maintain a level of military strength, along with the military strength of our allies, that will be sufficient to deter wars, both large and small, while we strive to ease the threat of war. I believe this budget can achieve this.

    Expenditures by the Department of Defense in 1961 will continue to focus on modernizing our armed forces. Military assistance to our allies under the Mutual Security Program will also reflect the growing importance of modern weapons and missiles in continuing to strengthen the defense forces of the free world. The Atomic Energy Commission is currently continuing its weapons program at a high level and will continue to research and develop the peaceful uses of atomic energy. Expenditures for stockpiling and expanding defense production will be further reduced because most of the stockpiling goals have already been achieved.

    Department of Defense—
    Military Aspects: It is recommended that new appropriations of $40,577,000,000 be granted to the Department of Defense for military missions for fiscal year 1961. Expenditures for fiscal year 1961 are estimated at $40,995,000,000. These expenditures do not include funds for the development of the "Saturn" space program, which I have recommended be taken over by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

    The strategy and tactics of the US military forces are undergoing one of the greatest changes in history: in shifting the focus from conventional warfare to missile warfare, it is necessary to be careful and remember that one cannot value one form of warfare to the extent of safely ignoring another. Our military forces must be able to successfully cope with any contingency that may be imposed upon us, from limited emergencies to full-scale nuclear war.

    Number of Troops and Military Personnel—
    This budget will allow our military forces to continue at approximately their current level in fiscal year 1961—with 2,489,000 men and women on active duty at the end of the year. This armed force to be maintained includes: the Army with fourteen divisions and 870,000 personnel; the Navy with 817 active ships and 619,000 personnel; the Marine Corps with three divisions and three air wings, and 175,000 personnel; and the Air Force with ninety-one operational wings and 825,000 personnel.

    Congress suspended last year the minimum number of personnel previously imposed on the Army Reserve. The similar restriction on the strength of the Army National Guard contained in the 1960 Department of Defense Appropriations Act should also be lifted. I strongly recommend that Congress eliminate the mandatory minimum limits on the number of reserve forces to allow us to make adjustments flexibly to meet military needs.

    I recommend again that, by the end of fiscal year 1961, the Army National Guard be reduced from its current level of 400,000 to 300,000, and the Army Reserve be reduced from its current level of 300,000 to 270,000.

    Procurement, Research, and Construction—
    Nearly 45% of the Department of Defense's expenditures are spent on procurement, weapons development, and construction projects. These expenditures are estimated at $18.9 billion for fiscal year 1961.

    The new contracting authority recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement for fiscal year 1961 (excluding figures related to research and construction) totals $4,753,000,000, a decrease of $1,390,000,000 from the approved figure for fiscal year 1960. On the other hand, the new contracting authority recommended for missile procurement (excluding research and construction) for fiscal year 1961 is $3,825,000,000, an increase of $581,000,000 from fiscal year 1960. This contrasting trend in procurement reflects the changes expected to occur in the composition and missions of our armed forces in the coming years.

    The task of defining a reasonable level of military strength without endangering other important aspects of our security is greatly complicated by rapid scientific advancements. The past few years have seen perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history. Some weapon systems become obsolete while still in production, and others become obsolete while still in development.

    Furthermore, the unexpectedly rapid development of a particular weapon system or a new discovery in technology often reduces the relative importance of other competing systems. This makes it necessary to continuously study and reassess defense plans in order to reallocate resources to newer and more important weapon systems, and to halt or reduce efforts on those that have become obsolete. Therefore, in the past few years, some plans that appeared promising at the start of development have been completely cancelled. For example, the importance of the promising ship-to-land aerodynamic missile "Regulus II," designed for launch from surface submarines, has been greatly reduced due to the successful acceleration of the more advanced "Polaris" ballistic missile launched from underwater submarines.

    Another example is the recent cancellation of the F-108 aircraft, a long-range interceptor with a speed of three times the speed of sound, designed to counter manned bombers in the mid-1960s. The enormous progress made in ballistic missile technology is rapidly shifting the primary threat from manned bombers to missiles. Considering the high cost of the F-108 aircraft—the planned forces required more than $4 billion—and the period in which this aircraft would be available, the decision was made to halt further work on this project.

    The size and scale of other important projects have been reduced compared to earlier plans. Noteworthy in this regard are the "Jupiter" and "Thor" medium-range ballistic missiles. These missiles have been successfully developed, produced, and deployed, but their relative importance has decreased due to the increasing availability of "Atlas" ballistic missiles.

    Strategic Forces—
    The deterrent power of our armed forces comes from their nuclear retaliatory capability and their ability to conduct other necessary activities in any form of warfare. Representing the first capability is the combined force of manned bombers, carrier-based aircraft, and intercontinental and medium-range missiles. Representing the second capability are our land, sea, and air forces distributed in important forward areas, and the ready reserve forces that can rapidly reinforce them in emergencies.

    The Strategic Air Command is the main element of our long-range nuclear capability. One of the important and difficult decisions that must be made in this budget involves the role of the B-70—a long-range supersonic bomber. This aircraft was originally planned for preliminary practical combat use around 1965. This aircraft would be a supplement to the four strategic ballistic missile systems scheduled for earlier availability, and would also compete with these systems. The first "Atlas" intercontinental ballistic missiles are now available for practical use, the first two "Polaris" submarines are expected to be available within this calendar year, the first "Titan" intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used next year, and according to plan, the "Minuteman" solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missile is planned to be available for practical use around mid-1962. By 1965, some or all of these systems will have been fully tested, and their reliability will be fully affirmed.

    Therefore, it is questionable whether the B-70 is needed as a strategic weapon system. However, I recommend that development work on the B-70's airframe and engine continue. It is expected that two prototype aircraft will be available for test flights in 1963. By then, we should be in a much more advantageous position to determine the value of this aircraft as a weapon system.

    I recommend purchasing more improved B-52s (B-52s with new turbofan engines), and procuring B-58 supersonic medium bombers, as well as supporting tanker aircraft. These added new bombers will replace the older B-47 medium bombers; one B-52 can accomplish the work of several B-47s it replaces. This budget also includes funding for continuing to equip B-52 wings with "Hound Dog" air-to-surface missiles.

    In the next fiscal year, more "Atlas" missiles, "Titan" missiles, and "Polaris" missiles will also be procured. I recommend providing some funds to begin production of three more "Polaris" submarines in the next fiscal year, and to pre-procure components with long ordering and delivery times for another three—so that there can be a total of fifteen "Polaris" submarines and a considerable number of missiles. This budget also includes funding for continuing to develop and begin production of the first "Minuteman" missiles that can be practically used.

    Therefore, four strategic ballistic missile systems will be developed and produced in the next fiscal year. These missile systems, along with manned bomber forces, carrier-based aircraft, medium-range ballistic missiles, and tactical aircraft deployed abroad, can ensure that we have a continuous ability to conduct effective retaliation in the event that we ourselves or our allies are attacked.

    In order to ensure the safety and preparedness of these forces to the extent practicable, we have largely completed the work of dispersing Strategic Air Command aircraft and building alarm equipment. These measures can enable a large proportion of our entire manned bomber and supporting tanker fleet to take off within fifteen minutes of receiving an attack warning.

    Air Defense Forces—
    To cope with the increasing missile threat, we urgently require a new system for detecting ballistic missile attacks—the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System. Its construction has been underway for the past two years, and the first part is expected to begin operation in about a year.

    To build an active defense force against ballistic missile attacks, I recommend continuing to develop the "Nike-Zeus" system, but it will not begin production in the next fiscal year because testing will continue during this period.

    Sea Control Forces—
    Controlling the oceans and offshore regions and sea lanes of communication is an integral factor in maintaining our national security. The naval forces that bear the primary responsibility in this regard will consist of 817 combat and support ships, sixteen attack aircraft carrier air wings, eleven anti-submarine warfare air wings, and forty-one patrol and alert air squadrons.

    In fiscal year 1961, the Navy will receive an unusually large number of modern ships from the new construction and conversion programs that began in the past few years. This will include the fifth and sixth "Forrestal-class" attack aircraft carriers, the first nuclear-powered cruiser, nine guided-missile destroyers, seven guided-missile frigates, and six nuclear-powered submarines. Three more "Polaris" ballistic missile submarines and converted guided missile cruisers will also join active service.

    I recommend constructing twenty new ships and converting or modernizing another fifteen ships in the next fiscal year. The new ships will include an attack aircraft carrier. It is currently planned that this aircraft carrier will be equipped with conventional rather than nuclear engines...

    Military Assistance—
    The total military strength of countries receiving assistance under the Military Assistance Program includes: approximately 5 million army troops, 2,200 warships, and more than 25,000 aircraft, of which approximately half are jet aircraft. These forces make an extremely significant contribution to the security of the free world, including the United States.

    In fiscal year 1961, the budget for the Military Assistance Program is listed together with the other activities and programs of the Department of Defense. Major changes are being made in the management, organization, and planning of military assistance.

    The recommended new contracting authority of $2 billion for the Military Assistance Program for fiscal year 1961 will provide the amount of training and materials needed to support the armed forces of recipient countries.

    In this era of modern weapons, the cost of defending Western Europe is very high, and can only be accomplished through the joint efforts of all countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Among these countries, many have now assumed the financial responsibility for producing or purchasing conventional weapons and equipment previously supplied by the United States. At the same time, the 1961 Military Assistance Program faces the urgent need for expensive new weapons, for which the free world still relies on assistance from the United States. In addition, this program stipulates strengthened training efforts to ensure that allied forces effectively use and maintain this new equipment.

    This budget also stipulates providing military assistance to countries around the world that are building defenses against aggression and subversion. Many of these countries have joined collective defense organizations such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization, or have signed bilateral defense agreements with the United States. Most of these countries are in the Near East and Far East, and assistance to them primarily focuses on strengthening conventional forces based on the nature of threats in each region.

    Atomic Energy Activities—
    Funding for the Atomic Energy Commission for fiscal year 1961 is expected to remain at the level of approximately $2.7 billion for fiscal year 1960. A large increase in research and development activities.

    The development and production of nuclear weapons for fiscal year 1961 will remain at the high level of previous years. Vigorous development of military reactors for various propulsion and power generation purposes will continue. When the land-based prototype reactor for a destroyer goes into operation in fiscal year 1961, along with the other four naval prototype reactors already in use, nuclear engines will be able to be used for various major types of naval warships. The focus of naval reactor development in fiscal year 1961 will primarily be on developing improved and more durable reactor fuel. Work on developing nuclear ramjet engines and nuclear aircraft engines, as well as nuclear power plants for remote military bases, will continue.

    Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy—
    Expenditures for developing civilian electricity using atomic energy are estimated at $250 million for fiscal year 1961. Of this, $185 million is for research and development, and $65 million is for establishing civilian power generation reactors and related development facilities.

    The Committee's expenditures for research in natural sciences and sciences related to life will again increase significantly to over $210 million in fiscal year 1961.

    In supporting civilian space programs, the Atomic Energy Commission will continue to develop nuclear rockets and small, durable nuclear power sources for use in space vehicles. Development work on thermonuclear power and the application of nuclear explosives to various civilian undertakings will continue in fiscal year 1961.

    Stockpiling and Expanding Defense Production—
    Most of the goals for stockpiling strategic and essential materials have been completed. Materials are currently still being obtained under contract to expand defense production, but the rate of obtaining materials has slowed because the number of such contracts currently in effect is decreasing. Therefore, estimated expenditures for stockpiling and expanding defense production will decrease from $230 million in fiscal year 1960 to $134 million in fiscal year 1961.

    International Affairs and Finance
    The United States is continuing to support various programs that maintain world peace and improve the economic conditions of the entire free world. Multilateral programs are expanding in helping to improve economic conditions. At the same time, due to the urgent need for economic development, there is a demand to continue providing large amounts of economic assistance under the Mutual Security Program.

    Estimated expenditures for international affairs and finance will be $2.2 billion in fiscal year 1961. This figure is an increase of $177 million over the estimated expenditures for fiscal year 1960, mainly because the amount spent by the Development Loan Fund based on previously assumed obligations has increased.

    Mutual Security Program—
    Through the entire Mutual Security Program, the United States will help promote the stability and economic development of underdeveloped countries, and will help strengthen the defenses of the free world. Therefore, it is recommended that the new contracting authority for fiscal year 1961 be $4,175,000,000, an increase of $949,000,000 over the amount approved for fiscal year 1960 (of which $700 million is for military assistance). Estimated expenditures are $3,450,000,000, an increase of $100 million over fiscal year 1960.

    Development Loan Fund—
    The Development Loan Fund was established in 1957 with the purpose of providing funds to underdeveloped countries when they cannot obtain funds from other sources. This funding is provided on favorable terms, often including a provision that it can be repaid in the borrower's local currency. By the end of fiscal year 1960, the Development Loan Fund will have already assumed approximately 148 loan obligations totaling approximately $1.4 billion. In fiscal year 1961, estimated expenditures are $300 million, an increase of $125 million over fiscal year 1960. It is requested that new contracting authority of $700 million be provided for fiscal year 1961, an increase of $150 million over the amount approved for fiscal year 1960. This will provide funding for loans that are essential to our foreign policy objectives of helping the underdeveloped countries of the free world develop their economies.

    Defense Support—
    Many underdeveloped countries participating in collective defense maintain large military forces, and the expenditures for these forces place a great strain on their limited economic resources. In order to help maintain political and economic stability and prevent economic development from being unduly hindered by the expenditures for necessary defense forces, the United States provides economic assistance, mainly by supplying consumer goods and raw materials and machinery used for industrial production. In fiscal year 1961, new contracting authority of $724 million is needed, an increase of $29 million over the amount approved for fiscal year 1960.

    Special Assistance—
    New contracting authority of $268 million is needed to provide economic assistance to promote the economic and political stability of free world countries that do not maintain their military forces, and for certain other special programs. In some cases, this assistance is indirectly related to military bases maintained by the United States.

    The proposed appropriation for special assistance for fiscal year 1961 is an increase of $23 million over the amount approved for fiscal year 1960. Additional programs are also recommended to help improve the situation in Africa.

    Handling Foreign Affairs—
    The State Department is currently developing plans to further strengthen the handling of foreign affairs in fiscal year 1961. Language training programs will be expanded. New diplomatic and consular posts will be established in Africa, Latin America, South Asia, and Eastern Europe. To conduct activities such as these, it is requested that new contracting authority of $205 million be provided for fiscal year 1961.

    Regarding Foreign News and Exchange Activities—It is requested that a total of $168 million in new contracting authority be provided for foreign news and exchange activities for fiscal year 1961. The United States Information Agency intends to expand its programs in Africa and Latin America, including building a new "Voice of America" transmitting station in Africa. The United States Information Agency will make greater use of the growing number of overseas television facilities. The number of mutual visits between important figures from approximately eighty other countries will be increased, with particular emphasis on visits by leaders and teachers.

### 艾森豪威尔1月18日向美国国会提出的预算咨文（摘要）

1960-01-21

专栏：

    艾森豪威尔1月18日向美国国会提出的预算咨文（摘要）
    在提出美国1961财政年度预算咨文的时候，我请求国会同我一起作出坚定的努力，来取得巨额的盈余。这样就有可能减少国债。本预算中的各项建议表明能够达到这个目标，而同时保持必要的军事实力，并增进国民福利。
    本预算的建议要点如下：
    一、收入八百四十亿美元，支出七百九十八亿元，有四十二亿美元的盈余。这笔盈余应当用来减少债务，我认为减少债务是我国目前健全的财政政策中的一个基本因素。
    二、为国防部的军事任务提供新拨款四百零六亿美元，开支四百一十亿美元。这些开支比1960年的数字稍高，将提供在目前世界局势下我们所需要的强有力的、多样化的防御。
    三、增加全国星际和空间航行局主持的非军事空间计划的拨款（包括在很大程度上恢复了国会在1960年预算中削减的数目），几乎把开支增加一倍。这促进了我们这样的计划：大力地、有系统地执行我们的紧张的科学探索计划，并发展为征服外层空间所必需的巨大的推进器。
    四、为共同安全计划提供将近四十二亿美元的新拨款，比本年度的拨款增加大约九亿五千万美元，开支增加一亿美元。计划其所以需要有这样的增加，是为了加速经济和技术援助（主要通过开发贷款基金会），并以先进的武器和装备加强自由世界的部队，特别是加强北大西洋公约组织的部队。
    五、工兵团和开垦局的水利资源计划的开支总额为十二亿美元，这个数字是空前的。
    六、根据目前的法律不大能控制的类别的费用大大增加，特别是以九十六亿美元作为利息，三十九亿美元用来帮助维持农产品价格和收入，三十八亿用作退伍军人抚恤金和退休金，二十四亿美元用于补助州和地方政府进行救济和就业保险工作。这些不大能控制的开支增加总额比1960年多十亿美元以上。
    七、研究和发展费用为八十四亿美元——占全国用于这方面的公家和私人的开支的一大半——以便保证继续维持强有力的、现代化的防务，并鼓励基本研究工作和技术的进步。
    八、建议迅速采取法律行动来增加公路和航空燃料的税收并提高邮费。
    九、建议把目前的公司所得税和消费税税率再维持一年。
    十、实行一项建设性的立法计划，来改进现有关于政府工作的法律，并着手采取必要行动来改进和保障我国人民的利益。
    预算总数
    1961财政年度，我建议有四十二亿美元的预算盈余，用以减少债务。据我判断，这是唯一健全的途径。除非能在繁荣时期拨出一定数目的款项来减轻债务，否则，如果将来出现紧急状态或经济衰退而造成赤字的话，我们可以预料国债将不断增加。
    1961年度的预算支出估计为七百九十八亿美元，这个数字比1960年度的水平高出十四亿美元。
      预算收入
    1961财政年度预算收入概算为八百四十亿美元，这个概算假定在1960日历年经济活动水平很高，并且不断提高。具体来说，这项收入概算是符合国民生产总值从1959日历年的大约四千八百亿美元增加到1960日历年的大约五千一百亿美元这一情况的，个人收入和公司利润预料可以大大超过去年的水平。去年的水平由于长时间的钢铁罢工而受到一些影响。
    对主要任务的检查
    本预算的下面几节打算从有待完成的主要目标的角度谈谈1961财政年度的立法和预算建议。下表把九项主要任务的每一项的开支概算同1959财政年度的实际数字和1960财政年度的最新估计数字加以比较。

    主要的国家安全
    我们的国家目标仍然跟以前一样——使各国人民得到正义的和平。我们希望压在世界身上的军备重担能够减轻。
    但是我们不应该自己欺骗自己。在这个核武器和洲际导弹时代里，裁军必须是有保证的并且是可以查核的。实现裁军而又要给各国带来安全和正义，在这样的时候所涉及的问题是很多的。但是我们必须大胆地正视这些问题，因为如果不是这样，只能使全世界处于灾难的边缘。
    我们在寻求走向和平和裁军的真正的道路时必须保持强大。我们目前的目标是，在我们努力设法缓和战争威胁的同时要保持一定水平的军事力量，这种军事力量加上我们盟国的军事力量将足以遏止大小战争。我认为，本预算可以做到这一点。
    1961年的国防部开支将继续注意我们武装部队的现代化。根据共同安全计划给予我们盟国的军事援助，也将反映现代武器和导弹在继续加强自由世界防御部队方面的日益增长的重要性。原子能委员会目前正在很高的水平上继续执行它的武器计划，并将继续研究和发展原子能的和平用途。用于储存和扩大防御生产的开支将进一步减少，因为储存的目标大部分已经达到。
    国防部——
    军事方面：建议给予1961财政年度的国防部军事任务的新拨款为四百零五亿七千七百万美元。1961财政年度的开支估计为四百零九亿九千五百万美元。这些开支中不包括用于发展“土星”空间计划的款项，我已经建议把这项发展工作交由全国星际和空间航行局负责。
    美国军事力量的战略和战术正在经历着历史上最大的变化之一：在把重点从常规战争改变到导弹战争时必须小心，必须记住不能重视一种形式的战争而可以万无一失地忽视另一种形式的战争。我们的军事力量必须能够成功地应付可能强加于我们的任何意外事件，从有限的紧急事件直到全面的原子核大战。
    军队和军事人员的数量——
    本预算在1961财政年度中将使我国军事力量继续保持大约目前的水平——在年底现役的男女兵员为二百四十八万九千名。这支要维持的武装部队包括：陆军十四个师，八十七万人；海军现役舰只八百一十七艘，六十一万九千人；海军陆战队三个师和三个航空联队，十七万五千人；空军九十一个作战联队，八十二万五千人。
    国会在去年中止了它以前对陆军后备部队所加的最低人数的限制。在1960年国防部拨款法案中包含的对陆军国民警卫队的兵力所加的相似的限制也应当取消。我坚决建议国会取消对后备部队的数目所加的强制性的最低限制，以使得我们能够灵活地进行调整以适应军事需要。
    我再次建议，到1961财政年度结束时，陆军国民警卫队从现有的四十万人减到三十万人，陆军后备部队从现有三十万人减到二十七万人。
    采购、研究和建设——
    国防部开支的将近45％用在采购、武器发展和建设计划方面。1961财政年度这些开支估计为一百八十九亿美元。
    本预算所建议的1961财政年度飞机采购（不包括有关的研究和建设方面的数字）方面的新订合同权共为四十七亿五千三百万美元，比1960财政年度批准数字减少十三亿九千万美元。另一方面，建议1961财政年度的导弹采购（不包括研究和建设）方面的新订合同权为三十八亿二千五百万美元，比1960财政年度增加五亿八千一百万美元。采购方面的这种相反的趋势反映了我国武装部队的组成和任务在今后年代里预期会发生的变化。
    要规定合理水平的军事实力而又不至于危及我们的安全的其他重要方面，这一任务由于科学上的迅速发展而大为复杂。过去几年内出现了也许是历史上最迅速的先进的军事技术。某些武器系统尚在生产的时候就变得过时了，有些则尚在发展的时候就变得过时了。
    再则，某一武器系统的出人意料的迅速发展或是在技术上有新发现，其本身常常减少了其他竞争性系统的相对重要性。这就使得有必要不断研究和重新估计防御计划，以便重新调度资源，把它们投在较新的和较重要的武器系统上，以及停止或者减少在那些已经过时的武器系统上所作的努力。因此，在过去几年内，有一些在开始发展时看来很有希望的计划后来完全取消了。例如，设计来供水面潜水艇发射用的、很有希望的、舰对地的、空气动力导弹“雷古拉斯第二”导弹的重要性，由于成功地加速更先进得多的、由水下潜艇发射的“北极星”式弹道导弹而大大减少了。
    另一个例子就是最近取消了F—108型飞机，这是一种速度为音速三倍的远程截击机，设计这种飞机是为了在六十年代中期用来对付有人驾驶的轰炸机的。在弹道导弹技术方面取得的巨大进展，正在迅速地使主要威胁从有人驾驶的轰炸机转移到导弹方面。考虑到F—108型飞机的高昂费用——计划的部队需要四十多亿美元——以及这种飞机将可以使用的时期，决定停止这项工程的进一步工作。
    其他重要计划的大小和规模已经比早些时候的计划有所缩小。在这方面值得注意的就是“丘辟特式”和“雷神式”中程弹道导弹。这种导弹已经顺利地发展、生产和部署，但是由于“阿特拉斯式”弹道导弹可以使用的程度日益增加，它们的相对重要性减少了。
    战略部队——
    我国武装部队的威慑力量来自它们的核报复能力和它们在任何形式的战争中进行其他必要活动的能力。代表第一种能力的是有人驾驶的轰炸机、以航空母舰为基地的飞机以及洲际导弹和中程导弹的联合力量。代表第二种能力的是我们分布在重要的前沿地区的陆海空军部队，以及能够在紧急情况下迅速增援的随时准备着的后备部队。
    战略空军司令部是我们的远程核能力的主要因素。在本预算中必须作出的重要而困难的决定之一涉及B—70——一种远程超音速轰炸机——的作用。这种飞机原来计划在大约1965年可以用于初步的实际战斗。这种飞机将是对预定在早些时候可以使用的四种战略弹道导弹系统的补充，同时也同这些系统进行竞争。第一批“阿特拉斯式”洲际弹道导弹现在已经可以实际使用，头两艘“北极星”潜水艇预料可以在本日历年内使用，第一批“大力神式”洲际弹道导弹可以在明年使用，按照计划，“民兵式”固体燃料洲际弹道导弹计划大约在1962年年中可以实际使用。到1965年，这些系统中的一部分和全部将已经得到充分的试验，而且它们的可靠性将可以完全得到肯定。
    因此，B—70作为一种战略武器系统是否需要就值得怀疑了。但是我建议对B—70的飞机结构和引擎的发展工作继续进行。预料在1963年有两种原型飞机可以用作试验飞行。到那时我们应当可以处于有利得多的地位来决定这种飞机作为一种武器系统的价值。
    我建议更多地购买作了改进的B—42（有新的涡轮引擎的B—52），并采购B—58超音速中型轰炸机，以及支援性的加油飞机。这些增加的新式轰炸机将代替较旧的B—47中型轰炸机；一架B—52能够完成它所替代的几架B—47的工作。本预算中还包括继续用“猎狗式”空对地导弹装备B—52联队的经费。
    在下一财政年度中，还将采购更多的“阿特拉斯式”导弹、“大力神式”导弹和“北极星式”导弹。我建议提供一些款项，以便在下一财政年度中再开始生产三艘“北极星”潜艇，并预先采购定货时间和交货时间相隔很长的另外三艘的部件——这样就可以有总共十五艘“北极星”潜艇和相当数目的导弹。本预算中也列入继续发展和开始生产第一批可以实际使用的“民兵式”导弹的经费。
    因此在下一财政年度中将发展和生产四项战略弹道导弹系统。这些导弹系统，加上有人驾驶的轰炸机部队、以航空母舰为基地的飞机、中程弹道导弹和部署在国外的战术飞机，可以保证我们在一旦我们自己或者我们的盟国遭到攻击的时候具有进行有效的报复的连续的能力。
    为了在切实可行的范围内确保这些部队的安全和使这些部队作好准备，我们已经在很大程度上完成了分散战略空军司令部飞机和建造警报设备的工作。这些措施可以使我们的全部有人驾驶的轰炸机和支援性的加油飞机中有一大部分在得到攻击警报之后十五分钟以内起飞。
    防空部队——
    为了应付日益增加的导弹威胁，我们迫切要求建成一个侦察弹道导弹的进攻的新系统——弹道导弹早发警报系统。它的建设工作过去两年来一直在进行中，第一部分可望在大约一年内开始工作。
    为了建立一支抵御弹道导弹进攻的积极的防御力量，我建议继续发展“奈克—宙斯”系统，但是它在下一财政年度内不会开始生产，因为在这期间将继续进行试验。
    海上控制部队——
    控制海洋和远洋地区和海上交通线是保持我们的国家安全的工作中的一个不可分割的因素。担负这方面的主要责任的海军部队将是八百十七艘作战和支援舰只、十六个攻击航空母舰空军大队、十一个反潜水艇航空大队、四十一个巡逻和警报航空中队。
    海军在1961财政年度将从过去几年开始的新建和改建计划中接收数量异常大的现代化舰只。这将包括第五和第六艘“福莱斯特尔级”攻击航空母舰、第一艘核动力巡洋舰、九艘导弹驱逐舰、七艘导弹快速舰、六艘核动力潜水艇。另外三艘“北极星式”弹道导弹潜水艇和改建的导弹巡洋舰也将参加现役。
    我建议下一财政年度建造二十艘新舰只，并改建其他十五艘舰只或使这些舰只现代化。在新舰只中将包括一艘攻击航空母舰。目前计划这艘航空母舰装有常规的而不是原子核的发动机……
    军事援助——
    根据军事援助计划获得援助的国家的总的军事力量包括：大约五百万陆军部队，两千两百艘军舰，两万五千多架飞机，其中大约一半是喷气式飞机。这些部队对包括美国在内的自由世界的安全作出了极为重大的贡献。
    在1961财政年度，军事援助计划的预算同国防部的其他活动和计划列在一起，在军事援助的管理、组织和计划方面，正在作重大的改变。
    建议为1961年财政年度军事援助计划提供的二十亿美元的新订合同权，将提供为支持受援国军队所需要的训练和物资数量。
    在这个现代武器的时代，西欧的防务代价很大，因此必须通过北大西洋公约组织一切国家的共同努力才能完成。在这些国家中间，有许多国家现在已经负起了财政上的责任来生产或购买以前由美国供应的常规武器和装备。同时，1961年的军事援助计划正好面临着对价格昂贵的新武器的迫切需要，在这种武器方面，自由世界仍然指望从美国得到帮助。此外，这个计划规定加强训练工作，以便保证盟国军队有效地使用和保持这种新装备。
    本预算还规定向世界其他地方正在建立反对侵略和颠覆的防务的国家提供军事援助。其中许多国家已经参加了像东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织等共同防御组织，或者同美国签订了双边防御协定。这些国家大多数在近东和远东，对它们的援助首先着重于根据各个地区的威胁性质来加强常规部队。
    原子能活动——
    1961财政年度给原子能委员会的经费预期保持在1960财政年度的约二十七亿美元的水平。研究和发展活动的大量增加。
    1961财政年度核武器的发展和生产将保持在前几年的高水平上。大力发展军用反应堆以供各种推进和发电之用的工作将继续进行。当供一艘驱逐舰使用的陆上原型反应堆在1961财政年度同目前已经在使用的其他四个海军原型反应堆一样投入工作时，核发动机将能供各种主要型式的海军兵舰使用。1961财政年度海军反应堆发展的重点主要将放在发展改进的、更经久耐用的反应堆燃料方面。发展核能冲压式喷气引擎和核飞机引擎以及供遥远的军事基地使用的核发电厂的工作将继续进行。
    和平利用原子能——
    1961财政年度在利用原子能发展民用电力方面的开支估计为二亿五千万美元。其中一亿八千五百万美元用于研究和发展方面，六千五百万美元用于建立民用发电反应堆和有关的发展设施方面。
    委员会在1961财政年度用于研究自然科学和关于生命的科学方面的开支将再度大大增加到二亿一千万美元以上。
    在支持民用空间计划方面，原子能委员会将继续发展核能火箭和供空间载运工具使用的小型的、耐久的核能源。关于热核动力和把核爆炸物应用于各种民用事业的发展工作，在1961财政年度将继续进行。
    储存及扩大防御生产——
    在储存战略和重要物资方面的目标多数已经完成。目前继续在根据合同获得物资，以扩大防御生产，但获得物资的速度已减慢，因为目前继续有效的这类合同的数目在减少。因此，储存和扩大防御生产的开支概算将从1960财政年度的二亿三千万美元减少到1961财政年度的一亿三千四百万美元。
    国际事务和财政
    美国正在继续支持维护世界和平和改善整个自由世界经济状况的各种计划。在帮助改善经济状况方面，多边计划正在扩大。同时，由于经济发展的迫切需要，因此要求继续在共同安全计划下提供大量的经济援助。
    国际事务和财政方面的开支概算在1961财政年度为二十二亿美元。这个数字比1960财政年度的开支概算增加一亿七千七百万美元，这主要是因为开发贷款基金会根据以前所承担的义务而支出的数目增加了。
    共同安全计划——
    通过整个共同安全计划，美国将帮助促进不发达国家的稳定和经济发展，并且将帮助加强自由世界的防御。因此，建议1961财政年度的新订合同权为四十一亿七千五百万美元，比1960财政年度通过的数目增加九亿四千九百万美元（其中七亿美元是用于军事援助）。开支概算为三十四亿五千万美元，比1960财政年度增加一亿美元。
    开发贷款基金会——
    开发贷款基金会是在1957年成立的，目的是要在不发达国家不能从其他方面得到资金时对它们提供资金。这种资金是按照有利的条件提供的，往往包括这样一项规定，可以用借款者本国货币偿还。到1960财政年度结束时，开发贷款基金会将已经承担了大约一百四十八笔贷款、总计大约十四亿美元的义务。在1961财政年度，开支概算为三亿美元，比1960财政年度增加一亿二千五百万美元。要求1961财政年度有新订合同权七亿美元，比1960财政年度通过的数目增加一亿五千万美元。这将提供贷款的经费，这种经费对我们的援助自由世界不发达国家发展经济的外交政策目标是至为必要的。
    防御支持——
    许多参加共同防御的不发达国家维持着大量的军事部队，这些部队的开支使他们的有限的经济资源感到非常紧张。为了帮助维持政治和经济的稳定，并防止由于必要的防御部队的开支而不适当地阻挠经济发展，因此美国提供了经济援助，主要是供应消费品以及工业生产所用的原料和机器。在1961财政年度中，需要新订合同权七亿二千四百万美元，比1960财政年度所通过的数目增加二千九百万美元。
    特别援助——
    需要新订合同权二亿六千八百万美元，用来进行经济援助，以促进美国不维持其军事部队的自由世界各国的经济和政治稳定，并用于其他某些特殊计划。在某些情况下，这种援助同美国维持的军事基地间接有关。
    建议的1961财政年度特别援助的拨款比1960财政年度通过的数目增加二千三百万美元。还建议另外一些计划来帮助改进非洲的情况。
    处理外交事务——
    国务院目前正在制订计划，以便进一步加强1961财政年度外交事务的处理。语文训练计划将加以扩大。将在非洲、拉丁美洲、南亚和东欧设立新的外交和领事职位。为了进行诸如此类的活动，要求为1961财政年度提供二亿零五百万美元的新订合同权。
    关于对外新闻和交流活动——要求为1961财政年度的对外新闻和交流活动提供总计一亿六千八百万美元的新订合同权。美国新闻署打算扩大它在非洲和拉丁美洲的计划，包括在非洲建造一座新的“美国之音”发报台。美国新闻署将更多地利用越来越多的海外电视设备。同大约八十个其他国家的重要人物互相访问的次数将增加，特别侧重于领导人物和教师的互相访问。
