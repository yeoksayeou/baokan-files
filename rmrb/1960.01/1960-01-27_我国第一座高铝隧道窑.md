    China's First High-Alumina Tunnel Kiln
    The Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Refractory Materials Plant has built China's first high-alumina tunnel kiln. The kiln has already produced its first batch of high-quality high-alumina bricks.
    High-alumina bricks are advanced refractory materials. This tunnel kiln can produce 40,000 tons of high-quality high-alumina bricks annually. It utilizes Wuhan Iron and Steel's coking gas for direct heating, thereby saving investment in the construction of a gas mixing and pressurization station.

    我国第一座高铝隧道窑
    武汉钢铁公司耐火材料厂建成我国第一座高铝隧道窑。目前这座窑已经生产出第一批优质高铝砖。
    高铝砖是高级耐火材料。这座隧道每年能够生产四万吨优质高铝砖。它利用武钢炼焦煤气直接加热，因而节省了建设煤气混合加压站的投资。
