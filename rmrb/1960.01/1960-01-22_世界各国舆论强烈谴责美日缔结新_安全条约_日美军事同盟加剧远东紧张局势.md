TASS commentator Harikov points out:
Japan plays the role of the accomplice of the United States in Asia
Xinhua News Agency, January 20th - According to TASS, Moscow, January 19th: TASS commentator Harikov wrote: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi today signed the new military treaty with the United States in Washington. With the signing of the new treaty, Japan has become even more dependent on the United States. According to this treaty, the United States can actually have the right to ask the Japanese army to conduct joint military operations.

Harikov pointed out that US news agencies are trying to convince people that with the signing of the new US-Japan military treaty, the United States and Japan have become "partners in common defense." But what kind of partners have they become? Japan will still be an unequal junior partner, and in essence, Japan's fate is to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States in possible military conflicts in the Far East. Due to the signing of a new military treaty with the United States, Japan will involuntarily become a warehouse for atomic and hydrogen weapons, and all the consequences will arise from this.

Harikov said that the "brink of war" policy pursued by the Nobusuke Kishi government almost dragged Japan into the conflict launched by the United States in the Taiwan Strait. The scope of activities of the new treaty will be extended to the Philippines. Everyone knows that this area is a particularly turbulent area. The United States has military obligations to Chiang Kai-shek elements, Syngman Rhee elements, and the Ngo Dinh Diem regime in South Vietnam. Actions by the US military under these obligations will almost automatically drag the Japanese army into it. Any "prior consultation" cannot overturn the logic of this fact, because this "consultation" is purely a formality.

Harikov pointed out that due to the signing of a new military treaty with the United States, Japan will act as an accomplice of the United States in taking military measures in Asia. In this way, Japan has become a source of tension in the Far East, threatening peace in the region. Peace-loving people in Asia will not forget the towering crimes of Japanese militarism, and the new treaty is creating such broad possibilities for the resurgence of Japanese militarism.

Harikov said that the new US-Japan military treaty is contrary to the spirit of the times, and it puts Japan in a position that runs counter to easing international tensions. Now, when the whole world is applauding the Soviet Union's historic decision, public opinion justly regards the military alliance concluded in Washington as a challenge to peace-loving people.

Korean "Labor News" published an editorial pointing out
The ugly face of US imperialism’s false peace and true war preparations is fully exposed
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 21st - The Korean "Labor News" published an editorial today condemning the governments of Japan and the United States for signing a new military alliance treaty.

The editorial pointed out that the aggressive spearhead of the new US-Japan military alliance treaty is directly aimed at socialist countries such as Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, and threatens all Asian countries struggling for national independence and maintaining peace.

The editorial emphasized that the conclusion of the new US-Japan military alliance treaty more clearly exposed the vicious face of US imperialism, which verbally flaunts "peace" but actually intensifies new war preparations.

The editorial said that the Korean people actively support and sympathize with the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty.

The "Democratic Korea Daily" published an editorial today saying that all the Korean people will resolutely fight to the end against the US-Japan military alliance treaty. The editorial said that US imperialism must withdraw from all regions of Asia, including South Korea and Japan, and remove its military bases. The editorial advocates establishing a nuclear-weapon-free peace zone in Asia.

Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary pointing out
The adventurous behavior of US-Japan warmongers can certainly be stopped
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 21st - The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today, strongly condemning the signing of the new US-Japan "security treaty" that endangers the Japanese people and the Asian people.

The commentary said that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and US Secretary of State Herter, ignoring the growing struggle movement of the Japanese people and the opposition of Asian people and world opinion, signed a new US-Japan "security treaty" in Washington on January 19. This action shows that US imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi clique are very stubbornly adhering to the conspiracy policy of preparing to launch aggressive wars and promoting the revival of Japanese militarism. The commentary said, however, that this does not mean that imperialism and its lackeys can do whatever they want, and the Japanese people and the Asian people will never allow them to run rampant. The Japanese people, for their own survival and to be responsible to the Asian people, will carry out a more tenacious struggle. The commentary said that the Asian people, including the Vietnamese people, will further heighten their vigilance, strengthen their unity, and carry out a more powerful struggle. The commentary finally expressed its firm belief that the adventurous behavior of US imperialist warmongers and Japanese militarists can certainly be stopped.

Mongolian News Agency commentator pointed out
Japanese reactionaries have issued a challenge to Asian countries
Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, January 20th - A diplomatic commentator of the Mongolian News Agency said in a commentary today that the signing of a new "security treaty" between Japan and the United States is an act of dragging Japan onto the road of military adventure and threatening peace in the Far East and Asia.

The commentary pointed out that the Japanese reactionaries, ignoring the peace aspirations of the Japanese working people, have issued a challenge to Japan's neighbors and other peace-loving countries in Asia that have suffered deeply from Japanese aggression in the past. The people and governments of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries have sternly condemned the militarist policy of the Nobusuke Kishi government.

The commentator went on to say that the provocative actions of the Japanese ruling clique have aroused the justified concerns of the Mongolian people, because they have fresh memories of the Halhin Gol incident in which Japan invaded Mongolia. The Mongolian public is vigilantly watching the aggressive conspiracies of the Japanese militarists.

Not only the Asian people who have suffered deeply from the Japanese army's aggression, but also the broad public opinion of the world unanimously condemns the current foreign policy direction of the Japanese government.

The commentator finally pointed out that although the US and Japanese governments have signed a new "security treaty," the Japanese public's struggle against forming a military alliance with the United States has not ended. In their just struggle to achieve democratic and peaceful development in their own country, the Japanese people will continue to receive the support of the people of Asian countries and the peace-loving people of the world.

Czechoslovak newspapers and radio commentary pointed out
Nobusuke Kishi is a docile pawn of US imperialism and Japanese arms merchants
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 19th - The Czechoslovak "People's Front Daily" published a commentary today entitled "Dangerous 'Security Treaty'," commenting on the US-Japan military alliance treaty that is about to be signed in Washington. The commentary said that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, who went to Washington to sign this treaty with the United States, is not a representative of the Japanese people, but a docile pawn of US imperialism and Japanese arms merchant consortia.

Czechoslovak Radio broadcast a commentary on the US-Japan military alliance treaty on the 18th. The commentary pointed out that this treaty gives the United States the opportunity to turn Japan into its main strategic base in the entire Far East region. The commentary pointed out that the late US Secretary of State Dulles participated in the formulation of the US-Japan military alliance treaty from the very beginning. He once openly demanded the establishment of nuclear weapon zones around the Soviet Union and China, and dreamed of establishing a Northeast Asian treaty with Japan as its core. The commentary said that for the Japanese people, the treaty that is about to be signed not only means a new danger that is even more terrible than the danger that occurred in Hiroshima, but also means that the living conditions of the Japanese people will be further deteriorated due to increased armaments.

### 世界各国舆论强烈谴责美日缔结新“安全条约”  日美军事同盟加剧远东紧张局势

    世界各国舆论强烈谴责美日缔结新“安全条约”
    日美军事同盟加剧远东紧张局势
    塔斯社评论员哈里科夫指出
    日本充当了美国在亚洲的帮凶角色
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：塔斯社评论员哈里科夫写道：日本首相岸信介今天在华盛顿在同美国缔结的新军事条约上签了字。随着新条约的签订，日本就更得依赖美国了。根据这项条约，美国实际上可以有权要日本军队来进行联合军事行动。
    哈里科夫指出，美国通讯社试图令人相信，随着新的日美军事条约的签订，日美两国已成了“共同防御的伙伴”。但是，究竟成了什么样的伙伴呢？日本仍然将是不平等的小伙伴，实质上日本的命运是要在远东可能发生的军事冲突中为美国火中取栗。由于同美国签订新的军事条约，日本将不由自己地变成原子武器和氢武器的仓库并由此而产生一切后果。
    哈里科夫说，岸信介政府追随的“战争边缘”政策差一点一度把日本拖入美国在台湾海峡发起的冲突中去。新条约的活动范围将扩展到菲律宾地区。大家都知道，这个地区是特别不安宁的地区。美国同蒋介石分子、李承晚分子和南越吴庭艳制度有着军事义务的关系。美国军队根据这些义务而进行的行动几乎会自动地把日本军队拖进去。任何“事先磋商”都不能推翻这个事实的逻辑，因为，这种“磋商”纯粹是一种形式而已。
    哈里科夫指出，由于同美国签订新的军事条约，日本将充当美国在亚洲采取军事措施的帮凶的角色。这样，日本就成了远东地区紧张局势的策源地，威胁着这个地区的和平。爱好和平的亚洲人民不会忘记日本军国主义的滔天罪行，而新条约正为日本军国主义死灰复燃创造了如此广泛的可能性。
    哈里科夫说，新的日美军事条约是违背时代精神的，它使日本处于同缓和国际紧张局势背道而驰的地位。现在，当全世界都鼓掌欢迎苏联的有历史意义的决定的时候，舆论公正地把在华盛顿缔结的军事同盟看作是向爱好和平人民的挑战。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论指出
    美帝国主义的假和平真备战的面目暴露无遗
    据新华社平壤21日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论，谴责日美两国政府签订新的军事同盟条约。
    社论指出，新的日美军事同盟条约的侵略矛头直接指向朝鲜、中国和苏联等社会主义国家，并且威胁着为争取民族独立、维护和平而斗争的一切亚洲国家。
    社论强调说，新的日美军事同盟条约的缔结更加清楚地暴露了美帝国主义在口头上标榜“和平”，而在实际行动中加紧新战争准备的凶恶面目。
    社论说，朝鲜人民积极支持和同情日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争。
    “民主朝鲜报”今天发表社论说，全体朝鲜人民将为反对日美军事同盟条约坚决斗争到底。社论说，美帝国主义必须从包括南朝鲜和日本在内的亚洲所有地区撤走，并且撤除它的军事基地。社论主张在亚洲建立无原子武器的和平地区。
    越南“人民报”发表评论指出
    美日好战分子的冒险行为一定能够制止
    据新华社河内21日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论，严厉谴责危害日本人民和亚洲人民的新的日美“安全条约”的签订。
    评论说，日本首相岸信介和美国国务卿赫脱无视日本人民日益壮大的斗争运动以及亚洲人民和世界舆论的反对，于1月19日在华盛顿签订了新的日美“安全条约”。这个行动表明美帝国主义和岸信介集团非常顽固地坚持准备发动侵略战争和促使日本军国主义复活的阴谋政策。评论说，可是，这并不意味着帝国主义和它的走狗可以为所欲为，日本人民和亚洲人民决不容许他们横行霸道。日本人民为了自己的生存，为了对亚洲人民负起责任，他们将进行更顽强的斗争，评论说，亚洲人民，其中包括越南人民在内也将进一步提高警惕，加强团结，进行更加强大的斗争。评论最后深信一定能够制止美帝国主义好战分子和日本军国主义分子的冒险行为。
    蒙古通讯社评论员指出
    日本反动派向亚洲国家发出了挑战
    新华社乌兰巴托20日电　蒙古通讯社外交评论员今天在一篇评论中说，日本和美国签订新的“安全条约”，是把日本拖上军事冒险和威胁远东以及亚洲和平的道路的行为。
    评论指出，日本反动派无视日本劳动人民的和平愿望，向日本的邻国和过去深受日本侵略之害的亚洲其他爱好和平的国家发出了挑战。苏联、中国和其他国家的人民和政府严厉谴责岸信介政府的军国主义方针。
    评论员接着说，日本统治集团的挑衅行为引起了蒙古人民的合理忧虑，因为他们对日本侵略蒙古的哈尔新河事件记忆犹新。蒙古公众警惕地注视着日本军国主义者的侵略阴谋。
    不仅深受日军侵略之害的亚洲人民，而且世界广大公众也一致谴责日本政府当前的外交政策方针。
    评论员最后指出，虽然美国和日本政府签订了新的“安全条约”，但是，日本公众反对同美国结成军事同盟的斗争并没有结束。日本人民在他们争取本国民主和平发展的正义斗争中，将继续得到亚洲各国人民以及世界爱好和平人民的支持。
    捷克斯洛伐克报纸和电台评论指出
    岸信介是美帝国主义和日本军火商的驯服的走卒
    据新华社布拉格19日电　捷克斯洛伐克“人民防线报”今天发表题为“危险的‘安全条约’”的评论，评即将在华盛顿签订的日美军事同盟条约。评论说，到华盛顿同美国签订这项条约的日本首相岸信介不是日本人民的代表，而是美国帝国主义和日本军火商财团的驯服的走卒。
    捷克斯洛伐克广播电台18日就日美军事同盟条约发表了评论。评论指出，这项条约给予美国把日本变成它在整个远东地区的主要战略基地的机会。评论指出，美国已故国务卿杜勒斯从一开始就参与了制订日美军事同盟条约的工作，他曾经公开要求在苏联及中国周围建立核武器地区，并梦想成立以日本为核心的东北亚条约。评论说，对日本人民说，即将签订的条约不仅意味着比在广岛发生过的危险更可怕的新危险，而且也意味着日本人的生活条件将因增加军备而更加恶化。
