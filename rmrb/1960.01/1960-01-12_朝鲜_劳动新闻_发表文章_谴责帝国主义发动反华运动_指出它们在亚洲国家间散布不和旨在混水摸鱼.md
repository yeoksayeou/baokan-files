Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th. The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an article on the 9th, condemning the Western imperialist reactionary groups and revisionists headed by the US imperialists for their frantic and comprehensive anti-China movement, believing it to be a reckless act by those who are hostile to China and have been defeated.

The article pointed out that they fear that the victory of the Chinese people will greatly affect the fate of the world, and will have a huge attraction to all oppressed countries and the people of the world. This is why they are frantically opposing China at any cost.

The newspaper pointed out that the imperialists are once again playing the trick of sowing seeds of discord and hatred among Asian countries, attempting to fish in troubled waters. In this way, their conspiracy to use the Sino-Indian border issue and the Indonesian Chinese issue in this anti-China movement is obvious.

The article said that at present, the warmongering ruling clique in the United States is busy visiting some peace-loving Asian countries. What they are looking for in their visits is clearly revealed in Eisenhower's speech in the Indian Parliament, where he said that the United States has sufficient military power to assist the countries of the "free world camp."

The article pointed out that the imperialists' anti-China clamor is to cover up the failure of their previous anti-China movements. They had adopted various despicable and malicious means—military provocations, subversive activities, "economic blockades," slander and libel—to oppose the People's Republic of China, but all failed. The article pointed out that in the face of the bankruptcy of these anti-China methods, the US imperialists even created the so-called "Tibet issue" in the United Nations last year.

The article said that their provocation against the People's Republic of China is as foolish as hitting their heads against a wall. The article emphasized: The imperialists' clamoring against the People's Republic of China, which has 650 million people united around the Chinese Communist Party, will be defeated. Although they stubbornly obstruct the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, the prestige of the People's Republic of China on the international stage has not been damaged at all, but has instead increased day by day. The People's Republic of China will continue to vigorously advance towards socialism and communism.

    谴责帝国主义发动反华运动
    指出它们在亚洲国家间散布不和旨在混水摸鱼
    新华社平壤9日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”9日发表文章，谴责以美帝国主义者为首的西方帝国主义反动集团和修正主义者疯狂的全面反华运动，认为这是那些敌视中国而遭到失败的人的鲁莽行动。
    文章指出，他们害怕中国人民的胜利会大大影响世界的命运，并且对一切被压迫的国家和世界人民产生巨大的吸引力，这就是他们不惜任何代价疯狂地反对中国的原因。
    这家报纸指出，帝国主义者再次玩弄在亚洲国家之间散布不和和仇恨的种子的诡计，企图混水摸鱼，这样一来，在这次反华运动中他们企图利用中印边界问题和印度尼西亚华侨问题的阴谋也就昭然若揭。
    文章说，目前，美国好战的统治集团正在忙于访问一些爱好和平的亚洲国家。他们在访问中要寻找的东西在艾森豪威尔在印度议会里的讲话中明显地露出来了，他说，美国有足够的军事力量来援助“自由世界阵营”的国家。
    文章指出，帝国主义者的反华叫嚣，是为了掩盖他们先前发动的反华运动的失败。他们曾经采用了各种卑鄙恶毒的手段——军事挑衅，颠覆活动，“经济封锁”，中伤和诽谤——来反对中华人民共和国，但是都失败了。文章指出，在这些反华手段都破产了的情况下，美帝国主义者竟在去年在联合国里制造所谓“西藏问题”。
    文章说，他们对中华人民共和国的挑衅，就像把自己的头去撞墙壁一样愚蠢。文章强调说：帝国主义者对有六亿五千万人民团结在中国共产党周围的中华人民共和国的叫嚷将遭到失败。虽然他们顽固地阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位，但是中华人民共和国在国际舞台上的威信根本没有受到破坏，反而日益提高。中华人民共和国将继续生气勃勃地向社会主义和共产主义迈进。
