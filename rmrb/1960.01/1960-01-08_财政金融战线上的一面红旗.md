Editorial: A Red Banner on the Financial and Monetary Front

    Under the leadership of the Party, the financial and monetary cadres of Jiangyou County, Sichuan Province, have been going all out, aiming high, doing everything possible to increase revenue, ensuring the needs of production and construction funds, and at the same time, keeping pace with the central work step by step, serving the needs of production in everything. They have made financial and monetary work lively and vigorous, promoting the great leap forward in production and construction, and supporting the consolidation and development of the people's communes, becoming a red banner on the financial and monetary front.
    On the surface, financial work is nothing more than revenue and expenditure, and banking work is nothing more than deposits and loans. However, whether the principle of putting politics in command is adhered to, and whether the method of mass movement is adopted, the effects are completely different. From today's report in this newspaper about the Jiangyou Branch of the People's Bank of China, we can see that the comrades in the financial departments and banks of Jiangyou County regard agricultural loans and the state's financial support to the communes not only as economic work, but first and foremost as political work and mass work. The outstanding achievements of Jiangyou's financial and monetary work are precisely the result of adhering to the principle of putting politics in command and vigorously carrying out mass movements.
    What are the main experiences of Jiangyou County's financial and monetary work?
    The most important experience of Jiangyou County's financial and monetary work in carrying out mass movements is to actively serve the development of production and the consolidation and strengthening of the people's communes. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The quality of financial policy certainly has an impact on the economy, but it is the economy that determines finance. There has never been a case where financial difficulties could be solved without an economic foundation, nor has there been a case where finance could be enriched without economic development." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. 3: "Economic and Financial Problems During the Anti-Japanese War") Following this fundamental principle of financial work put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong, our financial and monetary work achieved great achievements during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, promoted the development of production, and supported the victory of the war. Today, in the period of socialist construction, this principle remains the only correct one to guide our financial and monetary work. During the period of socialist construction, the central task of the Party is to develop production at high speed. Therefore, financial and monetary work must start from production in everything, and do everything possible to promote the development of production. Before August 1959, the financial departments of Jiangyou County, due to the lack of a clear production perspective, mainly started from revenue and expenditure, satisfied with "calculating, checking, and managing". Some even one-sidedly believed that financial work was complete as long as they "collected money according to policy and allocated funds according to plan", so the work did not progress quickly. After September, inspired by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and after opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, this situation was fundamentally changed. They actively participated in production, organized production, and promoted production, assisting the people's communes in developing diversified operations, increasing the communes' cash income, and helping county-owned and commune-owned steel enterprises improve their management, reduce costs, and turn losses into profits. Financial work served production, promoted the development of production, and at the same time, financial work itself took on a new look. In the first eight months of 1959, Jiangyou County only completed 53% of the annual fiscal revenue plan, but in the next two months and four days, it completed more than 47% of the annual plan, completing the annual fiscal task 57 days ahead of schedule.
    The second experience of Jiangyou County's financial and monetary work in carrying out mass movements is to resolutely rely on the Party committee and keep pace with the central work step by step. They said, "We actively respond to the Party committee's call, and we resolutely implement the Party committee's decisions." Here, relying on the leadership of the Party is not passively and negatively relying on the Party committee in everything, or only asking the Party committee for help when encountering difficulties in work. Instead, it is to always care about and be familiar with the Party's work arrangements at various stages, and closely center the departmental work around the Party's central work, so that the departmental work serves the Party's central work. At the same time, during the work process, they also frequently and actively report the situation in the work to the Party committee, and put forward requests or reports with situations, analyses, and measures, so that the Party committee can be familiar with the situation of the departmental work. This makes the entire banking work completely under the leadership of the Party committee, and the central tasks of the Party committee at various stages become the central content of the department's red banner movement, closely integrating the red banner movement with the central work. The reason why Jiangyou County's agricultural loan work and the work of helping poor teams catch up with rich teams can form a broad mass movement and achieve outstanding results is precisely because these works are closely centered around the Party's central work at that time.
    The third experience of Jiangyou County's financial and monetary work in carrying out mass movements is the combination of internal and external forces, and the cooperation of all parties. The nature of financial and monetary work and its position determine that the completion of financial and monetary tasks must rely on the joint efforts of both internal employees and the external masses. Therefore, the mass movement of financial and monetary work must implement the principle of combining internal and external forces and cooperating together. Before April 1959, in the work of assisting enterprises in managing working capital and reducing costs, the production units, enterprise leadership departments, and financial and banking departments all grasped one aspect of financial work, but each had its own tasks and plans. However, the fundamental problems in production could not be solved. Therefore, in order to solve the problems of chaotic finances and high costs of newly built enterprises, the county party committee organized these departments and established a "Enterprise Financial Leadership Team". Under the unified leadership of the leadership team, all units worked together to ensure that the problems in production, finance, and cost were solved in a timely manner, completely overcoming the past situation of scattered forces and each doing its own thing. Under the conditions of internal and external integration and mutual cooperation, many problems that the financial and monetary departments previously thought could not be solved were smoothly solved after mobilizing the masses. And the financial and monetary departments, using their characteristic of wide contact, can offer ideas, act as consultants, and link up in all directions, assisting all parties, and can indeed do many good things for the production departments. Rural savings work has always emphasized the shortage of people and the large amount of work, making it difficult to do well. However, by establishing savings groups through canteens and credit stations through production teams, integrating savings with the production and life of the masses, and adapting to the needs of the masses, savings work has become a component of the people's economic life, and many problems have been solved easily.
    The advanced experience of Jiangyou County's financial and monetary work tells us that only by correctly handling the relationship between departmental work and central work, the relationship between financial and monetary work and production and construction, and the relationship between the work of this department and other departments, can there be a vigorous and down-to-earth mass movement, and can the high-speed development of production and construction be better promoted. At present, in some places, the mass movement of financial and monetary work is not large enough, precisely because they have not handled or have not completely correctly handled the above three aspects of the relationship as Jiangyou County did. We emphasize that the departmental work of finance and banking serves the central work, precisely in order to make the departmental work play a greater role in serving the central work, so as to do the departmental work better. Emphasizing mutual cooperation does not mean that there can be no division of labor. Business work and production, division of labor and cooperation are an organic unity. Only by caring about the overall situation, caring about the central work, and caring about production can the business work of finance and banking be done well. The more detailed the division of labor, the more necessary it is to strengthen cooperation. Only by combining internal and external forces and cooperating with each other can we support each other and leap forward together. To learn from the experience of Jiangyou County, we must correctly understand these problems and creatively apply them to our own practical work.
    In 1960, while supporting the high-speed development of industrial production and construction, financial and monetary work should also vigorously support agricultural production, support the people's communes, and support the technical transformation of agriculture. Comrades in rural financial and monetary work, by flexibly applying the experience of Jiangyou County to your own work, will make greater contributions to the development of agricultural production and the consolidation and improvement of the communes. Comrades in urban and industrial and mining area financial and monetary work, strive to create new experiences suitable for the characteristics of cities and industrial and mining areas based on the experience of Jiangyou County, so that the work of finance and banking in supporting production and construction and arranging people's lives can be done more vividly. All comrades on the financial and monetary front, go all out, advance victoriously, and make greater contributions to a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960!

### 财政金融战线上的一面红旗

    财政金融战线上的一面红旗
    四川省江油县的财政金融干部，在党的领导下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，千方百计地增加收入，保证了生产建设资金的需要，同时步步跟上中心工作，事事服务于生产需要，把财政金融工作作得生动活泼，有声有色，促进了生产建设的大跃进，支持了人民公社的巩固和发展，成为财政金融战线上的一面红旗。
    从表面上看，财政工作不外一收一支，银行工作不外一存一贷，但是同样是一收一支，一存一贷，是否坚持政治挂帅，是否采取群众运动的方法，效果却截然不同。从今天本报关于人民银行江油支行的报道中，我们可以看出，江油县财政部门和银行的同志们，把农业贷款、国家对公社的财政支援这样的工作，不仅当作经济工作去做，而且首先是当作政治工作去做，当作群众工作去做。江油的财政金融工作所以取得出色的成绩，正是坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动的结果。
    什么是江油县财政金融工作的主要经验呢？
    江油县财政金融工作大搞群众运动的最重要的经验，是主动地为发展生产、为巩固和壮大人民公社服务。毛泽东同志说：“财政政策的好坏固然足以影响经济，但是决定财政的却是经济。未有经济无基础而可以解决财政困难的，未有经济不发展而可以使财政充裕的。”（毛泽东选集第三卷：“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”）遵循着毛泽东同志提出的财政工作的这个根本方针，在抗日战争期间、在解放战争期间，我们的财政金融工作取得了巨大的成就，促进了生产的发展，支持了战争的胜利，而在今天社会主义建设时期，这一方针仍然是指导我们财政金融工作的唯一正确的方针。在社会主义建设时期，党的中心任务，是高速度地发展生产。因此，财政金融工作必须事事从生产出发，千方百计地促进生产的发展。江油县的财政部门在1959年8月份以前，由于缺乏明确的生产观点，主要从一收一支出发，满足于“打打算算，查查管管”，甚至有人片面地认为，财政工作只要“按政策收钱，按计划拨款”，工作就到了顶，因而工作开展不快。9月份以后，在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，经过反右倾，鼓干劲，这种状况得到了根本改变。他们积极参与生产，组织生产，促进生产，协助人民公社开展多种经营，增加了公社的现金收入，帮助县属和公社钢铁企业改善经营管理，使这些企业降低了成本，转亏本为盈利。财政工作为生产服务，促进了生产的发展，同时财政工作本身也出现了新的面貌。江油县在1959年前八个月财政收入仅完成全年计划的53％，而后两个月零四天就完成了全年计划的47％以上，提前五十七天完成了全年的财政任务。
    江油县财政金融工作大搞群众运动的第二条经验，是坚决依靠党委，步步跟上中心工作。他们说：“党委有号召，我们就积极响应，党委有决定，我们就坚决执行”。在这里，依靠党的领导不是消极被动地事事依赖党委，或者工作中有了困难才去请党委帮助解决，而是时刻关心和熟悉党在各个时期的工作布置，紧紧围绕党的中心工作来安排部门工作，使部门工作为党的中心工作服务。同时，在工作进行中也经常地积极地向党委汇报工作中的情况，提出有情况、有分析、有措施的请示或报告，便于党委熟悉部门工作的情况。这样就使整个银行工作完全置于党委的领导之下，党委在各个时期的中心任务，也就是部门红旗运动的中心内容，把红旗运动同中心工作紧密地结合起来。江油县的农贷工作、帮穷队赶富队的工作所以能够形成广大的群众运动，取得出色的成绩，也正是因为这些工作是紧紧围绕着当时党的中心工作进行的。
    江油县财政金融工作大搞群众运动的第三条经验，是内外结合，各方协作。财政金融工作的性质和它所处的地位，决定了财政金融任务的完成必须依靠内部职工群众和外部群众两方面的共同努力。因此，财政金融工作的群众运动，必须实行内外结合共同协作的原则。1959年4月以前，江油县财政金融部门在协助企业管好流动资金和降低成本的工作中，生产单位，企业领导部门，财政银行部门都抓了财政工作的一个方面，但是各有各的任务，各有各的打算。而生产上的根本问题还是得不到解决。因此，县委为了解决新建企业财务较乱和成本偏高的问题，便把这些部门组织起来，成立了“企业财务领导小组”，各单位在领导小组的统一领导下，拧成一股绳，协同工作，使生产、财务、成本各方面的问题都及时得到了解决，完全克服了过去力量分散各搞一套的状况。在内外结合，互相协作的条件下，财政金融部门过去认为无法解决的许多问题，经过发动群众，就都顺利地解决了。而财政金融部门运用自己接触面广的特点，出主意，当参谋，四面挂钩，协助各方，确实也可以为生产部门作许多好事。农村储蓄工作，过去一直强调人少事多，工作难以做好，但是通过食堂建立储蓄组、通过生产队建立信用站，把储蓄同群众的生产和生活结合起来，适应了群众的要求，储蓄工作变成了人民经济生活的一个组成部分，许多问题都迎刃而解了。
    江油县财政金融工作的先进经验告诉我们：只有正确处理部门工作同中心工作的关系、财政金融工作同生产建设的关系、本部门的工作同其它部门的关系，才能有轰轰烈烈、踏踏实实的群众运动，才能更好地促进生产建设的高速度发展。目前有的地方，财政金融工作的群众运动所以声势还不够大，就是因为他们还没有像江油县那样正确处理或者没有完全正确处理以上三个方面的关系。我们强调财政金融的部门工作服务于中心工作，正是为了使部门工作在为中心工作服务中发挥更大的作用，从而把部门工作做得更好。强调互相协作，并不是说可以不要分工。业务工作和生产，分工和协作是有机的统一体。只有关心全局，关心中心工作，关心生产，财政金融的业务工作才能搞得好。愈是有细致的分工，愈要加强协作，只有内外结合，各方协作，才能互相支援，共同跃进。学习江油县的经验，就是要正确地认识这些问题，并且创造性地运用到自己的实际工作中去。
    1960年财政金融工作在支援工业生产建设高速度发展的同时，还要大力支援农业生产，支援人民公社，支援农业的技术改造。农村财政金融工作的同志们，把江油县的经验灵活地运用到自己的工作中去，将会对农业生产的发展和公社的巩固提高，作出更大的贡献。城乡和工矿区财政金融工作的同志们，根据江油县的经验努力创造出适合城市和工矿区特点的新的经验来，把财政金融支援生产建设，安排人民生活的工作，作得更加有声有色。全体财政金融战线上的同志们，鼓足干劲，乘胜前进，为1960年更好更全面的跃进作出更大的贡献吧！
