    Ugly Slave
    Lin Bi, words
    Fang Cheng, drawing
    The Prime Minister is busy betraying the country,
    His actions are hurried,
    His intentions are crazy,
    Daring to turn the homeland into an ammunition depot.
    Do not underestimate the power of the people,
    We must take the jackals,
    Throw them into the ocean,
    And look to Tojo for his fate!

    丑奴儿
    林碧　词
    方成　画
    首相先生卖国忙，
    行色仓惶，
    心意疯狂，
    敢把家园变弹仓。
    人民威力休轻觑，
    要把豺狼，
    扔进汪洋，
    且向东条看下场！
