Innovate Tools, Skillfully Manage Summer Fields
Deqing Commune in Wuxing County Reduces the Number of People Cultivating Spring Flowers and Improves Efficiency
Ye County Greatly Improves Tools to Enhance the Quality of Wheat Field Management

According to the Zhejiang Daily, the Deqing People's Commune in Wuxing County launched a mass movement to boldly create and improve tools during the spring flower field management campaign. Since late December of last year, in less than a month, the commune has created, imitated, and improved thirteen new tools for fertilizer transportation, application, ditch digging, and cultivation, and has already promoted more than 2,100 of them. Recently, bamboo tracks for transporting fertilizer and self-flowing bamboo tubes for transporting liquid fertilizer have been produced, increasing work efficiency by three to five times compared to carrying by shoulder.

Not long ago, the spring flower field operation tools of the Deqing Commune were still "seven-inch hoes with two upturned corners, and carrying hundreds of pounds of fertilizer by shoulder." However, after more than twenty days, the situation is very different. Walking into the fields, you can see male and female commune members pulling "fertilizer transport vehicles" that can carry 600 to 800 pounds at a time, running fast in the fields; commune members who are cultivating and weeding no longer use those clumsy and heavy "moon axe" hoes, but instead use small and exquisite "small scrapers" and "hollow scrapers" to work lightly. One person can cultivate one and a half to two mu per day, which is twice as efficient as using old hoes, and the quality is good and people are not tired; even more eye-catching is the "ox-drawn ditching plow," which allows one person and one ox to dig 45 to 50 mu of ditches a day, increasing work efficiency by dozens of times.

The reform of field management tools is a new requirement put forward in the continuous leap forward of agricultural production. This year, the planting density of more than 24,000 mu of spring flower crops in the commune has greatly increased, with a ridge width of eight chi and a ditch width of six or seven cun, and old-fashioned field management operation tools are no longer suitable. At that time, the commune arranged for 4,000 laborers to invest in this battle line. However, just as the field management work was unfolding, movements for controlling mountains and rivers, raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, cultivating mulberry gardens, and improving soil also set off a high tide, requiring a large amount of labor to be invested. The commune's nearly 7,000 laborers were simply not enough to allocate.

How to solve this contradiction? After research, the commune party committee decided to take the road of tool innovation and put forward the slogan "Innovate Tools, Skillfully Manage Spring Flowers." Dai Zhaoli and Yao Xiaomao, deputy secretaries of the commune party committee, took technicians from the commune farm tool factory to the Rihuiqiao production team to study the reform of spring flower tools with production team cadres and commune members, and held a three-way combination meeting of leaders, technicians, and commune members in the field. At the meeting, production team cadres and commune members put forward needs, and farm tool factory workers brainstormed with everyone. Everyone was in high spirits and full of enthusiasm. After the meeting, technician Liu Daoming immediately made an "improved shovel" that was 36 centimeters long and 10 centimeters wide, suitable for use in narrow ditches of four or five cun. Old blacksmith Hu Weitong recalled the "hollow hoe" he had made when he was a blacksmith in Nanjing twenty years ago, and also made a "hollow scraper" weighing less than half a jin. When cutting spring flowers, the soil would automatically pop into the empty space, so there was no need to lift and drop the hoe one by one, just scrape it in long strips. Production team members and carpenters made "water and fertilizer transport vehicles" based on the style of bamboo double-wheeled vehicles for transporting bamboo and wooden bucket vehicles for transporting water in Huzhou City. In this way, one idea and one plan, workers and farmers promoted each other, and a total of twenty-two improved tools and new tools were created and imitated. On this basis, Xie Shihong, secretary of the commune party committee, and other comrades led technicians, cadres, and commune members to conduct on-site experiments in the fields, ask commune members to use them and make suggestions, and constantly improve them. As a result of the identification, the thirteen types that are now commonly used were retained.

Breaking through the creation barrier, the promotion barrier came next. The commune party committee first concentrated its efforts on promoting new tools in the Rihuiqiao production team. The vast majority of cadres and commune members welcomed the new tools, but a few people did not believe in the role of the new tools. Some people said: "The peasant family heirloom is carrying fertilizer by shoulder." In order to solve these ideological problems and further improve the understanding of the majority of commune members, the commune party committee and the production team branch organized a competition between new and old tools. On one side were four women led by communist party member Chen Yinnv, using new tools such as "small scrapers," "hollow scrapers," and "two-dragon hoes"; on the other side were four burly men such as Pan Wuqing, using old tools such as "moon axes" and "wide-board hoes." The results of the competition: the new tools can cultivate and loosen 1.5 to 2 mu per day, the loosening is very fine, it can be used in sunny and rainy weather, the seedlings are not damaged, and there are no weeds left in the rows; the old tools can only loosen 6 to 8 fen of soil per day, and damage 1.2% of the seedlings. More than 300 cadres and commune members who visited the site summarized the advantages of the new tools on the spot: high work efficiency, good quality, light and flexible and labor-saving, suitable for dense planting without damaging seedlings, cheap and beautiful and material-saving. In this way, a lively scene of everyone vying to use new tools quickly appeared in the whole team, and more than 320 pieces were promoted in less than five days.

The fact that the Rihuiqiao production team used new tools to cultivate spring flowers with high efficiency and good quality attracted the cadres and commune members of all production teams in the commune. The commune party committee held four on-site meetings in this team, with more than 600 party members, cadres, and commune members participating. Each on-site meeting adopted methods such as watching (on-site visits), doing (actual use), comparing (comparing new and old tools), and calculating (calculating benefits) to let the facts speak for themselves. For example, the Rihuiqiao team calculated two accounts: Before the tool reform, the progress of the second cultivation of more than 1,300 mu of spring flowers in the whole team was the second to last in the brigade and was criticized; a few days after the tool reform, it became the second in the whole brigade. Another account is: on December 19, 1959 (before the tool reform), the whole team dispatched more than 120 laborers, and less than 50 mu of spring flowers were cultivated; on a day in early January this year (after the tool reform), the whole team only dispatched 74 laborers, cultivated 76 mu of spring flowers, and also applied fertilizer to more than 20 mu. These two accounts greatly liberated people's thinking. Cadres and commune members of each production team consciously proposed to learn from Rihuiqiao and do a good job in tool innovation.

Now, there are already four production teams in the whole commune that have achieved the goal of everyone using new tools, fifteen production teams have generally used them, and the remaining production teams are rushing to make them in large quantities, making and using them at the same time. At present, a total of 2,700 people are involved in spring flower cultivation in the whole commune, 1,300 fewer than planned, and more than 24,000 mu of spring flower crops have generally entered the fourth fertilization and cultivation, with an average of 22.9 dan of standard fertilizer applied per mu.

This newspaper reported that the Party organizations at all levels in Ye County, Henan Province, mobilized the people of the county and organized iron, wood, and stone craftsmen to vigorously innovate wheat field management tools.

Ye County planted more than 980,000 mu of wheat this year, all of which implemented rational close planting, and the area of garden-style fields reached more than 80%. With the great changes in sowing methods, the original wide hoes, harrows, and long rollers for field management were no longer suitable. In order to solve this problem, the county party committee adopted the method of launching a mass movement and put forward the slogan "Adapt to the new situation, one plan per person, one tool for three people, and one machine for five people." The county dispatched 3,896 blacksmiths, carpenters, and stonemasons, and after 25 days of on-site investigation and experimentation, more than 260,000 old tools have been modified and new tools for field management have been created. In terms of cultivation tools, there are more than a dozen types of narrow hoes, dual-purpose hoes, animal-powered cultivating hoes, weeding hoes, universal hoes, and short harrows; there are more than a dozen types of land rolling tools such as short rollers and universal rollers. These tools are simple to manufacture, low in cost, high in efficiency, easy to use, and suitable for the characteristics of wheat garden-style fields.

In order to set off a mass movement to reform tools, a great debate was first launched throughout the county to debate how to adapt to the new situation of wheat field management? What to do if there are no raw materials and no technology? Is it better to do it on a large scale or on a small scale? Through the debate, people's thinking of daring to think and dare to do was further established. Herdsman Luo Xinsheng created a multi-head hoe, which can hoe 16 or 17 mu of land per person per day, several times more efficient than using old tools, and guaranteed the quality. In order to overcome technical difficulties, each commune and brigade adopted the method of relying on the masses and relying on commune-run industry, setting off a wave of "everyone contributing ideas and factories making tools."

In the tool reform, each commune and brigade adopted the method of creating, identifying, promoting, and using at the same time, so as to be both fast and good. Among the more than 30 kinds of tools reformed and created in the county, more than 20 kinds have been identified and promoted by the county party committee, and the effectiveness has greatly exceeded that of the old-fashioned tools. For example, the universal hoe is very suitable for use in garden-style densely planted fields. It can hoe, harrow, loosen soil, roll land, and irrigate. One person and one animal can complete several processes at once, which is more than 30 times more efficient than using old-fashioned tools.

    革新工具　巧管夏田
    吴兴县埭溪公社培育春花人数减少工效提高
    叶县大改工具提高小麦田间管理质量
    据浙江日报报道　吴兴县埭溪人民公社在春花田间管理运动中，发动群众大胆创造和改良工具。从去年12月下旬以来，在不到一个月的时间里，全社已创造、仿制和改良了运肥、施肥、撬沟、中耕等环节上的新工具十三种，已经推广了二千一百多件。最近，又制成了运肥的毛竹轨道和运液体肥料的自流竹筒，工效比肩挑人抬提高三倍到五倍。
    不久以前，埭溪公社的春花田间操作工具还是“七寸锄头两角翘，百斤肥担凭肩挑”。可是，经过二十多天，情况就大不相同了。走到田间，只见男女社员拉着一次能运六百斤到八百斤的“运肥车”在田野里飞跑；正在中耕除草的社员，不再用那些又笨又重的“月亮斧”锄头，而是拿着小巧玲珑的“小刮子”和“空心刮”轻快地劳动，一人一天能中耕一亩半到二亩，比用老锄头提高工效一倍，质量又好，人也不累；更引人注目的是“牛拉开沟犁”，一人一牛一天能撬沟四十五亩到五十亩，工效提高了几十倍。
    田间管理工具改革，是农业生产继续跃进中提出来的新要求。今年全社二万四千多亩春花作物的密植程度大大提高，畦宽八尺，沟狭六、七寸，老式的田间管理操作工具不能适应了。当时，全社安排了四千劳动力投入这条战线。但是，田间管理工作刚刚展开，治山治水、养猪积肥、培育桑园和改良土壤等运动也掀起了高潮，要求大量投放劳动力，全社近七千名劳动力根本不够支配。
    怎样解决这个矛盾？公社党委研究以后，决定走工具革新的道路，提出了“革新工具、巧管春花”的口号。公社党委副书记戴兆利、姚小毛带了公社农具厂的技工到日辉桥生产队，和生产队干部、社员一起研究春花工具改革，在田头召开领导、技工和社员参加的三结合会议。会上，生产队干部、社员提出需要，农具厂工人和大家一起想办法，大家情绪很高，干劲十足。会后，技工刘道明连夜动手打了一把长三十六厘米、阔十厘米适合在四、五寸的狭沟里使用的“改良铲”。老铁工胡维通想起了二十年前在南京打铁时打过的“空心锄”，也打出了不到半斤重的“空心刮”，削春花时泥土会自动往空档里冒，不要一锄一锄起落，只要一长条一长条地刮就行。生产队社员和木工根据运竹的双轮车和湖州市里运水的木桶车的式样，制成了“水肥运输车”。这样，你一计，我一策，工农相互促进，先后共创造和仿造了二十二种改良工具和新式工具。在这个基础上，公社党委书记谢士鸿等同志又带领技工、干部、社员到田头去实地试验，请社员使用、提意见，不断改进。鉴定的结果，留下了现在已普遍使用的十三种。
    突破了创造关，又来了推广关。公社党委首先集中力量在日辉桥生产队推广新工具。绝大部分干部、社员都欢迎新工具，但是，也有少数人不相信新工具的作用。有人说：“农民传家宝，肥担靠肩挑。”为了解决这些思想问题，进一步提高广大社员的认识，公社党委和生产队支部组织了一支新老工具比巧大会。一边是以共产党员陈银囡为首的四个妇女，用的是“小刮子”、“空心刮”和“二龙锄”等新工具；一边是潘五庆等四条彪形大汉，用的是“月亮斧”、“阔板锄”等老工具。比赛结果：新工具一天能中耕松土一亩五分至二亩，松土很细，晴雨能用，苗无损伤，行无漏草；老工具一天只能松土六分到八分，伤苗1．2％。到现场参观的三百多名干部、社员，当场总结了新工具的好处：工效高，质量好，轻便灵巧省力气，适合密植不伤苗，价廉物美又省料。这样，全队很快就出现了一个人人争用新工具的热烈场面，不到五天，推广了三百二十多件。
    日辉桥生产队使用新工具培育春花工效高、质量好的事实，吸引了全社各生产队的干部和社员。公社党委在这个队先后召开了四次现场会，有六百多名党员、干部和社员参加。每一次现场会，都采取看（现场参观）、干（实际使用）、比（新老工具对比）、算（算算好处）等方法，让事实说话。例如日辉桥队算了这样两笔账：在改革工具前，全队一千三百多亩春花第二遍培育进度是大队里倒数第二位，受了批评；工具改革几天以后，成为全大队的第二位。另一笔账是：1959年12月19日（工具改革前），全队出动了一百二十多个劳动力，培育的春花不到五十亩；今年1月初的一天（工具改革后），全队只出动了七十四个劳动力，培育春花七十六亩，还施了二十多亩肥料。这两笔账使人们大大解放了思想。各个生产队干部、社员自觉提出要向日辉桥学习，搞好工具革新。
    现在，全公社已经有四个生产队做到人人使用新工具，有十五个生产队已普遍使用，其余各个生产队正在大量赶制，边制边用。目前，全社投入春花培育的共二千七百人，比计划数减少一千三百人，二万四千多亩春花作物已普遍进入第四次施肥培育，平均每亩施好标准肥二十二点九担。
    本报讯　河南叶县各级党组织发动全县人民，组织铁、木、石三匠，大力革新麦田管理工具。
    叶县今年共种小麦九十八万多亩，全部实行了合理密植，园田化面积达到80％以上。随着播种方法的大改变，原来的宽锄、耙、长碾等田间管理工具都不适用了。为了解决这个问题，县委采用大搞群众运动的方法，提出“适应新形势，一人一条计，三人一工具，五人一机器”的口号。全县出动三千八百九十六名铁匠、木匠、石匠，经过二十五天的实地考察和试验，已改旧工具和创造田间管理新工具二十六万多件。中耕方面的工具，有窄锄、两用锄、畜力耘锄、剔草锄、万能锄、短耙等十几种；碾地的工具有短碾万能碾等十多种。这些工具制造简单、成本低、工效高，使用轻便、适合小麦园田化的特点。
    为了掀起改革工具的群众运动，在全县范围内，首先开展了大鸣大放大辩论，辩论如何才能适应麦田管理的新形势？没原料、没技术怎么办？大干好还是小干好等问题。通过辩论，进一步树立了人们敢想敢干的思想。饲养员罗新生创造了多头锄，每人每天能锄地十六、七亩，比用老工具提高了几倍，并且保证了质量。各公社、大队，为了克服技术上的困难，都采取了依靠群众、依靠社办工业的办法，掀起了“人人献计策，厂厂造工具”的热潮。
    在工具改革中，各公社、大队都采用了边创造、边鉴定、边推广、边使用的办法，作到既快又好。全县在改制创造的三十多种工具当中，经县委鉴定推广了二十多种，效能都大大超过了旧式工具。如万能锄很适合园田化密植田使用，能锄地、能耙地、能松土、能碾地、能?地，一人一头牲口，把几道工序一次做完，比用旧式工具提高工效三十多倍。
