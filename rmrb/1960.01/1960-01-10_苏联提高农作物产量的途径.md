Ways to Increase Crop Yields in the Soviet Union
By Aoslikefuovskaya, Soviet Agronomist, Deputy Doctor of Economics

The recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow discussed the further development of agriculture. The participants focused their attention on the summary of the first year of the Seven-Year Plan and the future prospects for agricultural development.

Expanding the production of agricultural products will rely partly on expanding the sown area in Siberia, Kazakhstan, and other regions, but the main method is to rely on better utilization of land and increasing yield per unit area.

Under modern conditions, agricultural production, in terms of mechanization and the rapid increase in the application of chemistry, has generated many new theoretical and practical problems. Careful study of the nature of cultivated land and effective inspection of soil fertility are essential. For example, with the help of scientific research institutions, Ukraine has organized soil surveys, compiled soil maps, and formulated recommendations for each collective farm and state farm to better utilize the land. This work has already been carried out in three-quarters of the collective farms and state farms and will be completed in all regions by 1961. Scientists and experts in Belarus are also doing this work.

In the current situation of large-scale agricultural enterprises such as state farms and collective farms in the Soviet Union, in order to implement scientific management, rational specialization, and the best crop rotation system, and to select the crops with the highest yields, it is first necessary to comprehensively study the nature of the land used.

In large-scale, highly mechanized farms, the implementation of a scientific management system is closely related to the comprehensive mechanization of field crops and animal husbandry. In the Russian Federal Republic, it is stipulated that every collective farm and state farm must formulate comprehensive agronomic, economic, and organizational measures in 1960 to achieve advanced management methods. The basis of this work is the so-called "process specification map." That is to say, in order to fully mechanize the production process of cultivating each crop, and to fully mechanize the operation process of each economic sector and each ranch, it is specifically stipulated from a scientific and practical point of view how many tractors and other complete sets of machines are needed.

Many reports at the plenary session mentioned the use of organic and chemical fertilizers, such as mining local minerals such as apatite, phosphate rock, or limestone with simple machinery and equipment. A lot of work has also been done in accumulating and better utilizing organic fertilizers, and the potential in this area is infinite. In the Russian Federal Republic, the amount of organic fertilizer accumulated and purchased annually reaches 350 million to 400 million tons, including 120 million tons of peat. The value of such a quantity of organic fertilizer is equivalent to 14 million tons of chemical fertilizer. Two hundred million tons of organic fertilizer can also be accumulated in Ukrainian agriculture in a year.

How to achieve stable and high yields was also the subject of discussion at the plenary session. On this issue, everyone attached great importance to selecting high-yield crops and replacing lower-yield crops with them. First of all, it should be pointed out that the planting area of ​​corn is expanded and its harvest is increased.

By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the corn planting area of collective farms and state farms in the Russian Federal Republic will be expanded to 20 million hectares, which is 7 million hectares more than originally planned in the Seven-Year Plan. The corn planting area in Ukraine accounts for 7.7 million hectares. In recent years, they will strive to reach 9 million to 10 million hectares. It accounts for more than half of the grain planting area. Republics such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Azerbaijan are also expanding the planting area of ​​this excellent crop.

Many reports at the plenary session emphasized the great significance of seed cultivation, and the task in this area is to complete the transition to all sowing of improved varieties in the shortest possible time. For example, grain crops in Ukraine have all been sown with improved varieties, and the grain crop seeds developed by Ukrainian breeders have also been widely disseminated. These varieties are particularly suitable for baking bread, and the yield per unit area is also large.

In the reports of the leaders of the Communist Parties of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, the growth of all crops and the increase in the harvest of valuable industrial crops such as cotton were clearly depicted. Technological progress and comprehensive mechanization are necessary conditions for completing the Seven-Year Plan for cotton production ahead of schedule. Since machines replaced all heavy labor, the square-hole planting method was adopted, and machine cultivation replaced weeding with hoes, cotton planters in Uzbekistan reduced the labor spent in 1959 to a quarter or a fifth of that spent during ordinary sowing. This example profoundly illustrates the outstanding role of machines in socialist agriculture. In 1960, the area of ​​cotton cultivated by machines in the Uzbek Republic will account for 90% of the total planting area, and one million hectares of land will not be cultivated with hoes. In 1961, the heavy, hand-made cotton planting tool—the hoe—will be completely replaced by machines.

All speeches at the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee also emphasized the superiority of selling machines to collective farms. Machine drivers play a very important role in Soviet agriculture. Therefore, this plenary session attached great importance to further strengthening the training of mechanics, improving their proficiency, and sending skilled engineers from the cities to the countryside.

In short, all reports and speeches at this plenary session were permeated with the desire to transfer agricultural production to the track of technological progress, so that Soviet agriculture develops along the track paved by modern scientific achievements.

    苏联提高农作物产量的途径
    苏联农学家、经济学副博士　奥斯里科夫斯卡娅
    不久前在莫斯科召开的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议，讨论了进一步发展农业的问题。会议的参加者都把注意力集中在七年计划第一年的总结和今后农业发展的远景计划上面。
    扩大农产品产量，一部分将依靠在西伯利亚、哈萨克斯坦和其它一些地区扩大播种面积，但主要的办法是依靠更好地利用土地，提高单位面积产量。
    现代条件下的农业生产，在机械化和迅速增加对化学的应用方面，产生了许多新的理论问题和实际问题。仔细研究耕地的性质，对土壤的肥沃程度进行有效的检查，已是十分必要了。例如，乌克兰在科学研究机关的帮助下，组织了土壤调查，编制了土壤图，为每一个集体农庄和国营农场更好地利用土地而制订了推荐书。这样的工作已经在四分之三的集体农庄和国营农场进行，到1961年将要在全部地区完成。白俄罗斯的科学家和专家也在做这项工作。
    在目前苏联的国营农场和集体农庄这样的大型农业企业的情况下，要实行科学的经营、合理的专业化，实行最好的轮种制和选择产量最高的作物，首先必须全面研究所使用的土地的性质。
    在大规模高度机械化的农庄，采取科学的经营制度同农田作物和畜牧业的综合机械化有着密切的联系。在俄罗斯联邦共和国，规定每一个集体农庄和国营农场在1960年都要制定出农艺的、经济的和组织上的综合措施，以实现进步的经营方式。这种工作的基础就是所谓“工艺规程图”。这就是说，为了使耕种每一种作物的生产过程，使每一个经济部门、每一所牧场的操作过程全盘机械化，从科学和实际工作方面具体地规定需要多少拖拉机和其他成套机器。
    在全会上的许多报告中都提到使用有机肥料和化学肥料的问题，例如谈到用简单的机器设备开采本地的矿藏，如磷灰土、磷粉或石灰石等。在积存和更好地利用有机肥料方面也作了很多工作，在这方面的潜力是无穷尽的。在俄罗斯联邦共和国，每年积存和采购的有机肥料达到三亿五千万吨到四亿吨，其中有一亿二千万吨泥炭。这样数量的有机肥料的价值等于一千四百万吨化肥。在乌克兰农业中一年也可以积存二亿吨有机肥料。
    如何达到稳定的高产，也是全会讨论的对象。在这个问题上，大家很重视选择高产作物和以之代替产量较低的作物。首先应当指出的是扩大玉蜀黍的播种面积和提高它的收获量。
    七年计划结束时，俄罗斯联邦共和国的集体农庄和国营农场的玉蜀黍播种面积将扩大到二千万公顷，这比七年计划原来规定的数字要多七百万公顷。乌克兰的玉蜀黍播种面积占七百七十万公顷。在最近几年内他们将努力达到九百万至一千万公顷。它在谷物播种面积中占的比重达一半以上。在哈萨克、乌兹别克、塔吉克和阿塞拜疆等共和国也在扩大这种优良作物的播种面积。
    在全会上的许多报告里都强调了种籽种植业的巨大意义，这方面的任务是必需在最短时期内完成过渡到全部播种良种。例如，乌克兰的谷类作物已经全部用良种播种了，同时乌克兰选种学家研究出的谷类作物种子也获得了广泛的传播。这些品种特别适于烤制面包，而且单位面积产量也大。
    在乌兹别克斯坦和塔吉克斯坦共产党的领导者的报告中，清楚地描绘了全部农作物的增长和像棉花这样珍贵的技术作物收获量的增长情况。是技术进步和综合机械化提前完成棉产量方面的七年计划的必要条件。由于用机器代替了全部繁重的劳动、采用正方形穴播法和用机器耕作代替了月锄以后，乌兹别克斯坦的植棉者已在1959年比普通播种时花费的劳动减少到四分之一或五分之一。这个例子非常深刻地说明了机器在社会主义农业中的卓越作用。1960年乌兹别克共和国用机器耕种棉花的面积将占全部播种面积的90％，在一百万公顷土地上不用月锄耕种。1961年笨重的手制播种棉花的农具——月锄就将完全由机器取而代之。
    在苏共中央全会上所有的发言中还强调了把机器卖给集体农庄的优越性。机器驾驶者在苏联农业中起着很重要的作用。因此，这次全会非常重视进一步加强培养机械师，提高他们的熟练程度，并要城市里熟练的工程师到农村去。
    总之，这次全会的所有报告和发言都贯串着把农业生产转到技术进步的轨道上去的热望，使苏联农业沿着现代科学成就所铺设的轨道发展。  （苏联大使馆新闻处供稿）
