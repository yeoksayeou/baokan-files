Respected Comrade Zhou Enlai, dear comrades and friends, ladies and gentlemen:

    The visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of China is coming to an end. I can sincerely tell you that this farewell makes us feel very reluctant to part. The many sincere meetings with representatives of all strata of the brotherly Chinese people have left us with indelible impressions. Whether it was our conversations with workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company or with farmers of the Zhengzhou People's Commune; whether it was our conversations with scientists and artists in Beijing or with the working people of Shanghai, everywhere we were convinced of the epoch-making achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction, we felt this enthusiasm, and we admired the creative power of the Chinese people striving to realize the Party's General Line. We have seen with our own eyes what the "Great Leap Forward" means in the lives of the Chinese people; how the "Great Leap Forward Movement" dominates and strengthens the will and action of 700 million people; how the slogans put forward by the Chinese Communist Party grasp the masses in urban and rural areas and inspire them to make great deeds in socialist construction. This is our strongest and most profound experience.

    In the ten years since the victory of the revolution, under the leadership of its fighting Marxist-Leninist party, the Chinese people have fundamentally changed their country, transforming a backward country into a modern industrial nation. These great achievements have made outstanding contributions to strengthening the socialist camp and have greatly contributed to the change in the balance of world power in favor of the forces of peace and progress.

    The talks that our delegation had with Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai, and Comrade Foreign Minister Chen Yi were conducted in a friendly and fraternal spirit. In the talks, both sides exchanged views on international issues, the situations in Germany and China, and on expanding and deepening the friendly relations between our two countries. It can be confirmed that both sides have reached a complete consensus on all issues discussed.

    As a result of the talks between our delegation and the Government of the People's Republic of China, a long-term trade agreement for 1960-1962 and a treaty of commerce and navigation were signed. This adds two more significant agreements to the treaty relations between the two countries. These two agreements will guarantee the continuous expansion of fraternal cooperation.

    Dear friends and comrades! Contrary to the general trend of relaxation in the international situation, West Germany is currently promoting revanchism, implementing atomic armament, and inciting racial hatred. This is an integral part of the policy of German imperialism and militarism to prepare ideologically for the oppression and domination of other nations whom German imperialists regard as "inferior races." The forces that have twice dragged the peoples of all countries into devastating wars are pursuing the aforementioned policy. The root of racial hatred emanating from West Germany and West Berlin is their imperialist spirit of dominating other countries, especially the peoples of Asia and Africa. This racial hatred serves to prepare and implement the aggressive plans of German imperialism.

    West Berlin plays a special role in this policy of German imperialism. Adenauer's appearance in West Berlin not long ago was a serious provocation to the upcoming summit meeting. As everyone knows, this meeting will also discuss the West Berlin issue. Adenauer's unprecedented provocation against the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp aims to prevent the relaxation of the international situation and to obstruct the positive solution of issues such as disarmament, the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two Germanys, and the establishment of a demilitarized free city of West Berlin. This provocation is directly aimed at the efforts of the peoples of all countries to strive for peace.

    Due to this development of the situation in West Germany and West Berlin, the first German state of peace, namely the German Democratic Republic, has assumed a special task and responsibility. Our country's Seven-Year Plan is a plan for peace, prosperity, and happiness, and it is of decisive significance in preventing the aggressive attempts of German imperialism. By realizing this plan, we will achieve the victory of socialism in the industry and agriculture of the German Democratic Republic, thereby proving that the socialist system of the German Democratic Republic is superior to the capitalist system of West Germany. We will create economic and political conditions for the working people and bourgeois nationalists of West Germany so that they can find a way to implement a policy of peace and transform West Germany into a peaceful, democratic German state.

     In the struggle to safeguard peace in Europe, the German Democratic Republic has received effective support from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all other socialist countries. The Soviet Union's bold and great proposal for complete and thorough disarmament has been fully supported by the government and people of the German Democratic Republic. The Soviet government's action of continuing to reduce its army by 1.2 million troops proves that its policy of peace serves the overall relaxation of the international situation and world peace. The government of the German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving forces in Germany sincerely welcome this new manifestation of the Soviet Union's love of peace, which contributes to creating a good atmosphere for the upcoming summit meeting. Now, the peoples of all countries are expecting the Western countries to take similar measures as well, if the Western countries are willing to seriously contribute to solving international disputes.

    Contrary to the efforts of peace-loving countries to further strive for the relaxation of the international situation and to ensure security, the development of Japan is also very dangerous. The military treaty that the United States and the reactionary Kishi Nobusuke government are about to conclude under the guise of revising the Security Treaty will allow Japanese militarists to freely rearm. Its spearhead is directed against the security of the peoples of Asia and the Far East, and it is also a blow to disarmament and the relaxation of the international situation. The German Democratic Republic most strongly condemns this measure, which is directed against the interests of the People's Republic of China, other socialist countries, and the interests of the peoples of all countries, including the Japanese people. It fully supports the firm attitude taken by the Government of the People's Republic of China against this act that endangers peace.

    These instances of imperialism pursuing extremely dangerous policies require all forces for peace, especially the countries of the socialist camp, to tirelessly continue to work with greater strength, and not allow the world to be dragged into a new and disastrous war.

    I am deeply convinced that our great cause of safeguarding peace will surely succeed.

    I ask you, dear comrades and friends, to join me in raising a glass,

    For the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is constantly achieving new successes in socialist and communist construction and in the struggle to safeguard world peace,

    For the unbreakable friendship between the people of the German Democratic Republic and the great Chinese people, who are victoriously building socialism under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist parties, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Communist Party of China,

    For the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, wishing them good health and energy for the happiness of the Chinese people,

    To the health of all the comrades and friends present, cheers!

### 在德意志民主共和国大使馆宴会上  海因里希·劳副总理的讲话

    在德意志民主共和国大使馆宴会上
    海因里希·劳副总理的讲话敬爱的周恩来同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们，女士们，先生们：
    德意志民主共和国政府代表团在中华人民共和国的访问就要结束了。我可以真诚地告诉你们，这次告别使我们感到十分依依不舍。同兄弟的中国人民各阶层代表的多次诚恳的会见，给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象。不论是我们同武汉钢铁公司工人或者同郑州人民公社农民的谈话；不论是我们同北京的科学家和艺术家或者同上海劳动人民的谈话，到处都使我们信服中国人民在社会主义建设中的划时代的成就，我们感受到了这种热情，并且对中国人民努力实现党的总路线的创造力量感到钦佩。我们亲眼看到了，中国人民生活中的“跃进”意味着什么；“跃进运动”怎样支配和加强七亿人民的意志和行动；中国共产党提出的口号怎样掌握着城乡群众，并且鼓舞他们在社会主义建设中作出伟大的事迹。这是我们最强烈，印象最深刻的体验。
    中国人民在革命胜利后的十年里，在它的战斗的马克思列宁主义政党领导之下，从根本上改变了自己的国家，把一个落后的国家发展成为一个现代化的工业国家。这些伟大的成就对增强社会主义阵营的力量作出了卓越的贡献，并且大大有助于世界力量的对比朝着有利于和平和进步力量的方向变化。
    我们代表团同中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志、中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志、周恩来总理同志以及同外交部长陈毅同志所作的谈话，都是以友好和兄弟般的精神进行的。双方在谈话中就国际问题、德国和中国的形势以及就扩大和加深我们两国之间友好关系的问题交换了意见。可以确认，双方对所讨论的一切问题都取得了完全一致的看法。
    我们代表团同中华人民共和国政府会谈的结果，签订了一项1960年—1962年的长期贸易协定和一项通商航海条约。这使得两国之间的条约关系又增加了两个意义重大的协定。这两个协定将保证不断扩大兄弟般的合作。
    亲爱的朋友们和同志们！和国际局势走向缓和的总的趋势相反，西德目前却在宣传复仇主义、实行原子武装和煽动种族仇视。这是德国帝国主义和军国主义从思想上准备压迫和统治被德国帝国主义者视作“劣等种族”的其他民族政策的组成部分。曾经两次将各国人民拖入毁灭性战争的势力，正在推行上述政策。产生西德和西柏林进行种族仇视的根源是他们主宰其他各国人民尤其是亚洲和非洲人民的帝国主义精神。这种种族仇视是为德国帝国主义准备和实现他们的侵略计划服务的。
    西柏林在德国帝国主义的这项政策中扮演着特别的角色。不久以前阿登纳在西柏林的出现，是对即将到来的最高级会议一次严重的挑衅。大家知道，这次会议也将讨论西柏林问题。阿登纳对于苏联和整个社会主义阵营前所未有的挑衅，目的在于企图阻止国际局势的和缓，阻挠裁军、同两个德国缔结和约以及建立非军事化的自由西柏林城市等问题的积极解决。这种挑衅是直接针对着各国人民争取和平的努力的。
    由于西德和西柏林形势的这种发展，使第一个德意志和平国家、即德意志民主共和国担负起一种特殊的任务和责任。我国的七年计划是一个和平、繁荣和幸福的计划，它对于阻止德国帝国主义的侵略企图具有决定性的意义。实现这一计划，我们就将使社会主义在德意志民主共和国的工业和农业中取得胜利，从而证明德意志民主共和国的社会主义制度比西德的资本主义制度优越。我们将为西德劳动人民和资产阶级民族主义者创造经济和政治条件，以便他们找到一条执行和平政策和使西德变为一个和平、民主的德意志国家的道路。
      在保障欧洲和平的斗争中，德意志民主共和国得到了苏联、中华人民共和国和所有其他社会主义国家的有效的支持。苏联关于全面彻底裁军的大胆而伟大的建议，得到了德意志民主共和国政府和人民的全力支持。苏联政府以继续裁减一百二十万军队的行动证明，它的和平政策是为国际局势的普遍缓和和世界和平服务的。德意志民主共和国政府和德国一切爱好和平的力量衷心欢迎苏联这一热爱和平、并且有助于为即将举行的最高级会议创造良好气氛的新的表示。现在，各国人民都期待着西方国家也采取相似的措施，如果西方国家愿意认真地为解决国际争端问题作出贡献的话。
    同爱好和平国家进一步争取国际局势和缓和保障安全所作的努力相反，日本的发展也非常危险。美国和反动的岸信介政府以修改安全条约为名即将缔结的军事条约，将使日本军国主义者得以自由地重整军备。它的矛头针对着亚洲和远东各国人民的安全，也是对裁减军备和国际局势和缓的一次打击。德意志民主共和国最强烈地谴责这一矛头针对中华人民共和国、其他社会主义国家和各国人民利益，包括日本人民利益在内的措施。它完全支持中华人民共和国政府针对这种危害和平的行动所采取的坚决态度。
    帝国主义执行极端危险的政策的这些事例要求一切和平力量，特别是社会主义阵营各国，不倦地用更大的力量继续努力，不允许世界被卷入一次新的灾难重重的战争中去。
    我深信，我们维护和平的伟大事业必将成功。
    我请你们，亲爱的同志们和朋友们，同我一起举杯，
    为在社会主义和共产主义建设中和在维护世界和平的斗争中不断取得新的成就的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结一致，
    为在马克思列宁主义的政党、德国统一社会党和中国共产党领导下正在胜利地建设社会主义的德意志民主共和国人民和伟大的中国人民之间牢不可破的友谊，
    为中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志，中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志和中华人民共和国总理周恩来同志的健康，祝他们为了中国人民的幸福身体健康和精力充沛，
    为所有在座的同志们和朋友们的健康，干杯！
