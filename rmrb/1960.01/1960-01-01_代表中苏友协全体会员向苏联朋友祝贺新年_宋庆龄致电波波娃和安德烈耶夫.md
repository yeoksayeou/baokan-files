    Xinhua News Agency, December 31st: Song Qingling, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, sent a telegram on the 29th to Popova, Chairman of the Presidium of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Andreyev, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, to congratulate them on the New Year. The telegram said:

    On the occasion of the New Year 1960, on behalf of all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, I extend to you, and through you, to all members of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, and to the great Soviet people, my heartfelt and warm congratulations.

    1959 was an extraordinary year in the history of our two countries.

    Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and under the radiant illumination of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, the Chinese people have achieved great successes in the cause of socialist construction. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the development of our national economy unfolded a situation of continued leap forward in 1959.

    Under the leadership of the glorious Soviet Communist Party, and inspired by the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the great Soviet people have achieved brilliant successes in realizing the magnificent seven-year plan for building communism.

    Over the past year, the great achievements made by China and the Soviet Union, as well as the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, in economic construction, and all the efforts made to maintain peace, have won the unanimous praise of the entire progressive mankind and have given great encouragement to peace-loving people all over the world.

    Over the past year, the friendly exchanges between the people of China and the Soviet Union have become more frequent, and the Sino-Soviet friendship has been greatly developed. The Soviet Party and government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev came to our country to participate in the grand festival of the Chinese people—the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, bringing the profound friendship of the Soviet people to the Chinese people. This visit will surely help to further consolidate the friendly unity of our two peoples.

    Long live the great, eternal, and unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship, the most reliable guarantee for world peace and human progress!

    一年来，中苏两国以及以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营在经济建设中所取得的伟大成就，以及为维护和平所做出的一切努力，赢得了整个进步人类的同声赞美，给予全世界爱好和平的人们以极大的鼓舞。
    一年来，中苏两国人民的友好往来日益频繁，中苏友谊获得了极大的发展。以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联党政代表团，来我国参加了中国人民伟大的节日——中华人民共和国建国十周年的庆典，给中国人民带来了苏联人民深厚的友情。这次访问，必将有助于我们两国人民友好团结的更加巩固。
    世界和平和人类进步最可靠的保证——伟大的、永恒的、牢不可破的中苏友谊万岁！
