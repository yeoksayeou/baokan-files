Visiting Luo Shengjiao's Home
    Yao Yaping

    The festive season makes one think of relatives all the more. The New Year has arrived, and January 2nd marks the eighth anniversary of the heroic sacrifice of the great internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao. How could the comrades of the reconnaissance company where Luo Shengjiao served not miss their dear comrade and the martyr's family at this time? On the eve of the New Year, the reconnaissance company sent a delegation led by Comrade Wang Changli, a former comrade-in-arms of the martyr, carrying good news, gifts, and dozens of letters of condolence from comrades, traveling thousands of miles to the Liyuan People's Commune in Xinhua County, Hunan, to visit the martyr's parents, younger brother, and younger sister.

    As soon as they entered the door, they saw the family of martyr Luo Shengjiao. The comrades warmly called out: "Dad! Mom! We're back!" "We wish you both good health and happiness in the New Year!" Luo Diekai, the martyr's father, and Luo's mother tightly grasped the comrades' hands, saying excitedly, "Good! You've come!" Little sister Liangxiang and little brother Shengming affectionately took the soldiers' hands, saying, "Brother! It's so nice that you're coming home for the New Year!" Instantly, this glorious home was filled with the laughter of family reunion. The family sat around the glowing coal stove, exchanging warm greetings and chatting about everyday life. Wang Changli told the two elders that, under the guidance of the Party and inspired by Luo Shengjiao's spirit of internationalism, all the comrades in the reconnaissance company had achieved comprehensive and excellent results in their military, political, cultural, and sports studies over the past year. Luo's father and Luo's mother were overjoyed to hear that more than seventy people in the company had been commended for meritorious service and become Five-Good Soldiers, and that the Youth League branch had been named an advanced model. Xu Guicai, an old soldier who was usually not very talkative, also said excitedly, "Dad, Mom, I have been doing the clerical work in the company that Brother Shengjiao used to do for four years. Whenever I encounter difficulties in my work, I think of Brother Shengjiao's spirit of self-sacrifice to save others, which strengthens my courage to overcome difficulties. In these years, I have not made a single mistake in my work and have successfully completed the various tasks assigned by the Party, earning a third-class merit and receiving five awards, and I have honorably joined the Communist Party." When Xu Guicai said that he and other veteran comrades had once again applied for extended service, to always be a good son of the Party like Luo Shengjiao, Luo's father and Luo's mother were moved to tears, saying, "How can we not be happy to have you, such good children nurtured by Chairman Mao!" Yang Zunfu, a soldier and Youth League member born in Xinhua County, also told Luo's father and Luo's mother, "After we fifteen youths from Xinhua County joined the army in 1958, we were assigned to the company where Brother Shengjiao served as soldiers. In the past two years, under the guidance of the Party and inspired by Brother Shengjiao's heroic actions, some of us have joined the Youth League, and some have been commended for meritorious service and have become activists, models, and Five-Good Soldiers." Luo's mother listened to this and lovingly stroked Yang Zunfu's red, round face, praising, "Two years is not a long time, but how fast you have progressed!"

    After listening to the soldiers' words, Luo's father also told them, "Since Shengjiao's sacrifice, the Party and the government have given us extremely high honor and meticulous care. After the establishment of the commune, our whole family, like other commune members, has been living better and better every day, with everything we need for living, eating, wearing, and using, and the children are all studying at school. Commune cadres and members send fish, meat, and firewood every New Year and holiday, showing great concern. Last October, everyone elected me to go to Beijing to participate in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. We can only work harder and listen to Chairman Mao to repay the Party."

    Luo's father and Luo's mother are both over sixty years old, but they are still good at labor. Usually, regardless of whether the weather is hot or cold, rainy or windy, they actively go out to work with the young people. Last year, Xinhua County suffered a severe drought that had not been seen in decades. When the Party called for fighting the drought demon to seize grain from the heavens, Luo's father took the lead, joined the anti-drought army, and competed with the young men in treading water. The Party branch secretary repeatedly advised him to rest, but he refused. He said, "Fighting drought is like fighting a war. At this critical moment of seizing grain from the heavens, how can I be a deserter on the battlefield!" Luo's father's selfless and noble qualities inspired the people, and they finally defeated the drought demon and won a bumper harvest. Last year, Luo's father also planted 4.8 mu of experimental fields with the martyr's and soldiers' families of the brigade. Due to good management, they created a record of an average yield of 2,800 jin per mu. All the families of martyrs and soldiers were rated as Five-Good Commune Members. Luo's mother is an excellent breeder. She gets up early and works late every day to make feed and sweep the pigsty, raising the pigs fat and big. The comrades were deeply moved by the two elders' soaring enthusiasm and earnestly advised them not to tire themselves out. But Luo's father jokingly smiled and said, "Are you worried that I'm old? But I feel younger and younger! I want to build a communist society with everyone and see the paradise on earth."

    After talking for a while, Luo's father said with a smile to the comrades: "Children, don't you miss your home? Come on, I'll take you to see the changes in our big family today." This made everyone very happy. The old man took the hand of the new soldier Wang Qingchang and walked in front, with the other soldiers closely following Luo's father. After walking for a short while, they came to a small earth hill, and what was in front of them was a dark, fertile hilly area. Luo's father excitedly introduced to the comrades like a commentator: "This is the paddy field of our Liyuan Commune. In the past, it was barren yellow soil, and nothing could be harvested. After the commune, it was improved and became so shiny. Last year, we suffered a severe drought, but we have a large population and great strength, so we diverted the river water from several miles away across the hills and mountains. The thick rice ears were like drunkards, nodding and laughing at people. We won a bumper harvest of 1,136 jin per mu." Walking down the small earth slope, suddenly, Yi Guochang pointed to a place in the distance that was smoking and clanging, and asked Luo's father in surprise: "Before I joined the army, weren't there a few thatched huts there? Where did they go?" "The small thatched huts?" Luo's father said, "They have already been burned as firewood. That place has become the commune's farm machinery factory, kerosene factory, fertilizer factory, brick and tile factory, and ten-thousand-head pig farm." Luo's father paused for a moment, and jokingly said to Yi Guochang, "When you finish your three years of military service and come back, I'm afraid you'll need someone to lead you home!" Everyone laughed. Climbing up a small earth hill, standing on Tea Mountain Ridge, a line of flat land in front of the mountain, and between the two valleys behind the mountain, thousands of people were working, countless red flags were flying in the wind, hand carts and earthen trains were running back and forth, and bamboo baskets carrying soil in the high sky glided over their heads like shooting stars. It turned out that a railway was being built in front of the mountain, and a large reservoir was being built behind the mountain. A scene of building a new socialist countryside deeply moved the people. The comrades couldn't wait to go and carry soil immediately, and contribute to the construction of their hometown together with the commune members. Luo's father smiled and said, "It's not easy for you to come here once, so let's take a look more. There will be more opportunities to work in the future." After saying that, he led everyone to walk on the field avenue extending to the south. Luo's father told everyone that the commune's car would run on this road this year. Turning around the small mountain corner, a row of new houses appeared in front of them in a green and lush tangerine forest, with red tiles and white walls, and dazzling glass. This is one of the six new residential points built by the Liyuan Brigade of the commune. Before the Spring Festival, more than 1,500 commune members will become the masters of these beautiful new homes. Luo's father said with joy: "Within three years, our Liyuan Commune will realize the four modernizations, the grain yield per mu will reach 2,810 jin, and we will also build two power stations to realize gardenization and orchardization. After all the new residential points are completed, there will be large auditoriums, clubs, broadcasting stations, cinemas, hospitals, secondary schools, department stores, bookstores, gardens... and become a brightly lit city.

    When it was time to leave their beloved father, mother, and beloved hometown, how reluctant and unwilling the soldiers were! The two elders kindly exhorted them: to always listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, study hard, and exercise. The soldiers said that they would definitely remember the words of the two elders, always maintain the honor of the Luo Shengjiao Company, study better in the new year, improve their skills, defend the socialist construction of the motherland, and defend the happy life of the people.

    探望罗盛教的家
    姚亚萍
    人逢佳节倍思亲。新年到了，元月2日又正是伟大的国际主义战士罗盛教英勇牺牲八周年纪念日，罗盛教生前所在的某部侦察连的同志们，在这时，怎么能不怀念亲爱的战友、不怀念烈士的亲人呢？新年前夕，侦察连派出了由烈士生前战友王昌璃同志组成的慰问组，带着喜报、礼物和同志们写的几十封慰问信，不远千里，来到湖南新化县燎原人民公社探望烈士的双亲和弟弟、妹妹。
    一进门，就看到罗盛教烈士的一家人。同志们亲热的喊着：“爸爸！妈妈！我们回来了！”“祝您二位老人家新年安康、快乐！”烈士的父亲罗迭开和罗妈妈紧紧握住同志们的手，激动的连声说：“好啊！你们来了！”小妹妹亮香和小弟弟盛明，亲热地拉着战士们的手说：“哥哥！你们来家过年真好呀！”顿时，这光荣之家充满了亲人团聚的欢笑声。一家人团团地围坐在红旺的煤火炉旁，互相嘘寒问暖的叙起了家常。王昌璃向二老说，侦察连全体同志在党的教导下，和盛教烈士国际主义精神鼓舞下，一年来在军事、政治、文化、体育等学习方面都取得全面优秀成绩。罗爸爸，罗妈妈听到全连七十多人立功受奖和当上五好战士；团支部又被评为先进标兵时，满面喜色，高兴极了。平时不大爱说话的老战士徐桂财，这时也兴冲冲地说个不停：“爸爸、妈妈，我在连队做的是盛教哥哥生前做的文书工作，已经有四年了。每当我在工作中遇到困难的时候，想起了盛教哥哥舍己救人的精神，就加强了我克服困难的勇气。这几年，我在工作中没有出过一次差错，圆满的完成了党交给的各项工作任务，立了一次三等功，受过五次奖励，并且光荣的参加了共产党。”当徐桂财说到他和其他老同志，再次申请超期服役，永远做一个像罗盛教那样忠于党的好儿子的时候，罗爸爸、罗妈妈感动的擦着热泪说：“有你们这些毛主席教养出来的好孩子，我们怎能不高兴啊！”出生在新化县的战士、共青团员杨尊富也告诉罗爸爸和罗妈妈说：“我们十五个新化县的青年在1958年入伍后，被分配到盛教哥哥生前所在连队当战士，二年来，在党的教导和盛教哥哥英雄行为的激励下，我们有的加入了共青团，有的立了功受了奖，当了积极分子、标兵和五好战士。”罗妈妈听了这话，慈爱地抚摸着杨尊富红圆的脸蛋称赞说：“两年的时间不算长，可是你们的进步多快啊！”
    听了战士们的话，罗爸爸也告诉他们：“自从盛教牺牲后，党和政府给我们极高的荣誉和无微不至的照顾。公社成立后，全家和其他社员一样，生活一天更比一天好起来，住吃穿用样样齐全，孩子们都在学校念书。社里干部和社员，每逢过年过节送来鱼肉柴禾，真是关心备至。去年10月大家又选我上北京参加了建国十年大庆。我们只有更好的劳动，听毛主席的话来报答党。”
    罗爸爸和罗妈妈都是年过六十的人了，可是劳动仍然是把好手。平常，不管天热天冷，下雨刮风，都是积极的和青年们一起出工劳动。去年新化县遭受了几十年未有的大旱灾，当党号召与天争粮战胜旱魔的时候，罗爸爸一马当先，参加了抗旱大军，和小伙子展开了车水竞赛。党支书几次劝他休息，他说啥也不肯。他说：“抗旱就是打仗，在这与天争粮的紧急关头，我怎么能当战场上的逃兵！”罗爸爸这种忘我为公的高贵品质，鼓舞着人们，终于战胜了旱魔，赢得了丰收。去年罗爸爸还和大队的烈、军属种了四点八亩试验田，由于管理得好，创造了平均亩产二千八百斤的纪录。全体烈、军属被评为五好社员。罗妈妈是个优秀的饲养员，她每天起早贪黑做饲料，扫猪圈，把猪养得又肥又大。同志们为两位老人的冲天干劲深受感动，关切地劝慰二老别累着了。可是罗爸爸却打趣地笑着说：“是耽心我老了吗？可我倒觉得越活越年轻咧！我还要和大家一起建设共产主义社会，见到人间的天堂乐园。”
    谈了一阵，罗爸爸笑迷迷地对同志们说：“孩子们，你们不是想家吗？走，我带你们去看看我们今天的大家庭的变化吧。”这一下可把大家乐坏了。老人手拉着新战士王庆昌走在前面，别的战士紧跟在罗爸爸的身旁。走了不多一会，来到小土丘上，展现在面前的是一片黑黝黝肥沃的丘陵地。罗爸爸像一个解说员似的兴奋的向同志们介绍：“这是我们燎原公社的稻田，过去干瘦的黄土质，种啥没啥收，公社化后，经过改良才变成这样油光发亮。去年受了大旱灾，我们人多力量大，把几里远的河水翻丘越岭引了过来，粗大的稻穗像喝醉了酒，向人点头发笑。被我们夺得了亩产一千一百三十六斤的特大丰收。”走下小土坡，忽然，易国长指着远处正在冒烟叮当作响的地方，惊奇地向罗爸爸问道：“我参军前，那里不是有几间茅草屋吗？哪去了？”“小茅草屋吗？”罗爸爸说，“已经当柴火烧啦。那里已经成了公社的农具机械厂、煤油厂、肥料厂、砖瓦厂、万头养猪场的地方了。”罗爸爸停了一下，打趣易国长说：“等你当完三年兵再回来，恐怕要人领路才找得到家咧！”说得大家都哈哈的笑了。上了小土岗，站在茶山岭上，山前一线平地，山后两峪之间，成千上万的人正在劳动，无数的红旗迎风飘扬，手推车、土火车来往奔驰，高空运土竹篮像流星似的从头上滑过。原来山前在修筑铁路，山后在兴建大水库。一片建设社会主义新农村的景象，深深地激动着人们的心。同志们恨不得马上就去担土，和社员们一起为家乡的建设贡献一分力量。罗爸爸笑道：“你们来一次不容易，还是多看看吧，劳动的机会日后还多着哩。”说完又领着大家走在向南延伸的田间大道上。罗爸爸告诉大家，今年这条路上就有公社的汽车跑了。拐过小山角，在前面的一片绿茂的桔子林中，出现了一排排新房舍，红瓦白墙，玻璃耀眼。这是公社燎原大队兴建的六个新居民点中的一个。春节前，一千五百多个社员，就将成为这些漂亮新居的主人了。罗爸爸满怀喜悦的说：“三年内我们燎原公社要实现四化，粮食亩产要达到二千八百一十斤，还要修建两座发电站，实现园田化，果园化。新的居民点全部建成后，那时，这里就要有大礼堂、俱乐部、广播站、电影院、医院、中等学校、百货商店、书店、花园……变成灯火明亮的城市了。
    在离别亲爱的爸爸、妈妈和亲爱的故乡的时候，战士们是多么依恋不舍啊！二位老人亲切地叮嘱他们：要永远听党和毛主席的话，好好学习，锻炼身体。战士们表示，一定记住两位老人的话，永远保持罗盛教连的荣誉，在新的一年里，更好的学习，提高本领，保卫祖国的社会主义建设，保卫人民的幸福生活。
