    Producing Calcium Magnesium Phosphate Fertilizer More and Better
    Zhang Huawen, Director of Hubei Provincial Department of Chemical Industry

    Currently, among chemical products serving agriculture, the greatest need is for chemical fertilizers. Farmers say, "A flower on a crop depends entirely on fertilizer," "What has a mouth needs to eat, what has roots needs fertilizer," "Harvest or no harvest depends on water, big harvest or small harvest depends on fertilizer." These sayings vividly illustrate the importance of fertilizer. Especially in many places, after large-scale water conservancy projects have been built, the need for fertilizer has become even more pressing. Therefore, rapidly developing the chemical fertilizer industry and providing agriculture with large quantities of chemical fertilizers is an arduous and glorious task for the chemical industry sector.
    The development of chemical fertilizers mainly focuses on nitrogen, phosphate, and potash fertilizers. Considering long-term needs and crop requirements, all these types of fertilizers need significant development. However, based on resource characteristics and current conditions, the widespread development of nitrogen fertilizer is somewhat limited by equipment, so it can only be developed as a priority and gradually popularized. Potash fertilizer resources need to be actively identified and developed in a planned and step-by-step manner. Currently, in terms of resources and production equipment, the main effort should be to vigorously develop the phosphate fertilizer industry, especially to greatly promote calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer production through "small-scale indigenous groups" and "small-scale modern groups."
    Do we have the conditions to vigorously promote a mass movement for calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer? The answer is: the conditions are fully available.
    First, phosphate rock resources are exceptionally abundant. According to incomplete statistics in Hubei Province alone, phosphate rock resources have been discovered in more than thirty counties across the province.
    Second, the successful trial production of calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer using small-scale indigenous blast furnaces and eight-cubic-meter iron-smelting blast furnaces using white coal instead of coke has paved a broad road for the mass movement of phosphate fertilizer production. In the past, the reason why calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer could not be universally developed was mainly because coke was required as fuel; and the source of coke was relatively difficult, thus limiting development. Now that the fuel and equipment problems have been solved, favorable conditions have been created for the great development of calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer.
    Third, vigorously developing iron and steel has provided technical experience for developing calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer. Calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer is roughly similar to iron smelting in terms of equipment and technology, making it possible to utilize iron-smelting equipment and leverage a broad mass base.
    From the perspective of need, phosphorus is an indispensable and important element for crops, and readily available, fast-acting phosphorus in the soil is generally scarce. Due to crop harvesting, phosphorus is continuously removed from the soil, requiring continuous replenishment. Phosphate fertilizer can enable crops to mature earlier, develop robustly, enhance drought resistance, cold resistance, and the ability to withstand natural disasters. It can also promote the vigorous reproduction of rhizobia in crops, fix more nitrogen in the air, and enhance soil fertility. In short, it has the effect of making crop grains full, increasing the number of ears and grains, thereby increasing crop yields. Currently, in many countries that use large amounts of chemical fertilizers, the proportion of phosphate fertilizer in chemical fertilizers is the largest. This shows that developing the phosphate fertilizer industry plays an important role in promoting agricultural development.
    The fertilizer effect of calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer is very good, similar to ordinary superphosphate. According to domestic test results, each jin of calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer can increase wheat production by 1.85 to 2.5 jin, rapeseed by 1.14 jin, and rice by about 17% (according to tests by Huazhong Agricultural College, the number of grains per ear alone can increase by about 16%). Calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer is a weakly alkaline fertilizer, especially suitable for acidic and sandy soils. It does not have the effect of acidifying the soil but contains various chemical elements such as phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, and silicon, which have a good effect on crops. It has good physical properties, does not absorb moisture, does not cake, is non-corrosive, and is easy to store.
    The equipment needed to produce calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer with small-scale indigenous blast furnaces is easy to solve, construction is fast, results are great, costs are low, and technology is relatively easy to master, making it most suitable for people's communes to run. To set up a small-scale indigenous blast furnace, the equipment only requires two 1.7 kW centrifugal blowers (or one large blower can be used instead of two) and one small water pump. Without steel and cement, it can be built in one day, and it can produce about 300 tons of calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer a year. After applying these fertilizers, grain production can be increased by about one million jin per year.
    Based on the above, vigorously developing calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer is the most realistic and effective way to increase chemical fertilizer production and support agriculture to continue its leap forward. Based on our experience, to do this work well, attention should be paid to the following points:
      (1) Comprehensive planning and rational layout. Construction should first be based on resources and geographical conditions; the layout should be mainly based on water transportation and supplemented by land transportation. Waterway transportation has low costs. Second, measures should be adapted to local conditions, combining centralized and decentralized approaches. Areas with convenient transportation and good resource conditions should be appropriately centralized and built in groups, which is convenient for management and saves labor. Third, industry and agriculture production should be combined, adapting to the time, combining year-round production and seasonal production; some operate year-round, and some operate seasonally; more work during slack seasons and less work during busy seasons, which is conducive to the flexible arrangement of labor.
      (2) Self-reliance in solving equipment problems. On the one hand, efforts should be made to clean up and utilize the equipment left over from the vigorously developing iron and steel campaign; on the other hand, equipment should be comprehensively utilized. For example, agricultural irrigation and drainage equipment can be utilized on the principle of not affecting irrigation and drainage tasks; under possible conditions, it should be manufactured by oneself or replaced by substitutes.
    (3) Organize raw material production; conduct good exploration and testing and analysis work. This work is very important, and if there is even a slight oversight, it will cause errors and waste.
    (4) Let go of the masses, experiment with everything, and cultivate technical forces. Apply the experience of past mass movements to cultivate typical examples, carry out pilot projects, and use the pilot projects to drive the overall effort; each special zone and county with conditions for widespread promotion of calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer should concentrate efforts to carry out a pilot project at the fastest speed, establish an example, and organize promotion by holding on-site meetings based on the maturity of the pilot project.
    (5) Promote the communist spirit and foster a strong atmosphere of cooperation. Areas with good conditions should support areas with poor conditions, and areas with abundant resources should support areas with scarce resources, supporting each other and sharing what they have. Adopt a variety of different ways to cooperate, with some focusing on raw materials, some focusing on production, and some focusing on transportation.
    The small-scale indigenous groups and small-scale modern groups for calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer are still nascent sprouts, but they have already shown strong vitality, and the prospects for development are limitless and promising. Under the correct leadership of the Party, the mass movement to greatly produce calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer will definitely be rapidly developed.

    又多又好地生产钙镁磷肥
    湖北省化学工业厅厅长　张华文
    当前化工产品为农业服务需要量最大的是化学肥料。农民说：“庄稼一枝花，全靠肥当家”，“长嘴的要吃，长根的要肥”，“有收无收在于水，多收少收在于肥”。这些话是形象地说明了肥料的重要。特别是很多地方经过大规模地兴修水利之后，对肥料的需要更加迫切。因此，迅速地发展化学肥料工业，为农业提供大量的化学肥料，是化学工业部门一项艰巨而光荣的任务。
    发展化学肥料在品种上主要是发展氮肥、磷肥和钾肥，从长远考虑和农作物的需要出发，这几种肥料都需要大大发展。但是，根据资源特点和当前条件，普遍发展氮肥在设备方面还有一定限制，只能重点发展，逐步普及；肥要积极的查清资源，有计划有步骤地发展。目前，就资源和生产设备情况来看，主要应该大力发展磷肥工业，特别是大搞钙镁磷肥“小土群”、“小洋群”。
    我们有没有条件大搞钙镁磷肥的群众运动？回答是：条件完全具备。
    首先是磷矿的资源异常丰富。仅据湖北省不完全统计，全省三十余个县发现有磷矿资源。
    其次是由于以白煤代替焦炭用小土高炉和八立方米炼铁高炉试验生产钙镁磷肥成功，这就为大搞磷肥生产的群众运动铺平了一条康庄大道。过去钙镁磷肥所以不能普遍发展，主要是因为要用焦炭作燃料；而焦炭的来源比较困难，因而发展受到限制。现在解决了燃料和设备问题，这就为钙镁磷肥的大发展创造了良好的条件。
    第三是大办钢铁为发展钙镁磷肥提供了技术经验。钙镁磷肥在设备和技术方面都同炼铁大体相似，既能利用炼铁设备，又有广泛的群众基础。
    从需要方面来看，磷是农作物不可缺少的一种重要元素，土壤里容易为植物所吸收的速效磷一般很少。由于农作物的收割，使得土壤里的磷不断被带走，这就要求不断地加以补充。磷肥能使农作物提早成熟，发育健壮，增强抗旱、耐寒和抵抗自然灾害的能力，并且能使农作物根瘤菌繁殖旺盛，固定空气中更多的氮素，增强土壤的肥力。总之，它具有使农作物籽实饱满，穗粒增多，从而提高农作物产量的功效。现在世界上很多大量使用化学肥料的国家，磷肥的使用量在化学肥料当中的比重最大。由此可见，发展磷肥工业对促进农业发展有着重要的作用。
    钙镁磷肥的肥效很好，与普通过磷酸钙相同，据国内试验结果，每斤钙镁磷肥可以增产小麦一点八五到二点五斤，油菜一点一四斤，水稻17％左右（据华中农学院试验，仅每穗粒数即可增加16％左右）钙镁磷肥是一种弱碱性肥料，特别适用于酸性土壤及砂质土壤。它没有酸化土壤的作用，却含有磷、镁、钙、硅等多种化学元素，对农作物有良好作用；它具有很好的物理性能，不吸潮，不结块，没有腐蚀性，容易存放。
    用小土高炉生产钙镁磷肥需要的设备容易解决，建设快，收效大，花钱少，技术比较容易掌握，最适合人民公社举办。办一个小土高炉，设备只要一点七瓩离心鼓风机两台（或用大的鼓风机一台代替两台使用）和小型水泵一台，不用钢材和水泥，一天即可建成，一年能够生产钙镁磷肥三百吨左右，施用这些肥料以后，每年可增产粮食一百万斤左右。
    根据以上情况，大搞钙镁磷肥是当前增加化肥产量，支援农业继续跃进最现实、最有效的办法。根据我们的体会，做好这项工作，应注意下列几点：
      （1）全面规划，合理布点。首先是根据资源和地理条件进行建设；在布局上应该以水运为主，陆运为辅。利用水路运输成本低。其次是因地制宜，采取集中与分散相结合，交通方便，资源条件好的适当集中，成群建设，既便于管理，又节省劳动力。第三是工农业生产结合，因时制宜，长年生产与季节生产相结合；有的长年生产，有的季节性生产；闲时多搞，忙时少搞，有利于劳动力的灵活安排。
      （2）自力更生解决设备问题。一方面要尽量清理利用大办钢铁遗留下来的设备；另一方面是设备综合利用。如农业排灌设备在不影响排灌任务的原则下加以利用；在可能条件下自己制造或者设法代用。
    （3）组织好原料生产；作好勘探和检验分析工作。这个工作是十分重要的，如果稍有疏忽，那就会造成错误，造成浪费。
    （4）放手发动群众，一切经过试验，培养技术力量。运用以往群众运动的经验培养典型，搞好试点，以点带面；每个专区和有条件普遍推广钙镁磷肥的县都应当集中力量，以最快的速度，搞好一个试点，树立一个榜样，并且在试点成熟的基础上召开现场会议组织推广。
    （5）发扬共产主义风格，大兴协作之风。条件好的地区应该支援条件差的地区，资源多的地区应该支援资源少的地区，互相支援，互通有无。采取多种不同的方式进行协作，有的多搞原料，有的多搞生产，有的多搞运输。
    钙镁磷肥的小土群、小洋群还是初生的萌芽，但它已经显示出强大的生命力，发展前途无量，大有可为。在党的正确领导下，大造钙镁磷肥的群众运动，肯定是会得到迅速发展的。
