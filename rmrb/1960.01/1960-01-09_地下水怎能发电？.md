How Can Groundwater Generate Electricity?

    The People's Daily reported on January 4th that China's first hydropower station using groundwater, the Liulangdong Hydropower Station, has already generated electricity.

    Groundwater is generally stored in the pores inside rocks. When digging wells, we see it always seeping out of the stones. How can it be used to generate electricity?

    It turns out that some rocks, such as limestone, are easily dissolved by groundwater. In areas where this type of rock is distributed, underground areas are often dissolved into many cavities. After these cavities gradually expand and connect, the groundwater stored within them is like a real river or lake, capable of flowing and thus can be used to generate electricity.

    地下水怎能发电？
    一月四日人民日报报道：我国第一座利用地下水发电的六郎洞水电站已经发电。
    地下水一般贮藏在岩石内部的孔隙中，在打井挖泉的时候，我们看到它总是从石头中渗出，怎么能用来发电呢？
    原来有些岩石如石灰岩容易被地下水溶解，在这种岩石分布的地区，地下常被溶成许多空洞，这些空洞逐渐扩大并且连通起来后，地下水贮藏在其中就像真正的河湖一样，可以流动，因此能引来发电。
