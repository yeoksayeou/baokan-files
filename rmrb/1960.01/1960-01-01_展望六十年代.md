The last year of the 1950s (1950-1959), 1959, has passed; the first year of the 1960s (1960-1969), 1960, has begun. A decade is but a moment in human history. However, both in China and the world, the past decade has experienced great and profound changes, and a new decade unfolds before us with boundless light and hope.

The People's Republic of China has just celebrated its tenth anniversary. In this decade, relying on the people's democratic dictatorship with the Communist Party of China as its core of leadership, China completed the unification of the country except for Taiwan, completed the democratic reforms throughout the country (the democratic reforms in Tibet are now proceeding smoothly), and subsequently, on the basis of the complete victory of the democratic reforms, completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and victoriously carried out the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts. The Chinese people spent three years completing the recovery of the national economy damaged by prolonged war; then, starting in 1953, they carried out seven years of planned economic construction. All this has brought about fundamental changes in China's social and political landscape that had not occurred for thousands of years. China's economic and cultural situation, although still relatively backward in comparison, is incomparable to what it was before liberation.

The victory of the Chinese revolution and construction is one of the greatest victories of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union in the world, and one of the greatest victories of Marxism-Leninism in history. China's socialist cause, in all its basic principles, strictly follows the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, faithfully inherits and develops the glorious cause of the October Revolution. At the same time, in many specific steps and forms, it also has its own national and historical characteristics. This is inevitable and natural. The declaration of the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties states: "Marxism-Leninism requires the creative application of the common principles of socialist revolution and socialist construction in accordance with the specific historical conditions of each country, and does not allow the mechanical copying of the policies and tactics of Communist Parties of other countries. Lenin repeatedly warned that the basic principles of communism must be correctly adapted to the special circumstances of nations and national states. A proletarian party that ignores national characteristics will inevitably become divorced from life, divorced from the masses, and will inevitably cause losses to the cause of socialism." In China, a large country with a quarter of the world's population, it is even more unimaginable to apply Marxism-Leninism in revolution and construction without its own characteristics. In the first stage of the past decade, the Chinese Communists and the people of the whole country first devoted themselves to realizing democratic reforms and socialist transformation throughout the country in accordance with China's conditions; only after these two tasks were successfully completed did they concentrate their attention on the new task of developing socialist construction in China's conditions. In the latter task, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Party and the people, based on the experience of recent periods, found three magic weapons: the general line for building socialism, the development speed of the Great Leap Forward, and the organizational form of the People's Commune.

The Party's general line for building socialism, a set of "walking on two legs" policies revolving around this general line, the resulting Great Leap Forward in the national economy, and the People's Communes that emerged to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward, are all new things in the cause of the Chinese people, and new things are always bound to arouse doubts in some people. Are they really correct and effective? Are they really supported by the masses of the people? If the experience of 1958 has not dispelled the doubts of some people, then the experience of 1959 has given these questions a further affirmative answer. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party's call to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule in 1959 has been victoriously realized. The situation of the completion and over-completion of planned targets throughout the country will soon be announced. According to preliminary statistics, the total industrial output value in 1959 greatly exceeded the state's plan, with steel production reaching more than 13 million tons, an increase of more than 5 million tons or more than 60% compared with 1958. Industrial products, both heavy and light industries, have increased in variety, improved in quality, and reduced in cost. Small-scale industries and county and commune industries have entered a stage of consolidation and development and are playing an important role in the national economy. Agricultural production, after overcoming unprecedented major natural disasters, still achieved a greater harvest than in 1958 for the country as a whole. The total agricultural output value significantly exceeded the state's plan. The organization of the People's Communes throughout the country is becoming increasingly sound, its superiority is becoming increasingly apparent, and its prestige among the peasants is increasing day by day. People's incomes have increased, and market supplies have increased accordingly. The people's cultural and educational undertakings have also made rapid progress. In short, both urban and rural areas throughout the country are filled with a thriving atmosphere. According to the American propaganda machine, 1959 was China's "darkest year" and "poorest year." If the so-called "darkest" and "poorest" is such a thing, then let some countries that rely on "US aid" to maintain their rule also have some of this "darkness" and "poverty"! Unfortunately, even if the imperialists are willing to do so, they can never achieve it.

Due to the undoubted victory of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, life in the whole of China is boiling. Such a great productive force of 650 million liberated people is running at full speed towards a fully recognized destination, along a fully recognized route, and adopting fully recognized methods. It is impossible not to do so, because China's economy and culture are too backward, imperialism has been constantly threatening us, even invading our territory, and the backward relations of production and the superstructure that hinder the people's progress have been overthrown, and the people have awakened and are no longer sleeping. These are the people who have taken control of their own destiny, these are the united and organized people, these are the people who have been educated by Marxism-Leninism, who have been educated by the spirit of communism, who have liberated their minds, who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. These people, inspired by the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and mastering the experience of the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, are not only full of determination and confidence for the continued leap forward and better leap forward in 1960, but also full of determination and confidence for the continuous leap forward throughout the entire 1960s. The Chinese people's goal is to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in the new decade, basically establish a complete industrial system, basically realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, and science and culture, and thus build China into a strong socialist country. Of course, even then, China's industrial and agricultural products per capita will still be at a very low level and will still be backward compared with Britain. To completely overcome this backwardness, more time is needed. Precisely because of this, the Chinese people must adhere to the general line, adhere to the Great Leap Forward, and adhere to the People's Commune in order to get rid of backwardness sooner.

The socialist cause of the Chinese people is part of the entire cause of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union and is developed with the generous assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. The Chinese people pay warm attention to the development of the socialist cause and the communist construction cause of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, and constantly receive new encouragement and inspiration from their great victories. From 1950 to 1958, the industrial production of the socialist camp countries increased by about 1.6 times, while that of the capitalist countries increased by only 37%. The total industrial output value of the socialist camp countries in 1958 already accounted for about 40% of the world's total industrial output value. In terms of agriculture, the grain and cotton produced by the socialist camp countries in 1958 already accounted for 43% and 38% of the world's total output, respectively. That is to say, calculated per capita, the average level of industry and agriculture in the socialist world has exceeded the average level of the capitalist world. 1959 was a year of continued rapid progress for socialist countries. The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, held in January and February 1959, declared that the Soviet Union had entered a period of comprehensively unfolding the construction of a communist society, and adopted the unprecedentedly grand control figures for the seven-year (1959-1965) plan for developing the national economy, stipulating that within seven years, it would surpass the most developed capitalist countries in Europe in terms of per capita industrial output, and surpass the current level of the United States in terms of the absolute output of some of the most important products. Now the people of the whole Soviet Union are victoriously struggling to complete this great plan ahead of schedule and ahead of target. The Soviet Union's advanced science and technology achieved particularly great achievements in 1959, successfully launching three cosmic rockets and, for the first time in human history, uncovering the secrets of the far side of the moon. Socialist countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are also actively fighting to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in Europe and Asia in terms of economic development. In all socialist camp countries, a vigorous movement of technological innovation and labor competition has been launched. The fastest-growing capitalist countries cannot keep up with the pace of development of socialist countries in terms of development speed. Therefore, it is entirely foreseeable that in the next decade, the socialist world will inevitably have an overwhelming advantage over the capitalist world in terms of economy.

In contrast to the socialist world, the capitalist world, when looking forward to the 1960s, only feels a bleak future. The past decade has been a decade of stagnation, turmoil, and disintegration in the capitalist world. Since the end of World War II, countries with a total population of about 1.4 billion, including China, have achieved independent status. At present, the number of people still directly under the colonial shackles of imperialism has been reduced to about 160 million. The struggle for national independence, both in time and space, has spread throughout Asia, Africa, Latin America, and even parts of Europe. It is impossible for imperialism to maintain its original colonial system, and it is encountering increasing resistance in carrying out new national aggression. The struggle between imperialist countries is becoming increasingly fierce. At the same time, the workers' movement, the peasant movement, and the struggles of other working people in various countries for democratic freedom and the rights to life have also been further developed. The international situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable to imperialism, first and foremost to US imperialism. The famous assertion of Comrade Mao Zedong in 1957 that "the East wind prevails over the West wind" cannot but be recognized even by many spokespersons of the Western bourgeoisie. Former US Secretary of State Dulles said in a speech in November 1958: "We do live in a veritable whirlwind of changing situations." American political commentator Lippmann wrote: "The astonishing speed of Soviet achievements foretells that Russia is growing not only in military strength, but also in political and economic influence... We are not only lagging behind, but in the current actual situation, we will continue to lag behind in the future." In another article, he said that now "the greatest countries are in Eastern Europe and Asia," and "the Atlantic group is no longer the political center of the world." The past decade has been like this; can the Western bourgeoisie have any magic tricks to reverse the situation in the next decade, in the 1960s when the socialist world is stronger and more dominant?

For a long time, US imperialism has been betting on new wars. The United States' direct military expenditure will remain at around US$41 billion in fiscal year 1960. The United States now has more than one million armed forces stationed in more than 70 countries and regions, 250 overseas military bases, and is stepping up the establishment of missile bases at home and abroad, in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Far East. But war can never change the laws of historical development. Under the current conditions of the world's balance of power, it is a dream for US imperialism to try to save the decline of capitalism by war. As everyone knows, even military superiority does not belong to the West now or in the future. Socialist countries are resolutely opposed to war. Socialist countries advocate easing international tensions, advocate realizing universal disarmament, and advocate peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between countries with different social systems. But socialist countries will never succumb to the war threats of imperialism. If the imperialists insist on imposing war on socialist countries, then the inevitable result can only be the complete elimination of imperialism.

This significant change in the world's balance of power has created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for the struggle of the people of all countries for peace. The socialist camp is the decisive force in the world for maintaining peace. Its unprecedented strength and the victory of its firm and unwavering peaceful foreign policy have greatly encouraged the forces of peace and struck a blow at the forces of war. In the past year, the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union have made a series of major efforts to ease tensions. In particular, the visit of Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to the United States, and the Soviet Union's proposal for a comprehensive and thorough disarmament plan, have been warmly welcomed by the people of the world. In the face of the powerful tide of peace, the United States agreed to convene a summit meeting and also expressed the hope that the "cold war" ice would melt. All this is of course welcome. What the people of the world demand is that the US government's peaceful talk can be turned into practical action. But people cannot but be very vigilant that while the US authorities are making some gestures to ease the situation, they are stepping up the development of missile weapons, actively strengthening military blocs, and trying to restore their military superiority. Recently, even US President Eisenhower himself has continuously promoted the strengthening of military blocs during his visits abroad, insisted on long-term occupation of West Berlin at the summit of the four Western powers, and announced on New Year's Eve that the United States has the freedom to resume nuclear testing. Like the people of all countries, the Chinese people believe that these are contradictory to the peaceful wishes announced by the US government and must be opposed and stopped. In any case, if the US government does not actually implement measures that are conducive to peace, but continues to actively expand its armaments and prepare for war, then it cannot hope to use some peaceful rhetoric to confuse the people of all countries who are striving for peace. The struggle for peace is the most concerned and greatest struggle of the vast majority of mankind at present. In this struggle, the people of all countries will expose the tricks of the enemies of peace at any time, force the forces of war and aggression to retreat, until peace is effectively and reliably guaranteed. The people of all countries have learned from their own experience that strengthening the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, strengthening the unity of the international working class, strengthening the unity of socialist forces and national independence movements, and strengthening the unity of all peace-loving people are the most important guarantees for achieving victory in this struggle.

Marxists are not fortune tellers and cannot predict whether the imperialists will choose this or that path in the next decade. But one thing is extremely clear, that is, although the specific development of history may still have some twists and turns, the 1960s will never be an era in which imperialism can run rampant, but will be an era in which the forces of peace continue to achieve victory, the oppressed people continue to achieve victory, and socialism continues to achieve victory. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The socialist system will eventually replace the capitalist system, which is an objective law independent of people's own will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will happen sooner or later, and it will inevitably achieve victory." Isn't it time for the gentlemen who still believe in the policies of aggression and war to wake up?

The moribund and unscrupulous imperialists and reactionaries of various countries are fantasizing about provoking the unity of socialist countries, provoking the unity between socialist countries and Asian and African peaceful and neutral countries, and hoping to find some life-saving remedies from here. One of their spearheads of provocation is now directed at China, saying that a powerful China will become a "threat" to its neighbors. But such nonsense cannot deceive anyone who seriously observes the truth of things. The socialist people's China led by the proletariat is a country that is loyal to the position of internationalism, loyal to the cause of anti-imperialism, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Its development cannot, should not, and will not be allowed to "threaten" anyone. On the contrary, it must carry out its construction in mutual assistance and cooperation with other friendly countries and the people of all countries, not to mention carrying out the common struggle to maintain peace and oppose aggression. China's fraternal unity with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is in the fundamental interests of the socialist countries and the people of the world, and is forever unbreakable. The imperialists and reactionaries of various countries will never be able to see the day when they can undermine this unity. China's friendship with neighboring friendly countries in Asia, as well as the friendship with the people of neighboring countries that have not yet established diplomatic relations, is also in the fundamental interests of China and the relevant countries. Those who deliberately undermine this friendship cannot gain the support of the people. Therefore, in the coming decade, not only will the unity of socialist countries continue to be consolidated and developed, but also the friendship between all peace-loving countries and people in Asia will continue to increase due to the efforts of the people of Asian countries. This is beyond doubt.

The Chinese people's goal is to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in the new decade, basically establish a complete industrial system, basically realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, and science and culture, and thus build China into a strong socialist country.

The struggle for peace is the most concerned and greatest struggle of the vast majority of mankind at present. In this struggle, the people of all countries will expose the tricks of the enemies of peace at any time, force the forces of war and aggression to retreat, until peace is effectively and reliably guaranteed. The people of all countries have learned from their own experience that strengthening the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, strengthening the unity of the international working class, strengthening the unity of socialist forces and national independence movements, and strengthening the unity of all peace-loving people are the most important guarantees for achieving victory in this struggle.

    展望六十年代
    二十世纪五十年代（1950—1959）的最后一年，1959年，过去了；六十年代（1960—1969）的第一年，1960年，开始了。十年不过是人类历史的一瞬。但是，无论在中国和世界，过去的十年却经历了伟大的、深刻的变化，而新的十年在我们面前展现着无限的光明和希望。
    中华人民共和国刚刚庆祝了自己诞生的十周年。在这个十年里，依靠以中国共产党为领导核心的人民民主专政，中国完成了除台湾以外的国家的统一，完成了全国范围的民主改革（西藏的民主改革现在正在顺利进行中），随后，在民主改革彻底胜利的基础上，完成了对于农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，并且胜利地进行了思想政治战线方面的社会主义革命。中国人民用了三年的时间，完成了受长期战争破坏的国民经济的恢复工作；接着，从1953年开始，进行了七年的有计划的经济建设工作。这一切，就使中国的社会政治面貌发生了几千年以来所没有过的根本转变。中国的经济文化状况，虽然比较起来还是落后的，也跟解放以前不可同日而语。
    中国的革命和建设的胜利，是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营在世界上的最伟大胜利之一，是马克思列宁主义在历史上的最伟大胜利之一。中国的社会主义事业，在一切基本原则方面，严格地遵循着马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，忠实地继承着和发展着十月革命的光荣事业。同时，在许多具体步骤和形式方面，它又带有自己的民族的和国家的历史特点。这是必然的和当然的。共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议宣言说：“马克思列宁主义要求根据每个国家的具体历史条件，创造性地运用社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同原则，不允许机械地抄袭他国共产党的政策和策略。列宁曾经多次告诫，必须使共产主义的基本原则正确地适应于民族的和民族国家的特殊情况。一个无产阶级政党如果忽视了民族特点，就必然会脱离生活，脱离群众，就必然会使社会主义事业遭受损失。”在中国这样一个拥有占人类四分之一人口的大国，在革命和建设中运用马克思列宁主义的时候，如果没有自己的特点，那就更加不可想像了。中国共产党人和全国人民，在过去十年的前一个阶段中，首先致力于按照中国的条件，实现全国范围的民主改革和社会主义改造；直到这两个任务顺利完成以后，才把注意力集中到在中国的条件下发展社会主义建设这样一个新的任务上。在后一个任务方面，党和人民在毛泽东同志的领导之下，根据最近时期的经验，找到了三个法宝，这就是：建设社会主义的总路线，大跃进的发展速度和人民公社的组织形式。
    党的建设社会主义的总路线，围绕着这个总路线的一套“两条腿走路”的方针，由此而产生的国民经济的大跃进，以及适应大跃进的需要而出现的人民公社，这些都是中国人民事业中的新事物，而新事物总是不免要引起一些人的怀疑的。它们究竟是不是正确和有效呢？究竟是不是得到人民群众的拥护呢？如果1958年的经验还没有解除某些人的疑问的话，那么，1959年的经验就给了这些问题以进一步的肯定的回答。党的八届八中全会关于在1959年提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标的号召，已经胜利地实现了。全国完成和超额完成计划指标的情况，不久就可以公布。根据初步的统计，1959年的工业总产值大大超过了国家的计划，其中钢产量达到一千三百多万吨，即比1958年增长了五百万吨以上，或者60％以上。工业产品，无论重工业和轻工业，品种都有了增加，质量都有了提高，成本都有了降低。小型工业和县、社工业，已经进入了巩固发展的阶段，在国民经济中正在发挥重要的作用。农业生产，在战胜了几十年未有的特大自然灾害之后，就全国说来，仍然得到了比1958年更大的丰收。农业总产值显著地超额完成了国家的计划。全国人民公社的组织日益健全，优越性日益显著，在农民中的威信日益增高。人民的收入增加了，市场的供应也相应地增加了。人民的文化教育事业也得到了迅速的进展。总之，全国城乡都洋溢着欣欣向荣的气象。而按照美国的宣传机器说来，1959年却是中国“最暗淡的年份”和“最贫困的年份”。如果所谓“最暗淡”和“最贫困”就是这么一回事，那么，就让一些靠“美援”维持统治的国家也来一些这样的“暗淡”和“贫困”吧！可惜，即使帝国主义者愿意这样作，他们也绝对不可能作到这一点。
    由于总路线、大跃进和人民公社的确定无疑的胜利，全中国的生活正在沸腾着。被解放了的六亿五千万人这样一个伟大的生产力，正在向着充分认清了的目的地，沿着充分认清了的路线，采取着充分认清了的方法，开足马力向前飞跑。不这样也是不可能的，因为中国的经济和文化太落后了，帝国主义一直在威胁着我们，甚至侵占着我们的领土，而妨碍人民前进的落后的生产关系和上层建筑已经推翻了，人民已经觉醒起来，不再沉睡了。这是掌握了自己命运的人民，这是团结一致的、组织起来的人民，这是被马克思列宁主义教育了的、被共产主义精神教育了的、思想解放、敢想敢说敢做的人民。这样的人民，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞下，掌握了1958年和1959年的连续大跃进的经验，不但对于1960年的继续跃进和更好的跃进，充满了决心和信心，而且对于整个六十年代的连续跃进，也充满决心和信心。中国人民的奋斗目标是，在新的十年间，要在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，基本上建立起完整的工业体系，基本上实现工业、农业和科学文化的现代化，从而把中国建成为一个强大的社会主义国家。诚然，就在那时，中国的工农业产品按人口计算起来，水平也还是很低的，同英国比较起来，还是很落后的。要彻底克服这种落后状态，还需要更多的时间。正因为这样，中国人民不能不坚持总路线，坚持大跃进，坚持人民公社，以便较早地脱离落后状态。
    中国人民的社会主义事业，是以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营的整个事业的一部分，并且是在苏联和其他社会主义国家的慷慨援助之下发展的。中国人民满腔热情地注意着苏联和其他兄弟国家的社会主义事业和共产主义建设事业的发展，并且从它们的伟大胜利中不断地得到新的鼓舞和启示。从1950年到1958年，社会主义阵营各国的工业生产增加了约一点六倍，而资本主义各国只增加了37％。社会主义阵营各国在1958年的工业总产值，已经占全世界工业总产值的约40％。在农业方面，社会主义阵营各国生产的粮食和棉花，在1958年已经分别占全世界总产量的43％和38％。这就是说，按人口计算，社会主义世界的工业和农业的平均水平，都已经超过了资本主义世界的平均水平。1959年是社会主义各国继续突飞猛进的一年。苏联共产党在1959年1月至2月举行的第二十一次代表大会，宣告了苏联已经进入全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期，通过了规模空前雄伟的发展国民经济的七年（1959—1965）计划的控制数字，规定要在七年内，在按人口平均计算的工业品产量上超过欧洲最发达的资本主义国家，并且在某些最主要的产品的绝对产量上超过美国目前的水平。现在全苏联人民正在为提前超额完成这一伟大的计划而胜利地奋斗。苏联的先进的科学技术在1959年获得了特别巨大的成就，成功地发射了三支宇宙火箭，并且在人类历史上第一次揭开了月球背面的秘密。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国等社会主义国家，在经济发展方面，也在为赶上和超过欧洲和亚洲的最发达的资本主义国家而积极地斗争。在所有社会主义阵营各国，都展开了轰轰烈烈的技术革新和劳动竞赛运动。发展得最快的资本主义国家，在发展速度方面也赶不上社会主义国家。因此，完全可以预料，在今后的十年中，社会主义世界在经济方面必将对于资本主义世界占压倒的优势。
    同社会主义世界相反，资本主义世界在展望六十年代的时候，却只觉得前途茫茫。过去的十年，是资本主义世界停滞、动荡和分崩离析的十年。从第二次世界大战结束以后，共有十四亿左右人口的国家，包括中国在内，取得了独立的地位。目前还直接处在帝国主义殖民枷锁下的人民，已经减少到一亿六千万人左右。争取和维护民族独立的斗争，在时间上连绵不断，在空间上遍及亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲直至欧洲的一部分。帝国主义企图保持其原有的殖民体系已不可能，实行新的民族侵略也遇到越来越大的反抗。帝国主义国家相互间的斗争日趋激烈。同时，各国的工人运动、农民运动以及其他劳动人民争取民主自由和生活权利的斗争，也有了进一步的发展。国际形势越来越不利于帝国主义，首先是越来越不利于美帝国主义。毛泽东同志在1957年提出的“东风压倒西风”的著名论断，连西方资产阶级的许多代言人也不能不承认了。美国的前国务卿杜勒斯在1958年11月的一次演说中说：“我们确实生活在一个形势发生变动的真正旋风里。”美国的政论家李普曼写道：“苏联成就的惊人速度预示着，俄国不仅在军事力量方面，而且在政治方面和经济方面的影响都在增长……我们不仅落后，而且在目前实际情况下，我们今后仍将落后。”他在另一篇文章里说，现在“最伟大的国家在东欧和亚洲”，“大西洋集团不再是世界的政治中心了”。过去的十年是如此；难道在今后的十年中，在社会主义世界更加强大和更占优势的六十年代中，西方资产阶级反而有什么回天的妙术吗？
    美帝国主义长时期以来，就把赌注押在新战争方面。美国的直接军事开支，在1960财政年度仍保持在四百一十亿美元左右的水平。美国现在有武装部队一百多万人驻扎在七十多个国家和地区，有二百五十个海外军事基地，并且在国内、欧洲、北非、中东、远东各地加紧建立导弹基地。但是战争从来不能改变历史发展的规律。在目前世界力量对比的条件下，美帝国主义企图用战争来挽救资本主义的没落更是梦想。尽人皆知，甚至军事的优势，现在或者将来也都不属于西方。社会主义国家是坚决反对战争的。社会主义国家主张缓和国际紧张局势，主张实现普遍裁军，主张不同社会制度各国和平共处、和平竞赛。但是社会主义各国永远也不会在帝国主义的战争威胁前面屈服。如果帝国主义者一定要把战争强加在社会主义国家身上，那么，必然的结果只能是帝国主义的彻底消灭。
    世界力量对比的这种显著的变化，给各国人民争取和平的斗争造成了空前有利的条件。社会主义阵营是全世界维护和平的决定性力量。它的空前强大和它的坚定不移的和平外交政策的胜利，大大地鼓舞了和平力量，打击了战争力量。在过去一年里，以苏联为首的社会主义各国，为了争取缓和紧张局势，进行了一系列的重大努力。特别是苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国，苏联提出全面彻底的裁军方案，受到了全世界人民的热烈欢迎。在强大的和平潮流面前，美国同意了召开最高级会议，并且也表示希望“冷战”冰块的消融。这一切当然是值得欢迎的。全世界人民所要求的是，美国政府的和平谈论能够变为实际行动。但是人们不能不十分警惕的是，美国当局在它作出一些缓和局势的表示的同时，却在加紧发展导弹武器，积极加强军事集团，力图恢复它的军事优势。最近，甚至美国总统艾森豪威尔本人，也在出国访问期间连续宣传加强军事集团，在西方四国首脑会议上坚持长期占领西柏林，并且在新年的前夜宣布美国有恢复核试验的自由。中国人民和各国人民一样，认为这些都是同美国政府所宣布的和平愿望相矛盾的，是必须加以反对和制止的。无论如何，如果美国政府不在实际上执行有利于和平的措施，而继续积极扩军备战，那么，它是不能希望用一些和平辞令使各国争取和平的人民受到迷惑的。争取和平的斗争，是当前绝大多数人类所最关切的和最伟大的斗争。各国人民在这个斗争中，将随时揭穿和平的敌人的诡计，迫使战争势力和侵略势力退却，直至和平得到切实可靠的保障。各国人民从自己的经验中认识到，加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结，加强国际工人阶级的团结，加强社会主义力量同民族独立运动的团结，加强一切爱好和平的人民的团结，是取得这一斗争的胜利的最重要的保证。
    马克思主义者不是算命先生，不能算出帝国主义者在今后十年中究竟将选择这样或者那样的道路。但是有一点是异常清楚的，就是尽管历史的具体发展还会有某些曲折，六十年代将决不是帝国主义可以横行霸道的时代，而将是和平势力继续取得胜利、被压迫人民继续取得胜利、社会主义继续取得胜利的时代。毛泽东同志说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”还在迷信侵略政策和战争政策的老爷们，不是早该醒醒了吗？
    日暮途穷、卑鄙无耻的帝国主义者和各国反动派，异想天开地企图挑拨社会主义各国的团结，挑拨社会主义国家和亚非和平中立国家之间的团结，幻想从这里找到什么救命的药方。他们的挑拨的矛头之一现在是指向中国，说什么强大起来的中国将要成为自己的邻邦的一种“威胁”。但是这种胡言乱语是欺骗不了任何认真观察事物真相的人的。无产阶级领导的社会主义的人民中国，是一个忠于国际主义立场、忠于反帝国主义事业和和平共处五项原则的国家，它的发展不可能、不应该也不允许“威胁”任何人。相反，它必须在同别的友好国家和各国人民的互助合作中进行自己的建设，更不必说进行维护和平、反对侵略的共同斗争了。中国同苏联和其他社会主义国家的兄弟般的团结，是社会主义各国人民和全世界人民的根本利益所在，是永远牢不可破的，帝国主义者和各国反动派永远也休想看到他们有能够破坏这种团结的一天。中国同亚洲各邻近友好国家的友谊，以及还没有建交的邻近国家人民的友谊，也是中国和有关各国人民的根本利益所在。那些蓄谋损害这种友谊的人是不可能得到人民的支持的。因此，在未来的十年中，不但社会主义国家的团结将不断地获得巩固和发展，而且亚洲一切爱好和平的国家和人民之间的友谊，也将由于亚洲各国人民的努力而继续增进。这是毫无疑问的。
    中国人民的奋斗目标是，在新的十年间，要在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，基本上建立起完整的工业体系，基本上实现工业、农业和科学文化的现代化，从而把中国建成为一个强大的社会主义国家。
    争取和平的斗争，是当前绝大多数人类所最关切的和最伟大的斗争，各国人民在这个斗争中，将随时揭穿和平的敌人的诡计，迫使战争势力和侵略势力退却，直至和平得到切实可靠的保障。各国人民从自己的经验中认识到，加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结，加强国际工人阶级的团结，加强社会主义力量同民族独立运动的团结，加强一切爱好和平的人民的团结，是取得这一斗争的胜利的最重要的保证。
