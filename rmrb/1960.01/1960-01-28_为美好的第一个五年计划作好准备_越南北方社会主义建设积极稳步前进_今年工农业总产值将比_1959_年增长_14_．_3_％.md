Nguyen Van Tran, Deputy Director of the Vietnamese State Planning Committee, in his recent report at the Vietnamese 1960 National Plan Transmission Conference and in his articles continuously published in the Vietnamese "People's Daily," clarified the tasks of the Vietnamese 1960 National Plan.

Nguyen Van Tran said that 1960 occupies an important position in the cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction in North Vietnam. This year will be the final year of Vietnam's three-year (1958-1960) plan and will be the year to prepare to enter the promising first five-year plan.

Nguyen Van Tran said that in 1960, it is necessary to continue to guide the cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction in North Vietnam to move forward actively and steadily on the basis of rapid and vigorous advancement. He said that in 1960, the total output value of industry and agriculture will increase by 14.3% compared to 1959, of which the output value of agriculture and sideline occupations will increase by 11.5%, the output value of industry will increase by 25.2%, and the output value of handicrafts will increase by 12.7%.

Nguyen Van Tran said that in terms of agricultural production, the central task for 1960 is to transform and develop agriculture, and on the basis of expanding and consolidating the agricultural collectivization movement, to further comprehensively develop agricultural production, with the primary focus on grain production (including rice and miscellaneous grains). In 1960, the annual rice production will increase by 4.7% compared to 1959.

Nguyen Van Tran pointed out that industry will experience rapid development in 1960. This year, the output value of state-owned industry will account for 82.4% of the total industrial output value, an increase of 26.4% compared to 1959. Due to the victory of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the output value of joint state-private industry will account for 17.6% of the total industrial output value this year. In industrial production, the production of means of production will increase by 29.9%, and the production of consumer goods will increase by 14.7%.

Nguyen Van Tran said that the amount of investment in basic construction in 1960 will increase by 40% compared to last year. The volume of freight transportation in the transportation industry will increase by 33% compared to last year, of which the volume of freight transportation in the state-owned transportation industry will account for 73.6% of the total freight volume, an increase of 35.8% compared to last year. Retail sales will increase by 14.1% compared to last year, of which retail sales by state-owned commercial enterprises will increase by 18.3% compared to last year.

Nguyen Van Tran pointed out that in terms of socialist transformation, the collectivization of agriculture and handicrafts will be basically completed in 1960, and the transformation of private capitalist industry and commerce will be basically completed. He said that this year the state-owned economy will be even stronger. Socialist relations of production will dominate the entire national economy.

Nguyen Van Tran said that in 1960, the cultural and educational undertakings in North Vietnam will be further developed, and the people's lives will be further improved. He said that in 1960, universal primary education will be implemented among the people throughout the country, and the number of primary and secondary school students will reach 1,959,000, an increase of 29.7% compared to last year; the number of university students will reach 12,649, an increase of 49.3% compared to last year, and the number of secondary vocational students will reach 33,220, an increase of 93.5% compared to last year.

The number of employees this year will increase by 50,000 compared to last year, and the total wage bill will increase by 31.3%. The people's purchasing power will increase by 14.1% compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 26th. This reporter reports: On the eve of the Spring Festival, North Vietnam is filled with joy. Every household is decorated with lanterns and streamers, and people are joyfully preparing to celebrate a "united, happy, victorious, and thrifty Spring Festival."

Amidst the sound of firecrackers, good news is frequently reported from the industrial and agricultural fronts. Many enterprises have already completed their January production plans ahead of schedule. The Haiphong Worsted Mill and the Haiphong Ha Long Canned Fish Factory fishing team entered the second month of the year on the 22nd and 23rd respectively. The carpet branch of the Nam Dinh Textile Factory produced 3,400 more blankets than planned in the first twenty days of January, and the entire factory is continuing to launch a competition campaign to complete this year's production plan one and a half months ahead of schedule. In terms of agricultural production, farmers in various regions have put forward the resounding slogan of "Striving to complete rice transplanting before the Spring Festival," and many counties and townships have successfully completed the task.

This year's Spring Festival market in Hanoi is prosperous. The commercial departments have added many retail stations and mobile sales teams. Huang Guosheng, Deputy Minister of Commerce, and Wu Ding, Director of the Hanoi Municipal Bureau of Commerce, recently worked as salespersons in department stores and mobile sales teams to serve the citizens.

The purchasing power of the working people has increased significantly this year. Near the most bustling Dong Xuan Market, people buying New Year goods are shoulder to shoulder. Suburban farmers, who achieved unprecedented harvests last year, have flocked to the city to buy New Year goods, and they have been warmly received by salespersons. Although people's lives have further improved compared to previous years, they are responding to the government's call to celebrate the Spring Festival thriftily. Before the Spring Festival, people are making all preparations in their work to ensure that they achieve greater success in production and work after the Spring Festival.

Under the cruel persecution and exploitation of the American-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, the people of South Vietnam are spending the Spring Festival in a different scene. According to recent reports in South Vietnamese newspapers, prices in various parts of South Vietnam have risen sharply, and the black market and speculation are becoming increasingly serious. Cloth prices in Saigon have recently risen by 50%, and people have had to rush to buy some major non-staple foods at black market prices. The news said that this year's sales of New Year goods in Saigon have decreased by 50% to 70% compared to last year.

As the Spring Festival approaches, South Vietnamese workers are launching various forms of struggle to improve their lives and increase wages, and to oppose the oppression and exploitation of the American-Ngo Dinh Diem clique. More than 8,000 rubber workers in Long Thanh, Sa Cat, Loc Ninh and other counties have held strikes since the end of December last year. Despite being subjected to armed suppression by the South Vietnamese authorities, the struggle movement is continuing to rise. Saigon passenger car workers and many factory workers have demanded bonuses and family allowances for the Spring Festival. According to incomplete statistics, in December last year alone, there were twenty various forms of workers' struggles in South Vietnam, with 14,500 workers participating in the struggle movement.

Sun Deqing, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, wrote a letter on the eve of the Spring Festival to express his condolences to the compatriots in South Vietnam under the rule of the American-Ngo Dinh Diem clique. Sun Deqing wished the people of South Vietnam to unite more closely and strengthen their struggle in the new year. He said that our beloved motherland will surely achieve unification, and the cause of building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam will surely succeed.

    阮文珍指出，1960年的工业将有迅速的发展。今年国营工业的产值将占工业总产值的82．4％，比1959年增长26．4％。由于对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的胜利，今年公私合营工业的产值将占工业总产值的17．6％。在工业生产中，生产资料将增长29．9％，生活资料将增长14．7％。

    新华社河内26日电　本社记者报道：春节前夕，越南北方洋溢着一片欢乐景象。家家户户张灯结彩，人们喜气洋洋地准备欢度一个“团结、愉快、胜利和节约的春节”。
    爆竹声中，工农业战线上喜报频传。许多企业已经提前完成1月份生产计划。海防绒线厂、海防下龙罐头鱼厂捕鱼队，分别在22日、23日跨进今年的第二个月。南定纺织厂织毯分厂在1月份头二十天就比原定计划多生产了三千四百床毛毯，全厂正在继续展开竞赛运动，争取提前一个半月完成今年的生产计划。在农业生产方面，各地农民提出了“力争春节前插完秧”的响亮口号，许多县、乡已经胜利完成任务。
    今年春节，河内市场繁荣。商业部门增辟了许多零售站和流动售货队。商业部副部长黄国盛、河内市商业局长武定最近分别到百货公司和流动售货队当售货员，为市民服务。
    今年劳动人民的购买力显著提高。最热闹的同春市场附近，购买年货的人摩肩接踵。去年获得空前大丰收的郊区农民纷纷进城购买年货，他们受到售货员的热情接待。虽然人们的生活比往年获得了进一步的改善，但是他们响应政府的号召，节约过春节。春节前，人们在工作中作好一切准备，保证春节后在生产和工作中争取更大的成绩。
    在美国—吴庭艳集团残酷迫害和压榨下的南越人民，却在另外一种景象下度春节。据南越报纸最近报道，南越各地的物价猛涨，黑市和投机买卖日益严重。西贡的布价最近涨了50％，人们不得不以黑市价格去抢购一些主要的副食品。消息说，今年西贡年货销售量比去年下降了50％—70％。
    在临近春节的时候，南越工人展开着各种形式的斗争，争取改善生活和提高工资，反对美国—吴庭艳集团的压迫和剥削。从去年12月下旬开始的隆城、沙吉、禄宁等县八千多橡胶工人举行了罢工，尽管遭受到南越当局的武力镇压，但斗争运动正在继续高涨。西贡客运汽车工人和许多工厂工人纷纷要求春节发给奖金和家庭津贴。据不完全统计，仅去年12月份，南越就爆发了二十起各种形式的工人斗争，参加斗争运动的工人达一万四千五百人。
    越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团主席孙德胜在春节前夕写信慰问在美国—吴庭艳集团统治下的南越同胞。孙德胜祝南越人民在新的一年中更加紧密地团结起来，加强斗争。他说，我们可爱的祖国一定会实现统一，为建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南的事业一定会获得成功。（附图片）
