	Spring Preparation Briefs

	Early Selection of Rice Seedling Fields, Early Application of Base Fertilizer
	In order to cultivate strong seedlings and reap a bumper harvest of early rice this year, the Jiji Commune in Wuwei County, Anhui Province, launched an activity of "early selection of rice seedling fields and early application of base fertilizer." As of January 15th, the entire commune had selected 1,756 mu of qualified seedling fields, plowed and harrowed them three times each, applied wax fertilizer three times, and implemented a responsibility system of inserting signs for inspection and management by dedicated personnel.

	Appraise and Promote New Farm Tools
	The farm tool factory of the Zongzhai Brigade in the Zongzhai Commune of Xining City, Qinghai Province, is rushing to produce new farm tools for this year's spring plowing. The Zongzhai Brigade exhibited more than 30 kinds of farm tools they had trial-produced and modified, such as seedling replanting machines, manure spreaders, bean planters, and vegetable seeders, at the brigade's on-site farm tool reform meeting. The on-site meeting evaluated and appraised these farm tools. Now, the brigade's farm tool factory is mass-producing the farm tools that have been appraised and successfully tested, actively preparing for spring plowing.

	Proper Management, Strong and Healthy Draught Animals
	During spring preparation, the Qingshizui Production Team of the Tiemai People's Commune in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, Qinghai Province, focused on the feeding and management of draught animals, ensuring diligent addition of grass, frequent watering, and frequent bedding of the pens, as well as clean grass, clean feed, clean water, and clean troughs. They also paid attention to protecting pregnant animals, old, weak, sick, and young animals. In terms of management and usage, they implemented a system of feeding in shifts, diligently adding night grass, watering three times a day, and assigning fixed personnel and animals for specific tasks. Therefore, even with the current heavy labor of accumulating and delivering fertilizer, the team's draught animals still maintain a first-class fatness rate of 80%, and third-class fatness has been eliminated.

	Sufficient Seed Retention, Increased Purity
	The Guxian Commune in Taigu County, Shanxi Province, has prepared more than 150 varieties of crop seeds for spring plowing, totaling 787,480 jin. For this year's more than 50,000 mu of spring-sown crops, one to two sets of seeds have been retained, with seed purity reaching over 98%, cleanliness over 99.5%, and germination rate reaching over 97%.
