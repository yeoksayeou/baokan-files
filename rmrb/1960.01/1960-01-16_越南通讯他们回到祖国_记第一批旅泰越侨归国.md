    Vietnamese Correspondences: They Return to the Motherland
    ——On the First Group of Overseas Vietnamese from Thailand Returning Home
    By Our Correspondent Wei Zhen
      Liukou Wharf
      "Motherland,
      You are like a blossoming flower,
    Immersed in your fragrant embrace,
      The pain in my heart for decades
    Melts away in an instant."
      "Motherland,
      You are like the golden sun,
    Illuminating the happiness of our old age,
      Illuminating the bright future
    Of our descendants for generations to come."
    Fifty-year-old Mr. Mo, an overseas Vietnamese from Thailand, poured out his feelings to the reporter in the form of the above poem in the first moments of setting foot in Haiphong, the gateway to the motherland. Although he only went to school for a few days, he used poetic language to express his wonderful feelings at the very first moment of returning home.
    Mr. Mo was one of the first group of overseas Vietnamese from Thailand to return to North Vietnam on January 10. The vast majority of this group were elderly people, women, and children. On the night before arriving in Haiphong, like many other overseas Vietnamese on the ship, Mr. Mo tossed and turned, unable to sleep. "Having been away from the motherland for so many years, what has it become? How will the people of the motherland treat compatriots who have been away for so long?" As the sun rose, Mr. Mo's heart beat faster and faster.
    In Haiphong—the gateway to northern Vietnam—the overseas Vietnamese no longer saw a French gunboat, nor did they see a colonizer wielding a whip. The female tractor driver on the dock aroused great interest among the overseas Vietnamese, and they watched intently as she operated it.
    The shore was a sea of ​​gold star red flags and colorful flags, with a huge crowd of people packing Liukou Wharf. Tens of thousands of people from the motherland—the relatives they had been longing for day and night—were there. Cheers, songs, and slogans made the entire harbor boil. Bouquets of flowers flew from the hands of the joyous young men and women on the dock to the ship's rails.
    "How beautifully dressed are the young sisters of the motherland!" said Phan Thi Tinh, a nineteen-year-old overseas Vietnamese seamstress, with emotion. "How hearty and touching is their laughter. I guess they must be living very happily!" For people who have been away from the motherland for a long time, all of this is so fresh and so beautiful!
    At this joyous moment, on and off the ship, in front of and behind the ship, many women and elderly people covered their faces and wept. The moment of happiness had arrived; pour out the bitterness that had accumulated in their hearts in the past.
          Blood-Stained Mekong River
    In January fifteen years ago, the clouds of colonialism once again enveloped Laos. The French army, which had been beaten by the Japanese invaders, attempted to seize the revolutionary fruits of the Vietnamese and Lao people after World War II, armed by American and British imperialism. In Vietnam, the war of resistance against France broke out; in Laos, 60,000 to 70,000 overseas Vietnamese (including family members) resolutely stood together with the Lao people to jointly defend the resistance government headed by Prince Phetsarath (deceased). Prince Souphanouvong was then the Minister of Defense of the resistance government.
    The brutal colonizers hated the overseas Vietnamese to the bone. On March 21, 1946, a plan to massacre overseas Vietnamese in Laos began to be implemented. The headquarters of the French invading army issued an order: "Overseas Vietnamese will be killed without exception." In the Thakhek area alone, several thousand overseas Vietnamese were killed by bayonets and gunfire in an instant. Women and the elderly were not spared either. Children were tied into sacks, pierced with bayonets, and then thrown into the river. This is the famous "Thakhek Massacre" in history.
    Under the attack and frantic massacre of imperialism, the weak resistance government was forced to flee to Thailand eight months after its establishment. Only Prince Souphanouvong and some people stayed behind to persist in the resistance. Except for individual Vietnamese traitors and lackeys, all the overseas Vietnamese temporarily withdrew from Laos and went to Thailand. This was a bloody migration: the French army tracked and pursued them, bombing and strafing. When the overseas Vietnamese, supporting the old and carrying the young, reached the western border of Laos, the rolling Mekong River stood in their way. With a natural barrier in front and pursuers behind, they had no choice but to crowd onto various makeshift river-crossing tools and race against time to cross the river day and night. French planes bombed and strafed the Mekong River in turn, and many overseas Vietnamese families were submerged in the waves. The scene of the Mekong River stained with blood is still vivid in the memory of many overseas Vietnamese.
    The French army's brutal massacre angered the broad masses of the Thai people on the other side of the river, and they warmly received the more than 50,000 overseas Vietnamese who crossed the Mekong River. The more than 20,000 overseas Vietnamese originally residing in Thailand also generously helped, and the lives of the overseas Vietnamese who crossed the river were quickly settled. At the same time, they also changed from overseas Vietnamese in Laos to overseas Vietnamese in Thailand.
      "National independence must be defended, and blood debts must be repaid with blood!"—The overseas Vietnamese issued a solemn oath; the flames of patriotism and revenge were burning fiercely in their hearts. Parents encouraged their children, and wives encouraged their husbands. A "National Salvation Army" was quickly established, and then several armed teams were established one after another, and they bravely fought back to Vietnam and Laos. Together with the people of the motherland and Laos, they inflicted extremely heavy blows on the French invaders. They were worthy of being outstanding children of the overseas Vietnamese. In the eight or nine years of war, about two-thirds of their personnel gloriously sacrificed, but the revolutionary seeds they sowed blossomed everywhere. During the war of resistance, in the western Indochina front alone, they and the armed forces of the local people together contained 60,000 French troops, preventing them from being transferred eastward.
        Tenacious Struggle
    On November 8, 1947, with the support and instigation of American imperialism, Thai traitor Plaek Phibunsongkhram, who had cooperated with the Japanese invaders, launched a fascist coup and re-ascended the dictatorial throne. Since then, the overseas Vietnamese in Thailand have been subjected to a series of dark storms.
    Around 1953, under the instigation of American imperialism, the Plaek Phibunsongkhram authorities successively carried out large-scale persecution of overseas Vietnamese, attempting to concentrate most of the overseas Vietnamese and hand them over to the French colonialists.
    A serious struggle thus unfolded. When the reactionary authorities arrested a large number of young and middle-aged people, loaded them onto cars, and prepared to transport them away, thousands of women threw themselves on the road to prevent the cars from advancing. The police and gendarmes used great force but could not disperse them. The bloodthirsty executioners drove forward, crushing some of the women to death, but the remaining women still lay there, motionless. The executioners trembled and were forced to release the young and middle-aged people.
    In other places, the overseas Vietnamese who were forced to be handed over to the French colonialists nailed coffins in every household, expressing their determination to die rather than leave. Individual overseas Vietnamese who were arrested and about to be sent away used self-disembowelment to express their protest and fulfill their oath not to coexist with the colonialists.
    This heroic and magnificent struggle greatly moved the people of all strata in Thailand, especially the working people, who expressed great sympathy for the overseas Vietnamese.
    After the restoration of peace in Indochina, the American-Diem clique vigorously coerced overseas Vietnamese to go to South Vietnam. However, in the face of the overseas Vietnamese, who had clear distinctions between love and hate and firm stances, their conspiracy suffered a shameful failure.
    Last year, the Thai Red Cross Society, with the permission of the current government, signed an agreement with the Vietnamese Red Cross Society on the repatriation of overseas Vietnamese in Thailand. According to the results of repatriation registration among the overseas Vietnamese based on the agreement, more than 95% of the overseas Vietnamese registered to return to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
      Working Together to Build the Motherland
    A large red flag with a gold star and several portraits of President Ho Chi Minh, which were brought down from the ship by a group of overseas Vietnamese, attracted people's attention. They were preserved by the overseas Vietnamese after experiencing countless hardships. People rushed up and surrounded them tightly.
    For the loyal and devoted overseas Vietnamese, the people of the motherland sent them endless cheers.
    The reporter asked a group of overseas Vietnamese children, "What do you most hope for after returning to the motherland?" They said in unison, "To see Uncle Ho. He will give us books to read." Mrs. Le Thi An, a seventy-five-year-old woman, also said that she eagerly hoped to see President Ho.
    President Ho seemed to understand the feelings of the overseas Vietnamese. He suddenly arrived just after the overseas Vietnamese had disembarked from the ship and gave them heartfelt greetings. His short speech to the overseas Vietnamese brought the excitement of the entire audience to its peak. Under his leadership, tens of thousands of fists were raised to the sky again and again with cheers.
    Vietnamese writer Nguyen Nhat Lam wrote in his poem:
    "You are returning, just in time for a joyous moment:
        The 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party,
    The 15th birthday of the Republic,
        Uncle Ho will celebrate his 70th birthday soon,
    Our nation is advancing with overwhelming force,
        Taking giant strides,
    Come back and work together,
        To build a happy homeland,
    Like a flock of swallows returning,
        Welcoming your own spring in the land."

    越南通讯他们回到祖国
    ——记第一批旅泰越侨归国
    本报记者　韦真
      六库码头
      “祖国，
      你像一片盛开的花朵，
    浸浴在您芳馥的胸中，
      我数十年来心中的创痛
    倾刻消融。”
      “祖国，
      你好比金色的太阳，
    照耀着我们晚年的幸福，
      照耀着子孙万代的
    灿烂前程。”
    五十岁的旅泰越侨莫老人在踏上祖国大门海防市的第一刻钟，就向记者倾吐了自己上述的心情。尽管他只上过几天学，但他用诗篇一般的语言讲出自己归国最初一刻的美好感受。
    莫老人是1月10日第一批回到北越的旅泰越侨中的一个，这批越侨绝大部分是老人、妇女和儿童。在到达海防的前一天夜里，同许多其它船上的越侨一样，莫老人翻来复去怎么也睡不着。“离开祖国这么多年，它变成什么样了呢？祖国人民将怎样对待离开这么久的侨胞呢？”随着旭日的升起，莫老人的心一分钟比一分钟跳得更加剧烈。
    在海防——越南北方的大门，越侨们再也看不见一艘法国炮舰，再也望不见一个挥动皮鞭的殖民者了。码头上出现的女拖曳车手，引起越侨们的极大兴趣，他们聚精会神地看着她怎样操作。
    岸上是一片金星红旗和五色缤纷的彩旗，人山人海，挤得六库码头水泄不通。几万祖国的人民——日夜想望的亲人，就在那里。欢呼声、歌唱声、口号声使整个海港都沸腾了。一束束的鲜花，从码头上欢欣雀跃的男女青年们的手里，飞上了船舷。
    “祖国的青年姊妹们穿得多么漂亮啊！”十九岁的越侨女裁缝潘氏性感慨地说：“她们笑得多么爽朗感人，我猜想，她们一定生活得非常幸福愉快！”对于久别祖国的人们，这一切是多么新鲜，多么美好啊！
    就在这欢乐的时刻，船上船下，船前船后，有多少妇女、老人掩脸哭泣。幸福的时刻来到了，过去积郁在心头的苦水，尽情地倾倒吧。
          血染湄公河
    十五年前的一月里，殖民主义的阴云重新笼罩着老挝。曾经被日寇打得抱头鼠窜的法军，在二次大战后又在美、英帝国主义武装之下，企图侵夺越南和老挝人民的革命果实。在越南，抗法战争爆发了；在老挝，六、七万越侨（连同家属）坚决同老挝人民站在一起，共同捍卫以佩萨拉亲王（已逝世）为首的抗战政府。苏发努冯亲王当时就是抗战政府的国防部长。
    残暴的殖民者恨透了越侨。1946年3月21日，一场血洗老挝越侨的计划开始实施。进攻从甘蒙省开始，法国侵略军总部下达命令：“越侨一概格杀勿论”。仅在他曲一带，顷刻之间，几千越侨被刺刀和乱枪杀害。妇女、老人也不能幸免。孩子们被捆入麻袋，用刺刀戳穿，然后扔进河里。这就是历史上著名的“他曲惨案”。
    在帝国主义的进攻和疯狂血洗下，幼弱的抗战政府成立八个月后被迫逃亡到泰国，只有苏发努冯亲王和部分人留下坚持抗战，越侨除了个别越奸走狗外，暂时全部撤出老挝，前往泰国。这是一次流血的迁移：法军跟踪追击，轰炸扫射。当扶老携幼的越侨们行至老挝西部边陲时，滚滚千里的湄公河横隔眼前，前有天堑后有追兵，不得不拥满各种简陋的渡河工具，日夜抢渡。法机轮番地在湄公河上空轰炸扫射，不少越侨全家复没在浪涛中。血染湄公河的景象，许多越侨都还历历在目。
    法军的残暴屠杀激怒了河对岸的泰国广大人民，他们给予渡过湄公河的五万多越侨以热情的接待。原居泰国的两万多名越侨更是慷慨相助，过河越侨的生活很快得到安顿。同时，他们也从老挝越侨变成了泰国越侨。
      “国家的独立必须保卫，血债必须用血来还！”——越侨们发出了壮烈的誓言；爱国、报仇的火焰在他们的胸中熊熊地燃烧着。父母勉儿女，妻子勉丈夫，一支“救国军”很快成立起来，随后又接二连三地成立了几支武装队伍，英勇地打回了越南和老挝。他们同祖国和老挝人民一起，给予法国侵略者以无比沉重的打击。他们不愧为越侨优秀的子女，在八、九年战争中，有约三分之二的人员光荣牺牲了，但他们撒下的革命种子，遍地开花。抗战期间，仅在印度支那西线，他们同当地人民的武装部队一起牵制了六万名法军，使他们不能东调。
        顽强的斗争
    1947年11月8日，在美帝国主义扶持和唆使下，曾经同日寇合作过的泰奸銮披汶发动法西斯政变，重新登上独裁宝座。从此，旅泰越侨又连续经受了一系列黑暗风暴的袭击。
    1953年前后，銮披汶当局在美帝国主义唆使下，接连对越侨进行大规模的迫害，企图把大部分越侨集中起来送交法国殖民者。
    一场严重的斗争就此展开。当反动当局逮捕大批青壮年装上汽车准备运走时，成千妇女群起扑倒在公路上阻止汽车前进，宪警费了很大力量也驱不散她们。嗜血的刽子手驱车前进，压死了一部分妇女，而其余妇女仍然声色不动地倒卧在那里。刽子手发抖了，他们被迫把青壮年们放回去。
    在另一些地方，被强迫要交给法国殖民者的越侨，家家钉了棺材，表示宁死不去的决心。个别被捕即将送走的越侨，用剖腹自杀来表示抗议和履行自己不与殖民者共生的誓言。
    这种英勇壮烈的斗争，大大感动了泰国各阶层人民、特别是劳动人民，对越侨寄以莫大同情。
    印度支那和平恢复后，美吴集团又大肆胁迫越侨去南越。但在爱憎分明、立场明确的越侨面前，他们的阴谋遭到了可耻的失败。
    去年，泰国红十字会得到现政府的准许，同越南红十字会签订了旅泰越侨返国协议。根据协议在越侨中进行返国登记的结果，95％以上的越侨登记回越南民主共和国。
      同心协力建设祖国
    一群越侨从船上带下来的一面金星大红旗和几幅胡主席像引起了人们的注意，它们是越侨们经历了无数艰辛才保存下来的。人们拥上去，把他们紧紧地围住。
    对于赤胆忠心的越侨们，祖国人民向他们发出了无尽的欢呼。
    记者问一群越侨儿童，“你们回到祖国后最希望的是什么？”他们异口同声说：“见胡伯伯，他会给我们书读”。七十五岁的老大娘黎氏恩也说，她热切希望见到胡主席。
    胡主席好像洞悉越侨的心情似的，在越侨刚下完船之后，突然来到，对越侨作了热切的慰问。他对越侨发表的简短讲话，把全场人的兴奋情绪引上了最高峰。在他带领下，几万个拳头随着欢呼声一次再一次地伸向天空。
    越南作家阮曰览在诗稿中写道：
    “你们回来，正赶上欢乐的时刻：
        党成立三十周年，
    共和国十五周岁，
        胡伯伯将临七十寿辰，
    咱们的民族正以排山倒海之势，
        跨着巨人的步伐前进，
    回来同心协力，
        建设幸福的家园，
    犹如燕子群归，
        在国土上迎接自己的春天。”
