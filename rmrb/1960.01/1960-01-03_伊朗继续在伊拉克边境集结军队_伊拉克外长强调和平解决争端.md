Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 30th - According to reports in the newspapers here today, Iraqi Foreign Minister Jawad told reporters from the Iraqi News Agency: "Iran continues to amass troops on the (Iraqi) border, which clearly means that the tension between the two countries continues to exist and complicates the issue. This is detrimental to the interests of the countries, the region, and the world."
    Jawad emphasized that Iraq is striving to resolve the dispute through direct or indirect peaceful means, abiding by and respecting treaties, agreements, and conventions, and seeking to promote good neighborly relations on the basis of historical ties and mutual benefit. However, Iraq will "resolutely defend its rights against any violation through all legitimate means."

    伊朗继续在伊拉克边境集结军队
    伊拉克外长强调和平解决争端
    新华社巴格达12月30日电　据这里的报纸今天报道，伊拉克外交部长贾瓦德对伊拉克通讯社记者发表谈话说：“伊朗继续在（伊拉克）边境集结军队，明显地意味着两国之间的紧张局势继续存在、并且使问题复杂化。这是损害国家的、地区的和国际的利益的。”
    贾瓦德强调说，伊拉克正在努力通过直接或间接的和平途径来解决争端，遵守和尊重条约、协定和公约，并且力求在历史联系和互利的基础上促进睦邻关系。但是，伊拉克将“通过一切合法途径坚决维护自己的权利，使之免受任何侵犯。”
