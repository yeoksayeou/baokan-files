Having passed through the thousand-mile-long Hexi Corridor by train and then traveled by car across several hundred miles of sparsely populated Gobi Desert, one arrives at Hami, a place of gurgling springs and shady gardens. Hami is an important town in eastern Xinjiang, a sparkling pearl in the Gobi Desert.

Several cold snaps have already covered it with a thick layer of white snow, and the temperature has dropped to about minus twenty degrees Celsius. However, here it seems as if there is no winter, and everywhere there is a bustling construction scene. Outside the city, red flags flutter in the fields, and water conservancy construction sites are busy. Entering the urban area, near the newly built houses on both sides of the road, building materials such as bricks, tiles, wood, and stone are piled up everywhere. Trains whistling loudly unload batches of equipment to support the construction of the frontier, and from here they load oil, timber, natural alkali, and various local and special products to be transported to the interior. During the day, there is a hubbub of vehicles and horses, and at night the lights are bright. The opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is like a spring breeze from the east, blowing the flowers of construction in Hami even more colorful, full of unlimited vitality. This ancient city of a thousand years is developing into a new industrial city by leaps and bounds.

A native of Hami who has been away from home for a year would be unable to recognize the place. A little over a year ago, Hami had a population of just over ten thousand people consisting of Han, Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh and thirteen other ethnic groups, today it has one hundred thousand people. In the past year or so, the area of newly built houses in Hami has been more than 250,000 square meters, which is equivalent to the building area of several old Hami cities. The north of the city, previously called Beishawo, was originally a sandy area, with only a few households scattered on the edge of the sand dunes. Now, a seven-kilometer-long and thirty-two-meter-wide avenue has been opened up, leading directly to the railway station. On both sides of the road stand many tall buildings such as the Hami Theater, Hami Hotel, and the Post and Telecommunications Building. There are also new building complexes of shops, warehouses, and factories, becoming the center of the new urban area. In 1959 alone, Hami built eleven new hotels and hostels, which, together with the existing ones, can provide food and lodging for 7,000 people, almost accommodating the entire population of the city in the early days of liberation. Many new houses are still under construction, and workers wearing leather hats are working hard on the high scaffolding.

Before 1958, there were less than 300 construction workers in Hami, now there are nearly 6,000. However, this is still far from meeting the needs of the current winter construction. To the west of the new urban area, with the railway station as the center, an embryonic form of a new industrial base has emerged. Tall factory buildings and chimneys stand one after another. Jianjiadun was originally a chaotic graveyard overgrown with reeds and haunted by wild wolves, but now more than twenty modern factories have been built here, including steel, power generation, machinery, cement, flour, and railway affiliated factories. The Hami Iron and Steel Plant is carrying out production and infrastructure construction at the same time. Next to it, the main factory building and chimney of a new power plant have just been completed, and workers are actively preparing to install steam turbine generator sets. In the past year, Hami's electricity has increased nearly tenfold, which is 380 times that before liberation, and after this new power plant is put into production, the electricity generated by one unit alone will be more than the current electricity of the entire city. Continuing west from Jianjiadun, one enters the Sandaoling coal mining area. Previously, there were only a few households here, but now there are 7,000 people. A newly built pair of mechanized coal mines with an annual output of 450,000 tons has just been put into production, and another pair of mines of the same size and a larger open-pit coal mine are also being prepared for construction. A railway branch line extending into the mining area is also under intense construction. After these projects are completed, the coal produced here will not only meet local needs, but also greatly support the industrial construction of neighboring provinces.

On this oasis centered on Hami, the Hami melon has been famous throughout the country since ancient times. At present, members of the people's communes are braving the wind and snow to reclaim wasteland, accumulate fertilizer, and carry out large-scale water conservancy construction. They plan to expand the cultivated area by 110,000 mu in 1960. In addition to increasing the production of grain and vegetables for the rapidly growing urban population, they will also plant more Hami melons, which will be transported by train to all parts of the country.

    新疆东部重镇——哈密
    新华社记者　王安
    火车驶过了千里河西走廊，再搭汽车穿过几百里人烟稀少的戈壁沙漠，就到了泉水淙淙，园林成荫的哈密。哈密是新疆东部的重镇，是戈壁沙漠里的一粒晶莹的珍珠。
    几次寒潮，已使它复盖上一层厚厚的白雪，气温降到零下二十度左右。但是，这里却仿佛没有冬天，到处是一片热气腾腾的建设景象。城外，田野里红旗招展，水利工地上忙个不停。进入市区，马路两旁新修起的房屋附近，到处都堆积着砖瓦木石等建筑材料。长鸣着汽笛的火车在这里卸下一列列支援边疆建设的器材，又从这里装上石油、木材、天然碱和各种土产特产运往内地。白天车马喧腾，入夜灯火辉煌。兰新铁路的通车，像东来的春风，吹得哈密的建设花朵更加万紫千红，生机无限。千年古城正在一日千里地发展成为新兴的工业城市。
    一个土生土长的哈密人，当他离家一年之后，今天又回到这里，也会一时辨不清方向。一年多以前，哈密城里聚居着汉、回、维吾尔、哈萨克等十三个民族一万多人，今天已有十万人了。一年多来，哈密新建房屋面积有二十五万多平方米，等于好几个旧哈密城的房屋建筑面积。早先被叫做北沙窝的城北，原是一片沙丘，只有几户人家零落地散布在沙丘边缘。现在，这里已开拓出一条七公里长三十二米宽的大马路，直通火车站。马路两旁竖起了哈密剧院、哈密饭店、邮电大楼等许多高大楼房，出现了商店、仓库、工厂等崭新的建筑群，成为新市区的中心。1959年哈密仅新建的饭店、旅社就有十一处，加上原有的已能供应七千人食宿，差不多能容纳解放初期全城的人口。现在还有许多新房正在修建，高高的脚手架上，戴着皮帽子的工人，正在紧张地工作。
    1958年以前，哈密的建筑工人还不到三百名，现在将近六千人了。但是，还远远不能满足目前冬季施工的需要。新市区西面，以火车站为中心，出现了一个新兴工业基地的雏形。高大的厂房，烟囱一个接着一个。尖尖墩原来是芦苇丛生、野狼出没的乱坟岗子，现在这里已经建起了现代化的钢铁、发电、机械、水泥、面粉和铁路附属工厂等二十多座工厂。哈密钢铁厂正在一边生产一边基建。在它的旁边，一座新发电厂的主厂房，烟囱刚刚落成，工人们正在积极准备安装汽轮发电机组。一年来，哈密的电力已经增加了将近十倍，等于解放前的三百八十倍，而这个新电厂投入生产后，仅一台机组发出的电，就比现在全市的电力还多。从尖尖墩继续西行，就进入三道岭煤矿区。早先这里只有几户人家，现在已有七千人。新建成的一对年产四十五万吨的机械化煤井，刚投入生产，另一对同样大的矿井和一处产量更大的露天煤矿又准备动工了。一条伸入矿区的铁路支线也正在紧张施工。这些工程完成后，这里出产的煤不仅满足当地需要，还可以大量支援邻省工业建设。
    以哈密为中心的这片绿洲上，自古以来就因产哈密瓜名闻全国。目前，各人民公社社员正冒着风雪严寒，开荒、积肥和大修水利，他们计划1960年扩大耕地面积十一万亩，除了为急速增长的城市人口增产粮食、蔬菜外，还要种植更多的哈密瓜，通过火车运往全国各地。（附图片）
