Lofty Ambitions Soaring to the Heavens
    Jing Yu
    The "building block" machine tools boldly created by the workers of the Harbin Machine Tool Joint Factory have been around for less than two years, but they are now very different from what they were a year ago. The times are leaping forward, production is leaping forward, people's thinking is leaping forward, and the "building block" machine tools have also made great leaps.
    If, a year ago, the machine tools seen by people in this small factory in Harbin were cobbled together and looked unsophisticated; then today, if you go to Harbin and take a look, it is no longer unsophisticated, but something "foreign," or something relatively "foreign." Its structural design is more scientific than in the past, and its application range is more extensive than in the past.
    What thoughts might arise from seeing this change?
    Thought one: Homegrown things should not be underestimated. Without the "native building block" machine tools of 1958, where would today's "foreign building block" machine tools come from? Isn't it an irrefutable truth that "native" can give rise to "foreign"? The fact that "building block" machine tools have begun to enter the ranks of modern machine tools is another vivid example. It must be recognized that homegrown things have their own special advantages, advantages that large foreign tools cannot replace. China's machinery industry needs to be equipped with modern machines, and at the same time, it must give full play to the advantages of homegrown things. All "foreign" things are improved from "native" things. In order to develop production, it is necessary to develop the productive forces and develop science and technology. And to develop the productive forces, it is necessary to start with reforming the means of production. Therefore, do not reject "native" in favor of "foreign."
    Thought two: The more liberated the thinking, the wider the road to innovation. The teachers and students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Harbin University of Technology, in order to further improve "building block" machine tools, liberated their thinking and moved forward on a broad path. The four research topics they planned are very encouraging. These four topics are:
    First, create large "building block" machine tools to equip China's heavy processing workshops or factories;
    Second, create small "building block" machine tools to meet the needs of China's vast rural areas;
    Third, create medium and small "building block" machine tools to rationally equip mass-produced mechanical processing workshops;
    Fourth, create "building block" machine tools suitable for mass production, and use "building block" machine tools to equip production automation lines, and promote the development of production automation lines.
    Obviously, technological innovation is endless. The more liberated the thinking, the wider the road to innovation; the more closed the thinking, the narrower the road to innovation. Roads are made by people. Many advanced elements have opened up the road to technological innovation. If we advance bravely along this road, we can move like the wind and travel thousands of miles a day.
    Thought three: Scientific research work must be combined with technological revolution in production and resolutely serve production. Scientific research cannot be separated from technological revolution. This is not only because the technological revolution is an important guarantee for continuous leaps in production and is also the political task of the proletariat, but also because the mass technological revolution movement is an inexhaustible source for the development of science and technology. If we want the cause of science to take root in the mass technological revolution movement, we must think of ways to take root. Implementing the combination of professional science and technology and the mass technological revolution movement is one way; implementing the combination of leading personnel, technical personnel, and the masses is another way; implementing the combination of various grassroots production units and the teaching and research of institutions of higher learning is also a way. The combination of these methods will promote the technological revolution movement to rise step by step and promote the continuous great leap forward of the entire socialist construction cause.
    "Building block" machine tools are a new thing that emerged in the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Like all other new things, it was born with people's lofty ambitions and developed with people's lofty ambitions. Gorky said, "There is no other creative power in the world except man's will and reason." Look, people's lofty ambitions soar to the heavens, and all new things must have a bright future.

    壮志凌云冲斗牛
    静宇
    哈尔滨机联厂的工人们大胆创制的“积木式”机床到现在不到两年，可是，现在同一年前已经大不相同了。时代在大跃进，生产在大跃进，人们的思想在大跃进，而“积木式”机床也有了很大的跃进。
    如果说，一年以前，人们在哈尔滨这家小厂看到的那种机床是拼拼凑凑、土里土气的东西；那么，今天，你再去哈尔滨看一下，它已经不是土里土气的东西，而是属于“洋”的东西，或者是属于比较“洋”的东西了。它的结构定型比过去更加科学了，它的应用范围比过去更加广泛了。
    看了这个变化会引起一些什么感想呢？
    感想之一：土生土长，不可小视。没有1958年的那种“土积木式”机床，哪有今天的“洋积木式”机床？“土”中可以出“洋”，难道不是颠扑不破的真理吗？“积木式”机床开始登入了现代化机床的行列，就是又一个鲜明的例子。必须看到，土生土长的东西有它特殊的优越性，有着大洋工具不能代替的优越性。我国的机械工业需要现代化的机器装备起来，同时也要发挥土生土长的优越性。一切“洋”东西都是从“土”东西改进而来的。为了发展生产，就要发展生产力，发展科学技术。而发展生产力，就要从改革生产工具着手。因此，切勿非“土”厚“洋”。
    感想之二：思想越解放，革新的路子就越宽广。哈尔滨工业大学机械系的老师和同学们为了进一步提高“积木式”机床，解放了思想，在宽广的道上前进，他们规划的四个研究题目，十分鼓舞人心。这四个题目是：
    第一、创制大型“积木式”机床，装备我国的重型加工车间或工厂；
    第二、创制小型“积木式”机床，满足我国广大农村需要；
    第三、创制中小型“积木式”机床，合理地装备成批生产的机械加工车间；
    第四、创造适应于大量生产的“积木式”机床，并且用“积木式”机床来装备生产自动线，推进生产自动线的发展。
    很明显，技术革新是永无止境的。思想解放了，革新的路子就越走越宽，思想闭塞了，革新的路子就越走越窄。路是人走出来的，许多先进分子开拓了技术革新的大道，沿着这条大道奋勇前进，就可以健步如飞，日行千里。
    感想之三：科学研究工作必须同生产上的技术革命结合起来，坚决为生产服务。科学研究离不开技术革命。这不仅仅是因为技术革命是生产连续跃进的重要保证，而且是无产阶级的政治任务，群众性的技术革命运动是发展科学技术的无尽泉源。如果想要科学事业在群众性的技术革命运动中扎根，那就得想扎根的办法。实行专业科学技术和群众技术革命运动相结合，是一个办法；实行领导人员、技术人员和群众相结合，又是一个办法；实行各生产基层单位跟高等院校的教学研究相结合，也是一个办法。这些办法，相互结合就促使技术革命运动步步高涨，促进整个社会主义建设事业连续大跃进。
    “积木式”机床是1958年大跃进中的新生事物。它同其他一切新生事物一样，随着人们的雄心壮志而诞生，又随着人们的雄心壮志而发展。高尔基说过，“世界上除开了人的意志和理智没有别的创造力量”。看，人们的壮志凌云，气冲斗牛，一切新生事物必然是万里鹏程，前途无量。
