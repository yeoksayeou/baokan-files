    Closely Cooperating with Relevant Departments to Train More Technical Personnel:
    Tsinghua Evening University is Doing Well
    (Our Dispatch) The Chinese Communist Party Committee of Tsinghua University, in order to train more professional and technical cadres, while running a full-time university well, has utilized the school's teaching potential and persisted in developing the spare-time evening university for the past four years.
    Over the past four years, the number of evening university students has been continuously increasing, and the majors have also been gradually increasing. In addition to the technical personnel and cadres of central industrial departments, the student composition also includes industrial workers. Among the freshmen admitted last summer vacation, the proportion of industrial workers accounted for more than 16%, including machinists, electricians, line workers, and stoker workers. Now there are more than 700 students in all grades of the evening university, an increase of eight times compared to when it was first opened. They come from 150 factories, institutions, schools, and other enterprises in Beijing. Last autumn, the evening university already had fifth-year students. Within five years, students, through the study of basic theory courses, professional courses, and experiments, and through productive labor, have basically reached the level of university graduates.
    When this evening university was first established, it only had three majors: "Thermal Power Plant," "Power Plant Power Grid Power System," and "Hydraulic Structure"; now it has developed to have six majors including "Mechanical Manufacturing Technology," "Radio Technology," and "Industrial and Civil Architecture." There are more than 30 teachers lecturing here, many of whom are experienced teachers, such as Zhao Fangxiong, director of the Mathematics Teaching and Research Group, and Chu Zhongrui, director of the Surveying Teaching and Research Group.
    An important reason why the evening university has been able to develop rapidly is the close cooperation with the co-organizing departments—the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power. They jointly formulated the teaching policy of the evening university: to cultivate professional and technical cadres with a firm working-class stance, who are both red and expert, and who combine physical and mental labor in an all-round way; and gradually increased various majors according to the needs of industrial construction and the existing conditions of Tsinghua University. The study time and participation in labor and other systems of the students were also formulated after careful consultation with the units to which the students belonged, with the help of the co-organizing departments. The evening university also regularly learns about the work, study, and ideological situation of the students from various units, and asks the Party and League organizations of these units to cooperate in conducting ideological education for the students. The evening university often pays attention to coordinating teaching activities with the political movements and work of various units. The co-organizing departments have also transferred more than ten cadres to serve as full-time teachers at the evening university.
    The evening university has taken necessary measures according to various different situations to create conditions for students to study. Most of the students studying here are busy with work and have high mobility. The evening university has taken many measures based on this situation. If students are on business trips for a long time, they are introduced to local evening universities to audit courses; for short-term trips, they can study on their own through lecture notes. After these students return, the teachers also give them make-up lessons. During political movements, in addition to planning to slow down the teaching progress so that students have enough time to participate in the political movements of their units, the evening school department also conducts political and ideological education for students in conjunction with the movements. During the education revolution in 1958, the school department organized students to launch a debate on educational policies and the "red and expert" path, helping students establish a correct learning attitude and improve their enthusiasm for learning. The time students participate in productive labor is the same as that stipulated by the units where the students work, and they go to factories and construction sites to work according to their different jobs and majors. Students majoring in hydraulic structures have gone to the Sanmenxia construction site to work. Fourth-year students majoring in thermal power plants have gone to the Beijing Repair and Manufacturing Plant of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power to participate in the disassembly and assembly of steam turbines.
    Students participating in evening university studies, especially Communist Party members and workers, have demonstrated a tenacious will to storm the fortress of science and technology. Young worker Yu Wensheng, who has seven years of work experience, etc., lives near Xiangshan, which is far from the school. They have to travel forty miles back and forth for each class, but they still persist in studying. Fifth-year student Ma Guisheng (Communist Party member), although he is often on business trips, can still complete his homework in a timely manner, and his academic performance has always been very good. The units where the students work also often care about and encourage their studies. (Zhou Jianying)

### 和有关部门紧密协作　培养更多的技术人材  清华业余夜大学办得好

    和有关部门紧密协作　培养更多的技术人材
    清华业余夜大学办得好
    本报讯　中共清华大学党委会，为培养更多的专业技术干部，在办好全日制大学的同时，发挥学校教学潜力，四年来坚持并发展了业余夜大学。
    四年来夜大学的学生不断地增长，专业也在逐渐增加。学生成分除了中央工业部门的技术人员和干部外，还有产业工人。去年暑假录取的新生中，产业工人的比例占16％以上，其中有机工、电工、线路工人和司炉工人等。现在夜大学各年级已经有七百多名学生，比刚开办时增长了八倍。他们来自北京的一百五十个工厂、机关、学校和其他企业单位。去年秋天，夜大学已经有了五年级学生。在五年内，学生通过基础理论课、专业课的学习和实验，并通过生产劳动，基本上达到了大学毕业的水平。
    这个夜大学刚成立时，仅有“热能动力装置”、“发电厂电力网电力系统”和“水工结构”三个专业；现在已发展到具有“机械制造工艺”、“无线电技术”、“工业与民用建筑”等六个专业。在这里讲课的教师有三十多位，其中有很多有经验的教师，如数学教研组主任赵访熊，测量教研组主任储钟瑞等。
    夜大学所以能够迅速发展的一个重要原因，是与合办部门——第一机械工业部、水利电力部的紧密协作。他们共同制定了夜大学的教学方针：培养有坚定的工人阶级立场，又红又专，体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合的全面发展的专业技术干部；并且根据工业建设需要和清华大学现有条件，逐步增设了各专业。关于学员的学习时间，参加劳动等制度，也是在合办部门帮助下，和学员所属的各单位进行细致协商后制定的。夜大学还定期向各单位了解学员的工作、学习和思想情况，请这些单位党和团的组织，协同向学员进行思想教育。夜大学经常注意配合各单位的政治运动和工作进行教学活动。合办部门还抽调了十多名干部，来担任夜大学的专职教师。
    夜大学根据各种不同情况，采取了必要的措施，为学生创造学习的条件。在这里学习的学生，大都工作忙流动性大，夜大学根据这一情况，采取了许多措施。学生出差时间较长的，就介绍他们到当地夜大学去借读；短期的可通过讲义进行自学。这些学生回来后，教师还给他们补课。政治运动期间，夜校部除了一方面有计划地放缓教学进度，让学生有充分时间参加本单位的政治运动以外，还结合运动，对学生进行政治思想教育。在1958年教育革命中，校部就组织学生展开了教育方针和“红专”道路的辩论，帮助学生树立了正确的学习态度，提高了学习积极性。学生参加生产劳动的时间和学员所在单位规定的相同，并依据学生不同的工作和所学专业，到工厂、工地去劳动。水工结构专业的学生，就曾到三门峡工地去劳动。热能动力装置专业四年级的学生，曾到水利电力部北京修造厂，参加了汽轮机的拆装工作。
    参加夜大学学习的学生，特别是共产党员和工人，表现了攻夺科学技术堡垒的顽强意志。具有七年工龄的青年工人喻文胜等，住在香山附近，离学校较远，每次上课都要往返四十里路，但他们仍然坚持了学习。五年级学生马桂生（共产党员）虽然经常出差，但是仍能及时完成作业，学习成绩一直很好。学生所在的工作单位，也经常关心和鼓励他们的学习。　（周建英）
