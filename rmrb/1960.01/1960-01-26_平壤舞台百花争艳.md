On the Pyongyang stage in the new year of 1960, a flourishing scene of diverse artistic expressions is presented. The artists of North Korea, who have gone further into the masses and into reality in the "Chollima" Movement, are using their ardent enthusiasm to sing the praises of this Chollima era.

From January 7th, the Korean National Folk Art Theater performed the newly compiled dance drama "New Departure," followed by new programs such as the opera "Zhao Yu Ji" and the dance drama "Hometown."

The three-act grand dance drama "New Departure" depicts the enthusiastic labor scene of young people building water conservancy projects, as well as their struggle against counter-revolutionary elements who sabotage construction. Using the form of dance drama to express the labor life of workers and peasants is a new development in Korean dance art in recent years. Last year, young dancer Jiang Yucai created the dance drama "Red Heart" which expressed the steelmaking of steel workers, and the performance of "New Departure" is another new achievement in this regard.

The opera "Zhao Yu Ji" tells the story of Zhao Yu Ji, a Korean patriotic martyr and labor party member, who heroically and unyieldingly sacrificed herself after being arrested by the U.S. military. Korean classical opera – Changju – which has a long history, used to perform historical stories such as "The Tale of Chunhyang" and "The Tale of Shim Cheong." The artists of the Korean National Folk Art Theater are working hard to develop Changju art so that it can express modern themes. Pyongyang's drama scene is also very active, with the new play "Brothers" and the repertory play "Immortal Bird" being performed around the New Year. The performance of the play "Brothers," adapted from the novel of the same name created last year by the old writer Han Xueye, has been warmly welcomed. This play reflects the ardent patriotism and noble style of communists of the Korean people through the story of the family of the national musician Nan Zhen.

    平壤舞台百花争艳
    1960年的新春，平壤舞台上呈现出百花争艳一片繁荣景象。在“千里马”运动中进一步深入群众、深入实际的朝鲜的艺术家们，正以他们炽烈的热情来歌颂这个千里马的时代。
    从1月7日起，朝鲜国立民族艺术剧场演出新编舞剧“新出发”，接着还有唱剧“造玉姬”和舞剧“乡土”等新节目上演。
    三幕大型舞剧“新出发”，表现了青年们兴修水利的热火朝天的劳动场面，以及他们同破坏建设的反革命分子斗争的情形。用舞剧的形式来表现工人农民的劳动生活，是朝鲜的舞蹈艺术近年来的一个新发展，去年年青舞蹈家江玉采曾创作了表现炼钢工人炼钢的舞剧“红心”，“新出发”的演出是这方面的又一个新的收获。
    唱剧“造玉姬”是表现朝鲜爱国烈士、劳动党员造玉姬在被美军逮捕后英勇不屈壮烈牺牲的故事的。有悠久历史的朝鲜的古典戏曲——唱剧过去上演的节目都是“春香传”、“沈清传”等历史故事。朝鲜国立民族艺术剧场的艺术家们正在努力发展唱剧艺术，使它能够表现现代主题。平壤的话剧也很活跃，新年前后演出了新剧目“兄弟”和保留剧目“不死鸟”。根据老作家韩雪野去年创作的同名小说改编的话剧“兄弟”的演出，受到了热烈的欢迎。这个话剧通过民族音乐家南镇的一家的故事，反映了朝鲜人民的热烈的爱国主义感情和共产主义者的高尚风格。
