The Shanghai Instrument Research Institute has successfully trial-produced a pneumatic unit combination instrument. This is a state-of-the-art instrument possessing a complete set of various regulating instruments.

In the past, due to different production methods in various industries, the required instruments were also different. For example, instruments used in the petroleum industry could not be used in the chemical industry. The pneumatic unit combination instrument combines many instruments that perform functions such as regulation, calculation, indication, and recording. When used, it can be slightly adjusted according to different production objects to form instruments for various purposes. Nowadays, most instruments use electricity as power, which is prone to explosions, while this instrument uses compressed air as power, making it suitable for the needs of explosion-proof sites in petroleum, chemical and other industries. Our own domestically manufactured thermal instrument control panel and various instruments installed on the control panel. Currently, this product is being mass-produced and is gradually developing towards a higher level of precision.

    成套的仪表
    上海仪表研究所试制成功一种气动单元组合仪表。这是一种最新型的、具有一整套各种调节仪器的仪表。
    过去由于各种行业的生产方法不同，需用的仪表也不相同，例如石油工业生产用的仪表，就不能用于化学工业。气动单元组合仪表，是把许多起调节、计算、指示、记录等作用的仪表组合在一起，使用的时候，可以根据不同的生产对象，稍加调节，组成各种用途的仪表。现在一般仪表都要用电做动力，容易发生爆炸，而这种仪表是用压缩空气作动力，因此适用于石油、化工等防爆场的需要。我国自己制造的热工仪表控制盘和控制盘上安装的各种仪表。目前这种产品正在大量生产，并且逐步向高级精密的方向发展。
