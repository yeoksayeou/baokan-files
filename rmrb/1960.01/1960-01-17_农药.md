    Pesticides
    Crops can also get sick and be harmed by insects. In order to prevent and control agricultural pests and diseases, people have researched and developed pesticides with various characteristics and functions. For example, there are insecticides and acaricides (red spider mites) to control pests; fungicides to control plant diseases; rodenticides to control field mice; herbicides to control weeds; and plant growth stimulants to prevent cotton boll shedding, promote early ripening of apples, and stimulate the growth of other plants.
    In addition to different control ranges, pesticides also have many special functions. For example, the insecticide "1059" can be absorbed into the plant, and insects that eat the seedlings that have absorbed the poison will be poisoned to death. Some pesticides, such as "K-6451," can kill insect eggs, and insects can be killed before they hatch. The herbicide "2,4,5-T" is specifically for killing dicotyledonous weeds. When this medicine is sprinkled on the ground, it will kill all dicotyledonous weeds, while the seedlings will not be harmed at all. "Aipi Xi" is specifically for killing monocotyledonous weeds. "Tetrachloronitrobenzene" can inhibit potato sprouting, making it easier to store. Tomatoes sprayed with "Naphthalene Acetic Acid" can bear seedless fruit. "Calcium cyanamide" can cause cotton leaves to fall off, making it easier to harvest with tractors. There is also an insecticide that can kill pests but will not harm bees. Trichlorfon is also a good insecticide and is less toxic to humans and animals. There are many interesting pesticides like these.
    At present, there are more than one hundred kinds of the most important chemical pesticides, and my country can produce dozens of them. Many important chemical pesticides can be produced domestically, which has greatly supported agriculture.

    农药
    农作物也会生病和受到虫害，为了防治农业病虫害，人们研究出具有各种不同特点和作用的农药。例如防治害虫的有杀虫剂和杀螨（红蜘蛛）剂；防治植物病害的有杀菌剂；防治地老鼠的有杀鼠剂；防除杂草的有除草剂；防治棉花落铃、促进苹果早熟和其他植物生长的有植物生长刺激素。
    农药除了防治范围不同以外，还有很多特殊的功能，如杀虫剂“1059”它可以被植物吸收到体内，虫子吃了吸收毒药的禾苗就会被毒死。有的农药如“K—6451”可以杀虫卵，虫子在没有孵化以前就能被杀死。除草剂“2．4．5—涕”是专门除双子叶草的，把这种药撒到地里，就会把双子叶的草全部杀死，而禾苗一点都不会受到损害。“爱皮西”则专门杀单子叶杂草。“四氯硝基苯”可以抑制土豆发芽，便于保存。西红柿喷过“萘乙酸”以后，可以结出无子的果实。“石灰氮”可以叫棉花落叶，便于用拖拉机收割。还有一种杀虫药，它能杀死害虫，却不会杀害蜜蜂。敌百虫也是很好的杀虫药，而对人畜毒害很小。像这样有趣味的农药是很多的。
    现在最重要的化学农药共有一百多种，我国自己能生产的农药就有几十种之多，有很多重要化学农药都可以自己生产，这对支援农业起了很大作用。
