New Year's Song
Xu Chi

The night shift workers cheered, the night communes cheered, the midnight bells rang, the New Year, 1960, arrived.
Celebration swept across the land, songs of the Great Leap Forward surged like roaring waves. Life galloped across the grasslands like a steed. A new era, the second decade, has arrived.
Thousands upon thousands of advanced collectives are exceeding their quotas and completing their plans ahead of schedule.
Out with the old, in with the new, songs of triumph spread everywhere.
The heroic cities, the heroic people have already entered 1960!
Goodbye, to the years gone by! Looking back, what great achievements and meritorious deeds!
Great Leap Forward! Brand new years, ahead of us is a surging, tumultuous high tide.
The enthusiasm of the New China's people is more powerful than atomic energy.
The time of the New China's people is churning like golden waves.
A people's commune in North China will begin cultivating an orchard in the New Year, a top-notch one in all of China.
All of China's people's communes will build a great granary in the new era, a top-notch one in all the world.
More steel factories will rise on the horizon, more oil derricks will stand tall among the clouds.
Boats and rafts will sail across more mountain valleys and reservoirs, more trains will speed and circle up to the plateaus.
The honey of life will be even sweeter, the silks and satins even more vibrant.
In the new era, in the New Year, more ideals will be realized.
The capital, so magnificent, so beautiful, welcomes the New Year with a renewed spirit.
China, so strong, so prosperous, continues to leap forward in the New Year.
Look, the red flag waves before the people of the world,
Our red flag is inscribed with: "Socialism—Communism."

    迎新曲
    徐迟夜班工人欢呼了，夜晚的公社欢呼了，子夜的钟声敲响了，新年，1960年，来了。五湖四海一片欢腾，跃进歌声，波涛喧天，生活像骏马奔驰草原，来到的是新的年代，第二个十年。先进集体千千万，任务超额，计划提前，除旧迎新，凯歌传遍，英雄的城市，英雄的人民早已进入了1960年！再见了，逝去的岁月，回顾过去，多少伟绩丰功！跃进呵！崭新的岁月，迎面是高潮澎湃汹涌。新中国人民的干劲比原子能威力更雄壮，新中国人民的光阴，翻滚着黄金般的波浪。华北有个人民公社要在新的一年里，开始培育一个花果园，在全中国也数一数二。全中国的人民公社要在新的年代里建设起一座大粮仓，在全世界也数一数二。更多钢铁工厂要升上地平线，更多石油铁塔要高插云霄间，船筏要驶过更多的山谷水库，更多列车要飞速盘旋上高原。生活的蜜汁将更甜，绫罗绸缎更鲜艳，在新的年代，新的一年里，更多的理想要实现。首都，又宏伟，又美丽，迎接新年，气象更新。中国，又刚强，又繁华，在新年里继续跃进。看呵，红旗招展在全世界人民面前，我们的红旗上写着：“社会主义——共产主义。”
