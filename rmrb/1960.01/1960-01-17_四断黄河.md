Four Times Blocking the Yellow River

Our reporter Liu Bang

To block the Yellow River, a river that rushes down from the sky and surges across thousands of miles, is not a first for the new China. But who has ever seen a project as clean and efficient as the Liujiaxia damming, which only took seven hours from start to finish!

        The Battle Begins

Just as the clock struck midnight on New Year's Day 1960, a thunderous explosion echoed across Liujiaxia. More than four thousand cubic meters of rock blocking the entrance of the diversion tunnel were blasted away, and the battle to block the river began. Ice floes surged mightily, pouring from the mountains of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau into the steep cliffs of Liujiaxia. Suddenly, millions of cubic meters of rockfill, pre-positioned here, were dumped like a torrential downpour from both banks towards the Yellow River, creating spur dikes and blocking the river's swift current. The Yellow River, in a frenzy, rolled, roared, and whipped up gigantic waves, crashing against the banks and the spur dikes. The canyon, several kilometers long, was instantly filled with rolling dust and flying spray… In these tense moments, facing the menacing waves, the people on the construction site did not throw in millions of concrete tetrahedrons and wire mesh cages, which had always been considered indispensable for damming, but millions of hearts filled with the determination to build socialism at high speed. In the "dragon's mouth," where the waves broke against the spur dike and stirred up mountains of white foam, the water head jumped several yards high, and rocks weighing several tons were tossed into the water, immediately swept away by the vortex like floating ice. But the shock troops active on the front line were all brave. The people on the artificial loading platforms loaded five cubic meters of rockfill onto trucks in just twenty seconds, turning the two-kilometer-long damming road into a giant rockfill conveyor belt, accelerating the rate at which rocks were dumped into the water to once per minute per truck.

At 9:50 AM on New Year's Day 1960, Zhang Yuefeng, a heroic driver from Sanmenxia, shoved the last truckload of rockfill into the "dragon's mouth," and the roaring Yellow River gasped. Liujiaxia was dammed. The neck of this giant, whose head rested on the Bayan Har Mountains and feet touched the East Sea, was forcibly cut off, and the river water obediently flowed downstream through the diversion tunnel, exposing the riverbed that had not seen sunlight for thousands of years!

Heroic Courage and Wisdom

The Liujiaxia damming is a red flag for pushing the construction cause forward at high speed, a red flag for achieving victory in the struggle against nature and backward thinking. In the days of construction, people faced not only the Yellow River's raging waves, but also various forms of right-leaning ideology.

In September 1958, the first explosions to break ground at Liujiaxia reverberated. From that time on, the struggle between the two lines of "more, faster, better, and more economical" versus "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" rose and fell like the waves of the Yellow River, clashing against each other. The excavation of the diversion tunnel was the "initial contact" in this struggle.

The Liujiaxia diversion tunnel was as high as a four-story building and wide enough to accommodate three parallel trains. The excavated rocks could fill 190,000 Liberation brand trucks, an unprecedented project in China's water conservancy engineering. Faced with this project, the vast number of cadres and workers felt extremely excited and honored. However, some people with serious right-leaning ideas succumbed to the Yellow River. They complained, arguing that a large amount of modern machinery and equipment was needed to complete this tunnel. According to their plan, even if all the mechanical equipment at the Liujiaxia construction site was concentrated, it would still be less than one-third of the required quantity. What to do? Advance or retreat? The struggle unfolded from this matter.

The Party educated the workers: "Indigenous methods first, diversification of methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, gradually mechanizing." Without ventilators, the pilot tunnel was first opened, using natural ventilation; lacking trucks, manual carts were used to transport the rockfill. If there were large machines, large machines were used; if there were no large machines, small machines were used; if there were no small machines, manual labor was used. As a result, the diversion tunnel, which usually takes four to five years to complete in some capitalist countries, was completed in just one year and three months. The victory in building the diversion tunnel kicked away the first stumbling block placed by right-leaning thought on the construction road.

The "Thousand vs. Five Hundred" Dispute

Despite the victory in the construction of the diversion tunnel project, which greatly educated and encouraged the construction enthusiasm of the vast number of workers, people with right-leaning ideas were not willing to give up. A "thousand vs. five hundred" dispute immediately followed.

In August of last year, when the issues of when and how to block the river were put on the agenda, people with right-leaning conservative ideas consulted a large number of domestic and foreign hydropower station damming materials, but disregarding the actual water conditions at the time and place, they actually used a flow rate of one thousand cubic meters per second, which occurs once in ten years during the Yellow River's dry season, as the basis for the Liujiaxia damming design. According to this plan, all the twenty-five-ton trucks in the national water conservancy and electric power system would not be enough for the Liujiaxia damming, and self-unloading trucks, flatbed tractors, etc., would have to be brought in…

Under the domination of this thinking, they put forward a plan. According to the equipment listed in their plan, damming preparations could not be advanced.

However, socialist construction must win time and speed. The Party organizations and workers at the construction site all understood this. The factory clusters in Lanzhou, like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, urgently needed power, the families of people's commune members were waiting for bright electric lights, and the people's belief in conquering the Yellow River was unstoppable.

The Party is an old helmsman who has experienced political storms, and the people hoped that the Party would make a wise decision on this. The Liujiaxia Hydropower Engineering Bureau Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, grasping the situation that the rainfall in the 72,000 square kilometers upstream of Liujiaxia on the Yellow River this year was not high, and based on the favorable situation of the early appearance of the dry season of the Yellow River this year, referring to the results of the damming model test at the construction site, extensively mobilized the masses to conduct in-depth discussions, criticized and overturned this damming plan that violated the spirit of the general line; and proposed a fighting slogan: "Emancipate the mind, scientifically calculate, clarify the cross-section, select a good plan, fully prepare, fight hard and skillfully, achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, and win in one go." On this basis, a new plan that conformed to objective reality, was actively rational and economical, and used 500 cubic meters per second as the design flow for damming was born. The project cost of this new plan was only one-ninth of the original plan, it could dispense with twenty-five-ton trucks, etc., manpower could not be increased, a total of 850,000 yuan could be saved for the country, and time could be gained to advance the damming. More importantly, this new plan truly embodied the spirit of the Party's general line, it cleared away the "fear of the Yellow River" and the mystery that "damming the Yellow River is the cutting edge of water conservancy engineering" that had been left in people's minds for thousands of years!

When this new plan was put forward at the enlarged meeting of the Engineering Bureau Party Committee on September 28th, the Yellow River's flow rate had already dropped below 1,000 cubic meters per second, and the workers greeted the new plan with joy and excitement. But some people with right-leaning conservative ideas actually arrogantly wanted to "bet" with the Bureau Party Committee, and some were waiting to see the Party fail. The workers were outraged. Everyone was determined to use heroic actions to conquer the Yellow River to counterattack those with right-leaning ideas. This is the answer to why every ordinary worker is a fearless hero in the face of raging waves, and every ordinary stone becomes an irresistible force to subdue the Yellow River.

Dare to Win, Must Win

In the winter night of Liujiaxia, the north wind cuts through the bones, the smoke and fog are hazy, and the canyon is filled with a profound blackness. At this time, lights all over the mountains and plains replace the stars in twinkling, and the roaring of the vehicles rushing back and forth awakens the silent night sky. The heroes taming the river greeted the dawn of 1960 with battle, and the "dragon's mouth" shock troops, wearing red flowers on their chests and life jackets around their waists, were all carefully selected strong young men. Wang Ding, who grew up sucking the milk of the Yellow River, had twice the passion for curing the Yellow River. Those who participated in the cofferdam project at the inlet knew how he risked his life on the Yellow River as if it were nothing. The cofferdam was a temporary measure in front of the diversion tunnel inlet, and without it the inlet project could not be carried out. Wang Ding led the workers to travel back and forth more than 130 li through wind and snow, carrying 800,000 jin of wheat straw to the construction site; led the workers to cut down half a mountain of loess and slide it to the bank; and led the workers to block the Yellow River's swift current with grass and soil in front of the inlet with a flow rate of more than 500 cubic meters per second, a water depth of more than seven meters, and a riverbed slope of one to one. When the eighty-meter-long cofferdam was about to close, he was riding near the dragon's mouth, concentrating on filling the soil, when the Yellow River raged! A huge wave tore a gap in the cofferdam next to Wang Ding – a dragon glaring and opening its mouth, about to devour people! In an instant, his life hung by a thread, but his expression did not change, and he decisively issued an order: "Fill the soil quickly!" The cofferdam stabilized, and Wang Ding told his companions: "The Yellow River, you have to beat it to the end. If you dare to win! You will definitely be able to win!"

How many Wang Dings are there on the construction site! After the Party Committee put forward another inspiring new damming plan and mobilized the masses, the workload completed in fifty days was equivalent to the past one hundred and thirty-one days.

The Liujiaxia key project has successfully passed the damming stage. The heroes taming the river are taking advantage of the victory to launch the main project of the Liujiaxia water conservancy hub. The people of Liujiaxia are laughing with joy for the successful damming. (Attached picture)

The Liujiaxia Hydropower Station project combines indigenous and foreign methods, and is progressing rapidly. The picture shows the situation of mobilizing the masses to use indigenous methods to collect sand and gravel.

    四断黄河
    本报记者　柳梆
    把落天走海、暴泻千里的黄河拦腰斩断，在新中国已经不是第一次了。但是，谁见过像刘家峡截流工程这样干净利索，前后只用了七个小时！
        战斗开始了
    1960年元旦的钟声刚刚响过，震天动地的爆炸声出现在刘家峡。堵在导流隧洞进水口的四千多方石头被炸掉了，截流的战斗开始了。冰凌浩浩荡荡，从青藏高原的群山间倾入峭壁陡崖的刘家峡，突然，预先埋伏在这里的千万方石碴，如急风骤雨，从两岸向黄河猛泻，浮起戗堤，挡住了黄河急流的去路。黄河，暴跳着，翻滚着，呼啸着，掀起巨浪，猛扑两岸和戗堤。几公里长的峡谷，顿时烟尘滚滚，飞沫迸溅……。就在这紧张的一分一秒间，工地上的人们，面对着气势汹汹的惊涛骇浪，人们投进黄河的不是千万块历来被认为截流必不可少的混凝土四面体和铅丝笼，而是千万颗高速度进行社会主义建设的决心。在巨浪裂戗堤，卷起千堆雪的“龙口”，水头一蹦几丈高，几吨重的石块抛到水里，立刻像浮冰一样，被漩涡卷走了。但是，活跃在前沿阵地的突击队员个个浑身是胆。人工装料台上的人们，二十秒钟之间就把五立方石碴装到载重汽车上去，两公里长的截流公路变成一条巨型的石碴传送带，人们把倾泻到水里的石块加速到一分钟一次车。
    1960年元旦九时五十分钟，来自三门峡的英雄司机张岳峰把最后一车石碴塞进了“龙口”，咆哮的黄河喘息了，刘家峡断流了。这个头枕巴颜喀拉山、脚踏东海的巨人的脖子被强行掐断，河水驯顺地从导流隧洞下泄，腾出了几千年不见阳光的河床！
    英雄的虎胆和智慧
    刘家峡的截流，是一面人们把建设事业高速度推向前进的红旗，是一面向大自然、向落后思想斗争取得胜利的红旗。在建设的日子里，人们面对着不单是黄河的惊涛骇浪，还有形形色色的右倾思想。
    1958年9月间，刘家峡响起了第一阵开山炸石的炮声。从那时候起，多快好省和少慢差费两条路线之间的斗争，像黄河的波浪那样，时伏时起，互相撞击。开挖导流隧洞是这场斗争的“前哨接触”。
    导流隧洞是刘家峡的高可以盖四层楼房，宽可以并行三列火车，挖出来的石头可以装满十九万辆解放牌汽车，是我国水利工程中前所未有的工程。面对着这个工程，广大干部和工人群众感到无比兴奋和光荣。但是，一部分有着严重右倾思想的人却在黄河面前屈服了。他们叫苦，提出打通这个隧洞需要大量的近代化机械设备。依照他们的计划，把刘家峡工地所有的机械设备全部集中起来，还不到要求数量的三分之一。怎么办？前进还是后退？斗争从这件事情展开了。
    党教育职工们：“土法先上马，方法多样化，土洋相结合，逐步机械化”。没有通风机就先打通导洞，采用自然通风；缺乏汽车就用人工斗车出碴。有大机器用大机器，没有大机器用小机器，没有小机器用人工。结果，在一些资本主义国家里通常要花去四、五年时间才能竣工的导流隧洞，只用了一年零三个月就全部建成了。筑导流隧洞的胜利，踢开了右倾思想在建筑道路上安放的第一块绊脚石。
    “一千与五百”之争
    尽管导流隧洞工程建设的胜利，极大地教育和鼓舞了广大职工群众的建设热情，但是，有着右倾思想的人，还不服输。一场“一千与五百”之争，又紧接着开始了。
    去年8月间，当何时截流、怎样截流的问题提到议事日程上的时候，有右倾保守思想的人查阅了许多国内外水电站截流的资料，而不顾当时当地的实际水情，居然以黄河枯水期中十年一遇的一千秒公方流量作为刘家峡截流设计的依据。按照这个方案，全国水利电力系统所有的载重二十五吨的汽车还不够刘家峡截流用的，同时又要开出了自卸汽车、平板大拖拉车……
    在这种思想支配下，他们提出了一个方案。按照他们的方案开列的设备，截流准备工作是无法提前的。
    可是，社会主义建设一定要赢得时间和速度。建设工地上的党组织和工人都懂得这一点。兰州市犹如雨后春笋般的工厂群，迫切需要动力，人民公社社员的家庭在等待着明亮的电灯，人民征服黄河的信念不可遏止。
    党是久历政治风浪的老舵手，人民群众希望党对此作出英明的决定。中共刘家峡水电工程局委员会掌握到今年黄河刘家峡上游七万二千多平方公里降雨量不多的情况，根据今年黄河枯水期提前出现的有利形势，参照工地模型截流试验的成果，广泛发动群众深入讨论，批判并推翻这个违背总路线精神的截流方案；提出：“解放思想，科学推算，弄清断面，选择良案，充分准备，苦战巧干，多快好省，一鼓取胜”的战斗号召。在这个基础上，诞生了一个符合客观实际、积极合理经济、以五百秒公方作为截流设计流量的新方案。这个新方案的工程造价只为原方案的九分之一，可以不要载重二十五吨大汽车等等，人力可以不增加，总共可以为国家节约八十五万元，并且还能争取时间提前截流。更重要的是，这个新方案真正体现了党的总路线精神，它清除了几千年来遗留在人们心理上的黄河可畏的“恐黄病”和“在黄河截流是水利工程的尖端”的神秘感！
    当9月28日工程局党委扩大会上提出这个新方案的时候，黄河流量已经降到一千秒公方以下了，工人群众以欢欣鼓舞的心情迎接这个新方案。而有右倾保守思想的人，有人居然傲慢地要同局党委“打赌”，有人在等着瞧党的失败。工人群众怒不可遏了。大伙决心用征服黄河的英勇行动来回击有右倾思想的人。这就是我们看到的，为什么每一个普普通通的工人在惊涛骇浪面前都是无所畏惧的好汉，每一块平平常常的石头都变成慑服黄河的不可抗拒的力量的答案。
    敢胜利，就一定胜利
    冬夜的刘家峡，朔风透骨，烟雾迷蒙，峡谷里浮泛着深邃的黝黑。这时，满山遍野的灯光代替着繁星在闪烁，来往奔驰的车辆发出阵阵吼声，把寂静的夜空震醒，驯河的英雄们用战斗来迎接1960年的黎明，胸佩红花腰系救生衣的“龙口”突击队员，都是千挑百选出来的棒小伙子。吮吸着黄河乳汁长大的王丁，对于治好黄河更有着双倍的激情，参加过进水口草土围堰工程的人都知道他是怎样在黄河上历险如夷的。草土围堰是导流隧洞进水口前面的临时性措施，没有它进水口工程就不能进行。王丁领着工人冒着风雪连夜往返一百三十多里地，把八十万斤麦草背到工地；领着工人把半个山头的黄土劈下来溜到岸边；领着工人在流量五百多秒公方，水深七米多、河床坡度一比一的进水口跟前，用草和土挡住黄河的急流。当八十米长的围堰眼看就要合龙，他正骑在龙口附近聚精会神填土的时候，黄河暴怒了！一个巨浪就把王丁身边的围堰撕开一个裂口——蛟龙眦目张嘴，就要夺人而噬了！刹那间，他，生命系于一发而神色不变，斩钉截铁地下命令：“快填土”！围堰稳住了，王丁告诉同伴：“黄河嘛，你骑着他打，就得打到底。你敢胜利！就一定能够胜利”！
    工地上有多少个王丁！当党委又提出一个鼓舞人心的截流新方案，把群众发动起来之后，五十天完成的工作量就相等于过去的一百三十一天。
    刘家峡枢纽工程胜利地闯过了截流大关。驯河的英雄们正乘胜前进的展开了建设刘家峡水利枢纽的主体工程。刘家峡人为胜利截流而欢笑。（附图片）
