    Treat New Forces in Scientific Research with Full Enthusiasm
    Lu Ge
    Since 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line and propelled by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, China's scientific undertaking has clarified its direction of serving socialist construction, strengthened the leadership of the Party, and achieved an unprecedented great leap forward. In 1958 alone, the scientific research projects completed by universities and colleges exceeded ten times that of 1957, far surpassing the total amount from 1949 to 1956. The quality of scientific research has also greatly improved. Many scientific research results have been applied in production, and significant scientific projects are under research, with certain achievements made.
    During the great leap forward in scientific research over the past two years, scientific workers in various universities and colleges and scientific research institutions, whether veteran experts or young teachers and students, have played their respective roles under the leadership of the Party, promoting the advancement of scientific undertakings.
    Following the call for anti-rightism and boosting morale at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, scientific research work is experiencing a new high tide, driven by the continued leap forward in the national economy and the new situation of vigorously promoting technological and cultural revolutions. Fully leveraging the strength of scientific workers from all fields, "setting high aspirations, making firm resolutions, boosting morale, and scaling peaks" has become an extremely important task for the current scientific undertaking.
    Within the ranks of scientific workers, veteran teachers and scientists with specialized expertise are an important force. The majority of them have received profound education during the rectification and anti-rightist struggles, and their thinking has undergone varying degrees of change. They have begun to gradually transform their bourgeois worldview, and are therefore able to contribute their efforts with ease of mind. In the continued leap forward of scientific undertakings in the future, their role will be further enhanced.
    The vibrant younger generation of scientific workers, who are much larger in number than the older scientific workers, are a more promising and vigorous new force. They have broken down superstitions, liberated their thinking, leveraged collective strength, launched mass movements, and achieved a large number of fruitful results in scientific research. This is a significant characteristic of the great leap forward in scientific research over the past year. It is precisely because of their extensive participation in scientific research that the situation of scientific research over the past two years has transformed from a few experts conducting research behind closed doors in a cold and desolate manner, into a vigorous and massive mass movement. In the new upsurge of the great leap forward in scientific undertakings, we must pay more attention to their role.
    The Party has always emphasized the importance of valuing and cultivating new forces on the cultural and educational front. Marxists have always believed that everything is developing, and that new things are always more vibrant and have broader prospects than existing things. Regarding young teachers and students in universities and colleges and young researchers in scientific research institutions, they are generally less deeply influenced by the old society, have fewer burdens, are highly motivated, and full of vitality. As Chairman Mao said to Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union, they "are in a period of prosperity, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning." They are the vital force on the scientific front, and they represent the future of science and technology. In leading scientific undertakings, the Party always pays attention to uniting veteran and experienced scientific workers, while placing greater hope in these new forces, valuing their role, and caring for their growth. Many veteran teachers and scientists also regard them as successors to their careers and provide them with enthusiastic help. The situation of these new forces rapidly growing under the Party's care and cultivation and the help of the older generation of scientific workers is a very favorable factor for achieving greater victories in the continued leap forward of scientific undertakings.
    However, some people do not treat these vigorously growing new forces with full enthusiasm. They disregard the great achievements made by the new forces after participating in scientific research and the new atmosphere that has emerged in the scientific community. They always believe that the young people have a poor scientific foundation, low level, and cannot achieve anything significant. They believe that the result of the mass scientific research by young people over the past two years is "chaotic and all for naught." They also believe that the Party's emphasis on young people encourages their arrogance, and that the Party's support for young people's bold innovation encourages their exaggeration.
    These kinds of arguments are merely a reflection of the hostility of a small number of bourgeois intellectuals towards the new forces in scientific undertakings. They stubbornly stand on the bourgeois position, adhere to the expert line in scientific research, and oppose the Party's mass line. In their view, scientific research is only the business of a few experts, not something that the broad masses of young people can even inquire about, let alone adopt the approach of mass movements. The reason why these people are so hostile to the participation of new forces in scientific research is essentially because after the rectification and anti-rightist struggles, their bourgeois ideology has been discredited in politics and ideology; after the educational revolution, the Party's educational policy has been thoroughly implemented, and they can no longer adhere to their bourgeois path in teaching. What remains is only scientific research, which they feel is still their special skill. They believe that it has a very high threshold, which the masses cannot easily cross, and can still be their free world, allowing them to leisurely enjoy themselves with the remnants of bourgeois ideology. Unexpectedly, this large force of new forces, riding the waves of the great leap forward, has poured into the door of scientific research in large numbers, breaking into their forbidden zone and disrupting their sweet dreams. Therefore, they are hostile out of fear, sparing no effort to distort the facts, nitpick, and search for some individual shortcomings to attack, attempting to strangle these growing new forces and return scientific research work to the situation of being monopolized by a few experts.
    However, the facts have shattered the slander of this small group of people against the new forces. It is precisely because a large number of new forces have invested in scientific research work that the number of completed projects, the scope of research, the close connection with production practice, and the importance to national construction in the past two years are far greater than what could be compared when a few experts monopolized scientific research work in the past. These young scientific workers may have a poorer foundation and lower level, but they can rely on the leadership of the Party and leverage collective strength. Numerous vivid examples prove that they can and have already made many outstanding achievements in scientific research. Over the past two years, under the participation of a large number of young people, the scientific undertaking has truly been vibrant and thriving. As for the young people generating arrogance or exaggeration due to their achievements, this is certainly not good. Arrogance and exaggeration are what we have always opposed. Chairman Mao has repeatedly encouraged young people to "be both brave and modest." Those who are arrogant and exaggerated are only a very small number among the broad masses of young people, and they can correct these shortcomings under the education of the Party. In fact, in the process of collective tackling of key problems, what is generated more is not arrogance, but a spirit of daring to think and daring to do, and moving forward courageously. This spirit is precisely a necessary condition and a favorable factor for climbing the peak of science, and it is even more worthy of our attention and promotion. It is completely inappropriate to adopt an attitude of exclusion towards young people's participation in scientific research on the pretext of their arrogance and exaggeration.
    There are also some people who do not seem to oppose the importance of valuing and cultivating new forces in scientific undertakings. However, they believe that compared with new forces, more emphasis should be placed on the role of veteran teachers and scientists. They place the problem of neglecting new forces on an equal footing with the problem of neglecting veteran teachers and scientists, and believe that since the launch of mass scientific research by young people in 1958, the superstition of bourgeois experts has been broken, and the problem of neglecting new forces has been solved. The current problem is mainly how to prevent neglecting the role of veteran teachers and scientists, and there is no need to emphasize the issue of paying attention to new forces anymore.
    This kind of argument is actually a reflection of a bourgeois scientific line.
    We know that the importance and cultivation of new forces is directly related to the future of science and technology. Without the continuous and large-scale replenishment of new forces, the scientific and technological ranks cannot grow stronger day by day, and the peak of science will be difficult to climb smoothly. In particular, the development of modern science cannot be accomplished without a huge scientific team. If we neglect the cultivation of new forces and rely solely on a few veteran experts, it will be difficult to carry out modern large-scale and complex scientific and technological work. The United States has a relatively large number of scientific personnel, but after the Soviet Union launched artificial satellites and space rockets, the United States realized that the work of cultivating new forces in science and technology was still far behind. If our eyes only see a few professors and experts, and neglect the care and cultivation of new forces, we will never be able to catch up with the world's advanced scientific level in a short period of time.
    Secondly, the problem of neglecting the role of veteran teachers and scientists does not exist in the first place. China's scientific undertaking is flourishing, and as long as there are people with real talent and learning, there are opportunities to play a role. The reason why some veteran teachers and scientists were unable to play a better role in the past was mainly because their own bourgeois worldview hindered their good integration with the cause of socialist construction. The Party's help in transforming their thinking is precisely to enable them to gradually change their worldview and better play a role in socialist construction. In fact, during the great leap forward in scientific research over the past two years, their role has been fully realized. Therefore, if we say that there were some problems in this regard in the past, they were only temporary, and it is not difficult to correct them, and they have been corrected quickly. However, the neglect of new forces is not something that can be solved temporarily, and it must be paid attention to frequently. Because new forces are constantly emerging in the development of science, there is always the problem of new forces. These new forces, unlike veteran teachers and scientists who already have a certain status in society and have been recognized in science and technology, are only beginning to emerge or have not yet emerged, which is easily overlooked. Therefore, caring for and cultivating these new forces, and preventing their premature death, will inevitably become a problem that must be frequently addressed in scientific work.
    How to treat the new forces in scientific research reflects our feelings towards new things in our thinking. Marxists always value the growing new things and treat these new things with full enthusiasm, even if they still have shortcomings and are still very naive. However, people who are dominated by bourgeois ideology always only see the dominant things in front of them, and do not see the new things that are sprouting. They either suppress it or ignore it. This ideological struggle cannot be completely resolved in just one or two rounds, and must be constantly noted in the work.
    The new forces that have emerged in large numbers during the great leap forward in scientific research and are still emerging are the hope of China's scientific undertaking. Their importance and cultivation are related to the future of China's scientific undertaking. To realize the continued great leap forward in the scientific undertaking and strive to catch up with the world's advanced scientific level in the shortest period of time, we must resolutely oppose the bourgeois expert line in scientific research, adhere to the Party's mass line, and treat the new forces in scientific research with full enthusiasm.

    以满腔热情对待科学研究中的新生力量
    鲁歌
    我国的科学事业自从1958年以来，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在工农业生产大跃进的形势推动下，明确了为社会主义建设服务的方针，加强了党的领导，出现了空前大跃进的局面。仅仅高等学校1958年一年完成的科学研究项目，就超过了1957年的十倍，远远超过1949到1956年八年的总和。科学研究的质量也大大提高，许多科学研究的成果都已在生产上运用，不少重要的科学项目，都在进行研究，并且有了一定的成绩。
    在两年来科学研究工作大跃进中，各高等学校和各科学研究机关的科学工作者，不论是年老的专家，或者是青年教师和学生，都在党的领导下，发挥了各自的作用，推动了科学事业的前进。
    在党的八届八中全会提出反右倾、鼓干劲的号召以后，科学研究工作正在国民经济继续跃进和大搞技术革命，文化革命的新形势推动下，出现了新的高潮。充分发挥各方面科学工作者的力量，“立大志、下决心、鼓干劲、登高峰”，成为当前科学事业十分重要的任务。
    在科学工作者队伍中，学有专长的老教师和老科学家是一支重要的力量。他们中的大多数人在整风反右斗争中受到深刻的教育，思想起了不同程度的变化，开始逐步改变自己的资产阶级世界观，因而能够心情舒畅地贡献出自己的力量。在今后科学事业的继续跃进中，他们的作用将得到进一步的发挥。
    科学工作者队伍中生气勃勃的青年一代，比年老的科学工作者数量大得多，他们是更有前途、更有生命力的新生力量。他们破除迷信，解放思想，发挥了集体力量，大搞群众运动，在科学研究工作中结出了大量丰硕的果实，这是一年多来科学研究工作大跃进的一个显著的特色。正是由于他们大量地参加了科学研究工作，才使得科学研究工作两年来由少数专家冷冷清清关门研究的局面，变成轰轰烈烈声势浩大的群众性运动。在科学事业新的跃进高潮中，我们必须更加重视他们的作用。
    党在文化教育战线上一向强调要重视和培养新生力量。马克思主义者从来认为一切事物是发展的，新生事物比起原有事物来总是更有生命力，更有广阔前途的。以高等学校的青年教师、学生和科学研究机关的青年研究人员来说，他们一般受旧社会的影响不深，包袱少，干劲大，朝气蓬勃，精力充沛，正如毛主席对我国留苏学生所说的，他们“正在兴旺时期，好像早晨八、九点钟的太阳”。他们是科学战线上的生力军，他们代表着科学技术的未来。党在领导科学事业中总是在注意团结年老的有经验的科学工作者的同时，把更大的希望寄托在这些新生力量身上，重视他们的作用，关怀他们的成长。不少老教师老科学家也把他们看做是自己事业的继承者而对他们热情帮助。这些新生力量在党的关怀培养和老一辈科学工作者的帮助下迅速成长的形势，是科学事业继续跃进取得更大胜利的十分有利的因素。
    但是，有一些人对待这些蓬勃生长的新生力量却并不是满怀热情的，他们无视于新生力量参加科学研究工作后所取得的巨大成就和科学界所出现的新气象，他们总是认为青年们科学基础差，水平低，搞不出什么名堂来。他们认为两年来青年群众大搞科研的结果是“乱哄哄、一场空”。他们还认为党对青年人的重视助长了青年人的骄气，党支持青年们大胆创造是助长他们的浮夸。
    这种种论调，只不过是一小部分资产阶级知识分子对科学事业中新生力量敌视的反映。他们顽强地站在资产阶级的立场，坚持科学研究工作中的专家路线，反对党的群众路线，在他们看来，科学研究工作只是少数专家的事，根本就不是广大青年群众所能问津，当然更不能采取群众运动的做法。这些人所以这样敌视新生力量参加科学研究工作，实质上是因为经过了整风反右，他们在政治思想上，资产阶级的一套已经搞臭了；经过了教育大革命，深入贯彻党的教育方针，在教学上也不能再坚持他们的资产阶级道路了；剩下来的只有科学研究，觉得还是自己的看家本领，他们认为它有很高的门槛，群众一时跨不进来，还可以是他们的自由天地，任他们带着资产阶级的残渣剩汁在其中悠游自得。想不到这一大股新生力量乘着大跃进的浪涛大量地涌进了科学研究之门，冲入了他们的禁地，扰乱了他们的清梦，于是他们由害怕而敌视，不惜歪曲事实，挑毛拣刺，搜寻一些个别的缺点，加以攻击，企图扼杀这些正在成长中的新生力量，使科学研究工作仍旧回到他们少数专家垄断的局面。
    但是，事实粉碎了这一小部分人对于新生力量的诽谤。正是由于大量新生力量投入科学研究工作，才使两年来的研究完成项目之多，范围之广，与生产实际联系的密切，对国家建设关系的重要，都远非过去少数专家垄断科学研究工作时所可比拟。这些青年科学工作者也许基础较差，水平较低，但是他们能依靠党的领导，能发挥集体力量，无数生动的事例证明，他们在科学研究上是可以做出而且已经做出了许多出色的成绩的。两年来，科学事业在大量青年群众参加下，真是万紫千红，枝荣叶茂。至于青年们由于做出了成绩，而产生了骄气或者浮夸，这当然是不好的。骄傲浮夸是我们始终反对的，毛主席就一再勉励青年人“既要勇敢，又要谦虚”。骄傲浮夸的人，只是广大青年群众中的极少数，他们在党的教育下是可以改正这些缺点的。事实上，青年们在集体攻坚的过程中，更多产生的并不是骄气，而是一种敢想敢做、勇往直前的豪气。这种豪气，正是攀登科学高峰所必须具备的条件和有利因素，更值得我们重视和发扬。借口青年人骄傲和浮夸而对他们参加科学研究工作采取排斥的态度是完全不应该的。
    也有一些人，他们似乎也不反对在科学事业中重视和培养新生力量，但是，他们认为，和新生力量比起来，更应该重视和发挥老教师老科学家的作用。他们把忽视新生力量的问题和忽视老教师老科学家的问题放在同等地位，并且认为自从1958年发动青年群众大搞科学研究以后，人们对资产阶级专家的迷信已经破除，忽视新生力量的问题已经解决，现在的问题主要是如何防止忽视老教师老科学家的作用，而不必再强调注意新生力量的问题了。
    这种论调，其实也是一种资产阶级科学路线的反映。
    我们知道，对新生力量的重视和培养，直接关系着科学技术的未来。没有新生力量不断地大量地补充，科学技术队伍就不能日益壮大，科学高峰就难于顺利攀登。特别是现代科学的发展，非有一支庞大的科学队伍就不能攻坚，如果忽视新生力量的培养，仅仅依靠少数老专家就很难进行现代规模巨大关系复杂的科学技术工作。美国的科学人员是比较多的，但在苏联发射人造卫星和宇宙火箭以后，美国觉察到科学技术上培养新生力量的工作仍然大为落后。如果我们眼睛只看到少数几个教授专家，而忽视对新生力量的关怀和培养，我们就决不可能在短期内赶上世界先进科学水平。
    其次忽视老教师老科学家的作用问题是本来不存在的。我国的科学事业正在蓬勃开展，只要有真才实学的人，都有发挥作用的机会。有一些老教师老科学家过去之所以不能更好地发挥作用，主要是他们自己的资产阶级世界观阻碍着他们与社会主义建设事业很好地结合。党所以帮助他们改造思想，正是为了让他们能够逐步改变自己的世界观，更好地在社会主义建设中发挥作用。事实上，在这两年来科学研究大跃进中，他们的作用已经得到充分发挥了。因此，如果说我们过去在这方面还存在一些问题的话，也只是暂时的，不难纠正而且已经很快得到了纠正，但是，对新生力量的忽视，则不是一时可以解决的，必须经常予以注意。因为科学的发展时时有新生力量出现，就时时有新生力量的问题。这些新生力量不像老教师老科学家在社会上已经有了一定的地位，在科学技术上已经被人们承认，他们只是初露头角，或者还未露头角，这是容易被人们忽视的。因此，关怀、培养这些新生力量，防止他们的夭折，就必然要成为科学工作中经常注意的问题。
    如何对待科学研究工作中的新生力量，反映着我们在思想上对待新生事物的感情，马克思主义者总是重视正在成长中的新生事物，以满腔热情对待这些新生事物，那怕它们目前还有缺点，还很幼稚。而受资产阶级思想支配的人们却总是只看见眼前占优势的事物，而看不见正在萌芽中的新生事物，对它不是压制，便是漠然置之。这种思想上的斗争，决不是一两个回合便可以彻底解决，必须在工作中经常注意。
    在科学研究大跃进中大量涌现出来并且还在不断涌现的新生力量，是我国科学事业的希望所在。对他们的重视和培养，关系着我国科学事业的前途。要实现科学事业继续大跃进，争取在最短期间赶上世界先进科学水平，我们必须坚决反对科学研究工作中的资产阶级专家路线，坚持党的群众路线，以满腔热情对待科学研究工作中的新生力量。
