    Song of the Coal Shoveler
    For years, shoveling with a big shovel,
    Sweat soaked through my trousers;
    Now, with a 'little iron ox' in hand,
    Working feels light and breezy;
    All thanks to the good leadership of the Party,
    Coal miners straighten their backs as they shovel!

    攉煤工之歌
    多少年来攉大锹，
    汗水流了一裤腰；
    如今手把‘小铁牛’，
    干起活来轻飘飘；
    都是党的领导好，
    矿工攉煤直起腰！
