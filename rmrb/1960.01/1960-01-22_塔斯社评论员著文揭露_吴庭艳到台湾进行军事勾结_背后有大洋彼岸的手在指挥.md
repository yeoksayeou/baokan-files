Xinhua News Agency, January 19th. TASS Moscow, January 18th: TASS commentator Kharikov exposed the collusion between South Vietnam's Ngô Đình Diệm and Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan in a commentary.

The commentator wrote that a gentleman, grandly called the President of South Vietnam, graced Taiwan—Chiang Kai-shek's bandit den. Chiang Kai-shek's elements embraced the South Vietnamese dictator with unusual warmth: after all, if one doesn't count the US Army and Navy generals, foreign guests are not a common sight in Taiwan. Few people are willing to smell the odor of Chiang Kai-shek's decaying corpse.

The Kuomintang newspapers wrote that the secret talks between Ngô Đình Diệm and Chiang Kai-shek discussed "a wide range of issues related to the alignment of actions between the two sides."

The commentator pointed out that the deeds of the Chiang Kai-shek and Ngô Đình Diệm elements are known to the world. Their political fates are similar to each other. Both groups rely on the "Cold War" policy to absorb nourishment and exist.

Currently, when warm winds are blowing in the world, the puppets are in fear and unease. They are worried that the further relaxation of international tensions will cause them to lose everything they depend on. Those who bet on these inferior horses, those who want to use them as pawns of the "Cold War" in the future, are also uneasy. Precisely because of this, in the nests of the Chiang Kai-shek and Ngô Đình Diệm elements, and among the American "lobby" speaking for the Chiang Kai-shek and Ngô Đình Diệm elements, there are sad cries about the need to "establish a common force." At the same time, the Kuomintang's "United Daily News" bluntly stated that this "common force" should obstruct the development of the international situation.

The commentator further pointed out that there is another reason why it is worthwhile to mention this despicable event: behind the sabotage activities of Chiang Kai-shek and Ngô Đình Diệm, there is someone else's hand directing them. For example, just before this "visit" of Ngô Đình Diệm to Taiwan, the US Secretary of the Army, Brucker, made belligerent remarks in Saigon and Taipei.

The connections between the Chiang Kai-shek, Ngô Đình Diệm, and Syngman Rhee elements are becoming increasingly diverse. The exchanges of military delegations have become more and more frequent recently. This proves that the military relations between these three corpses are becoming closer.

The commentator said that it can be seen that this connection is beneficial to the group across the ocean. Chiang Kai-shek's "Prime Minister" Chen Cheng had long bluntly stated that relying on Chiang Kai-shek's elements to "defend" Taiwan is much cheaper than the United States occupying Taiwan. Chen Cheng said, "It is more expensive to support an American soldier than to support fifteen Taiwanese soldiers." The Syngman Rhee and Ngô Đình Diệm elements are also the same cheap "cannon fodder" for the American generals. Is this Taipei drama related to this?

### 塔斯社评论员著文揭露  吴庭艳到台湾进行军事勾结  背后有大洋彼岸的手在指挥

    塔斯社评论员著文揭露
    吴庭艳到台湾进行军事勾结  背后有大洋彼岸的手在指挥
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：塔斯社评论员哈里科夫在评论中揭露了南越吴庭艳到台湾同蒋介石勾结的勾当。
    评论员写道，一位美其名曰南越总统的先生光临台湾——蒋介石的匪巢。蒋介石分子异常亲热地拥抱了南越独裁者：要知道，如果不算美国陆海军将军们，外国客人到台湾是不常见的现象。很少有人愿意去闻一闻正在腐烂中的蒋介石僵尸的气味。
    国民党的报纸写道，吴庭艳和蒋介石的秘密谈判讨论了“有关双方行动一致的范围很广泛的问题”。
    评论员指出，蒋介石分子和吴庭艳分子的所作所为是举世尽知的。他们的政治命运是彼此相像的。这两个集团都是依赖“冷战”政策来吸收营养和存在的。
    目前，当世界上吹起暖风的时候，傀儡们处于恐惧不安之中。他们担心，国际紧张局势的进一步缓和将使他们失去一切凭借。那些把赌注押在这些劣马身上的人们，那些今后想利用他们作为“冷战”走卒的人们也惶惶不安。正因为如此，在蒋介石分子和吴庭艳分子的巢穴中以及在为蒋介石分子、吴庭艳分子讲话的美国“院外集团”中才伤心地叫嚷什么必须“建立共同的力量”。同时，国民党的“联合报”直截了当地说，这种“共同力量”应该阻挠国际局势的发展。
    评论员又指出，值得提起这种卑鄙的事件还有一个原因，在蒋介石和吴庭艳的破坏活动的背后，有一只别人的手在那里指挥。譬如，就在这次吴庭艳“访问”台湾之前，美国的陆军部长布鲁克，就曾经在西贡和台北大发好战言论。
    蒋介石分子、吴庭艳分子和李承晚分子之间的联系花样越来越多。最近军事代表团的往来越来越频繁。这证明这三个僵尸在军事方面的关系越来越紧密了。
    评论员说，可以看出，这种联系对大洋彼岸的集团是有利的。蒋介石的行政院长陈诚将军早就赤裸裸地说，依靠蒋介石分子“保卫”台湾要比美国占领台湾便宜得多，陈诚说，“养一个美国士兵比养十五个台湾士兵还要贵。”李承晚分子和吴庭艳分子也是美国将军们的同样廉价的“炮灰”。台北这场戏是否与此有关呢？
