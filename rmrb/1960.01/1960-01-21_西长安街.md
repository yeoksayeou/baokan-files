    West Chang'an Avenue
    Painting by Zheng Shuang, Poem by Li Cun
    The street trees are still,
    The snow has just cleared,
    Thousands of cars drive side by side,
    Tens of thousands of people walk the same road.
    Under the pines in front of the Great Hall,
    We meet in victory in Beijing.
    So many outstanding figures,
    United in heart for socialism.
    The whole day is filled with joy in the twilight,
    Endless feelings before Tiananmen Square.
    The moon is pale in the sky,
    The night breeze is light,
    The People's Square preserves a historical poem,
    A red star is raised on the Monument to the Heroes.
    People are not asleep by Zhongnanhai,
    Planning all night until dawn.
    In the shadow of the red walls,
    Deep in the night, all is quiet.
    Only the magnolia flowers are seen under the lights,
    Chang'an Avenue is brightly lit at night. (With picture)

    西长安街
    郑爽画  李村诗
    街树静，
    雪刚晴，
    千车并排走，
    万人同路行。
    大会堂前松林下，
    胜利相逢在北京。
    多少风流人物，
    社会主义结同心。
    整日欢腾暮色里，
    天安门前情无尽。
    天上月淡，
    夜来风轻，
    人民广场留史诗，
    英雄碑上举红星。
    中南海边人未睡，
    整夜筹谋到天明。
    红墙影里，
    夜深人静。
    只见玉兰花灯下，
    长安街上夜通明。（附图片）
