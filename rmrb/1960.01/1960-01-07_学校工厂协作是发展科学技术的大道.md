    School-Factory Collaboration is the Broad Road to Developing Science and Technology
    The Chinese Communist Party Committee of Harbin Institute of Technology

    Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, Harbin Institute of Technology has mobilized its teachers and students to collaborate with factories and enterprises in carrying out scientific research work, achieving great results.

    In the past few years, in the process of combining teaching with scientific research, our school has collaborated with 547 factories, mines, and enterprises in more than 100 cities and counties in 15 provinces, directly solving major technical problems in production and promoting production; at the same time, it has also improved teaching quality and promoted scientific research work. Through school-factory collaboration, we have found scientific research topics that urgently need to be solved in production, and have implemented the policy of "starting from the overall task of socialist construction and serving economic construction and national defense construction" for scientific research. In this way, the positive factors of all parties have been mobilized, and difficulties such as lack of equipment, materials, and processing power have been overcome relatively smoothly. Now it seems that school-factory collaboration is a broad road to develop science and technology in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    (I) The Great Education Revolution Promoted the Great School-Factory Collaboration

    Our school's vigorous collaboration with factories and enterprises to carry out scientific research work is a new development of the long-term close contact with factories. As early as the early stage of the school's expansion in 1953, Soviet experts, graduate students, and senior students often solved some technical problems for factories during their internships. Starting in 1956, our school decided to combine with production needs, select graduation design topics, and carry out graduation design in conjunction with the technical transformation of factories, with teachers and engineers jointly guiding, in order to solve the difficulties of young teachers lacking production experience in guiding graduation design. At that time, more than 70 teachers and students participated in the technical transformation work of 11 factories, including Jinan Second Machine Tool Factory and Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, in combination with graduation design and advanced studies. This was not only a great technical support for the factories, but also brought about a new situation in our school's graduation design, in which technical problems in production were directly solved and the quality was significantly improved. However, at that time, this kind of collaboration was only partial and temporary, limited to a few majors in terms of scope, and limited to a few months of graduation design in terms of time.

    In 1958, school-factory collaboration underwent a fundamental change. At this time, the school implemented the Great Education Revolution, and the idea of "combining education with productive labor" has become the direction of teachers and students. Teachers and students want to find scientific research topics from production and solve the material conditions problems such as materials, funds, and processing required for scientific research work. Factories also have an urgent need to further cooperate with schools. In addition, since the implementation of work-study programs, the design and research capabilities of teachers and senior students have gradually been recognized by everyone, and the "Communist style" proposed by the Party has given us a strong appeal. Thus, in the past two years, there has been a great collaboration between our school and many factories. The cold and deserted academy-style life, divorced from production and divorced from society, has come to an end.

    (II) Several Practices of School-Factory Collaboration

    School-factory collaboration should adopt different practices under different specific circumstances. Based on our school's experience in school-factory collaboration, we believe that the following practices are effective.

    Combining going down to factories to work and solving technical problems. This practice was created by our school students in the work-study movement in the spring of 1958. Third and fourth-year students, as cultural technical workers, participate in the production labor of off-campus factories. On the one hand, they can directly learn from the working class, and on the other hand, they can also solve some technical problems in production. For example, in the spring of 1958, the fourth-year students of the metallography major signed contracts with 14 factories including Harbin No. 1 Auto Parts Factory, and solved 47 technical problems for the factories, such as changing the toxic cyanidation in the heat treatment parts process to non-toxic liquid carburization. This is the beginning of our school's great collaboration with factories in the past two years. The practice in the past two years shows that this practice has enabled senior students to be trained and to exert their potential, and the effect is good.

    Summarizing the inventions and creations of the working masses and processing and improving them. During the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of workers had many inventions and creations, which urgently needed to be summarized, improved, and promoted. This is also a good opportunity for school teachers and students to learn from workers and play a role. Under the leadership of the provincial and municipal party committees, our school's mechanical manufacturing technology major collaborated with Harbin Machine United Machinery Factory in 1958 to summarize the experience of modular machine tools created by workers. This major also collaborated with the Machine Tool Research Institute and relevant machine tool factories to analyze and summarize the characteristics of more than 800 indigenous machine tools created by workers and peasants across the country during the Great Leap Forward, absorb the essence of them, and design a complete set of simple machine tools for the development of rural machinery industry. Through this summary, the workers' creations can be improved and promoted in a wider range; teachers and students can also learn vivid knowledge that cannot be learned from books, enrich the teaching content, and find important clues for determining the direction of scientific research. This is an effective way of school-factory collaboration.

    Learning from each other's strengths and improving each other. This is another successful way of collaboration between our school and factories. For example, in 1958, our school's industrial enterprise electrification major cooperated with Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Factory to successfully develop a large-scale advanced product—electron tube copying vertical lathe. Previously, the factory lacked the technical force of power transmission, and the school lacked the mechanical processing power to manufacture large-scale precision lathes. Neither party could do it alone. After school-factory collaboration, each party gave full play to its strengths and complemented each other. As a result, it was successfully developed in less than three months. This method of collaboration is most easily accepted by both schools and factories.

    Counterpart collaboration. This is a further development of school-factory collaboration since 1959. Our school's steam turbine and boiler majors have signed systematic, comprehensive, and long-term cooperation contracts with Harbin Steam Turbine Factory and Harbin Boiler Factory. Both parties send personnel to give lectures, give and exchange materials with each other, help each other establish laboratories, jointly conduct scientific research, and provide schools and teachers and students with convenient conditions for participating in factory production labor and conducting graduation design, so that the relationship between the school and the factory is becoming increasingly close, and the aspects of collaboration are becoming increasingly extensive. Developing this kind of counterpart collaboration is the direction of our school's majors.

    "Large-area" collaboration. That is, the school implements comprehensive collaboration with various factories under the relevant ministries and bureaus of the state. This is a new attempt by our school to carry out school-factory collaboration in 1959. At the beginning of 1959, our school and the relevant bureaus of the First Ministry of Machine Building convened a meeting of responsible cadres from ten factories and schools under the bureau, and each major and factory selected and are completing more than 30 collaborative projects. The advantage of this method of collaboration is that the main topics in a production system can be comprehensively concentrated, and the strong support of the ministry and bureau can be obtained in the conduct of research work and the promotion of research results.

    (III) Several Experiences in School-Factory Collaboration

    In carrying out scientific research work in school-factory collaboration, we have the following four experiences.

    To do a good job in school-factory collaboration, we must first solve the political orientation of scientific research. That is to implement the proletariat's policy of "scientific research serving socialist construction," and oppose and liquidate the bourgeoisie's policy of seeking personal fame and gain or "science for science," which is to put politics in command of scientific research and school-factory collaboration.

    In the past few years, especially since the Great Education Revolution, the process of our school's collaboration with factories has essentially been the process of taking the socialist road or the capitalist road in scientific research. We first liquidated the bourgeois idea that collaboration with factories was only for the purpose of obtaining data and writing papers to become famous in one fell swoop, and cleared the way for school-factory collaboration. In the past, some people believed that "factories solve today's specific production problems, and schools solve tomorrow's profound theoretical problems." In the spring of 1959, this erroneous idea of "science for science" was thoroughly criticized, so that we could establish a comprehensive cooperative relationship with counterpart factories that had not been done well for several years. Recently, we also criticized a disguised idea of "science for science." Some teaching and research sections also cooperate with many factories on the surface, but in essence, they still focus on theoretical research divorced from reality. Today, they cooperate with this factory to tackle this type of problem, and tomorrow they cooperate with that factory to tackle another type of problem. They think they are far-sighted and deeply successful, but in fact, this kind of "touch-and-go" scientific research, because it is not for the sake of socialist construction, cannot grasp the trend of technological development, often cannot grasp the key, and achieves half the result with twice the effort. Once this idea is liquidated, the school-factory collaboration of these majors will take a big step forward.

    Secondly, we must grasp the key problems in production. Because key problems are the most urgent need to be solved for the development of production, and they themselves have the conditions for solving the problems that are maturing. Grasping this kind of key problem can mobilize the positive factors of all parties, can obtain results and open up the situation relatively quickly, and may form the scientific research direction of this major in the process of solving major key problems. This changes the situation of some teaching and research sections that first make abstract scientific research plans in scientific research and circle around in determining the direction of scientific research for a long time. For example, in the case of insufficient large-scale casting equipment in our country, the turbine ring is one of the key problems in the production of power generation equipment. The research on the new forging process of guard rings conducted by the pressure processing major has been enthusiastically supported by relevant factories. It quickly used a 400 kg steam hammer to replace a large hydraulic press to successfully forge a 500 kW steam turbine generator guard ring. Further research on the new forging process of larger guard rings has become the research direction of this major. The Motor Teaching and Research Section has formed its own scientific research direction in the process of collaborating with Harbin Electric Machinery Factory to solve a series of technical problems in designing large motors. School-factory collaboration to solve key problems in production must make the technical solutions start from reality and improve as much as possible, otherwise the solutions cannot be realized.

    Thirdly, another important issue in doing a good job in school-factory collaboration is to have a communist style. That is to use a revolutionary spirit to carry out comrade-style cooperation, jointly develop cutting-edge technology, and climb the peaks of science. In collaboration, we should work hard and not care about partial and personal gains and losses. At the same time, we should welcome more people to participate in order to continuously expand the technical revolution team. In collaboration, we should pay attention to respecting the labor of others, and the estimate of the role played by our own unit should not be taken to heart. In dealing with the issue of confidentiality, we must also pay attention to being conducive to the development of collaboration. Anything that is indeed a state secret must be resolutely handled in accordance with the confidentiality regulations, but we must never refuse comrades to jointly participate in the technological revolution due to the confidentiality issue, which will affect the development of the country's scientific cause.

    Fourthly, the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in school-factory collaboration is to rely on the leadership of the Party. Since the Great Leap Forward, school-factory collaboration has been personally led by the heads of the Party organizations of both parties, and jointly deployed, reversing the past situation in which only teachers and technicians contacted each other, which was often not easy to solve the problem. When teachers and students go down to the factory, they work under the leadership of the factory Party committee; when factory technicians and workers come to the school, they are also under the unified leadership of the school Party committee. At the same time, the school must also promptly ask the local Party committee for instructions and report, and consciously accept the leadership. This has a decisive effect on implementing the Party's scientific research policy, determining the research direction, grasping key topics, promoting the communist style, and consolidating and developing school-factory collaboration.

    (IV) Several Issues in Further Developing School-Factory Collaboration

    Under the current situation of the continued leap forward in industry and agriculture, according to the spirit of "hard work, practical work, and skillful work," the Party and the government have further strengthened the leadership of scientific research work, and have planned and organized the collaboration of schools, factories, and scientific research institutions. In this way, the topics of school-factory collaboration often become tasks assigned by the Party and the government, so that the collaboration develops further, the scope becomes more stereotyped, and the time becomes longer. Under this circumstance, we believe that it is not only necessary to do a good job in linking up between schools and factories, but more importantly, to actively and proactively report to the central Party and government leading organs in a timely manner, and develop the collaboration between schools and factories through the leadership, so that the research topics can have a greater impact on socialist construction.

    In this way, the problem of insufficient research strength of teachers and students and the establishment of the school's scientific research establishment also arises. We believe that in the process of completing increasingly large tasks for the country, relying on the support of the Party and government leading organs, we can gradually cultivate and strengthen the school's full-time scientific research team. At the same time, we must also solve the problems of processing and trial production that cannot be completely solved by factories due to heavy production tasks in school-factory collaboration. Therefore, the school should have its own processing and trial production factory or workshop.

    It must also be noted that in the process of school-factory collaboration, we must not only learn to use theory to solve practical problems, but also constantly accumulate data from solving practical problems and improve it to a theoretical summary; we must not only solve technical problems, but also write papers. We should gradually climb the peaks of world science with the victory of the socialist construction cause of the motherland.

    Finally, it should also be pointed out that school-factory collaboration will not be smooth sailing, and the struggle between the two classes and the two roads in the transition period will inevitably be reflected in this issue. Therefore, we recently proposed to "win both red and expert" in school-factory collaboration. That is to say, we must not only strive for the victory of scientific research, but also put politics in command, the Party committee leads, and achieve the victory of establishing and developing communist cooperative relations. This is to prepare for the great future in the current specific work, so that all roads lead to communism.

    学校工厂协作是发展科学技术的大道
    中国共产党哈尔滨工业大学委员会
    在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，哈尔滨工业大学发动师生，和工厂企业协作，开展科学研究工作，取得了很大成绩。
    几年来，在结合教学开展科学研究工作过程中，我校先后与十五个省、百多个市、县的五百四十七个厂矿、企业进行协作，一方面直接解决生产中的重大技术问题，促进了生产；同时也提高了教学质量，推动了科学研究工作。通过校厂协作，我们找到了生产中迫切需要解决的科学研究课题，贯彻执行了科学研究“从社会主义建设总任务出发，为经济建设与国防建设服务”的方针。这样，就调动了各方面的积极因素，并比较顺利地克服了设备、材料和加工力量缺乏等困难。现在看来，校厂协作是一条多快好省地发展科学技术的康庄大道。
    （一）教育大革命促进了校厂大协作
    我校和工厂企业大力协作开展科学研究工作，是长期和工厂密切联系的一个新的发展。远在1953年学校扩建初期，苏联专家、研究生和高年级学生在实习中就常为工厂解决一些技术问题。从1956年开始，我校决定结合生产需要，选择毕业设计题目，结合工厂的技术改造进行毕业设计，由教师和工程师共同指导，以解决缺乏生产经验的年青教师在指导毕业设计中的困难问题。当时有七十余名师生结合毕业设计和进修工作，参加了济南第二机床厂、哈尔滨量具刃具厂等十一个工厂的技术改造工作。这不仅对工厂是很大技术支援，同时在我校毕业设计上也出现了直接解决生产中技术问题，质量显著提高的新局面。但当时这种协作只是局部的、暂时的，范围上只限于少数专业，时间也只限于毕业设计的几个月。
    1958年，校厂协作起了一个根本性的变化。这时，学校实行了教育大革命，“教育与生产劳动相结合”的思想已成为师生的方向，师生要寻找来自生产的科学研究课题，解决科学研究工作所需的材料、经费、加工等物质条件问题。工厂也有与学校进一步合作的迫切要求。加上实行勤工俭学以来，教师和高年级的学生的设计和研究能力已逐步取得了大家的公认，党所提出的“共产主义风格”又给了我们强有力的感召，于是两年来就出现了我校与许多工厂之间的大协作。冷冷清清的脱离生产、脱离社会的学院式生活从此宣告结束。
    （二）校厂协作的几种作法
    学校与工厂协作，应在不同的具体情况下采用不同的作法。根据我校在厂校大协作中的经验，我们认为以下几种作法是行之有效的。
    结合下厂劳动，解决技术问题。这种作法是我校学生在1958年春的勤工俭学运动中创造的。三、四年级学生作为有文化的技术工人，参加校外工厂的生产劳动，一方面可直接向工人阶级学习，另一方面也可以解决生产中的某些技术问题。如1958年春当时金相专业四年级的同学们，就与哈尔滨第一汽车零件厂等十四个工厂签订了合同，并为工厂解决了将热处理零件过程中有毒氰化改为无毒液体渗炭等四十七项技术问题。这是近两年来我校与工厂大协作的开端，两年来的实践说明，这种作法使高年级同学受到了锻炼，发挥了潜力，效果是良好的。
    总结工人群众发明创造，加工提高。在大跃进中，广大工人群众有许许多多的发明创造，迫切需要总结提高和推广应用，这也是学校师生向工人学习和发挥作用的好机会。我校机械制造工艺专业在省市委领导下1958年就与哈尔滨机联机械厂协作，总结了工人所创造的积木式机床的经验；这个专业还与机床研究所及有关机床厂协作，分析总结了全国工农群众在大跃进中所创造的八百多台土机床的特点，吸取其中精华，设计出了一整套发展农村机械工业用的简式机床。通过这种总结，使工人的创造能得到提高并在更大范围内推广应用；师生也学到了书本上学不到的活知识，丰富了教学内容，找到了确定科学研究方向的重要线索。这是校厂协作的一个有效的方式。
    取长补短，互相提高。这是我校和工厂协作的又一种成功的方式。如1958年我校工业企业电气化专业与齐齐哈尔第一机床厂合作，研究试制成功大型尖端产品——电子管仿型立式车床，而原先工厂因为缺少电力传动的技术力量，学校则缺少制造大型精密车床的机械加工力量，双方都无法单独进行。校厂协作后，各抒己长，相辅相成，结果不到三个月就试制成功了。这种协作方式是最容易为校厂双方所接受的。
    对口协作。这是1959年来校厂协作的进一步发展。我校汽轮机、锅炉专业与哈尔滨汽轮机厂和哈尔滨锅炉厂订立了系统、全面、长期合作合同，双方互派人员讲学，互相赠送、交换资料，互相帮助建立试验室，共同进行科学研究，以及给予学校师生参加工厂生产劳动、进行毕业设计的便利条件等，使学校与工厂的关系越来越密切，协作的方面越来越广泛。发展这种对口协作是我校各专业前进的方向。
    “大面积”协作。就是学校与国家有关部、局所属各厂实行全面协作，这是我校1959年开展校厂协作的一个新的尝试。1959年年初，我校与第一机械工业部有关局召集了局属的十个工厂和学校负责干部会议，各专业与工厂选定并正完成三十余项协作项目。这种协作方式的好处在于可以把一个生产系统中主要课题全面地集中起来，在研究工作的进行和研究成果的推广中都能得到部、局的强有力的支持。
    （三）校厂协作中的几点体会
    在校厂协作开展科学研究工作中，我们有以下四点体会。
    搞好校厂协作，首先要解决科学研究的政治方向问题。这就是要贯彻执行无产阶级的“科学研究为社会主义建设服务”的方针，而反对和清算资产阶级的为个人名利或“为科学而科学”的方针，这也就是政治挂科学研究之帅，挂校厂协作之帅。
    几年来，特别是教育大革命以来，我校与工厂协作发展的过程，实质上就是科学研究中走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的过程。我们首先清算了与工厂协作只是为了搞数据、写论文，一举成名的资产阶级思想，为校厂协作扫清了道路。过去，有些人认为“工厂解决今天的具体生产问题，学校要解决明天的高深理论问题”。1959年春，彻底批判了这种“为科学而科学”的错误思想，这样才和对口工厂建立起了几年来一直没有搞好的全面协作关系。最近我们还批判了一种变相的“为科学而科学”的思想。有的教研室表面上也与许多工厂协作，但实质上仍以脱离实际的理论研究为中心，今天抓这类问题与这个工厂协作，明天又抓另一类问题与那个工厂协作。他们自以为高瞻远瞩，深为得计，其实这种“蜻蜓点水”式的科学研究，由于不是为社会主义建设而研究，并不能掌握技术发展的趋向，常常抓不住关键，事倍功半。这种思想一被清算，这些专业的校厂协作就前进了一大步。
    其次，必须抓住生产中的关键问题。因为关键问题是发展生产最迫切需要解决的，它本身也就具有正在成熟着的解决问题的条件。抓住这种关键问题，能调动各方面的积极因素，能较快地获得成果和打开局面，并可能在解决重大关键问题的过程中，形成本专业的科学研究方向，这就改变了有些教研室在科学研究中先做出抽象的科学研究规划，长期在定科学研究方向上打圈子的情况。如在我国大型铸造设备不足的情况下，汽轮机护环是发电设备生产中的关键问题之一。压力加工专业所进行的护环锻造新工艺的研究，就得到了有关工厂的热情支持，很快就用四百公斤的汽锤代替了大型水压机锻造成功了五百瓩汽轮发电机护环，进一步研究更大护环的锻造新工艺就成了这个专业的研究方向。电机教研室在与哈尔滨电机厂协作解决设计大型电机一系列技术问题的过程中，形成了自己的科学研究方向。校厂协作解决生产中的关键问题，还要使技术方案从实际出发，并尽可能提高，否则方案就不能实现。
    第三，搞好校厂协作的另一个重要问题是要有共产主义风格。就是要以革命的精神，进行同志式的合作，共同发展尖端技术，攀登科学高峰。在协作中应艰苦奋斗，不计较局部和个人得失，同时，要欢迎更多人参加，以不断扩大技术革命队伍。在协作中要注意尊重别人的劳动，至于对本单位所起的作用的估计是不应介意的。对待保密问题，也要注意有利于发展协作。凡是确属国家机密的，一定要坚决按照保密条例处理，但绝不能因保密问题而拒绝同志共同参加技术革命，影响国家科学事业的发展。
    第四，搞好校厂协作的根本保证，是依靠党的领导。大跃进以来，校厂协作由双方党组织负责人亲自挂帅，共同部署，一反过去仅仅由教师和技术人员来回联系，往往不易解决问题的局面。师生下厂，就在工厂党委领导下进行工作；工厂技术人员、工人到校，也受学校党委的统一领导。同时，学校还要及时向地方党委请示报告，自觉地接受领导。这对贯彻执行党的科学研究方针，确定研究方向，抓住关键课题，发扬共产主义风格和巩固及发展校厂协作，都有决定性的作用。
    （四）进一步发展校厂协作中的几个问题
    在当前工农业继续跃进的形势下，根据“苦干、实干加巧干”的精神，党和政府更加强了对科学研究工作的领导，并有计划有组织地安排了学校、工厂和科学研究机关的协作。这样，校厂协作的课题，往往就变成了党和政府下达的任务，从而使协作更加向前发展，范围更加定型，时间更加延长。在这种情况下，我们认为不仅要搞好校厂之间的挂钩问题，更重要的是积极主动地向中央党政领导机关及时汇报，通过领导发展校厂之间的协作，使研究的课题对社会主义建设发生更大作用。
    这样，也就发生了师生研究力量不足和建立学校的科学研究编制的问题。我们相信，在为国家完成越来越大的任务中，依靠党和政府领导机关的扶持，还是能够逐步培养与壮大学校的专职科学研究队伍的。同时，还必须解决校厂协作中工厂因生产任务繁重不能完全解决的加工、试制问题。因此，学校应该有自己的加工试制工厂或车间。
    还必须注意，在校厂协作过程中，既要学会运用理论解决实际问题，又要从解决实际问题中，不断积累资料，并提高到理论上加以总结；既要解决技术问题，又要写出论文。我们应当随着祖国社会主义建设事业的从胜利走向胜利，而逐步攀登世界科学的高峰。
    最后还应当指出，校厂协作不会是一帆风顺的，过渡时期两个阶级和两条道路的斗争必然会在这个问题上有所反映。因此，我们最近提出，要在校厂协作中“红专两胜”。这就是说，不仅要争取科学研究的胜利，而且要政治挂帅，党委领导，取得建立和发展共产主义协作关系的胜利。这也就是在当前的具体工作中准备伟大的将来，使条条道路都通向共产主义。
