　　Cars speed along the highway. The energy from its engine is transmitted to the axles, and the axles apply force to the road surface through the tires. The road surface, in turn, pushes the car forward with a reaction force... This is the scenario of an ordinary wheeled car in motion. Wheels play a significant role in this. However, the contact between the wheels and the ground also creates several drawbacks for cars. Firstly, it encounters substantial resistance from the ground as it moves forward, especially when the road is uneven, making the ride bumpy and consuming energy unnecessarily. Secondly, it becomes practically impossible to navigate when encountering swamps, marshes, or other difficult terrains. Consequently, people have developed many good roads on Earth for wheeled cars to travel on.

　　Is it possible to overcome the shortcomings of existing cars by designing a wheelless car? This idea was proposed long ago by a scientist. This scientist was the famous Soviet scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a pioneer of astronautics. In a book he wrote in his later years, he put forward the idea of a "wheelless transporter." He suggested that if an air compressor is used to continuously pump air under the car body, relying on air pressure to lift the body, and then using the air compressor to spray air backward, the car could fly on the ground without wheels by riding on the air. He theoretically explained that the air pressure needed to lift the car body does not need to be very high; a residual pressure of just one-tenth of an atmosphere of high-pressure air can provide one ton of lift per square meter of the car body.

　　Based on this idea, Soviet engineer Turkin designed a wheelless car in 1953. His designed wheelless car could suspend hundreds of kilograms of weight in the air and fly.

　　In recent years, wheelless cars have attracted attention and research in many countries. Although the types of wheelless cars being researched and manufactured vary, most use air compressors to expel pressurized air, creating an air cushion of 10 to 30 centimeters between the car body and the ground, allowing the car body to travel on the air cushion.

　　As for the power to propel the car forward, there are currently two types. One uses the reaction thrust generated by the air compressor spraying pressurized air backward to propel the car forward, which is similar to the principle of a jet plane. The other is to install a propeller on the car, using the reaction force of the surrounding air on the propeller as it rotates to propel the car forward, which is similar to the principle of an ordinary propeller plane.

　　According to reports, a propeller-driven wheelless car was successfully tested by a Soviet youth designer in 1959. This car is equipped with two air compressors and a propeller, and it can travel on water, swamps, and even roads with landmines.

　　According to current data, the cost of a wheelless car is not much different from that of a wheeled car, but because it does not require axles, wheels, and tires, the maintenance cost is much cheaper than that of a wheeled car.

　　It is conceivable that wheelless cars will appear in our lives before long. At that time, when we get off work and take the bus home, we will no longer be riding in a car rolling on the ground, but riding on the air, "riding the wind home," as Su Shi wrote in his poem.

    无轮汽车地上飞
    王燮山
    汽车沿着公路飞驰。它的发动机发出的能量传给车轴，车轴通过轮胎给路面以作用力，路面反过来以反作用力推动汽车前进……。这是普通的有轮汽车行驶时的情景。轮子在这其中起了不小的作用。可是汽车有轮子和地面接触，也给它造成了不少的缺陷。首先是当它在前进时会受到地面对它的很大的阻力，尤其是当路面坎坷不平的时候，更是颠簸难行，从中白白地消耗了不少的能量。其次，当它在前进的路上碰到沼泽、水泽和其他难行的路途时，那简直就寸步难行了。由于这个缘故，人们在地球上为有轮汽车开辟了不少良好的公路，供它行驶。
    能不能不要轮子，设计一种无轮的汽车来克服现有汽车的缺点呢？这种想法很早就有一个科学家提出过。这位科学家就是著名的星际航行奠基人苏联科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基。他在晚年所写的一本书中提出了“无轮运输车”的想法。他谈到如果利用空气压缩机不断把空气压到汽车车厢底下，依靠空气的压力把车厢托起，再利用空气压缩机往后喷出空气，就能使汽车无需轮子而驾着空气在地面上飞行了。他从理论上说明托起车厢的空气压力并不需要很大，高压空气只要有十分之一个大气压力的残余压力就能使每平方米的车厢获得一吨的升力。
    根据这个想法，苏联工程师图尔金在1953年设计了一种无轮汽车。他设计的无轮汽车能把数百公斤的重物浮悬于空气中飞行。
    近几年来，无轮汽车已经引起了很多国家的注意与研究。研究与制造中的无轮汽车的型式虽然各有差异，但大都是利用空气压缩机喷出有压力的空气，在车厢与地面之间造成十厘米到三十厘米的空气垫，让车厢在空气垫上面行驶。
    至于使汽车前进的动力在目前则有二种，一种是利用空气压缩机向后喷射有压力的空气所产生的反作用推力使汽车前进，它的道理和喷气式飞机相似；另一种是在汽车上装上螺旋桨，利用螺旋桨转动时周围空气对它的反作用力来推动前进，它的道理和普通螺旋桨式飞机相似。
    根据报载，螺旋桨式无轮汽车在1959年已有一位苏联青年设计家试验成功。这种汽车上装有两部空气压缩机和一个螺旋桨，它能在水面上、沼泽上甚至在埋有地雷的路上行走。
    无轮汽车的造价根据目前的资料和有轮汽车相差不远，但是因为它无需车轴、轮子和轮胎，因此维护费用要比有轮汽车便宜得多。
    可以想像，过不了多久，无轮汽车将会在我们的生活中出现。到那时，每当我们下班乘车回家的时候，再也不是乘坐地面上滚动的汽车，而是驾着空气，像苏轼词中所说的“乘风归去”了。
