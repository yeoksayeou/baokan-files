Xinhua News Agency, January 19th, dispatch from Taipei: The "Military Paradise" (i.e., military brothels) established in Taiwan with "U.S. Aid" has recently seen another tragedy of forcing people to commit suicide. According to Taipei's "United Daily News," Yeh Chun-hsiang, a 17-year-old girl from Hsinchu County, Taiwan, and Chung Chi-chun, an 18-year-old, were abducted and sold to the Guandu "Military Paradise" in Taipei to work as prostitutes. Unable to bear the torment of this living hell, the two of them escaped from the military brothel and drowned themselves in the Tamsui River on the evening of the 8th of this month. A few days before their suicide, Yeh Chun-hsiang and Chung Chi-chun went to the Tamsui Police Station of the Chiang Kai-shek Group seeking protection and asking to be allowed to return to their hometowns. However, the Chiang Kai-shek police instead escorted them back to the military brothel, where they were subjected to cruel private torture by the pimps, who were Chiang's military officers.

These are just one or two of the thousands of tragedies that have occurred in military brothels throughout Taiwan in recent years. Some family members of deceased Chiang's military officers have also been imprisoned in military brothels, living inhuman lives. For example, in the Longgang "Military Paradise," there was a woman named Lin Ai-feng, whose husband was originally a major in Chiang's army, and she herself had been an elementary school teacher. However, after her husband died, officials from the political department of Chiang's army, under the pretext of "caring for the bereaved family of a military officer," lured her into selling herself in a military brothel. In this living hell, she was often "dealt with by the pimp with brutal means, and at the slightest disagreement, she would be beaten half to death," forcing Lin Ai-feng, "unable to bear the suffering, to quietly escape to the Zhongchang Bridge in Taipei one night and jump into the turbulent river to commit suicide."

The establishment of U.S. military brothels and Chiang Kai-shek's military brothels in various parts of Taiwan was proposed to the Chiang Kai-shek Group in 1951 by the U.S. military aid advisory group stationed in Taiwan, believing that this was a "good way" to adapt to the "American way of life" of the invading U.S. troops and maintain the morale of Chiang's army. The "construction costs" of the military brothels and the funds for abducting women in various parts of Taiwan to serve as prostitutes were paid for with "U.S. Aid" funds.

### 台湾美蒋军妓院残酷折磨妇女  不少妇女被逼身死

    台湾美蒋军妓院残酷折磨妇女
    不少妇女被逼身死
    据新华社19日讯　台北消息：台湾用“美援”设立的“军中乐园”（即军妓院）最近又发生逼人自杀的惨剧。据台北市“联合报”消息，台湾新竹县十七岁的少女叶春香和十八岁的钟其春，被人拐卖到台北关渡“军中乐园”当妓女。她两人因忍受不了这种人间地狱生活的摧残，在本月8日黄昏的时候，逃出军妓院到淡水河边投水自杀死去。叶春香两人在自杀前几天，曾到蒋介石集团淡水警察派出所要求保护，并且让她们回乡。但是，蒋介石警方反而把她们押解回军妓院，受到由蒋军军官充任的老鸨残酷的私刑折磨。
    这是近年来台湾各地军妓院中发生的成千件惨剧中的一二件。有一些蒋军死亡军官的家眷也被囚禁在军妓院中，过着非人的生活。如龙岗“军中乐园”有一名名叫林爱凤的妇女，丈夫原是蒋军少校军官，她本人也曾当过小学教员。但是，她的丈夫死后，蒋军政治部的官员竟以“照顾军官遗族”为理由，诱骗她到军妓院中卖淫。她在这个人间地狱中常常受到老鸨“残暴手段的对付，一言不合，就借故将她殴得死去活来”，逼使林爱凤“受苦不过，在一个深夜，悄悄逃到台北中场桥边，向着湍湍河流，一跃而下自杀”。
    在台湾各地分别建立美军军妓院和蒋军军妓院，是美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团在1951年向蒋介石集团提出的，认为这是适应侵台美军过惯“美国生活方式”和维持蒋军士气的一个“好办法”。军妓院的“建设费”和在台湾各地拐骗妇女充当妓女的经费，是由“美援”款项开支的。
