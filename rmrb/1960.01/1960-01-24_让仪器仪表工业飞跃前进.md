Let the Instrument and Meter Industry Leap Forward

Instruments and meters are the “ears and eyes” or “nerve center” of modern industrial and agricultural production and scientific and technological research. They are a crucial link in improving the mechanization, automation, and electrification of industry and agriculture, and in developing cutting-edge science and technology. To accelerate the modernization of our industry, agriculture, and science and culture, we must accelerate the development of the instrument industry.

In modern industry, especially in places where production takes place under conditions of high temperature, high pressure, high speed, high vacuum, and toxic or explosive environments, instruments and meters are indispensable tools for measuring and recording conditions, and adjusting or controlling production. For example, a large thermal power plant requires not only main units such as boilers, steam turbines, and generators, but also instrument equipment such as pressure gauges, temperature gauges, and automatic controls. The higher the level of mechanization and automation in the production process, the more instruments and meters are needed. In modern agriculture, instruments and meters are also widely used, such as in weather recording and testing and analysis of water conservancy, soil, fertilizers, and seeds. In scientific and technological research, especially in tackling advanced frontiers and reaching peaks, instruments and meters are even more essential tools. For example, the launching of artificial satellites and space rockets requires many accurate, sensitive, and precise instruments and meters. Therefore, instruments and meters are closely related to modern industry, agriculture, and science and culture.

In old China, the instrument and meter industry was basically a blank slate. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, with the continuous growth of the national economy, China's instrument and meter industry has gradually been established. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the instrument and meter industry has achieved leapfrog development, and has successfully trial-produced thousands of new products, many of which are advanced precision products. The development speed of China's instrument and meter industry is astonishing. However, this development speed is far from meeting the needs of the national economy and science and technology. Therefore, developing the instrument industry at high speed, constantly climbing to peaks, vigorously expanding varieties, continuously strengthening the foundation, and rapidly increasing output to meet the needs of various departments and scientific research units with more high-quality and low-priced products has become an urgent task for the current instrument and meter industry production.

How to complete this arduous and glorious task? Here, the most important thing is to mobilize everyone to run the instrument and meter industry, combine indigenous and foreign methods, and let it blossom everywhere. Tap the potential of schools and scientific research units. This can quickly expand varieties and increase output, and closely integrate with the requirements of use. There should be both professional division of labor and extensive collaboration, making full use of the strength of all parties.

In the future, the instrument industry should actively carry out standardization and serialization in its technical work. Meet more requirements with fewer varieties, first meet the urgently needed varieties of the national economy, fill gaps, and ensure the supporting of main units; at the same time, it should cooperate with scientific and technological research work, vigorously develop precision and cutting-edge products, and climb to peaks. All instrument and meter production departments should continue to carry out mass movements of technical innovation and technical revolution, strive to improve technical and management levels, increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, and increase labor productivity. Strengthen the production and research of special materials; strengthen metrology work, and continuously consolidate and expand the production position.

The current situation is very good. The Party's general line for building socialism has illuminated our road forward. As long as we adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to the mass line, implement the policy of "walking on two legs," exert full effort, strive for the upstream, China's instrument and meter industry will surely be able to leap forward at a higher speed.

    让仪器仪表工业飞跃前进
    仪器仪表是近代工农业生产和科学技术研究的“耳目”或“神经中枢”，是提高工农业机械化、自动化和电气化水平和发展尖端科学技术的重要环节。要加速我国工农业和科学文化的现代化，必须加速发展仪表工业。
    在近代工业中，特别是在高温、高压、高速、高真空和有毒害或易爆炸等条件下进行生产的地方，仪器仪表则是测量和记录情况、调节或控制生产不可缺少的工具。例如大型火力发电站，不仅要有锅炉、汽轮机和发电机等主机，而且必须装有压力表、温度表和自动调节等仪表设备。生产过程机械化、自动化水平愈高，就愈需要使用仪器仪表。在近代农业中，如气象记录和对水利、土壤、肥料、种籽等的测试分析，也都广泛使用仪器仪表。在科学技术研究工作中，特别是要攻尖端攀高峰，仪器仪表更是必需的工具。例如人造卫星和宇宙火箭的发射，就需要很多准确、灵敏和精密的仪器仪表。因此，仪器仪表和现代化工业、农业和科学文化有着很密切的关系。
    在旧中国，仪器仪表工业基本上是个空白点。解放后，在党和政府的领导下，随着国民经济不断的增长，我国的仪器仪表工业已逐步建立起来。特别是1958年大跃进以来，仪器仪表工业获得了飞跃的发展，并且试制成功了数以千计的新产品，其中不少是高级精密产品。我国仪器仪表工业发展速度是惊人的。然而，这个发展速度还远远不能适应国民经济和科学技术的需要，因此高速度发展仪表工业，不断攀登高峰，大力扩大品种，不断壮大基础，迅速增加产量，以更多物美价廉的产品满足各个部门和科学研究单位的需要，就成为当前仪器仪表工业生产的迫切任务。
    怎样去完成这个艰巨而又光荣的任务呢？这里，最重要的一条就是发动大家都来办仪器仪表，土洋结合，遍地开花。发掘学校和科学研究单位的潜力。这样既可迅速扩大品种，增加产量，又可密切和使用要求相结合。既有专业分工，又有广泛协作，充分运用各方面的力量。
    仪表工业今后在技术工作上应积极开展标准化和系列化。以较少的品种满足更多的要求，首先满足国民经济急需的品种，补缺门，保证主机的配套；同时应配合科学技术研究工作，大力发展精密尖端产品，攀登高峰。各仪器仪表生产部门，应继续大搞技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，努力提高技术水平与管理水平，增加产量，提高质量，降低成本和提高劳动生产率。加强特殊材料的生产和研究工作；加强计量工作，不断巩固和扩大生产阵地。
    当前的形势非常好。党的建设社会主义总路线照亮了我们前进的大道，只要我们坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线，贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，鼓足干劲，力争上游，我国的仪器仪表工业就一定能够以更高速度飞跃前进。
