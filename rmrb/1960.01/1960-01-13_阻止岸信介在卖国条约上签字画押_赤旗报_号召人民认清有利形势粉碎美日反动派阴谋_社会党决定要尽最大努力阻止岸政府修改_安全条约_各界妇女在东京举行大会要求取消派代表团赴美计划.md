Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 12th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" published a special edition today, exposing the aims of the US-Japan reactionaries in revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and calling on the Japanese people to strengthen unity and united action to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of this treaty.

The article pointed out that the US reactionaries are colluding with reactionaries from various countries to try to maintain the "Cold War" policy; the Japanese reactionary forces, centered on the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, are attempting to revise the "Security Treaty" to shoulder an important task for US imperialism in promoting the "Cold War" policy.

The article said that the revised new "Security Treaty" will strengthen the US-Japan military alliance against China and the Soviet Union, and its purpose is to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek group and the Syngman Rhee group to form a Northeast Asia military treaty organization.

"Akahata" said that Japan's industrial and mining production has increased three times since the war, but exports have remained at pre-war levels. Therefore, the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and Japanese monopoly capital are eagerly relying on US power to carry out economic aggression in Southeast Asia. If the conspiracy of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, which has this essence, to revise the "Security Treaty" succeeds, it will inevitably adopt even more blatant reactionary policies than before: carrying out economic expansion and aggression abroad; laying off workers at home, forcibly implementing a low-wage system, depriving the people of various rights, and forcibly revising the constitution.

"Akahata" went on to talk about the statements made by influential figures within the Liberal Democratic Party since the beginning of this year regarding opening up the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations after the revision of the "Security Treaty." The article said, "What kind of situation will emerge after the 'Security Treaty' is revised?" Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama said in response to questions at a Diet session that US troops could use Japan as a base to move against the coastal areas of China, Korea, and the Soviet Maritime Territory. This sentence exposed the true purpose of revising the "Security Treaty."

"Akahata" warned that if this is the case, Japan will face the danger of being drawn into a nuclear war against the Soviet Union and China. Revising the "Security Treaty" can only pose a serious threat to the safety, friendship, and happiness of the people of Asia and the world, including the Japanese people.

"Akahata" pointed out that these influential figures in the Liberal Democratic Party spread this kind of argument because they cannot openly oppose the common wishes and demands of the Japanese people. At the same time, they attempt to deceive the people with this fallacy, give the people illusions, and further avoid the people's attacks on the revision of the "Security Treaty."

"Akahata" emphasized that Nobusuke Kishi is increasingly isolated internationally, and the delegation led by him to the United States is surrounded by domestic opposition. The development of the situation in Japan and abroad in 1960 has brought more favorable conditions for the Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty." At present, as long as the Japanese people unite their will and actions to jointly deal with the conspiracies of the US and Japanese reactionaries, they will be able to break their conspiracies and will surely achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 12th: The Central Executive Committee of the Japan Socialist Party decided at a meeting held on the 11th that the Socialist Party will organize rallies and demonstrations on January 14th and 16th during the eleventh national unified action to prevent the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

The Socialist Party also decided to do its utmost to prevent the Diet from approving the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" scheduled to be signed on January 19th.

During the Diet debate, the Socialist Party will emphasize that the people do not trust this new US-Japan "Security Treaty." The Socialist Party will demand the establishment of "Security Treaty" special committees in both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors to ensure that the Diet conducts a full review of this new treaty.

Regarding the 1960 draft budget, the Socialist Party will point out to the Diet that this draft budget is a military budget that reduces the people's living standards. The Socialist Party will propose another budget drafted by the party.

The Socialist Party will accuse the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party of adopting a dictatorial attitude in the work of the Diet.

According to the decision, the goal of the Socialist Party's struggle in the Diet is to dissolve the House of Representatives and overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi government.

The Socialist Party will continue to struggle to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and conclude a Japanese-Soviet peace treaty, oppose the production of "Lockheed" jet fighters, and oppose attempts to persecute Socialist Party Secretary-General Inajiro Asanuma.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 12th: The Japan Women's Association for the Protection of National Human Rights held a conference in Tokyo today to oppose Nobusuke Kishi's signing of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" in the United States. This conference was called the "Mothers and Daughters Express Grief Conference." Three hundred women attended the conference, and there were also five hundred male listeners. The women all wore black armbands to attend the conference.

The conference unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the government cancel its plan to send a delegation to the United States to sign the "Security Treaty." The resolution said, "In the face of growing opposition across Japan, the government dares to forcibly sign a new treaty, which does not represent the will of the Japanese people."

The resolution stated that Japanese women are determined to fight for world peace and complete disarmament, and are determined to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty" because this treaty will harm relations with neighboring countries.

Many leaders of women's organizations spoke at the conference.

Kubu Shiro Rakkaku, president of the Japan Christian Women's Temperance Association, emphasized that the plan to revise the "Security Treaty" violates the spirit of the United Nations Charter. The United Nations Charter stipulates that all international disputes should be resolved by peaceful means. She emphasized, "We have a responsibility to make the whole of Japan and the world aware of the danger of revising the Security Treaty."

Commentator Sumiko Tanaka said that revising the "Security Treaty" will make Japan's neutrality impossible because it is forming a new military alliance.

She expressed regret over reports that Nobusuke Kishi intends to hold talks with Eisenhower on Japan's China policy. She said that this is another manifestation of Japan's submission to the United States.

Kiyo Yamanishi, the former mayor of Ogawa-machi who persisted in the struggle against the expansion of the military base in Ogawa-machi, said that she would continue to fight against the expansion of the base regardless of the difficulties.

Senators Naoko Takada and Michiko Fujiwara asked the participants to continue their efforts to expose the essence of the revision of the "Security Treaty" to a wider range of women.

Before the conference, a 100-member delegation from the Japan Women's Association for the Protection of National Human Rights went to the homes of Nobusuke Kishi and Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama to deliver letters of protest against the signing of the new "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 12th: Workers and people of other strata in various prefectures of Japan are actively preparing to participate in the eleventh national unified action against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" scheduled to be held from January 14th to 16th.

The Kyoto Local Council of Trade Unions of Japan notified its affiliated unions on the 11th of its plan to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty." According to this plan, on January 14th, 300 union members will request the Kyoto Prefectural Assembly to pass a resolution against the revision of the "Security Treaty." On the 15th, a mass rally will be held at the station, and a delegation of 250 people will be sent to Tokyo to protest to the Nobusuke Kishi government. On the 16th, the day Nobusuke Kishi departs for the United States to sign the new "Security Treaty," workers will hold rallies in their workplaces, and a mass rally and demonstration of 5,000 people will be held in Kyoto.

The people of Ehime Prefecture plan to hold protest rallies and bicycle demonstrations against the revision of the "Security Treaty." (Attached picture)

    阻止岸信介在卖国条约上签字画押
    “赤旗报”号召人民认清有利形势粉碎美日反动派阴谋
    社会党决定要尽最大努力阻止岸政府修改“安全条约”
    各界妇女在东京举行大会要求取消派代表团赴美计划
    新华社12日讯  东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天出版专刊，揭露美日反动派修改日美
  “安全条约”的目的，并且号召日本人民加强团结和统一行动来阻止修改和争取废除这项条约。
    文章指出，美国反动派勾结各国反动派图谋坚持“冷战”政策；以岸信介内阁为中心的日本反动势力企图修改“安全条约”，为美帝国主义推行“冷战”政策肩负重要任务。
    文章说，经过修改的新“安全条约”将加强以中苏为敌的日美军事同盟，而且它的目的在于勾结蒋介石集团和李承晚集团，组成东北亚军事条约组织。
    “赤旗报”说，战后日本工矿业生产已经增长到战前的三倍，但是出口却停留在战前的水平。因此，岸信介内阁和日本垄断资本正在急于依靠美国力量来向东南亚进行经济侵略。如果允许具有这种本质的岸信介内阁修改“安全条约”的阴谋得逞，它必定采取比以前更加露骨的反动政策：向外进行经济扩张和侵略；对内解雇工人、强制实行低工资制度、剥夺人民的各种权利、强行修改宪法。
    “赤旗报”接着谈到今年以来自由民主党内部有影响人士发表的关于要在实现修改“安全条约”以后打开日中关系僵局的谈话，文章说，“安全条约”修改之后究竟会出现怎样的局面呢？日本外务相藤山在国会会议上答复质问时曾经说，美军能够以日本为基地向中国沿海地带、朝鲜和苏联滨海边区出动。这句话暴露了修改“安全条约”真正的目的。
    “赤旗报”警告说，如果是这样，日本将面临被卷进以苏中为对手的核战争的危险局面。修改“安全条约”只能对包括日本人民在内的亚洲和全世界人民的安全、友好、幸福造成严重的威胁。
    “赤旗报”指出，这些自由民主党有影响人士所以散布这种论调，是因为他们不能公开反对日本人民共同的愿望和要求，同时他们企图以这种谬论来欺骗人民，对人民给以幻想，进一步避开人民对修改“安全条约”的攻击。
      “赤旗报”强调指出，岸信介在国际上日益孤立，以他为首的代表团的访美被国内反对的声浪所包围。1960年日本国内外形势的发展给日本人民反对修改“安全条约”的斗争带来了更有利的条件。在目前，只要日本人民把意志和行动统一和团结起来共同对付美日反动派的阴谋，是能够打破它们的阴谋的，并且一定能够取得最后胜利。
    新华社12日讯  东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员会在11日举行的会议上，决定社会党在阻止修改日美“安全条约”第十一次全国统一行动期间，在1月14日和16日组织大会和示威游行。
    社会党还决定尽最大努力阻止国会批准预定在1月19日签字的新的日美“安全条约”。
    在国会讨论期间，社会党将着重指出，人民不信任这个新的日美
  “安全条约”。社会党将要求在参、众两院都建立“安全条约”专门委员会以确保国会对这个新条约进行充分的审议。
    关于1960年的预算草案，社会党将向国会指出，这个预算草案是一个降低人民生活水平的军事预算。社会党将提出由这个党草拟的另一个预算案。
    社会党将指责岸信介政府和自由民主党在国会工作中采取的专制态度。
    据决定，社会党在国会中斗争的目的是解散众议院和推翻岸信介政府。
    社会党将继续进行斗争，争取恢复日中邦交和缔结日、苏和约，反对生产“洛克希德”式喷气战斗机，反对迫害社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎的企图。
   新华社12日讯  东京消息：日本拥护国民人权妇女协议会今天在东京举行大会，反对岸信介到美国签署新的日美“安全条约”。这个大会叫做“母亲和女儿表示悲愤大会”，参加大会的有三百名妇女，另外还有五百名男听众。妇女们都佩戴黑色的挽章来参加大会。
    大会一致通过决议，要求政府取消派代表团去美国签署“安全条约”的计划。决议说，“面对日本全国各地日益增长的反对，政府敢于强行签订新的条约，它并不代表日本人民的意志。”
    决议表示日本妇女决心为争取世界和平和全面裁军而斗争，决心反对修改“安全条约”，因为这个条约将损害同邻国的关系。
    许多妇女组织的领袖都在大会上讲了话。
    日本基督教妇女矫风会会长久布白落实强调说，修改“安全条约”的计划违反了联合国宪章的精神。联合国宪章规定，一切国际争端应当通过和平方法解决。她强调说，“我们有责任使全日本和全世界知道修改安全条约的危险性。”
    评论家田中寿美子说，修改“安全条约”将使日本的中立成为不可能，因为这是形成新的军事同盟。
    她对据说岸信介打算同艾森豪威尔就日本的对华政策举行会谈一事表示遗憾。她说，这是日本屈从美国的又一个表现。
    为反对在小川町扩大军事基地而坚持斗争的前小川町町长山西喜代说，她将不顾种种困难，继续为反对扩大基地而斗争。
    参议院议员高田尚子和藤原道子要求与会者继续努力，向广大的妇女揭露修改“安全条约”的实质。
    在大会之前，日本拥护国民人权妇女协议会的百人代表团到岸信介和外务相藤山爱一郎家里去，送交了反对签订新“安全条约”的抗议书。
    据新华社12日讯  东京消息：日本各县工人和其他各阶层人民正在积极准备参加预订在1月14日到16日举行的反对修改日美“安全条约”第十一次全国统一行动。
    日本工会总评议会京都地方评议会在11日把反对修改“安全条约”斗争的计划通知了它所属工会。根据这项计划，在1月14日，三百名工会会员将要求京都府议会通过反对修改“安全条约”的决议。在15日，将在车站举行群众集会，派遣由二百五十人组成的代表团去东京向岸信介政府提出抗议。在16日岸信介启程前往美国去签订新的“安全条约”这一天，工人们将在工作场所举行集会，并且在京都举行五千人的群众大会和示威游行。
