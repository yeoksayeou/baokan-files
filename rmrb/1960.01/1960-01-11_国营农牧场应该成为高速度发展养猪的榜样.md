State-run Farms and Ranches Should Become Role Models for High-Speed Pig Development

State-run farms and ranches possess even more favorable conditions for high-speed pig development and should become role models for the people's communes' high-speed development of pig production.

The pig production of state-run farms in Liaoning, Hebei, and Jilin provinces has increased by 1.5 to 2.5 times in one year, and they have provided the state with a large number of high-quality commercial pigs. The use of large amounts of pig manure instead of chemical fertilizers in agricultural production has greatly reduced production costs and increased yields. Also, the vigorous development of animal husbandry, primarily pig raising, has changed the economic structure of the farms, and the income from animal husbandry has greatly increased. Although these are only preliminary achievements in the past year, they fully demonstrate that state-run farms and ranches can not only become role models for high-speed pig production but are also very important for the country to establish commercial pig production bases.

What more favorable conditions do state-run farms and ranches have for high-speed pig development than the people's communes? First, they are state-owned economic units under the system of ownership by the whole people, which allows them to develop collective pig raising in a more planned and concentrated manner. Second, state-run farms and ranches generally have superior breeding pigs and a certain foundation of science and technology, as well as experience in scientific management. Third, state-run farms and ranches have more favorable material conditions such as funds, land, and equipment than the people's communes. Fourth, there is a strong and highly conscious agricultural workforce. Therefore, as long as these favorable conditions are fully utilized, state-run farms and ranches can develop pig production at a higher speed.

High-speed development of the pig-raising industry on state-run farms and ranches also requires launching mass movements and conscientiously implementing the principle of "walking on two legs." The first is the combination of "indigenous and foreign methods," combining the utilization of the existing scientific and technological foundation with the creativity of the workers. State-run farms and ranches in Hebei Province have launched a mass movement of "everyone contributing ideas, everyone finding solutions, one person making a proposal, and the collective studying and realizing it." This method combines the wisdom of the masses with the spirit of daring to think and act, and advanced science and technology. They used this method to create various experiences such as expanding piglet breeding, building simple earthen pigsties, using the four methods of "planting, collecting, grazing, and using" to solve feed problems, and accelerating fattening. Second, it is also necessary to "combine internal and external factors," that is, to combine the experiences within the farms with the advanced experiences of the people's communes outside the farms. Broadly collect the experiences of various people's communes in high-speed pig development, conduct scientific analysis and research, and comprehensively improve them. This way, the experience can be continuously improved, which can not only enrich the pig-raising movement of state-run farms but also guide pig raising in the people's communes.

Our state-run farms have always shouldered the task of providing the state with a large number of commercial grains, commercial pigs, and other commodity production bases, and they have also shouldered the task of providing the entire agricultural and animal husbandry production with excellent varieties, scientific and technical experience, and operational and management experience. They have played a very important role in supporting national economic construction and the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. Under the current new situation of high-speed pig development movement, the task is even more important. In addition to actively responding to the Party's call and developing pig raising at high speed, state-run farms should also take the lead and create good methods to promote how to rapidly expand the breeding of improved varieties, how to implement scientific operation and management, how to adopt scientific methods to open up a wide range of feed sources and processing, how to carry out epidemic prevention and sanitation work for collective pig raising, how to realize pig raising mechanization, semi-mechanization, and electrification under possible conditions, and many other key issues. This task is glorious and urgent. It is hoped that state-run farms and ranches in various places will adhere to putting politics in command, implement the principle of "walking on two legs," launch mass movements on a large scale, better complete the country's tasks, and provide the broad masses of people's communes with rich pig-raising experience.

    国营农牧场应该成为高速度发展养猪的榜样
    本报评论员
    国营农牧场具有高速度发展养猪更优越的条件，应该成为人民公社高速度发展养猪生产的榜样。
    辽宁、河北、吉林各国营农场养猪生产在一年内分别增长了一倍半到两倍半，并且为国家提供了大量质量高的商品猪；由于农业生产用大量猪肥代替了化肥，大大降低了生产成本，提高了产量；也由于以养猪为主大力发展畜牧生产，改变了农场的经济结构，畜牧业收入大大增加。所有这些，虽然还只是一年来的初步成绩，但它已充分说明，国营农牧场不仅可以成为高速度发展养猪生产的榜样，而且对于国家建立商品猪生产基地也是十分重要的。
    国营农牧场高速度发展养猪，比人民公社有哪些更优越的条件呢？首先，它是全民所有制的国营经济单位，可以更有计划、更集中力量地发展集体养猪；其次，国营农牧场一般都有优良种猪和一定的科学技术基础以及科学管理的经验；第三，国营农牧场有较人民公社更优越的资金、场地和设备等物质条件；第四，有强大的觉悟较高的农业职工队伍。因此，只要充分运用这些有利条件，国营农牧场就可以更高速度地发展养猪生产。
    国营农牧场高速度发展养猪事业，也需要大搞群众运动和认真贯彻两条腿走路的方针。首先是“土洋结合”，把利用现有的科学技术基础和发挥职工群众的创造性结合起来。河北省国营农牧场开展了“人人献计策，个个想办法，一人提议，集体研究实现”的群众运动，这样既能集思广益，又可使群众的敢想敢干精神和先进的科学技术相结合。他们用这种方法，创造了扩大仔猪繁殖，因陋就简建土圈，运用“种、采、牧、用”四法解决饲料问题和加速育肥等多种经验。其次，还必须“内外结合”，就是把场内的经验和场外各人民公社的先进经验结合起来。广泛搜集各人民公社高速度发展养猪的经验，加以科学分析研究，综合提高。这样就可以使经验益臻完善，既可丰富国营农场的养猪运动，又可指导人民公社养猪。
    我们的国营农场，一直是既担负着为国家提供大量商品粮、商品猪等商品生产基地的任务，又担负着为整个农牧业生产提供优良品种、科学技术经验和经营管理经验的试验场的任务，对支援国家经济建设和农牧业的发展，起了十分巨大的作用。在当前高速度发展养猪运动的新形势下，任务更加重大。除了本身积极响应党的号召，高速度发展养猪以外，对各地人民公社如何高速度扩大良种繁殖、如何实行科学的经营管理、如何采取科学方法多方面广辟饲料来源和进行加工、如何进行集体养猪的防疫卫生工作、如何实现养猪机械化半机械化以及可能条件下的电气化等许多关键性的问题，国营农场都应该充分利用自己的优越条件，先行一步，创造出好的办法，加以推广。这个任务是光荣而又迫切的，希望各地国营农牧场坚持政治挂帅，贯彻两条腿走路方针，大搞群众运动，更好地完成国家的任务，为广大人民公社提供丰富的养猪经验。
