    Small Reservoirs as Foundation, Large and Medium-Sized Reservoirs as Backbone
    Yuxi Prefecture Maximizes Overall Project Benefits
    (Our report) The large, medium and small-scale water conservancy projects and partial gravity irrigation systems built in Yuxi Prefecture, Yunnan Province, played a significant role in ensuring a bumper harvest of grain in 1959.
    In the past two years, Yuxi Prefecture has completed a total of forty-five large and medium-sized water conservancy projects and more than twelve thousand small-scale water conservancy projects. The earth dams of small reservoirs are generally more than twenty to thirty meters high, with a water storage capacity of two million to ten million cubic meters; the dams of large and medium-sized reservoirs are more than forty to fifty meters high, with a water storage capacity of more than fifty million to more than one hundred and twenty million cubic meters. All fifty-six people's communes in the district have built large and medium-sized reservoirs and grape-bunch-style medium and small-sized reservoir groups in the middle and upper reaches of more than twenty major rivers. With small-scale water conservancy as the foundation, large and medium-sized reservoirs can fully exert their benefits; with large and medium-sized reservoirs as the backbone, the disaster resistance capacity of small dams and ponds has also been greatly strengthened. The entire region controls more than 520 million cubic meters of water, which can not only guarantee water for early spring planting, but also use more than 120 million cubic meters of water to irrigate overwintering crops.
    During the spring plowing of 1959, there was little rain, and the gravity irrigation system released water to irrigate the fields, ensuring that 94% of the one million mu of rice in the entire region were planted before the Xiaoman solar term. In Jinning County, the gravity irrigation network composed of eighteen large and medium-sized backbone reservoirs, more than eight hundred small reservoirs, and seven canals with a total length of one hundred and twenty kilometers, enabled the county's two hundred thousand mu of rice to be planted one and a half solar terms earlier than in 1958.
    The amount of water required is especially large during the period when rice is budding and bearing spikes. If there is a drought at this time, the yield per mu will be reduced by one to two hundred jin of grain. Yuxi Prefecture has historically been prone to drought in the summer. In the summer of 1958, the entire region fought drought for nearly three months, using more than 20 million man-days of water lifting to save the seedlings from disaster. In the summer of 1959, it did not rain for more than forty consecutive days. At this time, people of all ethnic groups opened the gates of the region's fifty-four large and medium-sized reservoirs and more than ten thousand grape-bunch-style small reservoirs, and according to the principle of overall planning and taking all factors into consideration, ensuring key needs and the needs of the seedlings, they irrigated three or four times to protect the seedlings. The rice and flue-cured tobacco in the entire region were not affected by the disaster, and the phenomenon of manual water lifting for drought resistance was basically eliminated.
    While vigorously utilizing surface water to implement gravity irrigation, Yuxi Prefecture has also established two hundred and forty mechanical water lifting stations, irrigating one hundred and twenty-five thousand mu of farmland each year, which is equivalent to the benefits of twenty-five small reservoirs with a water storage capacity of two million cubic meters.
    Because the land was fully irrigated, coupled with the coordination of other measures, in 1959, the unit yield of grain in Yuxi Prefecture reached more than seven hundred jin, an increase of 13% compared with 1958; the total grain output increased by 16% compared with 1958.

    小型水库为基础　大中型水库为骨干
    玉溪专区发挥整体工程效益
    本报讯　云南省玉溪专区兴修的大、中、小型水利和部分地区的自流灌溉体系，在保证1959年粮食丰收中发挥了很大作用。
    两年来玉溪专区一共修成了四十五处大、中型水利工程，一万二千多处小型水利工程。小型水库的土坝一般高二十多米至三十多米，水库蓄水二百万立方米至一千万立方米；大、中型水库的坝高达四十多米至五十多米，蓄水五千多万立方米至一亿二千多万立方米。全区五十六个人民公社在二十多条主要河流的中上游，都修建了大、中型水库和葡萄串式的中、小型水库群。大、中型水库有了小型水利做基础，就能充分发挥效益；小型坝塘有了大、中型水库做骨干，抗灾的能力也大大加强了。全专区控制的水量达到五亿二千多万立方米，不仅能保证大春栽插用水，而且还能用一亿二千多万立方米的水灌溉小春作物。
    1959年春耕时少雨，自流灌溉系统放水灌田，保证了全专区一百万亩水稻94％都在小满节令前栽下了秧。晋宁县由十八个大、中型骨干水库、八百多个小型水库、全长一百二十公里的七条水渠组成的自流灌溉网，使全县二十万亩水稻比1958年提前一个半节令栽完了秧。
    水稻含苞孕穗这段时间，需要的水量特别大。这时候受旱，一亩地要少收一、二百斤粮食。而玉溪专区历年夏天都要发生旱象。1958年夏全区抗旱近三个月，用了二千多万个工车水才使禾苗免于受灾。1959年夏连续四十多天没有下雨。这时候，各族人民把全区五十四个大、中型水库和一万多个葡萄串式的小型水库的闸门打开，根据统筹兼顾，保证重点的原则和禾苗需要的情况，灌了三、四次保苗水，全区的水稻和烤烟都没有受灾，人工车水抗旱的现象也基本上消灭了。
    在大力利用地上水实行自流灌溉的同时，玉溪专区还建立了二百四十个机械提水站，每年提水灌溉十二万五千亩田地，相当于二十五个蓄水二百万立方米的小型水库的效益。
    由于土地得到了充分的灌溉，再加上其他各项措施的配合，1959年玉溪专区粮食的单位产量达到了七百多斤，比1958年增加了13％；粮食总产量比1958年增加了16％。
