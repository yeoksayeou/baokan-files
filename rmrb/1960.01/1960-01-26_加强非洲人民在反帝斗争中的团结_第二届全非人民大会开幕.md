Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, January 25th. The Second All-African People's Conference opened here this morning.

　　More than 140 representatives from 30 African countries attended the conference. They represent fifty political parties and mass organizations from Ghana, Algeria, Guinea, Congo, Tunisia, Nigeria, Morocco, Liberia, the United Arab Republic, Nyasaland, and other African countries.

　　Observers from eight other countries also attended the conference. Zhu Ziqi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council and Secretary-General of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, also attended the conference.

　　The conference was held in the Tunisian Trade Union Conference Hall, located on the shores of the deep blue Mediterranean Sea. In front of the hall, the national flags of independent African countries and African countries that will become independent this year fluttered in the sea breeze. The representatives were very excited to point to these national flags and say that it has only been a little more than a year since the Accra Conference, and more and more African countries' national flags have been raised. Representatives of those countries that have not yet become independent said with confidence that their national flags will soon fly together with these flags.

　　Inside the colorfully decorated conference hall, a torch on a map of Africa, the symbol of the conference, hung on the wall behind the podium. On the walls on both sides hung the conference slogan: "Independence and Unity." The national flags of independent African countries and countries that will become independent this year hung above the podium.

　　Ghanaian Minister of Economic Affairs, Kojo Botsio, was elected chairman of today's meeting. He declared the meeting open and hoped for its success.

　　Then, Tunisian President Bourguiba delivered a speech. He welcomed the convening of the conference and hoped that 1960 would be a year in which Africa would continue to move towards independence.

　　He emphasized the unity of Africa in the struggle for independence. He said that Africa was artificially divided by colonialists, and in order to realize the cause of African independence, all African countries should further unite and struggle.

　　Bourguiba pointed out that political independence is the decisive factor for economic and social independence.

　　He expressed support for the Algerian people's fight against imperialism. He condemned France's plan to conduct nuclear weapons tests in the Sahara.

　　A spokesperson for the conference pointed out that the purpose of this conference is to further strengthen the understanding and unity of the people of African countries, to accelerate the liberation of African people from the rule of imperialism and colonialism, to mobilize world public opinion to support the cause of African freedom, and to stipulate the means to achieve these goals. The spokesperson said that the conference agenda will mainly include the following issues: the independence of Africa (organizational work and methods for achieving African independence), neo-colonialism, anti-colonialism, economic and social development, and African unity (relations between African countries – diplomatic, transportation, commercial and cultural relations, etc.).

　　When the representatives, dressed in colorful national costumes, came to attend the meeting today, they cheered and embraced each other, and congratulated each other on the achievements they had made in the past year in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The representatives of fighting Algeria attracted all the people attending the meeting. They told representatives of other countries about their heroic battles against imperialist armies. Representatives from the Congo, Cameroon, and Nyasaland recounted the stories of their people fighting the imperialist armies with fists and stones. Representatives of independent countries told their brothers about their efforts to consolidate independence and build their motherlands.

　　The conference will be held for six days and will close on January 30.

　　A conference leaflet pointed out that since the Accra Conference, Africa has moved forward rapidly. In the east, west, south, north, and center of Africa, the people of Algeria, Congo, Cameroon, and Nyasaland have made continuous progress in the struggle for independence. The leaflet emphasized that the African people must further organize themselves to defeat all the conspiracies of the colonial countries, which are still trying to maintain their rule in various new ways, such as repression, division, feigning kindness, and deceptively modifying the various constraints imposed on their victims.

    大会是在位于深蓝色的地中海海滨的突尼斯工会会议厅内举行的。在大厅的前面，非洲独立国家和今年将要独立的非洲国家的国旗在海风中飘扬。代表们非常兴奋地指着这些国旗说，从阿克拉会议到现在，不过一年多一点，而越来越多的非洲国家的国旗已经升起来了。那些尚未独立的国家的代表们满怀信心地说，他们的国旗不久将同这些国旗在一起飘扬。
    在装饰得五彩缤纷的会议厅内，讲台后面的墙上挂着会议的标志——非洲地图上的一把火炬。在两边的墙上挂着会议的口号：“独立和团结”。非洲独立国家和今年将要独立的国家的国旗悬挂在讲台的上面。
    加纳经济部长科佐·博齐约当选为今天会议的主席。他宣布会议开始，并且希望会议成功。
    然后，突尼斯总统布尔吉巴发表演说。他欢迎会议的召开，并且希望1960年将是非洲朝着独立继续前进的一年。
    他强调非洲在争取独立的斗争中的团结。他说，非洲是被殖民主义者人为地分裂的，为了实现非洲独立的事业，所有的非洲国家应当进一步团结起来进行斗争。
    布尔吉巴指出，政治独立是经济和社会独立的决定性因素。
    他表示支持阿尔及利亚人民对帝国主义的战斗。他谴责法国计划在撒哈拉进行原子弹试验。
    大会发言人指出，这次会议的目的是进一步加强非洲各国人民的了解和团结，加速使非洲人民从帝国主义和殖民主义的统治下解放出来，动员世界舆论支持非洲自由事业，规定实现这些目的的手段。发言人说，会议议程主要将包括以下问题，非洲的独立（实现非洲独立的组织工作和方法），新殖民主义，反殖民主义，经济和社会发展以及非洲团结（非洲国家之间的关系——外交、运输、商业和文化关系等等）。
    穿着多彩的民族服装的代表们今天来参加会议时，互相欢呼和拥抱，并且互相祝贺他们在过去的一年中在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中所取得的成就。战斗的阿尔及利亚的代表们吸引了参加会议的所有的人。他们向其他国家代表谈到他们对帝国主义军队进行的英勇战斗。刚果、喀麦隆、尼亚萨兰的代表们讲述了他们国家的人民用拳头和石头同帝国主义军队作战的事迹。独立国家的代表们对他们的兄弟谈到了他们巩固独立和建设他们祖国的努力。

    大会的传单指出，自从阿克拉会议以来，非洲已经迅速地向前迈进。在非洲的东、西、南、北和中部，阿尔及利亚、刚果、喀麦隆、尼亚萨兰的人民，在争取独立的斗争中取得了不断的进展。传单强调说，非洲人民必须进一步地组织自己，击败殖民国家的一切阴谋，这些殖民国家仍然力图用各种新的方式，如进行镇压、分化、装出慈爱的态度、骗人地修改强加在它们的受害者身上的各种束缚等等，来维持它们的统治。
