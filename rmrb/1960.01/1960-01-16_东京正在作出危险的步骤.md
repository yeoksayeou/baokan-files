    Tokyo is Taking Dangerous Steps
    Editor's Note: The Soviet "Izvestia" published an article on January 7th commenting on the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," titled "Tokyo is Taking Dangerous Steps." Before the article, a brief report from TASS Tokyo on January 6th was published. This report stated, "Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama and U.S. Ambassador Douglas MacArthur II held their final meeting today on the revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi will go to the United States on January 16th to sign the new draft treaty." The full text of the "Izvestia" commentary is as follows:
    The above news from Tokyo contains a dangerous decision by the Japanese government that threatens the interests of the Japanese nation and the cause of peace in Asia. This decision by the Japanese government goes against the will of its own people, whose representatives, by the millions, have long actively opposed the revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.
    No matter what kind of beautiful cloak this treaty is dressed in, its essence remains: to tie Japan even more tightly to the American war chariot, to make Japan join a military bloc, and to maintain American military bases on Japanese territory. It is quite obvious that this course runs counter to the spirit of the times, and it holds dangerous consequences for Japan.
    Negotiations to revise the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty have continued for one year and four months. The reason for such a long period is not so much the existence of fundamental differences between the official representatives of the United States and Japan, but rather that the Japanese ruling clique hoped to force Japanese public opinion to compromise with the government's policy against the interests of the nation by prolonging the negotiations. Obviously, it is impossible to achieve this. It is no accident that Japanese leaders have decided to submit the text of the new treaty to the government for approval without submitting it to the Diet for discussion.
    However, there is no doubt that the Japanese people will intensify their struggle against policies harmful to Japan.
    In his reply to the letters from representatives of Japanese public opinion, news agencies, and newspapers, N.S. Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, pointed out that "the interests of the Japanese people are different from the interests of those who are trying to push Japan onto the dangerous road of revanchism and the arms race." Japanese public opinion clearly sees that in the current situation where international tensions have begun to ease, and on the eve of important negotiations on mature international issues, any action that could create new obstacles to establishing mutual understanding between countries will inevitably be universally condemned.
    The task facing Japan, like the task facing all countries, should be to make its own contribution to easing international tensions and promoting the consolidation of world peace. However, the Japanese ruling clique is doing the opposite; it is making Japan even more subservient to U.S. imperialism. Therefore, it bears a heavy responsibility to the Japanese people. They are acting against reason.

    东京正在作出危险的步骤
    编者按：苏联“消息报”7日发表了一篇评修改日美“安全条约”的文章，题目是“东京正在作出危险的步骤”。文章之前，刊登了塔斯社东京1月6日电头的一篇简短报道。这篇报道中说，“日本外务相藤山爱一郎和美国大使麦克阿瑟第二今天就修改日美安全条约问题举行了最后一次会晤，日本首相岸信介将于1月16日带着新的条约草案前往美国签字”。“消息报”的评论全文如下：
    上面这一则来自东京的消息中，包含着日本政府威胁日本民族利益，威胁亚洲和平事业的危险决定。日本政府的这个决定是违反本国人民意志的，千千万万的日本人民的代表长期以来积极反对修改日美安全条约。
    不论这个条约披上了什么样的漂亮外衣，这个条约的实质仍然是：把日本更紧地绑在美国的战车上，使日本加入军事集团，并在日本领土上保持美国军事基地。十分明显，这种路线与时代精神是背道而驰的，它对日本蕴藏着危险的后果。
    修改日美安全条约的谈判继续了一年零四个月。需要这么长的日期，与其说是因为美国和日本的官方代表之间存在着根本分歧，不如说是因为日本统治集团希望以延长谈判来强使日本舆论界对政府的违反本民族利益的方针妥协。要作到这点显然是不可能的。日本领导人只决定把新条约的条文送给政府批准，而不把它送交国会讨论的作法不是偶然的。
    但是，不必怀疑，日本人民将加强反对有害于日本的政策的斗争。
    苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在回答日本舆论界、通讯社和报刊代表的信件中指出，“日本人民的利益同那些企图把日本推到复仇主义和军备竞赛的危险道路上去的人的利益是分歧的。”日本舆论界看得很清楚，在目前国际紧张局势已经现出缓和的形势下，在即将对成熟了的国际问题进行重要谈判的前夕，任何能对建立国与国之间相互谅解造成新障碍的行动都不可避免地会受到普遍的谴责。
    日本面临的任务同所有国家面临的任务一样，应该对国际局势的缓和和促进世界和平的巩固作出自己的贡献。可是，日本统治集团与此相反，它使日本更加俯首于美帝国主义。因此，它对日本人民负有严重的责任。他们这样作是违背理智的。
