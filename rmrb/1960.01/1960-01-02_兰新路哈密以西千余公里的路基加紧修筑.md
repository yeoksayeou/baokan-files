Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, January 1st: The roadbed, stretching over a thousand kilometers from Hami via Urumqi to the national border on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, is being intensively constructed despite the severe cold. Currently, the main works including the roadbed and bridge culverts on the more than 500-kilometer section from Hami to Urumqi have been basically completed, with the bottom ballast stones laid on 70% of the line. In the Daban City area east of Urumqi, all twelve tunnel projects penetrating the Tianshan Mountains have been completed. The key bridge culvert, tunnel, and roadbed earthwork and stonework projects from Urumqi to the national border have also been largely completed.

The construction of the section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway from Urumqi to the national border remains very arduous. In addition to the twelve Tianshan tunnels already completed, the railway must also pass through the Aibi Lake marsh area, which stretches for twenty kilometers and is constantly seeping water. At present, the railway construction workers are braving the severe cold of around minus thirty degrees Celsius to conquer this marsh area.

In the suburbs of Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the large-scale Urumqi railway hub project, consisting of five stations including Urumqi Station, Urumqi North Station, and Xishan marshalling station, is also under intensive construction.

    兰新路哈密以西千余公里的路基加紧修筑
    据新华社乌鲁木齐1日电　兰新铁路从哈密经乌鲁木齐到国境线的长达一千多公里的路基，正在严寒里加紧修筑。目前，哈密到乌鲁木齐的五百多公里路基、桥涵等主体工程已经基本结束，有70％的线路上铺设了底碴石。在乌鲁木齐以东达坂城地区，铁路穿越天山的十二座隧道工程已全部结束。从乌鲁木齐到国境的重点桥涵、隧道、路基土石方工程也已大部完成。
    兰新铁路从乌鲁木齐到国境这一段的工程仍然很艰巨。除已完工的十二座天山隧道外，铁路还要经过绵延二十公里、终年渗水的艾比湖沼泽地区。目前，筑路员工正冒着零下三十度左右的严寒，征服这个沼泽区。
    在新疆维吾尔自治区首府——乌鲁木齐的市郊，由乌鲁木齐车站、乌鲁木齐北站、西山编组站等五个车站组成的规模宏大的乌鲁木齐铁路总枢纽工程，也在加紧建设中。
