This is a wonderful spring, with bright sunshine, joyous rivers and mountains, and resounding triumphant songs. The 600 million people, on their journey to scale the peak, have once again victoriously crossed the predetermined height and have greatly surpassed it. At the place where we victoriously converge, the red flags are like a sea, fluttering in the wind. They are the red flags of the industrial sector that completed the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, the red flags of agriculture that achieved a bumper harvest, the red flags of great development in education, science, and culture, and the winning red flags of millions of advanced producers and advanced workers in all walks of life. And in this sea of red flags, there is one red flag that is the highest, largest, and most vibrant, and that is the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. It is a commander's flag, a source of infinite hope and strength in the hearts of the people.

The commander's flag waves on our road forward; the commander's flag waves in the hearts of 600 million heroic people.

High speed is the soul of the general line for socialist construction. Where does high speed come from? It comes from the superiority of the socialist system and from the revolutionary zeal of the people. Without the revolutionary zeal of the broad masses, socialist construction is out of the question, and high speed is even more out of the question. But where does revolutionary zeal come from? It comes from the socialist ideological consciousness and lofty aspirations of the people. Revolution and construction are the conscious actions of millions upon millions of people; the socialist ideological consciousness and lofty aspirations of the broad masses are the decisive factors in socialist construction.

Revolutionary ideals are the driving force for people to participate in the revolution. The greater the ideal and the higher the awareness, the more the revolutionary zeal can be brought into play. Therefore, Marxist parties have always attached great importance to ideological education for the masses. The masses are the creators of history and have infinite wisdom and power. If the broad masses do not have revolutionary ideological consciousness, the revolution cannot succeed. In the past, under the leadership and education of the proletarian party, the broad masses participated in the democratic revolution with the revolutionary goal of overthrowing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism. After overthrowing the three great mountains weighing down on the Chinese people, the previous revolutionary goal obviously needs to be raised a step further to give them socialist-communist revolutionary goals and ideological awareness. Only in this way can we encourage them to participate in the cause of socialist construction and enable the revolution to move forward without hesitation.

Our broad masses of people, under the teachings of the Party and the great leader Mao Zedong, have the ambition to build socialism. However, even with ambition, there is still a need for a concrete path forward. At this time, our Party and Chairman Mao quickly formulated the general line for socialist construction for us, and then found the speed of the Great Leap Forward and the organizational form of the People's Commune for us. Thus, we followed the correct line, fully opened the throttle, and sped towards the fully recognized destination.

From the day it announced its establishment, our Party has held high the bright and dazzling commander's flag of the proletariat. After Mao Zedong Thought, which specifically applied Marxism-Leninism to the reality of the Chinese revolution, illuminated our road forward, we moved forward even more courageously and victoriously, causing the revolution to continuously move from victory to victory. Comrade Mao Zedong is best at grasping the essence of things, seeing the development of objective situations, and proposing the most correct and perfect principles, policies, and lines based on the demands of the broad masses. The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is our glorious and great commander's flag in revolution and construction. Wherever the commander's flag points, the red flags flutter. This commander's flag that changes the situation guides the revolution and construction from victory to victory. The liberated people, under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, are high-spirited and vigorous. Their great wisdom and strength have burst forth with brilliant light, enabling our cause to have a greater leap in the past two years than in the early days of liberation. The emergence of this greater miracle is the result of the 650 million people fully developing their subjective initiative under the leadership of the Party. This is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party last year, through opposing rightism and boosting morale, people cleared the way forward for the continuous Great Leap Forward. The people's consciousness was raised to an unprecedented level, unity was unprecedentedly consolidated, and they were in a happy mood and full of energy, realizing a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the development of the national economy with both high speed and proportion. This once again eloquently proves that holding high the commander's flag of Mao Zedong Thought will generate earth-shattering and lasting great strength.

In the revolutionary war, the flag bearer always held high the red flag of the proletariat in the front. The red flag is the people's hope and strength. With the red flag in front, people closely followed it, charging into the enemy's陣地,攻下了一个又一个的碉堡, and won victory. In the socialist revolution and construction, our flag bearer—Comrade Mao Zedong—always held high the red flag of Marxism-Leninism. The red flag is always our hope and strength. With the red flag in front, people closely followed it, overcoming one difficulty after another on the road forward and advancing rapidly. With the commander's flag held high and the red flags fluttering, everything that blocks the way and all demons and monsters are smashed. Hold high the commander's flag and advance!

    帅旗飘飘
    梅原
    这是一个大好春天，阳光灿烂，河山欢笑，凯歌声震动天地，六亿人民在攀登高峰的征途上，又一次胜利地跨过了预定的高度，而且大大超过去了。在我们胜利会师的地方，红旗似海，迎风招展。它们是工业部门提前三年完成第二个五年计划的红旗，是农业获得大丰收的红旗，是教育科学文化事业大发展的红旗，是各行各业中千百万个先进生产者和先进工作者的优胜红旗。而在这红旗的海洋中，有一面红旗最高、最大、最鲜红，那就是毛泽东思想的红旗。它是一面帅旗，是人们心目中无穷的希望和力量的源泉。
    帅旗，在我们前进的道路上飘扬；帅旗，在六亿英雄人民的心头飘扬。
    高速度是社会主义建设总路线的灵魂。高速度从何而来？从社会主义制度的优越性而来，从人们的革命干劲而来。没有广大人民的革命干劲，社会主义建设谈不上，高速度更谈不上。然而革命干劲又从何而来？从人们的社会主义思想觉悟和雄心壮志而来。革命和建设，是千百万群众自觉的行动；广大人民的社会主义思想觉悟和雄心壮志，是社会主义建设的决定因素。
    革命的理想，是人们参加革命的动力，理想愈大，觉悟愈高，愈能发挥出革命的干劲。所以，马克思主义政党从来就十分重视对人民群众进行思想教育。群众是历史的创造者，有着无穷的智慧和力量。如果广大人民没有革命的思想觉悟，革命是不可能成功的。过去广大群众，在无产阶级政党的领导和教育下，抱着打倒帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义这样的革命目标，参加了民主主义革命。而在推翻了压在中国人民身上的三座大山后，先前的那种革命目标，显然需要提高一步，使他们具有社会主义——共产主义的革命目标和思想觉悟。只有这样，我们才能鼓舞他们去参加社会主义的建设事业，使革命毫不停顿地向前发展。
    我们广大人民，在党和伟大领袖毛泽东的教导下，有着建设社会主义的雄心壮志。然而有了雄心壮志，也还需要前进的具体道路。这时，我们的党和毛主席，又很快地为我们制定了社会主义建设的总路线，继而又为我们找到了大跃进的速度和人民公社的组织形式，于是我们沿着正确的路线，开足马力，向着充分认清了的目的地飞奔前去。
    我们的党从它宣布成立的第一天起，就高举起鲜艳夺目的无产阶级的帅旗；而在把马克思列宁主义具体地运用到中国革命实际的毛泽东思想照耀了我们前进的道路后，我们更是一往无前，所向披靡，使革命不断地从胜利走向胜利。毛泽东同志最善于根据广大人民的要求，最善于看到事物的本质，最善于把握客观形势的发展，提出最正确最完善的方针、政策、路线。毛泽东思想的红旗，是我们革命和建设中的光荣的伟大的帅旗。帅旗所指，红旗飘扬。这杆使风云变色的帅旗，引导着革命和建设从胜利走向胜利。解放了的人民，在毛泽东思想的照耀下，意气风发，龙腾虎跃，他们的伟大智慧和力量，迸发出了灿烂的光辉，使我们的事业，在近两年来有了比解放初期更大的飞跃。这更大奇迹的出现，是六亿五千万人民在党的领导下充分地发挥了主观能动性的结果。这是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    去年党的八届八中全会后，经过反右倾、鼓干劲，人们为连续大跃进扫清了前进的道路，广大人民觉悟空前提高，团结空前巩固，心情愉快，干劲十足，实现了国民经济发展的又高速度又按比例的全面大跃进的局面。这就再一次雄辩地证明：高举毛泽东思想帅旗，会产生多么惊天动地、持久不衰的伟大力量。
    在革命战争中，旗手总是在前面高举着无产阶级的红旗。红旗是人们的希望和力量。红旗在前，人们紧紧地跟着它冲向敌阵，攻下了一个又一个的碉堡，获得了胜利。在社会主义革命和建设中，我们的旗手——毛泽东同志总是高举着马克思列宁主义的红旗。红旗永远是我们的希望和力量。红旗在前，人们紧紧地跟着它克服了前进道路上一个又一个的困难而迅速前进。帅旗高举，红旗飘扬，粉碎了一切拦路石和妖魔鬼怪。高举帅旗前进！
