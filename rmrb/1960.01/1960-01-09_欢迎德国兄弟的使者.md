    Following the joint celebration of the tenth anniversaries of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign and Intra-German Trade, Heinrich Rau, will arrive in our country today for a friendly visit. The Chinese people warmly welcome the arrival of the envoys of our German brothers. At a time when the socialist camp, led by the Soviet Union, is more united, and the friendship between China and Germany is further strengthened, we firmly believe that the visit of the distinguished guests from the German Democratic Republic will make a significant contribution to the further development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.

    Since the signing of the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in 1955, this friendship has grown and strengthened with the continuous mutual visits of party and government leaders of the two countries, and the increasingly close economic and cultural ties. In the cause of socialist construction, we have provided each other with great assistance and conducted sincere cooperation. In 1959, the trade volume between the two countries increased more than threefold compared to 1951. The German Democratic Republic has provided China with more than 50 construction projects with complete sets of equipment, supplied various instruments and other means of production, and sent many skilled experts to assist in the work. China has also supplied the German Democratic Republic with many materials needed for developing production and improving the people's livelihood. In recent years, the friendly exchanges between the people of our two countries have become increasingly frequent. Last year, the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, visited China and held talks with the Chinese government delegation. Both sides reaffirmed that their views on the international situation were completely consistent, and that they would support and encourage each other in the struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and the German people for the peaceful reunification of Germany. When our two countries celebrated the tenth anniversary of their founding, we sent party and government delegations to each other to convey the brotherly congratulations and friendship between the people of the two countries. The profound friendship and firm unity between the Chinese and German people cannot be destroyed by any force.

    In the ten years since its founding, the German Democratic Republic has unremittingly defended the cause of peace in Europe and the world. This first worker-peasant regime in German history is completely different from any government in German history, and it has become a strong bastion of peace. The German Democratic Republic stands at the forefront of opposing the revival of West German militarism, resolutely opposes the activities of Western countries to deepen the division of Germany and undermine European peace, and fully supports all efforts of the Soviet government to ease international tensions. Because of its consistent adherence to the banner of peace, the international prestige of the German Democratic Republic is growing day by day. The reactionary governments of the United States and West Germany once vainly attempted to strangle and subvert the German Democratic Republic, obliterate its existence, and attempted to isolate the German Democratic Republic internationally through diplomatic blockade. But all their conspiracies have failed shamefully. The German Democratic Republic not only exists, but its strength is growing. It has established trade relations with more than 100 countries and regions. Last year, the German Democratic Republic sent government delegations and People's Chamber delegations to visit many Asian countries, and was warmly welcomed. At last year's Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, the United States, Britain, and France had to sit down with representatives of the German Democratic Republic, which they had always considered non-existent, to discuss issues related to Germany. This proves that it is impossible to ignore the existence of the German Democratic Republic internationally.

    For a long time, the German Democratic Republic has waged a tireless struggle for the peaceful reunification of its homeland and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Facts show that it is the true representative and defender of the national interests of the German people. Now, under the pressure of world public opinion, Western countries have had to agree to hold an East-West summit with the Soviet Union. There is reason for people to demand that the United States and its main partners, who claim to be willing to seek peace, should no longer obstruct the solution of the German question. According to Western news agencies, Western countries are preparing to obstruct the German Democratic Republic from participating in discussions on the German question by having West Germany not attend the summit. Prime Minister Grotewohl issued a statement on the 14th of last month stating that participation in all discussions concerning the national interests of the German nation is an inalienable right of the German nation. Prime Minister Grotewohl also pointed out that if Adenauer were to give up attending the summit, then the government of the German Democratic Republic would speak on behalf of the citizens of the German Democratic Republic and the whole of Germany. This is completely reasonable, and Western countries have no reason to refuse it.

    The visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Heinrich Rau, to China will undoubtedly help to deepen the understanding between the two countries. We will regard this visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic as the first flower of the further development of Sino-German friendship in the 1960s. It will leave a lasting fragrance in the friendly history of China and Germany.

    欢迎德国兄弟的使者
    在中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国共同庆祝两国伟大的国庆十周年后不久，以德意志民主共和国副总理、对外与东西德贸易部长海因里希·劳为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团又将在今天到我国进行友好访问。中国人民热烈欢迎德国兄弟的使者的光临。在今天以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加团结，中德两国友谊更加加强的时候，我们深信，德意志民主共和国的贵宾们的来访对进一步发展两国友好合作关系将作出重大的贡献。
    自从1955年中德两国缔结了中德友好合作条约之后，随着两国党政领导人不断互相访问，以及两国经济、文化上的联系日益密切，这种友谊越来越发展和加强。我们在社会主义建设的事业中，互相给予了大力的援助，进行了真诚的合作。1959年两国的贸易额较1951年增加了三倍多。德意志民主共和国为我国提供设计和供应成套设备的建设项目有五十多个，向我国提供了各种仪器和其他生产资料，并派来许多技术精湛的专家协助工作。我国也供应了德意志民主共和国不少为发展生产和改善人民生活所需要的物资。几年来，我们两国人民的友好往来是越来越频繁了。去年以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问我国，同我国政府代表团进行了会谈，双方重申，对国际局势的看法完全一致，并且在中国人民解放台湾和德国人民为和平统一德国的斗争中相互支持和激励。当我们两国建国十周年的时候，双方又互派了党政代表团，传达了两国人民互相间兄弟般的祝贺和友情。中德两国人民的深厚友谊和坚强团结是任何力量都不能够破坏的。
    在建国以来的十年中，德意志民主共和国不懈地捍卫着欧洲和世界的和平事业。这个德国历史上第一个工农政权的国家，和德国历史上的任何一个政府完全不同，它已是一个坚强的和平堡垒。德意志民主共和国站在反对复活西德军国主义的最前线，坚决反对西方国家加深德国分裂破坏欧洲和平的活动，并全力支持苏联政府一切缓和国际紧张局势的努力。由于它一贯坚持和平的旗帜，德意志民主共和国的国际威望一天天提高。美国和西德反动政府曾经妄想扼杀和颠覆德意志民主共和国，抹煞它的存在，并且企图用外交封锁来使德意志民主共和国在国际上孤立起来。但是它们的一切阴谋诡计都已可耻地失败了。德意志民主共和国不仅存在着，而且力量日益壮大。它已经同一百多个国家和地区建立了贸易关系。去年德意志民主共和国曾派出政府代表团和人民议院代表团，访问了许多亚洲国家，受到了热烈的欢迎。在去年的日内瓦外长会议上，美、英、法三国也不得不坐下来同它们一直认为不存在的德意志民主共和国的代表讨论有关德国的问题。这证明，要想在国际上无视德意志民主共和国的存在是办不到的。
    长期以来，德意志民主共和国为争取祖国的和平统一，争取缔结对德和约，进行了始终不倦的斗争。事实表明它是德国人民民族利益的真正代表和捍卫者。现在西方国家在世界舆论压力下，已经不得不同意和苏联举行东西方最高级会议了。人们有理由要求口口声声表示愿意谋求和平的美国和它的主要伙伴，不要再继续阻挠德国问题的解决。据西方通讯社透露，西方国家准备以西德不出席最高级会议来阻挠德意志民主共和国参加关于德国问题的讨论。格罗提渥总理已在上月14日发表声明表示，参加所有有关德国民族利益的问题的讨论，是德国民族不可被剥夺的权利。格罗提渥总理还指出，如果阿登纳要放弃参加最高级会议，那么，德意志民主共和国政府就将代表德意志民主共和国公民和整个德国发言。这是完全合情合理的，西方国家是没有任何理由加以拒绝的。
    以海因里希·劳副总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团在中国的访问，无疑会有助于加深两国之间的了解。我们将把这次德意志民主共和国政府代表团的来访，看作是六十年代中德友谊进一步发展的第一束花朵。它将在中德两国友好历史上，留下永不消逝的芬芳。
