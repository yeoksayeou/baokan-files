The head of the diplomatic corps, Bulgarian Ambassador Khalov, then spoke on behalf of the diplomatic missions of various countries.

He expressed his belief that the Vietnamese people, supported by the socialist countries led by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving and freedom-loving people of the world, will certainly drive U.S. imperialism out of the southern territory of Vietnam.
