Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 31st, TASS dispatch: Soviet Minister Chairman Khrushchev's reply to representatives of the Japanese public, news agencies and the press:

I have received letters from some Japanese social organizations, news agencies, newspapers, editorial offices of radio and television stations, and some individuals. These letters express friendly and affectionate feelings towards the Soviet people, and also hope to receive answers to some questions concerning the international situation and Soviet-Japanese relations.

The letters received include those from: Mr. Hara Shigeru, Chairman of the Japan Coal Miners' Union, Mr. Kuga, Director of the Kyodo News Agency Editorial Bureau, Mr. Suzuki, Director of the "Chubu Nippon Shimbun" Editorial Bureau, Mr. Adachi, General Manager of Nippon Television Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Kojima, Director of the "Yomiuri Shimbun" Editorial Bureau, and Mr. Wada, Director of the "Asahi Shimbun Weekly" Editorial Bureau, among others.

I have also received enthusiastic letters from the Hachirogata Town Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and a group of workers from the Kagoshima and Oguchi City Telegraph Bureaus.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to write back to all the organizations and individuals who sent letters. I would like to first thank them for their kindness, and on behalf of the Soviet people and myself, extend my sincere greetings and best New Year wishes to all the Japanese people.

On the eve of the new year of 1960, it is gratifying to point out that the year that is about to pass has marked a significant warming of the international climate. A wider and wider range of residents, as well as social activists, parliamentary and state activists, have realized that the "Cold War," the arms race, the stockpiling of nuclear weapons and other means of mass destruction are unwise and dangerous. The "position of strength" policy has never brought good fortune to anyone. If anyone continues this policy in disregard of common sense, it will only lead to the outbreak of a war using the most destructive weapons of mass destruction, causing enormous damage to material and spiritual wealth.

In this situation, it is comforting that: now even in those countries that not long ago regarded threatening with atomic bombs and walking a tightrope on the brink of war as fashionable, the sentiment in favor of eliminating international tension and resolving disputes through negotiation is gradually strengthening. The meetings and talks between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the leaders of the United States, Britain and other countries in 1959 played an important role in this regard. An agreement has now been reached on a meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France in the spring of 1960. The Soviet Union expects to take joint steps at this meeting to find ways to reach agreement on disarmament and other pressing international issues. The Soviet government will do everything possible to ensure the success of the meeting.

It seems that a clearer assessment of the current situation has begun to prevail, and the principle of peaceful coexistence is increasingly established in international life. The ice of the "Cold War" has thawed, which gives the people of all countries great hope. Of course, the achievements already made should not be overestimated. This is only the beginning, but it is a good beginning, which can and should be further developed in the interests of peace.

The Soviet Union is steadfastly making every effort to achieve agreements through negotiations to ensure the peaceful coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation of countries with different social systems. The Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, put forward at the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 1959, is to achieve this lofty goal. If all armed forces are dissolved, nuclear weapons are completely banned and their stockpiles are destroyed, military bases in other countries are abolished, general staff headquarters and military departments are dissolved, and if all soldiers go home, then no country will have the means to wage war. In this way, huge material and human resources can no longer be wasted on destructive rather than constructive purposes. Then, lasting and reliable peace will become a reality. Under such peaceful conditions, all scientific, technological, and industrial means—all productive forces—can be used to improve people's lives, to eliminate economic and cultural backwardness, and to benefit people rather than harm them.

The Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament has been endorsed by the United Nations and has received a good response in countries around the world. Mr. Hara Shigeru, Chairman of the Japan Coal Miners' Union, said in his letter that hundreds of thousands of Japanese miners, like all peace advocates, are grateful to the Soviet government for its tireless efforts to defend peace and for its disarmament proposals. Mr. Wada, the editor-in-chief of "Asahi Shimbun Weekly," said that the Soviet government has made "outstanding contributions to the cause of easing international tensions." We are pleased that the Soviet government's efforts have been endorsed and supported by all sectors of Japanese society.

The Soviet people have always stood at the forefront of the struggle for the consolidation and lasting peace. It is hoped that Japan, along with other countries, can also make its due contribution to the noble cause of developing international cooperation, because the success of this cause ultimately depends on the sincerity and efforts of the people of all countries and all nations.

However, one must not close one's eyes to the fact that there are still many obstacles on the road to lasting peace. The fact shows that the warming of the international situation is obviously not to the liking of some fanatical advocates of the "position of strength" policy. They are doing everything possible to prevent the international situation from improving. Precisely because of this, no task is more important at present than uniting the efforts of all countries to further ease tensions and eliminate the threat of war.

Unfortunately, in Japan, it seems that those who advocate maintaining tension between countries have not disappeared. They are trying to obstruct the normalization of the situation in the Far East, advocating that Japan should join military blocs, advocating national militarization and maintaining foreign military bases on its territory. It is quite obvious that their line is contrary to the spirit of the times, and this line contains dangerous consequences for the national interests of Japan and for the Japanese people.

Under the current situation of easing international tensions, at a stage approaching important talks on some international issues that have already matured, any actions that may hinder the talks and may create additional obstacles in establishing mutual understanding between countries are particularly regrettable and should be universally condemned.

From the letters of people from all walks of life in Japan, it can be seen that the conspiracies of some people who oppose easing international tensions have aroused the anxiety of the Japanese people. This is also understandable, because the Japanese people have personally experienced all the disasters of war and the world's first atomic bomb explosion. They do not want the atomic tragedy to be repeated, let alone a more tragic and incomparable tragedy. Their interests are contrary to the interests of those who are trying to push Japan onto the dangerous road of revanchism and the arms race. In this situation, the widespread movement in Japan to prevent war, to promote friendship among the people of all countries, and to take joint action for Japan to pursue a neutral policy and not participate in military blocs, has great positive significance.

From the letter, it can be seen that the issue of the state of Soviet-Japanese relations also makes the Japanese public uneasy. Undoubtedly, this relationship can be better developed if not only the Soviet side expresses its sincerity in improving this relationship. If a frank attitude is adopted, then it should be stated bluntly that some groups in Japan are trying to spread unfriendliness and distrust towards the Soviet Union, making people doubt the sincerity of the Soviet Union.

We firmly believe that the truth of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy will surely find its way to the Japanese people.

Everyone without prejudice is very clear that the Soviet Union has no other intention towards neighboring Japan than to hope to live in peace and friendship with it, and to cooperate with it on the basis of equality, mutual respect for independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs.

We advocate establishing genuine good-neighborly relations, and advocate expanding mutually beneficial trade, cultural and other ties to promote the rapprochement between Japan and the Soviet Union for the benefit of the people of Japan and the Soviet Union. The victorious implementation of the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for the development of the national economy is opening up huge prospects for expanding trade between our two countries.

I sincerely hope that in the new year of 1960, new roads will be laid for achieving trust and mutual understanding between our two countries and for fundamentally improving Soviet-Japanese relations, which will not only benefit the two countries, but also help ensure lasting peace throughout the Far East.

I hope that the new year will be a year of further strengthening the friendship of all countries and consolidating universal peace. On the eve of the New Year, I sincerely wish the Japanese people peace, happiness, and prosperity.

    赫鲁晓夫对日本人士谈国际形势
    联合各国努力进一步缓和紧张局势和消除战争威胁是目前最重要的任务苏联将尽力使最高级会议获得圆满结果任何可能妨碍会谈和阻碍各国建立相互谅解的行为都应当受到谴责日本某些势力阻挠远东局势正常化和主张军国主义化的路线对日本民族利益包藏危险后果
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科1959年12月31日电：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫给日本公众代表、通讯社和报界人士的复信：
    日本的某些社会团体、通讯社、报纸、电台和电视台的编辑局和以及某些个人写了一些信给我。这些信表达了对苏联人民的友好和亲善感情，同时也希望得到对国际局势和苏日关系中的某些问题的答复。
    收到的信件中包括下述一些人写的信：日本煤矿工会委员长原茂先生、共同通讯社编辑局长久我先生、“中部日本新闻”编辑局长铃木、日本电视广播公司总经理足立先生、“读卖新闻”编辑局长小岛和“朝日新闻周刊”编辑局长和田先生等人。
    我还收到了八郎潟城禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会以及鹿儿岛和大口市电报局的一批工人的热情信件。
    非常遗憾，因为没有可能给所有寄信来的团体和个人写回信，我想首先感谢他们的盛意，并且代表苏联人和我个人向全体日本人民致以衷心的问候和最美好的新年祝愿。
    在新的1960年的前夕，可以满意地指出，即将消逝去的一年标志着国际气候的显著转暖。有愈来愈广泛的居民以及社会活动家、议会和国家的活动家已经意识到“冷战”、军备竞赛、积存核武器和其他大规模毁灭性手段是不智和危险的。“实力地位”政策从来没有给任何人以吉兆。如果有谁不顾常识企图继续这种政策，那么它只会导致采用破坏性最大的大规模毁灭性武器的战争的爆发，使物质和精神财富遭到巨大破坏。
    在这种情况下，令人可慰的是：现在甚至在那些不久以前还把用原子弹进行威胁和在战争边缘上踩钢丝看作时髦的国家里，有利于消除国际紧张局势和通过谈判解决争端的情绪也在逐渐加强。1959年苏联的国家领导人同美国、英国和其他国家领导人的会见和会谈在这方面起了重要作用。现在已对1960年春天进行苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑会晤一事达成协议。苏联期望能在这次会上采取共同步骤来寻找就裁军和其他迫切的国际问题达成协议的途径。苏联政府将尽一切努力使会议获得圆满结果。
    这样看来，对目前局势比较清醒的估计已在开始占上风，和平共处的原则在国际生活中日益确立。“冷战”的冰层开冻了，这使各国人民产生很大的希望，当然，对已取得的成就不应估计过高。这只是开端，不过这是一个良好的开端，它可能而且应当得到进一步的发展，以利于和平。
    苏联在坚定不移地尽一切努力，争取通过谈判达成协议，以保证社会制度不同的各国和平共处和实行互利的合作，1959年9月苏联政府在联合国大会第十四届会议上提出的全面彻底裁军的建议，就是为了要达到这个崇高的目标。如果解散所有的武装部队、完全禁止核武器和销毁它的储备，取消在别国领土上的军事基地，解散总参谋部和军事部，如果所有的士兵都回家去，那末就没有一个国家会有进行战争的手段了。这样一来，就可以不再把庞大的物力人力白白地消耗在破坏性的而不是建设性目的上了。那时，持久可靠的和平就会成为现实。在这种和平条件下，就可以把全部科学、技术、工业手段——全部生产力用来改善人民生活，用来消除经济和文化落后状态，用来造福人们而不是危害人们。
    苏联关于全面彻底裁军的建议已受到联合国赞同并在世界各国得到良好反应。日本煤矿工会委员长原茂先生在信中说，成千上万的日本矿工，同所有和平拥护者一样，都对苏联政府不倦地致力于保卫和平、对它提出的裁军建议表示感激。“朝日新闻周刊”的编辑局长和田先生说，苏联政府在对“缓和国际紧张局势的事业作出卓越的贡献”。我们感到高兴的是，苏联政府的努力受到了日本各界的拥护和支持。
    苏联人过去和现在一直站在争取巩固和持久和平的战士的前列。希望日本能同其他国家一道也对发展国际合作的崇高事业作出应有的贡献，因为这一事业的成功归根结蒂取决于各国人民和一切国家的诚意和努力。
    但是，决不能闭眼不看：在达到持久和平的道路上还有许多障碍。事实说明，国际局势的转暖显然并不合某些“实力地位”政策狂热鼓动者的心意。他们千方百计地不让国际局势改善。正因为如此，目前没有一个任务比联合各国的努力来进一步缓和紧张局势和消除战争威胁更为重要的了。
    非常遗憾，在日本，主张保持各国之间的紧张关系的人看来还没有绝迹。他们企图阻挠远东局势的正常化，鼓吹日本应加入军事集团，主张国家军国主义化和在本国领土上保持外国军事基地。十分明显，他们的路线是违背时代精神的，这种路线对日本的民族利益、对日本人民都包藏着危险的后果。
    在目前国际紧张局势出现缓和的形势下，在临近就已经成熟了的一些国际问题进行重要会谈的阶段，任何可能妨碍会谈和可能在建立各国之间的相互谅解方面制造额外障碍的行为都令人感到特别遗憾，并应当受到普遍的谴责。
    从日本各界人士的信中可以看出，一些反对缓和国际紧张局势的人的阴谋引起了日本人民的不安。这也是可以理解的，因为日本人民亲身经受过战争和世界上第一颗原子弹爆炸的一切灾难。他们不希望原子悲剧重演，何况是更加惨重得无可比拟的悲剧呢。他们的利益同那些企图把日本推向复仇主义和军备竞赛的危险道路上去的人的利益是背道而驰的，在这种情况下，日本广泛展开的、为防止战争、为各国人民友谊、为日本执行中立和不参加军事集团政策采取联合行动的运动，有重大的积极意义。
    从信中可以看出，苏日关系状况问题也使日本公众感到不安。无疑，如果不单单苏联方面表示改善这种关系的诚意，这种关系是可以得到更好发展的。如果采取坦率的态度，那就应该直言不讳地说，日本有某些集团企图散播对苏联的不友好和不信任，使人对苏联的诚意表示怀疑。
    我们坚信，苏联和平政策的真相一定能够找到通向日本人民的道路的。
    每个没有成见的人都很清楚，苏联对近邻日本，除了希望同它和平友好相处，同它在平等、互相尊重独立和主权、互不干涉内政的基础上实行合作以外，没有别的意图。
    我们主张建立真正的睦邻关系，主张扩大互利的贸易、文化和其他联系，以促进日本和苏联为了日本和苏联两国人民的利益而接近。苏联发展国民经济七年计划的胜利执行在为扩大我们两国的贸易开辟巨大的前景。
    我谨希望，在新的1960年里将为达到我们两国的信任和互相谅解、为苏日关系的根本改善敷设新的道路，这不仅有利于两国，而且有利于保障整个远东的持久和平。
    希望新的一年是各国友谊进一步加强和普遍和平得到巩固的一年。在新年前夕，我衷心祝贺日本人民和平、幸福和繁荣昌盛。
